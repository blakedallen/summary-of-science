In general, 21 cm spectral features will display angular structure as well as structure in redshift space\ndue to inhomogeneities in the gas density field, hydrogen\nionized fraction, and spin temperature. Several different\nsignatures have been investigated in the recent literature:\n(a) the fluctuations in the 21 cm line emission induced by\nthe 'cosmic web' that develops at early times in cold dark\nmatter (CDM)-dominated cosmologies (Tozzi et al. 2000)\nand by 'minihalos' with virial temperatures below 104 K\n(Iliev et al. 2002,2003); (b) the global feature ('reionization step') in the continuum spectrum of the radio sky\nthat may mark the abrupt overlapping phase of individual\nintergalactic H II regions (Shaver et al. 1999); (c) and the\n21 cm narrow lines generated in absorption against very\nhigh redshift radio sources by the neutral IGM (Carilli,\nGnedin, & Owen 2002) and by intervening minihalos and\nprotogalactic disks (Furlanetto & Loeb 2002).\nIn this paper, we use numerical simulations of hydrogen\nreionization by stellar sources in the context of \u039bCDM\ncosmogonies to estimate the radio signal expected from\nthe diffuse, low density IGM during the 'gray age' (Carilli et al. 2002). This is the era between the formation\nof the first luminous objects and the epoch of complete\nreionization, when the IGM is a mixture of neutral, partially ionized, and fully ionized structures. The important\npoint is that the early generation of stars that ultimately\nionizes the universe will also generate a background radiation field of Ly\u03b1 photons arising from their collective redshifted UV continua. It is the presence of a sufficient flux of\nLy\u03b1 photons that renders the neutral IGM 'visible' against\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nDespite much recent theoretical and observational\nprogress in our understanding of the formation of early\ncosmic structures and the high redshift universe, many\nfundamental questions remain, at best, only partially answered. We know that at least some galaxies and quasars\nwere already shining when the universe was less than 109\nyr old. But when did the first luminous objects form,\nand what was their impact on the surrounding intergalactic gas? While the excess H I absorption measured in the\nspectra of z \u223c 6 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has been interpreted as the signature of the trailing\nedge of the cosmic reionization epoch (Becker et al. 2001;\nFan et al. 2002), the recent analysis of the first year data\nfrom the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)\nsatellite infers a mean optical depth to Thomson scattering \u03c4e \u223c 0.17, suggesting that the universe was reionized\nat higher redshift (Kogut et al. 2003; Spergel et al. 2003).\nThis is an indication of significant star-formation activity at very early times. In currently popular cosmological\nscenarios it is an early generation of subgalactic stellar\nsystems \u2013 aided perhaps by a seed population of accreting black holes in their nuclei \u2013 that may have generated\nthe ultraviolet radiation that ended the cosmic 'dark ages'\nand reionized most of the hydrogen in the universe around\nredshift 8\u201315. The detailed thermal history of the baryons\nduring and soon after these crucial formative stages depends on the power-spectrum of density fluctuations on\nsmall scales and on a complex network of poorly understood 'feedback' mechanisms, and remains one of the missing link in galaxy formation and evolution studies.\nAn alternative way to probe the end of the cosmic 'dark\nages' and discriminate between different reionization histories is through 21 cm tomography. It has also long been\nknown (e.g. Field 1959; Sunyaev & Zel'dovich 1975; Hogan\n& Rees 1979; Scott & Rees 1990; Subramanian & Padmanabhan 1993) that neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic\n1 Max-Planck-Institut\n\nf\u00fcr Astrophysik, Karl-Schwarzschild-Strasse 1, 85748 Garching, Germany.\nof Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064.\n3 Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri, Largo E.

In\n\u00a7 2 we summarize the physics of 21 cm excitation. In \u00a7 3\nwe show that, since a 'typical' early stellar population will\nradiate a large number of UV continuum photons with\nenergies between 10.2 and 13.6 eV (hereafter Ly\u03b1\u2013c ) to\nwhich the IGM is transparent, there will be an extended\nperiod of time prior to full reionization where fluctuations\nin the gas density and hydrogen ionized fraction may be\ndetected at 21 (1 + z) cm. Numerical simulations of hydrogen reionization by Population III stars are presented\nin \u00a7 4. Simulated radio maps are generated and the detectability of fluctuations in the sky brightness discussed\nin \u00a7 5. Finally, in \u00a7 6 we give our conclusions.\n2. LYMAN-ALPHA PUMPING\n\nA quick summary of the physics of 21 cm radiation will\nillustrate the basic ideas behind this work (see MMR for\nmore details). The emission or absorption of 21 cm photons from a neutral IGM is governed by the hydrogen spin\ntemperature, TS , defined by\nn1 /n0 = 3 exp(\u2212T\u2217 /TS ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n0 and n1 are the number densities of atoms in\nthe singlet and triplet n = 1 hyperfine levels and T\u2217 =\n0.068 K is the excitation temperature of the transition.\nIn the presence of only the CMB radiation with TCMB =\n2.73 (1 + z) K, the spin states will reach thermal equilibrium with the CMB on a timescale of T\u2217 /(TCMB A10 ) \u2248\n3 \u00d7 105 (1 + z)\u22121 yr (A10 = 2.85 \u00d7 10\u221215 s\u22121 is the spontaneous decay rate of the hyperfine transition of atomic\nhydrogen), and intergalactic H I will produce neither an\nabsorption nor an emission signature. Thus, a mechanism\nis required that decouples TS and TCMB , e.g. by coupling\nthe spin temperature instead to the kinetic temperature\nTK of the gas itself. Two mechanisms are available, spinexchange collisions between hydrogen atoms (Purcell &\nField 1956) and scattering by Ly\u03b1 photons (Wouthuysen 1952; Field 1958; Field 1959). The first process\nproceeds at a rate that is too small for realistic IGM\ndensities at the redshifts of interest, although collisions\nwill be important in dense regions with gas overdensities\n\u22122\n\u03b4>\n\u223c 20[(1 + z)/10] , like virialized minihalos (Iliev et al.\n2002,2003; Furlanetto & Loeb 2002). It is Ly\u03b1 pumping\nthat dominates instead in the diffuse IGM, by mixing the\nhyperfine levels of neutral hydrogen in its ground state via\nintermediate transitions to the 2p state, the WouthuysenField process. In this case,\nP\u03b1 =\n\n4\u03c0J\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\n,\nh P \u03bd\u03b1\n\n(2)\n\nis the rate at which Ly\u03b1 photons of energy hP \u03bd\u03b1 in an\nisotropic background of intensity J\u03b1 are scattered by an H\natom in the gas, and\nPth \u2261\n\n27A10 TCMB\n= 7.6 \u00d7 10\u221213 (1 + z) s\u22121 ,\n4T\u2217\n\n(3)\n\nis the critical ('thermalization') scattering rate which, if\nmuch exceeded, would drive TS away from TCMBR and towards TK (MMR). In the above equations \u03c3\u03b1 = \u03c3\u03bd d\u03bd =\n\u03c0e2 f\u03b1 /me c = 0.011 cm2 Hz is the integrated Ly\u03b1 scattering cross section. The condition P\u03b1 > Pth can also be\nrewritten as\nJ\u03b1 > Jth = 9 \u00d7 10\u221223(1 + z) ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 sr\u22121 . (4)\nAt z = 8 this thermalization rate corresponds to\nPth \u03bd\u03b1 /(cnH \u03c3\u03b1 ) <\n\u223c 1/2 Ly\u03b1 photons per hydrogen atom,\nwhere nH is the intergalactic mean hydrogen density.\n3. UV SPECTRA OF EARLY STELLAR POPULATIONS\n\nAt the epochs of interest, Ly\u03b1 pumping will efficiently\n\u221221\nergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121\ndecouple TS from TCMB if J\u03b1 >\n\u223c 10\n\u22121\nsr . The issue is then whether this critical value of J\u03b1\nwill be reached well before the epoch of complete reionization, when large regions of the IGM are still neutral.\nThe process of reionization begins as individual sources\ndrive isolated H II regions in the surrounding IGM and\nends when these ionized bubbles overlap and fill the intergalactic volume. The volume filling factor of H II regions\nin a clumpy medium reaches unity when about 1 + t/t\u0304rec\nionizing photons have been emitted per hydrogen atom,\nwhere t\u0304rec is the volume\u2013averaged hydrogen recombination timescale (Madau, Haardt, & Rees 1999). Based on\nthe density field in large scale cosmological simulations,\nonly a few Lyman-continuum (Lyc) photons per hydrogen atom may be needed (Gnedin 2000; Miralda-Escud\u00e9,\nHaehnelt, & Rees 2000) to keep the gas in mildly overdense\nregions and intergalactic filaments ionized against radiative recombinations at z \u223c 7; many photons, however,\nwill not escape local absorption, i.e. only a small fraction, fesc , of the Lyc radiation emitted by massive stars is\nexpected to escape the dense sites of star formation into\ngalaxy halos and the intergalactic space. Moreover, at\nthe earliest epochs of structure formation in CDM cosmologies the smallest nonlinear objects are the numerous\nhalos that condense with masses just above the cosmological Jeans mass. Such 'minihalos' are not yet fully resolved nor is the process of their photoevaporation captured in large-scale three-dimensional cosmological simulations. This sub-grid structure makes the treatment of\nIGM clumping in all presently available simulations only\napproximate (Haiman, Abel, & Madau 2001). The error\nin small-scale clumping (that leads to underestimating the\ntotal recombination rate) can be partly compensated by\nthe assumption of a small escape fraction.\nThe early generation of massive stars likely responsible for reionization will also generate a background radiation field of photons with energies between 10.2\u201313.6\neV to which the IGM is transparent. As each of these\nLy\u03b1\u2013c photons gets redshifted, it will ultimately reach the\nLy\u03b1 transition energy of 10.2 eV, scatter resonantly off\nneutral hydrogen, and mix the hyperfine levels. The observability of the pre-reionization IGM depends therefore\non the UV spectrum of the firsts stars, i.e. on the number of Ly\u03b1\u2013c photons emitted per H-ionizing photon, and\non the escape fraction of Lyc photons into the IGM. Figure 1 shows the number of continuum photons per octave\nnear the Ly\u03b1 frequency emitted by a stellar population,\n\n\fCIARDI & MADAU\nN\u03b1 . The UV spectral energy distribution is characterized by a strong Lyc break the size of which depends on\nage, initial mass function (IMF), metallicity, and star formation history. We have therefore normalized N\u03b1 to the\ntotal number of hydrogen-ionizing photons emitted, Nion .\nThe values shown have been computed assuming a simple stellar population of metal-free 'Population III' stars:\nthe simulations described in the next section use synthetic,\ntime-dependent spectra of zero-metallicity stars to model\nthe emission properties of stellar sources. For comparison, the figure also depicts the number of Ly\u03b1 photons\nemitted by low metallicity stars (Z = Z\u2299 /50). Note how\nthe hotter temperatures of Population III stars produce a\nsmaller Lyc break hence a smaller N\u03b1 /Nion ratio. Also,\nafter integrating over stellar age, a starburst is characterized by a ratio N\u03b1 /Nion that is a few times higher than\nin the constant star formation rate case (this is because\nof the shorter lifetime of the massive stars that produce\nradiation above 1 ryd). It is possible that the starburst\nmode may be more relevant for the galaxies responsible\nfor reionization, as stellar winds and supernovae can easily expel the gas out of the shallow potential wells of low\nmass halos, after the first burst of star formation occurs\n(Madau, Ferrara, & Rees 2001).\n\nFig. 1.- Number of continuum photons per octave in frequency\njust shortward of Ly\u03b1, N\u03b1 , emitted as a function of age by a stellar population with a Salpeter IMF (dot-dashed lines) and a Scalo\n(long-dashed lines) IMF.

A smaller escape fraction\nwill generate a stronger Ly\u03b1 diffuse radiation background\nfor a given ionizing metagalactic flux.

This is more than two orders\nof magnitude larger than the thermalization rate for efficient level mixing by Ly\u03b1 pumping. It appears then to be\na generic prediction of cosmological reionization scenarios\nby stellar sources that the Ly\u03b1 background from the early\ngeneration of stars which ultimately ionize the universe\nshould be sufficiently intense to make intergalactic diffuse\nneutral hydrogen visible against the CMB well before the\nepoch of full reionization. As shown below, detailed simulations of IGM reionization that include cosmological radiative transfer effects will confirm this basic result.\n4. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF IGM REIONIZATION\n\nIn this and the following section we use the numerical\nsimulations of hydrogen reionization by stellar sources described in CSW and Ciardi, Ferrara, & White (2003, hereafter CFW) to investigate the radio signal expected from\nthe diffuse IGM prior to reionization. We give here a brief\nsummary of the main features of the simulations, relevant\nto the present study. In the above papers, the reionization\nprocess is studied through a combination of high resolution\nN-body simulations (to describe the distribution of dark\nmatter and diffuse gas, Springel, Yoshida, & White 2001;\nYoshida, Sheth, & Diaferio 2001), a semi-analytic model\nof galaxy formation (to track gas cooling, star formation,\nand feedback from supernovae, Kauffmann et al. 1999;\nSpringel et al. 2001) and the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code CRASH (to follow the propagation of ionizing photons into the IGM, Ciardi et al. 2001; Maselli, Ferrara, &\nCiardi 2003). The simulations, spanning the redshift range\nz = 6 \u2212 20, are performed for a \u039bCDM cosmology with\n(\u03a9m , \u03a9\u039b , \u03c38 , h, \u03a9b , n) = (0.3, 0.7, 0.9, 0.7, 0.04, 1). The\nsimulation box has a comoving length of L = 20h\u22121 Mpc\nand a particle mass of Mp = 1.7 \u00d7 108h\u22121 M\u2299 . This choice\nof the parameters allows to simulate a region of the universe with 'mean' properties, thus avoiding biases due to\ncosmic variance on small scales and, at the same time, to\nresolve the objects that produce the bulk of the ionizing\nradiation (Ciardi 2002). Each output of the simulation\nprovides the gas distribution inside the box together with\na galaxy catalog containing, among other quantities, their\npositions, stellar masses, and star formation rates. As discussed in \u00a7 5, two sets of simulations will be used, with\ndifferent choices for the galaxy emission properties. At\neach output, the propagation into the IGM of the ionizing\nphotons emitted by the simulated galaxy population is followed with the radiative transfer code CRASH. The code has\nbeen tested to ensure a good convergence in the ionization\nfraction for a wide range of densities. The calculation is\nperformed over a N = 1283 grid. The gas (pure hydrogen)\ndistribution is assumed to track the dark matter. While\nradiation above 13.6 eV from each source is fully absorbed\nat the ionization front surrounding it, the Ly\u03b1\u2013c radiation is free to propagate and fill the space in between the\nH II regions. Since numerous sources are contributing to\nthe Ly\u03b1 background throughout the universe, its flux is\nnearly isotropic in the cosmic frame of reference, and is\n\n\f4\n\nPROBING BEYOND THE REIONIZATION EPOCH\n\ngiven by\nJ\u03b1 (z) =\n\nc\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nzmax\n\n\u01eb(\u03bd \u2032 , z \u2032 )\nz\n\n(1 + z)3 dt\ndz \u2032 ,\n(1 + z \u2032 )3 dz \u2032\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the proper emissivity \u01eb(\u03bd \u2032 , z \u2032 ) can be written as\n\u01eb(\u03bd \u2032 , z \u2032 ) =\n\n(1 + z \u2032 )3\nM\u2217 (z \u2032 )S(\u03bd \u2032 ).\nL3\n\n(7)\n\nHere, \u03bd \u2032 \u2261 \u03bd\u03b1 (1 + z \u2032 )/(1 + z), M\u2217 (z \u2032 ) is the total stellar\nmass in the simulation box at redshift z \u2032 , and S(\u03bd \u2032 ) is the\ntime-dependent spectral energy distribution at frequency\n\u03bd \u2032 . Since the UV photon production is rapidly decreasing\nwith stellar age, M\u2217 (z \u2032 ) is the mass of newly (i.e. in the\ntimescale between two outputs of the simulation) formed\nstars, i.e. we neglect the contribution from stars formed\nin previous outputs. In equation (6) we have assumed\nthat Ly\u03b1 photons are not attenuated by the intervening\nIGM, and that the IGM is opaque to ionizing photons\nprior to reionization, z > zion . Thus, the integration over\nredshift is carried out only up to 1 + zmax = 4(1 + z)/3.\nIn Figure 2 the resulting Ly\u03b1 background intensity is depicted as a function of redshift, together with the volumeaveraged ionization fraction xv , for the two simulation\nruns. The figure clearly shows that the expected diffuse\nflux of Ly\u03b1 photons should be sufficiently intense to decouple the spin temperature from the CMB during the 'grey\nage' from redshift \u223c 20 to complete reionization.\n\nFig. 2.- Solid lines: redshift evolution of the 'continuum'\nLy\u03b1 background, J\u03b1 , predicted by our simulations of cosmological\nreionization by stellar sources.

In the\nrest frame of the patch, the radiative transfer equation\nyields for the brightness temperature through the translucent IGM Tb = TCMB e\u2212\u03c4 + TS (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 ).

If preheating is negligible, the adiabatic expansion of\nthe universe will lower the kinetic (hence spin) temperature of the gas well below that of the CMB, and the IGM\nwill be detectable in absorption against the CMB. The\nenergetic demand for heating the IGM above the CMB\ntemperature is meager, only \u223c 0.004 eV per particle at\nz \u223c 10. Consequently, even relatively inefficient heating\nmechanisms may be important warming sources as structure develops before the universe was actually reionized,\nsuch as Ly\u03b1 heating (MMR) and X-ray heating (MMR;\nVenkatesan, Giroux, & Shull 2001) in low density regions,\nand shock heating of the gas in high density regions (Carilli\net al. 2002). In the cosmological simulations of Carilli et al.\n(2002), the IGM is reionized 'late' but the volume-averaged\nkinetic and spin temperatures of the gas exceed significantly TCMB already at redshifts 14 and 10, respectively.\nIn the following we will focus on the radio emission signal\nexpected from our simulations in the limit TS \u226b TCMB .\n5.1.

The nine panels show the differential antenna temperature\nlog (\u03b4Tb /K) at redshifts (from top to bottom and left to right) z = 13.5, 12.8, 12.0, 11.3, 10.6, 9.9, 9.3, 8.7, and 8.1. The maps refer to the\nemission produced by a slice of gas of comoving thickness L/N 1/3 = 220 kpc.\n\nparameters leads to a reionization epoch zion \u2248 8 (defined\nhere as the redshift where the volume-averaged ionization\nfraction, xv , reaches unity). We use the expressions derived in equations (8)-(10) together with our simulations to\naccount for the spatial distribution of structures and their\ndifferent ionization levels during the reionization process.\nMaps of the antenna temperature can be thus constructed\nat each redshift based on equation (10), with T in equation\n(9) derived from the simulations along each line-of-sight.\nIn Figure 3, the resulting \u03b4Tb maps are shown for different redshifts. The maps refer to the emission produced\nby a slice of the simulation box of comoving thickness\nL/N 1/3 = 220 kpc. Highly ionized regions (the dark areas\nin the map) initially occupy only a small fraction of the\nvolume. At redshift 12, when about 90% of the IGM is still\nneutral, \u03b4Tb reaches values \u223c 0.1 K in mildly overdense regions with \u03b4 greater than a few: the antenna temperature\ndrops rapidly with cosmic time as reionization proceeds.\nBy redshift of 11 or so, several bubbles have already overlapped as the first sources of ionizing photons are highly\nclustered. Finally, by z = 8.7 most of the volume has been\nphotoionized with only a few dense H I patches surviving.\nThe distribution of \u03b4Tb values is shown in Figure 4. At\nz = 18.5, most of the IGM is still neutral, and the brightness temperatures reflect density inhomogeneities still in\nthe linear regime. As reionization gets under way, the\ndistribution becomes double peaked due to the two-phase\nstructure of the IGM: the rightmost peak corresponds\nto the neutral phase, while the left peak is associated\nwith ionized gas. The pixel fraction corresponding to\n\u03b4Tb \u226a 10\u22128 K is not drawn in the figure: this increases\nby two orders of magnitude as zion is approached. With\ndecreasing redshift, more pixels are transferred from the\n\nright to the left peak. While the average 21 cm signal is\ntwo orders of magnitude lower than that of the CMB (and\nwill be swamped by the much stronger non-thermal backgrounds that dominate the radio sky at meter wavelengths\nand that must be removed), its fluctuations \u2013 induced now\nboth by inhomogeneities in the gas density and in the hydrogen ionized fraction \u2013 will greatly exceed those of the\nCMB. Brightness temperature fluctuations will be present\nboth in frequency and in angle across the sky, and should\nbe much easier to detect.\n\nFig. 4.- Distribution in our 'late reionization' simulation box of\nthe differential antenna temperature \u03b4Tb (K) at redshifts z = 18.5\n(solid line), 12.8 (dotted line), 9.9 (small-dashed line), 8.7 (longdashed line) and 8.1 (dotted-dashed line).\n\n\f6\n\nPROBING BEYOND THE REIONIZATION EPOCH\nFig. 6.- Same as the upper panel of Fig. 5 for two different\nbandwidths, \u2206\u03bd = 0.1 (dotted lines) and 1 MHz (solid).\n\nAt lower redshift h\u03b4Tb2 i1/2 decreases and it drops dramatically at z <\n\u223c 8.5, when the IGM gets close to complete\nreionization. Above redshift 11, the rms decreases again\nas the development of structures in the universe is less advanced. Although inhomogeneities in the ionized fraction\ndrop to zero as the IGM is mostly neutral, a patchwork\nof radio emission is produced by regions with overdensities still in the linear regime and by voids. Note that the\nerrors due to the box finiteness allow a correct evaluation\nof h\u03b4Tb2 i1/2 only for \u2206\u03b8 <\n\u223c 8 arcmin. To better gauge the\nsuppression effect of cosmological reionization on the sky\nbrightness at 21 (1 + z) cm, we have plotted in the lower\npanel the rms temperature fluctuations expected in the\nsame simulation but with radiation sources switched off.\n\nFig. 5.- Upper panel: Expected rms brightness temperature\nfluctuations, h\u03b4Tb2 i1/2 , in our 'late reionization' simulation box as a\nfunction of beam size \u2206\u03b8.

The bandwidth is fixed for each redshift and equal to\n\u2206\u03bd = 1 MHz. The signal peaks at z \u223c 10.5 (\u223c 120 MHz),\ncorresponding to the epoch when several high density neutral regions are still present, but H II occupies roughly half\nof the volume. As the mass variance is larger on small\nscales, at a fixed bandwidth h\u03b4Tb2 i1/2 increases with decreasing angular scale from about 5 to 20 mK.\n\nFig. 7.- Expected rms brightness temperature fluctuations in the\n'late reionization' case as a function of the observed frequency, \u03bdobs ,\nfor different choices of the beam angle, \u2206\u03b8. Notation is the same as\nin Fig. 5. The bandwidth is \u2206\u03bd = 1 MHz.\n\nWe have also checked that a smaller bandwidth of\n\u2206\u03bd = 0.1 MHz gives roughly the same rms at high redshifts, while this becomes larger on small scales as z decreases (Fig. 6). This is related to the fact that inhomogeneities in the gas density and in the hydrogen ionized\nfractions, which increase with decreasing redshift, are better resolved by a smaller bandwidth. The expected rms\nbrightness temperature fluctuations as a function of the\nobserved frequency, \u03bdobs , are shown in Figure 7 for our\n'late reionization' run, for different choices of beam size,\nand for a bandwidth \u2206\u03bd = 1 MHz. The temperature fluctuations remain approximately constant over a wide range\nof redshift, drastically declining only when the IGM becomes highly ionized.\n5.2. 'Early reionization' model\nRecently, the discovery by the WMAP satellite of a large\noptical depth to Thomson scattering (Kogut et al. 2003;\nSpergel et al. 2003) suggests that the universe was reionized at zion > 10. We have thus repeated the same analyses\nof \u00a7 5.1 for a simulation in which the galaxy emission properties are computed assuming instead a Larson IMF (i.e. a\n\n\fCIARDI & MADAU\nSalpeter function with a cutoff below 5 M\u2299 ) and an escape\nfraction fesc = 20% (run L20 in CFW). These parameters lead to an 'early reionization' epoch, zion \u2248 13, more\nconsistent with the WMAP observations (see CFW for an\nextensive discussion). The overall, qualitative results are\nthe same described in the previous Section for the 'late\nreionization' case. Here, we limit our discussion to the\nexpected value of the rms brightness temperature fluctuations, shown in Figure 8. The same curves in Figure 8 and\nFigure 5 (upper panel) correspond to redshifts of equivalent volume averaged ionization fraction, e.g., xv \u223c 0.5 is\nreached at z = 14.9 (10.4) in the 'early (late) reionization'\ncase and it corresponds to the short-dashed line in both\nFigures. The behavior is similar to the 'late reionization'\nmodel, except that now the neutral IGM is detectable only\nat radio frequencies below 100 MHz.\n\nFig. 8.- Same as in Fig. 5 (upper panel) but in the 'early reionization' case. Note how rms brightness temperature fluctuations on\nall scales now drop below 2 mK at z <\n\u223c 13, making the IGM effectively undetectable in 21 cm radiation above radio frequencies of 100\nMHz.\n\n6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have used numerical simulations of hydrogen reionization by stellar sources in the context of a\n\u039bCDM cosmogony to investigate the 21 (1 + z) cm radio\nbackground expected prior to the epoch of cosmological\nreionization. Here, in addition to the emission induced\nby the 'cosmic web' (Tozzi et al. 2000), we can also estimate the contribution from inhomogeneities in the hydrogen ionized fraction. A further contribution comes from\nthe minihalos with virial temperatures below the threshold\nfor atomic cooling that form in abundance at high redshift,\nand are sufficiently hot and dense to emit collisionallyexcited 21 cm radiation (Iliev et al. 2002,2003). These\nhalos are not resolved in our numerical simulations. While\nthe combined signal from many minihalos within a sufficiently large volume is in principle detectable, the 21 (1+z)\ncm flux from these objects will typically be dominated\nby the radio background from the neutral IGM (since the\nH I mass will always be larger in the non-collapsed phase;\nOh & Mack 2003), except in the very earliest stages of\nstructure formation when J\u03b1 < Jth , i.e. at z > 20. At\n\n7\n\nz > 12, the predicted brightness temperature fluctuations\nfrom minihalos on arcmin scales are typically much smaller\nthan those expected from the diffuse IGM. As reionization\nproceeds, feedback effects (like photoevaporation) on minihalos may also decrease their expected 21 cm signal. Here,\nwe have focused on emission from the diffuse, low density\ngas. The search at 21 cm for the epoch of first light has become one of the main science drivers of the LOw Frequency\nARray (LOFAR). Radio 21 cm tomography may probe the\ntopology of reionization, map the cosmic 'gray age', i.e.\nthe transition from the post-recombination universe to one\npopulated with radiation sources, and effectively open up\nmuch of the universe to a direct study of the reheating and\nreionization epochs. On scales \u223c 5 arcmin, predicted rms\nbrightness temperature fluctuations can exceed 5 mK for\na 1 MHz bandwidth. The expected sensitivity of LOFAR\non these scales is about 10 mK with a 1000 h integration\n(for a confidence level of 5 times the noise and \u2206\u03bd = 1\nMHz, see http://www.astron.nl/lofar/science/), enough to\ndetect all fluctuations above 2 \u03c3. While remaining an extremely challenging project due to foreground contamination from unresolved extragalactic radio sources (Di Matteo et al. 2002) and free-free emission from the same halos\nthat reionize the universe (Oh & Mack 2003), the detection and imaging of large-scale structure prior to reionization breakthrough remains a tantalizing possibility within\nrange of the next generation of radio arrays.\nThe main results of this study can be summarized as\nfollows.\n\u2022 At epochs when the IGM is still mainly neutral, the\nsimulated early galaxy population provides enough\nLy\u03b1\u2013c photons to decouple TS from TCMB . As in\nthe same redshift range the IGM is expected to be\n'warm', the 21 cm line would be seen in emission.\n\u2022 The rms temperature fluctuations relative to the\nmean, h\u03b4Tb2 i1/2 , increase with decreasing angular\nscale, as variance is larger on smaller scales. The\nsignal peaks at an epoch when several high density\nneutral regions are still present, but H II occupies\nroughly half of the volume.\n\u2022 Depending on the redshift of reionization breakthrough, broad-beam observations at frequencies <\n\u223c\n150 MHz (below 100 MHz for the 'early reionization' scenario) with the next generation of radio telescopes should reveal angular fluctuations in the sky\nbrightness temperature in the range 5\u201320 mK (1\u03c3)\non scales <\n\u223c 5 arcmin.\nWe have benefited from discussions with T.
