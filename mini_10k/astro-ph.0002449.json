Traditionally, DLAS are believed\nto be the progenitors of present day spiral galaxies (Wolfe\n1995) and thus any model of galaxy formation must also\naccount for their properties. The current wealth of observational data on DLAS includes their number density, column density distribution, metallicities, and kinematic properties - see Lanzetta, Wolfe & Turnshek (1995); StorrieLombardi, Irwin, & MCMahon (1996); Storrie-Lombardi &\nWolfe (2000); Pettini et al. (1994); Lu et al. (1996); Pettini\net al. (1997); Prochaska & Wolfe (1997b, 1998, 1999, 2000);\nWolfe & Prochaska (2000). These data potentially provide\nimportant constraints on cosmology and theories of galaxy\nformation. Here we especially focus on the new kinematic\ndata.\nPreviously, the number density of DLAS has been\n\nused to provide constraints on cosmological models (Mo &\nMiralda-Escude 1994; Kauffmann & Charlot 1994; Ma &\nBertschinger 1994; Klypin et al. 1995). These studies assumed a simple correspondance between collapsed dark matter halos and cold gas to obtain upper limits on the amount\nof cold gas that could be present. Gas cooling, star formation, supernovae feedback, and ionization were neglected. A\ndifferent approach was used by Lanzetta et al. (1995); Wolfe\net al. (1995); Pei & Fall (1995); Pei, Fall & Hauser (1999), in\nwhich the observed metallicities and observed number densities of the DLAS were used to model global star formation\nand chemical enrichment in a self-consistent way. The latter\napproach was set in a classical \"closed-box\" style framework\nrather than a cosmological context.\nClearly, in order to model DLAS realistically one needs\nto include the astrophysical processes of gas dynamics and\ncooling, star formation, and chemical enrichment within a\ncosmological framework. However, this is a challenge with\nour current theoretical and numerical capability. Cosmo-\n\n\f2\n\nAriyeh H. Maller, Jason X. Prochaska, Rachel S. Somerville and Joel R. Primack\n\nlogical N -body simulations with hydrodynamics are hampered by the usual limitations of volume and resolution.\nThis is apparent in, for example, the recent work by Gardner\net al. (1999), in which it was found that even rather highresolution hydrodynamical simulations could not account for\nmost of the observed DLAS. Gardner et al. (1999) concluded\nthat the majority of the damped Ly-\u03b1 absorption must arise\nfrom structures below the resolution of their simulations. In\naddition, it is well known that such simulations fail to reproduce the sizes and angular momenta of present day observed spiral galaxies (Steinmetz 1999). One might therefore\nbe suspicious of the accuracy of their representation of the\nspatial distribution of the cold gas that gives rise to DLAS\nat high redshift. Because observational samples of DLAS are\ncross-section weighted, these properties are likely to introduce crucial selection effects. Semi-analytic approaches can\ndeal with nearly arbitrary resolution and volumes, but are\nlimited in the sophistication and accuracy of their physical\n\"recipes\". In particular, most previous SAMs have focussed\non the bulk properties of galaxies, and have not attempted to\nmodel the spatial location of galaxies relative to one another\nor the spatial distribution of gas and stars within galaxies.\nThe only previous attempt to model the properties of\nDLAS in a CDM framework is the work of Kauffmann (1996)\n(hereafter K96). In K96 the radial distribution of cold gas\nin galactic discs was modelled by assuming that the initial\nangular momentum of the gas matched that of the halo, and\nthat angular momentum was conserved during the collapse.\nStar formation was then modelled using the empirical law\nof Kennicutt (1989, 1998), in which the star formation is a\nfunction of the surface density of the gas, and cuts off below a critical threshold density. K96 then showed that the\nnumber density, column density distribution, and metallicities of observed DLAS could be reasonably well reproduced\nwithin the Standard Cold Dark Matter (SCDM) cosmology,\nand predicted the distribution of circular velocities of discs\nthat would give rise to DLAS. Assuming that each observed\nDLAS corresponds to a single galactic disc, this can then be\ncompared with the observed distribution of velocity widths\nderived from the kinematics of unsaturated, low-ionization\nmetal lines (Prochaska & Wolfe 1997b, 1998).\nProchaska & Wolfe found the velocity distribution predicted by K96 to be strongly inconsistent with their data.\nFurthermore Jedamzik & Prochaska (1998) showed that the\nthick rotating disc model favored by Prochaska & Wolfe\n(1997b) could only be reconciled with a finely tuned CDM\nmodel. But CDM actually predicts that halos will have much\nsubstructure, and Haehnelt, Steinmetz & Rauch (1998)\nfound that large \u2206v velocity profiles consistent with those\nobserved by Prochaska & Wolfe are produced in their very\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. These profiles\narose not from the rotation of a single disc, but from lines\nof sight intersecting multiple proto-galactic \"clumps\". Subsequently, McDonald & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 (1999) also showed\nwith a simple analytical model that DLAS produced by intersection with a few gas clouds could create kinematics consistent with the observations in a CDM universe.\nThese results were encouraging but remain somewhat\ninconclusive. The hydro simulations do not allow the construction of a statistical, cross-section selected sample of\nDLAS, so it is difficult to assess how typical are the systems\nthat they identified. In addition, these simulations were re-\n\nstricted to a single cosmology (SCDM), and did not include\nstar formation or supernovae feedback. The generic difficulty\nof hydro simulations in producing reasonable discs at low\nredshift has already been noted. Therefore a further investigation using detailed semi-analytic models is worthwhile.\nIn the standard CDM picture of galaxy formation\n(based on White & Rees 1978; Blumenthal et al. 1984) gas\nis heated to the virial temperature when a halo forms and\nthen cools and falls into the centre of the halo where it subsequently forms stars. In SAMs, which include the hierarchical\nformation of structure, this process happens numerous times\nas halos continually merge and form larger structures. This\nnaturally results in halos that may contain many gaseous\ndiscs, each one associated with a sub-halo that prior to merging had been an independent halo. In this paper, we explore\nthe possibility that such a scenario can account for the observed kinematics of the DLAS in a manner analogous to the\nproto-galactic clumps of Haehnelt et al. (1998) and the gas\nclouds of McDonald & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 (1999). Here, however, the number densities, gas contents, and metallicities of\nthese proto-galaxies are determined by the full machinery of\nthe SAMs, which have been tuned to produce good agreement with the optical properties of galaxies at low and high\nredshift. We introduce new ingredients to describe the kinematics of satellite galaxies within dark matter halos, and the\nspatial distribution of cold gas in discs. We also include a\nmodel that is not based on the machinery of the SAMs to\ndemonstrate that our general conclusions are not overly dependent on the specifics of how these processes are handled\nin the SAMs.\nWe start with a review of the the observational properties of DLAS (section 2). Next, section 3 gives a brief description of the ingredients of the SAMs, and describes how\nwe simulate the observational selection process for DLAS\nand produce simulated velocity profiles. We demonstrate in\nsection 4.1 that gaseous discs with sizes determined by conservation of angular momentum fail to match the kinematic\ndata, and then in section 4.2 show that acceptable solutions\ncan be found if the gaseous discs have a large radial extent. Section 5 examines the sensitivity of our results to a\nnumber of model parameters. In section 6 we discuss the\nproperties of the gas discs in our model and compare them\nto HI observations of local spirals and with the results of\nhydro simulations. Lastly we close with some discussion and\nconclusions.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONAL PROPERTIES OF DLAS\n\nDLAS are defined as those absorption systems that have a\ncolumn density of neutral hydrogen in excess of 2 \u00d7 1020\natoms per square centimeter (Wolfe et al. 1986). Prochaska\n& Wolfe (1996, 1997a) found that the velocity profiles of low\nionization state metal lines (Si+ , Fe+ , Cr+ , etc.) trace each\nother well and therefore presumably the kinematics of the\ncold gas.\nThey therefore undertook to obtain a large sample of\nthe kinematic properties of DLAS as measured by the associated metal lines and compared them to the predictions\nfrom a number of models. All of the observations were obtained with HIRES (Vogt 1992) on the 10m Keck I telescope.\nNone of the DLAS were chosen with a priori kinematic in-\n\n\fWhat Damped Ly-alpha Systems Tell Us About the Radial Distribution of Cold Gas at High Redshift\nformation and the metal line profiles were selected according\nto strict criteria including that they not be saturated, therefore it is believed that the sample is kinematically unbiased.\nWe have taken care that our model profiles match the resolution and signal-to-noise of the observations and that they\nconform to the same profile selection criteria.\nProchaska & Wolfe (1997b, hereafter PW97) developed\nfour statistics to characterize the velocity profiles of the gas,\nwhich we also use to compare our models to the data set of\n36 velocity profiles in Prochaska & Wolfe (1998) and Wolfe\n& Prochaska (2000). The four statistics as defined in PW97\nare:\n\u2022 \u2206v, the velocity interval statistic, defined as the width\ncontaining 90% of the optical depth.\n\u2022 fmm , the mean-median statistic, defined as the distance\nbetween the mean and the median of the optical depth profile, divided by \u2206v/2.\n\u2022 fedg , the edge-leading statistic, defined as the distance\nbetween the highest peak and the mean, divided by \u2206v/2.\n\u2022 f2pk , the two-peak statistic, defined as the distance of\nthe second peak to the mean. Positive if on the same side of\nthe mean as the first peak and negative otherwise.\nThe other observational data that our modeling of DLAS\nmust conform to are the differential density distribution\nf (N ) (the number of absorbers per unit column density\nper unit absorption distance) and the distribution of metal\nabundances. The most recent determination of f (N ) comes\nfrom Storrie-Lombardi & Wolfe (2000). The metal abundances in damped systems at high redshift (z > 2) have\nmost recently been compiled by Pettini et al. (1997) and\nProchaska & Wolfe (1999, 2000).\n\n3\n\nMODELS\n\n3.1\n\nSemi-Analytic Models\n\nWe use the semi-analytic models developed by the Santa\nCruz group (Somerville 1997; Somerville & Primack 1999;\nSomerville, Primack & Faber 2000), which are based on the\ngeneral approach pioneered by White & Frenk (1991), Kauffmann, White & Guiderdoni (1993) and Cole et al. (1994).\nOur analysis is based on the fiducial \u039bCDM model presented\nin Somerville et al. (2000, hereafter SPF), which was shown\nthere to produce good agreement with many properties of\nthe observed population of Lyman-break galaxies at redshift\n\u223c 2.5 \u2212 4, and the global evolution with redshift of the star\nformation density, metallicity, and cold gas density of the\nUniverse. Below we describe the aspects of the SAMs most\nrelevant to modeling the DLAS, and refer the reader to SPF\nand Somerville & Primack (1999, hereafter SP), for further\ndetails.\n\n3.1.1\n\nhalos and sub-halos\n\nThe number density of virialized dark matter halos as a\nfunction of mass and redshift is given by an improved PressSchechter model (Sheth & Tormen 1999). The merging history of each dark matter halo at a desired output redshift is\nthen determined according to the prescription of Somerville\n\n& Kolatt (1999). As in SP, we assume that halos with velocity dispersions less than \u223c 30 km s\u22121 are photoionized\nand that the gas within them cannot cool or form stars.\nThis sets the effective mass resolution of our merger trees.\nWhen halos merge, the central galaxy in the largest progenitor halo becomes the new central galaxy and all other halos\nbecome \"sub-halos\". These sub-halos are placed at a distance fmrg rvir from the centre of the new halo, where rvir is\nthe virial radius of the new halo. We will take fmrg to be 0.5\nas in SP, but will examine the importance of this parameter\nin section 5.\nAfter each merger event, the satellite galaxies fall towards the centre of the halo due to dynamical friction. We\ncalculate the radial position of each satellite within the halo\nusing the differential formula\nrf ric\n\ndrf ric\nmh\nGmsat\nln (1 +\n).\n= \u22120.42\u01eb0.78\ndt\nVc\nmsat\n\n(1)\n\nHere mh and msat are the masses of the halo and satellite respectively, and \u01eb is a \"circularity\" parameter which describes\nthe orbit of the satellite and is drawn from a flat distribution between 0.02 and 1 as suggested by N-body simulations\n(Navarro, Frenk & White 1995). The halos are assumed to\nhave a singular isothermal density profile and to be tidally\ntruncated where the density of the sub-halo is equal to that\nof its host at its current radius. When a sub-halo reaches the\ncentre of the host, it is destroyed and the galaxy contained\nwithin it is merged with the central galaxy.\n\n3.1.2\n\ngas and stars\n\nIn our models, gas can occupy one of two phases, cold or hot.\nHalos contain hot gas, which is assumed to be shock-heated\nto the virial temperature of the halo and distributed like\nthe dark matter in a singular isothermal sphere (SIS). After\na cooling time t = tcool has elapsed, gas at a sufficiently\nhigh density (corresponding to the gas within the \"cooling\nradius\" rcool ) is assumed to cool and condense into a disc.\nThis cold gas then becomes available for star formation.\nStar formation takes place in both a quiescent and\nbursting mode. Quiescent star formation proceeds in all discs\nwhenever gas is present, according to the expression\nmcold\n\u1e41\u2217 =\n,\n(2)\n\u03c4\u2217\nwhere mcold is the mass in cold gas and \u03c4\u2217 is an efficiency factor that is fixed using nearby galaxy properties (see below).\nIn the bursting mode, which takes place following galaxygalaxy mergers, the efficiency of star formation is sharply\nincreased for a short amount of time (\u223c 50\u2013100 Myr). The\nefficiency and timescale of the starbursts has been calibrated\nusing the results of hydrodynamical simulations as described\nin SPF. The merger rate is determined by the infall of satellites onto the central galaxy, as described above, and the\ncollision of satellites with one another according to a modified mean-free path model (see SP and SPF).\nIn association with star formation, supernovae may reheat and expell the cold gas from the disc and/or the halo.\nWe model this using the disc-halo model of SP, in which\nthe efficiency of the feedback is larger for galaxies residing\nin smaller potential wells. These stars also produce metals, which are mixed with the cold inter-stellar gas, and\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nAriyeh H. Maller, Jason X. Prochaska, Rachel S. Somerville and Joel R. Primack\n\nmay be subsequently ejected and mixed with the hot halo\ngas, or ejected into the diffuse extra-halo IGM. Our simple constant-yield, instantaneous recycling model for chemical enrichment produces reasonable agreement with observations of metallicities of nearby galaxies (SP), the redshift\nevolution of the metallicity of cold gas implied by observations of DLAS, and the metallicity of the Lyman-\u03b1 forest\n(SPF).\nThe main free parameters of the model are the star formation efficiency, \u03c4\u2217 , the supernovae feedback efficiency \u01eb0SN\nand the mass of metals produced per unit mass of stars, or\neffective yield, y. As described in SP, we set these parameters so that a \"reference galaxy\" with a rotation velocity\nof 220 km s\u22121 at redshift zero has a luminosity, cold gas\nmass fraction and metallicity in agreement with local observations. Good agreement is then obtained with optical and\nHI properties of local galaxies (SP), and optical properties\nof high redshift galaxies (SPF).\n3.1.3\n\ncosmology\n\nIn this paper our fiducial models are set within a \u039bCDM\ncosmology with \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, \u03a90 = 0.3, h = 0.7, corresponding\nto model \u039bCDM.3 in SP, and the fiducial model of SPF. We\nhave presented similar results for a standard CDM (\u03a90 = 1)\ncosmology in Maller et al. (1999). As recent observational\nresults seem to favor a cosmological constant (Perlmutter\net al. 1999) and a flat universe (Melchiorri et al. 1999) we\nfeel justified in focusing on only this cosmology. In section\n5 we show that our results are not very sensitive to the\nassumed cosmology.\nWe focus our analysis on halos at an output redshift of\nz = 3. We have also performed an identical analysis on halos\nat z = 2 and find no significant differences, consistent with\nthe kinematic data and column density distribution f (N ),\nwhich show little evolution over this range. We expect to\nsee evolution both in low redshift (z < 1.5) and very high\nredshift (z > 4) systems, however we will defer discussion of\nthis to a future paper.\n3.2\n\nThe Spatial Distribution of Cold Gas\n\nThe standard SAMs do not provide us with information on\nthe radial distribution of gas and stars in the model galaxies. It is reasonable to assume that the surface density of the\ncold gas is important in determining the star formation rate\nin the gaseous discs, and in this case the radial distribution\nof gas should be modelled self-consistently within the SAMs.\nThis has been done in the models of K96. However, there\nare many uncertainties attached to modelling the structure\nof the gaseous disc in the initial collapse, and how it may be\nmodified by mergers, supernovae feedback, and secular evolution. Therefore here we choose a different approach. The\nSAMs described above produce good agreement with the observed z \u223c 3 luminosity function of Lyman-break galaxies\n(SPF). The total mass density of cold gas at this redshift is\nalso in agreement with estimates derived from observations\nfrom DLAS (Storrie-Lombardi et al. 1996; Storrie-Lombardi\n& Wolfe 2000). We can therefore ask how this gas must\nbe distributed relative to these galaxies in order to produce\nagreement with an independent set of observations, the kinematic data.\n\nWe assume that the vertical profile of the gas is exponential, and consider two functional forms for the radial\nprofiles of the cold gas: exponential and 1/R (Mestel). The\nexponential radial profile is motivated by observations of\nlocal spiral galaxies, which indicate that the light distribution of the disc is well fit by an exponential (Freeman\n1970). If one assumes that as cold gas is converted into\nstars its distribution doesn't change (which many theories of\ndisc sizes implicitly assume), then the profile of cold gas at\nhigh redshift should also be exponential. The column density of the gas may then be parameterized by two quantities, the scale length Rg and the central column density\nN0 \u2261 mgas /(2\u03c0\u03bcmH Rg2 ) (where mgas is the total mass of\ncold gas in the disc, mH is the mass of the hydrogen atom\nand \u03bc is the mean molecular weight of the gas, which we take\nto be 1.3 assuming 25% of the gas is Helium). The column\ndensity as a function of radius is given by\n\n\u0014\n\nR\nNexp (R) = N0 exp \u2212\nRg\n\n\u0015\n\n(3)\n\nThe 1/R profile, sometimes refered to as a Mestel distribution (Mestel 1963), is also motivated by observations.\nRadio observations (Bosma 1981) have shown that the surface density of HI gas is proportional to the projected surface\ndensity of the total mass, which for a perfectly flat rotation\ncurve would imply a 1/R distribution. We parameterize the\nMestel disc in terms of the truncation radius Rt and the\ncolumn density at that radius Nt \u2261 mgas /(2\u03c0\u03bcmH Rt2 ):\nRt\n.\n(4)\nR\nIn the limit of infinitely thin discs, we can calculate\nthe cross section for these distributions analytically and use\nthem to check our numeric code. For an exponential disc,\nthe inclination averaged cross section is\n\nNmes (R) = Nt\n\n\u03c3(N \u2032 > N ) =\n\n2\n\u03c0Rg2 \u03b3m\nN0\n1\nN0\n+ ln\n+ )\n(ln2\n2\nN \u03b3m\nN \u03b3m\n2\n\n(5)\n\n(Bartelmann & Loeb 1996). The variable \u03b3m = min[ NN0 , 1] is\nintroduced because a column density of N when N > N0 can\nonly be reached if the disc is inclined such that cos \u03b8 > \u03b3m .\nFor Mestel discs the corresponding expression is\n\u03c3(N \u2032 > N ) = \u03c0Rt2\n\nNt\nNt 1\n( \u2212 ln\n)\nN 2\nN\n\n(6)\n\nfor N > Nt .\n3.3\n\nSelecting and Modeling DLAS\n\nThe fiducial SPF \"standard SAMs\" provide us with a list\nof galaxies contained within a halo of a given mass or circular velocity at a given redshift. For each of these galaxies,\nwe are also provided with the internal circular velocity, radial distance from the halo centre, stellar exponential scale\nlength, and the cold gas, stellar, and metal content of its\ndisc. We distribute the galaxies randomly on circular orbits\n(we discuss the importance of this simplification in section\n5) and assign them random inclinations.\nWe create twenty realizations of a grid of halos with circular velocities between 50 km s\u22121 and 500 km s\u22121 . These\ncorrespond to different Monte Carlo realizations of the halos' merging histories. We then choose a model for the radial\n\n\fWhat Damped Ly-alpha Systems Tell Us About the Radial Distribution of Cold Gas at High Redshift\ndistribution of the gas and calculate the surface density distribution, constrained by the total gas mass as determined\nby the SAMs. We create twenty random realizations of the\nsatellite orbits and inclinations in each of the four hundred\nhalos and calculate the column density along each line of\nsight. The number of lines of sight passed through each halo\nis determined by the cross-section weighted probability of\nintersecting a halo of that mass. The total number of lines\nof sight is chosen to produce about ten thousand DLAS.\nEach line of sight that passes through a total column density exceeding 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 is then saved (along with all\nthe properties of the halo that it is found in) and analyzed\nusing the methods of PW97.\nTo create synthesized spectra we must include substructure in the gas discs, which we do by assuming that the gas\nis distributed in small clouds within the disc. The necessary\nparameters are: \u03c3int , the internal velocity dispersion of each\ncloud; Nc , the number of clouds; and \u03c3cc , their isotropic random motions. Following PW97, we take \u03c3int = 4.3 km s\u22121\nand Nc = 5; both values were derived from Voigt profile fits\nto the observations with Nc = 5 being the minimum acceptable number of individual components. Increasing the cloud\nnumber, Nc to as high as 60 does not improve the goodness of fit (PW97) for a disc model like we are considering\nhere because our model discs are relatively thin. Also we\ntake \u03c3cc = 10 km s\u22121 , since we assume that the gas discs are\ncold. These internal velocities are in addition to the circular\nvelocity of the disc and the motions between discs. For every\nline of sight the positions of the clouds are chosen by taking\nthe continuous density distribution to be a probability distribution; i.e. the likelihood of a cloud being at a position\nin space is proportional to the gas density at that point.\nSynthetic metal-line profiles are produced taking into account the varying metallicity of the gas in the multiple discs\nalong the sightline as given by the SAMs. The spectrum\nis smoothed to the resolution of the HIRES spectrograph\n(Vogt 1992), noise is added and then the four statistics of\nPW97 are applied. Finally, a Kolmagornov\u2013Smirnoff (KS)\ntest is performed to ascertain the probability that the data\nof Prochaska & Wolfe (1998) and Wolfe & Prochaska (2000)\ncould be a random subset of the model.\nIt should be noted that while we try to include all of\nthe relevant physics in the modeling, there are a number of\nsimplifications. The kinematics of sub-halos within the host\nhalos assumes that the sub-halos are on circular orbits and\nutilizes an approximate formula for the effects of dynamical\nfriction. We assume that the gas discs have a simple radial\nprofile and are axisymmetric. Also we assume that the distribution of the gas does not depend on galaxy environment\nor Hubble type. We expect that gas discs should be distorted by the presence of other galaxies in the same halo or\nby previous merger events (cf. McDonald & Miralda-Escud\u00e9\n1999; Kolatt et al. 1999) yet we ignore these effects. In the\nspirit of SAMs we hope that these assumptions will capture\nthe essential properties of the resulting DLAS to first order, and we investigate the sensitivity of our results to some\nof these assumptions. In section 6, we note the good agreement of some of the features of our model with the results\nof recent hydrodynamical simulations, and in the future we\nhope to refine our modelling by further comparisons with\nsimulations.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nRESULTS\nUnsuccessful Models: Classical Discs\n\nIn this section we investigate several models based on standard theories of the formation of galactic discs. These theories are generically based on the idea of Mestel (1963) that\nthe specific angular momentum of the material that forms\nthe galactic disc is conserved as it cools and condenses. Since\nthis idea was first applied in the classic work of Fall & Efstathiou (1980), many authors have refined this theory by\nincluding the effects of the adiabatic contraction of the dark\nhalo, the presence of a bulge, more realistic halo profiles,\nand disc stability criteria (Blumenthal et al. 1986; van der\nKruit 1987; Flores et al. 1993; Dalcanton, Spergel & Summers 1997; Mo, Mao, & White 1998; van den Bosch 1999).\nIn the simplest of such models, we assume a singular\nisothermal profile for the dark matter halo, neglect the effects of the halo contraction on the assembly of the disc, and\nassume that the profile of the cold gas after collapse has the\nform of an exponential. The exponential scale length is then\ngiven by the simple expression:\n1\nRs = \u221a \u03bbH ri\n2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bbH is the dimensionless spin parameter of the halo,\nand ri is the initial radius of the gas before collapse. In\nN -body simulations, the spin parameter \u03bbH for dark matter\nhalos is found to have a log-normal distribution with a mean\nof about 0.05 (Warren et al. 1992). A generalization of this\nmodel, using an NFW profile for the dark matter halo and\nincluding the effect of halo contraction, has recently been\npresented by Mo et al. (1998).\nIn model EXP1, we assume \u03bbH = 0.05 for all halos,\ntake ri = min[rcool , rvir ], and calculate the scale length for\neach disc from eqn 7. Note that when this approach is used\nto model stellar scale lengths, the values that we obtain are\nin good agreement with observations at redshift zero and\nredshift \u223c 3 (SP; SPF).\nHowever local observations (Broeils & Rhee 1997) find\nthat in gas rich galaxies the HI disc always has a larger\nextent than the stellar disc. To explore this scenario we try\na model where the exponential scale length of the gas is\ngiven by a multiple of the stellar disc scale length. We find\nmultiplying the scale length calculated from eqn. 7 by a\nfactor of six (model EXP6) produces the best agreement\nwith the kinematic data but can still be rejected at > 95%\nconfidence level.\nIn model MMW, we use the fitting formulae of Mo et al.\n(1998) to obtain the scale radius. In this model we do not\nuse the gas content predicted by the SAMs, but instead,\nfollowing Mo et al. (1998) we assume that the disc mass is\na fixed fraction (one tenth) of the total mass of each halo\nor sub-halo. This procedure produces roughly three times\nmore cold gas per halo than the SAMs as there is no starformation and no hot gas. Thus this model should be seen as\nan upper limit on the amount of cold gas that is available to\nform DLAS in the halo mass range we are considering. The\nspin parameter \u03bbH is chosen randomly from a log-normal\ndistribution, and the exponential scale length is found from\neqn 7. The main difference between our MMW model and\nthe actual model of Mo et al. is that we include sub-halos\n(multiple galaxies in each halo). Because Mo et al. do not\n\n5\n\n\f6\n\nAriyeh H.

Most of the\nDLAS are produced by lines of sight passing through a single disc.\n\nFigure 1. The distribution of the \u2206v statistic from the data\nset of Prochaska & Wolfe (1998) and Wolfe & Prochaska (2000)\ncompared to DLAS produced in the four models of section 4.1.\n\nsimulate the merging history of their halos, they assume that\nonly one galaxy inhabits each halo (which would correspond\nto our central galaxy).\nThe models of K96 used the assumption that the initial\nprofile of the cold gas resulted from conservation of angular momentum, and modelled star formation according to\nthe empirical law proposed by Kennicutt (1989). Kauffmann\nthen found that surface density of the gas discs tended to\nremain close to the critical surface density, as Kennicutt in\nfact observed. In our model KENN, based on these observations and the results of K96, we again take the total mass\nof cold gas from the SAMs, and distribute it at the critical\ndensity, which for a flat rotation curve is given by :\nNcr = 1.5 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122\n\n\u0010\n\nVc\n200 km s\u22121\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n1 kpc\n.\nR\n\n\u0011\n\n(8)\n\nThus for a given Vc this is a Mestel distribution, with Nt\ndetermined by the above equation and the total mass of\ncold gas.\nThe KS test results for the four statistics of PW97 for\nthese four models are shown in Table 1. The most important\nfailing of the models is in the \u2206v statistic. Fig. 1 shows the\ndistribution of \u2206v for the data and models. The \u2206v values\nproduced by these models are peaked around 50 km s\u22121 with\nvery few systems having \u2206v > 100 km s\u22121 , in sharp contrast\nto the data. This is the same result found in PW97 for a\nsingle-disc CDM model (e.g. the model of K96).

All of these\nmodels can be excluded at high confidence levels.\n\nare in fact produced by a single disc, as shown in Fig. 2.\nOnly for the EXP6 model are half of the DLAS the result of\nintersections with more than a single gas disc, and only this\nmodel has a \u2206v distribution that is not rejected at greater\nthan 99.9% confidence.\nIt is easy to understand why there are so few multiple\nintersections in these models by examining Fig. 3. This figure\nshows a projection of the gas discs residing within a halo of\ncircular velocity 156 km s\u22121 . The sizes of gas discs in these\nmodels are much smaller than the separation between them\nand thus multiple intersections are rare. The sizes of the gas\ndiscs in EXP1 and the KENN model are rather similar. The\ngas discs in the MMW model are generally bigger because\nthere is more cold gas in each disc and the log-normally\ndistibuted \u03bbH varies this compared to the EXP1 and KENN\nmodels. In these three models almost all the gas is above\nthe column density limit to be considered a damped system.\nIn EXP6 with more extended lower density discs we find\nsome discs where a large fraction of their area lies below the\ndamped level. More extended exponential discs than those\nconsidered here do not increase the number of DLAS coming\nfrom multiple intersections because the area dense enough\nto be above the damped limit rapidly shrinks.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the column density distribution f (N )\nfor these models in comparison with the data of StorrieLombardi & Wolfe (2000). Once again, of the four models\nonly EXP6 comes close to fitting the data.

KS probabilities for Mestel discs truncated at a column\ndensity Nt .\n\nIn the previous section we found that models in which the\nsizes of gas discs at high redshift were calculated from angular momentum conservation fail to reproduce the kinematics\nand column density distribution of observed DLAS. A model\nbased on the observations of Kennicutt (1989) for local gas\ndiscs and the results of the model of K96 also failed. We\nnoted that a common feature of these models is that the\nmajority of DLAS arise from a single galactic disc because\nof the small radial extent of these discs compared to their\nseparation. If we wish to investigate a scenario like the one\nproposed by Haehnelt et al. (1998), in which the kinematics\n\nof DLAS arise from lines of sight intersecting multiple objects, it is clear that the gaseous discs must be much larger\nin radial extent.\nUnfortunately there does not exist an alternative theoretical framework for the sizes of gas discs, especially at\nhigh redshift, so in this section we will simply develop a toy\nmodel for the distribution of cold gas. We hope that the\ninsight gained from such a toy model will lead to a more\nphysically motivated model in the future. In our toy models\nwe assume a Mestel profile and assume that the HI discs\n\n4.2\n\n7\n\n\f8\n\nAriyeh H. Maller, Jason X. Prochaska, Rachel S. Somerville and Joel R. Primack\n\nFigure 4. The distribution of column densities, log f (N ) versus\nlog(N ) for the four models of section 4.1 and the data (crosses).\nOnly the EXP6 model comes close to fitting the data. The other\nthree models produce too few DLAS, at least in the \u039bCDM cosmology we are considering. The KENN model turns over at low\ncolumn densities because log(Nt ) is often greater than 20.3 (i.e.\nwe \"run out\" of gas before reaching the cutoff column density\ndefining a DLAS).\n\nare truncated at a fixed column density, perhaps by a cosmic ionizing background. We investigate a range of values\nfor this critical column density Nt , which is the only additional free parameter of the model. We take the vertical\nscale height of the gas to be half the stellar disc scale length,\nas calculated from eqn. 7. Since the radial extent of the gas\nis now so large compared to the stars, this still results in\ngaseous discs that are quite \"thin\". We find that our results\nare only modestly dependent on the assumed vertical scale\nheight, as we show in section 5 (see also Maller et al. 2000b).\nThe distribution of \u2206v for several values of Nt between\n2 and 5 \u00d71019 cm\u22122 are shown in Fig. 5. We find that a\nvalue for the truncation column density Nt of 4 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122\n(i.e., log Nt = 19.6) gives the best fit to the kinematic data.\nThe distribution now shows a significant tail to large values\nof \u2206v, in much better agreement with the data. For values\nof Nt less than 4 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 the models produce more large\nvalues of \u2206v than are seen in the data, while higher values\nof Nt produce fewer large values of \u2206v. Fig. 6 shows the\nrelationship between the number of gaseous discs that produce a DLAS and the truncation level Nt . We see that when\n\u223c 40 percent of the DLAS come from a single gas disc we\nget the best fit to the kinematic data.\nTable 2 shows the KS probabilities for the four statistics\nof PW97. The mean-median statistic (fmm ) shows a clear\ntrend with Nt , such that the statistic improves for higher\nvalues of Nt . This is because multiple intersections can produce values of fmm between 0.8 and 1, which are not found\nin the data. These high values occur in velocity profiles of\ntwo narrow peaks separated by a large \"valley\". An example\nof this type of profile is the fourth system in Fig. 7. While\nthe statistics of PW97 show agreement between this model\nand the data, the profiles with \u2206v > 100 km/s, whose kinematics are dominated by the motions of the multiple discs\nrelative to one another, show large parts of velocity space\n\nFigure 5.

Multiple intersections tend to create DLAS with large \u2206v.\n\nFigure 6. The distribution of the number of gas discs that produce a DLAS for four values of Nt . The distribution of \u2206v is principally determined by the fraction of DLAS that are produced by\n\"multiple hits\" (lines of sight that pass through more than one\ndisc).

One clearly sees that this model will\ngive rise to many lines of sight with multiple intersections.\n\nFigure 7. Some examples of the velocity profiles of the low ions\nin DLAS produced by our modeling in Section 4.2. The dashed\nline denotes the velocity width \u2206v of the profile. The profiles\nwith \u2206v > 100 km s\u22121 have large parts of velocity space with no\nabsorbtion, something not seen in the data. It is possible that this\nis an artifact of the simplicity of our modeling.\n\nwith no absorbtion (Fig. 7). This is something which is not\nseen in the data. It is possible that such profiles arise because of the simplicity of our modeling and that in a more\nphysical scenario this configuration would not occur.\nThe gas discs have such a large radial extent in this\nmodel (see Fig. 8) that they will clearly be perturbed by\none another and not retain the simple circular symmetry\nthat we are imposing. Perhaps a model in which most of\nthe gas is in tidal streams would be more appropriate. Or\nperhaps the cold gas is not associated with the individual\ngalaxies at all, but then we must understand what keeps\nit from being ionized by the extra-galactic UV background.\nOur toy model demonstrates that the cold gas must somehow be distributed with a very large covering factor in order\nto reproduce the observed kinematics of the DLAS; understanding how it attains this distribution will require furthur\nstudy and most likely hydro simulations.\nWe now investigate the column density distribution\nf (N ) and the metal abundances for these models. Fig. 9\nshows f (N ) for the models and the data. The column density distribution is not very sensitive to the truncation density Nt , and all the models produce about the right number\nof absorbers except in the highest column density bin. This\nmay be due to our simplistic assumption that all gas discs\nare truncated at the same column density. If a small frac-\n\ntion of them were much denser it might be possible to have\nenough high column density systems without significantly\naffecting the kinematic properties of the absorbers. It should\nalso be noted that the data was tabulated assuming a q0 = 0\ncosmology, which may introduce an additional discrepancy\nin comparing to our q0 = \u22120.55 \u039bCDM cosmology. We note\nthat the shape of the distribution is fairly similar to that of\nthe data.\nWe also show the average metal abundances of our absorbers versus HI column density in Fig. 10. The observational data points are [Zn/H] measurements of DLAS with\nz > 2 (Pettini et al. 1997; Prochaska & Wolfe 1999). One\ncan see our model gives DLAS with metallicities in agreement with the data, and also reproduces the observed trend\nwith HI column density. One might expect that systems with\nhigher HI column densities should have higher metallicities\nbecause they are more likely to be in more massive halos.\nHowever, because we truncate all gas discs at the same value\nof Nt the distribution of column densities is the same for all\nhalos masses. Thus our parameterization naturally explains\nthe flat distribution of metal abundances with HI column\ndensities.\n\n5\n\nMODEL DEPENDENCIES\n\nWe have presented a model that can produce the observed\nkinematic properties of the DLAS as well as the other known\nproperties of these systems. In this section we examine the\nsensitivity of our model to some of the simplifying assumptions we have made. We examine the effect of changing the\ndisc thickness, the orbits of the satellites, the cosmological\nmodel, and the assumption of rotationally supported discs.\nWe find that none of these have a large effect on the kinematics of the DLAS in our models. Table 3 shows the KS\nprobabilities when these various assumptions are changed.\nThe effect of any of these changes is less than changing the\n\n9\n\n\f10\n\nAriyeh H. Maller, Jason X.

These models fit the two\nlower column density bins well, but falls short of the highest column density bin.\n\ntruncation density from Nt = 4\u00d71019 cm\u22122 to 5\u00d71019 cm\u22122 .\nWe conclude that our general conclusions are not sensitive\nto any of these assumptions.\n\n5.1\n\nDisc Thickness\n\nIn section 4.2 we assumed the vertical scale length of the gas\nto be one half the stellar disc scale length. Because the gas\nis so much more radially extended than the stars, this still\nresulted in very thin discs. One might think that as long\nas hz is small compared to the radial size of the discs its\nexact value would not be important. However, as explained\nin Maller et al. (2000b) very thin discs have an increased\ncross section to being nearly edge-on, which changes their\nkinematic properties. Thus the KS probabilities change nontrivially when we consider thinner discs with hz = 0.1R\u2217 . We\nfavour the model with hz = 0.5R\u2217 because these large discs\nare very likely to be warped by interactions, and Prochaska\n& Wolfe (1998) have shown that using a larger scale height\nhas an effect similar to including warps in the discs. Increasing the disc thickness to hz = R\u2217 also has a non-negligible\neffect on the kinematics because thicker discs create a larger\n\u2206v for a single disc encounter. Thus there is a trade-off, and\nwe see that we can reproduce the kinematics either with\nthinner discs with larger radial extent, or thicker discs with\nsmaller radial extent.\n\n5.2\n\nCircular Orbits\n\nWe have assumed that all the satellites are on circular orbits within the halo, which is clearly unrealistic. To test the\nimportance of this assumption we explore the opposite extreme, which is to assume that all satellites are on radial\norbits. The potential of a SIS is \u03a6(r) = Vc2 ln(r) so conservation of energy gives us\np\n\u221a\nv(r) = 2Vc ln rm /r\n(9)\n\nFigure 10. Log(Zn/H) compared to the solar value versus HI\ncolumn density. The solid line is the average value from our bestfit model and the dot-dash line shows the one sigma spread. The\ndata (triangles) is from Pettini et al. (1997); Prochaska & Wolfe\n(1999). The spread and trend with column density of the data are\nconsistent with that of our model.\n\nwhere rm is the maximum radius the satellite reaches. From\nthis one can compute that the time it takes for a satellite to\ntravel from rm to r is given by\nrm\nt(r) = \u221a\nerf(ln rm /r).\n(10)\n2Vc\n\u221a\nand that the orbital period is P = 2 2\u03c0rm /Vc . We find that\nthe expression r(t) = rm (1 \u2212 .75(4t/P )) for 0 < t < P/4 is\na reasonable fit to the true function (satellites spend less\nthan 5% of their time in the inner fourth of the orbit). We\ntherefore use it to determine the probability distribution of\nsatellites along their radial orbits. From Table 3 we see that\nassuming all radial orbits slightly improves the statistics of\nour model and thus considering a true distribution of orbits will probably only increase the agreement between the\ndata and our model, but not enough to rescue any of the\nunsuccessful models.\n\n5.3\n\nThe Initial Infall Radius of Satellites\n\nAs explained in section 3.1, when halos merge the satellite\ngalaxies are placed at a distance fmrg , in units of the virial\nradius, from the centre of the new halo. One might worry\nthat this parameter, by influencing the position of satellite\ngalaxies in the halo, may be crucial to our DLAS modeling.\nTo test this we try a model with fmrg set to 1.0 (instead\nof the 0.5 as it has been up to now). This requires us to\nchange the free parameters of the SAMs to maintain the\nnormalization of the reference galaxy, as described in SP.\nThe results of this model are shown in Table 3. Doubling this\nparameter results in only a modest change in the kinematic\nproperties of DLAS. This is because the important factor is\nthe number of galaxies in the inner part of the halo (which\nwill give rise to multiple intersections); satellites that start\ntheir infall from farther out still spend a similar amount of\ntime near the central object which explains the modest effect\non the kinematic properties.\n\n\fWhat Damped Ly-alpha Systems Tell Us About the Radial Distribution of Cold Gas at High Redshift\nModel\n\n\u2206v\n\nfmm\n\nf2pk\n\nfedg\n\nDefault Model\nhz = 0.1R\u2217\nhz = 1R\u2217\nRadial Orbits\nfmrg = 1\n\u039bCDM.5\nOCDM\nz=2\nNonrotating Discs\n\n0.57\n0.22\n0.28\n0.60\n0.36\n0.72\n0.28\n0.45\n0.35\n\n0.13\n0.12\n0.10\n0.29\n0.14\n0.10\n0.12\n0.17\n0.05\n\n0.73\n0.57\n0.30\n0.75\n0.61\n0.50\n0.66\n0.61\n0.42\n\n0.58\n0.34\n0.46\n0.66\n0.63\n0.64\n0.68\n0.67\n0.34\n\nTable 3. KS probabilities for variations of the fiducial model.\n\n5.4\n\nCosmology\n\nSo far we have only considered models set within the currently favoured \u039bCDM.3 cosmology. However, we would like\nto know how sensitive our results are to the assumed cosmology. We consider two other cosmologies, a flat universe with\n\u03a90 = 0.5 (\u039bCDM.5) and an open universe with \u03a90 = 0.3\n(OCDM.3; as in SP). The free parameters must be readjusted for each cosmology as described in SP. The KS probabilities are listed in Table 3. One sees that the effect of\nchanging the cosmological model is not a drastic one. We do\nnot show the results here, but we note that our conclusions\nconcerning the dynamical tests do not change even in a cosmology with very low \u03a90 = 0.1, nor do they change if we\nassume \u03a90 = 1. The total mass of cold gas as a function of\nredshift is rather sensitive to cosmology, however the distribution of \u2206v is almost completely insensitive to cosmology.\nThis is because the distribution of \u2206v from single hits depends only on the shape of the power spectrum, which is very\nsimilar on these scales for any CDM model. The contribution from multiple hits is determined by the dependence of\nthe merger rate on halo mass, which again is a weak function\nof cosmology.\n\n5.5\n\nNon-Rotating Gas\n\nThe final assumption we explore is seemingly a key one: that\nthe cold gas is rotationally supported in discs. We consider\na simple alternative model where the cold gas has a bulk\nvelocity with the same magnitude as the circular velocity of\nthe halo, but in a random direction. This might represent\ngas that is dominated by streaming motion or infall rather\nthan rotation. We are still able to reproduce the observed\nkinematics, because they are dominated by the motions of\nthe various sub-halos not the motions within the discs. Thus\nthe fundamental assumption that cold gas at high redshift is\nin rotationally supported discs may need to be reconsidered.\n\n6\n\nPROPERTIES OF GASEOUS DISCS IN OUR\nMODEL\n\nWe have demonstrated that the standard theories of disc formation cannot reproduce the observed properties of DLAS,\nand have proposed a rather unorthodox alternative which\nsucceeds in reproducing these observations. Here we compare our models with observations of local discs and with\nresults from recent hydrodynamical simulations to assess\n\nFigure 11. a) The distribution of RHI is plotted for gas discs\ngiving rise to DLAS at z = 3 in our fiducial model (solid) and for\nthe data of Broeils & Rhee (1997) (dashed).\n\nwhether the model is reasonable. These results are all for\nthe fiducial model of section 4.2.\nBecause local gas discs do not show a common surface\ndensity profile, it is common practice to cite their properties out to some surface density contour, often taken to be 1\nM\u2299 pc\u22122 which is equal to 1.25 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 . We will denote\nthe radius where the column density reaches this value as\nRHI . One observed local property of gas discs is that the\naverage surface density < \u03c3HI > out to this level is approximately constant with a value 3.8 \u00b1 1.1M\u2299 pc\u22122 (Broeils &\nRhee 1997). Because in our model all galaxies are normalized by the same value of Nt , the average surface density\nis identically equal to 2M\u2299 pc\u22122 . The galaxies in our model\n(at z \u223c 3) thus have an average surface density half the local\nvalue and share the property that this value is independent\nof gas mass.\nWe can also compare the sizes of gaseous discs in our\nmodels to the observations of Broeils & Rhee (1997). Fig.\n11 shows the distribution of RHI for the discs that give rise\nto DLAS in our model (at z = 3) and for the local data.\nThe local discs are about twice as large as the high-redshift\ndiscs producing the DLAS in our model. The gas discs of\nthe model however extend another factor of 3 before they\nare truncated, something which is not usually seen locally.\nNote that as these populations are selected in very different\nways, in addition to being at very different redshifts, it is not\nclear that the distributions should agree closely. However, we\nsee that the radial extent of the gas in our model is not that\ndrastically different from that in local spiral galaxies.\nLocal HI surveys find no systems with average surface\ndensities less than 5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 (Zwaan et al. 1997) which\nis attributed to photo-ionization of HI discs below a column\ndensity of a few 1019 cm\u22122 by the extra-galactic UV background (Corbelli & Salpeter 1993; Maloney 1993). Thus the\nvalue of Nt that we attain from considerations of the DLAS\nkinematics and number density is surprisingly close to local\nestimates.\nIf the gas discs in our toy model are truncated because\nof photo-ionization then we would expect the gas near the\ntruncation edge to have a high ionization fraction. However\n\n11\n\n\f12\n\nAriyeh H. Maller, Jason X. Prochaska, Rachel S. Somerville and Joel R. Primack\n\nFigure 12. The top panel shows the distribution of circular velocities of the halos that give rise to DLAS in our models. The\nbottom panel shows the average cross section to damped absorption as a function of circular velocity from our model (solid) and\naccording to Gardner et al. (1997) (dot-dash) and Haehnelt et al.\n(1999) (dashed). However, Gardner et al. (1999) finds a much\nshallower slope of 0.9.\n\nthis does not translate into DLAS with high ionization fractions because this low column density gas will only be a fraction of the gas that composes a DLAS. Most of the column\ndensity of a DLAS will come from gas at higher densities,\nas the total needs to be in excess of 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , and thus\nthe average ionization state of the gas will be low, in agreement with the observations. This model would predict that\nthe lower column density components of the velocity profile would be more likely to have higher ionization states,\nsomething that can be checked in the existing data.\nIt is also interesting to investigate the distribution of\nhalo masses giving rise to DLAS. Fig. 12 shows the distribution of circular velocities of the halos containing discs that\ngive rise to DLAS. Also shown is the average cross section\nfor DLAS as a function of circular velocity, which agrees\nfairly well with the results of Gardner et al. (1997) (slope\n= 2.94) and Haehnelt, Steinmetz & Rauch (1999) (slope =\n2.5), but not those of Gardner et al. (1999) who finds a much\nshallower slope of 0.9. Haehnelt et al. determine their average cross section by fitting to the observed \u2206v distribution\nso we expect that the relationship between the circular velocity of the halo and the \u2206v of the DLAS that arise in it\nmust be the same in our modeling and the simulations of\nHaehnelt et al. . This is in fact the case as can be seen by\ncomparing from Fig. 13 and Fig. 1 in Haehnelt et al. (1999).\nThis seems to suggest that the very different approaches of\nhydro simulations and SAMs are converging on a common\npicture for the nature of the DLAS.\n\n7\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have explored the properties of DLAS in semi-analytic\nmodels of galaxy formation. These models produce good\nagreement with many optical properties of galaxies at low\nand high redshift, and the total mass of cold gas at redshift\n\u223c 3 is also in reasonable agreement with observations. It is\ntherefore interesting to ask whether the kinematic proper-\n\nFigure 13. The relationship between the velocity width observed\nand the circular velocity of the halo in our toy model.\n\nties, metallicities, and column densities of DLAS in these\nmodels are in agreement with observations. We investigated\nthe dependences of these properties on cosmology, the distribution of satellite orbits, and gaseous disc scale height,\nand found that our results were not sensitive to these assumptions. Our results are extremely sensitive to our assumptions about the radial distribution of cold gas within\ngalactic discs. Given that one believes the other components\nof our model, one can then perhaps learn about the distribution of cold neutral gas at high redshift.\nCurrently popular theories of disc formation posit that\nthe radial size of a galactic disc is determined by the initial\nspecific angular momentum of the dark matter halo in which\nit forms, and that the cold gas traces the stellar component.\nOften, the profile of the disc is assumed to have an exponential form. We investigate several variants of such models,\nbased on ideas in the literature such as Fall & Efstathiou\n(1980), Mo et al. (1998) and Kauffmann (1996). We find\nthat the kinematics of DLAS arising in such models are in\nstrong conflict with the observations of Prochaska & Wolfe\n(1997b, 1998). This is consistent with the previous work of\nProchaska & Wolfe, in which it was shown that if the \u2206v of\neach DLAS arises from a single rotating disc, generic CDM\nmodels can be ruled out at high confidence level. Our work\nhas shown that in theories of disc formation based on angular momentum conservation, the resulting gaseous discs are\nso small that most DLAS are produced by a single disc and\nthus the models suffer from the familiar difficulties with the\nobserved kinematics. In addition, although the total mass of\ncold gas in the models is in agreement with the estimate of\n\u03a9gas from Storrie-Lombardi et al. (1996), when we use realistic cross-section-weighted column-density criteria to select\nDLAS in our models, we find that the overall number density of damped systems is too small. This again seems to\nindicate that the covering factor of the gas is too small.\nWe therefore abandon the standard picture of discs and\ninvestigate a toy model in which the gas is distributed according to a Mestel distribution with a fixed truncation radius. We adjust the truncation radius as a free parameter\nto find the best fit with the observations, and find that the\nbest-fit value is consistent with the expected ionization edge\n\n\fWhat Damped Ly-alpha Systems Tell Us About the Radial Distribution of Cold Gas at High Redshift\ndue to a cosmic ionizing background. This results in gas\ndiscs which are considerably more radially extended than\nthe standard models discussed above. For this class of models, we find good agreement with the four diagnostic statistics of PW97 which describe the kinematics; in particular,\nthe distribution of velocity widths \u2206v in the models now\nhas a tail to large \u2206v \u223c 200 \u2212 300 km s\u22121 as in the observations. In the models, the majority of these large \u2206v systems\narise from \"multiple hits\", lines of sight that pass through\nmore than one rotating disc, as in the picture proposed by\nHaehnelt et al. (1998). The column density distribution and\nmetallicities of the DLAS in the models are also in reasonable agreement with the observations.\nThis working model for DLAS has many additional implications that may be tested by observations in the near future. One interesting issue is the relationship between DLAS\nand the Lyman-break galaxies (Steidel et al. 1996; Lowenthal et al. 1997; Steidel et al. 1998), about which little is\ncurrently known observationally (Djorgovski 1997; Moller\n& Warren 1998). Previous theoretical predictions used simplifed relations to estimate luminosities (Mo et al. 1998;\nHaehnelt et al. 1999). Because the SAMs include detailed\nmodelling of star formation-related processes as well as full\nstellar population synthesis, we are in a position to make\nmuch more detailed and perhaps more reliable predictions.\nOur model suggests that 20% of DLAS contain at least one\ngalaxy with an R magnitude brighter then 25.5 in the same\ndark matter halo. The median projected distance between\nthe DLAS and the Lyman-break galaxy is about 30 kpc\n(Maller et al. 2000a).\nAnother interesting comparison is with the kinematics\nof the high ionization state elements (Wolfe & Prochaska\n2000). In the simple picture of the SAMs, these profiles\nwould naturally be associated with the gas that has been\nshock heated to the virial temperature of the halo. The hot\ngas is distributed spherically in the sub-halo, unlike the cold\ngas, which would explain why the velocity profiles of the high\nions do not trace the low ions (Prochaska & Wolfe 1997a).\nHowever, the velocity widths of the two profiles, which are\ndominated by the motions between sub-halos within the\nsame larger halo, would be related.\nThe kinematics and f (N ) distribution for absorbers below the damped limit but with column densities above the\nvalue where the disc is truncated (i.e. Lyman-limit systems)\nalso provide an interesting test of our model. Our modeling suggests that the incidence of these absorbers arising\nfrom cold discs should increase with the same slope as in\nFig. 9 and then turn over abruptly around a column density of 5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 . Below this column density these Lyman limit systems must be composed of more diffuse ionized\ngas. This is found in hydro simulations (Dav\u00e9 et al. 1999)\nand supported by some observational evidence (Prochaska\n1999). Thus observations at these column densities can directly probe whether gas discs reach the values of Nt we\nrequire to explain the DLAS kinematics and f (N ). Lastly\nit is possible to explore how the properties of the DLAS\nevolve with redshift. The merging rate is a strong function\nof redshift (Kolatt et al. 1999, 2000) so we would expect the\nnumber of \"multiple hits\" and therefore the kinematics of\nthe DLAS to be significantly different at low redshift. All\nthese issues will be explored in greater detail in subsequent\npapers.\n\nIf one is really to accept our conclusion that high\nredshift discs have an extended Mestel-type radial profile,\nclearly we must develop a theory for their origin. It is possible that the standard theory of disc formation is applicable\nat low redshift, but that some other process dominates at\nhigher redshift. For example, mergers are far more common\nat high redshift, and the gas fractions of discs are higher (cf.\nSPF). This may result in efficient transfer of orbital angular\nmomentum to the gas, producing tidal tails that distribute\nthe gas out to large radii. Locally, some interacting galaxies\nshow extremely extended rotating HI, presumably resulting\nfrom such a mechanism (Hibbard 1999). Another possibility\nis that starbursts triggered by mergers produce supernovaedriven outflows like those seen in local starbursts (Heckman\n1999) that could also result in extended gas distributions.\nWe find that a toy model in which the gas clouds have a bulk\nvelocity equal to the rotation velocity of the disc, but in a\nrandom direction (i.e. not in a rotationally supported disc)\nstill produces good agreement with the observed DLAS kinematics because the kinematics of our model are dominated\nby the motions of the multiple discs, not the kinematics\nwithin these discs.\nIt is worth noting that the surface densities of the gas\ndiscs in our model would be far below the critical value for\nstar formation determined by observations Kennicutt (1989,\n1998), implying that there may be very little star formation taking place in a 'quiescent' mode. It is interesting that\nSPF found that a picture in which quiescent star formation at high redshift is very inefficient and most of the star\nformation occurs in merger-induced bursts provides the best\nexplanation of the high redshift Lyman-break galaxies. Even\nin the extreme case in which quiescent star formation is completely switched off, we find that the starburst mode alone\ncan easily produce the observed level of star formation at\nhigh redshift. Thus in the high redshift universe interactions\nbetween galaxies seem to play a rather prominent role in determining their gas properties and star formation histories.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank George Blumenthal, James Bullock, Romeel Dav\u00e9,\nAvishai Dekel, Martin Haehnelt, Tsafrir Kolatt, Risa Wechsler, and Art Wolfe for stimulating conversations.
