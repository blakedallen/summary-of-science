Since the present method exploits the bosonic nature\nof the photons, it can be applied to any particle obeying to the Bose statistics.\nOn a technological perspective, the present protocol is expected to find applications as a novel, multi-qubit symmetrizator device to be used in modern\nquantum information networks.\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fA most relevant limitation in quantum information processing is the impossibility of\nperfectly cloning (copying) any unknown qubit |\u03c6i [1]. Even if this process is unrealizable in\nits exact form, it can be approximated optimally by the so-called universal optimal quantum\ncloning machine (UOQCM), one which exhibits the minimum possible noise for any possible\ninput state. From a theoretical perspective, two different kinds of universal cloning machines\nhave been developed so far: a deterministic N \u2192 M UOQCM based on a unitary operator\nacting on N input qubits and 2(M \u2212 N) ancilla qubits [2,3] and a probabilistic UOQCM\nbased on a symmetrization procedure involving a projective operator acting on N inputs\nand (M \u2212 N) blank ancilla qubits [4].\nIn the last years several experimental realizations of the UOQCM for polarization (\u03c0\u2212)\nencoded photon qubits have been reported. The deterministic UOQCM has been realized\nby associating the cloning effect with QED stimulated emission [5] while the probabilistic\nmachine has been realized adopting a linear symmetrization protocol [6]. Thus far, only the\nsimplest 1 \u2192 2 cloning processes, i.e. for N = 1 and M = 2, were realized by both schemes.\nIn particular, the probabilistic process was achieved by exploiting the bosonic character of\nthe photons within a linear Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer scheme [7].\nThe present work presents the first generalization of the universal optimal cloning process\nby the realization of a very general linear procedure to extend the probabilistic protocol to\nany value of N and M according to a suggestion by Werner. [4]. The validity of this\ntheoretical scheme is supported by the here reported experimental implementations of the\n1 \u2192 3 and 2 \u2192 3 probabilistic processes for \u03c0\u2212encoded photon qubits (\u03c0\u2212qubits).\nLet us outline first the N \u2192 M probabilistic cloning theory. Consider N identically\nprepared unknown qubits in the state \u03c1i = |\u03c6i h\u03c6| as input of the cloning machine while\n(M \u2212 N) blank qubits, i.e. all in the state \u03c1A = 2I , are used as an auxiliary resource. To\ngenerate M output clones the machine performs the symmetrization of the output state by\n(M )\n\napplying the projective operator, \u03a0+\n|\u03c6i h\u03c6|\u2297N N\u2192M\n\u2212\u2192\n\n1\npN \u2192M\n\nover the symmetric subspace of M qubits:\n(M )\n\n[\u03a0+ (|\u03c6i h\u03c6|\u2297N \u2297\n2\n\nI \u2297(M \u2212N ) (M )\n)\u03a0+ ]\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere pN \u2192M =\n\n1+M\n1\n2M \u2212N 1+N\n\nis the success probability of the procedure. All the identical\n\noutput clones are described by the same output density matrix \u03c3 N \u2192M = FN \u2192M |\u03c6i h\u03c6|+(1\u2212\nFN \u2192M ) \u03c6\u22a5\n\n\u03c6\u22a5 , where FN \u2192M = h\u03c6|\u03c3 N \u2192M |\u03c6i = (N +1+\u03b2)/(N +2) with \u03b2 \u2261 N/M \u2264 1 is\n\nthe \"fidelity\" of the optimal cloning process [2,3,8]. In the case of our present experiment,\nthe value of these parameters for the 1 \u2192 3 and 2 \u2192 3 machines are found respectively:\np1\u21923 = 21 , F1\u21923 = 97 , p2\u21923 = 23 , F2\u21923 =\n\n11\n.\n12\n\nIn order to implement the process expressed by Eq.1, consider that any generic 1 \u2192\nM cloning process can in facts be realized by a chain of (M \u2212 1) intermediate identical\n(M )\n\n(M )\n\n(M \u22121)\n\nmachines according to the operatorial identity: \u03a0+ =\u03a0+ (\u03a0+\n(M \u22122)\n\nI(1) )(\u03a0+\n\n(M )\n\n(M \u22121)\n\n\u2297 I(1) )=\u03a0+ (\u03a0+\n\n\u2297\n\n(2)\n\n\u2297 I(2) ) * *(\u03a0+ \u2297 I(M \u22122) ). This is justified by the very definition of the symmetric\n\nsubspace of M qubits as the smallest subspace in Hd\u2297M spanned by the tensor product vectors\n|\u03c6i\u2297M for any |\u03c6i \u2208 H2 , the qubit space with d=2. In the above expression I(i) stands for\nthe identity operator in the i\u2212qubit space, H2\u2297 i . This implies that the symmetrization of\nM qubits can be carried out step by step e.g. starting from the symmetrization of the two\ninput qubits \u03c1 and \u03c1, as shown in Fig. 1a [8]. Precisely, the state \u033a(i) realized at the output\nof any ith machine in the chain, i.e. of the overall 1 \u2192 i device, belongs to the set:\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\n(M )\n\n(M )\n\n\u033a(2) = \u03a0+ (\u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1)\u03a0+ , .. \u033a(i) = \u03a0+ (\u033a(i\u22121) \u2297 \u03c1)\u03a0+ , ..\u033a(M ) = \u03a0+ (\u033a(M \u22121) \u2297 \u03c1)\u03a0+\n(M )\n\n(M \u22121)\n\n\u03a0+ (\u03a0+\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(M \u22121)\n\n\u2297 I(1) ) * *(\u03a0+ \u2297 I(M \u22122) )[\u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1\u2297(M \u22121) ](\u03a0+ \u2297 I(M \u22122) ) * *(\u03a0+\n\n=\n(M )\n\n\u2297 I(1) )\u03a0+\n\nNote that in the above expressions the input states, i.e. the pure \u03c1 \u2261 |\u03c6i h\u03c6| and the fully\nmixed \u03c1 \u2261 2I , can be interchanged leading to the two equivalent configurations shown in\nFig.1a: the upper one has been chosen for the present implementations. These schemes\nare represented by arrays of equal Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometers, each one consisting\nof a 50/50 beam-splitter (BS) and realizing the qubit symmetrization in Hilbert spaces\nof increasing dimensions. The theory above can be easily extended to the analysis of any\ngeneral N \u2192 M cloning process. Optionally, the procedure could be made to consist of a\nsequence of linear symmetrization devices acting by inequal cloning steps, e.g. by injection\nof different mixed states along the chain.\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fThe Fig. 1b shows the experimental apparatus by which the 2-step chain (1 \u2192 3) =\n(1 \u2192 2) + (2 \u2192 3) UOQCM has been realized.\n1 \u2192 2 UOQCM. The device realizing the first step state-symmetrization was the beamsplitter BSA excited over the two input modes by the 2-qubit state: \u03c11\u21922\n= |\u03c6i h\u03c6|S \u2297\nin\n\nIA\n.\n2\n\nAfter projection by BSA in the symmetric subspace, the output state realized on the output\nmode k2 was expressed by:\n(2)\n\u03c11\u21922\n=\nout \u2261 \u033a\n\nwhere the notation\n\n\b \u22a5\n\u03c6\u03c6\n\n2\n1\n|\u03c6\u03c6i h\u03c6\u03c6| + {\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 }\n3\n3\n\n{\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 }\n\n(3)\n\nstands for a total symmetric combination of the states |\u03c6i and\n\n\u03c6\u22a5 . The identical condition realized on mode k1 was neglected, for simplicity. The two\nclones j = 1, 2 emitted over k2 were expressed by the same operators: \u03c3j1\u21922 =T rh6=j \u03c11\u21922\nout =\n5\n6\n\n|\u03c6i h\u03c6| +\n\n1\n6\n\n\u03c6\u22a5\n\n\u03c6\u22a5 .\n\nIn the experiment a pair of photons was generated by spontaneous parametric down\nconversion (SPDC) in a 1 mm thick BBO crystal, cut for Type I phase matching. The two\nphotons, each with wavelength (wl) \u03bb = 795nm and coherence time \u03c4coh \u2243 200f s, were\nemitted over two modes kA and kS respectively in the product state of horizontal (H) linear\npolarizations (\u03c0): |HiS |HiA . Then, on mode kS the qubit |HiS was \u03c0\u2212encoded by an\noptical waveplate (wp) W P\u03c6 into the generic pure-state |\u03c6iS , \u03c1S = |\u03c6i h\u03c6|S , while on mode\nkA the qubit |HiA was transformed into a fully mixed-state \u03c1A =\n\nIA\n2\n\nby a depolarizing channel\n\nrealized by a stochastically driven Electro-Optics Pockels (EOP ) cell, PA . The two qubits\n\u03c1S and \u03c1A were then drawn into a linear superposition in BSA . The exact space-time overlap\nof the two input modes implying the actual realization of the interference was controlled by\nthe microscopic BSA displacement: ZA = 2c\u2206t. Let's call \"BSA -interference\" the condition\nZA = 0 corresponding to maximum interference. By turning on the cloning machine, i.e.\nsetting it in BSA -interference, the induced Bose coalescence implied an enhancement by a\nfactor R1\u21922 = 2 of the |\u03c6\u03c6i component in the 2-qubit output state and no enhancement of\nthe {\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } component [6]. The measurement of R1\u21922 was carried out by a post-selection\ntechnique, by the \u03c0\u2212analysis setup shown at the r.h.s. of Fig.1b, connected directly to\n4\n\n\fthe output mode k2 , by disregarding at this stage the presence of BSB . This \u03c0\u2212analyzer\nconsisted of an output mode selector, realized by a 5 meter long single-mode optic fiber,\nfollowed by the wp W P\u03c6\u22121 that mapped the output state |\u03c6i into |Hi by counterbalancing the\naction of the input W P\u03c6 . Finally, by a polarizing-BS, (P BS) the |Hi and |V i components\nof the output state were directed respectively over the modes k\u03c6 and k\u03c6\u2217 . The mode k\u03c6 was\ncoupled to the detectors D1 , D2 , D3 by means of two equal 50/50 beam-splitters BS1 , BS2\nwhile the mode k\u03c6\u2217 was coupled to D1\u2217 , D2\u2217 by BS3 . The |\u03c6\u03c6i component was identified by\ndetecting coincidence by the D\u2212pair sets [D1 , D2 ] and [D1 , D3 ] while the state {\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } was\nidentified by [D1 , D1\u2217 ]. The detectors (D) were equal single-photon counters SPCM-AQR14.\n1\n\n1\n\nThree different input states |\u03c6iS = |Hi, 2\u2212 2 (|Hi+|V i), 2\u2212 2 (|Hi+i |V i), identified in the\nfollowing by |Hi , |H + V i and |H + iV i respectively, were adopted to test the universality\nof the device. The cloning process was found to affect only the |\u03c6\u03c6i component, as expected,\nand R1\u21922 was determined as the ratio between the peak value (cloning machine switched\non) and the basis value (off). The corresponding experimental values of the cloning fidelity,\nH+V\nH\nF1\u21922 = (2R1\u21922 + 1) / (2R1\u21922 + 2) were: F1\u21922\n= 0.831 \u00b1 0.001; F1\u21922\n= 0.833 \u00b1 0.002;\nH+iV\nth\nF1\u21922\n= 0.830 \u00b1 0.002. These values are to be compared with the theoretical value F1\u21922\n=\n\n5/6 \u2248 0.833 corresponding to the optimal enhancement ratio R = 2. Similar results for the\n1 \u2192 2 UOQCM have been reported in [6].\n1 \u2192 3 UOQCM. In agreement with the upper configuration shown in Fig.1a, the 50/50\nbeam-splitter BSB was the next state-symmetrization device: the whole (1 \u2192 3) UOQCM\nis shown in Fig.1b. This BS was excited over the input mode k2 by the output state\n\u03c11\u21922\nout of the1 \u2192 2 UOQCM, Eq. 3, and over the other input kB by the fully mixed state\n\u03c1B =\n\nIB\n.\n2\n\nIn analogy with the first step experiment, this state was obtained by means\n\nof a EOP , PB acting on a highly attenuated quasi single-photon beam expressed by the\n\u03c0\u2212qubit |HiB , deflected from the main laser by the mirror M, and delayed by ZB = 2c\u2206tB\nvia an \"optical trombone\". Once again, the condition ZB = 0, dubbed here as \"BSB interference\" condition, was made to correspond to the maximum overlapping of the 2\ninput modes of BSB . In particular, in no-\"BSA -interference\" condition, i.e. for |ZA | \u226b\n5\n\n\f2c\u03c4coh , the \"BSB -interference\" corresponded to the maximum overlapping in BSB of the\nmixed states \u03c1A and \u03c1B . In summary, the overall 1 \u2192 3 machine was excited by the\ninput state \u03c11\u21923\nin = |\u03c6i h\u03c6|S \u2297\n\nIA\n\u2297 I2B ,\n2\n\ni.e. by the pure state \u03c1S to be cloned and by two\n\nmutually uncorrelated mixed states \u03c1A and \u03c1B . By applying to this state the projector\n(3)\n\n\u03a0+ = |\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i h\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6| + {\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 }\n\n{\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } + {\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5 }\n\n{\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5 } + \u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5\n\n\u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5 ,\n\nthe symmetrized output state is obtained:\n(3)\n\u03c11\u21923\n=\nout \u2261 \u033a\n\n2\n3\n|\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i h\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6| + {\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 }\n6\n6\n\n{\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } +\n\n1\n{\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5 }\n6\n\n{\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5 }\n\n(4)\n\nEach one of the identical clones j = 1, 2, 3 can be thought to be expressed by the reduced den7\nsity matrix: \u03c3j1\u21923 =T rh,k6=j \u03c11\u21923\nout = 9 |\u03c6i h\u03c6| +\n\n2\n9\n\n\u03c6\u22a5\n\n\u03c6\u22a5 . The projection over the symmetric\n\nsubspace was identified by the measurement of the 3-photon Fock state over the output\nmode k3 by the \u03c0\u2212analyzer apparatus already described and shown at the r.h.s. of Fig.1b.\nThe output field emitted over k4 was negleced. The |\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i, {\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } and {\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5 } components of \u03c11\u21923\nout were measured by the 3-fold coincidence events respectively by the detector\n(D) sets [D1 , D2 , D3 ], [Dl , Dm , Dn\u2217 ] and [Dl , Dn\u2217 , Dp\u2217] for any l, m = 1, 2, 3 and n, p = 1, 2.\nA little inspection of the circuit leads to the following expectations. In the exact BSB resonance, and no-BSA -resonance, i.e. in the condition \"Bose coalescence\" of only the two\nmixed states \u03c1A and \u03c1B in BSB , an enhancement by a factor \u0393 of the |\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i and {\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5 }\ncomponents should be detected by the \u03c0\u2212analyzer. Furthermore, by turning on also the\nBSA -resonance, i.e. by setting ZA = ZB = 0, a further enhancement of the |\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i compo1\n2\nnent by a factor R1\u21923\nand of the {\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } component by a factor R1\u21923\nwere expected. In\n(3)\n\nsummary, the full resonance condition, corresponding to the swithing on of the \u03a0+ pro1\n2\njector, implied the global enhancements by the factors \u0393R1\u21923\n, R1\u21923\nand \u0393 respectively of\n\nthe components |\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i, {\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } and {\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 \u03c6\u22a5 } of the state \u03c11\u21923\nout , Eq.4. Accordingly, the\nfirst step of our strategy consisted of the measurement of \u0393. This was provided by injecting\nin the apparatus the pure state |\u03a8iSAB \u2261 |V iS |HiA |V iB , by setting ZA = ZB = 0 and by\nturning off the mixing EOP devices PA and PB . The value of \u0393 was determined by the\nratio of the counting rates of the {\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } components, the only non vanishing one under\n6\n\n\f|\u03a8iSAB excitation. These rates were measured at the peak of the detected resonance curves,\ni.e. with ZSB = 0, and far from the peak, with ZSB >> 2c\u03c4coh , being ZSB = ZA \u2212 ZB\nthe mutual delay between qubits S and B at BSB . The measured value \u0393exp =1.66\u00b10.05,\nexpressing the degree of indistinguishability attained between photons coming form different\nsources, SPDC and attenuated laser, was to be compared with the theoretical one \u0393th = 2.\n1\nBy restoring the full operation of the overall apparatus under excitiation by \u03c11\u21923\nin , R1\u21923\n2\nand R1\u21923\nwere determined as the ratios of the |\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i and {\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } component measured,\n\nvia 3-D coincidences, in resonance, i.e. ZB = ZA = 0 and out of resonance, i.e. ZB = 0,\nZA >> 2c\u03c4coh . From these measurements, the fidelity of the overall process could be deter1\n2\n1\n2\nmined: F1\u21923 = (3\u0393R1\u21923\n+ 4R1\u21923\n+ \u0393)/(3\u0393R1\u21923\n+ 6R1\u21923\n+ 3\u0393). The plots of Fig. 2a show\n\nthe experimental 3-D coincidence results measured by the \u03c0\u2212analyzer for the various state\ncomponents of the output state: \u03c11\u21923\nout . The experimental values of the fidelity measured\nby the above procedure under excitation of three different input states \u03c1S = |\u03c6i h\u03c6|S were:\nH+V\nH+iV\nH\nF1\u21923\n= 0.758 \u00b1 0.008; F1\u21923\n= 0.761 \u00b1 0.003; F1\u21923\n= 0.758 \u00b1 0.008 to be compared with\nth\nthe optimum value: F1\u21923\n= 7/9 \u2248 0.778.\n\nThe protocol can be easy generalized for any long UOQCM chain by a straightforward\nrepetition of the above procedure, as follows. The output state \u03c11\u21923\nout of the 1 \u2192 3 UOQCM\nbe injected into one input arm of a further state-symmetrizing 50/50 beam-splitter BSC\nwhile a mixed one-photon state \u03c1C =\n\nIC\n2\n\nbe injected on the other arm. This state is generated,\n\nas previously, by extracting by a further mirror M a highly attenuated beam expressed by\nthe \u03c0\u2212qubit |HiC and mixing it by an EOP , PC . This will result in a 1 \u2192 4 UOQCM\n1\u21924\napparatus generating the output state \u03c11\u21924\nout .Then again: the output state \u03c1out of the 1 \u2192 4\n\nUOQCM be injected into one input arm of a state-symmetrizing BSD while a mixed state\n\u03c1D =\n\nIC\n....and\n2\n\nso on.\n\n2 \u2192 3 UOQCM. As a significant variant of the above protocol, the PA Pockels Cell was\nremoved and the beam-splitter and BSA was excited over the input modes kA and kS by the\nsame pure states: \u033aA = \u033aS = |\u03c6i h\u03c6|. In BSA \u2212resonance condition, i.e. ZA = 0, the BSA\n7\n\n\facted as a conventional Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer emitting over the output mode k2\nto be injected, together with \u03c1B = 21 IB into the BSB\nthe symmetric Bose state |\u03c6i h\u03c6|\u22972\n2\naccording to the discussion above: Fig.1b. The input state to this novel N \u2192 M UOQCM\n\u22972\nwith N = 2 and M = 3 was then expressible as: \u03c12\u21923\nin = |\u03c6i h\u03c6|2 \u2297\n\nIB\n,\n2\n\nto be mapped onto\n\nthe 3 clone output state, according to:\n\u03c12\u21923\n\u2192 \u03c12\u21923\nin\nout =\n\n3\n1\n|\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i h\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6| + {\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 }\n4\n4\n\n{\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 }\n\nEach output clone j = 1, 2, 3 could be expressed by the state \u03c3j2\u21923 =T rh,k6=j \u03c12\u21923\nout =\n1\n12\n\n\u03c6\u22a5\n\n(5)\n11\n12\n\n|\u03c6i h\u03c6|+\n\n\u03c6\u22a5 .\n\nOnce again, the |\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i and {\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } components of \u03c12\u21923\nout were measured by the 3-D coincidence events respectively by the sets [D1 , D2 , D3 ] and [Dl , Dm , Dn\u2217 ] for any l, m=1,2,3 and\nn = 1, 2. The plots shown in Fig.2b express the experimental results. In full analogy with\nthe previous discussion, the detected bosonic coalescence was expressed by an enhancement\nof the detected coincidences by a factor R2\u21923 = 3 of the |\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i component of \u03c12\u21923\nwhereas\nin\nno enhancement affected {\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u22a5 } . Furthermore, in analogy with the 1 \u2192 2 cloning process, the experimental value of R2\u21923 was determined as the ratio between the peak resonant\nvalue for the BSB interferometer (ZB = 0) and the out of resonance value: ZB >> 2c\u03c4 . The\nuniversality condition was assessed by injecting the same three different input test states\nH\nadopted for the previuos cases. The experimental values of fidelity were found : F2\u21923\n=\nH+V\nH+iV\n0.895 \u00b1 0.003; F2\u21923\n= 0.893 \u00b1 0.003; F2\u21923\n= 0.894 \u00b1 0.003 in correspondence with the\n\ninput states defined above. Tese values are be compared with the calculated optimal value:\nth\nF2\u21923\n= (3R2\u21923 + 2) / (3R2\u21923 + 3)= (11/12) \u2248 0.917. In all previous experiment, the mea-\n\nsured values of R2\u21923 were reduced by the unwanted injection of two and three photons in\nthe mode kB and by simultaneous emissions of two pairs from SPDC. These spurious events\naffected the measured value of the R2\u21923 factor by a calculated average amount of \u2248 15%.\nIn summary a very general and efficient linear multi-step optical procedure for the probabilistic N \u2192 M optimal universal cloning machine has been proposed together with the\nsuccessful experimental realization of of the first two steps, i.e. the (1 \u2192 3) UOQCM. Fur8\n\n\fthermore, the probabilistic (2 \u2192 3) UOQCM, was also demonstrated by a straightforward\nvariant of the same protocol. This shows that a very similar protocol can be adopted to\nimplement contextually the N \u2192 M UOQCM, the N \u2192 (M \u2212 N) Universal NOT gate\nand any programmable anti-unitary map [9] following the very general symmetrization procedure recently proposed by [10]. Since the present method basically exploits the bosonic\nnature of the photons, it can be straightforwardly applied to any particle obeying to the\nBose statistics. On a more sophisticated technological perspective, the present protocol is\nexpected to find applications as a realization of a general, multi-qubit device based on the\nstate-symmetrization process to be used in modern Quantum Information networks.
