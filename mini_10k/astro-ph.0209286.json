KILIC, D.E. WINGET, T. VON HIPPEL AND D.F. LESTER\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin, Astronomy Department, 1\nUniversity Station, C1400, Austin, TX 78712, USA\nAND\nD. SAUMON\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory, MS-D413, Los Alamos, NM\n87544 USA\n\nThe existence of carbon in cool He white dwarf (WD) atmospheres has\nbeen known for a relatively long time[5]. The presence of carbon in these\natmospheres is explained by convective dredge up of interior carbon [6].\nPelletier et al. (1986) presented the first detailed calculations of this process\nand showed that carbon diffuses upwards from the core into the base of the\nHe-rich envelope where it can be dredged up by a surface convection zone.\nAs the temperature of the star decreases, more carbon diffuses upward, and\nthe base of convection zone moves deeper into the star, further enriching the\nsurface layers with carbon [2]. The diffusion time scales of C and O do not\ndiffer by large amounts, and are found to be essentially the same for some\nmodels [3] . We expect all non-interacting WDs with 0.45 < Mwd /M\u2299 < 1.1\nto have C/O cores. Since there is oxygen in these cores, there is a priori\nno reason to prevent the dredge up of oxygen as well as that of carbon.\nThis paper reports new infrared spectroscopic observations of DQ WDs\nsearching for oxygen and describes model atmospheres for these stars.\nThe WDs chosen for observations were those already known to display the carbon swan bands in their optical spectra and have temperatures\nbetween 6000 and 9000K. Our sample is selected from DQs that do not\nshow any abnormalities in their infrared photometry [1]. We have obtained\ninfrared spectroscopy of five WDs at McDonald Observatory in December 2001 using the 2.7m Harlan-Smith Telescope and Rokcam attached to\nCoolspec. Throughout the observations, a narrow band CO filter (2.2732.311 \u03bcm) was utilized in order to decrease the background noise. Figure\n1a presents the observed spectra of our sample of WDs.\n\n\f2\n40\n\nWD2140+207\n\n30\n\nWD0435-088\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n20\n\nWD0341+182\n\n0.4\n\n10\nWD0706+377\n0.2\nWD0946+534\n\n0\n2.285\n\n0\n2.29\n\n2.295\n\n2.3\n\n2.305\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nFigure 1. a) Observed spectra of DQ WDs b)Effect of CO on pure-He atmosphere models\n(log g=8, Tef f =8000, 7000, 6000K (from top to bottom) with three different C/O compositions).\n\nThe atmospheric C/O ratio depends in great part on the C/O ratio\nat the surface of the WDs' C/O core. This remains uncertain in as much\nas the C12 (\u03b1, \u03b3)16 O reaction rate is not well known in the astrophysically\nimportant and relevant temperature\u2212density domain. Models of C and O\ndiffusion and dredge up in cool He-rich WDs [2] indicate a maximum photospheric abundance of log n(O)/n(He) = -4.0 to -5.3 for different core\ncompositions. The most abundant O-bearing molecule is CO, and it has a\nstrong band head at 2.3\u03bcm. Our synthetic spectra calculations for He WDs\nwith different temperatures and different C-O abundances are presented in\nFig 1b. The CO abundance is based on a simplified chemical equilibrium\ncalculation that includes CO, C2 , C, and O. It appears that CO should be\neasy to detect for the coolest DQs. This is because at low Tef f the ionization of He is decreased, which reduces the background continuum opacity.\nObserved spectra of WDs (Fig 1a) show that we might have detected\nCO in WD2140+207 and WD0435-088. There is also evidence for weak\nfeatures in the spectra of the other three WDs, but it is impossible to derive\nthe oxygen abundances from these low SNR spectra. Additional follow-up\nspectroscopy will be obtained in Nov 2002 using the NASA IRTF and Spex.\nThis work has been supported by NSF grant AST-9876730 and NASA\nNAG5-9321.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nBergeron, P., Leggett, S.K., & Ruiz, M.T., 2001, ApJSS, 133, 413\nMacDonald, J., Hernanz, M., and Jose, J., 1998, MNRAS , 296, 523\nPaquette, C., Pelletier, C., Fontaine, G., & Michaud, G., 1986, ApJSS, 61, 197\nPelletier, C., Fontaine, G., Wesemael, F., & Michaud, G., 1986, ApJ, 307, 242\nWegner, G., and Yackovich, F.H., 1984, ApJ, 284, 257\nWeidemann, V., & Koester, D., 1995, A&A, 297, 216\n\n\f"}
