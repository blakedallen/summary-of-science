Its system parameters are listed\nin Table 1 together with those for the hypothetical companion of Ribas, Font-Ribera & Beaulieu (2008). Here m and R\nare the mass and radius of the body (Deming et al 2007), a\nis the semimajor axis, e is the orbital eccentricity, \u03c9, \u03a9 and\ni are the argument of periastron, longitude of the ascending\nnode and inclination respectively, the latter two measured\nrelative to the line of sight, M is the mean anomaly, Q is\nthe Q-value, k is the Love number and Rg is the radius of\ngyration. All angles are in degrees; round brackets refer to\nthe hypothetical orbital data used by Ribas et al. (2008),\nwhile square brackets refer to initial data used in the simulation presented here (see Section 3.1). Note that the mass\nand radius of GJ 436b are respectively 1.35 and 1.094 times\nthose of Neptune. As an extremely short-period system with\na significant eccentricity, it has attracted considerable attention because it would appear that such a system should\nlong ago have circularized. However, there is one factor in\n\nparticular which works against the intuition that GJ 436b\nought to be circularized, and that is that the planet's distance from the star in units of its radius is quite large at\n160 compared to, for example, HD 209458b at 76. Since\nthe circularization timescale depends on the fifth power of\nthis ratio, it turns out to be relatively long if one uses estimates for the Q-value of Neptune. The latter has been\nestimated by Banfield & Murray (1992) to be in the range\n1.2 \u00d7 104 < QN < 3.3 \u00d7 105 , while Tittemore & Wisdom\n(1989) estimate the Q-value of Uranus, whose mass is 0.85\ntimes that of Neptune, to be less than 3.9 \u00d7 104 .

Being estimated to lie in the range 1-10 Gyr, the age of the\nsystem is quite uncertain (Torres 2007). Thus in order for\nthe non-zero eccentricity to be simply a result of a circularization time which is longer than the age of the system,\nthis simple analysis suggests that Qb must be greater than\n2.3 \u00d7 105 (\u03c4age /Gyr), where \u03c4age is the age of the system.\nIn this Letter we focus on the proposal of Ribas et al.\n(2008) that, given the circularization timescale is considerably less than the age of the system, the eccentricity is\nsustained by the presence of a low-mass companion planet\npositioned at the location of the outer 2:1 resonance, in an\n\u25e6\norbit which is inclined at around 10 to that of GJ 436b. The\nauthors claim to have found a strong peak at 5.2 days in a periodogram analysis of the RV data, consistent with a body in\nthe 2:1 resonance and with a false alarm probability of 20%.\nThis is supported by a fit to the residuals of the two-body fit\nto the inner orbit. Moreover, the authors claim that harbouring a planet in the 2:1 resonance allowed them to produce\nthe observed eccentricity of GJ 436b with a planet whose\nmass is low enough not to have previously been detected in\nthe RV data.2 Their scenario was further strengthened by\nthe fact that it provides a natural explanation for the apparent change in the inclination to the line of sight of the orbit\nof GJ 436b, ib , which would bring it into transit between the\ntime of the null result of Butler et al (2004) and the positive detection of Gillon et al (2007). The authors estimated\n\u25e6\nthat a rate of change of ib of around 0.1 yr\u22121 was needed to\nbe consistent with these observations (note that this generally includes a combination of nutation and precession of the\norbital plane). However, Alonso et al (2008) have more recently reported an upper limit for the current rate of change\nof ib of 0.03 \u00b1 0.05o yr\u22121 . Since 0 < dib /dt < 0.03o yr\u22121 for\nabout 20% of the precession cycle (see Figure 4(c)), this in\nitself does not rule out a Ribas et al-type system.\nIn the following section we briefly consider the tidal\nevolution of a single-planet system, putting a more accurate lower bound on Qb for that case. In Section 3 we study\nthe proposed orbital solution of Ribas et al. (2008) using a\ndirect integration scheme for three bodies which includes\nperturbing accelerations due to tidal dissipation and spinorbit coupling in both the star and the innermost planet,\nand the post-Newtonian relativistic contribution to the potential of the star (Mardling & Lin 2002). We demonstrate\nthat long-term evolution tends towards the doubly-circular\nstate, independent of the tidal circularization timescale of\nthe outer planet, with the orbits inclined to each other by\n\n2\n\nNote that we find a maximum value of only 0.1 for eb over\na modulation cycle using their initial conditions, independent of\ninitial phases and longitudes.\n\n\u03c9\n343\n[343]\n(265)\n\n\u03a9\n\n[90]\n[30]\n\ni\n86.54\n[86.54]\n(96.54)\n\nM\n\n(0)\n(107.6)\n\nQ\n\nk\n\nRg /R\n\n[105 ]\n\n[0.028]\n\n[0.276]\n\n?\n-\n\n[0.346]\n-\n\n[0.511]\n-\n\nFigure 1.

Section 4 discusses stability while Section 5\npresents a conclusion.\n\n2\n\nGJ 436B WITHOUT A COMPANION\n\nThe simplest explanation for the significant orbital eccentricity of GJ 436b is that the circularization timescale is\nlonger than the age of the system. Figure 1 shows the results of integrating the secular equations (Mardling & Lin\n2002) for a single synchronized planet backwards and forwards in time, with system parameters taken from Table 1\nand Qb = 105 (solid curves). The equations used are based\non the analyses of Hut (1981) and Eggleton, Kiseleva & Hut\n(1998) in which a constant time lag is assumed for the\ntidal bulge, and are correct for any eccentricity (in as far\nas the constant time lag assumption is correct). If one assumes that no forces other than those included in the simulation were acting in the past, and also that the Q-values of\nthe planet and star as well as their radii have not changed,\nthese results suggest that the system cannot be older than\n0.38(Qp /105 ) Gyr. This is in contrast to the results obtained\nif one integrates equations which are correct to second-order\nonly in the eccentricity (dashed curves). The latter approximation is clearly adequate for estimating the current circularization timescale, but is entirely inadequate for understanding the past evolution. In particular, the second-order\nanalysis does not allow an upper bound estimate of the age\nof the system. While alternative tidal models such as those\nwhich assume constant lag angles for all tidal components\n\n\fTidal evolution of GJ 436b\n(Goldreich & Soter 1966), or those which include the dynamical tide for high eccentricity (Mardling 1995) may produce slightly different functional dependence on the eccentricity were the analysis to be carried out, they are not likely\nto change the estimated age of the system by much.\nOther forces are likely to have been operating early in\nthe life of the system, including those due to the rapid rotation of the star, larger stellar and planetary radii, the presence of a protoplanetary disk, coupling of the stellar and\nplanetary magnetic fields (Laine, Lin & Dong 2008), and\ndifferent Q-values. Such factors will have determined the\n\"initial\" orbital state of the system, that is, the state of the\nsystem when such influences became negligible, and it seems\nlikely that the eccentricity would not have been much larger\nthan its present value if the single-planet scenario is correct.\nThe main conclusion one can draw from this simple\nanalysis is that if GJ 436b does not have companions capable of sustaining the observed eccentricity, the upper bound\non its age in terms of Qb puts a lower bound on the Qvalue of GJ 436b of Qb > 3 \u00d7 105 (\u03c4age /Gyr), a value slightly\nhigher than that gleaned from equation 1. In particular, it\nis approximately equal to the upper bound for the Q-value\nof Neptune if the system is as young as 1 Gyr, and an order\nof magnitude larger if it is as old as 10 Gyr.\n\n3\n\nLONG-TERM TIDAL EVOLUTION OF\nTWO-PLANET SYSTEMS\n\nThe second simplest explanation for a non-zero eccentricity in a system like GJ 436 is the presence of a companion\nplanet or star. In general the induced eccentricity of a stable\nsystem will vary quasi-periodically, with periods of variation\ndominated by the rate of change of the angle between the apsidal lines, the rate of change of the resonance angle(s) if the\nsystem is in a resonance, and the rate of change of the argument of periastron if the system is significantly non-coplanar\n(Murray & Dermott 2000). The amplitude of variation depends on the ratios of semimajor axes and planet masses\nas well as the initial eccentricities and the angle between\nthe apsidal lines, and when relativistic effects are important, on the ratio of the inner planet mass to the stellar\nmass. Formulae for the amplitude and period of variation\nof the eccentricities are given in Mardling (2007) for coplanar non-resonant systems with moderate inner eccentricity\n< 0.2). The expression for the amplitude is also accu(eb \u223c\nrate for moderately non-coplanar and/or resonant systems,\nwhile that for the modulation period severely overestimates\nthe true value for a system in or near the 2:1 resonance\nbecause for such a close system, higher order and resonant\nterms should be included.\nA mistake often made is that secular variations of the\norbital elements persist for the lifetime of the system, even\nwhen dissipative forces are significant (eg. Maness et al.\n2007). In fact such variations are damped out after a few\ncircularization timescales, with the system evolving to a\npseudo-equilibrium configuration which itself evolves on a\ngenerally longer timescale. A secular theory for two-planet\ncoplanar systems with dissipation has recently been developed (Mardling 2007), in which it is shown that the eccentricity of the innermost planet together with the angle\nbetween the apsidal lines, \u03b7, evolve towards a fixed point in\n\n3\n\n(eq)\n\neb > 0.15\nno solutions\n\nall solutions unstable\n(eq)\n\neb = 0.15\n\n(eq)\n\nFigure 2.

Note that this timescale\nis independent of the Q-value of the outmost planet. When\nresonant terms are important and/or the system is moderately inclined, the behaviour is only slightly modified (as\nlong as the system is stable). The fixed point or equilibrium\neccentricity, a quantity which is independent of the initial\nvalues of eb , phases and longitudes, is given by\n(eq)\n\neb\n\n(5/4)(ab /ac ) ec \u03b5\u22122\nc\n\n=\n1\u2212\n\np\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n3\nab /ac (mb /mc )\u03b5\u22121\nc + \u03b3\u03b5c\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b5c = 1 \u2212 e2c and \u03b3 = 4(nb ab /c)2 (m\u2217 /mc )(ac /ab )3 ,\nwith nb the mean motion of the inner planet and c the speed\nof light.3 Note, however, that (2) was derived assuming that\nthe average value of the outer eccentricity doesn't vary much\non the circularization timescale. When it does (as happens\nfor the hypothetical GJ 436 system because the outer mass\nis so low), the estimate (2) tends to overestimate the equilibrium eccentricity. Thus (2) can be regarded as an upper\n(eq)\nbound for eb .\n\n3.1\n\nGJ 436b with a resonant companion\n\nIf the circularization timescale of GJ 436b is less than a third\nof the age of the system, it will already have reached and\nevolved past the equilibrium eccentricity. Thus we begin by\ncalculating the range of companion masses and eccentricities\ncapable of producing an equilibrium eccentricity of 0.15, that\nis, the observed eccentricity of GJ 436b. As in the previous\nSection, this will allow us to put a lower bound on its Qvalue. Using this value in (2) as well as a period ratio of\n2, we can rearrange the equation to write mc as a function\nof ec . The result is plotted in Figure 2 which shows that\nno solutions exist for ec < 0.18. Solutions corresponding to\n> 0.18 are actually unstable (see next section) so that in\nec \u223c\nfact no systems exist for which the equilibrium eccentricity\nis equal to the observed eccentricity. (In fact, the equilibrium\n\n3 The quantity \u03b3 is the ratio of the relativistic to the threebody contribution to the rate of apsidal advance of the innermost\nplanet.\n\n\f4\n\nRosemary A. Mardling\n\neccentricity corresponding to the hypothetical companion of\nRibas et al. (2008) (with ec = 0.2) is 0.06.)\nOne can conclude from this that if GJ 436b does have\na single nearby low-mass companion in or near the 2:1 resonance, the system cannot yet have evolved to its pseudoequilibrium state. Its circularization timescale must therefore be longer than one third of the age of the system,\nthereby providing the weaker constraint on the Q-value of\nGJ 436b than in the single-planet case that Qb > 7.7 \u00d7\n104 (tage /Gyr). In fact, we can do better than this, and argue that after only one circularization timescale the system\nwill be in apsidal libration with zero minimum eb and a maximum which depends on ec (Mardling 2007). From stability\nconsiderations ec can't be much more than around 0.3 (given\nit needs to be able to move safely through the resonance as\nit tidally evolves; see Figure 5). Since this corresponds to a\nmaximum value of eb in a libration cycle of 0.12, we must\nhave that \u03c4circ > \u03c4age , putting the same lower bound on Qb\nas in the single-planet case.\nWe finish this section by demonstrating the behaviour\ndiscussed above. Using the data in Table 1, we performed\na direct integration using the code described in the Introduction (Mardling & Lin 2002). The star's Q-value is an estimate, while the Love numbers k (twice the apsidal motion constant) and radii of gyration Rg for the star and\nplanet correspond to n = 3 and n = 1 polytropes respectively (Sterne 1941), the latter often taken to approximate\nthe structure of Jupiter. The spin period of the star was\ntaken to be 20 days while the spin of the planet was taken\nto be synchronous with the orbital motion. Both were taken\nto be aligned with the orbit normal.\nThe secular analysis in Mardling (2007) demonstrates\nthat varying the Q-value of the inner-most planet merely\nchanges the timescale on which the system evolves towards\nthe final state while not affecting the local secular oscillation period. Since tidal dissipation in the planet dominates the tidal evolution while the inner orbit's eccentricity\nis non-zero, we took Qb = 0.1 in order to show the detail\nof various stages of evolution, and confirmed that the evolutionary timescale scales linearly with Qb for Qb = 1 and\n10. We also confirmed that the system remains stable for\n2 \u00d7 105 yr with Qb = 106 , consistent with the results of\nSection 3.2. Figure 3 shows 4000 years of evolution, equivalent to 4 (Qb /105 ) Gyr for general Qb , except that Qb /0.1 as\nmany secular oscillations will have occurred in that time. It\npasses through its present (hypothetical) configuration after\n1600(Qb /0.1) yr. Panel (a) shows the evolution of eb (bottom curve) and ec , with the system entering resonance at\naround 200(Qb /0.1) yr, and entering apsidal libration (panel\n(b)) when eb (temporarily) hits zero at 1000(Qb /0.1) yr. The\nlatter occurs on a timescale of 1 \u03c4circ after which the system\nevolves towards the quasi-equilibrium phase on a timescale\nof 2 \u03c4circ . The subsequent approach of both eccentricities to\nzero is well approximated by the secular theory and occurs\non a timescale of around 6 \u03c4circ in this case (equation (60)\nMardling 2007). Panel (c) shows the approach to a fixed\n\u25e6\nvalue of around 10.3 of the relative inclination.\nFigure 4 shows detail of the passage through resonance.\nWhile the amplitude of variation of the eccentricity is only\nslightly enhanced (so that estimates provided by the secular\ntheory are reasonably accurate), the amplitude of variation\nof the orbital period ratio Pc /Pb suddenly increases as the\n\nec\n\napproximate\nstart of quasi\u2212equilm\nphase\n\nFigure 3. Approach to the doubly circular state of a resonant\ntwo-planet GJ 436 system. See text for discussion.\n\nFigure 4. Detail of the resonant phase of Figure 3.

The corresponding variation of\nthe orbital period of GJ 436b is around 15 mins, a significant\nincrease on the variation outside the resonance, whose effect\non the transit timing would be easily measured (note that\nthe libration period for this system is around 200 days). For\n\n\fTidal evolution of GJ 436b\n\n5\n\nprocedure described in Mardling (2008). Initial conditions\ncorresonding to unstable systems are indicated in the figure\nby red dots; stable systems are left blank. A clearly defined\nboundary is evident, indicating that a system with a sufficiently low initial value of ec would be free to tidally evolve\nthrough the 2:1 resonance without the danger of instability.\nOther resonances are also evident, for example, the 3:2 and\nthe 5:2.\n\n4\n\nFigure 5. A stability map of the region surrounding the 2:1 resonance for a range of values of ec .\n\ncoplanar systems in the 2:1 resonance with mb , mc \u226a m\u2217 ,\nthis variation is given by (Mardling, in preparation)\n\u03b4Pb /Pb\n\n=\n\u2243\n\n2 1 + (mb /mc )\u03c3 2/3\n\n\u0002\n\n\u22122/3\n\n2\n\n(mc /mb ) \u03b4\u03c3,\n\n\u0003\u22121\n\n\u03b4\u03c3/\u03c3\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c3 = Po /Pi , \u03b4\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2212 2, that is, the \"distance\" from\nresonance, and the approximation holds for mc \u226a mb .4\nHowever, the GJ 436 system passes through the resonance\nin around 300(Qb /0.1) yr = 0.3(Qb /105 ) Gyr so unless Qb is\nat least equal to the upper estimate of Neptune's Q-value,\nwe would not expect to see the system in resonance now\n(given that it was deposited into the resonance around the\ntime of formation). Alonso et al (2008) find no obvious departure from linear ephemeris and conclude that the proposed resonant solution of Ribas et al. (2008) is unlikely.\nOnce the system leaves the resonance, the amplitude of variation \u221a\nof Pb is given by (3) with \u03b4\u03c3 replaced by the quantity\n\u03b4\u03c3 \u2212 \u03b4\u03c3 2 \u2212 \u2206\u03c3 2 , where \u2206\u03c3 is the width of the resonance\n(Mardling, in preparation). \u03b4Pb reduces quickly as the system crosses the resonance, however, even when the system\nbecomes doubly circularized \u03b4Pb is still significant at around\none minute. Thus we conclude that even out of resonance,\nthe companion planet proposed by Ribas et al. (2008) would\nbe detectable through transit timing variations given current\naccuracies (Alonso et al 2008).\nPanel (c) shows the variation of the inclination of\nGJ 436b to the line of sight, ib . The resonance has very\nlittle effect on the period and amplitude of variation, with\nthe average rate of change of ib equal to approximately\n\u25e6\n0.06 yr\u22121 . This compares to the observational upper bound\n\u25e6\nof 0.03 \u00b1 0.05 yr\u22121 by Alonso et al (2008).\n3.2\n\nStability\n\nFigure 5 shows a stability map for a system composed of\nGJ 436b and a companion planet with a mass of 4.7M\u2295 ,\n\u25e6\naligned periastra, a mutual inclination of 10 , and with initial companion eccentricity ec and period Pc = \u03c3Pb indicated by the position in the plot. Three-body integrations\nwere performed, with stability being determined using the\n4\n\nSee also Holman & Murray (2005) and Agol et al (2005) but\nnote that our expression is independent of the eccentricities, and\nis an approximation to an expression valid for any masses.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe main conclusion from this study is that with or without a single nearby companion planet, in or out of the 2:1\nresonance, the Q-value of GJ 436b must be greater than the\nupper bound estimate for Neptune if the age of the system\nis around 1 Gyr, and up to an order of magnitude greater\nfor an age of up to 10 Gyr. Passage through resonance of\na Ribas et al. two-planet system occurs on a timescale of\n0.3(Qb /105 ) Gyr, remaining stable throughout and beyond.\nHowever, even it were now no longer in resonance, the companion planet should still be detectable through transit timing variations.\n\nREFERENCES\nAgol E., Steffen J., Sari R., Clarkson W., 2005, MNRAS,\n359, 567\nAlonso R., Barbieri M., Rabus M., Deeg H.
