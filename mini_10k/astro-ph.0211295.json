Turnshek\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\ndbn@phyast.pitt.edu\n\nAbstract\n\n1.\n\nWe detail a powerful indirect method for the study of damped Ly\u03b1 systems (DLAs) at low redshift. We increase the probability of finding a\nlow-redshift DLA to nearly 50% by targeting QSOs that are known to\nhave strong low-redshift MgII and FeII absorption lines in their spectra.\nWe are using Sloan Digital Sky Survey QSO spectra complemented by\na survey we are conducting at the MMT to study the metal-line systems. The Hubble Space Telescope is being used to confirm low-redshift\nDLAs. In addition, we are imaging low-redshift DLA galaxies with several ground-based telescopes to directly study their environments.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDamped Ly\u03b1 systems (DLAs), QSO absorption line systems with column densities N (HI) \u2265 2 \u00d7 1020 atoms cm\u22122 , contain less than 10% of\nthe baryons in the universe. However, since over 95% of the neutral gas\ncontent of the universe resides in DLAs, they are extremely important for\nthe study of galaxy formation and evolution. In particular, low-redshift\nDLAs provide a unique opportunity to study the gaseous and luminous\ncomponents of galaxies simultaneously.\nIn order to fully understand the evolution of the neutral gas component, one needs to know how much of it exists and where it exists at\nevery epoch. In the absence of selection effects which recent observations suggest are not important (Ellison et al. 2001), the answer to the\nformer can be found in the statistics of DLAs. The whereabouts of this\nneutral gas relative to starlight can be studied if the DLA galaxies can\nbe identified. Eventually we hope to understand the evolution of DLAs\nconsistently with other studies of galaxy evolution such as the star formation history of the universe, the evolution of galaxy number counts,\nand simulations of structure formation and evolution.\n\n1\n\n\f2\nThere are, however, difficulties inherent to the study of DLAs. Specifically, imaging DLAs is difficult at high redshift (z > 1.65) where the\nLy\u03b1 transition is observed in the optical and the statistics are better\nunderstood, while the statistics are poor at low redshift where imaging studies are more practical. Only \u2248 30 low-redshift DLA absorbers\nare known from UV spectroscopic surveys in comparison to the over 100\nhigh-redshift ones found in optical spectroscopic surveys. Thus, the lowredshift DLA number density, and hence \u03a9DLA , the cosmological neutral\ngas mass density in DLAs, are poorly known (see Figure 1). Given that\nthe look-back time associated with redshift 1.65 is \u2248 70% of the age of\nthe universe, this is a serious limitation.\nDLA galaxies are sometimes elusive even at low redshift (Steidel et\nal. 1997, Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2001). Since only a handful of low-redshift DLA\ngalaxies have been identified (Le Brun et al. 1997 and Nestor et al.\n2001 describe most of them), a detailed study of DLA environments is\nnot yet possible. In this contribution we describe our efforts to increase\nthe sample of low-redshift DLAs, addressing both the how much and the\nwhere of neutral gas in the universe, as well as some recent results.\n\n2.\n\nDLAs and Low-Ionization Metal Line Systems\n\nRao & Turnshek (2000, hereafter RT2000) uncovered an empirical\nrelation between the strengths of the MgII\u03bb2796 and FeII\u03bb2600 absorption lines and the occurrence of DLAs (Figure 2). They found that\n\nFigure 1 The log of \u03a9DLA vs. redshift. The two low-redshift (z < 1.65)\ndata points are from Rao et al. (2002, in preparation). These include\naddition data obtained after the publication of RT2000.\n\n\fDLAs @ Low-z.\n\n3\n\nnearly 50% of systems with W0\u03bb2796 > 0.5 \u00c5 and W0\u03bb2600 > 0.5 \u00c5 were\nDLAs, and the rest were subDLAs with 1019 \u2264 N (HI) < 2 \u00d7 1020\natoms cm\u22122 . This discovery has two implications for low-z DLA work.\nFirst, targeted surveys for DLAs in QSO spectra with known strong\nlow-ionization metal line absorption systems will have a much greater\nsuccess rate. Second, these metal lines appear in the optical down to\nmuch lower redshift (for a spectrograph with coverage down to 3200\u00c5,\nfor example, FeII\u03bb2600 can be found down to z = 0.23 and MgII\u03bb2796\nto z = 0.14.) Because of the relative ease of acquiring optical QSO spectra, dn/dz for these systems is much better known, thus allowing us to\n\"bootstrap\" from dn/dz for the metal-line systems to that of DLAs. We\nare undertaking targeted surveys with HST to discover z < 1.65 DLAs\nin known strong low-ionization metal line absorption systems. The goals\nare to provide new systems at low enough redshift for imaging, to better determine the statistical properties of DLAs including dn/dz, \u03a9DLA ,\nand their column-density distribution, f (N ), at z < 1.65 as well as to\nto better understand the relationship between FeII absorption, MgII absorption, and the properties of the Ly\u03b1 line associated with them.\nAn observationally ideal sample for discovering DLAs would include\nbright QSOs with strong intervening metal-line absorption systems at\nredshifts close to that of the QSO. A low value of zem \u2212 zabs reduces\na chance occurrence of an intervening Lyman limit system that might\n\nFigure 2 W0\u03bb2796 vs. W0\u03bb2600 for low-redshift systems with Ly\u03b1 information.

Nearly 50% of systems in the\nupper right quadrant are DLAs.\n\n\f4\nresult in the absence of continuum flux at the expected wavelength of\nthe DLA line. Thus, the first step is to find large samples of low-redshift\nmetal-line systems from which homogeneous subsets with specific selection criteria can be constructed. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nis an excellent resource for this as it provides over 3800 optical QSO\nspectra in the Early Data Release (EDR, June 2001) alone.\n\n3.\n\nMetal-Line Statistics from the SDSS\n\nWe have constructed an unbiased sample of 640 absorption line systems with W0\u03bb2796 > 1.0 \u00c5 from the SDSS EDR. The task of analyzing\nseveral thousand spectra requires automation and good spectral analysis\nalgorithms. We used our own continuum-fitting and line-finding routines\nand interactively confirmed or rejected each candidate absorption system. We also checked for blending and the quality of the continuum fit.\nInitial tests suggest that the 1.0 \u00c5 sample is complete, and analysis of\nthe sample with W0\u03bb2796 > 0.5 \u00c5 is in progress. Statistical results of the\n1.0 \u00c5 sample are discussed in Nestor et al. (these proceedings). We find\nthat there is evidence for mild evolution with redshift for both dn/dz,\nespecially at z < 0.6, and in the slope of the log W0\u03bb2796 distribution.\nThe metal-line dn/dz results from the SDSS will greatly reduce the\nstatistical errors in the calculation of the DLA dn/dz and \u03a9DLA for\nz > 0.4. Currently, \u224850% of the error in dn/dz for the DLAs comes\nfrom the error in dn/dz for the MgII systems. We are also conducting\na large survey for MgII and FeII absorption at the MMT which will\neventually permit improved estimates of \u03a9DLA down to z = 0.14.\n\n4.\n\nDLA Galaxies\n\nThe \u2248 14 low-redshift DLA galaxies that have been imaged thus far\nreveal a mix of morphologies ranging from compact dwarf galaxies to\nlarge spirals (Le Brun et al. 1997, Steidel et al. 1995, Turnshek et al.\n2001, Nestor et al. 2001). There also appear to be a higher fraction of\nlow surface brightness galaxies among the DLA galaxies in comparison\nto the general field. Here, we present imaging results on two of the DLA\nfields. For details see Rao et al. (2002).\nFigure 3 shows UBRK images of the PKS 1629+120 field that has\na DLA at z = 0.532. The only resolved object within 10\u2032\u2032 of the QSO\nis a spiral galaxy (labeled G1) with an impact parameter of \u2248 17 kpc.\nAlthough the galaxy redshift has not been spectroscopically confirmed, it\nwould be \u2248 L\u2217 at z = zabs . Spectral evolution synthesis model fits to the\nphotometry suggest that if the galaxy was at z = 0.532 it would consist\nof a young stellar population with some dust reddening in addition to\n\n\fDLAs @ Low-z.\n\n5\n\nFigure 3 UBRK images of the PKS 1629+120 field (zDLA = 0.532.)\nNorth is up and East is left. The QSO PSF has been subtracted and its\nposition marked with a \"+\". G1 is identified as the DLA galaxy.\n\nFigure 4 Smoothed BRJK images of the PKS 0952+179 field (zDLA =\n0.239.) North is up and East is left. The QSO PSF has been subtracted\nand the residuals masked out. See text for details.\n\n\f6\nan underlying older population. The UBRK morphologies in Figure 3\nare consistent with this interpretation. This sightline also has a subDLA\nsystem at z = 0.901. G1 would be an unusually luminous, \u2248 4L\u2217 , galaxy\nat this redshift and is therefore unlikely to be the z = 0.901 galaxy.\nThe PKS 0952+179 field (zDLA = 0.239) shown in Figure 4 is quite\ndifferent. Faint disk-like structures, labeled 1 and 2, can be seen to the\nimmediate east and southwest of the QSO sightline in the J-band image,\nwhich has the best seeing and QSO PSF subtraction of the four. They\nspan \u2248 25 kpc. PSF subtraction of the light from the QSO leaves residuals that are \u2248 0.02L\u2217 at z = 0.239. Several additional features within\nthis 20\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032\u2032 field are visible in at least 2 of the images. The relatively\nbright object in the K-band image to the west of the QSO sightline,\n#7, has colors that classify it as an extremely red object (ERO). If it\nis related to the z = 0.239 DLA galaxy it would be the lowest redshift\nERO known. The conclusion would be that it is a starbursting region\nwith very strong dust extinction (AV >\n\u223c 4.8).\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nThrough both indirect and direct methods, we are making progress\nin the attempt to understand the low-redshift DLA population. The\nSDSS and our own MMT survey spectra are enabling us to determine\nthe statistical properties of low-redshift MgII and FeII absorption systems, which can be used to track high N (HI) systems at z < 1.65 to\na high degree of accuracy. With our ongoing HST surveys we are finding new low-redshift DLAs, improving the low-redshift DLA statistics,\nand improving our understanding of the empirical relation between lowionization metal-line systems and DLAs. In addition, we are directly\nstudying the DLA environment with an active imaging campaign.\n\nReferences\nBouch\u00e9, N. et al. 2001, ApJ, 550, 585\nEllison, S.
