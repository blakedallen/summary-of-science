In the\nrecent past, however, new directions in these fields have\nbeen explored. A long term goal is to build many-body\nquantum models constructed of interacting photons. The\nidea is that these systems can simulate many-body models appearing in fields such as condensed matter theory [3]. By now, several proposals of such cavity/circuit\nQED quantum simulators have been put forward, among\nothers; Mott insulator\u2013superfluid phase transitions [4],\nspin-models and fractional quantum Hall states [5], the\nanomalous Hall effect [6], relativistic effects [7], nonAbelian models [8], the Jahn-Teller effect [9], and the\nphotonic Josephson effect [10, 11]. The desired nonlinearity, and thereby photon-photon interaction, plays\nan important role in all of these and is established via\ninteraction between light and matter. In the simplest example of matter-light interaction, the Jaynes-Cummings\nmodel (JC) [12, 13], the interaction is inherently nonlinear giving rise to the effective scattering between photons. This far, for the JC model the most striking outings\nof the non-linearity are the collapse-revival [14] and the\nphoton blockade effects [15].\nExperimentally, quantum simulators involving many-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: jolarson@fysik.su.se\n\nbody systems are mainly to be found within ultracold atomic gases, either trapped dilute fermi or bose\ngases [16] or more strongly correlated lattice or low dimensional models [17]. These systems provide an extreme controllability of system parameters as well as being well isolated from their environments and hence possessing long coherence times. Together with the experimental achievements within this area, topics such as decoherence and thermalization in systems processing many\ndegrees-of-freedom have gained extra attention recently.\n\n\u03c1 (0)\ntot\n\nU(\u03c4)\nUnitary map\n\n\u03c1 (\u03c4)\ntot\n\nTr\n\nTr\n\nB\n\nB\n\n\u03c1 (0)\nA\n\nL[\u03c1 ,\u03c4]\nA\n\nDynamical map\n\n\u03c1 (\u03c4)\nA\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic picture of the subsystem dynamics. The\nfull A + B system evolves unitary under the map U (\u03c4 ). Tracing over subsystem B gives the state \u03c1A (\u03c4 ) of subsystem A at\nthe initial (t = 0) and final (t = \u03c4 ) times. The dynamical map\nL[\u03c1A , \u03c4 ] relates these two states of subsystem A. The evolution of \u03c1A (\u03c4 ) described by the dynamical map is in general\nnot unitary, and even if \u03c1A (0) is pure the propagated state\n\u03c1A (\u03c4 ) does not need to be pure.\n\nFor completely isolated systems, it is understood that a\ntrue thermalization of the full system cannot occur for an\n\n\f2\ninitial pure state. Nevertheless, expectation values h\u00c2n i,\nwhere \u00c2n is any operator that operates in the subspace\nspanned by particle/subsystem n, often display charac(n)\nteristics as if the state \u03c1mic of this particle/subsystem is\na microcanonical one [18]. Dividing the full system into\ntwo subsystems A and B, a sketch of the dynamics is\ngiven in Fig. 1. For more details see [19, 20]. The full\nsystem state \u03c1(0) evolves unitarily in time under some\noperator \u00db (\u03c4 ). Tracing out the degrees of freedom of\nsubsystem B at time t = 0 or t = \u03c4 gives the initial\nand final states for subsystem A, \u03c1A (0) and \u03c1A (\u03c4 ). The\nstate \u03c1A (0) is related to the state \u03c1A (\u03c4 ) via a dynamical map [19, 20]. When the evolution of subsystem A\nis Markovian, the dynamical map L[\u03c1A , \u03c4 ] forms a semigroup [19, 20]. The dynamics of subsystem A is in general\nnot unitary. Moreover, when B contains a large number\nof degrees-of-freedom, any information in A is likely to be\ndistributed over the many degrees-of-freedom of B, and\n\u03c1A (\u03c4 ) then becomes approximately diagonal in its computational basis. Regardless whether \u03c1A (\u03c4 ) approaches\na microcanonical state or some other diagonal state, system B has a decohering effect on A. If B is a closed\nfinite system, we call this decohrence as inherent, while\nif the decoherence derives from coupling to an infinite\nreservoir we call it external. A general believe is that\nfor closed quantum systems, chaos and non-integrability\nis deeply connected to thermalization, and thereby integrable many-body systems may not thermalize or even\nresult in quasi diagonal states \u03c1A (\u03c4 ) [21]. In such systems, recurrences of the coherence of system A often occurs, i.e. the information in system A, once lost to B, is\nrecovered in A at certain revival times.\nFor the photonic many-body systems mentioned above,\nrelatively little has been investigated in terms of inherent\ndecoherence and thermalization. On the contrary, external decoherence and thermalization induced by a surrounding reservoir have been studied in great detail for\ncavity/circuit QED models [19, 22]. There are, however,\nsome exceptions, both theoretical and experimental. In\nhis seminal work [23], J. Gea-Banacloche explained how\ninherent decoherence may cause peculiar effects in cavity QED systems. Considering the JC model with the\nfield initially in a coherent state with a large amplitude,\nit was shown how the qubit disentangle from the field at\nhalf the revival time, regardless of the initial state of the\nqubit [23]. In the qubit subspace, the evolution is clearly\nnon-unitary since the overlap/angle between any two initial qubit states is not preserved. A physical picture of\nthis phenomenon is given in [24]. In a couple of experiments performed by the ENS group in Paris, loss of qubit\ncoherence due to interaction with a microwave cavity field\nwas demonstrated [25]. A similar idea was later applied\nin circuit QED, and the qubit dephasing deriving from\nmeasurement backaction was studied [26]. In the present\nwork we analyze a plethora of decoherence phenomena,\nboth inherent and external, in a bimodal cavity/circuit\nQED system. Decoherence originating from; non-unitary\nsubsystem evolution, irreversible coupling to surrounding\n\nenvironments, as well as irreversible coupling to a measurement device are discussed.\nIn particular, a two-level system (qubit) induces an effective coupling between two quantized photon modes.\nIn the dispersive regime, as is studied here, the qubit\nmediated tunneling between the two boson modes shows\nmuch resemblance with a bosonic Josephson junction,\nappearing for example in Bose-Einstein condensates in\ndouble-well potentials [27, 28] or via coupling of atomic\nZeeman levels in a spinor condensate [29]. The photonic\ncounterpart of the Josephson effect has currently been\nconsidered in either coupled cavity systems (where the\nnon-linearity is of a JC photon blockade type) [10] or\nin optomechanical cavity systems (where non-linearity\ninstead stems from a mechanical photon blockade effect) [11]. Unlike Refs. [10, 11], the Josephson effect\nstudied in this work is intrinsic and not as in earlier publications where the effect is extrinsic and the Josephson\ncurrent appears in real space. Moreover, the qubit in\nour scheme brings out both the boson tunneling as well\nas the non-linearity. In this respect, our model shares\nmore similarities with the recent works of Ref. [30]. The\nmodels of [30] are, however, both linear. Studying the\nlinear entropy or the qubit Bloch vector, we find that\ninherent decoherence shows a Gaussian decay signaling\nnon-Markovianity. The non-linearity causes a collapserevival pattern in the Josephson oscillations, similar to\nthe collapse-revivals found in the JC model [12]. In contrast, the linear entropy of the qubit shows a much richer\ncollapse-revival structure containing a series of well established fractional revivals. Measuring the qubit state,\nand especially the Bloch vector amplitude, provides direct information about the Josephson dynamics. However, the qubit dephasing resulting from non-demolition\nqubit measurement causes an exponential decay in the\noscillations. For non-selective qubit measurements, the\nJosephson current can be considerably slowed down via\nthe quantum Zeno effect. Somewhat surprising, for a\ndissipating cavity, the scaled Josephson current does not\ndecay exponentially, but rather Gaussian and it is found\nthat for realistic system parameters around 10 full oscillations survive. The bimodal JC model is integrable\nand thermalization is not to be expected. Including the\ncounter rotating terms, i.e. going beyond the rotating\nwave approximation, we consider a weaker sort of thermalization related to the analysis of [31]. Despite the\nclose similarity with the generic model of Ref. [31], we do\nnot encounter thermalization. We further evidence the\nabsence of thermalization by consider long-time state averages as was recently proposed in [32]. Neither in this\nsense does our system thermalize.\nThe paper continues as follows. In the next section, the\nmodel system is introduced and the photonic Josephson\neffect demonstrated. In the linear regime we present an\nanalytical approximation giving a deeper understanding\nof the effect. Section III proceeds by considering the evolution of the qubit subsystem. Since the full system is so\nfar assumed closed, the field and the qubit subsystems ex-\n\n\f3\nhibits the same type of reduced evolution. Gaussian decay together with periodic recurrences of the coherence\nis found. Effects deriving from non-demolition or nonselective qubit measurements are addressed in Sec. IV,\nwhile the following Sec. V considers the more complete\npicture where the cavity has been coupled to a zero temperature photon bath. In Sec. VI, the prospects of a\nweak kind of thermalization is analyzed. Finally, concluding remarks are presented in Sec. VII.\nII. INTRINSIC PHOTONIC JOSEPHSON\nEFFECT IN A BIMODAL RESONATOR\n\nWe consider a two-level system, either an atom/ion interacting with an optical Fabry-Perot cavity or a superconducting qubit embedded in a transmission line resonator. We will call the two-level system a qubit and\ndescribe it using the Pauli matrices [\u03c3\u0302z , \u03c3\u0302 \u00b1 ] = \u00b12\u03c3\u0302 \u00b1\nand \u03c3\u0302z |\u00b1i = \u00b1|\u00b1i, where |\u00b1i are the two internal qubit\nstates. The energy difference between the two qubit\nstates is h\u0304\u03a9. The resonator supports two quantized\nmodes, quasi-resonant with the qubit transition. We will\ntake the two modes as degenerate with frequency \u03c9c , but\npoint out that the degeneracy is not crucial and could in\nprinciple be lifted.

The\ntotal number of photons, N\u0302 \u2261 n\u0302a + n\u0302b , is conserved and\nthe dynamics depends solely on U .\nWith the Hamiltonian \u01240 of Eq.

This is the analog of intrinsic bosonic Josephson oscillations for photons. In the earlier works on the\nphotonic Josephson effect [10, 11] photons tunneled between spatially separated regions, while here they tunnel\nbetween two orthogonal cavity modes. To make things\nmore transparent, lets assume the a-mode to be initially\nin a coherent state with amplitude \u03b1, \u00e2|\u03b1i = \u03b1|\u03b1i, the\nb-mode in vacuum, and\u221athe qubit in the superposition\nstate |\u03c6i = (|+i + |\u2212i)/ 2, i.e.\n1\n|\u03a8(0)i = |\u03b1, 0i \u221a (|+i + |\u2212i) .\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\f4\npropagated state return back in phase a revival of the\nJosephson oscillations occurs. For revivals to be possible, the spectrum should be discrete and quasi-linear,\ni.e. the non-linearity cannot become to strong. In the\nlanguage of cavity QED, revivals is a direct proof of the\nquantized nature of the electromagnetic field [37], while a\ncollapse could, in principle, derive from any fluctuations.\nWe conclude from the fact that our system is governed by\nJC dynamics, a self-trapping effect should not be found,\nwhile collapse-revivals are expected.\n\nZ(t)\n\n(a) 1\n\n\u22121\n0\n0.5\n\nP(t)\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\nZ(t)\n\n(c)\n\n50000\n\n1/6\n\n100000\n\n2/3\n\n1/4 1/3\n\n5/6\n3/4\n1/1\n\n1/2\n50000\n\n0\n0\n1\n\n100000\n\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nt\nFIG. 2: Time evolution of the scaled photon inversion Z(t)\n(a) and (c), and linear entropy (b) for the Hamiltonian (2).\nAs an initial state we have a coherent state with amplitude\n\u03b1 = 4 in the a-mode,\nvacuum in the b-mode, and the qubit\n\u221a\nin (|+i + |\u2212i)/ 2. Due to the non-linearity of the JC model,\na clear collapse-revival pattern emerges. The linear entropy\ndisplays a more pronounced collapse-revival pattern than the\ninversion. The dimensionless parameters are g = 1, \u2206 = 50,\n\u03b4 = 1, and \u03b7 = 0.1.\n\nIn the interaction picture, the time evolved state reads\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 h\n|\u03a8(t)i = \u221a |\u03b1 e\u2212i2Ut \u2212 1 /2, \u03b1 e\u2212i2Ut + 1 /2i|+i\n2\ni\n\u0001\n\u0001\n+|\u03b1 ei2Ut \u2212 1 /2, \u03b1 ei2Ut + 1 /2i|\u2212i ,\n(9)\nand for the scaled photon inversion defined as\nZ(t) \u2261\n\nhn\u0302a i \u2212 hn\u0302b i\nhn\u0302a i + hn\u0302b i\n\n(10)\n\nwe have Z(t) = cos(2U t). This result is an ideal case\nwhere losses and non-linear contributions have been ignored. In the next sections we will discuss the influences\nof dissipation and decoherence, while we now consider\nthe consequences of the non-linearity.\nTypically, non-linearity plays an important role in\nJosephson dynamics. In the bosonic Josephson junction, it gives rise to effects like self-trapping [27, 28] and\ncollapse-revivals [34, 35]. Self-trapping appears since the\nnon-linearity can be seen as inducing effective shifts in\nthe two mode frequencies and when these are out of resonance the population swapping is hindered. A collapse\nin the oscillations derives from the fact that the nonlinearity disturbs the equividistant energy spectrum of\nthe linear model (7) and this in turn leads to a destructive interference effect in the dynamics [36]. If at some\nlater time tr , the evolving eigenphases contained in the\n\nThe result for the scaled photon inversion Z(t), obtained from numerically solving the driven two-mode JC\nmodel (2), is presented in Fig. 2. We truncate the Hilbert\nspace such that Tr[\u03c1(t)] \u2248 1, with \u03c1(t) the full density\noperator. In (a) we give the inversion for long times,\nwhile in (c) we display the short time behavior. The fast\noscillating fluctuations in Z(t) seen in (c) derives from\nthe non-zero driving (\u03b7 6= 0). The long time dynamics\nexhibits a typical collapse-revival structure as found in\nthe JC model [12, 13, 38]. However, in the present bimodal model the collapse-revival structure is much more\ncomplex compared to the regular JC model. In order to\ndemonstrate this we introduce the linear entropy of the\nfield or the qubit [39]\n\nPf,q (t) = 1 \u2212 Tr[\u03c12f,q (t)],\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c1f,q = Trq,f [\u03c1] is the reduced density operator of\nthe field \"f \" or the qubit \"q\" and \u03c1 is the full system's\ndensity operator. Linear entropy is a measure of purity of the state \u03c1f,q , with Pf,q = 0 representing the pure\nstate, and for the special case of a qubit maximum mixedness gives Pq = 1/2. Whenever the evolution is unitary\nand the initial state is pure one has Pf (t) = Pq (t) [40].\nTherefore, we do not need to distinguish between the\ntwo subsystem's linear entropies in this case. For the\nabove example, we plot in Fig. 2 (b) the corresponding\nlinear entropy. This time the collapse-revival structure\nis much more complex, indicating that rich dynamics is\noccurring even within the collapse region indicated by\n(a). The revival-peaks are marked according to standard\nconventions [36]. In a collapse region, the phase-space\ndistributions are smeared out over the whole accessible\npart of the phase-space [41]. At the 1/2 peak the distribution reforms, however 180 degrees out of phase from\nits initial position, while at the 1/1 revival it reforms\nat its original location [41]. The remaining fractional\nrevivals represent partial restoration of the phase space\ndistributions, which then form several localized blobs in\nphase space and not single ones as is the case for the 1/2\nand the 1/1 revivals [41]. Increasing the non-linearity,\ni.e. increasing the fraction g/\u2206, results in shorter revival\nperiods but also in less pronounced revivals.\n\n\f5\n\nDecoherence of a quantum system is seen as loss of information, which is only possible by coupling the system\nto some other system. If the additional system contains\na large number of degrees-of-freedom, the information\ncan be shared in many ways and it takes a long time\nto restore the information in the initial system. If the\nnumber of degrees-of-freedom goes to infinity and the\nvarious coupling strengths varies, we expect the information to be forever lost. When we neglect any backaction of the reservoir onto the system we say that the\nevolution of our system is Markovian [19]. Markovian\ndynamics is described by irreversible evolution (i.e. nonunitary), typically leading to exponential loss rates. As\nthe reservoir size is finite or for very structured reservoirs, non-Markovian effects may become important giving rise to recurrences of information, and moreover to\nnon-exponential decay [19]. In particular, for short times\na Markovian decay is linear in time while non-Markovian\ndecay is typically quadratic. In this section we will discuss the inherent decoherence effects the cavity fields induces on the qubit.\nIn some recent publications, Sokolovski and co-workers\nconsidered a quibit coupled to a bosonic Josephson junction [30]. A Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in a\ndouble-well potential is analyzed. The qubit couples to\nthe barrier separating the two wells, and in this respect\nits internal state controls the tunneling rate between the\ncondensates. As such, they introduced the name \"quantum gatekeeper model\" for this setup. At first, the condensate was seen as a reservoir for the qubit, and the inherent decoherence of the qubit was studied. The qubit\nas a measuring device for the bosonic Josephson oscillations was then analyzed. In many aspects, the current system shows great resemblance with the gatekeeper\nmodel. There are some crucial differences though; the\nbosonic modes in our model induces coupling between the\nqubit levels, i.e. our model is intrinsically non-linear, and\nthe photon tunneling is present for both internal qubit\nstates. In principle, as demonstrated in the previous section, transitions within the qubit can be neglected by\nconsidering the limit of large detuning. Moreover, by including a second qubit residing all the time in its lower\nstate |\u2212i but still couple identically to the boson modes\nas the first qubit, it is possible to construct an identical\ngatekeeper model as in [30]. We, however, will keep only\na single qubit and allow for qubit transitions and thereby\nfor non-linear effects.\nThroughout this work, the two qubit states |\u00b1i are\nassumed meta-stable such that dissipation and decoherence can be neglected. In this section we further take\nany cavity losses to be zero within the time-scale of the\nexperiment. Cavity losses and its effects will be investigated in Sec. VI. Our initial state will be taken to have\nthe form (8).\nThe time evolution in the dispersive linear regime is\n\n(a) 0.5\nP(t)\n\nFIELD INDUCED DECOHERENCE OF THE\nQUBIT\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n(b) 0.5\nP(t)\n\nIII.\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nt\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Comparison of the linear entropy as\nobtained from the analytical approximate result (14) or from\nnumerical diagonalizition of the Hamiltonian (2) (analytic approximation (green lines) and numerical (black curves)).

In this linear approximate model, at t = \u03c0/2U ,\nthe coherence is fully recovered. For unitary evolution\nwith initial pure states, the linear entropy is a good\nmeasure of entanglement, and we therefore see that the\ntwo fields quickly become entangled with the qubit. For\nlarge field amplitudes |\u03b1|, the two subsystems stays almost completely entangled until they fully disentangle at\ntj = \u03c0/2U . Thus, the qubit rapidly loses information\n(coherence) to the two boson modes, but since the system is finite the information is restored periodically in\ntime. Once the information is completely transfered to\nthe two modes, the qubit is maximally entangled with the\ncavity fields. Note that the disentanglement occurs when\nthe photonic Josephson junction has performed half an\noscillation, i.e. when the initial coherent state in mode a\nhas been transfered to mode b.\nThe above analytical model is an idealized case where\nwe completely disregarded non-linearities. In Fig. 3, we\n\n\f6\ntherefor compare the analytical results with results obtained from a full numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. As for Fig. 3, the non-zero pumping induces small\nrapid oscillations. In the upper plot (a), the parameters\nare the same as in Fig. 2 and we find that the analytic\napproximations captures well the overall structures. The\noscillations deriving from the pumping is naturally not\nseen in the analytic results. In the lower plot (b) we\ndecrease the detuning \u2206 in order to increase the nonlinearity, and as expected the two results begin to disagree. Figure 3 gives dynamics at the time-scale of the\nJosephson oscillations, while in the previous section we\nstudied evolution on the scale of collapse-revivals.

In\nFig. 4 we present the numerical results of \u0398(t) compared\nto the integration of |R(t)| of Eq. (16). The parameters and initial conditions are the same as for Fig. 3 (a).\nFrom the figure it is clear that even in the collapse regions, the two subsystems (fields and qubit) are not fully\nentangled, which would be reflected in a Bloch vector\nof zero length. The analytic results (green curve) still\ncaptures the general structure of the numerical results\n(black curve). As a conclusion, by measuring |R(t)|, and\nthereby \u0398(t), the number of Josephson oscillations performed by the cavity fields is obtained. Measuring the\nqubit dipole movements h\u03c3\u0302x i and h\u03c3\u0302y i is easily obtained\nby detecting the qubit population inversion after a \u03c0/2\npulse has been applied to the qubit [1]. Any measurement on the qubit will however induce a perturbance,\nwhether it is in the qubit population or in its coherence.\nWhile such effects were disregarded from the analysis of\nRef [30], we address them in the next section.\nIV. QUBIT MEASUREMENT INDUCED\nDECOHERENC OF THE JOSEPHSON EFFECT\n\nIn the \"gatekeeper model\" of [30], the qubit was suggested as a quantum \"meter\" measuring the Josephson\noscillations of the Bose-Einstein condensate. In that\nmodel, if the qubit occupies its upper state |+i Josephson oscillations took place, while if the qubit resided in\nits lower state |\u2212i oscillations were blocked. Thereby,\nby measuring the effective amount of time the qubit has\nspent in the state |+i one knows for how long the oscillations (\"the gate\") has been turned on (\"open\"). The\nsituation is different in our case since Josephson oscillations are independent of whether the qubit is in |+i\nor |\u2212i. This, however, does not imply that the qubit\ndoes not carry any information about the oscillations.\nIn a Bloch picture, since h\u03c3\u0302z i \u2248 0 the Bloch vector\nR(t) \u2261 (h\u03c3\u0302x i, h\u03c3\u0302y i, h\u03c3\u0302z i) revolve mainly along the equator of the Bloch sphere. Thereby, in our system it should\nbe more practical to measure h\u03c3\u0302x i or h\u03c3\u0302y i instead of h\u03c3\u0302z i.\nAnother possibility is to measure the length of the Bloch\n\nIn its original idea [42], the Josephson effect is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon describing a current across\nthe bulk of two attached superconductors. A common\nquantum coherence among the constituent electrons is\nthe crucial aspect for a non-zero current. At the meanfield level, the relative phase between the two superconductors are directly coupled to the inversion Z(t) [27].\nThe question in our system then raises how a qubit measurement will affect the Josephson oscillations. For example, we note that since the Stark-shifts of the qubit\nstates |\u00b1i depends on the photon number, the backaction noise from measuring the relative phase between\nthe qubit states should manifest itself in the phase coherence of the cavity fields. Apart from dephasing, more\ndrastic outcomes may appear when the measurement is\nprojective. Most well known is the Zeno slowing down\ncaused by repeatedly reprojecting the system state. In\nthis section, we will analyze both the case of pure dephasing and Zeno slowing down.\n\n\f7\nA.\n\nMeasurement induced dephasing\n\nA qubit measurement relying on for example ionization is, of course, destructive. Once measured, the qubit\nis \"destroyed\". The idea of a quantum non-demolition\n(QND) measurement is that repeated measurements can\nbe performed on one and the same system, all yielding\nthe same outcome. Let us take a physical quantity characterized by some operator \u00c2, then if \u00c2 commutes with\nthe system Hamiltonian and the measurement of \u00c2 does\nnot induce any back-action noise on \u00c2, a second measurement of \u00c2 will reveal the same value as the first measurement [43]. Even though the measurement does not have\nany back-action effect on \u00c2, according to quantum mechanics it will induce noise in the conjugate variable of\n\u00c2. In cavity QED, in order to measure the photon number of the quantized cavity mode, QND measurements\nhas been thoroughly analyzed both theoretically [44] and\nexperimentally [45]. Similar QND measurements have\nbeen carried out also in circuit QED [46]. Our goal is\nnot, however, to measure the number of photons contained in the resonator, but to measure the state of the\nqubit. For superconducting qubits, such QND measurements have recently been demonstrated [47]. The picture\nwe have in mind is that the the qubit level-population\nis detected non-destructively, i.e. measuring \u03c3\u0302z . Since\nneither \u03c3\u0302x nor \u03c3\u0302y commutes with \u03c3\u0302z , the measurement\ninduces a qubit dephasing [48]. In the bosonic Josephson junction, decoherence has been shown to suppress\nthe oscillations [35, 49]. For Bose-Einstein condensates\nin double-well potentials, the loss of coherence (phase\ndiffusion) is mainly due to atom-atom interactions [50].\nThe dephasing we consider in this section has a different\nnature as it affects the anchilla system and not the boson\nmodes directly.\n\nZ(t)\n\n(a)\n\n|R(t)|\n\n(b)\n\n1\n0\n\u22121\n1\n\n\u2202\u03c1(t)\n= \u2212i[\u03c1(t), \u0124RW A ]\n\u2202t\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\nt\nFIG. 5: (Color online) The scaled photonic inversion Z(t)\nof Eq.

Letting \u03b3 = 0 we find identical evolution\nas in Figs. 2 and 3. Once \u03b3 6= 0, the off-diagonal terms\n\u03c1\u2212+ and \u03c1+\u2212 of the atomic density operator will typically\nshow an exponential decay [19].\nWe solve the master equation (17) by simple Newton integration, valid to order O(dt2 ) in the time-step\ndt. However, in its simplest form, the first part describing regular Hamiltonian dynamics becomes non-unitary\nand the method is greatly unstable. Therefore, the first\nunitary evolution is taken into account in all orders of\ndt, while the irreversible evolution is performed to order\nO(dt2 ). As long as dt is small this should be justified,\nand to be fully sure we have verified convergence of our\nresults by varying dt.\nIn Fig. 5, the photonic inversion (a) together with the\nBloch vector amplitude (b) are displayed. It is seen that\nthe Josephson oscillations decay exponential, indicating\nthat the noise induced by the qubit measurement propagates to the fields and thereby demolish the macroscopic\ncoherence needed for the oscillations. As pointed out in\nthe introduction, this exponential decay signals an irreversible loss of coherence. The Bloch vector amplitude\nshows an interplay between the non-Markovian inherent\ndecoherence resulting from coupling to the two cavity\nmodes and Markovian external decoherence due to the\nqubit measurements. The exponential decay rate is set\nby \u03b3, and in the most simple approximation we get\n|R(t)| = e\u2212|\u03b1|\n\n0.5\n0\n0\n\nWe assume this QND measurement to be an irreversible process that can be modeled by a master equation [19], i.e. the measurement is continuous and far from\na traditional von Neumann measurement. As no dissipation occurs, we write down the equation-of-motion for\nthe full density operator as\n\n2\n\nsin2 (2Ut)\u2212\u03b3t\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nFrom Fig. 5 (b) we note that the analytical approximation (18) (green curve) slightly overestimates the exponential decay. A large \u03b3 implies that information about\nthe qubit, and thereby the boson modes, is rapidly leaked\nfrom the system to the \"observer/meter\". If the measurement is perfect, i.e. a complete knowledge of the\nsystem is obtained, all the coherence shared between the\ntwo subsystems gets lost, and the qubit disentangles from\nthe two modes. There is hence a trade-off between the\ninformation subtracted and the survival of the Josephson oscillations. We note that using the qubit as a meter\nwas recently utilized in a circuit scheme measuring the\nquantum state of a mechanical (rather than an optical)\nresonator [51].\n\n\f8\nB.\n\nQuantum Zeno effect\n\n\u03c1(t) \u2192 \u03c1f (t)\u03c1q (t).\n\n(19)\n\nIn between measurements,\n\u0010\n\u0011 the system evolves unitarily\nas \u00db\u03c4 = exp \u2212i\u0124RW A \u03c4 . Since the measurements are\ntaken to be instantaneous, the full evolution operator\nbecomes\nik\nh\n(20)\n\u00db (t, \u03c4 ) = M\u0302 \u00db\u03c4 ,\nwhere M\u0302 is the field-qubit disentanglement operator\ncharacterizing the measurement, and k is the largest integer such that 0 \u2264 t \u2212 k\u03c4 \u2264 1. If \u03c4 is small, the coherent\nbuild up of the field is frequently interrupted and we expect a slow and linear field increase.\nThe predicted linear rise of the field amplitude is numerically demonstrated in Fig. 6 for various values of \u03c4 .\nFor no measurements, \u03c4 = \u221e, the field grows quadratically from time t = 0. When \u03c4 is decreased we find a\nregime of linear growth which passes over into a quadratic\nregime. The smaller \u03c4 , the smaller is the incline and the\nmore inhibited is the quadratic evolution. The figure is\na typical example of a Zeno slowing down [53, 55].\n\nb\n\n\u3008n \u3009\n\n0.4\n\nRepeatedly measuring a system affects the effective\nevolution of the system. The extreme situation of freezing the evolution by constantly projecting the system\nstate back onto its initial state is the idea behind the\nquantum Zeno effect [52]. In reality, no measurement is\nexpected to be instantaneous resulting in a \"dead-time\"\nafter each measurement. In this respect an ideal Zeno\neffect is unlikely [52]. This, however, does not prevent\na slowing down effect, which was recently demonstrated\nwithin cavity QED [53]. We briefly discussed the evolution of a cavity mode under coherent external pumping.\nFor an empty mode, the field growth is initially quadratic\nin time. Under a Zeno slowing down, this becomes linear\nin time [53]. A quadratic growth hinges on coherently\nadding up the injected field, while repeated QND measurements destroys the field phase. The injected field can\nthen be seen as making a random walk in phase space and\nthereby the linear growth. We will not consider the field\nbuild up due to external pumping, but instead consider\nthe growth of the initially empty cavity mode deriving\nfrom photon tunneling between the two modes. We have\nseen that such growth is as well quadratic for small times\nt. In order to separate it from external pumping we pick\n\u03b7 = 0.\nThe approach of the previous subsection is not capable of describing a Zeno slowing down since we pictured\na constant loss of information, and not repeated phase\ndisturbances. We will therefore instead assume repeated\nnon-selective qubit measurements [54]. At times tn = n\u03c4\n(n = 1, 2, ...) the qubit population is measured but the\nresult is not recorded. The correlations between the fields\nand the qubit is taken to be fully demolished by the measurement, hence\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nt\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Evolution of the field intensity hn\u0302b i under repeated non-selective qubit measurements. The different\ncurves correspond to different measurement frequencies; red\ncurve \u03c4 = \u221e, green curve \u03c4 = 1/100, blue curve \u03c4 = 1/500,\npink curve \u03c4 = 1/1000, and black curve \u03c4 = 1/1500. The\ndimensionless parameters are, g = 1, \u2206 = 50, \u03b4 = 1, \u03b7 = 0,\nand \u03b1 = 2.\n\nFor a composite system A + B, it has been demonstrated that repeated projective measurements on subsystem A render a purification of subsystem B [56].\nLetting the \u03c1(0) = \u03c1A (0)\u03c1B (0), with \u03c1A (0) =\n|\u03c8A (0)ih\u03c8A (0)|, be the initial state, the projective measurements divides the unitary evolution at tn = n\u03c4\n(n = 1, 2, ...) according to\n\u03c1(t) \u2192 \u03c1B (t)|\u03c8A (0)ih\u03c8A (0)|.\n\n(21)\n\nIn the case of non-selective measurements a disentanglement between the two subsystems appears, while for projective measurements in addition to disentanglement the\nA system is as well reset to its initial state. Regardless of\nthe initial state \u03c1B (0), the effective evolution will translate into a pure state. This is the idea behind measurement controlled evolution [56, 57]. In the present system,\nwe have verified that this mechanism indeed works. Various initial states like coherent and thermal field states\nhave been considered, and in every case the purity of the\nfield subsystem approaches unity after sufficiently many\nprojective qubit measurements. The specific purified field\nstate differs between various initial field states. In certain situations the fields approach Fock states, but this\nseems not to be a generic feature.\n\nV.\n\nRESERVOIR INDUCED DECOHERENCE\n\nSo far we have considered decoherence as either inherent or imposed via qubit measurements. We now proceed\nby analyzing the effects deriving from coupling the photon modes to a zero temperature reservoir. The two qubit\nstates |\u00b1i are still taken to be metastable and losses are\ntherefore solely in the boson fields. As for the case of\nqubit measurements, we model the irreversible coupling\n\n\f9\nand p\u0303 is a complex time-independent factor of order\nunity [59]. The form of the field density operator reads\n\nby a master equation [22]\n\u2202\u03c1(t)\n= \u2212i[\u03c1(t), \u0124RW A ]\n\u2202t\n\n\u03c1f =\n\n+\u03ba 2\u00e2\u03c1(t)\u00e2\u2020 \u2212 n\u0302a \u03c1(t) \u2212 \u03c1(t)n\u0302a\n\n(22)\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n+\u03ba 2b\u0302\u03c1(t)b\u0302\u2020 \u2212 n\u0302b \u03c1(t) \u2212 \u03c1(t)n\u0302b .\nHere, \u03ba is the common decay rate of the two modes. The\nabove equation is commonly used for a zero temperature\nphoton reservoir, the generalization to non-zero temperature typically implies two extra Lindblad terms that are\nas well proportional to \u03ba. In the case of strong qubit-field\ncoupling, it has been shown that such a master equation\ndoes not in general decay into the correct canonical distribution [58]. However, at zero temperature as considered\nhere, the long time behavior of the above master equation\nis physically relevant [58]. In contrast to Eq. (17) which\ndescribes decoherence, the above equation (22) results in\ndissipation of cavity photons to the reservoirs. As will be\nseen, pure dephasing and dissipation have different influences on the Josephson oscillations. Direct dephasing of\nthe boson modes, without dissipation, is obtained by replacing \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 by n\u0302a (and similarly for the b mode) in\nthe two Linblad terms.\n\nZ(t)\n\n(a) 1\n0\n\u22121\n\n|R(t)|\n\n(b) 1\n\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\nt\nFIG. 7: Evolution of the scaled photon inversion Z(t) (a)\nand the Bloch vector amplitude |R(t)| (b) in the presence of\nphoton dissipation. The Bloch vector amplitude displays a\ncombination of Gaussian and exponential decay. The scaled\nJosephson oscillations, however, survives much longer. The\nparameters are as in Fig. 2, but with \u03b1 = 3 and \u03ba = 0.0012g\ncorresponding to the experimental decay rate of Ref. [60].\n\nExactly like in the previous sections, we can find an\nanalytical solution of Eq. (22) in the linear dispersive\nregime [59]. In the long time limit and letting \u03b4 = 0, the\natomic density operator becomes\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1 \u03c1+\u2212\n,\n(23)\n\u03c1at (t) =\n2 \u03c1\u2212+ 1\nwhere\n\u03c1+\u2212 = p\u0303e\n\n\u2212\u03ba\u03b7 2\n\n\u0010\n\nU\n\u03ba2 +U 2\n\n\u00112\n\nt\n\n(24)\n\n1\n[|a+ , b+ iha+ , b+ | + |a\u2212 , b, iha\u2212 , b\u2212 |] ,\n2\n\n(25)\n\nwhere the explicit expressions for the coherent amplitudes a\u00b1 (t) and b\u00b1 (t) in the most general case are rather\ncomplex, see Ref. [59]. They become, however, simple in\nthe limit of no pumping, \u03b7 = 0,\nhn\u0302a i =\n\n\u03b12 \u22122\u03bat\ne\n[1 + cos(2U t)],\n2\n\n(26)\n\n\u03b12 \u22122\u03bat\nhn\u0302b i =\ne\n[1 \u2212 cos(2U t)].\n2\nIt follows that the inversion Z(t) = cos(2U t) as without\nlosses. In general though, with \u03b7 6= 0, the expression for\nthe inversion becomes very complicated. Nonetheless, for\nthis case we note that generally hn\u0302a i =\n6 hn\u0302b i in the limit\nt \u2192 \u221e. This derives from the fact that the two mode\nwere initially differently populated. As a consequence\nof this, the photonic inversion does not approach zero;\nlimt\u2192\u221e Z(t) 6= 0. Moreover, as long as \u03b4 6= 0, the initial\ndecay of Z(t) is not exponential, which is in contrast\nto pure dephasing. We will also see that non-linearities\nbeyond the above analytical model play an important\nrole.\nAs before, our numerical investigation goes beyond the\nlinear regime of the analytical consideration. We solve\nthe master equation (22) with the same procedure as in\nthe previous section. For the photon decay rate we take\nan experimentally relevant value of \u03ba = 0.0012g [60]. The\nnumerical results are shown in Fig. 7. The rest of the parameters are the same as in the example of Fig. 2, except\nthat the amplitude of the initial coherent state \u03b1 = 3\n(instead of \u03b1 = 4 as in Fig. 2). As in the case of pure\ndephasing, the Bloch vector amplitude displays an interplay between Gaussian decay and recurrences and exponential decay. Contrary to the example of dephasing, the\namplitude does not approach zero in the long time limit.\nThis does not, however, imply that the qubit is entangled\nwith the boson modes. Since the evolution is not unitary,\nthe linear entropy (nor the Bloch vector amplitude) is a\ngood measure of entanglement. In fact, the off-diagonal\nelements of both \u03c1at and \u03c1f vanish in the long time limit.\nIt is interesting to note that the behavior of the system with photon dissipation is very different from the\ncase with dephasing. Dephasing induced an exponential\ndecay of the photon numbers hn\u0302a i and hn\u0302b i such that\nhn\u0302a i = hn\u0302b i for large times. The same kind of exponential\ndecay was seen in the photon inversion Z(t) (see Fig. 5\n(a)). Dissipation causes as well an exponential decay of\nhn\u0302a i and hn\u0302b i towards their steady state values, but Z(t),\non the other hand, does not decay exponentially. At first,\nthe scaled Josephson current is not greatly affected by\nthe dissipation. After \u223c 6 full Josephson oscillations, the\nscaled current begin to decay, however with something\nmore reminiscent of Gaussian decay. As the amplitudes\n\n\f10\n\nVI.\n\nQUANTUM THERMALIZATION?\n\nThermalization in quantum systems is normally attributed to dissipation and external decoherence [19, 22].\nAssuming a quantum system S to be irreversibly coupled\nto a thermal reservoir with some characteristic temperature T , and denoting the state of the system as \u03c1s , by\nwaiting long enough the state of the system normally becomes diagonal and on the form\n\u03c1s \u221d e\u2212\u03b2 \u0124s ,\n\n\u03c1s will remain pure, i.e. Tr[\u03c12s (t)] = 1. However, this\ndoes not forbid the state \u03c1A of subsystem A of the total system S to become diagonal. We saw examples of\ntemporary subsystem diagonalization in the previous sections. This, of course, is an effect of the inherent decoherence enforced upon subsystem A. Whether a recurrence\nof the off-diagonal terms appears is a highly legitimate\nquestion. More precisely, one wishes to understand if,\nwhy, and how \u03c1A attains an asymptotic diagonal distribution that can be modeled by a microcanonical ensemble. When thermalized, the assymptotics of any expectation value of some operator \u00c2 acting on the subsystem A can be obtained from statistical mechanical arguments. This is a topic of current intense research [18].\nA rule of thumb is that a chaotic system thermalizes in\nthe above sense. The present model, in its closed counterpart, Eq. (2), is not chaotic and contains only a few\ndegrees of freedom, and one thereby do not expect thermalization. In fact, we know that for relatively localized\ninitial states (h\u2206n\u0302i \u223c hn\u0302i), the JC model possesses a series of collapse-revivals [12], and we will not have any\nthermalization. Things may become more interesting if\nwe go beyond the RWA and include the counter rotating\nterms to our Hamiltonian. The model is then believed to\nbe non-integrable [13, 62]. Even so, within the range of\nour numerics, generic thermalization is not found in our\nmodel. Instead, we will consider an even weaker type\nof thermalization that was recently discussed by Ponomarev et al. in Ref. [31]. Their model does not put\nany constrains on integrability nor on a large number of\ndegrees-of-freedom. In this respect it is more related to\nthe system at hand.\n\nZ(t)\n\n(a) 1\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u0124s is the system Hamiltonian and \u03b2 = kB T is\nthe Boltzmann's constant time temperature T . The reduction of the off-diagonal coherence terms of \u03c1s is an\noutcome of the dissipation and decoherence induced by\nthe reservoir. On the other hand, assuming \u03c1s to be initially pure and the system to be closed, it follows that\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n(b) 1\n|R(t)|\n\nof the two modes decrease, the rapid oscillations deriving\nfrom the non-zero pumping becomes more pronounced,\nand after around 20 full oscillations the pumping induced\nfluctuations washes out the Josephson oscillations and a\nnew structure in Z(t) emerges. This additional inference\npattern is not seen in the regime where the Josephson oscillations are still well resolved. It is important to point\nout, even though the Josephson oscillations may survive\nrelatively long, it should be remembered that the photon\namplitudes hn\u0302a i and hn\u0302b i can become very small putting\nlimitations on photon detection. Today, on the other\nhand, very small field amplitudes (hn\u0302i \u226a 1) can be measured [1].\nIn order to confirm the differences between dephasing\nand dissipation of the boson modes (Figs 5 and 7), we\nhave numerically solved the dephasing master equation,\ni.e. replacing \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 by n\u0302a and replacing b\u0302 and b\u0302\u2020 by\nn\u0302b in the Linblad terms. This time, the inversion Z(t)\ndecays exponentially in a similar way as in Fig. 5 (a).\nFigure 7 has been calculated using physically relevant\nparameters and we thereby conclude that the intrinsic\nphotonic Josephson effect should indeed be realizable.\nHowever, only around 10 Josephson oscillations survive.\nOn the other hand, also for the intrinsic and extrinsic\nbosonic Josephson effect studied in Bose-Einstein condensates is typically only detected during a few oscillations [28, 61]. Our numerical analysis does not allow us\nto go to larger photon numbers, but increasing the initial\namplitude \u03b1 may prolong the oscillation time. It should\nbe noted though, that increasing the number of photons\nwhile keeping the detuning \u2206 fixed increases the nonlinearity, which might lead to undesired effects. Stronger\npumping will help in terms of preserving a measurable\nnumber of photons in the two modes, but it will as well\nimply a bigger impact of rapid oscillations on top of the\nJosephson oscillations. Optimizing the system parameters might be tricky, but it is nonetheless clear that the\nexample of Fig. 7 is probably not at all the most optimal\none in terms of a sustainable Josephson effect.\n\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nt\n\n6\n\n7\n5\n\nx 10\n\nFIG. 8: Evolution of the scaled photon inversion Z(t) (a) and\nthe Bloch vector amplitude |R(t)| (b) for an initial thermal\nstate in mode a and vacuum in b. The inversion shows a\nGaussian collapse, and at later times revivals build up indicating absence of thermalization. The Bloch vector amplitude\ncollapses and revive at half the inversion revival and also at\nthe revival of the inversion. In between these revivals a series\nof fractional revivals are seen. The dimensionless parameters\nare \u03c9c = 54.3g, \u03a9 = 150g, and n\u0304a = 5.\n\nThe Hamiltonian considered in [31] has the form\n\u0124P = \u0124A + \u0124B + \u0124int ,\n\n(28)\n\n\f11\nwhere \u0124A and \u0124B act in subsystems A and B respectively, and they are assumed identical \u0124A = \u0124B ,\nand furthermore the interaction is taken on the form\n\u0124int = \u0176A \u2297 \u0176B where \u0176A = \u0176B and they too act\nin the respective subsystems. Thus far, the model is\nrather generic. However, one more constrain is assumed,\nletting En be the n'th eigenvalue of \u0124P they assumed\nEn \u2212 Em = Es \u2212 Ew if and only if s = n and w = m.\nWithin this model, Ponomarev et al. showed that for\nan initial state \u03c1(0) = \u03c1A (0) \u2297 \u03c1B (0), with \u03c1A,B (0) thermal states characterized by the temperature TA and TB\nrespectively, the asymptotic states \u03c1A (\u221e) = \u03c1B (\u221e).\nHence, regardless of the two temperatures TA and TB ,\nthe system thermalizes to states with a common temperature. It was further demonstrated that this property\nis not restricted to initial thermal states, but holds for\nmore general diagonal initial states \u03c1A (0) and \u03c1B (0).\nAs a closed system (28), we will in this section neglect\nany irreversible coupling to reservoirs. Thinking of subsystem A and B as our two boson modes, it is clear that\nour model does not fulfill the above constrains. First\nof all, the qubit adds extra degrees-of-freedom, and secondly, not even in the linear regime (i.e. the importance\nof the qubit degrees-of-freedom has been omitted) does\nour Hamiltonian possesses the desired form (28). Furthermore, within the RWA, the linearized model has a\nspectrum that does not obey En \u2212 Em 6= Es \u2212 Ew for\ndifferent (n, m) and (s, w). This condition can, however,\nbe met by including the counter rotating terms, in other\nwords go beyond the RWA. To have a time-independent\nmodel we do not consider external pumping, and our\nHamiltonian to be studied in this section is then\n\u0011 \u03a9\n\u0010\n\u0124 = \u03c9c \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + b\u0302\u2020 b\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302z\n2\n(29)\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011i\n\u0001\n\u2020\n\u2020\n+g \u00e2 + \u00e2 + b\u0302 + b\u0302 \u03c3\u0302x .\n\nWe know that the qubit induces an effective coupling\nof the two modes, and that the counter rotating terms\nbrings about an irregularity of the spectrum. Therefore,\nit feels natural to expect our non-RWA system to thermalize in the sense of Ref. [31].\nAs our initial state we let the qubit be in the same\npure state as earlier, mode b in vacuum, and mode a in\na thermal state\n\u03c1A (t = 0) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\u0304na\n|nihn|,\n(n\u0304a + 1)n+1\nn=0\n\n(30)\n\nwhere n\u0304a determines the number of thermal photons, i.e.\nhn\u0302a i = n\u0304a . At zero temperature, T = 0, we naturally\nhave n\u0304a = 0. Note that beyond the RWA, the number of\nexcitations is not conserved. If we assume that the energy\nexchange between the fields and the qubit is small within\nthe large detuning regime, thermalization then implies\n\u03c1A (\u221e) = \u03c1B (\u221e) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\u0304n\n|nihn|,\n(n\u0304 + 1)n+1\nn=0\n\n(31)\n\nwith n\u0304 = n\u0304a /2.\nOur numerical results, presented in Fig. 8, demonstrates a Gaussian collapse of the photon inversion into\na state with a thermal distribution. However, after some\ntime the Josephson oscillations sets off again and the system revive. The two collapsed field states showed identical thermal like photon distributions, but the off diagonal\ncoherence terms of the states are not exactly zero which\ncauses the revival. In the JC model, the revivals become\nmore fuzzy with time and after very long times the revivals begin to overlap causing super-revivals. The well\nresolved collapse-revival structure of Fig. 8 (a) seems to\nsurvive for extremely long times, and within our numerical tests we have surprisingly not seen any long time decay of the revivals. The amplitude of the revivals varies,\nbut every now and then a revival appears where Z(t) oscillates approximately between -1 and 1. Furthermore,\nwe have checked our findings for different initial populations n\u0304a and \u2206. However, if \u2206 is taken too small the\nnon-linearity is very strong and the whole collapse-revival\nstructure smears out. The Bloch vector amplitude displayed in Fig. 8 (b) reproduces a similar collapse-revival\nstructure as was found in Fig. 2 (b), i.e. consisting of\na series of full and fractional revivals. Thus, once more\ndoes the qubit possesses a more complex dynamics than\nthe Josephson current. The increased qubit purity at\nhalf the revival time is reminiscent of that encountered\nin the regular JC model [23]. Not shown in Fig. 8 is\nthe field purity. Despite the fact that the initial state\nis mixed and one would expect thermalization, we have\nfound that the field purity displays a similar structure as\nthe Bloch vector amplitude. Thus, the structure of the\nfield purity contradicts as well thermalization. We should\npoint out that we have also verified similar results as the\nones above when the qubit is an initial maximally mixed\nstate, \u03c1at (t = 0) = (|+ih+| + |\u2212ih\u2212|)/2.\nFigure 8 hints that our system does not thermalize.\nTo explore this further, we consider instead an initial\ndiagonal state\n\u03c1A (t = 0) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n|\u03b1|2n\n|nihn|.\nn!\nn=0\n\n(32)\n\nThus, despite being diagonal the photon distribution is\nPoissonian as for a coherent state. In Fig. 9 we display\nthe corresponding field linear entropy Pf (t) (a). This\nis compared with the field linear entropy with an initial\npure state \u03c1A (t = 0) = |\u03b1ih\u03b1|. The general structure is\nthe same between the two cases, but it is clear that even\nat the well resolved revivals the purity of the initially\nmixed state is not increased considerably. Nonetheless,\nit clearly demonstrate the absence of thermalization.\nFinally we explore a different definition of thermalization which was discussed in Ref. [32]. With the model\nHamiltonian (29), the time-averaged reduced density operators\nZ\n1 T\n\u03c1\u0304\u03b1 = lim\ndt \u03c1\u03b1 (t),\n\u03b1 = A, B,\n(33)\nT \u2192\u221e T 0\n\n\f12\nboson Josephson junction formed in a Bose-Einstein condensate [30], we also examine the prospects of using the\nqubit as a quantum meter for the Josephson oscillations.\nWe show that the Josephson current can be measured by\nintegrating the length of the Bloch vector.\n\n0.96\n\nf\n\nP (t)\n\n(a)\n0.94\n0.92\n\nf\n\nP (t)\n\n(b) 0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nt 4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\nx 10\n\n5\n\nFIG. 9: Evolution of the field linear entropy Pf (t) for an\ninitial mixed field state of mode a (32) (a), and a coherent\nstate with the same photon distribution as the mixed state\n(b). The b-mode is initially in vacuum and the qubit as in\nprevious examples. The general structure is similar in both\ncases, but the initial mixed state stays largely mixed even at\nthe revivals in contrast to the initial pure state which almost\nperfectly regains its purity at the half and full revivals. The\ndimensionless parameters are as in Fig. 8, except the initial\nmean number of photons n\u0304a = 16.\n\nwhere analyzed. If \u03c1\u0304\u03b1 becomes diagonal, the system\nclearly has thermalized. We do not show our results here,\nbut we have verified for different initial states and parameters that the time-averaged reduced density operators do\nnot diagonalize. Thus, once again we have found absence\nof thermalization.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a most simple model that simulates\nthe photonic counterpart of a bosonic Josephson junction. Opposed to earlier studies of the photonic Josephson effect, our model describes the internal effect. In\nthe dispersive regime a qubit mediates an effective coupling between two photon modes of either an optical or\na transmission line resonator. After introducing the general model we demonstrated the Josephson effect both\nwithin a linear analytic model and using full numerical diagonalization. Our numerical results shows the presence\nof collapse-revivals originating from the intrinsic qubitfield non-linearity.\nWe continued by addressing several aspects that arises\nfrom decoherence in one or another way. To start with,\nwe considered inherent decoherence of the qubit stemming from interaction with the quantized boson modes.\nIn such a Markovian analysis we found a rapid Gaussian decay of the qubit purity, at quarter of a Josephson\noscillation period the qubit has lost almost entirely its\ncoherence. At half an oscillation, the coherence is essentially completely regained. Our setup serves as well as a\nrealization of the \"quantum gatekeeper model discussed\nin [30]. As in Ref. [30], regarding a qubit coupled to a\n\nWhat was not put forward in [30] is the backaction\na qubit measurement has on the Josephson current itself. As a first example, we mimicked the irreversible\nqubit measurement within a master equation approach.\nThe induced dephasing of the qubit rapidly propagates\nto the boson modes which leads to an exponential decay of the oscillations. The more information subtracted\nfrom the qubit, the stronger is the demolishing effect on\nthe Josephson oscillations. This fact demonstrates the\nmacroscopic nature of the Josephson oscillations as a collective quantum many-body phenomenon. As a second\nexample, we considered non-selective or projective measurements, and such interrupted unitary evolution was\nshown to render a quantum Zeno slowing down of the\nJosephson oscillations.\nThe following section looked into effects deriving from\ncavity dissipation. Again, this was modeled utilizing a\nmaster equation. The important result coming out from\nthis analysis was the fact that even when realistic experimental parameters was considered, the Josephson oscillations survived for around 10 full oscillations. This is\nindeed comparable, or even longer, than what has been\nobserved in either Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in\ndouble-well potentials [28], or in spinor condensates with\nRaman coupled Zeeman levels [61]. A somewhat surprising finding was that photon dissipation did not render an\nexponential decay of the scaled Josephson current, but\ninstead we found a Gaussian decay. This is in contrast\nto the exponential decay of the amplitudes of the two\nmodes, and also to the exponential decay of the scaled\ncurrent when exposed to dephasing.\nWe finished our investigations by considering thermalization in a weak sense. That is, we did not study equilibration into microcanonical ensembles where the expectation values h\u00c2i can be predicted by the corresponding ensembles [18], but thermalization of two interacting\nthermal quantum systems according to [31]. Our model\nfulfills most of the constrains for such thermalization,\nbut it was demonstrated that despite this we do not find\nthermalization. Lack of the sort of thermalization as discussed in [32] was also numerically verified.\nThroughout we assumed the two boson modes to be degenerate. Our results would still be valid even if we drop\nthis constrain. Then, however, should it be noted that\nthe Josephson effect is detuned and hence not all photons will be swapped between the two modes. In circuit\nQED, which utilizes transmission line resonators, there is\nin general only a single mode for a given frequency. However, in optical Fabry-Perot cavities there are typically\ntwo orthogonally polarized degenerate modes. Noteworthy is that bimodal cavity QED experiments have already\nbeen demonstrated [63].\n\n\f13\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author acknowledges financial support from the\nSwedish Research Council.\n\n[1] S.
