I focus on the program HERWIG at LHC.\n\n1\n\nThe status\n\nLHC is a discovery machine, it is expected to tell us how to complete the unified theory\nof elementary interactions. New (heavy) particles are searched to indicate/confirm new\nsymmetries. Events with heavy particles are expected to be accompanied by an intense\nemission of hadrons at short distances, and this is the domain of perturbative QCD.\nTherefore, to identify and understand non-standard events a quantitative knowledge of\nthe characteristics of the hard radiation is strongly needed. In 1973 QCD was at the\nfrontier of particle physics (discovery of asymptotic freedom [1] and beginning of quantitative QCD studies), now in 2007 QCD is at the center of particle studies. The Monte\nCarlo programs for jet emissions [2\u20134] are important instruments for analyzing standard\nand non-standard short distance events. They are the Summa of most QCD theoretical\nresults and many present studies aim to improve their quantitative predictions. Thanks\nto the QCD factorization structure [5], Monte Carlo programs can be interfaced with hard\ncross sections involving also non-QCD processes (electroweak, supersymmetric, extra dimension, black holes, ...). In this way, Monte Carlo generators can describe both QCD\nand non-QCD events at short distances.\nIn this paper I describe the main QCD results which enter the construction of a\nMonte Carlo generator. They are so many that most of the key points will be recalled\nin a schematic way, but I hope that this short description could provide an idea of the\nreliability range of the Monte Carlo generators. For a more detailed description see [6].\nHere, aiming to be simple and synthetic, I follow a personal point of view and the focus\nwill be on the Monte Carlo event generator HERWIG [2]. Its general structure is similar\nto other important Monte Carlo generators [3, 4]. In section 2 I present the scheme of\nthe operations performed by Monte Carlo codes for LHC. The fact that the generation of\nevents can be subdivided into successive stages is physically based on QCD factorization\nproperties. The theoretical basis are discusses/recalled in section 3. In section 4 I discuss\n1\nTo appear in the volume String Theory and Fundamental Interactions, published in honour of Gabriele\nVeneziano on his 65th birthday, eds. M. Gasperini and J. Maharana, Lecture Notes in Physics, Springer,\nBerlin/Heidelberg 2007.\n\n\fthe multi-gluon soft distributions and in section 5 I describe in detail a Monte Carlo\ncode for soft emissions. Although important non-soft contributions included in a realistic\nMonte Carlo are here missed, it provides a simple example containing many important\nphysical effects. In section 6 I discuss non-perturbative effects which enter the Monte\nCarlo generators. The last section contains final considerations.\n\n2\n\nStructure of Monte Carlo generator\n\nI start describing schematically the way a Monte Carlo code is organized in order to\ngenerate hard QCD and non-QCD events at LHC. As a specific illustration I consider the\nemission of two jets with high ET . This process is factorized into the elementary hard\ndistribution, the parton densities (structure functions as in DIS) and the fragmentation\nfunctions (as in e+ e\u2212 ):\np\n\nElementary hard distribution\nQ ET\n\nStructure function\nFragmentation function\n\np\n\nHere are the necessary factorised steps:\n\u2022 start form the hard elementary distribution \u03c3\u0302ab\u2192cd with ab the incoming and cd\nthe two outgoing partons. This hard distribution corresponds to QCD jet emission\nat high ET . Here one can substitute distributions for other QCD or non-QCD\nprocesses. There are many studies of hard distribution for processes relevant for\nLHC, see [7].\n\u2022 generate the momenta of the hard incoming (ab) and outgoing (cd) partons (and possible non-QCD particles). Given the hard scales ET (and possible heavy masses), the\nmomenta are generated (via important sampling) in computing the total cross section as convolutions of the elementary distribution and the parton densities (structure functions);\n\u2022 use the initial state space-like evolution (which at the inclusive level gives the structure functions) to generate the \"bremsstrahlung\" of outgoing initial state partons\nk1\u2032 , k2\u2032 * * * . This requires imposing a minimal transverse momentum w.r.t. the collision direction;\n\u2022 given the outgoing hard QCD partons cd and k1\u2032 , k2\u2032 * * * , start the QCD shower\n(parton multiplication). First, from the set of these partons, identify their colour\nconnections and reconstruct the set of the various primary q q\u0304 dipoles. Here one\nworks in the large Nc approximation so that a gluon, from the colour point of view,\ncan be represented as a pair of quark-antiquark lines, a gluon is then associated to\ntwo dipoles;\n\n\f\u2022 generate, for each primary dipole, the multi-parton emission according to the coherent branching structure that will be illustrated in the following. This requires\nimposing a lower bound on the relative transverse momenta of final state partons\n(inside sub-jets);\n\u2022 match with the exact high order calculation, if available. It consists in weighting\nthe generated event by comparing [8] the Monte Carlo distribution and the exact\nsquare matrix element computed to higher order [7];\n\u2022 given the system of all emitted partons, generate the final hadrons by using a hadronisation model making hadrons out of partons. Using hadronisation models based\non colour connections and preconfinement [9], such a process should not substantially modify [10] the structure of the hadronic radiation with respect to the partonic\none which has been obtained in the previous steps.\nIn the next sections I describe the QCD basis of these steps.\n\n3\n\nThe long way to Monte Carlo\n\nQCD has a dimensionless coupling but, even at large scale Q, when all masses can be\nneglected, the cross sections do not scale simply as powers of Q2 . This is due to the\npresence of ultraviolet, collinear and infrared divergences. Ultraviolet divergences are\nresponsible for the presence of the fundamental QCD scale \u039bQCD entering the running\ncoupling. Collinear and infrared divergences are well know from QED [11]. Parton distributions can be computed only by fixing a resolution Q0 (technically, a subtraction point)\nin the parton transverse momentum. Collinear and infrared divergences are responsible\nfor large enhancements in these distributions which need to be resummed. Monte Carlo\ngenerators do actually perform these resummations as I discuss in the following.\nThe possibility to resum these enhanced terms is based on specific properties of the\ncollinear and infrared singularities: they factories [5, 12, 13]. In this way one can formulate recurrence relations that lead to evolution equations. The fundamental one is the\nDGLAP evolution equation [14] resumming collinear singularities in parton densities and\nfragmentation functions. These are single-inclusive quantities, but to reach a complete\ndescription of an event one needs many-particle distributions so that the fully exclusive\npicture can be reconstructed (with given resolutions). The way to this is the jet-calculus\nformulated and constructed by Ken Konishi, Akira Ukawa and Gabriele Veneziano [15]\nas generalization of the DGLAP evolution equation. Therefore their work can be considered as the basis of the Monte Carlo parton multiplication. Jet calculus leads the way\nto the evolution equation for the generating functional [12, 13] of the multi-parton distributions and then to the branching probabilities for parton splitting in a way that could\nbe implemented into Monte Carlo codes. The pioneering Monte Carlo codes [16\u201318] were\nresumming collinear singularities but only after the discovery of coherence of soft gluon\nradiation, both collinear and infrared enhanced logarithms where correctly resummed.\nThe present Monte Carlo generators [2\u20134] fully resum not only the leading collinear and\ninfrared singularities, but also relevant subleading contributions.\nIn the following I describe the main theoretical points corresponding to the Monte\nCarlo steps recalled in the previous section.\n\n\f3.1\n\nAsymptotic freedom and physical coupling\n\nAt short distance the theory becomes free [1] and here the use of perturbation theory is\njustified. At two loops one has\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03b21 ln L\nQ2\n4\u03c0\n1\u2212\n+\n.\n.\n.\n,\nL\n=\nln\n\u226b 1,\n(1)\n\u03b1s (Q) \u2243\n\u03b20 L\n\u03b202 L\n\u039b2QCD\nwith \u03b20 = 11 \u2212 32 nf , \u03b21 = 51 \u2212 19\nn and nf the number of light flavours.\n3 f\nTo account for high order effects one needs to start from the scheme for the definition of the running coupling. A physical definition [19] is given by the strength of the\ndistribution for the emission of a soft gluon k off a colour singlet pair of a massless quark\nand antiquark of momenta p, p\u0304. It is given by\ndwpp\u0304 (k) = CF\n\n\u03b1s (kt ) d3 k\n,\n\u03c0 kt2 2\u03c0|~k|\n\nkt2 = 2\n\n(pk)(k p\u0304)\n,\n(pp\u0304)\n\n(2)\n\nand corresponds to the coupling associated to the Wilson loop cusp anomalous dimension\n[20]. The relation to the MS coupling is known at three loops [21]. The argument of\nthe coupling, the transverse momentum kt relative to the emitting dipole, is obtained by\nusing dispersive methods [12, 22] or, directly, by two loop calculations [23]. In order to\naccurately describe soft emissions, the physical coupling with the argument in (2) is used\nin the Monte Carlo generators.\n\n3.2\n\nCoherence of soft gluons and colour connection\n\nSuccessive soft gluon emission takes place into angular ordered regions with intensities\nrelated to the colour charges. In the large Nc limit these regions are identified by the\nparton colour connections. To explain this one starts from the emission of a soft gluon k\noff a colour singlet q q\u0304 pair, the dipole (2). This distribution has collinear singularities for\n\u03b8pk = 0 or \u03b8kp\u0304 = 0. Introducing the angular variable \u03beij = 1 \u2212 cos \u03b8ij one can isolate the\ntwo singular pieces and write\n\u0012 p\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\np\u0304\n(pp\u0304)\n\u03bepp\u0304 \u2212 \u03bepk\n1 \u03a8pp\u0304 (k) \u03a8pp\u0304 (k)\np\n1\nwpp\u0304 (k) =\n+\n, \u03a8pp\u0304 (k) = 2 1 +\n,\n(3)\n=\n(pk)(k p\u0304) ~k 2\n\u03bepk\n\u03bekp\u0304\n\u03bekp\u0304\nand similarly for the function \u03a8p\u0304pp\u0304 (k) associated to the singularity for \u03bekp\u0304 = 0. Performing\nthe integration of \u03a8app\u0304 (k) over the azimuthal angle around a one has\nZ\nd\u03c6ak a\n\u03a8 (k) = \u0398(\u03bepp\u0304 \u2212 \u03beak ) ,\na = p, p\u0304 .\n(4)\n2\u03c0 pp\u0304\nThis shows that the soft dipole distribution is made up of two collinear pieces, the one\nsingular for k collinear to a (\u03beak = 0) is (upon azimuthal averaging) bounded to a cone\naround a with opening half-angle \u03b8pp\u0304 . Since the q q\u0304 dipole is a colour singlet system, the\np and p\u0304 colour lines are \"connected\".\nThis coherent structure can be generalized to the soft emission of a gluon k off a\ncolour singlet system made of any number of partons. Consider a q q\u0304 g colour singlet of\nmomenta p, p\u0304 and q respectively. The distribution is given by (for simplicity we take also\nthe gluon q to be soft)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(5)\nwpp\u0304g (k) = wpp\u0304 (q) * wpq (k) + wqp\u0304 (k) \u2212 2 wpp\u0304 (k) .\nNc\n\n\fSplitting all dipole distributions as in (3) one can classify all collinear singularities in\nsuccessive emissions within corresponding angular regions. One finds that the piece which\nis singular for k collinear to a (with a = p, p\u0304 or q) is bounded to a cone around a with\nopening half-angle \u03b8ab with b the parton colour connected to a (recall that in the planar\nlimit the gluon is equivalent to a quark-antiquark pair).\nThis angular ordered structure associated to colour connections at large Nc has been\nextended [24] to the 2 \u2192 2 QCD hard processes needed for LHC and used in [2]. Beyond\nlarge Nc , the structure of soft radiation off the 2 \u2192 2 hard QCD is quite more complex;\nit involves [25] rotation in the colour space for the hard matrix elements and includes\nCoulomb phase contributions. This is a very interesting contribution and would be nice\nif it could be included in a future Monte Carlo generator.\nThe distribution of a soft gluon k emitted off a colour singlet pair of massive quark\nand antiquark P and P\u0304 is given by\nWP P\u0304 (k) =\n\n\u2212 12\n\n\u0012\n\nP\nP\u0304\n\u2212\n(P k) (P\u0304 k)\n\n\u00132\n\n=\n\n2\nP2\n(P P\u0304 )\n1 P\u0304\n\u2212 12\n,\n\u2212\n(P k)2 2 (P\u0304 k)2\n(P k)(k P\u0304 )\n\n(6)\n\np\nwith (ij) = Ei Ej (1 \u2212 vi vj cos \u03b8ij ) and vi = 1 \u2212 m2i /Ei2 . While in the massless case (3)\nthe distribution is collinear singular for k parallel to the emitting charges, in the heavy\nquark case the collinear singularities are screened: distribution vanishes for k parallel to\nthe heavy quark (or antiquark) Pa and the radiation is suppressed [26, 27] in the cone\ncos \u03b8ak > va .\nThe heavy quark screening is included into the Monte Carlo generators. One needs\nto avoid sharp cutoff around the heavy quark which, taken together with the angular\nlimitations, would leave a dead cone, a phase space region without radiation.\n\n3.3\n\nSudakov form factor and jets\n\nAn important element in Monte Carlo generator is the probability that, in a hard process,\na parton is not radiating within a given resolution, the Sudakov form factor. To introduce\nthis quantity, consider the inclusive distributions (no particle momenta are measured\nbut only energy flows) which are free from collinear and infrared singularities. Classical\nexamples in e+ e\u2212 are the jet-shapes distributions \u03a3(Q, V ) with\nX\nV =\nv(ki ) .\n(7)\ni\n\nHere the sum runs over all particles in the final state (hadrons in the measurements and\npartons in the calculations). For v(k) linear in the particle momentum, such jet-shape\nobservables are collinear and infrared safe. Actually individual Feynman diagrams for\nreal emitted partons and virtual corrections are divergent but they are summed in such\na way that, order by order, the infinities cancel [11] leaving finite results.\nCollinear and infrared safe jet-shape distributions \u03a3(Q, V ) have a perturbative expansion with finite coefficients\n\u03a3(Q, V ) = \u03a30 (Q, V )(1 + \u03b1s (Q) c1 (V ) + \u03b1s2 (Q) c2 (V ) + * * * ) ,\n\nQ \u226b \u039bQCD\n\n(8)\n\nwith \u03a30 (Q, V ) the Born distribution and ci (V ) finite functions of V expressed in terms\nof the quark, CF , or gluon, CA , colour charges. Actually, by inhibiting the radiation by\ntaking V \u226a 1, these coefficients are enhanced by powers of ln V . A clever reshuffling\n\n\fof PT series, based on universal nature of soft and collinear radiation (factorization)\nresults [12, 13] in the exponentiated answer of the Sudakov form factor S(Q, V )\n\u03a3(Q, V ) = \u03a30 (Q, V ) * S(Q, V ) ,\nS(Q, V ) = e\u2212R(Q,V ) ,\n\u221e\nX\n\u0001\nR(Q, V ) =\n\u03b1sn (Q2 ) dn lnn+1 V + sn lnn V + * * * .\n\n(9)\n\nn=1\n\nThe dn series is referred to as double logarithmic (DL) and sn as single logarithmic (SL).\nReliable predictions for these distributions require the matching [28] of the exact finite\norder calculation (8) for finite V and the Sudakov resummation (9) for small V .\nIt is instructive to discuss the emergence of the powers of ln V in the Sudakov form\nfactor S(Q, V ). They result from the incomplete cancellation of real and virtual effects.\nFor V \u226a 1 the real parton production is inhibited, one has v(k) < V \u226a 1. Since the\nvirtual PT radiative contributions remain unrestricted, the divergences do cancel in the\nregion v(k) < V leaving only virtual contributions for v(k) > V which produce finite\nbut logarithmically enhanced leftovers. The DL contributions originate from the fact\nthat each gluon emission brings in at most two logarithms (one of collinear, another of\ninfrared origin). This explains the first term d1 ln2 V while the rest of the DL series is\ngenerated simply by the presence of the running coupling (1). The SL contributions, are\nnecessary to set the scale of the logarithms (lnn cV = lnn V + n ln c lnn\u22121 V + * * * ).\nIn conclusion, the Sudakov form factor S(Q, V ) corresponds to the probability that\nin e+ e\u2212 the primary quark-antiquark pair remains without accompanying radiation up to\nresolution Q0 = V Q for small V .\nTo obtain the result (9) one uses the fact that the collinear and/or infrared enhanced\ncontributions factories and are resummed by linear evolution equations of the DGLAP\ntype. Therefore, after factorization of collinear and infrared singularities (including soft\ngluon coherence) QCD radiation appears as produced by \"independent\" gluon emission\n(bremsstrahlung). Gluon branching (into two gluons or quark-antiquark pair) enters only\nin reconstructing the running coupling (1) as function of transverse momentum. The\nfact that here the branching component does not contribute (within SL accuracy) can be\nunderstood as a result of real-virtual cancellations of singularities. Indeed, in the collinear\nlimit, the transverse momentum of an emitted gluon is equal to the sum of transverse\nmomenta of its decay products. Therefore, if one measures the total emitted transverse\nmomentum, as in broadening for instance, it is enough to consider the contributions of\nprimary bremsstrahlung gluons. Further branching does not contribute due to unitarity\n(real-virtual cancellation).\n\n3.4\n\nStructure and fragmentation functions\n\nMoving to less inclusive measurements one faces infinities. The simple case involves fixing\n(measuring) momentum of a hadron, e.g. that of the initial proton in DIS (structure\nfunction) or of a final hadron (fragmentation function), they are functions of the Bjorken\nand Feynman variables respectively\nxB\n\n\u2212q 2\n=\n,\n2(P q)\n\nxF =\n\n2(P q)\n.\nq2\n\n(10)\n\nIn DIS q is the large space-like momentum transferred from the incident lepton to the\ntarget nucleon P . In e+ e\u2212 annihilation q is the time-like total incoming momentum and\nP the momentum of the final observed hadron.\n\n\fIn perturbative calculation, replacing the hadron with a parton, one has infinities,\nreal and virtual contributions do not cancel. Soft divergences still cancel but collinear ones\ndo not, making such observables not calculable at the parton level. These effects, however,\nturn out to be universal and, given a proper technical treatment, can be factored out [5]\nas non-perturbative inputs. What remains under control then is only the Q2 -dependence\n(scaling violation pattern). This fact is realized in the DGLAP evolution equation which\nneeds, in order to be solved, an initial condition at a low virtuality Q0 . This corresponds\nto a parton resolution (or a factorized subtraction point), which absorbs all large distance\ndivergences. Such \"initial condition\" cannot be computed by perturbative means and has\nto be provided by low scale experimental data.\n\nDGLAP evolution equation for DIS and e+ e\u2212\n\n3.5\n\nTo derive the DGLAP evolution equation [14] one needs to study the phase space region\nleading to collinear singularities. The same Feynman diagrams are involved in the case of\nstructure function (space-like) and fragmentation function (time-like). Therefore they can\nbe studied simultaneously. First note that the Bjorken and Feynman variables (10) are\nmutually reciprocal: after the crossing operation P \u2192 \u2212P one x becomes the inverse of the\nother (although in both channels 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1 thus requiring the analytical continuation).\nSuch a reciprocity property can be extended to the Feynman diagrams for the two\nprocesses and, in particular, to the contributions from mass-singularities. Consider, for\nDIS (S-case) and e+ e\u2212 annihilation (T-case), the skeleton structure of Feynman graphs\nin axial gauge and the kinematical relation leading to the mass-singularities\nq\nk'n\n\nkn\n\nk'\n\nn\u22121\n\nkn\u22121\n\nk\n\n1\n\nk'1\nk0\n\n!2\n\u2032\n2\n~k \u2032\n~kit\nki,+ ki,+\n|ki\u22121\n|\nk \u2032 2i\n|ki2 |\n=\n+ \u2032 +\n\u2212 \u2032it\nki,+\nki\u22121,+ ki,+\nki\u22121,+ ki,+ ki,+\n\n+ \u2212\n\nDIS or e e skeleton graphs\nHere k1\u2032 , * * * kn\u2032 are the outgoing parton systems (sub-jets). For space-like (S: q 2 < 0, k0\nentering) and time-like (T: q 2 > 0, k0 outgoing) one has\nS:\n\nki,+\n\u2261 zi\nki\u22121,+\n\nand\n\nT :\n\nki,+\n\u2261 zi\u22121 .\nki\u22121,+\n\n(11)\n\nThe virtuality ki2 enters the denominators of the Feynman diagrams. In order for the\ntransverse momentum integration produce a logarithmic enhancement, the conditions\nmust be satisfied\n2\n|ki\u22121\n|\n|k 2 |\n2\n\u226a i \u21d2 ki\u22121\n\u226a |ki2 | zi\u03c3 ,\n(12)\nki\u22121,+\nki,+\nwith \u03c3 = \u22121 for DIS and \u03c3 = 1 for e+ e\u2212 . The same Feynman graphs are contributing and,\ngoing from S- to T-channel, the mass singularities are obtained by reciprocity: change\nz into 1/z and the momentum k from space-like to time-like. This fact is at the origin\nof the Drell-Levy-Yan relation [29] and Gribov-Lipatov [30] reciprocity which has been\nlargely used in order to obtain the time-like anomalous dimensions from the space-like\nones [31, 32]. The ordering (12) in the inverse fluctuation time k 2 /k+ is well known, see\nfor instance [33].\n\n\fTo make the Gribov-Lipatov reciprocity more clear, use the ordering (12) in the\ncomputation of the probability D\u03c3 (x, Q2 ) to find a parton with longitudinal momentum\nfraction x and virtuality |k 2 | up to Q2 with \u03c3 = \u22121 for the S-case and \u03c3 = 1 for the T-case.\nThis ordering gives rise to the following reciprocity respecting equation [34]\nZ 1\n\u0010x\n\u0011\ndz\n2\n2\nP (z, \u03b1s ) D\u03c3\n, Q2 z \u03c3 , \u03c3 = \u00b11 ,\n(13)\nQ \u2202Q2 D\u03c3 (x, Q ) =\nz\nz\n0\n\nwith the same parton splitting kernel P (z, \u03b1s ) in the S- or T-channel. This equation,\nderived simply from kinematical considerations, has been (partially) tested at two [31]\nand three loop [21, 34, 35].\nThe reciprocity respecting equation (13) is non-local since the derivative of D\u03c3 (x, Q2 )\nin the l.h.s. involves the distribution in the r.h.s. with all virtualities larger or smaller\nthan Q for \u03c3 = \u22121 or \u03c3 = +1 respectively. For the use in a Monte Carlo generator\none needs to formulate (13) in terms of a local evolution equation, a Markov process.\nFormally this is easy to do: as a hard scale for the parton densities replace Q2 with\nQ\u03042+ = x Q2 in the T -case and, by reciprocity, with Q\u03042\u2212 = x\u22121 Q2 in the S-case. The\nphysical meaning of these two different hard scales is well known from the studies of soft\ngluon coherence [12, 13, 33, 36]: in the T -case is related to the branching angle and in the\nS-case to the transverse momentum.\nIt is interesting to illustrate this. The fact that, in the T-case, the ordering variable\n2\n2\nis not the inverse fluctuation time k 2 /k+ (12) but rather the angle k 2 /k+\n\u2243 kt2 /k+\n\u2243 \u03b8k2 ,\noriginates from cancellations [36] due to destructive interference in the region\nT-case:\n\n2\nzi2 ki2 < ki\u22121\n< zi ki2 ,\n\n(14)\n\n2\nthus leaving the angular ordered region ki\u22121\n< zi2 ki2 . Using reciprocity (zi \u2192 zi\u22121 ) one has\nthat in the S-case the canceling region (14) becomes\n\nS-case:\n\n2\n|ki2 | < |ki\u22121\n| < zi\u22121 |ki2 | ,\n\n(15)\n\n2\n2\nthus leaving the transverse momentum ordering kt,i\u22121\n< kt,i\n. This agrees also, at small x,\nwith the BFKL [37] leading order multi-parton kinematical region.\nThe cancellation in the region (15) has a well known physical basis for small x.\n\u2032\nConsider (see the skeleton graph) the successive emissions ki\u22122 \u2192 ki\u22121 + ki\u22121\nand ki\u22121 \u2192\n\u2032\nki + ki in the region ki,+ \u226a ki\u22121,+ \u226a ki\u22122,+ giving the leading contribution for small x.\nThese cancellations result from taking into account the emission of ki off the partons ki\u22122\n\u2032\nand ki\u22121\nin the region (15). Physically, the process can be viewed upon as an inelastic\ndiffraction of the incident particle ki\u22122 in the external gluon field of transverse size of\norder kit . In the kinematical region (15) the transverse size of the parton fluctuation\n\u2032\nki\u22122 \u2192 ki\u22121 + ki\u22121\nis smaller than the resolution power of the probe, kit2 . In these\ncircumstances the destructive interference between ki interacting with the initial (ki\u22122 )\n\u2032\nand with the final state (ki\u22121 + ki\u22121\n) comes onto the stage. The cancellation under\ndiscussion is then equivalent to the general physical observation, due to V.N.Gribov, that\ninelastic diffraction vanishes in the forward direction.\nTo deal with very small x one needs to resum at least all terms \u03b1sn lnn x as given\nby the BFKL equation [37] which cannot be accounted for by the collinear singularities\nresummation performed in the Monte Carlo codes. However, the evolution equation in [38]\nresums leading collinear and ln x terms (by enlarging the phase space and adding a nonSudakov form factor) and allows Monte Carlo simulations [39] with the cost of generating\nevents which need to be weighted.\n\n\f4\n\nMulti-gluon soft distributions\n\nCollinear and infrared pieces of the multi-parton QCD distributions factories and can\nbe reproduced by recurrence relations which can be formulated as a Markov branching\nprocess. This can be implemented into a Monte Carlo code and the simulation provides\na \"complete\" description of the multi-parton emission in hard process.\nI illustrate in detail the case in the leading soft approximation. Although important\nnon-soft contributions that are included in a realistic Monte Carlos are here neglected,\nmany important physical effects are well described, in particular, large angle soft emission\n(without collinear approximation). Moreover, in this approximation the path from multigluon soft amplitudes to Monte Carlo is simple to explain. The scheme of the presentation\ninvolves the following steps:\n\u2022 multi-gluon soft distributions. They are computed in the leading soft approximation\nand in the planar approximation;\n\u2022 recurrence relation for the multi-gluon soft distributions. This is obtained by introducing the generating functional for all multi-gluon distributions [12] and deriving\nthe evolution equation. From the generating functional one computes observables\nas it will be discussed in subsection 4.2. For collinear and infrared safe observables\nsuch as jet-shape distributions the cutoff contributes only with power corrections;\n\u2022 Markov process and Monte Carlo implementation. Here one needs to include proper\ncutoff for collinear and infrared singularities. This will be discussed in the next\nsection 5.\n\u2022 from parton to hadron emission. This will be discussed in section 6.\nThe starting point is the amplitude for the emission of n soft gluons q1 , * * * , qn off\na primary colour singlet q q\u0304 pair of momentum p, p\u0304. It is represented as a sum of ChanPaton factors with the coefficients given by colour-ordered amplitudes. We consider the\ncontribution with a single Chan-Paton factor (topological expansion [40])\nX\n{\u03bbai1 * * * \u03bbain }\u03b2 \u03b2\u0304 Mn (pqi1 * * * qin p\u0304) ,\n(16)\nMn (pp\u0304q1 * * * qn ) =\n\u03c0n\n\nthe sum is over the permutation \u03c0n of colour indices, \u03bba are the SU(Nc ) matrices in the\nfundamental representation. The softest emitted gluon qm factorizes and one has [12, 42]\n\u0012 \u03bc\n\u0013\nql\nql\u03bc\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nMn (* * * l m l * * * ) = gs Mn\u22121 (* * * ll * * * ) *\n.\n(17)\n\u2212\n(ql qm ) (ql\u2032 qm )\nThe softest gluon is emitted by the two partons neighbouring in colour space. This\napproximation is accurate in the soft limit without any collinear approximation. From this\nfactorized structure one deduces a recurrence relation and computes all colour-amplitudes\nin the soft limit. Summing over the polarization indices, the squared averaged colouramplitude is given, for the fundamental colour permutation, by\n|Mn (pq1 * * * qn p\u0304)|2 = |M0 |2 (2gs2 )n Wpp\u0304 (q1 * * * qn ),\n\nWpp\u0304 (q1 * * * qn ) =\n\n(pp\u0304)\n. (18)\n(pq1 ) * * * (qn p\u0304)\n\nThis very simple result for the square amplitude is valid for any energy ordering and\ndepends only on the colour ordering. Note that here one takes the square of the same\n\n\fcolour-ordered amplitude. Indeed Mn (\u03c0n\u2032 )Mn\u2217 (\u03c0n ) with \u03c0n and \u03c0n\u2032 two different colour\npermutations cannot be expressed in a closed form for any n. On the other hand contributions from different permutations enter the calculation of the averaged squared amplitude\n|Mn |2 . A close expression for this distribution for any n is obtained only in the planar\napproximation [41]. To see this observe that\nTr(\u03bb\u03c0n \u03bb\u03c0nT ) = 2CF\n\n\u0012\n\nNc\n2\n\n\u0013n \u0012\n\u0013n\u22121\n1\n1\u2212\nNc\n\n(19)\n\nwith \u03bb\u03c0n = {\u03bba1 * * * \u03bban } and \u03bb\u03c0nT = {\u03bban * * * \u03bba1 }. Taking instead two different colour\npermutations one has that Tr(\u03bb\u03c0n\u2032 \u03bb\u03c0nT ) is suppressed at least by 1/Nc2 . Therefore, only in\nthe planar approximation one can use the simple result in (18) and obtains [12]\nX\n\u03c30\n|Mn |2 =\n(Nc gs2)n\n(20)\nWpp\u0304 (qi1 * * * qin )\nn!\n\u03c0\nn\n\nwhere \u03c30 = 2CF |M0 |2 and symmetrisation has been taken into account.\nThe distributions (18) contain the leading infrared singularities: for any colour permutation one has Wpp\u0304 \u223c (\u03c91 * * * \u03c9n )\u22122 with \u03c9i the energy of gluon qi . They contain also\nthe leading collinear singularities for \u03b8ij = 0 with ij two partons neighbouring in colour\n(thus there are up to n collinear singularities).\nAn alternative way to obtain the the multi-gluon colour amplitude is based on the\nhelicity techniques [43]. For q q\u0304 with + and \u2212 polarization, the leading soft contribution\nis obtained when all gluons have + helicities and the recurrence relation (17) reads (for\nopposite helicities the result is the complex conjugate one)\nMn (* * * l m l\u2032 * * * ) = gs Mn\u22121 (* * * ll\u2032 * * * ) *\n\nhql ql\u2032 i\n,\nhql qm i hqm ql\u2032 i\n\nhqq \u2032 i =\n\nwith qm the softest gluon, z the longitudinal direction and the phase\ns\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\nq+ q+\nq\u2032t\nqt\ni\u03c6qq\u2032\n\u2212 \u2032 ,\nqt = qx + iqy .\ne\n=\n2qq \u2032 q+ q+\n\np\n2qq \u2032 * ei\u03c6qq\u2032 , (21)\n\n(22)\n\nThe solution of this recurrence for the amplitude is very simple; it is the same for any energy ordering and depends only on the colour ordering. For the fundamental permutation\none has\nhpp\u0304i\n,\n(23)\nMn (pq1 * * * qn p\u0304) = gsn M0\nhpq1 i * * * hqn p\u0304i\n\nwith squared amplitude given by (18). This shows the well known result that non-planar\ncontributions, obtained from Mn (\u03c0n ) * MN\u2217 (\u03c0n\u2032 ) for two different colour orderings, have the\nsame soft singularities but reduced number of collinear singularities.\n\n4.1\n\nVirtual correction, generating functional and evolution\n\nTo compute observables one needs to supplement the multi-gluon soft distributions (20)\nwith the related virtual corrections. For infrared and collinear safe observables, such as\njet-shape distributions, the infrared and collinear singularities in (18) has to be canceled\nby corresponding singularities in virtual corrections. One way to compute the virtual\ncorrections, at the same level of accuracy in the soft limit as for real emission contribution,\n\n\fconsists of performing the integration over the virtual gluon energy by the Cauchy method\nand then taking the soft limit for the virtual gluon. This way one also regularizes the\nultraviolet divergences by neglecting the divergent contribution from the contour at the\ninfinity of the complex energy plane. By properly choosing a constant this regularization\ncorresponds to the physical scheme in (1). The virtual corrections so computed can be\nincluded into the generating functional for the multi-gluon soft distributions. The result of\nthis study not only gives the relevant virtual corrections but, due to the simple structure\nof (20) in the planar approximation, gives the branching structure of multi-gluon soft\nemission leading to the Monte Carlo generator.\n(n)\nConsider the soft distribution d\u03c3ab for the emission of n gluons off a colour singlet\ndipole ab (thus one generalizes the primary dipole pp\u0304 to a general dipole with a and b\nin arbitrary directions). For each emitted soft gluon qi one introduces a source function\nu(qi ) and defines the generating functional as\nX 1 Z d\u03c3 (n) Y\nab\nGab [E, u] =\nu(qi ) ,\n(24)\ntot\nn!\n\u03c3\nab\nn\ni\nwith E = Q/2 the hard scale. This functional depends on the directions a and b of the\nprimary dipole. By setting all u(qi ) = 1 one has Gab [E, 1] = 1. Using (20) one has the\nreal emission contribution for the generating functional\n\u001b\nX Z Y\u001a\nd\u03a9qi\nreal\n\u03c9i d\u03c9i \u0398(E \u2212\u03c9i ) * Wab (q1 * * * qn ),\n(25)\nGab [E, u] =\n\u1fb1s u(qi )\n4\u03c0\nn\ni\n\nwith \u1fb1s = Nc \u03b1s /\u03c0. Here one neglects 1/Nc2 corrections (planar limit) and uses the soft\napproximation for the phase space \u03c9i \u226a E. Symmetry of the phase space is used. The\ncondition Gab [E, 1] = 1 must be satisfied only after including the virtual corrections. To\ninclude them we construct the evolution equation for the generating functional. To this\nend we use the fact that the very simple expression (18) has the following factorization\nproperty\nWab (q1 * * * qn ) = wab (ql ) * Wal (q1 * * * ql\u22121 ) * Wlb (ql+1 * * * qn ) ,\n(26)\n\nwith ql one of the soft gluons and wab (q) the dipole distribution (3). Taking ql as the\nhardest (soft) gluon and differentiating (25) with respect to E, thus setting \u03c9l = E, one\nobtains [44]\nZ\no\nd\u03a9q \u1fb1s \u03beab n\nE\u2202E Gab [E, u] =\nu(q) Gaq [E, u] * Gqb [E, u] \u2212 Gab [E, u] ,\n(27)\n4\u03c0 \u03beaq \u03beqb\n\nwith \u03beij = 1 \u2212 cos \u03b8ij . The negative term in the integrand originates from the virtual\ncorrections obtained via Cauchy integration as mentioned before. Since they are evaluated\nwithin the same soft approximation used for the real contributions, at the inclusive level\nthey cancel against the real contributions giving the correct constraint Gab [E, 1] = 1. Both\nthe real emission (first term in the integrand) and the virtual correction (second term) are\ncollinear and infrared singular. For inclusive observables, (i.e. for suitable sources u(q))\nthese singularities cancel. This evolution equation accounts for coherence of soft gluon\nradiation [12, 13].\n\n4.2\n\nObservables in the soft limit\n\nUsing Gab [E, u] one obtains all inclusive distributions in the soft limit. No collinear\napproximations are involved in (20), therefore the functional Gab [E, u] gives quantities\n\n\fwhich involves also large angle soft emission. Let me first recall some observables which\nare collinear singular around the primary partons a and b.\nCollinear observables. The simplest one is the multiplicity of soft gluons with resolution Q0 . Taking u(q) = u this observable is defined as, see (24),\nnab (E) = \u2202u Gab (E, u)\n\nu=1\n\nX \u03c3 (n)\n.\n=\nn ab\ntot\n\u03c3ab\nn\n\nIt is easy to derive from (27) the well known result [36] for the multiplicity\n( s\n)\n4\u03c0\n2N\nc\n(0)\nnab (E) \u2243 nab exp\n,\n\u03b20 \u03c0\u03b1s (E)\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\n(0)\n\nwith nab the non-perturbative initial condition. Similarly one derives the fragmentation\nfunction Dab (x, E) by taking the source u(q) = u(x) with x the soft gluon energy fraction\nDab (x, E) =\n\n\u03b4\nGab [E, u]\n\u03b4u(x)\n\nu(x)=1\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\nSoft gluon coherence here is shown by a depletion of radiation [12, 13] at small x.\nObservables at large angle. The simplest case is the distribution discussed in [45]\nof heavy systems of mass M emitted in e+ e\u2212 at large angle \u03c1 = 12 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) and small\nvelocity. The heavy system (typically a heavy q q\u0304 system) originates from a gluon in the\ncascade. The collinear singularities are screened by M so this distribution is finite and\ngiven by a function of the SL quantity\nZ E\ndqt\n\u03c4=\n\u1fb1s (qt ) .\n(31)\nM qt\nIt is interesting that this distribution I(\u03c1, \u03c4 ) satisfies an equation with a structure similar\nto the BFKL equation [45] and then its asymptotic behaviour in \u03c4 involves the BFKL\ncharacteristic function. One has\nI(\u03c1, \u03c4 ) \u223c\n\ne4 ln 2 \u03c4 ln \u03c10 /\u03c1 \u2212 ln2 \u03c10 /\u03c1\n* \u221a e 2D\u03c4 ,\n\u03c4 3/2\n\u03c1\n\nD = 28 \u03b6(3) .\n\n(32)\n\nThe functional Gab [E, u] is suited to give the distributions in the energy emitted away\nfrom jets. Such distributions do not have collinear singularities, but only infrared ones.\nAn example in e+ e\u2212 is the distribution in energy recorded outside a cone \u03b8in around the\nthrust (this is a typical \"non-global\" jet observable [46]):\nthrust\naxis\n\n\u03b8in\nin\n\nout\nout\n\nin\n\nX Z d\u03c3n (E)\nX\n\u03a3(E, Eout ) =\n\u0398 Eout \u2212\nkti\n\u03c3\ntot\nn\nout\n\n!\n\n.\n\nSince the jet region is excluded, there are no collinear singularities to SL accuracy and\nthe resummed PT contributions come from large angle soft emission. Here resummation\nis complex but informative. It brings information on the QCD radiation between jets, a\nregion interesting for understanding colour neutralization among jets.\n\n\fIt is interesting to discuss this quantity in some detail since it illustrates the structure\nof (27). First observe that the distribution depends on E and Eout through the SL function\n\u03c4 given by (31) with M \u2192 Eout . To obtain \u03a3(\u03c4 ) from Gab [E, u] one takes u(q) = 0\naway from jets and u(q) = 1 inside the jet region. From (27) one derives the evolution\nequation [44]\nZ\no\nd\u03a9q \u1fb1s \u03beab n\n\u03a3aq (\u03c4 ) * \u03a3qb (\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03a3ab (\u03c4 ) ,\n(33)\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03a3ab (\u03c4 ) = \u2212sab \u03a3ab (\u03c4 ) +\nin 4\u03c0 \u03beaq \u03beqb\nwith sab related to the Sudakov form factor\n\u2212\u03c4 sab\n\nS(\u03c4 ) = e\n\n,\n\nsab =\n\nZ\n\nout\n\nd\u03a9q \u03beab\n\u22121\n\u223c ln \u03b8in\n.\n4\u03c0 \u03beaq \u03beqb\n\n(34)\n\nEquation (33) has a bremsstrahlung (first) and branching (second term) components:\n\nbremsstrahlung component\n\nbranching component\n\nThe bremsstrahlung component resums contributions from gluons emitted in the recorded\nregion outside the cone. These contributions are the only ones present for the global jet\nobservables considered in the previous subsection. Here, since the collinear singularities\nare screened by the cone \u03b8in , the Sudakov form factor is a SL function.\nThe branching component resums contributions from gluons emitted inside the jet\nregion. These gluons need to branch in order to generate decay products entering the\nrecorded region. Here real-virtual cancellation is incomplete and virtual enhanced contributions are dominating thus leading to a strong suppression of the distribution which\nasymptotically turns out to be Gaussian in \u03c4 .\nThe Monte Carlo generator [2] resums only collinear singularities therefore it does not\nfully resum soft emissions at large angles although phenomenologically, it turns out [47]\nthat the most important pieces are correctly reproduced due to soft gluon coherence.\n\n5\n\nMonte Carlo simulation for soft emission\n\nThe evolution equation (27) can be formulated as a Markov process and then numerically\nsolved. This Monte Carlo procedure has been introduced in [46] to study non-global\ndistributions. A similar procedure based on dipole branching is used in the Monte Carlo\ngenerator [4].\nTo construct a Monte Carlo generator from (27) one splits the real and virtual corrections. To do so it is necessary to introduce a cutoff Q0 in transverse momentum (the\nargument of \u03b1s ) giving the Sudakov form factor\nZ E\nZ\nd\u03c9q d\u03a9q \u1fb1s \u03beab\n\u03beaq \u03beqb\n2\nln Sab (E) = \u2212\n* \u03b8(qtab \u2212Q0 ) ,\nqtab\n= 2 \u03c9q2\n(35)\n4\u03c0 \u03beaq \u03beqb\n\u03beab\nQ 0 \u03c9q\nwhich is the solution of (27) with the real emission piece neglected. Here qtab is the\ntransverse momentum of q with respect to the ab-dipole. Then the evolution equation\n(27) can be integrated to give (the cutoff Q0 dependence is implicit)\nZ\nGab [E] = Sab (E, Q0 ) + dPab (E, \u03c9q , \u03a9q ) u(q) Gaq [\u03c9q , u] * Gqb [\u03c9q , u] ,\n(36)\n\n\fwhere one has introduced the probability for dipole branching: (ab) \u2192 (aq) (qb)\n\u001b\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a\nd\u03a9q \u1fb1s \u03beab\nd\u03c9q Sab (E)\n* \u03b8(qtab \u2212Q0 ) .\ndPab (E, \u03c9q , \u03a9q ) =\n\u03c9q Sab (\u03c9q )\n4\u03c0 \u03beaq \u03beqb\n\n(37)\n\nTo see how this could be used in a Monte Carlo simulation one writes dPab (E, \u03c9, \u03a9) in\nthe equivalent form (the bound qtab > Q0 is implicit)\ndPab (E, \u03c9, \u03a9) = drab (E, \u03c9) * dRab (\u03a9)\n\n(38)\n\nwith\nSab (E)\nrab (E, \u03c9q ) =\n,\nSab (\u03c9q )\nd\u03a9q \u1fb1s \u03beab\ndRab (\u03a9q ) = Nab\n,\n4\u03c0 \u03beaq \u03beqb\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\ndrab (E, \u03c9q ) = 1 \u2212 Sab (E)\n\n(39)\n\ndRab (\u03a9q ) = 1 .\n\nThe integral of the branching probability gives\nZ\ndPab (E, \u03c9, \u03a9) = 1\u2212Sab (E) ,\n\n(40)\n\nand this shows that the Sudakov factor Sab (E) gives the probability for not emitting a\ngluon within the resolution Q0 in qtab .\nThe probability distribution dPab (E, \u03c9, \u03a9) can be used to generate Monte Carlo\nevents distributed according to QCD in the soft and planar approximation. Using sets of\nrandom numbers 0 < \u03c1 < 1 the procedure is the following:\n1. take the ab-dipole with the energy scale E and compare the Sudakov factor Sab (E)\nwith \u03c1. If \u03c1 < Sab (E) then the ab-dipole does not emit any soft gluon within the\nresolution. In the opposite case the dipole is emitting a soft gluon with energy \u03c9q\ngiven by solving the equation \u03c1 = rab (E, \u03c9q );\n2. obtain the direction \u03a9q by sampling the distribution dRab (\u03a9q ). At this point, from\nthe ab-dipole one has generated two dipoles: aq and qb, both at the new energy\nscale \u03c9q ;\n3. repeat the procedure for each new generated dipole till no dipole emits any more\nwithin the resolution.\nAt the end of this procedure one is left with a Monte Carlo event: a collection of\nemitted soft gluons q1 * * * qn together with the primary partons a, b. These events are\ndistributed with the QCD probability so they ca be used to compute any soft distribution\nas discussed in subsection 4.2.\nSuch a Monte Carlo simulation, based on evolution equation in energy, is then a\nsuccessive emission of softer and softer gluons. Angles are given by the dipole distribution (3) so they are ordered (upon azimuthal average) and coherence is automatically\nimplemented.\nIn order to obtain a realistic simulation one needs to overcome the soft approximation,\nthat is, to take into account the recoil in the emission and the non-soft pieces of the gluon\nsplitting function (only the singular pieces are present in (27))\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n+\n+ z(1\u2212z)\u22122 .\n(41)\nPg\u2192gg (z) = Nc\nz 1\u2212z\n\n\fSimilarly, one needs to account also for the quark branching channels. All these points\nare accounted in the present realistic Monte Carlo generators. Their basis is an evolution\nequation in angle rather than in energy (as (27)). However this implies that one considers\ncollinear approximations in the emission thus soft radiation at large angles are not fully\naccounted for.\n\n6\n\nFrom partons to hadrons\n\nThe above description of the Monte Carlo code refers to the generation of events with\nemission of partons (possibly together with non-QCD particles) which, due to the presence\nof collinear and infrared singularities, requires a cutoff Q0 . The main questions are then:\nhow to go from partons to hadrons and how much a phenomenological hadronisation\nmodel affects and distorts the QCD radiation generated perturbatively. A suggestion\non hadronisation models which do not substantially modify the peturbative radiation is\nprovided by preconfinement [9].\nPreconfinement. The basis is again the Sudakov function which suppress the probability of \"non-emitting\". Consider, in the planar approximation, two colour connected\npartons emitted in a hard collision at scale Q and with resolution Q0 . Colour connection\nmeans that the quark colour line of one parton ends into the antiquark colour line of\nthe other parton (in the planar approximation a gluon could be, from the colour point\nof view, described as a pair of q q\u0304 colour lines). Thus no gluons are emitted within the\nresolution Q0 by this colour line and a Sudakov form factor arises which forces the two\ncolour connected partons to form a system of mass of order Q0 (even for very large Q).\nThe system of the quark and antiquark in question forms a colour singlet of small mass.\nAlthough this is not yet an indication of confinement (the colour system should be localized in space), such a preconfinement property suggests that any hadronisation models\nthat associates hadrons to colour connected partons would not distort the perturbative\nstructure of the QCD radiation: parton and hadron flows are similar within the resolution Q0 . Preconfinement is then related to the property of local hadron-parton duality [10]\nwhich has been phenomenologically well tested.\nPower corrections. Other non-perturbative effects are the power corrections to the\nobservables. They result from the non-convergence the PT expansions even if the coefficients are finite as in (8) and (9). As a consequence all PT predictions are affected\nby corrections in powers of \u039bQCD /Q with coefficients determined by NP effects. An important NP effect, present in short distance quantities, is that the running coupling is\ninvolved at any scale smaller than Q. For example, the average value of V in (7) is given\nby an integral of the type\nZ Q\ndkt\nhV i =\n\u03b1s (kt ) * V(kt /Q) = v1 \u03b1s (Q) + v2 \u03b1s2 (Q) + * * * ,\n(42)\nk\nt\n0\nwhere the virtual momentum kt in the Feynman diagrams runs into the large distance\nregion (although the observable is dominated by short distance physics). Since the observable is collinear and infrared finite, for kt \u2192 0 the Feynman integrand is regular\n(V(kt /Q) \u223c kt /Q) so that the integral is finite, apart from the presence of \u03b1s (kt ) which\nenters the confinement region. Mathematically this is reflected into the fact that, although\n\n\fall PT coefficients in \u03b1s (Q) are finite, the expansion is non-convergent [48] (renormalon\nsingularity).\nThe fact that the running coupling entering the NP region is at the origin of the\nleading power correction can be checked phenomenologically. From the study of jet-shape\nobservable one finds [49] that, within 10 \u221220%, the power corrections are described by\nthe same parameter accounting for the running coupling in the NP region. In the Monte\nCarlo generators one sets a cutoff Q0 in the argument of the coupling and this does bring\nin these physically relevant power corrections at the perturbative - parton - stage.\nInstead, power behaving contributions to jet shapes arise at the hadronisation level [51].\nUnderlying event. Another important NP component in the Monte Carlo for LHC\nis the presence of radiation besides the one emitted in the hard event. This is typically\naround the beams as for the peripheral interactions (events at low ET ). Perturbative\nQCD does not provide indication for this component. Thus there are various models\nwhich needs to be studied [50] at the Tevatron together with the extrapolation at LHC.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat I have discussed shows that the Monte Carlo generators involves the entire Summa of\nhard QCD results and provide a framework for many future QCD and non-QCD studies.\nThe general attempts to improve the Monte Carlo generators go in the directions of\nmaking the quantitative predictions both more reliable (by adding new theoretical QCD\nresults and phenomenological studies) and more general (by including also electroweak\nand beyond the standard model physics). As far as the first direction, I have mentioned\nthe works made to include in the Monte Carlo generator the known exact higher order\ndistributions [8]. As also mentioned, it is interesting to include into the present generators\nreliable predictions on large angle soft emission (see subsection 4.2). This would require\nalso the need to account for non-planar corrections by studying colour rotations involved\nin the colour structure of ensembles of more than three hard partons (see [25]).\nThe three key elements in a Monte Carlo generator for jet emissions are the QCD\nfactorization properties, the branching algorithm and the procedure for converting partons into hadrons. As I have mentioned, Gabriele Veneziano has either contributed to or\nstarted each of these three key developments: The Monte Carlo generators are based on\nfactorization of QCD collinear singularities [5]. Jet calculus [15] leads to the evolution\nequation for the generating functional for multi-parton distributions which can be formulated as a Markov process. Moreover, the preconfinement property [9] is at the basis of\nhadronisation models that do not destroy the QCD radiation structure.\n\nAcknowledgements\nIn addition to Gabriele, I am grateful to the many colleagues which shared with me the\nbeauty of QCD and in particular to Bryan Webber, we undertook the risk of conveying\nincomplete theoretical concepts and results into an event generator, and to Marcello\nCiafaloni, Yuri Dokshitzer and Al Mueller, for many discussions during the construction\nof the original Monte Carlo generator.\n\n\fReferences\n[1] D.J.
