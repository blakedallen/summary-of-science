Introduction\nLet H \u221e be the Banach space of bounded analytic functions on the open unit\ndisk D with norm kf k\u221e := supz\u2208D |f (z)| < \u221e. The closed unit ball S of H \u221e\n(sometimes called the Schur class) thus consists of analytic functions mapping D\ninto its closure. The classical Schur problem which we will denote by SPn consists\nof finding f \u2208 S having prescribed n + 1 Taylor coefficients at the origin.\nSPn : Given c0 , . . . , cn \u2208 C, find all functions f \u2208 S of the form\nf (z) = c0 + c1 z + . . . + cn z n + O(z n+1 ).\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe problem has a solution if and only if the Pick matrix of the problem given by\nPn = I \u2212 T (cn , . . . , c0 )T (cn , . . . , c0 )\u2217\nis positive semidefinite.

For an admissible data set, the parametrization of the solution set\nof the problem SPn was established in [7] via the famous Schur algorithm which\n(j)\nwe now recall.

In what follows, the polynomials Nf and Df will denote the numerator\nand the denominator from the coprime representation f = Nf /Df of a rational\nfunction f . By deg f = max{deg Nf , deg Df } we mean the McMillan degree of f .\nThe algebra of rational functions will be denoted by R and we will let\nRk := {f \u2208 R : deg f = k}\n\nand R\u2264k := {f \u2208 R : deg f \u2264 k} .\n\n\fLOW DEGREE RATIONAL SOLUTIONS\n\n3\n\nBeing adapted to the single-point case, the problem formulated in [1] is:\nRPn,k : Given c0 , . . . , cn \u2208 C and k \u2265 0, find all f \u2208 R\u2264k of the form (1.1).\nThe problem was solved in [1] and in [2] (for the matrix-valued case) as follows.\nTheorem 1.1. Let q denote the rank of the Hankel matrix H = [ci+j\u22121 ]i,j\u22651\nn\u22121\nif n is odd or\nconstructed from the given numbers cj (the matrix H is n\u22121\n2 \u00d7 2\nn\u22122\nn\n\u00d7\nif\nn\nis\neven).\nThen\n2\n2\n(1) There is no f \u2208 Rk satisfying (1.1) for every k < q or q < k \u2264 n \u2212 q.\n(2) There exists at most one function f of complexity k = q subject to (1.1).\n(3) For every k > n \u2212 q, there are infinitely many solutions of the problem\nRPn,k which are parametrized by the formula\nA11 g + A12\n,\n(1.9)\nA21 g + A22\nare polynomials explicitly constructed from the\n\nf = TA [g] :=\nwhere the coefficients Aij\ndata set and such that\n\u0015\n\u0014\nA11\n= q and\ndeg\nA21\n\n\u0015\nA12\n= n + 1 \u2212 q,\ndeg\nA22\n\u0014\n\nand where the parameter g = Ng /Dg \u2208 R is such that\ndeg Ng \u2264 k \u2212 q,\n\ndeg Dg \u2264 k + q \u2212 n \u2212 1,\n\nA21 (0)Ng (0) + A22 (0)Dg (0) 6= 0.\n\nWe refer to [2] for more details. In what follows, we use notation\nSR = S \u2229 R,\n\nSRk = S \u2229 Rk\n\nand SR\u2264k = S \u2229 R\u2264k\n\nfor the classes of functions in R, Rk and R\u2264k respectively, which are bounded by one\nin modulus on D. Upon imposing both H \u221e -norm and complexity constraints (i.e.,\nupon combining problems SPn and RPn,k ) we arrive at the following interpolation\nproblem.\nRSPn,k : Given an admissible data set c0 , . . . , cn and k \u2265 0, find all functions\nf \u2208 SR\u2264k of the form (1.1).\nOne may try to treat the latter problem using either formula (1.9) or (1.7). In\nthe first case, the complexity of f is completely controlled by the complexity of the\ncorresponding parameter g and it suffices to pick up all parameters g with deg g \u2264\nk\u2212q leading via formula (1.9) to Schur-class functions f . However, this task is hard,\nsince formula (1.9) does not control kTA [g]k\u221e in terms of kgk\u221e. It may happen\nthat a Schur class parameter g produces f 6\u2208 S and on the other hand, a Schur\nclass function f \u2208 SR\u2264k may arise from a non-Schur class parameter g. Although\nTheorem 1.1 guarantees that there are infinitely many functions f \u2208 Rn+1\u2212q of\nthe form (1.1), it is not known whether or not one of them is of the Schur class.\nThe question about the minimal possible k for which the problem RSPn,k has a\nsolution, is still open.\nIt is not even clear from (1.9) that the problem RSPn,k has solutions for k large\nenough. On the other hand, the affirmative answer for the latter question is readily seen from parametrization formula (1.7) which in contrast to (1.9), perfectly\ncontrols the H \u221e -norm of f : all Schur-class rational solutions to the problem SPn\narise via formula (1.7) from some Schur-class rational parameter E. The complexities of interpolants are controlled here to some extent. A straightforward induction\n\n\f4\n\nVLADIMIR BOLOTNIKOV\n\nargument deduces from (1.8) that the coefficients A, B, C and D in (1.7) are polynomials of respective degrees deg A = n + 1, deg B \u2264 n, deg C \u2264 n + 1, deg D \u2264 n\nand therefore,\ndeg T\u0398 [E] \u2264 n + 1 + deg E.\n(1.10)\nLetting E in (1.7) to run through the class of constant functions (not exceeding one\nin modulus), one gets a family of solutions f of the problem RSPn,n+1 , but not all\nthe solutions. It turns out that zero cancellations may occur in (1.7) due to which\nsome solutions to the RSPn,n+1 may arise from non-constant parameters. We also\nobserve that the parameter E \u2261 0 leads via (1.7) to the function T\u0398 [0] = B/D \u2208\nSR\u2264n which is therefore, a solution to the problem RSPn,n . The next example\nshows that this function might be the only solution to the RSPn,n .\nExample 1.2. Let |c0 | < 1 and cj = 0 for j = 1, . . . , n. With this data, the\nproblem RSPn,n has only one solution f \u2261 c0 . This follows from Theorem 1.1\nsince in this case q = 0.\nOtherwise (that is, if cj 6= 0 at least for one j \u2265 1 so that q \u2265 1), Theorem 1.1\nguarantees the existence of infinitely many functions f \u2208 R\u2264n of the form (1.1),\nat least one of which (T\u0398 [0]) belongs to SR\u2264n . As was shown in [4]-[6], the set of\nsuch functions is infinite and can be parametrized by polynomials \u03c3 with deg \u03c3 \u2264 n\nand with all the roots outside D. More precisely, for every such \u03c3, there exists a\nunique (up to a common unimodular constant factor) pair of polynomials a(z) and\nb(z), each of degree at most n and such that\n(1) |a(z)|2 \u2212 |b(z)|2 = |\u03c3(z)|2 for |z| = 1 and\n(2) the function f = b/a (which belongs to SRn by part (1)) satisfies (1.1) and\ntherefore, solves the RSPn,n .\nThe objective of this note is to present an alternative parametrization of the solution set of the problem RSPn,k (see Theorem 1.3 below) which relies entirely on\nparametrization formula (1.7). Some elementary analysis of the Schur algorithm\nwill relate complexities of E and deg T\u0398 [E] more accurately than in (1.10); this in\nturn, will allow us to describe all parameters E \u2208 SR leading via formula (1.7) to\nsolutions f of the problem RSPn,k (these parameters will be called admissible).\nExplicit construction of these parameters is given below in terms of certain algorithm which seems to be quite efficient and simple from the computational point of\nview. Here is the Algorithm:\nStep 1: Given c0 , . . . , cn , compute the numbers \u03b30 , \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3n by formula (1.4)\nusing iteration (1.3).\nStep 2: Using the numbers \u03b30 , . . . , \u03b3n compute the polynomials\nAn (z) =\n\nn\nX\n\naj z j\n\nand\n\nBn (z) =\n\nj=0\n\nfrom the system of recursions\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 A0 (z) \u2261 \u03b3n , B0 (z) \u2261 1,\nAj+1 (z) = zAj (z) + \u03b3n\u2212j\u22121 Bj (z),\n\uf8f3\nBj+1 (z) = z\u03b3 n\u2212j\u22121 Aj (z) + Bj (z),\n\nn\nX\n\nbj z j\n\n(1.11)\n\nj=0\n\n(j = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1).\n\n(1.12)\n\nIt is readily seen that Bj (0) = 1 for j = 0, . . . , n. In particular, b0 = Bn (0) = 1.\n\n\fLOW DEGREE RATIONAL SOLUTIONS\n\n5\n\nStep 3: Using the coefficients aj , bj from (1.11) define the lower triangular Toeplitz\nmatrices\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n1\n0\n*** 0\nan\n0 *** 0\n\uf8ef an\u22121 an * * * 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef b1\n1\n*** 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\ne\n(1.13)\nA=\uf8ef .\n,\nB\n=\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n.\n.\n.\n..\n.. . . . 0 \uf8fb\n..\n\uf8f0 ..\n\uf8f0 ..\n. 0 \uf8fb\na1\n\na2\n\n***\n\nan\n\nbn\u22121\n\nbn\u22122\n\n***\n\n1\n\nand compute the lower triangular Toeplitz matrix\ne \u22121 A.\nR = T (r1 , r2 . . . , rn ) := B\n\n(1.14)\n\nThe three first steps are preliminary and can be carried out in finitely many steps.\nThe last step tells which parameters E in (1.7) should be taken to get solutions to\nthe problem RSPn,k . We first consider the case where k = n.\nStep 4: For any n-tuple {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n } of complex numbers, compute the function\nE(z) =\nwhere \u03b20 , . . . , \u03b2n\u22121 are defined\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n\u03b20 + \u03b21 z + . . . + \u03b2n\u22121 z n\u22121\n\u03b10 + \u03b11 z + . . . + \u03b1n z n\nby\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u03b1n\n\u03b2n\u22121\n.. \uf8fa = \u2212R \uf8ef .. \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 . \uf8fb\n. \uf8fb\n\u03b20\n\n(1.15)\n\n(1.16)\n\n\u03b11\n\nwhere R is given in (1.14) and \u03b10 is such that E \u2208 S.\nThe main result of the paper is the following theorem; the proof will be given in\nSection 2.\nTheorem 1.3. Let E be constructed as in Step 4 and let \u0398 be as in (1.8). Then the\nfunction f = T\u0398 [E] (1.7) solves the problem RSPn,n and conversely, all solutions\nof the RSPn,n arise in this way.\nRemark 1.4. The only relatively uncertain part in Step 4 is the choice of \u03b10 .\nn\nX\n(|\u03b1i | + |\u03b2i\u22121 |), the\nHowever, it is readily seen that for any \u03b10 satisfying |\u03b10 | \u2265\ni=1\n\nfunction E in (1.16) belongs to the Schur class which immediately gives infinitely\nmany solutions of the problem RSPn,n . To be more precise, let us write (1.15) as\nE(z) =\n\nP (z)\n,\n\u03b10 + zQ(z)\n\nwhere P (z) = \u03b20 + \u03b21 z + . . . + \u03b2n\u22121 z n\u22121 and Q(z) = \u03b11 + . . . + \u03b1n z n\u22121 and let\nD(c, r) denote the disk of radius r centered at c. Then the set of all admissible\n\u03b10 's (for already chosen \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n and \u03b20 , . . . , \u03b2n\u22121 ) is the exterior (complement)\nof the domain \u03a9 defined as\n[\nD(\u2212zQ(z), |P (z)|).\n\u03a9=\n|z|<1\n\nRemark 1.5. It follows from (1.15) that a parameter E leading to a solution of\nthe RSPn,n has to satisfy E(\u221e) = 0. Thus, E \u2261 0 is the only admissible constant\nparameter for the problem RSPn,n . Combining this fact with (1.10), we conclude\n\n\f6\n\nVLADIMIR BOLOTNIKOV\n\nthat every other constant function E \u2208 S leads via (1.7) to a solution of RSPn,n+1 .\nAs we have already seen, in contrast to the case n = k, the existence of infinitely many solutions of the problem RSPn,k with k > n is immediate. However,\nthe description of all solutions is even somewhat more complicated. We get this\ndescription by an appropriate modification of Step 4 as follows.\nStep 4\u2032 : Let k > n be fixed and let \u0398 and R be as above. All solutions f to the\nproblem RSPn,k are obtained via formula (1.7) where the parameter E is either any\nfunction from SR\u2264k\u2212n\u22121 or a function from SR\u2264k of the form\nE(z) =\n\n\u03b2n\u2212k + \u03b2n\u2212k+1 z + . . . + \u03b2n\u22121 z k\u22121\n\u03b1n\u2212k + \u03b1n\u2212k+1 z + . . . + \u03b1n z k\n\n(1.17)\n\nwhere the coefficients \u03b1n\u2212k+1 , \u03b1n\u2212k+2 , . . . , \u03b1n and \u03b2n\u2212k , \u03b2n\u2212k+1 , . . . , \u03b2\u22121 are picked\nup arbitrarily, after which the coefficients \u03b20 , . . . , \u03b2n\u22121 are defined as in (1.16) and\nwhere after all, the coefficient \u03b1n\u2212k is chosen so that the function E of the form\n(1.17) belongs to the Schur class S.\nJustification of Step 4\u2032 will be given in Section 2. In Section 3 we will present a\nversion of Step 4 suitably modified for the case where k < n. There we will explain\nthe reasons (by means of parametrization formula (1.7)) for which the algorithm is\nnot efficient for k < n.\n2. Proof of Theorem 1.3.\nIn this section we justify the algorithm presented in the previous section. Let\n\u0398k (z) := Wn\u2212k (z) * * * Wn (z)\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the factors Wj are defined in (1.8). Comparing (2.1) and (1.8) we see that\n\u0398n equals the coefficient matrix \u0398 of the transformation (1.7). It is not hard to\ncheck by induction that \u0398k is of the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\nzBk\u266f (z) Ak (z)\n\u0398k (z) =\n(2.2)\nzA\u266fk (z) Bk (z)\nwhere the polynomials Ak and Bk are constructed from system (1.12) and where\nA\u266fk and Bk\u266f are defined as follows:\nA\u266fk (z) = z k Ak (1/z\u0304),\nLet us take any E =\n\u0398n = \u0398 into (1.7):\n\nNE\nDE\n\nBk\u266f (z) = z k Bk (1/z\u0304).\n\n(2.3)\n\n\u2208 SR and substitute it together with formula (2.2) for\n\nf (z) =\n\nzBn\u266f (z)NE (z) + An (z)DE (z)\nzA\u266fn (z)NE (z) + Bn (z)DE (z)\n\n.\n\n(2.4)\n\nRemark 2.1. The numerator and the denominator in (2.4) do not have common\nzeros and thus,\nNf = zBn\u266f NE + An DE\n\nand Df = zA\u266fn NE + Bn DE .\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fLOW DEGREE RATIONAL SOLUTIONS\n\n7\n\nProof: Taking determinants in (1.8), (2.1) and (2.2) (with k = n) gives\n1\n* det \u0398n (z)\n(2.6)\nBn (z)Bn\u266f (z) \u2212 An (z)A\u266fn (z) =\nz\nn\nn\nY\n1 Y\n=\n(1 \u2212 |\u03b3j |2 ).\ndet Wj (z) = z n *\n*\nz j=0\nj=0\nTherefore, the only possible common zero for the numerator and the denominator\nin (2.4) is z = 0. But if this is the case, we then have Bn (0)DE (0) = DE (0) = 0\nwhich is impossible since the Schur function E cannot have a pole at the origin. \u0003\nWe shall now compare McMillan degrees of f and f1 in formula (1.5).\nLemma 2.2. Let f \u2208 SR be of the form (1.5). Then deg f \u2212 1 \u2264 deg f1 \u2264 deg f .\nMoreover,\ndeg f1 = deg f \u21d0\u21d2 f1 (\u221e) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 f (\u221e) 6= 1/c\u03040\n\n(2.7)\n\ndeg f1 = deg f \u2212 1 \u21d0\u21d2 f1 (\u221e) 6= 0 \u21d0\u21d2 f (\u221e) = 1/c\u03040 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nand\n\nProof: Take f1 in the form f1 = Nf1 /Df1 and rewrite (1.5) as\nf (z) =\n\nF (z)\nzNf1 (z) + c0 Df1 (z)\n=\nzc\u03040 Nf1 (z) + Df1 (z)\nG(z)\n\n(2.9)\n\nfrom which we see that deg Nf \u2264 deg f1 + 1, deg Df \u2264 deg f1 + 1 and thus, deg f \u2264\nN\ndeg f1 + 1. Now let us take f in the form f = Dff and solve equation (1.5) for f1 :\nf1 (z) =\n\n(Nf (z) \u2212 c0 Df (z))/z\nDf (z) \u2212 c\u03040 Nf (z)\n\n(2.10)\n\nSince c0 = f (0) = Nf (0)/Df (0), it follows that the numerator in (2.10) is a polynomial of degree not exceeding deg f \u22121. Therefore, deg Nf1 \u2264 deg f , deg Df1 \u2264 deg f\nand thus, deg f1 \u2264 deg f . This completes the proof of the first statement.\nSince there are only two possibilities for the value of (deg f \u2212 deg f1 ), statements\n(2.7) are equivalent to (2.8). We next observe that the polynomials F and G in (2.9)\ndo not have common zeros (the proof is the same as in Lemma 2.2) and therefore\nwe can conclude from (2.9) that\ndeg f = max{deg F, deg G}.\n\n(2.11)\n\nNow we verify (2.7) (or (2.8)) separately for the following three cases.\nCase 1: Let deg Df1 > deg Nf1 + 1. Then it follows from (2.9) that deg f =\ndeg Df1 = deg f1 and on the other hand, f1 (\u221e) = 0 and f (\u221e) = c0 6= 1/c\u03040 .\nCase 2: Let deg Df1 < deg Nf1 + 1. Then deg f = deg Nf1 + 1 = deg f1 + 1 and\non the other hand, f1 (\u221e) 6= 0 and f (\u221e) = 1/c\u03040 .\nCase 3: Let deg Df1 = deg Nf1 + 1. Let a0 and b0 be the leading coefficients of the\npolynomials Nf1 and Df1 respectively. Then the leading coefficients of F and G are\na0 + c0 b0 and c\u03040 a0 + b0 = 0, respectively. Assuming that deg F < deg Nf1 + 1 and\ndeg G < deg Nf1 +1 we have a0 +c0 b0 = 0 and c\u03040 a0 +b0 = 0 which gives a0 = b0 = 0\nwhich is a contradiction. Therefore, max{deg F, deg G} = deg Nf1 +1 and by (2.11),\ndeg f = deg Nf1 + 1 = deg Df1 = deg f1 . Finally, since deg Df1 = deg Nf1 + 1, we\n\n\f8\n\nVLADIMIR BOLOTNIKOV\n\nhave f1 (\u221e) = 0 and it follows from (2.9) that f (\u221e) =\nto 1/c\u03040 , since b0 6= 0 and |c0 | 6= 1.\n\na0 + c0 b 0\nwhich is not equal\nc\u03040 a0 + b0\n\u0003\n\nLet us apply the backward Schur algorithm (1.6) to a function E \u2208 SRk by\nletting\nfn+1 = E\n\nzfj+1 (z) + \u03b3j\nz\u03b3 j fj+1 (z) + 1\n\nand fj (z) =\n\nfor\n\nj = 0, . . . , n.\n\n(2.12)\n\nLemma 2.3. If deg fi = deg fi+1 + 1, then deg fj = deg fj+1 + 1 for every j < i.\nIf fi (\u221e) = 0, then fj (\u221e) = 0 and deg fj = deg fi for every j > i.\nProof: If deg fi = deg fi+1 + 1, then by virtue of (2.8) (with f , f1 and c\nreplaced respectively by fi , fi+1 and \u03b3i ) we have fi (\u221e) = \u03b31 6= 0. Then again by\ni\n(2.8) (applied to the new triple fi\u22121 , fi and \u03b3i\u22121 ) we get deg fi\u22121 = deg fi + 1 and\ntherefore, fi\u22121 (\u221e) = \u03b3 1 6= 0. The first statement then follows by induction.\ni\u22121\n\nWe now assume that fi (\u221e) = 0. Since fi (\u221e) 6= \u03b31 , we conclude from (2.7) that\ni\nfi+1 (\u221e) = 0 and deg fi+1 = deg fi . The induction argument completes the proof\nof the second statement.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.3: Let f be a solution to the problem RSPn,n , i.e., f is a\nrational Schur-class function of degree at most n satisfying equality (1.1). Then f\nis of the form (1.7) for some rational Schur-class function E or equivalently, f = f0\nis obtained from E = fn via recursion (2.12). Then we necessarily have\ndeg E \u2264 n\n\nand E(\u221e) = 0.\n\n(2.13)\n\nIndeed, deg f \u2265 deg E by Lemma 2.2 and since deg f \u2264 n by the assumption, the\nfirst relation in (2.13) follows. If we assume that E(\u221e) 6= 0, then we get by virtue of\n(2.8), that deg fn\u22121 = deg E + 1 and then we also have deg f = deg E + n + 1 \u2265 n + 1\n(by the first statement in Lemma 2.3) which contradicts the assumption. Thus,\nE(\u221e) = 0. Due to (2.13) we can take E in the form (1.15), i.e., we can let\nNE (z) =\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b2j z\n\nj\n\nand DE (z) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b1j z j .\n\n(2.14)\n\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\nIt remains to show that the coefficients \u03b1i and \u03b2i are related as in (1.16). Observe,\nthat the polynomials An and Bn constructed in (1.12) are of degree at most n;\nwe take them in the form (1.11) so that the reflected polynomials A\u266fn and Bn\u266f (see\n(2.3)) are given by\nA\u266fn (z) =\n\nn\nX\n\nan\u2212j z j\n\nand Bn\u266f (z) =\n\nn\nX\n\nbn\u2212j z j .\n\n(2.15)\n\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\nSubstituting (1.11), (2.14) and (2.15) into (2.5) we get\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nn\u22121\nX n\u2212l\u22121\nX\n\uf8ed\nNf (z) = z n+1 *\n(bn\u2212l\u2212j\u22121 \u03b2n\u2212j\u22121 + al+j+1 \u03b1n\u2212j )\uf8f8 z l + P1 (z),\nl=0\n\nDf (z) = z n+1 *\n\nn\u22121\nX\nl=0\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\nj=0\n\nn\u2212l\u22121\nX\nj=0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(an\u2212l\u2212j\u22121 \u03b2n\u2212j\u22121 + bl+j+1 \u03b1n\u2212j )\uf8f8 z l + P2 (z),\n\n\fLOW DEGREE RATIONAL SOLUTIONS\n\n9\n\nwhere P1 and P2 are polynomials of degree at most n.

Therefore, E can be taken in the form (3.1). Substituting (1.11),\n(2.15) and (3.1) into (2.5) we now get Nf and Df the polynomials of degree at\nmost n + k. Then equating the coefficients of z k+l of these polynomials to zero for\nj = l, . . . , n \u2212 1, we get necessary and sufficient conditions (similar to (2.16) and\n(2.17)) for deg f = max{deg Nf , deg Df } not to exceed k. These conditions are\nmin{n\u2212l\u22121,k}\n\nmin{n\u2212l\u22121,k\u22121}\n\nX\n\nbn\u2212l\u2212j\u22121 \u03b2k\u2212j\u22121 +\n\nmin{n\u2212l\u22121,k}\n\nmin{n\u2212l\u22121,k\u22121}\n\nj=0\n\nal+j+1 \u03b1k\u2212j = 0,\n\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\nX\n\nX\n\nan\u2212l\u2212j\u22121 \u03b2k\u2212j\u22121 +\n\nX\nj=0\n\nbl+j+1 \u03b1k\u2212j = 0\n\n\fLOW DEGREE RATIONAL SOLUTIONS\n\n11\n\n(l = 0, . . . , n) and it is not hard to see that they can be written in the matrix form\n(2.20) as\ne + A\u03b1 = 0 and A\u03b2\ne + B\u03b1 = 0\nB\u03b2\n(3.4)\n\ne and B\ne are the same as in (2.18) and where\nrespectively where the matrices A, B, A\nnow\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03b1k\n\u03b2k\u22121\n\uf8ef .. \uf8fa\n\uf8ef .. \uf8fa\n\uf8ef . \uf8fa\n\uf8ef . \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u03b11 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u03b20 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\u03b1=\uf8ef\n(3.5)\n\uf8ef \u03b10 \uf8fa and \u03b2 = \uf8ef 0 \uf8fa .\n\uf8ef 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef . \uf8fa\n\uf8ef . \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 .. \uf8fb\n\uf8f0 .. \uf8fb\n0\n\n0\n\ne = AA,\ne it follows as in the proof of Theorem 1.3, that \u03b1 and \u03b2 solve\nSince BB\nthe system (3.4) if and only if they are related as in (2.21). Substituting (3.5)\ninto (2.21) and comparing the k top entries in the obtained equality, we get (3.2);\ncomparison of the n \u2212 k bottom entries gives (3.3).\n\u0003\nRemark 3.1. Although Step 4\u2032\u2032 looks very similar to Step 4 in Section 1, in fact it\nis much less efficient. Let us demonstrate this by the case where k = n \u2212 1. Then\ncondition (3.3) takes the form\nr1 \u03b1n\u22121 + r2 \u03b1n\u22122 + . . . + rn\u22121 \u03b11 + rn \u03b10 = 0\n\n(3.6)\n\nand if rn 6= 0, then a0 is uniquely determined by \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n\u22121 . The problem is to\ndescribe all the tuples {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n\u22121 } (which now are the only free parameters) for\nwhich the function\n\u03b20 + \u03b21 z + . . . + \u03b2n\u22122 z n\u22122\n(3.7)\nE(z) =\n\u03b10 + \u03b11 z + . . . + \u03b1n\u22121 z n\u22121\nwith the coefficients \u03b10 , \u03b20 , . . . , \u03b2n\u22122 determined by formulas (3.6) and (3.2) (with\nk = n \u2212 1), belongs to the Schur class. The problem is hard; at the moment we\neven do not know necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of at least\none such tuple.\nReferences\n1. A. C. Antoulas and B. D. O.
