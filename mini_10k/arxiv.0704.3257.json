CO observations have been so far the best way to trace molecular gas in external galaxies, but in low metallicity environments\nthe gas mass deduced could be largely underestimated due to enhanced photodissociation of the CO molecule. Large envelopes of H2\ncould therefore be missed by CO observations.\nAims. At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are used to estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the\nmolecular clouds. Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and could unveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These\ndifferent tracers must be compared in different environments.\nMethods. This study compares virial masses to masses deduced from millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular\nclouds in our Galaxy (104 \u2013105 M\u2299), and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the nearest low metallicity\ndwarf galaxy.\nResults. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deduced from millimeter (FIRAS) emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma\nray analysis (Grenier et al. 2005) and therefore trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses are systematically larger (twice on\naverage) than mass estimates from millimeter dust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has already been\nreported in previous studies. This is not the case for SMC giant molecular clouds: molecular cloud masses deduced from SIMBA\nmillimeter observations are systematically higher (twice on average for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity)\nthan the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can not be accounted for by any plausible change of dust\nproperties. Taking a general form for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of \u223c 15\u03bcG in SMC clouds could\nprovide additional support to the clouds and explain the difference observed.\nConclusions. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have so far been underestimated. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly to\ntheir support.\nKey words. ISM: clouds - submillimeter - ISM: molecules - Magellanic Clouds - ISM: magnetic fields\n\n1. Introduction\nMolecular clouds are of particular importance as the sites of star\nformation in a galaxy. Most of this gas is located in large complexes known as giant molecular clouds (GMCs), but the exact amount of gas contained remains unknown since H2 is quite\nimpossible to observe directly in cold interstellar regions where\nmolecules form and survive.\nCarbon monoxyde (CO) has played a major role in GMC\nstudies and is still the most widely used tracer of molecular\ngas. However, it could be present only in the densest parts\nof molecular clouds, leaving H2 envelopes unseen. This effect\nhas been clearly observed in Molecular Clouds of the Solar\nNeighbourhood (Grenier et al. 2005) and tends to underestimate\nmolecular cloud masses estimated from CO observations. This\nbias is most important in low metallicity environments where\nthe reduced shielding causes CO to be confined to tiny dense\nSend offprint requests to: C. Bot\n\nstructures (Andr\u00e9 et al. 2004). Most of the mass may then lie in\nthe cloud envelopes where the gas is molecular due to H2 selfshielding but CO is photodissociated (Israel 2005; Lequeux et al.\n1994). Millimeter dust emission could bring to light the total\nmass of such clouds.\nThe advent of sensitive bolometer arrays on submillimeter/millimeter telescopes makes long wavelength\ndust emission an alternative to CO to compute molecular\nmasses. The good correlation with CO emission in CO\nbright galaxies (e.g. NGC891 Guelin et al. (1993), NGC6946\nAlton et al. (2002)) asserts its association with molecular gas.\nMore generally existing observations show that sub-millimeter\ndust emission from galaxies traces the total hydrogen column\ndensity (Thomas et al. 2002; Meijerink et al. 2005). It complements the Hi and CO observations to provide a complete view\nof cold interstellar matter.\nWe propose to use dust continuum emission at millimeter\nwavelengths to compute molecular clouds masses in two sam-\n\n\f2\n\nC. Bot et al.: mm dust emission unveilling the true mass of SMC GMCs\n\nples of GMCs: molecular clouds in the Solar neighbourhood, and\ncounterparts in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The SMC\nis a nearby irregular dwarf galaxy (D\u2248 61kpc; Laney & Stobie\n(1994)) known to have a low metallicity (Z\u2248Z\u2299 /10, Dufour\n(1984)) and giant star forming regions. While the amount of\nmolecular material observed via CO emission is low, numerous young stars are observed. Furthermore, galaxy counts behind the SMC imply extinctions much larger than expected from\nthe column density of atomic hydrogen (Lequeux 1994). Thus\nthe SMC is a good candidate to detect extended envelopes of H2\ngas through dust observations.\nFrom the comparison of GMCs CO luminosity and virial\nmass, the SMC XCO = N(H2 )/ICO conversion factor is estimated to be 10 times the Galactic value (Rubio et al. 1993a;\nMizuno et al. 2001). This virial calibration of XCO should take\ninto account the cloud mass in the CO-poor H2 gas, but dust observations question this view. Lisenfeld et al. (2002) inferred a\nXCO conversion factor 25 to 30 times higher than the Galactic\nvalue by comparing sub-millimeter dust and CO emission from\nthe low metallicity dwarf galaxy NGC1569. Rubio et al. (2004)\nreported the detection of the millimeter dust emission from\nSMCB1#1 with SIMBA/SEST. They converted the flux into a\ncloud mass estimate that is found to be one order of magnitude larger than its CO virial mass. Leroy et al. (2006) analysed\nSpitzer far infrared maps in the SMC, in conjunction with Hi and\nCO observations. Comparing the 160\u03bcm map to NANTEN CO\nobservations they estimate XCO to be 60 times the Galactic value.\nThis present study follows and continues the work of Rubio et al.\n(2004) by analysing a larger number of molecular clouds in the\nSMC and by analysing these clouds together with a reference\nsample that we build in our Galaxy. As such it is the first comprehensive comparison of two giant molecular cloud mass estimates\nat different metallicities: gas masses from dust millimeter emission and virial masses. Are the dust and virial mass estimates\nin agreement? If they are discrepant, how can the difference be\nexplained?\nAfter an overview of the data used in this study (Sect. 2),\nmolecular gas masses from dust millimeter emission are computed for a sample of Local GMCs and for detected SMC GMCs\n(Sect. 3.1). A comparison to virial mass estimates is performed\nin Sect. 3.2 and the differences are interpreted in Sect. 4\n\n2. The data\nThis study follows the detection of several molecular clouds at\n1.2 mm in the SMC with the SIMBA bolometer. We present\nthese new observations in details, along with previously published data.\n2.1. SEST observations in the SMC\n2.1.1. CO observations\n\nThe CO observations of the SMC clouds were observed\nas part of the ESO/SEST Key Programme on CO in the\nMagellanic Clouds (Israel et al. 1993; Rubio et al. 1993a,b,\n1996; Israel et al. 2003). The motivation for undertaking these\nobservations in the transitions J=(1-0) and J=(2-1) of the CO\nmolecule, and the reduction treatments are described in these\npapers. We just recall here the spatial resolution: the beam has a\nFWHM of 43\u2032\u2032 and 22\u2032\u2032 at the CO(1-0) and the CO(2-1) frequencies respectively. Since CO(2-1) line data has better resolution,\ngas masses computed for the CO(2-1) emitting regions will be\nfavored when CO(2-1) observations were performed. In the fol-\n\nTable 1.

SIMBA millimeter continuum observations\n\nThe SIMBA bolometer was mounted at the Swedish ESO\nSubmillimeter Telescope (SEST). It operated at a central frequency of 250 GHz (1.2 mm) with a FWHM bandwidth of 90\nGHz, and an angular resolution of 24\u2032\u2032 on the sky. The individual maps were produced using the fast scanning mode. The\nelimination of the correlated sky noise, adding of the individual\nmaps, and the photometry were done using the MOPSI package1 . The \u03c4zenith was determined performing skydips on average\n2 hours during the day, and every 3 hours during the night. The\nflux determination was done for each individual observing run\nby taking maps of Uranus. The data reduction was performed as\ndescribed in the SIMBA User manual2 . The flux measurements\nin the final coadded map has an uncertainty of 15%.\nThe millimeter dust emission in the SMC is faint and\nthe regions unambigously detected are giant molecular clouds\n(GMCs) (see Fig.1). Most of them have been observed in CO and\nare named according to Rubio et al. (1993a,b) or Henize (1956).\nSIMBA fluxes for each region are displayed in Table 1. They are\nmeasured for a SIMBA beam convolved to 27\u2032\u2032 and within the\n25 mJy/beam contour, after subtraction of the flux measured in\nan empty zone.\nDetected sources: Detected GMCs are often associated with\n\nwell-known H ii regions and young clusters and all but LIRS49\ncorrespond to absorption patches (Hodge 1974). We review here\nsome of their properties:\n\u2013 LIRS49 and LIRS36 are two of the most prominent SMC\nsources in the far-infrared (Schwering & Israel 1989) and\na large variety of molecular species have been observed\nin these directions (Chin et al. 1998; Heikkila et al. 1998).\nLIRS49 may be a superposition of two H ii regions belonging to different kinematical complexes along the line of sight\n(Rosado et al. 1994) or it could be associated with a bubble\nor a loop (Meyssonnier & Azzopardi 1993).\n\u2013 SMCB1#1 and Hodge15 are two quiescent molecular clouds\n(not associated with H\u03b1). The SIMBA millimeter observa1\nMOPSI is a data reduction software package for IR and radio data\ndevelopped by R.

SIMBA mosaic of the south of the SMC (left panel). Names of the star forming regions studied in this paper are labeled\ncloseby. On the right panel, CO contours of the studied regions are displayed on the same grid (with plain lines when CO(2-1) is\navailable, with mixed lines for CO(1-0) data).\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\ntions of SMCB1#1 were used by Rubio et al. (2004) to deduce a cloud mass.\nSMCB1#2 and SMCB1#3 are parts of the SMC-B1 region of\nRubio et al. (1993b) and are associated with large H ii regions.\nThe SMCB2 region contains several molecular clouds observed by Rubio et al. (1993a). Since these clouds are difficult to separate in the continuum dust emission which has\nno velocity information, they were grouped into two complexes: SMCB2 North (corresponds to SMCB2#3 and #4\nof Rubio et al. (1993a)) and SMCB2 South (which corresponds to SMCB2#1, #2 and #6). The SMCB2#5 region of\nRubio et al. (1993a) is not detected at 1.2mm with SIMBA.\nMillimeter emission is also detected toward the N30 and N11\n(Henize 1956) H ii regions, but these regions have not yet\nbeen mapped in CO, so no mass comparison can be done for\nthese objects. For N30, the SIMBA flux can be accounted for\nentirely by free-free emission.\nThe source identified by the question mark in Fig. 1 (between SMCB2 North and South) does not correspond to any\npresently known source. It is clearly detected at the 6\u03c3 level\nbut there is no associated infrared or radio component. It\nshould be noted however that it lies on an extended component seen at 70\u03bcm with Spitzer observations and it is close\nto the DEM S43 H ii region. Further observations are needed\nto understand the nature of this source.\n\nThe observed regions correspond to different evolutionary\nstages of molecular clouds \u2013 from quiescent clouds to evolved\nmassive star forming regions\u2013, enabling us to compare CO and\ndust mass estimates in different physical conditions.\nOrigin of millimeter continuum emission: The emission mea-\n\nsured at 1.2 mm consists of several components: thermal dust\nemission, free-free radiation and 12 CO(2-1) line emission. Since\nour interest is only in cold dust emission, we estimate the other\ncontributions that have to be removed.\n\nCO line emission: The 12 CO(2-1) line contribution to the\nSIMBA surface brightness can be estimated as follows:\nFline =\n\n2k\u03bd3 c\u22123\n\u03a9 ICO(2\u22121) ,\n\u2206\u03bdbol\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ICO(2\u22121) is the intensity of the 12 CO(2-1) line in K.km.s\u22121\n, \u2206\u03bdbol is the bandwidth of the SIMBA bolometer (90 GHz),\n\u03a9 is the region of integration, k is the Boltzmann constant and\n\u03bd = 230 GHz. For regions where CO(2-1) (Rubio et al. 1993b,a,\n1996; Israel et al. 2003) has been observed, the total flux density\ndue to line contributions was evaluated (see Table 1) and was\nfound to be negligible.\nfree-free emission: The contribution of the continuum emission due to thermal electrons can be estimated with radio continuum data, assuming pure free-free emission at high frequencies\nand extrapolating this frequency dependence to 1.2 mm (250\nGHz) 3 . We also assume that radio emission is optically thin\nat long frequencies. We used the ATCA continuum catalog of\nthe SMC radio sources (Payne et al. 2004) at 1.42, 2.37, 4.8 and\n8.64 GHz. In both SIMBA and ATCA observations, extended\nemission on scales larger than a given threshold is filtered out.\nFor SIMBA, extended emission on scales larger than \u223c 2\u2032 is filtered out when subtracting the sky emission. The interferometric\nATCA observations are not corrected for missing short spacing\nand do not measure emission on spatial scales larger than about\nhalf the size of the primary lobe. At 8.64 GHz, the two angular\nscales are comparable. Radio emission comes both from freefree and synchrotron emission but at these high frequencies it is\ndominated by free-free. We estimate the free-free contribution\nby extrapolating the 8.64 GHz radio flux when available, since\nit is the less synchrotron biased frequency of this catalog and\nalso the resolution is the closest to the SIMBA one. When no\n8.64 GHz flux is relevant, we take the longest frequency available and follow the same procedure: for LIRS49, the free-free\ncontribution is extrapolated from the 2.37 GHz flux; for SMCB2\n3\n\nFor electron temperatures typical of Hii regions (\u223c 104 K), the freefree emission scales as (0.95 \u2212 0.16 ln \u03bd) where \u03bd is in GHz (Reynolds\n1992)\n\n\f4\n\nC. Bot et al.: mm dust emission unveilling the true mass of SMC GMCs\n\nNorth and South region it is obtained from the 4.8 GHz fluxes.\nIt should be kept in mind in these cases that the free-free contribution could be overestimated, a bias that would reinforce the\nresult (see section 4).\ndust emission associated with neutral atomic gas Hi. In the\nSMC, the resolution of Hi observations does not allow an estimate of the contribution of the SIMBA flux that is associated\nwith neutral gas. However, most of this emission is spatially extended and filtered out in the subtraction of the sky emission.\nFor each source, dust emission is the major component of the\n1.2mm flux. In the following, we shall refer to the SIMBA flux\ntabulated in Table 1 as the flux measured at 1.2 mm subtracted\nfrom the gas contribution estimates.\n2.2. FIRAS and CO data in our Galaxy\n\nTo complement the analysis of SMC clouds, we use FIRAS spectra and the CO (1-0) sky survey from Dame et al. (2001) for\na sample of Local GMCs defined in rectangular (l, b) boxes4:\nOrion, Taurus, Ophiuchus, Cepheus, Chamaeleon, Lupus and\nPerseus. The 7o FIRAS beam for these clouds at a few hundreds\nof parsecs and the SIMBA beam at the distance of the SMC correspond to similar linear spatial resolutions.\n2.2.1. Millimeter fluxes\n\nThe 1.2mm fluxes were derived by fitting the FIRAS spectra at\n\u03bb > 500\u03bcm with a black body multiplied by a power law emissivity. The temperatures in Table 2 were derived from a single\ntemperature fit of the full FIRAS spectra down to 150\u03bcm and\nan emissivity index of 2. As for the SIMBA observations, the\n1.2mm emission observed toward the Galactic molecular clouds\noriginate from different components other than cold dust emission. We try to estimate their contribution to the 1.2mm flux.\nThe CO(2-1) line emission contribution is difficult to estimate without CO(2-1) data on hand. However, since brightness temperatures are the same in CO J=2-1 and J=1-0 lines,\nthe Dame et al. (2001) survey can be used to estimate this contribution. Using a ICO(J=2\u22121) /ICO(J=1\u22120) = 0.6 for the Solar\nNeighborhood (Hasegawa 1996), this contribution is found to\nbe negligeable.\nFree-free emission: extinction corrected-H\u03b1 emission\n(Dickinson et al. 2003) is used to estimate the free-free emission\ncontribution to the FIRAS fluxes. This is found to be very low\n(< 3%) and is therefore negligeable.\nDust emission associated with neutral atomic gas. Unlike\nthe SIMBA observations, the FIRAS data measures the total Galactic emission. Part of this emission comes from\ndust associated with the diffuse medium. We used the\nLeiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) Hi survey of Kalberla et al.\n(2005) to estimate the proportion of millimeter emission associated with neutral gas. At high galactic latitude, the dust millimeter emission is well correlated with Hi column densities\n(Boulanger et al. 1996). The dust emission per H atom is combined with the Hi column densities measured in the cloud areas\nto compute and subtract the 1.2mm flux associated with neutral gas. Their contribution amounts to about 40% of the total\nFIRAS flux at 1.2mm. The 1.2 mm fluxes obtained are listed\nin Table 2 for each cloud. To estimate the uncertainties associated with the dust emission removal, we defined for each cloud\na reference area of similar size on the symetric position within\n4\n\nThe box were defined on the millimeter emission map\n\nthe Galaxy (same longitude, opposite latitude) and subtract the\nflux observed in the reference regions from the one observed in\nthe molecular clouds. The differences observed are similar to the\nuncertainties on the data quoted in Table 2\n2.2.2. CO emission\n\nWe use the CO(1-0) survey of Dame et al. (2001) of the Galaxy\nto compute the size and velocity dispersion of each cloud over\nthe same areas as the millimeter emission observations. To be\nconsistent with CO information in the SMC, we chose to compute the size and the velocity dispersion of each cloud in a similar way (e.g no correction for velocity gradients). For each cloud,\nwe fit each spectrum above a certain level and sum the gaussian fits to deduce a total cloud spectrum. The velocity dispersion of the cloud is determined by fitting a gaussian to the resulting spectrum. This method is close to what was used for\nthe SMC except that some SMC clouds were divided into substructures when independent clouds were separated in spatialvelocity space. We checked that this difference in method for\nsome clouds does not induce a significant bias in the cloud parameters. The radius and velocity dispersions are listed in Table\n2 for each cloud. Because there is insufficient spatial resolution\nto correct for velocity gradients in the SMC clouds, we chose not\nto correct for them in the Galactic sample either. We are careful\nto apply the same method to deduce virial masses in both data\nsets.\n\n3. Estimates of molecular cloud masses\n3.1. Molecular gas mass from millimeter continuum emission\n\nDust millimeter continuum emission is associated with molecular gas. In this section, we compute molecular cloud masses from\nthe dust emission at 1.2mm.\nThe far-infrared/millimeter emission from dust can be expressed as:\nI\u03bb = NH \u01ebH (\u03bb)B\u03bb(T dust )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere NH is the hydrogen column density of the cloud, \u01ebH (\u03bb)\nis the emissivity of dust per hydrogen atom at the wavelength \u03bb\nand T dust is the dust temperature. The emissivity per hydrogen\natom can be expressed in terms of the absorption coefficient per\nunit dust mass \u03ba(\u03bb):\n\u01ebH (\u03bb) = \u03ba(\u03bb)xd \u03bcmH\n\n(3)\n\nwhere xd is the dust-to-gas mass ratio, and \u03bcmH is the gas weight\nper H, taking into account the contribution of He. This emissivity may be determined empirically from the correlation between\ndust and gas observations, independently of any dust model (e.g\nBoulanger et al. (1996) for the diffuse interstellar medium in the\nSolar Neighborhood).\nWhile dust temperatures for the Galactic clouds have been\ndeduced from the FIRAS spectra fitting , this information is not\navailable for the clouds in the SMC. Since we wish to apply the\nsame method for both samples, we will fix the dust temperature for both samples. Within each cloud, dust is present over\na range of temperatures. The fit of FIRAS spectra with a single temperature gives higher weight to the warmer dust present\nat the cloud surface or near embedded stars. But in a molecular\ncloud, the bulk of the mass is shielded from UV radiation. The\ndust temperature in the shielded parts of the clouds is observed\nto be smaller than the values in Table 2. For example, based on\n\n\fC. Bot et al.: mm dust emission unveilling the true mass of SMC GMCs\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

(2003) report a dust\ntemperature of 12 K for a Taurus filament. To conservatively estimate cloud masses, we adopt a dust temperature of 15 K (the\nminimum value of the FIRAS temperatures listed in Table 2)\nto derive Galactic and SMC cloud masses from their millimeter\ndust fluxes.\nWe assume that the dust grain opacity per unit mass is the\nsame for the SMC and Milky Way molecular clouds. Therefore,\nthe emissivity per hydrogen atom scales as the dust-to-gas mass\nratio. Knowing the SMC dust-to-gas mass ratio and the Galactic\ndust emissivity per hydrogen atom in the SMC, the millimeter emission can therefore be translated into a gas amount. The\nGalactic emissivity per hydrogen atom is adopted for dust associated with molecular gas (see Appendix A): \u01ebHre f (1.2mm, H2) =\n(1.2 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 10\u221226 at\u22121 .cm2 . For the SMC, this emissivity\nwill be reduced by one sixth to account for the difference in\ndust-to-gas ratio with respect to the Solar Neighbourhood (see\nAppendix B). The values of dust emissivity per hydrogen atom\nwe use, correspond to absorption coefficient per unit mass of\n\u03ba = 0.72cm2.g\u22121 , 3 times higher than the standard value from\nDraine & Lee (1984). Furthermore, the dust-to-gas ratio in the\nSMC could be as much as 5 times smaller (Bot et al. 2004). The\nmass estimates we deduce from millimeter emission in the SMC\nare therefore upper limits. These choices were made to emphasize the robustness of the results of this study, but the range of\nparameters available for the dust emissivity and dust-to-gas ratio\nis assessed throughout the paper (see Sec. 4 and Fig. 2).\nWe can thus translate the measured millimeter fluxes of the\nclouds into their corresponding hydrogen column densities and\nmolecular cloud masses. The results for the Solar Neighborhood\nand the SMC clouds are presented in tables 3 and 4 respectively.\nNote that we used an emissivity per unit dust mass and a dustto-gas ratio that are 1.8 and 1.7 times higher, respectively, than\nthe one used by Rubio et al. (2004).\n3.2. Comparison to virial masses\n\nIn both data sets, the kinematic and spatial information provided\nby the CO data cube enables the determination of virial masses.\nFor this determination, we use the simplified formulation for a\n1/r density law from MacLaren et al. (1988):\nMvir (M\u2299 ) = 190\u2206V 2 (km.s\u22121 )R(pc) =\n\n9\u03c32 R\n2G\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u2206V is the observed velocity dispersion from the CO\nlinewidth (FWHM) and R is the radius of the cloud. The virial\nmasses for both cloud samples are computed using the radius\n\nTable 3.

For the SMC, these parameters were taken from the litterature (c.f. Sec. 2.1.1). For the\nGalactic clouds, the radius and velocity dispersion were computed as described in Sec. 2.2.2, in order to be consistent with\nthe SMC values. The results for Galactic and SMC clouds are\npresented in tables 3 and 4 respectively.\nRosolowsky & Leroy (2006) have shown that spatial resolution and sensitivity differences in molecular-line data cubes can\nsignificantly affect the measured sizes and line widths that are\nused to deduce virial masses of giant molecular clouds. In the\npresent study, the linear spatial resolution of the SEST CO(21) data in the SMC and of the CO(1-0) data from Dame et al.\n(2001) in the solar neighbourhood are similar. Bias arising from\nlow resolution should therefore affect the SMC and Galactic\nsample in the same way. This offset may be more problematic\nwhen no CO(2-1) data was available for some clouds in the SMC\nand CO(1-0) data with larger resolution (\u223c 13pc) was used instead. However, the results we obtain in these cases are not significantly different that the results obtained with higher resolu-\n\n\f6\n\nC.

However, the characteristics of the\nclouds were computed for substructures and the masses of\nthe substructures were then added. We have compared our\nvirial mass estimates with those of the litterature for the same\nclouds. We observe minor differences that reflect the different\ndefinitions in the extent of the clouds and the difference in the\nmethod used (velocity gradients, substructure divisions).\n\n4. Results\nTables 3 and 4 give mass estimates for the clouds in our Galaxy\nand in the SMC, computed from millimeter observations of dust\nemission and from virial estimates. These two estimates of the\ngas mass of a cloud are compared through the ratio of these\nmasses, f = MM1.2mm\n.\nvir\nWe observe a systematic difference between the two mass\nestimates: in our Galaxy, the molecular cloud masses deduced\nfrom millimeter emission are systematically lower than the\nvirial masses obtained from CO observations, while in the SMC\nthe mass deduced from millimeter emission are systematically\nlarger. This difference is best seen in Fig.2.\n4.1. In the Galaxy\n\nThe comparison of the virial mass and the gas mass deduced\nfrom millimeter emission in the local Galactic clouds shows that\nthe virial mass is always larger than the mass from millimeter\nemission, with a mean f factor of 0.5.\n\nGrenier et al. (2005) analysed \u03b3 ray emission in Giant molecular clouds of the Solar Neighborhood and found that a significant part of the mass of large molecular clouds is not traced by\nCO emission. We compared our mass estimates to their masses\nof \"dark gas\" (interpreted as H2 without CO) for the same regions. We find that the cloud masses deduced from millimeter\ndust emission are fully compatible with the total masses of the\nclouds (the \"dark gas\" plus molecular gas traced by CO emission). However, for the regions chosen in this study, the fraction\nof \"dark gas\" with respect to the total molecular gas is low.\nSolomon et al. (1987) compared, for a large sample of giant\nmolecular clouds in our Galaxy, the virial mass of the clouds to\ntheir CO luminosity. They observed a good correlation between\nboth quantities that can be transformed into a relation between\nthe mass deduced from CO emission and the virial mass. Since\nin the studied regions the masses deduced from CO emission\nare close to the masses deduced from millimeter dust emission,\nthis law can then be compared to our mass estimates for the\nGalactic clouds (see Fig. 2). For the Galactic clouds, the millimeter and CO masses are consistent for the Galactic gamma\nray calibration of XCO = 1.8 * 1020 mol.cm\u22122.(K.km.s\u22121 )\u22121 . For\nthis factor, the Solomon et al. (1987) virial mass-LCO relation\nshow that the virial mass is larger than the cloud mass by a factor decreasing toward high masses (see Fig. 2). This trend was\nalso observed for clumps within GMCs by numerous studies\nin our Galaxy (Bertoldi & McKee 1992; Williams et al. 1995;\nHeyer et al. 2001; Simon et al. 2001). In the Galaxy, the f factor is observed to be 1 only for the most massive Galactic GMCs\nwith masses larger than 5*105 M\u2299 (Dame et al. 1986). For clumps\nwithin large gravitationally bound clouds the weight of the overlying material in the cloud could provide significant binding\npressure for the clumps (Bertoldi & McKee 1992).\n4.2. In the SMC\n\nThe comparison of gas masses obtained from the millimeter dust\nemission with the virial masses shows a systematic bias in the\nSMC. Gas masses deduced from the millimeter emission are 1.8\ntimes higher on average than the virial masses. The factor f =\nM1.2mm\nMvir ranges from 0.9 to 3.1 (see Table 4). The mass discrepancy\nreported for SMCB1#1 by Rubio et al. (2004) is thus a general\nresult that must be understood.\nFor the computation of masses from the millimeter flux, we\nused a dust temperature of 15 K for all the clouds. Could a\nhigher temperature in the molecular cloud of the SMC explain\nthe difference observed in mass? For agreement between the\nvirial mass and the mass from millimeter dust emission to agree,\nthe dust temperature within the molecular gas would have to be\n23 K on average. But if the molecular clouds of the SMC were\nwarm, they would emit in the far infrared. While for most of the\nregions surveyed here, the Spitzer 160\u03bcm emission (Leroy et al.\n2006) is biased toward the Hii region emission present in the\nbeam, this is not the case for the quiescent molecular cloud\nSMCB1#1. Comparing millimeter fluxes with Spitzer data in\nSMCB1#1 gives a dust temperature of 11, 14 or 17 K for spectral indices of 2, 1.5 and 1, respectively. This shows that at least\nin a quiescent cloud (and presumably in all molecular clouds) a\nhigher dust temperature in the molecular clouds of the SMC is\nnot compatible with the far-infrared data and can not explain the\ndifference observed between the mass estimates.\nFurthermore, the cloud masses deduced from dust millimeter emission depend on the dust-to-gas ratio and the emissivity\nof dust grains in the SMC molecular clouds. The values we used\n\n\fC. Bot et al.: mm dust emission unveilling the true mass of SMC GMCs\n\nfor these parameters were chosen to limit the mass of the clouds\nand thus reduce the discrepancy with virial masses. In the diffuse\nISM of the SMC, the dust emissivity per hydrogen atom is measured to be 1/30 the emissivity of the Galactic diffuse medium\n(Bot et al. 2004). For the molecular clouds of the SMC, we used\na larger emissivity to account both for grain coagulation effects\n(twice the diffuse medium value) and for our estimate of the\nSMC dust-to-gas ratio (twice larger than the canonical value for\nthe metallicity of the SMC, c.f. Appendix B). Not only it is not\nclear if grain coagulation (grain emissivity enhancement by mass\nunit) occurs in the SMC, but we assume that heavy elements depletions are the same in the SMC and Galactic molecular clouds\nwhile they are observed to be smaller in the SMC diffuse ISM.\nIn that sense, we consider the millimeter mass estimates in Table\n4 to be lower limits on the molecular cloud masses. Lower depletions and thereby lower dust emissivity per hydrogen atom\nwill enlarge the mass discrepancy. The range of masses obtained\nfor each cloud, for dust emissivities ranging from 1/6 to 1/20 the\nGalactic molecular value, is shown in Fig. 2. Since it is dynamically difficult to account for a large difference between the cloud\nmass and its virial estimation, a first conclusion of this paper is\nthat SMC dust observations imply a significant (up to a factor\n\u223c 5) increase in the dust-to-gas mass ratio from the diffuse ISM\nto molecular clouds. The dust which is destroyed by shocks in\nthe diffuse ISM is rebuilt in molecular clouds. A second conclusion is that even with conservative assumptions on the dust\nemissivity per hydrogen atom, the virial mass is found to be systematically lower than the millimeter gas mass.\n\n5. Generalized virial theorem\nIn the SMC, molecular cloud masses from millimeter dust emission are systematically larger than the virial masses. We saw\nabove that uncertainties on the mass estimates from dust emission can not explain such differences. Observational estimates of\nthe velocity dispersion are obtained through the CO line width.\nThe lack of resolution and sensitivity of the observations certainly plays a role on the virial mass computations. However, the\nobservational bias on the Galactic and the SMC sample should\nbe similar and we were careful to apply the same analysis, so we\nare confident that the virial mass discrepancy in the SMC does\nnot arise from observational uncertainties.\nLeroy et al. (2006) studied dust emission in the far-infrared\nin the SMC and showed that excesses with respect to Hi are\nobserved to extend farther than CO emission observed with\nNANTEN. This difference is attributed to molecular hydrogen\nnot traced by CO and amounts to 30% in spatial coverage. The\nCO and SIMBA observations we use for the SMC clouds certainly underestimate the size of the giant molecular clouds due to\nsensitivity effects. As a result, the masses measured in this study\nare characteristics of clumps within the clouds smaller than the\none from the Leroy et al. (2006) study. However, the size of the\nclouds that are detected with SIMBA and CO observations (see\nFig. 1) in our study are about the same, so that the effect of any\nbiases in the cloud radius should not be large enough to affect\nour results.\nThe mass discrepancy observed between the SMC and\nGalactic clouds might indicate that the CO line width underestimates the amplitude of the cloud turbulent motions. This interpretation was proposed by Rubio et al. (2004). In the SMC\nclouds, the CO emission is expected to come from dense clumps\nembedded in lower density gas where CO is photo-dissociated\n(Lequeux et al. 1994). The bulk of the cloud mass is in the lower\ndensity gas but the CO line width only measures the velocity dis-\n\n7\n\npersion of the clumps. The same statement applies locally to the\nless massive high Galactic latitude clouds where CO line widths\nare observed to be systematically lower than the Hi line width.\nQuantitatively, in the Ursa Major high latitude cloud, on scales\nof 5-10 pc, the Hi velocity dispersion is observed to be twice\nthat of CO (de Vries et al. 1987). It is not clear to us whether\nthis observed difference can be simply extrapolated to the more\nmassive SMC clouds that are gravitationally bound. However,\nit has been theoretically suggested that in gravitationnal bound\nclouds the gas velocity dispersion should increase as the density decreases (Fatuzzo & Adams 1993; McKee 1999). In this\nsection, we present an alternative interpretation where the mass\ndifference results from the contribution of the magnetic field to\nthe clouds support.\nIn this section, we inspect the assumptions made for the\nvirial mass calculations, searching for those which could cause\na systematic underestimation of the mass. In particular, the presence of a magnetic field in the molecular clouds could help to\nbalance gravity and we will compute the necessary strength to\nexplain the mass ratio f observed in the SMC.\nTo apply the virial theorem, molecular clouds should be virialized. Observationally determined dynamical parameters enable us to define the characteristic time scale of these clouds:\nR/\u2206V. Clouds younger than this characteristic time didn't have\ntime to be virialized and the virial theorem can not apply. This\ncharacteristic time scale for the SMC clouds is \u223c 3 * 106 years.\nIt is therefore possible that these clouds did not have time to\nbe virialized. One possibility would be that, unlike Galactic giant molecular clouds, in the SMC CO observations only traces\nclouds collapsing into stars on the timescale of a few million\nyears (free-fall time). But this interpretation does not fit with the\nfact that two clouds, SMCB1#1 and Hodge15, have no associated Hii.\nIn this study, virial masses were determined using the simplified form from MacLaren et al. (1988). This form neglects\namong others the surface pressure and the magnetic field terms.\nThe general virial equilibrium equation for a cloud in a steady\nstate can be written as:\n0 = 2(T \u2212 T0 ) + M + W\n\n(5)\n\n(McKee & Zweibel 1992) where T is the total kinetic energy\n(due to thermal and global motions), T0 represents the confinement by external thermal pressure, M is the magnetic energy\nand W is the gravitational energy. The gravitational energy can\nbe expressed as:\n3 GM 2\nW=\u2212 a\n5 R\n\n(6)\n\nwhere G is the gravitationnal constant and a measure departures\nfrom uniform density and sphericity (Bertoldi & McKee 1992).\nMcKee & Zweibel (1992) introduced the virial parameter\n2T\n\u03b1 = a |W|\nso that the mass of a cloud is expressed as:\nM=\n\n5\u03c32 R\n.\n\u03b1G\n\n(7)\n\nIf we take M1.2mm as the true gas mass of the cloud, understanding the high values of f = M1.2mm /Mvir amounts to looking\nfor low values of the virial parameters (with f = 10/9\u03b1), which\nis equivalent to solving:\nh\ni\n10 1 \u2212 (P0 /P)\nf =\n.\n(8)\n9a [1 \u2212 (M/|W|)]\n\n\f8\n\nC.

Since\nexternal pressure (high P0 ) acts in lowering f and the effects of\ndensity and geometry are mild, we will only discuss the effects\nof magnetic field support in the SMC giant molecular clouds.\n5.1. Magnetic field support in clouds.\n\nFrom the observed characteristics of the molecular clouds, we\ncan compute the magnetic-to-gravitational energy ratio needed\nto explain the f factors. Taking the case of a spherical uniform\ncloud with steady motions and a mean pressure exceeding the\nsurface pressure (P\u0304 >> P0 ), one obtains M/|W| = 1 \u2212 910f . The\nobtained values are displayed in Table 5 .\nTaking M = 16 (B2 \u2212 B20 )R3 , one can express the strength of\nthe magnetic field that is necessary to account for the f values:\n!\n10 GM 2\n18\n2\n2\n1\u2212\nB \u2212 B0 =\n(9)\n5\n9 f R4\nwhere B0 is the ambient medium value of the magnetic field\nstrength. Taking B0 = 5\u03bcG (5) , the magnetic field strength necessary to support the clouds is computed and displayed in Table\n5. They range from \u223c 10 to \u223c 30 \u03bcG, with a mean value of\n\u2248 15 \u03bcG. Such strengths are similar to the values reported for\nsome Galactic clouds (Myers & Goodman 1988) but the clumps\nsurveyed are much smaller and confined by the pressure, not\nby their self-gravity (Bertoldi & McKee 1992). Recently, a magnetic field with a similar strength (\u223c 20\u03bcG) has been observed in\nthe outer part of the Taurus molecular cloud (Wolleben & Reich\n2004).\nSo magnetic field support of the molecular clouds could explain the mass difference observed in the SMC. But why would\nthe magnetic field support be important for the SMC molecular\nclouds and not for the Galactic ones? Molecular cloud formation could be different in the SMC. Giant molecular clouds in\nspiral galaxies are thought to form in spiral arms where the low\nshear and high gas density allows gravity to gather diffuse matter over large scales. Matter may preferentially condense along\nfield lines without compressing the magnetic field. We refer to\nRosolowsky et al. (2003) for a discussion of observational constraints on proposed formation scenarios based on a survey of\nmolecular clouds in M33. In an irregular galaxy like the SMC,\nmassive stars have an important impact on the structure of the interstellar medium and molecular clouds may form out of shells\nblown by stellar winds and supernovae explosions. In the Spitzer\ninfrared images (Bolatto et al. 2006), the molecular clouds in\n5\n\nconsistent with Pohl (1993) model; note that this choice does not\nreally influence the result as long as the mean SMC magnetic field remains low, which we have no reason to doubt\n\nFig. 1 do appear as local peaks along a large shell of 300pc diameter. In this picture, the magnetic field is expected to be swept\ntogether with the matter. It is also possible that the lower metallicity and therefore the lower dust content in the SMC creates\nlower dust opacity in the GMCs of the SMC than in our Galaxy.\nThe ionization could therefore be higher in the SMC, supporting\nhigher magnetic fields. Another possibility is that magnetic field\nsupport is important also in the Galactic molecular clouds and\nvirial masses could have to be re-examined taking into account\na magnetic field support on large scales. In this case, it would\nbe interesting to see if the larger external pressure that will be\nrequired for the virial mass to match the other mass estimates\n(from \u03b3 ray analysis for example) is compatible with observations. Answering these questions are beyond the scope of this\npaper but will can be addressed in the future. In any case, magnetic field observations (e.g through Zeeman effect) can be used\nto confirm the magnetic field strength in these regions.\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe compared two different molecular gas tracers, the millimeter dust emission and the virial theorem applied to CO observations, at two different metallicities: our Galaxy and the SMC.\nSIMBA/SEST millimeter observations for the SMC and FIRAS\nobservations for the Galaxy have a similar linear resolution, enabling a uniform study on similar giant molecular clouds in these\ntwo environments.\nWe find a clear difference between the two samples: in the\nGalaxy, the virial mass is systematically larger than the mass\ndeduced from millimeter emission, while in the SMC sample,\nthe virial mass is lower than the mass deduced from millimeter emission. The main uncertainty in the mass determination\ncomes from the dust emissivity per hydrogen atom in the SMC.\nWe have used the millimeter emissivity determined in Galactic\nmolecular gas scaled by 1/6 to account for the lower SMC metallicity. This scaling factor has been calculated asssuming similar\ndepletions of heavy elements in the SMC and in the Galaxy. We\nconsider this assumption to be conservative because diffuse ISM\ndepletions have been inferred to be smaller in the SMC than in\nthe Galaxy from UV spectroscopy and dust observations. The\nmillimeter cloud masses would have been larger for smaller depletions (i.e. smaller dust-to-gas ratio), enhancing the discrepancy.\nFor Galactic clouds the dust and CO masses are consistent\nwith the gamma ray detemination of the Galactic XCO factor.\nThe virial masses are higher than the cloud masses. The underestimation of SMC molecular cloud masses by virial methods is\nthus an unexpected result. Inspecting the assumptions made in\nthe virial mass computations, we find that magnetic field support in the clouds could explain the difference between the two\nmass estimates. In this scenario, SMC giant molecular clouds are\nnot fully supported by turbulent motions. Additional support is\ngiven by a magnetic field of \u223c 15\u03bcG. Further studies and magnetic field observations are needed to confirm this interpretation.\nAn alternative explanation is that the virial mass is underestimated because the CO line width does not measure the full\namplitude of the turbulent motions within the cloud. In the SMC\nGMCs, the CO emission is expected to come from dense clumps\nembedded in lower density gas where CO is photo-dissociated.\nThe bulk of the cloud mass is in the lower density gas, but the CO\nline width only measures the velocity dispersion of the clumps.\nCan the lower density gas turbulence be higher than the clump to\nclump velocity dispersion? This study emphasizes the power of\nmillimeter emission as a dense matter tracer. The large amount\n\n\fC.

However, dust properties could vary from diffuse\nto dense regions (Cambr\u00e9sy et al. 2001; Stepnik et al. 2003;\nCambr\u00e9sy et al. 2005). We therefore chose to recompute the\nemissivity of dust is computed in the molecular ring in order\nto represent the properties of dust associated with molecular hydrogen.\nIn the molecular ring, the 1.2mm dust continuum and CO\nemissions longitude profiles along the Galactic plane are well\ncorrelated and the ratio of their intensities is constant: R =\n(0.89 \u00b1 0.01) * 10\u22121 MJy(K.km.s\u22121 .sr)\u22121 (Boulanger et al., in\nprep.). This ratio is related to the well known CO-to-H2 conversion factor (X = N(H2 )/ICO ) through the following equation:\nR = 2\u01ebH (\u03bb)B\u03bb(T dust )X,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere \u01ebH is the dust emissivity per hydrogen atom in the observed region. Although T dust may vary from one cloud to the\nother, these variations are likely to be moderate and can therefore\nbe neglected at millimeter wavelenght while T > 10K. In this\nstudy, we consider the temperature range measured by FIRAS as\npertinent for molecular clouds analysis. The CO-to-H2 factor is\nempirically determined in different environments and is largely\ndiscussed in the litterature.\nIn our Galaxy and in particular in the solar neighbourhood,\nstudies of \u03b3 rays and gas tracers (Strong et al. 1988) enable\na determination of this X factor. For our Galaxy as a whole,\nthe analysis of recent observations gives X factors between\n1.56 and 1.9 \u00d7 1020 mol.cm\u22122 .(K.km.s\u22121 )\u22121 (Strong & Mattox\n1996; Hunter et al. 1997; Grenier et al. 2005). We use the recent estimate obtained for the local molecular clouds through\n\u03b3 rays analysis (Grenier et al., priv. comm.): X = 1.8 \u00b1 0.3 *\n1020 mol.cm\u22122 (K.km.s\u22121 )\u22121 .\nUsing this local Galactic X factor and using the ratio of millimeter and CO intensities determined in the molecular ring, we\ncompute the emissivity of dust associated with molecular gas in\nour Galaxy:\nre f\n\n\u01ebH (1.2mm, H2) = (1.20 \u00b1 0.20) \u00d7 10\u221226 at\u22121 .cm2\n\n(A.2)\n\nThis value is used in eq. 2 to compute molecular cloud masses.\n\n\f10\n\nC. Bot et al.: mm dust emission unveilling the true mass of SMC GMCs\n\nThe dust emissivity in the diffuse medium is measured\nthrough the correlation at high Galactic latitude betwwen\ndust emission and H i emission at low column densities\n(Boulanger et al. 1996). For a dust temperature of 17.2K, this\ncorrelation gives a dust emissivity per hydrogen atom of:\nre f\n\n\u01ebH (1.2mm, HI) = (6.7 \u00b1 1.2) * 10\u221227 at\u22121 .cm2 .\n\nComparing this value to the dust-to-hydrogen mass ratio for \u03b6\nOph dust7 , the dust-to-gas mass ratio difference between the\nSMC and the Solar Neighbourhood is found to be:\nxS MC\n= 0.17\nx\u2299\n\n(B.2)\n\n(A.3)\n\nDust emissivity in the molecular medium is therefore twice\nlarger than in the diffuse medium. Such an increase in emissivity from the diffuse medium to molecular clouds was observed in our Galaxy, but on much smaller and denser regions\n(Cambr\u00e9sy et al. 2001; Stepnik et al. 2003). This increase is observed to be correlated with a drop small grain abundance. It has\nbeen thus interpreted as the coagulation of small grains between\nthemself or on large grains in dense regions of molecular clouds,\ngiving composite porous grains with a larger emissivity.\n\nAppendix B: The dust to gas ratio in the SMC\nThe gas-to-dust ratio in the SMC has been determined by using extinction curves to derive N(H i)/A(V) values (Gordon et al.\n2003; Bouchet et al. 1985; Tumlinson et al. 2002). However, the\nderived values correspond to specific line of sights (where extinction can be measured), they rely on the present extinction law\nunderstanding, and there is a significant scatter from one region\nto the other and from one study to the other 6 . Bot et al. (2004)\ndeduced a gas-to-dust ratio 30 times the solar value by comparing the dust and H i emission of the SMC. However, this value\nrefers to the diffuse medium and could reflect dust grain destruction processes that do not apply so intensively in the denser environnements of the SMC bar where grains are more shielded. A\ngenerally used value for the SMC dust-to-gas ratio is one tenth\nof the solar one, using the metallicity difference (Dufour 1984).\nHowever, it relates to gas phase abundances while we are interested in dust masses and most importantly since 1984 the solar\nabundances have been updated (Sofia & Meyer 2001b,a).\nWe therefore choose to recompute the SMC dust abundances\nto evaluate the dust-to-gas mass ratio difference between the\nSMC and the Solar Neighbourhood. For that, we assume that\nthe elemental depletions are the same in the SMC as in the Solar\nNeighbourhood. This is supported by studies of Sk 108 in the\nmain bar of the SMC, where the depletion patterns are similar to\nthose of Galactic halo clouds Welty et al. (1997); Mallouris et al.\n(2001). The depletions in the SMC could be less than the solar\nvalues (Rolleston et al. 2003), so that our estimation could be\nan upper limit. Comparing the \u03b6 Oph dust and solar abundances\ngiven by Sofia & Meyer (2001b,a), we inferred depletions \u03b7 of\n0.66, 0.11, 0.46, 0.92, and 0.95 for C, N, O, Mg, and Si respectively.\nThe main sequence star AV 304 shows no sign of processing in its photosphere and could therefore represent the presentday total (gas and dust) composition of the SMC (Rolleston et al.\n2003). Using Trundle et al. (2004) corrected abundances for this\nstar with the depletion factors computed above, the dust-tohydrogen mass ratio can be computed:\nmdust X\nmM\n=\n[M/H]tot * \u03b7 M *\n,\n(B.1)\nmH\nmH\nM\nand is used as an estimate of the dust-to-gas mass ratio. We obtained a dust-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 1.51 * 10\u22123 for the SMC.\n6\nThe dust to has ratio found this way to range between \u223c 1/6 and\n\u223c 1/30 the Galactic value\n\n7\nmdust /mH (\u03b6Oph) = 8.88 * 10\u22123 as computed from Sofia & Meyer\n(2001b,a) abundance values.\n\n\f"}
