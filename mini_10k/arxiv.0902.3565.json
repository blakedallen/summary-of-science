The review by Kerswell 1\ndiscusses the main results up to 2002 and emphasises the relevance of elliptical instability to a\nbroad range of applications. One of these is the instability of two-dimensional vortices that are\ndeformed elliptically by a large-scale strain flow. This is especially important for the dynamics\nof the atmosphere and ocean, since this is characterised by an abundance of vortices that are\ndeformed through either mutual interactions or the effect of large-scale flows. In this context,\nhowever, the planetary rotation and density stratification need to be taken into account.\nRotation and stratification clearly exert a strong influence on elliptical instability: since\nthis stems from the parametric resonance between the periodic fluctuations associated with\n1\n\n\fthe elliptical motion and the free waves supported by the flow, the dispersion relation of these\nwaves is critical. In the presence of rotation and stratification, the waves are inertia-gravity\nwaves whose frequency is bounded from below by the minimum of the Coriolis parameter f and\nBrunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency N . As a consequence, a vortex of fixed vorticity ceases to be unstable\nby the subharmonic instability responsible for the simplest form of elliptical instability when f\nand N exceeds a certain threshold. As these parameters increase further, instabilities are limited\nto resonances of higher and higher order, leading to decreasing growth rates. This was clearly\ndemonstrated by Miyazaki 2 on the basis of numerical solutions of the Floquet problem that\nmodels elliptic instability. Further numerical results were obtained by McWilliams and Yavneh 3\nwho concentrated on the regime of rapid rotation and strong stratification with N > f most\nrelevant to the atmosphere and ocean. Their broad motivation was the role that instabilities play\nin the generation of inertia-gravity-wave-like motion, and the resulting breakdown of the nearly\ngeostrophic and hydrostatic balance that is typical of much of the atmosphere and ocean. The\npresent paper shares the same motivation. It re-examines the elliptical instability of a rotating\nstratified fluid and derives explicit analytical results in the limit of fast rotation f \u226b \u03a9 and\nstrong stratification N \u226b \u03a9, where \u03a9 denotes the (relative) vorticity of the flow.\n\nSeveral recent papers 4;5;6;7 have demonstrated in specific examples that instabilities of well-\n\nbalanced basic flows to inertia-gravity-wave perturbations (or perturbations related to similar\nfast waves) have growth rates that are exponentially small in the Rossby number, here proportional to \u03a9/f \u226a 1.1 Theoretical arguments 8;9 indicate that this is a generic property, and\nthe elliptical instability examined in this paper is no exception. In this case, the exponential\nsmallness can be roughly understood by noting that, in the manner typical of parametric instabilities 10 , the growth rates of the elliptical instability can be expected to be proportional to \u03a9n ,\nwhere n is the order of the resonance. Since, as pointed out by Miyazaki 2 , the minimum n is of\nthe order f /\u03a9 (for N > f ), this leads to the conclusion that growth rates are beyond all orders\nin the Rossby number. To go further than this rough argument and provide an estimate for the\ngrowth rate requires the exponential-asymptotics analysis of the Floquet problem relevant to\nthe elliptical instability. We carry out this analysis and, rather than relying on general asymptotic results for Hill's equations 11 , directly relate the growth of solutions to the occurrence of a\nStokes phenomenon 12 which we capture using a combination of WKB expansion and matched\nasymptotics in complex time. The analytical results are confirmed by the numerical solutions\nof the Floquet problem.\n1\n\nNote that we use the convential form of Rossby number rather than its inverse as used in Ref. 2 .\n\n2\n\n\fOne of the issues which our treatment clarifies is the difference between the instability\nof cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices. Cyclones have been recognised as less unstable than\nanticyclones, to the extent that McWilliams and Yavneh 3 considered only the instability of the\nlatter. We show that the cyclones are in fact linearly unstable, with growth rates that have\nthe same exponential dependence on the Rossby number as the corresponding anticyclones but\ndiffer by a factor which, although formally of order one, turns out to be numerically very small.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we formulate the problem of elliptical\ninstability in a rotating stratified fluid modelled using the Boussinesq approximation. We use\nthe simplest instance of elliptical instability, that of an unbounded elliptical vortex with uniform\nvorticity. This makes it possible to seek global solutions in the form of plane waves with timeperiodic wavevector and an amplitude that satisfies a Hill's equation. (Results for this particular\ncase have a much broader appeal, however, since an identical Hill's equation arises when the\nstability of more general elliptical vortices is examined locally using the geometric-optics technique. 13;14 ) The Floquet problem associated with the Hill's equation is solved asymptotically\nin section 3 in the limit of fast rotation and strong stratification, with the eccentricity of the\nelliptical streamlines assumed of order one. For simplicity, we also make the hydrostatic approximation assuming that N \u226b f and an order-one Burger number. The asymptotic derivation\nis only sketched in section 3, with technical details relegated to Appendix A. The asymptotic\nresults are confirmed by direct numerical solution of the Floquet problem in section 4. The\neffect of a finite N/f is also briefly examined there.\n\n2\n\nFormulation\n\nWe consider the stability of a horizontal elliptical flow in a three-dimensional stratified fluid,\nwith constant Brunt\u2013V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency N , rotating about the vertical axis at rate f /2 > 0.\nThe flow's streamfunction, velocity and vorticity are written as\n\u03a8=\u2212\n\n\u0001\n1\nbx2 + ay 2 ,\n2\n\nU = (ay, \u2212bx, 0)\n\nand \u03a9 = a + b,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere ab > 0. We define\n\u03c2 = sgn a = sgn b\nand note that the flow is anticyclonic for \u03c2 = 1, and cyclonic for \u03c2 = \u22121. Three dimensionless\nparameters characterise the flow, namely\ne=\n\np\n\na/b,\n\n\u01eb=\n\n\u221a\nab/f\n3\n\nand f /N,\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fwhich are recognised as the aspect ratio of the elliptical flow, a Rossby number and the Prandtl\nratio. We assume that e > 1 without loss of generality.\nPerturbations to the flow (2.1) take the form of plane waves with time-dependent wavevector,\nwith each field written as\nu(x, t) = \u00fb(t)eik(t)*x,\nwhere the wavevector k = (k, l, m) satisfies\nk\u0307 = bl,\n\nl\u0307 = \u2212ak\n\nand\n\n\u1e41 = 0,\n\n(2.3)\n\nthe overdot denoting differentiation with respect to t. In what follows, we use a dimensionless\ntime variable obtained by taking (ab)\u22121/2 as a reference time. In terms of this variable, the\nsolutions to (2.3) have the simple form\nk = k0 cos t,\n\nl = \u2212\u03c2ek0 sin t and\n\nm = m0 ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere k0 and m0 are constant. The stability of (2.1) depends on the behaviour of the amplitudes\n\u00fb(t), v\u0302(t), etc. as t \u2192 \u221e. These satisfy a set of ordinary differential equations with time-periodic\ncoefficients. Following McWilliams and Yavneh 3 , this set can be conveniently reduced to a single\nsecond-order equation for the amplitude of the vertical component of the vorticity \u03b6\u0302 = i(lv\u0302 \u2212k\u00fb).\nAssuming that the perturbation potential vorticity vanishes, this equation reduces to\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0001\n2\u03c2\u01ebek02 m2 N 2 (k2 + l2 )\n1\n2\u03c2klm2 (e \u2212 e\u22121 )\n\u22121\n+\n1\u2212 2\n\u03b6 = 0, (2.5)\n\u03b6\u0307 + 2 1 \u2212 \u03c2\u01eb(e + e\n\u03b6\u0308 +\n\u03ba2 (k2 + l2 )\n\u01eb\nk + l2 \u03ba2\nf 2 \u03ba2\nwhere \u03ba2 = k2 + l2 + m2 and we have omitted the hat on the amplitude \u03b6. Four dimensionless\nparameters appear in this equation: the three flow parameters (2.2), and the initial aspect\nratio m0 /k0 of the perturbation. Note that anticyclonic flows (with \u03c2 = 1) are susceptible to\ncentrifugal instability (e.g. Ref. 15 ) when the relative vorticity exceeds f , that is, for \u01eb(e+ e\u22121 ) >\n1. Since we focus on the regime \u01eb \u226a 1 we do not this consider this instability further.\nMost of this paper focuses on a limiting case of (2.5) obtained by making the hydrostatic\napproximation. This assumes that m0 \u226b k0 and N \u226b f while\n\u03bc=\n\nf m0\n= O(1).\nN k0\n\n(2.6)\n\nThis is the regime most relevant to the dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans since the\ncondition N \u226b f is verified while, as we demonstrate below, the largest growth rates of the\nelliptical instability correspond to \u03bc = O(1). The parameter \u03bc can be recognised as the inverse\n\n4\n\n\fsquare root of a Burger number; it can be interpreted as the aspect ratio of the perturbation\nscaled by f /N as is natural in rapidly rotating, strongly stratified fluids.\nIn the hydrostatic approximation, \u03ba2 is approximated by m2 , and (2.5) reduces to\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0001\n1\nN 2 (k2 + l2 )\n2\u03c2\u01ebek02\n2\u03c2kl(e \u2212 e\u22121 )\n\u22121\n\u03b6\u0307 + 2 1 \u2212 \u03c2\u01eb(e + e\n+\n\u03b6 = 0.\n1\u2212 2\n\u03b6\u0308 +\nk 2 + l2\n\u01eb\nk + l2\nf 2 m2\n\n(2.7)\n\nUsing (2.4) and defining \u03c8 > 0 by\ne2 = 1 + \u03c8 2 ,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwe rewrite this equation as\n\u03b6\u0308 \u2212 p(t)\u03b6\u0307 +\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002 2\n\u03c9 (t) \u2212 \u01ebq(t) + \u01eb2 r(t) \u03b6 = 0.\n2\n\u01eb\n\n(2.9)\n\nHere\n\u03c92 = 1 +\n\nN 2 (k2 + l2 )\n= 1 + \u03bc\u22122 (1 + \u03c8 2 sin2 t),\nf 2 m2\n\n(2.10)\n\ncan be recognised as the square of the inertia-gravity-wave frequency (non-dimensionalised by\nf ). We have also introduced\n\u03c8 2 sin(2t)\n,\np(t) =\n1 + \u03c8 2 sin2 t\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22121\n\nq(t) = \u03c2 e + e\n\n2e\n+\n1 + \u03c8 2 sin2 t\n\n\u0013\n\nand\n\nr(t) =\n\n2(e2 + 1)\n. (2.11)\n1 + \u03c8 2 sin2 t\n\nEquation (2.9) is a Hill equation, with coefficients that are \u03c0-periodic in t. Its stability is\ndetermined using the Floquet theory for Hill equations 10 . Briefly, if \u03b6(t) = (\u03b61 (t), \u03b62 (t))T is a\ncolumn vector of independent solutions,\n\u03b6(t + \u03c0) = M \u03b6(t)\nfor some constant matrix M . The eigenvalues \u03bb of M are then the Floquet multipliers, and two\nfundamental solutions can be found for which\n\u03b6(t) = e\u03c3t \u03c6(t),\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere\n\u03c3=\n\n1\nlog \u03bb\n\u03c0\n\n(2.13)\n\nis the Floquet exponent, and \u03c6(t) is \u03c0-periodic. Note that the form of the coefficient of \u03b6\u0307\nensures that the two multipliers satisfy \u03bb1 \u03bb2 = 1. Instability occurs when one of these is such\nthat |\u03bb| > 1 or, equivalently, Re \u03c3 > 0. The matrix M is computed by relating \u03b6 and \u03b6\u0307 at two\ntimes t and t + \u03c0. Here we choose t = \u2212\u03c0/2 and compute M as\nM = [\u03b6(\u03c0/2), \u03b6\u0307(\u03c0/2)][\u03b6(\u2212\u03c0/2), \u03b6\u0307(\u2212\u03c0/2)]\u22121 .\n5\n\n(2.14)\n\n\fOur aim is to determine the largest values of the growth rate Re \u03c3 for (2.9) analytically\nin the fast-rotation regime \u01eb \u226a 1, with N \u226b f , \u03bc = O(1) and \u03c8 = O(1). In this regime\n(2.9) ressembles the Hill equations with large parameters whose stability has been studied by\nWeinstein and Keller 11 using a mapping to parabolic cylinder functions. However, there are\ndifficulties in applying their results directly, related to the presence of a first derivative term\nthat is singular for the complex values of t such that k2 + l2 = 0. We have therefore found it\nsimpler to develop a different approach, combining WKB analysis with complex-time matching.\nThis approach, which has the advantage of demonstrating the link between the instability and\nthe Stokes phenomenon 12;16 , is described in the next section and in Appendix A. The analytic\nresults obtained there are confirmed and extended to finite N/f in section 4 by solving (2.9)\nnumerically.\n\n3\n\nWKB analysis\n\nA WKB solution of the form\n\u03b6 = A(t)ei\u03b8(t)/\u01eb\n\n(3.1)\n\ncan be introduced into (2.9), and the (real) functions A(t) and \u03b8(t) can be derived by expansion\nin powers of \u01eb. At leading order, we find that\n\u03b80 (t) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u03c9(t\u2032 ) dt\u2032 .\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2\n\nAt the next order, we have\n\u02260\nA0\n\u03b8\u03071\n\n\u03c9\u0307\np\n+ ,\n2\u03c9 2\nq\n= \u2212 .\n2\u03c9\n= \u2212\n\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n\nWe note that A0 (t) is \u03c0-periodic; this is also true for higher-order corrections, so that there\nis no instability to any algebraic order in \u01eb: the fundamental solutions are given by \u03b6 in (3.1)\nand its complex conjugate, and the Floquet multipliers are simply \u03bb = \u00b1 exp(i\u03b8(\u03c0/2)) (taking\n\u03b8(\u2212\u03c0/2) = 0). Instability is necessarily an exponentially small effect; furthermore, it can only\noccur for values of the parameters such that \u03bb is exponentially close to \u00b11. This is because the\ncondition for instability |\u03bb| > 1 requires the two multipliers to be purely real; however, they\nare complex conjugate to all orders in \u01eb, a property which persists in the presence of a small\nperturbation in the non-degenerate cases \u03bb 6= \u00b11.\n\n6\n\n\fComputations detailed below show that the solution defined by (3.1) for \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 t < \u2212\u03b4,\nwith \u03b4 \u226a 1, switches on an exponentially small term as the Stokes line Re t = 0 is crossed.\nDenoting by S the corresponding Stokes multiplier, which is exponentially small in \u01eb, this\nimplies that the pair of solution\n\u03b6 = A(t)ei\u03b8(t)/\u01eb\n\nand \u03b6\u0304 = A(t)e\u2212i\u03b8(t)/\u01eb\n\n(3.5)\n\nvalid for \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 t < \u2212\u03b4 (for some \u01eb1/2 \u226a \u03b4 \u226a 1) becomes\ni\nh\n\u03b6 = A(t) ei\u03b8(t)/\u01eb + Se\u2212i\u03b8(t)/\u01eb\n\ni\nh\nand \u03b6\u0304 = A(t) e\u2212i\u03b8(t)/\u01eb + S\u0304ei\u03b8(t)/\u01eb\n\n(3.6)\n\nfor \u03b4 < t \u2264 \u03c0/2.

Some conclusions can be drawn\nfrom the figure and the examination of the explicit expressions (3.12)\u2013(3.13). First, \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e in\nthe limits of both small and large \u03bc; specifically \u03b1 = O(\u03bc\u22121 ) as \u03bc \u2192 0 and \u03b1 = O(log \u03bc) as\n\u03bc \u2192 \u221e. This suggests, as is confirmed by Figure 1, that the largest growth rates are attained\nfor \u03bc = O(1). Thus, the aspect ratio of the perturbations that grow as a result of the elliptical\ninstability of vortices should be expected to be the Prandlt ratio: m0 /k0 = O(N/f ). Second,\n8\n\n\fthe behaviour of \u03b1 for small and large eccentricity is given by\np\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2 1 + \u03bc2\n2\nas \u03c8 \u2192 0,\nlog \u03c8 + 1 \u2212 2 log 2 \u2212 log(1 + \u03bc )\n\u03b1 \u223c \u2212\n\u03bc\n2\n(1 + \u03bc2 )\u03c0\n\u03b1 \u223c\nas \u03c8 \u2192 \u221e.\n2\u03bc\u03c8\n\n(3.14)\n(3.15)\n\nThe large-\u03c8 expression (3.15) can actually be used to estimate \u03b1 for values of \u03c8 as small as 1,\nwhich makes it very useful. (For \u03bc = 1, for instance, the error in (3.15) is 15%, 10% and 5%\nfor \u03c8 = 1, 1.5 and 2, respectively.) This expression shows in particular that the largest growth\nrates are attained precisely for \u03bc \u223c 1 when \u03c8 is large. Third, the obvious fact that \u03b2 > 0 shows\nthat anticyclonic flows (\u03c2 = 1) are more unstable than cyclonic flows (\u03c2 = \u22121). According to\n(3.11), the growth rate in an anticyclonic flow is a factor exp(2\u03b2) larger than the growth rate\nof the corresponding cyclonic flow. Formally, this is an O(1) factor, but the typical values of \u03b2\nare such that it is numerically very small, so that the instability of cyclones is exceedingly weak\nand probably negligible in most circumstances. Note that because \u03b2 is a decreasing function of\ne, the asymmetry between cyclones and anticylones is the largest for small eccentricity.\nThe formulas (3.10)\u2013(3.13) give completely explicitly expressions for the maximum growth\nrates of the elliptical instability in terms of the three parameters \u01eb, \u03bc and e (recall that \u03c8 =\n\u221a\ne2 \u2212 1). These growth rates are achieved when the three parameters are related in such a way\nthat exp(i\u03b8/\u01eb) = \u00b11, that is,\n\u03b8 = n\u03c0\u01eb,\n\nn = 1, 2, * * * .\n\n(3.16)\n\nThis condition can be recognised as a resonance condition between the phase of the inertiagravity oscillations and the period of rotation around the elliptical vortex (2\u03c0 in the dimensionless time used here).\nThe growth rates can be written more directly in terms of \u01eb, \u03bc and e by solving (3.16)\npeturbatively, with \u03b8 = \u03b80 + \u01eb\u03b81 + * * *, and \u03b80 and \u03b81 obtained from (3.2) and (3.4). This gives\nthe approximate position of the instability bands as well as their width. To leading order, the\ninstability bands are centred at values of e and \u03bc satisfying\nZ\nZ 1r\nq\n1 + \u03bc 2 + \u03c8 2 x2\n2\n1 \u03c0/2\n1 + \u03bc2 + \u03c8 2 sin2 t dt =\ndx = n\u03c0\u01eb,\n\u03b80 =\n\u03bc \u2212\u03c0/2\n\u03bc 0\n1 \u2212 x2\n\nn = 1, 2, * * * . (3.17)\n\nThe computation of the correction \u01eb\u03b81 is more involved. Note that it is in principle needed\nto obtain a leading-order approximation to the growth rate Re \u03c3 as a function of e and \u03bc.\nThis is because the error on \u03b1 needs to be o(\u01eb), which requires to approximate the resonance\nvalues of e and \u03bc with an o(\u01eb) error also. We do not pursue these detailed computations here:\n9\n\n\fsince the values of e and \u03bc satisfying the resonance condition (3.16) are \u01eb-close together, (3.10)\nprovides a useful approximation to the growth rates of the instability without the need to\nlocate the resonances accurately. This is demonstrated in the next section where we compare\nthe prediction (3.10) with numerical solutions of the Floquet problem associated with (2.7).\nNote that the band width can be deduced directly from the expression (3.17) for \u03b80 . For\nfixed \u01eb and e, for instance, T in (3.8) can be written as T = \u01eb\u22121 \u2206\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03b8, where \u2206\u03bc is the distance\nbetween \u03bc and the resonant values, and the derivative is evaluated at resonance. According to\n(3.9), the instability-band width is therefore \u2206\u03bc = 2\u01eb|S|/\u2202\u03bc \u03b8 where \u03b8 can be approximated by\n\u03b80 .\n\n4\n\nComparison with numerical results\n\nWe have solved the Floquet problem associated with equation (2.9) for the amplitude \u03b6 numerically using Matlab's standard Runge\u2013Kutta solver. The growth rates Re \u03c3 obtained in this\nmanner are compared with the asymptotic estimate (3.10) for \u03c3max . To emphasise the exponential dependence on the inverse Rossby number 1/\u01eb, it is convenient to display Re \u03c3 as a function\nof 1/\u01eb for fixed values of \u03bc and of e. Figure 2 shows the results obtained in case of anticyclonic\nvortices (with \u03c2 = 1) for several values of e and \u03bc. Similar results for cyclonic vortices (\u03c2 = \u22121)\nare displayed in Figure 3.\nThe figures confirm the validity of our asymptotic estimate. They also suggest that this\nestimate remains useful for moderately small values of \u01eb, say \u01eb . 1/2. Note that the dimensional\n\u221a\ngrowth rates are obtained by multiplying \u03c3 by ab which is related to the relative vorticity\n\u221a\n\u03a9 = a + b of the flow by ab = \u03a9/(e + e\u22121 ). As expected from our asymptotics, the growth\nrates in the case of cyclonic flows are exceedingly small for \u01eb \u226a 1 even for the large eccentricities\nused in Figure 3. Nonetheless, our results clarify the fact that all elliptical flows are unstable,\nregardless of the sense of the rotation, of its strength, and of the strength of the stratification.\nNote that the match between asymptotic and numerical results for cyclonic flows appears to\ndegrade for small \u01eb (i.e., large 1/\u01eb); this is because the smallness of both the growth rate and\ninstability-band width makes the maximum growth rate delicate to estimate numerically.\nThe separation between instability bands can be estimated from the asymptotic formula\n(3.17): in terms of the varying 1/\u01eb used in the figures, it is given by\n\u03b3= Z\n2\n\n\u03c0\u03bc\n1\n0\n\nr\n\n1 + \u03bc 2 + \u03c8 2 x2\ndx\n1 \u2212 x2\n10\n\n.\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n0.2\n\n0.06\n0.15\n\nRe \u03c3\n\n0.04\n\nRe \u03c3\n\n0.1\n\n0.02\n0.05\n\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0\n0\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1/\u01eb\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1/\u01eb\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n0.12\n0.4\n0.1\n\n0.08\n\n0.3\n\nRe \u03c3 0.06\n\nRe \u03c3\n0.2\n\n0.04\n0.1\n0.02\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n0\n0\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1/\u01eb\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n1/\u01eb\n\nFigure 2: Growth rates Re \u03c3 in anticyclonic flows as functions of the inverse Rossby number\n1/\u01eb for (a) e = 1.5, \u03bc = 1; (b) e = 2, \u03bc = 1; (c) e = 2, \u03bc = 0.5; and (d) e = 4, \u03bc = 1.

This assumption, which could be relaxed, is made because it corresponds to the regime most relevant to\natmospheric and oceanic flows; it is consistent in the sense that the growth rates obtained are\nmaximized for \u03bc = O(1) and decay rapidly for \u03bc \u226b 1 or \u03bc \u226a 1.

The\nresults obtained for \u03bc = 1 and e = 4 are displayed in Figure 4. This compares the growth rate\nobtained in the hydrostatic approximation with those obtained for N/f = m0 /k0 = 3 and 6.\nExcept for \u01eb & 1, there is relatively little difference between the results: the maximum growth\nrates fall on the same curve, well described by the hydrostatic asymptotics. Of course, the\nlocation of the instability bands changes depending on S, but this is not significant, since they\nwould also change if m0 /k0 was varied independently of N/f , as is physically relevant.\nAcknowledgments.

The Stokes phenomenon occurs as t \u2208 R crosses one of the Stokes lines joining tn to t\u0304n .\nIn the interval [\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2] of interest, the only Stokes line is the segment of Re t = 0 joining t0 to\nt\u03040 . We compute S using matched asymptotics, examining how the solution \u03b6 = A(t) exp(i\u03b8(t)/\u01eb)\nconnects to the solution \u03b6 = A(t)[exp(i\u03b8(t)/\u01eb) + S exp(\u2212i\u03b8(t)/\u01eb)] as this segment is crossed. 17\nTo analyse the behaviour of the solution in the neighbourhood of t0 , we first note that\n\u03c9 \u223c a1/2 ei\u03c0/4 (t \u2212 t0 )1/2 ,\n\nwhere a =\n\np\n\n2(1 + \u03bc2 )(1 + \u03c8 2 + \u03bc2 )/\u03bc2 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nas t \u2192 t0 .

We claim\nthat the solution of interest is\nh\ni\nZ \u223c C Ai(e\u2212i\u03c0/6 \u03c4 ) + iBi(e\u2212i\u03c0/6 \u03c4 ) .\n\n(A.3)\n\nWe verify that this solution matches A(t) exp(i\u03b8(t)/\u01eb) to the left of the Stokes line Re t = 0; in\ndoing so we find an expression for the constant C. It is convenient to verify the matching along\n13\n\n\fthe line ph \u03c4 = \u22125\u03c0/6; this is an anti-Stokes line along which the two independent solutions of\n\n(A.2) have similar orders of magnitudes. Along this line, we can use the asymptotic formulas 18\n1\ncos(2z 3/2 /3 \u2212 \u03c0/4),\n\u03c0z 1/4\n1\nBi(\u2212z) \u223c \u2212 \u221a 1/4 sin(2z 3/2 /3 \u2212 \u03c0/4),\n\u03c0z\n\nAi(\u2212z) \u223c\n\n(A.4)\n\n\u221a\n\n(A.5)\n\nwith z = \u2212 exp(\u2212i\u03c0/6)\u03c4 = exp(5i\u03c0/6)\u03c4 \u2192 +\u221e.

Here \u0393\u2212 denotes a contour joining \u2212\u03c0/2 to t0 while remaining to the left\nof the Stokes line Re t = 0. Comparing (A.7) with (A.6) shows that \u03b6 correctly matches Z\nprovided that\nC=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03c0e\u2212i\u03c0/6\ne\n(\u01eba)1/6\n\nR\n\np(t\u2032 ) dt\u2032 /2 i\u01eb\u22121\n\ne\n\n\u0393\u2212\n\nR\n\n\u0393\u2212\n\n[\u03c9(t\u2032 )\u2212\u01ebq(t\u2032 )/(2\u03c9(t\u2032 ))] dt\u2032\n\n.\n\n(A.8)\n\nWe now match Z with the outer solution valid to the right of the Stokes line Re t = 0. A\nconnection formula for Airy functions 18 gives the alternative form\nZ \u223c 2Cei\u03c0/3 Ai(e\u2212i5\u03c0/6 \u03c4 ),\n\n(A.9)\n\nfor (A.3). Carrying out the matching on the anti-Stokes line ph \u03c4 = exp(\u2212i\u03c0/6), we can use\nthe asymptotic formula for Ai in (A.4) to write that\n\u0011\nCei\u03c0/24 \u0010 i\u03c0/4 3/2\ni\u03c0/4 3/2\nZ \u223c \u221a 1/4 e2ie \u03c4 /3 + ie\u22122ie \u03c4 /3\n\u03c0\u03c4\n\n(A.10)\n\nfor |\u03c4 | \u2192 \u221e.
