Introduction\nAlthough chiral soliton model predictions for the mass of the lightest exotic pentaquark, the \u0398+ with zero isospin and unit strangeness, have been\naround for some time1 , the study of pentaquarks as baryon resonances became popular only recently when experiments2,3 indicated their existence.\nThese experiments were stimulated by a chiral soliton model estimate4 suggesting that such exotic baryons might have a widtha so small4,5 that it\ncould have escaped earlier detection. These novel observations initiated\nexhaustive studies on the properties of pentaquarks. Comprehensive lists\nof such studies are, for example, collected in refs.9,10,11 .\nIn chiral soliton models states with baryon quantum numbers are generated from the soliton by canonically quantizing the collective coordinates\nassociated with (would\u2013be) zero modes such as SU (3) flavor rotations. The\n+\nlowest states are members of the flavor octet (J \u03c0 = 12 ) and decuplet rep+\nresentations (J \u03c0 = 32 ). Due to flavor symmetry breaking the physical\nstates acquire admixtures from higher dimensional representations. For\n+\nthe J \u03c0 = 12 baryons those admixtures originate dominantly from the antidecuplet, 10, and the 27\u2013plet12 . They also contain states with quantum\n\u2217 Talk\n\npresented at the Pentaquark workshop at Spring\u20138, July 2004.\nfor pentaquark decays are obtained from axial current matrix elements4,6,7,5 .\nFrom what is known about the \u2206 \u2192 \u03c0N transition8 , such estimates may be questioned.\na Estimates\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nnumbers that cannot be built as three\u2013quark composites but contain additional quark\u2013antiquark pairs. Hence the notion of exotic pentaquarks. So\nfar, the \u0398+ and \u039e3/2 with masses of 1537\u00b110MeV 2 and 1862\u00b12MeV 3 have\nbeen observed, although the single observation of \u039e3/2 is not undisputed13 .\n+\nSoliton models predict the quantum numbers I(J \u03c0 ) = 0( 12 ) for \u0398+ and\n3 1+\n2 ( 2 ) for \u039e3/2 . These quantum numbers are yet to be confirmed experimentally.\nRadial excitations14 of the octet nucleon and \u03a3 are expected to have\nmasses similar N and \u03a3 type baryons in the 10. Hence sizable mixing\nshould occur between an octet of radial excitations and the antidecuplet.\nRoughly, this corresponds to the picture that pentaquarks are members of\nthe direct sum 8\u229510 which is also obtained in a quark\u2013diquark approach15.\nSome time ago a dynamical model was developed16 to investigate such mix+\ning effects and also to describe static properties of the low\u2013lying J \u03c0 = 21\n+\nand J \u03c0 = 32 baryons. Essentially that model has only a single free parameter, the Skyrme constant e which should be in the range e \u2248 5.0 . . . 5.5.\nLater the mass of the recently discovered \u0398+ pentaquark was predicted with\nreasonable accuracy in the same model6 . In this talk I will present predictions for masses of the \u039e3/2 and additional exotic baryons that originate the\n27\u2013plet from exactly that model without any further modifications. The\nlatter may be considered as partners of \u0398+ and \u039e3/2 in the same way as\nthe \u2206 is the partner of the nucleon. It is also interesting to see whether\nestablished nucleon resonances, such as the N (1710), qualify as flavor partners of the \u0398+ pentaquark. To this end, I will consider transition magnetic\nmatrix elements between the nucleon and its excitations predicted by the\nmodel. A more complete description of the material presented in this talk\nmay be found in ref.17 .\n2. Collective Quantization of the Soliton\nI consider a chiral Lagrangian in flavor SU (3). The basic variable is the\nchiral field U = exp(i\u03bba \u03c6a /2) that represents the pseudoscalar fields \u03c6a\n(a = 0, . . . , 8). Other fields may be included as well. For example, the\nspecific model used later also contains a scalar meson. In general a chiral\nLagrangian can be decomposed as a sum, L = LS + LSB , of flavor symmetric and flavor symmetry breaking pieces. Denoting the (classical) soliton\nsolution of this Lagrangian by U0 (~r) states with baryon quantum numbers\nare constructed by quantizing the flavor rotations\nU (~r, t) = A(t)U0 (~r)A\u2020 (t),\n\nA(t) \u2208 SU (3)\n\n(1)\n\n\f3\n\ncanonically. According to the above separation the Hamiltonian for the collective coordinates A(t) can be written as H = HS + HSB . For unit baryon\nnumber the eigenstates of HS are the members of SU (3) representations\nwith the condition that the representation contains a state with identical\nspin and isospin quantum numbers. Radial excitations that potentially mix\nwith states in higher dimensional SU (3) representations are described by\nan additional collective coordinate \u03be(t) 14,16\nU (~r, t) = A(t)U0 (\u03be(t)~r)A\u2020 (t) .\n\n(2)\n\nChanging to x(t) = [\u03be(t)]\u22123/2 the flavor symmetric piece of the collective\nHamiltonian for a given SU (3) representation of dimension \u03bc reads\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u03b13 \u03b2 4 \u2202\n\u22121\n1\n1\n1\nHS = p\nJ(J + 1) + C2 (\u03bc) + s ,\n+V +\n\u2212\n3\n4\n\u2202x\nm\n\u2202x\n2\u03b1\n2\u03b2\n2\u03b2\n2 m\u03b1 \u03b2\n(3)\nwhere J and C2 (\u03bc) are the spin and (quadratic) Casimir eigenvalues associated with the representation \u03bc. Note that m = m(x), \u03b1 = \u03b1(x), . . . , s =\ns(x) are functions of the scaling variable to be computed in the specified\nsoliton model16 . For a prescribed \u03bc there are discrete eigenvalues (E\u03bc,n\u03bc )\nand eigenstates (|\u03bc, n\u03bc i) of HS . The radial quantum number n\u03bc counts the\nnumber of nodes in the respective wave\u2013functions. The eigenstates |\u03bc, n\u03bc i\nserve to compute matrix elements of the full Hamiltonian\n\u0001\nH\u03bc,n\u03bc ;\u03bc\u2032 ,n\u2032\u03bc\u2032 = E\u03bc,n\u03bc \u03b4\u03bc,\u03bc\u2032 \u03b4n\u03bc ,n\u2032\u03bc\u2032 \u2212 h\u03bc, n\u03bc | 12 tr \u03bb8 A\u03bb8 A\u2020 s(x)|\u03bc\u2032 , n\u2032\u03bc\u2032 i .

Here B refers to the specific baryon and m labels\nits excitations. I would like to stress that quantizing the radial degree\nof freedom is also demanded by observing that the proper description of\nbaryon magnetic moments requires a substantial feedback of flavor symmetry breaking on the soliton size18 .\n\n3. Results\nI divide the model results for the spectrum into three categories. First there\nare the low\u2013lying J = 12 and J = 23 baryons together with their monopole\nexcitations. Without flavor symmetry breaking these would be pure octet\nand decuplet states. Second are the J = 21 states that are dominantly\nmembers of the antidecuplet. Those that are non\u2013exotic mix with octet\nbaryons and their monopole excitations. Third are the J = 32 baryons that\nwould dwell in the 27\u2013plet if flavor symmetry held. The J = 21 baryons\n\n\f4\nTable 1.\nMass differences of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (4) with respect to the nucleon in MeV.

Ordinary Baryons and their Monopole Excitations\nTable 1 shows the predictions for the mass differences with respect to the\nnucleon of the eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian (4) for two values of the\nSkyrme parameter e. The agreement with the experimental data is quite\nastonishing. Only the Roper resonance (|N, 1i) is predicted a bit on the\nlow side when compared to the empirical Breit\u2013Wigner mass but agrees\nwith the estimated pole position. This is common for the breathing mode\napproach in soliton models14 . All other first excited states are quite well\n+\nreproduced. For the 21 baryons the energy eigenvalues for the second\nexcitations overestimate the corresponding empirical data somewhat. In\nthe nucleon channel the model predicts the m = 3 state only about 40MeV\nhigher than the m = 2 state, i.e. still within the regime where the model\nis assumed to be applicable. This is interesting because empirically it is\nsuggestive that there might exist more than only one resonance in that\n+\nenergy region20. For the 32 baryons with m = 2 the agreement with data\nis on the 3% level. The particle data group19 lists two \"three star\" isospin\u2013\n1\n2 \u039e resonances at 751 and 1011MeV above the nucleon whose spin\u2013parity is\n+\nnot yet determined. The present model suggests that the latter is J \u03c0 = 12 ,\nwhile the former seems to belong to a different channel.\nThe present model gives fair agreement with available data and thus\n\n\f5\nTable 2.

Most\nnotably, the inclusion of higher dimensional SUF (3) flavor representations\nin three flavor chiral models does not lead to the prediction of any novel\nstates in the regime between 1 and 2GeV in the non\u2013exotic channels.\n3.2. Exotic Baryons from the Antidecuplet\nTable 2 compares the model prediction for the exotics \u0398+ and \u039e3/2 to\navailable data2,3 and to a chiral soliton model calculation21 that does not\ninclude a dynamical treatment of the monopole excitation. In that calculation parameters have been tuned to reproduce the mass of the lightest\nexotic pentaquark, \u0398+ . The inclusion of the monopole excitation increases\nthe mass of the \u039e3/2 slightly and brings it closer to the empirical value.\nFurthermore, the first prediction4 for the mass of the \u039e3/2 was based on\nidentifying N (1710) with the nucleon like state in the antidecuplet and thus\nresulted in a far too large mass of 2070MeV. Other chiral soliton model\nstudies either take M\u039e3/2 as input22 , adopt the assumptions of ref. 4 or are\nless predictive because the model parameters vary considerably10.\nWithout any fine\u2013tuning the model prediction is only about 30\u201350MeV\nhigher than the data. In view of the approximative nature of the model\nthis should be viewed as good agreement. Especially the mass difference\nbetween the two potentially observed exotics is reproduced within 10MeV.\n3.3. Baryons from the 27\u2013plet\nThe 27\u2013plet contains states with the quantum numbers of the baryons that\nare also contained in the decuplet of the low\u2013lying J = 32 baryons: \u2206, \u03a3\u2217\nand \u039e\u2217 . Under flavor symmetry breaking these states mix with the radial\nexcitations of decuplet baryons and are already discussed in table 1. Table 3\nshows the model predictions for the J = 23 baryons that emerge from the\n\n\f6\nTable 3. Predicted masses of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (4) for the exotic J = 32\nbaryons with m = 0 and m = 1 that originate from the 27\u2013plet with hypercharge (Y)\nand isospin (I) quantum numbers listed. I also compare the m = 0 case to treatments of\nrefs.21,22,23 . All numbers are in GeV.\n\n\u039827\nN27\n\u039b27\n\u039327\n\u03a027\n\u03a927\n\nB\nY\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\nI\n1\n1/2\n0\n2\n3/2\n1\n\ne=5.0\n1.66\n1.82\n1.95\n1.70\n1.90\n2.08\n\ne=5.5\n1.69\n1.84\n1.98\n1.73\n1.92\n2.10\n\nm=0\nWK21\n1.67\n1.76\n1.86\n1.70\n1.84\n1.99\n\nBFK22\n1.60\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\n1.70\n1.88\n2.06\n\nWM23\n1.60\n1.73\n1.86\n1.68\n1.87\n2.07\n\nm=1\ne=5.0\ne=5.5\n2.10\n2.14\n2.28\n2.33\n2.50\n2.56\n2.12\n2.17\n2.35\n2.40\n2.54\n2.59\n\n27\u2013plet but do not have partners in the decuplet. Again, the experimental\nnucleon mass is used to set the mass scale. Let me remark that the particle\ndata group19 lists two states with the quantum numbers of N27 and \u039b27\nat 1.72 and 1.89GeV, respectively, that fit reasonably well into the model\ncalculation. In all channels the m = 1 states turn out to be about 500MeV\nheavier than the exotic ground states.\n3.4. Magnetic Moment Transition Matrix Elements\nTable 4 shows the model prediction for magnetic moment transition matrix\nelements for states with nucleon quantum numbers. I expect the model to\nreliably predict these matrix element because it also gives a good account\nof the magnetic moments of the spin\u2013 21 baryons, in particular with regard\nto deviations from flavor symmetric relations16. It is especially interesting\nto compare them with the result originating from the assumption that the\nN (1710) be a pure antidecuplet state24 . This assumption yields a proton\nchannel transition matrix element much smaller than in the neutron channel. While I do confirm this result for the case of omitted configuration\nmixing (entry |10, 0i \u2192 |8, 0i) it no longer holds true when the effects of\nTable 4.

Then the transition matrix elements in the proton and neutron channels for the N (1710) candidate state\n(m = 2) are of similar magnitude. This difference to the pure 10 picture for the N (1710) should be large enough that data on electromagnetic\nproperties could test the proposed mixing scheme.\n\n4. Conclusion\nIn this talk I have discussed the interplay between rotational and monopole\nexcitations for the spectrum of pentaquarks in a chiral soliton model. In this\napproach the scaling degree of freedom has been elevated to a dynamical\nquantity which has been quantized canonically at the same footing as the\n(flavor) rotational modes. Then not only the ground states in individual\nirreducible SUF (3) representations are eigenstates of the (flavor\u2013symmetric\npart of the) Hamiltonian but also all their radial excitations. I have treated\nflavor symmetry breaking exactly rather then only at first order. Thus,\neven though the chiral soliton approach initiates from a flavor\u2013symmetric\nformulation, it is capable of accounting for large deviations thereof.\n+\n+\nThe spectrum of the low\u2013lying 21 and 23 baryons is reasonably well\nreproduced. Also, the model results for various static properties are in\nacceptable agreement with the empirical data16 . This makes the model reliable to study the spectrum of the excited states. Indeed the model states\ncan clearly be identified with observed baryon excitations; except maybe\nan additional P11 nucleon state although there exist analyses with such a\nresonance. Otherwise, this model calculation did not indicate the existence\nof yet unobserved baryon states with quantum numbers of three\u2013quark\ncomposites. Here the mass difference between mainly octet and mainly\nantidecuplet baryons is a prediction while it is an input quantity in most\nother approaches4,21,22,23,10 and the computed masses for the exotic \u0398+\nand \u039e3/2 baryons nicely agree with the recent observation for these pentaquarks. The present predictions for the masses of the spin\u2013 32 pentaquarks\nshould be sensible as well and are roughly expect between 1.6 and 2.1GeV.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to the organizers for providing this pleasant and worthwhile\nworkshop.
