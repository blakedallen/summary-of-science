INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Yang-Mills theories naturally arise as low energy\nlimits of the theory of open strings. One can obtain YangMills theories with different gauge groups by studying different D-brane configurations (see e.g. [1]). For instance,\nif we place N D-branes on top of each other in the flat\nspace, the corresponding open string theory gives rise to\nthe Yang-Mills theory with the gauge group U (N ). One\ncan also obtain gauge theories with other gauge groups\nsuch as SO(N ) and Sp(N ) by using the orientifold construction. In more detail, one combines the spatial reflection \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c3 on the string world-sheet with the\ntarget space reflection, X \u03bc \u2192 \u2212X \u03bc , \u03bc = 1, . . . , k and\nX \u03bc \u2192 X \u03bc , \u03bc = (k + 1), . . . , 10. It is the goal of this\nnote to study which gauge groups can be realized in the\npresence of the background B-field when the brane worldvolume turns into a noncommutative space [2,3,4].\nInteraction with the B-field introduces an extra term\ninto the Polyakov action of the string [4],\nZ\n\u2212i\n\u2206S =\nB\u03bc\u03bd \u01ebab \u2202a X \u03bc \u2202b X \u03bd .\n(1)\n2 \u03a3\n\nII. THE CLOSURE OF CLASSICAL LIE\nALGEBRAS UNDER THE MOYAL\nCOMMUTATOR\n\nIn the flat case the presence of a constant B-field turns\nthe D-branes into noncommutative spaces, with the ordinary pointwise multiplication of functions replaced by\nthe Moyal product,\ni\n(X \u2217 Y )(x) = exp( \u03b8ij \u2202ix \u2202jy )X(x)Y (y)|x=y =\n2\ni\n= XY + \u03b8ij \u2202i X\u2202j Y + ...\n2\n\nHere X and Y are functions on the D-brane worldvolume, and \u03b8ij is a real-valued constant antisymmetric\ntensor constructed of the metric and B-field [3]. The\nMoyal product naturally extends to N by N matrices,\nformula (3) still applies. One can also introduce the\nMoyal commutator by the formula,\n\nHere a, b = 1, 2 are world-sheet indices, \u03a3 is the worldsheet and B\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212B\u03bd\u03bc is the B-field on the target space.\nOne requires the expression (1) to be invariant with respect to the orientifold reflection. This implies the following transformation rules for components of the B-field,\nBkk \u2192 \u2212Bkk\nBk\u22a5 \u2192 Bk\u22a5\n\n[X, Y ]\u2217 = X \u2217 Y \u2212 Y \u2217 X.\n\n(4)\n\nIn what follows we check whether the matrix Lie algebras of the classical Lie groups SO(N ), U (N ), SU (N )\nand Sp(N ) are closed under the Moyal commutator. We\nchoose to work in the fundamental representation of these\nLie algebras.\nThe Lie algebra of U (N ) consists of anti-Hermitean\nmatrices, X t = \u2212X, where the bar stands for complex\nconjugation. We first show that this algebra is closed under the Moyal commutator. The key observation is the\nfollowing property of the Moyal product,\n\nB\u22a5\u22a5 \u2192 \u2212B\u22a5\u22a5\nB\u22a5k \u2192 B\u22a5k .\n\n(3)\n\n(2)\n\nHere the symbols k and \u22a5 stand for the target space indices \u03bc = 1, . . . , k and \u03bc = (k+1), . . . , 10, respectively. In\nthe orientifold construction we finally let the branes lie on\nthe orientifold. The continuity of the B-field implies that\nthe B-field on the brane, Bkk , vanishes. Hence, the brane\nworld-volumes are commutative since it is Bkk which is\nresponsible for the noncommutativity [2,3,4]. This consideration indicates that one should encounter difficulties in the construction of the gauge theories with gauge\ngroups SO(N ) and Sp(N ) on noncommutative spaces.\nSomewhat surprisingly, we find that the reduction from\n\n(X \u2217 Y )t = Y t \u2217 X t .\n\n(5)\n\nBy using the ordinary rules for the transpose of matrices\nwe get,\n(X \u2217 Y )t = Y t X t +\n1\ni\n+ \u03b8ij \u2202j Y t \u2202i X t \u2212 \u03b8ij \u03b8kl \u2202j \u2202l Y t \u2202i \u2202k X t + ...\n2\n8\n1\n\n(6)\n\n\fThe construction for higher order terms is obvious. Now\nwe apply the complex conjugation and rename the indices\nof \u03b8 to obtain,\ni\n(X \u2217 Y )t = Y t X t + \u03b8ij \u2202i Y t \u2202j X t \u2212\n2\n1 ij kl\nt\n\u03b8 \u03b8 \u2202i \u2202k Y \u2202j \u2202l X t + ... = Y t \u2217 X t .\n8\n\nand the Moyal product coincides with the ordinary multiplication of matrix-valued functions. With X and Y as\ngiven above one can easily compute the Moyal commutator since all derivatives of order higher than one vanish.\nThe result for both counter examples is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u22121 0\n\u03b1\u03b2\n.\n(14)\n[X, Y ]\u2217 = i\u03b8\n0 \u22121\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nTaking into account X t = \u2212X and Y t = \u2212Y yields,\n[X, Y\n\n]t\u2217\n\n= (X \u2217 Y\nt\n\n=Y \u2217\n\n)t\n\nXt\n\n\u2212Y \u2217\n\nX)t\n\nXt\n\nt\n\n\u2212\n\n=\n\n\u2217Y =\n\n= Y \u2217 X \u2212 X \u2217 Y = \u2212[X, Y ]\u2217\n\nNote that this matrix has a nonvanishing trace. Since\nthe Lie algebras of SO(2), SU (2) and Sp(2) consist of\ntraceless matrices, we conclude that they are not closed\nunder the Moyal commutator. This also applies to\nSO(N ), SU (N ) and Sp(N ) for arbitrary N because they\ncontain SO(2), SU (2) and Sp(2) as subgroups.\nAcknowledgements First of all I would like to thank\nAnton Alekseev who has been very helpful during the\npreparation of this note.
