Coincidence of PWN with EGRET Sources\nA pulsar wind nebula (PWN) is a X-ray, radio, and/or H\u03b1 nebula\ncaused by a relativistic particle wind from an energetic pulsar (see\nKaspi et al. (2004) and Gaensler (2004) for recent reviews). Of the \u223c 50\nknown PWN, a large fraction are coincident with EGRET sources. If\nwe consider only the \u223c 30 sources with significant emission above 1 GeV\n(listed in the catalog of Lamb and Macomb (1997)) which are probably\nassociated with our Galaxy, nearly half the error ellipses contain a\nknown PWN, and several of the others have not yet been searched\ncarefully for X-ray nebulae. In Table I, we list all the known PWN\ncoincident with EGRET sources (for references to these sources, see\nhttp://www.physics.mcgill.ca/\u223cpulsar/pwncat.html). We also list the\nmorphological type (S or R, see below) if it can be determined, the\npulsar spin-down energy \u0116 if pulsations have been detected, and the\nvariability index V12 of the EGRET source as defined and determined\nby Nolan et al. (2003). 10\u2212V12 is the integrated liklihood that the\nvariability measure \u03c4 \u2261 \u03c3F / < F > \u2264 0.12, or the > 100 MeV flux\nis consistent with being constant. In other words, V12 > 1 indicates\na > 90% confidence level that the \u03b3-ray source is variable. No value\nindicates there is no evidence for variability.\nc 2018 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Pulsar Geometry From Stationary Pulsar Wind Nebulae\nThe environment of a young pulsar is the expanding ejecta of its progenitor star. This allows for fast expansion of the young PWN relative\nto the kick velocity imparted to the pulsar. Therefore, the motion of\nthe pulsar does not greatly affect the structure of the PWN. The underlying symmettries of the pulsar's spinning magnetic field are then\nreflected in the structure of the X-ray emitting PWN. We refer to\nthese as stationary PWN (SPWN). SPWN tend to have some sort\nof equatorial toroidal structure and polar jets. The apparent ellipticity\nand brightness variations of these toroidal structures can be used to\ninfer the orientation of the pulsar's spin axis relative to the observer.\nIn addition, the magnetic inclination angle may relate to the thickness\nof the torus in the case of single or concentric torii such as the Crab,\nor the separation between two parallel torii such as is apparently the\ncase for the Vela PWN. For details in the methodology used to model\nobserved SPWN torii, see Ng and Romani (2004).\n\nmroberts.tex; 12/11/2018; 3:27; p.2\n\n\fPWN in EGRET Error Boxes\n\n3\n\nThis geometrical information is crucial for interpreting \u03b3-ray pulse\nprofiles and hence understanding the particle acceleration mechanisms\nin pulsar magnetospheres. It is therefore important to infer the geometry of many torii around \u03b3-ray emitting pulsars. Unfortunately, in only\na handful of cases is the PWN structure clear enough for unambiguous\ninterpretation of the geometry, even with the high resolution of the\nChandra X-ray observatory. Only three of the known \u03b3-ray pulsars\n(Crab, Vela, and PSR B1706\u221244) have torii amenable to fitting. It is\ntherefore important to expand the number of potential \u03b3-ray emitting\npulsars with torii. X-ray imaging of unidentified EGRET source error\nboxes has resulted in the detection of two energetic young pulsars with\nwell structured nebulae: PSR J2229+6114 (Halpern et al., 2001) and\nPSR J2021+3651 (Hessels et al., 2004).\n\nFigure 1. X-ray image of the region of the COS B source 2CG 075+00 containing\ntwo 3rd EGRET Catalog sources (light green contours), one GeV Catalog source\n(ellipse) and the refit GeV contours. The Arecibo beam pointing is shown which was\nused to discover PSR J2021+3651.\n\nThe methodology used to discover PSR J2021+3651 is illustrative\nof how to discover and measure usable torii. The \u03b3-ray source is in the\ncrowded Cygnus region, which contains two highly significant GeV catalog sources which are not listed in the 3rd EGRET Catalog. A refitting\nof the region using only photons above 1 GeV but including all known\nEGRET sources was performed in order to obtain the best position (see\nFig. 1). A low resolution, wide field, hard X-ray observation was made\n\nmroberts.tex; 12/11/2018; 3:27; p.3\n\n\f4\n\nRoberts et al.\n\nusing the ASCA GIS detectors, discovering an apparent point source\nat the \u223c 1\u2032 resolution of ASCA (Roberts et al., 2001). This allowed\nthe 3\u2032 beam of the Arecibo telescope to perform a very deep search\nof the source to discover the \u223c 0.1 mJy pulsar with spin properties\nvirtually identical to PSR B1706\u221244 (Roberts et al., 2002). A 20 ks\nChandra ACIS image of the X-ray source revealed a compact nebula\nwith a morphology highly suggestive of a double torus with polar jets.\nHowever, the scarcity of counts in the image leaves some ambiguity as\nto whether or not it is a single or double torus, and whether the jets\nare real (Fig. 2).\n\nFigure 2. Chandra image of PSR J2021+3651 with best fit double and single torus\nmodels (Hessels et al. 2004).\n\nIf the double torus interpretation is made, then the separation of the\ntwo torii can be assumed to be an indication of the magnetic inclination\nangle. This can be sanity checked by looking at the intrinsic radio pulse\nwidth, which may indicate whether the pulse is predominantly a core\nor conal component, and by measuring the radio polarization sweep\nand fitting it to a Radhakrishnan and Cooke (1969) model.\nUnfortunately, the above 5 sources are the only known pulsars associated with EGRET sources whose nebulae are large enough and bright\nenough to be useful for fitting. However, there are several more PWN\nwith toroidal morphologies which either do not yet have detected pulsations or are not yet associated with a \u03b3-ray source. Even with GLAST ,\nit is likely that only \u223c 10 \u03b3-ray pulsars will be found whose geometry\ncan be well constrained by their nebulae with Chandra imaging. We\ncan only hope that will be enough to determine the location in the\nmagnetosphere where \u03b3-rays are emitted.\n3. Rapidly Moving Pulsar Wind Nebulae Associated With\nVariable EGRET Sources\nThe SPWN discussed above tend to be associated with hard spectrum\n(\u0393 <\n\u223c 2), steady (V12 < 1) EGRET sources. Such sources tend to be\nnearly 100% pulsed in 100 \u2212 10000 MeV \u03b3-rays, and be the youngest\n\nmroberts.tex; 12/11/2018; 3:27; p.4\n\n\fPWN in EGRET Error Boxes\n\n5\n\nand most energetic pulsars. After a few thousand years, the reverse\nshock of the supernova blast wave reaches the PWN, after which the\nenvironment is no longer the expanding ejecta causing the PWN expansion to slow dramatically and become subsonic. If the pulsar has\na significant space velocity, it will start to catch up to the forward\nedge of the PWN, drastically affecting the morphology as ram-pressure\nbecomes more important. If the space velocity exceeds the local sound\nspeed, then the PWN will be confined in the forward direction by a bowshock. These cometary shaped nebulae we refer to as rapidly-moving or\nram-pressure confined PWN (RPWN). In X-rays, they generally have a\nnarrow outflow trailing the pulsar, with the pulsar itself typically having a spin-down energy such that log\u0116 \u223c 35.5 \u2212 36.5 erg/s, somewhat\nless than the typical SPWN. This is expected given their on average\ngreater age.\nPerhaps the best example of a RPWN is the Mouse nebula near\nthe Galactic center. The X-ray nebula of the Mouse is significantly\nbrighter than other RPWN, and consequently shows significantly more\nstructure (Fig. 3). A \"tongue\" of brighter emission is surrounded by\na fainter halo, which is contained within the bright radio \"head\" of\nthe Mouse. A fainter radio body extends back from the head, which\neventually narrows into an extremely long tail (Gaensler et al., 2003).\nHydrodynamic models suggest the tongue is associated with the wind\ntermination shock. However, much of the structure, especially downstream of the head, is currently not understood. The generally short\nChandra observations of other RPWN contain very few counts, and\nonly the structure corresponding to the Mouse's \"tongue\" is clearly\ndelineated.\nRemarkably, several RPWN have been discovered in the error boxes\nof EGRET sources which are apparently variable. The source with\nthe highest V12 value in the Galactic plane without a potential Blazar\nidentification is GeV J1809\u22122327. An X-ray nebulae was discovered in\nits error box with ASCA (Roberts et al., 2001) which subsequent Chandra and VLA imaging showed to be a RPWN (Braje et al., 2002). An\nXMM-Newton EPIC-PN observation, which was unfortunately taken\nin small window mode, suggests a fainter X-ray halo surrounding the\nX-ray trail seen in the short Chandra exposure, strongly reminiscent of\nthe Mouse (Fig. 4). The X-ray emission seen in the EPIC-PN image is\ncoincident with the front edge of the radio PWN, itself reminiscent of\nthe head of the Mouse, with the suggestion of a fainter, extended body\nto the Northwest. The radio and X-ray emission seems to extend back\ntowards a possible X-ray SNR, G7.4\u22121.4, discovered by ROSAT . Widefield 90cm imaging is underway to determine if there is a corresponding\nradio SNR. The PWN appears to be embedded in the Lynds 227 dark\n\nmroberts.tex; 12/11/2018; 3:27; p.5\n\n\f6\n\nRoberts et al.\n\nFigure 3. Chandra X-ray and VLA radio images of the Mouse nebula showing the\nvarious structures (Gaensler et al. 2003).\n\nNebula, and CO imaging suggests a physical connection between the\nPWN and the molecular cloud (Oka et al., 1999).\nThe region near Galactic longitude l = 18\u25e6 contains several EGRET\nsources, one or more of which are probably associated with the well\nknown unidentified 1\u221230 MeV Comptel source (see Collmar et al., these\nproceedings). Wide-field radio imaging (Brogan et al. in preparation)\nof the region shows several SNR and the Sharpless 53 cluster of HII\nregions. One of the EGRET sources, GeV J1825\u22121310, has the second\nhighest V12 value of Galactic plane sources. ASCA imaging of this\nsource followed by a short Chandra image again revealed a faint RPWN\nin a stellar cluster (Romani et al. in preparation). There is some hint\nof a larger radio nebula in the 90cm image.\nTwo other sources with V12 > 1.3 (95% confidence of variability) contain apparent RPWN. One is the PWN around PSR B1853+01 in the\nX-ray composite SNR W44 (Petre et al., 2002). The other is the source\ncontaining the Kookaburra radio complex, the wings of which contain\nthe PWN around PSR J1420\u22126048 and the Rabbit PWN (Roberts\n\nmroberts.tex; 12/11/2018; 3:27; p.6\n\n\fPWN in EGRET Error Boxes\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Left: VLA and Chandra images of the PWN in GeV J1809\u22122327. The\ncontours on the Chandra image are from the EPIC-PN, which are cut off due to\nthe small window used. Right: ROSAT image of the SNR G7.4\u22121.4, with contours\nfrom the VLA image of the PWN.\n\net al., 1999). Chandra and XMM-Newton imaging of the Rabbit nebula\n(Ng et al., Roberts et al. in preparation) show the X-ray emission going\nfrom a point source in the front paw back towards the body and the\nsouthern wing of the Kookaburra. This strongly suggests the Rabbit is\nthe head of a RPWN, with the wing being the fainter body. In addition\nto these sources, there is a probable RPWN, G369.89\u22120.08 (Lu et al.,\n2003), within the error box of the variable source near the Galactic\ncenter, which the Mouse is very near as well.\nOverall, around half of the Galactic plane sources with good evidence\nof variability and no candidate Blazar counterpart seem to contain\nRPWN. All of them also seem to be in regions containing molecular\nclouds or other evidence of relatively high densities in the ambient\nmedium. This suggests the \u03b3-ray emission may be associated with the\npulsar passing through local density enhancements.\n4. Conclusions\nThere is an intimate relationship between the generation of PWN and\nof \u03b3-ray emission. This is not surprising since both indicate particles\nbeing accelerated to very high energies in the pulsar magnetosphere.\nBecause of this, \u03b3-ray sources in the Galaxy tend to pick out PWN that\notherwise might be hard to find in the crowded Galactic plane. SPWN\nwith clear toroidal morphologies are key to determining pulsar geome-\n\nmroberts.tex; 12/11/2018; 3:27; p.7\n\n\f8\n\nRoberts et al.\n\ntries, but require deep Chandra imaging. No other X-ray telescope now\noperating or currently planned has the necessary resolution. RPWN\nappear to be associated with variable EGRET sources, which AGILE\nand GLAST should easily confirm. However, there is no real theory\ndeveloped yet as to how they might be generating \u03b3-ray emission, and\nmuch deeper Chandra X-ray imaging is required to determine their true\nstructure.\nReferences\nBraje, T.
