X-rays: general; X-rays: diffuse emission; X-rays: galaxies; Infrared: galaxies\n\n1. Introduction\nThe hard X-rays (2-10 keV) present the advantage that\nthey can penetrate large amounts of interstellar gas and\nthus can detect AGN which would be missed in optical\nwavelengths (Brandt & Hasinger 2005). The Chandra mission has probed at unparallelled depth the X-ray Universe.\nThe deep 2Ms observations in the Chandra Deep Field\n(CDF) North and South (Alexander et al. 2003, Giacconi\net al. 2002, Luo et al. 2008) resolved 80-90% of the\nextragalactic X-ray light, the X-ray background, in the\n2-10 keV band revealing a sky density of about 5000\nsources per square degree down to a flux of 1 \u00d7 10\u221216\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Bauer et al. 2004). These deep CDF obserSend offprint requests to: I.

These are\nthe so-called Compton-thick AGN (see Comastri 2004\nfor a review) where the probability for Thomson scattering becomes significant. The X-ray background synthesis\nmodels (Comastri et al. 1995, Gilli et al. 2007) can ex-\n\n\f2\n\nI. Georgantopoulos et al.: X-ray DOGs in the CDFs\n\nplain the peak of the X-ray background between 20-30\nkeV, where most of its energy density lies, (eg Frontera\net al. 2007, Churazov et al. 2007, Moretti et al. 2009)\nonly by invoking a numerous population of Comptonthick sources. Nevertheless, the exact surface density of\nCompton-thick AGN required is still debatable (see e.g.\nSazonov et al. 2008, Treister et al. 2009). Additional evidence for the presence of an appreciable Compton-thick\npopulation comes from the directly measured space density of black holes in the local Universe. It is found that\nthis space density is a factor of 1.5-2 higher than that\npredicted from the X-ray luminosity function (Marconi\net al. 2004, Merloni & Heinz 2008), although the exact\nfigure depends on the assumed efficiency in the conversion of gravitational energy to radiation. This immediately\nsuggests that the X-ray luminosity function is missing a\nlarge number of AGN. According to the X-ray background\nmodels a small number of Compton-thick AGN should\nbe lurking among the faint sources in the Chandra Deep\nFields. As Compton-thick sources have a quite distinctive X-ray spectrum in the 2-10 keV band, i.e. either a\nspectral turnover in the transmission dominated case or\na flat continuum in the reflection-dominated case, X-ray\nspectroscopy provides a reasonably robust way for identifying such heavily obscured sources. Tozzi et al. (2006)\nand Georgantopoulos et al. (2007, 2009) have looked for\nthese directly in the Chandra Deep Fields using X-ray\nspectroscopy.\nThe advent of the IR Spitzer mission brought an\nadditional perspective on the study of Compton-thick\nsources. This is because the absorbed optical and UV\nradiation heats the dust and is re-emitted at IR wavelengths. This implies that Compton-thick sources should\nemit copious amounts of mid-IR radiation. In particular, methods which combine the use of mid-IR and optical photometry have been quite fruitful. For example,\nthe method proposed by Daddi et al. (2007) involves the\nselection of UV sources with mid-IR excess. MartinezSansigre et al. (2005) argue that a population of bright\n24\u03bcm AGN with no 3.6\u03bcm detections is as numerous as\nunobscured QSOs at high redshift z > 2. Along these lines,\nHouck et al. (2005) have detected a population of 24\u03bcm\nbright sources which are very faint in the R-band having f24\u03bcm /fR > 1000. Dey et al. (2008) and Pope et al.\n(2008) argue that such sources are associated with Dust\nObscured Galaxies (DOG) at high redshift (z \u2248 2 with\na small scatter \u03c3z = 0.5). At these distances the implied\ntotal IR luminosities are LIR > 1012\u221214 L comparable or\nin excess of low redshift Ultra-Luminous-Infrared galaxies, ULIRG (Mirabel & Sanders 1996). Theoretical simulations prove that DOGs represent extreme gas-rich mergers in massive halos with \u223c 1013 M (Narayanan et al.\n2009). Hereafter, we will adopt the notation (DOGs) for\nmid-IR bright optically faint sources. Fiore et al. (2008)\nargue that most DOGs may be associated with heavily\nobscured sources below the flux limit of the 1Ms CDF-S\nsurvey. The stacked X-ray signal of the undetected DOGs\nin X-ray surveys, appears to be flat indicative of absorbed\n\nsources, see Fiore et al. (2008), Georgantopoulos et al.\n(2008), Fiore et al. (2009), Treister et al. (2009b), Eckart\net al. (2010), Donley et al. (2010). In particular, Fiore et\nal. (2009) argue that the content of Compton-thick sources\namong DOGs brighter than 550mJy at 24\u03bcm may be as\nhigh as 90%. Fiore et al. (2009) point out that at the\nbright mid-IR luminosities have been selected to ensure\nthat any undetected X-ray source should have a very low\nLX /L24\u03bcm ratio being either a Compton-thick AGN or a\ngalaxy. Georgantopoulos et al. (2008) note that although\nit is possible that a significant number of Compton-thick\nsources lie among the X-ray undetected DOGs, in the\nChandra deep fields it is also likely that Low-Luminosity\nAGN with moderate absorption may mimic a flat spectrum. Finally, Pope et al. (2008) on the basis of Spitzer\nIRS spectroscopy, caution that the normal galaxy (nonAGN) content of DOG samples may still be significant.\nIn any case, it is impossible to argue unambiguously that\nthese sources are Compton-thick given that only a stacked\nhardness ratio is available and not individual good quality\nX-ray spectra.\nHere instead, we attempt to address this issue by focusing on the DOGs which are present among the detected\nsources in deep X-ray surveys. We examine their X-ray\nspectra as well as their mid-IR properties and we compare with the properties of non X-ray detected DOGs. The\nprimary aim is to examine whether there is evidence for\nCompton-thick or at least heavily obscured sources among\nthe X-ray DOGs. We adopt Ho = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M =\n0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 throughout the paper.\n\n2. Data\n2.1. X-ray Data\n2.1.1. CDF-N\nThe CDF-N is centred at \u03b1 = 12h 36m 49s .4, \u03b4 =\n+62\u25e6 120 5800 (J2000) The 2Ms Chandra survey of the\nCDF-N consists of 20 individual ACIS-I (Advanced CCD\nImaging Spectrometer) pointings observed between 1999\nand 2002. The combined observations cover a total area\nof 447.8 arcmin2 and provide the deepest X-ray sample\ncurrently available together with the Chandra Deep Field\nSouth (Luo et al. 2008). Here, we use the X-ray source\ncatalogue of (Alexander et al. 2003), which consists of\n503 sources detected in at least one of the seven Xray spectral bands defined by these authors in the range\n0.3 \u2212 10 keV. The flux limit in the 2 \u2212 10 keV band is\n1.4\u00d710\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The Galactic column density towards the CDF-N is 1.6 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Dickey & Lockman\n1990).\n\n2.1.2. CDF-S\nThe 2Ms CDF-S observations consist of 23 pointings. The\nfirst 1Ms (11 observations) was observed between 1999\nand 2000. The analysis of the 1Ms data is presented in\n\n\fI. Georgantopoulos et al.: X-ray DOGs in the CDFs\n\nGiacconi et al. (2002) and Alexander et al. (2003). The\nanalysis of all 23 observations is presented in Luo et\nal. (2008). The average aim point is \u03b1 = 03h 32m 28s .8,\n\u03b4 = \u221227\u25e6 480 2300 (J2000). The 23 observations cover an\narea of 435.6 arcmin2 while 462 X-ray sources have been\ndetected by Luo et al. (2008). The CDF-S survey reaches\na sensitivity limit of 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the hard\n2-8 keV band. The Galactic column density towards the\nCDF-S is 0.9 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Dickey & Lockman 1990).\n\n2.2. Spitzer\nThe central regions of both the CDF-N and the CDF-S\nhave been observed in the mid-IR by the Spitzer mission (Werner 2000) as part of the Great Observatory\nOrigin Deep Survey (GOODS). These observations cover\nareas of about 10 \u00d7 16.5 arcmin2 in both fields using\nthe IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 \u03bcm) and the MIPS\n(24 \u03bcm) instruments onboard Spitzer. Typical sensitivities for both surveys are 0.3 \u03bcJy and 80 \u03bcJy for the\n3.6 \u03bcm IRAC and 24 \u03bcm MIPS respectively. The data\nproducts are available from the Spitzer data centre\n(http://data.spitzer.caltech.edu/popular/goods/).\n\n3. Optical Data\nBoth GOODS-North and GOODS-South have been imaged with ground-based telescopes as well as the HST.\nThe HST observations are part of the GOODS Legacy survey and are described in detail in Giavalisco et al. (2004).\nThe area imaged covers 2 \u00d7 180 arcmin2 with four ACS filters (F435W, F606W, F775W, and F850LP). The typical\nsensitivity is 27.8 mag(AB) in the F850LP filter. From the\nground, an area larger than the GOODS-North has been\nimaged with the KPNO-4 m-MOSAIC and the SubaruSuprime camera Capak et al. (2004) in the U, B, V, R,\nI, and z' bands. The catalogue contains sources detected\nin the R band with a limiting magnitude of 26.5(AB).\nThe GOODS-South has been imaged with the CTIO4 m-MOSAIC II camera as part of the MUSYC project\nGawiser et al. (2006). The survey is complete to a total\nmagnitude of R=25(AB).\n\n4. Sample Definition\nWe use the \"likelihood ratio\" method of Sutherland &\nSaunders (1992) to cross-correlate the positions of the\nsources in different catalogues. For the northern field we\nfollow the procedure described in detail in Rovilos et al.\n(2010). In short, we first find infrared (IRAC-3.6\u03bcm) counterparts to the X-ray sources and then we search the optical catalogue of Capak et al. (2004) for optical identifications. Spitzer-MIPS counterparts are again pinned\nto 3.6 \u03bcm positions. In order to select DOG candidates\nwe search for sources with log(f24\u03bcm /fR ) > 3 defining\nR=26.5(AB) as the lower limit for optical 'non-detections'\nand find 19 candidates. We then inspect by eye the optical\nimages of the 'non-detections' (15/19) to check if there are\n\n3\n\nany X-ray - IRAC sources with an obvious bright optical\ncounterpart which is not listed in the Capak et al. (2004)\ncatalogue. We find 6 such cases. We also remove source\nCDFN-109 from the list, because its MIPS counterpart is\nblended with a nearby source (CDFN-107) and the 24 \u03bcm\nflux is not reliable. The final northern sample of DOGs is\nlisted in Table 1.\nIn CDF-S, Grazian et al. (2006) provide the GOODSMUSIC catalog. This contains near-UV (U-band) magnitudes from the WFI at La Silla Arnouts et al. (2001)\nand VLT-VIMOS, optical magnitudes from the HSTACS Giavalisco et al. (2004), near-infrared magnitudes\n(J \u2212 H \u2212 KS ) from VLT-ISAAC, as well as mid-infrared\nmagnitudes from Spitzer-IRAC. The multi-band photometry has not been made by cross-correlating the various\ncatalogues, but with implementing the \"ConvPhot\" algorithm de Santis et al. (2007) to perform PSF-matching of\nthe various images, and detecting the sources in the image\nwith the best quality, in this case the ACS-F850LP.\nWe have used the Grazian et al. (2006) catalogue and\ncross-correlated it with the X-ray catalogue of Luo et al.\n(2008, 2010) using the maximum likelihood method, and\nalso with the MUSYC catalogue to have a more complete\ncoverage of the optical bands. The MUSYC catalogue contains sources detected in the combined B \u2212 V \u2212 R band\nand the KS band. We searched for Spitzer-MIPS counterparts to the optical sources and have selected the DOG\ncandidates using the MUSYC R-band to compare with\nthe 24 \u03bcm flux. We found 22 candidate sources assuming\na lower limit of 27.0 mag(AB) for MUSYC non-detections.\nWe again optically inspected the MUSYC images of the\nnon-detections (11/21) for obvious bright optical counterparts not in the MUSYC catalogue and found eight such\ncases. The final southern sample of DOGs is listed in Table\n1.\n\n5. X-ray Spectroscopy\nThe X-ray spectroscopy provides the most efficient tool for\ndetermining whether an AGN is absorbed. In the case of\nmoderate to heavy absorption (< 1024 cm\u22122 ) the energy\nof the absorption cut-off gives an accurate measurement\nof the absorbing column density. On the other hand, the\nmost heavily obscured sources, the Compton-thick AGN,\ncan be identified mainly through the presence of a very flat\nspectrum with a photon-index of \u0393 \u223c 1. This flat spectrum\nis the signature of a reflected continuum from obscuring\nmaterial around the central source. Thanks to the large\nexposure times, the CDF observations yield a sufficient\nnumber of counts allowing for X-ray spectroscopy to be\nperformed in most cases.\nWe use the SPECEXTRACT script in the CIAO v4.2\nsoftware package to extract spectra from the 20 individual\nCDF-N observations. The extraction radius varies between\n2 and 4 arcsec with increasing off-axis angle. At low offaxis angles (<4 arcmin) this encircles 90% of the light at\nan energy of 1.5 keV. The same script extracts response\nand auxiliary files. The addition of the spectral, response\n\n\f4\n\nI. Georgantopoulos et al.: X-ray DOGs in the CDFs\n\nTable 1.

We use the XSPEC v12.5 software package for the spectral fits (Arnaud 1996).\n\n5.1. Individual spectra\nWe fit the data using a power-law absorbed by a cold absorber. In the case where we have sufficient flux (fx >\n1 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), we treat both the intrinsic column density and the photon index (\u03931 ) as free parameters. In the rest of the cases where we have limited photon\nstatistics, we fix the power-law photon index to \u03931 = 1.8\n(Nandra & Pounds 1994, Tozzi et al. 2006) leaving only\nthe column density as the free parameter. The results are\nshown in Table 2. As it is customary in X-ray Astronomy,\nerrors correspond to the 90% confidence level.\nFirst, we investigate the brightest sources i.e. those\n12 with flux fx > 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . There are four\nsources which prefer a very flat power-law index (\u03931 < 1\nat the 90% confidence level) instead of intrinsic absorption: 92, 190, 423 in CDF-N, and 346 in CDF-S. This flat\nspectrum is consistent with a reflection dominated X-ray\n\nemission (e.g. Matt et al. 2004, Akylas & Georgantopoulos\n2009) and therefore these sources can be considered as\nCompton-thick candidates. We present an example X-ray\nspectrum (CDFN-190) in Fig. 1. We note that the properties of CDFN-92 and CDFN-190 have been discussed in\nmore detail in Georgantopoulos et al. (2009) as candidate\nCompton-thick sources. We discuss their findings particularly in respect with the presence of an FeK\u03b1 line. A high\nequivalent width (EW) FeK\u03b1 is often interpreted as the\n'smoking gun' giving away the presence of a Comptonthick AGN. CDFN-92 has an 90% upper limit of \u2248 0.7\nkeV (rest-frame). CDFN-190 which is associated with a\nsub-mm at a spectroscopic redshift of z=2.005 (Chapman\net al. 2005), has a detected FeK\u03b1 line with a rest-frame\nEW of \u223c 0.7 keV. CDFN-423 had not been included in\nthe sample of Georgantopoulos et al. (2009) as the source\nappeared to be very hard but with a large error on the photon index. The higher error had probably to do with the\nuse of different fitting statistics (\u03c72 ) in that paper in combination with the limited photon statistics (f2\u221210 \u2248 10\u221215\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ). No FeK\u03b1 line is detected in the spectrum\nof CDFN-423 with the 90% upper limit on the rest-frame\nEW being 0.65 keV. Finally, no FeK\u03b1 line is detected in\nthe spectrum of CDFS-346 at rest-frame energy of 6.4 keV\n(360 eV upper limit). The four flat sources constitute an\n\n\fI.

Power-law fit to the spectrum of the source CDFN190. The background is also plotted as crosses\n\nappreciable fraction (30%) of the sources with good quality X-ray spectra. We show the rest-frame column density\ndistribution of these bright sources in Fig. 2 (excluding\nCDFS-95 for which there is no redshift). We count all the\nfour flat spectrum sources as Compton-thick sources and\ntherefore we assign a value of NH = 1024 cm\u22122 for these\nat the observer's frame. For simplicity, we consider all the\ncolumn density upper limits as unabsorbed sources, assigning NH < 1022 cm\u22122 . Moreover, we show the column\ndensity distribution for our full sample in Fig. 2 (lowerpanel): 18 spectra have been considered excluding the four\nfaintest sources where a spectral fit is not feasible as well\nas the four sources with no redshift available.\nIn addition, we fit all the spectra with the simplest\npossible model i.e. a power-law model without absorption.\nThe photon index \u03932 results are given again in Table 2.\nThis exercise is quite useful in demonstrating the effects\nof spectral degeneracy. For example, CDFS-117 with a\nsteep spectral index of \u03931 = 1.81 and an observer's-frame\ncolumn density of only 0.43\u00d71022 cm\u22122 in the absorbed\npower-law model, has a flat equivalent photon-index of\n\u03932 \u223c 1.1, (in the power-law model), which could have been\ninterpreted as a characteristic of a reflection dominated\nspectrum. In Fig. 3 we plot the photon index \u03932 as a function of the total X-ray flux. We see that the DOGs span a\nlarge range in both flux and photon index. Seven sources\nare relatively unabsorbed having \u03932 > 1.4. A photon index\nof \u0393 = 1.4 corresponds to the stacked (co-added) spectrum\nof all sources in the CDF-S (Tozzi et al. 2001). The above\nfigure has to be interpreted with caution because of the\neffects of spectral degeneracy mentioned above. From this\nplot, we can securely tell which sources are relatively steep\nand thus unabsorbed i.e. those with \u03932 > 1.4. Thus we are\nconfident that 7 out of 22 sources present little absorption.\nHowever, we cannot use this plot to find Compton-thick\nsources. This is because the flat \u03932 sources could be hard\nbecause of an intrinsically flat spectral index suggestive\n\nFig. 2. Upper panel: rest-frame column density distribution of the brightest (11) sources with available redshift.\nLower panel: rest-frame column density for all (18) sources\nwith available redshift. Four sources with very low photon\nstatistics have been also excluded.\n\nof a reflection spectrum but alternatively because of just\nmoderate absorption. Only by examining sources which\nhave adequate photon statistics and by leaving both the\nphoton index and the column density as free parameters\nwe can have some indication on whether a source is truly\nintrinsically flat. Inspection of the photon index \u03932 column\nin Table 2 shows that there are 12 sources which appear\nflatter than \u0393 < 1. In this calculation we excluded sources\nCDFS-232 and CDFS-307 in which a fit with a moderate\nabsorbing column is preferable.\n\n5.2. Average X-ray spectrum\nWe derive the average X-ray spectrum of our sources separately for the CDF-N and CDF-S. The spectra are fit\njointly with the photon index tied to a common value.\n\n\f6\n\nI.

In four cases (CDFN-302,\nCDFN-317, CDFS-170 and CDFS-230), the very limited photon statistics did not allow even a single free parameter fit and\ntherefore \u03932 has been fixed to 1.8.

In the case where there is no redshift available we assign the median redshift z=2.3. \u2020 denotes candidate\nCompton-thick sources.\n\nWe use the C-statistic in the spectral fits. The average\nspectra are fit in the 0.3-4 keV band. This band has been\nselected by Fiore et al. (2008) and Georgantopoulos et al.\n(2008) for the derivation of the stacked signal of non-Xray detected DOGs in the CDF-S and CDF-N respectively.\nTheir choice was driven mainly by the fact that at high\nenergies the effective area rapidly decreases while the particle background becomes high. The best-fit results are\nshown in Table 3. The total number of counts in the spectra is given as well (source + background). As the total\nspectrum may be dominated by the most bright source,\nwe choose to present as well the best-fit results excluding\nthe source which contains the most photon counts. In the\nCDF-N the co-added photon index is very hard (\u0393 \u2248 1.07)\nwhile when we exclude the brightest source we obtain an\neven harder spectrum with \u0393 \u223c 0.6. In the CDF-S the\nspectrum is comparable, having \u0393 \u2248 1.13 and \u0393 \u223c 0.6\nwhen the brightest source is excluded. All photon indices\nabove are significantly harder than \u0393 \u2248 1.4 which cor-\n\nresponds to the co-added spectrum of all sources in the\nCDF-S (Tozzi et al. 2001) as well as to the spectrum of\nthe X-ray background in the 2-10 keV band (De Luca &\nMolendi 2004).\nWe also derive the average spectrum separately for\nsources with power-law (AGN) SEDs and star-forming\ntype SEDs (see next section for details). The results are\ngiven in Table 4. We see that there is no significant difference in the average X-ray spectrum of the two types\nof populations, at least when the brightest source is excluded.\n\n6. Mid-IR properties\n6.1.

For one source (CDFN-190) there\nare available sub-mm data (Chapman et al. 2005). We also\noverplot the best matching SED template from Polletta et\nal. (2007). Polletta et al. (2006, 2007) have made extensive studies of the SEDs of X-ray selected AGN. Polletta\net al. (2007) provide an inventory of template SEDs for\nvarious types of AGN and star-forming galaxies. In many\n\ncases the template of Mrk231 provides a satisfactory representation of the data suggesting an AGN underlying\ncontinuum. Mrk231 is the nearest Broad-Absorption-Line\nQSO (Braito et al. 2004) and an Ultra-Luminous-Infrared\ngalaxy (ULIRG). The SED of the remaining sources is\nwell represented by the Arp220 template. These are the\nsources with a distinct dip in their mid-IR spectra at a\nrest-frame wavelength below 10\u03bcm Arp220 (e.g. Iwasawa\n\n\f8\n\nI.

The black (filled) and red (open) circles\ndenote star-forming and AGN SEDs respectively. The solid lines denote the region occupied by unabsorbed AGN while\nthe region beyond the short dash line is populated by Compton-thick AGN in the local Universe (adapted from Bauer\net al. 2010). The long dash line denotes the Lx /L6\u03bcm \u2248 10\u22123 luminosity ratio of the undetected DOGs in the CDF-N\n(from Georgakakis et al. 2010). The crosses denote the flat-spectrum sources (see text). Finally for comparison we plot\nthe positions of Mrk231 and Arp220 on the diagram.\n\net al. 2005) is a ULIRG whose far-IR SED is dominated\nby a very strong star-forming component. The IR luminosities are presented in table 5. We emphasize that regardless of the mid-IR classification, most of our 26 DOGs\ncan be classified almost certainly as AGN on the basis of\ntheir high X-ray luminosity and LX /L6\u03bcm diagram (see\nbelow). Their 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity (see Table 2) exceeds the 1042 erg s\u22121 limit which is considered to be the\ndividing line between star-forming galaxies and AGN (e.g.\nZezas, Georgantopoulos & Ward 1998, Ranalli, Comastri\n& Setti 2003). Therefore the term 'star-forming' mid-IR\nSED should not be misleading.\n\n6.2. X-ray to 6\u03bcm mid-IR luminosity ratio\nOne of the most reliable proxies of the intrinsic power of an\nAGN is the mid-IR luminosity (e.g. Lutz et al. 2004). The\nmid-IR emission is believed to provide a good measurement of the AGN luminosity even in the most obscured\ncases, since it is more extended than the X-ray absorbing\n\nmaterial and thus represents an isotropic AGN property.\nConsequently we use the observed X-ray to mid-IR luminosity to provide further clues on whether our sources\nare obscured, expecting that the ratio of the X-ray to the\nmid-IR luminosity should be suppressed in the most obscured sources (eg Alexander et al. 2005, Alexander et al.\n2008). Here, we use the monochromatic 6\u03bcm mid-IR luminosity instead of the full IR luminosity. This is because\nthe former is more representative of the hot dust emission (> 300K) and thus provides a better diagnostic of\nthe AGN power. The 6\u03bcm luminosity is derived from our\nSED fitting.\nWe present the monochromatic 6\u03bcm IR luminosity\nagainst the 2-10 keV absorbed luminosity in Fig. 4. The\narea between the solid lines denotes the region of of the\nX-ray to 6\u03bcm plane where local AGN reside (Lutz et\nal. 2004). The area below the dashed line corresponds to\nlow X-ray luminosity sources i.e. Compton-thick sources\n(or alternatively normal galaxies). The crosses denote\nthe sources with flat spectral index \u0393. We see a rela-\n\n\fI. Georgantopoulos et al.: X-ray DOGs in the CDFs\n\n9\n\nFig. 5. Mid-IR colour-colour plot. Black and red crosses correspond to start-forming and AGN SEDs respectively.\nThe wedge defines the AGN region following the selection criteria of Stern et al. (2005). The colour tracks define two\ndifferent template SEDs as function of redshift up to z = 3. The blue line represents the Mrk231 (ULIRG, Comptonthick) template, while the green line represents Arp220 (ULIRG, star-forming) SED. For each template the position\nof the redshift z = 0 is marked with a large cross. The templates are taken from Polletta et al. (2007).\n\ntively good correspondence between the flat-\u0393 sources and\nthe low Lx /L6\u03bcm sources. One of the lowest Lx /L6\u03bcm\nsources is CDFN-190, a sub-mm galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of z=2.005 (Chapman et al. 2005). Other\nlow Lx /L6\u03bcm sources include CDFN-317 and CDFS-309.\nThe first is among the two faintest sources in the CDF-N\n(fx \u223c 1\u00d710\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) where the very poor photon\nstatistics did not even allow a single-parameter spectral fit\n(Lx \u2248 4 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 ). The photon statistics of CDFS309 allow a single parameter fit only. Its photon index is\nflat with \u03932 = 0.72+0.78\n\u22120.72 . Alternatively, assuming \u0393 = 1.8\nits rest-frame column density would be 4 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 .\n\n6.3. IRAC Colour-Colour diagram\n\nFig. 3. The Photon index \u03932 of X-ray detected DOGs as\na function of the total band flux (filled circles) for column density fixed to NH = 0. For comparison we plot the\nphoton indices of all sources in the CDF-N (small dots).\n\nIt is interesting to examine the position of our sources on\nthe IRAC colour-colour diagram. Mid-IR colour selection\nhas been suggested as a powerful tool for selecting AGN\n(see e.g Martinez-Sansigre et al. 2005). The principle behind this approach is that luminous AGN have power-law\nspectral energy distribution in the mid- IR, while galaxies\nhave characteristic black-body spectra that peak at about\n1.6 \u03bcm. The mid-IR colours of AGN are therefore redder than those of galaxies defining a characteristic wedge.\nDifferent combinations of mid-IR colours have been proposed to select AGN (e.g. Lacy et al. 2004, Stern et al.\n\n\f10\n\nI.

We see that\nall power-law SED fall within the wedge. However, there is\nalso an appreciable number of DOGs which fall leftwards\n\nof the wedge close to the region of the parameter space\noccupied by Arp220 at high redshifts.

(2009a) present HST images of 31 DOGs. All but one\nof their DOGs (which follow AGN mid-IR SEDs) present\nspatially extended emission, but also 90% show significant\nunresolved components.\n\n7. Discussion\n7.1. Overall Properties\n\nFig. 6. The Spitzer colour-colour diagram proposed\nto separate star-forming from AGN dominated DOGs.\nCircles (blue) and triangles (red) represent the DOGs in\nour sample having star-forming and AGN SEDs respectively. The solid line denotes the dividing line between\nAGN and star-forming galaxies at S8.0 /S4.5 = 2\n\nstar-forming galaxies. On the basis of their spectroscopic\nresults these authors propose a colour diagram for the selection of AGN. They find that AGN-dominated sources\nseparate very nicely at S8.0\u03bcm /S4.5\u03bcm = 2. We show this\ndiagnostic diagram for our sources in Fig. 6. Interestingly\nmost of our sources fall in the star-forming galaxy regime\nalthough the vast majority are bona-fide AGN on the basis\nof their high X-ray luminosity and high LX /L6\u03bcm ratio.\nBrusa et al. (2009b) reach similar conclusions by examining the Spitzer colours of obscured AGN in the 1Ms CDFS\nobservation.\n\n6.4. Optical Properties\nIn Fig. 8 we plot optical cutouts of the DOGs. The optical\nimages are the combined B435 -V606 -I775 -z850 frames from\nthe HST-ACS survey in order to increase the signal-tonoise ratio. For CDF-S sources there are HST detections\nfor all the sources in Grazian et al. (2006). In the north we\nare able to retrieve only 10/12 sources as there are no HST\ncounterparts for CDFN-140 and CDFN-307 in Giavalisco\net al. (2004). In Table 6 we give the HST counterparts for\nthe X-ray sources. For the detected sources we are able\nto inspect the morphology for many of them (typically\nwhen z850 < 26.5). The sources for which we are able\nto check the morphology are core-dominated but there\nis a circumnuclear structure in a large fraction of them\n(\u223c 2/3).\n\nWe investigate the properties of 26 X-ray selected DOGs\nin the CDF-N and CDF-S. Their redshifts (at least for\nthe 22 DOGs for which there are available spectroscopic\nor photometric redshifts available) strongly cluster around\nz \u223c 2.3. Although the uncertainties are admittedly high,\nas only four objects have a spectroscopic redshift available, this finding comes in good agreement with the results of Pope et al. (2008) and Dey et al. (2008). Dey et\nal. (2008) measure spectroscopic redshifts for 86 DOGs in\nthe Bootes field finding a redshift distribution centred at\nz=1.99. Pope et al. (2008) present mid-IR spectroscopy\nfor a sample of 12 (out of 79) Spitzer-selected DOGs in\nGOODS-N, finding that the spectra lie in a tight distribution around z \u223c 2. We find that all our sources have\nLIR > 1012 L and thus are classified as ULIRGs. The\nuncertainties in the estimations of the total IR luminosities, based on only IRAC and MIPS data, are expected\nto be within a factor of 3 (see Dey et al. 2008, Bussmann\net al. 2009b). This has to do with the fact that there are\nno far-IR or sub-mm measurements available (apart from\none source) and thus the amount of cold dust available\nin these systems is uncertain. Bussman et al. (2009b) using SHARC-II 350 \u03bcm imaging of 12 DOGs in the Bootes\nfield, estimate IR luminosities 2 \u00d7 1013 L , higher than\nother classes of dusty z \u223c 2 galaxy populations such as\nsub-mm galaxies.\nThe vast majority of our sources are most probably\nhosting an AGN owing to the large X-ray luminosities\n(L2\u221210 > 3 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121 ) and high LX /L6\u03bcm luminosity ratios (with the possible exception of the sources\nCDFN-317 and CDFS-309 see the discussion in section\n6.2). However, the mid-IR SEDs fail to reveal the presence of an AGN in many cases, suggesting that the AGN\ndoes not dominate the IR bolometric output. Only seven\nsources follow a power-law flux distribution suggestive of a\nbroad range of warm dust temperatures similar to that observed in AGN dominated sources. The Mkn231 ULIRG\ntemplate provides a good representation of these SEDs.\nBussmann et al. (2009b) also find the same for their DOGs\nwith sub-mm observations. The majority of our sources\nshow a bump in their flux distribution which is suggestive\nof a stellar continuum peaking at rest-frame wavelength\n\n\f12\n\nI.

(2008) is log[\u03bdL\u03bd (8\u03bcm)] = 12\n(\u03c3 = 0.64) while in our sample the luminosities are somewhat lower with log[\u03bdL\u03bd (6\u03bcm)] = 12 (\u03c3 = 1).\n\n7.2. Comparison with other X-ray observations of\nDOGs\nLanzuisi et al. (2009) have recently performed an Xray study of luminous DOGs (F24\u03bcm /FR > 2000 and\nF24\u03bcm > 1.3 mJy ) in the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared\nExtragalactic (SWIRE) survey. An area of 6deg2 out of\nthe total 50deg2 of the SWIRE survey has been surveyed\nby XMM-Newton or Chandra. Their sample includes 44\nDOGs in the redshift range 0.7 < z < 2.5 of which\n23 are detected in X-rays. These DOGs appear to be\nhighly absorbed with about 50% having a column density NH > 1023 cm\u22122 while one source is associated with\na transmission dominated Compton-thick QSO. In comparison, in our sample out of the 18 objects with available\nredshifts and in which we were able to perform spectral\n\nfits, 11 have NH > 1023 cm\u22122 . It appears that despite\nthe fact that the SWIRE sample is much brighter (its median flux is \u223c 1 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ), the fraction of\nhighly absorbed sources (> 1023 cm\u22122 ) is not very different compared to our sample. However, the fraction of\ncandidate Compton-thick sources is substantially higher\nin our fainter sample.\nFiore et al. (2009) investigate the X-ray properties of\nbright 24\u03bcm sources in the COSMOS survey (Elvis et al.\n2009). They select 73 DOGs of which 31 are detected in Xrays having a mean luminosity of log[L( 2 \u2212 10keV)] \u2248 43.5\nat a mean redshift z=1.55. The hardness ratio of these\nsources is 0.50 \u00b1 0.34 in the 0.3-1.5 vs. 1.5-6 keV bands\ncorresponding to a photon index of \u0393 \u223c 0.5. This hardness\nratio is identical to that of the remaining 42 non-detected\nDOGs (0.53\u00b10.14). The spectrum of the COSMOS DOGs\nis harder but consistent within the errors with the derived\naverage spectrum of the DOGs in or sample.\nGeorgakakis et al. (2010) follow a different approach\nfor identifying DOGs. They identify lower (spectroscopic)\nredshift z \u2248 1 sources in the AEGIS and CDFN surveys\nwhich are analogues to the distant DOG population at\nz \u223c 2. That is their SED are similar to these of DOGs\nso if placed at redshift of z=2 they would classify as\nDOGs. They find nine such sources with X-ray counter-\n\n\fI.

Georgantopoulos et al.: X-ray DOGs in the CDFs\n\nther the X-ray detected or undetected population of DOG\nanalogues. As far as the X-ray detections are concerned,\nour findings are not that discrepant quantitatively, given\nthat our fraction of Compton-thick sources is 4/12 among\nthe brightest sources.\n\n7.3. Comparison with X-ray undetected DOGs\nFiore et al. (2008) examine the properties of DOGs in\nthe CDF-S area which are undetected in the X-ray image. They find that the SEDs of most of these DOGs\nare dominated by AGN emission. The stacking analysis\nyields a hardness ratio corresponding to a flat spectral\nindex of \u0393 \u223c 1. They conclude that 80 \u00b1 15 % of these\nare likely to be highly obscured, Compton-thick AGN.\nGeorgantopoulos et al. (2008) have performed the same\nexercise in the Chandra Deep Field North finding a similar hardness ratio corresponding to a spectral index for\nthe undetected DOG (\u0393 \u2248 0.8). The average flux of the\nundetected DOGs in the CDF-N is f2\u221210keV \u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u221217\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (as compared to f2\u221210keV \u223c 9 \u00d7 10\u221216\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 for the detected ones in this work). Fiore\net al. (2009) look for X-ray undetected DOGs in the\nChandra-COSMOS survey (Elvis et al. 2009). They claim\nthat the number density of Compton-thick QSOs associated with DOGs is about half of all X-ray selected\nQSOs. Finally, Treister et al. (2009b) examine the properties of 211 heavily obscured AGN candidates in the\nExtended CDF-S selecting objects with f24\u03bcm /fR > 1000\nand R \u2212K > 4.5. 18 sources are detected in X-rays having\nmoderate column densities \u223c 1022\u221223 cm\u22122 while two of\nthem appear to be Compton-thick. On the other hand the\nundetected sources show a hard average spectrum which\ncould be interpreted as a mixture of 90% Compton-thick\nobjects and 10% star-forming galaxies. It should be kept\nin mind though that as only an average hardness ratio\ncan be derived in the stacking analysis one cannot definitively rule out the possibility that some of the sources\nare moderately absorbed (\u223c 1023 cm\u22122 at z=2) instead\nof intrinsically flat. Our work here, which examines the\nindividual X-ray spectra of the (albeit brighter) X-ray detected DOGs can provide an answer to this question. We\nfind a mixed bag of objects. At least four out of the 22\nsources with derived spectra are good candidates for being\nreflection dominated Compton-thick sources. At most 12\nsources could be intrinsically flat and thus Compton-thick\ncandidates but unfortunately the limited photon statistics do not allow us to discern between an intrinsically\nflat spectrum or a moderately absorbed one. At the same\ntime a large number of DOGs present relatively steep spectra (\u0393 > 1.4) and thus are unambiguously associated with\nunabsorbed sources. One could argue that the X-ray detected DOGs are expected to be less absorbed compared\nto the undetected ones. This is simply because larger column densities diminish the X-ray flux making the sources\nfainter than the CDF X-ray flux limit. Yet it is interesting\nthat the detected DOGs have an X-ray spectrum very sim-\n\nilar to the stacked spectrum of undetected DOGs (\u0393 \u223c 1)\nor flatter. Since a significant number of the X-ray detected\nDOGs in the CDFs are showing moderate absorption, it\nis not unlikely that undetected DOGs follow a similar absorption pattern. Nevertheless there is a significant difference between the X-ray detected and the undetected\nDOGs. The former have an X-ray to mid-IR luminosity\nratio of L2\u221210keV /L6\u03bcm \u2248 \u22121.3 (median) while the latter\nhave L2\u221210keV /L6\u03bcm \u2248 \u22123 (see Fig.2 of Georgakakis et al.\n2010). This could imply that the samples of undetected\nDOGs indeed contain a large fraction of Compton-thick\nsources. Then the fact that the average spectrum of the\nX-ray detected DOGs is comparable to that of undetected\nDOGs is a mere coincidence. Alternatively, there may be\na large contamination of the X-ray undetected DOG samples from normal galaxies. Galaxies in the local Uninerse\nare known to have low X-ray to mid-IR luminosity ratios\n(Ranalli et al. 2003).\n\n8. Summary\nThe mid-IR excess techniques have attracted much attention for claiming to be able to select Compton-thick\nAGN in a very efficient way. Here, we present a sample of 26 X-ray detected infrared-excess sources (DOGs)\nin the Chandra Deep Fields having f24\u03bcm /fR > 1000.\nWe examine their properties attempting to address the\nCompton-thick content of this sample mainly using X-ray\nspectroscopy. Our conclusions can be summarised as follows.\n\u2013 We find that an appreciable fraction of the DOGs (7\nout of 22) are associated with relatively unobscured\nsources, having \u0393 > 1.4. These are unobscured AGN\nrather than normal galaxies as confirmed by their high\nX-ray luminosities.\n\u2013 We identify a number of intrinsically flat \u0393 < 1 sources:\n4 out of the 12 with good photon statistics. These could\nbe associated with Compton-thick AGN. If we include\nthe sources with poorer photon statistics, the number\nof flat sources could be as many as 12 out of 26. In this\nrespect we find that the infrared-excess techniques can\nindeed unveil a significant number of heavily obscured\nAGN at high redshifts.\n\u2013 The fraction of Compton-thick sources could then vary\nroughly from 30% to 50%. This is clearly lower than\nreported in previous studies of stacking analysis of Xray undetected DOG samples.\n\u2013 The average spectrum of the X-ray detected DOGs\nis very similar if not harder than that of undetected\nDOGs in the Chandra Deep Fields.\nAcknowledgements.
