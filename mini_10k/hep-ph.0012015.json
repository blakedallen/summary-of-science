The data for the J/\u03c8 multiplicity in Pb+Pb collisions at\n158 A*GeV are used for the model prediction of the open charm yield. We find a strong enhancement\nof the open charm production, by a factor of about 2\u20134, over the standard hard-collision model\nextrapolation from nucleon-nucleon to nucleus-nucleus collisions. A possible mechanism of the open\ncharm enhancement in A+A collisions at the SPS energies is proposed.\n\nThe charmonium states J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 have been measured in nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions at CERN SPS\nover the last 15 years by the NA38 and NA50 Collaborations. This experimental program was motivated by\na suggestion [1] to use the J/\u03c8 as a probe of the state\nof matter created in the early stage of the collision. In\nthis approach a significant suppression of J/\u03c8 production relative to Drell\u2013Yan lepton pairs is predicted when\ngoing from peripheral to central Pb+Pb interactions at\n158 A*GeV. This is originally attributed to the formation\nof a quark-gluon plasma, but could be also explained in\nmicroscopic hadron models as secondary collision effects\n(see [2] and references therein).\nThe statistical approach, formulated in Ref. [3], assumes that J/\u03c8 mesons are created at hadronization according to the available hadronic phase-space similar to\nother (lighter) hadrons. We call this a hadron gas (HG)\nmodel. The HG model offers a natural explanation of\nthe proportionality of the J/\u03c8 and pion yields in nuclear\ncollisions.\nRecently a picture of the J/\u03c8 creation via coalescence\n(recombination) of charmed quarks was developed within\nseveral model approaches [4\u20137]. Similar to the HG model\n[3], the charmonium states are assumed to be formed at\nthe hadronization stage. However, they are produced\nas a coalescence of created earlier c and c quarks and\ntherefore the multiplicities of open and hidden charm\nhadrons are connected in the coalescence models. In\nRef. [5] the charm quark-antiquark pairs are assumed\nto be created at the early stage of A+A collision and\ndir\n,\nthe average number of directly produced c-c pairs, Ncc\nis fixed by the model consideration based on the hard\nscattering approach. This requires the introduction of a\nnew parameter in the HG approach \u2013 the charm enhancement factor \u03b3c [5]. This is analogous to the introduction\nof the strangeness suppression factor \u03b3s [8] in the HG\nmodel, where the total strangeness observed is smaller\nthan its thermal equilibrium value. Within this approach\nthe open charm hadron yield is enhanced by a factor \u03b3c\nand the charmonium yield by a factor \u03b3c2 in comparison\nwith the equilibrium HG predictions.\n\nAs the total number of charmed hadrons is expected to\nbe smaller than unity, even for the most central Pb+Pb\ncollisions at the SPS energy, an exact charm conservation within the canonical ensemble (c.e.) should be imposed. This has been done in Ref. [9]. Note also that\nthe c.e. formulation was successfully used in Ref. [10]\nto calculate the open charm hadron abundances in e+ e\u2212\ncollisions with an experimental input of the total open\ncharm production.\nIn this letter we consider the c.e. formulation [9] of\nthe statistical coalescence model [5]. The experimental\nvalue of the J/\u03c8 multiplicity hJ/\u03c8i will be used to predict\nthe open charm yield within the statistical coalescence\nmodel. We find a strong enhancement of the open charm\nproduction, by a factor of about 3, over the standard\nhard-collision model extrapolation from nucleon-nucleon\nto A+A collisions.\nIn the grand canonical ensemble (g.c.e.) the thermal\nmultiplicities of both open charm and charmonium states\nare given as (Bose and Fermi effects are negligible):\nNj =\n\n\u0010m \u0011\ndj V e\u03bcj /T\nj\n,\nT m2j K2\n2\n2\u03c0\nT\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V and T correspond to the volume\u2217 and temperature of HG system, mj , dj denote particle masses and degeneracy factors and K2 is the modified Bessel function.\nThe particle chemical potential \u03bcj in Eq.(1) is defined as\n\u03bcj = b j \u03bcB + s j \u03bcS + c j \u03bcC ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere bj , sj , cj denote the baryonic number strangeness\nand charm of particle j. The baryonic chemical potential \u03bcB regulates the baryonic density of the HG system\nwhereas strange \u03bcS and charm \u03bcC chemical potentials\nshould be found from the requirement of zero value for\nthe total strangeness and charm in the system (in our\n\n\u2217\n\nTo avoid further complications we use ideal HG formulae\nand neglect excluded volume corrections.\n\n1\n\n\fconsideration we neglect small effects of a non-zero electrical chemical potential).\nIn the c.e. formulation (i.e. when the requirement of\nzero \"charm charge\" of the HG is used in the exact form)\nthe thermal charmonium multiplicities are still given by\nEq.(1) as charmonium states have zero charm charge.\nThe multiplicities (1) of open charm hadrons will, however, be multiplied by the additional 'canonical suppression' factor (see e.g. [11]). This suppression factor is the\nsame for all individual open single charm states. It leads\nto the total open charm multiplicity NOce in the c.e.:\nNOce = NO\n\nI1 (NO )\n,\nI0 (NO )\n\nA reliable extraction of the J/\u03c8 yields from the published data appears to be non-trivial\u2020 . The results for\nhJ/\u03c8i presented in Ref. [3] were evaluated from the data\nof the NA50 Collaboration [13] using the procedure described in [14]. These results are presented in Table 1 to\nbe used in the present analysis.\nWe use the set of the chemical freeze-out parameters\n[15]:\nT = 168 MeV, \u03bcB = 266 MeV .\n\nThey are fixed by fitting the HG model to the hadron\nyield data in Pb+Pb collisions at 158 A*GeV (the inclusion of open charm and charmonium states does not\nmodify the rest of the hadron yields). For a fixed number of participants, Np , the volume V is calculated from\nNp = V nB , where nB = nB (T, \u03bcB ) is the baryonic density calculated in the g.c.e.. With the chemical freeze-out\ntot\nparameters (8) we find the NJ/\u03c8\nand NO values using\ndir\nEq.(1). Then we calculate \u03b3c from Eq.(5). Finally, Ncc\nis calculated from Eq.(4). Note that T \u223c\n170\nMeV\nleads\n=\nto the HG value of the thermal ratio of h\u03c8 \u2032 i/hJ/\u03c8i \u223c\n= 0.04\nin agreement with data [16] at Np > 100. This fact was\nfirst noticed in Ref. [17].\n\n(3)\n\nwhere NO is the total g.c.e. multiplicity of all open\ncharm and anticharm mesons and (anti)baryons calculated with Eq.(1) and I0 , I1 are the modified Bessel functions. For large open charm multiplicity NO >> 1 one\nfinds I1 (NO )/I0 (NO ) \u2192 1 and therefore NOce \u2192 NO , i.e.\nthe g.c.e. and c.e. results coincide. For NO << 1 one has\nI1 (NO )/I0 (NO ) \u223c\n= NO /2 and NOce \u223c\n= NO * NO /2, therece\nfore, NO is strongly suppressed (like NO /2, NO << 1)\nin comparison to the g.c.e. result, NO .\nAssuming the presence of the charm enhancement factor \u03b3c the statistical coalescence model within the c.e. is\nformulated as:\ndir\n=\nNcc\n\n1\nI1 (\u03b3c NO )\n\u03b3c N O\n+ \u03b3c2 NH ,\n2\nI0 (\u03b3c NO )\n\nThe model results for central Pb+Pb interactions at\n158 A*GeV (Np = 100 \u00f7 400) are presented in Table 1.\ndir\nscales as Np\u03b1 we find \u03b1 \u223c\nAssuming that Ncc\n= 1.7. This\nvalue is larger than \u03b1 \u223c\n4/3\nexpected\nin\nthe\nhard-collision\n=\nmodel.\ndir\npQCD inspired models suggest values of Ncc\u0304\n= 0.15 \u00f7\n0.3 in central Pb+Pb collisions at 158 A*GeV (a value of\ndir \u223c\nNcc\u0304\n= 0.17 is estimated in Ref. [5]). The results presented in Table 1 correspond to an enhancement of the\nopen charm production by a factor of about 2\u20134. Altot\nthough the values of NJ/\u03c8\n, NO and \u03b3c are rather sensitive\nto the temperature parameter, the model predictions for\ndir\nNcc\u0304\nremain essentially unchanged when T = 170 \u00b1 10\nMeV is used. Note that a recent analysis of the dimuon\nspectrum measured in central Pb+Pb collisions at 158\nA*GeV by NA50 Collaboration [18] suggests a significant\nenhancement of dilepton production in the intermediate\nmass region (1.5\u00f72.5 GeV) over the standard sources.\nThe primary\u2021 interpretation attributes this observation\nto the enhanced production of open charm [18]: about\n3 times above the pQCD prediction for the open charm\nyield in Pb+Pb collisions at SPS. This value is in agreement with our model analysis. Moreover, the analysis of\nthe centrality dependence of the dimuon excess was done\nin Ref. [4] assuming that additional dimuon pairs come\n\n(4)\n\nwhen NH is the total (thermal) multiplicity of particles with hidden charm. Therefore, the baryonic number, strangeness and electric charge of the HG system\nare treated in our approach according to the g.c.e. but\ncharm is considered in the c.e. formulation where the\nexact charge conservation is imposed.\nWe will proceed with Eq.(4) in the following way. As\nthe hJ/\u03c8i multiplicities can be extracted from the NA50\ndata on Pb+Pb collisions at 158 A*GeV for different values of Np , we start from the requirement:\ntot\nhJ/\u03c8i = \u03b3c2 NJ/\u03c8\n,\n\n(5)\n\nto fix the \u03b3c factor. In Eq.(5) the total J/\u03c8 thermal\nmultiplicity is calculated as\ntot\nNJ/\u03c8\n= NJ/\u03c8 + R(\u03c8 \u2032 )N\u03c8\u2032\n+R(\u03c71 )N\u03c71 + R(\u03c72 )N\u03c72 ,\n\n(8)\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere NJ/\u03c8 , N\u03c8\u2032 , N\u03c71 , N\u03c72 are given by Eq.(1) and\nR(\u03c8 \u2032 ) \u223c\n= 0.14 are the decay\n= 0.27, R(\u03c72 ) \u223c\n= 0.54, R(\u03c71 ) \u223c\nbranching ratios of the excited charmonium states into\nJ/\u03c8. Eq.(4) will be used then to calculate the value of\ndir\n. This value will be considered as a prediction of the\nNcc\nstatistical coalescence model: the open charm yield has\nnot yet been measured in Pb+Pb collisions at SPS.\n\n\u2020\n\nWe are thankful to M. Ga\u017adzicki and K. Redlich for useful\ncomments.\n\u2021\nAlternative explanations are also suggested [19\u201321].\n\n2\n\n\fentirely from decays of D and D\u0304. The open charm yield\nwas found to be proportional to Np1.7 . This precisely coincides with our result.\nA possible source of the open charm enhancement in\nA+A collisions with respect to the direct extrapolation\nfrom p+p data may be the broadening of the phase space\navailable for the open charm due to the presence of the\nhadron and/or the quark-gluon medium:\nLet a cc\u0304 pair with an invariant mass below the open\ncharm threshold, 2MD \u223c\n= 3.7 GeV, be created in a p+p\ncollision. In the vacuum it cannot hadronize to an open\ncharm hadron pair and thus it has to be transformed into\nnon-charmed states to respect energy-momentum conservation. In A+A collisions, however, such a pair has a\nchance to shift its invariant mass above the open charm\nthreshold due to secondary interactions with hadron\nand/or quark-gluon medium, thus resulting in additional\nopen charm production. The strongest enhancement of\nthe open charm production should be expected in the\nquark-gluon plasma. Due to the Debye screening, c and\nc\u0304 behave like free particles. Therefore, almost all subthreshold cc\u0304-pairs created in the hard collisions hadronize\ninto open charm mesons and baryons at the later stage\nof the A+A reaction. This effect can be substantial at\nmoderate center-of-mass energies per nucleon, while at\nhigher energies the threshold effects becomes less important. A quantitative estimate of this effect is under way\n[22]. The above mechanism does not alter the production\nof direct Drell-Yan pairs: both the threshold effects and\nthe interaction with the nuclear medium are negligible in\nthat case.\n\nL.

The\ncanonical ensemble suppression effects are important for\nthe thermal open charm yield even at Np \u223c\n= 400. These\neffects become crucial when the number of participants\nNp decreases. From the J/\u03c8 multiplicity data in Pb+Pb\ncollisions at 158 A*GeV the open charm yield is predicted:\ndir\nNcc\u0304\n= 0.6 \u00f7 0.7\n\nin central collisions. This is about a factor 3 above the\npQCD prediction for the open charm yield in Pb+Pb\ncollisions at SPS. The statistical coalescence model predir\ndicts also an Np dependence of Ncc\u0304\n\u223c Np1.7 , which is\n4/3\n\nstronger than the standard dependence, Np , in the\nhard-collision model. These predictions of the statistical coalescence model can be tested in the near future at\nthe CERN SPS, where measurements of the open charm\nare planned.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are thankful to F.
