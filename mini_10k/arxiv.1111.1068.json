Confining elements are a peltier element at 250 K (bottom), a liquid nitrogen reservoir\nat 77 K (top) and the surrounding vacuum chamber at 293 K. Particle levitation and trapping is\nmodeled by an interplay of thermophoresis, photophoresis and gravity. A number of ice particles\nare trapped simultaneously in close spatial distance to each other at least up to minutes and are\naccessible for further experiments.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIce particles are a major component in the Earth atmosphere and are important for the energy budget and\nclimate [1]. More general, ice is important in planetary\natmospheres and in a wider range of astrophysical environments [2]. The microphysics of ice particles, e.g. formation or optical properties are regularly studied in large\nscale simulations [3]. Individual ice particles have also\nbeen studied trapped in an electrodynamic balance [4].\nAn important pressure range for stratospheric and mesospheric particles is the mbar regime. The low pressure\nrange is also required to study photophoresis in detail\nwhich has recently gained importance in protoplanetary\ndisks [5]. This pressure range is intrinsically difficult for\nPaul traps due to voltage break throughs.\nWe present here a new kind of particle trap based on\nthermophoretic, photophoretic and gravitational forces.\nThe trap is capable of levitating ice particles at least up\nto 100\u03bcm in size at absolute pressures of a few mbar. The\ntrap is static, i.e. does not require alternating fields like\nfor electrodynamic trapping and does not require a feedback loop. Besides trapping particles for further studies\n(i.e. optical properties) it immediately allows to determine the photophoretic strength on the particles induced\nby thermal radiation, to determine the aerodynamical\nbehaviour and to quantify thermophoretic forces. The\ntrapped ice particles levitate at least up to minutes at\na specific position and are easily accessible. In addition,\ntens of ice particles can be trapped simultaneously in\nclose spatial distance to each other which allows experiments like inducing collisional interaction. As such we\nconsider this experiment to be not only a tool but to be\nof fundamental importance for a number of branches in\nphysics.\nThe experiment is based on forces induced by temperature gradients. The motion of a particle along a temperature gradient in a gaseous environment is called thermophoresis [6]. Related to this is a force on the particle,\nwhere a temperature gradient exists along the particle\nin a gaseous environment where the gas is at constant\n\ntemperature. Such a gradient is often induced by radiation, therefore the effect is called photophoresis [7]. Small\nparticles suspended in a rarefied gas with a temperature\ngradient being present one way or the other are accelerated by a thermophoretic and/or photophoretic force in\ngeneral in the direction from hot to cold.\nThermophoresis and photophoresis are the result of the\ninteraction between the gas molecules and the particle's\nsurface. Gas molecules colliding with the particle surface, accomodate to the local temperature and leave with\na thermal velocity according to the surface temperature.\nFrom this a net momentum on the particle results. A detailed theory for thermophoresis and photophoresis exist\nfor spherical particles [6\u20139]. Many parameters within this\ntheory are not easily accessible for calculations, i.e. the\nabsorption and heat transfer within the particle or the\naccomodation coefficient are needed which are physical\nproblems of their own. In reality particles are also far\naway from being perfect spheres with well defined sizes\n(see also Fig.2) and correction factors have to be applied.\nThese are currently unknown. If thermophoretic and\nphotophoretic forces are directed upwards they might offset gravity and lead to the levitation of particles. In such\na stable case the forces can directly be modelled and the\nparticle can be subjected to further research. To provide stable levitation the lifting phoretic forces have to\ndecrease with height and a sideward confining force is\nneeded to prevent a sideward drift. We also considered\nconvection but convection is too slow in our case and is\nnot important for the trapping principle. However, gas\ndrag is providing damping for a particle trajectory and\nrotation and allows to determine aerodynamical properties.\n\nSETUP AND OBSERVATIONS\n\nFig.1 shows the principle setup of the experiment and\nFig.2 is an example of levitated ice particles.

The chamber is\nevacuated to 0.1\u221210 mbar.

The cold bottom of a container filled with liquid nitrogen (T1 \u2243 77 K) is located\n25 mm above the peltier element. The chamber is evacuated to pressures between 0.1 \u2212 10 mbar. Ice particles are\nejected spontaneously from the ice surface at mbar pressure. This might be due to the photophoretic ejection\nmechanism discussed in [10] and [11]. After the particles are ejected, in general two different types of particle\ntrajectories are observed (Fig.3). Most particles continuously rise with their velocity varying with height. They\nare decelerated in the lower part of their trajectory but\nare accelerated once they reach a certain height. The\nother fraction of particles comes to rest about half the\nway between bottom and top and is trapped for at least\na few minutes. Tens of particles can be trapped at the\nsame time. The sizes of the levitated particles roughly\nvary between 10 and 100 \u03bcm. The lower limit is set by the\nresolution of the camera. A minor fraction of particles\nfall back to the snow surface. Most levitating particles\nrotate about the vertical axis [12].\n\nWe consider thermophoresis, photophoresis, gravity\nand gas drag here. While thermophoresis directly depends on the temperature gradient between the peltier\nelement and the nitrogen container, photophoresis is induced by the thermal radiation I = \u03c3T 4 of the peltier\nelement and \u2013 once rising \u2013 by the surrounding warm\nchamber (293 K). The higher the particle ascends within\nthe gap between the peltier element and the nitrogen\ncontainer the more dominant is the ambient thermal radiation. Hence photophoresis gets stronger with height z.\nWe simulated the gas flow and temperature distribution\nwithin the chamber using a commercial software (Comsol\nMultiphysics 4).

Stable levitation should appear in the minimum of the sum of the forces which is in good agreement with\nthe experimental data (see Fig.3).\n\nwhere cd is the drag coefficient, m is the particle mass,\nv is the particles velocity and \u03c4 is the gas-grain coupling\ntime which can be expressed as [13]\n\u03c4 =\u03b5\n\nm 1\n,\n\u03c3 \u03c1g c\u0304\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nwith an empirical factor \u03b5, m as the particles mass,\n\u03c3 as the geomoetrical cross section of the particle, \u03c1g\nas the gas density.

In Fig.3 the experimental\ndata and the predictions of the theory are plotted. The\ntrajectories are reproduced by the model. For continuous\npropagation from the bottom to the top the gas drag\ncoefficient takes the value of cd = 0.03. From the model\nice particles should levitate approx. at half the distance\n(minimum of the force curve) between the peltier element\nand the nitrogen container which is in good agreement\nwith the experiments. Stable trapping is provided here\n\n\f4\nas the x, y-components of the thermophoretic force on\nthe ice particles yields from the warm vacuum chamber\nwalls inwards. This can be seen from the temperature\ngradient (Fig.5) at the levitation height. We note that\nthe observed stable trapping is offset from the center. We\nattribute this to the the low temperature gradient in the\ncenter and peculiarities of the setup, e.g. light sources,\nflanges and a square peltier element.\nAPPLICATION AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe showed that ice aggreagtes can be trapped and levitated by thermophoresis and photophoresis between two\nsurfaces at different temperatures in a vacuum chamber\nat room temperature. The levitated ice particles are in\ngeneral < 100 \u03bcm. Even groups of single ice particles can\nbe trapped in close spatial distance. The ice particles\nallow further experiments like detailed thermophoretic,\nphotophoretic or optical experiments. Also the thermal\nbehaviour of irregular shaped ice particles and the interaction between ice particles e.g. in collisions induced in a\ntrapped cloud can be studied. Possible applications are\nbasic physics on thermophoretic and photophoretic forces\nand their use in atmospheric science and astrophysics.\nFor the latter we currently explore the trap described\nhere as levitation mechanism in protoplanetary disks.\nWe thank Marc Boch for supporting the laboratory\nwork.
