Introduction\nConsider a compact oriented surface S of genus g \u2265 0 from which\nm \u2265 0 points, so-called punctures, have been deleted. The mapping\nclass group M(S) of S is, by definition, the space of isotopy classes of\norientation preserving homeomorphisms of S.\nThere are natural metric graphs on which the mapping class group\nM(S) acts by isometries. Among them, we will concern with the curve\ncomplex C(S) (or, rather, its one-skeleton) and train track complex\nT T (S).\nIn [Har81], Harvey defined the curve complex C(S) for S. The vertex\nof this complex is a free homotopy class of an essential simple closed\nDate: November 7, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 57M60.\nKey words and phrases. Mapping class group, Train track, Curve complex.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nKEITA IBARAKI\n\ncurve on S, i.e. a simple closed curve which is neither contractible nor\nhomotopic into a puncture. A k-simplex of C(S) is spun by a collection\nof k + 1 vertices which are realized by mutually disjoint simple closed\ncurves.\nThe train track which is an embedded 1-complex was invented by\nThurston [Thu78] and provides a powerful tool for the investigation\nof surfaces and hyperbolic 3-manifolds. A detailed account on train\ntracks can be found in the book [Pen92] of Penner with Harer.\nHamenst\u00e4dt defined in [Ham05a] that a train track is called complete\nif it is a bireccurent and each of complementary regions is either a\ntrigon or a once-punctured monogon. Hamenst\u00e4dt defined the train\ntrack complex T T (S) for S. Vertices of the train track complex are\nisotopy classes of complete train tracks on S.\nSuppose 3g \u2212 3 + m \u2265 2, i.e. S is a hyperbolic surfaces but neither a once-punctured torus nor 4-punctured sphere. Both the curve\ncomplex and the train track complex can be endowed with a pathmetric by declaring all edge lengths to be equal to 1. In these cases,\nthere are a map \u03a6 : T T (S) \u2192 C(S) and a number C > 0 such that\nd(\u03a6(\u03c4 ), \u03a6(\u03c4 \u2032 )) \u2264 Cd(\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) for all complete train track \u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 on S.\nIf S is a once-punctured torus or a 4-punctured sphere, then any\nessential simple closed curve must intersect, so that C(S) has no edge\nby definition. However, Minsky [Min96] adopt a small adjustment in\nthe definition for curve complex in these two particular case so that it\nbecomes a sensible and familiar 1-complex: two vertices are connected\nby an edge when the curves they represent have minimal intersection\n(1 in the case of a once-punctured torus, and 2 in the case of a 4punctured sphere). It turns out that in both cases, the complex is the\nFarey graph F .\nIn addition, if S is a once-punctured torus, there is no complete train\ntrack under Hamenst\u00e4dt's definition and T T (S) is homeomorphic to\nempty set. We thus adopt here Penner's definition [Pen92], i.e. the\ntrain track \u03c4 is complete iff \u03c4 is bireccurent and is not a proper subtrack\nof any birecurrent train track. These two definitions are equivalent\nexcept for the once-punctured torus.\nOur main theorem is:\nTheorem 1.1. Suppose S is a once-punctured torus or a 4-punctured\nsphere. Then the train track complex T T (S) of S is quasi-isometric to\nthe dual graph of the Farey graph F (see Figure1).\nMore precisely, if S is a once-punctured torus, we show:\nTheorem 1.2. The train track complex of a once-punctured torus\nis isomorphic to the Caley graph of P SL(2, Z) = hr, l | (lr \u22121 l)2 =\n1, (lr \u22121 )3 = 1i.\nIn [Ham05a], Hamenst\u00e4dt also shows that if 3g \u2212 3 + m \u2265 2 the\nmapping class group M(S) acts p.d.c., i.e. properly discontinuously\n\n\fTRAIN TRACK COMPLEX\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. dual of the Farey graph\nand cocompactly, on the train track complex T T (S) and M(S) is\nquasi-isometric to T T (S). We can prove that the same is true for the\nonce-punctured torus and 4-punctured sphere.\nCorollary 1.3. Suppose S is the once-punctured torus or 4-punctured\nsphere. Then M(S) acts p.d.c. on T T (S).\nCorollary 1.4. Suppose S is the once-punctured torus or 4-punctured\nsphere. Then M(S) is quasi-isometric to T T (S).\nIn Section 2, we give a brief review of quasi-isometries. In Section 3,\nwe describe train tracks and define the train track complex. In Section\n4, we describe how to build a Farey graph which is used for curve\ncomplex of a once-punctured torus or a 4-punctured sphere. In Section\n5 and 6, we prove the Theorem1.1. Finally, we describe the action of\nmapping class groups on train track complexes in Section 7.\n2. Quasi-Isometry\nA quasi-isometry is one of the fundamental notion in geometric group\ntheory. For details, see [Bow06].\nLet (X, d) be a proper geodesic space, i.e. a complete and locally\ncompact geodesic space. Given x \u2208 X and r \u2265 0, write N(x, r) =\n{y \u2208 X | d(x, y) \u2264 r} for\nS the closed r-neighborhood of x in X. If\nA \u2286 X, write N(A, r) = x\u2208A N(x, r). We say that A is cobounded if\nX = N(A, r) for some r \u2265 0.\nSuppose that a group \u0393 acts on X by isometry. Given x \u2208 X, we\nwrite \u0393x = {gx | g \u2208 \u0393} for the orbit of x under \u0393, and stab(x) = {g \u2208\n\u0393 | gx = x} for its stabilizer.\n\n\f4\n\nKEITA IBARAKI\n\nWe say that the action of \u0393 on X is properly discontinuous if for\nall r \u2265 0 and all x \u2208 X, the set {g \u2208 \u0393 | d(x, gx) \u2264 r} is finite. A\nproperly discontinuous action is called cocompact if X/\u0393 is compact.\nWe will frequently abbreviate \"properly discontinuous and cocompact\"\nby p.d.c.\nProposition 2.1 ([Bow06]). The followings are equivalent:\n(i) The action is cocompact,\n(ii) Some orbit is cobounded, and\n(iii) Every orbit is cobounded.\nProof. Write N \u2032 (\u0393x, r) for a closed r-neighborhood of \u0393x in X/\u0393. Let\n\u03c0 : X \u2192 X/\u0393 be a quotient map, Then for any x \u2208 X and any r > 0\n\u03c0(N(x, r)) = N \u2032 (\u0393x, r) and \u03c0 \u22121 (N \u2032 (\u0393x, r)) = N(\u0393x, r).\n\u2022 (iii) \u21d2 (ii) is clear.\n\u2022 Suppose that some orbit is cobounded. So, X = N(\u0393x, r)\nfor some x \u2208 X and some r > 0. Thus, X/\u0393 = \u03c0(X) =\n\u03c0(N(\u0393x, r)) = N \u2032 (\u0393x, r) = \u03c0(N(x, r)). By Proposition 3.1 of\n[Bow06], N(x, r) is compact and hence X/\u0393 = \u03c0(N(x, r)) is\nalso compact. Now we proved (ii) \u21d2 (i).\n\u2022 Suppose the action is cocompact. So, X/\u0393 is compact and\nhence X/\u0393 is bounded. Thus, for any x \u2208 X there is some\nr > 0, such that X/\u0393 = N \u2032 (\u0393x, r). Since X = \u03c0 \u22121 (X/\u0393) =\n\u03c0 \u22121 (N \u2032 (\u0393x, r)) = N(\u0393x, r), \u0393x is cobounded and (i) \u21d2 (iii) is\nshown.\n\u0003\nDefinition 2.2 (quasi-isometry). Let (X, d) and (Y, d\u2032 ) be metric spaces.\nA map \u03c6 : X \u2192 Y is called a quasi-isometry if there are constants\nk1 > 0, k2 , k3 , k4 \u2265 0 such that for all x1 , x2 \u2208 X,\nk1 d(x1 , x2 ) \u2212 k2 \u2264 d\u2032 (\u03c6(x1 ), \u03c6(x2 )) \u2264 k3 d(x1 , x2 ) + k4 ,\nand the image \u03c6(x) is cobounded in Y .\nThus, a quasi-isometry is bi-Lipshitz with bounded error and its\nimage is cobounded. We note that the quasi-isometry introduces an\nequivalence relation on the set of metric spaces.\nTwo metric spaces, X and Y , are said to be quasi-isometric if there\nis a quasi-isometry between them.\nLet X be a geodesic space and A a finite generating set for a group\n\u0393. Suppose \u2206(\u0393, A) is the Cayley graph of \u0393 with respect to A. If\nB is another generating set for \u0393, then \u2206(\u0393, A) is quasi-isometric to\n\u2206(\u0393, B). Thus, we simply denote the Cayley graph of \u0393 by \u2206(\u0393)\nwithout specifying a generating set. A group \u0393 acts p.d.c. on its\nCayley graph \u2206(\u0393).\nWe define that \u0393 is quasi-isometric to X if \u2206(\u0393) is quasi-isometric to\nX. Also, two groups \u0393, \u0393\u2032 are quasi-isometric if \u2206(\u0393) is quasi-isometric\nto \u2206(\u0393\u2032 ).\n\n\fTRAIN TRACK COMPLEX\n\n5\n\nThe proof of the following claims can be found for example in [Bow06]:\nTheorem 2.3 ([Bow06]). If \u0393 acts p.d.c. on a proper geodesic space\nX, then \u0393 is quasi-isometric to X.\nProposition 2.4. Let \u0393 be a finitely generated group. Suppose that\nG is a subgroup of \u0393 of finite index. Then G is finitely generated and\nquasi-isometric to \u0393.\n3. Train track complex\nA train track on S (see [Pen92]) is an embedded 1-complex \u03c4 \u2282 S\nwhose vertecis are called switches and edges are called branches. \u03c4 is C 1\naway from its switches. At any switch v the incident edges are mutually\ntangent and there is an embedding f : (0, 1) \u2192 \u03c4 with f (1/2) = v\nwhich is a C 1 map into S. The valence of each switch is at least 3,\nexcept possibly for one bivalent switch in a closed curve component.\nFinally, we require that every component D of S \u2212 \u03c4 has negative\ngeneralized Euler characteristic in the following sense: define \u03c7\u2032 (D) to\nbe the Euler characteristic \u03c7(D) minus 1/2 for every outward-pointing\ncusp (internal angle 0). For the train track complementary regions all\ncusps are outward, so that the condition \u03c7\u2032 (D) < 0 excludes annuli,\nonce-punctured disks with smooth boundary, or non-punctured disks\nwith 0, 1 or 2 cusps at the boundary. We will usually consider isotopic\ntrain-tracks to be the same.\nA train track is called generic if all switches are at most trivalent.\nA train route is a non-degenerate smooth path in \u03c4 ; in particular it\ntraverses a switch only by passing from incoming to outgoing edge\nor vice versa. The train track \u03c4 is called recurrent if every branch is\ncontained in a closed train route. The train track \u03c4 is called transversely\nrecurrent if every branch intersects transversely with a simple closed\ncurve c so that S \u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 c does not contain an embedded bigon, i.e.\na disc with two corners. A train track which is both recurrent and\ntransversely recurrent is called birecurrent.\nA curve c is carried by a transversely recurrent train track \u03c4 if there is\na carrying map F : S \u2192 S of class C 1 which is homotopic to the identity\nand maps c to \u03c4 in such a way that the restriction of its differential dF\nto every tangent line of c is non-singular. A train track \u03c4 \u2032 is carried by\n\u03c4 if there is a carrying map F and every train route on \u03c4 \u2032 is carried by\n\u03c4 with F .\nA generic birecurrent train track is called complete if it is not a proper\nsubtrack of any birecurrent train track.\nTheorem 3.1 ([Pen92]).\n(i) If g > 1 or m > 1, then any birecurrent train track on S is a subtrack of a complete train track,\neach of whose complementary region is either a trigon or a\nonce-punctured monogon.\n\n\f6\n\nKEITA IBARAKI\n\n(ii) Any birecurrent train track on a once-punctured torus is a subtrack of a complete train track whose unique complementary\nregion is a once-punctured bigon.\nIt follows:\nCorollary 3.2. Suppose \u03c4 is a complete train track on S of genus g\nwith m punctures. Then the number of switches of \u03c4 depends only on\nthe topological type of S.\nProof. If S is the once-punctured torus, then \u03c4 have 2 vertices.\nIn the other case, let nt be the number of triangle component of S\u2212\u03c4 ,\nns be the number of switches of \u03c4 and nb be the number of branches\nof \u03c4 . Since \u03c4 is generic, 2nb = 3ns . By Theorem 3.1, ns = 3nt + m.\nBy Euler characteristic, nt \u2212 nb + ns = 2 \u2212 2g \u2212 m. Now we get\nns = 4(3g \u2212 3 + m).\n\u0003\nA half-branch b\u0303 in a generic train track \u03c4 incident on a switch v is\ncalled large if the switch v is trivalent and if every arc \u03c1 : (\u03b5, \u03b5) \u2192 \u03c4 of\nclass C 1 which passes through v meets the interior of b\u0303. A branch b in\n\u03c4 is called large if each of its two half-branches is large; in this case b\nis necessarily incident to two distinct switches.\nThere is a simple way to modify a complete train track \u03c4 to another\ncomplete train track. Namely, if e is a large branch of \u03c4 then we can\nperform a right or left split of \u03c4 at e as shown in Figure 2. A complete\ntrain track \u03c4 can always be at least one of the left or right split at any\nlarge branch e to a complete train track \u03c4 \u2032 (see [Ham05b]). We note\nthat \u03c4 \u2032 is carried by \u03c4 .\nright split\na\n\nd\ne\n\nb\n\nc\nleft split\n\nFigure 2. a split\nDefinition 3.3 (train track complex). A train track complex T T (S) is\ndefined as follow: The set of vertices of T T (S) consists of all isotopy\nclasses of complete train tracks on S. Two Complete train tracks \u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032\nis connected with an edge if \u03c4 \u2032 can be obtained from \u03c4 by a single split.\nFor each switch v of \u03c4 , fix a direction of the tangent line to \u03c4 at v.\nThe branch b which is incident to v is called incoming if the direction\nat v coincides with the direction from b to v, and outgoing if not. A\n\n\fTRAIN TRACK COMPLEX\n\n7\n\ntransverse measure on \u03c4 is a non-negative function \u03bc on the set of\nbranches satisfying the switch condition : For any switch of \u03c4 the sums\nof \u03bc over incoming and outgoing branches are equal. A train track \u03c4\nis recurrent if and only if it supports a transverse measure which is\npositive on every branch (see [Pen92]).\nFor a recurrent train track \u03c4 the set P (\u03c4 ) of all transverse measures\non \u03c4 is a convex cone in a linear space. A vertex cycle (see [MM99])\non \u03c4 is a transverse measure \u03bc which spans an extremal ray in P (\u03c4 ).\nUp to scaling, a vertex cycle \u03bc is a counting measure of a simple closed\ncurve c which is carried by \u03c4 . This means that for a carrying map\nF : c \u2192 \u03c4 and every open branch b of \u03c4 the \u03bc-weight of \u03c4 equals the\nnumber of connected components of F \u22121 (b). We also use the notion, a\nvertex cycle, for the simple closed curve c.\nProposition 3.4 ([Ham05b]). Let \u03c4 be a complete train track. Suppose\nc is a vertex cycle on \u03c4 with a carrying map F . Then, F (c) passes\nthrough every branch of \u03c4 at most twice, and with different orientation\nif any.\nProposition 3.4 and Corollary 3.2 imply that the number of vertex\ncycles on a complete train track on S is bounded by a universal constant\n(see [MM99]). Moreover, there is a number D > 0 with the property\nthat for every complete train track \u03c4 on S the distance in C(S) between\nany two vertex cycles on \u03c4 is at most D (see [Ham05b], [MM04]).\n\n4. Farey graph\nLet S be the once-punctured torus or the 4-punctured sphere. The\nessential simple closed curves on S are well known to be in one-toone correspondence with rational numbers p/q with 1/0 = \u221e Thus\nthe 0-skeleton of C(S) is identified with Q\u0302 := Q \u222a {\u221e} in the circle\nS 1 = R \u222a \u221e.\nThere are numerous ways to build a Farey graph F , any of them produces an isomorphic graph. One can start with the rational projective\nline Q\u0302, identifying 0 with 0/1 and \u221e with 1/0, and take this to be the\nvertex set of F . Then, two projective rational numbers p/q, r/s \u2208 Q\u0302,\nwhere p and q are coprime and r and s are coprime, are deemed to\nspan an edge, or 1-simplex, if and only if |ps \u2212 rq| = 1. The result is\na connected graph in which every edge separates. The graph F can be\nrepresented on a disc; see Figure 3. We shall say a graph is a Farey\ngraph if it is isomorphic to F .\nNote that the curve complexes of a once-punctured torus and 4punctured sphere are Farey graphs (see [Min96][APS06]).\nRemark. The Farey graph F is quasi-isometric to the dual graph.\n\n\f8\n\nKEITA IBARAKI\n\nFigure 3. the Farey graph\n5. Train tracks on the once-punctured torus\nLet S1,1 be the once-punctured torus and \u03c4 a complete train track\non S1,1 . By Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.2, \u03c4 has the unique complementary region that is a once-punctured bigon and the number of\nswitches of \u03c4 equals 2. It follows that every complete train track on\nS1,1 is orientation preserving C 1 \u2013diffeomorphic to the one illustrated\nin Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4. complete train track on Once-punctured torus\n\u03c4 has exactly two vertex cycles c1 , c2 whose intersection number\ni(c1 , c2 ) equals 1. Thus, c1 and c2 is connected by an edge in Farey\ngraph. Conversely, if we fix simple closed curve c1 , c2 on S1,1 whose\nintersection number i(c1 , c2 ) equals 1, then there is only two complete\ntrain tracks whose vertex cycles are c1 and c2 .\nWrite V (G) for the vertex set of a graph G and E(G) for the set of\nall edges in G. We define a map \u03c6 : V (T T (S1,1 )) \u2192 E(F ) as follow:\n\n\fTRAIN TRACK COMPLEX\n\n9\n\nFigure 5. Splits of a complete train track on S1,1\nLet \u03c4 \u2208 S1,1 . Suppose c1 , c2 are vertex cycles on \u03c4 . We define \u03c6(\u03c4 ) as\nthe edge of F which connects c1 and c2 .\nWe construct the graph G1 of \u03c6 as follows: Let V (G1 ) = E(F ).\nWe connect vertices e1 , e2 \u2208 E(F ) if some \u03c41 \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (e1 ) and some\n\u03c42 \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (e2 ) are connected by an edge in T T (S1,1 ). \u03c6 can be naturally\nextended to \u03c6 : T T (S1,1 ) \u2192 G1 .\nLemma 5.1. G1 is quasi-isometric to the dual graph of the Farey\ngraph.\nProof. Suppose \u03c41 and \u03c42 are different complete train tracks on S1,1\nwhich have common vertex cycles c1 , c2 . \u03c41 have a unique large edge b\nand there are two complete train tracks \u03c41\u2032 , \u03c41\u2032\u2032 which are obtained by a\nleft or right split of \u03c41 at b (see Figure 5). We can see that one vertex\ncycle on \u03c41\u2032 is the same as c1 on \u03c41 , and the other vertex cycle c3 on\n\u03c41\u2032 intersects c2 on \u03c41 at one point. Thus \u03c6(\u03c41\u2032 ) and \u03c6(\u03c41 ) are adjacent\nedges in F . In this case, vertex cycles on \u03c41\u2032\u2032 are c2 and c3 . Hence \u03c6(\u03c41 ),\n\u03c6(\u03c41\u2032 ) and \u03c6(\u03c41\u2032\u2032 ) span a triangle on F . Similarly, we can get complete\ntrain tracks \u03c42\u2032 , \u03c42\u2032\u2032 by a split of \u03c42 , and \u03c6(\u03c42 ), \u03c6(\u03c42\u2032 ) and \u03c6(\u03c42\u2032\u2032 ) span\nanother triangle on F . (see Figure 6)\nThe mapping class group M(S1,1 ) acts isometrically on T T (S1,1 )\nand F and acts transitively on V (G1 ) = E(F ). It follows that every\nedge in G1 connects an adjacent edge of F and every adjacent edge of\nF is connected with a direct edge in G1 . Thus G1 is the line graph of\nthe dual of F , i.e. vertices of G1 represent edges of the dual of F and\ntwo vertices are adjacent iff their corresponding edges share a common\nendpoint (see Figure 7). It's now obvious that G1 is quasi-isometric to\nthe dual of the Farey graph.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.2. T T (S1,1 ) is connected.\n\n\f10\n\nKEITA IBARAKI\n\nFigure 7. G1\n\nFigure 6.\n\nProof. Let e \u2208 E(F ) and \u03c6\u22121 (e) := {\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 }. All we need is to show\nthat \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 are connected in T T (S1,1 ), since G1 is connected. \u03c4 can\nbe a right(left) split to a complete train track \u03c41 . Then, there is a\ncomplete train track \u03c42 which can be a right(left) split to \u03c4 \u2032 and can\nbe a left(right) split to \u03c41 (see Figure 8). Thus \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 are connected\nand d(\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) = 3.\n\u0003\n\nFigure 8.\nLemma 5.3. \u03c6 is a quasi-isometory.\nProof. Let \u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 V (T T (S1,1 )). Suppose \u03b1 is geodesic on G1 from \u03c6(\u03c4 )\nto \u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032 ). \u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (\u03b1) and diam(\u03c6\u22121 (\u03b1)) \u2264 4d(\u03c6(\u03c4 ), \u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032 )) + 3 since\n\n\fTRAIN TRACK COMPLEX\n\n11\n\ndiam(\u03c6\u22121 (e)) = 3 for any e \u2208 E(F ). Thus d(\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 ) \u2264 4d(\u03c6(\u03c4 ), \u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032 )) +\n3.\nIt follows that \u03c6 is a quasi-isometry.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.1(a once-puncture torus case). By Lemma 5.1 and\n5.3, T T (S1,1 ) is quasi-isometric to the dual graph of the Farey graph.\n\u0003\nT T (S1,1 ) is obtained by extending one vertex of G1 to two vertices.\nWhen we think the action of the mapping class group, we see that\nT T (S1,1 ) is isomorphic to the graph as in Figure 9. We can notice\nthat this graph is isomorphic to the Caley graph of P SL(2, Z) = hr, l |\n(lr \u22121 l)2 = 1, (lr \u22121 )3 = 1i, and thus Theorem 1.2 is proved.\n\nFigure 9.\n6. Train tracks on the 4-punctured sphere\nLet S0,4 be the 4-punctured sphere. A train track complex of S0,4 is\nsimilar to that of the once-punctured torus but more complicated.\nOrientation preserving C 1 \u2013diffeomorphism classes of a complete train\ntracks \u03c4 depends on combination of switches and branches. By Proposition 3.2, number of switches and branches of \u03c4 are constants. Thus,\nnumber of orientation preserving C 1 \u2013diffeomorphism classes of the complete train tracks is finite. In fact, complete train tracks on S0,4 are\nclassified into 13 classes, illustrated in (1) to (8) of Figure 10 and their\nmirror images, though (1), (4) and (8) can move these mirrors by orientation preserving C 1 -diffeomorphism.\nWe can see that all of those train tracks have exactly two vertex\ncycles c, c\u2032 whose intersection number i(c, c\u2032 ) equals 2 or 4.\n\n\f12\n\nKEITA IBARAKI\n\nFigure 10.\n\n\fTRAIN TRACK COMPLEX\n\n13\n\nFirst, we confirm connectivity of T T (S0,4 ):\nProposition 6.1. T T (S0,4 ) is connected.\nFirst we look at a C 1 \u2013diffeomorphism class which has two large edges\nand whose two vertex cycles intersect at two points ( (1) of Figure 10\n). We write A1 for the collection of these train tracks.\nLet \u03c4 \u2208 A1 . \u03c4 can split at two large edges b1 , b2 . We can get another\ncomplete train track \u03c41 by a right split \u03c4 at b1 (\u03c41 is C 1 \u2013diffeomorphic\nto (2) of Figure 10). \u03c41 can be right split at b2 to a complete train track\n\u03c4 \u2032 , and we can find that \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 A1 . Incidentally, if we left split \u03c41 at b2 ,\nwe cannot get a complete train track (see Figure 11). In the same way,\nwe can get \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 \u2208 A1 by being left splits \u03c4 at both b1 and b2 . That is to\nsay, we can get two complete train tracks \u03c4 \u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032\u2032 \u2208 A1 by splits at both\nb1 and b2 of \u03c4 .\n\nFigure 11.\nWe construct graph T1 as follow: V (T1 ) is A1 . We connect \u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 A\nby an edge if \u03c4 \u2032 can be obtained by splits at two larges edges of \u03c4 .\nClearly, T1 is homeomorphic to subgraph of T T (S0,4 ).\nLemma 6.2. T1 is connected and is quasi-isometric to the dual of F .\n\n\f14\n\nKEITA IBARAKI\n\nProof. Let \u03c4 \u2208 V (T1 ). \u03c4 has two vertex cycles connected by an edge in\nF . Thus, we can think it just the same as T T (S1,1 ). As a result, we\ncan get this Lemma.\n\u0003\nLemma 6.3. Let \u03c4 be any complete train track of S0,4 . Then there is\n\u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 V (T1 ) obtained from \u03c4 by at most 5 splits.\nProof. We can easily see that each C 1 \u2013diffeomorphism class of V (T T (S0,4 ))\nhas a train track \u03c4 which implements d(\u03c4, V (T1 )) \u2264 5 (see Figure 12).\nMeanwhile, d(\u03c4, V (T1 )) depends only on a C 1 \u2013diffeomorphism class\nof \u03c4 , because the mapping class group M(S0,4 ) acts isometrically on\nT T (S1,1 ). Now this Lemma is proved.\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition 6.1. We obtained this theorem by Lemma 6.2 and\n6.3.\n\u0003\nSimilar to the construction of \u03c6 in Section 5, we construct the map\n\u03c8 : V (T T (S0,4 )) \u2192 E(F ) as follow : Let \u03c4 \u2208 V (T T (S1,1 )). Suppose\nc1 , c2 are vertex cycles on \u03c4 . If i(c1 , c2 ) = 2, there is an edge e which\nconnects c1 and c2 in F . We define \u03c8(\u03c4 ) as e. If i(c1 , c2 ) = 4, there\nare two simple closed curves c3 , c4 that implement i(cj , ck ) = 2 (j =\n1, 2, k = 3, 4), i(c3 , c4 ) = 2. We define \u03c8(\u03c4 ) as the edge which connects\nc3 and c4 . We construct graph G2 as the same as G1 of Section 5 and\nextends to \u03c8 : T T (S0,4 ) \u2192 G2 .\nLemma 6.4. G2 is quasi-isometric to the dual of the Farey graph.\nProof. It is possible to think this just as G1 .\nLet \u03c4 \u2208 V (T T (S0,4 )) and \u03c4 \u2032 obtained by a single split of \u03c4 . The\nrelation between vertex cycles on \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 can fall into the following 3\ntypes (see also Table 1):\n(i) \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 have the same vertex cycles. Thus \u03c6(\u03c4 ) and \u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032 ) are\nthe same edge in F .\n(ii) One vertex cycle c1 on \u03c4 and c\u20321 on \u03c4 \u2032 are the same. Another\nvertex cycles c2 on \u03c4 and c\u20322 on \u03c4 \u2032 intersect at 2 points. Thus\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) and \u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032 ) are an adjacent edge in F .\n(iii) One vertex cycle c1 on \u03c4 and c\u20321 on \u03c4 \u2032 are the same. Another\nvertex cycles c2 on \u03c4 and c\u20322 on \u03c4 \u2032 intersect at 4 points. Thus\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) and \u03c6(\u03c4 \u2032 ) are the next but one edge in F .\nSo, the edges of G2 connect adjacent or next but one edges in F .\nThus, G2 is quasi-isometric to G1 and the dual of F .\n\u0003\nWe note that G2 is isomorphic to Figure 13.\nLemma 6.5. \u03c8 : T T (S0,4 ) \u2192 G2 is a quasi-isometry.\nProof.

Since\nM(S0,4 ) acts isometrically on T T (S1,1 ) and acts transitively on V (G2 ),\na := diam(\u03c8 \u22121 (e)) is constant for all e.

Action of the mapping class group\nIt is well known that M(S1,1 ) is isomorphic to SL(2, Z) (see for\ninstance [Tak01]). Also M(S0,4 ) has a subgroup of finite index which\nis isomorphic P SL(2, Z).\nFirst, we prove Collolary1.3 and 1.4\nProof of Collolary1.3. Let \u03c4 be a complete train track on the oncepunctured torus S1,1 . The train track complex is locally finite. The\nstabilizer stab(\u03c4 ) under the action of M(S1,1 ) is finite. Thus, {\u03c3 \u2208\nM(S1,1 ) | d(\u03c4, \u03c3\u03c4 ) \u2264 r} is finite for all r \u2265 0. It follows that the action\nof M(S1,1 ) on T T (S1,1 ) is properly discontinuous.\nM(S1,1) acts transitively on V (T T (S1,1 )), since all complete train\ntracks on S1,1 are C 1 \u2013diffeomorphism. It follows that the orbit M(S1,1 )\u03c4 =\nV (T T (S1,1 )) and thus N(M(S1,1 )\u03c4, 1) = T T (S1,1 ). That is to say, any\norbit M(S1,1 )\u03c4 is cobounded. By Proposition 2.1, the action of M(S1,1 )\non T T (S1,1 ) is cocompact.\nLet \u03c4 be a complete train track on the 4-punctured sphere S0,4 . Just\nas in the case of M(S1,1 ), the action of M(S0,4 ) on T T (S0,4 ) is properly\ndiscontinuous.\nM(S0,4) acts transitively on V (T1 ). Thus the orbit M(S0,4 )\u03c4 of\n\u03c4 \u2208 V (T1 ) is V (T1 ). By Lemma 6.3, N(M(V (T1 ), 6) = T T (S0,4 ). So,\nsome orbit is cobounded. By Proposition 2.1, the action of M(S0,4 ) on\nT T (S0,4 ) is cocompact.\n\u0003\nProof of Collolary1.4. The train track complex T T (S) is a locally finite\ngraph. Thus T T (S) is a proper space. Since the mapping class group\nM(S) is finitely generated, by Theorem 2.3 and Corollary 1.3, T T (S1,1 )\nis quasi-isometric to M(S).\n\u0003\nAs already stated in Section 5, T T (S1,1 ) is isomorphic to the Caley\ngraph of P SL(2, Z). Similarly, we can notice that T1 in Section 6\nis isomorphic to T T (S1,1 ) and hence the Cayley graph of P SL(2, Z).\nThus, P SL(2, Z) acts freely and p.d.c. on T1 and on V (T1 ) transitively.\nMeanwhile, we can easily show that M(S0,4 ) acts p.d.c. on T1 and the\nstabilizer stab(\u03c4 ) for \u03c4 \u2208 T1 is isomorphic to dihedral group Z/2Z \u00d7\nZ/2Z. Hence index of P SL(2, Z) on M(S0,4 ) equals 4.\nReferences\n[APS06] Javier Aramayona, Hugo Parlier, and Kenneth J.
