Since its\ndiscovery in 1974 (Balick & Brown 1974), Sgr A* has been observed extensively with radio\ntelescopes in the northern hemisphere, and temporal flux variations at millimeter wavelengths\nwere reported. With VLA observations, Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2006b) detected an increase of\nflux density at a fractional level of 7% and 4.5% at 7- and 13-mm, respectively, with a\nduration of about 2 hr. The peak flare emission at 7-mm led the 13-mm peak flare by 20-40\nminutes. Mauerhan et al. (2005) detected intra-day variations (IDVs) of about 20% and in\nsome cases up to 40% at 3-mm using the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO). The\nrise and decay occurred on a timescale of 1-2 hr. At 2-mm, Miyazaki et al. (2004) reported\na 30% flux increase in 30 minutes from the monitoring of the Nobeyama Millimeter Array\n(NMA). On the other hand, flares with violent intensity increases in very short timescales\nhave also been detected at infrared and X-ray bands (Genzel et al. 2003; Baganoff et al.\n2001; Eckart et al. 2006b), inferring that these emissions from Sgr A* originate within very\nvicinity of the central massive black hole. This is further strengthened by the simultaneous\ndetection of X-ray, infrared and sub-mm flares (Eckart et al. 2004, 2006a, 2008a, 2008b;\nYusef-Zadeh et al. 2006a, 2008; Marrone et al. 2008).\nSince Sgr A* is embedded in thick thermal material, it is particularly difficult to observe\nits intrinsic structure. But observations of IDV can give indirect constraints on the source\nemission geometry and emission mechanisms. However, previous monitoring observations of\nSgr A* from the northern hemisphere have been strictly limited to a short observing window\n(< 7 hr/day) for the Galactic Center region. We have performed monitoring observations of\nflux density toward Sgr A* at 3-mm since 2005 October when for the first time the Australia\nTelescope Compact Array (ATCA) of the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) was\navailable at 3-mm. The ATCA is an interferometer consisting of five 22-m radio telescopes at\nNarrabri, Australia where Sgr A* passes almost overhead, allowing a much longer observing\nwindow (> 8 hr at elevation angles above 40\u25e6 ). As such, the ATCA calibrations and flux\ndensity measurements of Sgr A* are expected to be more accurate.\nIn this paper, we report our effort to search for IDV in Sgr A* with the ATCA. We first\nintroduce the ATCA observations in \u00a7 2. The data reduction and analysis with emphasis\non the gain calibrations are described in detail in \u00a7 3. In \u00a7 4, we present the detection of\nIDV events in Sgr A*. To interpret the observation, we discuss two possible scenarios in \u00a7 5,\nfollowed by a summary in \u00a7 6. Throughout this paper, the fractional variation is defined as\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nSmax \u2212Smin\n1\n(Smax +Smin )\n2\n\n, here Smax and Smin refer to the maximum and minimum value of flux density,\nrespectively.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, we performed 3-mm ATCA flux density monitoring of Sgr A* over 50\nhr in the following 3 sessions: 2005 October 18, 2006 June 9 and August 9-13. Dual (linear)\npolarization double sideband (DSB) HEMT receivers were used. The first ever 3-mm ATCA\nmonitoring of Sgr A* was performed on 2005 October 18 when the data were simultaneously\nrecorded, in both the lower (93.504 GHz) and upper (95.552 GHz) sidebands, in 32 channels\nof a total bandwidth of 128 MHz. For the observations in 2006, the data were recorded in\ntwo slightly different 3-mm bands: the lower sideband (86.243 GHz) was set to the transition\nfrequency of the SiO J=2-1 v=1 line with 256 channels of a total bandwidth of 16 MHz,\nthe upper sideband (88.896 GHz) was a wideband with 32 channels of a total bandwidth\nof 128 MHz. Since the continuum data of the lower sideband with narrow bandwidth have\nrelatively low signal to noise ratio, only the upper sideband data were used for Sgr A* and\nother continuum sources.\nOn 2005 October 18, we observed Sgr A* in the H168C configuration of the ATCA, with\na maximum baseline of 192 m, uv range of 13 - 61k\u03bb and a synthesized beam of 2.\u2032\u2032 9\u00d71.\u2032\u2032 7. On\n2006 June 9, the observations were performed in the 1.5D configuration with a maximum\nbaseline of 1439 m, covering uv range of 20 - 430k\u03bb and yielding a synthesized beam of\n2.\u2032\u2032 1 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 3. In 2006 August, the observations were performed in SPLIT5 configuration with\na maximum baseline of 1929 m, covering uv range of 3 - 570k\u03bb and yielding a synthesized\nbeam of 1.\u2032\u2032 3 \u00d7 0.\u2032\u2032 2. In this array, the spacing between antennas 2 and 3 and antennas 3 and\n4 are only 31 m, causing severe shadow effect, especially for antenna 3.\nQuasar 3C 279 was observed for 10 minutes at the beginning of the observation to\ncalibrate bandpass. Either a planet or a bright radio source was observed for the flux\ndensity calibration. The first 3-mm ATCA observation of Sgr A* lasted for 10 hr on 2005\nOctober 18. It alternated between Sgr A* and the only secondary calibrator PKS 1730-130,\nwhich was also used as pointing calibrator. The primary calibrator Uranus was observed for\n10 minutes at the end of the observation. In 2006 June and August, we observed Sgr A*\nin a total of 6 days with a thoughtful calibration strategy. Up to four secondary calibrators\n(control sources) including an SiO maser source (OH2.6-0.4) and three continuum sources\n(PKS 1921-293, PKS 1710-269 and PKS 1730-130) were observed to check the consistency\nof the gain calibrations. Limited by the weather, ATCA observed Sgr A* for only 1 hr\non August 9, 4 hr on August 10 and 2 hr on August 11. Therefore, we will focus on the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nmeasurements on June 9, August 12 and 13. The pointing accuracy was checked every half\nan hour by observing VX Sgr, a known strong SiO maser source. The instrumental gain and\nphase were calibrated by alternating observations of Sgr A* and all secondary calibrators.\nIn 2006 June, the observations were performed using the following sequence: OH2.6-0.4 (2\nmin), Sgr A* (5 min), PKS 1730-130 (2 min), and PKS 1921-293 (1 min). In 2006 August,\nthe observing sequence was PKS 1710-269 (2 min), OH2.6-0.4 (1 min), Sgr A* (10 min),\nPKS 1710-269 (2 min), OH2.6-0.4 (1 min), PKS 1730-130 (1 min), and PKS 1921-293 (1\nmin). The observing details have been summarized in Table 1.\n\n3.\n\nDATA REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS\n\nAll the data processing was conducted using the ATNF MIRIAD package (Sault et\nal. 1995). At millimeter wavelengths, the atmosphere can no longer be approximately\ntransparent. The opacity effect is included in an effective system temperature - the so-called\n\"above atmosphere\" system temperature (Ulich 1980) for the ATCA measurements at 3mm. The bandpass corrections were made using the strong ATCA calibrator 3C279. For\namplitude calibration, we first applied a nominal elevation-dependent gains of the antennas\nand then used calibrators to further determine the additional corrections. On 2005 October\n18, the flux scale was based on observation of Uranus. On 2006 June 9, the flux density scale\nwas determined using PKS 1730-130, assuming its flux density of 2.27 Jy at 3-mm. In 2006\nAugust, we derived the flux density scale with another brighter radio source PKS 1921-293,\nwhich is reported to be 8.44 Jy during our observations from the ATCA calibrator list on web.\nFrom the ATCA calibrator flux density monitoring data during 2003 to 2006, we estimated\nits mean flux density of 8.66 Jy with a standard deviation of 1.04, implying a dispersion of\nabout 12%. PKS 1921-293 is probably better than that of other calibrators simply because\nPKS 1921-293 data usually have very high signal-to-noise ratio. So, we expect an accuracy\n\u2264 20% for the absolute amplitude calibration in these observations. After the phase selfcalibration, the data were averaged in 5 minutes bin to search for shorter timescale variability.\nThe flux density of Sgr A* was estimated by fitting a point source model to visibilities on the\nprojected baselines longer than 25k\u03bb (about 85 m at 3-mm) to suppress the contamination\nfrom the surrounding extended components (Miyazaki et al. 2004; Mauerhan et al. 2005).\nBoth the fitting error reported by MIRIAD and the rms of the residual visibilities were used\nto get the final error estimate.\nIn order to establish strong cases for variability of Sgr A* at millimeter wavelengths, reliable calibrations of both elevation- and time-dependent gains are crucial. We have carefully\nconsidered and corrected the following factors that could affect the measurements during the\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ncalibration process.\n1. Antenna gain varies with elevation angle mainly because of the gravitational distortion of the dish. The antenna efficiency of ATCA has maximum value at an elevation angle\nof 60\u25e6 and minimum value at an elevation angle of 90\u25e6 . A nominal gain-elevation correction in MIRIAD is applied at elevations greater than 40\u25e6 for 3-mm observations, only those\ndata observed at elevation angles above 40\u25e6 were used. However, such nominal elevationdependent gains built in MIRIAD seem hard to fully compensate the gain variation. We\nhave plotted flux density as a function of elevation angle and found that a nearby calibrator was needed to make further correction, otherwise significant elevation effect (e.g., peaks\nat about 60\u25e6 , or reaches the lowest point at 90\u25e6 elevation angle) will be shown up in the\nlight-curve, which often indicates some calibration errors. PKS 1730-130, which is often\nused to calibrate phase and amplitude during observations from northern hemisphere at mm\nwavelength (e.g. Miyazaki et al. 2004, Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2008), is proved to be unsuitable\nfor the ATCA observations. It is 16.2\u25e6 away from Sgr A*, and its elevation angle is only\n72\u25e6 when Sgr A* reaches the zenith. Thus, gain corrections derived from this source data\ncannot fully compensate the elevation effect in Sgr A*, especially for observations at high\nelevations. Similarly, PKS 1921-293, which reaches the zenith 2 hr later than Sgr A*, is not\nsuitable, either. So we only use two closer sources PKS 1741-312 and OH2.6-0.4 for the gain\ncalibration.\n2. Calibrators are, in general, variable sources which will unavoidably introduce uncertainties into the nominal time-independent gains. For this reason, several secondary\ncalibrators were actually scheduled to check the consistency. The complex gains derived\nfrom one control source were applied to both Sgr A* and other control sources. If such a\ncontrol source is strongly variable, a somehow similar trend in light-curve will appear for all\nthe other sources (including Sgr A*) after calibration.\nTo check the significance of any detected variability, we introduced the modulation index,\nwhich is defined as the rms of the gain correction of five antennas derived from calibrators\nand flux density of Sgr A* divided by their mean, corresponding to the degree of variation\nfor Sgr A*, and the fractional uncertainty in time-dependent gain correction, respectively.\nObviously, if the modulation index of Sgr A* flux density is much larger than that of antenna\ngain correction, the detected flux variation is most likely to be real. The modulation indices\nof Sgr A* and gain correction of five antennas derived from two nearby calibrators OH2.60.4 and PKS 1710-269 on 2006 June 9, August 12 and 13 are plotted in Figure 1. The\nmodulation indices of Sgr A* were quite large on 2006 August 12 and 13, indicating the real\ndetection of IDV from Sgr A*. As mentioned in \u00a7 2, many data obtained from antenna 3\nin 2006 August were shadowed and thus not used in obtaining its gain correction, resulting\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nin a large fluctuation in its gain correction and thus a bigger modulation index. During\nobservations in 2006 August, the 3-mm flux density of PKS 1710-269 is around 0.5 Jy, only\none fiftieth of that of OH2.6-0.4, therefore the signal-to-noise ratio of PKS 1710-269 data\nis much lower than that of OH2.6-0.4. This explains why the modulation indices of gain\ncorrections derived from PKS 1710-269 are relatively high.\n3. As mentioned in \u00a7 2, we only used upper sideband (88.896 GHz) data with a bandwidth of 128 MHz for Sgr A* and other continuum control sources, and the lower sideband\n(86.243 GHz) data of 32 MHz bandwidth only for the SiO maser source OH2.6-0.4. Will\nthere be an additional uncertainty when applying to Sgr A* the gain solutions derived from\nOH2.6-0.4 data? We inspect this by comparing the results of the two sidebands on 2006\nAugust 12 and 13. Similar to what we did for the upper sideband data, the flux densities of\nSgr A* was also estimated from the lower sideband using the same channels as OH2.6-0.4.\nThe results from the lower sideband data show larger error bars mainly because of the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio. The average deviations from results of upper sideband data\nare 2.4% on August 12 and 3.6% on August 13, much smaller than the fractional variation\nof Sgr A* (see \u00a7 4).\n4. We also consider the response of feeds to polarized emission. The feed of ATCA is\nlinearly polarized, and its response to a signal is a combination of total and linear polarized\nintensity. Thus, two polarization products, XX and YY correlations can be used as a direct\nmeasure of total intensity only when a calibrator is not linearly polarized. Unfortunately,\npolarizations of nearly 27% were observed in OH2.6-0.4 (Glenn et al. 2003). In addition,\nfor ATCA antennas on altazimuth mounts, their feeds rotate with respect to the equatorial\nframe. This causes the actual response of ideal linearly polarized feeds to vary with the\nparallactic angle. To solve this problem, we used total intensity by summing the two polarization products (XX and YY) to remove the effect of linear polarization of the SiO maser\nOH2.6-0.4, and then derived the gain correction. In other words, a single joint solution\nwas determined. This is generally a reasonable approximation given that antenna gains are\ndominated by changes common to both polarizations and, the difference between them is\nonly a few percent and can be ignored safely (Maxim Voronkov, private communication).\nOverall, OH2.6-0.4, which is relatively stable and close to Sgr A* (about 2.7\u25e6 away),\nproved to be the best control source. As such, it was used as the main secondary calibrator\nto determine the antenna gain corrections for all the results presented in this paper.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n4.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDuring the first 3-mm ATCA observation of Sgr A* on 2005 October 18, the flux density\nof Sgr A* ran up to 3.5 Jy, much brighter than the normally expected 1.5 Jy in the quiescent\nphase, and thus Sgr A* was very likely to be in an active phase during our observation.\nAlthough Sgr A* seems to vary in its total flux density as a function of time, we can not\nrule out the possibility of the elevation-dependent gain effect as use of the only secondary\ncalibrator PKS 1730-130 (16.2\u25e6 from Sgr A*) severely limited the amplitude calibration.\nBecause of this, starting from observations in 2006 June and August (see \u00a7 2), we paid a\nparticular attention to the strategy of calibration. As a result, the light-curves of Sgr A* at\n3-mm in 2006 are reliably obtained (Figure 2). All the data were calibrated using OH2.6-0.4.\nThe flux densities were estimated by fitting a point source model to visibility data on the\nprojected baselines longer than 25k\u03bb. Following is a detailed description of the results from\neach observation.\nThe flux density of Sgr A* was relatively high (around 3 Jy) but stable on 2006 June\n9. As shown in Figure 1, the modulation index of Sgr A* is small and comparable to that\nof antenna gains. Therefore, no IDV was detected.\nDuring the first three days in the 2006 August session (August 9, 10 and 11), very\nlimited data were available. The flux density of Sgr A* was decreased from 2.52 to 2.25 Jy\nin 1 hr on August 9, stayed around 1.9 Jy quite stably during the 4 hr run on August 10 and\naround 2.0 Jy over the 2 hr observation on August 11. So, we conclude that no ascertained\nIDV was detected.\nTwo clear IDV events were seen in the last two days of the 2006 August session. As\nshown in the light-curves of Sgr A* and other sources on 2006 August 12 (Figure 3 left), first\nthe flux density of Sgr A* decreased from 1.65 to 1.50 Jy, and then increased to 2.11 Jy in\n2.5 hr before decreasing again to 1.90 Jy. The fractional flux density variation is estimated\nto be 33%. On 2006 August 13 (Figure 3 right), the flux density of Sgr A* first increased\nfrom 1.95 to 2.14 Jy, reached its first peak before decreasing to 1.80 Jy in 1.7 hr. Then it\nreached the second peak 2.22 Jy in 1.9 hr, and declined to 1.98 Jy in 1.2 hr. The maximum\nfractional flux density variation is 21% with a timescale of about 2 hr. As shown in Figure\n1, the modulation indices of Sgr A* on both August 12 and 13 are much greater than that\nof gain corrections, supporting that the observed flux density variations are most likely to\nbe real.\nThe NMA observations of Sgr A* from 1996 to 2003 indicate that Sgr A* has quiescent\nand active phases, the peaks of flares were 2-3 Jy at 3-mm while the mean flux density\nin a quiescent phase was 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 Jy at 90 GHz (Tsutsumi et al. 2002, Miyazaki et\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nal. 2003), which are in accord with our ATCA observations. As is shown in Figure 2,\nthe mean flux density of Sgr A* dropped from 2.97 to 2.16 Jy from 2006 June to August\nsession. The day-to-day fractional variation of Sgr A* appeared to be low from 2006 August\n10 to 13. Comparison of flux densities in two observing sessions in 2006 indicates that\nSgr A* appeared to undergo a high state in 2006 June session, and a low state in 2006\nAugust session. Such different states were also noted by Herrnstein et al. (2004). They\nfound a bimodal distribution of flux densities at centimeter wavelength and thought that it\nmight indicate the existence of two distinct states of accretion onto the supermassive black\nhole. Different radiation states usually have connections to certain physical parameters or\nradiation model. For example, a unified inner advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF)\nmodel with different accretion rates and consequently different geometries of accretion flow\nhas been proposed to explain five distinct spectral states that have been identified in black\nhole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), namely the quiescent, low, intermediate, high and very high\nstates (Esin et al. 1997). Supposing that the accretion model of Sgr A* has something in\ncommon with that of BHXBs, the accretion rate in 2006 August session should be smaller\nthan that in June session, but the accretion rate may not change much over days in August.\n\n5.\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\nSeveral models have been invoked to explain the flaring activity of Sgr A*, such as the\nexpanding plasmon model and orbiting hot spot model. We will discuss them separately.\n\n5.1.\n\nThe Plasmon Model\n\nExpanding plasmon model of van der Laan (1966) was invoked to explain observed time\ndelay in variation of Sgr A* at 7- and 13-mm (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2006a, 2006b, 2008).\nIn this model, rather than the synchrotron cooling, the adiabatic cooling associated with\nexpansion of the emitting plasma is responsible for the decline of flare. Flaring at a given\nfrequency is produced through the adiabatic expansion of an initially optically thick blob of\nsynchrotron-emitting relativistic electrons. The initial rise of the flux density is produced\nby the increase in the surface area of blob while it still remains optically thick; the curve\nturns over once the blob becomes optically thin because of the reduction in the magnetic\nfield, the adiabatic cooling of electrons, and the reduced column density as the blob expands.\nSuch kind of blob ejected from an ADAF is also thought to be a possible explanation for\nnonthermal flares and recombination X-ray lines in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and\nradio-loud quasars (Wang et al. 2000).\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nOur observed IDVs with different amplitudes and timescales seem consistent with the\nexpanding plasmon model in the context of jet or outflow. The amplitudes and timescales\nvary with the relativistic particle energy distribution, expanding velocity and size of the\nblob. To apply the model to the light-curves on 2006 August 12 and 13, we first assumed a\npower-law spectrum of the relativistic particle energy (n(E) \u221d E \u2212p ). Hornstein et al. (2007)\nreported a constant spectral index of 0.6 using multi-band IR observations of several flares.\nHere we adopt a spectral index of 0.6, corresponding to the particle spectral index of 2.2, the\nenergy of the particles was assumed to range from 10 MeV to 3 GeV. The expanding velocity\nwas supposed to be constant. As is stated by Yusef-Zadeh (2008), the relationship between\nthe quiescent and flaring states of Sgr A* is not fully understood. Their results indicate that\nthe quiescent emission at 7- and 13-mm varies on different days. The minimum flux density\nwas 1.5 Jy during our 2006 August observing session, the quiescent flux density, if it does\nexist, should not be more than this value. We then assume a quiescent flux density of 1.4\nJy, while the flare is produced by the blob. Other parameters were derived by means of the\nweighted least square method. We adopt exponentially increasing step length for number\ndensity during the fitting in order to improve efficiency. The uncertainties of the parameters\nwere assessed by scaling up the 68.3 % confidence region of parameter space, as an increase\nof \u03c72 from \u03c72min to \u03c72min + \u03c72\u03bd with the reduced chi squares, \u03c72\u03bd = \u03c72min /Ndof , where Ndof is\nthe difference between the number of data and the number of fitting parameters (c.f. Shen\net al. 2003).\nWe used two blobs to fit for flare observed on 2006 August 12 and three blobs for those\nobserved on 2006 August 13. Initial magnetic field of 20-50 Gauss were derived from the fit.\nThe electron cooling timescale due to synchrotron loss is (e.g., Marrone et al. 2008)\n\u0010 \u03bd \u0011\u22121/2 \u0012 B \u0013\u22123/2\ntsyn = 38\n[hr].\n(1)\n90\n10\n\nwhere the frequency (\u03bd) is in GHz and magnetic field (B) in Gauss. It is about 3.4 hr with\na magnetic field of 50 Gauss at 90 GHz, which is comparable to the observed decreasing\ntimescale of 2 hr. Thus the synchrotron cooling of the electrons should not be ignored. We\ntook this into account and re-did the whole fit. The energy loss rate is given by You (1998):\n(\n2\n\nd\u03b3\n)syn = \u22123 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u03b3 2 Umag ,\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Umag = B8\u03c0 . With a constant expanding velocity v, the radius of the blob R can be\nexpressed as R = R0 + vt, R0 is the initial radius of the blob at a specific instant t0 = 0.\nSubstituting B and t with v, R, R0 and the initial magnetic field B0 , Eq.(2) can be written\nas\n1 d\u03b3\n3 \u00d7 10\u22128 B02 R04 2 \u22124\nd\u03b3\n\u03b3 R = \u2212c1 \u03b3 2 R\u22124\n(3)\n( )syn = ( )syn = \u2212\ndR\nv dt\n8\u03c0v\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nwhere c1 =\n\n3\u00d710\u22128 B02 R40\n.\n8\u03c0v\n\nThe energy loss rate due to the adiabatical expanding is\n(\n\nd\u03b3\n\u03b3\n)exp = \u2212 .\ndR\nR\n\n(4)\n\nThus the total energy loss rate due to both synchrotron cooling and expanding is\n\u03b3\nd\u03b3\n= \u2212 \u2212 c1 \u03b3 2 R\u22124\ndR\nR\n\n(5)\n\nEq.

Since c1 \u03b30 R0\u22123 (p \u2212 1) \u221d B02 , B0 is the\nmost sensitive parameter for the evolution of flux S(\u03bd, R). To illustrate this, we choose\ntypical values of p = 2.2, \u03b30 = 20, R0 = 4rg and v = 0.004c and show the resulting model\nlight curves at 90 GHz while B0 is 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 Gauss in Figure 4. Results from\nexpanding plasmon model of van der Laan (1966) are shown in dotted lines, and results from\nexpanding plasmon model with synchrotron cooling are shown in solid lines. The differences\nbetween two results are significant above 30 Gauss, implying that the synchrotron cooling\nof electrons should not be ignored for strong magnetic field.\nThe best-fit model for the light-curve of 2006 August 12 is plotted as a solid line in\nFigure 5 left. Two blobs were required to fit the data, which were assumed to appear at\n7.0 and 10.3 UT. We attribute the turnover in light curve to the birth of a new blob, so\nthe second blob was assumed to appear before the flux increases.

The uncertainty that was failed to be assessed was left\nblank, if not such a sensitive parameter. The peak flux densities of two blobs are estimated to\nbe 0.26 and 0.59 Jy, respectively. The half-power durations are 1.7 and 5.2 hr, respectively.\nBlob mass of 2.3 \u00d7 1020 g and 1.4 \u00d7 1021 g were estimated.\nFigure 5 right shows the best-fit model for the light-curve of 2006 August 13.

The peak flux densities of three blobs are 0.67, 0.66 and 0.48 Jy, respectively. The halfpower durations are 3.2, 2.8 and 2.4 hr, respectively. Blob mass of 1.8\u00d71020 g, 8.5\u00d71020 g and\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n9.4 \u00d7 1020 g were estimated based on derived parameters. The mass-loss rate contributed by\nblob was then calculated to be 9.7\u00d710\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . This value is lower than the accretion rate\nrange 2 \u00d710\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 to 2 \u00d710\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 estimated by the rotation measure measurements\n(Marrone et al. 2007). The derived parameters have been summarized in Table 2.\nIn principle, the expanding plasmon model can also be used to interpret the 2000 March\n7 NMA short millimeter flare reported by Miyazaki et al. (2004). In their observation, the\npeak flux density at the 140 GHz band is apparently larger than that at the 100 GHz band.\nThe spectral variation suggests that the energy injection to photons occurred in the higher\nfrequency regime first and the emitting frequency was shifted to the millimeter-wavelength\nregime with time, which is well consistent with the scenario predicted by expanding plasmon\nmodel. A time delay of 1.5 hr was observed for NIR and sub-mm flare on 2008 June 3\n(Eckart et al. 2008b), which has been explained with a similar model with adiabatically\nexpanding source components. There, the spectral index (0.9 to 1.8), expansion velocity\n(0.005c) and source size (\u223c2 rg ) are fairly consistent with the parameters derived here. In\norder to compare with their modeling results, we calculate the optical depth at sub-mm\nbased on parameters derived here. Take the first blob of 2006 Aug 13 for example, according\nto Pacholczyk (1970), the optical depth at 90 GHz is calculated to be 8.23 at t0 . The critical\noptical depth at which the flux density for any particular frequency peaks at t0 , is calculated\nto be 1.82 based on Eq.(12). According to Eq.(7), the optical depth at 345 GHz is 0.14,\nwhich is smaller than the critical value. Therefore, at both NIR and sub-mm wavelengths,\nthe emission is optically thin at the beginning. Since we attribute the turnover in light\ncurve to the emergence of a new blob, so the new blob is assumed to appear right before\nthe observed flux density increases. Extending the model in time might help give time delay\nbetween NIR and sub-mm, however, the birth time of blob is difficult to determine. Future\nsimultaneous multi-wavelength observation, especially the correlation between optically thin\n(such as NIR/X-ray) and 3-mm flaring emission is expected to help improve the model fitting.\n\n5.2.\n\nThe Hot Spot Model\n\nAn orbiting hot spot model has been frequently used to mainly explain the observations\nof short-term NIR and X-ray variability (Broderick & Loeb 2005, 2006, Meyer et al. 2006a,\n2006b, Trippe et al. 2007, Eckart et al. 2006b, 2008a). The hot spot is modeled by an\noverdensity of non-thermal electrons centred at a certain point of its Keplerian orbit. This\nsituation may arise in the case of magnetic reconnection event similar to the solar flare.\nDue to the Doppler shift and relativistic beaming the approaching portion of the hot spot\norbit appears considerably brighter than the receding portion. This model is successful in\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nexplaining the NIR 17 minutes quasi-periodic oscillation (Genzel et al. 2003). The hot\nspot model is applied to radio band by including the effects of disk opacity for a typical\nRIAF model (Broderick & Loeb 2006). In these studies, the hot spot is always close to the\ninnermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), thus the NIR 17 minutes quasi-periodic oscillation\ncan be produced. Since the creation of such a hot spot is still under discussion, it is also\npossible that such kind of spot may appear somewhere away from the ISCO and thus produce\nquasi-periodic oscillation with a longer timescale.\nIn the accretion disk, neighboring annuli of differentially rotating matter experience\na viscous shear that transports angular momentum outwards and allows matter to slowly\nspiral in towards the center of the potential (Merloni 2002). As a result, the gas rotates\nwith a sub-Keplerian angular velocity (Narayan et al. 1997). In the following we assume\nthat the rotation of hot spot is also sub-Keplerian and fit our detected IDV events using a\nsub-Keplerian rotating hot spot model. To simplify the calculation, the angular velocity is\nassumed to be 0.4 times of Keplerian angular velocity of a Schwarzschild black hole.\nWe assumed the values of most physical parameters of the hot spot model the same as\nthose in the expanding plasmon model when starting fitting the hot spot model to lightcurves. These include: the energy range of relativistic particles, the particle spectral index\nand the quiescent flux density. Then we estimated other parameters by means of weighted\nleast square method. The magnetic field was assumed to range from 1 to 100 Gauss. In RIAF\nmodel, the electron number density of accretion disk is about 2 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 at a distance\n20rg from the central black hole (Yuan et al. 2003). Since the hot spot is modeled by an\noverdensity of non-thermal electrons, it is safe to assume the electron number density ranges\nfrom 4 \u00d7 106 to 1 \u00d7 108 cm\u22123 . In addition, the accretion disk is assumed to be edge-on to\nmaximize the boosting effect (Huang et al. 2007; 2008). The final result is the combination\nof the quiescent flux density and flux density of hot spot. The derived parameters are\nsummarized in Table 3.\nThe hot spot model for the 2006 August 12 flaring is plotted as a solid line in Figure\n6 left. The quiescent flux density was assumed to be 1.4 Jy. Two hot spots are needed to\nfit the data. Radius of 6.5 \u00b1 0.5rg and 8.0 \u00b1 0.5rg , magnetic intensity of 3+2 and 1+2 Gauss\nand electron number density of 4+26 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 and 4+26 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 were derived from the\nweighted least square fitting. The separation to central black hole is 10 \u00b1 1rg and 12+2\n\u22121 rg .\nThe hot spot model for the light-curve of 2006 August 13 is plotted as a solid line in\nFigure 6 right. The quiescent flux density was 1.4 Jy too. One hot spot is required to fit the\ndata. Radius of 4.1 \u00b1 0.3rg , magnetic intensity of 6+2\n\u22125 Gauss and electron number density of\n+44\n6\n\u22123\n6\n\u00d7 10 cm were derived. The hot spot is at 11.4+0.4\n\u22120.2 rg from the central black hole.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nThe electron cooling timescales due to synchrotron losses are calculated to be greater\nthan 2 days at 90 GHz, much longer than the observed variation timescale, thus the synchrotron energy loss can be ignored in the fitting. Since the synchrotron cooling time is\nlong, the life time of hot spot should mainly depend on the dynamical timescale. Reid et al.\n(2008) analyzed the limits on the position wander of Sgr A*, ruling out the possibility of hot\nspots with orbital radius above 15rg that contribute more than 30% of the total 7-mm flux.\nAll the orbital radius listed in Table 3 are smaller than 15rg . Hence, the presented hotspot\nmodel is not in contradiction with their result.\nThe discussion above shows that both the expanding plasmon model and the orbiting\nhot spot model can be used to interpret the detected two IDV events. Given that the\nformer model predicts a time delay in flare emission, while the latter does not, the time\ndelay between different frequencies in flare emission is believed to be critical to distinguish\nbetween them (Yusef-zadeh et al. 2006b). Recently, Yusef-zadeh et al. (2008) detected time\nlags of 20.4\u00b16.8, 30\u00b112 and 20\u00b16 minutes between the flare peaks observed at 13-mm and\n7-mm. At shorter wavelength, a possible time delay of 110\u00b117 minutes between X-rays and\n850-\u03bcm was observed (Marrone et al. 2008). Though these observations seem to support\nthe expanding plasmon model, the hot spot model is still a possible explanation, especially\nfor the observed nearly symmetrical light-curves.\n\n6.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe presented the results of the ATCA flux density monitoring of Sgr A* at 3-mm, with\nemphasis on the detected two IDV events. Comparison of flux densities in two observing\nsessions in 2006 indicates that Sgr A* appeared to undergo a high state in June session,\nand a low state in August session. On 2006 August 12, Sgr A* exhibits a 33% fractional\nvariation in about 2.5 hr. Two peaks with a separation of 4 hr are seen on 2006 August 13\nflare which exhibits a maximum variation of 21% within 2 hr.\nThe short timescales inspire us to consider mechanisms other than synchrotron cooling\nthat may be responsible for the variation. Both the expanding plasmon model and the\nsub-Keplerian rotating hot spot model were discussed and applied to interpret the observed\nlight curves. Because of a relatively large derived magnetic intensity (and thus a short\nsynchrotron cooling timescale), we incorporated the synchrotron cooling into the original\nadiabatically expanding plasmon model to model the observed IDV data. The radius of blob\nwas estimated to range from 1 to 5rg , the expanding velocity range from 0.001c to 0.007c,\nthe electron number density larger than 1 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 and the magnetic field range from\n7 to 30 Gauss. A minimum mass-loss rate of 9.7 \u00d7 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 was deduced based on\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nthese derived parameters. We assume that the rotation of hot spot is sub-Keplerian while\napplying the hotspot model. It seems that both models can reasonably fit the detected IDV\nevents. Future simultaneous multi-wavelength monitoring is expected to discriminate them\nand tell us where such kind of IDV events come from.\nThe Australia Telescope Compact Array is part of the Australia Telescope which is\nfounded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility managed by\nthe CSIRO.\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China\n(grants 10573029, 10625314, 10633010 and 10821302) and the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. KJCX2-YW-T03), and sponsored by\nthe Program of Shanghai Subject Chief Scientist (06XD14024) and the National Key Basic\nResearch Development Program of China (No. 2007CB815405).\n\nREFERENCES\nBaganoff, F.K., et al. 2001, Nature, 413, 45\nBalick, B. & Brown, R.L. 1974, ApJ, 194, 265\nBardeen, J.M., Press, W.H., Teukolsky, S.A. 1972, ApJ, 178, 347\nBroderick, A.
