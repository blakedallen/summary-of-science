They\nwere derived from the celebrated Gaussian orthogonal\n(GOE), Gaussian unitary (GUE), and Gaussian symplectic (GSE) random matrix ensembles [2] in a purely formal\nway by dropping the Hermiticity constraint and, therefore, can be thought of as their direct non-Hermitean\ndescendants. Respectively coined as GinOE, GinUE,\nand GinSE, non-Hermitean random matrix models exhibited intriguingly rich mathematical structures whose\ncomplexity exceeded by far that of Hermitean random\nmatrix theory (RMT).\nFrom the physical point of view, non-Hermitean random matrices have proven to be as important [3] as their\nHermitean counterparts [4]. Ginibre's random matrices\nappear in the description of dissipative quantum maps [5]\n(GinUE), in the studies of dynamics [6] and the synchronisation effect [7] in random networks (GinOE), in the\nstatistical analysis of cross-hemisphere correlation matrix\nof the cortical electric activity [8] (GinOE), and in the\ncharacterisation of two-dimensional random space-filling\ncellular structures [9] (GinUE). They also arise in the\ncontext of \"directed quantum chaos\" [10, 11] (GinOE,\nGinUE, GinSE). Chiral deformations of non-Hermitean\nrandom matrices (GinOE, GinUE, GinSE) help elucidate\nuniversal aspects of the phenomenon of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics [12]:\nthe presence or absence of real eigenvalues singles out different breaking patterns. More recent findings [13] associate statistical models of non-Hermitean normal random\nmatrices with integrable structures of conformal maps\nand interface dynamics at both classical [14] and quantum scales [15]. For a comprehensive review of these and\nother physical applications, the reader is referred to Ref.\n[3].\nOut of the three non-Hermitean matrix models[1],\nGinibre's orthogonal ensemble defined \u0002by the probabil\u0001\u0003\n2\nity density PGinOE [H] = (2\u03c0)\u2212n /2 exp \u2212 tr HH T /2\nfor an n \u00d7 n real matrix H to occur is the least stud-\n\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.230201\n\nied and the most challenging. Perhaps, the great difficulties faced in statistical analysis of the GinOE can\nbe attributed to the fact that its, generically complex,\nspectrum (w1 , * * * , wn ) may contain a finite fraction of\nreal eigenvalues. This very peculiar feature of GinOE\ncan conveniently be accommodated by dividing the entire\nspace T(n) spanned by all real n \u00d7 n matrices H \u2208 T(n)\ninto (n + 1) mutually exclusive sectors T(n/k) associated with the matrices having\nSn exactly k real eigenvalues, such that T(n) = k=0 T(n/k). The sectors\nT(n/k), characterised by the partial probability densities PH\u2208T(n/k) (w1 , * * * , wn ), can be explored separately\nbecause they contribute additively to the joint probability density function (JPDF) of all n eigenvalues of H from\nT(n):\n\nPn (w1 , * * * , wn ) =\n\nn\nX\n\nk=0\n\nPH\u2208T(n/k) (w1 , * * * , wn ).\n\n(1)\n\nTwo spectral characteristics are of particular physical interest: (i) the partial (r1 , r2 )-point correlation functions\nobtained by integrating out all but r1 real and r2 complex\neigenvalues in PH\u2208T(n/k) , and (ii) the probability\n\npn,k =\n\nk Z\nY\n\ni=1\n\nd\u03bbi\nR\n\nl Z\nY\n\nj=1\n\nR\n\ndRe zj\n\nZ\n\ndIm zj PH\u2208T(n/k) (2)\n\nR+\n\nto find exactly k real eigenvalues in the spectrum of\nGinOE that additionally contains l pairs of complex conjugated eigenvalues, so that n = k + 2l. The probability\nfunction pn,k is the central object of our study, which, if\nconsidered in a wider context, aims to highlight an exclusive r\u00f4le played by symmetric functions in the description\nof GinOE.\nThe most important and general result available for\nGinOE is due to the breakthrough work by Lehmann and\nSommers [16] who proved, a quarter of a century after\nGinibre's work, that the k-th partial JPDF (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n)\nequals [17]\n\n\f2\n\nPH\u2208T(n/k) =\n\n\u00d7\n\nl\nY\n\nj=1\n\nl\nk\nk Y\nl\nk\nY\nY\nY\nY\n2l\u2212n(n+1)/4\n\u2212\u03bb2j /2\nQ\n|zi \u2212 zj |2 |zi \u2212 z\u0304j |2\ne\n(\u03bb\n\u2212\nz\n)(\u03bb\n\u2212\nz\u0304\n)\n|\u03bb\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n|\nj\ni\nj\ni\ni\nj\nn\nil k! l! j=1 \u0393(j/2) i>j=1\ni>j=1\nj=1\nj=1 i=1\n\n(zj \u2212 z\u0304j ) erfc\n\n\u0012\n\nzj \u2212 z\u0304j\n\u221a\ni 2\n\n\u0013\n\n2\n\n2\n\ne\u2212(zj +z\u0304j )/2 .\n\n(3)\n\nIn writing (3), we have used a representation due to Edelman [18] who rediscovered the result [16] a few years\nlater. The above JPDF is supported for (\u03bb1 , * * * , \u03bbk ) \u2208\nRk , (Re z1 , * * * , Re zl ) \u2208 Rl , and (Im z1 , * * * , Im zl ) \u2208\n(R+ )l . A particular case k = n of (3), corresponding\nto the matrices H \u2208 T(n/n) with all eigenvalues real,\nwas first derived by Ginibre [1].\nEquations (1) and (3) solve the problem of finding the\nJPDF of all n eigenvalues in GinOE. Despite this tremendous progress, a calculation of the (r1 , r2 )-point correlation function based on (3) turns out to be the problem,\nparticularly, because the well-developed machinery [2] of\nRMT, which was at use in studies of complex eigenvalue\ncorrelations in GinUE [1] and GinSE [19, 20], fails to\nwork in this case. In particular, the famous Dyson integration theorem [21] (Theorem 5.1.4 in Ref. [2]) is no\nlonger applicable to the study of spectral statistics in\nGinOE, as will be reasoned below. This failure clearly\nsignals of novel mathematical structures lurking behind\n(3).\nTo unveil and explore these structures, we wish to concentrate on the probability function pn,k . Previous attempts by Edelman and co-workers [18, 22] to attack the\nproblem brought no explicit formula for pn,k for generic\nk. The analytic results currently available include: (i)\nthe probability of having all n eigenvalues real equals\n[18] pn,n = 2\u2212n(n\u22121)/4 (this is the smallest probability\nout of all pn,k ); (ii) for all 0\u221a\u2264 k \u2264 n, the pn,k is of the\nform [18] pn,k = rn,k + sn,k 2, where rn,kPand sn,k are\nrational; (iii) the expected number En = nk=0 k pn,k of\nreal eigenvalues is given by [22]\n\nare exclusively determined by the partitions \u03bb of\nthe size |\u03bb| = l, where l is the number of pairs\nof complex-conjugated eigenvalues. The formula (6)\nuses a frequency representation [23] of those partitions\n\u03c3\n\u03bb = (l\u03c31 1 , * * * , lg g ). Experts in the theory of symmetric\nfunctions may readily recognise that our Fl 's are, up to\na factorial, so-called zonal polynomials [24]\n1\nZ l (p1 , * * * , pl ).\n(7)\nl! (1 )\nThey are tabulated in the manuscript [25] by Jack and\ncan also be efficiently calculated [24] by recursion. On the\ncontrary, the arguments pj 's of the multivariate polynomials in (5) are matrix model dependent:\nFl (p1 , * * * , pl ) =\n\npj = tr(0,[n/2]\u22121) \u033a\u02c6 j .\n\n(8)\n\n(The notation [x] stands for the integer part of x).

This highlights a strong connection between integrable structure of GinOE, integer\npartitions (6), and the theory of symmetric functions (7).\nStatement 2. The entire generating function for the\nprobabilities pn,n\u22122l can be reconstructed from (5). The\nfairly compact result\n[n/2]\n\nGn (z) =\n\nX\n\nz l pn,n\u22122l = pn,n det(11[n/2] + z \u033a\u02c6)\n\n(11)\n\nl=0\n\nwith the \u033a\u02c6 of needed parity provides us with yet another\nway of computing the entire set of pn,k 's at once. For\ncomparison of our analytic predictions with numeric simulations, see the Table I.\nStatement 3. The previously unknown JPDF of l\npairs of complex conjugated eigenvalues of a matrix\nH \u2208 T(n/k) is given by the formula (15).\nStatement 4. This statement is formulated in the form\nof the Pfaffian integration theorem (17) below. (It is\nhighly likely that this theorem will have implications far\nbeyond the scope of the present Letter).\nSketch of the derivation.-Because of the space limitations, only key points of the derivation will be presented\n\npn,n\nPH\u2208T(n/k) (z1 , z\u03041 , * * * , zl , z\u0304l ) =\nl!\n\nbelow; the technical details will be reported elsewhere\n[26].\nTo determine the probability function pn,k , defined by\n(2), we first integrate out all (\u03bb1 , * * * , \u03bbk ) in (3) which\ncan be viewed as a hybrid of GOE [2] and GinSE [19, 20].\nThe most efficient way to do so is to spot that the\nfirst line in (3), if taken without any prefactors therein,\nisQproportional to the average characteristic polynomial\nl\nh j=1 det(zj \u2212 H) det(z\u0304j \u2212 H)i of a k \u00d7 k random matrix H drawn from the GOE with the weight function\nexp(\u2212tr H 2 /2).

The Vandermonde determinant \u22062l ({z, z\u0304}) is calculated on the set of complex\neigenvalues (z1 , * * * , zl ; z\u03041 , * * * , z\u0304l ). The kernel function\nKn (z, z \u2032 ) in (12) is a so-called D-part [29] of the GOE\nmatrix kernel [2] that can be expressed [30] in terms of\narbitrary monic polynomials qj :\nKn (x, y) =\n\nn\u22121\n1 X\nqj (x) \u03bc\u0302jk qk (y).\n2\n\n(13)\n\nj,k=0\n\nThe real antisymmetric matrix \u03bc\u0302 is determined by its\ninverse\nZ\n2\n2\n1\ndx dy e\u2212(x +y )/2 sgn(y \u2212 x) qj (x) qk (y).\n(\u03bc\u0302\u22121 )jk =\n2 R2\n(14)\nSubstituting (12) into (2) completes the \u03bb-integration\ntherein, bringing a new result for the JPDF of l pairs\nof complex conjugated eigenvalues of H \u2208 T(n/k):\n\n\"\n#\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013l Y\nl\n2\n2\nzj \u2212 z\u0304j\n2\nK\n(z\n,\nz\n)\nK\n(z\n,\nz\u0304\n)\nn i j\nn i j\n\u221a\ne\u2212(zj +z\u0304j )/2 pf\nerfc\ni j=1\nKn (z\u0304i , zj ) Kn (z\u0304i , z\u0304j )\ni 2\n\n.

[20]), possibly triggering one to think that the remaining z-integrations in (2) could readily be\naccomplished by virtue of the Dyson integration theorem [2, 21]. Sadly, this is not the case because the D-part\nKn (z, z \u2032 ) of the GOE matrix kernel does not obey the projection property in the complex plane\nZ\n1\nd\u03b1(w) Kn (z, w\u0304) Kn (w, z \u2032 ) 6= Kn (z, z \u2032 )\n(16)\n2\nIm w>0\n\u221a\nwith respect to the measure d\u03b1(w) = erfc[(w \u2212 w\u0304)/i 2] exp[\u2212(w2 + w\u03042 )/2] d2 w from (15) (compare to the Lemma\n15.2.1 of Ref. [2]). Fortunately, the projection property is not actually necessary to carry out the integrations. We\nwere able to prove the following Pfaffian integration theorem [26].\nTheorem.-Let d\u03b1(z) be any benign measure on z \u2208 C, and the kernel function Kn (x, y) be an antisymmetric\n\n\f4\nfunction specified by (13). Then, the integration formula\n\"\n#\n\u0012 \u0013l Y\nl Z\n2\nKn (zi , zj ) Kn (zi , z\u0304j )\nd\u03b1(zj ) pf\ni j=1 zj \u2208C\nKn (z\u0304i , zj ) Kn (z\u0304i , z\u0304j )\n\nholds, provided the integrals in the l.h.s. exist.\nThe Pfaffian integration formula contains particular\nzonal polynomials [24] Z(1l ) whose arguments are traces\nof \u03c3\u0302 j with\nZ\nn\u22121\nX\n\u03c3\u0302\u03b1,\u03b2 = i\n\u03bc\u0302\u03b1,k d\u03b1(z) [qk (z) q\u03b2 (z\u0304) \u2212 q\u03b2 (z) qk (z\u0304)] .\nk=0\n\n(18)\nOperationally, the proof [26] is based on a topological\ninterpretation of the permutational expansion of Pfaffian\nin (17) combined with term-by-term integration.\nEquipped with this theorem, we are ready to complete\nthe z-integrations in (2). The calculation is most economic in the basis where monic polynomials qj 's coincide\nwith GOE skew-orthogonal polynomials. For n = 2m\neven, they are given by [2]\nq2j+1 (x) = 2\u2212(2j+1) H2j+1 (x) \u2212 2\u2212(2j\u22121) j H2j\u22121 (x),\nq2j (x) = 2\u22122j H2j (x),\n(19)\nso that\n\u03bc\u0302jk =\n\n1 + (\u22121)j\n1 + (\u22121)k\n\u221a\n\u221a \u03b4j,k\u22121 .\n\u03b4\n\u2212\nj,k+1\n21\u2212k k! \u03c0\n21\u2212j j! \u03c0\n\n= Z(1l )\n2l\u00d72l\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\ntr(0,n\u22121) \u03c3\u0302 1 , * * * , tr(0,n\u22121) \u03c3\u0302 l\n2\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n(17)\n\ndoes not scale with the matrix dimension n. The largen formulae of this kind would facilitate a comparison of\nour exact theory with existing experimental [8] and numerical (see the second paper in Ref. [12]) data. (ii)\nThe calculation of all (r1 , r2 )-point correlation functions\nfor GinOE as defined below (1) is yet another important\nproblem to tackle. We believe that progress in this direction can be achieved through a proper extension of the\nPfaffian integration theorem (17).\nWe thank T. Seligman for kind hospitality at the Centro Internacional de Ciencias (CIC) in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where this work was initiated. Clarifying correspondence with A. Borodin (Caltech), V. B. Kuznetsov\n(Leeds) and G. Olshanski (IITP, Moscow) is greatly appreciated. A part of this work was done during the visits\nto Brunel University West London (E.K.) and University\nof Warwick (E.K. and G.A.) supported by a BRIEF grant\nfrom Brunel University. The research by E.K. was partially supported by the Israel Science Foundation through\nthe grant No 286/04.\n\n(20)\n\nSubstituting (19) and (20) into (18), and taking into account (17), we reproduce the announced solution (5) \u2013\n(9) after a bit lengthy but straightforward calculations.\nThe case n = 2m + 1 odd can be treated similarly [26]\nleading to the same solution but with (9) replaced by\n(10).\nIt remains to establish the result (11) for the generating\nfunction Gn (z). It stems from the summation formula\n!\n\u221e\nr\nX\nX\nzr\nr\u22121 pr z\n(21)\nZ(1r ) (p1 , * * * , pr ) = exp\n(\u22121)\nr!\nr\nr=0\nr\u22651\n\nwell known in the theory of symmetric functions [24].\nIdentifying pr = tr(0,[n/2]\u22121) \u033a\u02c6r , the exponent in (21) can\nbe evaluated explicitly to confirm (11).\nConclusion.-To summarise, the exact solution was\npresented for the probability pn,k to find precisely k real\neigenvalues in the spectrum of an n \u00d7 n random matrix\ndrawn from GinOE. Expressed in terms of zonal polynomials, the solution associates the integrable structure of\nGinOE with the theory of symmetric functions.\nCertainly, more work is needed to accomplish the spectral theory of GinOE. (i) In particular, the large-n behavior [26] of the probability function pn,k should be examined when the number k of real eigenvalues does or\n\n[1] J. Ginibre, J. Math. Phys. 6, 440 (1965).\n[2] M.
