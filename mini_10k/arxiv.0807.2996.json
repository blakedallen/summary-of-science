Fast partons\nare created by hard transverse scattering in the early\nmoments of a heavy-ion collision and have long been\nconsidered a useful probe in understanding the QGP.\nThe primary emphasis has focused on the process of jet\nquenching in which fast partons lose energy and momentum by interacting with the surrounding medium\n(see, for instance, Refs. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]). Recently, the question of how the energy and momentum\ndeposited by the fast parton affects the bulk behavior of\nan evolving QGP has gained attention (see, e.g., Refs.\n[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]). Interest in understanding the medium's response to the passage of a\nfast parton has been spurred on by experimental measurements at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC)\n[19, 20, 21] of hadron correlation functions which suggest\nthe fast parton may produce a propagating Mach cone in\n\nFIG. 1: Some of the distance scales relevant to the hydrodynamic response of a weakly coupled QGP to fast partons.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: rbn2@phy.duke.edu\n\nthe medium.\nThere is strong evidence [22, 23] that the matter produced at RHIC obeys the hydrodynamic assumption of\nlocal thermal equilibrium. For this reason, the common\ntheoretical approach to examining the QGP's response\nto a fast parton has been to treat it as a source of energy\nand momentum coupled to the hydrodynamic equations\nof the medium. This makes sense provided the medium\nmaintains local thermal equilibrium following the passage\nof a fast parton. Assuming the medium does respond\nhydrodynamically to a fast parton then raises the question of what the distribution of energy and momentum\ndeposited is. It has been observed [9, 11, 17] that the\nmedium's response to fast partons is sensitive to the specific form of energy and momentum deposition, creating\nthe need for a hydrodynamic source term derived from\nfirst principles.\nIt is instructive to consider the mechanism of energy\nand momentum deposition and the different scales involved. In a quantum chromodynamic (QCD) plasma\nfast partons interact with the medium at a distance scale\nof the order of the inverse Debye mass, (mD )\u22121 . This\ninteraction creates a disturbance, which in turn interacts with the surrounding medium, creating a new disturbance at some larger distance scale. The new disturbance again interacts with the surrounding medium, and\neventually the initial disturbance propagates outward to\nsome arbitrarily large distance scale. At distances much\ngreater than the mean free path, \u039bf , the medium's response to the initial disturbance can be accurately described by hydrodynamics. Thus an effective QCD hydrodynamic source term should include the medium's response up to distances of order \u039bf , at which point the\nsystem evolves hydrodynamically. Whether the plasma\nis weakly or strongly coupled, the initial energy and momentum deposition occurs at a distance scale of the order\nof the inverse Debye mass, although the specific value of\nthe Debye mass depends on the strength of the coupling.\nHowever, in a strongly coupled plasma, the concept of a\nmean free path loses meaning, and instead the de Broglie\n\n\f2\nwavelength sets the minimum scale at which the hydrodynamical description is valid. In general, the application\nof hydrodynamics is valid on shorter distance scales for\nmore strongly coupled mediums.\nRecently, Neufeld [25] presented a derivation of the\nhydrodynamic source term expected from a fast parton moving through a perturbative QGP, both with and\nwithout including the effect of color screening, by including the medium response at a distance scale of the order (mD )\u22121 . Using the unscreened, relativistic form of\nthis source term coupled to the linearized hydrodynamical equations of the medium the authors of Ref. [18]\nshowed that the medium response includes a propagating sound wave with the shape of a Mach cone and a\ndiffusive wake. In this work, I will use a slightly modified\nform of the relativistic limit of this source term in the\nlinearized hydrodynamical equations of the medium. A\ndetailed solution of the equations of motion will be presented along with the resulting dynamics for a range of\nvalues of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, \u03b7/s,\nand speed of sound, cs . I will also expand the source term\nup to first order in a series of gradients of a \u03b4 function\nand compare to the full result, in an effort to understand\nthe relevance of finite source structure. It will be shown\nthat the medium response is sensitive to the finite source\nstructure up to distances of several fm from the source\nparton for the source term used here.\nIn a weakly coupled QCD plasma at high temperature\nT , the inverse Debye mass is of order (gT )\u22121 , where g\nis the running coupling, whereas the transport mean free\npath is of order (g 4 T )\u22121 [24]. The medium's response\nto disturbances at distance scales between (gT )\u22121 and\n(g 4 T )\u22121 is accurately described by the Boltzmann equation (see Fig. 1). The hydrodynamic source term examined here includes the medium's response at a distance scale of the order of the inverse Debye mass, at\nwhich point the medium's hydrodynamic response is invoked. This is a simplification of the true QCD evolution, where the medium's evolution between (gT )\u22121 and\n(g 4 T )\u22121 should be described by the Boltzmann equation,\nafter which the hydrodynamic response can be invoked.\nHowever, in the QGP produced at RHIC, it is likely that\nthe mean free path is comparable in size to the inverse\nDebye mass (compare, for instance, Refs. [26] and [27]).\nThus, from a phenomenological point of view, physics at\na distance scale of the order (mD )\u22121 may be relevant to\nthe specific structure of the medium's hydrodynamic response to fast partons. However, this also suggests the\nQGP produced at RHIC may be strongly coupled, limiting the application of perturbation theory.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Sec.II I consider the general form of linearized hydrodynamics with\na source term. I then introduce the specific source term\nstudied here. In Sec.III the source term is expanded in\nterms of gradients of a \u03b4 function up to first order. Both\nthe full source term and the \u03b4 function expanded form\nare then Fourier transformed into momentum space. In\nSec.IV the hydrodynamic equations are solved in terms\n\nof a one-dimensional numerical integration. In Sec.V results are given for both the full source and the \u03b4 function\nexpanded version, as well as different values of the viscosity and speed of sound. In what follows I choose units\nsuch that ~ = c = kb = 1.\nII.\n\nLINEARIZED HYDRODYNAMICS WITH A\nSOURCE TERM\n\nThe first-order hydrodynamical equations for a\nmedium with nonzero shear viscosity \u03b7 in the presence\nof a source term J \u03bd are given by\n\u2202\u03bc T \u03bc\u03bd = J \u03bd ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere T \u03bc\u03bd is the energy-momentum tensor of the system.\nIf one assumes that the energy and momentum density\ndeposited by the fast parton is small compared to the\nequilibrium energy density of the medium, the hydrodynamical equations [Eq. (1)] can be linearized. Defining\nT \u03bc\u03bd = T0\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b4T \u03bc\u03bd , where \u03b4T \u03bc\u03bd is the perturbation of\nthe energy-momentum tensor resulting from the source\nin an otherwise static medium, one has\n\u2202\u03bc \u03b4T \u03bc\u03bd = J \u03bd ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2202\u03bc T0\u03bc\u03bd = 0 and \u03b4T \u03bc\u03bd is given by [9]\n\u03b4T 00 \u2261 \u03b4\u01eb, \u03b4T 0i \u2261 g,\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(3)\n3\n2\n\u03b4T ij = \u03b4ij c2s \u03b4\u01eb \u2212 \u0393s \u2202 i g j + \u2202 j g i \u2212 \u03b4ij \u2207 * g .\n4\n3\n\nIn Eqs.\n\n(3) cs denotes the speed of sound, \u0393s \u2261\n4\u03b7\n= 3sT\nis the sound attenuation length, and \u01eb0\nand p0 are the unperturbed energy density and pressure,\nrespectively.\nBy introducing the general rule for Fourier transforms\nZ\nZ\n1\n3\nF (x, t) =\nd\nk\nd\u03c9 eik*x\u2212i\u03c9t F (k, \u03c9),\n(4)\n(2\u03c0)4\n4\u03b7\n3(\u01eb0 +p0 )\n\nthe equations given by Eq.

Similarly, one has from\nEqs. (5) and (8)\nkgL = \u2212iJ 0 + \u03c9\u03b4\u01eb\n\nin the relativistic limit (\u03b3 = (1\u2212u2 )\u22121/2 \u226b 1), the source\nis given by\n\u0001\n(15)\nJ \u03bd (x) = J 0 (x), uJ 0 (x) \u2212 Jv\nwhere\n\n(9)\n\n\uf8eb\n\ni\u03c9 k\u0302JL (k, \u03c9) + ic2s kJ 0 (k, \u03c9)\n.\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 c2s k 2 + i\u0393s \u03c9k 2\n\n(10)\n\nThe transverse part of g can be obtained from Eq. (6).\nThe calculation is simplified by considering that any part\nof g proportional to k is a part of gL . This leaves\ngT (k, \u03c9) = g \u2212 gL =\n\niJT (k, \u03c9)\n.\n\u03c9 + 34 i\u0393s k 2\n\n(11)\n\nEquation (11) is a diffusion equation and the quantity\ngT is interpreted as diffusive momentum density generated by the fast parton. Equations (8) and (10) describe\ndamped sound waves propagating at speed cs : it follows\nthat \u03b4\u01eb and gL are interpreted as the energy and momentum density carried by sound generated by the fast parton. The importance of the explicit form of the source\nterm can be readily seen. In a homogeneous medium\nsymmetries ensure that the source vector, J, can be written generally as\nJ(x, t) = u p(r) + \u2207q(r)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere u is the velocity of the source particle and p(r)\nand q(r) are scalar functionspof the (possibly Lorentzcontracted) magnitude r = (x \u2212 ut)2 . If we instead\nwrite Eq. (12) in momentum space we have\nZ\nZ\nJ(k, \u03c9) = u d4 x eik*x p(r) + ik d4 x eik*x q(r) (13)\nand JT is found to be\nk(k * J)\nJT (k, \u03c9) = J \u2212\n2\n\u0012 2 k\n\u0013Z\nuk \u2212 k(k * u)\n=\nd4 x eik*x p(r)\nk2\n\n(14)\n\nso that q(r) does not contribute to JT . If one chooses\nthe source [Eq. (12)] such that p(r) = 0 then there is no\nexcitation of the diffusive momentum density. It is clear\nthat the hydrodynamics of the system are sensitive to\nthe specific form of the source term. In particular, terms\nthat are in the form of a gradient only generate sound.\nAs mentioned previously, in this work I use the source\nterm derived in Ref. [25]. There, the fast parton was\ntreated as the source of an external color field interacting\nwith a perturbative QGP through a Vlasov equation.

DELTA FUNCTION EXPANSION AND\nMOMENTUM SPACE REPRESENTATION OF\nTHE SOURCE\n\nAt distances increasingly far from the fast parton, one\nexpects that the source term will begin to look like a \u03b4\nfunction. Since hydrodynamics is a long distance effective theory, the hydrodynamic solutions (in the range of\nvalidity) should be dominated by the lowest order terms\nin an expansion of gradients of a \u03b4 function centered at\nthe location of the source parton (a detailed discussion\nof this is given in [16]). Higher order terms in the expansion, which are sensitive to the detailed structure of\nthe source term, will become less important at larger distances. In this section, I will expand the source term, as\ngiven by (16) and (20), up to first order in gradients of\na \u03b4 function. Later, the hydrodynamic equations, (8),\n(10), (11), will be solved for both the full source term\n\n\f4\nand the truncated series. A comparison of the solutions\nwill highlight at what distance scales the detailed structure of the source term becomes negligible. It will prove\nconvenient to Fourier transform the source into momentum space, which I will also do in this section, before\nattempting to solve the hydrodynamic equations. The\neffect of color screening, which is absent in (16) and (20),\nwill be modelled by including a damping factor of the\nform e\u2212\u03c1 m , where m\u22121 is a typical screening scale. In a\nperturbative QGP the inverse screening scale is given by\nmD = gT , which appears as a coefficient in front of the\nsource term used here. However, in principle, at higher\norders the screening scale may be different than what\nappears as the coefficient of the source term. It is thus\ninstructive to keep m arbitrary; however, in solving the\nhydrodynamical equations in Sec.IV I will set m = gT .\nAlso, when necessary, a short distance cutoff will be used\nto regulate ultraviolet divergences. A common choice,\nwhich will also be used here, for the p\nshort distance cutoff\nin collisional energy loss is \u03c1min = (2 Ep T )\u22121 , where Ep\nis the energy of the fast parton (see, for instance, [30]).\nConsider (16), which can be expanded as\nJ 0 (\u03c1, z, t) = C0 \u03b4(x\u2212 ) + C1 * \u2207\u03b4(x\u2212 ) + . . .\n\n(22)\n\nThe coefficients, C0 and C1 , are found by taking the appropriate moment of J 0 (\u03c1, z, t). Introducing the damping\nfactor, e\u2212\u03c1 m , one has for C0 ,\nZ\nC0 = d3 x J 0 (\u03c1, z, t) e\u2212\u03c1 m\nZ\n\u03b1s (Qap )2 m2D \u03b3u2 \u2212\u03c1 m\n= d3 x\ne\n2 )3/2\n(23)\n8\u03c0(\u03c12 + \u03b3 2 z\u2212\n!\n\u03b1s (Qap )2 m2D u2\nm\np\nG0\n=\n,\n2\n2 Ep T\np\nwhere (2 Ep T )\u22121 has been introduced as a short distance cutoff, and G0 is a representation of the incomplete\n\n\u03b1s (Qap )2 m2D u2\n(2\u03c0)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 ukz )\nJ (k, \u03c9) =\n2\n0\n\nG0 (z) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\n\nz\n\ne\u2212t\n.\nt\n\n\u03b1s (Qap )2 m2D u2\n2\n!\n!\nm\n\u03c0u\np\n\u2202z \u03b4(x\u2212 ) + . . .\n\u00d7 G0\n+\n4 m\u03b3\n2 Ep T\n(26)\n\n0\nJD\n(\u03c1, z, t) =\n\nwhere the subscript D is meant to indicate the expansion\nin gradients of a \u03b4 function.

To do this, it is necessary to first transform the source terms into momentum\nspace, following the general rule (4).

(28) and (29)\nwill be used in the next section to solve for the hydrodynamic variables of the medium.\nAs discussed at the beginning of the section, at distances increasingly far from the fast parton the source\nterm is dominated by the lowest order terms in an expansion of gradients of a \u03b4 function. It's clear from inspection that the detailed structure of the full source term,\ngiven by (28), becomes important at a momentum scale\nk \u223c m. This could have been anticipated, since the full\nsource term is calculated up to distances of the order of\nthe screening length.

This will be done in the next section.\n\nIV.\n\nSOLVING THE EQUATIONS\n\nThe result given by (28) is combined with equations (8), (10), and (11) to yield \u03b4\u01eb(k, \u03c9), gL (k, \u03c9) and\ngT (k, \u03c9). These are then transformed back to position\nspace using the relation (4). In \u03b4\u01eb(k, \u03c9) and gL (k, \u03c9), one\ncan find JL by taking k\u0302 * J, which is written conveniently\nas\n\n!\n!\n\u0012q\n\u0013!\nmD + kT\ni\u03c0u2\ni\u03c0(u * k)\n2\n2\np\nG0\n+\n+ p 2\nkT + mD \u2212 mD\n4\u03b3\n2 Ep T\n4\u03b3 kT + m2D\n\u0013\n\u0012q\n\u03b1s (Qap )2 m2D u2\n(u * k)J 0\ni\u03c0u2\nkT2 + m2D \u2212 mD\n=\n+\n(2\u03c0)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 ukz )\nk\n2k\n4\u03b3\n(30)\n\n\u03b1s (Qap )2 m2D u2\n(2\u03c0)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 ukz ) (u * k)\nJL =\n2k\n\nwhere I am now taking m = mD . After integrating out \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 ukz ) and using (A-5), the expression for \u03b4\u01eb(x, t) is given\nby\n\u03b4\u01eb(x, t) =\n\nZ\n\u03b1s (Qap )2 m2D u2 \u03bb2\nkT J0 (\u03c1kT )eikz (z\u2212ut)\n\u00d7\ndkT dkz\n2\n2\n8\u03c0 cs\nkz2 \u2212 \u03bb2 kT2 + i\u03c3\n!\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013!\n\u0001 \u03c0u2 q 2\nmD + kT\ni\u03c0ukz\n2\n2\np\nG0\n2iukz \u2212 \u0393s k \u2212\n+ p 2\nkT + mD \u2212 mD\n4\u03b3\n2 Ep T\n4\u03b3 kT + m2D\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u03bb2 = c2s /(u2 \u2212 c2s ), \u03c3 = \u0393s u(\u03bb2 /c2s )kz (kT2 + kz2 ) and I am again working in plane polar coordinates. The integral\nover kz can be performed using contour integration. Poles are located at kz = \u00b1(kT2 \u03bb2 \u2213 i|\u03c3|)1/2 , where |\u03c3| is itself\na function of kz . When evaluating the residues at these poles I make the approximation \u03c3(kz ) \u2248 \u03c3(\u00b1kT \u03bb). This\napproximation is valid at momentum scales for which the sound attenuation is small (kT \u226a c2s /\u0393s ), which should be\nreasonable in the hydrodynamic limit. Both poles are located in the lower complex plane so that the integration only\ncontributes for z < ut, i. e., behind the source parton.

All calculations are\nperformed for a gluon moving along the positive z axis\nat position ut and speed u = 0.99955c (\u03b3 \u2248 33). The\nstrong coupling, \u03b1s , is chosen to be 1/\u03c0, the temperature\nis taken to be T = 350 MeV, and Ep = 16 GeV. As mentioned in the introduction, I will compare the solutions\nresulting from the full source term and the \u03b4 function expanded source term, given by (28) and (29), respectively.\nI will also make a comparison of the results for a range\nof values of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio,\n\u03b7/s, and speed of sound, cs .\nThe solutions resulting from the the full source term\nand the \u03b4 function source are shown in Figures 2 and 3.\nIn both Figures\n\u221a the results are plotted for \u03b7/s = 1/4\u03c0\nand cs = c/ 3. Figure 2(a) shows a contour plot of\n\u03b4\u01eb(x, t) for each source. In both cases a well define Mach\ncone is visible in the trailing medium. Figure 2(b) shows\nthe result for the magnitude of the momentum density,\n|g| = |gL (x, t) + gT (x, t)|. One now sees both a sound\n\nG0\n\nmD\np\n2 Ep T\n\n!\n\n\u03c0 kT\n\u2213\n8\u03b3mD\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(38)\n\ncontribution from gL (x, t), which excites a Mach cone,\nand a diffusive contribution from gT (x, t), which is excited in the region directly behind the source gluon. The\ndiffusive momentum density produces flow almost exclusively in the direction of the source parton's velocity,\nwhile the Mach cone generates flow outward and perpendicular to it's boundary, as indicated by the arrows. One\ncan see from Figure 2 that the full source term and the \u03b4\nfunction expanded source term provide qualitatively similar results, particularly in the region far from the source\nparton. In the region near z\u2212 = 0, the full source solution has a noticeably larger transverse extent than the\ncorresponding \u03b4 source result. A more quantitative comparison can be made by examining Figure 3 where \u03b4\u01eb(x, t)\nis plotted as a function of z\u2212 for fixed \u03c1. Here one sees\nthat the two results converge at a distance of about 5-6\nfm behind the source parton for the chosen \u03c1 values.\nResults are next presented for three different values of\nthe shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, \u03b7/s. The first\nvalue chosen for \u03b7/s is 1/4\u03c0 \u2248 0.08, which has been proposed [28] as a universal lower bound for all relativistic\nquantum field theories and is calculated in the strongly\ncoupled limit. The other two values for \u03b7/s are multiples of the previous value, 3/4\u03c0 and 6/4\u03c0, and are more\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Plots of (a): the perturbed energy density, and (b): the perturbed momentum density, for both the\nfull source term and the \u03b4 function expanded source term. Here, \u03b7/s = 1/4\u03c0 and cs = 0.57. The direction of the momentum\ndensity is indicated by the arrows.\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) A comparison of the perturbed energy density generated by the full source term and the \u03b4 function\nexpanded source term for two different values of \u03c1. The two results converge at a distance of about 5-6 fm behind the source\nparton for the chosen values of \u03c1.\n\nconsistent with the application of perturbation theory,\nwhich is the method used to calculate the source used\nin this paper. For example, Arnold et al. [29] found for\nthe leading order result \u03b7/s = 0.48 for a gluonic plasma\nwith \u03b1s = 0.3. More recently, Xu and Greiner found\n\n\u03b7/s = 0.13 for a gluonic plasma with the same value of\n\u03b1s by going beyond leading order in the diluteness of\nthe medium [31]. A small value of the shear viscosity,\nwhich is required by the RHIC data [32], is not necessarily incompatible with perturbation theory, especially if\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Plots of (a): the perturbed energy density, and (b): the perturbed momentum density for different\nvalues of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, \u03b7/s. The black lines in (a) are drawn where one would expect to find\nthe boundary of a Mach cone in the absence of dissipative effects. Plots scaled by the radius, \u03c1, which factor in the conical\nbroadening of the cone, are shown in Figure 5.\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Plots of (a): the total perturbed energy density, and (b): the total perturbed momentum density,\ncontained at a given radius in the \u03c1 \u2212 z\u2212 plane for different values of \u03b7/s. As one can see in (b) the total perturbed momentum\ndensity carried by the sonic Mach cone exceeds that contained in the diffusive wake.\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Plots of (a): the perturbed energy density, and (b): the perturbed momentum density for different\nvalues of the speed of sound, cs . Plots scaled by the radius, \u03c1, which factor in the conical broadening of the cone, are shown\nin Figure 7.\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Plots of (a): the total perturbed energy density, and (b): the total perturbed momentum density,\ncontained at a given radius in the \u03c1 \u2212 z\u2212 plane for different values of cs . The magnitude of the Mach cone, when integrated,\nis similar for the different plots.\n\n\f11\nthe viscosity is lowered by anomalous contributions [33].\nThe results for \u03b4\u01eb(x, t) and |g| = |gL (x, t) + gT (x, t)|\nfor all three viscosities\nare shown in Figures 4 and 5,\n\u221a\nwhere cs = c/ 3. The black lines in the contour plots\nof Figure 4(a) are drawn along the slope x = \u00b1\u03bb(z \u2212 ut)\nwhich is where one would expect to find the boundary of a\nMach cone in the absence of dissipative effects. In Figure\n5, the total energy density (figure (a)), and magnitude\nof momentum density (figure (b)), contained at a given\nradius are shown. It is clear from the plots that the Mach\ncone broadens and weakens as the viscosity is increased.\nFinally, results are shown for three different values of\nthe speed of sound, cs . The first value is cs = 0.57, which\nis the the limiting value for a conformal ideal relativistic\ngas, while the other two values are cs = 0.45, 0.3. It's\nlikely that the QGP produced at RHIC experiences a\nspeed of sound close to all three of these values during\nits evolution [34]. The results are shown in Figures 6 and\n7, where I have chosen \u03b7/s = 1/4\u03c0. One should note that\nthe diffusive contribution, gT (x, t), is independent of the\nspeed of sound.\nIt is interesting to consider how the results presented\nhere compare to experimental data. In the di-hadron correlation functions measured at RHIC there is a double\npeak structure in the back-jet (source parton) distribution which has been interpreted by some as the result of\nMach cone generated flow. In the spectrum presented\nhere one indeed finds Mach cone generated flow but also\nfinds a substantial diffusive flow, which seems to be missing from the RHIC data. In order to make a comparison,\nhowever, one must consider that the matter created in\nheavy ion collisions at RHIC rapidly expands in contrast\nto the static background assumed here. The diffusive\nmomentum is deposited locally and is thus probably difficult to observe in an expanding medium. On the other\nhand, the Mach cone propagates at the speed of sound,\nwhich is of the same order of magnitude as the expansion\nvelocities in the matter produced at RHIC, and is likely\nmore readily observed experimentally.\nCare should be taken when examining the azimuthal\nparticle spectrum generated by a fast parton using\nan isochronous Cooper-Frye freeze-out from a static\nmedium, such as in the work done by Betz et al. [35].\nIn their paper, the authors compared the perturbative QCD based source term studied here with one derived in the strongly coupled Ads/CFT correspondence\n[16]. Their conclusion was that the anomalous azimuthal\nhadron correlations observed at RHIC are likely the result of flow generated by the non-equilibrium Neck zone\nin the Ads/CFT case, a contribution which does not obey\nMach's law [36]. In the isochronous Cooper-Frye freezeout scenario the entire volume of matter is assumed to\nhadronize at the same time, independent of physical processes. This is in contrast to the freeze-out in a heavy ion\ncollision, which occurs as the result of an expanding and\ncooling medium. The effect of an isochronous freeze-out\nscenario is that any cylindrically symmetric, or conical,\ncontributions tend to be washed out (see the discussion\n\nin [37]). Any rigorous comparison to experimental results will require incorporating a realistic source term in\nan expanding medium.\nIn summary, I have here presented in detail a method\nof solution for the linearized hydrodynamical equations\nof a QGP coupled to the source term generated by a\nfast parton. The solution has been examined for different values of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio\nand speed of sound. Additionally, the relevance of finite\nsource structure has been investigated by performing an\nexpansion in gradients of a \u03b4 function centered at the location of the source parton. Comparison of the medium\nresponse generated by the full source with that generated\nby the \u03b4 expanded one shows that the result is sensitive\nto the finite structure up to distances of several fm from\nthe fast parton for the source examined here.\nAcknowledgments: I thank Berndt M\u00fcller for many discussions and advice.
