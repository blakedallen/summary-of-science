The nontrivial correlation of thermal light is the result of multiphoton interference.\nPACS numbers: PACS Number: 03.65.Bz, 42.50.Dv\n\nIn 1956, Hanbruy-Brown and Twiss (HBT) discovered\na surprising photon bunching effect of thermal light[1].\nIn a spatial HBT interferometer, the spatially, randomly\ndistributed thermal light was observed to have a twotimes greater chance of being captured by two individual\nphotodetectors in a small, transverse area of correlation\nequal to the coherent area of the thermal radiation than\nthat of being captured in different coherent areas. For a\nlarge angular sized thermal source the spatial correlation\nis effectively within a physical \"point\". The point-topoint near-field spatial correlation of thermal light has\nbeen utilized for reproducing nonlocal ghost images in a\nlensless configuration [2]. In a temporal HBT interferometer, the temporally, randomly radiated photons seem to\nhave a two-times greater chance to be measured within a\nshort time window which equals the coherence time of the\nthermal field than that of being measured in two different\ncoherence time windows. For a natural thermal radiation\nsource, such as the Sun, its coherence time could be as\nshort as femtoseconds. It seems that the photons are\nmore likely to come together and arrive at the detectors\nsimultaneously if we try to detect them at some special\nspace-time positions. This behavior is phenomenologically explained as \"photon bunching\" [3]. What is the\nphysical cause of photon bunching? We believe this is\na reasonable question to ask. It seems that there is no\nreason to have photons created in pairs from a thermal\nsource. The radiation process of thermal light is stochastic. The radiated photons should be created randomly in\nthe source, rather than bunching in pairs. In fact, this\nbunching effect seems even more strange for N th-order\ncorrelation measurements of thermal light, in which more\nthan two photo-detections are involved. Quantum theory\npredicts that N photons have N ! times greater chance of\nbeing captured within the same coherent time window of\nthe light field than that of being captured in N different\ncoherent time window of the light field[4].\nRecently, several papers reported high order ghost\nimaging and ghost interference experiments by using a\npseudo-thermal source[5]. In their experiments, the authors treated the electromagnetic field from the pseudothermal source as Gaussian random variables. Since for\n\nGaussian random variables any moments of order higher\nthan 2 can always be expressed in terms of the first and\nsecond order moments, they measured high order moments of pseudo-thermal light by measuring the first and\nsecond order moments with one or two CCD's, then calculated the higher order moments[6].\nIn this letter, we wish to report a three-photon temporal correlation measurement of pseudo-thermal light in\nwhich three photodetectors are involved in a three-fold\njoint measurement. The difference between our experiment and the experiments mentioned above is that in\nour experiment we use single photon detectors to directly\nmeasure the high order correlation function of pseudothermal light. We use quantum theory to describe the\nlight field because it reveals the underlying physics and\nis applicable to the case when the intensity is so low that\nonly a few photons are in the system. The experimental results show that the three individual photodetectors\nD1 , D2 and D3 have a six times greater chance of being\ntriggered at t1 = t2 = t3 than that of being triggered at\nt1 6= t2 6= t3 , apparently indicating that the photons are\nemitted in \"triples\" by the thermal source.\nChaotic\nTheraml Source\n\nD2\n\nC.C\n\nRotaing\nGround Glass\n\nD3\nD1\n\nBS1\n\nBS2\n\nPinhole\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic setup of the experiment.\n\nThe schematic experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe light source is a standard pseudo-thermal source,\nwhich contains a CW laser beam, a fast rotating diffusing ground glass and a focal lens (with 25.4mm focal\nlength). The 632.8nm laser beam is focused by a lens,\nonto the rotating ground glass, to a diameter of \u2264100\u03bcm.\nThe coherent laser beam is scattered by the fast rotating ground glass to simulate a thermal field with \u223c0.2\u03bcs\n\n\f2\ncoherence time. The coherence time of pseudo-thermal\nlight is determined by the angular speed of the disk, the\ncurvature of the focused laser beam and the transverse\ndistance between the pinhole and the laser beam, the\ndetailed discussion can be found in Ref.[8]. Effectively,\nthe rotating ground glass produces a large number of\nindependent point sub-sources (3 to 5 \u03bcm in diameter)\nwith independent random phases. A pinhole with a diameter size \u223c 1mm is placed 800mm from the ground\nglass to select a small portion of the radiation within its\nspatial coherence area. At this distance the size of coherent area is about \u223c 10mm. The pseudo-thermal light\npasses through beam-splitters BS1 and BS2. The transmitted radiation is detected by photodetector D1 , the reflected radiations are detected by photodetectors D2 and\nD3 , respectively. To simplify the discussion, we achieved\nequal intensities in the three paths by manipulating the\ntransimission-reflection coefficients of the two beamsplitters and had equal distances between the light source\nand the three photodetectors. D1 , D2 , and D3 are fast\navalanche photodiodes working in the photon counting\nregime. The photo-detection response time is on the order of a few hundred picoseconds, which is much shorter\nthan the \u223c 0.2\u03bcs coherence time of the radiation. The\noutput pulses from D1 , D2 and D3 are sent to a threefold coincidence counting circuit which provides a threephoton counting histogram as a function of t1 \u2212 t2 and\nt1 \u2212t3 , where tj , j = 1, 2, 3, is the registration time of the\nphoto-detection event at D1 , D2 and D3 , respectively.\nThe experimentally measured and simulated 3-D thirdorder temporal correlation functions are reported in the\nupper and lower parts of Fig. 2, respectively. The simulation is calculated based on Eq. (5). It is easy to see\nthat (1) the measured correlation function is close to the\nsimulated function, and (2) the randomly radiated \"thermal photons\" have much greater chance of being jointly\ndetected in triples when t1 = t2 = t3 than that of being\ndetected when t1 6= t2 6= t3 .\nFrom Eq. (5) we know that in order to claim the measured correlation is a third order effect the contrast between the peak and the background should be lager than\n4 to 1, corresponding to a visibility larger than 60%.\nTo compare the joint counting rate at t1 = t2 = t3\n(three-photon bunching) with the joint counting rate at\nt1 6= t2 6= t3 , a sliced \"cross section\" of the measured\n3-D histogram is illustrated in Fig. 3. The plot is a 2-D\ncross section of Fig. 2(b) sliced from the top left corner\nto the bottom right corner. The contrast between the\nmaximum counting rate, which occurs at t1 = t2 = t3 ,\nand the constant background is 4.9 \u00b1 0.25 to 1, indicating\na nontrivial third-order correlation function with visibility of \u223c 66%, which is greater than the 2 to 1 contrast\n(33% visibility) of HBT. This result shows that thermal\nlight has a much greater chance to be bunched in triples,\nrather than in pairs. The theoretically expected contrast\nis 6 to 1 (71% visibility). In addition, the single detector\n\nFIG. 2: (Color Online) Measured (upper, a and b) and calculated (lower, c and d) third-order temporal correlation function of thermal light. The 3-D three-photon joint detection histogram is plotted as a function of t13 \u2261 t1 \u2212 t3 and\nt23 \u2261 t2 \u2212 t3 . The simulation function is calculated from\nEq. (5). In addition, the single detector counting rates for\nD1 , D2 , and D3 are all monitored to be constants.\n\nFIG. 3: (Color Online) Crosse section of the three-photon\ncoincidence counting histogram, which is sliced from the top\nleft corner to the bottom right corner of Fig. 2b. The contrast\nbetween the maximum counting rate and the constant background is 4.9 \u00b1 0.25 to 1, indicating a nontrivial third-order\ncorrelation function with visibility of \u223c 66%.\n\ncounting rates for D1 , D2 , and D3 are all monitored to\nbe constant. The reason for observing a lower visibility\nis due to the finite size of the detector. We expect to\nachieve higher visibility by simulating ideal point detectors.\nPhenomenologically, we may name the nontrivial\nthree-photon correlation \"three-photon bunching\" because in the measurement we find that the photons do\nhave 3!-times greater chance of being jointly captured by\nD1 , D2 , and D3 simultaneously than that of being jointly\ncaptured at different time(separated by coherent time of\n\n\f3\nthe light field). However, does this observation really\nmean that three photons have 3!-times greater chance to\nbe emitted as a bunch from the thermal source? As we\nhave discussed earlier, we have difficulties following the\nphoton bunching argument when N takes a large value.\nIn the view of quantum interference, the observed\nthree-photon correlation of thermal radiation is the result of three-photon interference, which involves the nonlocal superposition of three-photon amplitudes, a nonclassical entity corresponding to different yet indistinguishable alternative ways of triggering a three-photon\njoint-detection event. The probability of observing a\nthree-photon joint-detection event is calculated from the\nGlauber theory [9]\nG(3) (t1 , t2 , t3 )\n\n(1)\n\n= \u00ca (\u2212) (t1 )\u00ca (\u2212) (t2 )\u00ca (\u2212) (t3 )\u00ca (+) (t3 )\u00ca (+) (t2 )\u00ca (+) (t1 )\nwhere h...i denotes an expectation value operation based\non the quantum state of the measured electromagnetic\nfield. Thermal radiation is typically in mixed states. The\ngeneralized density operator for a chaotic-thermal field\ncan be written as [7]\n\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\nX\n{n}\n\np{n} |{n}ih{n}|,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p{n} is the probability that the thermal field is in\nthe state\n|{n}i \u2261\n\nY\n\u03c9\n\n|n\u03c9 i = |n\u03c9 i|n\u03c9\u2032 i...|n\u03c9\u2032\u2032...\u2032 i.\n\nHere we have simplified the problem to 1-D (temporal)\nwith one polarization. The summation of Eq. (2) includes\nall possible frequency modes \u03c9, occupation numbers n\u03c9\nfor the mode \u03c9 and all possible combinations of occupation numbers for different modes in a set of {n}. The\nquantized field operator takes the following form\n\n(\u2212)\n\n\u00caj\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9 f (\u03c9) g(\u03c9, tj , zj ) \u00e2\u2020 (\u03c9),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere f (\u03c9) is the spectral distribution function of the\nfield, g(\u03c9, tj , zj ) is the Green's function which propagates\neach mode of the field from the source to the jth detector.\nAssuming equal distances between the source and the\nphotodetectors, i.e., z1 = z2 = z3 , the joint detection\n\ncounting rate of D1 , D2 , and D3 is calculated as [9]\nG(3) (t1 , t2 , t3 )\nZ\n\u221d d\u03c9 d\u03c9 \u2032 d\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 f (\u03c9)\n\n2\n\nf (\u03c9 \u2032 )\n\n2\n\nf (\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 )\n\n2\n\n1 \u0002\n\u221a g(\u03c9, t1 )g(\u03c9 \u2032 , t2 )g(\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 , t3 ) + g(\u03c9, t1 )g(\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 , t2 )g(\u03c9 \u2032 , t3 )\n6\n+ g(\u03c9 \u2032 , t1 )g(\u03c9, t2 )g(\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 , t3 ) + g(\u03c9 \u2032 , t1 )g(\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 , t2 )g(\u03c9, t3 )\n\u00032\n+ g(\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 , t1 )g(\u03c9, t2 )g(\u03c9 \u2032 , t3 ) + g(\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 , t1 )g(\u03c9 \u2032 , t2 )g(\u03c9, t3 )\nZ\n2\n2\n2\n= d\u03c9 d\u03c9 \u2032 d\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 f (\u03c9) f (\u03c9 \u2032 ) f (\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 )\n\u00032\n1 \u0002 X\n\u00d7 \u221a\ng(\u03c9, t1 )g(\u03c9 \u2032 , t2 )g(\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 , t3 ) .\n3! \u03c9,\u03c9\u2032 ,\u03c9\u2032\u2032\n\n(4)\n\nEq. (4) is the key equation to understand the threephoton interference nature of the nontrivial third-order\ncorrelation. We notice that the probability amplitude\nhas the similar form of the symmetrized wavefunction of\nthree identical particles. The six terms of superposition\nin Eq. (4) correspond to six different yet indistinguishable alternative ways for three independent photons to\ntrigger a three-fold joint-detection event (see Fig. 4). At\nt1 = t2 = t3 (under the condition of z1 = z2 = z3 ) the\nsix amplitudes are superposed constructively, and consequently G(3) (t1 , t2 , t3 ) achieves its maximum value when\nsummed over these constructive interferences. On the\nother hand, at t1 6= t2 6= t3 , the six amplitudes are\nnot superposed constructively , the cross terms equal to\nzero and consequently G(3) (t1 , t2 , t3 ) achieves lower values. It is the three-photon interference that caused the\nthree randomly distributed photons to have 6-times more\nchance of being captured at t1 = t2 = t3 than that of being captured at t1 6= t2 6= t3 .\nTo simplify the calculation, taking the spectral function f (\u03c9) a constant within the narrow bandwidth \u2206\u03c9\nof the pseudo-thermal field, the normalized third-order\ncorrelation function g (3) (t1 , t2 , t3 ) is approximately\ng (3) (t1 , t2 , t3 )\n\u2206\u03c9(t1 \u2212 t2 )\n]\n2\n\u2206\u03c9(t3 \u2212 t1 )\n\u2206\u03c9(t2 \u2212 t3 )\n] + sinc2 [\n]\n(5)\n+ sinc2 [\n2\n2\n\u2206\u03c9(t2 \u2212 t3 )\n\u2206\u03c9(t3 \u2212 t1 )\n\u2206\u03c9(t1 \u2212 t2 )\n]sinc[\n]sinc[\n].\n+ 2 sinc[\n2\n2\n2\n= 1 + sinc2 [\n\nIt is easy to see that when t1 = t2 = t3 , g (3) (t1 , t2 , t3 ) = 6,\nthe third-order correlation function achieves a maximum\ncontrast of 6 to 1 (visibility \u223c71% ). Apparently, the\nrandomly radiated independent thermal photons seem to\nhave six times greater chance of being bunched in triples\nwhen we measure them simultaneously than that if we\nmeasure when t1 6= t2 6= t3 .\nIn fact, the quantum theory of light predicts that the\nrandomly radiated independent \"thermal photons\" will\n\n\f4\na\n\nD1\n\nb\n\nD2\n\nc\n\nD3\n\na\n\nD1\n\nb\n\nc\n\nAI\na\n\nD2\n\nc\n\nD3\n\nAIV\n\nD1\n\nD2\n\nb\n\nD2\n\nD3\n\nc\n\nD3\n\nAII\nD1\n\nb\n\na\n\nis proportional to the first-order self-correlation function\nG(1) (r, t), which measures the probability of observing a\nphoto-detection event at a space-time coordinate (r, t).\nFor the experimental setup of Fig. 1,\n\nAIII\n\na\n\nD1\n\na\n\nD1\n\nb\n\nD2\n\nb\n\nD2\n\nc\n\nD3\n\nc\n\nD3\n\nAV\n\nG(1) (r, t) = h E (\u2212) (r, t)E (+) (r, t) i = constant.\n\nAVI\n\nFIG. 4: Three independent photons a, b, c have six alternative\nways of triggering a joint-detection event between detectors\nD1 , D2 , and D3 .

The photons\nare always randomly radiated from the thermal source.\nThis experiment shows a nontrivial third-order temporal correlation of chaotic-thermal light in which the randomly radiated thermal light is observed to have a 6times greater chance of being captured by three individual photodetectors simultaneously than that of being\ncaptured by the same detectors at different times (separated by the coherence time of light field).The nontrivial\nN th-order correlation of thermal light can be interpreted\nas the result of multi-photon interference, involving the\nsuperposition of multi-photon amplitudes, a nonclassical\nentity corresponding to different yet indistinguishable alternative ways of triggering a joint-detection event between multiple detectors.\nThe authors wish to thank M.H.

(6) indicates that the N th-order correlation of thermal radiation is the result of N -photon interference. It\nis easy to see that if all of the N -photon amplitudes are\nsuperposed constructively at a certain experimental condition, the thermal radiation will have N ! times greater\nchance to be measured under that experimental condition.\nAlthough we have observed the nontrivial three-photon\ncorrelation with a contrast much higher than 2 to 1, and\nexpect to have N -photon correlation with a contrast of\nN ! to 1, the quantum theory does not prevent having a\nconstant counting rate for each of the photodetectors D1 ,\nD2 , and D3 , respectively. In fact, the counting rate of D1 ,\nD2 , and D3 was monitored during the measurement and\nfound to be constant, indicating a temporal randomly\nemitted and distributed stochastic emission process in\nthe thermal source.
