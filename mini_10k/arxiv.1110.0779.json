Besides resolving the hierarchy problem, this opens the possibility that small black holes\ncould be produced by the Large Hadron Collider [3], and may form within strange stars, which\nconsist entirely of deconfined quark matter [4]. It is unlikely that such quantum black holes can\nbe described in terms of classical gravity [5]; even the notion of an event horizon is suspect due\nto potentially large curvature in the vicinity of the would-be horizon. Such a quantum black hole\ncould carry electric charge, color charge and angular momentum inherited from the partons that\ncreated it. BlackMax is a black hole event generator that can account for all gauge charges and is\nbeing used to put constraints on mini black hole production at the LHC [6, 7].\nThe black hole would interact with nearby quarks via gravity as well as color and electrical\ninteractions. However, there are two potential roadblocks for describing such a system. Firstly, the\nsemi-classical approach to gravity is unreliable when the quarks are close to the black hole. Secondly,\nthe color interaction might take place at strong coupling, in which case conventional quantum field\ntheoretic methods are ill-equipped to describe dynamical processes. We will demonstrate that the\nAdS/CFT correspondence [8\u201311] may be used to evade both of the aforementioned difficulties.\nWhile we consider the color interactions between quarks and the black hole, we will consider\na black hole with only a small amount of color charge, so that the effect of the color charge on\nthe background itself is negligible. This enables us to use a supergravity solution for which the\nfield contributions corresponding to the color charge have not been turned on. We are also making\nthe working assumption that the AdS/CFT correspondence can be applied even though there is a\nsingularity extending out to the boundary.\nThe dynamics of quarks in strongly-coupled plasmas have been studied extensively by considering open strings near a black brane that is extended along the spacetime directions of the field\ntheory; see for example [12\u201315]. In contrast, a strongly-coupled system of quarks near a black hole\ncorresponds to a supergravity background that contains a black string extending along the bulk\nradial direction, various possibilities of which have been discussed in [16\u201319]. As one might expect,\nfor both of these scenarios there are a number of similarities in the behavior of the quarks, such as\nquark energy loss and quark-antiquark screening length.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we show that a black string exhibits a nakedly\nsingular surface, which motivates us to consider a Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton. We\ndiscuss this supergravity background, as well as how to embed flavor D8-branes on it once it has\nbeen lifted to massive type IIA theory. In section 3, we discuss single-quark string configurations\non this background. In particular, we compute the rate at which a quark steadily rotating around\na color-charged black hole loses energy as a function of its mass parameter and angular velocity.\nIn section 4, we analyze the behavior of quark-antiquark string configurations and discuss features\nsuch as the quark-antiquark screening length. We discuss possible future directions in section 5. In\nthe appendix, we present various generalizations of the Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nSome Preliminaries\n\n2.1\n\nA preamble: The five-dimensional black string\n\nIn this paper, we will be focusing on the six-dimensional Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton.\nIn order to motivate the consideration of this background, we will first consider the black string.\nThe metric for a Poincar\u00e9 patch of AdS5 can be written as\nds25 =\n\nR2 2\nr2\n2\nds\n+\ndr ,\n4\nR2\nr2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere ds24 is the 4-dimensional Minkowski metric. This corresponds to the vacuum of N = 4 super\nYang-Mills theory at large N and large 't Hooft coupling. We can attempt to describe a quantum\nfield theory in the curved spacetime background of a black hole by replacing the four-dimensional\nslice by the Schwarzschild metric\n\u0001\nds24 = \u2212f dt2 + f \u22121 d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ,\n\nwhere\n\nf =1\u2212\n\n2M\n.\n\u03c1\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nThis black string is a solution to five-dimensional Einstein gravity and was considered as a toy\nmodel for a brane-world black hole [20]. There is a singularity at \u03c1 = 0 which runs all along the r\ndirection. This string-like singularity is shielded behind a horizon at \u03c1 = 2M .\nSince the geometry is asymptotically locally AdS for \u03c1 > 0, the black string would be a natural\ncandidate for describing a dual field theory in the curved spacetime background of a black hole.\nHowever, as discussed in [20], this solution contains a nakedly singular surface at r = 0. This can\nbe seen by the fact that the Kretschmann scalar\nK=\n\n40\n48M 2 R4\n+\n,\nR4\n\u03c16 r 4\n\n(2.4)\n\ndiverges at r = 0.\nWe can attempt to cover this singular surface by a horizon, by considering the following metric\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0013\n\u0001\nr4\nr4\nR2\n\u2212 1 \u2212 h4 f (\u03c1)dt2 + f (\u03c1)\u22121 d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 + 2 1 \u2212 h4\ndr 2 .\nr\nr\nr\n(2.5)\nThe Kretschmann scalar is\nds25 =\n\nr2\nR2\n\nK=\n\n72rh8\n32M 2 rh8\n48M 2 R4\n40\n+\n+\n+\n.\nR4\n\u03c16 r 4\nR4 r 8 r 6 (r 4 \u2212 rh4 )\u03c13 (\u03c1 \u2212 2M )\n\n(2.6)\n\nFor M = 0, (2.5) is the metric for the AdS black brane, for which the singular surface at r = 0 is\ncovered by a horizon at r = rh . However, for M 6= 0 the situation worsens since now the surfaces at\nr = rh as well as \u03c1 = 2M are singular. In order to avoid nakedly singular surfaces, we will consider\na Schwarzschild soliton string solution.\n3\n\n\f2.2\n\nThe six-dimensional Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton\n\nWe consider a solution to six-dimensional Einstein gravity which is closely related to the AdS\nsoliton [21], whose metric is\n\u0001 R2 \u22121 2\nb5\nr2\n2\n2\nhdy\n+\nds\nh\ndr\n,\nh\n=\n1\n\u2212\n,\n(2.7)\n+\n4\nR2\nr2\nr5\nwhere the y direction is circular and corresponds to a large extra dimension. This is related\nby a double Wick rotation to the planar Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. Although we consider the\nsimplest scenario in which there is a single extra dimension, this is readily generalized to an arbitrary\nnumber of flat extra dimensions. Also, evidence for the existence of a class of generalizations of the\nAdS soliton with the circle S 1 replaced by a sphere S m was presented in [22]. For the AdS soliton,\nds24 is the Minkowski metric. A Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton [16] can be constructed by\nsimply replacing ds24 with the Schwarzschild metric (2.2).\nThere is a singularity at \u03c1 = 0 which runs all along the r direction and is shielded by a horizon\nat \u03c1 = 2M . For vanishing b there is a nakedly singular surface at r = 0, as depicted in the left\npicture of Figure 1. This is avoided by restricting the range of the radial coordinate to be r \u2265 b > 0.\nAs depicted in the right picture of Figure 1, the S 1 smoothly caps off like a cigar geometry at r = b,\nprovided that the coordinate y has a periodicity of \u2206y = 4\u03c0R2 /(5b). The Schwarzschild-black\nstring AdS soliton has a geometry that is asymptotically locally AdS6 . Thus, as we will discuss in\nmore detail, this is conjectured to describe a strongly-coupled field theory near a black hole, with\none extra dimension.\nds26 =\n\nr\n\nr\n\nSingular line shielded by horizon\nNakedly singular surface\n\n\u03c1\n\nr=b\n\nFigure 1: The left picture depicts the b = 0 limit of the Schwarzschild-black AdS soliton, for which\nthere is a nakedly singular surface at r = 0. The right picture shows that it acquires a smooth\ncigar-like geometry for b > 0. In each case, a probe D-brane is denoted by the turquoise surface.\nLet us now examine the regime of validity of the classical supergravity background. The\nKretschmann scalar is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n20b10 4M 2 R8\n12\n,\n(2.8)\nK = 4 5 + 10 +\nR\nr\n\u03c16 r 4\nwhich is small as long as\nR \u226b 1,\n\n\u0012 \u00132/3\nR\n\u03c1\u226bM\n.\nr\n4\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fCompare this to the perspective of the four-dimensional field theory, for which the black hole\nbackground has small curvature for \u03c1 \u226b M . Thus, at an energy scale r > R, the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence enables us to probe regions closer to the black hole than could be done by using\nthe semi-classical approach directly with the four-dimensional theory.\nThe above six-dimensional background can be embedded within massive type IIA theory [23]\nin ten dimensions by using the Kaluza-Klein reduction given in [24]. The ten-dimensional metric is\n\u0001\nds210 = s\u22121/3 ds26 + g\u22122 (d\u03b12 + c2 d\u03a923 ) ,\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere s = sin \u03b1, c = cos \u03b1 and the gauge coupling constant g is related to the mass parameter m\n\u221a\nof the massive Type IIA theory by m = 2g/3. Since we will use this as the background geometry\nin the string action, we have expressed the metric in the string frame. This is a warped product of\nthe six-dimensional space and a hemisphere of S 4 . The warp factor is singular at the boundary at\n\u03b1 = 0 and the string coupling diverges there since e\u03a6 = s\u22125/6 .\nIn the limit in which M = 0, b = 0 and the y-direction is extended, the above background\nreduces to a warped product of AdS6 and a hemisphere of S 4 . This arises in the near-horizon limit\nof a localized D4-D8 brane configuration [25] and has been conjectured in [26, 27] to be dual to a\nfive-dimensional N = 2 superconformal theory discussed in [28, 29]. Turning on the parameter b\ncorresponds to putting in an \"infra-red floor\" for the field theory. The y-direction can be made\nto be compact so that the theory lives on Mink4 \u00d7 S 1 with supersymmetry breaking boundary\nconditions imposed along the S 1 [21]. Finally, turning on the parameter M corresponds to this\nfield theory living on the background of a Schwarzschild black hole.\n\n2.3\n\nEmbedding Flavor D8-Branes\n\nThe DBI action for a D8-brane is given by\nSD8 = \u2212T8\n\nZ\n\nd9 \u03c3 e\u2212\u03a6\n\np\n\n\u2212det(gab ),\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere gab = GM N \u2202a X M \u2202b X N is the induced metric on the worldvolume of the D8-brane with\nworldsheet coordinates \u03c3 a . GM N is the ten-dimensional metric with \u2202a = \u2202/\u2202\u03c3 a . We would like\nto consider the shape of the D8-branes as a function of r on the metric (2.10) which describes the\nten-dimensional lift of the Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton.\nWe can consider an embedding in which the D8-branes extend in four-dimensional spacetime,\nare wrapped on the internal 4-sphere, and form a curve for slicings of constant \u03c1 described by the\nfunction r(y, \u03c1, \u03b1).

While there\nis a \"trivial\" solution with r0 = 0 which represents disjoint D8-branes, the curved solution is the\nenergetically favored one.\n\n3\n\nSingle-Quark String Configurations\n\nThe dynamics of a classical string are governed by the Nambu-Goto action\nZ\np\n1\n2\n\u2212det(gab ) ,\nd\n\u03c3\nS=\u2212\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere gab = GM N \u2202a X M \u2202b X N is the induced metric on the string worldsheet. We will consider\nstrings on the background described by the ten-dimensional metric (2.10), which move purely in\nthe six-dimensional space and lie at a point on the 4-sphere. In fact, it can be shown that the\nequations of motion require the string to lie at the \"north pole\" of the 4-sphere at \u03b1 = \u2212\u03c0/2. This\nis the result of an effective gravitational repulsion on the string that is due to the warp factor.\nThus, X M run over the six coordinates t, \u03c1, \u03b8, \u03c6, y, r. Since \u03b1\u2032 can be canceled out in the action\nanyway by using the radial coordinate u = r/\u03b1\u2032 , we set \u03b1\u2032 = 1\nFor a single-quark string configuration, an endpoint lies on a probe D-brane and the string\ngoes through the horizon at \u03c1 = 2M and approaches the singularity at \u03c1 = 0, as is schematically\ndepicted in the left picture of Figure 2. Due to the spherical symmetry of the four-dimensional\nspacetime, a static string configuration lives within the r \u2212 \u03c1 plane. However, we will consider a\nstring that is steadily moving in the \u03c6, for which we will allow for the possibility that the string\nspirals around the \u03c6 direction as well. This string configuration can be described by the worldsheet\nembedding\n\u03c0\nt = \u03c4,\n\u03c1 = \u03c3,\n\u03b8= ,\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(\u03c3) + \u03c9\u03c4,\nr = r(\u03c3),\n(3.2)\n2\n6\n\n\fwith the boundary conditions\n0 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 T,\n\n0 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 \u03c1\u0304,\n\nr(\u03c1\u0304) = r\u0304,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere the endpoint of the string is located at r = r\u0304 and \u03c1 = \u03c1\u0304. \u03c9 and v = \u03c1\u0304\u03c9 are respectively the\nangular velocity and velocity of the string endpoint measured by an observer far from the black\nhole. On the other hand, the proper velocity V of the string endpoint is given by V = vf \u22121/2 |\u03c1=\u03c1\u0304 .\nThus, in order for the string to be timelike, we must have V < 1 which translates into\ns\n2M\nv < 1\u2212\n.\n(3.4)\n\u03c1\u0304\nWith the above worldsheet embedding, the action becomes\ns\n\u0013\n\u0012 4\nZ\nr 4 2 \u20322\nr \u22121\nT\n\u22121 r \u20322 +\nf\n+\nh\nf\u03c1 \u03c6 ,\nd\u03c1 (f \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u03c12 )\nS=\u2212\n4\n2\u03c0\nR\nR4\nwhere \u2032 \u2261 \u2202/\u2202\u03c1.

In particular, c = 0 corresponds to a string that lives solely in the r \u2212 \u03c1 plane.\nThe canonical momentum densities associated to the string are given by\n\u03c0\u03bc0 = \u2212h\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c0\u03bc1 = \u2212h\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(\u1e8a * X \u2032 )(X \u03bd )\u2032 \u2212 (X \u2032 )2 (\u1e8a \u03bd )\n\u221a\n,\n2\u03c0 \u2212G\n(\u1e8a * X \u2032 )(\u1e8a \u03bd ) \u2212 (\u1e8a)2 (X \u03bd )\u2032\n\u221a\n.\n2\u03c0 \u2212G\n\nThe total energy and momentum in the \u03c6 direction of the string are\nZ\nZ\nE = \u2212 d\u03c3 \u03c0t0 ,\np\u03c6 = d\u03c3 \u03c0x0 .\n\n(3.9)\n\n(3.10)\n\nThe string will gain energy through its endpoint at a rate of\n\u03c0t1 =\n\n\u03c9c\n.\n2\u03c0R2\n7\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fThe string exerts a force on its endpoint, which must be countered by an external force. For a\npurely radial string, the external force must be radially outwards. If the string spirals around the\n\u03c6 direction, then we also need to apply a force in the \u03c6 direction given by\n\u03c0\u03c61 =\n\nc\n.\n2\u03c0R2\n\n(3.12)\n\nFrom the four-dimensional gravity perspective this is rather surprising, given that the quark is\norbiting the black hole at a constant speed and the black hole is not rotating. However, this is a\nresult of the strong interaction between the quark and the black hole.\nFrom (3.7) and (3.8), we find\n\u0012\n\u0013\nf \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u03c12\n\u03c12 r 4\n1\n= 4\n(r 4 + R4 f h\u22121 r \u20322 ),\n\u2212G =\nR4 A2\nR\nr 4 f \u03c12 \u2212 c2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc2\nf \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u03c12\n\u20322\n\u03c6\n= 4 2 2\n(r 4 + R4 f h\u22121 r \u20322 ).\n(3.13)\nr f \u03c1\nr 4 f \u03c12 \u2212 c2\nIn order to have a well-defined string and avoid parts of it moving faster than the local speed of\nlight, \u2212G must be positive definite all along the string. For nonzero c, this implies that \u03c6\u20322 > 0.\nThus, the string spirals around the \u03c6 direction as it approaches the black hole, without reversing\ndirection.\nIn order for \u2212G > 0, any real roots of the numerator of \u2212G that lie along the string must also\nbe roots of its denominator. Consider the function\nF \u2261 f \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u03c12 .\n\n(3.14)\n\nIf there is a point \u03c1 = \u03c1crit \u2264 \u03c1\u0304 on the string such that F (\u03c1crit ) = 0, then this must specify the\nvalue of c via\n4\n(3.15)\nrcrit\nfcrit\u03c12crit \u2212 c2 = 0,\nwhere rcrit \u2261 r(\u03c1crit ) and fcrit \u2261 f (\u03c1crit ). Since rcrit depends on c, the specified value of c must be\nfound numerically. On the other hand, if \u03c1crit > \u03c1\u0304, then c is unspecified. In this case, given initial\nconditions with a nonvanishing value of c, the string will presumably evolve to the minimum-energy\nconfiguration with c = 0.\n\n3.1\n\nStatic strings\n\nLet us first consider a static string with \u03c9 = 0. If the endpoint lies outside of the horizon (\u03c1\u0304 > 2M )\nthen, in order to have a well-defined string outside and on the horizon, we must have c = 0. For\nthe numerical integration, we take the boundary conditions to be at an intermediary point on the\nstring \u03c1 = \u03c10 and r(\u03c10 ) = r0 . Taking \u03c10 = 2 corresponds to a string which extends through the\nhorizon, although the string endpoint is of course only sensitive to the portion of the string that\nlies outside of the horizon. In order to do the numerical integration, we have taken \u03c10 = 2 + 10\u22128\nfor the region outside the horizon and then matched this with the region inside the horizon for\n\u03c10 = 2 \u2212 10\u22128 . The numerical result for \u03c1\u0304 = 2.05 and R = M = b = 1 is given in the right plot\n8\n\n\fSchematic depiction\n\nr\n2\n\nNumerical results\n\u03c1\u0304 = 2.05; R = M = b = 1\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u03a1\n\nFigure 2: The picture on the left is a schematic depiction of the string configuration corresponding\nto a quark interacting with a color-charged black hole. The corresponding numerical plot is shown\non the right.\nof Figure 2. Note that this plot is no longer reliable as one gets too close to \u03c1 = 0. Of course, the\nstring endpoint is only sensitive to the portion of the string that lies outside of the horizon.\nThe left plot of Figure 3 shows the portion of this string configuration within the horizon, from\nwhich we see that it undulates in the r direction. This is a feature associated with the nonvanishing\nb parameter of the AdS soliton. This is demonstrated by the right plot in Figure 3, for which we\ntake b = 0 and find the curve of the string to be monotonic in r. The field theory interpretation of\nthese undulations could be that the interaction between the quark and the color charge of the black\nhole excites a collective gluonic resonance. Note however that this excitation is located within the\nevent horizon and therefore cannot be detected by observers outside of the black hole.\nr\n\nr\n\n1.2\n1.1\n\n1\n1.08\n\n0.8\n\n1.06\n\n0.6\n\n1.04\n\n0.4\n\n1.02\n\n0.2\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u03a1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n\u03a1\n\nFigure 3: The string extending through the horizon for b = 1 (left) and b = 0 (right).\nIf the string endpoint lies within the horizon (\u03c1\u0304 < 2M ), then this corresponds to a quark that\nis located within the event horizon of the black hole. Interestingly enough, in this case the point\n\u03c1 = \u03c1c does not lie on the string. This means that the string is well-defined for arbitrary values of\nc, which corresponds to a string curving into the \u03c6 direction as it approaches the singularity. This\nis shown in Figure 4 for the parameter values of b = c = 1 for a string with an endpoint that lies\njust within the horizon at \u03c1\u0304 = 1.99 and at r0 = 3. Note that we are using the Cartesian coordinates\n9\n\n\fx = \u03c1 cos \u03c6 and y = \u03c1 sin \u03c6.\ny\n0.80\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\nx\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n3\n\n2.5\n2\n\n2\n\nr\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\nFigure 4: A static string which lies entirely within the horizon and curves in the \u03c6 direction for\nb = c = 1 and \u03c1\u0304 = 1.99.\n\n3.2\n\nSteadily-rotating strings\n\nNow we will consider steadily-rotating strings. The constraints on c can be determined from the\nroots of (3.14), which is a cubic function of \u03c1. The discriminant is\n\u2206 = 4\u03c9 2 (1 \u2212 27M 2 \u03c9 2 ).\n\n(3.16)\n\n\u221a\nFor \u03c9 > \u03c91 \u2261 1/( 27M ), \u2206 < 0 and there is one real root and two nonreal complex conjugate\nroots. Since F (\u03c1 \u2192 \u2212\u221e) \u2192 \u2212\u221e and F (\u03c1 \u2192 0\u2212 ) \u2192 +\u221e, there is always a real negative root.\nThus, there are no physical roots of F for \u03c9 > \u03c91 . Then in order for the denominator of \u2212G\nto never vanish, we must have the lower bound c2 \u2265 c2min , where cmin satisfies (3.15). Note that\ncmin 6= 0 if the string endpoint is on or outside of the horizon, while cmin = 0 if the endpoint lies\nwithin. In other words, for the case in which the string endpoint is outside of the horizon and\nmoving at a high speed, there is a minimal amount with which the string must spiral around the\n\u03c6 direction.\nFor \u03c9 \u2264 \u03c91 , (3.14) has three real roots, which are all distinct for \u03c9 < \u03c91 (\u2206 > 0) and two\nof which coincide for \u03c9 = \u03c91 (\u2206 = 0). In particular, in addition to the real negative root, there\nare two real positive roots which lie outside of the horizon for \u03c9 > 0. If one of them lies within\nthe region 2M < \u03c1crit \u2264 \u03c1\u0304, then this specifies the value of c via (3.15). From (3.14), we see that\np\nthis occurs for \u03c9 \u2264 \u03c92 \u2261 1 \u2212 2M/\u03c1\u0304. On the other hand, for \u03c9 > \u03c92 , then we must have the\nlower bound c2 > c2min . Note that the threshold velocity vanishes for quarks at the horizon and\napproaches the speed of light for quarks far from the black hole.\nTo summarize, for a string endpoint moving with angular velocity \u03c9 whose endpoint lies outside\nof the horizon, the value of c is specified for \u03c9 \u2264 Min(\u03c91 , \u03c92 ) while we have the lower bound\n10\n\n\fc2 > c2min for \u03c9 > Min(\u03c91 , \u03c92 ), where Min(\u03c91 , \u03c92 ) is the minimum quantity between \u03c91 and \u03c92 .\nOn the other hand, if the endpoint lies within the horizon, then the value of c can be arbitrary.\nFigure 5 shows a steadily-rotating, spiralling string whose endpoint lies outside of the horizon\nat \u03c1\u0304 = 2.02 and is moving at \u03c9 = 0.5. We have taken the parameters R = M = b = c = 1. Since\n\u03c9 > Min(\u03c91 , \u03c92 ) \u2248 0.1, c must satisfy c2 > c2min , which can be confirmed numerically. We have\nmatched the solution outside of the horizon with \u03c10 = 2.0005 and r0 = 3 to the solution within\nthe horizon with \u03c10 = 1.991 and r0 = 3. Spiralling strings near a black brane extended along the\nspacetime directions of the field theory have been considered in [30] and in AdS5 in [31\u201334].\n\n3\n2.5\nr\n\n2\n1.5\n2\n\n1\n-1\n\n1.5\n1\n\n0\nx\n\ny\n\n0.5\n\n1\n2 0\n\nFigure 5: A steadily-rotating, spiralling string for \u03c9 = 0.5, b = c = 1 and \u03c1\u0304 = 2.02.\nAs a quark circles around the black hole it loses energy, which is analogous to the energy loss\nof a quark moving in a strongly-coupled plasma [13]. We have numerically computed the rate of\nenergy loss as a function of the angular velocity \u03c9 for various values of the mass parameter \u03c1\u0304, as\nshown in Figure 6. We used the shooting method in order to find the value of c for a given \u03c9 that\nenforces the boundary condition r(\u03c1\u0304) = r\u0304.

It can\nbe seen that the midsection of the string is pulled towards the horizon, which is associated with a\nmodification of the quark-antiquark potential due to the presence of the black hole.\nr\n2\n1.9\n1.8\n1.7\n1.6\n1.5\n1.4\n\n2.01\n\n2.02\n\n2.03\n\n2.04\n\n2.05\n\n\u03a1\n\nFigure 7: A quark-antiquark string configuration with endpoints separated in the radial direction.\n\n4.2\n\nStatic strings with endpoints separated in tangential direction\n\nA quark-antiquark pair separated along the \u03c6 direction can be described by the worldsheet embedding\n\u03c0\nt = \u03c4,\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(\u03c3),\n\u03b8= ,\n\u03c6 = \u03c3,\nr = r(\u03c3),\n(4.3)\n2\n\n12\n\n\fwith the boundary conditions\n0 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 T,\n\n\u2212\u03c6\u03041 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 \u03c6\u03042 ,\n\nr(\u03c6\u03041 ) = r(\u03c6\u03042 ) = r\u0304,\n\n\u03c1(\u03c6\u03041 ) = \u03c1(\u03c6\u03042 ) = \u03c1\u0304.\n\n(4.4)\n\nThen the action becomes\nT\nS=\u2212\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nr\n\nd\u03c6 \u03c12\n\nr4\nr 4 \u20322\n\u22121 r \u20322 +\nf\n+\nf\nh\n\u03c1 ,\nR4\nR4\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere now \u2032 = \u2202\u03c6 .

The first relation implies that the midsection of the string dips\ndown. The second relation tells us that the midsection of the string dips towards the singularity\nat \u03c1 = 0 for \u03c10 > M and away from the singularity for \u03c10 < M . A qualitative depiction of a string\nwith one turning point is given by the left picture in Figure 8, in which the bending of the string in\nthe \u03c1 direction has been exaggerated. In reality, the bending of the string in the \u03c1 direction tends\nto occur at about two orders of magnitude less than the scale at which the string dips down in the\nr direction. The two numerical plots in Figure 9 show the dependence of the r and \u03c1 coordinates\non \u03c6 for a string with \u03c10 = 2.01.\nIf the distance between the string endpoints is increased, then at some point the energetically\nfavorable configuration is that of two disconnected strings, which is schematically depicted in the\nright picture in Figure 8. This is analogous to the screening length exhibited by a quark-antiquark\n\n13\n\n\fSchematic depictions\n\nFigure 8: Qualitative depictions of quark-antiquark string configurations whose endpoints are separated along the tangential direction for separation distance less than (left picture) and greater\nthan (right picture) the screening length.\n+\n\n\u03a1\n\n*\n\n&#\"&\n\n&#)\n\n&#\"$)\n\n!\"#$\n\n!\"#\"%\n\n&#\"$(\n\n&#(\n\n&#\"$'\n\n&#'\n\n&#\"$&\n\n&#&\n\n\"#\"%\n\n\"#$\n\n\u03a6\n\n!\"#$\n\n!\"#\"%\n\n\"#\"%\n\n\"#$\n\n\u03a6\n\nFigure 9: The r and \u03c1 coordinates as a function of angle \u03c6 for a quark-antiquark string configuration\nwhose endpoints are separated along the tangential direction.\npair in a strongly-coupled plasma [35, 36], except in this case the quark-antiquark interaction is\nscreened by the black hole.\nThere can be additional points along the string which are turning points in either the r or \u03c1\ndirections. For instance, substituting (4.8) into the first equation in (4.6) for r \u2032 = 0 yields\nr \u2032\u2032 =\n\n2\u03c14 r 7 f h\n.\nR4 \u03c120 r04 f0\n\n(4.11)\n\nThis implies that the string dips down (up) in the vicinity of this r turning point if it is located\non the same (opposite) side of the horizon as the midpoint of the string. On the other hand,\nsubstituting (4.8) into the second equation in (4.6) for \u03c1\u2032 = 0 gives\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u03c1r 4\nf \u03c1,\n(4.12)\n\u03c1\u2032\u2032 = 1 + M\n\u03c120 r04 f0\nthereby determining the regions in the r \u2212 \u03c1 plane for which the string curves away or towards\n\u03c1 = 0 in the vicinity of this \u03c1 turning point.\n14\n\n\fThe behavior of the string is rather sensitive to its location within the r \u2212 \u03c1 plane. For instance,\nby changing the midsection turning point to be at r0 = 1 and \u03c10 = 1.99, we find that there is a\nstring configuration whose endpoints lie outside of the horizon and whose midsection lies inside of\nthe horizon, as shown in the right plot of Figure 10. The string exhibits saddlepoints on either\nside of its midsection where it then dips into the horizon. These saddlepoints occur since \u03c1\u2032\u2032 = 0\nat the horizon, as indicated by (4.12). From the left plot, of Figure 10 we see that the string\nlies above the endpoints in the r direction, for which the two peaks occur outside of the horizon.\nSince the midsection of the string dips behind the horizon, the corresponding quark and antiquark\nis in some sense in an intermediate state between a bound quark-antiquark pair and that of free\nquarks. The peaks in the string on either side of its midsection could correspond to excitations of\nthe quark potential due to the presence of the black hole, which serve to keep the quark-antiquark\npair together.\n\u03a1\n\nr\n1.3\n\n2.025\n\n1.25\n\n2.02\n1.2\n\n2.015\n\n1.15\n\n2.01\n\n1.1\n\n2.005\n\n1.05\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1.995\n\n0.95\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.2\n\n1.99\n\n\u03a6\n\n0.4\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03a6\n\nFigure 10: The coordinates r (left) and \u03c1 (right) for a quark-antiquark string configuration whose\nendpoints are outside the horizon and whose midsection lies within the horizon.\n\n4.3\n\nSteadily-rotating strings\n\nWe will consider a quark-antiquark pair separated and steadily rotating in the \u03c6 direction.

In particular, the midsection of a string located outside of the\nhorizon and moving with an angular velocity of \u03c9 < \u03c9crit (\u03c9 > \u03c9crit ) bends towards (away from)\n\u221a\nr = 0 and \u03c1 = 0, where \u03c9crit = f0 /\u03c10 .\nAs with static strings, there can be additional points which are turning points in either the r or\n\u03c1 directions. To find a turning point in the r direction, we substitute (4.17) into the first equation\nin (4.15) for r \u2032 = 0.

We show\nthat quarks that interact strongly with a color-charged black hole share a number of the same\nfeatures as quarks in a strongly-coupled plasma, such as quark energy loss and a quark-antiquark\nscreening length.\nThere are a number of potentially useful and interesting future directions. Firstly, the stability\nof the Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton still needs to be investigated. The AdS soliton has\nbeen shown to be perturbatively stable, its mass is lower than that of AdS itself and, moreover, there\nis evidence that it is the lowest energy state for particular boundary conditions [37, 38]. However,\nby no means does this indicate that the Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton itself is stable.\n16\n\n\fIt would be nice to extend our considerations to include the behavior of open strings on the\ngeneralizations of the Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton that are discussed in the appendix,\nsuch as the one that describes the a strongly-coupled field theory near a rotating black hole.\nIt would also be useful to consider color-charged black holes in a strongly-coupled plasma. A\nblack hole in a strongly-coupled plasma has been conjectured to be dual to a \"black droplet\" or\na \"black funnel\", depending on whether the plasma interacts weakly or strongly with the black\nhole, respectively [16\u201318]. Examples of these types of gravity backgrounds have been constructed\nin [17, 19].\nLastly, the AdS/CFT correspondence could enable us to probe the final stages of black hole\nevaporation to a greater extent than has been done with the semi-classical approach in four dimensions.\n\nA\n\nA.1\n\nVarious generalizations of the Schwarzschild-black string AdS\nsoliton\nKerr-black string AdS soliton\n\nA rotating generalization of the Schwarzschild-black string AdS soliton consists of taking ds24 to be\nthe Kerr metric, which can be written as\nds24 = \u2212\n\n\u039b \u2212 a2 sin2 \u03b8 2 \u03c1\u03032\n\u03bb sin2 \u03b8\n4M a\u03c1 sin2 \u03b8\n2\n2 2\n2\ndt\n+\nd\u03c1\n+\n\u03c1\u0303\nd\u03b8\n+\nd\u03c6\n+\ndtd\u03c6,\n\u03c1\u03032\n\u039b\n\u03c1\u03032\n\u03c1\u03032\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere\n\u039b = \u03c12 \u2212 2M \u03c1 + a2 ,\n\n\u03bb = (\u03c12 + a2 )2 \u2212 a2 \u039b sin2 \u03b8,\n\n\u03c1\u03032 = \u03c12 + a2 cos2 \u03b8.\n\nIn this case, the Kretschmann scalar is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n12\n20b10\nK =\n5\n+\nR4\nr 10\n\u0002\n\u0003\n12M 2 R4 2\n(\u03c1 \u2212 a2 cos2 \u03b8) 4\u03c14 \u2212 28a2 \u03c12 + a4 + a2 cos 2\u03b8(2\u03c1\u03032 \u2212 30\u03c12 + a2 ) ,\n+\n6\n4\n\u03c1\u0303 r\n\n(A.2)\n\n(A.3)\n\nfrom which we see that the geometry is smooth everywhere except at \u03c1\u0303 = 0, which corresponds to\nthe usual ring singularity of the Kerr black hole.\n\nA.2\n\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter-black string AdS soliton\n\nA solution whose constant-radius slices contains the four-dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric\nis given by\nr2\nds26 = h\u0303 dy 2 + 2 ds24 + h\u0303\u22121 dr 2 ,\nL\n17\n\n\fwhere\n\nb3\nr2\n\u2212\n,\nR2 r 3\nwhere the de Sitter black hole metric can be written as (2.2) with f now given by\nh\u0303 = 1 +\n\nf =1\u2212\n\n2M\n\u03c12\n\u2212 2.\n\u03c1\nL\n\n(A.4)\n\n(A.5)\n\nThe Kretschmann scalar is given by\nK=\n\n240b6\n48L4 M 2\n60\n+ 10 +\n.\n4\nR\nr\nr 4 \u03c16\n\n(A.6)\n\nThe solution is free of conical singularities if the coordinate y has a periodicity of\n\u2206y =\n\n4\u03c0R2 c4\n,\n2c5 + 3b3 R2\n\n(A.7)\n\nwhere c is the largest root of the function h\u0303.\n\nA.3\n\nIn six-dimensional gauged supergravity\n\nThe six-dimensional gauged supergravity constructed in [39] has a solution which describes a black\nstring AdS soliton supported by a single component of the SU (2) Yang-Mills fields.
