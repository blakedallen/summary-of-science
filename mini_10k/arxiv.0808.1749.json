However,\nLefschetz's pairing does not provide an algebra structure on C\u2217 (M), itself, as two chains\nmay only be intersected if they are in general position. This difficulty does not descend to\nthe homology groups since any pair of cycles are homologous to cycles in general position,\nand the resulting intersection product turns out to be independent of the choices made while\nputting chains into general position. This approach to pairings and duality was supplanted\n1\n\n\feventually in manifold theory by the more versatile cup product algebra, but it gained\nnew relevance with the work of Goresky and MacPherson on intersection homology on PL\npseudomanifolds (a class of spaces including complex varieties) in [12] and is also related to\nthe work of Chas and Sullivan on string topology [5] (see [19]).\nNearly 80 years after Lefschetz, James McClure [20] has shown that the domain for the\nintersection pairing on C\u2217 (M) is in fact a full subcomplex of C\u2217 (M)\u2297C\u2217 (M). In other words,\nthe subcomplex G2 \u2282 C\u2217 (M) \u2297 C\u2217 (M) on which the intersection product of chains is welldefined is quasi-isomorphic to C\u2217 (M) \u2297 C\u2217 (M).1 In fact, McClure goes further to show that\nC\u2217 (M), together with the chain intersection pairing, has the structure of a partially-defined\ncommutative DGA and is thus quasi-isomorphic to an E\u221e chain algebra. McClure's goal in\ndoing so was to develop tools to study the Chas-Sullivan operations in string topology.\nWith different purposes in mind, our first goal in this paper is to generalize McClure's\nresult to the intersection pairing of intersection chain complexes on PL pseudomanifolds. In\nother words, we prove that the domain G2 of definition of the intersection pairing on an\noriented PL pseudomanifold X is a full subcomplex of C\u2217 (X) \u2297 C\u2217 (X), and, as a corollary,\nthat the domain of the Goresky-MacPherson intersection pairing from I p\u0304 C\u2217 (X)\u2297I q\u0304 C\u2217 (X) to\nC\u2217 (X) (or to I r\u0304 C\u2217 (X), when r\u0304 \u2265 p\u0304 + q\u0304) is a full subcomplex of I p\u0304 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 I q\u0304 C\u2217 (X). We then\ngo on to show that the intersection pairing of intersection chains on a PL pseudomanifold\npossesses the structure of a partial restricted algebra, in a sense to be made precise below.\nAlthough the first part of this may seem to be a straightforward generalization of McClure's\nresults (and we do, in fact, utilize McClure's superstructure), some of the details of McClure's\nproof use arguments that rely strongly on the manifold structure of the spaces involved (in\nparticular, McClure's proof rests on being able to cover his manifolds by Euclidean balls\nand then working with general position arguments within these balls) and thus fail to work\non stratified spaces. So, we must turn to alternate arguments that employ a generalization\nof McCrory's results on stratified general position [21] instead. Since PL manifolds are\nspecial cases of PL pseudomanifolds, our arguments include an alternative proof of McClure's\ntheorem.\nThis program is carried out in Sections 3, 4, and 5, below. In the first of these sections, we\nare concerned principally with general position issues and showing that the (appropriately\nshifted) chain complex C\u2217 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 C\u2217 (X) contains a quasi-isomorphic subcomplex Gk\nconsisting of chains in stratified general position and whose boundaries are in stratified\ngeneral position. We note here the important fact (in a certain sense the essence of the\nP\nwhole matter) that such chains cannot in general be written as sums C = Ci1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Cik\nin which each collection Ci1 , . . . , Cik is in stratified stratified general position and has its\nboundary in stratified general position. This is completely analogous to the fact noted in\n[20] that a cycle C might not be expressible as a sum of cycles of this form. In general, there\nwill be important canceling of boundary terms. See below for a more technical, and hence\nmore accurate, description, culminating in the statement of Theorem 3.5. Similarly, we find\na quasi-isomorphic subcomplex of the (appropriately shifted) tensor product of intersection\n1\n\nIn order to be completely correct, this statement should incorporate some indexing shifts, which we leave\nout here in order not to clutter the introduction with too many technicalities; see Section 3 for the correct\nstatements.\n\n2\n\n\fchain complexes I p\u03041 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 I p\u0304k C\u2217 (X) that satisfies the appropriate stratified general\nposition requirements; see Theorem 3.7.\nIn Section 4, we define an intersection chain multi-product, patterned after McClure's\n(which in turn relies on earlier prescriptions by Dold and others), whose domain is the\nsubcomplex of the tensor product of intersection chains that is constructed in Section 3.\nWe then show that this product restricts to the iteration of the PL intersection product of\nGoresky and MacPherson [12] in the special case of k-tuples of chains whose tensor product\nlies in the domain (in general, not all chains in the domain can be written as sums of chains\nof this form).\nSection 5 is concerned with the partial restricted algebra structure possessed by the\nintersection chain complexes. We will describe this idea more fully in a moment.\nIn Section 6 (which is independent of Section 5), as a first application of this circle\nof ideas, we demonstrate that the sheaf theoretic intersection homology product defined\nby Goresky-MacPherson in [13] (see also [2, Section V.9]) using abstract properties of the\nderived category of sheaves is equal on PL pseudomanifolds to that defined in [12] using the\ngeometric intersection pairing. While this result generally seems to be well-believed in the\nliterature, we have not been able to pinpoint a prior proof. In addition, this approach has the\nbenefit of providing a very concrete \"roof of maps\" in the category of complexes of sheaves\nL\n\non X that serves as a realization of the pairing morphism in MorDb (X) (I p\u0304 C \u2217 \u2297 I q\u0304 C \u2217 , I r\u0304 C \u2217 ).\nA categorical structure. The material of Section 5 places our results on domains of\ngeometric intersection pairings into more categorical terms. This framework is due initially\nto Jim McClure and was refined by Mark Hovey. We provide some heuristics and motivations\nhere; more precise details can be found below in Section 5.\nFix a number n and consider classical perversities for dimension n, i.e. functions p\u0304 :\n{2, 3, . . . , n} \u2192 Z+ such that p\u0304(2) = 0 and p\u0304(j) \u2264 p\u0304(j + 1) \u2264 p\u0304(j) + 1. Define p\u0304 \u2264 q\u0304 if\np\u0304(j) \u2264 q\u0304(j) for all j. This makes the set of perversities into a poset, which we denote by P.\nBy a perverse chain complex, we mean a functor from P to the category of chain complexes. An example of a perverse chain complex is the collection of intersection chain complexes {I \u22c6 C\u2217 (Y )} for an n-dimensional stratified space Y , where \u22c6 indexes the poset of\nperversities.\nOne then expects to define restricted chain algebras that encompass product maps of the\nform\nD\u2217p\u0304 \u2297 D\u2217q\u0304 \u2192 D\u2217r\u0304\nthat are defined when p\u0304 + q\u0304 \u2264 r\u0304, are compatible with the boundary maps, and satisfy evident\nnaturality, associativity, commutativity, and unital axioms. The term \"restricted\" refers to\nthe fact that the product is only defined for pairs of perversities with p\u0304 + q\u0304 less than or equal\nto the top perversity.\nTo accomplish this precisely requires a more formal setting, which has been worked out\nby Hovey [14]. One defines a symmetric monoidal product on the category of perverse chain\ncomplexes by letting\n{D\u2217\u22c6 } \u22a0 {E\u2217\u22c6 }\n3\n\n\fbe the perverse chain complex that in perversity r\u0304 is\nlim D\u2217p\u0304 \u2297 E\u2217q\u0304 .\n\u2212\u2192\n\np\u0304+q\u0304\u2264r\u0304\n\nThen a restricted chain algebra should be a commutative monoid in the resulting symmetric\nmonoidal category.\nAn example of a restricted chain algebra is that induced on the collection of shifted\nintersection homology groups {S \u2212n I \u22c6 H\u2217 (Y )} for a stratified space Y , considered as chain\ncomplexes with zero differential, with the product defined by (direct limits of ) the GoreskyMacPherson intersection product defined in [12].\nOn the other hand, the collection {S \u2212n I \u22c6 C\u2217 (Y )} of shifted intersection chain complexes\nis not a restricted chain algebra because the chain-level intersection pairing is only defined\nfor pairs of chains that are in general position.\nLet us say that a subobject of a perverse chain complex is dense (or full ) if the inclusion\nmap is a quasi-isomorphism for each p\u0304.\nBy a partial restricted chain algebra, we mean a perverse chain complex {D\u2217\u22c6 } together\nwith, for each k, a product defined on a dense subobject of {D\u2217\u22c6 }\u22a0k ; these partially-defined\nproducts are required to have properties that are similar to the definition of commutative\nhomotopy algebras in [18] (see also [20, Section 9]). We will define these objects more\ncarefully below in Section 5 under the title of Leinster partial restricted commutative DGAs.\nIn this language, our main theorem can be stated as follows. A more detailed explanation\nof the meaning of this theorem can be found in Section 5.\nTheorem 1.1. For any compact oriented PL stratified pseudomanifold Y , the partiallydefined intersection pairing on the perverse chain complex {S \u2212n I \u22c6 C\u2217 (Y )} extends to the\nstructure of a Leinster partial restricted commutative DGA.\nNote that this partial chain algebra structure does not violate Steenrod's obstructions to\nthe commutative cochain problem, since those obstructions apply only to everywhere-defined\nalgebraic structures, not to partial algebraic structures.\nFuture applications. James McClure, Scott O. Wilson, and the author are currently\npursuing a program to demonstrate that the algebraic structures discovered here are homeomorphism invariants (at least over the rationals) in the following sense: the partial restricted\nalgebras that correspond to homeomorphic pseudomanifolds are related by a chain of homomorphisms of partial restricted algebras that are weak equivalences, meaning that they\ninduce isomorphisms at the level of homology. This is a stronger statement than that which\nfollows from Goresky-MacPherson [13], which assures us only that there is a homeomorphisminvariant restricted algebra structure in the derived category.\nFurthermore, Wilson's paper [24] implies that, over the rationals, partial commutative\nDGAs can be rectified to ordinary commutative DGAs. We propose to prove the analogous\nstatement for partial restricted chain algebras. This would provide a way of assigning to a PL\npseudomanifold a rational restricted commutative DGA that could be seen as an \"intersection\" analogue of Sullivan's rational polynomial de Rham complex of PL forms. Such DGAs\n4\n\n\fshould prove interesting objects of study, perhaps leading to a theory of intersection rational homotopy groups, or to a singular space version of the Deligne-Griffiths-Morgan-Sullivan\ntheorem [6]. These invariants would be more refined than classical rational homotopy theory\nin the same sense that intersection homology groups provide more refined information than\nordinary homology groups on spaces carrying the appropriate filtration structures. Conjecturally, these may be a rational version of the intersection homotopy groups of Gajer\n[10, 11].\nFurther results over other coefficient rings may be possible by employing E\u221e structures.\nAcknowledgment. I thank Jim McClure and Scott Wilson for many helpful discussions,\nand Jim McClure especially for providing motivation and straightening out the sign issues.\nMark Hovey was instrumental in working out the details of the category of perverse chain\ncomplexes.\nA note on changes from the original version of [20]. During the initial writing of\nthis paper, in particular the sections concerning the comparison of the Goresky-MacPherson\nintersection product with the generalized intersection pairing defined in Section 4.2, below, it\nbecame clear that certain signs (powers of \u22121) were not working out quite right. This led to\na re-examination by McClure of his pairings in the original version of [20] and the discovery\nthat some changes were necessary in order both to conform to Koszul sign conventions and to\nobtain the appropriate associativity of his multi-products. These changes will be described in\na forthcoming revision of [20] by McClure and are incorporated into this paper. We provide\nhere a short list of the main modifications as a convenience to the reader already familiar\nwith the original version of [20] who would like a quick overview of what is different here.\nThe reasoning behind these changes, as well as the relevant definitions, are provided more\nfully as these notions arise, below; some of the more technical computations are collected\nin Appendix A, both for ease of access for those interested only in the changes from the\noriginal version of [20] and to avoid cluttering the main text even further than necessary.\nThe correct signs are due to McClure.\n1. Our Poincar\u00e9 duality map incorporates a sign x \u2192 (\u22121)m|x| x \u2229 \u0393, where \u0393 is the fundamental class of an m-dimensional oriented (pseudo-)manifold, and |x| is the degree\nof the cohomology class x. See Section 4.1.\n2. We replace McClure's original exterior product \u03b5 : C\u2217 (X)\u2297C\u2217(Y ) \u2192 C\u2217 (X \u00d7Y ) with a\nproduct \u03b5\u0304 : S \u2212n1 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 S \u2212n2 C\u2217 (Y ) \u2192 S \u2212n1 \u2212n2 C\u2217 (X \u00d7 Y ). This map is defined to be\n(\u22121)dim(X) dim(Y ) times the composition of the appropriate (signed!) chain isomorphism\nS \u2212n1 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 S \u2212n2 C\u2217 (Y ) \u223c\n= S \u2212n1 \u2212n2 (C\u2217 (X) \u2297 C\u2217 (Y )) with S \u2212n1 \u2212n2 \u03b5. See Section 3.1.\n3. Gk is redefined in the obvious way to incorporate the shifts of the chain complexes\ninvolved, and the proofs of Theorems 3.5 and 3.7, corresponding to McClure's Proposition 12.3, must be modified to take these into account. In particular, some new care\nmust be taken with the homotopy and product arguments.\n5\n\n\fThese sign issues are discussed further in Section 4.1, throughout the text as they arise,\nand also in Appendix A, in which we verify some of the resulting fixes.\n\n2\n\nBackground\n\nIn this section, we recall some background definitions.\nPseudomanifolds. Let c(Z) denote the open cone on the space Z, and let c(\u2205) be a point.\nA stratified paracompact Hausdorff space Y (see [13] or [4]) is defined by a filtration\nY = Y n \u2283 Y n\u22121 \u2283 Y n\u22122 \u2283 * * * \u2283 Y 0 \u2283 Y \u22121 = \u2205\nsuch that for each point y \u2208 Yi = Y i \u2212 Y i\u22121 , there exists a distinguished neighborhood U of\ny such that there is a compact Hausdorff space L, a filtration of L\nL = Ln\u2212i\u22121 \u2283 * * * \u2283 L0 \u2283 L\u22121 = \u2205,\nand a homeomorphism\n\u03c6 : Ri \u00d7 c(L) \u2192 U\nthat takes Ri \u00d7c(Lj\u22121 ) onto Y i+j \u2229U. The subspace Yi = Y i \u2212Y i\u22121 is called the ith stratum,\nand, in particular, it is a (possibly empty) i-manifold. L is called the link of the component\nof the stratum; it is, in general, not uniquely determined, though it will be unique when Y\nis a stratified PL pseudomanifold, as defined in the next paragraph.\nA PL-pseudomanifold of dimension n is a PL space X (equipped with a class of locally\nfinite triangulations) containing a closed PL subspace \u03a3 of codimension at least 2 such that\nX \u2212\u03a3 is a PL manifold of dimension n dense in X. A stratified PL-pseudomanifold of dimension n is a PL pseudomanifold equipped with a specific filtration such that \u03a3 = X n\u22122 and the\nlocal normal triviality conditions of a stratified space hold with the trivializing homeomorphisms \u03c6 being PL homeomorphisms and each L being, inductively, a PL pseudomanifold.\nIn fact, for any PL-pseudomanifold X, such a stratification always exists such that the filtration refines the standard filtration of X by k-skeletons with respect to some triangulation\n[2, Chptr. I]. Furthermore, intersection homology is known to be a topological invariant of\nsuch spaces; in particular, it is invariant under choice of triangulation or stratification (see\n[13], [2], [15]).\nA PL pseudomanifold X is oriented if X \u2212 \u03a3 is oriented as a manifold.\nIntersection homology. In the context of PL-pseudomanifolds, the intersection chain\ncomplex, as defined initially by Goresky and MacPherson [12] (see also [2, Chapter I]),\nis a subcomplex of the complex C\u2217 (X) of PL-chains on X. This C\u2217 (X) is a direct limit\nlimT \u2208T C\u2217T (X), where C\u2217T (X) is the simplicial chain complex with respect to the triangulation\n\u2212\u2192\nT and the direct limit is taken with respect to subdivision within a family of triangulations\ncompatible with each other under subdivision and compatible with the stratification of X.\n\n6\n\n\fIntersection chain complexes are subcomplexes of C\u2217 (X) defined with regard to perversity\nparameters p\u0304 : Z\u22652 \u2192 Z+ that are required to satisfy p\u0304(2) = 0 and p\u0304(k) \u2264 p\u0304(k+1) \u2264 p\u0304(k)+1.\nWe think of the perversity as taking the codimensions of the strata of X as input. The\noutput tells us the extent to which chains in the intersection chain complex will be allowed\nto intersect that stratum. Thus a simplex \u03c3 in Ci (X) (represented by a simplex in some\ntriangulation) is deemed p\u0304-allowable if dim(\u03c3 \u2229 X n\u2212k ) \u2264 i \u2212 k + p\u0304(k), and a chain \u03be \u2208 Ci (X)\nis p\u0304-allowable if every simplex with non-zero coefficient in \u03be or \u2202\u03be is allowable as a simplex.\nThe allowable chains constitute the chain complex I p\u0304 C\u2217 (X), and the p\u0304-perversity intersection\nhomology groups are the homology groups of this chain complex.\nWe also note here that one can proceed with two versions of this: one can use the usual\ncompactly supported chains that, in a given triangulation, can be described by finitely many\nsimplices with non-zero coefficients. Or, one may use Borel-Moore chains, for which one\nrequires only that chains contain locally-finite numbers of simplices with non-zero coefficients.\nThis latter case is important to the sheaf-theoretic version of intersection homology and will\nbe important to us in Section 6, below. We will denote the Borel-Moore chain complex by\nC\u2217\u221e (X), and, when we need to be precise, we will denote the compactly supported complex\nby C\u2217c (X). No decoration generally will imply compactly supported chains. The intersection\nchain complexes and homology groups will share the corresponding notation.\nFor more background on intersection homology, we urge the reader to consult the exposition by Borel, et. al. [2]. For both background and application of intersection homology\nin various fields of mathematics, the reader should see Kirwan and Woolf [16].\n\n3\n\nStratified general position for pseudomanifolds\n\nIn this section, we study the domain for the intersection products of chains in a pseudomanifold. We begin by developing some preliminary notations and definitions based on those in\nMcClure [20].\n\n3.1\n\nPreliminaries and statements of theorems.\n\nLet X be an n-dimensional PL stratified pseudomanifold. We will denote the k-fold product\nof X with itself by X(k) (to avoid confusion with the skeleton X m ). We give the product\nS\nthe obvious stratification: X(k)m = Pk di =m X d1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 X dk .\ni\nAs in [20], let k\u0304 = {1, . . . , k} for k > 1, and let 0\u0304 = \u2205. If R : k\u0304 \u2192 k\u0304 \u2032 is any map of sets,\nlet R\u2217 : X(k \u2032 ) \u2192 X(k) denote the induced composition\nX(k \u2032 ) = Map(k\u0304 \u2032 , X) \u2192 Map(k\u0304, X) = X(k).\nThen R\u2217 (x1 , . . . , xk\u2032 ) = (xR(1) , . . . , xR(k) ). These maps represent generalizations of the standard diagonal embedding \u2206 : X \u0592\u2192 X \u00d7 X.\nWe note that if R : k\u0304 \u2192 k\u0304 \u2032 is surjective, then R\u2217 : X(k \u2032 ) \u2192 X(k) has the property that\neach component of each stratum of X(k \u2032 ) injects into a component of a stratum of X(k). In\nparticular, the stratum Xd1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7Xdk\u2032 injects into XdR(1) \u00d7. . .\u00d7XdR(k) . Furthermore, for each\n7\n\n\fstratum component of Xd1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7Xdk \u2282 X(k), (R\u2217 )\u22121 (Xd1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7Xdk ) is either empty (if there\nexist 1 \u2264 i, l \u2264 k such that R(i) = R(l) but di 6= dl ) or contained in XdR\u22121 (1) \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 XdR\u22121 (k\u2032 )\n(if di = dl whenever R(i) = R(l)). Note that, in the latter case, each dR\u22121 (a) is well-defined\nprecisely because of the condition that di = dl whenever R(i) = R(l).\nThe following definition generalizes McClure's definition in [20] of general position for\nmaps of manifolds:\nDefinition 3.1. If A is a PL subset of X(k), we will say that A is in stratified general\nposition with respect to R\u2217 if for each stratum component Z = Xd1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Xdk of X(k) such\nthat di = dl if R(i) = R(l), we have\n\u2032\n\n\u2217 \u22121\n\ndim((R ) (A \u2229 Z)) \u2264 dim(A \u2229 Z) +\n\nk\nX\n\ndR\u22121 (i) \u2212\n\ni=1\n\nk\nX\n\ndi .\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nIn other words, A is in stratified general position with respect to R\u2217 if for each stratum\ncomponent Z of X(k), A \u2229 Z is in general position with respect to the map of manifolds\nfrom the stratum containing (R\u2217 )\u22121 (Z) to Z. A PL chain is said to be in stratified general\n\u2217\nposition if its support is, and we write C\u2217R (X(k)) for the subcomplex of PL chains D of\nC\u2217 (X(k)) such that both D and \u2202D are in stratified general position with respect to R\u2217 .\nWe will also need two other notions from [20]. First, for a differential graded complex\nC\u2217 , we let S m C\u2217 be the shifted complex with (S m C\u2217 )i = Ci\u2212m and \u2202S m C\u2217 = (\u22121)m \u2202C\u2217 . This\nlast notation differs from [20], where \u03a3m is used to denote the shift; we here reserve \u03a3 for\nsingular loci of pseudomanifolds. This shift is introduced so that all maps, including the\npairing maps to be introduced below, will be degree 0 chain morphisms. When C\u2217 (X) is a\ngeometric chain complex, we let the notion of the support of a chain be independent of the\nfunctor; in other words, we take |S \u2212n x| = |x|, the geometric support of the chain x \u2208 C\u2217 (X).\nRemark 3.2. We note that for chain complexes C\u2217 and D\u2217 , S \u2212m\u2212n (C\u2217 \u2297 D\u2217 ) and S \u2212m C\u2217 \u2297\nS \u2212n C\u2217 are not in general isomorphic as chain complexes by the obvious homomorphism\nsince \u2202S \u2212m\u2212n (c \u2297 d) = (\u22121)m+n S \u2212m\u2212n \u2202(c \u2297 d) = (\u22121)m+n S \u2212m\u2212n (\u2202c \u2297 d + (\u22121)|c| c \u2297 \u2202d),\nwhere |c| is the degree of c. On the other hand, \u2202(S \u2212m c \u2297 S \u2212n d) = (\u22121)m S \u2212m \u2202c \u2297\nS \u2212n d + (\u22121)m+|c|+n S \u2212n c \u2297 S \u2212n \u2202d. The appropriate isomorphism must take S \u2212m\u2212n (c \u2297 d)\nto (\u22121)n deg(c) S \u2212m c \u2297 S \u2212n d. This sign correction was not taken into account in the original\nversion of [20].\nP\nMore generally, for complexes Ai\u2217 , define \u0398 : S m1 A1\u2217 \u2297* * *\u2297S mk Ak\u2217 \u2192 S mi (A\u22171 \u2297* * *\u2297Ak\u2217 )\nby\nPk\nP\nP\n\u0398(S m1 x1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S mk xk ) = (\u22121) i=2 (mi j<i |xj |) S mi (x1 \u2297 * * * \u00d7 xk ).\nThis is a chain isomorphism; see Lemma 7.1, in Appendix A below.\nSecondly, we will need to consider the exterior product \u03b5 defined in [20, Section 7]. The\nproduct \u03b5 is the multilinear extension of the product that takes \u03c31 \u2297 \u03c32 , where the \u03c3i are\noriented simplices, to a chain with support |\u03c31 | \u00d7 |\u03c32 | and with appropriate orientation. This\nis a direct generalization of the standard simplicial cross product construction (see e.g. [22]);\nwe refer the reader to [20, Section 7] for details. The original version of [20] used only this\n8\n\n\fproduct, but the revised version incorporates a sign and grading correction in order to define\n\u03b5\u0304, which will be appropriately Poincar\u00e9 dual to the cross product on cochains; without these\nsign and grading corrections, this duality occurs only up to signs. In [20], \u03b5k is defined\nas a map from C\u2217 (M1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 C\u2217 (Mk ) \u2192 C\u2217 (M1P\u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Mk ). With dim(Xi ) = mi , we\ndefine \u03b5\u0304k : S \u2212m1 C\u2217 (X1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212mk C\u2217 (Xk ) \u2192 S \u2212 mi C\u2217 (X1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Xk ) as (\u22121)e2 (m1 ,...,mk )\ntimes\nthe composition of the chain isomorphism \u0398 : S \u2212m1 C\u2217 (X1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212mk C\u2217 (Xk ) \u2192\nP\nP\nS \u2212 mi (C\u2217 (X1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Xk )) described in the preceding paragraph with the \u2212 mi shift of\nMcClure's \u03b5. Here e2 (m1 , . . . , mk ) is the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree two\nP P\non the symbols m1 , . . . , mk , so e2 (m1 , . . . , mk ) = ki=1 j<i mi mj . In other words, \u03b5\u0304 is the\ncomposite\n\u0398\n\nS \u2212m1 C\u2217 (X1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212mk C\u2217 (Xk )\n\n(\u22121)e2 S \u2212\n\n\u2732\nP\n\nmi\n\nS\u2212\n\nP\n\nmi\n\n(C\u2217 (X1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 C\u2217 (Xk ))\n\n\u03b5 \u2732 \u2212 P mi\nS\nC\u2217 (X1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Xk ).\n\nAs for \u03b5, \u03b5\u0304 is a monomorphism. Furthermore, it is a degree 0 chain map since \u0398 and \u03b5 are.\nThe map \u03b5\u0304 so-defined is Poincar\u00e9 dual to the iterated cochain cross product; see Lemma\n7.2 in Appendix A. This version of the chain product also corrects the commutativity of\nLemma 10.5b from the original version of [20]; see Lemma 7.4 in Appendix A.\n3.1.1\n\nDomains\n\nWith the notation introduced above, we can define our domain for the intersection pairing:\nDefinition 3.3. For k \u2265 2, let the domain Gk be the subcomplex of (S \u2212n C\u2217 X)\u2297k consisting\nof elements D such that both \u03b5\u0304(D) and \u03b5\u0304(\u2202D) are in stratified general position with respect\nto all generalized diagonal maps, i.e.\n\\ \\\n\u2217\n\u03b5\u0304\u22121 (S \u2212nk C\u2217R (X(k))).\nGk =\nk \u2032 <k R:k\u0304\u0589k\u0304 \u2032\n\nRemark 3.4. The reason for the shifting is so that the intersection product becomes a degree\n0 chain map. See [20].\nWe can now state our main theorems concerning domains.\nTheorem 3.5. The inclusion Gk \u0592\u2192 (S \u2212n C\u2217 X)\u2297k is a quasi-isomorphism for all k \u2265 1.\nFor intersection chains, we must generalize slightly.\nDefinition 3.6. Let P = (p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k ) be a collection of traditional perversities, and let\nGPk = Gk \u2229 (S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u03041 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u0304k (X)). In other words, GPk consists of those chains\nD in S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u03041 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u0304k (X) such that \u03b5\u0304k (D) and \u03b5\u0304k (\u2202D) are in stratified general\nposition with respect to R\u2217 for all surjective R : k\u0304 \u0589 k\u0304 \u2032 .\nTheorem 3.7. The inclusion GPk \u0592\u2192 S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u03041 (X)\u2297* * *\u2297S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u0304k (X) is a quasi-isomorphism.\n9\n\n\fRemark 3.8. These theorems can be generalized to include other cases of interest in intersection homology. We could incorporate local coefficient systems defined on X \u2212 \u03a3,\nor, more generally, multiple local coefficient systems Li and work with S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u03041 (X; L1 ) \u2297\n* * * \u2297 S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u0304k (X; Lk ). We could also instead consider the complexes C\u2217\u221e (X) and IC\u2217\u221e (X).\nIn fact, the definitions of general position carry over immediately, and all homotopies constructed in the following proof are proper, thus they yield well-defined maps on these locallyfinite chain complexes. The proofs that Gk and GPk are quasi-isomorphic to the appropriate\ntensor products is the same. We can also consider \"mixed type\" versions of Gk that are quasiisomorphic to S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217\u221e (X)\u2297* * * S \u2212n I p\u0304j C\u2217\u221e (X)\u2297S \u2212n I p\u0304j+1 C\u2217c (X)\u2297* * *\u2297S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217c (X). The\nnecessary modifications are fairly direct.\nThe proofs of Theorems 3.5 and 3.7 (as well as of the more general cases mentioned in the\nremark) are nearly identical, so we will present only the proof of Theorem 3.5 in detail. For\nP\nTheorem 3.7, we simply note that instead of chains of the form A na S \u2212n \u03c4ai \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n \u03c4ak ,\nP\nwe would instead consider chains A na S \u2212n \u03beai \u2297* * *\u2297S \u2212n \u03beak , where each \u03beaj is a p\u0304j allowable\nchain in X. We note also that since all homotopies constructed below are stratum-preserving\nand proper, they preserve allowability of chains (compactly supported or not), and the\ninduced homologies will also be allowable (see [8, 9]).\n\n3.2\n\nProof of Theorem 3.5\n\nIn this subsection, we prove Theorem 3.5.\nProof of Theorem 3.5. The proof follows the outline of that of McClure's [20, Proposition\n12.2], and many of the steps are essentially identical. However, there are some points at which\nit is necessary to pay closer attention to the stratification, and one large step (our variant of\nMcClure's Proposition 14.6) that must be done entirely differently. This is because McClure\ncovers his manifolds with euclidean balls and then employs general position arguments within\nthese euclidean structures; even modified versions of this covering approach seem to fail on\nstratified spaces. We will roughly follow the entire proof in order to achieve a sense of\ncompleteness and to ensure that all steps at which the stratification enters materially are\nproperly addressed. However, we will refer often to [20], particularly for steps that do not\nrely on explicit mention of the stratification.\nWe recall that if X is a stratified spaces, a (PL) homotopy H : Y \u00d7 I \u2192 X is called\nstratum preserving if for each y \u2208 Y , H(y, I) is contained in a single stratum of X. If\n\u03c6 : X \u00d7 I \u2192 X is a stratum preserving homotopy and l is an integer 1 \u2264 l \u2264 k, then there\nis an lth factor homotopy determined by\nid\u00d7\u03c6\u00d7id\nX(k) \u00d7 I \u223c\n= X(l \u2212 1) \u00d7 X \u00d7 I \u00d7 X(k \u2212 l) \u2192 X(k),\n\nand this homotopy is stratum-preserving. Our goal, generally speaking, is to use stratumpreserving homotopies to push chains into general position one factor at a time.\nFor this, we first need a version of McClure's Lemma 13.2 [20], which says, essentially,\nthat lth factor homotopies take products of chains to products of chains. It is fairly straightforward that McClure's lemma remains true in our context, though we update the statement,\nmostly to take account of the change from \u03b5 to \u03b5\u0304 (see above).\n10\n\n\fTo account for some of the shifting, notice that (S \u2212nk C\u2217 (X(k))) \u2297 C\u2217 (I) is canonically\nisomorphic to S \u2212nk (C\u2217 (X(k))\u2297C\u2217(I)) with no signs coming in (since we associate no suspension to the C\u2217 (I) term). Thus we have a well-defined chain map S \u2212nk \u03b5 : S \u2212nk (C\u2217 (X(k)) \u2297\nC\u2217 (I)) \u2192 S \u2212nk C\u2217 (X(k) \u00d7 I).\nLemma 3.9. Let h : X(k) \u00d7 I \u2192 X(k) be an lth factor stratum-preserving homotopy, and\nsuppose that C is in the image of \u03b5\u0304k . Then\n1. S \u2212nk (h \u25e6 i1 )\u2217 C is in the image of \u03b5\u0304k , and\n2. If \u03b9 is the canonical generator of C1 (I), then (S \u2212nk h\u2217 )(S \u2212nk \u03b5)(C \u2297 \u03b9) is in the image\nof \u03b5\u0304k .\nIn other words, an lth factor homotopy homotopes a product to a product, and the trace\nof the homotopy is also a product.\nNext, we recall McClure's filtration [20, Definition 13.3] of (S \u2212m C\u2217 M)\u2297k , modified here\nto take into account our shift conventions:\nDefinition 3.10.\n1.

For each j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, the inclusion Gjk \u0592\u2192 Gkj\u22121 is a quasi-isomorphism.\nThe proof of this proposition relies on the following lemma, analogous to [20, Lemma\n13.5].\nLemma 3.12. Suppose D \u2208 Gkj\u22121 and \u2202D \u2208 Gjk . Then there is a jth factor stratumpreserving homotopy h : X(k) \u00d7 I \u2192 X(k) such that\n1. h \u25e6 i0 is the identity,\n2. the chains S \u2212nk (h \u25e6 i1 )\u2217 (\u03b5\u0304k D), S \u2212nk (h \u25e6 i1 )\u2217 (\u03b5\u0304k (\u2202D)), and S \u2212nk h\u2217 (S \u2212nk \u03b5(\u03b5\u0304k (\u2202D) \u2297 \u03b9))\nare in stratified general position with respect to R\u2217 for all R \u2208 \u039bj ,\n3. S \u2212nk h\u2217 (S \u2212nk \u03b5(\u03b5\u0304k (D) \u2297 \u03b9)) is in stratified general position with respect to R\u2217 for all\nR \u2208 \u039bj\u22121.\n\n11\n\n\fAssuming this lemma, the proof of Proposition 3.11 follows as for [20, Proposition 13.4]\nby using the homotopy of the lemma to create the following homologies:\n1. for a cycle D \u2208 Gkj\u22121, a homology to a cycle C \u2208 Gjk such that the homology is itself\nin Gkj\u22121, and\n2. for a chain D \u2208 Gkj\u22121 with \u2202D \u2208 Gjk , a relative homology to a chain in Gjk whose\nboundary is also \u2202D, and such that the homology is itself in Gkj\u22121.\nWe run through the argument because the new shift conventions must be taken into account\n(though ultimately they don't do any harm to the essence of McClure's argument).\nGiven a cycle D as stated and the h guaranteed by the Lemma, S \u2212nk (h \u25e6 i1 )\u2217 \u03b5\u0304k D is in\nthe image of \u03b5\u0304k by Lemma 3.9. Since \u03b5\u0304k is a monomorphism, C = (\u03b5\u0304k )\u22121 (S \u2212nk (h \u25e6 i1 )\u2217 \u03b5\u0304k D)\nis a well-defined cycle. By Lemma 3.12, C \u2208 Gjk .\nSimilarly, by Lemma 3.9, (S \u2212nk h\u2217 )(S \u2212nk \u03b5)((\u03b5\u0304k D) \u2297 \u03b9) is in the image of \u03b5\u0304k . Let E be the\ninverse image of this chain under \u03b5\u0304k . By Lemma 3.12, E \u2208 Gkj\u22121.\nAs in [20], let \u03bb, \u03ba \u2208 C0 (I) such that \u2202\u03b9 = \u03bb \u2212 \u03ba. Then\n\u03b5\u0304k (\u2202E) = \u2202(S \u2212nk h\u2217 )(S \u2212nk \u03b5)((\u03b5\u0304k D) \u2297 \u03b9)\n= (S \u2212nk h\u2217 )(S \u2212nk \u03b5)\u2202((\u03b5\u0304k D) \u2297 \u03b9)\n= (S \u2212nk h\u2217 )(S \u2212nk \u03b5)(\u2202(\u03b5\u0304k D) \u2297 \u03b9 + (\u22121)|\u03b5\u0304k D| \u03b5\u0304D \u2297 (\u03bb \u2212 \u03ba))\n= 0 + (\u22121)|\u03b5\u0304k D| (S \u2212nk h\u2217 )(S \u2212nk \u03b5)(\u03b5\u0304k D \u2297 (\u03bb \u2212 \u03ba))\n= (\u22121)|\u03b5\u0304k D| (S \u2212nk (h \u25e6 i1 )\u2217 (\u03b5\u0304k D) \u2212 S \u2212nk (h \u25e6 i0 )\u2217 (\u03b5\u0304k D))\n= (\u22121)|\u03b5\u0304k D| \u03b5\u0304k (C \u2212 D).\nThus C and D are homologous, since \u03b5\u0304k is a monomorphism.\nSimilarly, to check the second statement, let D \u2208 Gkj\u22121 with \u2202D = C \u2208 Gjk , and choose\na homotopy h as given by Lemma 3.12.\nThen S \u2212nk (h \u25e6 i1 )\u2217 \u03b5\u0304k D and (S \u2212nk h\u2217 )(S \u2212nk \u03b5)(\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D \u2297 \u03b9) are in the image of \u03b5\u0304k . Let E1\nand E2 be the respective inverse images, which are in Gjk by Lemma 3.12. Now\n\u03b5\u0304k (\u2202E2 ) = \u2202(S \u2212nk h\u2217 )(S \u2212nk \u03b5)(\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D \u2297 \u03b9)\n= (\u22121)|\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D| (S \u2212nk h\u2217 )(S \u2212nk \u03b5)(\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D \u2297 (\u03bb \u2212 \u03ba))\n= (\u22121)|\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D| (S \u2212nk (h \u25e6 i1 )\u2217 (\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D) \u2212 S \u2212nk (h \u25e6 i0 )\u2217 (\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D))\n= (\u22121)|\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D| \u03b5\u0304k (\u2202E1 \u2212 C)\n\nThus, since \u03b5\u0304k is a monomorphism, C = \u2202(E1 + (\u22121)|\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D| E2 ).\nSo we must prove Lemma 3.12.\n\n12\n\n\fProof of Lemma 3.12. To simplify the notation, we will assume that j = k. The other cases\nmay be obtained by obvious modifications that would require overcomplicating the formulas\nthat follow.\nWe suppose that D is a chain in Gkk\u22121 and that \u2202D \u2208 Gkk . We must show that there is a\nkth factor homotopy h : X \u00d7 I \u2192 X such that\n1. h \u25e6 i0 is the identity (where i0 is the inclusion X = X \u00d7 0 \u0592\u2192 X \u00d7 I),\n2. S \u2212nk (h\u25e6i1 )\u2217 (\u03b5\u0304k D), S \u2212nk (h\u25e6i1 )\u2217 (\u03b5\u0304k (\u2202D)), and S \u2212n h\u2217 (S \u2212nk \u03b5(\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D \u2297\u03b9)) are in stratified\ngeneral position with respect to R\u2217 for all R : k\u0304 \u0589 k\u0304 \u2032 (where i1 is the inclusion\nX = X \u00d7 1 \u0592\u2192 X \u00d7 I and \u03b9 is the canonical chain in C1 (I)), and\n3. S \u2212nk h\u2217 (S \u2212nk \u03b5(\u03b5\u0304k D \u2297 \u03b9)) is in stratified general position with respect to R\u2217 for all\nR \u2208 \u039bk\u22121.\nWe choose a triangulation K of X such that D \u2208 (c\u2217 K)\u2297k . We let \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4\u03c9 be the\nsimplices of K with fixed, arbitrary orientations. Then we can write\nX\nD=\nnA S \u2212n \u03c4a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n \u03c4ak ,\nA\n\nwhere the sum runs over multi-indices A = (a1 , * * * , ak ) \u2208 {1, . . . , \u03c9}k .

Although the proposition is\nanalogous, it is the proof of this proposition for which we need most greatly differ from [20],\nas we have not been able to construct a proof using McClure's methods.\nProposition 3.13. Let X be a stratified PL pseudomanifold of dimension n, and let K be a\ntriangulation of X. Then there is a stratum-preserving PL isotopy \u03c6 : X \u00d7 I \u2192 X such that\n1. \u03c6|X\u00d70 is the identity,\n2. if \u03c3 and \u03c4 are simplices of K, then \u03c6(\u03c3, 1) and \u03c4 are in stratified general position, i.e.\ndim(\u03c6(\u03c3, 1) \u2229 \u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u2264 dim(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) + dim(\u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u2212 \u03ba\nfor all \u03ba, 0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n (note that since \u03c6 is an isotopy, dim(\u03c3 \u2229X\u03ba ) = dim(\u03c6(\u03c3, 1)\u2229X\u03ba )),\nand\n3. if \u03c3 and \u03c4 are simplices of K, then for all \u03ba, 0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n,\ndim(\u03c6((\u03c3\u2229X\u03ba )\u00d7I)\u2229\u03c4 ) \u2264 max(dim(supp(\u03c6((\u03c3\u2229X\u03ba )\u00d7I)))+dim(\u03c4 \u2229X\u03ba )\u2212\u03ba, dim(\u03c3\u2229\u03c4 \u2229X\u03ba )).\n\n13\n\n\fThe proof of the proposition is deferred to below.\nLet h : X(k) \u00d7 I \u2192 I be the kth factor homotopy obtained from the isotopy \u03c6 of the\nproposition. Note that since \u03c6 was stratum-preserving, so is h. Let R : k\u0304 \u2192 k\u0304 \u2032 be any\nsurjection. We must verify that the various chains described above are in the appropriate\ngeneral position with respect to R\u2217 . We will show explicitly that S \u2212nk h\u2217 (S \u2212nk \u03b5(\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D \u2297 \u03b9))\nis in stratified general position with respect to R\u2217 , the other proofs being similar.\nTo simplify the notation somewhat in what follows, we will employ the following substitution in order to remove the shifts. Notice that, as far as supports of chains are concerned, the\nP\nsupport of S \u2212nk h\u2217 (S \u2212nk \u03b5(\u03b5\u0304k \u2202D\u2297\u03b9)) = S \u2212nk h\u2217 (S \u2212nk \u03b5(\u03b5\u0304k A|n\u2032 6=0 n\u2032A S \u2212n \u03c4a1 \u2297* * *\u2297S \u2212n \u03c4ak \u2297\u03b9))\nA\nP\nis precisely the same as that of h\u2217 (\u03b5k+1 ( A|n\u2032 6=0 n\u2032A S \u2212n \u03c4a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n \u03c4ak \u2297 \u03b9)) \u2208 C\u2217 (X(k)).\nA\nThis is because we are done taking boundaries at this point, so the various signs that come\ninto play from the dimension shifts no longer need to be taken into account. The only thing\nthat matters at this point are which terms are non-zero, and that is already settled. Thus for\nthe purpose of checking the dimensions of intersections in order to make sure that stratified\ngeneral position is satisfied (which is all that remains to do in this section), we are free to\nP\nreplace \u2202D with \u2202 D\u0304 = A|n\u2032 6=0 n\u2032A \u03c4a1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c4ak and to proceed using \u03b5 and h\u2217 instead of\nA\ntheir shifted versions. We make this change now.\nWe must consider what happens on each stratum Z = Xd1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Xdk of X(k). As we\nhave previously noted, if R(a) = R(b) but da 6= db for any pair a, b \u2208 k\u0304, then R\u2217 (X(k \u2032 )) does\nnot intersect this stratum and general position for this stratum is automatic.

The proof will make use of McCrory's proof of his stratified general position theorem [21]. This in turn makes use of the general position constructions\nfor manifolds presented by Zeeman in [25, Chapter 6]. McCrory shows that given a \"stratified polyhedron\" (the definition of which includes our stratified PL pseudomanifold X),\nand closed subpolyhedra A, B, C such that B \u2283 C, then there exists an \u01eb-PL isotopy\nH : X \u00d7 I \u2192 X such that H(c, t) = c for all c \u2208 C, t \u2208 I and H(B \u2212 C, 1) and A are\nin stratified general position, i.e. (B \u2212 C) \u2229 Xi and A \u2229 Xi are in general position in Xi for\neach i-manifold Xi .\nThe construction of McCrory's isotopy is by a double sequence of local \"(j, \u03ba)-shifts\" that\nworks up through the strata and down through the simplices of each stratum. In other words,\none constructs a sequence of isotopies G1 , . . . , Gn such that G\u03ba fixes X \u03ba\u22121 (and C), and each\nG\u03ba is, in turn, composed of a sequence of isotopies F j,\u03ba , where the parameter j descends\nthrough the dimensions of simplices2 of X \u03ba \u2212X \u03ba\u22121 . Each F j,\u03ba consists of simultaneous disjoint\nlocal isotopies of neighborhoods in X of the j-simplices of X \u03ba \u2212 X \u03ba\u22121 . These neighborhoods\nmay meet along their boundaries, but the local isotopies are fixed on these boundaries, so\nthere is no problem with performing all of the local isotopies of F j,\u03ba simultaneously. Each\nsuch (j, \u03ba)-shift is constructed by applying in X\u03ba Zeeman's shift construction for manifolds\nand then joining this Zeeman shift with the identity map on the link L of the stratum (to be\ncompletely precise, one must also take into account the standard stratified homeomorphism\nbetween local neighborhoods of simplices and standard distinguished neighborhoods of the\n2\n\nBy a simplex of U \u2212 V , we mean a simplex of U that is not contained in V .\n\n18\n\n\fform B \u03ba \u00d7 c\u0304L - see [21]). By the arguments presented by McCrory [21] and Zeeman [25], the\nend result of this sequence of isotopies puts B \u2212 C in stratified general position with respect\nto A.\nOur isotopy will be constructed similarly, by performing (j, \u03ba)-shifts for all possible simplices. For this purpose, there are two important points to note:\n\u2022 As McCrory notes, the set A comes into his construction only in that the triangulation\nK is chosen so that A is a subcomplex. Thus one should expect that the choice of A\nis irrelevant beyond this, and thus by performing the appropriate (j, \u03ba)-shifts, one can\nput any subcomplex of K into general position with respect to all other subcomplexes\nof K simultaneously.\nIn fact, it is not completely true that this is the only way that A comes into the\ndefinition of McCrory's shift. In Zeeman's shift construction, which is the cornerstone\nof McCrory's, A (there played by the symbol Y ), also enters into which simplices have\ntheir neighborhoods shifted and into the definition of the shift. The first issue - only\nshifting simplices that actually intersect A - simply limits the number of local isotopies\nbeing performed to avoid unnecessary ones, but performing extra local isotopies does\nno harm. As for how the shifts are actually defined, the only fact about A that is\nsignificant in the definition of Zeeman's shift is that the intersection of A with the\nlink of the simplex \u03b7 whose neighborhood is to be shifted should not be the entire\nlinking sphere (Zeeman works exclusively in the realm of manifolds). This allows\none to construct a homeomorphism between the standard simplex (of the appropriate\ndimension) and the transverse disk to \u03b7 such that the intersection of A with the link\nof \u03b7 gets mapped into a single face of the standard simplex.\nIn our case (or McCrory's), if we wish to perform a (j, \u03ba)-shift in a neighborhood of\na j-simplex \u03b7 of X\u03ba and the intersection of A with the link of \u03b7 in X\u03ba is the entire\n\u03ba \u2212 j \u2212 1 dimensional linking sphere, then in fact an entire star neighborhood of \u03b7\nin X\u03ba will be contained in A, and general position with respect to A \u2229 X\u03ba in X\u03ba will\nautomatically be satisfied. Thus in order to define each (j, \u03ba)-shift for each fixed \u03ba, it\nwill suffice to allow the \u03ba \u2212 1 skeleton of X \u03ba (in the relevant triangulation at the time)\nto play the role of A for the purpose of applying Zeeman's construction to define the\nlocal shifts.\n\u2022 As for A, B also comes into the construction of McCrory's isotopy both as determining\nwhich simplices should have their neighborhoods shifted and in the determination of\nthe actual shifts. Once again, shifts in the McCrory construction are limited to those\nsurrounding simplices that lie in B, but once again, this is an unnecessary limitation making additional shifts does no harm. And once again, it is necessary for constructing\nZeeman's shift within McCrory's that the intersection of B (there called X) with the\nlink in X\u03ba of the simplex \u03b7 whose neighborhood we shift should not be the entire\n\u03ba \u2212 j \u2212 1 sphere, and the reasons for this are identical. But once again, for the purpose\nof defining Zeeman's shift within the stratum X\u03ba , we may let the \u03ba \u2212 1 skeleton of\nX \u03ba play the role of Zeeman's X (McCrory's B \u2229 X\u03ba ), and then there is no difficulty\n19\n\n\fdefining the shift. Again, we are unconcerned with \u03ba-simplices in X\u03ba since these are\nautomatically in general position with respect to any polyhedra in X\u03ba .\nThus, we construct a stratum-preserving isotopy \u03c60 : X \u00d7 I \u2192 X as follows: For each \u03ba,\n1 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n, we will define an isotopy G\u03ba such that G\u03ba |X \u03ba\u22121 is the identity. We will define \u03c60\nto be the isotopy determined by performing the isotopies G1 , . . . , Gn successively.\nEach G\u03ba also comprises successive isotopies F \u03ba\u22121,\u03ba * * * F 0,\u03ba , and each F j,\u03ba consists of\nperforming McCrory's (j, \u03ba)-shift for all j-simplices of X \u03ba \u2212 X \u03ba\u22121 in the triangulation that\nhas been arrived at to that point (by requiring each isotopy to be simplicial with respect\nto successive refinements of K). Each such (j, \u03ba)-shift is built as in McCrory by joining\nthe identity map of the link of the stratum with a Zeeman shift in X\u03ba (utilizing, as in\nMcCrory, the intermediate step of homeomorphing the appropriate local neighborhoods into\nstandard distinguished neighborhoods). For the purpose of defining the Zeeman shift, we\nplug into Zeeman's machinery the intersection of the entire \u03ba \u2212 1 skeleton of X \u03ba (in the\npresent triangulation) with X\u03ba\u22121 . This skeleton plays the role of both McCrory's A and B\n(Zeeman's X and Y ).\nNow, suppose that \u03c3 and \u03c4 are any simplices of the triangulation K of X. We prove that\n\u03c60 takes \u03c3 into stratified general position with respect to \u03c4 . It suffices to show that \u03c60 takes\n\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba into general position with respect to \u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba for any \u03ba, 0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n. This is trivial\nfor \u03ba = 0. For \u03ba > 0, first the isotopies G1 , . . . , G\u03ba\u22121 take \u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba to some subpolyhedron,\nsay Z, of X\u03ba . \u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba is also such a subpolyhedron. Suppose dim(Z \u2229 X\u03ba ) (which is equal\nto dim(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba )) is equal to l and dim(Z \u2229 \u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba ) = s \u2264 l. If l = \u03ba, then we already have\ngeneral position in this stratum. Otherwise, the isotopies F \u03ba\u22121,\u03ba , . . . , F l+1,\u03ba fix Z since local\nshifts of neighborhoods of t-simplices fix the t \u2212 1 skeleton. Furthermore, while the shifts\nF l,\u03ba , . . . , F s+1,\u03ba do isotop the l, . . . , s + 1 simplices of Z, since their interiors do not intersect\n\u03c4 , it follows from the McCrory-Zeeman construction of the local shifts that the images of\ntheir interiors under the isotopy continue not to intersect \u03c4 . From here, the movement of\nthe present image of Z under the further isotopies F s,\u03ba , . . . , F dim(\u03c3\u2229X\u03ba )+dim(\u03c4 \u2229X\u03ba )\u2212\u03ba+1,\u03ba is\nexactly that of McCrory's isotopy, which pushes Z into general position with respect to\n\u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba . Finally, any remaining isotopies F dim(\u03c3\u2229X\u03ba )+dim(\u03c4 \u2229X\u03ba )\u2212\u03ba+1,\u03ba , . . . , F 0,\u03ba do not damage\nthis general position, by [25, Lemma 30].\nSince the further isotopies that constitute G\u03ba+1 , . . . , Gn fix X \u03ba , it follows that \u03c60 isotops\n\u03c3 into stratified general position with respect to \u03c4 .\nTo complete the proposition, we need to modify \u03c60 to an isotopy \u03c6 that also satisfies\ncondition (3) of the proposition. For this, let us consider \u03c60 : X \u00d7 I \u2192 I as a PL map\n\u03c8 : X \u00d7 I \u2192 X \u00d7 I, given by \u03c8(x, t) = (\u03c60 (x, t), t). We may triangulate the domain and\ncodomain copies of X \u00d7 I so that the isotopy is simplicial and also so that each triangulation\nrestricts on X \u00d70 and X \u00d71 to a refinement of K. We may also assume for each triangulation\nthat \u03b7 \u00d7 I is a subcomplex for each \u03b7 in K. Now, taking the codomain copy of X \u00d7 I with\nits triangulation, we construct a PL isotopy \u03a6 : X \u00d7 I \u00d7 I \u2192 X \u00d7 I just as we constructed\n\u03c60 above, but this time relative to X \u00d7 0 and X \u00d7 1 (in other words, X \u00d7 0 and X \u00d7 1\nare held fixed). Such relative isotopies are also considered by McCrory and Zeeman, and we\nmake the same modifications here as above - in particular we shift the neighborhoods of all\n20\n\n\fpossible simplices, this time except for those in X \u00d7 0 and X \u00d7 1. The previous arguments\nremain unchanged to demonstrate that for each \u03c3, \u03c4 in K, \u03a6(\u03c8(\u03c3 \u00d7 I), 1) \u2229 (X \u00d7 (0, 1)) is in\nstratified general position with respect to \u03c4 \u00d7 (0, 1). In particular,\ndim(\u03a6(\u03c8(\u03c3 \u00d7 I), 1) \u2229 (\u03c4 \u00d7 I) \u2229 (X\u03ba \u00d7 (0, 1)))\n\u2264 dim(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) + 1 + dim(\u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba ) + 1 \u2212 (\u03ba + 1)\n= dim(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) + 1 + dim(\u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u2212 \u03ba.\nFurthermore, of course,\ndim(\u03a6(\u03c8(\u03c3, 1), 1)\u2229(\u03c4 \u00d71)\u2229(X\u03ba \u00d71)) = dim(\u03c60 (\u03c3, 1)\u2229\u03c4 \u2229X\u03ba ) \u2264 dim(\u03c3\u2229X\u03ba )+dim(\u03c4 \u2229X\u03ba )\u2212\u03ba\nand\ndim(\u03a6(\u03c8(\u03c3, 0), 1) \u2229 (\u03c4 \u00d7 0) \u2229 (X\u03ba \u00d7 0)) = dim(\u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba ).\nNow, let \u03c0X : X \u00d7 I \u2192 X be the projection to X, let i1 : X \u00d7 I \u2192 X \u00d7 I \u00d7 I be the\ninclusion into X \u00d7 I \u00d7 1, and define \u03c6 : X \u00d7 I \u2192 X by \u03c6 = \u03c0X \u03a6i1 \u03c8. To see that \u03c6 satisfies\nthe desired requirements of the proposition, first notice that\ndim(\u03a6((\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u00d7 I) \u2229 \u03c4 )\n= max(dim(\u03c6((\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u00d7 (0, 1)) \u2229 \u03c4 ), dim(\u03c6(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba , 0) \u2229 \u03c4 ), dim(\u03c6(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba , 1) \u2229 \u03c4 )).\nNow dim(\u03c6(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba , 0) \u2229 \u03c4 ) = dim(\u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba ), and dim(\u03c6(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba , 1) \u2229 \u03c4 ) = dim(\u03c60 (\u03c3 \u2229\nX\u03ba , 1) \u2229 \u03c4 ). Furthermore, the the projection of \u03a6(\u03c8(\u03c3 \u00d7 I), 1) \u2229 (\u03c4 \u00d7 I) \u2229 (X\u03ba \u00d7 (0, 1)) to X\nmust contain \u03c6((\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u00d7 (0, 1)) \u2229 \u03c4 . By the stratified general position we have achieved,\ndim(\u03a6(\u03c8(\u03c3 \u00d7 I), 1) \u2229 (\u03c4 \u00d7 I) \u2229 (X\u03ba \u00d7 (0, 1))) \u2264 dim(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) + 1 + dim(\u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u2212 \u03ba. If\ndim(supp(\u03c6((\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u00d7 (0, 1)))) = dim(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) + 1, we are done. The only other possibility\nis that dim(supp(\u03c6((\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u00d7 (0, 1)))) = dim(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ). But by the definition of \u03c60 , this\nis only possible when dim(\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) = \u03ba. So \u03c6((\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u00d7 (0, 1)) \u2229 (\u03c4 \u00d7 I) must have the\nform (\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba \u2229 \u03c4 ) \u00d7 (0, 1). In this case, the projection X \u00d7 I \u2192 X decreases the dimension\nof this intersection by 1, and we still have dim(\u03a6(\u03c8(\u03c3 \u00d7 I), 1) \u2229 (\u03c4 \u00d7 I) \u2229 (X\u03ba \u00d7 (0, 1))) \u2264\ndim(supp(\u03c6((\u03c3 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u00d7 (0, 1)))) + dim(\u03c4 \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u2212 \u03ba.\nThis completes the proof.\n\n4\n\nIntersection pairings\n\nIn this section, we study the intersection pairings defined on our domains Gk and GPk . In\nthe simplest cases, these correspond to the simultaneous intersection of multiple chains, and\nwe will indeed show that these intersection products correspond to the iteration of GoreskyMacPherson intersection products when such are defined (though not all generalized products\nhave this form as the domains GPk allow for the \"intersection\" of more general objects). Yet\nmore general intersection products will arise in Section 5 within in the functorial machinery\nof the Leinster partial commutative algebra structure.\n21\n\n\f4.1\n\nSign issues\n\nOur initial work on the following material was hampered by several difficulties that arose\ndue to seeming inconsistencies in the signs (powers of \u22121) that occurred in the various\nformulas relating the general intersection pairing we define below with the iterated GoreskyMacPherson intersection pairing. Our struggle with these \"sign problems\" led back to an\ninconsistency with the Koszul sign conventions in the original version of McClure's paper\n[20], and this problem was traced back to some sign issues involving the definition of the\ntransfer map in Dold [7]. Given a map of oriented manifolds f : M \u2192 M \u2032 , Dold first defines\nhis (homology) transfer maps f! : H\u2217 (M \u2032 ) \u2192 H\u2217 (M) in the usual way as a composition of\nPoincar\u00e9 duality on M \u2032 , followed by the cohomology pullback f \u2217 , followed by Poincar\u00e9 duality\non M (this is the gist of the construction - Dold actually considers quite general relative\ncases - see [7, Section VIII.10]). However, there is a cryptic note on page 314 of [7], noting\nthat certain signs one should expect in resulting identities do not appear because the transfer\n\u2032\nshould be defined \"in a more systematic treatment\" with a sign (\u22121)(dim M \u2212j)(dim M \u2212dim M ) ,\nwhere j is the dimension of the chain to which f! is being applied.\nApplying this correction, however, did not completely fix the sign issues occurring here\nuntil it was noticed by McClure that the sign problem is not with the definition of the transfer\nbut with the definition of Poincar\u00e9 duality! McClure argues that the correct definition of\nthe Poincar\u00e9 duality map P : H \u2217 (M) \u2192 Hm\u2212\u2217 (M) for a closed oriented m-manifold M with\norientation class \u0393 should be given by P (x) = (\u22121)m|x| (x \u2229 \u0393). Note the sign. Of course\nthis homomorphism is an isomorphism regardless of sign, but this should be considered the\n\"correct choice\" for the following reason:\nLet C\u2217 (M) be the complex of (singular or simplicial) chains on M, and C \u2217 (M) the\ncorresponding cochain complex. As usual, we can raise or lower indices and think of\nC \u2217 (M) as a complex with differential of degree \u22121 by setting T\u2217 (X) = C \u2212\u2217 (X). Then\nH\u2217 (T\u2217 (X)) = H \u2212\u2217 (X). Then we can think of \u2229\u0393 as a homomorphism T\u2217 (X) \u2192 C\u2217+m (X),\nand \u2229\u0393 commutes with the differentials - see [7, p. 243]. But this is not the correct behavior\nfor a map of degree m according to the Koszul conventions! In order to be considered a\nchain map, a degree m homomorphism should (\u22121)m commute with the differential - see [7,\nRemark VI.10.5]. If we instead use P (x) = (\u22121)m|x| (x \u2229 \u0393), then we do obtain the desired\n(\u22121)m commutativity.\nNote that this sign choice for Poincar\u00e9 duality maps automatically incorporates the\nsign correction into Dold's transfer map since, letting m = dim M and m\u2032 = dim M \u2032 , for\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nx \u2208 Cj (M \u2032 ), we obtain f! (x) = f \u2217 ((\u22121)(m \u2212j)m (\u2229\u0393M \u2032 )\u22121 (x)) \u2229 \u0393M (\u22121)(m \u2212j)m , which is\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(\u22121)(m \u2212j)(m \u2212m) times Dold's transfer.\nFurthermore, redefining P (x) = (\u22121)m|x| S \u2212m (x \u2229 \u0393) makes this a degree 0 chain map.\nWe will use this convention for Poincar\u00e9 duality throughout. Interestingly, this sign does\nnot alter the sign of the Goresky-MacPherson intersection product [12]; see the proof of\nProposition 4.9, below.\n\n22\n\n\f4.2\n\nAn intersection homology multi-product\n\nIn this section, we construct a generalized intersection product \u03bck : GPk \u2192 S \u2212n I r\u0304 C\u2217 (X),\nwhere r\u0304 is a perversity greater than the sum of the perversities in P . This is done using a\ntransfer (umkher) map that is essentially a hybrid of the Poincar\u00e9-Whitehead duality utilized\nby Goresky-MacPherson [12] and the umkehr map of McClure [20].\nWe recall (see [2, Section II.1]) that if A and B are closed PL subspaces of respective\ndimensions i and i \u2212 1 of a PL space X, then the chains C \u2208 Ci (X) that satisfy |C| \u2282 A\nand |\u2202C| \u2282 B correspond bijectively to homology classes [X] \u2208 Hi (A, B). Thus \"in order to\nprescribe chains, we need only describe sets and homology classes.\"\nNow suppose f : X n \u2192 Y m is a PL map of compact oriented PL stratified pseudomanifolds such that f \u22121 (\u03a3Y ) \u2282 \u03a3X , where \u03a3X and \u03a3Y are the respective singular sets of X and\nY . Suppose that C \u2208 Ci (Y ) and dim(|C| \u2229 \u03a3Y ) < i. Then C corresponds to the homology\nclass [C] \u2208 Hi (|C|, |\u2202C|). Let A = |C|, B = |\u2202C|, A\u2032 = f \u22121 (A), and B \u2032 = f \u22121 (B). We\nconsider the following composition of maps\n\u2732\n\nS \u2212m Hi (A, B)\n\nS \u2212m Hi (A \u222a \u03a3Y , B \u222a \u03a3Y )\n\n(\u22121)m(m\u2212i) (* \u2229 \u0393Y )\u22121\u2732 m\u2212i\nH\n(Y \u2212 (B \u222a \u03a3Y ), Y \u2212 (A \u222a \u03a3Y ))\n\u223c\n=\nf\u2217\n\u2732 H m\u2212i (X \u2212 (B \u2032 \u222a \u03a3X ), X \u2212 (A\u2032 \u222a \u03a3X ))\n\u2229\u0393X (\u22121)n(m\u2212i)\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u2732\n\n(4)\n\nS \u2212n Hi+n\u2212m (A\u2032 \u222a \u03a3X , B \u2032 \u222a \u03a3X )\n\nThe indicated signed cap products with the respective fundamental classes represent the\nPoincar\u00e9-Whitehead-Goresky-MacPherson duality isomorphism - see [12, Appendix]. We\nalso incorporate the sign convention discussed above in Section 4.1.\nNext, we note that Hi+n\u2212m (A\u2032 \u222a\u03a3X , B \u2032 \u222a\u03a3X ) is isomorphic to Hi+n\u2212m (A\u2032 , B \u2032 \u222a(\u03a3X \u2229A\u2032 ))\nby excising out \u03a3X \u2212 \u03a3X \u2229 A\u2032 . Furthermore, if dim(\u03a3X \u2229 A\u2032 ) \u2264 i + n \u2212 m \u2212 2, then by the\nlong exact sequence of the triple (and another excision argument),\nHi+n\u2212m (A\u2032 , B \u2032 \u222a (\u03a3X \u2229 A\u2032 )) \u223c\n= Hi+n\u2212m (A\u2032 , B \u2032 ).\nSo, when this dimension condition is satisfied, we obtain a map S \u2212m Hi (A, B) \u2192 S \u2212n Hi+n\u2212m (A\u2032 , B \u2032 ),\nwhich is a morphism of degree 0.\nRemark 4.1. N.B. It is the condition dim(\u03a3X \u2229 f \u22121 (|C|)) \u2264 i + n \u2212 m \u2212 2 that will force\nthe intersection pairing to be well-defined only for intersection chains in GPk with certain\nperversity requirements on P . We cannot hope to have a well-defined pairing for Gk , in\ngeneral, unless X is, in fact, a manifold.\nNow, let \u2206 be the diagonal map X \u0592\u2192 X(k). So if R is the unique function R : k\u0304 \u2192 1\u0304,\nthen \u2206 = R\u2217 in the notation of Section 3.\nDefinition 4.2. Let S \u2212nk C\u2217\u2206 (X(k)) be the subcomplex of S \u2212nk C\u2217 (X(k)) of chains D such\nthat if D \u2208 S \u2212nk Ci+nk (X(k)) then\n23\n\n\f1. dim(|D| \u2229 \u03a3X(k) ) < dim |D|,\n2. D is in stratified general position with respect to \u2206 (in particular, dim(\u2206\u22121 (|D|)) \u2264\ni + n and dim(\u2206\u22121 (|\u2202D|)) \u2264 i + n \u2212 1), and\n3. dim(\u2206\u22121 (|D|) \u2229 \u03a3X ) \u2264 i + n \u2212 2, and dim(\u2206\u22121 (|\u2202D|) \u2229 \u03a3X ) \u2264 i + n \u2212 3\nThen the chains in S \u2212nk C\u2217\u2206 (X(k)) satisfy all of the conditions outlined above for there to\nbe a well-defined degree 0 chain homomorphism \u2206! : S \u2212nk C\u2217\u2206 (X(k)) \u2192 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X) defined\nby taking the chain D to the homology class [D] \u2208 S \u2212nk Hi+nk (|D|, |\u2202D|) and then applying\nthe composition\nS \u2212nk Hi+nk (|D|, |\u2202D|) \u2192 S \u2212n Hi+n (f \u22121 (|D|), f \u22121(|\u2202D|)) \u2192 S \u2212n Ci+n (X),\nwhere the first map is the composition described in diagram (4) and the second map makes\nuse of the natural isomorphism between homology classes and chains recalled at the beginning\nof this subsection.\nDefinition 4.3. The morphism \u2206! : S \u2212nk C\u2217\u2206 (X(k)) \u2192 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X) is a pseudomanifold\nversion of a special case of the classical transfer or umkehr map. See [7, 20] for more details.\nWe show in Appendix A that \u2206! is indeed a chain map, and we also show there that the\ncorresponding transfers f! : S \u2212m C\u2217f (M) \u2192 S \u2212n C\u2217 (N) of [20] are chain maps, where M m , N n\nare PL manifolds, f is a PL map, and C\u2217f (M) is the chain complex of chains in general\nposition with respect to f - see [20].\nDefinition 4.4. Suppose P = {p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k } is a sequence of traditional perversities and that\np\u03041 + * * * + p\u0304k \u2264 r\u0304 for some traditional perversity r\u0304. Then we let \u03bck = \u2206! \u25e6 \u03b5\u0304k : GPk,\u2217 \u2192\nS \u2212n C\u2217 (X). Note that \u03bc1 is the identity.\nWe demonstrate in the following proposition that \u03bck is well-defined on appropriate GPk\nand that its image lies in S \u2212n I r\u0304 C\u2217 (X).\nProposition 4.5. Suppose P = {p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k } is a sequence of traditional perversities and\nthat p\u03041 + * * * + p\u0304k \u2264 r\u0304 for some traditional perversity r\u0304. Then \u03bck determines a well-defined\nchain map (of degree 0) GPk \u2192 S \u2212n IC\u2217r\u0304 (X).\nProof. Suppose C \u2208 (GPk )i . We must show that \u03b5\u0304k (C) \u2208 S \u2212nk C\u2217\u2206 (X(k)) so that \u03bck is welldefined, and we must check that \u2206! \u03b5\u0304k (C) is in S \u2212n I r\u0304 C\u2217 (X). In particular, we must verify\nthe three conditions of definition 4.2. But by definition of GPk , \u03b5\u0304k (C) is in general position\nwith respect to \u2206, so the second condition is satisfied automatically. The first condition is\nalso trivial since |\u03be| \u2229 \u03a3 \u2282 |\u2202\u03be| \u2229 \u03a3 for any intersection chain, and this implies the same for\ntheir products.\nNow, C is represented by a chain in \u2295j1 +***+jk =i (S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217 (X))j1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 (S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217 (X))jk .\nP\nThus if I is a k-component multi-index, C breaks into a unique sum |I|=i CI , where each\nP\nCI lies in a separate (S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217 (X))j1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 (S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217 (X))jk with ki=1 ji = i. We know\nthat \u03b5\u0304k (C) \u2208 S \u2212nk C\u2217 (X(k)), and since \u2206 is the generalized diagonal, \u2206\u22121 (|\u03b5\u0304k C|) = |\u03b5\u0304k (C)| \u2229\n\u2206(X). Moreover, for each stratum X\u03ba , \u2206\u22121 (X(k)) \u2229 X\u03ba \u223c\n= \u2206(X\u03ba ) \u2282 X\u03ba (k).\n24\n\n\fFurthermore, for each multi-index I = {j1 , . . . , jk }, each (S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217 (X))j1 \u2297* * *\u2297(S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217 (X))jk\nis generated by chains S \u2212n \u03bea1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n \u03beak , where each \u03beal is a p\u0304l allowable chain.

Since3 r\u0304(n \u2212 \u03ba) \u2264 n \u2212 \u03ba \u2212 2, it follows that dim(\u2206\u22121 (|\u03b5\u0304k CI |) \u2229 \u03a3X ) \u2264 i + n \u2212 2. Thus\ndim(\u2206\u22121 (|\u03b5\u0304k C|) \u2229 \u03a3X ) \u2264 i + n \u2212 2. The same argument with \u2202C (which of course must be\nbroken up into a different sum of tensor products of chains) shows that dim(\u2206\u22121 (|\u2202 \u03b5\u0304k C|) \u2229\n\u03a3X ) \u2264 i + n \u2212 3. Thus \u03b5\u0304k C satisfies all the conditions of Definition 4.2 and so lies in\nS \u2212nk C\u2217\u2206 (X(k)). It follows that \u03bck (C) is well-defined in S \u2212n C\u2217 (X).\nMoreover, since \u03b5\u0304(C) is an i-chain in GPk , the construction tells us that \u03bck (C) will be\nan i-chain in S \u2212n C\u2217 (X), and thus it is represented by S \u2212n \u039e for some i + n chain \u039e. The\npreceding calculation shows that dim(|\u039e| \u2229 X\u03ba ) = dim(|\u03bck (C)| \u2229 X\u03ba ) \u2264 i + \u03ba + r\u0304(n \u2212 \u03ba) =\n(i + n) \u2212 (n \u2212 \u03ba) + r\u0304(n \u2212 \u03ba), and thus \u039e is r\u0304-allowable. The same argument shows that\n\u2202\u039e is r\u0304 allowable, so \u03bck (C) \u2208 (S \u2212n I r\u0304 C\u2217 (X))i . Note, however, that we cannot restrict\nthe entire argument to primitives in the tensor product, as these might not lie in GPk ;\ncancellation of boundary terms from different primitives is possible. Thus in considering\n3\n\nObserve that it is critical here that r\u0304 is a traditional perversity.\n\n25\n\n\f\u2202C, the maximum occurring in the last set of inequalities must occur over primitives that\nappear in \u2202C altogether, not over boundary terms of individual primitives appearing in C.\nIt is straightforward that \u03bck is a chain map since \u03b5\u0304 and \u2206! are and since the dimension\nconditions we have checked will hold for a sum of chains once they hold for each summand\nindividually.\nCorollary 4.6. Suppose P = {p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k } is a sequence of traditional perversities and that\np\u03041 + * * * + p\u0304k \u2264 r\u0304 for some traditional perversity r\u0304. Then there is a well-defined product (of\ndegree 0) \u03bck\u2217 : S \u2212n IH\u2217p\u03041 (X) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S \u2212n IH\u2217p\u0304k (X) \u2192 S \u2212n IH r\u0304 (X).\nProof. We can consider an element of S \u2212n IH\u2217p\u03041 (X) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S \u2212n IH\u2217p\u0304k (X) to be an element of\nS \u2212n IH\u2217p\u03041 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n IH\u2217p\u0304k (X). The corollary then follows from the proposition since\nGPk is quasi-isomorphic to S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u03041 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u0304k (X) by Theorem 3.5 and since\nS \u2212n IH\u2217p\u03041 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n IH\u2217p\u0304k (X) is a subgroup of H\u2217 (S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u03041 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n IC\u2217p\u0304k (X)) by\nthe K\u00fcnneth Theorem.\nRemark 4.7. Since \u2206 is a proper map, these considerations may be extended to noncompact oriented pseudomanifolds. In this case, if we continue to desire to study chains with\ncompact supports, we simply replace the cohomology groups that occur in the above definition with the cohomology groups with compact supports, utilizing that version of Poincar\u00e9\nduality. There is no problem with the map \u2206\u2217 since \u2206 is proper. If we wish instead to\nconsider locally-finite chains, we use the ordinary cohomology groups, but the Borel-Moore\nhomology.4 Observe in this setting that if |C| is not necessarily compact but \u2206\u22121 (|C|) is,\nthen Hic (\u2206\u22121 (|C|) \u222a \u03a3X , \u2206\u22121 (|\u2202C|) \u222a \u03a3X ) \u223c\n= Hi\u221e (\u2206\u22121 (|C|) \u222a \u03a3X , \u2206\u22121 (|\u2202C|) \u222a \u03a3X ), as follows\nfrom an excision argument. We also note that, in the case of locally-finite chains, we can\nfunctorially restrict to open subsets U of X to get a map\nS \u2212nk H\u2217\u221e (|C| \u2229 U(k), |\u2202C| \u2229 U(k)) \u2192 S \u2212n H\u2217\u221e (\u2206\u22121 (|C|) \u2229 U, \u2206\u22121 (|\u2202C|) \u2229 U).\nRemark 4.8. The transfer map discussed here can also be generalized to appropriate stratified\nmaps f : X \u2192 Y between oriented stratified PL pseudomanifolds in order to obtain a transfer\nf! from subcomplexes of intersection chain complexes of Y satisfying appropriate stratified\ngeneral position conditions to intersection chain complexes of X. Since we do not need such\ngenerality here, we do not investigate the relevant details.\n\n4.3\n\nComparison with Goresky-MacPherson product\n\nIn this section, we study the compatibility between the intersection product \u03bck and the\nGoresky-MacPherson intersection product of [12] for those instances when our element of\nGPk can be written as a product of chains in stratified general position. Recall that we have\nintroduced a sign in the Poincar\u00e9-Whitehead-Goresky-MacPherson duality map; see Section\n4\n\nSee [23] for an exposition of the relevant duality theorems. These theorems are stated there for manifolds,\nbut we can adapt to the current situations by thickening the singular sets to their regular neighborhoods\nand employing some excision arguments and standard manifold doubling techniques.\n\n26\n\n\f4.1. We first consider the case k = 2 and then generalize to more terms. This will require\nus to demonstrate that iteration of the Goresky-MacPherson product is well-defined.\nWe first show that, when k = 2, our product is the Goresky-MacPherson intersection\nproduct, in those cases where the Goresky-MacPherson product is defined, in particular for\ntwo chain in appropriate stratified general position [12]. In order to avoid confusion with the\ncap product, we denote the Goresky-MacPherson pairing by \u22d4, though this symbol is used\nfor a somewhat different, but related, purpose in [12].\nProposition 4.9. Suppose that C \u2208 ICip\u0304 (X) and D \u2208 I q\u0304 Cj (X) are two chains in stratified\ngeneral position, that \u2202C and D are in stratified general position, and that C and \u2202D are in\nstratified general position. Suppose p\u0304 + q\u0304 \u2264 r\u0304, where r\u0304 is also a traditional perversity. Then\nS n \u03bc2 (S \u2212n C \u2297 S \u2212n D) = C \u22d4 D.\nProof of Proposition 4.9. Let C and D be the indicated chains. We note that two chains\nbeing in stratified general position is the same thing as their product under \u03b5\u0304 being in\nstratified general position with respect to \u2206 : X \u2192 X \u00d7X. We trace through the definitions.\nRecall the definition of the Goresky-MacPherson product: C \u00d7D represents an element of\nHi (|C|, |\u2202C|) \u00d7 Hj (|D|, |\u2202D|), which is taken to an element, represented by the same pair of\nchains, of Hi (|C| \u222a J, J) \u00d7 Hj (|D| \u222a J, J), where J = |\u2202C| \u222a |\u2202D| \u222a \u03a3X . Next one applies the\ninverse to the Poincar\u00e9-Whitehead-Goresky-MacPherson duality isomorphism represented\nby the (signed!) inverse to the cap product with the fundamental class. Let \u0393 denote the\nfundamental class of X, and let \u03a5 = (\u2229\u0393)\u22121 , which acts on the right as for cap products.\nFor a constructible pair (B, A) \u2282 X with B \u2212 A \u2282 X \u2212 \u03a3, \u03a5 is a well-defined isomorphism\nHi (X \u2212 A, X \u2212 B) \u2192 H n\u2212i (B, A); see [12, Section 7]. The Goresky-MacPherson product is\nrepresented, up to excisions, by the chain\n(((\u22121)n(n\u2212i) [C]\u03a5) \u222a ((\u22121)n(n\u2212j) [D]\u03a5)) \u2229 \u0393(\u22121)n(n\u2212i+n\u2212j) = (([C]\u03a5) \u222a ([D]\u03a5)) \u2229 \u0393\nin Hi+j\u2212n (|C| \u2229 |D|, (|\u2202C| \u2229 |D|) \u222a (|C| \u2229 |\u2202D|)) (see [12, Section 2.1]). Note that the sign\nwe have introduced in the Poincar\u00e9 duality map does not affect the sign of the GoreskyMacPherson product \u22d4.\nLet \u03a52 denote the inverse of \u2229(\u0393 \u00d7 \u0393), which induces the Poincar\u00e9-Whitehead-GoreskyMacPherson duality isomorphisms on the pseudomanifold X\u2297X. The image of S \u2212n C\u00d7S \u2212n D\nunder \u03bc2 , as defined above, is represented by\nS \u2212n (\u2206\u2217 ((\u03b5\u0304(S \u2212n C \u2297 S \u2212n D))\u03a52(\u22121)2n(2n\u2212i\u2212j) ) \u2229 \u0393(\u22121)n(2n\u2212i\u2212j)\n= S \u2212n (\u2206\u2217 ((\u03b5\u0304(S \u2212n C \u2297 S \u2212n D))\u03a52 )) \u2229 \u0393(\u22121)n(\u2212i\u2212j)\n= (\u22121)n(\u2212i\u2212j) S \u2212n (\u2206\u2217 ((\u22121)n\n\n2 +ni\n\nS \u2212n (C \u00d7 D))\u03a52 )) \u2229 \u0393\n\n= (\u22121)n(n\u2212j) S \u2212n (\u2206\u2217 ((S \u2212n (C \u00d7 D))\u03a52 )) \u2229 \u0393.\nThe second equality comes from the definition of \u03b5\u0304.\nIn order to make the comparison with the Goresky-MacPherson product more precise,\nnotice that, by excision isomorphisms, we can also describe \u03bc2 , by (\u22121)n(n\u2212j) times the\ncomposition\n27\n\n\fHi+j (|C \u00d7 D|, |\u2202(C \u00d7 D)|) \u2192 Hi+j (|C \u00d7 D|, |\u2202(C \u00d7 D) \u2229 ((J \u00d7 X) \u222a (X \u00d7 J)))\n\u223c\n= Hi+j (|C \u00d7 D| \u222a ((J \u00d7 X) \u222a (X \u00d7 J)), ((J \u00d7 X) \u222a (X \u00d7 J)))\n\u03a52\n\n\u223c\n= H 2n\u2212i\u2212j (X \u00d7 X \u2212 ((J \u00d7 X) \u222a (X \u00d7 J)),\nX \u00d7 X \u2212 |C \u00d7 D| \u222a ((J \u00d7 X) \u222a (X \u00d7 J)))\n\n\u2206\u2217\n\n\u2192 H 2n\u2212i\u2212j (X \u2212 J, X \u2212 |C \u2229 D| \u222a J)\n\u2229\u0393\n\n\u223c\n= Hi+j\u2212n (|C \u2229 D| \u222a J, J)\n\u223c\n= Hi+j\u2212n (|C \u2229 D|, |(|\u2202C| \u2229 |D|) \u222a (|C| \u2229 |\u2202D|)),\nfollowed by the shift to put the associated chain in S \u2212n Ci+j (X).\nIgnoring the shifts, which we may do at this point without disrupting any signs, it\ntherefore suffices to compare \u2206\u2217 ([C \u00d7D]\u03a52 ) with ([C]\u03a5)\u222a([D]\u03a5) in H 2n\u2212i\u2212j (X \u2212J, X \u2212|C \u2229\nD| \u222a J). The usual formula for the cup product says that the latter is equal to \u2206\u2217 ([C]\u03a5 \u00d7\n[D]\u03a5), where this \u00d7 denotes the cochain cross product. So we compare [C \u00d7 D]\u03a52 with\n[C]\u03a5 \u00d7[D]\u03a5 in H 2n\u2212i\u2212j (X \u00d7X \u2212((J \u00d7X) \u222a(X \u00d7J)), X \u00d7X \u2212|C \u00d7D| \u222a((J \u00d7X) \u222a(X \u00d7J))).\nTaking the cap product with \u0393 \u00d7 \u0393 of the former gives [C \u00d7 D] = [C] \u00d7 [D] \u2208 Hi+j (|C \u00d7 D| \u222a\n((J \u00d7 X) \u222a (X \u00d7 J)), ((J \u00d7 X) \u222a (X \u00d7 J))) (which corresponds to the homology cross product\nof C and D), while taking this cap product with [C]\u03a5 \u00d7 [D]\u03a5 gives (\u22121)n(n\u2212j) ([C]\u03a5 \u2229 \u0393) \u00d7\n([D]\u03a5 \u2229 \u0393) = (\u22121)n(n\u2212j) [C] \u00d7 [D] \u2208 Hi+j (|C \u00d7 D| \u222a ((J \u00d7 X) \u222a (X \u00d7 J)), ((J \u00d7 X) \u222a (X \u00d7 J)))\n(see [3, Theorem 5.4] ).\nThus the sign (\u22121)n(n\u2212j) appears twice, so they cancel, completing the proof.\nRemark 4.10. In the computations that follow, for the sake of simplicity of notation, we\nsuppress the excisions and allow appropriate chains and cochains to stand for the elements\nof the respective homology and cohomology groups such as those considered in the preceding proof. Each computation could be performed in more detail by modeling the above\narguments more closely.\nCorollary 4.11. Suppose P = {p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k } is a sequence of traditional perversities and that\np\u03041 +* * *+ p\u0304k \u2264 r\u0304 for some traditional perversity r\u0304. Then if Di \u2208 I p\u0304i C\u2217 (X) and (\u2297ki=1 S \u2212n Di ) \u2208\nGPk , the product S n \u03bck (\u2297ki=1 S \u2212n Di ) \u2208 IC\u2217r\u0304 (X) is equal to the iterated Goresky-MacPherson\nintersection product of the chains Di .\nBefore proving the corollary, we must first demonstrate that iterating the GoreskyMacPherson intersection pairing is even possible in consideration of the necessary perversity\ncompatibilities. This is the goal of the following lemmas.\nDefinition 4.12. Let an n-perversity be a (traditional Goresky-MacPherson) perversity\nwhose domain is restricted to integers 2 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n.\nLemma 4.13. Let p\u0304 and q\u0304 be two n-perversities such that there exists an n-perversity r\u0304 with\np\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba) \u2264 r\u0304(\u03ba) for all 2 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n. There there exists a unique minimal perversity s\u0304\nsuch p\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba) \u2264 s\u0304(\u03ba) for all 2 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n. (By minimal, we mean that for any r\u0304 such that\np\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba) \u2264 r\u0304(\u03ba) for all 2 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n, r\u0304(\u03ba) \u2265 s\u0304(\u03ba).)\n28\n\n\fProof. We construct s\u0304 inductively as follows: Let s\u0304(n) = p\u0304(n) + q\u0304(n). For each \u03ba < n\n(working backwards from n \u2212 1 to 2): if p\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba) < s\u0304(\u03ba + 1), let s\u0304(\u03ba) = s\u0304(\u03ba + 1) \u2212 1; and\nif p\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba) = s\u0304(\u03ba + 1), let s\u0304(\u03ba) = s\u0304(\u03ba + 1). We note that by construction we must always\nhave s\u0304(\u03ba) \u2265 p\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba), and it is clear that s\u0304 is minimal with respect to this property among\nall functions f \u0304 satisfying f \u0304(\u03ba) \u2264 f \u0304(\u03ba + 1) \u2264 f \u0304(\u03ba) + 1 (for all \u03ba, s\u0304(\u03ba) is as low as possible to\nstill be able to \"clear the jumps\"). s\u0304 is certainly a perversity, provided that s\u0304(2) = 0, but\nthis must be the case since we know that p\u0304 + q\u0304 \u2264 s\u0304 \u2264 r\u0304, and r\u0304(2) = p\u0304(2) = q\u0304(2) = 0.\nDefinition 4.14. Given the situation of the preceding lemma, we will call s\u0304 the minimal\nn-perversity over p\u0304 and q\u0304.\nLemma 4.15. Let p\u0304 and q\u0304 be two n-perversities and let f \u0304 : {2, . . . , n} \u2192 N be a nondecreasing function such that p\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba) + f \u0304(\u03ba) \u2264 r\u0304(\u03ba) for some n-perversity r\u0304 and for all\n2 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n. Let s\u0304(\u03ba) be the minimal n-perversity over p\u0304 and q\u0304. Then s\u0304(\u03ba) + f \u0304(\u03ba) \u2264 r\u0304(\u03ba).\nProof. Since s\u0304(n) = p\u0304(n) + q\u0304(n) (see the proof of Lemma 4.13), we have s\u0304(n) + f \u0304(n) \u2264\nr\u0304(n). Suppose now that s\u0304(\u03ba + 1) + f \u0304(\u03ba + 1) \u2264 r\u0304(\u03ba + 1) for some \u03ba, 2 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n \u2212 1. If\np\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba) < s\u0304(\u03ba + 1), then s\u0304(\u03ba) = s\u0304(\u03ba + 1) \u2212 1, and we must have s\u0304(\u03ba) + f \u0304(\u03ba) \u2264 r\u0304(\u03ba) since\nr\u0304(\u03ba) \u2265 r\u0304(\u03ba + 1) \u2212 1. If p\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba) = s\u0304(\u03ba + 1), then s\u0304(\u03ba) = s\u0304(\u03ba + 1) = p\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba), and\nso again s\u0304(\u03ba) + f \u0304(\u03ba) \u2264 r\u0304(\u03ba), this time by hypothesis. The proof is complete by induction,\nnoting that we cannot have p\u0304(\u03ba) + q\u0304(\u03ba) > s\u0304(\u03ba + 1).\nP\nProposition 4.16. Let P = {p\u0304j }kj=1 be a collection of n-perversities such that kj=1 p\u0304j (\u03ba) \u2264\nr\u0304(\u03ba) for all 2 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 n and for some n-perversity r\u0304. Let X be an oriented n-dimensional\npseudomanifold. Let Dj \u2208 I p\u0304j Cij (X), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k be such that \u2297kj=1 S \u2212n Dj \u2208 GPk . Then\nthe iterated Goresky-MacPherson intersection product of the Dj is a well-defined element\nof I r\u0304 C\u2212n(k\u22121)+P ij (X), independent of arrangement of parentheses. In particular, there is\nQ\np\u0304\nr\u0304\nP (X) independent of arrangement of\na well-defined product kj=1 IHijj (X) \u2192 IH\u2212n(k\u22121)+\nij\nparentheses.\nProof. By [12], if D1 \u2208 I p\u0304 Ca and D2 \u2208 I q\u0304 Cb are in stratified general position and the\nboundary of D1 is in stratified general position with respect to D2 and vice versa, then there\nis a well-defined intersection product D1 \u22d4 D2 \u2208 I \u016b Ca+b\u2212n (X) whenever p\u0304 + q\u0304 \u2264 \u016b. It follows\np\u0304C\nfrom the preceding lemma that for any pair Dil \u00d7 Dil +1 \u2208 ICip\u0304ll (X) \u00d7 Iil+1l+1 (X) such that\nDil and Dil +1 satisfy the necessary general position requirements, there is a well-defined\npairing to I s\u0304 Cil +il+1 \u2212n (X), where s\u0304 is the minimal n-perversity over p\u0304 and q\u0304. Since, by\nP\nthe lemma, s\u0304(\u03ba) + j6=l,l+1 p\u0304j (\u03ba) is still \u2264 r\u0304(\u03ba), we can iterate the Goresky-MacPherson\nintersection product to obtain an m-fold intersection product so long as Dil \u22d4 Dil +1 is in\nstratified general position (including the general position conditions on the boundaries) with\nwhichever chain it will be intersected with next. But the condition \u2297S \u2212n Di \u2208 GPk precisely\nguarantees that such general position will be maintained, even amongst combined sets of\nintersection (for any given surjective R and any i 6= j, the intersection of the chains indexed\nby R\u22121 (i) and the intersection of the chains indexed by R\u22121 (j) will be in stratified general\nposition by definition of GPk ). Thus iteration is allowed.\n29\n\n\fThe claim that this gives an iterated pairing on IH follows immediately given that any\ntwo intersection cycles can be pushed into stratified general position within their homology\nclasses - see [12]. The claim concerning independence of ordering of parentheses is the claim\nthat the the Goresky-MacPherson pairing is associative when the iterated pairing is welldefined. But this follows directly from the definition of the Goresky-MacPherson pairing\nand the associativity of the cup product: As noted in the proof above of Proposition 4.9,\nC \u22d4 D is represented by ([C]\u03a5 \u222a [D]\u03a5) \u2229 \u0393 (we drop the signs in the duality isomorphisms\nsince they cancel in the definition of \u22d4 - see the proof of Proposition 4.9). So the iterated\nproduct of C, D, and E looks like\n([C] \u22d4 [D]) \u22d4 [E] = ((([C]\u03a5 \u222a [D]\u03a5) \u2229 \u0393)\u03a5 \u222a [E]\u03a5) \u2229 \u0393\n= (([C]\u03a5 \u222a [D]\u03a5) \u222a [E]\u03a5) \u2229 \u0393\n= ([C]\u03a5 \u222a ([D]\u03a5 \u222a [E]\u03a5) \u2229 \u0393\n= ([C]\u03a5 \u222a (([D]\u03a5 \u222a \u03a5[E]) \u2229 \u0393)\u03a5 \u2229 \u0393\n= [C] \u22d4 ([D] \u22d4 [E]).\nNote that in defining any of these products, we may use J = |\u2202C| \u222a |\u2202D| \u222a |\u2202E| \u222a \u03a3\n(see the proof of Proposition 4.9). Enlarging J in this way will not interfere with the\nnecessary excisions since, for example, having S \u2212n C \u2297 S \u2212n D \u2297 S \u2212n E \u2282 GP3 implies that\nS \u2212n \u2202E is in general position with respect to S \u2212n C \u2229 S \u2212n D. Thus dim(|\u2202E| \u2229 |C| \u2229 |D|) <\ndim(|C|) + dim(|D|) \u2212 n.\nCorollary 4.17. \u03bc2 satisfies \u03bc2 (\u03bc2 (S \u2212n A\u2297S \u2212n B)\u2297S \u2212n C) = \u03bc2 (S \u2212n A\u2297\u03bc2 (S \u2212n B \u2297S \u2212n C))\nwhen these expressions are all well-defined.\nProof. This follows from the preceding proposition and Proposition 4.9.\nNext, we compare how \u03bck relates to the iteration of two products \u03bck1 and \u03bck2 with\nk1 + k1 = k.\nLemma 4.18. Let k = k1 + k2 . Let p\u0304a , 1 \u2264 a \u2264 k1 , and p\u0304k1 +b , 1 \u2264 b \u2264 k2 be collections\nP1\nP2\nof n-perversities such that ka=1\np\u0304a \u2264 q\u03041 and kb=1\np\u0304k1 +b \u2264 q\u03042 for perversities q\u03041 , q\u03042 . Suppose\nq\u03041 + q\u03042 \u2264 r\u0304 for a perversity r\u0304. Let P = (p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k ). Suppose C = S \u2212n D1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n Dk is\nan element of GPk , and let C1 = S \u2212n D1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n Dk1 and C2 = S \u2212n Dk1 +1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n Dk .\nThen\n\u03bck (C) = \u03bc2 (\u03bck1 (C1 ) \u2297 \u03bck2 (C2 )).\nIn particular, \u03bck (C) = \u03bc2 (\u03bck\u22121 (S \u2212n D1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n Dk\u22121 ) \u2297 S \u2212n Dk ).\nProof. We first note that the righthand side of the desired equality is well defined since the\nstratified general position requirements for any element of GPk imply that for any S \u2212n D1 \u2297\n* * *\u2297S \u2212n Dk \u2208 GPk and any disjoint subcollection I, J \u2282 {1, . . . k} then \u2229i\u2208I |Di | and \u2229j\u2208J |Dj |\nare in stratified general position with respect to each other (and similarly for the necessary collections involving the \u2202Di ). This can be seen by using the function R : k\u0304 \u0589\n30\n\n\fk \u2212 |I| \u2212 |J| + 2 that takes I to 1, J to 2, and maps all other indices injectively. (Of course,\nwe cannot in general split an element of GPk into an element of GPk11 \u2297 GPk22 , but the element\nC has an especially simple form.)\nLet \u2206k : X \u0592\u2192 X(k) be the diagonal embedding, let \u0393 be the orientation class of X, let\n\u0393k = \u03b5k (\u0393 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u0393) = \u0393 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393, and let \u03a5k be the inverse Poincar\u00e9-Whitehead-GoreskyP\nMacPherson duality isomorphism to the cap product with \u0393k . Let l = i dim(Di ). Then by\ndefinition, \u03bck (C) is represented by S \u2212n (\u2206\u2217k ([\u03b5\u0304k C]\u03a5k (\u22121)nk(nk\u2212l)) \u2229 \u0393(\u22121)n(nk\u2212l) . Similarly,\nP1\nP\nletting l1 = ki=1\ndim(Di ) and l2 = ki=k1 +1 Di , then \u03bc2 (\u03bck1 (C1 ) \u2297 \u03bck2 (C2 )) is represented\nby\nS \u2212n (\u2206\u22172 ((\u03b5\u03042 (S \u2212n ((\u2206\u2217k1 ([\u03b5\u0304k1 C1 ]\u03a5k1 (\u22121)nk1 (nk1 \u2212l1 ) )) \u2229 \u0393(\u22121)n(nk1 \u2212l1 ) )\n\n(5)\n\n\u2297 S \u2212n ((\u2206\u2217k2 ([\u03b5\u0304k2 C2 ]\u03a5k2 (\u22121)nk2 (nk2 \u2212l2 ) )) \u2229 \u0393(\u22121)n(nk2 \u2212l2 ) )))\u03a52 (\u22121)2n(nk\u2212l) )) \u2229 \u0393(\u22121)n(nk\u2212l)\nWorking mod 2, the total power of the sign in this expression becomes \u22121 to the\nnk1 (nk1 \u2212 l1 ) + n(nk1 \u2212 l1 ) + nk2 (nk2 \u2212 l2 ) + n(nk2 \u2212 l2 ) + 2n(nk \u2212 l) + n(nk \u2212 l)\n\u2261 nk1 \u2212 nk1 l1 + nk1 + nl1 + nk2 + nk2 l2 + nk2 + nl2 + nk + nl\n\u2261 nk1 l1 + nk2 l2 + nk\nsince l1 + l2 = l.\nSince both of the formulas have the form S \u2212n (*) \u2229 \u0393, we can compare\n\u2206\u22172 ((\u03b5\u03042 (S \u2212n ((\u2206\u2217k1 ([\u03b5\u0304k1 C1 ]\u03a5k1 )) \u2229 \u0393) \u2297 S \u2212n ((\u2206\u2217k2 ([\u03b5\u0304k2 C2 ]\u03a5k2 )) \u2229 \u0393)))\u03a52 )\nwith \u2206\u2217k ([\u03b5\u0304C]\u03a5k ).\nWe compute\n\u2206\u22172 ((\u03b5\u03042 (S \u2212n ((\u2206\u2217k1 ([\u03b5\u0304k1 C1 ]\u03a5k1 )) \u2229 \u0393) \u2297 S \u2212n ((\u2206\u2217k2 ([\u03b5\u0304k2 C2 ]\u03a5k2 )) \u2229 \u0393)))\u03a52 )\n= (\u22121)\n\nn2 +n(n+l\n\n= (\u22121)\n\nn2 +n(n+l\n\n1 \u2212nk1 )\n\n(6)\n\n\u2206\u22172 ((S \u22122n ((\u2206\u2217k1 ([\u03b5\u0304k1 C1 ]\u03a5k1 )) \u2229 \u0393) \u00d7 ((\u2206\u2217k2 ([\u03b5\u0304k2 C2 ]\u03a5k2 )) \u2229 \u0393))\u03a52 )\ndef. of \u03b5\u03042\n\n1 \u2212nk1 )+n(nk2 \u2212l2 )\n\n\u2206\u22172 ((S \u22122n ((\u2206\u2217k1 ([\u03b5\u0304k1 C1 ]\u03a5k1 )) \u00d7 (\u2206\u2217k2 ([\u03b5\u0304k2 C2 ]\u03a5k2 ))) \u2229 \u03932 \u03a52 ))\npulling \u2229\u0393 across\n\n= (\u22121)n\n\n2 +n(n+l\n\n1 \u2212nk1 )+n(nk2 \u2212l2 )\n\n\u2206\u22172 (((\u2206\u2217k1 ([\u03b5\u0304k1 C1 ]\u03a5k1 )) \u00d7 (\u2206\u2217k2 ([\u03b5\u0304k2 C2 ]\u03a5k2 ))))\ncancellation of \u03a52 and \u2229\u03932\n\n= (\u22121)\n\nn2 +n(n+l\n\n1 \u2212nk1 )+n(nk2 \u2212l2 )\n\n\u2206\u22172 (\u2206\u2217k1 \u00d7 \u2206\u2217k2 )(([\u03b5\u0304k1 C1 ]\u03a5k1 ) \u00d7 ([\u03b5\u0304k2 C2 ]\u03a5k2 ))\n\n2 +n(n+l\n\n1 \u2212nk1 )+n(nk2 \u2212l2 )\n\n\u2206\u2217k (([\u03b5\u0304k1 C1 ]\u03a5k1 ) \u00d7 ([\u03b5\u0304k2 C2 ]\u03a5k2 )),\n\n= (\u22121)n\n\nsince (\u2206k1 \u00d7 \u2206k2 ) \u25e6 \u22062 = \u2206k .

Now suppose we\ninclude the signs that make \u03a5 the inverse to the Poincar\u00e9 duality morphism. In other words,\nwe look at ([\u03b5\u0304k1 C1 ]\u03a5k1 )(\u22121)nk1 (nk1 \u2212l1 ) \u00d7 ([\u03b5\u0304k2 C2 ]\u03a5k1 )(\u22121)nk2 (nk2 \u2212l2 ) . Then by Lemma 7.2 in\nAppendix A, this is equivalent to the cochain product of the individual inverse Poincar\u00e9\nduals of the individual chains. In other words, this is equal to (S \u2212n D1 )\u03a51 (\u22121)n(n\u2212|D1 |) \u00d7\n* * * \u00d7 (S \u2212n Dk )\u03a51 (\u22121)n(n\u2212|Dk |) , which, again by Lemma 7.2, is equal to \u03b5\u0304k (C)\u03a5k (\u22121)nk(nk\u2212l) .\nThus\n([\u03b5\u0304k1 C1 ]\u03a5k1 ) \u00d7 ([\u03b5\u0304k2 C2 ]\u03a5k1 ) = (\u22121)nk1 (nk1 \u2212l1 )+nk1 (nk2 \u2212l2 )+nk(nk\u2212l) [\u03b5\u0304k C]\u03a5k .\n(7)\nThis sign simplifies to \u22121 to the nk1 l1 + nk2 l2 + nkl.\nNow, the total power of \u22121 in the expression (5) for \u03bc2 (\u03bck1 (C1 ) \u2297 \u03bck2 (C2 )) is nk1 l1 +\nnk2 l2 + nk, the power of \u22121 from the computation (6) is nl + nk, and the power of \u22121 from\nequation (7) is nk1 l1 + nk2 l2 + nkl. Mod 2, these add to nkl + nl, which is indeed equivalent\nmod 2 to the power of \u22121 in the expression for \u03bck (C) with which we started. The lemma\nfollows.\nLemma 4.19.

This follows directly from the preceding lemma and induction.\nProof of Corollary 4.11. Let Ci = S \u2212n Di . Since the Goresky-MacPherson pairing is associative, as noted in the proof of Proposition 4.16, the arrangement of parentheses is immaterial,\nand we can use the grouping of the last lemma to consider ((* * * ((D1 \u22d4 D2 ) \u22d4 D3 ) \u22d4 * * * ) \u22d4\nDk\u22121 ) \u22d4 Dk . By using Proposition 4.9, repeatedly, this is equal to S n \u03bc2 (\u03bc2 (* * * \u03bc2 (C1 \u2297 C2 ) \u2297\nC3 ) \u2297 * * * Ck ), which, by the preceding lemma, is equal to S n \u03bck (C1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Ck ).\n\n5\n\nThe Leinster partial algebra structure\n\nIn this section, we collect the technical definitions concerning partial commutative DGAs\nand partial restricted commutative DGAs. Then we show that this is what we have, proving\nTheorem 1.1, which was described in the introduction.\nThe following definition without perversity restrictions originates from Leinster in [18,\nSection 2.2], where the structures are referred to as homotopy algebras. We follow McClure\nin [20], where they are called partially defined DGAs or Leinster partial DGAs.\nWe continue to let k\u0304 = {1, . . . , k} for k \u2265 1 and 0\u0304 = \u2205. Let \u03a6 be the full subcategory of\nSet consisting of the sets k\u0304, k \u2265 0. Note that disjoint union gives a functor \u2210 : \u03a6 \u00d7 \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6\ndetermined by k\u0304 \u2210  \u0304l = k + l. Given a functor A with domain category \u03a6, we denote A(k\u0304)\nby Ak .\nDefinition 5.1. (Leinster-McClure) A Leinster partial commutative DGA is a functor A\nfrom \u03a6 to the category Ch of chain complexes together with chain maps\n\u03bek,l : Ak+l \u2192 Ak \u2297 Al\n32\n\n\ffor each k, l and\n\u03be0 : A0 \u2192 Z[0],\nwhere Z[0] \u2208 Ch is the chain complex with a single Z term in degree 0, such that the\nfollowing conditions hold:\n1.

Notice the slightly subtle point that\nthe intersection product itself is encoded in the fact that G is a functor. Thus, for example,\nwe have a map Gk \u2192 G1 = S \u2212n C\u2217 (M), and this is precisely the intersection product coming\nfrom the umkehr map \u2206k! .\nFor the intersection of intersection chains in a PL pseudomanifold, we must generalize to\nthe notion of a partial restricted commutative DGA. In this setting, the intersection pairing\nrequires not just general position but compatibility among perversities. The appropriate\ngeneralized definition was suggested by Jim McClure and refined by Mark Hovey.\nFix a non-negative integer n, we define a perverse chain complex to be a functor from\nthe poset category Pn of n-perversities to the category Ch of chain complexes. The objects\nof Pn are n-perversities as defined in Definition 4.12, and there is a unique morphism q\u0304 \u2192 p\u0304\nif q\u0304(k) \u2264 p\u0304(k) for all k, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n. We denote a perverse chain complex by {D\u2217\u22c6 }. The \u22c6 is\nmeant to indicate the input variable for perversities, and we write evaluation as {D\u2217\u22c6 }p\u0304 = D\u2217p\u0304\nor {D\u2217\u22c6 }p\u0304i = Dip\u0304\nThis yields a category PChn of n-perverse chain complexes whose morphisms consist\nof natural transformations of such functors. Explicitly, given two perverse chain complexes\n{D\u2217\u22c6 } and {E\u2217\u22c6 }, a morphism of perverse chain complexes consists of chain maps D\u2217p\u0304 \u2192 E\u2217p\u0304\nfor each perversity p\u0304 together with commutative diagrams\nD\u2217q\u0304\n\n\u2744\n\nD\u2217p\u0304\n\n\u2732\n\nE\u2217q\u0304\n\n\u2732\n\nE\u2217p\u0304 ,\n\n\u2744\n\nwhenever q\u0304 \u2264 p\u0304.\nWe let {Z[0]} \u2208 PChn denote the perverse chain complex that at each perversity consists\nof a single Z term in degree 0.\nBy [14], a symmetric monoidal product \u22a0 is obtained by setting ({D\u2217\u22c6 } \u22a0 {E\u2217\u22c6 })r\u0304 =\nlim D\u2217p\u0304 \u2297 E\u2217q\u0304 .\n\u2212\u2192\n\np\u0304+q\u0304\u2264r\u0304\n\nDefinition 5.2. A Leinster partial restricted commutative DGA is a functor A from \u03a6\nto the category PChn of n-perverse chain complexes (with images of objects denoted by\nA(k\u0304) := {A\u22c6k,\u2217 }), or simply {A\u22c6k } when we will not be working with individual degrees and\nno confusion will result, together with morphisms\n\u03b6k,l : {A\u22c6k+l } \u2192 {A\u22c6k } \u22a0 {A\u22c6l }\nfor each k, l and\n\u03b60 : {A\u22c60 } \u2192 {Z[0]},\nsuch that the following conditions hold:\n34\n\n\f1.

For any compact oriented PL stratified pseudomanifold Y , the\npartially-defined intersection pairing on the perverse chain complex {S \u2212n I \u22c6 C\u2217 (Y )} extends\nto the structure of a Leinster partial restricted commutative DGA.\nSo we must define an appropriate functor A such that {A\u22c61 } \u223c\n= {S \u2212n IC\u2217\u22c6 (Y )} and maps\n\u03b6k,l and show that the conditions of the definition are satisfied. Furthermore, the {A\u22c6n }\nshould be domains for appropriate intersection pairings, which which will be encoded within\nthe functoriality.\n35\n\n\fTo proceed, let us say that a collection of n-perversities P = {p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k } satisfies P \u2264 r\u0304\nP\nif ki=1 p\u0304i (j) \u2264 r\u0304(j) for all j \u2264 n. Then we define a functor G : \u03a6 \u2192 PChn by letting\nG0 = {Z[0]} and\n{G\u22c6k }(r\u0304) = lim GPk ,\n\u2212\u2192\nP \u2264r\n\nwith GPk as defined above in Section 3. This will be our functor \"A\". The fact that G is\nfunctorial on maps will be demonstrated below in the proof of the theorem.\nFor the definition of the \u03b6k,l , we will show in Proposition 5.4, deferred to below, that for\n1 \u2210P2\ntwo collections of perversities P1 = {p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k }, P2 = {p\u0304k+1 , . . . , p\u0304k+l }, the inclusion GPk+l\nP\nP\ninto the appropriate tensor product of terms S \u2212n I p\u0304i C\u2217 (X) has its image in Gk 1 \u2297 Gl 2 . Thus\nP1 \u2210P2\n\u2282 GPk 1 \u2297 GPl 2 .\nGk+l\n\n(9)\n\nFurthermore, as observed by Hovey [14], the symmetric monoidal product on perverse chain\ncomplexes is associative in the strong sense that\n{{D \u22c6 } \u22a0 {E \u22c6 } \u22a0 {F \u22c6 }}r\u0304 \u223c\n=\n\nlim\n\u2212\u2192\n\nD p\u03041 \u2297 E p\u03042 \u2297 F p\u03043 ,\n\np\u03041 +p\u03042 +p\u03043 \u2264r\u0304\n\nindependent of arrangement of parentheses, and similarly for products of more terms; the\nupshot of this is that any time we take a limit over tensor products of limits, it is equivalent\nto taking a single limit over tensor products all at once. Thus, applying lim to (9)\n\u2192\nP\u2212\ni\n\np\u0304i \u2264r\u0304\n{G\u22c6k+l }r\u0304\n\nand recalling that direct limits are exact functors, we obtain the inclusion of\nin\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\nr\u0304\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\n{{Gk } \u22a0 {Gl }} . Together, these give an inclusion \u03b6k,l : {Gk+l } \u0592\u2192 {{Gk } \u22a0 {Gl }}.\nWe now prove that G, together with the maps \u03b6k,l , is a Leinster partial restricted commutative DGA.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Assuming condition (1) of the definition for the moment as well as\ncontinuing to assume Proposition 5.4, in order to check the other conditions of the definition,\nit is only necessary to check what happens for a specific set of perversities, since we can then\napply the direct limit functor, which is exact. For example, given collections of perversities\nP1 , P2 , P3 of length k, l, and n, condition (2) holds in the form\n\u2732\n\n1 \u2210P2 \u2210P3\nGPk+l+n\n\n1 \u2210P2\n\u2297 GPn3\nGPk+l\n\n(10)\n\u2744\n\nGPk 1\n\n\u2297\n\nP2 \u2210P3\nGl+n\n\n\u2744\n\u2732\n\nGPk 1\n\n\u2297\n\nGPl 2\n\n\u2297 GPn3 .\n\nThis is clear from Proposition 5.4 and the usual properties of tensor products. Now, to verify\ncondition (2), we need only verify commutativity of diagram (8) at each perversity r\u0304, but\nthe evaluation at r\u0304 is simply the direct limit of diagram (10) over all collections P1 , P2 , P3\nwith P1 \u2210 P2 \u2210 P3 \u2264 r\u0304, using again Hovey's associativity property of the monoidal product.\nConditions (3) and (4) follow similarly from standard properties of tensor products, while\ncondition (5) follows from Theorem 3.7 and the exactness of the direct limit functor.\n36\n\n\fNow, for condition (1), we must first demonstrate the functoriality of G, which means\ndescribing how G acts on maps R : k\u0304 \u2192  \u0304l. We abbreviate G(R) by R\u2217 . Once again, we can\n\u2032\nstart at the level of a specific GPk : Given R and GPk , we must define R\u2217 : GPk \u2192 GPl for some\ncollection P \u2032 of perversities such that if P \u2264 r\u0304 then P \u2032 \u2264 r\u0304. For each GPk with P \u2264 r\u0304, this\n\u2032\n\u2032\ngives us a legal composite map GPk \u2192 GPl \u2192 limP \u2032 \u2264r\u0304 GPl . Once we do this in a way that is\n\u2212\u2192\ncompatible with the inclusions GPk \u0592\u2192 GQ\nk when P \u2264 Q \u2264 r\u0304 (meaning each perversity in P\nis \u2264 the corresponding perversity in Q), then R\u2217 : {G\u22c6k } \u2192 {G\u22c6l } can be obtained by taking\nappropriate direct limits.\nSo consider a set map R : k\u0304 \u2192  \u0304l. In [20], McClure defines the morphism R\u2217 : Gk \u2192 Gl\non the groups associated to a manifold by proving that the composition (R!\u2217 )\u01edk has its image\n\u2217\n\u2217\nin \u01edl Gl so that defining R\u2217 by \u01ed\u22121\nl (R! )\u01edk makes sense. Here R! is the transfer map associated\nto the generalized diagonal R\u2217 ; see [20] or Sections 4 and 3, above. McClure's proof that we\nhave well-defined maps R\u2217 : Gk \u2192 Gl (from [20, Section 10]) continues to hold in our setting\nso far as general position goes, so that for pseudomanifolds and stratified general position,\n\u2217\n\u01ed\u22121\nl (R! )\u01edk is well-defined. However, we need next to take the perversities into account.\nAny such R : k\u0304 \u2192  \u0304l factors into a surjection, an injection, and permutations, so we\ncan treat each of these cases separately. For permutations, R = \u03c3 \u2208 Sk , we define R\u2217 on\nGPk \u2282 S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217 (X) \u2297* * *\u2297S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217 (X) by the (appropriately signed) permutation of terms\nas usual for tensor products. Since the defining stratified general position condition for GPk\nis symmetric in all terms, the image will lie in G\u03c3P\nk , where \u03c3P denotes the appropriately\npermuted collection of perversities. It is clear that if P \u2264 r\u0304 then so is \u03c3P and also that this\nis functorial with respect to the inclusion maps in the poset of collections of perversities,\nand so \u03c3 induces a well-defined homomorphism Gk \u2192 Gk .\nNext, suppose that R is an injection. Without loss of generality (since we have already\nconsidered permutations), we assume that R(i) = i for all i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. In this case,\nR\u2217 : X l \u2192 X k is the projection onto the first k factors. Given an element \u03be \u2208 GPk \u2282\nS \u2212n C\u2217 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X), it is easy to check that, up to possible signs, R\u2217 (\u03be) = \u03be \u2297\nS \u2212n \u0393 \u2297 * * * S \u2212n \u0393, with l \u2212 k copies of the shift of the fundamental orientation class \u0393. But\n\u0393 \u2208 I p\u0304 C\u2217 (X) for any perversity, in particular for p\u0304 = 0. So R\u2217 (\u03be) \u2208 S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297\nS \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217 (X) \u2297 S \u2212n I 0\u0304 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n I 0\u0304 C\u2217 (X). Furthermore, since we have noted that\nl\u2212k\nstratified general position continues to hold under R\u2217 , this must be an element of GlP \u2210 0\u0304 ,\nwhere P \u2210l\u2212k 0\u0304 = {p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k , 0\u0304, . . . , 0\u0304} adjoins l \u2212 k copies of the 0\u0304 perversity. Clearly\nP \u2210l\u2212k 0\u0304 \u2264 r\u0304 if and only if P \u2264 r\u0304, so indeed R\u2217 induces a map of G. This is also clearly\nfunctorial with respect to the poset maps P \u2264 Q.\nFinally, we have the case where R is a surjection. All surjections can be written as\ncompositions of permutations and surjections of the form R(1) = R(2) = 1, R(k) = k \u2212 1 for\nk > 2, so we will assume we have a surjection of this form. In this case, R\u2217 (x1 , x2 , . . . , xl ) =\n(x1 , x1 , x2 , . . . , xl ), and the intuition is that R\u2217 should correspond to the intersection product\nin the first two terms and the identity on the remaining terms. However, we must be careful\nto remember that the transfer R! does not necessarily give us a well-defined intersection\nmap on primitives of the tensor product, only for chains in the tensor product satisfying the\ngeneral position requirement, which may occur only due to certain cancellations amongst\n\n37\n\n\fsums of primitives. So we must be careful to make sense of our intuition. Nonetheless, by\nP\np\u03043 ,...,p\u0304(k)\nProposition 5.4, GPk \u2282 G2p\u03041 ,p\u03042 \u2297Gk\u22122\n, so that \u03be \u2208 GPk can be written as i,j \u03b7j \u2297\u03bci , where\n\u03b7j \u2208 Gp\u030421 ,p\u03042 . Writing R = R2 \u00d7 id, where R2 : 2\u0304 \u2192 1\u0304 is the unique function, it now makes\nP\nsense that R\u2217 = R2\u2217 \u00d7 id\u2217 when applied to \u03be, so that we obtain R\u2217 (\u03be) =\nR2\u2217 (\u03b7j ) \u2297 \u03bci .\n\u2212n s\u0304\nFurthermore, each R2\u2217 (\u03b7j ) will live in S I C\u2217 (X), where s\u0304 is the minimal perversity over\np\u03041 and p\u03042 (see Section 4.3). So, R\u2217 (\u03be) \u2208 S \u2212n I s\u0304 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 S \u2212n I p\u03043 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217 (X).\nP\nApplying Lemma 4.15, if P \u2264 r\u0304 then s\u0304 + i\u22653 p\u0304i \u2264 r\u0304. The image of R\u2217 is already known to\nsatisfy the requisite stratified general position requirements (see above), and so R\u2217 induces\n3 ,...,p\u0304k\na map from GPk to Gs\u0304,p\u0304\n, which induces a map on G.\nk\u22121\nWe conclude that G is a functor.\nThe naturality of the \u03b6k,l follows immediately: the only thing to check is compatible\nbehavior between \u03b6k,l and \u03b6k\u2032,l\u2032 given two functions R1 : k\u0304 \u2192 k\u0304 \u2032 and R2 :  \u0304l \u2192  \u0304l\u2032 . But\nthis is now easily checked since the \u03b6 are inclusions and since the definitions of the maps\nG(R) = R\u2217 are built precisely upon these inclusions and the ability to separate tensor\nproducts into different groupings, which is allowed by Proposition 5.4.\nFinally, we turn to the deferred proposition showing that the maps \u03b6 are induced by\nwell-defined inclusions.\nProposition 5.4. Let P = {p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k+l }, P1 = {p\u03041 , . . . , p\u0304k }, and P2 = {p\u0304k+1 , . . . , p\u0304k+l }.\nThen GPk+l \u2282 GPk 1 \u2297 GPl 2 .\nWe first need a lemma.\nP\nLet \u03be \u2208 GPk+l \u2282 S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217 (X) \u2297* * *\u2297S \u2212n I p\u0304k+l C\u2217 (X). We can write \u03be = \u03bei1 \u2297* * *\u2297\u03beik+l ,\nand we can fix a triangulation of X with respect to which all possible \u03beij are simplicial chains.\n(Note: we assume that \u03bei \u2208 S \u2212n I p\u0304i C\u2217 (X) rather than taking \u03bei \u2208 I p\u0304i C\u2217 (X) and then having\nto work with shifted chains S \u2212n \u03be for the rest of the argument; this leads to some abuse of\nnotation in what follows, but this is preferable to dragging hordes of the symbol S \u2212n around\nP\neven more than necessary). Next, using that each \u03beij is a sum \u03beij = bijk \u03c3k , where the \u03c3k are\nP\nsimplices of the triangulation, we rewrite \u03be as \u03be =\nai1 ...ik+l \u03bei1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03beik \u2297 \u03c3ik+1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c3ik+l .\nIn order to do this, we must of course consider \u03be as an element of S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297\nS \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217 (X) \u2297 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X). To help with the notation, we let I be a\nmulti-index of k components, and we let J be a multi-index of l components. Then we can\nP\nwrite \u03be = I,J aI,J \u03beI \u2297 \u03c3J , where aI,J \u2208 Z, \u03beI \u2208 S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217 (X) and each\n\u03c3J is a specific tensor product of simplices \u03c3ik+1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c3ik+l .\nP\nP\nNow, we fix a specific multi-index J such that I aI,J \u03beI \u2297 \u03c3J 6= 0. Let \u03b7J = I aI,J \u03beI\nP\n(so \u03be = J \u03b7J \u2297 \u03c3J ).\nLemma 5.5. \u03b7J \u2208 GPk 1 .\n\nProof. On the one hand, it is clear that each \u03b7J is a sum of tensor products of intersection\nchains, allowable with respect to the appropriate perversities. This is because in defining the\n\u03b7J , we only split apart \u03be in the last l slots, so that each \u03b7J is an appropriate sum of tensor\nproducts of chains \u03beij , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k.\n38\n\n\fOn the other hand, GPk+l \u2282 Gk+l , and, by [20, Lemma 11.1], Gk+l \u2282 Gk \u2297 Gl (that\nargument is for manifolds, but works just as well here). So, as an element of Gk+l , \u03be can be\nP\nrewritten as\n\u03bcI \u2297 \u03bdJ , where \u03bcI \u2208 Gk and \u03bdJ \u2208 Gl . But now rewriting again by splitting\nP\nall the \u03bdJ up into tensor products of simplices, we recover \u03be = J \u03b7J \u2297 \u03c3J , but we now see\nthat each \u03b7J can also be written as a sum of \u03bcI s, each of which is in Gk . Hence each \u03b7J is\nin both Gk and S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217 (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217 (X). Thus each is in GPk 1 .\n\nProof of Proposition 5.4. Consider the inclusions i1 : GPk 1 \u0592\u2192 \u2297ki=1 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X) and i2 : GPl 2 \u0592\u2192\n\u2297li=1 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X). Let q1 be the projection \u2297ki=1 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X) \u2192 cok(i1 ) and similarly for q2 .\nNote that cok(i1 ), cok(i2 ) are torsion free, since if any multiple of a chain \u03be is in stratified\ngeneral position, then \u03be itself must also be in stratified general position and similarly for the\nallowability conditions defining the intersection chain complexes. Now, by basic homological\nalgebra (see, e.g., [20, Lemma 11.3]), GPk 1 \u2297 GPl 2 is precisely the kernel of\n!\n!\nk\nl\nl\nl\nO\nO\nO\nO\nq1 \u2297id+id\u2297q2 :\nS \u2212n C\u2217 (X)\u2297\nS \u2212n C\u2217 (X) \u2192 cok(i1 ) \u2297\nS \u2212n C\u2217 (X) \u2295\nS \u2212n C\u2217 (X) \u2297 cok(i2 )\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n.\n\nSo, if \u03be \u2208 GPk+l , we need only show that \u03be is in the kernel of this homomorphism, and it\nsuffices to show that it is in the kernels of q1 \u2297 id and id \u2297 q2 separately. We will show the\nfirst; the argument for the second is the same.\nN\nN\nSo, we consider \u03be \u2208 GPk+l \u2282 ki=1 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X) \u2297 li=1 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X) and consider the image\nN\nP\nin cok(i1 ) \u2297 li=1 S \u2212n C\u2217 (X) under q1 \u2297 id. As above, we can rewrite \u03be here as\n\u03b7J \u2297 \u03c3J .\nBut now it follows from the preceding lemma that \u03b7J \u2208 GPk 1 and thus represents 0 in cok(i1 ).\nSo \u03be \u2208 ker(q1 \u2297 id).\nBy analogy, \u03be \u2208 ker(id \u2297 q2 ), and we are done.\n\n6\n\nThe intersection pairing in sheaf theoretic intersection homology\n\nIn [12], Goresky and MacPherson defined the intersection homology intersection pairing\ngeometrically for compact oriented PL pseudomanifolds. They used McCrory's theory of\nstratified general position [21] to show that any two PL intersection cycles are intersection homologous to cycles in stratified general position. The intersection of cycles is then\nwell-defined, and if C \u2208 I p\u0304 C\u2217 (X) and D \u2208 I q\u0304 C\u2217 (X) are in stratified general position, the\nintersection C \u22d4 D is in I r\u0304 C\u2217 (X) for any r\u0304 with r\u0304 \u2265 p\u0304 + q\u0304. By [13], however, intersection homology duality was being realized on topological pseudomanifolds as a consequence\nof Verdier duality of sheaves in the derived category D b (X), and the intersection pairing\nwas constructed via a sequences of extensions of morphisms from X \u2212 \u03a3 to all of X (see\nL\n\nalso [2]). The resulting morphism in MorDb (X) (I p\u0304 C\u2217 \u2297 I q\u0304 C\u2217 , I r\u0304 C \u2217 ) indeed yields a pairing\nI p\u0304 Hi (X) \u2297 I q\u0304 Hj (X) \u2192 I r\u0304 Hi+j\u2212n (X), but it is not completely obvious that this pairing\nshould agree with the earlier geometric one on PL pseudomanifolds. In this section, we\ndemonstrate that these pairings do, indeed, coincide. While this is no doubt \"known to the\n39\n\n\fexperts,\" I know of no prior written proof. Furthermore, using the domain G constructed\nabove, we provide a \"roof\" in the category of sheaf complexes on X that serves as a concrete\nrepresentative of the derived category intersection pairing morphism.\nWe first recall that, as noted in Remark 3.8, our general position theorems of Section 3\nhold just as well if we consider instead the complexes C\u2217\u221e (X) and I p\u0304 C\u2217\u221e (X). In fact, the definitions of stratified general position carry over immediately, and all homotopies constructed\nin the proof of Theorems 3.5 and 3.7 are proper so that they yield well-defined maps on these\nlocally-finite chain complexes. The proofs that Gk and GPk are quasi-isomorphic to the appropriate tensor products is the same. We can also consider \"mixed type\" Gk s that are quasiisomorphic to S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217\u221e (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n I p\u0304j C\u2217\u221e (X) \u2297 S \u2212n I p\u0304j+1 C\u2217c (X) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217c (X).\nFor an open U \u2282 X, let GPk (U) denote GPk with respect to the pseudomanifold U. Then\nP,\u221e\nGk is a contravariant functor from the category of open subsets of X and inclusions to the\ncategory of chain complexes and chain maps. This is immediate, since if C \u2208 S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217\u221e (X)\u2297\n* * * \u2297 S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217\u221e (X) is such that \u03b5\u0304k (C) is in general position with respect to the appropriate\ndiagonal maps, then certainly \u03b5\u0304k (C)|U (k) = \u03b5\u0304k (C|U ) maintains its general position, where\nC|U is the restriction of C to S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217\u221e (U) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n I p\u0304k C\u2217\u221e (U). It is also clear that such\nP,\u221e\nP\nrestriction is functorial. Let Gk,\u2217\nbe the sheafification of the presheaf GP,\u221e\nk,\u2217 : U \u2192 Gk,\u2217 (U).\nNote that the k here denotes the number of terms in the tensor product, while \u2217 is the\ndimension index.\nLet I P C\u2217 be the sheafification of the presheaf I P C\u2217 : U \u2192 S \u2212n I p\u03041 C\u2217\u221e (U) \u2297 * * * \u2297\n\u2212n p\u0304k \u221e\nS I C\u2217 (U). This is the tensor product of the sheaves I p\u0304i C\u2217 with I p\u0304i C\u2217 (U) = S \u2212n I p\u0304i C\u2217\u221e (U),\nwhich are the (degree shifted) intersection chain sheaves of [13] (see also [2, Chapter II]).\nN.B. We build the shifts into the definitions of all sheaves and of the presheaf IC\u2217P\n(which, after all, is not unusual in intersection cohomology with certain indexing schemes see [13]). However, for chain complexes of a single perversity, I p\u0304 C\u2217 (X) continues to denote\nthe unshifted complex, and we write in any shifts as necessary.\nP \u221e\nLemma 6.1. The inclusion of presheaves GP,\u221e\nk,\u2217 \u0592\u2192 I C\u2217 induces a quasi-isomorphism of\nP\nsheaves Gk,\u2217\n\u2192 I P C\u2217 .\nP \u221e\nProof. By the results of Section 3, each inclusion GP,\u221e\nk,\u2217 (U) \u0592\u2192 I C\u2217 (U) is a quasi-isomorphism.\nTaking direct limits over neighborhoods of each point x \u2208 X therefore yields isomorphisms\nof stalk cohomologies.\n\nCorollary 6.2. For any system of supports \u03a6, the sheaf map of the lemma induces a hyperP\n\u03a6\nP\nhomology isomorphism for each U, H\u03a6\n\u2217 (U; Gk,\u2217 ) \u2192 H\u2217 (U; I C\u2217 ).\nP\nProposition 6.3. If i p\u0304i \u2264 r\u0304, then the intersection product \u03bck induces a sheaf map m :\nP\nGk,\u2217\n\u2192 I r\u0304 C\u2217 .\nProof. We need only note that the intersection product \u03bck : GP,\u221e\n(U) \u2192 S \u2212n I r\u0304 C\u2217\u221e (U)\nk\nbehaves functorially under restriction. Thus, it induces a map of presheaves, which induces\nthe map of sheaves.\nLemma 6.4. On X \u2212 \u03a3, the sheaf map m of the preceding proposition is quasi-isomorphic\nto the standard product map \u03c6 : Z|X\u2212\u03a3 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Z|X\u2212\u03a3 \u2192 Z|X\u2212\u03a3 .\n40\n\n\fP\nProof. We first observe that Gk,\u2217\n|X\u2212\u03a3 \u223cq.i. Z|X\u2212\u03a3 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Z|X\u2212\u03a3 :\nP\nGk,\u2217\n|X\u2212\u03a3 \u223cq.i. I P C\u2217 |X\u2212\u03a3\n\n= I p\u03041 C\u2217 |X\u2212\u03a3 \u2297 * * * \u2297 I p\u0304k C\u2217 |X\u2212\u03a3\n\u223cq.i. Z|X\u2212\u03a3 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Z|X\u2212\u03a3 .\nNow, for each point x \u2208 X\u2212\u03a3, let U \u223c\n= Rn be a euclidean neighborhood. Then a generator\nof ZU \u2297* * *\u2297ZU corresponds to S \u2212n O \u2297* * *\u2297S \u2212n O, where O is the n-dimensional orientation\ncycle for Rn in Cn\u221e (U). But \u03b5\u0304k (S \u2212n O \u2297 * * * S \u2212n O) is automatically in stratified general\nposition with respect to the diagonal \u2206 by dimension considerations; thus S \u2212n O\u2297* * *\u2297S \u2212n O\n\u2212n\nis in GP,\u221e\nO \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212n O under \u03bck is again S \u2212n O \u2208\nk,0 . Furthermore the image of S\nS \u2212n Cn\u221e (U), which corresponds to a generator of ZU \u223cq.i. S \u2212n I r\u0304 C\u2217 |U. This can be seen by\nconsidering O \u22d4 * * * \u22d4 O, which is classically equal to O, and by using the results of the\npreceding Section.\nSince all of the above is compatible with restrictions and induces isomorphisms on the\nrestrictions from Rn to B n (for any open ball B n in Rn ), and since it is this map of presheaves\nthat induces the map of sheaves we are considering, the lemma follows.\nLemma 6.5. IC\u2217 is a flat sheaf.\nProof. For each i and each open U \u2282 X, ICi\u221e (U) is torsion free. Thus tensor product of\nabelian groups with ICi\u221e (U) is an exact functor, and thus IC\u2217 is flat as a presheaf. Taking\ndirect limits shows that tensor product with IC\u2217 is exact as a functor of sheaves. So IC\u2217 is\nflat.\nWe now limit ourselves to considering GP2 with various supports.\nLet P\u2217p\u0304 be the perversity p\u0304 Deligne sheaf (see [13, 2]), reindexed to be compatible with\nour current homological notation. According to [2, Proposition V.9.14], there is in D b (X)\nL\n\na unique morphism \u03a6 : P\u2217p\u0304 \u2297 P\u2217q\u0304 \u2192 P\u2217r\u0304 that extends the multiplication morphism \u03c6 :\nZX\u2212\u03a3 \u2297 ZX\u2212\u03a3 \u2192 ZX\u2212\u03a3 . Since I p\u0304 C\u2217 is quasi-isomorphic to P\u2217p\u0304 by [13] and flat by Lemma\nL\n\n6.5, the tensor complex I p\u0304 C\u2217 \u2297 I q\u0304 C\u2217 represents P\u2217p\u0304 \u2297 P\u2217q\u0304 in D b (X), and we can represent\nL\n\nmorphisms P\u2217p\u0304 \u2297 P\u2217q\u0304 \u2192 P\u2217r\u0304 in D b (X) by roofs in the category of sheaf complexes\ns\n\nf\n\nI p\u0304 C\u2217 \u2297 I q\u0304 C\u2217 \u2190 S\u2217 \u2192 I r\u0304 C\u2217 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere f is a sheaf morphism and s is a sheaf quasi-isomorphism. For the duality product\nP\nmorphism, we set S\u2217 equal to G2,\u2217\n, and let f be the sheaf map m of Proposition 6.3 and s\nthe quasi-isomorphism of Lemma 6.1. We will show that the restriction of this roof to X \u2212 \u03a3\nis equivalent to \u03c6 : ZX\u2212\u03a3 \u2297 ZX\u2212\u03a3 \u2192 ZX\u2212\u03a3 in D b (X \u2212 \u03a3).\nProposition 6.6.

From [2, Section V.9], the sheaf theoretic pairing is induced by the unique extension of the morphism \u03c6 : ZX\u2212\u03a3 \u2297 ZX\u2212\u03a3 \u2192 ZX\u2212\u03a3 in MorDb (X\u2212\u03a3) (ZX\u2212\u03a3 \u2297 ZX\u2212\u03a3 , ZX\u2212\u03a3 ) to\nL\n\nMorDb (X) (I p\u0304 C\u2217 \u2297I q\u0304 C\u2217 , I r\u0304 C\u2217 ). Given this unique extension, which we shall denote \u03c0, the intersection homology pairings can be described as follows. Since the intersection chain sheaves\nare soft (see [2, Chapter II]), a generating element s \u2297 t \u2208 IHi\u03a6 (X) \u2297 IHj\u03a8 (X) (where \u03a6 and\n\u03a8 represent c or \u221e) is represented by sections s \u2208 \u0393\u03a6 (X; I p\u0304 Ci\u2212n ) and t \u2208 \u0393\u03a8 (X; I q\u0304 Cj\u2212n )\nsuch that \u2202s = \u2202t = 0 as sections. Since (I p\u0304 Ci\u2212n \u2297 I q\u0304 Cj\u2212n )x \u223c\n= (I p\u0304 Ci\u2212n )x \u2297 (I p\u0304 Cj\u2212n )x , s \u2297 t\nL\n\ndetermines a section of \u0393(X; I p\u0304 Ci\u2212n \u2297 I q\u0304 Cj\u2212n ), which is isomorphic to \u0393(X; I p\u0304 Ci\u2212n \u2297 I q\u0304 Cj\u2212n )\nby Lemma 6.5. If either s or t has compact support, so does s \u2297 t. This section then maps\nL\n\nto a cycle in any injective resolution of I p\u0304 C\u2217 \u2297 I q\u0304 C\u2217 and thus represents an element z in the\nL\n\nhyperhomology Hi+j\u22122n (X; I p\u0304 C\u2217 \u2297 I q\u0304 C\u2217 ). If s \u2297 t has compact support, z also represents an\nL\n\nelement of Hci+j\u22122n (X; I p\u0304 C\u2217 \u2297 I q\u0304 C\u2217 ).\nNow, due to Corollary 6.7, the morphism \u03c0 is represented by the roof\nq.i.\n\nm\n\nP\nI p\u0304 C\u2217 \u2297 I q\u0304 C\u2217 \u2190 G2,\u2217\n\u2192 I r\u0304 C\u2217 ,\n\nwhich induces hyperhomology morphisms\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u03a6\nP\n\u03a6\nr\u0304\np\u0304\nq\u0304\nH\u03a6\n\u2217 (X; I C\u2217 \u2297 I C\u2217 ) \u2190 H\u2217 (X; G2,\u2217 ) \u2192 H\u2217 (X; I C\u2217 ).\n\nMaking the desired choices of supports and applying to z the composition of the inverse\nof the lefthand isomorphism and the righthand morphism gives the pairings as defined via\nsheaf theory.\nNow, consider the following diagram. For the moment, we take \u03a6 = \u03a8, which can be\neither c or \u221e.\n\u223c\n=\nH\u2217 (S \u2212n I p\u0304 C\u2217\u03a6 (X) \u2297 S \u2212n I q\u0304 C\u2217\u03a8 (X)) \u271b\n\nH\u2217 (GP,\u03a6\n2,\u2217 )\n\n\u2732\n\nH\u2217 (S \u2212n I r\u0304 C\u2217\u03a6 (X))\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u2744\np\u0304\nH\u03a6\n\u2217 (X; I C\u2217\n\nq\u0304\n\n\u2297 I C\u2217 )\n\n\u271b\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u2744\nP\nH\u03a6\n\u2217 (X; G2,\u2217 )\n\n\u2732\n\n(14)\n\u2744\n\nr\u0304\nH\u03a6\n\u2217 (X; I C\u2217 ).\n\nThe groups on the top row are simply the homology groups of the sections of presheaves\nwith supports in \u03a6. The vertical homology maps are induced by taking presheaf sections to\nsheaf sections to sections of injective resolutions. Since sheafification and injective resolution\nare natural functors, the diagram commutes. Applied to the tensor product of two chains\nin stratified general position, the composition of the lefthand vertical map with the maps of\nthe bottom row is exactly the sheaf theoretic pairing as described above. Meanwhile, the\ncomposition of maps along the top row is the geometric pairing \u03bc2 defined above using the\ndomain GP,\u221e\n. The theorem now follows in this case from the commutativity of the diagram\n2\nand the results of the previous sections, in which we demonstrated that, for a pair of chains\nin stratified general position, \u03bc2 agrees with the Goresky-MacPherson product.\n43\n\n\fWhen \u03a6 = c and \u03a8 = \u221e, we must be a bit more careful. Here we replace H\u2217 (GP,\u03a6\n2,\u2217 )\nP,\u221e\nwith the homology of the subcomplex \u011cP2,\u2217 (X) \u2282 G2,\u2217 (X) defined as follows. Recall that\n\u2212n p\u0304 \u221e\nGP,\u221e\nI C\u2217 (X) \u2297 S \u2212n I q\u0304 C\u2217\u221e (X). Thus any element e \u2208 GP2,\u2217 (X)\n2,\u2217 (X) is a subcomplex of S\nP\ncan be written as a finite sum e = S \u2212n \u03bei \u2297S \u2212n \u03b7i , where \u03bei \u2208 I p\u0304 C\u2217\u221e (X) and \u03b7i \u2208 I q\u0304 C\u2217\u221e (X).\nWe let \u011cP2,\u2217 (X) consist of such sums for which each \u03bei has compact support. This is clearly\na subcomplex, and the general position proof of Section 3 shows that \u011cP2,\u2217 (X) is quasiisomorphic to S \u2212n I p\u0304 C\u2217c (X) \u2297 S \u2212n I q\u0304 C\u2217\u221e (X). We also observe that the image of each such\nP\nelement of \u011cP2,\u2217 (X) in the sheaf G2,\u2217\n(X) has compact support. Indeed, if x \u2208\n/ \u222a|\u03bei |, which is\nP \u2212n\ncompact, then the restriction of e to a neighborhood U of x must have the form\nS 0\u2297\n\u2212n\nS \u03b7i |U = 0.\nP\nNow we can take diagram (14) with \u03a6 = c, \u03a8 = \u221e and with GP,\u221e\n2,\u2217 (X) replaced by \u011c2,\u2217 (X)\nin the middle of the top row. The diagram continues to commute, and the correspondence\nbetween the geometric and sheaf-theoretic pairings follows as for the preceding cases.\nAs a result of the theorem, several common practices become easily justified. For\nexample, we can demonstrate that the sheaf theoretic product has a symmetric middledimensional pairing for oriented Witt spaces of dimension 0 mod 4 and an anti-symmetric\nmiddle-dimensional pairing for oriented Witt spaces of dimension 2 mod 4. To see this, we\nnote that, if C \u2208 I p\u0304 Ci (X) and D \u2208 I q\u0304 Cj (X) with p\u0304 + q\u0304 \u2264 r\u0304 for some r\u0304 and C and D in\nstratified general position, then\nS n \u03bc2 (S \u2212n C, S \u2212n D) = C \u22d4 D\n= (\u22121)(n\u2212i)(n\u2212j) D \u22d4 C\n= (\u22121)(n\u2212i)(n\u2212j) S n \u03bc2 (S \u2212n D, S \u2212n C).\nThe second equality here uses the well-known graded symmetry of geometric intersection\nproducts. So, in particular, if X is a Witt space and p\u0304 = q\u0304 = m\u0304, the lower middle perversity,\nand if n = 4w and i = j = 2w, then the product is symmetric. Similarly, if n = 2w \u2261 2\nmod 4 and i = j = w, then the pairing is anti-symmetric.\nOf course this is well-known for geometric intersection products, but it is not completely\nobvious from Verdier duality (see, e.g., [1, Appendix]).\n\n7\n\nAppendix A - Sign issues\n\nIn this appendix we collect some technical lemmas, especially those that correct the sign\nissues in the original version of [20]. We refer the reader to the main text above for some\nof the definitions and also to the revised version of [20].

Therefore \u0398 is a\nchain map.

In other words, letting PXi be the Poincar\u00e9 duality map on the oriented\nmi -pseudomanifold Xi , given by the appropriately signed cap product with the fundamental\nclass \u0393Xi and shifted to be a degree 0 chain map, there is a commutative diagram\n\u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u2732 \u2212\u2217\nC (X1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Xk )\n\nC \u2212\u2217 (X1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 C \u2212\u2217 (Xk )\nP X1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 P Xk\n\nPX1 \u00d7***\u00d7Xk\n\u2744\n\n\u2744\n\nS \u2212m1 C\u2217 (X1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212mk C\u2217 (Xk )\n\n\u03b5\u0304k \u2732 \u2212 P mi\nS\nC\u2217 (X1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Xk ).\n\nProof. Let xi \u2208 C \u2212\u2217 (Xi ) P\nbe homogeneous elements of degree |xi |. Then (PX1 \u2297 * * * \u2297\nPXk )(x1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 xk ) = (\u22121) |xi|mi S \u2212m1 (x1 \u2229 \u0393X1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212mk (xk \u2229 \u0393Xk ) \u2208 S \u2212m1 X\u2217 (M1 ) \u2297\n* * * \u2297 S \u2212mk C\u2217 (Xk ). Notice that if |xi | is the degree of Xi in C \u2212\u2217 (Xi ) (making it a degree \u2212|xi | cochain), then each xi \u2229 \u0393Xi is an mi + |xi | chain,Pso that S \u2212mi (xi \u2229 \u0393Xi ) lives in\n(S \u2212mi C\u2217 (Xi ))|xi| as desired. Applying \u03b5\u0304, this gets taken to S \u2212 mi ((x1 \u2229\u0393X1 )\u00d7* * *\u00d7(xk \u2229\u0393Xk ))\ntimes \u22121 to the power\nX\ni\n\n|xi |mi +\n\nX\ni\u22652\n\n(mi\n\nX\n\n(|xj | + mj )) + e2 (m1 , . . . , mk ).\n\nj<i\n\n45\n\n\fThe first term of this power is carried over from the Poincar\u00e9 duality maps, the second comes\nfrom \u0398, and the last is the 2nd symmetric polynomial on m1 , . . . , mk from the definition of\nP\n\u03b5\u0304. Note that we can consider the second sum to be over all i by defining the null sum j<1\nto be 0.\nP\nP\nPulling out the \u0393s gives S \u2212 mi (x1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 xk ) \u2229 (\u0393X1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393Xk ) = S \u2212 mi (x1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7\nxk ) \u2229 \u0393X1 \u00d7***\u00d7Xk at the cost of an additional factor of \u22121 to the\nX\nX\nml (\n|xa |),\nl<k\n\na>l\n\nby [7, VII.12.17].

Looking at the\nP\nP\nterms that involve only m's, we have i mi j<i mj + e2 \u2261 0 mod 2, since these terms are\nP\nP\nidentical. Thus the sign is ( i mi )( j |xj |).\nOn the other hand, the top map of thePdiagram simply takes x1 \u2297 * * *\u2297 xk to x1 \u00d7 * * *\u00d7 xk ,\nwhile the righthand map takes this to S \u2212 mi (x1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 xk ) \u2229 \u0393X1 \u00d7***\u00d7Xk with a sign of (\u22121)\nto the\nX\nX\n(\n|xi |)(\nmj ).\ni\n\nj\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nThe next lemma demonstrates that our umkehr map \u2206!

The same proof works for a PL map between manifolds\nf : X n \u2192 Y m and the ensuing transfer f! defined on the complex C\u2217f (Y ) of chains in general\nposition with respect to f ; see [20]. We state and prove the lemma for both cases at once.\nFor the case of \u2206, we take Y = X(k).\nLemma 7.3. Suppose f : X m \u2192 Y n is either a PL map of manifolds or f = \u2206 : X \u2192 X(k).\nSuppose C \u2208 Cif (Y ), as defined for manifolds in [20] or for f = \u2206 as defined in Definition\n4.2.

We do not need this lemma directly in this paper, though the special case where\nall maps are generalized diagonals seems to be implicit in the proofs of Section 4.3. Here\nwe leave the lemma stated for manifolds rather than define the appropriate general position\nand stratified map notions for pseudomanifolds.\nLemma 7.4. Given PL maps of manifolds fi : Xini \u2192 Yimi , the following diagram commutes:\nS \u2212m1 C\u2217f1 (Y1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212mk C\u2217fk (Yk )\n\n\u03b5\u0304k\u2732\n\nS\u2212\n\nP\n\nmi\n\nf1! \u2297 * * * \u2297 fk!\n\nC\u2217f1 \u00d7***\u00d7fk (Yk \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Yk )\n(f1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 fk )!\n\n\u2744\n\nS \u2212n1 C\u2217 (X1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212nk C\u2217 (Xk )\n\n\u03b5\u0304\u2732\nk\n47\n\n\u2744\n\nS\u2212\n\nP\n\nni\n\nC\u2217f1 \u00d7***\u00d7fk (X1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Xk ).\n\n\fProof. Let S \u2212m1 x1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212mk xk be a generator of S \u2212m1 C\u2217f1 (Y1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212mk C\u2217fk (Yk ). The\nlefthand vertical map takes this to S \u2212n1 \u03c71 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212nk \u03c7k , where \u03c7i is the chain represented\nby the Poincar\u00e9 dual in Xi of the pullback by fi\u2217 of the Poincar\u00e9 dual in Yi of xi (see the\ndefinition of \u2206! in Section 4.2 and of f! in [20]). Here we take the Poincar\u00e9 duals with\nthe appropriate signs as discussed in that section. If xi has degree |xi |, then \u03c7i has degree\nni \u2212 mi + |xi |.\nP\nBy definition of \u03b5\u0304, the bottom map takes S \u2212n1 \u03c71 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212nk \u03c7k to S \u2212 ni (\u03c71 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u03c7k )\ntimes \u22121 to the\nX X\ne2 (n1 , . . . , nk ) +\nni ( (nj \u2212 mj + |xj |)).\ni\n\nj<i\n\nHere \u03c71 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u03c7k is the cross product of chains.\nP\nOn the other hand, \u03b5\u0304(S \u2212m1 x1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S \u2212mk xk ) equals S \u2212 mi x1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 xk times \u22121 to\nthe\nX\nX\n|xj |).\ne2 (m1 , . . . , mk ) +\nmi (\ni\n\nj<i\n\nThe righthand map then applies the transfer (f1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 fk )! to this.\nTo resolve these signs, we must compare how the Poincar\u00e9 duality maps on products\ncompare to the Poincar\u00e9 duals in the individual spaces. In particular, looking only at the\nsigns that arise within the transfer (and ignoring for the moment those that have already\ncome into the formulas above from the definition of \u03b5\u0304 and from the shift isomorphisms), we\nhave that each \u03c7i = (\u22121)mi (mi \u2212|xi |)+ni (mi \u2212|xi |) (fi\u2217 (xi \u03a5Yi )) \u2229 \u0393Xi . Here we recall that \u03a5 simply\nrefers to the inverse of the cap product (recall that our chains are actually represented by\nhomology classes; see Section 4.2), the first summand in the power of \u22121 comes from the\nPoincar\u00e9 duality map associated with \u03a5, and the second summand in the power of \u22121 comes\nfrom the Poincar\u00e9 duality map associated with \u2229\u0393Xi .\nThus\n\u03c71 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u03c7k = (\u22121)\n= (\u22121)\n\nP\n\ni (mi (mi \u2212|xi |)+ni (mi \u2212|xi |))\n\nP\n\ni (mi (mi \u2212|xi |)+ni (mi \u2212|xi |))+\n\n((f1\u2217 (x1 \u03a5Y1 )) \u2229 \u0393X1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 ((f1\u2217 (xk \u03a5Yk )) \u2229 \u0393Xk )\nP\n\u2217\ni ni ( j>i (mj \u2212|xj |) (f \u2217 (x \u03a5\n1 Y1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 fk (xk \u03a5Yk )) \u2229 (\u0393X1 \u00d7 * * *\n1\n\nP\n\n\u00d7 \u0393 Xk )\n\nfrom pulling out the cap products; see [7]\n= (\u22121)\n\nP\n\ni (mi (mi \u2212|xi |)+ni (mi \u2212|xi |))+\n\nP\n\nP\nni ( j>i (mj \u2212|xj |)\n\n= (\u22121)\n\nP\n\ni (mi (mi \u2212|xi |)+ni (mi \u2212|xi |))+\n\nP\n\nP\nP\nP\nni ( j>i (mj \u2212|xj |)+ i mi ( j>i (mj \u2212|xj |)\n\ni\n\ni\n\n(f1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 fk )\u2217 (x1 \u03a5Y1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 xk \u03a5Yk ) \u2229 \u0393X1 \u00d7***\u00d7Xk\n\n(f1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 fk )\u2217 ((x1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 xk )\u03a5Y1 \u00d7***Yk ) \u2229 \u0393X1 \u00d7***\u00d7Xk\nFinally, the power of \u22121 arising from the two Poincar\u00e9 duality maps in the definition of\n(f1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 fk )! is\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n(\nmi )(\nmj \u2212\n|xj |) + (\nni )(\nmj \u2212\n|xj |).\ni\n\nj\n\nj\n\ni\n\n48\n\nj\n\nj\n\n\fAltogether, we now have four sets of signs that we need to have cancel out:\nX X\ne2 (n1 , . . . , nk ) +\nni ( (nj \u2212 mj + |xj |))\ni\n\nj<i\n\ne2 (m1 , . . . , mk ) +\n\nX\n\nmi (\n\ni\n\nX\n\n|xj |)\n\nj<i\n\nX\nX X\nX\nX\n(mi (mi \u2212 |xi |) + ni (mi \u2212 |xi |)) +\nni ( (mj \u2212 |xj |) +\nmi ( (mj \u2212 |xj |)\ni\n\ni\n\n(\n\nX\ni\n\nmi )(\n\nX\nj\n\nmj \u2212\n\nX\n\nj>i\n\n|xj |) + (\n\nj\n\nX\ni\n\ni\n\nni )(\n\nX\n\nmj \u2212\n\nj\n\nX\n\nj>i\n\n|xj |)\n\nj\n\nTo see that these powers of \u22121 indeed do cancel each other (for which we only need to\nwork mod 2), first observe that for each fixed ni if we only look at terms involving ni and\nP\nthe various xj , the first expression gives us ni j<i |xj |, the second gives no such term, the\nP\nP\nthird gives ni (|xi | + j>i |xk |), and the last provides ni j |xj |, so these all cancel. Similarly,\nlooking at terms involving only mi and some |xj |, the first expression provides none of these,\nP\nP\nthe second provides mi j<i |xj |, the third provides mi (|xi |+ j>i |xj |), and the last provides\nP\nmi j |xj |, so these all cancel. For terms involving just the various ni , the first equation\nP P\nhas e2 (n1 , * * * , nk ) and i j<i ni nj , which cancel. For terms involving just mi s, the second\nP\nP\nexpression gives e2 (m1 , . . . , mk ), the third has i mi (mi + j>i mj ), and the last expression\nP P\nP P\nhas i j mi mj . To see that these all cancel out, notice that e2 (m1 , . . . , mk ) = i j>i mj ,\nP P\nthat all of the cross terms in i j mi mj are repeated and are thus 0 mod 2, and that\nP P\nP\nthe remaining terms in i j mi mj are precisely i mi mi . Finally, we examine terms of\nP\nthe form mi nj . For each fixed ni , the first expression contributes ni j<i mj , the third\nP\nP\ncontributes ni mi and ni j>i mj , and the last contributes ni j mj , which all cancel.\n\nSeveral diagrams in this paper were typeset using the TEX commutative diagrams package\nby Paul Taylor.\n\nReferences\n[1] Markus Banagl, Extending intersection homology type invariants to non-Witt spaces,\nvol. 160, Memoirs of the Amer.
