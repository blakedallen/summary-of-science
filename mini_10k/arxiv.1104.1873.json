However, the idea of value only after measurement becomes problematic when one\nconsiders quantum gravity, because measurements presuppose spacetime which emerges after the quantum era of the\nUniverse apart from the fact that there are no observers who can make projective measurements of the Universe [1].\nIndependently Ozawa [3] has pursued the possibility of assigning a context dependent value for a physical quantity\nbefore measurement, where the context describes outcomes of the measurements to be performed.\nOn the other hand, Born's rule [4] is an axiom of conventional quantum mechanics, though there is literature which\nclaims that the rule can be derived. It seems that there is a lack of either physical intuition because of a lack of a\nmeasurement process or a lack of mathematical rigor. We shall give a brief review of these notions restricting our\nattention to the orthodox view in the discussion part of the present work but not to the many world interpretation of\nquantum mechanics [5, 6].\nIn the present paper we show that the contextual value of an observable coincides with the weak value proposed\nby Aharonov and his colleagues [7, 8] on the basis of consistency of quantum mechanics with Kolmogorov's measure\ntheory of probability [9] and that this consistency also leads to Born's rule as the unique probability measure of\nevents to be discovered by the post-selection.\nThe organization of the present paper is as follows. After a brief preliminary in Sect 2, we present in Sect 3 a\ntheorem that the weak values are the contextual values of observables and give a derivation of Born's rule. The final\nsection is a summary and discussion of our results and includes a brief review of the claims of the derivation of Born's\nrule.\nII.\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nWe first set up the general framework. Let N be a set of observables which act on the Hilbert space H of finite\ndimension, i.e., dimH = N . Let V(N )max be the set of all maximal abelian subalgebras of N and choose a maximal\nabelian subalgebra Vmax \u2208 V(N )max , noting that the choice is not unique. Then we can select a complete orthonormal\nsystem {|\u03c9i}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 as the set of all simultaneous eigenstates of the elements of Vmax , where \u03a9 := {\u03c91 , * * * , \u03c9N }.\nHereafter,we identify the eigenspace of |\u03c9ih\u03c9| with \u03c9. Therefore, \u03a9 represents the way of orthogonal decomposition of\nthe Hilbert space H. We call the set {|\u03c9i}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 'context' induced by Vmax which is chosen from V(N )max . In due course\nwe will use Aharonov's formalism to interpret the complete orthonormal system {|\u03c9i}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 as the set of the states to be\n'post-selected'. Thus, since we fix the prepared, i.e., pre-selected state to be |\u03c8i throughout this paper, the 'context'\nis the context of the measurement to be performed. In the case of a finite dimensional Hilbert space, a different choice\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: ahosoya@th.phys.titech.ac.jp\naddress: koga@th.phys.titech.ac.jp\n\n\f2\nof Vmax \u2208 V(N )max amounts to a unitary transformation of the complete orthonormal system {|\u03c9i}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 . For infinite\ndimensional case, we have many types of von Neumann algebras [10, 11].\nWe introduce the probability space (\u03a9\u0303, F\u0303, P\u0303 ) adopting the standard notation of Kolmogorov's measure theory of\nprobability [9] as follows. The sample space is \u03a9\u0303 := {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9 | h\u03c9|\u03c8i 6= 0}, and the \u03c3-field F\u0303 over \u03a9\u0303 is the power set\nof \u03a9\u0303. P\u0303 is a probability measure over F\u0303 . The measure P\u0303 satisfies the relation: P\u0303 ({\u03c91 } \u222a {\u03c92 }) = P\u0303 ({\u03c91 , \u03c92 }) =\nP\u0303 ({\u03c91 }) + P\u0303 ({\u03c92 }). This means the probability of the event that \u03c91 is measured or \u03c92 is measured is the sum of\nP\u0303 ({\u03c91 }) and P\u0303 ({\u03c92 }). This probability space excludes the case {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9|h\u03c9|\u03c8i = 0}. We shall deal with the above case\nat the end of Sect 3. For notational simplicity, hereafter we represent the set {\u03c9} \u2208 F as \u03c9 so that P\u0303 (\u03c9) := P\u0303 ({\u03c9}).\nFor a fixed choice of Vmax , the field F is also fixed provided that we specify the prepared state |\u03c8i.\nIn what follows, we use the standard notation that R and C are the fields of real and complex numbers, respectively,\nand \u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z are the Pauli matrices.\nIII.\n\nTHE MAIN THEOREM\n\nWe denote the contextual value of A \u2208 N in \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9\u0303 by \u03bb\u03c9 (A) and define it as the nonzero map \u03bb\u03c9 : N \u2192 C which\nsatisfies the following conditions.\n(i) Sum Rule:\n\u03bb\u03c9 (A + B) = \u03bb\u03c9 (A) + \u03bb\u03c9 (B), \u2200A, B \u2208 N\n(ii) Product Rule:\n\u03bb\u03c9 (T S) = \u03bb\u03c9 (T )\u03bb\u03c9 (S), \u2200T, S \u2208 Vmax\n(iii) Initial condition:\n\u03bb\u03c9 (|\u03c8ih\u03c8|) = 1,\n\n\u03bb\u03c9 (|\u03c8 \u22a5 ih\u03c8 \u22a5 |) = 0,\n\nwhere |\u03c8i is the prepared (pre-selected) state and |\u03c8 \u22a5 i is an arbitrary state orthogonal to |\u03c8i.\n(iv) Invariance: The expectation value and the variance of an observable A defined by\nX\nP\u0303 (\u03c9)\u03bb\u03c9 (A),\nEx(A) :=\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303\n\nV ar(A) :=\n\nX\n\n\u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303\n\nP\u0303 (\u03c9)|\u03bb\u03c9 (A) \u2212 Ex(A)|2\n\n(2)\n\nare independent of the choice of Vmax and depends only on the prepared state |\u03c8i and A.\nSome remarks on these conditions are in order. The sum rule (i) excludes the possibility that the values \u03bb\u03c9 (A)\nand \u03bb\u03c9 (B) are eigenvalues of the observables A and B, if they do not\u221acommute. A simple example of this is \u03c3x and\n\u03c3y with the eigenvalues \u00b11, while the sum \u03c3x + \u03c3y has eigenvalues \u00b1 2. Historically, the rule (i) was introduced by\nvon Neumann [10] when he made an argument to refute the hidden variable theory. The product rule (ii) means that\nthe map \u03bb\u03c9 is a character on Vmax and implies that it can be seen as a 'valuation' on Vmax [2]. This means that the\ncontextual value for an observable T \u2208 Vmax can be identified with a classical value of T . We are going to generalize it\nto a contextual value of an observable A 6\u2208 Vmax , which has no counterparts in classical theory. We see that \u03bb\u03c9 (1) = 1\nfrom (ii). The requirement (iii) is just an assumption based on an intuition that the value of the projection operator\nof the initial state |\u03c8i is unity and the values of the projection operators of the states |\u03c8 \u22a5 i which are orthogonal to\nthe prepared |\u03c8i are zero if we know definitely what the initial states is. The invariance of the expectation value and\nthe variance of an obsevable A in the requirement (iv) uniquely determines the normal distribution function of the\nobservable obtained after repeating many experiments according to the central limit theorem.\nFrom the sum rule (i) we can apply Riez's theorem and using the normalization \u03bb\u03c9 (1) = 1, we can write the\ncontextual value of A \u2208 N as\n\u03bb\u03c9 (A) =\n\nTr[W\u03c9 A]\n,\nTr[W\u03c9 ]\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\nwith W\u03c9 being some operator. The product rule (ii) for the maximal abelian subalgebra Vmax narrows down the\nexpression for the operator W\u03c9 to\nW\u03c9 = a|\u03b1ih\u03c9| + b|\u03c9ih\u03b2| + W\u03c9\u22a5 , a, b \u2208 C,\n\n(4)\n\nfor some |\u03b1i \u2208 H and h\u03b2| \u2208 H\u2217 , where H\u2217 is the dual space of H. Here W\u03c9\u22a5 is an operator which satisfies\n{W\u03c9\u22a5 , |\u03c9ih\u03c9|} = 0. The requirement (iii) implies that W\u03c9 has a form W\u03c9 = |\u03c8ihq| + |rih\u03c8| for some hq| and |ri.\nEquating this with (4), we find that |\u03b1i = |\u03c8i, h\u03b2| = h\u03c8| and W\u03c9\u22a5 = 0 so that\nW\u03c9 = a|\u03c8ih\u03c9| + b|\u03c9ih\u03c8|, a, b \u2208 C,\n\n(5)\n\nand the contextual value becomes\n\u03bb\u03c9 (A) =\n\nah\u03c9|A|\u03c8i + bh\u03c8|A|\u03c9i\n.\nah\u03c9|\u03c8i + bh\u03c8|\u03c9i\n\n(6)\n\nSo far our discussion for the value of a physical quantity has not touched upon probabilistic interpretation. At this\nstage we formally introduce the concept of probability following the standard probability theory of Kolmogorov [9].\nWe use the formula for the expectation value of an observable A \u2208 N ,\nX\nP\u0303 (\u03c9)\u03bb\u03c9 (A),\n(7)\nEx(A) =\n\u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303\n\nwhere the contextual value \u03bb\u03c9 (A) of A in \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9\u0303 is given by (6). The expectation value Ex(A) is an average of the\ncontextual value \u03bb\u03c9 (A) over the context of measurement {|\u03c9i}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 . The \u03bb\u03c9 (A) corresponds to the random variable\nfor an observable A in the probability theory. Each \u03bb\u03c9 (A) depends on |\u03c9i and therefore on how we choose the context\nVmax , but the averaging washes out the dependence on the choice of the context, i.e., how we choose the set of the\nstates to be post-selected. We shall show that the condition (iv) leads to a further specification of W\u03c9 , i.e., b = 0 in\n(5) so that\nW\u03c9 = |\u03c8ih\u03c9|.\n\n(8)\n\nWe now state and prove our main result.\nTheorem. A map \u03bb\u03c9 : N \u2192 C satisfying the above conditions (i)-(iv) is of the form\n\u03bb\u03c9 (A) =\n\nh\u03c9|A|\u03c8i\n, for \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9\u0303,\nh\u03c9|\u03c8i\n\n(9)\n\nand the probability measure is\nP\u0303 (\u03c9) = |h\u03c9|\u03c8i|2 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe contextual value (9) is identical to the weak value of Aharonov with |\u03c8i and h\u03c9| being the pre-selected state\nand the post-selected state, respectively. By this identification, we explicitly see that the context can be interpreted\nas a set of post-selected states. Note that the probability measure P is a matter of choice in the classical probability\ntheory, while Born's rule (10) is mandatory in quantum mechanics and even its non-negativity is an important aspect\nof the consequence. The asymmetry of h\u03c9| and |\u03c8i in (8) comes from the expression for the expectation value (7) in\nwhich the post-selected states are summed up on the basis of an intuition that we can choose a pre-selected state but\nits outcome is uncertain. The arrow of time is built-in in (7). The expression (7) for the expectation value with (8)\nand (10) reproduces the standard quantum mechanical expectation value,\nEx(A) = h\u03c8|A|\u03c8i,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich certainly does not depend on theP\ncontext {|\u03c9i}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 . The apparent context dependence of Ex(A) in (7) goes away\nby the completeness relation on |\u03c8i:\n\u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303 h\u03c8|\u03c9ih\u03c9|A|\u03c8i = h\u03c8|A|\u03c8i. It is instructive to think about the possibility\nP\nP\n2\nP\u0303 (\u03c9) = |h\u03c9|\u03c8i|4 instead of (10). Then we would have Ex(A) = \u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303 |h\u03c9|\u03c8i|4 h\u03c9|A|\u03c8i\n\u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303 |h\u03c9|\u03c8i| h\u03c8|\u03c9ih\u03c9|A|\u03c8i.\nh\u03c9|\u03c8i =\nThe context dependence would not go away. We can follow the exact parallel way also for the variance V ar(A) to\nconfirm its context independence.\n\n\f4\nProof. Consider a functional\nLE (h\u03c9|, \u03bc) := Ex(A) \u2212\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u03bci [\n\ni=0\n\nX\n\nh\u03c8i |\u03c9ih\u03c9|A|\u03c8i \u2212 h\u03c8i |A|\u03c8i],\n\n\u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303\n\n\u03bci \u2208 R,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03bci are the Lagrange multipliers and {|\u03c8i i} is a complete orthonormal system which contains |\u03c8i = |\u03c80 i as a\nunit vector. The Lagrange multiplier terms give constraints\nX\nh\u03c8i |\u03c9ih\u03c9|A|\u03c8i \u2212 h\u03c8i |A|\u03c8i = 0, \u2200 i, \u2200A \u2208 N .\n(13)\n\u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303\n\nSince {|\u03c8i i} is a complete\nP orthonormal system and A \u2208 N is arbitrary, the above constraints are equivalent to the\ncompleteness relation \u03c9\u2208\u03a9 |\u03c9ih\u03c9| = 1 for {|\u03c9i}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 as we see comparing with its matrix elements with (13) .\nWe demand that the variation of LE (h\u03c9|, \u03bc) with respect to h\u03c9| should vanish. That is,\n\u03b4LE (h\u03c9|, \u03bc)\n=\n\u03b4h\u03c9|\n\n\u2202 P\u0303 (\u03c9) ah\u03c9|A|\u03c8i+bh\u03c8|A|\u03c9i\n\u2202h\u03c9|\nah\u03c9|\u03c8i+bh\u03c8|\u03c9i\n\n\u2212 P\u0303 (\u03c9) ah\u03c9|A|\u03c8i+bh\u03c8|A|\u03c9i\n(ah\u03c9|\u03c8i+bh\u03c8|\u03c9i)2 a|\u03c8i \u2212\n\naA|\u03c8i\n+ P\u0303 (\u03c9) ah\u03c9|\u03c8i+bh\u03c8|\u03c9i\n\nP\n\ni\n\n\u03bci h\u03c8i |\u03c9iA|\u03c8i = 0. \u2200A \u2208 N\n\nP\u0303 (\u03c9)\nA particular choice A = |\u03c8ih\u03c8| implies that \u2202\u2202h\u03c9|\n\u221d |\u03c8i, since the second, third and fourth terms are then\n\u221d |\u03c8i. To see the implication of the component of the above equation perpendicular to |\u03c8i consider the case\nA = |\u03c8 \u22a5 ih\u03c8| + |\u03c8ih\u03c8 \u22a5 |, where |\u03c8 \u22a5 i is a state orthogonal to |\u03c8i to find that the second and the forth terms cancel\neach other. We therefore see that the sum of the first and the third terms and the sum of the second and the fourth\nterms separately vanish, i.e.,\n\u2202 P\u0303 (\u03c9)\n\u2202h\u03c9|\n\n\u2212\n\nP\u0303 (\u03c9)\nah\u03c9|\u03c8i+bh\u03c8|\u03c9i a|\u03c8i\n\na\nP\u0303 (\u03c9) ah\u03c9|\u03c8i+bh\u03c8|\u03c9i\n\n\u2212\n\nP\n\ni\n\n= 0,\n\n\u03bci h\u03c8i |\u03c9i = 0.\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nAdding these two equations yields\n\u2202 P\u0303 (\u03c9) X\n\u03bci h\u03c8i |\u03c9i|\u03c8i\n=\n\u2202h\u03c9|\ni\n\n(16)\n\nP\nand its integration gives P\u0303 (\u03c9) = i \u03bci h\u03c8i |\u03c9ih\u03c9|\u03c8i + P\u03030 , where P\u03030 is an integration constant. Therefore, (15) becomes\nX\nX\na\n\u03bci h\u03c8i |\u03c9ih\u03c9|\u03c8i + P\u03030 )\n(\n\u03bci h\u03c8i |\u03c9i = 0, \u2200\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9\u0303.\n(17)\n\u2212\nah\u03c9|\u03c8i + bh\u03c8|\u03c9i\ni\ni\n(h\u03c9|,\u03bc)\nThis implies that P\u03030 = 0 and b = 0. We note that \u03b4LE\u03b4|\u03c9i\n= 0 is automatically satisfied. Therefore, the context\ninvariance of the expectation value Ex(A) leads to expressions for the probability measure and the contextual value\nof an observable A as\nP\n(18)\nP\u0303 (\u03c9) = i \u03bci h\u03c8i |\u03c9ih\u03c9|\u03c8i,\n\n(19)\n\u03bb\u03c9 (A) = h\u03c9|A|\u03c8i\nh\u03c9|\u03c8i .\nP\nWe further demand that the variance V ar(A) = \u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303 P\u0303 (\u03c9)|\u03bb\u03c9 (A)|2 is context independent. To simplify the discussion we set Ex(A) = 0 or replace A by A \u2212 Ex(A). It is possible to set up a similar variational problem for V ar(A)\nto the previous one for Ex(A). Instead we simply insert the result of (19) into the expression for V ar(A) to obtain\nP\nV ar(A)\n= \u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303 P\u0303 (\u03c9)|\u03bb\u03c9 (A)|2\nP\nP\n2\n= \u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303 i \u03bci h\u03c8i |\u03c9ih\u03c9|\u03c8i| h\u03c9|A|\u03c8i\nh\u03c9|\u03c8i |\nP\nP\ni |\u03c9i\n= \u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303 i \u03bci h\u03c8\n(20)\nh\u03c8|\u03c9i h\u03c9|A|\u03c8ih\u03c8|A|\u03c9i.\nThis is independent of the context {|\u03c9i}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 if and only if \u03bci = 0 for i 6= 0. The remaining parameter \u03bc0 is fixed to\nP\nbe unity by the normalization condition \u03c9\u2208\u03a9\u0303 P\u0303 (\u03c9) = \u03bc0 = 1. Then we arrive at the main theorem (9) and (10).\n\nNow we can naturally extend the probability space (\u03a9\u0303, F\u0303 , P\u0303 ) to (\u03a9, F , P ) as follows. The sample space is \u03a9, and\nthe \u03c3-field F over \u03a9 is the power set of \u03a9. P is the probability measure over F satisfying the following conditions:\nP |F\u0303 = P\u0303 , P |F \\F\u0303 = 0. From the theorem, we can write P (\u03c9) = |h\u03c9|\u03c8i|2 . Thus the probability space (\u03a9, F , P )\ndescribes the standard quantum mechanical statistics in the context {|\u03c9i}\u03c9\u2208\u03a9 .\n\n\f5\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe have shown that the contextual value of an observable is the weak value by demanding the consistency of\nquantum mechanics with Kolmogorov's measure theory of probability in conjunction with the consideration of the\nvalues of obsevables. The crucial requirement was that the expectation value and the variance of an observable\nshould be independent of the way of measurement. This leads eventually to Born's rule in quantum mechanics. The\nassumptions of the sum rule (i) and the product rule (ii) may not have much problem and the invariance (iv) of the\nexpectation value and the variance is crucial to relate the contextual value to the concept of probability. The third\nassumption (iii) is debatable. At the moment we do not have complete justification. We believe the usefulness of (iii)\nto characterize the contextual value.\nGoing back to the original motivation in the introduction, we would like to examine in what sense the weak value\ncan be regarded as the value before projective measurements. Let A(t) be an operator at time t \u2264 T in the Heisenberg\nrepresentation, where T is the time of the projective measurement. We choose A(T ) as an element of Vmax so that\nthe post-selected state ha| is an eigenstate of A(T ), ha|A(T ) = ha|a of the eigenvalue a. The weak value\nha|A(t)|\u03c8i\nha|\u03c8i\n\n(21)\n\ncan be interpreted as the value before projective measurement provided that ha| is not orthogonal to the pre-selected\nstate |\u03c8i. At t = T , the weak value (21) coincides with the eigenvalue a. As stressed before the weak value depends\non the context, i.e., the states to be post-selected. The price is that the contextual value is complex in general.\nThe extension of the derivation of Born's rule to the mixed state case is straightforward but technically involved so\nthat we postpone it for future publication.\nFrom the main theorem we see that the value of an observable is given by the weak value (9). As is by now well\nknown, the weak value is experimentally accessible [12\u201321] and theoretically analyzed by many people [22\u201325]. The\nweak value coincides with one of eigenvalues when the observable is restricted to the maximal abelian subalgebra\nVmax \u2208 V(N )max . For a general A \u2208 N , the weak value can be deduced from the information associated with the\nstate to be post-selected, which is circumstantially inferred from the set of eigenvalues to be obtained by projective\nmeasurements of all the elements of Vmax .\nThe Kochen-Specker theorem [26] tells us that it is not possible to assign non-contextual values to all observables\nin quantum mechanics. Since the only non-contextual values are eigenvalues of the observables, this theorem does not\napply to the weak values. Actually the weak value is explicitly dependent on the context defined by the post-selected\nstates.\nIn the proof of Gleason's theorem [27], he demanded that the measure over the set of all the subspaces of the Hilbert\nspace H should be independent of the choice of basis in order to conclude that the measure has a quadratic form in\nthe state vector components if dim(H) \u2265 3. This leads to the standard expression for the expectation value. There\nis a gap between the probability and the measure over the set of all the subspaces of the Hilbert space H, so that\nthe derived Born's rule lacks the probabilistic interpretation. In a mathematical sense, Gleason's theorem is close to\nours. We believe that we have filled the gap by introducing the physical concept of the contextual value of observables\ndefined by the prepared state and the states to be post-selected. A rather surprising finding in the present work is\nthat the contextual value coincides with the weak value.\nZurek [28] claimed that he derived Born's rule from \"the environment assisted invariance\". He considered an\nentangled state\n|\u03c8i =\n\n|s1 i|e1 i + |s2 i|e2 i\n\u221a\n,\n2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere |s1 i and |s2 i are the orthonormal basis of the system, while |e1 i and |e2 i are the orthonormal basis of the\nenvironment. Consider an observable: A \u2297 1 with A = |s1 ihs1 | \u2212 |s2 ihs2 |. The elementary events are x1 := {hs1 |he1 |}\nand x2 := {hs2 |he2 |}. The sample space is \u03a9\u2032 := {x1 , x2 }, and the \u03c3-field is the power set of \u03a9\u2032 . We would like to show\nthat the probabilities to obtain x1 and x2 are 1/2. To see this we compute the weak values: \u03bbx1 (A) = 1, \u03bbx2 (A) = \u22121.\nWe apply the formula (7) noting that the left hand side is zero because of symmetry under the SWAP operation of\nthe states of 1 and 2 both for the system and environment. The operator A \u2297 1 does not distinguish the state of\nenvironment so that the expectation value has to be symmetric under the SWAP of the system state. Then we\nsee that P (x1 ) \u2212 P (x2 ) = 0 on the right had side and arrive at the equal probability P (x1 ) = P (x2 ) = 1/2, using\nEx(1) = P (x1 ) + P (x2 ) = 1. In this simple case, only the discrete symmetry is sufficient to derive Born's rule.\nHere we see that the symmetry principle should apply to the expectation value to obtain Born's rule. The role of\nentanglement with the environment is not clear for us, though we suspect a possible connection to the post-selection.\n\n\f6\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe present work has been inspired by the stimulating lecture by Professor Andreas D\u00f6ring at Nagoya.
