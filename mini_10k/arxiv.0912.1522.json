Secondly, the\namplitudes of the bright signal pulses are reamplified at each repeater station. This latter variation is\na strategy reminiscent of classical repeaters and would be impossible in single-photon-based schemes.\n\nThe maximum distance for experimental quantum\ncommunication is currently about 250 km [1, 2]. Although extensions to slightly larger distances are possible based on present experimental approaches [3], truly\nlong-distance quantum communication, similar to classical communication networks on inter-continental scale,\nwould require turning the theoretical in-principle solution of a quantum repeater [4, 5] into a real implementation [6]. This, however, would be possible only provided that highly sophisticated subprotocols such as efficient entanglement distillation [7, 8] and at the same time\nsufficient quantum memories [9] are within experimental\nreach; only with these extra ingredients can we circumvent the otherwise exponential decay of either communication rates or fidelities in the presence of channel losses.\nThere are several proposals for implementing a quantum repeater [4, 5, 10, 11, 12], utilizing different physical systems, and varying in their consumption of spatial\nversus temporal resources. In all these schemes, some\nkind of heralding mechanism is needed in order to conditionally distribute entangled pairs between neighboring\nrepeater stations. Among other classifications, for our\npurpose, it is useful to divide these schemes into two categories: one, where single photons are used to distribute\nentanglement, and another one, where bright optical coherent states are exploited (\"hybrid quantum repeater\"\n[12], HQR). In the former class of repeaters, as vacuum\ncontributions and photon losses would mainly affect the\ndistribution efficiencies and not the quality of the created\npairs, the heralding probabilities are typically fairly low,\nbut initial fidelities are naturally quite high. Conversely,\nthe quality of the bright-light-based pair distribution is\nvery sensitive to losses; hence fidelities are modest, but\npostselection efficiencies are reasonably high.\nFor realizing a full quantum repeater, however, it is\na priori not obvious which approach is preferable (especially, when imperfect quantum memories are consid-\n\nered): that leading to high-fidelity initial entanglement\nat low rates or that based upon higher initial distribution efficiencies at the expense of lower initial fidelities.\nNonetheless, in general, the globally optimal quantum\nrepeater protocol (achieving a certain target fidelity for\nlong-distance pairs at an optimal rate) would always combine optimal subprotocols for entanglement distribution,\ndistillation, and connection [13]. Hence distribution of\nentangled pairs between neighboring stations should occur at an optimal rate for a whole range of useful shortdistance fidelities. This tunability of optimal efficiency\nversus fidelity, and, in particular, near-unit fidelity pair\ndistribution is impossible to obtain in the HQR scheme\nbased on coherent states and homodyne detection [12].\nThere were several proposals for modifying the original HQR scheme, mainly differing in the type of measurements used. These variations then do allow for tunability\nand near-unit fidelity entanglement distribution; but the\nrequired POVMs involve experimentally demanding nonGaussian detection schemes such as cat-state projections\n[14], photon-number resolving detectors or, at least, detectors discriminating between vacuum and non-vacuum\nstates [15, 16]. A benchmark on the fidelity versus success probability plane can be derived, based upon the\nnon-Gaussian POVM achieving optimal, error-free unambiguous state discrimination (USD) of coherent states\n[15]. This benchmark covers the whole range of useful fidelities and it can be approached or even attained\nthrough non-Gaussian photon detectors [15, 16].\nIn the present work, we address the question whether\nit is possible to switch back from the rather demanding and less practical non-Gaussian schemes to a scheme\nfully based on Gaussian resources and operations without loss of performance. We answer this question to the\naffirmative and, in particular, we show that even the\ncoherent-state USD benchmark can be beaten in a Gaussian protocol that allows for just the right amount of\n\n\f2\ni\u03b8(\u22121)k\n\nFIG. 1: Entanglement distribution using squeezed-state\n(|\u03b1, \u03bei) communication with reamplification (D\u0302(\u03b2)). Reamplified phase-rotated squeezed states can be better discriminated through homodyne detection than unamplified coherent\nstates.\n\nmeasurement-induced overlap errors. For this we introduce two innovations involving Gaussian resources: the\nuse of optical squeezed states instead of coherent states;\nand the reamplification of the signal amplitude at each\nrepeater station. Squeezing improves the distinguishability of the final states along certain directions in phase\nspace, see Fig. 1. Reamplification is a strategy reminiscent of classical repeaters \u2013 a modification that would be\nimpossible in single-photon-based schemes.\nHere we optimize Gaussian communication for the\nHQR scheme with the only restriction that the initial\nprobe beam is in a pure state, and under the natural assumption that the initial squeezing direction and the final\nquadrature projection axis coincide. We will combine ingredients already exploited in Ref. [12], i.e., dispersive\natom-light interactions, a beam splitter loss model, and\nhomodyne detection with squeezing and reamplification.\nIdeal qubit-qumode interactions\u2013 For the initial entanglement distribution in an HQR, two neighboring stations\nare each equipped with a cavity containing a two-level\nsystem (qubit)[26] and connected by a channel that can\ncarry a quantized optical mode (qumode). The qumode\nis initially in a displaced squeezed vacuum state, |\u03b1, \u03bei =\nD\u0302(\u03b1)\u015c(\u03be)|0i, with \u03be = rei\u03c0 , real parameters \u03b1 and r,\nand the displacement and squeezing operators D\u0302(\u03b1) and\n\u015c(\u03be), respectively\n[17]. The initial atomic states are each\n\u221a\n(|0i + |1i)/ 2. Now a dispersive off-resonant interaction,\n\u00dbint = exp(i\u03b8n\u0302\u03c3z /2), on the first qubit, where n\u0302 is the\nphoton number and \u03c3z = |0ih0| \u2212 |1ih1| the Pauli Z operator,hleads to a conditional\nphase-rotation of the qumode,\ni\n|0i\u2297|\u03b10 ,\u03be0 i+|1i\u2297|\u03b11 ,\u03be1 i\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u00dbint |0i+|1i\n\u2297\n|\u03b1,\n\u03bei\n=\nwith\n2\n2\n\n[26] as for the discrete spin variables we may refer to \"atoms\", although these could as well be quantum dots, donor impurities in\nsemiconductors, etc.\n\nk\n\n\u03b1k = e 2 \u03b1, \u03bek = e(\u22121) i\u03b8 \u03be, where k = 0, 1. After this\nfirst interaction, the qumode travels to the other cavity\nand interacts with the second qubit in a similar way. For\na loss-free channel, the final qubit\u2013qubit\u2013qumode state\n\u0002\nis given by |0i|0i|ei\u03b8 \u03b1, e2i\u03b8 \u03bei + |1i|1i|e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03b1, e\u22122i\u03b8 \u03bei +\n\u0001\n\u0003\n|0i|1i + |1i|0i |\u03b1, \u03bei /2. By measuring the qumode in\nan appropriate way one can distinguish its initial state\n|\u03b1, \u03bei from the phase-rotated states and conditionally create an entangled state between the two cavities [12].\nLossy channels\u2013 In the realistic scenario, two neighboring repeater stations are separated at least by a distance of 10 \u2212 20 km, linked by a lossy channel of this\nlength. Thus, the qumode will be subject to attenuation and thermalization, especially when its initial state\ndiffers from a pure coherent state. In order to describe\nthe resulting mixed-state density matrices, we define the\noperator L\u0302jk [see Eq. (2) in Appendix \"Methods\"]; it\ncharacterizes our system after the interaction in the first\ncavity and the transmission through the lossy channel\n(derivation of L\u0302jk and more details about the noise model\ncan also be found in the Appendix).\nWhile decoherence or thermalization are unavoidable\nin the lossy channel, the effect of attenuation may be\ncorrected by an additional displacement operation D\u0302(\u03b2).\nThus, before the interaction in the second cavity, we displace the light field by a suitably chosen, real \u03b2. The\ntotal state of the system (qumode and two qubits) after\nthe second interaction is given by\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\n1\nX\n\n|j, lihk, m|e\n\nl\ni\u03b8n\u0302\n2 (\u22121)\n\nD\u0302(\u03b2)L\u0302jk D\u0302\u2020 (\u03b2)e\n\nm\ni\u03b8n\u0302\n2 (\u22121)\n\n, (1)\n\nl,m,j,k=0\n\nwhere the l, m indices label the atomic states in the second cavity, while the indices j, k refer to the first cavity. Now measuring the qumode subsystem of \u03c1\u0302 leads\nto a conditional 4 by 4 two-qubit density matrix. In\nthe\nZ case of homodyne detection of the p quadrature,i.e.,\npc\n\nhp|\u03c1\u0302|pi dp, we effectively select from \u03c1\u0302 those terms\n\u221a\ncorresponding to a mixture of |\u03a8\u00b1 i = (|01i \u00b1 |10i)/ 2\nBell states; the resulting phase-flip errors (\u00b1) stem from\nphoton losses, minimal for small amplitudes \u03b1; the finite\noverlaps of the Gaussian peaks in the homodyne-based\napproach lead to additional bit-flip errors, minimized for\nlarge amplitudes \u03b1 [15]. However, in our generalized\nscheme, we have as additional parameters the squeezing\nr and the reamplification amplitude \u03b2, which have a significant impact on the above trade-off between channel\ndecoherence and homodyne-based Gaussian-state distinguishability.\nThe final fidelity compared to the ideal Bell state |\u03a8+ i\n\u2212pc\n\n\f3\nZ\n\npc\n\nPs\n\nh\u03a8+ |hp|\u03c1\u0302|pi|\u03a8+ i dp/Ps . The nor\u0014Z pc\n\u0015\nmalization factor, Ps = Tr\nhp|\u03c1\u0302|pi dp , after tracing\nnow becomes F =\n\n\u2212pc\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n\u2212pc\n\nover the conditional qubit states, determines the probability of success, i.e., how frequently we actually obtain a\nmeasurement result within the postselection window 2pc .\nExact expressions for F and Ps are given in the Appendix\n[Eqs. (3), (4)].\nResults\u2013 Although the fidelity F [Eq. (3)] is a highly\noscillating function, we shall focus on its upper envelope\nFAbs , calculated from F by taking the absolute value instead of the real part of the last term in Eq. (3), as we\nmay always \"undo\" the corresponding local phase (see\nRefs. [12, 21] for details). From now on we assume fixed\nphase shift \u03b8 = 0.01 and transmission T , with losses corresponding to 0.17 dB/km. The fidelity then becomes\na function of the squeezing parameter r, the initial amplitude \u03b1, the displacement \u03b2, and the selection window\n2pc . Varying \u03b1, \u03b2, r for every pc , the maximum of FAbs\ncan be found. The plots in Fig. 2 show the maximal FAbs\nwith corresponding Ps for different distances between repeater stations. We see that now near-unit fidelities can\nbe achieved owing to squeezing and reamplification: for\nthe selection window pc \u2192 0, the maximal fidelities approach unity, at the expense of success probabilities tending to zero. This regime was previously accessible only\nthrough non-Gaussian measurements such as USD or in\nconceptually different single-photon-based schemes.\nFidelity\n1\n\nPs\n0.5\n\n0.9\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.3\n\n10 km\n\n0.7\n\n15 km\n25 km\n\n0.5\n\n15 km\n20 km\n25 km\n1\n1.5\n\n0.2\npc =0.1\n\n0.1\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\npc\n\n1\n\n\u0392=50, r=1,5\n\u0392=50, r=0\n\u0392=0, r=0\n\nFidelity\n\n0.8\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n500\n\n300\n\n200\n\u0391\n\n100\n\npc =0.1\n\n0.5\n\n10 km\n400\n\n\u0392=110, r=1,5\n\u0392=110, r=0\n\u0392=0, r=0\n\n0.9\n\n0.7 pc =0.1\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nUSD bound \u0099\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n\n0.85\n\nreamplification, and homodyne detection performs better then those based on single-photon detectors.

The\nrank-2 mixtures there [15] are typically easier to purify\nthan the full rank-4 mixtures obtained from both photonloss-induced phase-flip and measurement-induced bit-flip\nerrors as in our scheme. We leave a full analysis, incorporating our scheme into a complete HQR including rank-4\npurifications and swappings for future research. The reason why in our scheme we can suppress the loss-induced\nerrors to a great extent is because we may keep the initial\namplitudes \u03b1 relatively small, but still have only small\namounts of measurement-induced errors owing to squeezing and reamplification.\nWe note that different from existing proposals for distributing discrete entanglement through dynamical entanglement transfer from two-mode squeezed [18] or general two-mode states [19] to discrete systems, our scheme\nmakes explicit use of weak (dispersive, off-resonant) lightmatter interactions and employs local measurements including postselection; photon losses are primarily assumed to occur in the channel as a limiting factor to the\ncommunication distance, instead of distance-independent\ndissipation during the local interactions [18, 19, 20].\nRealistic qubit-qumode interactions\u2013 Finally, we address the question whether the idealized, controlled\nphase-rotation in our scheme can be indeed approximately realized; especially, when the qumode starts in\na nonclassical, squeezed state. First of all, the effective\nJaynes-Cummings-based interaction for the limiting case\nof large detuning in the off-resonant, dispersive regime\nholds for any input state of the qumode. However, in a\ncavity-QED setting, the internal cavity mode and the external fields are no longer identical; in particular, atomic\nspontaneous emissions (unwanted in-out couplings) and a\nfinite desired cavity in-out coupling have to be taken into\naccount. The master equation derived in Ref. [21] under\nthe Born approximation holds for any qumode state; in\n\nthe relevant regime of \u03b1 values, semi-classical calculations are sufficient, however, we have to assume that a\nsqueezed state coupled into the cavity at least remains\na Gaussian state at all times. As a result, non-Gaussian\neffects become negligible, similar to the case of coherentstate inputs of Ref. [21]. The crucial parameter is then\na sufficiently large cooperativity (\"good coupling / dissipation\") at weak or intermediate coupling.\nSqueezing may even turn out to be beneficial for the\nfidelity of the dispersive interaction [22]. In our model,\ncoupling inefficiencies may be absorbed into the transmission parameter T , corresponding to reduced distances.\nAlternatively, the optical squeezing operation may be\npostponed until the very end, performed online [23]\non phase-rotated coherent states. Besides CQED, approaches less sensitive to local dissipations may involve\nfree-space light-matter couplings [24, 25].\nAcknowledgements\u2013 P.v.L. wants to thank Bill Munro\nand Kae Nemoto for their support when this research line\nwas initiated.

Then the qumode interacts with the atom in the second cavity, and is finally detected by a\nhomodyne measurement of the p-quadrature. In our notation, we have x\u0302 = (\u00e2 + \u00e2\u2020 )/2, p\u0302 = (\u00e2 \u2212 \u00e2\u2020 )/(2i); corresponding to a\ncommutator [x\u0302, p\u0302] = i/2.
