The hard part forms the partonic\namplitude of the subprocess at a large value of the momentum transfer and is amenable to QCD\nperturbation theory. The soft part depends on the distribution amplitude of the hadron(s) and\ncontains the dynamics at typical hadronic scales; it has, therefore, to be determined by nonperturbative methods or be extracted from experimental data. The collinear factorization applied\nto the transition form factor (FF) of two far off-shell photons to a pion leads to the convolution\nof these two parts, which, at the leading order of twist two, reads (x\u0304 \u2261 1 \u2212 x)\n\u221a\nZ 1\n1\n2\n\u03b3\u2217\u03b3\u2217\u03c0\n2 2\nf\u03c0\n\u03c6\u03c0 (x) dx + O(1/Q4 )\n(1)\nF\n(Q , q ) =\n2 x\u0304 + q 2 x\n3\nQ\n0\nmodulo twist-four terms, ignored here. The main ingredient of the above equation is the pion\nDA \u03c6\u03c0 (x) which encodes all unknown binding effects of the pion state. At the considered level\nof twist two, it is defined by the following universal matrix element [1]\n\u03bc\n \u0304\nh0|d(z)\u03b3\n\u03b35 [z, 0]u(0)|\u03c0(P )i|z 2 =0 = if\u03c0 P \u03bc\n\nZ\n\n1\n0\n\neix(z*P ) \u03c6(t=2)\n(x, \u03bc20 ) dx ,\n\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere x is the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the valence quark (x\u0304 for the antiquark)\nin the pion and the path-ordered exponential, i.e., the light-like gauge link,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ z\n\u03bc\na a\nt A\u03bc (y) dy ,\n[z, 0] = P exp \u2212ig\n(3)\n0\n\n\u2217\n\nInvited talk given by the second author at \"QUARKS-2010, 16th International Seminar on High Energy\nPhysics\", Kolomna, Russia, 6-12 June, 2010.\n\u2020\ne-mail: mikhs@theor.jinr.ru\n\u2021\ne-mail: pimikov@theor.jinr.ru\n\u00a7\ne-mail: stefanis@tp2.ruhr-uni-bochum.de\n\n1\n\n\fensures gauge invariance. It is useful to expand the pion DA in terms of the Gegenbauer har3/2\nmonics 6xx\u0304 Cn (2x\u22121) which provide the eigenfunctions of the one-loop Efremov-RadyushkinBrodsky-Lepage (ERBL for short) evolution equation [2, 3]. One finds for \u03c6(t=2) at the typical\nhadronic scale \u03bc20 :\nh\ni\n3/2\n3/2\n\u03c6(t=2) (x; \u03bc20 ) = \u03c6Asy (x) 1 + a2 (\u03bc20 ) C2 (2x \u2212 1) + a4 (\u03bc20 ) C4 (2x \u2212 1) + . . . ,\n(4)\nin which the asymptotic (abbreviated by Asy) pion DA appears: \u03c6Asy (x) = 6xx\u0304. By virtue\nR 1 (t=2)\nof the leptonic decay \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc , one obtains the normalization 0 \u03c6\u03c0\n(x, \u03bc20 ) dx = 1, which\nfixes a0 = 1.\nWhile a process involving two photons with large virtualities is theoretically preferable, because one can safely apply QCD perturbation theory, experimentally, the asymmetric kinematic\nwith one of the photons being quasi real is more accessible. Indeed, such measurements have\nbeen carried out by several collaborations, namely, the CELLO [4], the CLEO [5], and, most\nrecently, the BaBar Collaboration [6]. Taking the limit q 2 \u2192 0 in convolution (1), one finds\nthat the FF for the \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 transition is actually given by the inverse moment of the pion\nDA\nZ 1\n1\n\u22121\n\u03c6\u03c0 (x) dx .\n(5)\nhx i\u03c0 =\n0 x\nTherefore, this quantity is one of the key elements of the pion-photon transition FF. Because\nthis form factor has such a simple structure within QCD, it has attracted over the years the\nattention of many theorists (see, e.g., [7\u201311] and references cited therein).\nHowever, the most recent measurement of this observable by the BaBar Collaboration [6]\nhas provided controversial results, because, unexpectedly, the high-energy data points above\n10 GeV2 grow with Q2 - see Fig. 1.

The pion is parameterized in terms of the\nfollowing DAs: Asy - dashed-doted line, BMS \"bunch\" [10] - shaded (green) strip, CZ model [12] - upper\nlong-dashed (red) line, flat-top model [13] - short-dashed (blue) line. Experimental data are shown on both\npanels using the following notations: BaBar data [6] - (red) boxes with error bars, CELLO data [4] - (black)\ndiamonds with error bars, CLEO\u221a\ndata [5] - (violet) triangles with error bars. The horizontal solid line denotes\nthe asymptotic QCD prediction 2f\u03c0 . The left panel provides a zoom-in view into the low and intermediate\nrange of Q2 , whereas the right panel shows the results for the whole interval of momenta probed by the BaBar\nexperiment.\n9 GeV2 (see the left panel of Fig. 1), the new high-precision BaBar data agree well with the\nprevious CLEO data [5]. From the second column of Table 1 and the left panel of Fig. 1, we\nmay conclude that all data up to 9 GeV2 can be best described by pion DAs that have their\nend-points strongly suppressed [11, 14]. A characteristic example of such a DA is provided\nby the Bakulev-Mikhailov-Stefanis (BMS) model [10], which has been derived from QCD sum\nrules (SR)s with nonlocal condensates (NLC)s, originally developed in [15]. In contrast, the\n2\n\n\fhigh-Q2 BaBar data (see the right panel of Fig. 1) show, as already mentioned, an unexpected\ngrowth with Q2 which cannot be understood on the basis of the collinear factorization and\ncalls (see the fifth column of Table 1)) for pion DAs that have instead their end-points strongly\nenhanced [13, 16]. This intriguing behavior has triggered the use of flat-type pion DAs and\nprovided the main motivation for our analysis in [17], on which we report here. The result\nobtained by Radyushkin [13] with the flat-top model (\u03c6\u03c0 (x) = 1) is shown in Fig. 1 as a dashed\n(blue) line in comparison with the BMS bunch (green strip) [10] and the CZ pion DA model\n(long-dashed line in red color) [12]. As we see from this figure, the high-Q2 BaBar data are\nrather well-described in Radyuskin's approach [13]. A recent independent analysis [18] comes\nto the conclusion that a flat pion DA, when used in a fully consistent way, yields to predictions\nfor the pion's electromagnetic and transition form factors which are in striking disagreement\nwith experiment.\nTable 1: Deviations of theoretical predictions for the quantity Q2 F \u03b3\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03b3\u03c0\n(Q2 ) in terms of \u03c7\u03042 \u2261 \u03c72 /ndf\n(ndf = number of degrees of freedom) for several pion model DAs: Asy, BMS model, and CZ model (more\ndetails in [11]). Predictions based on the flat-top model DA (18), discussed in [13], are also included. The second\ncolumn shows the results for the combined sets of the CLEO [5] and the CELLO [4] data above 1 GeV2 . The\nthird column compares model predictions with all data in the interval [1, 9] GeV2 , while the fourth column takes\ninto account only the BaBar data above 9 GeV2 .

As we shall explain in Sec. 3, QCD SRs were\nmainly developed with the purpose to study the integral characteristics of the pion DA. To\novercome this restriction, we constructed in [17] an operator for integral derivatives of the pion\nDA. The results obtained this way supplement those found with SRs which employ the standard\nderivative of the pion DA.\nOur presentation will concentrate on the following issues, organized in sections. In Sec. 2,\nwe discuss the QCD SR approach with NLCs and focus on the peculiarities of the pion DA in\nthe end-point region x \u223c 0. In Sec. 3 we define and study the integral derivative of the pion\nDA, the purpose being to overcome the restrictions inherent in QCD SRs which were created in\norder to probe the integral characteristics of the pion DA. In Sec. 4 we also study the SRs for\nthe standard derivative of the pion DA at the origin and complete our presentation by drawing\nour conclusions in Sec. 5.\n\n2\n\nSlope of the pion DA and the nonperturbative QCD vacuum\n\nAs already mentioned in the Introduction, the fine details of the pion DA in the region around\nthe origin x \u223c 0 are of crucial importance. To illustrate the differences in the end-point behavior\nof existing model DAs, we show the corresponding profiles in Fig. 2 (left panel). We depict four\nmodels: BMS [10] model - solid line; CZ [12] - dashed-dotted (blue) line; flat-top DA given\nby Eq. (18)-short-dashed (red) line; dotted line - asymptotic DA. Using the values of the\n3\n\n\fderivative of the pion DA, collected in the last column of Table 1, we can classify the pion DA\nmodels according to their end-point behavior: end-point suppressed (Asymptotic and BMS) and\nend-point enhanced (CZ and flat-top (18)). A zoomed-in view of the end-point characteristics\nof the above DAs is displayed in the right panel of Fig. 2.\n1.0\n\n\u03c6\u03c0 (x)\n1.5\n\n\u03c6\u03c0 (x)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n0.5\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\nx\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nx\n\n0.0\n0.00\n\n1.0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of selected pion DA models.

All DAs are normalized at the same scale \u03bc20 \u2243 1 GeV2 .\n\nRelying upon the QCD SR approach with NLCs, developed in [10], we direct our attention\nto the end-point behavior of the pion DA. This will allow us to obtain predictions for the slope\nof the pion DA in the end-point region with smaller errors than those obtained from the BMS\nbunch [10] in this region [17]. Recall that the basic idea underlying the NLC parametrization\nof the QCD vacuum, is that it has a domain structure, parameterized in terms of condensates,\nthe latter possessing a certain correlation length by virtue of which the vacuum quarks acquire a non-zero average virtuality hkq2 i (see, for instance, [19]). To analyze the nonlocality of\nthe vacuum condensate, it is useful to parameterize the lowest scalar condensate in terms of1\nhq\u0304(0)[0, z]q(z)i \u2261 MS (z 2 ). This quantity can be related to the vacuum distribution function\nfS (\u03b1) via [15]\nZ\u221e\n2\nMS (z ) = hq\u0304qi fS (\u03b1) e\u03b1z /4 d\u03b1 ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the vacuum-quark virtuality. Assuming that the vacuum quarks have a fixed virtuality \u03bb2q , one has\nfS (\u03b1) = \u03b4(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb2q /2) ,\n\n(7)\n\nleading for the scalar-quark condensate [15] to the Gaussian model\nMS (z 2 ) = hq\u0304(0)q(0)ie\u2212|z\n\n2 |\u03bb2 /8\nq\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThe parameter \u03bb2q here represents the typical quark momentum in the QCD vacuum and it can\nbe given the following definition\n2hkq2 i =\n\nhq\u0304(0)\u22072 q(0)i\n\u2261 \u03bb2q .\nhq\u0304(0)q(0)i\n\n(9)\n\nIn our study [17], presented here, we use the value \u03bb2q = 0.4 GeV2 , which is supported by several\nanalyses, though values within the interval [0.35 \u00f7 0.45] GeV2 are still acceptable (see [10,20,21]\nand references cited therein).\n1\n\nIn this work we use the \"fixed-point\" gauge z \u03bc A\u03bc = 0, so that [0, z] = 1.\n\n4\n\n\fThe QCD SRs with nonlocal condensates for the pion DA write [10]\n\u2212m2A /M 2\n\nf\u03c02 \u03c6\u03c0 (x) + fA2 1 \u03c6A1(x) e\n\n1\n\n+\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212s/M 2\n\n\u03c1pert (x) e\n\nds =\n\ns0\n2\n\nZ\u221e\n\n2\n\n\u03c1pert (x) e\u2212s/M ds\n\n0\n\n\u0003\n+\u2206\u03a6G(x, M ) + \u2206\u03a6S (x, M ) + \u2206\u03a6V (x, M ) + \u2206\u03a6T (x, M 2 ) Q ,\n\u0002\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03c6A1 is the A1 -meson DA and f\u03c0 and fA1 are, respectively, the decay constants of the\npion and the A1 -meson. Here and below we use M 2 notation for Borel parameter. Note\nthat the A1 -meson state is an effective state which takes into account both the \u03c0 \u2032 and the\na1 meson. The nonperturbative input in the theoretical part of the SR (right side) are the\ngluon-condensate term \u2206\u03a6G (x, M 2 ) and the quark-condensate contribution [...]Q . This latter\ncontribution contains the vector-condensate term (V), the mixed quark-gluon condensate term\n(T), and the scalar condensate term (S). The explicit expressions for the perturbative and the\n(NLO)\nnonperturbative contributions to the NLO spectral density \u03c1pert (x) can be found in [10, 17].\nRemarkably, the first radiative correction in the spectral density in the end-point region is of\nO(\u03b1s ) and comes out too large relative to both the zeroth-order perturbative contribution as\nwell as the nonperturbative parts. For this reason, we resort in our analysis [17] to the leading(LO)\norder (LO) approximation \u03c1pert (x) = 3xx\u0304/2\u03c0 2 . In fact, in order to include radiative corrections\ninto the spectral density (when analyzing the end-point region), one would be obliged to resum\nall radiative corrections - a formidable task for the future.\nAmong the nonperturbative terms, the scalar-quark condensate provides the largest smooth\ncontribution at the origin x \u223c 0, notably,\n\u2206\u03a6S (x, M 2 ) = 18AS (\u03a6\u2032 x + \u03a6\u2032\u2032 x2 + O(x3 ))\n\n(11)\n\n8\u03c0\u03b1S\nhq\u0304qi2 ,\n81\nZ \u221e\nZ 1/2\nZ \u221e\nt\nfS (\u03b1)\n\u22121\n2\n2\n2\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\ndt .

In contrast, the nonlocal condensate leads to an end-pointsuppressed nonperturbative contribution.\nIn using the SR (10) in order to study the end-point behavior of the pion DA, we have\nto find an appropriate characteristic that is capable of describing the slope of the pion DA at\nthe origin. Because the nonperturbative terms are strongly concentrated at the endpoints (see\nFig. 3), viz., \u2206\u03a6V \u223c x \u03b4\u2032 (\u2206 \u2212 x), \u2206\u03a6G \u223c \u03b4(\u2206 \u2212 x), . . . with \u2206 = \u03bb2q /(2M 2 ), the best way to\ntake into account all these contributions is to investigate the integral characteristics of the pion\nDA. For this reason we invented in [17] the \"integral derivative\", which will occupy us in the\nnext section.\nIf we apply the Gaussian model (8), then only the four-quark condensate \u2206\u03a6S \u223c x \u03b8(\u2206 \u2212 x)\ncontributes in the end-point region - see Fig. 3- without leading to singularities. But, if\nwe assume a behavior of the various condensates differing from the delta-ansatz model, and\nuse, for instance, for the scalar-quark condensate a smooth model like (21) (which implies a\ndecay at large distances not slower than the exponential decay), then the other nonperturbative\nterms (V), (G), and (T) contribute only small amounts in the small-x region. Therefore, these\nterms can be neglected if one is only interested in deriving the simplest characteristic, i.e., the\nderivative of the pion DA at the origin \u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0), considered in Sec. 4.\n5\n\n\f2\n\n\u2206\u03a6loc\nS (x)\n1.5\n\n\u03c1pert (x)\n\n1\n\n\u2206\u03a6NLC\n(x)\nS\n0.5\n\nx\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of the leading nonperturbative contribution in the local (\u2206\u03a6loc\nS (x)) and the nonlocal\n(\u2206\u03a6NLC\n(x)) condensate models along with the perturbative contribution (\u03c1pert (x)).\nS\n\n3\n\n\"Integral\" sum rules\n\nThe key features of the applied SRs are collected in Table 2. Because the QCD SRs were\ndeveloped with the aim to study the integral characteristics of the pion DA, most approaches\nappeal to the moments\nZ 1\nN\n(2x \u2212 1)N \u03c6\u03c0 (x) dx ,\n(13)\nh\u03be i\u03c0 \u2261\n0\n\nwhere \u03be \u2261 2x \u2212 1. Once these moments are known, they can be used in order to reverse\nengineer the pion DA, with a precision depending upon the influence of the magnitude of the\ndiscarded higher-order moments. The zero-order moment leads to a SR for the decay constant,\nstudied long ago by Shifman, Vainshtein and Zakharov [22]. The second-order term of the\nGegenbauer expansion was determined by Chernyak and Zhitnitsky [12] from the standard SRs\nwith local condensates (\u03bb2q = 0). Still higher-order coefficients were computed [10] using QCD\nSRs with NLCs. It was shown there that one can de facto resort to the first two Gegenbauer\ncoefficients a2 and a4 because the values of ai with i = 6, 8, 10 were calculated and found to\nbe negligible. On that basis, the authors of [10] obtained a bunch of two-parameter dependent\npion DAs, among them also the BMS model, mentioned earlier, and an independent SR for the\ninverse moment (5). The inverse moment itself is a rather good, though not sufficient (see for\narguments [23]), indicator for the end-point behavior of the pion DA, as we can see from the\nfifth column of Table 1.\nTable 2: Comparison of results for the moments of the pion DA obtained within different approaches which use\nQCD SRs with local or nonlocal condensates.\n\nApproach\n\nCharacteristics\n\nAccuracy\n\nCondensate\n\nResult\n\nSVZ [22]\n\nh\u03be 0 i\n\nLO\n\nlocal\n\nf\u03c0\n\nCZ [12]\n\nh\u03be 2N i, N = 0, 1\n\nLO\n\nlocal\n\nf\u03c0 , a2\n\nBMS [10]\n\nhx\u22121 i, h\u03be 2N i, N = 0, 1, . . . , 5\n\nNLO\n\nnonlocal\n\nf\u03c0 , a2 , a4 , hx\u22121 i\n\nHere [17]\n\n\u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0), [D (\u03bd) \u03c6\u03c0 ](x)\n\nLO\n\nnonlocal\n\n\u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0), [D (\u03bd) \u03c6\u03c0 ](x)\n\nIn our work [17] we probed the endpoint region of the pion DA in another way which\nemploys an averaged \"integral\" derivative. As we explained in Sec. 2, the usefulness of these\nderivatives follows from the fact that they can be applied to QCD SRs which may even contain\nsingular terms. With the help of the averaging procedure, one can take into account all these\ncontributions. To expose the usefulness of this procedure, let us construct the following sequence\n6\n\n\fof average derivatives obeying the condition \u03c6(0) = 0: standard derivative, finite-difference\nderivative, and generalized inverse moment given by\n[D\n\n(0)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c6](x) = \u03c6 (x) ,\n\n[D\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c6](x) = \u03c6(x)/x , and [D\n\n(2)\n\n1\n\u03c6](x) =\nx\n\nZx\n\n\u03c6(y)\ndy\ny\n\n(14)\n\n0\n\nrespectively. The integral derivatives D (\u03bd) , generalizing this sequence, were defined in [17] by\nmeans of the following expression:\n[D\n\n(\u03bd)\n\n1\n\u03c6](x) =\nx\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZx\n\u03b8(x \u2212 y)\nx \u03bd\nat \u03c6(0) = 0 .\n\u03c6(y)f (y, \u03bd \u2212 2, x) dy , f (y, \u03bd, x) =\nln\n\u0393(\u03bd + 1) y\ny\n\n(15)\n\n0\n\nWhen \u03bd = 2 and x = 1, the integral derivative coincides with the inverse moment of the pion\nDA: [D (2) \u03c6](1) = hx\u22121 i\u03c0 . Assuming that the Taylor expansion of \u03c6(x) at x = 0 exists, one\nfinds from (15)\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nx\nx\n(3)\n(\u03bd)\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03c6 (0) ,\n(16)\n[D \u03c6](x) = \u03c6 (0) + \u03c6 (0) \u03bd\u22121 + O\n2!2\n3\u03bd\u22121\nwhich is valid for any real \u03bd, as we explained in detail in [17]. From the above equation, one\ncan see that the defined operator D (\u03bd) reproduces at small x and/or large \u03bd the derivative of\n\u03c6(x) at the origin x = 0.\nBy applying the operator [D (\u03bd+2) ] on both sides of the QCD SR given by (10), we obtain a\nnew SR for [D (\u03bd+2) \u03c6\u03c0 ](x), viz.,\nf\u03c02 [D (\u03bd) \u03c6\u03c0 ](x)\n\n+\n\n\u2212m2 /M 2\nfA2 1 e A1\n[D (\u03bd) \u03c6A1 ](x)\n\nZ\u221e\n2\n+ [D (\u03bd) \u03c1pert ] (x) e\u2212s/M ds\ns0\n\n=\n\nZ\u221e\n\n2\n\n[D (\u03bd) \u03c1pert ] (x) e\u2212s/M ds + [D (\u03bd) \u2206\u03a6G ](x, M 2 ) + [D (\u03bd) \u2206\u03a6V ](x, M 2 )\n\n(17)\n\n0\n\n+ [D (\u03bd) \u2206\u03a6T ](x, M 2 ) + [D (\u03bd) \u2206\u03a6S ](x, M 2 ) .\nThe detailed analysis of this SR can be found in [17]. Here we only discuss the nonperturbative\nterms depicted in Fig. 4. The dominant contribution to the integral derivative [D (\u03bd) \u03c6\u03c0 ](0.5) of\nthe pion DA stems from the scalar-quark condensate (S), while the vector-condensate (V), the\nmixed quark-gluon condensate (T), and the gluon-condensate (GG) contributions are comparatively less important. It turns out that the image of the operator D (\u03bd) for \u03bd \u2265 6 is numerically\nvery close to the result obtained with the differentiation method (see next section) - for any\nx.\nFor large \u03bd, the (S)-term dominates and is close to the value obtained by the standard\nderivative illustrated in Fig. 4 by the horizontal line, while all other condensate terms disappear.\nThus, the integral SR (17) becomes close to the differential one to be considered in the next\nsection. For this reason, we analyze the constructed SR (17) for \u03bd \u2208 [2, 6] and x > 0.4 and\npresent the results in Fig. 5 in terms of a solid line that is inside the light gray strip bounded\nby the short-dashed lines. For the sake of comparison, the predictions for the asymptotic DA\n(dashed-dotted line) and the BMS DA bunch - obtained in the NLC SR analysis of Ref. [10]\n- (shaded band limited by long-dashed lines) are also shown. From this figure we see that our\nSR estimates for [D (\u03bd) \u03c6SR\n\u03c0 ](x) agree fairly well with the BMS model - see also Table 3. This\ntable shows estimates for the third-order integral derivative of the pion DA for x = 0.5, using\n(i) the sum rule given by Eq. (17) and (ii) the pion DA models we discussed above; in addition,\nresults pertaining to flat-type DAs are also included.\n7\n\n\f1.5 [D (\u03bd) \u2206\u03a6k ](0.5)/f\u03c02\n\nS\n\n1.0\n\nV\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\nGG\n\u03bd\n\nT\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 4: Mutual comparison of the nonperturbative contributions (k=S, V, T, and GG) to the SR (17) for\nthe integral derivatives [D(\u03bd) \u03c6\u03c0 ](x) of the pion DA and with the value 18AS \u03a6\u2032 /f\u03c02 = 72AS f\u03c0\u22122 \u03bb\u22124\n(horizontal\nq\nsolid line) of the scalar-quark contribution to the SR (19) for the standard derivative \u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0).

The other terms are the vector-quark condensate term\n(k=V) - dashed-dotted (green) line, the mixed quark-gluon condensate term (k=T) - dashed-dotted-dotted\n(red) line, and the gluon-condensate term (k=GG) - dotted (black) line.\nFirst, we compare the QCD SR result, obtained from (17), with what one finds with the\nflat-type DA models. Consider first the flat-top DA model defined by\n\u03c6flat (x) =\n\n\u0393(2(\u03b1 + 1)) \u03b1\nx (1 \u2212 x)\u03b1 .\n\u03932 (\u03b1 + 1)\n\n(18)\n\nThis model was invented in [13] and attempts to describe the BaBar data via a logarithmic\nbehavior with Q2 . For the value \u03b1 = 0.1, one finds [D (3) \u03c6flat ](0.5) = 227, which is much larger\nand far outside the range of values extracted from our SR (17).\nAs a second option, we consider a particular flat-type pion DA which is provided by the\nAdS/QCD correspondence in the holographic approach - see, for instance, Refs. [24\u201326]. In\nthat case one has \u03b1 = 0.5 yielding [D (3) \u03c6hol ](0.5) = 14.\nOn the other hand, the CZ model - being also endpoint-enhanced - yields third-order integral derivatives which are incompatible with the values derived from our SR (17) (cf. Table 3).\nNote that a similar statement also applies to the pion DA proposed in [27], which employs a\nBrodsky-Huang-Lepage ansatz for the k\u22a5 -dependence of the pion wave function - see Table 3.\nThe main message from this table is that the SR for the integral derivative of the pion DA is\n(3)\n8 [D \u03c6\u03c0 ](x)\n\n8\n\n6\n\n6\n\n[D (\u03bd) \u03c6\u03c0 ](0.5)\n\n4\n4\n\n2\n0\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nx\n-4\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n\u03bd\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 5: x-dependence (left panel) and \u03bd-dependence (right panel) of [D(\u03bd) \u03c6\u03c0 ](x) shown for the BMS bunch of\npion DAs [10] (shaded green band within long-dashed lines) in comparison with the SR result (17) (narrow gray\nstrip) in both panels.

By contrast, the pion DA model proposed in [27] - though it\nprovides a similarly large integral derivative like the CZ DA - has a usual derivative at the\norigin which is zero due to the strong exponential suppression of this DA in the small vicinity\nof the origin. Finally, the model DA defined by Eq. (18) has no derivative at the origin while\nthe integral derivative is well-defined. As we see from these examples, the integral derivative\nallows one to compare a broader range of the pion DA values in the end-point region than the\nstandard one.\nTable 3: Results for the third-order integral derivative at the value x = 0.5 and such for the standard derivative\nof the pion DA, using different SR approaches (first three rows) and pion DA models (six last rows).\n\nApproach/Model\n\n\"Integral derivative\" [D (3) \u03c6\u03c0 ](0.5)\n\nDerivative \u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0)\n\n1\n\nIntegral SR (17)\n\n4.7 \u00b1 0.5\n\n5.5 \u00b1 1.5\n\n2\n\nDifferential SR (19)\n\n-\n\n5.3 \u00b1 0.5\n\n3\n\nSR (19) with smooth NLC (21)\n\n-\n\n7.0 \u00b1 0.7\n\n4\n\nBMS bunch [10]\n\n5.7 \u00b1 1.0\n\n1.7 \u00b1 5.3\n\n5\n\nAsymptotic DA\n\n5.25\n\n6\n\n6\n\nCZ DA [28]\n\n15.1\n\n26.2\n\n7\n\nDA from [27]\n\n14\n\n0\n\n8\n\nAdS/QCD DA [24]\n\n14\n\n\u226b6\n\n9\n\nflat-top DA (Eq.

This quantity can be extracted from [D (\u03bd) \u03c6SR\n\u03c0 ](x),\nwhich can be derived from the SR (17) employing different values of \u03bd and x. The results\nare shown in Fig. 5. To determine \u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0) one can first use two terms of the Taylor expansion\n(16) and then subtract the second derivative for which the asymptotic value \u03c6\u2032\u2032\u03c0 (0) = \u221212(6) is\ntaken.

As it was shown in our recent work [17], only the\nfour-quark condensate survives and gives a contribution to the SR defined by Eq. (12). \u00bfFrom\nthis equation we see that the nonperturbative contribution to the SR is mainly due to the\nscalar-quark condensate at large/moderate distances z 2 & 4/hkq2 i. Employing the delta-ansatz\nfS (\u03b1) = \u03b4(\u03b1\u2212\u03bb2q /2) the nonperturbative contribution to SR (19) reduces to the following simple\nexpression\n\u03a6\u2032 = \u03a6\u2032delta =\n9\n\n4\n.\n\u03bb4q\n\n(20)\n\n\fHaving fixed the ingredients of the SR, we are now able to consider the implications of\nusing the smooth model for the quark-virtuality distribution in the differential SR. Despite the\nusefulness of the Gaussian model, we have to take into account the possibility that the scalarquark condensate may behave differently at asymptotically large distances. Indeed, there are\nindications from heavy-quark effective theory [29] that it could decay exponentially. Note that\nin order to ensure the existence of the vacuum matrix element hq\u0304(D 2 )N qi, the quark-virtuality\ndistribution fS (\u03b1) should decrease faster than any power 1/\u03b1N +1 as \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e [15]. Following\nthis reasoning, a two-tier model for fS was proposed in [21,30] which has a smooth dependence\non the quark virtuality \u03b1.

The two parameters\nn and \u039b are responsible for the large-z behavior of the scalar-quark condensate, cf. Eq. (22).\nThe third parameter \u03c3 2 = 10 GeV\u22122 is defined in terms of the parameters n, \u039b, and \u03bb2q via the\nfollowing equation\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03b1 fS (\u03b1; \u039b, n, \u03c3) d\u03b1 =\n0\n\n\u03bb2q\n\u039b Kn+1 (2\u039b\u03c3)\n=\n,\n\u03c3 Kn (2\u039b\u03c3)\n2\n\n(23)\n\nwhich we are going to evaluate for the value of the nonlocality parameter \u03bb2q = 0.4 GeV2 . The\nmain effect of using a smooth model for the quark-virtuality distribution in comparison to the\nGaussian form, fS (\u03b1) = \u03b4(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bb2q /2), is the increase of the nonperturbative contribution to the\nSR, induced this way, entailing the relation\nZ \u221e\nfS (\u03b1; \u039b, n, \u03c3)\n\u03c3 2 Kn\u22122 (2\u039b\u03c3)\n\u2032\n\u03a6smooth =\n(24)\nd\u03b1\n=\n> \u03a6\u2032delta .\n\u03b12\n\u039b2 Kn (2\u039b\u03c3)\n0\nWe studied the SR (19) for this model adopting the following values of its parameters:\nfS (\u03b1; \u039b = 0.45 GeV, n = 1, \u03c3 2 = 10 GeV\u22122 ). It turns out that the average value of the derivative\n\u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0, M 2 ) in the fiducial Borel interval is \u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0) = 7.0(7), meaning that the nonperturbative\ncontribution \u03a6\u2032smooth , obtained from the smooth model, is approximately two times larger than\nthe analogous contribution \u03a6\u2032delta for the delta ansatz \u03a6\u2032smooth \u2248 2.3 \u03a6\u2032delta . Appealing to the\nrelation (12), it seems reasonable to conclude that choosing a model for the condensate that has\na slower decay at large distances (small n or \u039b), may induce an increase of the nonperturbative\ncontribution to the SR (10) and, hence, entail an increase of the value \u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0) as well. The option\nof having a condensate model with a faster decay at large distances (large n or \u039b), leads to a\ndecrease of the nonperturbative contribution to the SR (10) and therefore to a decrease of the\nvalue \u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0). To facilitate the comparison of these two distinct possibilities for the scalar-quark\ncondensate, we give in the last column of Table 3 the values of the (usual) pion DA derivative\nat x \u2243 0, using various SR approaches (first three rows) and selected pion DA models (last six\nrows).\n10\n\n\f5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the present work we proposed a direct way to access the end-point characteristics of the pion\nDA in the QCD SR approach with nonlocal condensates. To characterize the slope of the pion\nDA at the origin, we introduced [17] a suitable operator for integral derivatives that allows us to\ndescribe a broader range of the pion DA in the end-point region than the standard derivative.\nMoreover this operator provides the possibility to include all condensate terms of the QCD SRs\nwith nonlocal condensates.\nOur results have been presented in the second and the third column of Table 3 for the range\nof values of the integral and the standard derivatives of the pion DA, respectively. The same\ntable contains also the values of the derivatives of some characteristic pion DA models, viz.,\nthe BMS, the CZ, the asymptotic, and the flat-top DA given by Eq. (18) with \u03b1 = 0.1. The\ndependence of the integral derivative on its parameters x and \u03bd is displayed in Fig. 5.\nFrom Table 3, we conclude that the differential (19) and the integral (17) SRs agree rather\nwell with each other. The integral and the standard derivatives of the pion DA, based on these\nnew SRs, give smaller values than the asymptotic one and overlapping with the range of values\ndetermined with the BMS bunch of pion DAs [10], while there is no agreement with the CZ DA\nand the considered flat-top model.\nIt is worth remarking that, employing the integral and the differential QCD SR (10)- which\nemploy the minimal Gaussian model for the nonlocal condensates - cannot be satisfied by flattype pion distribution amplitudes. Using a physically motivated exponential decay model by\nmeans of expression (21), leads to a higher value of the slope of the pion DA at the origin \u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0),\nthough it is still much smaller than the corresponding value of the flat-type pion distribution\namplitudes.\nSome final comments: It turns out that the nonperturbative content in the differential\nSR for \u03c6\u2032\u03c0 (0) is mainly due to the scalar-quark condensate, a feature valid also for the slope\nobtained with the integral SR. To be specific, the scalar-quark condensate term is proportional\nto the second inverse moment (12) of the distribution fS (\u03b1) of the vacuum-quark virtuality\nand is determined by the behavior of the quark condensate at large/moderate distances of the\nvacuum quarks. By virtue of (12), we may conclude that, adopting a model for the scalar-quark\ncondensate that has a slower decay at large distances, entails an increase of the nonperturbative\ncontribution to the SRs (17 and 19), so that also the value of the pion DA slope defined via the\nintegral and the standard derivatives increases.\nThe presented analysis shows that it is difficult to reconcile QCD sum rules, and related\ntechniques and features of the QCD nonperturbative vacuum in terms of nonlocal condensates,\nwith flat-type pion DAs.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Alexander Bakulev for stimulating discussions and useful remarks.\nA.V.P. is indebted to Prof. Maxim Polyakov for the warm hospitality extended to him at\nBochum University.
