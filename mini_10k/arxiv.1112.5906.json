We also explore a generalization in which there is unequal sharing of the costs of joining a community. Distributions change\nsmoothly from exponential to power-law as a function of a sharing-inequality quantity. This work\ngives an interpretation of power-law distributions in terms of shared costs.\nPACS numbers: 02.50.Cw, 89.70.Cf, 05.40.-a, 89.75.Da\n\nPower-law probability distributions are ubiquitous in\nnature, especially in social systems. For example, the\nfraction pk of U.S. cities with a population of k people scales as pk \u223c k \u22122.37 [1\u20133]. Other examples of\npower-law distributions include incomes [4], Internet\nlinks [5, 6], fluctuations in stock market prices [7\u20139], company sizes [10], numbers of citations received by scientific\npapers [11\u201313], and many others [3].\nExponential distributions, such as the Boltzmann distribution law, are also ubiquitous. But, whereas exponential distributions have a well-known basis in the\nprinciples of statistical physics [14\u201316], it is unclear if a\nsimilar principle underlies power-law distributions. Here,\nour interest is in how power-law distributions might arise\nfrom stochastic processes, particularly in social physics.\nOur approach is based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt). MaxEnt is widely used, not only in\nthermal physics, but also in image analysis [17\u201319], drawing inferences [20, 21], and in nonequilibrium statistical\nmechanics [22\u201324]. We show here that the same principle, with a 'cost-sharing' type of constraint, leads to\npower-law distributions.\nClustering can be framed in terms of 'joining\ncosts'. We focus on a problem of particle clustering,\nwhich provides a convenient language for comparing people joining cities to the statistical physics of growing colloids and polymers. We first describe a standard growth\nmechanism, which we express in terms of the 'joining\ncosts' of a particle to a growing cluster. One particle may\nstick to another, forming a cluster of size 2. Another particle may join the cluster, forming a size 3 cluster, and so\non. If there are N total particles, then the equilibrium\n\nof clusters of various sizes can be written as\n1+1\n1+2\n\n2\n3\n..\n.\n\n(1)\n\n1 + (N \u2212 1)\n\nN\n\nLet nk be the number of clusters of size k at equilibrium,\nnk = Knk\u22121 n1 = K k\u22121 n1 n2 * * * nk\u22121 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere K is an equilibrium binding constant. The probability distribution, pk , of cluster sizes is the ratio of the\nnumber of size k clusters to the total number of clusters\nof all sizes,\npk = Q\u22121 nk ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Q is the grand canonical partition function,\nQ=\n\nN\nX\n\nK k\u22121\n\nk\u22121\nY\n\nnj .\n\n(4)\n\nj=1\n\nk=1\n\nStatistical physics provides an alternative language for\nexpressing the logarithms of populations in terms of energies, free energies or chemical potentials, which are costlike additive quantities. Here, we define a dimensionless\nchemical-potential-like quantity, \u03bck , that we call the joining cost for a particle to join a size-k cluster,\n\u03bck \u2261 ln (Knk ) .\nRe-expressing Q in terms of these costs gives\nX Pk\u22121\nX\nQ=\ne\u2212 j=1 \u03bcj =\ne\u2212wk ,\nk\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nk\n\nwhere\n\u2217\n\ndill@laufercenter.org\n\nwk \u2261\n\nk\u22121\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03bcj\n\n(7)\n\n\f2\nis the dimensionless cost of assembling the whole cluster.\nIn this language, if wk is positive, the distribution will\nbe dominated by small clusters; if wk is negative, the\nsystem will preferentially populate large clusters. We use\nthis cost language for social physics below. To proceed\nfurther, we need to know how wk depends on k.\nIndependent particle clusters are exponentially\ndistributed. First, for illustration, we treat a standard\nproblem of colloid assembly or polymerization. Assume\nthe cost \u03bck for a particle to join a cluster is independent\nof k. Then\n\nEqual cost sharing leads to power-law distributions. Now, we consider a more general notion of a\nparticle's joining cost when it enters a k-mer cluster. A\nperson is more likely to join a larger city than a smaller\ncity because of greater opportunities of jobs, infrastructure, services, entertainment, and other economic and\nsocial factors. Existing citizens have already paid some\nof the cost of entry for the new joiner 'particle'. So, relative to the cost of joining an independent-particle cluster\n(\u03bc\u25e6 ), the cost \u03bck of joining a 'social-particle' cluster of\nsize k is reduced to\n\n\u03bck = \u03bc\u25e6 ,\n\n\u03bck = \u03bc\u25e6 \u2212 krk .\n\n(8)\n\n\u25e6\n\nwhere the constant \u03bc is the cost of adding one particle\nto a cluster of any size. A cluster of size k requires k \u2212\n1 particle additions, so the total cost of assembling the\ncluster is\nwk = \u03bc\u25e6 (k \u2212 1) ,\n\n(9)\n\nand the average cost of adding a particle, taken over all\ncluster sizes, is\nX\nhwi \u2261\nwk pk = \u03bc\u25e6 (hki \u2212 1) .\n(10)\n\n(17)\n\nEq. 17 expresses the idea of cost sharing, namely that the\ncost of joining a cluster is reduced because the existing\nk member particles provide a discount of rk each to the\njoiner particle.\nThere are two non-arbitrary limiting cases for how we\nmight choose the value of rk : (1) No sharing, rk = 0,\nand the particles are independent, as described above, or\n(2) Equal sharing, where each member pays the same\namount as the joiner when it enters the cluster,\nrk = \u03bck .\n\nk\n\nTo predict the probability distribution of cluster sizes,\nwe maximize the entropy,\nX\nS=\u2212\npk ln pk ,\n(11)\n\n(18)\n\nSubstituting Eq. 18 into 17 and solving for \u03bck yields\n\u03bck =\n\n\u03bc\u25e6\n,\n1+k\n\n(19)\n\nk\n\nsubject to two constraints: (1) a fixed known value of hwi\n(Eq. 10) and (2) normalization (ensuring the probabilities\nsum to 1),\nX\npk = 1.\n(12)\n\nwhich expresses how the costs diminish with cluster size\nin social-particle systems. The total cost to assemble a\nsocial cluster of k particles is\nwk = \u03bc\u25e6\n\nk\n\nj=1\n\nA constraint on hwi gives the extremum function\nX\nX\nhwi \u2212 S = \u03bc\u25e6\n(k \u2212 1)pk +\npk ln pk ,\nk\n\n(13)\n\nk\n\nso that the optimization condition is\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndp\u2217k ln p\u2217k + 1 + \u03b1 + \u03bc\u25e6 (k \u2212 1) = 0,\n\n(14)\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03bc\u25e6 are the Lagrange multipliers that enforce\nnormalization and constraint 10, respectively.

The exact forms, valid for all values of k, are given\nin the Appendix.\nOur term 'costs' here can alternatively be thought of in terms\nof 'economies of scale'. Making more widgets decreases the costper-widget. That is, if the cost of a widget factory is \u03bc\u25e6 , then\nthe cost per widget for the first widget is \u03bc\u25e6 and the cost per\nwidget for making two widgets is \u03bc\u25e6 /2. In this sense, the cost of\nthe second is 'shared' by the first.\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\npk\n\ngiving a power-law distribution. The scaling exponent\n\u03bc\u25e6 is the 'un-discounted cost' of adding one particle to a\ncluster.1\nThe present work shows how power-law distributions\ncan emerge naturally from random clustering of particles\nthat equally share the joining cost. The 'rich-get-richer'\naspect of power-law size distributions is that social particles are more attracted to bigger clusters than to smaller\nclusters. We have expressed this in a language of 'costs':\nthe power-law arises because member particles equally\nshare the joining costs with joiner particles. The powerlaw exponent is the 'un-reduced' cost \u03bc\u25e6 .2\nThe aim of the present work is not to build a model\nof a specific power-law process. We do not give here a\ngenerative way to derive \u03bc\u25e6 for any particular problem of\nsocial physics. Rather, the present treatment plays a role\nmore like the Boltzmann law, which is a framework for\nmodels, rather than a particular model itself. There is a\nlarge literature of models that generate power laws [25,\n26]. We believe that, at least in some cases, such models\nmay be interpretable in terms of shared costs.\nIn many situations involving people, the idea of cost\nsharing arises naturally. For example, a well-studied\npower-law distribution is of the number of citations to\nscientific papers [11\u201313]. Suppose the author of paper A\nis preparing to cite paper C. Every paper in the set {B}\nthat has already cited paper C can be thought of as a\nmember of a community that paper A is about to join.\nThe larger is the community {B}, the more likely it is\nfor paper A to join that community, and cite paper C.\nThe community {B} has already paid a higher cost by\nfinding paper C in sea of options that was larger at the\ntime. In this way, any paper B has lowered the cost for\nthe author of paper A to find and cite paper C.\nThe distribution of U.S. city sizes also has a powerlaw tail [1, 2]. It is more likely a person will choose to\nmove to Los Angeles, CA (population: 9 million) than\nto Fields, Oregon (population: 86). Similar to the cost\namortization obtained through an economy of scale, the\npeople of LA have already paid the development costs of\ncreating the companies, jobs, infrastructure, and services\nthat attract new individuals. Thus, the marginal cost of\nadding one more person is reduced, relative to the cost\nof adding a person to a smaller city.\nA generalized model for partial cost sharing.\nDescribed above are two limiting cases: no cost sharing\n(independent particles) or full cost sharing (the members\npay the same as the joiner). What if the member particles\n\ns = 0.9\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\ns = 0.5\n\u22124\n\n10\n\ns = 0.1\n\u22125\n\n10\n\n0\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\nk\nFIG. 1. Probability distributions for various sharing values,\nwith \u03bc\u25e6 = 2. At s = 0.1, the particles are barely helpful\nat all, and the entering particle must pay most of its joining\ncost, so the distribution is nearly exponential. At s = 0.9, the\nparticles are very helpful, and the distribution is a power-law.\n\nonly pay a fraction s of the cost that the joiner particle\npays?

Maximizing the entropy gives\np\u2217k\n\n\u0012\n\u223c\n\n1 1\nk+ \u2212\ns 2\n\n\u0013\u2212\u03bc\u25e6 /s\n.\n\n(28)\n\nWe call s the sharing parameter: s = 0 involves no\nsharing (i.e., independent particles) and s = 1 involves\nfull equal sharing between the joiner particle and all\nmembers. The s parameter controls the shape of the\ndistribution. For s = 0, the entry cost is the same for\nall clusters, and the distribution is exponential; there are\nvery few large clusters. For s = 1, the particles are social,\nand the entry cost is reduced for larger clusters, resulting\nin a power-law distribution; there are more large clusters\nin this case. Fig. 1 shows that varying s changes the distribution smoothly from exponential to power-law. We\nrefer to the limit s \u2192 \u221e as 'super-social particles': the\n\n\f4\nexisting members pay the full cost, and the joiner particle pays nothing. For super-social particles, we obtain a\nuniform distribution; all cluster sizes are equally probable.\nWe have shown how power-law distributions can arise\nnaturally from the maximization of entropy subject to\na symmetry relationship in which all particles share the\ncost incurred when a new particle joins a cluster. It has\nbeen noted before that MaxEnt with logarithmic constraints leads to power-law distributions [27, 28].3 Exponential distributions result from constraints on linear\naverages such as hki, while power-law distributions result\nfrom constraints on logarithmic averages such as hln ki.\nHere, we have described how such constraints can be interpreted as a type symmetry of sharing that is natural\nin the social realm.\nMany previous studies on generative mechanisms for\n\npower-laws have investigated a family of 'proportional\nattachment' (PA) rules [11, 30\u201332]. In the context of\nparticle clustering, a PA rule says that the probability\nof a cluster acquiring a new particle is proportional to\nthe number of particles it already contains. A premise\nof the PA rule is that the joining particle is cognizant of\nthe populations of the clusters in the system. By contrast, our cost-sharing framework does not assume the\nparticles know anything about the system, so the present\napproach may be useful for modeling systems composed\nof 'uninformed' particles.\nWe thank H.
