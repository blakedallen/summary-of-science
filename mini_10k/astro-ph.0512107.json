We have carried out a study of the orthogonal polarisation mode behaviour as a function of frequency of 18 pulsars,\n\nusing average pulsar data from the European Pulsar Network (EPN). Assuming that the radiation consists of two 100% polarised\ncompletely orthogonal superposed modes we separated these modes, resulting in average pulse profiles of each mode at multiple\nfrequencies for each pulsar.

In particular,\nwe found that pulse components that are dominated by one mode tend to increase in intensity with increasing frequency with\nrespect to the rest of the profile.\nKey words. pulsar \u2013 polarisation\n\n1. Introduction\nSingle pulse studies of the position angle (PA) of linearly polarised radiation from a number of pulsars show that it is built\nup of two modes of polarisation, which are separated in angle\nby 90 degrees (e.g., Manchester et al. 1975; Stinebring et al.\n1984; Rankin et al. 1988; Gil et al. 1991, 1992). It is believed\nthat these orthogonally polarised modes (OPM) reflect the\neigenmodes of the magneto-active plasma in the open magnetic field-lines above the pulsar polar cap. Three modes of\nwave propagation are allowed in this region, one of which is\nthe ordinary sub-luminous mode, which cannot escape the pulsar magnetosphere due to Landau damping and is thus of no\ninterest to the present work. The remaining two modes are the\nordinary super-luminous mode (O-mode) which is polarised in\nthe local plane defined by the external magnetic field and the\nwave-vector, and the extraordinary mode (X-mode), which is\npolarised perpendicular to this plane (Arons & Barnard 1986;\nPetrova 2001). According to Barnard & Arons (1986) refraction can separate the X- and O-modes beams, which have different indexes of refraction, by many beam-widths. The tendency for average profiles to have constant widths above a critical frequency is then explained by this separation occurring\nabove a critical height (Sieber et al. 1975). Two conditions are\nrequired for this: (1) the radio emission mechanism has to be\nSend offprint requests to: J.M. Smits e-mail: R.Smits@science.\nru.nl\n\nbroadband in frequency over a narrow range of heights above\nthe stellar surface and (2) the gradient in the plasma density\nhas a transverse component to the radial direction (McKinnon\n1997). The independent propagation of the two modes in the\nopen flux zone can produce the abrupt orthogonal transitions in\npolarisation position angle that are commonly observed in studies of individual pulse polarisation (Manchester et al. 1975).\nThe merging of the beams might also account for depolarisation of pulse average profiles with increasing radio frequency (McKinnon 1997; von Hoensbroech & Xilouris 1997).\nAlternatively, the OPM transitions might not be due to refraction, but due to switching between significant and insignificant\nconversion of O-mode into X-mode (Petrova 2001).\nOne of the most important questions about OPM is whether\nthe polarisation modes are disjoint or superposed. For disjoint\nmodes the polarisation of the observed radiation is given by either one of the two modes at each point in time. Superposed\nmodes occur simultaneously and the polarisation of the observed electromagnetic radiation is given by the vectorial addition of the Stokes parameters Q, U and V of both modes.\nCordes et al. (1978), who first posed this question based on the\npolarisation from PSR B2020+28, assumed the modes to be\ndisjoint and stated three arguments for this assumption: (1) the\ndegree of polarisation is fairly steady from one pulse to the\nnext, (2) if the modes are superposed, one might expect occasional sign changes in the complex value Q + iU when the\nlinear polarisation is low, due to random fluctuations in the rel-\n\n\f2\n\nJ.M. Smits et al.: Frequency dependence of orthogonal polarisation modes in pulsars\n\native strength of the two modes and (3) the instantaneous mode\nof polarisation seems correlated with the total intensity, which\nis consistent with disjoint occurrence of the modes. However,\nStinebring et al. (1984) found that the modes appear to be superposed by studying sensitive polarisation observations of a\nnumber of pulsars. It was found that average values of the\nfractional linear polarisation were small at longitudes where\nboth polarisation modes occurred with nearly equal frequency.\nThe same effect was later found in the instantaneous values of\nthe fractional linear polarisation in single pulse observations\nof PSR B2020+28 (McKinnon & Stinebring 1998). This phenomenon is present on timescales of hundreds of microseconds\nto hours, which is what one would expect for superposed OPM.\nFor disjoint modes one would expect the fractional polarisation\nto be either high or low, depending on the fractional polarisation of the active mode.\nAssuming that the polarisation modes are superposed, that\nthey are completely polarised and completely orthogonal, the\naverage intensity of the individual polarisation modes as a function of longitude can be determined from the Stokes parameters\nof the average pulsar signal (McKinnon & Stinebring 2000). In\nthis paper we make these assumptions and determine the individual polarisation profiles of 18 pulsars as a function of both\nlongitude and frequency (using data from the EPN database).\nIn section 2 we give a description of our analysis, the results\nof which are shown in section 3. In section 4 we discuss the\nresults and finally we give our conclusions in section 5.\n\n2. Method\nMcKinnon and Stinebring have developed a method to separate the modes of electromagnetic radiation that is built up\nout of two 100% polarised completely orthogonal modes that\nare superposed (McKinnon & Stinebring 2000). This method\nis illustrated by means of vectors in Fig. 1. Each pulse longitude will have a value for Stokes Q, U and V, which can be\nexpressed by a polarisation vector in Q-U-V-space (Poincar\u00e9\nspace). The intensity corresponds to the radius of the sphere.\nPolarisation vectors lying on the sphere indicate full polarisation, whereas vectors lying within the sphere indicate partial\npolarisation. The fraction of polarisation is given by the length\nof the polarisation vector divided by the radius of the sphere\n(the intensity). Furthermore, two vectors with orthogonal polarisation will be antiparallel. The method first fixes the orientation of the polarisation vectors to lie in the Q-V plane, shown\nin Fig. 1, by rotating the vector around the V axis. In this figure,\nthe average intensity of the observed radiation is given by the\ncircle with radius Ie , the observed polarisation vector is given\nby Pe and the underlying polarisation of the orthogonal modes\nare given by P1 and P2 . There are now two relationships between the observed intensity and polarisation vector (Ie and\nPe ) and the polarisation vectors of the orthogonal modes (P1\nand P2 ). First, Ie is equal to the sum of the lengths of P1 and P2\nand second, Pe is equal to the vectorial sum of P1 and P2 . With\nthese relationships the two orthogonal polarisation vectors can\neasily be determined from the Stokes parameters.\nWe apply this method to 18 pulsars for which polarimetric\naverage pulse profiles are available in the EPN database. Given\n\nV\nIe\n\nP1\nPe\nQ\nP2\n\nFig. 1. Poincar\u00e9 circle that illustrates the method used to determine the intensity and polarisation of two orthogonally polarised modes from the observed radiation. P1 and P2 represent the antiparallel polarisation vectors of both modes. The\nradius of the circle, Ie , represents the total intensity of the radiation, which is equal to the sum of the lengths of vectors P1\nand P2 , because the polarisation modes are superposed incoherently. Pe represents the polarisation of the electromagnetic\nradiation which is equal to the vectorial sum of P1 and P2 . Note\nthat the polarisation vector of the observed radiation has been\nrotated around the V axis to lie in the Q-V plane.\nthe assumptions that the radiation is built out of two superposed\northogonal modes that are 100% polarised, the separation is\ncompletely correct. Because the superposition is linear, separation of the average polarisation profile at each longitude will\nresult in the means of the individual modes at that longitude.\nBecause of this, we do not see the polarimetric behavior of single pulses, nor any polarimetric behavior on small timescales.\nIf, for example, the separation from the average polarisation\nprofile at a fixed longitude would reveal both modes to be of\nequal strength, then one solution might be that at this longitude all single pulses are built out of the superposition of two\nmodes with equal strength. Yet it might also be the case that\nat this longitude one half of the single pulses would be built\nout of just one of the orthogonal modes and the rest of the single pulses would be built out of just the other mode. The data\nfrom the EPN database consists of time-averaged data at multiple frequencies. Of these pulsars, 11 are known from previous\nstudies to show OPM. It should be noted that this method gives\nseparated intensities corresponding to both modes at each longitude, but there is no direct knowledge as to determine which\nvalue belongs to which mode. We therefore have to be cautious\nwhen making a longitude plot of the intensity of both modes\nas there are always two possibilities when connecting intensity\npoints from one longitude to the next. Generally, it is safe to\n\n\fJ.M. Smits et al.: Frequency dependence of orthogonal polarisation modes in pulsars\n\nassign values with the highest intensity to one mode and values with the lowest intensity to the other. When these values\nlie very close to each other, the assignment of value to modes\nis made on the basis of visual inspection for changes in modal\ndominance as evidenced by sharp jumps of nearly 90\u25e6 in the\nPA. In some cases the intensity points are connected by finding\na smooth line through the values. We have defined the polarisation mode with the highest integrated intensity at the lowest\navailable frequency as the strongest mode. We thus produce the\nintensity of the separated\nmodes, as well as the PA and ellipticp\n1\n2\nity angle ( 2 atan(V/ Q + U 2 ) as a function of frequency.\nFurthermore, we have calculated the ratio of the longitudeaveraged intensity of both modes at each frequency. For pulsars with two pulse components this has been done for both\ncomponents separately and for both components added together. \u221a\nThe error on the average intensity was calculated as\n\u03c3I =\nN * \u03c3, where N is the number of bins of the profile and \u03c3 is the noise level, given by the standard deviation\nof the noise as estimated from data in the off-pulse region of\nthe profile. For 14 pulsars, the pulse profiles at all frequencies were aligned by visual comparison of the profiles with\nthe corresponding plots from Kuzmin et al. (1998). When a\nprofile at a particular frequency had no direct comparison,\nthe alignment was estimated from the frequency development\nfrom the plots from Kuzmin et al. (1998). Pulsars B0144+59,\nB1039\u221219, B1800\u221221 and B1944+17 were not listed in this\npaper and were aligned by comparing pulse components and\ncharacteristics in the polarisation from frequency to frequency.\nWe can therefore not guarantee that these pulsars are aligned\ncorrectly.\n\nL\n\n3\nLine of Sight\n\nL.F.

Schematics of two field lines from which radio waves of\ntwo different frequencies are observed. L is the line that connects the locations where the dipolar field lines are directed towards the observer. Due to radius-to-frequency mapping, low\nfrequency radio waves are emitted higher in the magnetosphere\nthan high frequency radio waves. As the image shows, the low\nfrequency radio waves that can be observed are emitted on\nfield lines that intersect the surface closer to the magnetic axis\nthan the field lines that emit the observed high frequency radio\nwaves.\n\n3. Results\nIf we assume that emission altitude is inversely related to the\nfrequency of emission (radius to frequency mapping) and that\nthe magnetic field-lines are dipolar shaped at the emission\nheight, observing at different frequencies has two implications:\n(1) radiation at high frequency arises lower in the pulsar magnetosphere than radiation at low frequency and (2) radiation observed at high frequency is emitted at field-lines that intersect\nthe surface further away from the magnetic axis than radiation\nobserved at the same pulsar phase at low frequency (see Fig. 2).\nWhen studying the average profiles at multiple frequencies, this\nshould be kept in mind.\nFigures 4 through 21 show the results of the mode separation at all frequencies for all pulsars. The left columns\nshow the average total intensity (solid line) and the average\nintensity of both modes (dotted and dashed lines), the middle columns show the PA of the average Stokes parameters\nand the right columns show the ellipticity angle at all frequencies. The PA and ellipticity angle at pulse longitudes where\nthe polarised intensity is less than twice the RMS noise are\nnot shown. Figures 22 through 24 show the frequency development of the ratio of the average intensities of both modes,\nplotted on a log-log scale, for all pulsars. The straight line\nthrough the points was determined by the least squares fitting\ntechnique. Whenever these points show little deviation from\nthe straight line fit, the related power law index is shown in\n\nTable 1. As there is no preferred mode, the values are always\ntaken to be positive. The point-style indicates the reference corresponding to the source of the data in the EPN, which is listed\nbelow Fig. 24. The polarisation of the 1.41 GHz data from\nvon Hoensbroech & Xilouris (1997) was frequently found to\ndiffer from other 1.41 GHz EPN data and from the development of the polarisation as a function of frequency. Thus these\ndata were not included in the analysis.\nLet us now consider each pulsar in detail. For some pulsars\nwe will refer to the classification by von Hoensbroech et al.\n(1998), who have classified a number of pulsars into four\ngroups, named after one of the pulsars in that group. The first\ngroup of pulsars is exemplified by type 0355+54, for which\none component is highly polarised, whereas the rest of the profile has little polarisation. The component that is highly polarised has a flatter spectral behaviour than the rest of the profile and therefore dominates at higher frequency. The second\ngroup consists of 0525+21-like pulsars, which, in the classification system from Rankin (1983), are all examples of conal\ndoubles. They have two moderately linearly polarised components, the PA follows the rotating vector model (RVM) of\nRadhakrishnan & Cooke (1969) nearly perfectly and there is\nusually a core-type bridge between the components. The third\ngroup consists of 1800\u221221-like pulsars, which are young, have\na very high spin down power, \u0116, a relatively flat radio spectrum\n\n\f4\n\nJ.M. Smits et al.: Frequency dependence of orthogonal polarisation modes in pulsars\n\nbehaviour, detectable X-ray emission and radio emission over a\nwide fraction of the pulse period. They're also nearly fully polarised, linearly and circularly and do not show the commonly\nobserved effect of depolarisation towards high frequencies. The\nfinal group consists of 0144+59-like pulsars, which show an\nunusual polarisation behaviour. Their degree of circular polarisation increases strongly with frequency.\n\nB0144+59\nPulsar B0144+59 defines the class of 0144+59-like pulsars,\nas described above. Figure 4 shows that at all frequencies except 4.85 GHz there is a mode-switch around \u22122\u25e6 , which is\nassociated with a jump in the PA. At 0.4 GHz the first component can be associated with one mode, whereas the second\nand third components seem to be associated with the other\nmode. Although the intensity fluctuations around 2\u25e6 , which\nsuggest a second and third component, are not significant and\nmight be just one component. The association of the modes\nwith components is also valid at higher frequencies, even when\nthe first component becomes weaker and almost disappears at\n4.85 GHz. At this frequency the remaining component is almost completely dominated by one mode. Also, the slope of the\nposition angle traverse increases. This pulsar shows an example of a component (left component) being dominated by a single mode and slowly disappearing with increasing frequency.\nIt would be interesting to see whether this trend continues towards even lower frequencies. Unfortunately, such data was not\nat our disposal. The frequency development of these modes is\nnicely fit by a power law.\n\nB0355+54\nPulsar B0355+54 defines the class of 0355+54-like pulsars, as\nmentioned above. Figure 5 shows that the leading component\nconsists of mainly one mode (the stronger mode) and the second component is dominated by the other mode. At all frequencies, except perhaps for 10.55 GHz, the PA jumps and the ellipticity angle switches sign at the same longitude where the\nmodes change dominance. At low frequency the dominance of\nthe weaker mode is only a few degrees in longitude, but becomes broader with increasing frequency. This mode can be\nassociated with the second component, but the stronger mode\nis present there as well. The first component rises in intensity at higher frequencies, relative to the intensity of the first\ncomponent, which contains only one mode. This behavior has\nalready been noted by von Hoensbroech et al. (1998). The PA\nsweep of the left component is straight and has a small slope,\nwhich slightly increases with increasing frequency. The right\ncomponent shows the 90\u25e6 jump, after which the sweep remains\nstraight for a few degrees (the number of degrees depending on\nfrequency) and then has a smaller jump, followed by a curved\nsweep. The second jump in the PA can be associated with a\nsecond change in dominance of the two modes. However, at\nhigh frequencies this is not clear. It is also not clear whether\nthe curve at the trailing edge of the PA is the natural PA sweep\nof one of the modes, or that the curve is the result of a (non-\n\northogonal) superposition of both modes. The frequency development of the modes is nicely fit by a power law, except for a\njump at 1.642 GHz.\n\nB0450+55\nPulsar B0450+55 falls into the same group of pulsars as\nB0355+54 (von Hoensbroech et al. 1998). Figure 6 shows that\nat a frequency of 0.910 GHz the PA jumps 90\u25e6 twice around\n0\u25e6 longitude, indicating a brief mode-change which is visible\nin the average profile of the modes. The first jump shows a\ngradual change. The ellipticity angle switches sign at the same\nlongitude in accordance with the mode-change. At lower frequencies the PA also jumps twice at the same longitudes, but\nthis does not show up in the average profile of the modes. These\njumps are less than 90\u25e6 and also show a gradual change. It is\ninteresting that at 0.404 GHz the first jump is upwards while at\n0.610 GHz the first jump is downwards, while the rest of the\nPA sweep is very alike. The first component of the average intensity is strongly dominated by one mode and the intensity of\nthis component increases with frequency relative to the second\ncomponent, in which both modes are present and nearly equally\nstrong. Because it is dominated by one mode, Fig. 22 does not\nshow the frequency development of the modes in the left component. For both the right component and the entire profile, the\nfrequency development of the modes do not seem to be fit by a\npower law.\n\nB0525+21\nPulsar B0525+21 defines the class of B0525+21-like pulsars,\nas described above. Figure 7 shows that both modes are active\nin both components. At high frequency, there is strong depolarisation in both components, which is represented by the weaker\nmode becoming stronger at higher frequency. The modes in\nboth components behave very similarly, although the ratio between integrated intensity of the stronger and weaker mode is\nhigher in the right component. The intensity of this component increases with frequency, relative to the left component.\nThe PA sweep at 4.85 GHz shows a 90\u25e6 phase jump, suggesting a mode-switch somewhere in the bridge between the two\ncomponents. However, the frequency development of the PA\nsweep clarifies that this jump is actually the result of the normal RVM. The ellipticity angle gives little information about\nmode-switching, because of the low circular polarisation. This\nleaves us with no indication of mode-switching in this pulsar.\nThe frequency development of the modes are nicely fit by a\npower law in both components.\n\nB0809+74\nThe polarisation of pulsar B0809+74 has been well studied in\nthe past. Recently, Rankin et al. (2004) has shown that the two\northogonal modes of polarisation are the primary reason for\na variation in the longitudinal separation between the drifting\nsubpulses of pulsar B0809+74. Furthermore, Edwards (2004)\nhas confirmed that the polarisation fluctuations are the result\n\n\fJ.M. Smits et al.: Frequency dependence of orthogonal polarisation modes in pulsars\n\nof two orthogonally polarised modes, although an apparantly\nrandomly polarised component needs to be superposed. The\npulsar has two components. The first component arises with\nincreasing frequency and becomes visible around 0.925 GHz\nand higher and is almost completely dominated by the stronger\nmode (see Fig. 8). In the second component both modes are\nalmost equally strong. At frequencies of 0.606 and 1.408 GHz,\nthe PA jumps by approximately 60\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 , respectively. This\ndoes not seem to be associated with a mode-change. There is\nno clear frequency development of the modes.\n\nB0823+26\nPulsar B0823+26 has only one component, in which both\nmodes are active (see Fig. 9). Both the profile and the relative\nintensity of the modes do not change very much over frequency.\nAround the middle of the profile there is a small jump in the PA\nsweep, which increases in size with increasing frequency. At\nthe same longitude as this jump the modes are almost of equal\nstrength. Also, the weaker mode becomes stronger with respect\nto the stronger mode at higher frequency. The frequency development of the modes are nicely fit by a power law.\n\nB0834+06\nPulsar B0834+06 consists of two components with a high\nbridge connecting them. From studies of individual-pulse polarisation observations it has been concluded that both modes\nare equally strong in the two components, but only one mode\ndominates across the bridge (Stinebring et al. 1984). However,\nFig. 10 shows that the difference in average intensity between\nthe modes is small across the bridge as well. The PA sweep\nat 0.408 GHz and 1.408 GHz are very similar, however, the\nPA sweep at 0.610 GHz has a drop in the center of the profile.\nExcept for one point with a large error, the frequency development of the modes can be fit by a power law. But since there\nare only four points in total, this is not very significant.\n\nB0919+06\nThe average profile of pulsar B0919+06 changes greatly over\nfrequency. At low frequency there seem to be two components\nvisible, as well as a slope at the leading edge. With increasing\nfrequency the two components merge into one and the slope\nbecomes smaller and even disappears at 4.85 GHz. The profile is dominated by one mode, with the exception of the slope\nand part of the left component, in which both modes are almost equally strong (see Fig. 11). The weaker mode moves\nto the right with respect to the stronger mode, at rising frequency. This results in the extra component at low frequency\n(0.408 GHz), associated with the weaker mode, to disappear\ntowards higher frequencies. There is no indication of modeswitching. The frequency development of the modes seem to\nbe fit well by a power law, with the exception of the datapoint\nat 4.85 GHz.\n\n5\n\nB0950+08\nPulsar B0950+08 is remarkably similar to pulsar B0919+06.\nThey both have one dominant component a weak second component at low frequencies and a slope at the leading edge.\nHowever, the polarisation modes of pulsar B0950+08 are almost equally strong over the entire frequency range and do not\nshow any drift (see Fig. 12). There is no evidence of a modeswitch in the average profile. The PA does rise and fall where\nthe modes have nearly equal power, but only by 70\u25e6 . The rise in\nthe PA becomes broader with increasing frequency and at 1.642\nand 4.850 GHz, the PA has changed significantly. At 1.642 GHz\nit is clear that the PA drops instead of rises and by a smaller\namount than at lower frequency. The ellipticity angle falls and\nrises at the same longitude at which the PA changes. This dip\nalso becomes broader towards higher frequency. There does not\nseem to be a clear frequency development of the modes.\n\nB1039\u221219\nPulsar B1039\u221219 is B0525+21-like. Figure 13 shows that both\nmodes are active in both components and that the PA does indeed follow the RVM. At higher frequency, the weaker mode\nbecomes stronger. At low frequency the PA sweep shows a typical RVM curve, but towards higher frequency the sweep starts\nwith a rise and then drops in a straight line. For the first components, the frequency development of the modes seems to be\nfit by a power law. For the second component the fit is not so\ngood, but the same trend is visible.\n\nB1133+16\nThis pulsar has two components. In the left component both\nmodes are almost equally strong (see Fig. 14). The right component is dominated by one mode at low frequencies, but the\nmodes become almost equally strong at higher frequencies.\nThis behavior is the opposite of what would be expected by\ncomparing the results on the polarisation of B1133+16 from\nBacker & Rankin (1980) (hereafter BR) with the results from\nStinebring et al. (1984) (hereafter SCRWB). It can be seen\nthere, that at low frequency the right component shows OPM\n(Fig. 9 in BR), which becomes less visible at higher frequency\n(Fig. 17 in SCRWB). However, OPM are expected to occur\nwhen both modes are about equal in strength which, according\nto our results, is at high frequency rather than at low frequency.\nThis could indicate that the method for separating the modes\nis not succesful in this case. However, we must keep in mind\nthat we are only showing average profiles. If the (refracted)\npath of one of the polarisation modes in the magnetoactive\nplasma can vary in time, then the strength of the polarisation\nmodes can briefly change, possibly making OPM visible in single pulse studies. At 1.408 GHz the PA jumps upward by 90\u25e6\nand jumps downward again one degree later, which results in\na mode-change, as can be seen in the plot of the average intensity of the modes. At 1.642 GHz this jump is still present,\nbut has become more gradual, is less than 90\u25e6 and does not result in a mode-change. At 1.71 and 4.85 GHz these jumps are\nalso present, but are first downward, then upward. At 4.85 GHz\n\n\f6\n\nJ.M. Smits et al.: Frequency dependence of orthogonal polarisation modes in pulsars\n\nthe average intensity profile of the modes show a brief modechange. The modes in the left component seems to have a clear\nfrequency development, whereas the modes in the right component do not.\n\nB1237+25\nPulsar B1237+25 is known for its profile \"mode-switching\"\n(which means that it has two different average profiles, called\n\"modes\", which are not to be confused with the orthogonal polarisation modes) (Bartel et al. 1982). By comparing the EPN\nprofiles of pulsar B1237+25 with those in (Bartel et al. 1982),\nwe conclude that the abnormal mode can only be faintly present\nin the average pulse profiles. There are many components in\nthis pulsar, which are all dominated by the stronger mode (see\nFig. 15). While the weak component at a longitude of -3\u25e6\ncan be associated almost completely with the stronger mode,\nthe weak component at a longitude of 1.\u25e6 5 can be associated\nwith the weaker mode. These associations are strongest at low\nfrequencies. At higher frequency, the weaker mode becomes\nstronger with respect to the stronger mode. According to BR,\nthis pulsar shows OPM in the two main components at a frequency of 0.430 GHz, which, as in the right component of pulsar B1133+16, is not consistent with the result of one dominant mode. At almost all frequencies, the position angle rises\nand falls along the bridge between the two dominant components. At this same longitude, there is a lot of circular polarisation. This discontinuity in the PA is not associated with OPM\n(Stinebring et al. 1984), but it does occur at a longitude where\nthe weaker mode becomes stronger with respect to the stronger\nmode. Both the frequency development of the intensity of the\nmodes in the left and right half of the profile follows a power\nlaw, but the modes in the right half have a very low power law\nindex.\n\nand clarifies that the stronger mode is dominant in both components. There is, however, a brief mode-switch in the bridge\nbetween the two main components at 1.408 GHz and another\none at the trailing tail of the second component. At frequencies below 4.85 GHz the peak of the weaker mode is separated\nby approximately 15\u25e6 (\u2248 5.6 ms) from the peak of the stronger\nmode. At a frequency of 4.85 GHz, the weaker mode has almost\ncompletely disappeared. There is no clear frequency development of the intensity of the modes, but it is clear that the weaker\nmode becomes weaker with increasing frequency.\n\nB1929+10\nThe profile of pulsar B1929+10 changes greatly over frequency, but at all frequencies there is only one dominant mode\n(see Fig. 18). There is OPM at the trailing part of the main\ncomponent (Stinebring et al. 1984), which coincides with the\nrise of the weaker component. At 4.85 GHz the position angle\nsuggests that there is a mode-switch in the leading edge of the\nprofile. Due to the low intensity it is difficult to confirm this\nwith the intensity plots. It is interesting that the weaker mode\nretains its shape and position, whereas the components of the\nstronger mode change greatly in shape and position. This is especially evident at 4.85 GHz where one might naively expect\nthe two components in the average intensity profile to lie at the\nsame longitude as the second and third components of the 1.71GHz profile, rather than to coincide with the first and second\ncomponents. However, using the alignment from Kuzmin et al.\n(1998) the weaker mode does not change in longitude over frequency, which suggests the alignment to be correct. There is no\nclear frequency development of the intensity of the modes, but\nit seems that the weaker mode becomes stronger with increasing frequency.\n\nB1944+17\nB1737\u221230\nPulsar B1737\u221230 has only one component and falls into the\nsame group of pulsars as B0144+59 (von Hoensbroech et al.\n1998). At a frequency of 1.408 GHz and higher, the component\nis almost completely dominated by one polarisation mode. At\nthe trailing edge of the component the amount of circular polarisation increases. This behaviour is intrinsic to the modes themselves, as there is mainly one mode active throughout the profiles. The frequency development of the intensity of the modes\nseem to follow a power law.\n\nB1800\u221221\nPulsar B1800\u221221 defines the class of 1800\u221221-like pulsars, as\ndescribed above. At low frequency this pulsar has up to 4 components, but at high frequency this pulsar has only two components, both dominated by the stronger mode (see Fig. 17).\nThe first component arises at a frequency of 1.408 GHz. At\n1.408, 1.56, 1.642 and 4.852 GHz there is a gap in the PA due\nto the low signal in the bridge between the two main components. The PA at 4.85 GHz shows the PA sweep over this bridge\n\nPulsar B1944+17 switches modes at the leading and trailing\nedge of the pulse at 0.610 and 1.408 GHz (see Fig. 19). Overall,\nthe weaker mode has different intensity at different frequencies.\nIt is roughly 1/4 of the dominant mode at frequencies of 0.410\nand 0.925 GHz and about 1/2 of the strength of the dominant\nmode at frequencies of 0.61, 1.408 and 4.85 GHz. However,\nthere is no clear frequency development of the intensity of the\nmodes.\n\nB2016+28\nThe profile of pulsar B2016+28 has two components, which\nbecome less distinct towards higher frequency (see also\n(Izvekova et al. 1993)). Fig. 20 shows that these components\ncan be associated with the two different modes. At low frequency, the weaker mode consists of two components and\nof only one component at higher frequency. The peak of the\nmodes move towards each other with increasing frequency and\nbecome of almost equal strength. At frequencies higher than\n1.408 GHz, the shapes of the two modes are almost similar. Due\nto this behavior, the left part of the profile is dominated by one\n\n\fJ.M. Smits et al.: Frequency dependence of orthogonal polarisation modes in pulsars\n\nB2020+28\nPulsar B2020+28 is known for its abrupt mode-change\n(Cordes et al. 1978; Stinebring et al. 1984; Arons & Barnard\n1986). This can be seen in the PA at all frequencies (see\nFig. 21). This pulsar also shows a large drift of the modes with\nrespect to each other. Fig 3 shows the difference in longitude\nbetween the peaks of the two modes as a function of frequency.\n(The large errors are because of the uncertainty in the position\nof the peak of each mode.) The line through the points is a fit of\nthe function a log( f ) + b of the points, where f is the frequency\nin GHz and a and b are fit parameters. The values of these fit\nparameters are a = 0.\u25e6 56 \u00b10.\u25e611 and b = 8.\u25e6 54 \u00b10.\u25e613. There does\nnot seem to be a frequency development of the intensity of the\nmodes.\n\n4. Discussion\nData from the EPN is very suitable to apply the modeseparation technique for superposed modes, as prescribed by\nMcKinnon & Stinebring (2000). This makes a frequency analysis of OPM possible. Applying this technique to EPN data has\nthree drawbacks (1) the pulse-profiles at different frequencies\nare not aligned, (2) the information on the observed pulsar flux\nis seldom available and (3) the data only show average profiles, which might not represent the behavior of single pulses.\nStill, the results described here, give a clear picture of how the\naverage properties of the two modes behave as a function of\nfrequency.\nIn Table 1 we summarise the results of the analysis of the\northogonally polarised modes of the 18 pulsars, as well as some\nof the known parameters. w50 and w10 are the pulse widths at\n50% and 10% of the peak flux, respectively, S 400 and S 1400 are\nthe flux densities at 0.4 and 1.4 GHz respectively and \u0116 is the\nspin-down luminosity, given by \u2212I\u03a9\u03a9\u0307, where I is the pulsar's\nmoment of inertia for which we take 1045 g cm2 and \u03a9 and \u03a9\u0307\nare the rotation frequency and the time derivative of the rotation frequency of the pulsar, respectively. Values for the period,\npulse widths and flux densities are from Taylor et al. (1993).\nType and \u03b1 and \u03b2 parameters are from Rankin (1993), except\nfor pulsars B0144+59 and B1800\u221221 for which we have determined the type ourselves from the polarisation characteristics.\nThe types are based on the classification system from Rankin\n\n3.5\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\ndifference in longitude (deg)\n\nmode at low frequencies while it is composed of two equally\nstrong modes at high frequency. This pulsar is known for\nits mode-changing (Stinebring et al. 1984; Arons & Barnard\n1986). This can be seen at a frequency of 0.408 GHz, where the\nmodes switch dominance. At the same longitude the PA jumps\nby approximately 90\u25e6 , however the PA at 1.408 GHz has a similar behavior and does not seem to be associated with a modechange. This suggests that the jump in the PA at 0.408 GHz and\n1.408 GHz are due to the RVM and respresent the PA sweep of\nthe dominant mode. Moreover, at 0.610 and 0.925 GHz the PA\njumps downwards and does not seem to be associated with a\nmode-change. It therefore remains unclear what the true PA\nsweep of this pulsar is. There does not seem to be a frequency\ndevelopment of the intensity of the modes.\n\n7\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nfrequency (GHz)\n\nFig. 3.

The dashed line is the\nbest straight line fit through the points.\n(1983) which assumes a core radiation zone, surrounded by a\nconal radiation zone. They have the following meaning. Sd is\na single component profile; the line of sight grazes the outer\ncone of the polar cap. D is a double component profile; the line\nof sight cuts through the outer cone twice, but misses the core\ncomponent. T is a triple component profile; the line of sight\ncuts through the outer cone twice as well as the core. St is a\nsingle component profile; in this case the outer cone is missing and the line of sight only cuts through the core. Finally\nthere are two types that, in this view, can only be explained by\ntwo conal radiation zones around the core component; they are\nM, which is a multiple component profile (containing usually 5\ncomponents) and Tc , which is a triple component profile, which\nconsist of three conal components.\nLet us now consider some of the observed phenomena.\n\nMode-changing\nIn almost half of the pulsars, there is a jump of 90\u25e6 in the PA,\nwhich can always be associated with a change in the dominance\nof the modes.

In the interpretation of the two orthogonal modes corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary modes (Barnard & Arons 1986; Petrova\n2001), mode-changing is likely to be a result of the spatial separation of these modes due to refraction. Figures 4 through 21\nshow that mode-changing can occur at any frequency. A comparison between our intensity profiles of the polarisarion modes\nof pulsars B1133+16 and B1237+25 with the results from a\nsingle pulse study (Backer & Rankin 1980) suggests that OPM\ncan become visible in single pulse studies even when there is\none dominant mode thoughout the average profile. Figures 4\nthrough 21 show that in many pulsars there is a great change\nin the average profile of the two polarisation modes over frequency, suggesting in contrast to common belief, that refraction\ncan take place at all heights of emission.\n\n0919+06\n\u2212\n\u221a\n0.198\n\u00b10.010\n\u221a\n\n0950+08\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\n1.27\nD\n30\n+3.4\n18\n25\n85\n4\n32.1\n1944+17\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\n0.43\nT\n48\n+4.8\n23\n55\n60\n4\n33.8\n2016+28\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\n0.56\nSd\n39\n+7.2\n25\n37\n320\n30\n31.5\n\n\u2212\n0.34\nT\n72\n+3.6\n37\n49\n110\n38\n33.3\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\n0.44\nTc\n19\n+6.1\n40\n102\n35\n10\n31.1\n\n0.25\nSd\n12\n+8.5\n42\n86\n400\n85\n32.7\n2020+28\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\nMode-drifting\nIn two cases, the longitudinal position of one of the modes relative to the other can be seen to change as a function of frequency (see Table 1). For pulsar B2020+28, the longitudinal\nseparation between the modes as a function of frequency is\nshown (see Fig. 3). Assuming radius to frequency mapping,\nthis drift of one of the modes can be interpreted as a change\nof refraction with emission altitude. For pulsar B0919+06 the\nmode drift is less pronounced and whereas the drifting mode\nof pulsar B2020+28 moves away from the center with increasing frequency, the drifting mode of pulsar B0919+06 moves towards the center with increasing frequency. The relative drift of\nthe two modes might be correlated to other observable features,\nwhich have to be common features of both pulsars. Table 1\nshows the common features of these two pulsars. They both\nhave a period close to 0.4 s, are of type T and have a similar\nspin-down luminosity (log\u0116) of 33.8 and 33.3 for B0919+06\nand B2020+18, respectively.\n\n\fJ.M. Smits et al.: Frequency dependence of orthogonal polarisation modes in pulsars\n\n9\n\nSpectral behavior of the ratio of the modes\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nBecause most data does not contain any information on the\nobserved pulsar flux, the spectral index of the modes could\nonly be determined relatively. Nonetheless, Figs. 22 through 24\nshow that in many cases there is a clear trend in the ratio of\nthe average intensity of the two modes. The suggested power\nlaws are listed in Table 1. These trends imply that the spectral\nindices of the two polarisation modes often differ from each\nother. Possible explanations are that the conversion of ordinary\nmodes into extraordinary modes is frequency dependent (or in\nthe case of radius to frequency mapping, height dependent),\nthe two modes are damped differently, or one of the modes is\nmoving out of the field of view.\n\nWe have determined the average pulse profiles of two polarisation modes for 18 pulsars at multiple frequencies, assuming that the modes are completely orthogonal and 100% polarised. We find many cases where each polarisation mode can\nbe wholly associated with one component in the average intensity and cases where a 90\u25e6 phase jump in the PA is associated with the two polarisation modes changing dominance.\nThis suggests that the two polarisation modes are successfully\ndetermined in these cases. In other cases where there is a (gradual) jump in the PA of less than 90\u25e6 it would appear that one\nof the assumptions enabling the determination of the modes is\nnot always valid. The spectra of the ratio of the integrated intensity of the polarisation modes show that in many cases there\nis a trend for one of the modes to become stronger with increasing frequency. This can be both the mode which we have\ndefined as strongest, as well as the weakest mode. We also find\nthat the average profiles of the modes often differ from each\nother at different frequencies. In particular, we find that when\na component is dominated by one mode at low frequency it\ntends to increase in intensity with increasing frequency with\nrespect to the rest of the profile. Furthermore, out of 18 pulsars there are 2 pulsars that clearly show one polarisation mode\nchanging its longitudinal position with frequency. From our results we cannot determine whether the longitudinal transitions\nof one polarisation mode into the other at a fixed frequency are\nthe result of the X- and O-modes beams being separated due\nto refraction (Barnard & Arons 1986), or due to switching between significant and insignificant conversion of O-mode into\nX-mode (Petrova 2001). Both explanations can also account for\nsome of the complex changes that occur in the average profiles\nof the polarisation modes over frequency, since plasma waves\nwith different frequency will traverse different paths through\nthe pulsar magnetosphere. In the model of Petrova (2001) complex changes in the average profile of the polarisation modes\nover frequency implies that there are differences between the\nplasma number densities in polarisation limiting regions corresponding to emission at different frequencies. Following the\ntechnique as described in Petrova (2003) and assuming radius\nto frequency mapping, calculation of the plasma density distributions from polarisation profiles at different frequencies will\nthen yield changes in the plasma density both as a function of\nlongitude as well as altitude.\n\nAssociation of modes with components\nAssuming that the different modes follow different paths in\nthe magnetosphere, each mode can be responsible for several\ncomponents in the total intensity profile. In many pulsars a\nmode can, at some frequencies, indeed be associated with one\nor more components of the average intensity (see Table 1).\nFigures 4 through 21 show that this can occur at any frequency.\nThis association of polarisation modes with components suggests that the method used to separate the two polarisation\nmodes is successful.\n\nJump in the PA\nIn several pulsars, such as B0950+08 (see Table 1), the PA\njumps (sometimes gradual) 60\u25e6 through 90\u25e6 , while at the same\nlongitudes the ellipticity angle does not change sign and the intensity plots of the two modes do not allow for a smooth change\nin dominance, suggesting that there is no mode-change. Yet this\nbehaviour does seem to be associated with mode-changing, because the ellipticity angle usually shows a similar (but smaller)\njump and the modes are of equal strength during such a jump. A\npartial (less than 90\u25e6 ) or gradual jump in the PA cannot be explained with two completely orthogonal modes, since the PA is\ncompletely determined by the strongest mode and can therefore\nonly jump by 90\u25e6 . In the view of the ordinary and extraordinary\nmodes being 100% polarised and responsible for all the polarising characteristics of pulsar emission, the partial or gradual\njump in the PA can be explained when the two polarisation\nmodes are not always completely orthogonal (Edwards 2004).\nAn assumption that the modes are not 100% polarised would\nnot explain these jumps.\n\nCorrelation with type\nIt is interesting that only one of the observed features, mode\ndrifting, is correlated with the pulsar's type. And even this one\ncase involves only two pulsars. Also, the many pulsars we find\ncontaining one component, dominated by one mode at low frequency, and increasing in intensity with increasing frequency,\nare of all types. This suggests that the mechanism behind the\nfrequency behavior of the polarisation of pulsars is similar in\nboth the core as in the (multiple) conal components.\n\nAcknowledgements.
