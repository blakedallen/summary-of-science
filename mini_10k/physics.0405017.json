INTRODUCTION\nStudying energy resonances associated with the scattering of a projectile by a target\nis essential for the understanding of both the structure of the target and the interaction of\nthe projectile-target system. Several techniques have been developed for the investigation\nof resonances and the analysis of scattering data in the search for their specific\nsignatures. The objective of most theoretical studies on resonances is to increase the\naccuracy of the values obtained and to improve the computational efficiency in locating\ntheir positions and widths [1]. Resonance energies are identified with the complex poles\nof the Green's function GA , Z ( E ) = ( H \u2212 E ) \u22121 in the E-plane for real A and Z, and are\nlocated in the lower half of the complex energy plane for systems with a self-adjoint\nHamiltonian, H. Resonance states are bound-like states that are unstable and decay with a\nrate that increases with the (negative) value of the imaginary part of the resonance\nenergy. Sharp or \"shallow\" resonances (those located below and close to the real energy\naxis in the complex E-plane) are more stable; they decay more slowly and are easier to\nobtain than broad or \"deep\" resonances that are located below, but far from, the real\nenergy axis. However, it should be noted that resonances are not necessarily confined\nonly to the continuum. Resonance states for certain potentials (e.g., V = V0 r 2 e\u2212 r ) may\nalso be found embedded between bound states, such that the real part of the resonance\nenergy becomes negative [2]. In such cases, however, these states are typically the most\nunstable, with the negative imaginary part of the energy of these resonances being the\nlargest. Most of the algebraic methods used for the study of resonances are performed\ndirectly in the complex energy plane, whereas most of the analytic investigations are\nperformed in the complex angular momentum plane. An example of the algebraic\napproach is the use of the R-matrix method of scattering [3], whereas the ReggeSommerfeld-Watson method [4] is an example of an analytic approach.\n\n1\n\n\fThe energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian (poles of the Green's function GA , Z ( E ) for\nreal A and Z) in the complex energy plane consists, generally, of three parts: (1) a\ndiscrete set of real points on the negative energy axis corresponding to the bound states,\n(2) the real positive energy line which corresponds to the continuum scattering states, and\n(3) another discrete set of points in the lower half of the complex energy plane\ncorresponding to the resonance states. Figure 1 shows such a structure, associated with\nthe potential V (r ) + Z r , where A = 0, Z = \u22121, and\n\nV (r ) = 5e\n\n(\n\n\u2212 r \u2212 72\n\n)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u2212 8e\u2212 r 5 .\n2\n\n(1.1)\n\nAn alternative approach was introduced recently for the study of resonances which\ncomplements the two methods mentioned above [5]. It is an algebraic method that was\ndeveloped in the complex charge plane (Z-plane), and is consequently best suited for\napplications of scattering processes involving charged particles. The scattering of neutral\nparticles is obviously a special case. Bound states spectrum and resonance energies in the\nE-plane are mapped onto a discrete set of poles of the resolvent operator (the Green's\nfunction G\u02c6 A , E ( Z ) ) on the real line of the complex Z-plane. These poles are located at\nintegral values of Z for scattering involving elementary particles, such that Z =\n0, \u00b11, \u00b12,.. . As we vary the (complex) energy, these poles move along trajectories in the\nZ-plane. One of the biggest advantages of this formulation is its close formal and\ncomputational affinity to Regge theory in the complex angular momentum plane [4,6]\nallowing for the use of all the analytic and numerical tools used in that theoretical\nscheme. In particular, the scattering matrix could be studied by the analysis of the poles\nand their trajectories in the complex Z-plane in much the same way as that involving the\nanalysis of Regge poles and Regge trajectories in the complex A \u2013plane.\nThe basic underlying principle in the various numerical methods used for the study\nof resonances is that the position of a resonance is stable against variation in all\ncomputational parameters. In this paper we use the same principle to generalize the\nalgebraic approach, developed in the complex Z-plane [5], to give a unified algebraic\ntreatment of resonances in the complex E\u2212, A \u2212, and Z\u2013planes. We employ the complex\nscaling (rotation) method [7] in the generalization of this approach. A brief presentation\ndetailing the implementation of this approach in the E-plane will be given in the\nfollowing section. A short description of the development of the same approach in the Zplane will be given in Section III. This is followed by an algebraic reformulation of the\nRegge poles and Regge trajectories in the complex A \u2013plane in Section IV. Examples of\nsimple potential scattering will be given to illustrate the utility and demonstrate the\naccuracy of the approach. The paper concludes with a short discussion.\nII. RESONANCE IN THE E\u2013PLANE\n\nDirect study of resonances is usually done in the complex energy plane. As\nmentioned above, resonance energies are the subset of the poles of the Green's function\nGA , Z ( E ) (for real A and Z), which are located in the lower half of the complex energy\nplane. One way to uncover these resonances, which are \"hidden\" below the real line in\nthe E-plane, is to use the complex scaling (a.k.a. complex rotation) method [7]. This\nmethod exposes the resonance poles and makes their study easier and manipulation\nsimpler. In this method, the radial coordinate gets transformed as r \u2192 rei\u03b8 , where \u03b8 is a\n2\n\n\freal angular parameter. The effect of this transformation on the pole structure of\nGA\u03b8, Z ( E ) \u2261 ( H \u03b8 \u2212 E )\n\n\u22121\n\nin the E-plane, where H \u03b8 is the complex-rotated full Hamiltonian,\n\nconsists of the following: (1) the discrete bound state spectrum that lies on the negative\nenergy axis remains unchanged; (2) the branch cut (the discontinuity) along the real\npositive energy axis rotates clockwise by the angle 2\u03b8 ; (3) resonances in the lower half\nof the complex energy plane located in the sector bound by the new rotated cut line and\nthe positive energy axis get exposed and become isolated. However, due to the finite size\nof the basis used in performing the calculation, the matrix representation of the\nHamiltonian is finite resulting in a discrete set of eigenvalues. Consequently, the rotated\ncut line gets replaced by a string of interleaved poles and zeros of the finite Green's\nfunction, which tries to mimic the cut structure. Nonetheless, the subset of these\neigenvalues that corresponds to the bound states and resonance spectra remain stable\nagainst variations in all computational parameters (including \u03b8, as long as these poles are\nfar enough from the cut \"line\"). The objects and tools of this approach that enable the\ncalculation of resonances and manipulation of their trajectories in the complex E-plane\nwill now be presented.\nIn the atomic units = = m = 1, the one-particle wave equation for a spherically\nsymmetric potential V(r) in the presence of the Coulomb field reads as follows:\n\uf8ee 1 d 2 A(A + 1) Z\n\uf8f9\n(2.1)\n+\n+ + V (r ) \u2212 E \uf8fa \u03c7 = 0 ,\n( H \u2212 E ) \u03c7 = \uf8ef\u2212\n2\n2\n2r\nr\n\uf8f0 2 dr\n\uf8fb\nwhere \u03c7 (r ) is the wavefunction which is parameterized by A , Z, E and the potential\n2\n\nparameters. The continuum could be discretized by taking \u03c7 as an element in an L space\nwith a complete basis set {\u03c6n } . The integration measure in this space is dr. We\nparameterize the basis by a length scale parameter \u03bb as\n\n{\u03c6n (\u03bb r )} .\n\nThe following\n\nrealization of the basis functions is compatible with the domain of the Hamiltonian and\nsatisfies the boundary conditions (at r = 0 and r \u2192 \u221e )\n\u03c6n (\u03bb r ) = \u03bb An x\u03b1 e\u2212 x 2 L\u03bdn ( x) ;\nn = 0,1,2,..\n(2.2)\nwhere x = \u03bb r , \u03b1 > 0 , \u03bd > \u22121 , L\u03bdn ( x) is the Laguerre polynomial of order n, and An is the\nnormalization constant \u0393(n + 1) \u0393(n + \u03bd + 1) . The matrix representation of the reference\nHamiltonian H 0 ( \u2261 H \u2212 V ) in this basis is written as\n\n\u03bb2\n( H 0 )nm = \u03c6n ( x) \u2212\n\nd 2 \u03bb 2 A(A + 1) \u03bb Z\n+\n+\n\u03c6m ( x ) .\n(2.3)\n2 dx 2 2\nx2\nx\nConsequently, performing a complex scaling or complex rotation r \u2192 rei\u03b8 on H 0 is\nequivalent to the parameter transformation \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb e \u2212i\u03b8 . In the manipulation of (2.3) we\nuse the differential equation, differential formulas, and the three-term recursion relation\nof the Laguerre polynomials [8]. As a result, we obtain the following elements of the\nmatrix representation of the reference Hamiltonian, with 2\u03b1 = \u03bd + 1 :\n2\n2\n( H 0 )nm = \u03bb8 2n + \u03bd + 1 + 8\u03bbZ \u03b4 n, m + \u03bb8 n(n + \u03bd )\u03b4 n, m +1\n,\n(2.4)\n2\n2\n+ \u03bb8 (n + 1)(n + \u03bd + 1)\u03b4 n , m \u22121 \u2212 \u03bb2 \uf8ee\uf8f0\u03bd 2 \u2212 (2A + 1) 2 \uf8f9\uf8fb ( x \u22121 )\nnm\n\n(\n\n)\n\nwhere the symmetric matrix ( x \u22121 )\n\nnm\n\n(\n\n= \u03bd1 An> An<\n\n)\n\nand n> ( n< ) is the larger (smaller) of\n\nn and m. To simplify this representation we take \u03bd = 2A + 1 , which results in a tridiagonal\n\n3\n\n\fmatrix representation for H 0 . The basis {\u03c6n } , on the other hand, is not orthogonal. Its\noverlap matrix,\n\u03c6n \u03c6m \u2261 \u03a9 nm = ( 2n + \u03bd + 1) \u03b4 n , m \u2212 n(n + \u03bd )\u03b4 n , m +1 \u2212 (n + 1)(n + \u03bd + 1)\u03b4 n , m \u22121 , (2.5)\nis tridiagonal. Now, the only remaining quantity that is needed to perform the calculation\nis the matrix elements of the potential V(r). This is obtained by evaluating the integral\n\u221e\n\nVnm = \u222b \u03c6n (\u03bb r )V (r )\u03c6m (\u03bb r )dr\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n= An Am \u222b x e Ln ( x) Lm ( x) [ xV ( x \u03bb ) ] dx\n\u03bd \u2212x \u03bd\n\n\u03bd\n\n.\n\n(2.6)\n\n0\n\nThe evaluation of such an integral is almost always done numerically. We use the Gauss\nquadrature approximation [9], which gives\nN \u22121\n\nVnm \u2245 \u2211 \u039b nk \u039b mk [ \u03bckV ( \u03bck \u03bb ) ]\n\n(2.7)\n\nk =0\n\nfor an adequately large integer N. \u03bc k and {\u039b nk }n = 0 are the respective N eigenvalues and\nN \u22121\n\neigenvectors of the N\u00d7N tridiagonal symmetric matrix, whose elements are\nJ n , n = 2n + \u03bd + 1 , J n , n +1 = \u2212 (n + 1)(n + \u03bd + 1) .\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe reference Hamiltonian H 0 in this representation could therefore be fully accounted\nfor, whereas the potential V is approximated by its representation in a subset of the basis,\nsuch that\n\uf8f1\uf8f4( H 0 )nm + Vnm ; n, m \u2264 N \u2212 1\n.\n(2.9)\nH nm \u2245 \uf8f2\n; n, m > N \u2212 1\n\uf8f4\uf8f3 ( H 0 )nm\nSuch a representation is the fundamental underlying structure of certain algebraic\nscattering methods, such as the R-matrix [3] and J-matrix [10] methods. Nevertheless, we\nwill confine our present implementation of the approach to the finite matrix\nN \u22121\nrepresentation (in the subspace {\u03c6n }n = 0 ) of the potential V and the reference Hamiltonian\nH 0 . Taking into account the full reference Hamiltonian should result in a substantial\nimprovement on the accuracy of the results. This is currently being pursued and will be\nreported in the near future.\nTo illustrate these findings, we consider the Hamiltonian with the potential\nV (r ) = 7.5r 2 e \u2212 r ,\n(2.10)\nwhich has been studied frequently in the literature [2,11-13]. Figure 2 shows snapshots\nfrom a video that shows how resonances become exposed as the cut \"line\" sweeps the\nlower half of the E-plane. These snapshots are for different values of Z and A , and are\ntaken when the angle \u03b8 of the complex rotation reaches 1.0 rad. We make no attempt to\ncalculate resonance energies in this case since the method of complex rotation in the\nenergy plane is well-known. However, initial estimates obtained by this method will be\nused as input for the next two methods to illustrate the extent of their accuracy and to\ndetermine the degree to which they improve on these values.\nIn the following two sections the above findings will be extended to the study and\nanalysis of resonances and their structure for the potential V (r ) + Z r in the complex Zplane and A -plane. The first case has been developed in detail [5] and will be\nsummarized in the following section.\n\n4\n\n\fIII. RESONANCE IN THE Z-PLANE\n\nThe system described by Eq. (2.1) could be studied by investigating an equivalent\nsystem obtained from Eq. (2.1) by multiplication with \u2212r and rewriting it as\nH\u02c6 \u2212 Z \u03c7\u02c6 = 0 , where\n\n(\n\n)\n\nr d 2 A(A + 1)\n(3.1)\nH\u02c6 =\n\u2212\n+ rE \u2212 rV (r ) \u2261 H\u02c6 0 + V\u02c6 ,\n2 dr 2\n2r\n2\nand V\u02c6 \u2261 \u2212 rV (r ) . \u03c7\u0302 is the new \"wavefunction\" which is now an element in an L space\nwhose integration measure is dr r . The following realization of the basis functions is\ncompatible with the domain of the operator \u0124 and satisfies the boundary conditions\n\u03c6n (\u03bb r ) = An x\u03b1 e \u2212 x 2 L\u03bdn ( x) .\n(3.2)\n\nThe choice 2\u03b1 = \u03bd + 1 makes the basis set {\u03c6n } orthonormal. The matrix representation\n\nof the \"reference Hamiltonian\" \u0124 0 in this basis is written as\nd2\n\u03bb E\n\u2212 A(A + 1) + x \u03c6m ( x) .\n(3.3)\n2\nnm\n2 dx\n2x \u03bb\nOnce again, performing a complex scaling (complex rotation) on \u0124 0 is equivalent to\n\n( )\nH\u02c6 0\n\n= \u03c6n ( x)\n\n\u03bb\n\nx\n\n\u03bb \u2192 \u03bb e \u2212i\u03b8 . Using the differential equation, differential formulas and recurrence relation\nof the Laguerre polynomials [8] results in the following elements of the matrix\nrepresentation of the reference operator:\nH\u02c6 0\n= \u03bb \u03bbE2 \u2212 18 (2n + \u03bd + 1)\u03b4 n , m \u2212 \u03bb \u03bbE2 + 18 n(n + \u03bd )\u03b4 n , m +1\nnm\n.\n(3.4)\n\u2212\u03bb \u03bbE2 + 18 (n + 1)(n + \u03bd + 1)\u03b4 n , m \u22121 + \u03bb8 \uf8ee\uf8f0\u03bd 2 \u2212 (2A + 1) 2 \uf8f9\uf8fb ( x \u22121 )\nnm\nTherefore, taking \u03bd = 2A + 1 simplifies the representation and results in a tridiagonal\nmatrix for \u0124 0 . On the other hand, the matrix elements of the \"potential\" term V\u02c6 defined\nin Eq. (3.1) are obtained by evaluating the integral\n\u221e\nV\u02c6nm = \u222b \u03c6n (\u03bb r ) [ \u2212 rV (r ) ]\u03c6m (\u03bb r ) dr\nr\n0\n.\n(3.5)\n\u221e\n= \u2212\u03bb1 An Am \u222b x\u03bd e \u2212 x L\u03bdn ( x) L\u03bdm ( x) [ xV ( x \u03bb ) ] dx\n\n( )\n\n(\n(\n\n)\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\n0\n\nEmploying the Gauss quadrature approximation [9] gives the following result:\nN \u22121\n\nV\u02c6nm \u2245 \u2212\u03bb1 \u2211 \u039b nk \u039b mk [ \u03bckV ( \u03bc k \u03bb ) ] ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nk =0\n\nfor some adequately large integer N. \u03bc k and {\u039b nk }n = 0 are as defined in the previous\nN \u22121\n\nsection.\n\n(\n\nThe equivalence of the system described by Eq. (2.1) to that described by\n\u02c6\nH \u2212 Z \u03c7\u02c6 = 0 is only an approximation that improves with an increase in the size of the\n\n)\n\nbasis, N. The complex eigenvalues {Z n }n = 0 of the finite complex-rotated \"Hamiltonian\"\nN \u22121\n\n(\n\n\u0124 \u03b8 are the poles of the finite Green's function G\u02c6 A\u03b8, E ( Z ) = H\u02c6 0\u03b8 + V\u02c6 \u03b8 \u2212 Z\n\n)\n\n\u22121\n\n. The subset of\n\nthese poles that are stable (in the complex Z-plane) against variation in the parameters \u03bb\nand \u03b8 are those that are physically significant. The branch cut of the Green's function\n5\n\n\fG\u02c6 A , E ( Z ) is located on the negative Z-axis. Complex scaling rotates this cut line clockwise\nthrough the angle \u03b8 and exposes the relevant poles. This behavior may be understood by\ncomparing it with the corresponding behavior in the complex energy plane, and noting\nthat (i) the relative sign of Z to that of E in the Hamiltonian (2.1) is negative, and (ii) the\nlength dimensions of E and Z are the same as that of \u03bb 2 and \u03bb, respectively. Figure 3 is a\nsnapshot from a video that shows how the poles structure of G\u02c6 A , E ( Z ) associated with the\npotential 7.5r 2 e \u2212 r for A = 0 and E = 5.0 a.u. is revealed as the complex rotation angle \u03b8\nsweeps the upper half of the complex charge plane. Two strings of poles are clearly\nexposed while a third just starting to appear. The snapshot is taken at \u03b8 = 1.0 rad. As we\nvary the energy, which is generally complex, these poles move along trajectories in the\ncomplex Z-plane. The points where the stable trajectories cross the real Z-axis\ncorrespond to resonances. The relevant crossings involving the scattering of elementary\nparticles are those at Z = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12,.. . Therefore, one simple and direct strategy to search\nfor resonances in the complex Z-plane is to calculate the poles of the Green's function\nG\u02c6 A , E ( Z ) for a given real A and complex E. Subsequently, E is varied until one or more of\nthe trajectories cross the real Z-axis at integral values. In practice, one starts with an\ninitial estimate for the energy value of a resonance obtained by an approximate method.\nOne then zooms in at the crossings to refine the search. A numerical algorithm using\nbisection or Newton-Raphson routines [14] could be developed to automate the search.\nTo illustrate the utility and demonstrate the accuracy of this approach, we use it in\nthe calculation of the energy spectrum (including bound states and resonances) of the\nHamiltonian with the potential (1.1). Table I lists some values for resonance energies and\nbound states obtained by this approach, in which we also compare these values with\nthose obtained by other studies. The size of the basis used in our calculation is N = 200.\nStability of this calculation is observed for a substantial variation in the parameters \u03bb and\n\u03b8. To provide a graphical illustration of our findings we consider the potential function in\n(2.10). Figure 4 shows the lowest p-wave trajectories for real energies; they start on the\nreal Z-axis for low energies and bend upwards as the energy increases. Bound states\ncorrespond to points on the trajectories that coincide with the real Z-axis, and for which\nthe energy is negative and Z is an integer. On the other hand, resonance information\ncould also be extracted from residues of the poles along these trajectories for which the\nenergy is positive and the real part of the pole is an integer. These properties are similar\nto those of the Regge trajectories in the complex angular momentum plane. The same\nillustration for s-wave trajectories is repeated in Figure 5, but now the energy has a nonvanishing imaginary part. It shows several crossings at, or near, Z = \u22128, \u22124, and 9,\nindicating resonances.\n\nIV. RESONANCE IN THE\n\nA -PLANE\n\nThe study of the analytic properties of the S-matrix in the complex angular\nmomentum plane is one of the most active areas of research in scattering theory,\nespecially in high energy physics. In these analytic studies, Regge poles and their\nresidues and trajectories are the main objects used in the investigation. In this section we\ngive an algebraic representation of Regge poles and Regge trajectories in the A \u2013plane\n\n6\n\n\fusing the same approach as used in the previous two sections. Multiplying Eq. (2.1) by\n\u22122r 2 gives the equivalent \"wave equation\" \uf8f0\uf8ee H\u0004 \u2212 A ( A + 1) \uf8fb\uf8f9 \u03c7\u0004 = 0 , where\n\nd2\nH\u0004 = r 2 2 + 2r 2 E \u2212 2rZ \u2212 2r 2V (r ) \u2261 H\u0004 0 + V\u0004 ,\n(4.1)\ndr\n2\nand V\u0004 \u2261 \u22122r 2V (r ) . \u03c7\u0004 is a square integrable \"wavefunction\" in the L space with an\n2\n\nintegration measure dr r 2 . The following is an element of the L basis that satisfies the\nboundary conditions (at r = 0 and r \u2192 \u221e )\n\u03c6n (\u03bb r ) = 1 An x\u03b1 e \u2212 x 2 L\u03bdn ( x) ,\n(4.2)\n\u03bb\n\nwhere x = \u03bb r , \u03b1 > 12 and \u03bd > \u22121 . The matrix representation of the reference operator H\u0004 0\nin this basis is written as\nd 2 2E\n2Z\n= \u03c6n ( x) x 2 2 + 2 x 2 \u2212\n(4.3)\nH\u0004 0\nx \u03c6m ( x) .\nnm\ndx\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nTherefore, performing the complex scaling r \u2192 rei\u03b8 is equivalent to the transformation\n\u03bb \u2192 \u03bb e \u2212i\u03b8 . Using the differential and recursive properties of the Laguerre polynomials\nand taking 2\u03b1 = \u03bd + 1 results in the following elements of the matrix representation of\nH\u0004 0 :\n\n( )\n\n( H\u0004 )\n\n0 nm\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n= \uf8ee(2n + \u03bd + 1) 2\u03bbE2 \u2212 14 \u2212 2\u03bbZ \uf8f9 \u03b4 n , m \u2212 2\u03bbE2 + 14\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n(\n\n2E\n\n\u2212 \u03bb2 +\n\n1\n4\n\n)\n\n(n + 1)(n + \u03bd\n\n)\n\n( )\nto ( x )\n\n2\n+ 1)\u03b4 n , m \u22121 + \u03bd 4\u22121 x \u22121\n\nThe basis overlap matrix \u03a9 nm = \u03c6n \u03c6m\n\nis equal\n\nn(n + \u03bd )\u03b4 n , m +1\nnm\n\n\u22121\n\nnm\n\n(\n\n.\n\n(4.4)\n\n)\n\n= \u03bd1 An> An< . The real\n\nparameter \u03bd must now be positive due to the square integrability constraint imposed by\n\u03b1 > 1 2 . We consequently obtain three basis parameters, \u03bb, \u03b8 and \u03bd. However, one could\nreduce the matrix representation of H\u0004 0 into a tridiagonal form by taking \u03bd = 1.\nNonetheless, there is no escape from the need to compute the basis overlap matrix\n( x \u22121 ) nm . It might be worthwhile noting that during calculations the indices n and m could\nbecome large enough to result in numerically divergent values for the gamma functions\nin the expression of the matrix elements ( x \u22121 ) nm . In that case one should use an\nalternative, but equivalent, expression that is more appropriate numerically. The\nfollowing is an example of such an expression:\nAn>\nAn<\n\n\u0393 ( n +1)\u0393 ( n +\u03bd +1)\n\n= \u0393( n> +1)\u0393( n< +\u03bd +1) = \u03b4 nm + (1 \u2212 \u03b4 nm )\n<\n>\n\n\u2211\n\nn>\nk = n< +1\n\n(1 + \u03bdk )\n\n\u22121\n\n,\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere n> ( n< ) is the larger (smaller) of n and m. The matrix elements of V\u0004 , which is\ndefined in Eq. (4.1), is obtained by evaluating the integral\n\u221e\nV\u0004nm = \u222b \u03c6n (\u03bb r ) \uf8ee\uf8f0 \u22122r 2V (r ) \uf8f9\uf8fb \u03c6m (\u03bb r ) dr\nr2\n0\n.\n(4.6)\n\u221e\n\u03bd \u2212x \u03bd\n\u03bd\n2\n= \u2212 \u03bb 2 An Am \u222b x e Ln ( x) Lm ( x) [ xV ( x \u03bb ) ] dx\n0\n\nThe Gauss quadrature approximation gives the following result:\nN \u22121\n\nV\u0004nm \u2245 \u2212\u03bb22 \u2211 \u039b nk \u039b mk [ \u03bckV ( \u03bck \u03bb ) ] ,\n\n(4.7)\n\nk =0\n\nfor some large enough integer N. \u03bc k and {\u039b nk }n = 0 are as defined above.\nN \u22121\n\n7\n\n\fApplying the complex scaling transformation ( \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb e \u2212i\u03b8 ) on the elements of the\nN \u22121\nfinite N\u00d7N symmetric matrix H\u0004 \u03b8 = H\u0004 0\u03b8 + V\u0004 \u03b8 gives a set of complex eigenvalues {A n }n = 0\n\u22121\nin the A \u2013plane. These are the poles of the resolvent operator G\u0004 E\u03b8 , Z (A) = \uf8ee\uf8f0 H\u0004 \u03b8 \u2212 A(A + 1) \uf8f9\uf8fb .\n\nThis operator has a discontinuity along the vertical axis A = \u2212 1 2 in the upper half of the\ncomplex A \u2013plane. However, this discontinuity does not rotate under the action of\ncomplex scaling, in contrast to results obtained from the E- and Z-planes. Variations in\nthe values of the computational parameters \u03bd, \u03bb and \u03b8 produce changes in the location of\nmost of these poles. However, those poles that are stable against these variations (around\na plateau) are the ones that are physically significant. In fact, for real values of Z these\npoles are points on the Regge trajectories in the complex A \u2013plane. As we vary the\nenergy, these points move along their respective trajectories. Figure 6 shows the lowest\nRegge trajectories associated with the potential (1.1) for real energies while Z = \u22121. They\nstart on the real A -axis for low energies and bend upwards as the energy increases.\nBound states correspond to points on the trajectories that coincide with the real A -axis\nfor which the energy is negative and A = 0,1,2,.. . The same (with Z = 0) is repeated as\nFigure 7 but for complex values of energy. It shows one of the trajectories crossing the\nreal line at A = 3, indicating resonance.\nV. DISCUSSION\n\nThe reference Hamiltonian H 0 which we have considered in this paper involves\nthe Coulomb potential Z r . However, the algebraic approach for the study of resonances\npresented here could easily be extended to other reference potentials. In fact, all\npotentials that belong to the class of exactly solvable problems are compatible with this\napproach. In particular, shape invariant potentials [15] constitute such a class. This class\nincludes the Oscillator, Coulomb, Morse, Scarf, P\u00f6schl-Teller, amongst others. It might\nalso be possible that conditionally exactly and quasi-exactly solvable potentials are\ncompatible with this algebraic approach. We consider briefly the Morse potential to\nillustrate these possibilities.\nThe time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a one-dimensional system under\nthe influence of the potential V(x) in the presence of the background Morse potential is\nrepresented as follows:\n\uf8ee 1 d 2 B 2 \u22122\u03c9 x\n\uf8f9\n(5.1)\ne\n+\n\u2212 B ( A + \u03c9 2 ) e \u2212\u03c9 x + V ( x ) \u2212 E \uf8fa \u03c7 = 0 ,\n( H \u2212 E ) \u03c7 = \uf8ef\u2212\n2\n2\n\uf8f0 2 dx\n\uf8fb\nwhere x \u2208 [ \u2212\u221e, +\u221e ] and \u03c9 is a measure of the range of the Morse potential. The\n\nparameters B and \u03c9 are real and positive. This equation could be rewritten in terms of the\ndimensionless coordinate z \u2261 2\u03c9B e \u2212\u03c9 x as\n\n\u03c92 \uf8ee\n\n2\nd z2\n2\n2 \uf8f9\n2 d\n(5.2)\nz\nz\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ \u2212 ( \u03b3 + 1 2 ) z + 2 V ( \u03c91 ln \u03c92 Bz ) \u2212 2 E \uf8fa \u03c7 = 0 ,\n\uf8ef\n2\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 \uf8fb\n2 \uf8f0\ndz\ndz 4\nwhere z \u2208 [ 0, +\u221e ] and \u03b3 = A \u03c9 . Multiplying this equation by 2 \u03c9 2 z , it may be written\n\nas \uf8ee\uf8f0 H \u2212 ( \u03b3 + 1 2 ) \uf8f9\uf8fb \u03c7 = 0 , where\n\n8\n\n\fd 2 d z 2E\n2\n\u2212 + \u2212 2 + 2 V ( \u03c91 ln \u03c92 Bz ) \u2261 H 0 + V ,\n(5.3)\n2\ndz\ndz 4 \u03c9 z \u03c9 z\nand V = \u03c922 z V ( \u03c91 ln \u03c92 Bz ) . \u03c7 is the new \"wavefunction\" which is an element in a square\nH = \u2212z\n\nintegrable space with a measure dz and basis functions\n\u03c6n (\u03bb z ) = \u03bb An y\u03b1 e\u2212 y 2 L\u03bdn ( y ) ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere y = \u03bb z and \u03bb is a dimensionless basis parameter. Complex scaling in this problem\nis the transformation z \u2192 zei\u03b8 , which is equivalent to \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb e \u2212i\u03b8 as seen by writing H in\nterms of the coordinate y. One can easily show that the matrix representation of the\n\"reference Hamiltonian\" H 0 in this basis is as follows:\n\n(H )\n\n0 nm\n\n( )\n+ \u03bb4 (1 \u2212 \u03bb1 )\n2\n\nwhere\n\n(y )\n\n(\n\n= \u03bb4 1 + \u03bb12 (2n + \u03bd + 1)\u03b4 n , m + \u03bb4 1 \u2212 \u03bb12\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nnm\n\n(\n\n)\n\nn(n + \u03bd )\u03b4 n , m +1\n\n(\n\n(n + 1)(n + \u03bd + 1)\u03b4 n , m \u22121 \u2212 \u03bb4 8\u03c9E2 + \u03bd 2\n\n= \u03bd An> An<\n\n)( y )\n\n,\n\n\u22121\n\n(5.5)\n\nnm\n\n) and we took 2\u03b1 = \u03bd > 0 , making the basis {\u03c6 } in (5.4) an\nn\n\northonormal set.

The\ncomputational parameters in this case are \u03bb, \u03b8 and \u03bd. Consequently, the scattering\nproblem could also be analyzed in this complex plane using the same algebraic approach\ndeveloped in the previous sections.\n\n9\n\n\fREFERENCES:\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n\n[8]\n\n[9]\n[10]\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\nThe volume of publications on this topic is overwhelming.

(1.1). Our results are compared with those found\nin the cited references. Stability of our calculation is based on a substantial range of\nvariation in \u03bb (~ 15 to 60 a.u.) and \u03b8 (up to 0.5 radians). The accuracy is relative to a\nbasis dimension of N = 200.\n\nFIGURE CAPTIONS:\nFig. 1: The poles (dots) and discontinuity (line) of the s-wave Green's function in the\ncomplex energy plane for the system whose potential is V (r ) + Z r , where V(r) is given\nby Eq. (1.1) and Z = \u22121. Two bound states and eight resonances (two being sharp) are\nshown.\nFig. 2: Snapshots from a video that reveals the resonance poles associated with the\npotential 7.5r 2 e \u2212 r + Z r for different values of Z and A . The shots are taken at \u03b8 = 1.0\nrad.\nFig. 3: A snapshot (at \u03b8 = 1.0 rad.) from a video in the complex Z-plane that reveals the\nstable pole structure associated with the potential 7.5r 2 e \u2212 r + Z r for A = 0 and E = 5.0\na.u. Two strings of poles are clearly exposed while a third just starting to appear.\nFig. 4: A snapshot (at E = 10.0 a.u.) from a video of the p-wave trajectories in the\ncomplex Z-plane associated with the potential 7.5r 2 e \u2212 r + Z r for real energies.\nFig. 5: A snapshot (at E = 10.0 \u2212i 3.0 a.u.) from a video of the s-wave trajectories in the\ncomplex Z-plane associated with the potential 7.5r 2 e \u2212 r + Z r for complex energies. The\nimaginary part of the energy along these trajectories was fixed at \u22123.0 a.u.\nFig. 6: A snapshot (at E = 10.0 a.u.) from a video of the Regge trajectories in the\ncomplex A -plane associated with the potential V (r ) + Z r , where V(r) is given by Eq.\n(1.1) and Z = \u22121. The energy along these trajectories is real.\nFig. 7: A snapshot (at E = 12.0 \u2212i 2.0 a.u.) from a video of the Regge trajectories in the\ncomplex A -plane associated with the potential V (r ) + Z r , where V(r) is given by Eq.\n(1.1) and Z = 0. The imaginary part of the energy along these trajectories equals \u22122.0 a.u.\n\n11\n\n\fTable I\n\nZ\n\nA\n\nEr (a.u.)\n\n\u0393 (a.u.)\n\nReference\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22124.571182814\n\u22124.571182833\n\n0\n0\n\n[13]\nthis work\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22120.884280776\n\u22120.884280804\n\n0\n0\n\n[13]\nthis work\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2.25237\n2.252380731\n2.252380698\n\n0.0001196\n0.000118256\n0.000118256\n\n[12]\n[13]\nthis work\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4.50\n4.500948186\n4.500948155\n\n0.28\n0.247950731\n0.247950724\n\n[12]\n[13]\nthis work\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6.008281406\n6.008281376\n\n2.516116297\n2.516116273\n\n[13]\nthis work\n\n0\n\n0\n\n12.265190122\n12.265190099\n\n22.564268707\n22.564268653\n\n[13]\nthis work\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u22122.619884138\n\u22122.619884163\n\n0\n0\n\n[13]\nthis work\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.807634844\n0.807634812\n\n0.000000110\n0.000000110\n\n[13]\nthis work\n\n0\n\n1\n\n11.540707589\n11.540707567\n\n19.322893683\n19.322893627\n\n[13]\nthis work\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n\n\u22126.350068206\n\u22122.174721739\n1.247137679\n\u22123.696307827\n2.889663069\n4.800727358\n\u22121.585990038\n1.692732086\n4.147171558\n\n0\n0\n0.000004797\n0\n0.002920649\n0.710114512\n0\n0.000013522\n0.114113290\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\nthis work\n\n+1\n\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n\n\u22123.123360079\n0.272858107\n3.166536960\n\u22121.621483650\n1.638545711\n4.214321794\n3.046808400\n5.149962950\n6.641513385\n\n0\n0.0000000011\n0.001471786\n0\n0.000001942\n0.043509607\n0.000200882\n0.182528096\n1.415441677\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\nthis work\n\n12\n\n\fFig. 1\n\nFig. 3\n\nFig. 4\n\n13\n\n\fFig. 5\n\nFig. 6\n\nFig. 7\n\n14\n\n\fFig. 2\n\n15\n\n\f"}
