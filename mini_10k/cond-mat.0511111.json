Introduction\nSoft glassy materials, such as dense colloidal suspensions and super-cooled liquids,\nexhibit diverse rheological phenomena [1, 2]. Typical examples are the decrease of the\nviscosity with increasing the shear rate, called shear thinning, and the increase of the\nviscosity with the shear rate, called shear thickening. These phenomena appear when\nthe shear rate is beyond the Newtonian regime, that is, the regime in which the shear\nstress \u03c3xy depends linearly on the shear rate \u03b3, and hence the viscosity, \u03b7 = \u03c3xy /\u03b3, is\nindependent of the shear rate. Interestingly, the Newtonian regime becomes narrower\nas the temperature decreases and the density increases, and eventually it disappears. In\nthe case that there exists no Newtonian regime, the stress is finite in the limit \u03b3 \u0581 0.\nThis stress is called the dynamic yield stress. We seek to understand these rheological\nproperties systematically on the basis of a microscopic description of the system.\nRecently, the nonlinear rheology of soft glassy materials has been studied\nextensively through use of molecular dynamics simulations [3, 4, 5], analysis of random\nspin models [6, 7], and mode coupling theory applied to systems under shear [8, 9, 10].\nIn particular, the mode coupling theory have predicted that the dynamic yield stress\nappears discontinuously at the glass transition point [8] and the results have been\ncompared with a numerical simulation [11] and an experiment [12]. On the other hand,\nthe power law \u03b7 \u223c \u03b3 \u22122/3 has been observed for a shear thinning fluids [5, 6].\nAmong theoretical approaches, one standard method for microscopic study of\nnonlinear rheology is based on the mode coupling theory. In this theory, the singular\nbehavior of the viscosity is described by the anomalous part of the time correlation\nfunction, using a generalized Green-Kubo formula [13]. As another approach describing\nthe singular behavior, one could focus on the shear stress. Here, let us recall that the\nshear stress \u03c3xy is defined as the average of the y component of the inter-particle force\nacting on a plane transverse to the x direction. When there exist only two-body forces\namong the particles, this average can be expressed in terms of the pair distribution\nfunction. Therefore, in this case, the rheological properties mentioned above can be\naccounted for through an analysis of the pair distribution function.\nEmploying an approach of the latter type, in the present Letter, we first investigate\nthe linear stability of the equilibrium pair distribution function. We find that this\nfunction is unstable in the regime of low temperature and high density. Next, applying\na bifurcation analysis to a system near a critical state at which the stability changes, we\nderive an order parameter equation that describes the appearance of a dynamic yield\nstress in a simple manner.\n2. Model\nWe consider a system consisting of N spherical colloidal particles suspended in a solvent\nunder shear flow described by v(r) = (\u03b3y, 0, 0). We denote the volume of the system\nby V and the temperature by T . Let \u0393 = (r1 , * * * , rN ) represent the particle positions.\n\n\f3\n\nAn order parameter equation for the dynamic yield stress\n\nThe time dependent distribution function for \u0393, \u03a8N (\u0393, t), satisfies the Smoluchowski\nequation [1]\nN\nT\n1\n\u2202\u03a8N (\u0393, t) X\n\u2207i *\n=\n\u2207i \u2212 Fi (\u0393) \u2212 v(ri ) \u03a8N (\u0393, t).\n\u2202t\nR\nR\ni=1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\nHere, the Boltzmann constant is set to unity, R is the friction coefficient, and Fi (\u0393) is\nP\nthe interaction force defined by Fi (\u0393) = \u2212\u2207i j;j6=i V (|ri \u2212rj |).h In this work, we employ\ni\nthe Lennard-Jones potential, with the explicit form V (r) = 4\u01eb (r/\u03c3)\u221212 \u2212 (r/\u03c3)\u22126 . In\nthe treatment below, \u03c3, \u01eb and R are set to unity, and all quantities are converted to\ndimensionless forms.\nFrom the N particle distribution function \u03a8N (\u0393, t), the pair distribution function\ng(r, t) is defined as\ng(r, t) = V 2\n\nZ\n\nd3 r3 d3 r4 * * * d3 rN \u03a8N (\u0393, t),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere r \u2261 r1 \u2212 r2 . Using this function, we can express the time-dependent shear stress\nas [14]\n\u03c12\nxy dV (r)\n\u03c3xy (t) =\nd3 rrg(r, t) 2\n,\n(3)\n2\nr dr\nwhere \u03c1 \u2261 N/V is the average number density of the colloidal particles, r = (x, y, z),\nand r = |r|. Here, we have ignored the hydrodynamic contribution to the shear stress.\nIt is useful to expand g(r, t) in spherical harmonics, and we write\nZ\n\ng(r, t) = fI (r, t)ImY2,2 (\u03b8, \u03c6) + fR (r, t)ReY2,2 (\u03b8, \u03c6)\nX\n\n+\n\nGl,m (r, t)Yl,m(\u03b8, \u03c6),\n\n(4)\n\nl\u22650;|m|\u2264l;{l,m}6={2,\u00b12}\n\nemploying the spherical coordinate system (r, \u03b8, \u03c6). Hence, substituting equation (4)\ninto equation (3), we obtain\ns\n\n2\u03c0 2 \u221e\n\u2202V (r)\n\u03c1\nfI (r, t).\n(5)\ndrr 3\n\u03c3xy (t) =\n15\n\u2202r\n0\nThis expression clearly indicates that if there is singular behavior of the shear stress\n\u03c3xy , that of the pair distribution function can be observed. In particular, the existence\nof a dynamic yield stress implies that the pair distribution function in the limit \u03b3 \u0581 0\ndiffers from the equilibrium one. This observation naturally leads us to conjecture that\nthe dynamic yield stress is related to the instability of the equilibrium pair distribution\nfunction, geq (r). For this reason, we carry out a linear stability analysis of geq (r).\nIn order to determine the linear stability of geq (r), we need to study the time\nevolution of the pair distribution function. This is described by the BBGKY hierarchy,\nand hence it is determined by the three-particle distribution function g3 (r, r \u2032, t).\nIn order to obtain a self-contained description, we truncate the BBGKY hierarchy\nby employing the Kirkwood superposition approximation, assuming the relation\ng3 (r, r \u2032 , t) = g(r, t)g(r \u2032, t)g(r \u2212 r \u2032 , t) [15]. This approximation has been used in the\ncalculation of the pair distribution function for both an equilibrium system [16] and\nZ\n\n\f4\n\nAn order parameter equation for the dynamic yield stress\n\na non-equilibrium system under shear [17]. With this approximation, the evolution\nequation for the pair distribution function is derived as\n\u2202g(r, t)\n= \u2212\u2207 * J (r, t),\n\u2202t\n\n(6)\n\nwith\nJ (r, t) = \u2212 2T \u2207g(r, t) \u2212 2\u2207V (r)g(r, t)\n\u2212 2\u03c1\n+ \u03b3y\n\n\u0012Z\n\n3 \u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nd r \u2207V (r )g(r, t)g(r , t)g(r \u2212 r , t)\n\nd\ng(r, t).\ndx\n\n\u0013\n\n(7)\n\n3. Linear stability analysis\nFirst, the equilibrium pair distribution function geq (r) for this model is obtained as the\nisotropic solution of the equation J = 0 in equation (7) with \u03b3 = 0. This equation\nis called the Born-Green equation [15], which has been solved numerically [16]. Then,\nwriting\ng(r, t) = geq (r) (1 + h(r, t)) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwe substitute equation (8) into equations (6) and (7) and obtain the form\n\u2202\nh(r, t) = L(h(r, t)) + N (h(r, t)) + \u03b3G(h(r, t)),\n(9)\n\u2202t\nwhere L is a linear operator and N contains only second and third order polynomials\nin h(r, t).\nBecause the equilibrium pair distribution function geq (r) is non-negative, it is\nlinearly unstable if and only if the linear operator L has a positive eigenvalue. Therefore,\nin order to determine the linear stability of geq (r), we could numerically compute the\neigenvalues of L. However, due to the three-dimensional spatial dependence of h(r, t),\nthe computation of these eigenvalues is not simple. Therefore, to simplify the problem,\nwe assume perturbations h(r, t) of the form h(r, t) = \u03c8(r, t)ImY2,2 (\u03b8, \u03c6). Such an\nassumption is reasonable, because the equilibrium pair distribution function is expected\nto be unstable with respect to perturbations of the form ImY2,2 (\u03b8, \u03c6) in the regime\ncharacterized by low temperature and high density. (See equations (4) and (5)). Then,\nusing the explicit form of L, we can rewrite L(h(r, t)) in equation (9) as\ngeq (r)\n\nL(h(r, t)) = ImY2,2 (\u03b8, \u03c6)M(\u03c8(r, t)).\n\n(10)\n\nTo solve the linear stability problem, we seek the eigenvalues of M.\nThe eigenvalues of the operator M are computed numerically in the following way.\nWe first restrict the spatial domain of \u03c8(r, t) to the interval [0, l], with the boundary\nconditions \u2202\u03c8(r, t)/\u2202r = 0 at r = 0 and r = l. We next approximate the linear operator\nM as a matrix M by using a difference method with a spatial mesh size \u03b4x [18]. We\ncalculated the eigenvalues of M for many values of (\u03c1, T ).\n\n\f5\n\nAn order parameter equation for the dynamic yield stress\n\nIn figure 1, we display the stability diagram obtained numerically. It is seen that\nthe pair distribution function geq (r) is unstable in the low temperature, high density\nregime. Note that the form of the boundary between the two regimes is qualitatively\nsimilar to the curve representing the glass transition in the (\u03c1, T ) plane calculated using\nmode coupling theory [19], though at each density, the value of the temperature on\nthe boundary in the present case is approximately twice that in the glass transition\ncase. This overestimate of the temperature might be caused by the inaccuracy of the\nequilibrium pair distribution function geq (r) calculated with the Kirkwood superposition\napproximation. Indeed, it has been known that the maximum of geq (r) obtained by this\napproximation is less pronounced and is shifted towards smaller interparticle distances\nthan that obtained by Monte Carlo simulations.\n\n3\nT\n\n2\n1\n\n1.04\n\n\u03c1\n\n1.08\n\n1.12\n\nFigure 1.

This\nresult was obtained for the numerical values l = 7.0 and \u03b4x = 7.0/512.\n\n4. Non-linear analysis\nNext, we focus on systems near the critical state at which the stability changes. If we\nfix the density, then we find that there exists a critical temperature Ts below which\nthe equilibrium pair distribution function geq (r) is unstable. Let \u03c8\u2217 (r) be the critical\neigenfunction of the operator M at T = Ts . Then, we write a perturbation h(r, t) in\nthe form\nh(r, t) = A(t)\u03c8\u2217 (r)ImY2,2 (\u03b8, \u03c6) + s(r, A(t)).\n\n(11)\n\nHere, s(r, A(t)) represents the contribution to h(r, t) that is not from the critical mode,\nand we have assumed that its time dependence is restricted to that of the amplitude\nA. This is a reasonable assumption because the amplitudes of non-critical modes decay\nquickly to the values determined by A [20].\nThen, using a bifurcation analysis (See reference [21] as a review), from equations\n(9) and (11), we perturbatively obtain the evolution equation for A(t) in the form\nd\nA(t) = (Ts \u2212 T )aA(t) + G(A(t)) + \u03b3H(A(t)),\n(12)\ndt\n\n\fAn order parameter equation for the dynamic yield stress\n\n6\n\nwhere a is a positive constant, and the functions G(A) and H(A) can be calculated\nfrom equation (9) [22]. In this Letter, we do not calculate G(A) and H(A). Instead,\nconsidering the general forms of these functions, we qualitatively describe the singular\nbehavior of the shear stress.\nFirst, because the system possesses symmetry with respect to the simultaneous\ntransformation x \u2192 \u2212x and \u03b3 \u2192 \u2212\u03b3, G(A) must be odd function and H(A) an even\nfunction. We therefore expand as\nG(A) = b3 A3 + b5 A5 + * * * ,\n\n(13)\n\nH(A) = c0 + c2 A2 + * * * .\n\n(14)\n\nNext, let A\u2217 (\u03b3) be a stable stationary solution of equation (12). Then, from\nequations (5) and (11), the shear stress for systems near the critical state T = Ts\nand \u03b3 = 0 can be approximately expressed as\ns\n\n2\u03c0 2 \u221e\n\u2202U(r)\ndrr 3\n\u03c1\ngeq (r)\u03c8\u2217 (r),\n(15)\n\u03c3xy \u2243 A\u2217 (\u03b3)\n15\n\u2202r\n0\nbecause s(r, A(t)) in equation (11) contains no terms linear in A as we have confirmed.\nThus, the value of A\u2217 (\u03b3) determines the behavior of the shear stress near the critical\nstate. In this sense, the amplitude of the critical mode can be regarded as an order\nparameter describing the appearance of the dynamic yield stress.\nNow, we investigate equation (12). For \u03b3 = 0, this equation possesses the trivial\nstationary solution A\u2217 = 0. This solution is stable only when T > Ts . The non-trivial\nstationary solutions depend on the form of G(A). First, let us consider the case that\nb3 < 0 in equation (13). (We conjecture that b3 < 0 for the model we study.) Then, for\nT \u2243 Ts and \u03b3 \u2243 0, A\u2217 satisfies (Ts \u2212 T )aA\u2217 + b3 A3\u2217 \u2243 \u2212\u03b3c0 under the assumption that\nA\u2217 and \u03b3 are expressed as power-law functions of (T \u2212 Ts ). Thus, in the limit \u03b3 \u0581 0, the\nshear stress is obtained as a function of the temperature near T = Ts . The qualitative\nform of this function is displayed in the left side of figure 2. It is seen that the dynamic\nyield stress increases continuously from zero as T decreases from Ts . By contrast, when\nT = Ts and \u03b3 > 0, we obtain\n\u03c3xy \u2243 \u03b3 1/\u03b4 ,\n\nZ\n\n(16)\n\nwith \u03b4 = 3. This \u03b4 corresponds to that appearing in the relation M \u2243 H 1/\u03b4 describing\ncritical phenomena for magnetic materials, and the value \u03b4 = 3 is the mean field value\nfor the Ising model. Note that equation (16) yields \u03b7 \u2243 \u03b3 \u2212(1\u22121/\u03b4) . The exponent 1 \u2212 1/\u03b4\nis called the shear thinning exponent, and we find it to be 2/3 in this analysis. We\nalso find that when T > Ts , a Newtonian regime appears near \u03b3 = 0. This regime is\nconnected to the power law regime that exists for higher shear rates. As seen in the\ninset of the left side of figure 2, this behavior corresponds to shear thinning.\nNext, we consider the case b3 > 0 and find that here, a qualitatively different form of\nthe stress is obtained. (We expect that there do exist models in which b3 > 0, although\nwe believe that the model studied presently is not one of these.)

In this case, as the temperature is decreased, the dynamic yield stress increases\ndiscontinuously from zero to a finite value at some temperature Tc (> Ts ), as shown in\nthe right side of figure 2. Furthermore, it is easily confirmed that shear thickening exists\nwhen T > Tc .\n5. Conclusion\nThe main finding of this Letter is that the order parameter equation given in equation\n(12) provides a simple description of the nonlinear rheological phenomena exhibited by\nthe systems considered here. We note that the order parameter in our model is defined\nto be the amplitude of the critical mode of the pair distribution function, which is\nrelated to the equal time correlation function of the density. This contrasts with the\nsituation for the critical phenomena of liquid-gas phase transitions, for which the order\nparameter is defined in terms of the critical mode of the density. Consideration of this\ndifference might help elucidate the essence of the glass transition.\nWe conjecture that the coefficient b3 is negative for the model we study. This\nindicates that the dynamic yield stress appears continuously from 0 at the transition\npoint. This result is different from that obtained by the mode coupling theory that\npredicts the discontinuous appearance of the dynamic yield stress. Note that the recent\nresult in Ref. [11] might support the discontinuous onset, while the power-law behavior\nconsistent with our result is still observed in the range 10\u22124 < \u03b3 < 10\u22121 in this report.\nOur simple theory in the present version might miss some important physical effects.\nWe will study further in order to understand this discrepancy.\nFinally, we present remarks regarding the two assumptions we employed in our\nanalysis. First, the perturbations to geq (r) are assumed to be restricted to the form\nh(r, t) = \u03c8(r, t)ImY2,2 (\u03b8, \u03c6) for simplicity. Here, we note that we already performed\nthe analysis without this restriction and obtained the same stability diagram [22]. In\n\n\fAn order parameter equation for the dynamic yield stress\n\n8\n\nthis analysis, the five critical modes, which correspond to \u03c3xy , \u03c3yz , \u03c3zx , \u03c3xx \u2212 \u03c3yy , and\n\u03c3zz \u2212 (\u03c3xx + \u03c3yy )/2, appear simultaneously at T = Ts as the result of the rotational\nsymmetry. Then, five order parameters are defined in association with these critical\nmodes. We will report the result in another paper.\nSecond, with regard to the Kirkwood superposition approximation, we consider\nthat it has some analogy with a mean field theory for critical phenomena. Therefore,\nwe expect that the time evolution of the five order parameter fields (that depend on\nthe spatial coordinate) under the influence of noise can describe rheological phenomena\nmore precisely. This extension might modify the critical exponent \u03b4, and also it might\nplay an important role in the description of phenomena for the case T < Ts . We wish\nto develop such a theory as a natural extension of our analysis in this Letter.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports\nand Culture of Japan (No. 16540337).\nReferences\n[1] Russel W B, Saville D A and Schowalter W R, Colloidal Dispersions (New York: Cambridge\nUniversity Press).\n[2] Larson R G, 1999 The Structure and Rheology of Complex Fluids (New York: Oxford University\nPress).\n[3] Strating P, 1995 J.
