Fv\n*Contact address; nowik@vms.huji.ac.il\nIntroduction\nRecently two new families of high Tc superconducting materials have been discovered. One family\nhas the composition RAsFeO1-xFx where R stands for a rare earth and the fraction x can be\ncomposed also by vacancies. The other family is Sr1-xKxFe2As2 where Ba can substitute Sr. These\nsystems display in some cases superconductivity (SC) at temperatures (Tc) extending above 50 K.\nAll systems are derivatives of magnetic spin density wave (SDW) systems (for x=0). SC emerges\nwhen doping of a magnetic parent compound with holes (or electrons) is done, and thereby\nsuppressing the magnetic order. Some researchers report that they observe also magnetic order,\neven below Tc. Macroscopic measurements (like susceptibility or resistivity), or microscopic\nmeasurements, which sense averages of various localities (like \u03bcSR), are not able to determine the\npresence of foreign phases. Even XRD measurements are not sensitive enough to disclose small\namounts of foreign phases, in particular if they have XRD lines similar to those of the SC system.\nSince all these systems contain iron, and this is the only element, which can order magnetically at\nrelatively high temperatures, then a small amount of an iron compound, which orders\nmagnetically, can contribute to the illusion that the superconducting materials exhibit also\nmagnetic order. M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy of\n\n57\n\nFe of these materials can discover the presence of\n\nsuch compounds. The compounds, which are most probable to be present, are Fe2As (TN=353 K),\nFeAs (TM=77 K) and FeAs2 (TM< 5K) [1-3].\n\nExperimental details\nM\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy studies were performed using a conventional constant acceleration drive\nand a 50 mCi\n\n57\n\nCo:Rh source. The velocity calibration was done with a room temperature \u03b1-Fe\n1\n\n\fabsorber and the isomer shifts (I.S.) values are relative to that of iron. The observed spectra,\nmeasured at temperatures extending from 4.2 K to 300 K, were least square fitted by theoretical\nspectra including, in the necessary cases, the full diagonalization of the hyperfine interaction Spin\nHamiltonian, starting with hyperfine interaction parameters, corresponding to those of the assumed\nforeign phases [1-3]. The compounds CeAsFeO0.84F0.16, Sr0.9K0.1Fe2As2 and Sr0.6K0.4Fe2As2 were\nprepared and kindly supplied by Texas Center for Superconductivity at the University of Houston,\nU.S.A. The compounds SmAsFeO, SmAsFeO0.85 and SmAsFeO0.9F0.1 were prepared and kindly\nsupplied by Prof. Zhi-An Ren, National Laboratory for Superconductivity, Chinese Academy of\nSciences, Beijing, China and LaAsFeO0.9 was prepared and kindly supplied by NPL, New-Delhi,\nIndia [4].\nExperimental results and discussion\na)\n\nThe system LaAsFeO0.9\n\nLaAsFeO0.9 was prepared in evacuated quartz tubes in a single step procedure [5]. This system\nexhibits SDW magnetic order at 95 K, however at 200 K it displays well-defined absorption lines,\nFig. 1, corresponding to the pure LaAsFeO0.9 system (the major singlet) and an additional\nquadrupole doublet, which was erroneously claimed to correspond to iron nuclei which have a\nvacancy in their immediate environment [4]. However the hyperfine interaction parameters (I.S.=\n0.35 mm/s and quadrupole splitting QS=eqQ/2=1.88 mm/s) are identical to those of FeAs2 [1]. The\nrelative abundance of this foreign phase is 11\u00b11 %. The effect of a local nearest vacancy on the\nlocal electric field gradient is probably negligible.\n\nRELATIVE TRANSMISSION\n\n1.00\n\n0.99\n\n0.98\nLaAsFeO 0.90 200 K\n\n0.97\n\n0.96\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nVELOCITY(mm/s)\n\nFig.1.

For this composition, the sample is supposed to be SC. However, it appears that this system also\nexhibits SDW magnetic order at 95 K. At 200 K, Fig. 2, it displays a singlet and a very\ncomplicated magnetic spectrum of a foreign phase, which can be identified with high certainty to\nbe Fe2As [2]. The relative abundance of the foreign phase is 17\u00b12%.\n\nRELATIVE TRANSMISSION\n\n1 .0 0\n\n0 .9 9\nC e A s F e O 0 .8 6 F 0 .1 4 2 0 0 K\n\n0 .9 8\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nV E L O C IT Y (m m /s )\n\nFig. 2.

SmAsFeO is SDW system below 140-150 K, however the 200 K M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum,\nFig. 3, shows the presence of a foreign phase of 13\u00b12 % intensity. This impurity quadrupole\ndoublet (I.S.= 0.54(3) mm/s and QS=0.62(2) mm/s) can be identified with full certainty to be\nFeAs [3].\n\n3\n\n\fRELATIVE TRANSMISSION\n\n1 .0 0\n\n0 .9 9\n\n0 .9 8\n\n0 .9 7\n\nSm AsFeO 200K\n0 .9 6\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nV E L O C IT Y (m m /s )\n\nFig. 3.

However the doublet shown in Figs\n4-5 at 95 and 90 K (I.S.= 0.60 mm/s and QS= 0.66 mm/s) which accounts for 15% and 50%\nrespectively, is attributed to FeAs. Both samples exhibit magnetic order at 4.2 K. FeAs orders\nmagnetically at TN=77 K [7], thus the magnetic order in Figs. 4 -5 is presumably due to FeAs as an\nextra phase. This statement excludes our previous claim for coexistence of SC and magnetic order in\nthis material [8] and also \u03bcSR studies in SmAsFeO0.82F0.18 which observed complex magnetic\ncorrelations at low temperatures and relate them to the SC state.[9]\n\nRELATIVE TRANSMISSION\n\n1.000\n\n0.996\n\n95 K\n\n1.00\n\n0.99\n\nSmAsFeO 0.85\n4.2 K\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nVELOCITY (mm/s)\n\nFig. 4.

These systems are SDW and superconducting (TC=36 K) materials,\nrespectively. However Sr0.9K0.1Fe2As2 contains a high concentration (38%) of the magnetic\nFe2As (TN=353 K) as an impurity phase (Fig. 6), which is magnetically ordered even at room\ntemperature.

The Fe-As as extra phases\nare obtained regardless the preparation method of the desired materials. Such materials may\nlead to wrong conclusions. Our research shows that M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy of\n\n57\n\nFe in\n\nthese materials, even at room temperature, can easily discover the presence and amounts of\nFe containing foreign phases.\nAcknowledgments: This research is partially supported by the Israel Science Foundation\n(ISF, 2004 grant number: 618/04) and by the Klachky Foundation for Superconductivity.\nReferences\n1.
