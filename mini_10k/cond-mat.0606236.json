Cazalilla\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0606236v2 [cond-mat.stat-mech] 19 Jun 2006\n\nDonostia International Physics Center (DIPC), Manuel de Lardizabal 4, 20018-Donostia, Spain\nThe evolution of correlations in the exactly solvable Luttinger model (a model of interacting\nfermions in one dimension) after a sudden interaction switch-on is analytically studied. When the\nmodel is defined on a finite-size ring, zero-temperature correlations are periodic in time. However,\nin the thermodynamic limit, the system relaxes algebraically towards a stationary state which is\nwell described, at least for some simple correlation functions, by the generalized Gibbs ensemble\nrecently introduced by Rigol et al. [cond-mat/0604476]. The critical exponent that characterizes\nthe decay of the one-particle correlation function is different from the known equilibrium exponents.\nExperiments for which these results can be relevant are also discussed.\nPACS numbers:\n\nExperiments with cold atomic gases are motivating research into problems that, previously, would have looked\nhighly academic. One such problem concerns the evolution of a quantum many-body system where interactions\n(or other parameters of the system) are time-dependent.\nAn example is an interaction quench: an experiment\nwhere the strength of interactions is suddenly changed.\nThis type of experiment is nowadays feasible thanks to\nthe phenomenon known as Feshbach resonance [1, 2],\nwhich allows to tune the strength and sign of interactions in a cold atomic gas by means of a magnetic field.\nIf the applied magnetic field is time dependent, the interactions become time-dependent. Alternatively, in optical\nlattices [3], it is possible to change the lattice parameters\nin a time-dependent fashion, which effectively amounts to\nvarying the ratio of the interaction to the kinetic energy\nin time. On the theory side, the recent development of\nextensions of the density-matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) algorithm [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] has spurred the interest\nin understanding the properties of quantum many-body\nsystems out of equilibrium and, in particular, in the dynamics following a quench.\nBecause of these new possibilities, the evolution of observables and correlations following a sudden change of\nthe system parameters is attracting much theoretical interest [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. One interesting question that has been raised by a recent experiment\nin an array of 1D cold atomic gases [19] is whether after\na quench a system possessing an infinite number of integrals of motion can exhibit relaxation towards a steady\nstate or not. This question has been analyzed by the authors of Ref. [12], who have numerically shown that the\nsteady state of an integrable gas of hard-core bosons is\ndescribed by a generalized Gibbs distribution that maximizes the entropy with all possible constraints imposed\nby the existence of the (infinite number of) integrals of\nmotion. Here the effect of suddenly turning on the interactions in the Luttinger model is analytically studied.\nIt is shown that, when the model is defined on a finitesize ring, the asymptotic form of the two-point one-body\nand density correlations at zero temperature is periodic\n\nin time, and therefore the system exhibits no relaxation\nto a steady state with time-independent properties. In\nthe termodynamic limit, however, the same correlation\nfunctions relax to a steady state, whose properties are\ndifferent from those of the ground state. Indeed, the decay of the one-particle correlations with distance is governed by a critical exponent which is different from the\nknown equilibrium exponents. Interestingly, one-particle\nand density correlations in the steady state can be obtained using the generalized Gibbs ensemble introduced\nby Rigol et al. in Ref. [12].\nThe Luttinger model (LM) describes a system of interacting Fermions in one dimension (1D). It was introduced\nby Luttinger [20] in 1963, but the correct exact solution\nwas found in 1965 by Mattis and Lieb [21]. Asymptotic\nforms of one and two-particle correlations in equilibrium\nwere obtained by Luther and Peschel [22]. Later, Haldane [23, 24, 25] proposed that this model describes the\nlow-energy properties of a fairly broad class of systems\nin 1D known as Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids [23, 26, 27].\nThe Hamiltonian\nof the LM, HLM = H0 + H2 + H4 ,\nP\nwhere H0 = p,\u03b1 ~vF p : \u03c8\u03b1\u2020 (p)\u03c8\u03b1 (p) : is the free-fermion\nHamiltonian, and the interactions are described by\nH2 =\n\n2~\u03c0 X\ng2 (q) JR (q)JL (q),\nL q\n\n(1)\n\nH4 =\n\n~\u03c0 X\ng4 (q) : J\u03b1 (q)J\u03b1 (\u2212q) : ,\nL q,\u03b1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the Fermi operators {\u03c8\u03b1 (p), \u03c8\u03b2\u2020 (p\u2032 )} = \u03b4p,p\u2032 \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2\n(\u03b1, \u03b2 = L, R) and anti-commute otherwise. To avoid\na degenerate ground state, anti-periodic boundary conditions are chosen:\n\u221a \u03c8\u03b1 (x + L) = \u2212\u03c8\u03b1 (x), (\u03c8\u03b1 (x) =\nP\nis\u03b1 px\ne\n\u03c8\n(p)/\nL is the Fermi field operator and\n\u03b1\np\nsR = \u2212sL = +1 and L the length of the system) so\nthat p = 2\u03c0(n \u2212 21 )/L, and\nP n is an integer. The \"current\" operators J\u03b1 (q) = q : \u03c8\u03b1\u2020 (p + q)\u03c8\u03b1 (p) :, where\nq = 2\u03c0m/L, m being an integer; : . . . : stands for the\nnormal order prescription according to which all creation\noperators are to be found to the left of the annihilation\noperators and expectation values over the ground state\n\n\f2\nof H0 are subtracted. Thus, the above model describes\na system of fermions interacting via the four Fermion\nterms H2 and H4 . Fermions come in two chiralities, R\nstanding for right moving and L for left moving particles, respectively. The dispersion is linear and therefore\nit is not bounded from below. To define a stable ground\nstate for H0 all single-particle levels with p < 0 are filled\nup for both chiralities, which yields a Dirac sea (i.e. an\n\"infinite story\" hotel) which will be denoted as |0i. The\ncoupling functions g2 (q) and g4 (q) are assumed to be finite for q = 0. Moreover, to ensure that the Hilbert\nspace of HLM and H0 remain the same and, in particular, that their ground states have a finite overlap at finite\nL, g2 (q)/(vF + g4 (q)) \u2192 0 faster than |q|\u22121/2 as |q| \u2192 \u221e\nand |g2 (q)| < vF + g4 (q) for all q [24].\nThe currents obey a Kac-Moody algebra [24, 26,\n\u2032\n27]: [J\u03b1 (q), J\u03b2 (q \u2032 )] = qL\nThis fact al2\u03c0 \u03b4q+q ,0 \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 .\nlows to introduce, for q 6= 0, the following operators\n1/2\nb0 (q) = \u2212i (2\u03c0/|q|L) [\u03b8(q)JR (\u2212q) \u2212 \u03b8(\u2212q)JL (q)] and\n1/2\nb\u20200 (q) = i (2\u03c0/|q|L) [\u03b8(q)JR (q) \u2212 \u03b8(\u2212q)JL (\u2212q)], which\nobey the standard algebra of boson (\"phonon\") operators. Moreover, there are two conserved operators\n\u03b4N = NR + NL , i.e. the number operator referred to\nthe ground state |0i, and the total current J = NR \u2212 NL ,\nwhere N\u03b1 = J\u03b1 (0). For fermions, the physical states\nobey the selection rule (\u22121)\u03b4N = (\u22121)J . In terms of\nthe boson operators b\u20200 (q), b0 (q) the Hamiltonian HLM is\nquadratic but not diagonal. It can be diagonalized by\nmeans of a Bogoliubov ('squeezing') transformation [21]:\nb(q) =\n\u2020\n\nb (q) =\n\ncosh \u03c6(q) b0 (q) + sinh \u03c6(q) b\u20200 (\u2212q),\nsinh \u03c6(q) b0 (\u2212q) + cosh \u03c6(q) b\u20200 (q).\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nTo render HLM diagonal, we must choose tanh 2\u03c6(q) =\ng2 (q)/[vF + gP\n4 (q)]. Thus the Hamiltonian becomes [24]\n\u2020\n2\nHLM =\nq6=0 ~v(q)|q|b (q)b(q) + ~\u03c0vN \u03b4N /L +\n~\u03c0vJ J 2 /L, where v(q) = [(vF + g4 (q))2 \u2212 g22 (q)]1/2 ,\nvN = ve2\u03c6 , and [24] vJ = ve\u22122\u03c6 , being v = v(0) and\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(0).\nLet us now consider an interaction quench in the LM.\nHere I consider only the case where the coupling functions g2 (q) and g4 (q) are suddenly switched on at t = 0.\nThus, the initial state of the system will be described by\na thermal distribution determined by the non-interacting\nHamiltonian H0 , \u03c1(t = 0) = \u03c10 = e\u2212H0 /T /Z0 , where\nZ0 = Tr e\u2212H0 /T . However, for t > 0, the evolution is\ndictated by the full Hamiltonian HLM . A more general type of quench corresponds to a sudden switch between two different forms of g2 (q) and g4 (q). Whereas\nthe results described below can be generalized to such a\ncase, I believe a quench from the non-interacting limit\nis most interesting because the spectrum of H0 contains free fermions whereas the spectrum of HLM does\nnot [22, 24, 26, 27]. Thus, a sudden switch-on of the interactions describes a time-dependent destruction of the\n\ncharacteristic discontinuity of the momentum distribution at the Fermi points p = 0.\nEqual time correlations of a given operator O(x),\nCO (x, t) = heiHLM t/~ O\u2020 (x)O(0)e\u2212iHLM t/~ i0\n(5)\niHLM t/~ \u2020\n\u2212iHLM t/~\n= Tr \u03c10 e\nO (x)O(0)e\n. (6)\nNote that since [H0 , HLM ] 6= 0, CO (x, t) is explicitly\ntime-dependent. Indeed, in the LM model time dependence stems from H2 , since [H0 , H4 ] = 0. H2 describes\nscattering between fermions moving in opposite directions, and, as shown below, it produces entanglement\nbetween the excitation modes with q > 0 and q < 0.\nThe exact evolution of b0 (q) has a fairly simple form:\nb0 (q, t) = f (q, t)b0 (q) + g \u2217 (q, t)b\u20200 (\u2212q),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere b0 (q, t) = eiHLM t/~ b0 (q)e\u2212iHLM t/~ , f (q, t) =\ncos v(q)|q|t \u2212 i sin v(q)|q|t cosh 2\u03c6(q), and g(q, t) =\ni sin v(q)|q|t sinh 2\u03c6(q). Note that this form obeys the\ncorrect boundary condition b0 (q, 0) = b0 (q). Entanglement between modes of opposite q vanishes for \u03c6(q) = 0\n(i.e. g2 (q) = 0) in agreement with the above discussion.\nThe evolution of one-particle correlations (i.e. O(x) =\n\u03c8\u03b1 (x)) can be obtained from Eq. (7) and the bosonization\nformula [22, 24, 26, 27]:\n\u03c8\u03b1 (x) =\n\n\u03b7\u03b1\neis\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1 (x) ,\n(2\u03c0a)1/2\n\n(8)\n\nbeing \u03b7R 6= \u03b7L two different Pauli matrices that\nensure the anti-commutation of the left and rightmoving Fermi fields; \u03c6\u03b1 (x) = s\u03b1 \u03c60\u03b1 + 2\u03c0xN\u03b1 /L +\n\u03a6\u2020\u03b1 (x) + \u03a6\u03b1 (x), where [N\u03b1 , \u03c60\u03b2 ] = i\u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 , \u03a6\u03b1 (x) =\nP\n1/2 \u2212qa/2 iqx \u2020\ne\ne b0 (q), and a \u2192 0+ . Setting\nq>0 (2\u03c0/qL)\nsinh 2\u03c6(q) = e\u2212|qR0 |/2 sinh \u03c6, where R0 \u226a L is of the\norder of the range of the interactions, and replacing v(q)\nby its q = 0 value [22], simplifies the calculations without altering the asymptotic form of the correlations. At\nT = 0, for a system of size L, one-body correlations are\ngiven by the following expression [31]:\n\u0015\u03b3 2\nR0\nC\u03c8R (x, t > 0|L) =\nd(x|L)\n\u0015\u03b3 2 /2\n\u0014\nd(x \u2212 2vt|L)d(x + 2vt|L)\n,\n\u00d7\n[d(2vt|L)]2\n(0)\nGR (x|L)\n\n\u0014\n\n(9)\n\nwhere d(x|L) = L| sin(\u03c0x/L)|/\u03c0 is the cord function,\n(0)\nGR (x|L) = i/[2L sin \u03c0(x + ia)/L] the non-interacing\ncorrelation function, and \u03b3 = sinh 2\u03c6. The above\nexpression is accurate asymptotically, i.e. for d(x \u00b1\n2vt|L), d(x|L), d(2vt|L) \u226b R0 . It can be seen that the\none-particle correlations are periodic in time: C\u03c8R (x, t +\nT0 |L) = C\u03c8R (x, t|L) with T0 = L/2v. This implies\nthat the finite-size LM does not relax, which is a consequence of the (approximately) linear dispersion of the\n\n\f3\neigenmodes near q = 0 along with the absence of any\ndamping mechanisms in the LM (see discussion at the\nend). However, in the thermodynamic limit, L \u2192 \u221e,\nand d(x|L) \u2192 |x|. Therefore, Eq. (9) becomes:\nR0\ni\nC\u03c8R (x, t > 0) =\n2\u03c0(x + ia) x\n\n\u03b32\n\nx2 \u2212 (2vt)2\n(2vt)2\n\n\u03b3 2 /2\n\n.\n\n(10)\nIt is interesting to analyze the above expression in the\nlimit where 2vt \u226a |x|, where it becomes\nC\u03c8R (R0 \u226a 2vt \u226a |x|) \u2248\n\niZ(t)\n,\n2\u03c0(x + ia)\n\n(11)\n\n2\n\nbeing Z(t) = (R0 /2vt)\u03b3 a time-dependent renormalization constant of the Fermi quasi-particles. Thus for\nshort-times the system behaves as a Femi liquid, with a\nsingularity at the Fermi points given by Z(t), which decreases with time. On the other hand, for 2vt \u226b |x| the\ncorrelation takes a non-Fermi liquid form:\ni\nR0\nC\u03c8R (R0 \u226a |x| \u226a 2vt) \u2248\n2\u03c0(x + ia) x\n\ntion of b0 (q) and b\u20200 (q). However, the (density) operator JR (x) = \u2202x \u03c6R (x)/2\u03c0 also exhibits relaxation. Setting O(x) = JR (x) in (6), the following is obtained using\nEq. (7),\n1 n 1 + \u03b32\nCJR (x, t|L) = \u2212 2\n4\u03c0 [d(x|L)]2\no\n\u03b32\n\u03b32\n.(13)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2[d(x \u2212 2vt)]\n2[d(x + 2vt)]\nFor finite L the density correlation function is again periodic in time. However, for L \u2192 \u221e, it shows relaxation: CJR (x, t \u2192 \u221e|L) \u2192 \u2212(1 + \u03b3 2 )/(4\u03c0 2 x2 ). This\nform again deviates from the ground state behavior,\nwhere the prefactor of \u22121/(4\u03c0 2 x2 ) is cosh 2\u03c6 \u2212 sinh 2\u03c6 =\ne\u22122\u03c6 [24, 26, 27].\nIt is interesting to find that the above results in the\nt \u2192 \u221e limit can be analytically obtained from the generalized Gibbs distribution introduced in Ref. [12], which\nis described by the following density matrix:\n\u03c1gG =\n\n\u03b32\n\n(12)\n\nIn particular, in the limit t \u2192 +\u221e one-particle correlations relax to the power-law in the right-hand side of\nEq. (12). Notice that, although C\u03c8R (x, t \u2192 \u221e) exhibits\na power-law behavior, the latter is governed by an exponent that is different from the one that governs asymptotic ground-state correlations [22, 24], \u03b302 = 2 sinh2 \u03c6 <\n\u03b3 2 = sinh2 2\u03c6 for \u03c6 6= 0. The origin of this new exponent\nwill be discussed below.\nThe different behavior of C\u03c8R (x, t) for short and long\ntimes can be understood in terms of a 'light-cone' effect [11]: The initial state |0i has higher energy than\nthe ground state of HLM (see discussion further below). Therefore, it contains long wave-length phonons\nthat propagate from time = 0 to time = t along lightcones where the role of speed of light is played by v.\nThese excitations determine which points retain the same\ntype of correlations found in |0i and which points acquire\nnew correlations. The latter phenomenon and the overall structure of (10) bears some resemblance to results\nreported in Ref. [11]. Nevertheless, I have so far failed\nto extend the methods of [11] to the quench in the LM.\nThere are two main differences: the initial state in the\npresent case is non-critical, and therefore it does not have\nany characteristic (gap) energy scale as the initial states\nconsidered in [11]. Secondly, and more importantly, the\ncritical exponent found above is different from the bulk\nor boundary exponents of the field operator \u03c8R (x). Indeed, this may be an indication that the quench in the\nLM belongs to a different universality class.\nOne may think that the relaxation behavior exhibited by C\u03c8R (x, t) in the thermodynamic limit is because the field operator, \u03c8R (x), is a non-linear func-\n\n1 P \u03bb(q)I(q)\ne\n,\nZgG\n\n(14)\n\nP\n\nwhere ZgG = Tr e \u03bb(q)I(q) and [H, I(q)] = [I(q), I(q \u2032 )] =\n0, that is, a set of independent integrals of motion. Since\n[HLM , n(q)] = 0, where n(q) = b\u2020 (q)b(q), the phonon\noccupancy operators seem as the most natural choice for\nI(q). The Lagrange multipliers \u03bb(q) are obtained from\nthe condition [12]:\nhn(q)it=0 = h0|n(q)|0i = hn(q)igG = Tr [\u03c1gG n(q)] , (15)\nwhere T = 0 was assumed. Using (3,4), h0|n(q)|0i =\nsinh2 \u03c6(q), which is a non-thermal distribution. However,\n\u03bb(q) do not need to obtained explicitly, as it suffices to\nrealize that \u03c1gG has the same form as the\nP distribution in\nthe canonical ensemble with H/T = \u2212 q \u03bb(q)n(q). One\ncan also regard \u03c1gG as a canonical distribution with a qdependent temperature, T (q) = \u2212~v(q)|q|/\u03bb(q). Using\nthis fact along with equations (3,4) and (8), I find that\n\u2020\n(x) = Tr \u03c1gG \u03c8R\n(x)\u03c8R (0) = lim C\u03c8R (x, t), (16)\nC\u03c8gG\nR\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nCJgG\n(x) = Tr \u03c1gG JR (x)JR (0) = lim CJR (x, t). (17)\nR\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nThus, at least for these simple correlation functions,\nit seems that the generalized Gibbs distribution describes the stationary state of the LM after an interaction quench. The reason why the critical exponent\n\u03b3 2 turns out to be different from the known equilibrium exponents can be thus explained in two different\nways: mathematically, it is seen that in order to obtain the evolution of the operator b0 (q), Eq (7), one\nhas to do and undo the Bogoliubov transformation (3,4).\nHowever, these transformations do not cancel each other\nexactly (except at t = 0) because of the phase factors e\u00b1iv(q)|q|t introduced by the time evolution operator. In contrast, in the equilibrium problem, since\n\n\f4\nthe expectation value is taken over the ground state\nof HLM , the Bogoliubov transformation is performed\nonly once. Physically, in view of the results (16,17),\nthe difference in exponent can be regarded a consequence of the non-equilibrium distribution of phonons\nh0|n(q)|0i = sinh2 \u03c6(q), which is a constant of motion.\n\u2032\n\u2032\n)|0i\u2212 h0|n(q)|0ih0|n(q\n)|0i =\n\u0002Note 4as well that h0|n(q)n(q\n\u0003\n2\n2\nsinh \u03c6(q) + 2 cosh \u03c6(q) sinh \u03c6(q) \u03b4q,q\u2032 is non-zero for\nq = q \u2032 , since |0i is not an eigenstate of HLM for g2 (q) 6= 0.\nLet us finally consider how the above predictions could\nbe experimentally observed. To date, there are no exact realizations of the LM in nature. However, one can\nexploit the fact that the LM describes the low-energy\nproperties of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids [24, 26, 27], of\nwhich several physical realizations in cold atomic gases\nare available [19, 28, 29]. Let us therefore consider a\nsingle-species cold Fermi gas confined to 1D in a strongly\nanisotropic trap [29]. In a single-species cold Fermi gas,\nthe p-wave interaction is naturally negligible. One possibility to realize a sudden change of the interaction is\nto use a p-wave Feshbach resonance [29], which enhances\nthe strength of this interaction. Alternatively, one can\nuse a 1D dipolar Fermi gas, where interactions at long\ndistances are described by the potential:\nVdip (x) =\n\n1 D2 (1 \u2212 3 cos \u03b8)\n,\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 [x2 + R02 ]3/2\n\ntimes and, since they dominate the long-time dynamics, the behavior of the correlations will be described by\nthe above results. Thus, if the quench was conducted\nat zero temperature, since the atomic systems are finite,\nan approximately periodic behavior of correlations can\nbe expected. However, Fermi gases are usually hard to\ncool down, and a situation where temperature is larger\nthan level spacing (i.e. T \u226b \u03c0/L) is perfectly reallistic. In this situation, one should consider correlations\nat finite T , neglecting finite size effects. The latter can\nbe obtained from Eq. (9) upon replacing L sin(\u03c0x/L)/\u03c0\nby (~vF /\u03c0T ) sinh(\u03c0T x/~vF ), etc. Thus relaxation takes\nplace because temperature induces a finite correlation\nlength in the initial state and therefore correlations decay exponentially. One-body correlations that can be\naccessed through the momentum distribution, which can\nbe measured in a time of light experiment. Thus the\nsteady state momentum distribution following a sudden\nswitch-on of interactions should differ from the equilibrium distribution at the same tempereature. A more detailed analysis will be given elsewhere [30].\nThis work was supported by Gipuzkoako Foru Aldundia\nand MEC (Spain) under grant FIS2004-06490-C03-00.\n\n(18)\n\nD being the dipolar momentum of the atoms and \u03b8 is\nthe angle subtended by the direction of the atomic motion and an electric field (or magnetic, for magnetic\ndipoles) that polarizes the gas. In the above expression R0 is of the order of the transverse size of the\ncloud. The Fourier transform of (18), g2 (q) = g4 (q) \u221d\nVdip (q) = \u03bb(\u03b8)|qR0 |K1 (|qR0 |), where \u03bb(\u03b8) = D2 (1 \u2212\n3 cos \u03b8)/2\u03c0\u01eb0 R02 and K1 (x) is the first order modified\nBessel function. An sudden switch-on of Vdip (q) can be\nrealized by deviating the electric field that polarizes the\ngas from the \"magic\" angle \u03b8m = cos\u22121 ( 13 ), for which the\ninteraction vanishes (i.e. \u03bb(\u03b8m ) = 0).\nHowever, the full Hamiltonian for a TLL contains an\ninfinite series of terms that spoil the integrability of the\nLM [23, 24]. Roughly speaking, these stem from the\nnon-linearity of the fermion dispersion [32] and the fact\nthat interactions couple right and left-moving modes in\na way that is highly non-linear in terms of the boson\nfields \u03c6\u03b1 (x) (umklapp scattering) [23]. In a TLL all\nthese deviations are irrelevant in the renormalizationgroup sense, which means that their effect on low-energy\nstates is small. Nevertheless, after a sudden change of\nthe interaction in the systems described above, highenergy excitations will be created that are not described\nby the LM. Exciting many fermions to levels very far\nfrom the Fermi level where the LM description is not accurate can be avoided by turning on the interaction to\na value much smaller than the Fermi energy. On the\nother hand, low energy excitations will survive for longer\n\n[1] J. L. Roberts, N. R. Claussen, J. P. B. Jr., C. H. Greene,\nE. A. Cornell, and C. E. Wienman, Phys. Rev.
