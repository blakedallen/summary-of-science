A device is\nproposed that achieves spin filtering without using ferromagnets or the Zeeman effect.\nPACS numbers: 72.25.-b, 73.63.Nm, 73.23.Ad, 73.40.Gk\n\nSpintronics is an emerging field of electronics where the\nelectron's spin is exploited as well as its charge[1]. Operation of most spintronic devices is based on the ability\nto create spin-polarized charge carriers in nonmagnetic\nsemiconductors. This requirement has spurred recent interest in the investigation of possible mechanisms and\nlimitations of spin filtering. Simply using Zeeman splitting of spin states is not the most practical way to achieve\nspin filtering, as needed magnetic-field strengths are often\nlarge and on-chip placement of micromagnets is required.\nMore promising approaches employ hybrid structures[2]\nwith metallic[3, 4, 5] or semiconducting[6, 7, 8] magnetic\ncontacts. However, fabrication of these structures can\npose material-science challenges[9, 10, 11] and may require rather complicated chip design. Achieving spin\nfiltering by means of intrinsic spin-dependent effects in\nsemiconductors is therefore highly desirable and also\nvery intriguing from a fundamental-science point of view.\nFor example, optical excitation from spin-split hole subbands in asymmetric quantum heterostructures can be\nused[12, 13] to create spin-polarized currents without ferromagnets or magnetic fields. Similarly, resonant transmission through spin-orbit-split quasi-bound states in\nsemiconductor nanostructures is spin selective and may\nlead to significant polarization of electron current[14, 15].\nHere we propose a spin-filtering device based on the\ninterplay of the Rashba effect[16, 17] and wave-number\nselectivity due to momentum-resolved tunneling[18] between parallel electron wave guides. Spin-polarized currents are created by applying voltages or small magnetic\nfields. Switching between opposite spin polarizations is\neasily achieved. Verification of spin filtering in the device\nis possible via measurement of the differential tunneling\nconductance, which would yield the first direct observation of Rashba-spin-split electron dispersion curves.\nThe basic setup, shown in Fig. 1a, consists of two parallel one-dimensional (1D) electron wave guides (quantum\nwires) that are coupled via tunneling through a clean,\nuniform, nonmagnetic barrier of finite length L. Such a\nsystem can be realized, e.g., by quantum confinement of\nelectrons in semiconductor heterostructures using splitgate techniques[18, 19] or cleaved-edge overgrowth[20].\nCoupling of the quantum wires via the tunneling barrier\nresults in a finite quantum-mechanical probability amplitude tk,k\u2032 for electrons to leave a state with wave number\n\na\n\nI2\n\nVU\n\nI4\n\nVL\n\nB\nVg\nI1\n\nI3\nVU\n\nVL\n\nb\n\nc\n1\n\n3\n\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n\n3\n\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic picture of spin-filtering device and spinpolarized currents. a, Two parallel quantum wires, labeled\n'U' and 'L', are each connected to reservoirs having equal\nchemical potential VU and VL . The wires are coupled via tunneling through an extended uniform barrier. A gate voltage\nVg is used to control Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the two\nwires. b, Reservoir 1 (2) injects right-moving (left-moving)\nelectrons into the upper wire. Shown is the situation where\nwave-number selectivity and Pauli blocking prevents tunneling into the lower wire. c, Interplay of spin-orbit coupling\nand wave-number selectivity can be used to selectively enable\ntunneling for right-moving spin-up electrons. Then, a spinpolarized current is flowing from reservoir 2 to reservoir 4.\n\nk in one wire and occupy a state with wave number k \u2032\nin the other wire. Translational invariance along an extended uniform barrier implies approximate conservation\nof canonical momentum in a single tunneling event. This\nis seen from the explicit form of the tunneling matrix\nelement[21, 22], given by\ntk,k\u2032 = 2t\n\nsin [(k \u2032 \u2212 k)L/2]\nk\u2032 \u2212 k\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhose squared modulus exhibits a delta-function-like\npeak for k = k \u2032 with height |t|2 L2 and width 2\u03c0/L.\nThe spin state of tunneling electrons remains unchanged. Hence, tunneling between parallel quantum\nwires is a highly wave-number-selective but entirely spininsensitive process.\n\n\f2\n\nh\u03042\n2\n(k \u2212 \u03c3kso ) \u2212 \u2206so .\n(2)\n2m\nHere, the spin quantum number \u03c3 distinguishes spin-up\n(\u03c3 = 1) and spin-down (\u03c3 = \u22121) electron eigenstates[31].\nThe effective mass of electrons is denoted by m, E0 is\n2\nthe 1D subband energy, and \u2206so = h\u03042 kso\n/(2m). The\nstrength of spin-orbit coupling can be expressed in terms\nof a characteristic wave number, denoted here by kso .\nExperimental efforts[25, 26, 27] aimed at the realization\nof an early proposal[28] for a spin-controlled field-effect\ntransistor established tunability of kso by external gate\nvoltages. In our device (see Fig. 1a), the voltage Vg is\nused to achieve different strengths of Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling in the two wires. In that situation, tunneling\ntransport across the barrier provides a direct measurement of the Rashba effect. The differential tunneling\nconductance, calculated using standard perturbation theory within the tunneling-Hamiltonian formalism[22, 29],\nis shown in Fig. 2. It provides a direct image of the spinresolved parabolic dispersion curves given by Eq. (2).\nMonitoring the differential tunneling conductance would\nbe the most immediate possibility to observe and study\nspectral consequences of the Rashba effect in 1D. So far,\nexperimental studies[25, 26, 27] have focused on extracting the value of Rashba-induced zero-field spin splitting\nin 2D systems from the analysis of beating patterns in\nthe Shubnikov\u2013de Haas oscillations.\nWhen a picture like Fig. 2 is obtained for the differential tunneling conductance, the double-wire system can\nbe used for spin filtering. To simplify the explanation of\nits basic operational modes as a spin polarizer and a spin\nsplitter, we consider here the special case where Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling is finite in the upper wire (labeled U)\nbut vanishes in the lower wire (labeled L)[32].\nTaking into account a finite subband-energy difference\n(U)\n(L)\n\u2206E0 = E0 \u2212 E0 , electronic dispersion relations look\nlike shown in Fig. 3a. Only states with energies below\n(U)\n(L)\nE0 + \u03b5F,U in the upper wire (below E0 + \u03b5F,L in\nthe lower wire) are occupied by electrons. Due to wavenumber selectivity, tunneling can only occur for electron\nstates with wave number close to a point where the dispersion curves of the two wires cross[22]. In the case\ndepicted in Fig. 3a, no such crossings occur for states\nthat are occupied in either one of the two wires, and no\ntunneling current can flow. All electrons injected into\nEk\u03c3 = E0 +\n\n>1\n2\n0.5\np B /k F,L\n\nIn our device, wave-number selectivity is utilized for\nspin filtering by means of an intrinsic coupling of electron\nspin to its momentum. Such a spin-orbit coupling originates from structural inversion asymmetry[16, 23, 24]\npresent in quantum-confined systems. This effect renders the kinetic energy of an electron with canonical momentum h\u0304k dependent on its spin state[17]. To illustrate\nthe basic physics, we consider here only the lowest 1D\nsubband in a quantum wire and neglect subband mixing.\nThen the electronic dispersion is given by\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u22120.5\n0\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\neV/ \u03b5F,L\n\n1\n\n2\n\n< \u22121\n\nFIG. 2: Color plot of the differential tunneling conductance, shown in arbitrary units, as function of voltage bias\nV = VU \u2212 VL and a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane\nof the wires. The magnetic-field strength is proportional to\nthe parameter pB defined in the text. Red and blue resonance\nfeatures map out electronic dispersion curves in the two wires.\nAppearance of two sets of identical parabolic curves that are\nshifted in magnetic-field direction are the unambiguous signature of Rashba spin-orbit coupling of different strength in the\ntwo wires. For simplicity, it was assumed in our calculation\nthat the strength of Rashba spin-orbit coupling is finite in the\nupper wire but vanishes in the lower wire. We then use the\nlower wire's Fermi wave number kF,L and Fermi energy \u03b5F,L\nas wave-number and energy units, respectively. Parameters\nused in the calculation are \u2206E0 = 0.15 \u03b5F,L , kso = 0.1 kF,L ,\nL = 100/kF,L .\n\nthe upper wire from reservoirs 1 and 2 remain in the upper wire (Fig. 1b). This situation can change when a\nmagnetic field B is applied perpendicular to the plane\nof the two wires. It leads to a relative shift[22] of the\ntwo wires' dispersion curves in wave-number direction by\npB = \u2212eBd/h\u0304, where \u2212e is the electron charge, and d\nthe wire separation. For particular values of magnetic\nfield, namely whenever the condition\npB =\n\n\u03c0\n(\u03b3nU \u2212 \u03b3 \u2032 nL ) \u2212 \u03c3kso\n2\n\n(3)\n\nis satisfied with \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 = \u00b11 and nU(L) denoting electron\ndensity in the upper (lower) wire, tunneling is enabled\nfor electrons in spin state \u03c3. Simultaneous tunneling of\nelectrons with opposite spin will be prohibited for high\nenough wave-number selectivity, i.e., if \u03c0/L \u226a kso . The\ncase corresponding to \u03b3 = \u03b3 \u2032 = +1 is depicted in Fig. 3b.\nIn that situation, a spin-polarized current of electrons\nfrom reservoir 1 reaches reservoir 4. As shown in Fig. 1c,\nit is compensated globally by the current of spin-up electrons from reservoir 2 that can only reach reservoir 1.\nUsing the standard scattering-theory formalism[30] for\ncalculating electron transport, we have obtained the linear conductance for tunneling across the barrier. Our\nresults, given in Fig. 4a, show the four resonances deter-\n\n\f3\n\nB=0\neV=0\n\nB=0\neV=0\n\nB=0\neV=0\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\n\u2206E0\n\n2kso\n\nk\n\na\n\ntunneling\nwave numbers\nk\n\nPolarizer\nb\n\nSplitter\nc\n\nk\n\nFIG. 3: Illustration of device operation as spin polarizer or\nspin splitter a, Due to the Rashba effect, dispersion curves\nfor spin-up and spin-down electrons in the upper wire are\nshifted horizontally by 2kso . In the lower wire, where spinorbit coupling is assumed to be absent, energy dispersions\nare spin-degenerate. b, Tuning wave-number selectivity by\na magnetic field B, tunneling is selectively enabled for rightmoving electrons with spin up. c, At a certain value of voltage\nV , tunneling becomes possible for left-moving spin-down electrons and right-moving spin-up electrons. Note that parabolicity of electron bands is not essential to achieve coincidences\nand, hence, spin-polarized currents.\n\nmined by solutions of Eq. (3) which exhibit almost perfect\nspin polarization of the tunneling current. We emphasize\nthat the applied magnetic field, used here simply to tune\nwave-number selectivity, is typically much smaller than\nthe field required to achieve spin-filtering from Zeeman\nsplitting. Tuning between the four resonances allows the\ndouble-quantum-wire system to be used as a switchable\nspin-polarizer. Analyzing the resonance condition given\nby Eq. (3) from a fundamental point of view, we realize that this is possible because Rashba spin-orbit coupling enters the single\u2013particle Hamiltonian like a spindependent vector potential.\nIntriguingly, spin-polarized currents can be created in\nour device without applying any magnetic field at all.\nInstead, a finite bias voltage V = VU \u2212 VL can be used to\ninduce a relative shift \u2212eV of the two wires' dispersion\ncurves in energy direction[33]. This way, coincidences are\ncreated for electron states with spin \u03c3 and wave number\nk satisfying\neV = \u2206E0 \u2212\n\nh\u03042\nkso \u03c3 k\nm\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nIf such a state is occupied by an electron in one wire and\nempty in the other one, it will contribute to the tunneling\ncurrent. A situation where current flow is made possible\nby the applied voltage is depicted in Fig. 3c. Tunneling is\nsimultaneously enabled for electrons having opposite spin\nand wave number, which will end up in opposite leads of\nthe wire they have tunneled into. For large enough wavenumber selectivity, tunneling for a particular spin species\nturns out to occur, if at all, only for wave numbers of one\n\nsign. As a result, currents flowing in the leads of the\ndouble-wire device are fully spin-polarized. This is seen\nin Fig. 4b for a particular set of parameters. Currents in\nleads 1 and 3 have the same spin polarization, which is\nopposite to that in leads 2 and 4. Selection of spin-up or\nspin-down polarization for currents in leads 1 and 3 (2\nand 4) is possible simply by adjusting the voltage. While\nno global spin imbalance is created, wave-number selectivity leads to a redistribution of spin-polarized currents\nbetween the four leads. Thereby, spin filtering is possible without any magnetic or exchange fields. Note that\nwave-number selectivity provides the most direct way to\nutilize the Rashba effect for spin filtering. Hence, besides\nopening up an interesting alternative to previously suggested energy-selective mechanisms[15], our device offers\ncertain advantages that may be important for application\nin spintronics[34].\nThree mechanisms limit functionality of a real doublewire system as a spin-filtering device. First, wave-number\nselectivity is reduced by disorder. However, the successful measurement of 1D dispersion curves for parallel\nquantum wires in GaAlAs heterostructures[20] demonstrates the possibility to achieve sufficient wave-number\nselectivity using present-day technology. While this particular system cannot be used for spin filtering due to its\nnegligible Rashba effect, similar structures could be created in more suitable materials. Second, quantum wires\nare really multi-channel 1D wave guides for electrons.\nSpin-orbit coupling induces mixing between these channels (subbands), which was neglected in our discussion so\nfar. Detailed analysis[28] shows that subband mixing can\nbe safely neglected as long as the energy difference between consecutive quasi-1D subbands is much larger than\n\u2206so . In present-day samples, this requirement is easily\nmet for realistic values[25, 26, 27] of kso . Finally, our conclusions apply at temperatures T low enough such that\nsmearing of the Fermi function does not substantially\ndecrease wave-number selectivity. The relevant criterion\n2\nkB T <\n\u223c h\u0304 kso kF,L /m translates, for typical sample parameters, into T <\n\u223c 10 K. This temperature range is routinely accessible in semiconductor-research laboratories\nwhere our basic design for a spin-filtering device could\nbe demonstrated.\nExperimental tests for the successful operation of our\ndevice as spin polarizer or spin splitter could be based on\nthe usual spin-detection mechanisms, applied to currents\nleaving or entering any of the four leads. For example,\nferromagnetic contacts can serve as spin analyzers, or\nspin polarization of charge carriers could be measured\noptically[5, 6, 7, 8]. Results of such experiments will\nbe determined not only by the efficiency of spin filtering\nin the double-wire system but also by spin-equilibration\nprocesses in the leads. An equally significant test is provided by measurement of the differential tunneling conductance as a function of magnetic field and transport\nvoltage.

In the spin-splitter\nmode, we have I4tot = I3tot = \u2212I2tot = \u2212I1tot . We show I3tot vs.\nbias voltage V = VU \u2212 VL (dotted curve). It is appreciable\nonly in finite ranges of voltage where states near points of coincidence for the wires' dispersion curves are occupied in one\nwire but empty in the other one. Within these voltage intervals, total current in each lead is practically 100% polarized.\nThis is seen from comparing I3tot with I3pol (solid curve) and\nI4pol (dashed curve).

This is different in the T-junction device of Kiselev and Kim [15] where resonance with quasizerodimensional bound states is essential to achieve appreciable spin filtering but, at the same time, results in\nalmost complete backscattering.\n\n\f"}
