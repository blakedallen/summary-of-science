Introduction\nProblems of mathematical modeling of large systems of various nature (economical, mechanical, ecological, etc) motivate studying random geometric, topological and algebraic objects. For a system of great\ncomplexity, it is unrealistic to assume that one may have a precise description of its configuration space; it is more reasonable to view it as\na partially known or a random space.\nStudying random topological and algebraic objects instead of their\ndeterministic analogues has several major advantages. Firstly, random\nmathematical objects in many cases more adequately reflect reality.\nSecondly, random objects are often simpler mathematically since exotic\nand most complicated examples can be ignored if they are rare, i.e.\nappear with very small probability.\nFinally, the probabilistic method is useful in proving existence theorems and in building new objects and counter-examples. Recently\nGromov [20] used the theory of random groups to prove the existence\nDate: January 6, 2011.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The fundamental groups of random 2-complexes are random\ngroups of a fairly general type: clearly this model covers all finitely\npresented groups. In a recent paper E. Babson, C. Hoffman and M.\nKahle [2] show that a random group in this model is hyperbolic (or\ntrivial)1. This result is of great interest since it is known that many\ndelicate problems of group theory are algorithmically solvable for hyperbolic groups. Paper [8] establishes a threshold for freeness of a\nrandom group produced by the Linial - Meshulam model.\nConfiguration spaces of mechanical linkages with random bar lengths\nwere studied in papers [17], [18]. These are closed smooth manifolds\ndepending on a large number of independent random parameters. Although the number of homeomorphism types of these manifolds grows\nextremely fast with dimension, their topological characteristics can be\npredicted with high probability when the number of links tends to infinity.\nThe theory of random groups was initiated by M. Gromov [19], [20]\nwho proposed several different models generating random groups. One\nof this models (called the density model) has a density parameter 0 \u2264\nd \u2264 1. A random group in this model is given by a presentation\nG = ha1 , . . . , am | R i where the number of generators m \u2265 2 is fixed\nand the set of relations R consists of (2m \u2212 1)dl words which are picked\nrandomly from the set Sl of all reduced words in a1 , . . . , am of length l.\nOne is interested in probabilities of various properties of these groups as\nthe length parameter l tends to infinity. One says that a group property\nholds with overwhelming probability if the probability of its occurence\ntends to 1 as l \u2192 \u221e. The striking phase transition theorem of Gromov\nstates that in the density model, with overwhelming probability, for d <\n1/2 a random group is infinite, hyperbolic, torsion free, of geometric\ndimension 2, while for d > 1/2 it is either Z2 or trivial; see [19], pp.\n273-275 and [30], page 31. We refer also to [30] for more details.\n1\n\nThe result of [2] leaves open the possibility that a random group in the LinialMeshulam model with probability parameter p near n\u22121/2 is not hyperbolic.\n\n\fRANDOM GRAPH GROUPS\n\n3\n\nIn [33] A. Zuk studied an interesting model of random groups (the\ntriangular model) where all relations have length 3 but the number of\ngenerators m is not fixed and tends to infinity. We refer to [30], page\n41 where this model is compared with the Gromov density model.\nThe article [32] is a recent survey of probabilistic group theory. We\nalso refer to a recent paper [22] which compares different models of\nrandom groups.\nGiven a finite graph (i.e. a one-dimensional simplicial complex) \u0393\nwith vertex set V and with the set of edges E one associates to it a\nright angled Artin group (RAAG) (also known as a graph group)\nG\u0393 = hv \u2208 V ; vw = wv\n\niff (v, w) \u2208 Ei,\n\nsee [6], [28]. In the case when \u0393 is a complete graph G\u0393 is a free\nabelian group of rank n = |V |; in the other extreme, when \u0393 has\nno edges the group G\u0393 is the free group of rank n. In general G\u0393\ninterpolates between the free and free abelian groups. In this paper we\nare interested in right angled Artin groups associated to random graphs\n\u0393. We adopt one of the basic Erd\u0151s - R\u00e9nyi models of random graphs\nin which each edge of the complete graph on n vertices is included\nwith probability 0 < p < 1 independently of all other edges. In other\nn\nwords, we consider the probability space \u03a9n of all 2( 2 ) subgraphs of\nthe complete graph on n vertices {1, 2, . . . , n} and the probability that\na specific graph \u0393 \u2208 \u03a9n appears as a result of a random process equals\n(1)\n\nP(\u0393) = pE\u0393 (1 \u2212 p)( 2 )\u2212E\u0393 ,\nn\n\nwhere E\u0393 denotes the number of edges of \u0393, see [21].\nIn Gromov's model a random group is given by a presentation with\nrandomly generated relations where each of the relations has a fixed\nlength l and the total number of relations is also fixed (and depends\non the density d), see above. In the case of random right angled Artin\ngroups one generates randomly relations of a special type (namely, the\ncommutation relations).\nIn this paper we examine statistics of various topological invariants of\nthe group G\u0393 associated to a random graph. Each of such invariants is\na random function and it is quite natural to ask about its mathematical\nexpectation and distribution function. We assume that n \u2192 \u221e and\nseek results of asymptotic nature.\nOur main effort is in finding the topological complexity TC(K\u0393 ) of\nthe Eilenberg-MacLane spaces K\u0393 associated to the right angled Artin\ngroup of a random graph \u0393. The spaces K\u0393 are closely related to the\nconfiguration spaces of braid groups of graphs (see [11]) which indicates the relevance of the results obtained here to collision free motion\n\n\f4\n\nARMINDO COSTA AND MICHAEL FARBER\n\nplanning of multiple particles on graphs. The notion of topological\ncomplexity TC(X) reflects the structure of motion planning algorithms\nfor systems having X as their configuration space, see a brief survey\nand further references in \u00a74. In general, TC(X) depends only on the homotopy type of X; however if X = K(G, 1) is an Eilenberg - MacLane\nspace then TC(X) depends only on the fundamental group G of X. In\nthis paper we show that the topological complexity TC(K\u0393 ), where \u0393 is\na random graph, can be determined almost precisely (with ambiguity\nat most two). We prove the following result:\nTheorem. Fix an arbitrary \u01eb > 0 and assume that the probability\nparameter 0 < p < 1 is constant (i.e. independent of n). Then for a\nrandom graph \u0393 \u2208 \u03a9n one has\n(2)\n\n2 * \u230az(n, p) \u2212 \u01eb\u230b + 1 \u2264 TC(K\u0393 ) \u2264 2 * \u230az(n, p) + \u01eb\u230b + 1,\n\nasymptotically almost surely, where\nz(n, p) = 2 logq n \u2212 2 logq logq n + 2 logq (e/2) + 1,\n\nq = p\u22121 .\n\nIn other words, probability that a graph \u0393 \u2208 \u03a9n does not satisfy inequality (2) tends to zero when n tends to infinity.\nA recent paper [7] continues investigation of properties of random\ngroups associated to random graphs initiated by the present article. It\nis shown in [7] that a random right angled Artin group has a finite outer\nautomorphism group if the probability parameter p is constant and lies\nin the interval (0.3, 1). Paper [7] also deals with a more general class\nof random groups associated to random graphs and gives a threshold\nfor hyperbolicity of these groups.\nThe authors thank Daniel Cohen for helpful discussions.\n2. Betti numbers of random graph groups\nFirst we remind the well-known construction of an aspherical complex K\u0393 with fundamental group G\u0393 . We refer to [6] and [28] for proofs\nand more detail.\nLet V = V\u0393 denote the set of vertices of the graph \u0393. The torus T n\nwhere n = |V | can be identified with the set of all functions \u03c6 : V \u2192 S 1 .\nThe support supp(\u03c6) \u2282 V of a function \u03c6 : V \u2192 S 1 is defined as the\nset of vertices v \u2208 V such that \u03c6(v) 6= 1. One defines K\u0393 \u2282 T n to\nbe the set of all functions \u03c6 such that their support supp(\u03c6) generates\na complete subgraph of \u0393, i.e. any two vertices of the support are\nconnected by an edge in \u0393. It is known [6], [28] that K\u0393 (viewed with\nthe induced topology) is aspherical and its fundamental group is \u0393.\n\n\fRANDOM GRAPH GROUPS\n\n5\n\nFix the cell decomposition of S 1 consisting of a 0-cell 1 \u2208 S 1 and\na 1-cell S 1 \u2212 {1}. Then T n inherits a cell decomposition with cells\nin one-to-one correspondence with subsets of V . In this decomposition\nK\u0393 \u2282 T n is a cell subcomplex; the cells of K\u0393 are in 1-1 correspondence\nwith complete subgraphs of \u0393. Namely, given a subset S \u2282 V one\nconsiders the set eS of all functions \u03c6 : V \u2192 S 1 with support equal S;\nclearly eS is a cell of dimension |S|.\nThe cohomology algebra of K\u0393 with integral coefficients is the quotient\n(3)\n\nH \u2217 (K\u0393 ; Z) \u2243 E(v1 , . . . , vn )/J\u0393\n\nwhere E(v1 , . . . , vn ) is the exterior algebra generated by degree one\nclasses corresponding to the vertices V = {v1 , . . . , vn } of \u0393 and the\nideal J\u0393 is generated by the degree two monomials vw such that the\ncorresponding vertices v, w are not connected by an edge.\nIn particular any product vi1 vi2 . . . vir vanishes iff the corresponding\nvertices {vi1 , vi2 , . . . , vir } do not form a complete subgraph of \u0393. The\nmonomials of the form vi1 vi2 . . . vir , with distinct vertices vi1 , vi2 , . . . , vir\nsuch that any two of them are connected by an edge in \u0393, form an\nadditive basis of H \u2217(K\u0393 ; Z). Thus, one obtains the following wellknown fact:\nLemma 1. For an integer r \u2265 2 the r-th Betti number2 br (G\u0393 ) =\nbr (K\u0393 ) equals the number of complete subgraphs of size r in \u0393.\nNote that b0 (G\u0393 ) = 1 and b1 (G\u0393 ) = n for any graph \u0393 on n vertices.\nLemma 2. The expectation of the r-th Betti number of the group G\u0393\nof a random graph \u0393, where r \u2265 2, equals\n\u0012 \u0013\nn (r2)\n(4)\np .\nE(br (G\u0393 )) =\nr\nProof. As explained above we must find the number of maximal complete subgraphs of size r in \u0393 \u2208 \u03a9n . For a subset S \u2282 {1, . . . , n} with\n|S| = r consider the random variable IS : \u03a9n \u2192 {0, 1} which equals\n1 on a graph \u0393 \u2208 \u03a9n iff S forms a complete subgraph in \u0393. Then\nP\nr\nE(IS ) = p(2) and S IS is the\nP number of all complete subgraphs on r\nvertices. This shows that E( S IS ) is as stated.\n\u0003\nNow we assume that r (the dimension) is fixed and p may depend\non n. Asymptotically, the expectation of br (G\u0393 ) can be written as\n2The\n\ndiscussion preceeding Lemma 1 shows that the cohomology H \u2217 (K\u0393 ; Z) is\nZ-torsion free. Thus the Betti numbers br (G\u0393 ) are independent of the field of\ncoefficients.\n\n\f6\n\nARMINDO COSTA AND MICHAEL FARBER\n\n1 h r\u22121 ir\n.\nnp 2\nr!\nThe expectation has a positive limit for n \u2192 \u221e if and only if\nE(br (G\u0393 )) \u223c\n\nnp\n\n(5)\n\nr\u22121\n2\n\n\u2192 c > 0.\n\ncr\nUnder this condition the expectation E(br (G\u0393 )) converges to .\nr!\nNote that the convergence (5) to a positive limit may happen for one\ndimension r only.\nMoreover, assuming (5), the distribution of br : \u03a9 \u2192 Z converges to\nthe Poisson distribution with expectation\ncr\n\u03bb= ,\n(6)\nr!\nsee below. Theorem 3 is a group theoretic interpretation (based on\nLemma 1) of a theorem of Sch\u00fcrger [31] about complete subgraphs in\nrandom graphs. More general results concerning the containment of a\nspecific graph in a random graph were established by by Bollob\u00e1s [5]\nand Karo\u0144ski and Ruci\u0144ski [23]; see Theorem 3.19 from [21].\nTheorem 3. Fix an integer r > 1 and consider the function of r-th\nBetti number of the associated graph group,\nbr : \u03a9n \u2192 Z,\n\nbr (\u0393) = br (G\u0393 ),\n\nas a random function of a random graph. If the limit (5) exists and is\npositive then for any integer k = 0, 1, . . . the probability\nP(br (G\u0393 ) = k)\nconverges (as n \u2192 \u221e) to\ne\u2212\u03bb *\n\n\u03bbk\nk!\n\nwhere \u03bb is given by formula (6).\nIn other words, Theorem 3 claims that the limiting distribution is\nPoisson with mean \u03bb.\nExample 4.

Cohomological dimension of random graph groups\nThe cohomological dimension of G\u0393 equals the size of the maximal\nclique in \u0393; this follows from the discussion of section 2. Recall that\na clique in a graph is defined as a maximal complete subgraph. The\nclique number cl(\u0393) of a graph \u0393 is the maximal order of a clique in \u0393.\nThere are many results in the literature about the clique number of\nrandom graphs; we may interpret these results as statements about the\ncohomological dimension of graph groups build out of random graphs.\nMatula [26], [27] discovered that for fixed values of p the distribution of\nthe clique number of a random graph is highly concentrated in the sense\nthat almost all random graphs have about the same clique number.\nThese results were developed further by Bollob\u00e1s and Erd\u0151s [3]; see\nthe monographs of B. Bollob\u00e1s [4] and of N. Alon and J. Spencer [1].\nBelow we restate a result of Matula [27] as a statement about cohomological dimension of random graph groups.\nDenote\n(7)\n\nz(n, p) = 2 logq n \u2212 2 logq logq n + 2 logq (e/2) + 1,\n\nwhere q = p\u22121 . We assume that p is independent of n, i.e. it is constant.\nTheorem 5. Fix an arbitrary \u01eb > 0. Then\n(8)\n\n\u230az(n, p) \u2212 \u01eb\u230b \u2264 cd(G\u0393 ) \u2264 \u230az(n, p) + \u01eb\u230b,\n\nasymptotically almost surely (a.a.s). In other words, the probability\nthat a graph \u0393 \u2208 \u03a9n does not satisfy inequality (8) tends to zero when\nn tends to infinity.\nHere \u230ax\u230b denotes the largest integer not exceeding x. We may assume\nthat \u01eb < 1/2; then the integers \u230az(n, p) \u2212 \u01eb\u230b and \u230az(n, p) + \u01eb\u230b either\ncoincide or differ by 1.\nThus, according Theorem 5, the cohomological dimension cd(G\u0393 ) for\na random graph \u0393 takes on one of at most two values depending on n\nand p, with probability approaching 1 as n \u2192 \u221e.\nNext Lemma is a technical result which will be used later in this\npaper. The Lemma shows in particular that the expected Betti number\nof K\u0393 in dimension r = \u230az(n, p) \u2212 \u01eb\u230b (nearly the highest dimension\nwhere homology is nonzero, according to Lemma 2 and Theorem 5)\ntends to infinity faster than r. Thus, significant amount of homology\nof K\u0393 is concentrated in the top dimension.\nLemma 6. Fix \u01eb > 0 and let r = \u230az(n, p) \u2212 \u01eb\u230b.

This completes the\nproof.\n\u0003\n4. Motion planning algorithms and the concept of\ntopological complexity\nGiven a mechanical system, a motion planning algorithm is a function which assigns to any pair of states of the system, an initial state\nand a desired state, a continuous motion of the system starting at the\ninitial state and ending at the desired state. The design of effective motion planning algorithms is one of the challenges of modern robotics, see\n[24]. Motion planning algorithms are applicable in various situations\nwhen the system is autonomous and operates in a fully or partially\nknown environment.\nThe complexity of motion planning algorithms is measured by a numerical invariant TC(X) which depends on the homotopy type of the\nconfiguration space X of the system [17]. This invariant is defined\nas the Schwarz genus (also known as the \"sectional category\") of the\npath-space fibration\n(9)\n\np : P X \u2192 X \u00d7 X.\n\nHere P X is the space of all continuous paths \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 X equipped\nwith the compact-open topology and p(\u03b3) = (\u03b3(0), \u03b3(1)) is the map\nassociating to a path \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 X its pair of endpoints. Explicitly,\n\n\fRANDOM GRAPH GROUPS\n\n9\n\nTC(X) is the smallest integer k such that X \u00d7 X admits an open cover\nU1 \u222a U2 \u222a * * * \u222a Uk = X \u00d7 X with the property that there exists a\ncontinuous section Ui \u2192 P X of (9) for each i = 1, . . . , k. If X is\nan Euclidean neighborhood retract then TC(X) can be equivalently\ncharacterized as the minimal integer k such that there exists a section\ns : X \u00d7 X \u2192 P X of the fibration p with the property that X \u00d7 X can\nbe represented as the union of k mutually disjoint locally compact sets\nX \u00d7 X = G1 \u222a * * * \u222a Gk\nsuch that the restriction s|Gi is continuous for i = 1, . . . , k, see [16],\nProposition 4.2. A section s as above represents a motion planning\nalgorithm: given a pair (A, B) \u2208 X \u00d7 X the image s(A, B) \u2208 P X is a\ncontinuous motion of the system starting at the state A and ending at\nthe state B.\nIntuitively, the topological complexity TC(X) can be understood as\na measure of the navigational complexity of the topological space X; it\nis the minimal number of continuous rules which are needed to describe\na motion planning algorithm in X.\nThe invariant TC(X) admits an upper bound in terms of the dimension of the configuration space X,\n(10)\n\nTC(X) \u2264 2 dim(X) + 1\n\nsee [17], Theorem 4. There are many examples when inequality (10)\nis sharp: take for instance X = T n \u266fT n , the connected sum of two\ncopies of a torus, having the topological complexity TC(X) = 2n + 1.\nHowever for any simply connected space X one has a more powerful\nupper bound\n(11)\n\nTC(X) \u2264 dim(X) + 1,\n\nsee [14]. The latter inequality is sharp for any simply connected closed\nsymplectic manifold X, see [15].\nThere are many other examples when the inequality (10) is not sharp.\nIt was established in [9] that for any finite cell complex X with \u03c01 (X) =\nZ2 one has\n(12)\n\nTC(X) \u2264 2 dim(X).\n\nFor example TC(RPn ) \u2264 2n for all n; moreover, TC(RPn ) = 2n if\nand only if n is a power of 2, see Corollary 14 of [15].\nThe main result of this paper states that the inequality (10) is asymptotically very close to equality in the case of Eilenberg - MacLane spaces\nof random graph groups.\n\n\f10\n\nARMINDO COSTA AND MICHAEL FARBER\n\n5. The topological complexity of random graph groups\nConsider the probability space \u03a9n of random graphs on n vertices\nwith probability given by formula (1). For any \u0393 \u2208 \u03a9n consider the\ncorresponding Eilenberg-MacLane complex K\u0393 (see \u00a72) and its topological complexity TC(K\u0393 ), as defined in the previous section. The\nprobability measure on \u03a9n is given by the formula (1).\nTheorem 7. Fix an arbitrary \u01eb > 0 and assume that the edge probability parameter 0 < p < 1 is constant (i.e. independent of n). Then\nfor any random graph \u0393 \u2208 \u03a9n one has\n(13) 2 * \u230az(n, p) \u2212 \u01eb\u230b + 1 \u2264 TC(K\u0393 ) \u2264 2 * \u230az(n, p) + \u01eb\u230b + 1,\nasymptotically almost surely. Here z(n, p) is given by formula (7).\nIt is clear that the integers on the left and on the right of inequality\n(13) differ at most by 2 (if \u01eb < 1/2). Hence Theorem 7 determines the\nvalue of the topological complexity TC(G\u0393 ) for a random graph with\nambiguity of at most 2. Comparing with the result of Theorem 5 we\nobtain\nCorollary 8.

To specify an (r, r) bi-clique one has to determine an relement subset S of the set of vertices of \u0393 and an r-element subset T\nin the complement V \u2212 S such that the induced graphs on S and T are\ncomplete.\nWe know from sections \u00a7\u00a72, 3 that cd(G\u0393 ) \u2265 r if \u0393 contains an rclique, i.e. a maximal complete subgraph on r vertices.

This action is transitive\non the four coordinates.\nRecall that our goal is to show that the sum (20) tends to 1 as\nn \u2192 \u221e. Note that\nX\n(26)\nF\u03b1 = 1\n\u03b1\u2208D\n\nfor obvious reasons.

Schematic representation of behavior of T\u03b1\nwith respect to small a \u2208 S\u03bb and large a \u2208 L\u03bb coordinates.\nLemma 10. There exists a constant N > 0 such that for all n \u2265 N the\nfollowing is true: Suppose that \u03b1\u2032 = (a + 1, b, c, d) \u2208 D is obtained from\n\u03b1 = (a, b, c, d) \u2208 D by adding 1 to one of its coordinates. If a \u2264 r/2\nand m(b, c) 6\u2208 S\u03bb , then\n(38)\n\nT\u03b1 > T\u03b1\u2032 .\n\nProof. Without loss of generality we may assume that a \u2208 I\u03bb since the\ncase a \u2208 S\u03bb is covered by Lemma 9. Then our assumptions imply that\nm(b, c) \u2208 I\u03bb , and therefore by symmetry we may assume that b \u2208 I\u03bb .\nOur goal is to estimate the value of A given by (35). We have\na + b > 2(1 \u2212 \u03bb) logq n\nand since r < 2 logq n we obtain\n(39)\n\nr \u2212 a \u2212 b < 2\u03bb logq n\n\nand thus the numerator in (35) satisfies\n(r \u2212 a \u2212 b)(r \u2212 a \u2212 c) < 4\u03bb log2q n.\nTo estimate the denominator we observe that a < r/2 implies\neq\nn\nqa \u2264\n*\n.\n2 logq n\nSince a + 1 \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u03bb) logq n we obtain\n(40) 2Aq a \u2264\n\n4\u03bb log2q n\neq\nn\n1\n4\u03bb\neq\n*\n*\n* =\n*\n< 1;\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb) logq n 2 logq n n\n1\u2212\u03bb 2\n\nthe last inequality uses our assumption (33). This completes the proof\nof statement (38).\n\u0003\n\n\fRANDOM GRAPH GROUPS\n\n17\n\nLemma 11. For n sufficiently large and \u03b1 = (a, 0, 0, d) \u2208 D with\n1 \u2264 a \u2264 r \u2212 1, one has\n(41)\n\nT\u03b1 \u2264 max{T(1,0,0,d) , T(r\u22121,0,0,d) }.\n\nProof. The assertion of the Lemma follows from Lemma 9 in the case\nwhen either a \u2208 S\u03bb or a \u2208 L\u03bb . Hence we may assume below that\n\u03b1 = (a, 0, 0, d) where a \u2208 I\u03bb .\nDenote \u03b1\u2032 = (a + 1, 0, 0, d) and \u03b1\u2032\u2032 = (a + 2, 0, 0, d). Then\n\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0013\nT\u03b1\u2032\u2032 T\u03b1\nn \u2212 4r + a + d + 1\nr\u2212a\u22121\na+1\n=\n*\n*\n* q.\n2\nT\u03b1\nr\u2212a\na+2\nn \u2212 4r + a + d + 2\nIn the RHS of this formula two bracketed factors tend to 1 as n \u2192 \u221e;\nbesides q > 1 . Hence for n > N large enough one has\nT\u03b1 T\u03b1\u2032\u2032\n> 1.\nT\u03b12\u2032\n\n(42)\n\nThis proves that logq (T\u03b1 ) is convex as function of a \u2208 I\u03bb . By Lemma\n9 this function increases for a \u2208 S\u03bb and decreases for a \u2208 L\u03bb . This\nimplies (41).\n\u0003\nNow we are able to completePthe proof of Theorem 7. Recall that\nwe have to show that the sum \u03b1\u2208D\u2032 T\u03b1 tends to 0 as n \u2192 \u221e where\nD \u2032 = D \u2212 {(0, 0, 0, 0)}. Consider the subset D\u0303 \u2282 D consisting of\nvectors with at least one coordinate equal r. Each \u03b1 \u2208 D\u0303 has the form\n\u03b1 = (r, 0, 0, d) (up to symmetry) where d = 0, . . . , r. Applying Lemma\n11 we obtain that\nT\u03b1 \u2264 max{T(r,0,0,0) , T(r,0,0,r) }.\nSince the cardinality of D\u0303 does not exceed 5r, we obtain, using (27)\nand (28), that\nX\n(43)\nT\u03b1 = o(1).\n\u03b1\u2208D\u0303\n\nEach vector \u03b1 \u2208 D may have at most two large coordinates. Decompose\nD \u2032 \u2212 D\u0303 = D0\u2032 \u222a D1\u2032 \u222a D2\u2032 ,\n\u2032\n\nwhere Di\u2032 denotes the set all vectors in D\u0303 having exactly i large coordinates, i = 0, 1, 2.\nSuppose that \u03b1 \u2208 D2\u2032 . Without loss of generality we may assume\nthat a and d are large and b and c are small, i.e. a, d \u2208 L\u03bb , b, c \u2208 S\u03bb .\n\n\f18\n\nARMINDO COSTA AND MICHAEL FARBER\n\nApplying Lemma 9 we obtain T\u03b1 \u2264 T(a,0,0,d) . Since a 6= r 6= d we may\nengage Lemma 11 to obtain\n(44)\n\nT\u03b1 \u2264 max{T(1,0,0,r\u22121) , T(r\u22121,0,0,r\u22121) }.\n\nNow, taking into account (27), (28) and (32), we obtain\nX\n(45)\nT\u03b1 = o(1).\n\u03b1\u2208D2\u2032\n\nP\nConsider now the sum\nIn this case the vector \u03b1 =\n\u03b1\u2208D1\u2032 T\u03b1 .\n(a, b, c, d) contains one large index. Assume that a is large. Then\nb, c must be small and applying Lemma 9 and Lemma 11 we obtain\nT\u03b1 \u2264 T(a,0,0,d) \u2264 T(r\u22121,0,0,d) \u2264 max{T(r\u22121,0,0,0) , T(r\u22121,0,0,r\u22121) }.\nNow (32) implies that\n(46)\n\nX\n\nT\u03b1 = o(1).\n\n\u03b1\u2208D1\u2032\n\nNext we show that for any \u03b1 \u2208 D0\u2032 one has\n(47)\n\nT\u03b1 \u2264 max{T(1,0,0,0) , T(r\u22121,0,0,0) , T(r\u22121,0,0,r\u22121) }\n\nwhich in view of (32) would imply that\nX\n(48)\nT\u03b1 = o(1).\n\u03b1\u2208D0\u2032\n\nThe combination of (43), (45), (46) and (48) give Theorem 7.\nTo prove (47) consider \u03b1 = (a, b, c, d) \u2208 D0\u2032 . Note that coordinates\na, b, c, d can be either small or intermediate. Assume first that all coordinates a, b, c, d are small. Then T\u03b1 \u2264 T(1,0,0,0) (by Lemma 9) implying\n(47).\nSuppose now that exactly one of the coordinates of \u03b1 is intermediate.\nIf a is intermediate and b, c, d are small then\nT\u03b1 \u2264 T(a,0,0,0) \u2264 max{T(1,0,0,0) , T(r\u22121,0,0,0) }\n(by Lemma 9 and Lemma 11) proving (47).\nSuppose now that two coordinates of \u03b1 are intermediate. Taking\ninto account symmetry (the action of G on D, see above), this case can\nbe subdivided into two subcases: (i) a and b are intermediate and (ii)\na and d are intermediate. In the subcase (i), since a + b \u2264 r, either\na \u2264 r/2, or b \u2264 r/2 and we may apply Lemma 10. Assuming that\na \u2264 r/2 we obtain\nT\u03b1 \u2264 T(0,b,0,0) \u2264 max{T(1,0,0,0) , T(r\u22121,0,0,0) },\n\n\fRANDOM GRAPH GROUPS\n\n19\n\nimplying (47). In the subcase (ii), we know that b, c are small hence\nT\u03b1 \u2264 T(a,0,0,d) and application of Lemma 11 gives (47).\nIn the remaining case when \u03b1 \u2208 D0\u2032 has three or four intermediate\nindices we know that at least two of these indices are \u2264 r/2 and by\nLemma 10 one has\nT\u03b1 \u2264 T\u03b1\u2032\nwhere \u03b1\u2032 is obtained from \u03b1 by replacing by zeros two coordinates which\nwere \u2264 r/2. To estimate T\u03b1\u2032 one applies Lemma 11 leading again to\n(47). This completes the proof of Theorem 7.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] N. Alon, J. Spencer, The probabilistic method.
