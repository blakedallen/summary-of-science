Browder\n\narXiv:hep-ex/0112026v1 19 Dec 2001\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii\nAbstract. I describe the recent measurement of the CP violating parameter sin 2\u03c61 = (0.99 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b1\n0.05) from the Belle experiment at KEK.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIn 1973, Kobayashi and Maskawa (KM) first proposed a model where CP violation is\nincorporated as an irreducible complex phase in the weak-interaction quark mixing matrix [1]. The idea was remarkable and daring because it required the existence of six\nquarks at a time when only the u, d and s quarks were known to exist, The subsequent\ndiscoveries of the c, b and t quarks, and the compatibility of the model with the CP violation observed in the neutral kaon system led to the incorporation of the KM mechanism\ninto the Standard Model, even though it had not been conclusively tested experimentally.\nIn 1981, Sanda, Bigi and Carter pointed out that a consequence of the KM model\nwas that large CP violating asymmetries could occur in certain decay modes of the\nB mesons.[2] These asymmetries may occur when a neutral B meson decays to a CP\neigenstate. In this case the amplitude for the direct decay interferes with that for the\nprocess where the B meson first mixes to a B meson that then decays to the CP eigenstate.\nThe unitarity of the CKM matrix implies that the existence of three measurable\nphases. In the \"Nihongo\" convention, these are denoted\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u2217 \u0011\n\u2217 \u0011\n\u2217 \u0011\nVcd Vcb\nVud Vub\nVcd Vcb\n\u03c61 \u2261 arg \u2212 Vtd V \u2217 , \u03c62 \u2261 arg \u2212 VtdV \u2217 , \u03c63 \u2261 arg \u2212 VudV \u2217 .\n(1)\ntb\n\ntb\n\nub\n\nwhile at SLAC these angles are usually referred to as \u03b2, \u03b1 and \u03b3, respectively.\nA non-zero value of \u03c6CP results in the time dependent asymmetry\nAf =\n\nR(B0 \u2192 fCP ) \u2212 R(B\u03040 \u2192 fCP )\n= \u03be f sin 2\u03c6CP * sin(\u2206m * (t2 \u00b1 t1 )),\nR(B0 \u2192 fCP ) + R(B\u03040 \u2192 fCP )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03be f is the CP eigenvalue (\u00b11), \u2206m denotes the mass difference between the two\nB0 mass eigenstates and t1 and t2 are the proper time for the tagged-B and CP eigenstate\ndecays, respectively. The + sign corresponds to the case where the B0 and B0 are in an\neven L orbital angular momentum state, the \u2212 sign obtains for odd L states such as the\n\u03a5(4S). A determination of A f thus provides a measurement of sin 2\u03c6CP .\nWe note that due to the restrictions of quantum mechanics, time integrated asymmetries at the \u03a5(4S) resonance (which corresponds to the \u2212 sign in the above equation)\nare identically zero. Therefore, one must make time dependent measurements. Since the\n\n\fpairs of B mesons are produced nearly at rest in the usual arrangement at threshold, the\n\u03a5(4S) center of mass frame must be boosted. This is accomplished by the use of beams\nwith asymmetric energies. For example at KEK-B, \u03b2\u03b3 \u223c 0.43, and as a result the typical\nB meson decay length is dilated from 20\u03bcm to about 200\u03bcm, which is measurable with\ndouble-sided silicon strip vertex detectors close to the interaction point.\nThe measurement therefore requires:\na large sample of reconstructed B \u2192 (cc)K 0 eigenstate decays;\n\u2022 a determination of the flavor of the accompanying B (\"tagging\");\n\u2022 a measurement of \u2206z, the vertex separation between the CP eigenstate and flavor\ntag decays; and\n\u2022 a fit to the flavor-tagged vertex distribution to extract sin 2\u03c61 .\n\u2022\n\nThe KEKB high luminosity double storage ring facility was commissioned with remarkable speed starting in late 1998. This accelerator facility allows us to satisfy the first\nrequirement. By the summer of 2001, 29.1 fb\u22121 was integrated on the \u03a5(4S). This data\nsample was used for the sin 2\u03c61 measurement and corresponds to 31.3 million BB\u0304 pairs.\nKEKB uses a \u00b111 mrad crossing angle to separate the incoming and outgoing beams\nand minimize parasitic collisions. So far no special limitations associated with the crossing angle have been observed (e.g. synchrobetatron oscillations). KEKB now routinely\nachieves peak instantaneous luminosities above 5 \u00d7 1033 /cm2 /sec with acceptable experimental backgrounds and trigger rates in the Belle detector. The beam currents are\nstill far below the design values and therefore there is room for further improvements in\nluminosity. Much larger data samples are expected in the near future.\nThe Belle detector has good lepton identification and high efficiency for both charged\nand neutral particles. It allows the CP eigenstate decays to be efficiently reconstructed.\nBelle is a large-solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a three-layer silicon\nvertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC), a mosaic of aerogel\nthreshold \u010cerenkov counters (ACC), time-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), and\nan array of CsI(Tl) crystals (ECL) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that\nprovides a 1.5 T magnetic field. An iron flux-return located outside of the coil is\ninstrumented to identify muons and KL 's (KLM). The detector is described in detail\nelsewhere [3]. Examples of its performance are given in the following section.\nThe Belle experiment starting physics data taking in 1999. In the summer of 2001,\nBelle (together with BABAR) announced the observation of the first statistically significant signals for CP violation outside of the kaon system. In this report I will describe\nsome of the details of the measurement.\n\nSIN 2\u03c61 MEASUREMENT\nWe reconstruct B0 decays to the following CP eigenstates [5]: J/\u03c8KS , \u03c8(2S)KS , \u03c7c1 KS ,\n\u03b7c KS for \u03be f = \u22121 and J/\u03c8KL for \u03be f = +1. We also use B0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u22170 decays where\nK \u22170 \u2192 KS \u03c00 . Here the final state is a mixture of even and odd CP, depending on the\nrelative orbital angular momentum of the J/\u03c8 and K \u22170 . The CP content is determined\nfrom a fit to the full angular distribution of all J/\u03c8K \u2217 decay modes other than K \u22170 \u2192\n\n\f250\n\nSum\n200\n\nJ/\u03c8 Ks(\u03c0+\u03c0-)\nJ/\u03c8 Ks(\u03c0 \u03c0 )\n0 0\n\n,\n\n2\n\nEvents/(2 MeV/c )\n\n\u03c8 KS\n\n150\n\n\u03c7c1 Ks\n\u03b7c Ks\nJ/\u03c8 K*\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n5.200\n\n5.225\n5.250\n5.275\n2\nBeam Constrained Mass (Gev/c )\n\n5.300\n\nFIGURE 1.

The signal region is the range 5.27 \u2212 5.29 GeV/c2 .\n\nKS \u03c00 . We find that the final state is primarily \u03be f = +1; the \u03be f = \u22121 fraction is 0.19 \u00b1\n0.04(stat) \u00b1 0.04(syst) [9].\nJ/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) mesons are reconstructed via their decays to l+ l\u2212 (l = \u03bc, e). The\n\u03c8(2S) is also reconstructed via J/\u03c8\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212, and the \u03c7c1 via J/\u03c8\u03b3. The \u03b7c is detected in\nthe K + K \u2212 \u03c00 and KS K \u2212 \u03c0+ modes. For the J/\u03c8KS mode, we use KS \u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 and \u03c00 \u03c00\ndecays; for other modes we only use KS \u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 .\nThe J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 candidates are reconstructed from oppositely charged\ntrack pairs where at least one track is positively identified as a muon by the KLM system\nand the other is either positively identified as a muon or has an ECL energy deposit\nconsistent with that of a minimum ionizing particle. For e+ e\u2212 decays, we use oppositely\ncharged track pairs where at least one track is a well identified electron and the other\ntrack satisfies minimal dE/dx and E/p requirements. For dielectrons, we correct for\nfinal state radiation or bremsstrahlung and recover additional \u03c8 candidates by including\nthe four-momentum of every photon detected within 0.05 radians of the original e+ or\ne\u2212 direction in the e+ e\u2212 invariant mass calculation. Candidate KS \u2192 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 decays are\noppositely charged track pairs that have an invariant mass between 482 and 514 MeV/c2 ,\nwhich corresponds to \u00b13\u03c3 around the KS mass peak.\nTo reconstruct \u03c7c1 KS decays, we select \u03c7c1 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b3 decays, rejecting \u03b3's that are\nconsistent with \u03c00 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays, and impose the requirement 385 < M\u03b3ll \u2212 Mll <\n430.5 MeV/c2 . For \u03b7c decays, we distinguish kaons from pions using a combination\nof CDC dE/dx measurements and information from the TOF and ACC systems. Candidate \u03b7c \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c00 (KS K \u2212 \u03c0+ ) decays are selected with a KK\u03c0 mass requirement that\ntakes into account the natural width of the \u03b7c . For J/\u03c8K \u22170 (KS \u03c00 ) decays, we use KS \u03c00\ncombinations that have an invariant mass within 75 MeV/c2 of the nominal K \u2217 mass.\nWe reduce background from low-momentum \u03c00 's by requiring cos \u03b8K \u2217 < 0.8, where \u03b8K \u2217\nis the angle between the KS momentum vector and the K \u22170 flight direction calculated in\nthe K \u22170 rest frame.\n\n\fTABLE 1.

Table 1 lists the numbers of observed candidates (Nev )\nand the background (Nbkgd ) determined by extrapolating the rate from the \u2206E vs. Mbc\nsideband region into the signal region. About 65% of the exclusive CP signal events\n(44% of the full CP sample) are reconstructd in the B0 \u2192 \u03c8KS , KS \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 mode.\nCandidate B0 \u2192 J/\u03c8KL decays are selected by requiring ECL and/or KLM hit patterns that are consistent with the presence of a shower induced by a neutral hadron. KL\ncandidates with ECL information only are treated separately from the KL candidates\nwith KLM hits. The centroid of the shower is required to be within a 45\u25e6 cone centered\non the KL direction that is inferred from two-body decay kinematics and the measured\nfour-momentum of the J/\u03c8. To reduce the background we cut on a likelihood ratio that\ndepends on the J/\u03c8 cms momentum, the angle between the KL and its nearest-neighbor\ncharged track, the charged track multiplicity of the event, the extent to which the event is\nconsistent with a B+ \u2192 J/\u03c8K \u2217+ (KL \u03c0+) hypothesis, and the polar angle with respect to\nthe z direction of the reconstructed B0 meson in the cms. In addition, events that were reconstructed as B0 \u2192 J/\u03c8KS , J/\u03c8K \u22170 (K + \u03c0\u2212, KS \u03c00 ), B+ \u2192 J/\u03c8K + , or J/\u03c8K \u2217+ (K +\u03c00 ,\nKS \u03c0+ ) decays are removed. Finally, KL clusters with positions that match photons from\nreconstructed \u03c00 's are also rejected.\nFigure 2 shows the pcms\ndistribution, calculated with the B0 \u2192 J/\u03c8KL two-body\nB\ndecay hypothesis. The histograms are the results of a fit to the signal and background\ndistributions. The shapes are derived from the Belle GEANT based Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulation. However, the normalization and peak position of the signal are allowed to\nvary. There are 397 entries in the 0.2 \u2264 pcms\nB \u2264 0.45 GeV/c signal region with KLM\nclusters. There are 172 entries in the range 0.2 \u2264 pcms\nB \u2264 0.40 GeV/c with clusters in\nthe ECL only. The fit finds a total of 346 \u00b1 29 J/\u03c8KL signal events, and a signal purity\n\n\fof 61%.

The signal region for KLM (ECL-only)\nclusters is 0.2 \u2264 pcms\nB \u2264 0.45(0.40) GeV/c.\n\nTo identify the flavor of the accompanying B meson, leptons, kaons, \u039b's, charged\nslow pions from D\u2217 \u2192 D0 \u03c0+ decays, and energetic pions from two-body B decay\n(e.g. B \u03040 \u2192 D\u2217+ \u03c0+ ) are used. A likelihood based method, described in detail below,\nis used to combine information from the different categories and to take into account\ntheir correlations. The figure of merit for flavor tagging performance is the effective\nefficiency, \u03b5e f f , which is \u03b5(1 \u2212 2w2) summed over all tagging categories. This method\ngives \u03b5e f f = 0.270 \u00b1 0.008+0.006\n\u22120.009 .\nA Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine a table for a category-dependent\nvariable that indicates whether a particle originates from a B0 or B0 . The values of\nthis variable range from \u22121 for a reliably identified B0 to +1 for a reliably identified\nB0 and depend on the tagging particle's charge, cm momentum, polar angle, particleidentification probability, as well as other kinematic and event shape quantities. For\nlepton tags, the missing momentum and recoil momentum are included in the likelihood\ndetermination. For slow pion tags, the angle between the pion and the thrust axis of\nthe non- fCP tracks is used. Charged kaon tags accompanied by KS mesons, which have\nadditional strange quark content and a lower tagging value, are treated as a separate\ntagging category.\nThe results from the separate, particle-level categories are then combined in a second\nstage that takes correlations for the case of multiple particle-level tags into account.\nThis second stage determines two event-level parameters, q and r. The first, q, has the\ndiscrete values q = +1 when the tagged B meson is more likely to be a B0 and \u22121 when\nit is more likely to be a B0 . The parameter r is an event-by-event flavor-tagging dilution\nfactor that ranges from r = 0 for no flavor discrimination to r = 1 for unambiguous flavor\nassignment. The value of r is used only to sort data into six intervals of flavor purity; the\nwrong-tag probabilities that are used in the final CP fit are determined from data.\n\n\fTABLE 2.

The exclusive decay and tag vertices are reconstructed using\nthe same vertexing algorithm that is used in the CP fit. The values of wl are obtained from\nthe amplitudes of the time-dependent B0 B0 mixing oscillations: (NOF \u2212 NSF )/(NOF +\nNSF ) = (1 \u2212 2wl ) cos(\u2206md \u2206t). Here NOF and NSF are the numbers of opposite flavor and\nsame flavor events. The value of \u2206md is fixed at the world average [6]. Table 2 lists the\nresulting wl values together with the fraction of the events ( fl ) in each r interval.\nThe fCP vertex is determined using lepton tracks from J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(2S) decays, or prompt\ntracks from \u03b7c decays. The ftag vertex is determined from well reconstructed tracks not\nassigned to fCP . Tracks that form a KS are not used. The tracks used for vertexing must\nhave at least one three dimensional point with consistent hits in r \u2212 \u03c6 plus at least one\nadditional z hit. Each vertex position is required to be consistent with the interaction\npoint profile smeared in the r-\u03c6 plane by the B meson decay length. We use an iterative\n\n\fTABLE 3.

The typical vertex-finding efficiency and vertex\nresolution (rms) for zCP (ztag ) are 92 (91)% and 75 (140) \u03bcm, respectively. Note that\nthe resolution on the tag side includes a large additional contribution from charm decay.\nOnce the tag and CP eigenstate vertices are reconstructed, the proper time is calculated\nfrom \u2206z/\u03b3\u03b2.\nAfter vertexing there are 560 events with q = +1 flavor tags and 577 events with\nq = \u22121. Figure 3 shows the observed \u2206t distributions for the q\u03be f = +1 (solid points)\nand q\u03be f = \u22121 (open points) event samples. In the raw data there is a clear asymmetry\nbetween the two distributions; this demonstrates visually that CP symmetry is violated.\nTo extract the measured value of the CP violating parameter, we perform an unbinned\nmaximum likelihood fit to the time distributions of the tagged and vertexed events. The\nfit takes into account the effects of background, vertex resolutions and incorrect tagging.\nFor modes other than J/\u03c8K \u22170 the pdf expected for the signal is\n\nPsig (\u2206t, q, wl , \u03be f )\n=\n\n\u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4 0\nB\n\ne\n\n2\u03c4B0\n\n{1 \u2212 \u03be f q(1 \u2212 2wl ) sin 2\u03c61 sin(\u2206md \u2206t)},\n\nwhere we fix \u03c4B0 and \u2206md at their world average values [6]. For the B0 \u2192 \u03c8K \u22170 mode a\nmore complex fit to \u2206t and the transversity angle[8] is used to take into account the two\nCP eigenstates which contribute[9].\nThe pdf used for the background distribution is Pbkg (\u2206t) = f\u03c4 e\u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4bkg /2\u03c4bkg + (1 \u2212\nf\u03c4 )\u03b4(\u2206t), where f\u03c4 is the fraction of the background component with an effective lifetime\n\u03c4bkg and \u03b4 is the Dirac delta function. For all fCP modes other than J/\u03c8KL , a study using\nevents in the \u2206E vs. Mbc sideband regions shows that the f\u03c4 component is negligible. For\nthese modes we use Pbkg (\u2206t) = \u03b4(\u2206t).\nIn the case of B0 \u2192 \u03c8KL , the background is dominated by B \u2192 \u03c8X decays where some\nfinal states are CP eigenstates. We estimate the fractions of the background components\nwith and without a true KL cluster by fitting the pcm\nB distribution to the expected shapes\ndetermined from MC. We also use the MC to determine the fraction of events with\ndefinite CP content within each component. The result is a background that is 71%\nfrom non-CP modes with \u03c4bkg = \u03c4B . For the CP-mode backgrounds, we use the signal\npdf given above with the appropriate \u03be f values. For \u03c8K \u2217 (KL \u03c00 ), which is 13% of the\nbackground, we use the \u03be f = \u22121 content determined from the full \u03c8K \u2217 sample. The\n\n\fFIGURE 4. The proper decay time distributions for B0 \u2192 D(\u2217)\u2212 \u03c0+ decays. The upper curve is the result\nof the fit for the B0 lifetime; the lower curve represents the background contribution.\n\nremaining backgrounds are \u03be f = \u22121 states (10%) including \u03c8KS , and \u03be f = +1 states\n(5%) including \u03c8(2S)KL , \u03c7c1 KL and \u03c8\u03c00 .\nThe last ingredient needed for the CP fit is the proper-time interval resolution, R(\u2206t).\nThis resolution function is parameterized by convolving a sum of two Gaussians (a\nmain component due to the SVD vertex resolution and charmed meson lifetimes, plus\na tail component caused by poorly reconstructed tracks) with a function that takes into\naccount the cm motion of the B mesons. The relative fraction of the main Gaussian is\ndetermined to be 0.97 \u00b1 0.02 from a study of B0 \u2192 D\u2217\u2212 \u03c0+ , D\u2217\u2212 \u03c1+ , D\u2212 \u03c0+ , \u03c8K \u22170 , \u03c8KS\nand B+ \u2192 D0 \u03c0+ , \u03c8K + events. The means (\u03bcmain , \u03bctail ) and widths (\u03c3main , \u03c3tail ) of the\nGaussians are calculated event-by-event from the fCP and ftag vertex-fit error matrices\nand the \u03c72 values of the fit; typical values are \u03bcmain = \u22120.24 ps, \u03bctail = 0.18 ps and\n\u03c3main = 1.49 ps, \u03c3tail = 3.85 ps. An example of a fit for hadronic non-CP eigenstate\nusing the resolution function modes is shown in Fig. 4. The fit agrees well with data out\nto 10 lifetimes on the logarithmic scale of the figure. As a consistency check, we obtain\nlifetimes for the neutral and charged B mesons using the same vertexing procedure that\nis used for the CP fit. The results of the fit agree well with the world average B0 lifetime\nvalue.[7]\nThe pdfs for signal and background are convolved with R(\u2206t) to determine the\nlikelihood value for each event as a function of sin 2\u03c61 :\n\nLi =\n\nZ\n\n{ fsig Psig (\u2206t \u2032, q, wl , \u03be f )Rsig(\u2206t \u2212 \u2206t \u2032 )\n\n+(1 \u2212 fsig )Pbkg (\u2206t \u2032)Rbkg (\u2206t \u2212 \u2206t \u2032 )}d\u2206t \u2032,\nwhere fsig is the probability that the event is signal.

The smooth curve is the result of\nthe global unbinned fit. Figures 5(b) and (c) show the corresponding asymmetry displays\nfor the (cc\u0304)KS (\u03be f = \u22121) and the J/\u03c8KL (\u03be f = +1) modes separately. The observed\nasymmetries for the different CP states are indeed opposite, as expected. The curves are\nthe results of unbinned fits applied separately to the two samples; the resultant sin 2\u03c61\nvalues are 0.84 \u00b1 0.17(stat) and 1.31 \u00b1 0.23(stat), respectively.\nThe systematic error is dominated by uncertainties in the tails of the vertex distributions, which contribute 0.04. Other significant contributions come from uncertainties (a)\n\n\fin wl (0.03); (b) in the parameters of the resolution function (0.02); and (c) in the J/\u03c8KL\nbackground fraction (0.02). The errors introduced by uncertainties in \u2206md and \u03c4B0 are\nnegligible.\nA number of checks on the measurement were performed. Table 3 lists the results\nobtained by applying the same analysis to various subsamples. All values are statistically\nconsistent with each other. The result is unchanged if we use the wl 's determined\nseparately for ftag = B0 and B0 .

The asymmetry distribution for this control sample is shown in\nFig. 5(d).\nA single consistent reconstruction and analysis procedure is used for all data samples.\nWe verify that, as expected, the sin 2\u03c61 values for the different run periods are consistent.\nWith toy Monte Carlo studies we also verify that the analysis procedure and the errors in\nthe analysis are well behaved when sin 2\u03c61 is close to the physical boundary. As a further\ncheck, we used three independent CP fitting programs and two different algorithms for\nthe ftag vertexing and found no discrepancy.\nFinally, we comment on the possibility of direct CP violation. The signal pdf for a\nneutral B meson decaying into a CP eigenstate can be expressed in the more general\nform\n\nPsig (\u2206t) =\n\n1 \u2212 |\u03bb|2\n1 + |\u03bb|2\ne\u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4B0\n+q(1\u22122w\n)[\u03be\nIm\u03bb\nsin(\u2206m\n\u2206t)\u2212\ncos(\u2206md \u2206t)]}\n{\nf\nl\nd\n2\u03c4B0 (1 + |\u03bb|2)\n2\n2\n0\n\nwhere \u03bb is a complex parameter that depends on both B0 B mixing and on the amplitudes\n0\nfor B0 and B decay to a CP eigenstate. The presence of a cosine term (|\u03bb| =\n6 1) indicates\ndirect CP violation. For the primary analysis, we assumed |\u03bb| = 1 which is the SM\nexpectation. In order to test this assumption, we also performed a fit using the above\nexpression with Im\u03bb (= \"sin 2\u03c61 \") and |\u03bb| as free parameters. We obtain |\u03bb| = 1.03\u00b10.09\nand Im\u03bb = 0.99 \u00b1 0.14 for all CP modes combined, where the errors are statistical only.\nThis result confirms the assumption used in our analysis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the summer of 2001, Belle (along with BABAR) presented its first significant measurement of the CP violating parameter sin 2\u03c61 . BELLE found\nsin 2\u03c61 = 0.99 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b1 0.06\nwith a statistical significance of greater than six standard deviations[10]. This can be\ncompared to the BABAR result of sin 2\u03c61 = 0.59 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b1 0.05[11]. The two results are\nbased on data samples of comparable size (31 million and 32 million BB\u0304 pairs, respectively). The efficiencies and resolutions of the two experiments are also quite similar.\nHowever, although the weighted average of the two results agrees well with indirect\ndeterminations that assume the Standard Model, the two measurements themselves are\n\n\fonly marginally consistent. Larger data samples and additional more precise measurements will be required to fully reconcile these two results for sin 2\u03c61 . In parallel, a program for the measurement of the other angles, \u03c62 and \u03c63 , has started.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI wish to acknowledge the extraordinary achievement of my colleagues on Belle and the\nheroic effort of the KEKB accelerator team.
