The first studies were able to describe\nand explain their topology by showing that different thermodynamical quantities\nare needed to characterize a particular network, such as its degree distribution\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], community structures [6, 7], resilience [8] and motifs [9]. Recent efforts have also studied quantities spreading on complex networks, such as\ncomputer viruses [10, 11, 12, 13, 14] in technological networks and information\nin their social counterpart [15].\nOn the other hand, state dynamics has been studied disguised as opinion\nformation processes, which have been modelled using approaches including cellular automata [16], spin chains [17, 18] and opinion drifts over a continuous\nopinion space [19], without incorporating topology. Recently, network topology\nhas become more relevant and computer simulations have been performed in\nthis direction [20, 21, 22], though a systematic way to evaluate the topological\n\n1\n\n\feffects on the dynamical processes taking place on networks is still missing.\nIn this paper we study the effects of topology on a copy mechanism taking\nplace over a network with a non-trivial topology and an arbitrary number of\nstates. To achieve this, we group agents with similar topological characteristics\nand study the density of the evolving quantities over these groups by considering\nthe interactions among them.\nWe will first introduce the model together with its associated notation and then\nsolve it analytically. We will then study how network topology affects the simple dynamical process introduced below and show that the system arrives to a\nconfiguration in which the distribution of states is independent of the degree.\n\n2\n\nThe Model\n\nWe consider a process in which at each time step an agent changes its state by\ncopying one randomly from one of its immediate neighbors. The probability\nthat this occurs is the product between the probability that the agent is chosen,\ntimes the fraction of neighbors in a given state, including the agent, that are acquainted by it. We will consider a directed network with an adjustable topology\nas the substrate in which these dynamical processes will occur, and attempt to\ncharacterize the influence of topology upon them. We assume that changes in\nthe network topology take place at larger timescales than the relaxation times\nof the system.\n\n2.1\n\nDefinitions\n\nWe begin by grouping agents according to their degree into aggregates we call\nguilds. This reduces the problem to one as big as the number of guilds used to\ncalculate the approximation, this depends on the desired degree resolution, but\nit is always considerable smaller than the number of agents. Agents in a specific\nguild can be in any of the available states. We introduce the density \u03c1i\u03b1 as the\nnumber of agents in the ith guild which pertain to theP\n\u03b1 state, over the number\nof agents in the network. We define guild size \u03c1i = \u03b1 \u03c1i\u03b1 as the fraction of\nagents constituting that guild and fractional abundance\nP as the fraction of agents\non a particular state in the entire network \u03c1\u03b1 = i \u03c1i\u03b1 . From now on, latin\nindices will refer to guilds, while greek indices will label states.\nWe assume that the linking patterns of agents in the same guild are similar.\nIn other words, we will model a network in which agents from the same guild\nare linked to a similar number of agents in other guilds, although not necessarily\nthe same. This motivates us to introduce Pij as the probability that an agent\nin the ith guild is linked to an agent in the j th guild. We will refer to these\nquantities as linking probabilities and say that someone is linked to someone else\nif the linking agent has a personal or media based knowledge of the linked one.\nAn example is shown in figure (1). Three equal size guilds are clearly distin-\n\n2\n\n\f2\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\nFigure 1: Undirected network with eleven nodes in which 3 guilds are distinguishable. Nodes carry guilds as its labels, the first guild has 5 agents with a\ndegree equal to 2. The second guild is formed by 2 agents with a degree equal\nto 4. The third guild is formed by 4 agents with a degree equal to 1.\n\nguishable and acquaintanceship probabilities\n\uf8eb\n2/5 1/5\nP = \uf8ed 1/5 1\n0 1/2\n\n2.2\n\nare given by\n\uf8f6\n0\n1/2 \uf8f8 .\n0\n\nTopologically Considerate Mean-Field Approach\n\nIn the large network limit the rate of change for a state in a given guild is equal\nto the difference between the probabilities of wining and losing an agent. The\nprobability that an agent in the ith guild turns into the \u03b1th state is\nX\nX\nPij \u03c1j\u03b1\n\u03c1i\u03bc\n\u03a0+\ni\u03b1 =\n\n\u03bc6=\u03b1\n\nj\n\nX\n\n,\n\nPij \u03c1j\u03bc\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bc,j\n\nwhile the probability that an agent in the ith guild and the \u03b1th state changes\nits state to a diffrenet one is\nX\n\u03c1i\u03b1\nPij \u03c1j\u03bc\n\u03a0\u2212\ni\u03b1 =\n\n\u03bc6=\u03b1,j\n\nX\n\nPij \u03c1j\u03bc\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bc,j\n\nWe simplify the notation introducing \u03a5 as the matrix representing the expected fraction of agents in a particular state known by an agent in a particular\nguild on the entire network,\nX\nPij \u03c1j\u03b1 .\n(3)\n\u03a5i\u03b1 =\nj\n\n3\n\n\fCombining eqns. (1), (2) and (3) we can write the temporal variation of\nstate abundance for a given guild as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\nX\n1\n\u2202t \u03c1i\u03b1 =\n\u03a5i\u03b1\n\u03c1i\u03bc \u2212 \u03c1i\u03b1\n\u03a5i\u03bc ,\n(4)\n\u03a5i\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nP\nth\nwhere \u03a5i =\n\u03bc \u03a5i\u03bc represents the fraction of agents acquainted by the i\nguild1 . The extension of the restricted sums in equations (1) and (2) to include\nall states has no effect on the system dynamics because the additional terms\ncancel out when we place them on eqn. (4). Time units represent the network's\nnatural update time, which is the number of time steps equal to the population\nsize in a random or sequential updating processes.\n\n2.3\n\nAnalytical Solution\n\nAn analytical solution can be obtained by re-writing eqn. (4) and performing\nthe substitution \u03c1i\u03b1 = Ui\u03b1 e\u2212t . This transforms eqn. (4) into an eigenvalue\nequation for the vector U~\u03b1 = (U1\u03b1 , U2\u03b1 , * * *). The problem then reduces to\nfinding the solution of\n(5)\n\u2202t U~\u03b1 = M U~\u03b1 ,\n\u03c1i\nPij . From eqn. (5) it follows that the eigenfunctions of M\nwhere Mij = \u03a5\ni\ndepend exponentially on time with a decay rate \u03bb, where \u03bb is the associated\neigenvalue, this agrees with the results presented in [25, 26]. A general solution\ncan be written in terms of this basis as\nX \u03b7 \u03b7\n\u03c1i\u03b1 =\nCi\u03b1 Vi e(\u03bb\u03b7 \u22121)t ,\n(6)\n\u03b7\n\nin which Vi\u03b7 is the ith element of the \u03b7 th eigenvector of the matrix M and \u03bb\u03b7 is\nits associated eigenvalue. It is important to notice that M does not depend on\nthe state, implying that the state dependence is introduced through the initial\n\u03b7\nconditions only, represented by Ci\u03b1\n.\n\n2.3.1\n\nSystem Equilibria\n\nThe steady states are characterized by the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue \u03bb = 1. By direct calculation one can show that M always has an eigenvalue\nequal to 1 associated with guild sizes as its eigenvector. One has\nX\nj\n\nMij \u03c1j =\n\nX \u03c1i Pij \u03c1j\nj\n\n\u03a5i\n\n= \u03c1i\n\nX Pij \u03c1j\nj\n\n\u03a5i\n\n= \u03c1i .\n\n1 From now on we will assume that quantities with a missing index have been added over\nP\n\u03c1\nit, for example: \u03c1\u03b1 =\ni i\u03b1\n\n4\n\n\fWe have observed numerically that the remaining eigenvalues have a real part\nsmaller than 1 and lie inside the unit circle of the complex plane, a formal\ndemonstration of this remains open.\nThe mean-field approach presented above was compared with a stochastic\nsimulation on a 1000 agents network in which two equal size guilds were distinguishable (fig. (2)). The acquaintanceship probabilities were chosen such that\nall agents acquainted everyone in their respective guild, while the ones in the\nfirst guild acquainted an average of 3/5 of the agents in the second guild. On\nthe contrary, agents in the second guild acquainted 1/5 of the agents in the first\none. The simulation shows how accurate the mean field model is and reveals\nthat the standard deviation tends to stabilize as the system relaxes to equilibrium.\n\nFractional Abundance\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0\n\n2.5\n\n5\n7.5\nDiscrete Time\n\n10\n\nFigure 2: The continuous line represents the mean-field solution of a two guild\nnetwork with 1000 agents, while circles represent an average of 50 stochastic\nsimulations. Error bars indicate one standard deviation. In each simulation the\nnetwork was chosen randomly constrained to satisfy the conditions presented in\nthe text.\n\n3\n\nDegree Distribution\n\nWe define the in degree of an agent pertaining to a specific guild as the fraction\nof agents in the total sample that it knows. It, therefore represents the fraction\nof the network exerting a direct influence on it. On the other hand, an agent's\nout degree is the fraction of the entire network that knows the agent, these are\nthe ones directly influenced by it. This definition of degree implies that peer\ninfluence flows opposite to acquaintanceship. According to this, the in and out\n\n5\n\n\fdegree's in our model are represented by\nX\nPij \u03c1j = N \u03a5i ,\nkiin = N\n\nkiout = N\n\nX\n\nPji \u03c1j ,\n\n(7)\n\nj\n\nj\n\nthus degree distribution can be imposed by considering that the fraction of\nagents with the described degree is equal to guild size \u03c1i . We can approach a\ncomplex network with an out degree distribution satisfying a function f by the\nsolutions of\n\u0013\n\u0012 X\n(8)\nPji \u03c1j\n\u03c1i = f N\nj\n\nIn the case of scale-free networks eqn. (8) becomes\n\u03c1i =\n\n\u0012X\n\nPji \u03c1j\n\nj\n\n\u0013\u2212\u03b3\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere constant factors like normalization or network size have been absorbed\nby the elements of P , noting that equation (4) is zero degree homogeneous in\nP . For the case of a random network, degree distribution has an exponential\ntail that can be approximated by the solutions of\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\n\u03c1i = A exp \u2212 \u03b7\nPji \u03c1j\n(10)\nj\n\nas parameters. Here \u03b7 characterizes the rate of exponential decay and A is a\nnormalization factor.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nGuild Influence\nScale-Free Networks\n\nTo capture the influence exerted by the topology on the dynamical process, we\ndefine guild influence Ii as the equilibrium fractional abundance that a state\nwill achieve assuming that it was initially occupying, only and entirely, the ith\nguild (\u03c1\u03b1 (t = 0) = \u03c1i ),\n\u03c1\u03b1 (t)\nIi = lim\n.\nt\u2192\u221e \u03c1i\nThis quantity represents the average number of copies that an agent of a\ngiven guild creates during the entire process, or an effective infection rate proper\nof the guild. This is a formalization of what Wu et. al.[25] and Sucheki et. al.[25]\nhave done. Influence measures the affect of the group of agents with a certain\ndegree, generalizing the bias depicted in the two state systems studied by them.\nWe studied guild influence on a scale-free network by choosing guild sizes\nand finding acquaintanceships probabilities for a given scale-free exponent according to eqn. (9).

(4). From top to bottom,\nguild sizes were chosen as 9 \u00d7 10\u22121 , 9 \u00d7 10\u22122 , 9 \u00d7 10\u22123 , 9 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and 9 \u00d7\n10\u22125 . (B)Influence structure of a random network against the inverse of its\ncharacteristic length \u03b7, for a 10 guild network. From top to bottom guild sizes\nwere chosen as 0.026, 0.032, 0.041, 0.053, 0.068, 0.088, 0.114, 0.147, 0.189 and\n0.245. (C) Influence for a ten guild network in which each guild had a particular\nclustering coefficient. Different lines represent linearly spaced variations of the\nconstant a in the 0.01-0.09 interval from lowest to highest slope respectively.\nThe constant b was taken as 0.1 and 10 guilds were used. (D) Characteristic\ntimes against inter-guild connectivity for values of b chosen linearly spaced from\ntop to bottom in the 0.1-0.01 interval\n\nguild increases with decreasing \u03b3, until it reaches a steady value which is equal\nto the ratio between the system size and the number of agents in the highest\ndegree guild. This is a consequence of the increasing fame of the highest degree\nguild that occurs for small values of \u03b3. In the large exponent limit the influence\nof all guilds approach unity, meaning that there are no high out degree agents\nexerting an important influence on the system.\n\n4.1.1\n\nExponential Networks\n\nAn example involving a exponential network approximated by 10 guilds is shown\nin fig. (3B), the procedure used to determine the parameters being analogous to\nthe one performed for the scale-free network. The figure shows that in a random\nnetwork high degree guilds exert a mild influence compared to that occurring\non its scale-free counterpart. This is a consequence of the reduced population\nof high degree guilds.\n7\n\n\f4.2\n\nClustering\n\nThe topological influence of clustering was studied by choosing acquaintanceship\nprobabilities as\nPij = a + \u03b4ij (b * i \u2212 a) with b > a\nand equal guild sizes for all the network, where \u03b4ij is the Kronecker delta. This\nmodel represents a random network in which agents of the ith guild have a probability a of being acquainted to agents in other guilds. As usual, we shall call\nthis connectivity. On the contrary, the probability b*i to acquaint someone from\nits own guild together with the condition b > a defines clustered groups with\nan internal connectivity that increases linearly throughout the network. This is\nsimilar to communities in the sense introduced by Newman and Girvan[7, 23]\nand are also similar to the networks studied by Watts[24] at the end of last\ncentury . A particular case of this networks is the one shown in figure (1).\nIn a random network, clustering is equal to the probability that two agents\nare acquainted, motivating us to define guild clustering as the clustering coefficient of a guild in the absence of the rest of the network. We studied the\ndependence of influence on guild clustering (fig. (3C)) finding that there is a\nlinear dependence with a slope that decreases with a, meaning that the reinforcement mechanism is more effective in sparsely connected networks than in\nstrongly connected ones. Either way, the effect continues to remain mild compared to its scale-free counterpart. On the other hand, the characteristic time\nT required for the system to converge increases with decreasing a as T \u223c a\u2212\u03ba(b)\nwith d\u03ba/db < 0 (see Fig. 3D).\n\n5\n\nEquilibrium Distribution\n\nUsing the formalism recently introduced we can also find how states are distributed when the network reaches equilibria. In order to do this, first we notice\nthat eqn.(4) vanishes when\n\u03c1i\u03b1\n\u03a5i\u03b1\n=\n.\n(11)\n\u03a5i\n\u03c1i\nIf we multiply eqn. (4) by Pji and add over all i we will find a rate eqn. for\n\u03a5j\u03b1 . This, must vanish in equilibria implying that\n\u03a5j\n\nX \u03a5i\u03b1\ni\n\n\u03a5i\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03a5j\u03b1 .\n\n(12)\n\ni\n\nThe term on the righthand side does not depend on i so the summation just\nyields the number of guilds we have chosen to approximate the system. Considering a system with m guilds leads us to conclude that (12) is the same\n\n8\n\n\fas\n\n1 X \u03a5i\u03b1\n\u03a5j\u03b1\n=\n.\nm i \u03a5i\n\u03a5j\n\n(13)\n\nThe lefthand side of this equality does not depend on j, so when the system\nreaches the steady state, the ratio between \u03a5j\u03b1 /\u03a5j must be the same for every\nguild. Combining this with condition (11) we conclude that upon equilibria the\nsystem reaches a configuration in which the ratio between the number of agents\nin a certain state over the total number of agents is independent of the degree,\nthus each guild has exactly the same distribution of states as the entire network.\n\n6\n\nNetwork Structure\n\nThe formalism presented above can be used to understand some topological\ncharacteristics of the studied network. Recently, two groups have presented\nworks indicating that a simple dynamical process like the one studied in this\npaper can be solved, in the case in which two states are involved, by the use of\nconserved quantities or martingales [25, 26]. The first of them proposes that a\nweighted average over degree should be conserved in a dynamical process of this\nkind. In our formalism we average the fraction of agents in each state weighted\nby their relative degree as\nX\n\u03a5i\u03b1 .\n(14)\ni\u03b1\n\nWe can shows that this is a conserved quantity by taking eqn. (4), multiply it\nby Pji and add it over i, j and \u03b1 to get,\n\u0013\nX \u0012 Pji \u03a5i\u03b1 \u03c1i\u03bc\n\u03c1i\u03b1 \u03a5i\u03bc Pji\n\u2202t \u03a5 =\n.\n\u2212\n\u03a5i\n\u03a5i\nij\u03bc\u03b1\nPerforming the summation over \u03b1 on the first term and over \u03bc in the second\nterm and cancelling the \u03a5i we get.\nX\nX\n\u2202t \u03a5 =\nPji \u03c1i\u03bc \u2212\nij\u03b1Pji \u03c1i\u03b1\nij\u03bc\n\nwhich is clearly equal to zero. This quantity is naturally conserved if we consider\nthat \u03a5i\u03b1 represents the fraction of agents in the \u03b1 state that are known by\nsomeone on the the i\u2032 th guild. Thus \u03a5i represents the total numbers of agents\nknow by the i\u2032 th guild, and \u03a5 therefore represents the fraction of agents known\nby all the guilds combined, or in the other words the number of non-intersecting\nsub-graphs of the network that are able to reach all the nodes of it.\nIn a two state system in which each one of them is represented by a spin up\nor down we can show that the degree averaged magnetization does not depend\non time by replacing the fraction of agents in a certain state by the fraction of\nagents in that state times its spin.\n\u03c1i\u03b1 \u2192 \u03c1i\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\n9\n\n\fIf we span \u03a5i\u03b1 we can show that the change on this quantity can be constructed\nby using our formalism as\n\u0013\nX \u0012 Pji Pik \u03c1k\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1 \u03c1i\u03bc \u03c3\u03bc\nX\n\u03c1i\u03b1 Pik \u03c1k\u03bc Pji\nPij \u03c1j\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1 =\n\u2202t\n.\n\u2212\n\u03a5i\n\u03a5i\nij\u03b1\nij\u03bc\u03b1k\n\nwhere the two added terms are strictly equal if we consider that \u03bc and \u03b1 are\nmute variables. This agrees with the results found by Wu et. al. [25] and\ncan be extended to an arbitrary number of spins. Which in this case are nothing more than labels, and we believe its names should not enter the calculations.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing a topologically considerate mean-field approach we were able to characterize the simple dynamics of a node updating mechanism on a complex network\nwith an arbitrary degree distribution.\nThe main idea behind this technique was to group nodes with similar topological\ncharacteristics into aggregates we called guilds. We characterized the reproductive capability of guilds by a quantity we called influence and showed that in\nthe case of a scale-free network the system bias dramatically towards the states\npertaining to the highest degree guilds as the characteristic exponent decrease,\nwhile on an exponential network this effect is comparatively mild.\nIt was also shown that the convergence time scale as a function of connectivity,\nwith a characteristic exponent close to 1, when we considered a network formed\nby mildly connected clusters. This is a consequence of the reinforcement mechanism introduced by the node updating rule. We were also able to show that\nclustered groups tend to be more influential than un-clustered ones. This is due\nto the fact that they are harder to invade, allowing them to act over the system\nfor a longer period of time.\nThe final configuration of the system was unravelled, showing that it arrives to\na stationary distribution in which the fraction of nodes with a certain degree\nthat are in a certain state, over the total number of nodes with that degree, is\nindependent of the particular degree and it therefore mimics the network.\nIn the last section we discussed a purely topological quantity, which is naturally conserved and represents the number of subgraphs present in the network\nwith the ability to held it together. This suggests a direct link with network\nresilience and will be present in future discussions. We also showed that the\ndegree weighted average of states over the system remains constant, regardless\nof the value and number of them in agreement with previous results.\nWork supported in part by Fondecyt project 1020829.
