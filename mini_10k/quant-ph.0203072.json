Our results shed new light on attempts for quantum information processing and storage\nwith atomic ensembles.\n\nCoherent quantum information encoding and processing has recently emerged as a major goal for the physics\ncommunity. Despite the seemingly insurmountable difficulties, a rich variety of implementations are being pursued in laboratories across the globe. Among the early\nsuccess is the apparent ability in simulating quantum operations with liquid based NMR [1, 2]. Recent theoretical\nefforts indicate, however, that in the pseudo-pure state\napproach using NMR, quantum entanglement, a key element for powerful quantum information processing, was\nin fact no present [3, 4]. Room temperature NMR technique, is therefore limited and can not be explored fully\nto benefit from an exponentially large Hilbert space of\nonly a polynominally scaled resources and controls [5].\nNevertheless, early NMR based experiments have provided useful insight into the operations of genuine quantum computers [6].\nOver the last few years, using symmetric collective internal states of an atomic ensemble, has attracted much\nattention [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The pros and cons of such\nan approach assisted with cavity photon-atom interaction was recently discussed by Fleischhauer et al. [9, 10].\nIn normal cavity QED based quantum computing implementations, atomic qubits are entangled and logic operations performed through their interaction with the common cavity photon quantum field. To maintain quantum\ncoherence, it is important to reach the so-called strong\ncoupling regime, when the single-photon coherent coupling g0 \u226b \u03b3, \u03ba, the atomic and cavity dissipation (decoherence) rates respectively [12]. The symmetric collective internal states can reach the strong coupling\n\u221a regime\nwithout requiring a high finesse cavity as g0 \u221d N , with\nN the total number of atoms [13, 14, 15]. When implemented with protocols insensitive to individual atomic\ndissipation/decoherence rate as in the Dark state based\nadiabatic transfer protocols [7, 8, 16], one can apparently\ngain as upper hand over systems based on single atoms\ninside a cavity [9, 10]. This is in fact, not quite surprising, earlier cavity QED experiments have relied on the\nenhanced dipole interaction of a collection of many atoms\n[13, 14, 15]. In free space, the phenomena of superfluorescence or super-radiance [13, 17] constitutes another example of collective state dynamics. Recent experimental\nsuccess clearly demonstrates the power of such an atomic\nensemble based system for entangling macroscopic objects [18, 19]. Several new ideas have raised further ex-\n\npectation of exciting developments to come [20, 21]. Nevertheless, all ensemble based systems suffer from the reduced size of computational Hilbert space. In this case\nof symmetric collective internal states, the space used for\nquantum information, is much less than the V T = 2N as\nfor N two level atoms [22]. In view of the recent experimental success in storage and recovery of light coherence\nin atomic gases [23, 24], a related question to address is\nthe sensitivity to errors when collective spin states are as\nquantum memories.\nIn this paper, we investigate the decoherence for a superposition of symmetric internal states of an atomic gas\ndue to its inhomogeneous coupling with external control\nfields. Our study is motivated by the simple observation\nthat the symmetric states of an atomic ensemble spans\nthe computation space only if atoms can be manipulated\ncooperatively, namely, the coupling of both the external manipulating field and the environment surrounding\nthe atomic ensemble should be homogeneous such that\nthe collective motion of the atomic ensemble can be described by the collective quasi-spin operators. In essence\nthe effect of different spatial positions for atoms 1, 2, * * *,\nand N , is ignored or absorbed into each single spin operators. In reality, an optically thick atomic ensemble suffers from inhomogeneous coupling to both classical and\nquantum light fields, i.e. the coupling strength is position dependent. Such a situation arises naturally for\ntrapped ions due to its center of mass motion. In this\ncase, it is well known that the loss of quantum coherence for a superposition of internal state occurs. In this\nstudy, we refer such decoherence effect as inhomogeneous\ndecoherence. We focus on introducing our technique and\nstudy the simplest example of superpositions of collective\natomic Dicke states in this paper. The consideration of\nDark-state, polariton approach based proposals [10] will\nbe given in the future, as significant complications arise\nwhen the quantum cavity field is included.\nOur model constitutes of an ensemble of two-level\natoms described by Hamiltonian\nH=\n\nN\nX\n1\n1 (k) (k)\n[ \u03c9a(k) \u03c3z(k) + (g0 \u03c3+ + h.c.)],\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere the \u03c3's are the standard Pauli matrices (h\u0304 = 1),\n(k)\nand the different local coupling g0 (for the k-th atom)\nmay be due to a cavity mode profile as common in tightly\n\n\f2\nfocused cavities or when atomic motional wave packet\n(k)\n(k)\nis insufficiently localized [25]. \u03c9a = \u03b5a \u2212 \u03c9L , is the\n(j)\ndifference between atomic energy \u03b5a and the external\nnear resonant laser frequency \u03c9L . For convenience, we\nfurther abstract Eq.

The |J, M i space can be generated\nfrom the ladder operator J\u00b1 = Jx \u00b1 iJy according to [26],\n|J, M i =\n\ns\n\n(J \u2212 M )!\nJ J+M |J, \u2212Ji,\n(J + M )!(2J)! +\n\n(2)\n\nexcept we note that an arbitrary unimodular phasor can be self-consistently included with J\u00b1 =\nPN \u00b1i\u03b8k (k)\n\u03c3\u00b1 /2 and |J, \u2212Ji = | \u2193, \u2193, * * * , \u2193i.\nk=1 e\nFor any realistic system, an inhomogeneous distribu~ (j) makes it impossible to contion of the parameter B\nstrain the system dynamics within the subspace V S . To\nfacility further discussion denote H = H0 + H1 with\nP\n~ \u03c3 (k) and H1 = PN ~b(k) * ~\u03c3 (k) , where\nH0 = N\nk=1 B * ~\nk=1\n~ (k) /N . H0 constitutes the\n~ (k) = B+\n~ ~b(k) with B\n~ =P B\nB\nk\nintended coupling between the symmetric collective spin\nstates, while H1 represents a source of inhomogeneous decoherence. It causes decoherence as it provides a direct\ncoupling from the subspace V S to its complement V O in\nV T . A quantitative measure for the unwanted coupling\nH1 is in terms of the leakage parameter. Suppose initially\nthe system is prepared in a superposition of collective\nspin states |\u03c6(0)i \u2208 V S . The intended dynamics govQ\n~ (k)\n\u2212itB*\u03c3\nleads to the\nerned by U0 (t) = e\u2212itH0 = N\nk=1 e\nresultant state |\u03c6(t)i0 = U0 (t)|\u03c6(0)i, still within the same\nsubspace.

(6) is difficult as state |J, M i\ninvolves\nQ a symmetric permutation of all atoms so that\nthe k factor can not be pulled outside the inner prodQN\nuct. Furthermore, k=1 O(k) expands into 2N separate\nterms, involving asymmetric products of ~\u03c3 (k) of upto\npowers of N . A similar product structure was found to\nbe responsible for decoherence in quantum measurement\nmodels [27], where the decoherence factor (the overlaps of\nthe final states of detector or a environment) suppresses\nthe off-diagonal element of its reduced density matrix.\nIn mathematical terms, for a factorized state |f i =\nQN\nQN\n(k)\n(k)\ni, the overlap integral hf | k=1 WM \u2032 M |f i bek=1 |f\nQN\n(k)\n(k)\ncomes\n|WM \u2032 M |f (k) i, which approaches zero\nk=1 hf\nin the limit of macroscopic N as each factor\n(k)\nhf (k) |WM \u2032 M |f (k) i has a norm less than unity. To make\na similar argument for the present problem, we need to\nfind an expression such that the collective state |J, M i\nbecomes factorized. Since we are interested in obtaining\nthe asymptotically valid results in the limit of large N ,\na short time approximation (small t) can not be simply\nadopted.

This is indeed what we find for M = 0 or in\ngeneral for |M | \u226a J. Equation (12) also indicates that\nsignificantly reduced decoherence does occur in this case\nfor |M | \u223c J, a regime where collective spin states are\nmostly useful [7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 21]. In fact, for a single\n\n80\n\n100\n\n18\n\n(k)\n\n1\n\u221a p\n,\n\u03ba\u03c3z J 1 \u2212 M 2 /J 2\n\n60\n\nFIG. 2: Periodic behavior for |OM M (t)|2 .

This points to a strong physical argument against rapid decoherence of collective spin\nstate qubits. The question to answer is now clearly how\ndoes OMM approach 0 due to inhomogeneous coupling.\n(k)\n(k)\nIf the coupling coefficients g0 and \u03c9a were constants\n(independent of atom label k), OMM \u2032 \u2261 \u03b4MM \u2032 .\nWe investigate the above question for several model\ncases. First, we look at inhomogeneous broadening when\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\nBx = By = 0 and Bz satisfies a normal distribution\n~ = Bz \u1e91 = hBz(k) i\u1e91, and\n(with respect to k) with mean B\n2\nvariance \u03c3z . We find OMM \u2032 (t) \u221d \u03b4MM \u2032 with the coefficient being a constant unity\u221afor |M | = J but decays with\na time constant T1/2 \u221d 1/( N \u03c3z ) for |M | < J . Define\nT1/2 \u2261 1/(f \u03c3z ), we find f is essentially independent of\n\u03c3z for \u03c3z \u2208 [10\u22127 , 10\u22121 ]Bz . It contains an apparent dependence on J 2 \u2212 M 2 as shown in Fig. 1 for a given J\nand Bz . The J dependence (for M = 0) is also shown in\nthe same figure.

For small values of N , when\n(k)\nratios of different coupling strength Bz match ratios of\nintegers, we indeed were able to find the expected revival\nas shown in Fig. 2. This of course will not happen for\nan ensemble with a macroscopic N .\nNext we consider the case of inhomogeneous Rabi cou(k)\npling with Bx/y being Gaussian distributions with mean\n(k)\n\nBx = By = Br and variance \u03c3x2 = \u03c3y2 = \u03c3r2 , and Bz = 0.\nSimilar to the previous case, we find the diagonal term\nOMM (t) (including M = \u00b1J) decays with a time constant T1/2 = 1/f \u03c3r . The J dependence of T1/2 is in fact\nalmost identical, i.e. fM=0 = \u03ba1 J 1/2 , with \u03ba1 \u2248 0.76\nwhen Br = 10. The M dependence, on the other hand\nis more complicated as shown in Fig. 3. Obviously f\ndoes not depend on M linearly as now |OMM (t)| seems\nto decay faster for larger values of |M |.\nThe off-diagonal element OM6=M \u2032 (t) grows to significant nonzero values, as shown by the typical sampling\nof |OMM \u2032 (t)|2 in Fig. 4 when N is not too large. Overall, we find the dependence on the random number sampling is strong only when M \u2212 M \u2032 = \u00b11, so we focus\non M \u2212 M \u2032 = \u00b12 here. Define Tmax as the time for\n|OMM \u2032 (t)| to reach its first maximum and Omax the value\n\n\f4\n\u22123\n\n\u22123\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\nt\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n\u2032\n\n4\n\n(t)|2\n\nx 10\n5\n\nMM\n\nx 10\n\n|O\n\n|O\n\nMM\n\n\u2032\n\n(t)|2\n\n5\n\n0\n10\n\nt\n\nFIG. 4: Typical sampling of OM M \u2032 (t) for J = 100, M = J \u22121,\nand M \u2032 = M \u22121 (solid line) and M \u22122 (dashed line). Different\nfigures correspond to different random number sets.\n\nof the maximum. We find that similar to the diagonals,\nTmax = 1/f \u03c3r , with f a function of J, M, M \u2032 , and Br , although Omax seems to be largely independent of \u03c3r . To\nstudy the J dependence of f and Omax , we consider the\nlimiting case of |M | \u223c J when collective states are usual\nproposed to work. The result f \u221d J 1/2 is once again\nas expected.

This evidence clearly\ndemonstrates that asymptotically there is no advantage\nof using collective\n\u221a spin states for quantum information\nprocessing. The N enhanced\u221acoherent dynamics is simply being compensated by the N enhanced decoherence\nwhen inhomogeneous coupling arises.\nFinally, we note that our result also applies to the\ncase of entangled states between the collective spins of\ntwo separate ensembles.\nFor instance, for two ensembles\nP\nA and B, a state MA ,MB cMA ,MB |JA , MA iA |JB , MB iB\ncan always be expressed as coherent superposition of\nthe total angular momentum basis J~ = J~A + J~B , i.e.\ninto collective basis |JA , JB ; J, M = MA + MB i with\nJ = JA + JB = (NA + NB )/2.\nWe thank Mr. Yueheng Lan for some helpful discussion.
