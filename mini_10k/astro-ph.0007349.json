The maps in these FIR bands extend over\n\u223c3600 sq. arcmin and cover regions around OMC-1, 2, 3 in Orion A and NGC 2023 and NGC 2024 in\nOrion B.

Dust temperature distribution in both Orion\nA and Orion B (south) have been determined reliably using the maps at 205 & 138 \u03bcm obtained from\nsimultaneous observations using almost identical beams (1.\u2032 6 dia). These temperatures have been used to\ngenerate map of \u03c4150 , the optical depth at 150 \u03bcm, for the Orion B region. The coldest source detected\nis in OMC-3 and has a temperature of \u223c 15 K.

Introduction\n\nof dust in the Orion clouds and emits significantly only\nat wavelengths longer than 100 \u03bcm. Earlier observations of Orion A concentrated on the emission from\nthe hot dust viz., mapping of OMC-1 at 50-100 \u03bcm\nby Werner et al. (1976) and of M43 at 37-160 \u03bcm\nby Smith, Harper, & Loewenstein (1987). Later observations have mostly explored the emission from the\ncold dust in this region. The most recent of these observations was by Johnstone & Bally (1999) covering\nOMC-1, 2 and 3 and extending over an area of 50\u2032 \u00d710\u2032\nwith an angular resolution of \u223c 7.\u2032\u2032 5 at 450 \u03bcm and 14\u2032\u2032\nat 850 \u03bcm. Lis et al. (1998) had also mapped a region\nof 6\u2032 \u00d718\u2032 covering OMC-2 and 3 at 350 \u03bcm with an\nangular resolution of 11\u2032\u2032 . However, the pioneering\nwork in detecting a number of cold sources in OMC-2\nand an extremely cold one (\u223c 10 K) in OMC-3 was by\nChini et al. (1997), who mapped a region of \u223c15\u2032 \u00d75\u2032\nwith an angular resolution of \u223c 11\u2032\u2032 at 1300 \u03bcm. Most\nof these condensations are considered to be protostellar candidates because of the associated outflow activities (Castets & Langer 1995). Observations in molecular lines like C18 O by (Castets & Langer 1995, ;and\nreferences therein) have revealed that the gas in OMC2 and OMC-3 have kinetic temperatures equal to 24\nK and 19 K respectively, both much smaller than that\nin OMC-1 (70 K). These observations also identified\n\nIn this paper we present a large scale high angular\nresolution (\u223c1\u2032 ) study of the continuum emission at\n205 and 138 \u03bcm from the two Giant Molecular Clouds\nOrion A and Orion B (south) in the Orion complex.\nThe mapped region of Orion A includes OMC-1, 2,\n3 and IRAS 05327-0457 (NGC 1977). In Orion B\nwe have mapped mainly the southern portion covering\nNGC 2023 and NGC 2024. Limited regions including,\nOMC-1 and 2 in Orion A and NGC 2024 in Orion B\nhave also been observed at 57 \u03bcm.\nThe southern part of the Orion cloud complex, also\nknown as Orion A, contains star forming cores which\nare distributed along the north-south direction (integral\nshaped ridge) and named OMC-1, 2 and 3 from south\nto north. Observations at sub-millimeter/far-infrared\nwavelengths have shown that both warm and cold dust\nwith quite different spatial distribution contribute to\nthe emission from the Orion molecular clouds (Thronson et al. 1986; Chini et al. 1997). Cold dust, with\ntemperature \u223c 20-25 K, accounts for bulk of the mass\n1 Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Homi Bhabha Road,\nMumbai 400 005, India\n2 Inter-University Centre for Astronomy & Astrophysics,\nGaneshkhind, Pune 411 007, India\n\n1\n\n\fresolution far-infrared observations at 205 and 138 \u03bcm\nwith identical beams so that the density and temperature distribution of dust emitting significantly in this\nintermediate regime can be reliably quantified.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the observations and Section 3 contains the results and discussion of the same.\n\nboth, OMC-2 and OMC-3, to be regions of high column density. C18 O observations have also detected\nseveral moderate to strongly collimated bipolar outflows in OMC-3, which suggests recent star formation\nactivity. The very low temperatures of sources in both\nOMC-2 and 3 along with the evidence for star formation, indicate very early stages of evolution of, probably intermediate mass stars. In this paper we have\nexplored the distribution of dust emission and temperature of the Orion A region in a wavelength regime\n(205 & 138 \u03bcm in particular) where no high angular\nresolution measurements exist in literature.\nThe Orion B cloud contains 4 major sites of star formation viz., NGC 2071 & NGC 2068 in the north and\nNGC 2023 & NGC 2024 in the south. We have observed only the regions around NGC 2024 and 2023.\nThe brightest emission source in the region is NGC\n2024, which is a region of active star formation. The\n1300 \u03bcm observations over a region of \u223c 5\u2032 \u00d75\u2032 (with\nan angular resolution \u223c 30\u2032\u2032 ) by Mezger et al. (1988)\nhave revealed six condensations in NGC 2024, aligned\nin the north-south direction. These condensations also\nhave masers and HII regions associated with them.\nThe nature of these condensations was an issue of debate which was resolved by Mezger et al. (1992).\nFrom their observations at 870 & 1300 \u03bcm they concluded that these condensations are indeed isothermal\nprotostars. Lada, Bally, & Stark (1991a) presented\na survey of Orion B (Lynds 1630) molecular cloud\nin CS(2-1) line (1.\u2032 8 angular resolution) and identified\nthe regions including NGC 2023 and NGC 2024 to be\nbright in CS, thus indicating high density of the region.\nIn a follow-up program Lada et al. (1991b) surveyed\nOrion B in the K (2.2 \u03bcm) band and found that more\nthan 50% of the NIR sources are associated with the 4\nidentified star forming regions. In a recent high angular resolution (22-30\u2032\u2032) survey of Orion B (south)\nat 1300 \u03bcm extending over \u223c80\u2032 \u00d768\u2032 , Launhardt et\nal. (1996) have identified some of the dust emission\npeaks around NGC 2023 and NGC 2024 with the CS\ncores detected by Lada, Bally, & Stark (1991a). Of\nthe existing FIR observations of NGC 2023 and NGC\n2024, the IRAS observations in the first place trace\nrelatively warmer dust (\u2265 30 K) and secondly have\nangular resolutions varying with wavelength, so that\ncalculating the temperature distribution from the observed flux densities is not straightforward. On the\nother hand, the 1300 \u03bcm observations, though of high\nangular resolution, trace extremely cold dust. This has\nmotivated us to carry out simultaneous high angular\n\n2. Observations\n2.1. The 205 & 138 \u03bcm maps\nOrion molecular clouds A and B (south) were observed using a two-band far-infrared photometer system (PHT-12) at the Cassegrain focus of the TIFR 1meter (f/8) balloon-borne telescope. The far-infrared\ntelescope was flown from the TIFR Balloon Facility,\nHyderabad, in central India (Latitude = 17.\u25e6 47 N , Longitude = 78.\u25e657 E ) in November, 1995. Details of the\ntelescope and the observational procedure have been\ngiven by Ghosh et al. (1988). The photometer (PHT12) consists of 12 composite silicon bolometers, each\nhaving a FOV of 1.\u2032 6 and arranged in a 3\u00d72 array for\neach band. These arrays are cooled to 0.3 K by liquid\n3\nHe. The sky was chopped at 10 Hz by wobbling the\nsecondary mirror. The chopper throw was 4.\u2032 2 along\nthe cross-elevation axis. The same region of the sky\nwas viewed simultaneously in two bands. The effective wavelengths for the two bands for a \u03bb\u22122 emissivity\nlaw and a temperature of 35 K are 205 \u03bcm and 138\n\u03bcm. Saturn was observed for absolute flux calibration\n(Ghosh et al. 1988) as well as determination of the instrumental Point Spread Function (PSF) including the\neffect of sky chopping.\nThe simultaneous mapping in the two FIR bands\nwas carried out by using raster scans in which the\ntelescope was continuously moved along the crosselevation axis and stepped in elevation. The chopped\nFIR signals were gridded in a two dimensional sky matrix (elevation \u00d7 cross-elevation) with a cell size of\n0.\u2032 3\u00d7 0.\u2032 3 . The observed chopped signal matrix was\ndeconvolved using an indigenously developed procedure based on the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM)\nsimilar to that of Gull & Daniell (1978) (see Ghosh\net al. 1988, for details). The FWHM sizes of the deconvolved maps of the point-like source (Saturn) are\nfound to be 1.\u2032 6\u00d71.\u20329 and 1.\u2032 6\u00d71.\u2032 8 in the 138 and 205\n\u03bcm bands respectively. An optical photometer was\nused at the Cassegrain focal plane to improve the absolute positioning of the telescope during the flight.\nIn addition for all the observations presented here,\n2\n\n\fin Orion B (south) have been observed at both these\nFIR wavelengths. The 57 \u03bcm maps for both sources\ncover relatively smaller regions. Reliable dust temperature T(138/205) maps for selected regions have been\ngenerated utilising the simultaneity of observation and\nnearly identical beams at 205 and 138 \u03bcm. The dust\nemissivity law has been assumed to be \u01eb\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b2 and the\nmethod used is briefly described in Appendix 1. For\nmost star forming regions the emissivity exponent at\nlonger wavelengths (> 100 \u03bcm) is found to be between\n1.5 to 2.5 and the calculated properties of most common types of dust grains (Draine & Lee 1984) show\nthe same at these wavelengths. Based on these facts we\nhave chosen \u03b2 = 2 for deriving the T(138/205) distribution. Considering the uncertainties in the measured\nflux densities and the wavelength regime probed, the\ntemperature computed has an uncertainty of \u223c \u00b12K\nbetween 14 K and 50 K and of \u223c \u00b15K between 50 and\n70 K. The intensity ratio of our FIR bands is rather insensitive to temperatures below 10 K and above 70 K.\nAbove 70 K the estimated temperature has an uncertainty of \u223c \u00b18K. The morphology of the spatial distribution of Td is insensitive to the assumed value of \u03b2.\nOnly the numerical values of Td depend on \u03b2, e.g., a\ntemperature of 15 K for \u03b2 = 2 corresponds to 17 K for\n\u03b2 = 1 and Td = 30 K for \u03b2 = 2 corresponds to 50 K for\n\u03b2 = 1. Distribution of \u03c4150 , the optical depth at 150 \u03bcm\nfor Orion B has also been generated using these dust\ntemperatures and \u03b2 = 2.\nWe have adopted a well-defined extraction algorithm to identify discrete sources in these maps. This\nalgorithm is based on identification of a local maximum followed by a critical study of the growth curve\nof the integrated flux densities in consecutive annular\nrings with the maximum at the center. The reliability of the sources detected in each map has been ensured by the following procedure. The entire observation for each region has been split into two independent datasets (by considering only the alternate scan\nlines in each raster) and processed (deconvolved) separately to generate two maps. The peaks detected in\nboth these maps within a predetermined positional error have been used to quantify the dynamic range and\nalso to validate the detected sources. The final maps\npresented combine all data and positions of the \"confirmed sources\" in the composite maps have been determined. These sources have signals more than 10\ntimes the estimated noise level of the respective maps.\nIn this paper the method of presenting the sources is\nas follows : Peaks identified in any two TIFR wave-\n\nthe signal from this optical photometer measured during the far-infrared scans have been used during offline analysis to further improve the aspect information. The absolute positional accuracy achieved in the\nFIR maps is \u223c 0.\u2032 5 .\n2.2. The 57 \u03bcm map\nLimited regions of both Orion A (OMC-1 & 2)\nand Orion B (NGC 2024) were also observed at 57\n\u03bcm in an earlier flight (November, 1990) of the TIFR\nballoon-borne telescope, using a different photometer (PHT-2). This two band photometer, PHT-2, was\nbased on two liquid 4 He cooled Ge(Ga) bolometers.\nThe FIR passbands were 45\u201370 \u03bcm and 110\u2013160 \u03bcm\nwith effective wavelengths 57 \u03bcm and 150 \u03bcm for an\ninput source spectrum defined by a greybody of temperature 35 K and \u03bb\u22122 emissivity. A 2.\u2032 4 (dia) region of the sky was simultaneously viewed in both\nthe FIR bands. More details of PHT-2 can be found\nin Verma et al. (1994). Here, only the observations\nat 57 \u03bcm are presented, since the other band is very\nsimilar to the shorter waveband of PHT-12 which has\nbetter sensitivity. The PHT-2 was calibrated by observing Jupiter. Some preliminary results from observations of the Orion region have been presented by\nDas et al. (1993). The final results are presented\nhere. The achieved angular resolution in the image\nprocessed maps is \u223c1.\u2032 5 as determined from the observations of Jupiter.\n2.3. The HIRES processed IRAS maps\nTo supplement our balloon-borne observations, we\nhave used the IRAS survey data in all wavebands (12,\n25, 60 and 100 \u03bcm) for the regions mapped by us in\nOrion B (south). These data were HIRES processed\n(Aumann, Fowler, & Melnyk, 1990) at the Infrared\nProcessing and Analysis Center (IPAC1 , Caltech) for\nimproving the angular resolutions of the raw maps.\n3. Results & Discussion\n3.1. Analysis of FIR data\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 respectively show the regions\n(indicated by the dotted boundary) in Orion B (south)\nand Orion A mapped at 205 and 138 \u03bcm. Regions extending over \u223c 42\u2032 \u00d738\u2032 in Orion A and \u223c 38\u2032 \u00d753\u2032\n1 IPAC\n\nis funded by NASA as part of the IRAS extended mission\nprogram under contract to JPL.\n\n3\n\n\fbands are associated if they lie within 1\u2032 . For association with IRAS (HIRES) sources the same parameter\nhas been taken to be 1.\u2032 5. The coordinates quoted for a\nparticular source are for the position of the peak at the\nlongest (TIFR) wavelength at which it is detected.\n\n(not shown in Figure). The temperature map has been\ngenerated by assuming the dust to be optically thin but\nexplicit calculation of optical depth (at 150 \u03bcm) very\nclose to the global intensity peak of OMC-1, shows the\nregions to be optically thick. In such cases, the temperatures quoted would be underestimates by as much as\n5K. However, for OMC-1, 2 and 3, the basic morphology of the isotherms remains unaltered.\nOrion A is an ensemble of cores with a variety of\ntemperatures, physical sizes and masses. This variety\nin physical conditions makes it conducive to harbouring stars in different stages of formation and evolution\nand hence makes it astrophysically interesting. The\nfar-infrared maps presented here also support this variety by showing morphological characteristics strongly\ndependent on the dust temperature. While the 205 and\n138 \u03bcm maps tracing colder dust detect FIR emission\nfrom OMC-2 and OMC-3 very clearly, the 57 \u03bcm map\nfails to do so.\nOMC-1 (A8 in Table 1 and # 1 in Table 2) is the\nbrightest source detected at all wavelengths. As mentioned earlier, the submillimeter fluxes at 450, 790 and\n1100 \u03bcm (Goldsmith, Bergin, & Lis 1997) have been\nused along with the 57, 138 and 205 \u03bcm fluxes to determine Td and \u03b2 for this source. The dust temperature\nobtained by this method is 68 K and the \u03b2 is 0.5. If\ninstead we do a similar fitting omitting the flux density\nat 57 \u03bcm we get Td =30 K and \u03b2 = 1.1. Thus the high\ntemperature and low \u03b2 as presented in Table 1 might be\ndue to the effect of attempting to explain the emission\nover a wide range of wavelengths using a single temperature greybody spectrum. In reality there is probably a cold diffuse component of dust as well which\ncontributes to the emission at longer wavelengths. In\nthe OMC-1 region the maps at 205 & 138 \u03bcm also detect the source A5. Although the position of this source\nat 205 and 138 \u03bcm differ by \u223c1.\u2032 5, we have associated\nthe two, since there is no other nearby source of similar strength. We also note that the temperature of the\nsource A5 is \u223c 80 K, which is even higher than the\ntemperature of A8.\nThe peaks # 2 and # 3 detected at 57 \u03bcm (see Table 2) are not detected at the longer wavelengths. The\nsource # 2 is associated with the HII region M43 and\nthe intensity distribution around it is similar to that\nobserved at 60 \u03bcm by Smith, Harper, & Loewenstein\n(1987). The source # 3 is due to the heating of the dust\nin the photodissociation region around the trapezium\nstars. Northern tip of the emission detected at 57 \u03bcm\nis clearly displaced to the east with respect to the inte-\n\n3.2. Orion A\nFigure 2 shows the 205 and 138 \u03bcm intensity distribution of the mapped region in Orion A. The maps\ninclude the Orion Molecular Clouds 1, 2, 3 and the\nsource IRAS 05327-0457. Figure 3 shows the intensity map for a limited region in Orion A at 57 \u03bcm. Table 1 presents the coordinates and flux densities (in a\ncircle of 3\u2032 dia) for all the discrete sources detected in\nthe mapped regions of Orion A at 205 and 138 \u03bcm. In\nthe same table we also present the longer wavelength\nassociations of these sources along with the measured\nflux densities at 1300 \u03bcm (Chini et al. 1997). For\nthe discrete sources detected at 138, 205 and 1300 \u03bcm\nthe dust temperature (Td ) and the emissivity exponent\n(\u03b2) have been determined by fitting a single temperature greybody spectrum. Td and \u03b2 for A8 have been\ndetermined in a similar manner by using the flux densities measured at 450, 790 and 1100 \u03bcm by Goldsmith, Bergin, & Lis (1997) along with those from\nthe present work. For all other sources with flux densities measured only at 205 and 138 \u03bcm Td has been\ndetermined assuming \u03b2 = 2. For a source not detected\nin any one of the wavebands (marked by \u2020 in Table 1),\nwe give the flux density obtained by integrating at the\nposition of the source as detected in the other waveband(s). Table 2 presents the positions, flux densities\nand associations of these sources detected at 57 \u03bcm.\nThe source IRAS 05327-0457 has been studied in detail in the far-infrared by Mookerjea et al. (2000); here\nwe concentrate mainly on OMC-1, 2 and 3.\nFigure 4 shows the temperature distribution as calculated from the observations at 205 and 138 \u03bcm for\nOMC-1 and 2. The temperature in OMC-1 is as high\nas \u223c 70 K close to the Orion nebula. The temperature of the OMC-1 and the bar region as calculated by\nWerner et al. (1976) from the ratio of 50 and 100 \u03bcm\nflux densities is found to be between 55 and 85 K. For\nthe same region, the temperature calculated from our\n205 and 138 \u03bcm fluxes is between 45 and 70K. This is\nconsistent with the fact that the longer wavelength observations presented here are tracing colder dust component as compared to those traced by the 50 and 100\n\u03bcm observations. The temperature drops to an average\nof \u223c 25 K in OMC-2 and is as low as 15 K in OMC-3\n4\n\n\fgral shaped emission ridge detected in OMC-2 and 3.\nWe can discern local enhancements in T(138/205) map\nclose to the positions of the peaks #2 and #3. These\nstrongly indicate the existence of hotter dust towards\nthe east.\nOf the observations presented here OMC-2 and 3\nare detected only at the longer wavelengths (205 and\n138 \u03bcm). In OMC-2 we detect two sources (A10 and\nA11) at 138 \u03bcm and only one source (A12) at 205 \u03bcm.\nAs suggested by Table 1 the sources detected at our\nresolution are each associated with more than one submillimeter (1300 \u03bcm) sources. We note that whereas\nA10 and A11 are associated with two mutually exclusive groups of submillimeter sources, A12 is associated with sources from both groups. The fact that we\ndetect A10 and A11 only at 138 \u03bcm and A12 only\nat 205 \u03bcm could be due to the presence of a diffuse\ncold component which reduces the contrast between\nthe sources and the intermediate region. This could\neffectively smoothen out the smaller peaks (like A10\nand A11) in this region , thus resulting in only one\npeak (A12) at 205 \u03bcm. The flux densities at 1300 \u03bcm\nof the detected sub-mm sources have been calculated\nusing the peak fluxes and size of the individual sources\n(refer to Table 1 of Chini et al. 1997). For each FIR\nsource the contribution at 1300 \u03bcm from all associated sources are combined and presented in Table 1.\nFor all sources detected in OMC-2 a single temperature greybody spectral fitting gives 20K<Td<25K and\n1.6<\u03b2 < 2.0. Both these are consistent with the results of Chini et al. (1997). Recent radio observations\nat 3.6 cm by Reipurth, Rodriguez, & Chini (1999)\nhave detected sources coinciding with the peaks in dust\nemission. These associations are also presented in Table 1. The radio emission further substantiates that the\nsources detected in OMC-2 though reasonably cold are\nnot only regions of high density but also have YSOs\nembedded in them.\nWe have detected one source (A9) in the OMC-3\nregion. Positionally it is coincident with the sub-mm\nsource MMS 6 (Chini et al. 1997), the latter being the\nbrightest of all the sub-mm sources detected in OMC3. The flux density at 1300 \u03bcm for the source A9 is\nestimated in the same manner as above. A greybody\nspectrum fitted to the measured flux densities gives Td\n= 15 K and \u03b2 = 2.0. A9 is thus the coldest source in\nOrion A, both Td and \u03b2 estimated here are consistent\nwith Chini et al. (1997) and Lis et al. (1998).\nThe total far-infrared luminosity has been estimated\nusing the temperature map (Fig. 4) for the region with\n\nOMC-1 and OMC-2 and the intensity maps of the\nsame region. The dust emissivity exponent assumed\nfor this calculation is 2.0. From the FIR observations\npresented here the total luminosity detected in OMC-1\nand 2 is \u223c3.5\u00d7105 L\u2299 . For a similar region the luminosity based on 60 and 100 \u03bcm observations as given\nby Stacey et al. (1993) is \u223c5\u00d7105 L\u2299 . The diffuse\nemission at these wavelengths has been calculated by\nsubtracting the contribution of the discrete sources and\nis about 25% of the total luminosity.\nThe molecular cloud OMC-1 has long been the\nmost extensively studied region in Orion A. OMC-2\nand 3 have been studied only in the recent past and\nhave been found to be rich and interesting as a star\nforming region. Our observations provide useful constraints on the intensity and temperature distribution of\nthis region.\n3.3. Orion B (south)\n3.3.1. Region around NGC 2024\nFigure 5 presents intensity maps of the region\naround NGC 2024 at 205, 138, 100 and 57 \u03bcm. The\nmap at 57 \u03bcm is for a smaller region, but brings out\nthe main features of NGC 2024 at this wavelength.\nTable 3 presents the measured flux densities at the\n4 IRAS and 3 TIFR wavelengths for the sources detected in this region. The sub-mm and IRAS Point\nSources associated with these FIR sources, along with\nthe sub-mm flux densities measured at 1300 \u03bcm by\nLaunhardt et al. (1996) are presented in the Table 3.\nIn all 7 sources have been identified with sources in\nthe IRAS Point Source Catalog (PSC) and 2 sources\n(B3 and B9) have been found to have sub-millimeter\n(1300 \u03bcm) counterparts. For sources not detected in\none or two of the TIFR bands (marked by \u2020 in Table 3) we have presented the flux densities obtained\nby integrating in a circle around the position of the\nsource as detected at the other wavelength(s). We have\nfitted a single temperature greybody spectrum for all\nsources for which measurement of flux densities at 3\nor more wavelengths longer than 50 \u03bcm exist. The resulting Td and \u03b2 are also presented in the same table.\nFor the remaining sources Td is determined using \u03b2 =\n2. We find that the emissivity exponent (\u03b2) for some\nsources (B6, B10 and B12) are very small (\u2264 0.5).\nIn addition, for B6 and B12 the fitted Td is also very\nhigh. This indicates that for these sources possibly a\ntwo or multi-temperature greybody spctrum is more\nappropriate.\n\n5\n\n\fObservations at 1300 \u03bcm by Mezger et al. (1988)\nhave revealed 6 protostellar condensations within an\narea of 3\u2032 \u00d7 3\u2032 around NGC 2024. The far-infrared\nmaps presented here being of limited angular resolution do not resolve these condensations. However the\n205 \u03bcm and also the 100 \u03bcm maps show evidence of\nnorth-south extension with the northern tip having a\nslight westward bend (position of FIR-1, 2 ; Mezger\net al. 1988). Positionally B9 coincides with FIR5 (brightest condensation detected by Mezger et al.\n1988) and also with LBS 33SM, a CS core detected\nby Lada, Bally, & Stark (1991a) (hereafter LBS), later\ndetected at 1300 \u03bcm by Launhardt et al. (1996).\nThe HIRES map at 100 \u03bcm shows possible signs of\nanomaly, particularly near the peak. The flux density\nmeasured (in 3\u2032 dia) from the 100 \u03bcm map shows a\nvery low value of \u223c18 kJy compared to both the IRAS\nPSC value (35.3 kJy) and results from the KAO observations by Thronson et al. (1984) (85 kJy). We have\nused the measurements of Thronson et al. (1984) in\nthe Table 3 as well as for determining Td and \u03b2 for B9.\nFigure 6 shows the dust temperature distribution\nfor this region. It has been generated using the same\nmethod as for Orion A. It shows several isolated peaks\nwith temperatures varying between 60 to 70 K for most\nof them. The source B3 is quite cold with a maximum\nof 30 K and going below 15 K towards the edges. The\n\u03c4150 map (Figure 6) shows very interesting structure\nclose to the main source B9. It distinctly shows that the\nregion around B9 has an elongated structure with indications of at least 2 condensations. This structure is\nvery similar to the structure shown by the NH3 column\ndensity map generated by Schulz et al. (1991). This\nvery well substantiates the fact that these are indeed\nprotostellar condensations since they are so luminous\nin the infrared as well. The cold source B3 is found to\nbe mostly optically thin (peak 0.07) at 150 \u03bcm.\nThe total luminosity of the region calculated using the same method as for Orion A (Section 3.1) is\n1.0\u00d7105 L\u2299 . The diffuse emission contributes about\n50% (at both the wavelengths) of the total luminosity. This is substantially larger than the value measured\nin Orion A (Sec 3.1) and in other young Galactic star\nforming regions (\u223c 35% in W31; Ghosh et al. 1989) .\nThe morphology of the [CII] (158 \u03bcm) emitting region\nin Orion B (south) as observed by Jaffe et al. (1994)\nagrees very well with the maps presented in this paper.\nThe total [CII] luminosity detected for their assumed\ndistance of 415 pc is 230L\u2299 , while we have estimated\nthe total far-infrared luminosity for a distance of 450\n\npc. Correcting for this difference in distances assumed\nwe find the ratio of the [CII] luminosity to the total FIR\nluminosity to be 3\u00d710\u22123 .\nThe observations presented here, being on a large\nscale and of good angular resolution would be useful\nas guidelines in understanding the star formation scenario vis-a-vis the temperature distribution for future\nlarge scale sub-millimeter continuum observations.\n3.3.2. Region around NGC 2023\nFigure 7 shows intensity maps of the region surrounding NGC 2023 at 205 and 138 \u03bcm alongwith\nHIRES maps at 100 and 60 \u03bcm. The maps at 205 and\n138 \u03bcm are generated by masking NGC 2024 prior to\nMEM deconvolution of the larger map so that details\nof the fainter source NGC 2023 are better visible and\ncomparison with 100 and 60 \u03bcm HIRES maps is easier.\nThe source NGC 2023 appears to have a double structure at 205 \u03bcm. It is of interest to note that the map\nof fluorescent H2 observed by Gatley et al. (1987) exhibits a shell structure with main peaks separated by\nsimilar extent as B13 and B14. The intensity map at\n138 \u03bcm however shows only a single source close to\nthe brighter source (B14) at 205 \u03bcm. Diffuse emission\nextending southward from the main source is clearly\nvisible at 60, 100 and 205 \u03bcm, while at 138 \u03bcm the\nlimited dynamic range of the map restricts this emission to a seemingly isolated peak. Table 3 presents the\npositions, flux densities and associated sources for the\n2 peaks (B13 and B14) detected in this region. The\ncoordinates of the global peaks in the 60 and 100 \u03bcm\nmaps is found to be \u223c 5h 39m 7 \u2032\u2032 - 2\u25e6 17\u2032 44\u2032\u2032 . These\nglobal peaks are separated from B14 by more than 1.\u2032 5.\nSince there is no other detected source of such brightness in the neighbourhood and observations at 100 and\n138 \u03bcm trace dust of similar temperature we have associated B14 with NGC 2023. Both sources B13 and\nB14 have been detected at 1300 \u03bcm by Launhardt et\nal. (1996), but there is no IRAS detection of B13.\nFor both sources we have used the available flux densities at wavelengths longer than 60 \u03bcm to estimate Td\nand \u03b2 from a single temperature greybody spectrum\n(Table 3). The flatness of \u03b2 for B14 indicates the existence of dust components of at least two temperature\nranges. The source B13 is found to be reasonably cold\n(Td = 16 K), thus justifying it's non-detection in the\nIRAS wavebands.\nFigure 8 shows the T(138/205) and \u03c4150 maps for\nthe region around NGC 2023 (derived assuming \u03b2 =\n\n6\n\n\f2). The T(138/205) map shows a peak which does\nnot coincide with the intensity peaks at 205 and 138\n\u03bcm. The T(138/205) peak, however coincides with the\npeak positions at 60 and 100 \u03bcm. The temperature of\nmost of the region is around 30 K and in places goes\ndown to values as low as \u223c 20 K. The \u03c4150 map more\nor less traces the high intensity regions. The \u03c4150 displayed for regions which lie outside the contours of\nT(138/205) map are for an assumed temperature of 10\nK (not plotted in the T(138/205) map).\nNGC 2023, being a well known reflection nebula\nwith a photodissociation region (excited by HD 37903)\nhas been studied in various molecular and fine structure ([CII] at 158 \u03bcm) lines. The continuum maps presented in Figure 7 are morphologically similar to the\nC18 O map by Wyrowski et al. (1997) and CO (J=2-1) map by White et al. (1990). The [CII] observations at 158 \u03bcm by Howe et al. (1991) and Jaffe et al.\n(1994) detect emission which is approximately 25 %\nof the emission from NGC 2024. The rise in temperature, T(138/205), to the north-west of the main peak\nis explained by the presence of the exciting star HD\n37903. The total luminosity measured in this region is\n1.5\u00d7103 L\u2299 . The diffuse emission contributes about\n35% of the total emission, which is smaller than the\ncontribution of diffuse emission around NGC 2024.\nThe total [CII] luminosity from the region as detected\nby Howe et al. (1991) is 7 L\u2299 and is equal to \u223c 0.5%\nof the total FIR luminosity estimated here. This is consistent with results from most of the Galactic star forming regions as given by Howe et al. (1991). Detection\nof low temperature in the region around NGC 2023\nalongwith emission in the far-infrared, support ongoing formation of low to intermediate stars in the region.\nIndication of more than 50 % of the emission being in\nthe condensations further indicates star formation in\nclumps in this region.\n\n3 the very cold source MMS 6 (Chini et al. 1997)\nwas detected at both 205 and 138 \u03bcm and the temperature was determined to be \u223c15\u00b12 K. The far-infrared\ncounterparts of the extremely dense CS cores (Lada,\nBally, & Stark 1991a) LBS 33, LBS 34, LBS 36 and\nLBS 40 were detected in Orion B (south). The total far-infrared luminosity and the relative contribution\nof diffuse emission to the luminosity of these regions\nhave also been quantified.\nWe thank B. Das for his help during initial stages\nof analysis of the 57 \u03bcm data and S.L. D'Costa, M.V.\nNaik, D.M. Patkar, M.B. Naik, S.A. Chalke, G.S.\nMeshram & C.B.

Summary\nIn this paper we have presented large scale high angular resolution (\u223c1\u2032 ) far-infrared (205 and 138 \u03bcm)\nmaps of the Orion A and Orion B (south) molecular\nclouds. For limited regions, maps at 57 \u03bcm have also\nbeen presented. HIRES processed IRAS images at 100\nand 60 \u03bcm of the Orion B have been used for comparison. The regions covered include OMC-1, 2, 3 in\nOrion A and NGC 2024 and 2023 in Orion B (south).\nIn all 15 condensations in Orion A and 14 condensations in Orion B (south) have been identified. In OMC-\n\n7\n\n\fA.\n\nEstimation of dust temperature distribution using the two band FIR observations\n\nAs mentioned in Section 2.1 the spatial intensity distribution in each band is gridded with pixels of size 0.\u2032 3\u00d70.\u2032 3.\nOnly those pixels which have signals exceeding 5 times the noise level of the corresponding map are considered to be\n\"valid\" for the purpose of finding the dust temperature distribution. Each intensity map is first smoothed by taking a\nrunning average over 3\u00d73 \"valid\" pixels. This is done to be extremely conservative about the derived spatial structures\nin the temperature maps. Since the two intensity maps refer to identical portions of the sky and the beams are also\nalmost identical, a \"pixel by pixel\" ratio between the two maps gives reliable dust temperatures.\nFor optically thin emission the observed flux density at any wavelength can be written as\nF\u03bd = \u03a9B\u03bd (Td )\u03c4\u03bd\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the solid angle of the region under consideration.\nWe assume \u03c4\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b2 . Since the pixel sizes are identical the ratio of flux densities at any two wavelengths would be:\nF\u03bd1\n=\nF\u03bd2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bd1\n\u03bd2\n\n\u00133+\u03b2\n\n[exp(h\u03bd2 /kTd ) \u2212 1]\n[exp(h\u03bd1 /kTd ) \u2212 1]\n\n(A2)\n\nThus for an assumed emissivity exponent (\u03b2) the ratio of the flux densities at any two wavelengths is a function\nof the dust temperature only. The temperature is computed using a lookup table containing the calculated ratios of\nflux densities for various temperatures and an assumed \u03b2. This process is repeated for all pixels to generate the dust\ntemperature distribution map.\n\n8\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\nMezger, P. G., Chini, R., Kreysa, E., Wink, J. E., &\nSalter, C.
