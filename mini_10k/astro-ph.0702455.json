Importantly, this method can provide phase models with arbitrary mass\ndistributions. The method is based on the following principle. Our task is to generate an equilibrium N -body system with a given mass distribution. For this purpose,\nwe let the system reach equilibrium through its dynamical evolution. During this\nevolution we hold mass distribution in this system. This principle is realized in our\nmethod by means of an iterative procedure. We have used our method to construct\na phase model of the disc of our Galaxy. In our method, we use the mass distribution in the Galaxy as input data. Here we used two Galactic density models (suggested by Flynn, Sommer-Larsen & Christensen 1996; Dehnen & Binney 1998a). For\na fixed-mass model of the Galaxy we can construct a one-parameter family of equilibrium models of the Galactic disc. We can, however, choose a unique model using\nlocal kinematic parameters that are known from Hipparcos data. We show that the\nphase models constructed using our method are close to equilibrium. The problem of\nuniqueness for our models is discussed, and we discuss some further applications of\nour method.\nKey words: Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics \u2013 galaxies: kinematics and dynamics\n\u2013 methods: N-body simulations\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe construction of equilibrium phase models of galaxies is\nan important area of research in galactic astronomy. Such\nmodels are of interest from a number of points of view. They\nare important for understanding the dynamics of galaxies,\nand they are necessary for defining the initial conditions in\nN -body models of stellar systems.\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of constructing\nan equilibrium model of the stellar disc of a spiral galaxy.\nOur purpose is to construct a phase model of the Galactic stellar disc. Various approaches to solving this problem have been suggested (see, for example, the review in\nRodionov & Sotnikova 2006, hereafter RS06).\nThe first approach is based on Jeans equations (equations for moments of the equilibrium velocity distribution\nfunction). One such method of constructing equilibrium disc\nmodels was described by Hernquist (1993). An advantage of\nthis method is its relative simplicity. It is applicable for a\nstellar disc with an arbitrary density profile and any external\npotential. It has, however, a significant drawback. The system of Jeans equations used is not closed, so it is necessary\nto introduce an additional condition in order to close it. As\na result, the constructed model is often far from equilibrium,\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: seger@astro.spbu.ru\n\nas we showed when we used the closure condition suggested\nby Hernquist (1993). A more detailed critical analysis of this\nmethod is given in RS06.\nThe second approach is based on Jeans theorem, according to which any function of motion integrals is a solution\nof the stationary collisionless Boltzmann equation (see, for\nexample, Binney & Tremaine 1987); that is, it is an equilibrium distribution function. There is, however, one significant disadvantage of such an approach to constructing a\nthree-dimensional equilibrium model of a stellar disc. Two\nintegrals of motion are well known for axisymmetric models: E is energy and Lz is the angular momentum about the\nsymmetry axis. However, for systems having phase density\nf (E, Lz ), the dispersions of the residual velocities in the\nradial and vertical directions have to be the same, which\nis in disagreement with observations of spiral galaxies, in\nparticular for the solar neighbourhood (see, for example,\nDehnen & Binney 1998b). Axisymmetric models with different velocity dispersions in the radial and vertical directions\nmay be constructed if the phase density depends on three\nintegrals of motion f (E, Lz , I3 ), where I3 is the third integral of motion. However, an expression for the third integral\nis not known for the general case. It is possible to use the\nenergy in vertical oscillations as the third integral when the\nresidual velocities are much lower than the rotation velocity\nwith respect to the symmetry axis (cold thin disc). In such a\n\n\f2\n\nS.A. Rodionov, V.V. Orlov\n\nway, one can construct models of approximately exponential\nstellar discs, as done, for example, by Kuijken & Dubinski\n(1995); Widrow & Dubinski (2005). These authors also describe the procedure of phase density construction for multicomponent models of disc galaxies.\nOne further original method for constructing phase\ngalactic models was developed by Schwarzschild (1979). In\nthis method, it is assumed that the total galactic potential\nis known. A large number of orbits (library of orbits) in\nthis potential are constructed, and a model consisting of the\nparticles placed on these orbits is constructed in such a way\nthat the resulting model has an initial density profile. We\nnote that this approach is similar to our Orbit.NB method\ndescribed below.\nIn this paper, we use a new iterative method proposed\nin RS06. In RS06, the iterative method was applied to construct a model of the stellar disc of a spiral galaxy (the\nproblem under consideration). In our notation, this realization of the iterative method is termed Nbody.SCH. It\nhas, however, a number of disadvantages. The Nbody.SCH\nmethod has a problem with the construction of a relatively\ncold stellar disc: using the Nbody.SCH method it is not\npossible to construct a sufficiently cold equilibrium stellar\ndisc. The stellar disc of our Galaxy is rather cold. The\nmodel of the stellar disc of our Galaxy constructed using the\nNbody.SCH method is notably far from equilibrium. Moreover, the Nbody.SCH method cannot be directly applied to\na stellar system with arbitrary geometry (for example, it\ncannot be applied to elliptical galaxies).\nThe first objective of our work is to develop a new realization of the iterative method without the disadvantages of\nthe Nbody.SCH approach. The second objective is to construct a phase model of the Galactic disc using this new\nmethod.\nUsing the iterative method we can construct a phase\nmodel of a stellar system with a given mass distribution. Therefore, in order to construct a phase model\nof the Galactic disc we need the mass distribution of\nthe Galaxy. A number of density models for the Milky\nWay Galaxy have been constructed. We use only two\nof them (see Flynn, Sommer-Larsen & Christensen 1996;\nDehnen & Binney 1998a).\nThe density models used are described in Section 2. In\nSection 3 we present the iterative method and its modifications. Two versions of the iterative method are considered in\ndetail. In our notation, these methods are called Orbit.NB\nand Nbody.NB. The Orbit.NB method gives fairly specific\nand probably non-physical models. Although such models\nare probably non-physical, the fact that such equilibrium\nmodels exist is of interest. It gives some insight into the\nproblem of uniqueness of phase models of the stellar disc.\nThe models constructed by the Orbit.NB method are discussed in Section 4. We think that the models constructed\nby Nbody.NB method are physical. In Section 5 we present\nphase models for the Galactic disc constructed using this\nmethod. It is important, that Nbody.NB solves the first objective of our work (see above). A summary of the results is\ngiven in Section 6, wherein we also discuss further applications of our method and models.\n\n2\n\nGALACTIC DENSITY MODELS\n\nThere\nare\nmany\nGalactic\ndensity\nmodels\nin\nthe literature. We have chosen two of them\n(see\nFlynn, Sommer-Larsen & Christensen\n1996;\nDehnen & Binney 1998a). We note that Dehnen & Binney\n(1998a) presented a whole family of density models. We\nhave chosen the model '2' from this paper. Both models\nunder consideration are axisymmetric.\nLet us briefly outline the models used.\n2.1\n\nModel of\nFlynn, Sommer-Larsen & Christensen (1996)\n\nThis model contains three main components: a dark halo,\ncentral component, and disc. For the dark halo, the authors\nused a logarithmic potential (see Binney & Tremaine 1987,\np. 46):\n\u03a6H (R, z) =\n\n1 2\n2\nVH ln(r 2 + rH\n),\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere VH and rH are the halo parameters (circular velocity\nat large\n\u221a r and halo scalelength), R is the cylindrical radius,\nr = R2 + z 2 is the spherical radius.\nThe central component consists of two spherical subsystems. The first one represents the bulge+stellar halo;\nthe second one is the inner core of the Galaxy. Each\ncomponent is approximated by a Plummer sphere (see\nBinney & Tremaine 1987, p. 42\u201343). The expression for the\nwhole potential of the central component has the form\nGMC2\nGMC1\n\u2212p\n,\n\u03a6C (R, z) = \u2212 p\nr 2 + r C1 2\nr 2 + r C2 2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant; MC1 and rC1 are the\nmass and scalelength for the first subsystem; and MC2 and\nrC2 are the same parameters for the second.\nThe disc in this model is the superposition of three\nMiyamoto & Nagai (1975) discs. The whole disc potential\nhas the form\n\u03a6D (R, z) = \u2212\n\n3\nX\nn=1\n\nGMDn\n.\n\u221a\nR2 + (an + z 2 + b2 )2\n\np\n\n(3)\n\nHere, b is the disc scaleheight (which is the same for all three\ncomponents); the parameters an are the disc scalelengths;\nand the values MDn are the masses of the disc components.\nFlynn, Sommer-Larsen & Christensen (1996) have suggested the following values for the above parameters:\nrH = 8.5 kpc, VH = 210 km s\u22121 ,\nrC1 = 2.7 kpc, MC1 = 3.0 * 109 M\u2299 ,\nrC2 = 0.42 kpc, MC2 = 1.6 * 1010 M\u2299 ,\nb = 0.3 kpc,\nMD1 = 6.6 * 1010 M\u2299 , a1 = 5.81 kpc,\nMD2 = \u22122.9 * 1010 M\u2299 , a2 = 17.43 kpc,\nMD3 = 3.3 * 109 M\u2299 , a3 = 34.86 kpc.\nTable 1 in Flynn, Sommer-Larsen & Christensen (1996)\ncontains a small misprint: instead of VH = 220 km s\u22121 it\nshould be VH = 210 km s\u22121 (Flynn, private communication). We note that one of the disc components (n = 2)\nhas a negative density; however, the total density in the\ndisc is positive, and the model is therefore physical. Over a\nlarge range in R, the disc density profile is approximately\nexponential, with a scalelength of approximately 4 kpc. This\n\n\fPhase models of the Milky Way stellar disc\nTable 1.

Hereafter, we will refer to this model as FSLC.\nFig. 1 shows the dependences of cumulative masses M (r)\nand circular velocity curves for the whole FSLC model, for\nall components without the disc, and for the disc only.\n\nstellar Galactic disc. As the stellar disc, we take only the\nthin stellar disc from the DB2 model. The construction of a\ntwo-component stellar disc in this model will be the subject\nof future investigations.\nIn addition to the density, we need to calculate\nthe potentials of the various components in the DB2\nmodel. The potentials were numerically calculated using\nthe code GALPOT by Walter Dehnen. The method of\npotential determination is described in (Dehnen & Binney\n1998a). The code was taken from the NEMO package\n(http://astro.udm.edu/nemo; Teuben 1995).\nThe cumulative mass profile M (r) and circular velocity\ncurve for the DB2 model are shown in Fig. 1 for the whole\nmodel, for all components apart from the thin stellar disc,\nand for the thin stellar disc only.\nFig. 1 shows that the FSLC and DB2 models are different. The FSLC model has a more massive and concentrated\nbulge with respect to the DB2 model. In particular, this\nmassive bulge is the reason for the central peak in the rotation curve for the FSLC model. Furthermore, the relative\ndisc contribution in the whole mass and the circular velocity\ncurve for the inner model (R \u2264 8 kpc) is significantly higher\nin the DB2 model than in the FSLC model.\n\n3\n2.2\n\nModel of Dehnen & Binney (1998a)\n\nIn addition to the FSLC model, we consider one model of\nthe family suggested by Dehnen & Binney (1998a). Every\nmodel of this family consists of five components. There are\nthree disc components (interstellar medium (ISM), thin stellar disc, and thick stellar disc) and two spheroidal components (dark halo and bulge).\nThe distribution of volume density in each disc component has the form\n\u03c1d (R, z) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n|z|\n\u03a3d\nRm\nR\nexp \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n.\n2zd\nRd\nRd\nzd\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03a3d is the central surface density of the component, and\nparameters Rd and zd give scalelength and scaleheight of the\ncomponent.

This choice is somewhat arbitrary. We do not consider other models from this paper because a comparison\nof the different Galactic models is outwith the goals of this\npaper. The parameters of the DB2 model are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The details of the construction of this model\nare given in Dehnen & Binney (1998a).\nHere we construct an equilibrium N -body model of the\n\n3\n\n3.1\n\nITERATIVE METHOD FOR EQUILIBRIUM\nMODELS CONSTRUCTING\nBasic idea of iterative method\n\nThe iterative method is used to construct N -body models\nclose to equilibrium and with a given mass distribution (see\nRS06 for details). The basic idea of this approach is as follows. First, we generate an N -body system with a given\nmass distribution but with arbitrary initial particle velocities (which, for example, can be taken as zero). Furthermore,\nwe let the system reach equilibrium through its dynamical\nevolution. During this evolution we hold mass distribution\nin the system. If necessary, some parameters of the velocity\ndistribution can be fixed. This is achieved in the following\nway.\nThe general algorithm of the iterative method is as follows.\n(1) An N-body system with a given mass distribution but\nwith arbitrary particle velocities is constructed. The velocities can, for example, be taken to be zero.\n(2) The system is evolved on a short time-scale.\n(3) We construct a new N-body system, with the same\ngiven mass distribution but with velocities chosen according\nto the velocity distribution in the system already evolved.\nWe note that, if there are some limitations on the velocity distribution, this distribution should be corrected taking\ninto account these restrictions (see the discussion below).\n(4) We return to point 2. We repeat such cycles until the\nvelocity distribution stops changing.\nAs a result, we obtain an N -body model close to equilibrium that has a given density profile (see RS06 and our\nresults below for details).\nWe can discuss the iterative approach in a more general\nmanner. When one needs to find an equilibrium state of an\narbitrary dynamical system, but so that this state has some\n\n\f4\n\nS.A. Rodionov, V.V. Orlov\n\nFigure 1.

Here the cumulative mass M (r) is the mass inside the sphere of radius r. Solid lines\nshow the dependences for a whole model; long-dashed lines correspond to the whole model without the disc; and short-dashed lines\ncorrespond to the stellar disc only. We use the thin stellar disc in the DB2 model as the stellar disc.\n\nnecessary properties (in the case under study, the dynamical system is a set of gravitating points and the necessary\nproperty is the density profile), one can simply give a possibility for the system itself to tune to the equilibrium state,\nholding the necessary parameters.\nThe idea of our iterative method is simple. Its realization in practice is more complicated. The main difficulty is\nthe third stage, when it is necessary to construct a model\nwith the same velocity distribution as the evolved model\nfrom the previous iteration step.\nBelow we discuss an application of the iterative procedure to the problem of constructing an equilibrium model\nof the Galactic disc.\n\n3.2\n3.2.1\n\nEquilibrium models of stellar disks\nFamily of equilibrium models\n\nOur task is to construct an equilibrium model of the stellar\ndisc of our Galaxy. We consider all Galactic components as\naxisymmetric, and can formulate our task in the following\nway. We need to construct an equilibrium N -body model of a\nstellar disc with a fixed density distribution \u03c1disk (R, z) that\nis embedded in the rigid external potential \u03a6ext (R, z), where\n\u03a6ext (R, z) is created by all Galactic components except the\nstellar disc (i.e. the dark halo and bulge).\nIt can be expected that at least a one-parameter fam-\n\nily of equilibrium models will exist when the functions\n\u03c1disk (R, z) and \u03a6ext (R, z) are fixed. The parameter of this\nfamily is the fraction of kinetic energy contained in the residual motions.\nThe reason why this family exists is as follows. It is\npossible to show that, if \u03c1disk (R, z) and \u03a6ext (R, z) are fixed,\nthen for all equilibrium discs the total kinetic energy should\nbe the same. This is a direct consequence of the virial theorem. This kinetic energy can, however, be distributed between regular rotation and residual velocities in different\nmanners. Cold equilibrium models exist when a large fraction of the kinetic energy is concentrated in the regular rotation (an extreme case is the model with circular orbits),\nand hot equilibrium models exist when a large fraction of\nthe kinetic energy is concentrated in the residual motions.\nIn RS06, the authors showed that, for exponential disc,\na one-parameter family of models can be constructed by the\niterative method for fixed \u03c1disk (R, z) and \u03a6ext (R, z). If the\niterations are started from different initial states, different\nmodels result; however, they all form a one-parameter family. As expected, the parameter is the fraction of kinetic energy concentrated in the residual motions. In order to obtain\na definite model from this one-parameter family, the method\nsuggested in RS06 can be used. We simply fix the fraction\nof kinetic energy during the iterative process. In principle,\nwe could fix any value characterizing the \"heat\" degree of\nthe disc. The authors of RS06 suggest using the value of an-\n\n\fPhase models of the Milky Way stellar disc\ngular momentum about the z-axis (symmetry axis) as this\nparameter:\nLz =\n\nN\nX\n\nmi v\u03c6i Ri ,\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere mi , v\u03c6i , Ri are the mass, azimuthal velocity, and\ncylindrical radius of the i-th particle.\nWe fix the value of Lz at each iteration step. When we\nhave constructed a new model (which has the same velocity\ndistribution as the slightly evolved model from the previous\niteration step), we correct the azimuthal velocities so that\nthe total angular momentum of the system is the same as\nthe fixed value of Lz . This is done as follows. Let Lz be this\nfixed angular momentum, and let L\u2032z be the current value\nof the angular momentum. The new azimuthal velocities of\nparticles are prescribed as follows:\n(Lz \u2212 L\u2032z )\n\u2032\nv\u03c6i = v\u03c6i\n+ PN\n,\nR mj\nj=1 j\n\n(8)\n\n\u2032\nwhere v\u03c6i\nis the current value of the azimuthal velocity of\nthe i-th particle, and v\u03c6i is the corrected azimuthal velocity\nof the i-th particle.\nWe note that by using the iterative method with fixed\nLz , one can construct colder models with respect to the\nones without Lz fixed (because the cold stellar disc tends\nto heating during the dynamical evolution). The stellar disc\nof the Galaxy is rather cold. Thus it is difficult to construct\na cold model of the Galactic disc without fixing Lz . We\ntherefore fix Lz in all our models.\n\n3.2.2\n\nVariants of the velocity distribution \"transfer\"\n\nWe first discuss the core of the iterative method, namely an\nalgorithm to transfer the velocity distribution (item 3 in the\niterative procedure).\nThe transfer problem is as follows. We have an \"old\"\nmodel. This is an evolved model from the previous iteration\nstep from which we would like to copy a velocity distribution. Moreover, we have a \"new\" model that is constructed\naccording to the fixed density distribution. We have to give\nthe velocities to the particles in the new model using the\nvelocity distribution in the old model. How do we do this?\nIn RS06, the authors used an algorithm of velocity distribution \"transfer\", which is based on assuming that the\nparticles have a truncated Schwarzschild velocity distribution. We describe this approach briefly. We take a disc model\n(old model) from which we are going to \"copy\" the velocity distribution. The model is divided along the R-axis into\nvarious regions (concentric cylindrical tubes). For each region, we calculate four velocity distribution moments (v\u0304\u03c6 ,\n\u03c3R , \u03c3\u03c6 , \u03c3z - the mean azimuthal velocity and three dispersions of residual velocities along the directions R, \u03c6, and\nz). These moments are used for the velocity choice in the\nnew model. We assume that the velocity distribution is the\nSchwarzschild one, but without the particles that can go out\nof the disc (see RS06 for details).\nWe slightly modified this scheme of velocity transfer.\nThe model is divided into regions not only along the R-axis,\nbut also along the z-axis. The regions are chosen in such a\nway that they all contain similar numbers of particles.\n\n5\n\nThis method of velocity distribution transfer has, however, two drawbacks (even in its modified form). First, an a\npriori assumption is made that the velocity distribution is\nthe Schwarzschild one. Second (and more importantly), this\nmethod cannot be used for other geometry systems (e.g. triaxial elliptical galaxies).\nWe have developed another method of velocity distribution transfer. We believe that it is a more general and\nsimpler method. The basic idea of this new method is as follows. We prescribe to the new-model particles the velocities\nof those particles from the old model that are nearest to the\nones in the new model.\nThe simplest (although not quite successful, as we show\nbelow) implementation of this idea is evident. One can prescribe to each particle in the new model the velocity of the\nnearest particle from the old model. Let us formulate this\nproposition more strictly. For each ith particle from the new\nmodel, one finds the old-model jth particle with the mininew\nmum value of |rnew\n\u2212 rold\nis the radius vector\ni\nj |. Here, ri\nof the ith particle in the new model, and rold\nis the radius\nj\nvector of the jth particle in the old model. One then takes as\nthe velocity of the ith particle in the new model the velocity\nof the jth particle in the old model.\nThis simple algorithm has, however, one essential problem. If the numbers of particles in the old and new models\nare the same then only about one-half of the particles in the\nold model participate in the velocity transfer. The reason is\nthat many old-model particles have a few particles in the\nnew model to which they transfer their velocities. At the\nsame time, almost one-half of the particles in the old model\ndo not transfer their velocities at all. This means that a significant amount of information on the velocity distribution\nwill be lost in the transfer process. The noise will therefore\ngrow, and this is indeed observed in numerical simulations.\nThus, one cannot construct an N -body model close to equilibrium by the iterative method described above using this\ntransfer algorithm.\nIt is, however, possible to modify the transfer scheme in\norder to overcome this failure. An input parameter of this\nimproved algorithm is the \"number of neighbours\" nnb . For\neach particle in the old model, we introduce the parameter nuse , which denotes the number of times this particle is\nused for velocity copying. At the beginning of the transfer\nprocedure, we assume nuse = 0 for each particle in the old\nmodel. We then consider all particles in the new model. For\neach particle from the new model, we find the nearest nnb\nneighbours in the old model (in this case, the closeness is understood as the minimum distance between the particles in\nthe old model and the point at which the particle of interest\nfrom the new model is placed). We then reveal a subgroup of\nparticles that have a minimum nuse among these nnb neighbours, and among this subgroup we find the particle that\nis the closest one to the position of the new-model particle.\nWe prescribe to the new-model particle the velocity of the\nfound particle from the old model. Moreover, we add one to\nthe parameter nuse of this old-model particle.\nWe note that this algorithm is the same as the previous\none if nnb = 1. As mentioned above, the problem with this\nalgorithm is that only one-half of the particles take part in\nthe velocity distribution transfer. If we take nnb = 10, only\na small fraction (a few per cent) of old-model particles do\nnot take part in the transfer process. Using this improved\n\n\f6\n\nS.A. Rodionov, V.V. Orlov\n\ntransfer method in the iterative procedure gives good results in the sense that the constructed models are close to\nequilibrium.\nIn this method, one can take into account that the\ngalactic models under study are axisymmetric. One just has\nto redefine the distance between the particles. That is, one\ncan search for the nearest particles in two-dimensional space\nRz instead of three-dimensional space XY Z. In this case,\none should transfer the velocities in cylindrical coordinates\nin order to remove any dependence on the azimuthal angle.\nThis guarantees that the constructed model has an axisymmetric velocity distribution. We use this method when constructing the model of the Galactic stellar disc (see below).\nWe note that this method of velocity transfer is universal, and can be applied in systems with arbitrary geometry.\nThe models constructed in this way are close to equilibrium, but, partly because of this, the method has a small\ndisadvantage. The iterations converge much more slowly\nthan the ones in the above-mentioned method based on the\nSchwarzschild velocity distribution. The reason for this slow\nconvergence is that even intermediate models are fairly close\nto equilibrium, so that the models change only slightly over\none iteration, and the iterations converge slowly.\n\n3.2.3\n\nDifferent ways of system evolution simulations\n\nWe discuss one more way to modify the iterative method. In\nthe general algorithm of the iterative procedure, item 2 allows the model to evolve over a short time-scale. This means\nthat one needs to simulate the self-consistent N -body evolution of the stellar disc during a short time in the field\nof the external potential \u03a6ext . There is, however, another\npossibility. Instead of simulating the self-consistent dynamical evolution of the N -body system, one can simulate the\nmotions of N massless test particles in the regular galactic potential \u03a6disk + \u03a6ext , where \u03a6disk is the disc potential\ncorresponding to the density \u03c1disk . We note that the simulation of a system of N test particles in a rigid potential is\nmuch less cumbersome than simulation of the self-consistent\nN -body system.\nAt first glance, both methods have to give practically\nthe same results, because the initial stellar disc has the density profile \u03c1disk that creates the potential \u03a6disk . It is expected that the iterations will converge to an equilibrium\nstate. Therefore in the self-consistent case, the disc at the\nlate stages of the iterative process will be close to equilibrium\nand will not significantly change its density profile during a\nsingle iteration (especially because we follow the evolution\nover a short time-scale).\nHowever, the iterative methods using these two modes\nof calculation may lead to essentially different results (see\nbelow).\n\n3.2.4\n\nComparison of different realizations of iterative\nmethod\n\nWe thus have two ways to perform the velocity distribution\ntransfer. The first one is based on calculations of the velocity\ndistribution moments and assumes a Schwarzschild velocity\ndistribution (hereafter we refer to this method as SCH). The\nsecond is based on prescribing to the particles in the new\n\nmodel the velocities of the nearest particles in the old model\n(hereafter we refer to this method as NB).\nWe also have two ways of performing system simulations. The first one is the self-consistent simulation of the\nN-body gravitating system evolution (hereafter we refer to\nthis approach as Nbody). The second is the calculation of\nmassless particle orbits in the regular potential \u03a6disk + \u03a6ext\n(hereafter we refer to this approach as Orbit).\nWe thus have four versions of the iterative method:\nNbody.SCH, Nbody.NB, Orbit.SCH, and Orbit.NB. Our\ntask is to choose from among them the method that will\nbe used to construct a phase model of the Galactic stellar\ndisc.\nWe will show in Section 4 that the Orbit.NB approach\ngives models that are probably non-physical. However, the\nvery fact of the existence of such \"strange\" equilibrium models is of interest, and gives food for thought (see Section 4\nfor details).\nWe thus need to choose from among three approaches:\nNbody.NB, Nbody.SCH, and Orbit.SCH. Our test simulations have shown the following. The models of hot discs\nconstructed by all these approaches are similar. The only\nexception is that the models constructed by the Nbody.NB\nmethod are slightly closer to equilibrium. However, the models of cold discs are significantly different. In particular, this\nconcerns models of the Galactic disc, because the Galactic\ndisc is rather cold. The models of cold discs constructed with\nthe Nbody.NB approach are close to equilibrium, whereas\nthe ones constructed with the Orbit.SCH and Nbody.SCH\napproaches are quite far from equilibrium. We can therefore\nconclude that the Orbit.SCH and Nbody.SCH approaches\nare not suitable for constructing equilibrium models of cold\nstellar discs. Moreover, from a methodical point of view, it\nis more correct to use the NB transfer approach, because\nhere we do not make any a priori assumptions concerning\nthe form of the velocity distribution (in contrast to the SCH\nmethod).\nWe shall thus use the Nbody.NB approach to construct\nphase models of the Galactic stellar disc (see Section 5).\n3.2.5\n\nTechnical comments\n\nWe note a few important technical details.\nIn the iterative method, there is one parameter - the\ntime interval ti of each iteration. This is the time interval\nover which the system evolves during each iteration. How\ndo we choose the value of ti ? This time should not be too\nshort, because in this case the system would have no time\nto evolve during one iteration step. On the other hand, it\nshould not be too long. At least, this time should be much\nshorter than the typical times of development of various instabilities; otherwise, these instabilities may change the system substantially. We cannot suggest any strict criterion for\nchoosing ti . We have chosen a value from numerical simulations. Our simulations have shown that, if we take ti within\nreasonable limits (not too short and not too long), the constructed models are the same (within the noise limits). Of\ncourse, this is valid only when we use the model with the\nsame Lz (see Section 3.2.1). In any case, a basic test of every method to construct the equilibrium models would be a\nnumerical check that the model is close to equilibrium.\nWe have used the following modification of the iterative\n\n\fPhase models of the Milky Way stellar disc\nmethod in several simulations. We do not take a fixed iteration time, but choose this time randomly within the range\n(0, tmax\n). If one makes the iterations with the fixed ti , the\ni\nfollowing situation may occur in principle. The iterations\ncould converge to an artificial non-equilibrium state when\nthe model has large changes at intermediate times within\none iteration, however in the end of iteration, it could have\nthe same state as in the beginning of the iteration. Another\nsituation that could occur is that the model could jump from\none state to another, i.e. oscillations between two states occur. The random choice of the iteration step enables us to\navoid such situations. However, if we consider the Nbody.NB\napproach, fixed and random iteration steps give practically\nthe same models as output.\nIn many of our simulations, we used the following\nmethod to decrease the CPU time. Initially, we make the iterations have a low accuracy (for example by using a smaller\nnumber N of bodies) and then gradually increase the accuracy up to a pre-defined limit. This scheme was used in all\nsimulations of Section 5.\nIn all our N -body simulations (self-consistent\nscheme), we used the TREE code (Barnes & Hut\n1986) and a few other codes from the NEMO package\n(http://www.astro.umd.edu/nemo; Teuben 1995). We used\nour original codes to simulate the motions of particles in\nthe rigid potential.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nNON-PHYSICAL MODELS. HYPOTHESIS\nOF UNIQUENESS\nModels constructed with the Orbit.NB\napproach\n\nIn this section we consider the models constructed with the\nOrbit.NB approach. We will show that these models are\nprobably non-physical models. However, the very fact of the\nexistence of such models is of interest. It gives some insight\ninto the problem of uniqueness of phase models of the stellar\ndisc.\nOne noteworthy feature of the iterative Orbit.NB approach is that usually at fixed \u03c1disk (R, z), \u03a6ext (R, z), and\nLz essentially different models can be constructed by means\nof this approach, although all other versions of the iterative\nmethod give similar (within the limits of noise) final models\nat a fixed value of Lz . Another important feature of this approach is that the velocity distributions of the final models\nare very different from the Schwarzschild distribution. We\nconsider this fact in more detail below.\nLet us consider a model constructed by the Orbit.NB\napproach. We take the FSLC density model (see Section 2.1); that is, the disc density \u03c1disk is taken from the\nFSLC model, and the rigid potential \u03a6ext is generated by\nall FSLC model components except the disc. The disc density is taken to be zero at R > Rmax = 30 kpc or |z| >\nzmax = 10 kpc. We take the cold initial model in which all\nparticles move along circular orbits. We used 1000 iterations\nfor N = 200, 000, and then 100 iterations for N = 500, 000.\nThe integration step was taken as dt = 0.5 Myr. The number of neighbours for the velocity distribution transfer was\ntaken to be nnb = 100. We used a scheme with randomized\niteration time (see Section 3.2.5) with tmax\n= 100 Myr. Duri\ning the iterative process, we fixed the angular momentum as\n\n7\n\nFigure 2. Dependences of v\u0304\u03c6 , \u03c3R , \u03c3\u03c6 , and \u03c3z on R in the\nFSLC.O model constructed by the Orbit.NB method.\n\nLz = 6.412 * 1013 M\u2299 kpc km s\u22121 . We note that in all simulations the following system of units was used: gravity constant\nG = 1, length unit ur = 1 kpc, time unit ut = 1 Myr. In\nthis system of units, the chosen value is Lz = 0.295 (hereafter we indicate the parameter Lz in this system of units).\nWe refer to this model as FSLC.O. We consider only this\nmodel; however, we emphasize that very different models\nmay be constructed by the Orbit.NB approach at fixed Lz\nif we take different initial models.\nIn addition to the constructed FSLC.O model, we consider its changes during further dynamical evolution (selfconsistent N -body evolution of the constructed stellar disc\nin the field of the external potential \u03a6ext ). The parameters of simulation are taken as follows: number of bodies\nN = 100 000, integration time step dt = 0.04 Myr, softening\nlength \u01eb = 0.025 kpc. Two last parameters were chosen according to the recommendations of Rodionov & Sotnikova\n(2005).\nThe radial profiles for four moments of the velocity distribution v\u0304\u03c6 , \u03c3R , \u03c3\u03c6 , and \u03c3z , are shown in Fig. 2. It can be\nseen that the profiles of v\u0304\u03c6 , \u03c3R , and \u03c3\u03c6 have unusual forms.\nThey have various peaks and dips. It would seem that such a\ncomplicated system cannot be stable; however, the FSLC.O\nmodel is close to equilibrium! When we follow its evolution,\nit emerges that the constructed model conserves structural\nand dynamical parameters very well (see Fig. 3).\nAn interesting question arises in connection with the\nFSLC.O model equilibrium: how do the moments of the velocity distribution satisfy the equilibrium Jeans equations\n(see Binney & Tremaine 1987):\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nv 2\u03c6\n\n=\n\n2\n\u03c3\u03c6\n\n=\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2202(\u03c1disk \u03c3z )\n\u2202z\n\n=\n\n2\n2\nvc2 + \u03c3R\n\u2212 \u03c3\u03c6\n+\n2\n\u03c3R\nR\n2v \u03c6\n\n2\n)\nR \u2202(\u03c1disk \u03c3R\n,\n\u03c1\u0011\n\u2202R\ndisk\n\n\u2202v \u03c6\nv\u03c6\n+\n\u2202R\nR\n\u2202\u03a6tot\n\u2212\u03c1disk\n.\n\u2202z\n\n\u0010\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nHere \u03a6tot = \u03a6disk + \u03a6ext . Fig. 4 shows the radial profiles of\nv\u0304\u03c6 , \u03c3\u03c6 , and \u03c3z from the FSLC.O model and from the Jeans\nequations (9) (see also RS06). It can be seen that the model\nfollows the Jeans equations very well. This is an unexpected\nfinding, especially considering such unusual moment profiles.\n\n\f8\n\nS.A. Rodionov, V.V. Orlov\n\nFigure 3. Initial evolutionary stages for the FSLC.O model. The upper snapshots show the disc views face-on for various moments\nof time (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 Myr); the grey intensities correspond to the logarithms of particle numbers in the pixels. Middle and\nbottom panels show the dependences of various disc parameters on the cylindrical radius R for various moments of time. Here n is the\nnumber of particles in concentric cylindrical layers; 2z1/2 is twice the median of the value |z| (it is a parameter of the disc thickness, see\nSotnikova & Rodionov 2006); v\u0304\u03c6 , \u03c3R , \u03c3\u03c6 , \u03c3z are four moments of the velocity distribution.\n\nAnother important feature of the FSLC.O model is\nthat the velocity distribution in this model is far from the\nSchwarzschild distribution. The velocity distributions in the\nsolar neighbourhood (near R = 8 kpc) are shown in Fig. 5.\nInitially, both radial and azimuthal velocity distributions\nare far from Gaussian, although such unusual distributions\nare more or less in equilibrium. At least, they are conserved\nduring the initial stages of evolution. However, these distributions are unstable, and they change substantially after\nabout 500 Myr. After about 1 Gyr, the distributions are\nsmoothed and tend to Gaussians.\nAbove we have discussed the self-consistent evolution\nof the FSLC.O model. It is also interesting, however, to examine a non-self-consistent evolution of this model; that is,\nto calculate the evolution of N test particles in the total\n\npotential of the FSLC model. As expected, the model practically does not change during such \"evolution\" (at least on\na time-scale of 10 Gyr). In particular, the density profile\nand non-Schwarzschild velocity distribution do not change.\nThus, this shows again that this non-Schwarzschid velocity\ndistribution is in equilibrium.\n\nAll models constructed using the Orbit.NB approach\nhave the following properties. They are close to equilibrium.\nMoreover, the velocity distributions in the models are nonSchwarzschild ones and may have various forms. However,\nthe velocity distributions tend to the Schwarzschild distribution during the dynamical evolution on a time-scale of\n1 Gyr. Thus, although these models are close to equilibrium, they are probably non-physical because of their non-\n\n\fPhase models of the Milky Way stellar disc\n\n9\n\nFigure 4.

The arguments are as\nfollows.\n\u2022 The velocity distribution of the stars in the solar neighbourhood is similar to the Schwarzschild distribution (see,\nfor example, Binney & Merrifield 1998).\n\u2022 The constructed non-Schwarzschild velocity distributions are almost in equilibrium, but are unstable. The velocity distributions always tend to the Schwarzschild one\nduring the evolution.\n\u2022 In the models constructed using the Nbody.NB approach, the final velocity distributions are close to the\nSchwarzschild distribution (see Fig. 6). We note that the\nNbody.NB and Orbit.NB approaches differ only in the\nmethod of evolution simulations in the iterations (see Section 3.2.3).\nGenerally speaking, we can assume that such unusual\nnon-Schwarzschild velocity distributions will survive only in\nthe \"hothouse\" conditions of the Orbit.NB approach because the evolution simulation in this approach is carried\nout non-self-consistently (see Section 3.2.3). When the conditions are close to realistic (as in the Nbody.NB approach),\nsuch distributions are smoothed and gradually converge to\nthe Schwarzschild distribution.\n\n4.2\n\nUniqueness hypothesis\n\nIn RS06, the authors formulated a hypothesis of uniqueness:\nnot more than one equilibrium model (one equilibrium distribution function) can exist for a fixed density \u03c1disk (R, z)\nand potential \u03a6ext (R, z) and a fixed kinetic energy fraction\nof residual motions (e.g. a fixed angular momentum Lz ).\nWe can now say that in such a form the hypothesis is false. We can construct using the Orbit.NB approach as many equilibrium models as we want for the same\n\u03c1disk (R, z), \u03a6ext (R, z) and fixed Lz . However, although these\nmodels are close to equilibrium, they probably bear no relation to actual stellar systems.\n\nAt the same time, the models constructed by the\nNbody.NB approach are the same (within the noise level)\nfor arbitrary initial states at the same \u03c1disk (R, z), \u03a6ext (R, z)\nand fixed Lz . Moreover, the velocity distributions in constructed models are always close to the Schwarzschild distribution. Based on this fact and the probable non-physical\ncharacter of the Orbit.NB models, one can formulate a hypothesis that the \"physical\" discs in the equilibrium state\nare unique. This hypothesis could be formulated as follows.\nWhen the functions \u03c1disk (R, z) and \u03a6ext (R, z) are fixed and\na fraction of the kinetic energy in the residual motions is\nalso fixed (e.g. the value of the angular momentum Lz is\nfixed), not more than one physical model in the equilibrium\nstate may exist (the physical model is the model that can\nexist in reality). We think that the main feature of a real\nstellar disc is an almost Schwarzschild velocity distribution.\nWhether or not our hypothesis is true is very important. If we know the mass distribution in the Galaxy and\nour hypothesis is valid, we can use our Nbody.NB method\nto reconstruct the velocity distribution in the Galactic disc.\nIn other words, we can construct a phase model of the Galactic disc, and this model will correspond exactly to the real\nGalactic disc.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nPHASE MODELS OF THE GALACTIC\nSTELLAR DISK\nChoice of model among the family of models\n\nFor the construction of phase models of the Milky Way\nGalactic disc, we use the Nbody.NB approach (see Section 3.2). Using this method, one can construct a family\nof models for the fixed functions \u03c1disk (R, z) and \u03a6ext (R, z).\nThis is a one-parameter family, and the parameter is the\nfraction of kinetic energy of residual motions (in other words,\nthe disc \"heat\" degree). In our approach, this parameter is\nthe value of Lz . We emphasize that, using the Nbody.NB\n\n\f10\n\nS.A. Rodionov, V.V. Orlov\n\nFigure 5.

The distributions of radial and azimuthal velocities in the solar neighbourhood in the models constructed using the Nbody.NB\napproach. We consider the disc region of 7.5 kpc < R < 8.5 kpc. Left panels: the distributions of radial velocities. Right panels: the\ndistributions of azimuthal velocities. The upper pictures were constructed for the FSLC.N model, and the lower ones for the DB2.N\nmodel. Description of both models is given in Section 5.2. The solid lines show the model distributions, and the dashed lines correspond\nto the Gaussians with parameters (mean and dispersion) taken from the models.\n\napproach, when we fix the value of Lz we obtain the same\nmodel (within the noise level) regardless of the initial state.\nA family of the N -body models for the FSLC density\nmodel is shown in Fig. 7 as an example. The parameters\nof the models are given below. One can ask how we choose\nthe best-fitting model among the family. We have comparatively reliable kinematic Galactic parameters in the solar\nneighbourhood (see, for example, Binney & Merrifield 1998;\nDehnen & Binney 1998b), so it is reasonable to use them to\nchoose the model. One needs to choose any one parameter\nthat on the one hand is well known in the solar neighbourhood, and on the other depends strongly on the disc \"heat\".\nIn other words, this value has to be strongly dependent on\nthe value of Lz . For example, the velocity ellipsoid parameters v\u0304\u03c6 , \u03c3R , \u03c3\u03c6 , and \u03c3z are well known. The value \u03c3z is not\n\nsuitable, because it does not depend on Lz (see Fig. 7 and\nRS06). The value v\u0304\u03c6 is also unsuitable, because it depends\nweakly on Lz for cold models (see Fig. 7). The choice between the two values \u03c3R and \u03c3\u03c6 is somewhat arbitrary. We\nprefer the value \u03c3R for the model choice.\nThere are various estimates of the value of \u03c3R in the\nliterature. We have chosen the value \u03c3R = 35 km s\u22121 that\nwas estimated using an extrapolation to the zero heliocentric\ndistance (see Orlov et al. 2006). In addition, we adopted the\nsolar distance from the Galactic centre as R0 = 8 kpc (see,\nfor example, Nikiforov 2004; Avedisova 2005).\nAs a result, we have chosen the model in which the radial velocity dispersion in the solar neighbourhood is about\n35 km s\u22121 . As the solar neighbourhood, we have chosen the\nregion 7.9 kpc < R < 8.1 kpc and |z| < 0.1 kpc.\n\n\f12\n\nS.A. Rodionov, V.V. Orlov\n\nFigure 7.

Models constructed for Lz = 0.302, 0.3, 0.29, 0.28, 0.27 are\nrepresented. The model with Lz = 0.302 is the FSLC.N model corresponding to the Galactic stellar disc.\n\n5.2\n\nModels FSLC.N and DB2.N\n\nWe have considered two families of stellar disc models constructed for two Galactic density models (FSLC and DB2).\nThe families of phase models were constructed using the\nNbody.NB approach. From every family, we have chosen the\nstellar disc model that corresponds to the Galactic disc in\nthe solar neighbourhood (in terms of the radial velocity dispersion). Hereafter we refer to these models as FSLC.N and\nDB2.N.\nThe family of models for the FSLC density model is\nshown in Fig. 7. It was constructed in the following way.\nWe took as \u03c1disk the disc density distribution from the\nFSLC model, and as \u03a6ext the potential arising from all\nFSLC model components except the disc. The disc density was taken as equal to zero at R > Rmax = 30 kpc\nor |z| > zmax = 10 kpc. We considered an initial cold model\nin which the particle orbits are circular. Four iteration sets\nwith increasing accuracies were calculated. The parameters\nof the sets are shown in Table 3. The number of neighbours\nin the velocity distribution transfer is nnb = 10. The time of\none iteration is ti = 50 Myr. The FSLC.N model was constructed for the angular momentum Lz = 0.302 (this value\nis given in our system of units as described in Section 4.1).\nThe family of models for the DB2 density model, in par-\n\nTable 3.

The density of the thin stellar disc in the DB2 model\nwas taken as \u03c1disk , and the potential arising from all components except the thin stellar disc was taken as \u03a6ext . The\ndisc density at R > Rmax = 30 kpc or |z| > zmax = 10 kpc\nwas taken as equal to zero. This is the same condition as\nin the FSLC model. Here we again consider the cold initial\nmodel with circular orbits. Four sets of iterations were again\ncalculated. The parameters of these sets are shown in Table\n\n\fPhase models of the Milky Way stellar disc\n3. We have adopted the parameters nnb = 10, ti = 50 Myr.\nThe DB2.N model was constructed for the angular momentum Lz = 0.1595 (this value is given in our system of units\nas described in Section 4.1).\nThe radial profiles of the velocity distribution moments\nfor the FSLC.N and DB2.N models are shown in Fig. 8.\nLet us consider the profiles of \u03c3R and \u03c3\u03c6 . In the central\nparts of the models, these profiles are very different. This\nis caused by the more massive and concentrated bulge in\nthe FSLC.N model with respect to the DB2.N model (see\nFig. 1 in Section 2). However, the profiles of \u03c3R and \u03c3\u03c6 for\nthe two models are similar from about 2 \u2212 3 kpc. This is\nin spite of the difference between the initial density models.\nIn particular, one can observe a different relative disc contribution in the total mass and rotation curve (see Fig. 1).\nFig. 8 also shows that the profiles of \u03c3z are different. However, we note that the value of \u03c3z at any point is defined\nonly by the density distribution. This fact is a consequence\nof the last Jeans equation (9). Our phase models satisfy the\nJeans equations very well, however, and therefore the differences in the \u03c3z profiles are explained by the differences in\nthe density models.\nThe initial stages of the evolution for the FSLC.N and\nDB2.N models are shown in Figs 9 and 10. Both models conserve the structural and dynamical parameters in the early\nstages of the evolution very well. Therefore both models are\nclose to equilibrium.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have discussed the problem of constructing a phase model of the Galactic stellar disc. We used\nthe iterative method proposed in RS06. The realization of\nthe iterative method described in RS06 (Nbody.SCH approach) has some disadvantages. The Nbody.SCH method\nhas a problem with the construction of a relatively cold\nstellar disc. Furthermore, the Nbody.SCH method cannot\nbe directly applied to stellar systems with arbitrary geometry. The main goal of this study was to develop a new\nrealization of the iterative method without the disadvantages of the Nbody.SCH approach. For this purpose, we considered a number of modifications of the iterative method\n(Nbody.SCH, Orbit.SCH, Nbody.NB, and Orbit.NB). The\nNbody.NB method satisfied our conditions. This method can\nbe directly applied for the construction of phase models of\nstellar systems with arbitrary geometry. The method is simple in terms both of understanding and of implementation.\nUsing the Nbody.NB approach, we have constructed phase\nmodels of the Galactic disc for two realistic density models\n(suggested by Flynn, Sommer-Larsen & Christensen 1996;\nDehnen & Binney 1998a).\nFor a given mass distribution model of the Galaxy, we\ncan construct a one-parameter family of equilibrium models\nof the Galactic disc. From this family we can choose a unique\nmodel using local kinematic parameters that are known from\nthe Hipparcos data. There are, however, two important questions. Is there an equilibrium disc model besides the models\nfrom this one-parameter family? Does the real Galactic disc\nbelong to this one-parameter family? (Of course this family\nshould be constructed for a real mass model of the Galaxy.)\nThe answer to the first question is affirmative. Using the Or-\n\n13\n\nbit.NB method, we can construct many models besides the\nmodels from this one-parameter family. We have, however,\nshown that these models are probably non-physical. Based\non this fact, we suppose that all models except models from\nthis one-parameter family are non-physical. Consequently,\nwe think that the answer to the second question is also affirmative. However, we cannot strictly prove it as yet. We\nthink that the key to the proof is Schwarzschild velocity distributions. The models from our one-parameter family have\nalmost such velocity distributions, and we think that the\nvelocity distributions in real galactic discs are close to the\nSchwarzschild distribution.\nWe now discuss possible applications of our Nbody.NB\nmethod.\nThis method can be used to construct phase models of\nstellar systems with arbitrary geometry. For example, the\nmethod can be used to construct phase models of triaxial\nelliptical galaxies.\nHere we have used the iterative method to construct\na phase model of the stellar disc of a spiral galaxy. In the\nfuture, we are going to construct a self-consistent model of a\nspiral galaxy (including live halo and bulge) using a modified\nNbody.NB approach.\nAnother, rather more important, direction of future investigations is a comparison of our iterative models with\nobservations of real galaxies. This comparison will make it\npossible to derive from observations the constraints on unobservable parameters of galaxies (for example dark matter\nmass and its profile). Of course, such a comparison should\nfirst be carried out for the Milky Way. One of the possible schemes is as follows. If we know the mass distribution\nin the Galaxy then using our method we can construct a\nphase model of the Galactic disc. The mass distribution in\nthe Galaxy contains two parts - visible and dark matter.\nFrom the phase model of the Galactic disc, we can derive the\nprofiles of stellar kinematic parameters (profiles of velocity\ndispersions and mean azimuthal velocity). Let us assume\nthat we know from observations the mass distribution of\nvisible matter and the profiles of stellar kinematic parameters. Then, using the iterative method, we can put some\nconstraints on the dark matter mass distribution. The distribution of the dark matter should be such that the iterative\nmodel has the observable kinematics. At the moment, observational profiles of stellar kinematic parameters have fairly\nlarge uncertainties; however, it is expected that the GAIA\nmission will provide a much higher accuracy for these data.\nWe are planning to study which constraints on the Milky\nWay parameters we can obtain from GAIA using our iterative models.\nThe iterative method can also be used to derive the velocity dispersion profiles from observations. It is impossible\nto obtain the velocity dispersion profiles for external spiral galaxies directly from observations, which can yield only\nthe line-of-sight velocity, vlos , and the line-of-sight velocity\ndispersion, \u03c3los . However, we can use the Jeans equations\nto derive the velocity dispersion profiles from the observed\nquantities vlos and \u03c3los . In practice, however, one has to include some a priori assumptions about the form of the velocity dispersion profiles. In the literature, authors have made\nslightly different assumptions, but all of them are based on\nthe hypothesis that the velocity dispersion in the radial di-\n\n\f14\n\nS.A. Rodionov, V.V.

The moments were calculated in cylindrical layers infinite along the z-axis.\n\nrection is proportional to the velocity dispersion in the vertical direction (see section 3 in RS06).\nUsing our iterative method, we can derive the velocity\ndispersion profiles from line-of-sight parameters without any\nadditional assumptions. The general idea is as follows. From\nobservations we have (more or less precisely) the distribution\nof visible mass and some constraints on the distribution of\ndark matter. If we fix the mass distribution in a galaxy (for\nvisible and dark matter) then, using the iterative method,\nwe can construct a one-parameter family of phase models of\nthe galactic disc. The parameter of this family is the degree\nof disc heating (for example the fraction of the kinetic energy\nof the disc contained in residual motions). Using observable\nprofiles of vlos and \u03c3los , we can choose a unique model from\nthis family. As a result, we will have a phase model of the\ngalactic disc. From this model we can calculate the velocity\ndispersion profiles.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Drs Nataliya Sotnikova and Mariya Kudryashova\nfor many helpful comments.\nWe thank for financial support the government of\nSaint-Petersburg (grant PD07-1.9-51), Russian Foundation\nfor Basic Research (grant 06-02-16459), and Leading Sci-\n\nentific School (grant NSh-8542.2006.02 and grant NSh4929.2006.02).\n\nREFERENCES\nAvedisova V.S., 2005, Astron.
