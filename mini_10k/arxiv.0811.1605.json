V6T 1Z1, Canada\n\narXiv:0811.1605v2 [physics.atom-ph] 20 Mar 2009\n\n(Dated: April 14, 2019)\n\nWe present a formalism for rigorous calculations of cross sections for inelastic and reactive collisions of ultracold atoms and molecules con\u001cned by laser \u001celds in quasi-2D geometry. Our results\nshow that the elastic-to-inelastic ratios of collision cross sections are enhanced in the presence of a\nlaser con\u001cnement and that the threshold energy dependence of the collision cross sections can be\ntuned by varying the con\u001cnement strength and external\np magnetic \u001celds. The enhancement of the\nelastic-to-inelastic ratios is inversely proportional to \u000f/~\u03c90 , where \u000f is the kinetic energy and \u03c90\nis the oscillation frequency of the trapped particles in the con\u001cnement potential.\n\nAtomic ensembles cooled to ultracold temperatures\ncan be con\u001cned by optical forces of counterpropagating\nlaser beams to form a periodic lattice structure. Optical\nlattices can be used to produce low-dimensional quantum\ngases by con\u001cning the motion of ultracold particles in\none or two dimensions [1]. Ultracold atoms can be combined to form ultracold molecules. Molecules con\u001cned in\nlow dimensions may undergo inelastic and chemically reactive collisions, which suggests the possibility to study\nchemistry in restricted geometries. Several previous studies showed that collision dynamics of ultracold molecules\nrestricted to move in two dimensions is di\u001berent from\nscattering processes in an uncon\u001cned three-dimensional\n(3D) ultracold gas [2, 3, 4, 5]. The e\u001bect of the con\u001cning\nlaser force on inelastic and reactive collisions of molecules\nin an optical lattice, however, remains unknown. Ultracold atoms and molecules in restricted geometries may\nbe used for quantum simulations of fundamental manybody systems [6, 7] and the development of novel schemes\nfor quantum computation [8, 9, 10]. An analysis of inelastic scattering in a quasi-2D trapped gas is necessary\nto understand the feasibility of the quantum simulation\nproposals [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Ultracold atoms and molecules\ntrapped in a quasi-2D geometry can also be used as controllable model systems of excitons and exciton polaritons in microcavity semiconductors [11, 12, 13]. Studies of inelastic interactions in quasi-2D ultracold gases\nmay thus \u001cnd applications for new research in chemical physics, quantum condensed-matter physics, quantum optics of semiconductors and quantum information\nscience.\nCollision dynamics of atoms and molecules at ultracold\ntemperatures is determined by Wigner's threshold laws\n[2, 14], which give the energy dependence of the scattering cross sections in the limit of low energies. The threshold laws change with the dimensionality of the system [2].\nHowever, the interaction of molecules con\u001cned by a harmonic laser force in one dimension cannot be described\nas a collision process in two dimensions [3, 4]. Molecules\ncon\u001cned in a one-dimensional optical lattice move freely\nin two dimensions and oscillate harmonically in the third\ndimension, which is usually referred to as a quasi-2D geometry. At the same time, the interaction forces between\n\nthe colliding molecules are much stronger than the laser\ncon\u001cnement. The reactive complex of molecules is therefore unconstrained and the reaction process occurs in 3D.\nAn inelastic collision or chemical reaction releases a lot\nof energy and accelerates the collision products, which\nare therefore free to move in 3D as well. The e\u001bect of the\ncon\u001cning laser force is thus only to restrict the motion of\nmolecules before the collision. Petrov and Shlyapnikov\ndeveloped a theory of elastic collisions between atoms in\na quasi-2D gas based on the renormalization of the scattering wave function [3]. Here, we extend their work to\ndevelop the formalism for quantum calculations of probabilities for inelastic and chemically reactive collisions\nof molecules con\u001cned in quasi-2D geometry. Our work\nleads to an important conclusion that the ratio of cross\nsections for elastic and inelastic collisions is enhanced in\nthe presence of laser con\u001cnement.\nIn a quasi-2D system, the strength of the laser con\u001cnement\ncan be described by the oscillation length l0 =\np\n~/\u03bc\u03c90 , where \u03c90 is the frequency of the harmonic potential and \u03bc is the reduced mass for the collision complex. The oscillation length of the con\u001cning potential is\nusually much larger than the characteristic radius re of\nintermolecular interaction potentials [3]. Therefore, at\nshort interparticle separations r < re , the interaction between collision partners is not a\u001bected by the con\u001cning\npotential and the wave function in the region of r between re and the characteristic de Broglie wavelength of\nthe particles \u039b\u0303\u03b5 is proportional to the 3D s-wave scattering wave function [3]. The theory of Petrov and Shlyapnikov [3] relates the quasi-2D scattering wave function in\nthe region re \u001c r \u001c \u039b\u0303\u03b5 to the 3D wave function by a\nproportionality coe\u001ecient \u03b7\u03c60 (0), where \u03c60 is the wave\nfunction for the lowest energy oscillation in the con\u001cning potential. In the present work, we assume that the\ntemperature of the con\u001cned gas is much smaller than ~\u03c90\nand molecules prepared in state \u03b1 are trapped in a quasi2D geometry. We consider collision processes that induce\ntransitions from state \u03b1 to another state \u03b10 and assume\nthat any transition \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b10 results in loss of con\u001cnement.\nThe indices \u03b1 and \u03b10 are used to describe the internal\nenergy as well as the chemical identity of the colliding\nparticles, i.e. they specify the collision channels. The\n\n\f2\nprobability of inelastic or chemically reactive collisions\nin 3D scattering is described by the elements S\u03b10 \u2190\u03b1 of\nthe scattering S -matrix. At r > re , di\u001berent collision\nchannels are uncoupled. We express the s-wave component of the wave function for the con\u001cned channel \u03b1 at\nre \u001c r \u001c \u039b\u0303\u03b5 as a regular single-channel wave function\nin 3D multiplied by \u03b7\u03c60 (0)\n\u03c8\u03b1 (r) =\n\n\u0003\ni\u03b7\u03c60 (0) \u0002 \u2212ik\u03b1 r\ne\n\u2212 S\u03b1\u2190\u03b1 eik\u03b1 r \u03c6\u03b1\n2k\u03b1 r\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k\u03b1 is the wave number of the collision complex,\n\u03c6\u03b1 is the eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian at r = \u221e and\nS\u03b1\u2190\u03b1 is the S -matrix element for elastic scattering in\n3D. Repeating the procedure of Petrov and Shlyapnikov\n[3] and using Eq. (1), we obtain the following expression\nfor \u03b7 in terms of the S -matrix element\n\u03b7=\n\n1\n(1\u2212S\u03b1\u2190\u03b1 )w(\u000f/2~\u03c90 )\nik\u03b1 l0\n\n+\n\n\u221a\n\n.\n\u03c0(1 + S\u03b1\u2190\u03b1 )\n\n(2)\n\nHere, \u000f is the collision energy and w(\u000f/2~\u03c90 ) is a complex\nfunction given by w(\u000f/2~\u03c90 ) = ln(B~\u03c90 /\u03c0\u000f) + i\u03c0 [3]. In\nthe limit of k\u03b1 \u2192 0, the matrix element S\u03b1\u2190\u03b1 is related\nto the scattering length a of ultracold particles as a =\n\u2212 (S\u03b1\u2190\u03b1 \u2212 1) /2ik\u03b1 .\nIn the region re \u001c r \u001c \u039b\u0303\u03b5 , the wave function (1) for\nchannel \u03b1 can be generally written as\n1\n\n\u03c8\u03b1 =\n\n\u2212\n\u0003\n\u03bd\u03b1 2 r\u22121 \u0002\n\u221a\nA\u03b1 e\u2212ik\u03b1 r \u2212 B\u03b1 eik\u03b1 r \u03c6\u03b1 ,\n4\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere A\u03b1 and B\u03b1 are the amplitudes of the incoming\nand outgoing scattering waves, and \u03bd\u03b1 is a normalization\nconstant [15]. At re \u001c r \u001c \u039b\u0303\u03b5 , A\u03b1 can be written as\n\u03c7A\u03b1 , where A\u03b1 is the amplitude of the incoming scattering wave for s-wave collisions in 3D. Comparing the\ncoe\u001ecient in front of the term e\u2212ik\u03b1 r in Eq. (1) with\n\u221a that\nin Eq. (3) and using the conventional form A\u03b1 = i \u03c0/k\u03b1\n[16], we obtain the coe\u001ecient \u03c7\n\u03c7=\u2212\n\n\u221a\ni \u03c0\u03b7\u03c60 (0)\n= \u03b7\u03c60 (0).\nk\u03b1 A\u03b1\n\n(4)\n\nThe con\u001cnement thus modi\u001ces the amplitude of the incoming scattering wave in the 3D collision region re \u001c\nr \u001c \u039b\u0303\u03b5 . Since the asymptotic motion of the collision\nproducts after a reactive or inelastic process is unconstrained, a combination of the spherical Hankel functions\nand 3D spherical harmonics should be used to describe\nthe wave function in the outgoing collision channels\n\u22121\n\n\u03c8\u03b10 l0 m0l = \u2212\u03bd\u03b10 2 r\u22121 B\u03b10 l0 m0l ei(k\u03b10 r\u2212l \u03c0/2) \u03c6\u03b10 Yl0 m0l (r\u0302), (5)\n0\n\nwhere l0 is the rotational angular momentum (partial\nwave) of the collision complex in state \u03b10 and m0l is its\nprojection on the quantization axis.

(10) shows that the cross sections for inelastic or\nreactive collisions in a quasi-2D gas depend on the 3D\nscattering length of the colliding particles in state \u03b1 as\nwell as the con\u001cnement strength. In order to illustrate\nthe e\u001bect of these parameters on inelastic scattering, we\npresent in Fig. 1 the results of rigorous calculations for\ncollisions of 87 Rb atoms in the mf = 0 state with 6 Li\natoms in the mf = \u2212 12 state, leading to Zeeman relaxation in a magnetic \u001celd. The quantum numbers mf\ndenote the projections of the total angular momenta of\nthe atoms on the magnetic \u001celd axis. The calculations are\nbased on accurate interaction potentials for the 6 Li\u221287 Rb\nmolecule [17]. The scattering length a of the 6 Li\u221287 Rb\nsystem is tuned by varying an external magnetic \u001celd\nnear the Feshbach resonance at 1104.9 G.

In order to examine the dependence of\nthe suppression on the scattering length, we present in\nFig. 2 the cross sections for inelastic Zeeman relaxation\nin 3D and quasi-2D collisions of 6 Li and 87 Rb atoms as\nfunctions of the magnetic \u001celd varying through the resonance. The position of the Feshbach resonance is shifted\nby the con\u001cnement in agreement with previous calculations of elastic cross sections [3, 18, 19]. The e\u001bect of the\ncon\u001cnement is enhanced near the resonance.\nThe inelastic cross section is suppressed because in\nthe limit of zero collision energy it must smoothly approach the threshold energy dependence for scattering\nin a purely 2D geometry [5]. In order to quantify\nthe suppression of inelastic scattering, it is necessary\nto consider the ratio of cross sections for elastic and\ninelastic collisions. The elastic-to-inelastic ratio is of\nparamount importance for experiments with ultracold\natoms and molecules. Elastic collisions determine the\nmacroscopic dynamics of quantum gases. Inelastic and\nchemically reactive collisions destroy ultracold atoms and\nmolecules. The ratio of cross sections for inelastic and\nelastic scattering in a quasi-2D gas can be written as\nquasi\u22122D\nquasi\u22122D\n3D\n3D\n\u03c3in\n/\u03c3el\n= \u03b3\u03c3in\n/\u03c3el\n, where \u03c3 3D denote the\ncross sections in an uncon\u001cned 3D gas.

The\ndegree of the enhancement is given quantitatively by the\nequation above. This general result is illustrated by a\nnumerical calculation in Fig. 3.\nThe formalism presented in this paper can be applied\n\n\f4\nto describe chemical reactions in an ultracold molecular\ngas under laser con\u001cnement. The index \u03b10 in Eq. (10)\nmust then include outgoing channels in di\u001berent chemical\nreaction arrangements. To explore the e\u001bect of laser con\u001cnement on chemical interactions of ultracold molecules,\nwe consider an illustrative example of the reaction 7 Li\n+ 6 Li2 (v = 0, N = 1) \u21927 Li6 Li + 6 Li. The cross sections for elastic scattering and chemical rearrangement\ntransitions in 7 Li + 6 Li2 collisions have been calculated\nby Cvita2 et al [20]. Using their results and Eq. (10) of\nthis paper, we evaluate the cross sections for the chemical reaction in a con\u001cned gas (Fig. 4). We note that the\nresults presented in this paper apply to a gas of particles trapped in the ground state of the laser con\u001cnement\npotential. The limit of 3D scattering therefore cannot\nbe obtained from our results simply by increasing l0 . As\ndescribed by Petrov and Shlyapnikov [3], the limit of 3D\nscattering is obtained by heating the system so that the\nparticles populate a manifold of states in the con\u001cnement\npotential.\nAs demonstrated by Cvita2 et al [20], rigorous quantum calculations of cross sections for ultracold reactive\nscattering in 3D are computationally very demanding,\nthough not impossible. Breaking the symmetry of space\nby applying an external \u001celd increases the complexity of\nthe scattering problem to a great extent and converged\nreactive scattering calculations in the presence of external \u001celds are at present impossible [21]. The theory presented here makes the analysis of reactive scattering of\nmolecules in a quasi-2D gas feasible.\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n-4\n\n\u03c3\n\nquasi-2D\n\n/\u03c3\n\n3D\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\n10 0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n3\n\nl0 (in units of 10 Bohr)\n\nFIG. 4: The ratios of cross sections for elastic scattering (circles) and chemical reaction (triangles) in quasi-2D and 3D\nas functions of the con\u001cnement strength for 7 Li + 6 Li2 (v =\n0, N = 1) collisions. The collision energy is 10\u22128 cm\u22121 .\n\nIn summary, we have developed a formalism for rigorous calculations of cross sections for inelastic and reactive collisions of ultracold atoms and molecules con-\n\n\u001cned in quasi-2D geometry. The approach provides expressions for the inelastic and reactive scattering cross\nsections in terms of the S-matrix elements for collisions\nin 3D and the laser con\u001cnement parameters. We use the\nmethod to elucidate the general features of inelastic scattering and chemical reactions in ultracold quasi-2D gases\nof atoms and molecules. We have found that the cross\nsections for inelastic and chemically reactive collisions are\nsuppressed by the con\u001cnement forces. This suppression\nis generally more signi\u001ccant than the e\u001bect of the laser\ncon\u001cnement on the probability of elastic scattering. The\nelastic-to-inelastic collision ratios are therefore enhanced\nin the presence of a laser con\u001cnement. Our results suggest that applying laser con\u001cnement in one dimension\nmay stabilize ultracold systems. We have found that the\nthreshold energy dependence of cross sections for both\nelastic and inelastic collisions in quasi-2D gases depends\non the scattering length of the collision partners in the\ncon\u001cned state and the con\u001cnement strength so it can be\ntuned by varying the con\u001cnement forces and an external\nmagnetic \u001celd. This can be used to study fundamental physics of threshold collisions and simulate dynamics\nof exotic quantum systems such as exciton polaritons in\ncrystalline organic microcavities [11].\nThe work was supported by NSERC of Canada.\n\n[1] I.
