There has been increasing interest recently\nin studying diluted magnetic semiconductors both experimentally and theoretically [1, 2]. This interest is motivated not\nonly by the possibility of potential technological applications\nof the materials but also by a very rich physics, which follows\nfrom the unique combination of magnetic and semiconductor properties co-existing in diluted magnetic semiconductors.\nThere is a large number of different materials currently being studied such as Ga1\u2212x Mnx As, In1\u2212x Mnx As, Ga1\u2212x Mnx P,\nGa1\u2212x Mn x N, Ge1\u2212x Mnx , etc. One of the common important\nfeatures of these materials is the invariable presence of strong\ndisorder, which plays an essential role in both magnetic and\ntransport properties of the systems with the most prominent\neffect being the localization of carriers. Disorder arises here\nfrom the random locations of magnetic impurities in the host\nlattice of the semiconductor and also from other impurities\nand defects in the system. It is important to emphasize that\ndisorder effects are completely neglected in the continuum virtual crystal approximation often used in the theoretical studies\nof these systems.\nIt is now widely accepted that ferromagnetism in diluted\nmagnetic semiconductors is due to an indirect interaction between magnetic impurities, which is mediated by holes. The\neffective magnetic coupling strongly depends upon the ratio\nn1/3\ni Lloc of the localization radius and the mean distance between the magnetic ions. In the strongly localized regime,\ni.e. when n1/3\ni Lloc \u226a 1, the system may be viewed as a combination of two static magnetic subsystems (magnetic impurities and holes) with the corresponding Hamiltonian having\nthe following form:\nX\nX\n(1)\nJ (|ra \u2212 ri |) Sa \u03c3i +\nJAF (|ra \u2212 rb |) Sa Sb ,\nH=\nia\n\nab\n\nwhere Sa are impurity spins and \u03c3i are hole spins, J(r) is the\nmanganese-hole interaction, which is given by\n!\nr\nJ(r) = J0 exp \u2212\n,\n(2)\nLloc\nand JAF (r) is the direct antiferromagnetic coupling originating\nfrom the exchange interaction of the deep-lying electron states\nof magnetic impurities, which decays exponentially with distance much more rapidly than the manganese-hole coupling\n\n(2). The Hamiltonian (1) leads to a polaron percolation picture [3], which qualitatively explains the mechanism of the\nferromagnetic transition in the system: In diluted magnetic\nsemiconductors, the concentration of holes is much smaller\nthan the one of manganese atoms ni . If T \u226a |J0 |, the magnetic\nimpurities around each localized hole get polarized forming\na bound magnetic polaron. As we lower the temperature, the\npolaron size Rp (T ) increases and polarons overlap forming finite clusters. At some threshold temperature T c , an infinite\ncluster appears signaling the ferromagnetic transition. The direct antiferromagnetic coupling cuts off the polaron growth at\nthe distance R\u2217 = Lloc ln |J0 /JAF (n\u22121/3\n)|, when the manganese\ni\nimpurities prefer the antiferromagnetic alignment to the coupling to a distant hole. If this distance exceeds the polaron size\nat the transition point R\u2217 \u226b Rp (T c ), the antiferromagnetic interaction does not affect the ferromagnetic transition physics\nand can be neglected at T \u223c T c (we accept this assumption in\nthe present paper).\nIt is possible to formalize the polaron picture developed in\nthe paper [3] by deriving the effective Hamiltonian for interacting polarons. This can be achieved (see below) by integrating out the manganese spins. The resulting Hamiltonian (8)\nis the ferromagnetic Heisenberg-type Hamiltonian with small\nlogarithmic \"non-Heisenberg\" corrections, which can be neglected. The corresponding interaction constant depends upon\nthe inter-polaron distance, which is the distance between the\nlocalization centers of the corresponding holes. Since the\nspatial distribution of the holes is the random Poisson distribution, the ferromagnetic polaron coupling becomes a random variable with a well-defined distribution function. This\nmaps the initial problem onto a strongly disordered ferromagnetic Heisenberg model with randomly placed sites. This system naturally leads to the well-known Griffiths-McCoy effects\n[4, 5] in the disordered phase near the phase transition. The\nGriffiths-McCoy singularities are central of the present Letter.\nThe original paper of Griffiths [4] addressed the nature of\nthe transition in a random Ising ferromagnet, although the\nmain conclusions are relevant to much more general systems.\nThe central idea of the Griffiths theory is that above the ferromagnetic transition point in a disordered system, there is\nalways a finite probability of finding an arbitrary large ferromagnetic cluster. These rare-fluctuation clusters give singular\n\n\f2\ncontributions to the magnetization, which can be proven to be\na non-analytic function of the external magnetic field. The\ncorresponding phase is called the Griffiths phase. The statement of the non-analyticity of the magnetization is a purely\nmathematical statement. The corresponding corrections, although singular, are extremely (exponentially) small and it\nis not clear whether such effects in thermodynamic quantities are observable in real experiments. However, the Griffiths effects are much more pronounced in dynamic quantities\nbecause the disorder in the model is quenched (does not depend on time) and thus the rare-fluctuation induced clusters\nare infinitely extended in the time direction. Thus, in the Griffiths phase region, the dynamic response is governed by the\nGriffiths-McCoy effects as was shown in Ref. [6]. Currently\nthere is a great deal of interest in Griffiths physics related to\nquantum phase transitions [7, 8] (a quantum d-dimensional\nsystem is equivalent to a d + 1-dimensional classical systems\nat T = 0; thus, a quantum phase transition in a disordered system is governed by Griffiths-McCoy effects due to disorder\nbeing perfectly correlated in time).\nEffective polaron Hamiltonian. Let us consider two localized holes embedded into the system of impurity spins. Let the\n. The partition function\ninter-hole distance be large: r \u226b n\u22121/3\ni\nfor the system reads:\n(\nY\n1 h\n(3)\nexp \u2212 \u015ca J (|ra \u2212 r1 |) \u03c3\u03021\nZ = Tr\u03c31 ,\u03c32 Tr{Sa }\nT\na\ni)\n+ J (|ra \u2212 r2 |) \u03c3\u03022 .\nIt is important to realize that we are building an effective description in terms of bound magnetic polarons, which are very\n\"heavy\" classical objects, and the impurity spins are generally\nlarge (5/2 for manganese impurities). Thus, we can ignore\nquantum effects and replace the traces in Eq. (3) by the corresponding classical integrals. We rewrite Eq. (3) as\n)\n(\nI\nEeff (cos \u03b8, T )\nd\u03a91 d\u03a92\n,\n(4)\nexp \u2212\nZ=\n4\u03c0 4\u03c0\nT\nwhere integration over \u03a9i implies averaging over the orientation of the ith polaron's spin, \u03b8 is the angle between the spins\nof the two polarons, and the effective interaction is defined as\n[see Eq. (3)]:\n)\nX ( sinh[ J(r\n \u0303 a )/T ]\nln\nEeff (cos \u03b8, T ) = \u2212T\n,\n(5)\n \u0303 a )/T\nJ(r\na\nwith\n\u221a\n \u0303 = J0 2 exp \u2212 r1 + r2\nJ(r)\n2Lloc\n\n!s\n\ncosh\n\n!\nr1 \u2212 r2\n+ cos \u03b8,\nLloc\n\n(6)\n\nwhere r1,2 are the distances between a magnetic impurity and\npolaron centers (localized holes). Taking into account the fact\nthat the density of magnetic impurities is high, we can replace\n\nthe sum in Eq. (5) by the integral:\n#\n\"\nZ\n \u0303\n \u0303 a ) \u2202 J(r)\n\u2202Eeff (cos \u03b8, T )\nJ(r\n3\n= \u2212ni d r tanh\n.\n\u2202 cos \u03b8\nT\n\u2202 cos \u03b8\n\n(7)\n\nIn the limit Lloc \u226a r, we have\nEeff (cos \u03b8, T ) = \u2212\n\n!\n\u0013\nJ02 \u0012 \u03c0 2\nr\nLloc rni exp \u2212\nT 6\nLloc\n\u0014\nT 2Lr \u0015\n\u00d7 ln f (\u03b8) e loc cos \u03b8,\nJ\n\n(8)\n\nwhere f (\u03b8) \u223c 1 is a function of \u03b8, which is always non-zero\nand can be neglected within the logarithmic accuracy. We\nconclude that the effective polaron Hamiltonian is the ferromagnetic exchange Hamiltonian with randomly placed cites\nand the couplings between them exponentially decaying with\ndistance.\nA similar random exchange Hamiltonian was considered by\nKorenblit et al. in Ref. [9], where it was found that the ferromagnetic transition in the system can be conveniently described with the help of the percolation theory. Within the\npercolation approach, two interacting polarons are considered\neither locked in the same direction (if the effective interaction\nis larger than temperature: Jeff > T ) or completely uncorrelated in the opposite limit, Jeff < T (which essentially means\nthat the weak couplings can be set to zero). This means that\nwe replace the initial system of randomly interacting polarons\nby a system in which the weaker couplings are cut. When\ndecreasing temperature, the number of strongly coupled polarons increases and at some temperature, an infinite cluster\nappears. This temperature is identified with the ferromagnetic\ntransition temperature of the system. We would like to emphasize that the percolation theory is able to establish T c only\nup to a numeric factor of the order of unity. In the immediate\nvicinity of the ferromagnetic transition point, the percolation\ntheory may fail since it is not able to account for critical fluctuations, which become increasingly important at T \u2192 T c .\nHowever, there is a small parameter in our theory, namely\nn1/3\nh Lloc \u226a 1. The parameter p of the percolation theory is\nrelated to temperature by\n\u0012J \u0013\n0\np(T ) \u2261 n1/3\nL\nln\n,\n(9)\nloc\nh\nT\nwith pc \u2248 0.86. Thus there exists a domain 1 \u226b |p \u2212 pc |/pc \u226b\nn1/3\nh Lloc , which is outside the thermodynamic critical region\n|T \u2212 T c |/T c \u226a 1, but still close to the percolation transition,\nwhere we can use the asymptotic results of the percolation\ntheory.\nGriffiths theorem. Let us prove the existence of the Griffiths phase in the framework of the percolation theory. In the\npercolation picture, we have a number of finite clusters above\nthe transition point. The concentration of clusters containing\nN polarons for N \u226b \u03be D is [8, 10]\n\uf8ee\n!\u03c4\u2212\u03b8\n!\u03b6 \uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\nN \uf8fa\uf8fa\nN\n(10)\nexp \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\u2212A D \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb ,\nP(N, T ) \u221d N \u2212\u03c4 D\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\n\f3\nwhere N is the number of polarons in a cluster, \u03be \u221d\n(|p(T ) \u2212 pc | /pc )\u2212\u03bd is the dimensionless correlation length.\nPercolation exponents are as follows\n\u03c4 \u2248 2.18, \u03bd \u2248 0.88,\n\nT > T c : \u03b6 = 1, \u03b8 = 3/2, D = 2,\nT < T c : \u03b6 = 2/3, \u03b8 = \u22121/9, D = 3\n\n(11a)\n(11b)\n(11c)\n\nfor the three-dimensional percolation.

[11], we obtain the radius of convergence RH\nof the series:\n!\nT\naN\u22121\nRH =\nlim\nS p N\u2192+\u221e aN\n!\n1\n2\u03c0T\nlim N \u22121/\u03b6 = 0.\n= \u03b6\u03b6\nS p N\u2192\u221e\nAbove the percolation threshold, \u03b6 = 1 and the series (13) has\nzero radius of convergence, which implies the non-analyticity\nof the magnetization as a function of the external magnetic\nfield due to rare disorder fluctuations, i.e. the essential Griffiths singularity. The corresponding singularity in the magnetization and susceptibility is however very weak:\n\u0014\n\u0012 T \u0013\u0015\n,\n(14)\nM(H) \u221d exp \u2212const\nH\n\nwhich is typical for the Griffiths effects on thermodynamic\nquantities in classical systems.\nDynamic susceptibility. The Griffiths physics manifests itself much stronger in dynamic quantities. The quantity of interest is the dynamic susceptibility, which is connected with\nthe spin-spin autocorrelation function\nC(t) =\n\n1 X\nhSa (t)Sa (0)i .\nVni a\n\nThe relaxation of the magnetic moment in a cluster is governed by the Gilbert equation:\n(\n)\n\u2202m\n\u2202F\n\u2202m\n= \u03b3m \u00d7 \u2212\n\u2212\u03b7\n+ h(t) ,\n(17)\n\u2202t\n\u2202m\n\u2202t\nwhere \u03b3 and \u03b7 are constants corresponding to the gyromagnetic ratio and Gilbert damping and m = M/VN , is the magnetization density with VN being the volume of the cluster\nVN = Nv p = N(4\u03c0/3)L3loc ln3 (J0 /T ). Function F (m) is the\nfree energy of the cluster per volume as a function of the direction of the magnetic moment, and h(t) is the fluctuating\nmagnetic field. Let us note that the case of h = 0 and F (m) =\n\u2212Hm yields the well-known Landau-Lifshitz equations [12]\nwith the dimensionless damping coefficient \u03b1 = \u03b7\u03b3m. We\nassume that anisotropy of the cluster is weak enough so that\nparameter [VN (Fmax \u2212 Fmin ) /T ] is very small, which corresponds to the superparamagnetic limit.\nThe random magnetic field h(t) is due to thermal fluctuations. They are supposed to be Gaussian, with the following\nwhite-noise correlation functions:\nD\nE\nhh(t)i = 0 and h\u03b1 (t)h\u03b2 (0) = \u03bc\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(t),\n(18)\n\nwhere Greek indices label Cartesian coordinates. It is possible\n(see Ref. [13]) to connect the constant \u03bc with the properties\nof the cluster and temperature. To do so, one imposes the\nnatural condition that the stationary solution of the stochastic\nGilbert equation (17) subject to the thermal noise (18) reduces\nto the Boltzmann equilibrium distribution for the magnetization density: m(\u03b8, \u03c6) \u221d exp[\u2212VN F (\u03b8, \u03c6)/T ]. This leads to the\nfollowing expression for the constant in the correlator (18):\n\u03bc = 2\u03b7T/VN .\nIt is further possible to derive general Fokker-Planck equations for the distribution function of the magnetic moment\nP[m; t] in the case of an arbitrary anisotropy F (m) (this was\ndone in the pioneering paper of Brown [13]). We however\nconfine ourself to studying the isotropic case only when the\nFokker-Planck equation reduces to the simple diffusion equation on a sphere (also described phenomenologically by Bray\nin Ref. [6]):\n#\n\"\n\u2202\n(19)\n\u2212 D\u2206\u03b8,\u03c6 P[m, t] = 0,\n\u2202t\n\nwhere \u2206\u03b8,\u03c6 is the angular part of the Laplacian and the effective diffusion coefficient is equal to (see e.g. Ref. [13])\n\n(15)\n\nIn the Griffiths phase, the disorder-averaged correlator can be\nwritten as follows [6, 8]:\nX\nC(t) =\nP(N)C N (t),\n(16)\nN\n\nwhere C N (t) is a function describing the relaxation of the magnetic moment of a cluster of size N.\n\nD(N, T ) =\n\n3 1 \u0012 \u03b1\u03b3 \u0013 T\n1 1\n,\n4\u03c0 S 1 + \u03b12 ln3 J0 ni L3loc N\nT\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the dimensionless damping coefficient introduced\nin the previous paragraph, \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio, and S\nis the magnetic impurity spin.\nLet us suppose that the initial magnetization m(t = 0) of the\ncluster is in the z-direction, which corresponds to the initial\ncondition P[\u03b8, \u03c6; t = 0] = \u03b4(\u03b8) for the distribution function,\n\n\f4\ndefining the Green function for the diffusion equation (19).\nThe corresponding solution reads:\nP[\u03b8; t] =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nl+\n\nl=0\n\n!\n1\nPl (cos \u03b8) exp [\u2212Dl(l + 1)t] sin \u03b8, (21)\n2\n\nwhere Pl (*) are Legendre polynomials. The z-component of\nthe magnetization averaged over the distribution function (21)\nis exactly the function C N (t) introduced in Eq. (16), which\ndescribes the relaxation of the magnetic moment in a cluster\nof size N:\nC N (t) = M exp [\u22122D(N, T )t] ,\n\n(22)\n\nWe now proceed to calculate the spin autocorrelation function by replacing the sum in Eq. (16) by the integral\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n!\u03b6\nZ+\u221e\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\nN 1\u2212\u03b8\nN\nC(t) \u221d dN d(\u03c4\u2212\u03b8) exp \uf8ef\uf8f0\u2212A d \u2212 2D(N, T )t\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb ,\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\n(23)\n\n0\n\nwhich can be evaluated by the saddle point approximation:\n!a\n!c #\n\"\np(T ) \u2212 pc \u2206\np(T ) \u2212 pc b\nt exp \u2212g(T )\nt , (24)\nC(t) \u221d\npc\npc\n\n1) must be in the Griffiths phase in the vicinity the ferromagnetic transition point. The magnetization is a non-analytic\nfunction of the external magnetic field with the corresponding singularity being exponentially small. The dynamic response in the vicinity of the transition point is determined by\nrare-fluctuation Griffiths droplets. These droplets correspond\nto the percolating clusters in the polaron percolation picture.\nThe dynamic susceptibility has the form (24) of the stretched\nexponential ln C(t) \u221d \u2212t\u2206 , with \u2206 being connected to the percolation indices and equal to 1/2 in the Griffiths phase and\n2/5 in the ferromagnetic phase. An important consequence\nof our work relates to the role of disorder in ferromagnetic\nsemiconductors. Since disorder is fundamental to the occurrence of Griffiths phase, an observation of Griffiths physics in\ndiluted magnetic semiconductors will have significance with\nrespect to the role of quenched disorder in these systems. In\nfact, we believe that insulating diluted magnetic semiconductors (e.g., GaMnAs or InMnAs on the insulating side of the\nmetal-insulator transition) may be an ideal system to look for\nsignatures of evasive Griffiths physics.\nThis work was supported by the US-ONR, LPS, and\nDARPA.
