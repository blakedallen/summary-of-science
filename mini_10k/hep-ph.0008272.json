Introduction\n\nthe matrix elements:\n\nWe study matrix elements of bilinear quark\ncurrents, that are parametrised by form factors,\nencoding the (long-distance) strong interaction\neffects in exclusive, semi-leptonic or radiative B\ndecays, such as B \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd, B \u2192 K \u2217 \u03b3 etc. They\nalso appear as non-perturbative parameters in the\nfactorisation theorem for non-leptonic B decays\nin the heavy quark mass limit [1]. The knowledge\nof these form factors therefore helps to determine\nthe CKM coupling |Vub |, and to predict CP violating asymmetries and other quantities in rare\nB decays.\nCharles et al. have shown that certain symmetries apply, when the momentum of the final\nlight meson is large [2]. These symmetries reduce\nthe number of independent form factors, but they\nare broken by radiative corrections. In this contribution, which is based on work done together\nwith Martin Beneke [3], we give a brief derivation\nof the symmetry relations and then discuss the\ncomputation of symmetry-breaking corrections at\nfirst order in the strong coupling constant \u03b1s .\n\nhP (p\u2032 )|q\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bc b|B\u0304(p)i =\n\u0015\n\u0014\nM 2 \u2212m2P \u03bc\n2\n\u03bc\n\u2032\u03bc\nq +\nf+ (q ) p + p \u2212\nq2\nM 2 \u2212m2P \u03bc\nq ,\nf0 (q 2 )\nq2\n\n2. Large-recoil symmetries\nLet us concentrate on the form factors for B\u0304\ndecays into a pseudoscalar meson. They are defined by the following Lorentz decompositions of\n\u2217 Contribution\n\nto IV.

Heavy-heavy decays\nAs long as the velocity transfer to the D meson remains of order 1, we may assume that the\nheavy quarks interact with the spectator quark\n(and other soft degrees of freedom) exclusively\nvia soft gluon exchanges characterised by momentum transfers much smaller than the heavy\nquark masses. Any hard interaction would imply large momentum of the spectator quark in\nthe B meson or D meson or both, and such a\nconfiguration is assumed to be highly improbable.\nThe simplifications that occur when heavy quarks\ninteract only with soft gluons are formalised as\nheavy quark effective theory (HQET) (see e.g.\nRef. [4] and references therein) which implies the\n\n\f2\nwell-known spin and heavy flavour symmetries in\nthe infinite quark mass limit [5]. A consequence\nof these symmetries is that all form factors are\nrelated to a single function of velocity transfer,\n\u03be(v * v \u2032 ), whose absolute normalisation is known\nat zero recoil (\u03be(1) = 1). The heavy quark symmetries are violated by radiative corrections (as\nwell as higher dimension operators in the effective\nLagrangian), such as the one shown in Fig. 1b.\nThe symmetry breaking effects are caused only by\nthe short-distance part of Fig. 1b. They are accounted for by multiplicatively renormalising the\nheavy quark current in HQET.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nLet us consider the large recoil limit and assume\nthat the b quark and the energetic light quark,\ncreated in the heavy-to-light transition, interact\nwith the spectator quark (and other soft degrees\nof freedom) exclusively via soft gluon exchanges.\nWe may then continue to exploit the heavy quark\nsymmetries for the b quark. A similar simplification occurs for the light quark. To leading order in \u039bQCD /E, the interaction of light energetic\nquarks with soft gluons can be described by an\neffective Lagrangian [6,2],\nn/+\n(i n\u2212 * D) qn + O(1/E) ,\n(3)\n2\nwhere n\u03bc\u00b1 are two light-like vectors (n+ * n\u2212 = 2),\nand qn (x) = eiE(n\u2212 *x) n/\u22124n/+ q(x). In the limit\nE \u2192 \u221e the Lagrangian (3) leads to new symmetries that, combined with the heavy-quark symmetries, imply non-trivial relations between the\nsoft contributions to the form factors [2]. Using\ntechniques familiar from HQET, we find\n\u0003\n\u0002\nhP (p\u2032 )|q\u0304n \u0393 bv |B\u0304(p)i = tr AP (E) ML \u0393 MB (4)\nLeff = q\u0304n\n\nwhere\nMP\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nIn the HQET formalism the hard contributions\nfrom Fig. 1c,d are assumed to be suppressed exponentially by the B and D meson wave functions. As we shall see, a non-vanishing contribution from \"hard spectator interactions\" is one\nof the main differences between heavy-light and\nheavy-heavy form factors at large recoil.\n2.2. Heavy-light decays\nThe recoil energy of the light meson, E =\n(M 2 \u2212 q 2 )/(2M ), is of order M/2 if the momentum transfer is small, q 2 \u226a M 2 (here and in the\nfollowing we have approximated p\u20322 = m2P \u2243 0).\n\nn/+ n/\u2212\n,\n4\n\n1 + v/\n(\u2212\u03b35 ) ,\n(5)\n2\nwith p\u03bc \u2243 M v \u03bc , p\u2032\u03bc \u2243 En\u03bc\u2212 . The most general\nform of the function AP (E) is\n\nMB\nFigure 1. Different contributions to the B \u2192\nP (V ) transition. (a) Soft contribution (soft interactions with the spectator antiquark are not\ndrawn). (b) Hard vertex renormalisation. (c,d)\nHard spectator interaction.\n\n= (\u2212\u03b35 )\n=\n\nAP (E)\n\n= 2E \u03beP (E),\n\n(6)\n\nwith a conveniently chosen overall normalisation.\nIt follows that the three pseudoscalar meson form\nfactors are all related to a single function \u03beP (E).\n(Analogously, the seven form factors for decays\ninto light vector mesons can be expressed in\nterms of only two unknown functions, \u03be\u22a5 (E) and\n\u03bek (E), see also Ref. [2].) Performing the trace\nin Eq. (4), and comparing with the form factor\ndefinition (1,2), we obtain, for instance,\nf+ (q 2 ) =\n\nM\nM\nfT (q 2 ) = \u03beP (E)\nf0 (q 2 ) =\n2E\nM + mP\n(7)\n\nThere is an important distinction between the\neffective Lagrangian for heavy quarks and for energetic light quarks. A configuration where one\n\n\f3\nlight quark carries most of the energy is atypical.\nTherefore the symmetries of the interaction are\nnot realised in the hadronic spectrum. Furthermore, the probability that such an asymmetric\nparton configuration hadronises into a light meson depends on the energy of the meson. Hence,\nthe soft contributions to the form factors are\nenergy-dependent functions, whose absolute normalisation is not known. This is to be contrasted to the case of heavy-heavy form factors,\nfor which the spin symmetry relates pseudoscalar\nand vector mesons, and the Isgur-Wise form factor \u03be(v * v \u2032 ) is independent of the heavy quark\nmass. The scaling law for the soft contribution\ncan be derived in different ways, but all of them\nmake use of the endpoint behaviour of the pion's\nlight-cone distribution amplitude [7]. If one assumes that the distribution amplitude vanishes\nlinearly with the longitudinal momentum fraction of the spectator quark, as is suggested by\nits asymptotic form, one finds\n3/2\n\n\u03beP (E) \u223c\n\nM 1/2 \u039bQCD\nE2\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nAs in the case of a heavy-to-heavy transition,\nthere will be a vertex correction to Eq. (7) (of\nthe type shown at one loop in Fig. 1b). The hard\npart of these diagrams does not respect the symmetry relations, but it can be accounted for in\nperturbation theory by multiplicatively renormalising the heavy-to-light current just as in the case\nof a heavy-to-heavy transition.\nThe important new element of the discussion is\nprovided by hard spectator interaction in Figs. 1c\nand 1d. This allows the light meson to be formed\nin a preferred configuration, in which the momentum is distributed nearly equally between the two\nquarks. Since both quarks have momentum of order M , and the gluon in Figs. 1c and 1d has virtuality of order (M \u039bQCD ), this contribution can be\ncomputed within the hard-scattering approach to\nexclusive processes [7\u20139]. The resulting scaling\nbehaviour for the pseudoscalar meson form factors is (see, for instance, Refs. [9,10])\np\nfi hard (q 2 \u2243 0) \u223c \u03b1s ( M \u039bQCD )\n\n\u0010\u039b\n\nQCD\n\nM\n\n\u00113/2\n\n. (9)\n\nWe can summarise this discussion by the following factorisation formula for a heavy-light form\nfactor at large recoil, and at leading order in 1/M :\nfi (q 2 )\n\n= Ci \u03beP (E) + \u03a6B \u2297 Ti \u2297 \u03a6P ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere i = {+, 0, T }. Analogous formulas hold for\nthe form factors that parametrise the decays into\nlight vector mesons [3]. Here \u03beP (E) is the soft\npart of the form factor, to which the symmetries\ndiscussed above apply; Ti is a hard-scattering kernel (with the endpoint divergence regulated in a\ncertain manner), convoluted with the light-cone\ndistribution amplitudes of the B meson and the\nlight pseudoscalar meson; Ci contains the hard\nvertex renormalisation. Eq. (9) implies that the\nhard spectator interaction (Figs. 1c and 1d) is\nsuppressed by one power of \u03b1s relative to the soft\ncontribution (Fig. 1a). Hence the form factor relations like Eq. (7) are indeed correct at leading\norder in 1/M and \u03b1s .\nWe are going to calculate the order \u03b1s corrections to Eq. (7) in the full theory and identify the\nsoft contributions to be absorbed into \u03beP . We\nwill not explicitly match the effective theory onto\nQCD, but, instead, define a factorisation scheme\nby imposing the convenient condition\nf+ \u2261 \u03beP .\n\n(11)\n\nIn this way, also some hard contributions are absorbed into \u03beP . In particular, we circumvent some\nsubtleties, arising in the effective theory defined\nby Eq. (3), that have been addressed in [11].\n3.

(10,11) this\nyields (\u03a6B \u2297 T+ \u2297 \u03a6P \u2261 0)\n\u03a6B \u2297 T 0 \u2297 \u03a6P =\n\n\u03b1s CF q 2\n\u2206FP ,\n4\u03c0 2EM\n\n\u03a6B \u2297 T T \u2297 \u03a6P = \u2212\n\n\u03b1s CF M + mP\n\u2206FP ,\n4\u03c0\n2E\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nwhere we have defined the abbreviation\n\u2206FP \u2261\n\n8\u03c0 2 fB fP \u22121\nhl+ iB h\u016b\u22121 iP .\nNC M\n\n(16)\n\nHere l+ is the light-cone plus component of the\n\u22121\nspectator quark in the B meson, and hl+\niB the\ncorresponding moment with its light-cone distribution amplitude. The same moment appears\nin the leading-order contribution to B \u2192 l\u03bd\u03b3\ndecays [12], and determines the leading nonfactorisable corrections to B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays [1].\nThe moment h\u016b\u22121 iP , with \u016b being the longitudinal momentum fraction of the spectator quark in\nthe light meson, is accessible, for instance, from\nthe analysis of P \u03b3 transition form factors, see, for\ninstance, the review in Ref. [13].\nAnalogous results are found for the form factors\nthat parametrise decays into light vector mesons\n[3]. We quote only one example that is important\nfor the analysis of the forward-backward asymmetry zero in the rare decay B \u2192 K \u2217 l+ l\u2212 . The\nform factor ratios that enter the relation between\nthe Wilson coefficients C7eff and C9eff [14,15] receive the following \u03b1s correction\nT2\nM\nM + mV T 1\n=\n=\nM\nV\nM + mV A1\n\u03b1s CF\n\u03b1s CF M \u2206F\u22a5\nM2\n1+\n(17)\n[ln 2 \u2212 L] +\n4\u03c0\n\u03bc\n4\u03c0 4E \u03be\u22a5\nwhere a similar quantity as in Eq. (16),\n\u2206F\u22a5 \u2261\n\n8\u03c0 2 fB f\u22a5 \u22121\nhl+ iB h\u016b\u22121 i\u22a5 ,\nNC M\n\n(18)\n\nenters, with h\u016b\u22121 i\u22a5 being a moment of the distribution amplitude of a transversely polarised vector meson. Inserting standard values for the parameters in Eqs. (17,18), the \u03b1s corrections in\nEq. (17) amount to about 5%.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that, in the kinematic region where the momentum transfer to the\nlight meson is large, heavy-to-light form factors\ncan be described by a factorisation formula (10)\nwhich is based on the symmetries that arise in the\nlarge-recoil/heavy-quark limit. This implies that\n\u03b1s corrections to symmetry relations are calculable in a systematic way: i) Vertex corrections\nto the heavy-to-light current can be treated in an\nanalogous way as in heavy quark effective theory.\nii) Hard rescattering with the spectator quark is\ndescribed by the hard-scattering approach which\ninvolves light-cone distribution amplitudes of the\nparticipating mesons. Typically, to first order in\nthe strong coupling constant, these corrections\namount to a few percent. Further details can be\nfound in Ref. [3].\nREFERENCES\n1. M. Beneke et al., Phys. Rev.
