Our purpose is to investigate the idea that Complex C is surrounded by an envelope\nof highly ionized material, arising from the interaction between the cloud and a hot surrounding medium.\nWe measure column densities of high-velocity high ion absorption, and compare the kinematics of low,\nintermediate, and high ionization gas along the five sight lines. We find that in all five cases, the H I\nand O VI high-velocity components are centered within 20 km s\u22121 of one another, with an average\ndisplacement of < v\u0304O VI \u2212 v\u0304H I >= 3 \u00b1 12 km s\u22121 . In those directions where the H I emission extends to\nmore negative velocities (the so-called high-velocity ridge), so does the O VI absorption. The kinematics\nof Si II are also similar to those of O VI, with < v\u0304O VI \u2212 v\u0304Si II >= 0\u00b115 km s\u22121 . We compare our high ion\ncolumn density ratios to the predictions of various models, adjusted to account for both recent updates to\nthe solar elemental abundances, and for the relative elemental abundance ratios in Complex C. Along the\nPG 1259+593 sight line, we measure N (Si IV)/N (O VI) = 0.10 \u00b1 0.02, N (C IV)/N (O VI) = 0.35+0.05\n\u22120.06 ,\nand N (N V)/N (O VI) < 0.07 (3\u03c3). These ratios are inconsistent with collisional ionization equilibrium\nat one kinetic temperature. Photoionization by the extragalactic background is ruled out as the source of\nthe high ions since the path lengths required would make HVCs unreasonably large; photoionization by\nradiation from the disk of the Galaxy also appears unlikely since the emerging photons are not energetic\nenough to produce O VI. By themselves, ionic ratios are insufficient to discriminate between various\nionization models, but by considering the absorption kinematics as well we consider the most likely\norigin for the highly ionized high-velocity gas to be at the conductive or turbulent interfaces between\nthe neutral/warm ionized components of Complex C and a surrounding hot medium. The presence of\ninterfaces on the surface of HVCs provides indirect evidence for the existence of a hot medium in which\nthe HVCs are immersed. This medium could be a hot (T & 106 K) extended Galactic corona or hot gas\nin the Local Group.\nSubject headings: Galaxy: halo \u2013 ISM: clouds \u2013 ISM: kinematics and dynamics \u2013 ultraviolet: ISM\nof high-velocity C IV in the spectra of Mrk 509 and\nPKS 2155\u2013304 (Sembach et al. 1995, 1999). Following\nthe launch of the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer\n(FUSE ) satellite in the summer of 1999, O VI has been\nrepeatedly detected in absorption in HVCs; the first highvelocity O VI results were reported by Sembach et al.\n(2000) and Murphy et al. (2000). More recently, a survey\nof high-velocity O VI has been completed by Sembach et\nal. (2003a, hereafter S03). Since O VI is an ion that exists\nat temperatures of a few \u00d7105 K (Sutherland & Dopita\n1993), its presence in HVCs poses a variety of intriguing\nquestions: primarily, what physical process produces the\nO VI? Does the ion originate at some form of interface between the neutral and warm ionized components of HVCs\nand a surrounding hot medium? Can photoionization by\nthe hard extragalactic radiation field play an important\nrole? S03 began to address these issues with a study of\n102 sight lines, 58 of which displayed high-velocity O VI\n\n1. introduction\n\nComplex C is an extensive high-velocity cloud (HVC)\ncovering 1700 square degrees in the northern Galactic sky\nand falling at an average LSR velocity of \u2212130 km s\u22121 onto\nthe Milky Way. Because of its low metallicity (\u2248 0.1 \u2212 0.2\nsolar), Complex C is suspected of comprising either intergalactic gas or material tidally stripped from a nearby\ngalaxy, with perhaps some contribution from upwelling\nGalactic outflow. HVCs are defined as clouds whose observed radial velocities deviate significantly with those expected from Galactic rotation, corresponding in practice\nto clouds with |vLSR | > 100 km s\u22121 . They have traditionally been studied in neutral hydrogen 21 cm emission, and\nmore recently with both H\u03b1 emission measurements and\nabsorption line studies.\nUntil 1995, all the absorption detected in HVCs had\nbeen in lines of neutral or low ionization species. Highly\nionized gas was then discovered with the detections\n1\n\nBased on observations from the NASA-CNES-CSA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer mission, operated by Johns Hopkins University,\nsupported by NASA contract NAS 5-32985, and from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science\nInstitute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.\n2 Department of Astronomy, University of Wisconsin - Madison, 475 North Charter St., Madison, WI 53706\n3 Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri, Largo E.

Our approach is to\ncompare the kinematics and column densities of high and\nlow ion absorption in high-velocity gas. Clues concerning the physical conditions within the absorbing material\nare provided by observing the extent and structure of the\nabsorption profiles in different species.\nIn Figure 1 we show a color map of Complex C from\nthe Dwingeloo HVC survey (Hulsbosch & Wakker 1988),\ndisplaying the velocity structure within the complex. Gas\ncovering a range in velocities of \u2248 100 km s\u22121 is present in\nComplex C. The observed range in column densities and\nvelocities indicates a complex system with a large amount\nof sub-structure. The sight lines studied in this paper are\nmarked with stars.\nOur paper is structured as follows: In \u00a72 we give a brief\nsummary of previous studies of Complex C. Section 3 contains a description of our observations and data reduction.\nWe present spectroscopic measurements of high-velocity,\nhighly ionized absorption in \u00a74. In \u00a75 we display our spectra and compare the high and low ion absorption along five\nComplex C sight lines. In \u00a76 we discuss and review various\nmodels that might explain the existence of highly ionized\ngas in HVCs. In \u00a77 we discuss the influence of non-solar\nabundance patterns on the model predictions. The theories are compared with our observations in \u00a78, using ionic\nratios and kinematic information. We mention interesting\nresults from sight lines passing near to Complex C in \u00a79.\nOur results are summarized in \u00a710.\n2. previous studies of complex c\n\nDetailed abundances studies of Complex C have been\ncarried out by a number of authors (Wakker et al. 1999;\nRichter et al. 2001a; Gibson et al. 2001; Collins, Shull, &\nGiroux 2003a; Tripp et al. 2003; Sembach et al. 2003b),\nwho have all used HST and FUSE spectroscopy to determine column densities of various ionic species through\nthe complex, and combined them with H I 21 cm emission measurements to derive elemental abundances. These\nstudies have found values of (O I/H I) between 0.09 and\n0.25 times solar, and no evidence for depletion onto dust.\nPrecise measurements are difficult because of a number of\nsources of error, particularly uncertain ionization corrections, the difficulty of measuring a precise b value, and the\nfact that H I radio emission measurements sample a beam\nfar larger than that probed in absorption measurements.\nRelative elemental abundance ratios are important in\nunderstanding the history of Complex C. Russell & Dopita\n(1992) find that in the Magellanic Clouds log (N/O)LMC =\n\u22121.21 and log (N/O)SMC = \u22121.40, and Kobulnicky &\nSkillman (1996) found that log (N/O) typically lies between \u22121.7 and \u22121.5 in dwarf galaxies with log AO < \u22124.0.\nAn observed value in Complex C is log (N/O) = \u22121.7\n(Collins et al. 2003a, towards PG 1259+593), in line with\nthese measurements in other locations7 .\nA conclusive direct distance determination would be an\n7\n8\n\ninvaluable piece of information in studying Complex C; unfortunately, such a determination is difficult to make. The\nstrongest constraint that exists is a lower limit of 6.1 kpc\n(Wakker 2001), based upon the non-detection of Ca II in\nabsorption towards stars at known distances lying in this\npart of the sky. Note, however, that this non-detection is\nnot strongly significant (as defined by Wakker 2001). A\nmore reliable lower limit to the distance is 1.3 kpc.\nIt has been suggested that HVCs may represent material\ntaking part in a Galactic fountain (Shapiro & Field 1976;\nBregman 1980). However, the low metallicities observed\nmake this scenario unlikely for Complex C, since fountain\ngas, having been blown out of the disk by Type II supernovae, should have solar or super-solar rather than subsolar abundances, and a solar N/O ratio of log (N/O)\u2299 =\n\u22120.8. Substantial dilution by primordial gas would be necessary to bring fountain gas down to the observed level of\nmetallicity. We note that the approximately solar abundances measured in intermediate velocity clouds (IVCs;\nRichter et al. 2001a) suggest they are formed by Galactic\nmaterial; it is the IVCs that are consequently thought to\nbe tracing the fountain circulation.\n3. observations and data reduction\n\nThe FUSE satellite (Moos et al. 2000) operates in the\nfar-ultraviolet wavelength regime between 905 and 1187 \u00c5,\nproviding medium resolution (R \u2248 15, 000, corresponding\nto \u2248 20 km s\u22121 FWHM) spectra with enough sensitivity that faint extragalactic sources can be observed. The\nFUSE data analyzed in this paper were obtained from the\nMultimission Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute (MAST)8 .\nIn order to investigate the highly ionized gas in Complex C, we took all the sight lines through Complex C observed with the FUSE satellite and applied a set of selection criteria to identify those directions containing useful\nhigh ion information. These criteria took the form of a series of constraints, that eventually left us with our sample.\nTo be classified as going through Complex C, we required\nthat a sight line had to lie within the 2\u00d71018 cm\u22122 contour\nof N (H I) in the Hulsbosch & Wakker (1988) Dwingeloo\nHVC survey. Constraint 1 eliminated sight lines with poor\nsignal-to-noise, i.e. S/N < 5 near 1030 \u00c5 in the 10-pixelrebinned FUSE spectrum. Constraint 2 looked for sight\nlines with good O VI data, and rejected those with blending or continuum placement problems. Finally, Constraint\n3 looked for sight lines that have been observed with either the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS)\nor the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on\nHST, at better than 30 km s\u22121 resolution. Those that were\nnot were eliminated. The reason for Constraint 3 is that\nwith HST data we can form ionic ratios with O VI, or\nat least upper limits, to investigate the ionization mechanism. Such an approach cannot be achieved with FUSE\ndata alone. Applying these conditions generated our sample of five sight lines, namely Mrk 279, Mrk 817, Mrk 876,\nPG 1259+593, and PG 1351+640, each of which have good\nFUSE and HST data. Of our chosen five sight lines, two\n(Mrk 279 and Mrk 817) have GHRS spectra of the region near 1240 \u00c5, where the N V doublet lies, and three\n\nThroughout this paper we use the conventions [X/Y] = log(NX /NY )\u2212log(NX /NY )\u2299 , (X/Y) = NX /NY , AX = (X/H), and A\u2299\nX = (X/H)\u2299 .\nOnline at http://archive.stsci.edu/mast.html\n\n\fHighly Ionized Gas Surrounding Complex C\n(Mrk 876, PG 1259+593 and PG 1351+640) have STIS\nspectra covering this region. In the case of PG 1259+593,\nwe were also able to use STIS data of Si IV, C IV, and various low-ionization species. Consequently, this remains the\nsight line for which we have the best quality data available,\nand the strongest insight into ionization processes.\nA summary of basic target data is given in Table 1,\nwhere for each sight line we include Galactic longitude l,\nGalactic latitude b, redshift of source z, type of source,\napparent B magnitude of source, Galactic foreground interstellar reddening E(B\u2212V ), high-velocity neutral hydrogen column density N (H I), heliocentric to LSR velocity\ncorrection \u2206vLSR , and recent measurements of [O/H] and\n[N/H] in Complex C by Collins et al. (2003a).\nIn the following two subsections we describe our data\nhandling procedures for our two separate datasets.\n3.1. FUSE\nDetails of our FUSE observations are given in Table 2. The data were reduced using the data reduction\npipeline CALFUSE v2.1.6, except for Mrk 279, for which\nwe used v2.0.5. This anomaly was because of compatibility problems between early FUSE datasets (such as\nthe Mrk 279 observations) and the newer versions of the\nCALFUSE pipeline. The difference in velocity calibration\ncaused by this inconsistency is expected to be minimal,\nsince all CALFUSE versions after 2.0 have greatly improved\nvelocity scale accuracy over earlier ones.\nDespite the improvements made in the calibration software, we still found it necessary to apply velocity shifts to\neach spectrum to register the velocity scale correctly. Our\napproach was to tie the Si II \u03bb1020.699, C II \u03bb1036.337,\nO I \u03bb1039.230, and Ar I \u03bb1048.220 absorption lines to the\ncenters of emission observed in H I, using Effelsberg 100 m\nradio telescope 21 cm observations. This process transforms the velocity scale into the Local Standard of Rest\n(LSR) frame. After using Gaussian component fitting software to measure the velocity centroids of components in\nneutral gas absorption lines, we determined the velocity\ncorrection necessary to align these components with the\ncorresponding components seen in H I. Where possible,\nwe tied the scale to the high-velocity components of H I,\nsince these velocities were often cleaner and more distinct,\nand hence easier to measure. The actual lines used for\nalignment in each case depended on the individual spectrum. We checked for velocity scale differences between\ndifferent channels and different exposures within the same\nchannel. The shifts we applied were all in the range 10\nto 50 km s\u22121 . The Effelsberg 100 m radio telescope has a\nbeam size of 9\u2032.7, and a velocity resolution of \u2248 1 km s\u22121 ;\nthe H I observations we used are described in detail in\nWakker et al. (2001).\nOur alignment procedure has the advantage that H I\nspectra are extremely reliable in their velocity calibration,\nsince radio frequencies can be measured with very high\nprecision. Additionally, when observing an H I spectrum\ntowards an extragalactic source, one has the advantage of\nknowing that the source is beyond the emitting gas, so absorption lines and emission lines can be reliably compared.\nThus the only potential source of errors in our alignment\nprocess are the assumptions that the neutral ions trace\nthe H I, and that emission measurements extending over\n\n3\n\nthe radio telescope beam of ten arcminutes can be safely\ncompared to absorption measurements sampled over an effectively infinitesimally small beam equal to the angular\nsize of the AGN. In light of these concerns, we estimate\nan error of 5 km s\u22121 in our FUSE velocities after alignment. A detailed discussion of velocity calibration issues\nin FUSE spectra, and how to deal with them, is given in\nWakker et al. (2003).\nSince each pixel on the FUSE detectors has a velocity\nwidth of \u2248 2 km s\u22121 , but the instrumental resolution is\nonly \u2248 20 km s\u22121 (FWHM), the data from the instrument are highly oversampled, and so we have rebinned\neach spectrum by five pixels (i.e. to \u2248 10 km s\u22121 bins) to\nobtain the versions displayed and measured in this paper.\nWe fit continua to our spectra using low order (n = 1 \u2212 3)\nLegendre polynomials over \u2248 5 \u00c5 regions on either side of\neach line under study.\nThe primary focus of our investigation is O VI\n\u03bb1031.926, since the presence of transition-temperature\ngas in high-velocity clouds has only recently been discovered. Absorption from C II\u2217 \u03bb1037.018 is responsible for\nblending with high-velocity (Complex C) absorption from\nthe weak O VI line, at 1037.627 \u00c5; we therefore do not\ninclude measurements of the weak O VI line in this work.\nWe also study Si II \u03bb1020.699, C II \u03bb1036.337, and Ar I\n\u03bb1048.220. The C II line is very strong, and although this\ntypically leads to saturation in the line center, the high\nsensitivity in the wings helps to reveal the full extent of\nthe neutral gas absorption; the H I 21 cm line is not sensitive to these lower column density regions. Unfortunately,\nwe could make no clean observation of C III \u03bb977.020, a\ntracer of intermediate-ionization gas, at Complex C velocities, because the C III line is blended below \u2212100 km s\u22121\nby zero velocity absorption from O I \u03bb976.448. The same\nblending problem afflicts high-velocity absorption by Fe III\n\u03bb1122.524, this time by Fe II \u03bb1121.975. Although C III\nor Fe III are stronger and hence more preferable tracers\nof intermediate-ionization gas, we do include profiles of\nS III \u03bb1012.495, to trace the kinematics of this phase of\ninterstellar gas.\nThe strength of contamination from molecular hydrogen\nvaried between our five sight lines. The H2 (6\u20130) P(3) line\nat 1031.191 \u00c5 is the offending line, since in the rest frame of\nO VI \u03bb1031.926 it has a velocity of \u2212213.5 km s\u22121 , near the\nnegative velocity limit of Complex C. For Mrk 876, where\nthe H2 column density is the highest, we corrected the\nO VI profile for contamination from H2 by measuring the\nother H2 lines in the vicinity of the O VI line. Our model\nof the H2 (6\u20130) P(3) line included two components (1:\nvLSR = \u22127 km s\u22121 , depth = 0.60, FWHM = 31 km s\u22121 ; 2:\nvLSR = \u221236 km s\u22121 , depth = 0.30, FWHM = 19 km s\u22121 ).\nThe effect of this process is to reduce the measured highvelocity O VI column density slightly. To account for the\nerrors this process introduces, our systematic error on the\nO VI column density towards Mrk 876 includes the effect\nof varying the model parameters: v(H2 ) by \u00b110 km s\u22121 ,\nthe H2 depth by \u00b110%, and the H2 width by \u00b110%. Towards PG 1351+640, the sight line with the second highest\nmolecular hydrogen column density, the Complex C O VI\nabsorption does not extend to \u2212200 km s\u22121 , so there is no\nH2 interference.\n\n\f4\n\nFox et al.\n3.2. HST\n\nThe GHRS and STIS spectra we use are described in\nTable 3. We refer the reader to Brandt et al. (1994)\nand Kimble et al. (1998) for descriptions of the on-orbit\nperformance of the GHRS and STIS instruments, respectively. All data were all taken with intermediate resolution gratings, and were reduced using standard processing\npipelines. The grating used and its resolution, found in\nthe GHRS (Soderblom et al. 1995) and STIS (Proffitt et\nal. 2002) Instrument Handbooks, are listed for each exposure in columns three and eight.\nIn order to achieve consistency in comparing FUSE and\nHST spectra, we chose to display all absorption line spectra in 10 km s\u22121 bins. Given that the pixel size between\nGHRS and STIS exposures varies (column nine), our wish\nfor 10 km s\u22121 rebinned pixels implied a different rebinning factor for the different HST spectra, and this factor\nis given in column ten of Table 3.\nThe velocities were converted from the heliocentric to\nthe LSR reference frame using the corrections listed in\nTable 1. The velocity calibration from the HST detector pipelines is far more reliable than from the FUSE\npipelines, so no further alignment was considered necessary. Any residual errors introduced by inaccuracies in the\nGHRS and STIS wavelength scales are unlikely to change\nthe conclusions of this paper, since the kinematic interrelationships we focus on are mainly between absorption\nlines in the FUSE dataset.\nWe used \u2248 10 \u00c5 regions on either side of N V \u03bb1238.821\nfor continuum fitting, in the same manner as was used\nfor the FUSE data (\u00a73.1). In the case of PG 1259+593,\nthe same procedure was used for Si IV \u03bb1393.755, C IV\n\u03bb1548.195, and various low and intermediate ionization\nlines. All our targets are extragalactic sources, which tend\n(unlike stellar spectra) to have flat continua, so the continuum placement process was generally straightforward.\n4. results\n\nOur measurements of high-velocity, highly ionized absorption are presented in Table 4. For each high ionization absorption line detected at Complex C velocities,\nwe list the rest vacuum wavelength (\u03bb), velocity range of\nhigh-velocity absorption (vmin , vmax ), velocity centroid\nand width of high-velocity absorption (v\u0304 and b), obtained\nthrough either the moments of the apparent optical depth\nprofile or through Gaussian component fitting, equivalent\nwidth (W\u03bb ), column density (N ) and signal-to-noise ratio\nper resolution element (S/N) in the vicinity of the line.\nAll velocities in this table, and throughout this paper, are\nquoted in the LSR reference frame, and all column densities quoted are measured in the high-velocity gas, not\nintegrated over the full extent of the absorption. S III is\nnot usually recognised as a high ion, but we include measurements of high-velocity S III absorption here to assess\nthe relationship between absorption in intermediate and\nhighly ionized gas.\nThe velocity ranges we used for the Complex C absorption were chosen after careful consideration of the extent\nof the high-velocity absorption in different species along\neach sight line. In some cases these are different (by up\nto 20 km s\u22121 ) from the velocity ranges used in S03, due to\nthe addition of newer, higher S/N data and improvements\n\nin the pipeline processing.\nOur table makes use of two methods for finding the\ncentral velocity and width of highly ionized absorption.\nWhen possible, we fit Gaussian components to the data,\nand present the formal central velocity (v\u0304) and width (b) of\nthe Gaussian. This is only possible when the high-velocity\ncomponent is distinct and free from blending with other\nlines. The other method makes use of the moments of\nthe apparent optical depth, found from the continuumnormalized flux profile F (v) by\n1\n\u03c4a (v) = ln\n.\n(1)\nF (v)\nThe first moment gives the velocity centroid\nZ vmax\nZ vmax\n\u03c4a (v)dv.\n(2)\nv\u03c4a (v)dv/\nv\u0304 =\nvmin\n\nvmin\n\nThe second moment yields the Doppler width\ns Z\nZ vmax\nvmax\n2\nb= 2\n\u03c4a (v)dv.\n(v \u2212 v\u0304) \u03c4a (v)dv/\n\n(3)\n\nvmin\n\nvmin\n\nWhen the Gaussian fit method is available, we use this as\nthe preferable indicator of velocity centroid, since the moment method gives a skewed result when the absorption\nis highly asymmetric about the line center. With either\nmethod, our error on v\u0304 accounts for both statistical errors\nand uncertainty in the velocity zero point (5 km s\u22121 for\nFUSE spectra, and 2 km s\u22121 for HST data). The error on\nb accounts only for statistical errors, since the line width\nis insensitive to the zero point of the velocity scale.\nThe column densities were calculated using the apparent optical depth (AOD) technique (Savage & Sembach\n1991); first \u03c4a (v) is converted to Na (v) using\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010 m c \u0011 \u0012 \u03c4 (v) \u0013\n\u03c4a (v)\ne\na\n14\nNa (v) =\n=\n3.768\n\u00d7\n10\n, (4)\n\u03c0e2\nf\u03bb\nf\u03bb\nwhere f is the oscillator strength and \u03bb the wavelength\nof the transition (expressed in \u00c5 when using the second\nform, to give Na (v) in cm\u22122 (km s\u22121 )\u22121 ). Equation (4) is\nthen integrated to find the total column density between\ntwo velocity limits:\nZ vmax\nNa (v) dv\n(5)\nNa =\nvmin\n\nFor sight lines in which we detect no high-velocity S III\nor N V absorption, we present 3\u03c3 upper limits for the column density, unless blending prevents such a measurement\nbeing made.\nThere are two errors quoted for each measurement of\nequivalent width and column density. The first is a statistical error, found from a quadrature sum of uncertainties\nin the count rate (Poisson noise) and continuum placement\nuncertainty. The second error is a conservative estimation\nof systematic error, found from a quadrature addition of\nfixed pattern noise in the detectors, and choice of velocity integration limits. We estimated fixed pattern errors\nper pixel of 10% for FUSE, 2% for GHRS, and 1% for\nSTIS detectors, and an uncertainty in the velocity limits of 15 km s\u22121 for FUSE spectra, and 6 km s\u22121 for\nboth GHRS and STIS spectra. Note that this velocity\nerror itself has two components: one due to the intrinsic uncertainty in the post-calibration velocity scale, and\n\n\fHighly Ionized Gas Surrounding Complex C\n\n5\n\none due to the uncertainty over which velocities should be\nused to define high-velocity absorption. It is the velocity\nrange uncertainty which dominates our systematic error in\nmost cases, since the high-velocity absorption is not always\ndistinct from low-velocity absorption, and sometimes the\nchosen division is somewhat arbitrary. The signal-to-noise\nratio per resolution element is calculated by measuring\nof the rms dispersion of the data around the fitted continuum, in the proximity of each line. In every case our\nindependently measured O VI column density is statistically identical (within the 1\u03c3 error) to the one previously\npublished in S03.\n\nvelocity absorption, both ions recover to the continuum\njust beyond \u2212210 km s\u22121 , and on the positive side they\nboth start to recover at \u2212115 km s\u22121 . Though the C II\nline is heavily saturated, damping wings would not appear\nunless N (C II) & 1021 cm\u22122 , so the observed wings are\nlikely kinematic, not Lorentzian. With our chosen velocity limits, we measure W\u03bb (O VI)= 53 \u00b1 6 \u00b1 7 m\u00c5, cor+0.05\nresponding to log N (O VI)= 13.66+0.04\n\u22120.04 \u22120.04 . Gaussian\ncomponent fitting reveals the center of this absorption to\nbe \u2212133 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121 , which (within the error) is the same\nvelocity as the H I line center (\u2212137 km s\u22121 ).\n\n5. relationships between high ion and low ion\n\nComplex C gas is very pronounced in the H I profile towards Mrk 817, with a strong, distinct component centered\nat \u2212109 km s\u22121 (right panel of Figure 2). This feature is\nmirrored in the Si II, C II, S III, and O VI profiles, which\nall display clear absorption at this velocity. The S III\ndetection is the strongest among all the Complex C sight\nlines, with an equivalent width W\u03bb (S III)= 32 \u00b1 3 \u00b1 10 m\u00c5,\nand a central velocity of \u2212114 \u00b1 9 km s\u22121 , showing a kinematic connection between the neutral and intermediateionization gas. We do not expect contamination from the\nH2 (0\u20130) P(2) \u03bb1012.173 line, since there is no H2 absorption out of the J = 2 levels in this direction. A double\nintergalactic Ly\u03b1 feature happens to occur at just the redshift to blend with N V \u03bb1238.821, so although at first\nglance N V absorption appears to be present, we have no\nway of knowing conclusively. Strong broadening from the\nIVC at \u221240 km s\u22121 blends with high-velocity O VI absorption, so the true extent of high-velocity O VI is hard\nto ascertain, but with a velocity range choice of \u2212160 to\n\u221280 km s\u22121 we obtain W\u03bb (O VI)= 93 \u00b1 2 \u00b1 29 m\u00c5, and\n+0.08\nhence log N (O VI)= 13.97+0.02\n\u22120.02 \u22120.11 . The mean O VI ve\u22121\nlocity is \u2212109 \u00b1 10 km s , exactly the same as the H I\ncentroid. What appears to be a positive velocity wing in\nthe O VI profile is actually an intergalactic Ly\u03b2 absorber\nat 2360 \u00b1 330 km s\u22121 , a velocity which suggests an association with the Canes Venatici galaxy grouping (Tully\n1988).\n\nabsorption\nFigures 2, 3, and 4 display stacks of absorption line and\nH I 21 cm emission line profiles for Mrk 279 and Mrk 817,\nMrk 876 and PG 1351+640, and PG 1259+593 respectively. Dashed vertical lines correspond to the peaks in\nthe neutral hydrogen emission line profile given in the top\npanel, and show the velocities at which the neutral gas\ncolumn density is highest. Dotted lines illustrate our continuum placement, chosen using the technique described\nin \u00a73. Absorption in the velocity range corresponding\nto Complex C absorption is shaded in gray, according to\nthe limits quoted in Table 4 \u2013 we note that the width of\nthe Complex C absorption components may vary between\nspecies, hence the shading is included principally for illustrative purposes. Short vertical tick marks indicate the location of absorption blends. For Galactic blends, the tick\nmarks designate the velocity where we expect the component to appear, assuming the absorbing ion occurs at\nthe same velocity as the neutral hydrogen. In the cases\nof Mrk 876 and PG 1351+640, many of the blends have\na two-component structure, which is marked accordingly.\nFor extragalactic blends, where the absorption blend occurs at higher redshift, the tick marks simply designate\nthe line center of the blend.\n5.1. Mrk 279\nThe H I profile towards Mrk 279 shows eight components between \u2212150 and 50 km s\u22121 , including two Complex C features at \u2212137 and \u2212102 km s\u22121 (left panel of\nFigure 2). There appears to be corresponding absorption\ncentered near \u2212137 km s\u22121 in the Si II, C II, N V and\nO VI profiles. The detection of high-velocity N V absorption, although tentative, is particularly interesting, and\nwas first reported in Penton, Stocke, & Shull (2000). This\nfeature is centered at \u2212149 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 , and we measure\nits equivalent width as 17 \u00b1 5 \u00b1 3 m\u00c5, between the velocity limits of \u2212190 and \u2212115 km s\u22121 , corresponding to\n+0.02\nlog N (N V)= 12.93+0.12\n\u22120.17 \u22120.01 . Since the systematic errors change the equivalent width but not the presence of\nthe feature (i.e., it could be 14 \u00b1 5 or 20 \u00b1 5 m\u00c5), the\nformal significance of the high-velocity N V detection is\n17/5 > 3\u03c3. This absorption extends down to \u2212190 km s\u22121 ,\nnot to \u2212210 km s\u22121 as do the other ions shown in Figure 2. The large number of neutral hydrogen components\npresent in this direction makes the separation of low and\nhigh-velocity gas difficult. However, it is striking how\nthe high-velocity O VI absorption traces the shape of the\nC II absorption closely; on the negative side of the high-\n\n5.2. Mrk 817\n\n5.3. Mrk 876\nThe Mrk 876 sight line (left panel of Figure 3) has a\ntwo-component high-velocity H I profile, with a very weak\n\u2212173 km s\u22121 component and a stronger \u2212133 km s\u22121 component, seen weakly in Si II and more clearly in O VI.\nThe Ar I and N V lines show no significant high-velocity\ndetection. C II \u03bb1036.337 is too saturated to make measurements near the line center, but reveals the presence\nof absorption out to \u2212220 km s\u22121 . High-velocity S III\nabsorption is hard to separate from the strong molecular hydrogen absorption in this direction. The highvelocity O VI absorption is extended and broad, with\nno recovery to the continuum out to < \u2212220 km s\u22121 ,\nat which velocity a blend with H2 (6\u20130) P(3) \u03bb1031.191\nbecomes significant. We measure the velocity centroid\nof O VI to be \u2212148 \u00b1 9 km s\u22121 , which is only different\nfrom that of the H I component at the 2\u03c3 level; given the\nstrong blending from H2 lines, we cannot say whether this\n+0.02 +0.09\ndifference is real. With log N (O VI)= 14.12\u22120.02\n\u22120.11 ,\nMrk 876 has the highest high-velocity column density of\nO VI of any Complex C sight line in our sample, yet with\n\n\f6\n\nFox et al.\n\nlog N (H I)= 19.39 \u00b1 0.02 the lowest neutral hydrogen column density.\n5.4. PG 1351+640\nThe PG 1351+640 sight line has strong high-velocity\nH I emission at \u2212158 km s\u22121 , and a weaker component\nat \u2212115 km s\u22121 (right panel of Figure 3). Absorption\nat this velocity is not clear in Ar I, but clearly exists\nin Si II and C II. No high-velocity gas is apparent in\nS III; the high column density of molecular hydrogen along\nthis sight line causes strong blending between H2 P(4) (8\u2013\n0) \u03bb1012.261 and the S III line and makes an assesment\nof the presence of high-velocity S III absorption difficult.\nNote that the molecular hydrogen lines in our plots have\na two-component nature, due to local and IVC absorption. Absorption is present in O VI, but its extent is\nhard to ascertain, because of broad local absorption near\n0 km s\u22121 , and blending with H2 (6\u20130) P(3) \u03bb1031.191 below \u2212200 km s\u22121 . Integrating over the optical depth profile reveals an O VI central velocity of \u2212147 \u00b1 10 km s\u22121 ,\n11 km s\u22121 redward of the H I. We measure an upper limit\n+0.11\nof log N (N V)< 13.39 and log N (O VI)= 13.66+0.08\n\u22120.08 \u22120.15 ,\namong the lowest columns of high-velocity O VI in our five\nsight lines, 0.46 dex less than the value towards Mrk 876.\nWe also note the presence of an extended positive velocity\nwing in O VI, the like of which has been noted by S03\nin 22 sight lines, 18 of which lie in the Northern Galactic\nhemisphere. Although apparently unrelated to Complex C\ngas, these wings nonetheless constitute a tracer of highly\nionized high-velocity gas whose origin is unknown.\n5.5. PG 1259+593\nTwo stacks of absorption lines for PG 1259+593 are presented in Figure 4, since in this case we have the benefit\nof STIS E140M data with extensive wavelength coverage.\nWe include the H I and O VI profiles in both panels for\nease of comparison. The structure of the nearby absorption along the PG 1259+593 sightline is clearly illustrated\nin the H I profile, which shows three distinct components:\nzero-velocity absorption, presumably tracing nearby gas,\nintermediate-velocity gas (centered at v = \u221254 km s\u22121 )\nand high-velocity gas (centered at v = \u2212128 km s\u22121 ).\nThese components are clearly mirrored in absorption in\nSi II \u03bb1020.699 and Ar I \u03bb1048.220, and trace the densest\nregions of gas along the sight line. An extra absorption\ncomponent along this sight line at v = \u2212110 km s\u22121 was\nsuggested by Richter et al. (2001a), upon detailed analysis of STIS data, and has been confirmed by component\nfitting of the O I \u03bb1302.169 line (Sembach et al. 2003b).\nS III is detected in Complex C with an equivalent width\nW\u03bb (S III)= 17 \u00b1 5 \u00b1 12 m\u00c5.\nWith regard to the highly ionized Complex C gas, components of absorption are clearly seen at Complex C velocities in Si IV, C IV and O VI. In each of these three cases,\nthe weaker member of the resonance doublet was of no\nvalue in measuring a column density, due to either a lack of\ndiscernable absorption, or contamination from other lines.\n+0.03\nWe measure log N (Si IV)= 12.73+0.02\n\u22120.01 \u22120.02 , log N (C IV)=\n+0.03 +0.01\n+0.05\n13.26\u22120.04 \u22120.02 , and log N (O VI)= 13.71+0.04\n\u22120.04 \u22120.05 .\nHigh-velocity N V absorption is not seen in the data; we\nmeasure a 3\u03c3 upper limit to the high-velocity N V column\n\ndensity of log N (N V)< 12.85. This non-detection is qualitatively consistent with the low N/O ratio measured by\nRichter et al. (2001a) and Collins et al. (2003a) in this direction. The kinematics of the high-velocity absorption are\ninteresting, since we measure v\u0304(Si IV)= \u2212119 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 ,\nv\u0304(C IV)= \u2212106\u00b14 km s\u22121 , and v\u0304(O VI)= \u2212110\u00b15 km s\u22121 ,\nall by component fitting. This sight line thus exhibits\na 18 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121 difference between the centers of velocity of H I and O VI, with the C IV appearing to follow the O VI, and the Si IV falling inbetween. The\nintermediate-ionization S III line has a velocity centroid of\n\u2212104 \u00b1 9 km s\u22121 . Note that absorption from Si II, Si III,\nand Si IV is seen over the same velocity range.\nTo further illustrate the kinematic structure of the Complex C gas toward PG 1259+593, we compare apparent\ncolumn density profiles of various species in Figure 5. In\neach panel one of the profiles has been normalized in order\nto compare its shape with the other profile. We include\nions that trace low-ionization gas (H I and Si II), intermediate ionization gas (S III), and highly ionized gas (Si IV,\nC IV, and O VI). Complex C absorption is clearly seen in\nall these ionic species. The two component high-velocity\nstructure is most easily seen in the second panel, where\nwe compare Si II \u03bb1526.707 with C IV \u03bb1548.195 from the\nSTIS data. We return to a discussion of the absorption\nkinematics in \u00a78.2.\n6. potential ionization mechanisms\n\nIn studying highly ionized gas in HVCs our ultimate\ngoal is to determine the ionization mechanism(s). Not\nonly is this interesting in its own right, but also knowledge about ionization may be able to provide information\non the location of HVCs. In this section we describe the\npotential mechanisms that could create highly ionized gas\nin or around HVCs.\n6.1. Collisional Ionization Equilibrium (CIE)\nPerhaps the simplest picture that can account for simultaneous observations of Si IV, C IV, and O VI (as seen\ntoward PG 1259+593) is one involving a cloud of gas at\na fixed kinetic temperature, with every collisional ionization balanced by a radiative recombination. Sutherland\n& Dopita (1993) calculated the fraction of each element\nin each ionization stage, assuming these equilibrium conditions. To test to see if CIE conditions exist, one needs\nto find that the column densities of multiple ions are simultaneously consistent with the model predictions at one\ntemperature. However, in interstellar and intergalactic environments, such conditions rarely apply to the O VI ion,\nsince it exists at temperatures of a few \u00d7105 K where the\ncooling function is maximized. When cooling occurs faster\nthan recombination the ionization can become \"frozen-in\",\nproducing gas referred to as overionized (Kafatos 1973).\nA single phase of hot gas under CIE conditions would\nbe traced by absorption at the same central velocity in\nall ions. Velocity offsets cannot be explained by a singlephase, single-temperature CIE model.\n6.2. Photoionization\nThe high ions Si IV, C IV, N V, and O VI require energies of 33.5, 47.9, 77.5, and 113.9 eV respectively for their\ncreation. If the radiation field is hard enough to contain\n\n\fHighly Ionized Gas Surrounding Complex C\nsignificant intensities of photons at these energies, the ions\ncan be produced directly by photoionization. S03 have\nconducted photoionization models to investigate the ionization fraction of O VI (fO V I ) in HVCs as a function of\nneutral hydrogen column density and ionization parameter\nU = n\u03b3 /nH , where n\u03b3 and nH are the photon density and\ntotal hydrogen density, respectively. The models assumed\nthe gas is optically thin to ionizing and cooling radiation\n(i.e. log N (H I)< 17.2), and took the QSO spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) from Madau (1992), normalized at 912\n\u00c5 to J\u03bd0 = 1 \u00d7 10\u221223 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 Hz\u22121 sr\u22121 (Haardt &\nMadau 1996). The S03 photoionization models provides a\nstrong conclusion: to produce an O VI column density of\n1014 cm\u22122 requires the HVC to be several hundred kiloparsecs in depth, for any metallicity in the range Z = 0.01\u2013\n1.0Z\u2299 . These sizes are far too large to be consistent with\nmost models of HVCs; Blitz et al. (1999) predict typical diameters of \u223c 25 kpc; theories that place HVCs closer to the\nMilky Way predict even smaller sizes. If the H I column\ndensity in the model is increased above log N (H I)< 17.2,\nso that the cloud is no longer optically thin, the predicted\nO VI and C IV column densities drop, and the conclusion\nbecomes even stronger: O VI is most likely collisionally\nionized.\nMore detailed photoionization modeling of the high ions\nin Complex C would need to include the effect of ionizing\nphotons escaping from the Galactic disk. A key uncertainty in doing this is the escape fraction of ionizing photons (Bland-Hawthorn & Maloney 1999). The strong He II\nionization edge at 54 eV in hot star spectra limits the flux\nof photons energetic enough to produce either N V or O VI.\nTherefore, in studies of highly ionized gas in the ISM of the\nMilky Way, N V and O VI are almost always interpreted\nas being tracers of collisionally ionized gas (e.g. Savage et\nal. 2003; Fox et al. 2003). So, modifications to the radiation field will be more significant for calculating the ion\nfractions of low and intermediate ionization species, than\nfor high ions such as O VI.\n6.3. Radiatively Cooling Gas Flows (RC)\nAs hot (T0 & 106 K) gas cools down by radiative recombination it will pass through the temperature regime\nat which high ions such as N V and O VI exist. Edgar\n& Chevalier (1986) estimated the ionization properties of\na body of gas cooling from an initial high temperature\n(T = 106 K), for a variety of cases ranging from isochoric\n(constant density) to isobaric (constant pressure). Their\nmodels predict the column density of Si IV, C IV, N V, and\nO VI; for the case of O VI, the column density is given by\nN (O VI) = 4 \u2212 6 \u00d7 1014(vcool /102 km s\u22121 ) cm\u22122 , assuming\nsolar abundances, where vcool is the flow velocity. Heckman et al. (2002), upon discovering a correlation between\nline width and column density in O VI absorbers across\na wide variety of locations, have suggested that all O VI\nabsorbers can be explained by radiatively cooling hot gas\npassing through transition temperatures. This conclusion\nremains the same over a wide range of metallicity. This\nresult relies on there being a linear relationship between\nthe characteristic flow velocity and the non-thermal line\nbroadening parameter bnt .\nIf the RC model is to give a complete description of the\nhighly ionized gas present in or near HVCs, it would need\n\n7\n\nto account for the origin of the hot gas in the first place,\nand the kinematical alignments between neutral and ionized phases of gas that are reported in this paper.\n6.4. Conductive Interfaces (CI)\nWhen reservoirs of hot and cold gas come into contact\nwith one another, electron collisions will conduct energy\nfrom the hot medium towards the cooler medium, at a rate\ndepending on the plasma conductivity and the orientation\nof the magnetic field relative to the interface. Transitiontemperature ions, such as C IV, N V, and O VI, can be\nproduced in the conduction front as the cooler gas evaporates and the hotter gas condenses.\nBorkowski, Balbus, & Fristrom (1990) studied the energy transport when a planar front is established between an interstellar cloud and a hot (T \u223c 106 K) coronal\nmedium. The calculations of Borkowski et al. (1990) predict the expected column densities of the ions Si IV, C IV,\nN V, and O VI produced in a conductive interface, as a\nfunction of both time and the angle \u03b8 between the normal\nto the front and the magnetic field. We consider magnetic\nfield orientations of \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 \u2212 85\u25e6 and interface ages of\nlog [t(yr)] = 5.0 \u2212 7.0. Since the thermal conductivity of\nplasma is far greater along magnetic field lines than across\nthem, the conduction is quenched when the field runs parallel to the interface, and so the predicted high ion column\ndensities are much lower in this case. As with any interface\nmodel, the CI theory predicts that there should be no (or\nsmall) velocity offsets between high ions observed at the\nsurface of the cloud and neutral ions observed within it.\nFurthermore, the line widths are predicted to be thermally\ndominated. These conditions provide a set of diagnostic\ntests that can be applied when trying to explain the origin\nof an O VI absorber.\n6.5. Turbulent Mixing Layers (TML)\nTurbulence is increasingly being considered to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in the ISM. In an interface between\nturbulent hot gas and a region of cold gas, any relative\nmotion of the gas phases can generate Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities that mix the hot and cold gases together in\na mixing layer. Such a layer would be at transition temperatures, sufficiently hot to generate ions such as N V\nand O VI by electron collisions. TML theory was introduced by Begelman & Fabian (1990), who argued that\nconduction will only form a significant mechanism of energy transport in a quiescent medium, but in the turbulent\nhot ISM tangled magnetic fields will suppress conduction.\nSlavin, Shull & Begelman (1993) developed the TML theory to predict high ion column densities, as a function of\nthe entrainment velocity and mixing-layer temperature.\nWe consider the TML predictions with the entrainment\nvelocity of the gas flow in the range 25 \u2212 100 km s\u22121 ,\nand the temperature of the post-mixed gas in the range\nlog T = 5.0 \u2212 5.5. A key difference between TML theory\nand other ionization models is a high N (C IV)/N (O VI)\nratio; observation of this quantity thus provides a key test\nof the TML theory.\n6.6. Shock Ionization (SI)\nIf a high-velocity cloud passes through a surrounding\nmedium at a velocity higher than the local sound speed, a\n\n\f8\n\nFox et al.\n\nshock front will develop at the leading edge of the cloud.\nThe temperature in the gas behind the front could then\nbe raised to levels at which highly ionized material can\nbe formed by collisional ionization (T & 105 K). Dopita &\nSutherland (1996) generated a grid of low-density shock\nmodels, predicting the column density of high ions for\nshock velocities in the range 150 < vS < 500 km s\u22121 , assuming solar abundances. In this study we consider the\nSI model with shock velocities of 150 \u2212 500 km s\u22121 and\n3/2\nmagnetic parameters 0 \u2264 B0 /n0 \u2264 4 \u03bcG cm\u22123/2 .\nIn the shock ionization model, the shock velocity is the\nkey parameter determining the expected column densities\nof high ions. We note that since Complex C is falling toward the Galaxy (at \u2248 130 km s\u22121 ), any Galactic wind or\nfountain outflow would serve to increase the Mach number and hence the strength of the shock. In this scenario,\nthe interaction of the cloud with the surrounding environment would be contributing to both the ionization and the\nmetallicity of the cloud gas. Instabilities arising from the\ninteraction of a HVC with magnetic fields could also influence the ionization properties of the cloud (Konz et al.\n2001).\n6.7. Supernova Remnants (SNR)\nSlavin & Cox (1992) and Shelton (1998) have considered the evolution of low density supernova remnants expanding into a surrounding medium. However, since no\nstars have ever been detected in HVCs despite extensive\nsearches (Hopp, Schulte-Ladbeck, & Kerp 2003; Willman\net al. 2002; Davies et al. 2002), we do not expect them to\nharbor SNRs, and so we do not consider the SNR model\nany further.\n7. non-solar abundance issues\n\nA difficulty we face in applying ionization models to\nComplex C is the fact that the elemental abundance ratios are known to be non-solar in the complex. In this\nsection we investigate the effect that changed abundances\nwill have on the model high ion column density predictions.\nIn any model where the predicted columns of high ions\nare regulated by radiative cooling losses, the O VI column densities are fairly insensitive to metallicity. This is\nbecause oxygen is the primary coolant for interstellar gas\nwith log T = 5.0 \u2212 5.6, and so reducing the oxygen abundance reduces the cooling rate, and hence lengthens the\ncooling time of the gas. This feedback effect causes the\npredicted columns to be fairly constant over metallicity\n(Edgar & Chevalier 1986; Heckman et al. 2002). Savage\net al. (2003) discuss how the expected value of N (O VI)\ndepends on the metallicity in the cooling gas of a Galactic\nfountain flow. Since the total column density of cooling\ngas is given by Ncool = \u1e44H tcool , where \u1e44H is the flux of\ncooling gas (hydrogen ions cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) and tcool is the cooling time of the gas, the expected column density of O VI\nis given by\nN (O VI) = fO\n\nVI AO \u1e44H tcool ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere fO VI is the fraction of oxygen atoms present as\nO VI, and AO is the abundance of oxygen with respect to\nhydrogen.\n\nIt is often assumed for departures from solar abundances\n\u22121\nthat tcool \u221d n\u22121\nH AZ , where nH is the initial ionized hydrogen density in the cooling gas and AZ is the mean\nmetallicity of the dominant coolants in the gas. This relation assumes that the cooling is dominated by the radiative emission produced by the heavy elements. Since\noxygen is the most important coolant, we take AZ = AO ,\nand therefore N (O VI) \u221d fO VI \u1e44H n\u22121\nH , which is independent of the oxygen abundance. Since \u1e44H n\u22121\nH has dimensions of velocity, we can identify \u1e44 n\u22121\n\u2261\nvcool , so that\nH\nN (O VI) \u221d fO VI vcool .\nHowever, the calculations of Benjamin, Benson, &\nCox (2001) show that the cooling time scales more like\n\u2212\u03b2\ntcool \u221d n\u22121\nH AZ , where \u03b2 \u2248 0.85 over the range Z =\n0.1 \u2212 1.0Z\u2299. Physically, this effect is due to the inclusion of cooling from hydrogen and helium as well as metal\nline cooling. In this case, the expected column density of\nO VI will scale as\nN (O VI) \u221d A1\u2212\u03b2\nO vcool\n\n(7)\n\n\u2032\nSo, if the abundance of oxygen changes from A\u2299\nO to AO ,\nthen the predicted column density of O VI will change\nfrom N (O VI)\u2299 to N (O VI)\u2032 according to\n\nN (O VI)\u2032\n=\nN (O VI)\u2299\n\n\u0012\n\nA\u2032O\nA\u2299\nO\n\n\u00131\u2212\u03b2\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nFor elements other than oxygen, which are less important coolants, the predicted column densities will also scale\n1\u2212\u03b2\nas N (X)\u2032 /N (X)\u2299 = (A\u2032O /A\u2299\n, provided that A\u2032X /A\u2299\nX =\nO)\n\u2299\n\u2032\nAO /AO . However, if there are deviations from the solar\nratios among the other heavy elements, then\nN (X)\u2032\n(AX /AO )\u2032 (A\u2032O )1\u2212\u03b2\nA\u2032X\n=\n=\n\u2299\nN (X)\u2299\n(AX /AO )\u2299 (AO )1\u2212\u03b2\nA\u2299\nX\n\n\u0012\n\nA\u2032O\nA\u2299\nO\n\n\u0013\u2212\u03b2\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere X could represent either Si IV, C IV, or N V.

It can\nbe seen from Equation 10 that the adjusted logarithmic\ncolumn density ratios are independent of the exact value\nof \u03b2.\nThese arguments were originally formulated for the case\nof pure radiatively cooling gas flows (see \u00a76.3), but equally\napply to all other models considered in \u00a76.3\u2013\u00a76.6, since the\nrate of cooling is a critical component of all the other models. It should be emphasized that these results are approximate and neglect the contribution to the cooling by other\nelements (particularly carbon and nitrogen). Nonetheless,\nthis is a first attempt at quantifying the effects of low\nmetallicities on high ion production. Equation 10 has to\nbe applied twice in order to apply the model ionic ratio\npredictions to the Complex C gas; these two corrections\nare described in the next two subsections.\n\n\fHighly Ionized Gas Surrounding Complex C\n\n9\n\nWe now wish to determine the best estimates of [X/H]\nin Complex C for each of the elements oxygen, nitrogen,\nsilicon, and carbon so as to adjust the model predictions\naccordingly.

This conclusion is reinforced by strong detections\nof Fe II in Complex C (Murphy et al. 2000; Tripp et al.\n2003), who found that the measured iron abundances leave\nlittle room for depletion into dust. The absence of H2 in\nComplex C (Richter et al. 2001b) is consistent with the\nabsence of dust since H2 is thought to form on the surface\nof dust grains.\nFinally, note that (with the exception of carbon) we\nhave used measured abundance ratios of the neutral gas in\nComplex C; if this HVC is interacting with a surrounding\nmedium, then this medium could also display non-solar\nabundance patterns. In any model where gas is mixed between two media, non-solar abundance variations in the\nhot medium become a further complication, which is not\naccounted for here.\n= log\n\n\u0014\n\n8. comparison of observations and theory\n\n8.1. Ionic Ratios\nWe focus our discussion of ionization on the high ions\nSi IV, C IV, N V, and O VI. The lower ion stages are\nmore likely to be produced by photoionization, since there\nare many more ionizing photons below 50 eV capable of\nproducing them. This origin has been suggested as an explanation for low ionization species in other high-velocity\nabsorbers (e.g. Collins et al. 2003b, toward PKS 2155-304\nand Mrk 509).\nThe best data available exist for the PG 1259+593 sight\nline, for which we measure high-velocity ionic ratios of\nN (Si IV)/N (O VI) = 0.10 \u00b1 0.02, N (C IV)/N (O VI) =\n0.35+0.05\n\u22120.06 , and N (N V)/N (O VI) < 0.07 (3\u03c3). Our other\nnew results are measurements of the N (N V)/N (O VI)\nratio: 0.19+0.06\n\u22120.07 for Mrk 279, < 0.11 for Mrk 876, and\n< 0.35 for PG 1351+640. Our ionic ratio information\nis displayed graphically in Figures 6 and 7, which show\nlog [N (C IV)/N (O VI)] versus log [N (N V)/N (O VI)], and\nlog [N (Si IV)/N (O VI)] against log [N (N V)/N (O VI)] respectively. We choose to compare high ion column density\nratios, rather than absolute column densities, to allow for\nmultiple interfaces or regions along the line of sight where\nhot gas could exist. Using the model predictions summarized in Table 7, we can identify regions of this ionic ratio\nspace that gas behaving according to the various models\nshould occupy. Because of the various free parameters that\ncan vary in each model, we assume the models to occupy\nboxes rather than lines in these ionic ratio diagrams. For\neach of four theories (CI, RC, TML, SI) we have computed the model predictions for the cases of solar abundances (light regions) and Complex C abundances (darker\nregions). The changes in the predicted ion ratios due to\nthese abundance variations are fairly substantial. For ease\nof comparison, blue arrows connect the two boxes for each\nmodel.\n\nIt can be seen that the adjusted RC model significantly underestimates the observed N (C IV)/N (O VI),\nN (Si IV)/N (O VI), and N (N V)/N (O VI) ratios. The\nCIE model is incapable of simultaneously matching either the N (C IV)/N (O VI) or the N (Si IV)/N (O VI)\nratio, in either abundance case. The SI model can successfully reproduce both the N (C IV)/N (O VI) or the\nN (Si IV)/N (O VI) ratios, but significantly underestimates\nthe N (N V)/N (O VI) ratio toward Mrk 279 by over an order of magnitude. This narrows down the viable models to\nthe CI and TML theories. The CI model can reproduce the\nN (C IV)/N (O VI) ratio toward PG 1259+593, but seems\nto underestimate the N (Si IV)/N (O VI) ratio along this\nsight line. The TML theory has the opposite problem: it\ncan match the N (Si IV)/N (O VI) ratio but overestimates\nN (C IV)/N (O VI). Both these theories (when adjusted for\nComplex C abundances) predict N (N V)/N (O VI) ratios\nthat are marginally lower than the value observed toward\nMrk 279, but they do agree within the 2\u03c3 error on the measurement. Note that although we have fully accounted for\nerrors in the data, we have not fully accounted for errors\nin the model corrections. Uncertainties of \u223c 0.2 dex are\nlikely because of incomplete knowledge of the elemental\nabundances; perhaps a similar error arises from the assumption that the cooling is dominated by oxygen. From\nthese two plots we conclude that TMLs or CIs could be potential explanations for the highly ionized material around\nComplex C. We have outlined these two model boxes in\nblue in Figures 6 and 7 to highlight their position.\nExamining the CI model further, we note that the large\nsize of the CI model box in the ionic ratio planes is largely\ndue to the inclusion of interface age as a free parameter. As\nwe have no way of knowing the age of an interface around\nComplex C, we chose to include a range from 105 to 107\nyears, a period which spans the transition from evaporative to condensing interfaces. The data are most consistent with young (\u223c 105 yr) interfaces, since the adjustedabundance CI boxes in Figures 6 and 7 overlap the data\nat their high N (X)/N (O VI) extents, which correspond\nto lower interface age. Physically this is because the O VI\ncolumns do not reach their maximum values until \u223c 106 yr,\nbut the other high ions peak in abundance at earlier interface age. The theory predicts N (O VI) = 1012 \u2212 1013 cm\u22122\nper interface (depending on the magnetic field direction),\nwhich we can correct by a factor of 0.8 to account for nonsolar abundances. Even if we assume a magnetic field normal to the cloud boundary, we would still require between\nsix to eighteen interfaces (i.e., three to nine clouds), to\naccount for the observed O VI column densities in Complex C of 1013.66 \u2212 1014.12 , with a larger number if the\nmagnetic field has a component parallel to the boundary,\nquenching the conduction. In one particular case, we already know of a multiple component structure: two highvelocity neutral components are thought to exist toward\nPG 1259+593 (Richter et al. 2001a; Sembach et al. 2003b),\nproviding four interfaces. Therefore, at least one more low\ndensity neutral absorber at Complex C velocities, with a\npair of hot interfaces, is necessary to explain the O VI toward PG 1259+593 in the CI model. Such a component\ncould be too close in velocity to the \u2212128 km s\u22121 component to be resolved with current instruments.\nThe N (Si IV) prediction may be the least robust of the\n\n\fHighly Ionized Gas Surrounding Complex C\nvarious models, since Si IV has the lowest creation ionization potential (33.5 eV) of any of the high ions under\nstudy, and so is most susceptible to production by photoionization, for example by photons escaping the Galactic disk. This might lead to enhanced N (Si IV)/N (O VI)\nratios over the individual model predictions, raising all\nboxes vertically upward toward the PG 1259+593 data\npoint on Figure 7. Photoionization could also enhance the\nN (C IV)/N (O VI) ratio, if the radiation field were hard\nenough. On the other hand, depending on the slope of\nthe ionizing spectrum, the N (Si IV)/N (O VI) ratio could\nalso decrease if enough Si V is formed to depress the Si IV\nprediction. A more detailed understanding of the escaping radiation filed is needed to fully investigate the effect\nof additional photoionization. If it does play a role, then\nmultiple ionization processes are occuring in HVCs, just\nas multiple ionization processes appear to be at work in\nthe hot Galactic halo (Ito & Ikeuchi 1988; Shull & Slavin\n1994; Savage et al. 2003; Zsarg\u00f3 et al. 2003).\n8.2. Kinematic Information\nUnfortunately, given the paucity of data points and\nthe uncertainty in the model predictions stemming from\nthe numerous metallicity issues, we cannot at this point\nuniquely specify the ionization mechanism purely from\nthe ionic ratios. Analysis of ionic ratios has the further\nproblem that multiple, separate regions of absorbing gas,\nclosely related in velocity space, can contribute to the integrated column density along a line of sight, making interpretation of ionic ratios very difficult. However, the\nkinematics of the absorption provide further information;\nby comparing the extent and line centers of high-velocity\nabsorption between species, one can gain useful information regarding the ionization mechanism.\nIn the case of Mrk 279 and Mrk 817, high-velocity absorption is detected in low and high ionization species at\nvery similar velocities (Mrk 279: v\u0304O VI = \u2212133\u00b16 km s\u22121 ,\nv\u0304H I = \u2212137 km s\u22121 ; Mrk 817: v\u0304O VI = \u2212109 \u00b1 10 km s\u22121 ,\nv\u0304H I = \u2212109 km s\u22121 ). In the other three sight lines the\ndifference is less than 20 km s\u22121 . In Table 8 we list our\nmeasured central velocities of the high-velocity O VI, and\ncompare them to both the centers of the H I and Si II\ncomponents, and to earlier measures of the O VI velocities from S03. In our sample the average displacement\n< v\u0304O VI \u2212 v\u0304H I >= 3 \u00b1 12 km s\u22121 , where the error represents the standard deviation of the sample, whereas the\nS03 results (that used nine Complex C sight lines) have\nan average displacement < v\u0304O VI \u2212 v\u0304H I >= 0 \u00b1 13 km s\u22121 .\nThe differences between our measurements and the S03\nmeasurements of v\u0304O VI are due to different data reduction pipelines (v2.1.6 versus v1.8.7), and in the case of\nPG 1351+640, our inclusion of new data. These changes\ncaused the choice of velocity integration limits to change\n(when v is measured using the moment of the optical depth\ntechnique), or by our using the component fitting method\nwhen the line center was more clearly defined. We also\nmeasure < v\u0304O VI \u2212 v\u0304Si II >= 0 \u00b1 15 km s\u22121 . These small\ndifferences between the velocities of O VI, Si II, and H I\nreveal a strong kinematic connection between the neutral\nand highly ionized gas in Complex C.\nThe observed velocity alignments are consistent with,\nand indeed suggestive of, an origin at some form of inter-\n\n11\n\nface between cold/warm and hot regions of gas. There is\nno reason why the ion O VI should line up with H I otherwise, since these two species trace different interstellar\nphases and do not exist in the same physical regions, unless the O VI is frozen-in at a far lower temperature than\nthat at which it normally appears. We stress that the observed alignment between O VI and neutral species is not\nan artifact of the velocity calibration procedure, which relied upon tying the neutral species (but not the O VI) in\nthe FUSE bandpass with H I emission components.\nIn an interface scenario, any neutral cloud, regardless of\nits depth, contributes two interfaces to the line of sight.\nThus one would not expect to see a good correlation between N (O VI) and N (H I) along lines of sight sampling\nhot and cold regions of gas separated by interfaces. Indeed,\nSavage et al. (2003) found no such correlation when studying the O VI distribution along 102 sight lines through the\nGalactic halo. The ability of interface geometries to explain kinematic correspondences between low- and highionization absorbing species has been recognised before\n(Cowie et al. 1979; Zsarg\u00f3 et al. 2003). Recently, Howk,\nSembach, & Savage (2003) concluded that interfaces along\nthe line of sight toward globular cluster star vZ 1128 are a\nplausible explanation for the similar kinematics observed\nin low- and high-ionization species in that direction.\nToward PG 1259+593, a displacement of 18 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121\nis observed between the high-velocity O VI and H I\ncentroids. However, it is already suspected that there\nare two high-velocity neutral gas components along this\nsight line, with the \u2212128 km s\u22121 component containing\nenough neutral gas to be seen in H I emission, and the\n\u2212110 km s\u22121 component not detected in H I emission,\nbut seen in the more sensitive O I absorption line (Sembach et al. 2003b). Interestingly, if we assume the highvelocity O VI toward PG 1259+593 to be predominantly\nassociated with the \u2212110 km s\u22121 neutral gas component,\nso that v\u0304O VI \u2212 v\u0304H I = 0 \u00b1 6 km s\u22121 , then the average\ndisplacement between neutral and highly ionized Complex C gas becomes < v\u0304O VI \u2212 v\u0304H I >= \u22121 \u00b1 8 km s\u22121 .\nSuch a scenario, with two components having very different N (O VI)/N (H I) ratios, can easily be explained in the\ninterface picture by two neutral clouds of different column\ndensity, each with its own pair of interfaces. Therefore the\ntype of displacement seen toward PG 1259+593 is not inconsistent with the interface theory, but rather can be explained by multiple interfaces. Table 9 contains a detailed\nstudy of all the absorption species toward PG 1259+593\nfor which we could measure a precise line center to the\nComplex C gas, using Gaussian component fitting. Each of\nthe species appears to be centered either near \u2212128 km s\u22121\n(designated Component 1), or near \u2212110 km s\u22121 (Component 2). Component 2 has a overall higher degree of ionization, being seen in C IV and O VI. Though assigning a\ncomponent to each absorption line is difficult on the basis\nof these velocities alone, the stucture seen in Figure 4 and\nthe fact that these components have been reported elsewhere lend support to our conclusion that multiple components exist toward PG 1259+593.\nThe conductive interface (CI, \u00a76.4) and the turbulent\nmixing layer models (TML, \u00a76.5) both have the attractive\nfeature of naturally explaining the closely aligned kinematics observed between low and high ionization species.\n\n\f12\n\nFox et al.\n\nRecent studies have shown that turbulent magnetic fields\ndo not completely suppress thermal conduction across interfaces (Cho et al. 2003), so the true nature of the ionization at HVC surfaces likely includes both turbulent and\nconduction effects. Regardless of whether the energy is\ntransported by thermal conduction or turbulent mixing,\nour kinematic observations are consistent with the coreinterface structure of HVCs suggested by Ferrara & Field\n(1994), and discussed in Wolfire et al. (1995).\nComplex C is known to have an H I component at velocities \u2212205 \u2264 vLSR \u2264 \u2212155 km s\u22121 , along a ridge passing spatially along the middle of the main cloud (Wakker\n2001). This feature can be seen in Figure 1, and was\ndubbed the \"high-velocity ridge\" (HVR) by Tripp et al.\n(2003). These authors found similar morphologies and\nlow-ion column density ratios in the HVR and Complex C\nproper, suggesting similar abundances and physical conditions in the two parts of the complex. Of the five sight\nlines we study in detail here, Mrk 876 and PG 1351+640\npass through the HVR, with Mrk 279 just adjacent to the\nN (H I) = 5 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 contour, whereas Mrk 817 and\nPG 1259+593 clearly contain no HVR H I emission. Interestingly, as seen in Table 4, Mrk 817 and PG 1259+593\nare the same two sight lines whose velocity limits of O VI\nabsorption only extend to \u2212160 km s\u22121 . In other words,\nthose sight lines that display HVR H I emission also display HVR O VI absorption. This is further evidence of a\nkinematic correspondence between the low and high ionization species.\nAnalysis of the widths of the high-velocity components\ncan give information on the temperature in the absorbing\ngas. Fully interpreting line widths is difficult because of\nline blending, the presence of multiple components, instrumental broadening, and non-thermal broadening. However, we find that our observed high-velocity O VI line\nwidths lie in the range b = 27 \u2212 52 km s\u22121 (not accounting\nfor instrumental broadening, which for FUSE is of order\n15 \u2212 20 km s\u22121 ). A purely thermally broadened O VI absorber at 300,000 K would have b = 18 km s\u22121 , suggesting\nthat some non-thermal process is contributing to the line\nwidths. However, it is also possible that these detections\nare multiple thermally-broadened components blended together, especially toward PG 1259+593 where we already\nknow of two high-velocity components. One explicit prediction of the conductive interface theory is that the O VI\nlines should be predominantly thermally broadened \u2013 unfortunately, there are too many unknowns to fully test this\nprediction, but our data are not inconsistent with it.\nS03 noticed a trend in which the value of\nN (O VI)/N (H I) in Complex C increases toward lower\nlongitudes and latitudes. Tripp et al. (2003) interpreted\nthis as evidence supporting their claim that the lower\nlatitude and lower longitude parts of the complex are interacting more vigorously with the surrounding medium,\nforming a \"leading edge\" of the complex. This claim is\nbased on their detailed study of the physical conditions\nin the gas towards 3C 351. With our small sample of five\nsight lines with new measurements of O VI, it is difficult\nto either confirm or refute this claim. However, we note\nthat the variation in N (O VI)/N (H I) is predominantly\ncaused by variation in N (H I), which changes by a factor\nof \u2248 20 over the face of Complex C, whereas N (O VI)\n\nonly varies by a factor of \u2248 3. In the conductive interface scenario that we favor, this situation could reflect a\ncloud geometry in which the lower longitude and latitude\nparts of the cloud have a lower depth of neutral gas, but\nstill have a similar number of interfaces and hence similar\nN (O VI).\nBy using the O VI a tracer of a hot shell of material surrounding Complex C, one can estimate the total amount\nof mass contained in the hot ionized gas phase of the complex, according to\nMH+ (hot)\nNH+ (hot)\nMH+ (hot) =\n. MH I =\n. MH I\nMH I\nNH I\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\nNO VI fO\nVI (O/H)\u2299 Z\n=\n. MH I\n(14)\nNH I\nwhere fO VI is the fraction of oxygen atoms in the fivetimes-ionized state, and (O/H)\u2299 Z = AO = 10\u22124.31 is the\noxygen abundance in Complex C. Using the average observed ratio of NO VI /NH I = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 in Complex C\n(S03) and fO VI < 0.2, we find the mass of Complex C\nin O VI-bearing gas to be approximately 18% of the H I\nmass, or \u2248 15% of the total (H I+H II) hydrogen mass.\nThis fraction would decrease if a significant amount of H II\nis contained within the warm (T \u2248 8000 K) ionized material, but would increase if fO VI \u226a 0.2. Wakker (2001) has\nestimated the neutral mass of Complex C to be MH I =\n3 \u00d7 106 (d/6 kpc)2 M\u2299 , so that MH+ (hot) \u2248 5 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 if\nthe distance to Complex C is 6 kpc.\nIn the interface scenario, the detection of highly ionized gas in HVCs offers further evidence (albeit indirect)\nfor the presence of a hot extended corona or Local Group\nMedium with which Complex C is interacting. Several\nlines of evidence already exist that indicate a interaction\nbetween HVCs and the low density gaseous Galactic halo\n(Benjamin 1999; Quilis & Moore 2001). These include\n(a) the pattern of decreasing cloud velocities for clouds\ncloser to the Galactic plane, expected if drag dominates\nthe cloud infall, (b) cometary (head/tail) HVCs and evidence of stripping, (c) H\u03b1 enhancement on cloud edges,\n(d) X-ray emission possibly associated with Complex C,\nand (e) high non-thermal H I pressures. Studies with\nthe Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray satellites have recently detected both O VII and O VIII absorption near\nzero velocity (Fang, Sembach, & Canizares 2003; Nicastro\net al. 2003; Rasmussen, Kahn, & Paerels 2003). These ions\ncould be tracing the same extended corona that we believe\nis interacting with Complex C.\n9. insights from relevant nearby sight lines\n\nSeveral sight lines passing close to Complex C have been\nobserved with FUSE - we briefly mention the important\nproperties of the most relevant, since it is of interest how\nhighly ionized gas in these directions may relate to Complex C.\n9.1. H1821+643\nTripp et al. (2003) have published absorption line measurements of the sight line toward H1821+643, passing\nnear Complex C. There is a highly ionized absorption component in this direction at \u2212212 km s\u22121 , with unusual ionization properties: seen in C IV and O VI, but not in H I\nemission or Si III absorption. H1821+643 is a direction\n\n\fHighly Ionized Gas Surrounding Complex C\nthat passes through the Outer Arm of the Milky Way, but\nthe high-velocity component is well separated from the\nOuter Arm absorption. Using the Tripp et al. (2003) measurements of Si IV, C IV, and N V together with the S03\nmeasurement of O VI we find N (Si IV)/N (O VI) < 0.02,\nN (C IV)/N (O VI) = 0.32 \u00b1 0.13, and N (N V)/N (O VI) <\n0.10, similar to what is observed in Complex C. However,\nit is not clear whether this component has any affiliation\nwith Complex C, since the absorption is centered almost\n100 km s\u22121 away from the highly ionized gas seen in Complex C proper. Furthermore, the H1821+643 sight line\npasses more than 5\u25e6 from where gas at such velocities is\nseen in H I. The H I Lyman series 923.150, 920.963, and\n919.351 \u00c5 lines in the FUSE spectrum show no evidence\nfor a component at \u2212212 km s\u22121 , setting a 3\u03c3 upper limit\nof \u2248 80 m\u00c5 for a feature assumed to be 25 km s\u22121 wide,\ncorresponding to N (H I) < 1016 cm\u22122 .\n\n13\n\nour study in the following key points, numbers 1, 3, 5, and\n7 of which verify the basic findings of S03:\n1. In all FUSE sight lines through Complex C where\nH I emission has been detected, we observe highvelocity O VI absorption . Of the five Complex C\nsight lines showing high-velocity absorption studied here, the mean logarithmic column density is\nhlog N i = 13.82, with a standard deviation of 0.21\ndex.\n2. High-velocity N V absorption is detected at 3.2\u03c3\nsignificance in one Complex C sight line (Mrk 279).\nThe non-detection of high-velocity N V toward the\nother sight lines is consistent with the low N/O\nabundance ratio previously measured in the neutral\ngas of Complex C.\n\n9.2. Mrk 290, Mrk 487, and 3C 249.1\nMrk 290, found at l = 91.49\u25e6, b = 47.95\u25e6, passes through\nComplex C but was rejected for study in this paper because of its low S/N. However, high-velocity O VI and\nH I are both detected in Complex C in this direction\n(Wakker et al. 2003). Mrk 487, lying near Mrk 290 at\nl = 87.84\u25e6, b = 49.03\u25e6 but outside the contour delineating\nthe H I edge of Complex C, shows neither high-velocity\nH I or O VI, although there is an IVC (core IV15) seen\nat \u221285 km s\u22121 . The 3\u03c3 limit for high-velocity O VI toward Mrk 487 is N (O VI) < 14.13, unfortunately not a\nstrong constraint. An O VI non-detection would represent\nan important result, since in this case the interface surrounding Complex C would have to be thin enough not\nto be detected toward Mrk 487. 3C 249.1 is another sight\nline a few degrees off the edge of Complex C, in which\nneither high-velocity H I or O VI is seen. Borkowski et\nal. (1990) suggest a typical conductive interface thickness\nis 15 pc, which corresponds to 5\u2032 if one assumes the distance to Complex C is 10 kpc, so indeed we would expect\na sharp cut-off to the interface when looking off the side\nof the complex.\n9.3. NGC 5447 and NGC 5471\nNGC 5447 and NGC 5471 are two H II regions in the spiral galaxy M101, the sight line to which passes through a\nhole in Complex C. NGC 5447 has good FUSE data showing high-velocity O VI absorption, but no high-velocity H I\nis present in the Leiden-Dwingeloo Survey (Hartmann &\nBurton 1997). However, this is probably due a low column density of neutral gas, since the sensitive C II line\nshows extended absorption out to \u2248 \u2212200 km s\u22121 , suggesting N (H I) \u223c 1017 cm\u22122 . NGC 5471 has an O VI tail\nextending to \u2212150 km s\u22121 , and no high-velocity H I, but\nthe C II only extends to \u2212100 km s\u22121 . Difficult continua\nmake precise measurements difficult in these directions,\nbut the high-velocity O VI detections could be sampling\nthe Complex C interface.\n10. conclusions\n\nWe have investigated the properties of high ion absorption associated with HVC Complex C and its relation to\nlow ion absorption and emission using FUSE and HST\nabsorption line spectroscopy. We summarize the results of\n\n3. We find that in all five Complex C sight lines, the\nH I and O VI high-velocity components are centered\nwithin 20 km s\u22121 of one another, with an average\ndisplacement of < v\u0304O VI \u2212 v\u0304H I >= 3 \u00b1 12 km s\u22121 ;\nwe also measure < v\u0304O VI \u2212 v\u0304Si II >= 0 \u00b1 15 km s\u22121 .\nIn the directions along the high-velocity ridge where\nthe H I emission extends down to \u2212200 km s\u22121 , so\ndoes the O VI absorption, indicating a close kinematic correspondence between neutral and highly\nionized gas.\n4. We measure high ion column density ratios in\nthe high-velocity Complex C gas.\nAlong the\nPG 1259+593 sight line, N (Si IV)/N (O VI) =\n0.10 \u00b1 0.02, N (C IV)/N (O VI) = 0.35+0.05\n\u22120.06 , and\nN (N V)/N (O VI) < 0.07. The N (N V)/N (O VI)\nratio is 0.19+0.06\n\u22120.07 toward Mrk 279, < 0.11 toward\nMrk 876, and < 0.35 for the PG 1351+640 sight\nline (all upper limits are 3\u03c3).\n5. Collisional ionization equilibrium and photoionization by the extragalactic radiation field can be\nruled out as the origin of the highly ionized gas\nin Complex C. Our observed N (Si IV)/N (O VI),\nN (C IV)/N (O VI), and N (N V)/N (O VI) ionic ratios are most consistent with the conductive interface and turbulent mixing layer models. The shock\nionization and radiative cooling models are unable\nto simultaneously reproduce these ratios.\n6. We consider it likely that the O VI observed at HVC\nvelocities is produced in conductive or turbulent interfaces at the boundaries of Complex C. The ionic\ncolumn densities and their ratios between the highly\nionized species, the coincidence in central velocity of\nlow, (intermediate), and high ion absorption components, and the similar velocity extent of H I emission and O VI absorption all lend support to this\nhypothesis. More HST /STIS observations of Complex C sight lines would be crucial in discriminating\nbetween the CI and TML models; measurement of\nthe N (C IV)/N (O VI) ratio would be the crucial\ndiagnostic test\n\n\f14\n\nFox et al.\n7. The interface hypothesis, if correct, provides indirect evidence for the existence of a hot, low-density\nmedium surrounding and interacting with Complex C. This medium would take the form of an\nextended Galactic corona or a diffuse intergroup\nmedium, depending on the location of Complex C.\n8. We suggest an approximate method for scaling column density ratio predictions to low metallicity regions. However, there is considerable need for the\nionic ratio predictions of several ionization mechanism models to be updated to include new solar\n\nabundance measurements and applicability to lowmetallicity environments.\nThe STIS observations of PG 1259+593 were obtained\nthrough HST program 8695, with financial support from\nNASA Grant GO-08695.01-A from the Space Telescope\nScience Institute.

The survey was completed on a 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 grid with a 36\u2032 beam, 16 km s\u22121 velocity resolution (FWHM)\nand a 0.05 K detection limit. The sight lines we study in this paper are identified with stars. The contours represent column\ndensity levels of 0.2, 1.0 and 3.0 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 . The half circles represent those directions with an additional higher velocity H I\ncomponent, dubbed the high-velocity ridge.\n\n\fHighly Ionized Gas Surrounding Complex C\n\n21\n\nFig. 2.- FUSE absorption line profiles of Si II, C II, Ar I, S III, and O VI, GHRS N V data, and Effelsberg 100m radio\ntelescope H I 21 cm emission line observations (Wakker et al. 2001) toward Mrk 279 and Mrk 817. Gray shading is used to denote\nabsorption (or emission) in the velocity range of Complex C. Dashed lines indicate the peaks of the neutral hydrogen emission,\nand dotted lines indicate the position of our fitted continuum in each absorption line. Other absorption lines falling in the range\n\u2212400 < vLSR < 400 km s\u22121 of each line are identified with annotated tick marks. High-velocity highly ionized gas is detected in\nO VI along each sight line, and marginally detected in N V (3.2\u03c3) toward Mrk 279. What appears to be high-velocity N V toward\nMrk 817 is in fact a blend with intergalactic Ly\u03b1 at z = 0.0189.\n\n\f22\n\nFox et al.\n\nFig. 3.- FUSE absorption line profiles of Si II, C II, Ar I, S III, and O VI, STIS N V data, and Effelsberg 100m radio telescope\nH I 21 cm emission line data (Wakker et al. 2001) toward Mrk 876 and PG 1351+640.

Note that in the second panel, we have not included Si II \u03bb1526.707\nabsorption between v = \u221275 and 0 km s\u22121 , since the line is heavily saturated in this region.

Our\nMrk 279 and PG 1259+593 measurements are shown as colored regions, and the dot-dashed lines with arrows attached represent\nupper limits to the N (N V)/N (O VI) ratio for directions where no absolute N (N V) measurement could be made. The predictions\nof various models in two cases are shown: solar relative abundance ratios (light shaded regions), and assumed Complex C relative\nabundance ratios (dark shaded regions). The blue arrows connect the model predictions and show the size of the abundance\ncorrection we applied. Note that CIE = collisional ionization equilibrium, RC = radiative cooling , CI = conductive interfaces,\nTML = turbulent mixing layers, and SI = shock ionization.
