It\nis now well established that Landau quantization can modify the electrical properties of a\n2D system. With increasing B, usually Landau quantization may give rise to Shubnikov-de\nHaas (SdH) oscillations with the amplitude [1\u20135]\n\u25b3 \u03c1xx (B, T ) = 4\u03c10 exp(\u2212\u03c0/\u03bcB)D(B, T )\n\n(1)\n\nin the longitudinal resistivity \u03c1xx before the appearance of the integer quantum Hall effect\n(IQHE) [1, 6] at a low temperature T . Here \u03c10 is expected to be the longitudinal resistivity\n\u03c1xx at B = 0 while there may exsit deviations [7], \u03bc is thequnatum mobility, and D(B, T ) =\n2\u03c0 2 kB m\u2217 T /h\u0304eBsinh(2\u03c0 2 kB m\u2217 T /h\u0304eB) with m\u2217 , kB , and h\u0304 as the effective mass, Boltzmann\nconstant, and reduced Plank constant. It is worth mentioning that the SdH theory is derived\nbased on Landau quantization without considering the strong localization effects induced\nby the quantum interference. On the other hand, it is believed that both extended and\nlocalized states arising from such effects are key ingredients for describing the IQHE, in\nwhich the magnetic-field-induced transitions [8\u201312] are good examples of quantum phase\ntransitions. Such transitions occur as the Fermi energy passes through the extended states\nof Landau bands. In the global phase diagram (GPD) [8] of the quantum Hall effect, all\nthe magnetic-field-induced transitions are regarded equivalent though they are divided into\ntwo types, plateau-plateau (P-P) transitions and insulator-quantum Hall (I-QH) transitions\n[12].\nThere has been much interest in the IQHE at low magnetic fields [13\u201318]. A thorough\nunderstanding of the low-field IQHE should provide important information regarding the\nI-QH transition [8, 10, 11, 19]. In particular, whether a direct transition from the insulating\nregime (denoted by symbol 0) to a \u03bd \u2265 3 QH state can occur is an interesting, fundamental\nyet unsettled issue in the field of two-dimensional (2D) physics [13\u201315, 20\u201323]. Experimental\nand theoretical evidence for such a direct phase transition has been reported [13\u201315, 20\u2013\n22]. On the other hand, it was argued by Huckestein [16] that the observed direct I-QH\ntransition is not a real quantum phase transition, but a crossover from weak localization\nto strong localization regime in which Landau quantization becomes dominant. Within\nHuckestein's model, the onset of strong localization which causes the formation of a QH\n2\n\n\fstate should correspond to the direct I-QH transition. We note that in such a model, both\nweak localization and electron-electron interactions are considered as correction terms to\nthe classical Drude conductivities. It is well known that electron-electron (e-e) interactions\ncould play an important role in the metal-insulator transition (MIT) [24]. Moreover, in the\nseminal work of Dubi, Meir and Avishai [25], various transitions such as I-QH, MIT, and\npercolation transitions [26, 27] can be explained within a unifying model. Therefore, it is\ninteresting to probe electron-electron interaction effects with the presence of I-QH transition.\nMoreover, the effect of Landau quantization and onset of strong localization are fundamental\nissues regarding the direct I-QH transition.\nIn this communication, we report magneto transport measurements on a disordered 2DES.\nWith increasing B, the strength of the strong localization increases such that we can observe\nthe well-developed QH state of \u03bd = 2. However, the direct I-QH transition observed at\nB \u223c 2.29 T is not due to the onset of the strong localization because SdH formula is valid as\nB < 4.76 T. The T -dependences of the Hall resistivity \u03c1xy and Hall conductivity \u03c3xy show\nthe importance of e-e interactions to such a transition in our study.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nSample LM4645, a delta-doped quantum well with additional modulation doping, is used\nin this study. The following layer sequence was grown on a semi-insulating GaAs (100)\nsubstrate: 500 nm GaAs, 80 nm Al0.33 Ga0.67 As, 5 nm GaAs, Si delta-doping with a concentration of 3 x 1011 cm\u22122 , 15 nm GaAs, 20 nm Al0.33 Ga0.67 As, 40 nm Si-doped Al0.33 Ga0.67 As\nwith a doping concentration of 1018 cm\u22123 , finally 10 nm GaAs cap layer. Experiments\nwere performed in a top-loading He3 cryostat equipped with a superconducting magnet.\nFour-terminal magneto resistivities were measured using standard ac phase-sensitive lock-in\ntechniques. Magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2DES.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFigure 1 shows longitudinal and Hall resistivities (\u03c1xx and \u03c1xy ) as a function of magnetic\nfield B at various temperatures T . For 2.54 T \u2264 B \u2264 4.76 T , magneto-oscillations in \u03c1xx are\nobserved. In order to further study these oscillations, we plot their amplitudes as a function\n\n3\n\n\fof 1/B as shown in Fig. 2. As shown in this figure, there is a good fit to Eq. 1, and thus these\nmagneto-oscillations are ascribed to SdH oscillations. From the observed SdH oscillations,\nthe carrier density of the 2DES is measured to be 3.97\u00d71015 m\u22122 . According to the fit shown\nin Fig. 2, the quantum mobility is estimated to be \u2248 0.19 m2 /Vs. Since the SdH theory is\nderived based on Landau quantization without considering strong localization effects, it is\nbelieved that high-field strong localization effects leading to the IQHE are not significant\nfor B \u2264 4.76 T. The resistance peak at around 6 T appears to move with increasing B.\nThis movement cannot be described within the standard SdH theory and the measured\namplitudes at B = 4.76 T can be affected by this movement. Hence the data point at\nB = 4.76 T in Fig. 2 are in open symbols whilst it can be fitted to Eq. (1).\nThe Hall slope at low B increases with decreasing T , and we can see from Fig. 1 that\nthe curves of \u03c1xy at T = 0.33 K and T = 1.242 K do not collapse into a single curve as\nB is smaller than 4 T. Such a change on the Hall slope does not result from a change in n\nsince n determined from the SdH oscillations is T -independent over the whole measurement\nrange. As will be described later, such T -dependent \u03c1xy can be ascribed to electron-electron\ninteractions.\nAs shown in the inset to figure 1, for 7.6 T \u2264 B \u2264 10.6 T, we can see a well-quantized\n\u03bd = 2 Hall plateau with corresponding vanishing resistivity. Therefore the strong localization\neffect which gives rise to the formation of the quantum Hall state should occur with increasing\nB.\nIn order to further study the strong localization effect in our system, we follow the\nseminal work of Shahar [12] as described as follows. First, as shown in Fig. 3. we convert\nthe measured \u03c1xx and \u03c1xy into \u03c3xx and \u03c3xy by matrix inversion\n\u03c3xx =\n\u03c3xy =\n\n\u03c1xx\n,\n+ \u03c12xy\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c1xy\n.\n+ \u03c12xy\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c12xx\n\u03c12xx\n\nUsing the following equations, we then obtain the conductivity of the topmost Landau level\nby subtracting from the conductivity data the contribution of the lowest, full Landau level.\nt\n\u03c3xx\n= \u03c3xx ,\nt\n\u03c3xy\n= \u03c3xy \u2212\n\n4\n\n2e2\n.\nh\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\n\ft\nt\nFinally we convert \u03c3xx\nand \u03c3xy\ninto the corresponding resisitivities for the topmost Landau\n\nlevels \u03c1txx and \u03c1txy . Such results are shown in Fig. 4. We can clearly see a clear crossing point\nin \u03c1txx at around 5.2 T, which is denoted by a vertical dotted line. Such a T -independent\npoint can be ascribed to the formation of the extended states under the existence of the\nlocalized states [12]. Since both extended and localized states are due to strong localization\neffects leading to the IQHE, such effects should become significant as B \u2265 5.2 T in our\nsystem. On the other hand, at B < 4.76 T the validity of SdH formula reveals that the\nstrength of strong localization is weak. Therefore, the onset of the strong localization occurs\nas B = 4.76 T \u223c 5.2 T.\nIt has been pointed out that the strong localization occurs at the magnetic field B \u223c 1/\u03bc,\nnear which the localization length changes quickly [16]. Just as mentioned in the above,\nthe mobility \u03bc = 0.19 m2 /Vs and thus the onset of the strong localization is expected as\nB \u223c 5.3 T. Such a magnetic field is close to the estimation based on SdH formula and the\ncrossing point in \u03c1txx . We note that the temperature-independent point in \u03c1txx is close to the\nresistance quantum\n\nh\n2e2\n\nas expected for the topmost Landau level [12]. In addition, as shown\n\nin Fig. 4, \u03c1txy does not deviate much from the expected value\n\nh\n2e2\n\nat the lowest temperature\n\nT = 0.33 K as B < 5.2 T.\nWe can see from Fig. 1 that the 2DES behaves as an insulator as B < Bc \u2261 2.29 T in\nthe sense that \u03c1xx increases with decreasing T . The longitudinal resistivity \u03c1xx is almost\nindependent of T at Bc . Since there is no QH state of the lowest integer filling factor 1 or 2\nnear Bc , the 2DES undergoes a direct I-QH transition at Bc [13, 15]. The filling factor \u03bd is\nabout 8 near Bc , so the observed transition is a 0-8 transition [15, 20]. If such a transition is\ndue to the onset of the strong localizationc [16], Bc should be within B = 4.76 T \u223c 5.2 T as\nmentioned above. In our study, however, Bc is at a much lower magnetic field B = 2.29 T.\nTherefore, the observed direct I-QH transition is not due to the onset of strong localization.\nIt has been shown that by converting the measured \u03c1xx and \u03c1xy into longitudinal and\ntransverse conductivities \u03c3xx and \u03c3xy , one can provide further information on the I-QH\ntransition [11, 28]. Figure 3 shows converted \u03c3xx and \u03c3xy as a function of B. We can\nsee that \u03c3xy is T -independent over a wide range of magnetic field (0 T\u2264 B \u2264 2.8 T),\nspanning from the insulating region to the QH-like regime. On the other hand, as shown\nin the inset to Fig. 3, the Hall slope RH shows an approximately lnT dependence. The\ndeviation from the linear fit through the full symbols can be ascribed to current heating.\n5\n\n\fAs the current is decreased from 20 nA to 10 nA (full circle in blue), we are able to restore\nthe lnT dependence at low T [23]. The observed lnT dependence of RH does not result\nfrom a change in n since n determined from the SdH oscillations is T -independent over the\nwhole measurement range. Therefore, the observed T -indepndent \u03c3xy , together with the\nlnT -dependent \u03c1xy can be ascribed to electron-electron interaction, and we note that the\ncorrections resulting from such an interaction have been discussed in the literature [30]. Our\nexperimental result therefore supports that the direct I-QH transition is not always due to\nthe onset of strong localization when the e-e interaction is significant.\nInterestingly, whilst there is a crossing field at Bc in \u03c1xx , there is no corresponding\ncrossing point in \u03c3xx [29]. The reason for this is that \u03c1xy shows logarithmic dependence on\nT . Therefore according to Eq. 2, there is no corresponding crossing point in \u03c3xx even there\nexists a T -independent point in \u03c1xx .\nTo further study the direct I-QH transition and onset of the strong localization leading to\nthe IQHE, we have re-analyzed the data published in Ref. [23], where the studied sample is\nalmost identical except a different delta-doping concentration of 5 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 . There also\nexsits a crossing point in \u03c1txx ast B \u223c 1/\u03bc, near which the onset of the strong localization is\nexpected. The direct I-QH transition, however, appears at a much lower magnetic field B <\n1/(2\u03bc) and does not correspond to the onset of strong localization. Tilted-field measurements\nshow that the sample studied in Ref. [23] is two-dimensional such that the direct I-QH\ntransition and features of Landau quantization only depend on the perpendicular component\nof the applied B.\nIt has been reported in some case when \u03c1xx approaches zero and the strong localization\neffects may occur, the large resistance oscillations can be still well approximated by the\nconventional SdH formula [17, 18]. In this case, rising background resistance [17] needs\nto be introduced while such background resistance does not occur in our system. In our\nsystem, the amplitudes of the resistance oscillations are a lot smaller than the non-oscillating\nbackground as B \u2264 4.76 T, under which the resistance minima are much bigger than zero.\nBased on the tight-binding model, Nita, Aldea and Zittartz [31] have predicted that\nresistance oscillations can cover the I-QH transition. There exists also experimental evidence\nfor this prediction [32]. We note that in this case, e-e interaction effects are not significant\nsince \u03c1xy is nominally T -independent. It may be possible that the existence of e-e interactions\nmay dictate the observation of SdH-like oscillations spanning from the insulating regime to\n6\n\n\fthe QH-like regime.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have performed magneto transport measurements on a weaklydisordered 2DES. With increasing magnetic field, the 2DES undergoes a direct 0-8 I-QH\ntransition at a crossing field Bc . For B > Bc , magneto-oscillations governed by conventional\nShubnikov-de Haas theory are observed. Since strong localization effect is not considered in\nthe SdH theory, our results explicitly demonstrate that the direct I-QH transition does not\ncorrespond to the onset of strong localization. The observed nominally T -independent \u03c3xy\nspanning from the insulating regime to the SdH regime, together with the observed logarithmic T -dependent Hall slope demonstrate that electron-electron interactions, rather than\nthe weak localization effects, are the dominant mechanism near the direct I-QH transition\nin our study.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was funded by the NSC, Taiwan.
