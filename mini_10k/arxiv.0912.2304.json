Introduction\nOne of the major objectives in the theory of noncommutative projective geometry is the classification of\nnoncommutative surfaces. The goal of this paper is to study, from a ring-theoretic standpoint, some surfaces\nwhich are birational to the generic noncommutative projective plane, the Sklyanin P2 . We first describe\nour main results, and then explain in more detail how they are motivated by the classification project. In\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 14A22, 16P40, 16S38, 16W50, 18E15.\nKey words and phrases. Noncommutative projective geometry, noncommutative surfaces, noetherian graded rings, Sklyanin\nalgebra, noncommutative blowup.\nThe author was partially supported by NSF grants DMS-0600834 and DMS-0900981.\n1\n\n\fparticular, we discuss at the end of the introduction how our results relate to Van den Bergh's blowing up\nconstruction in [VdB].\nWe first review a few standard definitions. Fix an algebraically closed field k. In this paper, we are\nL\nprimarily interested in N-graded associative k-algebras A = \u221e\nn=0 An which are connected (A0 = k) and\n\nfinitely graded (finitely generated as a k-algebra), as well as domains. The Gelfand-Kirillov (GK) dimension\n\nof A can be defined, in this graded setting, by GK(A) = 1 + lim supn\u22650 logn (dimk An ). We assume that\nA is a connected finitely graded (cfg) domain with integer GK-dimension for the rest of this introduction.\nAny such A has a graded quotient ring Qgr (A) formed by inverting the Ore set of all nonzero homogeneous\nelements, as well as the usual Goldie quotient ring Q(A) formed by inverting all nonzero elements. Domains\nA, A\u2032 with Q = Q(A) = Q(A\u2032 ) are equivalent orders if there are nonzero elements p1 , p2 , q1 , q2 \u2208 Q such that\np1 Ap2 \u2286 A\u2032 and q1 A\u2032 q2 \u2286 A; a maximal order is a subring A of Q maximal under inclusion among orders in\nan equivalence class.\nA construction that plays a fundamental role in our results is that of a twisted homogeneous coordinate\nring. Such a ring B(X, L, \u03c3) is built out of the data of a projective k-scheme X, an invertible sheaf L on\nX, and an automorphism \u03c3 : X \u2192 X. Putting L0 = OX and Ln = L \u2297 \u03c3 \u2217 (L) \u2297 * * * \u2297 (\u03c3 n\u22121 )\u2217 (L) for\nL\u221e\nn \u2265 1, then we define B = B(X, L, \u03c3) = n=0 H0 (X, Ln ), with a multiplication defined on graded pieces by\nm\n\nf \u22c6g = f *(\u03c3 m )\u2217 (g) for f \u2208 Bm , g \u2208 Bn . Here, (\u03c3 m )\u2217 : H0 (X, Ln ) \u2192 H0 (X, L\u03c3n ) is the map on global sections\nm\n\ninduced by pullback by \u03c3 m , and * indicates the multiplication map H0 (X, Lm )\u2297H0 (X, L\u03c3n ) \u2192 H0 (X, Lm+n ).\nWe only consider this construction under an additional condition that L is \u03c3-ample, which ensures that B\nis noetherian. See Section 2 for the details.\nNoncommutative projective geometry might be said to have begun with a project of Artin and Schelter to\nclassify certain graded algebras of dimension 3 which are analogs of commutative polynomial rings (naturally,\nthese are called AS-regular algebras today). We omit the technical definition of AS-regular, which is not\nneeded for this paper. The classification, which was completed with Tate and Van den Bergh in [ATV1],\n[ATV2], in fact necessitated the development of the concept of a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring. We\nconcentrate here on those regular algebras with three degree-1 generators and three quadratic relations,\nwhich correspond geometrically to noncommutative P2 's. The classification of these includes the linear\nregular algebras, which have the form B(P2 , O(1), \u03c3), but the more interesting examples are the elliptic\nones. Such an elliptic regular algebra A always has a normal element g \u2208 A3 such that A/Ag \u223c\n= B(E, L, \u03c3)\nfor some degree 3 divisor E \u2286 P2 , and with L = O(1)|E . In fact, we restrict our attention here to what\nis in many ways the most interesting regular algebra, the generic Sklyanin algebra S (see Section 4 for a\ndefinition by presentation). In this case, g is central, E is a nonsingular elliptic curve, and the automorphism\n\u03c3 : E \u2192 E has infinite order.\nThe main objects of study in this paper will be certain subalgebras of S generated in degree 3. It is\nL\nconvenient to work instead in the 3-Veronese T = S (3) =\nn\u22650 S3n , and construct degree-1-generated\n2\n\n\fsubalgebras of T . Now g \u2208 T1 and T /T g \u223c\n= B(E, L3 , \u03c3 3 ). Let x indicate the image of x \u2208 S under\nthe quotient map S 7\u2192 S/Sg. Given any effective Weil divisor D on E with 0 \u2264 deg D \u2264 7, we let\nV (D) = {x \u2208 T1 |x \u2208 H0 (E, ID \u2297 L3 )}, where here ID = OE (\u2212D). In other words, V (D) consists exactly\nof those global sections of L3 which vanish along the divisor D. We define R(D) = khV (D)i \u2286 T . One goal\nof the paper is to prove that the rings R(D) have many nice properties (with the notable exception of finite\nglobal dimension). We summarize these in the following theorem. The definitions of the properties involved\nare reviewed in Section 2.\nTheorem 1.1. Let R = R(D) \u2286 T as above, where D is an effective divisor on E of degree d, with 0 \u2264 d \u2264 7.\n(1) (Theorems 5.2, 5.4) R/Rg \u223c\n= B(E, N , \u03c3 3 ), where N = ID \u2297 L3 is a \u03c3 3 -ample invertible sheaf on E\nt2 + (7 \u2212 d)t + 1\nof degree 9 \u2212 d. The Hilbert series of R is hR (t) =\nand Qgr (R) = Qgr (T ). R has\n(1 \u2212 t)3\ninfinite global dimension.\n(2) (Theorems 6.3, 6.7) R is strongly noetherian, satisfies the Artin-Zhang \u03c7 conditions, is AuslanderGorenstein and Cohen Macaulay. The noncommutative projective scheme proj- R has cohomological\ndimension 2. R is a maximal order.\n(3) (Theorem 10.4) There is a homogeneous ideal I of R with GK R/I \u2264 1 which is essentially minimal\namong such ideals in the following sense: given a homogeneous ideal J of R with GK R/J \u2264 1, then\nJ \u2287 I\u2265n for some n \u2265 0.\nWe make a comment on the significance of part (3) of the theorem, which is actually the part on which we\nexpend the most effort in the paper. The generic Sklyanin algebra S and its Veronese ring T are known to\nhave no homogeneous factor rings of GK-dimension 1. The rings R(D) sometimes do, so the point of part\n(3) above is that such factor rings can be strongly controlled. This fact is needed in the proof of our main\nresult, which can be found in Section 10. It classifies degree 1-generated orders in T , as follows.\nTheorem 1.2. Let V \u2286 T1 and let A = khV i \u2286 T . Assume that Qgr (A) = Qgr (T ).\n(1) There is a unique effective divisor D on E with 0 \u2264 deg D \u2264 7 such that A \u2286 R(D) with A and\nR(D) equivalent orders. In particular, the rings R(D) are exactly the degree-1 generated subalgebras\nof T which are maximal orders in Qgr (T ).\n(2) If A is noetherian, then in part (1) A \u2286 R(D) is a finite ring extension. If g \u2208 A, then A is indeed\nnoetherian.\nWhen g 6\u2208 A in the preceding theorem, then it can happen that A is not noetherian and A \u2286 R(D) is not\na finite ring extension; see Section 11. Also, similar methods can be used to analyze the subalgebras of S\ngenerated in degree 1, which was in fact the original project we attempted. Since dimk S1 = 3, the only\ninteresting degree-1-generated subalgebras are A = khV i, where V \u2286 S1 with dimk V = 2. We show in\nTheorem 12.2 below that for such an A, either the 3-Veronese ring A(3) is equal to the ring R(D) for a\ndivisor D of degree 3, or else A equals S in all large degrees.\n3\n\n\fNext, we explain how our results relate to the project to classify noncommutative projective surfaces, for\nwhich we need to review a few more definitions. See [SV] for a survey of the field. If A is a cfg domain\nwith GK(A) = d + 1, then informally we think of A as corresponding to a d-dimensional noncommutative\nprojective variety. Let Gr-A be the category of Z-graded right A-modules M , and let Tors-A be the full\nsubcategory of graded modules M such that for every m \u2208 M , mA\u2265n = 0 for some n. The quotient category\nQgr-A = Gr-A/ Tors-A is called the quasi-scheme associated to A. The graded quotient ring Qgr (A) is\nisomorphic to a skew-Laurent ring D[t, t\u22121 ; \u03c3], for some division ring D and automorphism \u03c3 : D \u2192 D. We\ncall D the (skew) field of functions of A. In general, the ring-theoretic version of the problem of classification\nof noncommutative surfaces has two parts. First, what are the (D, \u03c3) which occur in the graded quotient\nrings of cfg domains A of dimension 3? Second, for a given Q = D[t, t\u22121 ; \u03c3] where D has transcendence\ndegree 2, can one classify in some way the algebras A with Qgr (A) = Q?\nWe say that A is birationally commutative if its skew field of functions D is actually a field. The second\nquestion above has a quite satisfactory answer in the birationally commutative case. If B = B(X, L, \u03c3) is\na twisted homogeneous coordinate ring with X an integral surface and L \u03c3-ample, then Q = Qgr (B) \u223c\n=\nk(X)[t, t\u22121 ; \u03c3\ne], where \u03c3\ne is the automorphism on the field of rational functions k(X) induced by pullback by\n\n\u03c3. Noetherian cfg algebras A with Qgr (A) = Qgr (B) have now been classified [RS], [Si]. In large degrees,\nsuch A are either twisted homogeneous coordinate rings over varieties Y birational to X, or one of a few\nkinds of closely related subrings of them (na\u0131\u0308ve blowup rings, ADC rings, or idealizer rings in either of these.)\nMoreover, geometrically, the quasi-scheme Qgr-B of a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring B(Y, M, \u03c4 ) is\nequivalent to Qcoh Y , the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on Y . The quasi-schemes of the other kinds of\nexamples A behave as further blowups of the categories Qcoh Y in some generalized noncommutative sense\n(\"na\u0131\u0308ve blowups\").\nThe main theorem of this paper, Theorem 1.2, is an attempt to begin to classify some algebras which are\nnot birationally commutative. It is natural to start by considering rings A with Qgr (A) = Qgr (S) for the\ngeneric Sklyanin algebra S, since this is one of the most well-studied cfg algebras of dimension 3. Even in the\ncommutative classification of surfaces, one concentrates first on nonsingular surfaces, so it is reasonable to\nfocus our attention here on maximal orders: being a maximal order is the noncommutative analog of being\nintegrally closed.\nThe intuition from the commutative case leads one to expect that the quasi-schemes of the algebras in such\na classification should be related to Qgr-S via some kind of blowup procedure. In fact, the quasi-schemes\nQgr-R(D) are the same as certain iterated noncommutative blowups of the Sklyanin P2 , in the sense of Van\nden Bergh's theory [VdB]. Starting with the Sklyanin algebra S and a divisor D of degree at most 8 on E,\nVan den Bergh's construction yields a blowup of the Sklyanin P2 along the divisor D (see [VdB, Section 11]);\nthis is a quasi-scheme Qgr-A(D) for some ring A(D). Van den Bergh proves that Qgr-A(D) has many of\nthe same formal properties as a commutative blowup, when D is in general position [VdB, Theorem 11.1.3].\n4\n\n\fVan den Bergh's work is primarily category-theoretic, essentially defining a blowup by constructing a Rees\nring over a quasi-scheme, working in an appropriate category of functors. Because the details are rather\nintricate, it is not obvious that the ring A(D) is isomorphic to our ring R(D). Only recently, after most\nof the work in this paper was completed, did we fully verify that this is indeed the case. We postpone the\ndemonstration of this to a future paper, in which the connections between our results and Van den Bergh's\ncan be more fully explored. In the meantime, we thought would be most helpful to the reader to keep our\npresentation here entirely independent of [VdB]. We should remark, however, that once one knows that the\nrings appearing in [VdB] are the same, some of the most basic properties of the rings R(D), in particular\nthe Hilbert series (Theorem 1.1(1)), follow in a quite different way from Van den Bergh's methods.\nTo close, we discuss some questions for future study.\nQuestion 1.3. Can one classify all cfg maximal orders A inside the generic Sklyanin algebra S with Q =\nQgr (A) = Qgr (S (n) ) for some n? More generally, can we classify all cfg maximal orders in Qgr (S (n) )?\nSo far, we have classified only those subalgebras A of S generated in degree 1 or 3. Based on the connection\nwith [VdB], there should also be subalgebras of S corresponding to blowups at 8 points, which have presumably fallen outside the scope of our results in this paper because they will not be generated in any single\ndegree. It seems possible that there are no other subalgebras of S which are maximal orders, except those\nthat have a Veronese ring in common with one of these blowups at 8 or fewer points. To answer the more\ngeneral second question, one needs to find first the \"minimal models\" for this birational class. For example,\npresumably the regular algebra with 2 generators and 2 cubic relations of Sklyanin type (the \"Sklyanin\nP1 \u00d7 P1 \") is also contained in this quotient ring, and so one also has it and its subalgebras as examples.\nQuestion 1.4. If one replaces the generic Sklyanin algebra S by other non-PI AS-regular algebras of dimension 3, can one prove theorems analogous to the ones in this paper, or ultimately classify all cfg algebras\nwhich are maximal orders with the same quotient ring?\nQuestion 1.5. What is a presentation of the ring R(D) by generators and relations?\nAnswering this final question would be useful in order to better understand the deformation theory of these\nblowup algebras.\nAcknowledgments.

Background and twisted homogeneous coordinate rings\nIn this section, we review some definitions and basic background material, including some facts about\ntwisted homogeneous coordinate rings B(X, L, \u03c3). Throughout this paper, k will stand for an algebraically\n5\n\n\fclosed field. All algebras A of interest will be cfg k-algebras, as defined in the introduction. We make no\nassumptions on the cardinality of k, but if the reader is happy to assume that k is uncountable, a few later\narguments can be streamlined slightly. In general, the hypotheses and notation in force in each particular\nsection will be announced near the beginning of that section.\nFor completeness, we review most of the definitions we will use in the paper in this section. Some of\nthese we will need only incidentally later, however, so the expert reader might wish to skip this section and\nrefer back to it when necessary. We begin by reviewing the theory of noncommutative projective schemes,\nwhich was developed in [AZ1]. For convenience, assume that A is a noetherian cfg k-algebra in the following\ndefinitions. Let Gr-A be the category of Z-graded right A-modules. The general convention is to use a\nlowercase name to indicate the subcategory of noetherian objects in a category. For example, gr-A \u2286 Gr-A\nis the full subcategory of finitely generated Z-graded A-modules. Let Tors-A \u2286 Gr-A be the subcategory of\nmodules M with the property that for every m \u2208 M , mA\u2265n = 0 for some n \u2265 1. As in the introduction, the\nquotient category Qgr-A = Gr-A/ Tors-A is called the quasi-scheme associated to A. Let \u03c0 : Gr-A \u2192 Qgr-A\nbe the canonical quotient functor. A review of the formalities of quotient categories can be found in [AZ1].\nIn the case at hand, one may think of qgr-A as the category of tails of modules; in other words, two modules\nM, N \u2208 gr-A become isomorphic in qgr-A if and only if M\u2265n \u223c\n= N\u2265n for some n. The noncommutative\nprojective scheme associated to A is the pair proj- A = (qgr-A, \u03c0(AA )); it remembers the distinguished object\n\u03c0(A), which plays the role of the structure sheaf. For M \u2208 gr-A and n \u2208 Z, M [n] \u2208 gr-A is the same module\nas M but with the grading shifted so that M [n]i = Mi+n for all i \u2208 Z.\nLet k = kA be the right module A/A\u22651 .\ndimk ExtjA (k, M )\n\nThe noetherian algebra A satisfies \u03c7i (on the right) if\n\n< \u221e for all M \u2208 gr-A and all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 i. A satisfies \u03c7 (on the right) if it satisfies \u03c7i\n\nfor all i \u2265 1. Of course, one defines the left \u03c7-conditions analogously. The cohomology groups of an object\nM \u2208 qgr-A are defined by Hi (M) = Extiqgr-A (\u03c0(A), M) for all i \u2265 0. The cohomological dimension of proj- A\nis cd(proj- A) = min{i| Hi (M) 6= 0 for some M \u2208 qgr-A}.\nNext, we review definitions related to Hilbert series and growth of modules. Let A be any cfg k-algebra.\nAny M \u2208 gr-A has a Hilbert function fM (n) : Z \u2192 N, defined by fM (n) = dimk Mn ; the Hilbert series of\nP\nM is the corresponding formal Laurent power series hM (t) = n\u2208Z (dimk Mn )tn . We sometimes use the\nP\nP\nfollowing partial order on Hilbert series:\nan tn \u2264 bn tn if an \u2264 bn for all n. In this graded setting, we can\ndefine the GK-dimension of a nonzero module M \u2208 gr-A as GK(M ) = [lim supn\u2192\u221e logn fM (n)] + 1. The\n\nmodule M \u2208 gr-A has a Hilbert polynomial if there is a polynomial q(x) \u2208 Q[x] such that q(n) = fM (n) for\nall n \u226b 0; in this case, writing f (x) = am xm + * * * + a0 with am 6= 0, then GK M = m + 1 and m!am is an\nL\ninteger, the multiplicity of M . For any d \u2265 1, we have the dth Veronese ring of A, A(d) = n\u22650 And , which\n\nis graded by the index n, unless stated otherwise. A module M \u2208 gr-A has a Hilbert quasi-polynomial of\nL\nperiod d for some d \u2265 1, if n\u22650 Mi+nd has a Hilbert polynomial as an A(d) -module for each 0 \u2264 i \u2264 d \u2212 1.\n\nWe say that A is generated in degree 1 if it is generated as a k-algebra by A1 . Given a cfg k-algebra A which\n6\n\n\fis generated in degree 1, we say that M \u2208 gr-A is a point module if M is cyclic and hM (t) = 1/(1 \u2212 t). A\nmodule M \u2208 gr-A with GK(M ) = d is d-critical if GK(M/N ) < d for all nonzero submodules N \u2286 M .\nThe k-algebra A is strongly noetherian if A \u2297k C is noetherian for all commutative noetherian k-algebras\nC. As usual, a ring extension A \u2286 B is finite if BA and\n\nAB\n\nare finitely generated A-modules. We will\n\noften use below the graded Nakayama lemma, which states that M \u2208 Gr-A is finitely generated if and only\nif dimk M/M A\u22651 < \u221e (and, in fact, X \u2286 M is a generating subset if and only if X spans M/M A\u22651 as a\nk-vector space.)\nThe last definitions we review are some important homological properties which involve ungraded modules.\nFor a right A-module M , define j(MA ) = inf{i| Exti (M, A) 6= 0} \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e}, which is called the grade of M .\nThe grade of a left module is defined analogously. A right module M satisfies the Auslander condition if for\nall i \u2265 0 and all left submodules N \u2286 Exti (M, A), one has j(A N ) \u2265 i; the definition of Auslander for a left\nmodule is symmetric. The ring A is Auslander-Gorenstein if the modules AA and A A have the same finite\ninjective dimension d, and every finitely generated left and right A-module satisfies the Auslander condition.\nSuppose in addition that GK(A) is an integer. Then A is Cohen-Macaulay if GK(M ) + j(M ) = GK(A) for\nall finitely generated left and right modules M .\nNow we move on to a review of twisted homogeneous coordinate rings. Recall that in the introduction,\nL\nwe defined the twisted homogeneous coordinate ring B(X, L, \u03c3) = n\u22650 H0 (X, Ln ) for a given projective\n\nk-scheme X, invertible sheaf L, and automorphism \u03c3 : X \u2192 X. We now give a few more details about\nthis construction; for more information, see [AV] and [Ke2]. For any coherent sheaf F on X we adopt the\nnotation F \u03c3 for the pullback \u03c3 \u2217 F , so in this notation we have Ln = L \u2297 L\u03c3 \u2297 . . . L\u03c3\n\nn\u22121\n\nfor n \u2265 1. The sheaf\n\nL is called \u03c3-ample if for any coherent sheaf F on X, Hi (X, F \u2297 Ln ) = 0 for all i \u2265 1 and n \u226b 0. We always\nassume that L is \u03c3-ample when constructing a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring.\nMany of the definitions discussed earlier play out nicely when A = B = B(X, L, \u03c3) is a twisted homogeneous coordinate ring, where L is \u03c3-ample. If X is integral (as it will be in all of the applications in\nthis paper), the graded quotient ring of B may be explicitly described as Qgr (B) \u223c\n= k(X)[t, t\u22121 ; \u03c3], where\n\u03c3 : k(X) \u2192 k(X) is the map induced by pullback of rational functions by \u03c3 : X \u2192 X. In this case, as\nmentioned already in the introduction, the quasi-scheme Qgr-B is equivalent as a category to Qcoh X, the\ncategory of quasi-coherent sheaves on X [AV, Theorem 1.3]. Restricting to noetherian objects for convenience, the equivalence is given explicitly by the functor G : coh X \u2192 qgr-B with formula\n(2.1)\n\nM\nG(F ) = \u03c0(\nH0 (X, F \u2297 Ln )).\nn\u22650\n\nFor later reference, we record here some other well-known properties of twisted homogeneous coordinate\nrings which follow quickly from the literature.\nLemma 2.2. Let X be a projective scheme, \u03c3 : X \u2192 X an automorphism, and L a \u03c3-ample invertible sheaf\non X. Let B = B(X, L, \u03c3).\n7\n\n\f(1) B is strongly noetherian.\n(2) B satisfies \u03c7 on the left and right, and cd(proj- B) = dim X.\n(3) If X is a integral nonsingular curve, then every module M \u2208 gr-B has a Hilbert polynomial of the\nform dimk Mn = an + b for n \u226b 0, some a, b \u2208 Z with a \u2265 0.\n(4) if X = E is a nonsingular elliptic curve, then B is Auslander-Gorenstein of dimension 2 and CohenMacaulay.\nProof. (1) This is [ASZ, Proposition 4.13].\n(2) These results are implicit in Artin and Zhang's original paper [AZ1] but are not stated in this way.\nThe fact that B satisfies \u03c7 follows from [AZ1, Theorem 4.5, Corollary 7.5, and p. 262] and the fact that L\nis \u03c3-ample. For a working out of the details, see Keeler's thesis [Ke1, Proposition 2.5.3, Proposition 2.5.8].\nSince the category equivalence (2.1) takes OX to \u03c0(B), it also shows that cd(proj- B) is the same as\nthe cohomological dimension of the scheme X, i.e. max{i| Hi (X, F ) 6= 0 for some F \u2208 coh X}, which it is\nwell-known is equal to dim X for a projective scheme X.\n(3) This follows quickly from (2.1) and the Riemann-Roch theorem.\n(4) This is [Lev, Theorem 6.6], except that Levasseur assumes the restriction deg L \u2265 3, so that L is very\nample. But this restriction is only used in the proof of a different part of the theorem showing that every\ngraded B-module has a Hilbert polynomial (and the restriction is also unnecessary to prove that, as we saw\nin (3)).\n\n\u0003\n3. Twisted homogeneous coordinate rings over an elliptic curve\n\nTheorem 1.1 from the introduction shows that the rings R of main interest in this paper will all have a\ncentral element g such that R/Rg \u223c\n= B(E, L, \u03c3), where E is a nonsingular elliptic curve and \u03c3 has infinite\norder. Thus these special twisted homogeneous coordinate rings will play an important role below, and in\nthis section we prove some results that are particular to this special case.\nFor the rest of this section we restrict to the following setup. Let E be a nonsingular elliptic curve with\nfixed basepoint p0 for the group structure. Let \u03c3 : E \u2192 E be an automorphism given by translation x 7\u2192 x+r\nin the group structure, for some point r of infinite order in the group. It is standard that any automorphism\nof infinite order on an elliptic curve is such a translation, so we are really working with any infinite order\nautomorphism of E. The notation of this paragraph is fixed for the rest of this section.\nWe will freely use basic properties of nonsingular curves and divisors on them which can be found in\n[Ha, Chapter IV], for example the Riemann-Roch theorem. Another basic result we use frequently is Abel's\ntheorem: two Weil divisors D, D\u2032 on E are linearly equivalent (D \u223c D\u2032 ) if and only if deg D = deg D\u2032 and\nD and D\u2032 give the same result when summed in the group structure of E. Note that the symbol + is used\nboth for the group structure of E and for addition in the group Div E of Weil divisors of E; the meaning\nwill be clear from context.\n8\n\n\fThe property of \u03c3-ampleness is easy to understand on curves; in particular, an invertible sheaf L on E is\n\u03c3-ample if and only if L is ample, in other words if and only if L has positive degree [Ke2, Theorem 1.3]. Our\nfirst goal is to show that B(E, L, \u03c3) is generated in degree 1 as long as L does not have very small degree.\nThis is similar to the results in [ATV1, Section 7]; in fact, some parts of the next lemma also follow from\n[ATV1, Proposition 7.17, Lemma 7.21], but we give a full proof for the reader's convenience.\nLemma 3.1.\n\n(1) Let L and M be invertible sheaves on E with deg L \u2265 2 and deg M \u2265 2. Consider\n\nthe natural map \u03c6 : H0 (E, L) \u2297 H0 (E, M) \u2192 H0 (E, L \u2297 M). The map \u03c6 is surjective unless\ndeg L = deg M = 2 and L \u223c\n= M, in which case dimk im \u03c6 = 3.\n(2) Let L be an invertible sheaf on E with deg L \u2265 2. Then B = B(E, L, \u03c3) is generated in degree 1.\nProof. If L \u223c\n= M with deg L = 2, then the natural map is clearly not surjective. For, in that case we might\nas well assume that M = L, and dimk H0 (E, L) = 2 and dimk H0 (E, L\u22972 ) = 4 by Riemann-Roch. Then\nwriting H0 (E, L) = kx + ky, we have \u03c6(x \u2297 y) = \u03c6(y \u2297 x), and so dimk im \u03c6 \u2264 3. It is easy to check that in\nfact we have equality here, as asserted.\nIf L \u223c\n= M where deg L \u2265 3, again we may assume that M = L. Then the surjectivity of \u03c6 is a special case\nof the standard result that any invertible sheaf of degree at least 2g + 1 on a curve of genus g is normally\ngenerated. See, for example, [Lz1, Definition 1.8.50 and Theorem 1.8.53].\nFinally, assume that M 6\u223c\n= L, where by switching the sheaves if necessary we can assume that deg L \u2264\ndeg M. In this case, we show a slightly stronger result. It is well-known that any globally generated invertible\nsheaf L on E is generated by two sections. We claim that choosing any two sections x, y \u2208 H0 (E, L) which\ngenerate the sheaf L, then putting W = kx+ky we even have \u03c6(W \u2297H0 (E, M)) = H0 (E, L\u2297M). Considering\nthe exact sequence\n0 \u2192 K \u2192 W \u2297 OE \u2192 L \u2192 0,\nit is clear that K is also invertible, and in fact it follows from a consideration of determinants ([Ha, Exercise\nII.5.16(d)]) that K \u223c\n= L\u22121 . Tensoring with M and taking the cohomology long exact sequence, we see that\nto prove the claim it suffices to prove that H1 (E, L\u22121 \u2297 M) = 0. But since N = L\u22121 \u2297 M has N 6\u223c\n= OE and\ndeg N \u2265 0, it is standard that H1 (E, N ) = 0 [Ha, Section IV.1].\n(2) It suffices to show that the map\nH0 (E, L) \u2297 H0 (E, L\u03c3n ) \u2192 H0 (E, Ln+1 )\nis surjective for all n \u2265 1. This follows immediately from part (1), unless deg L = 2, n = 1, and L\u03c3 \u223c\n= L.\nBut since \u03c3 is translation by a point of infinite order on E, \u03c3 does not fix the linear equivalence class of any\nnonzero effective divisor; thus L\u03c3 \u223c\n6 L.\n=\n\n\u0003\n\nIn fact, it is not hard to show that B(E, L, \u03c3) is generated as an algebra by B1 and B2 if deg L = 1, but we\nwill not need this result.\n9\n\n\fNext, we study subalgebras of B(E, L, \u03c3). The structure of these is strongly constrained by the results\nof Artin and Stafford on cfg domains of GK-dimension 2. Recall that (following [RRZ]) a cfg algebra A\nis called projectively simple if every nonzero homogeneous ideal I of A satisfies dimk A/I < \u221e. Using the\nArtin-Stafford theory, we now prove the following.\nLemma 3.2. Consider B = B(E, L, \u03c3) where deg L \u2265 1. Let A be a cfg subalgebra of B with dimk An \u2265 2\nfor some n \u2265 1.\n(1) GK A = 2, A is noetherian, and A is projectively simple.\n(2) Suppose that An 6= 0 for all n \u226b 0. Then there is another nonsingular elliptic curve F with\nautomorphism \u03c4 , such that A is equal in all large degrees to a ring of the form\nM\n\n(3.3)\n\nH0 (F, I \u2297 M \u2297 M\u03c4 \u2297 M\u03c4\n\n(n\u22121)\n\n),\n\nn\u22650\n\nwhere M is an invertible sheaf on F of positive degree and I is an ideal sheaf. Moreover, there is\na finite surjective morphism \u03b8 : E \u2192 F such that \u03c4 \u03b8 = \u03b8\u03c3, and \u03c4 is again translation by a point of\ninfinite order if we take basepoint \u03b8(p0 ) for the group structure of F .\n(3) Suppose that A is generated in degree 1. Let N be the sheaf generated on E by the sections in\nA1 \u2286 H 0 (E, L). Then I = OE in (3.3), and so A is equal in large degree to A\u2032 = B(F, M, \u03c4 ). We\nalso have degF M \u2265 2; N = \u03b8\u2217 M; and deg N = (deg \u03b8)(deg M). Finally, A \u2286 B(E, N , \u03c3) is a\nfinite ring extension.\nProof. (1) It is standard that since k is algebraically closed, a cfg domain A with GK A \u2264 1 is just a\nsubalgebra of k[t] where t has positive degree. (To see this, note that GK A \u2264 1 implies that dimk An is\nuniformly bounded, and so Qgr (A) \u223c\n= D[t, t\u22121 ; \u03c1] where D is a finite dimensional division algebra over k.)\nThe hypothesis on A thus implies that GK A = 2, using Bergman's gap theorem.\nNote that since A is a domain, S = {n|An 6= 0} must be a sub-semigroup of N, so it is easy to see that S\ncontains all large multiples of d = gcd(S). In particular, replacing A by its Veronese ring A(d) just amounts\nto a regrading, and the hypotheses are preserved (since B (d) \u223c\n= B(E, Ld , \u03c3 d )). Clearly the desired conclusions\nthat A is noetherian and projectively simple are unaffected by this change in grading. Thus we assume from\nnow on that An 6= 0 for all n \u226b 0, and we prove that A is noetherian and projectively simple in part (2).\n(2) Since A is a domain of finite GK-dimension, its graded quotient ring exists and has the form\nQgr (A) = L[t, t\u22121 ; \u03c3|L ] \u2286 Qgr (B) \u223c\n= k(E)[t, t\u22121 ; \u03c3],\nwhere we can take the same t of degree 1 in both quotient rings since An 6= 0 for all n \u226b 0. Here,\n\u03c3 : k(E) \u2192 k(E) is the automorphism on rational functions induced by \u03c3 : E \u2192 E, and necessarily L is a\n\u03c3-fixed subfield of k(E). Since GK A = 2, tr. deg L/k = 1 [AS, Theorem 0.1], and so L \u2286 k(E) is a finite\ndegree extension. Since \u03c3 : k(E) \u2192 k(E) has infinite order, \u03c3|L has infinite order.\n10\n\n\fNow the Artin-Stafford theory shows that A determines a projective curve F with k(F ) = L, and an\nautomorphism \u03c4 : F \u2192 F inducing \u03c3|L on rational functions [AS, Proposition 3.3]. Since E is nonsingular,\nthe inclusion of fields k(F ) \u2286 k(E) induces a surjective finite morphism of curves \u03b8 : E \u2192 F , such that\n\u03c4 \u03b8 = \u03b8\u03c3. If F has a singular locus S, then S is \u03c4 -invariant, and so \u03b8\u22121 (S) is a \u03c3-invariant set of points in\nE. Since \u03c3 is a translation by a point of infinite order, it has no nonempty \u03c3-invariant finite subsets, and\nso \u03b8\u22121 (S) and hence also S is empty. Thus F is also nonsingular. By Hurwitz's Theorem [Ha, Corollary\nIV.2.4], F has genus 1 or 0. If F has genus 0, then F \u223c\n= P1 and \u03c4 necessarily has a fixed point p. Then\n\u03b8\u22121 (p) is a finite non-empty \u03c3-invariant subset of E, again a contradiction. Thus F has genus 1, in other\nwords F is also a nonsingular elliptic curve. Recalling that p0 is the fixed basepoint for the group structure\non E, choosing the basepoint \u03b8(p0 ) for the group structure on F , then \u03b8 is a homomorphism of groups [Ha,\nLemma 4.9]. Since \u03c3 is the translation x 7\u2192 x + r, then \u03c4 : F \u2192 F is the translation y 7\u2192 y + \u03b8(r), where\nclearly \u03b8(r) is also a point of infinite order in the group of F .\nNow [AS, Proposition 6.4] shows that since \u03c4 has no fixed points, A must be isomorphic in large degree to\nthe ring in (3.3) for some invertible sheaf M of positive degree and some ideal sheaf I on F . It also follows\nthat A is noetherian [AS, Theorem 5.6], and projectively simple [AS, Theorem 5.11(2)].\n(3) Now assume that A is generated in degree 1, where N \u2286 L is the invertible sheaf generated on E by\nthe sections in A1 . Part (2) applies to A, and so A has the form given in (3.3) in large degree, necessarily with\nI = OF by [AS, Theorem 4.7]. In other words, A is isomorphic in large degree to the twisted homogeneous\ncoordinate ring A\u2032 = B(F, M, \u03c4 ). Obviously if dimk A1 = 1 then A \u223c\n= k[t], contradicting the hypothesis, so\ndimk A1 \u2265 2. Then deg M \u2265 2. Clearly also the sections in A1 \u2286 H0 (F, M) must generate M on F , or else\nA cannot equal B(F, M, \u03c4 ) in large degree. We must then have \u03b8\u2217 (M) = N , and deg N = (deg \u03b8)(deg M),\nwhere deg \u03b8 is the number of points in every fiber of \u03b8. To check that A = B(F, M, \u03c4 ) \u2286 B(E, N , \u03c3) is a finite\nextension of rings, we prove that A B is finitely generated and leave the similar verification that BA is finitely\ngenerated to the reader. It is enough, by the graded Nakayama lemma, to show that dimk B/A\u22651 B < \u221e. The\nL\nright ideal A\u22651 B of B is, by the equivalence of categories (2.1), equal in large degree to n\u22650 H0 (E, J \u2297 Nn )\nfor some ideal sheaf J on E. Since An already generates Nn on E for each n, necessarily J = OE . This\n\nshows that dimk B/A\u22651 B < \u221e, as required.\n\n\u0003\n\nConsider B(E, N , \u03c3) where deg N \u2265 1, so N is \u03c3-ample. Given a module N \u2208 gr-B with GK N \u2264 1, it\nwill be useful later to associate a Weil divisor to N which tracks the composition factors of the corresponding\ncoherent sheaf on E, in the following way.\nDefinition 3.4. For any N \u2208 gr-B(E, N , \u03c3) with GK N \u2264 1, then \u03c0(N ) \u2208 qgr-B corresponds under the\nP\nequivalence of categories (2.1) to a torsion sheaf F \u2208 coh E. Let C(N ) = p\u2208E [lengthOE,p Fp ] * p \u2208 Div E.\nWe want to make a few comments about point modules for B = B(E, N , \u03c3). We only want to discuss\npoint modules for rings which are generated in degree 1, so because of Lemma 3.1 we assume that deg N \u2265 2.\n11\n\n\fIn particular, in this case N is generated by its global sections [Ha, Corollary IV.3.2], and it easily follows\nL\nthat for each q \u2208 E, P = P (q) = n\u22650 H0 (E, k(q) \u2297 Nn ) is a point module for B, where here k(q) is the\n\nskyscraper sheaf at q.\n\nIn the last result of this section, we will study how the divisors defined in Definition 3.4 are related for\nmodules over two different twisted homogeneous coordinate rings. Let N \u2286 N \u2032 be invertible sheaves on E,\nwith 2 \u2264 deg N = deg N \u2032 \u2212 1. Thus N = Ip \u2297 N \u2032 for some unique point p \u2208 E, where Ip = OE (\u2212p) is the\nideal sheaf of the point p. Then we have B = B(E, N , \u03c3) \u2286 B \u2032 = B(E, N \u2032 , \u03c3). Given q \u2208 E, we have the\nL\ncorresponding B \u2032 -point module P (q)B \u2032 = n\u22650 H0 (E, k(q) \u2297 Nn\u2032 ) and the corresponding B-point module\nL\nQ(q)B = n\u22650 H0 (E, k(q) \u2297 Nn ).\nLemma 3.5. Keep the notation of the previous paragraph.\n(1) P (q)B \u2208 gr-B and \u03c0(P (q)B ) = \u03c0(Q(q)) in qgr-B.\n(2) For any N \u2208 gr-B \u2032 with GK N \u2264 1, then NB \u2208 gr-B and C(NB \u2032 ) = C(NB ) in Definition 3.4.\nProof. (1) Consider\nP = P (q)B \u2032 =\n\nM\n\nH0 (E, (OE /Iq ) \u2297 Nn\u2032 ).\n\nn\u22650\n\n= 0} = H0 (E, I\u03c4 n (q) \u2297 N \u2032 ), and so\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2H0 (E, I\u03c4 n (q) \u2297 N ) ( B1\n{x \u2208 B1 |Pn x = 0} = H0 (E, I\u03c4 n (q) \u2297 N \u2032 ) \u2229 B1 =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 B1\n\nGiven n \u2265 0, we calculate {x \u2208\n\nB1\u2032 |Pn x\n\nif p 6= \u03c4 n (q)\nif p = \u03c4 n (q)\n\nIn particular, Pn B1 = Pn+1 if and only if p 6= \u03c4 n (q). Since all orbits of \u03c4 are infinite, there is at most one\nn such that p = \u03c4 n (q). Thus for n large enough, say n \u2265 n0 , we see that (P\u2265n )B is a shifted point module\nfor B. In particular, PB is finitely generated. A similar calculation to the one above also easily shows for\nL\n0\n\u223c\nn \u2265 n0 that Q(q) =\nn\u22650 H (E, k(q) \u2297 Nn ) satisfies Q\u2265n = (P\u2265n )B , since r. annB Qn = r. annB Pn =\nL\n0\nm\u22650 H (E, I\u03c4 n (q) \u2297 Nm ). It follows that \u03c0(QB ) = \u03c0(PB ) in qgr-B.\n(2) Suppose that N is a 1-critical B \u2032 -module. Applying the category equivalence (2.1), clearly G(N ) is\n\na simple object of coh E and so is equal to a skyscraper sheaf k(q) for some q. Then N\u2265n \u223c\n= P (q)\u2265n for\nsome n. Now given any M \u2208 gr-B \u2032 with GK M = 1, using the fact that M has constant Hilbert function\nby Lemma 2.2(3), it is easy to prove that M has a filtration 0 = M0 \u2264 M1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 Mm = M , in which\nthe factors Mi /Mi\u22121 are either finite-dimensional or 1-critical (and so equal in large degree to tails of point\nmodules P (q)\u2265n .) Clearly C(N ) just enumerates the points q corresponding to the point module tails in\nthis filtration. Since the same interpretation holds for GK-1 modules over the ring B, both claims are now\nimmediate from part (1).\n\n\u0003\n4. The generic Sklyanin algebra\n\nIn this section, we review some basic properties of the Sklyanin algebra S. We then prove a combinatorial\nproposition, which will be the key to the calculation of the Hilbert series of the rings R(D) of main interest.\n12\n\n\fFor any a, b, c \u2208 k, the Sklyanin algebra S = S(a, b, c) is the k-algebra with presentation\nS(a, b, c) = khx, y, zi/{axy + byx + cz 2 , ayz + bzy + cx2 , azx + bxz + cy 2 }.\nThe algebra S is N-graded where x, y, z all have degree 1, and so S is generated as a k-algebra by S1 . It is\nwell-known that for very general choices of the parameters a, b, and c, S has the following properties: it is\nArtin-Schelter regular with Hilbert series hS (t) = 1/(1 \u2212 t)3 ; it has a unique up to scalar central element\ng \u2208 S3 ; S/Sg \u223c\n= B(E, L, \u03c3), where E is a nonsingular elliptic curve embedded as a degree 3 divisor in P2 and\nL = O(1)|E ; and \u03c3 : E \u2192 E has infinite order. See [ATV1, ATV2] for more details, including the definition\nof regular algebra. When S has all of the above properties, we say that S is a generic Sklyanin algebra. We\nindicate the image of any subset V of S under the quotient map S \u2192 S/Sg by V . Since \u03c3 has infinite order,\nfixing some base point p0 \u2208 E for the group law, then \u03c3 is a translation x 7\u2192 x + r, where r has infinite order\nin the group. For the rest of the paper, S stands for a generic Sklyanin algebra and the above notation is\nalso fixed.\nIt is known that every point module for S is annihilated by g, so the point modules for S are the same as the\npoint modules for S/Sg = B = B(E, L, \u03c3) [ATV2, Proposition 7.7ii]. As we saw in the previous section, given\nL\na point q \u2208 E we have a corresponding point module B/J for B, where J = J(q) = n\u22650 H0 (E, Iq \u2297Ln ). As\nan S-module, this is the point module S/I, where I = I(q) = {x \u2208 S|x \u2208 J(q)}. Since S has the same Hilbert\n\nseries as a commutative polynomial ring in three variables, we have dimk S1 = 3 and so dimk I(q)1 = 2; we\nset W (q) = I(q)1 and we call any such W (q) \u2286 S1 a point space. We prove next some very useful formulas\nabout products of point spaces and copies of S1 . Part (2) of the following lemma is also derived by Ajitabh\n[Aj1, Lemma 2.3, Proposition 2.14(iv)], but we give the proof since it follows easily from Lemma 3.1.\nLemma 4.1. Let p, q \u2208 E.\n(1) S1 W (\u03c3(q)) = W (q)S1 .\n(2) We have dimk W (p)W (q) = 4 if q 6= \u03c3 \u22122 (p). On the other hand, dimk W (p)W (\u03c3 \u22122 (p)) = 3.\nProof. (1) Since S 2 and S2 may be identified, we just note that in S, the product S 1 W (\u03c3(q)) amounts to\nthe image of the multiplication map\nH0 (E, L) \u2297 H0 (E, (I\u03c3(q) \u2297 L)\u03c3 ) \u2192 H0 (E, L2 ),\nwhich is H0 (E, Iq \u2297 L2 ) by Lemma 3.1(1). In other words, the image is the space of all sections of L2\nvanishing along the point q. The space W (q)S 1 is equal to the same thing by a similar calculation.\n(2) Again we identify S2 and S 2 , and we are looking for the image of the multiplication map\n\u03b8 : H0 (E, Ip \u2297 L) \u2297 H0 (E, (Iq \u2297 L)\u03c3 ) \u2192 H0 (E, L2 ).\nAs we saw in Lemma 3.1(1), im(\u03b8) has dimension 3 if Ip \u2297 L \u223c\n= I\u03c3\u22121 (q) \u2297 L\u03c3 ; otherwise, we have im(\u03b8) =\nH0 (E, Ip \u2297 I\u03c3\u22121 (q) \u2297 L2 ), and so dimk im(\u03b8) = 4. Letting L = OE (D) for some divisor D, we see that the\n13\n\n\fcase dimk im(\u03b8) = 3 occurs if and only if D \u2212 p \u223c \u03c3 \u22121 (D) \u2212 \u03c3 \u22121 (q). Since \u03c3 is a translation x \u2192 x + r, using\nAbel's theorem this condition is equivalent to p = q + 2r in the group law, or \u03c3 2 (q) = p.\n\n\u0003\n\nPart (2) of the preceding lemma is also related to the following explicit free resolution of a point module.\nLemma 4.2. Let W = W (q) \u2286 S1 be a point space with W = kw +kx. By Lemma 4.1(2), there are elements\ny, z \u2208 S1 such that wy + xz = 0, and with ky + kz = W (\u03c3 \u22122 (q)). Consider the complex\n0 1\nBy C\nB C\n@ A\n\n\u201e\n\n\u00ab\n\nw x\nz\n0 \u2192 S[\u22122] \u2212\u2192 S[\u22121] \u2295 S[\u22121] \u2212\u2192 S \u2192 S/(wS + xS) \u2192 0,\nwhere elements of the free modules are thought of as column vectors and the maps are left multiplication by\nthe indicated matrices. Then this is an exact sequence of right S-modules, W (q)S = wS + xS = I(q), and\nthis sequence is a free resolution of P (q) = S/I(q). In particular, wS \u2229 xS = wyS = xzS.\nProof. This is a special case of [ATV2, Proposition 6.7(ii)].\n\n\u0003\n\nUsing the lemmas above, we now prove an important combinatorial formula. In fact, it includes as a\nspecial case the calculation of the Hilbert function of the ring R(D) from the introduction,\nin case D = p is\n\u0012 \u0013\nn\na single point. As usual, we make the convention on binomial coefficients that\n= 0 if n < k.\nk\nProposition 4.3. Let W = W (p) \u2286 S1 be any point space. Then for all m \u2265 0 and n \u2265 0 we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn+1\nn\ndimk Sm (W S2 ) = dim Sm+3n \u2212\n.\n2\nProof. Let V (m, n) = Sm (W S2 )n , and put h(m, n) = dimk V (m, n) and j(m, n) = dimk Sm+3n \u2212\ngoal is to prove that h(m, n) = j(m, n) for all m, n \u2265 0. Note that since dimk Sm+3n =\nit is a triviality to check that j satisfies the following recurrence relations:\n(4.4)\n\nj(m, n) = j(m, n \u2212 1) + 3m + 8n,\n\n(4.5)\n\nj(m, n) = 2j(m + 2, n \u2212 1) \u2212 j(m + 4, n \u2212 2),\n\n\u0001\n\nm+3n+2\n2\n\n\u0001\n. Our\n\nn+1\n2\n\nis known,\n\nfor all m \u2265 0, n \u2265 2.\nNow we check the formula for small n. First, h(m, 0) = j(m, 0) is obvious for any m \u2265 0. Next, suppose\nthat n = 1; then V (m, 1) = Sm W (p)S2 = W (\u03c3 \u2212m (p))Sm+2 by Lemma 4.1(1). Since S/W (\u03c3 \u2212m (p))S is a\nright point module for S by Lemma 4.2, we must have h(m, 1) = dimk W (\u03c3 \u2212m (p))Sm+2 = dimk Sm+3 \u2212 1 =\nj(m, 1), as required.\nSince S/W S is a point module and g annihilates all point modules, we must have g \u2208 W S2 . Thus for\nn \u2265 1, the kernel of the quotient map V (m, n) \u2192 V (m, n) contains gV (m, n \u2212 1). In this case we have\ndimk V (m, n) = 3m + 8n, using Proposition 3.1 and the Riemann-Roch theorem. Thus we also get\nh(m, n) \u2265 h(m, n \u2212 1) + 3m + 8n,\n14\n\n\ffor any n \u2265 1. Using (4.4) and induction on n, it follows that h(m, n) \u2265 j(m, n) for all m, n \u2265 0.\nWe finish the proof by another induction on n. Let n \u2265 2 and suppose that h(m, k) = j(m, k) for all\nm \u2265 0 and k < n. We have\nV (m, n) = Sm (W (p)S2 )n = W (\u03c3 \u2212m (p))Sm+2 (W S2 )n\u22121 = wU + xU,\nwhere W (\u03c3 \u2212m (p)) = kw + kx and U = V (m + 2, n \u2212 1). By Lemma 4.2, we have wy + xz = 0, where\nky + kz = W (\u03c3 \u2212m\u22122 (p)), and in fact wS \u2229 xS = wyS = xzS. Then\nwU \u2229 xU = {wys|s \u2208 S, ys \u2208 U, zs \u2208 U } = {wys|s \u2208 S, W (\u03c3 \u2212m\u22122 (p))s \u2286 U } \u2287 wyV (m + 4, n \u2212 2),\nwhere the last inclusion holds since by Lemma 4.1(1),\nW (\u03c3 \u2212m\u22122 (p))Sm+4 (W S2 )n\u22122 = Sm+2 W S2 (W S2 )n\u22122 = V (m + 2, n \u2212 1) = U.\nThus we have\nh(m, n) = dimk (wU + xU ) = 2 dimk U \u2212 dimk (wU \u2229 xU ) \u2264 2h(m + 2, n \u2212 1) \u2212 h(m + 4, n \u2212 2)\n= 2j(m + 2, n \u2212 1) \u2212 j(m + 4, n \u2212 2) = j(m, n),\nusing the induction hypothesis and (4.5). Since we have already proved that h(m, n) \u2265 j(m, n), the result\nfollows.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe last result of this section contains some other formulas about products of point spaces, which we give\nhere because the proofs are also easy consequences of Lemma 4.2. However, we remark that these formulas\nare used only much later, in Sections 11 and 12, and are needed not in the proofs of the main theorems of\nthe paper.\nLemma 4.6.\n\n(1) dimk W (p)W (q)S1 = 8 if q 6= \u03c3 \u22122 (p), while dimk W (p)W (\u03c3 2 (p))S1 = 7. In particular,\n\ng \u2208 W (p)W (q)S1 if and only if q 6= \u03c3 \u22122 (p).\n(2) g \u2208 W (p)3 for any point p.\n(3) Let 0 6= f \u2208 S1 . Then g \u2208 S1 f S1 .\nProof. All three parts are proved the same way. Given X \u2286 S2 , consider W (p)X for some point space\nW (p) = kw + kx. Then W (p)X = wX + xX and so dimk W (p)X = 2 dimk X \u2212 dimk wX \u2229 xX. But if y\nand z are the basis of W (\u03c3 \u22122 (p)) such that wy + xz = 0, as in Lemma 4.2, then\nwX \u2229 xX = {wyr|yr, zr \u2208 X} = wy{r|W (\u03c3 \u22122 (p))r \u2208 X}.\nThus dimk wX \u2229 xX = dimk Y , where Y = {r \u2208 S1 |W (\u03c3 \u22122 (p))r \u2208 X}. In the following, since S equals S\nin degree up to 2, we identify these low degree elements of the two rings. We also use Lemma 3.1(1) many\ntimes below without further comment, to calculate the dimension of products in S.\n15\n\n\f(1) Take X = W (q)S1 above. Then dimk X = 5. If q = \u03c3 \u22122 (p), then Y = S1 , and so dimk W (p)X =\n10 \u2212 3 = 7. If instead q 6= \u03c3 \u22122 (p), then Y = W (\u03c3(q)), and so dimk W (p)X = 10 \u2212 2 = 8. In any case we\nhave dimk W (p)W (q)S1 = 7. So g \u2208 W (p)W (q)S1 if and only if q 6= \u03c3 \u22122 (p).\n(2) Take X = W (p)2 above. Then dimk X = 4 and dimk W (p)3 = 6. For a section in S1 = H0 (E, L) to be\nin Y , it must vanish at both p and \u03c3 \u22121 (p), so dimk Y = 1. Thus dimk W (p)3 = 8 \u2212 1 = 7, and so g \u2208 W (p)3 .\n(3). We have that f \u2208 H0 (E, L) vanishes along some divisor D. Letting p be any point such that D does\nnot contain \u03c3 \u22122 (p), then we claim that we even have g \u2208 W (p)f S1 . We let X = f S1 above, so dimk X = 3.\nSuppose that 0 6= y \u2208 Y , so that W (\u03c3 \u22122 (p))y \u2286 f S1 \u2286 H0 (E, L2 ). Since \u03c3 \u22122 (p) is not a point of D, y must\nvanish along all of \u03c3(D); but since y \u2208 H0 (E, L), this implies that \u03c3(D) \u223c D, a contradiction. So Y = 0\nand dimk W (p)f S1 = 6. Since dimk W (p)f S1 = 5, g \u2208 W (p)f S1 .\n\n\u0003\n\n5. The rings R(D) and their first properties\nWe maintain the notation from the previous section, so that S is a generic Sklyanin algebra, and X\nL\nindicates the image of a subset X \u2286 S under the map S \u2192 S/Sg. Now let T = S (3) = n\u22650 S3n be the\n\n2\n3-Veronese of S. Then g \u2208 T1 and T = T /T g \u223c\n= B(E, M, \u03c4 ), where M = L3 = L \u2297 L\u03c3 \u2297 L\u03c3 has degree\n\n9 on E and \u03c4 = \u03c3 3 . We recall the definition of the ring R(D), which was given in the introduction. Let\nD be an effective divisor on E with 0 \u2264 e = deg D \u2264 7. Let N = ID \u2297 M, where ID = OE (\u2212D). We\ndefine V = V (D) = {x \u2208 T1 |x \u2208 H0 (E, N )}. Note that V = H0 (E, N ) satisfies dimk V = 9 \u2212 e by the\nRiemann-Roch theorem, and so dimk V = 10 \u2212 e. Let R = R(D) = khV i be the k-subalgebra of T generated\nby V . The notation of this paragraph is used throughout the rest of the paper, except in Sections 6-8, where\nwe study a slightly more general class of rings.\nThe first step in our analysis of R(D) is to identify the ring R = R/R \u2229 T g \u2286 T . Since R is generated\nin degree 1, R is the subalgebra of B(E, M, \u03c4 ) generated in degree 1 by H0 (E, N ). By Lemma 3.1(2), since\ndeg N \u2265 2, R is simply the subring B(E, N , \u03c4 ) of T . In particular, using Riemann-Roch, the Hilbert series\nof R is\n(5.1)\n\nhR (t) = 1 +\n\nX\n\n(9 \u2212 e)ntn =\n\nn\u22651\n\nt2 + (7 \u2212 e)t + 1\n.\n(1 \u2212 t)2\n\nUsing the help of Proposition 4.3 from the last section, we now calculate the Hilbert series of R.\nTheorem 5.2. Fix an effective divisor D on E with 0 \u2264 e = deg D \u2264 7, and let R = R(D). Then\nt2 + (7 \u2212 e)t + 1\n.\n(1) hR (t) =\n(1 \u2212 t)3\n(2) R \u2229 T g = Rg.\nProof. In fact, the statements in parts (1) and (2) of the theorem are equivalent. Since R \u2229 T g \u2287 Rg in any\ncase and R is a domain, we definitely have hR (t) \u2264 (1 \u2212 t) hR (t). Part (2) holds if and only if this is an\nequality of Hilbert series, which is if and only if (1) holds, by (5.1). We thus prove both parts of the theorem\nin tandem.\n16\n\n\fWe first extend k to an uncountable algebraically closed field if necessary. Since the Hilbert series of R\nremains unchanged, this loses no generality.\nIf deg D = 0 there is nothing to prove, since (2) is a tautology in this case. Now let deg D = 1, say\nD = p. Since S/W (p)S has the Hilbert series of a point module, by Lemma 4.2, it is easy to see that\nR1 = W (p)S2 \u2286 T1 . Applying Proposition 4.3 with m = 0, we have\nhR (t) =\n\nt2 + 7t + 1\nt\nt2 + 6t + 1\n\u2212\n=\n,\n3\n3\n(1 \u2212 t)\n(1 \u2212 t)\n(1 \u2212 t)3\n\nand so (1) (and hence also (2)) holds in this case.\nNext, suppose that the theorem holds for R\u2032 = R(D\u2032 ), for some effective divisor D\u2032 with 0 \u2264 deg D\u2032 < 7,\nand let D = D\u2032 + p. We now prove that the theorem holds for R = R(D), assuming the further restriction\nthat p does not lie on the \u03c4 -orbit of any point occurring in D\u2032 . Let R# = R\u2032 \u2229 R(p). Obviously R# \u2287 R;\nwe will show that in fact we have equality. First we find R# . We know that R\u2032 = B(E, ID\u2032 \u2297 M, \u03c4 ) and\nR(p) = B(E, Ip \u2297 M, \u03c4 ). Thus in degree n \u2265 1, we have\nR(p)n = H0 (E, IC \u2297 Mn ),\nwhere C =\n\nPn\u22121\n\nwhere C \u2032 =\n\nj=0\n\n\u03c4 \u2212j (p), and similarly,\nR\u2032 n = H0 (E, IC \u2032 \u2297 Mn ),\n\nPn\u22121\nj=0\n\n\u03c4 \u2212j (D\u2032 ). But the assumption on p implies that the divisors C and C \u2032 have disjoint\n\nsupport, so it follows that we have\nR(p)n \u2229 R\u2032 n = H0 (E, IC+C \u2032 \u2297 Mn ) = Rn ,\nsince C + C \u2032 =\n\nPn\u22121\nj=0\n\n\u03c4 \u2212j (D). But then we see that we have R# \u2286 R(p) \u2229 R\u2032 = R \u2286 R# , and thus R = R# .\n\nNow note that since R(p) \u2229 T g = R(p)g and R\u2032 \u2229 T g = R\u2032 g, we have\nR# \u2229 T g = R(p) \u2229 R\u2032 \u2229 T g \u2286 R(p)g \u2229 R\u2032 g = (R(p) \u2229 R\u2032 )g = R# g \u2286 R# \u2229 T g.\nThus all inclusions here are actually equalities, and R# \u2229 T g = R# g. Since R \u2229 T g \u2287 Rg and R = R# , it\nfollows that hR (t) \u2265 hR (t)/(1 \u2212 t) = hR# (t)/(1 \u2212 t) = hR# (t); since R \u2286 R# , this forces R = R# . Then\nR \u2229 T g = Rg, so (2) holds for R = R(D).\nFinally, assume again that the theorem holds for some D\u2032 , where 0 \u2264 deg D\u2032 < 7, and consider D = D\u2032 + p\nwhere p \u2208 E now varies. We show that R(D) has the correct Hilbert series for all p; the theorem will then\nfollow by induction on deg D. We have a regular map \u03c6 : E \u2192 P(H0 (E, ID\u2032 \u2297 M)\u2217 ), namely the map to\nprojective space determined by a basis of sections for the sheaf ID\u2032 \u2297 M on E, which can be described\nexplicitly as p 7\u2192 H0 (E, ID\u2032 +p \u2297 M) = V (D). Thus the map \u03c6 : E \u2192 P(V (D\u2032 )\u2217 ) given by p 7\u2192 V (D) is also\nregular. Fixing some n \u2265 1, we define a function f : P(V (D\u2032 )\u2217 ) \u2192 N by the rule Y 7\u2192 dimk Y n , where Y is\na codimension-1 subspace of V (D\u2032 ) and Y n \u2286 Tn is the product inside T . A standard argument now gives\nthat f is lower semi-continuous; in other words, {Y \u2208 P(V (D\u2032 )\u2217 )| dimk Y n \u2264 m} is Zariski closed for each\n17\n\n\fm \u2208 N. Thus f \u25e6 \u03c6 : E \u2192 N, where f \u25e6 \u03c6(p) = dimk V (D)n = dimk R(D)n , is also lower semi-continuous. We\nshowed in the previous paragraph that R(D) has the correct Hilbert series for all points p \u2208 E outside of a\nunion of finitely many \u03c4 -orbits; on the other hand, E has uncountably many points since k is uncountable.\nt2 + (7 \u2212 e)t + 1\nfor all\nIt thus follows, from the lower-semicontinuity of f \u25e6 \u03c6 for each n, that hR(D) (t) \u2264\n(1 \u2212 t)2\np \u2208 E, where e = deg D. The reverse inequality was essentially shown in the first paragraph of the proof, so\nwe are done.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor later use, we need the additional Hilbert series calculation given in the next lemma. The proof uses\nexactly the same technique as the proof of the previous result.\nLemma 5.3. Let D\u2032 be an effective divisor with 0 \u2264 deg D\u2032 \u2264 6, let p \u2208 E and let D = D\u2032 + p. Let\ne = deg D = deg D\u2032 + 1. Let R = R(D) and R\u2032 = R(D\u2032 ). Consider the right R-module M = k + R1\u2032 R. Then\nhM (t) = hR (t) +\n\nt\n(8 \u2212 e)t + 1\n=\n.\n(1 \u2212 t)2\n(1 \u2212 t)3\n\nProof. An easy calculation, using Lemma 3.1(1), shows that M/(T g \u2229 M ) = M = k + R1\u2032 R has Hilbert series\n(8 \u2212 e)t + 1\n. Since multiplication by g is an injective homomorphism of M , we have\n(1 \u2212 t)2\nhM (t) =\n\nhM/Mg (t)\nh (t)\n(8 \u2212 e)t + 1\n.\n\u2265 M\n=\n(1 \u2212 t)\n(1 \u2212 t)\n(1 \u2212 t)3\n\nNow suppose that p does not lie on the \u03c4 -orbit of any point in the support of D\u2032 . Then we showed in\nthe course of the proof of Theorem 5.2 that R\u2032 \u2229 R(p) = R. Since all Hilbert series of the terms in this\nequation are now known by Theorem 5.2, it easily follows that R\u2032 + R(p) = T . This certainly implies that\nR\u2032 + (k + T1 R(p)) = T . But the Hilbert series of k + T1 R(p) follows from Proposition 4.3, so this determines\n(8 \u2212 e)t + 1\nimmediately the Hilbert series of N = R\u2032 \u2229(k+T1 R(p)), which a calculation shows to be hN (t) =\n.\n(1 \u2212 t)3\nSince M \u2286 N , the estimate of the first paragraph forces M = N , and thus the Hilbert series of M is as\nstated.\nNow just as in the proof of the previous theorem, we can reduce to the case where k is uncountable.\nA completely analogous argument as that of the last paragraph of the previous proof also shows that for\nany n \u2265 1, the k-dimension of Mn = R1\u2032 Rn\u22121 is a lower semi-continuous function of p \u2208 E. The estimate\n(8 \u2212 e)t + 1\nhM (t) \u2265\nholds for all p, and was shown above to be an equality for all but countably many p;\n(1 \u2212 t)3\n(8 \u2212 e)t + 1\nthis forces hM (t) =\nfor all p, as required.\n\u0003\n(1 \u2212 t)3\nWe close this section with a few more properties of R(D) that follow easily at this point. Together with\nTheorem 5.2, the following result finishes the proof of Theorem 1.1(1).\nTheorem 5.4. Let R = R(D) for some effective divisor D with 0 \u2264 deg D \u2264 7.\n(1) R has infinite global dimension.\n(2) Qgr (R) = Qgr (T ).\n18\n\n\fe for some divisor D\ne with deg D\ne = deg D.\n(3) Rop \u223c\n= R(D)\n\nProof. (1) A standard argument (for example, see [ATV2, Proposition 2.9]), using the minimal graded free\n1\nresolution of kR = R/R\u22651 , shows that if R has finite global dimension, then hR (t) =\nfor some polynomial\np(t)\np(t) \u2208 Z[t]. But it is easy to prove that the Hilbert series of R, as calculated in Theorem 5.2, cannot be\nwritten in this form.\n(2) If D = 0 there is nothing to prove, so assume deg D > 0 and write D = D\u2032 + p for some divisor D\u2032 . We\nwill show that Qgr (R) = Qgr (R\u2032 ), where R = R(D) and R\u2032 = R(D\u2032 ). Then the result follows by induction\non deg D. By Lemma 5.3, dimk R1\u2032 R1 \u2212 dimk R2 = 2. We may write R1\u2032 = R1 + kz for some element z \u2208 R1\u2032 ,\nand so R1\u2032 R1 = zR1 + R2 . Since dimk R1 \u2265 3 (given that deg D \u2264 7), we must have zR1 \u2229 R2 6= 0. Then\nz \u2208 Qgr (R), so R\u2032 \u2286 Qgr (R) and thus Qgr (R) = Qgr (R\u2032 ).\n(3) Consider the ring B = B(E, M, \u03c4 ) and the set of all possible subspaces of the form H0 (E, ID \u2297M) \u2286 B1\nfor divisors with 0 \u2264 deg D \u2264 7. We claim that this set can also be characterized as the set of all subspaces\nW \u2286 B1 such that the ring khW i satisfies Qgr (khW i) = Qgr (B) and dimk W n = n(dimk W ) for all n \u2265 1.\nIn fact, the claim follows easily from Lemma 3.2(3). As a consequence, it is easy to see that any graded\nanti-automorphism \u03c6 : B \u2192 B must permute this set of subspaces.\nNow, it is well known that S op \u223c\n= S; for example, the map induced by x 7\u2192 y, y 7\u2192 x, z 7\u2192 z gives an antiautomorphism \u03c6 : S \u2192 S, as one easily sees from the presentation. Passing to the 3-Veroneses, this induces\nan anti-automorphism \u03c6 : T \u2192 T . Since the central element g is unique up to scalar, \u03c6 must descend to\nan anti-automorphism \u03c8 : T /T g \u2192 T /T g, where T /T g \u223c\n= B = B(E, M, \u03c4 ). By the first paragraph, \u03c8 must\npermute the set of subspaces of the form H0 (E, ID \u2297 M) \u2286 B1 . Thus \u03c6 : T \u2192 T permutes the subspaces\nof the form V (D) \u2286 T1 for divisors 0 \u2264 deg D \u2264 7. So for given D, \u03c6 restricts to an anti-isomorphism from\ne for some other divisor D,\ne which clearly must have the same degree.\nR(D) to R(D)\n\n\u0003\n\n6. Rings with a twisted homogenous coordinate ring factor\n\nIn this section, we prove that the rings R(D) have many additional nice properties; in particular, we prove\nTheorem 1.1(2). Since we now know that R(D)/R(D)g \u223c\n= B(E, N , \u03c4 ), the main technique is to observe that\nmany good properties pass from the factor ring B to the ring R(D). This technique is well-known and holds\nmuch more generally. Because it may be useful for future reference, and is not really any more difficult, in\nthis section and the next two we work not just with the rings R(D), but with the more general class of rings\nsatisfying the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis 6.1. Let R be a cfg k-algebra which is generated in degree 1. Suppose that R is a domain with\na homogeneous central element g of degree d > 0 such that R/Rg \u223c\n= B(E, N , \u03c4 ), where E is a nonsingular\nelliptic curve with fixed basepoint p0 , \u03c4 : E \u2192 E is a translation automorphism x 7\u2192 x + s for a point s of\ninfinite order, and deg N \u2265 2. We continue to use the notation Y for the image of a subset Y of R under\nthe map R \u2192 R/Rg.\n19\n\n\fHypothesis 6.1 is assumed throughout the rest of this section. We remark that for some of the results of this\nand the next few sections, it is sufficient that g be a normal element (Rg = gR); in particular, this is true\nof Theorems 6.3 and 6.7 below.\nThe following definition is standard in this setting.\nDefinition 6.2. Given any cfg algebra A with a central element g and M \u2208 gr-A, we define its g-torsion\nsubmodule Z(M ) = {m \u2208 M |mg n = 0 for some n > 0}. M is g-torsion if Z(M ) = M and g-torsionfree if\nZ(M ) = 0.\nThis torsion theory has the usual formal properties. For example, it is easy to verify that as long as A is\nnoetherian, then for any M \u2208 gr-A, Z(M )g n = 0 for some n \u2265 1, and M/Z(M ) is g-torsionfree.\nIn the next theorem, we give a number of properties of rings satisfying Hypothesis 6.1 which follow quite\nimmediately from the properties of twisted homogeneous coordinate rings studied earlier, together with\nresults from the literature about when good properties \"pass up\" from a factor ring modulo a central (or\nnormal) element.\nTheorem 6.3. Let R satisfy Hypothesis 6.1.\n(1) R is strongly noetherian.\n(2) Every M \u2208 gr-R has a Hilbert quasi-polynomial of period d.\n(3) R is Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay.\n(4) R satisfies \u03c7 on the left and right, and proj R has cohomological dimension 2.\nProof. (1) Since B(E, N , \u03c4 ) is strongly noetherian by Lemma 2.2(1), R is strongly noetherian by [ASZ,\nProposition 4.9(1)].\n(2) For any module M \u2208 gr-R, consider its g-torsion submodule Z(M ). Since Z(M )g n = 0 for some\nn, Z(M ) has a filtration with finitely many factor modules Z(M )g i /Z(M )g i+1 , each of which is a graded\nB-module; thus Z(M ) has a Hilbert polynomial, by Lemma 2.2(3). Since M \u2032 = M/Z(M ) is g-torsionfree,\nH(M \u2032 /M \u2032 g) (t)\n. Here, M \u2032 /M \u2032 g again is a B-module and so has a Hilbert polynomial. The form of\nHM \u2032 (t) =\n(1 \u2212 td )\nthe Hilbert series of M \u2032 then implies that M \u2032 has a Hilbert quasi-polynomial of period d. Thus M does also.\n(3) The ring B(E, N , \u03c4 ) is Auslander-Gorenstein of dimension 2 and Cohen-Macualay, by Lemma 2.2(4).\nThen R is Auslander-Gorenstein of dimension 3 and Cohen-Macaulay, by [Lev, Theorem 5.10].\n(4) We know that B satisfies \u03c7 and cd(proj- B) = 1, by Lemma 2.2(2), so R satisfies \u03c7 by [AZ1, Theorem\n8.8], and cd(proj- R) \u2264 2 by [AZ1, Theorem 8.8]. We need to show equality in the last statement. The\nhigher cohomology in proj- R can be calculated as a limit of Ext groups:\nM\nH i (\u03c0(M )[m]) = lim Exti+1\nR (R/R\u2265n , M ),\nm\u2208Z\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nfor any i \u2265 1 and M \u2208 gr-R [AZ1, Proposition 7.2]. Here, the direct limit is induced by the obvious factor\nmaps R/R\u2265(n+1) \u2192 R/R\u2265n . Now since R is Cohen-Macaulay by part (3), for any N with GK N = 0 we\n20\n\n\fhave ExtiR (N, R) = 0 if i < 3, but Ext3R (N, R) 6= 0. It follows from the long exact sequence in Ext that\nL\nthe maps in the direct limit limn\u2192\u221e Ext3 (R/R\u2265n , R) are injective, and thus m\u2208Z H 2 (\u03c0(R)[m]) 6= 0. So\n\ncd(proj- R) = 2 exactly.\n\n\u0003\n\nNext, we study homogeneous ideals of rings R satisfying Hypothesis 6.1. Here are a few basic properties\nof such ideals.\nLemma 6.4. Let R satisfy Hypothesis 6.1.\n(1) If J \u2286 R is a nonzero homogeneous ideal, then J = Ig n for some n \u2265 0 and some ideal I with\nGK R/I \u2264 1.\n(2) If I is a homogeneous ideal of R with GK R/I \u2264 1, then there is a unique homogeneous ideal I \u2032 \u2287 I\nsuch that dimk I \u2032 /I < \u221e and R/I \u2032 is g-torsionfree.\n(3) If M \u2208 gr-R is g-torsionfree with GK M \u2264 1, then I = r. annR (M ) is an ideal such that GK R/I = 1\nand R/I is g-torsionfree.\nProof. (1) Since J 6= 0, there is a maximal n \u2265 0 such that J \u2286 Rg n . Then J = Ig n for some homogeneous\nideal I. Since I * Rg by choice of n, I 6= 0 in R/Rg = B(E, N , \u03c4 ), which is a projectively simple ring by\ne Rg\ne < \u221e, from which it follows that GK R\ne \u2264 1.\ne = R/I satisfies dimk R/\nLemma 3.2(1). Thus R\n\n(2) Let I be such an ideal. Since GK R/Rg = 2, I * Rg and so the same argument as in part (1) shows\n\nthat dimk R/(I + Rg) < \u221e. But then since (I + Rg i )/(I + Rg i+1 ) is a finitely generated R/(I + Rg)-module\nfor each i, dimk R/(I + Rg n ) < \u221e for each n. Write I \u2032 /I = Z((R/I)R ); clearly I \u2032 is a homogeneous ideal.\nThen I \u2032 /I is annihilated by some g n , and thus is a finitely generated R/(I +Rg n )-module. So dimk I \u2032 /I < \u221e,\nas claimed.\n(3) Since M has a Hilbert quasi-polynomial of period d, by Theorem 6.3(2), GK M \u2264 1 implies that M\nhas eventually periodic Hilbert function of period d. In particular, since M is g-torsionfree, M g is equal in\nlarge degree to M , so there is n1 such that (M g)\u2265n1 = M\u2265n1 . Now since g is central, we conclude that\nMn = (Mn\u2212d )g and Mn\u2212d have the same right annihilator in R, for all n \u2265 n1 . Thus I = r. annR M =\nLn1 \u22121\nL 1 \u22121\nMn is a finiteMn ), where n0 is an integer such that Mn = 0 for n < n0 . But since n=n\nr. annR ( nn=n\n0\n0\n\ndimensional subspace of the module M of GK-dimension \u2264 1, this forces GK R/I \u2264 1 as needed. It is easy\nto check that R/(r. annR M ) is automatically g-torsionfree, because M is.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe see from part (1) of the preceding result that we will understand all of the ideals of R if we understand\nthe ideals I such that GK R/I = 1. It is convenient to make the following definitions.\nDefinition 6.5. Let A be a cfg k-algebra. If I is a homogeneous ideal of A such that GK A/I \u2264 1, then\nwe call I special and we call A/I a special factor ring. A special ideal I of A is said to be minimal in tails\nif \u03c0(I) is (uniquely) minimal among the set of objects {\u03c0(J) \u2208 qgr-A|J is a special ideal of A}. In other\nwords, this means that every other special ideal J of A satisfies J \u2287 I\u2265n for some n \u2265 0. If A has a special\nideal which is minimal in tails, then (speaking loosely) we say that A has a minimal special ideal.\n21\n\n\fThe reason for the terminology \"special\" is that the rings S and T have no special factor rings except those\nof finite k-dimension, as we recall in Lemma 10.3 below. The rings R(D) sometimes do have GK-1 factor\nrings (see Example 11.1), but they are rather rare, exactly in the sense that R(D) always has a minimal\nspecial ideal. Proving this is the goal of much of the next several sections.\nRemark 6.6. Suppose that R satisfies Hypothesis 6.1, and that R has a minimal special ideal. Using the\nresults of Lemma 6.4 we can say more about this situation. Since clearly any two ideals which are both\nminimal in tails agree in large degree, using Lemma 6.4(2) there is a unique ideal I which is minimal in tails\nwith the additional property that R/I is g-torsionfree. In other words, R has a unique largest homogeneous\ng-torsionfree special factor ring R/I. Also, by Lemma 6.4(3), it is then easy to see that this same ideal\nI is also the unique largest ideal which annihilates all GK-1 g-torsionfree right R-modules. Because of\nTheorem 5.4(3), I must also be the unique largest ideal annihilating all GK-1 g-torsionfree left R-modules.\nWe now show that rings satisfying the main hypothesis of this section are maximal orders, as a quick\nconsequence of the Cohen-Macaulay property. That the maximal order property is closely connected to such\nhomological properties more generally is well-known; for example, see [St]. Together with Theorem 6.3, this\ncompletes the proof of Theorem 1.1(2).\nTheorem 6.7.\nLet R satisfy Hypothesis 6.1. Then R is a maximal order in its Goldie quotient ring.\nProof. For a homogeneous ideal J of R, we define Or (J) = HomR (R J,R J) = {x \u2208 Qgr (R)|Jx \u2286 J} and\nOl (J) = HomR (JR , JR ) = {x \u2208 Qgr (R)|xJ \u2286 J}. To show that R is a maximal order, it suffices to show\nthat for all homogeneous ideals J of R, we have Or (J) = Ol (J) = R [Ro, Lemma 9.1]. We prove that\nOl (J) = R; the proof that Or (J) = R is symmetric, and is left to the reader.\nAny homogeneous ideal J of R has the form J = J \u2032 g n where J \u2032 is a special ideal, by Lemma 6.4(1). Then\nOl (J) = {x \u2208 Qgr (R)|xJ \u2032 g n \u2286 J \u2032 g n } = {x \u2208 Qgr (R)|xJ \u2032 \u2286 J \u2032 } = Ol (J \u2032 ).\nSo it will be enough to consider special homogeneous ideals J, and show that HomR (JR , JR ) = R. Since\nHomR (JR , JR ) \u2286 HomR (JR , RR ), it is enough to show that HomR (JR , RR ) = R. But we have the following\nportion of the long exact sequence in Ext:\n. . . \u2212\u2192 R = HomR (RR , RR ) \u2212\u2192 HomR (JR , RR ) \u2212\u2192 Ext1R (R/J, R) \u2212\u2192 . . .\nSince GK(R/J) \u2264 1, we have Ext1R (R/J, R) = 0 by the Cohen-Macaulay property of R, which holds by\nTheorem 6.3(3). Thus HomR (JR , RR ) = R and the result follows.\n\n\u0003\n\n7. Subrings\nIn order to prove our main classification result, Theorem 1.2, we need to get some understanding of when\na cfg subring A of a ring R(D) is an equivalent order to R(D). Thus, in this section we study when this\n22\n\n\fhappens for subrings A which are close to R(D), in the sense that A \u2286 R(D) is a finite ring extension. This\nis a natural assumption, because it is what we will actually know when we apply these results later in the\nproof of Theorem 1.2.\nAs in the previous section, we actually work with a slightly more general setup. For the rest of this\nsection, we fix the following notation.\nHypothesis 7.1. Let R be a ring satisfying Hypothesis 6.1, and let A \u2286 R be a cfg subalgebra such that\nQgr (A) = Qgr (R) and A \u2286 R is a finite ring extension. Let C = Ahgi be the subring generated by A and\nthe central element g \u2208 Rd , so that A \u2286 C \u2286 R.\nWe first make a convenient definition concerning ring extensions. Let U \u2286 V be an inclusion of cfg\nk-algebras which are domains with Qgr (U ) = Qgr (V ). We say that U and V have a common ideal if there\nis a homogeneous ideal 0 6= I of V such I \u2286 U . Clearly if U and V have a common ideal, then they are\nequivalent orders. Here are some other simple facts about this concept.\nLemma 7.2. Let U \u2286 V \u2286 W be cfg k-algebras which are domains with Qgr (U ) = Qgr (V ) = Qgr (W ).\n(1) If U \u2286 V is a finite ring extension, then U and V have a common ideal.\n(2) If U and V have a common ideal and V and W have a common ideal, then U and W also have a\ncommon ideal.\nProof. (1) This argument may be found in the proof of [AS, Theorem 4.1], but we repeat it here for convenience. Since U and V have the same graded quotient ring, every element of (V /U )U has nonzero annihilator in U . Moreover,\n\nU (V /U )U\n\nis a bimodule which is finitely generated on both sides. It follows that\n\nI = r. annU (V /U ) is a nonzero homogeneous right ideal of U which also satisfies V I \u2286 I. A symmetric\nargument gives that J = l. annU (V /U ) is a nonzero homogeneous left ideal of U such that JV \u2286 J. Thus\n0 6= IJ is a homogeneous ideal of V which is contained in U .\n(2) Let 0 6= I be a common ideal for U and V and 0 6= J a common ideal for V and W . Then 0 6= JIJ is\na common ideal for U and W .\n\n\u0003\n\nAs mentioned earlier, one of our main concerns is to understand when the ring A in Hypothesis 7.1 is\nan equivalent order to R. We will prove this below only under a further assumption that R has a minimal\nspecial ideal. The case where g \u2208 A, in other words the case of the ring C, is much more straightforward,\nand so we study it separately first.\nLemma 7.3. Assume Hypothesis 7.1.\n(1) C \u2286 R is a finite extension and C is a noetherian ring.\n(2) Every special factor ring of C has eventually periodic Hilbert function of period d. Also, if R has a\nminimal special ideal, then so does C.\n23\n\n\fProof. (1) The graded Nakayama lemma shows that RC is a finitely generated module if and only if\ndimk R/RC\u22651 < \u221e. Since g \u2208 C\u22651 , this is also equivalent, by Nakayama again, to R = R/Rg being a\nfinitely generated right C-module, which is true by hypothesis. A similar argument holds on the left, so\nC \u2286 R is a finite extension.\nIt remains to prove that C is noetherian. We claim that in fact the following fact holds: given a finitely\ngenerated Z-graded right C-module M , if (M/M g)C is noetherian then MC is noetherian. First note that\nsince M is finitely generated, M is right bounded (Mn = 0 for n \u226a 0). Using this, it is easy to prove that if\nM has a non-finitely generated submodule, it has a homogeneous non-finitely generated submodule. Since\ng is obviously still a central (and hence normal) element of C, the rest of the proof of the claim follows by\nexactly the same argument as [ATV1, Lemma 8.2], which proves the case where M = C.\nApply the claim to M = R; this shows that RC is noetherian as long as (R/Rg)C is noetherian. In fact,\nR = R/Rg is a C = C/(C \u2229 Rg) module, and so it is enough to prove that RC is noetherian. This follows\nsince C \u2286 R is a finite ring extension, and C is noetherian by Lemma 3.2(1). Thus RC is noetherian, and a\nsymmetric argument shows that\n\nCR\n\nis noetherian. Of course, then, C is a noetherian ring.\n\n(2) Suppose that I is an arbitrary special ideal of C. Since C \u2286 R is a finite extension by part (1),\nLemma 7.2(1) implies that C and R have a common nonzero homogeneous ideal, say 0 6= H. We can assume\nthat H \u2286 I, by replacing H by HIH if necessary. By Lemma 6.4(1), H = Kg n for some special ideal K of\nR and n \u2265 0. By Lemma 6.4(2), K has a finite dimensional extension L such that R/L is g-torsionfree; by\nincreasing n if necessary, we can take H = Lg n as our common ideal.\nNow given any i \u2265 1, notice that the right C-module M = ((C \u2229 Lg i\u22121 ) + I)/((C \u2229 Lg i ) + I) is killed\nby (C \u2229 Rg) + I, so M is a module over C/((C \u2229 Rg) + I) = C/I. The ring C is projectively simple, by\nLemma 3.2(1). Also, I 6= 0 since GK C/I = 1, so necessarily dimk C/I < \u221e. We know that C is noetherian\nby part (1), so M \u2208 gr-C and thus dimk M < \u221e. Since (C \u2229 Lg n ) + I = I, we conclude by induction on i\nthat dimk ((C \u2229 L) + I)/I < \u221e, and so I \u2287 (C \u2229 L)\u2265m for some m.\nTo prove that C/I has eventually d-periodic Hilbert function, we might as well now replace I by I +(C \u2229L),\nso we can assume that C/I is a factor of C/(C \u2229 L). Now N = C/(C \u2229 L) is g-torsionfree and has bounded\nHilbert function, since R/L has these properties. An easy argument shows then that dimk N/N g < \u221e. Then\nN \u2032 = C/I is a surjective image of N and so also dimk N \u2032 /N \u2032 g < \u221e. Then another easy argument shows\nthat this forces N \u2032 to have eventually d-periodic Hilbert function, as needed.\nFinally, if R has a minimal special ideal, then as in Remark 6.6 there is a unique ideal L\u2032 of R which is\nminimal in tails and such that R/L\u2032 is g-torsionfree. Then necessarily L\u2032 \u2286 L, and so we can replace L in\nthe above argument by L\u2032 . Then any special ideal I of C has I \u2287 (L\u2032 \u2229 C)\u2265m for some m, and this implies\nthat L\u2032 \u2229 C is an ideal of C which is minimal in tails.\n\n\u0003\n\nNext, we handle the more complicated case of subrings of R that need not contain g. We now need to\nimpose the existence of a minimal special ideal to gain more traction.\n24\n\n\fTheorem 7.4. Assume Hypothesis 7.1, and assume in addition that R has a minimal special ideal.\n(1) A and R have a common ideal; in particular, R and A are equivalent orders.\n(2) If A is noetherian, then A \u2286 R is a finite extension.\nProof. (1) We have C = Ahgi = A + Ag + Ag 2 + . . . . Note for each n \u2265 0 that CA\u2265n = A\u2265n + A\u2265n g +\nA\u2265n g 2 + * * * = A\u2265n C. In particular, CA\u2265n is an ideal of C. Moreover, the Hilbert series of C/CA\u2265n\nP\nis at most as large as i\u22650 p(t)tid , where p(t) = hA/A\u2265n (t) is a polynomial since dimk A/A\u2265n < \u221e. So\n\nGK C/CA\u2265n \u2264 1, and CA\u2265n is a special ideal of C. Now C has a minimal special ideal, and all special\nfactor rings of C have eventually d-periodic Hilbert function, by Lemma 7.3(2). It is easy then to see that\nany descending chain of special ideals of C must eventually stabilize in tails. Thus dimk CA\u2265n0 /CA\u2265n < \u221e\nfor all n \u2265 n0 , some n0 .\nWe claim that CA\u2265n0 is a finitely generated right A-module. By the graded Nakayama Lemma, to show\nthis it suffices to show that dimk CA\u2265n0 /CA\u2265n0 A\u22651 < \u221e. Though we don't know that A is noetherian, we\ndo have that A is a finitely generated k-algebra by hypothesis. If e is the maximum degree of its generators,\nthen clearly A\u2265(e+n0 ) \u2286 A\u2265n0 A\u22651 . So it is enough to show that dimk CA\u2265n0 /CA\u2265(e+n0 ) < \u221e, which we\nalready showed above; the claim is proved. A symmetric proof shows that CA\u2265n0 is finitely generated on\ne is a finite ring extension.\ne = A + CA\u2265n0 , then A \u2286 A\nthe left over A. In conclusion, setting A\n\nWe have constructed a series of ring extensions as follows, where all rings have the same graded quotient\n\nring:\n(7.5)\n\ne = A + CA\u2265n0 \u2286 C \u2286 R.\nA\u2286A\n\ne and C \u2286 R are finite ring extensions (using Lemma 7.3(1)), and\nHere, both of the outer extensions A \u2286 A\n\nthus have a common ideal, by Lemma 7.2(1). Also, the extension A + CA\u2265n0 \u2286 C certainly has a common\n\nideal, namely CA\u2265n0 . By Lemma 7.2(2), the extension A \u2286 R has a common ideal, and A and R are\nequivalent orders.\n(2) Suppose that A is noetherian, and consider the argument in part (1) above and the chain of ring\ne = A + CA\u2265n0 is finite over A on both sides, it is also a noetherian ring in this\nextensions (7.5). Since A\n\ncase. Choosing any nonzero homogeneous element x \u2208 A\u2265n0 , we see that xC \u2286 A and so CA embeds in A;\nthus CA is Noetherian. Similarly, A C is noetherian. Thus A \u2286 C and C \u2286 R are finite ring extensions, and\ne < \u221e in this case.\nso A \u2286 R is also a finite extension. In fact, it is easy to see that dimk C/A\n\n\u0003\n\nIf in Hypothesis 7.1 we have that A \u2286 R is not just a finite extension but an equality in large degrees, then\n\none can expect to say more about how close A is to R. The following result studies this. There is a strong\nresult for the ring C, and a rather weaker one for a general A. We note that this result is not needed in the\nproof of Theorem 1.2, though it is used in Section 12 below in the classification of subrings of S generated in\ndegree 1. We also do not know if the extra hypotheses in part (1) of the following proposition are necessary.\nProposition 7.6. Assume the setup in Hypothesis 7.1, and suppose that dimk R/A < \u221e.\n25\n\n\f(1) If in addition A \u2286 R is a finite extension and (A \u2229 Rg)/(A \u2229 Rg 2 ) 6= 0, then A contains a special\nideal of R.\n(2) C contains a special ideal of R.\nProof. (1) Since A \u2286 R is a finite extension with Qgr (A) = Qgr (R), A and R have a common ideal by\nLemma 7.2(1). This ideal must have the form Jg n for some special ideal J of R, by Lemma 6.4(1). J has a\nfinite-dimensional extension J \u2032 such that R/J \u2032 is g-torsionfree (Lemma 6.4(2)), so possibly after increasing\nn we can replace J by J \u2032 and assume that R/J is g-torsionfree.\nWe have the following exact sequence:\n0 \u2192 (J \u2229 Rg)/Jg \u2192 J/Jg \u2192 R/Rg \u2192 R/(J + Rg) \u2192 0.\nHere, (J \u2229 Rg)/Jg \u223c\n= (M/J)[\u2212d], where M = {x \u2208 R|xg \u2208 J}. Then M/J is contained in the g-torsion\nsubmodule Z(R/J) of R/J. By choice of J, M = J and so (Rg \u2229 J)/Jg = 0. Thus J/Jg injects into R/Rg,\nand this is even an inclusion of R \u2212 R-bimodules. For the purposes of this proof, following the definition for\nrings, we call a bimodule M projectively simple if every sub-bimodule 0 6= N of M satisfies dimk M/N < \u221e.\nSince R/Rg is a projectively simple R \u2212 R-bimodule, by Lemma 3.2(1), clearly J/Jg is also a projectively\nsimple R \u2212 R-bimodule. Since multiplication by g induces a bimodule isomorphism Jg i\u22121 /Jg i \u2192 Jg i /Jg i+1\nfor each i, Jg i /Jg i+1 is also a projectively simple R \u2212 R-bimodule. Since dimk R/A < \u221e, it is then easy to\nsee that Jg i /Jg i+1 is also a projectively simple A \u2212 A-bimodule for each i.\nBy hypothesis, we can choose x \u2208 A \u2229 Rg \\ Rg 2 . Clearly we can also choose y \u2208 A \u2229 J \\ Rg, since\nwe have GK A/(A \u2229 J) \u2264 1, while GK A/A \u2229 Rg = GK A = 2. Then xi y \u2208 A \u2229 Jg i \\ Rg i+1 , and thus\n(A \u2229 Jg i )/(A \u2229 Jg i+1 ) 6= 0. Since (A \u2229 Jg i )/(A \u2229 Jg i+1 ) is a A \u2212 A sub-bimodule of Jg i /Jg i+1 , we conclude\nthat (A \u2229 Jg i )/(A \u2229 Jg i+1 ) equals Jg i /Jg i+1 in large degree.\nNow recall that Jg n \u2286 A. So there exists an i \u2265 0 minimal with the property that (Jg i )\u2265m \u2286 A for\nsome m \u2265 0. Suppose i > 0. Since (A \u2229 Jg i\u22121 )/(A \u2229 Jg i ) is equal in large degree to Jg i\u22121 /Jg i , and\nA \u2229 Jg i \u2287 (Jg i )\u2265m for some m, we conclude that A \u2229 Jg i\u22121 is equal in large degree to Jg i\u22121 . Then\n(Jg i\u22121 )\u2265m\u2032 \u2286 A for some m\u2032 , contradicting the choice of i. So i = 0, and A contains a special ideal of R of\nthe form J\u2265m .\n(2) We have that C \u2286 R is a finite extension by Lemma 7.3(1), and clearly (C \u2229 Rg)/(C \u2229 Rg 2 ) 6= 0 since\ng \u2208 C. Taking A = C in part (1), the result is immediate.\n\n\u0003\n\n8. Divisors of modules\nThe concept of a divisor associated to a GK-2 module is a basic tool in the study of the module category\nof the Sklyanin algebra S, and AS-regular algebras more generally. It was first studied by Ajitabh in [Aj1],\nand then also by Van den Bergh, De Naeghel, and others, for example see [Aj2], [AjV], [DeN]. We will see\nthat this concept is also very important for the study of the rings R(D). In this section, we recall some of the\nbasic definitions and properties of divisors of modules. At the end of the section, we apply the theory we have\n26\n\n\fdeveloped to line modules and their submodules; as it turns out, line modules will also be very important\nto the proof of Theorem 1.1(3). Throughout this section, let R be a ring satisfying Hypothesis 6.1, so\nthat g \u2208 Rd is a central element (many of the results work with minor adjustments if g is normal), and\nB = R/Rg = B(E, N , \u03c4 ).\nWe call M \u2208 gr-R admissible if GK M/M g \u2264 1. Since B is a GK-2 domain and M/M g \u2208 gr-B,\nthis is equivalent to the requirement that M/M g does not have a subfactor isomorphic to (a shift of) B.\nWe will associate divisors only to admissible modules. For admissible M , tensoring the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Rg \u2192 R \u2192 R/Rg \u2192 0 with M and considering the long exact sequence in Tor, we easily see that\n\u223c\nTorR\n1 (M, R/Rg) = {m \u2208 M |mg = 0}[\u2212d],\n\n(8.1)\n\nand that TorR\ni (M, R/Rg) = 0 for all i \u2265 2. We now define the divisor associated to an admissible module;\nthis is a variation on the original definition of Ajitabh, following Van den Bergh [VdB, p. 66], which has the\nadvantage of exactness as in Lemma 8.3(4) below.\nDefinition 8.2. Given M \u2208 gr-R which is admissible, let N = M/M g and N \u2032 = TorR\n1 (M, R/Rg). We define\ndiv M = C(N ) \u2212 C(N \u2032 ) \u2208 Div E, in the notation of Definition 3.4.\nFor the preceding definition to make sense, we need GK TorR\n1 (M, R/Rg) \u2264 1 when M is admissible. This\nfollows from (8.1) and part (1) of the next lemma, which also collects several other easy properties of the\ndivisor.\nLemma 8.3. Let M \u2208 gr-R.\n(1) M is admissible if and only if GK M \u2264 2 and GK Z(M ) \u2264 1.\n(2) If M is admissible and g-torsionfree, then div M = C(M/M g); in particular, div M is effective.\n(3) For admissible M and i \u2208 Z, div M [i] = \u03c4 i (div M ).\n(4) The map M 7\u2192 div M is additive on short exact sequences of admissible modules in gr-R.\nProof. (1) Applying \u2212 \u2297 R/Rg to the exact sequence 0 \u2192 Z(M ) \u2192 M \u2192 M \u2032 = M/Z(M ) \u2192 0, one obtains\nan exact sequence\n* * * \u2192 Tor1 (M \u2032 , R/Rg) \u2192 Z(M )/Z(M )g \u2192 M/M g \u2192 M \u2032 /M \u2032 g \u2192 0.\nSince M \u2032 is g-torsionfree, in fact Tor1 (M \u2032 , R/Rg) = 0. Now if GK M \u2264 2 and GK Z(M ) \u2264 1, then\nGK Z(M )/Z(M )g \u2264 1. Then since GK M \u2032 \u2264 2 and M \u2032 is g-torsionfree, GK M \u2032 /M \u2032 g \u2264 1 by a simple\nHilbert series argument. So GK M/M g \u2264 1 from the exact sequence. Conversely, if GK M/M g \u2264 1, then\nGK Z(M )/Z(M )g \u2264 1 from the exact sequence. Since Z(M ) has a finite filtration Z(M ) \u2287 Z(M )g \u2287 * * * \u2287\nZ(M )g n = 0 for some n, and Z(M )g i /Z(M )g i+1 is a (shifted) surjective image of Z(M )g i\u22121 /Z(M )g i for\neach i, we see that GK Z(M ) \u2264 1. Also, GK M/M g \u2264 1 implies that GK M \u2264 2, by Hilbert series again.\n(2) This is immediate from the definition of div M and (8.1).\n27\n\n\f(3) It follows from a definition chase that for N \u2208 gr-B with GK N \u2264 1, we have C(N [i]) = \u03c4 i (C(N )),\nwhich implies the result.\n(4) Apply \u2212 \u2297 R/Rg to a given exact sequence 0 \u2192 M \u2192 N \u2192 P \u2192 0 of admissible modules.\nThen the desired result follows immediately from the corresponding long exact sequence in Tor (recall\nthat TorR\n2 (P, R/Rg) = 0), together with the fact that C(\u2212) is additive on short exact sequences of GK-1\nmodules in gr-B.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe divisor div M is an important tool in understanding g-torsionfree modules M \u2208 gr-R with GK M = 2.\nNamely, to get a picture of such modules M , one first tries to understand which linear equivalence classes of\ndivisors occur as div M . Such linear equivalence classes have been completely characterized when R = S is\nthe generic Sklyanin algebra, by work of De Naeghel [DeN]. The complete answer is quite intricate, but in\nthe sequel we only need the weak consequence in the following lemma, which already follows from Ajitabh's\nfirst paper [Aj1].\nDefinition 8.4. Let R satisfy Hypothesis 6.1. Then we define\ndiv2 (R) = {div M |M \u2208 gr-R is g-torsionfree and GK(M ) = 2} \u2286 Div E.\nLemma 8.5. Let S be a generic Sklyanin algebra. Then the image of div2 (S) in Pic E is countable.\nProof. Every g-torsionfree M \u2208 gr-S with GK M = 2 has an extension M \u2032 \u2287 M with dimk M \u2032 /M < \u221e,\nwhere M \u2032 has projective dimension 1 (see the discussion following [Aj1, Lemma 2.5]). Then by [Aj1, Lemma\n2.5], the linear equivalence class of div M = div M \u2032 is uniquely determined by the sequence of graded Betti\nnumbers appearing in the minimal projective resolution of M \u2032 , and there are clearly countably many such\nsequences of Betti numbers. (Technically, Ajitabh uses a different definition of the divisor div M in this\npaper, which it is well-known is equivalent to ours for the modules M in question [AjV, p. 1636].)\n\n\u0003\n\nWhile it would be interesting to study the divisors of modules over R(D) more carefully, our goal in this\npaper is more modest: we just want to prove the analog of Lemma 8.5 for the rings R(D), which we will\ndo in the next section. It simplifies arguments considerably to work modulo the divisors of GK-1 modules.\nThis is accomplished by the next definition, following an idea of Van den Bergh [VdB, p. 111].\nDefinition 8.6. Let H\u03c4 be the subgroup of Div E generated by {p \u2212 \u03c4 i (p)|p \u2208 E, i \u2208 Z}. Let Hl be\nthe subgroup of Div E of divisors linearly equivalent to 0, so that Pic E = Div E/Hl as usual. We define\nDivE = Div E/H\u03c4 , and PicE = Div E/(Hl + H\u03c4 ). For M \u2208 gr-R, let divM be the image in DivE of div M .\nLet div(R) = {divM |M \u2208 gr-R is admissible} \u2286 DivE.\nLemma 8.7.\n\n(1) If M \u2208 gr-R with GK M \u2264 1, then divM = 0. In particular, if M \u2208 gr-R is admissible\n\nthen div(M ) = div(M/Z(M )).\n(2) The image of div2 (R) in Pic E is countable if and only if the image of div(R) in Pic E is countable.\n28\n\n\fProof. (1) Note that div(\u2212) will still be additive on short exact sequences, using Lemma 8.3(4). So to\nprove that if M \u2208 gr-R with GK M \u2264 1, then divM = 0, it suffices to prove this when M is either\ng-torsion or g-torsionfree. If M is g-torsionfree, then GK M/M g = 0, and so div M = 0. If M is gtorsion, then it has a filtration by finitely many B-modules of GK-dimension at most 1. If N \u2208 gr-B, then\n\u2212d\n\u223c\nN \u2032 = TorR\n(C) for some effective divisor C; clearly then\n1 (N, R/Rg) = N [\u2212d], and so div N = C \u2212 \u03c4\n\ndiv(N ) = 0 by definition. The second statement follows, using Lemma 8.3(1).\n(2) Let \u03b8 : Pic E \u2192 Pic E be the quotient map. For any point p and i \u2208 Z, we have p \u2212 \u03c4 i (p) \u223c \u2212is, where\ns is the point such that \u03c4 is the translation \u03c4 (x) = x + s in the group structure. Thus Hl + H\u03c4 = Hl + Zs.\nIt follows that \u03b8 is a countable-to-1 map. Now let P be the image of div2 (R) in Pic E. Since by part (1)\nonly g-torsionfree modules of GK-2 matter in determining which divisors occur in div(R), it is easy to see\nthat \u03b8(P ) \u222a {0} is equal to the image of div(R) in Pic E. The result follows, since P is countable if and only\nif \u03b8(P ) is countable.\n\n\u0003\n\nNext, we study how the divisors of modules over R are related to divisors of modules over a Veronese\nring. Suppose that m \u2265 1 divides the degree d of the central element g of R. Then the mth Veronese ring\nL\nR\u2032 = R(m) = n\u22650 Rnm still satisfies the basic setup of this section: setting d\u2032 = d/m, we have g \u2208 Rd\u2032 \u2032\n\nis central in R\u2032 and R\u2032 /R\u2032 g \u223c\n= B(E, Nm , \u03c4 m ). Given a module M \u2208 gr-R, we can define a module\n= B (m) \u223c\nL\n\u221e\nM (m) = n=0 Mnm \u2208 gr-R\u2032 ; the rule M 7\u2192 M (m) defines a functor F : gr-R \u2192 gr-R\u2032 .\nLemma 8.8. Keep the notation of the preceding paragraph. Given any admissible M \u2208 gr-R, then divR M =\ndivR\u2032 M (m) . Moreover, div(R) = div(R\u2032 ).\n\nsheaf F . Then N (m)\n\nL\u221e\n\nH0 (E, F \u2297 Nn ) for some torsion\nL\u221e\nis isomorphic as a B \u2032 = R\u2032 /R\u2032 g = B(E, Nm , \u03c4 m )-module to n=0 H0 (E, F \u2297 Nmn ) in\n\nProof. First, suppose that N \u2208 gr-B is isomorphic in large degree to\n\nn=0\n\nlarge degree. Thus in the notation of Definition 3.4, CB (N ) = CB \u2032 (N (m) ).\n\nGiven M \u2208 gr-R, we have M (m) /M (m) g = (M/M g)(m) . Since all B-modules and B \u2032 -modules have a\nHilbert polynomial of the form f (n) = an + b for n \u226b 0, by Lemma 2.2(3), it is easy to check then that\nGKR M/M g = GKR\u2032 M (m) /M (m) g; thus M is admissible if and only if F (M ) = M (m) is. Now given an\nadmissible M \u2208 gr-R, setting P = {m \u2208 M |mg = 0}, we also have\n\u2032\n(m)\n(m)\n.\nTorR\n, R\u2032 /R\u2032 g) \u223c\n= TorR\n= P (m) [\u2212d/m] \u223c\n= P [\u2212d](m) \u223c\n1 (M, R/Rg)\n1 (M\n\nThus divR M = divR\u2032 M (m) follows from the previous paragraph.\nFinally, because R is generated in degree 1, the functor F descends to an equivalence of categories\nF : qgr-R \u2192 qgr-R\u2032 [AZ1, Proposition 5.10(3)]. In particular, any admissible M \u2032 \u2208 gr-R\u2032 is isomorphic\nin large degree to F (M ) for some M \u2208 gr-R, which must also then be admissible, as we have seen. The\nconclusion div(R) = div(R\u2032 ) follows.\n\n\u0003\n29\n\n\fRecall that a module M \u2208 gr-R is called a line module if M is cyclic, generated in degree 0, and hM (t) =\n1/(1 \u2212 t)2 . In the last result of this section, we completely describe the divisors of such a line module\nand its submodules, under the further condition that the central element g is in degree 1. In this case, by\nTheorem 6.3(2), every module N \u2208 gr-R has a Hilbert polynomial, and so a well-defined multiplicity.\nLemma 8.9. Let R satisfy Hypothesis 6.1, and in addition assume that g \u2208 R1 (d = 1). Let M \u2208 gr-R be a\nline module for R.\n(1) M is g-torsionfree, admissible, and div M = p is a single point.\ne with N \u2286 N\ne \u2286 M\n(2) If 0 6= N \u2286 M is a graded submodule, then there is a graded submodule N\n\ne /N < \u221e and N\ne \u223c\nsuch that dimk N\n= L[\u2212m] for some line module L. In particular, M is GK-2critical. Moreover, m is the multiplicity of M/N and div L = \u03c4 m\u2212n (p), where n is the multiplicity\nof Z(M/N ).\n\nProof. (1) Suppose first that GK Z(M ) = 2. Then M must contain a subfactor isomorphic to a shift of\nB. However, since dimk Bn = (deg N )n for n \u226b 0 by Riemann-Roch, any shift of BB is a module with\nmultiplicity deg N \u2265 2, whereas M has multiplicity 1 by the definition of a line module. This contradiction\nshows that GK Z(M ) \u2264 1 and thus M is admissible by Lemma 8.3(1).\nNow M \u2032 = M/Z(M ) is a g-torsionfree module with GK M \u2032 = 2. Note that GK M \u2032 /M \u2032 g = 1. Since R is\ngenerated in degree 1, the smallest possible Hilbert series of a GK-1 module which is cyclic and generated\nin degree 0 is the Hilbert series of a point module, 1/(1 \u2212 t). Thus HM \u2032 /M \u2032 g (t) \u2265 1/(1 \u2212 t). Since M \u2032 is\ng-torsionfree, HM \u2032 (t) \u2265 1/(1 \u2212 t)2 , forcing M \u2032 = M and Z(M ) = 0. This also shows that M/M g \u2208 gr-B\nactually is a point module, and div M = p is a single point as claimed.\n(2) Suppose that N is a nonzero homogeneous submodule of M . Let n \u2265 0 be maximal such that\nN \u2286 M g n . Then N g \u2212n \u2286 M . Let N g \u2212n \u2286 K \u2286 M be chosen so that K/N g \u2212n is the largest finitedimensional submodule of M/N g \u2212n .\nBy choice of n, K * M g. Since M is g-torsionfree, TorR\n1 (M, R/Rg) = 0 and so we have an exact sequence\n\u03b8\n\n0 \u2192 TorR\n1 (M/K, R/Rg) \u2192 K/Kg \u2192 M/M g \u2192 M/(K + M g) \u2192 0.\nBy assumption, \u03b8 6= 0. As we saw in the proof of part (1), M/M g is a point module. Since R is generated in\ndegree 1, necessarily im \u03b8 = (M/M g)\u2265m\u2032 for some m\u2032 \u2265 0. In particular, this forces GK K/Kg = 1, and since\nK is g-torsionfree, GK K = 2. Since M has Hilbert function dimk Mn = n+ 1, there is no choice but for K to\nhave a Hilbert polynomial of the form dimk Kn = n + b for n \u226b 0, for some b \u2264 1. Then dimk (K/Kg)n = 1\nfor n \u226b 0. Since im \u03b8 is also equal to a point module in large degree, this forces ker \u03b8 = TorR\n1 (M/K, R/Rg)\nto be finite-dimensional over k. On the other hand, TorR\n1 (M/K, R/Rg) is (a shift of) the largest submodule\nof M/K killed by g; by choice of K, ker \u03b8 = TorR\n1 (M/K, R/Rg) = 0.\nThus K/Kg \u223c\n= (M/M g)\u2265m\u2032 is a tail of a point module, generated in degree m\u2032 . Since K is g-torsionfree,\nK then has the Hilbert function of a line module shifted by \u2212m; since K is also generated in degree m\u2032\n30\n\n\fe = Kg n ,\nby the graded Nakayama lemma, we must have K \u223c\n= L[\u2212m\u2032 ] for some line module L. Setting N\ne /N < \u221e and N\ne \u223c\nwe have dimk N\n= L[\u2212m\u2032 \u2212 n]. In particular, it certainly follows from Hilbert series that\n\nGK M/N \u2264 1, and so M is GK-2-critical.\n\nSince we proved that TorR\n1 (M/K, R/Rg) = 0, we know that M/K is g-torsionfree with GKM/K \u2264 1,\nwhereas clearly K/N is g-torsion by construction. It follows that div M = div K, and so div K = p and\n\u2032\n\nthus div L = \u03c4 m (p), by Lemma 8.3(3). The number n is clearly the multiplicity of N g \u2212n /N , so also the\nmultiplicity of K/N = Z(M/N ), and m\u2032 is the multiplicity of M/K. Thus m = m\u2032 + n is the multiplicity of\nM/N .\n\n\u0003\n9. The exceptional line module for R(D)\n\nBeginning in this section, we refocus attention on the specific rings R(D) of interest. For the rest of\nthe paper, we use the notation introduced in Sections 4 and 5. Fix an effective divisor D\u2032 on E with\n0 \u2264 deg D\u2032 \u2264 6, and let D = D\u2032 + p \u2208 Div E for some point p \u2208 E. Throughout this section, let R = R(D)\n\u2032\n\nand R\u2032 = R(D\u2032 ). By Theorem 5.2, R = R/Rg = B(E, N , \u03c4 ) and R = R\u2032 /R\u2032 g = B(E, N \u2032 , \u03c4 ), where\nN = ID \u2297 M and N \u2032 = ID\u2032 \u2297 M. As usual, we write Y for the image of any subset Y \u2286 S under the\nhomomorphism S \u2192 S/Sg.\nOur goal is to study the ring extension R \u2286 R\u2032 , and show that intuitively the quasi-scheme Qgr-R behaves\nas a noncommutative blowup of Qgr-R\u2032 at the point p. In particular, we identify a line module in gr-R which\nbehaves as an exceptional object for this blowup. We also study the relationship between divisors of modules\nover the two rings R and R\u2032 . This will also allow us to show, by induction on deg D, that div2 (R) is contained\nin countably many linear equivalence classes of divisors.\nWe now construct the exceptional line module for the extension R \u2286 R\u2032 . It is closely related to the\nstructure of (R\u2032 /R)R .\nLemma 9.1. Fix R \u2286 R\u2032 as above.\n(1) J = {y \u2208 R|(R1\u2032 )y \u2208 R} is a right ideal of R such that LR = R/J is a line module. Moreover,\ndiv L = \u03c4 (p).\nL\u221e\n(2) (R\u2032 /R)R \u223c\n= i=0 L[\u2212i \u2212 1].\nProof. (1) Fix throughout the proof some z \u2208 R1\u2032 such R1\u2032 = R1 + kz. Clearly J = {x \u2208 R|zx \u2208 R}. Let\nM = k + R1\u2032 R = R + R1\u2032 R. Then we have\nM/R = zR + R/R \u223c\n= zR/(zR \u2229 R) \u223c\n= R/J[\u22121].\nt\nby Lemma 5.3. Thus R/J has the Hilbert series of a line module, and is obviously\n(1 \u2212 t)2\ngenerated in degree 0, so it is a line module.\n\nAlso, hM/R (t) =\n\nTo compute the divisor of L, recall that L/Lg = R/(Rg + J) = R/J must be a point module. The\nL\nequation R1\u2032 J \u2286 R forces J \u2286 n\u22650 H0 (E, I\u03c4 (p) \u2297 Nn ), by considering vanishing conditions. This forces the\n31\n\n\fpoint module P (\u03c4 (p)) =\nand div L = \u03c4 (p).\n\nL\n\nn\u22650\n\nH0 (E, k(\u03c4 (p)) \u2297 Nn ) to be a factor of R/J, so we must have R/J \u223c\n= P (\u03c4 (p))\n\n(2) Let z be as in part (1). For each n \u2265 0, we claim that we can choose an element wn \u2208 Rn so\nthat wn z 6\u2208 Rn\u2032 R1 . Clearly we can take w0 = 1. If we cannot choose such a wn for some n \u2265 1, then\nRn z \u2286 Rn\u2032 R1 , and this forces Rn R1\u2032 \u2286 Rn\u2032 R1 , and thus Rn R1\u2032 \u2286 Rn\u2032 R1 . But thinking of these as subspaces\n\u2032\n\u2032\n= H0 (E, Nn+1\n) determined by certain vanishing conditions (using Lemma 3.1), clearly this is\nof Rn+1\n\nimpossible: Rn R1\u2032 is the subspace of sections vanishing along the divisor p + \u03c4 \u22121 (p) + * * * + \u03c4 \u2212n+1 (p), while\nRn\u2032 R1 is the subspace of sections vanishing along \u03c4 \u2212n (p). This proves the claim, so we fix such elements wn .\nWe claim that the R-submodules M (n) = (wn zR + R)/R of R\u2032 /R for n \u2265 0 are independent and span\nR\u2032 /R. First we show spanning. We claim that for each n \u2265 1, we have N (n) = M (0) + M (1) + * * * +\n\u2032\nM (n\u22121) = (R + R\u2264n\nR)/R, from which spanning will immediately follow. The base case n = 1 is by\n\u2032\ndefinition. Now assume the equation holds for some n, and consider N (n+1) = (R + R\u2264n\nR + wn zR)/R. We\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\nhave dimk Rn+1\n\u2212 dimk Rn\u2032 R1 = 1; to see this, note that dimk Rn+1 \u2212 dimk Rn R1 = 1 using Lemma 3.1, and\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nRn+1\n\u2229 T g = Rn\u2032 g \u2286 Rn\u2032 R1 . Moreover, wn z \u2208 Rn+1\n\\ Rn\u2032 R1 by choice of wn ; thus Rn+1\n= Rn\u2032 R1 + kwn z,\n\u2032\nand it follows that N (n+1) = (R + R\u2264(n+1)\nR)/R.\n\nNext, note that M (n) is cyclic and generated in degree n + 1. Then M (n) \u223c\n= (R/K (n) )[\u2212n \u2212 1], where\nK (n) = {y \u2208 R|wn zy \u2208 R}. Clearly we have J \u2286 K (n) , so M (n) is isomorphic to a factor module of\nX tn+1\nt\n=\n, which is clearly the same\nL[\u2212n \u2212 1]. However, Theorem 5.2 implies that hR\u2032 /R (t) =\n3\n(1 \u2212 t)\n(1 \u2212 t)2\nn\u22650\nL\nP\n(n)\n= R\u2032 /R, as we showed in the previous paragraph,\nas the Hilbert series of \u221e\nn\u22650 M\nn=0 L[\u2212n \u2212 1]. Since\n\nthe only possible conclusion is that K (n) = J for all n, and that the submodules M (n) are also independent.\nL\u221e\n\u223c L\u221e M (n) \u223c\n\u0003\nThus R\u2032 /R =\n= n=0 L[\u2212n \u2212 1].\nn=0\n\nDefinition 9.2. We call the line module L appearing in the preceding theorem the exceptional line module\n(for the extension R = R(D) \u2286 R(D\u2032 ) = R\u2032 ). A full subcategory of an abelian category is called a\nSerre subcategory if its set of objects is closed under subobjects, factor objects, and extensions. Let Ce\n\nbe the smallest Serre subcategory of Gr-R containing L and closed under shifts and direct limits, and let\ne \u2286 Qgr-R be the corresponding full subcategory of Qgr-R. We call C \u2286 Qgr-R the exceptional\nC = \u03c0(C)\n\ncategory (again, for a fixed choice of extension R \u2286 R\u2032 .)\n\nWe do not spend much time studying the geometric properties of the quasi-schemes Qgr-R(D) in this\npaper; a lot of information about these quasi-schemes will flow from [VdB], once the connections with that\npaper are fully established. Because it is easy, however, we do offer one theorem which further justifies the\nidea that Qgr-R should be thought of as a blowup of Qgr-R\u2032 . The following result shows that the difference\nbetween Qgr-R and Qgr-R\u2032 is determined entirely by the exceptional category.\n\n32\n\n\fe be the subcategory of Gr-R\u2032 consisting of all objects\nTheorem 9.3. Let Ce and C be as in Definition 9.2. Let D\n\ne and let D = \u03c0(D)\ne \u2286 Qgr-R\u2032 . Then there is an equivalence of quotient categories\nNR\u2032 such that NR \u2208 C,\nQgr-R/C \u2243 Qgr-R\u2032 /D.\n\nProof. Define functors F : Gr-R \u2192 Gr-R\u2032 and G : Gr-R\u2032 \u2192 Gr-R by F (M ) = M \u2297R R\u2032 and G(NR\u2032 ) = NR .\nWe claim that F descends to a functor F : Qgr-R/C \u2192 Qgr-R\u2032 /D. For this, we first note that if M \u2208 Gr-R,\nthen we have an exact sequence in Gr-R as follows:\n(9.4)\n\nR\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n0 \u2192 TorR\n1 (M, R ) \u2192 Tor1 (M, R /R) \u2192 M \u2192 M \u2297R R \u2192 M \u2297R (R /R) \u2192 0.\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\ne It easily follows that TorR\nBy Lemma 9.1(2), clearly (R\u2032 /R) \u2208 C.\n1 (M, R /R) and M \u2297R (R /R) are also\n\ne Thus if M \u2208 C,\ne then (M \u2297R R\u2032 )R is in Ce also, so F (M ) \u2208 D.\ne We also see from the exact sequence\nin C.\n\n\u2032\n\u2032 e\ne\nb\nthat TorR\n1 (M, R ) \u2208 D for any M \u2208 Gr-R. Thus the induced functor F : Gr-R \u2192 Gr-R /D is an exact\n\ne = 0. By the universal property of the quotient category, Fb induces a functor\nfunctor such that Fb (C)\ne but since Tors-R \u2286 Ce and Tors-R\u2032 \u2286 D,\ne this is the same thing as a functor\nF : Gr-R/Ce \u2192 Gr-R\u2032 /D;\n\nF : Qgr-R/C \u2192 Qgr-R\u2032 /D, as claimed. Since G is already itself an exact functor, a similar but easier\nargument shows that G descends to a functor G : Qgr-R\u2032 /D \u2192 Qgr-R/C. In addition, the same exact\nsequence (9.4) above easily yields that G F is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor.\nNow for N \u2208 Gr-R\u2032 , there is a natural map \u03c6N : F G(N ) \u2192 N given by the multiplication map \u03c6 :\nN \u2297R R\u2032 \u2192 N . We claim that this descends to give a natural isomorphism between F G and the identity\ne or equivalently that (ker \u03c6)R \u2208 C.\ne Suppose\nfunctor. Since \u03c6 is surjective, it suffices to show that ker \u03c6 \u2208 D,\nP\nthat 0 6= s = (ni \u2297 ri ) \u2208 ker \u03c6 is a homogenous element, where ni \u2208 N and ri \u2208 R\u2032 are homogeneous.\n\n\u2032\nDefine for each n \u2265 1 the right R-ideal J (n) = {y \u2208 R|(R\u2264n\n)y \u2286 R}. We can choose some n \u2265 1 for which\n\nri J (n) \u2286 R for all i, and then clearly sJ (n) = 0. Thus (ker \u03c6)R is a direct limit of factors of the modules\n\u2032\nR/J (n) ; it suffices to show that R/J (n) \u2208 Ce for all n \u2265 1. However, letting {v1 , . . . , vm } be a k-basis of R\u2264n\n,\nT\nm\ne it easily follows\nwe have that J (n) = i=1 r. annR (vi + R), where vi + R \u2208 R\u2032 /R for each i. Since R\u2032 /R \u2208 C,\n\nthat each R/ r. annR (vi + R), and hence also R/J (n) , is in Ce as needed.\n\n\u0003\n\nIntuitively, modding out the exceptional category C from Qgr-R corresponds to removing the exceptional\n\nline. In accord with the intuition that Qgr-R should be thought of as a blowup of Qgr-R\u2032 at the point p, one\nmight hope that it would be enough to mod out from Qgr-R\u2032 a subcategory generated by the simple object\ncorresponding to the point p. However, in general it seems that some R\u2032 -modules of GK-2 are entangled and\ne See Proposition 11.2(4) below for an example.\nmust get included in D.\n\nIn the next result, we compare the divisors of admissible modules over the two rings R and R\u2032 . Not\n\nsurprisingly, the difference between div(R) and div(R\u2032 ) is generated entirely by the divisor of the exceptional\nline module.\nProposition 9.5. Let R = R(D) \u2286 R\u2032 = R(D\u2032 ) as above.\n(1) Suppose that M \u2208 gr-R\u2032 is admissible. Then MR \u2208 gr-R, MR is admissible, and div MR = div MR\u2032 .\n33\n\n\f(2) If M \u2208 gr-R is in the exceptional category Ce of Definition 9.2, then divM = np \u2208 DivE for some\nn \u2265 0.\n\n(3) div(R) \u2286 {G + np | G \u2208 div(R\u2032 ), n \u2208 Z} \u2286 DivE.\nProof. (1) Recall that R\u2032 /R\u2032 g = B \u2032 = B(E, N \u2032 , \u03c4 ) and R/Rg = B = B(E, N , \u03c4 ). For any N \u2208 gr-B \u2032 with\nGK N \u2264 1, we have NB \u2208 gr-B, and C(NB \u2032 ) = C(NB ), by Lemma 3.5.\nNow for M \u2208 gr-R\u2032 admissible, let N = M/M g \u2208 gr-B \u2032 , where GK N \u2264 1. Then NB \u2208 gr-B, and it\nfollows from the graded Nakayama lemma that MR \u2208 gr-R. Clearly MR is admissible. Moreover,\n\u2032\nR\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u223c\n\u223c\nTorR\n1 (M, R /R g)R = {m \u2208 M |mg = 0}[\u22121] = Tor1 (MR , R/Rg).\n\nThus div MR = div MR\u2032 follows from the definition of the divisor.\n(2) We have that M is filtered by subfactors of shifts of the exceptional line module L, so since div is\nadditive on exact sequences, it suffices to prove the result when M is a subfactor of a shift of L. Since L\nis GK-2-critical by Lemma 8.9(2), using Lemma 8.7(1) it suffices to assume M is a nonzero submodule of a\nshift of L. But then div M = \u03c4 i (p) for some i \u2208 Z by Lemma 8.9 and Lemma 9.1(1), so divM = p.\n(3) Let M \u2208 gr-R be admissible. Consider again the exact sequence of right R-modules\n\u03b8\n\n* * * \u2192 Tor1R (M, R\u2032 /R) \u2192 M \u2192 M \u2032 \u2192 M \u2297R (R\u2032 /R) \u2192 0,\nwhere M \u2032 = M \u2297R R\u2032 . As we already observed in the proof of Theorem 9.3, the terms Tor1R (M, R\u2032 /R) and\ne and thus ker \u03b8 \u2208 Ce and im \u03b8 \u2208 C.\ne Note that M \u2032 \u2208 gr-R\u2032 ,\nM \u2297R (R\u2032 /R) must be in the exceptional category C,\n\nand that M \u2032 /M \u2032 g = (M/M g) \u2297R R\u2032 = (M/M g) \u2297B B \u2032 . We have GKB M/M g \u2264 1, so that M/M g is a\n\nGoldie-torsion module over the domain B. It follows that (M/M g) \u2297B B \u2032 is Goldie-torsion over B \u2032 , which\n\u0001\nforces GKB \u2032 (M/M g) \u2297B B \u2032 \u2264 1 also. Thus M \u2032 \u2208 gr-R\u2032 is admissible. Then by part (1), MR\u2032 is admissible,\n\ndiv(MR\u2032 \u2032 ) = divMR\u2032 , and div(MR ) \u2286 {G + np | G \u2208 div(R\u2032 ), n \u2208 Z} follows immediately from the exact\nsequence and part (2).\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 9.6. Let R = R(D) for any effective D with 0 \u2264 deg D \u2264 7. Then the image of div2 (R) in Pic E\nis countable.\nProof. Let S be the generic Sklyanin algebra. By Lemma 8.5, we know that the image of div2 (S) in Pic E\nis countable. Thus the image of div(S) in PicE is countable, by Lemma 8.7. Letting T = S (3) as usual,\nthen since div(S) = div(T ) by Lemma 8.8, the image of div(T ) in PicE is countable. It now follows, by\nProposition 9.5(3) and induction on deg D, that the image of div(R(D)) in PicE is countable. Thus the\nimage of div2 (R) in Pic E is countable, by Lemma 8.7 again.\n\n\u0003\n\nAs an application of the previous results, we can now prove the following interesting result about the\ndivisors of the line modules of the ring R(D).\nTheorem 9.7. Let R = R(D) where 0 \u2264 deg D \u2264 7. Then the set {div L|L is a line module for R} is finite.\n34\n\n\fProof. First, we reduce to the case of an uncountable base field. Let k \u2286 l be a field extension where l\nis uncountable and algebraically closed. If M \u2208 gr-R is a line module, then M \u2297k l is a line module over\nRl = R \u2297k l, which is just R(D) constructed over the bigger field l. Also, identifying the points of E with a\nsubset of E \u00d7Spec k Spec l, div MR = div(M \u2297k l)Rl . Thus we see that it is enough to prove the result over\nthe base field l. Using this, we assume for the rest of the proof that k is uncountable.\nNow since R is strongly noetherian, by Theorem 6.3(1), the work of Artin and Zhang shows that there is a\nprojective scheme X, the line scheme, which parameterizes the line modules for R. We recall its construction:\nfor any fixed degree m, one considers the set of all graded subspaces J0 \u2295 J1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Jm \u2286 R0 \u2295 R1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Rm\nsuch that dimk (R/J)n = n + 1 for all 0 \u2264 n \u2264 m, and Ji Rj \u2286 Ji+j for all i, j with i + j \u2264 m. This is a\nclosed subscheme of a product of projective Grassmannians, and so is a projective scheme Xm . Now [AZ2,\nL\nCorollary E4.5] shows that there is some finite m such that any such m\nn=0 Jn generates a right ideal J of\nR such that R/J is a line module; then for this m, X = Xm is the line scheme.\n\nRecall that the divisor of a line module over R is a single point, by Lemma 8.9. We claim that given any\npoint q \u2208 E, the set of line modules M such that div M = q forms a closed subset of X, which we write\nas Xq . Given a line module M = R/J, the condition div M = q is equivalent to R/J + Rg \u223c\n= P (q), where\nP (q) \u2208 gr-B is the point module associated to the point q. But there is a unique right ideal I \u2287 Rg of R\nLm\nLm\nsuch that R/I \u223c\n= P (q), so it is also equivalent to demand that n=0 Jn \u2286 n=0 In . This is clearly a further\nclosed condition in the construction above, proving the claim.\n\nNow Corollary 9.6 shows that the image of div2 (R) in Pic E is countable. Since every line module M is\nGK-2 and g-torsionfree (Lemma 8.9(1)), \u03a9 = {div M |M is a line module for R} \u2286 div2 (R). But no two single\nS\npoint divisors on E are linearly equivalent, so \u03a9 is a countable set of points of E. But then X = q\u2208\u03a9 Xq\n\nexpresses X as a countable disjoint union of closed subvarieties. Since k is uncountable, this is possible only\nif the set \u03a9 is finite.\n\n\u0003\n\n10. The main classification theorem\nThe first two lemmas of this section begin to make clear how the special ideals of the ring R(D) are closely\nconnected to the line modules of R(D). We will then use the fact that the divisors of line modules of R(D)\nare very restricted to show, in Theorem 10.4 below, that R(D) has a minimal special ideal, completing the\nproof of Theorem 1.1. Our main classification result, Theorem 1.2, will then quickly follow from our previous\nresults in Section 7.\nFor the next two lemmas, we maintain the setup of the previous section. So let D\u2032 be an effective divisor\non E with 0 \u2264 deg D\u2032 \u2264 6, and let D = D\u2032 + p for some point p \u2208 E. Let R = R(D) and R\u2032 = R(D\u2032 ), and\nlet LR be the exceptional line module for the extension R \u2286 R\u2032 , as in Definition 9.2.\nLemma 10.1. There is a unique smallest nonzero submodule N \u2286 L such that L/N is g-torsionfree.\n35\n\n\fProof. Recall that div L = \u03c4 (p) by Lemma 9.1(1). Suppose that L/N is g-torsionfree for some submodule\n0 6= N \u2286 L. By Lemma 8.9(2), N \u223c\n= L\u2032 [\u2212m] is a shift of a line module L\u2032 with div L\u2032 = \u03c4 m+1 (p). By\nTheorem 9.7, there can be only finitely many values of m for which \u03c4 m+1 (p) is the divisor of a line module\nover R. Thus there is an upper bound on the possible value of m, which is also the multiplicity of the GK-1\nmodule L/N .\nThus we may pick a submodule 0 6= N \u2286 L such that L/N is g-torsionfree and the multiplicity m of\nL/N is maximal among all such choices. If 0 6= N \u2032 \u2286 L is another submodule with L/N \u2032 g-torsionfree, then\nL/(N \u2229 N \u2032 ) is also g-torsionfree. L/(N \u2229 N \u2032 ) must then also have multiplicity m, so N \u2229 N \u2032 is equal to N\nin large degree. By g-torsionfreeness, N \u2229 N \u2032 = N and so N \u2286 N \u2032 .\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 10.2. There is a special ideal I of R with the following property: given any (possibly infinite)\nL\ndirect sum of shifts of L, say M =\nL[ai ], and N \u2208 gr-R such that N is isomorphic to a subfactor of M ,\n\nGK N \u2264 1, and N is g-torsionfree, then I \u2286 r. annR N .\n\nProof. Let N be as in the statement. Since N is finitely generated, we can choose submodules N \u2032\u2032 \u2286 N \u2032 \u2286 M\nwith N \u2032 , N \u2032\u2032 \u2208 gr-R such that N \u223c\n= N \u2032 /N \u2032\u2032 . Then N \u2032 is contained in finitely many terms in the direct sum\nL\ncomprising M , so we may replace M if necessary by a finite sum M = m\ni=1 L[ai ] for some shifts ai \u2208 Z. We\nL\nadjust the choices of N \u2032 and N \u2032\u2032 further. If N \u2032 \u2229 L[aj ] = 0 for some j, then N \u2032 embeds in M = i6=j L[ai ],\nso we might as well replace M by a direct sum of fewer terms. Thus we can assume that N \u2032 \u2229 L[ai ] 6= 0\n\nfor all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m. If N \u2032\u2032 \u2229 L[ai ] = 0 for some i, then the nonzero submodule N \u2032 \u2229 L[ai ] of L[ai ] embeds in\nN . But L[ai ] is GK-2-critical and so GK(N \u2032 \u2229 L[ai ]) = 2, contradicting GK N = 1; thus N \u2032\u2032 \u2229 L[ai ] 6= 0\nfor all i. Now for each i, consider the g-torsion submodule Z(L[ai ]/(N \u2032\u2032 \u2229 L[ai ])) = Pi /(N \u2032\u2032 \u2229 L[ai ]), where\nL\nPi \u2286 L[ai ], and let P =\nPi \u2286 M . Since N is g-torsionfree, N \u223c\n= (N \u2032 + P )/(N \u2032\u2032 + P ), so N is isomorphic\ne be the\nto a subfactor of M/P . But now L[ai ]/Pi is a g-torsionfree proper factor module of L[ai ]. Let L\n\ne is g-torsionfree, as constructed in Lemma 10.1; then\nunique minimal nonzero submodule of L such that L/L\nL\ne i ] \u2286 Pi . Thus N is a subfactor of\ne i ]. By Lemma 6.4(3), I = r. annR L/L\ne is a special ideal,\nL[a\nL[ai ]/L[a\nand clearly I kills N .\n\n\u0003\n\nWe are now about ready to show, in the following theorem, that R(D) always has a minimal special ideal.\nFirst, we recall the following fact, which is essentially proved in [ATV2].\nLemma 10.3. The generic Sklyanin algebra S and its Veronese ring T = S (3) have no homogeneous factor\nrings of GK-dimension 1.\nProof. Looking at the localization \u039b = T [g \u22121 ] = S[g \u22121 ](3) , the degree-0 piece \u039b0 is a simple ring [ATV2,\nCorollary 7.9]. Then if T has a homogeneous factor ring T /I of GK 1, it has such a factor ring T /I \u2032 which\nis also g-torsionfree, by Lemma 6.4(2); in this case, (T /I \u2032 )[g \u22121 ]0 is a proper nonzero factor ring of \u039b0 , a\ncontradiction. The result for S follows the same way.\n36\n\n\u0003\n\n\fTheorem 10.4. (Theorem 1.1(3)) Let R = R(D) for any effective D with 0 \u2264 deg D \u2264 7. Then R has a\nminimal special ideal.\nProof. (1) The proof is by induction on deg D. For the base case, D = 0 and R(D) = T , so the result is\ntrivial by Lemma 10.3 (T itself is minimal in tails.)\nNow assume that deg D \u2265 1, let D = D\u2032 + p for some p, and suppose that we have proven the theorem for\nR\u2032 = R(D\u2032 ). Consider a special ideal J of R. We have a chain of special R-ideals J \u2286 R\u2032 J \u2229 R \u2286 R\u2032 JR\u2032 \u2229 R.\nIt is easy to see that M = (R\u2032 JR\u2032 \u2229 R)/(R\u2032 J \u2229 R) is isomorphic, as a right R-module, to a subfactor of\nsome direct sum of copies of shifts of (R\u2032 /R)R . Also, by Lemma 9.1(2), each (R\u2032 /R)R is isomorphic to a\ndirect sum of copies of shifts of the exceptional line module L for R \u2286 R\u2032 , as defined in Definition 9.2. Since\nR/(R\u2032 J \u2229 R) is a special factor ring, dimk Z(M ) < \u221e by Lemma 6.4(2). Thus if M \u2032 = M/Z(M ), then M \u2032 is\na g-torsionfree, GK-dimension 1 subfactor of a direct sum of shifts of L. If I is the special ideal constructed\nin Lemma 10.2, we conclude that M \u2032 I = 0. Thus M I\u2265m1 = 0 for some m1 .\nSimilarly, N = (R\u2032 J \u2229 R)/J is isomorphic as a left R-module to a subfactor of some direct sum of copies\nof shifts of R (R\u2032 /R). Because of Theorem 5.4(3), all right-sided results in this paper have left-sided analogs.\nA left-sided version of the argument in the last paragraph then constructs a special ideal H of R satisfying\nH\u2265m2 N = 0 for some m2 .\nNow R\u2032 JR\u2032 is clearly a special ideal of R\u2032 (otherwise by Lemma 6.4(1), R\u2032 JR\u2032 \u2286 R\u2032 g and so J \u2286 R\u2032 g \u2229R =\nRg, a contradiction). By the induction hypothesis, R\u2032 has a special ideal K which is minimal in tails, and\nso K\u2265m3 \u2286 R\u2032 JR\u2032 for some m3 . Then H\u2265m2 (K\u2265m3 \u2229 R)I\u2265m1 \u2286 J. This implies that [H(K \u2229 R)I]\u2265m4 \u2286 J,\nfor some m4 . Since G = H(K \u2229 R)I is a special ideal of R which is independent of J, we see that G is an\nideal which is minimal in tails for R.\n\n\u0003\n\nAt this point, we have done all of the hard work necessary to prove the main classification theorem of the\npaper, Theorem 1.2, and we now put all of the pieces together.\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Recall the setup of the theorem: we have V \u2286 T1 and A = khV i \u2286 T , and we assume\nthat Qgr (A) = Qgr (T ). As usual, let an overline indicate the image of subsets under the homomorphism\nT \u2192 T /T g \u223c\n= B(E, M, \u03c4 ). Now V generates some subsheaf N of M on E. Then N = ID \u2297 M for some\ndivisor D on E, and A \u2286 R(D). We claim that 0 \u2264 deg D \u2264 7, or equivalently that deg N \u2265 2. If not, then\nH0 (E, N ) \u2264 1 by Riemann-Roch, and thus either V = kg or V = kx + kg for some x \u2208 T1 . In either case,\nsince g is central, clearly A is commutative, and so Qgr (A) = Qgr (T ) cannot possibly hold; this contradiction\nproves the claim.\nNow Lemma 3.2(3) makes clear that A is equal in large degree to some B(F, N \u2032 , \u03c4 \u2032 ) \u2286 B(E, N , \u03c4 ), where\nF may be a different elliptic curve, but in any case A \u2286 R(D) = B(E, N , \u03c4 ) is a finite ring extension. Thus\nHypothesis 7.1 holds, and the results of Section 7 apply. Since R(D) is now known to have a minimal special\nideal by Theorem 10.4, Theorem 7.4(1) shows that A and R(D) are equivalent orders. Since the rings R(D)\nare maximal orders by Theorem 6.7, it is now clear that the rings R(D) are the only subrings of T generated\n37\n\n\fin degree 1 which have the same graded quotient ring as T and which are maximal orders. Clearly a given\nA is an equivalent order only to the smallest R(D) containing it, so the D with this property is unique.\nTheorem 7.4(2) also implies that A \u2286 R(D) is a finite ring extension if A is noetherian; in particular, this\ndoes hold if g \u2208 A1 , by Lemma 7.3(1).\n\n\u0003\n11. Examples\n\nSome of the complicated (and interesting) behavior of the rings R(D) happens when D contains multiple\npoints on the same \u03c4 = \u03c3 3 -orbit. In this section, we work out some of the features of one of the simplest\nsuch cases. This will provide explicit examples of a number of phenomena studied in previous sections. In\nthis section and the next, we again need the notation for point spaces W (p) \u2286 S1 , as in Section 4.\nThe following is the example that will occupy us for most of this section.\nExample 11.1. Fix any p \u2208 E, let D = p + \u03c3 \u22123 (p) \u2208 Div E, and set R = R(D). It will be interesting to\ncompare the two different ways in which R(D) can be thought of as an iterated blowup of T , so we need\nsome more notation. Set R\u2032 = R(p) and R\u2032\u2032 = R(\u03c3 \u22123 (p)). The first sequence of blowups is R = R(D) \u2286\nR\u2032 = R(p) \u2286 T . Let J = {x \u2208 R|R1\u2032 x \u2286 R}, so that L = R/J is the exceptional line module for the\nblowup R \u2286 R\u2032 as in Definition 9.2; similarly, let J \u2032 = {x \u2208 R\u2032 |T1 x \u2286 R\u2032 }, so that L\u2032 = R\u2032 /J \u2032 is the\nexceptional line module of R\u2032 \u2286 T . The other sequence of blowups is R = R(D) \u2286 R\u2032\u2032 = R(\u03c3 \u22123 (p)) \u2286 R.\nLet J \u25e6 = {x \u2208 R|R1\u2032\u2032 x \u2286 R}, so that L\u25e6 = R/J \u25e6 is the exceptional line module for R \u2286 R\u2032\u2032 ; and let\nJ \u2032\u2032 = {x \u2208 R\u2032\u2032 |T1 x \u2286 R\u2032\u2032 }, so that L\u2032\u2032 = R\u2032\u2032 /J \u2032\u2032 is the exceptional line module of R\u2032\u2032 \u2286 T .\nProposition 11.2. Example 11.1 has the following properties.\n(1) Let V = W (p)W (\u03c3 \u22122 (p))S1 , thought of as a subspace of R1 . Then I = V R is a special ideal of R\nsuch that R/I is a g-torsionfree point module.\n(2) The subring A = khV i of R is equal to k + I, and A is neither right nor left noetherian.\n(3) J \u2286 I, and (I/J)R is isomorphic to the shifted line module R/J \u25e6 [\u22121].\ne in the\n(4) L\u2032R \u223c\n= L\u25e6R . In particular, L\u2032R\u2032 \u2208 gr-R\u2032 is a GK-2 module such that L\u2032R \u2208 Ce and L\u2032R\u2032 \u2208 D,\nnotation of Theorem 9.3.\n\nBefore proving the proposition, we make some remarks on the significance of these properties. Part (1)\ngives an explicit example of a special ideal in a ring R(D). Part (2) shows that degree-1 generated subrings\nA of T which do not contain the central element g can indeed be non-noetherian; also, A \u2286 R need not be\na finite ring extension. Part (3) gives an explicit example where an exceptional line module (in this case\nL\u223c\n= R/J) contains another shifted line module (in this case L\u25e6 [\u22121], a shift of the exceptional module for\nthe other blowup sequence), where the factor is GK-1 g-torsionfree. This is exactly the phenomenon that\nLemma 10.1 is designed to control. Finally, part (4) shows, as was claimed earlier, that GK-2 modules\nare sometimes among those that need to be quotiented out from Qgr-R\u2032 in the equivalence of categories\nQgr-R/C \u223c Qgr-R\u2032 /D in Theorem 9.3.\n38\n\n\fProof of Proposition 11.2. (1) We have V = W (p)W (\u03c3 \u22122 (p))S1 \u2286 S3 = T1 . By Lemma 4.6(1), we know\nthat dimk V = 7 and g 6\u2208 V .\nAn easy calculation, \"moving point spaces\" using Lemma 4.1(1), shows that T1 V = R2\u2032\u2032 , so that V \u2286 J1\u2032\u2032 .\nThe Hilbert series of J \u2032\u2032 is easily determined, since the Hilbert series of R\u2032\u2032 is known and R\u2032\u2032 /J \u2032\u2032 is a line\nt2 + 7t\nmodule, to be hJ \u2032\u2032 (t) =\n. In particular, we see from this that V = J1\u2032\u2032 , since dimk J1\u2032\u2032 = 7 also. We\n(1 \u2212 t)3\nclaim that J \u2032\u2032 = V R\u2032\u2032 , so that J \u2032\u2032 is generated in degree 1 as a right R\u2032\u2032 -ideal. Since R\u2032\u2032 /J \u2032\u2032 is g-torsionfree,\nt2 + 7t\n. Also V R\u2032\u2032 \u2286 J \u2032\u2032 , and the Hilbert series\nby Lemma 8.9(1), we have J \u2032\u2032 \u2229 R\u2032\u2032 g = J \u2032\u2032 g. Then hJ \u2032\u2032 (t) =\n(1 \u2212 t)2\nof V R\u2032\u2032 is easily calculated, using Lemma 3.1, to be the same as that of J \u2032\u2032 , so that V R\u2032\u2032 = J \u2032\u2032 . Then we\nhave hV R\u2032\u2032 (t) \u2265 hV R\u2032\u2032 (t)/(1 \u2212 t) = hJ \u2032\u2032 /(1 \u2212 t) = hJ \u2032\u2032 (t), forcing V R\u2032\u2032 = J \u2032\u2032 , which proves the claim.\nIt is easy to see that V \u2286 R1 , where dimk R1 = 8, so clearly we have V + kg = R1 .\nV\n\n2\n\n= W (p)W (\u03c3\n\n\u22122\n\n(p))S1 W (p)W (\u03c3\n\n\u22122\n\n(p))S1 . By moving point spaces, we see that W (\u03c3\n\n\u22122\n\nConsider\n\n(p))S1 W (p) =\n\nW (\u03c3 \u22122 (p))W (\u03c3 \u22121 (p))S1 , and this contains g by Lemma 4.6(1). Thus V 2 \u2287 W (p)gW (\u03c3 \u22122 (p))S1 = V g. This\nimplies that R1 V = (V + kg)V = V 2 , and similarly V R1 = V 2 . Also, then V 2 + kg 2 = R1 V + kg 2 =\nR1 V + V g + kg 2 = R1 V + R1 g = R1 (V + kg) = R2 . An inductive argument gives V n + kg n = Rn and\nV Rn\u22121 = V n = Rn\u22121 V for all n \u2265 1. Finally, note that g n 6\u2208 V n for all n \u2265 1, because V n \u2286 V R\u2032\u2032 = J \u2032\u2032 ,\nand g n 6\u2208 J \u2032\u2032 for all n \u2265 1 since R\u2032\u2032 /J \u2032\u2032 is g-torsionfree. In conclusion, I = V R = RV is an ideal of R\nsuch that {1, g, g 2, . . . } form a k-basis for R/I. So I is a special ideal of R, and moreover R/I is a right\ng-torsionfree R-point module.\n(2) The calculation in (1) also shows that A = khV i = k + I. Clearly A is not right noetherian, since\nRA is infinitely generated, but RA embeds as a submodule of A by taking any 0 6= x \u2208 I and considering\nxR \u2286 I \u2286 A. Similarly, A is not left noetherian.\n(3) Note that J \u2032\u2032 \u2286 R\u2032 . This is because by part (1), we have J \u2032\u2032 = W (p)W (\u03c3 \u22122 (p))S1 R\u2032\u2032 , which is easily\nchecked to be contained in R\u2032 by moving point spaces (in fact, we even have W (p)W (\u03c3 \u22122 (p))S1 T1 = R2\u2032 .)\nSo J \u2032\u2032 \u2286 R\u2032 \u2229 R\u2032\u2032 . Since R\u2032\u2032 /J \u2032\u2032 is a line module, R\u2032\u2032 /J \u2032\u2032 is a point module, in particular each graded piece\nhas dimension 1. By considering vanishing conditions, it is easy to see that (R\u2032\u2032 \u2229 R\u2032 )n ( Rn\u2032\u2032 for n \u2265 1, and\nso this forces R\u2032\u2032 \u2229 R\u2032 /J \u2032\u2032 = k. Since (R\u2032\u2032 \u2229 R\u2032 )/J \u2032\u2032 is g-torsionfree, being an R-submodule of R\u2032\u2032 /J \u2032\u2032 , we\nconclude that (R\u2032\u2032 \u2229R\u2032 )/J \u2032\u2032 is a g-torsionfree point module, which must have {1, g, g 2, . . . } as a k-basis. Then\nthe natural map R/(J \u2032\u2032 \u2229R) \u2192 (R\u2032 \u2229R\u2032\u2032 )/J \u2032\u2032 is an isomorphism of R-modules. Clearly I = V R \u2286 V R\u2032\u2032 = J \u2032\u2032 .\nThus I \u2286 J \u2032\u2032 \u2229 R and so we have I = J \u2032\u2032 \u2229 R by Hilbert functions.\nNow it is straightforward to check that J \u2286 J \u2032\u2032 , as follows. If x \u2208 J, then R1\u2032 x \u2286 R. Choosing any\nz \u2208 R1\u2032\u2032 \\ R1\u2032 , we have R1\u2032 + kz = T1 and so T1 x = (R1\u2032 x + kzx) \u2286 R + R1\u2032\u2032 R \u2286 R\u2032\u2032 . Thus x \u2208 J \u2032\u2032 . So\nJ \u2286 J \u2032\u2032 \u2229 R = I.\nIt is known by the proof of part (1) that I = V R is generated in degree 1 as a right R-ideal. So I/J\nis a cyclic module, generated in degree 1, with the Hilbert series of a line module shifted by \u22121. Examine\nX = V J \u25e6 . By moving point spaces, it is easy to see that R1\u2032 V = V R1\u2032\u2032 . Thus X satisfies R1\u2032 X = R1\u2032 V J \u25e6 =\n39\n\n\fV R\u2032\u2032 J \u25e6 \u2286 V R \u2286 R. So X \u2286 J. This implies that J \u25e6 \u2286 r. ann(y), where 0 6= y \u2208 V /J1 is a generator of I/J.\nThus there is a surjection R/J \u25e6 [\u22121] \u2192 I/J. This is a surjection between R-modules with the same Hilbert\nfunction, so it is an isomorphism.\n(4) Consider the R-module R/(J \u2032 \u2229 R). This module is certainly g-torsionfree (being an R-submodule of\nthe line module R\u2032 /J \u2032 ). Moreover, by considering vanishing conditions one easily sees that R/J \u2032 \u2229 R has\nthe Hilbert series of a point module at the very smallest, as follows: since we showed that J \u2032\u2032 = V R\u2032\u2032 in\npart (1), an analogous argument gives that J \u2032 = J1\u2032 R\u2032 , where J1\u2032 = W (\u03c3 3 (p))W (\u03c3(p))S1 ; thus, for all n \u2265 0\nevery element of Jn\u2032 vanishes at \u03c3 3 (p), which is not true of every element of Rn . Then R/(J \u2032 \u2229 R) has the\nHilbert series of a line module at the very smallest. Now we have J \u25e6 \u2286 J \u2032 , by a completely analogous proof\nto the one showing J \u2286 J \u2032\u2032 in part (3) (just switch the roles of R\u2032 and R\u2032\u2032 .) Since R/J \u25e6 is a line module\nand J \u25e6 \u2286 (J \u2032 \u2229 R), we conclude that J \u25e6 = J \u2032 \u2229 R. Thus R/J \u25e6 = R/(J \u2032 \u2229 R) \u2192 R\u2032 /J \u2032 is an injection of line\nmodules and so is in fact an isomorphism.\nCombined with (3), this shows that L\u2032R is isomorphic to a shift of a submodule of R/J = L, so that\ne by definition.\nL\u2032R \u2208 Ce is in the exceptional category of the blowup R \u2286 R\u2032 . Then L\u2032R\u2032 \u2208 D\n\n\u0003\n\nHaving a divisor D which contains two points on the same \u03c3 3 -orbit is not the only situation in which one\n\nexpects the ring R(D) to have special ideals. Such ideals also occur when the points of D are not in general\nposition in P2 , for example if D is the sum of three collinear points, as follows.\nExample 11.3. Let 0 6= f \u2208 S1 , and let D = p + q + r be the hyperplane section of E where f \u2208 H0 (E, L)\nvanishes. Let R = R(D). Let V = f S2 , so that dimk V = 6. We have V = R, both being the set of sections\nof L3 vanishing along D. Since dimk R1 = 7, we have g 6\u2208 V and V + kg = R1 . Consider V 2 = f S2 f S2 . The\nspace S1 f S1 contains g by Lemma 4.6(3), and so f S2 f S2 \u2287 f S1 gS1 = V g. It then follows, similarly as in\nthe proof of part (1) of the preceding proposition, that I = RV = V R is a special ideal of R with V n = In\nand V n + kg n = Rn for all n \u2265 1. Moreover, since Sg is a completely prime ideal of S, it is easy to check\nthat g n 6\u2208 f S, so that g n 6\u2208 V n for all n \u2265 0. Thus R/I is a factor ring which is also a g-torsionfree point\nmodule.\n12. Subrings of S generated in degree 1\nIn this final section, we study the behavior of subrings of a generic Sklyanin algebra S which are generated\nin degree 1. Because dimk S1 = 3, it is not surprising that there are rather few possibilities. Thus we can\ngive a much more specific classification result than in the case of degree-3-generated algebras, but at the\nexpense of some picky calculations. Still, we offer this result as a step towards a general theory of subalgebras\ngenerated in an arbitrary degree of S. Throughout this section, let A = khV i, where 0 6= V ( S1 . Certainly\nif dimk V = 1, then A \u223c\n= k[z], and this case is both boring and does not have Qgr (A) 6= Qgr (S). So the\nonly case worth studying is dimk V = 2, and we will see in Theorem 12.2 below that the classification is a\ndichotomy depending on whether or not V is a point space.\n40\n\n\fThe major technical part of the work is contained in the next lemma. Though what A is equal to in large\ndegree follows easily from previous lemmas, in case V is not a point space, our method of proof in the next\ntheorem requires a more careful analysis of dimk An for small n.\nLemma 12.1. Let V \u2286 H0 (E, L) such that dimk V = 2 and V generates L, and let A = khV i \u2286 S, so that\nA = khV i \u2286 B = B(E, L, \u03c3).\n(1) A is equal to B in large degree.\n(2) A1 S1 = S2 = S1 A1 .\n(3) dimk A2 = 4 and dimk A3 \u2265 7.\nProof. Throughout the proof of this lemma, we identify A\u22642 with A\u22642 .\n(1) By Lemma 3.2(3), A is equal in large degree to some B(F, M, \u03c4 ). Here, there is a finite morphism of\nnonsingular elliptic curves \u03b8 : E \u2192 F ; 3 = deg L = (deg \u03b8)(deg M), where M is the sheaf on F generated\nby A1 ; and deg M \u2265 2. The only possibility is that \u03b8 is the identity, and A is equal in large degree to\nB = B(E, L, \u03c3).\n(2) This was actually already shown in the course of the proof of Lemma 3.1(1). Namely, since L 6\u223c\n= L\u03c3 ,\nthe argument there shows not only that the natural map\n\u03b8 : H0 (E, L) \u2297 H0 (E, L\u03c3 ) \u2192 H0 (E, L2 )\nis surjective, but that it is surjective even when restricted to V \u2297 H0 (E, L\u03c3 ) or H0 (E, L) \u2297 V \u03c3 .\n(3) Certainly dimk A2 \u2264 4. Choosing z \u2208 S1 \\ A1 , part (2) shows that (kz + A1 )A1 = S2 , and so\nzA1 + A2 = S2 . Since dimk S2 = 6, this forces dimk A2 = 4.\nNow we prove that dimk A3 \u2265 7 (we haven't tried to figure out whether the exact value of dimk A3 is\n7 or 8.) The idea is to show that for generic choice of a k-basis y, z for A1 , we have dimk zA2 \u2229 yS2 = 1.\nCertainly, then, A3 = yA2 + zA2 will have dimension at least 2(4) \u2212 1 = 7.\nSince V generates L, a basis for the sections in V determines a morphism \u03c6 : E \u2192 P(V \u2217 ) \u223c\n= P1 . The map\n\u03c6 is the composition of the embedding i : E \u2192 P(B1\u2217 ) \u223c\n= P2 with a projection map given by projection away\nfrom the point x \u2208 P(B1\u2217 ) determined by V , where x 6\u2208 i(E). Thus the hyperplane sections of \u03c6 are the\ndegree 3 divisors which are the intersections of lines in P2 through x with E. Let D be a Weil divisor such\nthat L \u223c\n= OE (D), and let |D| be the complete linear system of D. Let d \u2286 |D| be the (incomplete) linear\nsystem of hyperplane sections of \u03c6. Now suppose that A1 = ky + kz and zu = yv in S3 , with u \u2208 A2 , v \u2208 S2 .\nThen zu = yv in B3 . Now y vanishes along some divisor C \u2208 d and z does not vanish at any of the points in\nC, because lines through x in P2 are uniquely determined by any point in E they go through. So necessarily\nu vanishes along \u03c3(C), in other words u \u2208 H0 (E, I\u03c3(C) \u2297 L2 ) \u2229 A2 . We will show that for a generic choice of\ny (equivalently a generic choice of C \u2208 d), vanishing along \u03c3(C) presents 3 linearly independent conditions\nto sections in A2 . Then dimk H0 (E, I\u03c3(C) \u2297 L2 ) \u2229 A2 = 1, and completing y to a basis {y, z} we will conclude\nthat dimk zA2 \u2229 yS2 = 1 as needed.\n41\n\n\fWe want a more geometric interpretation for the sections in A2 . A basis for the sections in V \u03c3 \u2286 H0 (E, L\u03c3 )\ndetermines a map \u03c6\u2032 : E \u2192 P((V \u03c3 )\u2217 ) \u223c\n= P1 , where \u03c6\u2032 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c3. The sections in A2 \u2286 H0 (E, L2 ) determine\na map \u03b8 : E \u2192 P(A\u22172 ) \u223c\n= V \u2297k V \u03c3 by dimension count, the\n= P3 , and since we know that in fact A2 \u223c\nmap \u03b8 factors through the map \u03c1 = \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6\u2032 : E \u2192 P(V \u2217 ) \u00d7 P((V \u03c3 )\u2217 ) \u223c\n= P1 \u00d7 P1 ; in other words, \u03b8 is \u03c1\nfollowed by a Segre embedding. This allows us to interpret the linear system of hyperplane sections of \u03b8 as\n(1, 1)-hyperplane sections of \u03c1. Moreover, we claim that \u03c1 is generically one-to-one (and so birational onto\nits image). For we have \u03c6 = \u03c01 \u25e6 \u03c1, where \u03c01 is the first projection P1 \u00d7 P1 \u2192 P1 . Thus if d is the degree of\n\u03c1 : E \u2192 \u03c1(E) (the number of points in a generic fiber of this map), then d divides the degree of \u03c6, which is\n3. Moreover, d < 3, because no fiber of \u03c6 can also be a fiber of \u03c6\u2032 , given that D 6\u223c \u03c3 \u22121 (D). So d = 1.\nNow a generic C \u2208 d must consist of 3 distinct points; otherwise, every line in P2 through x will be tangent\nto E, and this sort of thing happens for plane curves rarely, and certainly not for an embedded elliptic curve\n[Ha, Theorem IV.3.9]. Since \u03c1 is also generically one-to-one, choosing a generic C \u2208 d, then \u03c1(\u03c3(C)) will\nconsist of 3 distinct points. Moreover, those three points will present 3 linearly independent conditions to\nsections of O(1, 1) on P1 \u00d7 P1 , unless \u03c1(\u03c3(C)) lies entirely on a line in one of the two rulings. But this would\nhappen only if \u03c3(C) \u2208 d or \u03c3 2 (C) \u2208 d, both of which are impossible. Thus for a generic choice of C \u2208 d,\n\u03c3(C) presents 3 linearly independent conditions to the sections of A2 , as required.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 12.2. Let V \u2286 S1 with dimk V = 2 and let A = khV i.\n(1) If V = W (p) is a point space, then A(3) = R(D), where D = p + \u03c3 \u22121 (p) + \u03c3 \u22122 (p). In this case,\nt2 + 1\n. In particular, A satisfies Hypothesis 6.1 and thus all of\nA \u2229 Sg = Ag and hA (t) =\n(1 \u2212 t)2 (1 \u2212 t3 )\nthe theorems in Section 6.\n(2) If V is not a point space, then A is equal to S in all large degrees.\nProof. (1). To show that A(3) = R(D), it suffices to show that V 3 = R(D)1 = {x \u2208 S3 |x \u2208 H0 (E, ID \u2297 L3 )}.\nClearly V 3 = R(D)1 , using Lemma 3.1, so it suffices to show that g \u2208 V 3 . This is shown in Lemma 4.6(2).\nNote that A = B(E, N , \u03c3), where N = Ip \u2297 L, by Lemma 3.1. Consider N (i) = {x \u2208 S|xg i \u2208 A} for\n(i)\n\neach i \u2265 0. Obviously A \u2286 N (i) . Moreover, since R(D) \u2229 T g i = R(D)g i , we have N3n = A3n for all\nn \u2265 0. Consider A \u2286 N (i) \u2286 S. Since (N (i) /A)3n = 0 for all n \u2265 0, and A is generated in degree 1, we\nsee that N\n\n(i)\n\n/A is a direct limit of graded A-modules which are finite-dimensional over k. On the other\n\nhand, it is clear since Qgr (R(D)) = Qgr (T ) that Qgr (A) = Qgr (S), so that A \u2286 N (i) is an essential extension\nof right A-modules. Also, Ext1A (k, A) = 0, since A is Cohen-Macaulay by Proposition 2.2(4). This forces\nN (i) = A for each i. In other words, N (i) \u2286 A + Sg. Now note that N (1) \u2286 A + Sg 0 = S, and suppose that\nN (1) \u2286 A + Sg i for some i \u2265 0. Then for x \u2208 N (1) , writing x = a + sg i with a \u2208 A, s \u2208 S, we see that\nxg = ag + sg i+1 \u2208 A and so s \u2208 N (i+1) . Since N (i+1) \u2286 A + Sg, we have x \u2208 A + Sg i+1 , so N (1) \u2286 A + Sg i+1 .\nT\nBy induction on i, N (1) \u2286 i\u22650 A + Sg i = A, so A \u2229 Sg = Ag. The Hilbert series follows immediately since\nt2 + 1\n.\nhA (t) =\n(1 \u2212 t)2\n42\n\n\f(2) By Lemma 12.1(1), we have that A is equal to S in large degree. We wish to apply Proposition 7.6(1).\nFor this we need to check the hypotheses of that proposition, namely that A \u2286 S is a finite extension, that\nQgr (A) = Qgr (S), and that (A\u2229Sg)/(A\u2229Sg 2 ) 6= 0. Supposing we prove these things, then Proposition 7.6(1)\nwill show that A contains a special ideal of S. But S has no such ideals except those of finite-k-codimension,\nby Lemma 10.3. Thus A will then equal S in large degree, as required.\nThe remaining needed facts follow from the other parts of Lemma 12.1. First, the proof of Lemma 12.1(3)\nshows that S2 = zA1 + A2 = A1 z + A2 where z \u2208 S1 \\ A1 . Then by the graded Nakayama lemma,\nS = A + zA = Az + A. So A \u2286 S is a finite extension. We also have from Lemma 12.1(3) that dimk A2 = 4,\nas well as the rather hard-earned estimate dimk A3 \u2265 7. Since S3 = zA2 +A3 = A2 z +A3 , with dimk S3 = 10,\nthis implies that (zA \u2229 A)3 6= 0. Choose 0 6= x \u2208 A2 such that zx \u2208 A3 . Since g \u2208 S3 = A2 z + A3 , we have\ngx \u2208 A2 zx + A3 x \u2286 A5 . Thus 0 6= gx \u2208 (A \u2229 Sg) \\ (A \u2229 Sg 2 ), so that (A \u2229 Sg)/(A \u2229 Sg 2 ) 6= 0. Also, since\nwe have seen that zA \u2229 A 6= 0, then z \u2208 Qgr (A). So S1 \u2286 Qgr (A), and thus Qgr (S) = Qgr (A). All of the\nhypotheses of Proposition 7.6(1) are now verified, and we are done.\n\n\u0003\n\nAs a prelude to future work, we close with the following example of a subring of S generated in degree 2.\nIt points to a new issue that arises in trying to understand algebras generated in that degree, and presumably\nall other degrees; degrees 1 and 3 were special because they divide the degree of the central element in S.\nExample 12.3. Let p \u2208 E be given, and let A = khV i \u2286 S (2) , where V = W (p)S1 \u2286 S2 is the set of all\nsections of S2 \u223c\n= B(E, L2 ) vanishing along p. Since we know from the theorems in this paper that both the\n\u223c R(p) and the degree-1-generated algebra khW (p)i are very nice\ndegree-3 generated algebra khW (p)S2 i =\nrings, we might hope A is similarly good.\nNow V 2 = W (p)S1 W (p)S1 = S1 W (\u03c3(p))W (p)S1 \u2287 S1 g by Lemma 4.6(1). Then V 3 \u2287 V S1 g and\nV 3 \u2287 S1 gV = S1 V g. Since it is easy to prove that V S1 + S1 V = S3 , we have V 3 \u2287 S3 g. An similar inductive\nL\nargument shows that i\u22650 S(2i+1) g \u2286 A. We claim then that A is not left noetherian. Indeed, if A were left\nL\nnoetherian, then S \u2032 = i\u22650 S2i+1 would be a finitely generated left A-module, since S \u2032 \u223c\n= S \u2032 g (as ungraded\nL\nmodules) and S \u2032 g \u2286 A. But then A S \u2032 would be finitely generated, where S \u2032 = i\u22650 H0 (E, L2i+1 ), and by the\ngraded Nakayama lemma, we would have to have dimk S \u2032 /(A\u22651 S \u2032 ) < \u221e. However, since A = B(E, N , \u03c3 2 )\nL\nwith N = Ip \u2297 L2 , we have (A\u22651 S \u2032 ) \u2286 i\u22650 H0 (E, Ip \u2297 L2i+1 ) for all i \u2265 0, from which it is clear that\n\ndimk S \u2032 /(A\u22651 S \u2032 ) = \u221e.\n\nReferences\n[Aj1]\n\nKaushal Ajitabh, Modules over elliptic algebras and quantum planes, Proc.
