To gain experience\nin performing research the group gave us the opportunity to work in their laboratory. Inspired by\nan article of Buchanan et al. we have chosen the subject 'recognizing samples via their speckle\npattern'. We experienced the given opportunities in the lab and the freedom of choosing our own\nassignment as very challenging and motivating, for this we would like to thank the coordinator of\nthe course, Allard Mosk.\nIn our every day work we enjoyed being part of the group. We have attended the group\nmeetings which gave us an impression of the research performed in the group. These meetings\nwere also used to present our results; which taught us how to present results in a better way.\nWithin the group our two fellow students Ramy El-Dardiry and Sanli Faez were of great\nimportance for the atmosphere in which we worked. Both students are very motivated in their\nwork and they had many good ideas, this inspired us in our project.\nKaren van der Molen and Cock Harteveld have guided us on a daily basis. Cock was always\navailable for practical or technical questions. Besides this, he often took a glance at our setup and\ngave us many good suggestions on improving it. Karen has always been interested in the progress\nof our work. We experienced her critical attitude as very motivating. Furthermore she showed us\nhow everyday scientific work goes. In the ups and downs of the research her support was very\nwelcome.\n\nThank you all, it was a great pleasure,\nElbert and Frerik\n\n1\n\n\fContents\nAbstract\n\n0\n\nPreface\n\n1\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\n2\n\nTheory\n\n4\n\n2.1\n\nSpeckles..........................................................................................................................................4\n\n2.2\n\nGaussian beam optics......................................................................................................................4\n\n2.3\n\nAnalyses of changes in the speckle pattern........................................................................................5\n\n2.4\n\nRecognition criterion ........................................................................................................................8\n\n3\n\nExperimental apparatus\n\n10\n\n4\n\nResults\n\n12\n\n4.1\n\nThe measurements on the line and spot ..........................................................................................12\n\n4.2\n\nChanges in the setup for successful recognition.................................................................................14\n\n4.3\n\nResults of the recognition attempt ...................................................................................................15\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\n16\n\n6\n\nRecommendations\n\n17\n\n7\n\nReferences\n\n18\n\nAppendix A: Order-of-Magnitude estimation of a speckle\n\n19\n\nAppendix B: Diffraction limited size of the spot\n\n20\n\nAppendix C: Diffraction limited size of the line\n\n21\n\nAppendix D: Correlations\n\n22\n\n2\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn our world forgery is timeless; ever since money and important documents exist falsifications are\nmade. Many efforts have been done to distinguish these falsifications from real items. Buchanan\net al. [1] have shown that paper samples can be distinguished by their unique internal structure.\nThis structure can be visualized by illuminating the paper sample, this yields a unique speckle\npattern which can be measured and stored. When these measurements are compared to other\nmeasurements, samples can be distinguished. Reproducibility of the speckle pattern is an\nimportant issue when using the pattern to distinguish samples. A speckle pattern is reproducible\nwhen the random structure of the paper does not change in time. Furthermore it is important that\nthe speckle pattern can be measured in a reproducible way.\nBuchanan et al. have distinguished 500 paper samples by their speckle pattern. The\nrecognition is even possible after several ways of rough handling, such as baking it in an oven,\nsoaking and heavily screwing the sample. Buchanan et al. measured the speckle pattern of the\nreflected light with a scanning mechanism, a laser line and four photo detectors. The experiments\ndescribed in this report omit the scanning mechanism and the photodiodes. One static Charge\nCoupled Device (CCD) was used to measure the speckle pattern of the reflected light. A large\ncircular spot was used to create a speckle pattern for the recognition attempt presented in this\nreport. Measurements to find advantages of using a line instead of a spot were performed too.\nIn this report we first describe the theoretical aspects of our experiments: In chapter 2 an\nestimation of the speckle size, Gaussian beam theory, an analysis of the properties of speckle and\nthe used recognition criterion are presented. A discussion of the used recognition criterion we\nconcludes the chapter. In the third chapter the setup on which all measurements were performed\nwill be presented. The chapter 'Results' will present all final results, and discusses the performed\nmeasurements. Plots on sample movements, distance variations and the angular sensitivity are\npresented. From these measurements we will conclude that the use of a line has no significant\nadvantages for the recognition of samples. A presentation of the recognition of the samples\nconcludes this chapter. In the last two chapters the conclusions and recommendations will be\ngiven.\n\n3\n\n\f2 Theory\nThis chapter deals with a few concepts that are used throughout the report. In section 2.1 the\norigin of speckles is discussed together with an estimation of the average size of speckles. Section\n2.2 discusses Gaussian beam optics which is necessary for creating a spot and a line of a certain\nsize. In section 2.3 the behavior of the speckles is discussed when a degree of freedom is changed.\nWe conclude the chapter with a description of our recognition criterion.\n\n2.1 Speckles\nWhen highly coherent light falls onto an object and the scattered light is projected onto a screen,\nthe screen is speckled with bright and dark regions. These speckles are caused by rays scattering\nfrom different parts of the illuminated area. At the screen these rays have a different optical path\nlength; therefore the rays interfere and result in speckles, as shown in Figure 2.1. In transmission\nspeckles will be found too, in this case the phase shift between the rays arises from several\nscattering events within the sample.\n\nFigure 2.1: Rays reflect from different parts of the surface. The surface is\noptically rough thus the rays have a different optical path length at the\nobservation point and interference will give bright and dark regions, so-called\nspeckles.\n\nThe relation between the illuminated part of the sample and the average size \u03c3 of the\nresulting speckles can be estimated by\n\n\u03c3\u2248\n\n2\u03bb L\n,\nD\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the laser beam, L the distance from the sample to the screen and D\nthe length of the illuminated part of the sample. In Appendix A the derivation of this order-ofmagnitude estimation for the speckle size is given. Equation (2.1) shows that when a larger area is\nilluminated the resulting speckles will shrink. The equation also shows that a sample lit by a\nhorizontally aligned laser line will have a speckle pattern consisting of vertically aligned lines.\nIncreasing the power of the light source increases the spread in intensity of the speckles\nsince the highest measured intensity increases while the minimum remains zero.\n\n2.2 Gaussian beam optics\nThe electromagnetic field modes inside most optical laser cavities can be described mathematically\nby TEMmn (Transverse Electric and Magnetic) modes, where m and n represent the order of the\n\n4\n\n\fmodes perpendicular to the propagation direction. The fundamental mode (m=n=0) has a Gaussian\nintensity profile. The HeNe laser that will be used is considered to be an ideal TEM00 mode [3, 4];\ntherefore Gaussian beam optics will be discussed now.\nDue to the fact that no real laser beam can be infinite in size, diffraction causes beams to\nspread transversely as they propagate. The radius of a Gaussian beam w, defined as the distance at\nwhich the intensity drops to e-2 times the maximal axial value, spreads in accordance to\n1/ 2\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb \u03bb z \uf8f62 \uf8f9\n\uf8fa\nw( z ) = w0 \uf8ef1 + \uf8ec\n2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 \uf8ed \u03c0 w0 \uf8f8 \uf8fa\uf8fb\n\n,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere w0 is the minimal radius of the beam, the so-called beam waist, which is depicted in Figure\n2.2. The wavelength is given by \u03bb. The distance with respect to the beam waist is given by z.\n\nFigure 2.2: Growth in beam diameter as a function of distance from the beam\nwaist.\n\nA practical measure for the divergence is the distance z R with respect to the focus. At z R the\ncross-sectional area of the beam is doubled. Using equation (2.2) and setting w(z) equal to\n\u221a2* w0 one can solve this for z R :\n\nzR =\n\n\u03c0 w02\n.\n\u03bb\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe distance z R is widely known as the Rayleigh range and z R can be considered as a measure\nfor the distance at which the beam waist remains rather constant, and in focus.\n\n2.3 Analyses of changes in the speckle pattern\nRecognizing a sample using the speckle pattern of two different measurements requires\nthat the sample is mounted at the same place with certain accuracy. In this section an analysis is\ngiven of the changes in the speckle pattern caused by changing a degree of freedom in the setup.\nThe sideward (x), displacement of the sample, the distance between sample and CCD (r) and the\nangular displacement (\u03b8) of the CCD are varied, see Figure 2.3.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 2.3: The three discussed degrees of freedom of the sample with respect to\nthe incoming light and the CCD: x, r and \u03b8.\n\n2.3.1 Displacement in x-direction\nWhen the sample is slightly shifted in x-direction the illuminated part of the sample is changed\nbut the speckle patterns before and after movement will be correlated. The expect that the\ncorrelation is caused by the area O that is enlightened in both cases, as depicted in Figure 2.4 on\nthe next page, because the number of rays which have the same phase in both measurements is\nproportional to O.\nThe area O will now be calculated as a function of the displacement x d . The spot is\nparameterized as an ellipsoid:\n\nx2 y 2\n+\n= 1,\na 2 b2\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere 2*a is the short axis and 2*b the long axis of the spot. If the second ellipsoid is moved a\ndistance x d , as one can seen in Figure 2.4, the area O can be calculated by integrating 2*y(x)*dx\nfrom x d /2 to a and multiply this by 2:\na\n\nO = 2 \u222b 2 y ( x)dx,\nxd\n\n2\n\na\n\n=2\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ebx\uf8f6\n2\n\u222bx (2b ) \uf8ec\uf8ec1 \u2212 \uf8ec\uf8ed a \uf8f7\uf8f8\nd\n\n2\n\n\uf8ed\n\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7dx ,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n2\n2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb a \uf8f6\n1 \uf8eb xd \uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u22121 \uf8eb x d \uf8f6\n= ab\uf8ec \u03c0 \u2212 sin \uf8ec \uf8f7 \u2212 \uf8ec \uf8f7 4\uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2212 1 \uf8f7.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 2a \uf8f8 2 \uf8ed a \uf8f8\n\uf8ed xd \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\n(2.7)\n\nEquation 2.7 shows that the area O remains constant when ab and x d /a remain the same. When\n\nthe area A of a beam ( A = \u03c0ab ) is kept constant the overlapping area between two measurements\nand thus the correlation will be equal for equal values of x d /a.\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 2.4: Two partially overlapping ellipsoids with short axis 2*a and long axis\n2*b. The red surface is equal to the blue surface. To calculate the overlap between\nthe two ellipsoids one can integrate only the blue surface and multiply this by 2.\n\n2.3.2\n\nVariation in r-direction\n\nChanging the distance between the sample and the screen will modify the speckle pattern on the\nscreen. Two effects occur, first the path lengths of the rays change and second the speckles change\nin size according to formula 2.1.\nThe effect of the change in the path lengths is considered by estimating the distance \u03b4r one\ncan move the sample without changing the speckle pattern, see also Figure 2.5. At point D1 the\nwaves from point P interfere constructively with the waves from O and the waves from P' with\nthose from O', etc. When the screen is moved from r to r + \u03b4r one can estimate the change in path\nlength difference \u2206 between PD1 and OD1 :\n\n\u2202 (OD1 \u2212 PD1 )\n\u03b4r ,\n\u2202r\n\uf8f6\nd2\n\u2202 \uf8eb\n= \uf8ecr \u2212\n+ r 2 \uf8f7\u03b4r ,\n\uf8f7\n2\n\u2202r \uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\n\u2206 =\n\n\u2248\n\n\uf8eb\n\u2202 \uf8eb\nd 2 \uf8f6\uf8f6\n\uf8ec r \u2212 r \uf8ec1 + 2 \uf8f7 \uf8f7\u03b4r ,\n\uf8ec 4r \uf8f7 \uf8f7\n\u2202r \uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\uf8f8\n\nd2\n= 2 \u03b4r.\n4r\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe bright spot at point D2 will be a dark spot if one sets the change in path length difference \u2206\nequal to \u03bb/2:\n\n\u03bb\n\n2\n\n=\u2206\n\nd2\n\u03b4r\n4r 2\n2\u03bbr 2\n\u03b4r \u2248 2 .\nd\n\u2248\n\n(2.9)\n\nIf one assumes a spot diameter d in the order of a few 100 \u03bcm, a wavelength \u03bb of 632.8 nm\nand a distance r of 10 cm, the distance \u03b4r is allowed to be in the order of a meter in r-direction.\n\n7\n\n\f\u03b4r\nr\n\nFigure 2.5: A schematic representation for an order of magnitude estimation of the\ndistance one can move the screen such that the speckle patterns are no longer\ncorrelated.\n\nThe effect of the magnification of speckles is illustrated in Figure 2.6. Due to the large\nmagnification of the pattern the correlation reduces. From (2.1) it is shown that speckles, and\ntherefore the speckle pattern, are magnified when the distance r is increased. The effect is\nnegligible when the change in distance is negligible to the distance r.\n\nFigure 2.6: The loss of correlation due to the magnification of the speckle pattern\nwhen the distance r is increased. The speckles are represented by circles and the\nred speckles represent the image as captured by the CCD at a smaller distance\nthan the black ones.\n\n2.3.3 Radial displacement\nPlacing the sample under a different angle with respect to the recording screen results in a\ndifferent speckle pattern at the screen. A small misalignment will cause the CCD to record a\ndifferent part of the speckle pattern. One can find the angle \u03b8 when the CCD, with a width d,\nrecords a complete new part of the speckle pattern:\n\n\uf8ebd \uf8f6\n\uf8edr\uf8f8\n\n\u03b8 = tan \u22121 \uf8ec \uf8f7,\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere r is the distance between the sample and the recording screen. At angles larger than \u03b8 there\nis no correlation expected.\n\n2.4 Recognition criterion\nSamples will be recognized by analyzing the correlation function (Appendix D) of two\nmeasurements. The correlation functions consist of several peaks which can originate from either\na correspondence of the internal structure of the samples or from coincidently coinciding speckles\n\n8\n\n\f(CCS) in both measurements. From the probability that a peak represents CCS one can judge\nwhether a sample is recognized.\nTo calculate the probability of a peak representing CCS, Gaussian statistics will be used.\nThe use of Gaussian statistics is justified when events are caused additively and independently, we\ndo not know whether this is the case for correlation functions of speckle patterns. Some further\nresearch on this topic is required.\nThe Gaussian probability distribution is defined as\n\u2212\n1\nP( x ) =\ne\n\u03c3 2\u03c0\n\n( x \u2212 \u03bc )2\n2\u03c3 2\n\n,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the average and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. To determine whether a peak represents\nCCS the cumulative distribution is used. The probability that there exists a peak n larger than a\nvalue a is given by:\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\n1\nP(n \u2265 a ) = \u222b\ne\na \u03c3 2\u03c0\n\n( x \u2212 \u03bc )2\n2\u03c3 2\n\ndx.\n\n(2.12)\n\nWhen this probability is negligible one can state that the sample is recognized. The probability of\nfinding a peak larger than a depends on the total number of peaks. Assuming that all 512*512\npixels are independent and N correlations are done, the probability of finding a peak larger than a\nis:\n\nP (n \u2265 a) \u22c5 N \u22c5 512 \u22c5 512 .\n\n(2.13)\n\n.\nWe define the number of correlations that can be performed before finding a second peak caused\nby CCS as the uniqueness U:\n\nU=\n\n1\n.\n512 \u22c5 512 \u22c5 P(n \u2265 a)\n\n(2.14)\n\nIn our research an attempt to distinguish 10 samples will done, this yields 100 correlations. A ratio\nof 6.5 between the correlation peak and the standard deviation of the correlation is used,\ncorresponding to a uniqueness of 105. Because 100 correlations will be made, there is a probability\nof 99.9 % that one recognizes the sample properly.\nAlthough speckles are build up out of several pixels, which makes some pixels correlated, this\nanalysis assumes the pixels to be independent. The correlation between the pixels can be taken\ninto account by stating that the number of speckles is the number of independent channels. This\napproach does not take the position of the speckles into account, which is measurable with an\naccuracy of the pixel size. Omitting this position effect would overestimate the uniqueness factor\nwhereas our approach underestimates it. How to deal with this problem requires some further\nresearch. A simple solution could be to match the speckle size with the pixel size. This solution\nmight lead to experimental problems because the speckles vary in size.\nBesides that the pixels are correlated due to the fact that they represent a speckle together,\nthe pixels are always correlated because the CCD is not ideal.\n\n9\n\n\f3 Experimental apparatus\nBecause both a line and a spot will be used in the experiments, the setup (see Figure 3) is able to\nswitch easily between illumination by a line and a spot. The light goes either along the path\ndepicted by the dotted line or along the path depicted by the dashed line. The first results in an\ncircular spot and the second in a elliptical spot. One can switch from one configuration to another\nby turning both flipping mirrors.\nThe laser light is scattered by the sample and collected by the CCD[5]. The CCD is mounted\non a rotational arm (accuracy 1*10-2 \u030a). The distance r between the CCD and the sample can be\nvaried (accuracy 0.5mm). The sample is held in a standard clip-type filter holder. This sample\nholder is connected to the translational stage via screws which allows one to remount the holder\nwithin an error of 0.5 mm and an error of 0.5o in the angle under which the light is reflected.\nOnce the sample holder is mounted on the translational stage it can moved along the dotted line\nwith 1 \u03bcm accuracy.\nHeNe laser\n\nLens 4\n(Plano convex)\nFlipping\nMirror\n\nCCD\n\nMirror\n\nScattered Light\n\nLens 1\n(Plano concave)\nRotating arm\nLens 2\n(Plano convex)\n\nDiaphragm\n\nMirror\nLens 3\n(Cylindrical\nPlano convex)\n\nFlipping\nMirror\n\nSample\n\nFigure 3.1: A schematic representation of the setup. Lens 1 and lens 2 magnify the beam. Lens 3\nfocuses the beam to a line on the sample. Lens 4 is used to create a circular spot by focusing the\nincoming beam onto the sample. The CCD is mounted on a rotational arm allowing measurements of\nthe speckle pattern under different angles and distances.\n\nIn the setup a plano convex lens (lens 4) with a focal distance of 200 mm was used to focus\nthe HeNe laser[6] beam to a round spot of 365 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm diameter. As shown in Appendix B this is\n3.35 \u00b1 0.08 times the diffraction limit.\nA spot of 1.93 \u00b1 0.01mm was created by collimating the light with two lenses (lens 1 and\nlens 2) and using a diaphragm. This spot was focused with a cylindrical lens (lens 3) with a focal\nlength of 60 mm to an elliptical spot of 69 \u00b1 1 \u03bcm short axis. The length of the line is 1.65 \u00b1 0.02\ntimes the diffraction limit and the width is 3.35 \u00b1 0.08 times the diffraction limit (see appendix C).\nEspecially the that fact the large side of the line meets the diffraction limit better was expected.\nOne has to note that the diaphragm used to create a line introduces and extra loss in intensity and\nchanges the beam profile. The area of both the elliptical beam and spot are (1.07 \u00b1 0.03)*105 \u03bcm2,\nthe importance of this has been stressed in 2.3.1.\n\n10\n\n\fWe used plain white paper samples which were available in the lab. Unfortunately no\nspecifications about these samples were available. One of the samples was measured to be 42.65 \u00b1\n0.05 mm by 99.70 \u00b1 0.05 mm and 0.40 \u00b1 0.05 mm thick, its weight was 1.1982 \u00b1 0.0005 g. Thus the\npaper was 281.8 \u00b1 0.6 g/m2. All the samples were made of the same kind of paper.\n\n11\n\n\f4 Results\nIn this chapter the final results will be presented in some plots. In the first paragraph the effect of\na displacement of the sample in x-direction, the sensitivity to a variation in the r-direction and\nmeasurements on the angular dependence will be presented and discussed. These measurements\nwere done for both the line and the spot.\nThe recommendations which followed from these measurements are described in\nparagraph 4.2. Some parameters of the setup were adjusted for the recognition attempt. The\nsensitivity to a displacement in x-direction was measured in this new configuration.\nFor the recognition attempt the new configuration was used, the results of this attempt are\ndiscussed in paragraph 4.3. In this paragraph it is also shown that samples can be recognized with\nhigh uniqueness factors, enabling industrial applications.\n\n4.1 The measurements on the line and spot\nIn this section the sensitivity of the speckle pattern to displacements in x, r and \u03b8 direction will be\ndiscussed and compared to the analyses in chapter 2.\n\n4.1.1 Displacement in x-direction\nIn Figure 4.1 the results of the displacement measurement of the 365 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm spot are shown. All\nmeasurements of the series in the range of 0 \u03bcm to 280 \u03bcm (20 \u03bcm steps) were correlated to the\nmeasurements at a displacement of 0 \u03bcm, 40 \u03bcm, 120 \u03bcm, 240 \u03bcm and 280 \u03bcm of the same series.\nThis resulted in two dimensional correlation functions C(x,y) of which both the peak value and\nthe standard deviation were calculated. Of all correlation functions there are five autocorrelation\nfunctions, the 'peak value to standard deviation'-ratios of these functions are plotted at zero\ndisplacement.\n\nFigure 4.1: The sensitivity of the speckle\npattern to a variation in the x-direction. The\nspeckle is caused by a circular spot of 365 \u03bcm.\nIn the legend one can see to what\nmeasurement the shown measurements are\ncorrelated.\n\nFigure 4.2: The sensitivity of the speckle\npattern to a variation in the x-direction. The\nspeckle is caused by a line. In the legend one\ncan see to which measurement the shown\nmeasurements are correlated.\n\nSince a 'peak value to standard deviation'-ratio of 6.5 is a good measure for recognition, the\nsample can be displaced over a distance of minimum 200 \u00b1 10 \u03bcm if one uses the spot.\nFor the line the approach was similar, the results are plotted in Figure 4.2. The\nmeasurement series were from 0 \u03bcm to 80 \u03bcm (5 \u03bcm steps) and series were correlated to the\nmeasurements at 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 \u03bcm.\nFigure 4.2 shows that the line is more sensitive to changes in x-direction, even when it is\nconsidered relative to the spot's width. The sample can be moved 54 \u00b1 1 % of the spots diameter,\n\n12\n\n\fwhereas the sample can only be moved 25 \u00b1 5 % relative to the lines width. This contradicts the\nanalysis in paragraph 2.3.1 for unknown reasons.\nThese measurements indicate that when a spot is larger the maximum allowed\ndisplacement in x-direction, when measured relative to the spot size, is larger too. Since our\nsystem can easily produce a 2.62 \u00b1 0.02 mm spot it is recommended to use this spot for the\nrecognition attempt.\n\n4.1.2 Variation CCD-sample distance\nThe influence of a variation of the distance between the CCD and the sample (r) was subjected to\nresearch at distances of 5.5, 17.6 and 36.7 cm between sample and CCD. We varied the distance r\nwith steps of 1 mm. Because the sample can be replaced with 0.5 mm accuracy the variations in\nthe speckle pattern due to a variation in distance can be neglected when the system is insensitive\nto 1 mm variations.\nIn Figure 4.3 and 4.4 the 'peak value to standard deviation'-ratio is plotted as a function of\nthe displacement in r-direction. Three series were performed, namely at 5.4 cm, 17.5 cm and 32.6\ncm. For the measurements shown in figure 4.3 a spot was used and for the measurements in Figure\n4.4 a line.\nThe results in Figure 4.3 show that the system is indeed less sensitive to changes in rdirection when the distance between CCD and sample is large. In case of the spot the 'peak value\nto standard deviation'-ratio remains constant and is sufficient for recognition at a distance of 17.5\ncm.\nRemarkably, the 'peak value to standard deviation'-ratio is very low when the sample is\nplaced at 17.5 cm and 32.6 cm. The ratio is low due to the broad correlation peak which\ncontributes significantly to the standard deviation of the correlation. The wide correlation peak is\ncaused by the large speckles.\nTo reduce the speckles in size either the spot has to be increased or the speckles have to be\nfocused. In our current setup the spot size can be increased by a factor of 7.2 to 2.62 \u00b1 0.02 mm. If\nthis spot is used at 30 cm, this will be comparable to measuring at 4.2 cm but with the advantage\nof lower sensitivity to changes in r-direction.\n\nFigure 4.3: In this plot the distance dependence of\nthe spot is shown. At larger distances the 'peak value\nto standard deviation'-ratio is low, due to the large\nspeckles. At 17.5 cm the correlation remains constant\nand sufficient for recognition. At 32.6 cm the\ncorrelation is too low due to the large speckles\n\nFigure 4.4: In this plot the distance dependence is of\nthe line is shown. At larger distances the 'peak\nvalue to standard deviation'-ratio is low, due to the\nlarge speckles.\n\n13\n\n\f4.1.3 Dependence CCD-Sample angle\nThe angular dependence was measured by varying the angle \u03b8(see figure 2.3) of the CCD with\nrespect to the sample. A distance of 10.0 \u00b1 0.1 cm was used and the CCD was moved with 0.5 o\nsteps. All measurements of this series have been correlated to the measurement at 0o and the result\nis shown in Figure 4.5. According to our criterion there was no correlation at 3.3 \u00b1 0.3o which\ncorresponds to a movement of 5.8 \u00b1 0.5 mm. It was expected that the correlation would be lost at\n6.9 mm, the width of the CCD. We expect there is a correlation between 5.8 \u00b1 0.5 mm and 6.9\nmm, but this correlation is probably so small that it can not be distinguished from peaks caused by\nCCS.\n\nFigure 4.5: In this plot the angular dependence can be seen. As expected the plot\nis linear. At an angle of 3.3 \u00b1 0.3 there is no significant correlation left.\n\nFurthermore the plot shows that with a line we measure a better peak to standard deviation\nratio, the difference is 30 times the standard deviation. This phenomenon can be seen in Figures\n4.1 and 4.2 as well, where the difference between the line and the spot is 15 times the standard\ndeviation.\nThis phenomenon might be explained by the loss in intensity at the diaphragm as discussed\nin paragraph 2.1, but it requires some further research.\n\n4.2 Changes in the setup for successful recognition\nIn the former paragraphs two recommendations were done for the recognition measurement, first\nto increase the distance r to 30 cm and second to use a larger spot. Before the recognition attempt,\nit was checked whether the larger distance does not change the sensitivity to displacements in the\nx-direction. Measurements on the large spot of 2.62 \u00b1 0.02 mm at a distance of 30 cm were\nperformed. The minimum displacement which would obtain sufficient correlation is 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 mm.\n\nFigure: 4.6: The sensitivity of the speckle pattern to a variation in the position.\nThe speckle is caused by a spot of 2.62 \u00b1 0.02 mm and measured at a distance of\n30 cm.\n\n14\n\n\fRemarkably, the possible movement relative to the spot size is less for the larger spot.\nnamely 35 \u00b1 4 % of the spot's width instead of 54 \u00b1 1 % . From Figures 4.1 and 4.2 it was expected\nthat the percentage would increase when the spot size was increased. Since both the spot size and\nthe distance r were increased we conclude the distance influences the sensitivity in x-direction.\n\n4.3 Results of the recognition attempt\nWith the adjusted setup a recognition attempt was performed. Ten samples were placed in a\nholder and their speckle patterns were measured. The samples were removed from the\ntranslational stage together with the holder. The samples were stored in the holder for thirty\nminutes in normal laboratory conditions\nThe first measurement of sample X was correlated with all measurements of the second\nseries. The correlation with the highest 'peak value to standard deviation'-ratio was selected.\nWhen this was indeed the correlation with the second measurement of sample X, and the 'peak\nvalue to standard deviation'-ratio was larger than 6.5, the sample is considered recognized. This\nprocedure was done for all measurements of the first series. In Figure 4.7 it is shown that 5\nsamples have been recognized.\n\nFigure 4.7: The recognition of five out of ten samples. This plot shows the\npotential of our setup, since very high uniqueness factor have been obtained.\n\nIt is interesting to see that the 'peak value to standard deviation'-ratios differ very\nsignificantly. Most ratios will not be sufficient for recognizing large numbers of samples.\nBuchanan et al. used a criterion which corresponds to a ratio of approximately 20 for their\nexperiment with 500 samples. All samples which could not be recognized have a peak of\napproximately 5 times the standard deviation, as expected.\nSample 8 is recognized with a 'peak value to standard deviation'-ratio of 32. The value of\n32 indicates that the measurements can be done more precise since Figure 4.6 shows that the\nmaximum possible ratio is 60 and that a ratio of 30 corresponds to a misplacement of 0.5 mm. The\nfact that the maximum ratio is reduced strongly indicates that the sample holder needs to be\nimproved.\nEspecially the angle at which the sample is placed was quite critical because the distance\nbetween sample and CCD was large. The accuracy in x-direction for placing the sample holder was\nprobably problematic too; the accuracy of replacing the sample holder was estimated at 0.5mm. As\nshown in figure 4.3, the correlation remains constant over a distance r for more than 2 mm and\ntherefore variation in r-direction is not likely to cause problems.\n\n15\n\n\f5 Conclusion\nIn this report the reproducibility of a speckle pattern caused by a line and a spot have been\ncompared. The use of a line always results in a better 'peak value to standard deviation'-ratio.\nRecognition of 5 out of 10 samples was achieved by using a large spot and a CCD. In our opinion\nthis setup has the potential of distinguishing large numbers of samples.\nIt was shown that a line is more sensitive to changes in x-direction. The sample can be\nmoved 54 \u00b1 1 % of the spots diameter, whereas the sample can be moved only 25 \u00b1 5 % relative to\nthe lines width. This result contradicts the expectation that the sensitivity to a relative movement\nis independent of beam shape.\nThe measurements on the distance between the CCD and the sample have shown that it is\npreferential to work at a large distance, under the condition that the speckles are small enough.\nThe behavior of the angular dependence appears to be the same in the case of the line and\nthe spot. We found that only the area of the CCD is limiting. At an angle of 3.3 \u00b1 0.3o there is no\nsignificant correlation left. This is the point where the chip is moved 5.8 \u00b1 0.5 mm of the chip's\nwidth of 6.9mm. We expected a correlation between 5.8 \u00b1 0.5 mm and 6.9 mm, but this\ncorrelation is probably so small that it can not be distinguished from peaks caused by CCS.\nAn attempt to distinguish samples resulted in the recognition of five out of ten paper\nsamples. These results were obtained using a 2.62 \u00b1 0.02 mm circular spot and a CCD. The sample\nwas positioned at 30 cm with respect to the CCD. We suspect that five samples were not\nrecognized because the required accuracy of replacing the samples was not met. The setup has a\nlarge potential of recognizing a large amount of samples since recognition with a 'peak value to\nstandard deviation'-ratio of 32 was obtained after thirty minutes and replacing the sample holder.\nThis measurement has not been optimal since it has been shown that a 'peak value to standard\ndeviation'-ratio of 60 can be obtained.\n\n16\n\n\f6 Recommendations\nThe setup will yield better results when a sample holder with hardly any angular dependence is\nused. When the CCD is integrated in the same construction as the sample holder, the angular\ndependence is strongly reduced. By sliding the paper into the holder and pressing it against a wall,\nthe variation in x-direction can be minimized too.\nA larger experiment should be performed. When 500 samples are taken a uniqueness\nfactor of 1083 will be required. This experiment requires the significant improvements of the\nsample holder mentioned above.\nA distance dependence in the sensitivity to displacements in x-direction was found. When\nthe 365 \u00b1 5 \u03bcm spot was used at 10.0 cm the sample could be displaced 54 \u00b1 1 % of the spot's\nwidth. In case of the line this was less, namely 25 \u00b1 5 %. When the spot was increased this\npercentage was expected to increase too, but it decreased to 35 \u00b1 4 %. Because the distance was\nincreased to 30 cm together with increasing the spot size, a distance dependence is expected. The\ndistance dependence can be explained by reasoning that the CCD does not \"see\" the borders of the\nspot anymore when it is very close to the sample. The simple case of an infinite spot illustrates the\neffect of the border well; the speckle pattern moves as much as the displacement of the sample. In\nthe case of the infinite spot, the correlation becomes proportional to the area of the speckle\npattern measured by the CCD before and after movement of the sample.\nThe fourth recommendation concerns the optimization of the distance between sample\nand CCD. Increasing the distance is advantageous for variations in r-direction, but the angular\nsensitivity and sensitivity in x-direction are smaller when decreasing the distance, therefore an\noptimum distance can be found.\nThe last recommendation concerns the fact that the correlations of the line are always\nstronger than those of the spot. This effect might be caused by the diaphragm; this hypothesis can\nbe verified with a simple experiment.\n\n17\n\n\f7 References\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nBuchanan J.D.R., et al.: 'Fingerprinting' documents and packaging.

For this one needs to suppose that a bright speckle is present at some point P at the\nscreen (see Figure A.1). At this point the light coming from the sample interferes mainly\nconstructively. To simplify the calculation one can assume that, on average, point D1 interferes\nconstructively with O, P 'with O' etc. For an estimation of the speckle size one needs to find a new\npoint, D2 , where P and O', P' and O', etc. interfere destructively.\nTaking for example points P1 and P2, one needs to find the change \u03b4x such that the\ncorresponding change in the path length difference OD1 \u2013 PD1 , \u03b4 (OD1 \u2212 PD1 ) is equal to \u03bb\\2.\nSince OD1 is equal to (x2+L2)1/2 and PD1 is (((d/2)-x)2 + L2)1/2, one obtains, together with the\nassumption that d<<L,\n\n\u03b4 (OD1 - PD1 )=\n\n2\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ebd\n\uf8f6\n2\n2\n2\n\uf8ec\n\u03b4 x + L - \uf8ec \u2212 x\uf8f7 + L \uf8f7 \u2245\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed2\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n2\n2\n\uf8eb \uf8eb\nx \uf8f6 \uf8eb\nd\ndx x 2 \uf8f6 \uf8f6\n\u03b4 \uf8ec\uf8ec L \uf8ec1 + 2 \uf8f7 -L \uf8ec1 + 2 \u2212 2 + 2 \uf8f7 \uf8f7\uf8f7 =\n\uf8ed \uf8ed 2L \uf8f8 \uf8ed 4L L L \uf8f8 \uf8f8\n\uf8eb d 2 dx \uf8f6\n\u03b4\uf8ec \u2212 \uf8f7=\n\uf8ed 4L L \uf8f8\nd\n\u03b4 x.\n2L\n\n(A.1)\n\nSetting this equal to \u03bb\\2 leads to an expression for \u03b4x and from there one can write the following\nexpression for the speckle size \u03c3, which is two times \u03b4x:\n\n\u03c3 \u2245 2\u03b4 x \u2245\n\n2\u03bb L\n.\nd\n\n(A.2)\n\nFigure A.1: A schematic representation for an order of magnitude estimation of\nthe speckle size.

At the lens the waist is given by the following formula;\n1/ 2\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb \u03bb1, 05 \uf8f6 2 \uf8f9\n\uf8fa\nw(1, 05) = w0,l \uf8ef1 + \uf8ec\n2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ef \uf8ec\uf8ed \u03c0 w0,l \uf8f7\uf8f8 \uf8fa\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n,\n\n(B.1)\n\nwhere w0,l is the waist of the laser, 0.315 mm and \u03bb is 632.8 nm. This beam is then focused to the\nwaist w0, f by a 200 mm lens:\n1/ 2\n\nw(1, 05) = w0, f\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb \u03bb f \uf8f62 \uf8f9\n\uf8ef1 + \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \uf8ec\uf8ed \u03c0 w0, f 2 \uf8f7\uf8f8 \uf8fa\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n,\n\n(B.2)\n\nUsing this equation in combination with B.1 the diffraction limited spot size can be calculated,\nwhich is 54.5 \u00b10.5 \u03bcm.\n\n20\n\n\fAppendix C: Diffraction limited size of the line\nIn this appendix the calculations on the line in our setup will be presented.\nThe laser light is first diverged in the first part of the setup, over a distance of 24 cm:\n1/ 2\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb \u03bb 0.24 \uf8f6 2 \uf8f9\n\uf8fa\nw(0.24) = w0,l \uf8ef1 + \uf8ec\n2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ef \uf8ec\uf8ed \u03c0 w0,l \uf8f7\uf8f8 \uf8fa\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n.\n\n(C.1)\n\nThen the light is expanded by two lenses. First the beam is further diverged by a negative lens\nwith a -75mm focal distance; it propagates over a distance of 175mm. Then the light is focused by\na 250 mm lens. The expansion of the beam can be represented by a 75mm lens f t ,1 which focuses\nthe light to a waist w0,t and then a 250 mm lens ft,2 which focuses it at 325mm. The waist w0,t can\nbe extracted from:\n1/ 2\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb \u03bb f \uf8f62 \uf8f9\nt ,1\n\uf8fa\nw(0.24) = w0,t \uf8ef1 + \uf8ec\n2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ef \uf8ed \u03c0 w0,t \uf8f7\uf8f8 \uf8fa\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n.\n\n(C.2)\n\nThe size of the spot at the second lens at 0.415 m is then given by:\n1/ 2\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb \u03bb f \uf8f62 \uf8f9\nt ,2\n\uf8fa\nw(0.415) = w0,t \uf8ef1 + \uf8ec\n2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ef \uf8ed \u03c0 w0,t \uf8f7\uf8f8 \uf8fa\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n.\n\n(C.3)\n\nSince the beam is collimated now we may assume this value to be the waist of the collimated\nbeam. This beam diverges over a distance of 83.5 cm, which gives the length of the ellipse.\n1/ 2\n\nwellipse\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb \u03bb 0.835 \uf8f6 2 \uf8f9\n= w(0.415) \uf8ef1 + \uf8ec\n\uf8fa\n2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 \uf8ed \u03c0 w(0.415) \uf8f8 \uf8fa\uf8fb\n\nC.4)\n\nWhen performing these calculations one obtains a length of 584\u00b14 \u03bcm. All components\ncan be placed with 1 cm accuracy. By filling in al the distances plus or minus a centimetre one can\nestimate the error.\nTo create a line from this round spot the light is focused by a 6cm cylindrical lens after\n77,5 cm on 1,19m from the laser, where the beam is:\n1/ 2\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb \u03bb 0.775 \uf8f62 \uf8f9\nw(1.19) = w(0.415) \uf8ef1 + \uf8ec\n\uf8fa\n2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 \uf8ed \u03c0 w(0.415) \uf8f8 \uf8fa\uf8fb\n\n.\n\n(C.5)\n\nThe thickness t ellipse of the ellipse is given by:\n1/ 2\n\n\uf8ee \uf8eb \u03bb f \uf8f62 \uf8f9\nc\nw(1.19) = tellipse \uf8ef1 + \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8fa\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ef \uf8ed \u03c0 tellipse 2 \uf8f7\uf8f8 \uf8fa\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n(C.6)\n\nThese calculations give a value of 10.3 \u00b10.1 \u03bcm.\n\n21\n\n\fAppendix D: Correlations\nCross correlation is a standard method of estimating the degree to which two signals are\nsimilar. When one wants to have a quantitative measure of shared properties of two random\nsignals one can use such a correlation function. The cross correlation may be defined as:\n\nc fh (\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u221e\n\n\u222b f ( t ) \u22c5 h ( t + \u03c4 ) dt\n\u2217\n\n(D.1)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nUsing the theory of Fourier transforms this can be written as:\n\n\u222b\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u222b\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nf \u2217 ( t ) \u22c5 h ( t + \u03c4 ) dt =\n\uf8ee 1\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 2\u03c0\n\n\u222b\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\uf8f9\nF \u2217 (\u03c9 ) \u22c5 e + i\u03c9t d\u03c9 \uf8fa \u22c5 h ( t + \u03c4 ) dt =\n\uf8fb\n\n+\u221e\n1 +\u221e \u2217\nF (\u03c9 ) \uf8ee \u222b h ( t + \u03c4 ) e + i\u03c9t dt \uf8f9d\u03c9 =\n\u222b\n\uf8f0\uf8ef \u2212\u221e\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n1 +\u221e \u2217\nF (\u03c9 ) H {h(t + \u03c4 )}d\u03c9 =\n2\u03c0 \u222b\u2212\u221e\n1 +\u221e \u2217\nF (\u03c9 ) H (\u03c9 ) e \u2212i\u03c9t d\u03c9\n2\u03c0 \u222b\u2212\u221e\n\n(D.2)\n\nSo in order to calculate a cross correlation one can first Fourier transform both signals, take the\nconjugate of one, multiply them and then do an inverse Fourier transform.\n\n22\n\n\f"}
