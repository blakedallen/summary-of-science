The critical magnitude of\ndisorder for the band edge states is computed versus the interaction exponent \u03bc by making use of\nthe conjecture on the universality of the normalized participation number distribution at transition.\nPACS numbers: 71.30.+h; 72.15.Rn; 78.30.Ly; 36.20.Kd\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn 1958 Anderson formulated a simple tight-binding\nmodel with uncorrelated on-site (diagonal) disorder and\npredicted a localization-delocalization transition (LDT)\nin three dimensions (3D): a phase of extended states appears at the band center in the thermodynamic limit if\nthe disorder magnitude is smaller than a critical value,\nwhile all states are localized at larger magnitudes of disorder.1 The phase of delocalized states is separated from\nthe two phases of localized states by two mobility edges.2\nThe concept of the mobility edge is of key importance for\nthe low-temperature transport properties of disordered\nmaterials.\nSince the advent of the single-parameter scaling hypothesis, introduced by Abrahams et al.,3 the occurrence\nof a localization-delocalization transition (LDT) in disordered systems with time reversal symmetry was ruled out\nin one- (1D) and two dimensional (2D) geometries at any\ndisorder strength (for the overview see Refs. 4,5,6,7). The\nlocalized nature of the states in 1D was pointed out even\nearlier by Mott and Twose.8\nAt the end of eighties and beginning of nineties\nit was realized however that correlations in disorder may give rise to extended states in low dimensions.9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 Thus, shortrange correlated on-site disorder was found to cause the\nappearance of extended states at special resonance energies in 1D. They form a set of null measure in the density\nof states in the thermodynamic limit,9,10,11,12,13,14 implying the absence of the mobility edges in those models. In\nspite of this fact, even the infinitesimal fraction of the\nextended states may have a strong impact on the transport properties of disordered materials. In particular,\nshort-range correlations in disordered potential were put\n\nforward to explain unusual conducting properties of polymers, such as polyaniline and heavily doped polyacetylene,11,12 as well as semiconductor superlattices grown\nwith random but correlated quantum well sequences.15\nContrary to short-range correlations in the disorder\ndistribution, long-range correlations were demonstrated\nto cause the LDT in 1D systems, which is analogous\nto the standard Anderson LDT in 3D.16,17,18,19,20,21 In\nthis regard, a 1D system with nearest-neighbor interactions and long-range correlated on-site disorder distribution with a power-like spectrum S(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b1 is critical\nwith respect to the exponent \u03b1. More specifically, when\nthe standard deviation of the energy distribution equals\nthe nearest-neighbor hopping and \u03b1 < 2 all states are\nlocalized, while for \u03b1 > 2 a phase of extended states appears at the center of the band giving rise to two mobility\nedges. The phase occupies a finite fraction of the density\nof states. A similar picture holds in 2D.23 The authors\nof Ref. 18 proposed to use the long-range correlated disorder and the appearance of a phase of extended states\nfor designing microwave filters based on a single-mode\nwaveguide. This type of disorder is also being studied in\nbiophysics in connection with the large-distance charge\ntransport in DNA sequences.25,26\nAnother 1D model which exhibits the LDT and a phase\nof extended states is an ensemble of power-law random\nbanded matrices Hik \u221d Gik |i \u2212 k|\u2212\u03b1 , where the matrix\nGik runs over a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble27,28 (for\nan overview see Ref. 29). This model is critical with respect to the interaction exponent \u03b1: for \u03b1 > 1 all states\nare localized, while all of them are delocalized at \u03b1 < 1,\nsuggesting that \u03b1 = 1 is the critical point in the model.\nWithin the framework of this model, it was demonstrated\nrigorously that (i) the distribution function of the inverse\nparticipation ratio is scale invariant at transition and\n\n\f2\n(ii) the relative fluctuation of the inverse participation\nratio (the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) is\nof the order of unity at the critical point.30,31 This finding confirmed the conjecture (which was put forward earlier32,33 ), that distributions of relevant physical magnitudes are universal at criticality (see also Refs. 34,35,36).\nThe invariance can therefore be used to monitor the critical point.37,38\nRecently, several reports addressed to the unusual localization properties of 1D and 2D tight-binding models with uncorrelated diagonal disorder and non-random\nlong-range coupling between sites m and n, which falls\naccording to a power law J/|m \u2212 n|\u03bc ,37,38,39,40,41,42 (see\nalso Refs. 43-44). More specifically, the states at one of\nthe band edges (the upper one for J > 0 and the lower\none for J < 0) undergo the LDT with respect to the disorder strength \u2206 if the interaction exponent \u03bc ranges within\nthe interval 1 < \u03bc < 3d/2, d being the dimensionality.41\nIn what follows we set J > 0, so that extended states can\nappear at the upper band-edge. The states at the other\nband-edge are strongly localized, no matter how small the\ndisorder magnitude is, thus, suggesting the existence of a\nsingle mobility edge.40 At \u03bc \u2265 3d/2 all states were found\nto be localized. The character of localization, however,\nturned out to be governed by the interaction exponent\n\u03bc. At \u03bc = 3d/2, the upper band-edge states are weakly\nlocalized, similar to those at the center of the band in the\nstandard 2D Anderson model,3 while at \u03bc > 3d/2 they\nare strongly localized.\nIn the present paper we deal with the analysis, both\nnumerical and analytical, of the localization properties\nof the latter class of 1D Hamiltonians. We calculate the\nphase diagram of the transition for the upper band-edge\nstates, i.e., the critical disorder magnitude \u2206c versus the\ninteraction exponent \u03bc, and show that \u2206c vanishes as\n(3/2 \u2212 \u03bc)2/3 when \u03bc \u2192 3/2, while it diverges as (\u03bc \u2212 1)\u22121\nwhen \u03bc \u2192 1. Applying the finite size scaling analysis we\nstudy the problem of the mobility edge and show that\nthe mobility edge approaches to the upper band edge in\nthe thermodynamic limit. In other words, the fraction\nof the delocalized states forms a set of null measure, although their number tends to infinity on increasing the\nsystem size N as N (3/2\u2212\u03bc)/(2\u2212\u03bc) (note that the dependence is sub-linear). This numerical finding is supported\nby a simple qualitative arguments based on the comparison of size scaling of two magnitudes: the bare level\nspacing at the band-edge and effective disorder seen by\nthe quasiparticle.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In the next Section, we describe the model and briefly overview qualitative arguments which brought us to the conjecture on\nthe existence of the LDT within the model. In Sec. III,\nwe present the phase diagram of the LDT for the upper band-edge states, which is calculated on the basis of\nthe statistics of the participation number. The mobility\nedge and fraction of the delocalized states are addressed\nin Sec. IV. We conclude the paper in Section V.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL AND QUALITATIVE REASONING\n\nWe consider a tight-binding Hamiltonian on a 1D regular lattice with N sites\nX\nX\nH=\n\u03b5n |nihn| +\nJmn |mihn| .\n(1)\nn\n\nnm\n\nHere |ni is the ket vector of a state with on-site energy\n\u03b5n . These energies are taken at random and uncorrelated for different sites and distributed uniformly around\nzero within the interval [\u2212\u2206/2, \u2206/2], having therefore\nzero\u221amean, h\u03b5n i = 0, and standard deviation h\u03b52n i1/2 =\n\u2206/ 12 (the angle brackets h* * * i denote average over disorder realizations). The hopping integrals Jmn do not\nfluctuate and are set in the form Jmn = J/|m \u2212 n|\u03bc , with\nJ > 0 and Jnn = 0.\nFirst, we address the disorder-free system (\u2206 = 0),\ntaking periodic boundary conditions for the sake of simplicity. Then the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (1) are\nplane waves with quasi-momenta K = 2\u03c0k/N within the\nfirst Brillouin zone k \u2208 [\u2212N/2, N/2). The corresponding\neigenenergies are given by\nE\u03bc (K) = 2J\n\nX cos(Kn)\n,\n|n|\u03bc\nn>0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the summation runs over all N sites of the lattice, and \u03bc is assumed to be larger than unity to get a\nbounded energy spectrum. The complete account for all\nterms in the sum (2) is important in the neighborhood\nof the upper band-edge, where the long-range hopping\nterms affect the dispersion vastly. At the upper bandedge (K \u2192 0) the dispersion relation (2) is as follows42\nE\u03bctop (K) = Etop (\u03bc) \u2212 J Atop (\u03bc)|K|\u03bc\u22121 \u2212 J Btop (\u03bc)K 2 ,\n(3)\nP\n\u2212\u03bc\nwhen \u03bc 6= 3. Here, Etop (\u03bc) = 2J \u221e\nn\n=\n2J\u03b6(\u03bc)\nis\nn\nthe upper band-edge energy in the thermodynamic limit,\nAtop (\u03bc) and Btop (\u03bc) are dimensionless positive constants\non the order of unity (for brevity we do not provide explicit expressions for them), and \u03b6(\u03bc) is the Riemann\n\u03b6-function. For small K, the sub-quadratic term in the\nright-hand side of Eq. (3) dominates over the quadratic\none if \u03bc < 3 and vice versa. The range \u03bc < 3 will be\nof our primary interest. We will focus later on the size\nscaling of the energy spacing at the upper band edge at\n\u03bc < 3, which is\n\u03b4E\u03bctop \u221d N 1\u2212\u03bc .\n\n(4)\n\nAt the lower band edge (|K| \u2192 \u03c0), the energy spectrum\nis parabolic:\nE\u03bcbot (K) = Ebot (\u03bc) + J Bbot (\u03bc) (\u03c0 \u2212 K)2 ,\n(5)\nP\u221e\nwhere Ebot (\u03bc) = 2 J n (\u22121)n n\u2212\u03bc is the lower band energy, which depends weakly on \u03bc, and Bbot (\u03bc) is a dimensionless constant on the order of unity. Respectively,\n\n\f3\nthe energy spacing at the bottom of the band scales as\n(6)\n\n\u03c3=\u221a\n\n\u2206\n.\n12N\n\nPHASE DIAGRAM OF THE TRANSITION\n\nIn this Section we calculate the dependence of critical\ndisorder magnitude \u2206c on the interaction exponent \u03bc \u2208\n(1, 3/2]. To detect the transition we analyze the wave\nfunction statistics. More specifically, we calculate size\nand disorder dependencies of the relative fluctuation of\n\n600\n\n\u2206c / J = 10.1 ( \u03bc \u22121)\n\n\u22121\n\n400\n\n200\n\n(7)\n\nNow, we compare the size dependence of \u03c3 to that of the\neigenenergy spacing at the top of the band \u03b4E\u03bctop (defined\nby Eq. (4)). As the system size increases the typical value\nof the eigenstate coupling \u03c3 decreases faster than the energy spacing \u03b4E\u03bctop at \u03bc < 3/2. Consider a system of size\nN and let \u03c3 be of perturbative magnitude (i.e. \u03c3 \u226a \u03b4E),\nthen the upper band-edge states are only weakly perturbed by disorder and remain extended over the whole\nsystem. Upon increasing the system size, the inequality\n\u03c3 \u226a \u03b4E gets even stronger, so that the perturbation becomes weaker and therefore the upper states will remain\ndelocalized at N \u2192 \u221e. On the other hand, large disorder\n(say, larger than the bare bandwidth) would certainly localize all the states. These arguments indicate that there\ncan exist extended states at the upper band-edge at finite\ndisorder, provided that 1 < \u03bc < 3/2. This conjecture was\nconfirmed both theoretically, by means of the renormalization group approach combined with a super-symmetric\nmethod for disorder averaging41, and numerically.37,38,40\nThe value \u03bc = 3/2 represents the marginal case in which\nthe upper band-edge states are localized weakly.37,38,41\nIn what follows, we focus therefore on the interaction\nexponent \u03bc ranging within the interval 1 < \u03bc \u2264 3/2.\nAt the bottom of the band (|K| \u2192 \u03c0) the level spacing\ndiminishes as N \u22122 , that is faster than the effective magnitude of disorder \u03c3. Thus, even if \u03c3 \u226a \u03b4E for some lattice\nsize and the states are extended over the whole system,\nthe inequality will be reversed for larger N , which will\nfinally result in strong coupling of the states and their\neventual localization. The same conclusion holds for the\nentire energy spectrum if \u03bc > 3/2.\nThe above picture implies the existence of a single mobility edge separating the phases of localized and delocalized states. We address this question in detail in Sec. IV.\n\nIII.\n\n800\n\n\u2206c / J\n\nOn introducing the disorder the eigenstates of the regular system couple to each other, which can result in\ntheir localization.

Here, the state\nindex k ranges from 1 to N . By definition, we adscribe\nband-edge states k = 1 and k = N to the uppermost and\nlowermost eigenstates, respectively. It was demonstrated\nrecently37,38 that within the considered model, the ratio\nof the standard deviation of the PN (SDPN) to the mean\nof the PN (MPN) is an invariant parameter at transition\nand therefore can be used to detect the critical point. We\nnote that wave function statistics turned out to be more\nefficient for this purpose than level statistics (the latter\nalso represents a method to monitor the transition34 ),\nbecause wave function statistics appeared to be less affected by strong finite size effects within the model (for\ndetails see the discussion in Refs. 37-38).\n\n\f4\n\n\u2206c \u2248 10.1J(\u03bc \u2212 1)\u22121 ,\n\n0.67\n\n\u2206c \u2248 32.6J (3/2 \u2212 \u03bc)\n\n.\n\n\u03bc\u21921,\n\n(9a)\n\n\u03bc \u2192 3/2 ,\n\n(9b)\n\nFirst of all, we notice that, according to Eq. (9a), the\ncritical magnitude of disorder diverges as \u2206c \u221d (\u03bc \u2212 1)\u22121\nwhen \u03bc \u2192 1. The explanation of the divergence relies\nin the fact that \u2206c \u221d E\u03bctop for \u2206c \u226b 1,38 and the uptop\nper band-edge energy E\u03bc=1\ndiverges when N \u2192 \u221e as\n(\u03bc \u2212 1)\u22121 . Contrary to that, the critical magnitude of\ndisorder vanishes as \u2206c \u221d (3/2 \u2212 \u03bc)0.67 when \u03bc \u2192 3/2,\nindicating that in the marginal case (\u03bc = 3/2) the uppermost state is localized (\u2206c = 0), in full agreement\nwith the results obtained by the renormalization group\napproach combined with a super-symmetric method for\ndisorder averaging.41\nIV.\n\nMOBILITY EDGE AND FRACTION OF\nTHE DELOCALIZED STATES\n\nHaving discussed the dependence of the critical magnitude of disorder \u2206c on the interaction exponent \u03bc for\nthe uppermost state, we now focus on the mobility edge\nand the fraction of extended states in the thermodynamic\nlimit. This question has not been addressed in previous\nstudies,37,38,39,40,41,42 except for a comment on the existence of a single mobility edge40,41 (see also the discussion\nin Sec. II).\nTo work out this problem, we numerically diagonalized\nthe Hamiltonian (1) and calculated the normalized MPN,\nhP i/N , as a function of energy for different system sizes\nN . The results of these simulations are shown in Fig. 2\nfor a particular set of interaction exponent and magnitude of disorder (\u03bc = 5/4 and \u2206 = 5J). First, one can\nsee that the upper band-edge energy increases with N as\nwas mentioned in Sec. III (see also Refs. 37-38). Note also\nthe noticeable size dependence of the normalized MPN\nof the uppermost state. This behavior reflects the finite\nsize effects already mentioned above (see the preceding\nsection). The boundaries result in a positive correction of\nthe order of N \u2212\u03bc\n\u221a to the bulk value of the uppermost wave\nfunction (\u223c 1/ N ). Consequently, the normalized MPN\ndepends on the system size as (1 \u2212 c N 1\u2212\u03bc ), where c is a\nconstant. The second, and the most important, observation is that the normalized MPN increases monotonically\non approaching the upper band edge, for all considered\nvalues of N .\n\n0.8\n\n\u03bc = 5/4\n\u2206 = 5J\n\n\u3008P\u3009 / N\n\n0.6\nN = 500\nN = 1000\nN = 2000\nN = 4000\nN = 8000\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n4\nE/J\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 2: The normalized mean participation number hPk i/N\nas a function of energy for different system sizes N calculated for the interaction exponent \u03bc = 5/4 and the disorder\nstrength \u2206 = 5J.\n10\n\n4\n4\n\n10\n\n\u03bc = 5/4\n\u2206 = 5J\n\n3\n\n10\n\n\u3008P\u3009\n\nAs the LDT occurs at the top of the band within the\nconsidered model, we calculated disorder and size dependencies of the ratio SDPN/MPN for the uppermost state.\nOpen chains were used in all calculations. Following the\nprocedure developed in Ref. 38, we obtained the critical\nmagnitude of disorder \u2206c at which uppermost eigenstates\nundergo the LDT for \u03bc \u2208 (1, 3/2]. The results of the simulations are shown in Fig. 1 by the full circles, while solid\nlines represent best fits close to the limiting points \u03bc = 1\n(Fig. 1a) and \u03bc = 3/2 (Fig. 1b).

The inset shows an enlarged view close to\nthe upper band edge.\n\nIn order to avoid the size dependence of the upper\nband-edge, we use hereafter the state index k rather than\nthe energy E\u03bc (k). In Fig. 3 we plotted the MPN as a\nfunction of the normalized state index k/N . The figure demonstrates that the MPN is independent of the\nsystem size in a wide range of the normalized state index\nk/N . The perfect collapse of the curves within this range\nclearly indicates the localized nature of these eigenstates.\nHowever, at the top of the band the MPN increases linearly with the system size and the collapse is absent (see\nthe blow-up in the inset of Fig. 3). This result suggests\nthat not only the uppermost eigenstate, but a number\nof them are delocalized, in agreement with the previous\nclaim raised in Ref. 41\n\n\f5\nWe now apply a finite size analysis of our numerical\nresults to further confirm the latter statement and to\nobtain the size scaling of the number of extended eigenstates. Figure 4 shows that the MPN for different sizes\ncollapses onto a single curve close to the top of the band\nafter introducing the rescaled index k/N 1/3 for \u03bc = 5/4.\nThe collapse holds up to a finite value of the rescaled index, which indicates that the number of extended states\nscales as \u221d N 1/3 when \u03bc = 5/4.\n10\n\n\u03bc = 5/4\n\u2206 = 5J\nN = 500\nN = 1000\nN = 2000\nN = 4000\nN = 8000\n\n-1\n\n\u3008P\u3009 / N\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n10\n\nnumber of extended states for a particular system size\nN .

(12) to the particular case \u03bc = 5/4 we\nrecover the behavior that we have found numerically,\nnamely km \u221d N 1/3 .\nThe relationship (12) provides us also with the dependence of km on the disorder magnitude \u2206, which can also\nbe compared to numerical calculations. We performed\nsuch comparison for the interaction exponent \u03bc = 5/4.\nIn this particular case, the exponent 1/(2 \u2212 \u03bc) in the \u2206dependence of km is equal to 4/3. Figure 5 shows the\nnormalized mean participation number as a function of\nk\u22064/3 calculated for different disorder strength \u2206 and a\ngiven system size N = 4000. The collapse of all curves\nonto a single one in the vicinity of the upper band-edge\nsupports the validity of Eq.

The spacing can be obtained from\nEq. (3):\n\u03b4E top\n\u03bc (k) = J C\u03bc\n\n1\nk\n\n\u0012\n\nk\nN\n\n\u0013\u03bc\u22121\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nThe constant C\u03bc absorbs all unessential numerical factors. Note the absence of the scaling of the spacing\n\u03b4E\u03bctop (k), i.e., the spacing depends on k not only on k/N .\nThis is crucial for the peculiar features of the LDT within\nthe model. Indeed, consider a chain of a particular size\nN . Assume that the disorder is perturbative for the uppermost state (k = 1), i.e., \u03c3 \u226a \u03b4E\u03bctop (1), so that states\nat the top are extended over the whole sample. Let us\nnow find the mobility edge for this finite lattice, defining\nit by the equality\n\u03b4E\u03bctop (km ) = \u03c3 .\n\n\u2206 = 0.5\n\u2206 = 1.0\n\u2206 = 1.5\n\u2206 = 2.0\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n4/3\nk\u2206\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\nFIG. 5: Normalized mean participation number as a function\nof k\u22064/3 for different disorder magnitudes with \u03bc = 5/4 and\nN = 2000.\n\nWe have also tested Eq. (12) against numerical simulations performed for other values of \u03bc \u2208 (1, 3/2) and always found an excellent agreement of the numerical data\nwith the analytic formula (12). It follows from the formula that the number of extended states increases sublinearly with the system size, namely as N (3/2\u2212\u03bc)/(2\u2212\u03bc) ,\nwhich means that the fraction of these states vanishes as\nN \u22121/(4\u22122\u03bc) when N \u2192 \u221e. From this we conclude that\nthe mobility edge approaches to the upper band edge in\nthe thermodynamic limit.\n\n(11)\n\nThe number km , which is N -dependent, divides all eigenstates into two sets: those with k < km are delocalized\nin the above sense, while eigenstates with k > km are localized in the usual sense. Thus, km provides us with the\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nWe studied both analytically and numerically the localization properties of the 1D tight-binding model with\n\n\f6\ndiagonal disorder and non-random long-range inter-site\ninteractions, Jmn = J/|m \u2212 n|\u03bc where J > 0. The\nmodel can be critical at the upper band-edge provided\n1 < \u03bc < 3/2.\nWe calculated the phase diagram of the transition (the\ndependence of the critical magnitude of disorder \u2206c on\nthe interaction exponent \u03bc) by studying the participation\nnumber statistics. The critical magnitude of disorder was\ndetected using the size invariance of the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. We found that \u2206c diverges\nas (\u03bc \u2212 1)\u22121 when \u03bc \u2192 1, which originates from the similar divergence of the upper band-edge energy. If \u03bc \u2192 3/2,\nthe critical disorder magnitude vanishes as (3/2 \u2212 \u03bc)2/3 ,\nindicating that all states are localized at \u03bc = 3/2, no\nmatter how small the disorder is.\nIt is shown, both analytically and by means of the finite size scaling analysis, that the number of extended\nstates at the upper band-edge increases sub-linearly with\nthe system size N , namely as \u221d N (3/2\u2212\u03bc)/(2\u2212\u03bc) ), therefore forming a set of null measure in the density of states\nin the thermodynamic limit. This suggests that the mobility edge is only a meaningful concept for a finite size\nsystem; it approaches to the upper band-edge in the thermodynamic limit. Although extended states form an infinitesimal fraction of the whole density of states, they\ncan provide a strong impact on the transport properties,\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2021\n1\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\nOn leave from Ioffe Physiko-Technical Institute, 26 Politechnicheskaya str., 194021 Saint-Petersburg, Russia\nOn leave from S.I.
