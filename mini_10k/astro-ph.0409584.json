INTRODUCTION\n\nA long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) is now generally\nbelieved to occur following the core collapse of a massive\nstar (Woosley 1993; Stanek et al. 2003; Hjorth et al. 2003).\nFollowing the collapse, the released energy pierces a hole\nthrough the star along its rotation axis, sweeps up and shocks\nthe surrounding interstellar medium and produces a long-lived\nafterglow emission. According to the standard fireball model\n(M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2002; Zhang & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2003; Piran 2004), the\nexpanding fireball slows down as it sweeps up more and more\nambient material and decays in brightness.\nThe standard fireball model (SFM) predicts that the afterglow light curves should be power laws in time, with a break\ndue either to one of the characteristic frequencies of synchrotron radiation moving through the observing band (e.g.\nSari et al. 1998) or because of the outflow being collimated\n(Rhoads 1999). The former would only give rise to a modest\nsteepening, while in the latter case it can be substantial in addition to being achromatic. In most cases where a break has\nbeen observed, the steepening is substantial and achromatic\nin the optical domain and the latter explanation appears to be\nthe appropriate one.\nFor the first GRB afterglow light curves observed, the SFM\nprovided adequate interpretation of the data. In recent years,\nseveral well observed afterglows have shown strong deviation\nfrom smooth power-laws, e.g. GRB 011211 (Jakobsson et al.\n2004), GRB 021004 (Fox et al. 2003; Holland et al. 2003),\nand GRB 030329 (Price et al. 2003; Matheson et al. 2003b;\nLipkin et al. 2004). Bursts like GRB 000301C, GRB 020813\nand GRB 010222 also deviate from the standard behavior as\ntheir initial light curve decay rate was slower than can be easily accommodated within the model. In these cases, a continuous energy injection may explain the slow decay as has been\nsuggested for GRB 010222 (Bj\u00f6rnsson et al. 2002).\nFor light curves showing 'bumps' and 'wiggles' during\nthe first few days, as e.g. GRB 021004, it has been suggested that these might arise when the fireball encounters density irregularities in the ambient medium (Lazzati et al. 2002;\n1\nSome of the radio data referred to in this paper\nwere drawn from the GRB Large Program at the VLA,\nhttp://www.vla.nrao.edu/astro/prop/largeprop/.\nNRAO is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated under\ncooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n2 Science Institute, University of Iceland, Dunhaga 3, IS\u2013107 Reykjavik,\nIceland, e-mail:gulli, einar, gudlaugu@raunvis.hi.is\n\nHeyl & Perna 2003; Nakar et al. 2003). Higher density regions would cause brightening episodes, while a rarification\nimmediately following the higher density appears necessary\nto get the light curve decay 'back on track'. Fox et al. (2003)\nsuggested that the light curve variability of GRB 021004 may\nbe due to refreshed shocks. Recently, it has been claimed that\nsuch models can be rejected as they are unable to explain simultaneously the bumpy light curves and the polarization as\nthe latter would not be affected by the freshly injected energy\n(Lazzati et al. 2003, hereafter L03).\nIn this Letter we show, contrary to the conclusions of\nL03, that several energy injection episodes may in fact explain the afterglow light curve re-brightenings of bursts like\nGRB 021004, each injection contributing to the light curve\nas it catches up with the previously expanding shock front\n(see also Granot et al. 2003, for a similar conclusion on\nGRB 030329). We consider injections in the SFM and apply our model to GRB 021004. We show that not only are\nthe light curves readily accounted for, but also that its polarization properties follow directly from the model. Detailed\naccount of this work as well as application to other bursts will\nbe presented elsewhere (J\u00f3hannesson et al. in preparation).\n2. ENERGY INJECTION\n\nFor a general review of the SFM we refer the reader\nto M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros (2002), Zhang & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros (2003) and Piran\n(2004). The basic idea behind the model is the self-similar\nrelativistic shock solution of Blandford & McKee (1976),\nwhere it is assumed that energy is released instantaneously\nat the onset of the burst. It is, however, both natural and\nexpected that the energy release may be either continuous\nor episodic (Rees & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1998; Kumar & Piran 2000;\nSari & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2000).\nWe extend the SFM as suggested by Rees & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros\n(1998) by applying energy and momentum conservation, as\nin Rhoads (1999), to both discrete and continuous energy injections although only discrete injections will be considered\nhere. We assume that several discrete shells are injected simultaneously with different Lorentz factors. The shell with\nthe highest Lorentz factor, \u03930 , drives the initial evolution of\nthe afterglow. Once it has decelerated to a value lower than\nthe Lorentz factor of the next shell, they will collide with a delay corresponding to the time it takes the second shell to reach\nthe first. The collision is assumed to be instantaneous and its\ndynamics is neglected as is any anisotropy that may results\n\n\f2\nfrom the shell interactions. In afterglow interpretations, the\ndelay is fixed by the start of a brightening episode. The energy of the shell is determined by the observed increase in flux\nlevel. Similar results can be achieved with a continuous energy injection as discussed by Panaitescu, M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros & Rees\n(1998), but requires a very steep energy injection profile and\nin some cases even a varying electron energy index, p.\nIn calculating light curves and spectra, we assume that the\nradiation is of synchrotron origin, and we consider the local synchrotron spectra at each point in the outflow to consist of power law segments, smoothly joined at the characteristic frequencies (Granot & Sari 2002). We integrate over\na thin shell at the equal arrival time surface. Each shell element is assumed to be locally homogeneous, its thickness\nbeing determined by the jump conditions across the shock\n(Blandford & McKee 1976) and the conservation of particles.\nWe can therefore consider general density profiles, for example a constant density environment, a wind or various density\nirregularities.\nWe calculate the instantaneous fireball polarization as in\nRossi et al. (2004). We assume a random magnetic field compressed by the blast-wave, thereby introducing some alignment perpendicular to the compressed direction (Laing 1980).\nWe evaluate at a given observer time the contribution of each\nsurface element of the equal arrival time surface to the Stokes\nparameters dU = P(\u03b8)dL cos(2\u03c6), and dQ = P(\u03b8)dL sin(2\u03c6),\nwith the angular dependence of the polarization given by\nP(\u03b8) = P0 sin2 \u03b8\u2032 /(1 + cos2 \u03b8\u2032 ) (Laing 1980). Here, \u03b8\u2032 is the\nangle from the line of sight in the comoving frame and dL\nis the local luminosity. In the optical range for most of\nthe fireball evolution, the maximum degree of polarization\nis taken to be P0 = (p + 1)/(p + 7/3) \u2248 70% for p = 2.2 (see\nRybicki & Lightman 1979, for details). For a measurable polarization to occur, the line of sight to the observer has to\nbe off the outflow symmetry axis (Ghisellini & Lazzati 1999;\nSari 1999). As in Ghisellini & Lazzati (1999), we find that\nfor an instantaneous energy release, the polarization light\ncurve has two extrema, bracketing the time when \u03b8 \u2248 1/\u0393.\nAt approximately that time the polarization angle rotates by\n90\u25e6 (Ghisellini & Lazzati 1999; Sari 1999; Granot & K\u00f6nigl\n2003). It is important to note that the maximum degree of polarization and time of change of the polarization angle depend\nstrongly on the viewing angle. The polarization evolution depends mostly on the evolution of \u0393, but is also affected by the\nevolution of the jet opening angle. Rossi et al. (2004) have\nshown that the larger the lateral velocity, the lower the polarization. We assume the sideways\n\u221a expansion is given by the\ncomoving sound speed, cs = c/ 3. Recent work has shown\nthat the lateral expansion may in fact be slower (Granot et al.\n2001), but we adopt this assumption to highlight the effects of\nthe energy injections.\nThe number of model parameters can be quite large if there\nare many brightenings. The global parameters: initial energy, E0 , Lorentz factor, \u03930 , half-opening angle, \u03b80 , ambient density, n0 (or density profile), relative energy density\nin electrons, \u01ebe , and magnetic field, \u01ebB , and electron index,\np, are determined, as in the SFM, from the initial afterglow\nevolution and the total flux level (using the burst redshift).\nAll episode parameters are fixed by the observed time of\nbrightenings and the increase in flux levels. As discussed by\nZhang & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros (2002) (hereafter ZM02), only the energy\nratios and the relative velocities are relevant as long as the relativistic phase lasts, and therefore absolute shell energies and\n\nLorentz factors are not needed. If polarimetry is available this\nmay be the most reliable way to determine the so called jet\nbreak time as the polarization angle is predicted to change by\n90\u25e6 at that time. Determining the break time from a broken\npower-law fit to the optical light curve can lead to an erroneous result if the light curve is not smooth, as e.g. in the case\nof GRB 021004. In addition, for the interpretation to be consistent, the polarization levels predicted by the model should\nagree with those observed, once all parameters have been determined. Our code has been extensively tested and compared\nto other work. We have also compared the output with analytical results, and find good agreement in parameter ranges\nwhere the assumptions used in analytical work are valid.\nThe effects of a single injection episode can be described as\nfollows: When a relativistic shell catches up with the slower\nshock front propagating into the ambient medium, it increases\nthe \u0393 of the forward shock (ZM02), but the subsequent evolution of \u0393 continues with the same decay rate as before. Reverse shocks may be expected, but these are expected to be\nweak for mild energy injections (ZM02). The flux from the\nfireball increases, but as the energy addition is instantaneous\nthe light curve decay will from then on also continue with the\nsame rate as prior to the shell injection. The rise in flux will\nnot be sharply defined in time as the flux is obtained by integration over the equal arrival time surface that smooths out\nthe transition. The injected shell will thus result in a smooth\nbump in the light curve. The net result is that the light curve\nis 'shifted' upwards at the time of the injection, but retains it\noriginal decay rate behavior from then on, the rate being most\nstrongly determined by p, and the density structure of the\nambient medium (e.g. Panaitescu, M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros & Rees 1998).\nEach energy injection episode delays the decaying evolution\nof \u0393, and causes it to increase temporarily. In addition, the\nemitting region of the relativistic outflow centered on the line\nof sight, temporarily brightens up and outshines the bright\nemitting ring-like region around the line of sight (see Waxman\n1997; Panaitescu & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1998; Granot et al. 1999, for a\ndetailed discussion). As a result the flux will increase slowing\nthe light curve decay (Kumar & Piran 2000). It is important to\nrealize that contrary to earlier statements (L03), polarization\nwill also be affected by the energy injection, as increasing \u0393\nincreases the flux, causes increased aberration, decreases the\nemitting surface area and thus decreases the degree of polarization compared to an unperturbed evolution. We will show\nexamples of these effects in the next section. Additional injections can be viewed as superpositions of repeated single\nepisodes with similar effects on the light curve.\n3. GRB 021004\n\nAs an example, we consider GRB 021004. It showed strong\nlight curve variations with a best fit light curve break time\nof 4.74 days (Holland et al. 2003). This break time was obtained by fitting a broken power law to the data and resulted\nin a rather large formal error. The afterglow also exhibited\nvariable polarization levels and a 90\u25e6 change in polarization\nangle at approximately 1.0 day (Rol et al. 2003). These two\ntime estimates, if interpreted within the SFM, should be similar but are in this case inconsistent with each other.\nWe find that the light curves can be explained by 4 injection\nepisodes, superimposed on the initial GRB event. We summarize the model parameters in Table 1, and show the model\nlight curves in Fig. 1. We set p = 2.2, as theoretical studies\nsuggest this to be a universal value (see Piran 2004, for a review and references). Using the burst redshift, z = 2.335 (e.g.\n\n\f3\nTABLE 1\nM ODEL PARAMETERS FOR GRB 021004\nParameter Value\nE0\n1.0\n\u03930\n800\np\n2.2\nn0\n26.0\nE1\n3.5\nE2\n5.6\nE3\n13.0\nE4\n7.0\n\nInitial half-opening angle is \u03b80 = 1.4\u25e6 , the line of sight angle is \u03b8v = 0.95\u03b80 ,\n\u01ebe = 0.21, and \u01ebB = 2 * 10\u22124 . n0 is in units of cm\u22123 , E0 is in units of 1050 ergs,\nand the four energy injection values, Ei , are relative to E0 .

Variability in the optical light curve is obtained by imposing 4 energy injection episodes at times indicated by the arrows. Parameters were\nadjusted so that the model light curves would also go through the X-ray\nand radio light curves as well as the polarization data. A host galaxy\nof R-band magnitude 24 was added to the model optical light curve. Rband data is from Uemura et al. (2003); Pandey et al. (2003); Holland et al.\n(2003). X-ray data is from Sako & Harrison (2002a,b). Radio data is from\nBerger, Frail, & Kulkarni (2002); Frail & Berger (2002) and the GRB Large\nProgram at the VLA (AK509)1 . Radio data hints at a 5th injection at 11-12\ndays.\n\nM\u00f8ller et al. 2002), E0 , \u03930 and n0 , are determined by demanding that the model flux matches that observed in the same way\nas in the standard model. The bumps in the R-band light curve\nare then used to set the times and relative energies of the injection episodes. Other parameters, such as \u01ebe and \u01ebB , are then\nadjusted until the model agrees with the radio and X-ray data.\nFinally, the change in polarization angle to fixes the opening\nangle of the jet, 1.4\u25e6 . Recall that this depends on the rate of\nlateral expansion, here assumed to be constant.\nAll four injections are mild (ZM02), the relative Lorentz\nfactor in all cases about 2. The relative energy of the first\ninjection is 3.5, in subsequent episodes it is 1.24, 1.27 and\nabout 0.3 of the total in the fourth episode. The peak flux from\nthe reverse shocks is maximum for the first event, a factor\nof 30 higher than from the forward shock with the frequency\nat maximum reverse flux of about 2.5 GHz. No radio data\nis available at the time of the first injection. All subsequent\nreverse shocks have lower maximum fluxes and frequencies in\nthe sub-GHz range. We therefore neglected the reverse shock\ncontributions to the flux.\n\nAs seen in Fig. 1, the model is able to account for the\nlight curves in all observed wavelength regions at all times,\nexcept for the first half hour or so when an initial reverse\nshock may be dominating the flux (Kobayashi & Zhang 2003;\nPanaitescu & Kumar 2004), and the radio data after about 20\ndays. A fifth injection may be able to account for the late\nradio data followed by a transition to a non-relativistic expansion regime at 50-60 days.\nThe intrinsic optical and X-ray spectral slopes are fixed by\nour choice of p = 2.2. At 1.4 days these are \u03b2opt = (p \u2212 1)/2 =\n0.6 and \u03b2X = p/2 = 1.1. The former is within 2\u03c3 of the\nintrinsic (extinction corrected) spectral index, estimated in\nHolland et al. (2003), of \u03b2U H = 0.39 \u00b1 0.12. Matheson et al.\n(2003a) find a steeper slope of the optical spectra but with a\nclear curvature, \u03b2 = 0.98 \u00b1 0.03. Holland et al. (2003) also\nobtained an excellent fit to the 2\u201310 keV Chandra spectral\nindex of 1.03 \u00b1 0.06, agreeing with the model prediction.\nIn the 0.4\u201310 keV range and including absorption, they find\n\u03b2X = 0.94 \u00b1 0.03. These results are consistent with those of\nButler et al. (2003) and Sako & Harrison (2002a).\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the R-band and polarization light curves\nof GRB 021004. We show the effect of each injection episode\nseparately as well as the combined result. With this interpretation, the estimate by Holland et al. (2003) of the late jet\nbreak time now has a simple explanation. The repeated energy injections slow the early light curve decay and delay the\nsteepening until after the last injection. A broken power law\nthus underestimates the pre-break decay slope and overestimates the jet break time. The change in polarization angle\nshould give a more reliable estimate of the break time.\nAs mentioned above, with only one energy release event,\nwe recover the polarization behavior of Ghisellini & Lazzati\n(1999) with differences due to our more detailed fireball\nmodel (dotted curves). Adding one injection episode clearly\nshows the effects on the optical and polarization light curves\n\n\f4\n(dashed in fig. 2). At the time of injection the polarization\nlevel drops sharply and reaches a minimum just after maximum brightness in the light curve. In this particular burst,\nthe first injection occurs before the jet break, and because the\ninjection modifies the temporal evolution of \u0393, it delays the\njet break time compared to a single event, and hence also the\n90\u25e6 change in polarization angle. The break time, as defined\nby the change in polarization angle, is approximately at 0.6\ndays. This is just before the 2nd injection and therefore goes\nunnoticed in the light curves until after the last injection.\nIncluding all four injections results in the polarization light\ncurve shown in the lower panel in fig. 2 (solid). There, the effect of each injection episode is very clear. Depending on the\nstrength of the injections, the polarization angle may change\nagain, although at a very low polarization level (see local minimum at approximately 4 days). The correlation between the\nobserved flux and polarization variations is in this interpretation seen to be directly rooted in the dynamics of the outflow.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have also applied our code to a SFM modified with density variations in a homogeneous medium, but without energy\ninjections. We modeled the variations with Gaussian profiles\nas in L03. The calculated flux is very sensitive to the number of radiating electrons and care must be taken in counting\nthem. Only when we specifically introduced the shock profile\nof Blandford & McKee (1976), did we manage to get sufficient brightenings. A proper treatment of the effects of density variations, valid at all observer times and radial ranges of\ninterest here, requires a numerical solution of the dynamical\nequations and a self consistent integration over the emitting\nregion.\nNakar & Oren (2004) have interpreted the GRB 021004 optical data using the \"patchy shell\" model where the angular\ndistribution of energy in the shock is inhomogeneous due to\nrandom fluctuations. Its application requires the angular energy distribution to be specified, but with suitable parameters\nthe model is able to account for the general trends in the data.\nA contribution to the polarization may originate in\n\nthe Galaxy or within the host. L03 conclude that for\nGRB 021004, the host contribution can be accounted for by\nusing spectropolarimetric data, while the Galaxy may dominate at low polarization levels. However, the time variation of\nthe polarization can only originate in the source.\nIt is natural to assume that the central source releases energy\nin several discrete events, essentially simultaneously. The total energy injected into the collimated outflow inferred from\nour model is about 3 * 1051 erg. It is of the same order as estimated in other bursts after beaming correction (Frail et al.\n2001). Applying beaming correction to the isotropic \u03b3-ray\nenergy estimated in Fox et al. (2003), we find that 1.5 * 1049\nergs were emitted in \u03b3-rays. We remind the reader that the\nnarrow opening angle inferred from our modeling is a consequence of assuming a constant lateral expansion velocity. In\nthis interpretation, most of the electromagnetic energy output\nin GRB 021004 was emitted at longer wavelengths.\nIn addition to GRB 021004, we have considered other burst\nwith highly variable light curves, including GRB 970508 and\nGRB 030329. Most cases considered so far can be accounted\nfor by discrete energy injections, with GRB 030329 a possible\nexception. This work will be discussed separately.\nThe self similar solution is based on the assumption of a\nuniform or a wind structured ambient medium. It may therefore be able to account for the overall behavior of the expanding shock, but one cannot expect it to be able to follow density variations in detail. For that a numerical solution of the\ndynamical equations is required. We conclude that refreshed\nshocks can in fact account for the observed variability both\nin the light curves and in the polarization properties of bursts.\nThe strongest argument in favor of our interpretation is the\nfact that we are able to account for both broad band behavior\nas well as the polarimetry within a single model.\nWe thank the referee for a constructive report and P.
