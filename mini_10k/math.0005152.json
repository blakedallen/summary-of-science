This note is mostly an exposition of an unpublished result of\nDeligne [D], which introduces an analogue of perverse t-structure [BBD] on\nthe derived category of coherent sheaves on a Noetherian scheme with a dualizing complex. Construction extends to the category of coherent sheaves\nequivariant under an action of an algebraic group; though proof of the general\nstatement in this case does not require new ideas, it provides examples (such\nas sheaves on the nilpotent cone of a semi-simple group equivariant under\nthe adjoint action) where construction of coherent \"intersection cohomology\"\nsheaves works.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet X be a reasonable stratified topological space; or let X be a reasonable\nscheme, stratified by locally closed subschemes. Let D be the full subcategory in,\nrespectively, derived category of sheaves on X, or in the derived category of etale\nsheaves on X, consisting of complexes smooth along the stratification.\nFor an integer-valued function p (perversity) on the set of strata Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne [BBD] defined a t-structure on the category D; the objects of corresponding abelian category (core of the t-structure) are called perverse sheaves.\nThe question addressed in this note is whether an analogous construction can\nbe carried out for the derived category of coherent sheaves on a reasonable scheme.\nSurprisingly, the answer is positive (with some modifications), easy, and not widely\nknown (though was known to Deligne for a long time, see [D]).\nLet us summarize the difference between the coherent case considered here, and\nthe constructible case treated in [BBD].\nFirst, in the coherent case we can not work with complexes \"smooth\" along\na given stratification, for the corresponding subcategory in Db (Coh) is not a full\ntriangulated subcategory. (If f is a function whose divisor intersects the open straf\n\ntum, then the cone of the morphism O \u2192 O has singularity on the open stratum).\nThis forces us to define perversity as a function on the set of generic points of all\nirreducible subvarieties, i.e. on the topological space of a scheme.\nThe second, more essential difference is that in the derived category of coherent\nsheaves the functor j \u2217 of pull-back under an open imbedding j does not have adjoint\nfunctors. Recall that in constructible situation the right adjoint to j \u2217 is the functor\nj\u2217 of direct image, and the left adjoint is the functor j! of extension by zero. In\ncoherent set-up the functor j\u2217 is defined in the larger category of quasi-coherent\nsheaves (Ind-coherent sheaves), while j! is defined in the Grothendieck dual category\nintroduced in Deligne's appendix to [H] (consisting of Pro-coherent sheaves).\nIt turns out, however, that in the proof of the existence of perverse t-structure\none can use instead of the object j! (F ) (where j : U \u0592\u2192 X is an open imbedding)\n1\n\n\f2\n\nROMAN BEZRUKAVNIKOV\n\nany extension F\u0303 of F to X, such that the restriction of F\u0303 to X \u2212 U has no cohomology above certain degree (depending on the perversity function). If the perversity\nfunction is monotone (see Definition 3 below) it is very easy to construct such F\u0303 .\nApplying the Grothendieck-Serre duality to this construction, we get a substitute\nfor j\u2217 (F ), which exists if the perversity function is comonotone. Otherwise the\nproof is parallel to that in [BBD].\nThus the t-structure is constructed not for an arbitrary perversity function, but\nonly for a monotone and comonotone one. (In the topological situation one also\nneeds this condition to get a t-structure on the whole derived category of constructible sheaves, rather than on the category corresponding to a fixed stratification.)\nIn [D] Deligne used the Grothendieck's Finiteness Theorem ([SGA2], VIII.2.1) to\np\np\nshow that the formulas for \u03c4\u22640\n, \u03c4\u22650\nof [BBD], a'priori making sense in a larger category containing Db (Coh), give in fact objects of Db (Coh), provided the perversity\nfunction is monotone and comonotone (see also Remark 3).\nThe results on the existence of a \"perverse\" t-structure carry over to the case of\nG-equivariant coherent sheaves, where G is a (reasonable) algebraic group acting on\na (reasonable) scheme. In this case perversity p(x) must be assigned only to points\nx of the scheme, which are invariant under the connected component of identity of\nG, as an equivariant sheaf is anyway \"smooth along the orbits.\"\nAlthough the general formalism for the equivariant category is very similar to\nthe non-equivariant one (to the extent that we found it easier not to treat the two\ncases separately), there is one construction which works in the equivariant case\nonly. Namely, the definition of the minimal (Goresky-MacPherson, or IC) extension functor j!\u2217 works only when the perversity function is strictly monotone and\ncomonotone. Though formally the proof of this statement works both in the equivariant and non-equivariant (=equivariant with trivial G) situations, the statement\ncan be nonempty in the equivariant case only. Indeed, it is easy to see, that a\nstrictly monotone and comonotone perversity function exists only if G acts on the\nscheme with finite number of orbits, and dimensions of two adjacent orbits differ\nat least by two. If this is the case, an obvious analogue of the usual desciption\nof irreducible perverse sheaves as minimal extensions of local systems is valid, and\nthe core of the t-structure is Artinian (in contrast with the core of the standard\nt-structure). An example of this situation is provided by the nilpotent cone of a\nsemi-simple algebraic group over a field of characteristic zero, equipped with the\nadjoint action (see Remarks at the end of the note).\nThe exposition would probably look better (and work in greater generality) if the\nnotion of a stack was used; however, my ignorance confined me to the language of\nequivariant sheaves (rather than the equivalent language of sheaves on the quotient\nstack).\nIt should be quite clear from the above that this paper does not contain original\nresults of the author.\nAcknowledgements. I am much obliged to Pierre Deligne for valuable explanations, and for a kind permission to use his unpublished results.\nI thank Dima Arinkin, Alexander Beilinson, Victor Ginzburg, and Dmitry Panyushev for discussions and references.\n\n\f3\n\nQuite separately, I express my deepest gratitude to Leonid Positselskii: without\nhis participation in the early stages of the work it might never have been done.\nThis work was started in the spring of 1999 when the author was a member at\nthe Institute for Advanced Study. I thank IAS for excellent work conditions, and\nNSF grant DMS 97-29992 for financial support.\n2. Preliminaries\nIn this section we collect some standard Lemmas needed in the exposition. The\nreader familiar with basic algebraic geometry certainly will not need our proofs.\nLet X be a scheme over a base scheme S; we denote the category of coherent\n(respectively, quasi-coherent) sheaves on X by CohX , QuasiCohX (or simply Coh,\nQuasiCoh if confusion is not likely). Let G be an affine group scheme over S, acting\non X.\nWe will assume that S is Noetherian, X, G are of finite type over S, and S admits\na dualizing complex (in the sense of [H] \u00a7V.2); the structure morphism fG : G \u2192 S\n!\nis assumed to be flat of finite type and Gorenstein (i.e. fG\n(OS ) is locally free).\nThe category of G-equivariant coherent (respectively, quasi-coherent) sheaves on\nG\nG\nX is denoted by CohG\nX , QuasiCohX . The forgetful functor F org : QuasiCoh \u2192\nQuasiCoh has the right adjoint Av : F 7\u2192 a\u2217 pr\u2217 F , where pr : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X and\na : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X are respectively the projection and the action. (Here Av stands for\n\"averaging\".) Since G is affine and flat, Av is exact, and the canonical morphism\nF \u2192 Av(F ) is an injection. Hence QuasiCohG has enough injectives, because\nQuasiCoh does.\nLemma 1. Any G equivariant quasi-coherent sheaf F on X is the union of its\nG-equivariant coherent subsheaves.\nProof Let a : F \u2192 O(G) \u2297O(S) F denote the coaction. For a coherent (possibly non-equivariant) subsheaf F0 \u2282 F let F0G \u2282 F be the preimage under a\nof O(G) \u2297O(S) F0 . Then one readily checks that F0G is an equivariant coherent\nS\nsubsheaf, and that F0 F0G = F .\nCorollary 1. For ? = b, or \u2212 the category D? (CohG ) is equivalent to the full\nsubcategory of D? (QuasiCohG ) consisting of complexes with coherent cohomology.\nProof It suffices to check that for a bounded above complex F \u2022 of equivariant\nquasicoherent sheaves, whose cohomology is coherent, the set of quasiisomorphic\nequivariant coherent subcomplexes in F \u2022 is nonempty and filtered under inclusion; and that any equivariant coherent subcomplex in F \u2022 lies in an equivariant\ncoherent quasiisomorphic subcomplex. This follows from Lemma 1 by a standard\nargument. Namely, let Z i , B i \u2282 F i denote, respectively, the kernel and the image\nof the differential. We construct by descending induction in i a coherent equivariant subsheaf Fci \u2282 F i satisfying the two properties: d(Fci ) = Fci+1 \u2229 B i+1 ; and\n(Fci \u2229 Z i ) \u0589 Z i /B i = Hi . If we are given a coherent subcomplex G \u2022 \u2282 F \u2022 we can\nchoose Fci to satisfy also Fci \u2283 G i .\nWe will denote the full subcategories in D+ (QuasiCoh), D+ (QuasiCohG ) consisting of complexes with coherent cohomology by Dc+ (QuasiCoh), Dc+ (QuasiCohG )\nrespectively.\nCorollary 2. Let U \u2282 X be an open G-invariant subscheme. For any F , G \u2208\nDb (CohG (U )) and a morphism f : F \u2192 G there exist F\u0303 , G\u0303 \u2208 Db (CohG (X)), and a\n\n\f4\n\nROMAN BEZRUKAVNIKOV\n\nmorphism f \u0303 : F\u0303 \u2192 G\u0303, such that f \u0303|U \u223c\n= f . For any two F\u0303 \u2032 , F\u0303 \u2032\u2032 \u2208 Db (CohG (X)) and\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u223c\nan isomorphism f : F\u0303 |U = F\u0303 |U there exists F\u0303 \u2208 Db (CohG (X)), and morphisms\nf \u2032 : F\u0303 \u2032 \u2192 F\u0303 , f \u2032\u2032 : F\u0303 \u2032\u2032 \u2192 F\u0303 such that f \u2032 |U , f \u2032\u2032 |U are isomorphisms, and f \u2032\u2032 |U \u25e6 f =\nf \u2032 |U .\nProof Let F \u2022 be a finite complex of equivariant quasicoherent sheaves on X,\nsuch that cohomology of C \u2022 |U is coherent. A construction similar to the one used\nin the proof of Corollary 1 shows that the set of coherent equivariant subcomplexes\nFc\u2022 \u2282 F \u2022 , such that imbedding of Fc\u2022 |U \u0592\u2192 F \u2022 |U is quasiisomorphism, is nonempty\nand filtered under inclusions. Moreover, any equivariant coherent subcomplex in\nF \u2022 lies in such a subcomplex. The statement follows.\nWe will write X top for the topological space of a scheme X. If x \u2208 X top is a point\nof X (respectively Z \u2282 X is a locally closed subscheme), then ix : {pt} \u0592\u2192 X top\n(respectively iZ : Z \u0592\u2192 X) will denote the imbedding.\nWe will use the same notation for a functor on an abelian category and its derived\nfunctor. In particular, for x \u2208 X top the functors i\u2217x : D? (Coh) \u2192 D? (Ox \u2212 mod),\nand i!x : D+ (QuasiCoh) \u2192 D+ (Ox \u2212 mod) are derived of respectively an exact,\nand of a left exact functor. The functor i!X factors through the derived category\nof torsion Ox modules, and has finite homological dimension (because so does the\nfunctor j\u2217 where j is an open imbedding in a Noetherian scheme).\nEverywhere below we will assume that Coh has enough locally free objects. Also,\ndealing with equivariant categories, we will assume that CohG has enough locally\nfree objects.\nThen both in D(Coh) and in D(CohG ) internal Hom (denoted by Hom) can\nbe computed as derived functor in either of the two variables, and commutes with\nthe forgetful functor from the equivariant to the nonequivariant category; also for a\n(G-equivariant) morphism f : Z \u2192 X the coherent pull-back functor f \u2217 is defined\nin both categories and commutes with forgetful functor.\nLemma 2. Let Z \u2282 X be a locally closed (G-invariant) subscheme, and n be an\ninteger. Let x \u2208 X top be a generic point of Z. Then\na) For F \u2208 D\u2212 (CohG ) we have i\u2217x (F ) \u2208 D\u2264n (Ox \u2212 mod) iff there exists an open\n(G-invariant) subscheme Z 0 \u2282 Z, Z 0 \u220b x, such that i\u2217Z 0 (F ) \u2208 D\u2264n (CohG\nZ0 );\n+\nG\n!\n\u2265n\nb) For F \u2208 Dc (QuasiCoh ) we have ix (F ) \u2208 D (Ox \u2212 mod) iff there exists an\nopen (G-invariant) subscheme Z 0 \u2282 Z, Z 0 \u220b x, such that i!Z 0 (F ) \u2208 D\u2265n (CohG\nZ0 ).\nProof Existence of an open (G-invariant) subscheme Z 0 \u2282 Z as in (a) is equivalent to i\u2217x i\u2217Z (F ) \u2208 D\u2264n ((OZ )x \u2212 mod). (Indeed, if the last equality holds, then we\ncan let Z 0 be the complement in Z to support of Hk (i\u2217Z (F )), k > n; the converse\nis obvious.)\nL\n\nWe can rewrite i\u2217x i\u2217Z (F ) = i\u2217x (F ) \u2297Ox O(Z)x . Since the functor of tensor product\nwith O(Z)x over Ox is right exact, and kills no finitely generated Ox modules by\nL\n\nthe Nakayama Lemma, we see that the top cohomology of i\u2217x (F ) \u2297Ox O(Z)x and\nof i\u2217x (F ) occur in the same degree. This proves (a).\nSimilarly, the second condition in (b) says that i!x i!Z (F ) = i\u2217x i!Z (F ) \u2208 D\u2265n ((OZ )x \u2212\nmod) (the equality here is, of course, due to the fact x is generic in Z). We\nrewrite i!x i!Z (F ) = RHomOx (O(Z)x , i!x (F )), and see that the lowest cohomology of i!x (F ) and of RHomOx (O(Z)x , i!x (F )) occur at the same degree, because\n\n\f5\n\nHomOx (O(Z)x , ) is left exact, and kills no torsion module, while cohomology of\ni!x (F ) is a torsion Ox -module.\nLemma 3. Let i : Z \u0592\u2192 X top be imbedding of a closed G-invariant subspace.\na) (cf. e.g. [H], Theorem V.4.1) For any F \u2208 D\u2212 (CohG ), G \u2208 D+ (QuasiCohG )\nwe have\n!\nHom(F , i\u2217 i! (G)) = \u2212\nlim\n\u2192 Z Hom(F , iZ\u2217 iZ (G)),\nwhere Z runs over the set of closed G-invariant subschemes of X with the underlying\ntopological space Z.\nb) If F \u2208 Db (CohG ) is such that the cohomology sheaves Hi (F ) are supported\non Z, then there exists a closed G-invariant subscheme Z \u2282 X, Z top = Z, such\nthat F \u223c\n= iZ\u2217 (FZ ) for some FZ \u2208 CohG (Z).\nProof a) Let us represent F by a bounded above complex PF of locally free\ncoherent equivariant sheaves, and G by a bounded below complex IG of injective\nquasicoherent equivariant sheaves. If I is an injective object of QuasiCohG(X),\nand Z \u2282 X is a closed G-invariant subscheme, then i!Z (I) \u2208 QuasiCohG (Z) is injective; hence locally free equivariant sheaves on X are adjusted to Hom( , iZ\u2217 i!Z (I)).\nThus RHom(F , iZ\u2217 i!Z (G)) = RHom(i\u2217Z (F ), i!Z (G)) is computed by the complex\nHom\u2022 (PF , iZ\u2217 i!Z (IG )). On the other hand, RHom(F , i\u2217 i! (G)) is computed by the\ncomplex Hom\u2022 (PF , i\u2217 i! (IG )), as i\u2217 i!Ssends injective objects of QuasiCohG into injective\nones. We have i\u2217 i! (IG ) = Z iZ\u2217 i!Z (IG ); and also Hom\u2022 (PF , i\u2217 i! (IG )) =\nS\n\u2022\n!\nZ Hom (PF , iZ\u2217 iZ (IG )), because PF is a bounded above complex of coherent\nsheaves. This implies the Lemma.\nb) The category QuasiCohG\nZ (X) of G-equivariant quasi-coherent sheaves supported on Z has enough injectives; moreover they are also injective as objects of\nthe larger category QuasiCohG (X) (this follows from the corresponding statement\nfor non-equivariant sheaves, since Av preserves sheaves supported on Z). Hence\n(see e.g [H], Proposition I.4.8) F is quasiisomorphic to a finite complex of quasicoherent sheaves supported on Z. As in the proof of Corollary 1 we can represent\nthis complex as a union of quasiisomorphic equivariant coherent subcomplexes; any\nsuch subcomplex is supported on a closed subscheme Z, Z top \u2282 Z.\nDefinition 1. An equivariant dualizing complex on X is an object DCG \u2208 Db (CohG ),\nsuch that every F \u2208 Db (CohG ) is DC-reflexive, i.e. the natural transformation\nF \u2192 Hom(Hom(F , DC), DC) is an isomorphism.\nLemma 4. F \u2208 Db (CohG ) is an equivariant dualizing complex iff F org(F ) is a\ndualizing complex.\nProof The 'if' direction is clear because Hom commutes with the forgetful\nfunctor. The 'only if' follows from [H], Proposition V.2.1, which says, in particular,\nthat if the structure sheaf O is DC reflexive, then DC is a dualizing complex. Since\nO obviously lies in the image of the forgetful functor, we see that F org(DCG ) is a\ndualizing complex.\nProposition 1. In the above assumptions X admits an equivariant dualizing complex.\nProof According to [BBD], Theorem 3.2.4 an object of the derived category of\nsheaves on a cite can be given locally provided negative local Ext's from the object to\nitself vanish. Applying it to the covering G \u00d7 X \u2192 X in the cite of flat G-schemes\n\n\f6\n\nROMAN BEZRUKAVNIKOV\n\nover X, we see that it is enough to provide an isomorphism \u03c0 \u2217 (DC) = a\u2217 (DC)\n(here that \u03c0 : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X, and a : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X are the projection and the action\nmaps), satisfying an associativity constraint on G \u00d7 G \u00d7 X. Since fG : G \u2192 S is\n!\n(OS ) is invertible; the group structure on G provides then\nGorenstein, the sheaf fG\n\u2217\n!\na canonical isomorphism fG\n= fG\n(as follows e.g. from Remark in [H], pp 143\u2217\n\u2217\n!\n144). Hence \u03c0 (DC) = a (DC) are both canonically isomorphic to fG\u00d7X\n(DCS ),\nwhich provides the desired isomorphism. The associativity constraint follows from\nfunctorial properties of f ! .\nRemark 1. Suppose that we make an additional assumption that the structure\nmorphism X \u2192 B is equivariantly embeddable, i.e. can be presented as a com\u03b9\nposition X \u0592\u2192 X\u0303 \u2192 B, where X\u0303 is a smooth B-scheme with a G-action, and \u03b9\nis a G-equivariant closed imbedding (the Sumihiro embedding Theorem [Su] (see\nalso [KKLV]) guarantees that this assumption is satisfied if S is the spectrum of\nan algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, and X is a normal quasiprojective\ndef !\ntop\nvariety). Then the Proposition becomes evident, for we can set DCG\nX = \u03b9 (\u03a9X\u0303 ),\nthe definition of \u03b9! for a closed imbedding being straightforward.\n3. Perverse coherent sheaves\n3.1. Construction of the t-structure. We keep the assumptions of section 2.\nNot to repeat the same argument twice, we treat the equivariant case from the very\nbeginning; the reader willing to restrict to the non-equivariant case should just let\nG be the trivial group (and skip 3.2 as containing no non-empty statement).\nWe change the notations. From now on Coh, QuasiCoh will denote the category\nof G-equivariant coherent (respectively, quasicoherent) equivariant sheaves on X.\nAlso X top will denote a subset in the topological space of the scheme X, consisting\nof generic points of G-invariant subschemes; we will endow X top with the induced\ntopology. Thus X top maps to the topological space of S, and for s \u2208 S the fiber\nover s is the set of points of Xs which are invariant under the component of identity\nin Gs .\nWe will say that x, y \u2208 X top are equivalent (and write x \u223c y) if x \u2208 G(y) (i.e.\nif x \u2208 Z top \u21d0\u21d2 y \u2208 Z top for a G-invariant subscheme Z \u2282 X). The set of\nequivalence classes X top / \u223c is identified with the set of points of the stack X/G.\nAccording to Proposition 1, X has an equivariant dualizing complex; we fix one,\ndenote it by DC. This choice defines the codimension function d on (all) points of\nX, which is determined by the condition that i!x (DC) is concentrated in homological\ndegree d (see [H], \u00a7V.7). We set dim(x) = \u2212d(x); if, say, X is of finite type over a\nfield, we can (and will) assume that dim(x) is the (Krull) dimension of the closure\nof x. Notice that dim(x) = dim(y) for x, y \u2208 X top , x \u223c y.\nstand\nstand\nLet \u03c4\u2264n\n: D? (Coh) \u2192 D\u2264n (Coh), \u03c4\u2265n\n: D? (Coh) \u2192 D\u2265n (Coh) be the\ntruncation functors with respect to the usual t-structure on D? (Coh). (Here ? =\n+, \u2212 or b.)\nLet p (perversity) be an integer-valued function on X top , constant on equivalence\nclasses.\nWe define the dual perversity by p(x) = \u2212 dim(x) \u2212 p(x).\nDefinition 2. We define Dp,\u22640 \u2282 D\u2212 (Coh), Dp,\u22650 \u2282 Dc+ (QuasiCoh) by:\nF \u2208 Dp,\u22650 if for any x \u2208 X top we have i!x (F ) \u2208 D\u2265p(x) (Ox \u2212 mod).\nF \u2208 Dp,\u22640 if for any x \u2208 X top we have i\u2217x (F ) \u2208 D\u2264p(x) (Ox \u2212 mod).\n\n\f7\n\nLemma 5. a) D(Dp,\u22640 ) = Dp,\u22650 .\nb) Let iZ : Z \u0592\u2192 X be a locally closed (G-invariant) subscheme. Then p defines\nthe induced perversity pZ = p \u25e6 iZ : Z top \u2192 Z. We have:\ni\u2217Z sends Dp,\u22640 to DpZ ,\u22640 ; i!Z sends Dp,\u22650 to DpZ ,\u22650 ;\nc) In the situation of (b) assume that Z is closed. Then iZ\u2217 sends DpZ ,\u22640 to\np,\u22640\nD\n, and DpZ ,\u22650 to Dp,\u22650 .\nProof a) One knows from [H], \u00a7V.6 that for any F in the bounded derived\ncategory of coherent sheaves we have i!x (D(F )) = HomOx (i\u2217x (F ), IOx )[\u2212 dim(x)],\nwhere IOx is the injective hull of the residue field of Ox . Since HomOx ( , IOx ) is\nexact and kills no finitely generated Ox module, (a) follows.\nb) follows from Lemma 2; in view of this Lemma if F \u2208 Dp,\u22640 , then for any\nx \u2208 Z top \u2282 X top there exists a subscheme Z \u2032 \u2282 Z with generic point x, such\nthat i\u2217Z \u2032 (F ) = i\u2217Z \u2032 (i\u2217Z (F )) \u2208 D\u2264p(x) (CohZ \u2032 ), which implies i\u2217Z (F ) \u2208 DpZ ,\u22640 ; and\nsimilarly for i!Z (F ).\nc) is obvious.\nProposition 2. For F \u2208 Dp,\u22640 , G \u2208 Dp,>0 we have Hom(F , G) = 0.\nProof We proceed by Noetherian induction in X; thus we can assume that the\nstatement with (X, p) replaced by (Z, pZ ) for a closed (G-invariant) subscheme Z (\nX is known. (Otherwise replace X by a minimal closed (G-invariant) subscheme\nfor which it is false).\nFix F \u2208 Dp,\u22640 , G \u2208 Dp,>0 . Let x be a generic point of X. Using Lemma\n2 we find an open (G-invariant) subscheme j : U \u0592\u2192 X containing x, such that\nj \u2217 (F ) \u2208 D\u2264p(x) (Coh(U )) and j \u2217 (G) = j ! (G) \u2208 D>p(x) (Coh(U )). Thus, of course,\nHom(j \u2217 (F ), j \u2217 (G)) = 0.\nLet i denote the closed imbedding of X top \u2212 U top into X top . Consider the distinguished triangle in Db (QuasiCoh): i\u2217 i! G \u2192 G \u2192 j\u2217 j \u2217 (G) \u2192 i\u2217 i! G[1]. By Lemma\n3(a) we see that\n!\n\u2217\n!\nHom(F , i\u2217 i! G) = lim\n\u2212\u2192 Z Hom(F , iZ\u2217 iZ (G)) = lim\n\u2212\u2192 Z Hom(iZ (F ), iZ (G)) = 0,\n\nbecause i\u2217Z (F ) \u2208 DpZ ,\u22640 , i!Z (G) \u2208 DpZ ,>0 by Lemma 5b), so Hom(i\u2217Z (F ), i!Z (G)) =\n0 by the induction hypotheses. This implies the desired equality Hom(F , G) = 0,\nsince Hom(F , j\u2217 j \u2217 (G)) = Hom(j \u2217 (F ), j \u2217 (G)) = 0.\nDefinition 3. A perversity function p is\nmonotone if x\u2032 \u2208 x \u21d2 p(x\u2032 ) \u2265 p(x);\nstrictly monotone if x\u2032 \u2208 x \u21d2 p(x\u2032 ) > p(x);\n(strictly) comonotone if the dual perversity p(x) = \u2212 dim(x) \u2212 p(x) is (strictly)\ncomonotone.\nTheorem 1. Suppose that a perversity p is monotone and comonotone. Then\n(Dp,\u22640 \u2229 Db , Dp,\u22650 \u2229 Db ) define a t-structure on Db (Coh).\nProof In view of Proposition 2 we have only to show, that for any F \u2208 Db (Coh)\nthere exists a distinguished triangle F \u2032 \u2192 F \u2192 F \u2032\u2032 with F \u2032 \u2208 Dp,\u22640 , F \u2032\u2032 \u2208 Dp,>0 .\nWe again proceed by Noetherian induction; thus we can assume that for a closed\n(G-invariant) subscheme Z ( X, and F \u2208 Db (CohZ ) there exists a triangle F \u2032 \u2192\nF \u2192 F \u2032\u2032 with F \u2032 \u2208 DpZ ,\u22640 (CohZ ), F \u2032\u2032 \u2208 DpZ ,>0 (CohZ ).\nIt will be convenient to use the following notation (see [BBD], 1.3.9). If D\u2032 ,\n\u2032\u2032\nD are sets of (isomorphism classes) of objects of a triangulated category D, then\n\n\f8\n\nROMAN BEZRUKAVNIKOV\n\nD\u2032 \u2217 D\u2032\u2032 is the set of (isomorphism classes) of objects of D, defined by the condition:\nB \u2208 D\u2032 \u2217 D\u2032\u2032 iff there exists a distinguished triangle A \u2192 B \u2192 C with A \u2208 D\u2032 ,\nC \u2208 D\u2032\u2032 . The octahedron axiom implies (see [BBD], Lemma 1.3.10) that the \u2217\noperation is associative, i.e. (D\u2032 \u2217 D\u2032\u2032 ) \u2217 D\u2032\u2032\u2032 = D\u2032 \u2217 (D\u2032\u2032 \u2217 D\u2032\u2032\u2032 ). Thus the meaning\nof the notation D1 \u2217 * * * \u2217 Dn is unambiguous.\nWe will make the following abuse of notations: for a category A we will write A\ninstead of \"the set of isomorphism classes of Ob(A)\"; and for a functor F : A \u2192 B\nwe will write F (A) instead \"image of the map from the set of isomorphism classes\nof Ob(A) to that of Ob(B) induced by F \". Then the statement we want to prove\nsays that\nD = Dp,\u22640 \u2217 Dp,>0 .\nWe claim that it is enough to show that\n[\nD=\nDp,\u22640 \u2217 iZ\u2217 (Db (CohZ )) \u2217 Dp,>0 ,\nZ\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Z runs over all (G-invariant) closed subschemes Z ( X. Indeed, by the\ninduction assumption we know that Db (CohZ ) = DpZ ,\u22640 (CohZ ) \u2217 DpZ ,>0 (CohZ ).\nThus (2) implies that\n[\nD=\nDp,\u22640 \u2217 iZ\u2217 (DpZ ,\u22640 (CohZ )) \u2217 iZ\u2217 (DpZ ,>0 (CohZ )) \u2217 Dp,>0 .\nZ\n\nRewriting the latter expression as\n[\n\u0001\n\u0001\nDp,\u22640 \u2217 iZ\u2217 (DpZ ,\u22640 (CohZ )) \u2217 iZ\u2217 (DpZ ,>0 (CohZ )) \u2217 Dp,>0 ,\nZ\n\nand noting that by Lemma 5(c) we have iZ\u2217 (DpZ ,\u22640 (CohZ )) \u2282 Dp,\u22640 , hence\nDp,\u22640 \u2217 iZ\u2217 (DpZ ,\u22640 (CohZ )) \u2282 Dp,\u22640 \u2217 Dp,\u22640 = Dp,\u22640 ,\nand simlarly for Dp,>0 , we get (1).\nLet us prove (2). Fix F \u2208 D, and a generic point x of X. Let j : G(x) \u0592\u2192 X be\nthe imbedding of the closure of G(x) (in particular, if X is irreducible, then j = id).\n!\nstand\nWe set F \u2212 = \u03c4\u2264p(x)\n(j \u2022 j (F )). Thus F \u2212 \u2208 Dp,\u22640 , because it is supported on G(x),\nand p is monotone. Also we have a canonical morphism F \u2212 \u2192 F . Let F1 be its\ncone; then i\u2217x (F1 ) \u2208 D>p(x) (Ox \u2212 mod).\nThe dual procedure (in the sense of Grothendieck-Serre duality) gives F + \u2208\np,>0\nD\n, and a morphism f : F1 \u2192 F + , such that i\u2217x (f ) is an isomorphism. More\npresicely, we set\n!\n\nstand\nF + = D(\u03c4<p(x)\nj \u2022 j (D(F1 ))).\n\nSince p is comonotone, we see by Lemma 5(a) that F + \u2208 Dp,>0 . Since the\nlocal duality for the Artinian ring Ox is an exact functor ([H], \u00a7V.6), we see\nthat i\u2217x (D(F1 )) \u2208 D\u2264p(x) (Ox \u2212 mod), thus i\u2217x (DF + )g\n\u2212\u2192i\u2217x (DF1 ), and hence also\n\u2217\n\u2217\n+\nix (F1 )g\n\u2212\u2192ix (F ).\nThus, if we set F 0 = cone(F1 \u2192 F + )[\u22121], then i\u2217x (F 0 ) = 0. Hence by Lemma\n3(b) we have F 0 \u223c\n= iZ\u2217 (FZ ) for some closed (G-invariant) subscheme Z ( X, and\nan object FZ \u2208 Db (CohZ ). So we get\nF \u2208 {F \u2212 } \u2217 {F 0 } \u2217 {F + } \u2282 Dp,\u22640 \u2217 iZ\u2217 (Db (CohZ )) \u2217 Dp,>0 ,\nwhich proves (2).\n\n\f9\n\nRemark 2. Construction of an object F + \u2208 Dp,>0 with given generic fiber (and\nwith a morphism from a given object) is the only place in this paper, where the\n(equivariant) duality formalism is used.\nCorollary 3. 1 Let j : U \u0592\u2192 X be an open subscheme, p : X top \u2192 Z be a monotone and comonotone perversity, and F \u2208 Dp,\u22650 (Coh(U )).

It was pointed out to us by Deligne that Corrolary 3 is equivalent to\nthe Grothendieck Finiteness Theorem, [SGA2], VIII.2.1.\n3.2. Coherent IC-sheaves. We will assume that p is a monotone and comonotone\nperversity function. We will denote the core of the t-structure on Db (Coh(X))\nconstructed in the previous section by P = PX = PX,p .\nLemma 6.

For a closed subscheme\nZ and an object G \u2208 Db (CohZ ) we have Hom(F , iZ\u2217 (G)) = Hom(i\u2217Z (F ), G). If\nF \u2208 P, then i\u2217Z (F ) \u2208 DpZ ,\u22640 ; however, for an object of any triangulated category\nwith a t-structure, and an object A \u2208 D\u22640 we have A \u2208 D<0 \u21d0\u21d2 Hom(A, B) = 0\nfor all B in the core of the t-structure.

(Possible\nmistakes belong to the author).\n\n\f10\n\nROMAN BEZRUKAVNIKOV\ntop\n\nSuppose that p(x\u2212 ) > p(x), p(x\u2032 ) > p(x) for any x \u2208 U top , x\u2032 \u2208 x \u2229 U ,\nx 6\u2208 U top . Then j \u2217 induces an equivalence between P!\u2217 (U ) and PU .\nThe inverse equivalence is denoted by j!\u2217 : PU \u2192 P!\u2217 (U ) \u2282 PU , and is called the\nfunctor of minimal (or Goresky-MacPherson, or IC) extension.\n\u2032\n\nProof The conditions of the Theorem say that both p\u2212 and p+ induce monotone\ntop\nand comonotone perversity functions on U ; hence they define t-structures on\nb\n\u2212\n+\nD (CohU ). Let \u03c4 , \u03c4 be the corresponding truncation functors.\n\u2212\n+\n\u25e6 \u03c4\u22650\n.\nWe first introduce an auxilary functor J!\u2217 on Db (CohU ) by J!\u2217 = \u03c4\u22640\nLemma 7. a) J!\u2217 takes values in P!\u2217 (U ).\nb) If f : F \u2192 G is a morphism in Db (CohU ), such that j \u2217 (f ) is an isomorphism,\nthen J!\u2217 (f ) is an isomorphism.\n+\nProof It is obvious that J!\u2217 (F ) \u2208 Dp ,\u22640 ; also, if F1 denotes \u03c4\u22650\n(F1 ), then\n\u2212\nwe have an the exact triangle \u03c4>0 (F1 )[\u22121] \u2192 J!\u2217 (F ) \u2192 F1 . Here certainly F1 \u2208\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nDp ,\u22650 ; and also \u03c4>0\n(F1 )[\u22121] \u2208 Dp ,\u22652 \u2282 Dp ,\u22650 . This proves (a).\nIf f is as in (b), then also j \u2217 (J!\u2217 (f )) is an isomorphism. But then J!\u2217 (f ) is a\nmorphism in P!\u2217 (U ), such that j \u2217 (f ) is an isomorphism; thus its kernel and cokernel\nare objects of PU supported on U \u2212 U . However, Lemma 6 says that J!\u2217 (F ), J!\u2217 (G)\nhave no subobjects or quotients supported on U \u2212 U .\n\u2212\n\nNow, using Corollary 2, we see from Lemma 7 that there exists a canonically\ndefined functor j\u0303!\u2217 : Db (CohU ) \u2192 P!\u2217 (U ), equipped with an isomorphism j\u0303!\u2217 \u25e6 j \u2217 =\nJ!\u2217 . We set j!\u2217 = j\u0303!\u2217 |PU . Then it is clear that j \u2217 \u25e6 j!\u2217 = idPU canonically. Also\nj!\u2217 \u25e6 j \u2217 |P!\u2217 (U) = id canonically, because J!\u2217 |P!\u2217 (U) = id. Thus j \u2217 and j!\u2217 are inverse\nequivalences between P!\u2217 (U ) and PU .\nFrom now on assume that S = Spec(k), where k is a field. For a G-orbit O \u2282 X\nwe set p(O) = p(x), where x is a generic point of O (this number does not depend\non the choice of x because x \u223c x\u2032 if x, x\u2032 are generic points of O).\nCorollary 4. For F \u2208 Db (CohG ) the following statements are equivalent:\ni) F is an irreducible object of P G .\nii) There exists a G-orbit j : O \u0592\u2192 X, such that p(O) < p(x), p(O) < p(x) for\ntop\nany non-generic point x \u2208 O , and an irreducible G-equivariant vector bundle L\non O, such that F = j!\u2217 (L[p(O)]).\nProof (ii) \u21d2 (i) is obvious from Lemma 6; let us prove (i) \u21d2 (ii). Let x be\na generic point of supp(F ), and Z \u2282 supp(F ), Z 6\u220b x be a closed (G-invariant)\nsubscheme. If F is irreducible, then for G \u2208 PZ we have Hom(F , iZ\u2217 (G)) = 0,\nHom(iZ\u2217 (G), F ) = 0. Thus Lemma 6 says that i\u2217Z (F ) \u2208 DpZ ,<0 , i!Z (F ) \u2208 DpZ ,>0 ;\nand i\u2217x (F ) \u2208 D<p(x) (Ox \u2212mod), i!x (F ) \u2208 D>p(x) (Ox \u2212mod). In particular, it follows\nthat Z can not contain generic points of supp(F ), hence supp(F ) = G(x). We also\nsee that if x\u2032 is a non-generic point of supp(F ), then p(x) < p(x\u2032 ); indeed, otherwise\nthe coherent sheaf Hp(x) (F ) has a nonzero fiber at x, but has zero fiber at x\u2032 , which\ncontradicts the Nakayama Lemma. Applying the Grothendieck-Serre duality we get\nalso p(x) < p(x\u2032 ). In particular, for any non-generic point point x\u2032 \u2208 (supp(F ))top\nwe have dim(x\u2032 ) < dim(x) \u2212 1 = dim(supp(F )) \u2212 1. Then Rosenlicht's Theorem\n(see e.g. [VP]) implies that x is a generic point of an orbit O. Thus F \u2208 P!\u2217 (O),\nso (ii) follows from Theorem 2.\n\n\f11\n\nCorollary 5. Suppose that G acts on X with a finite number of orbits, and p is\nstrictly monotone and comonotone. Then the category P G is Artinian.\nO\nProof Conditions of the Corollary imply that j!\u2217\nis defined for any G-orbit\nj : O \u0592\u2192 X. By induction in the number of orbits one can deduce (using Corollary\nO\n2) that the irreducible objects j!\u2217\n(L[p(O)]) \u2208 P generate the triangulated category\nb\nD (Coh). This implies that P is Artinian.\nO\n\nExample 1. Let G be a simple group over a field of characteristic 0 (or of large finite\ncharacteristic), and let N \u2282 G be the subvariety of unipotent elements. Then G\nacts on N by conjugation, and this action has a finite number of orbits. Moreover,\ndimension of an orbit is known to be even. Thus the set N top consists of generic\npoints of G-orbits, and we can define the \"middle perversity\" by p(xO ) = \u2212 dim(O)\n2\nfor an orbit O \u2282 N (where xO is the generic point of O). Then p is obviously strictly\nmonotone and comonotone, hence by Proposition 5 the kernel of the corresponding\nt-structure is Artinian. See [B] for more information on this example.\nRemark 4. It will be shown in [AB] that the irreducible objects of the t-structure\ndescribed in Example 1 are closely related to cohomology of (tilting) modules over\na quantum group at a root of unity. (This relation was independently conjectured\nby Ostrik).\nReferences\n[AB] Arkhipov, S., Bezrukavnikov, R., Perverse sheaves on affine flags and Steinberg variety of\nthe Langlands dual group, in preparation.\n[BBD] Beilinson A., Bernstein J., Deligne, P.
