This is accomplished using a cross correlation\nwith optical galaxies. Statistical noise levels of 20\u03bcK are achieved, unprecedented in\nthis frequency band. This lends support to the idea that large volumes of the universe\ncan be rapidly mapped without the need to resolve individual faint galaxies, enabling\nprecise constraints to dark energy models. We discuss strategies for improved intensity\nmapping.\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMany of the outstanding questions in cosmology can be addressed using maps of structure in the universe. Three dimensional maps can reveal the dynamics of the expansion,\nand are especially useful to study the effects of dark energy.\nPreviously, the only known way to obtain a 3D map of the\nstructure in the universe is via galaxy redshift surveys, that\nis by isolating millions of individual galaxies, recording spectra for each and determining each redshift. Galaxies appear\nfainter the further away they are, which makes their measurement progressively more expensive as the survey extends\nto higher redshift.\nOn the other hand, it may be possible to directly map\n3D structure at high redshift by measuring line emission\nwith coarse resolution. In this scheme the blended emission\nof many galaxies is collected together allowing large scale\nstructure to be studied even though few galaxies are individually detectable. Here the aggregate emission is treated\nas a continuous 3D intensity field so we call this strategy\n\"Intensity Mapping\".\nIntensity mapping has a distinct advantage over redshift\nsurvey techniques because of the use of detection thresholds\nin redshift surveys. Galaxies are typically not entered into\na redshift catalog unless they are detected with high confidence. Often a > 5\u03c3 threshold is set for inclusion. By using\nonly the 5\u03c3 peaks the galaxy survey throws away the great\nmajority of the emission. In contrast, in the intensity mapping scheme one measures correlations within an intensity\nfield. Here no threshold is needed and all the emission is\nused, allowing large volumes to be rapidly surveyed.\nIf the goal is the study of primordial structure, map\nresolution finer than 10 Mpc is not useful. Features of size\nsmaller than this may have been imprinted early in the big\nbang but those early imprints have been erased by more\nrecent gravitational motions. At 10 Mpc resolution a typical\n\n3D map pixel contains many galaxies, making searches for\ntheir aggregate emission promising.\nSeveral recent papers have proposed using Intensity\nMapping as a tool to trace the evolution of dark energy\n(Chang et al. 2007; Wyithe & Loeb 2008). Large scale (> 10\nMpc) structure maps have imprinted in them a small periodic density variation due to Baryon Acoustic Oscillations\n(BAO). These are relics of the prominent peaks seen in\nthe spatial power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. The baryon oscillation wavelength serves as a comoving \"standard ruler\". Measurement of the angular (and\nredshift space) wavelengths of these oscillation as a function\nof redshift will allow precise measurement of the kinematics of the expansion. In most cosmic evolution models dark\nenergy only becomes dynamically important at z < 2, so\nmeasurements at such redshifts are needed to distinguish\namong these models.\nThe 21cm hydrogen transition is the dominant spectral\nline at frequencies less then 1420 MHz, and is an isolated\ntransition which allows a direct translation of the frequency\nof a source into its redshift (distance). This means the 21cm\ntransition is well suited for a three dimensional intensity\nmapping experiment.\nThe challenge in such an experiment is to detect cosmic\nstructure in the 3D 21 cm intensity field beneath the much\nbrighter flux from continuum sources. Here we show that\ndetection of cosmic structure via 21 cm intensity mapping\nis indeed possible. We make this initial detection by use of\na template provided by an optical galaxy redshift survey.\n\n2\n\nDATA\n\nThe nearby southern sky was mapped in the redshifted 21cm\nline as part of the HIPASS survey (Barnes et al. 2001). This\nprogram was designed under the traditional galaxy redshift\n\n\f2\n\nPen et al.\n\nFigure 1. The HIPASS data cube R < 127h\u22121 Mpc, projected\nin a cartesian coordinate system towards the south pole.\n\nsurvey scheme in which individual galaxies are detected at\nhigh confidence, these positions are cataloged and the search\nfor cosmic structure uses the catalog. Here we do not use\nthe HIPASS galaxy catalog (HICAT), but instead use 21\ncm spectral intensity data. The HIPASS survey extends to\na distance of 127 h\u22121 Mpc and covers all declinations south\nof +25.5\u25e6 .\nFigure 1 shows a cartesian projection of the HIPASS\nintensity field. The region shown is 254h\u22121 Mpc across and\nimage pixel size corresponds to the observation beam size\n0.5h\u22121 Mpc. The large scale structure of the universe as\nmapped by the galaxies (see Figure 2) is not apparent to\nthe eye in this 21 cm image. Instead two types of features\nstand out: ring structures, likely due to discreteness in the\ndeclination scan strategy, and residual continuum emission\nfrom the Milky Way, which appears as a broad diagonal\nstructure on the left half of the image. The structure visible\nin this map is due to cleaning artifacts, including scan to\nscan calibration variation and incomplete continuum source\nsubtraction.\nMuch of the HIPASS volume was also surveyed\noptically. The six degree field galaxy redshift survey\n(6dFGS;Jones et al. (2004, 2005)) is a redshift survey of the\nsouthern sky. The full 6dFGS contains more than 120,000\nredshifts, and was collected from 2001 to 2005. The majority\nof targets were taken from the 2MASS catalog.\n6dFGS contains 27417 galaxy redshifts in the region\nof overlap with HIPASS. Their spatial locations are shown\nin figure 2. Unlike the 21 cm image the typical features of\nredshift maps are apparent, including the filamentary structure, and velocity distortions, which appear radial in this\nprojection. The figure prominently displays the cosmic web\nof large scale structure.\nJust as the eye is drawn to the continuum residuals in\nfigure 1, the autocorrelation of the HIPASS data is dominated by spurious correlations due to these structures. Sam-\n\nFigure 2. The 6dFGS catalog for R < 127h\u22121 Mpc, also projected towards the south pole. The missing wedges are the galactic\nplane.\n\npled with the 0.5 h\u22123 Mpc3 pixels we used, the variance\nis about (3.6 mK)2 . If these variations were uncorrelated\nbetween pixels, this would average down when larger structures were examined. For example, when rebinned to cells\n\u22121\nof the nonlinear length scale, i.e. cells of \u223c10\n\u221a h Mpc radius, uncorrelated noise would go down by \u223c 8000, resulting in a pixel noise around 40 \u03bcK. This would in principle\nyield a signal-to-noise comparable to the sample variance,\nleading do a sample variance limited power spectrum. Over\nthe HIPASS survey volume, there are 1000 such cells, which\ncould lead to a 30 \u03c3 detection of the large scale structure signal in the autocorrelation function. In practice, however, the\nnoise does not reduce as one averages on larger scales. Figure 3 shows the measured autocorrelation in a redshift shell\nof thickness 13 h\u22121 Mpc, centered at 95 h\u22121 Mpc distance.\nThe crosses with error bars are the measured correlation,\nwhich is much larger than the expected signal (solid line,\ndescribed below). The excess variance is presumably due to\nthe residual from incomplete foreground subtraction.\nThe HIPASS observing strategy was designed to detect\ngalaxies, rather than extended 21 cm structures. To bring\nout the cosmic structure despite the continuum artifacts we\ncomputed the cross correlation of the 21 cm intensity field\nwith the positions of the optically detected galaxies. In the\nlimit of a large survey volume, in such a cross correlation, the\ncontribution from radio continuum residuals should average\nto zero, as long as the optical and radio surveys do not\nshare common artifacts. If there are no noise correlations\nbetween the two surveys, averaging over the N = 27417\n6dFGS\n\u221a galaxies, one expects the statistical noise to reduce\nby N to 22 \u03bcK.\n\n\fFirst Detection of Cosmic Structure in the 21-cm Intensity Field\n\nFigure 3. The auto correlation of the HIPASS data cube, in a\nshell of thickness 13 h\u22121 Mpc, centered at 95 h\u22121 Mpc distance.\nThe solid line is the model prediction (see text). The signal is due\nto residual foreground subtraction. The vertical axis is a variance,\nso the residual foreground fluctuations of \u223c mK is about a factor\nof ten larger than the expected large scale structure signal.\n\n3\n\n3\n\nFigure 4. The correlation function of hydrogen 21 cm emission\nwhen stacked around optically selected galaxies from the 6dFGS.\nThe solid line is a standard clustering model. The point at zero\nseparation is the mean flux from 6dF galaxies, while points at\nlarger separations measure the associated surrounding large scale\nstructure. HI emission from the 6dF galaxies could spill up to 1\nh\u22121 Mpc into neighboring bins at the \u223c 20\u03bcK level.\n\nCROSS-CORRELATION\n\nWe computed a radio-optical cross correlation, starting by\ngridding both the 6dFGS galaxies and the HIPASS data\non a regular grid, 500 grid cells wide, with grid spacing of\n0.5 h\u22121 Mpc. Our goal is to detect cosmic structure in the\nportion of the survey where individual galaxies are difficult\nto detect with confidence. We only used data with distances\ngreater than 63 h\u22121 Mpc, i.e. distances at least half way to\nthe survey edge. This includes the majority (7/8th) of the\nsurvey volume but contains only 7% of the 4315 detected\nHICAT galaxies.\nThe HIPASS data we used had already been filtered\nboth spatially and spectrally. The data were recorded while\nsweeping the telescope in declination, and the median of\nneighboring strips in declination was subtracted from each\nbeam-width region. This spatial filter suppresses structures\nin the declination direction bigger than the beam, which is\nabout 0.5 h\u22121 Mpc at a typical distance of 100 h\u22121 Mpc. In\norder to measure a largely unsuppressed correlation, we only\nincluded pairs of HIPASS and 6dFGS cells with a transverse\nseparation of less than 0.7 h\u22121 Mpc. The frequency domain\nwas also filtered to remove continuum point sources. This is\naccomplished by removing all flux from each pixel that fits\na low order polynomial. Because of the slow variation with\nfrequency of the spectra of the continuum sources they are\nstrongly attenuated, leaving behind the 21 cm line emission.\nFigure 4 shows the measured cross correlation. We see\na significant detection at separations up to 3 h\u22121 Mpc.\nAt larger separation the correlation signal is strongly suppressed by the spatial filtering. The signal is a measure of\nthe collective HI emission of volumes adjacent to 6dFGS\ngalaxies. The strong cross correlation at zero separation is\n\nthe HI emission from the 6dFGS galaxies themselves. The\nsolid line is an estimate of the expected correlation, using the 2dFGS model (Madgwick et al. 2003). This model\nadopts a power law form for the cross correlation function\n\u03be = 35(r/r0 )\u22121.8 \u03bcK with a standard correlation length ro =\n5.5 h\u22121 Mpc (Peebles 1993). 6dFGS galaxies are preferentially early type, and typically have a longer correlation\nlength than our choice for r0 . HIPASS sources are preferentially gas rich late type, which typically have a shorter correlation length. We selected a mean value. A bias of b = 1 was\nassumed. The average 21 cm sky brightness was taken as 35\n\u03bcK (Chang et al. 2007), using \u03a9HI = 0.0004 (Zwaan et al.\n2005). A radial velocity dispersion was also assumed, which\nis convolved with the correlation function. This dispersion\nvalue was the only free parameter, chosen to fit the data.\nThe best fit pairwise dispersion is 200 km/sec. The power\nlaw correlation model does not work at zero separation, so\nthat data point was excluded from the fit.\nThe noise level of the cross correlation is less than\n20 \u03bcK. This uncertainty was determined by subdividing\nthe data set and comparing the results of the subsets.\nA direct measurement of the BAO signal was made by\nEisenstein et al. (2005), at a correlation amplitude wiggle\nof \u223c 0.01 and a lag of 109h\u22121 Mpc. In the units of figure\n4, this corresponds to an amplitude of \u223c 0.3\u03bcK, so a factor\nof 30 larger in separation and a factor of 100 smaller in the\ncurrent achieved noise amplitude. The maximum radius of\nthe HIPASS survey is too small to search for features with\nsuch a large wavelength.\n\n\f4\n4\n\nPen et al.\nFUTURE PROSPECTS\n\nA program to precisely measure baryon oscillation\u2013\nand thereby to study dark energy (Kolb & et al. 2006;\nSeo & Eisenstein 2007)\u2013requires a volume 104 that of the\nHIPASS data set. This would require a dedicated intensity\nmapping survey program, and the success reported here may\nencourage 21 cm observers to rapidly proceed with such a\nprogram. There will be no optical survey of such a large volume available for cross correlation for many years to come.\nHowever, while waiting for these surveys it still may be possible to detect and study cosmic structure in the 21 cm intensity field by autocorrelation. This will require much more\ncomplete continuum removal than has been accomplished so\nfar in the HIPASS data set.\nSeveral programs1 are already underway to measure the\ncollective 21cm emission during the epoch of reionization,\nz > 6, when the neutral fraction of the universe was closer\nto unity. At the low frequency of these observations the continuum sources are very bright, so under these programs\neffective tools for continuum removal are being developed.\nIn principle, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation signal\ncould be detected at redshifts near that of the reionization.\nAssuming the universe was matter dominated at such high\nredshifts, the position of the BAO peaks is directly tied to\nthe position of the peaks at the CMB power spectrum. The\nBAO peak positions should be redshift independent between\nz \u223c 1100 and z \u223c 6. Any deviation from this expected peak\nposition would amount to detection of dynamical influences\nof dark energy at very early times. This is unexpected, and\nso would be intriguing if found.\nA low (z < 2) redshift 21 cm Intensity Mapping\nprogram would share many features with CMB surveys,\nwhich do detect baryon oscillation via autocorrelation (see\nTristram & Ganga (2007) for a recent review, and references\ntherein). On existing single-dish 21 cm telescopes, the observing strategy would be to scan in azimuth at constant\nelevation, but to do this for each field at a several local\nhour angles, thereby creating a cross-linked data set. Such\nobserving techniques and their analysis pipelines have developed over the forty year history of CMB observations, and\nare very effective (Spergel et al. 2007; Reichardt et al. 2008;\nJones et al. 2006). Such a program might succeed in detecting the cosmic web structure but the sky coverage needed for\nprecise BAO studies may be difficult to obtain using existing\nsingle dish telescopes.\nOne approach to rapidly map large areas of sky is to\nuse interferometers, which offer excellent instrumental stability and mapping speed. Since one is searching for large\nangular scale features, existing interferometers such as the\nVery Large Array, are not appropriate since they are insensitive to large angular scales. Instead, a dedicated compact array, in the spirit of successful CMB experiments\nlike DASI (Kovac et al. 2002) and CBI (Padin et al. 2002),\n\n1\n\nGiant\nMetrewave\nRadio\nTelescope\n(GMRT;\nhttp://www.ncra.tifr.res.in ), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR;\nhttp://www.lofar.org), Murchison Widefield Array (MWA;\nhttp://web.haystack.mit.edu/arrays/MWA ), Primeval Structure\nTelescope (PAST; http://web.phys.cmu.edu/$\\sim$past/), and\nSquare Kilometre Array (SKA; http://www.skatelescope.org ).\n\ncould achieve an all sky map of most of the visible universe\n(Chang et al. 2007; Wyithe & Loeb 2008).\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe report the first detection of cosmic structure via extended 21 cm hydrogen emission. Optically measured galaxy\npositions in three dimensions were used as a finding chart\nto locate the density peaks of cosmic structure, and the 21\ncm excess brightness is detected at up to 3 h\u22121 Mpc distance from these galaxies. Due to the spatial filtering in the\nHIPASS maps, most of the correlation signal comes from\ncorrelations along the line of sight, rather than transverse\nstructure. The detection is a cross correlation, and represents a first step towards mapping the cosmic structure using\n21cm emission.\nProposed programs to measure baryon oscillations via\n21 cm intensity mapping will need to measure autocorrelations of 21 cm flux at separations larger than 100 h\u22121 Mpc.\nWhile the HIPASS data set we used covers a volume too\nsmall to test such plans directly, the low noise level of the\ncorrelation we measure is encouraging.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBarnes D.
