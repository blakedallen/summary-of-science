The detailed quantitative fit of Standard Model\npredictions to precision electroweak data strongly suggests that electroweak\nsymmetry is broken by one or more weakly coupled Higgs doublets. However,\nfundamental scalar particles suffer from a radiative instability in their masses,\nleading us to expect additional structure (such as compositeness, supersymmetry, little Higgs, ...) near the weak scale.\n\n2\n\n\fInterestingly, we can turn this problem into a prediction for the LHC. The\nargument goes as follows: let us assume that precision electroweak data are\nindeed telling us that there are no new particles beyond the Standard Model\n(with the exception of possible additional Higgs doublets) with masses at or\nbelow the weak scale. Then physics at the weak scale may be described by\nan \"effective Standard Model\" which has the particle content of the Standard\nModel and in which possible new physics is parametrized by higher-dimensional\n> TeV. All renormalizable\noperators suppressed by the new physics scale \u039b \u223c\ncouplings are as in the Standard Model. If there are additional Higgs fields then\nmore complicated Higgs self-couplings as well as Yukawa couplings are possible.\nSince no Higgs particles have been discovered so far, the effects of additional\nHiggs fields can be parametrized by effective operators for the Standard Model\nfields.\nThe higher-dimensional operators can be categorized by the symmetries\nwhich they break. The relevant symmetries are baryon and lepton number\n(B and L), CP and flavor symmetries, and custodial SU (2) symmetry. The\nwealth of indirect experimental data can then be translated into bounds on the\nscale suppressing the operators [1, 2, 3, 4]. Examples of such operators and the\nresulting bounds are summarized in Table 1. The bounds imply that physics at\nthe TeV scale has to conserve B and L, flavor and CP to a very high accuracy,\nand that violations of custodial symmetry and contributions to the S-parameter\nshould also be small.\nbroken symmetry\n\noperators\n\nscale \u039b\n\nB, L\n\n(QQQL)/\u039b2\n\n1013 TeV\n\n2\n \u0304 ds)/\u039b\n \u0304\n(ds\n\n1000 TeV\n\nflavor (1,2nd family), CP\nflavor\n\n(2,3rd\n\nfamily)\n\nmb (s\u0304\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd\n\nF \u03bc\u03bd b)/\u039b2\n\n50 TeV\n\ncustodial SU (2)\n\n(h\u2020 D\u03bc h)2 /\u039b2\n\n5 TeV\n\nnone (S-parameter)\n\n(D 2 h\u2020 D 2 h)/\u039b2\n\n5 TeV\n\nTable 1: Lower bounds on the scale which suppresses higher-dimensional operators that violate approximate symmetries of the Standard Model.\nThe question then becomes if it is possible to add new physics at the TeV\nscale to the SM which stabilizes the Higgs mass but does not violate the above\nbounds. To understand the requirements on this new physics better we must\nlook at the source of the Higgs mass instability. The three most dangerous\nradiative corrections to the Higgs mass in the Standard Model come from oneloop diagrams with top quarks, SU (2) gauge bosons, and the Higgs itself running\nin the loop (Figure 1).\nAll other diagrams give smaller contributions because they involve small\ncoupling constants. Assuming that the Standard Model remains valid up to a\ncut-off of order the LHC center-of-mass energy, \u039b \u223c 10 TeV, the three diagrams\n\n3\n\n\fW,Z, \u03b3\n\ntop\n\nhiggs\n\nFigure 1: The most significant quadratically divergent contributions to the\nHiggs mass in the Standard Model.\ngive\n\u2212 8\u03c03 2 \u03bb2t \u039b2\n\ntop loop\n\n9\n2 2\n64\u03c0 2 g \u039b\n1\n2 2\n16\u03c0 2 \u03bb \u039b\n\nSU (2) gauge boson loops\nHiggs loop\n\n\u223c \u2212(2 TeV)2\n\n\u223c (700 GeV)2\n\n\u223c (500 GeV)2 .\n\nThe total Higgs mass-squared includes the sum of these loop contributions and\na tree-level mass-squared parameter.\nTo obtain a weak-scale expectation value for the Higgs without worse than\n10% fine tuning, the top, gauge, and Higgs loops must be cut off at scales\nsatisfying\n\u039btop\n\n<\n\u223c\n\n2 TeV\n\n\u039bgauge\n\n<\n\u223c\n\n5 TeV\n\n\u039bHiggs\n\n<\n\u223c\n\n10 TeV.\n\n(1)\n\nWe see that the Standard Model with a cut-off near the maximum attainable\nenergy at the Tevatron (\u223c 1 TeV) is natural, and we should not be surprised\nthat we have not observed any new physics. However, the Standard Model with\na cut-off of order the LHC energy would be fine tuned, and so we should expect\nto see new physics at the LHC.\nMore specifically, we expect new physics that cuts off the divergent top\nloop at or below 2 TeV. In a weakly coupled theory this implies that there are\nnew particles with masses at or below 2 TeV. These particles must couple to the\nHiggs, giving rise to a new loop diagram that cancels the quadratically divergent\ncontribution from the top loop. For this cancellation to be natural, the new\nparticles must be related to the top quark by some symmetry, implying that the\nnew particles have similar quantum numbers to top quarks. Thus naturalness\narguments predict a new multiplet of colored particles with mass below 2 TeV,\nparticles that would be easily produced at the LHC. In supersymmetry these\nnew particles are of course the top squarks.\nSimilarly, the contributions from SU (2) gauge loops must be canceled by\nnew particles related to the Standard Model SU (2) gauge bosons by symmetry,\nand the masses of these particles must be at or below 5 TeV for the cancellation\nto be natural. Finally, the Higgs loop requires new particles related to the Higgs\nitself at or below 10 TeV. Given the LHC's 14 TeV center-of-mass energy, these\npredictions are very exciting, and encourage us to explore different possibilities\nfor what the new particles could be.\n4\n\n\fIt could be that the new particles are the superpartners predicted by the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model [5]. There the quadratic divergence\nof the top quark loop is canceled by a corresponding loop with top squarks:\nsupersymmetry predicts the necessary relationship between the top and stop\ncoupling constants. Or, it could be that the Higgs is a composite resonance\nat the TeV scale as in technicolor [6] or composite Higgs models [7, 8, 9]. Or\nperhaps extra dimensions are lurking at the TeV scale, with new mechanisms\nto stabilize the Higgs mass [10].\nHere we explore a different possibility, that the Higgs is a pseudo-NambuGoldstone boson. This idea was first suggested in [11, 12], and was recently\nrevived by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen and Georgi when they constructed the first\nsuccessful \"little Higgs\" model [13], and thereby started an industry of \"little\nmodel building\" [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,\n31, 32, 33, 34]. As we will see, in these theories the Higgs mass is protected\nfrom one-loop quadratic divergences by approximate global symmetries under\nwhich the Higgs field shifts. New particles must be introduced to ensure that\nthe global symmetries are not broken too severely, and these are the states that\ncut off the quadratically divergent top, gauge, and Higgs loops.\nThe outline of the rest of the article is as follows: in the next section we\nreview some basic aspects of Nambu-Goldstone-Bosons. Then, we describe in\nsection 3 how to construct a little Higgs theory, using the SU (3) model of\nRefs. [19, 20, 30] as an illustrative example. In section 4 we discuss the prototype\nproduct-group models of Refs. [15, 16], along with several variations. Finally,\nin section 5 we discuss precision electroweak constraints on little Higgs theories\nand the prospects for discovering the new particles they predict at the LHC.\n\n2\n\nNAMBU-GOLDSTONE BOSONS\n\nNambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs) arise whenever a continuous global symmetry is spontaneously broken. If the symmetry is exact, the NGBs are exactly\nmassless and have only derivative couplings.\nU (1) example: Consider for example a theory with a single complex scalar field \u03c6\nwith potential V = V (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6). The kinetic energy term \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2217 \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 and the potential\nare invariant under the U (1) symmetry transformation\n\u03c6 \u2192 ei\u03b1 \u03c6.\n\n(2)\n\nIf the minimum of the potential is not at the origin but at some distance f away\nas in the famous \"wine bottle\" or \"Mexican hat\" potential (Figure 2), then the\nU (1) symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum. When we expand the\nfield for small fluctuations around its vacuum expectation value (VEV), it takes\nthe form\n1\n\u03c6(x) = \u221a (f + r(x)) ei\u03b8(x)/f ,\n2\n5\n\n(3)\n\n\fr\n\u03b8\nFigure 2: The \"Mexican hat\" potential for \u03a6. The black dot represents the\nvacuum expectation value f , r is the radial mode and \u03b8 the Nambu-Goldstone\nboson.\nwhere f is the VEV,\nr(x) is the massive \"radial mode\" and \u03b8(x) is the NGB.\n\u221a\nThe factor of 1/ 2 ensures canonical kinetic terms for the real fields r and \u03b8.\nThe radial field r is invariant under the U (1) symmetry transformation of\nEq. (2), whereas the NGB field \u03b8 shifts,\n\u03b8 \u2192\u03b8+\u03b1\n\n(4)\n\nunder U (1) transformations. We say that the U (1) symmetry is non-linearly\nrealized. Suppose that we now integrate out the massive field r. We can be sure\nthat the resulting effective Lagrangian for the NGB \u03b8(x) will not include a mass\nterm for \u03b8, or any potential terms for that matter, because the shift symmetry\nforbids all non-derivative couplings of \u03b8.\nNon-Abelian examples: Generalizing to spontaneously broken non-Abelian symmetries, we find one NGB for every broken symmetry generator. For example,\nsuppose we break SU (N ) \u2192 SU (N \u2212 1) with the VEV of a single fundamental\n\u03c6 of SU (N ). The number of broken generators is the total number of generators\nof SU (N ) minus the number of unbroken generators, i.e.\n[N 2 \u2212 1] \u2212 [(N \u2212 1)2 \u2212 1] = 2N \u2212 1.\nThe NGBs are conveniently parametrized by writing\n\uf8f1 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8fc \uf8eb\n\u03c01\n0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f7\uf8f4\n\uf8fd \uf8ec ..\n\uf8f2i \uf8ec\n..\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec .\n\uf8ec\n.\n\u03c6 = exp\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f4\uf8ed 0\n\uf8f4\nf\uf8ed\n\u03c0\n\uf8f4\nN\u221a\n\u22121 \uf8f8\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n\u2217\nf\n\u03c01\u2217 * * * \u03c0N\n\u03c0\n/\n2\n0\n\u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \u2261 ei\u03c0/f \u03c60 .\n\uf8f8\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nThe field \u03c00 is real whereas the the fields \u03c01 * * * \u03c0N \u22121 are complex. The last\nequality defines a convenient short-hand notation which we will employ whenever the precise form of \u03c0 and \u03c60 is clear from the context.\n\n6\n\n\fAnother example of symmetry breaking and NGBs which has found applications in little Higgs model building is\nSU (N ) \u2192 SO(N ) .\n\n(7)\n\nHere the number of NGBs is the number of fields in the adjoint of SU (N ) minus\nthe number of fields in the adjoint of SO(N ) (antisymmetric tensor), i.e.\n[N 2 \u2212 1] \u2212\n\nN (N \u2212 1)\nN (N + 1)\n=\n\u22121 .\n2\n2\n\n(8)\n\nSU (N ) \u2192 SP (N ).\n\n(9)\n\nFor even N we also have\n\nand the number of NGBs is the number of fields in the adjoint of SU (N ) minus\nthe number of fields in the adjoint of SP (N ) (symmetric tensor), i.e.\n[N 2 \u2212 1] \u2212\n\nN (N \u2212 1)\nN (N + 1)\n=\n\u22121 .\n2\n2\n\n(10)\n\nFinally, for\nSU (N ) \u00d7 SU (N ) \u2192 SU (N ),\n\n(11)\n\nthe number of NGBs is\n2[N 2 \u2212 1] \u2212 [N 2 \u2212 1] = N 2 \u2212 1 .\n\n(12)\n\nIn this last case the symmetry breaking can be achieved by a VEV which transforms as a bi-fundamental under the two SU (N ) symmetries. Denoting transformation matrices of the two SU (N ) as L and R respectively we have\n\u03c6 \u2192 L \u03c6 R\u2020 .\n\n(13)\n\nThe symmetry-breaking VEV is proportional to the unit matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n..\n< \u03c6 >\u2261 \u03c60 = f \uf8ed\n\uf8f8.\n.\n0\n\n(14)\n\n1\n\nThis VEV is left invariant under \"vector\" transformations for which L = R \u2261 U ,\n\u03c60 \u2212\u2192 U \u03c60 U \u2020 = \u03c60 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhile other symmetry generators (the \"axial\" generators) are broken. The corresponding NGBs can be parametrized as\n\u03c6 = \u03c60 ei\u03c0/f = f ei\u03c0/f ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c0 is a Hermitian traceless matrix with N 2 \u2212 1 independent components.\n7\n\n\f2.1\n\nHow do NGBs transform ?\n\nWe now show how NGBs transform under the broken and unbroken symmetries\nin the example of SU (N ) \u2192 SU (N \u2212 1), which is often denoted in more mathematical notation as SU (N )/SU (N \u2212 1). The NGBs can be parametrized as\n\u03c6 \u2261 ei\u03c0 \u03c60 as in Eq. (6). Let's consider first the unbroken SU (N \u2212 1) transformations. Under these transformations we have\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\ni(UN \u22121 \u03c0 UN \u22121 )\n\u03c6 \u2192 UN \u22121 \u03c6 = (UN \u22121 ei\u03c0 UN\n\u03c60 ,\n\u22121 ) UN \u22121 \u03c60 = e\n\n(17)\n\nwhere in the second equality we used the fact that the symmetry-breaking \u03c60\nis invariant under the unbroken UN \u22121 transformations. Therefore the NGBs\n\u2020\ntransform in the usual \"linear\" way under SU (N \u2212 1), \u03c0 \u2192 UN \u22121 \u03c0 UN\n\u22121 .\nExplicitly, the unbroken SU (N \u2212 1) transformations are\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00dbN \u22121 0\nUN \u22121 =\n.\n(18)\n0\n1\nThe single real NGB \u03c00 transforms as a singlet, whereas the N \u2212 1 complex\nNGBs transform as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u00dbN\u22121~\u03c0\n0\n0\n0\n~\u03c0\n~\u03c0\n\u2020\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 (19)\n\uf8f8 \u2192 UN\u22121 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8U\n\uf8ed\nN\u22121 =\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n~\u03c0\n0\n~\u03c0\n0\n~\u03c0 \u00dbN\u22121\n0\n\nwhere we have used a vector notation ~\u03c0 to represent the N\u22121 complex NGBs as\na column vector. We see that ~\u03c0 \u2192 \u00dbN \u22121~\u03c0 , i.e. ~\u03c0 transforms in the fundamental\nrepresentation of SU (N \u22121).\nUnder the broken symmetry transformations we have\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n0 \u03b1\n~\n0 ~\u03c0\n\u03c6 \u2192 U ei\u03c0 \u03c60 = exp i\nexp\ni\n\u03c60\n\u03b1\n~\u2020 0\n~\u03c0 \u2020 0\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n0 ~\u03c0 \u2032\n\u2261 exp i\nUN \u22121 (~\n\u03b1, ~\u03c0 ) \u03c60\n~\u03c0 \u2032\u2020 0\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n0 ~\u03c0 \u2032\n= exp i\n\u03c60 ,\n(20)\n~\u03c0 \u2032\u2020 0\nwhere in the second equality we used the fact that any SU (N ) transformation\ncan be written as the product of a transformation in the coset SU (N )/SU (N \u2212\n1) times an SU (N \u2212 1) transformation [35]. The UN \u22121 (~\n\u03b1, ~\u03c0 ) transformation,\nwhich depends on \u03b1\n~ and ~\u03c0 , leaves \u03c60 invariant and can therefore be removed.\nEquation (20) defines the transformed field ~\u03c0 \u2032 , and in general, ~\u03c0 \u2032 is a complicated\nfunction of \u03b1\n~ and ~\u03c0 . To linear order the transformation is simple,\n~\u03c0 \u2192 ~\u03c0 \u2032 = ~\u03c0 + \u03b1\n~,\n\n(21)\n\nshowing that the NGBs shift under the non-linearly realized symmetry transformations. As in the U (1) case, the shift symmetry ensures that NGBs can\nonly have derivative interactions.\n8\n\n\f2.2\n\nEffective Lagrangian for NGBs\n\nOur goal for this section is to write the most general effective Lagrangian involving only the massless NGB fields, which respects the full SU (N ) symmetry.\nThis is where the utility of the exponentiated fields \u03c6 becomes obvious: while\nthe full SU (N ) transformations on the \u03c0's are complicated, the \u03c6's transform\nvery simply. To get the low energy effective Lagrangian we expand in powers of \u2202\u03bc /\u039b and write the most general possible SU (N )-invariant function of\n\u03c6 = ei\u03c0/f \u03c60 at every order. With no derivatives we can form two basic gauge\ninvariant objects, \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 = f 2 and \u01eba1 ... aN \u03c6a1 \u03c6a2 * * * \u03c6aN = 0. Thus the most\ngeneral invariant contribution to the potential is simply a constant. You can\nconvince yourself that the most general term that can be written at quadratic\norder is a constant times |\u2202\u03bc \u03c6|2 and therefore, we have\nL = const. + f 2 |\u2202\u03bc \u03c6|2 + O(\u2202 4 ),\n\n(22)\n\nwhere we normalized the coefficient of the second-order term such that the \u03c0\nfields have canonical kinetic terms. The kinetic term for \u03c6 expanded to higherorder in the \u03c0 fields contains interactions that determine the scattering of arbitrary numbers of \u03c0's at low energies, in terms of the single parameter f .\n\n3\n\nCONSTRUCTING A LITTLE HIGGS: SU(3)\n\nNow that we know how to write a Lagrangian for NGBs we would like to use this\nknowledge to write a model where the Higgs is a NGB. The explicit model we\nare going to construct in this section is the \"simplest little Higgs\" [19, 20, 30].\nConsider the symmetry breaking pattern SU (3)/SU (2), with NGBs\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u2212\u03b7/2\n0\nh\n\uf8f8.\n0\n\u2212\u03b7/2\n\u03c0=\uf8ed\n(23)\n\u2020\nh\n\u03b7\n\nNote that h is a doublet under the unbroken SU (2), as required for the Standard\nModel Higgs, and it is also an NGB \u2013 it shifts under \"broken\" SU (3) transformations. The field \u03b7 is an SU (2) singlet, which we will ignore for simplicity in\nmost of the following. To see what interactions we get for h, we expand\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b \u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u001a \u0012\n1\ni\n0 h\n0\n0\n0\nh\n+ * * * , (24)\n=\n+\ni\n\u2212\n\u03c6 = exp\nh\u2020 0\nf\nf\n0\nf\n2f h\u2020 h\nand therefore obtain\nf 2 |\u2202\u03bc \u03c6|2 = |\u2202\u03bc h|2 +\n\n|\u2202\u03bc h|2 h\u2020 h\n+ *** ,\nf2\n\n(25)\n\nwhich contains the Higgs kinetic term as well as interactions suppressed by the\nsymmetry-breaking scale f .\n\n9\n\n\fBecause the Lagrangian contains non-renormalizable interactions, it can only\nbe an effective low-energy description of physics. To determine the cut-off \u039b\nat which the theory becomes strongly coupled, we can compute a loop and ask\nat what scale it becomes as important as a corresponding tree-level diagram.\nThe simplest example is the quadratically divergent one-loop contribution to\nthe kinetic term that stems from contracting h\u2020 h into a loop in the second term\nin Eq. (25). Cutting the divergence off at \u039b we find a renormalization of the\nkinetic term proportional to\n1 \u039b2\n,\nf 2 16\u03c0 2\n\n(26)\n\n< 4\u03c0f .\nand therefore \u039b \u223c\nSummarizing, we now have a theory which produces a \"Higgs\" doublet transforming under an exactly preserved (global) SU (2). This \"Higgs\" is a NGB and\ntherefore exactly massless. It has non-renormalizable interactions suppressed\nby the scale f , which become strongly coupled at \u039b = 4\u03c0f . Because of the\nshift symmetry, no diagrams, divergent or not, can give rise to a mass for h. Of\ncourse, at this point the theory is still very far from what we want: an NGB\ncan only have derivative interactions, which means no gauge interactions, no\nYukawa couplings and no quartic potential. Any of these interactions explicitly\nbreak the shift symmetry h \u2192 h + const. In the following subsections we discuss how to add these interactions without re-introducing one-loop quadratic\ndivergences.\n\n3.1\n\nGauge interactions\n\nLet us try to introduce the SU (2) gauge interactions for h (we ignore hypercharge for the moment, it will be easy to add later). To do so we simply follow\nour nose and see where it leads us. We will arrive at the right answer after a\nfew unsuccessful attempts.\nFirst attempt: Let's simply couple h to SU (2) gauge bosons in the usual\nway, by adding to the Lagrangian of Eq. (25) the term\n|gW\u03bc h|2 ,\n\n(27)\n\nalong with another term with one derivative and one SU (2) gauge boson W\u03bc ,\nas required by gauge invariance. These terms lead to quadratically divergent\nFeynman diagrams (Figure 3) that generate a mass term\ng2 2 \u2020\n\u039b h h.\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(28)\n\nNote that these diagrams are exactly the quadratically divergent Standard\nModel gauge loops which we set out to cancel. We have apparently gained\nnothing: we started with a theory in which the Higgs was protected by a nonlinearly realized SU (3) symmetry (under which h shifts), but then we added\nthe term of Eq. (27), which completely and explicitly breaks the symmetry. Of\n10\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3: Quadratically divergent gauge loop contributions to the Higgs mass.\ncourse, we necessarily have to break the shift symmetry in order to generate\ngauge interactions for h, but we must break the symmetry in a subtler way to\navoid quadratic divergences in the Higgs mass.\nSecond attempt: Let's couple h to gauge fields through the more SU (3)symmetric looking expression\n\u0013\n\u0012\nW\u03bc\n\u03c6 |2 ,\n(29)\n|g\n0\nwhere W\u03bc contains the three SU (2) gauge bosons. (Really, we write |D\u03bc \u03c6|2 ,\nwhere the covariant derivative involves only SU (2) gauge bosons. The twogauge-boson-coupling is then Eq. (29)). This still generates a quadratically\ndivergent contribution to the Higgs mass. The diagram is the same as before\nexcept with external \u03c6 fields, and gives\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n2\ng2 2 \u2020 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8 \u03c6 = g \u039b 2 h\u2020 h + * * * ,\n1\n\u039b \u03c6\n(30)\n2\n16\u03c0\n16\u03c0 2\n0\n\nwhere the projection matrix diag(1, 1, 0) arises from summing over the three\nSU (2) gauge bosons running in the loop. Not surprisingly, we got the same\nanswer as before because we added the same interactions, just using a fancier\nnotation.\nThird attempt: Let us preserve SU (3) by gauging the full SU (3) symmetry,\ni.e. by adding |D\u03bc \u03c6|2 , where now the covariant derivative contains the 8 gauge\nbosons of SU (3). Again we can write the same quadratically divergent diagram\nand find\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n2\n2\ng\n\uf8f8 \u03c6 = g \u039b2 f 2 ,\n1\n\u039b2 \u03c6\u2020 \uf8ed\n(31)\n2\n16\u03c0\n16\u03c0 2\n1\nwhich has no dependence on the Higgs field. The quadratic divergence contributes a constant term to the vacuum energy, but no mass for the \"Higgs\"\ndoublet h! Unfortunately, we have also lost h: the NGBs are \"eaten\" by the\n11\n\n\fheavy SU (3) gauge bosons corresponding to the broken generators, i.e. they\nbecome the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons.\nWe have now exhausted all possible ways of adding SU (2) gauge interactions\nto our simple toy model for h. The lesson is that we can avoid the quadratically\ndivergent contribution to the Higgs mass by writing SU (3)-invariant gauge interactions, the problem that remains is that our \"Higgs\" was eaten. But this is\neasy to fix.\nFourth attempt (successful): We use two copies of NGBs, \u03c61 and \u03c62 , and\nadd SU (3) invariant covariant derivatives for both. We expect no quadratic\ndivergence for either of the NGBs, and only one linear combination will be\neaten. To see how this works in detail we parametrize\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n,\n(32)\n\u03c62 = ei\u03c02 /f\n\u03c61 = ei\u03c01 /f\nf\nf\nwhere we have assumed aligned VEVs for \u03c61 and \u03c62 , and \u2013 for simplicity \u2013\nidentical symmetry breaking scales f1 = f2 = f . The Lagrangian is\nL = |D\u03bc \u03c61 |2 + |D\u03bc \u03c62 |2 .\n\n(33)\n\nThe two interaction terms produce two sets of quadratically divergent one-loop\ndiagrams similar to those of the previous attempt (Figure 4.a), which give\ng2 2 2\ng2 2 \u2020\n\u2020\n\u039b\n(\u03c6\n\u03c6\n+\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n)\n=\n\u039b (f + f 2 ),\n1\n2\n1\n2\n16\u03c0 2\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(34)\n\ni.e. no potential for any of the NGBs. Moreover, only one linear combination\nof \u03c01 and \u03c02 is eaten as there is only one set of hungry massive SU (3) gauge\nbosons. A simple way to understand this result is to notice that each set of\n\na.)\n\n\u03c6i\nb.)\n\n\u03c6i\n\n\u03c6i\n\n\u03c6i\n\n\u03c62\n\n\u03c62\n\n\u03c61\n\n\u03c61\n\n\u03c6i\n\nFigure 4: a.) Quadratically divergent gauge loop contributions which do not\ncontribute to the Higgs potential, b.) log-divergent contribution to the Higgs\nmass.\ndiagrams involves only one of the \u03c6 fields. Therefore the diagrams are the same\nas in the theory with only one \u03c6, where all NGBs were eaten, and so neither \u03c61\nnor \u03c62 can get a potential.\n12\n\n\fThis reasoning doesn't apply once we consider diagrams involving both \u03c61\nand \u03c62 . For example, the diagram in Figure 4.b gives\n\u0012 2\u0013\ng4\n\u039b\n|\u03c6\u20201 \u03c62 |2 ,\n(35)\nlog\n2\n16\u03c0\n\u03bc2\nwhich does depend on h but is not quadratically divergent.

In the following we will work in the unitary gauge for SU (3),\nwhere k is rotated away. Then we have\n\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n2i\nh\n0\n\u2020\n0\nf\n\u03c61 \u03c62 =\nexp \u2212\nh\u2020\nf\nf\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2020\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n1\nh\nh h\n\u2212 2f i\n\u2212\n2\n=\nf2\n+\n*\n*\n*\n1\nh\u2020\nh\u2020 h\n33\n=\n\nf 2 \u2212 2h\u2020 h + * * * ,\n\n(38)\n\nand we see that Eq.

There are log-divergent\nand finite contributions, and from these the natural size for the \"Higgs\" mass is\nf /4\u03c0 \u223c Mweak . Thus our theory has three relevant scales which are separated\nby loop factors, \u039b \u223c 4\u03c0f \u223c (4\u03c0)2 Mweak .\n\n3.2\n\nSymmetry argument, collective breaking\n\nLet us understand the absence of one-loop quadratic divergence in the mass of h\nusing symmetries. The lesson we will learn is valuable as it generalizes to other\ncouplings, and so provides a general recipe for constructing little Higgs theories.\nWithout gauge interactions, our theory would consist of two non-linear sigma\nfields, each representing the spontaneous breaking of an SU (3) global symmetry\nto SU (2). The coset is thus [SU (3)/SU (2)]2 . There are 10 spontaneously broken\ngenerators for this coset, and therefore 10 NGBs. The gauge couplings explicitly\n13\n\n\fbreak some of the global symmetries. For example, the two gauge boson - two\nscalar coupling\nL \u223c |gA\u03bc \u03c61 |2 + |gA\u03bc \u03c62 |2\n\n(40)\n\nbreaks the two previously independent SU (3) symmetries to the diagonal SU (3)\nwhich is gauged. Thus only one of the spontaneously broken symmetries is\nexact, and only one set of exact NGBs arises, the eaten ones. The other linear\ncombination, corresponding to the explicitly broken axial SU (3), gets a potential\nfrom loops.\nHowever, as we saw before, there is no quadratically divergent contribution\nto the potential. This is easy to understand by considering the symmetries\nleft invariant by each of the terms in Eq. (40) separately. Imagine setting the\ngauge coupling of \u03c62 to zero. Then the Lagrangian has 2 independent SU (3)\nsymmetries, one acting on \u03c61 (and A\u03bc ) and the other acting on \u03c62 . Thus we\nnow have two spontaneously broken SU (3) symmetries and therefore 10 exact\nNGBs (5 of which are eaten). Similarly, if the gauge coupling of \u03c61 is set to\nzero, there are again two spontaneously broken SU (3)'s. Only in the presence\nof gauge couplings for both \u03c61 and \u03c62 are the two SU (3) symmetries explicitly\nbroken to one SU (3), and only then can h develop a potential. Therefore any\ndiagram which contributes to the h mass must involve the gauge couplings for\nboth \u03c61 and \u03c62 . But there are no quadratically divergent one-loop diagrams\ninvolving both couplings.\nThis is the general mechanism employed by \"little Higgs\" theories [13]:\nThe \"little Higgs\" is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken\nsymmetry. This symmetry is also explicitly broken but only \"collectively\", i.e.\nthe symmetry is broken when two or more couplings in the Lagrangian are nonvanishing. Setting any one of these couplings to zero restores the symmetry and\ntherefore the masslessness of the \"little Higgs\".\nWe now know how to construct a theory with a naturally light scalar doublet\nthat couples to SU (2) gauge bosons. To turn this into an extension of the\nStandard Model we still need i. Yukawa couplings, ii. hypercharge and color,\nand iii. a Higgs potential with a quartic coupling.\n\n3.3\n\nTop Yukawa coupling\n\nThe numerically most significant quadratic divergence stems from top quark\nloops. Thus the cancellation of the quadratic divergence associated with the\ntop Yukawa is the most important. Let us construct a sector that guarantees\nthis cancellation. The crucial trick is to introduce SU (3) symmetries into the\nYukawa couplings which are only broken collectively. First, we enlarge the\nquark doublets into triplets \u03a8 \u2261 (t, b, T ) transforming under the SU (3) gauge\nsymmetry. The quark singlets remain the same, tc and bc , except that we also\nneed to add a Dirac partner T c for T . Note that we are using a notation in\nwhich all quark fields are left-handed Weyl spinors, and the Standard Model\n14\n\n\fYukawa couplings are of the form h\u2020 Qtc . Let us change notation slightly to\nreflect the fact that tc and T c mix, and call them tc1 and tc2 . We can now write\ntwo terms that both look like they contribute to the top Yukawa coupling1 ,\nLyuk = \u03bb1 \u03c6\u20201 \u03a8tc1 + \u03bb2 \u03c6\u20202 \u03a8tc2 .\n\n(41)\n\nTo see what couplings for the Higgs arise we substitute the parametrization of\nEq.\u221a(37) and expand in powers of h. For simplicity, let us also set \u03bb1 \u2261 \u03bb2 \u2261\n\u03bb/ 2. This will reduce the number of terms we encounter because it preserves\na parity 1 \u2194 2, but the main points here are independent of this choice. We\nfind\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u2020\n\u03bb\nh hT (tc2 + tc1 ) + * * *\nL \u223c \u221a f T (tc2 + tc1 ) + ih\u2020 Q(tc2 \u2212 tc1 ) \u2212\n2f\n2\n1 \u2020\n= \u03bbf (1 \u2212 2 h h)T T c + \u03bbh\u2020 Qtc + * * * ,\n(42)\n2f\nc\nc\nwhere\nline is written\n\u221a in terms of the linear combinations T = (t2 +\n\u221a the second\nc\nc\nc\nc\nt1 )/ 2 and t = i(t2 \u2212 t1 )/ 2.\nThe last term of the second line in Eq. (42) is the top Yukawa coupling, and\nso we identify \u03bb = \u03bbt . The Dirac fermion T, T c has a mass \u03bbt f and a coupling to\ntwo Higgs fields with coupling constant \u03bbt /(2f ). The couplings and masses are\nrelated by the underlying SU (3) symmetries. To see how the new fermion and\n\ntc\n\nh\n\nT\n\nTc\n\nh\n\nh\n\nh\nQ\n\nFigure 5: The quadratically divergent contribution to the Higgs mass from the\ntop loop is canceled by the T loop.\nits couplings to the Higgs cancel the quadratic divergence from the top quark\nloop, we compute the fermion loops including interactions to order \u03bb2 .

They can be forbidden by global U (1) symmetries and are therefore not generated\nby loops.\n2 In order for the two cut-offs for the two loops to be identical, the new physics at the\ncut-off must respect the SU (3) symmetries. This is analogous to the situation in SUSY where\nthe boson-fermion cancellation also relies on a supersymmetric regulator/cut-off.\n\n15\n\n\fWhile this computation allowed us to see explicitly that the quadratic divergence from t and T cancel, the absence of a quadratic divergence to the\nHiggs mass is much more naturally understood by analyzing the symmetries of\nthe Lagrangian for the \u03c6i fields, Eq. (41). First note that the Yukawa coupling\nLagrangian preserves one SU (3) symmetry, the gauge symmetry. The term proportional to \u03bb1 forces symmetry transformations of \u03c61 and \u03a8 to be aligned, and\nthe term proportional to \u03bb2 also forces \u03c62 to transform like \u03a8. Thus, in the presence of both terms the global symmetry breaking pattern is only SU (3)/SU (2),\nwith 5 NGBs which are all eaten by the heavy SU (3) gauge bosons. However, if\nwe set either of the \u03bbi to zero, the symmetry of Eq. (41) is enhanced to SU (3)2\nbecause the \u03c6i can now rotate independently. Thus, with either of the \u03bbi turned\noff, we expect two sets of NGBs. One linear combination is eaten and the other\nis the \"little Higgs\".\nTo understand radiative stability of this result we observe that a contribution\nto the Higgs potential can only come from a diagram which involves both \u03bbi .\nThe lowest-order fermion diagram which involves both \u03bbi is the loop shown in\nFigure 6, which is proportional to |\u03bb1 \u03bb2 |2 . You can easily convince yourself\n\n\u03c61\n\n\u03c61\n\ntc1\n\ntc2\n\n\u03c62\n\n\u03c62\n\nFigure 6: A log divergent contribution to the Higgs mass from the top and T\nloops proportional to |\u03bb1 \u03bb2 |2 .\nthat you cannot draw a diagram which contributes to the Higgs potential and is\nproportional to only a single power of \u03bb1 \u03bb2 . This also follows from an argument\nusing \"spurious\" symmetries: assign tc1 charge 1 under a U (1)1 symmetry while\nall other fields are neutral. The symmetry is broken by the Yukawa coupling\n\u03bb1 , but we can formally restore it by assigning the \"spurion\" \u03bb1 charge -1. Any\neffective operators which may be generated by loops must be invariant under\nthis symmetry. In particular, operators which contribute to the Higgs potential\nand do not contain the fermion field tc1 can depend on the spurion \u03bb1 only\nthrough |\u03bb1 |2 . Of course, the same argument shows that the dependence on\n\u03bb2 is through |\u03bb2 |2 only. A contribution to the Higgs potential requires both\ncouplings \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 to appear and therefore the potential is proportional to\nat least |\u03bb1 \u03bb2 |2 , i.e. it has at least four coupling constants. But a one-loop\ndiagram with 4 coupling constants can at most be logarithmically divergent,\nand therefore does not destabilize the Higgs mass.\nIn the explicit formulae above, we assumed for simplicity that f1 = f2 = f\n\n16\n\n\f\u221a\nand \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = \u03bbt / 2. In the general case we find\nq\nmT =\n\u03bb21 f12 + \u03bb22 f22\np\nf12 + f22\n.\n\u03bbt = \u03bb1 \u03bb2\nmT\n\n(44)\n(45)\n\nNote that the top Yukawa coupling goes to zero as either of the \u03bbi is taken to\nzero, as anticipated from the SU (3) symmetry arguments. Furthermore note\nthat the mass of the heavy T quark can be significantly lower than the larger\nof the two fi if the corresponding \u03bbi is smaller than 1. This is a nice feature\n> few TeV\nbecause it allows us to take the heavy gauge boson's masses large (\u223c\nas required by the precision electroweak constraints) while keeping the T mass\nnear a TeV. Keeping the T mass as low as possible is desirable because the\nquadratic divergence of the top loop in the Standard Model is cut off at the\nmass of T .\n\n3.4\n\nOther Yukawa couplings\n\nThe other up-type Yukawa couplings may be added in exactly the same way.\nWe enlarge the SU (2) quark doublets into triplets because of the gauged SU (3).\nThen we add two sets of Yukawa couplings which couple the triplets to \u03c61 and\n\u03c62 and quark singlets q1c and q2c .\nIn the Standard Model, Yukawa couplings for down-type quarks arise from\na different operator where the SU (2) indices of the Higgs doublet and the quark\ndoublets are contracted using an epsilon tensor (or, equivalently, the conjugate\nHiggs field hc = i\u03c32 h\u2020 is used). Before explicitly constructing this operator\nfrom the quark and \u03c6i fields note that even the bottom Yukawa coupling is too\nsmall to give a significant contribution to the Higgs mass. The quadratically\ndivergent one loop diagram in the Standard Model yields\n\u03bb2b 2\n\u039b \u2248 (30 GeV)2\n16\u03c0 2\n\n(46)\n\nfor \u039b \u223c 10 TeV. Therefore, we need not pay attention to symmetries and\ncollective breaking when constructing the down-type Yukawa couplings. The\nStandard Model Yukawa is\n\u03bbb \u01ebij hi Qj bc .\n\n(47)\n\nTo obtain the epsilon contraction from an SU (3)-invariant operator we write\nthe Lagrangian term\n\u03bbb\n\u01ebijk \u03c6i1 \u03c6j2 \u03a8kQ bc .\nf\n\n(48)\n\nNote that the \u01ebijk contraction breaks both SU (3) symmetries (acting on the two\nscalar triplets \u03c61 and \u03c62 ) to the diagonal subgroup, and therefore this operator\ndoes lead to a quadratic divergence. But the quadratic divergence is harmless\nbecause of the smallness of the bottom Yukawa coupling.\n17\n\n\f3.5\n\nColor and hypercharge\n\nColor is added by simply adding SU (3)color indices where we expect them from\nthe Standard Model. SU (3)color commutes with all the symmetry arguments\ngiven above, therefore nothing significant changes.\nHypercharge is slightly more complicated. The VEVs \u03c6i \u221d (0, 0, 1) break\nthe SU (3)weak gauge group to SU (2), i.e. no U (1) hypercharge candidate is left.\nTherefore, we gauge an additional U (1)X . In order for the hypercharge of the\nHiggs to come out correctly, we assign it SU (3) \u00d7 U (1)X quantum numbers\n\u03c6i = 3\u22121/3 .\nThe combination of generators which is unbroken by \u03c6i \u223c (0, 0, 1) is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n1\n\u22121 8\n\uf8f8,\n1\nY = \u221a T + X where T 8 = \u221a \uf8ed\n3\n2 3\n\u22122\n\n(49)\n\n(50)\n\nand X is the generator corresponding to U (1)X . This uniquely fixes the U (1)X\ncharges of all quarks and leptons once their SU (3) transformation properties\nare chosen.\nFor example, the covariant derivative acting on \u03c6i is\nD\u03bc \u03c6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212\n\n1\nSU(3)\nigX AX\n\u03c6.\n\u03bc \u03c6 + igA\u03bc\n3\n\n(51)\n\nNote that the U (1)X generator commutes with SU (3), and the U (1)X gauge\ninteractions do not change any of the symmetry arguments which we used to\nshow that the Higgs mass is not quadratically divergent at one loop.\nThere are now three neutral gauge bosons, corresponding to the generators\nT 3 , T 8 , X. These gauge bosons mix, and the mass eigenstates are the photon,\nthe Z, and a Z \u2032 . The Z \u2032 leads to interesting modifications of predictions for\nprecision electroweak observables, as discussed in section 5.\n\n3.6\n\nQuartic Higgs coupling\n\nTo generate a quartic Higgs coupling we want to write a potential V (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) that\ni. contains no mass at order f for the Higgs, ii. contains a quartic coupling, iii.\npreserves the \"collective\" symmetry breaking of the SU (3)'s: i.e. the quartic\ncoupling is generated by at least two couplings in V , and if one sets either one\nof them to zero the Higgs becomes an exact NGB. This last property is what\nguarantees radiative stability, that is, no \u039b2 contributions to the Higgs mass.\nWriting down a potential which satisfies these properties appears to be impossible for the pure SU (3) model. To see why it is not straightforward, note\nthat \u03c6\u20201 \u03c62 is the only non-trivial gauge invariant which can be formed from \u03c61\nand \u03c62 . (\u03c6\u20201 \u03c61 = const = \u03c6\u20202 \u03c62 and \u01ebijk \u03c6i \u03c6j \u03c6k = 0). But the \u03c6\u20201 \u03c62 invariant is\na bad starting point because it breaks the two SU (3)'s to the diagonal, and it\n\n18\n\n\fis not surprising that generic functions of \u03c6\u20201 \u03c62 always contain a mass as well as\na quartic. For example, we have\n\u03c6\u20201 \u03c62 \u223c f 2 \u2212 h\u2020 h +\n\n1 \u2020 2\n(h h) + * * * ,\nf\n\n(52)\n\nso that\n1\n(\u03c6\u2020 \u03c62 )n \u223c f 4 \u2212 f 2 h\u2020 h + (h\u2020 h)2 + * * *\nf 2n\u22124 1\n\n(53)\n\nBy dialing the coefficient of this operator we can either get a small enough mass\nterm or a large enough quartic coupling but not both. Of course, we could\ntry to tune two terms with different powers n such that the mass terms cancel\nbetween them, but that tuning is not radiatively stable.\nThere are two different solutions to the problem in the literature. Both\nrequire enlarging the model and symmetry structure. One solution, due to\nKaplan and Schmaltz [20], involves enlarging the gauge symmetry to SU (4)\nand introducing four \u03c6 fields, each transforming as a 4 of SU (4). The four \u03c6\nfields break SU (4) \u2192 SU (2), yielding 4 SU (2) doublets. Two of them are eaten,\nand the other two are \"little Higgs\" fields with a quartic potential similar to the\nquartic potential in SUSY.\nThe other solution, due to Skiba and Terning [22], keeps the SU (3) gauge\nsymmetry the same but enlarges the global SU (3)2 symmetry to SU (3)3 , which\nis then embedded in an SU (9). The larger symmetry also leads to two \"little\"\nHiggs doublets for which a quartic coupling can be written. Both of these\nsolutions spoil some of the simplicity of the SU (3) model, but they allow a\nlarge quartic coupling for the Higgs fields with natural electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. We refer the reader to the original papers for details on these models.\nA third option [30] is simply to add a potential with a very small coefficient.\nThe resulting quartic coupling is then also very small, but as in the MSSM,\nradiative corrections from the top loop give a contribution that can raise the\nHiggs mass above the experimental bound of 114 GeV. Explicitly, below the\n\nh\nh\nh\nh\nFigure 7: The top loop contribution to the Higgs quartic coupling.\nT mass the cancellations in the top sector no longer occur and the diagram in\n19\n\n\fFigure 7 gives a quartic-term contribution\n3\u03bb4t\nm2T\nlog(\n) (h\u2020 h)2 ,\n16\u03c0 2\nm2t\n\n(54)\n\nwhich is too small by itself but does give successful electroweak symmetry breaking when combined with a small tree-level contribution. Since the tree-level\nterm also contributes to the Higgs mass-squared, a moderate amount of tuning\n(\u223c10%) is required. While this is not completely satisfactory, it is better than\nmost other models of electroweak symmetry breaking and certainly better than\nthe MSSM with gauge coupling unification, which requires tuning at the few %\nlevel or worse.\n\n3.7\n\nThe simplest little Higgs\n\nTo emphasize the simplicity of the model, we summarize the field content and\nLagrangian of the \"simplest little Higgs\" [30], the SU (3) model in which the\nHiggs quartic coupling is predominantly generated from the top loop.\nThe model has an SU (3)color \u00d7 SU (3)weak \u00d7 U (1)X gauge group with three\ngenerations transforming as\n\u03a8Q = (3, 3) 31\n\n\u03a8L = (1, 3)\u2212 31\n\nc\n\nd = (3\u0304, 1) 13\n\nec = (1, 1)1\n\n2 \u00d7 uc = (3\u0304, 1)\u2212 23\n\nnc = (1, 1)0\n\n(55)\n\nThe triplets \u03a8Q and \u03a8L contain the Standard Model quark and lepton doublets,\nthe singlets are uc , dc , ec , nc .3 The SU (3)weak \u00d7 U (1)X symmetry is broken by\nexpectation values for scalar fields \u03c61 = \u03c62 = (1, 3)\u22121/3 .\nThe Lagrangian of the model contains the usual kinetic terms, Yukawa couplings and a tree level Higgs potential\nLkin\n\n\u223c\n\n\u03a8Q\u2020 D\u03a8\n/ Q + * * * + |D\u03bc \u03c61 |2 + * * *\n\nLyuk\n\n\u223c\n\n\u03bbu1 \u03c6\u20201 \u03a8Q uc1 + \u03bbu2 \u03c6\u20202 \u03a8Q uc2 +\n+\u03bbn \u03c6\u20201 \u03a8L nc +\n\nLpot\n\n\u223c\n\n(56)\n\nd\n\n\u03bb\n\u03c61 \u03c62 \u03a8Q dc\nf\n\n\u03bbe\n\u03c61 \u03c62 \u03a8L ec\nf\n\n(57)\n\n\u03bc2 \u03c6\u20201 \u03c62 .\n\n(58)\n\nSubstituting the parametrization for the NGBs\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n0 0\n0\n0\nf1\nf2\n\u03b7\n1\n\u03c61 = ei\u0398 f1 \uf8ed 0 \uf8f8 , \u03c62 = e\u2212i\u0398 f2 \uf8ed 0 \uf8f8 , \u0398 = \u221a + \uf8ed 0 0\nf\n2f\nh\u2020\nf1\nf2\n\n\uf8f6\n\nh\uf8f8\n(59)\n0\n\n3 This fermion content is anomalous under the extended electroweak gauge group.

Taken together, the three models illustrate different approaches to implementing the little Higgs mechanism economically.\nFirst we describe the \"Minimal Moose\" model presented in Ref. [15]. The\ncoset on which this model is constructed bears some similarity to that of the\nchiral Lagrangian used to describe the low energy dynamics of QCD. In the case\nof QCD, an approximate SU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R chiral symmetry, which becomes\nexact in the limit of vanishing light quark masses, is spontaneously broken to\nits vector subgroup, so the coset is (SU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R )/SU (3)V . There is an\noctet of pseudo-NGB's associated with this spontaneous breaking, and these are\nunderstood to be the light mesons (\u03c0 0 , \u03c0 \u00b1 , K 0 , K\u0304 0 , K \u00b1 , \u03b7 0 ).\nThe coset used for the Minimal Moose is [SU (3)L \u00d7 SU (3)R /SU (3)V ]4 , so\ntheir are four sets of NGB octets that appear in four sigma fields \u03a3i , i = 1, 2, 3, 4.\nThe sigma fields transform under the global symmetries as\n\u03a3i \u2192 Li \u03a3i Ri\u2020 ,\n\n(60)\n\nwhere Li and Ri are SU (3) matrices. The sigma fields can be parametrized in\nterms of the NGB's \u03c0ia , as\na\n\u03a3i = e2i\u03c0i Ta /f ,\n(61)\nwhere the Ta are the generators of SU (3), normalized so that tr(Ta Tb ) = 12 \u03b4ab .\nThe idea is to identify some of these NGBs as Higgs doublets responsible for\nelectroweak symmetry breaking (this will turn out to be a two-Higgs-doublet\nmodel). As with the SU (3) model, the challenge will be to give these fields\ngauge interactions, Yukawa couplings to fermions, and self interactions, in such\na way that no quadratically divergent contributions to their masses squared\narise at one loop.\n4.1.1\n\nGauge Interactions\n\nIn this model, the electroweak group descends from a gauged SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7\nU (1) subgroup of the original SU (3)8 global symmetry. The sigma fields transform identically under this gauge group: under an SU (3) gauge transformation\nU and an SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) transformation V , we have\n\u03a3i \u2192 U \u03a3i V \u2020 .\n\n(62)\n\nHere, SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) gauge transformations are embedded in the 3 \u00d7 3 matrix\nV in such a way that the SU (2) transformation lives in the upper left 2 \u00d7 2\n21\n\n\f\u03a31\n\u03a32\nSU(3)\n\n\u03a33\n\nSU(2) X U(1)\n\n\u03a34\nFigure 8: The Minimal Moose.\nspace of V , while the gauged U (1) generator is proportional to diag(1, 1, \u22122).\nWe can take the Standard Model fermions to be charged under SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)\nwith their ordinary quantum numbers, and neutral under SU (3). Then to allow\nfor couplings between the sigma fields and fermions, described below, the first\ntwo columns of \u03a3 are assigned U (1) charge \u22121/6, while the last has charge 1/3.\nThe gauge structure of the model can be depicted by the diagram of Fig. (8),\nin which there are two \"sites\" corresponding to the SU (3) and SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)\ngauge groups, and \"links\" representing the sigma fields that transform under the\ngauge groups of both sites. The Standard Model fermions live on the SU (2) \u00d7\nU (1) site. A simple modification of this model is to have SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) gauge\ngroups at both sites, and we will return to this possibility in section 4.3.\nThe sigma fields spontaneously break the SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) gauge symmetry to SU (2)W \u00d7U (1)Y , where, as the subscripts suggest, the unbroken group\nis identified as the gauge symmetry of the standard electroweak theory. Similarly to what we did for the SU (3) theory, we can assemble the NGBs in each\nsigma field into a matrix and make their decomposition under SU (2)W \u00d7 U (1)Y\nmanifest:\n\u221a \u0013\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u03c6i + \u03b7i /(2 3) hi / 2\na a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n,\n(63)\n\u03c0i = \u03c0i T =\nh\u2020i / 2\n\u2212\u03b7i / 3\nwhere the real scalar \u03b7i is a singlet under SU (2)W \u00d7 U (1)Y , the real scalars\n\u03c6i = \u03c6ai \u03c3 a /2 transform as 30 , and the complex doublet hi transforms like the\nStandard Model Higgs, 21/2 , once we fix the normalization of U (1)Y charge\nappropriately.\nBy expanding the covariant derivatives in the kinetic terms of the non-linear\nsigma model,\n4\nf2 X\nLkin =\ntr[(D\u03bc \u03a3i )\u2020 (D\u03bc \u03a3i )],\n(64)\n4 i=1\none can calculate the masses of the octet of gauge bosons that\np become heavy\nwhen the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken: these\nare\ng32 + g22 f for an\np\nelectroweak triplet, g3 f for a pair of doublets, and g32 + g12 /3f for a singlet.\nHere g1 , g2 , and g3 are the SU (3), SU (2), and U (1) gauge couplings, which\n\n22\n\n\fdetermine the gauge couplings of the electroweak theory according to\ng\u2032\n\n=\n\ng\n\n=\n\ng1 g3\np\n2\ng3 + g12 /3\ng g\np 2 3 .\ng22 + g32\n\n(65)\n(66)\n\nAssuming that f \u223c TeV, we expect that the masses of these heavy gauge bosons\nwill be somewhere near the TeV scale.\nThe gauge couplings explicitly break the large SU (3)8 global symmetry that\nwe began with, and so the \u03c0ia fields are exact NGBs only in the limit of vanishing gauge couplings. The only global symmetry that remains exact when the\ncouplings are turned on is SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) itself, and the octet of NGBs\nassociated with the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry to SU (2)W \u00d7 U (1)Y\nis eaten: its members become the longitudinal components of the heavy gauge\nbosons. The eaten fields appear in the linear combination of \u03c0i 's that shifts\nunder SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) transformations associated with the broken generators. Because these transformations act identically on the various sigma fields,\nit is clear that \u03c01 + \u03c02 + \u03c03 + \u03c04 is the linear combination eaten (it shifts, while\nthe linear combinations orthogonal to it do not).\nThe uneaten NGBs acquire potentials from loops, but none receives quadratically divergent contributions to its mass at one loop. In the limit that g3 \u2192 0,\nan exact SU (3)4 \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) global symmetry is recovered. This is spontaneously broken to SU (2) \u00d7 U (1), ensuring a total of four exactly massless octets\nof NGBs (including the ones eaten). If instead g2 and g1 are turned off, an\nSU (3)5 global symmetry is recovered. This is spontaneously broken to SU (3),\nso all of the NGBs are massless once again. Only when g3 and at least one of g1\nand g2 are turned on can these fields acquire mass, so a one-loop contribution\nto their masses must involve both g3 and g2 , or both g3 and g1 . Contributions\nof this sort are at most logarithmically divergent.\nThe absence of one-loop quadratic divergences depends crucially on the enlarged gauge symmetry. If only the diagonal SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) is gauged, then there\nare no global symmetries to protect the masses of the scalars, and so they receive\nquadratically divergent contributions at one loop. This is not surprising given\nthat, in this case, there are no extra particles around to cut off the divergences\nfrom ordinary gauge loops. Once the extra SU (3) is gauged, the heavy gauge\nbosons associated with the spontaneous breaking down to SU (2)W \u00d7 U (1)Y\nappear in one-loop diagrams whose quadratic divergences cancel those from\ndiagrams with massless gauge bosons running the loops.\n4.1.2\n\nThe Quartic Coupling\n\nA quartic coupling for the Higgs doublets can be generated by adding the following terms to the Lagrangian:\n\u0012 \u00134\n\u0012 \u00134\nf\nf\n\u2020\n\u2020\nL\u03a3 =\ntr(c1 \u03a31 \u03a32 \u03a33 \u03a34 ) +\ntr(c2 \u03a31 \u03a3\u20204 \u03a33 \u03a3\u20202 ) + h.c.,\n(67)\n2\n2\n23\n\n\fwhere for now we can imagine that c1 and c2 are numbers of order unity, which\nwe take to be real for simplicity. Precisely where these operators come from is\nan interesting question, but there is no need to specify their ultraviolet origin\nto work out their consequences in the effective theory. In [15] it was shown\nthat a particular arrangement of couplings of the sigma fields to fermions does\ngenerate these operators.\nLet's consider the effects of L\u03a3 , forgetting for the moment about the gauge\ncouplings. If only c1 , and not c2 , is turned on, the original SU (3)8 global\nsymmetry is explicitly broken to SU (3)4 : only those transformations satisfying\nR1 = R2 , R3 = R4 , L1 = L4 , and L2 = L3 leave L\u03a3 invariant. This SU (3)4\nglobal symmetry is spontaneously broken to SU (3) by the sigma fields, giving\nthree octets of of massless NGBs, one of which is eaten. Since we started out\nwith four octets, we expect c1 to give a potential to one of them.\nIt is useful to define the linear combinations\nx =\ny\n\n=\n\nz\n\n=\n\n1\n\u221a (\u03c01 \u2212 \u03c03 )\n2\n1\n\u221a (\u03c02 \u2212 \u03c04 )\n2\n1\n(\u03c01 \u2212 \u03c02 + \u03c03 \u2212 \u03c04 ),\n2\n\n(68)\n(69)\n(70)\n\nand set the fourth linear combination, the eaten one, to zero. The field z is\nthe linear combination that does not shift under any SU (3)4 transformation\npreserved by c1 . \u221aFor instance, under infinitesimal\nsymmetry transformations\n\u221a\nR1 = R2 = 1 \u2212 2 2i\u03b1/f and L1 = L4 = 1 + 2 2i\u03b2/f , the changes in the fields\nare\n\u03b4x\n\u03b4y\n\u03b4z\n\n= \u03b1 + \u03b2 + ***\n\n= \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 + ***\ni\n([\u03b1 + \u03b2, y] \u2212 [\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2, x]) + * * * ,\n=\n2f\n\n(71)\n\nwhere terms of order x2 , y 2 , and z have been neglected. Both x and y shift,\nwhich tells us that no potential can be generated for them. On the other hand, z\ndoes not transform at zeroth order in the fields, and so it can acquire a potential.\nExpanding L\u03a3 for c2 = 0, we find\n\u0012\n\u00132\ni\n2\nL\u03a3 = \u2212c1 f tr z \u2212\n[x, y] + * * * ,\n(72)\n2f\nwhere we have kept terms only up to order z, x4 , and y 4 in the interactions (it is\neasy to check that this expression is indeed invariant under the transformations\nof Eqn. (71)). As anticipated, only the z octet acquires a mass-squared \u223c c1 f 2 ,\nwhile x and y remain massless. In fact, after integrating out the z octet, the\npotential for x and y vanishes completely: there is an exact cancellation between\nthe tr[x, y]2 term already in Eqn. (72), and an identical term generated by the\n24\n\n\ftr(z[x, y]) coupling through exchange of the heavy z octet. This is all as it must\nbe based on the symmetry considerations above.\nWhen both c1 and c2 are turned on, we have\n\u00132\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0012\ni\ni\n[x, y] \u2212 c2 f 2 tr z +\n[x, y] .\nL\u03a3 = \u2212c1 f 2 tr z \u2212\n(73)\n2f\n2f\nThe crucial sign difference in the second term relative to the first arises because\nthe two terms in L\u03a3 are related by \u03a32 \u2194 \u03a34 , which amounts to \u03c02 \u2194 \u03c04 , or\ny \u2192 \u2212y, with x and z left invariant. Because of this sign difference, it is no\nlonger true that the potential for x and y vanishes once z is integrated out. This\nmakes sense: once c1 and c2 are both turned on, only a global SU (3)2 symmetry\nis preserved, with each L the same and each R the same, and the only massless\nNGBs associated with the spontaneous breaking of this SU (3)2 to SU (3) are\nthe eaten ones. Thus, neither x nor y are exact NGBs once c1 and c2 are both\nturned on, and a potential for them is possible at tree level.\nIn particular, after integrating out z we find the quartic term\nLquartic =\n\nc1 c2\ntr[x, y]2 .\nc1 + c2\n\n(74)\n\nBecause this term arises from an interplay between the c1 and c2 couplings, it\nvanishes if either is turned off. The tree-level potential produced for x and y\ndoes not include mass terms, because neither c1 nor c2 can give mass to x or\ny by themselves, and there is no tree-level diagram with intermediate z that\ngenerates mass terms. Nor do the masses of the x and y fields receive quadratically divergent contributions at one loop, as there is no one-loop quadratically\ndivergent diagram involving both c1 and c2 . So the setup described here generates a tree-level quartic coupling for our pseudo-NGBs while keeping their\nmasses-squared loop-suppressed relative to f 2 . This is exactly what we want: if\nthe quartic coupling suffered the same loop suppression as the mass terms, the\nhierarchy between f and v could not be realized without fine tuning.\nNote that this mechanism of generating a tree-level quartic term for the\nNGBs while protecting their masses would not work with fewer than four sigma\nfields. For example, if we try using just three, and write down\n\u0012 \u00134\n\u0012 \u00134\nf\nf\ntr(c1 \u03a31 \u03a3\u20202 \u03a31 \u03a3\u20203 ) +\ntr(c2 \u03a31 \u03a3\u20203 \u03a31 \u03a3\u20202 ) + h.c.\n(75)\nL\u03a3 =\n2\n2\nto generate a quartic coupling, we find that c1 by itself breaks the global symmetry down to SU (3)2 . When this is spontaneously broken to SU (3), it yields\nonly the single of octet of massless NGBs that is eaten.\n4.1.3\n\nThe Top Yukawa Coupling\n\nWe demand that the top Yukawa coupling arises in such a way that no quadratically divergent contributions to the masses-squared of the Higgs doublets are\ninduced, and the strategy will again be to ensure that each coupling preserves\n25\n\n\fenough global symmetry to protect these masses. The Standard Model fermions\nare not charged under SU (3), so coupling the sigma fields to them requires us\nto work with SU (3)-singlet combinations, such as \u03a3T1 \u03a3\u22172 . Now consider the\nLagrangian terms\n\u0001\nLt = \u03bbf 0 0 uc3 \u2032 \u03a3T1 \u03a3\u22172 \u03c7 + \u03bb\u2032 f U c U + h.c.\n(76)\n\nHere, the third-generation electroweak-doublet and singlet quarks q3 = (u3 , d3 )\nand uc3 \u2032 are joined by an extra vector-like electroweak-singlet quark (U, U c ),\nand we have grouped some of these fermions into a triplet \u03c7 = (d3 , \u2212u3 , U ) (the\nordering of d3 and u3 in \u03c7 is appropriate because it ensures that an SU (2)W\ntransformation V , which sends h \u2192 V h, acts on the upper two components of\n\u03c7 as \u03c7 \u2192 V \u2217 \u03c7, as required for Lt to be gauge invariant).\nAs we will see shortly, these terms generate a Yukawa coupling for the top\nquark. Moreover, they do so without generating quadratically divergent contributions to the x and y masses-squared at one loop, as can be seen by an\nargument similar to that used in discussing the top Yukawa coupling in the\nSU (3) model: in the absence of \u03bb\u2032 , the term with coefficient Lt has an SU (3)\nglobal symmetry under which \u03c7 transforms as a triplet, and this symmetry prevents x and y from acquiring mass. So both couplings are required to generate\nmasses for x and y, and the rephasing symmetries of Lt indicate that these\ncouplings must appear as |\u03bb|2 and |\u03bb\u2032 |2 in any radiatively generated operators\ninvolving only \u03a3. Thus any one-loop diagram that contributes to the x and y\nmasses must involve four coupling constants, and can be at most logarithmically\ndivergent.\nThe absence of quadratic divergences can also be verify explicitly, using the\nColeman-Weinberg potential. At one loop, the effective potential generated for\nx and y by fermion loops can be calculated by turning on background values\nfor the sigma fields, and calculating the fermion mass matrix M (\u03a3) in this\nbackground. The quadratically divergent piece of the effective potential is then\nproportional to trM (\u03a3)\u2020 M (\u03a3). In our case, we have\n\u0001\n(77)\nLt = 0 0 uc3 \u2032 U c M (\u03a3)\u03c7 + h.c.,\nwhere the mass matrix M (\u03a3) has the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bbf \u03a3T1 \u03a3\u22172\nM (\u03a3) = P\n,\n0 0 \u03bb\u2032 f\n\n(78)\n\nwith P = diag(0, 0, 1, 1). The unitarity of the \u03a3's and the cyclic property of the\ntrace then leads to\ntrM (\u03a3)\u2020 M (\u03a3) = f 2 (|\u03bb|2 + |\u03bb\u2032 |2 ).\n\n(79)\n\nThere is no dependence on x or y, and so as expected, no quadratically divergent\ncontributions to their masses at one loop. This technique also allows one to check\nexplicitly that the gauge interactions and L\u03a3 do not generate quadratically\ndivergent contributions at one loop either; see [15] for details.\n26\n\n\fTo explore the coupling of the light scalars to fermions, we expand x and y\nin terms of hx,y , \u03b7x,y , and \u03c6x,y as in Eqn. (63), and find that Lt includes the\nterms\n\u03bb\u2032 f U c U + \u03bbf uc3 \u2032 U + i\u03bbuc3 q3 (hx \u2212 hy ) + h.c.\n(80)\nc\u2032\nc\nOne linear\np combination of u3 and U marries U to make ac Dirac fermion with\n2\n\u2032\n2\nmass f |\u03bb| + |\u03bb | , while the orthogonal combination, u3 , is massless in the\nabsence of electroweak symmetry breaking. Integrating out the heavy fermion,\nwe are left with the Yukawa coupling\n\u221a\n(81)\n\u03bbt uc3 q3 (hx \u2212 hy )/ 2,\n\nwhere the coefficient is\n\n\u221a\n2\u03bb\u03bb\u2032\n\n\u03bbt = p\n.\n|\u03bb|2 + |\u03bb\u2032 |2\n\n(82)\n\nThus an unsuppressed top Yukawa coupling is generated, without quadratically\ndivergent contributions to the Higgs mass at one loop. The Yukawa couplings\nfor the remaining Standard Model fermions are small enough that their quadratically divergent contributions to the Higgs mass-squared are numerically unimportant for the relatively low cut-off \u039b \u223c 10 TeV we have in mind. This means\nthat to give masses to these fermions, we are free to write down couplings similar to the first term in Eqn. (76), except without introducing extra vector-like\nfermions analogous to (U, U c ).\nNote that Lt breaks the original SU (3)8 global symmetry to SU (3)5 \u00d7\n[SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]2 , which is spontaneously broken to SU (3)2 \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1),\ngiving three full octets of massless NGBs plus one (\u03b7, \u03c6) set. One full octet is\neaten, and another becomes massive at tree level due to L\u03a3 , leaving a full octet\nplus an additional (\u03b7, \u03c6) set as light fields that acquire no potential due to Lt .\nThis tells us that of the fields x and y, top loops contribute to the mass of only\none combination of Higgs doublets (hx \u2212 hy ), and do not contribute to any \u03b7 or\n\u03c6's masses.\n4.1.4\n\nElectroweak Symmetry Breaking\n\nAll of the light scalars in x and y receive positive contributions to their massessquared once one-loop contributions induced by L\u03a3 and gauge interactions are\ntaken into account. As just discussed, the triplets and singlets do not receive\ncontributions to their potentials due to Lt , but the linear combination hx \u2212 hy\ndoes receive a one-loop contribution to its mass from the coupling to fermions,\nand this contribution is negative. It is possible that this negative contribution is\nlarge enough to force a vev for hx \u2212 hy , causing electroweak symmetry breaking.\nTo address the important question of the stability of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, let us expand the quartic coupling of Eqn. (74) in terms of the Higgs\ndoublets. We find\n\u0001\nc1 c2\n(h\u2020x hy \u2212 h\u2020y hx )2 + tr(hy h\u2020x \u2212 hx h\u2020y )2 ,\n(83)\nLquartic =\n4(c1 + c2 )\n27\n\n\f\u221a\nwhere we've set \u03b7x,y and\n\u221a \u03c6x,y to zero. Defining new doublets h1 = (hy \u2212ihx )/ 2\nand h2 = (hx \u2212 ihy )/ 2, these terms become\n\u0011\n\u0010\nc1 c2\nLquartic = \u2212\n(84)\n(h\u20201 h1 \u2212 h\u20202 h2 )2 + tr(h1 h\u20201 \u2212 h2 h\u20202 )2 ,\n4(c1 + c2 )\nwhich, when restricted to neutral components, has the same form as the quartic\npotential of the supersymmetric Standard Model. This quartic potential has a\nflat direction along h1 = h2 , which must be stabilized by the quadratic terms\nin the potential. These are of the form m21 (|hx |2 + |hy |2 ) + m22 |hx \u2212 hy |2 , where\nm22 < 0 comes from top loops. Written in terms of h1 and h2 , the quadratic\nterms become\n(m21 + m22 )(|h1 |2 + |h2 |2 ) + m22 (h\u20201 h2 + h\u20202 h1 ).\n\n(85)\n\nNow, for electroweak symmetry to occur at all, we need the origin to be unstable,\nwhich requires\n(m21 + m22 )2 \u2212 (m22 )2 < 0.\n(86)\n\nBecause m22 is negative, this condition is easily satisfied. But if it is satisfied,\nthen the quadratic terms in the potential do not stabilize the h1 = h2 flat\ndirection, and the potential is unbounded from below.\nThis means that the sigma field couplings of Eqn. (67) need to be modified.\nThe modification suggested in [15] is to give a non-trivial matrix structure to\nthe couplings c1 and c2 : c1 \u2192 c1 I + \u01eb1 T8 and c2 \u2192 c2 I + \u01eb2 T8 . The coupling\n\u01eb1 breaks the global symmetry of the term with coefficient c1 from SU (3)4 to\nSU (2) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 SU (3)3 . It is true that, since this global symmetry is spontaneously broken to SU (2) \u00d7 U (1), the \u01eb1 term by itself would still leave three\nmassless octets of NGBs. The point, though, is that the three octets protected\nwhen c1 alone is turned on are not exactly the same as the three octets protected when \u01eb1 alone is turned on, and when both are turned on, some of the\nstates contained in x and y acquire mass. By explicit calculation, one finds the\nLagrangian term\n\u221a\n3 2\nf I(\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb2 )i(h\u2020y hx \u2212 h\u2020x hy ),\n(87)\n8\nwhich is proportional to |h1 |2 \u2212 |h2 |2 . Now that the masses-squared for h1 and\nh2 are split, it is possible to have stable electroweak symmetry breaking. For\nthis term to have the right size, I(\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb2 ) should be small, \u223c 10\u22122 . However,\nsince \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 encode the effects of additional sources of symmetry breaking,\nit is natural for them to be suppressed.\nTo summarize, the Minimal Moose has two Higgs doublets in its scalar sector,\nalong with a complex triplet and a complex singlet, all with masses near the weak\nscale. Around the TeV scale, there is an additional octet of scalars, along with an\nelectroweak-singlet vector-like quark, and an octet of heavy gauge bosons. This\nparticle content is sufficient for cutting off the one-loop quadratic divergences\nassociated with the Higgs doublets' gauge, Yukawa, and self couplings at around\nthe TeV scale.\n28\n\n\f4.2\n\nThe Littlest Higgs\n\nThe third and final model that we will discuss in detail is the \"Littlest Higgs\"\nmodel of Ref. [16], which is constructed using an SU (5)/SO(5) coset. We can\nimagine that the SU (5) global symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation\nvalue of a scalar \u03a3 transforming as a two-index symmetric tensor, or 15 of\nSU (5). Let's take this vev to have the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n11\n\uf8f8,\n1\nh\u03a3i = \uf8ed\n(88)\n11\n\nwhere 11 is the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix, and entries left blank vanish. Under an\nSU(5) transformation U = ei\u03b8a Ta , we have \u03a3 \u2192 U \u03a3U T , which means that the\nten unbroken generators satisfy\nT\n\nT a h\u03a3i + h\u03a3iT a\n\n=\n\n0.\n\n(unbroken)\n\n(89)\n\nThese are the 10 generators of SO(5). The 14 remaining broken generators\nsatisfy\nT\u0302a h\u03a3i \u2212 h\u03a3iT\u0302aT\n\n= 0,\n\n(broken)\n\n(90)\n\nand in constructing the non-linear sigma model, we keep only the fluctuations\nof \u03a3 around its vev in these broken directions:\nT\n\n\u03a3 = ei\u03c0a T\u0302a /f h\u03a3iei\u03c0a T\u0302a /f = e2i\u03c0a T\u0302a /f h\u03a3i,\n\n(91)\n\nwhere the last equality follows from Eqn. (90).\nIt is straightforward to show that, in light of Eqn. (90), the matrix of NGBs\nmay be written as\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03c7 + \u03b7/(2\n5) h\u2217 / \u221a2\n\u03c6\u2020\u221a\n\u221a\n(92)\n\u03c0 = \u03c0a T\u0302a = \uf8ed\nhT / 2\n\u22122\u03b7/\nh\u2020 / 2\u221a \uf8f8 ,\n\u221a 5\nT\n\u03c6\nh/ 2\n\u03c7 + \u03b7/(2 5)\nwhere \u03c7 = \u03c7a \u03c3 a /2 is a Hermitian, traceless 2 \u00d7 2 matrix, \u03b7 is a real singlet, h is\na complex doublet, and \u03c6 is a 2 \u00d7 2 symmetric matrix. The various coefficients\nare chosen so that the kinetic term of the non-linear sigma model,\nLkin =\n\nf2\ntr[(D\u03bc \u03a3)\u2020 (D\u03bc \u03a3)].\n8\n\n(93)\n\nyields canonically normalized kinetic terms for the NGBs.\n4.2.1\n\nGauge Interactions\n\nAs was done in the previous models, we now gauge a subgroup of the global\nsymmetry, and as before, we do this in such a way that each gauge coupling by\n29\n\n\fitself preserves enough of the global symmetry to ensure that the Higgs doublet\n(a single doublet in this model) remains an exact NGB. The gauge group is\ntaken to be [SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]2 , embedded in SU (5) in such that the the gauged\ngenerators for the two SU (2)'s are\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212\u03c3 a\u2217 /2\na\na\nQ1 =\nand\nQ2 =\n, (94)\n\u03c3 a /2\nso the first SU (2) acts on the first two indices, and the second acts on the last\ntwo. The gauged generators for the two U (1)'s are Y1 = diag(\u22123, \u22123, 2, 2, 2)/10\nand Y2 = diag(\u22122, \u22122, \u22122, 3, 3)/10, respectively. Because the trace of the\nproduct of these generators is non-vanishing, kinetic mixing between the two\nU (1) gauge bosons will arise at loop level. Re-diagonalizing the gauge kinetic terms modifies the couplings of the W and Z to fermions. But aside\nfrom unobservable re-scalings of gauge couplings, physical effects of the kinetic mixing vanish in the limit of unbroken standard model gauge symmetry.\nTherefore contributions to precision electroweak observables are suppressed by\n1/(16\u03c0 2 )(MZ /MZ \u2032 )2 \u223c 10\u22124 , evading all constraints.\nThe linear combination Qa1 + Qa2 satisfies Eqn. (89), and generates the unbroken symmetry that we identify as SU (2)W of the Standard Model. Similarly,\nthe linear combination Y1 + Y2 also satisfies Eqn. (89), and generates the unbroken symmetry that we identify as U (1)Y . The orthogonal combinations are\nbroken, and by expanding Lkin one can check that the heavyq\nSU (2) and U (1)\np\n2\n2\ngauge bosons have masses MW \u2032 = f g1 + g2 /2 and MB \u2032 = f (g1\u2032 2 + g2\u2032 2 )/20,\nrespectively. Here g1 and g2 are the gauge couplings of the two SU (2)'s, and g1\u2032\nand g2\u2032 are the gauge couplings of the two U (1)'s. These determine the Standard\nModel gauge couplings\ng\n\n=\n\ng\u2032\n\n=\n\ng1 g2\np\ng12 + g22\ng\u2032 g\u2032\nq 1 2\n,\ng1\u2032 2 + g2\u2032 2\n\n(95)\n(96)\n\nwhere the U (1) charge is normalized so that Y = 1/2 for the doublet h (i.e. Y =\nY1 + Y2 ). Note that the mass of the B \u2032 is somewhat suppressed. As discussed in\nsection 5, the effects of this particle modify MW /MZ and the couplings of the Z\nto fermions, so the relative smallness of mB \u2032 /f leads to important constraints\non the model.\nWhen [SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]2 is broken to its diagonal subgroup, the \u03b7 and \u03c7 fields\nof the \u03c0 matrix in Eqn. (92) are eaten, leaving only h and \u03c6, which transform as\n21/2 and 31 under SU (2)W \u00d7 U (1)Y . What can we say about the potential for\nthese fields generated by gauge loops? Let's first imagine that all of the gauge\ncouplings vanish, except for g2 . In this case, the original SU (5) global symmetry\nis explicitly broken to SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1), where the SU (3) acts on the first\nthree indices, and the SU (2) acts on the last two. This is spontaneously broken\nto the SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) of the electroweak group, and so in this limit, there are\n30\n\n\feight NGBs: these include the four that are eaten when the full [SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]2\nis gauged, and the four that make up the Higgs doublet h. The Higgs doublet h\nshifts under part of the SU (3), and so its forbidden from picking up a potential.\nThe six real scalars in \u03c6, on the other hand, are not protected by the global\nsymmetry and are allowed to pick up a potential. The same symmetry argument\napplies when only g2\u2032 is turned on. Finally, when g1 or g1\u2032 are turned on, a\ndifferent SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) is preserved (this time with the SU (3) acting\non the last three indices), and this symmetry is also enough to keep the Higgs\nmassless. The fact that more than one coupling is required to break enough\nof the global symmetry to let h acquire a potential tells us that even when\nall couplings are turned on, the Higgs does not receive quadratically divergent\ncontributions to its mass-squared at one loop.\nOn the other hand, \u03c6 does pick up a quadratically divergent mass squared at\none loop, and after integrating \u03c6 out, a tree-level quartic potential is generated\nfor h. This is very similar to what happened in the Minimal Moose model with\nthe introduction of L\u03a3 , except that in the present model, no extra terms for \u03a3 are\nrequired: the gauge interactions by themselves generate a quartic coupling for\nthe Higgs. This can be verified by studying the quadratically divergent piece of\nthe Coleman-Weinberg potential, V = \u039b2 trM 2 (\u03a3)/(16\u03c0 2 ) \u223c f 2 trM 2 (\u03a3), where\ntrM 2 (\u03a3) is the trace of the gauge boson mass-squared matrix in the presence\nof a background value for \u03a3. It is calculated from Lkin as\n!\nX\nf2 X\n2\n\u20322\n\u2020\n\u2217\n2\na\n\u2217\na\ntrM (\u03a3) =\ng tr[(\u03a3 Yi ) (\u03a3Yi )] + gi\ntr[(Qi \u03a3) (Qi \u03a3)] , (97)\n2 i=1,2 i\na\nwhere terms that do not depend on \u03a3 have been dropped. Expanding this\nexpression gives\n2\n\n2\n\ntrM 2 (\u03a3) = (g12 + g1\u2032 )tr(K\u2212 \u2020 K\u2212 ) + (g22 + g2\u2032 )tr(K+ \u2020 K+ ) + * * * ,\n\n(98)\n\nwhere K\u00b1 = \u03c6 \u00b1 2fi hhT . As claimed, \u03c6 picks up a quadratically divergent mass\nsquared at one loop, but h does not. In fact, the potential for h vanishes entirely\nonce \u03c6 is integrated out if only the first term is present, or only the second term.\nIn the presence of both terms, however, integrating out \u03c6 generates the quartic\nterm\n2\n2\n(g 2 + g1\u2032 )(g22 + g2\u2032 )\n|hh\u2020 |2 ,\n(99)\nLquartic = \u2212c 21\n2\ng1 + g1\u2032 + g22 + g2\u2032 2\nwhere c is a coefficient of order unity that encodes the details of how the\nquadratic divergences are cut off in the full UV-completed theory.\n4.2.2\n\nThe Top Yukawa Coupling\n\nIn this model, there are a number of approaches to generating a top Yukawa\ncoupling while protecting the Higgs mass. Here we describe a setup that introduces the minimal number of additional fermions. To avoid generating\nquadratically divergent contributions to the Higgs mass-squared at one loop,\n31\n\n\fwe require that the coupling of the top quark to \u03a3 respect one of the SU (3)\nglobal symmetries under which h shifts. Suppose that we take the third generation quark doublet q3 = (u3 , d3 ) to transform under SU (2)1 . Then to achieve\nan SU (3)-symmetric coupling, we proceed as we did for the Minimal Moose:\nwe add an extra electroweak-singlet vector-like fermion (U, U c ), form a triplet\n\u03c7 = (d3 , \u2212u3 , U ), and couple this triplet to \u03a3 and the electroweak singlet uc3 \u2032\nan an SU (3)-symmetric fashion.\nConsider the Lagrangian terms\nLt = \u03bbf \u01ebijk \u03c7i \u03a3j4 \u03a3k5 uc3 \u2032 + \u03bb\u2032 f U U c + h.c.\n\n(100)\n\nThe indices i, j, k run over the values 1, 2, 3, so the first term is an SU (3)invariant antisymmetric contraction of three triplets. It is also invariant under\nthe gauged SU (2)2 , as required: for each i and j, the combination \u03a3i4 \u03a3j5 \u2212\n\u03a3i5 \u03a3j4 appears after the sum is carried out, and this is an SU (2)2 -invariant\nantisymmetric contraction of two doublets. The U (1)1 \u00d7 U (2)2 charges of the\nfermions are chosen so that the above terms are neutral. For example, if we take\n(1/6, 0) to be the charges of q3 , then we have uc3 \u2032 (\u22127/15, \u22121/5) and U (2/3, 0).\nAnomalies associated with the broken generators of the extended gauge group\nare assumed to be canceled by heavy fermions.\nIn the presence of \u03bb alone, a linear combination of u3 and U remains massless\neven after electroweak symmetry breaking, but the second term makes this mode\nheavy. When we expand Lt we find\n\u221a\nLt = i 2\u03bbq3 huc3 \u2032 + f U (\u03bbuc3 \u2032 + \u03bb\u2032 U c ) + h.c.,\n(101)\nwhere we have only kept terms up to linear order in h. Inspection of the second\nterm shows that U marriespa linear combination of uc3 \u2032 and U c to become a\nDirac particle with mass f |\u03bb|2 + |\u03bb\u2032 |2 . Once this particle is integrated out,\nthe orthogonal linear combination, uc3 , appears in the Yukawa coupling\n\u221a\n2\u03bb\u03bb\u2032\nLt = p\nq3 huc3 + h.c.\n(102)\n|\u03bb|2 + |\u03bb\u2032 |2\n\nAs discussed earlier, the Yukawa couplings for the remaining Standard Model\nfermions are small enough that we needn't worry about the quadratic divergences they generate. We can produce these couplings by writing down terms\nsimilar to the first term in Eqn. (100), except without introducing extra vectorlike fermions analogous to (U, U c ).\nWe can verify that the couplings in Lt do not generate quadratically divergent contributions to the Higgs mass-squared at one loop by calculating\nthe quadratically divergent piece of the Coleman-Weinberg potential. Defining\n\u03c6i = \u01ebijk \u03a3j4 \u03a3k5 , the fermion mass matrix in a \u03a3 background is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03bb\u03c61 0\nM (\u03a3) = f \uf8ed \u03bb\u03c62 0 \uf8f8 .\n(103)\n\u03bb\u03c63 \u03bb\u2032\n32\n\n\fThe quadratically divergent piece of the Coleman-Weinberg potential is then\nproportional to\nX\n(104)\n|\u03c6i |2 + |\u03bb\u2032 |2 ) = \u2212|\u03bb|2 tr(K\u2212 \u2020 K\u2212 ),\ntrM (\u03a3)\u2020 M (\u03a3) = f 2 (|\u03bb|2\ni\n\nwhere for the last equality we have kept only terms up to order \u03c62 and h4 . This\nterm has the same form as the second term in Eqn. (98), which should come\nas no surprise given that \u03bb and g2 respect the same global symmetry. When\nwe integrate out \u03c6, the contributions to the potential arising from Eqn. (104)\nwill modify the quartic coupling obtained in Eqn. (99): in the end, the quartic\ncoupling depends on unknown order-one coefficients that are dependent on UV\nphysics, along with the gauge couplings and \u03bb.\nAlthough Lt does not generate a quadratically divergent contribution to the\nHiggs mass-squared at one loop, it does generate a logarithmically divergent\ncontribution at this level. Moreover, this contribution is negative, and if its\nmagnitude is sufficient large, it can overcome the positive contributions from\ngauge and self-interactions and cause electroweak symmetry breaking.\nWe have seen that the SU (5)/SO(5) coset allows for a very economical\nimplementation of the Little Higgs mechanism. In this model, the Higgs doublet\nof the Standard Model is the only anomalously light pseudo-NGB. The other\nscalars, which form an electroweak triplet, have a mass \u223c f \u223c TeV. The other\nnew states with masses around this scale are one electroweak-singlet vector-like\nquark (for the model of the top Yukawa coupling presented here), and weaktriplet and singlet heavy gauge bosons. An especially interesting feature of\nthis model is that the gauge interactions of the non-linear sigma field are by\nthemselves sufficient for generating a quartic coupling for the Higgs doublet.\n\n4.3\n\nOther Models\n\nIn the next section we will discuss various effects that give rise to precision\nelectroweak constraints on little Higgs theories. An order-v 2 /f 2 modification of\nMW /MZ arises from tree-level exchange of the heavy electroweak-singlet gauge\nboson. Depending on the theory, corrections to MW /MZ may also come from a\ntriplet VEV, or from dimension-six operators in the expansion of the non-linear\nsigma model kinetic term. Finally, integrating out the heavy gauge bosons also\nmodifies the couplings of the light Standard Model gauge bosons to fermions\nand generates four-fermion operators in the effective theory. Since these effects impose serious constraints on the models described so far, we now briefly\ndescribe alternative models in which the constraints are less severe.\n4.3.1\n\nLosing the Triplet\n\nA variation of the Littlest Higgs model based on the coset SU (6)/Sp(6) was\nconstructed in Ref. [18]. This breaking pattern gives rise to fourteen NGBs: four\nare eaten due to the gauge symmetry breaking [SU (2)\u00d7U (1)]2 \u2192 SU (2)\u00d7U (1),\n8 appear in two Higgs doublets, and 2 appear in a neutral complex singlet.\n33\n\n\fThe singlet's mass-squared receives quadratically divergent contributions at one\nloop, while the doublets remain light, and integrating out the singlet generates\na quartic coupling for the Higgs doublets. Having a extra singlet instead of an\nextra triplet allows for smaller values of f , as discussed in the following section.\n4.3.2\n\nModels with Custodial Symmetry\n\nConsider the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix \u03a3, whose first column is i\u03c32 h\u22c6 , and whose second\ncolumn is h. In the limit of vanishing gauge couplings, the Standard Model\nHiggs sector is invariant under\n\u03a3 \u2192 L\u03a3R\u2020 ,\n\n(105)\n\nwhere L and R and are independent SU (2) global symmetry transformations.\nThe group SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R is broken to the diagonal subgroup by the Higgs\nVEV h\u03a3i \u221d 1, and the unbroken group is called custodial symmetry, or SU (2)C .\nUnder SU (2)C , the three NGBs from \u03a3 transform as a triplet. These become\nthe longitudinal components of the W \u00b1 and Z. When the Standard Model\ngauge couplings are turned on, the Higgs doublet couples to the SU (2)W gauge\nfields through currents j\u03bca , and these transform as a triplet under SU (2)C just\nas the NGBs do. The fact that SU (2)C breaking in the Higgs and gauge boson\nsectors arises only from the hypercharge gauge coupling leads to the tree-level\nrelation MW = MZ cos \u03b8.\nGiven a modified Higgs sector, there is no guarantee that this relation will be\npreserved, unless there is an unbroken custodial SU (2) under which the NGB's\nand the SU (2)W currents both transform as triplets. The heavy U (1) gauge\nbosons in little Higgs models couple as TR3 , that is, in an SU (2)C -violating fashion, and integrating out these particles out generates dangerous operators such\nas (h\u2020 D\u03bc h)2 . Violation of SU (2)C also may arise from higher-order terms in the\nnon-linear sigma model kinetic term. Although these effects are typically quite\nconstraining, they can be minimized by building SU (2)C in as an approximate\nsymmetry of the theory, as was done in Refs. [21, 23].\nRef. [21] presented a modification of the Minimal Moose in which the SU (3)\nglobal symmetries are replaced by SO(5) global symmetries, and the SU (3) \u00d7\nSU (2) \u00d7 U (1) gauge group is replaced by SO(5) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1). The SO(5)\nglobal symmetry is large enough to contain SU (2)C , so the SU (2)C -violating\ncontributions from the non-linear sigma model structure are automatically absent. The SU (2)C violating contributions from exchange of the heavy U (1)\ngauge boson are partially canceled because this particle is now joined by other\nheavy gauge bosons with which it forms a triplet of SU (2)C . In the limit where\nthe SO(5) gauge coupling becomes large, these states become nearly degenerate, which suppresses the SU (2)C -violating effects produced when the triplet is\nintegrated out.\nOne complication is that the model has two Higgs doublets, with a potential\nthat requires their VEVs to be misaligned. This misalignment is its own source\nof SU (2)C violation, so that even when the triplet becomes degenerate, integrating it out still yields an SU (2)C -violating term. In Ref [23], this complication\n34\n\n\f(a)1111\n00\n0000 11\n00\n11\n\n1111 11\n0000\n00\n0000\n1111\n00\n11\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n00\n11\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n11111\n00000\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n0\n1\n0000\n1111\n0\n1\n0000\n1111\n0\n0000 1\n1111\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n(b)1111\n1111\n0000\n00\n11\n0000\n0000 1010\n1111\n00\n0000 11\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0\n1\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0\n1\n00\n11\n1111111\n0000000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n00\n11\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n1111\n0000\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n00000\n11111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n00000\n0000000\n1111111\n00\n11\n0000000\n1111111\n10 11111\n000\n111\n0000000\n1111111\n00\n11\n1010\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00\n10\n000 11\n111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\n111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n00000\n0000000\n1111111\n000 11111\n111\n00000\n11111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1010 1111\n0000000\n1111111\n0000\n1111\n0000000\n1111111\n1010\n10\n\nFigure 9: (a) Tree-level exchange of T-odd particles is forbidden.

With this symmetry in place, no effective operators involving just light fields are generated by tree-level exchange of heavy\nfields, because an even number of heavy fields are required at each vertex (see\nFig. 9). As a result, precision electroweak constraints are weakened. This is similar to the way in which R-parity is helpful for preventing excessive corrections\nto precision electroweak observables in supersymmetric theories.\nRef. [25] implemented-T parity in a variation of the Minimal Moose model.\nTo avoid SU (2)C -violation from higher-order terms in the non-linear sigma\nmodel kinetic term, the global symmetry is enlarged to contain products of\nSO(5) as in Ref. [21], rather than products of SU (3). If we further modify the\nMinimal Moose by gauging [SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]2 instead of SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1),\nand set the two SU (2) couplings and the two U (1) couplings equal, then the\ntheory possesses a Z2 symmetry that exchanges the gauge fields of the two\nSU (2) \u00d7 U (1) groups and sends \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3\u2020 , if we neglect the fermions for the time\nbeing. This is apparent from the reflection symmetry that exchanges the two\nsites in Fig. (8). Denoting one of the gauge fields of the first site by A1 and\nthe analogous gauge field from the second site by A2 , the linear combination\nA1 + A2 is even under this Z2 , and the orthogonal combination A1 \u2212 A2 is\nodd. But A1 \u2212 A2 is precisely the linear combination that becomes heavy when\nthe gauge symmetry is broken to the diagonal subgroup: as desired, the heavy\ngauge boson is odd under T-parity.\nFermions must be introduced into the picture in a way that preserves the Z2 ,\nand so identical copies are introduced on the two sites, i.e. one copy transforms\nunder one SU (2) \u00d7 U (1), and the other transforms under the second SU (2) \u00d7\nU (1). To make one linear combination of these fermions heavy, a third site is\n\n35\n\n\fintroduced, with mirror fermions that marry one linear combination. Once this\nis done, it is no longer true that all heavy gauge bosons are T-parity odd, but\ntaking the gauge couplings on the third site to be large makes these T-parityeven gauge bosons extra heavy and suppresses their couplings to Standard Model\nfermions, which still live on the other two sites.\nRefs. [28, 31] explore the potential role of T-parity in little Higgs models further, for instance by elucidating a systematic approach to incorporating\nfermions in models with T-parity, and by implementing T-parity in the Littlest\nHiggs model and in variants of the Littlest Higgs. It turns out that it is not\npossible to implement T-parity in models with a simple gauge group, such as\nthe SU (3) model.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nLITTLE HIGGS PHENOMENOLOGY\nPrecision Electroweak Constraints\n\nAs discussed in the introduction and alluded to in the previous section, indirect\nconstraints from precision electroweak measurements on new physics at the\nTeV scale are severe. The new physics predicted in little Higgs theories is no\nexception, and it is important to explore whether there are regions of parameter\nspace in which these models are consistent with precision electroweak data. Of\ncourse, agreement with data can always be achieved by increasing f , and thus\nthe masses of the new particles, but if f becomes too large, this comes at the\nprice of reintroducing fine tuning into the theory4 .\nThere are several sources of corrections to precision electroweak observables\nin little Higgs theories. The heavy gauge bosons couple to fermions and Higgs\ndoublets through the currents jF and jH . After integrating out these gauge\nbosons one obtains operators of the form jF jF , jF jH , and jH jH . The jF jF\nterms correspond to new four-fermion operators, which are most strongly constrained by limits from LEPII and from measurements of atomic parity violation,\nwhile the jF jH terms lead to modifications of the couplings of Standard Model\ngauge boson to fermions, and so are constrained by Z-pole data. The jH jH\nterms include the SU (2)C -violating operator (h\u2020 D\u03bc h)2 , which is generated by\nheavy U (1) gauge bosons, but not by heavy SU (2)-triplet gauge bosons.\nAnother potential source of SU (2)C -violation comes from expanding the\nkinetic term of the non-linear sigma model. This is not the case for the Littlest\nHiggs or the Simplest Little Higgs, but is true, for example, for the Minimal\nMoose. If the theory contains triplet scalars that acquire VEVs, as the Littlest\nHiggs does, these will also contribute to SU (2)C violation. All of the effects\ndiscussed so far are tree-level effects that can be analyzed using the type of\ngeneral effective field theory analysis given in Ref. [4]. Finally, there are also\nSU (2)C -violating loop contributions coming from the extended top sector, and\n4 Although constraints from precision electroweak data are often expressed as lower bounds\non f , one should keep in mind that the particle masses of the TeV-scale states are a better\nindicator of how finely tuned the theory is.\n\n36\n\n\fdepending on the model, from an extended Higgs sector.\nFor generic choices of parameters, these effects typically require little Higgs\nmodels to have fairly large values of f . For the Littlest Higgs, for instance, it\nwas found in Ref. [38] that constraints from precision electroweak data imply\nf > 4 TeV, which in turn puts a lower bound on the mass of the heavy quark\nequal to 5.7 TeV. An even slightly stronger bound was obtained in [39], by\ncombining indirect constraints with constraints from direct production of the\nheavy U (1) gauge boson at the Tevatron. Using the fact that the heavy quark\ncuts off the quadratic divergence in the top-loop contribution to the Higgs masssquared, the bound mU > 5.7 TeV was estimated to correspond to fine tuning\nat roughly the percent level.\nSimple modifications of the Littlest Higgs improve the situation without\nspoiling the stabilization of the electroweak scale. If we let the light fermions be\ncharged equally under both U (1)'s, rather than just under U (1)1 , then taking\ng1\u2032 = g2\u2032 decouples the heavy U (1) gauge boson from jF and jH simultaneously,\nand the precision electroweak problems associated with this particle go away.\nAlternatively, one can just gauge U (1)Y , rather than a product of U (1)'s, because the quadratically divergent contribution to the Higgs mass-squared due\nto hypercharge interactions is numerically small for \u039b \u223c 10 TeV. In Ref. [40] it\nwas shown that if only U (1)Y is gauged, there is allowed parameter space with\nf \u223c TeV, with the main constraint coming from the VEV of the triplet scalar.\nIn the model built on SU (6)/Sp(6), these regions expand due the absence of\nthe triplet [40, 41].\nPrecision electroweak constraints were also studied for the Minimal Moose\nmodel in Ref. [44], where it was found that by taking the gauge group to be\n[SU (2) \u00d7 U (1)]2 rather than SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) \u2013 again, this allows one\nto choose couplings that effectively decouple the heavy U (1) gauge boson from\nboth jF and jH \u2013 it is possible to find regions in parameter space that are consistent with precision electroweak constraints, without severe fine tuning. Finally,\nRef. [40] also analyzed contributions to precision electroweak observables in the\nSU (3) model, and found the constraint f > 4 TeV; however, in this case, the\nmass of the heavy fermion may be well below f , and so it is possible to have\nonly mild fine tuning even with large values of f .\nFor more on the indirect effects of new particles in little Higgs theories, we\nrefer the reader to the literature [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53].\nAlthough there is parameter space in which the simplest little Higgs theories\nare consistent with precision electroweak data, it is interesting to consider alternative models in which the most dangerous effects are automatically absent.\nThe T-parity conserving models discussed in the previous section are one example. Because tree-level effects associated with the T-odd particles are removed,\nbounds from precision electroweak data can be satisfied even with f below 1 TeV\n[21, 23]. The models incorporating SU (2)C , also already discussed, are another\nexample. These provide an alternative to gauging only U (1)Y by making the\nheavy U (1) gauge boson a member of an SU (2)C triplet.\n\n37\n\n\f5.2\n\nDirect Production of Little Higgs Partners\n\nThe spectrum of new particles varies somewhat from one little Higgs model\nto another, but all of them predict at least one vector-like quark at the TeV\nscale, along with extra gauge bosons and scalars. This is guaranteed given that\nthe little-Higgs mechanism arranges for quadratic divergences to cancel between\nstates of the same statistics. Here we summarize the prospects for these particles\nto be discovered at the LHC.\nLet us focus on theories with a product group structure. The collider phenomenology of a heavy U (1) gauge boson is certainly interesting, but since this\nparticle is associated with the most stringent precision electroweak constraints,\nand since it is not essential for stabilizing the weak scale, most phenomenological\nstudies have concentrated on the heavy SU (2) gauge bosons.\nAt the LHC, these gauge bosons would be produced in pp collisions predominantly through quark-antiquark annihilation. The production rate depends on\ncot \u03b8 = g1 /g2 , where g1 is the gauge coupling of the SU (2) under which the\nStandard Model fermion doublets transform, and g2 is the coupling of the other\nSU (2); the fermion couplings to the heavy gauge bosons are proportional to\ng cot \u03b8 . For cot \u03b8 = 1, the cross section for producing a 3 TeV neutral ZH at\nthe LHC is \u223c 100 fb [54, 55], corresponding to tens of thousands of events. A\nclean discovery channel would arise from the decay of ZH to pairs of highly\nenergetic leptons, and the discovery reach for cot \u03b8 = 1 is roughly 5 TeV. Preci< .2, but even for these values,\nsion electroweak data prefer smaller values, cot \u03b8 \u223c\nthe discovery reach is still well into the multi-TeV region. After ameliorating or\neliminating the precision electroweak constraints associated with a heavy U (1)\ngauge boson, the lower bound on the mass of the heavy SU (2) gauge bosons is\nroughly 2 TeV, leaving plenty of room for discovery.\nThe phenomenology of the heavy neutral gauge boson of the SU (3) model\n(Simplest Little Higgs) is similar to the phenomenology of the ZH in product\ngauge group models. On the other hand, the detection of the heavy SU (2)doublet gauge bosons of the SU (3) model is complicated by a v/f suppression\nof the coupling of these states to light quarks.\nEven if heavy gauge bosons are discovered, there is still the question of\nwhether they arise from a little Higgs model. Studying the Littlest Higgs, the\nauthors of Ref. [54] pointed out that the partial width of the ZH to fermions is\nproportional to cot2 \u03b8, while the partial width into boson pairs Zh and W + W \u2212\nis proportional to cot2 2\u03b8. This feature was proposed as an interesting test of the\nlittle Higgs structure, because in an alternative theory with the Higgs charged\nunder just one SU (2), the partial width into bosons is proportional to cot2 \u03b8\njust like for the fermions.\nThe production of the heavy quark (U, U c ) in the Littlest Higgs model was\nalso studied in Refs. [55, 56]. These can be pair-produced via their coupling\nto gluons, but due to the mixing in the top quark sector, they can also be\nproduced singly via W b fusion, W + b \u2192 U [55]. This mode, whose rate depends\non the ratio of the \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 couplings that appear in the top Yukawa sector of the\n> 1 TeV. The heavy\nmodel, tends to dominate for larger values of the mass, mU \u223c\n38\n\n\fquark branching fractions satisfy \u0393(U \u2192 th) \u2248 \u0393(U \u2192 tZ) \u2248 21 \u0393(U \u2192 bW + ),\nand all three decay modes lead to identifiable signatures. The discovery reach\ncan be estimated to be roughly 3 TeV.\nThe parameters \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 determine the top Yukawa coupling, and along with\nf , they also determine the mass of U and its coupling to light states. The decay\nconstant f can be determined by measurements of the properties of the heavy\ngauge bosons [54], and the known top Yukawa coupling gives one equation constraining \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 . By measuring mU one would obtain a second, independent\nequation. Ref. [56] considered whether it might be possible to test the structure\nof the Littlest Higgs top sector by combining the result of the measurement of\nmU with a measurement of the U production cross section, which depends on\n\u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 in yet another way. This would be another interesting experimental\nprobe of the little Higgs mechanism for canceling quadratic divergences, this\ntime in the top sector. The authors concluded that such a test might be feasible if the uncertainty in the bottom-quark parton distribution function were\nreduced.\nThe prospects for discovering extra scalar particles are quite model dependent. For the Littlest Higgs, Ref. [55] pointed out the possibility that the doubly\ncharged scalar belonging to the triplet \u03c6 would mediate a resonant contribution\nto longitudinal W W scattering, possibly giving a signal above background. In\nother little Higgs theories, for example SU (6)/Sp(6), the triplet is replaced\nby a neutral scalar, whose discovery prospects look grim (that model has two\nHiggs doublets, so the Higgs phenomenology would still be different than in the\nStandard Model).\nFinally, we should mention that the phenomenology of little Higgs theories\nis drastically altered if the theory conserves T-parity, in which case there are\nmissing-energy signals that are similar to those in supersymmetric theories with\nR-parity conservation [57] . Other work on little Higgs phenomenology appears\nin Refs. [58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68].\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nLittle Higgs theories are a compelling possibility for physics beyond the Standard\nModel. These theories feature weakly coupled new physics at the TeV scale,\nwhich stabilizes the Higgs potential even with a cut-off as large as \u223c 10 TeV.\nThe key ingredient is that the Higgs is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a\nspontaneously broken approximate global symmetry, with the explicit breaking\nof this symmetry collective in nature \u2013 that is, more than one coupling at a\ntime must be turned on for the symmetry to be broken. The collective breaking\nensures that no quadratically divergent contributions to the Higgs potential\narise at one loop. New TeV-scale particles cancel the quadratic divergences of\nStandard Model fields with the same statistics, and some of these new particles\nshould be revealed at the LHC if they play a role in stabilizing the weak scale.\nFor little Higgs theories with T-parity or any other unbroken discrete symmetry at the TeV scale, the lightest particle charged under the symmetry is stable,\n\n39\n\n\fand might play an important role in cosmology. If it is electrically neutral it\nmay well be a good cold dark matter candidate [69].\nLittle Higgs theories are effective field theories valid up to a cut-off \u039b \u223c 4\u03c0f .\nAn important question that this review has not addressed is what lies beyond\nthe cut-off \u039b. This question has not been explored extensively in the literature,\nbut we will conclude here by mentioning a few possibilities. One possibility\nis that that the global symmetry is broken by a weakly coupled scalar, and\nthis scalar's potential is protected by its own little Higgs mechanism \u2013 it is a\npseudo-NGB of a different symmetry. By building a structure with a single\niteration of this type one can raise the cut-off to \u039b \u223c 100 TeV [29], and more\nambitiously, one can attempt to construct a theory with many iterations, with\na much higher cut-off [33]. A different possibility is that the global symmetry\nis broken by strong dynamics that give rise to fermion condensation. In this\ncase the Higgs is a composite particle. An explicit little Higgs UV completion\nof this type was constructed in Ref. [26], which employs soft supersymmetry\nbreaking at \u223c 10 TeV to generate the four-fermion operators required to give\nmasses to the Standard Model fermions. Finally, theories have been constructed\nin five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space that can be interpreted as holographic\nduals of composite Higgs theories [24, 32, 34], and these theories can also be\nthought of as UV completions that involve strong dynamics at the scale \u039b.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
