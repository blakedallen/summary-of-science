The zero-lag synchronization thus obtained is robust over\na considerable parameter range. We substantiate our claims with experimental and numerical evidence of these synchronization solutions in a chain of three coupled semiconductor lasers with long\ninter-element coupling delays. The generality of the mechanism is validated in a neuronal model\nwith the same coupling architecture. Thus, our results show that synchronized dynamical states\ncan occur over long distances through relaying, without restriction by the amount of delay.\nPACS numbers: 42.65.Sf, 05.45.Xt, 42.55.Px\n\n1\n\n\fMutual coupling of oscillators often gives rise to collective dynamical behavior. Synchronization is a fascinating example of such emerging dynamics [1, 2] that plays important\nfunctional roles in complex systems. In the brain, for instance, synchronization of neural\nactivity has been shown to underlie cognitive acts [3]. Interestingly, isochronal synchronization (without lag) can occur in the brain between widely separated cortical regions [4, 5].\nNear-zero delay synchronization between pairwise recordings of neuronal signals has also\nbeen recently reported [6]. The mechanism of this phenomena has been subject of controversial debate, also in a more general context, for many years: how can two distant\ndynamical elements synchronize at zero lag even in the presence of non-negligible delays in\nthe transfer of information between them? In the neuronal case, complex mechanisms and\nneural architectures have been proposed to answer this question [7, 8, 9]. However, they\nexhibit limitations in the maximum synchronization range (see e.g. [8]), and rely on complex\nnetwork architectures [9].\nHere we present a configuration that can be regarded as a simple network module with\ndelayed interactions that exhibits zero-lag synchronization between two outer elements in a\nnatural way. The module consists of three similar dynamical elements coupled bidirectionally\nalong a line, in such a way that the central element acts as a relay of the dynamics between\nthe outer elements. This type of network module can be expected to exist, for instance,\nwithin the complex functional architecture of the brain [10].\nWe have chosen semiconductor lasers for our study, since they have proven to be excellent\nmodel systems to investigate the behavior of delay-coupled elements. An advantage of\nsemiconductor laser experiments is that these lasers can be well controlled, and that their\ndynamical behavior can be accurately described by established models. In addition, delays\nin the coupling occur generically, due to their fast dynamical timescales. The experimental\nsetup is depicted in Fig. 1. A central diode laser (LD2) is bidirectionally coupled to two\nouter lasers (LD1) and (LD3) by mutual injection. The central laser, which does not need\nto be carefully matched to the other two, mediates their dynamics. The lasers (Roithner\nRLT6505G) have a nominal wavelength of 655 nm, and have been coupled via their lasing\nTE-polarized fields. These off-the-shelf lasers exhibit typical parameter deviations of the\norder of a few percent, which highlights the robustness of the synchronization mechanism\nwhich we report in the following. In order to avoid influence from the non-lasing TM\nmodes, we have placed a polarizer (POL) before the input of laser 2.

A central laser (LD2) exchanges information between the other two\n(LD1 and LD3). The coupling times between the central and outer lasers are matched between\nboth branches.\n\ncollimates the output beam of each laser. 50% beamplitters (BS) allow to send fractions\nof the light to the other lasers and the rest to the corresponding photodetectors (PD). The\ncoupling strength, i.e. the amount of light interchanged by the lasers, has been controlled\nvia a neutral density filter (NDF). The lasers have been pumped slightly above their lasing\nthresholds (Idc \u223c 1.07Ith ) and the pump current and temperature have been controlled with\nhigh precision controllers (\u2206I < 0.01 mA and \u2206T < 0.01 K).\nA similar coupling configuration was proposed in Ref. [11], studying three laterally coupled lasers without delay. Experimental work in such a configuration [12] confirmed that\nidentical synchronization between the outer lasers, but not with the central one, is possible.\nIn our case, however, the lasers are physically separated, with the outer lasers placed at\nsimilar distances of \u223c 1.1 m from the central one. This results in equal coupling times\nof \u03c4c \u223c 3.65 ns, corresponding to the time the light takes to propagate from one laser to\nthe other. This time is longer than the characteristic relaxation oscillation period of the\ncarrier-photon system of each laser, which lies in the range of 1 ns or below. Due to this\ndelay the system becomes fundamentally different to those discussed in Refs. [11, 12]; delay\nrenders the system infinite dimensional, and determines the dynamical behavior, as well as\nthe synchronization properties and timings.\nWithout coupling, the three lasers emit constant power. Due to the mutual injection, the\nlasing threshold current of the lasers is reduced by 5 \u2212 10%. We note that small amounts\nof optical feedback due to reflections at the external facet of the respective opposite laser\n\n3\n\n\fcannot be avoided, nevertheless we have experimentally verified that they do not play an\nessential role. The laser outputs are sent to an optical spectrum analyzer with a resolution of\n0.05 nm, and detected by fast photodetectors (12 GHz bandwidth) whose signal is recorded\nand analyzed by a 4 GHz oscilloscope.\nIf we block the beam between the central laser and one of the outer lasers, the system\nreduces to the case of two mutually injected lasers. This situation has been extensively\nstudied: For short coupling delays the coupled system exhibits multistable locking for small\ndetuning and self-sustained oscillations for large detuning [13]. For long delays the stable\nlocking is lost, and coupling induces dynamical instabilities. The resulting dynamics can be\nsynchronized between the two lasers, although in a generalized way: the lasers show similar\nbut non-identical behavior. In particular, they are delayed with respect to each other by the\ncoupling time. Under detuned operation, the laser with higher optical frequency leads the\ndynamics, while for zero detuning the two lasers spontaneously switch leader and laggard\nroles [14]. The isochronous and identical synchronized solution exists mathematically, but\nhas been found to be unstable [15].\nWhen the blocking of the isolated laser is removed, all three mutually coupled lasers\nexhibit chaotic outputs. Remarkably, now both outer lasers synchronize with zero lag, while\nthe central laser either leads or lags the outer lasers. Figure 2 shows the time series of the\noutput intensities (left column), in pairs, and the corresponding cross-correlation functions\nCij (\u2206t), defined as in [15], in such a way that a maximal cross-correlation at a positive time\ndifference \u2206tmax indicates that element j is leading element i by the time \u2206tmax , and vice\nversa. For optimal synchronization quality, the optical frequency of the central laser has\nbeen slightly decreased with respect to the outer lasers (negatively detuned) by adjusting\nits temperature. Zero-lag synchronization between the intensities of the outer lasers can be\nclearly seen in Fig. 2(A), and also manifests itself in the cross-correlation function shown in\nFig. 2(D), which presents an absolute maximum of 0.86 at \u2206tmax = 0 (i.e. at zero delay).\nThe correlation between the central laser and the outer ones [Fig. 2(B,C)] is not as high, and\nexhibits a non-zero time lag, as can be seen from the cross-correlation functions shown in\nFig. 2(E)-(F), which yield maxima of 0.56 and 0.59, respectively, placed at \u2206tmax = \u22123.65 ns.\nThis lag coincides with the coupling time \u03c4c between the lasers. The fact that \u2206tmax is\nnegative means that the central laser dynamically lags the two outer lasers. Therefore, it\ncan be excluded that the outer lasers are simply driven by the central one.

We note that the synchronization also remains robust for positive detuning.\nHowever, then the central laser leads the dynamics.\nIn order to gain further insight into the zero-lag synchronization phenomenon and its\nstability, we have mathematically modeled the laser system via a rate equation model that\ndescribes the complex amplitudes of the optical fields and the corresponding carrier numbers\nof the three lasers:\n\u0116m (t) =\n+\n\n1\n(1 + i\u03b1) [Gm \u2212 \u03b3] Em (t)\n2\n3\nX\n\n\u03bal,m e\u2212i\u03c90 \u03c4 El (t \u2212 \u03c4 )\n\n(1)\n\nl=1\n\n\u1e44m (t) =\n\nIm\n\u2212 \u03b3e Nm \u2212 Gm |Em |2\ne\n\n(2)\n\nwith Gm = g * (Nm \u2212 N0 )/(1 + \u01eb|Em |2 ).

Here, we first discuss the perfectly symmetric situation where the lasers are identical\nwith respect to internal parameters and operating conditions. This allows to verify whether\nthe role of the central laser depends on asymmetries in the system. Additionally, we consider\nhigh pump currents for the lasers, a dynamical situation difficult to analyze experimentally\ndue to the broad bandwidth of the dynamics. Figure 3(A-C) shows time series of the two\nouter lasers (LD1 and LD3) and the relay laser (LD2) in pairs. One can easily notice that the\ndynamics of the outer lasers are more similar to each other than to that of the central one.\nTo better analyze the dynamics we compute the cross-correlation functions between laser\npairs.

The time series of the central laser have been shifted \u03c4c to allow an easier comparison.\n\nlaser clearly lags the dynamics with respect to the outer lasers, that are almost perfectly\nsynchronized at zero lag. As in the experiments, and even more emphasized in this case\nof higher injection current, the correlation is practically 1 between the outer lasers and\n6\n\n\flower between each outer laser and the central one. We note that numerical results for\nlower injection currents, matching the experimental results shown above, exhibit similar\nzero-lag synchronization properties. In addition we have systematically studied, by means\nof numerical simulations, the influence of parameter mismatch of the lasers, mismatch of the\ndelay times, and influence of external perturbations. We find that the central laser can have\nlarge parameter mismatch without preventing the occurrence of zero-lag synchronization.\nFor relative mismatch between the outer lasers synchronization is also robust, although\nthe acceptable tolerances are smaller in this case. Applying external perturbations via the\npump current did not destroy the synchronization. Even more, we have verified that zerolag synchronization also maintains for pump current modulation of the lasers and, which\nis relevant for real networks, synchronization with almost zero lag persists even for small\nmismatch of the coupling delay times between the lasers.\nIn order to prove whether the behavior is indeed generic, we have performed simulations of\nthree Hodgkin-Huxley-type neurons connected according to the same network architecture.\nWe have chosen a model of a thermoreceptor neuron [17] that exhibits a variety of dynamical\nbehavior ranging from regular spiking to bursting and self-sustained chaotic pulsations,\ndepending on the temperature. The neurons are mutually coupled in pairs via synaptic\nconnections. The delay in the information transmission between the neurons is taken to be\nmuch longer than the internal time scale of the spiking process.\nIn the following, we have considered a regime in which isolated neurons exhibit irregular\nspikes grouped in regular bursts. For a network of two delay-coupled neurons, small correlations between spikes are observed at time differences corresponding to the connection time.\nWhen a mediating neuron is added, identical synchronization at zero-lag appears between\nthe outer neurons, as shown in Fig. 4. Moreover, the correlation between the mediating neuron and the outer ones is significantly smaller, with the central neuron lagging the dynamics\nat a time that amounts to the connection delay. Therefore, the central results obtained for\ncoupled lasers also stand for the neuron model: for two elements leader-laggard dynamics is\nobserved, while for three elements zero-lag synchronization of the outer elements and lagging\nof the central element occur.\nWe note, that we have been able to find the presented zero-lag synchronization mechanism additionally in model calculations for a large variety of dynamical systems including\nexcitable systems, oscillators and maps for periodic or even chaotic dynamics, proving its\n7\n\n\f20\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n-80\n\n1\nC13(\u2206t)\n\nN1,N3\n\n0\n\n0.4\n(B)\n\n0.8\nN1,N2\n\n0\n\n0.4\n(C)\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0\n\nN3,N2\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n(E)\n\n0.5\n0\n\n-0.5\n-40\n1\n\n1.2\n\n(D)\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n-40\n1\n\n1.2\n\nC12(\u2206t)\n\n20\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n-80\n\n(A)\n\nC32(\u2206t)\n\nPotential (mV)\nPotential (mV)\nPotential (mV)\n\n20\n0\n-20\n-40\n-60\n-80\n\n-20\n(F)\n\n0.5\n0\n\n-0.5\n0\n20\n-40 -20\n40\n\u2206t (units of \u03c4c = 15 ms)\n\n0.8\n0.4\n1.2\nTime (s)\n\nFIG. 4: Synchronization of three bidirectionally coupled thermoreceptor neurons.

In addition, it proves that the topology governs the described synchronization properties. Certain commonly occurring network modules, called motifs, have been\nproposed as basic building blocks of complex networks [18]. Those studies considered instantaneous coupling, but the fact that interactions propagate at finite speed can not always\nbe neglected, resulting in modified motifs. We have studied the behavior of a three-element\nnetwork module, showing that dynamical relaying leads to zero-lag synchronization even in\nthe presence of coupling delays. This behavior corresponds to a stable isochronous synchronization solution of the dynamics, and is possible irrespective of the distance between the\ntwo outer elements, provided the two branches have similar lengths. Our results show that\ngeneric dynamical networks can profit from collective synchronization phenomena which can\neven overcome the limitation of inter-element propagation delays.\nResearch supported by the Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Ciencia (Spain) and FEDER\n8\n\n\f(projects CONOCE2, AUCOFLUC and LASEA) and by the Generalitat de Catalunya.\nIn addition, I.F. acknowledges funding from the FWO under contract number GP06704FWOSL21.
