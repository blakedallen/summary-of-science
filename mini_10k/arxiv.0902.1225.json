In all these contexts, the symmetry of the order parameter is of profound importance. Over the last decades, the possibility of superconducting order parameters that change sign\nunder a time-coordinate exchange of the two fermions comprising the Cooper-pair, has emerged in addition to the by now\nwell studied varieties of orbital symmetries [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This\nso-called odd-frequency superconductivity [6] is distinct from\nthe traditional even-frequency pairing in the Bardeen-CooperSchrieffer paradigm, and may be induced by proximity effects\nin hybrid structures of superconductors and magnets [1].\nIn a broader context, proximity systems offer the possibility\nof controlling the physics of competing broken symmetries.\nThe fundamental heterostructure for studying proximity induced superconductivity is the superconductor/normal metal\n(S|N) bilayer, where the normal metal or the interface may\nhave magnetic properties. Among possible triplet pair correlations, in the diffusive limit odd-frequency pairs are favored\n[7], whereas in ballistic hybrid systems both odd- and evenfrequency amplitudes compete [3, 4]. As all known superconductors to date exhibit an even-frequency order parameter, the\nobservation of proximity induced effects that are particular to\nodd-frequency pairing would be of utmost interest.\nThere are two major difficulties associated with the detection of the odd-frequency state in superconductor/ferromagnet\n(S|F) bilayers. One is the usually short penetration depth\ninto the ferromagnetic region, limited by the magnetic coherence length \u03beF , much less than the superconducting coherence\nlength \u03beS [1]. Another problem is that odd-frequency pairs are\nonly well defined when even-frequency correlations vanish in\nthe ferromagnet. Clear-cut signatures of the former are therefore only accessible in a limited parameter regime [8].\nThe majority of work on superconducting proximitystructures so far has been restricted to the diffusive limit and\nspin-inactive interfaces [9]. For a non-magnetic bilayer, a\nminigap appears in the density of states of the normal metal.\nIt scales with the Thouless energy of the normal layer and\n\nwith the transmission probability of the interface. Such minigap structures are readily accessible experimentally [10]. For\na spin-active interface, the transmission properties of spin-\u2191\nand spin-\u2193 electrons into a metal are different, and this gives\nrise to both spin-dependent conductivities and spin-dependent\nphase shifts at the interface [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In this Letter\nwe show that a spin-active interface in a S|N bilayer produces\nclear signatures of purely odd-frequency triplet pairing amplitudes that can be tested experimentally.\nWe consider the system shown in Fig. 1. The superconductor is conventional (even-frequency s-wave) while the interface is magnetic. We find that there is a dramatic change in\nthe nature of proximity correlations when the spin-dependent\nphase shifts exceed the tunneling probability of the interface.\nThe spin-active interface in an S|N bilayer causes the evenfrequency correlations to vanish at zero excitation energy,\nwhile odd-frequency correlations appear. At the same time,\nthe minigap, one of the hallmarks of the conventional proximity effect, is replaced by a low-energy band with enhanced\ndensity of states. We focus on the density of states (DOS)\nin the normal region, which can be probed by tunneling experiments. Our findings suggest that it should be possible to\ndetect the odd-frequency amplitude without any interfering effects of even-frequency correlations. Since the exchange field\nis absent in the normal metal, this resolves the two main difficulties associated with the experimental detection of oddfrequency correlations mentioned above.\nWe adopt the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity\n[18], where information about the physical properties of the\nsystem is embedded in the Green's function.

The remarkable aspect of Eqs. (1)\nand (2) is that they are valid for any value of the width d below the inelastic scattering length, and for any interface parameter \u03b3. Thus, the vanishing of the singlet component is\na robust feature in S|N structures with spin-active interfaces,\nas long as |G\u03c6 |/GT > 1. Without loss of generality, we\nfocus on positive values\nPof G\u03c6 from now on.

At zero-energy, the DOS thus van-\n\nishes as long as G\u03c6 /GT < 1, which means that the usual\nminigap in S|N structures survives in this regime. However,\nthe zero-energy DOS is enhanced for G\u03c6 /GT > 1 since the\nsinglet component vanishes there.\n\nGT > G\u03c6\nImfs\n\n2\n0\n4\n\nGT < G\u03c6\na\n\nRefs\n\ntriplet\n\nc\n0\n\u03b5/\u03b50\n\n1 \u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\u03b5/\u03b50\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\nReft\n\nImfs\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n6\n\nf\n4\n\nd\n0\n\u03b5/\u03b50\n\n0.0\n0.5\n1.5\n\nG\u03c6 /GT\n\n2\n\n0\n\u22122\n\nImft\n\nImft\n\u22124\n\u22121\n\ne\n\nReft\n\n0\n\u22122\n\n4\nb\n\nRefs\nReft\n\n2\n\nImfs\n\nN (\u03b5)/N0\n\nsinglet\n\nN (0)/N0\n\nf (\u03b5)\n\n4\n\nf (\u03b5)\n\ntion, \u011d, that is parameterized conveniently in the normal (N)\nregion by a parameter \u03b8\u03c3 , allowing for both singlet and triplet\ncorrelations [8]. In the superconducting (S) region, we employ the bulk solution \u011dS = c * \u03c43 \u2297 \u03c30 + s * \u03c41 \u2297 (\u0131\u03c32 ), with\nc = cosh(\u03b8), s = sinh(\u03b8), \u03b8 = atanh(\u2206/\u03b5), \u03c4i and \u03c3i being\nPauli matrices in particle-hole and spin space, respectively.\nWe use the formalism described in Ref. [8], and consider first the diffusive limit. Then, the orbital symmetry for all proximity amplitudes is reduced to s-wave and\nhence the singlet component always has an even-frequency\nsymmetry while the triplet component has an odd-frequency\nsymmetry. The Green's functions are subject to boundary\nconditions, which in the tunneling limit assume the following form at the S|N interface [13, 15]: 2\u03b3d\u011dN \u2202x \u011dN =\n[\u011dS , \u011dN ] + \u0131(G\u03c6 /GT )[\u03c40 \u2297 \u03c33 , \u011dN ], and at the outer interface\nread \u2202x \u011dN = 0\u0302. Here, \u03b3 = RB /RN where RB (RN ) is the\nresistance of the barrier (normal region), and d is the width of\nthe normal region, while GT is the junction conductance in the\nnormal-state. The boundary condition above contains an additional term G\u03c6 compared to the usual non-magnetic boundary\nconditions in Ref. [9]. This term is due to spin-dependent\nphase shifts of quasiparticles being reflected at the interface.\nG\u03c6 may be non-zero even if the transmission GT \u2192 0, corresponding to a ferromagnetic insulator [13].\np We define the superconducting coherence length \u03beS = D/\u2206 and Thouless\nenergy \u03b5Th = D/d2 , where D is the diffusion constant, and\nassume that the inelastic scattering length, lin , is sufficiently\nlarge, such that d \u226a lin .\nThe Usadel equation [19] reads D\u2202x2 \u03b8\u03c3 + 2\u0131\u03b5 sinh \u03b8\u03c3 = 0,\nG\nwith boundary condition \u03b3d\u2202x \u03b8\u03c3 = (cs\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3sc\u03c3 ) + \u0131\u03c3s\u03c3 GT\u03c6\nat x = 0 and \u2202x \u03b8\u03c3 = 0 at x = d. Here, c\u03c3 = cosh(\u03b8\u03c3 )\nand s\u03c3 = sinh(\u03b8\u03c3 ).

In e), we plot the energy-resolved\nDOS for several values of G\u03c6 /GT . Finally, f) shows the zero-energy\nDOS as a function of GT /G\u03c6 , with the proximity amplitudes shown\nin the inset.\n\nThe full energy-dependence of the DOS may only be obtained numerically. To model a realistic experimental setup,\nwe fix \u03b3 = 10 and d/\u03beS = 1.0, although our qualitative results are independent of these particular choices. As a measure of the relevant energy scale, we define \u03b50 = \u03b5Th /(2\u03b3).\nThe results are shown in Fig. 2 to investigate the effect\nof the spin-dependent phase shifts. The low-energy DOS is\nstrongly enhanced due to the odd-frequency amplitude when\nG\u03c6 /GT > 1 (G\u03c6 /GT = 1.5 in the figure). Conversely, the\nDOS develops a minigap around \u03b5 = 0 when G\u03c6 /GT < 1\n(G\u03c6 /GT = 0.5 in the figure). The ratio G\u03c6 /GT depends on\nthe microscopic barrier properties [15]. In the tunneling limit,\none finds that G\u03c6 can be considerably larger than GT .\nWe suggest the following qualitative explanation for the\nmechanism behind the separation between even- and oddfrequency correlations. The superconductor induces a minigap \u221d GT in the normal metal, while the spin-active barrier\ninduces an effective exchange field \u221d G\u03c6 . The situation in the\nnormal metal then resembles that of a thin-film conventional\nsuperconductor in the presence of an in-plane external magnetic field [22], with the role of the gap and field played by\nGT and G\u03c6 , respectively. In that case, it is known that superconductivity is destroyed above the Clogston-Chandrasekhar\nlimit [23], as the spin-singlet Cooper-pairs break up. In the\npresent case, we observe coexistence of the exchange field\nand spin-singlet even-frequency superconductivity as long as\nG\u03c6 is below the critical value of G\u03c6 = GT . However, for\nG\u03c6 > GT spin-singlet pairing is no longer possible at the\nchemical potential. It is then replaced by spin-triplet pairing,\nwhich must be odd in frequency due to the isotropization of\nthe gap in the diffusive limit. Thus, there is a natural separation between even-frequency and odd-frequency pairing in\nthe normal metal at a critical value of the effective exchange\nfield G\u03c6 .\nThe same effect occurs in the ballistic limit, as we now\nshow. In this case, we can obtain the retarded Green's function using the formalism described in Refs. [14, 16].

The spin mixing angles \u03b8S , \u03b8N , \u03b8SN , and\n\u03b8N S describe spin dependent scattering phases [11]. Neglecting spin flip scattering, the transmission and reflection amplitudes are diagonal in spin space, and the relations r S = r N \u2261\ndiag [r\u2191 , r\u2193 ], tN S = tSN \u2261 diag [t\u2191 , t\u2193 ], r\u21912 +t2\u2191 = r\u21932 +t2\u2193 = 1,\n\u03b8N S + \u03b8SN = \u03b8S + \u03b8N follow from the unitarity of \u015c. Possible scalar phases are omitted in Eq. (3), as they play no role\nin the final results.\nWe next concentrate on subgap energies. The anomalous amplitudes can be decomposed into singlet and triplet\ncomponents, f = (fs + ft \u03c33 )(i\u03c32 ). Defining f\u03c3 =\n(fs + \u03c3ft )/2, we obtain on the top of\np the normal overlayer (x = d) f\u03c3 (\u03b5) = \u2212sgn(\u03b1\u03c3 )t\u2191 t\u2193 / \u03b12\u03c3 \u2212 (t\u2191 t\u2193 )2 with\n\u03b1\u03c3 = sin (2\u03b5d/vF x + \u03c3\u03b8+ ) + r\u2191 r\u2193 sin (2\u03b5d/vF x + \u03c3\u03b8\u2212 ).\nHere, \u03b8\u00b1 = 21 (\u03b8N \u00b1 \u03b8S ) \u00b1 arcsin(\u03b5/\u2206), and \u03b5 has to be\nsupplemented by an infinitesimally small positive imaginary\npart. The interface parameters and the Fermi velocity component in x-direction, vF x = vF cos \u03c8, depend on the impact\nangle \u03c8. The relevant energy scale in the problem is the ballistic Thouless energy, \u03b5T h = vF /2d. For zero spin mixing\nangles we recover the known DOS for a normal state overlayer on a singlet superconductor. The DOS is non-zero only\nfor |\u03b1| > t\u2191 t\u2193 , which for sufficiently large impact angle always is fulfilled. Clearly, the most interesting regime concerns\n\u03b5/\u03b5T h \u223c |\u03b8\u00b1 | \u223c t\u2191 t\u2193 .\nIn the tunneling limit, for small excitation energies\n\u03b5/\u03b5T h \u226a 1 and small spin mixing angles \u03b8\u00b1 we obtain\n\u03b1\u03c3 = (4\u03b5d/vF x + \u03c3\u03b8N ). In this case, due to \u03b8+ + \u03b8\u2212 = \u03b8N ,\nonly the spin mixing angle for reflection at the normal side\nof the interface enters, and acts as an effective exchange field\nb = \u03b8N vF x /4d on the quasiparticles. Especially interesting is\nthe case \u03b5 = 0, for which all proximity amplitudes are even in\nmomentum. For \u03b5 = 0 we obtain \u03b1\u03c3 = \u03c3\u03b8N , and the pairing\namplitudes are either purely (odd-frequency) triplet,\n\nT0<\u03b8N\n\nT0>\u03b8N\n\n0.6 singlet\n\nN(\u03b5)/N0\n\nEilenberger equation in the normal region reads ivF x \u2202x \u011d +\n[\u03b5\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c30 , \u011d] = 0\u0302.

A systematic expansion of all terms in the\n\ntunneling probability shows that in the tunneling limit the spin\ndependence of the transmission probabilities can be neglected,\nand only that of the phase shifts needs to be kept. Thus, we\nassume t\u2191 = t\u2193 = t. We model the dependence on the impact\n1\nangle \u03c8 as t(\u03bc) = (t0 ) \u03bc , \u03bc = cos \u03c8, and assume for simplicity spin mixing angles independent of \u03bc. The tunneling probability for normal impact is T0 = t20 . In the case T0 < \u03b8N at\nsmall energies the odd frequency triplet amplitude dominates,\nand it is the only non-zero amplitude at \u03b5 = 0. On the other\nhand, for T0 > \u03b8N both singlet and triplet amplitudes contribute. This is due to the fact that for large impact angles the\n\n\f4\ntransmission probability t(\u03bc)2 drops below the value for the\nspin mixing angle \u03b8N .\nWe turn now to the DOS. The general expression, assuming the bulk solution in the superconductor, is N (\u03b5)/N0 =\np\nR1\nP\nRe \u03c3=\u00b11 0 |\u03b1\u03c3 |/ \u03b12\u03c3 \u2212 (t\u2191 t\u2193 )2 d\u03bc. In the tunneling\nlimit, this simplifies again, and provided that |\u03b8N | >\nt\u2191 t\u2193 for all impact angles, the DOS at the Fermi level\nis\nits normal state value, N (0)/N0 =\nR enhancedpabove\nd\u03bc |\u03b8N |/ \u03b82N \u2212 (t\u2191 t\u2193 )2 . In Fig. 4, we show results for\nthe DOS. In (a-b) we assume the dependence on the impact\nangle as above, whereas in (c-d) we allow tunnelling only in a\nnarrow tunneling cone of 10 degrees. The DOS for the cases\nof dominating triplet amplitudes and dominating singlet amplitudes differ qualitatively. In the case of a tunneling cone\nthis difference is most drastic, and a comparison with the results above shows that it is very similar to the diffusive case.\nIn the right panels, where \u03b8N = \u03b8S = 0.2, we demonstrate\nthat for T0 < 0.2 only the odd frequency triplet amplitude\nis present at the chemical potential, while the singlet amplitude is zero. The corresponding zero-bias DOS is enhanced\nin this region, whereas it is reduced in the region when singlet\ncorrelations are present at \u03b5 = 0.\nThe simplest experimental manifestation of the oddfrequency component is a zero-energy peak in the DOS\n[17, 20, 21]. In S|F layers, where this phenomenon has\nbeen discussed previously, a clear zero-energy peak is unfortunately often masked by the simultaneous presence of singlet\ncorrelations fs , which tend to suppress the DOS at low energies. This is not so in the system we consider, provided only\nT0 < |\u03b8N | in the ballistic limit, or equivalently, GT < |G\u03c6 | in\nthe diffusive limit. This is ideal for a direct observation of the\nodd-frequency component, manifested as a zero-energy peak\nin the DOS.\nThe important factor, with regard to isolation of the oddfrequency correlations at zero energy is the interface. The\neven-frequency correlations vanish completely when the interface transmission is sufficiently low. The parameters \u03b8N ,\nor equivalently, G\u03c6 can be increased by increasing the magnetic polarization of the barrier separating the superconducting and normal layers. By fabricating several samples with\nprogressively increasing strength of magnetic moment of the\nbarrier, one should be able to observe an abrupt crossover at\nthe zero-energy DOS above a certain strength of the magnetic\nmoment. Alternatively, one could alter the interface transmission by varying the thickness of the insulating region.\nIn summary, we have investigated the proximity-effect in\n\na superconductor/normal metal bilayer with spin-active interface. We find that both in the ballistic and diffusive limits,\nthe usual even-frequency correlations may vanish completely\nat zero energy, while odd-frequency correlations persist. This\nresult is completely independent of the specific values for the\nlayer thicknesses and barrier resistances, indicating that it is a\nrobust and general feature of spin-active interfaces. Our findings suggest a way of obtaining unambiguous experimental\nidentification of superconducting odd-frequency correlations.\nAcknowledgments. A. Cottet and D.
