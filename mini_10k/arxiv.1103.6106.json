In the recent\nyears, ternary lipid systems comprising phospholipids\nand cholesterol were established as important model systems in relation with lateral lipid segregation phenomena\nin membranes. At the root of this rich phenomenology\nlies a complex phase behavior of certain lipid mixtures, in\nwhich cholesterol molecules play a unique role. Ternary\nsystems comprising a phospholipid in the liquid state, a\nsecond phospholipid in the gel state and cholesterol display several unique characteristics, the two most important of them being arguably a wide binary coexistence\ngap between the so-called liquid disordered (Ld ) and liquid ordered (Lo ) phases, and a region of triple coexistence [3\u20135].\nA prominent feature of phospholipid membranes is\ntheir main thermodynamic transition, from a low temperature gel or rippled gel phase (usually termed L\u03b2 ,P\u03b2 ), to\na high temperature liquid phase (L\u03b1 ) [2]. A sharp change\nin the statistical conformations of the hydrophobic chains\noccurs at the transition, associated with membrane thinning and an increase of the area per phospholipid. The\ntransition takes place at a melting temperature Tm whose\nprecise value depends on the chemical structure of the\nchains. It is a weakly first order transition for membrane of pure composition. The thermotropic behavior\nof phospholipid binary mixtures have been studied since\nthe seminal work of Mabrey and Sturtevant [6] and supports the view that liquid-prone and gel-prone lipids tend\nto phase separate. This suggests that mixtures composed\nof phospholipids with same head group have their miscibility behavior governed by the competition between\ntheir liquid and gel conformations. Hence, a description\nof ternary lipid systems must necessarily, and to some extent, account for the internal state of the phospholipids.\nWe introduce in this Letter a simple, robust and pre-\n\ndictive model of phospholipid-cholesterol mixtures phase\ncoexistence. Our model aims at predicting the miscibility behavior of phospholipids, based upon the thermodynamic properties of their main transition [7\u201310].\nThe thermotropic behavior of the phospholipid tails is\nmodeled with an internal order parameter, in a way\nthat schematically reproduces the thermodynamic features of the liquid-gel transition. The peculiar features\nof cholesterol-phospholipid interactions [11, 12] are accounted for by means of a non-ideal mixing entropy generalizing the one proposed by Komura et al. [13]. In\naddition, we outline an original numerical procedure for\nthe derivation of ternary phase diagrams.\nThe stability of a mixture is governed by its Gibbs freeenergy of mixing Gmix . This thermodynamic function\nexpresses the free-energy difference between the homogeneous mixed state and the system comprising the separated pure components with same global composition.\nTernary mixtures in membranes are therefore described\nby Gmix (T, n1 , n2 , n3 ), where the ni are the molar content\nof each lipid, and T the temperature. We assume that the\nhydrostatic pressure remains constant, close to the standard value, and that lipid membranes have no tension,\nso that these two intensive parameters are absent from\nGmix . Membranes are assumed to be well hydrated with\na large excess of water, and free from any other external\nfields [14].\nThe simplest realization of our model, described in this\nLetter, assumes that the areas per lipid ai do not change\nwith temperature. This allows us to express Gmix in\nterms of the surface fractions \u03c61 , \u03c62 and \u03c6C of each lipid\ncomponent, \u03c6C standing for the cholesterol. We claim\nthat it is acceptable to neglect all changes in the area\nper lipid at T = Tm , in a first approximation to the\ndescription of the mixture phase coexistence, especially\nin the absence of membrane tension. This restriction is\nnot a fundamental one, and versions of our model accounting for membrane expansion at the transition will\nbe presented elsewhere [15].\n\n\f2\nA frequent approximation to non-ideal solutions is obtained by combining an ideal mixing entropy with a\nquadratic enthalpic term. For a membrane of area A, the\nfree-energy of mixing per unit of area, gmix = \u03b2Gmix /A,\nreads:\ngmix\n\n\u03c62\n\u03c6C\n\u03c61\nln(\u03c61 ) +\nln(\u03c62 ) +\nln(\u03c6C )\n=\na1\na2\naC\n+\u03c712 \u03c61 \u03c62 + \u03c71C \u03c61 \u03c6C + \u03c72C \u03c62 \u03c6C ,\n\na)\n\nChol.\n\nChol.\n\nLo\n\nLd\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03c61 +\u03c62 +\u03c6C = 1 and \u03b2 the Boltzmann factor 1/kB T ,\nand a1 , a2 and aC are the areas of the three different lipid\nspecies. One observes that expression (1) alone does not\naccount for the main transition, and that the effective\ninteraction parameters \u03c7ij are expected to display a non\ntrivial and unknown temperature dependence. We could\nnot obtain, based on (1), any diagram comparable with\nthe experimental ones. Moreover, our attempts to do\nso lead to unexpectedly large values of aC , conflicting\nwith the view that cholesterol molecules are smaller than\nphospholipids.\nExperiments and simulations either suggest that\ncholesterol may form transient bound complexes with\nphospholipid moieties surrounding them [11, 12]. The\npresence of such complexes prevents cholesterol molecules\nfrom occupying too many neighboring positions, thus giving the semblance of a large excluded volume. To account for the statistical behavior of cholesterol molecules,\nwe derived the following entropic contribution, where all\nlipid areas have been set to unit:\nG (E) (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) = \u03c61 ln(\u03c61 ) + \u03c62 ln(\u03c62 ) + \u03c6C ln(\u03c6C )\n\u2212 (\u03c61 + \u03c62 ) log(\u03c61 + \u03c62 ) + (\u03b4 \u22121 \u2212 \u03c6C ) log(1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6C ).\n(2)\nThis expression originates from a lattice enumeration of\nconfigurations, following Flory, where each cholesterol\nmolecule deprives an average number \u03b4 of neighboring\nsites from the possibility of being occupied by another\ncholesterol molecule. Expression (2) reduces to ideal mixing when \u03b4 \u2192 1, and is similar to the entropy of Komura\net al. for binary systems and \u03b4 = 2 [13]. It accounts\nfor both the mixing term and the excluded volume between cholesterol molecules, consistent with the presence\nof cholesterol complexes. It finally sets a maximal value\n\u03c6C \u2264 1/\u03b4 to the mixture content in cholesterol.\nSeveral Landau order parameters have been proposed\nfor describing the liquid-gel chain melting [7, 8, 10, 13,\n16]. Theories based on a single scalar order parameter\ncan pretend to capture only rough features of the main\ntransition. This is why, for simplicity and generality, we\nrestrict ourselves to a schematic approach, a two-state\nmodel based on a scalar order parameter m restricted to\nthe interval [\u22121, 1].

Eq. (3) represents a meanfield Ising model in the presence of an effective external\nfield heff = h1 \u03c61 + h2 \u03c62 . For J \u0303 \u2265 J \u0303c = 1/4, the m\ndependence of G (I) is shaped as a double well potential,\nwith a linear bias induced by heff . The order parameter\nm fluctuates freely around an optimal value m\u22c6 located\nat the global minimum of G (I) , with (T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 ) constant.\nIn practice, as soon as J \u0303 is larger than 0.3, the two local minima are close to \u00b11. We conventionally ascribe\nmg \u2243 \u22121 to represent the L\u03b2 gel phase, while ml \u2243 1 is\nset to represent the L\u03b1 liquid phase. The coupling J \u0303 expresses that neighboring lipid tails tend to be in the same\nstate, irrespective of the chemical species to which they\nbelong. This is the main cooperative effect that induces\nthe liquid-gel separation.\nThe term heff acts as a switch that drives the order parameter from its m\u22c6 = mg gel state to its m\u22c6 = ml liquid\nstate, upon changing its sign from negative to positive.\nOne sees from (4) that if lipid 1 is pure, h1 (T ) changes its\nsign at T = T1 while m\u22c6 (T ) suddenly jumps from mg to\nml , with an amplitude \u2206m\u22c6 \u2243 2. The enthalpic change\nis close to \u2206H1 , so that \u2206H1 can be identified with the\nmolar latent heat at the main transition. The difference\nin Gibbs free-energy between the liquid and gel phases\nat T 6= T1 is then extrapolated linearly with T at the\nvicinity of the transition. The contribution G (I) is thus\nentirely specified by the temperature and the enthalpy\ndifference at the transition of the lipid species composing\nthe mixture. This term induces a liquid-gel separation in\nthe whole temperature range [T1 , T2 ].\n\n\f3\nCholesterol-phospholipid interactions are further accounted for with a specific interaction term\nG (C) (\u03c61 , \u03c62 , m) = \u03c7\u03c61 \u03c6C \u2212 \u03bem(\u03c61 + \u03c62 )\u03c6C\n\n30 \u00b0c\n\n(5)\n\nEq. (5) comprises a m-dependent contribution, proportional to \u03be, which marks the preference of cholesterol\nfor either the m = 1 liquid order, or the m = \u22121\ngel order, according to the sign of \u03be. This interaction\ndoes not discriminate between saturated and unsaturated lipids, since it describes a coupling to the chain\norder. Other cholesterol-phospholipid interactions are\naccounted for by a m-independent contribution in \u03c7.\nThis order-insensitive interaction introduces a coupling\nbetween cholesterol and the unsaturated component. We\nfound that interactions between cholesterol and the saturated component are not required to describe the experimental phase diagrams.\nThe sum G(T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 , m) = G (E) + G (I) + G (C) is our\nmain thermodynamic potential. In the absence of surface tension, and assuming that changes in internal state\noccur at constant volume, m fluctuates around its optimal value m\u22c6 , with m = m\u22c6 in the thermodynamic limit.\nTherefore, the free-energy of mixing gmix (T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 ) is obtained by minimizing G(T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 , m) with respect to m\nat fixed temperature and surface fractions [10].\ngmix (T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 ) = min [G(T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 , m)]|T,\u03c61 ,\u03c62\nm\n\n= G(T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 , m\u22c6 (T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 )).\n\nCritical points\n\n(6)\n\nThe Gibbs free-energy surface gmix arises from projecting out m from the four-dimensional potential G. Equivalently, gmix can be viewed as the restriction of G to\nthe submanifold \u2202m G = 0. For J \u0303 > J \u0303c , the constraint\n\u2202m G = 0 defines two stable submanifolds, a negative\nmg (T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 ) and a positive ml (T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 ) branch, linked\nrespectively with the gel and liquid phases. At fixed\n(T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 ), only one of the two branches is the stable\none, while the other branch remains metastable.\nIn ternary mixtures it is known that phase coexistence\nis dictated by the convexity properties of gmix (T, \u03c61 , \u03c62 )\nrelative to \u03c61 , \u03c62 . Minimization of gmix is equivalent to\nfinding g\u0303mix , the lower convex hull of gmix , that displays\nregions of three kinds. Points of the convex hull in contact with the original surface are stable monophasic regions. Regions lying above triple tangent planes corresponds to triple coexistence. The remaining part of the\nconvex hull correspond to developable patches of surface,\nwrapped around double tangent lines that connects pairs\nof points with distinct composition (tie-lines) [18]. In\npractice, we used a public domain routine, qhull, to compute a discrete approximation of g\u0303mix [19]. The starting\npoint is a fine mesh discretization of gmix over the relevant\ndomain of composition {\u03c61 , \u03c62 \u2265 0, \u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2264 1 \u2212 1/\u03b4}.\nThen qhull computes a triangulated surface approaching g\u0303mix . Triple coexistence correspond to facets with\n\n25 \u00b0c\n20 \u00b0c\n15 \u00b0c Cholesterol\nDOPC\n\n10 \u00b0c\nDPPC\n\nFIG. 2:\n(Color online) Computed evolution of the\nDPPC/DOPC/Chol triangular diagram with temperature.\nThe computed diagrams display the main expected features\nfor this lipid mixtures.\n\nall sides much larger than the initial mesh size. Double\ncoexistence is associated with elongated triangles, with a\nshortest side much smaller than the two longer sides, the\nlatter being oriented parallel with the tie-lines. Finally,\nsmall facets of the convex minimization are linked with\nstable monophasic regions. The projection of the triangulated g\u0303mix surface onto the composition plane provides\ndirectly a fast and accurate approximation of the Gibbs\nphase diagram shown in fig. 1(a). This discrete solution can then be refined according to the usual rules for\nthe determination of ternary phase diagrams. Details of\nthese calculations will be given in a forthcoming publication [15].\nArguably, the most widely studied ternary lipid phase\ndiagram for membranes containing cholesterol is the\nternary mixture DOPC/DPPC/Chol. DOPC is a double tail molecule with 18 carbons per tail and a cisunsaturated bond on the ninth carbon. It has a low main\ntransition temperature T1 at \u221221\u25e6C and an associated\nenthalpy change \u2206H1 evaluated at 7.7 kcal/mol [20].\nDPPC has also a phosphatidylcholine head but here the\ntwo 16-carbon tails have no unsaturated bonds, leading\nto a higher transition temperature T2 at 42\u25e6 C, and associated enthalpy change \u2206H2 = 8.7 kcal/mol [20]. Within\nour approach, the above temperature and enthalpy values and a single coupling parameter J \u0303 = 0.35 - see eq. (3)\n- describe well published data [21] for the experimental\nbinary DOPC/DPPC mixing behavior. For a complete\ndescription of the ternary phase diagram our model further requires three parameters: \u03b4, \u03be and \u03c7. The value of\n\u03b4 is bound by the maximum amount of cholesterol that\n\n\f4\na membrane can hold, estimated here at \u03c6C \u2243 0.45 or\nequivalently \u03b4 = 1/\u03c6C = 2.2 [3]. The parameter \u03be, as\ndefined in eq.(5), quantifies the preference of cholesterol\nfor the liquid disordered phase with respect to the gel\nphase [1, 22]. Binary diagrams of DPPC/Chol computed\nwith \u03be = 1.8 reproduce well the temperature behavior of\nthe miscibility gaps occurring between the L\u03b2 -gel phase\nand the Lo liquid ordered phase as determined from Giant Unilamellar Vesicles in [23] and from NMR [24] - see\nfig.(2). Eq.(5) also includes a repulsive m-independent\ninteraction between cholesterol and the unsaturated component, given by \u03c7. At 10\u25e6 C a value of \u03c7 = 6.0 promotes both a triple coexistence region and a large biphasic domain, with oblique Lo /Ld tie lines of positive slope\nand a plait point on the left side of the Gibbs triangle,\nin agreement with experimental findings [5]. A larger\nvalue of \u03c7 would open there a miscibility gap, unseen\nfor DOPC/Chol, while a smaller value would drastically\nreduce the biphasic Lo /Ld domain. In our model a continuous path connects the Lo and Ld regions around the\ncritical point, where the order parameter m remains positive. The L\u03b2 phase on the lower right corner of the phase\ndiagram is associated with a negative m-value and separated from the rest of the diagram by a discontinuity in\nm across the coexistence gap.\nThe evolution of the Gibbs diagram with respect to\ntemperature is displayed in fig. (2). The diagram was\ndrawn here under the assumption of a constant \u03be parameter, and a constant value of the coupling contribution\nkB T * \u03c7 denoting its pure enthalpic nature. Our diagram\nat the lower temperature in fig. (2), displays the main\nexpected features for a DOPC/DPPC/Chol mixture. As\nthe temperature increases, the triple coexistence triangle shrinks and vanishes between 15\u25e6 C and 20\u25e6 C. Also,\nthe Lo /Ld biphasic region, resting initially on the left\nside of the triangle, detaches and assumes a closed shape\nof decreasing surface. A first critical point, on the left\nside of the Gibbs diagram, evolves slowly away from the\nedge [4]. A second critical point, initially hidden by the\ntriple coexistence region, is predicted to emerge at the binary detachment temperature. Note also that within our\napproach the extension of the L\u03b2 domain, on the right\nbottom part of the diagram, gradually decreases up to\nT2 .\nAs a summary we presented a model for phase coexistence in ternary phospholipid-cholesterol mixtures. Our\napproach is based on a mean-field two-state description\nof the phospholipids and a non-ideal mixing entropy for\ncholesterol. All but one parameter in our system are\nbound by known thermodynamic or physical properties.\nWe combined analytical theory and numerical convex\n\nminimization to show the predictive power of our model\nfor the ternary mixture DOPC/DPPC/Chol. Resulting\nphase coexistence diagrams reproduce well known features for this system at 10\u25e6 C as well as the temperature\nvariation of the diagram. We are also encouraged by preliminary results from related ternary systems that further\nindicate that our model successfully describes a large variety of lipid/lipid/cholesterol mixtures.\n\u2217\n\nfabrice.thalmann@ics-cnrs.unistra.fr\n\n[1] O.
