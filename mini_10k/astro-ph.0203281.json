Associated almost exclusively with massive ellipticals, these objects\noften exhibit radio emission extending far beyond the optical extent of the host galaxies. The\nmore extreme examples span over 1 Mpc with the radio emission resembling jets or lobes. In order\nto explain these large sizes, models require an external medium to confine the radio plasma and\nassociated magnetic fields, and consequently the cluster environment with its intracluster medium\n(ICM) of hot gas is an attractive candidate. Indeed, many powerful radio galaxies are found to lie\nin clusters. However, not all powerful radio galaxies reside in known clusters of galaxies. How can\nsuch sources be explained?\nOne possible explanation is that such radio galaxies do, in fact, reside in clusters of galaxies\nbut that these clusters are simply too poor to have been included in classical catalogs. For example,\nthe lowest richness clusters in the Abell catalog (Abell 1958; Abell, Corwin, & Olowin 1989) must\ncontain at least 35 galaxies in the interval described by the cluster's third brightest galaxy to a\ngalaxy two magnitudes fainter than this galaxy. This arbitrary cutoff implies that systems which\nrepresent meaningful associations of galaxies could easily be missed, despite having environments\nnearly identical to those of the poorer clusters of the catalog.\nAdditionally, the connection between powerful radio galaxies and real galaxy overdensities\nmight be exploited to identify samples of clusters and groups. The powerful radio galaxies would be\nnearly ideal signposts, as they are observable out to very high redshifts and are nearly always found\nin the centermost regions of clusters (Ledlow & Owen 1995). In fact, studies including AllingtonSmith et al. (1993) have taken advantage of this technique. However, the picture is likely more\ncomplicated. Specifically, there is evidence that different types of powerful radio sources inhabit\ndifferent environments. For example, radio galaxies are often separated based on radio luminosity\nand morphology (and optical magnitude; see Owen & White 1991; Ledlow & Owen 1996) into FR\nI and FR II sources (Fanaroff & Riley 1974). The FR I sources appear to be more frequently\nassociated with cluster environments than FR II sources (e.g., Longair & Seldner 1979; Miller et\nal. 1999), although this may only be true at lower redshift as at higher redshift their environments\nappear more similar (e.g., Prestage & Peacock 1988). There may also be environmental differences\namong the more powerful radio galaxies (generally FR II), with some being fairly normal optically\nluminous ellipticals whereas others are clearly disturbed and apparent galaxy-galaxy merger systems\n(Heckman et al. 1986). Consequently, in order to use radio galaxies to identify samples of clusters\nand groups it appears to be important to consider the nature of the radio source.\nIn Miller et al. (1999, hereafter Paper 1) we explored these themes using a sample of nearby\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\npowerful radio galaxies which were not members of Abell clusters. The local environments of the\nradio galaxies were examined via analysis of X-ray data from the Rosat All-Sky Survey (RASS;\nsee Voges, W. 1993) and statistical measures of clustering from optical images. The X-ray data\nconfirmed that the majority of the radio sources were associated with X-ray emission. We also\nnoted a probable difference between FR I and FR II environments, with the FR I sources more\nfrequently associated with extended X-ray emission and optical overdensities of galaxies. Thus, the\nFR I sources did appear to be associated with poor clusters while the FR II sources were more\nisolated.\nIn this paper, we report on the use of multifiber spectroscopy to further investigate the environments of powerful nearby radio galaxies which are not members of classical Abell clusters. The\noptical analysis employed in Paper 1 included no velocity information, and was instead based on\nthe two-point spatial correlation function, Bgg . Velocity measurements are therefore necessary to\nconfirm the presence of poor clusters around FR I radio galaxies, and further explore the environments of radio galaxies which appear to reside in very sparse regions of galaxies. The velocities\nare used to evaluate velocity dispersions in the identified poor clusters and estimate system masses\nunder the assumption of virial equilibrium. In some cases, the obtained velocities also allow an investigation of potential substructure within the identified clusters and the relationship of the radio\nsources to such substructure. The goals are to: 1) confirm the existence of poor clusters identified\nthrough the presence of powerful radio galaxies, and 2) better understand the relationship between\nthe characteristics of the radio galaxies and their local environments.\nThe observations and reductions will be discussed briefly in Section 2, followed by the computation of quantities to characterize their environments (Section 3). A discussion of the results is\npresented in Section 4, followed by a brief summary of the conclusions. Throughout this paper, we\nhave adopted Ho = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and qo = 0.1 in all calculations which require such factors.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nData\n\nThe Sample\n\nThe complete sample is composed of 25 radio galaxies drawn from the 3CRR (Laing, Riley, &\nLongair 1983) and Wall & Peacock (1985) catalogs, plus 24 additional radio galaxies drawn from\nthe B2 catalog (Colla et al. 1970, 1972). The B2 sources are generally of lower radio luminosity,\nbut were added as the declination range of that survey made them excellent targets for observation\nat Kitt Peak. The radio galaxies were required to be nearby (z < 0.06 for the 3CRR and Wall\n& Peacock galaxies, z < 0.04 for the B2 galaxies), and not members of Abell clusters. We report\non a subset of 25 of these radio galaxies in this paper. The remainder were unobservable due to\ndeclination limits of the telescope (6 sources) and observing time lost due to weather. The full\nsample of radio galaxies and comments on their properties may be found in Table 1.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n2.2.\n\nObservations and Reductions\n\nSpectra were obtained using the MX Spectrometer on the Steward Observatory 2.3 meter Bok\ntelescope. MX utilizes 2\u2032\u2032 fibers on mechanical probes to obtain spectra of up to 32 targets at once,\nplus sky spectra from 30 fibers \"piggy-backed\" to target spectra probes. The field of view of the\ntelescope with MX is 45\u2032 , which matches nicely with the angular sizes of the poor clusters being\nstudied. In 18 of the 25 systems being studied this corresponds to a linear size of 1 Mpc or greater,\nwhile for the nearest system it is \u223c 0.8 Mpc. The actual spectrograph is the Steward Observatory\nBoller & Chivens spectrograph, which rests on the dome floor. Using a 400 lines mm\u22121 grating,\n3300\u00c5 coverage is obtained at a resolution of about 6\u00c5. The wavelength center for the observations\nwas typically around 5400\u00c5, which covered from [OII]\u03bb3727 to [SII]\u03bb\u03bb6717 + 6731 for the small\nredshifts of the sample. Additional details on the MX instrument may be found in Hill & Lesser\n(1986, 1988).\nTargets were selected from the Digitized Sky Survey plates, and corresponded to galaxies with\nmagnitudes near that of the radio galaxy. In all but one case (B2 0120+33), the fields around\nthe radio galaxies were sparse enough that all relatively bright galaxies could be observed through\na single pointing of the telescope. The integration time for each pointing was one hour. Upon\ncompletion of each science exposure, comparison lamp arc spectra and continuum fiber flats (used\nto accurately locate the apertures corresponding to each fiber on the CCD) were obtained.\nData reduction was performed following the usual steps. On each night of observations, a\nsequence of 10 zero-second exposures and a sequence of 10 exposures of a quartz lamp (taken through\na diffuser placed below the slit) were taken to create a master bias frame and flat field, respectively.\nThe extracted spectra were wavelength calibrated using the arc lamp exposures, producing rms\nerrors of under 0.2\u00c5 (determined from \u223c 30 lines and confirmed via inspection of airglow lines).\nThe 30 sky fibers from each pointing were combined to create a super-sky spectrum (after rejecting\nany fibers which chanced to lie upon stars or galaxies), which was iteratively subtracted from each\nspectrum until the [OI] night sky line at 5577\u00c5 was entirely removed.\n\n2.3.\n\nInspection of Spectra and Velocity Measurements\n\nEach spectrum was carefully inpected in IRAF. Artifacts from cosmic rays and bad columns\non the CCD were excised from the spectra, and velocity measurement then followed one of two\nprocedures. First, some of the observed galaxies had spectra including emission lines such as the\nBalmer lines and forbidden oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur lines. When such lines were present,\nvelocities and errors were obtained using known laboratory wavelengths of such species. In these\ncalculations, all lines were assigned equal weight in the determination of a galaxy's velocity and the\nestimate of the error in this quantity is simply the dispersion of the values obtained for individual\nlines. A minimum velocity error of 20 km s\u22121 was adopted as an upper limit, based on the\nuncertainty of our wavelength solutions. For the majority of the galaxies, emission lines were\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nnot present or were too weak to be useful in velocity characterization. Radial velocities for such\ngalaxies were determined via fourier cross-correlation (Tonry & Davis 1979) using known velocity\nstandards. A set of templates including M31, M32, NGC 3379, NGC 7331, and the brightest\ngalaxies from several nearby clusters were used as the velocity standards, with the cross correlations\nusing wavelengths between 3700\u00c5 and 6750\u00c5 (minus small regions centered on the prominent night\nsky lines at 5577\u00c5 and 6300\u00c5). Each galaxy spectrum was cross correlated against each template\nspectrum, and the resulting velocities were 3\u03c3 clipped. Final velocities were assigned if at least 60%\nof the templates produced a consistent velocity with an internal dispersion among the individual\nmeasurements that was less than 250 km s\u22121 . In general, the proximity of the targets resulted in\nR & 8 (see Tonry & Davis). Velocity errors were assigned using the formula 280(1 + R)\u22121 (Tonry\n& Davis and Oegerle & Hill 1998), again with a minimum of 20 km s\u22121 . Finally, each galaxy\nvelocity was confirmed via visual inspection through identification of major features such as the\n4000\u00c5 break and prominent absorption features such as the G band, MgII, and NaD.\nThe relative proximity of the sample meant that velocities for some galaxies in the fields\nof the radio galaxies had already been measured. Consequently, we obtained velocities from the\nNASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) for galaxies within 1 Mpc of the radio galaxy positions.\nFor galaxies in the field of 3C31 we have adopted the velocities of Ledlow et al. (1996), since these\nobservations were made using the same telescope and detector.\nTable 2 presents the results for all galaxies deemed to be associated with the radio galaxies\n(see Section 3). The same information for foreground and background galaxies may be found in\nTable 3. If emission lines were present in the spectrum, they are noted in the final column. When\nsuch lines were not used in the velocity calculation, they are offset by parentheses.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nAnalysis\n\nVelocity Completeness\n\nThe primary goals of this study are to confirm the presence of poor clusters around the radio\ngalaxies and better understand the connection of these galaxies to their local environments. For\nthese purposes, the biases inherent in our sampling of galaxy velocities should not be too important.\nHowever, it is instructive to examine the completeness of our velocity data. Hence, we evaluate\nthe fraction of galaxies with measured velocities as a function of optical magnitude and radial\nseparation from the radio galaxies.\nGalaxy identifications and magnitudes are available for 21 of the 25 radio galaxy fields in the\nAutomated Plate Scanner (APS) catalogs (for a description of the scanner and procedure, see Pennington et al. 1993). The other fields are generally too close to the Galactic plane, causing difficulty\nin star/galaxy segregation. We have obtained identifications and magnitudes for all galaxies located\nwithin a projected separation of 1 Mpc of the radio galaxies and used them to evaluate the com-\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\npleteness of our velocity data. Table 4 presents the results, including the limiting magnitude (Rc ,\nderived from the Palomar \"E\" plates) below which we have velocity data for all galaxies (including\nthose not associated with the radio galaxies). Information is provided for all galaxies within 1 Mpc\nof the radio galaxies, in addition to those within 500 kpc and 250 kpc. Our velocity information is\nmore complete in the central regions of the radio galaxy fields, as these were more likely to be the\ntarget of our spectroscopic observations. For galaxies within 1 Mpc of the radio galaxy, our average\nlimiting magnitude is 15.3 (for comparison, the radio galaxies range from 11.2 \u2264 mR \u2264 14.6). The\nfainter galaxies with spectra of high enough S/N to obtain accurate velocity measurements typically\nhave mR \u223c 17. Within 250 kpc of the radio galaxies, the limiting magnitude has dropped to an\naverage of 16.1. Therefore, we conclude that the spectroscopy in these fields adequately samples\nthe velocity fields in the vicinity of the radio galaxies.\nA related issue is the confirmation of the statistical results from Paper 1. In that study,\ncounts of the brighter galaxies in the radio galaxy fields were used to evaluate Bgg . The velocity\ndata confirm that for three of the six fields in common between these studies (3C 293, 3C 296,\n1615+351; 3C 386 is too close to the Galactic plane to be included in the APS catalog) all of the\ngalaxies used in the Bgg calculations are cluster members. In a fourth (3C 31), nine out of ten are\nconfirmed cluster members, a result consistent with the estimate of background galaxies in the Bgg\ncalculation. The remaining source (3C 305) had seven possible members in the Bgg analysis, of\nwhich only three were cluster members. Thus, the statistical evidence for clustering in this radio\ngalaxy field was misleading. However, 3C 305 was shown to not be associated with extended X-ray\nemission and was therefore a poor candidate for a true cluster system.\n\n3.2.\n\nDerived Quantities: Systemic Velocities, Velocity Dispersions, and Virial\nMasses\n\nThe systemic velocities and velocity dispersions were calculated using 3\u03c3 rejection (Yahil &\nVidal 1977). Due to the low number of velocities available, we have adopted the Biweight estimators\nof location and scale (CBI and SBI , respectively) instead of the simple mean and standard deviation\n(Beers, Flynn, & Gebhardt 1990). These estimators are less sensitive to the presence of outliers,\nand are consequently better suited to the identification of real systems. The 1\u03c3 confidence intervals\nin the biweight scale and location were estimated using the jackknife method (Mosteller & Tukey\n1977). In all subsequent discussion, the terms systemic velocity and velocity dispersion will be used\nfor CBI and SBI . It should be noted that other algorithms exist; for example, the \"DEDICA\"\nmethod which uses the data to estimate the underlying probability density and thereby identify\nclusters and assign probabilities that individual galaxies are members (Pisani 1993).\nThe results may be found in Table 5. Since the radio galaxies may exist in localized substructures within richer environments or the velocity dispersions might be artificially high should\nunassociated groups be evaluated together, all quantities have been determined for both a 1 Mpc\nradius and a 250 kpc radius centered on the radio galaxy. It should be noted that the values for\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nthe 250 kpc aperture have not had an additional 3\u03c3 clipping performed, but were simply calculated\nusing the culled lists derived from the 1 Mpc apertures. Figure 1 presents velocity histograms for\nall of the observed radio galaxy fields, using the 1 Mpc radius. In these figures, a range in velocity\nof \u00b12000 km s\u22121 with a bin size of 200 km s\u22121 is shown. Verified cluster members are represented\nas the shaded portion of the histogram, with foreground and background galaxies unshaded. An\noverlaid Gaussian with center and dispersion corresponding to the systemic velocity and velocity\ndispersion of the system is also depicted for each field. Lastly, the arrows denote the locations of\nthe radio galaxies.\nIn two cases, the 3\u03c3 clipping placed the radio galaxy outside of its apparent system. Most\nnotably, B2 1322+36 was clipped from a system at 5,625 km s\u22121 . The overall system appears\nto consist of nine members, with six of the galaxies tightly grouped in velocity space. These six\ngalaxies produce a velocity dispersion of only 30 km s\u22121 , placing the radio galaxy velocity of 5,210\nkm s\u22121 outside of the identified group. Other methods would likely include all of these galaxies in\nthe identified system; in fact, the system has also been noted in prior group studies (e.g., White et\nal. 1999) which included the radio galaxy among its members. Simple usage of the standard mean\nand deviation (including 3\u03c3 clipping) produce a single nine galaxy system with cz = 5614 km s\u22121\nand \u03c3 = 200 km s\u22121 . We therefore conclude that this is likely a loose system dominated by a group\nof galaxies strongly clustered in velocity space. The other radio galaxy which was clipped from a\nnearby system was 3C 305. It lies near a pair of galaxies at approximately the same velocity.\nThe distributions and velocities of the galaxies were also used to estimate the masses of the\npotential clusters, under the assumption of virial equilibrium. The virial masses were calculated\nusing the standard equation:\n3\u03c0 2 1 \u22121\n\u03c3 h i\n(1)\nM =\nG\nr\nwhere the harmonic mean radius is defined as\n\uf8f6\u22121\n\uf8eb\nN\nX\n1 \u22121\n1\n\uf8f8\nh i\n= DL Np \uf8ed\n(2)\nr\n\u03b8ij\ni<j\n\nand Np is the number of galaxy pairs (N (N \u2212 1)/2), \u03b8ij is the angular separation of each ij pair,\nDL is the distance of the cluster, and \u03c3 is the line of sight velocity dispersion. Errors in the velocity\ndispersions were propagated into the mass estimates. The resulting values were converted into units\nof solar masses and may be found in Table 5. We have not applied any \"surface term correction\"\nto the mass estimates (The & White 1986) because this correction requires knowledge of the mass\ndensity profiles. The mass density profile would be obtained from some assumption of how well\nthe galaxies trace the mass and how well the overall galaxy distribution is sampled. In addition,\nshould substructure be present in the clusters (see Section 3.3) application of the virial theorem is\nobviously inaccurate. These factors tend to produce an overestimate of the true mass. Thus, the\nformal errors are larger than those quoted in Table 5. Given these caveats, the masses are generally\ntypical of groups and poor clusters, ranging up to \u223c 3 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 .\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.3.\n\nSimple Dynamical Analysis\n\nA potentially important factor in assessing the environment of the radio galaxies is their\nlocations within any surrounding clusters. Specifically, with the velocity data in hand we may ask\nwhether the radio galaxies appear to be at rest within the clusters or have some relative motion.\nRelative motion between the host galaxy and the intracluster medium is required in order to explain\ncertain radio morphologies, such as the bending of tails. In particular, narrow-angle tail (NAT)\nmorphologies require substantial relative motion. However, in general we might expect the radio\ngalaxies to be nearly at rest as they are often associated with the most massive elliptical galaxies\nin their fields.\nUsing the systemic velocities and errors along with the velocities and errors for the radio\ngalaxies, the significance at which the radio galaxy velocities differed from those of their host\nclusters was determined. Most of the radio galaxies were shown to lie at the velocity centers of\ntheir systems (15 of 25 within 1\u03c3, including those systems with three or fewer velocities). Only three\nof the radio galaxies (B2 0222+36, B2 1321+31, and B2 1322+36) appear to have velocities which\ndiffer by more than 2\u03c3 from the velocities of their assumed systems. The result is similar when\nassessing only those galaxies within 250 kpc of the radio sources (B2 0222+36, B2 1322+36, and\n1615+351 had greater than 2\u03c3 velocity offsets). It is perhaps not surprising that these three radio\nsources are the only ones in the sample which are not the brightest galaxies in their respective fields.\nHowever, the low number of velocities for most of the radio galaxy fields in the sample prevents\nany strong conclusions (see Table 5 for numbers of spectroscopically-identified velocities).\nSeveral of the identified groups have fairly large numbers of measured velocities. Zabludoff &\nMulchaey (1998b) investigated six poor groups with large numbers of measured velocites (Ngal \u2265 30)\nto evaluate hierarchical evolution. Using the \u2206 test (Dressler & Shectman 1988) they confirmed\nthat evidence for substructure was present in two of the poor groups, arguing that these systems\nevolve hierarchically in much the same way as richer systems such as Abell clusters. Because the\npresence of substructure has been shown to be linked to radio activity in tailed radio galaxies\n(G\u00f3mez et al. 1997; Bliton et al. 1998; Pinkney et al. 2000), we have applied substructure tests to\nthose groups with more than 20 velocities: B2 0120+33 (65 velocities), B2 1621+38 (24 velocities),\n3C31 (52 velocities), 3C296 (21 velocities), and 1615+351 (38 velocities).\nA battery of statistical tests for substructure were performed (for a complete listing of the tests\nperformed see Pinkney et al. 1996, PRBB96). These tests include a number of normality tests (i.e.,\ncomparison of the distribution of velocities with a normal distribution; see the \"ROSTAT\" routines\nof Beers, Flynn, & Gebhardt 1990), tests for substructure in spatial distribution (right ascension\nand declination), and tests combining both velocity and spatial information. The significance of\nany detected substructure for the two- and three-dimensional tests was quantified by comparison\nagainst 1000 Monte Carlo shuffles of the actual data. Thus, each statistic calculated using the\nreal data was compared to 1000 Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate how likely it occured relative\nto the null hypothesis of no substructure. For the two-dimensional tests, this null hypothesis is\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\na smooth, azimuthally-symmetric distribution of galaxies. No correlation between galaxy position\nand velocity is the null hypothesis for the three-dimensional tests. The quoted significance level\nrepresents how often the test result for the actual data had more substructure than the Monte\nCarlo shuffles. We adopted a level of 99% as significant (as per the conclusions of PRBB96), or\nfewer than 1 out of every 100 Monte Carlo simulations showing greater substructure than the real\ndata.\nFor the most part, evidence for significant substructure was not found. For B2 0120+33, the\n2D and 3D Lee tests (Lee 1979; Fitchett 1988, PRBB96) were each significant at about 95%, and the\nAngular Separation Test (West, Oemler, & Dekel 1988) was significant at about 98%. In total, this\nrepresents marginal evidence for the presence of substructure in this cluster. Similarly, 3C 31 had a\n\u03b2 test (West, Oemler, & Dekel 1988) that was significant at 98% and B2 1621+38 had an Angular\nSeparation Test signficant at 99%. No other tests were above 90% significance, as was the case\nfor all tests applied to 3C 296. The strongest evidence for substructure was found in 1615+351.\nIts galaxy distribution appears to be elongated, as the Fourier Elongation Test (PRBB96) was\nsignificant at well over 99% confidence. Furthermore, its Lee 2D and 3D tests were also significant\nat about the 99% level. While the Fourier test merely identifies an elongated distribution of galaxies\nwhich may or may not be caused by substructure and merging, the Lee tests are insensitive to such\ndistributions. Hence, the combination of these tests argue for the presence of real substructure.\nThe normality tests (based only on velocities) did not show evidence for substructure, although the\nvelocity of the radio galaxy differed from that of the parent cluster by 1.9\u03c3 (3.4\u03c3 from the galaxies\nwithin 250 kpc).\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe majority of the radio galaxies appear to reside in poor clusters or groups. Nineteen of 25\nexamined fields consisted of at least five galaxies with velocities placing them in a system including\nthe radio galaxy (twenty if we include B2 1322+36). In fact, over half of the fields (14 of 25)\nhad in excess of 10 members, and five had more than 20 members. Two of the radio galaxies, B2\n0120+33 and 3C 31, were shown to reside in very rich systems with 65 and 52 confirmed velocities,\nrespectively.\nThe calculated velocity dispersions and virial masses further indicate that the radio galaxies\ntend to exist in groups and poor clusters. Figure 2 depicts histograms of the derived velocity\ndispersions for each the 250 kpc and 1 Mpc counting radii. About a third of the fields have\ndispersions around 200 km s\u22121 , consistent with the values found for nearby groups (e.g., nearly 400\nloose groups identified from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey have a median velocity dispersion\nof 164 km s\u22121 and a median mass of about 2.5 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 ; Tucker et al. 2000). Most of the\nradio-selected groups in the present study have velocity dispersions and masses in excess of these\nvalues, and more consistent with the velocity dispersions found for groups and poor clusters (e.g.,\nLedlow et al. 1996; Zabludoff & Mulchaey 1998a). The overall distribution of velocity dispersions\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nis similar to that found by Ledlow et al., who found a median dispersion of 295 \u00b1 31 km s\u22121 for\na set of optically-selected poor clusters. In the present sample, we find a median of 452 \u00b1 161 km\ns\u22121 (using only the 20 clusters with five or more velocities, to be consistent with Ledlow et al.).\nWhile these values indicate the presence of slightly richer environments around the radio galaxies,\nit must be noted that Ledlow et al. used a smaller 0.5 Mpc counting radius. The richer among\nthe radio-selected groups have dispersions and masses in line with the poorer Abell clusters. The\nmedian velocity dispersion of the richness class 0 clusters reported in Zabludoff, Huchra, & Geller\n(1991) is around 500 km s\u22121 , a value which is exceeded by seven of the radio groups in our sample.\nThe median velocity dispersion for richness class 1 clusters in the same study is about 725 km s\u22121 ,\nwhich is in excess of any of the velocity dispersions for our radio galaxy fields. Thus, the radio\ngalaxies generally reside in structures ranging from groups on up through the poorer Abell clusters.\nGalaxy groups have received a great deal of attention in the literature as their high local\ndensities and low velocity dispersions make them attractive sites for galaxy evolution. It is therefore\nnot surprising that many of the radio galaxy fields have been associated with groups in prior studies.\nFor example, eight of the 25 fields studied in this work are noted in White et al. (1999, \"WBL\"\nclusters), and a similar number are reported in Mahdavi et al. (2000, the \"RASSCALS\"). It is also\ninteresting to note that the radio galaxy poor clusters are frequently associated with larger-scale\nstructures. At least four are associated with the Pisces-Perseus supercluster and another two are\nassociated with known groups at the periphery of Abell 2197 and 2199. Even with these prior\nidentifications, a number of the radio-selected poor clusters appear to be new. Our data more than\ndouble the number of velocities for six of the fields which previously had five or fewer publiclyavailable velocities. The most striking example is 3C 296, to which we have added sixteen cluster\nvelocities to the previously known five.\nHowever, five of the fields produced three or fewer member velocities, indicating that these radio\ngalaxies are almost certainly not in groups or poor clusters. How can these objects be explained?\nAs noted previously, the nature of the radio source is an additional parameter of importance (refer\nto Table 1). Two of the five (B2 0207+38 and B2 1318+34) are powered by star formation and not\nan AGN. Optical images show them to be spirals, and their spectra (see Figure 3a and 3b) show\nstrong emission of H\u03b1. In fact, Poggianti & Wu (2000) discuss B2 0207+38 as a nearby example\nof a strong dust-extincted starburst and Condon et al. (1991) demonstrate that B2 1318+34 is a\nmerger-induced starburst. The remaining three radio galaxies in very poor environments are all\nAGN, but differ from the more typical radio sources of the sample. Both 3C 293 and 3C 305 are\ngalaxy-galaxy merger systems (Heckman et al. 1986; Evans et al. 1999), with strong dust features\nand signs of disturbance (Martel et al. 1999). Most of the radio emission from 3C 293 is contained\nwithin a bright central core and all of the radio emission from 3C 305 is contained within the\noptical extent of the galaxy, making the radio morphologies of these sources distinctly different\nfrom classical FR I galaxies. They also exhibit evidence for star formation, including large amounts\nof far-infrared emission, the presence of large amounts of molecular gas (Evans et al. 1999), and\nemission lines in their optical spectra (see Figure 3c). The remaining radio galaxy which appears\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nto be fairly isolated is 3C 386. Although the arguments are weaker, it has some similarities with 3C\n293 and 3C 305. Its radio morphology is that of a relaxed double, with a bright core surrounded\nby diffuse emission over a large area. Consequently, it is not a classical FR I type radio source.\nAn additional three of the radio galaxies have LINER spectra (B2 0222+36, B2 0258+35,\nand B2 1422+26). In general, these are also located in poorer environments than the classical FR\nI radio sources. Both B2 0258+35 and B2 1422+26 have only five confirmed members, and B2\n0222+36 resides in a system with 14 confirmed members. However, the local environment of this\nlatter source may be more complicated. It is not the brightest galaxy in its field, and appears to\nhave a velocity which is offset from systemic velocity. The small number of velocities prohibits any\nstatistical statements, but this system might be a pair of groups - one which includes the radio\ngalaxy and another which includes the brighter galaxy.\nThe rest of the radio galaxies generally show classical FR I morphologies, including jets of\nradio emission which extend past the optical boundaries of the galaxies. Optically, they all have\nabsorption-line spectra indicative of older stellar populations. With the exception of B2 1322+36,\nall of these galaxies have velocity dispersions in excess of 200 km s\u22121 indicating their presence in\nstructures ranging from the size of groups on up through poor Abell clusters, with virial masses\nfrom about 2 \u00d7 1013 to 3 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 . This result is in agreement with the conclusions of Paper\n1: the presence of an FR I radio source is an excellent indicator of an underlying group or poor\ncluster2 .\nTwo of the FR I radio sources (B2 1621+38 and 1615+351) have NAT morphologies. They\nare located in two of the richer environments of the sample, and each have associated diffuse Xray emission (Feretti et al. 1995). Bliton et al. (1998) examined NAT sources drawn from a large\nsample of Abell clusters and noted that clusters with NATs were more likely to have substructure\nthan radio-quiet clusters. Coalescence of substructures can produce the large relative motions\nbetween NAT host galaxies and the intracluster gas necessary to explain the radio morphologies of\nsuch sources. For B2 1621+38, there is only slight evidence for substructure, a result undoubtedly\nrelated to the somewhat limited number of velocites (24) in our study. The situation is improved for\n1615+351, with its 38 velocities producing several significant results (see Section 3.3). In addition,\nthe radio galaxy is the second brightest galaxy in the field, with the brightest being NGC 6107.\nThis galaxy is also a radio source (Ekers et al. 1978), although it is weaker than 1615+351. Figure\n4 plots the galaxy distribution for 1615+351. The elongation is evident, running from SW to NE\n(which is also consistent with the diffuse X-ray emission; Feretti et al. 1995). A clump of galaxies\nat lower velocities than the cluster center is seen to the NE. For reference, the radio emission points\naway from the galaxy toward the NW. In total, these results indicate that the NATs in our study\nappear to be found in clusters with substructure, consistent with the findings for NATs in Abell\nclusters.\n2\n\nAs an aside we note that B2 1652+39, often classified as a BL Lac, resides in an environment consistent with the\nclassical FR I sources of the sample. This is the expected result from FR I\u2013BL Lac unification scenarios.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nIn general, the stronger radio sources (i.e., after removing star forming galaxies) can be split\ninto two idealized categories as initially suggested by Heckman et al. (1986). The first class includes\nthe more powerful radio galaxies, with radio emission concentrated in a central core but often\nincluding diffuse emission on larger scales. These galaxies frequently have optical emission lines\nand reside in regions of low galaxy density. They often exhibit signs of disturbance related to recent\ngalaxy-galaxy merging, presumably with at least one of the merger partners a disk galaxy which\nprovides a reservoir of gas to fuel the AGN. The second class are FR I type sources, which appear\nmore like typical large ellipticals and reside in regions of high galaxy density. Their radio emission\nextends well past the optical limits of the host galaxies in distinct jet-like structures. Of course,\nthe situation is more complex as not all radio galaxies can easily be pigeon-holed into these two\ncategories.\nUnfortunately, our present sample includes no clear FR II galaxies with bright lobes of radio\nemission. The infrequency of such sources implies that there are very few within the redshift cutoffs\nwe have applied. Such galaxies appear to reside in regions of lower galaxy density, at least for the\nlow redshifts examined in this study. In the future, a comprehensive study of the environments of\nnearby FR II sources would do much to help understand the possible differences in the environments\nof FR I and FR II radio galaxies.\nThe placement of fibers on any galaxies within the fields of the radio galaxies also produced\na number of velocities for apparent background groups and clusters. The presence of such systems\nmay be inferred from Table 3. As an example, the observation of B2 1652+39 appears to have\nnetted seven velocities for the cluster Abell 2235. The cluster is presumably located at \u03b1 =16:54:58\nand \u03b4 =40:01:16 (Abell, Corwin, & Olowin 1989) which is under 22 minutes from the field center of\nour observations. Struble & Rood (1999) report that this cluster has a systemic velocity of 45,300\nkm s\u22121 , determined from three published velocities. From our seven velocities, we find a systemic\n\u22121\nvelocity of 44,454\u00b1120 km s\u22121 with a dispersion of 197+149\n\u221285 km s . There is also extended X-ray\nemission associated with this cluster, as indicated by its presence in cluster list generated from the\nROSAT All-Sky Survey (identified as RX J1652.6+4011; Bohringer et al. 2000).\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper, we have confirmed that powerful radio galaxies are excellent signposts to the\npresence of clusters of galaxies. Using a sample of 25 radio galaxies drawn from the 3CRR and\nB2 catalogs, our velocity measurements determined that 80% (20/25) consisted of at least five\ngalaxies. Over half of the fields (14/25) had in excess of 10 members, with some having as many\nas 50 members. The derived velocity dispersions are consistent with those derived for groups and\npoor clusters. In particular, we note that radio galaxies with classical FR I morphologies seem\nto reside exclusively in group and poor cluster environments. The few radio galaxies which exist\nin regions of particularly low galaxy density are either vigorous star-forming galaxies or complex\ngalaxy-galaxy mergers. These results confirm our prior findings which were based on statistical\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nmeasures of galaxy clustering and the presence of extended X-ray emission.\nThe small sample of radio galaxy fields examined here provides additional clues regarding\nthe formation and evolution of powerful radio galaxies. When the radio galaxies powered by star\nformation are removed from the sample, there are two general types of radio sources. The first\nclass, which consists of more classical FR I radio galaxies which exhibit clear jets of radio emission,\nare found in regions of increased galaxy density. These regions have intracluster gas, as inferred\nthrough X-ray observations, and this gas can confine the radio plasma emitted by the radio galaxy.\nThe second class of radio galaxy resides in regions of low galaxy density. They often exhibit optical\nemission lines and evidence for recent merger activity. Thus, environment seems to play a key\nrole in determining the class of the radio galaxy. This picture is clearly an oversimplification, but\ngenerally explains our results. One important further area of study is how more classical FR II\nsources, with large lobes of bright radio emission, fit into this picture.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nThe authors thank Dennis Means and Vic Hansen for their assistance during the observations,\nJason Pinkney for providing the computer code used in the analysis of possible substructures,\nand an anonymous referee for comments which substantially improved the focus of the paper.\nNAM thanks the National Radio Astronomy Observatory for financial assistance in the form of a\npredoctoral scholarship.\nThe Digitized Sky Survey was produced at the Space Telescope Science Institute under U.S.\nGovernment grant NAG W-2166.
