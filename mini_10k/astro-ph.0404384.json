Introduction\nClassical Cepheids are the cornerstone of the extragalactic distance scale. Thanks to their characteristic Period-Luminosity\n(PL) and Period-Luminosity-Color (PLC) relations they are traditionally used to derive the distances to Local Group galaxies,\nand (with the advent of space observations) to external galaxies distant up to about 25 Mpc (targets of a Hubble Space\nTelescope Key Project, see Freedman et al. 1997, 2001). As\nprimary indicators they are used to calibrate a number of secondary distance indicators (see e.g. Freedman et al. 2001)\nreaching the region of the so called Hubble flow where the\nHubble law can be applied and an estimate of the Hubble constant can be derived.\nMoreover, the comparison between Cepheid physical parameters (stellar mass, luminosity, chemical composition) based on\nevolutionary and pulsation models supplies the unique opportunity to pin point the occurrence of deceptive systematic errors\n(Bono et al. 2001a; Moskalik 2000) on the Cepheid distance\nscale.\nIn particular radius determinations are important to constrain\nboth the intrinsic luminosity, through the application of the\nStefan-Boltzmann law, provided that an effective temperature\ncalibration is available, and the stellar mass, by adopting a\nPeriod-Mass-Radius relation (e.g. Bono et al. 2001).\nSend offprint requests to: Vincenzo Ripepi\n\nMany investigations have been devoted during the last decade\nto the derivation of accurate Period-Radius (PR) relations for\nClassical Cepheids both from the empirical (see e.g. Laney\n& Stobie 1995; Gieren, Fouqu\u00e9, & Gomez 1998; Ripepi et\nal. 1997) and the theoretical (Bono, Caputo, Marconi 1998;\nMarconi et al. 2003) point of view.\nEmpirical Cepheid radii are generally derived either by means\nof the Baade Wesselink (BW) method (Moffet & Barnes 1987,\nRipepi et al. 1997; Gieren et al. 1998, just to list a few examples) both in the classical form and in subsequent modified versions, or with interferometric coupled with trigonometric parallaxes techniques (Nordgren, Armstrong & German 2000, Lane,\nCreech-Eakman & Nordgren 2002).\nThe latter method is more direct and less model dependent but\nup to now it has been applied only to a limited number of stars.\nOn the other hand, the different versions of the BW technique\ncan be applied to relatively large Cepheid samples but require\nboth accurate photometric and radial velocity data.\nA powerful modification of the BW technique is the so called\nCORS method (Caccin et al. 1981), which has the advantage of\ntaking into account the whole light curve rather than selecting\nphase points at the same color (as in the classical BW implementation), but relies on the adoption of an accurate Surface\nBrightness (SB) calibration.\nOriginally Sollazzo et al., (1981) adopted the empirical SB\nphotometric calibration in the Walraven system provided by\n\n\f2\n\nA. Ruoppo et al.: Improvement of the CORS method for Cepheids radii determination based on Str\u00f6mgren photometry\n\nPel (1978). More recently Ripepi et al. (1997) modified the\nmethod, by adopting the empirical calibration of the reduced\nsurface brightness FV as a function of (V \u2212 R) provided by\nBarnes, Evans & Parson (1976). This modified version of\nthe CORS method was tested, for different colors selections,\nthrough the application to synthetic light and radial velocity\ncurves based on nonlinear convective pulsation models (Ripepi\net al. 2000).\nThe recent release of new Cepheid data in the Str\u00f6mgren photometric system (Arellano-Ferro et al. 1998), and the known\nsensitivity of intermediate band colors to stellar physical parameters (e.g. gravity and effective temperature) suggested us\nto investigate the possibility of extending the CORS method to\nthe Str\u00f6mgren filters.\nTo this purpose we have derived, in this system, a SB calibration based on model atmosphere tabulations. In this paper\nwe present a modified version of the CORS method based on\nthis new calibration and the application to a sample of Galactic\nCepheids.\nThe organization of the paper is the following: in Sect. 2 we\nsummarize the assumptions and the philosophy of the traditional CORS method; in Sect. 3 we introduce the modified\nCORS method based on the new SB calibration; in Sect. 4 we\ntest the new method by means of pulsation models; in Sect.\n5 we apply the method to a sample of Galactic Cepheids and\npresent the comparison with the literature; in Sect. 6 our final\nresults concerning the PR relation for Galactic Cepheids are\nshown and the theoretical fit of observed light and radial velocity variations for Cepheid Y Oph is used as an additional check.\nSome final remarks close the paper.\n\ndiscussion in Ripepi et al. 1997).\nFrom Eq.(2) we can evaluate the radius R0 at an arbitrary phase\n\u03c60 (usually taken at the minimum of the radial velocity curve),\nwhereas the mean radius is obtained by integrating twice the\nradial velocity curve.\nThe B term can be easily calculated from observed light and\ncolor curves. On the contrary, the \u2206B term, which includes the\nSurface Brightness, is not directly observable. By neglecting it\nin Eq. (2), we obtain the pure Baade-Wesselink method (see\nCaccin et al. 1981). However, Sollazzo et al. (1981) and Ripepi\net al. (1997, hereinafter RBMR) demonstrated that the inclusion of \u2206B improves the accuracy of radius estimates, provided\nthat S V is evaluated at each pulsation phase.\n\n3. An Improvement of the CORS method based on\nthe Str\u00f6mgren photometry\n\n3.1. Evaluation of the \u2206B term\nAs outlined in the previous section, the inclusion of \u2206B improves the accuracy of radius estimates. In this section we\npresent a new good approximation for this term.\nAs discussed by Onnembo et. (1985), if the quasi-static approximation (QSA) 1 is assumed for Cepheid atmospheres, any\nphotometric quantity can be expressed as a function of effective\ntemperature and gravity (T e f f , ge f f ); Then we can write:\nS V = S V (T e f f , ge f f )\n\n(5)\n\nand\n\n2. The original CORS method\n\nci j = ci j (T e f f , ge f f )\nckl = ckl (T e f f , ge f f )\n\nIn this section we briefly outline the assumptions and the main\nfeatures of the CORS method in order to better understand what\nfollows.\nThe CORS method (Caccin et al., 1981) starts from the definition of the surface brightness:\n\nwhere S V is the surface brightness in the visual band, and\nci j = (mi \u2212 m j ), ckl = (mk \u2212 ml ) are two arbitrary colors.\nIf the last two equations are invertible, i.e the Jacobian\nJ(T e f f , ge f f |Ci j , Chl ) , 0, then we can invert Eqs. (6), obtaining:\n\nS V = V + 5 * log \u03b1\n\n(1)\n\nT e f f = T e f f (ci j , ckl )\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the angular diameter of the star. For a variable star,\nEq.(1) is valid for the whole pulsational cycle, so that differentiating it with respect to the phase (\u03c6), multiplying by a color\nindex (Ci j ) and integrating over the whole cycle, one obtains:\nZ 1 \u001a\nZ \u03c6\n\u001b\nq\nln R0 \u2212 k P\nv(\u03c6\u2032 ) d\u03c6\u2032 Ci\u2032 j d\u03c6\n\nge f f = ge f f (ci j , ckl )\n\n0\n\n\u03c60\n\n\u2212B + \u2206B = 0\n\n(2)\n\n5\nln 10\n\nwhere q =\nZ 1\nCi j (\u03c6) m\u2032V (\u03c6) d\u03c6\nB=\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\n\u2206B =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nCi j (\u03c6) S V\u2032 (\u03c6) d\u03c6\n\n(4)\n\nwhere P is the period, v the radial velocity and k is the radial\nvelocity projection factor which relates radial to pulsation velocity (R\u2032 (\u03c6) = \u2212k * P * v(\u03c6)). The typical value for k is 1.36 (see\n\n(7)\n\nand hence\nS V = S V (ci j , ckl )\n\n(8)\n\nWe point out that Eqs. (6) do not admit a general solution over\nthe whole parameter space, given that the same colors can be\nobtained for different pairs of T e f f and ge f f . This notwithstanding it is possible to find a local solution, that is a solution valid\nonly in the parameter space defined by Cepheids.\nA potentially advantageous choice for the colors ci j , ckl\ncould be represented by the Str\u00f6mgren reddening free indexes\n1\n\n1\n\n(6)\n\nWe recall that a sufficient condition for the validity of the QSA is\nthat the atmosphere of the pulsating star can be described, at any time,\nby a classical hydrostatic, plane parallel model in radiative/convective\nequilibrium and local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (LTE), identified\nby the effective temperature T e f f and by the effective gravity ge f f =\n2\nGM\n+ ddt2R\nR2\n\n\fA.

A grid of lines at constant T e f f and constant log g in the\ntheoretical [m1 ], [c1 ] plane.\n\n3\n\nFig. 2. Theoretical grids in the [m1 ], [c1 ] plane, compared with\nthe empirical loops of three stars with period shorter than 10 d.\n\n[m1 ] and [c1 ] defined as follows (Crawford & Mandwewala\n1976):\n[m1 ] = m1 + 0.33(b \u2212 y)\n\n(9)\n\n[c1 ] = c1 \u2212 0.16(b \u2212 y)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the coefficients 0.33 and \u22120.16 are suitable for F\nsupergiant stars (Gray 1991).\nIn this context, an interesting possibility to derive Eqs.\n(7), consists in using grids of theoretical colors, calculated by\nmeans of model atmospheres, to obtain T e f f and ge f f as a function of [m1 ] and [c1 ].\nTo verify this possibility, we have adopted the grids of theoretical colors by Castelli, Gratton & Kurucz (1997a,b, hereinafter\nC97a,b). The theoretical grid (constant T e f f and log g) in the\n[m1 ], [c1 ] plane is shown in Fig. 1. This figure suggests that for\n0.50 \u2264 log g \u2264 3.50 and 5000K \u2264 T e f f \u2264 7000K there is a oneto-one correspondence between a point in the [m1 ], [c1 ] plane\nand the corresponding T e f f and log g values. Thus, in principle,\nin this color range it is possible to invert Eqs. (6) and, in turn,\nto derive an expression for Eq.(8).\nBefore proceeding, it is important to verify if the location\nof theoretical grids in the [m1 ], [c1 ] plane is consistent with the\none occupied by real Cepheid data. To this aim, we have overplotted on Fig. 1 the color-color [m1 ], [c1 ] loop for all the stars\nin our sample (see section 5.1). Figure 2 shows the resulting\ncomparison for three stars (FF Aql, FN Aql, U Aql) of our\nsample, characterized by short and intermediate periods. The\nfigure shows that the color-color loops for the selected stars\nare completely included in the theoretical grids. The same test\nhas been performed for the three stars W Sgr, WZ Sgr, SV Vul,\nwhich have longer periods. As showed by Fig. 3, in this case the\n\nFig. 3. The same as in Fig. 2 but for three Cepheids with period\nlonger than 15 d.\n\ncolor-color loops for the selected Cepheids lies outside (at low\ngravity and low effective temperature) of the region covered by\ntheoretical grids. This unexpected result has to be taken into\naccount when applying our method to such long period stars.\nAn explanation for this model limitation is beyond the scopes\nof present paper but it is an important issues worth to be addressed in a future work.\n\n\f4\n\nA.

Derivation of S V\n\nIn the following we describe in detail how the models have\nbeen used to test the method.\n\nFig. 4. log T e f f as a function of [m1 ], [c1 ] obtained by a 4th\ndegree polynomial fit of theoretical data (crosses) by C97a,b.\n\nAs shown in the previous section, the first step in the construction of a new, based on Str\u00f6mgren photometry, version\nof the CORS method, is the formulation of S V in the form\nof Eq.(8). To this aim, we have first to find relations in the\nform of Eqs.(7) starting from theoretical grids. This has been\nachieved by means of a 4th degree polynomial fit to the\ntheoretical grid (least square fit). The results of the polynomial\napproximations are reported in Appendix A, and showed in\nFigs. 4 and 5 for log T e f f and log ge f f respectively. The rms of\nthe fits are:0.0018 dex for log T e f f and 0.1 for log ge f f .\nOn the basis of the calculated relations we are now in the\nposition to estimate the surface brightness from the expression:\nS V = const. \u2212 10 log T e f f \u2212 BC(T e f f , ge f f )\n\n(11)\n\nwhere BC is the Bolometric Correction, derived as a function\nof effective temperature and gravity (BC = BC(T e f f , ge f f )).\nThis function can be easily obtained using again a 4th degree\npolynomial fit to the theoretical grids. The resulting equation is\nalso reported in Appendix A and shown in Fig.6. Note that the\nrms is only 0.003 mag.\nThe procedure outlined above allowed us to achieve\nour goal, i.e. to derive an analytic, although approximated,\nexpression of S V = S V ([m1 ], [c1 ]), and, in turn, to calculate\nthe \u2206B term, which allows us to apply the CORS method,\nin its more general formulation, for data in the Str\u00f6mgren\nphotometric system.\n\nFig. 6. BC as a function of log T e , log g obtained by a 4th degree\npolynomial fit of theoretical data (crosses) by C97a,b.\n\n4. Test of the revised CORS method\nTo verify the accuracy of the new approximation, we have\napplied the CORS method (with the new S V calibration) to\nsynthetic light, color and radial velocity curves predicted by\nCepheid full amplitude, nonlinear, convective models. The advantages of testing the method by means of pulsation model\ncurves, rather than empirical data, are the following:\n1. for pulsation models, bolometric light curves are transformed into the observational bands using the same model\natmosphere tabulations (C97a,b) we have used to derive the\nsurface brightness calibration;\n\n4.1. The synthetic curves\nTo test both the accuracy and the consistency of the new CORS\nmethod we have adopted the pulsation observables predicted\nby hydrodynamical models of classical Cepheids. A detailed\ndiscussion on the physical assumptions adopted to calculate\nthese models can be found in Bono, Marconi & Stellingwerf\n(1999, BMS99) and Bono, Castellani, Marconi (2002). Among\nthe different sequences of nonlinear models computed by\nBMS99 we have selected canonical models2 at solar chemical\ncomposition (Y = 0.28, Y = 0.02) and stellar masses ranging\nfrom 5 to 9 M\u2299 . At fixed stellar mass, we generally chose\nthree models which are located in the middle of the instability\nstrip as well as close to the blue and the red edge. The period\nof selected models roughly ranges from 3.5 to 62 days. The\ninput parameters (M, T e f f , L), the computed radius and the\npulsational period are summarized in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

Application to theoretical models\nAs a first test, we have applied the method to \"perfect\" light,\ncolor and radial velocity curves, i.e. the curves directly obtained from the models which, of course, do not show random\nerrors. This test allows us to verify whether or not our calibration of the surface brightness is intrinsically correct. If this is\nthe case we do not expect a large discrepancy between the calculated radii and the \"true\" (theoretical) ones.\nTo perform this comparison we have evaluated the radius of\neach model in the two different approximations:\n\u2013 Without the \u2206B term (Baade-Wesselink approximation);\n\u2013 With the \u2206B estimated as described in section 3.\nThe results of this test are summarized in the first four\ncolumns of Table 2. We note that, the application to models\nwith long period is justified by the fact that the bolometric light\ncurves of pulsation models have been transformed into the observational bands by using the same model atmospheres by\nC97a,b. Therefore, at variance with the observed long period\nCepheids, the model color-color loops are always consistent\nwith C97a,b's grids.\nThe same result is also shown in Fig. 8, which suggests\nthat our calibration of the surface brightness is intrinsically\ncorrect with the discrepancy between \"computed\" and \"theoretical\" Cepheid radii being around 1 %. We also note that the\ninclusion of the \u2206B term only slightly improves the agreement\nwith predicted radii, producing a small reduction of the scatter\naround the mean (see labelled values in Fig. 8).\n\n4.3. Stability tests\nOnce verified that the new calibration of the surface brightness\nis intrinsically correct, we are in the position to estimate the statistical error in the radius determination due to uncertainties in\nthe measurements, i.e. to test the sensitivity of our technique to\nthe accuracy of observed light, color and radial velocity curves.\nTo this aim, we have transformed the synthetic curves for models in Table 1 by adopting the following steps:\n\nFig. 8. Ratio between \"computed\" and \"theoretical\" radii as\na function of the logarithmic period. The bottom panel displays the radius evaluation based on the revised CORS method,\nwhile the top one the radius evaluations based on the pure BW\nmethod.\n\n1. we have reduced the number of phase points to the typical\nvalue for observations, i.e. \u223c 30 \u2212 35;\n2. we have extracted phases randomly;\n3. we have added Gaussian errors, considering the cases:\na) good data (\u03c3V = 0.02mag, \u03c3[m1 ] = 0.04mag, \u03c3[c1 ] =\n0.04mag, \u03c3RV = 0.25km\u22121 , number of phase points=35);\nb) fair data (\u03c3V = 0.04mag, \u03c3[m1 ] = 0.08mag, \u03c3[c1 ] =\n0.08mag, \u03c3RV = 0.5km\u22121 , number of points=30).\nAs an example, Fig. 9 shows the synthetic light, color and\nradial velocity curves obtained for model mod4 (see Table 1).\nLeft panels show the pure model curves, whereas middle and\n\n\f6\n\nA.

The left panels show the pure model curves; the middle and right ones the\nmodified curves in the case of good and fair data respectively.\n\nFig. 10. Ratio between \"computed\" and \"theoretical\" radii as\na function of the logarithmic period. In the left panels (a) the\nradius is computed using modified curves that simulate good\nquality, adopting either the revised CORS method (bottom) or\nthe pure BW one (top). In the right panels (b) similar plots are\nshown for radii computed from modified curves that simulate\nfair quality data.\nright panels show the modified curves in the two cases a) and\nb) respectively.\nWe then applied the new CORS method to the whole set of\nmodified synthetic curves. The resulting radii are reported in\nthe last two columns of Table 2, whereas in Fig. 10 we plot the\n\nratio between \"computed\" and \"theoretical\" radii as a function\nof the logarithmic period. In particular, top and bottom panels show the CORS solutions without and with \u2206B respectively\nfor the cases a) (left) and b) (right). Figure 10 seems to show\nthat including the \u2206B term does not improve much the results,\non the contrary, the scatter in case a) worsen. However, this\ndisagreeable occurrence is only apparent. In fact, by excluding \"mod8\" and \"mod10\" that show a very peculiar morphology (a sharp bump) of the [c1 ] color curve (see figure Fig.7 for\n\"mod10\"), which makes difficult the fit and the \u2206B calculation,\nthe average uncertainties on the radius estimation fall to 3.5%\nand 5% in cases a) and b) respectively (including the \u2206B term).\nThese numbers represent a useful lower limit for the error associated with radius determination obtained by the CORS version\ndeveloped in this paper.\nAnother possible source of uncertainty in the radius determination is the misalignment between light or color curves, and\nthe radial velocity one. In fact, the photometric and radial velocity data are rarely collected simultaneously. This occurrence\ncould introduce a shift in phase \u2206\u03c6 between the two different\ndata set. To verify the importance of this shift on the radius determination we have introduced an artificial phase shift (starting steps of \u2206\u03c6 = 0.01 up to \u2206\u03c6 = 0.1) in the synthetic radial\nvelocity curves with respect to the photometric ones.\nThe result of such a test is shown in Fig. 11, where the ratio between \"computed\" and \"theoretical\" radii is plotted as a\nfunction of the phase shift \u2206\u03c6 for the model mod2. The \"computed\" radius is larger than the \"theoretical\" one for 0 < \u2206\u03c6 \u2264\n0.1, whereas it becomes smaller beyond 0.1 with the effect increasing with the phase shift. Eventually, our program does not\nconverge for \u2206\u03c6 \u2265 0.3. However, such large phase shifts are\nnever reached when we deal with actual data. In fact, when the\ntemporal distance between photometric and radial velocity data\nis rather long (\u223c 1000 cycles ), for a typical Cepheid with period P \u223c 10 \u00b1 5 * 10\u22125 d, the resulting phase shift is \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0.05.\nAs shown in Fig. 11, this value of \u2206\u03c6 is sufficient to generate\na systematic error on the derived radius of about 17%. This occurrence confirms quantitatively the need to use photometric\n\n\fA. Ruoppo et al.: Improvement of the CORS method for Cepheids radii determination based on Str\u00f6mgren photometry\n\nand radial velocity data as close as possible in time, or otherwise to correct this shift.\n\n5. Application of the method\nHaving tested the capabilities of the new version of the CORS\nmethod (see previous section), we are ready to apply it to actual\ndata. In the following we discuss the application to a sample of\n52 Galactic Cepheids.\n\n7\n\n\u2013 Stars TU Cas, V367 Sct and BQ Ser are double mode\nCepheids (Pardo & Poretti, 1997 and references therein).\n\u2013 Stars U Aql, FF Aql, V 496 Aql, \u03b7 Aql, RX Aur, SU Cas,\n\u03b4 Cep, GI Car, SU Cyg, VZ Cyg, \u03b6 Gem, X Lac, Y Lac, Z\nLac, BG Lac, T Mon, Y Oph, BF Oph, AW Per, Y Sct,\nS Sge, W Sgr, Y Sgr, WZ Sgr, AP Sgr, V 350 Sgr, SZ\nTau, T Vul, U Vul and SV Vul are members of binary systems. Note that this list is the result of a detailed analysis of Szabados's selection. (Szabados, 2003 and references\ntherein).\n\n5.1. The sample\nWe searched the literature for an homogeneous sample of\nGalactic Cepheids with photometric data in the Str\u00f6mgren system and we selected the 31 pulsators analysed by Arellano\nFerro et al. (1998) (AFGR hereafter) supplemented by data for\nother 21 objects from the papers by Feltz & McNamara (1980)\n(FM hereafter) and Eggen (1985, 1996) (Eg hereafter).\nConcerning radial velocity data, several large and homogeneous datasets are available in the literature. In particular,\nwe have used the catalogues from: Evans (1980) (E hereafter),\nGieren (1981) (G hereafter), Barnes et al. (1987, 1988), (BMS\nhereafter), Coulson et al. (1985) (CCG hereafter), Wilson et\nal. (1989) (WCB hereafter), Metzger et al. (1993) (MCMS\nhereafter), Bersier et al. (1994) (BBMD hereafter), Gorynya et\nal. (1998) (GSSRGA hereafter), Kiss (1998) (K hereafter) and\nImbert (1999) (I hereafter).\nIn general we considered only Cepheids with good photometric and radial velocity curves, i.e. more than 15 phase\npoints and reasonable precision. When measurements by different authors are available for the same stars we have chosen\ndata which have: 1) the largest phase points number and the\nbest precision; 2) the lowest temporal separation with respect\nto the photometric data. When we have distant data sets, that\nis differences between radial velocity and photometric curves\nlarger than \u223c 1000 cycles, (6 stars, see Table 3) we correct\nthe misalignment between this two curves by using different\nepochs.\nIn few cases we have merged data from different authors, in\norder to obtain more sampled radial velocity curves (see Table\n3). Our final selected dataset is summarized in Table 3.\n\n5.2. Peculiar stars\nSome Cepheids in our sample need to be discussed individually:\n\u2013 For the stars TT Aql, X Cyg, T Mon, RU Sct, Y Sct, WZ Sgr\nand SV Vul, we can calculate the radius only in the classical Baade-Wesselink approximation (without the \u2206B term),\nbecause for these stars the loop in the [m1 ], [c1 ] plane does\nnot lie completely within the theoretical grids by C97a,b\n(see paragraph 3.1);\n\u2013 We have excluded from our sample the Cepheids GI Car,\nSU Cas, Y Lac, SZ Tau, X Vul for the poor data quality.\n\u2013 Stars DT Cyg, FF Aql, BG Cru and V440 Per are first overtone pulsators (Antonello, Poretti & Reduzzi, 1990).\n\n5.3. Comparison with the literature\nIn table 4 we report the radius obtained for all the Cepheids in\nour sample, and, for comparison purposes, we report the literature results renormalized to our projection factor k. In particular, from left to right we report for each Cepheid: the name;\nthe period; the CORS radii obtained without and with the \u2206B\nterm (Rwithout\u2206B and R\u2206B ); the radii obtained by Arellano Ferro\n& Rosenzweing (2000) RAFR , Laney & Stobie (1995) RLS or\nGieren et al. (1998) RGFG , Ripepi et al. (1997) RRBMR. and\nMoffett & Barnes (1987) RBM .\nIn Fig. 12 we have compared our results with those of authors\nreported in the table 4. As a result we find that our radii are\non average larger than the radii obtained by Arellano Ferro &\nRosenzweing (2000) and Moffett & Barnes (1987), while they\nare slightly smaller than Ripepi et al. (1997) ones (see labels\nin Fig. 12). The scatter in this comparisons is rather large (\u223c\n30%); this occurrence could be due to: 1) the inclusion of binary stars in the comparison (different methods uses different\ncolours and then binarity could affect differentially the various\ndeterminations); 2) the use of optical colors. Verifying hypothesis 1) by comparing only the non-binary stars does not make\nsense because of the small number of \"bona fide\" single stars\nin our sample.\nConcerning point 2), as well known in the literature (Laney\n& Stobie 1995, Gieren, Foqu\u00e9 & G\u00f3mez 1997), radii obtained\nfrom NIR data are more precise than the ones obtained by using\noptical colors. Unfortunately, most works with radii determinations from NIR data deal with southern Cepheids and we have\nvery few stars in common (see column 7 of Table 4 for the\ncomparison)\nRecently it has become possible to derive accurate stellar\nradii from the angular diameters measured with interferometric\ntechniques (see Nordgren et al. 2000 and Lane et al. 2002) combined with Hypparcos parallaxes. The comparison with these\nmeasurements represents a useful test for our results. In Table\n5 we compare with our results the radii obtained by Nordgren\nal. (2000) and Lane et al. (2002), with the quoted interferometric techniques, for the stars in common with our sample,\nnamely \u03b7 Aql, \u03b4 Cep and \u03b6 Gem. In particular, from left to\nright, we report: the name of the star; the radius (RI ) obtained\nby means of interferometric techniques (\u03b4 Cep from Nordgren\net al. 2000 and \u03b7Aql and \u03b6 Gem from Lane et al. 2002); our\nradius in the two different approximations, without (Rwithout\u2206B )\nand with (Rwith\u2206B ) the \u2206B term respectively. The interferometric radii, reported in Table 5, are corrected for the different k\n\n\f8\n\nA.

The Period-Radius relation\nAfter having tested the method and the consistency of our results with previous determinations in the literature, we are in\nthe position to derive a PR relation based on the new derived\nradii.\nThe PR relations for all the stars in our sample for which the\nprogram reached the convergence are shown in Fig. 13, where\nthe the top and bottom panels illustrate the case without and\nwith \u2206B respectively. A least square fit to the data (solid lines\nin Fig. 13) leads to the following Period-Radius relations in\nthe case without the \u2206B term (Eq. 12) and with the \u2206B term\n(Eq. 13):\nlog R = (1.18 \u00b1 0.05) + (0.67 \u00b1 0.06) log P r.m.s = 0.09 (12)\nlog R = (1.22 \u00b1 0.06) + (0.67 \u00b1 0.08) log P r.m.s = 0.08 (13)\nAn inspection of the figure suggests that the presence of\nfirst overtone pulsators (filled triangles) could affect the derived\nPR relations because, at fixed period, they are brighter and, in\nturn, have larger radii than fundamental pulsators.\nSimilarly, also Cepheids belonging to binary systems could\n\n103\n530\n142\n-\n\n\fA.

We therefore calculated new\nPeriod-Radius relations with the following results (see Fig. 14):\nlog R = (1.18 \u00b1 0.08) + (0.69 \u00b1 0.09) log P r.m.s = 0.08 (14)\nlog R = (1.19 \u00b1 0.09) + (0.74 \u00b1 0.11) log P r.m.s = 0.07 (15)\nA comparison between Eq. 12, 13 and Eq. 14, 15 shows\nthat the net result of our selection criterion mainly consist in\nincreasing the slope of the PR relation, going in the direction\nto improve the agreement with the literature, and, in particular\nwith the NIR results by Laney & Stobie (1995) and Gieren et\nal. (1998) (see table 6 for a comparison between present results\nand other relations in the literature). Yet, we have to note that\nthe errors of the derived coefficients are rather large. This is\ncaused by: 1) the small number of Cepheids left after the selection process (In particular the number of binary stars in our\nsample is very large) 2) the lack of long period Cepheids in\nthe case with \u2206B, as a result of problems with synthetic model\natmosphere grids (see Sect. 3.1). We remark, however, that including or not the \u2206B term in the CORS determination makes\nsome difference, in the sense that, apart from a few Cepheids\nin the low period range, the scatter in the PR relation is slightly\nreduced (see Fig. 14) when the \u2206B term is included. This result\nseems to suggest that the modification to the CORS method\npresented in this paper is well suited also when applied to real\nstars (not merely to synthetic light curves).\nFinally, we notice that our results concerning the radii and\nthe PR relations could be, in principle, combined with an effective temperature calibration to derive the intrinsic stellar luminosity, through the Stefan-Boltzmann law, and in turn distance to studied Cepheids. This possibility will be investigated\n\nin a forthcoming paper. In the following section we will apply\nan alternative method to derive the luminosity and distance by\nmeans of the comparison of empirical light and radial velocity\n\nFig. 14.

Theoretical Fit of the light and radial velocity\ncurves of the Cepheid Y Oph\nBefore going to the conclusions of this paper, we note that it\nhas recently been suggested that nonlinear pulsation models\nprovide a direct tool to evaluate the intrinsic stellar properties\nof pulsating stars through the comparison of observed and\npredicted variations of relevant parameters along a pulsation\ncycle (see Wood, Arnold & Sebo 1997, Bono, Castellani &\nMarconi 2000, 2002). This kind of analysis also provides\nan additional test for our radius determination technique by\nmeans of the comparison with the radius of the model which\nis able to simultaneously reproduce the period, the amplitude\nand the morphology of light and radial velocity curves. We\nplan to apply this method to a sample of Galactic Cepheids\nwith accurate photometric data and available radial velocity\ninformation. In this paper we present a first application to\nthe Cepheid Y Oph.

The best fit model resulting from\nthese computations is shown in Fig. 15 (solid line). The corre-\n\nFig. 15.

Final remarks\nWe have presented a modified version of the CORS method\nbased on a new calibration of the Surface Brightness function\nin the Str\u00f6mgren photometric system. In particular we have\nbeen able to derive a calibration of S V as a function of the\nStr\u00f6mgren reddening free indexes [m1 ] and [c1 ] by adopt-\n\n\f12\n\nA. Ruoppo et al.: Improvement of the CORS method for Cepheids radii determination based on Str\u00f6mgren photometry\n\ning grids of theoretical colors. This procedure revealed the\nunexpected occurrence that the quoted theoretical grids are\nnot able to fully include the location of actual long period\n(P \u2265 12-13 days) Cepheids loops in the [m1 ],[c1 ] plane. This\nproblem could only be overcome by adopting next generation,\nhopefully improved, model atmosphere grids. Nevertheless,\nthe modified CORS method presented here has been tested\nby means of synthetic light and radial velocity curves derived\nfrom nonlinear pulsation models and simulations have been\nperformed to take into account the quality of real observed\ncurves as well as possible time shifts between photometric\nand radial velocity data. The results of such tests can be\nsummarized as follows:\na) the present method appears capable to derive the radius of a\nCepheids with an average precision of around 3.5% and 5% in\nthe case of good and fair observational data respectively (see\nSection 4.3);\nb) the error associated with a phase shift between photometric\nand radial velocity data could be as large as \u223c 17% in the\nextreme case of \u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0.05. In a more common case of\n\u2206\u03c6 \u223c 0.01 the relative error is still rather large, namely \u223c 5%.\nIf we add to the error budget the uncertainty on the value of\nthe projection factor k (\u223c \u00b1 2% for \u2206k \u00b1 0.03), neglecting\nother possible contributions (see Bono, Caputo & Stellingwerf\n1994 and references therein for a detailed discussion), we\ncan conclude that estimating the radius of a Cepheid by\nmeans of the Baade-Wesselink method (at least in the present\nformulation) with an accuracy better than 10% is extremely\ndifficult to be achieved.\nThe method has been then applied to a sample of Galactic\nCepheids with Str\u00f6mgren photometry and radial velocity data\nto derive the radii and a new PR relation. As a result we obtained the following Period-Radius relation: log R = (1.19 \u00b1\n0.09) + (0.74 \u00b1 0.11) log P (r.m.s=0.07). This relation, even if\nnot very accurate (mainly due to the unexpected presence of a\nlarge fraction of binary stars in our Cepheid sample), nevertheless is in satisfactory agreement with previous findings in the\nliterature.\nAcknowledgements.
