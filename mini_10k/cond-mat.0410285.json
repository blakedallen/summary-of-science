Although a lot of\nsimplified theoretical models to describe the physical properties of real materials work on a meso- or macroscopic level with coarse-grained variables, these\nmodels often exhibit badly defined materials parameters which stem from the\ntrue many-body problem. Thus, a microscopic ab-inito theory to model real\nmaterials systems is not only appreciated to shed light on the definition of\nsuch parameters, but also to provide a valuable tool to identify the important\ninteractions and physical processes on an atomistic level that determine the\nmacroscopic behavior. In recent years it became possible by the invention of\neffective approximations and the overwhelming increase of computer power to\nget a grip on the highly demanding calculational schemes of such microscopic\nmodellings from first principles [1].\nThe ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) in the local-spin-density approxmiation (LSDA) and in the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) is\nnowadays a widely accepted highly efficient method to describe the electronic\nstructure of weakly correlated materials. In DFT the electronic many-particle\nproblem in the ground state is exactly mapped on an effective single-particle\nformalism, whereby the many-electron wavefunction is replaced by the electronic charge density n(r) as the characterising quantity of the system [2,3].\nIn actual calculations only a small part of the total energy of the system, the\nexchange-correlation energy Exc [n], has to be approximated.\nDue to the fact that in order to reveal the energetics of a given material\nsystem for arbitrary concentrations of the involved components a sole DFT\ndescription is still too costly, a suitable coarse-graining of the method has to\nbe accomplished. This can be achieved in a well-defined way by the cluster\nexpansion (CE) [4]. By this method, any function of the configuration on a\ngiven parent lattice can be expanded into cluster functions, whereby a cluster\non the lattice is uniquely defined by the lattice points that are included in\nsuch a geometrical object. The CE coefficients are configuration independent.\nThrough the structure inversion method (SIM) [5], a direct link between the\nCE and the ab-initio electron theory can be established by fitting the coefficients of the CE (terminated at a maximum cluster) to the ab-inito calculated\ndata for the physical property which is to be cluster expanded. Because of the\ndecoupling of expansion coefficients and occupations on the parent lattice, a\nCE established in such a way can be highly efficient in obtaining values for\nthe physical quantity in question for arbitrary lattice configurations and arbitrary concentrations of the components. By construction, these new values\nshould in principle have the same accuracy as those explicitly computed via\n2\n\n\fthe underlying electronic structure method.\nFor the ab-initio description of finite temperature properties a modelling of\nthe free energy of the material system has to be achieved. This can be done\nby including entropy in the cluster theory in the form of the cluster variation method (CVM) [6,7,4,8]. In the CVM one can write down a functional\nfor the free energy where the internal energy is expressed by a CE with the\ncluster functions replaced by cluster correlation functions. The configurational\nentropy is also easily represented by the latter [4]. By minimizing the free energy functional with respect to the cluster correlation functions (or the cluster\noccupation probabilities which can also serve as natural variables in this problem) a meaningful approximation to the true free energy of the system can\nbe obtained. The approximation is of course given by the limited number of\nclusters one can consider in the practical cluster theory. In the limit of the\ninclusion of all possible clusters, the CE and the CVM become mathematically\nexact on a given parent lattice.\n\n1.2 The Ni-Fe-Al system\n\nThe present first-principles investigation was carried out for the ternary intermetallic system Ni-Fe-Al. Most of this type of modelling was done in the past\nfor binary systems, only few such ab-initio assessments can be found in literature for ternary or even higher multicomponent materials systems. This is\nin contrast to the technological development of new materials, where in most\ncases more than two components are necessary to attain desired materials\nproperties. As an example for this serve alloys which are based on Ti, Fe and\nNi aluminides [9]. Structural alloys derived from these intermetallic phases are\npromising candidates for high performance materials, because they show high\nstrength at all temperatures, low density and high chemical resistance. The\nmain drawback of these aluminides is their brittleness, in particular at low\ntemperatures. To overcome this drawback and also to further improve the advantageous materials properties, either substitution of atoms by impurities or\naddition of other phases to the given one have to be considered. For instance,\nsmall additions of Boron to Ni3 Al have a ductilization effect [10]. Concerning\nNiAl, it was found that minor amounts of Fe additions also enhance the ductility [11]. Furthermore, as shown by Letzig et al. [12] the complete Ni-Fe-Al\nsystem offers various alloying possibilities for softening NiAl and Ni3 Al, too.\nBut a theoretical investigation of this ternary system may be motivated not\nonly from a purely technological point of view. Besides the general need for\nconsolidation of the first-principles alloy theory for multicomponent systems,\ni.e., higher than binary, the Ni-Fe-Al system exhibits also rich physics from\na very fundamental point of view. The system incorporates two transition\nmetals, Ni and Fe, with partially filled 3d states which can give rise to localized electronic behavior, and the simple metal Al with itinerant s and p states.\n3\n\n\fMoreover, Ni and Fe are ferromagnetic in their elemental crystal ground state,\nwhereby the structure differs, i.e., Ni crystallizes on a fcc and Fe on a bcc lattice. Nonmagnetic Al is again stable in a fcc structure, but with a much larger\nlattice constant compared to fcc-Ni, since the atomic radius of Al is 15%\nbigger than the atomic radius of Ni (Ni and Fe atoms have nearly identical\natomic radii in the solid state). Therefore, depending on the concentration\nof the three constituents, a strongly varying behavior in the electronic structure, magnetism and the alloy structure is expected. Already well studied are\nthe binary subsystems, i.e., Ni-Fe, Ni-Al and Fe-Al (see [13,14,15] and references therein). The Ni-Fe system, with the famous Invar region [16] around\nNi35 Fe65 , shows a very strong influence of magnetism on the phase stability.\nIn contrast, in Ni-Al this influence is nearly negligible. Lying between these\nlimiting cases, Fe-Al shows a very delicate interplay between structure and\nmagnetism [15,17,18,19]. In addition, the Al-rich aluminide systems exhibit\nlow ordering energies that give rise to stable crystal structures with low symmetries, whereas for the transition-metal-rich regions only structures on the\nbcc and fcc lattice are stable.\nOnly very few theoretical approaches to model Ni-Fe-Al are known from literature (e.g., [20,21]). Especially, there exists no complete theoretical description\nfor the global system, also not with empirical parameters. There are experimental investigations (for instance, [22,23] and references therein), but the\noverall understanding of this system, in particular on an atomistic level, is\nrather scarce. Hence the present work is dedicated to provide an introduction to an ab-initio modelling of Ni-Fe-Al by revealing some insight in the\ninteresting physics of this system.\n\n2\n\nCalculational procedure\n\n2.1 DFT calculations\nTo elucidate the ground state properties of Ni-Fe-Al, as a first step DFT calculations with our ab-initio mixed-basis pseudopotential (MBPP) code [24] were\nperformed for chosen reference solid compounds. In the MBPP code, normconserving pseudopotentials are used and the basis consists of plane waves\nand a few additional localized functions per atom. For Exc we used the GGA\ngiven by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) [25]. In the whole modelling\nonly structures on the bcc and fcc lattice were taken into account (with a\nsmall exception for Al-rich Ni-Al at T =0, cf. section 3.1.2), thereby restricting the Ni-Fe-Al system onto these cubic parent lattices. As other lattice types\nbecome important only in the technologically less interesting Al-rich region of\nthe ternary phase diagram [22,23], this restriction cuts off only a small part of\ncommon general interest. To investigate the influence of collinear magnetism\n4\n\n\fwe performed both spin-unpolarized and spin-polarized calculations for each\nconsidered crystal structure.\nIn the MBPP calculations, the numbers of k-points in the irreducible wedge\nof the 1. Brillouin zone where 408, 440 and 280 for fcc-Ni, bcc-Fe and fcc-Al,\nrespectively, in order to ensure an equivalent k-point grid for the different\nstructures. With the same intention, the k-point grid for all the treated compounds was chosen in such a way that the density of sampled k-points was the\nsame for each structure. The cut-off energy for the plane waves was generally\nset to 24 Ryd, and throughout the calculations a Gaussian smearing of 0.05 eV\nwas employed. With this choice for the convergence parameters the relevant\nformation energy Ef , defined for a given structure \u03c3 as\n(fm)\n(fm)\n(nm)\nEf (\u03c3) = Etot (\u03c3) \u2212 cNi Etot\n(fcc-Ni) \u2212 cFe Etot\n(bcc-Fe) \u2212 cAl Etot\n(fcc-Al), (1)\n\nwith the concentration ci of the species and the total energy Etot , whereby the\nsuperscripts 'nm'/'fm' indicate the nonmagnetic/ferromagnetic state, can be\nconverged to 0.05 meV/atom.\n2.2 Cluster expansions\nFrom the calculated formation energies and magnetic moments, a set of CEs\nwas constructed via the SIM. In practise, a CE for the function f of the\nconfiguration \u03c3 in an M component system on a given parent lattice can\ngenerally be written as [4]\nf (\u03c3) = f0 +\n\n\u03b3,M\nX\u22121\n\nf\u03b1m \u03c6\u03b1m (\u03c3 \u03b1 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b1,m\n\nwhere \u03c6\u03b1m is the cluster function for cluster \u03b1 and degree m, f\u03b1m is the cluster\nexpansion coefficient and \u03b3 is a maximum cluster. The quantity f0 designates\nthe empty cluster. The cluster function is suitably chosen to be a function of\nspin variables \u03c3. For the considered ternary case values of 1, -1 and 0 where\nattributed to these occupation variables assigned to Ni, Fe and Al. As the\ncomplete ternary basis for the cluster functions \u03c6\u03b1m , we used \u03981 ={1, \u03c3, \u03c3 2 },\nand for comparison also the orthonormal Chebychev basis [4,26], below named\n\u03982 . The clusters \u03b1 belong to a chosen set with a maximum cluster \u03b3, where \u03b1\ndoes not necessarily have to be a subcluster of \u03b3. The expansion coefficient f\u03b1m\nwill be named K\u03b1m in the case of the formation energy. Note that generally\nany CE coefficient can be understood as an effective cluster interaction (ECI)\nwhich includes contributions from physical interactions within and outside the\ncluster range [27].\nIn our work, CEs for the bcc and fcc lattice were constructed. Two cluster sets\nwere used. First, we extracted for both parent lattices a traditional tetrahedron\nCE (T-CE) (see [28] and references therein) from the ab-initio calculated data\n5\n\n\ffor the physical quantities in question, i.e., formation energy and magnetic\nmoment, of selected reference configurations. In this T-CE, all used clusters\nare subclusters of the minimum tetrahedron on the given lattice. On the bcc\nlattice this includes 5 clusters, namely the point, the nearest-neighbor (NN)\npair, the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) pair, the triangle with two NN pairs\nand one NNN pair and the irregular tetrahedron itself with two NN pairs and\ntwo NNN pairs. For the fcc lattice the T-CE corresponds to 4 clusters, i.e.,\nthe point, the NN pair, the triangle with three NN pairs and the regular tetrahedron with four NN pairs. Hence, whereas the bcc T-CE incorporates NNN\ncorrelations, the fcc T-CE includes only NN correlations. Due to the completeness requirement, there are 21 cluster functions on the bcc lattice and 15\non the fcc lattice in the ternary case for the tetrahedron approximation. The\nsame numbers of ECIs were determined by the SIM via matrix inversion, i.e.,\nthe number of reference structures was equivalent to the number of ECIs.\nAs we were mainly interested in the ternary B2 phase of the Ni-Fe-Al system,\nwe developed in addition a higher CE for the bcc lattice with 13 clusters,\nincluding the point, pairs up to the 6th NN, four triplets, the irregular tetrahedron and a pentahedron (s. Fig. 1). It follows that there are 65 different\ncluster functions, and associated therewith, of course, the same number of\nECIs, for the ternary system. In that case the SIM was performed via a leastmean-squares fit of 127 ab-initio calculated formation energies and magnetic\nmoments, out of which 75 belonged to binary and 49 to ternary compounds.\nWe will name this CE, according to the maximum body cluster, 'pentahedron\nCE (P-CE)' but note that in contrast to the T-CE, this does not mean that\nall and only the subclusters of this pentahedron are included.\nWith these cluster sets, the formation energy and the magnetic moment were\nexpanded in different schemes. First, the spin-unpolarized and spin-polarized\nformation energy were expanded for both parent lattice types with allowing\nonly for global volume relaxations but no structural relaxations of the reference\nstructures, in order to reveal the influence of magnetism in the fixed geometries. Thereby, as an approximation we allowed only for ferromagnetic (fm)\nalignment of the local moments which possibly develop in the spin-polarized\nMBPP calculations. This can be validated by the experimental observation\nthat all stable cubic ordered compounds in the Ni-Fe-Al system are ferromagnetic in their respective ground state when showing magnetic behavior. The\nonly critical case is stoichiometric FeAl, where DFT in LSDA/GGA predicts\na ferromagnetic ground state [17], whereas experimentally no net magnetic\nmoment at very low temperatures is detected [29]. Throughout the rest of the\npaper the nomenclature Ef(fm) will be used for the cluster-expanded formation\nenergies of structures with potentially ferromagnetic order, i.e., the magnetic\nenergy is implicitly included in that CE.\nAdditionally, we checked for the influence of \"local structural relaxations\" on\nthe bcc lattice by cluster-expanding also the spin-polarized formation energy\nfor the structurally relaxed reference structures. During a \"local structural\nrelaxation\" all atoms are relaxed but the unit cell is kept cubic, i.e., no shape\n6\n\n\frelaxation of the supercell is performed. For instance, among the various considered configurations in the supercell there are such which would lead to a\ntetragonal distortion of the supercell if we allowed for a c/a relaxation. To\nkeep the cubic shape of the supercell during structural relaxation seems to be\nmeaningful for a modelling with multiple parent lattices, as employed here.\nWithin a \"full structural relaxation\" including shape relaxation, the connection between the reference structure and its supposed parent lattice may get\nlost more easily. An example is the case of tetragonal L10 -NiAl on the fcc\nparent lattice, which transforms into B2-NiAl on the bcc parent lattice when\nrelaxing c/a [30]. The described way of including the structural relaxations\nwas performed only in the more sophisticated pentahedron approximation.\nThroughout the rest of the paper, the resulting CE is correspondingly named\nrP-CE.\nThe mean error in meV/atom for the ECIs from the least-mean-squares fitted\nSIM was 13.4, 11.1 and 12.0 for the spin-unpolarized P-CE, the spin-polarized\nP-CE and the rP-CE (spin-polarized) in the \u03981 basis, respectively. Hence,\nthe latter CEs should be well enough converged to account for a meaningful\ndescription of the energetics in the given approximations.\nIn order to investigate the relevant energy landscape of Ni-Fe-Al by the constructed ternary CEs, we developed a simple algorithm to determine homogeneous lowest-energy structures for each given ternary composition. In this\nalgorithm, a random starting configuration is successively modified by site exchange of, respectively, two atoms in a periodically continued supercell. After\neach such Monte-Carlo sweep, the energy of the new structure is calculated\nand the structure will be accepted if the energy is lower than the one of the\nold structure. For the supercells, sizes of 54 and 108 atoms were used in the\ncalculations. The minimum formation energy is usually reached in some thousand sweeps and the corresponding optimized homogeneous structure may be\nextracted. Please note that the so obtained homogeneous lowest-energy structures for arbitrary compositions are not necessarily identical to the true ground\nstate structures which are often heterogeneous mixtures of various phases.\n\n2.3 CVM calculations\n\nFor the calculation of the ternary incoherent phase diagram on the bcc and\nfcc lattice at finite temperatures, the CVM in tetrahedron approximation was\nemployed for the internal energy and the configurational entropy. The ab-initio\nfm\nECIs {K\u03b1m\n} obtained from the spin-polarized MBPP calculations were used\nfor the representation of the internal energy. By confining to ferromagnetic order in the MBPP calculations the effect of thermal magnetic excitations on the\nfinite temperature phase diagram is neglected. The actual CVM calculations\nwere performed in a grand canonical ensemble with the set of effective chemical potentials {\u03bc\u0303N i , \u03bc\u0303F e , \u03bc\u0303Al } and the effective grand potential \u03a9(T, V, {\u03bc\u0303i }),\n7\n\n\fwhereby the CVM equations were solved by the Natural Iteration Method\n(NIM) [31]. This whole procedure is described in detail elsewhere [32]. Although vacancies are in principle important defects in phase diagram calculations of intermetallic aluminide systems [33], they were not taken into account\nin this investigation. In a coherent modelling, this would call for a quaternary\ndescription with the vacancy as a fourth component with chemical potential\nzero. Also, vibrational effects on the thermodynamics were neglected.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\n3.1 Zero temperature\n\n3.1.1 General remarks\nIn the Tabs. 1 and 2 the structural data for the structures on the bcc and fcc\nparent lattice used for the development of the respective CEs in tetrahedron\napproximation, i.e., T-CEs, are shown. All structures correspond to a specific\ntetrahedron occupation on the respective parent lattice [28], hence these compounds have a small unit cell and order in NN and NNN neighbor distances.\nThe first line for each compound in Tabs. 1 and 2 corresponds to a spinunpolarized calculation, the second line to a spin-polarized one with possible\nfm order. The lattice constants are generally increased and the bulk moduli\nare decreased by ferromagnetism. The compounds with a '*' are confirmed\nground states in the Ni-Fe-Al system [23]. Thus, none of the highly ordered\nfully ternary structures are stable within the temperature regime investigated\nin experiment. From our MBPP calculations the necessary condition for phase\nstability, i.e., a negative formation energy, is fulfilled by all these structures, at\nleast when taking into account ferromagnetism. However, by checking the possible tie line constructions [34] within the given set of reference structures, we\ncan confirm the experimental observation from the T =0 viewpoint, although\nthe case of NiFeAl2 is delicate (more on this stoichiometry in section 3.1.3).\nThe CE of the possibly ferromagnetic compounds accounts implicitly for the\nmagnetic degrees of freedom. Thereby it is assumed that these degrees of freedom are strongly coupled to the chemical degrees of freedom which are treated\nexplicitly in Eq. (2). Furthermore, as already mentioned, other spin orderings\nwere not allowed, and concerning the energy it was assumed that the energies\nof such possible non-fm configurations can be approximated by the fm energy\ncontribution. Both approximations might be critical in some regions of the\nNi-Fe-Al phase diagram, e.g., the Invar region in Ni-Fe [35], but should be\nreliable for a qualitative inspection of the general trends in the whole system.\nThe ECIs for the CEs of the formation energy in tetrahedron approximation\n8\n\n\fare shown in Tab. 3 for the nonorthogonal \u03981 and the orthonormal \u03982 basis.\nAlthough both sets of ECIs stem from an exact SIM with the same reference structures, the decay of the absolute value of the ECIs is generally more\nclearly visible within the \u03982 basis. However, in practical convergence tests\nvia the prediction of energies of new structures not included in the SIM, no\nappreciable differences between the two basis sets were observed (for a further\ndiscussion on this matter see, e.g., [26]).\nThe discussion of the ECIs in a ternary system is not as straightforward as\nin the binary case, because due to the completeness relation of the CE there\nare now multiple interactions associated with each geometrical cluster. A first\nestimation of the ordering/segregation behavior is, for instance, not easily connected to the sign of the effective pair interactions (EPI) from the common\nCE [26]. Thus, in order to illustrate this behavior it is more appropriate to\nmap the obtained ternary EPIs onto effective quasibinary pair interactions\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\nWN iF e , WN iAl and WF eAl [26], where n denotes the near neighbor distance,\nthat again yield a first information about the ordering/segregation behavior of\nthe system via their sign. Thereby, positive (negative) values describe ordering (segregation) behavior. The values for these quasibinary EPIs, obtained\nfrom a mapping of the ternary EPIs from Tab. 3, are shown in Tab. 4. It is\nseen that the W (n) between the transition-metal atoms and the Al atoms are\n(n)\nalways of an ordering type, in the case of WF eAl subtly influenced by magnetism. In contrast, the NiFe interactions on the bcc lattice remain negative in\nNN distance even when ferromagnetism (very important in the binary Ni-Fe\nsystem, see Tab. 1) is taken into account. Only on the fcc lattice with ferromagnetism there is a indication for weak ordering tendencies. Although the\nNN pair interactions seem to be dominant in Ni-Fe-Al, of course, the effect of\nthe multiplet and also of the higher pair interactions beyond NNN distance is\n1,2\nneglected in the simple set {WAB\n}.\n\n3.1.2 Binary subsystems\nFor the whole composition range, Fig. 2 shows the ferromagnetic formation\nenergy and magnetic moment for homogeneous periodic configurations of the\nbinary subsystems of Ni-Fe-Al at zero temperature. In Fig. 2a the MBPP formation energies for the binary \"canonical\" tetrahedron-representable ordered\nstructures from Tab. 1 and 2 are depicted. Additionally, for Ni-Al the formation energies of the noncubic experimentally stable structures D011 -NiAl3 ,\nD519 -Ni2 Al3 and \"Ga3 Pt5 \"-Ni5 Al3 are also included. The latter structures were\nstructurally relaxed within the MBPP code, whereas the canonical structures\nare cubic structures (apart from the ones with L10 symmetry) for which no\nstructural relaxation degrees of freedom exist. The L10 structures were restricted to the fcc parent lattice (see section 2.2). The ground state structures\naccording to the MBPP calculations are connected with straight lines in Fig.\n2a. For Ni-Fe, L10 -NiFe was also theoretically verified as a stable ground state\n9\n\n\fstructure within the investigated set, although experimentally this is still questionable [13]. In the Ni-Al system the correct ordered ground states according\nto experiment are obtained, except for \"Ga3 Pt5 \"-Ni5 Al3 which we were not\nable to verify as a stable ground state structure (also when including structural\nrelaxations). Problematic seems to be the case for Fe-Al, as in PBE-GGA the\nimportant D03 -Fe3 Al structure was not identified as the stable ground state at\nFe75 Al25 , but L12 -Fe3Al. This seems to be due to the subtle electronic structure in this region of Fe-Al, where simple approximate exchange-correlation\nfunctionals, i.e., LSDA and GGA, might be not appropriate. For a discussion\nof this peculiarity see [18,19].\nThe zero temperature description according to the CEs constructed from the\nreference structures including spin-polarization, shown in Fig. 2b, yields important additional information. The lines in Fig. 2b correspond to the curves\nof lowest formation energy for the homogeneous structures obtained from the\nMetropolis-inspired algorithm described at the end of section 2.2. To obtain\nthese curves, a homogeneous structure optimization for 26 concentrations in\nthe interval [0,1] was performed with this algorithm, and the minimum formation energy was extracted, respectively. First, the formation energy in Fig.\n2b shows for Ni-Fe major energy differences between phases on the bcc and\nthe fcc parent lattice. The energetical crossover lies just around the Invar region. One can also see the important change in the sign of Ef(fm) for structures\non the bcc lattice from positive to negative when applying the pentahedron\nCEs, especially for the Fe-rich system. However, the corresponding phases are\nmetastable because their formation energies lie above the connecting line between the ground state structures bcc-Fe, L10 -NiFe, L12 -Ni3 Fe and fcc-Ni. The\nmagnetic moments of these metastable phases are substantially enhanced, as\nseen by the maximum in the corresponding curves in Fig. 2c. Turning over\nto Ni-Al, the large negative formation energy curves in this system exhibit a\nstrong symmetry with respect to the equiatomic composition. These energies\nshow a similar qualitative compositional dependence on both cubic parent\nlattices, whereby the bcc lattice is favoured around the equiatomic composition. The D011 -NiAl3 phase lies obviously in the bcc/fcc transition region, the\nsame applies for the Ni5 Al3 stoichiometry (see also [36]). Although our calculations do not stabilize \"Ga3 Pt5 \"-Ni5 Al3 , the large relaxation energy around\nthis composition yields a hint for a possible martensitic transition. In general,\nthe magnetic energy does not seem to be essential, although in the Ni-rich\nregion it has some influence which can be relevant for the phase stability [37].\nThe increase of the magnetic moment with increasing Ni content is also clearly\nseen in Fig. 2c. Finally, it is apparent from the figure that the energetical competition between the bcc and fcc parent lattice becomes most delicate for the\ncase of Fe-Al. The formation energy curves for both lattice types are very\nsimilar over a wide composition range. Also, the relaxation energy appears to\nbe crucial in determining the correct phase stability. Especially around the\nequiatomic composition, the differences between the various approximations\nare significant. In contrast to Ni-Al, the magnetic moment persists in the Al10\n\n\frich region of Fe-Al and may have relevant influence on the already sensitive\nenergy landscape. As already stated, the existence of a net magnetic moment\nat equiatomic FeAl is experimentally not verified, but the sensitivity to magnetic degrees of freedom is nevertheless experimentally confirmed [38], also for\nlarger Al content [39].\n\n3.1.3 Ternary system\nTurning now to the multicomponent system, Fig. 3 shows lowest formation\nenergy landscapes for ternary Ni-Fe-Al in the Gibbs triangle representation.\nThese landscapes were computed again via our algorithm to find the minimum formation energy utilizing the respective CEs. Therefore, we introduced\na 2-dimensional mesh of 338(254) grid points for the bcc(fcc) parent lattice\ninside the Gibbs triangle. At each of these grid points we searched for the\nhomogeneous phase with the lowest formation energy within a given periodically continued supercell. Please recall that in this kind of calculations we\nagain did not perform any tie line construction to account for heterogeneous\nphases, which would result in a true ground-state phase diagram.\nOn both cubic parent lattices, the respective minimum formation energy is\nnearly exclusively negative inside the Gibbs triangle. Only close to the binaries or to the pure elements, Ef(fm) reaches positive values in selected cases.\nThe topology of the formation energy landscape appears to be very similar\non the two parent lattices. Generally, Ef(fm) exhibits the largest negative values around the region with 50% Al, with a deep valley leading towards the\nNi50 Al50 composition (Fig. 3a). Important information concerning the relative\nstability of the two cubic parent lattices is provided by Fig. 3b which displays\nthe difference between the obtained formation energies for phases on the bcc\nand the fcc lattice. Clearly seen is that the phases on the fcc lattice dominates\nthe Ni-rich and the Al-rich region of Ni-Fe-Al. The range where the homogeneous phases on the bcc lattice have lower formation energy than those\non the fcc lattice resembles a belt shape, oriented along Fe-NiAl. Thereby,\ntwo stability centers may be identified. One is located at NiAl and the other\ndistinct one is centered at the Fe corner of the triangle. The bridge between\nthese centers becomes very fragile around the NiFe2 Al composition, indicating\na strong competition with phases on the fcc lattice in this region. This competition was already experimentally verified in early studies of the Ni-Fe-Al\nsystem (see [22] and references therein). The nearby problematic Fe3 Al section\n(see section 3.1.2) underlines the delicate energetics in this area. Regarding\nthe influence of ferromagnetism on the formation energy (see Figs. 3c,d), it is\nobvious that the main magnetic energy contributions arise for Fe-rich alloys.\nOn the fcc lattice, the magnetic energy contribution exhibits maxima around\nNiFe and Fe3 Al, whereas on the bcc lattice one deep funnel centered at the\nFe corner appears. In general, the behaviour of the cluster-expanded fm moment follows mainly the one of the magnetic energy over the Gibbs triangle.\n11\n\n\fAlthough the influence of magnetism is manifest in the Fe-rich region, even\nfor compositions without a dominant fraction of Fe the magnetic energy gain\nfor a wide range of alloys is still larger than 50 meV/atom. Hence, a neglect\nof this important energy term could lead to a qualitatively wrong picture of\nthe Ni-Fe-Al system. Finally, we checked for the importance of higher cluster\ncorrelations on the bcc lattice. Fig. 3e shows the difference between Ef(fm) in\ntetrahedron and in pentahedron approximation. Additionally, in Fig. 3f the\nrelaxed pentahedron approximation (rP-CE) was utilized to calculate this difference. One can observe that the tetrahedron approximation is not too bad\nfor the bcc stability region. Deviations of the order of \u00b120 meV/atom are\nsurely comparable to the underlying DFT-GGA errors. Significant impact of\nthe higher correlations appears for the Ni-rich, and by turning on the effect\nof structural relaxations, also for the Al-rich region. In both cases the higher\ncluster correlations tend to further lower the optimal formation energy. This\neffect is intuitively clear for the Al-rich region because of the different atomic\nsizes of the transition metal atoms and the Al atom. By structural relaxations,\nthe system can reduce internal stress by lifting the constraints for the atomic\npositions imposed by the unperturbed parent lattice. Generally, for structures\nwith cubic symmetry the ordering energy is small in the Al-rich region. The\nenergy gain for Ni-rich bcc-alloys by taking into account larger clusters might\nbe due to the fact that the bcc parent lattice is not energetically favorable\nin this region. The larger clusters stabilize structures with bigger unit cell,\nfor which the locally defined \"bcc character\" diminishes. In other words, the\nstabilization of large unit cells against small unit cells indicates a low ordering\nenergy on the given parent lattice. Recall that Ni-rich Ni-Fe-Al belongs to the\nregion where phases on the fcc lattice are energetically favorable.\nIn order to quantify the predictive power of our ternary CEs, we present at the\nend of these T =0 considerations a ground state investigation for the NiFeAl2\ncomposition. Remember that our Metropolis-inspired algorithm determines\nthe lowest-energy ordered structure for a given composition. However, this\nstructure is only stable if in the diagram of the formation energy vs. compostion its formation energy lies below the tie line connecting the formation\nenergies of at least two neighbouring phases. Otherwise, a heterogeneous mixture of the corresponding phases is thermodynamically more stable than the\nhomogeneous phase. When we want to check for a ternary system the stability of the lowest-energy ordered structure for a given composition, we in\nprinciple have to investigate the position of its formation energy relative to\nthe tie lines corresponding to all possible neighbouring phases in all directions of the Gibbs triangle [34]. Because this is very time-consuming, after\nchecking the energetics of the binaries, i.e., Figs. 2a,b, we confined the detailed study to the NiAl\u2212FeAl quasibinary. As from the latter check, due to\nthe strongly negative formation energy of B2-NiAl and B2-FeAl, phases on\nthe NiAl\u2212FeAl quasibinary line appear to be the most promising competitors\nagainst an homogeneous phase at NiFeAl2 . Note that the NiAl\u2212FeAl line also\nserves as a boundary for the importance of ferromagnetism with increasing\n12\n\n\fAl content (see Fig. 3c), i.e., ordering tendencies along this line are also interesting from that point of view. From experiment, no ordered structure is\nknown for NiFeAl2 . In Fig. 4a the formation energies along NiAl\u2212FeAl according to the different CEs are plotted. First, the fcc T-CE yields a noticeably\nhigher formation energy curve than the simple B2-NiAl\u2212B2-FeAl tie line, i.e.,\nthe fcc parent lattice provides no promising candidates concerning an ordered\nground state. Turning to the bcc lattice, the Ef(fm) curve belonging to the T-CE\nis nearly identical to the straight B2-NiAl\u2212B2-FeAl tie line, and the simple\nHeusler L21 structure (see Fig. 5a) is nearly pinned to this line (the other\ncanonical bcc structure with symmertry F4\u03043m lies much higher in energy).\nOn the other hand, the Ef(fm) curves originating from the pentahedron CEs\nrun clearly below the B2-NiAl\u2212B2-FeAl tie line and display a convex behavior close to NiFeAl2 . Hence from the latter, an ordered ground state seems\nlikely at this stoichiometry. Two structures, here named \"G1\" and \"G2\" (see\nFig. 5b,c), found by means of the higher pentahedron CEs, are located in the\nfavourable energy range. Actually, the G1 structure was identified as stable\nwithin a first higher cluster approximation beyond the tetrahedron approximation. By refining the CE into the final P-CE, now with G1 belonging to\nthe set of input structures of the respective SIM, we finally obtained the G2\nstructure as the stable ordered structure for this composition. Tab. 5 lists the\nrelevant data for the competing structures at NiFeAl2 . The structures found\nfrom the CE investigation are by construction fixed on the rigid bcc parent\nlattice, since in the CE the total energy including the relaxation energy is\nrepresented as a function of configurations on the undistorted parent lattice.\nIn reality, the structures G1 and G2 possess tetragonal symmetry, and only\nfor the G2 structure no forces appear in the bcc configuration. The G1 structure consists of alternating [100] Ni, Al and Fe planes. When actually relaxing\nG1 within the MBPP code, the Al planes are shifted towards the Fe planes.\nStill, structurally relaxing the G1 structure does not shift its formation energy below the value for G2 within the full electronic structure method. The\ncorresponding formation energies obtained via the P-CE and rP-CE are very\nclose to the MBPP reference values and one yields the same energetic hierachy\nbetween the structures, showing the quantitative reliability of the constructed\nCEs. Concerning the curvature of the P-CE and rP-CE minimum formation\nenergy curves, the overall progression between NiAl and FeAl excludes a tie\nline construction that destabilizes the G2 structure. Moreover, it appears that\nat cFe =0.125 there might be another pronounced ordering tendency, indicated\nby a convex kink in the P-CE and rP-CE curves. This opens the possibility\nfor an additional ordered state at Ni3 FeAl4 within the given constraints. Concerning the behavior of the magnetic moment, the situation is delicate. As in\nDFT LDA/GGA ordered B2-NiAl is nonmagnetic and ordered B2-FeAl shows\nferromagnetism, an onset of the latter must appear on the NiAl\u2212FeAl line.\nFrom the CE calculations, already close to B2-NiAl a fm moment should be\nexpected. On the contrary, the MBPP calculations reveal no resulting magnetic moment for G1 and G2. Interestingly, close to the FeAl stoichiometry\n13\n\n\fthe magnetic moment strongly differs for different CEs. The complex interplay\nbetween structure and magnetism in the FeAl region is thus again manifest.\n\n3.2 Finite temperature phase diagram\n\nIn this last section we want to discuss our result for the ternary Ni-Fe-Al phase\ndiagram at finite temperature, investigated within the CVM using the ab-inito\nECIs for the energetics. The full ternary phase diagram is the result of the\ninterplay of a large number of different mutually coupled degrees of freedom.\nBecause of the complexity of the problem we had to adopt approximations\non several levels. For completeness, we like to list these approximations in the\nfollowing.\na. For the Fe-rich part of the phase diagram there is a very delicate interplay\nbetween electronic correlations, magnetism and structure [29,15,16,35,19],\nand for an accurate description of some of the binary Fe-Al subsystems\nit seems that one has to go beyond the LDA/GGA to the exchangecorrelation energy of the DFT. In order to make the calculations for the\nwhole ternary phase diagram feasible, we nevertheless adopted PBE-GGA\nfor the construction of the ECIs.\nb. We take into account the effect of magnetism by allowing for a possible fm\nalignment of the magnetic moments, but the effect of thermal magnetic\nexcitations is neglected.\nc. We take into account the configurational entropy within the CVM, but\nthe contributions of phonons and single-electron excitations to the free\nenergy are neglected.\nd. The effect of vacancies is neglected although vacancies are, at least, important for the Ni-Al phases on the bcc parent lattice [33].\ne. There are a few complex low-symmetry phases existing in the Al-rich part\nof Ni-Fe-Al. We, however, allow only for phases on a bcc or fcc parent\nlattice.\nf. For the internal energy and the entropy we employed the tetrahedron\napproximation on the bcc and fcc parent lattice to the CVM. This allows\nus to consider only phases with up to four sublattices [32].\ng. Due to the short range and the small number of degrees of freedom in the\ntetrahedron approximation, it seems not meaningful to include effects of\nlocal atomic relaxations, albeit they are surely important. Hence we did\nnot include such effects which would require to consider a correspondigly\nenlarged set of reference structures in a least-mean-squares fitted SIM.\nIn view of these approximations we can not expect to be able to describe all\nthe details of the physics of the ternary phase diagram. However, we think\nthat the gross features and the qualitative trends are reproduced correctly. In\n14\n\n\fthis section we only present our major results for the incoherent bcc/fcc phase\ndiagram. Additional considerations for T 6=0, also for the binary subsystems,\ncan be found in [33,40].\nWe begin with a discussion of the ternary phase diagram computed at T =1250\nK as shown in Fig. 6. Starting at low Al concentration, there is a wide heterogeneous B2\u2212A1 phase mixture stabilized up to 50% Al. Due to the low\nordering energy in the upper half of the Gibbs triangle, there are only a few\ncomplicated single-phase structures with rather big unit cells ([23] and references therein). These structures can not be represented in the tetrahedron\napproximation, and thus are not considered in our investigation. A rather\nbroad B2 phase is stabilized in the center of the Gibbs triangle. The other\nstable phases are also ternary extensions of the known stable binary phases.\nRemarkably, the B2 phase varies continuously from NiAl to FeAl, i.e., B2-NiAl\nand B2-FeAl are soluble into one another over a wide composition range. However, our calculations also reveal a miscibility gap (MG) within the ternary\nB2-(Ni,Fe)Al phase along the Fe\u2212NiAl direction which is already known from\nexperiments [22,41]. Our approach allows for the identification of the two different B2 phases involved in the MG. The first B2 phase is mainly oriented\nalong NiAl\u2212FeAl and can be defined by stating that the occupation of the Al\nsublattice of the B2 structure is strongly dominated by the Al atoms, whereas\nthe substitution processes of Ni and Fe takes place solely via the transition\nmetal sublattice. This type of microstructure was already found in our ground\nstate calculations along NiAl\u2212FeAl (section 3.1.3). The second B2 phase develops for higher Fe concentration along A2-Fe\u2212B2-NiAl. There, the majority\nFe atoms now also manifestly replace Al atoms on their sublattice, i.e., the Fe\natoms are not anymore mainly restricted to the transition metal sublattice.\nThe latter type of B2 phase obviously triggers the continuous B2\u2212A2 transition towards the Fe corner. The location of the MG is close to the region\nwere the overall stability of the parent bcc lattice is rather delicate (see Fig.\n3b). Hence, the appearance of the MG may be related to the exisiting of the\ntwo distinct minima, i.e., one at the NiAl stoichiometry and the other in the\nFe corner, in the formation energy landscape for homogeneous phases on the\nbcc parent lattice, as discussed in section 3.1.3. In connection to this it seems\nthat by starting from B2-FeAl the sole transformation of the Fe sublattice into\nan Ni sublattice when going towards the NiAl stoichiometry, as well as the\nsole vanishing of the Al sublattice when going towards the Fe corner, can be\naccomplished continuously. In contrast, the system gets somehow \"frustrated\"\nwhen the two B2 sublattices have to be transformed simultaneously, as it happens when going along the FeAl\u2212Ni line. Then it is thermodynamically more\nfavourable to eventually open the MG and stabilize a heterogeneous mixture\nof two B2 phases. Finally, by continuing along the FeAl-Ni line this MG also\nbreaks down and a full B2\u2212A2 mixture becomes stable. Note that a \"stoichiometric splitting\", i.e., the formation of two lines of stability for B2-(Ni,Fe)Al\nis also described in the experimental work of Tan et al. [42]. We think that\nthe confirmation of the MG is a very big success of our ab-initio statistical\n15\n\n\fmechanics in view of the fact that it does not involve any fit parameter.\nThe topology of the obtained ab-initio phase diagram at T =1250 K matches\nnicely the one of the experimental phase diagram around 670 K published in\nthe book of Sauthoff [9]. We want to remark on two specific problems concerning the latter comparison. First, due to the wrong stabilization of the L12\nstructure instead of the D03 structure for Fe3 Al at T =0K in PBE-GGA, the\nL12 -Fe3 Al phase also appears as a stable phase in our calculated ternary phase\ndiagram. Second, in nature fcc-Fe is stabilized against bcc-Fe at T =1250 K.\nThe corresponding allotropic transformation, mainly driven by phonons, can\nof course not be reproduced by our approach. The matching of our high-T\nphase diagram with the experimental one at much lower temperatures may\nbe due to the limitations of the tetrahedron approximation and the fact that\nDFT calculations often tend to overestimate the formation energy. Our phase\ndiagram at 1250 K does not include the L12 -Ni3 Fe phase although we have\nidentified the corresponding configuration as a ground-state structure. This\nis due to the fact that the binary Ni3 Fe phase already disorders at 660 K\nin our CVM examinations of binary Ni-Fe [40], and it is surely not expected\nthat a ternary continuation of Ni3 Fe leads to a tremendeous increase of the\norder-disorder transition temperature TNi(dis)\n. Thus in order to investigate the\n3 Fe\nphase stability of possible ternary Ni3 Fe we calculated the incoherent Ni-FeAl phase diagram also at 500 K (Fig. 7), but only in the Ni-Fe-NiAl triangle\nof the full Gibbs triangle. In addition to the already exisiting phases at 1250\nK, indeed there is now also a Ni3 Fe phase with L12 symmetry. Surprisingly,\na ternary Ni3 Fe phase was not indicated in the experimental phase diagram\naround 670 K from Ref. [9], although the experimental value of TNi(dis)\nmounts\n3 Fe\nup to 790 K [13]. In our calculation Ni3 Fe and Ni3 Al are well soluble into one\nanother over a wide composition range, in analogy to the case of B2. Moreover,\nwithin the given approximations there is also a miscibility gap (MG) existing in this generic L12 phase. Further calculations revealed that this L12 -MG\nhas vanished at 600 K, thus the MG should be confined to the low temperature regime. Experimental investigations to test these latter low temperature\nresults are highly desirable.\n\n3.3 Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, we have presented a first-principles modelling of the technologically important Ni-Fe-Al system. The emphasis of our work is on the completeness of the description rather then on specific details of this complex ternary\nsystem. Hence, approximations, both on a physical and numerical level, had\nto be applied to render the approach feasible. Although some of these approximations surely have to be removed in detailed analyses of certain properties\nof Ni-Fe-Al, we think that our approach yields important information for an\nidentification of the relevant physical processes and interactions that have\n16\n\n\fdominant influence in this intermetallic system. For instance, we have shown\nthat the influence of magnetism is not negligible for a vast composition range.\nThe atomic ordering in the ternary B2 phase is another interesting result,\nnot only from the point of view of basic research but also concerning the\nmanufacturing of new alloys with varying Fe content. Generally, in spite of\nthe complexity of the problem, our rather simple approach yields encouraging\nagreement with the real Ni-Fe-Al system. Of course, more specialized theoretical and experimental work is needed. Thus, we hope to generally stimulate\nfurther reseach on this and other multicomponent intermetallic systems, since\nthey provide a fascinating variety of interacting physical processes due to the\nenlarged number of degrees of freedom. After all, such systems are generally\nof higher technological relevance than the more restricted binary systems.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)\nunder the project No. FA 196/9-1.\n\nReferences\n[1] Statics and Dynamics of Alloy Phase Transformations, edited by P.E.A.
