INTRODUCTION\n\nThe nature of Dark Matter remains one of the outstanding questions of modern astrophysics. The success of the Cold Dark Matter cosmological model argues strongly in favor of a major component of the\ndark matter being in the form of elementary particles, not yet discovered. Based on earlier theoretical considerations, a possible link between the recent\nSPI/INTEGRAL measurement of an intense and extended emission of 511 keV photons (the hallmark of\npositron annihilation) from the central Galaxy, and\nthis mysterious component of the Universe, has been\nestablished advocating the existence of a light dark\nmatter (LDM) particle (at variance with the neutralino, in general considered as very heavy).\nWe show that it can explain the 511 keV emission\nmapped with SPI/INTEGRAL without overproducing undesirable signals like high energy gamma-rays\narising from \u03c0 \u25e6 decays, and radio synchrotron photons emitted by high energy positrons circulating in\nmagnetic fields. Combining the annihilation line constraint with the cosmological one (i.e. that the relic\nLDM energy density reaches about 23% of the density of the Universe), one can restrict the main properties of the light dark matter particle. Its mass\nshould lie between \u2248 1 and 100 MeV, and the required annihilation cross section, velocity dependent,\nshould be significantly larger than for weak interactions, and may be induced by the virtual production\nof a new light neutral spin 1 boson U .\nOn astrophysical grounds, the best target to validate\nthe LDM proposal seems to be the observation by\nSPI/INTEGRAL and future gamma ray telescopes\nof the annihilation line from the Sagittarius dwarf\ngalaxy and the Palomar-13 globular cluster, thought\nto be dominated by dark matter.\n\nIn the currently popular Cold Dark Matter (CDM)\ncosmological model with a cosmological constant \u039b,\nthe Universe is composed of \u2248 4 % baryonic matter\nand \u2248 23 % cold, collision-less dark matter, and is\nmade flat by a cosmological constant (Spergel et al.,\n2003). The very nature of dark matter is one of the\ntantalizing and yet unanswered questions of contemporary astrophysics. While its existence has been\ninferred for several decades, its amount has been\nclearly assessed on various astrophysical scales only\nin the recent past. The timed questions are its distribution and above all its true nature. The precise\nknowledge of its density profile is likely to be decisive\nin answering the ultimate question of the identification of the kind of particle(s) composing dark matter. The success of the CDM cosmology, combined\nwith dark energy (\u039b), argues strongly for a major\ncomponent of the dark matter being in the form of\nfundamental (supersymmetric?) particles.\n\nKey words: Galaxy center; dark matter; gamma\nrays.\n0 Corresponding author: m.casse@cea.fr\nInstitut d'Astrophysique de Paris, 98 bis Boulevard Arago,\n75014 Paris, France\n4 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de Recherche Astroparticule et Cosmologie,\nColl\u00e8ge de France, 11 Place Marcellin Berthelot, 75231 Paris,\nFrance\n3\n\nOne possible way of probing the nature of dark matter particles is to look for their annihilation signal\n(annihilation of dark matter particles on their antiparticles, knowing that both could be identical). The\nbest regions to search for this annihilation radiation\nis where dark matter accumulates, i.e. in deep gravitational potential wells. The annihilation rate is proportional to the square of the number density of the\ndark matter particles (in the case where dm = dm).\nThe Galactic Center and its surroundings are therefore obvious targets because of their density and\nproximity.\nA wide literature exists on the prospects of observing dark-matter-induced gamma rays from the\nGalactic Center and clumps of dark matter in the\nGalactic halo (Bertone et al. (2002) and references\ntherein). But these gamma rays are at high energy, outside the INTEGRAL grasp, and are prime\ntargets for high energy gamma ray satellite experiments (like GLAST), and atmospheric Cherenkov\ntelescopes (such as HESS, VERITAS, MAGIC and\nCANGAROO). In the following, however, we advocate a link between dark matter and low energy\n\n\f2\ngamma rays, within the reach of INTEGRAL.\n511 keV photons are the signature of electronpositron annihilations.\nRecent observations of\n511 keV photons from the central region of the\nGalaxy, performed by the SPI spectrometer on\nboard of the INTEGRAL satellite (Jean et al.,\n2003; Kn\u00f6dlseder et al., 2003; Jean et al., 2004;\nWeidenspointner et al., 2004) confirm previously\nreported observations (Leventhal et al., 1993;\nMilne et al., 2002) and improve the spatial resolution. The SPI/INTEGRAL data indicate that the\n511 keV emission zone is spherically symmetric, best\nfitted by a gaussian distribution with 9\u25e6 (FWHM),\nand inconsistent with a single point source (although\nit is premature to exclude multiple point sources).\nThe large extension of the emission region around\nthe Galactic Center combined with the surprising\nfailure of the leading candidates (SN Ia), as shown\nin Schanne et al. (2004), opens the way to new\nspeculations. A possible link between the 511 keV\nemission line mapped by SPI/INTEGRAL and a\nnew kind of dark matter, bosonic and light, that had\nbeen discussed previously (Boehm, Enssling & Silk,\n2002; Boehm & Fayet, 2003) was proposed by\nBoehm et al. (2004), since other, more conventional,\nexplanations are questionable.\n\nhypernovae (Podsiadlowski et al., 2004) seems insufficient to fulfil the positron constraint, however advocating the existence of a stellar burst in the last million years in the Galactic Center able to trigger the\nbipolar galactic wind makes the situation less desperate (Schanne et al., 2004). Thus \u03b2 + radioactivity\nfrom freshly synthesized nuclei remains a possibility\nbut still fragile. Other potential sources of positrons\nabound, but they appear considerably weaker than\nSN Ia and hypernovae of the SN2003dh type: flare\nstars, low mass X ray binaries (LMXRB) (Prantzos,\n2004), more particularly micro-quasars. In general\nall of these candidates remain problematic since the\nrequired injection rate of positrons in the Galactic\nbulge as deduced from the SPI/INTEGRAL measurement is impressively high compared to their possibilities. Moreover their distributions do not fit with\nthe 511 keV photon one (Paul et al., 2004).\nIn the absence of a solid astrophysical explanation\nit is worth considering that the galactic 511 keV\nline emission may be of a radically different origin\n(i.e. not of nuclear origin), opening the door to new\nphysics, independently of supersymmetry (or possibly beyond it).\n3. DISMISS OF HEAVY NEUTRALINOS\n\n2. THE FAILURE OF SN IA AND\nDIFFICULTIES OF HYPERNOVAE\nThe story begins with the fact that the most generous positron sources proposed up to now, supernovae SN Ia, fall short of explaining the intensity of\nthe measured 511 keV emission line from the central part of the Galaxy, reminiscent from the Galactic bulge. Strangely enough, this point has remained\nunnoticed until recently (Cass\u00e9 et al., 2004), whereas\nit is already apparent in the OSSE/GRO data. Indeed the Galactic bulge is like a tiny elliptical galaxy\nembedded in a spiral. Thus scaling the supernova\nrate to that of elliptical galaxies, as a function of the\nmass (Cappellaro et al., 2003), we get a small explosion rate, \u2248 0.03 SN Ia per century (Schanne et al.,\n2004), insufficient to explain the required positron\ninjection rate of about 1043 s\u22121 , given the low escape fraction of positrons from SN Ia (Milne et al.,\n2002).\nThe striking roundness of the emission, reminiscent of the Galactic bulge, leads naturally to propose a whole population of unresolved sources lying in the Galactic bulge, i.e. old and small mass\nstars (single or in binary systems), or stellar remnants. But one cannot exclude that a recent event\nlike SN2003dh linked to the young population sitting in the Central Molecular Bulge, a region of\nactive star formation (Figer, 2004), has injected a\nlarge amount of positrons that have invaded the\nbulge (Parizot et al., 2004) with the help of oriented\nand ordered magnetic fields, non thermal filaments\n(Yusef-Zadeh & Konigl, 2004) and a bipolar galactic\nwind (Bland-Hawthorn & Cohen, 2003). The rate of\n\nThe foremost candidate for the cold dark matter\ncomposing galactic halos is the lightest supersymmetric particle, in general a neutralino \u03c7 (combination of neutral gauginos and higgsinos), protected\nfrom decay by R-parity conservation in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model (Fayet,\n1977; Farrar & Fayet, 1978). As such, the neutralino\nis stable and can serve as a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle, or WIMP. The relic density of neutralinos can be identified with the one deduced from\nobservations (WMAP), given that they are weakly\ncoupled to matter, and that their mass is expected\nto be very large. In fact, collider experiments now\nconstrain m\u03c7 >\n\u223c 50 GeV, although this lower bound\ndepends on some specific hypothesis. Obtaining the\nappropriate relic density of dark matter particles also\nrequires, in general, m\u03c7 <\n\u223c 500 GeV at most (excepted for narrow specific regions in the parameter\nspace).\nThese particles, being of the Majorana type, are\ntheir own antiparticles, and they can annihilate in\nthe central region of the Galaxy, where they accumulate. Their annihilations proceed in various ways,\ndepending on their mass (and on the parameters of\nthe specific models considered). In addition to the\ndirect e+ e\u2212 annihilation channel, there are many\nother possible channels that ultimately lead also to\npositrons through cascade decays (Baltz et al., 2002;\nPeirani et al., 2004; Prada et al., 2004). These annihilation reactions depend on a number of free parameters of the theory, at least five in the simplest case\n(and in general significantly more).\nPositrons could be produced by neutralino annihilations in the central region of the Galaxy. In this case\n\n\f3\nthe observed 511 keV emission could be the result\nof a double annihilation process \u03c7 \u03c7 \u2192 e+ + ... ,\nfollowed by e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 . Neutralino pair annihilations may lead to the emission of gamma rays\nand high energy positrons through various decay\nchannels which may imply the production of W \u00b1\nand Z bosons, as well as quark anti-quark pairs.\nThis leads in particular to the production of neutral\nand charged pions, decaying eventually into photons,\nelectrons and positrons, as follows:\n\u03c7 \u03c7 \u2192 W + W \u2212 ( or Z Z ) , ... ,\nq q\u0304\n\uf8f1 0\n\u03c0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03c0+\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2212\n\u03c0\n\n\u2192 \u03c0 + ... ,\n\u2192\n\n\u03b3\u03b3\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03bc\n\n+\n\n,\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03bc\u2212 \u2192 e \u2212 .\n\n\u2192 e+ ,\n\nNeutralino annihilations not only generate neutral\npions which decay into \u03b3\u03b3, but also a similar number\nof charged pions that decay ultimately into positrons\nand electrons, the number of high energy photons\nper positron (or electron) produced being roughly of\nthe order of unity. If one assumes that positrons\nin the central region of the Galaxy originate from\nneutralino annihilations, a large flux of high energy\ngamma rays would then ensue, in strong contradiction with the EGRET upper limit. Moreover, explaining the positron rate responsible for the 511 keV\nemission from the central region of the Galaxy in\nterms of neutralino annihilations (at a rate of about\n1043 s\u22121 ) would lead to a strong overestimate of\nthe radio emission of this region in the presence of\nmagnetic fields, the electrons and positrons produced\ngenerating excessive synchrotron radiation.\nIn addition, the positrons are emitted at high energy due to the large mass of the neutralino, generally considered to be heavier than about 50 GeV.\nSince positron annihilations should take place almost at rest, the positrons should lose almost all\ntheir kinetic energy before annihilating. The very\nlarge kinetic energy of such positrons (and similarly\nelectrons, ...) should then be radiated (in various\nways, synchrotron emission, bremsstrahlung, inverse\nCompton) and the whole region should shine brightly\nat different wavelengths, from radio to gamma rays,\nwhich is not observed (Paul et al., 2004). It seems\nthus that heavy neutralinos must be discarded as the\npositron source required by the INTEGRAL 511 keV\nmeasurement.\nHowever, the possibility that high energy gamma\nrays may be identified by forthcoming atmospheric\nCherenkov telescopes (CANGOROO, VERITAS,\nHESS) or satellite borne detectors (like GLAST) excites considerable interest (Taylor & Silk, 2003). In\nview of this, it is interesting to note that theories inspired from supersymmetry or extended supersymmetry may lead to two stable dark matter particles (Boehm & Fayet, 2003), a light one that may\nbe responsible for the 511 keV line, and a heavy one\nfor high energy gamma rays (Boehm, Fayet & Silk,\n\n2003).\n\n4. LIGHT DARK MATTER\nWeakly-interacting stable massive neutral particles,\ntaken as possible dark matter candidates, should not\nbe too light, otherwise they would not have been able\nto annihilate sufficiently in the early Universe, and\nwould therefore overclose it. The best motivated candidate is the heavy neutralino, considered in Section\n3. On the other hand, before the recent observations\nof the 511 keV gamma ray line from the Galactic\nCenter, it was shown that light spin 0 dark matter\nparticles could indeed exist (Boehm & Fayet, 2003),\nas an alternative to the standard scenario of heavy\nWIMPs, and indicated that \"a gamma ray signature\nfrom the galactic center at low energy could be due\nto the existence of a light new gauge boson\", responsible for the annihilations of such light dark matter\nparticles.\nFor light dark matter (LDM) particles to exist, we\nneed new efficient mechanisms responsible for their\npair annihilations \u2013 otherwise they would normally,\nby far, overclose the Universe. But on the other\nhand they should have no significant direct coupling to the Z boson, otherwise they would have\nbeen produced copiously in Z decays at LEP. Still\nthey would have to annihilate sufficiently, and in fact\nmuch more strongly than through ordinary weak interactions, otherwise their relic density would be too\nlarge! How can this be possible ?\nThese annihilations (at an appropriate rate) may indeed result from the virtual production of a new neutral spin 1 gauge boson U, light but very weakly coupled, such as one introduced long ago, with the standard SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) gauge group of strong\nand electroweak interactions extended to include a\nnew, spontaneously broken, extra U (1) symmetry\n(Fayet, 1980, 1981, 1990). But on the other hand,\na large annihilation cross section of LDM particles\ncould lead to an excessive production of gamma rays\nfrom the Galactic Center, if mdm is less than about\n100 MeV (Boehm, Enssling & Silk, 2002), above\nwhat is really observed by the CGRO experiments\nOSSE, COMPTEL and EGRET (Hasinger, 1996;\nSreekumar et al., 1998). This indicates that LDM\nparticles should have a velocity dependent annihilation cross section: the cross section for the late annihilations of residual dark matter particles should be\nat least \u2248 105 , 103 or 102 times smaller than estimated at the freeze out epoch, for mdm = 1, 10 or\n100 MeV, respectively.\nIt may indeed be possible to reconcile a sufficiently large annihilation cross section at freeze out\n(just after the big-bang), with an acceptable rate\nof gamma ray and positron production at present\nepoch, if the average of the product of the an-\n\n\f4\nnihilation cross section with the velocity of LDM\n< \u03c3ann v > is proportional to v 2 , automatically\nsuppressing the late annihilation of relic dark matter particles (Boehm, Enssling & Silk, 2002). This\nrequirement is naturally satisfied for annihilations\ninduced through the virtual production of a light\nU boson, which shows that the idea of light dark\nmatter particles is indeed viable. Other constraints\nfrom various particle physics experiments also appear compatible with this hypothesis, the smallness\nof the U couplings to ordinary particles, as compared\nto the electromagnetic coupling e, by several orders\nof magnitude, accounting for the fact that neither\nthis U boson, nor the light dark matter candidate \u2013\nwhich may have spin 0, or also spin 21 \u2013 has been observed yet (Boehm & Fayet, 2003; Fayet, 2004). In\naddition, the U boson should be vectorially coupled\nto ordinary matter particles, so as to avoid a problematic axion-like behavior of its longitudinal polarization state.\nNow, can the Galactic Center positron source be\nidentified with the lower dark halo, occupied by\nLDM particles, which by annihilation would produce\npositrons?\n1. In order to have a 511 keV photon flux at the\nobserved level, one needs a sufficient rate of positron\nannihilations in the central zone (while for a given\ndark matter density the number density of dark matter particles is inversely proportional to their mass).\nThis requires, in turn, significantly smaller masses\nthan the \u223c GeV \u2013 TeV mass range preferred by most\nWIMP models.\n2. The produced e+ must slow down to rest before annihilation. In order to prevent leakage from\nthe bulge region, the positrons produced should have\nrather low energy. This again puts dark matter particles in the mass range of 1 \u2013 100 MeV (Boehm et al.,\n2004).\n3. There is, furthermore, a preference for the lower\nend of the above mass interval, so as to avoid relatively energetic positrons and electrons from dark\nmatter annihilations to lead to too much energy dissipated in gamma rays, ...\nExisting relic density constraints (e.g. 0.094 <\n\u03a9dm h2 < 0.129) at 2\u03c3 from WMAP (Spergel et al.,\n2003), together with the required annihilation rate\nat the present time in the halo, can be recovered,\nprovided the mean annihilation cross section times\nvelocity (< \u03c3ann v >) behaves as the square of the\ndark matter velocity. Recent big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations in presence of LDM particles have been performed, showing that these particles can lower the production of 4 He and deuterium.\nFor a mass between 4 and 10 MeV they even improve the agreement between the abundances predicted and the primordial ones derived from observations (Serpico & Raffelt, 2004).\nTo summarize, a small mass together with a large annihilation cross section into e+ e\u2212 pairs \u2013 as it can\nresult from a new gauge interaction \u2013 are required\nfor such Light Dark Matter particles. Other possible\n\nexplanations in terms of decays of long-lived (quasistable) rather light relic particles (such as sterile neutrinos, or axinos with Rp -violating decays) into e+ e\u2212\npairs have also been proposed (Picciotto & Pospelov,\n2004; Hooper & Wang, 2004).\n\n5. DARK MATTER DENSITY PROFILE\nAND CLUMPINESS\nOne of the keys of the problem is the distribution\nof the 511 keV emission projected on the sky. Indeed the emissivity depends both on particle physics\nparameters and on purely astrophysical ones. Formally, the local emissivity depends on the square of\nthe dark matter density modulated by the distribution of electrons on which positrons annihilate, integrated on the line of sight in various directions,\nand integrated again over the opening angle of the\ndetector:\n\u03a6511 (r) \u221d \u03c1\u03c7 (r)2 ne (r) .\nIt is clearly of importance to calculate the distribution of the annihilation signal and to compare it with\nthe SPI/INTEGRAL observations. Unfortunately\nthis is plagued with uncertainties. On one hand, the\ndark matter distribution is still highly debated and\non the other hand, the gas content and distribution\nin the bulge are poorly known. We then have to rely\non purely theoretical arguments.\nWithin the framework of the \u039b-CDM model, the\ngrowth of structures is seeded by a nearly scaleinvariant spectrum of density fluctuations, supposedly generated during cosmological inflation. Structures form hierarchically, with small objects forming\nfirst and subsequently merging into larger structures\nover time. This widely accepted version of structure\nformation predicts the existence of a large number\nof self-bound substructures in the dark halo of our\nGalaxy (Moore et al., 1999; Stoehr et al., 2003) that\ncould give rise to an enhanced gamma ray signal due\nto annihilation of dark matter particles in the dense\ninner region (Koushiappas et al. (2003) and references therein) and positron emission as well.\nDifferent profiles for the dark matter energy density have been proposed, based on high resolution\nN -body simulations, differing vastly one from another (Moore et al., 1999; Persic & Salucci, 1998;\nNavarro, Frenk & White, 1996; Bahcall & Soneira,\n1984). If the dark matter density is cusped as 1/r\nat small radii, then the positron production, and the\ngamma ray flux as well, would be much enhanced.\nThe central massive black hole could also have an\nimpact on the dark matter distribution concentrating it in the center of the Galaxy and producing a\nspike (Bertone et al., 2002), but at the modest spatial resolution of SPI, this extra concentration would\nhave little effect. Inspired by the persistence of substructures in numerical simulations, it has been argued that a substantial signal in the gamma ray observation (in our case the positron production) can\n\n\f5\nbe expected from such clumps (sub-halos) provided\nthey are themselves cusped (Evans, Ferrer & Sarkar\n(2003) and references therein). These conclusions,\nhowever, have been contested as being unduly optimistic (Stoehr et al., 2003). Indeed, according to\nthe adopted profile, the numbers of detectable subhalos differ dramatically (Koushiappas et al., 2003)\nsince the luminosity, and therefore detectability of\na sub-halo, is given by integration of the square of\nthe dark matter density along the line of sight to\nthe sub-halo. More concretely, there is a substantial\nbody of astrophysical evidence that the halo of our\nGalaxy is not cusped at all (Evans, Ferrer & Sarkar,\n2003). This is also in line with the interpretation\nof the 511 keV angular distribution in terms of dark\nmatter annihilation, since using the simple power law\nparameterization of the dark matter energy density\n(\u03c1dm \u223c r\u2212\u03b3 near the center), the range 0.4 < \u03b3 < 0.8\nis indicated (Boehm et al., 2004). Indeed, one additional interest of the light dark matter scenario, if it\nturns out to be correct, is the possibility to probe\nthe slope (steepness) of the dark halo profile in the\ncentral region of the Milky Way, and optimistically\nits clumpiness.\nSummarizing, according to N -body simulations,\ndark substructures of masses higher than 107 M\u2299\nsurvive in significant numbers in the halo. With\nmore data coming in the future, with improved angular resolution, the 511 keV flux could provide more\ndetails on the distribution of dark matter in the inner\nGalaxy, provided the problem of the positron annihilation is clarified. The annihilation medium (except\nin the Central Molecular Zone) is very diluted. The\npositron annihilation rate is R(r) = n+ n\u2212 < \u03c3v > ,\nwhere n+ and n\u2212 stand as the positron and electron number densities, and \u03c3 is the positron annihilation cross section, depending on the temperature\nand density of the ambient gas. Indeed many processes compete (von Ballmoos et al. (2003) and references therein) and the physics of annihilation is\ncomplex. Careful work is required to calculate the\npositron propagation and annihilation in the conditions of the Galactic bulge, and to deduce the dark\nmatter distribution from that of the 511 keV annihilation line emission.\n\n6. EXPERIMENTAL TESTS\n6.1. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy\nToday, it seems difficult to explain the injection rate\nof positrons in the central Galaxy and the morphology of the 511 keV line emission observed by\nSPI/INTEGRAL on the basis of standard astrophysical scenarios. Thus it is worth pursuing the\nidea that the 511 keV emission is the signature of\na rather exotic process, like for instance the annihilation of positrons induced by light dark matter\nparticles in the lower dark halo of our Galaxy. If it\nis the case, it should be an universal process, that\nshould show up in favorable situations. In this line\n\nof thought, Hooper et al. (2003) have proposed to\ntest the light dark matter hypothesis on the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy (SDG), a close-by galaxy for\nwhich dark matter annihilations may be significant.\nA large dark matter annihilation rate is then predicted from this galaxy and as it contains comparatively few stars (M/L = 21 in solar units), the detection of a substantial 511 keV emission line from\nSDG would provide a strong evidence for the light\ndark matter hypothesis. The predicted flux at 511\nkeV from SDG, (1 \u2212 7) \u00d7 10\u22124 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 , is a\npriori observable by SPI/INTEGRAL, but it is still\nundetected.\nThis estimate, however, relies on a number of unverified assumptions discussed in Cordier et al. (2004),\nthe most important one being that annihilation\nof positrons effectively occurs in this environment\n(i.e. that the gas density in all forms within SDG\nand/or its halo is sufficient to guarantee an annihilation time less than the age of this galaxy). This\ncould be checked, for instance, by observations of\nthe OVI absorption line in the UV by the FUSE\nsatellite (Vidal-Madjar et al., 2004). Note also that\nthe current mass estimate of SDG is in the range\n(5 \u2212 20) \u00d7 108 M\u2299 , moreover the tidal radius is ill defined in this system. Another drawback is that the\nSDG is in a state of tidal disruption, as evidenced\nby a trail of stars and gas escaping from its core\n(Cordier et al., 2004), thus the emission should be\nmore diffuse and therefore more difficult to detect\nthan initially thought.\n\n6.2. Palomar-13\nAnother interesting target for SPI/INTEGRAL is\nPalomar-13, a quite unusual globular cluster located\nat (l, b) = (87.1\u25e6 , \u2212 42.7\u25e6) which, contrary to the\ngeneral members of its class, could be exceptionally\ndark matter rich (Cot\u00e9 et al., 2002). The luminosity of this remote (24.3 kpc) globular cluster, measured within its tidal radius (23 pc), is 2.8 \u00d7 103 L\u2299 ,\ncorresponding to \u2248 105 M\u2299 . With a M/L ratio of\nabout 40, it could be a long sought dark matter\ndense clump, very favorable to dark matter research\n(Giraud et al., 2002). Since dark matter annihilation is a two body process, the luminosity of a given\nsource scales as the integral along the line of sight of\nthe dark matter density squared (L \u223c \u03c12 R), and the\nobserved flux as \u03a6 \u223c M 2 R\u22125 D\u22122 . Applying this relationship to the Galactic Center region (located at\nD = 8 kpc, the dark matter M within a radius R = 1\nkpc depending on the radial distribution adopted)\nand to the globular cluster Palomar-13 (located at\nD = 24.3 kpc, M = 1.2 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 within R = 23\npc) we obtain the fluxes shown in Table 1. Note\nthat there is a possible drawback to the hypothesis\nof dark matter dominance. The high velocity dispersion of stars could be due to the dissolution of the\ncluster under the effect of tidal forces.\nAssuming total annihilation of the positrons released\n(i.e. no escape), we get different predictions ac-\n\n\f6\n\nTable 1.\nPrediction of the 511 keV brightness \u03a6 of Palomar-13 for different dark matter\ndistributions in our Galaxy (Moore et al., 1999;\nBahcall & Soneira, 1984; Navarro, Frenk & White,\n1996; Persic & Salucci, 1998), where M is the dark\nmatter mass enclosed within the central R = 1 kpc of\nour Galaxy.\nM/M\u2299\nMoore\nBS\nNFW\nPS\n\n2.5\n8\n3.8\n1.8\n\n109\n108\n108\n108\n\nwith the present technology based on the measurement of nuclear recoil energy, do not appear\nbright, since these direct detection experiments are\nonly sensitive to sizeable masses above about 7\nGeV (Edelweiss, DAMA & CDMS, 2002), or 1 GeV\n(Cresst (Altmann et al., 2001), MACHe3, Rosebud\nand Tokyo), and not to the light dark matter masses\nconsidered here.\n\n\u03a6 (cm\u22122 s\u22121 )\n4 10\u22125\n3.9 10\u22124\n1.7 10\u22123\n8.1 10\u22122\n\ncording to the choice of the dark matter distribution (Moore et al., 1999; Bahcall & Soneira, 1984;\nNavarro, Frenk & White, 1996; Persic & Salucci,\n1998). All but the Moore et al. (1999) one give fluxes\neasily observable by SPI/INTEGRAL. However the\nvalidity of the no escape condition of positrons is not\nguaranteed. A dedicated study of the matter content\n(supposedly rather high due to the fact that planetary ejecta do not escape from the deep gravitational\npotential well) and magnetic field of Palomar-13 is\nmandatory, and above all a demonstration of the fact\nthat it is not a dissolving cluster.\n\n7. CONCLUSION\nSummarizing, the 511 keV emission from the Galactic bulge observed by SPI/INTEGRAL could be the\nsignature of light ( \u2248 1 \u2013 100 MeV) dark matter particles, with a preference for the lower end of this mass\ninterval. Such particles could annihilate throughout the Galactic bulge into positrons (and electrons)\nwhich, after being stopped, themselves annihilate\ninto 511 keV photons. The link between the positron\nannihilation line from the central Galactic regions\nand dark matter, if real, would push INTEGRAL at\nthe forefront of astroparticle research. It is thus essential to further test this hypothesis, and to discard,\nif possible, competing ones using INTEGRAL itself\nas well as other means. For this purpose, it is crucial\nto get a detailed map of the 511 keV emission in the\ncentral region of the Galaxy.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n6.3. Terrestrial searches\nAn obvious constraint on LDM is that it has no\nsignificant direct coupling to the Z boson, otherwise it would have been discovered in Z decays at\nLEP. This is not an unreasonable requirement, since\nother putative particles like right-handed neutrinos\nand binos, for instance, subscribe to it. Again, the\nsmallness of the U coupling to ordinary matter as\ncompared to the electromagnetic one e accounts for\nthe fact that LDM particles have not been observed\nyet (Boehm & Fayet, 2003; Fayet, 2004). Such particles would have escaped detection in e+ e\u2212 colliders\nas their cross section for the production of anomalous single photons, in particular, is below the sensitivity of past experiments. Note that while U induced interactions would generally be stronger than\nweak interactions at lower energies (at which weak\ninteractions are really weak!), they would be much\nweaker at higher energies (for which weak interaction cross sections grow larger), as the result of U\npropagator effects. U exchanges could also lead to\nadditional (positive) contributions to the magnetic\nanomalies a\u03bc,e = (g\u03bc,e \u2212 2)/2 of charged leptons,\nsufficiently small to be compatible with upper limits from present experimental results and theoretical\nevaluations.\nThe prospects for detecting light dark matter particles in terrestrial (direct) dark matter searches,\n\nThe authors would like to thank C.
