We also discuss implications for the cosmic \"no-hair\" theorem for Bianchi models\nwhen part of the source is a tilted fluid.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the Bianchi models were introduced into cosmology [1,2], they have been the most studied generalizations\nof the spatially homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre (FL) models. The Bianchi models are spatially\nhomogeneous but anisotropic, and thus well suited for studying the effects of anisotropic expansion on the evolution\nof the universe. The complexity of a Bianchi model is determined by its three-dimensional symmetry group G3 ,\nin conjunction with the chosen matter model. Since the present universe seems to be very well described by a FL\nmodel, our main interest is models that can be \"close to a FL model\" at late times. In this paper we will restrict our\nconsideration to models that may approach the open FL model at late times. Within the class of Bianchi models,\nonly models of Bianchi type V and VIIh can possibly have this behavior (see Collins & Hawking [3]). This follows\nsince the open FL metric admits a G3 of these particular Bianchi types. Here we will focus on the type V models.\nThe notion of a model approaching a FL model at late times is often referred to as late-time isotropization.\nAs regards the matter description, most studies of Bianchi cosmologies use non-tilted barotropic perfect fluids with\na linear equation of state. The book by Wainwright & Ellis [4] is basically devoted to such models. In the so-called\nnon-tilted models, the fluid 4-velocity is orthogonal to the orbits of the isometry group G3 . Models in which the\n4-velocity of the fluid is not orthogonal to the group orbits are referred to as tilted, and were introduced by King &\nEllis [5]. These models have been studied by, for example, Collins & Ellis [5], Hewitt & Wainwright [6], and Harnett\n[7]. Since the non-tilted models are a subset of the tilted models, the latter can be viewed as simple generalizations\nof the former. Another generalization of non-tilted models is achieved by allowing the source of the gravitational field\nto be a combination of two non-interacting, non-tilted perfect fluids. Since these models can take into account both a\nradiation-dominated as well as a matter-dominated epoch of the universe, they may be considered as more physically\nrelevant than single-fluid models. The qualitative behavior of two-fluid models were studied by Coley & Wainwright\n[8] who showed that the models are dominated at early times by the stiffer fluid, and at late times by the softer fluid.\nThis is the expected behavior of a universe filled with radiation and dust.\nThe next step is to allow one of the fluids in a two-fluid model to be tilted, and subsequently, to let both fluids\nbe tilted. Since the dynamics of models containing tilted fluids is more difficult to analyze than that of non-tilted\nmodels, we will consider the combination of one non-tilted and one tilted fluid. The non-tilted fluid is by definition\nirrotational, but tilted fluids can rotate. We chose, however, to consider the subset of irrotational tilted fluids (For\na discussion of general single-fluid Bianchi type V models, see Harnett [7]). We are thus focusing on the subclass of\nirrotational Bianchi type V models. Both fluids are assumed to satisfy linear barotropic equations of state,\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nE-mail: goliath@physto.se\nE-mail: ulfn@physto.se\n\n1\n\n\fpo = (\u03b3o \u2212 1)\u03bco ,\npt = (\u03b3t \u2212 1)\u03bct ,\n\n(1.1a)\n(1.1b)\n\nwhere po,t are the pressures of the fluids, \u03bco,t the energy densities, and \u03b3o,t are constants that satisfy 0 \u2264 \u03b3o,t \u2264 2\nwith \u03b3o 6= \u03b3t . We exclude, however, the specific values 2/3 and 2 since these models behave qualitatively different.\nThe indices o and t refer to the orthogonal and the tilted fluid respectively and will be used throughout the paper.\nWe will also assume that the energy densities are non-negative, i.e.,\n\u03bco \u2265 0 ,\n\u03bct \u2265 0 .\n\n(1.2a)\n(1.2b)\n\nTo discuss isotropization in detail, we need a well-defined notion of when a model is \"close to a FL model\". For\nmodels with a single non-tilted fluid, a vanishing fluid shear defines the FL models (see, for example, section 2.4 in [4]).\nIt is, however, not sufficient to demand that the fluid shear itself should approach zero at late times, since this will\noccur in any single-fluid Bianchi model, irrespectively of whether the model isotropizes or not. As realized already by\nKristian & Sachs [9], the appropriate quantity to consider is the dimensionless ratio formed by normalizing the fluid\nshear with the fluid expansion, the so-called dimensionless shear. It measures the dynamical importance of the shear\ncompared to the expansion of the fluid. Since there are now two fluids present, the notion of isotropization at late\ntimes needs to be generalized as follows. We say that a two-fluid model isotropizes at late times if the dimensionless\nshear of both fluids vanish in this limit. This issue was partially addressed by Goliath & Ellis [10], who considered\nmodels with a tilted fluid and a non-zero cosmological constant. Such models are contained within the models studied\nin this paper if we set \u03b3o equal to zero. We will comment on aspects of the behavior of these models that were not\naddressed in [10]. In general, vanishing dimensionless shear is not sufficient for a model to isotropize, since models can\nbe Weyl-dominated in the future, as is the case for Bianchi type VII0 and Bianchi type VIII models [11]. However,\nfor Bianchi type V this is not the case [7].\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, the field equations are rewritten as a first-order system of autonomous\nordinary differential equations. Reduced dimensionless variables are then introduced leading to a compact state space.\nIn Sec. III we perform a local analysis of the system of equations. In Sec. IV, Bianchi type I and type V models with\ntwo orthogonal fluids are studied, while the locally rotationally symmetric type V models are considered in Sec. V.\nThe question of isotropization is discussed in detail. We end with a discussion in Sec. VI. In App. A, the kinematical\nproperties of both fluids are given. The relationship to the variables used in [8] is discussed in App. B. We use units\nsuch that c = 8\u03c0G = 1. Orthonormal frame indices are denoted by latin letters a, b, ... .\nII. THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD EQUATIONS\n\nThe line element for the irrotational Bianchi type V models can be written\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + D1 (t)2 dx2 + e\u22122x D2 (t)2 dy 2 + D3 (t)2 dz 2 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\n(see, for example, Ellis & MacCallum [12]). In the models we consider there are two preferred timelike congruences.\nFirst we have the congruence associated with the normal to the spatial symmetry surfaces, which is also, by definition,\nthe congruence of the 4-velocity of the non-tilted fluid, uao . The time variable t in (2.1) is chosen so that the normal\n\u2202\nto the symmetry surfaces is \u2202t\n. The other preferred congruence is that of the tilted fluid. The specific form of the\nline element, Eq. (2.1), guarantees that this fluid is irrotational. Hence, the 4-velocity of this fluid, uat , is constrained\nby the field equations to be of a particular form, and can conveniently be parameterized in terms of the so-called tilt\nvariable v according to\nuat = \u0393 (1, v, 0, 0) ,\n\n\u0393 = (1 \u2212 v 2 )\u22121/2 ,\n\nwhere the value v = 0 corresponds to a non-tilted fluid. The energy-momentum tensor of each fluid is\n\u0003\n\u0002\nToab = \u03b3o uao ubo + (\u03b3o \u2212 1)\u03b7 ab \u03bco ,\n\u0003\n\u0002\nTtab = \u03b3t uat ubt + (\u03b3t \u2212 1)\u03b7 ab \u03bct .\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3a)\n(2.3b)\n\nThe assumption that the two fluids are non-interacting leads to equations of motion of the form\n\u2207a Toab = 0 = \u2207a Ttab .\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fWe choose to parameterize the gravitational field using the expansion, \u03b8, and the non-vanishing components of the\nshear-tensor \u03c3\u00b1 , of the normal congruence (and thus of the non-tilted fluid). They are given by\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n3 d\n1 d\nd\nD12\nD2\n, \u03c3\u2212 =\n.\n(2.5)\nln (D1 D2 D3 ) , \u03c3+ = \u2212\nln\nln\n\u03b8=\ndt\n2 dt\nD2 D3\n2 dt\nD3\nThe expansion and shear of the tilted fluid can be written as functions of these variables, see App. A. The gravitational\nfield equations,\nGab = Toab + Ttab ,\n\n(2.6)\n\nand the equations of motion of the fluids, Eq. (2.4), become\nEvolution equations\n\u0001\n1 (3\u03b3t \u2212 2) + (2 \u2212 \u03b3t )v 2\n\u03bcn ,\n\u03c3+ 2 + \u03c3\u2212 2 \u2212 21 (3\u03b3o \u2212 2)\u03bco \u2212\n2\n1 + (\u03b3t \u2212 1)v 2\n\u03c3\u0307+ = \u2212 (\u03b8 \u2212 2vB1 ) \u03c3+ ,\n\u03c3\u0307\u2212 = \u2212\u03b8\u03c3\u2212 ,\n\u03b8\u0307 = \u2212 31 \u03b82 \u2212\n\n2\n3\n\n\u1e021 = \u2212 31 (\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03c3+ ) B1 ,\n\n(2.7a)\n(2.7b)\n(2.7c)\n(2.7d)\n\n2\n\nv(1 \u2212 v )\n[2\u03c3+ + (3\u03b3t \u2212 4)\u03b8 \u2212 6(\u03b3t \u2212 1)B1 v] ,\n3 [1 \u2212 (\u03b3t \u2212 1)v 2 ]\n\u03bc\u0307o = \u2212\u03b3o \u03b8\u03bco .\n\n(2.7e)\n\nv\u0307 =\n\n(2.7f)\n\nConstraint equation\n0 = \u03b3t v\u03bcn + 2(1 + (\u03b3t \u2212 1)v 2 )B1 \u03c3+ .\n\n(2.7g)\n\nDefining equation for \u03bcn\n3\u03bcn = \u03b82 \u2212 \u03c3+ 2 \u2212 \u03c3\u2212 2 \u2212 9B12 \u2212 3\u03bco ,\n\n(2.7h)\n\nB1 = D1\u22121 ,\n1 + (\u03b3t \u2212 1)v 2\n\u03bct ,\n\u03bcn =\n1 \u2212 v2\n\n(2.8a)\n\nwhere we have introduced\n\n(2.8b)\n\nand a dot denotes differentiation with respect to t.\nFrom the form of Eq. (2.7h), it is now clear why our choice of variables is a good one. The assumption in Eq. (1.2),\nin conjunction with Eq. (2.7h) and Eq. (2.8b), implies that \u03b8 cannot change sign. Therefore we can, without loss of\ngenerality, assume that \u03b8 \u2265 0, i.e., we restrict ourselves to expanding models. From Eq. (2.7h) it also follows that \u03b8\nis a dominant quantity. We then introduce bounded dimensionless \"\u03b8-normalized\" variables for which the system of\nequations (2.7), is reduced as far as possible, and for which the state space is compact.

The\nvariables \u03a3+ , \u03a3\u2212 , A, v, and \u03a9o therefore satisfy 0 \u2264 \u03a32+ , \u03a3\u2212 , A, v 2 , \u03a9o \u2264 1. There is a number of important subsets of\nEqs. (2.12):\n(i) The three-dimensional subset defined by v = 0, which describes a Bianchi type V universe with two non-tilted\nfluids. This case is thus included in the general study of Coley & Wainwright [8]. We will, however, consider\nthese models in Sec. IV for the purpose of comparison with the models where one fluid is tilted. The subset\nv = 0 also contains Bianchi type I models and the open FL model as special cases.\n(ii) The three-dimensional subset \u03a3\u2212 = 0, which corresponds to locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) models (see,\nfor example, [13]). This subset turns out to be very important for the evolution of the general irrotational type\nV models and will be considered in detail in Sec. V.\nThe next step in the analysis is to consider the equilibrium points of Eq. (2.12). This is done in the next section.\nIII. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS\n\nIn Table I, we present the equilibrium points of the system (2.12). The corresponding eigenvalues are given in Table\nII. Since the constraint, Eq. (2.12f), cannot be solved globally in an analytic way, it will be treated locally (see, for\nexample, [6]).\nSome of the equilibrium points correspond to exact solutions of the field equations. For example, the equilibrium\npoints Ft0 and Fo0 correspond to flat FL models in which the tilted fluid and the non-tilted fluid is dominant, respectively (The \"tilted\" fluid is in fact non-tilted at Ft0 since v = 0, but we refer to it as the tilted fluid for simplicity).\nThe point M 0 is the Milne model, while the equilibrium set K 0 corresponds to Kasner-like models. The point M\u0303\ncorresponds to flat space and coincides with M 0 for \u03b3t = 4/3. We also note the appearance of the equilibrium set Fov\nfor the specific value \u03b3t = 43 . It is associated with a line bifurcation that transfers stability between the equilibrium\npoints Fo\u00b1 and Fo0 . The points C \u00b1 correspond to particular Kasner solutions. There is also a number of equilibrium\npoints for which the tilt is extreme (v 2 = 1). Whether these equilibrium points correspond to exact Bianchi solutions\nor not seems to be an open question (see comment on p. 4245 in [6]). We note that the constraint, Eq. (2.12f), is\ndegenerate (\u2207G = 0) at the point Fo0 , allowing all five eigenvector directions to be physical at this point.\n\n4\n\n\fFt0\nFo0\nM0\nK0\nM\u0303\nC\u00b1\nFov\nFo\u00b1\nM\u00b1\nK\u00b1\nH\n\n\u03a3+\n0\n0\n0\n\n\u03a3\u2212\n0\n0\n0\n\u03a32+ + \u03a32\u2212 = 1\n\n0\n\u03a3+ =\n\n\u2212 12 (3\u03b3t\n\n\u2212 4)\n\n\u03a3\u2212 =\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n\u00b1 21\n\np\n\n0\n3(2 \u2212 \u03b3t )(3\u03b3t \u2212 2)\n0\n0\n0\n\n\u03a32+ + \u03a32\u2212 = 1\n\u03a3+ = \u22121 + A\n\n0\n\nA\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0 \u00b11\n1\n0\nA\n\nv\n0\n0\n0\n0\nv=\n\n3\u03b3t \u22124\n2(\u03b3t \u22121)\n\nv\nv\n1\n\u00b11\n\u00b11\n1\n\n\u03a9o\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\nRestrictions\n\n6\n5\n\n< \u03b3t < 2\n\n\u03b3t =\n\n4\n3\n\n0\n0\n0\n\nTABLE I.

TWO ORTHOGONAL FLUIDS\n\nSetting v = 0 in the constraint Eq. (2.12f), implies either A = 0, \u03a3+ 6= 0 (Bianchi type I models) or \u03a3+ = 0, A 6= 0\n(Bianchi type V models). Without loss of generality we can assume that \u03b3t > \u03b3o . The boundary subsets of the state\nspace for these two classes of models are given by the two invariant submanifolds \u03a9o = 0 and \u03a9n = 0, which describe\nthe corresponding one-fluid models. The dynamics of the Bianchi I state space is shown in Fig. 1, while the dynamics\nof the type V models is shown in Fig. 2.\nFor type I models there are two sources. The equilibrium point Ft0 gives rise to a single orbit ending at Fo0 . It\ncorresponds to a flat Friedmann model with two orthogonal fluids. The other source is the equilibrium set K 0 , of\nwhich each point is associated with a one-parameter set of orbits. Therefore this equilibrium set describes the generic\nbehavior at early times. The future attractor of these orbits is the point Fo0 . Thus, from Eqs. (A3) and (A9), all\northogonal two-fluid Bianchi type I models isotropize.\nFor type V models there are three sources. The equilibrium point Ft0 is associated with a one-parameter set of\norbits (characterized by \u03a3\u2212 = 0), which corresponds to open Friedmann models with two orthogonal fluids. They all\nend at the equilibrium point M 0 . The other two sources are the two equilibrium points belonging to the set K 0 with\n\u03a3\u2212 = \u00b11. Both of these are associated with two-parameter sets of orbits, and thus describe the generic early-time\nbehavior. They are future attracted to M 0 . Consequently, from Eqs. (A3) and (A9), all orthogonal two-fluid Bianchi\ntype V models isotropize.\nFrom the analysis of the orthogonal two-fluid models, it is clear that the generic behavior is described by equilibrium\npoints associated with two-parameter sets. Thus, in what follows, we will focus on such equilibrium points. Note that\nthe variable \u03c7 of Coley & Wainwright [8] (see App. B) is a monotone function when both the fluids are orthogonal.\nThis is no longer the case when one of the fluids is tilted.\n\nV. BIANCHI TYPE V LRS MODELS WITH ONE TILTED AND ONE ORTHOGONAL FLUID\n\nAs Bianchi type I models do not allow the combination of one non-tilted and one tilted fluid as a source due to\nthe constraint Eq. (2.12f), we focus on the Bianchi type V models. Since \u03a9o , \u03a9n > 0 imply q < 2 by Eq. (2.11),\nthe evolution equation for \u03a3\u2212 implies that \u03a3\u2212 is a monotone decreasing function along all orbits with \u03a3\u2212 \u2265 0 and\n\u03a9o , \u03a9n > 0. This fact significantly restricts the evolution at late times. It implies that lim\u03c4 \u2192\u221e \u03a3\u2212 = 0, for all\norbits with \u03a9o , \u03a9n > 0. This can be proven along the lines used to prove the similar statement for tilted single-fluid\nmodels, see [6]. The asymptotic behavior as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e is thus contained in the three-dimensional invariant set \u03a3\u2212 = 0\ncorresponding to the LRS models.\nThe three Kasner circles K 0 and K \u00b1 each reduce to two equilibrium points in the LRS submanifold, namely points\n+\n\u2212\n0\nfor which \u03a3+ = \u00b11. We denote these equilibrium points K\u00b1\n, K\u00b1\n, and K\u00b1\n, where the subscript distinguishes between\n\u00b1\n) are\nthe two signs of \u03a3+ . The equilibrium points for which v and \u03a3+ have the same sign (collectively denoted K\u00b1\nnot located on the boundary of the interior of the LRS submanifold. Consequently, we do not need to consider them\nwhen studying the dynamics.\nThe state space for the LRS submanifold with 2/3 < \u03b3o < \u03b3t < 2 is presented in Figs. 3\u20136. The effect of changing\nthe equation-of-state parameters so that \u03b3o > \u03b3t is that the flow along the orbit between Fo0 and Ft0 is reversed.\n6\n\n\f-\n\n+\n\nFo\n\nFo\n\nFo\n\n+\nFo\n\n0\n\nFo\n\n0\n\nFo\nM\n\nM\n\n+\n\nM\n\nH\n\n+\n\nM\n\nH\n\n-\n\n~\nM\nM\n\n+\n\nM\n\n+\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\nK+\n\n0\n\nFt\n\n-\n\n+\n\n-\n\n+\n\nFo\n\nFo\n\nFo\n\n0\n\n0\n\nFo\nM\n\n0\n\nK+\n\nFt\n\nFIG. 4.

Note that the special case \u03b3o = 0 corresponds to a cosmological constant. Consequently, the LRS state\nspace for 0 \u2264 \u03b3o < 2/3 is contained in Figs. 9\u201311 of [10]. Finally, if 0 \u2264 \u03b3t < 2/3 the flow changes along the orbits\n\u2212\n0\nFt0 \u2013M 0 and K+\n\u2013K+\n.\nThe sources and sinks for various equations of state are summarized in Table III. The isotropization properties,\nwhich can be found from Eqs. (A3) and (A6), are also listed. For \u03b3t < 6/5, all models isotropize. for \u03b3o > 2/3,\n6/5 < \u03b3t < 4/3 there is a class of solutions of non-zero measure that does not isotropize, namely the class of solutions\nassociated with M \u2212 . For \u03b3o > 2/3, \u03b3t = 4/3, all models isotropize. For \u03b3t > 4/3 no models isotropize. Note that\nthe physically interesting combination of one dust fluid and one radiation fluid always isotropizes, regardless of which\nfluid is tilted.\nWhen \u03b3o < 2/3, \u03b3t > 4/3, the future attractors are Fo\u00b1 . Solutions corresponding to orbits approaching these\nequilibrium points do not isotropize, see Table III, even though the final states are inflationary in the sense that the\ndeceleration parameter associated with the normal congruence q = 12 (3\u03b3o \u2212 2) is negative. Thus, in some sense it\nseems to be misleading to refer to solutions corresponding to orbits approaching these equilibrium points as \"asymptotically Friedmann models\", although the solutions corresponding to the points themselves are Friedmann models.\nIn particular, for the case of a cosmological constant \u03b3o = 0, the solutions corresponding to Fo\u00b1 are de Sitter models\n[10]. This is consistent with the cosmic \"no-hair\" theorem for Bianchi models [14]. However, the theorem does not\nguarantee that the tilt tends to zero, as pointed out by Raychaudhuri & Modak [15]. From our analysis, it is clear\nthat this cautionary note is crucial for these models. As the tilted fluid does not become orthogonal at late times,\nthe expansion-normalized shear of the tilted fluid does not vanish at late times. This stresses the point made in [10]\nthat one should be cautious about the isotropization of tilted models. As seen in Table III, this is in fact the generic\nbehavior for models with 0 \u2264 \u03b3o < 2/3 and \u03b3t \u2265 4/3.\nFor general irrotational Bianchi type V models, there is no a priori reason that \u03a3t\u2212 \u2192 0 when \u03a3t+ \u2192 0. However,\nthis is indeed the case for the equilibrium points in question, as can be seen from Eq. (A8), noting that \u03a3\u2212 \u2192 0.\nThus, the analysis of isotropization for the LRS submanifold holds for the general class of models as well.\nVI. DISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have continued the study of irrotational Bianchi type V cosmologies, using the dynamical systems\napproach initiated by Hewitt & Wainwright [6] and Coley & Wainwright [8].

Sources and sinks for the Bianchi type V LRS models with two fluids.\n\nwhere one of the fluids models the contribution of radiation to the energy density of the universe, and the other the\nmatter content.\nWe have found that, although the orthogonal two-fluid models isotropize, this is not necessarily the case when one\nof the fluids is tilted. Thus, depending on the equation-of-state parameters \u03b3o and \u03b3t , it is possible to find cases\nfor which all or a subset of the solutions are anisotropic to the future. In particular, there are models which are\ninflationary, but do not isotropize. However, we emphasize that the cases of dust plus radiation always isotropize.\nIt should be stressed that the relevant quantities when determining whether the shear dies away are shear quantities\nnormalized with respect to the expansion associated with each fluid.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank Claes Uggla for useful comments.
