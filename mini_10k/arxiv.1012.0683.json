Inspired by these experiments, there is an increasing interest to investigate the\nproperties of hadronic matter under extreme condition [1],[2]. In general, the media created\nby these collisions consist different mesons and baryons. Investigation of hadronic properties\nat finite temperature and density directly using the fundamental thermal QCD Lagrangian is\nhighly desirable. However, such interactions occur in a region very far from the perturbative\nregime, where the quark-gluon coupling constant becomes large and the perturbative methods is\nnot suitable for calculation of these properties. Therefore, we need nonperturbative approaches.\nSome nonperturbative approaches are Lattice QCD, Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET),\nQCD Sum Rules, etc. Among these approaches, the QCD Sum Rules method [3] and its extension to finite temperature [4] has been widely used as an efficient and applicable tool to\n1\n\n\finvestigate the hadronic properties [5]. The main elements in QCD sum rules approach are\ncorrelation function and dispersion relation. The correlation function is an object with dual\nnature. At large negative q 2 , it can be evaluated by perturbative methods, whereas at positive\nq 2 , it must be represented in terms of hadronic observables. Dispersion relation allows us to\nlink the thermal correlator for positive values of q 2 to the one for negative values. Spectral\nfunctions in different cases were studied in the literature [6]-[13].\nIn the present work, we investigate the two-point thermal correlator using the real time\nformulation of the thermal field theory [14]. We calculate the spectral densities of (pseudo)scalar\ncurrents at finite temperature, which are necessary for the phenomenological investigation of\n(pseudo)scalar mesons parameters. We use quark propagator at finite temperature and show\nhow an additional branch cut corresponding to particle absorption from the medium arises in\nspectral density. We also compare our results with predictions obtained at zero temperature.\n\n2\n\nThermal Spectral Densities of (Pseudo) Scalar Currents\n\nWe begin by considering the thermal correlation function,\n\u03a0(q, T ) = i\n\nZ\n\nD \u0010\n\nd4 xeiq*x T J(x)J + (0)\n\n\u0011E\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere J(x) =: q\u03041 (x)\u0393q2 (x) : is the interpolating current that carries the quantum numbers of\nthe state concerned and T indicates the time ordered product. Here \u0393 = I or i\u03b35 for scalar and\npseudoscalar particles, respectively. The thermal average of the operator, A = T (J(x)J + (0)),\nappearing in the above thermal correlator is expressed as\n\nhAi = T re\u2212\u03b2H A/T re\u2212\u03b2H ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere H is the QCD Hamiltonian, and \u03b2 = 1/T stands for the inverse of the temperature.\nTraces are carried out over any complete set of states. In the real time version, thermal\ncorrelator has the form of a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix. However, this matrix may be diagonalized, when\n\nit is expressed by a single analytic function, which determines completely the dynamics of the\ncorresponding two-point function [15]. As this function is simply related to any one, say the 11component of the matrix, we need to calculate only this component of the correlation function.\nThe 11-component of the thermal quark propagator is a sum of vacuum quark propagator\nexpression and a term depending on the Fermi distribution function,\nS(q) = (\u03b3 \u03bc q\u03bc + m)\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n1\n2\n2\n+\n2\u03c0in(|q\n|)\u03b4(q\n\u2212\nm\n)\n,\n0\nq 2 \u2212 m2 + i\u03b5\n\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere n(x) is the Fermi distribution function, n(x) = [exp(\u03b2x) + 1]\u22121 . Now, we proceed to\nobtain the temperature-dependent dispersion relation. The time ordering product in Eq. (1)\ncan be expressed as\nhT (J(x)J + (x\u2032 ))i = \u03b8(x0 \u2212 x\u20320 )hJ(x)J + (x\u2032 )i + \u03b8(x\u20320 \u2212 x0 )hJ + (x\u2032 )J(x)i,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b8(x) is step function.\nUsing Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation, hJ(x0 )J + (x\u20320 )i = hJ + (x\u20320 )J(x0 + i\u03b2)i for thermal\n\nexpectation and making Fourier and some other transformations, we get the following expression\nfor the thermal correlation function in momentum space [14]:\n1\n\u03a0(|q|, q0 ) =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndq0\u2032 M(|q|, q0\u2032 )\n\nwhere\nM(|q|, q0 ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b2q0 ) \u0011\n1\n,\n\u2212\nq0 \u2212 q0\u2032 + i\u03b5 q0 \u2212 q0\u2032 \u2212 i\u03b5\n\n(5)\n\nd4 xeiq*x hJ(x)J + (0)i.\n\n(6)\n\nIn the above transformations, the following standard integral representation for the \u03b8- step\nfunction is used:\n\n\u221e\nexp[ik0 (x0 \u2212 x\u20320 )]\n1\ndk0\n\u03b8(x0 \u2212\n=\n.\n(7)\n2i\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nk0 \u2212 i\u03b5\nThe imaginary part of the correlation function can be simply evaluated using the formula\n\nZ\n\nx\u20320 )\n\ni\nx+i\u03b5\n\n= \u03c0\u03b4(x) + iP ( x1 ), which leads to [16]:\n\u03a0(q, T ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nds\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03c1(q, T ) =\n\n1\nIm\u03a0(q, T ) tanh \u03b2q2 0\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c1(s)\n,\ns + Q20\n\n(8)\n\nand Q20 = \u2212q02 . In some cases, the correlation function\n\nhas ultraviolet divergent. If the spectral density does not vanish at s \u2192 \u221e, the dispersion\n\nintegral in Eq. (8) diverges. A standard way to overcome this problem is to subtract first\nfew terms of its Taylor expansion at q 2 = 0 from \u03a0(q, T ). The thermal correlation function in\nmomentum space can be written as\nd4 k\nT r(\u0393S(k)\u0393S(k \u2212 q)),\n(9)\n(2\u03c0)4\nwhere \u0393 = I and i\u03b35 for scalar and pseudoscalar particles, respectively. Inserting propagators\n\u03a0(q, T ) = \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nfrom Eq. (3) in Eq. (9) and carrying out the k0 integration, we obtain the imaginary part of\n\u03a0(q, T ) in the following form:\ndk 1 h 2\n(\u03c91 \u2212 k2 + k * q \u2212 \u03c91 q0 \u00b1 m1 m2 )\n2\n8\u03c0 \u03c91 \u03c92\n\u00d7[(1 \u2212 n1 \u2212 n2 + 2n1 n2 )\u03b4(q0 \u2212 \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 ) \u2212 (n1 + n2 \u2212 2n1 n2 )\u03b4(q0 \u2212 \u03c91 + \u03c92 )]\n\nIm\u03a0(q, T ) = \u2212Nc\n\nZ\n\n+(\u03c912 \u2212 k2 + k * q + \u03c91 q0 \u00b1 m1 m2 )\n\ni\n\n\u00d7[(1 \u2212 n1 \u2212 n2 + 2n1 n2 )\u03b4(q0 + \u03c91 + \u03c92 ) \u2212 (n1 + n2 \u2212 2n1 n2 )\u03b4(q0 + \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 )] ,\n3\n\n(10)\n\n\fwhere m1 and m2 are quark masses, \u03c91 =\n\nq\n\n2\n\nk +\n\nm21\n\n, \u03c92 =\n\nq\n\n(k-q)2 + m22 , n1 = n(\u03c91 ), n2 =\n\nn(\u03c92 ) and the plus and minus signs in front of m1 , m2 , correspond to scalar and pseudoscalar\nparticles, respectively. The term, which does not include the Fermi distribution functions, show\nthe vacuum contribution. Terms including the Fermi distributions depict medium contributions.\nThe delta-functions in the different terms of Eq. (10) control the regions of non-vanishing\nimaginary parts of \u03a0(q, T ) , which define the position of the branch cuts. As seen the term\nincluding \u03b4(q0 \u2212 \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 ) gives contribution when q0 = \u03c91 + \u03c92 . Using Cauchy-Schwarz\n\ninequality, (\n\nPn\n\ni=1\n\na2i )(\n\nPn\n\n2\ni=1 bi )\n\n\u03c91 \u03c92 =\n\n\u2265(\n\nq\n\nPn\n\ni=1\n\nai bi )2 we see that,\nq\n\nk2 + m21 (k-q)2 + m22 \u2265 |k||k-q| + m1 m2 ,\n\n(11)\n\nand for q0 = \u03c91 + \u03c92 , we get,\nq02 = m21 + k2 + m22 + (k-q)2 + 2\u03c91 \u03c92 \u2265 (m1 + m2 )2 + q2 .\n\n(12)\n\nTherefore, we obtain the first branch cut, q 2 \u2265 (m1 + m2 )2 , which coincides with zero tem-\n\nperature cut describing the standard threshold for particle decays. This term survives at zero\ntemperature and it is called the annihilation term. On the other hand, the term including\n\n\u03b4(q0 \u2212 \u03c91 + \u03c92 ) gives contribution when q0 = \u03c91 \u2212 \u03c92 . Similarly to the above expression, we\n\nobtain,\n\nq02 = m21 + k2 + m22 + (k-q)2 \u2212 2\u03c91 \u03c92 \u2264 (m1 \u2212 m2 )2 + q2 ,\n\n(13)\n\nand therefore an additional branch cut arises at finite temperature, q 2 \u2264 (m1 \u2212 m2 )2 , which\n\ncorresponds to particle absorption from the medium. It is called scattering term and vanishes\nat T = 0.\nIn the following, we restrict our calculations with |q| = 0, when there is no angular de-\n\npendence. Note that, with |q| = 0, the value of |k|, fixed by the \u03b4-functions in Eq. (10), is\nthe magnitude of three momentum of quark or antiquark in the center-of-mass of the quarkantiquark system:\nk2 =\n\n\u0010\n\nq02 \u2212 (m1 + m2 )2\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\nq02 \u2212 (m1 \u2212 m2 )2\n\n4q02\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nIn the |q| = 0 case, as it is seen, the terms including \u03b4(q0 \u2212\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92 ) and \u03b4(q0 +\u03c91 +\u03c92 ) functions\nin Eq. (10), give contributions at the regions, q0 \u2265 (m1 +m2 ) and q0 \u2264 \u2212(m1 +m2 ), respectively\n\ngiving the vacuum cuts. Similarly, the terms including \u03b4(q0 \u2212\u03c91 +\u03c92 ) and \u03b4(q0 +\u03c91 \u2212\u03c92 ) functions\n\nin Eq.

After straightforward calculations, we find the vacuum\n4\n\n\fpart of the Im\u03a0(q, T ) as:\n\u0011\n\u0010\nNc q 2\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\n2 2\n.\n(15)\nq\n\u2212\n(m\n\u2212\nm\n)\n(q\n\u2212\nm\n\u2212\nm\n)\n\u2212\n4m\nm\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n1 2 0\n8\u03c0q02\nTaking into account both branch cuts after some transformations, the annihilation and scat-\n\nIm\u03a0(q0 , T = 0) =\n\ntering parts of spectral density is found as:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0010 s\u0010\nh\n\u0010 s\u0010\nm21 \u2212 m22 \u0011\u0011\nm2 \u2212 m22 \u0011\u0011i\n1+\n\u2212n\n1\u2212 1\n,\n(16)\n\u03c1a,pert (s, T ) = \u03c10 (s) 1 \u2212 n\n2\ns\n2\ns\nfor (m1 + m2 )2 \u2264 s \u2264 \u221e,\n\u221a \u0010\n\u221a\nh \u0010 s\u0010\n\u0010\nm21 \u2212 m22 \u0011\u0011\nm2 \u2212 m22 \u0011\u0011i\ns\n\u03c1s,pert(s, T ) = \u03c10 (s) n\n1+\n\u2212n \u2212\n1\u2212 1\n,\n(17)\n2\ns\n2\ns\nfor 0 \u2264 s \u2264 (m1 \u2212 m2 )2 , with m1 \u2265 m2 . Here, \u03c10 (s) is the spectral density in the lowest order\nof perturbation theory at zero temperature and it is given by\n3\n\u03c10 (s) = 2 q 2 (s)v n (s),\n8\u03c0 s\n\u0010\n\nwhere q(s) = s \u2212 (m1 \u2212 m2 )2 and v(s) = 1 \u2212 4m1 m2 /q(s)\n\n\u00111/2\n\n(18)\n. Here n = 3 and n = 1 for\n\nscalar and pseudoscalar particles, respectively. As it is seen, at T \u2192 0 limit these expressions\n\nare in good consistency with the vacuum expressions. Moreover, the obtained results are well\nconsistent with the existing results in m1 = m2 case [17]-[19] for the scalar and pseudoscalar\nparticles.\nAs an example, we present the dependence of the annihilation and scattering parts of the\nspectral density for K \u00b1 and D \u00b1 particles in Figs. 1 and 2. In numerical analysis, we use the\nvalues ms = 0, 13 GeV and mc = 1, 46 GeV for the quark masses. As it is clear, in the region\nof the standard threshold for particle decays, the \u03c10 (s) is replaced by the annihilation term. In\nthe case of light mesons, the values of \u03c1a,pert (s, T ) considerably differ from those of the \u03c10 (s).\nHowever, in the case of heavy mesons, the \u03c1a,pert (s, T ) and \u03c10 (s) values are very close to each\nother. From Fig. 1, we also see that the in light K \u00b1 cases, the medium contributions play\nimportant role and consist higher percentage of the total value.\nOur concluding result is that the thermal contributions contribute significantly to the spectral function.\n\n3\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe authors would like to thank T.
