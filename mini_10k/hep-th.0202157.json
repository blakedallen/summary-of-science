Introduction\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence [1,2,3] relates a conformal field theory in (p + 1)dimensions to string theory in AdSp+2 \u00d7 X, where X is a compact Einstein space. In\nthe last few years, we have learned much about nonperturbative aspects of string theory\nand conformal field theories using this correspondence [4]. One of the major obstructions\nin making further progress in this direction has been our lack of understanding of the\nworldsheet dynamics describing string theory in AdS and related backgrounds. Understanding this problem is essential, for example, to finding quantitative results from string\ntheory for the large N limit of gauge theories with finite 't Hooft coupling. Although\nmuch progress has been made for string theory in AdS3 with an NS-NS background [5],\nworldsheet dynamics in higher dimensional AdS spaces and/or with R-R field strengths\nremains a mystery. Thus far, most of the results obtained from string theory in AdS have\nrelied on the supergravity approximation.\nRecently, it was shown in [6] that the worldsheet theory of the Type IIB string on the\nmaximally supersymmetric pp-wave geometry [7]:\n2\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nds = \u22124dx dx +\n\n8\nX\ni=1\n\n\u0001\ndr i dr i \u2212 r i r i dx+ dx+ ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwith constant R-R 5-form flux,\nF+1234 = F+5678 = const,\n\n(1.2)\n\nis exactly soluble in the light-cone Green-Schwarz formalism [8,9]. Moreover, in a recent\ninteresting paper [10], it was pointed out that Type IIB string theory on this pp-wave\nbackground is dual to the large N limit of a certain subsector of four dimensional N = 4\n\nSU (N ) supersymmetric gauge theory. The subsector is characterized by choosing a U (1)R\n\nsubgroup of the SU (4)R R-symmetry of the gauge theory and by considering states with\n\u221a\nconformal weight \u2206 and U (1)R charge R which scale as \u2206, R \u223c N and whose difference\n(\u2206\u2212R) is finite in the large N limit. The claim is that, in the N \u2192 \u221e limit with the string\n\ncoupling gs = gY2 M finite, the subspace of the gauge theory Hilbert space and the operator\n\nalgebra preserving these conditions are described by string theory in the pp-wave geometry.\nThis duality was derived in [10] by starting with the familiar correspondence between\nN = 4 SU (N ) supersymmetric gauge theory and Type IIB string theory in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5\n\nand considering a scaling limit of the geometry near a null geodesic in AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 carrying\n2\n\n\flarge angular momentum with respect to the U (1)R isometry of S 5 . This corresponds\nto truncating to the appropriate subsector of the gauge theory in the scaling limit. The\nstring theory background that one obtains in the scaling limit is the pp-wave geometry\nwith a constant R-R flux which can then be quantized in the light-cone gauge [6]. The\nscaling limit is a special example of the Penrose limit which transforms any solution of\nsupergravity to a plane wave geometry [11,12,13,14].\nIn [10], it was shown that operators in the appropriate subsector of N = 4 SU (N )\n\ngauge theory can be identified with stringy oscillators in the pp-wave background. This\nmatching makes quantitative predictions about the spectrum of the gauge theory beyond\nthe supergravity approximation, and some of them were checked in [10] using gauge theory\ncomputation of planar Feynman diagrams.\nIn this paper we consider a similar duality that exists between a certain fourdimensional N = 1 gauge theory and Type IIB string theory in a pp-wave background.\n\nWe derive this duality by taking a scaling limit of the duality [15] between Type IIB\nstring theory on AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 and the four-dimensional superconformal field theory which\nconsists of an N = 1 SU (N ) \u00d7 SU (N ) super Yang-Mills multiplet with a pair of bifunda-\n\nmental chiral multiplets Ai and Bi transforming in the (N, N\u0304 ) and (N\u0304 , N ) representation\nof the gauge group. The gauge theory is flown to the IR fixed point and deformed by an\nSU (2)1 \u00d7 SU (2)2 invariant superpotential\nW =\n\n\u03bb ij i\u2032 j \u2032\n\u01eb \u01eb TrAi Bi\u2032 Aj Bj \u2032 ,\n2\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhich is exactly marginal at the fixed point. This gives the theory of [15] that lives1 on\nN D3-branes sitting at the conifold singularity of a Calabi-Yau three-fold. The scaling\nlimit is obtained by considering the geometry near a null geodesic carrying large angular\nmomentum in the U (1)R isometry of the T 1,1 space which is dual to the U (1)R R-symmetry\nin the N = 1 superconformal field theory.\n\nThe scaling limit around this null geodesic in AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 results in a pp-wave geome-\n\ntry. We identify the light-cone Hamiltonian, longitudinal momentum and angular momen-\n\ntum of string theory in the pp-wave geometry with linear combinations of the conformal\nweight \u2206, U (1)R charge R and U (1)1 \u00d7 U (1)2 global charges Q1 and Q2 of operators in\nthe dual N = 1 gauge theory. The appropriate scaling limit requires truncating the gauge\n1\n\nThe details of the gauge theory will appear in section 3.\n\n3\n\n\ftheory Hilbert space to those operators whose conformal weight \u2206, R-charge R and global\ncharges Q1 and Q2 scaling like\n\u2206, R, Q1 , Q2 \u223c\nwith\n\n\u221a\n\nN,\n\n1\n1\n3\n\u2206 \u2212 R, Q1 \u2212 R, and Q2 \u2212 R : finite,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(1.4)\n\n(1.5)\n\nin the large N limit.\nRemarkably, the pp-wave geometry that one obtains in the scaling limit can be transformed into the maximally supersymmetric background of (1.1) and (1.2) after a suitable\nchange of coordinates. Therefore, in this limit supersymmetry is enhanced. This implies\nthat the subsector of the Hilbert space of the N = 1 gauge theory of [15] obeying the\n\nconditions (1.4) and (1.5) has a hidden N = 4 supersymmetry. We believe that this is a\nvery interesting prediction of our duality that deserves further study.\n\nWe find that the change of coordinates induces twisting of the light-cone Hamiltonian\nof the string theory by\np\u2212 = p\u2212\nS 5 + J1 + J2 ,\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhere p\u2212\nS 5 is the Hamiltonian of the maximally supersymmetric wave found in [6] and J1 ,\nJ2 correspond to rotation charges under an R2 \u00d7 R2 subspace of the transverse space of\n\nthe pp-wave geometry. From the gauge theory point of view, the light-cone Hamiltonian\np\u2212 before the twisting is \u2206 \u2212 23 R and the rotational charges are given by Ja = Qa \u2212 21 R\n\n(a = 1, 2). Note that they remain finite in the limit (1.5). After the twisting, the light-cone\nHamiltonian is identified with \u2206N =4 \u2212 RN =4 , in terms of the conformal weight and the R\n\ncharge for the N = 4 supersymmetry algebra. Thus we find the following relation\n3\n\u2206N =4 \u2212 RN =4 = \u2206 \u2212 R \u2212 J1 \u2212 J2\n2\n1\n= \u2206 \u2212 R \u2212 Q1 \u2212 Q2 .\n2\n\n(1.7)\n\nThe spectrum of stringy excitations in the N = 4 theory studied in [10] can then be\n\nturned into that of the N = 1 theory by this twisting. The twisted string spectrum is\nhighly degenerate, and we show that it matches with gauge theory expectations.\n\nThe Penrose limit focuses on geometry near a null geodesic. When we have a gauge\ntheory whose supersymmetry is reduced by placing branes on a curved space, the Penrose\nlimit may flatten out the space and restore supersymmetry. We have found other examples\n4\n\n\fwhere similar enhancement of symmetry takes place. Those include the N = 1 pure super\n\nYang-Mills theory (with Kaluza-Klein tower of fields) studied in [16] and gauge theories\nrealized on branes on a C 3 /Z3 orbifold singularity. The limit of the former is a variation\n\nof the Nappi-Witten geometry [17] with 16 supercharges, and that of the latter is the\nmaximally supersymmetric pp-wave. On the other hand, there are cases in which such\nenhancement does not happen, such as gauge theories on branes at a C 2 /Z2 orbifold\nsingularity.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we consider the scaling limit\naround a null geodesic in AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 and show that one obtains a pp-wave background.\n\nWe identify the subsector of the Hilbert space of the dual superconformal field theory\nthat is dual to string theory in the pp-wave geometry. We show that there is a coordinate transformation which brings the pp-wave background to the one which has maximal\nsupersymmetry (1.1). The Hamiltonian of the pp-wave is then obtained by twisting the\nHamiltonian of the Type IIB string in that background by angular momentum charges J1\nand J2 that the strings carry in the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background. In\nsection 3, we describe ingredients of the N = 1 theory of [15] that are required to compare the gauge theory and the string theory. Precise matching is obtained by identifying\n\nin a specific way string theory excitations with gauge theory operators. In section 4, we\ndiscuss other examples in which similar enhancement of symmetry takes place and show\nan example where symmetry enhancement does not occur. We conclude with a discussion.\nIn the appendix we explicitly solve for the worldsheet theory of the pp-wave background\nthat we obtain in the limit. Explicit diagonalization of the Hamiltonian shows that it is\nrelated to that of the maximally supersymmetric wave by twisting.\nNote added:\nAfter posting this paper on the e-Print arXiv, we have received [18,19], where the\nPenrose limit of AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 is studied and the supersymmetry enhancement is also noted.\nWe also received [20], where the Penrose limit of backgrounds with NS-NS 3 form field and\nits relation to a generalization of the Nappi-Witten model are also discussed.\n\n2. Penrose limit of AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1\nWe start by considering the supergravity solution dual to the N = 1 superconformal\n\nfield theory of [15] that we describe in the next section.

The SU (2)1 \u00d7 SU (2)2 \u00d7 U (1)R isometry group of T 1,1 is identified with\n\nthe SU (2)1 \u00d7 SU (2)2 global symmetry and U (1)R symmetry of the dual superconformal\n\nfield theory of [15].

The geometry is supported by a null,\n\ncovariantly constant flux of the R-R field,\n\nF+1234 = F+5678 = const.\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe obvious symmetries of this background are the SO(4) rotations in R4 and a U (1)\u00d7U (1)\nsymmetry3 rotating R2 \u00d7 R2 . In the gauge theory side, the SO(4) symmetry corresponds\n\nto the subgroup of the SO(2, 4) conformal symmetry (i.e. the rotations of S 3 in the field\ntheory space R \u00d7 S 3 ) and the U (1) \u00d7 U (1) rotation charges J1 and J2 with the U (1) \u00d7 U (1)\nsymmetry Q1 \u2212 12 R and Q2 \u2212 12 R respectively, where R is the U (1)R charge of the gauge\n\ntheory and Q1 , Q2 are the Cartan generators of the SU (2)1 \u00d7 SU (2)2 global symmetry of\nthe dual superconformal field theory.\n\nIn order to compare string theory in the pp-wave geometry (2.5) with the appropriate\nsubsector of the dual field theory determined by the limit, (2.3) and (2.4), we need to\nestablish the correspondence between conserved charges in string theory and in gauge\ntheory. In string theory, the light-cone momenta can be identified with combinations of\nthe conformal weight \u2206 and the U (1)R charge R of the dual superconformal field theory\nby noting that4\n3\n2p\u2212 = i\u2202x+ = i(\u2202t + 3\u2202\u03c8 ) = \u2206 \u2212 R\n2 \u0012\n\u0013\n1\n3\ni\ni\n+\n2p = 2 \u2202x\u2212 = 2 (\u2202t \u2212 3\u2202\u03c8 ) = 2 \u2206 + R .\nL\nL\nL\n2\n\n(2.7)\n\n3\n\nIn fact, the metric and the flux is invariant under a larger symmetry as we shall see below.\n\n4\n\nThe factor of two in the normalization of R is due to the 4\u03c0 periodicity of the \u03c8 coordinate.\n\n7\n\n\fThe J1 and J2 rotation charges of the string can be identified with\nJa = \u2212i\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c6a\n\nx\u00b1\n\n= \u2212i\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c6a\n\n+i\nt,\u03c8\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c8\n\nt,\u03c6i\n\n1\n= Qa \u2212 R\n2\n\na = 1, 2\n\n(2.8)\n\nsuch that the states of the dual gauge theory are also labeled by these global symmetry\ncharges.\nTherefore, it follows from the identification (2.7) and the L \u2192 \u221e limit, (2.3) and (2.4),\n\nthat string theory in the pp-wave background (2.5) with finite p\u2212 , p+ and Ji is dual to the\n\u221a\nN = 1 gauge theory of [15] in a subsector of the Hilbert space where \u2206, R, Qa \u223c L2 \u223c N\nwith finite (\u2206\u2212 23 R) and Qa \u2212 21 R in the large N limit. In particular the duality with string\n\ntheory predicts that there is a set of non-chiral primary operators, which satisfy \u2206 > 32 R,\nwhose dimension and R-charge grow without bound but such that the deviation from the\nBPS bound is finite in the large N limit. In the next section we will make a proposal for\nwhich operators of the gauge theory obey this peculiar scaling behavior.\nRemarkably, the pp-wave geometry (2.5) that we have obtained in the scaling limit\nreduces to the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave solution (1.1) after performing a coordinate dependent U (1) \u00d7 U (1) rotation in the R2 \u00d7 R2 plane as\n+\n\nza = eix wa\n+\n\nz\u0304a = e\u2212ix w\u0304a .\n\n(2.9)\n\nThis means that the symmetry and supersymmetry of the original AdS5 \u00d7T 1,1 background\n\nis maximally enhanced in the Penrose limit, (2.3) and (2.4). We interpret this as saying\nthat the corresponding subsector of the dual N = 1 superconformal field theory has hidden\nN = 4 supersymmetry.\n\nThe coordinate transformation (2.9) mapping the solution (2.5) to the maximally\n\nsupersymmetric solution (1.1) allows us to write down the string Hamiltonian p\u2212 in (2.7)\nin terms of the Hamiltonian p\u2212\nS 5 of the maximally symmetric solution already computed in\n[6]. Using the coordinate transformation (2.9) and the relation (2.7) between the isometry\nand the gauge theory charges, we find that\n3\n\u2206 \u2212 R = 2p\u2212\n2\n\u2202\n=i +\n\u2202x\n\u2202\n=i +\n\u2202x\n\nza\n\nwa\n\n\u0013\nX\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\nwa\n\u2212 w\u0304a\n\u2202wa\n\u2202 w\u0304a\na\n\n= 2p\u2212\nS 5 + J1 + J2 ,\n8\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fwhere J1 and J2 are the U(1) rotation charges around an R2 \u00d7R2 subspace of the maximally\nsupersymmetric pp-wave R8 transverse space5 , and\n\n2p\u2212\nS 5 = \u2206N =4 \u2212 RN =4 .\n\n(2.11)\n\nWe now briefly recall the string spectrum p\u2212\nS 5 found in [6]. The spectrum consists of\na set of eight bosonic harmonic oscillators ain and eight fermionic harmonic oscillators Sn\u03b1\nwith i, \u03b1 = 1, 2, . . . 8. The increase in light-cone energy due to one oscillator is given by\ns\n\u00132\n\u0012\nn\n\u2212\n2\u03b4pS 5 = 1 +\n,\n(2.12)\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\n\nso that in particular the zero modes ai0 and S0a increase p\u2212\nS 5 by one. To obtain the spectrum\n\nof p\u2212 we use the twisting formula (2.10). In order to find the spectrum we need to know\nthe charges of ain and Sn\u03b1 under the U (1) \u00d7 U (1) subgroup of the SO(8) rotation group.\n\nThe charges of the bosonic oscillators follow from decomposing the bosonic oscillators,\n\nwhich transform under the 8v representation of the SO(8) rotation group under SU (2) \u00d7\n\nSU (2) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 U (1), such that the R8 space on which SO(8) acts splits as R4 \u00d7 R2 \u00d7 R2 ,\n\nand U (1) \u00d7 U (1) rotates R2 \u00d7 R2 . We organize the oscillators as\nain\n\nJ1 = J2 = 0\n\nwn1\n\nJ1 = 1, J2 = 0\n\nw\u0304n1\n\nJ1 = \u22121, J2 = 0\n\nwn2\n\nJ1 = 0, J2 = 1\n\nw\u0304n2\n\nJ1 = 0, J2 = \u22121.\n\ni = 1, 2, 3, 4\n\nTherefore, the contribution to p\u2212 of each of the bosonic oscillators is\ns\n\u00132\n\u0012\nn\ni\n\u2212\nan\n2\u03b4p = 1 +\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\ns\n\u0012\n\u00132\nn\n1\n\u2212\nwn\n2\u03b4p = 1 +\n+1\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\ns\n\u00132\n\u0012\nn\n1\n\u2212\n\u22121\nw\u0304n\n2\u03b4p = 1 +\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\ns\n\u0012\n\u00132\nn\n2\n\u2212\nwn\n2\u03b4p = 1 +\n+1\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\ns\n\u00132\n\u0012\nn\n2\n\u2212\n\u2212 1.\nw\u0304n\n2\u03b4p = 1 +\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\n5\n\n(2.13)\n\n(2.14)\n\nThe U (1) \u00d7 U (1) rotation charges when changing from z to w coordinates remain identical.\n\n9\n\n\fThe fermionic oscillator contribution to p\u2212 follows by looking at the U (1) \u00d7 U (1) charges\n\ncarried by the SO(8) spinor 8s under SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 U (1). The oscillators split\n\nas\n\n8s \u2192 (2, 1)(1/2,1/2) \u2295 (2, 1)(\u22121/2,\u22121/2) \u2295 (1, 2)(1/2,\u22121/2) \u2295 (1, 2)(\u22121/2,1/2),\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere the charges in the subscript correspond to (J1 , J2 ) charges. Therefore, their contribution to the light-cone Hamiltonian (2.10) is\ns\nSn\u03b1++\n\nSn\u03b1\u2212\u2212\nSn\u03b1\u0307+\u2212\nSn\u03b1\u0307\u2212+\n\n\u2212\n\n1+\n\n2\u03b4p =\n\u2212\n\n2\u03b4p =\n\ns\n\n2\u03b4p\u2212 =\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n\ns\n\n2\u03b4p =\n\n1+\n1+\n1+\n\n\u0012\n\nn\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\n\n\u00132\n\n+1\n\n\u0012\n\nn\n\u2032\n\u03b1 p+\n\n\u00132\n\n\u22121\n\nn\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\n\n\u00132\n\n\u0012\n\nn\n\u2032\n\u03b1 p+\n\n\u00132\n\n(2.16)\n\n.\n\nThus we see that the spectrum of bosonic oscillators and fermionic oscillators are identical.\nWe note that the light-cone energy is not increased by the action of the bosonic\nzero mode oscillators w\u030401 and w\u030402 nor by the action of their supersymmetric fermionic\nzero mode partners S0\u03b1\u2212\u2212 . Therefore, the system has an infinitely degenerate spectrum\nlabeled by the number of times the vacuum state is acted on by the zero modes. In the\noriginal coordinates of the pp-wave in (2.5), the degeneracy of the spectrum can be easily\nunderstood by considering the zero-mode sector (i.e., the point particle limit) of string\ntheory. In the zero mode sector, the Hamiltonian contains, on top of four free harmonic\noscillators, two decoupled Landau Hamiltonians describing an electron in a magnetic field\nin the planes z1 and z2 . The degeneracy in these coordinates corresponds to the well known\nLandau level degeneracy of states of the electron where the degeneracy is labeled by the\nangular momentum of the electron. In the appendix, we extend this to stringy excitations,\nquantizing the bosonic string Hamiltonian in these coordinates. We show that indeed the\nspectrum is twisted by (J1 +J2 ) as in (2.14) with respect to the maximally supersymmetric\ncase of [6].\nIn the next section we give a precise prescription of how to realize the infinite degeneracy of states in string theory, which corresponds in the dual superconformal field theory to\nhaving an infinite degeneracy of operators with a given conformal dimension, and identify\nthe operators dual to the insertion of the string theory oscillators.\n10\n\n\f3. Gauge theory spectrum\nType IIB superstring theory in AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 is dual to the N = 1 gauge theory with\n\ngauge group SU (N ) \u00d7 SU (N ) with two chiral multiplets Ai (i = 1, 2) transforming in the\n\n(N, N\u0304 ) representation of the gauge group and two chiral multiplets Bi\u2032 (i\u2032 = 1, 2) in the\n\n(N\u0304 , N ) representation. The theory is flown to the IR fixed point. We then turn on the\nsuperpotential (1.3) involving the chiral superfields Ai and Bi\u2032 . At the fixed point, these\nchiral superfields have conformal weight 3/4 and R-charge 1/2. They transform as (2, 1)\nand (1, 2) under the SU (2)1 \u00d7 SU (2)2 global symmetry.\n\nNow we are ready to compare states in the string theory with operators in the gauge\n\ntheory. We will mainly focus only on the bosonic excitations of the theory, denoted by\nwna and w\u0304na in (2.14). Let us begin with the zero mode sector of string theory, which is\ngenerated by w\u030401 and w\u030402 . Since we are dealing with the zero mode of the string, they are\nsupergravity modes in AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 . The correspondence between supergravity modes and\ngauge theory operators has been discussed extensively in [21,22]. It is useful to rephrase\n\nit in the stringy terminology of the last section. We will find some special feature of the\nsupergravity spectrum in the Penrose limit. Since the light-cone Hamiltonian 2p\u2212 is equal\nto (\u2206 \u2212 23 R), the lowest energy states of the string theory are chiral primary states. The\n\nbasic ones are of the form Tr(AB)R . Among them, we can identity the ground state |0i of\n\nthe w\u03040a oscillators with the gauge theory operator,\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n|0i \u2194 Tr (A1 B1 )R .\n\n(3.1)\n\nHere and in the following, we ignore normalization factors in gauge theory operators which\nmay depend on N and R. We have chosen Ai and Bi\u2032 so that A1 and A2 carries Q1 charge\n+ 12 and \u2212 12 and B1 and B2 carries Q2 charge + 21 and \u2212 12 respectively. Their (J1 , J2 )\n\ncharges defined by Ja = Qa \u2212 21 R are therefore ( 41 , \u2212 14 ) and (\u2212 43 , \u2212 14 ) for A1 and A2 , and\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(\u2212 14 , 14 ) and (\u2212 41 , \u2212 43 ) for B1 and B2 . Thus the operator Tr (A1 B1 )R in (3.1) carries\nJ1 = J2 = 0, and \u2206 \u2212 23 R = \u2206N =4 \u2212 RN =4 = 0. Namely it saturates the BPS bounds for\n\nboth N = 1 and N = 4 supersymmetry algebras.\nThe operators w\u03040a then act on it as\n\nw\u030401 : A1 \u2192 A2 , w\u030402 : B1 \u2192 B2 .\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn order for these to map the chiral primary state (3.1) into another chiral primary state,\ntheir action has to be symmetrized along all A1 's and B1 's in the trace [15]. Since the w\u03040a\n11\n\n\foscillators are absent in the worldsheet Hamiltonian, their action does not increase 2p\u2212 =\n\u2206 \u2212 32 R. This is consistent with the fact that the action of the w\u03040a 's in the gauge theory\n\ngives rise to chiral primary states saturating the BPS bound of the N = 1 supersymmetry.\n\nOn the other hand, \u2206N =4 \u2212 RN =4 = \u2206 \u2212 32 R \u2212 J1 \u2212 J2 is increased by 1 every time we act\nwith w\u03040 since J1 + J2 = 0 for A1 and B1 while it is \u22121 for A2 and B2 . Note that (J1 + J2 )\n\nis not positive for any of the operators. Therefore these operators satisfy the BPS bounds\n\nfor both the N = 1 and the N = 4 supersymmetry algebras. This gives an important\nconsistency check of our conjecture about the supersymmetry enhancement.\n\nFrom the way they act on Ai and Bi\u2032 , it is clear that w\u030401 , w\u030402 and their conjugates are\nidentified as the raising and lowering operators of the SU (2)1 \u00d7SU (2)2 global symmetry of\n\nthe gauge theory. On the string worldsheet, they act as harmonic oscillators. On the other\n\u0002\n\u0003\nhand, when acting on the gauge theory operators Tr (A1 B1 )R , they obey the constraints\n(w\u030401 )R+1 = 0, (w\u030402 )R+1 = 0. This does not contradict with the correspondence between\n\nstring theory and gauge theory. Since Ja = Qa \u2212 21 R (a = 1, 2) has to remain finite in the\n\nlimit R \u2192 \u221e, only a finite number of w\u03040 's can act on this operator and these constraints\n\nbecome irrelevant.\n\nThe oscillators w0a 's in (2.14) are more interesting. They change (\u2206 \u2212 32 R) by 2,\n\nthus their action does not generate chiral primary states. Nevertheless the resulting states\n\nshould be in the supergravity sector. Candidates for such states can be found in the list\nof operators given in [22], where they are called semi-conserved superfields. Although\nthey are not chiral primaries, their conformal dimensions are protected. The ones we are\ninterested in here take the following form,\nTr\n\nh\n\nAeV \u0100e\u2212V\n\n\u0001n1\n\neV B\u0304e\u2212V B\n\n\u0001n2\n\ni\n(AB)R ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere V is the vector multiplet for the gauge group SU (N ) \u00d7 SU (N ). There is one\n\nimportant subtlety in making the identification. It was pointed out in [21] that, in order for\nthe corresponding supergravity mode to have a rational conformal dimension, the integers\nn1 and n2 must satisfy the Diophantine equation,\nn21 + n22 \u2212 4n1 n2 \u2212 n1 \u2212 n2 = 0.\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis is true if we are studying states with finite \u2206 and R. Since we are studying the\n\u221a\nscaling limit \u2206, R \u223c N \u2192 \u221e, it is worth revisiting its origin. The constraint comes from\n12\n\n\fthe fact that the eigenvalue E of the Laplacian on T 1,1 for the corresponding supergravity\nmode takes the form\nE=\n\n6n21\n\n+\n\n6n22\n\n3\n+ 8n1 n2 + (6R + 8)(n1 + n2 ) + R\n2\n\nOne can then show that the conformal weight \u2206 = \u22122 +\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n3\nR+4 .\n2\n\n(3.5)\n\n4 + E of the mode becomes\n\nrational if (3.4) is satisfied. However, this condition is relaxed in the limit R \u2192 \u221e. In this\nlimit, the meaningful quantity is (\u2206 \u2212 23 R), and it is given by\n3\n\u2206 \u2212 R = 2n1 + 2n2 + O\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nR\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe right-hand side of this equation is clearly rational. In fact, they are even integers.\nTherefore the Diophantine constraint (3.4) is irrelevant in the subsector of the Hilbert\nspace we are looking. Moreover the formula is exactly what we need to identify the action\nof w0a . Since each of these operators is supposed to increase 2p\u2212 = \u2206 \u2212 23 R by 2 and they\ncarry the U (1) \u00d7 U (1) quantum numbers (\u22121, 0) and (0, \u22121), the natural identification is\nw01 : insertion of A1 eV \u01002 e\u2212V , w02 : insertion of eV B\u03042 e\u2212V B1 .\n\n(3.7)\n\nOf course the insertion must be symmetrized along the trace so that (\u2206\u2212 23 R) is minimized.\nAs we discussed in the last section, string theory in AdS5 \u00d7 T 1,1 acquires enhanced\n\nN = 4 superconformal symmetry in the Penrose limit. This means that the spectrum of\nthe gauge theory operators in this subsector must fall into N = 4 multiplets. Since the\n\noscillators w0a and w\u03040a are part of the N = 4 superconformal generators (P I and J +I in\n\nthe notation of [6], see also [23]), we conjecture that the chiral primary fields of the form\nTr(AB)R and the semi-conserved multiplets of the form (3.3) combine to make N = 4\n\nmultiplets in the limit.6 Note that this can happen only in the limit. For finite R, the\n\nsemi-conserved multiplets have to obey the Diophantine constraint (3.4) in order for them\nto have rational conformal weights.\n6\n\nThe decomposition of N = 4 chiral multiplets into N = 1 multiplets has been discussed in\n\n[24], whose results should be useful in proving this conjecture. There, the R-symmetry acting\non N = 1 multiplets is chosen to be the commutant of SU (3) in the SU (4) R-symmetry of the\nN = 4 theory. On the other hand, the R-symmetry of the N = 1 theory of [15] is the commutant\nof SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) in the SU (4) R-symmetry of the enhanced N = 4 supersymmetry.\n\n13\n\n\fNow let us turn to the stringy excitations. The string-bit interpretation suggests that\na worldsheet operator with non-zero Fourier mode n acts on a gauge theory operator just as\nits n = 0 counter-part, but the action is summed over the trace with a position dependent\nphase proportional to n. This point of view was adopted in [10] to identify operators in\nin the N = 4 gauge theory corresponding to stringy excitations. We extend their proposal\nto the N = 1 theory we are studying.\n\nConsider the oscillators w\u0304na . When n = 0, it is defined as the replacement A1 \u2192 A2\n\nfor a = 1 and B1 \u2192 B2 for a = 2, averaged over the trace. It is then natural to identify\nw\u0304n1 |0i\n\n\u2194\n\nw\u0304n2 |0i \u2194\n\nR\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\nR\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 2\u03c0ink\nTr (A1 B1 )k A2 B1 (A1 B1 )R\u22121\u2212k e R\n\n(3.8)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 2\u03c0ink\nTr (A1 B1 )k A1 B2 (A1 B1 )R\u22121\u2212k e R .\n\nOf course, the operators on the right-hand side vanish due to the cyclicity of the trace.\nThis corresponds to the string theory fact that the left-hand side does not satisfy the level\nmatching momentum constraint, as explained in [10]. The idea is to use an analogous\nP\nP\n2\n2\ndefinition for w\u0304n1 1 * * * w\u0304n1 s w\u0304m\n*\n*\n*\nw\u0304\n|0i\nsuch\nthat\nn\n+\nmi\u2032 = 0.

As pointed out in [15], these operators\nvanish if we use the constraint due to the superpotential (1.3),\nA1 Bi\u2032 A2 = A2 Bi\u2032 A1 ,\n\nB 1 Ai B 2 = B 2 Ai B 1 .\n\n(3.10)\n\nSince they are defined against the potential wall, they gain additional conformal weights\nbeyond their naive values, and therefore \u2206 \u2212 23 R > 0. The string theory computation in\n\nsection 3 predicts that the action of w\u0304n changes (\u2206 \u2212 32 R) by\n\ns\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0013\nn\n3\n\u03b4 \u2206\u2212 R\n= 1+\n\u22121\n2\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\nn\nr\nN\n= 1 + 3\u03c0gs n2 2 \u2212 1.\nR\n\n(3.11)\n\nWe are taking the large N limit so that N/R2 remains finite. When gs > 0, the\nright-hand side is indeed strictly positive. One of the interesting features of this formula is\n14\n\n\fthat \u03b4(\u2206 \u2212 23 R)n vanishes at gs = 0 even for n 6= 0, giving rise to further degeneracy of the\n\nspectrum. In the large N limit, the only parameter of the string theory is gs while that of\nthe gauge theory is \u03bb, the coefficient of the superpotential. Since the superpotential must\nincrease the conformal weights of these operators, one explanation of what happens at\ngs = 0 is that \u03bb vanishes in the gauge theory side. To our knowledge, a map between these\nparameters has not been worked out, and this observation may give us some hint about the\ncorrespondence between the gauge theory moduli and the string theory moduli. At gs = 0,\nthe string theory Hilbert space becomes the Fock space of first quantized strings, whose\nspectrum is integral. It would be interesting to see whether such a structure emerges in\nthis subsector of the gauge theory at \u03bb = 0.\nThe other set of operators wna are similarly interpreted in the gauge theory side. These\noperators insert AeV \u0100e\u2212V and eV B\u0304e\u2212V B in the trace and sum over insertion points along\nthe trace with position dependent phases. The string theory computation predicts that\nthe amount of change of (\u2206 \u2212 23 R) is given by\ns\n\u00132\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n3\nn\n= 1+\n+1\n\u03b4 \u2206\u2212 R\n2\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\nn\nr\nN\n= 1 + 3\u03c0gs n2 2 + 1.\nR\n\n(3.12)\n\nOne can also consider operators corresponding to stringy excitations in the r i directions. In [10], these are interpreted as taking derivative of operators with respect to spatial\ncoordinates in the gauge theory. In our case, one may be puzzled by the fact that there\nseem to be two types of derivatives, those acting on A's and those acting on B's. Clearly\nonly particular combinations of them correspond to stringy excitations of the r i directions.\nIn general, there are many gauge invariant observables one can write down, and only some\nof them correspond to string states. We expect that the others become infinitely heavy,\ni.e. (\u2206 \u2212 23 R) becomes infinitely large, in the large N limit.\n\n4. Other examples\nThe Penrose limit focuses on the geometry near a null geodesic. When we have a\ngauge theory whose supersymmetry is reduced by placing branes on a curved space, the\nPenrose limit may flatten out the space near the branes and restore supersymmetry. Thus\n15\n\n\fwe expect that enhancement of symmetry takes place in a large class of theories which\nhave gravity duals.\nLet us consider the supergravity solution found in [16] which is dual to pure N = 1\n\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (with Kaluza-Klein tower of fields). We will show that\nit has a Penrose limit which is identical to that of a collection of five-branes in flat space.\n\nThus, in this case, symmetry is again enhanced in the corresponding subsector of N = 1\nsuper Yang-Mills. To exhibit this we write the metric of NS-NS five-branes in flat space\n2\n\n2\n\nds = ds (R\n\n1,5\n\n)+L\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1\n1 2 1\n2\n2\n2\nd\u03c1 + (d\u03c8 + cos \u03b8 d\u03c6) + d\u03b8 + sin \u03b8 d\u03c6 ,\n4\n4\n4\n2\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere L2 = \u03b1\u2032 N . We introduce the following null coordinates\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 t\n1\nx =\n+ (\u03c8 + \u03c6)\n2 L 2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nL2 t\n\u2212\n\u2212 (\u03c8 + \u03c6)\nx =\n2 L 2\n+\n\n(4.2)\n\nand consider the limit around \u03c1 = \u03b8 = 0. We take the limit L \u2192 \u221e while rescaling the\ncoordinates\n\n\u03c1=\n\nr\nL\n\n\u03b8=\n\n2y\n.\nL\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe metric that one obtains in this limit is\nds2 = \u22124dx+ dx\u2212 \u2212 2y 2 d\u03c6dx+ + ds2 (R8 ),\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhich by using the coordinate transformation in (2.9) reduces to the pp-wave metric\nds2 = \u22124dx+ dx\u2212 \u2212 ww\u0304dx+ dx+ + dwdw\u0304 + ds2 (R6 ),\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere w is a complex coordinate on an R2 plane in R8 . Moreover, in the limit (4.4)\nthe dilaton becomes constant and the NS-NS three-form flux H+12 = const becomes null.\nThe worldsheet theory describing the coordinates (x+ , x\u2212 , w, w\u0304) can be identified with the\nWZW model based on the non-semi-simple group which is the central extension of the\ntwo-dimensional Poincare group, found by Nappi and Witten [17].\nOne can also show that the Penrose limit of the Maldacena-Nu\u00f1ez solution [16] in\nthe region near \u03c1 = 0 gives rise to a generalization of the Nappi-Witten geometry with\n16\n\n\f16 supercharges and again the supersymmetry is enhanced.7 It would be interesting to\nexplore the consequences of this symmetry enhancement for the gauge theory.\nAnother interesting example is to consider the Penrose limit of the dual pair obtained\nby placing N D3-branes at a C 3 /Z3 orbifold singularity. The gauge theory living on the\nD3-branes is an N = 1 four-dimensional quiver gauge theory [25] and the gravity dual is\n\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 /Z3 [26], where the S 5 is described by the complex coordinates zi (i = 1, 2, 3)\n\nconstrained by\n\n|z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 = 1\n\n(4.6)\n\nand the Z3 generator g acts by\ng * zi = \u03b1zi\n\n\u03b13 = 1,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3\n\n(4.7)\n\nso that Z3 acts freely on the sphere. The U (1)R symmetry of the gauge theory can be\nidentified with shifts along the Hopf fiber coordinate \u03c8 when S 5 /Z3 is described as a U (1)\nbundle over CP 2\n\u0001\nds2 = (d\u03c8 + sin2 \u03bc \u03c33 )2 + d\u03bc2 + sin2 \u03bc \u03c312 + \u03c322 + cos2 \u03bc \u03c332 ,\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere \u03c3i are a set of left-invariant SU (2) one forms satisfying d\u03c3i = \u01ebijk \u03c3j \u2227 \u03c3k . The Z3\n\norbifold group acts by restricting the range of the \u03c8 coordinate to 1/3 of the usual value\n\nfor S 5 while leaving all other coordinates intact. We introduce null coordinates\n1\n(t + \u03c8)\n2\nL2\nx\u2212 =\n(t \u2212 \u03c8)\n2\nx+ =\n\n(4.9)\n\ntaking the L \u2192 \u221e near \u03bc = \u03c1 = 0 with8\n\u03c1=\n7\n\nr\nL\n\n\u03bc=\n\ny\n.\nL\n\n(4.10)\n\nIn the earlier version of this paper, we claimed that the Penrose limit of the Maldacena-Nu\u00f1ez\n\nsolution is identical to the Nappi-Witten geometry (4.5). We thank Juan Maldacena and Horatiu\nNastase for pointing out an error in our argument. Our observation about the enhancement of\nsupersymmetry in this case still remains true.\n8\n\nThe \u03c1 coordinate comes the AdS5 part of the metric.\n\n17\n\n\fIn the limit one gets\n2\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nds = \u22124dx dx +\n\n4\nX\ni=1\n\n(dr i dr i \u2212 r i r i dx+ dx+ + dy i dy i ) + 2y 2 dx+ \u03c33 ,\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere yi are Cartesian coordinates in R4 . By introducing a pair of complex coordinates\nza for R4 one can show that (4.11) can be rewritten as\n4\nX\nX\n\u0001\n(dr i dr i \u2212 r i r i dx+ dx+ ) +\ndza dz\u0304a + i(za dz\u0304a \u2212 z\u0304a dza )dx+ ,\nds = \u22124dx dx +\n2\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\na\n\ni=1\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhich we have already shown is the same as the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave metric\n(1.1). So we have another example in which a subsector of a four dimensional N = 1 gauge\n\ntheory is enhanced to N = 4. It would be interesting to match the string oscillators in\nthis background with operators in the quiver gauge theory.\n\nWe should note, however, that the Penrose limit does not always enhance supersymmetry. For example, we can consider the dual pair generated by placing a collection of\nD3-branes at a C 2 /Z2 orbifold singularity. The gauge theory is a four dimensional N = 2\ngauge theory [25] and the gravity dual is AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 /Z2 [26], where the S 5 is described by\n\n(4.6) and the Z2 generator g acts by\n\ng * z1 = \u2212z1\n\ng * z2 = \u2212 z2 .\n\n(4.13)\n\nThus the Z2 action has as fixed locus an S 1 described by |z3 |2 = 1 at z1 = z2 = 0. The\ncoordinate parametrizing the fixed S 1 can be identified with the \u03c8 coordinate considered\n\nin the Penrose limit of AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 [10]. Therefore, the corresponding pp-wave limit is\n\ngiven by the Z2 orbifold of the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave (1.1), where Z2 acts\non an R4 subspace of the transverse R8 space. The main difference between this and the\nprevious orbifold is that \u03c8 is not acted by Z2 while the other angles on the S 5 have Z2\nidentifications. This is related to the fact that the S 5 has a fixed circle in this case.\nTo find the amount of supesymmetry left unbroken by the orbifold, one must find\nwhich components of the Killing spinors of the pp-wave geometry (1.1) are left invariant\nunder the Z2 action. The Killing spinors of (1.1) were found [7] and take the form\n\u01eb(x, y, x+) = f (x, y, x+)\u01eb0 ,\n18\n\n(4.14)\n\n\fwhere x and y are the transverse R4 \u00d7 R4 coordinates, f is a function which can be\n\nfound in [7] and \u01eb0 is a constant SO(8) spinor. The amount of unbroken supersymmetry\n\nis the number of Killing spinors (4.14) left invariant under the Z2 action. Therefore, the\nunbroken supersymmetries satisfy\n\u01eb(x, y, x+) =g * \u01eb(x, y, x+)\n=\u03b3 5678 \u01eb(x, \u2212y, x+ )\n\n(4.15)\n\n=f (x, y, x+)\u03b3 5678 \u01eb0 ,\nnamely,\n\u03b3 5678 \u01eb0 = \u01eb0 .\n\n(4.16)\n\nTherefore the orbifold preserves 1/2 of the supersymmetry which is generated by Killing\nspinors satisfying this condition.\n\n5. Discussion\nIn this paper we have given an explicit example of an N = 1 superconformal field\n\ntheory which, in the large N limit, has a subsector of the Hilbert space with enhanced\n\nN = 4 superconformal symmetry. We have arrived at this perhaps unexpected conclusion\nby taking the corresponding limit in the string theory side and by showing that it becomes\n\nidentical to the theory with higher supersymmetry. The subsector of the gauge theory that\nshould exhibit this symmetry enhancement is dictated by the Penrose limit which restricts\nthe space of states of the gauge theory to those whose conformal dimension and R-charge\ndiverge in the large N limit but which nevertheless have finite (\u2206 \u2212 23 R).\n\nThe light-cone Hamiltonian for the background that one obtains in the limit can be\n\nfound from the Hamiltonian of [6] for the maximally supersymmetric case by twisting it\nwith U (1) charges. In this way we get a prediction for the spectrum of (\u2206 \u2212 32 R) of the\n\nN = 1 superconformal field theory. We proposed how stringy excitations are related to\ngauge theory operators and made predictions about the gauge theory spectrum. Perhaps\n\nthe most striking one is that the various N = 1 multiplets should turn into multiplets\nof N = 4 supersymmetry. In particular, the chiral multiplets and the semi-conserved\n\nmultiplets of N = 1 supersymmetry should combine into N = 4 chiral multiplets. It\n\nwould be interesting to explore this prediction further. The duality also predicts values of\n(\u2206 \u2212 32 R) for certain operators in this strongly coupled gauge theory.\n19\n\n\fWe have shown that the enhancement of symmetry in the Penrose limit is a fairly\ngeneric phenomenon in theories which have gravity duals. One can intuitively understand\nthis as due to the fact that the limit flattens out parts of spacetime by focusing on a\nregion near a null geodesic. For example, we found that the Penrose limit of a collection\nof flat NS-NS five-branes is the Nappi-Witten geometry. The limit of the MaldacenaNu\u00f1ez geometry is its variation and also has 16 supercharges. This is an interesting case\nsince we can quantize the worldsheet theory without taking the light-cone gauge, and we\ncan compute correlation functions and other observables using the standard techniques of\nconformal field theory [27]. On the other hand, we also found cases in which the Penrose\nlimit does not lead to symmetry enhancement. It would be interesting to explore further\nthe consequences of this enhancement of symmetries for QCD-like theories and see which\nlessons this might teach us for the familiar questions about strongly coupled dynamics of\nthese gauge theories.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Andreas Brandhuber, Sergio Ferrara, Juan Maldacena, Sunil\nMukhi, Horatiu Nastase, and John Schwarz for useful discussion.

The Hamiltonian can\nbe diagonalized by introducing a new set of oscillators \u03b1n and \u03b2n defined by\n\u2020\nan = cosh \u03b8\u03b1n + sinh \u03b8\u03b2\u2212n\n, a\u2020n = cosh \u03b8\u03b1\u2020n + sinh \u03b8\u03b2\u2212n ,\n\nbn = cosh \u03b8\u03b2n + sinh \u03b8\u03b1\u2020\u2212n , b\u2020n = cosh \u03b8\u03b2n\u2020 + sinh \u03b8\u03b1\u2212n .\n\n(A.18)\n\nThey obey the commutation relations\n[\u03b1n , \u03b1\u2020n ] = 1, [\u03b2n , \u03b2n\u2020 ] = 1, (others) = 0.\n\n(A.19)\n\nThe vacuum state for \u03b1, \u03b2 is related to the one for a, b by the Bogolubov transformation.\nSubstituting these into (A.17) and requiring that the cross terms of \u03b1 and \u03b2 to vanish, we\nfind\ne\u22124\u03b8 = 1 + \u03c9 2 .\n23\n\n(A.20)\n\n\fIn terms of the new set of oscillators, the Hamiltonian Hn is then expressed as\nHn =\n\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n1 + \u03c9 2 + 1 \u03b1\u2020n \u03b1n +\n1 + \u03c9 2 \u2212 1 \u03b2n\u2020 \u03b2n\np\n+ (n \u2192 \u2212n) + 2 1 + \u03c9 2 .\n\n(A.21)\n\nHere we have chosen a solution so that, in the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0, the oscillators become \u03b1n \u2192 an\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2020\nand \u03b2n \u2192 bn . Energy eigenstates of Hn are then given by (\u03b1\u2020n )m (\u03b1\u2020\u2212n )m (\u03b2n\u2020 )k (\u03b2\u2212n\n)k |0i,\n\nwhere |0i is the vacuum state for the \u03b1, \u03b2 oscillators. The state carries the energy,\nEm,m\u2032 ,k,k\u2032 = (m + m\u2032 )\n\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n1 + \u03c9 2 + 1 + (k + k \u2032 )\n1 + \u03c92 \u2212 1 ,\n\nand the global U(1) charge (k + k \u2032 \u2212 m \u2212 m\u2032 ).\n\nCombining this with the result for the zero mode, the complete spectrum for the (x, y)\n\npart of the light-cone Hamiltonian is given by\n\nHxy\u2212part =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ebs\n\n\uf8f0Nn(\u03b1) \uf8ed\n\n1+\n\n\u0012\n\nn\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\n\n\u00132\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ebs\n\n+ 1\uf8f8 + Nn(\u03b2) \uf8ed\n\n1+\n\n\u0012\n\nn\n\u03b1\u2032 p+\n\n\u00132\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n\n\u2212 1\uf8f8\uf8fb .\n\n(A.22)\n\nThis result agrees with the one we obtained in section 2, with the identification:\n\u03b1n = w\u0304n , \u03b2n = wn\nin (2.14).\n\n24\n\n(A.23)\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J.
