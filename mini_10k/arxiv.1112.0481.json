Considerable research efforts are currently devoted\nto elucidating mechanisms by which pairs of electrons can bind together through\nthe mediation of a boson field different than the one associated to the vibrations\nof a crystal lattice. PuCoGa5 , a 5f -electron heavy-fermion superconductor with a\nrecord critical temperature Tc = 18.5 K, is one of the many compounds for which the\nshort-range, isotropic attraction provided by simple electron-phonon coupling does\nnot appear as an adequate glue for electron pairing. Magnetic, or virtual valence\nfluctuations may have an important role in the stabilization of the superconducting ground state in PuCoGa5 , but the specific nature of the coupling mechanism\nremains obscure. Here, we report the results of point-contact spectroscopy measurements in single crystals of PuCoGa5 . Andreev reflection structures are clearly\nobserved in the low-temperature spectra, and unambiguously prove that the paired\nsuperconducting electrons have wavefunction with the d-wave symmetry of a fourleaf clover. A straightforward analysis of the spectra provide the amplitude of the\ngap and its temperature dependence, \u2206(T ). We obtain \u2206(T \u2192 0) = 5.1 \u00b1 0.3 meV\nand a gap ratio, 2\u2206/kB Tc = 6.5 \u00b1 0.3, indicating that the compound is in the regime\nof strong electron-boson coupling. The gap value and its temperature dependence\ncan be well reproduced within the Eliashberg theory for superconductivity if the\nspectral function of the mediating bosons has a spin-fluctuations-like shape, with a\npeak energy of 6.5 meV. Electronic structure calculations, combining the local density approximation with an exact diagonalization of the Anderson impurity model,\nprovide a hint about the possible origin of the fluctuations.\nPuCoGa5 , discovered in 2002, has the highest critical temperature (Tc =18.5 K) among\nheavy-fermion superconductors [1]. Though the \u03b1-activity and the toxicity of Pu make it\nunsuitable for practical purposes, this material has being challenging the researchers since its\ndiscovery. As a matter of fact, it seems to elude any classification. The Sommerfeld coefficient\n\u03b3, as measured by specific-heat experiments, is between 58 and 95 mJ/(mol K) [1, 2]. The\neffective mass of electrons is about 1/5 of that measured for the isostructural unconventional\nsuperconductor CeCoIn5 , [2], suggesting a smaller degree of electronic correlation.\nThe magnetic properties of PuCoGa5 and their possible relationship with the superconducting pairing have been debated, mainly because of conflicting results about the magnitude\n2\n\n\fof the magnetic moment carried by the Pu ions. A Curie-Weiss susceptibility in the normal\nstate was initially observed [1], as expected for fluctuating local Pu3+ moments. Successive\n\u03bcSR studies showed no static, normal-state electronic magnetism in PuCoGa5 [3, 4] and polarized neutron diffraction experiments showed a small and temperature-independent microscopic\nmagnetization dominated by the orbital moment [27].\nThe amplitude of the gap (or at least of the gap ratio 2\u2206/kB Tc ) has been estimated by\ndifferent techniques. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to measure the Knight shift in\nthe superconducting state of a sample with Tc =18.5 K, Curro et al. obtain 2\u2206/kB Tc = 8 (\u2206 \u223c\n6.3 meV) [11].\nFrom the theoretical and computational point of view, PuCoGa5 is a real challenge. Various band structure calculations have been reported [8\u201313, 23, 29], showing that the details of\nthe Fermi surface (FS) and the value of the local magnetic moment depend on the theoretical approach. In a local density/generalized gradient approximations (LDA/GGA), the FS is\nquasi-two dimensional [8, 11, 13, 23], with at least two nearly-cylindrical sheets, one hole-like\naround the \u0393 = (0, 0, 0) point of the reciprocal space (kx , ky , kz ), and one electron-like around\nthe M = (\u03c0, \u03c0, 0) point. This bears a similarity to what more recently observed in Fe-based\nsuperconductors. The coupling mechanism that seems to account for the high-Tc superconductivity in iron pnictides (based on the nesting between hole and electron FS sheets through a\nvector associated with a peak in the spin susceptibility) had been proposed earlier for PuCoGa5\n[10]. The FS remains qualitatively unchanged with the addition of the Coulomb-U interaction\n[29].\nSeveral experimental facts [2, 3, 11, 12, 15\u201317] suggest that in PuCoGa5 the electrons in\nthe pairs have a mutual angular momentum l = 2, corresponding to a superconducting order\nparameter (OP) with dx2 \u2212y2 symmetry, i. e. the gap in the single-particle excitation spectrum\nhas a line of nodes intersecting the Fermi surface. A direct proof of the gap symmetry is,\nhowever, still missing. This is an important point, as the symmetry of the OP is closely\nrelated to the pairing mechanism. For instance, whilst isotropic electron-phonon attraction\nfavors the formation of zero-angular-momentum pairs, with a spherically symmetric OP, dwave symmetry is most easily realized if the pairing interaction is repulsive at short-range\nand anisotropic at larger distances, as the one provided by effective spin-spin couplings on the\nborder of antiferromagnetism [19].\nA magnetic nature of the Cooper pairing mediator in PuCoGa5 has been discussed by several\n3\n\n\fauthors (see Ref. [20] for a recent review). Flint et al. [21] considered virtual valence fluctuations of the magnetic Pu configurations, creating Kondo screening channels with different\nsymmetry, and demonstrated that in a lattice of magnetic ions, exchanging spin with conduction electrons in two different channels, a condensate of composite pairs between local moments\nand electrons is formed. These models must be reconciled with the temperature-independent\nsusceptibility observed in the normal state [27]. A phononic mechanism in the framework of\nthe d-wave Eliashberg theory has been discussed in Ref. [12]. Although able to reproduce a\nnumber of experimental observations, this model requires an electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling\nconstant \u03bb that is much higher than the value experimentally deduced from the time relaxation\nof photo-induced quasiparticles [22] (\u03bb = 0.2-0.26).\nWe performed point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy (PCARS) measurements in\nfreshly annealed single crystals of\n\n239\n\nPuCoGa5 , grown by a flux method and characterized\n\nby x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetization and specific heat measurements. The\npoint contacts were made between a fresh, mirror-like surface of the crystal (just exposed by\nbreaking the sample) and a thin Au wire (about 10 \u03bcm in diameter). The uneven broken surface on which the contact is made prevents a fine control of the direction of current injection\nwith respect to the crystallographic axes. However, as shown below, this does not prevent the\nunambiguous determination of the amplitude and symmetry of the OP.\nFig. 1 presents the temperature dependence of the raw conductance curves of a point contact\nwhose normal-state resistance is 6.2 \u03a9. All the curves but the lowest-temperature one are shifted\ndownward for clarity. The top curve is measured at T = 1.8 K, that means about Tc /10. This\nensures that the gap extracted from it is well representative of the gap for T \u2192 0. The highenergy tails of the conductance curves are temperature independent, as shown in the inset,\nwhere the curves measured at T = 1.8 K and in the normal state are reported without vertical\noffset as an example. This demonstrates that the contact is in the perfectly ballistic regime,\nwith no contribution from Maxwell terms in the contact resistance, i.e. there is no diffusion\nin the contact region and the maximum excess energy with which the electrons are injected\ninto the superconductor is exactly eV . Meeting this condition is essential for energy-resolved\nspectroscopy to be possible. The absence of heating effects in the contact is also witnessed by\nthe coincidence between the Andreev critical temperature TcA (i.e. the temperature at which the\nAndreev signal disappears and the normal-state conductance is recovered, here between 18.0 K\nand 18.5 K) and the bulk Tc , as determined from resistivity measurements (Tc = 18.1 K, see\n4\n\n\fFig. 6 in the Supplementary Material).\nIt is worth noticing that the point-contact curves in PuCoGa5 do not show the strong\nasymmetry observed for CeCoIn5 below the temperature where a coherent heavy-fermion liquid\ndevelops [35]. The asymmetric conductance in CeCoIn5 has been explained in terms of a Fano\nresonance involving localized states near the interface and itinerant heavy electrons in the\nbulk [36]. The absence of a strong, temperature dependent asymmetry in PuCoGa5 may thus\nconfirm that superconductivity develops out of an incoherent metallic state [25].\nIn order to compare the experimental curves to the theoretical ones, a normalization is required, i.e. a division by the conductance of the same point contact when the superconductor is\nin the normal state. Because of the extremely high value of the upper critical field in PuCoGa5 ,\nthis cannot be achieved by applying a magnetic field to suppress superconductivity at low temperature. However, owing to the moderate Tc and the negligible temperature dependence of\nthe normal state conductance (witnessed by the absence of any change in shape of the tails of\nthe conductance curves at |eV | > 15 meV) we can safely normalize the conductance curves at\nany T < TcA by the normal state conductance curve measured at (or just above) TcA .\n\nThe result of this normalization is shown in Fig. 2 for two contacts made on different\nplaces of freshly-broken surfaces of the same sample. The two contacts have the same TcA\nbut different normal-state resistance RN . The curve shown in Fig. 2a presents a very clear\nzero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP), whose amplitude (greater than 2) can only be explained\nby assuming a nodal OP with a change of sign at the Fermi surface. Indeed, the shape of\nthe conductance curve is similar to those shown for a dimensionless barrier strength Z = 1\n[1, 2] in Fig. (1d) of the Supplementary Material, and clearly indicates that the OP has a\nd-wave symmetry. The peak is ascribed to zero-energy Andreev bound states, arising from\nthe constructive interference between electron-like and hole-like quasiparticles that feel order\nparameters with different signs [3].\nAnother important point to notice is that, unlike in other heavy-fermion compounds like\nCeCoIn5 [36], the Andreev signal is very high in the superconducting phase; the curve is similar\nto the best ones ever observed in cuprates [29\u201332]. It thus seems that in PuCoGa5 there is no\nneed to assume multichannel tunneling in the presence of localized states near the interface, as\ninstead is the case in CeCoIn5 [36].\nThe conductance curve shown in Fig. 2b has a very different shape than the curve in Fig.\n2a, reflecting a change from \u03b1 = \u03c0/4 to \u03b1 = \u03c0/8 of the angle between the direction of the\n5\n\n\fcurrent injection (here in the kx -ky plane) and the kx axis. As a matter of fact, the curve\nin Fig. 2b looks similar to those shown in Fig. (1c) of the Supplementary Material, which\nhave been obtained at T = 0 for intermediate values of Z (0.5-0.7) and a misorientation angle\n\u03b1 = \u03c0/8.\nSolid lines in Fig. 2 are the results of a quantitative spectral analysis using the 2-dimensional\nBlonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (2D-BTK) formalism [1\u20133]. The parameters of the model are \u2206\n(here intended as the maximum amplitude of the gap), the barrier strength Z, the angle \u03b1, and\na broadening parameter \u0393 that must usually be included in the model when fitting experimental\ncurves. Here \u0393 \u226a \u2206 so that it does not add any ambiguity to the determination of the gap\namplitude. The best-fitting values of these parameters are indicated in the labels. The fit of\nthe curves gives very similar values of the gap, and this is certainly the most important result,\nbut also the barrier and broadening parameters are very similar. This means that the very\ndifferent shape of the two curves almost completely depends on the angle \u03b1 which is different\nin the two cases, as shown pictorially in the insets.\nFig. 3a shows an example of how the normalized conductance curves evolve on increasing\ntemperature. The experimental data (symbols) are compared to the 2D-BTK fit (solid lines).\nThe fit is rather good at any temperature; note that both Z and \u03b1 are independent on T\nand were thus kept constant for all curves. We also kept \u0393 nearly constant so that the only\nparameter that varies significantly with temperature is the gap amplitude \u2206.\nThe temperature dependence of the gap as obtained from the fit of three different sets of\nconductance curves (in three different contacts) is shown in Fig. 3b. It is clear that the values\nare rather well reproducible; at low temperature, the gap values range between 4.85 and 5.30\nmeV, corresponding to a gap ratio 2\u2206/kB Tc = 6.2 \u2212 6.7. The vertical spread of gap values can\nbe used to evaluate a posteriori the uncertainty on the gap itself; this is obviously much greater\nthan the uncertainty arising from the fit of a single curve, which can be empirically determined\nas the range of gap values that allow an acceptable (i.e. within some confidence limit) fit of the\nconductance curve, when all the other parameters are varied as well. The spread of gap values\nis small at low temperature and maximum around 14 K. Although the general trend of the gap\nseems to be compatible with a BCS-like \u2206(T ) dependence (but of course, with a non-BCS gap\nratio), this uncertainty does not allow discussing it in detail.\nThe solid line in Fig. 3b is not a fit of the data, but is calculated within the strongcoupling theory for superconductivity (known as Eliashberg theory [4, 5]) by assuming that\n6\n\n\fthe superconducting coupling is mediated by spin fluctuations. In particular, we used the\ntypical spin-fluctuation spectrum with the form [8]: \u03b12 Fd (\u03a9) \u221d\n\n\u03a9\u03a90 \u03b8(\u03a9max \u2212\u03a9)\n\u03a92 +\u03a920\n\nwhere \u03a90 is the\n\nenergy peak, \u03a9max is a cut off energy that we chose as being \u03a9max = 4\u03a90 [9]. The line in\nFig. 3b is obtained by taking \u03a90 = 6.5 meV and using an electron-boson coupling constant\n\u03bb = 2.37. Details of the calculations are given as Supplementary Material. Assuming physically\nreasonable values of the Coulomb pseudopotential \u03bc\u2217 (0 \u2264 \u03bc\u2217 \u2264 0.2) [5], the observed \u2206(T )\ncurve pose a stringent limit on the characteristic boson energy, namely 5.3 \u2264 \u03a90 \u2264 8 meV.\nThis energy range is compatible with that determined by recent NMR measurements [13] for\nthe characteristic spin-fluctuation energy in PuCoGa5 , that is 4 \u2264 \u03a9S \u2264 8 meV.\nAs a test of the reliability and generality of the results discussed so far, we also performed\nPCARS measurements in 242 PuCoGa5 crystals featuring a lower Tc =14.5 K, due to the presence\nof Sb impurities (less than 1 %). The experimental results (shown as Supplementary Material)\nhave been analyzed following the procedure described above, using the same spectral function\nand coupling constant as in Fig. 3b. We obtain a gap ratio 2\u2206/kB Tc = 6.2 \u00b1 0.4, showing that\n\u2206(T \u2192 0) scales with Tc .\nA scenario where magnetic fluctuations are responsible for the formation of the Cooper pairs\nin PuCoGa5 must be reconciled with the observed temperature-independent magnetic susceptibility [27] that points to vanishing local moments at the Pu sites. A plausible explanation is\nprovided by electronic structure calculations combining the local density approximation (LDA)\nwith the exact diagonalization (ED) [38] of a discretized single-impurity Anderson model [16].\nIn this approach, the band structure obtained by the relativistic version of the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method (FP-LAPW) [21] is consistently extended to account for\nthe full structure of the f -orbital atomic multiplets and their hybridization with the conduction\nbands [19]. Details on this procedure are given in the Supplementary Material.\nThe resulting f -orbital density of states (DOS) is shown in Fig. 4a. Below the Fermi energy\nEF , the DOS exhibits a three-peak structure that is typical for Pu and for a number of its\ncompounds. Peaks characterized by the total moment j = 5/2 occur at EF (peak labelled A)\nand at about 1 eV below EF (peak C). The j = 7/2 peak B is located in between at approximately 0.5 eV below EF . The DOS is in a reasonably good agreement with the results of the\nnon-crossing approximation reported in Ref. [26].\nFig. 4b shows the valence histogram calculated by projecting the ground state of the impurity\nmodel |\u03a9i onto the Pu atomic eigenstates |mi that correspond to an integer f -shell occupation\n7\n\n\fnm . The plotted probabilities Pm determine the f -orbital valence hnf i =\n\nP\n\nm\n\nPm nm = 5.3.\n\nThe highest obtained probability is P5 = 0.63, followed by P6 = 0.33. In addition, there are\nsmall but non-zero probabilities P4 = 0.03 and P7 = 0.01. This result indicates a mixed-valence\nnature of the Pu f shell that consists of a mixture of a magnetic f 5 sextet and a non-magnetic\nf 6 singlet, which is similar to the case of \u03b4-Pu [43]. This mixed (also referred to as intermediate)\nvalence is consistent with a large value of the \u03b3-coefficient, as typically observed in the mixedvalence rare-earth-based materials. The same materials display a temperature-independent\nmagnetic susceptibility at low temperatures if one of the involved atomic configurations is nonmagnetic [44], which further strengthens the analogy between the mixed-valence rare-earth\ncompounds and the f -electron physics in PuCoGa5 .\nThe Pu f shell carries a non-vanishing average moment as it fluctuates between the singlet\nand the sextet. The expectation values hX\u0302 2 i = X(X + 1), where X = S, L and J, calculated\n\nfor the f shell give S (5f ) = 2.18, L(5f ) = 4.05 and J (5f ) = 2.43 for the spin, orbital and total\n\nmoments. In the same time, the ground state |\u03a9i of the entire impurity model is a singlet\nthat corresponds to all angular momenta being equal zero (S = L = J = 0). Therefore,\nthe fluctuations in the f shell are accompanied by canceling antiferromagnetic fluctuations\nin the conduction bands, which can be viewed as a manifestation of the Kondo physics. In\naddition, our band-structure calculations suggest an antiferromagnetic instability due to the\npresence of a Fermi-surface sheet with a negative second derivative of the Drude plasma energy\n(Supplementary Material).\nIn conclusion, we have performed point-contact Andreev-reflection measurements in\nPuCoGa5 single crystals with different values of Tc due to different degrees of disorder. We\nhave shown that PCARS spectra unambiguously indicate that the OP has a d-wave symmetry,\nconsistent with indirect indications from NMR and \u03bcSR measurements. The amplitude of the\ngap at T \u2192 0 is \u2206 = 5.1\u00b10.3, as determined from the fit of different curves, and corresponds to\na gap ratio 2\u2206/kB Tc = 6.4 \u00b1 0.4. In crystals with Sb impurities and a reduced Tc = 14.5 K, the\nAndreev signal is greatly reduced, possibly because of a larger quasiparticle scattering in the\nsuperconducting bank arising from self-induced disorder and impurities. The gap scales with\nTc , giving the same gap ratio as in the highest-Tc crystals, within the experimental uncertainty.\nIn both cases, the temperature dependence of the gap is consistent with the predictions of the\nEliashberg theory for strong-coupling superconductivity if spin fluctuations provide the mediating bosons. A characteristic boson energy \u03a90 = 6.5 meV and a coupling constant \u03bb = 2.37\n8\n\n\fallow reproducing the low-temperature gap values. These results show that PuCoGa5 is an\nunconventional, d-wave superconductor in the strong-coupling regime, and indicate spin fluctuations as the probable boson that mediates superconductivity. Such fluctuations would involve\na time-dependent 5f local moment dynamically compensated by a moment momentarily formed\nin the surrounding cloud of conduction electrons.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThis work has been performed at the Institute of Transuranium Elements within its Actinide User Laboratory program, with financial support to users provided by the European\nCommission.\n\nCorresponding author\n\nCorrespondence and requests for materials should be addressed to Roberto Caciuffo,\nroberto.caciuffo@ec.europa.eu, or to D.

The technique consists in creating a N-S contact between a normal metal (N) and a superconductor (S), whose radius a is smaller than both the\nelectronic mean-free path and the coherence length in S. In these conditions, an electron travels\nthrough the contact ballistically, i.e. without being diffused, so that if a voltage V is kept at\nthe junction's end, it enters the superconductor with a maximum excess energy eV . When this\nenergy is smaller than the gap in the superconductor, \u2206, the electron cannot propagate in S\nas an electron-like quasiparticle (ELQ), because it finds no available states. Thus, it forms a\nCooper pair and a hole is retro-reflected in N.\nIf the gap is isotropic (Fig. 5a, top) and there is no potential barrier at the interface, this\nresults in a doubling of the conductance for |V | \u2264 \u2206/e (see Fig. 5b, top curve). If |eV | > \u2206, the\nconductance decreases again towards the value it would have if the superconductor was in the\nnormal state. If a barrier is present, other phenomena take place that can give rise to a normal\nreflection of the incoming electron, and also to the transmission of hole-like quasiparticles (HLQ)\nin S. As a result, the conductance presents two maxima at approximately V = \u00b1\u2206/e and a\nzero-bias minimum (see Fig. 5b).\nIf instead the energy gap has a dependence on the direction, i.e. the gap is anisotropic,\nelectrons injected along different directions may experience different gap amplitudes. In this\ncase, it is mandatory to integrate over all the possible directions along which the electrons\ncan arrive to the interface. In particular, for a dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry of the gap, \u2206(\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\u22060 cos(2\u03b8) sin2 (\u03c6), where \u03b8 is the azimuthal angle in the kx , ky plane of the reciprocal space\nand \u03c6 the inclination angle (see Fig. 5a, bottom), the shape of the conductance curves does\nnot depend only on the height of the potential barrier at the interface, but also on the angle\nbetween the direction of current injection (i.e. the normal to the interface) and the kx axis.\nThis angle will be called \u03b1 in the following.\n14\n\n\fThe curves shown in Fig. 5 were calculated by using the so called 2D-BTK model [1\u20133] where\nthe problem is reduced to a two-dimensional one and the Fermi surface (FS) is supposed to be\nperfectly cylindrical (with its axis parallel to the kz axis). This means that the dependence of\nthe OP on \u03c6 is disregarded. In this paper, based on the mostly 2D shape of the largest FS\nsheets and also for simplicity, we have always used this model. It can be shown [3] that, with\nrespect to a more refined 3D model, this approximation generally gives rise to an overestimation\nof the parameter Z, proportional to the height of the potential barrier at the interface, which\nis not relevant in our analysis.\nIf \u03b1 = 0, for any angle of incidence (\u03b8) of the incoming electron, ELQ and HLQ transmitted\nin S with angles +\u03b8 and \u2212\u03b8 feel the same order parameter, in amplitude and sign. The\nconductance in this case is doubled only at zero bias where it shows a characteristic cusp. If\nthere is no barrier, the same shape is obtained for any value of \u03b1: the conductance curve always\nlooks like the top curve in Fig. 5c. If instead a barrier is present, for any \u03b1 6= 0 some values\nof \u03b8 exist for which HLQ and ELQ feel order parameters of opposite sign [3]. This gives rise\nto constructive interference between HLQ and ELQ that results in localized zero-energy states\n(Andreev bound states). These states manifest themselves in the conductance giving rise to a\npeak at zero bias (ZBCP). When \u03b1 = \u03c0/4 the current is injected along the nodal direction, all\nELQ and HLQ interfere and the ZBCP is maximum. An example of calculated (normalized)\nconductance curves assuming \u03b1 = \u03c0/8 and \u03b1 = \u03c0/4 is shown in Figs. 5c and 5d for increasing\nvalues of Z.\n\nII.\n\nSOLUTION OF ELIASHBERG EQUATIONS\n\nIn the imaginary-axis representation, the d-wave, one-band Eliashberg theory [4, 5] is formulated by the following equations for the gap \u2206n (\u03c6) = \u2206(i\u03c9n , \u03c6) and the renormalization\nfunctions Zn (\u03c6) = Z (i\u03c9n , \u03c6):\n\n\u03c9n Zn (\u03c6) = \u03c9n + \u03c0T\n\nXZ\nm\n\n+ \u03b3d\n\nNnZ\nc2 + (NnZ )2\n\n15\n\n0\n\n;\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6\u2032\nZ\n\u03bbnm (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032)Nm\n(\u03c6\u2032 )\n2\u03c0\n(1)\n\n\fZn (\u03c6)\u2206n (\u03c6) = \u03c0T\n\nXZ\nm\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n\nd\u03c6\u2032\n2\u03c0\n\n\u2206\n\u00d7[\u03bbnm (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032) \u2212 \u03bc\u2217 (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 )\u03b8(\u03c9c \u2212 |\u03c9m |)]Nm\n(\u03c6\u2032 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the Heaviside function, \u03c9c is a cut-off energy for the Coulomb pseudopotential\np\np\n\u2206\n2 + \u22062 (\u03c6), N Z (\u03c6) = \u03c9 /\n2 + \u2206 (\u03c6)2 , and N Z is an angular\n\u03bc\u2217 , and Nm\n(\u03c6) = \u2206m (\u03c6)/ \u03c9m\n\u03c9m\nm\nm\nm\nm\nn\n\naverage of NnZ (\u03c6\u2032 ) over the Fermi surface.\n\nThe parameter \u03b3d is proportional to the concentration of defects and c is a parameter related\nto the electron phase shift for scattering off an impurity [6]. The nth Matsubara frequency is\ndefined as i\u03c9n = i\u03c0T (2n \u2212 1), and T is the temperature; \u03bbnm (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032) = \u03bb(i\u03c9m \u2212 i\u03c9n , \u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 ) is\nrelated to the electron-boson spectral function \u03b12 (\u03a9)F (\u03a9, \u03c6, \u03c6\u2032 ) through the following equation:\n\u2032\n\n\u03bb(i\u03c9m \u2212 i\u03c9n , \u03c6, \u03c6 ) =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n0\n\n2\u03a9\u03b12 F (\u03a9, \u03c6, \u03c6\u2032)\nd\u03a9,\n(\u03c9m \u2212 \u03c9n )2 + \u03a92\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the boson frequency. We made the usual lowest-order approximation that both\nthe electron-boson spectral function and the Coulomb pseudopotential contain separate s- and\nd -wave contributions [7]:\n\u03b12 F (\u03a9, \u03c6, \u03c6\u2032) = \u03b12 Fs (\u03a9) + 2\u03b12 Fd (\u03a9)cos(2\u03c6)cos(2\u03c6\u2032)\n\n(4)\n\n\u03bc\u2217 (\u03c6, \u03c6\u2032) = \u03bc\u2217s + 2\u03bc\u2217d (\u03a9)cos(2\u03c6)cos(2\u03c6\u2032)\n\n(5)\n\nand\n\nThen we assumed for simplicity that \u03b12 Fs (\u03a9) = \u03b12 Fd (\u03a9), and that \u03b12 Fd (\u03a9) has the typical\nshape of spin fluctuation spectral functions [8]: \u03b12 Fd (\u03a9) \u221d\n\n\u03a9\u03a90 \u03b8(\u03a9max \u2212\u03a9)\n\u03a92 +\u03a920\n\nwhere \u03a90 is the energy\n\npeak, \u03a9max is a cut off energy \u03a9max = 4\u03a90 [9] and \u03c9c = 3\u03a9max .\nWe then looked for solutions of the equations having pure d-wave symmetry for the gap\n\u221a\nfunction \u2206(\u03c9, \u03c6\u2032 ) = \u2206d (\u03c9) 2cos(2\u03c6\u2032 ) and pure s-wave form for the renormalization function\nZ(\u03c9, \u03c6\u2032) = Zs (\u03c9); the reason for this choice is that the only solution of the homogeneous integral\nequation for Zd (\u03c9) is Zd (\u03c9) = 0, at least for reasonable values of \u03bbd [10]. Note that, if a dwave symmetry for the gap function is assumed, the parameter \u03bc\u2217s does not enter into the two\nrelevant Eliashberg equations. Therefore, although it is certainly larger than \u03bc\u2217d , it does not\nR +\u221e\n2\ninfluence the solution. The free parameters are then: \u03b3d , c, \u03a90 , \u03bc\u2217d and \u03bb = 0 2\u03a9\u03b1 \u03a9Fd (\u03a9) d\u03a9.\n16\n\n\fThe parameters c and \u03b3d were estimated by reanalyzing the normalized local spin susceptibility from the NMR experiment by Curro et al. [11]; in particular, it was necessary to assume\n\u03b3d = 0.25 meV and c = 0 (unitary limit) to fit the shape of the curve [12]. The unitary limit\nis the only possible choice to reproduce the dependence of the critical temperature on disorder\n[12]. As for \u03bc\u2217d , it generally ranges between 0 and 0.2 [5]. Finally, let us mention here that a\nrange for \u03a90 was recently provided by NMR [13] measurements: 4 \u2264 \u03a90 \u2264 8 meV.\nThe value of \u03bb was chosen so as to obtain the experimental critical temperature (Tc = 18.5\nK) by solution of the imaginary-axis Eliashberg equations, and then the experimental lowtemperature gap \u2206 by solution of the real-axis Eliashberg equations [14] for different values\nof \u03a90 and \u03bc\u2217d . Fig. 6a shows the values of the gap as a function of \u03a90 for different values of\n\u03bc\u2217d . The corresponding values of \u03bb are shown in Fig. 6b. From the results of point-contact\nAndreev reflection measurement we know that, in PuCoGa5 single crystals with Tc =18.5 K the\nlow-temperature gap lies in the range 4.8-5.2 meV. As we can see from Fig. 6a, this corresponds\nto an interval of possible values of \u03a90 that goes from 5.3 to about 8.9. From the intersection of\nthis range with that given by NMR measurement [13] one obtains 5.3 \u2264 \u03a90 \u2264 8 meV. Looking\nat Fig. 6b, it is clear that this corresponds to 2.2 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 3.7.\n\nTo reproduce the temperature dependence of the gap, we chose for simplicity \u03bc\u2217d = 0 and\n\nadjusted the values of \u03a90 and \u03bb. We found that the experimental low-temperature gap and the\nTc can be obtained with \u03a90 = 6.5 meV and \u03bb = 2.37.\nIn order to obtain Tc =14.5 K it is necessary to increase the scattering parameter to \u03b3d =1.6\nmeV. In this way, we were able to reproduce the temperature dependence of the gap in the\nlow-Tc samples with the same values of \u03a90 and \u03bb mentioned above (see Fig. 11c). This means\nthat all the difference between the two sets of data can be ascribed to the greater amount of\nimpurity scattering in the lower-Tc crystals.\n\nIII.\n\nELECTRONIC STRUCTURE CALCULATIONS\n\nFollowing Ref. [15] we consider the multi-band Hubbard Hamiltonian H = H 0 + H int , where\nH0 =\n\nXX\n\ni,j \u03b31 ,\u03b32\n\n0\nHi\u03b3\nc\u2020 c =\n1 ,j\u03b32 i\u03b31 j\u03b32\n\nXX\nk\n\nH\u03b301 ,\u03b32 (k)c\u2020\u03b31 (k)c\u03b32 (k)\n\n(6)\n\n\u03b31 ,\u03b32\n\nis the one-particle Hamiltonian found from ab initio electronic structure calculations of a periodic crystal. The indices i, j label lattice sites, \u03b3 = (lm\u03c3) mark spinorbitals {\u03c6\u03b3 }, and k is a\n17\n\n\fvector from the first Brillouin zone. We assume that the electron-electron correlations between\ns, p, and d electrons are well approximated within DFT, and consider the correlations between\nthe f electrons introducing the interaction Hamiltonian\n\u2032\n\nH int\n\n\u03c3,\u03c3\nX\n1X\n=\n2 i m ,m ,m\n1\n\n3 ,m4\n\n2\n\nhm1 , m2 |Viee |m3 , m4 ic\u2020im1 \u03c3 c\u2020im2 \u03c3\u2032 cim4 \u03c3\u2032 cim3 \u03c3 .\n\n(7)\n\nThe operator V ee represents an effective on-site Coulomb interaction [15] expressed in terms of\nthe Slater integrals Fk and the spherical harmonics |lmi.\n\nIn what follows, the effects of the interaction Hamiltonian H int on the electronic structure\n\nare modeled by a k-independent one-particle selfenergy \u03a3(z), which is constructed with the aid\nof an auxiliary impurity model describing the complete seven-orbital f shell including the full\nspherically symmetric Coulomb interaction, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and crystal field (CF).\nThe Hamiltonian of this multi-orbital impurity model can be written as [16]\nHimp =\n\nX\n\n[\u01ebk ]\u03c3mm\u03c3\u2032 b\u2020km\u03c3 bkm\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 +\n\u2032\n\nX \u0002\n\nmm\u2032 \u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\n+\n\nX\u0010\n\n\u03bel * s + \u2206CF\n\u2032\n\n\u03c3\u2032 \u2020\nf f \u2032 \u2032\nmm\u2032 m\u03c3 m \u03c3\n\n\u0003\u03c3\n\n\u2020\n[V k ]\u03c3mm\u03c3\u2032 fm\u03c3\nbkm\u2032 \u03c3\u2032 + h.c.\n\nkmm\u2032\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\n+\n\n\u2020\n\u01ebf fm\u03c3\nfm\u03c3\n\nm\u03c3\n\nkmm\u2032\n\u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u0011\n\n(8)\n\n1 X\n\u2020\n\u2020\nfm\nUmm\u2032 m\u2032\u2032 m\u2032\u2032\u2032 fm\u03c3\n\u2032 \u03c3 \u2032 fm\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u03c3 \u2032 fm\u2032\u2032 \u03c3 ,\n2\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\nmm m\nm\u2032\u2032\u2032 \u03c3\u03c3\u2032\n\n\u2020\nwhere fm\u03c3\ncreates an electron in the f shell and b\u2020m\u03c3 creates an electron in the \"bath\" which\n\nconsists of those host-band states that hybridize with the impurity f shell. The impuritylevel position \u01ebf and the bath energies \u01ebk are measured from the chemical potential \u03bc. The\nparameters \u03be and \u2206CF specify the strength of the SOC and the size of the CF at the impurity.\nThe parameter matrices V k describe the hybridization between the f states and the bath\norbitals at the energies \u01ebk .\nThe band Lanczos method [17, 18] is employed to find the lowest-lying eigenstates of the\nmany-body Hamiltonian Himp and to calculate the one-particle Green's function in the subspace\n\u2032\n\nof the f orbitals [Gimp (z)]\u03c3mm\u03c3\u2032 at low temperature (kB T = 1/500 eV). The sought for selfenergy\n\u2032\n\n[\u03a3(z)]\u03c3mm\u03c3\u2032 is then straightforwardly obtained from the inverse of the Green's function matrix\n\u2032\n\n[Gimp (z)]\u03c3mm\u03c3\u2032 . Note that for the Lanczos method to be applicable, the continuum of the bath\n18\n\n\fstates is discretized. In particular, the calculations presented here utilize only a single value\nfor the index k.\nOnce the selfenergy is known, the local Green's function G(z) for the electrons in the solid\nis calculated as\n\u22121\n[G(z)]\u22121\n\u03b31 \u03b32 = [GLDA (z)]\u03b31 \u03b32 \u2212 \u2206\u01eb \u03b4\u03b31 \u03b32 \u2212 [\u03a3(z)]\u03b31 \u03b32 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u2206\u01eb accounts for the difference between the impurity and the lattice chemical potentials,\nand GLDA (z) is the LDA Green's function,\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121\n1\n[GLDA (z)]\u03b31 \u03b32 =\nd3 k z + \u03bc \u2212 HLDA (k) \u03b31 \u03b32 .\nVBZ BZ\n\n(10)\n\nFor the charge-density self-consistency, we employ the so-called local density matrix approximation (LDMA) [19]. In the LDMA, the occupation matrix\nn\u03b31 \u03b32\n\n1\n= \u2212 Im\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nEF\n\ndz [G(z)]\u03b31 \u03b32\n\n(11)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nis self-consistently evaluated with the aid of the local Green's function G(z) from Eq. (9). The\nmatrix n\u03b31 \u03b32 is then used to construct an effective LDA+U potential VU which is inserted into\nKohn\u2013Sham-like equations,\n[\u2212\u22072 + VLDA (r) + VU + \u03be(l * s)]\u03a6bk (r) = \u01ebbk \u03a6bk (r).\n\n(12)\n\nThese equations are iteratively solved until self-consistency over the charge density is reached.\nIn each iteration, a new Green's function GLDA (z) and a new value of the f -shell occupation are\nobtained from the solution of Eq. (12). Subsequently, a new selfenergy \u03a3(z) corresponding to\nthe updated f -shell occupation is constructed. Finally, the next iteration is started by inserting\nthe new GLDA (z) and \u03a3(z) into Eq. (9). After the iterations are completed, the imaginary part\nof the local Green's function G(z) provides a means to estimate the valence-band photoemission\n(PE) spectra.\nIn the calculations we used the in-house implementation [20, 21] of the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method [22]. This FP-LAPW version includes all\nrelativistic effects: scalar-relativistic and spin-orbit coupling. The calculations were carried out\nassuming a paramagnetic state with the LDA optimized [23] crystal structure parameters of\nPuCoGa5 . The Slater integrals were chosen as F0 = 4.0 eV, and F2 = 7.76 eV, F4 = 5.05 eV,\nand F6 = 3.07 eV [24]. They corresponds to commonly accepted values for Coulomb U = 4.0\n19\n\n\feV and exchange J = 0.64 eV. The SOC parameter was determined from LDA calculations as\n\u03be = 0.28 meV. The crystal-field effects were found to be negligible and we set \u2206CF = 0.\nThe first and fourth terms in the impurity model, Eq. (8), are to a good approximation\ndiagonal in the {j, jz } representation, so that we only need to specify one bath state (six orbitals)\nj=5/2\n\nwith \u01ebk=1\n\nj=5/2\n\nj=7/2\n\nand Vk=1 , and another bath state (eight orbitals) with \u01ebk=1\n\nj=7/2\n\nand Vk=1 . In\n\norder to determine these bath parameters, we assume that LDA represents the non-interacting\nmodel for PuCoGa5 , that is, we associate the LDA solution with the Hamiltonian of Eq. (8)\nwhere we set the Coulomb interaction matrix Umm\u2032 m\u2032\u2032 m\u2032\u2032\u2032 = 0. The numerical values of the\nbath parameters are then found as follows: We calculate the LDA hybridization function \u2206 =\n1\n\u03c0Nf\n\n\u22121\nIm Tr[GLDA\n(\u01eb + i\u03b4)] for j = 5/2 (Nf = 6) and for j = 7/2 (Nf = 8), which is shown in\n\nFig. 7. Assuming that the most important hybridization is the one occurring in the vicinity\nP\n2\n5/2,7/2\nof EF , we obtain Vk=1\nfrom the relation k |Vkj | \u03b4(\u01ebjk \u2212 \u01eb) = \u2206j (\u01eb) [25] averaged over the\n5/2,7/2\n\nenergy interval \u01eb \u2208 (EF \u2212 0.5 eV, EF + 0.5 eV). The bath-state energies \u01ebk=1\napproximately reproduce the LDA 5f -states occupations\n5/2\n\nTABLE I: 5f -states occupations nf , nf\n5/2\n\n7/2\n\n7/2\n\n5/2,7/2\n\nand nf , \u01eb1\n\n5/2\n\n5/2\nnf\n\n5/2\n\nand\n\nare adjusted to\n\n7/2\nnf .\n\n5/2,7/2\n\n(eV) for PuCoGa5 .\n\n7/2\n\n(eV), V1\n\n7/2\n\nnf\n\nnf\n\nnf\n\n\u01eb1\n\nV1\n\n\u01eb1\n\nV1\n\n5.14\n\n4.38\n\n0.76\n\n0.25\n\n0.29\n\n-0.07\n\n0.34\n\nIn what follows, we have adopted the fully-localized (or atomic-like) limit (FLL) for the\ndouble-counting term Vdc = U(nf \u22121/2)\u2212J(nf \u22121)/2 entering the definition of the LDA+U potential VU . In the FP-LAPW calculations we set the radii of the atomic spheres to 3.1 a.u. (Pu),\n2.3 a.u. (Co) and 2.3 a.u. (Ga). The parameter R \u00d7 Kmax = 10.2 determined the basis set size,\nand the Brillouin zone (BZ) sampling was performed with 1152 k points. The self-consistent\nprocedure defined by Eqs. (9)\u2013(12) is repeated until the convergence of the f -manifold occupation nf is better than 0.01.\nThe resulting f -orbital DOS (or, the one-particle spectral function) is shown in Fig. 4a of\nthe main text. The DOS below EF is in reasonably good agreement with Ref. [26]. Above EF ,\nthe DOS obtained here differs somewhat from the DOS reported in Ref. [26] for a reason which\nis unclear at the moment. We estimate the electronic specific heat coefficient using the formula\n\u03b3=\n\n\u03c02 2\nk\n3 B\n\nTr[N(EF )(1 \u2212\n\nd\u03a3(\u03c9)\n)|\u03c9=0 ]\nd\u03c9\n\nand we get \u2248 40 mJ K\u22122 mol\u22121 which is smaller than the\n\nexperimentally estimated value of 80\u2013100 mJ K\u22122 mol\u22121 . Note that a possible enhancement of\n20\n\n\f\u03b3 due to the electron-phonon interaction is not taken into account.\nNow we discuss the magnetic properties. The ground state of the cluster formed by the\nf shell and the bath, Eq. (8), is a singlet (S = L = J = 0) that includes hnf i = 5.30 in the\nf shell, and hnbath i = 8.70 in the bath states. The spin S = 2.18, orbital L = 4.05 and total\n\nJ = 2.43 moments are calculated for the f shell from the expectation values hX\u0302 2 i = X(X + 1),\nX = S, L, J. The individual components of the moments vanish, h\u015cz i = hL\u0302z i = 0, unless the\nsymmetry is broken by an external magnetic field. We carry out calculations with a small\nexternal magnetic field added to Eq. (8) in order to estimate the local f -shell susceptibility.\nThese calculations yield \u2248 0.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03bcB /T which is somewhat smaller than the experimental\nvalue 0.74 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03bcB /T [27].\n\nQualitatively, the non-magnetic character of the composite electron cluster is linked to the\nmixed-valence nature of the Pu atom. The fluctuating local moment is compensated by corresponding dynamical fluctuations of the bath moment. The magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 \u223c\n\n1\n(T +Tf c )\n\nis anticipated, similar to a Kondo-singlet state, which remains constant for T << Tf c , as observed experimentally [27]. Note that neither the admixture of atomic-like f 5 and f 6 multiplets\nnor the Kondo-like screening of the f 5 state localized moment [28] by the bath alone are sufficient to form a singlet ground state of the composite cluster formed by the f-shell and the bath.\nWhen the hybridization is set to zero in Eq. (8) (LDA+Hubbard-I approximation [29]) the\nresulting mixed-valence solution with hnf i = 5.3 is not a singlet and the f-shell stays magnetic.\n\nOn the other hand, when we force f 5 solution in Eq. (8) and keep hybridization unchanged,\n\nthe ground state of the composite electron cluster is not in a singlet either. In this sense, the\nadmixture of the non-magnetic f 6 to the magnetic f 5 state enhances the dynamical screening\nof the local moment by the bath.\nComparison of theoretical and experimental PE spectra represents an important criterion\nof soundness of the electronic structure calculations. The use of the single-particle LDA DOS\nto compare with the PE spectrum is justified only in case of weak electron correlations among\nthe 5f states. For the 5f states at the borderline between the localized and itinerant behavior\nneither the LDA nor the static-mean-field LDA+U theories are sufficient to accurately describe\nthe PE since these approximations entirely miss the experimentally observed atomic-like multiplets. In Fig. 8 we show the total DOS for PuCoGa5 as provided by our LDA+ED calculations.\nOverall, the agreement with the experimental PE data [30] is improved over LDA+Hubbard-I\ncalculations reported earlier [29].\n21\n\n\fNow we discuss the static band-structure resulting from the solutions of Eq. (12). In fact,\nas it can be seen from Fig. 9 (upper panel), near EF it is very similar to the static band\nstructure obtained from LDA+HIA calculations [29]. The corresponding quasi-particle Fermi\nsurfaces (FS) from Ref. [29] are shown in the lower panel of Fig. 9. There are four sheets (I\u2013IV)\ncomposing the FS: sheets I and II are fairly three-dimensional and sheets III and IV are twodimensional. Close similarities are revealed between these sheets and the Fermi surfaces from\nthe previous LDA [23] and AMF-LDA+U calculations. As it was already noticed in Ref. [29],\nFS calculated with LDMA and LDA have very similar geometry.\nq\nNow we calculate the Drude plasma energy, \u03a9p = 13 \u03a92x + 31 \u03a92y + 13 \u03a92z where the individual\ndirectional components \u03a9i are given by\n\u03a92i\n\ne2\n= 2\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nBZ\n\n\u0001\nd3 k vi2 \u03b4 E(k) \u2212 EF ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhich leads to numerical value of \u03a9p = 3.8 eV, as in previous LDA+HIA calculations [29].\nEventually, it leads to the same estimate for the electron-phonon coupling \u03bbtr \u2248 2.5 from the\nBloch\u2013Gr\u00fcneisen transport theory.\nIn addition, we can estimate the type of the magnetic instability, ferro- or antiferromagnetic,\nfor the band structure in Fig. 9. The paramagnetic susceptibility \u03c70 (q, \u03c9) in the limit of small\nq and \u03c9 can be expanded [31] as \u03c70 (q, \u03c9) = N(EF ) \u2212 aq 2 + \u0131b \u03c9q . In a simplified form [32], the\ncoefficient a is proportional to a second derivative\n\nd2 \u03a92p (E)\n|E=EF\nd2 E\n\nof the Drude plasma energy. The\n\nsign of this derivative indicates the type of magnetic instability. A positive sign corresponds to\nq = 0 ferromagnetic fluctuations, whereas a negative sign to q 6= 0 antiferromagnetic (or spinspiral) fluctuations. In Table II we show the second derivative of \u03a9P (E) for all four FS bands\ncalculated from cubic polynomial fits. Our estimate points to FS-II as a suitable candidate for\nq 6= 0 antiferromagnetic instability. The electrons at FS-II, at least in principle, can be paired\nby anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations.\nIt is also to note that the shape of FS shown in the lower panel of Fig. 9 suggests a possibility\nof nesting between the hole-like FS-1 around the \u0393 = (0, 0, 0) point and electron-like FS-3\naround the M = (\u03c0, \u03c0, 0) point. This large q \u223c (\u03c0, \u03c0, 0) nesting-like feature can lead to a\npeak in the spin susceptibility, and promote the anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations to develop.\nThis suggest similarities between the coupling mechanisms for the high-Tc superconductivity\nin PuCoGa5 and Fe-based superconductors [33].\n\n22\n\n\fTABLE II: The total DOS(EF ) in eV\u22121 , Drude plasma energy (eV), and its second derivative over\nenergy at EF\nFS-I FS-II FS-III FS-IV\nDOS(EF ) (1/eV) 0.7\n\u03a9p (EF ) (eV)\nd2 \u03a92p (EF )\nd2 EF\n\nIV.\n\n1.1\n\n1.3\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\n2.7\n\n1.9\n\n1.5\n\n49.71 -221.14 72.0\n\n193.7\n\nCHARACTERIZATION OF THE INVESTIGATED SAMPLES\n\nThe samples used for these experiments have been characterized by magnetic susceptibility\nand electrical resistivity measurements, using commercial Quantum Design platforms (MPMS\n7-T SQUID, and PPMS-9T).\n\n239\n\nPuCoGa5 single crystals have been submitted to a thermal\n\ntreatment to anneal the self-radiation damage. Fig. 10 shows the temperature dependence\nof the electrical resistivity measured for one of these crystals immediately after a thermal\ntreatment. All the samples exhibited a critical temperature very close to the optimal value Tc\n= 18.5 K. Point Contact Andreev Reflection Spectroscopy (PCARS) measurements were started\nwithin one day from the thermal treatment. PCARS measurements have also been performed\non 242 PuCoGa5 crystals featuring a lower Tc =14.5 K, due to the presence of Sb impurities (less\nthan 1 %). The results obtained for these samples are presented in the following section.\n\nV.\n\nPCARS MEASUREMENTS ON SAMPLES WITH Tc =14.5 K\n\nThe point contacts were made on the side surface of the crystals so as to inject the current\nmainly along the ab planes. Unlike in the purest samples, here we used a small spot of Ag\nconducting paste between the Au wire and the sample to act as the N electrode and also to\nmechanically stabilize the contacts. Fig. 11a shows a series of conductance curves measured\nas a function of temperature in a contact with RN = 6.9\u03a9. The curves are vertically offset for\nclarity; as in the cases discussed for the sample with Tc = 18.5 K, there is no shift of the tails\non increasing temperature.\nFig. 11b reports the normalized low-temperature conductance of the same contact (top)\nand that of a different contact with a higher RN =18.8 \u03a9 (bottom). The experimental data\n(symbols) are compared against the relevant 2D-BTK fit (lines). It is worth noting that these\n23\n\n\fcurves (and all the curves obtained in crystals with reduced Tc ) show a small Andreev signal,\nwhose amplitude is similar to that observed in CeCoIn5 [34, 35]. It seems however logical, in\nthis case, to ascribe the small signal to the greater amount of disorder in the samples (and thus\nalso on the surface) with respect to the purest crystals, rather than to intrinsic phenomena\nas proposed in [36]. The small amplitude and the consequent absence of very clear structures\nresult in a greater uncertainty on the fitting parameters, since different sets of parameters can\ngive equally good fits. Moreover, the fit requires a large \u0393 (although still smaller than \u2206). As\nan alternative, and according to [36], one could assume that a fraction of the injected current\ntunnel into a non-superconducting band or set of states, and does not contribute to Andreev\nreflection. In the latter case, the values of \u0393 would be smaller but an additional parameter\nwould be necessary.\nFig. 11c shows an example of temperature dependence of the gap extracted from the fit\n(symbols). The line is the curve calculated within the Eliashberg theory, by using the same\nspectral function and coupling constant as for the sample with Tc = 18.5 K. The different Tc\nand the different gap amplitude arise only from the larger value of the quasiparticle scattering\nrate \u03b3d included in the Eliashberg equations to account for the disorder. Incidentally, while\nTc = 18.5 K is obtained by using \u03b3d = 0.25 meV, the reduced Tc = 14.5 K of this particular\ncontact requires \u03b3d = 1.6 meV. Note that also the gap ratio 2\u2206/kB Tc = 6.2 \u00b1 0.4 is compatible\nwith that obtained in the purest crystals.\n\n[1] Blonder, G. E., Tinkham, M., Klapwijk, T.
