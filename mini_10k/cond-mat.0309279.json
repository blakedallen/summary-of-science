INTRODUCTION\n\nStochastic resonance (SR) has attracted considerable attention of many researchers during the last quarter century [1\u20137]. At first SR was proposed to explain the observed periodicities in global climate dynamics [1]. SR occurs when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for\nthe response of a single nonlinear system to a subthreshold sinusoidal input signal has its\nmaximum at a nonzero noise strength D. As well-known, the SR effect is understood as\nenhancement of the system input to a subthreshold input signal by addition of noise.\nThere are many studies on SR for a single element. For example Gammaitoni et al.\nshowed with SNR that a subthreshold sinusoidal signal to a single threshold element is\noptimally transduced by appropriate additive noise [8]. Collins et al. also reported that a\nsingle neuron can optimally transmit a slowly varying subthreshold aperiodic signal with the\naid of appropriate additive noise [9]. They proposed the power norm C0 and the normalized\npower norm C1 in order to measure a correlation between the input signal and the output\nsignal and showed that both C0 and C1 monmonotonically vary with increasing the noise\nstrength. It is known as aperiodic stochastic resonance (ASR).\nMany researchers have both experimentally and numerically studied the symmetrical\nstochastic resonator such as the Schmitt trigger [10\u201313]. In recent years, the central attention\nof SR seems to move to a network of the stochastic resonators, instead of a single stochastic\nresonator, such as the global coupled networks and linear chains [14,15]. In more recent\nyears a parallel array of nonlinear elements gathers a lot of attention, where the parallel\narray means that the nonlinear elements are connected in parallel and convergent on a\nsumming center [6,16,17].\nRecently Stocks studied the parallel array of the nonlinear devices and reported that\nthe suprathreshold stochastic resonance (SSR) can be observed on these array motivated by\napplications to signal processing [6]. Also from the standpoint of neurophysiology Collins et\nal. and Chialvo et al. studied an parallel array of noisy neurons can exhibit ASR for slowly\nvarying signal [16,17]. Consequently it is important to consider the parallel array in both\n2\n\n\fsignal processing and neurophysiology.\nThe main focus of the article is to find an optimal threshold to transmit an arbitrary\nsignal on the parallel array of the bithreshold elements. According to the assumption that the\namplitude of the input signal is smaller than the standard deviation of the noises we derive\nan analytical approximation of the normalized power norm. Under this assumption it is not\nnecessary to distinguish between subthreshold and suprathreshold. Furthermore we apply\nthe linear response theory to the system that we consider in the article. The fundamental\nidea is the noise-induced linearization, which is an effect that an ensemble average of output\nfrom a nonlinear system is linearized due to noise [19]. From the theoretical approximation\nof the normalized power norm we show that there exists the optimal threshold to maximize\nit.\nIn fact Stocks and Mannella numerically showed that for a summing network of FitzHughNagumo equations adjusting the threshold to maximize information transmission does not\nremove SR effects. They pointed out that there is a optimal threshold to maximize the\nmutual information [18]. Our result is consistent with their indication.\nThe article is organized as follows. In Sec. II we show the array of bithreshold units. It\nis well-known that Schmitt trigger is a prototype of bithreshold devices [10]. In Sec. III we\ntheoretically derive an approximation of the normalized power norm under the assumption\nthat the norm of the input signal is smaller than the additive noise. Utilizing the approximation we find an optimal threshold where the normalized power norm is maximized. In\nSec. IV we perform numerical simulations for the model and show that the threshold value\nat the maximum normalized power norm depends on the variance of the additive noises.\nSec. V is devoted to concluding remarks.\n\nII. MODEL\n\nFigure 1 displays noisy bithreshold elements connected in parallel and convergent on\na summing center. s(tj ), which is sampled with a sampling period T , namely, tj = jT\n3\n\n\f(j = 0, 1, 2, . . .), represents a weak aperiodic signal fluctuating around 0 with xi (tj ) and\nyi (tj ) denoting the input to and output from the ith subsystem, respectively. The input to\nthe bithreshold element is transmitted over noisy channel. Hence the input to the subsystem\nis expressed as\nxi (tj ) = s(tj ) + \u03bei (tj ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bei (tj ) (j = 0, 1, 2, . . .) is independently sampled from the Gaussian distribution,\npi (\u03be) = \u221a\n\n\u0010 \u03be2 \u0011\n1\n,\nexp \u2212\n2Di\n2\u03c0Di\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Di > 0 are the variance of \u03bei (tj ). Each bithreshold element is symmetric and has\nthree output values. It is formalized by\n\nyi (tj ) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n1\n\n(xi (tj ) > \u039bi )\n\n0\n\n(\u2212\u039bi \u2264 xi (tj ) \u2264 \u039bi ) ,\n\n(3)\n\n\u22121 (xi (tj ) < \u2212\u039bi )\n\nwhere \u039bi > 0 are threshold values.\n\nThe system output through the summing center YN (tj ) is defined as,\nYN (tj ) =\n\nN\n1 X\nyi (tj ),\nN i=1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere N is the number of the subsystems. Without noises, each input xi (tj ) cannot cross the\nthreshold value, leading to the system output YN (tj ) = 0. With noises having an appropriate\nvariance, xi (tj ) can cross the threshold value.\n\nIII. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS\n\nWe consider the ith bithreshold subsystem. Let P+ (tj ), P\u2212 (tj ) and P0 (tj ) be probabilities that yi (tj ) takes 1, \u22121 and 0, respectively. For an arbitrary input signal s(tj ) these\nprobabilities are given by,\n\n4\n\n\f\u0010 \u039b \u2212 s(t ) \u0011\n1\ni\nj\nP+ (tj ) = erfc \u221a\n,\n2\n2Di\n\u0010 \u039b + s(t ) \u0011\n1\ni\nj\nP\u2212 (tj ) = erfc \u221a\n,\n2\n2Di\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nP0 (tj ) = 1 \u2212 P+ (tj ) \u2212 P\u2212 (tj ),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere erfc(x) is the complementary error function, which is defined as,\n2\nerfc(x) = \u221a\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\nx\n\n2\n\ne\u2212u du.\n\n(8)\n\nFor simplicity we set \u039bi = \u039b and Di = D for all the subsystems. From Eqs. (5), (6) and\n(7) we introduce \u03bb =\n\n\u221a\u039b\nD\n\nand \u03b6(tj ) =\n\ns(tj )\n\u221a .\nD\n\nThe input signal is subthreshold when \u03b6(tj ) < \u03bb\n\nand suprathreshold when \u03b6(tj ) > \u03bb.\nFrom Eqs. (4), (5), (6) and (7) the ensemble average of YN (tj ) is calculated as\nhYN (tj )i =\n\n\u03bb + \u03b6(tj ) o\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03b6(tj )\n1n\n) \u2212 erfc( \u221a\n) .\nerfc( \u221a\n2\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\nTaylor expansion of Eq. (9) around \u03b6(tj ) = 0 yields\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nhYN (tj )i \u2248 G(\u03bb)\u03b6(tj ) + O \u03b6(tj )3 ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere G(\u03bb) represents the first order coefficient, which is given by\n\u2202\nG(\u03bb) =\nhYN (tj )i|\u03b6(tj )=0 =\n\u2202\u03b6\n\ns\n\n2 \u2212 \u03bb2\ne 2.\n\u03c0\n\n(11)\n\nThus Eq. (10) shows that hYN (tj )i is a linear function of the input signal \u03b6(tj ) for h|\u03b6|i \u226a 1,\nwhere h|\u03b6|i is the norm of the input signal, measured by the average of the amplitude of the\nsignal. We call G(\u03bb) in Eq. (10) \"gain\".\nNow in order to measure correlation between the input signal s(tj ) and the output signal\nYN (tj ) we introduce the normalized power norm [9]\nC1 =\n\nC0\n[s(tj )2 ]1/2 [(YN (tj ) \u2212 YN (tj ))2 ]1/2\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere C0 is defined as\nC0 = s(tj )YN (tj ),\n5\n\n(13)\n\n\fwith the overbar denoting an average over time,\nM\n1 X\ns(tj )YN (tj ).\ns(tj )YN (tj ) = lim\nM \u2192\u221e M\nj=1\n\n(14)\n\nMaximizing C1 corresponds to maximizing the coherence between s(tj ) and YN (tj ), namely,\nit is equivalent to maximizing information transmission through the devices in Fig. 1.\nAt first we discuss the numerator of Eq. (12). For large N YN (tj ) asymptotically tends\nto hYN (tj )i according to the law of large number. From Eq. (10) the power norm C0 is\ncalculated as,\nG(\u03bb)\nC0 \u2248 \u221a ||s||2,\nD\nwhere ||s|| is define as\na given input signal.\n\n(15)\n\nq\n\ns(tj )2 , namely, the power norm is proportional to the gain G(\u03bb) for\n\nNext we consider the denominator of Eq. (12). For the purpose we introduce \u03b7(tj ) \u2261\nhYN (tj )i \u2212 YN (tj ) we have h\u03b7(tj )i = 0 and\n\u2206j \u2261 h\u03b7 2 (tj )i = = h[YN (tj ) \u2212 hYN (tj )i]2 i\n= hYN2 (tj )i \u2212 hYN (tj )i2\n=\n\no\n1n\nP+ (tj ) + P\u2212 (tj ) \u2212 (P+ (tj ) \u2212 P\u2212 (tj ))2 .\nN\n\nYN (tj ) is distributed around the ensemble average hYN (tj )i, and\nSubstituting Eqs.

(18) results from a fluctuation of the output signal YN (tj ) without the\ninput signal.\nNow we consider (YN (tj ) \u2212 YN (tj ))2 ,\n\ncalculated as follows [17].\n\nWe have\n\n2\n\n(YN (tj ) \u2212 YN (tj ))2 = YN (tj )2 YN (tj ) . Since we consider a zero-mean input signal YN (tj ) = 0.\nFrom YN (tj ) = hYN (tj )i + \u03b7(tj ) we have\nYN (tj )2 = hYN (tj )i2 + 2hYN (tj )i\u03b7(tj ) + \u03b7(tj )2\n= hYN (tj )i2 + \u2206j ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere we use hYN (tj )i\u03b7(tj ) = 0, which is proven by employing an ergodic assumption. Hence\nfrom Eqs. (13) and (19) C1 is expressed by\nG(\u03bb)||s||2\n\nC1 =\n\nq\n\n||s|| D(hYN (tj )i2 + \u2206j )\n1\n\n=r\n1+\n\n\u2206j\nhYN (tj )i2\n\n1\n=q\n,\n1 + c\u22121\n1\n\n(20)\n\nwhere c1 denotes the ratio between hYN (tj )i2 and the variance \u2206j :\nc1 =\n\nhYN (tj )i2\n.\n\u2206j\n\n(21)\n\nThis statistical measure, which is dimensionless and independent of scale, is the squared\nreciprocal of the coefficient of variation. High c1 indicates low variability of the output\nsignal. If hYN (tj )i is approximated by the first term of Eq. (10), and \u2206j the first term of\nEq. (18), we obtain\nc1 =\n\n2N exp(\u2212\u03bb2 )\n\u0010 \u0011 ||\u03b6||2,\n\u03c0 erfc \u221a\u03bb\n2\n\n(22)\n\n\u221a\nwhere ||\u03b6|| = ||s||/ D. From Eq. (20) it is clear that C1 is maximized when c1 is maximize.\nMoreover from Eq. (22) it is easily confirmed that c1 is maximized at \u03bb \u2248 0.63, so that 0.63\nis the optimal threshold.\n7\n\n\fIn order to infer the input signal s(tj ) from the output signal YN (tj ) it is necessary that\nhYN (tj )i is sufficiently larger than the fluctuation of YN (tj ). If we impose the condition\n\u221a\nc1 > 1, i.e., C1 > 1/ 2 we have\n||\u03b6|| >\n\nr\n\n\u03c0\n2N\n\ns\n\n\u0010 \u03bb \u0011\n\u0010 \u03bb2 \u0011\n.\nerfc \u221a exp\n2\n2\n\nThis inequality assures that we can infer the input signal s(tj ) from\n\n(23)\n\u221a\n\nDYN (tj )\nG(\u03bb)\n\n\u221a\nfor C1 > 1 2.\n\nIV. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\n\nFigure 2 displays the normalized power norm C1 drawn as a function of \u03bb at fixed ||\u03b6||\nfrom direct numerical simulations of the array of the bithreshold elements at N = 100.\nThe input signal is given by s(tj ) = 0.5A sin(2\u03c0f tj ) + A cos(4\u03c0f tj ) + 0.25A sin(8\u03c0f tj ) at\nq\n\u221a\nA/ D. The points are obtained from\nf = 10.0 and T = 0.001, where ||\u03b6|| is given by 21\n32\nthe numerical simulations for various \u03bb at ||\u03b6|| = 1, 0.1 and 0.01, respectively. The curves\n\nrepresent Eq. (20) at the same parameters as the numerical simulations. It is found that the\nresults from the numerical simulations is well fitted by the theoretical relation for ||\u03b6|| = 0.1\nand 0.01. C1 has it maximum at \u03bb = 0.63.\nHowever for ||\u03b6|| = 1 it differs from the theoretical equation. The reason is because the\noutput signal YN (tj ) is not well approximated by the linear response of the input signal s(tj )\ndue to the limit of applying the linear response theory. This disagreement is originated from\ndifference between the nonlinear response of the system and the linear response assumed in\nSec. III.\nWe demonstrate the output signal YN (tj ) for various \u03bb = 0.63, 1.5 and 3.0 as shown\nin Fig. 3. The output signal YN (tj ) is similar to the input signal s(tj ) in the order for \u03bb\nshown. In this demonstration the input signal is given by a periodic signal. Naturally the\ntheoretical equation of C1 which we obtained is applicable to any input signal (of course an\naperiodic signal) satisfied with ||\u03b6|| < 1. Specifically when the input signal is satisfied with\nEq. (23) the output signal gives a good approximation of the input signal at \u03bb = 0.63.\n8\n\n\fV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have investigated the parallel array of bithreshold elements both theoretically and\nnumerically. We give an analytical approximation of the normalized power norm C1 under\nthe assumption that the norm of the input signal s(tj ) is smaller than the standard deviation\nof the additive noises without distinguishing between subthreshold input and suprathreshold\ninput. We confirmed that the theoretical approximation of C1 is consistent with the results\nobtained from the direct numerical simulations of the array of the bithreshold elements\nwhen the norm of the input signal is smaller than the standard deviation of the additive\nnoises. While for the larger norm than the standard deviation the difference between the\napproximation and the numerical results appears. This disagreement is originated from the\nnonlinear response of the system. We demonstrated that the output signal gives a good\napproximation of the input signal at an appropriate threshold. We clarify that the optimal\nthreshold, where the normalized power norm has a maximum value, is given by 0.63 times\nthe standard deviation of the noises.\nOur study may be applied to a sophisticated array of amplifiers. Moreover the result\nshows that a collection of simple bithreshold sensors can detect a weak signal under an\nindependently noisy environment.\n\n9\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] R. Benzi, S. Sutera, and A.
