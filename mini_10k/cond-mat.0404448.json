When a continuous wave radiation is in resonance\nwith the transitions from the ground state to the first excited state, the equilibrium\nmagnetization exhibits a dip. The position of this dip varies linearly with the radiation\nfrequency. Our results provide a lower bound of 0.17 ns for transverse relaxation time\nand suggest the possibility that single-molecule magnets might be utilized for quantum\ncomputation.\n\nPACS Code: 75.50.Xx, 61.46.+w, 67.57.Lm, 75.45.+j\n\n1\n\n\fSingle-molecule magnets lie at the frontier between the quantum and classical worlds.\nLike classical magnets used for magnetic storage, they are bistable, exhibiting hysteresis\nat low temperatures [1,2]. However, they also exhibit striking quantum mechanical\nproperties such as tunneling between \"up\" and \"down\" orientations [3-5] as well as a\ngeometric-phase effect created by the interference between tunneling paths [6]. Recent\nexperiments show that the rate for magnetization reversal can be augmented using\nmicrowave radiation [7,8]. Here we demonstrate a novel method of reversing the\nmagnetization of a system of single-molecule magnets in which radiation at a resonant\nfrequency induces a partial population inversion. These results open up the possibility\nthat single-molecule magnets can be used for magnetic storage and as qubits [9], the\nprocessing elements in quantum computers.\n\nThe single-molecule magnet Fe8O2(OH)12(tacn)6 (heretofore called Fe8) is composed of\neight magnetic Fe(III) ions strongly coupled together to form a single spin-10 system.\nThe molecules crystallize into a triclinic lattice and have a large biaxial\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy. Reversal of the magnetization from one easy-axis\ndirection to another is impeded by a ~25 K barrier [5], suggesting a double-well model of\nthe system's energy, as illustrated in Fig. 1, where the left (right) well corresponds to the\nspin pointing along (antiparallel to) the easy axis. The potential contains a series of\nenergy levels that roughly correspond to different orientations of the magnetic moment.\nA magnetic field applied along the easy axis tilts the potential, favoring, e.g., the spin-up\norientation. At certain values of magnetic field, levels in opposite wells will align,\n\n2\n\n\fpermitting resonant tunneling between up and down states, a phenomenon first\ndiscovered in the material Mn12 acetate [3].\n\nThe system can be described by an effective spin Hamiltonian\n\nr r\nH = \u2212 DS z2 + E ( S x2 \u2212 S y2 ) + C ( S+4 + S\u22124 ) \u2212 g \u03bc B S \u22c5 H ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the anisotropy constants D, E, and C are 0.292 K, 0.046 K, and -2.9 x 10-5 K,\nrespectively, and g = 2 [6,10,11]. The first (and largest) term causes the spin to prefer to\nlie along or opposite the z axis, resulting in the double-well potential of Fig. 1, and\nmaking the energy levels in Fig. 1 approximately the eigenstates of Sz. The second and\nthird terms break the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian and result in tunneling\nbetween the otherwise unperturbed states. When the magnetic field H is in the x-z plane,\nthe Zeeman term can be rewritten as\n\nr r\ng \u03bc B S \u22c5 H = g \u03bc B H ( S z cos \u03b8 + S x sin \u03b8 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between the spin S and the external magnetic field H. (In the\nexperiments the field is actually ~17o out of the x-z plane [12], but this fact has only\nminor effects on the results presented.)\n\n3\n\n\fWe mounted a single crystal of Fe8 on a Hall-bar detector with its easy axis tilted ~33(1)o\nin the a-b plane from the field direction [12]. A component of the field perpendicular to\nthe easy (z) axis enhances tunneling. The sample was irradiated with monochromatic\nmicrowaves. We measured the steady-state magnetization of the sample as a function of\nmagnetic field both with and without the presence of radiation. (Since the radiation also\nheats the sample somewhat, we took great care to measure the magnetization curve in the\nabsence of radiation at the same temperature as when the sample is irradiated. We could\ndetermine the temperature of the sample to within 1 mK from the magnetic relaxation\nrate measured with AC susceptibility when the DC magnetic field is far from the\nresonance peaks shown in Fig. 2. The relaxation rate, the frequency at which the inphase component of the susceptibility inflects, is exponentially sensitive to changes in\ntemperature). After subtracting the two curves we obtain \u2206M, the radiation-induced\nchange in magnetization, as a function of magnetic field.\n\nFig. 2 shows \u2206M as a function of field for several frequencies of radiation. Each curve\nshows that the radiation induces a change in the sample's magnetization at certain values\nof magnetic field. At these fields, the frequency of the radiation matches the energy\ndifference between the lowest two levels in, e.g., the right well in Fig. 1, resulting in the\nabsorption of a photon and subsequent thermal or tunneling relaxation (or a combination\nof both) into the left well. We find that the magnitude of the magnetization change is\nlargest when the first excited state in the right well is near a tunneling resonance with a\nlevel in the opposite well, as in Fig. 2a. This indicates that the photon-induced reversal\nprocess can be enhanced by tunneling, consistent with the relaxation results of Sorace et\n4\n\n\fal [8]. Our results show magnetization reversal even when levels in opposite wells are far\nfrom resonance, when tunneling is effectively nil. In this case, the radiation produces a\nnonthermal population in the first excited state in the right well. Thermal phonons then\nproduce transitions between levels until a quasi-equilibrium is established, resulting in an\nincreased population in the left well.\n\nSome of our data show an asymmetry between peaks in negative field and those at\npositive field, as in Fig. 2a. We attribute this to elliptical polarization of the radiation\nproduced by mode mixing in our waveguide. The asymmetry only affects the height of\nthe peaks, but not their position.\n\nThe Zeeman term in the Hamiltonian implies that the energy difference between levels\nshould vary linearly with external field. In Fig. 3 we plot the field at which\nmagnetization reversal occurs as a function of microwave frequency (using the data\nshown in Fig. 2 and similar curves at other frequencies). We indeed obtain a linear\ndependence. The straight solid line in the figure results from numerically calculating the\nenergy difference between the lowest two levels using the accepted Hamiltonian and\nanisotropy constants and setting \u03b8 = 34o, a value that gives a good fit to the data and is\nalso in agreement with the directly measured angle between the sample's easy axis and\nthe field direction.\n\n5\n\n\fWe numerically modeled our results by constructing a master rate equation that includes\nthe spin-phonon transitions as well as photon-induced transitions. To do this, we first\ndiagonalized the Hamiltonian, Eq. (1), and used the energy eigenstates as the basis for\nour master equation. Using this basis simplifies calculations, although it treats resonant\ntunneling as coherent. Since neither the experiment nor the calculations are done when\nthe system is tuned precisely to resonance, the unphysical assumption of coherence does\nnot present a problem.\n\nThe master rate equation we solved numerically is\n\n21\n21\ndPi\n1+\n1\u2212\n2+\n2\u2212\n1+\n1\u2212\n2+\n2\u2212\n= \u2212 \u2211(\u03b3 i , j + \u03b3 i, j + \u03b3 i, j + \u03b3 i, j + wi, j )Pi + \u2211 (\u03b3 i, j + \u03b3 i , j + \u03b3 i, j + \u03b3 i, j + wi, j )Pj , (3)\ndt\nj=1\nj =1\ni\u2260 j\n\ni\u2260 j\n\nwhere Pi is the population of the energy eigenstate i with energy \u03b5 i .

The spin-phonon coupling\nconstant go was determined empirically by fitting AC susceptibility data (not shown).\n\nThe radiation-induced transition rates are similarly calculated using a standard expression\nfrom electron spin resonance [14]:\n\nwi , j\n\n( H g\u03bc )\n= 1 B\n2h\n\n2\n\n2\n\ni cos \u03b1 S x + i sin \u03b1 S y j\n\n2\n\nT2\n\n\u239b\n(\u03b5 i \u2212 \u03b5 j ) \u239f\u239e T 2\n1 + \u239c 2\u03c0\u03bd \u2212\n\u239c\n\u239f 2\nh\n\u239d\n\u23a0\n2\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere H1 is the magnitude of the radiative magnetic field and T2 is the spin's transverse\nrelaxation time. The ellipticity of the radiation is defined as tan \u03b1 .\n\nTo find the steady-state magnetization in the presence of radiation, we numerically solve\nthe 21 equations implicit in Eq. (3), setting the left side of each to be zero to determine\neq\n\neach Pi , the equilibrium population of level i . From this we solved for the\n\nmagnetization M using\n\n7\n\n\f21\n\nM=\u2211\ni=1\n\nr\nr H\neq\ni S \u22c5 r i Pi ,\nH\n\n(7)\n\nr\nr H\nwhere S \u22c5 r is the spin operator along the external field direction.\nH\n\nIn our calculations we fixed the anisotropy parameters to currently accepted values. The\nonly parameters we varied were H1, the magnitude of the radiation field, T2, the spin's\ntransverse relaxation time and (only for the results in Fig. 2a) the ellipticity of the\nradiation. H1 only sets the amplitude of the peaks, while T2 determines the width. The\nellipticity controls the relative height of the two peaks. Our fits determined H1 to be in\nthe range 0.03 \u2013 0.165 Oe, depending on frequency. In our simulations, we used T2 =\n0.17 ns, a value that allowed us to reproduce most of the data curves well. This value is a\nlower bound for T2 since it may reflect the effects of inhomogeneities from dipole fields,\nanisotropy parameters and g factors [15-17]. Our line widths are consistent with those\nfound spectroscopically by others [18].\n\nOur results suggest that single-molecule magnets can be employed in a novel form of\nmagnetic storage. Instead of using an applied magnetic field to flip a bit, as is done in\nusual forms of magnetic storage, radiation of an appropriate frequency can be used to\ndrive the spin from one orientation to another. In addition, these results have\nimplications for the use of molecular magnets as qubits. By using pulsed radiation,\n\n8\n\n\fsingle- and multiple-qubit operations should be achievable. While there are other\nmagnetic systems in which radiation can change [19] or induce [20] a magnetic state, to\nour knowledge the single-molecule magnets are the only bistable magnetic systems in\nwhich radiation can drive a substantial magnetization change through a quantum resonant\nprocess.\n\nWe thank M.

The left well\ncorresponds to the spin pointing \"up\" and the right corresponds to it pointing\n\"down\". The photon-induced magnetization reversal process is illustrated\nschematically by the arrows. Resonant microwave radiation drives some molecules\nfrom the ground state to the first excited state in the right well (wavy arrow). Some\nof this increased population is distributed to the left well by thermal activation (red\narrows), which involves multiple phonon transitions, tunneling (green arrows),\nwhich is only significant when levels in opposite wells align, or some combination of\nboth.\n\nFigure 2. Photon-induced magnetization change as a function of magnetic field.\nThe induced magnetization change \u2206M is normalized by the saturation\nmagnetization Msat. Microwave frequencies used were a) 120 GHz, b) 117.9 GHz, c)\n115.5 GHz and d) 114 GHz. Peaks/dips occur when the energy between the two\nlowest levels in the right well (Fig. 1) matches the photon energy. The solid curves\nare the results of simulations, as discussed in the text. The asymmetry in peak\nheights in a) can be accounted for by assuming that the radiation is elliptically\npolarized with ellipticity 0.16.\n\nFigure 3. Peak positions versus applied radiation frequency. The fields at which\nphoton-induced magnetization reversal occurs are extracted from the data shown in\n\n12\n\n\fFig.2 (as well as others not shown) and plotted as a function of microwave\nfrequency. The linear dependence derives from the Zeeman term, Eq. 2. The solid\nline is calculated from using the accepted Hamiltonian for the system and setting \u03b8\n= 34o.\n\n13\n\n\fThermal activation\nTunneling\nPhoton-induced\ntransition\n\nFigure 1\n14\n\n\fFigure 2\n\n15\n\n\fFigure 3\n16\n\n\f"}
