Their pc-scale jets can\nbe well imaged by VLBI observations. The \"angular size \u2013\nfrequency\" (\"\u03b8 \u2013 \u03bd\") relation can be used for calibrate the\napparent \"angular size \u2013 redshift\" (\"\u03b8 \u2013 z\") relation in which\nthe radio jets are taken as a \"standard rod\" applicable for\ntesting different cosmological models (Gurvits 2003). The\ndependence of the size on frequency can provide important constraints for studying the internal physical properties\n(Lobanov 1998) and the evolution of jets.\n\nTable 1.

However, when imaged with VLBI at a milliarcsecond resolution, the jet emission often exhibits more complicated spectral shapes, affected by opacity in the emitting\nmaterial itself and in the surrounding medium. The intervening media along the line of sight scatter/absorb the emission\nand distort the image, in particular at low (< 1 GHz) frequencies. Thus, the apparent angular size usually depends\non the observing frequency. The dependence can be written\nphenomenologically as a power-law function \u03b8 \u221d \u03bd n in most\ncases. For instance, n = \u22122 for the compact radio source\nat the center of our Galaxy (Sgr A\u2217 ) as a result of scatter\nbroadening (Shen et al. 2005).\n\n2\n\nTHE CHARACTERISTIC ANGULAR SIZE\n\nThe characteristic angular size is a parameter describing the\nwidth of the intensity distribution of jet emission. Generally, it can be defined either in the image plane or in the u-v\n(Fourier) plane. For instance, a measure of the characteristic\nsize can be provided by the distance between the brightest\ncomponent and the most distant one with the brightness at\nleast 2 % of the peak (Kellermann 1993) in the image plane.\nIt is also feasible to obtain the estimated angular size by fitting a circular Gaussian model to the visibility data (Gurvits\n1994) in the u-v plane. Although the two ways are equivalent in principle, the definitions in the u-v plane are more\n\n\f2\n\nYang et al.\n\nFigure 1. An example for the definition of the characteristic\nangular size. The top panel shows the original visibility data. The\nbottom panel shows the extracted upper envelope points and the\nfitting Gaussian curve.\n\ndirect than those in the image plane, and free from sampling effect. If the visibility data have enough sensitivity, the\n\"super-resolution\" can be obtained for the barely resolved\nsources using a certain model (Lobanov 2005). Here we define the characteristic angular size \u03b8 by fitting the upper\nenvelope of the visibility amplitudes to a circular Gaussian\nmodel (Pearson 1999):\n\u0393(\u03c1) = exp\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2212(\u03c0\u03b8\u03c1)2\n4 ln 2\n\n\u0015\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the full width to half-maximum intensity\n(FWHM) in the image plane in radian, \u03c1 is u-v radius in\nwavelength and \u0393(\u03c1) is the normalized amplitude. The characteristic angular size represents the most compact and the\nbrightest part of the source. Fig. 1 gives an example for the\ndefinition of the characteristic angular size.\n\n3\n\nDATA COLLECTION\n\nTable 1 gives a brief summary of our data set of 4000 objects\ncompiled from several large VLBI surveys (see references\nin Frey 2006). Some sources have multi-frequency and/or\nmulti-epoch observations. All the visibility data have been\ncalibrated, self-calibrated, and saved as standard u-v FITS\nfiles. We developed several programs to automatically calculate the characteristic angular size according to our definition using the IDL Astronomy Users Library. We extracted\nthe upper envelope points from the original visibility data,\nfitted them by a circular Gaussian model, and finally fitted\nthe \"\u03b8 \u2013 \u03bd\" data to a power-law function to determine the\npower index n for the multi-frequency observations.\n\n4\n\nRESULTS\n\nFig. 2 shows the statistical distributions of the characteristic\nangular sizes. The histograms show a similar shape peaking\n\nFigure 2. The statistical distributions of the characteristic angular sizes. Different colors represent different bands. Note that the\nangular size is expressed in units of the resolution of the VLBA\narray at each band.\n\nat the position of \u223c0.4R, where R is the resolution of the\nVLBA array at each band and listed in Column 3, Table 1.\nThe Ku-band distribution is consistent with the previous results in the MOJAVE sample by Kovalev et al. (2005). They\nfitted the core by an elliptical Gaussian model in Difmap.\nFig. 3 shows the distribution of the power index n, which has\na mean value of \u22120.95 \u00b1 0.37 for 2827 sources with at least\ntwo-frequency observations and \u22120.96 \u00b1 0.21 for 315 sources\nwith at least four-frequency observations. The dependence\nagrees well with the results from fitting the core by an elliptical Gaussian model in 167 objects (Jiang et al. 2001) .\nNote that we assume that the power index n is independent\nof redshift within the studied range of redshift (0 < z < 5).\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe upper envelope statistically gives the size of the brightest and most compact component. Among all the components in a pc-scale jet, the core/jet base usually has a flatter spectrum and dominates the total flux density. Thus, the\nupper envelope gives the size of the radio core in most cases.\nThe radio core generally has a flat spectrum and is\nlocated in the region where the optical depth \u03c4 = 1.\nK\u00f6nigl (1981) demonstrated that, due to the synchrotron\nself-absorption, the size of the core rcore varies with the frequency \u03bd as: rcore \u221d \u03bd \u22121/kr , where kr depends on the shape\nof the electron energy spectrum and on the distribution of\nthe magnetic field and particle density in an inhomogeneous\njet, kr = 1 in the case of the equipartition between jet particle and magnetic field energy densities (Lobanov 1998). Our\nresults agree well with this prediction.\nFree-free absorption by the plasma covering the jet also\nresults in an optically thick core. However, free-free absorption is only found in a few sources. Lobanov (1998) suggested\nthat the shift of core position is rcore \u221d \u03bd \u22122.5 for a spherical distribution of free-free absorption plasma Ne \u221d r \u22123 ,\nwhere r is the distance from the center and Ne is the electron number density. So, the free-free absorption is not the\n\n\fThe Apparent \"Angular Size \u2013 Frequency\" Dependence in \u223c3000 Parsec-scale Extragalactic Jets\n\n3\n\nRadio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National\nScience Foundation operated under cooperative agreement\nby associated Universities, Inc.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFigure 3.

It might however happen in some sources. As far as\nthe simple diffractive scattering models, e.g. the Gaussian\nscreen model or the power-law model with the Kolmogorov\nspectrum, are concerned, they result in a dependence with\nn \u2264 \u22122 (Thompson et al. 1986), which is fairly far from the\npeak (n \u223c \u22120.9) of the obtained distribution. Thus, simple\nscatter broadening cannot explain the dependence.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBased on the above discussion, we can draw the following\nconclusions.\n(i) The upper envelope of visibility amplitudes is a statistically meaningful characteristic angular size for the radio\n\"core\".\n(ii) The apparent \"angular size \u2013 frequency\" dependence\ncan be statistically described by \u03b8 \u221d \u03bd \u22120.95\u00b10.37 in \u223c3000\npc-scale jets.\n(iii) The observed frequency dependence can be explained\nas a result of synchrotron self-absorption in the inhomogeneous jet. The simple scatter broadening and free-free absorption can be ruled out as dominant mechanisms responsible for the dependence.\n\n7\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nJ.
