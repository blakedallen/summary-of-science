In view of the fact that the behavior encountered often differs strongly from systems governed\nby statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, there is\nlittle by way of intuitive help from such theories in trying\nto understand granular matter, both at rest and in motion. Segregation is perhaps the most prominent of these\nfeatures; the ability of noncohesive granular mixtures to\nsegregate into individual species, despite the absence of\nany obvious entropic or energetic benefit, makes this a\nparticularly fascinating phenomenon.\nGranular separation and mixing are central to many\nkinds of industrial processing that span a broad range of\nsize scales; the capability for either causing or preventing\nsegregation can be central to the viability of a particular\nprocess. Substantial economic benefits could be gained\nfrom a systematic understanding of the complexities of\ngranular flow at a level similar to fluid dynamics; the\noutcome would be improved control, reliability and efficiency, a notable advance over currently used approaches\nthat are often empirical. Analogous segregation processes\noccur in nature, where an understanding of the underlying mechanisms might benefit resource management.\nConsequently, considerable effort has been invested in\nexploring these phenomena, but, absent a general theory of granular matter, much of the progress in this field\n[1, 2, 3, 4] relies on computer simulation.\nThere are a variety of conditions under which granular\nmixtures segregate; these include shear [5, 6], vibration\n[7, 8, 9] and rotation [10, 11, 12]. Experiments on rotational segregation, one of the more extensively studied\nsystems experimentally and the subject of the present paper, employ a horizontal cylinder revolving at constant\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: rapaport@mail.biu.ac.il\n\nrate and partially filled with a mixture of two species of\ngranular particles. Given the appropriate kinds of particles, and under suitable conditions, the mixture spontaneously segregates into axial bands of alternating composition. A substantial body of experimental data has\nbeen assembled, but because of the numerous parameters entering the experiment only a limited portion of\nthe multidimensional phase diagram has been explored.\nThe relevant parameters include the nature of the granular particles themselves, ranging from the most familiar\nforms of granular matter such as sand, through various\norganic products, plastic and glass beads, to metal ball\nbearings. The particles have a broad spectrum of elastic\nand frictional characteristics, and sizes that range over\nseveral orders of magnitude. The material can be in a\ndry or wet state, the latter case known as a slurry. The\ncylinder can have different shapes, most commonly one\nwith a uniform circular cross section. Further parameters\ninclude the cylinder diameter and length, the rotation\nrate, the relative fractions and sizes of the granular components, and the filling level of the container. In marked\ndistinction to fluid systems, there are no known scaling\nrelations that allow this parameter space to be reduced,\nand while some systematic trends have been noted, there\nis little guidance available for predicting the outcome of\nan experiment involving some unexplored combination of\nparameters.\nThe most direct observations address the structure of\nthe upper surface [11], while more elaborate studies examine the interior using, for example, noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [13, 14, 15]. Axial segregation may be complete, with each band composed exclusively of one particle species, or it may be only partial, with bands characterized by higher concentrations\nof alternating species. There is an additional effect that\noccurs entirely beneath the surface leaving little external evidence, namely radial segregation, which produces\na core rich in small particles extending along the length\nof the cylinder. Radial segregation occurs early in experiments starting from a uniformly mixed state, and may\n\n\f2\nor may not persist once axial segregation appears. Axial\nband formation might be regarded as a consequence of\nthis core intermittently bulging by an amount sufficient\nto reach the outer surface [14]. The axial band patterns\ncan also exhibit time dependence; examples of such behavior involve coarsening, in which narrower bands gradually merge into broader bands [16], and the appearance\nof traveling wave patterns on the surface [17, 18]. Further discussion of the experimental history appears in\n[12, 14, 19], but information about this phenomenon still\ncontinues to accumulate. More recent results showing\nthe richness of the segregation effect and its dynamics in\ndry and/or wet mixtures (slurries exhibit behavior that\nis similar in many respects, despite the lubricating role\nof the fluid medium) are described in [20, 21, 22]. The\nproblem can be extended in different directions, for example [23] considers mixtures with three and more granular components. That there is little opportunity for\nscaling to play a role in understanding this phenomenon\nis demonstrated in [24], where the ratio of the cylinder\nand particle diameters determines whether axial segregation occurs and if its appearance depends reversibly on\nrotation rate; the fact that the wavelength of the axial\npattern does not scale with cylinder diameter is described\nin [25].\nGiven the complexity of the experimental situation and\nthe many lacunae in parameter space, it is hardly surprising that theoretical progress has been limited. Continuous one-dimensional models have been developed [26] in\nwhich the dynamical variables are the local concentration\ndifference and the slope of the free surface; these describe\nthe early stages of segregation with traveling bands and\nsubsequent band merging, although experiment [27] has\nquestioned their ability to characterize the process correctly, and the obviously important three-dimensional aspects of the phenomenon are absent. The problem has\nalso been studied using a cellular automata approach\nbased on a highly simplified model [28].\nThe most detailed theoretical approach involves direct\nmodeling of the dynamics of granular particles, employing the same computational methods used in molecular\ndynamics simulation of atomistic systems. While there\nhave been a considerable number of such studies, covering a variety of granular phenomena, there have been\nvery few simulations of granular particles in a revolving\ncylinder exhibiting axial segregation. The first of these\nwas an early, rather limited treatment [29]. This was followed by a broader study [12], that is extended by the\npresent work, in which the formation of multiple axial\nbands was demonstrated, and various aspects of the segregation phenomenon, such as band merging, the absence\nof mixing in presegregated systems, and the manner in\nwhich the behavior depended on the choice of parameters, were investigated. The model differed from that of\nthe present paper in that the transverse restoring force\n(discussed in detail below) was absent and a LennardJones type of normal repulsion was used rather than a\nlinear force. Exactly the same kind of axial band for-\n\nmation was subsequently reported in [30] (although this\nsimilarity was not explicitly noted) using the same kind\nof model, but with the linear force. The appearance of\nradial segregation is described in [31], but only for a twodimensional system.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to analyze a\ndiscrete-particle model that exhibits both axial and radial segregation, in which the appearance of the radial\neffect precedes the axial, and then either disappears or\npersists as an axial core. Experimentally, it is the smaller\nparticles that are found to congregate in the interior, and\nthis feature is reproduced by the simulations; one issue\nthat was not resolved in the earlier study [12] was the\nfact that the opposite behavior was encountered, but it\nwill be shown that this is due to the choice of interparticle forces. The goal here is not a systematic coverage of\nparameter space, since the computational resources for\nthis would be considerable, but rather a demonstration\nof the typical kinds of outcome with just a few examples\nof parameter dependence; indeed, due to a lack of detailed reproducibility under different initial conditions, as\nwill become apparent subsequently, obtaining a comprehensive picture of the \"average\" behavior would require\nmultiple simulation runs for each parameter set. Typically, the majority of runs described here involve larger\nsystems than before, with a bigger particle size difference and a more slowly rotating cylinder; these changes,\ntogether with the additional work required by the force\ncomputations, called for a greater computational effort\nthan previously.\n\nII.\n\nSIMULATION METHODOLOGY\nA.\n\nGranular models\n\nThe models used for granular simulation are generally\nbased on spherical particles whose resistance to overlap\nis expressed in terms of a continuous potential function\n[5, 32, 33]. In addition to this excluded-volume repulsion,\nparticles are subject to forces that aim to replicate the\neffects of inelasticity and friction. There are limitations\nto the accuracy of such models, with one empirical measure of success being the degree to which the essence of\nthe phenomenon under study is captured.\nConsider a pair of granular particles i and j with diameters di and dj , respectively. The repulsive force between\nparticles depends linearly on their overlap,\nfv = kn (dij \u2212 rij ) r\u0302ij ,\n\nrij < dij ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere rij = ri \u2212 rj is the particle separation, rij = |rij |,\nand dij = (di + dj )/2 is the effective diameter. An alternative is the Hertz interaction that depends on the 3/2power of the overlap [34], whereas in [12] the repulsive\npart of the Lennard-Jones interaction was used. Dissipative forces act for the duration of each collision. The\nfirst of these is velocity-dependent damping along the line\n\n\f3\nbetween particle centers,\nfd = \u2212\u03b3n (r\u0302ij * vij )r\u0302ij ,\n\n(2)\n\nthat depends on the component of relative velocity vij =\nvi \u2212 vj parallel to rij . Here, \u03b3n is the normal damping\ncoefficient, assumed to be the same for all particles. The\ntotal normal force between particles is then fn = fv +fd .\nFrictional damping acts transversely at the point of\ncontact to oppose sliding while particles are within interaction range,\n\u0001 s\ns\n,\n(3)\n|, \u03bcci cj |fn | v\u0302ij\nfs = \u2212 min \u03b3sci cj |vij\n\nwhere the relative transverse velocity of the particle surfaces at this point, allowing for particle rotation, is\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndi \u03c9i + dj \u03c9j\ns\nvij\n= vij \u2212 (r\u0302ij * vij )r\u0302ij \u2212\n\u00d7 rij , (4)\ndi + dj\nc c\n\nand \u03c9i is the particle angular velocity. The value of \u03b3s i j\ndepends on the particle types ci and cj , and \u03bcci cj is the\nstatic friction coefficient that limits the transverse force\nto a value dependent on |fn |.\nIn a model of this type there is no true static friction,\na practical consequence of which would be stick-slip motion. A way of at least partially overcoming this limitation, though not strictly a correct means of incorporating\nthe effect, is to introduce a tangential restoring force that\nacts during the collision and depends on the cumulative\nrelative displacement at the point of contact [5, 31, 32].\nThis force has the form fg = \u2212kg uij , where\nZ\ns\nuij =\nvij\n(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n(5)\n(coll)\n\nis evaluated as a sum of vector displacements over the\ninterval the particles have been in contact; the magnitude of fg is also limited by \u03bcci cj |fn |. In addition, to\navoid occasional unrealistically large displacements (although this does not appear to affect the behavior), if\n|uij | > 0.1, an arbitrarily chosen limit, it is reset to zero\n(a form of ratcheting intuitively motivated by the asperities responsible for friction); an alternative treatment\nappears in [35]. This history-dependent force was not\npresent in [12]; the results below suggest that it plays\nan important role in achieving the correct form of radial\nsegregation. The total transverse force is ft = fs + fg .\nThe curved cylinder wall and the flat end caps are\ntreated as rough and smooth boundaries respectively.\nThe interaction of particles with the curved boundary\n(together with gravity) drives the system, so this force\nincludes the same components as the interparticle force.\nOn the other hand, to minimize spurious effects associated with the end caps, only fv and fd act there. Further\ndetails concerning the interactions (with the exception of\nfg ) appear in [12], together with a discussion of the friction coefficients and the particle-wall force computations.\nOther aspects of the simulation follow standard molecular dynamics procedures [36]; neighbor lists are used to\n\nefficiently organize the force computations, the translational and rotational equations of motion are integrated\nwith the leapfrog method, and parallel processing can\nimprove performance.\n\nB.\n\nParameters\n\nThose parameters that also appeared in [12] have\nbeen assigned similar values here. The first of these\nis the gravitational acceleration, g = 5, which then\nrelates the dimensionless MD units used in the simulation to the corresponding physical units. Thus, if\nLMD is the length\n\u221a unit (in mm), then the time unit\nis TMD \u2248 10\u22122 5LMD s. If the cylinder rotates with\nangular velocity \u03a9 (MD \u221a\nunits) the actual rotation rate\nis \u03a9/(2\u03c0TMD ) \u2248 7.1\u03a9/ LMD Hz; for 3 mm particles,\n\u03a9 = 0.1 is equivalent to 25 rpm, a typical experimental\nvalue.\nAxial segregation tends to develop slowly, leading to\nlong simulation runs. Computational cost can be reduced by using the largest possible integration time step;\nthe step size \u03b4t is limited by the highest particle speeds\nencountered and here the value used is \u03b4t = 5 \u00d7 10\u22123\n(MD units). Numerical stability considerations then set\na lower bound on the collision time to ensure it remains\nmuch larger than \u03b4t (typically 30\u201340\u00d7). Collisions between particles in the slowly varying bulk interior can be\nprotracted events, but the opposite is true for particles\nbouncing rapidly along the upper free surface, and this in\nturn constrains coefficients such as particle stiffness. For\nthe present work, most runs use kn = 1000 in Eq. (1).\nIncreasing this to, e.g., 105 would require a 10-fold reduction in \u03b4t and a much longer computation; however,\nsince there are \u2248 104 steps/revolution, some runs already\nexceed 107 steps, so this is not presently feasible in general.\nThe relatively small cylinder diameters and fill levels\nused here (details below) limit the compression forces\nthat particles can experience. At the base of a static\ncolumn of 10 small particles the overlap (which can be\nregarded as compression) will be 5% (for kn and g as\ngiven), an amount that is unlikely to alter the qualitative behavior; indeed, tangential forces will be enhanced\nfor softer particles that experience a greater number of\nlonger-lasting contacts. (Particles with the r\u221212 repulsion that is part of the force used in [12] have an overlap\nthree times larger; the ultimately greater resistance of\nthis force to compression asserts itself only at five times\nthe depth.) Systems with substantially thicker layers will\nrequire a stiffer volume interaction (and consequently a\nsmaller \u03b4t).\nThe values of the remaining parameters from [12] are\nas follows. In Eq. (2), \u03b3n = 5. The coefficients in Eq. (3)\nare \u03b3sbb = 10, and in general \u03b3sss = \u03b3sbs = 2, except for\na few cases where all \u03b3s = 10; the particle-wall values\nare identical. The relative values of the static friction\ncoefficients, e.g., \u03bcbb /\u03bcss , are set equal to the ratio of\n\n\f4\nthe corresponding \u03b3s values, with the larger of the pair\nequal to 0.5. Finally, the value of the new parameter\nintroduced with Eq. (5) is kg = 500, although, as with\nmost parameter settings, there is considerable latitude,\nand all that is required at this exploratory stage is for\nthe results to appear qualitatively reasonable.\nThe nominal particle diameter is the interaction cutoff\nin Eq. (1). For small particles, to maintain consistency\nwith [12], ds = 21/6 \u2248 1.122 (MD units), while for big\nparticles db = bds . The actual particle sizes are uniformly distributed over a narrow range [ds \u2212 0.2, ds ] for\nsmall particles, and likewise for big; the mean diameter\nof the small particles is then close to unity. Particles all\nhave the same density, so the big to small mass ratio (before allowing for the random size distribution) is b3 . The\nrelative population of big and small particles is chosen to\ngive equal volume fractions; for most runs b = 1.8, with\na big particle fraction of 0.15.\nThe cylinder diameter D and length L have value\nranges 30\u201340 and 120\u2013360 (MD units) respectively. (A\nconsequence of the use of soft potentials is that the effective D and L values are reduced by approximately one\nunit.) The aspect ratio L/D, a quantity having some\ninfluence on the number of axial segregation bands [25],\nlies between 4 and 12. The cylinders used here are relatively narrow, with D less than 30 times the mean particle diameter, a limitation that has been found experimentally to influence behavior [24]; even so, the number\nof particles in a simulation can exceed 70 000. Another\nconnection between experiment and simulation is the dimensionless Froude number Fr = \u03a92 D/2g, the ratio of\ncentrifugal to gravitational acceleration. Experimentally\nFr \u2248 10\u22123 \u201310\u22121 , and to ensure the simulations remain\nin the correct regime, the value should not be allowed to\nbecome too large; this sets an upper limit to \u03a9, and for\nthe simulations Fr < 0.2.\n\nC.\n\nMeasuring segregation\n\nQuantitative measures of the overall intensity of axial\nand radial segregation are used to augment direct observation. The time-dependent axial segregation, Sa (t), is\nevaluated from binned counts along the axis weighted by\nparticle mass,\nSa =\n\nh|b3 nb (q) \u2212 ns (q)|iq\n,\nb 3 nb + ns\n\n(6)\n\nwhere nb (q) and ns (q) are the number of big and small\nparticles in a slice (width \u2248 2.5) centered at q along the\naxis, h. . .iq denotes an average over all slices, and nb and\nns are the totals. Binned counts are less suitable for evaluating the radial segregation, Sr (t), because, if done in\nthe same way as the space-time plots discussed below,\nnot all particles would be able to contribute. An alternative measure, based on the mean-square radial distance of\neach type of particle from its center of mass, is therefore\n\nused,\nSr =\n\n(hrb2 i \u2212 hrb i2 ) \u2212 (hrs2 i \u2212 hrs i2 )\n,\nhr2 i \u2212 hri2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere hrb i and hrs i denote the mean distances of big and\nsmall particles from the axis, and hri the overall mean.\nTime is expressed in terms of the number of cylinder\nrevolutions, nR .\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDue to the very nature of the segregation effect, not\nall of its features are readily quantifiable. The functions\nSa (t) and Sr (t), Eqs. (6-7), provide a global summary of\npattern development, but lack detailed information concerning the number of axial bands, the sharpness of the\nboundaries between segregated regions and the regularity of the band pattern. The use of space-time plots,\ncoded using either color or grayscale level, provides a\nmuch more detailed picture of how both axial and radial segregation evolve with time. Such plots show the\nrelative populations, weighted by particle volumes, in appropriately oriented slices. For the axial plots, slices are\nnormal to the cylinder axis; while this does not provide\nthe same information as the surface populations seen in\nexperiment, it will be similar provided that radial inhomogeneity is weak. For the radial plots, slices are parallel\nto the upper free surface of the material; the nominal surface slope is determined by a linear fit to the inner 2/3 of\nthe surface away from the curved boundary, and only the\nparticle populations in a slab of similar width normal to\nthe surface are counted, to avoid bias due to the shape\nof the region.\nEven more detailed information can be extracted from\nsnapshots of the entire system, in which particular subsets of particles can be selected for viewing; images of\nthis kind can, for example, reveal interior organization\nanalogous to that observed experimentally with MRI. An\neven richer visual approach employs animated recordings\nshowing the full temporal development of the system. An\nanimation of this type consists of an extended series of\nsnapshots, recorded at regular intervals throughout the\nrun; all the information needed for the analysis that follows is in fact obtained from configurations reconstructed\nfrom such recordings.\nThe runs described here are cataloged in Table I; they\nare labeled alphabetically for reference and listed in the\norder they first appear in the discussion. Run lengths\nwere not specified in advance; a run was generally allowed to continue for as long as something interesting\nwas happening, or until it seemed that the system had\nstabilized (the possibility of premature termination can\nnever be ruled out), or until changes appeared to be occurring too slowly to warrant continuation.\nMost runs are begun from a uniformly mixed initial\nstate, and in a few cases, from a state that is presegregated into two axial bands. The particles are placed\n\n\f5\nTABLE I: Summary of runs discussed in the text; the top row\nincludes the default settings used unless indicated otherwise.\nIda\n\nSize, etc.b\nL\n\nD\n\n\u03c1\n\nN\n\nMc\nb\n\n\u03a9\n\nForcesd\nkn\n\nRe\n\nOutcome\nnR f Rdg\n\nkg \u03b3sss\n2\n\nAxh\n\nA\n\n240 40 .30 71 600 1.8 .2 M 1000 500\n\n1620\n\nP\n\n12\n\nB\n\n360 30\n\n57 600\n\n.1\n\n2630\n\nT\n\n17\u219211\n\nC\n\n160 40\n\n47 300\n\n.1\n\n1800\n\nP\n\n7\n\nD\n\n120 30 .50 35 900\n\n470\n\nP\n\n-\n\nE\n\n120 30\n\n18 800\n\n2940\n\nT\n\n6\n\nF\n\n120 30\n\n18 800\n\nR\n\n1310\n\nT\n\n5\n\nG\n\n120 30\n\n18 800\n\nR\n\n1310\n\nT\n\n7\u21924\n\nH\n\n120 30 .40 24 200\n\n730\n\nP\n\n-\n\nI\n\n120 30 .45 29 300\n\n590\n\nP\n\n-\n\nJ\n\n120 30\n\n18 800\n\n4290\n\nT\n\n6\u21923\n\nK\n\n360 30\n\n57 600\n\n2960\n\nT\n\n17\u219212\n\nL\n\n160 40\n\n47 300\n\n3320\n\nP\n\n7\n\nM\n\n120 30\n\n18 800\n\n0\n\n2040\n\nI\n\n3\n\nN\n\n120 30\n\n18 800\n\n0\n\n1030\n\nI\n\n5\n\nO\n\n120 30 .45 29 300\n\n0\n\n830\n\nP\n\n-\n\nP\n\n120 30\n\n19 200 1.5\n\n6350\n\n-\n\n7\u21925\n\nQ\n\n120 30\n\n19 200 1.3\n\nR\n\n120 30\n\n18 800\n\nS\n\n120 30\n\n18 800\n\nT\n\n180 30\n\n16 800\n\nS\n\nU\n\n180 30\n\n16 800\n\nS\n\nV\n\n160 40 .18 27 900\n\nS\n\n.1\n\nR\n\n2000\n10\n10\n\n2760\n\n-\n\n6\n\n2610\n\nT\n\n6\u21923\n\n6350\n\nP\n\n2i\n\n2840\n\n-\n\n2\n\n2440\n\nP\n\n-\n\n6110\n\n-\n\n2\u21924\n\na Runs\n\nare denoted in the text as #A, etc.\nlength L and diameter D, filling density \u03c1, number of\nparticles N (rounded to nearest 100), big particle size b, angular\nvelocity \u03a9.\nc M/S: Mixed or segregated initial state.\nd Values of force coefficients: k , k and \u03b3 ss ; all others are conn\ng\ns\nstant with values listed in the text.\ne R denotes repeat of preceding run with different initial state.\nf Run length, in cylinder revolutions.\ng Radial segregation: permanent, transient, inverted, or none.\nh Axial segregation: initial and final band count, or none.\ni Partial segregation only.\nb Cylinder\n\non a lattice and assigned small random velocities (details\nthat vanish after just a few collisions); particle species is\neither randomly assigned according to relative concentration, or, in the presegregated case, determined by axial\nposition. A change of random number seed allows repeated runs of systems that are otherwise identical.\nIn all cases the cylinder is capped at the ends. Use of\nan axially periodic cylinder leads to similar pattern development, establishing that caps are not required for segregation. However, as in [12], the entire band structure\nis then subject to axial drift. Since there is no evidence\nthat the caps affect the results (apart from relaxing the\nrequirement for an even number of bands in the periodic\ncase) they can be used without concern.\nIn view of the extensive simulations involved, it is interesting to consider the computational performance. For a\nsystem of 47 000 particles, and a partly parallelized computation running on a dual 3.6 GHz Intel Xeon workstation, the simulation proceeds at a rate of approximately\n23 000 time steps/hr, equivalent to 3.7 revolutions/hr at\n\u03a9 = 0.2; some of the runs therefore extend over several\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Axial and radial space-time plots for\nrun #A (nR = 1620, L = 240, L/D = 6); red and blue (or\nmedium and dark gray) denote higher volume fractions of big\nor small particles. Time, expressed as cylinder revolutions, is\nalong the horizontal axis, and the vertical axis measures axial\nor radial (the latter normal to the free surface) position.\n\nweeks. Contrast this with a typical experiment that can\nbe run at, e.g., 1000 revolutions/hr, irrespective of the\nnumber of particles.\n\nA.\n\nAxial and radial segregation\n\nThe first two runs discussed are among the more extensive carried out. While similar in respect to the initial radial segregation that peaks after some 10\u201320 revolutions and the appearance of multiple axial bands, in\none instance radial segregation persists while in the other\nit practically vanishes. The details of these two runs,\n#A and #B, will be described using axial and radial\nspace-time plots, together with pictures of the final states\nthat reveal the nature of the internal structure, and with\ngraphs of segregation as measured by Sa and Sr . Both\nruns suggest that a steady final state has been achieved,\nalthough, given the experimentally observed long-term\nslowdown in the bond merging rate, there is no way of\ncompletely excluding future changes of this type, no matter how long the run.\nFig. 1 shows the axial and radial space-time plots for\nrun #A. Radial segregation appears very early in the\nrun and a core of small particles persists throughout,\nalthough the outer layer rich in big particles disappears\nfrom the radial plot once axial banding begins; after the\n12 axial bands have formed the pattern appears stable,\nwith no hint of any future change.\nImages of the final state of run #A appear in Fig. 2.\nThe first is an oblique view of the full system showing\nthe 12 alternating bands. The others are views looking\ndown in a direction normal to the surface that show big\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Final state of run #A; the full system,\nand views showing just the big and small particles (colored\nsilver and gold).\n\nand small particles separately. These interior views reveal that while the bands of big particles are not entirely\nseparate, there are visible divisions between them, and\nthat the bands of small particles are joined by a central\ncore extending the length of the system.\nFig. 3 shows the space-time plots for run #B. Here,\nunlike #A, radial segregation is a transient effect lasting less than 200 revolutions; furthermore, the early axial pattern is not maintained, and the initial 17 bands\nare eventually reduced to 11 due to the vanishing of the\nsmall particle bands at the ends and the merging of two\npairs of big particle bands (eliminating two more small\nparticle bands). During the latter portion of the run, extending over more than half its total length, there is no\nsuggestion of further pattern change. Band coarsening is\na well-known experimental result, with the band count\nfalling roughly logarithmically with time [20], although\nthe dependence can be more complicated than this [22].\nThe images in Fig. 4 show the final state of #B. Band\nseparation is practically complete in this case, with essentially no misplaced big particles, and only the faintest\nremnant of a small particle core.\nThe development of axial and radial segregation, Sa\nand Sr , for these two runs is shown in Fig. 5. The graphs\nreflect what has already been noted in the space-time\nplots and images, namely, that a preference for small\nparticles in the core persists over the duration of #A, but\nnot #B; the presence of this core affects the magnitude\nof Sa , which is smaller in #A than in #B.\nThe images in the next two figures provide examples\nof radial segregation in cases where the effect is well developed. Fig. 6 shows #C after 60 revolutions; this run\neventually develops axial segregation. The complete system is shown, together with three narrow slices (of thickness 0.03L) at the midpoint and at a distance 0.1L from\neither end.\nFig. 7 shows #D after 260 revolutions (graphs of Sa\nand Sr for this run appear later). The view is along\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Axial and radial space-time plots for\n#B (nR = 2630, L = 360, L/D = 12).\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Final state of #B.\n\nthe axis, after slices of thickness 0.1L are removed from\neach end; on the left all particles are shown, while on\nthe right just the big particles appear. There is a visible\nopening extending along the entire length (0.8L) near the\ncenter of the small particle core; while the simulations\ndo not produce a totally pure core, radial segregation is\nstrong despite misplaced big particles; this rather short\nrun showed no hint of imminent axial segregation.\nTwo general observations concerning segregation\nemerge from these (and subsequent) simulation runs.\nWhen radial segregation occurs it takes the form of a\ncore of small particles surrounded by big particles (there\nis an exception that is discussed below); this is also the\ncase experimentally, although in the simulations the core\nboundaries are not as sharp and the effect appears to\ndevelop more slowly. There is no preferred particle type\nnear the end caps nor a tendency for bands to nucleate there; bands can form at different axial positions at\ndifferent times; sometimes bond formation is almost simultaneous and sometimes not.\n\n\f7\n0.8\n\n#A axial\n#A radial\n#B axial\n#B radial\n\nsegregation\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\nrevolutions\nFIG. 5: Time-dependent axial and radial segregation, Sa and\nSr , for runs #A and #B; time is expressed in cylinder revolutions.\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Axial and radial space-time plots for\nrun #E (nR = 2940) and, on the same scale, axial plots for#F\nand #G (nR = 1310) with different initial states (L = 120,\nL/D = 4).\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Views of #C after 60 revolutions; the\nfull system and three slices are shown.\n\nB.\n\nReproducibility\n\nThe issue of reproducibility is of particular importance\nsince conclusions must take into account the variability\nof the behavior, such as different intermediate or terminal band counts. Multiple runs would be required, as is\nnormal experimentally. In most cases this condition has\n\nnot been fulfilled, but an example of three runs involving\nsystems that are identical, apart from the initial random\nstate, is considered here (and one further example appears later).\nFig. 8 shows the axial and radial space-time plots for\nrun #E, together with the axial plots for the shorter runs\n#F and #G. The behavior differs (although Sa and Sr\nare only weakly affected); each exhibits early radial segregation, but they differ in regard to axial band development. This is just what happens experimentally under\nappropriate conditions [20]; some aspects of the segregation (Sa and Sr ) are reasonably robust, while others\n(the band details) may vary significantly between runs.\nA preferred wavelength governing the axial band pattern\ncould exist, but since development history can influence\noutcome, it is probably only meaningful to refer to a\nmean number of bands (and a mean wavelength).\n\nC.\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Views of #D after 260 revolutions (see\ntext for explanation).\n\nParameter dependence\n\nWhen comparing simulation to experiment, the parameters defining the system fall into two categories.

The others are related to the\nproperties of the particles themselves; while there are\nnumerous types of granular material available for experimental study, efforts have tended to focus on a rather\nlimited subset, so that a systematic coverage of behavior\nin terms of material properties is presently unavailable.\nChanging the fill level can alter the nature of the segregation, as seen experimentally with slurries [21]. Fig. 9\nshows Sa and Sr for four runs differing only in their fill\nlevel, #E, #H, #I and #D (because of the slight reduction in effective cylinder size mentioned earlier, \u03c1 = 0.45\ncorresponds to a cylinder that is approximately half full,\nwhile for \u03c1 = 0.3 the layer depth is close to 83 D). In #E,\ntransient radial segregation is followed by axial, while\nin the other three cases only radial segregation occurs.\nThese and other runs suggest that a sufficiently high\nfill level favors permanent radial segregation and at the\nsame time suppresses axial segregation. Validation of the\nmodel, and determining how closely it reproduces experiment, requires that behavioral trends under a change\nof parameters be reproduced correctly; while experiment\nsuggests band suppression at low fill levels [21], this applies to slurries, and the degree of similarity between dry\nand wet mixtures has yet to be studied systematically.\nThe cylinder angular velocity \u03a9 is the parameter most\nreadily changed in an experiment. The \u03a9 dependence\n(using the values \u03a9 = 0.2 and 0.1) for three pairs of runs\nthat are otherwise the same has been examined; the run\npairs are #E and #J that eventually produce 6 and 3\nbands, #K and #B that produce 12 and 11 bands and,\nlastly, #L and #C that both produce 7 bands (a tentative\nresult in the case of #C). A feature common to each of\nthese pairs is that Sa is slightly larger at reduced \u03a9.\n\nThe influence of other parameters will be mentioned\nonly briefly. Runs #M and #N show the effect of removing the tangential restoring force, kg = 0 in Eq. (5), in\na sense making the particles less \"grain-like\". The runs\nare otherwise similar to #E and, apart from the function used for fv in Eq. (1), now resemble [12]; so do the\nresults, in which axial segregation is now accompanied\nby inverse radial segregation. This outcome confirms the\nimportance of fg for obtaining the correct radial behavior. Early in these runs weak normal radial segregation\noccurs, but it becomes inverted when the axial bands\nappear. Different behavior is encountered at a higher fill\nlevel; run #O, which is related to run #I in a similar way,\nshows normal radial but no axial segregation. Outcomes\nsuch as these hint at the complex interplay of parameters and call for an extensive coverage, with multiple\nruns, prior to drawing conclusions.\nAnother key parameter is b, the relative size of the big\nparticles. In run #P, b is reduced to 1.5, and 5 axial\nbands appear, but no measurable radial segregation; b is\nfurther reduced to 1.3 (the preferred value in [12]) in run\n#Q, resulting in 6 bands. In the opposite direction, it\nis questionable how large b can become without having\nto increase cylinder diameter to avoid serious size effects\n(and, to maintain aspect ratio, also its length), but for\nb = 2.1 (not shown), depending on fill level, both radial and axial segregation can be obtained; experiment\ntypically involves b \u2248 3 or greater.\nMaking the particles slightly less compressible by doubling kn , in run #R, leads to initial radial segregation,\nand eventually three axial bands. A more substantial\nincrease in kn would, as noted earlier, require a smaller\n\u03b4t. Further runs (not shown) similar to #A, but with\nkn and all the other interaction coefficients increased by\nfactors of 10 or 100, and with suitably reduced \u03b4t, produce the same segregation effects, confirming that this\naspect of the model does not significantly influence the\nbehavior. A similar conclusion applies to granular chute\nflow [35]. For a final example of parameter dependence\n(requiring further study), run #S is similar to #E except\nthat \u03b3sss = \u03b3sbb = 10; radial segregation occurs, suggesting that this effect can be driven by particle size difference alone, and eventually two weakly developed axial\nbands appear (the outcome of this long run is less clear\nthan usual since a final state had yet to develop).\n\nD.\n\nParticle motion\n\nThe configurational snapshots recorded during the\nruns enable post-run analysis of the motion of individual\nor selected groups of particles over extended intervals.\nAn eventual goal for this kind of analysis is developing a\ncapability for relating local organization and dynamics at\nthe level of individual particles to the behavior at a scale\nwhere the collective nature of segregation is exhibited.\nTwo examples will be considered here.\nThe first is the merging of two bands of big particles,\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 10: (Color online) Band merging in run #B where small\nparticles from the middle band disperse allowing the big particle bands to merge; the views show the full system and the\nparticles from the bands involved, both before and after the\nevent.\n\naccompanied by the dispersal of the small particles from\nthe disappearing middle band. A merge event of this\ntype occurs in run #B (see Fig. 3) between revolutions\n700 and 1200. The upper portion of Fig. 10 shows three\nviews prior to the event, namely the full system, and\nthe selected bands of big and small particles (the latter\nalso revealing small particles that intrude into the big\nparticle band, a detail hidden from the outside). The\nlower portion shows three views at the completion of the\nevent, namely the full system, and all the previously selected particles in their new positions, principally within\nthe bands directly involved. Even though there is essentially no residual small particle core at this stage of the\nrun, small particles are able to migrate across the big\nparticle bands more readily than the converse; selective\nmigration of this kind will be even more apparent in the\nnext example. An interesting feature revealed by these\nimages is that while the small particles are dispersed in\nboth directions, more seem to have traveled to the right\nwhere the original band of big particles was somewhat\nnarrower; while such behavior might not be unexpected\nit is gratifying to see it actually occurring.\nThe second example also involves run #B, but now for\nmonitoring the steady state over a relatively long interval between revolutions 1230 and 2600. The first view in\nFig. 11 is of the entire system at the beginning; the next\ntwo views show the adjacent, slightly overlapped bands\nof big and small particles selected for tracking. The last\ntwo views show all the selected particles in their final positions (since the band structure is stationary, views of\nthe entire system during the interval are practically indistinguishable); although quite a few small particles (but\nconstituting only a tiny fraction of the band population)\nhave migrated out of the band in both directions, almost\nno big particles have done likewise, demonstrating that\nthey are effectively confined for lack of an escape path.\nDeparting particles are replaced by others, but these are\nnot shown. This form of analysis can also be carried\nout experimentally by adding tracer particles to existing\n\nFIG. 11: (Color online) Particle migration and confinement\nover an interval of almost 1400 revolutions during run #B;\nthe views show the full system at the start of the interval\ntogether with the selected bands of big and small particles,\nand the same sets of big and small particles at the end.\n\nFIG. 12: (Color online) Final state of #T; top, bottom, big\nand small particle views.\n\nbands [22], revealing that confinement is indeed a strong\neffect.\n\nE.\n\nPresegregated systems\n\nAn alternative perspective is provided by systems that\nbegin in an axially segregated state, a problem also studied experimentally with MRI [22, 37]. Various scenarios exist, of which preserving the original state and axial mixing represent two extremes, while rearrangement\ninto some other band pattern is also a possibility. Examples of all three types will be considered. Very little\nchange occurs over the duration of run #T. Fig. 12 shows\nits final state, and from the top and bottom views it is\napparent that the interface has adopted a curved form.\nThe views showing big and small particles separately reveal that comparatively small numbers of each type have\npenetrated into the opposite region; interestingly, in this\nexample big particles also appear to be participating in\nthe migration.\nMixing is most easily achieved by setting all the friction\nparameters equal (as in #S, where only a weak axial\neffect was seen). Fig. 13 shows the outcome of this in\nrun #U; the initial axial segregation vanishes promptly\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 15: Averaged surface profiles for big and small particles\n(big and small points) for run #L (D = 40).\n\nFIG. 13: (Color online) Axial and radial space-time plots for\n#U (nR = 2440, L = 180, L/D = 6).\n\nFIG. 14: (Color online) Axial space-time plot for #V (nR =\n6110, L = 160, L/D = 4).\n\nand a certain amount of radial segregation appears.\nThe final scenario, the appearance of an altered axial\nband pattern, occurs in run #V (similar to #L but with\nfewer particles), shown in Fig. 14. The most prominent\nfeature here is the splitting of the small particle band\nby a new band of big particles. The process involves\nparticle migration in both directions; from the recorded\nconfigurations (not shown) it appears that small particles\nfollow an interior path while big particles tend to prefer\na path close to the curved cylinder wall; the dynamics of\nthis process is yet another aspect of the overall problem\nneeding further study.\n\nF.\n\nSurface profiles\n\nThe motion of particles along the upper free surface\nplays a role in the segregation process, although the importance of this contribution and the mechanism involved\nis open to question. The detailed form of the surface is\n\ntherefore of interest, although it is not readily characterized and, for a specific particle mixture, it will depend on\nfill level, rotation rate and cylinder diameter. The profile\nof the free surface typically varies slightly with position\nalong the axis once axial segregation has occurred. For\nthese reasons, just one instance is included here. Experimental examples, ranging from strongly S-shaped to\nalmost linear, appear in [38].\nFig. 15 shows the axially averaged surface profile near\nthe end of run #L, where there are seven bands; big\nand small particles are treated individually, and the results represent an average over ten configurations spaced\nsix revolutions apart. The profiles are reasonably close\nto linear (curved profiles similar to [12] can be obtained\nat lower fill levels); the big particles appear slightly below the small because it is the particle centers that are\nmonitored. There are deviations adjacent to the curved\ncylinder wall, but here the data binning produces some\ndistortion. Whether the slight deviations from linearity\nare important for the segregation process remains to be\nseen. Except at the start, there is no obvious change in\nthis profile over the entire run.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSimulations based on a simple particle-based model of\ngranular matter have been used to demonstrate the occurrence of both radial and axial segregation in a rotating\ncylinder containing a two-component granular mixture.\nThe earlier inability to reproduce radial segregation correctly has been resolved; for the type of model considered, this is due to the omission of a component of the\nfrictional force that helps resist sliding during collisions.\nThe different forms of segregation observed are indicative of a large, complex parameter space, as is the case\nexperimentally.\nIn order to learn more about the phase diagram and determine which parameters dominate in different regimes,\na systematic study, including multiple realizations due\nto reproducibility issues, is required. The results suggest\nmany questions of the \"what if\" type; of necessity, the\nanswers will also have to await further work. The model\n\n\f11\nitself is open to critical examination, in particular, how\nthe components of the interparticle force influence the behavior (one example has already been given), as well as\nthe relevant ranges of the force parameters. More generally, in view of the way static friction is represented,\nhow reliable is the model altogether (a question equally\napplicable to similar models appearing elsewhere)?\nIn theoretical fluid dynamics, stability analysis [39] is\nused to determine when symmetry breaking is advantageous. No analogous theory exists for the granular segregation phenomena described here, and the question of\nwhat distinguishes the different segregation modes from\none another, and from the uniformly mixed state, remains open; is it, for example, the ability to optimize\nenergy dissipation, thereby ensuring the most efficient\n\nflow? The segregation band coarsening slows with increasing band width, and the states eventually reached\nhave varying numbers of bands and degrees of pattern\nregularity; here the question is whether such patterns\nare stable, or are they slow transients en route to even\nfurther coarsening? Another issue is the relation between\nthe radial and axial segregation processes; are they independent phenomena that just happen to coexist (perhaps\nin competition) in most, but not all situations, or does\nthe former actually drive the latter? Finally, no attempt\nhas been made to probe the underlying mechanisms beyond the exercises in particle tracking; if simulation can\nbe shown to reproduce experiment reliably, then, in view\nof the level of detail provided, it may prove an important\ntool for exploring the complexities of segregation.\n\n[1] G.
