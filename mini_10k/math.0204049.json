Introduction\nIf f is a continuous, real function on some interval I in R, we can use spectral\ntheory to define an operator function\nZ\nI\nf : B(H)sa \u2212\n\u2192 B(H)sa where f (x) = f (\u03bb) dEx (\u03bb).\n(1)\nHere B(H)Isa denotes the convex set of self-adjoint operators on the Hilbert space\nH with spectra in I, and Ex denotes the spectral measure of x. Admittedly it is\nsomewhat dangerous to use the same symbol for the two rather different functions,\nbut the usage is sanctified by time. Whenever necessary we shall try to distinguish\nbetween the two by referring either to the function f or to the operator function f .\nAs pointed out by C. Davis in [4] a general operator function F : B(H)Isa \u2212\n\u2192 B(H)\narises from a spectral function, i.e. F (x) = f (x), if and only if for every unitary u\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nF (u xu) = u F (x)u and F\n\n\u0012\n\ny\n0\n\n0\nz\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nF (y)\n0\n0\nF (z)\n\n\u0013\n\n(2)\n\nfor every operator x = y + z that decomposes in block form by multiplication by\na projection p in its commutant. (N.b. we do not demand that p and 1 \u2212 p are\nequivalent.) There is a slight ambiguity in this statement \u2013 easily compensated for\nby its versatility \u2013 since by F(y) we really mean F evaluated at y, but now regarded\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Put differently, we demand that pF (y + z) =\nF (y + z)p and that it is independent of z. Thus, pF (y + z) = pF (y + s(1 \u2212 p)) for\nsome, hence any scalar s in I. (Davis tacitly assumes that 0 \u2208 I and takes s = 0.)\nA continuous function f : I \u2212\n\u2192 R is said to be operator convex if\nf (\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y) \u2264 \u03bbf (x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f (y)\n\n(3)\n\nfor each \u03bb in [0, 1] and every pair of self-adjoint operators x, y on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space H with spectra in I. The function is said to be matrix convex\nof order n if the same conditions are satisfied for operators on a Hilbert space of\nfinite dimension n. It is well known, cf. [2, Lemma 2.2] that a function is operator\nconvex if and only if it is matrix convex of arbitrary orders.\nJust because the function f is convex there is no guarantee that the operator\nfunction f is convex. In fact, as shown by Bendat and Sherman in [2], f is operator\nconvex on the interval ] \u2212 1, 1[ if and only if it has a (unique) representation\nZ 1\n1\nt2 (1 \u2212 \u03b1t)\u22121 d\u03bc(\u03b1),\n(4)\nf (t) = \u03b20 + \u03b21 t + 2 \u03b22\n\u22121\n\nfor \u03b22 \u2265 0 and some probability measure \u03bc on [\u22121, 1]. In particular, f must be\nanalytic with f (0) = \u03b20 , f \u2032 (0) = \u03b21 and f \u2032\u2032 (0) = \u03b22 . A concise account of this\nresult and its relations to L\u00f6wner's theory of operator monotonicity can be found\nin [9].\nAn unexpected phenomenon turns up in relation\nwith convexity in B(H)sa . If\nPn\n\u2217\n(a1 , . . . , aP\n)\nis\nan\nn\u2212tuple\nof\noperators\nwith\na\nn\nk=1 k ak = 1, we may think of the\nn\n\u2217\nelement k=1 ak xk ak as a non-commutative convex combination of the n\u2212tuple\n(x1 , . . . , xn ) in B(H)sa . The remarkable fact is that when f is an operator convex\nfunction, then the operator function f respects this new structure in the sense that\nwe have the Jensen operator inequality:\n!\nn\nn\nX\nX\nf\na\u2217k xk ak \u2264\na\u2217k f (xk )ak .\n(5)\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nThis result was found in embryonic form by the first author in [6], and used by the\ntwo of us to give a review of L\u00f6wner's and Bendat-Sherman's theory of operator\nmonotone and operator convex functions in [9]. With hindsight we must admit\nthat we unfortunately proved and used the contractive form f (a\u2217 xa) \u2264 a\u2217 f (x)a for\na\u2217 a \u2264 1, this being the seemingly most attractive version at the time. However,\nthis necessitated the further conditions that 0 \u2208 I and f (0) \u2264 0, conditions that\nhave haunted the theory since then. The Jensen inequality for a normal trace on a\nvon Neumann algebra, now for an arbitrary convex function f , was found by Brown\nand Kosaki in [3], still in the contractive version.\nIt is the aim of the present paper to rectify our omissions and prove the full Jensen\ninequality, both with and without a trace. This is accomplished by a refinement of\nprevious techniques and by applying some new ideas that also make the presentation\nmore streamlined and easier to follow.\n\n\fJENSEN'S OPERATOR INEQUALITY\n\n3\n\n2. Main Results\nTheorem 2.1 (Jensen's Operator Inequality).\nFor a continuous function f defined on an interval I the following conditions are\nequivalent:\n(i) f is operator convex.\n(ii) For each natural number n we have the inequality\n!\nn\nn\nX\nX\n\u2217\nf\na i xi a i \u2264\na\u2217i f (xi )ai\n(5)\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nfor every n\u2212tuple (x1 , . . . , xn ) of bounded, self-adjoint operators on an arbitrary\nHilbert space H with\ncontained in I and every n\u2212tuple (a1 , . . . , an ) of operPn spectra\n\u2217\nators on H with k=1 ak ak = 1.\n(iii) f (v \u2217 xv) \u2264 v \u2217 f (x)v for each isometry v on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space\nH and every self-adjoint operator x with spectrum in I.\n(vi) pf (pxp + s(1 \u2212 p))p \u2264 pf (x)p for each projection p on an infinite-dimensional\nHilbert space H, every self-adjoint operator x with spectrum in I and every s in I.\nRemark 2.2. If the Jensen operator inequality (5) is satisfied for some n \u2265 2 and\nfor operators on a Hilbert space H (of any dimension), then clearly f is operator\nconvex on B(H). The point of condition (iii) is that if H infinite-dimensional it\nsuffices to take n = 1. On the other hand it is clear that if (5) is satisfied for some\nn, then (setting ai = 0 for i > 1) it is also satisfied for n = 1.\nCorollary 2.3 (Contractive Version).\nLet f be a continuous function defined on an interval I and suppose that 0 \u2208 I.\nThen f is operator convex and f (0) \u2264 0 if and only if for some, hence every natural\nnumber n, the inequality (5) is valid for every n\u2212tuple (x1 , . . . , xn ) of bounded,\nself-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space H with\ncontained in I, and every\nPn spectra\n\u2217\nn\u2212tuple (a1 , . . . , an ) of operators on H with k=1 ak ak \u2264 1.\n\nSetting n = 1 we see that f is operator convex on an interval I containing 0 with\nf (0) \u2264 0 if and only if\nf (a\u2217 xa) \u2264 a\u2217 f (x)a\n(6)\nfor every self-adjoint x with spectrum in I and every contraction a. This is the\noriginal Jensen operator inequality from [9].\nTheorem 2.4 (Jensen's Trace Inequality).\nLet f be a continuous function defined on an interval I and let m and n be natural\nnumbers. If f is convex we then have the inequality\n!\n!!\nn\nn\nX\nX\n(7)\n\u2264 Tr\na\u2217i f (xi )ai\nTr f\na\u2217i xi ai\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nfor every n\u2212tuple (x1 , . . . , xn ) of self-adjoint m\u00d7m matrices with\nPn spectra contained\nin I and every n\u2212tuple (a1 , . . . , an ) of m \u00d7 m matrices with k=1 a\u2217k ak = 1.\nConversely, if the inequality (7) is satisfied for some n and m, where n > 1, then\nf is convex.\n\n\f4\n\nFRANK HANSEN & GERT K. PEDERSEN\n\nCorollary 2.5 (Contractive Version).\nLet f be a convex, continuous function defined on an interval I, and suppose that\n0 \u2208 I and f (0) \u2264 0. Then for all natural numbers m and n we have the inequality (7)\nfor every n\u2212tuple (x1 , . . . , xn ) of self-adjoint m\u00d7m matrices with\ncontained\nPn spectra\n\u2217\nin I and every n\u2212tuple (a1 , . . . , an ) of m \u00d7 m matrices with k=1 ak ak \u2264 1.\nRemark 2.6. Let n = 1 in (7). If f is convex, 0 \u2208 I and f (0) \u2264 0 we have\nTr (f (a\u2217 xa)) \u2264 Tr (a\u2217 f (x)a)\n\n(8)\n\nfor every self-adjoint m\u00d7m matrix x with spectrum in I and every m\u00d7m contractive\nmatrix a. This is Jensen's trace inequality (for matrices) of Brown and Kosaki [3].\nThis inequality alone is not sufficient to ensure convexity of f , even if m > 1\n(unless f (0) = 0 is specified in advance). However, for n > 1 the inequality gives\nconvexity of f as we see from Theorem 2.4. In each case we must assume that 0 \u2208 I,\notherwise the inequality does not make sense. This fact, together with the irrelevant\ninformation about f (0), makes the contractive versions of Jensen's inequality less\ndesirable. When we eventually pass to the theory of several variables, cf. [10], the\ncontractive versions mean that 0 belongs to the cube where f is defined, so that\npart of the coordinate axes must belong to the domain of definition for f , and on\nthese we must assume that f \u2264 0. This assumption is so severe a restraint that it\nbecomes a real problem for the theory.\nTheorem 2.7 (Jensen's Trace Inequality for C \u2217 \u2212Algebras).\nLet f be a convex, continuous function defined on an interval I and let A be a\nC \u2217 \u2212algebra with a finite trace \u03c4 . Then the inequality\n!\n!!\nn\nn\nX\nX\na\u2217i f (xi )ai\n(9)\na\u2217i xi ai\n\u2264\u03c4\n\u03c4 f\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nis valid for every n\u2212tuple (x1 , . . . , xn ) of self-adjoint elements\nin A with spectra\nPn\ncontained in I and every n\u2212tuple (a1 , . . . , an ) in A with k=1 a\u2217k ak = 1.\nIf the trace \u03c4 is unbounded, but lower semi-continuous and densely defined, the\ninequality (9) is still valid if f \u2265 0, although now some of the numbers may be\ninfinite.\n\n3. Unital and Unitary Tuples\nNotations. An n\u2212tuple a = (a1 , . . . , an ) of operators\nPn in\u2217 B(H) is called a contractive\ncolumn (respectively a unital column) if\nk=1 ak ak \u2264 1 (respectively\nPn\n\u2217\na\na\n=\n1).\nContractive\nrows\nand\nunital\nrows\nare defined analogously by\nk=1 k k\nPn\nPn\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthe conditions k=1 ak ak \u2264 1 and k=1 ak ak = 1. We say that a = (a1 , . . . , an )\nis a unitary column if there is a unitary n \u00d7 n operator matrix U = (uij ), one of\nwhose columns is (a1 , . . . , an ). Thus, uij = ai for some j and all i.

If we\ninsist that a unital column of elements in a unital C \u2217 \u2212algebra A should be called\na unitary column only if we can choose the unitary in Mn (A), then already for A\ncommutative, viz.

It follows from [1, Corollary 2.2] that this holds if just one of\nthe operators ai has (generalized) index zero, since in this case ai = u|ai | for some\nunitary u on H. We are then reduced to the situation where one of the operators,\nsay an , is positive, so that with b = (a1 , . . . , an\u22121 ) we can extend V to the unitary\noperator\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(1 \u2212 b(b)\u2217 )1/2 b\nU=\n.\n(10)\n\u2212(b)\u2217\nan\nIt follows that every contractive n\u2212column\nPn can be enlarged to a unitary (n + 1)\u2013\ncolumn simply by setting an+1 = (1 \u2212 k=1 a\u2217k ak )1/2 . In particular, every unital\nn\u2212column can be enlarged to a unitary (n + 1)\u2212column with an+1 = 0.

If we take g(\u03bb) = \u03bb,\nthen\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\nZ\n\u2217\n\u03bb d\u03bcs (\u03bb) = \u03a6\nat xt at d\u03bc(t) (s) = \u03a6(y)(s) = y(s).\n(37)\nI\n\nT\n\nSince y \u2208 C we get by (37) and (36) \u2013 using also the convexity of f in form of the\nstandard Jensen inequality \u2013 that\n\u0012Z\n\n\u0013\n\nf (y)(s) = f (y(s)) = f\n\u03bb d\u03bcs (\u03bb)\nI\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\nZ\n\u2217\n\u2264\nf (\u03bb) d\u03bcs (\u03bb) = \u03a6\na f (xt )at d\u03bc(t) (s).\n\n(38)\n\n\fJENSEN'S OPERATOR INEQUALITY\n\n11\n\nIntegrating over s, using (35), now gives the desired result:\n\u03c6(f (y)) =\n\nZ\n\nf (y)(s) d\u03bc\u03c6(s)\n\u0013\n\u0012Z\nZ\n\u2217\nat f (xt )at d\u03bc(t) (s) d\u03bc\u03c6 (s)\n\u2264\n\u03a6\nT\nS\nZ Z\n=\n\u03a6 (a\u2217t f (xt )at ) (s) d\u03bc\u03c6 (s) d\u03bc(t)\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\nZT S\n\u2217\n\u2217\nat f (xt )at d\u03bc(t) .\n=\n\u03c6 (at f (xt )at ) d\u03bc(t) = \u03c6\nS\n\nT\n\n(39)\n\nT\n\nHaving proved the finite case, let us now assume that \u03c6 is unbounded, but lower\nsemi-continuous on A+ and finite on the minimal dense ideal K(A) of A. This \u2013\nby definition \u2013 means that \u03c6(x) < \u221e if x \u2208 A+ and x = xe for some e in A+ ,\nbecause K(A) is the hereditary \u2217 \u2212subalgebra of A generated by such elements, cf.\n[17, 5.6.1]. Restricting \u03c6 to C we therefore obtain a unique Radon measure \u03bc\u03c6 on\nS such that\nZ\nz(t) d\u03bc\u03c6 (t) = \u03c6(z)\ny \u2208 C.\n(40)\nS\n\nInspection of the proof above now shows that the Jensen trace inequality still holds\nif only f \u2265 0, even though \u221e may now occur in the inequality.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 2.7. Evidently this (like Theorem 2.4) is a special case of Theorem\n4.1, where the continuous field is replaced by a finite sum and the functional \u03c6 is a\ntrace, so that A\u03c6 = A.\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nFRANK HANSEN & GERT K.
