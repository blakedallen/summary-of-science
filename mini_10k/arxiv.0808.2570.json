[1, 2] and\nthen described in a variety of systems, such as chemical reactions [3], semiconductors [4], granular media [5],\nbinary-fluid convection [6, 7], vegetation patterns [8], and\nalso in nonlinear optical cavities where they are usually\nreferred as Cavity Solitons (CS) [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] (see\nRef. [14, 15, 16] for recent surveys). Their potential in\noptical storage and processing of information has been\nstressed [17]. In this work we shall consider solitons that\nappear in a subcritical bifurcation [11, 18, 19].\nIn general, dissipative solitons may develop a number\nof instabilities like start moving, breathing, or oscillating. In the latter case, they would oscillate in time while\nremaining stationary in space, like the oscillons (oscillating localized structures) found in a vibrated layer of\nsand [5]. The occurrence of these oscillons in autonomous\nsystems has been reported both in optical [20, 21] and\nchemical systems [22]. It has been shown that they can\nbecome unstable leading to excitable solitons in systems\nfor which the local dynamics is not excitable [23, 24]. In\nthis case excitability appears as an emergent property\narising from the spatial dependence, which allows for the\nformation of these structures. In particular, for solitons\narising in uniformly pumped Kerr cavities, excitability is\nmediated by a saddle-loop (homoclinic) (SL) bifurcation,\nand it is characterized by a large excitability threshold\nand by occurring at any point of space that is properly\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: jacobo@ifisc.uib-csic.es\naddress: damia@ifisc.uib-csic.es\n\u2021 Electronic address: Manuel.Matias@ifisc.uib-csic.es\n\u00a7 Electronic address: pere@ifisc.uib-csic.es\n\u00b6 URL: http://ifisc.uib-csic.es\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nexcited [23, 24].\nSince CS excitability emerges from the spatial dependence it is interesting to study the effect of breaking the\ntranslational symmetry on the excitable dynamics. In optical systems this can be easily done by applying a (small\namplitude) localized beam on top of the homogeneous\npump. Addressing beams are typically used already to\ncreate CS by applying a transient perturbation. Here we\nanalyze the dynamics of CS in a Kerr cavity where we\napply a permanent addressing beam. On one hand, this\npump allows to control the place where a CS appears.\nOn the other hand, the system remains excitable and a\nnew route, mediated by a Saddle-Node on an Invariant\nCircle (SNIC) bifurcation, appears. It is characterized\nby the fact that the excitable threshold is fully tunable,\nas it scales with the proximity to the bifurcation.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The model and\noverall dynamical behavior exhibited by the system in parameter space are described in Sect. II and III. Sect. IV\naddresses the instability exhibited by CS through a SNIC\nbifurcation. Sect. V discusses the excitable routes found\nin this system. Sect. VI and VII discuss the codimension2 points that organize the overall scenario. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Sect. VIII.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nA prototype model describing an optical cavity filled\nwith a nonlinear Kerr medium is the one introduced by\nLugiato and Lefever [25] with the goal of studying pattern\nformation in this optical system. Later studies showed\nthat this equation also exhibits CS in some parameter\nregimes [20, 26]. The model describes the dynamics of\nthe slowly varying amplitude of the electromagnetic field\nE(~x, t) in the paraxial and mean field approximations\n(~x = (x, y) is the plane transverse to the propagation\ndirection z on which the slow dynamics takes place). The\ndynamics of the field is given by:\n\u2202E\n= \u2212(1 + i\u03b8)E + i\u22072 E + EI (~x) + i|E 2 |E\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere \u22072 = \u2202 2 /\u2202x2 + \u2202 2 /\u2202y 2 .\nThe first term in the right hand side describes cavity\nlosses, EI (~x) is the input field (pump), \u03b8 is the cavity\ndetuning with respect to EI , and the sign of the cubic\nterm represents the self-focusing case. Notice that in the\nabsence of losses and of an input field, the field can be\nrescaled to E \u2192 Eei\u03b8t to remove the detuning term and\nEq. (1) becomes the Nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger Equation\n(NLSE). It is well documented that in this case, and in\ntwo spatial dimensions, the NLSE exhibits the so called\ncollapse regime [27], in which energy accumulates at a\npoint of space. Collapse is prevented in Eq. (1) by the\ncavity losses leading to stable CS.\nFor spatially homogeneous pump EI (~x) = E0 , Eq. (1)\nhas a homogeneous steady state solution given implicitly by E0 = Es [1 + i(\u03b8 \u2212 Is )], where Is = |Es |2 [25].\nThis solution is stable for low pump strength, that is for\nIs < 1. At Is = 1, the so-called modulation instability\n(MI) point, the homogeneous solution becomes unstable\nand extended patterns appear subcritically. The patterns\narising at MI are typically oscillatory and increasing the\npump they undergo further instabilities which eventually lead to optical turbulence [28, 29]. Static hexagonal\npatterns can be found subcritically, that is, decreasing\nthe pump value below the MI point. CS appear in the\nregion of bistability between the homogeneous solution\nand the pattern. In fact there are two CS that appear\nthrough a saddle-node (fold) bifurcation, the one with\nlarger amplitude (upper-branch CS) is stable at least for\nsome parameter range, while the one with smaller amplitude (middle-branch CS) is always unstable. Early\nstudies already identified that the upper branch CS may\nundergo a Hopf bifurcation leading to a oscillatory behavior [20]. The oscillatory instabilities, as well as azimuthal\ninstabilities, were fully characterized later [21]. As one\nmoves in parameter space away from the Hopf bifurcation, the CS oscillation amplitude grows, and finally the\nlimit cycle touches the middle-branch CS in a saddle-loop\nbifurcation which leads to a regime of excitable dissipative structures [23, 24].\nHere, we consider a pump beam of the form\nEI (r) = E0 + H exp(\u2212r2 /r02 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E0 is a homogeneous field, assumed real, H the\nheight of the localized Gaussian perturbation, r2 = x2 +\ny 2 , while r0 = 1. For convenience, we write the height of\nthe Gaussian beam as,\np\nH = (Is + Ish ) [1 + (\u03b8 \u2212 Is \u2212 Ish )2 ] \u2212 E0 ,\n(3)\nwhere Is is the background intracavity intensity (due to\nE0 ) and Is + Ish corresponds to the intracavity field intensity of a cavity driven by an homogeneous field with a\namplitude equal to one at the top of the Gaussian beam,\nEI = E0 + H. This directly relates the height of the\nGaussian beam H with the equivalent intracavity intensity for a homogeneous pump. Notice that for Ish = 0\nthe pump beam becomes homogeneous, H(Ish = 0) = 0,\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Bifurcation diagram, max(I) vs Is ,\nfor a CS for Ish = 0.3, \u03b8 = 1.25. Solid lines represent stable\nsolutions and dashed lines unstable ones. The insets show the\ntransverse profile of the solutions.\n\nWith the inclusion of the localized pump beam the system has now three independent control parameters which\nfor convenience take as the background intensity, Is , the\ndetuning \u03b8 and Ish .\nThe numerical methods used to study this system are\ndetailed in the Appendix of Ref. [24]. Eq. (1), with the\napplied pump (2), has been solved numerically using a\npseudospectral method, where the linear terms are integrated exactly in Fourier space, while the nonlinear ones\nare integrated using a second order in time approximation. Periodic boundary conditions in a square lattice of\nsize 512 \u00d7 512 points were used. The stability of steady\nCS has been studied using the semi-analytical method\ndiscussed in the above mentioned Appendix, using the\nradial version of Eq. (1), that simplifies the study taking\ninto account the axisymmetric nature of the solutions.\nIII.\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE BEHAVIOR OF THE\nSYSTEM\n\nOne of the main consequences of the application of a\nlocalized pump is the breaking of the translational symmetry of Eq. (1). Solutions are now pinned in the region\nin which the Gaussian pump is applied. This also affects\nthe transverse profile of the solutions, in particular the\nfundamental solution is no longer spatially homogeneous\nbut it exhibits a bump as illustrated by the lower inset\nin Fig. 1.\nTo understand better the effects of the application of\na localized pump, a diagram like the one shown in Fig. 2\nof Ref. [24], that represents the maximum intensity of\nthe transverse field as a function of Is is shown in Fig. 1,\nnamely for Ish = 0.3 and \u03b8 = 1.25. The diagram, with\nthree branches, looks qualitatively equivalent to the case\nof a homogeneous pump and operations such as switching\non and off the CS can be performed in a similar way. For\nexample, with the system at the fundamental solution,\n\n\f3\nH\n\nC\n\nV\n\nSNIC\n\nV\n\nSN2\n\nIII\n\nII\n\nSNSL\nIC\nSN\n\nH\n\nSN\nSL\n\nIV\n\nSN2\n\nC\n\nIII\n\nII\n\nIV\nSL\n\nSN\n\nSNSL\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFIG. 2: Two-parameter Is vs. \u03b8 phase diagram for Ish =\n0.3. Bifurcation lines are: SN (Saddle-Node); H (Hopf); SL\n(Saddle-Loop); SNIC (Saddle-Node on the Invariant Circle);\nSN2 (Saddle-Node off invariant cycle). Regions delimited by\nbifurcation lines are as follows. I: only the fundamental solution is stable; II: stationary stable CS coexisting with the\nfundamental one; III: oscillating CS (or oscillons), coexisting with the fundamental solution; IV: excitable region; V:\noscillating CS (with no other coexisting solution).\n\nthe upper branch CS can be switched on by applying\nan additional transient localized beam or equivalently by\ntemporarily increasing Ish\nA relevant difference is that for an homogeneous pump\nthe lowest branch (homogeneous solution) extends until\nthe MI at Is = 1, while in the case considered here the\nfundamental solution merges with the middle branch CS\nbefore the MI, in a saddle-node bifurcation (that happens at Is = 0.8479, SN point in Fig. 1). To understand\nqualitatively this phenomenon one has to take into account that the homogeneous pump case has many symmetries, some of which are broken when a localized pump\nis applied. In technical parlance one says that the bifurcation has become imperfect (see, e.g., [30], with the\nconsequence that a gap in Is appears making the lower\nbranch disconnected in two branches (the right part of\nthe branch is not plotted in Fig. 1 and correspond to\nsolutions unstable to extended patterns).\nExploring now the upper branches, in Fig. 1 past the\nsaddle-node bifurcation at Is = 0.6857 (SN point), a pair\nof stationary (stable, upper branch, and unstable, middle\nbranch) localized solutions in the form of CS are found.\nIn this parameter region, these structures are not essentially different to the solutions found in the homogeneous\ncase [24]. Increasing Is the stable high-amplitude CS undergoes a Hopf bifurcation.\nOverall, the scenario found for a localized pump is\nmuch more involved than in the case of the homogeneous\ncase, and more types of behavior are found in this case.\nFig. 2 shows a phase diagram for a fixed value of the\nlocalized pump Ish = 0.3. One can compare this figure\n\nFIG. 3: Two-parameter Is vs. \u03b8 phase diagram for Ish = 0.7.\nLine and region labeling as in Fig. 2.\n\nwith Fig. 1 in Ref. [24], corresponding to Ish = 0. The\neffect of breaking the translational symmetry would be\nto unfold some of the lines at Is = 1 (not visible in Fig. 1\nof Ref. [24]), that are degenerate with the MI line, and\nalso make the SN line end at Is < 1 (point C in Fig. 2).\nThus, the effect of a localized pump is to push down the\nSN2-SNIC line (to be explained later), as is clear from\nFig. 3, that provides a similar plot for Ish = 0.7.\nSome of the most prominent features of these figures,\ncomparing with the homogeneous pump case, associated\nto the appearance of the SNIC line (to be discussed in\nmore detail in Sec. IV) are that the excitable region, IV\nin Figs. 2-3, can have two types of excitable behavior\n(see Sec. V), both of Class I, as two different transitions\nto oscillatory behavior are possible, saddle-loop (SL) and\nSNIC. In addition, one has a new region, V, in which one\nhas a single attractor in the system, that is oscillatory,\nto be distinguished from region III, in which the system\nexhibits bistability [41], between the (stationary) fundamental solution and an oscillatory upper branch CS.\nThese behaviors, and how they are organized by three\ncodimension-2 points will the subject of Sections VI-VII.\n\nIV.\n\nSADDLE-NODE ON THE INVARIANT\nCIRCLE BIFURCATION\n\nA saddle-node on the invariant circle bifurcation\n(SNIC), also known as saddle-node infinite-period\n(SNIPER) and as saddle-node central homoclinic bifurcation, is a special case of a saddle-node bifurcation that\noccurs inside a limit cycle. Although this bifurcation\nis local in (one-dimensional) flows on the circle, it has\nglobal features in higher-dimensional dynamical systems\n[30], so it is also termed local-global or semilocal. In\nparticular, the (stable) manifolds of the saddle and node\nfixed points transverse to the center manifold are orga-\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4: Period of the limit cycle T as a function of Is for\nIsh = 0.3 and \u03b8 = 1.45. Inset: 1/T 2 vs. Is close to the\nbifurcation point.\n\nnized by an unstable focus inside the limit cycle. At one\nside of the bifurcation the system exhibits oscillatory behavior, while at the other side the dynamics of the system\nis excitable. This mechanism leading to excitability has\nbeen found in several (zero dimensional) optical systems\n[31, 32, 33].\nWhen approaching the bifurcation from the oscillatory\nside the period lengthens and becomes infinite. Quantitatively the period as a function of a parameter exhibits\na inverse square root singular law [30],\nT \u221d [Is2 \u2212 (Isc )2 ]\u22121/2 .\n\n(4)\n\nThis can be used to distinguish the SNIC from other\nbifurcations leading to oscillatory behavior (e.g. from the\nsaddle-loop bifurcation with a logarithmic singular law\n[23, 24, 30]). Fig. 4 shows the period of the oscillations\nas a function of Is obtained by numerical simulations of\nEq. (1). In the inset of Fig. 4 we plot 1/T 2 vs. Is2 close\nto the bifurcation point. The linear dependence obtained\ncorroborates the scaling law and that the transition takes\nplace through a SNIC bifurcation.\nThe overall route exhibited by the system along a vertical cut in Fig. 2 at \u03b8 = 1.45 is illustrated in Fig. 5, as\nthe parameter Is is decreased from the top to the bottom of the Figure. Thus, the figure shows the transition from oscillatory behavior (top panel) to stationary\n(fourth panel) through the occurrence of a SNIC bifurcation (third panel). Lengthening of the period can be seen\nin the second panel. The sketches shown in the right column of Fig. 5 illustrate the structure of the phase space.\nThe validity of this scenario is further reinforced with the\nquantitative analysis presented in Section VII.\n\nV.\n\nEXCITABILITY\n\nAn interesting aspect of this scenario is that in region\nIV one can have excitable behavior through two different\n\nFIG. 5: (Color Online) Time evolution of the CS amplitude\nfor Ish = 0.3, \u03b8 = 1.45 and decreasing values of Is . From top\nto bottom, Is = 0.927, 0.907, 0.8871, 0.8. In the bottom panel\nthe dashed line corresponds to the amplitude of the unstable\nCS (saddle) while dot-dashed line corresponds to the stable\nfundamental solution. These two solutions coincide when the\nSNIC bifurcation takes place (third panel). The sketches on\nthe right illustrate the phase space dynamics.\n\nmechanisms. On the one hand, and similarly to the behavior analyzed in Refs. [23, 24], close enough to the SL\nline one has excitability if the fundamental solution is appropriately excited such that the oscillatory behavior existing beyond the SL is transiently recreated. The second\nmechanism takes place close to the SNIC line, where the\noscillatory behavior that is transiently recreated is that\nof the oscillations in region V. Both excitable behaviors\nexhibit a response starting at zero frequency (or infinite\nperiod), as both bifurcations are mediated by a saddle,\nwhose stable manifold is the threshold beyond which perturbations must be applied to excite the system. In neuroscience terminology, both excitable behaviors are class\n(or type) I [34, 35], although there are important differences between them. The SNIC mediated excitability is\neasier to observe than the one associated to a saddle-loop\nbifurcation for two reasons. First, it occurs in a broader\nparameter range due to its square-root scaling law (4),\nwith respect to the SL excitability [42]. Second the excitable threshold can be controlled by the intensity of the\nlocalized Gaussian beam, that effectively approaches the\nfixed point and the saddle in phase space, allowing to\nreduce the threshold as much as desired (by approaching\nthe SNIC line). Within region IV one can find a typical\ncrossover behavior for the threshold, as it increases from\nzero (at the SNIC line) to the (finite) value characteristic\nof the SL bifurcation as one approaches this line.\nFig. 6 shows the dynamics of the excitable fundamental\nsolution in region IV, namely for the parameters corresponding to the fourth panel in Fig. 5, upon the appli-\n\n\f5\n\nH\n\nC\n\nSN2\nII\n\nI\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Evolution of the maximum of the field\namplitude after applying a localized perturbation to the fundamental solution. The perturbation has the shape of the\nunstable stationary CS (saddle), that is scaled by 0.95 (blue\ndashed line); 1.01 green solid line) and 1.1 (red dotted line).\nHere Ish = 0.3, Is = 0.8, and \u03b8 = 1.45.\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Transverse profile of |E| at different\ntimes of the dotted line in Fig. 6.\n\ncation of different localized perturbations, one below the\nexcitable threshold and two above. As expected, the perturbation below threshold relaxes directly to the fundamental solution while the above threshold perturbations\nelicit first a large response of the system in the form of an\nexcitable soliton which finally relaxes to the fundamental\nsolution. The excitable excursion takes place at a later\ntime as the smaller is the distance to the threshold (a\nsignature of Class I excitability). Finally, the shape of\nan excitable excursion in two-dimensional space is shown\nin Fig. 7.\n\nVI.\n\nCUSP CODIMENSION-2 POINT\n\nIn the two-parameter phase diagrams in Figs. 2-3 one\ncan see a point marked with a 'C' that was not found in\n\nSN\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) The fundamental solution for three\npoints in the (Is , \u03b8) parameter space, for Ish = 0.3, around\nthe Cusp codimension-2 point. The coordinates are (bottom\nto top): Ish = 0.7, \u03b8 = 0.9; Ish = 0.85, \u03b8 = 0.85, Ish =\n0.95, \u03b8 = 0.95.\n\nthe homogeneous case [43]. This point represents a Cusp\ncodimension-2 bifurcation point [36], namely a point in\nwhich two saddle-node curves merge. This cusp point,\nthat involves only stationary (saddle-node) bifurcations,\nis also known as the Cusp Catastrophe [37]. For parameter values just at the left of the Cusp the bump of the\nfundamental solution exhibits a rapid increase. Fig. 8\nshows the sharp, but smooth, change in the shape of the\nfundamental solution for three parameter values around\nthe cusp point within region I. Instead, if one is to the\nright of the 'C' point this increase cannot be accommodated smoothly and a double fold occurs, such that three\nbranches appear: two stable, upper and lower branches,\nand one unstable, middle branch, and thus bistability\nmakes its appearance. The two folds, codim-1, merge\ncritically at the cusp point, codim-2. Decreasing Ish the\nCusp moves up towards Is = 1, so in the limit of homogeneous pump it can not be seen due to the presence of\nthe MI instability. The smooth connection between the\nfundamental branch and the upper branch exhibiting CS\nis an outcome of the symmetry breaking induced by the\nlocalized pump which has made the MI bifurcation to\nbecome imperfect.\nVII.\n\nSADDLE-NODE SEPARATRIX-LOOP\nCODIMENSION-2 POINT\n\nThe subject of the present section is to discuss the\npoint designated with 'SNSL' (that stands for SaddleNode Separatrix Loop [34, 38] (also called Saddle-Node\nnoncentral Homoclinic bifurcation and saddle-node homoclinic orbit bifurcation [35]) in Figs. 2-3. A SNSL is a\nlocal-global codimension-2 point in which a saddle-node\nbifurcation takes place simultaneously to a saddle-loop,\nsuch that the orbit enters through the noncentral (stable)\nmanifold. The unfolding of a SNSL point leads to the scenario depicted in Fig. 9. There is a line of saddle-node bifurcations (in which a pair of stable/unstable fixed points\n\n\f6\nSNSL\nSN2\n\nSNIC\n\nSL\n\nFIG. 9: Sketch of the parameter space near the SNSL point,\nshowing the unfolding of bifurcation lines, and adapted to the\ngeometry in Figs. 2-3.\n\nare created) that at one side of the SNSL is a saddle-node\nbifurcation off limit cycle (SN2) while at the other side\nis a SNIC bifurcation (the saddle-node occurs inside the\nlimit cycle). A saddle-loop (SL) bifurcation also unfolds\nfrom the SNSL point, tangent to the SN2 line. From the\nother side, a special curve depicted with a dotted line\nin Fig. 9 should appear (cf. Fig. 22 in Ref. [34]). It is\nnot a bifurcation line, but instead it is a special line in\nwhich the approach to the node point is through the most\nstable direction, namely the direction transverse to the\ncentral manifold at the SNIC/SN2 (and SNSL) bifurcations (for these reasons we also call this dotted line the\n'pseudo-bifurcation' line). This, in principle nongeneric,\ncurve, that emerges in the unfolding of the SNSL point,\nis necessary for consistency on the excursions around the\nSNSL codimension-2 point. At the pseudo-bifurcation\nthe topological cycle is reconstructed, namely the stable\nfundamental solution and the middle branch CS (saddle),\nbecome points belonging to the circle that latter will become the limit cycle. Before the pseudo-bifurcation the\nunstable manifold of the saddle enters towards the stable\nsolution from the same side than the saddle, while after\nthe pseudo-bifurcation it enters from the opposite side.\nThe SNSL point separates two possible ways in which\nthe system can go from oscillatory region III (where the\nlimit cycle coexists with the stable fundamental solution)\nto oscillatory region V (where the fundamental solution\ndoes not exist).\nFor \u03b8 > \u03b8SNSL the scenario is as described in Section\nIV, namely the middle and lower branches coalesce in a\nSNIC bifurcation. The main feature of this bifurcation is\nthat it occurs on the limit cycle, leading to the excitable\nbehavior of region IV. This scenario can be confirmed using the mode projection technique described in the Appendix of Ref. [24], that allows to obtain in quantitative\nform the phase space of an extended system (described,\ne.g., by a PDE), that strictly has an infinite dimension,\nbut whose relevant dynamics is low-dimensional. In this\ncase, like in the case of a saddle-loop bifurcation stud-\n\nFIG. 10: Spectrum of the fundamental solution at the SNIC\nbifurcation for Ish = 0.7, Is = 0.707, and \u03b8 = 1.34 (close to\nthe SNSL).\n\nFIG. 11: Transverse cut of the most stable (left) and unstable\n(right) eigenmodes of the linear spectrum shown in Fig.10.\nThe solid (dashed) line indicates the real (imaginary) part of\nthe eigenmode.\n\nied in Ref. [24], we will argue that there are just two\nmodes that are relevant, at least in the region close to the\nSNSL codimension-2 point. Fig. 10 shows the spectrum\nof eigenvalues (linear stability analysis for the fundamental solution) at the SNIC bifurcation and close to the\nSNSL. The spectrum has a continuous part with eigenvalues lying along the line Re(\u03bb) = \u22121, and also a discrete\npart which is symmetric with the respect to this line.\nIt turns out that there are only two eigenmodes which\nare localized in space, while all the other eigenmodes are\nspatially extended. The two localized eigenmodes correspond to the most stable mode and to the one that\nbecomes unstable. These two modes, shown in Fig. 11,\nare the only relevant for the dynamics of the CS close to\nthe stable fixed point, since the projection of a localized\nsolution onto any of the extended modes is negligible.\nFig. 12 shows a quantitative reconstruction of the\nphase space. \u03b21 (\u03b22 ) corresponds to the amplitude of\nthe projection of the trajectory along the unstable (most\nstable) eigenmode. Panel a) represents a trajectory in\nthe excitable region IV, close to the SNSL and below\nthe pseudo-bifurcation line. Panel b) shows a zoom of\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 12: a) Full trajectory in the phase space close to the\nSNIC (Is = 0.863).

The excitable\ntrajectory departs form the saddle and after long excursion in phase space arrives to the fundamental solution\nfrom below (that is, from the side of the saddle). Notice\nthat while close to the fixed points the dynamics fits very\nwell in a 2-dimensional picture, away from them the lines\ncrosses, indicating that the full CS dynamics in phase\nspace is not confined to a plane. Panel c) corresponds\nto the pseudo-bifurcation, so that the trajectory arrives\nat the fundamental solution along the most stable direction. Panel d) is just after the pseudo-bifurcation with\nthe trajectory arriving from the other side. Finally panel\ne) corresponds to parameters in the oscillatory region V\njust after the SNIC bifurcation. Notice that the pseudobifurcation line is very close to the SNIC bifurcation since\nwe have taken parameters close to the SNSL and at the\nSNSL both lines originate tangentially. As expected, the\nquantitative picture agrees with the qualitatively picture\nas one crosses the SNIC bifurcation in the right panels of\nFig. 5.\nFor \u03b8 < \u03b8SN SL the scenario is quite different, as the\nmiddle and lower branches now coalesce off the limit cycle, SN2, what implies that the behavior of the system\nis oscillatory on both sides of the SN2 line, not excitable\n[44] and instead one crosses the SN2 line. This means\nthat one is in a bistable oscillatory regime, and in crossing the SN2 line a saddle-node off the invariant cycle\nbifurcation occurs. SN2 involves the middle and fundamental branches (while SN involves the upper and middle\nbranches). So, in the end this nothing else that another\nway of entering region V, of monostable oscillatory behavior, but instead of reconstructing the limit cycle, here\n\nthe fundamental stationary solution is destroyed.\nTherefore, and having in mind the behavior for \u03b8 \u2192\n\u221e discussed in previous work for homogeneous pump\n[23, 24], the overall scenario depicted in Figs. 2-3 is organized by three codimension-2 points: a Cusp point,\nfrom which two saddle-node bifurcations emerge (SN and\nSN2); a SNSL point from which a SNIC line emerges,\nand that organizes the SN2 and SL lines around; and\na Takens-Bodgdanov point, occurring apparently at infinite detuning, where the SN, Hopf and SL are tangent,\nand that can be seen as the birth of both the Hopf and\nSL lines. The Takens-Bogdanov point was numerically\nshown to be present in the homogeneous case [23, 24].\nIt is reassuring that the saddle-loop bifurcation line connects two of the codimension-2 points, as it is not in\nsome sense generic, [45] and one does not expect that\nit emerges out of the blue sky. The scenario composed\nby these three codimension-2 bifurcations has been reported in other systems [39], and from a theoretical point\nof view, it can be shown that it appears in the unfolding in 2-dimensional parameter space of a codimension-3\ndegenerate Takens-Bogdanov point [40].\nIn the limit of homogeneous pump the SN2 and SNIC\nlines approach the MI line at Is = 1, which, therefore, also contains the Cusp and the SNSL codimension-2\npoints. At the Cusp the SN (responsible for the existence\nof CS) originates while at the SNSL the SL (originated\nat the Takens-Bogdanov and responsible of the CS excitability observed for homogeneous pump) ends. Notice\nthat for homogeneous pump close to Is = 1 azimuthal\ninstabilities renders the CS unstable to a pattern so it is\ndifficult to study the SN and specially the SL lines in that\nregion. Using a localized pump and then taking the limit\nto homogeneous pump circumvents these limitations.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a detailed study of the instabilities\nof solitons in nonlinear Kerr cavities under the application of a localized Gaussian beam. Since experimentally\nCS are typically switched on by applying a transient addressing beam the situation discussed here can be realized\njust applying it on a permanent basis. The CS are sustained by a balance between nonlinearity and dissipation,\nas in the case of a homogeneous pump, although now\nthese effects interact with the localized pump. The localized pump helps to spatially fixed the CS and to control\nsome of its dynamical properties. After the saddle-node\nbifurcation that creates the CS, it starts oscillating and\noverall exhibit a plethora of bifurcations that are shown\nto be organized by three codimension-2 points: a TakensBogdanov point, (which is also present for homogeneous\npump as discussed already in [23, 24]), a Cusp, and a\nSaddle-Node Separatrix Loop (SNSL) points. In this\nscenario a saddle-loop bifurcation connects the TakensBogdanov and the SNSL and the Cusp is connected to\nthe other codimension-2 bifurcations by two saddle-node\n\n\f8\nlines. A line of SNIC bifurcations originates at the SNSL\nwhile at the Takens-Bogdanov a Hopf bifurcation line\nmeets tangentially a saddle-node and the saddle-loop\nlines.\nThe simultaneously presence in the system of two\nbifurcations that are associated to excitable behavior\n(saddle-loop and SNIC) enriches and completes the picture discussed for the case of a homogeneous pump. In\nfact the region for which excitable behavior is reported,\nin which the only attractor in the system is the fundamental solution, leads to two different Class I behaviors\n(starting at infinite period). In the excitable region one\ngoes smoothly from no threshold at the onset of the SNIC\nline to a finite threshold at the onset of the saddle-loop\nline. In fact, the excitable behavior mediated by a SNIC,\nand reported in this work, should be easier to observe\nboth numerically and experimentally, and present some\npractical features that make it more suitable for practi-\n\ncal applications. In particular, the excitable threshold\ncan be controlled by the intensity of the localized beam.\nWith an array of properly engineered beams, created for\ninstance with a spatial light modulator, one could create\nreconfigurable arrays of coupled excitable units to alloptically process information. Work in this direction will\nbe reported elsewhere.\n\n[1] S. Koga and Y. Kuramoto, Prog. Theor. Phys. 392, 106\n(1980).\n[2] B. S. Kerner and V. V.
