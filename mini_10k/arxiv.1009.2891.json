Considering the universe as a thermodynamical system the second law\nof black hole dynamics extends to the non-negativity of the sum of the entropy of the matter and the\nhorizon, known as generalized second law of thermodynamics(GSLT). Here, we have assumed the\nuniverse to be bounded by the event-horizon where Bekenstein entropy-area relation and Hawkingtemperature are not applicable. Thus considering entropy to be an arbitrary function of the area\nof the event-horizon, we have tried to find the nature of the entropy-function for the validity of the\nGSLT both in quintessence-era and in phantom-era. Finally, some graphical representation of the\nentropy-function has been presented.\n\nIn black hole physics, semi-classical description shows that just like a black body , black hole emits thermal\nradiation (known as Hawking radiation) and it completes the missing link between a black hole and a thermodynamical system. The temperature (known as the Hawking temperature) and the entropy (known as Bekenstein\nentropy) are proportional to the surface gravity at the horizon and area of the horizon [1, 2] respectively (i.e.\nrelated to the geometry of the horizon). Also this temperature , entropy and mass of the black hole satisfy\nthe first law of thermodynamics [3]. As a result , physicists start speculating about the relationship between\nthe black hole thermodynamics and Einstein's field equations (describing the geometry of space time). It is\nJacobson [4] who first derived Einstein field equations from the first law of thermodynamics: \u03b4Q = T dS for all\nlocal Rindler causal horizons with \u03b4Q and T as the energy flux and Unruh temperature seen by an accelerated\nobserver just inside the horizon. Then Padmanabhan [5] was able to formulate the first law of thermodynamics\non the horizon, starting from Einstein equations for a general static spherically symmetric space time. The\nfollowing nice equivalence\nLaws of thermodynamics \u21d4 Analogous laws of black hole dynamics(Semi classical analysis)\n\u21d4 Einstein f ield equations(gravity theory) (classical treatment)\nperhaps shows the strongest evidence for a fundamental connection between quantum physics and gravity.\nSubsequently, this identity between Einstein equations and thermodynamical laws has been applied in the\ncosmological context considering universe as a thermodynamical system bounded by the apparent horizon\n\u03c0R2A\n1\n(RA ). Using the Hawking temperature TA = 2\u03c0R\nand\nBekenstein\nentropy\nS\n=\nA\nG at the apparent horizon,\nA\nthe first law of thermodynamics (on the apparent horizon) is shown to be equivalent to Friedmann equations [6]\nand the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) is obeyed at the horizon. Also in higher dimensional\nspace time the relation was established for gravity with Gauss-Bonnet term and for the Lovelock gravity theory\n([7],[8], [9]).\nBut difficulty arises if we consider universe to be bounded by event horizon. First of all, in the usual\nstandard big bang model cosmological event horizon does not exists. However the cosmological event horizon\nseparates from that of the apparent horizon only for the accelerating phase of the universe (dominated by dark\nenergy). Further, Wang et.al. [10] have shown that both first and second law of thermodynamics break down\nat the event horizon, considering the usual definition of temperature and entropy as in the apparent horizon.\nAccording to them the applicability of the first law of thermodynamics is restricted to nearby states of local\nthermodynamic equilibrium while event horizon reflects the global features of space time. Also due to existence\nof the cosmological event horizon, the universe should be non-static in nature and as a result the usual definition\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\nschakraborty@math.jdvu.ac.in\nnairwita15@gmail.com\nbiswas.ritabrata@gmail.com\n\n\f2\nof the thermodynamical quantities on the event horizon may not be as simple as in the static space-time. They\nhave considered the universe bounded by the apparent horizon as a Bekenstein system as Bekenstein's entropymass bound : S \u2264 2\u03c0RA and entropy-area bound:S \u2264 A\n4 are valid in this region. These Bekenstein bounds\nare universal in nature and all gravitationally stable special regions with weak self gravity satisfy Bekenstein\nbounds. Finally, they have argued that as event horizon is larger than the apparent horizon so the universe\nbounded by the event horizon is not a Bekenstein system.\nIn the literature, there are lot of works [11\u201318], dealing with thermodynamics of the universe bounded by\nthe apparent horizon as it is a Bekenstein system. On the other hand, due to the above complicated nature\nof the thermodynamical system : universe bounded by the event horizon (UBEH), there are few works related\nto it. Recently, Mazumder et. al. [19, 20], starting from the first law of thermodynamics, have examined the\nvalidity of the GSLT which states that the time variation of the sum of the entropy of the horizon (SH ) and\nd\nthe entropy of the matter inside it (SI ) should be positive definite , i.e., dt\n(SH + SI ) \u2265 0. Without assuming\nany specific choice for the entropy and the temperature on the event horizon, they are able to show the validity\nof the GSLT with some restrictions on the matter. In the present work, we try to speculate the nature of the\nentropy function on the event horizon assuming the validity of the GSLT. It should be noted that the reason\nto stress the validity of GSLT is that it is an universal law, holds in any generality, irrespective of whether the\nthermodynamical system is an equilibrium or in a non-equilibrium one.\nWe start with homogeneous and isotropic FRW model of the universe having line element\n\nwhere r\u0303 = ar is the area radius, hab\n\nds2 = hab dxa dxb + \u0303r2 d\u03a922\n(1)\n\u0010\n\u0011\na2\n= diag \u22121, 1\u2212kr\nwith k = 0, \u00b1 1 for a flat, closed and open model and\n2\n\nd\u03a922 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 is the metric on unit 2-sphere. The Friedmann equations are\nk\n8\u03c0G\u03c1\n=\na2\n3\n\n(2)\n\nk\n= \u22124\u03c0G (\u03c1 + p)\na2\n\n(3)\n\nH2 +\nand\n\u1e22 \u2212\nwith energy conservation equation\n\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3H (\u03c1 + p) = 0\n\n(4)\n\nThe apparent horizon, a null surface is characterized by\nhab \u2202a r\u0303\u2202b r\u0303 = 0\nand hence the radius of the apparent horizon has the expression\n1\nRA = q\nH2 +\n\nk\na2\n\n(5)\n\nOn the other hand, the radius of the cosmological event horizon (which exists for accelerating model of the\nuniverse in Einstein gravity) is given by,\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\ndt\nda\nRE = a\n(6)\n=a\na\nHa2\nt\na\nAs,\nRH =\n\n1\nH\n\n(7)\n\nis the radius of the Hubble horizon, so depending on the curvature the horizons are related by the following\nrelations\n(I) k = 0 :\nRA =\n\n1\n= RH < RE\nH\n\n\f3\n(II) k = \u22121 :\nRH < RA < RE\n(III) k = +1 :\nEither, RA < RE < RH\nor, RA < RH < RE\nIn reference [19, 20], Mazumder et. al. have assumed the validity of the first law of thermodynamics at the\nevent horizon (i.e., the Clausius relation \u2212dE = TE dSE ) where the amount of energy crossing the event horizon\nduring the infinitesimal time dt is given by\n3\n\u2212 dE = 4\u03c0RE\nH (\u03c1 + p) dt\n\n(8)\n\nHere the change in the horizon entropy during the small time dt is\ndSE =\n\n3\n4\u03c0RE\nH\n(p + \u03c1) dt\nTE\n\n(9)\n\nwhere (SE , TE ) are the entropy and temperature of the event horizon and (\u03c1, p) are energy density and\nthermodynamic pressure of the fluid bounded by the event horizon.\nNow, to calculate the variation of the matter entropy we shall use the Gibb's equation ([21])\nTE dSI = dEI + pdV\n\n(10)\n\nwhere SI and EI are the entropy and the energy of the matter distribution respectively. One may note that for\nthermodynamical equilibrium, the temperature of the matter is chosen as that of the event horizon (i.e., TE ).\nAs\nV =\n\n4 3\n4\u03c0 3\n\u03c0RE , EI =\n\u03c1RE\n3\n3\n\n(11)\n\nso from the Gibb's equation (10) and using the energy conservation relation (4) the variation of matter entropy\nhas the expression\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n(12)\ndSI = 4\u03c0RE\n(\u03c1 + p) \u1e58E \u2212 HRE dt\nDifferentiating the relation (6) for RE , we get\n\u1e58E = (HRE \u2212 1)\nHence combining equations (9) and (12) using (13), the time variation of the total entropy is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nR2 H\nd\nRE \u2212\n(SE + SI ) = 4\u03c0 (\u03c1 + p) E\ndt\nTE\nH\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nBased on the above calculation Mazumder et. al. [19, 20] has obtained the following restrictions for validity of\nd\nGSLT (i.e., dt\n(SE + SI ) \u2265 0)\n(i) For flat and open FRW universe the GSLT is valid if the weak energy condition \u03c1 + p > 0 is satisfied.\n(ii) For a closed model, the validity of the GSLT demands either the weak energy condition is satisfied and\n1\nRA < H1 < RE or the weak energy condition is violated and RA < RE < H\n.\n(iii) For validity of GSLT, no specific form of entropy or temperature on the event horizon is needed.\nHere in this present paper, the thermodynamical study is rather in a opposite way. We start with validity of\nGSLT and infer about properties of the entropy function. In analogy with Bekenstein's entropy-area relation,\nwe assume the functional form of the entropy at the event horizon be\nSE =\n\nf (A)\n4G\n\n(15)\n\n\f4\n2\nwith A = 4\u03c0RE\n, the area of the event horizon. So,\n\ndSE\nf \u2032 (A)\n=\n2\u03c0RE \u1e58E\ndt\nG\n\n(16)\n\nwhere 'dash' denotes differentiation with respect to \u2032 A\u2032 . Thus using the expression (12) for variation of matter\nentropy, the time variation of the total entropy is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd\n(HRE \u2212 1) \u2032\n2RE\n(\u03c1 + p)\n(SE + SI ) = 2\u03c0RE\nf (A) \u2212\ndt\nG\nTI\n\n(17)\n\nwhere TI is the temperature of the matter distribution and we have TI = TE for equilibrium thermodynamics.\nNow we shall examine the validity of GSLT in (a) quintessence era and (b) phantom era.\n(a)In quintessence era, weak energy condition (\u03c1 + p > 0)is satisfied and so according to Davies [22] R \u0307E > 0\ni.e. RE > H1 . So from equations (12) (using (13)) and (16) horizon entropy will increase provided f \u2032 (A) > 0\nwhile the matter entropy is decreasing with time. Thus GSLT will be satisfied provided the expression within\nthe square bracket in equation (17) is positive .\n(b) On the other hand, in phantom era, there is a violation of weak energy condition (\u03c1 + p < 0) and Sadjadi\n[23] R \u0307E < 0 i.e. RE < H1 . So matter entropy will always increase and horizon entropy will increase or decrease\ndepending on f \u2032 (A) < 0 or f \u2032 (A) > 0 and as before the expression within the square bracket in equation (17)\nshould be positive for validity of GSLT.\nTherefore, for the validity of GSLT, the entropy function f(A) must have the following characteristic :\n(a) In quintessence era :- f(A) is an increasing function of A ,i.e., RE such that\nf \u2032 (A) >\n\n2RE G (\u03c1 + p)\nTI (HRE \u2212 1)\n\n(18)\n\n(b)In phantom era: Either f(A) is still an increasing function of A with\n0 < f \u2032 (A) <\n\n2RE G (\u03c1 + p)\n.\nTI\nHRE \u2212 1\n\n(19)\n\nor f (A) is decreasing function of A i.e. f \u2032 (A) < 0 and GLST is identically satisfied in that era.\nTo have smooth entropy function across the phantom barrier one must have f \u2032 (A) = 0 on the barrier. As a\nresult both matter and horizon entropy becomes constant on the phantom crossing. Thus the entropy function\nhas either of the two possible behavior:\nI. The entropy function increases sharply in the quintessence era so that the expression within the square\nbracket in equation (17) must have positive value to satisfy GLST and then f (A) reaches a maximum at the\nphantom crossing, subsequently slowly decreases in the phantom era so that GSLT is satisfied there. We\nspeculate that the graph of the entropy function throughout the quintessence and phantom era will be as in\nthe figure I with a maxima at phantom crossing.\nII. The entropy function increases in both quintessence and phantom era with a point of inflexion at the\nphantom crossing as shown in FigII.\nNow we shall examine whether the Bekenstein entropy-area relation is valid on the event horizon. From the\ninequalities (18) and (19) to have GSLT on the event horizon with Bekenstein entropy, the temperature of the\nmatter distribution should satisfy\nTI > or < 2RE G\n\n(\u03c1 + p)\nHRE \u2212 1\n\nin quintessence or phantom era respectively. This temperature bound is quite distinct from Hawking temperature and we have non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Finally, one may note that throughout the calculation\n\n\f5\n1.2\n1.02\n1.01\n\n1.1\n\n1\n\nf\n\nf\n\n1.15\n\n0.99\n\n1.05\n0.98\n1\n\n0.97\n\n0.95\n\n0.96\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n0\n\n500\n\nA\n\nFig.I\n\n1000\n\n1500\nA\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nFig.II\n\nFigI. and FigII. shows the variation of the entropy function with the area function\n\nno specific Einstein field equations have been used, only the equation of continuity is needed to calculate the\nvariation of matter entropy.
