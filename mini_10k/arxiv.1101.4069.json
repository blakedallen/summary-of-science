We show how obstructions to some standard deformation\nproblems arise as the classes of torsors under and gerbes banded by this sheaf.\nThis generalizes results of Quillen, Rim, and Gaitsgory.\n\n1. Introduction\nIf f : X \u2192 Y is a smooth morphism of schemes, and Y \u2032 is a square-zero\nextension of Y such that the ideal of Y in Y \u2032 is OY , then the square-zero\nextensions X \u2032 of X over Y \u2032 are obstructed by a class \u03c9 \u2208 H 2 (X, TX/Y ), where\nTX/Y is the relative tangent bundle. Should this class vanish, deformations form\na torsor under H 1 (X, TX/Y ) and automorphisms of any fixed deformation are\nin bijection with H 0 (X, TX/Y ).\nThis may be explained succinctly by allowing X to vary in the definition of\nthe deformation problem: the deformations of open subsets of X form a gerbe\nover X, banded by TX/Y . The obstruction \u03c9 is then the class of this gerbe.\nIf \u03c9 vanishes, the gerbe is trivial, meaning it is isomorphic to the classifying\nstack of TX/Y -torsors, and then the statements regarding isomorphism classes\nand automorphisms come from the cohomological classification of torsors.\nIf we relax the hypothesis that f be smooth, the above argument fails, but\na similar description of obstructions, deformations and automorphisms persists\n[Il71, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 2.1.7]: letting LX/Y denote the cotangent complex of X over\nY , there is an obstruction \u03c9 \u2208 Ext2 (LX/Y , OX ) whose vanishing is equivalent\nto the existence of a deformation; if a deformation exists, all deformations form\n1 Present address: Department of Mathematics, Stanford University, 450 Serra Mall, Building 380, Stanford, CA, USA 94305\nE-mail address: jonathan@math.stanford.edu\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\nMay 29, 2018\n\n\fa torsor under Ext1 (LX/Y , OX ) and automorphisms of any given solution are\nin bijection with Ext0 (LX/Y , OX ).\nThe strong resemblance between this result and the one obtained in the\nsmooth case hints that there may still be a relationship between deformations\nand banded gerbes. Moreover, it is only the \"local triviality\" aspect of a gerbe\nthat fails to apply in the non-smooth case: the solutions to the deformation problem still form a pseudo-gerbe banded by TX/Y , in the sense that isomorphisms\nbetween any two solutions form a pseudo-torsor under TX/Y , but solutions are\nnot guaranteed to exist locally, and pairs of solutions are not guaranteed to be\nlocally isomorphic. In other words, the failure of the \"gerbe argument\" in the\nnon-smooth case may be attributed to the fact that the deformation problem is\nnot locally trivial in the Zariski topology on X.\nAll of this suggests that Illusie's result may be interpreted in terms of gerbes\nif we can find a topology finer than the Zariski topology in which the deformation problem becomes locally trivial. For affine schemes, such a topology\nwas defined, apparently simultaneously, by Quillen [Qu70] and Rim [SGA7-1,\nVI.3].2 Rim speculated [SGA7-1, VI.3.16] that it might be possible to define an\nanalogous topology for arbitrary schemes, and Quillen apparently made such a\ndefinition [Il10] but never published it. In [Ga97], Gaitsgory defined a topology\non the category of associative algebras on a scheme and showed that it is fine\nenough to find local trivializations of deformation problems associated to quasicoherent algebras. As Gaitsgory notes [Ga97, Section 0.4], his methods may be\nadapted easily to the commutative case, where they can be used to treat the\nrelative deformation theory of a scheme that is affine over the base. We note,\nhowever, that if f : X \u2192 Y is a morphism of schemes then OX is, in general, not\nquasi-coherent as a f \u22121 OY -algebra, so Gaitsgory's results do not apply directly\nto the deformation theory of schemes.\nThe introduction of banded gerbes to explain the obstruction to the existence of algebra extensions is due to Gaitsgory [Ga95]. That deformations, when\nthey exist, can be viewed as torsors was observed by Quillen [Qu70, Proposition 2.4 (iv)].\nIn this paper, we will define a new topology on the category of all commutative rings in a topos and show that it is fine enough to trivialize the standard\ndeformation problems about commutative rings, but is still coarse enough to\nglue their solutions. We obtain cohomological obstructions to the existence\nof solutions to these problems and a cohomological description of the solutions,\nshould they exist. As we explain in Section 2, this can be used to apply the ideas\nof Gaitsgory, Quillen and Rim to the deformation theory of schemes. We also\ncompare our approach to cotangent cohomology with Illusie's, showing that our\n2 Quillen attributed his definition to Grothendieck with a pre-publication reference to SGA4\nthat I could not trace. It may be that Quillen was only crediting Grothendieck with the idea\nof using the topology generated by universal effective epimorphisms, and not specifically for\nthe definition of the cotangent cohomology in this way. On the other hand, Quillen's topology\nis identical to Rim's, so it may also be that Quillen intended to refer to Rim's expos\u00e9 in SGA7.\n\n2\n\n\fobstruction groups agree with his. We will complete this comparison in [Wi11]\nby showing that the obstruction classes agree as well.\nThe ideas in this paper may be applied easily to similar deformation problems\nof other algebraic objects. We leave these applications to the reader for now.\nWe hope to explain some of them (such as stable maps and sheaves of modules)\nin future work. In [Wi11], we will explain how the theory developed here can be\nused in place of sheaves of simplicial commutative rings to develop the standard\nproperties of the cotangent complex [Il71, II.2].\n2. Summary of results\nIn this section we shall state our results in the context of schemes in order to\ngive them a geometric appearance; statements in the generality of ringed topoi\nfollow in the body of the text. In order to deduce the statements about schemes\ngiven in this section from the algebraic statements that follow, one need only\nobserve that infinitesimal extensions of a scheme are equivalent to infinitesimal\nextensions of their structure sheaves, in either the Zariski or \u00e9tale topology.\nSuppose that f : X \u2192 Y is a morphism of Z-schemes, and consider the\nproblem of extending f to a fixed square-zero extension X \u2032 of X over Z with\nideal J (cf. [Il71, Probl\u00e8me III.2.2.1.2]). Diagramattically, we are attempting to\ncomplete the commutative diagram of solid arrows\nX\n\u000f\u000f }\nX\u2032\n\n}\n\n}\n\n// Y\n}>>\n\u000f\u000f\n// Z\n\nwith a dashed arrow making both triangles commute. In Section 5, we shall\ndefine a site g \u22121 OZ \u2212Alg/f \u22121 OY , which we show in Section 6 is fine enough to\nensure that the deformation problem is locally trivial. In the statement of the\ntheorem, we abbreviate the name of the site to OZ \u2212Alg/OY .\nTheorem. The extensions HomX (X \u2032 , Y ) of f to f \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2192 Y form a torsor\non OZ \u2212Alg/OY under the sheaf of abelian groups DerOZ (OY , J) (defined in\nSection 6). The class of this torsor in H 1 (OZ \u2212Alg/OY , DerOZ (Oy , J)) obstructs\nthe existence of a lift. Provided that the obstruction vanishes, all lifts form a\ntorsor under DerOZ (OY , J).\nNow consider a morphism of schemes f : X \u2192 Y and a fixed extension Y \u2032\nof Y with ideal I. Also assume given a homomorphism \u03c6 : f \u2217 I \u2192 J for some\nquasi-coherent sheaf J on X. We search for a completion of the diagram\nX _ _ _// X\u001f \u2032\n\u001f f\u2032\n\u001f\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\u000f\n/\n/\nY\nY\u2032\n3\n\n(1)\n\n\fin which X \u2032 is a square-zero extension of X by the ideal J and the induced\n\u2217\nmorphism f \u2032 I \u2192 J coincides with \u03c6 (cf. [Il71, Probl\u00e8me III.2.1.2.1]). We\nshow in Section 8 that this deformation problem also becomes locally trivial in\nf \u22121 OY \u2212Alg/OX . Once again abbreviating the name of the site to OY /\u2212Alg/OX ,\nwe obtain\nTheorem. The completions of Diagram (1) form a gerbe on OY \u2212Alg/OX\n\u0001\nbanded by DerOY (OX , J). The class in H 2 OY \u2212Alg/OX , DerOY (OX , J) of this\ngerbe obstructs the existence of a solution to this problem. If the obstruction\nvan\u0001\nishes, solutions form a torsor under H 1 OY \u2212Alg/OX , DerOY (OX , J) , and the\n\u0001\nautomorphisms group of any solution is H 0 OY \u2212Alg/OX , DerOY (OX , J) .\nIn the case where I = 0 and Y = Y \u2032 , an extension always exists, so this\nimplies\nCorollary. There is an equivalence of categories between the category of completions of the diagram\nX _ _ _// X \u2032\n}\n}\n}\n\u000f\u000f ~~}\nY,\nby a scheme X \u2032 that is a square-zero extension of X with ideal J and the category of torsors on OY \u2212Alg/OX under the sheaf of abelian groups DerOY (OX , J).\n\u0001\nIsomorphism classes are in bijection with H 1 OY \u2212Alg/OX , DerOY (OX , J) and\n\u0001\nautomorphisms of any object are in bijection with H 0 OY \u2212Alg/OX , DerOY (OX , J) .\nHow do these obstructions compare to those defined by Illusie? In Section 9,\nwe prove\nTheorem. The cotangent complex LX/Y [Il71, II.1.2.3] represents cohomology\nof the sheaves DerOY (OX , J) on the site OY \u2212Alg/OX , in the sense that\n\u0001\nExtp (LX/Y , J) = H p OY \u2212Alg/OX , DerOY (OX , J) .\nThis shows that our obstruction groups are the same as Illusie's. In [Wi11],\nwe show that the obstruction classes agree with Illusie's by the identification\nabove.\n3. Review of topologies, sites, and topoi\nIf X is an object of a category C, a sieve of X is a subfunctor of the functor\nof points of X. It is frequently preferable to view a sieve as a fibered subcategory\nover C of the category C/X of objects of C over X. We shall pass back and\nforth between these perspectives without comment. See [SGA4-1, I.4] for more\nabove sieves (French: cribles).\nThe sieve of X generated from a collection S of maps Y \u2192 X is (as a fibered\ncategory) the collection of all Z \u2192 X that factor through some Y \u2192 X in S.\n4\n\n\fA topology on a category C is a collection J(X) of sieves of X for each object\nX of C. These are generally called the covering sieves of the topology. The\ncollections are required to comply with the conditions T1 (change of base), T2\n(local character), and T3 (inclusion of the sieves generated by identity maps) of\n[SGA4-1, D\u00e9finition II.1.1]. We shall usually describe the sieves in each J(X)\nby giving generators. These generators are called covering families.\nEvery category possesses a canonical topology [SGA4-1, D\u00e9finition II.2.5],\nthe finest in which all representable functors are sheaves.\nIf C is a category with a topology, a family S of objects of C is called a\ncollection of topological generators of C if every object X of C is covered by a\nsieve generated by maps from objects of S to X [SGA4-1, D\u00e9finition II.3.0.1].\nWe shall depart from the definitions [SGA4-1, I.1.1.5] and [MLM94, III.2.1] and\ncall C, together with its topology, a site if C possesses a set of topological\ngenerators.\nIf C is a category with a topology, a functor F : C \u25e6 \u2192 Sets is called a sheaf\nif the natural map\nF (X) \u2192 Hom(R, F )\nis a bijection for every X in C and for every covering sieve R of X [SGA4-1,\nD\u00e9finition II.2.1]. Here, Hom(R, F ) refers to maps of presheaves. If C0 is the\nfull subcategory of C spanned by a collection of generators of C with its induced\ntopology, then the restriction map identifies the category of sheaves on C with\nthe category of sheaves on C0 . If C is a site then C is generated topologically\nby a small subcategory, which ensures that the sheaves on C form a category,\ne\nwhich is frequently denoted C.\nAny presheaf on a site C has an associated sheaf. If X is an object of C\nthen the associated sheaf of the functor represented by X is denoted \u01eb(X). This\ne\ndetermines a functor \u01eb : C \u2192 C.\nA site C is called a topos if its topology is the canonical one and the functor\ne described above is an equivalence. Once again, our definition is\n\u01eb : C \u2192 C\nslightly different from [SGA4-1, D\u00e9finition IV.1.1]; it is equivalent to [MLM94,\nDefinition III.4.3]. Every topos E has a final object, which we will denote by\nthe same letter E.\nA morphism of topoi f : C \u2192 C \u2032 is a pair of functors f \u2217 : C \u2032 \u2192 C and\nf\u2217 : C \u2192 C \u2032 such that f\u2217 is right adjoint to f \u2217 and f \u2217 is exact. Every topos\nadmits an essentially unique morphism to the topos Sets.\nWe shall depart again from [SGA4-1, IV.4.9.1] in the definition of a morphism of sites, and declare that a morphism between sites is a morphism between\ntheir associated topoi. This extrinsic definition can be made intrinsic (see e.g.\n[MLM94, Theorem VII.10.1]), but we will be content to recall here that a morphism of sites can be induced from a cocontinuous functor C \u2192 C \u2032 or from a\nleft exact continuous functor C \u2032 \u2192 C.\nA functor f : C \u2192 C \u2032 between sites is cocontinuous if, for any X \u2208 C and\nany covering sieve R of f (X), the collection of all Y \u2192 X such that f (Y ) \u2208 R\nis a covering sieve [SGA4-1, D\u00e9finition III.2.1, Proposition III.2.3]. A left exact\nfunctor g : C \u2032 \u2192 C is continuous if and only if it takes covering families to cover5\n\n\fing families [SGA4-1, D\u00e9finition III.1.1, Proposition III.1.3, Proposition III.1.6].\nIf f is left adjoint to g then cocontinuity of f coincides with continuity of g\n[SGA4-1, Proposition III.2.5].\nBy [Gr57, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 1.10.1], every topos has enough injective sheaves of\nabelian groups. This permits us to define the derived functors of f\u2217 (applied to\nsheaves of abelian groups) for any morphism of topoi f : C \u2192 C \u2032 . In the case\nwhere C \u2032 = Sets, these derived functors are denoted F 7\u2192 H p (C, F ).\nu\nv\nSuppose that A \u2212\n\u2192B\u2212\n\u2192 C is a sequence of morphisms of topoi. Since u\u2217 has\nan exact left adjoint it preserves injectives and we obtain a spectral sequence\nfor the composition of functors [Gr57, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 2.4.1]\n\u0001\nRp v\u2217 Rq u\u2217 F \u21d2 Rp+q (vu)\u2217 F\nfor any sheaf of abelian groups on A. In terms of derived categories, we have\nRv\u2217 \u25e6 Ru\u2217 = R(vu)\u2217 . In the case where C = Sets the spectral sequence above\nspecializes to\nH p (B, Rq u\u2217 F ) \u21d2 H p+q (A, F ).\nSee [SGA4-2, Expos\u00e9 V] for more about the Cartan\u2013Leray spectral sequences.\nIf X\u2022 is a hypercover of E [SGA4-2, V.7.3.1] then there is a spectral sequence\n[SGA4-2, V.7.4.0.3]\nH p (X\u2022 , Hq (F )) \u21d2 H p+q (E, F ).\nMore specifically, if I \u2022 is a resolution of F by sheaves that are acyclic for each\nof the Xp , then the double complex \u0393(X\u2022 , I \u2022 ) computes the cohomology of F .\nWe refer the reader to [SGA4-2, V.7] for more details.\n4. Review of torsors and gerbes\nWe restrict attention to torsors and gerbes under abelian groups. Suppose\nthat E is a topos and G is a sheaf of abelian groups on E. A G-torsor is a sheaf\nF on E with an action a : G \u00d7 F \u2192 F of G such that\n1. (pseudo-torsor) the map (a, p2 ) : G \u00d7 F \u2192 F \u00d7 F is an isomorphism of\nsheaves, and\n2. (local triviality) F covers E.\nIf F satisfies only the first condition then F is called a pseudo-torsor under G.\nThe second condition says that, locally in E, the sheaf F admits a section. Since\na section of a torsor trivializes it, the second condition says that F is locally\nisomorphic to G as a sheaf with G-action.\nTheorem (cf. [Gi71, Remarque III.3.5.4]). Isomorphism classes of torsors under an abelian group G are in bijection with H 1 (E, G). Isomorphisms between\nany two torsors form a pseudo-torsor under H 0 (E, G). In particular, automorphisms of a torsor are in canonical bijection with H 0 (E, G).\n\n6\n\n\fA gerbe on E banded by G is a stack F [Gi71, D\u00e9finition 1.2.1] on E with an\naction of G on the morphism sheaves of G that is compatible with composition\nand satisfies\n1. (pseudo-gerbe) for any two sections \u03be, \u03b7 of F over U , the sheaf Isom(\u03be, \u03b7)\nis a G-pseudo-torsor on U ,\n2. (local triviality for morphisms) any two sections of F over U are locallly\nisomorphic,\n3. (local triviality for objects) F covers E.\nIf F satisfies only the first condition, we call F a pseudo-gerbe banded by G.\nThe second condition ensures that Isom(\u03be, \u03b7) forms a GU -torsor for each pair of\nsections \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u0393(E/U, F ). As in the case of torsors, the final condition means\nthat sections of F exist locally in E. Since a section of F induces an equivalence\nof banded gerbes between F with BG, the classifying stack of G-torsors, we say\nthat a banded gerbe is locally isomorphic to BG.\nTheorem (cf. [Gi71, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me IV.3.4.2]). Equivalence classes of gerbes on\nE banded by an abelian group G are in bijection with H 2 (E, G). If F is a\ngerbe banded by G then sections of a F form a pseudo-torsor under H 1 (E, G).\nIsomorphisms between any two sections of F form a torsor under H 0 (E, G). In\nparticular, automorphisms of any section of F are in canonical bijection with\nH 0 (E, G).\n5. The topos of commutative rings\nAll rings and algebras are commutative and unital.\nNow let (E, A) be a ringed topos [SGA4-1, IV.11.1.1], and let B an A-algebra.\nLet A\u2212Alg(E)/B (or A\u2212Alg/B for short) be the category of pairs (U, C) where\nU \u2208 E and C is an AU -algebra with a map to BU . A morphism of A\u2212Alg/B\nfrom (U1 , C1 ) to (U2 , C2 ) is a map f : U1 \u2192 U2 of E and a map C1 \u2192 f \u2217 C2 of\nAU1 -algebras commuting with the projections to BU1 .\nDefinition. A family of maps (Ui , Ci ) \u2192 (U, C) in A\u2212Alg/B is covering if, for\nany V \u2192 U and any finite set of sections \u039b \u2282 \u0393(V, C), there exists, locally in\nV , a map V \u2192 Ui for some i and a lift of \u039b to \u0393(V, Ci ).\nTo understand this topology, it may be helpful to consider the case where\nE is a point. In that case, A \u2192 B is a ring homomorphism, and a family of\nA-algebra maps Ci \u2192 C over B is considered to be covering if every finite set\nof elements of C can be lifted to some Ci .\nNow let E be an arbitrary topos and suppose that R is a sieve of (U, C)\nin A\u2212Alg(E)/B. If V \u2192 U is a map of E and \u039b \u2282 \u0393(V, C) is finite, let\n(V, AV [\u039b]) \u2192 (U, C) be the induced map of A\u2212Alg/B. Let Q(\u039b) the collection\n\n7\n\n\fof all W \u2192 V such that it is possible to complete the diagram\n// (V, AV [\u039b])\n\n(W, AW [\u039b])\n\u001f\n\u001f\n\u001f\n\u000f\u000f\n\u2032\n(U , C \u2032 )\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// (U, C)\n\nwith (U \u2032 , C \u2032 ) in R. Then for R to be a covering sieve means that Q(\u039b) is a\ncovering sieve of V in E for every Q(\u039b) arising as above.\nIt is immediate from this description of the topology that any (U, C) in\nA\u2212Alg/B is covered by the collection of all (V, AV [S]) \u2192 (U, C) where S is\nan arbitrary finite set. Therefore the pairs (V, AV [S]) generate the topology of\nA\u2212Alg/B and we are free to say that in this topology, any A-algebra is locally a\nfinitely generated polynomial ring. Furthermore, we obtain a set of topological\ngenerators for A\u2212Alg/B by taking the collection of all (V, AV [S]) such that V\nlies in a set of topological generators for E.\nRemark. This topology is slightly more complicated than the ones used by\nGaitsgory, Quillen, and Rim. Analogues of those topologies would work here,\nbut this topology has a technical advantage in its possession of a set of topological generators. This permits us to make use of topoi without making recourse\nto universes.\n6. Deformation of homomorphisms\nLet A be a sheaf of rings on E and B \u2192 C a homomorphism of A-algebras.\nSuppose that C \u2032 is a square-zero extension of C, as an A-algebra, with ideal J.\nConsider the problem of lifting the homomorphism B \u2192 C to a map B \u2192 C \u2032\n(cf. [Il71, Probl\u00e8me III.2.2.1.1]).\nPutting B \u2032 = C \u2032 \u00d7C B, this problem immediately reduces to that of finding\n\u2032\na section of B \u2032 over B. We denote the set of such sections HomA\nB (B, B ).\nThe difference between any two sections of B \u2032 over B is an A-derivation from\nB into J. Denoting the set of all such derivations by DerA (B, J) we may say\n\u2032\nthat HomA\nB (B, B ) is a DerA (B, J)-pseudo-torsor. If B is allowed to vary we\nobtain a sheaf DerA (B, J) on A\u2212Alg/B, represented by the object (E, B + J),\nwhere B + J is the trivial square-zero extension of B by J. Then B \u2032 represents\na DerA (B, J)-pseudo-torsor on A\u2212Alg/B.\nIn fact, B \u2032 is a DerA (B, J)-torsor on A\u2212Alg/B, since the map (E, B \u2032 ) \u2192\n(E, B) is covering in A\u2212Alg/B. The cohomological classification of torsors now\nimplies\n\u0001\nTheorem 1. Let \u03c9 \u2208 H 1 A\u2212Alg/B, DerA (B, J) be the class of B \u2032 as a torsor\nunder DerA (B, J). Then \u03c9 = 0 if and only if B \u2032 admits a section as an A-algebra\nover B. In that case, the sections form a torsor under\n\u0001\nH 0 A\u2212Alg/B, DerA (B, J) = DerA (B, J).\n\n8\n\n\f7. Extensions of algebras\nSuppose that B is an A-algebra in the topos E and J is a B-module. Let\nExalA (B, J) be the category of square-zero A-algebra extensions of B with\nideal J. These categories fit together into a fibered category ExalA (B, J) over\nA\u2212Alg/B. We saw in Theorem 1 that any B \u2032 \u2208 ExalA (B, J) represents a\nDerA (B, J)-torsor on A\u2212Alg/B, so we obtain a fully faithful functor\nExalA (B, J) \u2192 BDerA (B, J)\n\n(2)\n\nfrom ExalA (B, J) to the classifying stack of DerA (B, J)-torsors on A\u2212Alg/B.\nLemma. Every DerA (B, J)-torsor is representable by a square-zero A-algebra\nextension of B by J.\nSuppose that P is a DerA (B, J)-torsor. Let B \u2032 be the sheaf on E whose\nsections over U are pairs (b, b\u2032 ) where b is a section of B over U , corresponding\nto a map b : AU [x] \u2192 B (denoted by the same letter), and b\u2032 is a section of b\u2217 P\nover (U, AU [x]).\nWe can give B \u2032 a ring structure as follows. Suppose (b, b\u2032 ) and (c, c\u2032 ) are two\nsections of B \u2032 . Choose a cover R of (E, B) over which P is trivial. Then E can\nbe covered by objects U such that there is a (U, C) \u2208 R and both bU and cU lift\nto \u0393(U, C). There is therefore a map\n(bU , cU ) : AU [x, y] \u2192 C\n\u2217\n\nand (bU , cU ) PC is trivial because PC is trivial. A trivial DerA (B, J)-torsor\n\u2032\nis certainly representable (by B + J), so let BC\nbe an extension of C by J\n\u2217\n\u2032\nrepresenting (bU , cU ) PC . We are given maps b\u2032U : AU [x] \u2192 BC\nand c\u2032U :\n\u2032\n\u2032\nAU [y] \u2192 BC over C. Since BU is a ring, these extend uniquely to a map\n\u2032\n(b\u2032U , c\u2032U ) : AU [x, y] \u2192 BC\nover C. Restricting this, via the maps AU [x] \u223c\n=\nAU [x + y] \u2192 AU [x, y] and AU [x] \u223c\n= AU [xy] \u2192 AU [x, y], yields sections that we\nwill denote b\u2032U + c\u2032U and b\u2032U c\u2032U of (b + c)\u2217 PC and (bc)\u2217 PC , respectively. These\ngive us sections (bU + cU , b\u2032U + c\u2032U ) and (bU cU , b\u2032U c\u2032U ) of B \u2032 over U .\nThe uniqueness of the constructions above implies that they patch together\nto give a ring structure on B \u2032 over E, which makes (E, B \u2032 ) an object of A\u2212Alg/B.\nThe verifications of commutativity, associativity, etc. are essentially the same,\nusing a trio of sections of C instead of a pair. To check that B \u2032 represents P , one\nonly needs to produce an isomorphism between P and the object represented by\nB \u2032 under the assumption that P admits a section and B is a finitely generated\npolynomial algebra over A, since the pairs (U, AU [S]) such that PU is trivial and\nS is finite generate the topology of A\u2212Alg/B. Under these assumptions, the\nconstruction clearly provides the isomorphism, and this varies in a functorial\nway with free A-algebras B.\nRemark. Let F be the fibered category of pairs (U, B \u2192 C) where B \u2192 C is\nan A-algebra morphism over U and morphisms are commutative squares. The\nprojection F \u2192 A\u2212Alg sending the object above to (U, C) makes F into a\nfibered category over A\u2212Alg and the proof of the lemma demonstrates that F\nis a stack over A\u2212Alg.\n9\n\n\fThe cohomological classification of torsors now gives us\nTheorem 2. The functor (2) is an equivalence. Isomorphism classes in the\ncategory ExalA (B, J) are therefore in bijection with H 1 (A\u2212Alg/B, DerA (B, J)).\n8. Deformation of algebras\nLet A be a sheaf of rings on E and B an A-algebra. Suppose that A\u2032 is an\nextension of A with ideal I (not necessarily square-zero). Fix a B-module J and\nan A \u2192 B homomorphism \u03c6 : I \u2192 J. Define Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6) to be the category\nof completions of the diagram\n// A\n// A\u2032\n\u001f\n\u001f\n\u001f\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\u000f\n// J _ _ _// B \u2032 _ _ _// B\n// I\n\n0\n\n0\n\n// 0\n\n// 0\n\nby an extension B \u2032 of B by J (cf. [Il71, Probl\u00e8me 2.1.2.1]). Allowing B to\nvary, these categories fit together into a fibered category Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6) over\nA\u2212Alg/B. (Note that the special case I = 0 recovers ExalA (B, J) = Def A (A, B, 0).)\nIf B \u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 are any objects in Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6) then the difference between\nany two isomorphisms between B \u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 is a derivation B \u2192 J, i.e., an element\nof DerA (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6). It follows from the lemma of Section 7 that DerA (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6)\nis a stack, so this tells us that Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6) is a pseudo-gerbe banded by\nDerA (B, J), and Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6) is a pseudo-gerbe over A\u2212Alg/B, banded by\nDerA (B, J). In fact, we have\nProposition. Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6) is a gerbe over A\u2212Alg/B, banded by DerA (B, J).\nWe must check that Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6) admits a section locally in A\u2212Alg/B, and\nthat any two sections are locally isomorphic. Since B is locally a polynomial\nalgebra over A, it's sufficient for the local existence to show that Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6)\nin that case. But then we could take B \u2032 = A\u2032 [S] \u2210I[S] J, the extension obtained\nby pushing out the extension A\u2032 [S] of A[S] by I[S] by the canonical map I[S] \u2192\nJ.\nTo prove that any two sections B \u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 of Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6) are locally\nisomorphic, we shall construct their difference B \u2032\u2032\u2032 = B \u2032\u2032 \u2212 B \u2032 and show that it\nis a trivial extension of B as an algebra over A\u2032 \u2212 A\u2032 = A + I. Before making\nthis precise, note that we may replace A\u2032 by A\u2032 /I 2 , and therefore assume that\nI 2 = 0, without changing the deformation problem. The ring B \u2032\u2032 \u00d7B B \u2032 is an\nextension of B by the ideal J \u00d7 J and there is a morphism of exact sequences,\n0\n\n// I \u00d7 I\n\n// A\u2032 \u00d7A A\u2032\n\n// A\n\n// 0\n\n0\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// J \u00d7 J\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// B \u2032 \u00d7B B \u2032\u2032\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// B\n\n// 0.\n\n10\n\n\fWe push out these sequences via the difference maps I \u00d7 I \u2192 I and J \u00d7 J \u2192 J\nsending (x, y) to x \u2212 y. This yields a map of exact sequences\n0\n\n// I\n\n// A + I\n\n// A\n\n// 0\n\n0\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// J\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// B \u2032\u2032\u2032\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// B\n\n// 0.\n\nNote that B \u2032\u2032 can be recovered functorially from B \u2032 and B \u2032\u2032\u2032 by an addition\nprocedure inverse to the difference procedure just executed. Thus to show that\nB \u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 are locally isomorphic, as extensions of B compatible with A\u2032 , it is\nequivalent to show that B \u2032\u2032\u2032 is locally isomorphic to the trivial extension B + J\nof B, with its trivial (A + I)-algebra structure.\nThe (A+I)-algebra structure of B \u2032\u2032\u2032 is determined by the A-algebra structure\ninduced from the section A \u2192 A + I. It is therefore equivalent to show that any\nextension of B by J as an A-algebra is locally isomorphic to B + J. This was\nthe content of Theorem 1.\nThe cohomological classification of banded gerbes now provides\n\u0001\nTheorem 3. Let \u03c9 be the class in H 2 A\u2212Alg/B, DerA (B, J) corresponding\nto the banded gerbe Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6). Then \u03c9 = 0 if and only if Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6) is\nnon-empty.\nIn that case, Def A (A\u2032 , B, \u03c6) is isomorphic as a banded gerbe to the classifying\n\u2032\nstack of DerA (B, J)-torsors. Hence, isomorphism classes\n\u0001 in Def A (A , B, \u03c6) form\n1\na torsor under the group H A\u2212Alg/B, DerA (B, J) , and the automorphism\ngroup of any fixed object of Def A (B, J) is\n\u0001 canonically isomorphic to the group\nDerA (B, J) = H 0 A\u2212Alg/B, DerA (B, J) .\n9. The cohomology of free algebras\nSuppose that E is a topos, A a sheaf of algebras on E, and S a sheaf of sets\non E. Let J be a sheaf of A[S]-modules. We wish to compare the cohomology\ngroups of DerA (A[S], J) on A\u2212Alg/A[S] and JS on E/S. We construct several\nsites to mediate between the A\u2212Alg/A[S] and E/S.\nLet Sets(E) and Sets\u2217 (E), or Sets and Sets\u2217 for short, be the sites whose\ncommon underlying category is the category of pairs (U, T ) where U is an object\nof E and T is a sheaf of sets on U . A map (U1 , T1 ) \u2192 (U2 , T2 ) is a map\nf : U1 \u2192 U2 and a map T1 \u2192 f \u2217 T2 . (From another point of view, this category\nis the category of arrows in E.)\nWe shall say that a family of morphisms (Ui , Ti ) \u2192 (U, T ) is covering in\nSets\u2217 if, for any f : V \u2192 U and any finite subset \u039b \u2282 \u0393(V, f \u2217 T ), there is,\nlocally in V , a factorization of f through g : V \u2192 Ui , for some i, and a lift of\n\u039b to \u0393(V, g \u2217 Ti ). The topology on Sets is defined in the same way, except \u039b is\nrestricted to be a 1-element set.\nRemark. The topologies on Sets and Sets\u2217 are genuinely different. In the case\nwhere E is the punctual topos (i.e., the category of sets), the category of sheaves\n11\n\n\fon Sets(E) may be identified with the category of sets; the category of sheaves\non Sets\u2217 (E) may be identified with the category of presheaves on the category\nof finite sets.\nThe topology on Sets is finer than that on Sets\u2217 , so there is a morphism of\nsites Sets \u2192 Sets\u2217 (the identity functor is cocontinuous). This induces a map\n\u03a6 : Sets/(E, S) \u2192 Sets\u2217 /(E, S), for any sheaf of sets S on E.\nThere is also a functor Sets\u2217 /(E, S) \u2192 A\u2212Alg/A[S] which sends (U, T ) to\n(U, AU [T ]). This functor is left exact, and by definition, it takes covers to covers\nso it is continuous by [SGA4-1, Proposition III.1.6] and we get a morphism of\nsites \u03a8 : A\u2212Alg/A[S] \u2192 Sets\u2217 /(E, S).\nFinally, we have a cocontinuous functor Sets(E) \u2192 E sending (U, T ) to i! T ,\nwhere i is the canonical morphism of topoi from E/U to E [SGA4-1, IV.5.1\u20132].\nThis induces a morphism of sites \u039e : Sets/(E, S) \u2192 E/S. Putting all of these\nmorphisms together, we obtain the following diagram of morphisms of sites.\nA\u2212Alg/A[S]\nSets/(E, S)\nOOO\ns\noo\ns\nO\no\ns\nO\n\u03a8ooo\n\u039e ss\nOO\u03a6O\no\ns\nO\ns\nOOO\noo\nwwooo\n''\nyysss\n\u2217\nE/S\nSets /(E, S)\nProposition. The morphisms \u03a6 and \u03a8 are acyclic.\nFirst consider \u03a8 : A\u2212Alg/A[S] \u2192 Sets\u2217 /(E, S). To see that Rp \u03a8\u2217 F = 0 for\np > 0 is a local problem in Sets\u2217 /(E, S). We can therefore reduce to the case\nwhere S is the constant sheaf associated to some finite set S0 , since pairs (V, T )\nwhere T is constant and finite generate the topology of Sets\u2217 /E. We must show\nthat if \u03b1 \u2208 H p (A\u2212Alg/A[S], \u03a8\u2217 (U, T )) then \u03b1 can be trivialized on some cover\nof (U, T ). But \u03a8\u2217 (U, T ) = (U, AU [T ]) and all covering sieves of (U, AU [T ]) in\nA\u2212Alg/A[S] are pulled back from covering sieves of the final object of E, hence\nare pulled back from covering sieves of (E, S) in Sets\u2217 /(E, S). Since \u03b1 can\ncertainly be trivialized on some covering sieve of (U, AU [T ]), any covering sieve\nof Sets\u2217 /(E, S) that pulls back via \u03a8 to this one will trivialize \u03b1 in Sets\u2217 /(E, S).\nNow consider \u03a6 : Sets/(E, S) \u2192 Sets\u2217 /(E, S). If R is a covering sieve of some\nobject (U, T ) of Sets/(E, S), then let R\u2032 be the collection of all finite disjoint\nunions of objects of R. If R is a covering sieve of Sets/(E, S) which trivializes\na cohomology class, then R\u2032 is a covering sieve of Sets\u2217 /(E, S) which trivializes\nthe same cohomology class. Therefore this map is acyclic as well.\nLemma. There is a canonical isomorphism \u03a6\u2217 (E, J) \u2243 \u03a8\u2217 DerA (A[S], J) for\nany sheaf of A[S]-modules J.\nThis is a matter of unwinding the definitions. For (U, T ) \u2208 Sets\u2217 /(E, S), we\nhave\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0393 (U, T ), \u03a6\u2217 (E, J) = \u0393 (U, T ), (E, J) = HomU (T, JU ).\n\n12\n\n\fOn the other hand,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0393 (U, T ), \u03a8\u2217 DerA (A[S], J) = \u0393 (U, A[T ]), DerA (A[S], J)\n= DerAU (AU [T ], JU ) = HomU (T, JU )\nusing the universal property of A[T ].\nSince \u03a6 and \u03a8 are acyclic, this proves that R\u03a6\u2217 (E, J) = R\u03a8\u2217 DerA (A[S], J).\nWe can therefore compute the cohomology of DerA (A[S], J) by computing the\ncohomology of (E, J) on Sets/(E, S).\nLemma. The natural map J \u2192 R\u039e\u2217 \u039e\u2217 J is an isomorphism.\nThe projection Sets/(E, S) \u2192 E/S sending (U, T ) to T is left exact and\ninduces an exact left adjoint \u039e! to \u039e\u2217 [SGA4-1, Proposition I.5.4 4]. Therefore,\n\u039e\u2217 preserves injectives. Since \u039e\u2217 is also exact, this implies R\u039e\u2217 \u039e\u2217 J = \u039e\u2217 \u039e\u2217 J.\n\u2217\nThe natural map J \u2192 \u039e\u2217 \u039e\u2217 J\n\u0001 is certainly an isomorphism, since \u039e J = (E, J)\nand Hom(E,S) (E, T ), (E, J) = HomS (T, J).\nLet u : E/S \u2192 E and v : A\u2212Alg/A[S] \u2192 E denote the projections. Then\nthe lemma implies that Rv\u2217 DerA (A[S], J) = Ru\u2217 J.\nLemma. There is a canonical isomorphism RHom(ZS , J) \u2243 Ru\u2217 u\u2217 J for any\nsheaf of abelian groups J on E.\nSince u\u2217 has an exact left adjoint on sheaves of abelian groups [SGA4-1,\nProposition IV.11.3.1], both RHom(ZS , J) and Ru\u2217 u\u2217 J can be computed by\ntaking an injective resolution of J in E. It's therefore sufficient to remark that\nHom(ZS , J) = Hom(S, J), by definition.\nPutting all of the lemmas together, we find that\nRv\u2217 DerA (A[S], J) = RHomZ (ZS , J) = RHomA[S] (A[S]S , J) = RHom(\u03a9A[S]/A , J).\nCorollary. If J is injective and B is a free A-algebra then for every p > 0, the\ngroup H p (A\u2212Alg/B, DerA (B, J)) vanishes.\nSince \u03a9B/A is functorial in B, this permits us to compute the cohomology\nof DerA (B, J) for any sheaf B of A-algebras and any B-module J using hyper\u010cech cohomology. Let B\u2022 be the standard simplicial resolution of B by free\nA-algebras [Il71, I.1.5.5 b, II.1.2.1.1]. By [Il71, I.1.5.3], the resolution B\u2022 \u2192 B\nis a homotopy equivalence on the underlying sheaves of sets. This implies in\nparticular that it is a hypercover, so corollary above implies that Rv\u2217 DerA (B, J)\nis computed by the complex C with\nC p,q = v\u2217 DerA (Bp , J q )\nfor any injective resolution J \u2022 of J. Taking B\u2022 = PA (B) we obtain the cotangent\ncomplex as LB/A = \u03a9B\u2022 /A \u2297B\u2022 B by [Il71, II.1.2.3], and then\nRv\u2217 DerA (B, J) \u2243 v\u2217 DerA (B\u2022 , J \u2022 ) = HomB\u2022 (\u03a9B\u2022 /A , J \u2022 )\n= HomB (\u03a9B\u2022 /A \u2297 B, J \u2022 ) \u2243 RHom(LB/A , J).\nB\u2022\n\n13\n\n\fThis proves that the cotangent complex represents the functor sending J to\nthe cohomology of DerA (B, J):\nTheorem 4. Let v denote the projection A\u2212Alg(E)/B \u2192 E. If J is any\nB-module, then there is an isomorphism in the derived category of sheaves of\nB-modules\nRv\u2217 DerA (B, J) \u2243 RHom(LB/A , J).\nIn particular,\n\u0001\nExtp (LB/A , J) = H p A\u2212Alg(E)/B, DerA (B, J)\nfor all p.\n10. Acknowledgements\nI am happy to thank Dan Abramovich, Patrick Brosnan, Barbara Fantechi,\nMartin Olsson, Ravi Vakil, and Angelo Vistoli for helpful conversations about\nthese topics. Although a goal of this work has been to circumvent some of\nthe technical aspects of [Il71], Illusie's treatise has been a continual inspiration.\nVistoli's remark that \"with uncanny regularity [deformations are] a cohomology\ngroup of a certain algebraic object, and [obstructions are] the cohomology group\nof the same object in one degree higher\" [Vi97, p. 2] was a particular impetus\nfor this project. Dan Abramovich provided numerous suggestions that improved\nthe exposition of this paper considerably (and helped me to avoid one serious\nerror). I am also grateful to Bhargav Bhatt for informing me of Gaitsgory's\nwork.\nThis research was partly supported by nsf-msprf 0802951.\nReferences\n[Ga95] Dennis Gaitsgory.
