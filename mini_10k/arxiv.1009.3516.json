The development of\nmethods for including individual covariates has focused on models that condition on the\nfirst capture of each individual. A consequence is that likelihood based inference is restricted to statements about survival or recapture probabilities and related quantities.\nImportantly, these models do not include abundance parameters (or parameters related\nto abundance, such as population growth rates or stopover time) in the likelihood. Instead, inference about abundance has relied on ad-hoc Horvitz-Thompson-type approaches\n(Huggins 1989, McDonald and Amstrup 2001).\nIndividual-specific time-varying covariates pose problems in models based on the full\nlikelihood as the covariate values cannot be observed for individuals that were available\nfor capture but were not caught. In order to fit these models by maximum likelihood,\nwe would need to integrate out the missing covariate values for the unseen individuals\nfor each possible value of abundance, as well as integrating out the missing values for the\nindividuals we observed. Explicit integration of the likelihood leads to the observed data\nlikelihood (ODL), but this integration is often difficult to do in practice. An alternative\napproach is to model in terms of the complete data likelihood (CDL), where specialized\ncomputational algorithms, such as the Gibbs sampler or the EM algorithm perform the required integration during the model fitting process. Schofield (2007), Schofield and Barker\n(2008, 2009) lay out a unified framework for capture-recapture modeling using the CDL,\n\n2\n\n\fwhich while flexible enough to include individual-specific time-varying covariates, still requires the user to construct these algorithms in order to fit the model. The same process\nis required when including individual covariates in closed population studies, for example,\nsee King and Brooks (2008), Royle (2009).\nTo date, no user-friendly software is available for full open population modeling in\nthe presence of individual-specific time-varying continuous covariates.\n\nAlgorithms do\n\nexist for other individual-specific open population models, including user-written algorithms for the multi-state model (Dupuis and Schwarz 2007) and models where survival\nand fecundity parameters depend on population abundance (Schofield and Barker 2008).\nUnfortunately, these algorithms require custom-written software and lack generalizability. Another approach is to include these models in JAGS (Plummer 2003) or BUGS\n(Lunn et al. 2000), software that fits models using the Gibbs sampler and is being increasingly used by ecologists Royle et al. (2007), Gimenez et al. (2009), Schofield et al. (2009),\nLink and Barker (2010). This has been done for individual-specific mixed effects models\nin Royle and Dorazio (2008), Link and Barker (2010).\nHere we consider models for two datasets, both of which have individual-specific timevarying covariates. The first is an example from Nichols et al. (1992), where the robust\ndesign is used to sample meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, with the body mass\nmeasured every time there was a capture. The body mass measurements were discretized\nin order to fit a multi-state model, conditional on first capture, to understand how the\ncovariate body mass changed through time. This was later refined by Bonner and Schwarz\n(2006) who model body mass as an individual-specific time-varying covariate, although,\ntheir analysis ignored the robust design and conditioned on first capture. Other analyses\nhave used the robust design to estimate abundance, but did this without taking into account\nbody mass (Williams et al. 2002, Pg. 525). Here we use information on the body mass\nwithin the robust design to estimate abundance.\n3\n\n\fThe second dataset is a study of conjunctivitis in house finch, Carpodacus mexicanus,\nwhere the covariate of interest is disease status, a covariate that is not always observed.\nConn and Cooch (2009) model the data using an extension to the multi-state model to\naccount for the partially observed data, however, they only model conditional on first\ncapture. Even though they are able to obtain estimates of survival for each disease class\nand movement between the two disease classes, they were unable to get an predictions of\nthe population in each disease class through time.\nHere we show how the framework of Schofield (2007), Schofield and Barker (2008, 2009)\ncan be used to extend the models of Royle et al. (2007), Royle and Dorazio (2008) and\nLink and Barker (2010) to fit full open population models with individual-specific timevarying covariates in BUGS. There are only minor differences in the model and BUGS code\nfor the two examples, despite the differences between the datasets: (i) continuous vs. categorical covariate, (ii) robust design vs. standard capture-recapture design, (iii) covariate\nmeasurement every capture occasion vs. uncertainty in covariate measurements on some\ncapture occasions. This shows the power and flexibility of the modeling approach, since\nthe two examples include as special cases: the multi-state model, multi-event type models,\nindividual-specific time-varying continuous covariates, and lifetime duration models such\nas the stop-over model.\n\n2\n\nModel Framework\n\nCapture-recapture models involve complex missing data mechanisms.\n\nTraditional ap-\n\nproaches to inference focus on deriving the likelihood for the observed data (the ODL)\nby integrating over all missing data. Instead, we use the modeling framework of Schofield\n(2007), Schofield and Barker (2008, 2009) that uses data augmentation (Tanner and Wong\n1987) to allow us to model in terms of the complete data likelihood (CDL). Similar ideas\n\n4\n\n\fhave also been proposed by Royle and Dorazio (2008).\nThe likelihood we use for inference is in terms of the complete data, which for a capturerecapture study with individual-specific time-varying covariate data are the (i) times of\nbirth, (ii) times of death, and (iii) complete covariate values for each individual ever available for capture. The main advantage of using this likelihood over the ODL is that we\nare able to focus on modeling the processes of interest rather than having to account for\nthe complexities caused by missing data that result from sampling methods. Importantly,\nin adopting the CDL approach to inference, we do not need to make any additional assumptions to those made when using the ODL. It is simply a reformulation of the model\nin terms of the easier-to-understand CDL where we use computational algorithms, such as\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, to\nintegrate over all missing data.\nWe write the CDL for the capture-recapture model including birth and covariates as\n\n[ab |\u03b8b , N] [ad |ab , \u03b8d , N] [X|ab , ad , \u03b8X , N] [z|\u03b8z , N],\n{z\n}|\n{z\n} | {z }\n| {z } |\nBirth\n\nCapture\n\nMortality\n\n(1)\n\nCovariate\n\nwhere [Y |X] is the probability (density) of the random variable Y given X;\nabij = 0 means that individual i has yet to be born at, or before, sampling period j, with\nabij = 1 otherwise;\nadij = 1 means that individual i has yet to die at sampling period j, with adij = 0 otherwise;\nXij = 1 means that individual i was caught in sampling period j, with Xij = 0 otherwise;\nzij is the covariate value for individual i in sampling period j;\n\u03b8b are parameters describing the birth process, \u03b8d are parameters describing the mortality\nprocess, \u03b8X are parameters describing the capture process, \u03b8z are parameters of the covariate distribution and N is the total number of individuals available for capture during the\n5\n\n\fstudy period (which is distinct from Nj , the number of individuals alive in the jth sampling occasion). The covariate z can be used to help model the birth, death and covariate\nprocesses, although we assume that this is specified through the models for \u03b8b , \u03b8d and \u03b8X .\nIn order for inference to be valid, we must ensure that these models do not violate the laws\nof conditional probability, for example, by assuming that survival probability depends on\nthe covariate value at the end of the period.\nMost demographic summaries of interest are obtained as derived quantities of ad and\nab . For example, the population size in each sampling period, Nj , and the \"lifetime\" for\neach individual \u2206i are\n\nNj =\n\u2206i =\n\nN\nX\n\ni=1\nk\nX\n\nabij adij , j = 1, . . . , k,\nabij adij , i = 1, . . . , N.\n\nj=1\n\nOther potential quantities of interest we could specify include the number of births and\ndeaths between each sampling period.\nThe choice of model for each of the components in (1) will depend on the data, and the\nassumptions we are willing to make. For a standard capture-recapture study design, we\npresent some common models for each component. We leave the parameters for mortality\nand capture to be individual specific as these are being modeled in terms of individualspecific covariates.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Birth Component\n\nOne possible model for the birth components is\nN\nk\nY\nY\nb\nb\n[a |\u03b8 , N] =\n[ai1 |\u03b8 ] [abij |abi1 , . . . , abij\u22121 , \u03b8b ]\nb\n\nb\n\ni=1\n\nj=2\n\n6\n\n\f=\n\nN\nY\ni=1\n\nBern(\u03b61 )\n\nk\nY\n\nj\u22121\nY\n\nBern\n\nj=2\n\n(1 \u2212 abih )\u03b6j +\n\n1\u2212\n\nj\u22121\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 abih )\n\nh=1\n\nh=1\n\n!!\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Bern(p) denotes a Bernoulli distribution with parameter p and we set \u03b6k = 1. We\ninclude the term\n\nQj\u22121\n\nb\nh=1 (1 \u2212 aih )\u03b6j + 1 \u2212\n\nQj\u22121\n\nh=1 (1\n\n\u2212 abih ) to ensure that an individual can\n\nonly be born once. The value \u03b61 is the probability of being born before the study began,\nwith the values \u03b6j+1 defined as the probability of being born between sample j and j + 1\nconditional on (i) not being born before j, and (ii) being at risk of capture at some point\nduring the study. A possible reparameterization is\n\n\u03b20 = \u03b61 , \u03b2j = \u03b6j+1 1 \u2212\n\nj\u22121\nX\nh=1\n\n\u03b2h\n\n!\n\n, j = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1.\n\nThis gives the birth formulation of Schwarz and Arnason (1996) where \u03b2j is the probability\nof being born between sample j and j + 1 conditional on being at risk of capture at some\npoint during the study. Neither \u03b6j nor \u03b2j are meaningful birth parameters, since they are\ndefined in terms of the study/sampling process, as for example, a change in k changes the\nparameter values. A more natural parameterization is to use per-capita birth rates,\n\n\u03b7j =\n\n\u03b2j N\n, j = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1.\nNj\n\nThis gives the birth formulation used in Schofield and Barker (2008), where \u03b7j is the expected number of births between sampling period j and j + 1 for each individual in the\npopulation at sampling period j conditional on N. These parameters are similar to the\nbirth parameters, fj , used by Pradel (1996), Link and Barker (2005); the difference is that\nthe denominator they use is E[Nj |N] instead of Nj .\n\n7\n\n\f2.2\n\nThe Mortality Component\n\nWe factor the component for mortality as,\nk\nN Y\nY\n[adij |adij\u22121, abij\u22121 , \u03b8d ]\n[a |a , \u03b8 , N] =\nd\n\nb\n\nd\n\ni=1 j=2\n\n=\n\nk\nN Y\nY\n\nBern(adij\u22121 (abij\u22121 Sij\u22121 + (1 \u2212 abij\u22121 ))),\n\n(3)\n\ni=1 j=2\n\nwhere the parameter Sij is the probability of individual i surviving between sampling period\nj and j + 1. The term adij\u22121 (abij\u22121 Sij + (1 \u2212 abij\u22121 )) is required to ensure that an individual\ncan only (i) die after being born, and (ii) live once.\n\n2.3\n\nThe Capture Component\n\nWe factor the component for capture as,\n\nb\n\nd\n\nX\n\n[X|a , a , \u03b8 , N] =\n\nN Y\nk\nY\n\n[Xij |abij , adij , \u03b8X ]\n\ni=1 j=1\n\n=\n\nN Y\nk\nY\n\nBern(adij abij pij ),\n\n(4)\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nwhere pij is the probability of capture for individual i in sampling period j. The term\nadij abij is required to ensure that an individual is only available for capture while it is alive.\n\n2.4\n\nAdditions Required For BUGS/JAGS\n\nIn order to make inference about the parameters in the model, we adopt a Bayesian approach and fit all examples using the software JAGS (Plummer 2003), with model, data,\ninitial values and script files available at www.maths.otago.ac.nz/~ rbarker/BUGS. We\nuse JAGS for the following examples due to superior convergence in trial runs of the algorithms as compared to OpenBUGS. The modeling language of JAGS is nearly identical\n8\n\n\fto BUGS (Lunn et al. 2000) and is able to be called from R (Su and Yajima 2009). We\ndescribe the main differences between BUGS and JAGS and how to specify the data and\nthe initial values in the supplementary materials.\nNeither JAGS nor BUGS allow stochastic indices, such as N, as was used in Schofield and Barker\n(2008). Instead, we must use a computational trick to include N. The trick is given in\nDurban and Elston (2005) and involves specifying M, an upper bound for N. An alternate, yet mathematically equivalent approach is given in Royle et al. (2007). They also\nspecify M but then reparameterize the model in terms of an incomplete indicator variable,\nw, instead of N. The value wi = 1 means that individual i was at risk of capture during\nthe study and wi = 0 otherwise, with\n\nPM\n\ni=1\n\nwi = N. Having used both approaches, we find\n\nthem practically equivalent with the exception that the specification of Royle et al. (2007)\nno longer has N available for hierarchical modeling, but does generally run slightly faster\nthan the approach of Durban and Elston (2005). Since we have no desire to include a hierarchical model for N in the examples we explore, we use the approach of Royle et al. (2007)\nto make use of the faster algorithm. For readability, we do not change the CDL in (1) to\nreflect this additional likelihood component and continue to write the CDL conditioning\non N.\nAnother difficulty is that attempting to use the per-capita birth rate (\u03b7j ) parameterization in JAGS or BUGS results in code that is currently impractically slow to run. Here\nwe use the less natural \u03b6j parameterization described above. This is not a limitation of\nMCMC or the Gibbs sampler, as Schofield and Barker (2008) used the per-capita birth\nrates. Instead it is a current limitation of JAGS and BUGS.\n\n3\n\nExample: Meadow Voles\n\nNichols et al. (1992) report a capture-recapture study of meadow voles, Microtus pennsyl-\n\n9\n\n\fvanicus, using a robust design (Pollock 1982) with 173 individuals caught over 6 primary\nperiods each with 5 secondary samples. Every time an individual was caught the mass of\nthe animal was recorded to the nearest integer. The scales used to measure mass had a\nmaximum at 60 grams, with many individuals censored.\nBonner and Schwarz (2006) collapsed the data across the secondary periods, and allocated a single measurement to the observed body mass. Using these data they extended\nthe Cormack-Jolly-Seber model (CJS) to include an individual-specific time-varying continuous covariate. Schofield et al. (2009) used the same data to show how to fit this model\nusing BUGS (neither Bonner and Schwarz (2006) nor Schofield et al. (2009) accounted for\nthe censored data). Here we extend this model to include the full robust design and make\nuse of all information on body mass. Including the birth process in the model allows us to\nestimate the population size of the meadow vole in the presence of the individual-specific\ntime-varying continuous covariate.\nThe CDL is given in (1), with the birth component given in (2) and the mortality\ncomponent given in (3). To include the robust design, we redefine X to be an array with\nXijl = 1 if individual i is caught in primary period j and secondary period l. We extend\nthe capture component in (4) to include both the k1 primary periods and the k2j secondary\nperiods,\n\nb\n\nd\n\nX\n\n[X|a , a , \u03b8 , N] =\n\nk2j\nk1 Y\nN Y\nY\n\n[Xijl |abij , adij , \u03b8X ]\n\ni=1 j=1 l=1\n\n=\n\nk2j\nk1 Y\nN Y\nY\n\nBern(adij abij pijl ),\n\ni=1 j=1 l=1\n\nWe also redefine z to be an array with zijl being the body mass for individual i in\nprimary period j and secondary period l. Since every observed body mass value was either\ncensored or rounded we treat zijl as missing for every individual in every sampling period\n\n10\n\n\fobs\nand denote the observed masses by zijl\n. We specify the model for z as\n\nk2j\nN Y\nk1 Y\nY\n[z|\u03b8 , N] =\n[zijl |\u03b8z ]\nz\n\ni=1 j=bi l=1\n\n=\n\nk2j\nk1 Y\nN Y\nY\n\nN(\u03bbij , \u03c3z2 )I(\u03b41ijl , \u03b42ijl ),\n\ni=1 j=fi l=1\n\nwhere N(\u03bc, \u03c3 2 ) denotes a Normal distribution with mean \u03bc and variance \u03c3 2 , bi is the\nfirst sample individual i was alive and I() is used to include the rounding, censoring and\ntruncation, with\n\n\u03b41ijl =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nobs\n\uf8f2 zijl\n\u2212 0.5 if Xijl = 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 0\n\n, \u03b42ijl =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nobs\nobs\n\uf8f2 zijl\n+ 0.5 if Xijl = 1 and zijl\n6= 60\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u221e\n\notherwise\n\notherwise.\n\nIn other words, we assume that during the secondary periods when the population is\nassumed to be closed, mass remains constant and any differences are attributable to the\nmeasurement error \u03c3z2 . We follow Bonner and Schwarz (2006) and model \u03bbij as\n\n2\n2\n\u03bbibi \u223c N(\u03bc\u03bb , \u03c3\u03bb1\n), \u03bbij \u223c N(\u03bbij\u22121 + \u2206j\u22121 , \u03c3\u03bb2\n), j = bi + 1, . . . , k1 .\n\nThis is a random walk with drift, where the mass of each individual increases, on average,\n\u2206j grams between primary period j and j + 1.\nWe model parameters S and p as\n\nlogit(Sij ) = \u03b10 + \u03b11 \u03bb\u2032ij + \u03b7jS , \u03b7jS \u223c N(0, \u03c3S2 ),\n2\n2\nlogit(pijl ) = \u03b30 + \u03b31 \u03bb\u2032ij + \u03b7jp + \u01ebpjl , \u03b7jp \u223c N(0, \u03c3p1\n), \u01ebpjl \u223c N(0, \u03c3p2\n),\n\nwhere \u03bb\u2032ij is an approximately standardized value of \u03bbij . We allow individuals to have survival probabilities that depend on their mass, with additional temporal variability, modeled\n\n11\n\n\fas a random effect. We allow probability of capture to depend on body mass due to allow\nfor a sampling strategy that discriminated due to body mass, with additional variability\nwithin the secondary period and between primary periods, both modeled as a random effect. This is equivalent to specifying the closed population model Mt as a random effect,\nwith the mean varying between the primary periods. The priors for all parameters are\ngiven in the supplementary materials.\nIn order to determine the effect that rounding and censoring have on the results we\nobs\nalso fit the model with zijl = zijl\nwhen Xijl = 1.\n\nEach of the models was run in JAGS with an adaptive phase of 5000 iterations followed\nby a posterior sample of 20000 iterations. To ensure convergence we run 3 parallel chains\nwith different starting values and checked convergence with the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin\ndiagnostic (Brooks and Gelman 1998). We combined the posterior samples from the three\nchains to give a total posterior sample of 60000.\nThe results suggest that there is little practical difference between accounting for the\ncensoring of the covariate values and simply modeling using the raw observations (figure 1).\nWhile there are differences in the model for mass, particularly in the variances, this does\nnot translate to substantial differences in the model for survival or probability of capture.\nWhile mass appeared to be associated with the probability of capture, with larger animals\nhaving a higher chance of capture, there is no evidence of body mass being associated with\nsurvival. This result differs from Bonner and Schwarz (2006) and Schofield et al. (2009)\nwho found that body mass was not associated with either capture probability or survival.\nThis difference appears to be due to Bonner and Schwarz (2006) compressing the robust\ndesign into a more standard CJS design. To ensure that this is consistent with the data\nwe compared the observed data for individuals caught at least once in any given secondary\nperiod, with a significant increase in the average body mass as the number of captures\nincreases. After adjusting for the effect of body mass on capture probability, the abundance\n12\n\n\fof the meadow vole appears stable, fluctuating between \u223c 55 to \u223c 85 individuals during\nthe study (figure 1).\n\n4\n\nExample: Conjunctivitis in House Finch\n\nConn and Cooch (2009) used a multi-state model to study conjunctivitis in house finch,\nCarpodacus mexicanus, with 813 individuals caught in 16 samples. A two-state model\n(whether or not an individual had conjunctivitis) was used, with some individuals having\nunknown status. Our approach is to include all missing disease information using data\naugmentation and treating the disease as a individual-specific time-varying categorical\ncovariate (Dupuis 1995). Thus we can use the CDL in (1) with disease being the covariate z.\nSince the covariate takes two values, we can examine abundance, or any other demographic\nsummary, separately for each group.\nDupuis and Schwarz (2007) used the CDL to fit a multi-state model and estimate abundance. Their approach differs to ours due to different computational algorithms. To improve the efficiency of their MCMC sampling, they summed over the latent state variables\nzij when updating N. While this will yield a quicker algorithm, both in terms of mixing\nand time, it lacks generalizability beyond the multi-state model to, say, individual-specific\ntime-vary continuous covariates. In contrast, our approach allows us to apply the CDL\nacross a range of different models and different covariate distributions, including continuous\ncovariates, without major modifications in the JAGS/BUGS code.\nSince many individuals have uncertain disease status, even when encountered, we must\nconsider assumptions about the missingness of these observations (Rubin 1976). Here we\nassume that they are either missing completely at random or missing at random. In either\ncase, the process that describes how the data go missing does not need to be included in\nthe model. In the supplementary materials we describe and fit the model where we assume\n\n13\n\n\fthat the additional missing data is missing not at random. The results are very similar to\nthose from the model assuming the additional missing data is missing at random.\nThe CDL is given in (1) and we specify the birth component as in (2), the death\ncomponent as in (3) and the capture component as in (4). The only component left to\nspecify is the covariate, disease.\nWe specify the model for disease as\nN\nk\nY\nY\nz\n[z|\u03b8 , N] =\n[zibi |\u03b8 ]\n[zij |zij\u22121 , \u03b8z ]\nz\n\ni=1\n\n=\n\nN\nY\n\nj=bi +1\n\nCat((\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 ))\n\ni=1\n\nk\nY\n\nCat((\u03c9zij\u22121 1 , \u03c9zij\u22121 2 ))\n\nj=bi +1\n\nwhere Cat(\u03c0) is a categorical distribution with probability vector \u03c0. The covariate value\nzij = 2 indicates that individual i does has the disease in sample j and zij = 1 otherwise, \u03bdl\nis the probability of being in state l in the first sample after birth and \u03c9hl is the probability\nof moving from state h to state l. We use a generic categorical distribution (instead of the\nbinomial) to show how this model generalizes to more than two states.\nTo complete the model specification we model S and p as\n\nlogit(Sij ) = \u03b10 + \u03b11 I(zij = 2) + \u03b7jS , \u03b7jS \u223c N(0, \u03c3S2 ),\nlogit(pij ) = \u03b30 + \u03b31 I(zij = 2) + \u03b7jp , \u03b7jp \u223c N(0, \u03c3p2 ).\n\nWe allow individuals to have survival and capture probabilities that depend on their disease\nstatus, with temporal variability modeled as a random effect. The priors for all parameters\nare given in the supplementary materials.\nEach of the models was run in JAGS with an adaptive phase of 25000 iterations followed\nby a posterior sample of 25000 iterations. To ensure convergence we run 3 parallel chains\nwith different starting values and checked convergence with the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin\n14\n\n\fdiagnostic (Brooks and Gelman 1998). We combined the posterior samples from the three\nchains to give a total posterior sample of 75000.\nThe results suggest that disease status is associated with both survival and capture\nprobability (figure 2). Having conjunctivitis lowered the log-odds of survival, while increasing the log-odds of capture. The results for survival appear to agree with Conn and Cooch\n(2009), with no results for capture probability available to compare. The transition probabilities suggest that it is rare for an individual to develop conjunctivitis, with less than 5%\nof disease free animals contracting the disease (figure 2). However, once an individual has\nconjunctivitis it is somewhat difficult to become disease free, with around three quarters\nof individuals remaining in the disease state from one sample to the next. The population\nsize for diseased animals, while low, appears to be relatively stable with no fewer than 5\ndiseased individuals in the population (and as many as 40) during the study (figure 2). It\nis interesting to note that the population sizes for the diseased and non-diseased states,\nwhile similar, do not necessarily exhibit the same dynamics through time. In particular,\none could claim that there are periods where one class increases or decreases while the\nother remains relatively stable.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have shown how to use the framework of Schofield (2007), Schofield and Barker (2008,\n2009) to fit using JAGS or BUGS complex models where we estimate demographic summaries of interest in the presence of individual-specific time-varying covariates. The two\nexamples we show include modeling in the presence of covariate uncertainty and including\ndifferent study designs. The CDL conveniently factorizes so that we are able to specify\nseparate models for the birth, mortality, capture and covariate processes while fitting the\njoint model in JAGS or BUGS using MCMC methods. This means our focus can move from\n\n15\n\n\faccounting for the complex sampling process to focusing on specifying biologically meaningful models for the processes of interest, including hierarchical models for the parameters\nthat describe demographic changes in the population.\nThe house finch example shows how using the CDL facilitates modeling of missing\ndata, including covariate uncertainty. The model is identical to the one where all data\nwere actually observed, except that we must now consider, and potentially include, the\nprocess by which the data go missing. This is in contrast to the ODL where any missing\ndata, including covariate uncertainty, usually require specification of a new likelihood.\nExamples of this can be seen in Nichols et al. (2004) and Conn and Cooch (2009) where\nuncertainty in the covariate requires a new likelihood to be specified in order to include\nthe missing data.\nThe advantages in using the CDL for modeling comes at a computational cost. In a\nBayesian setting, all missing values are treated as 'unknowns', which means each missing\nvalue needs to be updated in every MCMC iteration. Thus the computational burden\nincreases with the amount of missing data. With current processor power, we are limited\nin the size of the data sets that we are able to fit. Using JAGS/BUGS, it can soon become\ndifficult to fit datasets with either a large number of individuals or many sampling periods.\nTo a large extent, these deficiencies can be overcome with user-written, application specific\ncode, making use of specialized algorithms and other computational advantages (such as\nDupuis and Schwarz (2007) for the multi-state model). However, this limits generalizability, with new algorithms needed for each application. These computational limitations,\nwhile serious, should not be an impediment to use. Advances in algorithms for MCMC\nand continuing increases in computational power mean that we will continue to be able to\nfit bigger and more complex models into the future.\nAn issue we have not mentioned is model checking. We suggest that model checking\nbe done using posterior predictive checking (Gelman et al. 2004, Pg. 159). One approach\n16\n\n\fis to focus on features of the data that are biologically important. For example, we may\nwant to ensure that our model explains the difference between the number of individuals\ncaught in successive sample occasions. We then generate replicate datasets from the fitted\nmodel and either (i) visually check, or (ii) specify an appropriate test-statistic, to see if the\nreplicates are consistent with the observed data. An example of a visual check is shown in\n(Gelman et al. 2004, Pg. 164-165) with the speed of light data.\nAn alternative approach is to make use of an omnibus test statistic to ensure that our\nfitted model does not generate data that are inconsistent with the data we have observed.\nApproaches that have been adopted in the Bayesian mark-recapture literature include use of\nthe likelihood function (King and Brooks 2002) or Freeman-Tukey statistic (Brooks et al.\n2000).\nGoodness-of-fit for mark-recapture models has received considerable attention in a frequentist setting (Pollock et al. 1985, Burnham et al. 1987, Barker 1999, Pradel et al. 2003).\nA constructive approach to goodness-of-fit testing can be taken when a multinomial model\nis used that is a member of the full exponential family based on the factorization\n\n[Data | MSS] \u00d7 [MSS |\u03b8].\n\nFor a large class of mark-recapture models the term [Data | MSS] has a hypergeometric\ndistribution and provides a natural partitioning of the data into test components. As far\nas we are aware an approach based on the predictive distribution [Data | MSS] has been\nlittle used in a Bayesian setting (see Wright et al. 2009, for an exception) but we believe\nthat this should be a productive approach to goodness-of-fit assessment.\nA related issue is model selection. We recommend different approaches to model selection depending on the objective of the study. If the objective is to learn about the system\nand to generate hypotheses about relationships then we advocate exploring the data and\n\n17\n\n\ffinding models that best fit the data. A number of models can be explored and compared using cross-validation (Hastie et al. 2009) as well as other criteria. If the objective\nis in validating previously generated hypotheses and making inference in the presence of\nmodel uncertainty, then we advocate exploring posterior model probabilities, or equivalently Bayes Factors, for a small set of scientifically driven models (Link and Barker 2006).\nBarker and Link (2010) outline an approach to calculating posterior model probabilities\nthat uses the output obtained from running the individual models using MCMC. Other\ntechniques for calculating posterior model probabilities are described in King et al. (2010).\nAnother possible approach to model selection involves specifying a hierarchical model, that\nhas as special cases, all models considered (Gelman et al. 2004, Pg. 405 \u2013 406). Then, instead of the usual approach of either including the effect or not including the effect before\npotentially combining the results using model-averaging, we can specify an informative\nprior distribution centered on zero, that can be viewed as a compromise between inclusion\nof the effect (with an approximately flat prior) and exclusion of the effect (with a prior\nwith all mass at zero). An example of this approach is when we have a potential time\neffect. Instead of choosing between a model with no time effect, and one with a separate\nand unrelated parameter for each time point, we can, as we do in the two examples here,\ninclude time as a random effect with the variance estimated from the data.\nThe CDL that we used to fit all models here can be extended in a number of ways. We\nexpect it to extend naturally to continuous data models. Depending on the observed data,\nwe would expect the CDL to remain the same, or at least similar, with the conditional\nlikelihood components relating to birth, death, capture and any covariates changing to\naccount for continuous time processes.\nAnother extension is when we have uncertainty in the tags themselves. An example\nof this is when our \"tag\" is a DNA profile of the individual. The problem here is that\nuncertainty in the DNA profile is due to various genotyping errors. The only change we\n18\n\n\frequire in our CDL is to include the true tag as missing data and include a component\nthat describes the corruption of the true tags to the observed tags. Wright et al. (2009)\nused this approach to estimate population size in a closed population study.\nUsing the CDL, we are able to model complex dependencies between individuals in\nthe population. For example, Schofield and Barker (2008) included density dependence on\nboth birth rates and survival probabilities. Another potential example is one where DNA\ninformation for one individual is able to provide information about another individual,\nsuch as parents and offspring. Information about the death of parent gives information\nabout the time of birth of the offspring and vice versa. The CDL approach is, at least in\nprinciple, able to include these relationships as well as including potential uncertainty in\nthe offspring/parent relationship.\n\nReferences\nBarker, R.
