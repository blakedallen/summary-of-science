The availability of ...\nwater in the indefinite future could change the entire face of Arizona, but the\ndevelopment of a space observatory may have rendered this eventuality of minor\nconsequence to the future of astronomy by that time.\" Aden Meinel, 1958\nOver 50 years ago, Aden Meinel selected Kitt Peak as a promising location for the\nnational observatory because of its high elevation, low humidity and pristine dark skies.\nBut contrary to Meinel's prediction, the lack of water in Tucson has done little to slow\nits growth. Instead, the population of neighboring Pima County, which contains Tucson,\nhas nearly quadrupled (U.S. Census Bureau: 1960, 20101) since Meinel spoke these words.\nPreviously, Massey et al. (1990) and Massey & Foltz (2000) discovered that this population\nincrease, and that of other neighboring towns, has had little affect on the Kitt Peak sky\nbrightness. Our research expands upon these studies by revisiting this question a full decade\nlater.\nTo make this determination, we used spectrophotometry rather than broadband measurements because spectrophotometry clearly shows the relative contribution of atmospheric\nand human-caused light sources. In contrast, broadband measurements only show the overall\nbrightness caused by all sources. Thus, it is very difficult to determine which specific lines\nare major contributors to the overall sky brightness. Our spectrophotometry focuses on the\nblue and yellow portions of the spectrum and puts less emphasis on the red, which is heavily\ndominated by OH emission intrinsic to the Earth's atmosphere.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Reductions\n\nWe strove to keep our observations as consistent with the 1988 and 1999 procedures\n(described in Massey et al. 1990 and Massey & Foltz 2000, respectfully) as the changing\nequipment allowed. The 2009/10 data were taken on the Kitt Peak 2.1 meter telescope\nusing the GoldCam CCD spectrometer during prime dark time. All observations were taken\nat least 15\u25e6 away from the ecliptic and the Galactic Plane, in order to avoid contributions\nfrom Zodiacal Light and the Milky Way. Measurements were made either at Zenith, or\n1\n\nhttp://www.census.gov\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nZenith distances of 60\u25e6 towards Tucson (azumuth = 64\u25e6 ), Phoenix (azimuth = 340\u25e6 ), Nogales\n(azimuth = 142\u25e6) or \"Nowhere\" (azimuth = 180\u25e6 ) as shown in Figure 1. A 600 mm\u22121 grating\n(\"No. 26 new\") was used in first order to provide a wavelength coverage of 3700 \u00c5 \u2013 6800 \u00c5\n(after the data were trimmed), with a dispersion of 1.24 \u00c5 per pixel. The data were binned\nby 3 pixels in the spatial direction to reduce noise (2.3\u2032\u2032 binned pixels). The wide slit resulted\nin a spectral resolution of 6.6 \u00c5 (5.3 pixels), comparable to that used in our earlier studies\n(Massey et al. 1990, Massey & Foltz 2000). Normally, a 150\u2032\u2032 metal decker plate was used\nto reduce scattered light, although for the October 2009 observations, a 100\u2032\u2032 decker was\n(accidentally) used.\nAll blank sky observations were taken in sets of three 15 minute exposures with the\ntelescope tracking on either (UT) 24 March 2009, 17 October 2009, 14 February 2010, 15\nFebruary 2010, 13 June 2010 or 14 June 2010. Between each exposure we reset the telescope\nback to the desired Zenith distance and azimuth. Based upon a visual inspection of the\nKitt Peak National Observatory all-sky camera2 and the sky, these appeared to be all-sky\nphotometric nights. We additionally observed \u223c10 spectrophotometric standards for flux\ncalibration purposes each night over a range of airmass (Massey et al. 1988).\nThe most difficult step when determining the sky brightness spectrophotometrically is to\ndetermine the plate scales, at the entrance slit and detector, accurately enough for precise (<\n0.05 magnitude) measurements. For the plate scale at the slit, we adopted the canonical 12.7\u2032\u2032\nmm\u22121 scale found in the observing manual. This is consistent with our own measurements\nof the scale from images taken with the direct CCD camera, which yields 0.305\u2032\u2032 per 24 \u03bcm\npixel on the direct CCD. Thus, we consider the scale at the slit to be determined to better\nthan 1%. We directly measured the scale at the detector using UCAC2 stars in M67 and\nobtained a scale of 0.765\u2032\u2032 \u00b1 0.003\u2032\u2032 per pixel based upon repeated measurements. So, this\nvalue is also known to much better than 1%.\nThe data were reduced in a manner similar to that of Massey & Foltz (2000). They\nwere first corrected for the bias level by removing the average value in the overscan strip on\na row-by-row basis. This removed some otherwise troublesome banding present in the data.\nWe examined an average bias frame and found no residual counts or structure greater than\n1 electron. The data were trimmed to 2531 pixels in the wavelength direction. Data outside\nof this region had poor focus or too few counts per exposure in the UV. We trimmed the\ndata to either 45 or 70 binned pixels in the spatial direction depending on which decker was\nused. A bad pixel mask was constructed from the division of long and short exposures of\nan internal quartz lamp, and was used to remove the few bad columns and occasional bad\n2\n\nhttp://www-kpno.kpno.noao.edu/Info/Mtn Weather/allsky/\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\npixel by linear interpolation. Dome flats were used to correct for pixel to pixel sensitivity\nvariations, the response of the grating in the wavelength direction, and first-order vignetting\nin the spatial direction. We then fit a function to the twilight flats to further correct for the\nslit illumination function which, on average, represented around a 3% change. Additionally,\nwe created a \"master\" sky image by combining the blank sky images for each night. A low\norder function was then fit to the spatial variance of this image and all of the images were\nthen divided by this fit as a further spatial correction, typically <1%. Finally, HeNeAr lamp\nexposures were used to provide wavelength calibrations.\nSince it was vital that our \"blank sky\" images be completely devoid of stars, we strove to\nposition our slit as far away from surrounding stars as possible. However, very dim stars did\noccasionally make their way into one of our frames. Thus, we combined our three consecutive\nimages using a discrepant pixel rejection algorithm (\"avsigclip\") using IRAF's3 \"imcombine\"\nroutine. This removed cosmic rays and the spectra of any faint, resolved star.\nThe standard star observations were extracted using a moderately wide extraction aperture, and we traced the spectrum along the detector. The same trace was used for the\ncomparison exposure in order to provide a wavelength scale. The standards were taken from\nMassey et al. (1988), and we constructed a wavelength-dependent sensitivity curve using\nthese data. The scatter of our (typically 10) standards was \u223c0.03 magnitudes. If the observations from two consecutive nights were involved, we combined the data using a common\nflat field. An average extinction curve was used to reduce the data. For the sky brightness\ndata we used an extraction aperture of either 40 pixels (30.6\u2032\u2032) or 60 pixels (45.9\u2032\u2032 ) depending\nupon the decker used.\nErrors for our data can be estimated as the quadrature sum of the individual uncertainties. The plate scale is well determined (<1%), as described previously. Nevertheless, in\nsetting the slit width to 395 \u03bcm (5.00\u2032\u2032 ) we relied upon our ability to read the micrometer\nsetting by eye, a process which was reproducible only at the 3 \u03bcm level. In addition, there\nwas the question of whether the slit was exactly fully closed when the micrometer read 0. We\nmeasured this repeatedly using exposures of an internal quartz lamp, varying the slit width,\nand found that the zero-point was no larger than 3 \u03bcm. Thus, our slit setting is probably\nuncertain by about 4 \u03bcm, or 2% (0.02 magnitudes). As described previously, the uncertainty\nin the plate scale at the detector is known to better than 1%. The adoption of a mean extinction curve was estimated by Massey & Foltz (2000) to add another 0.01 magnitude error,\n3\n\nIRAF is distributed by National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association\nof Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA) under cooperative agreement with the National\nScience Foundation.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nsince this affects only the wavelength dependent part of the extinction. The mean errors\nfrom the spectrophotometric standards adds another 0.03 magnitudes, a combination both\nof the uncertainty in the absolute calibration and probably variable slit losses. So in total,\nwe estimate the uncertainty in our spectrophotometry as 0.04 magnitudes.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nAlthough our goal was to obtain moderate resolution spectrophotometry, it is also useful\nto describe the data in terms of broad- and narrow-band indices, to facilitate comparison\nwith the previous two decades. The synthetic V and B magnitudes presented in Tables 1 and\n2 were computed using the filter functions determined by Bessell (1990). The convolutions\nfor both the broadband and narrowband magnitudes were performed on Vega using STIS\nspectrophotometry (Bohlin & Gilliland 2004) to determine the zero-points assuming that\nVega has a B and V magnitude of 0.03 (Bessell et al. 1988). The broadband magnitudes were\nthen computed after replacing 17 \u00c5 on both side of the highly variable OI 5577 atmospheric\nline by an averaged value. The narrowband magnitudes were computed using a constant\nresponse over a 100 \u00c5 interval centered at either \u03bb4250, \u03bb4550, or \u03bb5150. The 1988 and\n1999 magnitudes presented in Tables 1 and 2 do not perfectly match those of Massey et\nal. (1990) and Massey & Foltz (2000), as there was an error made in the conversion to the\nstandard system in the previous studies. The values given here are correct, and agree much\nbetter with other broadband measurements of the night sky brightness of Kitt Peak, e.g.,\nPilachowski et al. (1989).\nSince all of our 2009/10 data were taken on all-sky photometric nights, we were especially\ninterested in any night-to-night variations over our 15 month span of observations. Figure 2\npresents a comparison in the 2009/10 Zenith data. While the 2010 February and 2009 March\nZenith observations are almost indistinguishable, the 2009 October and 2010 June data both\ndiffer by close to a half a magnitude per arcsec2 in the red. For the October data, this\ntrend was also observed when looking at Tucson, Nogales, Phoenix and \"Nowhere\" and the\nbroadband V and B magnitudes in Table 1 also show that the October magnitudes are\nconsistently half a magnitude brighter. However, for the June data, dimming in the red was\nonly observed in the Zenith measurements. We haven't found any acceptable explanations\nfor this behavior. Though, a similar sky brightness study at Mt. Graham found that nonphotometric conditions can cause a 0.5 magnitude increase in sky brightness, consistent with\nour October results (Pedani 2009). Thus, when an average spectrum or magnitude is shown\n(such as in Table 2), we have combined only the February, March and June data except for\nat Zenith, where only the February and March data have been combined.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nArguably the most interesting decade to decade comparisons deal with the sky brightness\nat Tucson and Zenith. Figure 3 shows that in both cases the largest change in brightness\noccurred between 1988 and 1999 and after 1999, the sky appears to have gotten darker. A\nmagnitude comparison between the 1999 and 2009/10 values in Table 2 shows that both\nthe broadband and narrowband magnitudes additionally decreased. Much of this change\nmay be caused by the solar cycle as well as neighboring Pima County's stringent lightening\nordinances put into place in 2000, as discussed in Section 4.\nComparisons between the average spectra at Zenith and the average spectra at Tucson,\nPhoenix, Nogales and Nowhere for the 2009/10 data (as shown in Figure 4) reveal just how\nmuch the population of surrounding cities affects the sky glow. The most prominent difference is observed when looking at Tucson, as expected, but interestingly there is relatively no\ndifference between the spectra of Nogales and Nowhere. Additionally, according to Table 2,\nthe sky towards Phoenix is actually darker than the sky towards both Nowhere and Nogales.\nThis suggests that most of the light pollution is being caused by Tucson, even when looking\nin a completely different direction.\nWe also noticed a significant decrease in the sky brightness towards Tucson as the night\nprogressed. Figure 5 shows the sky spectrum in 2010 February at both three hours after\nsunset and nine hours after sunset. A comparison of the sky spectrum taken in 2009 October\nat two hours and eight hours after sunset shows a similar result. Since all of the observations\nwere taken when the sun was greater than 18\u25e6 below the horizon, we believe this change\nis due to households and businesses switching off their lights rather than the progression of\ntwilight.\nWe did attempt to quantify the changes seen in the integrated flux of just the region\naround the Na I D line, which is dominated by high- and low-pressure sodium lamps. The\nflux in this region is about 1 to 3\u00d710\u221215 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 for the Tucson and Phoenix\ndirections, and smaller for the other directions. The current data show no more flux than\nthe 1988 or 1999 data, and, if anything, is somewhat less. However, the variations within a\nsingle night of observations towards Tucson are more significant than the changes over the\npast two decades.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOverall, the sky brightness at Kitt Peak has remained remarkably constant over the\npast 20 years. While the magnitudes of many artificial sources have increased, this should\nhave little effect on astronomical spectroscopy unless the observer is particularly interested\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nin the Na I D lines.\nOther aspects besides artificial sources, such as the solar cycle, also contribute to the\nsky brightness (Pilachowski et al. 1989). As discussed in both Massey et al. (1990) and\nMassey & Foltz (2000), previous solar maximums occurred in July 1989 and March 2000,\ncorresponding almost perfectly with the first two studies. Even though these investigations\nhave been completed almost one solar cycle (11 years) later, Figure 6 shows that the solar\nflux changed quite drastically between our observations. While the 1999 data was taken at\na period close to the solar maximum, the 2009/10 data was taken at a clear solar minimum\nwhile the 1988 data was taken at an intermediate stage. This is a likely explanation for why\nthe 1999 data is significantly brighter than the 2009/10 data. The solar cycle should affect\nthe atmospheric lines (such as NI \u03bb5199, OI \u03bb5577 and OI \u03bb6300-64) as well as portions of\nthe blue and red \"pseudo-continuum.\" However, the NaI or HgI light pollution lines should\nnot be affected.\nIn an attempt to correct for the effects of the solar cycle on our data, we scaled our V\nand B magnitudes to the solar minimum using the knowledge that the sky gets brighter by\n\u223c0.4 magnitudes between the solar minimum and the solar maximum (Benn & Ellison 1998,\nPedani 2009), and the \"solar phases\" (based upon the solar flux) when our observations were\ntaken. These results are shown in Table 3 and suggest that while the observed sky brightness\nis comparable to what it was in 1999 (especially considering our 0.04 magnitude error), the\nsky has brightened at Zenith by approximately 0.1 magnitude since 1988. Similarly, these\ncorrected data suggest that while the sky towards both Tucson and \"nowhere\" has increased\nin brightness by approximately 0.3 magnitudes in V and B since 1988, they are actually\n\u223c0.1 magnitude darker than they were in 1999. Once needs to recall that these corrections\nare approximate, but they help place the measurements on a uniform (if hypothetical) basis.\nStill, the data is certainly very supportive of the view that lighting ordinances have been an\neffective tool despite the population growth.\nA comparison of our three datasets (1988, 1999 and 2009/10) highlights the robustness\nof our current study. In 1988, seven observations were made on a single night. In 1999,\nten observations were made on three nearly consecutive nights. In contrast, this study\nencompasses 30 observations on 6 nights and over a 15 month timespan. Besides the increased\nbaseline, our exposure times were longer by a factor of \u223c3. Thus, after another decade passes,\nwe hope to carry out a test as rigorous as the one just completed.\nWhile the arid conditions of southern Arizona failed to stem the region's growth, our\nresults show that the sky brightness hasn't increased proportionally with the population.\nOver the last two decades, both Pima and Maricopa Counties (which contain Tucson and\nPhoenix, respectively) have nearly doubled in size and Nogales and Santa Cruz County have\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nexperienced similar trends (U.S. Census Bureau: 1990, 2010). However, Pima County's 1974\nLighting ordinance, and its successors in 1987, 2000 and 2005 along with similar regulations\nimposed by the City of Tucson, have effectively stopped the impact of household, commercial\nand outdoor lights on the night sky. According to the Pima County Report (Davis et al.\n2006), light pollution at Kitt Peak has stabilized at 2005 levels and is expected to stay\nconstant until at least 2030. Additionally, in 1974, Turnrose published absolute spectrometry\nof the Palomar night sky, at a time when Palomar was considered one of the premiere dark\nobserving sites. His \u03bb4540 flux is equivalent to 22.30 magnitudes arcseconds\u22122 which is\ncomparable to our \u03bb4550 magnitudes presented in Table 2. Thus, Kitt Peak is currently just\nas dark as Palomar was in the mid-70s.\nAstronomy has a major impact on Arizona's state economy \u2013 $250 million in direct\nimpact every year as well as $1 billion in infrastructure (Eller College of Management, 2007).\nThus, the importance of keeping the skies dark extends far beyond the scope of Astronomy.\nLighting ordinances have saved the Kitt Peak night sky thus far, but as the populations of\nneighboring towns increase and grow closer to the mountain and as towns spring up around\nI-10, it will become more and more difficult to maintain the current light pollution levels.\nStill, our results show that Kitt Peak is essentially as dark now as it was in the late 1980s\nand if the lighting laws toughen as growth increases, there is no reason Kitt Peak can't retain\nthe pristine dark skies that Aden Meinel found so promising.\nThe authors wish to thank the former Kitt Peak Director, Buell Jannuzi, for encouraging\nthem to obtain a new data set and for being generous with the allocation of observing time\nto make this study possible. Dr. Jannuzi has been a tireless proponent of keeping the skies\nover Kitt Peak dark and working within the community to reduce light pollution through\neducation and advocacy. We also thank the Tohono O'odham National for being helpful in\ntheir choices for outdoor lighting, the International Dark Sky Association for spreading the\nword and surrounding governments for their continued willingness to consider the impact\nof their choices on the conduct of astronomy in southern Arizona. Our study shows that\nthese and other efforts have paid off. But, constant vigilance is essential. We would also like\nto thank Di Harmer for her strong support and advice, Bill Binkert for helping set up the\nspectrograph on occasion, Jeff Hall for helping us analyze the effects of the solar cycle on\nthe night sky brightness, the Friends of Lowell Observatory for publication costs, and the\nanonymous referee for their suggestions that helped improve the paper.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nREFERENCES\nBenn, C.
