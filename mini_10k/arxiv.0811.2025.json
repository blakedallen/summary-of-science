Introduction\nOne of the long-standing problems of modern strong-interaction physics is the origin of quark\nconfinement. Finite temperature gauge theories are advantageous in many aspects for the study of\nconfinement. The Polyakov loop operator P, given by\n\u0015\n\u0014Z \u03b2\ndtA4 (~x,t)\n(1.1)\nP (~x) = P exp i\n0\n\nrepresents the insertion of a static quark into a thermal system of gauge fields. It is the order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition in pure SU (N) gauge theories, with hTrF Pi = 0 in the\nconfined phase, and hTrF Pi 6= 0 in the deconfined phase. The deconfinement phase transition is associated with the spontaneous breaking of a global Z(N) symmetry P \u2192 zP where z = exp (2\u03c0 i/N)\nis the generator of Z(N).\nIt is remarkable that there is a simple class of Z(N)-invariant systems that are confining at\narbitrarily high temperatures, evading the transition to the deconfined phase found in the pure gauge\ntheory. A high-temperature confined phase is obtained from a pure gauge theory by the addition of\nfermions in the adjoint representation of SU (N), with the non-standard choice of periodic boundary\nconditions for the fermions in the timelike direction. If the number of adjoint fermion flavors N f is\nnot too large, these systems are asymptotically free at high temperature, and therefore the effective\npotential for P is calculable using perturbation theory. The system will lie in the confining phase\nif the fermion mass m is sufficiently light and N f > 1/2. In this case, electric string tensions\ncan be calculated perturbatively from the effective potential, and magnetic string tensions arise\nsemiclassically from non-Abelian magnetic monopoles. Thus the high-temperature confining phase\nprovides a realization of one of the oldest ideas about the origin of confinement.\n\n2. High Temperature Confinement\nThe one-loop effective potential for a boson in a representation R with spin degeneracy s\nmoving in a Polyakov loop background P at non-zero temperature and density is given by [1, 2]\nVb = sT\n\nZ\n\ndd k\n(2\u03c0 )\n\nh \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011i\n\u03b2 \u03bc \u2212\u03b2 \u03c9k\n+ \u2212\u03b2 \u03bc \u2212\u03b2 \u03c9k\nln\n1\n\u2212\nPe\nTr\n+\nln\n1\n\u2212\nP\ne\n.\nR\nd\n\n(2.1)\n\nPeriodic boundary conditions are assumed. With standard boundary conditions (periodic for bosons,\nantiperiodic for fermions), 1-loop effects always favor the deconfined phase. For the case of pure\ngauge theories, the one-loop effective potential can be written in the form\nVgauge (P, \u03b2 , m, N f ) =\n\n\u22122 \u221e TrA Pn\n\u2211 n4 .\n\u03c0 2 \u03b2 4 n=1\n\n(2.2)\n\nThis series is minimized, term by term if P \u2208 Z(N), so Z(N) symmetry is spontaneously broken\nat high temperature. The same result is obtained for any bosonic field with periodic boundary\nconditions or for fermions with antiperiodic boundary conditions.\nThe addition of fermions with periodic boundary conditions can restore the broken Z(N) symmetry. Consider the case of N f flavors of Dirac fermions in the adjoint representation of SU (N).\n2\n\n\fHigh Temperature Confinement in SU(N) Gauge Theories\n\nMichael Ogilvie\n\nPeriodic boundary conditions in the timelike direction imply that the generating function of the\nensemble, i.e., the partition function, is given by\nh\ni\nZ = Tr (\u22121)F e\u2212\u03b2 H\n(2.3)\n\nwhere F is the fermion number. This ensemble, familiar from supersymmetry, can be obtained\nfrom an ensemble at chemical potential \u03bc by the replacement \u03b2 \u03bc \u2192 i\u03c0 . In perturbation theory,\nthis shifts the Matsubara frequencies from \u03b2 \u03c9n = (2n + 1) \u03c0 to \u03b2 \u03c9n = 2n\u03c0 . The one loop effective\npotential is like that of a bosonic field, but with an overall negative sign due to fermi statistics [3].\nThe sum of the effective potential for the fermions plus that of the gauge bosons gives\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u221e TrA Pn\n2\n2 2\n2N f \u03b2 m K2 (n\u03b2 m) \u2212 2 .\n(2.4)\nV1\u2212loop (P, \u03b2 , m, N f ) = 2 4 \u2211\n\u03c0 \u03b2 n=1 n2\nn\nNote that the first term in brackets, due to the fermions, is positive for every value of n, while the\nsecond term, due to the gauge bosons, is negative.\nThe largest contribution to the effective potential at high temperatures is typically from the\nn = 1 term, which can be written simply as\ni\n\u0003h\n1 \u0002\n2\n2 2\n2N\nm\nK\n(\n|Tr\nP|\n\u2212\n1\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nm)\n\u2212\n2\nf\n2\nF\n\u03c0 2\u03b2 4\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere the overall sign depends only on N f and \u03b2 m. If N f \u2265 1 and \u03b2 m is sufficiently small, this term\nwill favor TrF P = 0. On the other hand, if \u03b2 m is sufficiently large, a value of P from the center,\nZ(N), is preferred. Note that an N = 1 super Yang-Mills theory would correspond to N f = 1/2 and\nm = 0, giving a vanishing perturbative contribution for all n [4, 5]. This suggests that it should be\npossible to obtain a Z(N) symmetric, confining phase at high temperatures using adjoint fermions\nwith periodic boundary conditions or some equivalent deformation of the theory.\nThis possibility has been confirmed in SU (3), where both lattice simulations and perturbative\ncalculations have been used to show that a gauge theory action with an extra term of the form\nR 4\nd x a1 TrA P is confining for sufficiently large a1 at arbitrarily high temperatures [6]. This simple,\none-term deformation is sufficient for SU (2) and SU (3). However, in the general case, a defor\u0002 \u0003\nmation with at least N2 terms is needed to assure confinement for representations of all possible\nnon-zero k-alities. Thus the minimal deformation necessary is of the form\n[ N2 ]\n\n\u2211 ak TrA Pk\n\n(2.6)\n\nk=1\n\nwhich is analyzed in detail in Joyce Myer's presentation in these procedings [7]. If all the coefficients ak are sufficiently large and positive, the free energy density\n[ N2 ]\n\u22122 \u221e TrA Pn\n+ \u2211 ak TrA Pk\nV1\u2212loop (P, \u03b2 , m, N f ) = 2 4 \u2211\n\u03c0 \u03b2 n=1 n4\nk=1\n\n(2.7)\n\nwill be minimized by a unique set of Polyakov loop eigenvalues corresponding to exact Z(N)\nsymmetry.\n3\n\n\fHigh Temperature Confinement in SU(N) Gauge Theories\n\nMichael Ogilvie\n\n\b\nThe unique set of SU (N) Polyakov eigenvalues invariant under Z(N) is w, wz, wz2 , .., wzN\u22121 ,\nwhere z = e2\u03c0 i/N is the generator of Z(N), and w is a phase necessary to ensure unitarity [8]. A\n\u0002\n\u0003\nmatrix with these eigenvalues, such as P0 = w * diag 1, z, z2 , .., zN\u22121 , is gauge-equivalent to itself\n\u0002 \u0003\nafter a Z(N) symmetry operation: zP0 = gP0 g+ . This guarantees that TrF P0k = 0 for any value\nof k not divisible by N, indicating confinement for all representations transforming non-trivially\nunder Z(N).\nTo prove that P0 is a global minimum of the effective potential, we use the high-temperature\nexpansion for the one-loop free energy of a particle in an arbitrary background Polyakov loop gauge\nequivalent to the matrix Pjk = \u03b4 jk ei\u03c6 j . The first two terms have the form [3]\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2 (2N f \u2212 1) T 4 \u03c0 4\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\u2248 \u2211 (1 \u2212 \u03b4 jk )\n\u2212\n(\u03c6 j \u2212 \u03c6k ) (\u03c6 j \u2212 \u03c6k \u2212 2\u03c0 )\nN\n\u03c02\n90 48\u03c0 2\nj,k=1\n\u0015\n\u0014\nN\nN f m2 T 2 \u03c0 2 1\n1\n+ (\u03c6 j \u2212 \u03c6k ) (\u03c6 j \u2212 \u03c6k \u2212 2\u03c0 ) .\n\u2212 \u2211 (1 \u2212 \u03b4 jk )\nN\n\u03c02\n6\n4\nj,k=1\nN\n\nV1\u2212loop\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe T 4 term dominates for m/T \u226a 1, and has P0 as a minimum provided N f > 1/2. Even if\nthe adjoint fermion mass is enhanced by chiral symmetry breaking, as would be expected in a\nconfining phase, it should be of order gT or less, and the second term in the expansion of V1\u2212loop\ncan be neglected at sufficiently high temperture.\n\n3.

Timelike string tensions are calculable perturbatively in the hightemperature confining region from small fluctuations about the confining minimum of the effective\npotential [10]. The scale is naturally of order gT :\n!\n(t) 2\n\u03c3k\n2N f m2 \u221e\n= g2 N\n\u2211 [K2 ((k + jN)\u03b2 m) + K2 ((N \u2212 k + jN)\u03b2 m) \u2212 2K2 (( j + 1)N \u03b2 m)]\nT\n2\u03c0 2 j=0\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012 \u0013\nT2\n2 \u03c0k\n2\n\u22121 .\n(3.5)\n\u2212g N 2 3 csc\n3N\nN\n4\n\n\fHigh Temperature Confinement in SU(N) Gauge Theories\n\nMichael Ogilvie\n\nThese string tensions are continuous functions of \u03b2 m. The m = 0 limit is simple:\n!\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012 \u0013\n(t) 2\n\u03c3k\n(2N f \u2212 1) g2 T 2\n2 \u03c0k\n=\n3 csc\n\u22121\nT\n3N\nN\n\n(3.6)\n\nand is a good approximation for \u03b2 m \u226a 1. This scaling law is not at all like either Casimir or sine(t)\n(t)\nlaw scaling, because the usual hierarchy \u03c3k+1 \u2265 \u03c3k is here reversed. Because we expect on the\nbasis of SU (3) simulations that the high-temperature confining region is continuously connected to\nthe conventional low-temperature region, there must be an inversion of the string tension hierarchy\nbetween the two regions for all N \u2265 4.\n\n4. Spatial String Tensions\nThe confining minimum P0 of the effective potential breaks SU (N) to U (1)N\u22121 . This remaining unbroken Abelian gauge group naively seems to preclude spatial confinement, in the sense of\narea law behavior for spatial Wilson loops. However, as first discussed by Polyakov in the case\nof an SU (2) Higgs model in 2 + 1 dimensions, instantons can lead to nonperturbative confinement\n[11]. In the high-temperature confining region, the dynamics of the magnetic sector are effectively\nthree-dimensional due to dimensional reduction. The Polyakov loop plays a role similar to an adjoint Higgs field, with the important difference that P lies in the gauge group, while a Higgs field\nwould lie in the gauge algebra. The standard topological analysis [12] is therefore slightly altered,\nand there are N fundamental monopoles in the finite temperature gauge theory [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]\nwith charges proportional to the affine roots of SU (N), given by 2\u03c0\u03b1 j /g where \u03b1 j = \u00ea j \u2212 \u00ea j+1 for\nj = 1 to N \u2212 1 and \u03b1N = \u00eaN \u2212 \u00ea1 . Monopole effects will be suppressed by powers of the Boltzmann\nfactor exp [\u2212E j /T ] where E j is the energy of a monopole associated with \u03b1 j .\nIn the high-temperature confining region, monopoles interact with each other through both\ntheir long-ranged magnetic fields, and also via a three-dimensional scalar interaction, mediated\nby A4 . The scalar interaction is short-ranged, falling off with a mass of order gT . The long-range\nproperties of the magnetic sector may be represented in a simple form by a generalized sine-Gordon\nmodel which generates the grand canonical ensemble for the monopole/anti-monopole gas [18].\nThe action for this model represents the Abelian dual form of the magnetic sector of the U (1)N\u22121\ngauge theory. It is given by\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013#\nZ\nN\n2\nT\n\u03c0\n\u03b1j * \u03c1\n(4.1)\n(\u2202 \u03c1 )2 \u2212 2\u03be \u2211 cos\nSmag = d 3 x\n2\ng\nj=1\nwhere \u03c1 is the scalar field dual to the U (1)N\u22121 magnetic field. The monopole fugacity \u03be is given\nby exp [\u2212E j /T ] times functional determinantal factors [19].\nThis Lagrangian is a generalization of the one considered by Polyakov for SU (2), and the\nanalysis of magnetic confinement follows along the same lines [11]. The Lagrangian has N degenerate inequivalent minima \u03c10k = g\u03bck where the \u03bck 's are the simple fundamental weights, satisfying\n\u03b1 j * \u03bck = \u03b4 jk . Note that e2\u03c0 i\u03bck = zk .

Moving this\ndiscontinuity out to spatial infinity, the string tension of the spatial Wilson loop is the interfacial\nenergy of a one-dimensional kink interpolating between the vacua \u03c10k . The calculation is similar to\nthat of the 't Hooft loop in the deconfined phase, where the kinks interpolate between the N different\nsolutions associated with the spontaneous breaking of SU (N). The main technical difficulty lies in\nfinding the correct kink solutions.

The square-rootCasimir scaling behavior obtained differs significantly from both Casimir and sine-law scaling, and\nshould be easily distinguishable in lattice simulations.\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe have been able to predict analytically a number of properties of the high temperature\nconfined region, which lattice simulations should be able to confirm. The phase structure and\nthermodynamics of these models are particularly rich for N \u2265 4. However, even in the case of\nSU (2), there is an interesting prediction of a first-order transition between the deconfined phase\nand the high-temperature confined region as the adjoint fermion mass is varied. It follows that\nthere must be a tricritical point in the \u03b2 \u2212 m plane somewhere on the critical line separating the\nconfined and deconfined phases. There is a perturbative prediction for an inverted hierarchy of\ntimelike string tensions for N \u2265 4. There is also a semiclassical expression for spacelike string\ntensions, which are predicted to be proportional to the square root of the monopole fugacity.\nThese predictions for the high-temperature region lead naturally to additional questions that\nlattice simulations can address, but semiclassical methods most likely cannot. Lattice simulations\ncan explore the crossover from conventional, low-temperature confining behavior to the behavior\npredicted in the high-temperature confining region. Some features can be studied in simulations\nwhere a simple deformation of the action is used, as in [6]. In addition to the string tensions, these\nfeatures include monopole and instanton densities, and the topological susceptibility. Other aspects\nwill require the inclusion of adjoint dynamical fermions in lattice simulations. Chiral symmetry\nbreaking is of particular interest. Unsal [21, 22] has proposed a detailed picture of chiral symmetry\nbreaking which can be independently checked by simulation. The accessibility of lattice field\nconfigurations as well as conventional observables makes the high-temperature confined region a\nnatural place to explore the overlap of theory and simulation.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
