There is no need of an ad-hoc scalar field to be introduced in order to explain the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation, all\nthe ingredients are present within a minimal supersymmetric Standard Model. The\nmodel is robust enough to provide a successful exit from inflation with all observed\nmatter in the universe. This is a triumph for an inflationary paradigm which has\nalways begged a simple question: can we identify the inflaton in a laboratory. We\nwill briefly discuss how LHC can shed some insight into the inflaton.\n\n\fInflation has been extremely successful in explaining the temperature anisotropy\nof the observed comsic microwave background radiation by generating almost scale\ninvariant density perturbations [1]. (for a theory of density perturbations see [2]). It\nhas been known for almost 26 years that inflation can be driven by a dynamical scalar\nfield known as the inflaton, an order parameter, which could either be fundamental or\ncomposite. Particularly, if the inflaton rolls very slowly on a sufficiently flat potential,\nsuch that the potential energy density dominates over the kinetic term, then all the\nsuccesses of inflation can be met, i.e. dynamical explanation of the homogeneity\nand the isotropy of the universe on very large scales (for a review see [3]), Gaussian\ndensity perturbations, etc.\nHowever, inspite of the impressive list of achievements, inflation was never embedded in a fundamental theory which could also be testable in a laboratory. Inspite\nof many attempts there has been no single good candidate for an inflaton which\ncomes naturally out of a well motivated theory of particle physics (for a review on\nmodels of inflation, see [4]). One always relies on scalar fields which are absolute\ngauge singlets possibly residing in some hidden sector or secluded sector with a small\ncoupling to the SM gauge group. By definition an absolute gauge singlet does not\ncarry any charge what so-ever be the case. Therefore the masses, couplings and interactions are not generally tied to any fundamental theory or any symmetry. Such\ngauge singlets are used ubiquitously by model builders to obtain a desired potential and interactions at a free will in order to explain the current CMB data. Not\nonly that many notable papers use ad-hoc couplings to explain phenomena such as\npreheating and thermalization without bothering the relevant degrees of freedom\nrequired to create a Universe like ours.\nVery recently some of these questions have been addressed in a low energy field\ntheory setup which explains (for a review see [5]):\n\u2022 the origin of inflation\n\u2022 the fundamental interactions of an inflaton\n\u2022 how the inflaton creates Standard Model baryons and cold dark matter ?\n\u2022 and how can we test the inflaton in a laboratory ?\nFor the first time we are aiming to build a holistic model of inflation which\nis truly embedded in a Standard Model (SM) gauge theory. The inflaton carries\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f0.5\n0.4\n0.3\nVHxL\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\nx\n\nFigure\n\n1:\n\nV (\u03c6)/(0.5\n\nThe colored\n\nm2\u03c6 MP2 (m\u03c6 /MP )1/2 ),\n\ncurves\n\ndepict the full potential,\n\nand x \u2261\n\n(\u03bbn MP /m\u03c6 )1/4 (\u03c6/MP ).\n\nwhere V (x)\n\n\u2261\n\nThe black curve is the\n\npotential arising from the soft SUSY breaking mass term. The black dots on the colored\npotentials illustrate the gradual transition from minimum to the saddle point and to the\nmaximum.\n\nthe SM charges and inflation occurs within an observable sector if the low energy\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) is found just above the electroweak scale at the LHC [6, 7, 8,\n9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. We will explain below why SUSY is necessary to build a successful\ninflation model. SUSY provides the scalar fields (partners of the SM fermions and\ngauge bosons) and the stability of the flatness of the inflaton potential.\nFurthermore, since the inflaton carries the SM charges, it decays only into the\nSM particles and SUSY particles, i.e. quarks, squarks, leptons, sleptons, etc. Within\na minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) we know all the relativistic\nspecies and therefore we can trace back thermal history of the universe accurately\nabove the electroweak scale. We highlight that all the relevant physical processes\nare happening within an observable sector alone. If the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP) is stable due to R-parity, we naturally obtain cold dark matter as a\nconsequence of inflation [10].\nLet us now concentrate on the model of inflation which is based on MSSM together with gravity [6, 7, 10]. Therefore consistency dictates that all non-renormalizable\nterms allowed by gauge symmetry and supersymmetry should be included below the\ncut-off scale, which we take to be the Planck scale. The superpotential term which\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\flifts the F -flatness is given by (see for a review [14]):\nWnon =\n\nX \u03bbn \u03a6n\n,\nn M n\u22123\nn>3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is a gauge invariant superfield which contains the flat direction. Within\nMSSM all the flat directions are lifted by non-renormalizable operators with 4 \u2264\n\nn \u2264 9 [15], where n depends on the flat direction. We expect that quantum gravity\n\neffects yield M = MP = 2.4 \u00d7 1018 GeV and \u03bbn \u223c O(1) [16]. Note however that our\n\nresults will be valid for any values of \u03bbn , because rescaling \u03bbn simply shifts the VEV\nof the flat direction. Let us focus on the lowest order superpotential term in Eq. (1)\nwhich lifts the flat direction. Soft SUSY breaking induces a mass term for \u03c6 and an\nA-term so that the scalar potential along the flat direction reads\n2(n\u22121)\n1 2 2\n\u03bbn \u03c6 n\n2 \u03c6\nV = m\u03c6 \u03c6 + A cos(n\u03b8 + \u03b8A )\n+ \u03bbn 2(n\u22123) ,\n2\nn MPn\u22123\nMP\n\n(2)\n\nHere \u03c6 and \u03b8 denote respectively the radial and the angular coordinates of the complex scalar field \u03a6 = \u03c6 exp[i\u03b8], while \u03b8A is the phase of the A-term (thus A is a\npositive quantity with dimension of mass). Note that the first and third terms in\nEq. (2) are positive definite, while the A-term leads to a negative contribution along\nthe directions whenever cos(n\u03b8 + \u03b8A ) < 0, see 1. The importance of the A-term was\nfirst highlighted in a successful MSSM curvaton model [17] 1 .\nThe maximum impact from the A-term is obtained when cos(n\u03b8 + \u03b8A ) = \u22121\n\n(which occurs for n values of \u03b8). For a choice of parameter, A2 = 8(n \u2212 1)m2\u03c6 , the\n\npotential is flat near \u03c60 , where first and second derivative of the potential vanishes,\n\ni.e. V \u2032 (\u03c60 ) = 0, V \u2032\u2032 (\u03c60 ) = 0. As a result, if initially \u03c6 \u223c \u03c60 , a slow roll phase of\ninflation is driven by the third derivative of the potential. We will show that the\npotential near \u03c60 becomes cosmologically flat. As a matter of fact in the gravity\nmediated SUSY breaking case, the A-term and the soft SUSY breaking mass terms\nare expected to be the same order of magnitude as the gravitino mass, i.e. m\u03c6 \u223c\nA \u223c m3/2 \u223c O(1) TeV see [19].\n\nIf the above condition is not satisfied then for A2 \u2265 8(n \u2212 1)m2\u03c6 the potential\n\ndevelops a secondary false minimum with a charge and color breaking minimum.\n\nAlthough inflation could occur there [20] but phenomenologically such a situation\nis not desired at all. In the other extreme case it is possible to drive assisted [21]\n1\n\nSimilar ideas for the curvaton to carry the SM charges have been entertained in [18].\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\finflation with many flat directions, however, such a possibility does not arise within\nMSSM [22].\nThe potential near the saddle point, A2 = 8(n \u2212 1)m2\u03c6 , is very flat along the real\n\ndirection but not along the imaginary direction. Along the imaginary direction the\ncurvature is determined by m\u03c6 . Around \u03c60 the field lies in a plateau with a potential\nenergy\nV (\u03c60 ) =\nwith\n\n(n \u2212 2)2\nm2 \u03c62\n2n(n \u2212 1) \u03c6 0\n\n(3)\n\n\u00131/(n\u22122)\nm\u03c6 MPn\u22123\n\u221a\n.\n\u03c60 =\n\u03bbn 2n \u2212 2\nThis results in Hubble expansion rate during inflation which is given by\n\u0012\n\n(n \u2212 2) m\u03c6 \u03c60\nHinf = p\n.\n6n(n \u2212 1) MP\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nWhen \u03c6 is very close to \u03c60 , the first derivative is extremely small. The field is\neffectively in a de Sitter background, and we are in self-reproduction (or eternal\ninflation) regime where the two point correlation function for the flat direction fluctuation grows with time. But eventually classical friction wins and slow roll begins\nat \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6self [6, 7]\n(\u03c60 \u2212 \u03c6self ) \u2243\n\n\u0010 m \u03c62 \u00111/2\n\u03c6 0\n\u03c60 .\nMP3\n\n(6)\n\nThe regime of eternal inflation plays an important role in addressing the initial\ncondition problem [11].\nThe observationally relevant perturbations are generated when \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6COBE .

The flatness constraints require that a 6= b and i 6= j 6= k. Both these flat\ndirections are lifted by n = 6 non-renormalizable operators [15],\nW6 \u2283\n\n1\n(LLe)(LLe) ,\nMP3\n\nW6 \u2283\n\n1\n(udd)(udd) .\nMP3\n\n(13)\n\nThe reason for choosing either of these two flat directions3 is twofold: (i) a nontrivial A-term arises, at the lowest order, only at n = 6; and (ii) we wish to obtain\nthe correct COBE normalization of the CMB spectrum.\nThose MSSM flat directions which are lifted by operators with dimension n = 7, 9\nare such that the superpotential term contains at least two monomials, i.e. is of the\ntype\nW \u223c\n\n1\nMPn\u22123\n\n\u03a8\u03a6n\u22121 .\n\n(14)\n\nIf \u03c6 represents the flat direction, then its VEV induces a large effective mass term for\n\u03c8, through Yukawa couplings, so that h\u03c8i = 0. Hence Eq. (14) does not contribute\nto the A-term.\n\nMore importantly, as we will see, all other flat directions except those lifted by\nn = 6 fail to yield the right amplitude for the density perturbations. Indeed, as can\nbe seen in Eq. (4), the value of \u03c60 , and hence also the energy density, depend on n.\n2\n\nWhen the flat direction develops a VEV during inflation, it spontaneously breaks SU (2)\u00d7U (1)y ,\n\nwhich gives masses to the corresponding gauge bosons. It is possible to obtain a seed perturbations\nfor the primordial magnetic field in this case, see [23].\n3\nSince LLe are udd are independently D- and F -flat, inflation could take place along any of\nthem but also, at least in principle, simultaneously. The dynamics of multiple flat directions are\nhowever quite involved [24].\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fAccording to the arguments presented above, successful MSSM flat direction\ninflation has the following model parameters:\nm\u03c6 \u223c 1 \u2212 10 TeV , n = 6 , A =\n\n\u221a\n\n40m\u03c6 , \u03bb \u223c O(1) .\n\n(15)\n\nHere we assume that \u03bb (we drop the subscript \"6\") is of order one, which is the most\nnatural assumption when M = MP .\nThe Hubble expansion rate during inflation and the VEV of the saddle point\nare\n\n4\n\nHinf \u223c 1 \u2212 10 GeV ,\n\n\u03c60 \u223c (1 \u2212 3) \u00d7 1014 GeV .\n\n(16)\n\nNote that both the scales are sub-Planckian. The total energy density stored in the\ninflaton potential is V0 \u223c 1036 \u2212 1038 GeV4 . The fact that \u03c60 is sub-Planckian guarantees that the inflationary potential is free from the uncertainties about physics at\nsuper-Planckian VEVs. The total number of e-foldings during the slow roll evolution\nis large enough to dilute any dangerous relic away [7],\nNtot \u223c 103 ,\n\n(17)\n\nAt such low scales as in MSSM inflation the number of e-foldings, NCOBE , required for\nthe observationally relevant perturbations, is much less than 60 [25]. If the inflaton\n\ndecays immediately after the end of inflation, we obtain NCOBE \u223c 50. Despite the\nlow scale, the flat direction can generate adequate density perturbations as required\n\nto explain the COBE normalization. This is due to the extreme flatness of the\npotential (recall that V \u2032 = 0), which causes the velocity of the rolling flat direction\nto be extremely small. From Eq. (8) we find an amplitude of\n\u03b4H \u2243 1.91 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\n(18)\n\nThere is a constraint on the mass of the flat direction from the amplitude of the\nCMB anisotropy:\nm\u03c6 \u2243 (100 GeV) \u00d7 \u03bb\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0012\n\nNCOBE\n50\n\n\u0013\u22124\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nWe get a lower limit on the mass parameter when \u03bb \u2264 1. For smaller values of\n\u03bb \u226a 1, the mass of the flat direction must be larger. Note that the above bound on\n\nthe inflaton mass arises at high scales, i.e. \u03c6 = \u03c60 . However, through renormalization\ngroup flow, it is connected to the low scale mass, as will be discussed in Sect. 4.\n4\n\nWe note that Hinf and \u03c60 depend very mildly on \u03bb as they are both \u221d \u03bb\u22121/4 .\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fThe spectral tilt of the power spectrum is not negligible because, although the\n4\nfirst slow roll parameter is \u01eb \u223c 1/NCOBE\n\u226a 1, the other slow roll parameter is given\n\nby \u03b7 = \u22122/NCOBE and thus, see Eq. (9)5\n\nns \u223c 0.92 ,\nd ns\n\u223c \u22120.002 ,\nd ln k\n\n(20)\n(21)\n\nwhere we have taken NCOBE \u223c 50 (which is the maximum value allowed for the\n\nscale of inflation in our model). In the absence of tensor modes, this agrees with\n\nthe current WMAP 3-years' data within 2\u03c3 [1]. Note that MSSM inflation does not\nproduce any large stochastic gravitational wave background during inflation. Gravity\nwaves depend on the Hubble expansion rate, and in our case the energy density stored\nin MSSM inflation is very small. Inflation can still happen for small deviations from\nthe saddle point condition, A2 = 8(n \u2212 1)m2\u03c6 . Notable point is that the spectral tilt\n\ncan match the current observations, i.e. within 0.92 \u2264 ns \u2264 1.0. The plot above\nsummarizes the results.\n\nThe blue band above shows the experimentally allowed region. We find that\nsmaller values of m\u03c6 are preferred for smaller values of ns . We also find that the\nallowed range of m\u03c6 is 75 \u2212 440 GeV for the experimental ranges of ns and \u03b4H . We\nassume \u03bb \u223c 1 for these two figures. If \u03bb is less than O(1), e.g., \u03bb \u223c 0.1 or so (which\ncan occur in SO(10) model), it will lead to an increase in m\u03c6 .\n\nSince the MSSM inflaton candidates are represented by gauge invariant combinations which are not singlets. The inflaton parameters receive corrections from gauge\ninteractions which, unlike in models with a gauge singlet inflaton, can be computed\nin a straightforward way. Quantum corrections result in a logarithmic running of\nthe soft supersymmetry breaking parameters m\u03c6 and A. The conclusion is robust,\nalthough the soft terms and the value of the saddle point are all affected by radiative\ncorrections, they do not remove the saddle point nor shift it to unreasonable values.\nThe existence of a saddle point is thus insensitive to radiative corrections.\nOne final comment is in order before closing this Section. Unlike m\u03c6 , there is\nno prospect of measuring the A term, because it is related to the non-renormalizable\ninteractions which are suppressed by MP . However, a knowledge of supersymmetry\n5\n\nObtaining ns > 0.92 (or ns < 0.92, which is however outside the 2\u03c3 allowed region) requires\n\ndeviation from the saddle point condition, A2 = 8(n \u2212 1)m2\u03c6 , see the discussion below. For a more\n\ndetailed discussion on the spectral tilt, see also Refs.

For\ninstance in the Polonyi model the non-renormalizable A-term and the trilinear Aterm can be related to each other: A6 =\n\n\u221a\n3\u2212\u221a3\nA.\n6\u2212 3 3\n\nSUGRA corrections often destroy the slow roll predictions of inflationary potentials; this is the notorious SUGRA-\u03b7 problem [27].\n\u0010 In general, the\n\u0011 effective potential\n\u2217\n2\ndepends on the K\u00e4hler potential K as V \u223c eK(\u03c6 ,\u03c6)/MP V (\u03c6) so that there is a\n\ngeneric SUGRA contribution to the flat direction potential of the type\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c6\n2\n2\nV (\u03c6) = H MP f\n,\nMP\n\n(22)\n\nwhere f is some function (typically a polynomial). Such a contribution usually gives\nrise to a Hubble induced correction to the mass of the flat direction with an unknown\ncoefficient, which depends on the nature of the K\u00e4hler potential 6 .\nLet us compare the non-gravitational contribution, Eq. (2), to that of Hubble\ninduced contribution, Eq. (22). Writing f \u223c (\u03c6/MP )p where p \u2265 1 is some power,\n6\n\nIf the K\u00e4hler potential has a shift symmetry, then at tree level there is no Hubble induced correc-\n\ntion. However, at one-loop level relatively small Hubble induced corrections can be induced [29, 30].\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fwe see that non-gravitational part dominates whenever\n2\nHinf\nMP2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c6\nMP\n\n\u0013p\n\n\u226a m2\u03c6 \u03c620 ,\n\n(23)\n\nso that the SUGRA corrections are negligible as long as \u03c60 \u226a MP , as is the case\n\nhere (note that Hinf MP \u223c m\u03c6 \u03c60 ). The absence of SUGRA corrections is a generic\nproperty of this model. Note also that although non-trivial K\u00e4hler potentials give\n\nrise to non-canonical kinetic terms of squarks and sleptons, it is a trivial exercise to\nshow that at sufficiently low scales, Hinf \u226a m\u03c6 , and small VEVs, they can be rotated\n\nto a canonical form without affecting the potential 7 .\n\nAfter the end of inflation, the flat direction starts rolling towards its global\nminimum. At this stage the dominant term in the scalar potential will be: m\u03c6 \u03c62 /2.\nSince the frequency of oscillations is \u03c9 \u223c m\u03c6 \u223c 103 Hinf , the flat direction oscillates a\nlarge number of times within the first Hubble time after the end of inflation. Hence\nthe effect of expansion is negligible.\nWe recall that the curvature of the potential along the angular direction is much\n2\nlarger than Hinf\n. Therefore, the flat direction has settled at one of the minima along\n\nthe angular direction during inflation from which it cannot be displaced by quantum\nfluctuations. This implies that no torque will be exerted, and hence the flat direction\nmotion will be one dimensional, i.e. along the radial direction.\nFlat direction oscillations excite those MSSM degrees of freedom which are coupled to it. The inflaton, either LLe or udd flat direction, is a linear combination of\nslepton or squark fields. Therefore inflaton has gauge couplings to the gauge/gaugino\nfields and Yukawa couplings to the Higgs/Higgsino fields. As we will see particles with\na larger couplings are produced more copiously during inflaton oscillations. Therefore we focus on the production of gauge fields and gauginos. Keep in mind that\nthe VEV of the MSSM flat direction breaks the gauge symmetry spontaneously, for\ninstance udd breaks SU(3)C \u00d7 U(1)Y while LLe breaks SU(2)W \u00d7 U(1)Y , therefore,\n\ninduces a supersymmetry conserving mass \u223c gh\u03c6(t)i to the gauge/gaugino fields in\n\na similar way as the Higgs mechanism, where g is a gauge coupling. When the flat\ndirection goes to its minimum, h\u03c6(t)i = 0, the gauge symmetry is restored. In this\n\nrespect the origin is a point of enhanced symmetry [31].\n7\n\nThe same reason, i.e. Hinf \u226a m\u03c6 also precludes any large Trans-Planckian correction. Any\n\nsuch correction would generically go as (Hinf /M\u2217 )2 \u226a 1, where M\u2217 is the scale at which one would\n\nexpect Trans-Planckian effects to kick in.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fThere can be various phases of particle creation in this model, here we briefly\nsummarize the most dominant one. Let us elucidate the physics, by considering the\ncase when LLe flat direction is the inflaton\n\n8\n\n.\n\nAn efficient bout of particle creation occurs when the inflaton crosses the origin,\nwhich happens twice in every oscillation. The reason is that fields which are coupled\nto the inflaton are massless near the point of enhanced symmetry. Mainly electroweak\ngauge fields and gauginos are then created as they have the largest coupling to the flat\ndirection. The production takes place in a short interval, \u2206t \u223c (gm\u03c6 \u03c60 )\u22121/2 , where\n\n\u03c60 \u223c 1014 GeV is the initial amplitude of the inflaton oscillation, during which quanta\n\n1/2\nwith a physical momentum k <\n\u223c (gm\u03c6 \u03c60 ) are produced. The number density of\ngauge/gaugino degrees of freedom is given by [35], see also [36]\n\n(gm\u03c6 \u03c60 )3/2\nng \u2248\n.\n8\u03c0 3\n\n(24)\n\nAs the inflaton VEV is rolling back to its maximum value \u03c60 , the mass of the produced quanta gh\u03c6(t)i increases. The gauge and gaugino fields can (perturbatively)\ndecay to the fields which are not coupled to the inflaton, for instance to (s)quarks.\nNote that (s)quarks are not coupled to the flat direction, hence they remain massless\nthroughout the oscillations. The total decay rate of the gauge/gaugino fields is then\ngiven by \u0393 = C (g 2 /48\u03c0) g\u03c6, where C \u223c O(10) is a numerical factor counting for the\nmultiplicity of final states.\n\nThe decay of the gauge/gauginos become efficient when [7]\nh\u03c6i \u2243\n\n\u0012\n\n48\u03c0m\u03c6 \u03c60\nCg 3\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(25)\n\nHere we have used h\u03c6(t)i \u2248 \u03c60 m\u03c6 t, which is valid when m\u03c6 t \u226a 1, and \u0393 \u2243 t\u22121 , where\n\nt represents the time that has elapsed from the moment that the inflaton crossed the\norigin. Note that the decay is very quick compared with the frequency of inflaton\noscillations, i.e. \u0393 \u226b m\u03c6 . It produces relativistic (s)quarks with an energy [7]:\n1\nE = g\u03c6(t) \u2243\n2\n8\n\n\u0012\n\n48\u03c0m\u03c6 \u03c60\nCg\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nReheating happens quickly due to a flat direction motion which is strictly one dimensional in\n\nour case. Our case is really exceptional, usually, the flat direction motion is restricted to a plane,\nwhich precludes preheating all together, for instance see [32, 33].\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fThe ratio of energy density in relativistic particles thus produced \u03c1rel with respect to\nthe total energy density \u03c10 follows from Eqs. (24,26):\n\u03c1rel\n\u223c 10\u22122 g ,\n\u03c10\n\n(27)\n\nwhere we have used C \u223c O(10). This implies that a fraction \u223c O(10\u22122) of the infla-\n\nton energy density is transferred into relativistic (s)quarks every time that the infla-\n\nton passes through the origin. This is so-called instant preheating mechanism [37] 9 .\nIt is quite an efficient mechanism in our model as it can convert almost all of\nthe energy density in the inflaton into radiation within a Hubble time (note that\n\u22121\nHinf\n\u223c 103 m\u22121\n\u03c6 ).\n\nA full thermal equilibrium is reached when a) kinetic and b) chemical equilibrium\n\nare established. The maximum (hypothetical) temperature attained by the plasma\nwould be given by:\nTmax \u223c V 1/4 \u223c (m\u03c6 \u03c60 )1/2 \u2265 109 GeV .\n\n(28)\n\nThis temperature may be too high and could lead to thermal overproduction of\ngravitinos [41]. However the dominant source of gravitino production in a thermal\nbath is scattering which include an on-shell gluon or gluino leg. However there exists\na natural solution to this problem and we showed that the final reheat temperature\nis actually well below Eq. (28), i.e. TR \u226a Tmax .\n\nOne comment is in order before closing this subsection. The gravitinos can\n\nalso be created non-perturbatively during inflaton oscillations, both of the helicity\n\u00b13/2 [42] and helicity \u00b11/2 states [43]. In models of high scale inflation (i.e. Hinf \u226b\nm3/2 ) helicity \u00b11/2 states can be produced very efficiently (and much more copiously\n\nthan helicity \u00b13/2 states). At the time of production these states mainly consist of\nthe inflatino (inflaton's superpartner). However these fermions also decay in the form\n\nof inflatino, which is coupled to matter with a strength which is equal to that of the\ninflaton. Therefore, they inevitably decay at a similar rate as that of inflaton, and\nhence pose no threat to primordial nucleosynthesis [44].\nIn the present case m\u03c6 \u223c m3/2 \u226b Hinf . Therefore low energy supersymmetry\n\nbreaking is dominant during inflation, and hence helicity \u00b11/2 states of the grav-\n\nitino are not related to the inflatino (which is a linear combination of leptons or\n9\n\nIn a favorable condition the flat direction VEV coupled very weakly to the flat direction inflaton\n\ncould also enhance the perturbative decay rate of the inflaton [38].\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fquarks)at any moment of time. As a result helicity \u00b11/2 and \u00b13/2 states are ex-\n\ncited equally, and their abundances are suppressed due to kinematical phase factor.\nMoreover there will be no dangerous gravitino production from perturbative decay\nof the inflaton quanta [39, 40, 45]. The reason is that the inflaton is not a gauge\nsinglet and has gauge strength couplings to other MSSM fields. This makes the\ninf laton \u2192 inf latino + gravitino decay mode totally irrelevant.\n\nLet us briefly discuss the cold dark matter issue. Note that our model of inflation\n\nis embedded within MSSM, it is a bonus that the cold dark matter candidate comes\nout quite naturally once we assume the R-parity. In a simple toy model like mSUGRA\nthere are only four parameters and one sign. These are m0 (the universal scalar soft\nbreaking mass at the GUT scale MG ); m1/2 (the universal gaugino soft breaking\nmass at MG ); A0 (the universal trilinear soft breaking mass at MG )\n\n10\n\n; tan \u03b2 =\n\nhH2 ihH1 i at the electroweak scale (where H2 gives rise to u quark masses and H1 to\n\nd quark and lepton masses); and the sign of \u03bc, the Higgs mixing parameter in the\n\nsuperpotential (W\u03bc = \u03bcH1 H2 ). Unification of gauge couplings within supersymmetry\nsuggests that MG \u2243 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV. The model parameters are already significantly\n\nconstrained by different experimental results. In subsequent plots we show that\nthere exists an interesting overlap between the constraints from inflation and the\nCDM abundance [10].\nWe show that the mSUGRA parameter space in figures 3, for tan \u03b2 = 10 and\n40 with the udd flat direction using \u03bb = 1\n\n11\n\n. In the figures, we show contours\n\ncorrespond to ns = 1 for the maximum value of \u03b4H = 2.03 \u00d7 10\u22125 (at 2\u03c3 level) and\nns = 1.0, 0.98, 0.96 for \u03b4H = 1.91 \u00d7 10\u22125. The constraints on the parameter space\n\narising from the inflation appearing to be consistent with the constraints arising from\nthe dark matter content of the universe and other experimental results. We find that\ntan \u03b2 needs to be smaller to allow for smaller values of ns < 1. It is also interesting to\nnote that the allowed region of m\u03c6 , as required by the inflation data for \u03bb = 1 lies in\nthe stau-neutralino coannihilation region which requires smaller values of the SUSY\nparticle masses. The SUSY particles in this parameter space are, therefore, within\nthe reach of the LHC very quickly. The detection of the region at the LHC has been\n10\n\nThe relationship between the two A terms, the trilinear, A0 and the non-renormalizable A term\n\nin Eq.(2) can be related to each other, however, that depends on the SUSY breaking sector. For a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nPolonyi model, they are given by: A = (3 \u2212 3)/(6 \u2212 3)A0 [7].\n11\nWe have a similar figure for the flat direction LLe which we do not show in this paper.

We also show\nthe the dark matter detection rate by vertical blue lines.\n\nconsidered in refs [46]. From the figures, one can also find that as tan \u03b2 increases,\nthe inflation data along with the dark matter, rare decay and Higgs mass constraint\nallow smaller ranges of m1/2 . For example, the allowed ranges of gluino masses are\n765 GeV-2.1 TeV and 900 GeV-1.7 TeV for tan \u03b2 = 10 and 40 respectively [10].\n\u22121\nSo far we have chosen \u03bb = 1. Now if \u03bb is small e.g., \u03bb <\n\u223c 10 , we find that the\nallowed values of m\u03c6 to be large. In this case the dark matter allowed region requires\n\nthe lightest neutralino to have larger Higgsino component in the mSUGRA model.\nAs we will see shortly, this small value of \u03bb is accommodated in SO(10) type model.\nIn figure 4, we show ns = 1, 0.98 contours for \u03b4H = 1.91 \u00d7 10\u22125 in the mSUGRA\n\nparameter space for tan \u03b2 = 10. In this figure, we find that ns can not smaller than\n0.97, but if we lower \u03bb which will demand larger m\u03c6 and therefore ns can be lowered\ndown to 0.92.\nIn the second panel of figure 4, we show the contours of \u03bb for different values\n\nof m\u03c6 which are allowed by ns and \u03b4H = 1.91 \u00d7 10\u22123 . The blue bands show the\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\f1\n\n4000\n\n0.98\nns=0.98, \u03b4h=1.91x10\n\n250\n\n\u03bb=0.1\n\n\u03bb=0.3\n\n\u03bb =1\n\n\u03bb=0.5\n\n0.96\n\n-10\n\n2\n\n0.94\n\u03bb=0.0\n\n1000\n\na\u03bc<11\u00d710\n\nmh\u2264114 GeV\n\nLEP\nII\n\n2000\n\n-5\n\nns\n\nm0[GeV]\n\n3000\n\nmq\u0303=1.75 TeV\n\n-5\n\nmg\u0303=2.1 TeV\n\nns=1, \u03b4h=1.91x10\n\nmg\u0303=765 GeV\n\nA0=0, \u03bc>0\ntan\u03b2=10\n\n500\n\n750\n\n1000\n\nm1/2[GeV]\n\n0.92\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nm\u03c6[GeV]\n\nFigure 4: The contours for different values of ns and \u03b4H are shown in the m0 \u2212 m1/2 plane\nfor tan \u03b2 = 10. We used \u03bb = 0.1 for the contours. We show the dark matter allowed region\n\nnarrow blue corridor, g-2 region (light blue) for a\u03bc \u2264 11 \u00d7 10\u22128 , Higgs mass \u2264 114 GeV\n\n(pink region) and LEPII bounds on SUSY masses (red). The black region is not allowed by\nradiative electroweak symmetry breaking. We use mt = 172.7 GeV for this graph. In the\n\nright hand side plot we show the contours of \u03bb for \u03b4H = 1.91 \u00d7 10\u22125 in the ns -m\u03c6 plane.\nThe blue band on the left is due to the stau-neutralino coannihilation region for tan \u03b2 = 10\n\nand the blue band on the right (which continues beyond the plotting range) denotes the\nfocus point region.\n\ndark matter allowed regions for tan \u03b2 = 10. The band on the left is due to the stauneutralino coannihilation region allowed by other constraints and the allowed values\nof \u03bb are 0.3-1. The first two generation squarks masses are 690 GeV and 1.9 TeV\nfor the minimum and maximum values of m\u03c6 allowed by the dark matter and other\nconstraints. The gluino masses for these are 765 GeV and 2.1 TeV respectively. The\nband is slightly curved due to the shifting of \u03c60 as a function \u03bb. (We solve for SUSY\nparameters from the inflaton mass at \u03c60 ). The band on the right which continues\nbeyond the plotting range of the figure ?? is due to the Higgsino dominated dark\nmatter. We find that \u03bb is mostly \u2264 0.1 in this region and m\u03c6 > 1.9 TeV. In this\n\ncase the squark masses are much larger than the gluino mass since m0 is much larger\nthan m1/2 .\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fThere have been other scintillating developments in embedding inflation, particularly, realizing saddle point inflation in particle physics. The flatness of the inflaton\npotential can be accounted for a weakness of the Dirac Yukawa couplings for the\nobserved neutrino mass spectrum [8, 13]. In Ref. [13], we provided an example where\npart of the inflaton flat direction acts as a thermal dark matter candidate while part\nof it decays into the SM baryons. The detection of dark matter and the neutrino properties in neutrino-less double beta decay experiments would shed important lights on\nthe inflaton origin.\nTo summarize, in near future it will be possible to unveil the origin of the inflaton\nin a terrestrial laboratory such as the LHC and the neutrino-less double beta decay\nexperiments. Recognizing the inflaton dressed with a SM gauge group will be the\nmost cherished success of an inflationary paradigm.\nThe research of A.M. is partly supported by the European Union through Marie\nCurie Research and Training Network \"UNIVERSENET\" (MRTN-CT-2006-035863).\n\nReferences\n[1] D.N.
