We prove also that if\nD is a tame semiramified division algebra of prime power degree pn over E such that p 6= char(\u0112)\nand rk(\u0393D /\u0393E ) \u2265 3 [resp., such that p 6= char(\u0112) and p3 divides exp(\u0393D /\u0393E )], then D is non-cyclic\n[Proposition 3.1] [resp., D is not an elementary abelian crossed product [Proposition 3.2]].\n\nIntroduction\nLet B be a tame central division algebra over a Henselian valued field E. We know\nby [JW90, Lemma 6.2] that B is similar to some S \u2297E T , where S is an inertially\nsplit [resp., T is a tame totally ramified] division algebra over E. By generalizing the\nmethod used by Tignol and Amitsur in [TA85], Morandi and Sethuraman determined\nin [MorSe95] necessary and sufficient conditions for B to have Kummer subfields\nwhen B = S \u2297E T . A good question was to see if we have the same results when\nB is an arbitrary tame central division algebra over E. To deal with this question,\nwe remarked that it will be the same if we can determine necessary and sufficient\nconditions for a graded central division algebra over a graded field to have Kummer\n\u2217 Mathematics\n\nsubject classification (MSC2000): 16K50, 16W50, 16W60 and 16W70.\nWords: Generalized crossed products, (Graded) Brauer group, Valued division algebras, Henselization,\nGraded division algebras, Kummer graded field extensions.\n\u2020 Key\n\n1\n\n\fgraded subfields. Indeed, we know that if char(\u0112) does not divide deg(B), then any\nresult concerning graded subfields of GB gives an analogous one for B.\nA first key idea was the fact that if D is a graded central division algebra over a\ngraded field F , then there is a factor set (\u03c9, f ) of \u0393D /\u0393F in D0 F such that D is the\ngeneralized graded crossed product (D0 F, \u0393D /\u0393F , (\u03c9, f )). Another important result\nconsists in the fact that f can be decompsed in a nice way. Indeed, we showed that for\nany \u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 \u2208 \u0393D /\u0393F , we can write f (\u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 ) = d(\u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 )h(\u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 ), where (\u03c9, d) is a factor set\nof \u0393D /\u0393F in D0 and h \u2208 Z 2 (\u0393D /\u0393F , F \u2217 )sym [Lemma 1.6]. We show also in section 2\nthat if K is a Kummer graded subfield of D, then there is an exact sequence of trivial\n\u0393K /\u0393F -modules \u03b1K : 1 \u2192 kum(K0 /F0 ) \u2192 kum(K/F ) \u2192 \u0393K /\u0393F \u2192 0. We consider\n\u03b1K as an element of Z 2 (\u0393D /\u0393F , kum(K0 /F0 ))sym and so applying the previous facts\nwe get in [Corollary 2.10 and Corollary 2.11] necessary and sufficient conditions for\nD to have Kummer graded subfields when F0 contains enough roots of unity. This\nresults are then applied to give necessary and sufficient conditions for a semiramified\ngraded division algebra D over a graded field F to be cyclic [resp., to be an elementary\nabelian graded crossed product] when F0 contains enough roots of unity. In section 3,\nand without assuming any root of unity to be in \u0112, we prove that if E is a Henselian\nvalued field and B is a tame semiramified division algebra of prime power degree pn\nover E such that p 6= char(\u0112) and rk(\u0393B /\u0393F ) \u2265 3 [resp., such that p 6= char(\u0112)\nand p3 divides exp(\u0393B /\u0393E )], then B is non-cyclic [Proposition 3.1] [resp., B is not an\nelementary abelian crossed product [Proposition 3.2]].\nThroughout this paper, we assume familiarity with the definitions and notations\npreviously used in [M05] and [M07].\n\n1\n\nGeneralized graded crossed products and graded division\nalgebras\n\n(1.1) Let L be a field and A a central simple algebra over L. We denote by A\u2217 the\ngroup of invertible elements of A and by Aut(A) the group of ring automorphisms\nof A. For any c \u2208 A\u2217 , we denote by Inn(c) the ring automorphism of A defined\n2\n\n\fby a 7\u2192 cac\u22121 . Let H be a finite group that acts by automorphisms on L and let\n\u03c9 : H \u2192 Aut(A) and f : H \u00d7 H \u2192 A\u2217 be two maps. We say that (\u03c9, f ) is a factor\nset of H in A if the following conditions are satisfied :\n(1) \u03c9\u03c3 (a) = \u03c3(a) for all a \u2208 L and \u03c3 \u2208 H,\n(2) \u03c9\u03c3 \u03c9\u03c4 = Inn(f (\u03c3, \u03c4 ))\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4 for all \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 H, and\n(3) f (\u03c3, \u03c4 )f (\u03c3\u03c4, \u03bc) = \u03c9\u03c3 (f (\u03c4, \u03bc))f (\u03c3, \u03c4 \u03bc) for all \u03c3, \u03c4, \u03bc \u2208 H.\nIf (\u03c9, f ) is a factor set of H in A, then we define the generalized crossed product\nassociated to (\u03c9, f ) to be the algebra (A, H, (\u03c9, f )) = \u2295\u03c3\u2208H Ax\u03c3 , where x\u03c3 are independent indeterminates over A satisfying the following multiplicative conditions (for\nall \u03c3 \u2208 H and a \u2208 A) :\n(4) x\u03c3 a = \u03c9\u03c3 (a)x\u03c3 , and\n(5) x\u03c3 x\u03c4 = f (\u03c3, \u03c4 )x\u03c3\u03c4 .\nIt is well-known that if char(L) does not divide card(H), then (A, H, (\u03c9, f )) is a\nsemisimple algebra (see [MorSe95, p. 556]).\nLet (\u03c9, f ) and (\u03c9 \u2032 , f \u2032 ) be two factor sets of H in A. We say that (\u03c9, f ) and (\u03c9 \u2032, f \u2032 )\nare cohomologous if there is a family (a\u03c3 )\u03c3\u2208H of elements of A\u2217 such that for all\n\u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 H, \u03c9\u03c3\u2032 = Inn(a\u03c3 )\u03c9\u03c3 and f \u2032 (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) = a\u03c3 \u03c9\u03c3 (a\u03c4 )f (\u03c3, \u03c4 )a\u22121\n\u03c3\u03c4 . We write in this case\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(\u03c9, f ) \u223c (\u03c9 , f ). The relation \u223c is an equivalence relation on the set of factor sets of\nH in A. We denote the set of equivalence classes by H(H, A\u2217 ). If A = L is a Galois\nfield extension of some field E and H = Gal(L/E), then H(H, A\u2217 ) is the second\nGalois cohomology group H 2 (H, L\u2217 ).\nNow, let L be a graded field, A a graded central simple algebra over L, H a finite\ngroup that acts on L by graded automorphisms (of grade 0), GAut(A)0 the group of\ngraded ring automorphisms (of grade 0) of A (i.e. ring automorphisms of A such that\nf (A\u03b4 ) = A\u03b4 ). In the same way as above, if \u03c9 : H \u2192 GAut(A)0 and f : H \u00d7 H \u2192 A\u2217\nare two maps that satisfy the conditions (1) to (3) above, then we say that (\u03c9, f ) is a\ngraded factor set of H in A. The corresponding graded generalized crossed product\n(A, H, (\u03c9, f )) is defined also as above. Namely, (A, H, (\u03c9, f )) = \u2295\u03c3\u2208H Ax\u03c3 , where\nx\u03c3 are independent indeterminates on A satisfying the multiplicative conditions :\nx\u03c3 a = \u03c9\u03c3 (a)x\u03c3 and x\u03c3 x\u03c4 = f (\u03c3, \u03c4 )x\u03c3\u03c4 for all a \u2208 A and \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 H. As we will see in\n3\n\n\fthe next lemma, (A, H, (\u03c9, f )) has a unique graded algebra structure extending that\nof A and for which x\u03c3 are homogeneous elements (the proof of this lemma is inspired\nfrom [HW(2), Lemma 5.4]).\nLemma 1. 2 Let L be a graded field, A be a graded central simple algebra over L, H\na finite group that acts on L by graded automorphisms, and (\u03c9, f ) a graded factor set\nof H in A. Then, there is a unique graded algebra structure of (A, H, (\u03c9, f )) extending\nthe grading of A and for which x\u03c3 are homogeneous elements.\nProof. Let \u0393A (a totally ordered abelian group) be the support of A, \u2206A (=\n\u0393A \u2297ZZ Q\n\u2032 ) be the divisible hull of \u0393A and consider the map h : H \u00d7 H \u2192 \u2206A ,\n(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) 7\u2192 gr(f (\u03c3, \u03c4 )). Then, it follows from condition (3) above that h is a cocycle of\nZ 2 (H, \u2206A ) (for the trivial action of H on \u2206A ). Since H is finite and \u2206A is uniquely\ndivisible, then H 2 (H, \u2206A ) = H 1 (H, \u2206A ) = 0. Therefore, there is a unique family\n(\u03b4\u03c3 )\u03c3\u2208H of elements of \u2206A such that h(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) = \u03b4\u03c3 + \u03b4\u03c4 \u2212 \u03b4\u03c3\u03c4 (the uniqueness follows\nfrom the fact that H 1 (H, \u2206A ) = 0). The unique graded structure of (A, H, (\u03c9, f ))\nthat extends that of A and for which x\u03c3 are homogeneous elements is then defined\nby gr(x\u03c3 ) = \u03b4\u03c3 .\nIn what follows, we will show that any graded division algebra can be represented\nas a generalized graded crossed product. This representation, will be applied in section 2 to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Kummer\ngraded subfields.\n(1.3) Let F be a graded field and D a graded central division algebra over F . Then,\nthe map \u03b8D : \u0393D /\u0393F \u2192 Gal(Z(D0 )/F0 ), defined by \u03b8D (gr(d) + \u0393F )(a) = dad\u22121 for\nany d \u2208 D \u2217 and a \u2208 Z(D0 ), is a surjective group homomorphism. Since HCq(D) is\na tame central division algebra over HF rac(F ), then by [JW90, Proposition 1.7 and\nDefinition p. 166] Z(D0 ) is an abelian field extension of F0 . For simplicity, we denote\nby G the Galois group Gal(Z(D0 )/F0 ). So, by [HW(1)99, Remark 3.1] Z(D0 )F is\nan abelian Galois graded field extension of F with Galois group isomorphic to G. In\nwhat follows, we will consider the action of \u0393D /\u0393F on Z(D0 )F defined by \u03b8D (i.e., for\n4\n\n\fany \u03b3\u0304 \u2208 \u0393D /\u0393F and any a \u2208 Z(D0 )F , we let \u03b3\u0304(a) = d\u03b3\u0304 ad\u03b3\u0304\u22121 , where d\u03b3\u0304 is an arbitrary\nhomogeneous element of D \u2217 such that gr(d\u03b3\u0304 ) + \u0393F = \u03b3\u0304).\nWe aim here to show that there is a graded factor set (\u03c9, f ) of H := \u0393D /\u0393F in D0 F\nsuch that D = (D0 F, H, (\u03c9, f )).

Hence, e\u2217 ([d\u2032 ]) = [\u03b1K ].\n\n(2.5) Let F be a graded field, D a graded division algebra over F , A a finite abelian\nsubgoup of D \u2217 /F \u2217 with exponent m, and for any a \u2208 A, let da be a representative of\na in D \u2217 . Assume that F0 contains a primitive mth root of unity and let F (A) = F [da\n| a \u2208 A] be the subring of D generated by F and the elements da (a \u2208 A). If da are\npairwise commuting, then as in the ungraded case F (A) is a Kummer graded field\nextension of F with kum(F (A)) = A (it suffices to see that F (A) is a graded field\nand that F rac(F (A)) = F rac(F )(A) when A is identified with its canonical image in\nCq(D)\u2217 /F rac(F )\u2217).\nConversely to Theorem 2.4, we have the following Theorem.\nTheorem 2. 6 Let F be a graded field, D a graded central division algebra over F\nand (\u03c9, d) the factor set of \u0393D /\u0393F in D0 seen in Lemma 1.7. Assume F0 contains\nenough roots of unity and that there are :\n1. a field extension M of F0 in D0 , and a subgroup R of \u0393D /\u0393F acting trivially on\nM,\n2. a cocycle d\u2032 \u2208 Z 2 (R, KUM(M/F0 ))sym and a map \u03c9 \u2032 : R \u2192 Aut(D0 ) such that\n\u0393 /\u0393\n(\u03c9 \u2032 , i\u2217 d\u2032 ) is a factor set of R in D0 cohomologous to resRD F (\u03c9, d) and such that\n9\n\n\f\u03c9\u03b3\u0304\u2032 (a) = a for all a \u2208 M and \u03b3\u0304 \u2208 R.\nThen, there exists a Kummer graded subfield K of D such that :\n1. K0 = M, \u0393K /\u0393F = R and\n2. e\u2217 ([d\u2032 ]) = [\u03b1K ].\nProof. Let's denote by H the quotient group \u0393D /\u0393F and write D = \u2295\u03b3\u0304\u2208H D0 F x\u03b3\u0304 ,\nwhere x\u03b3\u0304 a = \u03c9\u03b3\u0304 (a)x\u03b3\u0304 and x\u03b3\u0304 x\u03b3\u0304 \u2032 = d(\u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 )h(\u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 )x\u03b3\u0304+\u03b3\u0304 \u2032 (h being the cocycle of\nZ 2 (H, F \u2217 )sym seen in Lemma 1.7). The fact that (\u03c9 \u2032, i\u2217 d\u2032 ) is cohomologous to resH\nR (\u03c9, d)\n\u2217\nmeans that there is a family (b\u03b3\u0304 )\u03b3\u0304\u2208R of elements of D0 such that for all a \u2208 D0\nand \u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 \u2208 R, we have \u03c9\u03b3\u0304\u2032 (a) = b\u03b3\u0304 \u03c9\u03b3\u0304 (a)b\u22121\nand d\u2032 (\u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 ) = b\u03b3\u0304 \u03c9\u03b3\u0304 (b\u03b3\u0304 \u2032 )d(\u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 )b\u22121\n\u03b3\u0304\n\u03b3\u0304+\u03b3\u0304 \u2032 .\nLet y\u03b3\u0304 = b\u03b3\u0304 x\u03b3\u0304 for all \u03b3\u0304 \u2208 R. Then, we have y\u03b3\u0304 y\u03b3\u0304 \u2032 = d\u2032 (\u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 )h(\u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 )y\u03b3\u0304+\u03b3\u0304 \u2032 . Let\nK = \u2295\u03b3\u0304\u2208R MF y\u03b3\u0304 (\u2286 D). Since d\u2032 and h are symmetric, then y\u03b3\u0304 are pairwise commuting. Moreover, by hypotheses \u03c9\u03b3\u0304\u2032 (a) = a for all a \u2208 M and \u03b3\u0304 \u2208 R, so K is a\ncommutative graded subring (hence a graded subfield) of D.\nLet A be the subgroup of D \u2217 /F \u2217 generated by kum(M/F0 ) and the set {\u0233\u03b3\u0304 }\u03b3\u0304\u2208R .\nOne can easily see that up to a graded isomorphism we have K = F (A). Therefore, K is a Kummer graded field extension of F with kum(K/F ) = A. Considering\nclasses in kum(K/F ), we have \u0233\u03b3\u0304 \u0233\u03b3\u0304 \u2032 = e(d\u2032 (\u03b3\u0304, \u03b3\u0304 \u2032 ))\u0233\u03b3\u0304+\u03b3\u0304 \u2032 , where e : KUM(M/F0 ) \u2192\nkum(M/F0 ) is the canonical surjective homomorphism (we identify here kum(M/F0 )\nwith its canonical image in kum(K/F )), so kum(K/F ) is the extension of kum(M/F0 )\nby R with cocycle e\u2217 ([d\u2032 ]).\n(2.7) Let F be a graded field, D a semiramified graded division algebra over F\nand G = Gal(D0 /F0 ). We know that \u0393D /\u0393F \u223c\n= G. Therefore, any subgroup of\n\u0393D /\u0393F can be identified to a subgoup of G. Let's consider the following diagram :\ni\n\n\u2217\nH 2 (\u0393K /\u0393F , D0\u2217 )\nH 2 (\u0393K /\u0393F , KUM(K0 /F0 ))sym \u2192\ne\u2217 \u2193\n\u2191 resG\n\u0393K /\u0393F\n2\n2\nH (\u0393K /\u0393F , kum(K0 /F0 ))sym\nH (G, D0\u2217 )\n\nwhere i\u2217 is the homomorphism of cohomology groups induced by the inclusion map\ni\nKUM(K0 /F0 ) \u2192 D0\u2217 , e\u2217 is the homomorphism of cohomology groups induced by the\ncanonical surjective homomorphism e : KUM(K0 /F0 ) \u2192 kum(K0 /F0 ), and resG\n\u0393K /\u0393F\n10\n\n\fis the restriction map. As a consequence of Theorem 2.4, we have the following\nCorollary :\nCorollary 2. 8 Let F be a graded field, D a semiramified graded division algebra over\nF , G = Gal(D0 /F0 ), d the cocycle of Z 2 (G, D0\u2217 ) seen in Remark 1.8, K a Kummer\ngraded subfield of D and \u03b1K the cocycle of Z 2 (\u0393K /\u0393F , kum(K0 /F0 ))sym defined in\n(2.1), then there exists a cocycle d\u2032 \u2208 Z 2 (\u0393K /\u0393F , KUM(K0 /F0 ))sym such that :\n(1) i\u2217 ([d\u2032 ]) = resG\n\u0393K /\u0393F ([d]), and\n\u2032\n(2) e\u2217 ([d ]) = [\u03b1K ].\nAlso, as a consequence of Theorem 2.6, we have the following Corollary.\nCorollary 2. 9 Let F be a graded field, D a semiramified graded division algebra over\nF and d \u2208 Z 2 (G, D0\u2217 ) the cocycles seen in Remark 1.8. Assume F0 contains enough\nroots of unity and suppose there exist : a subfield M of D0 containing F0 , a subgroup\nR of \u0393D /\u0393F acting trivially on M, and a cocycle d\u2032 \u2208 Z 2 (G, KUM(M/F0 ))sym such\nthat i\u2217 ([d\u2032 ]) = resG\nR ([d]). Then, there exists a Kummer graded subfield K of D such\nthat :\n(1) M = K0 , R = \u0393K /\u0393F , and\n(2) [\u03b1K ] = e\u2217 ([d\u2032 ]).\n(2.10) Now let E be a Henselian valued field and D a tame central division algebra\nover E such that char(\u0112) does not divide deg(D). Since GD is a graded central\ndivision algebra over GE, then we can define a graded factor set (\u03c9, d) corresponding\nto GD as made in Lemma 1.7. If K is a Kummer subfield of D, then by [HW(1),\nTheorem 5.2] GK is a Kummer graded subfield of GD. So, we can consider the\nsymmetric cocycle \u03b1GK of (2.1) corresponding to GK. For simplicity, we denote \u03b1GK\njust by \u03b1K . As a direct consequence of Theorem 2.4, we have the following Corollary\nCorollary 2. 11 Let E be a Henselian valued field and D a tame central division algebra over E such that char(\u0112) does not divide deg(D). Using the notations of (2.10),\nif K is a Kummer subfield of D, then there is a cocycle d\u2032 \u2208 Z 2 (\u0393K /\u0393E , KUM(K\u0304/\u0112))sym\n11\n\n\f(for the trivial action of \u0393K /\u0393E on KUM(K\u0304/\u0112)) and a map \u03c9 \u2032 : \u0393K /\u0393E \u2192 Aut(D\u0304)\nwhich satisfies \u03c9\u03b3\u0304\u2032 (a) = a for all a \u2208 K\u0304 and \u03b3\u0304 \u2208 \u0393K /\u0393E , such that :\n\u0393D /\u0393E\n1. (\u03c9 \u2032, i\u2217 d\u2032 ) is a factor set of \u0393K /\u0393E in D\u0304 cohomologous to res\u0393K\n/\u0393E (\u03c9, d), and\n\u2032\n2. e\u2217 ([d ]) = [\u03b1K ].\nAlso, as a consequence of Theorem 2.6, we have the following Corollary :\nCorollary 2. 12 Let E be a Henselian valued field and D a tame central division\nalgebra over E such that char(\u0112) does not divide deg(D). Assume that \u0112 contains\nenough roots of unity and that (with the notations of (2.10)), there are :\n1. a field extension M of \u0112 in D\u0304, and a subgroup R of \u0393D /\u0393E acting trivially on M,\n2. a cocycle d\u2032 \u2208 Z 2 (R, KUM(M/\u0112))sym and a map \u03c9 \u2032 : R \u2192 Aut(D\u0304) such that\n\u0393D/\u0393E\n(\u03c9 \u2032 , i\u2217 d) is a factor set of R in D\u0304 cohomologous to resR\n(\u03c9, d) and such that\n\u2032\n\u03c9\u03b3\u0304 (a) = a for all a \u2208 M and \u03b3\u0304 \u2208 R.\nThen, there exists a Kummer subfield K of D such that :\n1. K\u0304 = M, \u0393K /\u0393E = R and\n2. e\u2217 ([d\u2032 ]) = [\u03b1K ].\nRemark 2.13 (1) In the last two corollaries, we can use the group isomorphism\nkum(K/E) \u223c\n= kum(GK/GE) and replace the exact sequence of trivial \u0393K /\u0393E modules \u03b1GK by another exact sequence of trivial \u0393K /\u0393E -modules\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c8\n\n1 \u2192 kum(K\u0304/\u0112) \u2192 kum(K/E) \u2192 \u0393K /\u0393E \u2192 0\nthen use it to have necessary and sufficient condition for D to have Kummer subfields.\n(2) We have also analogous results to Corollary 2.8 and Corollary 2.9 for tame semiramified division algebras over Henselian valued fields.\n(3) We can drop the assumption that E is Henselian in many results of this paper.\nIndeed, let D be a valued central division algebra over a field E, HE be the Henselization of D with respect to the restriction of the valuation of D and HD = D \u2297E HE.\nThen, one can easily see that GD = G(HD) and GE = G(HE).\nTheorem 2. 14 Let F be a graded field, D a semiramified graded division algebra\nover F and d the cocycle seen in Remark 1.8. If F0 contains a primitive deg(D)th\n12\n\n\froot of unity, then the following statements are equivalent :\n(1) D is cyclic,\n(2) There is a field extension M of F0 in D0 such that :\n(i) the extensions M/F0 and D0 /M are cyclic, and\n(ii) (D0 /F0 , G, d) \u2297F0 M \u223c (D0 /M, \u03c3, u) for some generator \u03c3 of Gal(D0 /M) and\nsome u \u2208 M \u2217 such that uF0\u2217 generates kum(M/F0 ).\nProof. This can be proved in the same way as [T86, Theorem 3.1].\nTheorem 2. 15 Let F be a graded field, D a semiramified graded division algebra\nover F and d the cocycle seen in Remark 1.8. Suppose now that deg(D) is a power\nof a prime p and that F0 contains a primitive pth root of unity. Then, the following\nstatements are equivalent\n(1) D is an elementary abelian graded crossed product,\n(2) there is a field extension M of F0 in D0 such that M/F0 and D0 /M are elementary abelian, and (D0 /F0 , G, d) represents in Br(D0 /F0 )/Dec(D0 /F0 ) an element of the image of the canonical group homomorphism Br(M/F0 )/Dec(M/F0 ) \u2192\nBr(D0 /F0 )/Dec(D0 /F0 ),\n(3) exp(G) = p or p2 and (D0 /F0 , G, d) represents in Br(D0 /F0 )/Dec(D0 /F0 ) an\nelement of the image of the canonical group homomorphism Br(L/F0 )/Dec(L/F0 ) \u2192\nBr(D0 /F0 )/Dec(D0 /F0 ), where L = F ixGp (D0 ) (Gp being the subgoup of G consisting in p-powers of elements of G) (this last condition is void if exp(G) = p since in\nthis case L = K.)\nProof. This can be proved in the same way as [T86, Theorem 4.1].\nProposition 2. 16 Let E be a Henselian valued field, D a division algebra over E\nsuch that char(\u0112) does not divide deg(D) and H a finite group. Then, D has a tame\nGalois subfield with Galois group isomorphic to H if and only if GD has a Galois\ngraded subfield of Galois group isomorphic to H. Therefore, D is cyclic [resp., an\nelementary abelian crossed product] if and only if GD is cyclic [resp., an elementary\nabelian graded crossed product].\n13\n\n\fProof. Assume that D has a Galois subfield of Galois group isomorphic to H, then\nby [HW(1), Theorem 5.2] GK is a Galois graded subfield of GD with Galois group\nisomorphic to H. Conversely, assume that GD has a Galois graded subfield L with\nGalois group isomorphic to H. Then, again by [HW(1), Theorem 5.2] there is a tame\nfield extension M of E such that GM \u223c\n= L and Gal(M/E) \u223c\n= H. By [HW(2)99,\nTheorem 5.9] M is isomorphic to a subfield of D.\nRemark. We recall that if E is a Henselian valued field and D is an inertially\nsplit division algebra over E with D\u0304 commutative, then D is a tame semiramified\ndivision algebra over E (see [M07, Proposition 2.6]). The reader can then see that\nsimilar results to Theorem 2.14, Theorem 2.15 in the case of tame semiramified division algebras over a Henselian valued field were proved in [MorSe95]. Using Theorem\n2.14, Theorem 2.15, we get the next two Corollaries of [MorSe95]. In the next section,\nwe will prove these two corollaries without assuming that \u0112 contains primitive roots\nof unity.\nCorollary 2. 17 [MorSe95, Corollary 5.5] Let E be a Henselian valued field and D\na tame semiramified division algebra of prime power degree over E. Suppose that\nchar(\u0112) does not divide deg(D) and \u0112 contains a primitive deg(D)th root of unity\nand that rk(\u0393D /\u0393E ) \u2265 3, then D is non-cyclic.\nProof. We have rk(Gal(GD0 /GE0 )) = rk(Gal(D\u0304/\u0112)) = rk(\u0393D /\u0393E ) \u2265 3. So by\nTheorem 2.14(2(i)) GD is non-cyclic. Hence, by Proposition 2.16, D is non-cyclic.\nCorollary 2. 18 [MorSe95, Corollary 5.7] Let E be a Henselian valued field and D a\ntame semiramified division algebra of prime power degree pn over E (p being a prime\ninteger and n \u2208 IN \u2217 ). Suppose that \u0112 contains a primitive pth root of unity and that\np3 divides exp(\u0393D /\u0393E ), then D has no elementary abelian maximal subfield.\nProof. This follows by Theorem 2.15 and Proposition 2.16.\n\n14\n\n\f3\n\nNon-cyclic and non-elementary abelian crossed product\ntame semiramified division algebras\n\nLet E be a Henselian valued field and D a tame semiramified division algebra of\nprime power degree pn over a Henselian valued field E such that char(\u0112) 6= p. In\nthis section, we aim to show that if rk(\u0393D /\u0393E ) \u2265 3, then D is non-cyclic [Proposition\n3.1], and that if p3 divides exp(\u0393D /\u0393F ), then D has no elementary abelian maximal\nsubfield [Proposition 3.2].\nProposition 3. 1 Let E be a Henselian valued field and D a semiramified division\nalgebra of degree n over E. Assume char(\u0112) does not divide n and suppose K is a\ncyclic maximal subfield of D. Then, \u0393K /\u0393E and \u0393D /\u0393K are cyclic. So, \u0393D /\u0393E is\ngenerated by two elements. In particular, if n is a prime power and rk(\u0393D /\u0393E ) \u2265 3,\nthen D is non-cyclic.\nProof. Let M be the inertial lift of K\u0304 over E in K (see [JW90, Theorem 2.8 and\nTheorem 2.9]). Since K is cyclic and totally ramified over M, then \u0393K /\u0393E (= \u0393K /\u0393M )\nis cyclic. Furthermore, we have \u0393D /\u0393K \u223c\n=\n= Gal(D\u0304/\u0112)/Gal(D\u0304/K\u0304) \u223c\n= (\u0393D /\u0393E )/(\u0393K /\u0393E ) \u223c\n\u223c\nGal(K\u0304/\u0112) = Gal(M/E) (for the second equivalence, see that K is a totally ramified\nM\nmaximal subfield of the semiramified division algebra CD\n). So, \u0393D /\u0393K is cyclic. Let\n\u03b31 + \u0393E be a generator of \u0393K /\u0393E and \u03b32 + \u0393K a generator of \u0393D /\u0393K , then for any\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u0393D /\u0393E , there are positive integers n1 and n2 such that \u03b1 = n1 \u03b31 + n2 \u03b32 + \u0393E . If\nn is a prime power, then rk(\u0393D /\u0393E ) \u2264 2.\nProposition 3. 2 Let E be a Henselian valued field and D a tame semiramified\ndivision algebra of prime power degree pn over E (p being a prime integer and n \u2208\nIN \u2217 ). If char(\u0112) 6= p and p3 divides exp(Gal(D\u0304/\u0112)), then D has no elementary\nabelian maximal subfield.\nProof. Suppose that K is an elementary abelian maximal subfield of D, then K\u0304/\u0112\nis elementary abelian. Therefore, for any \u03c3 \u2208 Gal(D\u0304/\u0112), \u03c3 p \u2208 Gal(D\u0304/K\u0304). Let M be\nthe inertial lift of K\u0304 over E in K. Then, K is a Galois totally ramified field extension\n15\n\n\fM\nis tame semiramified, then\nof M and Gal(K/M) \u223c\n= \u0393K /\u0393M . Moreover, since CD\n2\nGal(D\u0304/K\u0304) = Gal(D\u0304/M\u0304 ) \u223c\n= \u0393K /\u0393M (\u223c\n= Gal(K/M)). Hence, \u03c3 p = idD\u0304 . A contradiction.\n\nRemark 3.3 (1) We recall that we saw in [M07, Proposition 4.6] that if E is a\nHenselian valued field and D is a nondegenerate tame semiramified division algebra\nof prime power degree over E, then D has an elementary abelian maximal subfield if\nand only if \u0393D /\u0393F is elementary abelian.\n(2) As showed in [T86] with Malcev-Neumann division algebras, one can use Proposition 3.1 and Proposition 3.2 to prove the following result : Let m and n be integers\nwhich have the same prime factors and such that m divides n, and let k be an infinite field. If there is a prime p 6= char(k) such that p2 divides m and p3 divides n,\nthen Saltman's universal division algebras of exponent m and degree n over k are not\ncrossed products.\n\nReferences\n[BM00] M.
