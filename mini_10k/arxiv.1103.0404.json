In the case of a gas, the specific features of the breakdown waves are\ndetermined by the type of the gas, the value of the pressure, the geometry of the discharge cell\nand the value and variation rate of the voltage at the electrodes. The geometry determines\nthe space distribution of the electric field and hence the dynamics of the ionization fronts.\nIn the case where there in no initial ionization in the discharge gap, the ionization wave\nmay originate from one or several overlapping electron avalanches. After attenuation of the\nelectric field in the avalanche body, a conducting channel or streamer develops: a plasma\nregion fully ionized with a positive side expanding towards the cathode and a negative region\ntowards the anode.\nOne of the approaches used to model the development of the avalanche-streamer transition\nand the streamer propagation is a nonlinear system of balance equations with a diffusiondrift approximation for the currents, together with Poisson equation [1]. Some progress in\nthe understanding of the propagation mechanism has been achieved using that model. We\ncan mention: the study of stationary plane ionization waves [2, 3], self-similar solutions for\nionization waves in cylindrical and spherical geometries [4, 5], the effect of photoionization\n[6] and a branching mechanism as the result of the instability of planar ionization fronts\n[7\u20139]. In this hydrodynamic approximation, the fronts are subject to both stabilizing forces\ndue to diffusion which tend to dampen out any disturbances, and destabilizing forces due\nto electric field which promote them. The solution of the model, even in the simplest cases,\nposes a challenging problem both numerical and analytical. Early numerical simulations can\nbe found in [10, 11]. Recently, a contour dynamics model have been deduced in the limit of\nsmall electron diffusion [12], which resembles the Taylor-Melcher leaky dielectric model for\nelectrolyte solutions [13], but adapted to the context of electric (plasma) discharges. This\ncontour dynamics model allows to study more general situations in two-dimensional and\nthree-dimensional cases.\nThe contour dynamics model consists of an interface separating a plasma region from a\nneutral gas region as it is shown in Fig. 1. The separating surface has a net charge \u03c3 and the\n\u221a\nthickness goes to zero as D being D the charge diffusion coefficient. The case displayed\nin the figure correspond a negative discharge, so the electric field is pointing towards the\n2\n\n\fE+\nGas\n\nPlasma\nE_\n\u03c3\n\nD\nvN\n\nFIG. 1. The schematic of the contour dynamics model. The case displayed corresponds to a\nnegative streamer discharge discharge so \u03c3 represents the negative surface charge density. The\nelectric field points towards the plasma region in this case.\n\nplasma region and \u03c3 is the negative charge density at the surface. The front will evolve\nfollowing the equation\nvN =\n\n\u2212\u03bce E+\n\u03bd\n\n+2\n\ns\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nDe\nE0\n+\n\u03bce |E\u03bd | exp \u2212 + \u2212 De \u03ba,\nl0\n|E\u03bd |\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E+\n\u03bd is the normal component of the electric field at the interface when approaching\nit from outside the plasma region, \u03bce the eletron mobility, De is the electron diffusion\ncoefficient, E0 is a characteristic ionization electric field and \u03ba the curvature of the interface.\nThe parameter l0 is the microscopic ionization characteristic length. At the interface, the\ntotal negative surface charge density will change according to\n\u2202\u03c3\nE\u2212\n+ \u03bavN \u03c3 = \u2212 \u03bd \u2212 j\u03bd\u2212 ,\n\u2202t\n\u033ae\n\n(2)\n\nbeing now E\u2212\n\u03bd the electric field at the interface coming from inside the plasma, \u033ae is a\nparameter proportional to the resistivity of the electrons in the created plasma and j\u03bd\u2212 the\ncurrent contribution of any electromotive force if present.\nAlthough the equations (1) and (2) are written for the case of a negative front plotted in\nFig. 1, and we will present the derivation of the model for this case, we could use in principle\nthe same model for a positive front, but the electric field should be sign reversed, and \u03c3 would\nrepresent the positive surface charge density. Although the moving carriers in the model are\n3\n\n\fthe electrons, one may think of a front made of holes, with a positive surface charge density,\nand characterized with the corresponding parameters for the mobility, diffusion and so on.\nIn this paper, using the contour dynamics model, we will study cylindrical discharges\nwhen the plasma has finite conductivity. The dispersion curve for transversal instabilities\nwill be obtained for these finite conductivity streamers. The results will be compared with\nthe limiting cases of perfect conductivity, which is the Lozansky-Firsov model [14] with a\ncorrection due to electron diffusion, and with the case of a perfect insulator, i.e the limit\nof very small conductivity. Finally, we compare the results with an actual experiment for a\npositive streamer discharge.\nWe start by introducing the model. Taking a minimal set of balance equations to describe\nin fully a deterministic manner the discharge (see for example [7]), we will derive the contour\ndynamics equations for the evolution of the interface between the plasma region and the gas\nregion free of charge (or with a very small density of charge). The outline of this derivation\nhas already been reported [12] but here we present it in full details. Then, we proceed\nby studying a cylindrical discharge in the case of finite conductivity, and the analytical\nlimits of infinite resistivity and ideal conductivity. With the model at hand we will predict\nsome features of the stability of the fronts. Numerical simulations are made to calculate\nthe dispersion curves and test some of the analytical predictions. We briefly describe the\nnumerical methods employed in the corresponding section. We end with an analysis of\nthe results, the comparison with an experiment for a positive 2-D streamer discharge, and\noverview of possibilities that the model opens for more complicated geometries and fully 3D\ncases.\n\nII.\n\nTHE DYNAMICAL CONTOUR MODEL\n\nIn this section we obtain our model as a limit of a set of balance equations describing a\nstreamer discharge. We will first recall the minimal description of a streamer discharge and\nsome of the properties of the traveling planar fronts, and then make use of the asymptotic\nbehaviour of those planar fronts in the limit of small diffusion to give a correction to the\nvelocity of propagation of curved fronts. After finding the dynamics of the effective interface,\na balance of the charge transport along the interface will be provided in order to complete\nthe model.\n4\n\n\fA.\n\nThe minimal model\n\nFor simulating the dynamical streamer development of streamers out of a macroscopic\ninitial ionization seed, in a non-attaching gas like argon or nitrogen, the model of a streamer\ndischarge [15] can be simplified. As a first approach, the processes with the smaller probabilities or cross sections can be ignored. Attachment and recombination processes can be\nneglected on that basis in comparison with the ionization process for non-attaching gases.\nWe also ignore photoionization processes in this work. With these considerations in mind,\nthe resulting balance equations are\n\u2202Ne\n= \u2207 * (\u03bce Ne E + De \u2207Ne ) + \u03bdi Ne ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202Np\n= \u03bdi Ne ,\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere Ne is the electron density, Np is the positive ion density, \u03bce is the electron mobility\nand De the diffusion coefficient. The ionization coefficient \u03bdi can be modeled following the\nphenomenological approximation suggested by Townsend, which leads to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE0\n\u22121\n\u03bdi = \u03bce l0 |E| exp \u2212\n,\n|E|\n\n(5)\n\nwhere l0 is the ionization length, and E0 is the characteristic impact ionization electric field.\nThe fitting of experimental data can be done using those parameters [16]. Note also that it\nis assumed the positive ions do not move and \u03bce E is the drift velocity of electrons. Those\nare valid approximations at the initial stages of the streamers development, but it may not\nbe right afterward. To close the model, we consider Gauss's law\n\u2207*E =\n\ne(Np \u2212 Ne )\n.\n\u03b50\n\n(6)\n\nFor convenience the equations are reduced to dimensionless form. Townsend approximation provides physical scales and intrinsic parameters of the model if only impact ionization\nis present in the gas [3]. The units are given by the ionization length l0 , the characteristic impact ionization field E0 , and the electron mobility \u03bce . The velocity scale yields\nU0 = \u03bce E0 , and the time scale \u03c40 = l0 /U0 . Typical values of these quantities for nitrogen\nat normal conditions are l0 \u2248 2.3 \u03bcm, E0 \u2248 200 kV/m, and \u03bce \u2248 380 cm2 /Vs. We introduce the dimensionless variables rd = r/l0 , td = t/\u03c40 , the dimensionless field Ed = E/E0 ,\nthe dimensionless electron and positive ion densities ne = Ne /N0 and np = Np /N0 with\n5\n\n\fN0 = \u03b50 E0 /(el0 ), and the dimensionless diffusion constant D = De /(l0 U0 ). From now on, all\nthe quantites will be dimensionless unless othewise stated. Note however that we will not\nwrite the subindex d. Just for reference, the dimensionless model reads\n\u2202ne\n= \u2207 * (ne E + D \u2207ne ) + ne \u03b1(|E|),\n\u2202t\n\u2202np\n= ne \u03b1(|E|),\n\u2202t\n\u2207 * E = np \u2212 ne ,\n\u03b1(|E|) = |E| exp(\u22121/|E|),\nB.\n\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n\nPlanar fronts and boundary layer\n\nUsing the minimal streamer model, we can compute traveling wave solutions in the planar\ncase. We will assume that the plasma region is on the left and the front is moving toward the\nright. The traveling waves are solutions such as ne and np decay exponentially at infinity.\nThis means that we can take\nne = Ae\u2212\u03bb(x\u2212vt) ,\nnp = Be\u2212\u03bb(x\u2212vt) ,\nE = (E+ + Ce\u2212\u03bb(x\u2212vt) ) x\u0302,\nasymptotically far ahead for the planar wave in the x\u0302 direction, being E+ the value of the\nelectric field at the infinity. Introducing these expressions into the minimal model equations\nwe get the relation\nD\u03bb2 \u2212 (E+ + v)\u03bb + \u03b1(|E+ |) = 0,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich has real solutions if and only if\nq\nv \u2265 \u2212E + 2 D\u03b1(|E+ |).\n+\n\n(12)\n\np\n\u2217\nAll initial data decaying at infinity faster than Ae\u2212\u03bb x , with \u03bb\u2217 = 1/ D\u03b1(|E+ |), will develop\np\ntraveling waves with velocity v \u2217 = \u2212E+ + 2 D\u03b1(|E+ |). Clearly, from the assumption that\nthe plasma state is on the left, negative velocity solutions are unphysical. So in the case of\na negative front, when E+ is negative, the front will move at least with the drift velocity in\nthe case that D = 0. For positive fronts, the motion will be possible only if the creation of\n6\n\n\fcharge, given by the Townsend factor, and its diffusion can compensate the drift. A detailed\ndiscussion about the propagation mechanism can be found at [3].\nIf D \u226a 1 the profiles for np and E will vary very little from the profiles with D = 0 and\n\u221a\nne will develop a boundary layer at the front. This boundary layer has a width of O( D)\nas shown in Fig. 2. The main results for the structure of the boundary layer which we are\ngoing to make use are\nne = f (\u03c7),\n\u221a Z\nnp = \u2212 D\n\n(13)\n\u221e\n\nf (z) dz,\n\n(14)\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u221a\nE = E+ + O( D),\n\n(15)\n\n\u221a\nwith \u03c7 = (x \u2212 v \u2217 t)/ D, and E the electric field in the x\u0302 direction. The function f (\u03c7), also\nappearing in (14), is the solution of the equation\nq\n\u22022f\n\u2202f\n+ 2 \u03b1(|E+ |)\n= f (f \u2212 1),\n2\n\u2202\u03c7\n\u2202\u03c7\n\n(16)\n\nwhich becomes the solution of a Fisher equation under the additional assumptions that\nthe Townsend factor \u03b1(|E|) \u2248 1. So, as it is plotted in Fig. 2, the function f changes\n\u221a\nfrom constant values in a region of width D, when imposing the two maching conditions\nf (\u2212\u221e) = 1 and f (\u221e) = 0, thus separating the plasma region from the gas. The complete\nmathematical details can be found in [8] and [9].\n\nC.\n\nThe correction due to the curvature\n\nNext we will add the correction to the propagation velocity due to the curvature of the\nfront. We take a level surface of ne representing the interface, and introduce local coordinates\n\u03c4 (along the level surfaces of ne ) and \u03bd (orthogonal to the level surfaces of ne ).

Derivation of the contour dynamics model. We take a surface of constant ne at the\n\u221a\nboundary which has an effective width of order D. The local coordinates tangent and normal to\nthe surface, \u03c4 and \u03bd, together with a pillbox are also shown schematically.\n\nin [19]). We write (7) in local coordinates, and using (9), we find\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u2202ne\n\u2202ne\nE\u03bd\n\u2202ne\n\u2212 E\u03c4\n\u2212 \u221a + D\u03ba\n=\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202\u03c7\nD\n\u2202 2 ne\n+ ne \u03b1(|E|) + ne (np \u2212 ne ) + O(D).\n=\n\u2202\u03c72\nFinally we use (16) so that\n\u2202ne\n\u2202ne\n\u2212 E\u03c4\n\u2212\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\np\n\u221a\n1\nE\u03bd\n\u2202ne\n\u221a \u2212 2 \u03b1(|E\u03bd |) + D\u03ba\n= O(D 2 ).\n\u2202\u03c7\nD\n\n(17)\n1\n\nNote that the curvature term correction will be relevant provided 1 \u226a \u03ba \u226a D \u2212 2 . Thus we\nhave obtained a transport equation for the electron density with velocity\np\nv = \u2212E + (2 D\u03b1(|E|) \u2212 D\u03ba)n,\n\n(18)\n\np\nvN = \u2212E\u03bd + 2 D\u03b1(|E|) \u2212 D\u03ba.\n\n(19)\n\nThe level line ne which we have taken as representative of the interface evolution will move\nwith a normal velocity\n\nNotice that the level lines concentrate in a small region where ne presents a jump from\nits bulk value to zero, so most level lines follow (19). The tangential component of the\nvelocity will not change the geometry of the interface during its evolution, although tangential exchanges of charge affect the evolution through the dependence of vN on E\u03bd . The\nmathematical description of this effect will be the subject of next section.\n8\n\n\fD.\n\nCharge transport along the interface\n\nIn order to describe the charge transport along the interface we trace a small \"pillbox\"\nD around a portion of the interface having the top and bottom areas bigger than the lateral\narea, i.e. \u2206\u03c4 \u226b \u2206\u03bd as we can see in Fig. 2. On the other hand D will be big enough to\ncontain the diffusive layer and so the portion where the total negative charge density ne \u2212 np\nhas significant values different of zero.\nWe subtract (7) from (8) and integrate over the pillbox volume D, assume that ne \u2192 0\n\u221a\nfor \u03c7 = \u03bd/ D \u226b 1, |\u2207ne | \u2192 0 for |\u03c7| \u226b 1 and get\nZ\n1\n\u2202\n2\n(ne \u2212 np ) dV = ne E\u03bd \u2206\u03c4 |\u221e\n(20)\n\u03c7=\u2212\u221e + O(D ),\n\u2202t D\nwhere the contributions of the lateral transport of charge through the lateral surface is\nneglected in comparison with the exchange of charge in the normal direction. Note that in\nthe Taylor-Melcher model this assumption is also made. As explained in [12] the left hand\nside of equation (20) can be written as the time partial derivative of the product of the\nnegative surface charge density \u03c3 times the normal area \u2206\u03c4 , and the change of a surface\nelement can be related to the curvature times the normal velocity, so that\n\u2202\u03c3\n+ \u03bavN \u03c3 = \u2212 ne E\u03bd |\u03c7=\u2212\u221e\n\u2202t\n\n(21)\n\nIf a charge source I(t) is present in the plasma, for instance at x0 , this source will create\na current density inside the plasma and we will have at the interior of \u03a9\n\u2207 * j = I(t)\u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ).\n\n(22)\n\nBy adding this contribution to (21) we can finally write\n\u2202\u03c3\nE\u2212\n+ \u03bavN \u03c3 = \u2212 \u03bd \u2212 j\u03bd\u2212 ,\n\u2202t\n\u033a\n\n(23)\n\nwhere j\u03bd\u2212 is the current density coming from the ionized region \u03a9 to its boundary \u2202\u03a9 in the\nnormal direction \u03bd, E\u2212\n\u03bd is the normal component of the electric field when approaching the\ninterface from inside, and \u033a\u22121 = lim\u03c7=\u2212\u221e ne is the effective movility of the electrons inside\nthe plasma. Note that the quasineutrality of the plasma, further away of the interface is not\nchanged by the current, but there is a jump in the normal component of the electric field\nacross the interface given by\n\u2212\nE+\n\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bd = \u2212\u03c3,\n\n9\n\n(24)\n\n\fwith E+\n\u03bd the normal component of the electric field when approaching the interface from\noutside the plasma region.\n\nE.\n\nThe effective contour model\n\nThe Eqs. (19) and (23) together constitute the dynamical model able to describe the\nevolution of an interface separating a plasma region from a neutral region. Notice that\nin the case \u033a\u22121 \u226b 1, we arrive to Lozansky-Firsov model [14] with a correction due to\nelectron diffusion, meanwhile in the limit D = 0 we arrive at the classical Hele-Shaw model.\nSuch a model is known to possess solutions that develop singularities in the form of cusps\nin finite time [17] but, when regularized by surface tension corrections, the interface may\ndevelop various patterns including some of fractal-type (see [18] for a recent development\nand references therein).\nEq. (23) will provide the surface charge density \u03c3 as a function of time. From it, we\ncan compute the electric field and move the interface with (19). Two limits can be easily\nidentified in the case that there is no charge injection inside the plasma, i.e j\u2212\n\u03bd \u2248 0: a) the\nlimit of large conductivity\n\u033a\u22121 \u226b 1, E\u2212\n\u03bd = 0,\nso that the interface is equipotential and b) the limit of small conductivity\n\u033a\u22121 \u226a 1,\n\n\u2202\n(\u03c3\u2206\u03c4 ) = 0 \u21d2 \u03c3\u2206\u03c4 = Cte,\n\u2202t\n\nwhere the charge contained by a surface element is constant and the density only changes\nthrough deformation (with change of area) of the interface. In the next sections we will\nstudy the intermediate case of finite resistivity.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE CASE OF FINITE RESISTIVITY IN 2-D GEOMETRIES\n\nAs an application we will solve the 2-D case for different conductivities. In order to grasp\nsome features of the model first we will consider how fronts with radial symmetry evolve.\nThen we will study the stability of those fronts under small perturbations and finally solve\nthe model numerically in order to test some of the analytical predictions.\n10\n\n\fA.\n\nSolutions with radial symmetry\n\nThe electric potential created by a surface charge distribution with radial symmetry at\nthe distance r is found by solving the equation\n\u2206V = \u03c3\u03b4(r).\n\n(25)\n\nThe fundamental solution turns out to be in polar coordinates\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2C log |x|, |x| > r\nV (x) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3C log r,\n|x| \u2264 r\n\n(26)\n\nwhere C will be determined by the condition of the electric field jump (24) at the surface.\n\nFrom the potential solution we can compute the electric field which has a discontinuity at\nthe surface\nC\nE\u03bd+ = \u2212 .\nr\n\nE\u03bd\u2212 = 0,\n\n(27)\n\nFor the current density, the solution of (22) gives\nj=\n\nI(t)\nr,\n2\u03c0r 2\n\n(28)\n\nand finally using (23) and the fact that vN = dr/dt and \u03ba = 1/r, we get\n\u2202\u03c3 1 \u2202r\nI(t)\n+\n\u03c3=\u2212\n.\n\u2202t\nr \u2202t\n2\u03c0r\n\n(29)\n\nThis equation can be easily solved. We can write it as\n\u2202(r\u03c3)\nI(t)\n=\u2212\n,\n\u2202t\n2\u03c0\n\n(30)\n\nto get\nQ(t)\n,\n\u03c3=\u2212\n2\u03c0r\n\nwith Q(t) =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nI(t) dt,\n\n(31)\n\n0\n\nwhere we have assumed that \u03c3(0) = 0. Now we can see from the condition (24) that\nC = \u2212Q(t)/2\u03c0, so\n\nE\u03bd+ =\n\nQ(t)\n.\n2\u03c0r\n\nThen, defining \u03b5 \u2261 D, the interface evolves according to (1) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\nQ(t)\n1\ndr\n=\u2212\n+\u03b5\n+ 2 \u03b5\u03b1(|Q(t)/2\u03c0r|).\ndt\n2\u03c0\nr\n11\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\n\fWe shall analyze next two limiting cases.

We change by a\nsmall amount the position of the front as well as the charge density. The perturbed position\nand charge surface density of the interface on the interface will be parametrized using the\npolar angle as\nr(\u03b8, t) = r(t) + \u03b4S(\u03b8, t),\nQ(t)\n+ \u03b4\u03a3(\u03b8, t),\n\u03c3(\u03b8, t) = \u2212\n2\u03c0r(\u03b8, t)\nwhere r(t) is the solution of the equations for the radial symmetrical front, Q(t) =\nand \u03b4 a small parameter.\n12\n\n(41)\n(42)\nRt\n0\n\nI(t) dt\n\n\fThe electric potential will change by \u03b4Vp (x) after adding a geometrical perturbation of\nthe interface and some extra charge on it.

It corresponds to \u033a \u2192 0, and hence, from\n(57), we can conclude that \u03c6n \u2192 0. Physically this means that in the limit of very high\n\nconductivity, the electric field inside goes to zero (E\u03bd\u2212 \u2192 0), as we approach to the behavior\n\nof a perfect conductor. If we consider that Q(t) = Q0 is constant or its variation in time\nis small compared with the evolution of the modes (which also implies I(t) \u2192 0), and the\nsame for the radius of the front r(t) = r0 , we can try a solution sn = exp(\u03c9n t), \u03c6n = 0, to\n(55), and get a discrete dispersion relation of the form\n\u0013\n\u221a \u0012\n\u03b10\n1 (n \u2212 1)\nQ0\n\u03b5 2\n2\u03c0r0\n\u03c9n = \u2212\n(n \u2212 1) \u2212 2 (n \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03b5 2\n1+\n.\n2\u03c0r02\nr0\nr0\n|Q0 |\n\n(58)\n\nNext we consider the limit of finite resistivity, but such that the total charge is constant\nat the surface, or varies very slowly.

However, if we compare\n(58) and (60), for small n and vanishingly small \u03b10 there is a 1/2 factor discrepancy in\nthe dispersion curve between the two limits. The origin of this prefactor was discussed for\nplanar fronts in [20], and the dispersion relation for planar fronts was obtained in the case\nof constant charge in [9]. We get in this 2-D curved case the same factor 1/2 that we got\nfor the planar case. On the other hand, imposing constant potential at the surface gives a\nfactor of 1. The intermediate situations can be studied by solving the system (55) and (57).\nAnother important consequence is that in both cases the maximum growth correspond\nto a perturbation with\nn \u221d |Q0 |/D,\n16\n\n(61)\n\n\f1\n\nprovided that the \u03b5 2 term can be neglected and Q0 is negative, implying that the number\nof fingers increases with the net charge and decreases with electron diffusion.\n\nD.\n\nNumerical simulations\n\nIn order to test the analytical predictions, we have calculated numerically the dispersion\nrelation curves for the cases studied previously, when \u033a \u2192 0, so we have a perfect conducting\nplasma, and when \u033a remains finite. We will outline the numerical algorithms and present\nhere the results.\nWe start for the case of finite resistivity. The 2-D solution for the potential problem can\nbe written as\n1\nlog |x \u2212 x\u2032 | \u03c3(x\u2032 )ds\u2032 ,\n\u2202\u03a9 2\u03c0\nNote that the integration domain \u2202\u03a9 is the curve manifold.

So we can\nwrite\n\nE\u03bd = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n\nq\n(x \u2212 x\u2032 , y \u2212 y \u2032 ) (y\u03b2 , \u2212x\u03b2 )\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\nq\n\u03c3(x\n,\ny\n)\nx\u2032\u03b22 + y\u03b2\u2032 2 d\u03b2 \u2032 .\n2\u03c0 (x \u2212 x\u2032 )2 + (y \u2212 y \u2032 )2 x2 + y 2\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\nNow when approximating the integral as a discrete sum on the interface, i.e. E\u03bd+ limit, some\ncare must be taken. We need the limit E\u03bd+ on the interface. When x coincides with x\u2032\nthere is an extra contribution of half the pole, which is \u03c3(x)/2. The E\u03bd\u2212 can be obtained\nfrom the boundary condition (24), and the curvature must be expressed in the appropriate\ncoordinates system.\nThe case of constant potential, which corresponds to \u033a = 0, is treated numerically as\nfollows. We have to fulfill the condition\nZ\n1\nlog |x \u2212 x\u2032 | \u03c3(x\u2032 )ds = V0 ,\n\u2202\u03a9 2\u03c0\n17\n\n\fbeing V0 a constant for any x belonging to \u2202\u03a9.

The self contribution of the segment to the\nintegral is taken as\nZ\n\nAi\n\n1\nlog |xi \u2212 x\u2032 | ds =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nhi\n2\n\n\u2212\n\nhi\n2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nhi\nlog |x| dx =\nhi log \u2212 1 ,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\n\nbeing hi the length of Ai . So we end with the equation\nMij \u03c3j = V0 1,\nwhere 1 is the identity matrix, \u03c3j = \u03c3(xj ), and\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1 h log |x \u2212 x | , for i 6= j\ni\nj\n2\u03c0 j\nMij =\nh\n\uf8f3 1 hi log i \u2212 1\u0001 , for i = j\n2\u03c0\n2\n\nDue to the linearity of the problem, we can solve Aij \u03c3j = 1 and rescale subsequently the\nP\nsolution in order to fulfill\n\u03c3j hj = Q.\nIn the numerical simulations presented here, we will follow the evolution of a total initial\n\ndimensionless charge Q = \u221210 distributed uniformly along the curve given by\nx(\u03b8) = [1 + 0.05 cos(n\u03b8)] cos(\u03b8),\ny(\u03b8) = [1 + 0.05 cos(n\u03b8)] sin(\u03b8).\n\n(62)\n\nwhere n gives the mode of the perturbation and \u03b8 is the curve parameter. We assume that\nthere is not input current, so j\u03bd\u2212 = 0 in (23), and then compute the exponential growth of\neach mode for a small period of time in order to get the dispersion curve. In Fig. 3, for\ndifferent values of the inverse of the resistivity coefficient 1/\u033a (or effective conductivity), we\nplot the corresponding dispersion curves.\nNote that the slope increases with the increase of the conductivity of the plasma, the\nmaxima moves to higher modes, and for larger n's the dispersion curves become negative as\npredicted by (58) and (60). The slope around the origin n = 1 is larger for the case of ideal\nconductivity, i.e. when the interface is equipotential.\n18\n\n\f8\n6\n4\n\u03c9\n2\n0\n-20\n\n5\n\n10\nn\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFIG. 3.

We will use the experimental data presented at\nreference [21]. The experiment reported there consists in the measuring of the potential and\nelectric field distribution of a surface streamer discharge on a dielectric material. For that, a\ntechnique based on Pockels crystals have been applied in order to obtain some temporal and\nspatial resolution of the discharge (see the reference for details). However, a note of warning\nmust be done: a surface discharge is not a truly 2-D discharge, due to the fact that there\nis a vertical contribution of the electric field, and the discharge has two different interfaces,\nthe air and the substrate, so the boundary conditions are not the same that the presented\nso far in this paper. Nevertheless, and keeping that in mind, we may try a quantitative\nestimation \u00e0 la Fermi from our results and compare it with the actual experiment.\nHere it is a brief account of the experiment. A discharge is created on a dielectric surface\nusing a positive tip and branching is observed. Then the potential is measure using Pockels\ncrystals, laser pulses and a ccd camera. The temporal resolution is 3.2 ns and the electric\nfield close to the tip reaches values of 3 kV/mm, leaving behind a potential gradient of 0.5\nkV/mm. At position r = 8 mm the front moves with an estimated velocity from the pictures\nof 0.18 mm/ns (from the charge density data, the front has a radius of 4 mm at 3 ns, 8 mm\nat 15 ns and 9 mm at 28 ns). The pictures show a sharp interface for the charge distribution,\n19\n\n\fso our model should be able to give some quantitative predictions. Unfortunately, there is\nonly one discharge reported, so the estimations we are going to make are very rough.\nThe experimental data gives a characteristic front speed U0 \u2248 0.1 mm/ns, and E0 \u2248 200\nkV/m. In order to get an estimation of the diffusion coefficient D we can make use of the\nexpression (19). We take\nE+\n\u03bd \u2248\n\n3 kV/mm\n0.185 mm/ns\n\u2248 1.5, and vN \u2248\n\u2248 1.9,\nE0\nU0\n\nso that D \u2248 0.05 is the number that we get. Note that from the expression U0 = \u03bce E0 , we\ncould find the experimantal value for the mobility \u03bce for this discharge.\nNow we can make a prediction. The maximum of the dispersion relation will tell us the\nnumber of fingers one may find in such experiments. We have calculated the dispersion\nrelation for two limit cases. The limit of ideal conductivity (58) and the limit of infinite\nresistivity (60). Those limits would give a lower and upper estimation values for the actual\ndispersion relation. We expect that the experiment will lie in between and be closer to the\npredictions given by the limit of infinite resistivity, as the discharge is on a dielectric plate.\nBut before using those dispersion relations we need a further estimation for the surface\ncharge density. We can get the surface density from the jump of the electric field across the\ninterface. So the dimensionless expression reads\n\u03c30 \u2248\n\n(3 \u2212 0.5) kV/mm\n, at r0 = 8mm.\nE0\n\nIn the dispersion relation expressions (58) and (60) we have to make the substitution\nQ0 /2\u03c0r0 = \u03c30 and find the maximum for n. For the ideal conductivity case (58) yields\na maximum at n \u2248 76, and for the case of infinite resistivity (60), turns out n \u2248 14. Counting the numbers of real fingers in the experimental pictures at 15 ns, the number is around\n20 (one has to extrapolate the number as the pictures do not show the whole discharge).\nThis number is much closer to the lower limit as we pointed before, pointing in the direction\nthat the electrons on the dielectric surface, when moving through the plasma, feel a much\nhigher resistivity than in a conductor.\nAlthough we do not expect to capture the whole physics of the discharge with the contour\nmodel, some essentials ingredients for the early development of the front seem to be well\naccounted by it. The theoretical prediction made in this section is a rather good one, despite\nall the approximations made and gives some insight about the parameters involved, such\nthe mobility of the carriers, diffusion coefficient, number of fingers, and so no.\n20\n\n\fV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented the complete derivation of the contour dynamics moder electric discharges introduced in [12]. The model appears as the leading asymptotic description for the\nminimal streamer model when the electron diffusion coefficient is very small. It consists of\ntwo integro-differential equations defined at the boundary of the plasma region: one for the\nmotion of the points of the boundary where the velocity in the normal direction is given in\nterms of the electric field created by the net charge there, and a second equation for the\nevolution of the charge density at the boundary. This second equation is very similar to\nthe Taylor-Melcher model in electrohydrodynamics [13]. In the model the electric field is\ndetermined by solving Poisson equation with a given surface charge density, leading to a\nsingular integral of the density.\nOnce our model has been deduced, we have computed explicit solutions with cylindrical\nsymmetry and investigated their stabilities. The resulting dispersion relation is such as\nthe perturbation with the small mode number can grow exponentially fast. In fact, both\nthe number of modes become unstable and the mode that becomes most unstable (the one\ncorresponding to the dispersion relation) depends critically on the electric resistivity of the\nmedia. We have computed analytically the dispersion relation and found that the number\nof unstable modes grows with the inverse of the resistivity (the conductivity) and the most\nunstable mode also increases with it. In the limit of vanishing resistivity one can consider\nthe medium as a perfect conductor and therefore impose that the potential is constant at\nthe boundary. The dispersion relation for the model with finite resistivity converges to this\nlimit when resistivity tends to zero.\nWe have implemented a numerical procedure to solve our model in general situations.\nIn order to develop the numerical method, we needed to evaluate certain singular integrals\nthat appear when computing the electrical field. As one result of the numerical method, the\ndispersion relations have been computed and compared them with the analytical results.\nAs a difference to our previous communication [12], we have paid special attention to the\neffects of Townsend expression for impact ionization (5) on the dispersion relation and the\ncases of intermediate resistivities.\nFinally, we have taken some experimental data from a positive surface streamer discharge\nand compare them with our model predictions. The number of fingers calculated from our\n21\n\n\fmodel is of the same order of the observed one in the actual experiment. We have been able\nalso to estimate the diffusion coefficient from the data. We have shown that the behaviour\nof the carriers inside the plasma is closer to the limit of high resistivity, so the importance of\ntaking into account the plasma resistivity is made clear. Thus, it is proved that our contour\nmodel is able to capture essential parts of the physics involved in the earlier development\nthe streamer discharge, with an extra bonus: we can study more complex geometries and\ngeneral situations both analytically and numerically. We are now in the process to complete\nthe fully 3-D case and extend these results.\nThe authors thank support from the Spanish Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Ciencia under\nprojects AYA2009-14027-C05-04 and MTM2008-0325.\n\n[1] A.
