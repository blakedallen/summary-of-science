Polarization transfer in quasi-elastic nucleon knockout is sensitive to the properties of the\nnucleon in the nuclear medium, including possible modification of the nucleon form factor and/or\nspinor. In our recently completed experiment E03-104 at Jefferson Lab we measured the proton\nrecoil polarization in the 4 He(~e, e\u2032~p )3 H reaction at a Q2 of 0.8 (GeV/c)2 and 1.3 (GeV/c)2 with\nunprecedented precision. These data complement earlier data between 0.4 and 2.6 (GeV/c)2 from\nboth Mainz and Jefferson Lab. The measured ratio of polarization-transfer coefficients differs from\na fully relativistic calculation, favoring either the inclusion of a medium modification of the proton\nform factors predicted by a quark-meson coupling model or strong charge-exchange final-state\ninteractions. The measured induced polarizations agree well with the fully relativistic calculation\nand indicate that these strong final-state interactions may not be applicable.\nKeywords: proton recoil polarization, medium modification, final-state interactions\nPACS: 13.40.Gp, 13.88.+e, 25.30.Dh, 27.10.+h\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe observation of neutrinos involves the measurement of secondary particles they\ncreate when interacting with nuclear targets. The analysis of these data requires thus\na reliable understanding of the neutrino-nucleus reaction; see e.g. the calculations by\nSzczerbinska et al. [1] and Benhar et al. [2]. The advent of high-intensity neutrino beams\nmakes neutrino experiments with increased statistical precision possible and put strong\ndemands on the reduction of systematic uncertainties related to the modeling of neutrino\ninteractions.\nRelativity and final-state interactions (FSI) are two essential model ingredients for a\nsuccessful description of the electroweak cross sections [3]. A model ingredient which\nis not often considered are possible modifications of the internal structure of nucleons\nbound in the nuclear medium. However, a calculation by Lu et al. [4], using a quarkmeson coupling (QMC) model, suggests a measurable deviation from the free-space\nelectromagnetic form-factor over the Q2 range 0.0 < Q2 < 2.5 (GeV/c)2 . Similar measurable effects have recently been calculated in a light-front-constituent quark model by\nFrank et al. [5], a modified Skyrme model by Yakshiev et al. [6], a chiral quark-soliton\nmodel by Smith and Miller [7], and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model of Horikawa and\nBentz [8]. The connection between the modifications induced by the nuclear medium\nof the nucleon form factors and of the deep inelastic structure functions is discussed by\nLiuti [9] using the concept of generalized parton distributions.\nTsushima, Kim, and Saito have applied the QMC model to calculate the effect of\nbound nucleon form factors on charged-current neutrino-nucleus scattering [10]. They\nestimate the effect on the inclusive 12 C(\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bc \u2212 )X cross section and find a reduction of\n\n\f\u2248 8% for the total cross section. The correction due to the in-medium form factors could\nindeed be significant for a precise estimate of the charged-current neutrino-nucleus cross\nsection.\nElectron-nucleus scattering data provide strong constraints on nuclear modeling of\nneutrino reactions. The polarization-transfer in quasielastic nucleon knockout, (~e, e\u2032~N),\nis sensitive to the properties of the nucleon in the nuclear medium, including possible\nmodification of the nucleon form factor and/or spinor. This reaction is also believed to\nhave minimal sensitivity to reaction-mechanism effects; see, e.g., [11]. In free electronnucleon scattering, the ratio of the electric to magnetic Sachs form factors, GE and GM ,\nis given by [12]:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03b8e\nGE\nPx\u2032 Ee + Ee\u2032\n.\n(1)\n=\u2212 \u2032 *\ntan\nGM\nPz\n2m p\n2\nHere, Px\u2032 and Pz\u2032 are the transferred polarizations, transverse and longitudinal to the proton\nmomentum. The beam energy is Ee , the energy (angle) of the scattered electron is Ee\u2032\n(\u03b8e ), and m p is the proton mass.\nIn the following, the results of 4 He(~e, e\u2032~p)3 H experiments to study the proton knockout process will be discussed. In these experiments 4 He was chosen as target because of\nits high density and relatively simple structure, which facilitate microscopic calculations.\n\nEXPERIMENTS\nThe first 4 He(e, e\u2032~p)3 H polarization-transfer measurements were performed at the Mainz\nmicrotron (MAMI) at a four-momentum squared Q2 = 0.4 (GeV/c)2 [13] and as experiment E93-049 at Jefferson Lab Hall A at Q2 = 0.5, 1.0, 1.6, and 2.6 (GeV/c)2 [14].\nOur recent experiment E03-104 [15] has extended these measurements with two highprecision points at Q2 = 0.8 and 1.3 (GeV/c)2 . The data were taken in quasielastic kinematics at low missing momentum with symmetry about the three-momentum-transfer\ndirection to minimize conventional many-body effects in the reaction. In each experiment, two high-resolution spectrometers were used to detect the scattered electron and\nthe recoiling proton. The missing-mass technique was employed to identify 3 H in the\nfinal state. The proton recoil-polarization observables were extracted by means of the\nmaximum-likelihood technique, utilizing the azimuthal distribution of protons scattered\nby the graphite analyzer in a focal-plane polarimeter (FPP) [16].\nSince these experiments were designed to detect differences between the in-medium\npolarizations compared with the free values, both 4 He and 1 H targets were used. The\nresults of the measurements are expressed in terms of the polarization-transfer double\nratio, in which the helium polarization ratio is normalized to the hydrogen polarization\nratio measured in the identical setting:\nR=\n\n(Px\u2032 /Pz\u2032 )4 He\n.\n(Px\u2032 /Pz\u2032 )1H\n\n(2)\n\nAs a cross-check, the hydrogen results were also used to extract the free-proton formfactor ratio GE /GM , which was found to be in excellent agreement with previous\npolarization-transfer data [16, 17]. Nearly all systematic uncertainties cancel in R: the\n\n\fpolarization-transfer observables are to first order independent of instrumental asymmetries in the FPP, and their ratio is independent of the electron-beam polarization and\ncarbon analyzing power. Small systematic uncertainties are predominantly due to uncertainties in the spin transport through the proton spectrometer.\nThe induced proton polarization Py in (e, e\u2032~p) is a direct measure of final-state interactions and was also measured in the Jefferson Lab experiments. Its extraction is\ncomplicated by the presence of instrumental asymmetries.\n\nRESULTS\nThe polarization-transfer double ratio, R, is shown in Figure 1. The preliminary data\nof the present experiment E03-104 (filled circles) are consistent with our previous data\nfrom E93-049 [14] and MAMI [13] (open symbols). The final systematic uncertainties from E03-104 are expected to be much smaller than those shown here. The data are\ncompared with relativistic distorted-wave impulse approximation (RDWIA) calculations\nfrom the Madrid group [18]. The RDWIA calculation (dashed curve) overpredicts the\ndata by about 6%. After including the density dependent medium-modified form factors\nas predicted by Lu et al. [4] in the RDWIA calculation (solid curve) good agreement\nwith the previous data is obtained.1 This agreement has been interpreted as a possible\nevidence of proton medium modifications [14]. This interpretation is based on the more\neffective description of the data in a particular model in terms of medium modifications\nof nucleon form factors and requires to have excellent control of the inherent many-body\neffects, such as meson-exchange currents (MEC) and isobar configurations (IC). In addition, when probing nuclear structure, one has to deal with final-state interactions (FSI).\nIndeed, the observed suppression of the polarization-transfer ratio has been equally well\ndescribed in a more traditional calculation by Schiavilla [20] using free form factors by\nincluding charge-exchange final-state interactions and two-body charge and current operators (shaded band). Yet, the choice of the parameters for the charge-exchange FSI is\nnot well constrained by data.\nThe preliminary results from E03-104 possibly hint at an unexpected trend in the\nQ2 dependence of R. This is particularly interesting as other calculations of in-medium\nform factors suggest a different Q2 dependence than that of the QMC model. The high\nstatistics of the data from E03-104 will allow for a study of the individual polarization\nobservables as a function of missing momentum up to about 120 MeV/c.\nThe difference in the modeling of final-state interactions is the origin of the major\npart of the difference between the results of the calculations by Udias et al. [18] and\nSchiavilla et al. [20] for the polarization observables. Effects from final-state interactions\ncan be studied experimentally with the induced polarization, Py . Figure 2 shows the\ndata for Py . The induced polarization is small in this reaction. The sizable systematic\nuncertainties are due to possible instrumental asymmetries. Dedicated data have been\n1\n\nA Glauber-based calculations by Ryckebusch [19] gives R/RPWIA of about one and is not shown here.\nWe also do not show a chiral-soliton model calculation of the in-medium form factors by Smith and Miller\n[7], which give results similar to the QMC results.\n\n\fR / RPWIA\n\n1.1\n\nMadrid, RDWIA\n\nE03-104 (prelim.)\n\nMadrid, RDWIA + QMC\n\nE93-049\n\nSchiavilla, OPT + MEC\n\nMAMI\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\nQ (GeV /c )\nFIGURE 1.

The data are compared to calculations from\nthe Madrid group [18] and Schiavilla et al.

The data are compared with the results of the\ncalculations from the Madrid group and Schiavilla et al. at missing momenta of about\nzero. The data have been corrected for the spectrometer acceptance to facilitate this\ncomparison. Presently, the data suggest that the magnitude of the induced polarization\n(and thus the final-state interaction) is overestimated in the model of Schiavilla et al.. A\ncomparison of the model calculations in Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows that the in-medium\nform factors (solid curves) mostly affect the ratio of polarization-transfer observables,\nnot the induced polarization. It is a key element of E03-104 to have access to both.\nIn summary, polarization transfer in the quasielastic (e, e\u2032 p) reaction is sensitive to\npossible medium modifications of the bound-nucleon form factor, while at the same\ntime largely insensitive to other reaction mechanisms. Currently, the 4 He(~e, e\u2032~p)3 H\npolarization-transfer data can be well described by either the inclusion of mediummodified form factors or strong charge-exchange FSI in the models. However, these\nstrong FSI effects may not be consistent with the induced polarization data.
