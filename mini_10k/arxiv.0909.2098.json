Introduction\nIn microscopic-macroscopic treatments of nuclear fission [1], the whole nuclear system\nis characterized by some collective coordinates associated with some degrees of freedom\nthat determine approximately the behavior of many intrinsic variables. The basic\ningredients in such an analysis is a shape parametrization that depends on several\nmacroscopic degrees of freedom. The generalized coordinates of deformation vary in\ntime leading to a split of the nuclear system in two separated fragments. Thus, these\ncoordinates describe the change in time of the average field. Traditionally, in the\nlarge amplitude collective motion like fission or fusion, the calculation of the mass\nparameters are made within the cranking model [2, 3]. These parameters are calculated\nadiabatically. In reality, the nucleus can be excited with respect the ground state at any\ndeformation. The excitation energy is shared between the collective kinetic energy of\nthe fragments and the intrinsic energy released finally through gamma-ray and neutron\nemission. As mentioned in Ref. [4], no unique separation between these two kind of\ndumping can be realized. Several attempts were realized in order to investigate the\nchange of the cranking mass parameters as function of the intrinsic excitation energy.\nIn this respect, investigation based on the cranking model have been done for the\nrotational motion [5] and for the behavior of the temperature dependent mass parameter\n[6, 7, 8]. A theory for non-adiabatic cranking was proposed in Ref. [9] where the timedependent many-body Schrodinger equation is solved and the time dependence of the\ncollective motion is determined with the classical Lagrange equation of motion. It is\nworth to mention that in Ref. [10] an expression is derived for the collective kinetic\nenergy containing corrections up to the fourth-order in the collective velocities. The\nfourth-corrections to the cranking approximation at hyperdeformations were found very\nlarge. The authors concluded that the perturbation treatment when applied to fission\nis invalidated.\nIn this paper, a new treatment for the cranking model is realized that takes into\naccount the intrinsic excitation energy. In the next section, a semi-adiabatic cranking\napproximation is derived for even-even systems to investigate the general features of\nthe cranking mass parameters when the nucleus is internally excited. To make the\nproblem tractable, it is assumed that the system deforms slowly in time. Therefore,\nthe matrix elements of the time-derivative of the wave functions are smalls. Because\nthese matrix elements are responsible for quasi-particle excitations, our approximation\nallows to consider the system in a seniority-zero state during fission. In other words, the\ncontributions to the inertia originating from seniority-two configurations are considered\nnegligible. In section 3, the mass parameters are calculated. To obtain the inertia,\na least action trajectory for the evolution of the nuclear system is determined. The\nsingle-particle energies for protons and neutrons were calculated along this path.\nThen, the intrinsic excitation energy of the fissioning system is evaluated within the\ntime-dependent pairing equations of motion using different values of the inter-nuclear\nvelocities. At each deformation, instantaneous values of the single-particle densities and\n\n\f3\n\nCranking mass parameters for fission\n\nof the pairing moment components are deduced. The semi-adiabatic effective mass is\nevaluated using these values. Some behavior concerning the dependence of the cranking\nmass parameters versus the intrinsic excitation energy are extracted. In the last section,\na discussion is made.\n2. Formalism\nThe single particle motion of a particle in an average field is governed by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation that includes a Hamiltonian with pairing residual interactions.\nThis Hamiltonian depends on some time-dependent collective parameters q(t) = {q\u03bd (t)}\n(\u03bd = 1, ...n), such as the internuclear distances between the nascent fragments, the\nmass-asymmetry, the fragment deformations or the necking parameter:\nH(t) =\n\n+\n\u01ebk [q(t)](a+\nk ak + ak\u0304 ak\u0304 ) \u2212 G\n\nX\n\nk>0\n\nX\n\n+\na+\nk ak\u0304 ai a\u012b .\n\n(1)\n\nk,i>0\n\nwhere \u01ebk are single-particle energies, G is an monopole pairing interaction constant and\na+\nk denote creation operators. In order to obtain the time dependent pairing equations\nof motion, we shall start from the variational principle taking the following energy\nfunctional\n\u2202\n(2)\nL = h\u03c6 | H \u2212 ih\u0304 \u2212 \u03bbN\u0302 | \u03c6i\n\u2202t\nand by assuming the many-body state formally expanded as a superposition of time\ndependent BCS seniority-zero and seniority-two adiabatic wave functions\n| \u03c6(t)i = c0 (t) | \u03c6BCS i +\n\nX\n\ncjl (t)\u03b1j+ \u03b1l\u0304+ | \u03c6BCS i\n\n(3)\n\nj,l\n\nwhere\n| \u03c6BCS i =\n\n+\n(uk + vk a+\nk ak\u0304 ) | 0i\n\nY\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nis the seniority-zero Bogoliubov wave function. The excited seniority-two configurations\nare obtained by mean of quasiparticle creation and annihilation operators:\n\u03b1k = uk ak \u2212 vk a+\n;\nk\u0304\n\n\u03b1k\u0304 = uk ak\u0304 + vk a+\nk;\n\n\u03b1k+\n\n\u03b1k\u0304+\n\n=\n\nuk a+\nk\n\n\u2212\n\nvk\u2217 ak\u0304 ;\n\n=\n\nuk a+\nk\u0304\n\n+\n\n(5)\n\nvk\u2217 ak ;\n\nIn definitions (2) and (3), c0 and cjl are amplitudes of the two kinds of configurations,\n\u03bb is the chemical potential, and N\u0302 is the particle number operator. Because only the\nrelative phase between the parameters uk (vacancy amplitudes) and vk (occupation\namplitudes) matters, in the following uk is considered to be a real quantity and vk a\ncomplex one. To minimize the functional, the expression (2) is derived with respect the\nindependent variables vk , vk , c0 , cjl (the amplitudes of the wave function), together with\ntheir complex conjugates, and the resulting equations are set to zero.\nAs deduced in Refs. [11, 12] and as detailed in the Appendix, for a seniority-zero\nnuclear system, the pairing equations of motion are:\nih\u0304\u03c1\u0307k = \u03bak \u2206\u22170 \u2212 \u03ba\u2217k \u22060 ;\nih\u0304\u03ba\u0307k = (2\u03c1k \u2212 1) \u22060 + 2\u03bak (\u01ebk \u2212 \u03bb) \u2212 2G\u03c1k \u03bak ;\n\n(6)\n\n\f4\n\nCranking mass parameters for fission\n\nThis system is sometimes called time dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations\n[12]. These equations were already used to determine the intrinsic excitation energy\nin fission [13, 14] or to investigate the pair-breaking mechanism [15]. The following\nnotations are used in Eqs. (6) and in the remaining part of the article:\n\u22060 = G\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03bak ; \u2206jl = G\n\n\u03bak ;\n\nk6=j,l\n2\n\nk\n\n\u03bak = uk vk ;\n\n\u03c1k =| vk | ;\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u22060 is the gap parameter for the seniority-zero state while \u2206jl are related to\nseniority-two states. \u03bak are pairing moment components and \u03c1k are single particle\ndensities.\nAn estimate of the intrinsic seniority-zero state excitation energy [11] can be\nobtained with the relation\nE \u2217 = E0 \u2212 EBCS\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nE0 = h\u03c6BCS | H \u2212 \u03bbN\u0302 | \u03c6BCS i = 2\n\nX\n\n\u03c1k (\u01ebk \u2212 \u03bb) \u2212\n\nk\n\nX\n| \u22060 |2\n\u2212G\n\u03c12k ; (9)\nG\nk\n\nis the expected value of the Hamiltonian (1) for the seniority-zero state and EBCS is the\nstationary energy obtained by replacing \u03bak and \u03c1k within the time-independent BCS\nparameters \u03ba\u0303k and \u03c1\u0303k in formula (9).\nAs indicated in the Appendix, the next semi-adiabatic cranking formula can be\nobtained for the effective mass parameters B:\nB\u03bd\u03bc = B1\u03bd\u03bc + B2\u03bd\u03bc\n2\n\n= 2h\u0304\n\nX\n\n(Emn \u2212 E0 ) |\n\n(Emn \u2212\n\nm,n6=m\n\nX\n2\n\n+2h\u0304\n\nm\n\n\u221a\n\u03bam \u03c1m |\u03ban |\n\u221a\n|\u03bam | \u03c1n\n\nP\n\nm \u2202\u03c1m\n(Emm \u2212 E0 )( \u03ba\u03c1m\n\u2212\n\u2202q\u03bd\n\n(Emm \u2212\n\nP\n\nk6=m\n\n\u2212\n\nk6=m,n\n\n\u221a\n\u03ban \u03c1n |\u03bam | 2\n\u221a\n|\n|\u03ban | \u03c1m\n\nTk \u2212 E0 +\n\n\u03bam \u2202\u03ba\u2217m \u03ba\u2217m \u2202\u03c1m\n)( \u03c1m \u2202q\u03bc\n\u03ba\u2217m \u2202q\u03bd\n\nTk + Tm \u2212 E0 +\n\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\n| nihn | \u2202q\n\u2202q\u03bd\n\u03bc\nP\n2\n2\nk Tk ) (\u01ebm \u2212 \u01ebn )\n\nhm |\n\n| mi\n\n(10)\n\n\u03ba\u2217m \u2202\u03bam\n)\n\u03bam \u2202q\u03bc\nP\n2\nk Tk )\n\n\u2212\n\nwhere the values of \u03c1k and \u03bak are solutions of the time dependent pairing equations\n(6)i and the index \u03bd is associated to the collective coordinate q\u03bd ..

In the BCS stationary state, the derivatives\n\u2202 \u03c1\u0303m /\u2202q\u03bd and \u2202\u03ba\u0303m /\u2202q\u03bd depend only on the collective variables q\u03bd and the cranking\nformula can be easily obtained. On the other hand, if the system follows a trajectory\nin the configuration space and the motion is characterized by some given collective\nvelocities, then the derivatives depend also on q\u0307\u03bd . Therefore, the second term in Eq.\n(10) depends on the history of the system and can be calculated only if the variations\nof \u03c1k and \u03bak are known.

Their\nexpressions are given by the coupled channel system of equations (6). That means,\nthe term (15) is practically independent on the collective velocity and depends only\non the values of \u01ebm , \u03bam and \u03c1m , that is on the structure of the system and its intrinsic\nexcitation and represents the minimal collective kinetic energy. Therefore, the term (15)\ncan be viewed as an ground collective kinetic energy. In other words, if the nucleus is\ninternally excited and the derivatives of the probabilities \u03ba\u0307, \u03c1\u0307 are different from zero, the\nsystem possesses a minimal collective kinetic energy. The term (15) can be considered\nas responsible for energy transfer between intrinsic and collective degrees of freedom.\n3. Results\nThe calculation addresses the fission of 234 U. As already mentioned, the basic ingredient\nin our analysis is the nuclear shape parametrization. The nuclear shape parametrization\nused in the following is given by two ellipsoids of different sizes smoothly joined by a\nthird surface obtained [16] by the rotation of a circle around the axis of symmetry.\nFive degrees of freedom characterize this parametrization: the elongation given by the\ninter-nuclear distance R between the centers of the ellipsoids, the\nq two deformations of\nthe nascent fragments characterized by their eccentricities \u03b5i = 1 \u2212 b2i /a2i (i = 1, 2),\nthe mass asymmetry given by the ratio between the major semi-axis of the fragments\n\n\fCranking mass parameters for fission\n\n6\n\nFigure 1. Nuclear shape parametrization.\n\n\u03b7 = a1 /a2 , and the necking parameter related to the median curvature C = s/R3 (R3\nbeing the radius of the intermediate circle and S the sign associated to the curvature).\nThe meaning of all geometric parameters can be understand by inspecting the Fig. 1.\nAs specified in Ref. [5], first of all, a calculation of the fission trajectory in our fivedimensional configuration space, beginning with the ground-state of the system up to the\nexit point of the barrier must be performed. This can be done by minimizing the action\nintegral. For this purpose, two ingredients are required: the deformation energy V and\nthe tensor of the effective mass. The deformation energy was obtained [1] by summing\nthe liquid drop energy with the shell and the pairing corrections. The macroscopic\nenergy is obtained in the framework of the Yukawa plus exponential model [17] extended\nfor binary systems with different charge densities [18]. The Strutinsky microscopic\ncorrections were computed on the basis of the Woods-Saxon superasymmetric two-center\nshell model [16]. This model gives the single particle level diagrams by diagonalizing a\nWoods-Saxon potential, corrected within spin-orbit and Coulomb terms, in the analytic\neigenvalue basis of the two center semi-symmetric harmonic model [19, 20]. The effective\nmass is computed within the cranking adiabatic approximation as given in [5]. After\nminimization, the dependences between the generalized coordinates q\u03bd (\u03bd = 1, ...5) in the\n\n\fCranking mass parameters for fission\n\n7\n\nregion comprised between the parent ground state configuration and the exit point of the\nexternal fission barrier supply the least action trajectory. The ground-state corresponds\nto the lowest deformation energy in the first well. The least action trajectory is obtained\nwithin a numerical method. Details about the numerical procedure of minimization and\nabout the model can be found in Refs. [14, 16, 21] and references therein. Plots of the\nminimal deformation energy surface as function of the necking coordinate C and the\nelongation R are displayed in Figs. 2 (a) and (b). In Fig. 2 (b) the minimal action\ntrajectory is also plotted. The resulting 234 U fission barrier is plotted on Fig. 2 (c) as\nfunction of the distance between the centers of the nascent fragments R. Some nuclear\nshapes obtained along the minimal action trajectory are inserted in the plot.\nThe realistic level scheme along the least action trajectory were also obtained within\nthe superasymmetric Woods-Saxon two-center shell model. Within the energy diagrams,\nthe system (6) is solved having as initial conditions the stationary BCS state in the\nground state configuration. Three values of the internuclear velocity \u1e58 were taken into\naccount: 1 \u00d7 104 , 1 \u00d7 105 and 1 \u00d7 106 fm/fs, corresponding to a time to penetrate the\nbarrier comprised between [10\u221218 , 10\u221220 ] s. In Fig. 3 (a), the intrinsic excitation energy\ngiven by Rel. (8) is plotted as function of the internuclear distance for the three values\nof \u1e58. If the internuclear velocity increases, the excitation energy becomes larger.\nThe inertia along the trajectory was calculated within three different approaches:\nthe adiabatic cranking model of Ref. [5, 22, 23], the formula (14) within stationary\nBCS parameters \u03ba\u0303 and \u03c1\u0303 and the same formula within \u03ba and \u03c1 values given by Eq. (6).\nThe total effective mass is the sum of partial values obtained for neutron and proton\nsubsystems.\nIn Fig. 3 (c), the inertia along the minimal action path calculated within the\nadiabatic cranking model is displayed with a thick line. In the ground state of the\nfirst well, the inertia is very small. Large values of of the cranking inertia are obtained\naround the exit point of the outer fission barrier, close to the scission configuration.\nA value approaching the reduced mass is obtained after the scission point. A similar\nbehavior, exhibiting very large values of the inertia around the touching configuration,\nwas obtained for light systems in Ref. [24], where a version of the Woods-Saxon two\ncenter shell model based on the molecular orbital approach is used. In the same plot, a\nthin line gives the inertia obtained within formula (14) by using the stationary values \u03ba\u0303\nand \u03c1\u0303. This semi-adiabatic inertia exhibits a similar shell structure as the adiabatic\ncranking model. The semi-adiabatic model gives in general lower values than the\nadiabatic cranking one, excepting the regions of the ground state and of the scission\npoint where the values are larger.\nIn Fig. 3 (b) a comparison is made between inertia computed within relation (14)\nfor different values of the internuclear velocity. The same values of the internuclear\nvelocities \u1e58 were taken as those used to determine the excitation energies. The inertia\nalong the minimal action trajectory has the largest values for the lowest \u1e58 taken into\nconsideration. In general, the values obtained for \u1e58 = 1 \u00d7 104 fm/fs represent an upper\nlimit for the magnitude of the inertia. It must be mentioned that for this collective\n\n\fCranking mass parameters for fission\n\n8\n\nFigure 2.

The least action trajectory is superimposed. (c) Potential\nbarrier. Some shapes obtained during the fission process together with the values of\nthe elongation R are inserted.\n\nvelocity, the calculated intrinsic excitation energy is practically negligible. For higher\nvalues of \u1e58, when the excitation energy becomes important, the magnitude of the inertia\nis considerably lower. The values obtained for \u1e58 = 1 \u00d7 105 fm/fs and \u1e58 = 1 \u00d7 106 fm/fs\nare situated in the vicinity of those obtained within the stationary values. For the three\ncollective velocities, the shell structure resemble.\n4. Discussion\nIn Ref. [8], a temperature dependent cranking model that includes a parameter for\nthe dissipation was used. It was shown that the increase of the temperature smoothen\nand lower the mass parameter. In the high temperature limit, the cranking results are\nquite close to the irrotational flow results. Our calculations also show that the inertia\ndecreases when the excitation energy increases.\nSeveral approximations were derived in the literature to compute the collective\ninertia. In the frame of the response theory [25] the Hamiltonian is expanded around\na particular value of the macroscopic coordinate and the first derivative is treated with\nthe time dependent perturbation approach. Another method is related to the generator\ncoordinate method proposed in Ref. [26] within the Gaussian Overlap Approximation\n(GOA). This method allows to obtain a representation of any operator in the collective\n\n\fCranking mass parameters for fission\n\n9\n\nFigure 3. (a) Intrinsic excitation energies along the minimal action trajectory as\nfunction of the elongation R for three values of the internuclear distance velocity \u1e58:\nfull line \u1e58 = 1 \u00d7 104 fm/fs, dashed line \u1e58 = 1 \u00d7 105 fm/fs and dot-dashed line\n\u1e58 = 1 \u00d7 106 fm/fs. (b) The thick lines represent the inertia B divided by the reduced\nmass \u03bc for the three velocities taken into consideration as function of R. The same line\ntypes are used as in panel (a) for the values of the velocities. The thin line corresponds\nto the inertia computed within BCS parameters \u03ba\u0303 and \u03c1\u0303. (c) Comparison between the\ninertia calculated within formula (14) with stationary values \u03ba\u0303 and \u03c1\u0303 (thin line) and\nthe classical cranking formula [5] (thick line). Asymptotically, the two inertia reaches\napproximately the reduced mass \u03bc.\n\nspace. In general, the GOA mass is about 2/3 times smaller than the adiabatic\ncranking mass [27] but both quantities exhibits a similar shell structure. Adiabatic\nmass parameters for fission were derived also from the Time-Depedent Hartree-FockBogololiubov (TDHFB) theory [28]. A comparison between values of the collective mass\ntensor obtained with three diferent models, i.e., cranking, GOA and adiabatic TDHFB,\nshowed that the adiabatic TDHFB mass exhibits more pronounced variations than the\ncranking and the GOA masses. As expected, the GOA gives smaller values than the\ncranking model. Our results show that for stationary values of \u03ba\u0303 and \u03c1\u0303, the inertia is\nlower than the adiabatic cranking values.\nIn Ref. [29] the second 0+ collective energy level was calculated for the rareearth and actinide nuclei using the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule. The results\noverestimates the experimental values in average within a factor 2. This discrepancy\nca be caused either by the shape of the potential in the ground state or either by a\nsystematic too low value of the cranking inertia. In our calculations, in the first well\nhas larger values than that obtained within the adiabatic cranking model.\n\n\f10\n\nCranking mass parameters for fission\n\nIn conclusion, a semi-adiabatic formalism based on the time-dependent pairing\nequations was described. The values of the inertia obtained within this model exhibit\na strong dependence on the intrinsic excitation energy. In general, the semi-adiabatic\ninertia have a similar shell structure as the adiabatic cranking model.\n5.

APPENDIX\nIn order to simplify the calculations, the variations of the parameter uk and vk as function\nof the seniority number, called blocking effect, is neglected.

In order to obtain the equations of motion,\nthe previous expression must be derived with respect the independent variables ant their\ncomplex conjugates and the resulting expressions must be set to zero. The assumption of\na slowly varying deformation with respect the time will be used. In these circumstances,\nthe probability to find the system in a real or virtual seniority-two state is much lower\nthan the probability to find the system in a seniority-zero one.
