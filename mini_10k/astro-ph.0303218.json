Such an accelerator might\nbe the core of an active galaxy, powered by a supermassive black hole. In their pioneering work, Stecker, Done,\nSalamon and Sommers [1] calculated the expected diffuse\nflux of neutrinos from the sum of all active galaxies and\n\nfound that such a flux could be observable deep underground in a large neutrino detector. Further predictions\nhave followed (for a summary see for example the review\nof Learned and Mannheim [2]), and with the construction and operation of the first high energy neutrino detectors, the sensitivity has been reached to enable such\npredictions to be tested. Searches have been made and\nlimits have been reported by the DUMAND [3], Frejus\n\n\f[4], Baikal(\u03bde ) [5, 6], MACRO [7] and AMANDA(\u03bde ) [8]\nneutrino detectors. In this letter, we describe the search\nfor high energy extraterrestrial neutrino-induced muons,\nusing data collected during the austral winter of 1997\nwith the AMANDA-B10 detector [9, 10], located in the\nantarctic ice cap at the South Pole station.\nThe AMANDA (Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array) telescope detects high-energy muon-neutrinos\nby observing Cherenkov light from muons resulting from\nneutrino interactions in the ice surrounding, or the rock,\nbelow the detector. While extraterrestrial neutrinos will\nproduce high-energy muons from all arrival directions,\nthose coming from above the detector will be very difficult to separate from the overwhelming flux of downwardgoing cosmic-ray induced atmospheric muons. The majority of these muons are rejected by only accepting upward going neutrino-induced muons; the earth filters out\nmuons produced in the atmosphere on the other side\nof the planet. There is a small remaining flux of misreconstructed events which is removed by quality cuts\nthat leave only well reconstructed events. After the atmospheric muons are removed, there will remain a flux\nof upward going muons from cosmic ray induced atmospheric neutrinos that have penetrated the earth and interacted near the detector. This relatively well understood neutrino flux is a background to the search but\nhas been used to verify the performance of the detector\n[9, 10]. The separation of the extraterrestrial neutrinoinduced muons from the atmospheric neutrino-induced\nmuons is based on the expected energy spectrum of the\ndetected muons. Typically, a model of an extraterrestrial\nsource of neutrinos has a harder spectrum (e.g. \u223c E\u22122 )\n[11] than that of the atmospheric neutrinos (\u223c E\u22123.7 )\n[12, 13]. After accounting for neutrino interaction and\nmuon propagation, this energy difference carries over to\nproduce a harder muon energy spectrum for the extraterrestrial neutrino-induced muons near the detector. The\nenergy of the muon is not measured directly, but more\nenergetic muons tend to produce more Cherenkov light\nand thus more hit optical modules in the detector, and\nthis observable, the channel multiplicity (Nch ), is used as\nthe primary separator of higher energy extraterrestrial\nneutrino-induced muon events from the background of\nlower energy atmospheric neutrino-induced muons.\nIn this analysis, the event selection cuts were designed\nto retain high energy track-like events [14]. The detector simulation has changed from that used in the atmospheric neutrino analysis [10]. A new muon propagation code [15] was used, which accounts for all relevant stochastic light emission from the muons. The\ndepth-dependent optical properties of the fiducial ice\nwere determined using atmospheric muons as a calibration source.\nBefore the energy sensitive channel multiplicity cut was\nfinally applied, 69 events remained in the data sample,\nwhereas a full simulation of the detector response to the\n\nevents\n\n2\n\nData\natmos. \u03bd\u03bc\n-5 -2\n10 E \u03bd\u03bc\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90 100\nNch\n\nFIG. 1: Channel multiplicity distribution after final cuts,\nshowing the expected excess of events from an E\u22122 spectrum\nat the higher multiplicities.\n\natmospheric neutrino (Lipari [12]) flux (neglecting neutrino oscillations, which would reduce the prediction by\nonly a few percent) predicts 85 events for the 130 days\nof live time. The absolute difference in the numbers of\nevents is consistent with Poisson fluctuations, or with the\n\u00b125% [13] uncertainty in the atmospheric neutrino flux,\nor with uncertainties in the simulation efficiencies. The\ndistribution of the data and atmospheric simulation are\nshown in figure 1. The error bars on the data are 90%\nunified confidence intervals [16] for the fixed but unknown\nvalue of the mean rate \u03bc = \u03bcb +\u03bcs for each bin. Only one\nbin (Nch = 25 \u2212 30) has a background prediction inconsistent with the confidence interval. More specificially, a\ngeneralised likelihood ratio test of the shape of the atmospheric neutrino hypothesis as the parent distribution\nof the data yields a chance probability of 20%, which\nis too large to reject the shape of the atmospheric neutrino hypothesis. We choose to treat the rate of observed\natmospheric neutrinos as a constraint on the overall detector efficiency and then carry through an efficiency uncertainty from the atmospheric neutrino flux prediction\nand Poisson error on the observed rate. Therefore, to\ncalibrate the overall detector sensitivity, we take the 69\nevents as the best-fit estimate of the number of atmospheric neutrinos and rescale all efficiencies by a factor\n69/85. This is conservative, since if the first bin discrepancy was due e.g. to a simulation effect, then no\nrenormalisation would be needed, and the limits would\n\n\fData\natmos. \u03bd\u03bc + atmos. \u03bc\n-5 -2\n10 E \u03bd\u03bc\nave. event upper limit\n\n10 2\n\n10\n\n1\nFlux\n\nimprove slightly. We combine the Poisson error on the\nobserved rate of atmospheric neutrinos with the theoretical flux uncertainty (taken as a uniform probability\ndistribution centred about the best-fit flux \u03a6\u0302 and extending to \u00b10.25\u03a6\u0302) to compute the correlations between the\nbackground and efficiency for later use in the probability\ndistribution function used in the confidence interval construction. To incorporate these systematic uncertainties\nin the efficiencies into the limit calculations, we follow\nthe prescription of Cousins and Highland [17], as implemented by Conrad et al. [18] with the unified FeldmanCousins ordering and improved by a more appropriate\nchoice of the likelihood ratio test [19]. We also report\nall limits and sensitivities with and without the assumed\nuncertainty.\nIn addition to the data and atmospheric neutrino prediction, figure 1 also shows the prediction for an E\u22122\nsignal flux at a level E2 \u03a6(E) = 10\u22125 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV,\na flux that would have been readily detected. Setting a\nlimit on a flux \u03a6(E) involves determining an experimental\nsignal event upper limit \u03bc(nobs , nb ), which is a function\nof the number of observed events, nobs , and expected\nbackground, nb , after the cuts are applied. A simulation chain accounting for neutrino absorption, interaction and neutral current regeneration, muon propagation\nand detector response gives the number of signal events,\nns , expected from the source flux \u03a6(E). The limit on the\nsource flux will then be \u03a6limit (E) = \u03a6(E)\u00d7\u03bc(nobs , nb )/ns .\nThe choice of final cut is optimised before examining the\ndata by minimising the average \"model rejection factor\"\n(MRF) \u03bc\u0304(nobs , nb )/ns [20], where the as yet unknown\nexperimental event limit \u03bc(nobs , nb ) is replaced by the\naverage upper limit \u03bc\u0304(nb ) [16]. Over an ensemble of hypothetical repetitions of the experiment, this choice of\ncut will lead to the best average limit \u03a6\u0304limit (E).\nThe integrated channel multiplicity distribution is\nshown in figure 2. Also shown is the 90% confidence\nlevel Feldman-Cousins average upper limit which is a\nfunction of the expected background. The optimal cut\nis the one where the model rejection factor \u03bc(nb )/ns is\nminimised. Figure 2 also shows the average flux upper\nlimit (E2 \u03a6 \u00d7 MRF) as a function of the choice of multiplicity cut. The minimum flux limit occurs at a cut\nof Nch \u2265 54, where we expect nb = 3.06 and an average signal event upper limit of 4.43 ignoring the uncertainties in the efficiency and background, and 4.93\nwhen the uncertainties are included. The 10\u22125 E\u22122 signal flux would produce 56.7 events. This leads to corresponding expected average limits on the source flux of\nE2 \u03a6\u030490% (E) = 7.8 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV (excluding\nuncertainties), and 8.7\u00d710\u22127 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV (including uncertainties).\nWe note that the expected overall flux limit is relatively insensitive to the choice of cut, with a broad minimum seen in figure 2 in the range of multiplicities 50-70.\nWe now apply this optimal multiplicity cut to the data,\n\nintegrated events\n\n3\n\n10\n\naverage flux upper limit\n-2\n-2 -1 -1\n-1\nin E cm s sr GeV\n\n-6\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90 100\nNch cut\n\nFIG. 2: Integrated distributions of event numbers as a function of the multiplicity cut (top plot). The minimum in the\nflux average upper limit (bottom) is found by minimising the\nratio of the average event upper limit to the expected E\u22122\nsignal.\n\nand find that 3 events remain. Ignoring the systematic\nuncertainties gives an event limit of 4.36 and a flux upper limit of E2 \u03a690% (E) = 7.7 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV.\nIncluding the systematic uncertainties leads to an event\nlimit of 4.75 and our final flux limit on an E\u22122 spectrum\nof E2 \u03a690% (E) = 8.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV.\nFigure 3 shows the neutrino energy spectrum of the\nsimulated events before and after the multiplicity cut of\n54 channels, for both atmospheric neutrinos and neutrinos from an E\u22122 spectrum. The multiplicity cut corresponds to a sensitive energy range of 6-1000 TeV, which\ncontains 90% of the expected E\u22122 signal. The peak response energy is just below 100 TeV.\nJust as a limit was placed on an assumed E\u22122 spectrum, limits can be placed on any neutrino flux prediction, and we consider a sample of predictions that\nare near the limit-setting capability of the detector\n(MRF \u223c 1). For each case, we optimise the final Nch cut\nto minimise the expected average flux upper limit, then\ncompare the expected number of extraterrestrial neutrino\nevents after the cuts to the observed event limit; those\npredictions that produce expected event numbers greater\nthan the observed event limit are excluded at the stated\nclassical confidence level. The results of these calculations are shown in table I and in figure 4. For each flux\nwe again report two sensitivities and limits - one assuming no systematic uncertainties and the second including\n\n\fpass initial cuts\n\n-2\n\n2 -1\n\n10\n\n-5\nAMANDA-B10 E-2 \u03bde\n\n-5.2\n\n-1\n\n10 E \u03bd\u03bc\natmos. \u03bd\u03bc\n-5\n\nlog10 E \u03a6\u03bd(E) [cm s sr GeV]\n\nevents\n\n4\n\nFrejus \u03bd\u03bc (diff. at E\u03bd=2.6 TeV)\n\n-5.4\n\nMACRO E-2 \u03bd\u03bc\n\n-5.6\n\nSS QC\npred.\nA-B10 lim.\n\npass\nall\ncuts\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-5.8\nBaikal E-2 \u03bde\n\n-6\n\n-6.2\n\nCharm D\npred.\n\nCharm D\nA-B10 lim.\n\n-6.4\n-6.6\n\nAMANDA-B10 E-2 \u03bd\u03bc\n\nAtmospheric\nneutrinos\n\n-6.8\n10\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n7\nlog10(E\u03bd) [GeV]\n\nFIG. 3: Energy spectrum of the incident atmospheric (dashed\nlines) and E\u22122 (solid lines) neutrinos for events that pass the\ninitial cuts (thin lines), and have channel multiplicity greater\nthan the optimum cut of 54 channels (thick lines).\n\nsystematic uncertainties. We find that the predictions of\nSzabo and Protheroe (SPH92L [21], P96p\u03b3pp [22]) are\nexcluded. The quasar core (SSQC) prediction of Stecker\nand Salamon [11] is just excluded (MRF = 0.98), but\nthe blazar jet (SSBJ) prediction is not. The limit of the\noriginal Stecker, Done, Salamon and Sommers flux [1]\n(SDSS) is a factor of 2 above the prediction and therefore the prediction is not excluded.\nMaximal mixing from neutrino oscillations [23, 24] between \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 during propagation to the earth would\nlead to limits a factor of two greater than quoted here\ndue to the loss of half the expected \u03bd\u03bc flux into the \u03bd\u03c4\nstate. However, some of these \u03bd\u03c4 would regenerate \u03bd\u03bc in\nthe earth (\u03bd\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) lessening the effect [25, 26].\nWe also place a limit on a model of prompt charm induced neutrinos [27] (ZHV92) in the earth's atmosphere\nand find that the detector sensitivity is about a factor\nof 4 away from excluding the prediction. More recent\npredictions are even further below the sensitivity of the\ndetector [28].\nSince most events will originate from neutrinos near\nthe peak of the detector sensitivity E\u03bd \u223c 105 GeV, the\nlimits at that point for the three different spectral shapes\n(E\u22122 , SSQC and Charm D) are similar, as seen in\nfigure 4.\nThe limits presented in this letter, based on the first\nreal-time year of operation of the AMANDA-B10 de-\n\n-7\n\n3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5 8\nlog10(E\u03bd) [GeV]\n\nFIG. 4: Summary of experimental 90% classical confidence\nlevel flux limits from various detectors assuming an E\u22122 spectrum.

Since most\nevents will originate from neutrinos near the peak of the detector sensitivity (E\u03bd \u223c 105 GeV), the limits at that point for\ndifferent spectral shapes are similar.\n\ntector, are the strongest placed to date on extraterrestrial diffuse neutrino fluxes. Since that year, we estimate\nthat about 10 times the exposure has been achieved in\ntotal with AMANDA-B10 (1997-99) and the expanded\nAMANDA-II detector (2000-present).
