M. J. French\nPhysics Department, Clifton College, Guthrie Road, Clifton, Bristol\nE-mail: mail@matthewfrench.net\nIn this brief article I describe an experiment to illustrate how a fuse works. I have used this\nas part of lessons for my year 11 classes to demonstrate how an electrical fuse 'blows' when too\nhigh a current passes through it.\nA Variac (also known as an autotransformer) is connected to the mains and to the primary\ncoil (approximately 100 turns) of a transformer with a laminated iron core. The secondary coil of\nthe transformer (approximately 8 turns) is connected to two thick metal terminals with screw\nattachments. A thick piece of wire (approximately 1-1.5mm diameter \u2013 actually a piece of wire coat\nhanger) is connected between the two screw attachments across the secondary coil. See figure 1.\nWhen the mains supply to the Variac is turned on the transformer acts to step down the voltage and\nstep up the current. As the Variac output voltage (i.e. the voltage across the primary coil of the\ntransformer) is turned up to around 240V, the current flowing through the wire (connected across\nthe secondary coil of the transformer) increases so much that it began to heat up (since power =\ncurrent2 x resistance). The wire will soon begin to glow, first red and then white before it melts \u2013\nexactly what happens with a fuse. See figure 2. This provides a great way for pupils to visualise\nwhat happens when a fuse blows. It can also be used to demonstrate the transformer effect: stepping\ndown a voltage and so stepping up the current if power is conserved (if the transformer is 100%\nefficient).\nThe safety aspects of this demonstration need to be considered carefully by the individual\nteacher before it is attempted. There are obvious dangers due to the high voltages used and proper\nprotected high voltage leads should be used for all the connections. The circuit should not be\ndismantled unless unplugged from the mains. The wire on the secondary coil (and in the attached\ncircuit) needs to be very thick as it must not melt when the coat hanger wire does so with the same\ncurrent flowing through it. The equipment should be placed on heat proof mats to protect the desk\nand safety screens should be used to protect both the pupils and the teacher. The wire which melts\nwill remain very hot for some considerable time after the demonstration is complete and pupils\nshould not be allowed to touch it even as they leave at the end of the lesson.\n\n\fFigure 1: Diagram of the equipment which shows the Variac (right) which is connected to\nthe transformer (middle) and the coat hanger wire (left). The coat hanger wire is attached through a\nshield made from a heat proof mat and is placed on a heat proof mat. Safety screens should be in\nplace when this equipment is used to protect both the pupils and the teacher.\n\nFigure 2: Composite image showing 8 frames in succession of the thick coat hanger wire as\nit melts due to the heat generated by the high current passing through it.\n\n\f"}
