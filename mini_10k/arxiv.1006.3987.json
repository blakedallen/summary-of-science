As a consequence, their corresponding probability densities cannot both be arbitrarily concentrated. The reason for that phenomenon is the\nwave-particle duality formalized by the Fourier transform\nbetween the position and momentum representation of\nthe state vector \u03c8 in Hilbert space. The state of minimum uncertainty in terms of standard deviations is well\nknown to be satisfied by Gaussian wave functions.\nAn alternative measure of uncertainty is the entropy of\na continuous distribution (differential entropy) [2]. The\nfirst statement concerning a lower bound of that measure for the continuous probability densities of position\nand momentum in quantum mechanics was conjectured\nby Everett 1957 [3] and Hirschman [4]. It was proved in\n1975 by Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski [5] and Beckner\n[6]. However, the direct physical interpretation of this\ninequality is not always clear because its scale of measurement sets an arbitrary zero corresponding to a uniform distribution over a unit volume. Any distribution\nwhich is more confined than this has less entropy and\nwill be negative. The experimental possibility to check\nentropy inequalities for continuous variables associated\nwith tomograms (tomographic approach) is discussed in\n[7][8].\nFor practical purposes, the measurement of observables\ntypically involves an apparatus which always introduces\na countable partitioning of the spectrum of the operator A into non overlapping subsets (usually called bins).\nTo this partitioning of the spectrum there corresponds\nthe partitioning of the Hilbert space into orthogonal subspaces, each subspace representing one bin. The corresponding projection operator P\u0302iA is associated to the appropriate subspace of the Hilbert space.\nFor a given pure state of the system, to each projection operator one can assign the probability pA\ni that a\nmeasurement will give a value belonging to the i-th bin\nof the partition. The application of this framework to\nposition and momentum requires the partitioning of the\nspectrum of x\u0302 and p\u0302 into bins which are usually taken all\nequal to \u03b4x and \u03b4p.

However, this\ninequality is not sharp since for measurement resolutions\n\u03be \u2265 e/2, this bound becomes trivially satisfied, see Fig. 1.\nOn the other hand, Krishna and Parthasarathy [12]\nhave generalized a result of Maassen and Uffink [13]\n(Kraus' conjecture [14]) for pairs of projective measurements of a finite level system. Following the remarks\nmade in [13], it seems possible to extend their result,\nso as to be applicable also to the case when the Hilbert\nspace is infinitely dimensional, as long as we restrict ourselves to projective measurements of observables. With\nTheorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.3 of [12], using ||P\u0302ix P\u0302kp ||2 =\n||P\u0302ix P\u0302kp P\u0302ix || for all i, k and finally applying a Lemma of\n[15], one gets the lower estimate\nH (x) + H (p) \u2265 \u2212 ln \u03bb0 (\u03be).\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03bb0 (\u03be) is the largest eigenvalue of a Fredholm integral equation known in the context of communication\ntheory by Slepian and Pollak [16]. The same result has\nrecently been mentioned in [17][18].\nBecause both bounds above are not tight, one might\nask for a nontrivial interpolation which approaches to (3)\nfor small values of \u03be and tends to be zero according to\n(4) for \u03be \u2192 \u221e. Since the function \u03bb0 (\u03be) monotonically\n\n(5)\n\nThe right hand side proceeds slightly above the envelope\nof both lower bounds (Fig. 1). We checked (5) for gaussian wave functions in the state of minimum uncertainty\nby numerical calculations. In Fig. 2, we see the entropy\nfor different values of resolutions \u03b4x. For every fixed \u03b4x\nand increasing \u03be there is a saturation of the total entropy\nat the level of H (x) . That is because H (p) approaches to\nzero for increasing values of \u03b4p = h\u03be/\u03b4x.\nFurther numerical calculations have been considered\nfor single-slit wave functions and for eigenfunctions of\nthe Fourier kernel (spheroidal wave functions).
