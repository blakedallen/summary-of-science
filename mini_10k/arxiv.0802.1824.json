(1986), and in three-dimensions by Singh et al. (1994, 2001) and\nPartha S. Pal\nDepartment of Physics & Astrophysics, University of Delhi, Delhi - 110 007, India\nHarinder P.

Srivastava\nDepartment of Physics & Astrophysics, University of Delhi, Delhi - 110 007, India\n\n\f2\n\nPartha S. Pal et al.\n\nRobinson et al. (2004). In the studies by Hurlburt et al. and Singh et al., several models were computed\nto study the overshoot of convective motions from unstable into the upper stable layer in a non-rotating\nconfiguration. It was found that the motions from the convective region penetrate a significant fraction\nof pressure scale height into the stable layer above. Singh et al. (1994) also found that the penetration\ndistance above the convection zone (\u2206u ) scales as \u2206u \u223c (Fb /\u03c1ctop )1/3 , where Fb is the input flux\nand \u03c1ctop is the density at the top of the convection zone. Robinson et al. (2004) performed threedimensional simulations of the upper radiation-convection transition layer with more realistic modeling\nfor three subgiant stars. For the present Sun they found the overshoot to be 0.5Hp , for the 11.3-Gyr\nsubgiant it was 0.75Hp , while for a 11.6-Gyr subgiant it was approximately 1Hp , Hp being the local\npressure scale height.\nSimulations of the effects of rotation on convective penetration or overshooting have been studied\nby Brummel et al. (2002), Ziegler & R\u00fcdiger (2003), Browning et al. (2004), K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 et al. (2004), and\nPal et al. (2007). Brummel et al. (2002) and Pal et al. (2007) examined the behaviour of penetrative\nconvection below a convection zone under the influence of rotation by means of three-dimensional\nsimulations. They found that with an increase in rotational velocity, the downward penetration decreased. A similar behaviour was observed when the stability of the lower stable layer was increased\nin a rotating configuration. Furthermore, the relative stability parameter S showed an S \u22121/4 dependence on the penetration distance implying the existence of a thermal adjustment region in the lower\nstable layer rather than a nearly adiabatic penetration zone. Ziegler & R\u00fcdiger (2003) and K\u00e4pyl\u00e4 et\nal. (2004), using their 3D MHD codes also found that, as a general feature, the overshooting at the\nbottom decreases as a function of increasing rotation at a given latitude.\nBrowning et al. (2004) performed three-dimensional simulations of core convection within A-type\nstars at a range of rotation rates. They found that as convective motions enter the stable stratification\nof the radiative envelope, increasing the rotation rate enhances the overshooting.\nIn this paper, we perform large eddy simulations of turbulent convection in a f-plane configuration\nto study the effect of rotation on the penetration distance above the convection zone. A total of 17\ntwo-layer (lower unstable \u2013 upper stable) models have been set up to examine the effect of rotation\nrate (\u03a9) and colatitude (\u03b8) on the penetration distance. In some models, we systematically vary the\nstability of the upper stable layer to study its effect on the penetration distance. In one model, we\nincrease the horizontal resolution to see if the penetration distance is altered.\nIn the next section, we give the essential ingredients of the simulations and the parameters of the\ncomputed models. In Section 3, we provide the results and their discussion. Important conclusions of\nthe study are listed in Section 4.\n\n2 Parameters of Computed Models\nThe general behaviour of convective transport in a stellar-type setting has been studied using Large\nEddy Simulation (LES) approach by several groups (Chan & Sofia 1986, Hossain & Mullan 1991, 1993,\nMuthsam et al. 1995, Singh & Chan 1993, Singh et al. 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998a,b, 2001 Saikia et al.\n2000, Chan 2001, Pal et al. 2007). LES, being less demanding on speed and memory as it can have a\ncoarser grid, allows large scale flows to be modeled explicitly while the smaller scales are modeled by\nsome sort of sub-grid scale formulation (Smagorinsky 1963).\nPal et al. (2007) numerically solved the Navi\u00e9r-Stokes equations and incorporated the rotational\neffects by considering an f-plane configuration. A plane parallel layer of perfect gas was considered in\na rectangular box which can be viewed as a small portion of a spherical shell. We use a configuration\nthat is similar to that of Pal et al. (2007) except that the computational domain has two layers (lower\nunstable \u2013 upper stable) rather than their three layer sandwich (stable-unstable-stable) configuration.\nThe choice is justified as we are interested in studying the behaviour of penetrative convection above\na convection zone rather than below as was the aim of Pal et al. (2007). The spherical shell rotates\naround the polar axis from west to east and the angular velocity vector \u03a9 points toward the north\npole. We use a right handed cartesian coordinate system in which X and Y denote the horizontal\ndirection and Z denotes the upward vertical direction. The gravity vector is denoted by g and is along\nthe negative Z direction. The angle between \u03a9 and the Z axis is denoted by \u03b8 and the rotation vector\n\u03a9 lies in the XZ plane. The tilted rotation vector is kept constant implying a uniform angular velocity\nof the sphere.\n\n\fPenetration above rotating convection zones\n\n3\n\nTable 1 Physical Parameters for Models R1 to R17\nPolytropic Indices\nModels\nR1-R13\nR14\nR15\nR16\nR17\n\nGrid\n35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 96\n35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 96\n35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 96\n35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 96\n46 \u00d7 46 \u00d7 96\n\nFb\n0.125\n0.125\n0.125\n0.125\n0.125\n\nTop\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n2.0\n\nBottom\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n\nLayer Thickness(PSH)\nPb\n4655\n19767\n65092\n178290\n4655\n\nTb\n19.5\n17.8\n16.8\n16.1\n19.5\n\n\u03c1b\n238\n1106\n3862\n11024\n238\n\nTop\n6.04\n7.12\n8.01\n8.76\n6.04\n\nBottom\n2.40\n2.77\n3.07\n3.33\n2.40\n\nThe rectangular computational domain has an aspect ratio of 1.5 and a mesh of 35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 96 points.\nThe top and bottom boundaries are kept impenetrable and stress-free while the side boundaries are\nmade periodic.

The polytropic index of the upper stable layer is taken to be 2.0 in all these models\n(R1-R13). In models R2 to R5, \u03b8 is varied from 22.5 \u25e6 to 90 \u25e6 while \u03a9 is fixed at 0.25. In the second set\nof models R0, R10, R11 and R13, \u03a9 is varied from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.25, respectively, keeping \u03b8 fixed\nat 0 \u25e6 . In models R3, R7, and R12, \u03a9 is 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0, respectively, while \u03b8 is fixed at 45 \u25e6 . In the\nlast set of models R14 to R16, polytropic index of the upper stable layer is varied from 3 to 5 while\nall the other parameters are the same as model R7. Another model R17, having a grid of 46 \u00d7 46 \u00d7 96\npoints and all other parameters same as R7 (\u03a9 = 0.5, \u03b8 = 45 \u25e6 ) is computed to examine the effect of\nincrease in the number of grid points (resolution) in the horizontal plane.\nAs described , four models, namely, R7, R14, R15 and R16 have been set-up to examine the effect\nof stability of the upper stable layer on the penetration height of these rotating configurations. Each\nof these four models have different polytropic indices in the upper stable layer, namely, 2, 3, 4 and 5\nfor the cases R7, R14, R15 and R16, respectively. For all these four models, the values of \u03a9 and \u03b8 are\nkept constant at 0.5 and 45 \u25e6 respectively. Similar to the relative stability parameter S for the lower\nstable layer (Hurlburt et al. 1994, Singh et al. 1995, Pal et al. 2007), we can define a relative stability\nparameter for the upper stable layer for these four cases as:\nS=\n\nmi \u2212 ma\n; mi = 2, 3, 4, 5,\nm2 \u2212 ma\n\n(3)\n\nwhere mi denote the polytropic indices of the upper stable layer for various cases, m2 is the polytropic\nindex of the upper stable layer for our case R7 and ma = 1/(\u03b3 \u2212 1) is the adiabatic index. Here, we\nhave taken \u03b3 = cp /cv as 5/3. Thus, for our reference case R7 the relative stability parameter S is equal\nto unity and for cases R14, R15 and R16 it comes out to be 3, 5 and 7, respectively.\n\n\fPenetration above rotating convection zones\n\n5\n\nTable 2 Numerical Parameters for the 17 models\nModels\nR1-R15,R17\nR16\n\ng\n50\n50\n\nC\u03bc\n0.2\n0.2\n\n\u2206t\n0.00054795\n0.00027397\n\nt\n1698\n1698\n\nNCF L\n0.1\n0.05\n\n\u2206min\n0.007074\n0.007074\n\nTable 3 Dynamical Parameters of the Computed Models\nModel\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nR5\nR6\nR7\nR8\nR9\nR10\nR11\nR12\nR13\nR14\nR15\nR16\nR17\n\n\u03a9\n0\n0.25\n0.25\n0.25\n0.25\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\n0.25\n0.50\n1.0\n1.0\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\n\n\u03b8/\u03c0\n0\n1/8\n1/4\n3/8\n1/2\n1/4\n1/4\n1/4\n1/2\n0\n0\n1/4\n0\n1/4\n1/4\n1/4\n1/4\n\n\u03b8\n0o\n22.5o\n45o\n67.5o\n90o\n22.5o\n45o\n67.5o\n90o\n0o\n0o\n45o\n0o\n45o\n45o\n45o\n45o\n\nhv \u2032\u2032 i\n0.074\n0.059\n0.064\n0.070\n0.066\n0.056\n0.059\n0.067\n0.064\n0.058\n0.054\n0.069\n0.050\n0.036\n0.026\n0.019\n0.062\n\nCo\n0.000\n4.231\n3.914\n3.579\n3.776\n8.980\n8.432\n7.411\n7.795\n4.278\n9.283\n14.474\n20.004\n13.714\n19.013\n25.469\n7.971\n\nRo\n\u221e\n0.236\n0.255\n0.279\n0.265\n0.111\n0.119\n0.135\n0.128\n0.234\n0.108\n0.069\n0.050\n0.073\n0.053\n0.039\n0.126\n\nRe\n1088.883\n894.394\n947.021\n1022.810\n957.403\n840.540\n879.430\n975.684\n875.589\n889.006\n822.673\n1011.623\n768.311\n876.052\n895.473\n799.152\n1107.676\n\nTa\n0.00E+0\n5.728E+7\n5.502E+7\n5.360E+7\n5.227E+7\n2.279E+8\n2.200E+8\n2.091E+8\n1.864E+8\n5.787E+7\n2.331E+8\n8.576E+8\n9.448E+8\n5.774E+8\n1.160E+9\n1.659E+8\n3.118E+8\n\n\u2206u\n0.055\n0.057\n0.057\n0.051\n0.031\n0.060\n0.055\n0.052\n0.022\n0.058\n0.063\n0.052\n0.063\n0.013\n0.006\n0.005\n0.049\n\n\u2206p (PSH)\n0.384\n0.399\n0.399\n0.354\n0.210\n0.422\n0.385\n0.362\n0.147\n0.407\n0.445\n0.363\n0.446\n0.111\n0.061\n0.058\n0.340\n\n3 Results and Discussion\nAll 17 models computed in this study have a two layer configuration in which the stable region is\nplaced above the convectively unstable region. Model R1 is non-rotating while models R2 to R17 are\nall rotating, differentiated by a set of values of rate of rotation (\u03a9), the angle between the Z-axis and\nthe rotation vector (\u03b8) and the polytropic index (or stability) of the upper stable layer. Tables 1 and\n2 list the physical parameters of all the models.\nThe interface of the unstable-stable layer is located at a height of 0.6 from the bottom. This implies\nthat the thickness of the lower stable layer is 0.6 or 60% of the total domain of computation while the\nupper stable layer has a thickness of 0.4 corresponding to 40% of the total domain. The total domain\nof computation contains about 8.44 pressure scale heights (PSH) for models R1-R13 and R17 with\nthe upper stable layer containing 6.04 PSH while the lower convective layer contains 2.40 PSH. For\nmodels R14, R15 and R16 the total domain has around 9.89, 11.08 and 12.09 PSH, respectively with\nthe upper stable layer containing around 7.12, 8.01 and 8.76 PSH, respectively.\nIt may be noticed that although the upper stable layer occupies only 40% of the domain, it contains\nmore than 70% of the PSH. This is because the length of the PSH decreases as we go from bottom to\nthe top. The density contrast (\u03c1bottom /\u03c1top ) of models R1-R13 is 238.0 while the temperature contrast\n(Tbottom /Ttop ) is 19.5 (cf. Table 1). For model R16 the density contrast is the maximum (11024).\nAfter the fluid has thermally relaxed, it is further evolved for another 1, 00, 000 time steps and\nthe time and horizontal averages are taken for quantities of interest. Figure 1 shows the distribution\nof various energy fluxes with height for a number of models. The calculation of the extent of the\npenetration into the upper stable layer has been based on time- and horizontally averaged kinetic flux\n(Fk ). Such a choice is obvious as the kinetic flux is directly related with the motions and the profile\nis also convenient for estimation of the extent of penetration (Hurlburt et al. 1986, Hurlburt et al.\n1994, Singh et al. 1994,1995, Saikia et al. 2000, Pal et al. 2007). We illustrate this point by plotting\nthe distribution of kinetic energy flux for several sets of models in Fig. 2. The kinetic energy flux\nis negative in most of the convectively unstable region. Near the interface in the unstable region it\nincreases and becomes positive and then falls to zero in the upper stable region. Ideally, the extent of\npenetration should correspond to the first zero of the kinetic energy flux in the stable layer above the\nunstable-stable interface. However, we define the penetration height (\u2206u ) to be the distance from the\ninterface of the unstable-upper stable layer to where Fk has fallen to a value of 0.0001 in the upper\n\n\fPartha S.

The corresponding values of angular rotational velocity (\u03a9) are 0, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0,\nrespectively. For these four cases the angle (\u03b8) between the rotation vector and the vertical axis is 0 \u25e6 , (b)\nR10, R2, R3, R4 and R5.

The extent of penetration distance (\u2206u ) and penetration distance in PSH (\u2206p ) for all the\n17 models are given in Table 3.\nIn Fig. 3(a), we show the horizontally averaged kinetic energy flux as a function of depth and time\nfor model R1. We have plotted 500 profiles of Fk which corresponds to every 200th time step. In Fig.\n3(b), we show a time series of penetration distance \u2206u calculated by using the criterion outlined above.\nThe mean penetration is indicated by the horizontal dashed line.\nWe now describe the effect of varying various parameters, e.g., \u03a9, \u03b8, S, and the horizontal resolution\non the penetration distance above the convectively unstable region.\n\n3.1 Dependence of penetration height on \u03a9\nTwo sets of models R1, R10, R11 and R13 and R3, R7 and R12 have been computed to examine the\neffect of rate of rotation on the penetration distance. In models R1, R10, R11 and R13, the rotation\nrate (\u03a9) is systematically increased from 0 to 1.0 in steps of 0.25 (cf. Table 3). In all these four models,\nthe rotation vector (\u03b8) is kept at 0 \u25e6 , implying that the rotation vector coincides with the Z-axis or\nthe vertical direction. Figure 4(a) shows the dependence of penetration distance on \u03a9 for these four\nmodels. In model R1, which is a non-rotating case (\u03a9 = 0), the penetration distance \u2206u = 0.055 or\n0.384 PSH. As the rotation rate increases to 0.25 in model R10, the distance \u2206u increases to 0.058\n\n\fPenetration above rotating convection zones\n\n7\n\nFig. 3 (a) Horizontally averaged kinetic energy flux as a function of time. Total of 1,00,000 profiles were\ncollected out of which 500 (every 200th) are plotted for case R1. The height is denoted in the grid points\nstarting from one at the bottom (b) Penetration height (\u2206u ) with time for model R1 for 1,00,000 time steps\n(computed at every 10th time step).\n\nwhich corresponds to 0.407 PSH. For models R11 and R13 having \u03a9 = 0.5 and 1.0 respectively, the\npenetration distance increases further to 0.445 PSH and 0.446 PSH respectively.\nIn the second set of models R3, R7 and R12, while the rotation rates are, respectively, 0.25, 0.5 and\n1.0, \u03b8 is changed to 45 \u25e6 . We find that unlike in the first set of models (with \u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 ), the penetration\ndistance decreases with increase in the rotation rate. For example, the upward penetration decreases\nfrom 0.399 PSH (Model R7, \u03a9 = 0.25) to 0.363 PSH (Model R12, \u03a9 = 1.0). The buoyancy-breaking\nis accentuated as rotation rate is increased when \u03b8 is 45 \u25e6 .\nThe penetrative behaviour is markedly different from the case of downward penetration (Pal et al.\n2007), in which the penetration distance (\u2206d ) decreased with increase in the rotation rate, for any\nfixed value of colatitude \u03b8.\nFor the two sets of models with \u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 and \u03b8 = 45 \u25e6 , we examine the behaviour of pentration height\nwith Rossby number. Figure 5(a) shows the variation of penetration height in PSH (\u2206p ) with Rossby\nnumber (Ro) for three cases R10, R11 and R13 having \u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 and \u03a9 = 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0, respectively.\nA smaller Rossby number implies a larger rotation rate and the penetration distance increases with\ndecrease in the Rossby number from 0.407 PSH for model R10 to 0.446 PSH for model R13. For this\nset of models with \u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 , we see a relationship \u2206p \u223c 0.38 Ro\u22120.059.\n\n\f8\n\nPartha S.

In this as well as in all the subsequent figures, error bars denote the standard\ndeviation in \u2206p computed for 1, 00, 000 time steps after the fluid has thermally relaxed.\n\nFig. 5(b) shows the variation of \u2206p with Ro for the second set of models R3, R7 and R12 having\n\u03b8 = 45 \u25e6 and \u03a9 = 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0, respectively. For this set, the penetration distance decreases with\nthe decrease in Rossby number. Model R3 with Ro = 0.255 has \u2206p = 0.399 PSH, while R12 with\nRo = 0.069 has \u2206p = 0.363 PSH. This set of models shows a scaling relation of \u2206p \u223c 0.44 Ro0.072 .\n\n3.2 Dependence of penetration height on colatitude \u03b8\nA set of five models R10, R2, R3, R4 and R5 has been examined to study the effect of co-latitude (\u03b8)\non the penetration distance. All the models have \u03a9 = 0.25 while \u03b8 is changed from 0 \u25e6 (Model R10) to\n90 \u25e6 (Model R5) in steps of 22.5 \u25e6. Figure 4(b) shows the plot of \u2206p against \u03b8 for these five models. At\n\u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 , the penetration distance is maximum 0.407 PSH. It decreases slightly for successive values of\n\u03b8, and for \u03b8 = 90 \u25e6 (case R5) has the minimum value of 0.210 PSH.\nSingh et al.

We attempt to find a\nsimilar relationship which includes the effects of rotation.\nIn Fig. 6(a), we have plotted (Fb /\u03c1ctop )1/3 /\u2206p for \u03a9 = 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 corresponding to models\nR10, R11, and R13, respectively. We find a scaling relationship \u2206p \u223c (Fb /\u03c1ctop )1/3 /0.283(\u03a9)\u22120.065 for\nthe three cases having \u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 . For cases R3, R7, R12 having \u03b8 = 45 \u25e6 (Fig. 6(b)), we have a relationship\nof the form \u2206p \u223c (Fb /\u03c1ctop )1/3 /0.35(\u03a9)0.068 .\nFor a set of models with a particular value of \u03b8, we have\n\n\u2206p = c1 Rox1\n\nand \u2206p =\n\n(Fb /\u03c1ctop )1/3\n,\nc 2 \u03a9x 2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere c1 and c2 are constants and x1 and x2 are the scaling powers for Ro and 1/\u03a9.\nOne can use relations (4) to compute back the power laws of Fig. 6 by writing\n\n\u03a9 x2 =\n\nx2 =\n\n(Fb /\u03c1ctop )1/3\n,\nc1 c2 Rox1\n\nln\n\n(Fb /\u03c1ctop )1/3\nc1 c2 Rox1\n\nln \u03a9\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\n\f10\n\nPartha S.

The dashed line shows the scaling relationship (a) 1/\u03a9 \u22120.065 and (b) 1/\u03a9 0.068\nfor the two sets of models.\n\nSubstituting the value of Ro, c1 , c2 , x1 , and \u03a9 in Eqn.(6), we find that for cases with \u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 , x2\nto be \u22120.063 and for cases with \u03b8 = 45 \u25e6 it is 0.062 which are close to the values \u22120.065 and 0.068,\nrespectively, as shown in Fig. 6.\n\n3.3 Dependence of penetration height on relative stability parameter S\nWe have constructed four models with different stability parameter (S) defined in Eqn. (3) by varying\nthe polytropic index of the upper stable layer. We have S = 1, 3, 5 and 7 for cases R7, R14, R15 and\nR16, respectively. In Fig. 2(c), we have plotted the distribution of the kinetic energy flux with height\nfor these four models. The values of the angular velocity (\u03a9) and angle between the rotation vector and\nvertical axis (\u03b8) are fixed at 0.5 and 45 \u25e6 , respectively, for these models. The corresponding penetration\nheights \u2206u and \u2206p (in PSH) are given in the last two columns of Table 3. Figure 2(c) clearly shows\nthe differences in the kinetic flux profile with S especially in the region near the stable-unstable layer\ninterface. We find a decrease in penetration distance from 0.385 PSH in model R7 (S = 1) to 0.058\nPSH in model R16 (S = 7). Figure 7 shows the instantaneous vertical velocities at the horizontal\ninterface of the unstable-stable interface for models R7 and R16. The vertical velocities for model R16\nwith stiffer stable layer (S=7) are much lower compared to that of model R7 (S=1).\nFig. 8 shows the variation of penetration distance with stability factor S for models R7, R14, R15,\n& R16. These models show a scaling relationship \u2206p \u223c S \u22121 . This means that the convection is efficient\nenough to establish a nearly adiabatic stratification in the upper stable layer and the penetration is\nnearly adiabatic (Hurlburt et al. 1994, Zahn 2002).

Polytropic\nindices of the upper stable layer are 2 (Model R7) and 5 (Model R16).\n\nFig. 8 Variation of penetration distance \u2206p with stability parameter S for models R7, R14, R15 and R16.\nHere, \u03a9 = 0.5 and \u03b8 = 45 \u25e6 .

Table 3), while for the non-rotating\nmodel R1A with increased resolution, it is 0.303 PSH.\nTwo rotating models R7 and R7A examine the effect of change in both horizontal and vertical\nresolution on the penetration distance. We notice a decrease in penetration depth from 0.385 PSH\nin model R7 (35 \u00d7 35 \u00d7 96) to 0.333 PSH in model R7A (64 \u00d7 64 \u00d7 128). It may be noticed that\nwhile models R1 and R7 had almost same penetration distance, the decrease in \u2206p with increased\nresolution is smaller for model R7A which has a higher rotation rate compared to model R1A which\nis non-rotating. It seems that the effect of increase in resolution on penetration is different for models\nwith different rotation rates.\nThree models R7, R17, and R7B examine the effect of horizontal resolution on the penetration\ndistance above the convection zone. While all the models have 96 grid points in the vertical, they differ\nin their horizontal resolution. Model R7 has 35 \u00d7 35 grid points in the horizontal direction, model\nR17 has 46 \u00d7 46 and model R7B has 96 \u00d7 96 grid points. The penetration distance decreases with the\nincrease in horizontal resolution from 0.385 PSH (Model R7) to 0.340 PSH (Model R17) to 0.268 PSH\n(Model R7B).\n\n4 Conclusions\nWe have computed 17 models and presented the results of our three-dimensional numerical simulations of turbulent compressible convection penetrating into a radiative envelope under the influence of\nrotation. We find that the penetration distances for these models lie in the range 0.058 PSH \u2264 \u2206p \u2264\n0.446 PSH.\nRecently, Woo & Demarque (2001) put an empirical constraint on the convective core overshoot for\nintermediate-to-low mass stars by using Roxburgh's integral constraint. They found that the proper\nlimit of core overshoot for these stars would be 15% of the core radius. In Table 5, we have shown this\ncalculation for our 17 models. We have computed the penetration distance in PSH as a percentage of\nthe total size of the convection zone. The size of the convection zone is taken from the last column\nof Table 1 while the penetration height (\u2206p ) has been taken from the last column of Table 3. As can\nbe seen from Table 5, We find an upper limit on the penetration into the upper radiative layer to be\naround 18.5%.\nFor rotation about a vertical axis (\u03b8 = 0 \u25e6 ), the penetration into the upper stable region increases\nas the angular rotational velocity (\u03a9) increases or the Rossby number (Ro) decreases. However, this\ntrend is reversed for rotation around an inclined axis. When the angle (\u03b8 = 45 \u25e6 ), the penetration\ndistance into the radiative envelope decreases with increasing \u03a9 owing to horizontal mixing. To see\nthe effect of change of angle of inclination on penetration, angle \u03b8 is systematically varied from 0 \u25e6 to\n90 \u25e6 in steps of 22.5 \u25e6 for five models with a fixed angular velocity \u03a9= 0.25. We again find that the\npenetration distance decreases as the colatitude \u03b8 is increased. We do not see this behaviour changing\neven when the resolution is increased.\nWe also find that the penetration distance above the convection zone obeys a scaling relation of\nthe form \u2206p \u223c S \u22121 appropriate for nearly adiabatic penetration even in the presence of rotation. The\npresent simulations need to be extended to include more realistic input physics and a higher resolution\nto enable us to get a better insight into the dynamics of rotating convection near the convective-\n\n\fPenetration above rotating convection zones\n\n13\n\nradiative interface. Since the motivation of the study was to look into the effect of varying rotation\nrates on the penetration distance, we needed to compute several models. Due to the restrictions in\nspeed and memory, we were unable to increase the resolution of all the models. We hope to achieve\nthis in future studies.\nAcknowledgements PSP is grateful to University Grants Commission, India for a Senior Research Fellowship.
