As a consequence of our result on L(s, sym2 (g) \u00d7 sym2 (g)) one gets a\ngood upper bound for the spectrally normalized first coefficient a(1, 1) of sym2 (g).\n(In the artihmetic normalization, a(1, 1) would be 1.) In a different direction, we\nare able to show that the symmetric sixth and eighth power L-functions of modular\nforms f with trivial character (Haupttypus) are holomorphic in (1\u2212 logcM , 1), where\nM is the thickened conductor (see section 1) and c a universal, positive, effective\nconstant; by a recent theorem of Kim and Shahidi ([KSh2001]), one knows that\nthese L-functions are invertible in R(s) \u2265 1 except possibly for a pole at s = 1. If\nf runs over holomorphic newforms of a fixed weight (resp. level), for example, the\nthickened conductor M is essentially the level (resp. weight). We will in general\nwork over arbitrary number fields and use the adelic language.\nFirst some preliminaries. Suppose D(s) is any Dirichlet series given as an Euler\nproduct in {R(s) > 1}, which admits a meromorphic continuation to the whole\ns-plane with no pole outside s = 1, together with a functional equation relating s\nto 1 \u2212 s after adding suitable archimedean factors. By an exceptional zero, or a\nSiegel zero, or perhaps more appropriately (cf. [IwS2000]) a Landau-Siegel zero, of\nD(s), one means a real zero s = \u03b2 of D(s) which is close to s = 1. More precisely,\nsuch a zero will lie in (1 \u2212 logCM , 1), where C is an effective, universal constant > 0\n(see section 1). The Grand Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) would imply that there\nshould be no such an exceptional zero, but it is of course quite hard to verify.\nIt was shown in [HRa95] that for any number field F , the L-function L(s, \u03c0)\nof a cusp form \u03c0 in GL(2)/F admits no Landau-Siegel zero. In the special case\nwhen \u03c0 is dihedral, i.e., associated to a character \u03c7 of a quadratic extension K of\nF , L(s, \u03c0) is simply the abelian L-function L(s, \u03c7) considered by Hecke, and if \u03b8 is\nPARTIALLY SUPPORTED BY THE NSF GRANT DMS-9801328\n1\n\n\f2\n\nD.Ramakrishnan and S.Wang\n\nthe non-trivial automorphism of K/F , the cuspidality of \u03c0 forces \u03c7 to be distinct\nfrom \u03c7 \u25e6 \u03b8. We will say that \u03c0 is of type (K/F, \u03c7) in this case.\nIt was also shown in [HRa95] that for any n > 1, the standard L-series L(s, \u03c0) of\ncusp forms \u03c0 on GL(n)/F admit no Landau-Siegel zero if one assumes Langlands's\nprinciple of functoriality, in particular the existence of the automorphic tensor\nproduct. An analogous, but slightly more complicated, statement can be made for\ngeneral Rankin-Selberg L-series on GL(n)\u00d7GL(m), but assuming the full force of\nfunctoriality is but a distant dream at the moment, though it is highly instructive to\nbe aware of what it entails. So it becomes an interesting problem to know how much\none can unconditionally prove by making use of available instances of functoriality;\nthe method has to deviate some from that given in [HRa95]. This is what we carry\nout here for n = m \u2264 3.\nRoughly speaking, the main point is to find a suitable positive Dirichlet series\nD(s) which is divisible by the L(s) of interest to a degree k, say, which is (strictly)\nlarger than the order of pole of D(s) at s = 1. If there is anything creative here, at\nall, it is in the proper choice of D(s) and then in the verification of the holomorphy\nof D(s)/L(s)k , at least in a real interval (t, 1) for a fixed t < 1. It should be noted,\nhowever, that this approach fails to give anything significant for L-functions of\nquadratic characters; for two very interesting, and completely different, approaches\nfor this crucial case see [IwS2000] and [GS2000].\nNow fix a number field F and consider the Rankin-Selberg L-function L(s, \u03c0\u00d7\u03c0 \u2032 )\nassociated to a pair (\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 ) of cusp forms on GL(2)/F . Denote by \u03c9, resp. \u03c9 \u2032 , the\ncentral character of \u03c0, resp. \u03c0 \u2032 . Our first main result is the following\nTheorem A Let \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 be cuspidal automorphic representations of GL(2, AF ).\nThen L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) admits no Landau-Siegel zero except possibly in the following\ncases:\n(i) \u03c0 is non-dihedral and \u03c0 \u2032 \u2243 \u03c0 \u2297 \u03bc with \u03c9\u03bc of order \u2264 2;\n(ii) \u03c0, resp. \u03c0 \u2032 , is dihedral of type (K, \u03c7), resp. (K \u2032 , \u03c7\u2032 ), with K \u2032 = K and \u03c7\u2032 \u03c7\nor \u03c7\u2032 (\u03c7 \u25e6 \u03b8) of order \u2264 2.\nIn case (i), resp. (ii), the exceptional zeros of L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) are the same as those of\nL(s, \u03c9\u03bc), resp. L(s, \u03c7\u2032 \u03c7)L(s, \u03c7\u2032 (\u03c7 \u25e6 \u03b8)). In case (ii), if \u03c7\u2032 \u03c7 or \u03c7\u2032 (\u03c7 \u25e6 \u03b8) is trivial,\nthen the exceptional zeros are the same as those of \u03b6K (s). In either case, there is\nat most one exceptional zero.\nFor the vast majority of cases not satisfying (i) or (ii), L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) has no\nexceptional zero. In particular, if \u03c00 , \u03c00\u2032 are fixed, non-dihedral cusp forms on\nGL(2)/F which are not twist equivalent to each other, there exists an effective\nconstant c > 0 such that the family L(s, \u03c00 \u00d7 (\u03c00\u2032 \u2297 \u03c7)), with \u03c7 running over\nquadratic characters\nof conductor\nq prime to the levels of \u03c00 , \u03c00\u2032 , admits no real\n\u0011\n\u0010\nc\n.\nzero \u03b2 with \u03b2 \u2208 1 \u2212 logq\nIn case (i) we have\n\nL(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) = L(s, \u03c9\u03bc)L(s, sym2 (\u03c0) \u2297 \u03bc).\n\nThe non-existence of Landau-Siegel zeros for L(s, sym2 (\u03c0)) (for \u03c0 non-dihedral)\nhas been known for a while by the important work of Goldfeld, Hoffstein, Lieman\nand Lockart ([GHLL94]). For general \u03bc, the non-existence for L(s, sym2 (\u03c0) \u2297 \u03bc) is\nknown by [Ba97], following an earlier reduction step given in section 6 of [HRa95].\nSo our Theorem is not new in this case.\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\n3\n\nFor any cusp form \u03c0 on GL(2)/F , let L(s, \u03c0; symn ) denote, for every n \u2265 1, the\nsymmetric n-th power L-function of \u03c0 (see section 1 for a definition). It is expected\nthat there is an automorphic form symn (\u03c0) on GL(n + 1)/F whose standard Lfunction coincides with L(s, \u03c0; symn ). This is classical ([GJ79]) for n = 2 and a\nmajor breakthrough has been made recently for n = 3 ([KSh2000]) and for n =\n4 ([K2000]). The proof of Theorem A uses the result for n = 3 as well as the\nconstruction of the first author ([Ra2000]) of the Rankin-Selberg product of pairs\n(\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 ) of forms on GL(2)/F as an automorphic form \u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 on GL(4)/F .\nRecall that \u03c0 is dihedral iff it admits a self-twist by a non-trivial, necessarily\nquadratic, character. One says that it is tetrahedral, resp. octahedral, iff sym2 (\u03c0),\nresp. sym3 (\u03c0), is cuspidal and admits a non-trivial self-twist by a cubic, resp.\nquadratic character. It is well known that sym2 (\u03c0) is cuspidal ([GJ79]) iff \u03c0 is\nnot dihedral. It has been shown in [KSh2000], resp. [KSh2001], that sym3 (\u03c0),\nresp. sym4 (\u03c0), is cuspidal iff \u03c0 is not dihedral or tetrahedral, resp. not dihedral,\ntetrahedral or octahedral. We will henceforth say that a cusp form \u03c0 on GL(2)/F\nis of solvable polydedral type if it is either dihedral or tetrahedral or octahedral. Our\nsecond main result is the following:\nTheorem B Let \u03c0 be a self-dual cuspidal automorphic representation of GL(2, AF ).\nThen the set of Landau-Siegel zeros of L(s, sym2 (\u03c0) \u00d7 sym2 (\u03c0)) is the union of the\nsets of Landau-Siegel zeros of abelian L-functions of the form L(s, \u03c7), \u03c72 = 1, which\ndivide L(s, sym2 (\u03c0) \u00d7 sym2 (\u03c0)), if any. Moreover, if \u03c0 is not of solvable polyhedral\ntype and if \u03b6F (s) has no exceptional zero (for example when F = Q), then there is\nno exceptional zero.\nThis theorem holds also for any cuspidal \u03c0 on GL(2)/F which is a unitary\ncharacter twist of a selfdual representation.\nThe following corollary of Theorem B gives precise bounds for the Petersson\nnorm on GL(3)/Q of the symmetric square of a Maass wave form g of level 1. In\nSection 6 (see Definition 6.3), we will define a suitably normalized function sym2 (g)\nspanning the space of the Gelbart-Jacquet square lift to GL(3)/Q of the cuspidal\nautomorphic representation \u03c0 generated by g.\nCorollary C Let g be a Maass form on the upper half plane H, relative to SL(2, Z),\nof weight zero and Laplacian eigenvalue \u03bb, which is also an eigenfunction of Hecke\noperators. Then for each \u03b5 > 0,\n1\n<< h sym2 (g), sym2 (g) i <<\u03b5 (\u03bb + 1)\u03b5 ,\nlog(\u03bb + 1)\nwhere sym2 (g) is spectrally mormalized as in Theorem B.\nMoreover, if {a(m, n)} denotes the collection of Fourier coefficients of the spectrally normalized function sym2 (g)/||sym2 (g)||, we have\n|a(1, 1)| << log(\u03bb + 1).\nOur proof of Theorem B will establish on the way that the symmetric 4-th power\nL-function of any self-dual cusp form \u03c0 on GL(2), not of solvable polyhedral type,\nadmits no Landau-Siegel zero. A slew of interesting results for the L(s, \u03c0; symn ) for\nn up to 9 have been established recently by H. Kim and F. Shahidi in [KSh2001],\nproving in particular the meromorphic continuation, functional equation and holomorphy in R(s) \u2265 1, except for a possible pole at s = 1. It may be of some interest\nto know, for n > 4, how far to the left of s = 1 can the holomorphy assertion\n\n\f4\n\nD.Ramakrishnan and S.Wang\n\ncan be extended. A consequence of our work is the following tiny, but apparently\nnon-trivial, extension to the left of s = 1 for n = 6, 8.\nTheorem D Let F be a number field and \u03c0 a self-dual cusp form on GL(2)/F of\nthickened conductor M . Then there exists a universal, effective constant c > 0 such\nthat L(s, \u03c0; sym6 ) and L(s, \u03c0; sym8 ) have no pole in the real interval (1 \u2212 logcM , 1).\nNow we will say a few words about the proofs.\nRegarding Theorem A, suppose we are in the main case, i.e., neither \u03c0 nor \u03c0 \u2032 is\ndihedral and also \u03c0 \u2032 is not isomorphic to \u03c0 \u2297 \u03bc for any character \u03bc. Under these\nhypotheses, \u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 is cuspidal on GL(4)/F by [Ra2000]. When it is not self-dual,\nthere is a simple argument (see section 3 of [HRa95]) to deduce the non-existence\nof a Siegel zero. So we may assume that \u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 is self-dual, which implies that the\ncentral characters \u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 of \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 are inverses of each other. For simplicity assume\nfor the moment that \u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 are trivial. (For a full treatment of the general case, see\nsection 4.) Then the key point is to appeal to the following identity of L-functions\nL(s, \u03a0 \u00d7 \u03a0) =\u03b6F (s)L(s, sym2 (\u03c0))2 L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0)4 L(s, sym3 (\u03c0) \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 )2\nL(s, sym2 (\u03c0) \u00d7 sym2 (\u03c0))L(s, (\u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 ) \u00d7 (\u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 )).\n\nwhere \u03a0 is an isobaric automorphic form on GL(8)/F defined by\n\u03a0 = 1 \u229e \u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 \u229e sym2 (\u03c0),\nwhere 1 denotes the trivial automorphic form on GL(1)/F and \u229e the Langlands\nsum operation on automorphic forms defined by his theory of Eisenstein series\n([La79]), proved to be well defined by the work of Jacquet and Shalika ([JS81]).\nThe degree 64 Rankin-Selberg L-function L(s, \u03a0 \u00d7 \u03a0) has the standard analytic\nproperties and defines, in R(s) > 1, a Dirichlet series with non-negative coefficieents.\nMoreover, it has a pole of order 3 at s = 1, and since since L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) occurs in its\nfactorization to a power larger than 3, a standard lemma (see Lemma 1.7) precludes\nthe latter from having any Landau-Siegel zero. We also need to show that the ratio\nL(s, \u03a0 \u00d7 \u03a0)/L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 )4 is holomorphic, for which we appeal to the automorphy\nof sym3 (\u03c0) ([KSh2000]).\nThe proof of Theorem B involves a further wrinkle, and uses in addition the automorphy of sym4 (\u03c0) ([K2000]), as well as the works of Bump-Friedberg ([BuG92])\non the symmetric square L-functions of GL(n). The well known identity\nL(s, sym2 (\u03c0) \u00d7 sym2 ) \u03b6F (s)L(s, sym2 (\u03c0))L(s, sym4 (\u03c0))\nreduces the problem to studying the Landau-Siegel zeros of L(s, sym4 (\u03c0)). We\nshow in section 5 (see Theorem B\u2032 ) that for \u03c0 not of solvable polyhedral type,\nL(s, \u03c0; sym4 ) has no exceptional zero. To do this we set\n\u03a0 : = 1 \u22a0 sym2 (\u03c0) \u229e sym4 (\u03c0),\nand consider\nL(s, \u03a0 \u00d7 \u03a0) =\u03b6F (s)L(s, sym2 (\u03c0))2 L(s, sym4 (\u03c0))4 L(s, \u03c0; sym6 )2\n\nL(s, sym2 (\u03c0) \u00d7 sym2 (\u03c0))L(s, sym4 (\u03c0) \u00d7 sym4 (\u03c0)).\n\nSince L(s, \u03a0f \u00d7 \u03a0f ) defines a Dirichlet series in R(s) > 1 with non-negative coefficients and has a pole of order 3 at s = 1, things appear to be in good shape, till\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\n5\n\nwe realize that one does not yet know how to prove that L(s, \u03c0; sym6 ) is holomorphic in any real interval (1 \u2212 t, 1) for a fixed t < 1. But luckily we also have the\nfactorization\nL(s, sym3 (\u03c0); sym2 ) = L(s, \u03c0; sym6 )L(s, sym2 (\u03c0)),\nwhich allows us, after exercising some care about the bad factors, to prove the\nholomorphy of the ratio L(s, \u03a0 \u00d7 \u03a0)/L(s, sym4 (\u03c0))4 in (1/2, 1). For details we refer\nto section 5.\nIn order to prove Corollary C, we begin by deducing a precise relationship between the Peterson norm of a suitably mormalized sym2 (g) (see section 6) and\nL(s, sym2 (g) \u00d7 sym2 (g)) by using the results on its integral representation due to\nJacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro and Shalika ([JPSS83], [JS90]), and an exact formula\nof E. Stade for pairs of spherical representations of GL(3, R) ([St93], [St2001]).\nMore precisely, ( sym2 (g), sym2 (g) ) differs Ress=1 L(s, sym2 (g) \u00d7 sym2 (g)) by a\nconstant factor coming from the residue of an Eisenstein series. (There should\nalso be a similar result when f is a holomorphic newform for SL(2, Z), but at this\npoint one does not appear to know enough about the archimedean zeta integral on\nGL(3)\u00d7GL(3) to achieve this.) Finally, the nonexistence of Landau-Siegel zeros for\nL(s, sym2 (g) \u00d7 sym2 (g)) allows us to bound from below its residue at s = 1, and\nthis in turn gives us, when sym2 (g) is replaced by its spectral normalization, the\ndesired bound on the first Fourier coefficient a(1, 1). For details, see Section 6.\nTo prove Theorem D we appeal to the factorization of L(s, sym4 (\u03c0); \u039b2 ) above\nas well as to the identity\nL(s, sym4 (\u03c0); sym2 ) = L(s, \u03c0; sym8 )L(s, sym4 (\u03c0))\u03b6F (s).\nFor any cuspidal automorphic representation \u03a0 of GL(n, AF ), if S denotes the\nunion of the archimedean places of F with the set of finite places where \u03a0 is\nramified, one knows by Bump-Ginzburg ([BuG92]) that the incomplete L-function\nLS (s, \u03a0; sym2 ), defined in a right half plane by the Euler product over places outside\nS, is holomorphic in (1/2, 1). Applying this with n = 4, \u03a0 = sym4 (\u03c0), and carefully\ntaking care of the factors at S, we deuce the holomorphy of the syemmetric square\nL-function of sym4 (\u03c0). Now the knowledge gained from the proof of Theorem B on\nLandau-Siegel zeros of L(s, sym4 (\u03c0)) allows us (see section 7) to prove Theorem D.\nWe would like to thank D. Bump, W. Duke, H. Jacquet, H. Kim, W. Luo,\nS. Miller, F. Shahidi and E.

It might be useful to compare this with the definition of the\nPut D =\nm\u22651\n\nSelberg class ([Mu94]). In the latter one requires in addition a Ramanujan type\nbound on the coefficients, but allows more complicated Gamma factors.\nOne says that L(s) is self-dual if L(s) = L\u2228 (s), in which case W = {\u00b11}.\nImportant examples are \u03b6(s), Dirichlet and Hecke L-functions, the L-functions\nof holomorphic newforms g of weight k \u2265 1 and level N , normalized to be\n(1.2)\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\ns + (k + 1)/2\ns + (k \u2212 1)/2\nk\u22121\n\u0393\n,\n, g), L\u221e (s) = \u03c0 \u2212s \u0393\nL(s) = L(s +\n2\n2\n2\nL-functions of cuspidal Maass forms \u03c6 of level N which are eigenfunctions of Hecke\noperators:\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\ns+\u03b4+w\ns+\u03b4\u2212w\n(1.3) L(s) = L(s, \u03c6), L\u221e (s) = \u03c0 \u2212s \u0393\n\u0393\n, \u03b4 \u2208 {0, 1},\n2\n2\nand the Rankin-Selberg L-functions L(s, f \u00d7 g), where f, g are cusp forms of holomorphic or Maass type. See the next section for their definition and generalizations.\nCall an L(s) \u2208 D primitive if it cannot be factored as L1 (s)L2 (s) with L1 (s), L2 (s)\nnon-scalar in D. The Dirichlet and Hecke L-functions, as well as those of cusp forms\non the upper half plane are primitive.\nConjecture I Every L(s) \u01eb Dm is quasi-automorphic, ie, there exists an automorphic form \u03c0 on GL(m)/Q such that Lp (s) = L(s, \u03c0p ) for almost all p. Moreover,\nL(s) is primitive iff \u03c0 is cuspidal.\nThis is compatible with Langlands philosophy ([La70]) and with the conjecture of\nCogdell and Piatetski-Shapiro ([CoPS94]); Cogdell has remarked to us recently that\nPiatetski-Shapiro has also formulated (unpublished) a similar conjecture involving\nanalogs of D. Note such a thing cannot be formulated over number fields of degree\n> 1 as one can permute the Euler factors lying over any given rational prime.\nAlso, there exists an example of Patterson over function fields F over a finite field\nFq satisfying analogous conditions, but with zeros on the lines Re(s) = 1/4 and\nRe(s) = 3/4. One problem in characteristic p is that there is no minimal global\nfield F such as Q. It is still an interesting open problem to know if one can define\na good notion of \"primitivity\" over function fields.\nConjecture II For any L(s) \u2208 D, if it has a pole of order r at s = 1, then\n\u03b6(s)r |L(s), ie., L(s) = \u03b6(s)r L1 (s), with L1 (s) \u01eb D.\nThis is compatible with the conjectures of Selberg, Tate and Langlands.\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\nDefinition 1.4 Let L(s) \u01eb Dm with L\u221e (s) = \u03c0 \u2212ms \u03a0m\nj=1 \u0393\nthickened conductor to be\nM = N (2 + \u039b)\nwhere\nm\nX\n|bj |).\n\u039b =\n\n7\n\n\u0010\n\ns+bj\n2\n\n\u0011\n.

Then we say that L(s) has a Landau-Siegel zero relative\nto c if L(\u03b2) = 0 for some \u03b2 \u2208 (1 \u2212 logcM , 1).\nDefinition 1.6 Let F be a family, by wich we will mean a class of L-functions in\nD with M \u2192 \u221e in F . We say that F admits no Landau-Siegel Zero if there exists\nan effective constant c > 0 such that no L(s) in F has a zero in (1 \u2212 logcM , 1).\nThe general expectation is framed by the following\nConjecture III Let F be a family in D. Then F admits no Landau-Siegel zero.\n\nOne reason for interest in this is that the lack of such a zero implies a good lower\nbound for L(s) at s = 1. Note that in view of Conjecture I, the Grand Riemann\nHypothesis, shortened as GRH, implies that all the non-trivial zeros of any L(s) in\nD lie on the critical line, hence it implies Conjecture III. Of course the GRH is but\na distant goal at the moment, and it is hopefully of interest to verify Conjecture\nIII for various families.\nThe L-functions of pure motives over Q, in particular those associated to the cohomology of smooth projective varieties X/Q, are expected to be automorphic and\nhence should belong to D. For these L-functions, when they are of even Frobenius\nweight, the values at s = 1 have arithmetic significance by the general Bloch-Kato\nconjectures, and so the question of non-existence of Landau-Siegel zeros is helpful\nto understand from a purely arithmetical point of view.\nWe will need the following useful (and well known) fact:\nLemma 1.7 Let L(s) \u01eb Dm be a positive Dirichlet series having a pole of order\nr \u2265 1 at s = 1, with L\u2032 (s)/L(s) < 0 for real s in (1, \u221e). Then there exists an\neffective constant C > 0, depending only on m and r, such that L(s) has most r\nreal zeros in (1 \u2212 logCM , 1).\nFor a more relaxed discussion of these matters, see the expository article [Ra99]\non the Landau-Siegel zeros, as well as the articles [GHLL94] and [HRa95].\n2. Preliminaries on automorphic L-functions\nFix a number field F with ring of integers OF , discriminant DF , and adele ring\nAF = F\u221e \u00d7 AF,f , where F\u221e is the product of the archimedean completions of F\nand the ring AF,f of finite adeles is a restricted direct product of the completions Fv\nover non-archimedean places v. For each finite v, let Ov denote the ring of integers\nof Fv .

GL(nr , AF ), Langlands's theory of Eisenstein series constructs\na so called isobaric automorphic representation ([La79]) \u03c0 of GL(n, AF ), which is\nunique by the work of Jacquet-Shalika ([JS81]), written as\n(2.1)\n\n\u03c0 := \u229eri=1 \u03c0i ,\n\nwith\nQr the property that its standard degree n L-function L(s, \u03c0) is the product\ni=1 L(s, \u03c0i ).

The associated Rankin-Selberg L-function is given as an\nEuler product of degree nm:\nY\n(2.3)\nL(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) =\nL(s, \u03c0v \u00d7 \u03c0v\u2032 ),\nv\n\nconvergent in a right half plane, with its finite part, namely L(s, \u03c0f \u00d7 \u03c0f\u2032 ), defining\na Dirichlet series. When m = 1 and \u03c0 \u2032 is the trivial representation 1, this Lfunction agrees with the standard L-function. There are two distinct methods for\ndefining these L-functions, the first using the gcds of integral representations, due to\nJacquet, Piaietski-Shapiro and Shalika ([JPSS83]), and the second via the constant\nterms of Eisenstein series on larger groups, due to Langlands and Shahidi ([Sh88,\n90]); see also [MW89]. The fact that they give the same L-functions is non-trivial\nbut true. These L-functions also admit a meromorphic continuation to the whole\ns-plane with no poles except possibly at 1 \u2212 s0 and s0 for a unique s0 \u2208 iR; such a\npole occurs iff \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2032 \u2297 |.|s0 are contragredients of each other.

Moreover,\nthe logarithmic derivative L\u2032 (s, \u03c0f \u00d7\u03c0 f )/L(s, \u03c0f \u00d7\u03c0 f ) is negative for real s in (1, \u221e).\nThe local Langlands correspondence for GL(n), proved by Harris-Taylor ([HaT2000])\nand Henniart ([He2000]) in the non-archimedean case (and proved long ago by\nLanglands in the archimedean case), gives a bijection at any place v, preserving the L- and \u03b5-factors of pairs, between irreducible admissible representations\n\u03c0v of GL(n, Fv ) and n-dimensional representations \u03c3v = \u03c3(\u03c0v ) of the extended\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\n9\n\n(resp. usual) Weil group WF\u2032 v := WFv \u00d7SL(2, C) (resp.

Then there is an effective\nconstant c \u2265 0 depending on n and r, such that L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0) has at most r real zeros\nin the interval\nJ : = {s \u2208 C|1 \u2212 c/ log M (\u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0) < R(s) < 1}.\n\nFurthermore, if L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) = L1 (s)k L2 (s) for some nice L\u2013series L1 (s) and L2 (s)\nwith k > r and L2 (s) holomorphic in (t, 1) for some fixed t \u2208 (0, 1), then L1 (s) has\nno zeros in J.\nThis provides a very useful criterion to prove the nonexistence of Landau-Siegel\nzeros in some cases. By the definition of the conductor of the L\u2013series, if we know\nthat the logarithm of the conductor of L2 (s) does not exceed some multiple of\nthe logarithm of the conductor of L1 (s), with the constant depending only on the\ndegrees of those L\u2013series and k, then we can conclude that the logarithm of the\nconductor of L1 (s) is bounded above and below by some multiples of the logarithm\nof the conductor of L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ), which will then imply that L1 (s) has no LandauSiegel zero.\nGiven any isobaric automorphic representation \u03c0 of GL(n, AF ), a finite dimensional C-representation r of (the connected dual group) GL(n, C), and a character\n\u03bc of WF , we can define the associated automorphic L-function by\nY\n(2.11)\nL(s, \u03c0; r \u2297 \u03bc) =\nL(s, r(\u03c3(\u03c0v )) \u2297 \u03bcv ),\nv\n\nand\n\u03b5(s, \u03c0; r \u2297 \u03bc) =\n\nY\nv\n\n\u03b5(s, r(\u03c3(\u03c0v )) \u2297 \u03bcv ),\n\nwhere v runs over all the places of F , \u03c0v \u2192 \u03c3(\u03c0v ) the arrow giving the local\nLanglands correspondence for GL(n)/Fv , and local factors are those attached to\nrepresentations of the (extended) Weil group ([De73]). (To be precise, in the treatment of the non-archimedean case in [De73], Deligne uses the Weil-Deligne group\nW DFv , but it is not difficult to see how its representations are in bijection with\nthose of WF\u2032 v . Also, the local \u03b5-factors depend on the choice of a non-trivial additive\ncharacter and the Haar measure, but we suppress this in our notation.) Originally,\nLanglands gave a purely automorphic definition of the local factors at almost all\nplaces, but now, thanks to [HaT2000] and [He2000], we can do better.\n\n\f10\n\nD.Ramakrishnan and S.Wang\n\nWe can also define higher analogs of the Rankin-Selberg L-functions and set, for\nany pair (\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 ) of isobaric automorphic forms on (GL(n), GL(m))/F , a pair (r, r\u2032 )\nof finite dimensional C-representations of GL(n, C), GL(m, C)), and a character \u03bc\nof WF ,\nY\n(2.11)\nL(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ; r \u2297 r\u2032 \u2297 \u03bc) =\nL(s, r(\u03c3(\u03c0v )) \u2297 r\u2032 (\u03c3(\u03c0v\u2032 )) \u2297 \u03bcv ),\nv\n\nand\n\u03b5(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ; r \u2297 r\u2032 \u2297 \u03bc) =\n\nY\nv\n\n\u03b5(s, r(\u03c3(\u03c0v )) \u2297 r\u2032 (\u03c3(\u03c0v\u2032 )) \u2297 \u03bcv ).\n\nWhen m = 1, \u03c0 \u2032 \u2243 1 and r\u2032 \u2243 1, L(s, \u03c0\u00d7\u03c0 \u2032 ; r\u2297r\u2032 \u2297\u03bc) coincides with L(s, \u03c0; r\u2297\u03bc).\n\nFor each j \u2265 1, let symj denote the symmetric j-th power of the standard representation of GL(n, C). The definition (2.11) above gives in particular the families\nof automorphic L-functions L(s, \u03c0; symj \u2297 \u03bc) and L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ; symj \u2297 symk \u2297 \u03bc) for\nisobaric automorphic representations \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 of GL(2, AF ) and idele class character \u03bc,\nwhich we may, and we will, identify (via class field theory) with a character, again\ndenoted by \u03bc, of WF . One calls L(s, \u03c0; symj ) the symmetric j-th power L-function.\n3. Some useful instances of functoriality\nHere we summarize certain known instances, which we will need, of functorial\ntransfer of automorphic forms from one group to another.\nLet \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 be cuspidal automorphic representations of GL(n, AF ), GL(m, AF ), and\nlet r, r\u2032 be C-representations of GL(n, C), GL(m, C) of dimension d, d\u2032 respectively.\nThe Langlands philosophy then predicts that there exists an isobaric automorphic\nrepresentation r(\u03c0) \u22a0 r\u2032 (\u03c0 \u2032 ) of GL(dd\u2032 , AF ) such that\n(3.1)\n\nL(s, r(\u03c0) \u22a0 r\u2032 (\u03c0 \u2032 )) = L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ; r \u2297 r\u2032 ).\n\nWhen it is known to exist, the map \u03c0 \u2192 r(\u03c0) will be called a functorial transfer\nattached to r; some also call it a lifting.This is far from being known in this generality, but nevertheless, there have been some notable instances of progress wwhich\nwe will make use of. Sometimes we do not know r(\u03c0) exists, but still one has some\ngood properties of thee relevant L-functions.\nA cuspidal automorphic representation \u03c0 is said to be dihedral iff it admits a\nself-twist by a (necessarily) quadratic character \u03b4, i.e., \u03c0 \u2243 \u03c0\u2297\u03b4. Equivalently, there\nis a quadratic extension K/F and a character \u03c7 of K, such that \u03c0 is isomorphic\nF\nto IK\n(\u03c7), the representation automorphically induced by \u03c7 from K (to F ). The\npassage from the second to the first definition is by taking \u03b4 to be the quadratic\ncharacter of F associated to K/F .\nWe will need to use the following results:\nTheorem 3.2 ([Ra2000]) Let \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 be cuspidal automorphic representations of\nGL(2, AF ). Then there exists an isobaric automorphic representation \u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 of\nGL(4, AF ) such that\nL(s, \u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 ) = L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ).\n\nMoreover, \u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 is cuspidal iff one of the following happens:\n(i) \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 are both non-dihedral and there is no character \u03bc such that \u03c0 \u2032 \u2243 \u03c0 \u2297 \u03bc;\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\n11\n\nF\n(ii) One of them, say \u03c0 \u2032 , is dihedral, with \u03c0 \u2032 = IK\n(\u03c7) for a character \u03c7 of a\nquadratic extension K, and the base change \u03c0K is cuspidal and not isomorphic\nto \u03c0K \u2297 (\u03bc \u25e6 \u03b8)\u03bc\u22121 , where \u03b8 denotes the non-trivial automorphism of K/F .\n\nNote that in case (ii), \u03c0 may or may not be dihedral, and in the latter situation,\n\u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 is cuspidal.\nQ\nIf L(s) = v Lv (s) is an Euler product, andQif T is a finite set of places, we will\nwrite LT (s) for the incomplete Euler product v\u2208T\n/ Lv (s).\nTheorem 3.3 ([GJ79] for n = 2, [PPS89] for n = 3 and [BuG92] for general n)\nLet \u03c0 be a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL(n, AF ). Let S be the union\nof the archimedean places of F with the set of finite places where \u03c0 is ramified.\nThen LS (s, \u03c0; sym2 ) admits a meromorphic continuation and is holomorphic in in\nthe real interval (1/2, 1).\n\nWhen n = 2, there is even an isobaric automorphic representation sym2 (\u03c0) of\nGL(3, AF ) such that\nL(s, sym2 (\u03c0)) = L(s, \u03c0; sym2 )\n\n(n = 2),\n\nand sym2 (\u03c0) is cuspidal iff \u03c0 is non-dihedral.\nWe are stating here only the facts which we need. The reader is urged to read\nthe articles quoted to get the full statements. The functional equation and the\nmeromorphic continuuation of the symmetric square L-functions of GL(n)/F can\nalso be deduced from the Langalnds-Shahidi method.\nTheorem 3.5 ([KSh2000], [K2000], [KSh2001]) Let \u03c0 be a cuspidal automorphic\nrepresentation of GL(2, AF ). Then for j = 3, 4, there is an isobaric automorphic\nrepresentation symj (\u03c0) such that\nL(s, symj (\u03c0)) = L(s, \u03c0; symj )\n3\n\n(j = 3, 4).\n\n2\n\nMoreover, sym (\u03c0) is cuspidal iff sym (\u03c0) is cuspidal and does not admit a selftwist by a cubic character, while sym4 (\u03c0) is cuspidal iff sym3 (\u03c0) is cuspidal and\ndoes not admit a self-twist by a quadratic character.\nA cuspidal automorphic representation \u03c0 of GL(2, AF ) is said to be tetrahedral,\nresp. octahedral, iff sym2 (\u03c0), resp. sym3 (\u03c0), is cuspidal and admits a non-trivial\nself-twist by a cubic, resp. quadratic character. We will say that \u03c0 is of solvable\npolydedral type iff it is either dihedral or tetrahedral or octahedral.\n4. Proof of Theorem A\nIn this section we will say that a pair (\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 ) of cuspidal automorphic representations of GL(2, AF ) is of general type iff we have:\n(4.1)\n(a) Neither \u03c0 nor \u03c0 is dihedral; and\n(b) \u03c0 \u2032 is not a twist of \u03c0 by a character.\nFirst we will deal with the special cases when (a) or (b) does not hold.\nSuppose (a) is satisfied, but not (b), i.e., there is a chharacter \u03bc of (the idele\nclass group of) F such that\n\u03c0 \u2032 \u2243 \u03c0 \u2297 \u03bc.\n\n\f12\n\nD.Ramakrishnan and S.Wang\n\nThen we have the decomposition\n(4.2)\n\n\u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 \u2243 (sym2 (\u03c0) \u2297 \u03bc) \u229e \u03c9\u03bc,\n\nwhere \u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 denotes the isobaric automorphic representation of GL(4, AF ) associated to (\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 ) in [Ra2000], and \u03c9 is the central character of \u03c0. In terms of\nL-functions, we have\n(4.3)\n\nL(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) = L(s, sym2 (\u03c0) \u2297 \u03bc)L(s, \u03c9\u03bc).\n\nOne knows that , since \u03c0 is non-dihdral, L(s,sym2 (\u03c0) \u2297 \u03bc) admits no Landau-Siegel\nzero. This was proved in the ground-breaking article [GHLL94] for \u03bc = 1 and \u03c0\nself-dual; the general case was taken care of by a combination of the arguments\nof [HRa95] and then [Ba97]. Besides, when \u03c9\u03bc is not self-dual, i.e., not of order\n\u2264 2, L(s, \u03c9\u03bc) admits no Siegel zero (see for example [HRa95]). Finally, it is a well\nknown classical fact that for any character \u03c7 of order \u2264 2, L(s, \u03c7) can have at most\none Siegel zero. So, putting all this together, we see that\n(4.4)\n(\u03b1) The Landau-Siegel zeros of L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 (\u03c0 \u2297 \u03bc)) coincide with those of L(s, \u03c9\u03bc),\nand\n(\u03b2) This set is empty unless \u03c9\u03bc is of order \u2264 2, in which case there is at most\none Landau-Siegel zero.\nIf F is a Galois number field (over Q) not containing any quadratic field, one knows\nby [Stk74] that the Dedekind zeta function of F has no Landau-Siegel zero. So we\nmay replace order \u2264 2 in (\u03b2) by order 2 for such F . This gives the desired assertion\nin this case, and it also brings up case (i) of Theorem A.\nNext consider the case when \u03c0 is non-dihedral, but \u03c0 \u2032 is dihedral, associated to\nF\na chaaracter \u03c7 of a quadratic extension K of F . We will write \u03c0 \u2032 = IK\n(\u03c7) and say\nthat it is automorphically induced from K to F by \u03c7. Then by the basic properties\nof base change ([AC89], [Ra2000]) we have\n(4.5)\n\nF\n\u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 \u2243 IK\n(\u03c0K \u2297 \u03c7),\n\nwhere \u03c0K denotes the base change of \u03c0 to GL(2)/K, which is cuspidal because \u03c0\nis non-dihedral. Thus by the inductive nature of L-functions, we get the following\nidentity:\n(4.6)\n\nL(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) = L(s, \u03c0K \u2297 \u03c7),\n\nBy [HRa95] we know that L(s, \u03c0K \u2297 \u03c7) does not admit any Landau-Siegel zero, and\nthis gives Theorem A in this case.\nNow suppose both \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 are both dihedral. Then \u03c0, resp. \u03c0 \u2032 , is naturally\nattached to a dihedral representation \u03c3, resp. \u03c3 \u2032 , of the global Weil group WF .\nSay, \u03c3 =IndF\nK (\u03c7), for a character \u03c7 of the Weil group of a quadratic extenssion.\nWF\n(By abuse of notation, we are writing IndF\nK instead of IndWK . Since \u22a0 corresponds\nto the usual tensor product on the Weil group side (see [Ra2000]), we have\n(4.7)\nBy Mackey,\n(4.8)\n\n\u2032\nL(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) = L(s, IndF\nK (\u03c7) \u2297 \u03c3 ).\nF\nF\n\u2032\n\u2032\nIndF\nK (\u03c7) \u2297 \u03c3 \u2243 IndK (\u03c7 \u2297 ResK (\u03c3 )),\n\nwhere ResF\nK denotes the restriction functor taking representations of WF to ones\nof WF .\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\n13\n\n\u2032\nSuppose \u03c3 \u2032 is also not induced by a character of WK . Then ResF\nK (\u03c3 ) is irre\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nducible and the base change \u03c0K is cuspidal, and since L(s, \u03c0\u00d7\u03c0 ) equals L(s, \u03c0K\n\u2297\u03c7),\nit has no Landau-Siegel zero, thanks to [HRa95].\nSo we may assume that \u03c3 \u2032 is also induced by a character \u03c7\u2032 of WK . Then\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nResF\nK (\u03c3 ) \u2243 \u03c7 \u2295 (\u03c7 \u25e6 \u03b8),\n\nwhere \u03b8 denotes the non-trivial automrophism of K/F . Plugging this into (4.8)\nand making use of the inductive nature f L-functions, we get\nL(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) = L(s, \u03c7\u03c7\u2032 )L(s, \u03c7(\u03c7\u2032 \u25e6 \u03b8)).\n\n(4.9)\n\nSo there is no Landau-Siegel zero unless \u03c7\u03c7\u2032 or \u03c7(\u03c7\u2032 \u25e6 \u03b8) is of order \u2264 2, which we\nwill asssume to be the case from now on. We have yet to show that there is at\nmost one Landau-Siegel zero , which is true (see the remarks above) if only one of\nthem has order \u2264 1. Suppose they are both of order \u2264 2. If one of them, say \u03c7\u03c7\u2032\nis trivial, then\nL(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) = \u03b6F (s)L(s, \u03bd),\n\n(4.10)\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwhere \u03bd = \u03c7\u03c7\u25e6\u03b8\n\u2032 . Note that since \u03c3 is irreduucible, \u03c7 is not equal to \u03c7 \u25e6 \u03b8.Then \u03bd\nmust be a quadratic character, and the right hand side of (4.10) evidently defines\na non-negative Dirichlet series with a pole of order 1 at s = 1. So by Lemma 1.7,\nL(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) can have at most one Landau-Siegel zero.\nIt is left to consider when \u03bc := \u03c7\u03c7\u2032 and \u03bd \u2032 are both quadratic characters. The\nargument here is well known, and we give it nly for thre sake of completeness. Notes\nthat the Dirichlet series defined by\n\n(4.11)\n\nL(s) : = \u03b6F (s)L(s, \u03bc)L(s, \u03bd)L(s, \u03bc\u03bd),\n\nhas non-negative coefficieents, meromorphic continuation and a functional equation,\nwith no pole except at s = 1, where the pole is simple; L(s) is the Dedekind\nzeta function of the biquadratic extension of F obtained as the compositum of the\nquadratic extensions cut out by \u03bc and \u03bd. Thus by applying Lemma 1.7 again,\nwe see that L(s), and hence its divisor L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) (see (4.9), has at most one\nLandau-Siegel zero.\nThis finishes the proof of Theorem A when \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 are both dihedral, bringing up\ncase (ii) when they are both defined by chracters of the same quadratic extension\nK.\nSo we may, and we will, asssume from here on that bothe (a) and (b) of (4.1)\nare satisfied. Now Theorem A will be proved if we establish the following theorem,\nwhich gives a stronger statement.\nTheorem 4.12 Let \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2032 are unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of\nGL(2, AF ),and assume that the pair (\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 ) is of general type. Then,\n(a): There is an effective absolute constant c 0 such that L(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) has no\nzero in the interval ( 1 \u2212 c/log M , 1 ).\n(b): Additionally, if \u03c0 and \u03c0\u0304 \u2032 is not twist equivalent by a product of a quadratic\nit\ncharacter and | | , then there exists an absolute effective constant c2 0 such that\n\u2032\nL(s, \u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 ) has no zero in the region\n\nwhere\n\nn\n\ns = \u03c3 + it | \u03c3 \u2264 1 \u2212 (c2 Lt )\n\n\u22121\n\no\n\n\f14\n\nD.Ramakrishnan and S.Wang\n\n4N\n\nLt = log [N (\u03c0 \u00d7 \u03c0 \u2032 ) DF4 (2 + |t| + \u039b)\n\n],\n\nwith N = [F : Q] and \u039b denoting the maximum of the infinite types of \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2032 .\nSee 1.4 for the definition of the infinite parameter \u039b. Such a result was a working\nhypothesis in the work of Moreno ([Mo]) on a n effective vesion of the strong\nmultiplicity one theorem for GL(2).\nProof. of Theorem 4.12\n(a) Put\nL = L0 .\nThen by definition of \u039b,\n(4.13)\n\nlog M = L.\n\nLet \u03c9 and \u03c9 \u2032 be the central characters of \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2032 respectively.\nSince \u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 is nondihedral, sym2 (\u03c0) and sym2 (\u03c0 \u2032 ) are cuspidal. Also, (\u03c0, \u03c0 \u2032 ) being\nof general type implies (cf. [Ra2000]) that their Rankin-Selberg product \u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 of\nGL(4, AF ) is cuspidal.\nConsider the following isobaric automorphic representation\n(4.14)\n\n\u03a0 = 1 \u229e (\u03c0 \u22a0 \u03c0 \u2032 ) \u229e (sym2 (\u03c0\u0304) \u2297 \u03c9)\n\nWrite, as usual\n\u03a0 = \u03a0\u221e \u2297 \u03a0f .\n\nNote that \u03a0 is unitary and so its contragredient \u03a0\u2228 identifies with its complex\nconjugate \u03a0\u0304.

Moreover, since sym2 (\u03c0p ) is, for any prime p, unramified because \u03c0p is, which means\nthat sym2 (\u03c0p ) is spherical at p, i.e., it admits a non-zero vector fixed by the maximal compact subgroup Kp :=GL(3, Zp ).

Take the measure\nQ\nd\u2217 y = dy/|y| on A\u2217 , where |y| = v |yv | the natural absolute value, namely the one\ngiven by |y\u221e | = sgn(y\u221e )y\u221e and |yp | = p\u2212vp (yp ) . Since the centerQZ is isomorphic\nto the multiplicative group, this definesQa Haar measure dz = v dzv on Z(A).\nOn GL(3, A) take the product measure v dxv , where each dxv is given, by using\nthe Iwasawa decomposition GL(3, Qv ) = Zv Tv Nv Kv , as dzv dtv dnv dkv . Here Tv\ndenotes the subgroup of diagonal matrices of determinant 1, with dtv being the\ntransfer of the measure d\u2217 tv via the isomorphism Tv \u2243 Fv\u2217 , Nv the unipotent upper\ntriangular group with measure dnv being the transfer of dtv via the isomorphism\nof Nv with the additive group Fv , and dkv the Haar measure on Kv noralized to\ngive total volume 1.\nThe representation sym2 (\u03c0) is a unitary summand. Since sym2 (\u03c0) is irreducible,\nsuch a \u03c6 will generate the whole space by taking linear combinations of its translates\nand closure. Note that \u03c6 is the pull back to GL(3, A) of a function \u03c60 , which is real\nanalytic by virtue of being a z-eigenfunction, on the 5-dimensional (real) orbifold\n(6.2)\n\nM : = Z(A)GL(3, Q)\\GL(3, A)/K = SL(3, Z)\\SO(3).\n\nSince \u03c6 and \u03c60 determine each other, we will by abuse of notation use the same\nsymbol \u03c6 to denote both of them.\nThe spherical function \u03c6, sometimes called a new vector, is unique only up to\nmultilication by a scalar. It is important for us to normalize it. There are two\nnatural ways to do it. The first way, called the arithmetic normalization, is to\nmake the Fourier coefficient a(1, 1) (see below) equal 1 (as for newforms on the\nupper half plane). The second way, which is what we will pursue here, is called the\nspectral normalization, and normalizes the scalar product h, i of \u03c6 with itself to be\nessentially 1.When so normalized, we will use the symbol sym2 (f ) for \u03c6. We will\nappeal to the Fourier expansions in terms of the Whittaker functions to do it. We\nbegin with the general setup.\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\n21\n\nDefinition 6.3 Let \u03c6 be automorphic form on GL(n)/Q generating a unitary, spherical, cuspidal automorphic representation \u03a0.

(Again, \u03a0 spherical means that \u03a0v admits, at\nevery place v, a non-zero vector invariant under the maximal compact (mod center)\nsubgroup Kv , which is GL(n, Zp ) when v is vp for a prime p.)\n(6.5)\n\u2022 W\u03a0,p is, for any prime p, the unique Kp -invariant function corresponding to\n\u03a0p normalized so that W\u03a0,p (e) = 1.\n\u2022 At the archimedean place,\n1\n\nW\u03a0,\u221e = C(\u03a0)\u2212 2 Wn,a ,\n\nwhere Wn,a be the normalized spherical function of infinite type a on GL(n, R)\nin the sense of Stade [St2001], and\nC(\u03a0) = L(1, \u03a0\u221e \u00d7 \u03a0\u221e ).\nDenote the function so normalized in the space of \u03a0 by the symbol \u03c6(\u03a0).\nNow let us get back to our Maass form g for SL(2, Z), with associated spherical\ncuspidal representation \u03c0, resp. sym2 (\u03c0), of GL(2, A), resp. GL(3, A). We set\n(6.6)\n\nsym2 (g) = \u03c6(sym2 (\u03c0)).\n\nSince g has level 1, one knows that \u03bb > 1/4 (in fact > 50, though we do not need\nit), so that if we write\n1 \u2212 t2\n,\n\u03bb =\n4\nthen t is a non-zero real number; so we may choose t to be positive. We have\nL(s, \u03c0\u221e ) = \u0393R (s + it)\u0393R (s \u2212 it).\nConsequently,\nL(s, sym2 (\u03c0\u221e )) = \u0393R (s + 2it)\u0393R (s)\u0393R (s \u2212 2it),\nand\nL(s, sym2 (\u03c0\u221e )\u00d7sym2 (\u03c0\u221e )) = \u0393R (s+4it)\u0393R (s+2it)2 \u0393R (s)3 \u0393R (s\u22122it)2 \u0393R (s\u22124it).\nThen, since \u0393(1 \u2212 ait) is the complex conjugate of \u0393(1 + ait) for any real a and\nsince \u0393(1) = 1, we obtain\n(6.7)\nC(sym2 (\u03c0)) = L(1, sym2 (\u03c0\u221e ) \u00d7 sym2 (\u03c0\u221e ))\n2\n4\n1\n1\n= \u03c0 \u22123 |\u0393( + 2it)| |\u0393( + it)|\n2\n2\n2\n= 1/(cosh(2\u03c0t)cosh(\u03c0t) )\n\n\f22\n\nD.Ramakrishnan and S.Wang\n\nRecall that Theorem B proves that if \u03c0 is not of solvable polyhedral type, then\nL(s, sym2 (\u03c0) \u00d7 sym2 (\u03c0)) admits no Landau-Siegel zero. To put this to use we need\nthe following\nProposition 6.8 If \u03c0 is a spherical cusipdal representation on GL(2)/Q, then \u03c0\nis not of solvable polyhedral type.\nProof of Proposition At each prime p (resp. \u221e) let \u03c3p (resp. \u03c3\u221e ) denote the\n2-dimensional representation of WQ\u2032 p (resp. WR ) associated to \u03c0p (resp. \u03c0\u221e ) by\nthe local Langlands correspondence. By the naturality of this correspondence, we\nknow that the conductors of \u03c0p and \u03c3p agree at every p.\nOn the other hand, as \u03c0 is spherical, the conductor of \u03c0, which is the product of\nthe conductors of all the \u03c0p , is trivial. This implies that for every p, the conductor\nof \u03c3p , and hence also that of symj (\u03c3p ) is trivial for any j \u2265 1. Appealing to the\nlocal correspondence again, we see that\n(6.9)\nFor any j \u2264 4, the automorphic representation symj (\u03c0) is spherical.\n\nFor the definition of conductors, for any local field k, of representations of\nGL(n, k) admitting a Whittaker model, see [JPSS79].\nAssume that \u03c0 is of solvable polyhedral type, i.e., it is either dihedral or tetrahedral or octahedral.\nRecall that if \u03c0 is dihedral, then \u03c0 is automorphically induced. i.e. there exists\nan idele class character \u03c7 of a quadratic field K s.t.\n(6.10)\n\nQ\n\u03c0 \u2243 IK\n(\u03c7).\n\nIf \u03c0 is tetrahedral, then by [KSh2000], sym2 (\u03c0) is cuspidal and moreover,\n(6.11)\n\nQ\nsym2 (\u03c0) \u2243 IK\n(\u03c7),\n\nfor some idele class character \u03c7 of some cyclic extension K of degree 3 over Q.\nIf \u03c0 is octahedral, then by [KSh2001], sym3 (\u03c0) is cuspidal and\nsym3 (\u03c0) \u2243 sym3 (\u03c0) \u2297 \u03bc,\n\nfor some quadratic Dirichlet character \u03bc. This implies, by [AC89], that\n(6.12)\n\nQ\nsym3 (\u03c0) \u2243 IK\n(\u03b7),\n\nfor some cuspidal automorphic representaton \u03b7 of GL(2, AK ), with K being the\nquadratic field associated to \u03bc.\nIn view of (6.9), it suffices to show that some symj (\u03c0) must be ramified, thus\ngiving a contradiction. Thanks to (6.10), (6.11) and (6.12), one is reduced to\nproving the following\nLemma 6.13 Let K/Q be a cyclic extension of degree l, a prime, and let \u03b7 be a\nQ\ncuspidal automorphic representation of GL(m, AK ), m \u2265 1. Then IK\n(\u03b7) is ramified\nat some p.\nOne can be much more precise than this, but this crude statement is sufficient for\nour purposes. However it should be noted that there are polyhedral rpresentations,\nfor example of holomorphic type of weight 1 for F = Q, with prime conductor.\nQ\nProof of Lemma 6.13 Put \u03a0 = IK\n(\u03b7). Since Q has class number 1, K/Q is\nramified. So there exists some prime p, and a place u of K above p, such that\nQ\nKu /Qp is ramified of degree l. The local component \u03a0p is simply IKpu (\u03b7u ), and it is\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\n23\n\nenough to check that \u03a0p must be ramified. If \u03c3u is the m-dimensional representation\nQ\n\u2032\nof WK\n, then the conductor of \u03a0p is the same as that of IndKpu (\u03c3u ). Moreover, \u03c3u\nu\nQ\n\nis semisimple and its conductor is divisible by that of IndKpu (\u03c3u\u2032 ) for any irreducible\n\u2032\nsubrespresentation \u03c3u\u2032 of WK\n. So it suffices to prove the following\nu\nSublemma 6.14 Let E/F be a cyclic ramified extension of non-archimedean\nlocal fields, and let \u03c3 be an irreducible m-dimensional representation of WE\u2032 . Then\nIndF\nE (\u03c4 ) is ramified.\nProof of Sublemma Since WE\u2032 is WE \u00d7 SL(2, C), the irreducibility hypothesis\nimplies that\n\u03c3 \u2243 \u03c4 \u2297 symj (st),\nfor some irreducible \u03c4 of WE and j \u2265 0, where st denotes the natural 2-dimensional\nrepresenation of SL(2, C). Then\n(6.14)\n\nWF\nj\nIndF\nE (\u03c3) \u2243 IndWE (\u03c4 ) \u2297 sym (st).\n\nF\nIt suffices to prove that IndW\nWE (\u03c4 ) is ramified. Recall that there is a short exact\nsequence\n\n1 \u2192 IF \u2192 WF \u2192 Z \u2192 1,\n\n(6.15)\n\nwhere IF denotes the inertia subgroup of Gal(F /F ). If Fq is the residue field of\nF and \u03c6 the Frobenius x \u2192 xq , then WF is just the inverse image of the group of\nintegral powers of the \u03c6 under the natural map\nF\n:=IndW\nWE (\u03c4 )\n\nGal(F /F ) \u2192 Gal(Fq /Fq ).\n\nSuppose \u03c1\nis unramified. Then by definition IF must act trivially,\nand since the quotient WF /IF is abelian, \u03c1 is forced to be a sum of one dimensional,\nunramified representations. For this one must have\n(i) dim(\u03c4 ) = 1; and\n(ii) \u03c4 \u03b8 \u2243 \u03c4 , with \u03b8 denoting the non-trivial automorphism of E/F .\nConsequently we have\n(6.16)\n\n[E:F ]\u22121\n\n\u03c1 \u2243 \u2295i=0\n\n\u03bd\u03b4 i ,\n\nwhere \u03bd is a character of WF extending \u03c4 and \u03b4 the character of WF associaated\nto E/F .But whatever nu is, \u03bd\u03b4 i will necessarily be ramified for some i between 0\nF\nand [E : F ] \u2212 1. Thus \u03c1 =IndW\nWE is ramified, contradicting the supposition that it\nis unramified. Done.\nWe have now proved Proposition 6.8.\nNext we need the following two lemmas.\nb(n)\nLemma 6.17 Let L(s) = \u03a3\u221e\nn=1 ns be an L-series with nonnegative coefficients,\nwith b(1) = 1.

Then there exist absolute\nconstants A and B such that\n1\nA\nB\nL( + i\u03b3) \u2264 (\u03bb + 1) (|\u03b3| + 1)\n2\nProof.\nNote that, for any prime p, as \u03c0p is unramified, the p-part of L(s) is the reciprocal\nof a polynomial in p\u2212s of degree 9. Let \u03b1p , \u03b2p be the coefficients of the Satake\nrepresentation of \u03c0p . Note that we assume that \u03c0 is self-dual, thus\n(6.19)\n\nLp (s)\n\n\u22121\n\n2\n\n2\n\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b14p p\u2212s )(1 \u2212 \u03b2p4 p\u2212s )(1 \u2212 \u03b12p p\u2212s ) (1 \u2212 \u03b2p2 p\u2212s ) (1 \u2212 p\u2212s )\n\n3\n\nNow apply classical bound |\u03b1p | < p1/4 , |\u03b1p | < p1/4 on the coefficients; we know a\nmuch stronger bound now (cf. [K], Appendix 2), but the 1/4 bound suffices for us.\nThen L(s) is bounded by an absolute constant on the line R(s) = 2. Also, L(s)\nsatisfies a functional equation relating s and 1 \u2212 s. Thus, we get a bound for L(s)\non the line R(s) = \u22121. We claim that the ratio of gamma factors arising from the\nfunctional equation is bounded by a certain fixed power of \u03bb and the imaginary\npart of s. In fact, the constants giving the infinite type of L(s) are all imaginary as\n\u03bb > 50 for Maass forms of kevel 1. (The constants are real or purely imaginary, and\nthe latter happens iff \u03bb \u2265 1/4, which is a difficult open problem for Maass forms\nof higher level.). Moreover, the self-duality of \u03c0 implies that the constant set is\nsymmetric about the real axis. So, the norm of the ratio of the gamma factors is a\n\u0393(1+it)\n| where t involves the imaginary\nproduct of a constant and some terms of | \u0393(\u2212\n1\n2 \u2212it)\npart of s and the constants (of the infinity type). Note that\n(6.20)\n\n3\n\u0393(1 + it)\n\u0393(1 + it)\n=\n= |t| 2 (1 + O(t\u22121 )),\n1\n1\n\u0393(\u2212 2 \u2212 it)\n\u0393(\u2212 2 + it)\n\nsince for a \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 b we have the estimation.\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u03c3\u22121/2\n(6.21)\n|\u0393(s)| = 2\u03c0e\u2212 2 |t|\n(1 + O(t\u22121 ))\n\nwhere the implied constant depends only on a and b. Hence the claim.\nAs \u03c0 is spherical, so is sym4 (\u03c0). Hence we get\n(6.22)\n\nA\n\nB\n\nL(\u22121 + i\u03b3) << (\u03bb + 1) (|\u03b3| + 1)\n\nfor certain constants A and B. Applying the Phragmen-Lindel\u00f6f principle in the\nstrip \u22121 \u2264 R(s) \u2264 2, we see that the same bound applies also on the line R(s) = 12 .\nThe following proposition sets up the relationship between the Peterson norm of\nthe normalized automorphic function sym2 (g) and the residue of a certain L-series\nat s = 1.\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\n25\n\n\u2217\nDenote ZQ\nn (A) the center of GL(n, A).

It appears that such a result has also been obtained\nby Jacquet and Shalika in the spherical case. In the non-spherical case, they can\nprove only that the L-factor is a fiite linear combination of such integrals.\nThus I is in fact the same as the quotient of the complete L-series for \u03a0 \u00d7 \u03a0 by\nL(1, \u03a0\u221e \u00d7 \u03a0\u221e ).

Consequently,\n1\n(6.36)\na(1, 1) : = a(1, 1)(sym2 (g)spec ) =\n,\n||sym2 (g)||\nand\n|a(1, 1)|2 hsym2 (g) , sym2 (g)i = 1.\nHence the bound on |a(1, 1)| follows from the bound proved above for hsym2 (g) , sym2 (g)i.\nDone.\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\n27\n\n7. Proof of Theorem D\nLet \u03c0 be a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL(2, AF ) of trivial central\ncharacter. Denote by S the union of the set S\u221e of archimedean places of FQ\nwith the\nset of finite places where \u03c0 is ramified. Given any Euler product L(s) = v Lv (s)\nover F , we will write LS (s) to mean the (incomplete Euler) product of Lv (s) over\nall v outside S.\nNext recall (see section 3) that for every j \u2264 4, there is an isobaric auutomorphic\nrepresentation symj (\u03c0) of GL(j+1, AF ), established long ago for j = 2 by S. Gelbart\nand H. Jacquet [GJ77], and very recently for j = 3, resp. j = 4, by H. Kim and F.\nShahidi ([KSh2000]), resp. H. Kim ([K2000]), such that\nL(s, symj (\u03c0)) = L(s, \u03c0, symj ).\nLemma 7.1 Let T be any finite set of places. Then we have the following factorizations of incomplete L-functions:\n(i)\n\nLT (s, sym3 (\u03c0), sym2 ) = LT (s, \u03c0, sym6 )LT (s, sym2 (\u03c0))\n\nand\n(ii)\n\nLT (s, sym4 (\u03c0), sym2 ) = LT (s, \u03c0, sym8 )LT (s, sym4 (\u03c0))\u03b6FT (s).\n\nProof It suffices to prove these locally at every place otside T . But at any v,\nwe have by definition,\n(7.2)\n\nL(s, sym3 (\u03c0v ), sym2 ) = L(s, \u039b2 (sym4 (\u03c3v ))),\n\nand\nL(s, sym4 (\u03c0v ), sym2 ) = L(s, sym2 (sym4 (\u03c3v ))),\nwhere \u03c3v is the 2-dimensional representation of WFv , resp. WF\u2032 v , associated to \u03c0v\nby the local correspondence for v archimedean, resp. non-archimedean. By the\nClebsch-Gordon identities, we have\n(7.3)\nand\n\nsym2 (sym3 (\u03c3v )) \u2243 sym6 (\u03c3v ) \u2295 sym2 (\u03c3v ),\n\nsym2 (sym4 (\u03c3v )) \u2243 sym8 (\u03c3v ) \u2295 sym4 (\u03c3v ) \u2295 1.\nThe assertion of the Lemma now follows.\nLemma 7.4 Let \u03c0 be a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL(2, AF ) with\ntrivial central character, and let v be a place where \u03c0v is a ramified, non-tempered\nprincipal series representatin. Then sym4 (\u03c0) is unramified at v.\nProof.\nAs \u03c0v is a ramified principal series representation of trivial central\ncharacter, we must have\n(7.5)\n\n\u03c0v \u2243 \u03bcv \u229e \u03bc\u22121\nv ,\n\nfor a ramified (quasi-)character \u03bcv of Fv\u2217 . Since \u03c0v is non-tempered, we may write,\nafter possibly interchnging \u03bcv and \u03bc\u22121\nv ,\n(7.6)\n\n\u03bcv = \u03bdv |.|tv ,\n\nfor a unitary character \u03bdv of Fv\u2217 and a real number t > 0. (|.|v denotes as usual\nthe normalizeed absolute value on Fv .) On the other hand, the unitarity of \u03c0v says\n\n\f28\n\nD.Ramakrishnan and S.Wang\n\nthat its complex conjugate representation \u03c0 v is isomorphic to the contragredient\n\u03c0v\u2228 . This forces the identity\n\u03bdv = \u03bd v .\nSince \u03bdv is unitary, we get\n(7.7)\nwhere\n\n\u03bdv2 = 1\n\nand \u03c0v \u2243 \u03bdv \u2297 \u03c0v0 ,\n\n\u03c0v0 \u2243 |.|tv \u229e |.|\u22121\nv .\nThen the associated 2-dimensional Weil group representation \u03c3v is of the form\n\u03bdv \u2297 \u03c3v0 , with \u03c3v0 corresponding to \u03c0v0 . Moreover, since \u03bdv is quadratic, we have for\nany j \u2265 1,\n(7.8)\n\nsym2j (\u03c3v ) \u2243 sym2j (\u03c3v0 ),\n\nwhich is unramified. Since by [K2000], sym4 (\u03c0)v corresponds to sym4 (\u03c3v ) (at every\nplace v), we see that it must be unramified as claimed.\nLemma 7.9 Let \u03c0 be a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL(2, AF ), and v a\nplace of F where \u03c0v is tempered. Then for any j \u2265 1, the local factor L(s, \u03c0v , symj )\nis holomorphic in R(s) > 1/2 except for a possible pole at s = 1..\n\nProof.\nIf v is archimedean, or if v is finite but \u03c0v is not special, \u03c0v corresponds to a 2-dimensional representation \u03c3v of the local Weil group WFv . The\ntemperedness of \u03c0v implies that \u03c3v has bounded image in GL(2, C). Then for any\nfinite-dimensional C-representation r of dimension N , in particular for symj , of\nGL(2, C), the image of r(\u03c3v ) will be bounded, and this implies that the admissible,\nirreducible representation \u03a0v of GL(N, Fv ), associated to r(\u03c3v ) by the local Langlands correspondence, is tempered. Then L(s, \u03a0v ) is holomorphic in R(s) > 1/2\nexcept for a possible pole at s = 1 (see [BaR94]). (One can also prove directly,\nusing the extension in [De73] of Brauer's theorem to the representations of WFv ,\nthat L(s, r(\u03c3v ) has the requisite property.) We are now done in this case because\nL(s, \u03c0v ; symj ) is defined to be L(s, symj (\u03c3v )).\nSo we may take v to be finite and assume that \u03c0v is a special representaton\nsp(\u03bcv ) (see [HRa95], setion 2 for notation), associated to the partition 2 = 1 + 1\nand a (unitary) character \u03bcv of Fv\u2217 . Then the associated \u03c3v is of the form (w, g) \u2192\n\u03bcv (w) \u2297 g, for all w in WFv and g in SL(2, C). So we have\nsymj (\u03c3v ) \u2243 \u03bcjv \u2297 symj ,\n\nwhich corresponds to the special representation sp(\u03bcjv ) of GL(j + 1, Fv ) associated\nto the partition j + 1 = 1 + . . . + 1 and the character \u03bcjv . Now we may appeal to\nthe fact (see [BaR94]) that for any unitary character \u03bdv , the function L(s, sp(\u03bdv ))\nis holomorphic in R(s) > 0.\nHaving established these preliminary lemmas, we are ready to begin the proof of\nTheorem D. Let S denote the union of the archimedean places of F with the set of\nfinite places v where \u03c0v is ramified and tempered. In view of Lemma 7.9, it suffices\nto show the following\nProposition 7.10 The incomplete L-function LS (s, \u03c0; sym6 ) is holomorphic in\nthe real interval (1 \u2212 logcM , 1) for a positive, effective constant c independent of\n\u03c0, with M denoting the thickened conductor of \u03c0. The same result holds for the\n\n\fExceptional zeros of Rankin-Selberg L-functions\n\n29\n\nsymmetric 8th power L-function if F is a Galois extension of Q not containing any\nquadratic extension of Q.\nProof. When \u03c0 is of solvable polyhedral type, the results of Kim and Shahidi in\n[Ksh2001] imply that LS (s, \u03c0; symj ) is holomorphic in (1/2, 1) for any j \u2264 9. So we\nmay assume that we are not in this case, so that sym4 (\u03c0) is a cuspidal automorphic\nrepresentation of GL(5, AF ).\nBy the definition of S, given any place v outside S, \u03c0v is either unramified or\na ramified, non-tempered principal series representation. Thanks to Lemma 7.4,\nsym4 (\u03c0v ) is unramified in either case. So we may appeal to the work of BumpGinzburg ([BuG92]) on the symmetric square L-fnctions, we get the holomorphy in\n(1/2, 1) of the incomplete L-functions LS (s, sym4 (\u03c0); \u039b2 ) and LS (s, sym4 (\u03c0); sym2 ).\nNext we appeal to the identities of Lemma 7.1 with T = S. The assertion\nof the Proposition is then clear for the symmetric 6-th power L-function since\nLS (s, sym2 (\u03c0)) admits no Landau-Siegel zero by [GHLL94]. So let us turn our\nattention to the (incomplete) symmetric 8-th power L-function of \u03c0. It suffices, by\nthe identity (ii) of Lemma 7.1, that it suffices to show that LS (s, sym4 (\u03c0))\u03b6FS (s)\nadmits no Landau-Siegel zero. Since F is by hypothesis a Galois extension of Q\nnot containing any quadratic field, one knows by Stark ([St]) that \u03b6FS (s) admits no\nLandau-Siegel zero. So we are finally done by our proof of Theorem B, where we\nshowed that LS (s, sym4 (\u03c0)) admits no Landau-Siegel zero. Strictly speaking, we\nshowed it for the full L-function. But the local factors at S, being tempered, do\nnot have any pole in (1/2, 1).\n\nBibliography\n[AC89]: J. Arthur and L.
