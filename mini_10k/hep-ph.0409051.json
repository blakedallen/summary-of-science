The work suggests that the two-step process, in which the primary qq pair forms\nfirst a vector meson which in turn decays into a hadron pair, is dominant over the one-step process\nin which the primary qq pair is directly dressed by additional qq pairs to form a hadron pair. To\nreproduce the experimental data of the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn and pp a D-wave \u03c9-like vector meson\nwith a mass of around 2 GeV has to be introduced.\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nExperimental data on the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn from the FENICE collaboration [1], earlier\n\ndata on the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp from the FENICE and DM2 collaborations [2] and also data\ncollected at the LEAR antiproton ring at CERN on the time-reversed reaction pp \u2192 e+ e\u2212 [3]\nwhich are summarized in FIG.1 indicate a ratio \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn)/\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp) > 1 at energies\n\naround the N N threshold with Ec.m. \u223c 2 GeV. Averaging over the available data on both\nthe direct and time-reversed reactions, one finds [4]\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp)\n= 0.66+0.16\n\u22120.11 .\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn)\n\n(1)\n\nIn a naive perturbative description of e+ e\u2212 annihilation into baryons the virtual timelike photon first decays into a qq pair, then the qq pair is dressed by two additional quarkantiquark pairs excited out of the vacuum to form a baryon pair. The dressing process\ndoes not distinguish between u and d quarks at high momentum transfers since in the\ndescription of perturbative QCD the gluon couplings are flavor blind. In the conventional\nperturbative picture the only difference between the proton and neutron production arises\nfrom the different electric charges of the primary qq pairs. One expects to get\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp)\n>1\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn)\n\n(2)\n\nat large momentum transfers where the u quark contribution dominates in the proton and\nthe d quark in the neutron.\nThe reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 N N at energies around the N N threshold is highly nonperturbative, hence the problem must be tackled in a nonperturbative manner. In this work we model\nthe reactions by the nonperturbative 3 P0 quark dynamics which describes quark-antiquark\nannihilation and creation. It was shown that the 3 P0 approach is phenomenologically successful in the description of hadronic couplings [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nThe reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 NN may arise from two different processes: (1) the primary qq\npair is dressed directly by two additional quark-antiquark pairs created out of the vacuum\nto form a baryon pair; and (2) the primary qq pair forms a virtual vector meson first, then\nthe virtual vector meson decays into a baryon pair. We expect that the second process is\ndominant over the first because of the considerable success of the vector dominance model.\nHowever, it is difficult to extract a solid conclusion by studying the reaction itself since\n2\n\n\f2.0\n\n\u03c3 (nbarn)\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\nE (GeV)\n\nFIG. 1: Comparison of the cross sections for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn at the N N threshold\nregion. The solid circles [2] and triangles [3] are for the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp while the squares [1]\nare for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn.\n\nthere are only very limited experimental data available and the effective strength of the\nquark-antiquark vertex may vary largely from one process to another. We therefore study\nfirst a much simpler process, the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , where a large number of high\nquality data are available. The work is arranged as follows: In Sec. II we study the reaction\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 with the parameters determined in the reactions \u03c10 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 and \u03c10 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .\n\nThe reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 NN is studied in Sec. III in the two-step process described above.\n\nWe give our conclusions in Sec. IV. In Appendices A and B we discuss the calculations of\nthe transition amplitudes \u03c10 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and V \u2192 N N in the 3 P0 model.\nII.\n\nREACTION e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\n\nThe reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 may arise in the valence quark dominated picture from the\n\nfollowing process: the e+ e\u2212 pair annihilates into a virtual time-like photon, the virtual\nphoton decays into a qq pair, and finally the qq pair is dressed by an additional quarkantiquark pair created out of the vacuum to form a meson pair, as shown in FIG.2a.

Vqq is\nthe effective vertex for creation and destruction of a quark-antiquark pair in quark models,\nwhich is identified in the context of the 3 P0 quark-antiquark dynamics. At an energy scale\nof about 1 GeV the intermediate quark-antiquark state can be assumed to be saturated by\nthe \u03c10 (770) resonance, depicted in FIG.2b, as in the context of the vector dominance model.\nWe refer to this process as the two-step reaction, whereas the former, more general one, is\nthe one-step reaction. The corresponding transition amplitude then takes the form\nT2 = h\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 |Vqq |\u03c1ih\u03c1|G|\u03c1ih\u03c1|qqihqq|T |e+ e\u2212 i\n\n(4)\n\nwhere h\u03c1|qqi is simply the wave function of the intermediate meson \u03c1, h\u03c1|G|\u03c1i the Green\n\nfunction describing the propagation of the intermediate meson, and h\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 |Vqq |\u03c1i the transition amplitude of \u03c10 annihilation into a \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pair.\n\nThe size parameter of the \u03c1 meson associated with its wave function may be determined\nby studying the reaction \u03c10 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 . The transition amplitude of a vector meson annihilation\n4\n\n\finto an electron-positron pair takes the general form\nT = he+ e\u2212 |T |qqihqq|V i\n\n(5)\n\nwhere |V i is the vector meson state (see Appendix A), and he+ e\u2212 |T |qqi the transition\namplitude of a quark-antiquark pair to an electron-positron pair. The transition amplitude\ncan be evaluated by a standard method as for example outlined in [10]. One has\nhe+ e\u2212 |T |qqi = \u2212\n\neq e\nue (pe\u2212 , me\u2212 )\u03b3 \u03bc ve (pe+ , me+ ) vq (pq , mq )\u03b3\u03bc uq (pq , mq )\ns\n\n(6)\n\nwhere s = (pq + pq )2 , eq is the charge of quarks, and the Dirac spinors are normalized\naccording to uu = vv = 2m. In the small quark momentum approximation, the decay width\nfor the transition of a vector meson to an electron-positron pair can be easily evaluated.\nOne has\n\u0393\u03c10 \u2192e+ e\u2212 =\n\n16\u03c0\u03b12 Q2\n|\u03c8(0)|2\n2\nMV\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Q2 is the squared sum of the charges of the quarks in the meson, with Q2 = 1/2 for\n\u03c1, 1/18 for \u03c9 and 1/9 for \u03c6, and \u03c8(0) = 1/(\u03c0b2 )3/4 is the coordinate space wave function\nof the vector meson at the origin. Using as an input M\u03c1 = 0.7758 GeV, \u03b1 = 1/137 and\nthe experimental value of \u0393\u03c10 \u2192e+ e\u2212 = 7.02 \u00b1 0.11 KeV, we get b = 3.847 GeV\u22121 for the size\nparameter of the \u03c1 meson with the spatial wave function set up in the harmonic oscillator\napproximation (see details in Appendix A). The size parameter b in Eq.

F\u0302ij and \u0108ij are the flavor and color operators projecting\na quark-antiquark pair to the respective vacuum quantum numbers. The derivation and\ninterpretation of the quark-antiquark 3 P0 dynamics may be found in literature [5, 6].\nThe decay width of the reaction \u03c10 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 takes the form\n\u0393\u03c10 \u2192\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 =\n\n\u03c0\n4\n\nv\nu\nu\n2t\nM\n1\u2212\n\u03c1\n\n5\n\n4M\u03c02\n|T\u03c10 \u2192\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 |2 ,\n2\nM\u03c1\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere T\u03c10 \u2192\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 is the corresponding transition amplitude defined in the center-of-mass\nsystem. Substituting T\u03c10 \u2192\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 as calculated in our approach (see Appendix A) we get\n\u0393\u03c10 \u2192\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 = \u03bb\n\n2\n\n\u0012 \u00137\n\n\u221a\n\n2\n3\n\nwhere M\u03c1 is the mass of \u03c1 meson and k =\n\n1\n\n2 k2\n\n\u03c0M\u03c1 (bk)3 e\u2212 6 b\n\n(10)\n\nq\n\nM\u03c12 /4 \u2212 M\u03c02 the momentum of the outgoing\n\npions. The result obtained here is consistent with the ones of Refs. [5, 11, 12], the different\nmagnitude of the strength parameter \u03bb just depends on the different normalization of the 3 P0\nvertex. With the size parameter b = 3.847 GeV\u22121 determined from the reaction \u03c10 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ,\n\nthe experimental value \u0393 = 150 MeV for the decay width of \u03c10 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 requires the\neffective strength parameter \u03bb to take the value \u03bb = 0.98 . In [11], the size parameter b is\ntaken to be 2.5 GeV\u22121 and the effective strength is fitted to be 0.39, which according to our\nnormalization corresponds to \u03bb = 0.96.\nBased on the evaluations for the reactions \u03c10 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c10 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 , it is straightforward to work out the transition amplitude of the two step diagram shown in FIG.2b in the\nreaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nTe+ e\u2212 \u2192\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 = T\u03c10 \u2192\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212\n\n1\nTe+ e\u2212 \u2192\u03c10 .\nE \u2212 M\u03c1\n\n(11)\n\nThe transition amplitude for the process \u03c1 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 is\nT\u03c1\u2192e+ e\u2212 = he+ e\u2212 |T |qqihqq|V i =\n\nZ\n\nd~pq d~pq\n\u03b4(~pq + ~pq ) \u03c8\u03c1 (~pq , p~q ) Tqq\u2192e+ e\u2212 (~pq , p~q ) (12)\n(2\u03c0)3/2 2Eq\n\nwhere \u03c8\u03c1 is the wave function of the \u03c1 meson in momentum space, and Tqq\u2192e+ e\u2212 is given in\nEq.

The delta function \u03b4(~pq + p~q ) indicates that we work in the \u03c1 meson rest frame.\nNote that only the P -wave contributes to the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 since the spin of the\nintermediate \u03c1 is 1. Furthermore, there is no free parameter since the size and the effective\nstrength parameters have been determined by the processes \u03c10 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 and \u03c10 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ,\nrespectively.\nIn FIG.3 we give the prediction for the cross section of the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in the\n\nmodel for the two step process. The result seems to indicate that the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\n\nis completely dominated by the intermediate vector meson. One may therefore conclude\nthat the one step process is completely saturated by the relevant resonances entering at this\nenergy scale.\n\n6\n\n\f\u03c3 (nb)\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nEcm (GeV)\nFIG. 3: Theoretical prediction (solid line) in the two-step model shown in FIG.2b for the cross\nsection of the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 compared with experimental data taken from [13, 14]\nIII.\n\nREACTION e+ e\u2212 \u2192 N N\n\nIn the following we assume that the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 N N is described by a two-step\n\nprocess, just as for the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . This is again consistent with the vector\ndominance model.\n\nHere we study the two-step process shown in FIG.4: the e+ e\u2212 pair annihilates into a\nvirtual time-like photon, the photon decays into a qq pair, the qq pair forms a virtual vector\nmeson, finally the virtual vector meson is dressed by two additional quark-antiquark pairs\ncreated out of the vacuum to form a baryon pair. The meson \u03c1(2150) with the quantum\nnumber I G (J P C ) = 1+ (1\u2212\u2212 ) is a good candidate [15] for such an intermediate state.

The energy scale\n\nof the intermediate q 2 q\u0304 2 state in the V \u2192 N N\u0304 transition is simply set by associating in\naverage an equal share of the total energy to each valence quark involved.\nConsidering that both isospin I = 0 and 1 vector mesons could be the intermediate states\nfor the reaction e+ e\u2212 \u2192 N N, we have the transition amplitudes\n1\nTe+ e\u2212 \u2192pp = \u221a [T (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 V (I = 1) \u2192 N N) + T (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 V (I = 0) \u2192 NN)]\n2\n1\nTe+ e\u2212 \u2192nn = \u221a [T (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 V (I = 1) \u2192 N N) \u2212 T (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 V (I = 0) \u2192 NN)] (14)\n2\nfor the reactions e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn, respectively. It is clear that the cross sections\n\nof the reactions e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn would be the same if either a single isospin 0 or\nisospin 1 vector meson dominates the intermediate state at this energy scale. However, the\nexperimental ratio of Eq. (1) indicates that at least two vector mesons with isospin 0 and 1\nare involved as intermediate states. In addition to the confirmed vector meson \u03c1(2150), there\nare clues [18, 19] for the existence of an \u03c9-like meson lying in the energy region near the N N\nthreshold. The vector meson with isospin 0 has mass and width of about 2150 MeV and 220\nMeV, respectively. The contribution of the \u03c9(2150) as well as the \u03c1(2150) are included in\nour calculation. The mesons \u03c1(2150) and \u03c9(2150) are assumed to be superpositions of 3S\nand 2D states, considering that the lower lying states have been occupied ( see Table I).\n8\n\n\f4\n\n\u03c3 (nb)\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c3pp / \u03c3nn\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\nS/S+D\n\nFIG. 5: Model predictions for the cross sections of the reactions e\u2212 e+ \u2192 nn (dashed line in\nthe upper figure) and e\u2212 e+ \u2192 pp (solid line in the upper figure) and for the ratio \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192\npp)/\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn) (in the lower figure) versus the S-wave probability of the meson \u03c1(2150).\n\nTABLE I: \u03c1 and \u03c9 mesons coming in pairs\n1S\n\n\u03c1(770)\n\n\u03c9(782)\n\n2S\n\n\u03c1(1450) \u03c9(1420)\n\n1D\n\n\u03c1(1700) \u03c9(1650)\n\n3S or 2D \u03c1(2150) \u03c9(2150) ?\n\n9\n\n\fIt is found in our study that the experimental data suggest a \u03c9(2150) being in a D wave,\nand prefer the \u03c1(2150) meson as a mixture of S and D waves. It may be interesting to\nmention that the work [12], which studied the decay of higher quarkonia in the 3 P0 quark\nmodel, reveals that the lower energy counterparts \u03c1(1450) and \u03c1(1700) of the meson \u03c1(2150)\nare likely to be mixtures of 2S or 1D states.\nPresented in FIG.5 are the predictions of the present model for the total cross sections\nof the reactions e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn at the NN threshold, with the \u03c9(2150) in the\n2D state and the \u03c1(2150) varying from the 2D state to the 3S state. Note that, except the\nparameters describing the S and D wave admixture in the mesons \u03c1(2150) and \u03c9(2150),\nthere are no more free parameters. For the size parameter we employ b = 3.847 GeV\u22121\nas already fixed in the reaction \u03c10 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 , the 3 P0 strength with \u03bb = 0.98 is fixed in the\n\nreaction \u03c10 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The size parameter of the nucleon with a = 3.1 GeV\u22121 is fixed from\nother considerations [6, 20], and the masses and widths of the mesons \u03c1(2150) and \u03c9(2150)\nare taken from [15, 18, 19]. The energy denominator of the intermediate q 2 q\u0304 2 state \u2206E is\nroughly approximated as \u2206E = Ec.m. /3 , assuming that the reaction energy Ec.m. is shared\nby the six quarks equally [16, 17].\nWith \u03c9(2150) in the 2D state and \u03c1(2150) half in the 3S and half in the 2D state, we\nget\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp) \u2248 0.65 nb ,\n\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn) \u2248 0.76 nb\n\n(15)\n\nand hence\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp)\n\u2248 0.85\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn)\n\n(16)\n\nThe model results for the cross sections of Eq. (15) are sensitive to the length parameters\nb and a and the effective parameter \u03bb. However, the ratio \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp)/\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn)\nis of course independent of the strength parameter and rather independent of the length\nparameters involved.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe puzzling experimental result that \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 pp)/\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 nn) < 1 can be understood in the framework of a phenomenological nonrelativistic quark model. All parameters\n10\n\n\femployed in the model, except the ones describing the mixture of the S and D waves for\nthe intermediate vector mesons \u03c1(2150) and \u03c9(2150), are not free but determined by other\nreactions.\nThe experimental data suggest the existence of a D-wave \u03c9 meson with a mass of about\n2100 MeV. The conclusion is quite general, independent of the special values of the size\nparameters a, b and the 3 P0 strength \u03bb.\n\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT)\nunder Grant No. 1.CH7/2545 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under\nGrant Nos. 19975074 and 10275096, by the DFG under contracts FA67/25-3 and GRK683.\nThis research is also part of the EU Integrated Infrastructure Initiative Hadronphysics\nproject under contract number RII3-CT-2004-506078 and President grant of Russia \"Scientific Schools\" No. 1743.2003.\n\nAPPENDIX A: TRANSITION \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 IN 3 P0 MODEL\n\nWe study the reaction \u03c1 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 shown in FIG.6 to determine the effective strength\n\nparameter \u03bb in the quark-antiquark 3 P0 vertex of Eq.
