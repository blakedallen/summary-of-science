Anisotropic heat transport measurement in\nBi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 reveals that the quasiparticle populations are different for the two nodal directions\nand thus the gap structure must be uniquely anisotropic, suggesting that pairing is governed by\ninteractions with a rather complicated anisotropy. Intriguingly, it is found that the \"plateau\" in the\nmagnetic-field dependence of the thermal conductivity is observed only in the b-axis transport.\nPACS numbers: 74.25.Fy, 74.20.Rp, 74.72.Hs\n\nIt has been established [1] that in the high-Tc cuprates\nthe superconducting gap \u2206 has essentially the dx2 \u2212y2\nsymmetry, \u2206(k) = \u22060 cos 2\u03c6, which is depicted in Fig. 1\n(\u22060 is the maximum gap and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle).\nAlthough this information is very important, it does not\nhelp much in clarifying the high-Tc mechanism, because\nall of the proposed theories of the high-Tc superconductivity have successfully adopted the d-wave symmetry. It\nis thus important to obtain more detailed information on\nthe gap structure, because any deviation from the simple\ndx2 \u2212y2 symmetry would point to the role of a particular\ninteraction in the paring. However, not much is known\nabout the precise gap structure of the high-Tc cuprates\n[2], partly because the experimental techniques to selectively probe the nodal structures are limited [3].\nThe most prominent feature of the d-wave gap is that\nit has four nodes where the gap magnitude vanishes. At\nfinite temperature below Tc , quasiparticles (QPs) are always thermally excited near these nodes from the superconducting condensate; how many QPs are excited depends on the \"slope\" of the gap at the node [4], because\na steeper gap allows less phase space available below a\ngiven energy of kB T . Since these QPs carry heat (in contrast to the Cooper pairs that do not carry heat), one can\ninvestigate the gap structure of unconventional superconductors by measuring the QP heat transport in the superconducting state [5]. Moreover, because the QPs can\nonly travel along the nodal directions [5], one can gain\ninformation about different nodes by tuning the direction\nof the heat current to the respective nodal directions; this\nmakes it possible to study the detailed anisotropy of the\ngap structure in high-Tc cuprates.\nIn recent years, the heat transport has been conveniently used to probe the gap structure of the high-Tc\ncuprates. For example, it was reported [6, 7] that the inplane thermal conductivity showed a four-fold-symmetric\nchange when the heat current was fixed along an antinodal direction and an applied magnetic field was 360\u25e6 rotated in the CuO2 plane, giving maxima for fields parallel\nto the nodal directions.

The\nheat transport measurement was also employed in an intriguing proposal of a field-induced transition in the gap\nstructure; namely, Krishana et al. reported [8] that at\nlow temperatures the magnetic-field (H) dependence of\nthe thermal conductivity of Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 (BSCCO)\nshowed a \"plateau\" in high fields, and they proposed that\nthis plateau region may correspond to a fully-gapped\nstate where there are no QPs to carry heat. This experiment attracted a lot of attention because the fieldinduced phase transition in the superconducting state has\na significant implication on the mechanism of the superconductivity; however, the origin of the plateau, as well\nas the reproducibility of the experimental result, are currently under intense debate (see Ref. [9] and references\ntherein).

(a) Resistivity shows a very small, if any, in-plane anisotropy, indicating\nthat the electronic properties are essentially isotropic in the\nnormal state. (b) Thermal conductivity \u03ba shows a peculiar\nin-plane anisotropy below Tc that suggests a difference in the\nQP populations along the two nodal directions.\n\nanisotropy in the superconducting gap symmetry.\nWe measure the thermal conductivity \u03ba of high-quality\nBSCCO single crystals using a conventional steady-state\ntechnique [9, 10]. The crystals used here are grown by the\nfloating-zone (FZ) technique [11] and are annealed to be\nslightly underdoped (zero-resistance Tc is 90.5 K); their\ncrystallographic axes are determined by the X-ray Laue\nanalysis within the accuracy of a few degrees. To obtain\nreliable data on the in-plane anisotropy, we cut a piece\nof high-quality single-domain crystal into three parts and\nmeasure the a and b axis transports separately [Fig. 1(c)];\nboth the resistivity (\u03c1a and \u03c1b ) and the thermal conductivity (\u03baa and \u03bab ) are measured on the same samples.\nNote that in BSCCO the a and b crystallographic axes\nare along the nodal directions [Fig. 1(a)]. The magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the ab plane and\nthe H-dependence of \u03ba is measured with the field-cooled\nprocedure [9] to avoid complications that are associated\nwith the vortex-pinning-related hysteresis [12].\nFigure 2 displays the temperature dependences of \u03c1\nand \u03ba for the a and b directions; the resistivity shows\nonly a small, if any, in-plane anisotropy, while the thermal conductivity demonstrates a non-trivial anisotropy\nthat cannot be attributed to an error in the geometrical\nfactors; namely, the peak height at \u223c70 K is smaller along\nthe a axis and yet \u03baa becomes larger than \u03bab below \u223c30\n\nFIG. 3: Magnetic-field dependences of the anisotropic thermal conductivity at (a) 12.5 K and (b) 10 K. The \"plateau\"\nis observed only for the b direction. The data are normalized\nby the values in zero field. (At 12.5 K, \u03baa and \u03bab are 2.07 and\n1.96 W/Km; at 10 K, \u03baa and \u03bab are 1.96 and 1.81 W/Km).\n\nK. This anisotropy in \u03ba(T ) suggests that the number of\nthermally-excited QPs is larger for the nodes along the a\naxis, because the QP population near the nodes is more\ndirectly reflected in \u03ba at lower temperatures [13]. (The\nanisotropy in \u03ba above Tc is most likely due to phonons; it\nhas been estimated [9] that phonons are responsible for\nroughly 2/3 of the total \u03ba at Tc .) We note that the uncertainties in the absolute values in Fig. 2 are less than\n10% for both \u03c1 and \u03ba.\nThe magnetic-field dependence of \u03ba reveals more striking in-plane anisotropy of the heat transport. Figure 3\nshows the result of our precise H-dependence measurement (where the relative accuracy is \u223c0.1% [9]) for \u03baa\nand \u03bab at 12.5 and 10 K up to 6 T. Interestingly, only\n\u03bab shows the plateau-like feature, indicating that there\ncannot be a true \"fully-gapped\" state where all the nodes\nare lifted. (If a \"full gap\" causes the QPs to disappear,\nthere should be no QP heat transport in any direction.)\nTo further investigate the magnetic-field dependence\nof \u03ba down to lower temperatures and up to higher magnetic fields, we have measured \u03baa and \u03bab in a 3 He refrigerator equipped with a 16 T magnet (with a bit worse\nsignal-to-noise ratio). Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the\nH-dependences of \u03baa and \u03bab , respectively, down to 0.36\nK and up to 16 T; the trend is clear that \u03baa tends to\ndecrease with H while \u03bab tends to flatten or increase\nwith H. Note that, since the phonons contribute to the\nheat transport in parallel to the QPs, the observed thermal conductivity is a sum of the QP term \u03baQP and the\n\n\f3\n\n(a)\n1.02\n\n0.7 K\n\n1\n1K\n2K\n\n0.98\n\n\u03ba (H) / \u03ba (0 T)\nb\nb\n\n\u03ba (H) / \u03ba (0 T)\na\na\n\n(b)\n\u03ba\n\n1.16\n\n0.36 K\n\n1.04\n\n0.36 K\n\nb\n\n1.12\n\n0.7 K\n1.08\n1K\n1.04\n2K\n\n3K\n0.96\n\n0.94\n\n\u03ba\n\n1\n\n5K\n\na\n\n3K\n5K\n\n7.5 K\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n\n0.96\n0\n\n7.5 K\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8 10 12 14 16\n\nH (T)\n\nH (T)\n\n\u03ba\n1.6\n\na\n\n\u03ba\n\n7.5 K\nb\n\n1.5\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n\n\u03ba ( W / Km )\n\n\u03ba ( W / Km )\n\n0.8\n\n(c)\n\n1.7\n\n0.75\n\na\n\n\u03ba\n\nb\n\n0.7\n0 2\n\n4\n\nH (T)\n\n\u03ba ( W / Km )\n\n0.025\n\n\u03ba\n\n(d)\n\n\u03ba\n\n6\n\n3.0 K\n\n8 10 12 14 16\n\nH (T)\n\ny\n\n(f) b\n\n\u03ba\n\na\n\na\n\n-\n\nb\n\n+\n0.36 K\n0.02\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n+\n\n(e)\n\n8 10 12 14 16\n\nx\n\n-\n\nH (T)\n\nFIG. 4: Magnetic-field dependences of the anisotropic thermal conductivity at lower temperatures and in higher fields.\n(a,b) H-dependences of \u03baa and \u03bab at various temperatures\ndown to 0.36 K.

For BSCCO, it has been discussed\n[8, 9, 12] that more than 90% of the total \u03ba is due to\n\u03baph around 10 K and this \u03baph is independent of H; thus,\nalthough the H-dependence of the total \u03ba is rather weak\nin Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), \u03baQP is actually changing a lot\nwith H.\nThe physical origin of this anisotropic behavior can\nbe inferred by plotting \u03baa and \u03bab at the same temperature together, taking the absolute values for the vertical\naxis [Figs. 4(c)-4(e)]. In the simple kinetic theory, the\nQP thermal conductivity \u03baQP is proportional to both the\nnumber of QPs available for the heat transport, NQP , and\ntheir mean free path lQP ; namely, \u03baQP \u221d NQP lQP . In dwave superconductors, the quantized vortices produced\nby applied magnetic fields are expected to both induce\nQPs near the nodes and scatter them [14, 15, 16]. If\nthere are already a large number of QPs along the a-axis\nin zero field, the increase in NQP due to the vortices may\nbe inconsequential, while the vortex scattering will cause\n\na noticeable reduction in lQP ; as a result, \u03baQP along the\na-axis would tend to decrease with increasing H. On\nthe other hand, if there are only a small number of QPs\nalong the b-axis in zero field, both NQP and lQP along\nthe b-axis will be noticeably changed due to the vortices\nand the changes in NQP and lQP will tend to cancel each\nother, leading to a weaker H-dependence along the baxis. (Actually, one of the probable explanations of the\n\"plateau\" in \u03ba(H) is that it comes from an exact cancellation of the two effects [15].]) This phenomenology\nexplains the behaviors of \u03baa (H) and \u03bab (H) in Figs. 4(c)\nand 4(d) (7.5 and 3.0 K) and is consistent with their\nrelative magnitude. At lower temperature [Fig. 4(e)],\nit appears that the changes in NQP dominate over the\nchanges in lQP , causing \u03ba to increase with H. (Unfortunately, more quantitative analysis of the data is hindered\nby the lack of proper understanding of the vortex scattering of the QPs in the cuprates, which remains rather\ncontroversial [15, 16].)\nThus, the novel anisotropies in both the temperature\ndependence and the magnetic-field dependence of the\nthermal conductivity consistently tell us that there are\nmore QPs near the nodes along the a-axis; this gives\nstrong evidence that the gap structure notably deviates from the dx2 \u2212y2 symmetry. Mixing of a small swave component, which the orthorhombic distortion may\ncause [17], would not produce the observed anisotropy.\nOne simple possibility to make the gap consistent with\nthe observed anisotropy is to introduce \"higher harmonics\"; for example, for a gap with an expression \u2206(k) =\n\u22060 cos 2\u03c6 \u2212 \u22061 sin 4\u03c6, the slope at the nodes is gentle\nalong the a axis and steeper along the b axis [Fig. 4(f)]\n[18]. Of course, some non-analytic modulation of the\ndx2 \u2212y2 symmetry may also be possible.\nSince the reproducibility of the plateau in \u03ba(H) has\nbeen a matter of debate [9], we comment on the reproducibility issue. We reported previously that the plateau\nwas not observed in the majority of samples [9]; recently,\nwe found that this majority of samples were cut along\nthe a-axis, because our crystals usually grow along the\na-axis in the FZ furnace. In fact, the \u03ba(H) data published in Ref. [9] agree with the \u03baa data reported here.\nTo check whether our salient observation reported here\nis reproducible, we have measured another b-axis sample\n(Sample B2) that was taken from a different batch where\nthe crystal grew along the b-axis. We have also measured\na sample (Sample M) which was cut along the direction\n45\u25e6 rotated from the a-axis (Cu-O-Cu bond direction).\nAs shown in Fig. 5, Sample B2 (which is optimally-doped\nwith Tc = 95 K) reproduces the behavior of the first baxis sample [Fig. 4(b)], and Sample M shows the behavior which is essentially an average of \u03baa (H) and \u03bab (H).\nThese results give confidence in the reproducibility as\nwell as the intrinsic nature of our observation.\nIt is useful to note that the angle-resolved photoemission experiments have reported almost completely four-\n\n\f4\n\n(a)\n\n1.16\n\n1.1\n\n0.5 K\n\n0.36 K\n\n0.97 K\n\nb\n\n1.4 K\n1.95 K\n\n1.04\n\n\u03ba (H) / \u03ba (0 T)\n\n1.08\n\n1.12\n\nb\n\n\u03ba (H) / \u03ba (0 T)\n\n0.7 K\n\n1.08\n\n(b)\n\n1.06\n\nCu-O-Cu\nBond Direction\n\n1.04\n\n0.7 K\n\n1.02\n\n1K\n\nfield dependence; this new information should help elucidating the true origin of this intriguing plateau.\nWe thank D.

(In fact, the normal-state resistivity shows negligibly small in-plane anisotropy [Fig. 2(a)], which is consistent with the almost-isotropic Fermi surface.) Therefore,\nthe striking anisotropy in the gap structure suggests that\nthe driving force of the gapping, or the \"glue\" to bind the\nelectrons into Cooper pairs, is anisotropic itself. From\nthis point of view, it would be difficult to imagine that the\nantiferromagnetic interaction on the nearly-square CuO2\nplanes is wholly responsible for the pairing, though it is\noften considered to be the most likely candidate. On the\nother hand, the phonons are expected to be anisotropic\nin BSCCO because of the pronounced modulation structure [21], and thus the role played by the phonons in\npairing is an interesting possibility. Another possibility\nis a role of the charge inhomogeneity [22], which could\nbe related to the isotropic or nematic phases of the electronic liquid crystal [23, 24], though the impact of such\ninhomogeneous structure on the gapping and on the QP\nbehavior is not understood yet. In any case, the novel\nanisotropy in the gap structure suggested by the present\nexperiment should help clarifying how the superconducting gap is formed in high-Tc superconductors.\nIn summary, we have measured the thermal conductivity \u03ba of BSCCO along the a and b axes in essentially the same high-quality single crystal down to 0.36\nK. It is found that the temperature dependence and the\nmagnetic-field dependence of \u03ba both show peculiar inplane anisotropy, and the observed anisotropy is consistent with the interpretation that there are more QPs near\nthe nodes along the a axis. This result gives evidence that\nthe d-wave gap is uniquely distorted in BSCCO, which\nsuggests that the electron pairing is contributed by the\ninteraction that develops a pronounced anisotropy between the a and b axes. In addition, our measurement\nclarifies that only \u03bab shows the \"plateau\" in its magnetic-\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: ando@criepi.denken.or.jp\n[1] C. C. Tsuei and J. R.
