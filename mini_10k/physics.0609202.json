INTRODUCTION\nThe Michelson-Morley experiment [1] was perhaps the most important negative experiment in the\nhistory of science. Its null result led to Einstein's Special Relativity [2]. The experiment has been repeated\nmany times in improved experimental conditions [3] and many kinds of Michelson-Morley type\nexperiments have also been conducted [4,5]. All of them gave a null result. However, all these experiments\nwere carried out in the laboratories which were stationary with respect to the earth. To fully verify the\nprinciple of relativity requires re-conducting the Michelson-Morley experiment at least in a reference frame\nmoving relative to the earth [6,7], with which the principle of the constancy of the speed of light will also\nbe examined. The Michelson-Morley experiment is a second-order experiment, i.e., the possible effect is\nproportional to (v/c)2, where v is the speed of the system. Therefore, conducting the Michelson-Morley\nexperiment in a moving system would require a very high speed.\nA first-order interference experiment has an intrinsic advantage over the second-order experiment. The\npossibility of the first-order experiment comes from the utilization of the nonlinear optical properties.\nWhile the conventional interferometers utilize beam splitters, mirrors and lenses that have linear optical\nproperties, the utilization of the nonlinear optical properties brings a magnificent change to the\ninterferometers. Phase-conjugate mirrors (PCMs) [8,9,10], the nonlinear optical devices, have an important\nproperty of phase reversal. Because of this property, the experiment utilizing the phase-conjugate\ninterferometer can be the first-order. Besides, utilization of the PCM will totally change the basic concepts\nof the interference experiment. Unlike the traditional interference experiment with which the effective light\npaths constitute a closed loop, we can have a one-arm phase-conjugate interferometer. Actually placing a\nconventional partially reflecting mirror just in front of the PCM at the end of a light path, we can conduct\nthe test of the one-way speed of light in a system in straight-line uniform motion. Because these\nexperiments are the first-order, the sensitivities of these experiments are very high.\n2. PHASE-CONJUGATE FIRST-ORDER EXPERIMENT\nThe Michelson-Morley experiment using the Michelson interferometer (Fig. 1) is a second-order\nexperiment. For the time intervals that the light beam takes to travel from BS to M1 and to travel back [11]\nwe have\nt1 = L/(c+v)\nand\n\n\f2\nt2 = L/(c-v)\nHence,\nt1 = L/[c(1+v/c)] = L/c - (L/c)(v/c) + (L/c)(v/c)2 + O[(v/c)3]\nand\nt2 = L/[c(1-v/c)] = L/c + (L/c)(v/c) + (L/c)(v/c)2 + O[(v/c)3]\n\nM2\n\nv\nS\n\nBS\n\nL\nt2\n\nt1\n\nM1\n\nD\nFig. 1. The Michelson-Morley experiment. A light beam from the source S is divided into two\nbeams, perpendicular to one another, by beam splitter BS. Two beams are reflected by mirrors, M1\nand M2, and recombined by BS. The interference pattern is measured at detector D.\nNeglecting terms of order higher than the second, the time interval that the light beam takes for a round trip\nis\nt = t1 + t2 = 2L/c + 2(L/c)(v/c)2\nIn term of the phase, from BS to M1 the light beam experiences a phase shift of\n\u03c61 = 2\u03c0ct1/\u03bb = 2\u03c0L/\u03bb - (2\u03c0L/\u03bb)(v/c) + (2\u03c0L/\u03bb)(v/c)2 + O[(v/c)3]\nReflected from the mirror M1, the light beam firstly experiences a phase change of one-half wavelength and\nthen experiences a phase shift from M1 to BS:\n\u03c0 + \u03c62 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0ct2/\u03bb = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0L/\u03bb + (2\u03c0L/\u03bb)(v/c) + (2\u03c0L/\u03bb)(v/c)2 + O[(v/c)3]\nTherefore, when the mirror is a conventional mirror, the total phase shift of the light beam is\n\u03c6 = \u03c61 + \u03c0 + \u03c62 = \u03c0 + 4\u03c0L/\u03bb + (4\u03c0L/\u03bb)(v/c)2\nneglecting terms of order higher than the second.\nAs a matter of fact, both \u03c61 and \u03c62 have the first-order term, (2\u03c0L/\u03bb)(v/c), but one is positive and\nanother one is negative so they cancel each other. Therefore, the Michelson-Morley experiment with a\nconventional mirror is a second-order experiment. Besides, Lorentz proved that the interference\nexperiments cannot detect the first-order effects [12] according to the classical theory.\nThe above derivations are based on the conventional interferometers and the phase shift of the light\nbeam of a round-trip path is \u03c61+\u03c62. However, if we have a method to change the positive phase shift to a\nnegative phase shift, the first-order effect will augment each other instead of canceling each other. For\nexample, if the mirror converts \u03c61 to -\u03c61, we will have a total phase shift of -\u03c61+\u03c62. In this case the two firstorder terms, (2\u03c0L/\u03bb)(v/c) in the Michelson-Morley experiment no longer cancel each other, but augment\neach other. Then we will have a first-order experiment. Actually changing a positive phase shift to a\nnegative phase shift is what some PCMs can do.\nThe difference between a conventional mirror and such a PCM can be clearly shown in the experiments\n[13]. In the Michelson interferometer with the conventional mirror, a uniform phase shift in the path (\u0394\u03c6)\nwill be doubled (2\u0394\u03c6) at the detector (Fig. 2a and 2b). However, if the conventional mirror is replaced by\nthe PCM in the Michelson interferometer, the uniform phase shift in the path, \u0394\u03c6, will be cancelled at the\ndetector. In fact, the light beam firstly experiences a phase shift \u0394\u03c6 when propagating east, the PCM\nreverses \u0394\u03c6 to -\u0394\u03c6, then the light beam experiences a phase shift \u0394\u03c6 again when it propagates back to the\ndetector. The total phase shift becomes -\u0394\u03c6+\u0394\u03c6 = 0. With the same reason, if a negative phase shift \u2212\u0394\u03c6 is\nadded in the incident path and a positive phase shift +\u0394\u03c6 is added in the reflected path (Fig. 3a), we will\n\n\f3\n\nM\n\n\u0394\u03c6\n\nS\n\nReflector\n(Conventional\nmirror or\nPCM)\n\nBS\n\nD\n\nPhase shift detected, radians\n\nfind a zero phase shift at the detector in the Michelson interferometer with a conventional mirror and a\ndouble phase shift at the detector in the Michelson interferometer with a PCM (Fig. 3b).\n\n30\nConventional\nmirror\n\n20\n10\n\nPCM\n\n0\n0\n\n(a)\n\n20\n10\n\u0394\u03c6, radians\n(b)\n\n30\n\nM\n\n+\u0394\u03c6\nD\nS\n\nM\n\nBS\nBS\n\n\u2212\u0394\u03c6\n\nBS\n\nReflector\n(Conventional\nmirror or PCM)\n\nPhase shift detected, radians\n\nFig. 2.

Another experiment shows the difference between a conventional mirror and a PCM. (a)\nThe Michelson interferometer with a conventional mirror or a PCM. (b) Phase shift detected vs\nphase shift introduced.\n\nTherefore, if we conduct an experiment with a phase-conjugate Michelson interferometer shown in Fig.\n4, the two first-order terms will augment each other:\n\u03c6 = -\u03c61 + \u03c62 = (4\u03c0L/\u03bb)(v/c)\nneglecting terms of order higher than the second. It is a first-order experiment. More generally, Lorentz's\nconclusion that the interference experiments cannot detect the first-order effects is not true for a phaseconjugate interferometer because the possibility of the phase reversal is not considered.\n\n\f4\nGenerally speaking, changing \u03c61 to -\u03c61 is not the only way to have the first-order experiment. The\nexperiment is valid as long as \u03c61 of the incident wave is not preserved as \u03c61 + constant of the reflected wave\nlike in the case of a conventional mirror. For example, the phase shift can be changed to \u20130.5\u03c61, zero, or 2\u03c61,\netc. This is useful when we select proper PCMs for the experiments.\n\nConventional\nmirror or PCM\n\n180o\n\nv\nS\n\nBS\n\nL\nt2\n\nt1\n\nPCM\n\nD\nFig. 4. The phase-conjugate first-order experiment.\nBecause only the first-order effect is concerned, the effect in the vertical arm of the Michelson\ninterferometer, a second-order effect, is not considered. Lorentz contraction, a second-order effect, is not\nrelevant in the first-order experiment. Moreover, the term related to the length of the horizontal arm,\n2\u03c0L/\u03bb, does not appear anymore in the experiment shown in Fig. 4. Hence any distortion introduced to the\nhorizontal arm such as vibration can be eliminated. Using the PCM in the vertical arm is not necessary, but\nis preferable to make the apparatus stable optically.\nWe can conduct the first-order experiment in several ways. The first one is to compare the phase shift\nof speed v with that of zero speed, \u03c6(v) -\u03c6(0) = 4\u03c0vL/c\u03bb. The second one is to compare the phase shifts\nbefore and after turning 180 degrees with speed v (Fig. 4). Turning the phase-conjugate Michelson\ninterferometer 180 degrees, the speed v becomes \u2013v and the phase shift becomes \u03c6 -\u03c6(180) = 8\u03c0vL/c\u03bb.\nBesides, we can conduct the experiment in a laboratory like the Michelson-Morley experiment did.\nAssuming that the fiber technology is used and the detector has a sensitivity of 10-7 radians for the\nphase shift, with L = 5 m and \u03bb = 0.5 \u03bcm, the experiment will be sensitive to a speed v = 10-7c\u03bb/8\u03c0L = 0.12\n\u03bcm/s to check whether or not the phase shift exists.\n\n3. PHASE-CONJUGATE SAGNAC EXPERIMENT\nThe Sagnac effect [14] shows that in a rotating closed path, two counterpropagating light beams take\ndifferent time intervals to travel the closed path. For example, when the closed path rotates\ncounterclockwise, the beam propagating counterclockwise takes a longer period of time than that of the\nbeam propagating clockwise, and vise versa. The time difference is given by \u0394t = 2R\u03a9L/c2, where R is the\nradius of the circular motion, \u03a9 is the rotational rate and L is the length of the path. The Sagnac effect is a\nfully verified experimental fact with numerous applications including highly precise fiber optic gyroscopes\nthat are widely used in navigations. However, the arguments about its implications have never stopped and\nit is called an unsolved fundamental problem in physics [15]. A remarkable feature of the Sagnac effect is\nthat all other effects related to the rotation, e.g., the centripetal force, will approach zero when the radius of\nthe circular motion becomes increasingly larger while the speed of circular motion keeps constant; however,\nthe Sagnac effect will not approach zero, but a finite value. Therefore, an apparent argument is that when\nthe radius of the circular motion becomes increasingly larger, the circular motion approaches the linear\nmotion and if the Sagnac effect still exists, i.e., the time difference still exists, does it contradict the\nprinciple of the constancy of the speed of light? The phase-conjugate Sagnac experiment on a segment light\n\n\f5\npath [16], not the closed path like that in the most Sagnac experiments, makes this argument even more\nserious.\nThe experiment using a phase-conjugate Michelson interferometer is shown in Fig. 5. According to the\nSagnac effect, from point A to point B, the light beam experiences a phase shift of\n\u03c61 = kL - 2\u03c0R\u03a9L/c\u03bb\nwhere k = (2\u03c0n)/\u03bb is the circular wave number.\nIn the return trip, the phase shift is\n\u03c62 = kL + 2\u03c0R\u03a9L/c\u03bb\nBecause of the phase reversal on the PCM, the round-trip phase shift becomes\n\u03c6 = -\u03c61 + \u03c62 = 4\u03c0R\u03a9L/c\u03bb\n\n\u03a9\n\nM\n\nR1\nS\n\nv\n\nBS\nA\nD\n\nPCM\n\nR\n\nL\n\nB\n\nv\n\nR2\nM\n\nL\n\nv\nL\n\nFig. 5.

The phase-conjugate Sagnac experiment\nwith an increasingly larger radius of the rotation.\nThis experiment shows us two important points. First, it confirms the phase reversal of a PCM and\ndemonstrates the Sagnac effect in an arc segment AB, not a closed path. Second, it gives us important\nimplications as analyzed below. (Although in the experiment [16], the flexible fiber path was rotating and\nthe other optical parts were not, in a similar experiment [17] all optical parts were rotating together.) The\nresult, \u03c6 = 4\u03c0R\u03a9L/c\u03bb, can be re-written as \u03c6 = 4\u03c0vL/c\u03bb where v is the speed of the moving arc segment AB.\nIf we increase the radius of the circular motion as shown in Fig. 6, the arc segment AB will approach a\nlinear segment AB, the circular motion will approach the linear motion, the phase-conjugate Sagnac\nexperiment will approach the phase-conjugate first-order experiment as shown in Fig. 4, and the phase shift\nis always \u03c6 = 4\u03c0vL/c\u03bb. Therefore the result of this experiment indicates what we could expect from the\nphase-conjugate first-order experiment.\n4. GENERALIZED SAGNAC EFFECT\nThat a segment in linear motion contributes a phase shift \u03c6 = 4\u03c0vL/c\u03bb not only is a deduction from the\nphase-conjugate Sagnac experiment, but also is based on the experimental fact of the generalized Sagnac\neffect [18,19]: for any moving segment of a loop there is a phase difference, \u03c6 = 4\u03c0vL/c\u03bb, between counterpropagating light beams in the segment of length L and speed v whether the segment is in circular motion\n\n\f6\nor linear motion. (Generally, the phase difference is proportional to a product of the moving velocity v and\nthe projection of the segment length L on the moving direction, \u03c6 = 4\u03c0 v \u22c5 L /c\u03bb.) The experimental fact\nwas confirmed with different configurations, circles and conveyors, conveyors with different lengths, twowheel and three-wheel conveyors, figure-8 and zero-area conveyors, and parallelograms (Fig. 7). Clearly,\nin the segment moving linearly, there is a phase difference \u03c6 = 4\u03c0vL/c\u03bb, between counterpropagating beams.\nTherefore, it is very important to see whether the phase-conjugate first-order experiment will give a nonnull result, \u03c6 = 4\u03c0vL/c\u03bb.\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(e)\n(d)\n\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\nFig. 7.

TEST OF THE ONE-WAY SPEED OF LIGHT\nThe importance of the test of the one-way speed of light can never be overestimated because the\nisotropy of the one-way speed of light not only is the foundation of the principle of the constancy of the\nspeed of light, but also is the core of the problem of simultaneity. It was stated by Einstein: \"That light\nrequires the same time to traverse the path A \u2192 M as for the path B \u2192 M is in reality neither a supposition\nnor a hypothesis about the physical nature of light, but a stipulation which I can make of my own freewill\nin order to arrive at a definition of simultaneity.\" (M is the mid-point of line AB.) [20] The test of the oneway speed of light is difficult because the clock type of the experiments has the problem of the clock\nsynchronization and the interference type of the experiments has the problem of the closed light path.\nSometime it was even claimed that the one-way speed of light cannot be tested by the experiments [21].\nFor an interference experiment, the following concepts are always used explicitly or implicitly: the\nbasic operating principle of an interference experiment is that a light ray from the source is divided into two\nrays 1 and 2 at point A (Fig. 8), the two rays traverse different paths I and II and they are brought to\ninterference at another point B, the detector measures the phase difference between the two different paths\n[11]. It is also naturally thought that the effective light paths I and II for the interference experiment must\nconstitute a closed loop and that the path from the source to the dividing point A does not have any role to\nthe interference pattern measured at the detector. However, these concepts are true only for a traditional\n\n\f7\n\nSource\n\nA\n1\nI\n\n2\nII\n\nB\nDetector\nFig. 8.

In this way,\nthe light path L actually plays two roles, one as a path with a conventional mirror and one as a path with a\nPCM. If there is a phase shift \u0394\u03c6 in this one-way light path L, the conventional mirror preserves the phase\nshift and the PCM reverses the phase shift. Therefore a detector near the end of the path will detect a\ndouble phase shift, i.e., -2\u0394\u03c6 (Fig. 9c), between the two beams that are from the conventional mirror and\nthe PCM. Obviously, the concepts that the effective light paths must constitute a closed loop and the path\nfrom the source to the dividing point does not play any role to the interference pattern at the detector are\nnot true anymore.\nTherefore with phase-conjugate interferometers, we can conduct the tests of the one-way speed of light\nfor a system moving uniformly in a straight line (Fig. 10a) and for one-way Sagnac effect (Fig. 10b).

SELECTING PROPER PCMS FOR THE EXPERIMENTS\nA proper PCM that reverses the uniform phase shift should be selected for the experiments. There are\nmany types of the PCMs [22,23]. However, not all the PCMs have this phase reversal property. Those\nPCMs that are self-starting, for example the stimulated Brillouin scattering, have overall phase ambiguities\nthat prevent compensation for optical path difference and they cannot provide the phase reversal [24].\nThe externally pumped PCM (EPPCM) with the four-wave mixing [25,26] can perform the phase\nreversal but the impact of the two pump waves should be studied. For the phase-conjugate Sagnac\nexperiment or the one-way Sagnac experiment, pump waves pass in the radial directions (Fig. 11a and 11b)\nand there is no a phase shift due to the pump waves, so an EPPCM is suitable.\n\nM\n\nM\n\nv\nS\n\nBS\n\nv\n\n- 2\u03c0vL/c\u03bb\n\nBS\nM\n\nM\n\nM\nS1\n\nEPPCM\n\nBS\n\nM\n\nM\n\nD\n\nPump\nwaves\n\nFig. 12.

The Michelson interferometer\nwith an EPPCM and two separate lasers.\n\nLet us consider the EPPCM for the phase-conjugate first-order experiment. As shown in Fig. 12, each\nof the two pump waves experiences a phase shift of -2\u03c0vL/c\u03bb, which is the same as the incident wave. The\nPCM reverses the phase shift of the incident wave. However, because of the existence of the phase shift\nbrought by each of the two pump waves [13], the phase shift of the reflected wave left the PCM is\n2\u03c0vL/c\u03bb \u2212 2\u03c0vL/c\u03bb -2\u03c0vL/c\u03bb = \u22122\u03c0vL/c\u03bb.

Two configurations of using the MPPCM for the test of the one-way speed of light are shown in Fig.\n14a and 14b, where one uses two light sources having the same frequency and another one uses only one\nlight source.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nThe phase-conjugate Sagnac experiment can be repeated and the one-way Sagnac experiment can be\nconducted using the PCM. We can expect that the phase shift is \u03c6 = 4\u03c0vL/c\u03bb in the one-way Sagnac\nexperiment with path length L and speed v, even with an increasingly larger radius of the rotation. Based on\nthese and the experimental fact of the generalized Sagnac effect, it is very important to examine whether\nthere is the same phase shift for the test of the one-way speed of light and the phase-conjugate first-order\nexperiment in a system moving uniformly in a straight line. The sensitivities of these experiments are very\nhigh.\nE-mail address: ruwang@stcloudstate.edu\nReferences\n[1] A. A. Michelson and E. W. Morley, Am. J. Sci. 34 (1887) 333.\n[2] A.
