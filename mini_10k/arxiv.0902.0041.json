This leads to the question of what can one say\nabout the zeros of a sequence of polynomials satisfying (1) which is not\northogonal. Examples of such sequences include the Bell polynomials [1], the\nEuler-Frobenius polynomials [5] and the so-called derivative polynomials [6].\nA number of authors have investigated the properties of the zeros of\nsequences of polynomials that are solutions of (1) but are not, in general,\northogonal. In [10], Vertgeim considered polynomials generated by (1) with\nAn (x) = an x2 \u2212 bn ,\n\nBn (x) = \u03b1an x,\n\n\u03b1, an , bn > 0,\n\nthat generalize the Euler polynomials. In [3], [4], Dubeau and Savoie study\ninterlacing properties of the zeros of polynomial solutions of (1) with\n\u0001\nAn (x) = \u03ban 1 \u2212 x2 , Bn (x) = \u22122\u03ban rn x, rn > 0, \u03ban 6= 0,\n\nwhich contain the generalized Euler-Frobenius and the ultraspherical polynomials as special cases. They also consider the Hermite-like polynomials\ndefined by (1) with\nAn (x) = \u03ban ,\n\nBn (x) = \u22122\u03ban x,\n\n\u03ban 6= 0.\n\nIn [8], Liu and Wang analyze polynomial solutions of the equation\nPn+1 (x) = An (x)Pn\u2032 (x) + Bn (x)Pn (x) + Cn (x)Pn\u22121 (x), n = 0, 1, . . . .\n\n(2)\n\nBy assuming that Pn (x) has strictly nonnegative coefficients (respectively\nalternating in sign) and An (x) < 0 or Cn (x) < 0 for x \u2264 0 (respectively\nx \u2265 0), , they show that {Pn (x)}\u221e\nn=0 forms a Sturm sequence. Although\n(2) is more general than (1), the conditions on the sign of the coefficients of\nPn (x) is a priori very difficult to check, except in rather isolated situations.\nIn this paper, we shall take an approach similar to that used in [10].\nWe establish criteria that ensure, for a sequence of polynomials {Pn (x)}\u221e\nn=0\nsatisfying (1), either that all zeros of Pn are real and simple, or the zeros\nof Pn and Pn+1 are interlacing, or both, based on conditions that can be\nchecked directly from An and Bn . We present several interesting examples\nand consider possible extensions.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminary results\n\nIt is obvious that any sequence of polynomials is a solution of (1), if we allow\nAn (x) and Bn (x) to be (non unique) rational functions of x. The question\nof characterizing which sequences of polynomials {Pn (x)}\u221e\nn=0 are solutions of\n(1), when An (x) and Bn (x) are polynomials in x, is addressed in the following\ntheorem.\nTheorem 1 Suppose that Pn (x) is a polynomial with n simple zeros. Let\nPn (xn,k ) = 0,\n\nyn,k =\n\nPn+1 (xn,k )\n,\nPn\u2032 (xn,k )\n\nk = 1, . . . , n.\n\n(3)\n\nThen the following are equivalent:\ni) There exist polynomials An (x) and Bn (x) of degree at most 2 and 1 respectively such that {Pn (x)}\u221e\nn=0 satisfies (1). For every n \u2265 3, An (x)\nand Bn (x) are unique.\nii) For every n \u2265 2, there exists a quadratic polynomial An (x) such that\nAn (xn,k ) = yn,k ,\n\nk = 1, . . . , n.\n\nProof. Evaluating (1) at the zeros of Pn (x), we clearly see that i) =\u21d2 ii).\nAssume now that ii) holds. For n = 0, we have\nP1 (x) = A0 (x)P0\u2032 (x) + B0 (x)P0 (x) = B0 (x),\nsince P0 (x) = 1. Thus, A0 (x) can be any polynomial of degree at most 2 and\nB0 (x) = P1 (x). For n = 1, let B1 (x) be an arbitrary polynomial of degree at\nmost 1 and define A1 (x) by\nA1 (x) =\n\nP2 (x) \u2212 B1 (x)P1 (x)\n.\nP1\u2032 (x)\n\nSince P1\u2032 (x) is a non-zero constant, we see that i) holds for n = 1. For n \u2265 2,\nlet An (x) be a quadratic polynomial such that\nyn,k = An (xn,k ),\n\nk = 1, . . . , n.\n\nThen Pn+1 (x) \u2212 An (x)Pn\u2032 (x) is a polynomial of degree at most n + 1 that is\nzero at each xn,k and therefore divisible by Pn (x). This yields the existence\nof a Bn that is at most linear. When n \u2265 3, An is uniquely determined so\nthat i) holds.\n4\n\n\fRemark 2 The assumption that Pn (x) has n simple zeros is not very restrictive in the sense that the statement and proof of Theorem 1 can be modified\nto cater for this possibility.\nExample 3 Let Pn (x) be the family of orthonormal polynomials with respect\nto the Freud-type weight\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\nt2\n1\n4\n2\n\u0001 exp \u2212x + 2tx \u2212\nw(x) =\n,\nt K 1 t22\n4\n4\n\nwhere K\u03bd (z) is the Bessel function of the second kind.

We deduce from Theorem 1 that there are no polynomials\nAn (x)andBn (x) such that Pn (x) satisfies (1).\n\u03b6\u00b1 =\n\n3\n\nMain result\n\nIn our proofs, we will find it convenient to re-write the differential-difference\nequation (1) in the form\nPn+1 (x) =\n\nAn (x) d\n[Kn (x)Pn (x)],\nKn (x) dx\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Kn (x) is an \"integrating factor\", defined by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb x\nZ\nBn (t) \uf8f8\ndt .\nKn (x) = exp \uf8ed\nAn (t)\n\n(6)\n\nSince An (x) and Bn (x) are polynomials, we can obtain all possible functions\nKn (x) by considering the location of the zeros of An (x) and Bn (x). This\nleads to the following classification, where we define the extended real line\nby (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) \u222a {\u2212\u221e, \u221e} and the notation f (\u00b1\u221e) = 0 means lim f (x) = 0.\nx\u2192\u00b1\u221e\n\nTheorem 4 Let Kn (x) be defined by (6).
