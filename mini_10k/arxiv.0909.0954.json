This gravitational-wave \"memory\njumps\" are particularly significant in the case of merger\nof a binary black hole, as was recently pointed out by\nFavata (2009, hereafter F09). Favata has shown (see Figure 1 of F09) that for the case of an equal-mass binary,\na metric memory jump \u03b4h was of the order of \u223c 5 percent of M/R, where M is the mass of the binary component and R is the co-moving distance to the binary measured at redshift 0 (hereafter M is expressed in the geometric units, i.e. M = GM/c2 ). Furthermore, Favata has\nargued that the memory jumps were potentially detectable\nby LISA with high signal-to-noise ratio. Favata's memory\ncalculations make use of an approximate analytical treatment of the mergers, and need to be followed up with more\ndefinitive numerical calculations. Nevertheless, a number of\nanalytical models explored in F09 show that the effect is\nclearly of high importance, and thus further investigations\nof detectability of the memory jumps are warranted.\nRecently, there has been a renewed effort to measure gravitational waves from widely separated supermassive black-hole (SMBH) binaries by using precise timing of\ngalactic millisecond pulsars (Jenet et al. 2005; Manchester\n2006). In this paper we investigate whether pulsar timing\narrays (PTAs) could be sensitive to the memory jumps from\nphysical mergers of the SMBHs at the end of the binary's\nlife. We demonstrate that modern PTAs (Manchester 2006),\nafter 10 years of operation, will be sensitive to mergers of\n108 M\u2299 black holes out to \u223cbillion light years; however the\nc 0000 RAS\n\nchances of actual detection are small. Futuristic PTA experiments, like those performed on the Square Kilometer Array\n(Cordes et al. 2005), offer a somewhat better prospect for\nthe direct detection of gravitational-wave memory jumps.\n\n2\n\nTHE SIGNAL\n\nThe gravitational waveform from a merger of SMBH pair\nconsists of an ac-part and a dc-part; see Figure 1 of F09.\nThe ac-part is short-period and short-lived, and hence is\nundetectable by a PTA. The dc-part is the gravitationalwave memory; it grows rapidly during the merger, on the\ntimescale of \u223c 10M (1 + z) \u2243 104 (M/108 M\u2299 )(1 + z)s,\nwhere M is the mass of the SMBHs (assumed equal) and\nz is the redshift of the merger. After the burst passes, the\nchange in metric persists, and as we explain below, it is\nthis durable change in the metric that makes the main impact on the timing residuals. Realistic PTA programs are\ndesigned to clock each of the pulsars with \u223c 2-week intervals\n(Manchester 2006, Bailes, private communications). Therefore, for M = 108 M\u2299 SMBHs the growth of the memoryrelated metric change is not time-resolved by the timing\nmeasurements. Moreover, even for M = 1010 M\u2299 SMBHs\nthis growth occurs on the timescale much shorter than the\nduration on the experiment. We are therefore warranted to\ntreat the dc-part of the gravitational wave as a discontinuous\njump propagating through space,\nh(~r, t) = h0 \u00d7 \u0398 [(t \u2212 t0 ) \u2212 ~n * ~r] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere h0 is the amplitude of the jump, of the order of\n0.05M/R, \u0398(t) is the Heavyside function, t0 is the moment\nof time when the gravitational-wave burst passes an observer, ~r is the location in space relative to the observer,\n\n\f2\n\nvan Haasteren and Levin\n\nand ~n is the unit vector pointed in the direction of the wave\npropagation. Here and below we set c = 1. We have used\nthe plane-wave approximation, which is justified for treating\nextragalactic gravitational waves as they propagate through\nthe Galaxy.\nFor a single pulsar, the frequency of the pulsearrival \u03bd responds to a plane gravitational wave according to the following equation (Estabrook & Wahlquist 1975;\nHellings & Downs 1983):\n\u03b4\u03bd(t)\n=\n\u03bd\nwhere\n\nB(\u03b8, \u03c6) \u00d7 [h(t) \u2212 h(t \u2212 r \u2212 r cos \u03b8)] ,\n\n(2)\n\n1\ncos(2\u03c6) (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) .\n(3)\n2\nHere r is the Earth-pulsar distance at an angle \u03b8 to the\ndirection of the wave propagation, \u03c6 is the angle between the\nwave's principle polarization and the projection of the pulsar\nonto the plane perpendicular to the propagation direction,\nand h(t) is the gravitational-wave strain at the observer's\nlocation. Substituting Eq. (1) into the above equation, we\nobtain the mathematical form of the signal:\n\nB(\u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\n\u03b4\u03bd(t)\n= h0 B(\u03b8, \u03c6) \u00d7 [\u0398(t \u2212 t0 ) \u2212 \u0398(t \u2212 t1 )] ,\n\u03bd\n\n(4)\n\nwhere t1 = t0 + r(1 + cos \u03b8). Thus the memory jump would\ncause a pair of pulse frequency jumps of equal magnitude\nand the opposite sign, separated by the time interval r(1 +\ncos \u03b8). Since typical PTA pulsars are at least \u223c 103 light\nyears away, a single merger could generate at most one of\nthe frequency jumps as seen during the \u223c 10 years of a\nPTA experiment. The timing residuals from a single jump\nat t = t0 are given by\nm(t) = B(\u03b8, \u03c6)h0 \u00d7 \u0398(t \u2212 t0 ) \u00d7 (t \u2212 t0 ).\n\n(5)\n\nFor a single pulsar the frequency jump is indistinguishable from a fast glitch, and therefore single-pulsar data can\nonly be used for placing upper limits on gravitational-wave\nmemory jumps. The situation would be different for an array of pulsars, where simultaneous pulse frequency jumps\nwould occur in all of them at the time t = t0 when the\ngravitational-wave burst would reach the Earth. Therefore\na PTA could in principle be used to to detect memory jumps.\n\n3\n\nSINGLE-SOURCE DETECTION BY PTAS.\n\nIn this section we develop a mathematical framework\nfor the single-source detection by a PTA. Our formalism\nis essentially Bayesian and follows closely the spirit of\nvan Haasteren et al. (2009, hereafter vHLML), although we\nwill make a connection with the frequentist Wiener-filter estimator. We will then apply our general formalism to the\nmemory jumps. The reader uninterested in mathematical\ndetails should skip the following subsection and go straight\nto the results in section 5.\nThere is a large body of literature on the single-source\ndetection in the gravitational-wave community (Finn 1992;\nOwen 1996; Brady et al. 1998). The techniques which have\nbeen developed so far are designed specifically for the interferometric gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO and LISA.\nThere are several important modifications which need to be\n\nconsidered when applying these techniques to PTAs, among\nthem\n1. Discreteness of the data set. A single timing residual\nper observed pulsar is obtained during the observing run;\nthese runs are separated by at least several weeks. This is in\ncontrast to the continuous (for all practical purposes) data\nstream in LIGO and LISA.\n2. Subtraction of the systematic corrections. The most\nessential of these is the quadratic component of the timing\nresiduals due to pulsar spindown, but there may be others,\ne.g. jumps of the zero point due to equipment change, annual modulations, etc.\n3. Duration of the signal may be comparable to the\nduration of the experiment. This is the case for both\ncosmological stochastic background considered in vHLML,\nand for the memory jumps considered here. Thus frequency\ndomain methods are not optimal, and time-domain formalism should be developed instead.\nThe Bayesian time-domain approach developed in\nvHLML and in this subsection is designed to tackle these\n3 complications.\nConsider a collection of N timing residuals \u03b4tp obtained\nfrom clocking a number of pulsars. Here p is the composite\nindex meant to indicate both the pulsar and the observing\nrun together. Mathematically, we represent the residuals as\nfollows:\n\u03b4tp = A \u00d7 s(tp ) + \u03b4tn\np + Q(tp ).\n\n(6)\n\nHere s(tp ) and A are the known functional form and unknown amplitude of a gravitational-wave signal from a single\nsource, \u03b4tn\np is the stochastic contribution from a combination\nof the timing and receiver noises, and\nQ(tp ) = \u03a3m \u03bem fm (tp )\n\n(7)\n\nis the contribution from systematic errors of known functional forms fm (tp ) but a-priory unknown magnitudes \u03bem .\nBelow we shall specify Q(tp ) to be the unsubtracted part\nof the quadratic spindown, however for now we prefer to\nkeep the discussion as general as possible. We follow van\nHaasteren et al. (2009) and rewrite Eq. (6) in a vector form:\n~ = A~s + \u03b4t\n~ n + F \u03be.\n~\n\u03b4t\n\n(8)\n\n~ \u03b4t\n~ n , ~s, and \u03be~\nHere the components of the column vectors \u03b4t,\nare given by \u03b4tp , \u03b4tn\np , s(tp ), and \u03bem , and F is a non-square\nmatrix with the elements Fpm = fm (tp ). Henceforth we assume that \u03b4tn\np is the random Gaussian process, with the\nsymmetric positive-definite coherence matrix C:\nn\nCpq =< \u03b4tn\np \u03b4tq > .\n\n(9)\n\nWe can now write down the joint probability distribution\nfor A and \u03bem :\n~\nP (A, \u03bem |\u03b4t)\n\n=\n\n(1/M )P0 (A, \u03bem ) \u00d7\nh\n1 ~\n~ T \u00d7 C \u22121 \u00d7,\nexp \u2212 (\u03b4t\n\u2212 A~s \u2212 F \u03be)\n2\n\u0003\n~ \u2212 A~s \u2212 F \u03be)\n~ .\n(\u03b4t\n\n(10)\n\nHere P0 (A, \u03bem ) is the prior probability distribution, and M\nis the overall normalization factor. We now assume a flat\nprior P0 (A, Lm ) = const, and marginalize over \u03be~ in precisely\nthe same way as shown in the Appendix of vHLML. As a\nresult, we get the following Gaussian probability distribution\nfor A:\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fmemory and pulsar timing arrays\n~ = \u221a\nP (A|\u03b4t)\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n(A \u2212 \u0100)2\n1\n.\nexp \u2212\n2\u03c3 2\n2\u03c0\u03c3\n\n(11)\n\nHere, the mean value \u0100 and the standard deviation \u03c3 are\ngiven by\n~\n~sT C \u2032 \u03b4t\n\u0100 = T \u2032 ,\n~s C ~s\n\n(12)\n\nWe now fix A to its maximum-likelihood value\n~\nh~s(~\n\u03b7 ), R\u03b4ti/h~\ns(~\n\u03b7 ), R~s(~\n\u03b7 )i, and average over a large number\n~ n .

For simplicity, we assume that all of the pulsar observations are performed regularly so that the timingresidual measurements are separated by a fixed time \u2206t,\nand that the whole experiment lasts over the time interval [\u2212T, T ] (expressed in this way for mathematical convenience). Furthermore, we assume that the timing/receiver\nnoise is white, i.e. that for a pulsar a\nn\n2\nh\u03b4tn\ni \u03b4tj i = \u03c3a \u03b4ij .\n\n(23)\n\nSo far we have assumed that the gravitational-wave signal\nhas a known functional form but unknown amplitude, and\nhave explained how to measure or constrain this amplitude.\nIn reality, the waveform ~s(~\n\u03b7 , tP ) will depend on a number of\na-priori unknown parameters ~\n\u03b7 , such as the starting time of\nthe gravitational-wave burst and the direction from which\nthis burst has come. These parameters enter into the probability distribution function through ~s in Eq. (10), and generally their distribution functions have to be estimated numerically. The estimates can be done via the matched filtering\n(Owen 1996) or by performing Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo\n(MCMC) simulations. In section 5, we will demonstrate an\nexample of an MCMC simulation for the memory jump. In\nthis section, we show how to estimate an average statistical\nerror on ~\n\u03b7 for signals with high signal-to-noise ratios.\nLet us begin with a joint likelihood function for the\namplitude A and other parameters \u03b7:\n\nwhere A0 , A1 , and A2 are a-priori unknown parameters.\nWe now come back to the formalism developed in the\nprevious section.

We postpone discussion of the non-white noises\nto future work.\nTo keep our exposition transparent, we consider the case\nwhen the array consists of a single pulsar a; generalization\nto several pulsars is straightforward and is shown later this\nsection.

While the timing precision of future timing arrays is\nsomewhat uncertain, it is instructive to consider a numerical\nexample. Lets assume T = 5yr (i.e., the 10-year duration of\nthe experiment), N = 250 (i.e., roughly bi-weekly timingresidual measurements), Np = 20 isotropically-distributed\npulsars (this is the current number of clocked millisecond pulsars), and \u03c3a = 100ns (this sensitivity is currently\nachieved for only\n\u221a several pulsars). Then for optimal arrival\ntime t0 = \u00b1T / 5, the array sensitivity is\nFor a binary consisting of two black holes of the mass M ,\nthe memory jump is estimated in F09 to be\nM\n108 M\u2299\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n109 light-years\nR\n\n\u0013\n\n, (36)\n\nwhere \u03b7 \u223c 0.05 is the direction-dependent numerical parameter.

The error \u03c3h0 diverges when p = 0, i.e. when t0 =\n\u00b1T . This is as expected: when the memory jump arrives at\nthe beginning or at the end of the timing-array experiment,\nit gets entirely fitted out when the pulsar spin frequency is\ndetermined, and is thus undetectable.\n2. Naively, one may expect the optimal sensitivity when\nthe jump arrives exactly in the middle of the experiment's\ntime interval, i.e. when t0 = 0. This is \u221a\nnot so; the optimal\nsensitivity is achieved for t0 /T = \u00b11/ 5 when the error\nequals\n\nr\n\n(34)\n\n4.1\n\nFor an array consisting of multiple pulsars, and with the\nassumption that the timing residuals are obtained for all\nof them during each of the N observing runs, the above\nexpression for \u03c3h0 is modified as follows:\n\ns\n\np\n\n\u03c3eff = \u03c3\n\n(29)\n\nHere N = 2T /\u2206t is the number of measurements, and\n2\n\nsame amplitude of timing/receiver noise \u03c3a = \u03c3, the \u03c3eff in\nEq.

We assume that\nthe observations are taken tri-weekly over a time-span of 10\nyears. The pulsar timing noise was set to 100 ns white noise.\n2) A gravitational-wave memory signal was added according\nto Eq. (5), with a memory-jump arrival time set to be optimal for sensitivity: tT0 = \u221a15 . The direction and polarisation\nof the gravitational-wave memory signal were chosen randomly - the coordinates happened to have declination 90o .\nIn the following subsections we describe tests which have\nfixed parameters for step 1, but systematically varied amplitude for step 2, and we use these tests to study the sensitivity of the array.\n5.1\nFigure 1.

The scaling has been chosen such\nthat a value of 1 indicates that the same sensitivity for that source\nposition would have been achieved with a perfect isotropic PTA\n(i.e. B 2 = 16 )\n\nFigure 2. The relative sensitivity \u03c3eff for the pulsars of the\nParkes Pulsar Timing Array. The scaling has been chosen such\nthat a value of 1 indicates that the same sensitivity for that source\nposition would have been achieved with a perfect isotropic PTA\n(i.e. B 2 = 61 )\n\nHere we have assumed that all pulsars have equal timing precision. \u03c6s and \u03b8s are the position angles of the gravitationalwave memory source, and \u03b8a is the polar angle of pulsar a\nin a coordinate system with (\u03c6s , \u03b8s ) at the north-pole. In\nfigure 1 and 2 the sensitivity to different gravitational-wave\nmemory source positions is shown for respectively the European Pulsar Timing Array and the Parkes Pulsar Timing\nArray projects.\n\n5\n\nTESTS USING MOCK DATA\n\nWe test the array's sensitivity to gravitational-wave memory signals using mock timing residuals for a number of millisecond pulsars. In this whole section, all the mock timing\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nUsed models\n\nIn principle, we would like to realistically extrapolate the results we obtain here for mock datasets to future real datasets\nfrom PTA projects. Several practical notes are in order to\njustify the models we use here to analyse the mock datasets:\n1) From equation (24) onward, we assume that the\nsystematic-error contributions to the timing residuals consist only of the quadratic spindown. In reality, pulsar observers must fit many model parameters to the data, and\nhave developed appropriate fitting routines within timing\npackages like tempo2. Similar to the quadratic spindown discussed in this paper, all the parameters of the timing model\nare linear or linearised in tempo2, and therefore those parameters are of known functional form. Since the subtraction\nof quadratic spindown decreases the sensitivity of the PTA\nto gravitational-wave memory signals, we would expect the\nsame thing to be true for the rest of the timing model.\n2) The error-bars on the pulse arrival time obtained from\ncorrelating the measured pulse-profile with the template of\nthe pulse-profile are generally not completely trusted. Many\npulsar astronomers invoke an extra \"fudge\" factor that adjusts the error-bars on the timing-residuals to make sure that\nthe errors one gets on the parameters of the timing-model\nare not underestimated. Usually the \"fudge\" factor, which\nis known as an ef ac value is set to the value which makes\nthe reduced \u03c72 of the timing solution to be equal to 1.\nIn order to check the significance of both limitations 1\n& 2, we perform the following test. We take a realistic set\nof pulsars with realistic timing models: the pulsar positions\nand timing models of the PPTA pulsars. We then simulate\nwhite timing-residuals and a gravitational-wave memory signal with amplitude h0 = 10\u221215 , and we produce the posterior distribution of Eq. (11) in three different ways:\na) We marginalise over only the quadratic functions of\nEq. (26), which should yield the result of Eq. (31).\nb) We marginalise over the all timing model parameters included in the tempo2 analysis when producing the timingresiduals.\nc) We marginalise over all the timing model parameters,\nand we also marginalise over the efac values using the numerical techniques of vHLML. By estimating the efac value\nsimultaneously with the gravitational-wave memory signal,\nwe are able to completely separate the two effects. Note that\nthis procedure will not destroy information about the relative size of the error-bars for timing-residuals of the same\npulsar.\n\n\f6\n\nvan Haasteren and Levin\nSensitivity to GW-memory\n1\nMarginalise over quadratics\nMarginalise over complete timing-model\nMarginalise over timing model and efacs\n\nMarginalised posterior distribution for GW-memory signal\n1\n\nGW-Memory metric perturbation []\n\nPosterior / Max(Posterior)\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n4e-15\n0.8\n2e-15\n0.6\n0\n0.4\n-2e-15\n0.2\n\n-4e-15\n\n0.2\n-6e-15\n\n0\n-4\n\n0\n-4e-15\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nStarting time signal [yr]\n-3e-15\n\n-2e-15\n\n-1e-15\n\n0\n\n1e-15\n\n2e-15\n\n3e-15\n\n4e-15\n\n5e-15\n\nAmplitude of GW-memory signal\n\nFigure 3.

The marginalised posterior distribution for the\ngravitational-wave memory signal amplitude and arrival time of\nthe jump. In this case a dataset was analysed that did not contain\nany gravitational-wave memory signal.\n\nWe present the result of this analysis in Figure 3. Based\non the 185 observations per pulsar in the dataset and the direction of the gravitational-wave memory signal, we can calculate the theoretical sensitivity of the array using Eq. (33)\nand Eq. (34). This yields a value of:\n\nIn Figure 4 we show the result of an analysis of a dataset\nwhere we have not added any gravitational-wave memory\nsignal to the timing-residuals. The 3 \u2212 \u03c3 contour is drawn,\nwhich serves as an upper-limit to the memory amplitude.\nWe see that we can exclude a gravitational-wave memory\nsignal at tT0 = \u221a15 of amplitude 3 \u00d7 10\u221215 and higher. We\nsee that this value is over a factor of 4 higher than what is\npredicted by Eq. (42). This is to be expected, since:\n1) We give a 3 \u2212 \u03c3 limit here, instead of the 1 \u2212 \u03c3 sensitivity.\n2) We also marginalise over the arrival time and other parameters of the memory signal, reducing the sensitivity.\nBecause of these reasons, we argue that the minimal upperlimit one can set on the gravitational-wave memory signal using a specific PTA is the sensitivity calculated using\nEq. (42) multiplied by 4.\nNext we produce a set of timing-residuals with a memory signal of amplitude h0 = 10\u221215 . According the result\nmentioned above, the memory signal should not be resolvable with this timing precision. The result is shown in Figure 5. We see that we can indeed merely set an upper-limit\nagain. In order to check the effect of marginalising over the\nefac values as mentioned in section 5.1, we also perform an\nanalysis where we pretend we do know the efac values prior\nto the analysis. The result is shown in Figure 6. We see no\nsignificant difference between the two models.\nFinally, we also analyse a dataset with a gravitationalwave memory signal with an amplitude larger than the 3 \u00d7\n10\u221215 upper-limit of the white set mentioned above. Here we\nhave added a memory signal with an amplitude of 10\u221214 . In\nFigure 7 we see that we have a definite detection of the\nsignal: if we consider the 3 \u2212 \u03c3 contours, we see that we can\nrestrict\nthe gravitational-wave\nmemory amplitude between\n\u0002\n\u0003\n6.6 \u00d7 10\u221215 , 1.35 \u00d7 10\u221214 . Again, this value is higher than\nthe value predicted by Eq. (42) due to us including more\nparameters in the model than just the memory amplitude. In\nFigure 8 we see that we can also reliably resolve the position\nof the source in this case.\n\n2 2 ln 2\n\n\u03c3h0 = 6.4 \u00d7 10\u221216 .\n\n(42)\n\nWe can also calculate this value for the three graphs in Figure 3. The three graphs lie close enough on top of each other\nto conclude that one value applies to all three of them:\n\u03c3h0 = 6.5 \u00d7 10\u221216 ,\n\n(43)\n\nwhich is in good agreement with the theoretical value. It\nappears that both note 1 and 2 mentioned above are not of\ngreat influence to the sensitivity of PTAs to gravitationalwave memory detection; the theoretical calculations of this\npaper are a good representation of the models mentioned in\nthis section.\n5.2\n\nUpper-limits and detecting the signal\n\nWhen there is no detectable gravitational-wave memory signal present in the data, we can set some upper-limit on the\nsignal amplitude using the algorithm presented in this paper.\nHere we will analyse datasets with no or no fully detectable\ngravitational-wave memory signal in it, and a dataset with a\nwell-detectable signal using the MCMC method of vHLML.\nWe will calculate the marginalised posterior distributions\nfor the 5 parameters of the gravitational-wave memory signal. The interesting parameters in the case of an upperlimit are the amplitude and the arrival time of the jump.\nA marginalised posterior for those two parameters are then\npresented as two-dimensional posterior plots. Note that the\ndifference with the analysis in section 5.1 is that we vary\nall gravitational-wave memory parameters, instead of only\nthe amplitude. Note that we do marginalise over all the efac\nvalues as discussed in section 5.1, unless stated otherwise.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fmemory and pulsar timing arrays\n\nMarginalised posterior distribution for GW-memory signal\n\nMarginalised posterior distribution for GW-memory signal\n1\n\n3e-14\n\n1\n\n2.5e-14\n\n4e-15\n0.8\n2e-15\n0.6\n0\n0.4\n-2e-15\n0.2\n\n-4e-15\n\nGW-Memory metric perturbation []\n\nGW-Memory metric perturbation []\n\n7\n\n0.8\n2e-14\n1.5e-14\n\n0.6\n\n1e-14\n0.4\n\n5e-15\n0\n\n0.2\n-5e-15\n\n-6e-15\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n-1e-14\n\n0\n-2.5\n\nStarting time signal [yr]\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nStarting time signal [yr]\n\nFigure 5.

How frequently do these mergers occur during\nthe PTA lifetime? Recent calculations of Sesana et al. (2007,\nSVH) are not too encouraging. SVH compute, for several\nmodels of SMBH merger trees, the rate of SMBH mergers\nas seen on Earth, as a function of mass (their figure 1d), as\nwell as a multidute of other parameters for these mergers.\nFrom their plots one infers few\u00d710\u22122 \u221210\u22123 PTA-observable\nmergers per year, which converts to at most 0.1 \u2212 0.01 detected mergers during the PTA lifetime of \u223c 10 years (NB:\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 8. The marginalised posterior distribution for the sky\nlocation of the gravitational-wave memory signal. We can see here\nthat we can marginally determine the direction of the source. The\nsource positions used to generate the residuals were: (declination,\nright ascension) = (900 , 12.4hr).\n\nduring the PTA existence, only a fraction of time will spent\nnear the arrival times with optimal sensitivity). It is conceivable that SVH estimates are on the conservative side, since\nthe mergers of heavy black holes may be stalled (due to the\n\"last parsec\" problem) and may occur at a significantly later\ntime than the mergers of their host halos. In this case, some\nfraction of high-redshift mergers may be pushed towards\nlower redshifts and become PTA-detectable. Detailed calculations are needed to find out whether this process could\nsubstantially increase the rate of PTA-detectable mergers.\nIt is also worth pointing out that a futuristic PTA experiment based on a Square Kilometer Array may attain up to\nan order of magnitude higher sensitivity that the currently\ndeveloped PTAs.\nThe methods presented in this paper are useful be-\n\n\f8\n\nvan Haasteren and Levin\n\nyond the particular application that we discuss. The algorithm presented here is suitable for any single-source detection in general when the gravitational waveform has known\nfunctional form. Further applications will be presented elsewhere.\n6.1\n\ncomparison with other work\n\nWhen this paper was already finished, a preprint by\nPshirkov et al. (2009, PBP) has appeared on the arxiv which\nhas carried out a similar analysis to the one presented here.\nOur expressions for the signal-to-noise ratio for the memory jump agree for the case of the white pulsar noise. PBPs\ntreatment of cosmology is more detailed than ours, while the\nmoderately pessimistic predicted detection rates are broadly\nconsistent between the 2 papers. Our method for signal extraction is more generally applicable than PBS's since it is\noptimized for any spectral type of pulsar noise, takes into\nconsideration not just the signal magnitude but also other\nsignal parameters, and is tested on mock data.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research is supported by the Netherlands organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) through VIDI grant\n639.042.607.\n\nREFERENCES\nBlanchet L., Damour T., 1992, Phys.
