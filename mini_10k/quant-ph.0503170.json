This fact does not\ndiminish the utility of CM in describing the behavior\nof macroscopic objects. But theoretical consistency demands that the observed classical phenomena should also\nemerge from QM in an appropriate limit. However, a detailed understanding of this quantum-to-classical (QC)\nlimit is remarkably difficult to achieve, and the origin of\nclassical behavior is even subject to a degree of controversy. There has been some confusion as to which QM\nstructures should be compared with classical predictions,\nand hence to what the appropriate criterion for classicality should be. The role that decoherence due to environmental perturbations might play in establishing the QC\nlimit is also controversial.\nA criterion for classicality that has often been used\nis based on Ehrenfest's theorem [1]. If the size of the\nquantum state is small compared to the scale on which\nthe potential energy varies, then the centroid of the state\nwill approximately follow a classical Newtonian trajectory. The time duration (and range of other relevant\nparameters) within which this condition holds is referred\nto as the Ehrenfest regime. Since any wave packet will\neventually spread until it reaches the size of the system\n(harmonic oscillators being a unique exception), it follows\nthat this criterion for classicality will eventually fail, no\nmatter how macroscopic the system may be. If the break\ntime when this occurs were as long as the age of the solar system, there would be no cause for concern. But in\nchaotic systems, the size of a wave packet grows exponen-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ballenti@sfu.ca\n\ntially, and the break time can be quite small. A striking\nexample, given by Zurek [2], is the chaotic tumbling of\nHyperion (a moon of Saturn), for which the Ehrenfest criterion for classicality will fail in less than 20 years. Zurek\nargues that environmental decoherence can remove this\nparadox and restore classical behavior to Hyperion. This\nclaim is certainly not correct, as long as the Ehrenfest\ncriterion for classicality is used. However, we propose\nanother criterion for classicality, within which the role of\ndecoherence will be reassessed.\nThe origin of the above paradox consists in a failing to\ntake proper account of the statistical nature of QM. It is\nnot correct to identify the trajectory of a body with the\nmotion of the centroid of the wave function. QM does\nnot describe the actual observed phenomenon, but only\nthe probabilities of the various possible phenomena. We\nshould, therefore, compare quantum probabilities with\nclassical probabilities. This leads us to define the Liouville regime of quantum- classical correspondence, within\nwhich the quantum probabilities are approximately equal\nto the classical probabilities that satisfy the Liouville\nequation. There is no requirement that the probability distributions be narrow, and so the Liouville regime\nof classicality is usually much larger than the Ehrenfest\nregime.\nThe superiority of the Liouville criterion for classicality to the Ehrenfest criterion has been demonstrated in\nseveral ways. One way to see this is through the correction terms to Ehrenfest's theorem. When the width\nof the state is small but not negligible, these corrections\ncan be obtained as a series involving the variance and\nhigher moments of the position probability distribution\n[3]. This series has exactly the same form for the classical Liouville probability distribution. Hence Ehrenfest's\ntheorem merely asserts that if the (quantum or classical)\nprobability distribution is sufficiently narrow, its centroid\n\n\f2\nwill follow a Newtonian trajectory. To leading order, the\ndeviations from the Newtonian trajectory are the same in\nboth the quantum and classical cases, and so those deviations are not primarily quantal in origin. The magnitude\nof the deviations from Ehrenfest's theorem depends primarily on the width of the initial state in configuration\nspace, and has no systematic dependence on ~ [4]. However, the (much smaller) differences between the quantum and classical probabilities scale as ~2 , indicating that\nthey are truly of quantal origin.\nOur interest in Hyperion was stimulated by Zurek's\nprovocative paper [2]. He begins with an estimate of the\nbreak time, TE , beyond which the Ehrenfest criterion of\nclassicality will fail. Since the width of a wave packet in\na chaotic system grows exponentially with the Lyapunov\nexponent \u03bb, the time taken for it to reach the scale L\nover which the potential varies (typically of order of the\nsystem size) will be TE = \u03bb\u22121 ln(L/\u2206x0 ), where \u2206x0\nis the initial width of the wave packet. Zurek chooses\n\u2206x0 = \u2206p0 /~, with the width of the momentum distribution \u2206p0 being estimated from thermal fluctuations, and\nthereby obtains the now-familiar result that the break\ntime TE scales as ln(~\u22121 ). This TE can be quite short,\neven for a macroscopic system, and because of the logarithmic dependence, it is not sensitive to detailed assumptions about the initial state. Thus, according to the\nEhrenfest criterion for classicality, the tumbling motion\nof Hyperion should long ago have ceased to be classical.\nThis paradoxical conclusion is not affected by including environmental decoherence. Decoherence converts a\npure state into a mixed state, but it does not produce\nlocalization of the position probability density, and so it\nhas no significant influence on the breakdown of Ehrenfest's theorem. (Indeed, the diffusive term that describes\nthe effect of the environment in the master equation for\nthe density matrix will have a slight delocalizing effect.)\nTherefore, if the Ehrenfest criterion were the sole criterion for classicality, we would still be faced with the\nparadoxical conclusion that macroscopic bodies like Hyperion should be grossly non-classical.\nIn [2, 5] Zurek next considers the equation of motion of the Wigner function, which has the form of the\nclassical Liouville equation plus a series of ~-dependent\nterms, called the Moyal terms. The limit of the Liouville\nregime of classicality will presumably be reached when\nthe Moyal terms have a significant effect. Unfortunately,\nZurek does not distinguish between the Ehrenfest and Liouville regimes, and denotes both break times as t~ . This\nis a serious confusion, since they are both conceptually\nand numerically distinct.\nWhile the time limit TE of the Ehrenfest regime is\neasy to estimate reliably, an analogous limit for the Liouville regime is much more difficult to obtain. Zurek uses\nheuristic arguments to claim that decoherence tends to\ncounter the effects of the Moyal terms, and he obtains a\nLiouville break time similar in form to TE [5]. We consider this conclusion to be doubtful for several reasons.\nHabib et al. [6] have shown that, in order for the non-\n\nZ\n\nX\n\na\n\nq\nr(t)\n\nf-q\nFIG. 1: Orbit of satellite spinning about the z-axis perpendicular to the orbital plane. \u03b8 denotes the position of the\nsatellite on the orbit, and \u03c6 is the orentation of the satellite\nwith respect to the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nnegativity of the density matrix (\"rho-positivity\" in their\nterminology) to be preserved, the Moyal terms must have\nsubtle effects that are not counteracted by decoherence.\nFull numerical computations for a driven system [7] and\nfor an autonomous system [8] have found that, although\nthe differences between quantum and classical averages\nof observables have a brief period of exponential growth,\nthese differences reach a saturation value, about which\nthey fluctuate irregularly. This saturation value is much\nsmaller than the system size (unlike the deviations from\nEhrenfest's theorem), and it tends to zero as some small\npower of ~. The break time estimated by Zurek would\nbe relevant only if the exponential growth of these QC\ndifferences continued until they reached macroscopic size.\nIn this paper we perform classical and quantum computations for the chaotic tumbling of an object like Hyperion, which complement the published classical theory\n[9]. The actual value of the de Broglie wavelength is, of\ncourse, much too short to be treated in a numerical integration of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. So we cast the equation into dimensionless form, and solve it for a range of\nthe dimensionless ~ parameter. These results lead to scaling relations, from which we can extrapolate to estimate\nthe values appropriate to Hyperion. We study the system\nwith and without environmental decoherence, discuss the\nconditions needed to ensure classicality, as well as examine whether there is a qualtiative difference between the\nclassical limit of regular and chaotic initial states.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nOur model of Hyperion's rotation was first suggested\nin 1988 by Wisdom [9]. It assumes that Hyperion's center of mass travels in an elliptical orbit about Saturn,\nand that its orbit is unaffected by its rotation. However,\nsince Hyperion is an extended object, Saturn's gravitational field is not constant over its volume. Since its mass\n\n\f3\ndistribution is not spherical, the variation in the gravitational field can produce a net torque. To lowest order\nin a multipole expansion of the mass distribution, this\ntorque depends on the quadrupole moment of the mass\ndistribution, and for simplicity we neglect all higher order\nmoments.\nIt should be noted that this configuration is attitude\nunstable, and so small inclinations of I3 towards the plane\nof the orbit will tend to grow. However this simplifying\nassumption makes both the classical and the quantum\nmechanical computations feasible.\nThe coordinate system is shown in Fig. 1. The spacefixed x-axis is along the semi-major axis of the orbital ellipse, and the z-axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane.\nThe angle \u03b8 denotes the position of the satellite in the\norbit. The axis of the smallest moment of inertia (I1 ),\nmakes an angle \u03c6 with respect to the x-axis, hence the\nangle between the body axis of I1 and the radius vector\n~r is \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b8. The largest moment of inertia I3 is parallel\nto the z-axis.

The\n\nThe classical limit of the quantum tumbling of a satellite will now be examined for a non-chaotic state, to determine whether there is a qualitative difference between\nchaotic and non-chaotic systems in their approach to classicality.\nNon-chaotic motion is ensured by choosing a circular\norbit: e = 0, r(\u03c4 ) = a, \u03b8(\u03c4 ) = 2\u03c0\u03c4 . The time dependence\nin Eq.

The distributions of Jz and \u03c6 are found by randomly choosing the angular momentum and orientation\nof each member of the ensemble from probability distributions in Jz and \u03c6 that correspond to the initial quantum state.\nThe finiteness of the ensemble leads to statistical errors, which may be reduced by increasing its size.

It is centered at J0 = 4, with a standard\ndeviation in Jz of \u03c3 = \u221a12 (see Fig. 2), and a central\nanglei \u03c60 equal to zero.\n\nHere n is the number of members in the ensemble, \u03c3 is\nthe standard deviation of the distribution. Any difference\nbetween the computed mean values of the quantum and\nthe classical variables is not significant unless it is larger\nthan \u03c3m . Ensembles of 1,000,000 to 20,000,000 particles\nwere used to ensure that the typical QC differences are\ngreater than \u03c3m .\nAs \u03b2 \u2192 0 the QC differences become smaller, and thus\na larger ensemble is needed to reduce the statistical errors\nbelow that level. Hence different ensemble sizes were\nused for different values of \u03b2 in Fig. 3. The ensemble\nsizes were chosen so that \u03c3m = {0.0002, 0.0007, 0.002}\nfor \u03b2 = {0.0125, 0.05, 0.5}.\nEnsembles were evolved for several values of \u03b2, ranging\nfrom \u03b2 = 0.5 to \u03b2 = 0.002. For \u03b2 < 0.01 the QC differences were far smaller than \u03c3m for any computationally\nfeasible ensemble sizes, so no data will be presented for\n\u03b2 < 0.01.\nA plot of the QC differences in hJz i is shown in Fig.\n\n\f6\n1.

This lack of\npointwise convergence of the quantum probability distributions to the classical limit has also been observed for\nother systems, such as a particle in a box and the kicked\nrotor [13]. In these one-dimensional driven system, the\nquantum probability distributions develop a fractal-like\nstructure, and only the smooth background converges to\nthe classical probability distribution. We will show in\nsection V C that a similar result holds for Hyperion.\nFIG. 6: Variation of |qm \u2212 cl|1 [Eq. (19)] with time and \u03b2 for\nthe nonchaotic state (e = 0, \u03b1 = 0.5).

In this and similar figures, any QC differences smaller\nthan \u03c3m should be ignored, since they are dominated\nby statistical errors. The QC differences oscillate on the\nscale of the driving force, and only the envelope of these\noscillations is of interest. From Fig. 3 it is apparent that\nat early times the envelope of the QC differences grows as\n\u03c4 2 . For longer times the envelope of the QC differences\nis oscillatory, as can be seen in Fig. 4. Such recurrences\nare typical for non-chaotic systems [12]. Fig. 5 shows\nthat, for fixed times, the QC differences in hJz i scale as\n\u03b2 2 . This result is similar to that found for some other\nsystems [4].\n\nB.\n\nQC Differences in Distributions\n\nThe differences in hJz i alone are insufficient to fully describe the differences between quantum and classical systems because two different probability distributions can\nhave the same mean but different variances and higher\nmoments. We shall now examine the differences between\nprobability distributions, and how they scale with \u03b2.\nSince the angular momentum distributions are discrete, one can regard them as vectors, and measure the\ndifference between the quantum and classical probability\nvectors by the 1-norm, defined as\n|qm \u2212 cl|1 =\n\nX\nm\n\n|Pcl (m) \u2212 Pqm (m)|\n\n(19)\n\nThis\nprobability distribution is normalized so that\nP\na probabilm P (m) = 1. Alternatively, one can define\nR\nity density, which is normalized so that P\u0303 (~m)d(~m) =\n\nFIG. 7: Poincare Section for a chaotic state, \u03b1 = 0.5, e = 0.1.\nBlack circle denotes a typical initial state, with Jz = 10 and\n\u03b4 = 0.5\n\nIn this section the rotation of a satellite is investigated\nfor a chaotic state. The previous value of \u03b1 = 0.5 is used,\nbut now the eccentricity is taken to be Hyperion's value\nof e = 0.1. The computation is carried out as in section\nIII.\nThe initial state is centered at dimensionless angular\nmomentum J0 = 10, with a standard deviation of \u03c3 =\n0.5, and a central angle \u03c60 = 0. This state is in the\n\n\f7\njectories ergodically fill the chaotic sea. For \u03c4 > 20 the\nclassical ensemble saturates at hJz i \u2248 8.2. The quantum\nvalue of hJz i also saturates at approximately the same\nvalue, but with irregular fluctuations superimposed. This\nsuggests that the QC differences here are dominated by\nquantum fluctuations, once the probability distributions\nhave saturated the chaotic sea.\nA.\n\nFIG. 8: QC differences in hJz i vs \u03c4 for a chaotic state, \u03b1 =\n0.5, e = 0.1. For \u03b2 = {1 \u00d7 10\u22123 , 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 , 8 \u00d7 10\u22123 } the\nstatistical errors are \u03c3m = {1.4\u00d710\u22124 , 1.4\u00d710\u22124 , 2.2\u00d710\u22124 }.\n\nQC Differences in hJz i for Early Times\n\nTo determine how the QC differences scale with \u03b2, we\nvaried \u03b2 with \u03c4 fixed at the times of the peaks in Fig.\n8. From Fig. 9 it can be seen that the QC differences in\nhJz i scale as \u03b2 2 ; the same scaling as was found for the\nnon-chaotic states. This \u03b2 2 scaling was previously found\nby a different method for other systems [4]. The classical\nensemble sizes were chosen so that \u03c3m = {1.6\u00d710\u22124, 1.6\u00d7\n10\u22124 , 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 } for \u03b2 = {1 \u00d7 10\u22123 , 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 , 8 \u00d7 10\u22123 }.\nIn the initial growth region of Fig. 8,the QC differences\nin hJz i vary with time as\n|hJz iQ \u2212 hJz iC | \u221d e2.9\u03c4\n\n(21)\n\nfor \u03c4 = 2 between 2 and 5.5. The exponent in Eq. (21)\nappears to be independent of the value of \u03b2. The exponent is greater than 2\u03bb, implying that the QC differences\ngrow at a rate that is greater than the classical Lyapunov\nexponent. Similar results have been obtained for some\nother systems [4, 7, 14].\nThe exponential growth eventually saturates. This cessation of exponential growth of the QC differences in hJz i\nis relevant to Zurek's argument [2] that, absent decoherence, the QC differences for Hyperion should reach\nmacroscopic size within about 20 years. That argument\nimplicitly assumes that the QC differences will continue\nto grow exponentially until they reach the size of the\nsystem. However, we find that not to be the case.\nB.\n\nFIG. 9: QC differences in hJz i vs \u03b2, for a chaotic state before\nsaturation is reached, showing a \u03b2 2 dependence.\n\nchaotic sea, far away from any regular torii, as can be\nseen in Figure 7. The maximum Lyapunov exponent for\nthe chaotic sea is \u03bb = 0.85.\nThis state was evolved for several periods of the driving\nforce, and the differences between the quantum and classical results were computed. In Fig. 8 the QC differences\nin hJz i are initially dominated by statistical errors, which\nare approximately \u03c3m = 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 . The QC differences\nin hJz i grow exponentially with time until they saturate\nat \u03c4 \u2248 6. This saturation occurs when the classical tra-\n\nQC Differences in hJz i for the Saturation\nRegime\n\nThe maximum QC differences occurs in the saturation\nregime. If these differences converge to 0 as \u03b2 \u2192 0 then\nthe classical limit will be reached for all times, and there\nwill be no break time beyond which QC correspondence\nfails.\nAt the beginning of the saturation region (Fig. 8 and\nFig. 15), the QC differences in hJz i reach a maximum,\nbefore decaying to a saturation level, about which they\nfluctuate irregularly. Because of this fluctuation in the\nsaturation regime, we calculate the time average of the\nQC differences. Here |hJz iQ \u2212 hJz iC | was averaged over\n\u03c4 from 20 to 100. As shown in Figure 11, these averaged\nQC differences tend to scale as \u03b2 2/3 .\nFor sufficiently small \u03b2, the peak QC differences also\nscales as \u03b2 2/3 (see Fig. 10). This scaling also was found\nfor the maximum QC differences in a model of coupled\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 10: Maximum QC differences in hJz i versus \u03b2 for a\nchaotic state. e = 0.1, \u03b1 = 0.5.

Suggests that h|hJz iQ \u2212 hJz iC |i \u221d \u03b2 2/3 in the saturation\nregime.\n\nFIG. 12: Quantum probability density for \u03c4 = 40.0, \u03b2 = 0.002\n\nprobability distributions are shown in Figures 12 and 19.\nWe use the quantity |qm \u2212 cl|1 (defined in Eq. (19)) as\na measure of the QC differences in the probabilities.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 14, |qm \u2212 cl|1 increases with\ntime before saturating, but fails to converge to 0 as \u03b2 \u2192\n0. Since pointwise convergence does not occur, neither\nfor the chaotic nor for the non-chaotic states, this lack of\npointwise convergence is not a result of chaos.\nMost of the QC differences in the probabilities occur\non a very fine scale, and a modest amount of smoothing\nis sufficient to cause the quantum probability distributions to better approximate the classical results. Fig.\n13 shows that the differences between the two distributions are dramatically reduced by smoothing them over\na small width. This smoothing process is discussed and\ncompared to environmental decoherence in section V C.\nTo summarize the results of this section, for early times\nthe QC differences in hJz i scale as \u03b2 2 , and increase exponentially with time. The exponential growth ceases\nwhen the probability distributions saturate the chaotic\nsea. Both the maximum values and the saturation levels\nof the QC differences were found to scale as \u03b2 2/3 . A small\namount of smoothing can dramatically reduce the QC\ndifferences in the probability distributions, since most of\nthe differences come from very fine scale structures in the\nquantum probability distributions.\n\npendulums [8], so it might be generic for chaotic systems\nin the saturation regime.\nV.\nC.\n\nQC Differences in Probability Distributions\n\nThe probability distributions contain much more information than do the averages of observables. These\n\nENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS\n\nInteraction with the environment leads to decoherence\nand dissipation. Decoherence is a quantum effect that\ncauses interference patterns to decay.

Strunz et al. [16] suggest that for the rapid decoherence expected in macroscopic bodies, the decay time\nvaries as a small power of ~, and is not sensitive to the\nsystem Hamiltonian.\nDissipation is a classical effect which results in diffusive spreading of the probability distributions. Often,\nthe timescale for dissipation is much longer than the\ntimescale for decoherence, and dissipation is insensitive\nto ~, unlike decoherence. But both effects are present\n\nFIG. 15: Variation of hJz i with \u03c4 with and without the random potential with \u03c3/Vch = 0.024, \u03c4c = 0.01.

Because an initially pure state can evolve\ninto a mixed state, it is necessary to compute the density\nmatrix, which requires much greater storage than does\nthe computation of a state vector. The requirements for\nstorage and computation time scale like K 2 , where K is\nthe number of basis vectors needed to store a state vector.\n\n\f10\nneeded to get sufficient accuracy was considerably less\nthan K, so this method was much more computationally\nefficient than integrating the master equation.\nA stochastic potential is included, in both the quantum and classical mechanics, to model the effect of the\nenvironment on the satellite. The simplest stochastic potential that yields a random torque is\nHint = V0 R(t) cos(\u03c6)\n\nFIG. 17: |qm \u2212 cl|1 vs \u03c4 for \u03b2 = 0.05, for varying D = \u03c3 2 \u03c4c /6.\n\nFIG. 18: |qm \u2212 cl|1 vs \u03c4 for varying \u03b2, with \u03c4c = 0.01 and\n\u03c3/Vch = 0.012, for a chaotic state.\n\nAn alternative method is to perform n evolutions of Eq.\n(15) with a different realization of the random potential\nadded for each run. Averaging the probability distributions that result from the each of the n runs is physically\nequivalent to tracing over the environmental variables.\nThe advantage of this method is that the computational\nresources for each run scale as K, rather than K 2 for the\nmaster equation. On the other hand, to achieve good\naccuracy, a large number of realizations of the random\npotential must be considered, in order to reduce the statistical errors in the quantum calculation. However the\nnumber of realizations of the random potential that was\n\n(22)\n\nHere R(t) is a correlated random function of zero mean\nand unit variance, V0 is the amplitude of the random\npotential, and \u03c4c is its correlation time. A correlated\nrandom function is used because the fluctuations in the\nenvironment do not occur instantly, but rather they occur\nand decay on some time scale \u03c4c . The correlated random\nsequence R(t) can be constructed from an uncorrelated\nsequence, as is shown in Appendix A. The results are not\nsensitive to the exact form of Eq. (22), and qualitatively\nsimilar results were obtained when cos(\u03c6) was replaced\nby cos(2\u03c6). As is shown in Appendices B and C, the effects of the environment are expected to depend mainly\non the product \u03c3 2 \u03c4c , rather than on the two parameters\nseparately. Therefore we label the results by the momentum diffusion parameter, D = \u03c3 2 \u03c4c /6, which is derived\nin Appendix B.\nThe environmental perturbation should be much\nweaker than the tidal force on the satellite. Hence we\ncompare the interaction potential Eq. (22) to the amplitude of the tidal potential, made\u221a\ndimensionless by dividing by I3 /T 2 , which is Vch = 3 2\u03c0 2 \u03b1, or Vch \u2248 21\nfor \u03b1 = 0.5. In all cases reported in this paper, the\nenvironmental perturbation was so weak as to have no\nsignificant effect on the classical results, so its only significant effect is to produce decoherence in the quantum\nresults. The same parameters as in the previous chaotic\ncase were used, \u03b1 = 0.5 and e = 0.1.\nMany realizations of the random potential were computed, and the results averaged, to get an accurate measure of the effects of the environment. We used 500 realizations to obtain results that are not strongly affected\nby statistical errors. Fig. 15 shows the QC differences in\nhJz i, with and without the random environmental potential. The environment has no significant effect at early\ntimes, but in the saturation regime the QC differences are\nreduced. Since the primary effect of environmental decoherence is to destroy fine-scale structures in the probability distributions, which do not affect averages like hJz i,\nthis result may seem surprising. In fact, a typical trace\nof hJz i versus time for a single realization of the random potential will look very much like that from a run\nwithout the random potential in Fig. 15. But as time\nprogresses, the oscillations in hJz i for different realizations of the random potential tend to get out of phase\nwith each other, and the decreased amplitudes of the QC\ndifferences in Fig. 15 are due to the averaging over the\nmany different realizations of the random potential.\nIn Fig. 16, 100 realizations of the interaction potential\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 19: Quantum and Classical probability distributions at \u03c4 = 40, with \u03b2 = 0.0125, \u03c3/Vch = 0.012, and \u03c4c = 0.01 for the\nchaotic state. In (b) the solid lines denote the results with the environment, and squares without the environment, showing\nthat the classical probability distribution is not significantly affected by the environment.\n\ndistribution is much closer to the classical distribution\nthan without the environment (compare Fig. 12).\n\nA.\n\nFIG. 20: Decay times \u03c4d of |qm\u2212cl|1 vs the correlation time \u03c4c\nof the perturbing environment, with \u03b2 = 0.05, \u03c3/Vch = 0.012,\nin the saturation regime (\u03b1 = 0.5, e = 0.1)\n\nwere sufficient to find the maximum QC differences in\n|qm \u2212 cl|1 (Eq. (19)). However, 700 realizations of the\ninteraction potential were insufficient to resolve the QC\ndifferences in |qm \u2212 cl|1 in the saturation regime, and so\nfor computational reasons, these will be estimated rather\nthan directly computed. The variation of these differences with \u03b2 and the environmental parameters can be\nseen in Figures. 17 and 18.\nIt can be seen in Fig. 19 that, with the inclusion of\nthe environmental perturbation, the quantum probability\n\nEnvironmental Effects in the Saturation Regime\n\nIn the saturation regime, the QC differences in |qm \u2212\ncl|1 (Eq. (19)) appear to decay exponentially from their\nmaximum value to a saturation level (see Fig. 17 and\n18). The rate of this decay is a duffusion time, and is not\nthe decoherence time, as will be shown shortly. From\nFig. 20 it is clear that, for sufficiently large values of \u03c4c ,\nthe decay time \u03c4d no longer depends on \u03c4c , but settles at\n\u03c4d \u2248 5.6. For sufficiently large \u03c3 and sufficiently small\n\u03b2, the decay time was found to also have approximately\nthis same limit.\nTo test whether this decay rate is governed by quantum\nmechanics, we compared two classical ensembles with different initial values of J0 (J0 = 10 and J0 = 11), and\ncomputed the 1-norm of the difference between them as\na function of time. Fig. 21 shows that these initially\ndifferent classical ensembles converge at a rate given by\n\u03c4d = 5.6. So, apparently, this time scale measures how\nquickly the differences between two different distributions\ndecrease as they both grow to fill the chaotic sea.\nIt is not clear from Fig. 17 and 18 whether the QC\ndifferences in the probability distributions eventually decrease to zero or reach a non-zero long-time limit. In Fig.\n22 the long-time saturation level of |qm \u2212 cl|1 is plotted\nas a function of the number n of realizations of the random potential. In the limit n \u2192 \u221e the QC differences\napproach a small value that appears to be slightly positive. However that extrapolated limit is substantially\nsmaller than the typical statistical errors for ensemble\nsizes of 1,000,000 to 2,000,000, and so is not significantly\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 21: 1-norm of the difference between two classical ensembles, one with hJz i = 10, the other hJz i = 11. \u03b2 = 0.05,\n\u03c3/Vch = 0.012, \u03c4c = 0.01\n\nFIG. 23: Maximum values of |qm \u2212 cl|1 vs \u03b2 2 /D.

This result suggests that\nthe \u03b2 1/3 scaling found here might be generic for systems\nwith more than one degree of freedom, and also suggests\nthat the pointwise convergence of the quantum probability distribution to the classical distribution may occur\nbecause of other interacting degrees of freedom (not necessarily an external environment).\n\nC.\nFIG. 22: |qm \u2212 cl|1 vs n\u22121/2 at \u03c4 = 40. n is the number of\nrealizations of the random potential.

However, in agreement\n\nEffects of Decoherence vs Smoothing\n\nThe effect of environmental decoherence is analogous\nto applying a smoothing filter to the quantum distributions, but the two effects are not exactly the same. A\nsmall amount of smoothing does not affect the average\nvalues of an observable, whereas decoherence can have\nan effect by dephasing the quantum fluctuation, which\nare then averaged over (see Fig. 15). This effect may be\npeculiar to systems with only one degree of freedom.\nAnother difference is in the scaling of the QC differences with the parameters. Figure 24 shows |qm \u2212 cl|1\nin the saturation regime as a function of \u03b2 and \u2206s ,\nwhere \u2206s is the half width of the triangular filter used\n\n\f13\nthis information to estimate the magnitude of quantum\neffects on Hyperion. In particular, we shall assess Zurek's\nclaim [2, 5] that environmental decoherence is needed\nto ensure its classical behavior. We first examine the\nmagnitude of the QC differences for Hyperion if the effect\nof the environment is ignored.\nFirst we must determine the dimensionless parameter\n\u03b2 = ~T\nI3 . Using Hyperion's mean density of \u03c1 = 1.4 g\n\u22123\ncm , and treating it as an ellipsoid with moments of\ninertia I3 > I2 > I1 , then I3 = 2.1 \u00d7 1029 kg m2 . Using\nthe value of ~ = 1.05 \u00d7 10\u221234 J s, and the orbital period\nT = 1.8 \u00d7 106 s, then yields\n\u03b2 = 9.3 \u00d7 10\u221258\n\nFIG. 24: |qm \u2212 cl|1 for smoothed probability distributions\nfor varying \u03c3m and \u03b2 in the saturation regime (\u03c4 = 20).\n\nto smooth the quantum distribution. In the saturation\nregime, |qm \u2212 cl|1 was found to depend on the single\nparameter \u03b2/\u2206s , where it obeys the scaling relation\n\n|qm \u2212 cl|1 = 0.58\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b2\n\u2206s\n\n\u00130.44\n\n(24)\n\nEq. (24) shows a scaling relationship similar to Eq.\n(23). This may be understood as follows. Environmental\nperturbations cause\n\u221a momentum diffusion. This effect is\nproportional to D, and so \u2206s should be compared to\nD2 . Hence, in the late time limit, smoothing and decoherence rely on a similar composite parameter. However\nthe power laws are different in the two cases, and so the\ntwo processes are not entirely equivalent.\nIn summary, the environmental perturbations were\nfound to drasticly reduce the fine-scale structure in the\nquantum distributions. The measure of the QC differences, |qm \u2212 cl|1 , was found to initially increase with \u03c4\nin a form similar to the results in Sec. IV. After reaching\na maximum value, |qm\u2212cl|1 then decreased exponentially\nwith time. The decay time was found to be a classical\ndiffusion time, and not a decoherence time. The maximum QC differences were found to scale as (\u03b2 2 /D)1/6 ,\nwhere D is the momentum diffusion parameter.\nVI.\nA.\n\nCLASSICAL LIMIT FOR HYPERION\nQC Differences Without Environment\n\nHaving calculated the QC differences for the chaotic\nrotation of a tidally driven satellite, and determined how\nthey scale with the relevant parameters, we shall now use\n\n(25)\n\nIn Sec. IV B it was found that the maximum QC\ndifferences in hJz i scale as \u03b2 2/3 . Hence the maximum\nQC difference in the dimensionless angular momentum\nhJz i for Hyperion should be approximately 5 \u00d7 10\u221237 .\nSo there should be no observable difference between the\nquantum and classical averages of angular momentum for\nHyperion.\nThis result contradicts Zurek's claim that, if decoherence is ignored, there should be a break time of no more\nthan 20 years, beyond which the QC differences would\nbecome macroscopic. As was pointed out in the Introduction, if that break time is interpreted as the limit of\nthe Ehrenfest regime, then it does not mark the end of\nthe classical domain. But in [5] a break time of a similar order of magnitude was estimated for the end of the\nLiouville regime. Both of those estimates were based on\nan exponential growth of the QC differences that occur\nin a chaotic state. Now the deviations from Ehrenfest's\ntheorem do, indeed, grow exponentially until they reach\nthe size of the system, as is needed for Zurek's argument\nto succeed. But, as was shown in Sec. IV(A), the exponential growth of the differences between quantum state\naverages and classical ensemble averages will saturate before those differences reach the size of the system, and the\nsaturation value scales with a small power of ~. Hence,\nfor the actual (small) value of ~, the QC differences in the\nLiouville regime can remain small for all time, and there\nis no effective break time for the regime of classicality.\nThe differences in hJz i become vanishingly small in\nthe classical limit, but this does not imply that the full\nquantum probability distribution converges to the classical limit. We know that the quantum probability distribution will not converge to the classical distribution in\na pointwise fashion. But we can ask what resolution is\nneeded for a detector to be able to discriminate between\nthese two distributions. Let us suppose that two probability distributions are practically indistinguishable when\n|qm \u2212 cl|1 < 0.01. Using scaling result in Fig. 24, we find\nthat a resolution \u2206s of 1 part in 10\u221260 rad/s is needed\nto resolve the two probability distributions. This suggests that it would be practically impossible to observe\nthe quantum effects in the probability distributions, even\nwithout invoking environmental decoherence.\n\n\f14\nB.\n\nEnvironmental Effects on Hyperion\n\nVII.\n\nThere are many environmental perturbations that can\naffect the satellite: random motion of the particles within\nthe satellite, random collisions with interplanetary dust,\nand random light fluctuations from the sun, to name a\nfew. We shall consider the random collisions with dust\nparticles as an example.\nTo do this we treat the interplanetary dust as a dilute\ngas, and Hyperion as a sphere rotating about a fixed axis\nunder the influence of random motion of the fluid. The\ndimensional momentum diffusion parameter is [18]\n\nD\u0303 = 16\u03c0kT Rh3 \u03b7\n\n(26)\n\nUsing Eq. (B4), the dimensionless momentum diffusion\nparameter D is\nD=\n\n8\u03c0kT Rh3 \u03b7T 3\nI32\n\n(27)\n\nHere T is the temperature, k is Boltzmann's constant, Rh\nis the radius of Hyperion, and \u03b7 is the kinetic viscosity of\nthe dust fluid, which, following [19], is calculated to be\n\n\u03b7=\n\nnmv\u0304L\n\u221a\n3 2\n\n(28)\n\nHere v\u0304 is the rms velocity of the dust particles, m is their\nmass, n is their number density, and L = 1/n\u03c0r2 is their\nmean-free-path, and r is the radius of a dust particle.\nThe properties of interplanetary dust were measured\nby the Voyager space probes. The average number density of particles near Saturn is n = 4 \u00d7 10\u22128 m\u22123 [20].\nThe average mass of the dust grains is estimated to be\nm = 10\u221210 g, and their radius is about r = 10\u22126 m. The\ntemperature in the vicinity of Saturn is about T \u2248 135\nK [10].\nUsing Eq. (28), treating Hyperion as a sphere of radius Rh = 150 km, and using \u03b7 = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 Pa s for the\nkinetic viscosity, we estimate the dimensionless angular\nmomentum diffusion parameter to be D \u2248 6.4 \u00d7 10\u221250 .\nEven such a small value is sufficient to reduce |qm \u2212 cl|1\nsubstantially. Using Eq. (23), the order of magnitude of\n|qm\u2212cl|1 for Hyperion is found to be 10\u221210 . This implies\nthat the classical and quantum probability distributions\nwill agree almost exactly for a large body such as Hyperion. Without the influence of the environment, the value\nof |qm\u2212cl|1 due to the very fine-scale differences between\nthe quantum and classical probability distributions might\nbe of order unity. But, of course, these differences would\nbe impossible to resolve because they exist on such a very\nfine scale. So the effect of decoherence is to destroy a fine\nstructure that would be unobservable anyhow.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper the regular and chaotic dynamics of\na satellite rotating under the influence of tidal forces\nwas examined, with application to the motion of Hyperion. Quantum and classical mechanics were compared\nfor both types of initial state, and the scaling with ~ of\nthe quantum-classical (QC) differences was determined.\nThe effect of the environment was modeled, and its effect on the QC differences was estimated, so as to determine whether environmental decoherence is needed to\naccount for the classical behavior of a macroscopic object like Hyperion. Two measures of the differences between quantum and classical mechanics were examined:\nthe QC difference in the average angular momentum,\n|hJz iQ \u2212 hJz iC |, and the differences between the probability distributions, |qm \u2212 cl|1 (Eq. (19)).\nFor early times, the QC differences in hJz i grow in\ntime as \u03c4 2 for the non-chaotic state, and as e2.9\u03c4 for the\nchaotic state. At longer times, the QC differences saturate for the chaotic state, but oscillate quasi-periodically\nfor the non-chaotic state. The magnitude of the QC differences scale as \u03b2 2 (dimensionless ~) at early times, for\nboth the chaotic and non-chaotic states. This \u03b2 2 scaling\npersists for all times for the non-chaotic state. But the\nQC differences that occurs in the saturation regime of\nthe chaotic state scale as \u03b2 2/3 . A similar scaling has also\nbeen observed for a model of two coupled rotors [8], so\nthis result is not peculiar to the particular model studied\nin this paper.\nThe value of the dimensionless ~ for Hyperion is \u03b2 =\n9.3 \u00d7 10\u221254 , for which the \u03b2 2/3 scaling relation predicts\na maximum value for the QC difference in hJz i to be\n5 \u00d7 10\u221237 . Therefore, there is no need to invoke environmental decoherence to explain the classical behavior of\nhJz i for a macroscopic object like Hyperion.\nAlthough the differences between the quantum and\nclassical averages of observables becomes very small in\nthe macroscopic limit, this need not be true for the differences between quantum and classical probability distributions. Indeed, the quantum probability distributions\ndo not converge pointwise to the classical probability\ndistributions, for either the non-chaotic or the chaotic\nstates. A modest amount of smoothing of the quantum\ndistribution reveals that it is made up of an extremely\nfine-scale oscillation superimposed upon a smooth background, and its is that smooth background that converges to the classical distribution. Similar behavior has\nbeen found for other one-dimensional systems [13]. This\nsmoothing can be regarded as an inevitable consequence\nof the finite resolving power of the measuring apparatus.\nAlternatively, it may be impossible to observe the fine\nstructure because of environmental decoherence. At the\nmacroscopic scale of Hyperion, the primary effect of decoherence is to destroy a fine structure that is anyhow\nmuch finer than could ever be resolved by measurement.\nWhen the environment was included, the results were\nfound to follow a scaling relationship proposed by [17]:\n\n\f15\nthe maximum distance between the classical and the\nquantum probability distributions is proportional to\n(\u03b2 2 /D)1/6 . Here D is the momentum diffusion parameter (see Appendix B). This suggests that the quantum\nprobability distributions will approach the classical distributions pointwise as \u03b2 \u2192 0, provided that D is nonzero. With environmental perturbations included, the\nQC differences in the probability distributions scaled as\n|qm \u2212 cl|1 \u221d \u03b2 1/3 . A similar scaling was also found for\ntwo autonomous coupled rotors [8]. This suggests that\npointwise convergence of the quantum probability distribution to the classical value may be typical for systems\nwith more than one degree of freedom, and the lack of\nsuch convergence for systems with only one degree of freedom may be pathological. The role of the environment,\nin the model of this paper, is then to cure this pathology\nby supplying more degrees of freedom.\nTaking D to be the momentum diffusion parameter\nfor rotation of Hyperion due to collisions with the interplanetary dust around Saturn, we find (estimated from\nEq. (23)) that the maximum of |qm \u2212 cl|1 that Hyperion\nshould exhibit should be of order 10\u221210 . Thus decoherence would cause the quantum probability distribution\nto converge to the classical distribution in essentially a\npointwise fashion.\nCoarse graining (due to the finite resolution power of\nthe measurement apparatus) will also decrease the QC\ndifferences in the probability distributions. In the saturation regime, the measure |qm \u2212 cl|1 of that difference\nwas found to be proportional to (\u03b2/\u2206s )0.44 , where \u2206s is\nthe width of the smoothing filter. This shows that decoherence and smoothing have similar effects. But they\nare not exactly equivalent, since their effects scale with\nsomewhat different values of \u03b2.\nIn conclusion, we find that, for all practical purposes,\nthe quantum theory of the chaotic tumbling motion of\nHyperion will agree with the classical theory, even without taking account of the effect of the environment. Decoherence aids in reducing the quantum-classical differences, but it is not correct to assert that environmental\ndecoherence is the root cause of the appearance of the\nclassical world.\n\nAPPENDIX A: CORRELATED RANDOM\nNUMBER GENERATION\n\nTo describe the effect of environmental perturbations,\nwe require a sequence of correlated random numbers.\nGenerators for uncorrelated random variates are commonly available, but algorithms for generating a correlated sequence are not common. We show here how to\ngenerate a random sequence having a controlled amount\nof correlation from a standard sequence of independently\ndistributed random numbers. Let {ri } be such a se-\n\nquence, with zero mean and unit variance.\nhri i = 0\nhri rj i = \u03b4ij\n\n(A1)\n(A2)\n\nTo generate a correlated sequence {Ri } from the uncorrelated sequence, we simply form linear combinations,\nRi+1 = cRi + (1 \u2212 c)ri+1\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere c is a chosen positive constant (c < 1), and R1 \u2261\nr1 .

Taking i > j, and using Eq.\n(A4) and Eq. (A2), we obtain\n\nhRi Rj i =\n\nj\u22122\ni\u22122 X\nX\n\nm=0 m\u2032 =0\n\n\u2032\n\ncm+m (1 \u2212 c)2 hri+1\u2212m rj+1\u2212m\u2032 i +\ni\u22122\nX\n\nm=0\nj\u22122\nX\n\nm\u2032 =0\n\ncm (1 \u2212 c)cj\u22121 hr1 ri+1\u2212m i +\n\n\u2032\n\ncm (1 \u2212 c)ci\u22121 hrj+1\u2212m\u2032 r1 i + ci\u2212j\u22122 hr12 i\n(A5)\n\nEq. (A5) can be simplified using Eq. (A2). Performing\nthe resulting geometric sums then yields\n\nhRi Rj i =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\u2212c\n1+c\n\n\u0013\n\nci\u22121 (c1\u2212j \u2212 cj\u22121 )\n\n(A6)\n\nFor j \u226b 1 and c < 1, Eq.

Each Ri refers to the correlated random\nfunction at time ti . Taking the time interval between the\nrandom numbers to be \u2206t, then it is appropriate to define a correlation time \u03c4c = \u2206t/| ln(c)| for the correlated\nrandom function, for which we have\n\nhR(0)R(\u03c4 )i \u2248\n\n\u0012\n\n1\u2212c\n1+c\n\n\u0013\n\ne\u2212\u03c4 /\u03c4c\n\n(A8)\n\n\f16\nAPPENDIX B: MOMENTUM DIFFUSION\nPARAMETER\n\nThe momentum diffusion parameter (D) is needed to\ncalculate the effect of the environment on the system [15,\n16, 21]. In particular, the form of D is needed to show\nthat the scaling result in [17] applies also to our model.\nConsider the random potential of the form V =\nV0 cos(\u03c6). The random torque is then F = V0 R(t) sin(\u03c6).\nHere R(t) is a correlated random function, as defined in\nAppendix A. From this, we can find the momentum diffusion parameter through the relation\n\nbecome a function of the single parameter \u03be, where\n\u03be = ~a \u03bbb Dc , for some powers a, b and c. Here D is\nthe diffusion parameter, defined in Appendix B, and \u03bb is\nthe classical Lyapunov exponent.\nThe argument is similar to one presented in [2]. It assumes that the differences between quantum and classical\nmechanics are due to the Moyal terms in the equation of\nmotion for the Wigner function.

Since these\nterms depend on \u2202p2n+1 \u03c1w , they will become larger as\ntime progresses and the fine structure grows. However\nthe inclusion of environmental perturbations on system\ncauses diffusion, which will limit the growth of the fine\nstructure. When these effects balance each other, the fine\nstructure is expected to have an equilibrium scale [2, 17]\ngiven by\n\u2202\u03c1w\n\u2248\n\u2202p\n\n\u03bb\n2D\n\n\u03be = ~2 \u03bb5/2 D\u2212(3/2)\n\n(C2)\n\n\u2202 3 V (\u03c6)\n\u2202\u03c63\n\n(C3)\n\nIt is argued [2] p\nthat the characteristic scale on which\n\u03c1w varies is \u03b4\u03c6 \u221d D/\u03bb. The characteristic variation of\n\u2202\u03c63 V (\u03c6) can be found by a Taylor expansion of \u2202\u03c63 V (\u03c6) \u221d\nsin(\u03c6) about an arbitrary point \u03c60 = 0. Averaging the\nresult over \u03c60 = 0 then yields\n\u2202 3 V (\u03c6)\n\u221d \u03b4\u03c6 \u2248\n\u2202\u03c63\n\nr\n\nD\n\u03bb\n\n(C4)\n\nInserting Eq. (C4) into Eq. (C3) yields\n\n\u03be\u221d\n\nPattanayak et al. [17] suggested that at long times\nthe QC differences in the probability distribution should\n\nr\n\nIf this equilibrium momentum scale is sufficiently large\ncompared to ~, then only the first order Moyal term\nshould be significant. Under this assumption, the QC\ndifferences should be a function of this Moyal term, given\nby\n\nwhere \u03c4c is defined to be \u03c4c = tc /T , and \u03c3 = V0 T 2 /I3 .\nAPPENDIX C: DERIVATION OF SCALING\nPARAMETER\n\n(C1)\n\n~2\nD\n\n(C5)\n\nThus, once the growth fine scale structure of the probability distribution reaches equilibrium with diffusion, the\nQC differences in the probability distribution should be\na function of ~2 D\u22121 . The results in Sec. V confirm this\nconclusion.\n\n\f17\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nby the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.\n\nWe would like to thank J. Emerson and B. C.
