Comparisons with X\u2013ray data revealed an enhanced X\u2013ray emission spatially coincident with the radio source, thus providing strong observational evidence for a connection between the hot,\nX\u2013ray gas and the radio plasma. In addition, the X\u2013ray\nmap of the cooling flow region shows an elongation coincident with the diffuse radio component (Rizza et al.\n2000).\nWe studied in detail the radio properties of A2626 in\norder to better investigate the nature of the interaction\nbetween the ICM and the radio plasma and in particular\nthe origin of the diffuse radio emission in the core of\ncooling flow clusters.\n\nWe present VLA data at 330 MHz and 1.5 GHz of\nthe radio emission observed in the cooling flow cluster A2626.

Standard data reduction was done using the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory (NRAO) AIPS package.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe cluster A2626 (z=0.0604) is a good candidate to\nstudy the interaction between the X\u2013ray emitting intra\u2013\ncluster medium (ICM) and radio emitting plasma in\nclusters of galaxies. This cluster hosts a relatively\nstrong cooling flow (White, Jones & Forman 1997) and\ncontains a very unusual radio source exhibiting a compact unresolved core and a diffuse structure (Roland\net al. 1985; Burns 1990).

The 1.5 GHz map (Fig. 1) shows an unresolved\ncore and a diffuse boxy\u2013shaped emission extended for\n\u223c 2\u2032 , corresponding to about 190 kpc. No significant\npolarized flux is detected, leading to a polarization upper limit of < 2 %. An unrelated source (associated\nwith the S0 galaxy IC5337 at the same redshift of the\ncluster) is present to the west of the diffuse emission,\nwith a total flux density of \u223c3.9 mJy.\nBy using the 1.5 GHz B array data we produced the\nhigh resolution image (Fig. 2) with a restoring beam\nof 4.5 \u00d7 3.9 arcsec. The central component is found\nto consist of an unresolved core, plus a jet-like feature pointing to the south-western direction. The extended emission is resolved out and two elongated parallel features of similar brightness and extent are detected. The flux density of the central component, the\n\nshort jet included, is \u2243 13.5 mJy, in agreement with\nRoland et al. (1985).\nIn order to estimate the total integrated flux density\nof the diffuse radio emission at 1.5 GHz and derive\nthe surface brightness map and spectral trend, we subtracted the emission from the central nuclear source.\nThis subtraction allows us to derive a good estimate of\nthe total flux density of the diffuse emission (S1.5 \u223c 29\nmJy).\nAs discussed in Gitti et al. (2004), we believe that the\nelongated structures visible in Fig. 2 are distinct (or\nthat they may represent an earlier evolutionary stage)\nfrom the diffuse emission, and that the diffuse radio\nsource may belong to the mini\u2013halo class. The total\nflux density of these structures is \u223c 6.6 mJy, thus contributing to only \u223c 20 % of the flux of the diffuse radio emission. Since we are interested in studying and\nmodeling the diffuse radio emission, we produced a\nnew low\u2013resolution map at 1.5 GHz where these discrete radio features have been subtracted (Fig. 3). To\nbe conservative, the region in which the surface brightness is affected by the central emission (within the circle in Fig. 3) has been excluded in modeling the diffuse\nradio emission (see Sect. 3).\n2.2 Radio map at \u03bd = 330 MHz\nWe used the 330 MHz B+DnC array data to produce\nlow resolution images with a circular restoring beam\nof 17 arcsec.

The cross indicates the position of the cluster\ncenter.\n\nThe diffuse structure at 330 MHz (Fig. 4) consists of\ntwo elongated almost parallel features located to the\nnorth and south of the core, respectively. No radio\nemission is detected at the location of the 1.5 GHz radio nucleus. Assuming for the 330 MHz core flux an\nupper limit of 3\u03c3, we obtain that the radio core has\nan inverted spectrum (Table 1). The total flux density\nof the diffuse emission is S330 \u223c 1 Jy. The unrelated\nsource, detected at 1.5 GHz to the west of the diffuse\nradio emission, is not detected at 330 MHz; this im<\nplies a spectrum with \u03b11.5\n0.3 \u223c0.6.\n2.3\n\n23 36 34\n\n32\n30\n28\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\n26\n\nFigure 5: Spectral index distribution between \u03bd = 330\nMHz and \u03bd = 1.5 GHz at a resolution of 17\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 17\u2032\u2032 .

Therefore, in deriving the spectral\ninformation of the diffuse emission we considered for\nconsistency the low\u2013resolution images in Fig. 1 and 4,\nwhich both include the contribution of the two features\nto the total flux. The integrated spectral index of the\ndiffuse emission between \u03bd = 330 MHz and \u03bd = 1.5\nGHz is \u03b1 \u223c 2.4.\nIn Fig. 5 we show a grey scale image of the spectral index map of the diffuse radio emission between\n\u03bd = 330 MHz and \u03bd = 1.5 GHz. The spectrum steepens from the central region towards the north and south\ndirection, with the spectral index increasing from \u223c1.2\nto \u223c3.\n\n2.4 Summary\n\nThe radio results are summarized in Table 1.\nThe extended radio source observed at the center of\nA2626 is characterized by amorphous morphology,\nlack of polarized flux and a very steep spectrum that\nsteepens with distance from the center. Finally, the size\nof the diffuse radio emission is comparable to that of\nthe cooling flow region (Rizza et al. 2000). These results indicate that the diffuse radio source may be classified as a mini\u2013halo.\n\n\f4 X-Ray and Radio Connections\n\nhttp://www.aoc.nrao.edu/events/xraydio\n\nSanta Fe NM, 3-6 February 2004\n\nTable 2: Model results for A2626\nMagnetic field\nElectron\nPreacc /PCF\nat the cooling radius\nenergetics\n1.2-1.6 \u03bcG\n\n2.2 \u00d7 1057 erg\n\n0.7 %\n\nmeaningful values of the parameters (Table 2). The application of the model to A2626 is discussed in detail\nin Gitti et al. (2004).\nFigure 6: General picture of the model\n\n3\n3.1\n\nModel for electron re\u2013acceleration in cooling flows: origin of radio mini\u2013halos\nOverview of the model\n\nGitti, Brunetti & Setti (2002) developed a model for\nradio mini\u2013halos consisting in the re\u2013acceleration of\nrelic relativistic electrons by MHD turbulence via\nFermi\u2013like processes, with the necessary energetics\nsupplied by the cooling flow.\nThe MHD turbulence is assumed to be frozen into the\nflow of the thermal ICM and is thus amplified due\nto the compression of the turbulent coherence length\nscale and the amplification of the magnetic field in the\ncooling flow region. However, the seed large\u2013scale\nturbulence (before the amplification) must not be too\nhigh in order to avoid the disruption of the cooling\nflow. There is thus a fine\u2013tuning of the turbulent energy to produce diffuse radio emission from a cooling\nflow cluster: in the picture of the model the physical\nconditions of mini\u2013halo clusters are intermediate between those which lead to the formation of extended\nradio halos, hosted by non\u2013cooling flow clusters, and\nthose holding in cooling flow clusters without radio halos (see Fig. 6).\n3.2\n\nModel application to A2626\n\nIn order to test the predictions of the model we have\ncalculated the following expected observable properties: total spectrum, brightness profile, and steepening of the spectrum with the distance from the center. The expected brightness profile and radial spectral steepening in the model were compared to the observed profiles along the radial direction indicated in\nFig. 5. We found that the model is able to reproduce all\nthe observational constraints of A2626 for physically\u2013\n\n3.3 Conclusions\nThe main radio properties of the mini\u2013halo observed in\nA2626 can be accounted for by the model. We found\nthat only a small fraction of the cooling flow power\nshould be converted into electron re\u2013acceleration.\nTherefore we conclude the cooling flow process is able\nto provide sufficient energy to power the radio mini\u2013\nhalo in A2626.\n\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge my collaborators G.\nBrunetti, L.
