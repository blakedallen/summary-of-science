Helmut Hofer introduced in '93 a novel technique based on holomorphic curves to\nprove the Weinstein conjecture. Among the cases where these methods apply are all contact\n3\u2013manifolds (M, \u03be) with \u03c02 (M ) 6= 0.

In particular, we are able\nto show that the connected sum with a real projective space always has a closed contractible\nReeb orbit.\n\n0. Introduction\nLet (M, \u03be) be a contact manifold with contact form \u03b1. The associated Reeb field R\u03b1 is the\nunique vector field that satisfies the equations\n\u03b1(R\u03b1 ) = 1\n\nand\n\n\u03b9R\u03b1 d\u03b1 = 0\n\neverywhere.\nWeinstein conjecture. Let (M, \u03be) be a closed contact manifold, and choose any contact form \u03b1\nwith \u03be = ker \u03b1. The Reeb field R\u03b1 associated to \u03b1 always has a closed orbit.\nIn his seminal paper [Hof93], Helmut Hofer found a strong relation between the dynamics of\nthe Reeb field and holomorphic curves in symplectizations. Initially Hofer proved the Weinstein\nconjecture using these methods in three cases, namely the conjecture holds for a closed contact\n3\u2013manifold (M, \u03be), if M is diffeomorphic to S3 , if \u03be is overtwisted or if \u03c02 (M ) 6= 0.\nA generalization of the second case to higher dimensions has been achieved in [AH09] for contact\nstructures that have a Plastikstufe. We will try to generalize the third one. In order to justify our\nhypothesis, let us recall the key steps in Hofer's proof. The non-triviality of the second homotopy\ngroup combined with the assumption that the contact structure is tight, allow us to find a noncontractible embedded sphere whose characteristic foliation has only two elliptic singularities and\nno closed leaves. Near the singularities, an explicit Bishop family of holomorphic disks can be\nconstructed, and it can be proved that the disks produce a finite energy plane. The existence of\na finite energy plane in a symplectization of the manifold implies the existence of a contractible\nperiodic Reeb orbit.\nOur generalization of Hofer's theorem for contact (2n + 1)\u2013manifolds replaces the 2\u2013sphere\nby an embedded (n + 1)\u2013submanifold such that the contact structure restricts to an open book\ndecomposition. Following Hofer's ideas, we will prove that if such a submanifold represents a\nnon-trivial homology class then there exists a periodic contractible Reeb orbit.\nAmong the examples where we are able to find such submanifolds, are the connected sum of\nany contact manifold M with\n(a) the projetive space with its standard contact structure\n(b) certain subcritically fillable manifolds as for example Sn \u00d7 Sn+1 or Tn \u00d7 Sn+1 .\nAcknowledgments.

NIEDERKR\u00dcGER AND A. RECHTMAN\n\n1. The main criteria\nDefinition. An open book decomposition (\u03b8, B) of a manifold N consists of\n(i) a proper codimension 2 submanifold B \u2282 N that has a tubular neighborhood that is\ndiffeomorphic to B \u00d7 C, and\n(ii) a proper fibration \u03b8 : (N \\ B) \u2192 S1 such that the map \u03b8 agrees on the neighborhood B \u00d7 C\nwith the angular coordinate ei\u03c6 of the C\u2013factor.\nThe submanifold B is called the binding, and the fibers of \u03b8 are called the pages of the open\nbook. From the definition it follows that the closure of a page P in N is a compact manifold with\nboundary B.\nRemark 1. Open book decompositions are typically only studied on closed manifolds, in which\ncase the binding is also a closed manifold. In this article, we will first restrict to closed manifolds,\nbut then we will study closed manifolds whose universal cover admits an open book decomposition,\nand we do not want to suppose that the universal cover itself is a closed manifold.\nAssume (M, \u03be) is a contact (2n + 1)\u2013manifold. A submanifold N ,\u2192 M is called maximally\nfoliated by \u03be if dim N = n + 1, and if the intersection \u03be \u2229 T N defines a singular foliation on N .\nThe regular leaves of such a foliation are locally Legendrian submanifolds.\nDefinition. In the situation above, we say that N ,\u2192 (M, \u03be) carries a Legendrian open book,\nif\n\b the maximal foliation on N defines an open book decomposition of N , i.e., the singular set\np \u2208 N Tp N \u2282 \u03bep is the binding of an open book on N , and each regular leaf of the foliation\ncorresponds to a page of the open book.\nThe following notion is extensively studied in [MNW] as a filling obstruction, here we will only\nuse it as a sufficient condition for the existence of a closed contractible Reeb orbit.\nDefinition. Let N be a compact submanifold of (M, \u03be) that is maximally foliated by \u03be, and has\nnon-empty boundary \u2202N that can be written as a product manifold \u2202N \u223c\n= S1 \u00d7 L. We say that\nN carries a Legendrian open book with boundary, if the following conditions are satisfied\nby the foliation:\n(i) The singular set is the union of the boundary \u2202N and a closed (not necessarily connected)\ncodimension 2 submanifold B \u2282 N \\ \u2202N with trivial normal bundle.\n(ii) There exists a submersion\n\u03b8 : N \\ B \u2192 S1\nthat restricts on \u2202N \u223c\n= S1 \u00d7 L to the projection onto the first factor.\n(iii) The regular leaves of the Legendrian foliation \u03be \u2229 T N are the fibers of \u03b8 intersected with\nthe interior of N .\n(iv) The neighborhood of B has a trivialization B \u00d7 C for which the angular coordinate ei\u03c6 on\nC agrees with the map \u03b8.\nRemark 2. There are two common definitions of the overtwisted disk; according to one version\nthe boundary is a regular compact leaf of the foliation, but there is a second version where the\nfoliation is singular along the boundary of the disk. This second definition is an example of a\nLegendrian open book with boundary. By a small perturbation it is always possible to move from\none version to the other one, so that both definitions are equivalent. Similarly, it is possible to\ndeform a plastikstufe to obtain a Legendrian open book with boundary, so that the definition\nabove includes P S\u2013overtwisted manifolds.\nTheorem 1. Let (M, \u03be) be a closed contact manifold, and let N be a compact submanifold.\n(i) If \u03be induces a Legendrian open book on N (without boundary), and if \u03be admits a contact\nform \u03b1 without closed contractible Reeb orbits, then it follows that N represents the trivial\nhomology class in Hn+1 (M, Z2 ).\n(ii) If \u03be induces a Legendrian open book with boundary on N , then every contact form \u03b1 on\n(M, \u03be) has a closed contractible Reeb orbit.\n\n\fWEINSTEIN CONJECTURE IN HIGHER DIMENSIONS\n\n3\n\nRemark 3. In the situation of Theorem 1.(ii), it also follows that (M, \u03be) does not admit a (semipositive) strong symplectic filling in general, and under some cohomological condition it even\nexcludes the existence of a weak filling. The proof of this fact is given in [MNW]. We will call\nsuch a contact structure P S\u2013overtwisted.\nRemark 4. It should be possible to strengthen the conclusions of the theorem. For example, if both\nN and the moduli space used in the proof of (i) are orientable, the coefficients for the homology\ngroup can be taken in Z.\nProof of Theorem 1. Following Hofer's idea for 3\u2013manifolds, we will study a moduli space of holomorphic disks in the symplectization of (M, \u03b1). To prove (i), we will then show that the union of\nthese holomorphic disks represents a chain in M whose boundary is homologous to the submanifold N . The proof of (ii) is based on a contradiction to Gromov compactness as in [AH09], and\nwe will only discuss it briefly at the end.\n(i) First, we have to choose a suitable almost complex structure J on the symplectization\n\u0001\nR \u00d7 M, d(et \u03b1) .\nWe embed (M, \u03b1) as the 0\u2013level set {0} \u00d7 M , and define J first in a neighborhood of the binding B\nin {0} \u00d7 N , before extending it over all of R \u00d7 M . It was shown in [Nie06, Section 3] that the germ\nof the contact form in a neighborhood of B is completely determined by the foliation on N , or\nsaid otherwise, there is a neighborhood U around the binding B that is strictly contactomorphic\ne of the 0\u2013section in\nto a neighborhood U\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\nR3 \u00d7 T \u2217 B, dz + (x dy \u2212 y dx) + \u03bbcan ,\n2\nwhere (x, y, z) are the standard coordinates on R3 , and \u03bbcan is the canonical 1\u2013form on T \u2217 B. The\ne with the submanifold {(x, y, 0)} \u00d7 B.\nset U \u2229 N corresponds in this model to the intersection of U\nWe will now study the following model for the symplectization of U : Let W1 = C2 be the\nStein manifold with standard complex, and symplectic structures, and with the plurisubharmonic\n2\n2\nfunction h1 (z1 , z2 ) = |z1 | + |z2 | . To find a Weinstein structure on T \u2217 B choose a Riemannian\nmetric g on the binding B, then the cotangent bundle W2 = T \u2217 B carries an induced Riemannian\nmetric ge, and an exact symplectic structure d\u03bbcan given by the differential of the canonical 1\u2013form\n\u03bbcan := \u2212p dq. There is a unique almost complex structure Jg on W2 that is compatible with\n2\nd\u03bbcan and with the metric ge. The function h2 (q, p) = kpk /2 is Jg \u2013plurisubharmonic and satisfies\ndh2 \u25e6 Jg = \u2212\u03bbcan (see also [Nie06, Appendix B]).\nThe product manifold W = W1 \u00d7 W2 = C2 \u00d7 T \u2217 B is a Weinstein manifold with almost complex\nstructure J 0 = i \u2295 Jg , and plurisubharmonic function h = h1 + h2 . Its contact type boundary\nM 0 := h\u22121 (1) contains the submanifold\nn q\no\n\u0001\n2\n1 \u2212 |z| , z; q, 0\n|z| < \u03b5 \u223c\n= D2 \u00d7 B .\nThe natural contact structure ker(dh \u25e6 J 0 ) on M 0 induces a singular foliation on this submanifold\nthat is diffeomorphic to the neighborhood of the binding of an open book, so that in fact the\nneighborhood of this submanifold in W is symplectomorphic to a neighborhood of {0} \u00d7 B in the\nsymplectization, and the plurisubharmonic function h coincides with et on R \u00d7 M .\nThe pull-back of J 0 = i \u2295 Jg to the symplectization defines thus an almost complex structure\nin a neighborhood of the binding {0} \u00d7 B in R \u00d7 M , which we can easily extend to an almost\ncomplex structure on (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u00d7 M that is compatible with the symplectic form d(et \u03b1), and for\nwhich dt \u25e6 J = \u03b1. Unfortunately this almost complex structure is not t\u2013invariant, but we can\nextend J to an almost complex structure that is tamed by d(et \u03b1) everywhere, restricts to \u03be, and\nis t\u2013invariant below a certain level set {\u2212C} \u00d7 M in the symplectization.\nWith the chosen almost complex structure J, it is easy to explicitly write down a Bishop family\nof holomorphic disks in a neighborhood of {0} \u00d7 B, and to use an intersection argument to exclude\nthe existence of other holomorphic disks in this neighborhood. Namely, the Bishop family will be\ngiven in the model C2 \u00d7 T \u2217 B by the intersection of the 2\u2013planes\n\b\nEt0 ,q0 := (t0 , z; q0 , 0) q0 \u2208 B, t0 < 1, z \u2208 C\n\n\f4\n\nK.

The result gives for every point q0 of the binding B a 1\u2013dimensional family\nof round disks attached with their boundary to the foliated submanifold. The radius of the disk\ndecreases as t0 \u2192 1, and in the limit the disks collapse to the point q0 \u2208 B. All of the disks\nare pairwise disjoint, and if we look at the space of parameterized disks, we obtain thus a smooth\n(n + 3)\u2013dimensional manifold.\nTo exclude the existence of other disks close to the binding, we use an intersection argument\nwith the local foliation given by (i \u2295 Jg )\u2013holomorphic codimension 2 submanifolds\n\b\nSz0 := (z0 , z) z \u2208 C \u00d7 T \u2217 B\nwith Re z0 < 1.

Symplectizations never contain holomorphic spheres, and since by our assumption (M, \u03b1) does not have closed contractible Reeb orbits, we also have excluded the existence of\nf cross every\nfinite energy planes. Finally, bubbling of disks is not allowed because the maps in M\npage of the open book on N exactly once, and this implies that the boundary of the disks are\nundecomposable.\n\u0003\n\n\fWEINSTEIN CONJECTURE IN HIGHER DIMENSIONS\n\n5\n\nf understood, we will now study the moduli space\nWith the limit behavior of the maps in M\nf \u00d7 D2 / \u223c ,\nM := M\nf \u00d7 D2 , if and only if there is a M\u00f6bius transformation\nwhere we identify pairs (u, z), (u0 , z 0 ) \u2208 M\n\u0001\n2\n0\n\u22121\nf is proper\n\u03c6 \u2208 Aut(D ) such that (u, z) = u \u25e6 \u03c6 , \u03c6(z 0 ) .

The degree deg f \u2208 Z2 of a continuous map f : X \u2192 Y between two closed n\u2013\nmanifolds X and Y is defined as the element A \u2208 Z2 such that f# [X] = A [Y ] \u2208 Hn (Y, Z2 ).\nFor smooth maps it is easy to compute deg f , because it suffices to take a regular value y \u2208 Y\nof f , and count [Eps66]\ndeg f = #f \u22121 (y) mod 2 .\nHence, it follows immediately that the restriction of the evaluation map to the boundary \u2202M of\nthe moduli space is a smooth map\nev|\u2202M : \u2202M \u2192 {0} \u00d7 N\nof degree 1 (as can be easily seen by using that close to the binding {0} \u00d7 B there is for every\np \u2208 {0} \u00d7 N a unique disk [u, z] \u2208 \u2202M with u(z) = p).

We only consider the component M0 of ev\u22121 (\u03b3) that contains elements of the Bishop family.\nThe closure of the submanifold M0 has one end that corresponds to the disks that collapse to\na point on the binding, and so M0 cannot be a circle, but must be instead an interval.

The pages of this open book are still (n \u2212 2)\u2013balls, but the\nmonodromy is the antipodal map, and going around the binding once corresponds to crossing all\npages twice (see Fig. 2). This way we obtain a 2\u2013fold covered open book of RPn\u22121 that is not a\nproper open book decomposition.\n\nFigure 1. The standard open book on the 2\u2013sphere.\n\nFigure 2.

Let N be a closed submanifold of a contact manifold (M, \u03be), and assume that \u03be\ninduces a Legendrian k\u2013fold covered open book on N . We say that N is nucleation free, if every\nloop \u03b3 : S1 \u2192 N \\ B that projects via \u03b8 : N \\ B \u2192 S1 to a generator of \u03c01 (S1 ), represents in \u03c01 (M )\nan element that is at least of order k.\n\n\f8\n\nK. NIEDERKR\u00dcGER AND A. RECHTMAN\n\nRemark 5. The reason for our definition of nucleation free is that it excludes bubbling of certain\nholomorphic disks in the symplectization R\u00d7M . The boundary of every non-constant holomorphic\ndisk u that is attached with \u2202u to the submanifold {0} \u00d7 N will always have positive transverse\nintersections with the pages of the covered open book. Since \u2202u is also clearly contractible in M ,\nit follows that \u03b8(\u2202u) \u2282 S1 will make a (positive) multiple of k turns in the covered open book.\nIf we then choose a sequence of holomorphic disks (un )n such that each one intersects every\npage of the open book exactly k times, the limit curve of (un )n cannot decompose into several\nnon-constant holomorphic disks v1 , * * * , vN , because the boundary of these curves would describe\nloops in N \\ B that are contractible in M , but that make strictly less than k turns in the covered\nopen book.\nTheorem 2. Let (M, \u03be) be a closed contact manifold, and let N be a compact submanifold.\n(i) If \u03be admits a contact form \u03b1 without closed contractible Reeb orbits, and if it induces a\nLegendrian covered open book on N that is nucleation free, then N represents the trivial\nhomology class in Hn+1 (M, Z2 ).\n(ii) If \u03be induces on N a Legendrian covered open book with boundary that is nucleation free,\nthen every contact form \u03b1 of (M, \u03be) has a closed contractible Reeb orbit.\nRemark 6. Note that the conditions in Theorem 2.(ii) do not imply the non-fillability of M .\nNonetheless, it implies that there is a loop in N \\ B that projects via \u03b8 onto a positive generator\nof S1 , and represents in the filling W of M an element of \u03c01 (W ) of order strictly less than k.\nProof. We follow the lines of the proof of Theorem 1, but several details have to be adjusted to the\nnew situation. To find a Bishop family around the binding B, we will construct a model around\ne in the cover, perform all steps as in Theorem 1, and finally show that \u03c0 : N\ne \u2192N\nthe binding B\ninduces similar results in the base.\ne , and that\nNote that the fundamental group G := \u03c01 (N ) acts by deck transformations on N\n\u223c\ne\nN /G = N . We will identify a tubular neighborhood of N in M with a neighborhood U of the\n0\u2013section in the normal bundle \u03bdN . The universal cover of \u03bdN is just given by the pull-back\ne , and so we find a neighborhood U\ne of the 0\u2013section of \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03bdN ) such that\nbundle \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03bdN ) over N\ne /G = U .

But the construction\nto be a bit more careful though, because B\nof this contactomorphism is based on the Moser trick, and a closer inspection of the proof shows\nthat not only does this contactomorphism exist, but that it is even G\u2013equivariant: where G acts\ne\ne and on the R3 \u2013factor by linear\non the T \u2217 B\u2013factor\nby the linearization of the G\u2013action on B,\ntransformations leaving the z\u2013direction invariant.\ne is the universal cover of the symplectization R\u00d7U . The fundamental\nThe symplectization R\u00d7 U\ngroup G = \u03c01 (N ) acts trivially on the R\u2013factor, and thus respects the symplectic form d(et \u03b1\ne). It\nis also not difficult (though tiresome) to check that the almost complex structure J constructed\nin [Nie06, Section 3] is also G\u2013invariant.\ne a Bishop family of J\u2013holomorphic disks,\nAs in the Proof of Theorem 1, we find in R \u00d7 U\nand also the corresponding family of codimension 2 almost complex submanifolds Sz used for the\nintersection argument. Furthermore since J is G\u2013invariant, it follows that G maps each of these\nfamilies into itself, and so we may project the almost complex structure J, and these families into\nthe symplectization R \u00d7 M .\nThe boundary of the Bishop disks in R \u00d7 M intersect each page of the covered open book\nexactly k\u2013times, and we supposed that N is nucleation free so that bubbling is not possible. This\nway the rest of the proof is now exactly as the one of Theorem 1.\n\u0003\n\n\fWEINSTEIN CONJECTURE IN HIGHER DIMENSIONS\n\n9\n\n2. Examples and applications\nThe main difficulty consists in finding a situation where we can apply Theorems 1 and 2 to\nprove the Weinstein conjecture.\nNote that it is easy to find examples of submanifolds with an induced Legendrian open book\n\u0001 in\nany Darboux chart. For example, it is easy to see that Sn+1 can be embedded into S2n+1 , \u03be0 via\n\u0001\n(x0 , . . . , xn+1 ) \u2208 Sn+1 ,\u2192 x0 + ix1 , x2 , . . . , xn+1 \u2208 Cn+1\nsuch that the standard contact form restricts to x0 dx1 \u2212 x1 dx0 which clearly defines the canonical\nopen book on Sn+1 with an n\u2013ball as a page, and with trivial monodromy. Another example was\ngiven in [Nie06,\u0001 Section 5.2], where it was shown that we can embed S2 \u00d7 Sn\u22121 in the desired way\ninto R2n+1 , \u03be0 .\nOn the other hand there are often evident obstructions to the realization of a homology class by\na maximally foliated submanifold as an open book. For example, the only closed 2\u2013dimensional\nmanifolds that admit a proper or a covered open book decomposition are S2 and RP2 . The reason\nfor this is that if \u03a3 is a closed surface that admits a (covered) open book, then we can lift the\nrotational vector field \u2202\u03c6 from S1 to \u03a3, and obtain a vector field whose index is positive at each\nof its singularities. By the Poincar\u00e9-Hopf theorem it follows that the Euler characteristic of \u03a3 has\nto be positive, but the only compact surfaces that have positive Euler characteristic are S2 and\nRP2 . Hence for purely topological obstructions, we obtain that T3 (or for example a hyperbolic 3\u2013\nmanifold) does not contain any embedded non-nullhomologous 2\u2013sphere or real projective 2\u2013space,\nbecause both would have to lift to a non-nullhomologous S2 in R3 .\nBut it is also easy to give contact topological obstructions, because there are many contact\nmanifolds that do not have contractible Reeb orbits as the following examples will show.\nExample 3. Let (M, \u03be) be the unit cotangent bundle S(T \u2217 Tn ) of the torus with its canonical\ncontact structure. We can identify M with Tn \u00d7 Sn\u22121 with coordinates (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2208 Tn and\n(y1 , . . . , yn ) \u2208 Sn\u22121 and write the canonical 1\u2013form as\n\u03bbcan =\n\nn\nX\n\nyj dxj .\n\nj=1\n\nP\nThe Reeb field for this form is R = j yj \u2202xj , and so it follows that the orbits move in constant\ndirection along the torus, and hence there will not be any closed contractible Reeb orbits. In\nparticular it follows\u0001 that it is not possible to embed any manifold with a Legendrian\nopen book\n\u0001\ninto S(T \u2217 Tn ), \u03bbcan that represents a non-trivial class in Hn+1 S(T \u2217 Tn ), Z2 .\nAfter having described some of the problems of our method, we will give some positive examples.\nExample 4. Let (M, \u03be) be a contact manifold that is subcritically Stein fillable, that means it\ncan be filled by a Stein manifold of the form (C \u00d7 W, dx \u2227 dy + d\u03bb), where (W, d\u03bb) is a 2n\u2013\ndimensional Stein manifold. Then it follows that (M, \u03be) admits an open book with page W and\ntrivial monodromy consisting of taking the angular coordinate on the C\u2013factor of C \u00d7 W as a\nfibration over S1 .\nAny properly embedded Lagrangian submanifold L in W gives rise to an (n+1)\u2013submanifold N\nof M that is foliated as a Legendrian open book. In fact, N is obtained by taking the intersection\nof C \u00d7 L \u2282 C \u00d7 W with the convex boundary M . Another way to describe the construction is\nby saying that we take the product of L with S1 , and then close this off by adding \u2202L \u00d7 D2 in a\nneighborhood of the binding of M .\nUnfortunately this manifold will often be homologically trivial. We can avoid this problem if\nW is a Stein manifold with plurisubharmonic Morse function h : W \u2192 [0, \u221e), and if the highest\ncritical point p0 is of index n, because then we can take for L the unstable manifold of p0 which\nwill be a Lagrangian plane which intersects the skeleton of W only in p0 . This way, we obtain for\nN a sphere with the standard Legendrian open book decomposition, and the intersection between\nN and the skeleton of any page is 1, so that [N ] may not be trivial in Hn+1 (M, Z2 ), and we can\napply our theorem to find a contractible Reeb orbit.\n\n\f10\n\nK. NIEDERKR\u00dcGER AND A. RECHTMAN\n\nThe easiest examples that fit into this situation are unit bundles of C \u2295 T \u2217 S for any closed\nmanifold S. To be even more explicit, take the contact structure \u03be on Tn \u00d7 Sn+1 given by\nn\n\u0010X\n\u0001\u0011\n1\n\u03be = ker\nyj dxj +\nyn+1 dyn+2 \u2212 yn+2 dyn+1\n2\nj=1\n\nwith (x1 , . . . , xn ) the coordinates on Tn , and (y1 , . . . , yn+2 ) the coordinates on Sn+1 . Here, any\nsphere {x} \u00d7 Sn+1 is foliated by a Legendrian open book, and we obtain, in contrast to Example 3,\nthat (Tn \u00d7 Sn+1 , \u03be) always has a closed contractible Reeb orbit.\nSimilarly the contact structure on Sn \u00d7 Sn+1 given by using the trivial open book with page\n\u2217 n\nT S and trivial monodromy also always has a closed contractible Reeb orbits.\nExample 5. The most obvious example, where we find a submanifold with a Legendrian covered\nopen book is the real projective space with the standard contact structure\n\u0010\n\n\b\nRP2n\u22121 = [x1 : * * * : xn : y1 : * * * : yn ]\n\nX\n\n(x2j + yj2 ) = 1 ,\n\nj\n\n\u03be0 := ker\n\nn\nX\n\nxj dyj \u2212 yj dxj\n\n\u0001\u0011\n\nj=1\n\ngiven\nas the quotient of the standard contact sphere S2n\u22121 by the antipodal map. The submanifold\n\b\n[x1 : * * * : xn : xn+1 : 0 : * * * : 0] \u223c\n= RPn+1 represents the non-trivial class in Hn (RP2n\u22121 , Z2 ),\nand carries the covered open book described in Example 2. It follows from Theorem 2 that any\ncontact form for \u03be0 admits a contractible closed Reeb orbit.\nNote that the Weinstein conjecture for Example 5 is well known, because it has already been\nproved a long time ago for the standard contact structure on the unit sphere [Rab78]. Similarly\nthe Weinstein conjecture for subcritically fillable manifolds can be proved in general (that means\nwithout imposing the condition on the critical points) by using the technically much more difficult\nresults from SFT [Yau04].\nStill, we believe that our results have some value in depending only on local information, for\nexample it is easy to prove:\nLemma 1. Let (M1 , \u03be1 ) and (M2 , \u03be2 ) be two closed cooriented contact manifolds with dim M1 =\ndim M2 . If (M1 , \u03be1 ) satisfies the conditions of Theorem 1 or 2, then any contact form on the\nconnected sum\n\u0001\nM1 #M2 , \u03be1 #\u03be2\nhas a contractible Reeb orbit.\nSimilar results can be obtained for other surgeries, but they require a more careful analysis in\neach situation.\nReferences\n[AH09] P.
