Especially, the system is known to possess a hidden\nsupersymmetry commuting with the original supersymmetry which squares to the Hamiltonian of the system. This\nfeature is present both in the case [3] of a charged particle in the background of the Dirac monopole and the case\n[4] of an isospin particle in the Wu-Yang monopole [6] background. In Ref. [3], it was shown that the hidden\nsupersymmetry can be identified with the usual supersymmetry of a charged particle if it is restricted on a sphere.\nThis led to the manifest extended supersymmetric formulation of charged particle on S 2 in the Dirac magnetic\nmonopole background. In Ref. [5] the complete energy spectra and the corresponding eigenfunctions were obtained\nand the issue of the invariance of the ground energy states under the supersymmetry transformation were discussed,\nand it was shown that spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry occurred for certain values of the monopole charge.\nFurthermore, it was shown that the system on S 2 admits N = 4 real supersymmetries in contrast to the N = 1 and\nN = 2 supersymmetries on R3 [2]. It turns out that the supersymmetry generators in that case form SU (2|1) [7]\nsuperalgebra rather than the standard supersymmetry algebra in which the superchages square to the Hamiltonian of\nthe system. In this context it would be interesting to add more fermionic degrees of freedom and check the consequent\nsuperalgebra.\nIn this paper, we study the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of an isospin particle on S 2 in the background of the\nWu-Yang monopole [6], a spherically symmetric solution to the sourceless SU (2) Yang-Mills equations. In particular,\nwe address the issue of whether the number of internal supersymmetries can be enlarged. The action principle for the\nsupersymmetric isospin particles was given in Refs. [8] and [4], which generalized bosonic Wong's equation [9]. This\naction has the properties that the system is invariant under the simultaneous rotations of isospace and ordinary space\nand under the N = 1 real supersymmetry transformation. We first formulate the supersymmetric isospin particle\nsystem in the CP (1) model approach [5]. It is shown that by introducing N complex fermion degrees of freedom with\na quartic fermion interaction term and considering the system on a sphere in the background of Wu-Yang monopole\ngauge, the number of complex supersymmetries N can be made arbitrary. With an appropriate choice of ordering the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nsoonhong@ewha.ac.kr\njoohan@kerr.uos.ac.kr\nthlee@ssu.ac.kr\nploh@newton.skku.ac.kr\n\n\f2\nquantized Hamiltonian can be made invariant under the supersymmetry transformations. However, the symmetry\nalgebra including the supercharges becomes nonlinear when the number of fermions is greater than two. We find that\nthe algebra becomes the usual supersymmetry algebra when N = 1. If N = 2, the symmetry algebra can be identified\nwith SU (2|1) superalgebra. For general N > 2 the algebra takes the nonlinear form. We then consider the energy\neigenvalue problem and obtain the energy spectra and the eigenstates. It turns out that the energy eigenfunctions are\ngiven by the product of monopole harmonics [10] and certain isospin states. (See Eq. (27) below.) By looking at the\nsupersymmetric structure of the ground state we find that the supersymmetry is spontaneously broken depending on\nthe number of N : it is unbroken when N is odd whereas half of the supersymmetries are broken for even N .\nIn order to proceed, let us consider an isospin particle in R3 in the background of the Wu-Yang monopole gauge\nfield [6],\nAai = \u2212\u01eba ij\n\nxj\n,\ngr2\n\nAa0 = 0,\n\nthe field strength of which is given by\nFija = \u2202i Aaj \u2212 \u2202j Aai \u2212 g\u01ebabc Abi Acj = \u01ebijk\n\nxa xk\n.\ngr4\n\nThe N = 1 supersymmetric Lagrangian [8], [4] can be written as\nL=\n\n1 2 i\n\u1e8b + \u03c8i \u03c8\u0307i + i\u03b8\u0304\u03b8\u0307 \u2212 g \u1e8bi Aai I a \u2212 gSi Bia I a ,\n2 i\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere I a = 21 \u03b8\u0304\u03c3 a \u03b8, and Si := \u2212 2i \u01ebijk \u03c8j \u03c8k denotes the spin. Its Hamiltonian is given by\n1 2\n1\n\u1e8b + gSi Bia I a = (pi \u2212 igAai I a )2 + gSi Bia I a ,\n2 i\n2\nand the total angular momentum becomes\nH=\n\nJi = \u01ebijk xj (\u1e8bk \u2212 gAak I a ) + Ii + Si\n= \u01ebijk xj \u1e8bk + (x\u0302k Ik )x\u0302i + Si ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere in the second line the explicit form of the gauge field was used. This system is known [3, 4] to possess a hidden\nsupersymmetry commuting with the original supersymmetry. In Ref. [3], it is also shown that when the particle is\nrestricted to the sphere of constant radius they together form N = 2 supersymmetries. Therefore, in terms of the\nlocal coordinates of S 2 one can write down a manifestly N = 2 supersymmetric Lagrangian. In this paper, however,\nwe will use CP (1) model type of approach expressing the Lagrangian in terms of the S 3 variable z = (z1 , z2 ) satisfying\nz\u0304 * z = 1 and the complex spinor \u03c8 = (\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) satisfying z\u0304 * \u03c8 = 0 and its conjugation relation, where we have used\nthe notation A * B = A1 B1 + A2 B2 . The dynamics on S 2 is recovered by imposing the local phase symmetry. The\nLagrangian can be written as\nL = 2|Dt z|2 + i\u03c8\u0304 * Dt \u03c8 + i\u03b8\u0304\u03b8\u0307 \u2212 i(z\u0304\u03c3i Dt z \u2212 Dt z\u0304\u03c3i z)Ii ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Dt defined by Dt z \u2261 \u017c \u2212 iaz with a given by\n\n1\ni\na = \u2212 (z\u0304 * \u017c \u2212 z\u0304 \u0307 * z) \u2212 \u03c8\u0304 * \u03c8\n2\n2\n\nis a covariant derivative with respect to the U (1) phase transformation. Consequently, the Lagrangian describes a\nparticle on unit S 2 although it is written in S 3 variables. One can show that, using the unit radial vector xi = z\u0304\u03c3i z\ndefining S 2 , the last term of Eq. (3) can be written as\n\u01ebkij \u1e8bi xj Ik + \u03c8\u0304 * \u03c8xi Ii ,\nwhich is the same as the interaction term of Eq. (1) evaluated on the unit S 2 in the background of the Wu-Yang\nmonopole, if \u2212(\u03c8\u0304 * \u03c8) is identified as the classical analogue of the radial component1 of the spin Si . With the\nidentification\n1\n\u03c8i = \u221a (z\u0304\u03c3i \u03c8 + \u03c8\u0304\u03c3i z),\n(4)\n2\n\n1\n\nFor its quantum mechanical definition, see Eq. (15). In fact, when restricted to S 2 , only the radial component of the spin survives.\n\n\f3\none can further show that the first two terms of the Eq.

Besides these commutation relations the following should be\nsatisfied:\nB * z = 0,\n\nz\u0304 * B\u0304 = 0,\n\nas operator identities. The Gauss law constraints can be written as\nCG \u2261 \u0168B \u2212 2\u03b2\u0304\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b1 + \u03b1G = 0,\n\n(10)\n\nwhich has to be imposed on the physical states. The constant \u03b1G is the ordering parameter that will be fixed. [See\nEq.

[5]. However, it can\nbe absorbed if the Gauss Law constraint is appropriately ordered. So, here we choose a particular ordering.\n\n\f5\nIn quantizing the Hamiltonian there arises ordering ambiguity. One can fix one particular ordering and determine the\nHamiltonian by adding the terms arising from changing the operator ordering using other requirement. In our case\nwe will impose the invariance under the supersymmetric transformations. Therefore, we will tentatively choose the\nfollowing form of the Hamiltonian:\n1\nH = 2\u2207t z\u0304 * \u2207t z + (\u03c8\u0304\u03b1 * \u03c8\u03b1 )2 \u2212 \u03c8\u0304\u03b1 * \u03c8\u03b1 Ir + C \u03c8\u0304\u03b1 * \u03c8\u03b1 + DIr ,\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere Ir \u2261 (z\u0304\u03c3i z)Ii denotes the radial component of the isospin and the constants C, D are ordering parameters to\nbe fixed later.\nThe quantum angular momentum operator satisfying the correct commutation relations turns out to be\ni\n1\nJi = \u2212 (p\u03c3i z \u2212 z\u0304\u03c3i p\u0304) \u2212 z\u0304\u03c3i z + \u03c8\u0304\u03b1 \u03c3i \u03c8\u03b1 + Ii\n2\n2\ni\n1\n= \u2212 (B\u03c3i z \u2212 z\u0304\u03c3i B\u0304 \u2212 2iz\u0304\u03c3i z) \u2212 \u0168B z\u0304\u03c3i z + Ii\n2\n2\n1\n= \u01ebijk z\u0304\u03c3j z(\u2207t z\u0304\u03c3k z + z\u0304\u03c3k \u2207t z) \u2212 \u0168B z\u0304\u03c3i z + (z\u0304\u03c3k zIk )z\u0304\u03c3i z.\n2\n\n(12)\n\nThe first expression is the same as the Noether charge except the ordering term which is necessary to produce the\ncorrect angular momentum commutation relations, and the third expression shows the decomposition of the angular\nmomentum into the orbital part and the the rest. Comparing the final expression with Eq. (2) suggests identifying the\nsecond term as the spin. Indeed, using Eq. (4) one can show that, when restricted to S 2 , only the radial component\nof the spin survives due to the constraint (6). Furthermore, with the choice of ordering constant\n\u03b1G = N\n\n(13)\n\nCG = \u0168B + 2\u03a3,\n\n(14)\n\n1\n\u03a3 \u2261 \u2212 [\u03b2\u0304\u03b1 , \u03b2\u03b1 ]\n2\n\n(15)\n\nthe Gauss law constraint, Eq. (10) can be written as\n\nwhere\n\ncan be identified as the radial component of the total spin.3 This expression can be obtained by directly imposing\nthe constraints on the total spin Si and the eigenvalues range from \u2212 N2 to N2 .\nQuantum mechanical supercharges Q\u03b1 and Q\u0304\u03b1 can be readily obtained from the classical Noether charge because\nthey have no ordering ambiguity,\nQ\u03b1 = p * \u03c8\u03b1 + iz\u0304\u03c3i \u03c8\u03b1 Ii ,\n\nQ\u0304\u03b1 = \u03c8\u0304\u03b1 * p\u0304 \u2212 i\u03c8\u0304\u03b1 \u03c3i zIi .\n\nOne can further show that they can be rewritten in the following suggestive form:\nQ \u03b1 = J+ \u03b2 \u03b1 ,\n\nQ\u0304\u03b1 = J\u2212 \u03b2\u0304\u03b1 ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\nJ+ \u2261 2\u2207t z\u0304\u01ebz\u0304 = iz\u0304\u03c3i \u01ebz\u0304Ji\nJ\u2212 \u2261 2\u01ebz\u2207t z = \u2212i\u01ebz\u03c3i zJi .\n\n(17)\n\nTogether with the radial component of the angular momentum,\n1\n1\nJr = \u2212 \u0168B + Ir = \u2212 CG + (\u03a3 + Ir ),\n2\n2\n\n(18)\n\nJ\u00b1 satisfy the usual SU (2) algebra relations:\n[J+ , J\u2212 ] = 2Jr , [Jr , J+ ] = J+ , [Jr , J\u2212 ] = \u2212J\u2212 .\n\n3\n\nIn this paper we define \u03a3 to be the outward radial component of the spin operator, so it differs from that of Ref.

It is supersymmetric and rotationally invariant, and corresponds to quantizing the classical\nHamiltonian with a specific choice of the ordering parameters C, D in Eq. (11). The second term represents the\nspin-isospin coupling and the third term may be interpreted as the spin-spin coupling which becomes trivial when\nN = 1, but not in general.\nFrom Eqs.

If the number of fermion\nspecies is one, i.e., N = 1, Eq. (22) simply becomes [Q, Q\u0304] = 2(H + 18 ) which is the ordinary N = 1 SUSY algebra.\nIf N = 2, it can be shown that \u03a3S\u03b2\u03b1 = 0 identically and the algebra reduces to\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n[Q\u03b1 , Q\u0304\u03b2 ] = 2H\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 2Ir S\u03b2\u03b1 + \u03a3\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 .\n2\n\n(23)\n\nThis algebra can be cast in the form which is identical to the SU (2|1) algebra. For general N the algebra is nonlinear.\nThe commutator algebra given in Eq. (9) can be concretely represented on the Hilbert space composed of certain\nfunctions on S 3 as follows:\nBm = \u2212iAnm\n\n\u2202\n+ iz\u0304m ,\n\u2202zn\n\nB\u0304m = \u2212iAmn\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202 z\u0304n\n\n\u0168B = zm\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 z\u0304m\n.\n\u2202zm\n\u2202 z\u0304m\n\nOperators z and z\u0304 act as multiplication, and the fermion operators and the isospin can be represented as usual in\nterms of matrices. From these, representations for other physical operators can be obtained. In particular, we find\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n1\n\u2202\nz\u0304\u03c3i\nJi =\n\u2212\n\u03c3i z + Ii .\n(24)\n2\n\u2202 z\u0304 \u2202z\n\n\f7\nLet us study energy eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (21). Since Ji is the sum of two commuting angular\nmomentum operators Ki and Ii and the isospin is easy to handle, first consider the representation theory of Ki .\nBesides K 2 , K3 there is another operator commuting with them, which is the radial component Kr of Ki . Let\n|k, k3 , kr i be their simultaneous eigenstates. It can be shown that kr behaves exactly as k3 relative to k, i.e., they are\ninteger spaced and for a given k, \u2212k \u2264 kr \u2264 k. In fact, as k3 is raised and lowered by K1 \u00b1 iK2 , kr is raised and\nlowered by K\u00b1 defined as in Eq. (17). Thus, one can construct all |k, k3 , kr i starting from\n|k, k3 = k, kr = ki \u223c z\u030412k\n\n(25)\n\nvia a successive application of the lowering operators K1 \u2212 iK2 and K\u2212 . For instance, one finds\n|k, k3 = k, kr i \u223c z2k\u2212kr z\u03041k+kr .\n\n(26)\n\nThey are in fact monopole harmonics.4\nSince the Hamiltonian is made of J 2 and Ir , we need a complete set of commuting operators containing them. We\ncan choose J~2 , J3 , Kr , I 2 , Ir and \u03a3. Since the Gauss law constraint (18) can be written in terms of these operators as\nKr = \u03a3, the problem reduces to constructing the simultaneous eigenstates of J~2 , J3 , I 2 , Ir , \u03a3 from the simultaneous\neigenstates of K 2 , K3 , I 2 , I3 , \u03a3. This can be done in general but for the sake of simplicity we will consider 12 -isospin\ncase. Since Ir2 = 14 in this case, the energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian (21) is determined by j. Other quantum\nnumbers represent degeneracies. Let I3 = 12 \u03c33 . Among the eigenstates of Ir we choose the ones having j = 0. They\nare given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nz1\n\u2212z\u03042\n|j = 0, ir = +1/2i =\n, |j = 0, ir = \u22121/2i =\n.\n(27)\nz2\nz\u03041\nNow, it can be shown that the simultaneous eigenfunctions of J~2 , J3 , I 2 , Ir and \u03a3 can be obtained by taking the\nproduct of three states\n|j, j3 , ir , \u03c3i = |j = 0, ir i|j, j3 , \u03c3 + ir i|\u03c3i,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere |j, j3 , \u03c3 + ir i is the monopole harmonics previously defined. We have omitted I 2 because it is constant.\nWe illustrate some cases. First, let us consider N = 1 case. In this case, \u03c3 = \u00b11/2. The ground states are\ncharacterized by j = 0, for which j3 = 0 and jr = 0. The latter condition implies that \u03c3 + ir = 0. Consequently, the\nground states consist of the following two states with E = \u22121/8:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212z\u03042\n|0, 0, \u2212 , + i = |0, \u2212 i|0, 0, 0i| + i =\n| + i,\nz\u03041\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\n1 1\nz1\n| \u2212 i.\n|0, 0, + , \u2212 i = |0, + i|0, 0, 0i| \u2212 i =\nz2\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\nNote that ir = \u03c3 = \u00b11/2 states are not allowed. One can check that the both states are annihilated by Q and Q\u0304.\nThe first exited states correspond to the value of j = 1. In this case, j3 = (1, 0, \u22121), ir = \u00b11/2, \u03c3 = \u00b11/2. Therefore,\nthere are twelve states with E = 7/8:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n1\n1\n1\nz1\n|1, (1, 0, \u22121), + , + i = |0, + i|1, (1, 0, \u22121), 1i| + i = z\u0304 z\u0304\n| + i,\nz2\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212z\u03042\n|1, (1, 0, \u22121), \u2212 , + i = |0, \u2212 i|1, (1, 0, \u22121), 0i| + i = z z\u0304\n| + i,\nz\u03041\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n1\n1\n1\nz1\n|1, (1, 0, \u22121), + , \u2212 i = |0, + i|1, (1, 0, \u22121), 0i| \u2212 i = z z\u0304\n| \u2212 i,\nz2\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\n1 1\n\u2212z\u03042\n| \u2212 i,\n(29)\n|1, (1, 0, \u22121), \u2212 , \u2212 i = |0, \u2212 i|1, (1, 0, \u22121), \u22121i| \u2212 i = zz\nz\u03041\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere the omitted indices on zz, z z\u0304 and z\u0304 z\u0304 are determined depending on the values of j3 and \u03c3 + ir . For instance\nfrom Eq. (26), one can infer that in the first line of Eq. (29), each j3 = (1, 0, \u22121) corresponds to z\u0304 z\u0304 = (z\u030412 , z\u03041 z\u03042 , z\u030422 ),\n\n4\n\nThe monopole harmonics Yq,l,m of Ref. [10] corresponds to our |k, k3 , kr i with k = l, k3 = m, kr = \u2212q.\n\n\f8\nin the second line z z\u0304 = (z2 z\u03041 , |z2 |2 \u2212 |z1 |2 , z1 z\u03042 ) and in the fourth line zz = (z22 , z1 z2 , z12 ). In general, the energy\neigenfunctions with j, j3 , ir , \u03c3 are given by the states\n|0, ir i|j, j3 , \u03c3 + ir i|\u03c3i,\nwith an arbitrary integer j, j3 (\u2212j \u2264 j3 \u2264 j), and ir , \u03c3 satisfying \u2212j \u2264 \u03c3 + ir \u2264 j.\nNext, let us consider N = 2 case. We have \u03c3 = +1, 0, 0, \u22121, and the corresponding four spin states will be denoted\nby | + 1i, |0\u00b1 i, | \u2212 1i. Since ir = \u00b11/2 and jr = \u03c3 + ir = (3/2, 1/2, \u22121/2, \u22123/2), j can be half integral. Also, jr\nshould satisfy \u2212j \u2264 jr \u2264 j. The ground states correspond to j = 1/2 states and are given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n1\n1 1\n\u2212z\u03042\n| + 1i,\n|0, \u2212 i| , (+ , \u2212 ), + i| + 1i = z\u0304\nz\u03041\n2 2\n2 2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n1\n1 1\nz1\n|0\u00b1 i\n|0, + i| , (+ , \u2212 ), + i|0\u00b1 i = z\u0304\nz2\n2 2\n2 2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n1 1\n1\n\u2212z\u03042\n|0, \u2212 i| , (+ , \u2212 ), \u2212 i|0\u00b1 i = z\n|0\u00b1 i\nz\u03041\n2 2\n2 2\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n1 1\n1\nz1\n|0, + i| , (+ , \u2212 ), \u2212 i| \u2212 1i = z\n| \u2212 1i.\nz2\n2 2\n2 2\n2\nAltogether, there are twelve independent ground states with energy E = 1/4. Again omitted indices depend on\nthe values of j3 . In the first and second line j3 = (+1/2, \u22121/2) corresponds to (z\u03041 , z\u03042 ), and in the last two lines\nj3 = (+1/2, \u22121/2) correspond to (z2 , z1 ). It can be shown that the above ground states are invariant under the half\nof supersymmetry, and supersymmetry is, in some sense, spontaneously broken from N = 2 to N = 1.\nThe analysis can be extended to the general N . Spin states can be obtained using the representation\n\u03b21 = 1 \u2297 1 \u2297 * * * 1 \u2297 \u03c3\u2212 ,\n\u03b22 = 1 \u2297 1 \u2297 * * * \u03c3\u2212 \u2297 \u03c33 ,\n***\n\u03b2N = \u03c3\u2212 \u2297 \u03c33 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c33 ,\nand the eigenvalues of the spin operator is given by \u03c3 = (N /2, N /2 \u2212 1, * * * \u2212 N /2 + 1, \u2212N /2). For N = odd integer,\nthe ground states are given by |0, \u22131/2i|0, 0, 0i| \u00b1 1/2i, and the supersymmetry is unbroken. For N = even integer,\nthe ground states are given by |0, \u22131/2i|1/2, (+1/2, \u22121/2), \u00b11/2i| \u00b1 1i and |0, \u00b11/2i|1/2, (+1/2, \u22121/2), \u00b11/2i|0i, and\nhalf of the supersymmetries is spontaneously broken.\nIn summary, we showed that the number of supersymmetries can be made arbitrarily large for supersymmetric\nisospin particles on sphere in the background of specifically chosen spherically symmetric SU (2) gauge field. The\nsupersymmetry generators form the standard N = 1 SUSY algebra for a single complex fermion, su(2|1) algebra\nfor N = 2. But for higher N , it become the nonlinear realization of the su(N |1) algebra. We also gave exact\nenergy spectra and corresponding eigenfunctions in the case of I = 1/2 and found that half of the supersymmetry\nis spontaneously broken if the complex number of fermion degrees of freedom is even. It would be interesting to\ninvestigate details of the nonlinear algebra Eq. (22) and extend the analysis further to general values of isospin I\nother than 1/2.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Bum-Hoon Lee and Jin-Ho Cho for useful discussions.
