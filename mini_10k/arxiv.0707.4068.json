Indeed, from a practical\npoint of view, this process is considered a useful tool for\nthe optimal distribution of quantum information carried\nby N qubits into several quantum channels and for the\ntransmission of information contained in a system into\ncorrelations between many systems. On a more fundamental level, it has been suggested that, in the domain of\nquantum optics, the cloning process can also be adopted\nto investigate the intriguing transition of the quantum\nbehavior from the \"microscopic world \", represented here\nby one of few properly encoded photons, to the mesoscopic and macroscopic one composed by many particles\n[4, 6].\nIn quantum optics, the qubit is generally implemented\n\u2192\nby exploiting the polarization state \u2212\n\u03c0 of a single photon. It is there natural to associate a cloning map with\nthe process of stimulated emission [7]. In the present\nframework, the quantum injected - optical parametric\namplifier (QI-OPA), which exploits the process of stimulated emission in a nonlinear (NL) crystal, has led to\nthe experimental realization of the 1 to 2 cloning machine in different configurations [8, 9, 10]. Recently, the\ncoherence-preserving character of high-gain OPA allowed\nthe reproduction of the quantum superposition condition\nof an input single-particle qubit \u03b1 |Hi + \u03b2 |V i, where |Hi\nand |V i are respectively single photon state of horizontal\n\u2212\n\u2192\n(\u2192\n\u03c0 H ) and vertical (\u2212\n\u03c0 V ) polarization, in a multi-particle\namplified output field involving an average of \u2243 6 clones\n[11]. The adoption of more powerful amplifier operating\nat the quantum level could open new perspectives for the\ngeneration of unique quantum states for the implementation of new tests of fundamental physics and innovative\nprotocols for quantum metrology [12].\nThe present work reports the optical parametric amplification of a single photon in the high gain regime to\nexperimentally investigate how the information initially\n\nPBS O/2 O/4 At\n\nUZ=e-iMVZ/2\nP+ / D+\n\nP-\n\nZ\n\nLUV k'\nP\n\nCrystal 2\nSM fiber\nBBO\nDM\n\nPBS\nO/2\nO/2\nL'UV\n\nO/2\nkP\n\nAnalysis\nsetup\n\nLDM\n\nk1\n\nIF\n\nk1\n\nCrystal 1 k2\nBBO\n\nPBS\n\nB\n\nSM fiber\n\nD2\n\nO/4 O/2\nIF\n\nFIG. 1: Optical configuration of the quantum injected optical\nparametric amplifier. The SPDC quantum injector (crystal 1)\nis provided by a type II generator of polarization entangled\nphoton couples. Crystal 2, realizing the OPA action, is cut for\ncollinear type II phase matching. Both crystals are 1.5 mm\nthick. The fields are coupled to single mode (SM) fiber. The\nUV beam was focused on crystal 2 with L\u2032U V (focal length\n= 30 cm). Bloch sphere representation of the input qubit.\n\ncontained in its polarization state is distributed over a\nlarge number of particles. In particular we analyze how\nthe coherence properties of the input state are transferred\nto the mesoscopic output field. Fringe patterns have been\nobserved for output fields involving up to 4\u00d7103 photons.\nThe adopted QI-OPA configuration is the highly efficient collinear regime [13], which generates pairs of photons over the same output spatial mode k1 . This transformation realizes the optimal distribution of quantum\ninformation for qubits restricted to a subspace of the polarization space [14]. Specifically, here we consider the\noptimal process for equatorial qubit of the corresponding Bloch sphere: |\u03c6i = 2\u22121/2 (|Hi + ei\u03c6 |V i) (Fig.1);\nsince the information is codified in the phase \u03c6 of the\ninput qubit, the process is called phase-covariant cloning\n\n\f2\n[15, 16]. The partial a-priori information on the qubit\nto be cloned leads to a high visibility coherence of the\ngenerated multiphoton superposition.\nThe experimental layout is sketched in Figure 1. The\nexcitation source is a Ti:Sa Coherent MIRA mode-locked\nlaser further amplified by a Ti:Sa regenerative REGA\ndevice operating with pulse duration 180f s at a repetition rate of 100kHz with average output power equal to\n720 mW . The output beam, frequency-doubled by second harmonic generation, provides the excitation beam of\nUV wavelength (wl) \u03bbP = 397.5nm and power 300mW .\nThe UV beam is splitted in two beams through a \u03bb/2\nwaveplate and a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and excites two BBO (\u03b2-barium borate) NL crystals cut for type\nII phase-matching. Crystal 1, excited by the beam kP ,\nis the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)\nsource of entangled photon couples of wl \u03bb = 2\u03bbP , emitted over the two output modes ki (i = 1, 2) in the singlet\n1\nstate |\u03a8\u2212 ik1,k2 =2\u2212 2 (|Hik1 |V ik2 \u2212 |V ik1 |Hik2 ). The\npump power of beam kP is set in order to have a negligible probability to generate two pairs of photons. While\nthe photon associated to mode k2 is coupled into a single\nmode fiber and excites the single photon counting module (SPCM) D2 (hereafter referred to as trigger mode),\nthe single photon state generated over the mode k1 is\ninjected, together with an UV pump beam (mode k\u2032P ),\ninto the non-linear crystal 2 and stimulates the emission\nof many photon pairs. By virtue of the nonlocal correlation acting on modes k1 and k2 , the input qubit on mode\n1\nk1 is prepared in the state |\u03c6ik1 = 2\u2212 2 (|Hik1 +ei\u03c6 |V ik1 )\nby measuring the photon on mode k2 in the appropriate\npolarization basis. This measurement is carried out by\nadopting a set \u03bb/2 + \u03bb/4 waveplates, a phase shifter\n(B) and a polarizing beam-splitter P BS. By an adjustable spatial delay (Z), the time superposition in the\nOPA of the excitation UV pulse and of the injection photon wavepacket is ensured. The injected single photon\nand the UV pump beam k\u2032P are superposed exploiting a\ndichroic mirror (DM ) with high reflectivity at \u03bbP and\nhigh transmittivity at \u03bb.\nThe crystal 2 is oriented for collinear operation over\nthe two linear polarization modes, respectively horizontal and vertical.

The main feature\nof this Hamiltonian is its peculiar property of phasecovariance for qubits with equatorial polarization, leading to the optimality of the cloning process.

The multi-particle states |\u03a6i , |\u03a6i are\nj\ni\northonormal, i.e. h\u03a6|\u03a6i = \u03b4ij . Similar expressions holds\n\u2192\n\u2192\nfor any equatorial pair of polarizations {\u2212\n\u03c0 \u03c6, \u2212\n\u03c0 \u03c6\u22a5 } due\nto the phase-covariance of the overall process: |\u03a6i\u03c6 =\nH\nV\n2\u22121/2 (|\u03a6i +ei\u03c6 |\u03a6i ). Note that the state |\u03a3ik1,k2 , generally dubbed \"Schroedinger Cat State\" keeps its singlet\ncharacter in the multi-particle regime, and expresses the\nnonlocal correlations between two distant objects: the\nmicroscopic ( sigle particle) system expressed by the trigger state (mode k2 ) and the mesoscopic ( multiparticle)\nsystem (k1 ) [17, 18].\nLet us analyze the output field k1 over the polarization\n\u2192\nmodes \u2212\n\u03c0 \u00b1 when the state |\u03c6ik1 is injected. The average\n\u2192\nphoton number N\u00b1 over k1 with \u2212\n\u03c0 \u00b1 is found to depend\non the phase \u03c6 as follows: N\u00b1 (\u03c6) = m + 21 (2m + 1)(1 \u00b1\ncos \u03c6) with m = sinh2 g. The conditions \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = \u03c0\ncorrespond to single-photon injection and no-injection of\n\u2192\nthe mode \u2212\n\u03c0 + , respectively. The average photon number\nrelated to both cases is: N+ (0) = 3m+1 and N+ (\u03c0) = m.\nFor \u03c6 = 0, the average number of photons emitted over\nthe two polarizations over k1 is found to be M = 4m + 1.\n\u2192\nWe conclude that the output state with polarization \u2212\n\u03c0\u00b1\nexhibits a sinusoidal fringe pattern of the field intensity\ndepending on \u03c6 with a gain-dependent visibility V th =\n2m+1\n4m+1 [13].

The latter one was contributed by the fiber coupling (\u223c 50%), IF transmittivity (\u223c 25%) and detector's quantum efficiency (\u03b7QE ).\nBy setting g = 0 the effective visibility of the input qubit\nwas measured: Vin = (78.4 \u00b1 5.1) % , a result attributed\nto double-pairs emission from crystal 1. By subtracting\nthese accidental coincidences the input qubit visibility\nwas raised to (96.5 \u00b1 2.5) %.\n\nIn order to investigate how the coherence of the input\nqubit survives to the amplification process, we measured\nthe fringe pattern visibilities of the output field for different values of the gain value of the OPA. The interference\nproperty of the output field implied by the quantum superposition character of the input qubit |\u03c6ik1 was mea\u2192\nsured in the basis \u2212\n\u03c0 \u00b1 over the output \"cloning\" mode\nk1 by signals of P+ and P\u2212 conditioned by the detection\nof a single photon from D2 for different phases of the injected qubit. Figure 2 reports the gain dependence of the\nnumber of clones rescaled by the visibility of the input\nqubit Vin . The solid line reports the best fit curve with\ne th which incorporates the main exa theoretical model V\ne th = p(2m+1) . There the\nperimental imperfections: V\np(2m+1)+2m\nparameter p represents the probability that the injected\nheralded photon over the detected modes gives rise to\nstimulated emission. It differs from 1 because of the partial mismatches between the amplifying pump beam and\nthe input single photon state. By fitting the experimental data we found p=0.40 \u00b1 0.01 (Fig.3-b), which is in\nagreement with a theoretical estimation obtained by the\nexpression p \u2243 T \u00d7 \u2206\u03bd \u00d7 \u2206k where T is transmittivity\nbetween the two crystals (T = 0.90), \u2206\u03bd is the spectral\nmatching (\u2206\u03bd \u223c 0.8) and \u2206k is the spatial matching\n(\u2206k \u223c 0.6). To enlighten the resilience of coherence of\nthe output state, we can compare in Figure 2b the experimental data with the dotted curve which refers to V th and\nthe dashed curve V nc which represents the visibility that\n\nThe direct correlation measurement was also carried\nout for a gain value equal to gmax : Figure 3. There\nthe corresponding signals I+ and I\u2212 , averaged over 2500\ntriggered pulse, are reported versus the phase \u03c6 of the\ninput qubit. The overall number of photons is equal\nto M \u223c 4000 while the rescaled visibility of the fringe\npattern is found: V = (19.4 \u00b1 1.8)%. These coherence patterns are the main experimental result of the\npresent article as it shows how a single photon quantum superposition state coherently drives a field with\nlarge number of photons. Very important, the interference fringe patterns given in Figure 3 have been experimentally observed for all orthogonal bases belonging to\nthe equatorial plane of the Bloch sphere of Fig.1 e.g.,\n1 \u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u03c0 H \u2212 i\u2212\n\u03c0 V ), \u2212\n\u03c0L = \u2212\n\u03c0\u22a5\n{\u2212\n\u03c0 R = 2\u2212 2 (\u2212\nR } confirming the\nH\nV\nand \u03a6 .\ncoherence between \u03a6\nWe address now the problem of the distinguishabil\u03c6\n\u03c6\u22a5\nity between |\u03a6i and |\u03a6i , which are mutually orthogonal as shown by Equation 2, e.g., |\u03a6i\u00b1 . A perfect discrimination between these two states can be\nachieved in principle in a single run experiment by\nchecking whether the number of photons over the k1\n\u2192\nmode with polarization \u2212\n\u03c0 + is even or odd. Such measurement\ncorresponds\nto\nestimating the operator sz =\nP\u221e\n[|2n\n+\n1i\nh2n\n+\n1|\n\u2212\n|2ni h2n|] over the field k1 with\nn=0\n\u2192\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\npolarization \u2212\n\u03c0 + . Indeed is: s1+\nz |\u03a6 i = \u00b1 |\u03a6 i. The\n1+\nexact implementation of the operator sz requires a\nphoton-number resolving detection of a mesoscopic field\nk1 , i.e. made up by thousands of photons. This is indeed well beyond the range of possibilities offered by the\npresent technology [21]. Hence we could ask whether the\nneed for such extremely fine-grained resolution could be\nbypassed by adopting a different approach. Let us report\nin Figure 4 the 3-dimensional representations of the two\nprobability distributions of the number of photons which\n\u00b1\nare associated with the two states |\u03a6i . These distributions are drawn as functions of the variables m and n\nwhich are proportional to the size of the electronic signals\nI+ and I\u2212 simultaneously registered, in any single-shot\nexperiment, by the detectors P+ and P\u2212 , respectively.\nPrecisely, I+ \u221d m \u2243 2i, I\u2212 \u221d n \u2243 2j, according to\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4: Theoretical distribution probability of (n+ , n\u2212 ) for\n|\u03a6i\u00b1 (g = 1.6).\n\nQ\u00b1\n(m, n) as the probabilEquation 2. Let us refer to\nity that a single-shot measurement (I+ , I\u2212 ) = (m, n) is\n\u00b1\nactually due to aQrealizationQof the state |\u03a6i . Since by\n+\n\u2212\nEq. 2 is found\n(m, n)/\n(m, n) = m/n \u2261 h for\n2i >> 1 and 2j >> 1, we may conclude that the measured signal (I+ , I\u2212 ) can be attributed to the realization\nof the state |\u03a6i+ or to |\u03a6i\u2212 if the measured quantity\nh = I+ /I\u2212 = m/n is h >> 1 or h << 1 , respectively. In\nthis way we can exploit the macroscopic character of the\noutput field, a continuous variable system, by a simple\nphoton detection technique. By finding an appropriate\nfiltering function W (m, n), viz a weighting function of\nthe output data (I+ , I\u2212 ), the visibility of the detected\nfringe pattern can be raised to a value close to 1.\n100\n\nVisibility (%)\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nPercentage (%)\n\nFIG. 5: Visibility of the intensity versus the percentage of\ndata which has not been discarded within the filtering procedure. The solid line reports the best fit with the function\nf (x) = a\u2212b ln(x+c). The percentage of discarded data scales\n\u2243 e\u2212q .\n\nLet us now implement experimentally the filtering technique. In order to do that in a sensible way we should\nconsider two sources of errors: (1) The limited detection\nefficiency \u03b7 << 1. However\nQ\u00b1 this effect may smooth the\nprobability distributions\n(m, n) with no significant effect on the ratio h. (2) The spontaneous emission contribution added to the \"stimulated\" one. A discrimination\nbetween these latter contributions is obtained by selecting output data with large (I+ + I\u2212 ), which are most\nlikely generated in the stimulated regime. In our single-\n\nshot experiment we discarded the data with |m \u2212 n| < q\nfor different values of q. Of course, since any such selection reduces the rate of measurement, a convenient\ntrading off was found necessary. Figure 5 reports the visibilities of the fringe patterns obtained by filtering the experimental data related to Figure 3 versus the percentage\nof registered data. The behavior is found in agreement\nwith a refined theoretical filtering model. Interestingly,\nby the visibility values it is possible to demonstrate the\nquantum character of the mesoscopic output field. Indeed if the coherence of a general input qubit was not\npreserved during the amplification, the process could be\ndescribed as a classical channel. Consequently the fidelity\nof the overall transformation would be, at most, equal\nto the optimal estimation fidelity for equatorial qubits:\nFest = 43 [15, 22]. Fig.5 achieves fidelity values above\n)\nthe classical threshold value: F = (1+V\n> Fest con2\nfirming the quantum character of the process. The same\nvisibility have been observed for different pairs of input\nequatorial qubit, as said. The ability to discriminate the\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\u22a5\noutput {|\u03a6i , |\u03a6i }by the above technique opens interesting perspectives for testing quantum nonlocality in\nthe \"macroscopic\" regime, such as a verification of the\nBell's theorem.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the interference\nproperties of the output state in agreement with the\nquantum theoretical results. We reported the experimental realization of a quantum cloning machine within two\nnew scenarios: (a) the optimal phase-covariant cloning\nbased on the process of stimulated emission, (b) the very\nlarge number of clones M = 4000 >> 1. The present\nwork represents the first step toward an experimental interface between single qubit systems and continuous variable ones. The attempt to shed light on the quantum-toclassical transition by distributing the information from\na single quantum system to many ones deserves further\ninvestigation.
