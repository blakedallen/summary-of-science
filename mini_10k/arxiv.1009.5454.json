When two nuclei collide,\nformation of compound nucleus takes place then\nthis compound nucleus breaks into several\nmedium, light mass fragments along with the\nemission of free nucleons in all possible\ndirections. This phenomenon is termed as\n'Multifragmentation'. The observation of\nmultifragment configuration would correspond\nto the state of matter intermediate between\nnuclear liquid (nucleus close to its ground state)\nand nuclear vapor (assembly of nucleons and\nlighter mass fragments at high temperature). The\nhope to establish a link to the liquid-gas phase\ntransition in the nuclear matter has been the\nmajor motivation for the research and study of\nmultifragment decay of the heavy nuclei in\nrecent years . The multifragmentation studied by\nexperimentalist vastly in the past decade for\nsymmetrical and asymmetrical systems [1]. The\nfindings of the symmetrical systems are verified\nby theoretician many times, but, limited efforts\nwere done to verify the data of asymmetric\ncolliding nuclei.\nWe have studied the fragment production\nmechanism in the set of four reactions\n197\nAu79+12C6, 197Au79+26Al13, 197Au79+63Cu29 and\n197\nAu79+208Pb82. The reactions are simulated at\nan energy 600 MeV/nucleon and collision\ngeometry is varied from central to peripheral\n( = b/bmax = 0 to 1). A theoretical investigation\nhas been carried out on the study of mass\ndependence of intermediate mass fragments\n(5\u2264A\u2264Atot/6) and other fragments. This work has\nbeen carried out within the frame work of\nisospin dependent quantum molecular dynamics\n(IQMD) model.\n\nThe Model: IQMD\nThe IQMD model has been successfully\nused for the analysis of large number of\nobservables. It is a N-body theory which\nsimulates heavy ion reaction at intermediate\nenergies on an event by event basis [2]. This is\nan improved version of QMD model and is based\non molecular dynamics picture & it includes\n1. Isospin dependent Coulomb potential\n2. Symmetry Potential\n3. N-N cross-sections\nAn IQMD simulation needs three steps\nwhich are explained below\n1) Initialization of nucleon: In this step,\neach nucleon is represented by Gaussian\nwave packet given as:\n=\n2) Propagation\nThe nucleons are propagated under the\ntotal interaction calculated by the\nHamiltonian equations of motion:\n=\n\n,\n\n=-\n\nWhere\n=\nis the Hamiltonian\nVij\n= VijSkyrme+VijYukawa+Vijmdi+VijCoul+Vijsym\nis the total interaction potential.\n3) N-N Collision\nCollision between two nucleons takes\nplace only if\n\n\fIn the fig.1, we have displayed the\nmultiplicity of free nucleons and light mass\nfragments (LMF's) as a function of the system\nmass at the different impact parameters for three\n(197Au79+12C6, 197Au79+26Al13 and 197Au79+63Cu29)\ndifferent reactions. Both free nucleons and\nLMF's show increasing trends for central\ncollisions. With the increase in the size of\nsystem, number of the participant nucleons\nincreases. This will lead to more thermalization\nof the system. Due to this reason, increase in\nmultiplicity of these fragments which originate\nfrom the participant zone. But as one move\ntowards the peripheral collisions, the amount of\nfree nucleons and LMF's decreases as participant\nregion decreases.\n300\n\nb\u0302\nb\u0302\n\n250\n200\n\n= 0.0\n\nFree Nucleons\n\n= 0.1\n\nbecause MST method gives one heavy cluster at\nthe time of high density.
