LUBLINSKY\nDepartment of Physics, Technion \u2013 Israeli Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000,\nISRAEL\nE-mail: mal@techunix.technion.ac.il\nWe suggest a new procedure for extrapolating the parton distributions from HERA\nto much higher energies. The procedure suggested consists of two steps. First, we\nsolve the non-linear evolution equation. Second, we introduce a correcting function for which we write a DGLAP-type linear evolution equation. The nonlinear\nequation is solved numerically and estimates for the saturation scale, as well as for\nthe gluon density at THERA and LHC energies are made.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the present talk we present a new approach for extrapolation of the parton\ndensities to low x1 . By low x we mean values up to 10\u22127 , which correspond\nto the energy range potentially covered by the THERA and LHC.\nA conventional approach to parton density evolution is based on the linear\nDGLAP equation which describes the gluon radiation leading to an increase\nin the number of partons. However, at low x the parton cascade become dense\nand the recombination processes start to be important. We are convinced that\nsuch system cannot be described by a linear evolution any more.\nOur motivation is based on two main problems of the DGLAP evolution.\nFirst, it predicts a very steep growth of parton distributions at low x violating\nthe unitarity constraints. The second problem is common for all perturbative\nseries which are asymptotic. In application to DIS processes it leads to twist\nOPE break down at low x, when the high twists become of the same order as\nthe leading one. We believe that a non-linear evolution is a solution to both\nproblems! The non-linear evolution accounts for the saturation effects due to\nhigh parton density and it sums high twist contributions.\n2\n\nNew approach for extrapolating the parton distributions\n\nIn the colour dipole picture the evolution is applied to the imaginary part of\nthe dipole elastic scattering amplitude N (r\u22a5 , x; b) for the dipole of the size r\u22a5\nelastically scattered at the impact parameter b. The amplitude N is the major\nunknown to be determined. Our approach to the problem is based on two steps\nin which we obtain N as a sum of two terms: N = \u00d1 + \u2206N . As the first step,\n1\n\n\f0.8\n0.6\nN\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n\u03b1s \u2212 run\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n\u03b1 s = 0.25\n-4\n\nx=10\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4 0.6\nr(fm)\n\n0.8\n\n\u03b1s \u2212 run\n\u03b1s = 0.25\n-3\n\nx=10\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4 0.6\nr(fm)\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 1. Solutions of the Eq. (1) as a function of distance.\n\nthe function \u00d1 is found as a solution of the non-linear evolution equation (1).\nThis equation is valid in the leading ln(x) approximation of QCD. Moreover,\nit does not describe correctly the evolution at very short distances. In order to\nimprove we perform the second step of our program: the correcting function\n\u2206N is introduced to incorporate the correct DGLAP kernel at short distances.\nFor \u2206N we write down a DGLAP-type linear evolution equation.\nThe non-linear evolution equation for the function \u00d1 has the form:\n\u2212\n\nd\u00d1 (r01 , x)\nCF \u03b1s\n=\nd ln x\n\u03c02\n\nZ\n\nd2 r2\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\nr01\n2\n\u00d1\n(r\n,\nx)\n\u2212\n\u00d1\n(r\n,\nx)\n\u00d1\n(r\n,\nx)\n(1)\n02\n02\n12\n2 r2\nr02\n12\n\nThe above equation was derived in quite different approaches to high density\nQCD2 and hence we believe it to be a very reliable tool. The equation (1)\nis derived for the large number of colors Nc and for a constant \u03b1s . We have\ndropped the b-dependence implying the large b limit. Having assumed b to\nbe large we will allow to ourselves to extrapolate back to b = 0. The nonlinear equation (1) is a subject to certain initial conditions, which we set at\nx0 = 10\u22122 . The initial conditions are taken in the Glauber-Mueller form.\n3\n\nNumerical solution\n\nThe equation (1) is solved numerically by the method of iterations1 for b = 0.\nThe solutions are obtained for the fixed \u03b1s = 0.25 and for the one loop\nrunning \u03b1s . The figure 1 presents examples of the solutions as a function\nof distance. The solutions display a step like behavior consistent with all\ntheoretical predictions. At short distances the function \u00d1 tends to zero, while\nat large distances it approaches unity, which is the unitarity bound.\n\n2\n\n\f14\nQ 12\ns 10\n\u03b1s =0.25\n8\n(GeV) 6\n4 \u03b1 - run\n2 s\n0\n-7 -6 -5 -4\nlg (x)\n\n150\n\n-7\n\n-3\n\n2\n\n800\n\n2\n\nQ = 2 (GeV )\n\nxG 125\n100\n75\n50\n25\n\nFigure 2.

Gluon density as a function of lg x.\n\n4\n\nResults\n\nBasing on the above solutions several physical quantities can be determined.\n\u2022 The saturation scale Qs (x) is estimated as a typical scale where the\nfunction \u00d1 undergoes the step like transition shown above. Though no exact\nmathematical definition of the saturation scale is known we proposed several\nreasonable definitions which in average produce our predictions depicted in\nthe figure 2.\n\u2022 The solutions found display the scaling phenomena. Namely, the function \u00d1 is not a function of two independent variables x and r\u22a5 , but a function\nof a single variable \u03c4 = r\u22a5 Qs (x): \u00d1 (x, r\u22a5 ) \u2243 \u00d1 (r\u22a5 Qs (x)). The scaling holds\nwith a few percent accuracy in a broad kinematic domain below x = 10\u22122 .\n\u2022 The gluon density was defined according to the Mueller formula3 , which\nrelates the gluon density to the dipole elastic scattering amplitude. Examples\nof our predictions are shown in the Fig. 3. At small x the gluon density is\ndamped by a factor 2-3 comparing to the DGLAP predictions4 .\n\u2022 The structure function F2 is computed. The experimental data below\nx = 10\u22122 is reproduced with less than 20% error for Q2 \u2264 50 GeV2 . It is\nimportant that the data is reproduced without use of the full DGLAP kernel.\n\u2022 The LO BFKL equation, which is the linear part of the equation (1),\nis solved numerically by the same method of iterations. The obtained results\nare compared in the Fig. 4 with the corresponding solutions of the non-linear\n3\n\n\f1.4\n-4\n1.2 x=10\nBFKL\n1\nN 0.8\n0.6\n0.4\nnon-linear\n0.2\n0\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\nr(fm)\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nx=10\n\n-5\n\nBFKL\n\nnon-linear\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\nr (fm)\n\nFigure 4. Comparison between the solutions of the LO BFKL equation and the Eq. (1).\n\nequation (1). The solution of the BFKL equation rapidly diverges from the\nsolution of the non-linear equation. We conclude that the shadowing effects\nbecome important before the BFKL dynamics actually takes place.\n5\n\nSummary and plans for the future\n\nA new method for extrapolating the parton densities to high energies was\nproposed. As the first step in our program we solved (numerically) the nonlinear evolution equation (1). From the solutions obtained we estimated the\nsaturation scale as a function of x. We found an approximate scaling behavior\nof the solutions. Both xG and F2 are found to be significantly damped at high\nenergies. We predicted the LO BFKL dynamics unlikely to be ever seen. We\nwork currently on single diffractive dissociation from the non-linear evolution.\nAcknowledgments\nI am especially grateful to Eugene Levin for his cooperation in the presented\nwork.
