The common procedure for studying QM effects for the NLS\nequation is by the use of quantum field theory [4-5,9]. In such approach one uses the field\noperators \u02c6 z, t and \u02c6\u2020 z, t satisfying the boson commutation relations (CR)\n\u02c6 z , t , \u02c6\u2020 z ', t\n\n(z\n\nz ')\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere z is the one dimensional propagation coordinate. For one dimensional Hamiltonians\none uses multiplications of such operators and their derivatives integrated over the z\ncoordinate. Usually QM solutions of NLS equation by using quantum field theories turn to\nbe quite complicated (see e.g. Ref. [9]). In Quantum Optics one can use the conventional\none dimensional equal time CR for the annihilation and creation operators given as\na\u02c6 k , t , a\u02c6 \u2020 k ', t\n\n(k\n\nk ')\n\n(2)\n\nwhere k and k ' are the one dimensional wave vectors. These CR can be converted into\nanother form by using the following Fourier transforms\n\na\u02c6 z , t\n\n1\n2\n\nexp(ikz )a\u02c6 k , t dk ; a\u02c6 \u2020 z ', t\n\n1\n2\n\nexp( ik ' z ')a\u02c6 \u2020 k ', t dk '\n\n.(3)\n\nThen we get\n\na\u02c6 z , t , a\u02c6 \u2020 z ', t\n1\n2\n\nexp ik ( z\n\n1\n2\nz ' dk\n\nk\n(z\n\nz ')\n\nk ' exp(ikz ik ' z ')dkdk '\n.\n\n(4)\n\n\fThis CR will be used in the present analysis of QM effects related to the NLS equation.\nThere are other forms for CR in quantum optics (see e.g. [12]). For various systems\nthe momentum operator \u011c has been used for evaluating quantum mechanical (QM)\npropagation effects including coupling between different momentum modes (see e.g. [1317] ). In the present work we treat, however, one mode of the EM field which includes a\ncoupling between momentum and frequencies due to dispersion relation. For this purpose it\nis useful to treat propagation effects by a coupled Hamiltonian-Momentum operator and to\nuse the CR of Eq. (4) as it is the analog of the quantum field CR of Eq. (1).\nQuantum effects obtained by Kerr interaction have been treated in various articles\n[16-20]. These works have not treated, however, the Kerr propagation effects in solitons.\nHaus [8] and Haus and Lai [21] have developed the quantum theory of soliton squeezing\nusing a linearized approach. Although some of the derivations in the present work are\nsimilar to those presented in [8] the approach for treating Kerr effects is different and more\nsimilar to other conventional quantum optics methods [22], especially for treating quantum\nphases in the soliton. Although we will treat QM effects for the special important case of\none-soliton solution of NLS equation, a similar QM approach can be used for more\ncomplicated solutions of NLS equation.\nThe article is arranged as follows. In Section 2, QM propagation effects for linear\ndispersive wave guide are treated. In Section 3 we analyze the one-soliton solution of the\nNLS equation in which nonlinear Kerr interaction effects are taken into account. In\nconventional QM analysis a\u02c6 \u2020 t a\u02c6 t\n\nrepresents the photon number operator in the\n\nquantization volume while in our analysis a\u02c6 \u2020 z , t a\u02c6 z, t represents the number of photons\nper unit length at coordinates z , t . The total photon number operator n\u0302 in the soliton is\ngiven by\n\na\u02c6 \u2020 z , t a\u02c6 z , t dz\n\nn\u02c6 . Based on these properties we analyze in Section 3\n\n\fpossible QM phases in the one soliton solution of the NLS equation and compare our\nresults with other works. The main point emphasized by the analysis given in this Section\nis that soliton solutions can be related to QM annihilation a\u02c6 z , t and creation a\u02c6 \u2020 z, t\noperators from which quantum phases can be calculated. This approach for the one-soliton\ncase is different from that presented in [8,21] and is more directly related to the ordinary\ntreatment of quantum phenomena by Kerr interactions in other systems [14-18]. In the\npresent analysis we do not consider more complicated phenomena, e.g. losses , diffraction\nat the transverse coordinate, multi-soliton solutions , collisions between solitons etc. [12,10-11].\nNonlinear equations raise the problem how far they are integrable. We show in\nSection 4 that the NLS equation can be related to two first order linear equations operating\non a two-dimensional wavefunction [1-2,6-7,23], where its time dependence is given by\n'Hamiltonian -Matrix' while its space z dependence is given by 'Momentum-Matrix'. The\nintegrability of the nonlinear equations is related to the compatibility-condition between\nthese two matrices and the use of such compatibility-condition is demonstrated for the\nNLS equation. We do not develop in the present article the use of scattering theories as\nthey are usually classical theories (e.g.[1-2], [6-7]) and our aim in the present article is to\ntreat QM Kerr effects which can be done by the methods developed in the Section 3.\nIn Section 5 we summarize our results and conclusions.\n\n2. Propagation of EM waves in a linear dispersive wave guide\nIn treating EM waves in linear dispersive wave guide we encounter the problem that the\nfrequency\n\n(k )\n\nand the wavevector k are coupled by the dispersion relation [8] :\n\n0\n\nk0\n\nd\ndk\n\nk\nk ko\n\nd2\ndk 2\n\nk2\nk ko\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\n\fHere\n\n0\n\nis the resonant frequency corresponding to the wavevector k0 ,\nd\ndk\n\n(6)\n\nvg\nk ko\n\nd2\ndk 2\n\nis the group velocity, and\n\nis the group velocity dispersion. Higher order terms in\nk ko\n\nas function of\n\nthe series expansion of\n\nk are neglected here as we assume that we have\n\nonly a narrow distribution of wavevectors around the central wavevector k0 . We limit the\nanalysis given in the present Section to the one dimensional case.\nThe coupled\n\nHamiltonian-Momentum operator which includes the coupling\n\nbetween frequencies and wavevectors is given as\nH\u02c6\n\nk )a\u02c6 \u2020 ( k0\n\n( k0\n\nk )a\u02c6 ( k0\n\nk )d ( k )\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nBy substituting Eq. (5) into Eq. (7) we get:\n\nH\u02c6\n\n0\n\nd\ndk\n\nk0\n\nIn Eq. (8) a\u02c6 \u2020 ( k0\nk0\n\nd2\ndk 2\n\nk\nk ko\n\nk ) a\u02c6(k0\n\nk 2 a\u02c6 \u2020 ( k0\n\nk )a\u02c6 ( k0\n\nk )d ( k ) . (8)\n\nk ko\n\nk ) represents the number of photons which have momentum\n\nk with the energy given in the square brackets, and this energy is summed over all\n\nmodes represented by the integration over\n\nk . We will transform the dependence of the\n\ncreation and annihilation operators in Eq. (8) on the momentum k0\n\nk to dependence on\n\nthe coordinate z by using the following Fourier transforms:\na\u02c6 (k0\n\nk)\n\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\na\u02c6 \u2020 ( k0\n\nk)\n\na\u02c6 \u2020 ( k0\n\nk )a\u02c6 ( k0\n\na\u02c6 ( z ) exp i k0\na\u02c6 \u2020 ( z ') exp\nk)\n\n1\n2\n\ni ( k0\n\nk z dz ;\nk ) z ' dz ' ;\n\ndz dz 'a\u02c6 \u2020 ( z ')a\u02c6 ( z ) exp i k0\n\n,(9)\nk\n\nz\n\nz'\n\n\fwhere the operators a\u02c6( z ) and a\u02c6 \u2020 ( z ) satisfy the CR given in Eq.

(16)\nThe Hamiltonian of Eq. (15) or of Eq. (16) is the generator for the coupled space-time\npropagation.

(15-16) the Kerr effect represented by nonlinear\nHamiltonian\nH\u02c6 K t\n\nK\ndza\u02c6 \u2020 ( z , t )a\u02c6 \u2020 ( z , t )a\u02c6 ( z , t )a\u02c6 ( z , t )\n2\n\nK\ndzn\u02c6 ( z , t ) n\u02c6 ( z, t ) 1 ,\n2\n\n(23)\n\n\fwhere K is the Kerr constant and n\u02c6 ( z, t )\n\na\u02c6 \u2020 ( z, t )a\u02c6 ( z, t ) ) is the number of photons per unit\n\nlength at coordinates ( z, t ) .\nBy taking into account the nonlinear momentum operator H\u02c6 K the equation of\nmotion for a\u02c6( z , t ) becomes\n#\na\u02c6( z , t )\n#t\n1 d2\ni\n2 dk 2\n\nk ko\n\n#2\na\u02c6 ( z, t )\n#z 2\n\ni\n\na\u02c6 ( z ), H\u02c6 k ( z , t )\n\n1 #2\ni C 2 a\u02c6 ( z, t ) iKa\u02c6 \u2020 ( z , t )a\u02c6 ( z , t )a\u02c6 ( z , t )\n2 #z\n\n.\n\n(24)\nWe have used here Eq. (22) where for simplicity of notation we have omitted the\ntilde and prime from this equation (see the above explanation), and added the CR with H\u02c6 K .\nAlso we have defined in a short notation the constant C\n\nd2\ndk 2\n\nrepresenting the group\nk ko\n\nvelocity dispersion.\nIn the classical description we exchange the operator a\u02c6( z , t ) into its classical\nrepresentation ac ( z, t ) and then we get the NLS classical equation\n#\nac ( z , t )\n#t\n\n1 #2\ni C 2 ac ( z , t ) iKa\u02c6c $ ( z , t )ac ( z , t )ac ( z , t )\n2 #z\n\n.\n\n(25)\n\nThe one-soliton solution of the NLS equation depends on 4 constants: The constant\nx0 representing the pulse center, the carrier frequency of the soliton, arbitrary phase\nconstant % 0 of the soliton and the total intensity of the soliton. The solution of Eq. (24) is\nsimplified by eliminating these constants [7,8]: The constant x0 representing the soliton\ncenter is eliminated by choosing a coordinate system whose origin is at the pulse center.\nThe arbitrary constant phase % 0 of ac ( z, t ) is chosen to be equal to zero. The carrier\nfrequency of the soliton is assumed to coincide with the carrier frequency\n\n0\n\n. The total\n\n\fnumber of photons in the soliton remains as an important parameter . Under these\nassumptions the soliton classical solution of Eq. (25) is given as\nac ( z , t )\n\nA exp i\n\nKA2\nt\n2\n\nsec h\n\nz\n\n,\n\n&\n\n(26)\n\nwith the constraint\nKA2\n\nC\n\n.\n\n&2\n\n(27)\n\nThe normalization constant A is assumed to be real. The complex classical amplitude\nac ( z, t ) is normalized so that by integrating its magnitude squared over\n\nz we get the\n\nnumber n of photons in the soliton as\ndz | ac ( z , t ) |2\n\nA2 sec h 2\n\nz\n\n&\n\ndz\n\n2 A2&\n\nn\n\n.\n\n(28)\n\nWe notice according to Eq. (28) that the number of photons in the soliton is proportional to\nA2 representing the normalization constant squared. The parameter & is related to the\npulse shape. For larger values of & the soliton pulse becomes narrower with a larger\namplitude at the pulse center and larger number of photons. The one-soliton solution of the\nNLS equation represents a balance between linear dispersion, which tends to break up the\nsoliton wave packet, and a focusing effect of the cubic nonlinearity, produced by the\ninteraction of the wave with itself.\nReturning back to the QM equation (24) for a\u02c6( z , t ) its solution under the above\nassumptions can be represented as\na\u02c6 ( z , t )\n\na\u02c6 g ( z , t )\n\nwhere\n\ng ( z, t )\n\nexp i\n\nKA2\nt\n2\n\nsec h\n\nz\n\n&\n\n(29)\n\nWe find the interesting property that the time dependence of the one soliton\nsolution, for both the classical solution (26) and the QM solution (29), is separated from its\n\n\fspace z dependence. These solutions can be illuminated by changing their space z\ndependence into the wavevector k dependence using the Fourier transform\n\n1\n2\n\nF (k )\n\nexp\n\nikz sec h\n\nz\n\n&\n\ndz\n\n&\n\n2\n\nsec h\n\nk&\n2\n\n,\n\n(30)\n\nThen the QM solution of Eq. (29) is transformed into\na\u02c6 ( z , t )\n\na\u02c6 g ( k , t )\n\nwhere\n\ng (k , t )\n\nexp i\n\nKA2\nt\n2\n\nF (k ) .\n\n(31)\n\nEq. (31) has a quite simple explanation showing that in the one-soliton pulse we have a\ncertain distribution of wavevectors producing the wavepacket described in Eq. (29). All\nthese wavevectors have the same time dependence represented by the term\nexp i\n\nKA2\nt\n2\n\n. One needs, however, to take into account that the rapid frequency\n\ndependence exp\n\ni 0 t has been eliminated by using Eq. (19) (omitting for simplicity of\n\nnotation the tilde on operator \u00e2 ). Also the relative simple forms of Eqs. (26-31) are\nobtained under the above simplifying assumptions.\nBoth the classical Eq. (26) and the QM Eq. (29) give information for the one-soliton\nphases and space distributions. We can use a certain integration over the z dependence of\nthe soliton exchanging the classical solution of Eq. (26) into\n\nac ( t )\n\n2& A exp i\n\nKA2\nt\n2\n\n,\n\n(32)\n\nso that in agreement with Eq. (28) we will get\n| ac (t ) |2 n\n\n.\n\n(33)\n\nThe nonlinear Hamiltonian of Eq. (23) has led to the phase term in Eq. (32) .\nThe QM operator corresponding to the complex classical amplitude of Eq. (32) is\ngiven by\n\n\fa\u02c6\n\na\u02c6(0) 2& A exp i\n\nKA2\nt\n2\n\n(34)\n\nA simple QM description of the photon number distribution in the one-soliton pulse can be\nobtained by assuming that the quantum analog of Eq. (32) is given by the coherent state\n\n' (t )\n\n' (0) exp i\n\nKA2\nt\n2\n\nwhere ' (0)\n\n2& A\n\n.\n\n(35)\n\nThe photon number distribution of the one-soliton state becomes then [22]:\n\n' (t )\n\n2& A exp ikA2 t / 2\nn!\n\nn\n\nexp\n\n& A2 n\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nFor each number state n in the coherent photon distribution an additional phase given by\nexp ikA2 tn / 2 is introduced. The phase KA2 tn / 2 is proportional to the photon number\nand to A2 (see Eq.(28)) and increases linearly with time. Similar phases are known to be\nobtained by the ordinary Kerr interactions[18-20].\nOne should take care about the fact that the analysis of photon statistics for\nsolutions of NLS equation by the use of quantum field theories becomes extremely\ncomplicated. We have simplified such analysis by using certain analogies between the\nclassical and QM solutions and have obtained two important QM new results: 1) The\nphoton number distribution in the one-soliton state is approximately that of a coherent\nstate. (Also in [8,21] the photon number uncertainty has been found to be that of a Poisson\ndistribution). By repeating many times the preparation of the one-soliton under the same\nconditions and measuring in each time the total photon number such distribution might be\nobserved. 2) The present analysis shows that there are Kerr phases which are proportional\nto the one-soliton photon numbers and to the normalization constant A2 . Such phases\nmight be observed by interference experiments [18-20,22].\n\n\f4. Integrability condition for nonlinear equations applied to NLS equation\nThere is a lot of literature in which soliton solutions of nonlinear equations have been\ndeveloped using the inverse scattering methods [1]. In particular Zakharov and Shabat [2]\nhave developed such methods for treating the NLS equation. Our interest in the present\nSection is, however, only to show that the integrability of NLS equation can be related to\nthe compatibility-condition between Hamiltonian and Momentum matrices. We limit the\ndiscussion to the integrability problem and we do not discuss scattering theories which are\nmainly classical as our interest in the present analysis is to analyze quantum effects which\nwill be related to Quantum Optics methods.\nSuppose that u ( z , t ) satisfies some nonlinear evolution equation of the form\n#u( z, t )\n#t\n\nN (u ( z , t ))\n\n(37)\n\nwhere N (u( z , t )) is a nonlinear operator which is independent of t but involves z and\nderivatives relative to z . In particular we relate the analysis in the present Section to\nsolution for the one-soliton state of NLS equation which has been presented in many\nworks. For example such solution has been given by Zakharov and Shabat ([2] Eq. (6)) as:\nexp\nu( z, t )\n\nA0\n\n4i & 2 ( 2 t\n\ncosh 2( x\n\nx0\n\n2i& x i)\n\n,\n\n8(& t\n\n(38)\n\nwhere A0 is a normalization constant. This solution is characterized by 4 constants\n\n( , & , x 0 and ) . By assuming in Eq. (38) &\n\nx0\n\n)\n\n0 and 2( *\n\n1\n\n&\n\nthis equation has\n\nbeen reduced in the previous Section to Eq.(26) with the constraint of Eq. (27) (assuming\nC\n\n2 ). Of course, our previous classical solution can be generalized if we relax the above\n\nspecial conditions.\nLet us assume that we have a two dimensional wavefunction depending both on z\nand t\n\n\f+ ( z, t )\n\n+ 1 ( z, t )\n+ 2 ( z, t )\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\n,\n\n(40)\n\nSuppose that + ( z, t ) satisfy the equation :\n\n# + 1 ( z, t )\n#t + 2 ( z, t )\n\n+ 1 ( z, t )\n+ 2 ( z, t )\n\n,\n\nwhere , is a two dimensional matrix which can include a function of u ( z , t ) and its\nderivatives. Suppose also that + ( z, t ) satify the equation\n\n# + 1 ( z, t )\n#z + 2 ( z, t )\n\n-\n\n+ 1 ( z, t )\n+ 2 ( z, t )\n\n,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere - is a two dimensional matrix which also can include a function of u ( z , t ) and its\nderivatives. We assume the Compatibility-Condition\n# #\n+ ( z, t )\n#z #t\n\n# #\n+ ( z, t )\n#t #z\n\n,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere on the left side of this equation we perform first the derivative of + ( z , t ) first\naccording to t and afterwards according to z while on the right side we inverse the order\nof these derivatives. Using Eqs, (40-41) we get\n# #\n+ ( z, t )\n#z #t\n\n#\n,+ ( z , t )\n#z\n\n#\n,\n#z\n\n,- + ( z , t )\n\n,\n\n(43)\n\n# #\n+ ( z, t )\n#t #z\n\n#\n-+ ( z , t )\n#t\n\n#\nM\n#t\n\n-, + ( z , t )\n\n.\n\n(44)\n\nSubstituting Eqs. (43-44) into Eq. (42) we get the Compatibility Condition\n,-\n\n-,\n\n#\n#t\n\n#\n,\n#z\n\n0\n\n(45)\n\nThe matrix operators - and , are known as Lax pairs [24]. The idea is that by using\nspecial forms for the matrices - and , which satisfy the compatibility equation (45)\n\n\fthey lead to integrable nonlinear equation. We demonstrate here such an approach for the\nNLS equation. For this purpose we define, for example:\n\n-\n\ni.\n\nu( z, t )\n\nu$ ( z, t )\n\ni.\n\ni u( z, t )\n,\n\n2\n\ndu $ ( z , t )\ni\ndz\n\n,\n\n(46)\n\n2i. 2\n\ni\n\n$\n\n2u ( z , t ).\n\ndu ( z, t )\ndz\n\ni u( z, t )\n\n2\n\n2u ( z, t ).\n(47)\n2i.\n\n2\n\nwhere . is a real parameter independent of time t and space z.\nSubstituting Eqs (46) and (47) in the compatibility equation (45) we get after\nstraightforward calculations\n#u\n#t\n\n0\n#u $\n#t\n\n# 2u\ni 2\n#z\n\n2\n\n2i u u\n\ni\n\n$\n\n# 2u\n#z 2\n\n2\n\n2i u u\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n.\n\n(48)\n\nWhile the diagonal elements in the compatibility equation vanish in a trivial way the\nvanishing of the nondiagonal elements lead to NLS equation (up to some normalization\nconstants):\n#u( z, t )\n#t\n\ni\n\n# 2 u( z, t )\n#z 2\n\n2\n\n2i u( z, t ) u ( z, t )\n\n0\n\n,\n\n(49)\n\nand to the complex conjugate of this equation. It is quite interesting to note that while Eqs.\n(40) and (41) depend on the parameter . included in Eqs. (46) and (47), the compatibilitycondition leads to the NLS equations in Eq. (48) which are independent of this parameter.\nEqs. (40) and (41) have a simple geometric interpretation as these equations\ndescribe connections on a two-dimensional vector bundle over the z, t plane [25]. Eq.\n(41) describes how to 'parallel translate' the vector + ( z , t ) in the z -direction and Eq. (40)\n\n\fdescribes how to 'parallel translate' + ( z , t ) in the t -direction. The matrices - and , are\nthe 'connection coefficients'. A connection is defined to have a zero curvature if parallel\ntranslation between two nearby points is independent of the path connecting the two points.\nTherefore the compatibility-condition\n\nrepresents the zero curvature condition for the\n\nintegrability of the nonlinear equation. We have shown that there is a two dimensional\nwavefunction + ( z , t ) satisfying both Eqs. (40) and (41) with the compatibility-condition\nwhich is reduced to the NLS equation.\nOne should notice that Eq. (40) can be changed into\n\ni\n\n# + 1 ( z, t )\n#t + 2 ( z, t )\n\ni,\n\n+ 1 ( z, t )\n+ 2 ( z, t )\n\n,\n\n(50)\n\nwhere i , becomes Hermitian so that Eq. (50) gets the form of Schrodinger equation (with\n1 ). In the same way Eq. (41) can be changed into the form\n\ni\n\nwhere\n\n# + 1 ( z, t )\n#z + 2 ( z, t )\n\niM\n\n+ 1 ( z, t )\n+ 2 ( z, t )\n\n,\n\n(51)\n\niM becomes Hermitian so that Eq. (51) gets the form of the propagation\n\nmomentum matrix [12-17] (with\n\n1) .\n\nEq. (51) leads to Hilbert space with a quantum basis of two orthonormal\nwavefunctions with inner products. Such basis of wavefunctions can be used for giving the\ninitial state where its time dependence will be given by Eq. (50). However, in Eqs. (46) and\n(47) we have assumed that we have already the solution of u ( z , t ) . The inverse scattering\ntheories go in inverse direction where by using quite complicated methods one finds the\nsoliton solution from scattering matrices. We have given the analysis in the present Section\nonly for clarifying the integrability of the nonlinear equation which is obtained by a\nsoliton.\n\n\fWe do not develop scattering equations (see e.g. [1-2, 6-7]) and their relations to\nsolitons as such theories are usually classical and our aim in the present study is to treat\nQM effects. For analyzing Kerr phases effects it will be more efficient to remain with the\nuse of the coupled Hamiltonian-Momentum operator as has been developed in Section 3.\nThe discussion given in the present Section, however, illuminates some important\nproperties about the integrability of the NLS equation.\n\n5. Summary and conclusions\nIn the present study we have analyzed classical and QM effects for electromagnetic (EM)\nwaves which satisfy the one-soliton non-linear Schrodinger (NLS) equation in a dispersive\nwave guide using quantum optics methods. We have treated one mode of the EM field\nwhich includes a coupling between momentum and frequencies due to dispersion relation.\nFor this purpose a coupled Hamiltonian-Momentum operator with equal-space\ncommutation relations (CR) has been used. While most theories about solitons are purely\nclassical [1-2,6-7,10-11] the present treatment of the one-soliton state includes QM effects\nwhich are developed in analogy with the classical theory. It has been shown that by the\nKerr interaction in the soliton, a coherent photon number distribution is obtained with\ncorresponding Kerr quantum phases. The present analysis is different from that of quantum\nfield theories [4-5,9] and from that of other QM theories on solitons [8,21] as it is more\ndirectly related to quantum optics theories of Kerr interactions in other systems [16-20].\nWe have analyzed the relation between the integrability of nonlinear equations and\nthe compatibility-condition for two equations where one of these equations is related to\nHamiltonian and the other to Momentum matrices. It has been shown that by choosing\nspecial equations the compatibility-condition leads to NLS equation and we have discussed\nthe integrability condition for this equation.\n\n\fReferences\n1. M.J.
