As for the\ndark radiation, its effect is constrained by the nucleosynthesis. It is also diluted away in the inflationary era.\nHence, the important change in scalar field dynamics,\nwhich we are going to discuss, may be due to the appearance of the term of quadratic energy density .\nThe purpose of the present paper is to study dynamics of a scalar field confined on the brane, taking into\naccount the effect of the quadratic-energy-density term.\nWe discuss three typical potentials appeared in many cosmological implications; a power-law potential, an inversepower-law potential, and an exponential potential. The\nanalysis of the quintessential potential will complete our\nprevious discussion [15,16].\nIn Sec. II, we present the basic equations assuming the\nRandall-Sundrum's second model. Next, in Sec. III, we\nshow cosmological solutions in both scalar-field dominant\nand radiation dominant eras. These solutions are found\nanalytically by using some approximations.\nIn Sec. IV, we first study linear perturbations of the\nsolutions, and then in Sec. V, we analyze those global\nstability. Sec. VI is devoted to summary and discussion.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nA scalar field has played a very important role in cosmology. The problems of the standard Big-Bang theory,\nsuch as the horizon, and flatness problems could be resolved by the inflationary scenario [1]. In this scenario,\nthe universe expands quasi-exponentially because of the\nvacuum energy, whose origin in many models are given\nby a scalar field (inflaton). Among inflationary scenarios,\nthe chaotic inflation, which has a power-law type potential (V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c6n : n is an integer) is the simplest model.\nAnother example in which, a scalar field plays an important role is a cosmological phase transition and formation of topological defects [2]. The observed dark energy\ncould be also explained by a scalar field whose energy\ndensity decreases in time (quintessence) [3,4]. In a typical quintessence model, the potential of the scalar field\nis assumed to be an inverse-power-law (V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 :\n[\u03b1 > 0]). An exponential-type (V (\u03c6) \u223c exp[\u2212\u03bb\u03c6]) is naturally expected in many supergravity theories [5]. Hence\nthose scalar fields are extensively studied by many authors in the conventional Einstein gravity theory. However, recent higher dimensional unification scenario based\non a brane world suggests that the gravitational law could\nbe different from the Einstein's one at the early stage of\nthe universe or at high-energy scale.\nIn the brane-world scenario, which is based on a superstring or M-theory, our universe is embedded in higher dimensions. Standard-model particles are confined in this\nfour-dimensional hypersurfaces (3-branes), while gravity propagates in a higher-dimensional bulk space [6\u20139].\nAmong them, the Randall-Sundrum's second model is\nvery interesting because it provides a new type of compactification of gravity. Assuming a 3-brane with a positive tension is embedded in 5-dimensional anti de-Sitter\nbulk spacetime, the conventional four-dimensional gravity theory is recovered in low energy limit, even though\nthe extra dimension is not compact [9]. While, at high en-\n\nII. BASIC EQUATIONS\n\nWe analyze dynamics of a scalar field in the RandallSundrum's second brane scenario [9], because the model\nis simple and concrete. It is, however, worthwhile not1\n\n\fdynamical equation for a scalar field as a conventional\none, i.e.\n\ning that the present result may be also valid in other\ntypes of brane world models, in which a quadratic term\nof energy-momentum tensor generically appears. In the\nbrane world, all matter fields and forces except gravity\nare confined on the 3-brane in a 5-dimensional spacetime.\nThe extra-dimension is not compactified, but gravity is\nconfined in the brane, resulting in the Newtonian gravity\nin our world. Since the gravity is confined in the brane, it\nis described by the intrinsic metric of the 4-dimensional\nbrane spacetime. By use of Israel's junction condition\nand assuming Z2 symmetry, the gravitational equations\non the 3-brane is given by [10]\n(4)\n\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212(4) \u039bg\u03bc\u03bd + \u03ba24 T\u03bc\u03bd + \u03ba45 \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 +\n\ndV\n= 0,\nd\u03c6\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere V is a potential of the scalar field. The energy\ndensity of the scalar field is\n\u03c1\u03c6 =\n\n1 2\n\u03c6\u0307 + V (\u03c6).\n2\n\n(2.5)\n\nFor the energy density of radiation fluid, we have\n\u03c1 \u0307r + 4H\u03c1r = 0,\n\n(2.1)\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhich is integrated as \u03c1r \u221d a\u22124 .\nAs the Universe expands, the energy density decreases.\nThis means that the quadratic term was very important\nin the early stage of the Universe. Comparing two terms\n(the conventional energy density term and the quadratic\none), we find that the quadratic term dominates when\n\nwhere (4) G\u03bc\u03bd is the Einstein tensor with respect to the\nintrinsic metric g\u03bc\u03bd , (4) \u039b is the F 4-dimensional cosmological constant, T\u03bc\u03bd represents the energy-momentum\ntensor of matter fields confined on the brane and \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd\nis defined by its quadratic form. E\u03bc\u03bd is a part of the\n5-dimensional Weyl tensor and carries some information\nabout a bulk geometry. \u03ba42 = 8\u03c0G4 and \u03ba52 = 8\u03c0G5 are\n4-dimensional and 5-dimensional gravitational constants,\nrespectively. In what follows, we use the 4-dimensional\nPlanck mass m4 \u2261 \u03ba4\u22121 = (2.4 \u00d7 1018 GeV) and the 5\u22122/3\ndimensional Planck mass m5 \u2261 \u03ba5\n, which could be\nmuch smaller than m4 .\nAssuming the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime\nin our brane world, we find the effective Friedmann equations from Eq.(2.1) as\n\n\u03c1 > \u03c1c \u2261 12m56 /m42 .\n\n(2.7)\n\nWhen the quadratic term is dominant, the expansion\nlaw of the Universe is modified. For example, the expansion law in radiation dominant era is a \u221d t1/4 instead\nof the conventional one t1/2 . Since we know the behavior of the scalar field in the linear term dominant stage,\nwhich is the conventional cosmological model, in this paper we study the behavior of the scalar field only in the\nquadratic term dominant stage.\nThe nucleosynthesis gives a constraint on fundamental constants, if the quadratic-energy-density dominant\nstage exists. The nucleosynthesis must take place in\nthe conventional radiation dominant era to explain the\namount of light elements. Hence, assuming that the\nenergy density at a = ac is dominated by radiation\nas \u03c1c \u223c (\u03c0 2 /30)gTc4, where g is the degree of freedom of particles, the temperature of the universe Tc\nmust be higher than that of nucleosynthesis, i.e. T c >\nTN S \u223c 1MeV.

C is a constant, which term describes\n\"dark\" radiation coming from E\u03bc\u03bd [12]. In what follows,\nwe consider only the flat Friedmann model (k = 0) and\nassume that (4) \u039b vanishes for simplicity.\nAs for matter fields on the brane, we consider a scalar\nfield \u03c6 as well as the conventional radiation fluid, i.e.\n\u03c1 = \u03c1\u03c6 + \u03c1r , where \u03c1\u03c6 , and \u03c1r are the energy densities\nof scalar field \u03c6, and of radiation fluid. We consider only\nthe early stage of the universe, at which the quadratic\nterm is dominant and then matter fluid can be ignored.\nAlthough a 5-dimensional scalar field living in the bulk\n[19] may also appear in a brane world scenario, in this paper we only consider a 4-dimensional scalar field confined\non the brane. The origin of such a scalar field might be\nfound as a result of condensation of matter fields confined\non the brane such as fermions.\nSince the energy and momentum of each field on the\nbrane are conserved in the present model, we find the\n\nIII. COSMOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS\n\nThere are two interesting limiting cases: one is the\nscalar-field dominant era and the other is the radiation\ndominant era. We discuss those solutions separately.\nA. Solutions in scalar-field dominant era\n\nAssuming the scalar field dominance, we find the Friedmann equation (2.2) as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1 2\nH=\n\u03c6\u0307 + V (\u03c6) .\n(3.1)\n6m53 2\n2\n\n\f\u03c1\u03c6 \u221d t\u22121 \u221d a\u22121/p .\n\nWe consider the following three types of the potential:\nV (\u03c6) = \u03bc\u03b1+4 \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 , \u03bc4 exp[\u2212\u03bb m\u03c64 ] and 21 m2 \u03c62 , ( 14 \u03bb\u03c64 ) in\norder.\n\nIf p > 1, i.e. \u03bc > 401/6 m5 \u2248 1.85m5 , we have a powerlaw inflationary solution [20], which is an attractor of the\npresent system as we will see later. While, if p < 1/4,\ni.e. \u03bc < 41/6 m5 \u2248 1.26m5, this solution is no longer an\nattractor, leading to the radiation dominant era (see Sec.\nIV).\nIf \u03b1 > 2, a kinetic-term dominant solution gives the\nasymptotic behavior of the present system (see Sec.

Then before reaching t0\n, the potential term becomes dominant. However, since\nthe potential-dominant solution is not any attractor, it\nturns out that the former kinetic-dominant solution is\neventually reached (see Sec. IV). Consequently, the\nkinetic-term dominance is the asymptotic behavior for\n\u03b1 > 2. This guarantees the radiation, if it exists, eventually dominates the scalar-field, which makes initial conditions for a successful quintessence wider [15,16].\n\nwhere a constant H0 is given by\n\n\u0012\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere t0 and \u03c60 are integration constants.

If we estimate the eigenvalues for the asymptotic equations, we find that those are -1/2 and -1, which\nsuggests the system is stable. However, since the equations have explicit time-dependence, we have to be careful to conclude it Fortunately, in this case, we can easily\nintegrate the above perturbed equations directly as\n\u03c4\n\u03b1V0\n\u03b4V = \u03b4V0 e\u2212 2 + \u221a \u03b4P0 e\u2212\u03c4\n2\n\u03b1\u22122\n\u03b1(\u03b1 \u2212 2)\n\u2212\nV02 e\u2212 2 \u03c4\n2(\u03b1 \u2212 3)(\u03b1 \u2212 4)\n\u03b1\u22122\n(\u03b1 \u2212 2)\n\u03b4P = \u03b4P0 e\u2212\u03c4 \u2212 \u221a\nV0 e \u2212 2 \u03c4 ,\n2(\u03b1 \u2212 4)\n\n(4.30)\n\n1\n\u03b4F \u2032 = \u2212 \u03b4F + \u03b4P,\n2\n\u03b4P \u2032 = \u2212\u03b4P\n\nfor \u03b1 = 4, where \u03b4V0 and \u03b4P0 are the integration constants. These show that \u03b4V, \u03b4P \u2192 0 in the limit of \u03c4 \u2192\n\u221e, which means that the kinetic dominant solution is\nstable against linear perturbations for V (\u03c6) = \u03bc4+\u03b1 \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 ,\nwith \u03b1 > 2. Note that for the case of 2 < \u03b1 < 3, the\nperturbations drop more slowly than those expected just\nfrom the above eigenvalues.\nNext, we consider the case with an exponential potential V = \u03bc4 e\u2212\u03bb\u03c6/m5 . The asymptotic behavior of the\nsolution is\n\n(4.40)\n(4.41)\n\nThe eigenvalues of the system (4.40), (4.41) are -1/2 and\n-1, then the kinetic dominant solution is stable against\nlinear perturbations for V (\u03c6) = \u03bc4 e\u2212\u03bb\u03c6/m5 as well. We\ncan easily check that it is correct even including the timedependent terms.\n\n7\n\n\fIf we adopt a naive analysis for the asymptotic equations ignoring decaying time-dependent terms, we find\nthat the eigen values are \u2212V0 /(2 \u2212 \u03b1) and 0. The zero\neigenvalue corresponds to a marginally unstable mode,\nwhich appears in a slow-rolling phase of an inflationary\nsolution.\nIn order to confirm the asymptotic behaviors of \u03b4V and\n\u03b4P, we will integrate the above equations directly. To\nsolve (4.52) and (4.53), we first need to find the following\nfirst-order differential equation\n\n3. the inflationary solution\n\nFinally, we study a stability about the inflationary solution (3.4) with the inverse-power-law potential V =\n\u03bc\u03b1+4 \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 (\u03b1 < 2).

Since this is an attractor, such a solution is eventually obtained even though\nfrom the radiation-dominant initial condition. The inflationary solutions in these models are milder than that in\nthe conventional cosmology. Because this potential has\nno minima, in order to recover the Big-Bang cosmology,\nsome unknown reheating mechanisms is required . The\ngravitational particle production could provide its resolution [23].\n\u221a\n\u221a\nFor V = \u03bc6 \u03c6\u22122 with 6 4 m5 < \u03bc < 6 40 m5 , we\nfind one critical solution, i.e. a \u223c tp , with p = [1 +\n1/8(\u03bc/m5)6 ]/6. The power p is in the range\n\u221aof 1/4 < p <\n1. This solution is the attractor for \u03bc > 6 4 m5\u221a\n, which\ngives \u03a9\u03c6 = 1 and 1/4 < p < 1. While for \u03bc < 6 4 m5 ,\nanother critical point with p = 1/4 appears, which turns\nto be the attractor. For this scaling solution, \u03a9\u03c6 depends\non \u03bc (\u03a9\u03c6 = 21 ( m\u03bc5 )3 ), and the small value of \u03bc (\u03bc <\n\u221a\n6\n4 m5 ), the energy density of radiation in this attractor\nuniverse exceeds that of the scalar field.\nFor V = \u03bc4+\u03b1 \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 , with 2 < \u03b1 < 6, which we discussed in the previous paper for the quintessence scenario [15,16], the attractor universe is radiation dominant and the power-law solution is the attractor for the\nscalar field. Our work concerned to quintessence for this\nmodel is completed in this paper to show the stability of\nthe solutions. (For the naturalness of the quintessence\nscenario and the constraints to this model, see [15,16].).\nFor V = \u03bc4+\u03b1 \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 , with 6 < \u03b1 and V = e\u2212\u03bb\u03c6/m5 ,\nbecause the shape of the potential is too steep, the kinetic\nterm of the scalar field dominates the potential term both\nin the scalar field dominant universe and the radiation\ndominant universe asymptotically.\nIn this paper, we have assumed that a scalar field is\nconfined in the brane. However, most models based on\na string theory require a dilaton field in the bulk, which\nmay gives very important effects on the behavior of gravity and a scalar field on the brane [19]. The analysis in\nsuch models is left to the future work.\n\nVI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have studied the dynamics of a scalar\nfield with the typical potential in a brane world scenario.\nWe have adopted the second Randall-Sundrum brane scenario and assumed that the scalar field is confined on our\n4-dimensional spacetime. In this model, because of the\nquadratic term of the energy density, which is from the\nconsequence of our brane embedded in the extra dimension, the dynamics of the scalar field is modified from a\nconventional cosmology in the early stage of the universe.\nFor the power-law potential model, which was discussed in [22], there exist an inflationary solution in\nthe quadratic term dominant stage, which satisfies slowrolling condition. Similar to the conventional cosmology,\nthe e-folding number more than 60 is obtained for sufficiently large initial values of \u03c6. However, because the\ncosmic expansion is faster than that in the conventional\ncosmology, a shorter time is required for the enough efolding number.\nAfter the slow-rolling condition is broken, and the oscillating phase starts, the dynamics of the scalar field depends on the power of the scalar field potential. For the\nmodel, V (\u03c6) = 21 m2 \u03c62 , the energy density of the scalar\nfield decreases as the pressureless perfect fluid and more\nslowly than that in the conventional case. In the preheating stage, this changes the time dependence of the\nvariable appeared in the Mathieu equation and leads to\nan efficient particle production via non-perturbative decay of inflaton even for the smaller coupling constant. For\nthe model, V (\u03c6) = 14 \u03bb\u03c64 , the energy density of the scalar\nfield decreases as the radiation fluid. In this case, the solution of the scalar field evolution is represented in terms\nof the elliptic function and the form of the Lam\u00e9 equation in the preheating stage is not changed. Although\nthis is the same as the conventional case, because of the\nslower growth of the scale factor, the particle production\nbecomes a little efficient [18].\nFor the models with an inverse-power-law potential\nmodel (V = \u03bc4+\u03b1 \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 ) or an exponential potential model\nV = \u03bc4 e\u2212\u03bb\u03c6/m5 , we find much difference from conventional cosmology. We find analytic solutions in several\ncircumstances, and analyze those stabilities. According\nto the solutions and those analysis, the aymptotic behavior of the universe is sammarized as follows:\nFor\u221aV = \u03bc4+\u03b1 \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 , with \u03b1 < 2 and with \u03b1 = 2\n(\u03bc > 6 40m5 ), an inflationary solution is obtained in the\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank T.
