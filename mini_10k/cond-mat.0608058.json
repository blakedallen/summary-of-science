I NTRODUCTION\nIt is well known that photonic crystals (PCs) offer unique\nopportunities to control the flow of light [1]. The basic idea\nis to design periodic dielectric structures that have a bandgap\nfor a particular frequency range. Periodic dielectric rods with\nremoved one or several rows of elements can be used as\nwaveguiding devices when operating at bandgap frequencies.\nA lot of effort has been made to obtain a complete and wider\nbandgap. It has been shown that a triangular lattice of air holes\nin a dielectric background has a complete bandgap for TE\n(transverse electric) mode, while a square lattice of dielectric\nrods in air has a bandgap for TM (transverse magnetic)\nmode [2]. The devices operating in the bandgap frequencies\nare not the only option to guide the flow of light. Another\nwaveguiding mechanism is the total internal reflection (TIR)\nin one-dimensional (1-D) periodic dielectric rods [3]. It is\nanalysed in [3] that a single row of dielectric rods or air holes\nsupports waveguiding modes and therefore can be also used as\nwaveguide. In [4], the design of such waveguides consisting\nof several rows of dielectric rods with various spacings is\nproposed.\nRecently, a new method for guiding electromagnetic waves\nin structures whose dimensions are below the diffraction limit\nhas been proposed. The structures are termed as 'plasmonic\nwaveguides' which have an operation of principle based on\nnear-field interactions between closely spaced noble metal\nnanoparticles (spacing \u226a \u03bb) that can be efficiently excited\nat their surface plasmon frequency. The guiding principle\nrelies on coupled plasmon modes set up by near-field dipole\n\ninteractions that lead to coherent propagation of energy along\nthe array. Analogous structures as waveguides in microwave\nregime include periodic metallic cylinders to support propagating waves [5], array of flat dipoles which support guided waves\n[6], and Yagi-Uda antennas [7], [8] etc. However, although\nthese structures can be scaled to optical frequencies with\nappropriate material properties, their dimensions are limited\nby the so-called diffraction limit \u03bb/(2n). On the other hand,\nplasmonic waveguides employ the localisation of electromagnetic fields near metal surfaces to confine and guide light in\nregions much smaller than the free space wavelength and can\neffectively overcome the diffraction limit. Previous analysis of\nplasmonic structures includes the plasmon propagation along\nmetal stripes, wires, or grooves in metal [9]\u2013[14], and the\ncoupling between plasmons on metal particles in order to\nguide energy [15], [16] etc. Such subwavelength structures\ncan also find their applications e.g. efficient absorbers and\nelectrically small receiving antennas at microwave frequencies.\nRecently composite materials containing randomly distributed\nelectrically conductive material and non-electrically conductive material have been designed [17]. They are noted to exhibit plasma-like responses at frequencies well below plasma\nfrequencies of the bulk material.\nThe finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [18]\nis seen as the most popular numerical technique especially\nbecause of its flexibility in handling material dispersion as\nwell as arbitrary shaped inclusions. In [19], the optical pulse\npropagation below the diffraction limit is shown using the\nFDTD method. Also with the FDTD method, the waveguide\nformed by several rows of silver nanorods arranged in hexagonal is studied [20]. Despite these examples of applying the\nFDTD method for the plasmonic structures, the accuracy of\nmodelling has not been proven yet. When modelling curved\nstructures, unless using extremely fine meshes, due to the\nnature of orthogonal and staggered grid of conventional FDTD,\noften modifications need to be applied in order to improve\nthe numerical accuracy, such as the treatment of interfaces\nbetween different materials even for planar structures [21], and\nthe improved conformal algorithms using structured meshes\n[22] for curved surfaces.\nIn addition to the modifications at material interfaces, the\nmaterial frequency dispersion has also to be taken into account\nin FDTD modelling [23]\u2013[25]. However, modelling dispersive\nmaterials with curved surfaces still remains to be a challenging\ntopic due to the complexity in algorithm as well as the introduction of numerical instability. An alternative way to solve\nthis problem is based on the idea of effective permittivities\n(EPs) [26]\u2013[28] in the underlying Cartesian coordinate system,\n\n\f2\n\na)\n\nb)\n\n1\n\nEx\n\n0.8\n\nHz\n\ne1\ne2\n\nEy\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n1-f\n0.2\n0\n\nn\nn\ne1\n\nf\ne2\n\nFig. 1.

The radius of circular cylinder is ten cells.\nFig. 2. Layout of a quarter circular inclusion in orthogonal FDTD grid for\nEy component. The radius of circular cylinder is three cells.\n\nand the dispersive FDTD scheme can be therefore modified\naccordingly without affecting the stability of algorithm. In this\npaper, we first propose a novel conformal dispersive FDTD\nalgorithm combining the EPs together with an auxiliary differential equation (ADE) method [18], then apply the developed\nmethod to the modelling of plasmonic waveguides formed by\nan array of circular or elliptical shaped silver cylinders at\noptical frequencies. Numerical FDTD simulation results are\nverified by a frequency domain embedding method [29]. To\nthe authors' knowledge, it is the first time that a conformal\nscheme is combined with the dispersive FDTD method for\nthe modelling of nano-plasmonic waveguides.\nII. C ONFORMAL D ISPERSIVE FDTD M ETHOD U SING\nE FFECTIVE P ERMITTIVITIES\nConventionally, staircase approximations are often used to\nmodel curved electromagnetic structures in an orthogonal\nFDTD domain. Figure 1(a) shows an example layout of an\ninfinite-long cylinder in the free space represented in a twodimensional (2-D) orthogonal FDTD domain. The approximated shape introduces spurious numerical resonant modes\nwhich do not exist in actual structures. On the other hand,\nusing the concept of filling ratio, which is defined as the ratio\nof the area of material \u03b52 to the area of a particular FDTD cell,\nthe curvature can be properly represented in FDTD domain\nas shown in Fig. 1(b), where different levels of darkness\nindicate different filling ratios of material \u03b52 . The accuracy\nof modelling can be significantly improved compared with\nstaircase approximations, as will be shown in a later section.\nAccording to [28], the EP in a general form is given by\n\u03b5eff = \u03b5k (1 \u2212 n2 ) + \u03b5\u22a5 n2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n is the projection of the unit normal vector n along\nthe field component as shown in Fig. 2, \u03b5k and \u03b5\u22a5 are parallel and perpendicular permittivities to the material interface,\nrespectively and defined as\n\u03b5k\n\u03b5\u22a5\n\n= f \u03b52 + (1 \u2212 f )\u03b51 ,\n\n(2)\n\u22121\n\n= [f /\u03b52 + (1 \u2212 f )/\u03b51 ]\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere f is the filling ratio of material \u03b52 in a certain FDTD\ncell.\nIn this paper we consider the inclusions as silver cylinders,\nwhich at optical frequencies can be modelled using the Drude\n\ndispersion model\n\u03b52 (\u03c9) = \u03b50\n\n\u03c9p2\n1\u2212 2\n\u03c9 \u2212 j\u03c9\u03b3\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c9p is the plasma frequency and \u03b3 is the collision\nfrequency. At the frequencies below the plasma frequency,\nthe real part of permittivity is negative. In this paper, we\nassume that the silver cylinders are embedded in the free space\n(\u03b51 = \u03b50 ).\nIn order to take into account the frequency dispersion of the\nmaterial, the electric flux density D is introduced into standard\nFDTD updating equations. At each time step, D is updated\ndirectly from H and E can be calculated from D through the\nfollowing steps.

FDTD C ALCULATION OF D ISPERSION D IAGRAM\nApplying the Bloch's periodic boundary conditions (PBCs)\n[31]\u2013[36], FDTD method can be used to model periodic\nstructures and calculate their dispersion diagrams [37], [38].\nFor any periodic structures, the field at any time should satisfy\nthe Bloch theory, i.e.\nE(d + a) = E(d)ejka ,\n\nH(d + a) = H(d)ejka ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere d is the distance vector of any location in the computation domain, k is the wave vector and a is the lattice\nvector along the direction of periodicity. When updating the\nfields at the boundary of the computation domain using FDTD,\nthe required fields outside the computation domain can be\ncalculated using known field values inside the domain through\nEq. (13). Although instead of using real values in conventional\nFDTD computations, the calculation of dispersion diagrams\nrequires complex field values, since only one unit cell is\nmodelled, the computation load is not significantly increased.\nFirst we apply the developed conformal dispersive FDTD\nmethod to calculate the dispersion diagram for 1-D plasmonic\nwaveguides formed by an array of periodic infinite-long (along\nz-direction) circular silver cylinders. As shown in Fig. 3,\nthe 2-D simulation domain (x-y) with TE modes (therefore\nonly Ex , Ey and Hz are non-zero fields) is truncated using\nBloch's PBCs in x-direction and Berenger's perfectly matched\nlayers (PMLs) [39] in y-direction. The Berenger's PMLs have\nexcellent performance for absorbing propagating waves [39],\n\n\f4\n\nx\n\n1.4\nFDTD with staircase (Dx = 2.5\u00d710-9m)\nFDTD with staircase (Dx = 1.25\u00d710-9m)\nFDTD with EP (Dx = 2.5\u00d710-9m)\nEmbedding\n\nBloch periodic boundary condition\n\nr\na\n\nsilver cylinder\n\nNormalised intensity (a. u.)\n\nfree space\n\nperfectly matched layer\n\nperfectly matched layer\n\n1.2\n\ny\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nBloch periodic boundary condition\nFig. 3. The layout of the 2-D FDTD computation domain for calculating\ndispersion diagram for 1-D periodic structures. The inclusion has a circular\ncross-section with radius r and the period of the 1-D infinite structure is a.\n\nhowever for evanescent waves, field shows growing behaviour\ninside PMLs. Since the waves radiated by point or line sources\nconsist of both propagating and evanescent components, extra\nspace (typically a quarter wavelength at the frequency of\ninterest) between PMLs and the circular inclusion is added\nto allow the evanescent waves to decay before reaching the\nPMLs.\nThe radius of silver cylinders is r = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22128 m and\nthe period is a = 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22128 m. The plasma and collision\nfrequencies are \u03c9p = 9.39 \u00d7 1015 rad/s and \u03b3 = 3.14 \u00d7 1013\nHz, respectively in order to closely match the bulk dielectric\nfunction of silver [40]. The FDTD cell size \u221a\nis \u2206x = \u2206y =\n2.5 \u00d7 10\u22129 m with the time step \u2206t = \u2206x/( 2c) s (where c\nis the speed of light in the free space) according to the Courant\nstability criterion [18]. Although the stability condition for\nhigh-order FDTD method is typically more strict than the\nconventional one, since the average operator \u03bct is applied to\ndevelop the algorithm, we have not found any instability for\na complete time period of more than 40,000 time steps used\nin all simulations.\nA wideband magnetic line source is placed at an arbitrary\nlocation in the free space region of the 2-D simulation domain\nin order to excite all resonant modes of the structure within\nthe frequency range of interest (normalised frequency f =\n\u03c9a/(2\u03c0c) \u2208 [0 \u223c 0.5]):\ng(t) = e\u2212(\n\nt\u2212t0\n\u03c4\n\n2\n\n) * ej\u03c9t\n\n(14)\n\nwhere t0 is the initial time delay, \u03c4 defines the pulse width\nand \u03c9 is the centre frequency of the pulse (f = 0.25). The\nmagnetic fields at one hundred random locations in the free\nspace region are recorded during simulations, transformed\ninto the frequency domain and combined to extract individual\nresonant mode corresponding to each local maximum. For\neach wave vector, a total number of 40,000 time steps are\nused in our simulations to obtain enough accurate frequency\ndomain results.\nIn order to demonstrate the advantage of EPs and validate\nthe proposed conformal dispersive FDTD method, we have\n\n0\n0.19 0.195\n\n0.2\n\n0.205 0.21 0.215 0.22 0.225 0.23\nFrequency (\u03c9a/2\u03c0c)\n\nFig. 4. Comparison of the first resonant frequency (transverse mode) at\nwave vector kx = \u03c0/a calculated using the FDTD method with staircase\napproximations, the FDTD method with EPs and the frequency domain\nembedding method.\n\nalso performed simulations using staircase approximations for\nthe circular cylinder, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Figure 4 shows the\ncomparison of the first resonant frequency (transverse mode) at\nwave vector kx = \u03c0/a of the plasmonic waveguide calculated\nusing the FDTD method with staircase approximations, the\nFDTD method with EPs and the frequency domain embedding method [41]. With the same FDTD spatial resolutions,\nthe model using EP shows excellent agreement with the\nresults from the frequency domain embedding method, on\nthe contrary, the staircase approximation not only leads to\na shift of the main resonant frequency, but also introduces\na spurious numerical resonant mode which does not exist in\nactual structures. The same effect has also been found for nondispersive dielectric cylinders [42]. It is also shown in Fig. 4\nthat although one may correct the main resonant frequency\nusing finer meshes, the spurious resonant mode still remains.\nThe problem of frequency shift and spurious modes become\nseverer when calculating higher guided modes near the 'flat\nband' region (i.e the region where waves travel at a very low\nphase velocity). Even with a refined spatial resolution, the\nstaircase approximation fails to provide correct results (not\nshown). On the other hand, using the proposed conformal\ndispersive FDTD scheme, all resonant modes are correctly\ncaptured in FDTD simulations as demonstrated by the comparison with the embedding method as shown in Fig. 5.\nAccording to previous analysis using the frequency embedding method, the fundamental mode in the modelled plasmonic\nwaveguide is transverse mode and the second guided mode is\nlongitudinal [41], which is also shown by the distribution of\nelectric field intensities in Fig. 6 from our FDTD simulations.\nThe higher guided modes are referred to as plasmon modes.\nFor demonstration of field symmetries and due to the TE mode\nconsidered in our simulations, we have plotted the distributions\nof magnetic field corresponding to different resonant modes\nat wave number kx = \u03c0/a as marked in Fig. 5, as shown\nin Fig. 7.

The modes (a), (c) and (d) in Fig. 7 are even\nmodes (relative to the direction of periodicity of the waveguide\ni.e. x-axis), and (b) and (e) are considered as odd modes.\nThe above comparison of the simulation results calculated\nusing the conformal dispersive FDTD method and the embedding method clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of applying\nthe EPs in FDTD modelling. Furthermore, in contrast to the\nembedding method, the main advantage of the FDTD method\nis that arbitrary shaped geometries can be easily modelled. We\nhave applied the conformal dispersive FDTD method to study\nthe effect of different inclusions on the dispersion diagrams\nof 1-D plasmonic waveguides. The geometries considered are\ntwo rows of periodic infinite-long (along z-direction) circular\nsilver cylinders arranged in square lattice and a single row\nof periodic infinite-long (along z-direction) elliptical silver\ncylinders. The elliptical element has a ratio of semimajor-tosemiminor axis 2:1, where the semiminor axis is equal to the\nradius of the circular element (25.0 nm). For the two rows\nof circular nanorods, the spacing between two rows (centreto-centre distance) is 75.0 nm. The dispersion diagrams for\nthese structures are plotted in Figs. 8 and 10. Comparing the\ndispersion diagrams for a single circular element in Fig. 5 and\ntwo circular elements in Fig. 8 we can see that the dispersion\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\nWave vector (2\u03c0/a)\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nFig. 8.

The\nstrong coupling between two elements introduces additional\nguided modes to appear in dispersion diagram. Such phenomenon has also been studied for dielectric (non-dispersive)\nnanorods previously [4]. The distributions of magnetic field\nfor selected guided modes as marked in Fig. 8 are plotted in\nFig. 9. The modes (a), (c) and (d) are even modes while (b)\nand (e) are odd modes.\nThe dispersion diagram for a single elliptical element as\ninclusion is shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that more guided\nmodes appear which is caused by the change of inclusion's\ngeometrical shape from circular to elliptical. The frequency\ncorresponding to the lowest mode has been lowered due to the\nincrease of inclusion's volume. The distributions of magnetic\nfield for selected guided modes are plotted in Fig. 11. The\nmodes (a) and (d) are even modes and (b), (c) and (e) are odd\nmodes, respectively.\nIV.

Dispersion diagram for a single row of periodic infinite-long (along\nz-direction) elliptical silver cylinders calculated from conformal dispersive\nFDTD simulations.\n\nreplaced PBCs in x-direction with PMLs and added additional\ncells for the free space region to the simulation domain.\nThe number of nanorods under study is seven. The spacing\n(pseudo-period) between adjacent elements remains the same\nas for infinite structures considered in the previous section. For\na single mode excitation, we choose the frequency of corresponding mode from dispersion diagram, and excite sinusoidal\nsources at different locations with respect to the symmetry of\ndifferent guided modes at one end of the waveguides.\nFor the plasmonic waveguides formed by different types\nof inclusions, we have chosen certain eigen modes: mode\nFig. 7(a) for a single row of circular cylinders, mode Fig. 9(d)\nfor two rows of circular cylinders, and mode Fig. 11(e) for a\nsingle row of elliptical cylinders. The distributions of magnetic\nfield intensity for different waveguides operating in these\nguided modes are plotted in Fig. 12. The field plots are taken\nafter the steady state is reached in simulations. It is clearly seen\nthat single guided modes are coupled into these waveguides\nbut the excitation of certain modes highly depends on the\nsymmetry of field patterns.

C ONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have developed a conformal dispersive\nFDTD method for the modelling of plasmonic waveguides\nformed by an array of periodic infinite-long silver cylinders\nat optical frequencies. The conformal scheme is based on effective permittivities and its main advantage is that since conventional orthogonal FDTD grid is maintained in simulations,\nno numerical instability is introduced. The material frequency\ndispersion is taken into account using an auxiliary differential\nequation method. The comparison of dispersion diagrams\nfor one-dimensional periodic silver cylinders calculated using\nthe conformal dispersive FDTD method, the conventional\n\n\f7\n\ndispersive FDTD method with staircase approximations and\nthe frequency domain embedding method demonstrates the\naccuracy of the proposed method. It is shown that by adding\nadditional element or changing the geometry of inclusions, the\ncorresponding dispersion diagram can be modified. Numerical\nsimulations of plasmonic waveguides formed by seven elements show that the eigen modes in infinite structures can be\nexcited but highly depend on the symmetry of field patterns\nof certain modes. Further work includes the investigation\nof the effects of different number of elements in plasmonic\nwaveguides on guided modes, and the calculation of group\nvelocity of different modes propagating in these waveguides.\nAlthough results presented in this paper have been focused\nat optical frequencies, with future advances in microwave\nplasmonic materials, novel applications can be found in the\ndesigns of small antenna and efficient absorbers.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Mr. N.
