This is in\nspite of numerous statistical and experimental studies that invalidate both the underlying\nassumptions (eg. the rationality of economic participants) of the EMH and the output of\nmathematical models that are derived from them (eg. stock prices that are described by\na geometric Brownian motion resulting in a Gaussian distribution of the changes in the\nlog-price returns) [2, 9]. The near-universal statistical properties of real markets, most of\nwhich deviate from those predicted by the EMH, are often referred to as the 'stylized facts'.\nThe inappropriate use of EMH models and Gaussian statistics by market participants can\ncause great damage, not just to the participants themselves but to entire economies. For\nexample, a widely-used form of portfolio risk management, called Value-at-Risk, attempts to\nestimate the maximum loss that can occur with a specified (low) probability. Also many so\ncalled 'quantitative' hedge-funds use historical correlations between different financial products to identify and exploit perceived market mispricings. This extrapolation from the past\ninto the future becomes less justifiable in an environment where the decreasing probability\nof large fluctuations follows a power-law rather than an exponential one (i.e. where 'fat-tails'\nare present) and significant coupling between market participants can develop.\nTo take a very recent example, at the time of writing a sudden rise in the delinquency\nrates of so-called subprime mortgages in the US has precipitated a credit-crunch in financial\nmarkets around the world. The growth of this industry was stimulated by a period of low\nglobal interest rates, inadequate accounting and credit-rating standards and the development\nof novel financial derivatives such as Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and Credit\nDefault Swaps (CDSs).\nHowever it is the proximal causes that are of more interest us here. The herding phenomenon and the resulting 'madness of crowds' that lies at the heart of most, if not all,\nfinancial bubbles was present in the general public and their increasingly irrational belief\nthat house prices would continue to rapidly climb. This caused a cycle of additional housebuying and home-equity withdrawal that fuelled prices further. However, on the lending\nside of the equation, there were significant perverse incentives and moral hazards at play.\nRealtors, property appraisers and mortgage brokers all receive their commissions at the time\n2\n\n\fof the transaction and have no incentive to question the quality of the transaction or lower\nits amount. The loan originators were similarly able to distance themselves from the default risk on the loans via the use of CDOs and CDSs. This continued up the financial food\nchain, helped by the fact that there was no open market for these derivatives and their prices\ncould be easily manipulated via creative accounting practices. Finally, when the housing\nmarket burst the liquidity assumption inherent in almost all financial models - that any\ndesired transaction can be carried out at the current price - failed to hold as buyers of\nthese derivatives vanished from the marketplace.\nIn short, it is hard to see how models based solely upon the notion of efficient markets\ncan begin to adequately predict or quantify situations such as the one described above. The\nconstruction of financial models that can incoporate both rational and irrational agent behaviour, as well as the rational-but-perverse consequences of market defects, is an important\nundertaking. The simple, yet plausible, class of models introduced in this paper provides\na possible framework within which the consequences of different EMH violations can be\nsystematically studied.\n\nII.\n\nPREVIOUS RESULTS\n\nIn [3, 4, 5, 7] a class of models using thresholds was introduced. These are briefly\ndescribed below but the reader is directed to the references for further details. The models\nconsisted of two parts, one defining the price updates and the other determining when agents\nswitch. The price changes were determined by both external factors, namely a Gaussian\nuncorrelated information stream, and changes in the internal supply/demand due to agents\nswitching positions.\nThe thresholds are involved in the modeling of the agents themselves. In the simplest case,\nwhenever an agent switches position, a pair of fixed price thresholds is generated (from some\npredetermined distribution) that straddles the current price. Then, when the price crosses\neither of the thresholds the agent switches and a new pair of thresholds is generated. If one\ninterprets the price thresholds as representing the agent's rational future expectations then\nthe model is, both practically and philosophically, an EMH model. Differing expectations\ncause trading to occur but the lack of any kind of coupling between agents ensures the\n'correct' pricing outcome.\n3\n\n\fA propensity towards herding, either due to subconscious psychology or conscious\nmomentum-trading strategies, was then introduced via the introduction of an additional\nthreshold for each agent. While an agent is in the minority their herding pressure increases\nuntil they switch to join the majority (unless the majority position changes, or they switch\ndue to the price thresholds being violated, before this occurs). The main conclusion to be\ndeduced from these early models was that, at least within this modeling scenario, herding\ncauses fat-tails and excess kurtosis in the price return data but not volatility clustering.\nHowever, long-term correlations in the volatility could be induced by allowing the volatility to depend upon the market sentiment and/or allowing correlations in the information\nstream. A detailed statistical analysis [7] showed that all of the important stylized facts\ncould be reproduced and others, such as the asymmetry between large positive and negative\nmoves, could also be introduced using asymmetric herding.\n\nIII.\n\nMOVING-THRESHOLD MODELS\n\nThe inclusion of additional non-EMH effects, using the above approach, would require\nmore thresholds. However,a much more elegant threshold-based approach is to allow the\noriginal pair of price-thresholds to vary with time between switchings. The full mathematical\nmoving-threshold model is now described and more detailed economic justifications for the\nmodeling assumptions can be found in [4, 5, 7].\nThe system is incremented in timesteps of length h and each of M agents can be either\nshort or long the asset over each time interval. The position of the ith investor over the nth\ntime interval is represented by si (n) = \u00b11 (+1 long, \u22121 short). The price of the asset at the\nend of the nth time interval is p(n) and for simplicity the system is drift-free so that p(n)\n\ncorresponds to the return relative to the risk-free interest rate plus equity-risk premium or\nthe expected rate of return. An important variable is the sentiment defined as the average\nof the states of all of the M investors\n\u03c3(n) =\n\nM\n1 X\nsi (n).\nM i=1\n\n(1)\n\nand \u2206\u03c3(n) = \u03c3(n) \u2212 \u03c3(n \u2212 1).\nThe pricing formula is given by\np(n + 1) = p(n) exp\n\n\u0010\u0010\u221a\n\n\u0011\n\nh\u03b7(n) \u2212 h/2 f (\u03c3) + \u03ba\u2206\u03c3(n)\n4\n\n\u0011\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere \u03ba > 0 and\n\n\u221a\n\nh\u03b7(n) \u223c N (0, h) represents the exogenous information stream. Note\n\nthat when \u03ba = 0 and f \u2261 1 the price follows a geometric Brownian motion.\n\nSuppose that at time n the ith investor has just switched and the current price is P .\n\nThen a pair of numbers XL , XU > 0 are generated from some random distribution and\nthe lower and upper thresholds for that agent are set to be Li (n) = P/(1 + XL ) and\nUi (n) = (1 + XU )P respectively. Defining the evolution of these thresholds now corresponds\nto defining a strategy for the ith investor. Such strategies can be made arbitrarily complicated\nand may be partly rational (and conscious) and partly irrational (and subconscious). They\ncan also be constructed to include perverse incentives or inductive learning strategies as\nrequired.\nThree simple examples are of particular note. Firstly, as noted above, the case where\nthe thresholds are fixed (until the agent switches again) completely decouples the agents'\nbehaviour and gives EMH pricing. Secondly, we can mimic the herding effect by causing the\nthresholds to move together (increasing Li and decreasing Ui ) whenever the ith agent is in\nthe minority. Thus agents in the minority have a higher tendency to switch into the majority\nthan vice versa. Thirdly, we can suppose that a simple, unspecified, perverse incentive is in\nplace, causing agents to prefer one of the states over the other, say +1 over \u22121. This can\nbe recreated by moving the thresholds closer together whenever si (n) = \u22121.\nThe threshold approach should be contrasted with the more common one taken in the\nliterature of Markovian-type switching between investment positions or strategies ([8] and\nnumerous others). Here the threshold values Li , Ui act as 'hidden variables' that are highlyhistory dependent. Much of human behaviour is, of course, also non-Markovian with decisions being made over a period of time, rather than being spontaneously formulated and\nacted upon. Finally, we emphasize that the purpose of such simple models is to help gain\ninsights into EMH violations and their causal relationships to the observed statistical properties of real markets.\n\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nWe first select parameters for the model to simulate daily price variations. The time\nvariable h is defined in terms of the variance of the external information stream. A daily\nvariance in price returns of 0.6\u20130.7% suggests a value for h of 0.00004. The system properties\n5\n\n\fare independent of the number of agents, for large enough M, and M = 100 appears to be\nsufficient. The simulations are run for 10000 timesteps which corresponds to approximately\n40 years of trading.\nThe parameter \u03ba is a measure of the market depth and the relative importance of external\nnoise versus changes in internal supply/demand on the asset price. It is difficult to estimate\na priori, but \u03ba = 0.2 generates price output that is correlated with, but noticably distinct\nfrom, the EMH price defined by \u03b7(n) alone.\nThe initial thresholds XL , XU are chosen from the uniform distribution on the interval\n[0.1, 0.3], corresponding to price moves in the range 10\u201330%. Simulations have indicated\nthat the models are robust to changes in the exact form of the distribution and so a uniform\ndistribution was chosen. Let us consider first the case where the thresholds are fixed. If\nf (\u03c3) \u2261 1 and the initial states are sufficiently mixed so that \u03c3(0) \u2248 0, then as explained in\nSection III, the model conforms to the EMH and the price is simply\np(n + 1) \u2248 p(n) exp\n\n\u0010\u221a\n\n\u0011\n\nh\u03b7(n) \u2212 h/2 .\n\n(3)\n\nAs argued in [1, 4, 7], the effect of noise traders (who are not explicitly included) is\nunlikely to be constant over time. We posit that their number, and therefore also their\neffect, is greater at times of high sentiment, both positive and negative. This is simulated\nby increasing the price-changing effect of the external information stream at such times by\nthe use of the function\nf (\u03c3) = 1 + 2|\u03c3|\nin (2).\nNow let us introduce herding by supposing that for agents in the minority position\nLi (n + 1) = Li (n) + Ci h|\u03c3(n)|,\n\nUi (n + 1) = Ui (n) \u2212 Ci h|\u03c3(n)|.\n\nThe thresholds are fixed for agents in the majority position. Note that the change in the\nposition of the thresholds is proportional to the length of the timestep and the magnitude of\nthe sentiment. The constant of proportionality Ci is different, but fixed, for each agent and\nchosen from the uniform distribution on [0, 100]. This range of parameters corresponds to\na herding tendency that operates over a timescale of several months or longer. The results\nof a simulation are shown in Figure 1 and are very similar to those obtained in [4, 7] where\nmultiple, fixed thresholds were used.\n6\n\n\f1\n\n0.5\nSentiment\n\nPrice\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n0.5\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n6000\nTime\n\n8000\n\n\u22121\n\n10000\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n6000\nTime\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nTime Delay\n\n80\n\n100\n\n3\n\n10\n\nAutocorrelations\n\nCumulative Distribution\n\n0.5\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n15\nDaily Returns (%)\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n20\n\nFIG. 1: Results of a simulation over 10000 timesteps including herding.\n\nThe top left plot shows both the output price p(n) (more volatile) and the EMH pricing\nobtained from (3) (less volatile). As can be seen there are significant periods of price\nmismatching. The top right figure plots the sentiment against time. Periods of bullish and\nbearish sentiments lasting several years can be observed. The bottom left picture shows\nclear evidence of a fat-tailed distribution in the price returns and this is also confirmed\nby measures of the excess kurtosis which range from approximately 10\u201330. Finally, the two\ncurves in the bottom right figure are the autocorrelation decays for both the price returns and\ntheir absolute values (the volatility). There is no correlation observable in the price returns,\neven for lags of a single day, while the volatility autocorelation decays slowly over several\nmonths - evidence of volatility clustering. Further numerical testing revealed very similar\nconclusions to those drawn from the previous fixed-threshold models. These were that, in\nthese models, herding causes fat tails but not volatility clustering since the decay in the\nvolatility autocorrelation vanishes after just a few days when f (\u03c3) = 1. Also, measurements\nof power-law exponents similar to those carried out in [7] provided estimates close to those\nobserved in analyses of price data from real markets.\nWe now suppose that, in addition to the herding and sentiment-dependent volatility, a\nperverse incentive is in place that makes it advantageous to be in the state +1. This is\nachieved by including the following extra rule when an agent is in the state si (n) = \u22121\nLi (n + 1) = Li (n) + Rh,\n\nUi (n + 1) = Ui (n) \u2212 Rh.\n\nThe value R = 100 was chosen to make the incentive the same order of magnitude as the\n7\n\n\f3.5\n\n1\n\n3\n0.5\nSentiment\n\nPrice\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n6000\nTime\n\n8000\n\n\u22121\n\n10000\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n6000\nTime\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nTime Delay\n\n80\n\n100\n\n10\n\nAutocorrelations\n\nCumulative Distribution\n\n0.5\n3\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n15\nDaily Returns (%)\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n20\n\nFIG. 2: Results of a simulation over 10000 timesteps including both herding and a perverse incentive. The incentive is removed after 5000 timesteps.\n\nherding propensity. The incentive is then switched off after 5000 timesteps. Results for a\ntypical simulation are shown in Figure 2.\nThe effect of the incentive can be seen in both the price and sentiment variables, where\nboth the average value and the volatility of the variables are increased. This simulation\nmerely serves as a prototype for the kinds of studies that can be performed and more\nsystematic investigations are clearly required in order to draw reliable inferences. These will\nbe reported elsewhere.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper an agent's strategy (in the loosest sense of the word) is defined to be a\ncombination of all the rational, inductive learning, psychological and rational-but-perverse\nfactors influencing their decision to switch positions or stay put. We have shown that such\nstrategies can be represented by moving thresholds and can be as simple or as complicated\nas desired. Indeed the most serious modeling restrictions in the caricature systems simulated\nabove are not in the assumptions behind the moving threshold approach, but in the assumptions made upon the market itself. Giving agents the option to leave the market, a choice\nof assets, and allowing their strategies to depend upon their current wealth are all obvious\nfirst directions in which the models could be extended. However, it seems unlikely that the\ncausal relationships between strategies, as defined above, and global market properties will\n\n8\n\n\fbe understood in complex systems until they are understood in simpler ones.\n\n[1] G.W.
