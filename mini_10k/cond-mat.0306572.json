A\nparticularly active research area is the design of mixers for microdevices. This task has proven\nitself to be a real engineering challenge due to a variety of physical and practical constraints.\nPhysically, the typical cross-sectional dimensions of microchannels in current microfluidic systems are on the order of 10 \u2212 100 \u03bcm ([2, 4]). On this scale, practical flows of common liquids\n(U \u2248 0.1 \u2212 10 cm/s) have low Reynolds numbers, Re < 10, and turbulent mixing of the fluid\ndoes not generally occur. At the same time, the Peclet number for mass transfer in these flows,\ndefined as the ratio of a typical diffusive time to a typical advection time is high, P e > 100,\nand purely diffusive mixing across the flow is slow. For applications that require mixing, it is\ntherefore necessary to design channels that will lead to efficient convective mixing.\nIn a channel geometry, the strongest gradients of concentration are typically oriented in\na direction normal to the principal axis of the channel, because the gradients exist between\nco-flowing streams of distinct chemical makeup. An effective mixing flow in a channel must\ntherefore stir the fluid over the cross-section with transverse flows as the fluid progresses downstream in the axial flow; such a flow must possess three non-zero components. An effective\nstirring flow rapidly folds the fluid into itself so as to decrease the distance that diffusion must\nact to homogenize concentrations. The potential of a given channel-flow to mix efficiently can\nbe judged by several characteristics: (1) the ratio of the transverse to the axial velocities. If this\nratio is too small, then the axial length of channel required for mixing is likely to be impractically long, regardless of the detailed character of the flow; (2) the distribution of transverse\nflows within the cross-section of the channel. If the flows are confined to small areas within\nthe cross-section, then they will be ineffective at exchanging fluid between these areas and with\nareas in which no flow exists. (3) the evolution of the transverse flows as a function of axial\nposition along the channel. An efficient mixer should produce Lagrangian chaos; in particular,\nno streamwise symmetries should be present [5]. This feature is achieved in a channel-geometry\nwhen the position and orientation of transverse flows vary axially such that all fluid elements\ntravelling in the channel experience an alternating sequence of rotational and extensional flows\n2\n\n\f([6]).\nIn designing a laminar mixer for microfluidic applications, it is also important to take into\naccount the constraints imposed by technology and conversation laws. Designs of mixers should\nbe scalable to smaller systems, resistant to fouling by particulate matter, and efficient with\nrespect to power consumption. Moreover, the typical lithographic processes currently used in\nmicrofabrication lead to planar geometries.\nA variety of active ([7, 8]) and passive ([9, 10, 11, 12, 13]) methods have recently been\nproposed to generate stirring flows for mixing purposes. All of the passive designs that have\nbeen demonstrated to be effective rely however on multilayer or non-planar structures in order\nto generate three-dimensional flows. A single lithographic step generates a single flat layer of\nstructure with horizontal top and bottom walls and (relatively) vertical side walls (see Figure\n1) ([14]). More complicated structures, e.g. a non-intersecting cross-over between two channels,\nrequire multiple lithographic steps, with spatial alignment between each layer of structure. Each\nadded layer of structure increases the difficulty of fabrication and complicates scaling down to\nsmaller devices.\nMotivated by such practical considerations in this paper, we will be interested in characterizing the potential for mixing of the simplest planar geometrical configurations obtained in a\nsingle fabrication step. Two such geometries are illustrated in Figure 1. Suppose we fabricate\na channel constrained between two parallel planes of constant separation, can such a configuration mix? In order to be able to give an answer to this question that is robust to change in\nflow conditions, we will assume zero Reynolds number flows in the channel. This assumption\nalso implies that our conclusions will remain valid in smaller flow systems of the same design.\nIt is known that the steady-state velocity field in a straight channel of constant rectangular\ncross section is unidirectional ([15]) and therefore cannot mix except by molecular diffusion;\nsimilarly, the velocity field in a curved channel of constant cross-section and constant curvature\nis unidirectional ([16])[27]. As a consequence, the simplest potential design for a steady-state\nmixer for Stokes flow is that of a channel with variations of shape, that include changes of both\ncurvature and cross-sectional dimensions in the streamwise direction.\nIn order for flow in such a channel to potentially mix by advection in the three dimensions\nof the channel, the velocity field needs three non-zero components. While it is clear that these\nvariations in shape will lead to non-zero in-plane components of the velocity, as would also\n3\n\n\fbe the case in a truly two-dimensional channel, it is not obvious that the (third) out-of-plane\ncomponent will always be non-zero. We ask therefore the following question: under which\ncircumstances is the out-of-plane component of the velocity field always non-zero? And in this\ncase, what is the expected magnitude of the vertical flow?\nThe flows in a circular pipe of varying cross-section ([17]) or varying small curvature ([18])\nhave been studied and three-dimensional flow is obtained at zero Reynolds number. However,\nbecause the equation for the shape of a circular pipe couples the two directions that are perpendicular to its axis of symmetry, these results cannot be applied to the flow in a planar geometry\nand a separate analysis has to be carried out. Recently, Balsa [19] studied the secondary flow\nin a Hele-Shaw cell in which a vertical cylinder is immersed, at Reynolds number unity based\non the cylinder length, and showed the presence of streamwise vorticity in a boundary layer on\nthe cylinder surface; an earlier study by Thompson [20] focused on viscous features.\nThe geometry of a generic microchannel constrained between two parallel planes with fixed\nseparation and with no obstacles is illustrated in Figure 1 (top). The shape of the channel can\nbe entirely described by two degrees of freedom: (1) the shape of its centerline plane and (2)\nthe local symmetric width of the channel around this centerline. We will consider in this paper\nthe consequences of both and will treat each of them separately for simplicity.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II A we consider the case of a straight channel\nwith varying cross section in the direction perpendicular to both the flow and the constraint\nplane and in section II B we consider the case of a curved channel of constant cross section\nbut varying curvature. In both cases, under the assumption of an arbitrary but slowly varying\ncross section and curvature respectively, we show that the velocity component perpendicular\nto the constraint plane cannot be zero unless cross-section and curvature are both constant,\nand therefore the flow is fully three-dimensional in all other cases. We apply these results in\nsection III where we calculate the leading-order velocity field in the case of a straight channel\nof varying cross section and illustrate the flow patterns on a sinusoidally varying channel. We\nconclude in section IV with a discussion of both the practical advantages and limitations that\nthese results imply for mixing design. Appendices A 1 and A 2 present proofs for some of the\nresults used in sections II A and II B respectively and Appendix B presents the calculation for\nthe leading-order velocity field in the case of a channel of arbitrary shape.\n\n4\n\n\fII.\n\nTHREE-DIMENSIONALITY OF THE FLOW\nA.\n\nStraight microchannel of varying cross section\n\nIn this section we consider the case of a straight microchannel of varying cross section, as\nillustrated in Figure 2. A pressure-driven flow takes place in the x direction of a channel of\nconstant height 2h in the z-direction and varying width 2hf (x/\u03bb) in the y direction, where \u03bb\nis the axial length scale on which such variations occur. The equations of motion and mass\nconservation for an incompressible Stokes flow are written\n\u2207p = \u03bc\u22072 u,\n\n\u2207.u = 0\n\n(1)\n\nwith the no-slip boundary condition u(x, y = \u00b1hf (x/\u03bb), z) = u(x, y, z = \u00b1h) = 0, on the four\nbounding surfaces. The flow rate Q is set by upstream conditions and is constant\nZ\n\nh\n\u2212h\n\nZ\n\n+hf (x/\u03bb)\n\n(u.ex ) dy dz = Q.\n\n(2)\n\n\u2212hf (x/\u03bb)\n\nWe now make the assumption that the width of the channel is slowly varying. If we define\n\u01eb = h/\u03bb, this assumption is equivalent to assuming that \u01eb \u226a 1. Using the notations u = (u, v, w)\nfor the velocity field, we can now nondimensionalize the previous set of equations (1)-(2) by\nscaling lengths, velocities and pressure by\n(x, y, z) = (\u03bbx\u0303, h\u1ef9, hz\u0303),\n\n(u, v, w) =\n\nQ\n(\u0169, \u01eb\u1e7d, \u01ebw\u0303),\nh2\n\np=\n\n\u03bb\u03bcQ\np\u0303.\nh4\n\n(3)\n\nDropping the tildes in the dimensionless variables for convenience, the dimensionless Stokes\nequation is\n\u2207p =\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n\u22022\n\u22022 h 2 2 i\n2 \u2202\nu, \u01eb v, \u01eb w\n+\n+\n\u01eb\n\u2202x2 \u2202y 2 \u2202z 2\n\n(4)\n\nand the dimensionless continuity equation is\n\n\u2202u \u2202v \u2202w\n+\n+\n= 0.\n\u2202x \u2202y\n\u2202z\n\n(5)\n\nWe look for a regular perturbation expansion for both the velocity and pressure fields under\nthe form\n(u, v, w, p) = (u0 , v0 , w0 , p0 ) + \u01eb2 (u2 , v2 , w2 , p2 ) + O(\u01eb4 )\n5\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhich is usual in lubrication theory (see e.g. [21]). The leading-order O(\u01eb0 ) term of Stokes\nequation (1) is given by\n\u2202p0\n=\n\u2202x\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22022\n\u22022\n+\n\u2202y 2 \u2202z 2\n\n\u0013\n\nu0 ,\n\n\u2202p0\n\u2202p0\n=\n=0\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\n\n(7)\n\nsubject to the no-slip boundary condition u0 (x, y = \u00b1f (x), z) = u0 (x, y, z = \u00b11) = 0, and\nconstant flow rate\n4\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nZ\n\nf (x)\n\nu0 dy dz = 1.\n\n(8)\n\n0\n\nThe axial velocity u0 is then easily calculated by separation of variables ([15])\n(\n)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\nX\n4(\u22121)\ncosh kn y\n1 dp0\n(z 2 \u2212 1) +\ncos kn z\nu0 (x, y, z) =\n3\n2 dx\nkn\ncosh kn f (x)\nn\u22650\n\n(9)\n\nwith kn = (n + 21 )\u03c0. This solution is simply the axial Poiseuille velocity in a straight channel\nof constant cross section evaluated at each location along the channel. The leading-order axial\npressure gradient is then given by the flow rate condition (8) which leads to\n3\ndp0\n=\ndx\n4f (x)\n\n(\n\n6 X tanh(kn f (x))\n\u22121\nf (x) n\u22650\nkn5\n\n)\u22121\n\n*\n\n(10)\n\nNote that (4) and (5) show that at next order in \u01eb2 , the leading-order out of plane velocity\nfield (v0 , w0 ) satisfies a two-dimensional Stokes equation with an effective distribution of mass\nsources and sinks given by \u2212du0 /dx. Let us now assume these sources and sinks lead to a\nplanar velocity field is planar in the sense that the component of the velocity perpendicular to\nthe constraint plane is zero, w0 = 0. In this case, the continuity equation from (1) is written\n\u2202u0 \u2202v0\n+\n= 0,\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\n(11)\n\nand allows us to solve explicitly for the y-component of the velocity v0 . Using the fact that u0\nsatisfies the no-slip condition on the walls of the channels, it is straightforward to obtain that\nv0 is given by\n\u2202\nv0 (x, y, z) =\n\u2202x\n\nZ\n\ny\n\nu0 (x, y \u2032 , z) dy \u2032 .\n\n(12)\n\n\u2212f (x)\n\nThe solution (12) satisfies the no-slip conditions for v0 at z = \u00b11 and y = \u2212f (x). If it also\nsatisfies the remaining no-slip condition at y = f (x) then the leading-order solution would be\n\n6\n\n\fentirely characterized and the flow would be planar at leading-order. The condition at y = f (x)\nwill however be satisfied if and only if\n\u2202\n\u2202x\n\nZ\n\nf (x)\n\nu0 (x, y \u2032 , z) dy \u2032 = 0\n\n(13)\n\n\u2212f (x)\n\nfor all values of x and z in the channel. Using the solution (9), (13) can be integrated once to\nget\ndp0\ndx\n\n(\nX (\u22121)n\nn\u22650\n\nkn4\n\n(tanh(kn f (x)) \u2212 kn ) cos kn z\n\n)\n\n= \u03a6(z).\n\n(14)\n\nIn order for equation (14) to be satisfied for all |z| \u2264 1 and x \u2265 0, it is then necessary that for\nall n \u2265 0,\n\ndp0\n(tanh(kn f (x)) \u2212 kn ) = \u03b4n\ndx\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the {\u03b4n } are constants independent of x. As is shown in Appendix A 1, this can only\nbe true if f (x) is constant, i.e. if the channel cross section is constant. As a consequence,\nthe vertical component of the velocity field w0 cannot be zero unless the cross section of the\nchannel is constant, in which case v0 = w0 = 0. When this is not the case and the cross section\nis changing along the channel, then the two-dimensional solution (9)-(12) is inconsistent and\nthe velocity field is fully three-dimensional at this order.\n\nB.\n\nChannel of constant cross section with varying curvature\n\nWe now proceed in the same manner as in section II A for the case of the channel of constant\ncross section but varying curvature, as illustrated in Figure 3. A pressure-driven flow takes\nplace in the axial direction, denoted as s, of a channel of constant height 2h in the z-direction\nand constant width 2d in the third direction, denoted as n for \"normal\". The centerline of\nthe channel is not straight but curved with local radius of curvature R(s) = R0 f (s/\u03bb) in the\northogonal (en , es , ez ) frame, where \u03bb is the typical length scale along the channel on which this\nlocal curvature changes.

As is shown in Appendix A 2, (36) can be\nsatisfied if and only if f (s) is constant, i.e. if the curvature of the channel is constant, in\nwhich case v0 = w0 = 0. When this is not the case and the curvature is changing along the\nchannel, then the two-dimensional solution (25)-(33) is inconsistent and the velocity field is\nfully three-dimensional at this order.\n\nIII.\n\nILLUSTRATION OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL FLOWS\n\nWe have demonstrated in the previous two sections that flows in channels constrained to\nremain in a layer of constant thickness are in general three-dimensional, i.e. they possess a\nnon-zero component of the velocity perpendicular to the constraint plane. We illustrate these\nresults in this section for the case studied in section II A of a straight channel of varying width.\nWe calculate the three components of the leading-order velocity field (u0 , v0 , w0 ) and illustrate\nthe flow patterns in a sinusoidally varying channel; the calculation for the general case of an\nasymmetric channel is more intricate and we present it in Appendix B for the interested reader.\n\nA.\n\nGoverning equations\n\nBecause the velocity field (u0 , v0 , w0 ) is three-dimensional, the continuity equation in (1)\nbecomes\n\u2202u0 \u2202v0 \u2202w0\n+\n+\n= 0,\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\n11\n\n(37)\n\n\fwhere u0 is still given by equation (9). Under Stokes flow conditions, the pressure is harmonic\n\u22072 p = 0, and therefore the velocity field always satisfies the biharmonic equation \u22074 u = 0.\nConsequently, within the lubrication approximation (3) and (6), the y and z component of the\ndimensionless velocity field satisfy\n\u22074\u22a5 v0\n\n= 0,\n\n\u22072\u22a5\n\nwhere\n\n\u2261\n\n\u22074\u22a5 w0 = 0.\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22022\n\u22022\n+\n\u2202y 2 \u2202z 2\n\n\u0013\n\n(38a)\n(38b)\n\nSimilarly, the vorticity is harmonic \u22072 \u03c9 = 0, so that under the lubrication approximation, its\nleading-order axial component \u03c90 =\n\n\u2202w0\n\u2202y\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2202v0\n\u2202z\n\nsatisfies\n\n\u22072\u22a5 \u03c90 = 0.\n\n(39)\n\nIt is necessary to solve the set of equations (37), (38) and (39) along with the no-slip boundary\nconditions in order to obtain the final solution for (v0 , w0 ).\n\nB.\n\nSubset of equations\n\nLet us now show that it is sufficient to solve equations (37) and (38a) to obtain (38b) and\n(39). Let us suppose (37) and (38a) are satisfied. Evaluating the bi-harmonic \u22072\u22a5 of the\ncontinuity equation (37) leads to\n\u2202 4\n\u2207 w0 = 0 \u2192 \u22074\u22a5 w0 = \u0393(x, y).\n\u2202z \u22a5\n\n(40)\n\nBecause of the symmetries in the configuration illustrated in Figure 1, the solution of Stokes\nequation has to satisfy w0 (x, y, \u2212z) = \u2212w0 (x, y, z) (and also v0 (x, y, \u2212z) = v0 (x, y, z)). Conse-\n\nquently \u22074\u22a5 w0 is also odd with respect to z and necessarily \u0393(x, y) = 0, so that equation (38b)\n\nis satisfied. In the same fashion, it is straightforward from (37) to obtain\n\u2202\u03c90\n= 0 \u2192 \u03c90 = \u039b(x, y).\n\u2202z\n\n(41)\n\nUsing the fact that w0 and v0 are respectively odd and even with respect to z, it is clear that \u03c90\nis odd with respect to z so that \u039b(x, y) = 0. The result of equation (39) is therefore recovered.\nAs a consequence, it is sufficient to solve equations (37) and (38a) to obtain the complete\nsolution for the leading-order velocity field.\n12\n\n\fC.\n\nVelocity field calculation\n\nTo obtain the leading-order solution for the three-dimensional velocity field in the channel,\nwe solve equations (38a) and (37), along with the no-slip boundary conditions for v0 and w0\nand with the axial velocity u0 given by (9). In order to do so, we use the technique introduced\nmore than a century ago by Lam\u00e9 ([23]) to solve planar elasticity problem where biharmonic\nequations arise (see also the general discussion in [24]). Here we effectively demonstrate that\nthese ideas also apply as well to slowly varying flows.

The infinite system of linear equations (49) was solved\nnumerically by truncating it at finite values of n and m. The integrals in (50) only involve\nlinear and trigonometric functions and are evaluated exactly. Note that apart from the system\n(49), summations are also involved in equations (10) for the pressure gradient and (50c) for\nbm (x), and they also require numerical truncations.\nFor each case, numerical results were obtained, the truncation was refined and the results\nwere found to converge quickly to a final solution. The truncations at n = 50 in equations\n(10) and (50c) were found to be suitable to obtain the final solution. Further, a truncation at\nn = m = 20 in the infinite set of linear equations equation (49) was also found to be appropriate\nto resolve the flow fields, with results essentially unchanged for higher truncation numbers.\nSuch techniques allow us to obtain everywhere in space the three leading-order velocity\ncomponents and therefore, with a simple time advancement scheme, to follow the motion of\nindividual fluid elements and obtain streamlines.\nThe main results of our flow illustration are displayed in Figures 4, 5 and 6. Figure 4 presents\nin-plane velocity plots at three locations along the channel direction, as well as iso-value maps\nat these locations for both in-plane velocity components (v0 ,w0 ) and for the axial component\nof the vorticity (\u03c90 ) [29]. Figure 5 displays the flow streamlines along the expansion part of the\n15\n\n\fchannel (3\u03c0/2 < x < 5\u03c0/2). Finally, Figure 6 displays the maximum cross-sectional as well as\naverage value of the three components (u0 , v0 , w0 ) of the leading-order dimensionless velocity\nas a function of the location along the channel centerline.\nThe numerical results confirm that the flow at leading-order is fully three-dimensional. The\nplots in Figure 4 allow us to visualize the regions of high and low velocity and vorticity and\nthe streamlines in Figure 5 show the fluid elements are indeed vertically displaced as they are\nadvected along the channel. Note that the similar plots for the contracting part of the channel\nwere not included here as they can be deduced from those in Figure 4 and 5 by symmetry of\nStokes's equation.\nWe also note in Figure 4 that the qualitative picture for the iso-values of v0 do not vary much\nbetween the point of minimum width (x = 3\u03c0/2) and the point of maximum width (x = 5\u03c0/2).\nIn contrast to v0 , the distribution of vertical velocity w0 is modified appreciably: it changes\nfrom a monotonic variation across the channel (left picture in Figure 4c) to a variation with\nlocal minimum/maximum in the middle of the channel and global maximum/minimum near\nthe channel walls (middle and right picture in Figure 4c). Moreover, as can be seen in Figure\n4d, the axial vorticity is maximum at the top and bottom walls and decays towards the middle\nof the channel (z=0); the contracting part is therefore the position along the channel where the\nstrongest stirring of material surfaces would occur.\nFurther, the results of Figure 6 show that under the lubrication approximation, the\nmagnitude of the vertical flow component w0 decreases monotonically during an expansion\n(3\u03c0/2 < x < 5\u03c0/2); by symmetry of Stokes's equation, w0 increases in a similar fashion during\na contraction of the channel, (\u03c0/2 < x < 3\u03c0/2).\nWe see also that for the particular case considered here, and within the lubrication approximation, the leading-order y-component of the velocity v0 is always about one order of\nmagnitude smaller that the axial component u0 and that the vertical component w0 is about\none order of magnitude smaller than v0 ; back to the dimensional variables, these statements\nbecome v \u2248 \u01ebu/10 and w \u2248 \u01ebu/100.\nFinally, the integrated effect of the vertical flow along the channel length is illustrated in\nFigure 5 by the vertical deflection of streamlines. The deflection is larger far from the horizontal\ncenterplane (see Figure 5b) and far from the vertical centerplane (see Figure 5a). Over the\nchannel half period, a fluid element on the upper right streamline in Figure 5a experiences a\n16\n\n\fvertical displacement of about 10% of the channel half-height.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have shown in this paper that the only planar channel shapes for which the velocity field\nis two-dimensional under Stokes flow conditions have both constant curvature and constant\ncross section (in which case the flow field is in fact unidirectional). In all other cases for\nthe variation of the cross-section and curvature, the velocity is fully three-dimensional at zero\nReynolds number and could in principle be used to mix species in simple microdevices that can\nbe manufactured with one step of microfabrication.\nA qualitative summary for the occurrence of the third component of the flow can be given\nusing the two-dimensionality condition, i.e. equation (13) or (34). The velocity field remains\nR\ntwo-dimensional in the channel if the two-dimensional flow rate Q(z) = udy is constant along\nthe channel for each z. When this is not the case and Q(z) is streamwise-dependent, a vertical\nvelocity component is induced by mass conservation. What our study shows is that, under\nthe lubrication approximation, the only channel geometries with no embedded obstacles for\nwhich this is not the case are those of both constant width and constant curvature. Note that\nalternatively, the presence of obstacles such as cylinders in an otherwise straight channel would\nprovide similar geometric features necessary for the occurrence of a three-dimensional flow [20].\nAs the general form of the continuity equation shows, the magnitude of the ratio of the outof-plane velocity component w to the axial component u scales as the ratio of the cross-sectional\nlength scale h to the length scale \u03bb over which the variations of the channel geometry occur,\nw\nh\n\u2248 = \u01eb.\nu\n\u03bb\n\n(54)\n\nThe numerical results presented in section III E for a sinusoidal change in cross-section show\nthat the prefactors for this scaling is about 0.01 for the ratio of the leading-order velocity fields\nw0 to u0 and indicate poor mixing. For the case h \u2248 \u03bb, we could expect however all orders in\nthe perturbation expansion to contribute in a non trivial way, and we expect therefore that with\nthis simple design a vertical flow of strength comparable to the axial flow could exist; if that\nis not the case and the prefactors for the full calculation are not of order one, the channel will\nlikely present poor mixing characteristics. Note that as the Reynolds number in micromixers\n17\n\n\fis not exactly zero but can be as high as 100, we also expect in this case the occurrence of\nnon-trivial Dean flow-like contributions to the vertical flow.\nWe propose to design \"planar mixers\" by a succession of n mixing cells of length \u03bb along a\nsingle channel. In each cell, we expect the integrated displacements \u03b4y and \u03b4z of fluid elements\nin the cross-section, advected by the flow at velocity Uaxial , to be given by\n\u03b4y \u2248 \u03b4z \u2248 t\u22a5 U\u22a5 ,\n\n(55)\n\nwhere t\u22a5 is the residence time for the flow in the cell t\u22a5 \u2248 \u03bb/Uaxial and U\u22a5 is the magnitude\nof the transverse flow, at most U\u22a5 \u2248 hUaxial /\u03bb so that \u03b4y \u2248 \u03b4z \u2248 h. Since the total length\nof the mixer is n\u03bb and the displacements \u03b4y and \u03b4z are independent of the cell length, small\ncells \u03bb \u2248 h should be chosen. The challenge in the mixing design would then concern (1) the\ndesign of each cell, i.e. the variations of its radius of curvature and its cross-section, in order to\nobtain the maximum cross-sectional displacement and (2) the setup of the cell succession in a\nway that mixing adds up instead of cancelling out; for example the channel studied in section\nIII E would obviously make very poor mixing cells because by symmetry of Stokes flow, every\nfluid stirring taking place in one part of the channel would be unstirred in the other part of the\nchannel located immediately downstream. In general, good performance may be achieved by\navoiding any geometrical symmetry along the streamwise direction.\nThe calculations presented in this paper assumed slowly varying cross-sectional and curvature change along the channel, \u01eb \u226a 1. As was shown by Lucas (1972) for two-dimensional\nchannels of varying shape, the regular perturbation expansions (6) or (22) are expected to have\nhave order one or larger radius of convergence in \u01eb; as a consequence, the conclusions reached\nusing the leading-order velocity fields are valid for the entire velocity field when \u01eb is O(1), and\npresumably higher even though our results cannot be applied directly. With current microfabrication techniques, the minimum in-plane dimension (\u2248 \u03bb) that can be generated is typically\ngreater than the minimum out-of-plane dimension (\u2248 h). As a consequence, the cross-sectional\ndimensions of microchannels tend to satisfy the criterion, \u01eb < 1, and the results obtained in\nthis paper are expected to apply for all such cases.\nThe limitation of the passive mixing strategy proposed here lies in the top-bottom symmetry\nfor the velocity field, (u, v, w)(x, y, \u2212z) = (u, v, \u2212w)(x, y, z), due to the symmetries of the\nStokes equations. Mixing can therefore not be achieved between the fluids located in the z > 0\n18\n\n\fand z < 0 planes and consequently, the streams of solutions that are to be mixed must be\nintroduced at the inlet of the channel with alignment in the vertical direction. The case of a\nstraight channel of varying section studied in section II A also possess a right/left symmetry,\n(u, v, w)(x, \u2212y, z) = (u, \u2212v, w)(x, y, z), (see Figure 4) and therefore cannot mix species fluids\nlocated in the y > 0 and y < 0 planes. The configuration studied in section II B does not\npossess such a symmetry and should be used to transport fluid between the n > 0 and n < 0\nplanes, similarly to what was achieved in Stroock et al. (2002). A fully numerical approach\nto the problem (using e.g. a boundary element method or a commercial code) would allow a\ndetailed study of the proposed mixing design, its optimization, and dispersion characteristics.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledge fruitful discussions with M.
