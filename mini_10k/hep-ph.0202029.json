INTRODUCTION\n\nWith the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), nuclear collision\nphysics entered the collider era. New phenomena have been presented in Au + Au collisions\n\u221a\nat the center-of-mass energy s = 130 GeV/nucleon [1]. Negative hadron multiplicities\nare significantly increased compared to proton-antiproton collisions [2]. Some of the data,\nsuch as the antiproton-to-proton ratios [3], are reported to contradict perturbative Quantum\nChromodynamics (pQCD) calculations. Initial efforts to understand hadron spectra from\nnuclear reactions at RHIC using pQCD have been published recently [4,5]. However, there\nis still a strong debate on how to apply pQCD to hadron production even in proton-proton\n(pp) collisions. With RHIC running at the full energy, and experiments at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) at several TeV/nucleon soon to follow, \"clean\" processes, where pQCD works\nwell in pp collisions, are needed to test pQCD in nuclear reactions at collider energies. It is\nparticularly important to distinguish between expected nuclear effects and \"new physics\".\nThe production of W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons has been extensively studied at Tevatron energy\n\u221a\n( s = 1.8 TeV). Perturbative QCD proved to be very successful in explaining the CDF [6]\nand D0 [7] data. Due to the large mass of W \u00b1 and Z 0 , and no final state rescattering in\ntheir production process, power corrections are expected to be small. Therefore, W \u00b1 and\nZ 0 production could provide a bench mark test for pQCD at RHIC and LHC in both pp and\nnuclear collisions. Luminosity remains a concern at RHIC, in particular in pp collisions.\nThe bulk of the data for W \u00b1 and Z 0 production is concentrated in the small transverse\nmomentum (pT ) region, where pT is much smaller than the corresponding heavy boson mass\n(M). When pT \u226a M, the pT distributions calculated order-by-order in \u03b1s in conventional\nfixed-order perturbation theory receive a large logarithm, ln(M 2 /p2T ), at every power of \u03b1s ,\neven in the leading order in \u03b1s . Therefore, at sufficiently small pT , the convergence of the\nconventional perturbative expansion in powers of \u03b1s is impaired, and the logarithms must\nbe resummed.\nResummation of the large logarithms in QCD can be carried out either in pT -space\n2\n\n\fdirectly, or in the so-called \"impact parameter\", b\u0303-space, which is a Fourier conjugate of\nthe pT -space. (Since we are also interested in nuclear collisions, we reserve the notation\nb for the usual impact parameter associated with the geometry of colliding heavy nuclei,\nand denote the mathematical tool used in the resummation procedure by the symbol b\u0303.)\nUsing the renormalization group equation technique, Collins and Soper improved the b\u0303-space\nresummation to resum all logarithms as singular as, lnm (M 2 /p2T )/p2T , as pT \u2192 0 [8]. In the\nframe work of this renormalization group improved b\u0303-space resummation, Collins, Soper,\nand Sterman (CSS) derived a formalism for the transverse momentum distribution of vector\nboson production in hadronic collisions [9]. In the CSS formalism, non-perturbative input is\nneeded for the large b\u0303 region. The dependence of the pQCD results on the non-perturbative\ninput is not weak if the original extrapolation proposed by CSS is used. Recently, a new\nextrapolation scheme was proposed, based on solving the renormalization group equations,\nincluding power corrections [10]. Using the new extrapolation formula, the dependence of\nthe pQCD result on the non-perturbative input was significantly reduced. This was achieved\nwithout matching the fixed-order calculations. The results agree with the D0 nd CDF data\n< 1 GeV to pT as large as the the vector\nvery well in the entire pT interval from pT \u223c\nmass. In addition, in this new extrapolation formalism, power corrections can be studied\nsystematically for pp to proton-nucleus (pA) to nucleus-nucleus (AB) collisions.\nFactorization plays a key role in pQCD predictions of observables. At RHIC and LHC,\nnuclear collisions reach an unprecedented energy scale. Factorization can not be extrapolated easily to AB collisions from hadron-hadron collisions [11], and power corrections may\nbecome important [12]. There are two types of power corrections: (1) Power corrections\ndirectly to the physical observables (type-I) and (2) power corrections to the evolution of\nrenormalization group equations (type-II). Type-I power correction are proportional to powers of (\u039bQCD /Q), Q being the physical large scale (momentum). These are small for W \u00b1\nand Z 0 production as a result of the large mass of the particles in question. Type-II power\ncorrections are proportional to powers of (\u039bQCD /\u03bc), with evolution scale \u03bc. Therefore,\n\n3\n\n\fphysical observables carry the effect of type-II power corrections for all \u03bc[Q0 , Q], with the\nboundary condition at the scale Q0 . Even with large mass, W \u00b1 and Z 0 can still carry a large\neffect of type-II power corrections. However, Ref. [10] provides a way to study the effect of\ntype-II power corrections numerically. Based on the numerical results presented in Ref. [10],\nthe effect of type-II power corrections is also expected to be small for heavy vector boson\nproduction in pp collisions. In nuclear collisions, type-II power corrections will be enhanced\nby the nuclear size. Here we study the effects of enhanced power correction in pA and AB\ncollisions.\nThe rapidity distribution of W \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons at LHC was calculated recently and\nthe effect of shadowing was discussed in this context [13]. The decay spectrum of Z 0 was\nsuggested as an alternative reference process for J/\u03c8 suppression at LHC, since the DrellYan lepton pairs at low mass are expected to be dominated by bb\u0304 decay. As most of the\nW \u00b1 and Z 0 bosons observed in the experiment will be in the small transverse momentum\nregion, it is of great interest to study the nuclear effects on massive gauge boson transverse\nmomentum distributions. These effects include both the nuclear modification of the parton\ndistribution function (shadowing), and the initial state power corrections. The second part\nof the present paper is devoted to these subjects.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review the CSS b\u0303-space\nresummation formalism and the new procedure [10] to extrapolate the pQCD calculation to\nthe large b\u0303 region is outlined. We give predictions for W \u00b1 and Z 0 transverse momentum\ndistributions from pp collision at both RHIC and LHC energies. The sensitivity of the\nprediction to the non-perturbative parameters is discussed. Nuclear effects on W \u00b1 and Z 0\ntransverse momentum distributions in pA and AB collisions are studied in Sections III and\nIV. In Section V, we present our conclusions. To make the paper reasonably self-contained,\nthe Appendix summarizes relevant details of the CSS formalism. We use h\u0304 = c = 1 units.\n\n4\n\n\fII. TRANSVERSE MOMENTUM DISTRIBUTION OF HEAVY VECTOR\nBOSONS IN PROTON-PROTON COLLISIONS\n\nIn this Section, we briefly review the CSS b\u0303-space resummation formalism (Section II A).\nIn Section II B we introduce the recently-proposed new formalism to extrapolate the perturbative calculation to the large b\u0303 region [10], and discuss the transverse momentum distribution of heavy vector bosons in pp collisions at RHIC and LHC energies.\n\nA. Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) formalism\n\nIn the production of heavy vector bosons (of mass M), when pT \u226a M, the pT distribution\ncalculated order-by-order in \u03b1s in conventional fixed-order perturbation theory receives a\nlarge logarithm, ln(M 2 /p2T ), at every power of \u03b1s . Even at the leading order in \u03b1s , the cross\nsection d\u03c3/dM 2 dy dp2T contains a term proportional to (\u03b1s /p2T ) ln(M 2 /p2T ) coming from the\npartonic subprocess q + q\u0304 \u2192 V + g, where V = \u03b3 \u2217 , W \u00b1 or Z 0 . Beyond the leading order,\nwe actually get two powers of the logarithm for every power of \u03b1s , due to soft and collinear\ngluons emitted by the incoming partons. Therefore, at sufficiently small pT , the convergence\nof the conventional perturbative expansion in powers of \u03b1s is impaired, and the logarithms\nmust be resummed.\nFor vector boson production in hadronic collisions between hadrons hA and hB , hA +hB \u2192\nV (M) + X with V = \u03b3 \u2217 , W \u00b1 , or Z 0 , the CSS resummation formalism yields the following\ngeneric form [9]:\nd\u03c3(hA + hB \u2192 V + X)\n1\n=\n2\n2\ndM dy dpT\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nZ\n\n~\n\nd2 b\u0303 ei~pT *b\u0303 W\u0303 (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) + Y (pT , M, xA , xB ) ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere xA = ey M/ s and xB = e\u2212y M/ s, with rapidity y and collision energy s. In\nEq. (1), the W\u0303 term dominates the pT distributions when pT \u226a M, and the Y term gives\ncorrections that are negligible for small pT , but become important when pT \u223c M. In the\nCSS formalism, the function W\u0303 appears as a superposition,\n\n5\n\n\fW\u0303 (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) =\n\nX\n\nW\u0303ij (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) \u03c3ij\u2192V (M) ,\n\n(2)\n\nij\n\nwhere \u03c3ij\u2192V (M) is the lowest order cross section for a quark-antiquark pair of invariant\nmass M to annihilate into a vector boson V , and the\n\nP\n\nij\n\nruns over all possible quark and\n\nantiquark flavors that can annihilate into the vector boson at the Born level [9]. In Eq. (2),\nW\u0303ij (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) is an effective flux to have partons of flavor i and j from the respective\nhadrons hA and hB , and it has the form\nW\u0303ij (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) = eS(b\u0303,M ) w\u0303ij (b\u0303, c/b\u0303, xA , xB ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere S(b\u0303, M) is given in the Appendix, and c is a constant of order unity [9,10]. The\nfunctions w\u0303ij (b\u0303, c/b\u0303, xA , xB ) in Eq. (3) depend on only one momentum scale, 1/b\u0303, and\nare perturbatively calculable as long as 1/b\u0303 is large enough. All large logarithms from\nln(1/b\u03032 ) to ln(M 2 ) in W\u0303ij (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) are completely resummed into the exponential factor exp[S(b\u0303, M)].\nSince the perturbatively resummed W\u0303ij (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) in Eq. (3) is only reliable for the\nsmall b\u0303 region, an extrapolation to the large b\u0303 region is necessary in order to complete\nthe Fourier transform in Eq. (1). This is the point where the dependence of the result on\nthe nonperturbative parameters enters into the formalism, possibly limiting the predicative\npower of pQCD , especially for small pT . We will next discuss this in detail.\n\nB. Improved extrapolation formula with power corrections\n\nThe CSS formalism in its original form introduces a modification to the output of the\nperturbative calculation (see Appendix, Eq. (25)). The size of the modification depends\non the non-perturbative input parameters, and can be as large as 50% of the perturbative\nresult. Therefore the predictive power of the CSS formalism was questioned and new efforts\nhave been devoted to resum the large logarithms directly in pT space [14,15].\nIn oder to improve the predictive power of the CSS b\u0303-space resummation formalism,\nthe following new form was proposed [10] by solving the renormalization group equation\n6\n\n\fincluding power corrections:\n\nW\u0303 (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 W\u0303 (b\u0303, M, x\n\nA , xB )\n\nb\u0303 \u2264 b\u0303max\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 W\u0303 (b\u0303max , M, xA , xB ) F N P (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ; b\u0303max , \u03b1)\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nb\u0303 > b\u0303max\n\nwhere the nonperturbative function F N P in Eq. (4) is given by\nF\n\nNP\n\n(b\u0303, M, xA , xB ; b\u0303max , \u03b1) = exp\n\n(\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011i\nM 2 b\u03032max h \u0010 2 \u03b1\n2\n\u03b1\n2\n2\n\u2212 ln\n+\ng\ng\n(\nb\u0303\n)\n\u2212\n(\nb\u0303\n)\nb\u0303\n\u2212\nb\u0303\n2\n1\nmax\nmax\nc2\n!\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2212 \u1e212 b\u03032 \u2212 b\u03032max\n\n\u0011\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nIn Eq. (4) b\u0303max is a parameter to separate the perturbatively calculated part from the\nnon-perturbative input. Unlike in the original CSS formalism, when b\u0303 \u2264 b\u0303max , the perturbatively calculated W\u0303 (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) is not altered and is independent of the nonperturbative\nparameters. In addition, the b\u0303-dependence in Eq. (5) is separated according to different\nphysics origins. The (b\u03032 )\u03b1 -dependence mimics the summation of the perturbatively calculable leading power contributions to the kernels K and G in Eq.s (13) and (14) of the\nAppendix, respectively, to all orders in the running coupling constant \u03b1s (\u03bc) with the scale\n\u03bc running into the nonperturbative region [16]. The b\u03032 -dependence of the g2 term is a direct\nconsequence of dynamical power corrections to the renormalization group equations of the\nkernels K and G, and has an explicit dependence on M. The \u1e212 term represents the effect\nof the non-vanishing intrinsic parton transverse momentum. As we discuss later, these two\nterms behave differently in nuclear collisions.\nA remarkable feature of the b\u0303-space resummation formalism is that the resummed exponential factor exp[S(b\u0303, M)] (see Eq. (3)) suppresses the b\u0303-integral when b\u0303 is larger than\n1/M. Therefore, when M \u226b \u03bc0 , (where \u03bc0 \u223c 1/b\u0303max represents the scale at which pQCD\nstarts to be applicable), it is possible that the Fourier transform in Eq. (1) is dominated\nby a region of b\u0303 much smaller than 1/\u03bc0, and the calculated pT distributions are insensitive to the nonperturbative information at large b\u0303. In fact, it was shown using the saddle\npoint method that, for a large enough M, a QCD perturbation calculation is valid even\nat pT = 0 [17,9]. As discussed in Ref. [10], the value of the saddle point strongly depends\n7\n\n\f\u221a\n\ns, in addition to its well-known M 2 dependence. Because of the\n\u221a\nsteep evolution of parton distributions at small x, the s dependence of the W\u0303 in Eq. (1)\n\non the collision energy\n\nsignificantly decreases the value of the saddle point and improves the predictive power of\nthe b\u0303-space resummation formalism at collider energies.\nTo display the saddle point clearly, let us rewrite the first term on the right-hand side of\nEq. (1), taking into account that there is no preferred transverse direction and that W\u0303 in\nEq. (1) is a function of b\u0303 = |~b\u0303| only:\n1\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ni~\npT *~b\u0303\n\nd b\u0303 e\n\n1\nW\u0303 (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) =\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndb\u0303 b\u0303 J0 (pT b\u0303) W\u0303 (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere W\u0303 contains the exponential factor exp[S(b\u0303, M)], and J0 (z) with z = pT b\u0303 represents\nthe Bessel function of order zero. When pT > 0, the Bessel function suppresses the large\nb\u0303 region of the integration. Because the argument of the Bessel function is proportional to\npT , the large b\u0303 region is more suppressed if pT is larger. In the following, we focus on the\nsaddle point at pT = 0. Fig. 1 is a graph (on an arbitrary scale) of the integrand of the\nright hand side of Eq. (6) with pT = 0 for the case of Z 0 production at the collision energies\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere we intend to carry out our calculations: s = 350 GeV (dotted line), s = 500 GeV\n\u221a\n(short dashes), and at s = 5.5 TeV (solid). The position of the saddle point decreases\nas the collision energy increases. We will show that the predictive power of the formalism\nis very good at RHIC. As a consequence of the behavior of the saddle point position, we\n\u221a\n\u221a\nexpect excellent precision at s = 5.5 TeV. At the LHC pp energy of s = 14 TeV, the\nsaddle point moves to even smaller values of b\u0303, improving the accuracy of the calculation\neven further.\nThe parameters g1 and \u03b1 of Eq. (5) are fixed by the requirement of continuity of the\nfunction W\u0303 (b\u0303) and its derivative at b\u0303 = b\u0303max . (The results are insensitive to changes of b\u0303max\n< b\u0303max < 0.7 GeV\u22121 . We use b\u0303max = 0.5 GeV\u22121 in Ref. [10] and\nin the interval 0.3 GeV\u22121 \u223c\n\u223c\nhere.) The value of g2 and \u1e212 can be obtained by fitting the low-energy Drell-Yan data, and\nare taken to be \u1e212 \u223c 0.27 GeV2 , and g2 \u223c 0.01 GeV2 following Ref.s [10] and [18]. As the b\u0303\ndependence of the g2 and \u1e212 terms in Eq. (5) is identical, it is convenient to combine these\n8\n\n\fterms and define\nG2 = ln(\n\nM 2 b\u03032max\n)g2 + \u1e212 .\nc2\n\n(7)\n\nUsing the values of the parameters listed above, we get G2 \u223c 0.4 GeV2 for W \u00b1 and Z 0 production in pp collisions. The parameter G2 can be considered the only free parameter in the\nnon-perturbative input in Eq. (5), arising from the power corrections in the renormalization\ngroup equation. Our results are not sensitive to small variations of G2 around its estimated\nvalue. We use G2 = 0.4 GeV2 in the following. An impression about the importance of\npower corrections can be obtained by comparing results with G2 = 0.4 GeV2 to those with\npower corrections turned off (G2 = 0). We therefore define the ratio of these quantities:\nd\u03c3 (G2 ) (pT )\nRG2 (pT ) \u2261\ndpT\n\n,\n\nd\u03c3(pT )\n.\ndpT\n\n(8)\n\nThe cross sections in the above equation and in the results presented in this paper have\nbeen integrated over rapidity and invariant mass squared from Eq. (1). For the integration\nover dM 2 , we use the \"narrow width approximation\" [19]. With respect to rapidity, we\nintegrate over the interval [\u22121, 1] for RHIC, and over [-2.4,2.4] for LHC, representing the\ncentral acceptances of the appropriate detectors. For the parton distribution functions, we\nuse the CTEQ5M set [20] in the present work.\nThe following figures display differential cross sections and the corresponding RG2 ratios\nfor Z 0 and W \u00b1 production as functions of pT , in order of increasing energy. (In what follows,\nby W \u00b1 production cross section we mean the cross section for W + + W \u2212 .) In Fig. 2(a) we\n\u221a\nshow the differential cross section for Z 0 production in pp collisions at s = 500 GeV,\nwhere a RHIC pp run is expected. The accompanying Fig. 2(b) displays RG2 of Eq. (8). It\ncan be seen that the RG2 ratio converges to unity (i.e. very small power corrections) with\nincreasing pT , and the effect of power corrections is about five percent for pT = 0. However,\nwhen pT > 2 GeV, the deviation of RG2 from unity is under two percent. A very similar\nconclusion can be drawn from Fig. 3, concerning W \u00b1 production in pp collisions at the same\nenergy: the dependence on the nonperturbative input is weak even at the lowest transverse\nmomenta.\n9\n\n\fFig.-s 4 and 5 contain similar information for Z 0 and W \u00b1 production in pp collisions at\n\u221a\nthe planned LHC nucleus-nucleus collision energy of s = 5.5 TeV, while the cross section\n\u221a\nand RG2 are given for the LHC pp energy of s = 14 TeV in Fig.-s 6 and 7. At all energies,\nthe magnitude of the W \u00b1 production cross section is about 3 to 5 times that of the Z 0\nproduction cross section. Otherwise, the results for Z 0 and W \u00b1 production are very similar,\nbecause the saddle points are almost at the same place in b\u0303 space in the two cases. As it has\nbeen pointed out in Ref [10], the position of the saddle point is determined by two terms:\nthe first term is inversely proportional to the mass of the vector boson, and the second term\nis proportional to the derivative of the parton distribution function with respect to the scale\nat xA or xB . At the collider energies considered here, the second term is negative. While\nMW is a little smaller than MZ , and thus the first term is larger for W \u00b1 than for Z 0 , the\ncontribution from the second term will effect the saddle point for W \u00b1 more than that of the\nZ 0 with a small xA and xB .\nAs expected from Fig. 1, the dependence on the nonperturbative input decreases with\nincreasing collision energy. The RG2 ratio is smaller than one percent at LHC for both\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns = 5.5 TeV and s = 14 TeV, even when pT = 0. These results confirm that the\npredictive power of the formalism is very good at RHIC and excellent at LHC. They also\nshow that the effect of power corrections is very small at LHC for almost the whole pT region\nand it is also negligible for RHIC when pT is larger than 2 GeV.\n\nIII. ISOSPIN AND SHADOWING EFFECTS IN NUCLEAR COLLISIONS\n\nIn lack of nuclear effects on the hard collision, the production of heavy vector bosons in\nnucleus-nucleus (AB) collisions should scale, compared to the production in pp collisions,\nas the number of hard collisions, AB. However, there are several nuclear effects on the\nhard collision in a heavy-ion reaction. We distinguish three categories of these effects:\nisospin effects, the modification of the parton distribution function in the nucleus, and the\nenhancement of power corrections by the nuclear size. In this Section we discuss the first\n10\n\n\ftwo of these nuclear effects. Power corrections will be treated separately in the next Section.\nAs the parton distribution of neutrons is different from that of the protons, the production\ncross section of heavy vector bosons in proton-neutron and neutron-neutron interactions\ndiffers from the corresponding production cross section in pp collisions. This difference is\nthe source of the so-called isospin effects. To study the isospin effects, let us introduce\nd\u03c3(pT , ZA /A, ZB /B)\nRiso (pT ) \u2261\ndpT\n\n,\n\nd\u03c3(pT )\n,\ndpT\n\n(9)\n\nwhere ZA and ZB are the atomic numbers and A and B are the mass numbers of the colliding\nnuclei, and the cross section d\u03c3(pT , ZA /A, ZB /B)/dpT has been averaged over AB, while\nd\u03c3(pT )/dpT is the pp cross section (with G2 = 0). Since the u\u016b coupling in Z 0 production\nis replaced by ud \u0304 coupling to produce W \u00b1 bosons, we expect Riso to be complementary for\nW \u00b1 and Z 0 production, i.e. if one of these ratios is larger than one, the other ratio should\nbe smaller than unity.\nNext we turn to the phenomenon of shadowing. We use the term shadowing in the general\nsense, referring to all modifications of the parton distribution function in the environment\nof the nucleus [13]. This includes, in different regions of x, the phenomena of shadowing (in\nthe strict sense), anti-shadowing, and the EMC effect. It is also important to note that we\ndefine shadowing effects as leading twist effects, not including power corrections [11]. Thus,\nshadowing effects and power correction are clearly separated in the present work.\nIn general, shadowing is expected to be a function of x, the scale Q, and of the position\nin the nucleus. The latter dependence means that in heavy-ion collisions, shadowing should\nbe impact parameter (b) dependent. The parameterizations of shadowing in the literature\ntake into account some of these effects, but no complete parameterization exists to date\nto our knowledge. For example, the HIJING parameterization includes impact parameter\ndependence, but does not deal with the scale dependence [21,22]. On the other hand, the\nEKS98 [23] and HKM [24] parameterizations have a scale dependence, but do not consider\nimpact parameter dependence. (The latter parameterizations have been compared recently\n[25].) Since in this paper we concentrate on impact-parameter integrated results, where\n11\n\n\fthe effect of the b-dependence of shadowing is relatively unimportant [5], and we focus\nmore attention on scale dependence, we find the EKS98 shadowing parameterization most\nappropriate for our present purposes. Therefore we use EKS98 shadowing [23] in this work.\nSimilarly to Eq. (9) for isospin effects, we define a shadowing ratio,\nd\u03c3 (sh) (pT , ZA /A, ZB /B)\nRsh (pT ) \u2261\ndpT\n\n,\n\nd\u03c3(pT )\n.\ndpT\n\n(10)\n\nThus, Rsh incorporates the effects of both shadowing and the isospin composition of the\nnuclei. Furthermore, in this Section we take G2 = 0 throughout, switching off power corrections. The enhanced power corrections in pA and AB collisions will be discussed separately\nin the next Section.\nFig. 8 displays Riso (dashed lines) and Rsh (full lines) as functions of pT for Z 0 production\n\u221a\n(Fig. 8(a)) and W \u00b1 production (Fig. 8(b)), respectively, at s = 350 MeV. The same\n\u221a\ninformation is presented at s = 5.5 TeV in Fig. 9. We find that Riso > 1 for Z 0 production\nand Riso < 1 for W \u00b1 production at both energies, complementing each other, as expected.\nHow close Riso is to unity depends on the region of x that has the dominant contribution to\nthe cross section. At LHC, x \u223c 0.02, and the magnitude of the isospin effects is about 2%.\n \u0304\nThis is because when x is in this range, the difference of the distributions of u(\u016b) and d(d)\nquarks in the nucleus is very small. At RHIC, where the dominant x \u223c 0.26, the isospin\neffects are about 20% in the small pT region. We have also checked that the scale dependence\nof isospin effects is not important. In Fig. 8, we also show a dotted line, which is the ratio\nof Rsh to Riso , and thus can be considered to display the effect of \"pure shadowing\". Pure\nshadowing appears as an approximately constant reduction of 3-5% at x \u223c 0.26.\n\u221a\nThe appearance of Rsh (full lines) is more surprising at s = 5.5 TeV (Fig. 9). Since\nat LHC, even at pT = 90 GeV, x \u223c 0.05, we are still in the \"strict shadowing\" region.\n< pT < 70 GeV is not \"antishadowing\"; rather,\nTherefore, the fact that Rsh > 1 for 20 GeV \u223c\n\u223c\nit is a consequence of the change of the shape of the cross section from pp to AB reactions.\nIn pp collisions, the maximum of the cross section is at pT \u2248 3.7 GeV. In AB collisions, the\npeak is shifted by about 0.4 GeV in the direction of large transverse momenta. On the other\n12\n\n\fhand, the contributions from the scale \u03bc \u223c pT to M have been resummed. Resummation\nplays a more important role for small pT than for large pT . In EKS98, the strict shadowing\neffect is more important for small scales, such as pT \u223c 2 \u2212 5 GeV, than for pT \u223c M. Thus,\na relatively small shift in the peak position brings about the rise of Rsh above unity. The\nshadowing ratio Rsh dips below one again at a certain pT , to approach the fixed-order pQCD\nresult when pT \u223c M. The situation in Fig. 9 can be understood by noting that shadowing in\nthe resummed transverse momentum distributions is sensitive to the scale used to describe\nthe nuclear effects on the parton distribution function.\nAfter this discussion one may want to revisit Fig. 8 and ask why is Rsh flat at RHIC\nenergies. The answer lies in the observation that the EMC region of x dominates the cross\n\u221a\nsection at s = 350 MeV. There is no sensitivity to the scale in that region in EKS98.\nIn summary, the shadowing effects in the pT distribution of heavy bosons at RHIC and\nLHC are sensitive to the scale of the nuclear parton distribution. The available data on the\nscale dependence of nuclear parton distribution functions are very limited [23]. Theoretical\nstudies (such as EKS98) are based on the the assumption that the nuclear parton distribution\nfunctions differ from the parton distributions in the free proton, but obey the same DGLAP\nevolution [23]. Therefore, the tranverse momentum distribution of heavy bosons at LHC\nin P b + P b collisions can provide a further test of our understanding of the nuclear parton\ndistributions.\n\nIV. ENHANCED POWER CORRECTIONS IN NUCLEAR COLLISIONS\n\nWe have seen in Section II that the effect of power corrections on the resummed cross\nsection is very weak in pp collisions at both RHIC and LHC. In pA and AB collisions, power\ncorrections will be enhanced due to rescattering in the nucleus. In this Section we discuss\nthe enhancement of power corrections in nuclear collisions.\nAs \u1e212 represents the effect of the partons' non-vanishing intrinsic transverse momentum,\nit should not have a strong nuclear dependence. On the other hand, g2 arises as a result of\n13\n\n\fdynamical power corrections, and should be enhanced by the nuclear size, i.e. proportional\nto A1/3 . Considering the enhancement, we get G2 \u223c 0.8 GeV2 for p + Au and G2 \u223c 1.5\nGeV2 for P b + P b reactions.\nsh\nIn order to study the effects of power corrections, we now define RG\nin nuclear collision\n2\n\nas follows:\nsh\nRG\n(pT )\n2\n\nd\u03c3 (G2 ,sh) (pT , ZA /A, ZB /B)\n\u2261\ndpT\n\n,\n\nd\u03c3 (sh) (pT , ZA /A, ZB /B)\n,\ndpT\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the numerator represents the result of the full calculation, with isospin effects, shadowing, and power corrections taken into account, and the denominator was introduced in\nconnection with Eq. (10) and contains no power corrections (G2 = 0).\nFig.10(a) and Fig.11(a) present the d\u03c3 (G2 ,sh)(pT , ZA /A, ZB /B) for W \u00b1 production at\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns = 350 GeV in p + Au reactions and s = 5.5 TeV in P b + P b collisions, respectively.\nsh\nIn Fig. 10(b) the solid line is RG\nin p + Au collisions and the dashed line is RG2 in pp\n2\nsh\ncollisions at the same energy. At pT \u223c 0 GeV, RG\nis about 0.88, in contrast to about 0.95\n2\n\nin pp collisions. The effects of power corrections are enhanced about three times in p + Au\ncollision relative to pp collisions. However, even for pT \u223c 0, the effect of power corrections is\nonly about 10%, and for pT > 2 GeV, the effect remains under 5%. Thus the effect of power\ncorrections is weak in p + Au collisions at RHIC. As for the situation at LHC in P b + P b\ncollisions, displayed in Fig. 11, the effects of power corrections appear to be enhanced by a\nsimilar factor (about three) from pp to P b + P b collisions at LHC. The reason for the similar\nenhancement is the interplay of the higher energy and the larger value of G2 mentioned\nabove. In any case, the enhanced power corrections remain under 3% in the [0,80] GeV pT\ninterval for P b + P b at LHC. The results for Z 0 production are similar to those for W \u00b1\nproduction.\n\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nWe have demonstrated that the predictive power of a resummed pQCD calculation for\nheavy boson production is very good at RHIC and excellent at LHC, because the depen14\n\n\fdence of the cross sections on the non-perturbative input is weak. This makes W \u00b1 and Z 0\nproduction reliably calculable at the energies considered. On the experimental side, W \u00b1\nand Z 0 production should be an early observable at LHC (with sufficiently high production\nrates) in both pp and nuclear collisions. At RHIC, production rates may remain on the\nlow side, in particular in pp collisions. In all cases, the cross sections peak at relatively low\ntransverse momenta, and we calculate the peak position for all systems considered.\nWe have examined the effects of the isospin composition of nuclei and of shadowing\nin nuclear collisions. We find that isospin effects are modest in W \u00b1 and Z 0 production\nat the energies considered, while shadowing is relatively unimportant at RHIC, but plays\nan important role at LHC in shaping the transverse momentum distributions. This comes\nabout because of the sensitivity of shadowing effects to the scale of the parton distribution\nfunctions. We also studied the magnitude of power corrections in pp and nuclear collisions.\nPower corrections are small in pp collisions, and, even though part of these corrections is\nenhanced in nuclear collisions by a factor of A1/3 , they remain below 10% (even at very low\ntransverse momenta) in AB reactions.\nAs indicated by the above observations, the resummed pQCD formalism yields accurate\nresults for W \u00b1 and Z 0 transverse momentum distributions at RHIC and LHC. The production of heavy bosons can therefore serve as a further test of the nuclear parton distributions.\nIn more general terms, W \u00b1 and Z 0 production at RHIC and LHC provides a bench mark\ntest of resummed pQCD for pp and nuclear collisions at these energies. We hope that our\npredictions will soon be compared to data.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank T. Hallman, D. Keane, and R.

APPENDIX\n\nHere we summarize relevant details of the CSS formalism concerning the structure of\nthe terms in Eq. (1). We address, in particular, the construction of the exponential factor\nexp[S(b\u0303, M)] in Eq. (3).\nIt was shown in Ref. [9] that for b\u0303 \u226a 1/\u039bQCD , the function W\u0303 (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) of Eq. (1)\nis directly related to the singular parts of the pT distribution as pT \u2192 0. More precisely,\nW\u0303 (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) includes all singular terms like \u03b4 2 (~pT ) and [lnm (p2 /p2T )/p2T ]reg with m \u2265 0.\nLess singular terms as pT \u2192 0 are included in the Y term of Eq. (1). The QCD resummation\nof the large logarithms in the CSS formalism is achieved by solving the evolution equation\nfor the W\u0303ij of Eq. (2),\nh\ni\n\u2202\nW\u0303\n(\nb\u0303,\nM,\nx\n,\nx\n)\n=\nK(\nb\u0303\u03bc,\n\u03b1\n(\u03bc))\n+\nG(M/\u03bc,\n\u03b1\n(\u03bc))\nW\u0303ij (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) ,\nij\nA\nB\ns\ns\n\u2202 ln M 2\n\n(12)\n\nand the corresponding renormalization group equations for the kernels K and G,\n1\n\u2202\nK(b\u0303\u03bc, \u03b1s (\u03bc)) = \u2212 \u03b3K (\u03b1s (\u03bc)) ,\n2\n\u2202 ln \u03bc\n2\n\u2202\n1\nG(M/\u03bc, \u03b1s (\u03bc)) = \u03b3K (\u03b1s (\u03bc)) .\n2\n\u2202 ln \u03bc\n2\nThe anomalous dimension \u03b3K (\u03b1s (\u03bc)) =\n\nP\n\n(n)\nn\nn=1 \u03b3K (\u03b1s (\u03bc)/\u03c0)\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nin Eqs.

The functions A and B do not have large logarithms and have perturbative\nexpansions A =\n\nP\n\nn=1\n\nA(n) (\u03b1s /\u03c0)n and B =\n\nP\n\nn=1\n\nB (n) (\u03b1s /\u03c0)n , respectively.

The coefficients A and B given in Eq. (17) are\nderived from the general expressions in Ref. [9] with renormalization constant c = 2e\u2212\u03b3E ,\nwhere \u03b3E \u2248 0.577 is Euler's constant [8].\nSubstituting Eq. (16) into Eq. (12), and integrating from ln(c2 /b\u03032 ) to ln(M 2 ), one obtains\nthe W\u0303ij given in Eq.

(3), all large logarithms from ln(c2 /b\u03032 ) to ln(M 2 ) in W\u0303ij (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) are completely\nresummed into the exponential factor exp[S(b\u0303, M)], leaving the w\u0303ij (b\u0303, c/b\u0303, xA , xB ) with only\none momentum scale 1/b\u0303. The w\u0303ij (b\u0303, c/b\u0303, xA , xB ) in Eq. (3) is then perturbatively calculable\nwhen the momentum scale 1/b\u0303 is large enough, and is given by [9,14]\nw\u0303ij (b\u0303, c/b\u0303, xA , xB ) = fi/A (xA , \u03bc = c/b\u0303) fj/B (xB , \u03bc = c/b\u0303) .\nThe functions fi/A and fj/B are the modified parton distributions [9,14],\n17\n\n(19)\n\n\ffi/A (xA , \u03bc) =\n\nXZ\na\n\nwhere\n\nP\n\na\n\n1\n\nxA\n\nd\u03be\nCi/a (xA /\u03be, \u03bc)) \u03c6a/A (\u03be, \u03bc) ,\n\u03be\n\n(20)\n\nruns over all parton flavors. In Eq. (20), \u03c6a/A (\u03be, \u03bc) is the normal parton dis-\n\ntribution for finding a parton of flavor a in hadron A, and Ci/a =\n\nP\n\nn=0\n\n(n)\n\nCi/a (\u03b1s /\u03c0)n are\n\nperturbatively calculable coefficient functions for finding a parton i in the modified parton\ndistribution fi/A (xA , \u03bc) from a parton a in the normal parton distribution \u03c6a/A (\u03be, \u03bc). The\nfirst two coefficients of the Ci/a are available [9,26]:\n(0)\n\nCi/j (z, \u03bc = c/b\u0303) = \u03b4ij \u03b4(z \u2212 1) ,\n(0)\n\nCi/g (z, \u03bc = c/b\u0303) = 0 ,\n(1)\nCi/j (z, \u03bc\n\n\u03c02\nCF\n(1 \u2212 z) +\n\u2212 4 \u03b4(1 \u2212 z) ,\n= c/b\u0303) = \u03b4ij\n2\n2\n\"\n\n!\n\n#\n\n(1)\n\nCi/g (z, \u03bc = c/b\u0303) = TR z (1 \u2212 z) ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere i and j represent quark or antiquark flavors and g represents a gluon. The coefficient\nfunctions given in Eq. (21) are derived from the general functional forms in Ref. [9] by setting\nthe renormalization constants and the factorization scale as, C1 = c, C2 = 1, and \u03bc = c/b\u0303.\nThe \u03c3ij\u2192V (M) in Eq. (2) is the lowest order cross section for a quark-antiquark pair to\nannihilate into the vector boson (V = \u03b3 \u2217 , W \u00b1 , or Z 0 ). For V = Z 0 , we have [8]\n\u03c3ij\u2192Z 0 (MZ ) = Qij\n\n2\n4\u03c0 3 \u03b1EM\n(Mz )\n3s\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere Qij is the weak charge,\n[1 \u2212 4|eq |sin2 \u03b8W ]2 + 1\nQij =\n,\n16 sin2 \u03b8W cos2 \u03b8W\n\n(23)\n\nwith \u03b8W denoting the Weinberg angle and eq denoting the charge of the quark. Here, i and\nj must represent a quark-antiquark pair of the same flavor. For the Weinberg angle we use\nsin2 \u03b8W = 0.23. The \u03c3ij\u2192V (M) for V = W \u00b1 and \u03b3 \u2217 can be found in Refs. [9,14].\nIn the CSS resummation formalism, the Y term in Eq. (1) represents a small correction\nto the pT distribution when pT \u226a M. However, the Y term dominates the pT -distributions\nwhen pT \u223c M. The Y term has the perturbative expansion Y =\nthe coefficients Y (n) have the factorized form [9]\n18\n\nP\n\nn=1\n\nY (n) (\u03b1s (\u03bc)/\u03c0)n , and\n\n\fY\n\n(n)\n\n(pT , M, xA , xB ; \u03bc) =\n\nXZ\na,b\n\n\u00d7\nwhere\n\nP\n\na,b\n\n1\n\nxA\n\nd\u03beA\n\u03c6a/A (\u03beA , \u03bc)\n\u03beA\n\n2\n4\u03c0 3 \u03b1EM\n(Mz )\n3s\n\n!\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nxB\n\nd\u03beB\n\u03c6b/B (\u03beB , \u03bc)\n\u03beB\n\n(n)\n\nRab\u2192V (pT , M, xA /\u03beA , xB /\u03beB ; \u03bc) ,\n\n(24)\n\nruns over all possible parton flavors and \u03bc represents both the factorization and\n(n)\n\nrenormalization scales. The Rab\u2192V in Eq. (24) are perturbatively calculable and have the\nsame normalization as those introduced in Ref. [9].\nSince the perturbatively resummed W\u0303ij (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) in Eq. (3) is only reliable for the\nsmall b\u0303 region, an extrapolation to the large b\u0303 region is necessary in order to complete the\nFourier transform in Eq. (1). In the original CSS formalism, a variable b\u0303\u2217 and a nonperturNP\nbative function FCSS\n(b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) were introduced [9] in such a way that W\u0303 was modified\n\nfor all b\u0303 (except b\u0303 = 0) as\nNP\nW\u0303 CSS (b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) \u2261 W\u0303 (b\u0303\u2217 , M, xA , xB ) FCSS\n(b\u0303, M, xA , xB ) ,\n\n(25)\n\nq\n\nwhere b\u0303\u2217 = b\u0303/ 1 + (b\u0303/b\u0303max )2 , with b\u0303max = 0.5 GeV\u22121 . This construction ensures that\nNP\nNP\nb\u0303\u2217 \u2264 b\u0303max for all values of b\u0303. The function FCSS\nis a Gaussian in b\u0303, FCSS\n\u223c exp(\u2212\u03bab\u03032 ) with\n\n\u03ba having a certain M 2 , xA , and xB dependence [9].\nAs it has been pointed out in this paper and earlier [10], the original CSS extrapolation\nintroduces a modification to the perturbative calculation, and the size of the modifications\nNP\ndepends on the non-perturbative parameters in FCSS\n(b\u0303, M, xA , xB ). This motivated the\n\ndevelopment of the alternative extrapolation formula [10] used in the present work.\n\n19\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] Proceedings\n\nof\n\nQuark\n\nMatter\n\n2001,\n\nNucl.\n\nPhys.\n\nA\n\n698,\n\n1\n\n(2002);\n\nhttp://www.rhic.bnl.gov/qm2001.\n[2] C.
