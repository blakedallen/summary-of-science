This result\nwas much later confirmed by microscopic approaches\n[5, 7, 8, 9, 10] and became known as the Nyquist spectrum. Nearly twenty years later Brillouin [2] applied the\nsecond law to analyze a circuit containing rectifying elements. Another formulation of the second law, the Clausius inequality, was considered in the context of electric\ncircuits by Landauer [3]. The equilibrium thermodynamics of linear and non-linear circuits was thoroughly analyzed by Stratonovich [5]. Further research in this field\nwas stimulated by two facts: first, by the technical importance of circuits in electronics, and second by their\nfeasibility, which allows to create experimental conditions\nclose to those in theory [6].\nIn view of these successful applications of thermodynamics, one naturally expects that electrical circuits can\nplay also a complementary role by acting as experimental and theoretical laboratories for testing new ideas and\nresults in statistical thermodynamics itself. The present\npaper makes such an attempt in the context of our recent discussion of the applicability of the second law to\nquantum systems coupled to thermal baths [11, 12]. The\ngeneral philosophy of the approach is that thermodynamic relations are not introduced axiomatically or phenomenologically, but should be derived from first principles, namely the laws of quantum mechanics. For linear\nsystems, e.g. a set of harmonically bounded Brownian\nparticle interacting with a quantum thermal bath, this\nprogram can be carried out exactly. As the main result\nwe were able to check some formulations of the second\nlaw, whose validity in the classical domain was numerously confirmed via analogous approaches [3, 4, 5]. One\nof these formulations, the Clausius inequality, appeared\nto be broken in the low temperature quantum regime.\nHere we reformulate this result for a quantum linear RLC\n\ncircuit [7, 8, 13]. Our purpose is rather straightforward:\nwe explain that the above violation can be detected experimentally in low temperature mesoscopic circuits. To\nthis end we analyze some known experimental results and\nshow that several important parts of our proposal were\nalready realized in experiment.\nOur plan for the present paper is following. In section\n2 we will briefly describe the quantum RLC circuit coupled with a thermal bath. We continue with explanation\nof the Clausius inequality in section 3. In the following section we analyze some experimental results, and\nin their context we make quantitative estimates for our\neffect. Our conclusions are presented in the last section.\n2.\nRLC CIRCUIT AND ITS\nHEISENBERG-LANGEVIN EQUATIONS\n1.\n\nClassical RLC circuit\n\nThe classical scheme of the simplest RLC circuit is\nwell-known. It consist of capacity C, inductivity L and\nresistance R. The loss of voltage across the resistance is\ngiven by the Ohm law: IR, where I = dQ/dt is the current, and Q stands for the charge. The capacitor enters\nthe total voltage as Q/C. Finally, the inductive element\ninduces a magnetic field with the flux \u03a6 = LI, which in\nturn contributes to the voltage (Faraday's law). Altogether, one finally obtains:\nQ\u0307 =\n\n\u03a6\n,\nL\n\n\u03a6\u0307 = \u2212\n\nQ R\n\u2212 \u03a6.\nC\nL\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe first equation is just the definition of the current,\nand the second one expresses the fact that the total voltage in the closed circuit is zero. Apart from the term\nconnected with the resistance, Eqs. (2.1) can be viewed\nas the canonical equation of motion generated by the\nHamiltonian\nHS =\n\n\u03a62\nQ2\n+\n,\n2L 2C\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere Q and \u03a6 are the canonical coordinate and momentum. Within the language of Brownian motion the\n\n\f2\ncontribution of the resistance in Eq. (2.1) corresponds to\nthe Ohmic friction with the damping coefficient R. In\nthe same context C corresponds to the inverse strength\nof the external harmonic potential, and L corresponds to\nthe mass of the Brownian particle.\n\n2.\n\nQuantum RLC circuit\n\nEq. (2.2) makes obvious that for R = 0 one can quantize the model regarding \u03a6 and Q as the corresponding\noperators:\n[Q, \u03a6] = i~.\n\n1\nK(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = h\u03b7(t)\u03b7(t\u2032 ) + \u03b7(t\u2032 )\u03b7(t)i\n(2.6)\n2\n\u0001\nZ \u221e\n\u03c9 coth 21 \u03b2~\u03c9\n~R\ncos \u03c9(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\nd\u03c9\n=\n\u03c0 0\n1 + (\u03c9/\u0393)2\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/kB T , and we use units in which Boltzmann's constant kB = 1.\nIf \u0393 is much larger than other frequencies of the problem (this is the most typical situation), then for t > 0 one\ncan get the Langevin equation (2.5) in a more standard\nform:\n\n(2.3)\n\nThen Eqs. (2.1) are just the Heisenberg equations of the\nproblem. The quantum description for electrical circuits\nbecame necessary at the beginning of 1980's with the\nappearance of gravitational wave-measuring setups and\nJosephson junctions. These devices operate at low temperatures and are very susceptible to their environment,\nso that both the circuit and its photonic thermal bath\nhave to be described quantum-mechanically. Since then\nthe problem of quantization for the electrical circuits was\nconsidered in numerous contributions (see e.g. [7, 8, 13])\nwith special emphasis on the dissipative aspects of the\nproblem. More recently the interest in this subject was\nrenewed in the context of low-temperature mesoscopic\ncircuits [16, 17]. Though within the classical approach\nthe resistivity can be introduced phenomenologically, this\nis impossible for the quantum case, in particular because it will violate the Heisenberg relation. The cause\nis that even if Eq. (2.3) is valid at the initial moment, a\nnon-Hamiltonian dynamics does not conserve it in time.\nThus, the dissipative quantum situation should be investigated starting from a more fundamental level, i.e.\nby explicitly describing the thermal bath. The strategy\nhere is exactly the same as when studying the dynamics\nof open quantum systems in general [9]: One models the\nresistance as an open chain of linear LC circuits (thermal\nbath) attached to the studied circuit, and then applies\nthe standard canonical quantization scheme to the whole\nclosed Hamiltonian system. In a second step one traces\nout the bath, since only the degrees of freedom of the\ninitial circuit are considered to be observable. Since the\nbath consists of harmonic oscillators, this procedure can\nbe realized explicitly. Omitting technicalities which can\nbe found in [7, 8, 9, 11], we will write down the final\nquantum Langevin equations\n\u03a6\n,\n(2.4)\nL\nZ t\nQ\nds e\u2212\u0393(t\u2212s) Q\u0307(s) + \u03b7(t)\n\u03a6\u0307 = \u2212 \u2212 R \u0393\nC\n0\n\nQ\u0307 =\n\n\u2212R \u0393 e\u2212\u0393t Q(0),\n\nthe Nyquist spectrum:\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere \u0393 is the maximal frequency of the bath, and where\n\u03b7(t) is the quantum Gaussian noise (random e.m.f.) with\n\n\u03a6\u0307 = \u2212\n\nQ(t)\n\u2212 R I(t) + \u03b7(t).\nC\n\n(2.7)\n\nIn the classical limit (large T ) the spectrum (2.6) would\nbecome the Nyquist white noise spectrum\n\u2032\n\nK(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = RT \u0393e\u2212\u0393|t\u2212t | \u2248 2RT \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ),\n\n(2.8)\n\nbut that regime will not be of our concern. Though in\nthe classical situation the noise can be omitted at T = 0,\nfor the quantum case the presence of a resistivity without\nthe corresponding noise is excluded.\nGenerally, one should keep the parameter \u0393 in Eq. (2.6)\nfor the noise correlation function, since otherwise some\ndivergences will occur. However, provided that \u0393 is large\nthe concrete form of the cutoff function (here taken to be\nLorentzian) is not essential [9, 11].\n3.\n\nStationary state of the circuit\n\nEq. (2.7) is linear, and can be solved exactly. We will\nnot repeat the derivation of this solution, since it was\nthoroughly investigated in [9, 11]. Starting from any\ninitial state the circuits relaxes to its stationary state,\nwhere \u03a6 and Q are independent random Gaussian quantities with zero averages: h\u03a6i = hQi = 0, and have the\nfollowing dispersions [7]\nZ\n\u03c9 2 k(\u03c9)\nd\u03c9\n2\n,\nh\u03a6 i =\n2\u03c0 (1 + \u03c9 2 /\u03932 )[ (\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c902 ) 2 + \u03c9 2 R2 /L2 ]\nZ\nd\u03c9\nk(\u03c9)\nhQ2 i =\n,\n(2.9)\n2\u03c0 (\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c902 )2 L2 + \u03c9 2 R2\n~\u03c9\nk(\u03c9) = ~R \u03c9 coth ,\n2T\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c90 = 1/ LC is the frequency of the free circuit.\nStatistically these variables are independent, which is expressed by the relation hQ\u03a6+\u03a6Qi = 0. Explicit formulas\nexpressing hQ2 i and h\u03a62 i in terms of di-gamma functions,\nare given in [11, 12].\nThe disorder present in the circuit is characterized by\nthe occupied phase-space volume\nr\nh\u03a62 ihQ2 i\n\u2206\u03a6\u2206Q\n.\n(2.10)\n\u2261\n\u03a3=\n~\n~2\n\n\f3\nThe lower bound \u03a3 = 12 follows from the Heisenberg\nrelation \u2206\u03a6\u2206Q \u2265 21 ~. It means that the charge and the\nflux fluctuate close to their average values.\nIt is important to notice that in general the dispersions\nare not equal to their Gibbsian values:\n1\n1\nL ~\u03c90 tanh \u03b2~\u03c90 ,\n2\n2\n1\n1\nhQ2 iG = C ~\u03c90 tanh \u03b2~\u03c90 ,\n2\n2\n\nh\u03a62 iG =\n\n(2.11)\n\nwhich are obtained by assuming a Gibbs distribution for\nthe circuit, valid for a weak coupling with the bath, i.e.\nwhen taking R \u2192 0. That is why h\u03a62 iG and hQ2 iG do\nnot contain the resistance R anymore, in contrast to the\ngeneral expressions for h\u03a62 i and hQ2 i, presented above.\nIt is natural to identify the average energy stored in\nthe circuit with\nU \u2261 hHS i =\n\nh\u03a62 i hQ2 i\n+\n.\n2L\n2C\n\n(2.12)\n2\n\nThere is a general argument why the dispersions h\u03a6 i\nand hQ2 i are not equal to their Gibbsian values [11, 12].\nFor T \u2192 0 the Gibbs distribution predicts that the circuit is in the ground state of its Hamiltonian HS . Indeed,\nit can be checked that when values (2.11) are inserted\ninto (2.12), one gets U = 12 ~\u03c90 , just the exact ground\nstate energy of the free (i.e. R = 0) circuit. In quantum mechanics two interacting system are typically not\nin pure states, even though the overall state of the total system may be pure. This is the intriguing property\nof quantum entanglement. Thus, we should not expect\nthat a quantum circuit interacting non-weakly with its\nlow temperature bath will be found in a pure state. The\napproximate equalities h\u03a62 i \u2248 h\u03a62 iG , hQ2 i \u2248 hQ2 iG are\nvalid only for two particular cases: the weak-coupling situation, where in (2.9) one takes R \u2192 0, and the classical\ncase ~/T \u2192 0, where the temperature of the bath is so\nhigh that all signs of the quantum effects disappear. In\nboth these situations the entanglement is very weak.\n3.\n\nCLAUSIUS INEQUALITY\n\nLet one of the parameters of the circuit (e.g. the inductivity L) be varied by an external source from L to L+dL,\nin a certain time interval. The variation is assumed to\nbe very slow, so that at any moment the distributions\nof the flux and the charge are still given by (2.9) with\nthe instantaneous inductance L = L(t). The variation\nitself is a accompanied by the work done by the external\nsource. A part of that work is stored in the circuit, and\nthe rest is transferred to the bath as heat. The energy\nbudget of the variation is given by the first law:\n\u001d\n\u001c\nh\u03a62 i\nd\u0304W d\u0304Q\nd\u0304W\n\u2202HS\ndU\n= \u2212 2 , (3.1)\n=\n+\n,\n=\ndL\ndL\ndL\ndL\n\u2202L\n2L\nwhere dU is the change of the energy stored in the circuit,\nd\u0304W is the work done by external source on the system,\n\nand the difference between them, the heat d\u0304Q, is the\nenergy that goes from the bath to the system [10, 11, 14,\n15].\nThermodynamics imposes a general relation between\nthe heat received by the circuit and the change of its\nphase-space volume d\u03a3. This statement was proposed\nby Clausius in the last part of the nineteenth century,\nand became established as one of the formulations of the\nsecond law [10, 15]. There are several levels of mathematical rigor by which the Clausius formulation can be\npresented [10, 11, 14, 15]. For our present purposes it\nwill be enough to use the simplest version [11, 12]: If the\nthe circuit receives from the bath a positive amount of\nheat d\u0304Q > 0, then its phase-space volume is increased:\nd\u0304\u03a3 > 0. On the other hand, if the circuit is subjected to\nthe squeezing of its phase-space volume: d\u03a3 < 0, then it\nhas to release heat to the bath: d\u0304Q < 0. In formulas it\nreads:\nd\u0304Q > 0\nd\u03a3 < 0\n\n\u21d2\n\u21d2\n\nd\u03a3 > 0;\nd\u0304Q < 0.\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn the classical domain everybody had a chance to observe the validity of the Clausius formulation when looking at a squeezed substance which heats its environment\n(e.g. a working pomp), or at a heated substance which\ntends to increase its volume (e.g. boiling water). For the\nreader who is familiar with the formal structure of thermodynamics we mention that the Clausius formulation\ncan be presented as the Clausius inequality d\u0304Q \u2264 T dS,\nwhere S is the entropy of the system For our circuit the\nso-called von Neumann entropy reads [11]\n1\n1\n1\n1\nS = (\u03a3 + ) ln(\u03a3 + ) \u2212 (\u03a3 \u2212 ) ln(\u03a3 \u2212 ),\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhich is well a behaved function, since, as we discussed,\nthe variable \u03a3 is larger than or equal to 12 . It starts at\nS( 21 ) = 0, increases monotonically, and behaves for large\n\u03a3 as S = ln \u03a3 + 1 + O(1/\u03a3).\nEqs. (3.2) follow from assuming d\u0304Q \u2264 T dS upon noticing dS \u221d + d\u03a3 [11, 12]. In particular, for T = 0 this inequality produces another version of the Clausius formulation: No heat can be extracted from a zero temperature\nthermal bath. The remaining inequality Q(T = 0) \u2264 0\nsays that heat can only be dumped into the bath.\nAs can be checked directly, if the dispersions of the flux\nand charge have their Gibbsian values (2.11), the Clausius statement is valid. This fact has received a special\nattention in the context of electrical circuits [3, 5]. More\ngenerally, any statistical system which in its stationary\nstate is described by Gibbs distribution has to satisfy the\nClausius formulation [10, 11, 14, 15]. So it is interesting\nto ask what will happen with the Clausius formulation if\nthe temperature of the bath will be low enough, i.e. in the\nquantum situation. Notice that the physical relevance of\nthis question is exactly the same as in the classical situation, since it is expected that thermodynamical relations\nshould not change upon lowering the temperature. As\n\n\f4\nwe argued above, the dispersions h\u03a62 i, hQ2 i are in general not Gibbsian, and the Clausius inequality need not\nbe satisfied. Moreover, as was shown in [11, 12] it can\nbe violated in the quantum regime. Here we will present\nthese results in the context of RLC circuits.\nFirst of all, we notice that there is a general result\nd\u0304Q/dL \u2265 0 valid in all ranges of the parameters [12].\nTo see the violation of the Clausius formulation we show\nthat one can have d\u03a3/dL \u2264 0. We consider low temperatures, i.e. the quantum frequency T /~ is comparable\nwith at least one of other frequencies \u03c90 , 1/(CR) and\nR/L involved in the problem. Depending on the value of\nthe quality factor \u03c90 L/R one can obtain from (2.9) two\nextreme cases [12]:\n\u0012 \u0013\nd\u03a32\nR\n\u0393\n,\n= \u2212 2 ln\ndL\n4L \u03c90\n\u03c90\n\u0013\n\u0012\nd\u03a32\n1\n\u0393L2\n,\n= \u2212 2 ln\ndL\n\u03c0 L\nCR3\n\nfor\nfor\n\n\u03c90 L\n\u226b 1; (3.4)\nR\n\u03c90 L\n\u226a 1. (3.5)\nR\n\nRecall that \u0393 is assumed to be much larger than any other\nfrequency, so that both logarithms are positive, implying\nthat in both cases d\u03a3/dL is negative. The first case\nis realized in case of high quality (weak damping); it is\nthen natural that d\u03a3 is proportional to the small inverse\nquality, since for R = 0, \u03a3 is just equal to 21 (recall that\nthe temperature is low) and, thus, does not vary with\nL. It is seen also that, apart from a small prefactor, d\u03a3\nis multiplied by the logarithm of a large number. The\nsecond equation describes the low quality situation, and\nhere d\u03a3 is just proportional to the logarithm of a large\nnumber. This makes the situation especially interesting,\nsince L d\u03a32 /dL is at least of order unity. For both above\ncases the change of heat is given by [12]:\n~R\nd\u0304Q\n> 0.\n=\ndL\n2\u03c0L2\n\n(3.6)\n\nTwo things have to be noted with this formula: it does\nnot depend on \u0393, not even through a logarithm, and its\nratio to the ground-state energy \u223c ~\u03c90 of the circuit just\nproduces the quality factor: ~\u03c90 /\u2206Q \u223c L\u03c90 /R, where\n\u2206Q \u223c Ld\u0304Q/dL. So this zero-temperature heat is potentially observable for low quality circuits. Notice that\nthe very existence of the positive zero-temperature heat\ncontradicts the Clausius inequality.\nIt should be mentioned that there is a widespread argument against a positive zero-temperature heat, stating:\nSince at T = 0 the bath is in its ground state, it cannot\nprovide energy to the circuit. This is clearly incorrect,\nbecause if the circuit and the bath do interact, the bath\nby itself cannot be in its ground state. It is always in a\nmixed state, and this is the property of quantum entanglement. Changing a parameter of the junction can lead\nto a transfer of zero-point energy from the bath to the\njunction, and this should be identified with heat, since it\nis arising from the unobservable bath modes.\n\n4.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nIn the present section we will briefly discuss the possibilities of experimental detection of the violation of the\nClausius formulation. In general, one needs to observe\nh\u03a62 i and hQ2 i for several different values of the inductivity L. These are sufficient to recover the corresponding\nchanges of the energy, the phase-space volume and the\nwork according to formulas (2.12, 2.10, 3.1) respectively.\nIn the second step one can check the consistency of the\nresults by observing directly the work done by the external source, as can be done using an additional control circuit [18]. The observed work is then subtracted\nfrom the total energy to get the heat and to confirm\nd\u0304Q(T \u2192 0) 6= 0 and d\u0304Q/dL > 0. Altogether, the main\nchallenge of the experimental observation is in observation of the variances.\nWe are not aware of experiments which measure both\nh\u03a62 i and hQ2 i directly. However, there are several experiments which report indirect observations of the variances\nin different regimes. In [16] the authors considered mesoscopic electrical circuits in the context of single charge\ntunneling. The used circuits had thickness of the order\n10 nm and wideness of the order 1 \u03bcm. The observations\nallowed indirect determination of hQ2 i. With the subsequent improving made in [17], the correspondence with\nthe theoretical expression (2.9) is perfect. The observations were done with C =4.5 fF, L =4.5 nH and for R\nin the range 101 \u2212 103 k\u03a9, which corresponds with the\nquality factor varying from 10\u22121 to 10\u22123 . To avoid thermal noises, the circuits were cooled down to 20 mK. At\nsuch a low temperature quantum effects are really dominating, since the quantum frequency T /~ \u223c 108 s\u22121 is\ncomparable with the system's characteristic frequencies\n\u03c90 \u223c 109 \u2212 1010 s\u22121 , R/L \u223c 108 s\u22121 and 1/(RC) \u223c 109\ns\u22121 .\nLet us now estimate the outcome of our effect with the\nabove parameters. Taking R = 103 k\u03a9 one gets from\n(3.6) \u2206Q \u223c L d\u0304Q/dL \u223c 10\u221219 J \u223c 1 eV, an observable effect. On the other hand, restoring Boltzmann's\nconstant, the right hand side of the Clausius inequality\nkB T \u2206S \u223c kB T takes a much smaller value, since for\nT = 20 mK one has kB T \u223c 10\u221225 J \u223c 10\u22126 eV. Thus to\nverify the violation of the Clausius inequality it suffices\nto take the sign of \u2206L positive, which brings a positive\n\u2206Q.\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\nThe present paper discusses the Clausius inequality,\none of the formulations of the second law, in the context\nof equilibrium RLC circuits. Following references [11, 12]\nit is confirmed that this inequality is broken if the bath\ntemperature is low enough, namely, if the characteristic quantum time-scale ~/T is comparable with other\nrelevant times of the circuit. The result can be briefly\nsummarized as follows: localization of the system, i.e.\n\n\f5\ndecrease of its entropy or phase-space volume, can be\nconnected with absorption of heat from the bath. This is\nin a sharp contrast with the classical experience, where\nlocalization occurs with emission of heat. We provide a\nsimple and sufficiently general formula (3.6), which describes the effect at low temperatures.\nOne of our main purposes was to compare our result with recent experiments done on nanoscale lowtemperature circuits [16, 17]. This comparison led us to\nconclude that an experimental verification of the Clausius inequality breaking is fully within the reach of modern experiments. It is, therefore, hoped that the present\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n\nH. Nyquist, Phys. Rev. 32, 110, (1928).\nL. Brillouin, Phys. Rev. 78, 627, (1950).\nR.
