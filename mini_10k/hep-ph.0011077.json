Strongly interacting exotics, such as heavy quarks, can be produced in abundance at the Tevatron or\nthe LHC. However, particles which are not strongly interacting, such as heavy charged\nleptons, can best be produced at an electron-positron collider. In general, studies of\nheavy charged leptons at such colliders focus on s-channel production, through a \u03b3, Z,\nZ \u2032 , etc. The phenomenology of exotic particles has been considered widely [1-8]. A good\nreport can be found in Ref. [9].\nIn this paper, we note that a model which arises from superstring-inspired E6 grand\nunification models will allow pair production of heavy charged leptons in the t-channel.\nWe discuss this model, and study the forward-backward and left-right asymmetries at\nlinear colliders. For simplicity, we neglect mixing between extra particles (bosons or\nfermions) and the normal particles of the SM, since such mixing angles are generally\nsmall.\n\n2\n\nThe model\n\nThere are many phenomenologically acceptable low energy models which arise from E6 .\n(a)E6 \u2212\u2192 SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)Y \u2032\n(b)E6 \u2212\u2192 SO(10) \u00d7 U(1)\u03c8 \u2212\u2192 SU(5) \u00d7 U(1)\u03c7 \u00d7 U(1)\u03c8\n(c)E6 \u2212\u2192 SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)L \u00d7 U(1)R\n(c\u2032 )E6 \u2212\u2192 SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)I \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)Y \u2032\nwhere U(1)\u03c8 and U(1)\u03c7 can be combined into U(1)\u03b8 in model (b), reducing it to the\neffective rank-5 model SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)\u03b8 , which is most often considered\nin the literature. Models (c) and (c\u2032 ) come from the subgroup SU(3)C \u00d7SU(3)L \u00d7SU(3)R .\n2\n\n\fThe 27-dimensional fundamental representation has the branching rule\nc\n\n27 = (3c , 3, 1) + (3 , 1, 3) + (1c , 3, 3)\n|\n\n{z\nq\n\n}\n\n|\n\n{z\n\n}\n\nq\n\nand the particles of the first family are assigned as\n\uf8eb\n\n{z\n\n|\n\nl\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(1)\n\n}\n\nEc \u03bd N\nu\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed d \uf8f8 + uc dc hc + \uf8ed N c e E \uf8f8\nec \u03bd c S c\nh\nwhere SU(3)L operates vertically and SU(3)R operates horizontally. (Different symbols\nfor these particles may be used in the literature.)\nThe most common method of breaking the SU(3)R factor is to break the 3 of SU(3)R\ninto 2+1, so that (uc , dc ) forms an SU(2)R doublet with hc as a SU(2)R singlet. This gives\nModel (c), the familiar left-right symmetric model [10]. Model (c) can be reduced further\nto an effective rank-5 model with U(1)V =L+R . Another possibility, resulting in Model (c\u2032 ),\nis to break the 3 of the SU(3)R into 1 + 2 so that (dc , hc ) forms an SU(2) doublet with uc\nas a singlet. In this option, the SU(2) doesn't contribute to the electromagnetic charge\noperator and it is called SU(2)I (I stands for Inert). Then the vector gauge bosons\ncorresponding to SU(2)I are neutral. Model (c\u2032 ) can be reduced to an effective rank-5\nmodel SU(3)C \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 SU(2)I . Both of them will be considered in this\npaper.\nAt the SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)I \u00d7 U(1)Y \u00d7 U(1)Y \u2032 level, a single generation of fermions can\nbe represented as\n\u03bd N\ne\u2212 E \u2212\n\n!\n\nu\nd\n\n,\n\nL\n\n!\n\n,\nL\n\n\u0010\n\ndc hc\n\n\u0011\n\nL\n\n,\n\nEc\nNc\n\n!\n\n,\nL\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bdc Sc\n\n\u0011\n\nL\n\n, hL , ecL , ucL\n\nwhere SU(2)L(I) acts vertically (horizontally). Note that additional heavy leptons\nand its conjugate\n\n\u0010\n\nEc\nNc\n\n\u0011\n\nform two new isodoublets under SU(2)L .\n\n3\n\n\u0010 \u0011\nN\nE\n\n\f3\n\nCross Section Production and Asymmetries\n\nThe relevant interactions for the process e+ e\u2212 \u2212\u2192 E + E \u2212 are\nL =\n\nX\n\nQf f \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bc f\u03b1 A\u03bc +\n\nf =e,E\n\ng\ne\u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bc (Te3\u03b1 \u2212 Qe sin2 \u03b8W )e\u03b1 Z\u03bc\ncos \u03b8W\n\ng\nE \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 2 sin2 \u03b8W )E\u03b1 Z\u03bc\n2 cos \u03b8W\ngI\n+ \u221a e\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )EWI\u03bc + H.c.\n2 2\ngI\n+ (E\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )E \u2212 e\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )e)ZI\u03bc\n4\nX\nYf\u2032\n+\ngY \u2032 \u03b1 f \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bc f\u03b1 Z\u03bc\u2032\n2\nf =e,E\n+\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = L or R. g, gI and gY \u2032 are coupling constants and \u03b8W is the electroweak mixing\nangle. For simplicity, we will assume that gI = g and gY \u2032 = gY in our numerical results,\nit is straightforward to relax this assumption. The first two lines are couplings between\nfermions and standard \u03b3 and Z. The rest are couplings with extra neutral gauge bosons.\nThe e+ e\u2212 \u2192 E + E \u2212 process can proceed via s-channel exchange of a \u03b3, Z, Z \u2032 or ZI , and\ncan also proceed via t-channel exchange of a WI . Each amplitude can be written as the\nform of\nCi ve \u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 ai \u03b35 )ue uE \u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 bi \u03b35 )vE .\n\n(3)\n\nNote that the WI leads to a t-channel process unsuppressed by small mixing angles.\nThis is unique to this model. Note that if one considered production of the heavy charged\nleptons which form an SU(2)I doublet with the muon or the tau, then the processes would\nbe identical except that the t-channel process would be absent.\nThe differential cross section for this process is given by\n1\nd\u03c3\n=\nd cos \u03b8\n8\u03c0s\n\ns\n\n1 m2E\n\u2212\n{D1 (m2E \u2212 u)2 + D2 (m2E \u2212 t)2 + 2D3 m2E s}\n4\ns\n\ns, t and u are the Mandelstam variables, and with\nD1 =\n\n5\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\nCi Cj {(1 + ai aj )(1 + bi bj ) + (ai + aj )(bi + bj )}\n4\n\n(4)\n\n\f5\nX\n\nD2 =\n\ni,j=1\n5\nX\n\nD3 =\n\ni,j=1\n\nCi Cj {(1 + ai aj )(1 + bi bj ) \u2212 (ai + aj )(bi + bj )}\nCi Cj {(1 + ai aj )(1 \u2212 bi bj )}\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the Ci , ai and bi are given in Table 1.\nTable 1\ni\n1\n2\n3\n\nCoefficients appearing in Eq.

[11, 12], but only s-channel contributions were considered.\n\n4\n\nResults\n\nThe electroweak part SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y has been measured precisely. Let us first consider\nthe rank 5 case. Setting gY \u2032 = 0, we have two gauge boson mass parameters mWI\nand mZI . We will assume that these masses are equal and thus there is only one mass\nparameter remaining, which we choose to be near the experimental lower bound for direct\n5\n\n\fproduction[13], mZI = 650 GeV. This is basically the same as assuming that the gauge\nbosons do not substantially mix with each other. The numerical results for cross section,\nforward-backward and left-right asymmetries are shown in Figs. 1-3. We have plotted\nthe results for E + E \u2212 and M + M \u2212 production, where M is the SU(2)I partner of the\nmuon or tau (the only difference will be due to the t-channel process). For comparison,\nwe also include the standard model results for both a vectorlike heavy lepton and a chiral\nheavy lepton. Although we have assumed that the ZI mass (E, M mass) is 650 GeV (200\nGeV), it is easy to see how the figures will be qualitatively modified if these assumptions\nare relaxed.\nIn the rank 6 model, one has an additional mass scale and additional coupling. If we\nassume that the gY \u2032 coupling is the same as gY , and that the mass of the Z \u2032 is\n\n5gY\n3gI\n\nMZI ,\n\nthen one can recalculate the cross section, forward-backward and left-right asymmetries.\nWe find that there is not a substantial difference from the rank 5 case, except in the\nimmediate vicinity of the Z \u2032 mass.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nHow does one detect these leptons? The main decay modes depend sensitively on the\nmasses and mixing angles. Since the E and its isodoublet partner N are degenerate in\nthe limit of no mixing, one expects the E \u2192 NW \u2217 to be into a virtual W , leading to\na three-body decay. Since the allowed three-body phase space is very small, this decay\nwill be negligible unless the mixing with the lighter generations is extremely small. In\nthe more natural case, in which such mixing is not very small, the two-body decays\nE \u2192 \u03bde W and E \u2192 eZ would dominate. A detailed analysis of the lifetimes and the\ndecay modes can be found in Ref. [14]. There, it was shown that the ratio of \u0393(E \u2192 eZ)\nto \u0393(E \u2192 \u03bde W ) is given by the ratio of |UEe |2 to |UE\u03bde |2 . This is very model-dependent.\n\n6\n\n\fCertainly, the signature for E \u2192 eZ would be quite dramatic. Even if the Z decays\nhadronically or invisibly, the monochromatic electron, plus the invariant mass of the Z\ndecay products, would allow for virtually background-free detection. The signature for\nE \u2192 \u03bde W is less dramatic, but would lead to W + W \u2212 plus missing transverse momentum.\nAs discussed in Ref. [8], requiring that the W 's decay leptonically gives a signal of l+ l\u2212 ,\nwhere l = (e, \u03bc). The backgrounds, due to e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , W + W \u2212 and ZZ, can be\neliminated by calculating the invariant mass of the charged fermion pair. The signal\nwould be striking since it would consists of a pair of l+ l\u2212 with approximately the same\ninvariant mass.\nSuppose these leptons are found. One would first learn the cross section. Unless\none is in the vicinity of the ZI resonance, the cross section in this model would be\n\u221a\nsomewhat higher than the standard model. For example, at an NLC of s = 500 GeV\nand luminosity of 6 \u00d7 104 pb\u22121 /yr and for a heavy lepton of 200 GeV, one expects\napproximately 2 \u00d7 104 SM vectorlike fermion pairs produced per year, whereas one has\n3\u00d7104 E + E \u2212 pairs and 5\u00d7104 M + M \u2212 pairs (note that the t-channel process destructively\ninterferes). In the vicinity of the resonance, of course, the cross section can be much\nlarger. As discussed in the previous paragraph, if the main decay is into \u03bdW , then a very\nclear signature arises if both W 's decay into e\u03bde or \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc . This will occur approximately 5%\nof the time, giving a few thousand such events per year. Necessary cuts on the transverse\nmissing energy will reduce the number of usable events, but it should still be several\nhundred per year, with very low background. If the main decay is into eZ or \u03bcZ, then\nthe signature is even more dramatic.\nThere is no forward-backward asymmetry for the pair production of SM vectorlike\nfermions, while the polarization asymmetry for heavy SM chiral fermions is very small.\nTherefore, combining AF B with ALR would make it very straightforward to distinguish\nE + E \u2212 and M + M \u2212 pairs from SM fermions. The behavior of the asymmetries for each\n7\n\n\fof these is very different at high\n\n\u221a\n\ns.\n\nAn important point is to note that the statistical uncertainty,\n\n\u0010\n\n1\u2212A2\nN\n\n\u00111/2\n\n, is very small\n\nfor this model. With the approximate number of reconstructed events being between\nseveral hundred and several thousand, this gives a statistical uncertainty of between 1\nand 10 percent. This will be even smaller in the vicinity of the resonance. From the\nfigures, it is clear that this uncertainty is small enough that the various models can be\ndistinguished, even off-resonance.\nWe thank JoAnne Hewett for a useful conversation.
