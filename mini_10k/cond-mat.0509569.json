By\nstudying the interaction of electrons with impurities\nas well as interaction between electrons Lebed and\nBak[2] have predicted that the resistance, Rxx , has\npeaks at the magic angles \u03b8 = tan\u22121 ( bc pq ), where p\nand q are mutually prime integers and b and c are\nlattice constants, when the magnetic field is rotated\nin the plane perpendicular to the most conducting a\naxis. Experimentally, dips, instead of peaks, of the\nresistance at the magic angles are observed in both\nRxx and Rzz in various quasi-one-dimensional organic\nconductors, (TMTSF)2 ClO4 [3, 4], (TMTSF)2 PF6 [5, 6],\n(TMTSF)2 ReO4 [7], (DMET)2 I3 [8], (DMET)2 CuCl2 [9],\n(DMET-TSeF)2 AuCl2 [10] and (DMET-TSeF)2 AuI2 [10,\n11]. It is called as the magic angle effect(MAE).\nOther angle dependences of the magnoresistance\nhave also been observed in quasi-two-dimensional\nconductors[12, 13, 14], and in quasi-one-dimensional conductors with rotating magnetic field in the a-c plane[15]\nand in the a-b plane[16]. These angle dependences are\nexplained in the semiclassical theory[15, 16, 17, 18] and\nthey are used as powerful tools to observe the shape of\nthe Fermi surface in low-dimensional systems.\nFor MAE, however, no complete explanation has been\ngiven yet, although there exit several theories[19, 20,\n21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Interesting idea of\nthe magnetic-field-induced confinement[22] has been proposed to explain MAE. Difference between the ground\nstates at the magic angles and at other directions of\nthe magnetic field is observed by the metallic and nonmetallic temperature dependence of the resistance[6]. In\n\nrecent NMR experiment[29], however, no evidence for\nthe change of the excitation spectrum at the magic angles has been obtained. This fact suggests that semiclassical approach, or equivalently Green function approach using the linearized kx dispersion, can be applied in these systems. Indeed, MAE can be explained\nqualitatively in the semiclassical theory. By using the\nsemiclassical equations of motion for the noninteracting\nelectrons in the tilted magnetic field, Osada et al.[19]\nhave shown that the conductivity in the z axis \u03c3zz shows\npeaks at the magic angles. In quasi-one-dimensional\nconductors the energy dispersion is described as \u01ebk =\n\u22122ta cos akx \u2212 2tb cos bky \u2212 2tc cos ckz \u2212 \u03bc. Here we take\nthe simple cubic lattice with lattice constant a, b, and\nc for simplicity. Since ta \u226b tb > tc , the Fermi surface\n\u03c0\nis two nearly parallel sheets at kx \u2248 \u00b1kF and kF = 4a\nfor the quarter-filled band. Osada et al[19] used the linearized dispersion in the kx direction as\nX\n\u01ebL (k) = \u00b1~vF (|kx |\u2212kF )\u2212\ntmn cos(mbky +nckz ), (1)\nm,n\n\nand constant relaxation time \u03c4 . They have shown that\npeaks appear in \u03c3yy and \u03c3zz at the magic angles and\nthe heights of peaks are proportional to t2pq . In order\nto explain the experimental results of the perpendicular\nmagnetoresistance, unphysically large values of tpq are\nrequired. This model also fails to explain the magnitude\nof the recently observed giant Nernst effect[30] at the\nmagic angles. Maki[21] has used the similar approximation of the linearized dispersion and constant \u03c4 , but took\naccount of the ky dependence of vx in perturbation in ttab .\nRecently, Lebed et al.[26, 27] have emphasized the importance of the ky dependence of vx , or the density of states\non the Fermi surface. They show that there occurs the\n\n\f2\n1D to 2D dimensional crossover when the magnetic field\nis at magic angles. In these approximation resonance-like\npeaks in \u03c3zz at the magic angle with q = 1 is obtained,\nbut its height is proportional to ( ttab )2p and very small in\nthe case of tb \u226a ta [21].\nThe more serious discrepancy between the semiclassical theories of MAE and experiments is encountered in\nthe one-dimensional conductivity \u03c3xx . In the model of\nOsada et al.[19], \u03c3xx does not depend on the direction\nof the magnetic field. Maki[21] has pointed out that \u03c3xx\nshows peaks at magic angles, if the ky and kz dependence\nof vx is taken into account. It is, however, very weak,\ni.e., it is of the order of ( ttac )2 . Meanwhile, Chaikin[20]\nhas shown that the angular-dependence of \u03c3xx can be explained, if there are hot spots on the Fermi surface, where\n\u03c4 is small.\nIn this letter we show that the peaks in onedimensional conductivity \u03c3xx at the magic angles are dramatically enhanced, when vx depends strongly on ky and\nkz on the Fermi surface, even when long-range hopping\nterms and hot spots are absent. In quasi-one dimensional\norganic conductors, electrons correlate strongly and the\nsystem is close to the insulating state of SDW or fieldinduced SDW due to the nearly perfect nested Fermi surface. Then vx on the Fermi surface depends on ky and\nkz much stronger than in perturbation in ttab and ttac studied by Maki[21] and Lebed et al.[25, 26]. The effect of\nelectron correlation on vx and \u03c4 can be calculated by using the random phase approximation for the quasi-one\ndimensional Hubbard model, which we will show in another publication[31]. In order to show MAE due to the\nky and kz dependence of vx , we calculate \u03c3xx in the model\nthat the velocity vx in some region on the Fermi surface\ndiffers sufficiently from that in the other region.\nWe assume the constant \u03c4 . Then the conductivity is\ncalculated as[16, 19, 23, 24]\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ 0\nt\ndf\n2e2 X\nvi (k(0))\nvj (k(t))e \u03c4 dt (2)\n\u2212\n\u03c3ij =\nV\nd\u01ebk\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(a)\n\n2\u03c0\n\nv0\n2\u03c0\u03b4\n\nkz\n\n2\u03c0\u03b4w\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03b1 v0\nky\n(b)\n\nS0\n\n1 \u2202E(k)\nv(k(t)) =\n.\n~ \u2202k(t)\n\n(3)\n\nkz\n\nS1\n\nq 2\u03c0\n\nky\nFIG. 1: (a) Simple model that vx is \u03b1v0 in the small rectangular region and v0 in the other region in the Brillouin zone.\n(b) Extended Brillouin zone for tan \u03b8 = pq = 23 .

This is the\nmain idea of the Chaikin's hot spots and other semiclassical theories of MAE. In order to simplify the calculation,\nwe assume vx = v0 except for in the rectangular region\nof 2\u03c0\u03b4 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u03b4w, where vx = \u03b1v0 (\u03b1 6= 1), as shown in\nFig. 1(a) and a = b = c = 1. In the quasi-one dimensional system the density of states on the Fermi surface\ncan be expressed as a function of energy \u01eb, ky and kz as\nN (\u01eb, ky , kz ) =\n\ndk(t)\n= \u2212ev(k(t)) \u00d7 B\ndt\n\n1\n|~vx (\u01eb, ky , kz )|\n\n(5)\n\n\u2202f\nby \u03b4(\u01eb \u2212\nAt low temperature we can replace \u2212 \u2202\u01eb\nk\n\u01ebF (ky , kz )) in Eq.(2) and we obtain\n\n\u03c3xx\n\nZ\nt\n2e2 X 0\n=2\nvx (k(t))e \u03c4 dt,\n~V\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(6)\n\nky ,kz\n\nThe velocity v(k(t)) depends on time via the time dependence of the wave vector k(t) as\n~\n\nB\np2\u03c0\n\nk\n\nwhere i and j are x, y or z, and vi (k(t)) is the velocity\non the Fermi surface in the semiclassical picture\n\n,S1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we take the magnetic field B in the y \u2212 z plane,\nBx = 0, By = B sin \u03b8, and Bz = B cos \u03b8.\nWhen \u03b8 = tan\u22121 ( cb pq ), k started from some point k(0)\nmoves in the commensurate trail on the Fermi surface\nbefore coming back to k(0), while it travels all the Fermi\n\nwhere summation on ky and kz should be done on the\nright sheet of the Fermi surface (vx (k(t))) > 0). A factor of 2 comes from the contribution of the left sheet of\nthe Fermi surface. Although \u03c3zz is given by the correlation of vz (k(0)) and vz (kz (t)) in Eq.(2), \u03c3xx in quasi-one\ndimensional system is simply given by the momentumspace average of the time average (weighted by exp( \u03c4t ))\nof vx (k(t)). We consider the case of eB\u03c4 \u226b 1. Then integration over t can be approximated by \u03c4 times the time\naverage of vx (k(t)) over the trajectory of k(t). It might\n\n\f3\nbe thought that \u03c3xx does not depend on the direction\nof the magnetic field, but it does, since the time-average\nis performed on the trajectory, which depends on the\nangle of the magnetic field. Since the speed of k(t) in\nthe momentum space is proportional to vx (k(t)) when\n|vx | \u226b |vy |, |vz |, as seen from Eq. (4), time average of\nvx (k(t)) can be calculated as follows.\nFirst, we consider the commensurate case, tan \u03b8 = pq ,\nwhere p and q are mutually prime integers. Brillouin\nzone is extended q times p as shown in Fig. 1(b). In the\nblack region (area S1 = (2\u03c0)2 w\u03b4 2 ), vx = \u03b1v0 . The gray\nand black regions in Fig. 1(b) is defined as the set of k(0)\nthat goes into the black region at some t. The area of\nthe gray region is\nw\n)\u03b4 \u2212 S1\ntan \u03b8\n= (2\u03c0)2 (p + qw \u2212 \u03b4w)\u03b4.\n\nS0 = (2\u03c0)2 p(1 +\n\nFIG. 2: Angular dependence of \u03c3xx for the model of ky and\nkz dependent vx .\n\n(7)\n\nS1\nS0\nWe define s0 \u2261 (2\u03c0)\n2 = (p + qw \u2212 \u03b4w)\u03b4 and s1 \u2261 (2\u03c0)2 =\nw\u03b4 2 . The gray region in Fig. 1(b) should be translated\nin the first Brillouin zone. Therefore, if (p + qw)\u03b4 > 1, all\nthe first Brillouin zone becomes black or gray region, i.e.,\nevery k(0) goes into S1 . If (p+qw)\u03b4 < 1, however, we can\ndivide the first Brillouin zone into two regions, the first\nregion (S1 + S0 ), and the second region (2\u03c0)2 \u2212 (S1 + S1 ).\nIf k(0) is in the first region, vx (k(t)) changes the value as\nk(t) travels on the commensurate trajectory on the Fermi\nsurface, while vx (k(t)) is time-independent constant v0\nfor the k(0) in the second region. Now, we calculate the\nmomentum-space average and time average of vx , when\nthe magnetic field is at the magic angle \u03b8 = tan\u22121 pq and\n(p + qw)\u03b4 < 1. If k(0) is in S1 or S0 , the duration when\nk(t) is in the region S1 is approximately proportional to\ns1\n\u03b1v0 , while that in S0 is approximately proportional to\ns0\nv0 . Thus the time average of vx (k(t)) when k(0) is in\nS1 + S0 is given by\n\nhvx i(S1 +S0 ) \u2248 \u03b1v0\n\ns1\n\u03b1v0\ns1\n\u03b1v0\n\n+\ns1 + s0\n= v0 s1\n\u03b1 + s0\n\ns0\nv0\n\n+ v0\n\ns0\nv0\ns1\n\u03b1v0\n\n+\n\nFIG. 3: Angular dependence of \u03c3xx for another choice of \u03b1,\n\u03b4 and w.

In this case, k(t) goes into the region S1 at\nsome t regardless of the initial point k(0), i.e. the trajectory is incommensurate.

The peak\n\n\f4\nheights becomes large (\u221d \u03b11 ) as \u03b1 approaches to 0. In\nIC\nIC\nFigs. 2 and 3, we plot (\u03c3xx \u2212 \u03c3xx\n)/\u03c3xx\nfor several parameters of \u03b1, \u03b4 and w. If s1 is small, there are a lot of\npeaks at magic angles, tan\u22121 1 = 45\u25e6 , tan\u22121 2 \u2248 63.4\u25e6,\ntan\u22121 21 \u2248 26.6\u25e6 , tan\u22121 13 \u2248 18.4\u25e6 , etc. as seen in Fig. 2,\nbut the heights of peaks are small. On the other hand,\nthe number of peaks is small but their heights are large\nfor larger s1 (Fig. 3).\nIn conclusion we show that peaks in \u03c3xx at magic angles are large, when vx depends on ky and kz on the Fermi\nsurface of the quasi-one dimensional conductors. In the\nsimple model that vx = v0 is constant except for in the\nrectangular region on the Fermi surface, where vx is another constant value vx = \u03b1v0 , we get the approximate\nform of \u03c3xx by using the simple calculation of taking the\nmomentum-space average on the Fermi surface and the\ntime average on the trajectory of k(t). MAE is the consequence of the fact that k(t) stays shorter time in the\nregion where |vx (ky , kz )| is large, and in the region of\nsmall |vx (ky , kz )|, k(t) stays longer time. In this Letter,\nonly \u03c3xx as a function of the tilting angle of the magnetic\nfield is studied. The similar mechanism works also for \u03c3zz\nand the peak heights of \u03c3zz at the magic angles will be\nmuch more enhanced by considering the strong ky and kz\ndependence of vx as done in this paper than that studied\nby Maki[21] and Lebed et al.[26, 27] in the perturbation theory in ttab . If we take account of the momentumdependent relaxation time and more realistic momentum\ndependence of the velocity vx (ky , kz ), experimentally observed peaks of \u03c3xx and \u03c3zz at magic angles will be explained better. Although MAE of \u03c3xx can be explained\nwithin the semiclassical theory, the strong momentumdependence of the Fermi velocity, which may be caused\nby interactions between electrons, plays a crucial role to\nunderstand the magnitudes of the peak heights. This\nfeature is in contrast to the other angle dependence of\nthe conductivity in quasi-one and quasi-two dimensional\nconductors[15, 16, 17, 18] and usual quantum oscillations\nsuch as Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, where the shape\nof the Fermi surface is important.\nThis work is partly supported by a Grant-in-Aid for\nthe Promotion of Science and Scientific Research on Priority Areas (Grant No. 16038223) from the Ministry of\nEducation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.\n\n[1] T.
