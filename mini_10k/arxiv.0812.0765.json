INTRODUCTION\nThe core of digital chaos-based cryptography is the selection of a good chaotic map for a given encryption scheme.\nActually, the presence of chaos does not guarantee the\nsecurity of an encryption algorithm (Kocarev, 2001). A\ngood digital cryptosystem based on chaos should not be\njust the concomitance of a chaotic map and an encryption\narchitecture, but the result of their synergical association.\nIndeed, the quality of a chaotic map for cryptography must\nbe evaluated not just with considerations on its dynamic\nproperties, but also with considerations on the needs of\nthe sustaining encryption architecture. In other words,\nfrom a general point of view it is not possible to design\nchaotic cryptosystems satisfying the chaotic-system-free\nproperty (Li, 2003, p. 30) and, as a result, the selection\nof a certain encryption scheme demands the selection of a\ngroup of chaotic maps satisfying a certain set of dynamical\nproperties. Finally, digital chaos-based cryptography is\nimplemented on computers and thus the problem derived\nfrom finite-precision computation must be evaluated and\nconveniently handled during the design stage. This work\nillustrates the problems with three elements involved in\nthe design of digital chaos-based cryptosystems, i.e., the\nselection of a chaotic map (Sec. 2), the selection of an\nencryption architecture (Sec. 3) and the implementation\nof the encryption system (Sec. 4).\n\u22c6 The work described in this paper was supported by Ministerio\nde Educaci\u00f3n y Ciencia of Spain, research grant SEG2004-02418,\nCDTI, Ministerio de Industria, Turismo y Comercio of Spain in\ncollaboration with Telef\u00f3nica I+D, Project SEGUR@ with reference CENIT-2007 2004, CDTI, Ministerio de Industria, Turismo\ny Comercio of Spain in collaboration with SAP, project HESPERIA\n(CENIT 2006-2009), and Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n of\nSpain in collaboration, project CUCO (MTM2008-02194).

Definition of the key leading to nonchaotic behavior. In some chaos-based cryptosystems\nthe control parameters of the underlying chaotic systems\nare determined by the secret key. If the link between the\nsecret key and the control parameters is not established\ncarefully, then it is possible that the underlying chaotic\nsystem evolves in an non-chaotic way, which further erodes\nthe confusion and diffusion properties required by the\nresulting cryptosystem.\nThe chaotic systems used as base of cryptosystems are\ndefined in a parametric way such that their dynamics\ndepends on one or several control parameters. Moreover,\nthose chaotic systems are dynamical systems which show\na chaotic behavior for certain values of the associated control parameter(s). Therefore, the design of a cryptosystem\nbased on any of those dynamical systems must be done by\nguaranteeing the use of the set of values for the control\nparameter(s) leading to chaos. Otherwise, the underlying dynamical system associated to the cryptosystem (or\nencryption system) evolves non-chaotically, which implies\nthe reduction of the level of entropy in the ciphertext (i.e.,\nthe output of the cryptosystem) and of the influence on the\nciphertext of a change in the plaintext (i.e., the input of\nthe cryptosystem). This problem is specially relevant when\nthe design of the cryptosystem is based on a dynamical\nsystem with chaotic behavior only for a set of disjoint\nintervals of values of the control parameter(s). This is the\ncase of the logistic map and the H\u00e9non map, which have\nbeen used in (Pareek et al., 2003) and in (Chee and Xu,\n2006) respectively without a thoroughly analysis of their\ndynamics (Alvarez et al., 2003a; Arroyo et al., 2008b). As a\nconclusion, it is highly advisable to use dynamical systems\nwith chaotic behavior for all the values of the control\n\n\fparameter(s). That is, robust chaotic systems (Banerjee\net al., 1998) should be used instead of nonrobust ones.\nProblem 2. Nonuniform probability distribution function. In some chaos-based encryption architectures the\nconfusion and/or diffusion properties depends on the probability distribution function of the orbits derived from the\nselected chaotic systems. If that distribution is not uniform\nand independent of the value(s) of control parameter(s),\nthen the quality of the diffusion process is reduced.\nThe iteration of a chaotic map can be used to generate\npseudo-random sequences to encrypt the plaintext. The\nencryption procedure could be performed by different\nways, but all of them demand the equiprobability of all the\nstates contained in the pseudo-random sequences. If this\nrequirement is not satisfied, then the conditional entropy\nof the ciphertext with respect to the plaintext may be large\nenough to leak information about relationships between\nthe output and the input of the target cryptosystem (see\nthe entropy attack in (Alvarez et al., 2003c)). This effect is\nspecially significant for image encryption, as pointed out\nrecently by Li et al. (2007) (see Fig. 5 of their paper).\nAs a remedy, chaotic maps with a uniform probability\ndistribution function should be selected as base of this\nkind of cryptosystems, being the family of piecewise linear\nchaotic maps (Li et al., 2005) a good option.\nProblem 3. Return map reconstruction. The ciphertext of some cryptosystems make it possible to reconstruct\na return map of the underlying chaotic system. If such a\nreturn map is meaningful, then an attacker may be able to\ninfer the value(s) of the control parameter(s) that govern\nthe evolution of the chaotic system.\nThe most direct way to estimate the control parameter(s)\nfrom a chaotic orbit is to plot xn+1 versus xn , which is\nactually the chaotic map itself. If this representation shows\na simple function between xn+1 and xn , then it could be\npossible to infer the control parameter. In (Skrobek, 2008)\na chosen-ciphertext attack is used to build a discretized\nversion of the logistic map which further leads to the\nestimation of the control parameter. One solution against\nthis kind of attack is to shuffle/truncate the chaotic orbit\nbefore using it for encryption, which randomizes the plot\nof the the return map.\n3. PROBLEMS WITH THE ENCRYPTION\nARCHITECTURE\nProblem 4. Bad definition of the ciphertexts. A bad\ndefinition of the ciphertext derived from a chaos-based\ncryptosystem could allow the estimation of the initial\ncondition(s) and/or the control parameter(s) of the underlying chaotic system. This problem is present in some\nchaos-based cryptosystems whose ciphertext is given by\nfragments of orbits, sampled versions of the orbits, or\ndiscretized versions of the orbits of the underlying chaotic\nsystems.\nA N -dimensional discrete-time chaotic map is defined by\nthe rule of evolution\nxn+1 = f\u03bb (xn ),\n(1)\nand, as a result, the ciphertext can not be the orbits of\nthe map since it may allow the estimation of \u03bb from N + 1\n\nor a bit more consecutive units of ciphertext (see (Arroyo\net al., 2008c)). If the invariant set of the chaotic map has a\nsize dependent on the control parameter(s), even sampled\nversions of the orbits may allow the estimation of the\ncontrol parameter(s). This is the case of the cryptosystems\nreported in (Garc\u0131\u0301a and Jim\u00e9nez, 2002; Pisarchik et al.,\n2006) and cryptanalyzed in (Alvarez et al., 2003b; Arroyo\net al., 2008d). Finally, the theory of symbolic dynamics\ncan be used when the ciphertext allows to get the symbolic\nsequences of the orbits of a chaotic map (see (Alvarez et al.,\n2003a; Arroyo et al., 2008a)).\nProblem 5. Efficiency of the cryptosystem depending on the value of the key. If the encryption and\ndecryption times depend on the key or a sub-key, then a\ntiming-attack can be performed to estimate the (sub-)key.\nSome encryption architectures perform the transformation\nof the plaintext into the ciphertext through several encryption rounds. Additionally, in each encryption round\na chaotic map is iterated n times. Since the encryption\nand decryption time has to be constant and independent\nof the value of the key, it is not a good practice to select\nthe number of encryption rounds and n as part of the key.\nOtherwise, a timing-attack based on the analysis of the\nencryption and decryption time can be used for the partial\nestimation of the secret key (see (Arroyo et al., 2008d)),\nwhich is a serious security flaw. Instead, the number of\nencryption rounds and the number of iterations of the map\nshould be public parameters of the cryptosystem.\nProblem 6. Faulty derivation of the parameters of\nthe chaotic system from the key. In some chaosbased cryptosystems the key is used to derive the values of\nthe parameters necessary to iterate a chaotic system and\nfinally encrypt the information. If this mapping implies a\nreduction of the key space, i.e., that it is only used a subset\nof the possible values of those parameters, then a bruteforce attack on the values of the parameter could be much\nless demanding than the one on the secret key.\nOne important step in the design of a chaos-based cryptosystem is to decide what the key is. One possibility is to\nuse the control parameter(s) and the initial condition(s)\nof the underlying chaotic system(s) as the secret key or\nas part of the secret key. Another option is to establish\nthe values of the control parameter(s) and the initial\ncondition(s) of the map(s) from the secret key through a\ncertain function. In this sense, it must be assured that the\nimage set of that function is the whole set of possible values\nof the control parameter(s) and the initial condition(s).\nOtherwise, a brute-force attack can be performed on the\nreduced space of control parameter(s) and initial condition\nvalues with a lower computational cost than the one on the\nkey space. A cryptosystem with this problem was introduced in (Pareek et al., 2003) and was later cryptanalyzed\nin (Alvarez et al., 2003a).\nProblem 7. Encryption procedure equivalent to a\nmapping only dependent on the key. If the transformation of the plaintext into the ciphertext is determined\nby a procedure equivalent to a mapping only dependent\non the key, then known/chosen-plaintext attacks may be\nperformed to reconstruct the transformation procedure.\n\n\fIn some encryption schemes the transformation of the\nplaintext into the ciphertext is leading either by a procedure derived using only the key, or by a sampling process\non a sequence of values generated using only the key. In\nthose situations, it could be possible to estimate either\nthe key or to make up some function somehow equivalent\nto the encryption procedure. For example, if the encryption procedure consists of searching plaintexts in pseudorandom sequences generated by iterating a chaotic map,\nsince the pseudo-random sequence remains unchanged unless the key is modified, then it is possible to reconstruct\nthe pseudo-random sequence through a chosen-plaintext\nattack (see (Alvarez et al., 2004a,b)). This problem also\nexists in those schemes where the encryption procedure\nconsists of a permutation-only stage which is fixed unless\nthe control parameter(s) and initial condition(s) change,\ni.e., unless the the secret key is updated (see (Li et al.,\n2008b) for a general qualitative analysis of this attack).\nAs a conclusion, the encryption function that transforms\na unit of plaintext into a unit of ciphertext should depend\non the key and on the whole plaintext.\n\nthe theoretical model). In (Alvarez and Li, 2006) some\nconsequences of the dynamical degradation of a chaotic\nmap are shown in the context of cryptography, whereas in\n(Li et al., 2005) one can find a thorough analysis of the\ndynamical degradation of a specific chaotic map and some\nways to overcome this problem.\nProblem 10. Lack of details in the description. According to Kerckhoffs' principle, the security of a cryptosystem can not be based on the secrecy of its encryption\nand decryption procedures. Furthermore, the key of any\ncryptosystem has to be easy to establish and to exchange,\nand the key space must be defined in an explicit and clear\nway.\n\nThe consecution of security through obscurity is something\nto avoid when designing an encryption scheme. All the operations involved in the encryption/decryption procedures\nmust be verbosely explained, and the secret key must be\nclearly specified along with an exact estimation of the size\nof the key space. The security of the cryptosystem must\nbe only related to the difficulty of guessing the key, and it\ncan not depend on the lack of knowledge about the inner\n4.
