INTRODUCTION\nThe Soft Computing techniques are based on the\ninformation processing in biological systems.\nThe complex biological information processing\nsystem enables the human beings to survive with\naccomplishing tasks like recognition of\nsurrounding, making prediction, planning, and\nacting accordingly.\nFor a computing system to have human like\ninformation processing facility, it should be\nflexible enough to support three features:\nopenness, robustness, and real time processing.\nOpenness of a system is its ability to adapt or\nextend on its own to cope with changes\nencountered in the real world. Robustness of a\nsystem means its stability and tolerability when\nconfronted with distorted, incomplete, or\nimprecise\ninformation.\nThe\nreal\ntime\ncharacteristic implies the ability of the system to\nreact within a reasonable time in response to an\nevent. Information processing systems with all\nthese three characteristics are known as real\nworld computing (RWC) systems [1]. A RWC\nsystem should, therefore, be capable of\ndistributed representation of information,\nmassively parallel processing, learning, and selforganization in order to achieve flexibility in\ninformation processing. Thus, Soft Computing\ncan be viewed as the key ingredient of RWC\nsystems. Several authors (e.g. [2]; [3]; [4]) have\ndiscussed the potentials of the soft computing\ntechniques in solving real world problems. Soft\nComputing has three basic components, namely,\nArtificial Neural Network, Fuzzy Logic, and\nGenetic Algorithm.\n\nPresent paper adopted Artificial Neural Network\nas predictive algorithm for monsoon rainfall over\nIndia.\nArtificial Neural Network in forecasting\natmospheric events- an overview\nANNs have recently become important\nalternative tool to conventional methods in\nmodelling complex non-linear relationships. In\nthe recent past, the ANN has been applied to\nmodel large data with large dimensionality.\nHu (1964) [5] initiated the implementation of\nArtificial Neural Network, an important Soft\nComputing methodology in weather forecasting.\nMcCann (1992) [6] developed Artificial Neural\nNetwork models to give 3-7 hr forecast of\nsignificant thunderstorms on the basis of surface\nbased lifted index and surface moisture\nconvergence. The two neural networks produced\nby them were combined operationally at\nNational Severe Storms Forecast Center, Kansas\nCity, Missouri to produce a single hourly product\nand was found to enhance the pattern recognition\nskill. Cook and Wolfe (1991) [7] developed a\nneural network to predict average air\ntemperatures. Zhang and Scofield (1994) [3]\napplied Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in\nprediction of rainfall through satellite data.\nData used in the present paper\nIn India, the months June, July, and August are\nidentified as the summer-monsoon months.\nThus, the present study explores the data of these\nthree months corresponding to the years 18711999. This paper develops ANN model step-bystep to predict the average rainfall over India\nduring summer- monsoon by exploring the data\navailable\nat\nthe\nwebsite\nhttp://www.tropmet.res.in published by Indian\nInstitute of Tropical Meteorology.\n2. IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTILAYER\nPERCEPTRON\nFeed forward neural network, also known as\nMultilayer Perceptron (MLP), has become\npopular tool for solving complex prediction as\nwell as classification problems. In general, a\nMulti Layer Perceptron consists of a lowermost\ninput layer, any number of hidden layers, and an\noutput layer at the top. In a network, the total\ninput received by neuron 'j' in (h + 1) th layer\nis defined as;\n\nInternational Conference on IT, HIT, March 19-21, 2007\n523\n\n\fX hj +1 = \u2211 Yi hW jih \u2212 \u03b8 jh +1\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nWhere, Yi h\n\u2192\nState of\nneuron in the preceding h th layer,\n\nW jih\n\n\u2192\n\nWeight\n\nth\n\nth\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nbetween i neuron of h layer and j\n(h + 1) th layer,\n\n\u03b8 jh +1\n\nthe\n\ni\n\nth\n\nconnection\nth\n\nneuron of\n\nThreshold of j th neuron in (h +\n\n\u2192\n\n1) layer.\nFor convenience, the threshold '\u03b8' is taken to be\nzero.\nEquation (1), thus, modifies to;\n\nX hj +1 = \u2211 Yi hW jih\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nWhere\n\n[{\n\nYi h = 1 / 1 + exp(\u2212 X hj\nFor\n\nh>0\n0\n= Xj\n\nFor\n\nh=0\n\n}]\n\nh\nThe values W ji are random values within [\u2212\n\n0.5, 0.5]. Perceptron of zero thresholds is more\nconvenient to deal with. This corresponds to\nlinear separations that are forced to pass through\nthe origin of the input space.\nTo develop the predictive model, the monsoon\nmonths' (June-August) data of year y have been\nused to predict the average monsoon rainfall of\nyear (y+1). First 75% of the available data are\nused as training set and the remaining 25% are\nused as the test set.\nThe multilayer perceptron model is framed with\nthe data set divided into test and training cases.\nThe test cases are arbitrarily chosen for the\navailable dataset so as to maintain the generality.\nThe model is trained up to 50 epochs. The\nlearning rate parameter is fixed at 0.4 and the\nmomentum rate is chosen 0.9. The weight matrix\nis framed with the values between \u20130.5 and 0.5.\nLeast mean squared error is chosen as the\nstopping\ncriteria for the learning procedure. In the present\nMultilayer Perceptron, 2 hidden layers are\nchosen and each hidden layer contains 2 nodes.\nA sequential learning procedure is adopted to\ntrain the perceptron. The final weight matrix is\nfound to be\n\n0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000\nHdn1_Nrn1 0.5563 0.5496 0.9791 0.5501\nHdn1_Nrn2 0.5081 0.5560 0.9159 0.5709\n1.0000 0.5081 0.5171\n0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000\nOp_bias\n0.2175 0.9678 0.9046 1.1770\nOp_Nrn1\n1.0000 0.7644\nAfter training the perceptron, the model is tested\nwith the chosen validation or test set. The\npredicted values and the associated predictor\nvalues are displayed in table1. To make the\nmodel output more understandable, the model\noutputs and the target outputs for the test cases\nare displayed in the figure 1.\n3. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\nPerformance of the model is evaluated through\ncomputation of overall prediction error (PE)\ndefined as\nHdn1_bias\n\nPE =\nWhere,\n\ny predicted \u2212 y actual\ny actual\n\n\u00d7 100\n\n(3)\n\nimplies average over the test cases.\n\nIn the present case, PE is 10.2%, that is, a small\noverall prediction error is being yielded by the\nperceptron model. Percentage errors of\nprediction in the individual test cases are\ndisplayed in figure 2. It is found that in 87.5%\ntest cases, the prediction error is less than 20%.\nThus, there is a high prediction yield.\nNow, the performance of the neural net model is\ncompared with conventional persistence forecast.\nIt is found through equation (3), that PE in the\ncase of persistence forecast is 18.3%. Therefore,\nNeural Net, in the form of Multilayer Perceptron\nis found to be adroit in the prediction of\nmonsoon rainfall over India.\n4. CONCLUSION\nPresent study concludes that Soft Computing as\nArtificial Neural Network can be of great use in\nprediction monsoon rainfall over India. If more\ninput parameters are available, then a prediction\nof higher accuracy would be possible.\n5.
