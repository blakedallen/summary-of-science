Introduction\nVX Sagittarii (HD 165674) is a cool semi-regular variable\nwith a long mean period of 732 days (Kholopov et al., 1987).\nLockwood & Wing (1982) reported a spectral type varying from\nM5.5 (near the time of visual maximum) to M9.8 (at minimum light). Lockwood & Wing (1982) determined that the effective temperature of VX Sgr is ranging between 3300 and\n2400 K (maximum to minimum light). Garc\u0131\u0301a-Hern\u00e1ndez et al.\n(2007) find T eff =2900 K at the time of their high-resolution spectroscopic observation, when the star was near minimum light\n\nSend offprint requests to: A. Chiavassa\n\u22c6\nBased on the observations made with VLTI-ESO Paranal, Chile under the programme IDs 081.D-0005(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)\n\n(AAVSO1 ). Lockwood & Wing (1982) found that VX Sgr exhibits stronger CN and VO bands with respect to Mira variables\nwith similar temperature. Enhanced CN absorption is an indicator of high luminosity in RSGs of earlier type and, together\nwith VO, also of S stars. Speck et al. (2000) categorized VX\nSgr as an oxygen-rich star and found a strong silicate feature at\n10 \u03bcm, that indicates a dusty circumstellar environment. Using\naperture-masking and IR/optical-telescope array interferometry\nat 2.16 \u03bcm, Monnier et al. (2004) revealed that VX Sgr exhibits\na dusty environment with a flux contribution of about 20% in the\nK band and some evidence of departure from circular symmetry,\neven if they could not place strong limits on possible asymmetries because of calibration uncertainties. The dusty environment\nis confirmed by HST images (Schuster et al., 2006). VX Sgr's\n1\n\nwww.aavso.org\n\n\f2\n\nA. Chiavassa et al.: VLTI/AMBER spectro-interferometric imaging of VX Sgr's inhomogenous outer atmosphere\n\ncircumstellar environment is the result of the heavy mass loss\nexperienced by the star (1.3 * 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , CO measurements;\nKnapp et al., 1989). The mass-loss process appears to be particularly asymmetric for the inner regions (Chapman & Cohen,\n1986). Using AAVSO data, Kamohara et al. (2005) show that\nthe optical light curve has a much smaller amplitude of about\n2 mag in the years 1998-2003, much less than the usual 6-7\nmag. An examination of AAVSO data shows that the decrease\nto this smaller amplitude has happened several times in the last\n70 years, and that the star is probably currently in that state.\nThe classification of VX Sgr as a red supergiant or an AGB is\nthus not firmly established. A further constraint can be brought\nby an estimate of its luminosity, in order to better ascertain\nits position in the HR diagram. Humphreys et al. (1972) placed\nVX Sgr in the vicinity of the Sgr OB1 cluster at 1.7 kpc;\nMurakawa et al. (2003) found 1.8\u00b10.5 kpc measuring the GHz\nH2 O maser expansion; Chen et al. (2007) reported a distance of\n1.57\u00b10.27 kpc using 43 GHz SiO maser proper motions; finally,\nthe trigonometric parallax of Hipparcos (van Leeuwen, 2007)\ngives a distance of 0.262(+0.655/-0.109) kpc, probably unreliable due to the size and asymmetry of the stellar photosphere.\nUsing AAVSO data, we find VX Sgr was at maximum luminosity during our observations, and we assume a T eff of 3200\nto 3400K. With the 2MASS K magnitude (Cutri et al., 2003),\nassuming a distance d=1.7 kpc, and using data for Galactic red\nsupergiants from Levesque et al. (2005), we derive a luminosity log L/L\u2299 = 5.25 \u00b1 0.25 (Mbol = \u22128.4 \u00b1 0.6). The error\nbar accounts for uncertainties in the photometry, and in the assumed T eff at the time of our observation, impacting the bolometric correction at K. Circumstellar emission in IR may increase further the luminosity by a few tenths of magnitude.\nPutting the star at 1.3 kpc would decrease the estimated luminosity to log L/L\u2299 = 5.00 \u00b1 0.25. The radius is then about\n1200 R\u2299 , and Av =2 to 4. This is a too high luminosity for\nan AGB star (e.g., Vassiliadis & Wood, 1993). Even compared\nto so-called super-AGB stars, where the most recent models\nshow a maximum of log L/L\u2299 \u2248 4.8 with typical masses ranging between \u2248 7 \u2212 11 M\u2299 (Siess, 2006) and log L/L\u2299 \u2248 5\n(Poelarends et al., 2008), VX Sgr's luminosity is extremely high.\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2009) found AGB stars with similar luminosities and masses of \u22486-7 M\u2299 showing Rb enhancement\nin the Magellanic Clouds, and they argue that these AGB stars\nmay be more luminous due to a contribution from Hot Bottom\nBurning. However, Garc\u0131\u0301a-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (2007), using synthetic spectra based on classical hydrostatic model atmospheres\nfor cool stars with extensive line lists, found VX Sgr to be the\nonly not Li-rich, long-period, high OH expansion velocity star\nof their Galactic AGB sample. On the other hand VX Sgr's low\neffective temperature, and large V variability are quite untypical for an RSG, although Levesque et al. (2007) found highvariability, low-T eff RSGs in the Magellanic Clouds. Heger et al.\n(1997) studied the pulsations properties in red supergiants from\n10 to 20 M\u2299 with high luminosity to mass ratio and show that\nvery large pulsation periods, amplitudes and mass-loss rates may\nbe expected to occur at and beyond central helium ex-haustion\nover the time-scale of the last few 104 years. This could lead to\nan overall dimming of the star after a period of stronger oscillations subsequent to enhanced mass-loss and ejection of a dust\nshell that screens the stellar radiation.\nIt appears that the evolutionary status of VX Sgr is still not well\nestablished, and more investigations are needed. In particular its\nchemical composition should be scrutinized.\nWe discuss here interferometric observations of VX Sgr\nmade with the VLTI/AMBER instrument in the near IR. The aim\n\nof this paper is to study the continuum forming photosphere, the\nexistence, and the characterization of molecular layers of VX\nSgr probing different wavelengths in the H and K bands.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nWe obtained near-infrared interferometry data of VX Sgr\nwith the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI,\nHaguenauer et al., 2008) using the near-infrared beam combiner\nAMBER (Petrov et al., 2007) that simultaneously covers the\nJ, H, and K bands with a spectral resolution of \u2248 35. VX\nSgr has been observed in less than 1.5 months using the AT\nconfigurations: A0-D0-H0, D0-H0-G1 and E0-G0-H0. The\nfringe tracker FINITO (Le Bouquin et al., 2008) has been\nused for all the observations. In addition to the science target,\nthree calibrator stars have been observed close in time and\ninterleaved with VX Sgr: HD169916 (K0IV), HD146545\n(K5III) and HD166295 (K2III/IV). The calibrator diameters\nwere retrieved from Richichi et al. (2005), Bord\u00e9 et al. (2002)\nand Richichi & Percheron (2002). The diameter errors are\nof the order of 1%. Details are reported in Table 1 with the\nprojected baseline lengths (B p ), the position angles (PA p ), the\nspectral interval, the calibrators used, the optical seeing, and the\ncoherence time.\nRaw visibilities and closure phases were computed with the\nlatest version of the amdlib package (release 2.2, Tatulli et al.,\n2007) and the yorick interface provided by the Jean-Marie\nMariotti Center. Individual frames were averaged after selecting the 20% best frames based on the fringe SNR only and with\na piston smaller than \u00b120 \u03bcm. We decided to discard J band\nfringes because the data quality was significantly worse than for\nlonger wavelengths.\nIn addition we used the addons by Millour et al. (2008, release 1.53) to calibrate the datasets. The transfer function measurement for one night is shown in Fig. 1. Both science and calibrator targets have the same detector integration time of 0.05\nms, and after the calibration, VX Sgr data have been averaged.\nThe error bars on the calibrated visibilities include the statistical\nerror of averaging the single frames, the errors of the calibration stars' angular diameters, and the scatter of the transfer function measurements. This scatter (top panel of Fig. 1) is much\nlarger than the internal errors, computed by the reduction software. This basically means that the visibilities errors (between\n0.05 and 0.1) we use in this paper reflect calibration issues affecting simultaneously a whole range of wavelengths, while the\nwavelength-to-wavelength error is much smaller (typically 0.01\nto 0.05): while the visibility errors seem large in a single dataset,\nthe wavelength-variation errors of the same dataset are small.\nThe absolute wavelength correction has been done using\nthe telluric Kitt Peak spectra which we convolved to match the\nspectral resolution of the AMBER data. In VX Sgr data, the\nband gaps (i.e., between J and H and H and K) are visible and\nwe made a linear two-component adjustment of the wavelength\nscale which gave a systematic offset of -0.21 \u03bcm with respect to\nthe initial AMBER table and a 7% wavelength stretch.\nFig. 2 shows the final UV-plane coverage of all observations that successfully passed all steps of the data reduction and\ncalibration quality control. The north-west south-east direction\nis not completely covered because of the actual AT geometry,\nwhile the east-west direction is particularly favored. The star\nexhibits large wavelength-dependent visibilities and has a clear\nnon-zero, non-180\u25e6 closure phase (bottom panel of Fig. 1), evidencing asymmetries in the intensity distribution.\n\n\fA.

Image reconstruction\nThe first step in our analysis is a chromatic image reconstruction of our data to probe different layers in the photosphere and\nabove.\nThe image reconstruction process is similar to the one performed for T Lep in Le Bouquin et al. (2009). For the recon-\n\nstruction, we use the MIRA software package (Thi\u00e9baut, 2008;\nCotton et al., 2008; Le Besnerais et al., 2008). The image is\nsought by minimizing a so-called cost function which is the sum\nof a regularization term plus data-related terms. The data terms\nenforce agreement of the model image with the measured data\n(visibilities). The regularization term is a \u03c72 minimization between the reconstructed image and an expected image. The expected image is issued from a preliminary image reconstruction,\nstrongly constrained by the assumption of circularity. Each spectral bin has been processed independently (Fig. 3, left column).\nThe reconstructed images clearly highlight different behaviors\nacross the wavelength range: in the H band (\u2248 1.45 \u2212 1.80 \u03bcm),\nthe intensity distribution is inhomogeneous and a bifurcation of\nthe image core into a few bright \"spots\" is visible; at \u2248 2.00\n\u03bcm and at the upper K band edge (\u2248 2.35 \u2212 2.50 \u03bcm) the radius\nappears extended and much larger than in the H band. Artifacts\nmay be introduced by the poor UV-plane coverage in one direction (north-west south-east, see Fig 2). However, the detection\n\n\f4\n\nA.

Chiavassa et al.: VLTI/AMBER spectro-interferometric imaging of VX Sgr's inhomogenous outer atmosphere\n\nof inhomogeneities is out of doubt because there are clear signatures in the closure phases (Fig. 1).\n\nThe reconstructed images are not good enough to firmly establish the presence of inhomogeneities on VX Sgr's photosphere\nbecause the different sources of errors can smooth out the information. Thus, in order to confirm their presence and to constrain\ntheir flux relative to the total flux, we used a model-fitting approach. We approximated the star with a uniform disk and its\nextended shells by a Gaussian disk, and we added a series of\npoint sources to model the spots. We performed a fit using all the\nobserved wavelengths together, but used five regularly spaced\nreference wavelengths to effectively compute the model (1.54,\n1.78, 2.03, 2.28, and 2.52 \u03bcm). To match the data with the model,\nwe interpolated the parameters for other wavelengths using cubic spline interpolation. The global optimum of the fit was found\nusing a set of simulated annealing algorithms complemented by\nstandard gradient descent algorithms (see Millour et al., 2009,\nfor a first application of this approach). A model with three spots\n(i.e., performing a fit with a uniform disk, a Gaussian disk, and\nthree spots) significantly enhance the fit (\u03c72 \u2248 25), especially\nfor the visibilities and closure phases up to spatial frequency of\n\u2248 240 cycles/arcsec. Spatial frequencies above this value correspond to a single measurement at the largest baseline length. The\ndetails about the fits are reported in Table 2.\nOur toy model is probably not perfectly describing the object\nat the highest angular resolution available, but gives a resonable\nfit to intermediate angular resolutions. We also note that two of\nthe bright spots are located at the position of the stellar disk, and\none has to be outside the stellar disk in order to fit the observed\nclosure phases. We estimate that the upper value of the spots'\nflux is \u2264 10% of the total flux and that the flux of the spot located outside the photosphere has very likely a flux equal to zero\nin the H band. Fig. 3 (right column) displays the appearance of\nthe toy model at some selected wavelengths. As a final remark,\nthese images resemble the reconstructed images in the left column of the figure. We also note that the bright spot located outside the photosphere is particularly visible in the lower right part\nof each panel of the reconstructed images at lower wavelength\nand somehow less evident at longer wavelength even if it is expected by the geometrical model.\nWhat we can conclude from this model-fitting approach is\nthe following:\n\u2013 a model with three spots can explain the visibilities and\nclosure phases for spatial frequencies \u2264 240 cycles/arcsec.\nHigher spatial frequencies are probed in our dataset by only\none observation and indicate a more complicated object\nshape at smaller scales;\n\u2013 The best-fitting model locates two of the spots inside the supposed photosphere of the star, but the third spot, mandatory\nto explain the closure phase deviations, is located outside the\nphotosphere and it is brighter at longer wavelenths;\n\u2013 The spots have individual fluxes which, at all wavelengths,\ndo not exceed 10% of the total flux of the star, for all wavelengths.\n\n5. Model fitting\nThe visibility data of VX Sgr show significant wavelengthdependent features. We fitted the visibility curves and the closure\nphases using a Gaussian disk for each spectral channel, which\n\n14\nGaussian FWHM (mas)\n\n4.

Figure 4\nillustrates the change of apparent size with wavelength. This\nis consistent with what is visible in the reconstructed images\n(Fig. 3): the radius gets larger between 1.8 and 2.1 \u03bcm, reaching local maximum at 2.0 \u03bcm, then gets smaller again to a minimum around 2.15 to 2.25 \u03bcm, eventually it becomes much larger\ntoward 2.5 \u03bcm. However, Fig. 4 gives only a rough idea of the\napparent diameter of VX Sgr because the intensity profile is not\na Gaussian disk.\nTo reproduce the wavelength dependence, we used the onedimensional dynamic models of Ireland et al. (2004a,b) for\noxygen-rich Mira stars that include the effect of molecular layers\nin the outer atmosphere. These are self-excited dynamic models whose grey atmospheric temperature stratification was recomputed on the basis of non-grey extinction coefficients that\ncontain all relevant molecular absorbers (e.g., H2 O, CO, TiO;\nsolar abundances) but do not contain dust. The stellar parameters were assumed to be close to those of the M-type Mira prototypes o Cet and R Leo. This model series has been successfully\nused by Wittkowski et al. (2007, 2008) to explain AMBER observation of the Mira star S Ori. Due to the poorly understanding of the VX Sgr stellar parameters, there is no fully consistent\nmodel of this star, and the models we used can show only typical\ncharacteristics of such a star. Figure 5 shows the comparison for\nshort (left and central panels) and long (right panel) projected\nbaselines. The wavelength dependence of the visibility is similar\nfor all the nights.\nFor the fit, we followed the fitting procedure used by\nWittkowski et al. (2008) and used only the short baseline data\nobtained with E0-G0-H0, because we do not expect to match\ndetails of the intensity profile probed at high spatial frequencies\nwith the M series that has not been designed to match a star\nlike VX Sgr . The dynamic models predict large changes in the\nmonochromatic radius caused by the molecular layers above the\ncontinuum-forming region in the stellar photosphere. The bandpasses around 1.9 and 2.5 \u03bcm are significantly affected by H2 O\nmolecules with some contribution of CO in the H band and in\nthe long-wavelength part K band. The molecular-band effects\nchange significantly with phase as shown in Wittkowski et al.\n(2008). The model M18 (see Table 3) provides the best fit to the\n\n\f6\n\nA.

Left and central panels belong to the night 2008-06-07, and the right panel is for the\nnight 2008-07-03.\n\nVX Sgr data among the 20 available phase and cycle combinations of the M series.\nThe M model qualitatively explains the overall wavelength\ndependence of the apparent stellar radius (Fig. 5, solid black\nline). However, while the fit is very good at short baselines, the\ncomparison is less good at long baselines. Two reasons can explain this discrepancy: (i) the stellar parameters of the M models\nare not well suited for VX Sgr, (ii) there are some surface inhomogeneities detected in the data, that are not in the M model.\nThe angular photospheric diameter corresponding to the reference radius at 1.04 \u03bcm is \u0398M18 = 8.82 \u00b1 0.43 mas for short baselines where the fit is better. The error on the diameter includes\nsystematic calibration and model uncertainties. This result is in\nagreement to what has been found by Monnier et al. (2004),\n\n\u03982.16\u03bcm = 8.7 \u00b1 0.4 mas. However, our models do not include\ndust while Monnier et al. found a dusty environment around the\nstar with a flux contribution of about 20% in the K band.\nWe also fitted Gaussian FWHM values to the synthetic visibility values based on the M18 model intensity profiles for each\nspectral channel, using the same procedure that was used to fit\nthe measured data. The comparison between the fit to the M18\nmodel intensity profiles and the fit to the measured data is shown\nin Fig. 4.\nThe available Mira models show good agreement with VX\nSgr's data. However, this comparison can just give a basic qualitative picture of VX Sgr's surface and more detailed interpretations of these data must be addressed to next generation models\n\n\fA.

Complementary comparison with\nthree-dimensional simulations\nIn this section, we quantify if the observed asymmetries are consistent with three-dimensional simulations of surface convection in RSG and AGB stars, and if their chaotic photospheric\nstructure is adequate to explain the different surface layers structures observed. The simulation are carried out with CO5 BOLD\n(Freytag et al., 2002; Freytag and H\u00f6fner, 2008). Parameters of\nthe models are given in Table 3. The pulsations are not artificially added to the models (e.g. by a piston) but are self-excited.\nExcitation by not-stationary sonic convective motions are responsible for the pulsations. Molecular opacities are taken into\naccount, but radiation transport is treated in grey approximation,\nignoring radiation pressure and dust opacities. Dynamical pressure lets the density drop much slower than expected for a hydrostatic atmosphere. In our 3D simulations, the average density\ndrops exponentially, and there is no sign of a wind or an extended shell with relatively large densities. Some more technical information can be found in Freytag and H\u00f6fner (2008), the\nCO5 BOLD Online User Manual2 , and in a forthcoming paper by\nFreytag (2010, in prep.).\nWe computed \u2248 3500 synthetic images from these simulations at the same wavelengths of the observations using our 3D\nradiative transfer code OPTIM3D (Chiavassa et al., 2009). Then,\nwe generated visibility curves using the method described by\nChiavassa et al.. In the case of the RSG simulation, the synthetic\nimages do not change strongly in diameter, shape and asymmetries across the wavelength range of the observations, and, hence,\nthe observed wavelength dependence of the visibility is not explained by this approach (blue triangles in Fig. 5). The synthetic\nimages of the AGB simulation show a noticeable wavelength\ndependence and their agreement with the observed visibilities is\nslightly better than the RSG model, in particular at short baselines (left and central panel, blue dots of Fig. 5). Nevertheless,\nthe two 3D simulations analyzed do not provide a better fit to\nour AMBER data than the Mira models described in Sect. 5.\nAt last, in order to explain the detected spots on the surface\nof the reconstructed images (Fig. 3), we compare the synthetic\nimages corresponding to the best-fitting visibility curves of the\n3D simulations (see Fig. 5) to the reconstructed image at 1.6 \u03bcm\n(Fig 6). This wavelength corresponds roughly to the H\u22121 continuous opacity minimum (i.e., the photosphere becomes more\ntransparent). The reconstructed image shows two spots on the\n2\n\nwww.astro.uu.se/ \u0303bf/co5bold main.html\n\nFig. 6. Reconstructed image at 1.6 \u03bcm with the intensity normalized to the range [0, 1] and plotted as I 0.33 . The contour lines are\nthe same as in Fig. 3.\nsurface. Figure 7 displays the synthetic images of the RSG star\nwhich show large convective cells (\u2248 4 \u2212 5 mas), and on top\nof that there are small-scale granules (\u2248 0.5 \u2212 1 mas). The observed visibility points do not show a good agreement especially\nat long baselines where the expected signal is much lower than\nthe simulation's predictions.\nThe AGB star (Fig. 7) displays a pulsating stellar atmosphere\nwith strong asymmetric structures caused by the shocks; the convective envelope is hardly visible because of the optical thickness of the atmosphere even without the inclusion of the dust\nopacity tables (Freytag and H\u00f6fner, 2008). The AGB's visibilities and closure phases show large departures from symmetry\nalready in the first lobe, but even in this case, the long baseline\ndata points cannot be explained.\nThe presence of spots on the reconstructed image of VX Sgr\ncan be qualitatively explained by the synthetic images, even if\nthe distribution of the spots in our simulations has little chance\nto be exactly the one we observed with AMBER. Unfortunately,\nwe cannot constrain the 3D simulations in term of surface intensity contrast using these observations because we could not\ndetermine an accurate value for the spots' flux level (Table 2).\n\n7. Conclusions\nOur AMBER observations unveil, for the first time, the shape of\nVX Sgr's surface.\nThe individual wavelength image reconstruction has been\ncarried out using the MIRA software. VX Sgr displays visibilities and images with strong wavelength dependence: (i) surface\nasymmetries in the H band (\u2248 1.45 \u2212 1.80 \u03bcm) and (ii) an extended radius at \u2248 2 and 2.35-2.50 \u03bcm. We find that a geometrical toy model composed of a uniform disk plus a Gaussian disk,\nand three spots gives a reasonable fit for the AMBER data. We\nclaim that at least two spots are present on the photosphere of\nVX Sgr, and we show that this is qualitatively predicted by 3D\nhydrodynamical simulations of stellar convection. In addition,\nthe toy model shows that one spot resides outside the photosphere and it is brighter at longer wavelengths. The presence\nof this spot located outside the photosphere could be related to\na complex and irregular structure in the surrounding of VX Sgr\nas already detected by Kervella et al. (2009) for the RSG alpha\nOri. Also the two bright spots which appear at the position on\n\n\f8\n\nA.

The dashed lines indicate\nthe minimum and maximum amplitude of variations of the visibilities and closure phases issued from different rotations of the\nimage. In bottom right panel, the axisymmetric case is represented by the solid lines.\nthe photosphere may both originate at the depth of the continuum photosphere, or higher up in the molecular layers. In fact,\nthese spots appear at all wavelengths (Fig. 3), also at the water\nbands, which hide a large part of the continuum photosphere.\nThis might be a hint that they originate in the molecular layers\nfar above the continuum photosphere.\nWe used 1D dynamical oxygen-rich Mira model predictions\nto explain the visibility data points, and we found that the fit is\nvery good at short baselines. We conclude that H2 O molecules\nstrongly affect the visibility, and thus this molecule seems to be\na dominant absorber in the molecular layers. The atmospheric\nstructure of VX Sgr seems to qualitatively resemble Mira-star\nmodels which show molecular layers above the continuum forming layer. In addition, its photosphere shows bright spots that\ncan be related to giant-cell surface convection and possibly to\nthe molecular layer. However, we must point out that the Mira\nmodel used here has stellar parameters that are not consistent\nwith what we expect for VX Sgr, and there are only observations from a single epoch to do the interpretation. Due to various\nuncertainties, the classification of VX Sgr must be further investigated in the near future by, firstly, combining multi-epochs\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations to better determine\nits stellar parameters; and secondly, by observing with interferometers at higher spectral resolution to study in greater detail the\n\nchanges across the H and K bands using new theoretical models\nwith consistent stellar parameters.\nAcknowledgements.
