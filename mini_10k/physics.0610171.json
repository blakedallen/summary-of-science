INTRODUCTION\nSpeech motor control has been often compared with\nthe control of other skilled human movements such as\npointing or grasping [1]. This approach was very helpful\nand permitted the elaboration of important hypotheses\nthat were the basis of major speech production theories.\nHowever, a peculiarity of speech movement has been\noften overseen, namely the fact that speech articulators,\nand especially the tongue, are not moving in a free space.\nIndeed, the vocal tract is a very narrow space, and tongue\nis most of the time in mechanical interaction with\nexternal structures, such as the palate or/and the teeth.\nHamlet & Stone [2] and Fuchs et al. [3] have found a\nnumber of evidences supporting the hypothesis that these\nexternal structures would be integrated in speech motor\ncontrol strategies, and would, consequently, significantly\ncontribute to the control of speech movement accuracy.\nNow, two questions can be raised:\n(1)\nWhat is the quantitative nature of the\ninteraction between tongue and external\nstructures? In other words, are these structures\nonly geometrical limits of the space in which\ntongue is allowed to move, or are they\nmechanical objects that are actually used to\nposition and shape the tongue?\n(2)\nWhat are the changes in speech motor control\nstrategies induced by dramatic modifications\nof these external structures, as it is the case for\ninstance for edentulous people?\n\nQuantitative measurements of the intensity of the force\nexerted by the tongue on the teeth provide an interesting\nbasis to address these issues. In addition, this technique\nprovides interesting information about the order of\nmagnitude of the intensity of muscular forces involved in\nthe generation of tongue movements during speech\nproduction.\nIn this aim, a number of experimental set-ups have\nbeen developed in the past to measure tongue pressure\nagainst the palate in various experimental conditions [4].\nThe limits of these techniques, beside the inherent\ncomplexity of their calibration, lie in the fact that they\nactually induce slight perturbations of the speech\nproduction, because they modify the geometry of the\nvocal tract. Honda et al. [5] have shown that speakers can\ncompensate quite easily and quite quickly for brutal\nchanges in the thickness of an inflated palate, in that\nsense that they could adapt tongue positions in reference\nto the variable palatal shapes. However, it is not clear\nwhether the intensity of the palate/tongue interaction was\nor not affected by these brutal changes.\nIn this paper, we will present a new experimental\nprocedure that aims\n(1) at measuring the interaction between tongue, teeth\nand palate without perturbing the production of speech,\nand\n(2) at studying how speech motor control strategies\nevolve for edentulous people, from the moment where an\nartificial denture is put back in the mouth. Finally,\npreliminary results of a pilot study will be presented.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DEVICE AND METHODS\nThe basic principle and the originality of the method\npresented in this paper is to use edentulous people as\nsubjects, and to insert pressure sensors in their complete\ndental prosthesis, in such a way that the geometry of the\nvocal tract remains exactly the same as when their normal\ndental prosthesis is in place.\nA. Experimental device\nGeneral description\nThe complete denture, in which the pressure sensor is\nincluded, is placed inside the mouth. A sheath goes from\nthe premolar area to the connector placed outside the\nmouth, via the labial commissure. Then, a wire goes from\nthe connector to the amplifier, from the connector to a\ndata sampling board and then to the computer.\n\n\fA microphone is also connected to an amplifier to\nrecord the acoustic speech signal simultaneously with the\npressure exerted by the tongue against the palate and/or\nthe teeth. This amplifier is in turn linked to the data\nsampling board.\nDescription of the complete dental prosthesis\nThe dental prosthesis is made of resin and consists of\ncomplete artificial denture and of an artificial palate.\nArtificial teeth are similar in shape and size to natural\nteeth. The artificial palate must be at least 3mm thick to\navoid breakage. Hence, both the pressure sensor and the\nwires connecting it with the connector outside of the\nmouth can be easily inserted in the prosthesis, without\ncreating any additional change of the oral cavity (fig. 1).\nFor each edentulous patient, the dental prosthesis that\nis designed for obvious medical purposes is accurately\nduplicated thanks to a specific prosthesis design\ntechnique. Several duplicates are thus realized, in order to\nhave different possible positions for the pressure sensor.\nThus, the sensor can be inserted in the prostheses before\nthe experiment with the patient, and no time is wasted\nduring the experiment itself, when the tongue palate/teeth\ninteraction is measured at different locations.\n\nSensor\n\nWire inserted in the resin\nFigure 1: Complete dental prosthesis with a sensor\ninserted in a front incisor. The wire connecting the\nsensor to the external connector can be seen on the\nright hand side of the picture, at the level of the first\npremolar. It goes then to the sensor inside the\nstructure of the palate.\nPressure sensor description\nThe sensor is made of a strain gauge sensor which is\ncomposed of thirteen layers (fig. 2). Each layer plays an\nimportant role in measuring capabilities of the transducer.\nThe intraoral area is a very difficult environment\nmainly because of three factors:\n\u2022 Permanent moisture due to saliva\n\n\u2022 Variable temperature\n\u2022 Mechanical constrains\nTherefore, the sensor must be electrically insulated and\nwater proof. Moreover, it must be sturdy in order to go\nthrough several experiments.\n\n3m\nm\n\n5mm\n\nFigure 2: The 13 layers of the pressure sensor\nThe middle layer is made of a steel cantilever beam\nwhich is 10/100 mm thick. It supports on each side an\nactive strain gauge. The gauges (Vishay, ref EA06 062\nAQ 350) are placed in a half Wheatstone bridge\nconfiguration.. This strain gauge has been chosen because\nof its stability in temperature.\nGauges are bonded on a metallic support with MBond 200 adhesive (Vishay measurement group). Wires\nof 0,1mm diameter are soldered with tin on the gauge.\nThe area of solder is 1mm2 small and there are 4 points, 2\nby side.\nThe two next layers are made of protective coating. MCoat A (Vishay measurement\ngroup).\n3mm\nIn any case, during the\nconstruction, the thickness of all\nthe liquid components such as\nprotective coating or bonding\nmust be very small, in order to\npreserve\nthe\nmechanical\nproperties\nof\nthe\nsensor.\nConsequently just one application\nof each component by layer can\nbe done.\nFigure 3 shows a detailed\npicture of such a sensor.\n\n5mm\n\nFigure 3: The pressure sensor connected to its wire.\n\n\fAssociated instrumentation tools:\nBefore sampling the signal goes through an amplifier\n(2100 series by Vishay Measurement) featuring a digital\ncontrol display and different settings possibilities with\n2100 maximal gain range and a bandwidth of 5kHz (at\n0,5dB, and 15 kHz at -3 dB). It can hold up to two\ntransducers.\nTo record the acoustic signal, a microphone is placed\nnear the patient. It is linked with an amplifier and then\nwith the data sampling board (DT 9800 series by Data\ntranslation) that is connected directly to the host\ncomputer via an USB port. This board can accept up to\n16 analog inputs that can be simultaneously sampled at\ndifferent rates (from 50 Hz to 20 000 Hz). For these\nexperiments, 2 or 3 inputs are used: one for the acoustic\nsignal and one or two for the tongue pressure.\n\n- The second device called \"dried water column\"\nconverts electric signals into pressure.\nThe weight of a water column is applied on the whole\nsurface of the sensor. A latex membrane which is not\ntensed (to avoid signal due of it) is attached to the end of\nthe column and is in contact with the sensor. The electric\nsignal is compared to the level of water. This is a nice\nway to account for the soft body characteristics of the\ntongue, and to give an idea of the pressure at contact\nlocation. However, it does not model the true viscoelastic\ncharacteristics of the tongue. Consequently, the\nconversion from sensor displacement to contact pressure\ndoes not strictly apply to the contact between tongue and\nteeth and palate.\nIn both cases, the calibration of the sensors has to be\ndone very carefully and to be explained in order to know\nwhat kind of information can be extracted from the data.\n\nB. Methods\nPalatography\nPressure sensor calibration\nSince the transducers are handmade, some differences\ncan exist between them. Therefore, they have to be\ncalibrated individually to convert electric signals into\nmechanical units such as strength or pressure.\nThe soft body characteristics of the tongue suggests\nthat pressure should be more appropriate. Indeed, due to\nthe tongue deformation in contact with a solid structure,\nthe contact area is always large and can't be reduced to a\nspecific point. However, the transformation of the sensor\ndisplacement into mechanical pressure is not obvious,\nbecause of the visco-elastic properties of the tongue.\nIndeed, in case of contact with external structures, the\nshape of the tongue varies over time and this variation is\nstrongly dependent of the visco-elastic properties of the\ntongue. Hence, establishing a good approximation of the\nrelation between the strain exerted on the sensor and the\ncontact pressure is not a simple task. In this aim, we\ndesigned and tested 2 different devices to calibrate the\nsensors:\n- The first device uses weights to convert electrical\nsignals into strength.\nThis is the fastest and easiest way to calibrate the\ntransducer. Small lead beads hanging out of the middle\nof the edge of the steel cantilever beam were used.\nSince the weight of the lead is known, the electric\nsignal can be converted into mechanical strength. This\nallows an evaluation of the intensity of the mechanical\ninteraction, as well as a comparison of them under\ndifferent experimental conditions. However, it is not a\ngood approach to quantitatively asses their absolute\nvalues of the pressure at contact location.\n\nIn order to know with enough accuracy where the\nsensors should be inserted to measure tongue-palate/teeth\ninteraction during speech production, the exact locations\nof the main contact regions have to be determined. [6].\nThis is why, during a preliminary session, palatographic\nrecordings are carried out, with the prosthesis in the\nmouth\n\nFigure 4: Tongue contacts regions on the prosthesis\nobtained with palatography for /t/ (left) and /d/\n(right), and for a female subject in a pilot experiment.\nWith complete dental prostheses, electropalatagraphy\n(EPG) can not be used because of obvious\nincompatibility reasons between the prosthesis and the\nEPG device [7]. Therefore, pink powder (occlusion spray\nred \"okklufine premiumTM\") is applied on the teeth and\non the artificial palate. When tongue is in contact with\none of these structures, the powder is removed from the\narea of contact. Thus, when the subject is asked to\npronounce a specific phoneme in isolation, the edges of\nthe contact areas can be determined for this phoneme.\nThese edges are highlighted with a black pen before\nremoving the powder. This technique is not as accurate as\n\n\fEPG, but accurate enough to determined where to set the\nsensor when tongue and palate/teeth interaction is\ninvestigated for this phoneme.\nFigure 4 shows an example of the results thus obtained\nduring the production of the alveolar stops /t/ and /d/, for\na female subject in a pilot experiment.\nData acquisition\nAs exemplified above, for each subject, each prosthesis\nis dedicated to the measurement of tongue \u2013 palate/teeth\ninteractions in a vocal tract region that is strongly related\nto the production of a specific phoneme. Sounds are\nrepeated several times by the subjects both in isolation\nand within short carrier sentences such as, for the alveolar\nstop /t/, \"toto a t\u00eat\u00e9 sa t\u00e9tine\".\nFor each sound, according to the palatography results,\nthe transducers are placed in the specified area.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\nAn original device for the measurement of the\nmechanical interaction between tongue and teeth and/or\npalate was presented. It adapted to a specific kind of\nsubjects, namely edentulous patients. Using the complete\ndental prosthesis to insert force sensors, the device\npermits the measurement of contact pressure without\nintroducing any additional perturbation than the\nprosthesis it self.\nThis experimental setup will permit to study speech\nproduction either by patients who have been wearing\ntheir prosthesis for years and have completed the\nadaptation process to it, or by patients that just received\nthe prosthesis, in order to study how they adapt to its new\ndenture..\n\nIII. RESULTS\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFigure 5 shows an example of results obtained for /d/\nin a pilot study carried out with an 80 years old female\nsubject. The sensor was inserted in the most front contact\narea measured with palatography (see fig. 4, right panel).\nIt can be seen that the acoustic release of the stops is\nwell-synchronized with the abrupt decrease of tongue\npressure in the palate.
