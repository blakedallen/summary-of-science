The outburst that started in that year has continued to\nthe present day, with no sign of an imminent decline. The binary comprises a 14 \u00b1 4.4 M\u2299 black hole accreting from a companion of about a solar mass (Harlaftis & Greiner 2004), and remains the brightest accreting black hole in the galaxy, spending much of its time at a super-Eddington X-ray luminosity\n(Done, Wardzinski & Gierlinski 2004).\nThe unusually long outburst is over 20 times longer than any\nother black hole X-ray transient outburst. The duration is linked to\nthe size of the accretion disc, which is very large: GRS1915+105\nhas an extremely long orbital period of 33.5 days, and as such the\ndisc will have a radius of several 1012 cm. However, the reservoir of\nmass in the disc that is available to fuel an outburst is finite, and in\nthis work we use a simple calculation to show how long the outburst\nis likely to continue if the current mean accretion rate is maintained.\nWe present this calculation in Sections 2 and 3 below. In Sections\n4 and 5, we discuss the implications for our understanding of the\naccretion process in X-ray transients.\n\n2 FUELLING THE OUTBURST\nAssuming that the outburst of GRS1915+105 is fuelled by the accretion of gas contained in a disc, an absolute upper limit for the\noutburst duration can be found by considering the time taken to accrete the entire reservoir of mass. Done, Wardzinski & Gierlinski\n\u22c6\n\nm.r.truss@durham.ac.uk\n\n(2004) made a simple estimate for the outburst duration of 10 years,\nbased on an outer disc radius Rdisc \u223c 1012 cm. Clearly, this duration has been exceeded and this is the motivation for undertaking a\nmore detailed calculation. We begin by considering the maximum\navailable disc mass. The outburst duration will be given by\ntmax =\n\nMdisc\n,\nh\u1e40disc i\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Mdisc is the mass of the accretion disc at the beginning of\nthe outburst. We assume that the mass transfer rate from the donor\nstar, \u2212\u1e402 , remains constant throughout the outburst and consider a\ntime-averaged central accretion rate onto the black hole, h\u1e401 i and\na time-averaged wind mass loss rate h\u1e40wind i. The time-averaged\nrate of mass loss from the accretion disc is then\nh\u1e40disc i = h\u1e401 i + h\u1e40wind i \u2212 \u1e402 .\n\n(2)\n\nGRS1915+105 spends much of its time radiating with a superEddington luminosity (Done, Wardzinski & Gierlinski 2004), so\nwe infer that the mass accretion rate is consistently very high. Assuming a distance d = 12.5 kpc (Greiner, Cuby & McCaughrean\n(2001), see the discussion in Section 4), the mean luminosity\nis close to Eddington (Done, Wardzinski & Gierlinski 2004, Figure 5), implying a mass accretion rate at the black hole of order\n\u1e40Edd \u223c 2 \u00d7 1019 gs\u22121 . This is much larger than the estimate for\nthe mass transfer rate from the companion, even taking into account\nits evolved nature. We use the formula for mass transfer driven by\nnuclear evolution given in equation 6 of King et al. (1997), which\nfor the parameters of GRS1915+105 and a core mass of 0.28 M\u2299\n(Vilhu 2002) gives \u2212\u1e402 \u2243 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 = 6.3 \u00d7 1017 gs\u22121 .\nWe now wish to estimate the mass of the disc at the start of the\noutburst. Ideally, this would be determined from the duration of an\ninterval of quiescence, but this is not possible with GRS1915+105.\nOnly one outburst has ever been observed - the current one - and\n\n\f2\n\nM. R. Truss and C. Done\n\nthe quiescent interval for such a large disc is likely to be centuries.\nTherefore, we must assume an appropriate surface density profile\nfor the disc, \u03a3(R), at the onset of an outburst.\nThe mass of the disc is given by\nZ Rdisc\nMdisc =\n2\u03c0R\u03a3(R) dR,\n(3)\n0\n\nand we assume that the surface density at all radii in the disc is\nequal to the critical surface density required to trigger an outburst\nvia the thermal-viscous instability:\n1.05\n\u03a3 = \u03a3max = 11.4\u03b1\u22120.86\nM1\u22120.35 R10\nc\n\n(4)\n\n(Cannizzo, Shafter & Wheeler 1988), where R10 is the radius in\nunits of 1010 cm. We take the masses M1 = 14 M\u2299 , M2 = 1 M\u2299\nand a cool state viscosity \u03b1c = 0.02. We discuss the effects of taking different values for these parameters in Section 4. Integrating\nequation 3, we are left with\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u0011\u22120.86 \u0012 M \u0013\u22120.35\nc\n1\n3.05\nMdisc = 3.4 \u00d7 1028\nRdisc,12\ng (5)\n0.02\n14\nwhere the radius is now scaled to units of 1012 cm.\nIt is not immediately clear how to make a secure estimate for\nthe maximum outer radius of the disc in quiescence. The maximum\npossible streamline radius in the three-body model of Paczy\u0144ski\n(1977) is about 0.5a. For Porb = 33.5 d and M1 + M2 = 15 M\u2299 ,\nthe binary separation a = 7.5 \u00d7 1012 cm so this estimate for the\nradius gives Rdisc \u2243 3.7\u00d71012 cm. However, this is likely to be an\noverestimate. Taking a cue from low mass ratio cataclysmic variables, the radius of the disc in quiescence is always much less than\nthe maximum streamline radius, only approaching it as the disc expands in the hot, highly eccentric outburst state. A more realistic\nestimate for the disc radius in a quiescent X-ray transient is given\nby Shahbaz, Charles & King (1998), who use angular momentum\nconservation arguments to show that in the case of negligible accretion onto the primary, Rdisc = 1.36Rcirc . An expression for the\ncircularisation radius Rcirc is given by\nRcirc\n= 0.0859q \u22120.426\n(6)\na\n(Hessman & Hopp 1990), which is accurate for 0.05 6 q < 1. For\n1\nq = 14\n, we have Rcirc = 0.26a, giving us the refined estimate\nRdisc = 2.7 \u00d7 1012 cm.\nFor Rdisc,12 = 2.7, equation 5 gives an estimate for the\ndisc mass Mdisc = 7.0 \u00d7 1029 g. It follows from equations 1\nand 2 that the time taken to accrete the entire disc is in fact extremely long: tmax \u223c 1150 years if there is no mass loss due to\na wind. The huge discrepancy between this estimate and that in\nDone, Wardzinski & Gierlinski (2004) is due to differences in our\nestimates of Rdisc and Mdisc . Clearly, the outburst duration is sensitive to Rdisc and the initial surface density profile \u03a3(R): in the\n3.05\nsimple model described above, the disc mass scales as Rdisc\n. In\nthe next section, we make a more detailed estimate of the outburst\nduration by considering a more realistic surface density profile and\nestimating the fraction of the total disc mass that is available to be\naccreted onto the black hole.\n\n3 OUTBURST DURATION\nThe simple calculation described above makes two important assumptions. The first assumption is that the surface density profile\nfollows \u03a3(R) = \u03a3max at all radii at the onset of the outburst. This\n\nis not physically realistic, as the only requirement to trigger an outburst is that \u03a3(R) > \u03a3max at a single radius. The second is that\nthe entire disc mass is consumed in an outburst.\nWe begin by addressing the problem of the surface density\nprofile at the onset of an outburst. Detailed models of outburst\ncycles in X-ray transients (Dubus, Hameury & Lasota 2001) show\nthat the surface density crosses the \u03a3max threshold in the inner region of the disc. Indeed, the model presented in Figure 15\nof Dubus, Hameury & Lasota (2001) shows that \u03a3 follows \u03a3max\nclosely only in the inner 10 - 15 % of the disc and flattens off\nsomewhat at larger radii. If the surface density profile of the disc\nin GRS1915+105 follows a similar structure, we calculate the total disc mass to be much smaller than the value given in Section\n2 above. Very simply, assuming that \u03a3 = \u03a3max for 0 6 R 6\n0.1Rdisc and \u03a3 = \u03a3max (R = 0.1Rdisc ) for 0.1Rdisc 6 R 6\nRdisc , we have\nMdisc = M (R < 0.1Rdisc ) + M (R > 0.1Rdisc ).\n\n(7)\n\nIn practise, the first term is negligible, and to a very good approximation\nZ Rdisc\nMdisc =\n2\u03c0R\u03a3max (0.1Rdisc )dR,\n(8)\n0.1Rdisc\n\nor\nMdisc = 1.3 \u00d7 1028\n\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u0011\u22120.86 \u0012 M \u0013\u22120.35\nc\n1\n2\nRdisc,12\n.\n0.02\n14\n\n(9)\n\nNote that the coefficient in equation 9 is specific to this system,\nbecause it assumes a value for Rdisc that depends on the binary\nparameters. With Rdisc,12 = 2.7, \u03b1c = 0.02 and M1 = 14, this\ngives Mdisc = 9.5 \u00d7 1028 g, reducing the maximum outburst time\nto about 160 years (again assuming zero mass loss in a wind).\nHowever, this is the maximum mass of the cold disc at the\nstart of the outburst, but in an accretion disc as large as the one in\nGRS1915+105, a significant fraction of the outer parts of the disc\nmay be too cool to support an outburst at all (Hameury & Lasota\n2005). The only way that a significant fraction of such a large\ndisc can remain in the hot, ionised state is by self-irradiation.\nHeating by incident X-ray radiation produced near the accretor\n(or scattering of some small fraction of the radiation back down\nonto the disc by some form of corona) prevents the disc from\nswitching back into the cool state, so prolonging the outburst\n(Dubus, Hameury & Lasota 2001). The radius of influence of the\nincident X-rays, Rirr is usually estimated by matching the irradiation temperature to the hydrogen ionization temperature such that\n4\nTirr\n= TH4 = \u01eb\n\nLX\n\u01eb\u03b7 \u1e40 c2\n=\n2\n2\n4\u03c0\u03c3Rirr\n4\u03c0\u03c3Rirr\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the constant of proportionality \u01eb depends on the geometry of\nthe disc, the nature of the illuminating X-ray source and the X-ray\nalbedo of the gas. We will refer to \u01eb as the irradiation efficiency to\ndistinguish it from the accretion efficiency, \u03b7. This notation differs\nslightly from that used by Dubus, Hameury & Lasota (2001), who\nuse C for the irradiation efficiency. King, Kolb & Burderi (1996)\nand King (2000) have pointed out that the Eddington limit for accretion imposes a limit on Rirr , leading to the conclusion that systems with orbital periods longer than about 2 days must be transient, because at these periods Rirr can never be larger than Rdisc ,\neven for accretion beyond the Eddington limit.

Predicted maximum outburst durations for various irradiated fractions of the accretion disc. The calculation of the available disc mass is\ndescribed in Section 3 and the durations assume that all of the mass inside\nRirr is accreted during the outburst. The irradiation efficiency, \u01eb, is calculated from equation 13. Columns 4 and 5 give the predicted maximum\nduration assuming h\u1e40wind i = 0 and 2 \u00d7 1019 gs\u22121 respectively.\n\n(King & Ritter 1998; Truss & Wynn 2004), where \u1e4018 is the central accretion rate in units of 1018 gs\u22121 . For accretion at the Eddington limit, with efficiency \u03b7 = 0.1, this predicts\nREdd \u2243 1012 cm.\n\n(12)\n\nOther models - with an equally sound observational footing - predict a more efficient irradiating flux than the one\nassumed by King & Ritter (1998). Dubus et al. (1999) and\nDubus, Hameury & Lasota (2001) use a constant of proportionality that is typically about seven times larger in equation 10, which\nleads to an estimate for REdd more than twice as large. Indeed,\nthe alternative spherical inner X-ray source geometry considered\nby King & Ritter (1998) also leads to a larger estimate for REdd .\nIf we make no assumptions about the irradiation efficiency, we can\nwrite the more general expression\n\u0010 \u01eb \u00111 \u0010 \u03b7 \u00111\n1\n2\n2\n2\nRirr = 2.7 \u00d7 1011\ncm.\n(13)\n\u1e4018\n10\u22123\n0.1\nWe will return to this point in more detail in Section 4, but for\nthe time being we use equations 11 and 12 as our example, because\nthey give the smallest value of REdd and hence leads to the shortest\npossible predicted outburst duration.\nSince the mean source luminosity of GRS1915+105 is observed to be around Eddington, REdd represents the maximum\nradius of the hot, outburst region of the disc. The remainder of\nthe disc outside this point stays too cool to participate in an outburst, so the fraction of total disc mass accreted is much less than\nunity for a large disc (Shahbaz, Charles & King 1998). Adding\nthis piece of information to the more realistic estimate of the surface density profile allows us to calculate the maximum available mass of gas for the outburst. Repeating the calculation described above, but now using a maximum radius of 1012 cm gives\nMmax = 1.2\u00d71028 g. This is simply the disc mass inside 1012 cm.\nIf the mean accretion rate continues at its current value (which is\napproximately 2 \u00d7 1019 gs\u22121 ) and 100% of the mass originally\ninside R = 1012 cm is accreted, we expect the outburst to last approximately 20 years if there is no mass lost in the form of a jet or\na wind.\nHowever, there is considerable evidence for mass loss in this\nsystem via a wind. Relativistic velocities which might be appropriate for a jet mean that its mass loss rate can be small compared\nto the mass accretion rate, even if it makes a significant contribution to the energy budget (Nayakshin, Rappaport & Melia 2000).\nThe same is not true for a much slower outflow such as a wind.\nNumerical simulations by Proga & Kallman (2002) show that accretion in Galactic binary systems with high Eddington fractions\n\n3\n\ncan power a strong disc wind. These are driven by radiation pressure on the electrons as opposed to line driven as the material is\nso highly ionised it has little absorption opacity. At Eddington, the\nmass loss rate in this wind should be comparable to the mass accretion rate (Proga & Kallman 2002), and there is observational\nevidence for such high mass loss rates in GRS1915+105 from\ndetection of blueshifted, extremely ionised X-ray absorption lines\n(Lee et al. 2002). If approximately \u1e40Edd is being lost to the wind,\nthen the outburst timescales need to be halved. Table 1 shows the\npredicted maximum outburst durations for a range of irradiated disc\nfractions, with and without a significant wind mass loss rate. We interpret these two durations (no wind and an Eddington-rate wind)\nas reasonable upper and lower limit estimates for the outburst timescales for each given irradiated fraction of disc. If an Eddington\nwind loss rate is taken into account, we can see immediately that\nsince the outburst has already progressed for at least 13 years, this\nsupports the assertion made by King & Ritter (1998) that the more\nappropriate source geometry for a black hole system in outburst is\nin fact that of a central point source, leading to slightly stronger\nirradiation and a hot area of disc beyond 1012 cm. Furthermore, it\n12\nis clear that for Rirr <\ncm, the total mass of irradiated\n\u223c 1.5 \u00d7 10\ngas will be consumed in the next few years and we would expect\nthe outburst to terminate.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\nWe have shown that the total mass of the accretion disc in\nGRS1915+105 just before the onset of an outburst is of order\n\u223c 1029 g. At the current mean mass accretion rate, inferred for an\naccretion efficiency \u03b7 \u223c 0.1, this is enough to power the outburst\nfor 160 years. However, given the large scale of the disc, we surmise that a large fraction of the outer regions will remain too cool to\nsustain an outburst. Thus even the mass added to the outer edge of\nthe disc from the companion star cannot replenish the hot inner disc\nregion. Instead, it is stalled at larger radii where it does not participate in the outburst. In this scenario, equation 2 only involves the\nmass accretion rate and the wind loss rate. This is important, because the outburst time-scale is not affected by uncertainties in the\nmass transfer rate, which is extremely sensitive to the secondary\ncore mass (King et al. 1997; Ritter 1999).\nIn fact, the values in Table 1 are calculated including \u2212\u1e402 =\n10\u22128 M\u2299 yr\u22121 in equation 2, but since \u2212\u1e402 << \u1e401 , this is no\ndifferent from the case \u2212\u1e402 = 0. If \u2212\u1e402 is higher than our estimate, either due to uncertainties in the evolutionary state of the\nsystem or due to an irradiation-induced burst of mass-transfer from\nthe companion star, the outburst still cannot be prolonged because\nthe additional mass remains in the cool outer disc. We can estimate the required \u2212\u1e402 at which this assumption breaks down.\nDubus, Hameury & Lasota (2001) give an expression for the mass\ntransfer rate required to trigger a heating wave at the outer edge of\nthe disc:\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00110.2 \u0012 M \u0013\u22120.9\n1\n\u1e40 = 3.3 \u00d7 1016 \u03b4 \u22120.5\n0.02\n7\n\u0013\n\u0012\nTc\n2.6\nRdisc,11\ngs\u22121 (14)\n2000 K\nwhere \u03b4 is a parameter with typical value 0.05 \u2212 0.1. So, for\nGRS1915+105 at Rdisc,11 = 27, \u03b4 = 0.1 and Tc = 1000K,\nwe have a required mass transfer rate \u1e40 = 1.5 \u00d7 1020 gs\u22121 \u223c\n2 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . While this is below the rate required to make\nthe source persistent, it is still more than two orders of magnitude\n\n\f4\n\nM. R. Truss and C. Done\n\nlarger than would be expected from standard theories of binary evolution.\nIt is instructive to quantify the potential effect on our calculations of uncertainties in the accretion process itself and in the\nobserved parameters of GRS1915+105. Taking the simplest case\nwhere \u1e40wind = 0 and \u2212\u1e402 = 0, we see from equations 1 and 2\nthat tmax \u221d Mdisc /\u1e401 . Using equations 9 and 10, we find that\ntmax \u221d M1\u22120.35 \u03b1\u22120.86\n\u03b7\u01eb,\nc\n\n(15)\n\nallowing us to immediately identify the relative importance of uncertainties in the different parameters. It is surprising - but nevertheless a very desirable aspect of the model - that neither the luminosity nor the inferred accretion rate enter this relation at all. A\nlower accretion rate leads to a lower Rirr and a smaller available\nmass of hot gas. This means that the effect that any uncertainties in\nthe distance have on the outburst time-scale is weakened. In fact,\nin our simple model for the surface density of the disc, where the\nprofile is flat at most radii, we find in equation 9 that the mass\n\napproximately 20 years assuming no wind loss. More efficient irradiating geometries mean that more of the disc can be illuminated,\nso increasing the mass available to power the outburst and hence its\nduration.\nThe only uncertainty not present in equation 15 is the magnitude of the mass loss in a wind, and we can see immediately from\nTable 1 that there is a factor of two difference in outburst duration\nbetween the case of zero and Eddington wind losses. The observed\nwind loss rate is substantial (Lee et al. 2002), but this depends on\nthe (unknown) opening angle of the wind. Numerical simulations\nsuggest that this should be fairly large (Proga & Kallman 2002), in\nwhich case the inferred mass loss rates are comparable to the accretion rates required to sustain the outburst. In this case, the reservoir\nof available disc mass will last only half as long as expected from\naccretion alone.\n\n1\n\nscales as R2 . In this case, since Rirr \u221d LX2 , the accretion rate\ndoesn't appear in equation 15. This is very important, because observational uncertainties in the distance - here we use d = 12.5kpc\nafter Mirabel & Rodr\u00edguez (1994) but a more recent work using\nproper motions of jet components places the source about 2 kpc\ncloser (Miller-Jones et al. 2005) - do not make any difference at all\nto the predicted outburst duration.\nThe black hole mass enters equation 15 rather weakly, though\nthe observational uncertainties in this quantity are large. If the\nsystem is aligned with the jet, Harlaftis & Greiner (2004) state\nthat M1 = 14 \u00b1 4.4 M\u2299 for a jet inclination i = 66 \u00b1 2\u25e6\n(Fender et al. 1999). If the jets are misaligned with the plane of\nthe disc and are precessing, the range of possible masses widens.\nHarlaftis & Greiner (2004) consider a system inclination offset by\n10\u25e6 to the jets. At the extremes of this range, the mass could be\nanything from 11.6 \u00b1 3.3 M\u2299 to 16.9 \u00b1 5.9 M\u2299 . Over the entire\nrange of possible masses 8M\u2299 < M1 < 23M\u2299 , our predicted\noutburst duration only changes by a maximum of 21%.\nThe quiescent viscosity, \u03b1c is a much more significant uncertainty. While the origin of viscous shear is well-understood\nfor hot, ionized gases in terms of the magneto-rotational instability, our understanding of viscous processes in a cool, neutral\ngas is very limited. Therefore, an appropriate value for \u03b1c is hard\nto estimate. Our choice of \u03b1c = 0.02 is well-motivated by the\ndisc instability model and observations of quiescent intervals in\ndwarf novae, although rather different values have been suggested.\nMeyer-Hofmeister & Meyer (2001) argue that \u03b1c = 0.05 based on\na study of the quiescent intervals of shorter period X-ray transients.\nThis would decrease our predicted time scales in Table 1 by a factor\nof two. Similarly, the accretion efficiency \u03b7 could be higher than 0.1\ngiven that the black hole is spinning. A higher efficiency means that\na smaller accretion rate is required to power the same luminosity,\nand would result in a longer outburst. \u03b7 = 0.1 is appropriate for a\nblack hole spin a \u2243 0.7; at a = 0.9, \u03b7 \u2243 0.15 is more appropriate,\nleading to an outburst duration 50% longer.\nThe key parameter in determining the size of the mass reservoir to power the outburst is the irradiation efficiency, \u01eb. Of the\ndisc irradiation models considered, the smallest fraction of irradiated disc is predicted by the inner disc source geometry described\nin King & Ritter (1998). Here, even for accretion at the Eddington\nlimit, only the parts of the disc inside R = 1012 cm are illuminated by the incident X-rays. Defining this region as the only part\nof the disc capable of supporting an outburst, we calculate that its\nmass, of order \u223c 1028 g, is only sufficient to power an outburst for\n\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nWe have calculated upper and lower limits for the outburst time\nscale of GRS1915+105 for different values of the irradiation efficiency (i.e. different irradiation geometries). These limits correspond to zero and Eddington wind mass loss rates respectively. The\ntime scales in Table 1 are computed for reasonable values of black\nhole mass, disc viscosity and accretion efficiency. The sensitivity\nof our results to uncertainties in these properties are discussed in\nSection 4, in particular equation 15.\nThe crucial factor that remains to be discovered is how efficient the irradiation actually is. It is clear that the mass budget for\nGRS1915+105 already seems very tight given all the competing\nfactors. We are faced with the very interesting possibility that the\noutburst will come to an end in the next few years. If the outburst\ncontinues for substantially longer then we would have to conclude\nthat there are additional factors at work.\nThe outer disc is the only feasible additional mass source in\nthe system, and one way to tap this is via the wind. Scattering in\nthis material can enhance the illumination of the outer disc, and\nthere is observational evidence for this effect inferred from a detailed consideration of the outburst characteristics of neutron stars\nand black holes (Dubus et al. 1999). Indeed, scattering of this kind\nmay be the only way to irradiate the disc at all: many simulations\nof discs irradiated by a central source show that the disc puffs\nup and self-shields itself from the X-rays (Cannizzo, Chen & Livio\n1995; Dubus et al. 1999), in contradiction with observations showing conclusively that discs in these systems are irradiated.\nThe fraction of X-rays scattered onto the disc C \u223c \u03c4es \u03a9/2\u03c0,\nwhere \u03c4es is the electron scattering optical depth and \u03a9/2\u03c0 is the\nsolid angle subtended by the material. The wind simulations of\nProga & Kallman (2002) show \u03a9/2\u03c0 \u223c 0.3 \u2212 0.5, while the column density measured in the ionised absorber in GRS1915+105\nimplies \u03c4es \u223c 0.01 (similar optical depths are inferred for the accretion disc coronal sources) i.e. C \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 . If we assume that\nall of this X-ray flux incident on the disc goes into heating the gas,\n12\nthen C \u223c \u01eb, giving a heated disc radius >\ncm. However, if\n\u223c 2\u00d710\nonly a fraction of the incident X-rays heat the gas, we would expect\n\u01eb and Rirr to be smaller.\nThe presence of the wind can give rise to a interesting feedback. A high accretion rate can lead to a strong wind that may be\nassociated with more efficient irradiation. This will lead to a further\nincrease in the central accretion rate. However, this cannot continue\nunchecked, because too strong a wind will deplete the mass in the\n\n\fThe decline of GRS1915+105\ninner disc region, and the accretion rate will fall. We will explore\nthese ideas in a later paper.\nOur calculation can be applied to the outbursts of shorter period X-ray transients. In many ways these are far simpler, because\nwe would expect the whole disc to become irradiated and participate in the outburst. For example, taking the parameters of the black\nhole systems A0620-003 and GS2000+25, which both have orbital\nperiods around 8 hours, we find that the total mass consumed during each outburst is about 55-70% of the calculated initial total disc\nmass. This assumes \u03b7 = 0.1, zero wind mass loss and an exponential decay in central accretion rate calculated from the data given in\nChen, Shrader & Livio (1997). However, we should point out that\nwe do not expect this simple approach to work in all cases: while in\ngeneral it is true that longer period systems tend to radiate more energy (and thereby have a higher inferred accretion rate), this is not\nalways the case. For example, Aql X-1, with an orbital period of\nabout 19 hours, does not undergo rare long outbursts, but frequent\nvery short ones.\nIt is clear that there is still much to be learnt about accretion\ndisc structure and how it is affected by irradiation in X-ray transients: for example, can the disc be directly illuminated or are the\nX-rays scattered down onto the disc? How efficient is the irradiating flux? If the current outburst of GRS1915+105 goes on and\non, the conclusion that a large fraction of the disc is irradiated is\ninescapable. Since GRS1915+105 has the longest orbital period\nof any known transient (by some distance) and hence the largest\ndisc, we may be faced with the possibility that all discs in X-ray\ntransients can be fully, or almost fully, irradiated. The corollary of\nthis is that should the outburst terminate in the next few years, we\nwill have the exciting opportunity to determine the fraction of the\ndisc that was irradiated and learn much about the efficiency of the\nprocess and the importance of mass loss in a wind.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMRT acknowledges a PPARC postdoctoral fellowship and the support of a PPARC rolling grant at the University of St Andrews.\nWe are particularly grateful to the referee, whose constructive comments and insight improved the paper significantly.
