INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of Eddington's famous discoveries is that the isotropic distribution function (DF) of a spherical stellar system can be\ncalculated from the density using an Abel transform pair (Eddington 1916; Binney & Tremaine 1987, p. 237):\n!\nZ E 2\n1\nd \u03c1 d\u03c8\n1 d\u03c1\nf (E) = \u221a\n.\n(1)\n+\n\u221a\n\u221a\n8\u03c02 0 d\u03c82 E \u2212 \u03c8\nE d\u03c8 \u03c8=0\nHere, E = \u03c8 \u2212 v2 /2 is the binding energy per unit mass, and \u03c8 is the relative potential.\nHowever, galaxy halos produced in cosmological simulations are held up by anisotropic velocity dispersions (see e.g.,\nHansen & Moore 2006). The recovery of an anisotropic DF for a spherical system is a more difficult problem (Hunter & Qian\n1993). Now, the steady state DF can depend not only on E but also on the magnitude of the specific angular momentum L = rvT\nthrough Jeans' theorem. Here vT is the two-dimensional velocity component projected on the tangential plane.\nAt least in the comparison of observational data with models (e.g., van der Marel et al. 2000; Wilkinson et al. 2004;\nTreu & Koopmans 2004), a widely used Ansatz for the form of DF is\nf (E, L) = L\u22122\u03b2 fE (E),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere fE (E) is a function of the binding energy alone. It is easy to show that the models generated by this DF exhibit the property\nthat\nhv2 i\n(3)\n\u03b2 = 1 \u2212 T2 .\n2hvr i\n\nHere, hv2r i and hv2T i are the radial and the tangential velocity second moments. The general inversion formula for the unknown\nfunction fE (E) (Cuddeford 1991; Kochanek 1996; Wilkinson & Evans 1999, see also Appendix A) is no more difficult than\nEddington's formula (eq. 1).\nWe note that it is common practice to characterize the velocity anisotropy of a spherically symmetric stellar system by the\nparameter \u03b2 defined in equation (3), which is sometimes referred to as the anisotropy parameter (Binney & Tremaine 1987).\nIf 0 < \u03b2 \u2264 1, the velocity dispersion ellipsoid is a prolate spheroid with the major axis along the radial direction (radially\nanisotropic), while it is an oblate spheroid with the tangential plane being the plane of symmetry (tangentially anisotropic) if\n\u03b2 < 0. In particular, \u03b2 = 1 and \u03b2 = \u2212\u221e indicate that every star is in a radial or circular orbit, respectively. On the other hand,\nsystems with isotropic velocity dispersions have \u03b2 = 0. In general, the anisotropy parameter varies radially, but for the system\nwith a DF of the form of equation (2), it is constant everywhere.\nDespite the attractiveness of a simple inversion of the DF in equation (2), the assumption of uniform anisotropy is not always\ndesirable. For example, it is useful to be able to build models that are isotropic in the center and radially anisotropic in the outer\nparts, as seems to be the case for dark matter halos (Hansen & Moore 2006). DFs that are tangentially anisotropic in the outer\nparts are helpful for understanding the substructure and the satellite galaxy populations in dark matter halos.\nIn this paper we study algorithms for building galaxies with varying anisotropy, using sums of DFs of the form of equation(2).\n\u00a7 2 introduces a new family of cusped halo models, the generalized isochrones, and \u00a7 3 examines the generalized Plummer\nmodels. Every member of the family has analytic potential-density pairs, velocity dispersions, and DFs. Specific examples\nare provided with the cosmologically important r\u22121 , r\u22123/2 , and r\u22124/3 density cusps. \u00a7 4 discusses a specific application of our\n1 Current Address: MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics & Space Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge,\nMA 02139, USA\n\n\f2\n\nJ.

The classical isochrone (p = 2) is cored, whereas all other models are cusped with \u03c1 \u223c r \u2212(p\u22122) at\nsmall radii. The small arrows indicate the half-mass radius.\n\ntheoretical models to the problem of estimating the mass of a host galaxy from the motion of its satellites. Finally, \u00a7 5 concludes\nwith a brief comparison between our methods of producing varying-anisotropy DFs and other suggestions in the literature (e.g.,\nOsipkov 1979; Merritt 1985; Cuddeford 1991; Gerhard 1991).\n2. THE GENERALIZED ISOCHRONE SPHERES\n\nThe isochrone sphere has the\nEvans, de Zeeuw, & Lynden-Bell 1990)\n\npotential-density\n\u03c8=\n\nGM\n;\nb+s\n\npair\n\u03c1=\n\n(H\u00e9non\n\n1959;\n\nM (2s + b)b\n,\n4\u03c0 s3 (b + s)2\n\nEggen, Lynden-Bell, & Sandage\n\n1962;\n(4)\n\n\u221a\nwhere M is the total mass of the system, s = b2 + r2 , and b is a constant defining the scale length. Like the Plummer (1911)\nmodel, the density is finite and well behaved at the center. Unlike the Plummer model, the density falls off as r\u22124 at large radii,\nwhich is a better fit to elliptical galaxies than the r\u22125 fall-off of the Plummer model. There are many available studies regarding\nits DFs (e.g., Gerhard 1991; Bertin et al. 1997), some of which are essentially numerical in nature.\nInspired by this, let us consider the potential-density pair\nGM\nM 2br p + b p (1 + p)(b + s)\n\u03c8=\n;\n\u03c1=\n,\n(5)\nb+s\n4\u03c0\nr2\u2212p s2p\u22121 (b + s)3\nwhere\ns = (b p + r p )1/p .\n(6)\nHere, p > 0 is a new parameter used for the generalization of the isochrone sphere (eq. 4). The condition that the density\ndecreases monotonically with increasing radius restricts p \u2264 2, with the limit (p = 2) being the cored classical isochrone sphere.\nIn fact, all the halo models with 0 < p < 2 are cusped. In particular, the density behaves as \u03c1 \u223c r\u2212(2\u2212p) as r \u2192 0. On the other\nhand, we find that \u03c1 \u223c r\u2212q where q = min(4, p + 3) as r \u2192 \u221e. The density profiles of some members of this family are shown in\nFigure 1. We note that the case p = 1, for which \u03c8 = GM/(2b + r), is actually recognized as the Hernquist (1990) model, albeit\nwith a slightly unusual identification for the scale length (a = 2b). Models with p = 1/2 and p = 2/3 possess the cosmological\ncusps suggested by Moore et al. (1998) and Evans & Collett (1997).\nThe enclosed mass and the circular speed are found to be\n\uf8f9\u22122\n!1/p\u22121 \uf8ee\n!\np 1/p\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\nr2 d\u03c8\nbp\nGMr p\nb\nGMr\nb\n2\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb ;\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0 1 +\n.\n(7)\nMr = \u2212\n= M 1+ p\n=\n+\nv\n=\nc\nG dr\nr\nrp\nr\nr\ns p\u22121 (b + s)2\nThe potential \u03c8(r) of the generalized isochrone sphere is simple enough that the inverse, r(\u03c8), can be easily found (with G = M =\nb = 1 without any loss of generality):\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(1 \u2212 \u03c8) p \u2212 \u03c8 p 1/p\nr(\u03c8) =\n.\n(8)\n\u03c8\nUsing this, in principle, one can construct infinitely many different expressions for \u03c1(\u03c8, r), each of which can be inverted to yield\nthe DF by means of integral transforms (Lynden-Bell 1962). However, for most cases this procedure is analytically intractable.\nRather, it is often more productive to look for a specific form of \u03c1(\u03c8, r) that is associated with a plausible Ansatz for the DF,\nwhose inversion reduces to elementary integrals.\n\n\fG\uf761\uf76c\uf761\uf778\uf779 M\uf76f\uf764\uf765\uf76c\uf773 \uf777\uf769\uf774\uf768 T\uf761\uf76e\uf767\uf765\uf76e\uf774\uf769\uf761\uf76c\uf76c\uf779 A\uf76e\uf769\uf773\uf76f\uf774\uf772\uf76f\uf770\uf769\uf763 V\uf765\uf76c\uf76f\uf763\uf769\uf774\uf779 D\uf769\uf773\uf774\uf772\uf769\uf762\uf775\uf774\uf769\uf76f\uf76e\uf773\n\n3\n\n2.1. Two Component Distribution Functions\nOne such possible (r,\u03c8)-split with an analytically tractable inversion is given by\n1 2p\u22122 2p+2\np + 1 p\u22122 2p+1\nr \u03c8\n(1 \u2212 \u03c8)1\u22122p +\nr\n\u03c8\n(1 \u2212 \u03c8)1\u22122p .\n(9)\n4\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nWe note that a DF of the form of equation (2) can be inverted from an (r,\u03c8)-split that is a monomial of r, with its power index\nlinearly related to \u03b2. By having the (r,\u03c8)-split given by a linear combination of two monomials of r, the inversion of equation\n(9) can be achieved by simply extending the known procedure, while the system is no longer restricted to have uniform velocity\nanisotropy. Inspired by this, let us suppose that the DF is of the form\n\u03c1=\n\nf (E, L) = L p\u22122 f1 (E) + L2p\u22122 f2 (E),\nwhere f1 (E) and f2 (E) are functions of E to be determined. Then, the density is found to be\nZ\nZ\n2 p+1/2 \u03c03/2 \u0393(p) \u03c8\n2 p/2+1/2 \u03c03/2 \u0393(p/2) \u03c8\ndE (\u03c8 \u2212 E) p/2\u22121/2 f1 (E) + r2p\u22122\ndE (\u03c8 \u2212 E) p\u22121/2 f2 (E),\n\u03c1 = r p\u22122\n\u0393(p/2 + 1/2)\n\u0393(p + 1/2)\n0\n0\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u0393(x) is the gamma function. By comparing this to equation (9), a possible DF may be found by inverting the integral\nequations\nZ \u03c8\n(p + 1)\u0393(p/2 + 1/2) 2p+1\ndE (\u03c8 \u2212 E) p/2\u22121/2 f1 (E) = p/2+5/2 5/2\n\u03c8\n(1 \u2212 \u03c8)1\u22122p ;\n2\n\u03c0\n\u0393(p/2)\n0\nZ \u03c8\n\u0393(p + 1/2)\n\u03c82p+2 (1 \u2212 \u03c8)1\u22122p .\n(12)\ndE (\u03c8 \u2212 E) p\u22121/2 f2 (E) = p+3/2 5/2\n2\n\u03c0\n\u0393(p)\n0\nThe inversion procedure is essentially identical to the one that leads to equations (A2) and (A3). After this inversion, we find that\nf1 (E) and f2 (E) are\n!\n\u0393(2p + 3)\n3p + 3\n(3p+1)/2\nf1 (E) = p/2+7/2 5/2\n;E ;\nE\n2 F 1 2p \u2212 1, 2p + 2;\n2\n2\n\u03c0 \u0393(p/2)\u0393(3p/2 + 3/2)\n!\n5\n\u0393(2p + 3)\n(13)\nf2 (E) = p+3/2 5/2\nE p+3/2 2 F1 2p \u2212 1, 2p + 3; p + ; E ,\n2\n2\n\u03c0 \u0393(p)\u0393(p + 5/2)\nboth of which are always nonnegative for all accessible E-values (0 \u2264 E \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 1/2). While we have given the result in complete\ngenerality in terms of hypergeometric functions 2 F1 (a, b; c; x), the DFs reduce to entirely elementary and analytic functions if\np = 1/2, 1, or 2. In fact, if p = 1/2, both hypergeometric functions are just unity, whereas if p is an integer, both reduce to\nelementary functions. If p is a half integer other than 1/2, only f2 reduces to an elementary function.\nOf particular interest is the case in which p = 1/2, for which the model possesses a central cusp like \u03c1 \u223c r\u22123/2 , as found by\ncosmological simulations (Moore et al. 1998).

From top to bottom, the parameter p varies\nfrom 1/4 to 2 with increments of 1/4. Note that the last curve, p = 2, corresponds to the classical cored isochrone sphere.\n\nwhere\n\n!\n\u03c8\n.\nVi = (1 \u2212 \u03c8) 2 F1 (3 + i, 1; 2p + 2 + i; \u03c8) = 2 F1 2p \u2212 1, 1; 2p + 2 + i; \u2212\n1\u2212\u03c8\n\n(19)\n\n\"\n#\np (2p + 3)V1 + 8r p \u03c8V2\n\u03b2=1\u2212\n2 (2p + 3)V1 + 4r p \u03c8V2\n\n(20)\n\nThe anisotropy parameter\n\nis now no longer constant. Figure 2 shows the behavior of \u03b2 for some of these models. The curves can be understood on\nexamination of equation (20). This reveals that whereas \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 (p/2) at r = 0 for any p, limr\u2192\u221e \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 p if p > 1, or\nlimr\u2192\u221e \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 (p/2) if p < 1. At the critical value p = 1, we find that the anisotropy parameter monotonically decreases from\n\u03b2 = 1/2 at r = 0 to \u03b2 \u2192 5/18 as r \u2192 \u221e. Hence, the DFs discussed in this section build the generalized isochrone spheres with\neither decreasing \u03b2 in the inner region and increasing \u03b2 in the outer region (p < 1), or decreasing \u03b2 throughout (p \u2265 1). The\nparticular case of the latter also includes the Hernquist model (p = 1) and the classical isochrone sphere (p = 2).\nThe simplest case is again p = 1/2, which leads to\nhv2r i =\n\n2 + 3r1/2 + r\n4\u03c11 + 3\u03c12 \u03c8\n=\n\u03c8;\n\u03c11 + \u03c12 12 6 + 10r1/2 + 3r\n\nhv2T i =\n\n2 + 4r1/2 + r \u03c8\n2\u03c11 + 3\u03c12 \u03c8\n=\n.\n\u03c11 + \u03c12 12 6 + 10r1/2 + 3r 2\n\n(21)\n\nThen we find that the virial theorem holds locally for this case:\nhv2r i + hv2T i =\n\n6\u03c11 + 6\u03c12 \u03c8\n\u03c8\n= ,\n\u03c11 + \u03c12 12 2\n\n(22)\n\nand the anisotropy parameter\n\u03b2=\n\n1 6 + 8r1/2 + 3r 3(r \u2212 2)2 \u2212 r1/2 (r + 2)\n=\n4 2 + 3r1/2 + r\n4(r \u2212 4)(r \u2212 1)\n\n(23)\n\n\u221a\nvaries from \u03b2 = 3/4 at r = 0, to \u03b2 = 1/ 2 at r = 2, and back to \u03b2 \u2192 3/4 as r \u2192 \u221e. This model in fact corresponds to one of the\n1/2 2 \u22121\n1/2\n\u22121\ngeneralized hypervirial\n\u221a models studied by An & Evans (2005a). That is, \u03c8 = [1 + (1 + r ) ] = (2 + 2r + r) so that r0 = 2b\nand (p, c) = (1, 1/ 2) in their parameters.\nWe note that both V1 and V2 in fact reduce to the incomplete Beta functions, which may be useful for the purpose of numerical\ncalculations. Furthermore, if 4p is an integer, both V1 and V2 reduce to elementary functions of \u03c8, and so do the velocity second\nmoments.

GENERALIZED PLUMMER MODELS\n\nNext, let us consider the one-parameter family of potential-density pairs,\n\u03c8=\n\nGM\n;\np\n(a + r p )1/p\n\n\u03c1=\n\nap\n(p + 1)M\n,\n4\u03c0\nr2\u2212p (a p + r p )2+1/p\n\n(26)\n\nwhich was originally introduced by Veltmann (1979). This includes the Hernquist (1990) model (p = 1) and the Plummer (1911)\nmodel (p = 2) as particular cases. Evans & An (2005) recently found that this family can be constructed from power-law DFs of\nthe form of f (E, L) \u221d L p\u22122 E (3p+1)/2 . Here we construct slightly more complicated DFs that build this family of models. We first\nfind every DF of the form of equation (2), and then use them to build models with a more general variation of anisotropy.\n3.1. Distribution Functions with Constant Anisotropy Parameter\nWith G = M = a = 1, we find that\np + 1 p+3\u22122\u03b2\n\u03c8\n(1 \u2212 \u03c8 p )1\u22122(1\u2212\u03b2)/p ,\nr2\u03b2 \u03c1 =\n4\u03c0\nand that\ndm \u0010 2\u03b2 \u0011\nr \u03c1\n=0\nd\u03c8m\n\u03c8=0\nfor m < p + 3 \u2212 2\u03b2. Then, equation (A2) reduces to\n1 dn+1\n2\u03b2\u22121\np+1\nf (E, L) =\n(2\u03c0)5/2 \u0393(n \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 1/2)\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2) L2\u03b2 dE n+1\n\nZ\n\nE\n0\n\nd\u03c8\n\u03c8 p+3\u22122\u03b2\n,\n(1 \u2212 \u03c8 p )\u03bb (E \u2212 \u03c8)3/2\u2212\u03b2\u2212n\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\nwhere n = \u230a3/2 \u2212 \u03b2\u230b is the integer floor of 3/2 \u2212 \u03b2, and \u03bb + 1 = 2(1 \u2212 \u03b2)/p. If \u03bb \u2265 0, it is at least formally possible to derive the\nseries expression of the DF for arbitrary p and \u03b2 from the integral form, namely,\nf (E, L) =\n\n\u221e\n2\u03b2\u22121 p + 1 E p+3/2\u2212\u03b2 X \u0393(pk + p + 4 \u2212 2\u03b2) \u0393(k + \u03bb) E pk\n,\n\u0393(pk + p + 5/2 \u2212 \u03b2) \u0393(\u03bb) k!\n(2\u03c0)5/2 \u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2) L2\u03b2\nk=0\n\n(30)\n\nwhich becomes the generalized hypergeometric series if p is a rational number. On the other hand, if \u22121 < \u03bb < 0, we find\nthat limE\u21921\u2212 f (E, L) < 0 so that the corresponding DF is unphysical. Hence, for the potential-density pair of equation (26), the\nconstant anisotropy DF is physical only if p \u2264 2(1 \u2212 \u03b2). This means that the hypervirial models of Evans & An (2005), which\nhave an anisotropy parameter \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 (p/2), have the maximally radially biased velocity dispersions for a given p and a constant\n\u03b2. Although there exist models with \u03b2 locally exceeding 1 \u2212 (p/2) for the generalized Plummer sphere of given p (see e.g.,\nBaes & Dejonghe 2002), \u03b2 at the center cannot be greater than 1 \u2212 (p/2) for physically valid DFs. This is in agreement with the\ncusp slope\u2013central anisotropy theorem derived by An & Evans (2005b).\nThe corresponding velocity dispersions can be found either from equation (A8) or by solving Jeans equation. The results can be\ngenerally expressed using the incomplete Beta functions. The equivalent results expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions\nare also found in equation (9) of Evans & An (2005).\nFor particular values of p or \u03b2, the DF of equation (29) (or equivalently, eq. 30) reduces to a simpler form. For example, if\n\u03b2 = 1/2, the DF is (see eq. A3)\n\u0003\n\u0002\nE p+1\np+1\n(31)\n(p + 2) \u2212 (2p + 1)E p ,\nf (E, L) =\n3\np\n1/p\n(2\u03c0) L (1 \u2212 E )\nwhere the positive definiteness of the DF implies that 0 < p \u2264 1. Similarly, for \u03b2 = \u22121/2, the DF is\nf (E, L) =\n\ni\nh\nE p+2\n(p + 1)L\n(p + 3)(p + 4) \u2212 (5p2 + 12p + 3)E p + 2p(2p + 1)E 2p ,\n3\np\n1+3/p\n(2\u03c0) (1 \u2212 E )\n\n(32)\n\nwhich is nonnegative for 0 \u2264 E \u2264 1 if 0 < p \u2264 3. On the other hand, the DF of the Hernquist model with constant \u03b2 reduces to\nthe hypergeometric function (see e.g., Baes & Dejonghe 2002)\n!\nE 5/2\u2212\u03b2\n2\u03b2 \u0393(5 \u2212 2\u03b2)\n7\nf (E, L) =\n1\n\u2212\n2\u03b2,\n5\n\u2212\n2\u03b2;\nF\n\u2212\n\u03b2;\nE\n,\n(33)\n2 1\n2\n(2\u03c0)5/2\u0393(7/2 \u2212 \u03b2)\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2) L2\u03b2\nwhich is nonnegative everywhere if \u03b2 \u2264 1/2, whereas that for the constant-\u03b2 Plummer model reduces to\nf (E, L) =\nwhich is physical if \u03b2 \u2264 0.\n\n!\nE 7/2\u2212\u03b2\n3 * 2\u03b2\u22121 \u0393(6 \u2212 2\u03b2)\n9 \u2212 2\u03b2 11 \u2212 2\u03b2 2\n7\nF\n\u2212\n\u03b2;\n,\n;\nE\n\u2212\u03b2,\n3\n\u2212\n\u03b2,\n,\n3 2\n2\n4\n4\n(2\u03c0)5/2\u0393(9/2 \u2212 \u03b2)\u0393(1 \u2212 \u03b2) L2\u03b2\n\n(34)\n\n\f6\n\nJ.

Distribution Functions with Outwardly Decreasing Anisotropy Parameter\nSince equation (27) is valid for any constant \u03b2 with common \u03c1, it is, in general, also possible to express the density profile of\nthe generalized Plummer model by\nX\np + 1 X \u22122\u03b2i p+3\u22122\u03b2i\n\u03bci r \u03c8\n(1 \u2212 \u03c8 p )1\u22122(1\u2212\u03b2i )/p ;\n\u03bci = 1,\n(35)\n\u03c1=\n4\u03c0 i\ni\nwhere the parameters \u03bci > 0 are normalized weights.

All the models have the same half-mass radius and reproduce the same mean kinetic\nenergy hT rr i of the satellite population of the Milky Way. The inferred mass of the Milky Way (in units of 1012 M\u2299 ) is plotted against the parameter p, which\ncontrols the velocity anisotropy.\n\n4. AN APPLICATION: THE MASS OF THE MILKY WAY\n\nAs an application of the preceding theory, let us consider the problem of estimating the mass of the Milky Way from the radial\nvelocities of its satellites. There are 27 distant globular clusters and dwarf galaxies at Galactocentric distance r greater than 20\nkpc (see e.g., tables 2 and 3 of Wilkinson & Evans 1999). These range from Arp 2 at r = 20 kpc out to Leo I at r = 254 kpc. The\nmedian distance of the satellite population is rmed \u2248 38 kpc. The number density of the satellites falls off roughly like r\u22123.5 . This\ndataset is often used to estimate the mass of the Milky Way (Kochanek 1996; Wilkinson & Evans 1999), as the H I rotation curve\ncannot be traced beyond \u223c20 kpc. The satellites are therefore the only available probe of the gravitational field of the distant halo.\nAll the satellites have accurate radial velocities, but proper motions are available only for a handful of the closest objects.\nOf course, the heliocentric radial velocity and the Galactocentric radial velocity are basically the same (once the motion of the\nSun has been taken out), as the Galactocentric distance of the Sun is much smaller than those of the satellites. The kinematic\ndata therefore constrains the mean kinetic energy in the radial direction T rr = hv2r i. Again using the data in tables 2 and 3 of\nWilkinson & Evans (1999), we find that T rr \u2248 (129 km s\u22121 )2 .\nTo model the Milky Way halo, we assume that its potential and density take the form of either the generalized isochrone\nor the generalized Plummer models. Furthermore, we assume that the number density of satellites shadows the total density\n(e.g., Kochanek 1996; Wilkinson & Evans 1999). This means that the satellites are drawn from DFs of the form given by either\nequation (10) or equation (42). We set the scale length so that the half-mass radius of the assumed density profile corresponds to\nthe observed median radius of the population. The mass of the Milky Way M enters into the potential and the DF. It can therefore\nbe constrained by requiring that the mean kinetic energy in the radial direction be consistent with the data, viz,\nR\n\u03c1hv2r i d3r\n\u2248 16, 640 km2 s\u22122 .\n(43)\nT rr = R\n\u03c1 d3r\n\nThe parameter p in the DFs controls the variation of the velocity anisotropy with radius. Hence, equation (43) defines a line in\nthe plane (M, p), which is the mass-anisotropy degeneracy curve for the model. Figure 4, inferred from numerical integrations,\nshows such curves computed for a number of the generalized isochrones and the generalized Plummer models.\nIn this problem, the mean kinetic energy in the radial direction is fixed. Models with tangential anisotropy at large radii therefore\nlead to a higher inferred mass for the Milky Way galaxy. The relative location of the curves in Figure 4 can be understood by\nexamining the behavior of the anisotropy parameter for the models. More importantly, as the velocity anisotropy changes, the\ninferred mass of the Milky Way ranges from 0.8 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 to 2.5 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 . Now, the velocity anisotropy of the satellite galaxy\npopulation is unknown, so the mass-anisotropy degeneracy by itself enforces a factor of \u223c3 uncertainty in the mass of the Milky\nWay. This fundamental limitation can only be overcome by proper-motion data.\nOf course, there are other uncertainties; for example, the half-mass radius of the satellite population used to set the scale\nlength in these calculations is also not well known (note that the locations of the satellites are likely to be biased toward their\napogalacticon) and has an uncertainty of \u223c20%. This carries over into an additional \u223c20% uncertainty in the inferred mass. This\nis small in comparison with the mass-anisotropy degeneracy, but not insignificantly so.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis paper provides a number of flexible and simple galaxy models extended from two classical cored profiles: the isochrone\nsphere and Plummer model. We also derive analytic distribution functions (DFs) with varying velocity anisotropy for all the\n\n\f8\n\nJ. A\uf76e & N. W. E\uf776\uf761\uf76e\uf773\n\nmodels including new DFs for the classical isochrone sphere and the Hernquist model.\nDFs of the form f (E, L) = L\u22122\u03b2 fE (E) build a spherical system with a constant anisotropy parameter \u03b2, where E is the binding\nenergy and L is the specific angular momentum. The assumption of constant anisotropy is not enough to provide realistic models,\nas both observational data and numerical simulations suggest that dark halos and their constituents (such as satellites) have\nvelocity anisotropies that vary with radius (e.g., White 1985; van der Marel 1994; Hansen & Moore 2006).\nHere we have explored models whose DFs are superpositions of two or more such terms, namely,\nX\nf (E, L) =\nL\u22122\u03b2i fi (E).\n(44)\ni\n\nThis can be done in two ways. First, as illustrated by the generalized isochrones in \u00a7 2, we can sometimes find a splitting of the\ndensity in the form\nX\n\u03c1(r) =\nr\u22122\u03b2i gi (\u03c8(r)).\n(45)\ni\n\nand apply the inversion separately to each component. For the generalized isochrones, this provides models with either decreasing\nanisotropy parameter \u03b2 in the inner region and increasing \u03b2 in the outer parts, or decreasing \u03b2 throughout. Second, as illustrated\nby the generalized Plummer models in \u00a7 3, we can always add together weighted sums of constant anisotropy DFs, each of\nwhich individually reproduces the required density. This appears to provide models with decreasing anisotropy parameter \u03b2\nthroughout. At large radii, the DF is dominated by the component of smallest \u03b2, and the models can be either radially or\ntangentially anisotropic in the outer parts, according to choice. For both cases, it appears that the anisotropy parameter always\ndecreases on beginning to move outward from the very center.\nThere have been a number of previous algorithms suggested for building anisotropic DFs with varying anisotropy. For example,\nthe Osipkov-Merritt algorithm (Osipkov 1979; Merritt 1985) builds models that are isotropic in the inner parts and tend to extreme\nradial anisotropy (\u03b2 \u2192 1) in the outer parts. Gerhard (1991) provided a clever algorithm for building separable DFs of the form\nf = g(E)h(L/Lc(E)),\n\n(46)\n\nwhere Lc is the angular momentum of a circular orbit with energy E. The analytic examples provided by Gerhard (1991) all have\nincreasing radial anisotropy in the outer parts. His method can be used to generate tangentially anisotropic models, but usually at\nthe cost of a numerical inversion. The methods developed in this paper therefore provide a complement to the existing inversions.\nTangential anisotropy often arises in accreted populations, such as satellite galaxies. As an application of our models, we have\nshown that the mass-anisotropy degeneracy by itself provides a factor \u223c3 uncertainty in the mass of the Milky Way galaxy as\ndeduced from the kinematics of its satellites.\nThe density profiles of models studied in this paper typically fall off faster than \u03c1 \u223c r\u22123 and slower than \u03c1 \u223c r\u22125 at large radii,\nwhich are in good agreement with both observations of spheroidal components of galaxies and results from numerical simulations.\nAt small radii, they are typically cusped, with cusp indices in the range suggested by numerical simulations. In particular, there\nare members with density cusps like \u03c1 \u223c r\u22121 , \u223c r\u22124/3 , and \u223c r\u22123/2 , which have been suggested as important on cosmogonic\ngrounds (Navarro, Frenk, & White 1995; Evans & Collett 1997; Moore et al. 1998), although observational evidence seems to\nfavor the presence of a constant-density core (Tyson, Kochanski, & dell'Antonio 1998; Palunas & Williams 2000; de Blok et al.\n2001; Kleyna et al. 2003; Donato, Gentile, & Salucci 2004). However, even if real galaxies are cored, the core would be such a\nsmall fraction of the halo that it is not practically important for studies of the whole. Our families of new models therefore should\nfind widespread application in the modeling of galaxies and dark halos.\nWe thank C. Hunter, who made a number of interesting comments on the various incarnations of this paper.\nREFERENCES\nAn, J., & Evans, N. W. 2005a, A&A, 444, 45 (astro-ph/0508419)\nAn, J. H., & Evans, N.

On differentiating equation (A6) with respect to \u03c8 and noting that the right-hand side\nis the same as equation (A1), that is, \u2202(\u03c1hv2r i)/\u2202\u03c8 = \u03c1, it follows that\nZ\nZ \u03c8\nZ r\n1 \u03c8 \u2032\n1\n1\nd\u03c8\u2032\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nhvr i =\n(A8)\nd\u03c8 \u03c1(r, \u03c8 ) =\nd\u03c8 h(\u03c8 ) = 2\u03b2\ndr\u2032 \u2032 r\u2032 2\u03b2 \u03c1.\n\u03c1 0\nh(\u03c8) 0\ndr\nr \u03c1 \u221e\n\nWe note that equation (A8) can also be derived from the integral solution of Jeans' equation with a constant \u03b2 (see eq. 9 of\nEvans & An 2005). This also indicates that equation (A8) is actually a general result for a constant \u03b2 model, regardless of the\nspecific form of the DF that generates the model.\nAs an example, let us think of the DFs that build the generalized isochrone sphere with a constant anisotropy parameter. First,\nthe DF and the DED for the generalized isochrone sphere with \u03b2 = 1/2 can be found from equation (A3);\nE 2 g(E)\ndM [(1 \u2212 E) p \u2212 E p ]1/p\n1\ng(E)\n(A9)\n;\n=\ndE\n(2\u03c0)3 L (1 \u2212 E)2p [(1 \u2212 E) p \u2212 E p ]1/p\n2(1 \u2212 E)2p\nh\ni\nh\ni\ng(E) = E 2p\u22121 6(p + 1)E \u2212 6E 2 \u2212 (p + 1)(2p + 1) + (1 \u2212 E) p E p\u22121 (p + 1)(p + 2) + 12E 2 \u2212 6(p + 2)E + 6(1 \u2212 E)2p+1 .

A2) is also analytically tractable if \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 (p/2). That is, for the density profile of the generalized isochrone\nsphere, we find that\ni\n1 p+2\n1 d h 2p+2\nr2\u2212p \u03c1 =\n\u03c8\n(1 \u2212 \u03c8)2\u22122p .\n(A11)\n\u03c8 (1 \u2212 \u03c8)1\u2212p +\n2\u03c0\n8\u03c0 d\u03c8\n\n\f10\n\nJ.

We believe that this is because the behavior of dM/dE near E = 0 is dominated by the stars at large\nradii and the r\u22124 fall-off marks a critical point (Evans & An 2006).\n\n\f"}
