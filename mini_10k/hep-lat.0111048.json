As\nin any numerical method, the coexistence of widely separated energy scales poses severe\npractical problems: for instance, the energy-momentum resolution a\u22121 , which is induced\nby the lattice regularization, should be kept much larger than both the typical hadron\nmass scale, say \u223c 500 MeV, and the external momenta of the correlation functions that\nare computed. Moreover, the approximate and spontaneously broken flavour chiral\nsymmetry that is exhibited by the strong interactions entails the need of performing at\nleast a few simulations of lattice QCD in large volume and with small quark masses3 :\na fully realistic setup would require a lattice of spatial volume L3 , with M\u03c0 L \u2265 5 and\nM\u03c0 \u223c 140 MeV.\nThe relevance of the approximate chiral symmetry for the low energy QCD amplitudes can hardly be overestimated: it determines many aspects of the dynamics, as\nshown by the chiral effective Lagrangian approach, and strongly constrains the operator mixings, which on the lattice may be particularly severe due to the dimensionful\nultraviolet cutoff a\u22121 . The realization of the chiral symmetry on the lattice is known\nto be delicate since the pioneering work by Wilson [1] and in most cases the full flavour\nchiral symmetry is recovered only in the continuum limit. The highly remarkable exception is represented by those lattice formulations where the Dirac operator satisfies\nthe Ginsparg-Wilson relation [2], which in turn entails an exact flavour chiral invariance at finite lattice spacing. The lattice regularizations with Ginsparg-Wilson quarks\ncertainly simplify a lot the construction of renormalized operators, especially those relevant for the weak effective Hamiltonian, at the price however of a big overhead in the\ncomputational effort. In many cases one can avoid such an overhead by working within\nthe framework of Wilson quarks, which seems to be more flexible and powerful than\nbelieved till few years ago, as we try to argue in the following. In general, the lattice\nregularization of the quark sector should be chosen with care depending on the physical\napplications and the related renormalization problems.\nIn this contribution we focus on a lattice formulation of QCD, based on Wilson\nquarks and known as twisted mass QCD (tmQCD), that is particularly suited for dealing\nwith the u and d quarks. After discussing in Section 2 how the simulations of lattice\nQCD account for the contribution of quark zero modes, we illustrate in Section 3 the\nbasic features of lattice tmQCD. In Section 4 we briefly report on an exploratory nonperturbative study of O(a) improved lattice tmQCD, which reaches a pseudoscalar to\nvector meson mass ratio of MPS /MV \u2243 0.47(1) and represents a successful test of several\naspects of our approach.\n3\n\nThis task is significantly alleviated by studying the renormalization problems in finite volume by\nmeans of renormalization group and finite-size scaling techniques, e.g. in the Schr\u00f6dinger functional\nscheme.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLattice QCD and physical quark zero modes\n\nWe assume that the reader is familiar with the lattice regularization of QCD introduced\nby Wilson [1] and for simplicity we consider the theory with two mass-degenerate quark\nflavours. In this case the lattice action with Wilson quarks reads\nX\n\u0002\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u03c7(x) 12 \u03b3 * (\u2207 + \u2207\u2217 ) \u2212 a 12 \u2207\u2217 * \u2207 + m\u20320 \u03c7 (x) ,\n(2.1)\nS = Sg [U ; g02 ] + a4\nx\n\nwhere Sg is the pure gauge action, \u03c7 denotes the doublet of quark fields and v*w \u2261 v\u03bc w\u03bc ,\nwhile \u2207\u03bc = \u2207\u03bc [U ] and \u2207\u2217\u03bc = \u2207\u2217\u03bc [U ] stand for the forward and backward covariant\nderivatives on the lattice. The hard breaking of the flavour non-singlet axial generators\ninduced by the Wilson term can be compensated up to O(a) effects by tuning the\nparameter m\u20320 and the coefficients that parameterize any chirality-violating operator\nmixings [3]. The leading cutoff effects can be removed via the on-shell O(a) improvement\n[4] \u00e0 la Symanzik.\n2.1\n\nValence and sea quarks\n\nIn any correlation function to be evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations, due to the\nhuge dimensionality of the vector space spanned by the Grassmann variables in the\nEuclidean path integral, it is customary to integrate out analytically the fermionic\ndegrees of freedom. In the case of the correlator of two local pseudoscalar densities with\nisospin index a = 1,\nZ\n1\n1\n11\nCPS\n(x \u2212 y) \u2261 \u2212hP 1 (x)P 1 (y)i = \u2212Z \u22121 dU d\u03c7d\u03c7 exp(\u2212S) [\u03c7\u03b35 \u03c42 \u03c7](x)[\u03c7\u03b35 \u03c42 \u03c7](y) ,\n(2.2)\n\nthis procedure yields\n11\nCPS\n(x\n\n\u2212 y) =\n*\n\nZ\n\ndU P [U ; g02 , m\u2032q ] *\nn\no\n1\n1\ntr [DW,c + m\u2032q ]\u22121 (x, y)\u03b35 \u03c42 [DW,c + m\u2032q ]\u22121 (y, x)\u03b35 \u03c42 ,\n\nP [U ; g02 , m\u2032q ] = Z \u22121 exp(\u2212Sg [U, g02 ]) det({DW,c + m\u2032q }[U ]) \u2265 0 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere4 Z denotes the Euclidean partition function and DW,c = DW,c [U ] is the critical\n(two-flavour) Wilson-Dirac operator:\nDW,c = 21 \u03b3 * (\u2207 + \u2207\u2217 ) \u2212 a2 \u2207\u2217 * \u2207 + mc .\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe parameter m\u2032q = m\u20320 \u2212 mc is hence proportional to the renormalized quark mass\nthat appears in the PCAC Ward identity: the massless theory is obtained for m\u20320 =\nmc (g02 ). Gauge configurations U are generated via suitable algorithms with probability\nP [U ; g02 , m\u2032q ], and on each configuration U the quark propagator from the lattice site x\nto the site y, [DW,c + m\u2032q ]\u22121 (y, x), can be computed \u2013for fixed x\u2013 by solving a linear\nsystem. By expanding the correlator (2.2) around the trivial perturbative vacuum, one\n4\n\nThe symbol tr{. . .} denotes the trace over flavour, colour and spin indices, whereas the symbol\ndet{. . .} stands for the determinant with respect to all indices, including the space-time ones.\n\n2\n\n\fcan easily check that in eq. (2.3) the trace term involving quark propagators corresponds\nto valence quark diagrams dressed with any kind of purely gluonic corrections, whereas\nthe term det(DW,c + m\u2032q ) accounts for the sea quark corrections to the aforementioned\ndressed valence quark diagrams.\n2.2\n\nQuenched and partially quenched lattice QCD\n\nIt is well-known that with the established simulation techniques the simulation of the full\ntheory, including the sea quark effects, has a very high computational cost, which quickly\nincreases as the pion mass is decreased towards realistic values. On the other hand, it\nis technically trivial to choose different values for the parameter m\u2032q that appears in the\nfermionic determinant and its counterpart in the inverse Dirac operator: m\u2032q,sea 6= m\u2032q,val .\nA moment of thought reveals that such a modification of lattice QCD corresponds to\na statistical model with extra spin-1/2 ghost fields, which is local and renormalizable\nby power counting but violates reflection positivity (see e.g. Ref. [5]). The general case\nm\u2032q,val 6= m\u2032q,sea is referred to as partially quenched QCD, whereas the particular case\n|m\u2032q,val | < |m\u2032q,sea | = \u221e corresponds to the well-known quenched approximation.\nIt should be noted that these approximations in general break down as the valence\nquark mass m\u2032q,val \u2192 0 in the thermodynamic limit. In this regime the flavour chiral\nsymmetry is spontaneously broken: if the chiral condensate is to be non-vanishing,\nthe gauge configurations carrying zero modes of the Dirac operator must receive a\nfinite weight in the Euclidean path integral, even in the limit (taken at infinite spatial\nvolume) m\u2032q,sea = m\u2032q,val \u2192 0 [6]. It is clear that in the full theory the integration over\nthe fermionic variables on any gauge background can not yield divergences: in presence\nof quark zero modes the infinities in the quark propagators must be compensated by\nthe zeros in the fermion determinant, see eq. (2.3). Such a delicate compensation is\nno longer guaranteed if the condition m\u2032q,sea = m\u2032q,val is violated: fermionic observables\nmay hence diverge on gauge configurations carrying quark zero modes, which causes the\nbreakdown of the quenched and partially quenched approximations.\nHowever, when working sufficiently away from the thermodynamic chiral limit, the\nquenched \u2013or partially quenched\u2013 approximation is expected to be reasonably accurate,\nat least for those quantities that are not very sensitive to sea quark effects. An example is\ngiven by the ratios of hadron masses [7], with the \u03b7 \u2032 -meson mass being the most striking\nexception. Indeed, given the high computational cost of simulating the full theory, the\nquenched approximation has been widely used as a testbed for lattice techniques and\nfor first non-perturbative estimates of quantities such as renormalized couplings, hadron\nmasses and matrix elements, order parameters of phase transitions. The chiral effective\nLagrangian for quenched QCD has also been worked out [5] with the aim of identifying\nand parameterising the deviations from the full theory close to the chiral limit.\nAnalogous remarks apply for the partially quenched approximation, the quality\nof which depends on the ratio m\u2032q,sea /m\u2032q,val . In particular, it has been remarked that\nthe low-energy (Gasser-Leutwyler) constants of partially quenched QCD with Nf quark\nflavours coincide with those of the fully unquenched theory, provided that all the quark\nflavours are light enough for the chiral perturbation theory to be applicable [8]. In\nthe physically relevant cases, which are Nf = 3 and \u2013to some extent\u2013 Nf = 2, varying\n\n3\n\n\fm\u2032q,val while keeping fixed m\u2032q,sea can then be very convenient, since it allows to investigate the dependence of the observables on m\u2032q,val without performing many unquenched\nsimulations.\n\n3\n\nLattice tmQCD\n\nLattice tmQCD is an extension of the widely used formulation with Wilson quarks,\nfrom which it differs in that the physically non-vanishing quark mass term is in general\nnot aligned with the Wilson term in the flavour chiral space. This simple modification\nbrings definite advantages concerning the simulations with light quarks \u2013especially in\nthe quenched or partially quenched case\u2013 and the renormalization properties of some\nphenomenologically important quantities, such as the leptonic decay amplitude of pseu0\ndoscalar mesons or the mixing amplitude in the K 0 -K system [9,10,11].\n3.1\n\nLattice Wilson quarks and spurious zero modes\n\nWhile the considerations of Subsections 2.1\u20132.2, apply to any sensible lattice regularization of QCD, working with Wilson fermions entails a further technical problem that\nrenders particularly difficult \u2013or even impossible\u2013 the simulations with light quarks. The\nproblem arises whenever the quenched (or partially quenched) sample of configurations,\nas determined by a given choice of the bare parameters, includes gauge backgrounds on\nwhich the critical Wilson-Dirac operator DW,c , eq. (2.4), has one or more eigenvalues\nwith negative real part Re(\u03bb) < 0 and (almost) zero imaginary part. Under these conditions, the massive Dirac operator DW,c + m\u2032q,val is singular for values of m\u2032q,val > 0 as\nsoon as m\u2032q,val + Re(\u03bb) = 0 for some of the real negative eigenvalues \u03bb.\nThe fermionic observables, which involve [DW,c + m\u2032q,val ]\u22121 , may receive (almost)\ndivergent contributions on the aforementioned gauge backgrounds, spoiling the expected\ndecrease of the statistical errors with the number of independent measurements [12].\nAs an example of this phenomenon, we show in Fig. 1 the Monte Carlo history of the\nnormalized relative standard deviation for the pion channel correlator f \u2261 fP11 (x0 ) at\nx0 = 24a = T /2, see Section 4.1. The normalization of the standard deviation is such\nthat it should approach a constant in the limit of infinite statistics: in the case of\nthe standard Wilson regularization, which corresponds to the open symbols in Fig. 1,\nthe problem is apparent. Via the combined effect of lattice artifacts and statistical\nfluctuations, \"spurious\" quark zero modes5 anticipate at non-vanishing values of m\u2032q\nthe breakdown of the quenched or partially quenched approximation.\nIn practice, in the quenched case the rate of occurrence of gauge backgrounds with\nspurious quark zero modes \u2013also called \"exceptional configurations\"\u2013 depends on the\nvalues of m\u2032q,val and g02 , on the physical linear size L of the lattice and on various details\nof the lattice regularization. The rate tends to increase when decreasing m\u2032q,val and\nincreasing g02 and L/a, as well as when switching on the coefficient, csw (g02 ), of the counterterm that is needed for the on-shell O(a) improvement of the fermionic action. For\ninstance, in the regularization with plaquette gauge action and non-perturbatively O(a)\n5\n\nThese spurious quark zero modes should not be confused with the quark zero modes that play an\nimportant physical role in the thermodynamic chiral limit of renormalized QCD.\n\n4\n\n\fimproved Wilson quarks, the problem is felt for L \u2265 1.5 fm at values of g02 corresponding\nto a \u223c 0.1 fm and at valence quark masses that are about half the strange quark mass.\nA similar problem is also expected in partially quenched simulations, although with a\nlower rate depending on the ratio m\u2032q,val /m\u2032q,sea , and has indeed been observed, see e.g.\nRef. [13].\nIn the fully unquenched case, one can expect troubles at the algorithmic level\nwith light Wilson quarks on rather coarse lattices. This is because the state-of-theart algorithms implement stochastically the fermion determinant that appears in the\nprobability measure for the gauge configurations: almost exceptional configurations may\nhence be proposed, but are then almost certainly rejected. In this process however the\nsimulation algorithm, e.g. the standard HMC one6 , undergoes a severe slowing-down,\ndue to a decrease in the acceptance rate and an increment of the condition number of\nthe Dirac matrix before the accept/reject test.\n3.2\n\nAction and symmetries\n\nAs already known since 1989 [15], the problem with spurious quark zero modes is absent\nin the two-flavour theory if one considers the action\nX\n\u03c8(x)[(DW,c + mq + i\u03bcq \u03b35 \u03c4 3 )\u03c8](x) ,\n(3.1)\nSW [U, \u03c8, \u03c8] = Sg + a4\nx\n\nwhere \u03c8 is a flavour quark doublet, the matrix \u03c4 3 acts in the flavour space and the\nboundary conditions for finite-volume systems may remain unspecified for a while. Since\nmc is known in practice with finite precision, the exactly known bare parameters are g02 ,\n\u03bcq and m0 = mc +mq . It is easy to see that, as long as \u03bcq 6= 0, on any gauge background\nthe lowest eigenvalue of the Hermitean square of the matrix (DW,c + mq + i\u03bcq \u03b35 \u03c4 3 ) is\nbounded from below by (a\u03bcq )2 .\nThe action (3.1) represents a sensible regularization of QCD with Nf = 2 massdegenerate quark flavours, but in a quark field basis that is chirally twisted with respect\nto the standard one [9]. To illustrate this point, let us focus on the simple case mq = 0,\n\u03bcq 6= 0, and consider the very same lattice theory in the standard quark field basis,\nwhich is obtained by a suitable axial rotation with generator \u03c4 3 :\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03bcq\n\u03c0\n\u03c43\n\u03c43\n= .\n\u03c8,\n,\n\u03c9 = arctan\n\u03c7 = \u03c8 exp i\u03c9\u03b35\n\u03c7 = exp i\u03c9\u03b35\n2\n2\nmq\n2\n(3.2)\nThe action (3.1) then reads\nX\nSW [U, \u03c7, \u03c7] = Sg + a4\n\u03c7(x)[(DtmW,c + \u03bcq )\u03c7](x) ,\n(3.3)\nx\n\nwhere\nDtmW,c = 21 \u03b3 * (\u2207 + \u2207\u2217 ) + i a2 \u03b35 \u03c4 3 \u2207\u2217 * \u2207 \u2212 i\u03b35 \u03c4 3 mc .\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe connection, eq. (3.2), between the two lattice quark bases makes obvious that\nthe chiral limit is obtained for mq = \u03bcq = 0 with mc being the usual function of\n6\n\nEvidence for a large increase of the fermionic force at small quark mass values is reported in Ref. [14].\n\n5\n\n\fg02 . Inspection of the symmetries of the action (3.3) shows that in the chiral limit one\nvector and two axial generators \u2013out of the six generators of the flavour chiral group\u2013\nare preserved by the lattice regularization, while parity is preserved only up to a flavour\nexchange (PF symmetry) and all other symmetries are as usual with Wilson fermions. It\nfollows that \u03bcq is multiplicatively renormalized, \u03bcR = Z\u03bc (g02 ) \u03bcq , while mR = Zm (g02 ) mq .\nPower counting renormalizability and the recovery of the full flavour chiral symmetry in\nthe continuum limit [3], together with the exact PF invariance, imply that parity must\nalso be recovered in the continuum limit. In contrast with other approaches based on\nthe action (3.1) [12], the correlation functions of the massive QCD are obtained at finite\n\u03bcq , so that the problem with the spurious quark zero modes is certainly solved.\nIn the general case, where both mq and \u03bcq are non-vanishing, the situation is\nfully analogous, but the relation between the two lattice quark bases involves an angle\n\u03c9 6= \u03c0/2. However, owing to the complications arising from the Wilson term, it is\nconvenient to perform first the renormalization (and possibly the O(a) improvement)\nof the correlation functions in a given quark basis and then transform to the \"physical\"\nbasis, i.e. the one where the quark mass is coupled to the singlet scalar density. The\n2, m , \u03bc\nfirst step implies that the continuum limit is approached at fixed values of gR\nR\nR\nand the normalization conditions for the composite fields. Concerning the second step,\nfor a wide class of renormalization schemes, the relation between the renormalized fields\nin two different bases that are related via a non-singlet axial rotation takes the same\nform as at the classical level [9]. In terms of polar quark mass coordinates,\nq\n\u03bcR\n, MR = \u03bc2R + m2R ,\n(3.5)\ntan \u03b1 =\nmR\nthe angle \u03b1 identifies the quark basis and hence specifies the axial rotation with generator\n\u03c4 3 /2 that allows to combine the renormalized correlation functions so to obtain finite\ncorrelators with given continuum quantum numbers7 . On the latter correlators the\npartial breaking of isospin and parity is an effect of order a\u03bcR and represents no serious\ndrawback.\nIf one identifies the two quark flavours with the u and d quark, the tiny mass difference between them can safely be taken into account by means of chiral perturbation theory. Alternatively, lattice tmQCD can also be formulated for a doublet of non-degenerate\nquarks, whilst retaining the protection against spurious quark zero modes [17]. Heavier\nflavours of Wilson quarks can be added e.g. in the usual way to the lattice tmQCD\naction for Nf = 2.\n\n4\n\nA test-study of lattice tmQCD with light quarks and in large volume\n\nWe present here some preliminary results of a high-statistics exploratory study of lattice\ntmQCD in the thermodynamic chiral regime. The study aimed at testing the absence of\nexceptional configurations, the computational cost and the magnitude of cutoff effects\nfor a few typical observables. We adopt in the following the notation of Ref. [19], to the\nequations of which we refer with the prefix \"I\", and postpone many technical details to\na forthcoming publication [20].\n7\nThis point of view might lead to a reinterpretation of the \"spontaneous breakdown of parity and\nisospin\" in lattice QCD with Wilson fermions [16], which was observed by employing the action (3.1).\n\n6\n\n\f4.1\n\nObservables and simulations\n\nIn this test-study we choose to work in the quark basis of action (3.1) and implement the\nnon-perturbative O(a) improvement of the action and the relevant operators along the\nlines of Ref. [18]. Attention is restricted to the pseudoscalar and vector meson masses,\nMPS and MV , the pseudoscalar (leptonic) decay constant, FPS , and the polar quark\nmasses, MR and \u03b1, which are defined according to eqs.

The statistics is specified by the number\nof measurements, Nmeas , on almost independent gauge configurations, while the values\nof m0 and \u03bcq can be found in Ref. [20].\nWe work in the quenched approximation considering systems of physical size L3 T\nwith L such that MPS L \u2265 4.5 to suppress finite volume effects. In practice we take\nL = 1.5 fm or L = 2.2 fm and T /L = 2 \u00f7 3. Following Ref. [19], we impose boundary\nconditions of Schr\u00f6dinger functional (SF) type and compute the SF correlators\nfA11 (x0 ) ,\n\nfP11 (x0 ) ,\n\nfV12 (x0 ) ,\n\n11\nkV\n(x0 ) ,\n\n11\nkT\n(x0 ) ,\n\n12\nkA\n(x0 ) ,\n\nf111 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nWe hence construct the linear combinations of renormalized and O(a) improved SF\ncorrelators that correspond to operator insertions (at time x0 ) with well defined continuum quantum numbers, see eqs. (I.3.10)\u2013(I.3.11) with \u03b1 given by eq. (3.5). Namely,\nthe correlators [fA11\u2032 ]R (x0 ) and [fP11\u2032 ]R (x0 ) correspond to the insertion of the isotriplet\n11 ] (x ) and [k 11 ] (x )\npseudoscalar operators (A\u2032R )10 and (PR\u2032 )1 , while the correlators [kV\n\u2032 R\n0\nT\u2032 R 0\ncorrespond to the insertion of the isotriplet vector operators (VR\u2032 )1k and (TR\u2032 )1k0 . In the\nlimit of large x0 and large (T \u2212 x0 ) and up to cutoff effects, these non-vanishing correlators are expected to be dominated by the lowest isotriplet pseudoscalar and vector\nmeson states.\nAn overview of our simulation parameters, statistics and preliminary results for\n2 is\nrenormalized quantities is given in Table 1.

[24]. For a given number of independent measurements, the statistical\nerrors on MPS and MV are comparable, up to a factor of one to three, to those found\ne.g. with domain wall quarks [22]. The CPU time effort, e.g. for the data sets A1, A1'\nand A2, is in line with the computational cost for ordinary Wilson quarks.\nThe partial breaking of parity and isospin that is peculiar of lattice tmQCD is found\nto be a minor problem within our small statistical errors. In this respect it should be\nnoted that we work at small values of a\u03bcq , namely 0.0266 \u2265 a\u03bcq \u2265 0.0117, and consider\nobservables in physical channels where the lowest state is lighter than the lowest state of\nthe corresponding channels with flipped parity and isospin. While deferring the details\nof our analysis to Ref. [20], we show in Fig. 2 an example of effective masses extracted\nfrom SF correlators, where the correlator [fA11\u2032 ]R (x0 ) receives contributions of order a\u03bcq\nthat are visible at large x0 . Analogous effects are expected and found to be negligible\nwithin statistical errors for both [fP11\u2032 ]R (x0 ) and the vector channel correlators.\nAs detailed in Refs. [18,10], we expect the relations among our observables and the\nrenormalized parameters r0 and MR to be O(a) improved. In particular, when working\nat \u03b1 = \u03c0/2 + O(a), which is the case of our study, the knowledge of a few counterterms\n(those with coefficients Zg , mc and csw ) suffices to obtain an O(a) improved estimate of\nFPS . In order to check for the residual scaling violations, we produced data at \u03b2 = 6.2\n(sets A2 and B2), while keeping \u03b1, MR and r0 fixed. The small mismatch in MR r0 for\nthe set A2 was corrected by employing estimates of the dependence of our observables\non MR r0 .\nWe also reanalysed the data of Ref. [23], which were produced at \u03b2 = 6, 6.1, 6.2, 6.45,\nby imposing precisely the same renormalization conditions as in this study of tmQCD.\nWe then performed a continuum extrapolation of these data, assuming a purely quadratic\n8\n\n\f0.29\n\nplateau window for [fA']R\nplateau window for [fP]R\n\n0.27\naMPS(x0)\n\n0.25\n0.23\n0.21\n0.19\n0.17\n0.15\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nx0/a\nFigure 2: Pseudoscalar effective masses extracted from the correlators [fP ]R \u2261 [fP11\u2032 ]R\nand [fA\u2032 ]R \u2261 [fA11\u2032 ]R for the simulation C.

However, the resulting estimate of FPS is not fully O(a) improved, as for one of the necessary improvement\ncoefficients, bA (g02 ), only the one-loop estimate could be used. The outcome of this exercise is compared with the results from tmQCD in Figs. 3\u20134, omitting the case of MV r0\nwhere cutoff effects are hardly visible within statistical errors. The estimators of MPS\nand FPS that are obtained from lattice tmQCD show rather small cutoff effects, which\nagrees with the findings of a scaling test [19] in intermediate volume (L = 0.75 fm).\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nLattice tmQCD is well suited to perform non-perturbative studies of QCD in the chiral\n(thermodynamic or finite-volume) regime for all cases where it is technically sufficient to\nrecover chiral symmetry in the continuum limit. The framework has been successfully\ntested in the quenched approximation and can straightforwardly be extended beyond\nit.\nThe tmQCD project is part of the ALPHA Collaboration research programme.
