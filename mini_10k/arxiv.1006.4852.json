For a knot K the cube number is a knot invariant defined to be the smallest n for\nwhich there is a cube diagram of size n for K. We will show that the cube number detects chirality\nin all cases computed thus far, and distinguishes certain legendrian knots.\n\n1. Introduction\nCube diagrams are 3-dimensional representations of knots or links (c.f. [2]). A cube diagram is\na cubic lattice knot embedded in an n \u00d7 n \u00d7 n cube in R3 where each projection to an axis plane\n(x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0) is a grid diagram. The integer n is the size of the cube diagram and the\ncube number of a knot, denoted c(K), is the smallest n for which there is a cube diagram for the\nknot of size n.\nIn [3] small examples of cube diagrams of knots were given up to 7 crossings. In some cases it\nwas observed that the examples given were minimal. In each of these examples minimality was\nguaranteed since the arc index, \u03b1(K), is less than or equal to the cube number and cube diagrams\nfor K can be found with cube number equal to \u03b1(K). Cube number is a far more powerful invariant\nthan arc index. For example, \u03b1(K) = \u03b1(mK) where mK is the mirror image of K for all knots\nand links, but:\nTheorem 1 For eight of the first twelve chiral knots in Rolfsen's knot table (up to 7-crossing knots),\ncube number detects chirality and no counter example is known to exist in the remaining four cases.\nSee Theorem 4.1 for the full list of knots where cube number is known to detect chirality.\nLet K be a Legendrian knot. Define the Legendrian cube number (or cube number when the\ncontext is clear), c` (K), to be the minimum n such that there is a cube diagram for K of size n that\nprojects to a Legendrian front of K (see details in Section 5). Perhaps surprisingly, the Legendrian\ncube number detects Legendrian knot type in some cases. This fact is unexpected because there is\nno clear relationship as of yet between cube diagrams and Legendrian knots (cube diagrams do not\nnaturally embed as Legendrian knots even when they have the same Legendrian knot projections).\nIn this paper we prove:\nTheorem 2 Let Kmin be the left hand (5, 2)-torus knot with maximal Thurston-Bennequin number\nand r = \u22123 and Kmax the (5, 2)-torus knot with maximal Thurston-Bennequin number and r = 3.\nThen the Legendrian cube number distinguishes between Kmin and Kmax .\nWe conclude this paper with a conjecture that generalizes Theorem 2 to all (p, 2) torus knots\nand show that this conjecture is true if Conjecture 5.2 is true.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nB. MCCARTY\n\n2. Definition of a cube diagram\nLet n \u2208 Z+ and \u0393 an n \u00d7 n \u00d7 n cube, thought of as a 3-dimensional Cartesian grid with integervalued vertices. A flat of \u0393 is any cuboid (a right rectangular prism) with integer vertices in \u0393 such\nthat there are two orthogonal edges of length n with the remaining orthogonal edge of length 1. A\nflat with an edge of length 1 that is parallel to the x-axis, y-axis, or z-axis is called an x-flat, y-flat,\nor z-flat respectively. Note that the cube itself is canonically oriented by the standard orientation\nof R3 (right hand orientation).\n\nFigure 1: Lefthand trefoil cube diagram.\n\nA marking is a labeled half-integer point in \u0393. We mark unit cubes of \u0393 with either an X, Y , or\nZ such that the following marking conditions hold:\n\u2022 each flat has exactly one X, one Y , and one Z marking;\n\u2022 the markings in each flat form a right angle such that each segment is parallel to a coordinate axis;\n\u2022 for each x-flat, y-flat, or z-flat, the marking that is the vertex of the right angle is an X, Y,\nor Z marking respectively.\nWe get an oriented link in \u0393 by connecting pairs of markings with a line segment whenever two\nof their corresponding coordinates are the same. Each line segment is oriented to go from an X to\na Y , from a Y to a Z, or from a Z to an X. The markings in each flat define two perpendicular\nsegments of the link L joined at a vertex, call the union of these segments a cube bend. If a cube\nbend is contained in an x-flat, we call it an x-cube bend. Similarly, define y-cube bends and z-cube\nbends.\n\nFigure 2: Crossing conditions of the knot at every intersection in each projection.\n\nArrange the markings in \u0393 so that at every intersection point of the (x, y)-projection (i.e.,\n\u03c0z : R3 \u2192 R3 given by \u03c0z (x, y, z) = (x, y)), the segment parallel to the x-axis has smaller zcoordinate than the segment parallel to the y-axis. Similarly, arrange so that in the (y, z)-projection,\n\n\fCUBE NUMBER PROPERTIES\n\n3\n\nz-parallel segments cross over the y-parallel segments, and in the (z, x)-projection, the x-parallel\nsegments cross over the z-parallel segments (see Figure 2).\nA set of markings in \u0393 satisfying the marking conditions and crossing conditions is called a cube\ndiagram for the knot or link.\n\n3. Liftability of grid diagrams\nBecause cube diagrams project to grid diagrams, it is natural to think of a cube diagram as a\nlift of a grid diagram corresponding to, say, the (x, y)-projection of the cube. However, such lifts\ndo not always exist (c.f. [2] and [3]).\nBefore proceeding, we need to establish some terminology and facts about grid diagrams (for\nmore details see [2]). Grid diagrams will be oriented so that vertical edges are directed from X to\nO. A bend in a grid diagram, G, is a pair of segments that meet at a common X or O marking. We\nwill refer to the former pair of segments as an X-bend and the latter as an O-bend. There are two\nways to decompose any link component in G into a set of non-overlapping bends, corresponding to\na choice of X-bends or O-bends. In particular, for a knot there are only two ways to decompose G\ninto non-overlapping bends, and such a choice will be called a bend decomposition.\nConsider a grid diagram, G, together with a choice of a bend decomposition. If possible we\nwish to lift G to a cube diagram where G is the (x, y)-projection of the cube diagram and the\nbend decomposition of G determines the z-cube bends of the cube diagram. While G carries with\nit an orientation on the knot, so does the (x, y)-projection of the cube diagram. In order that\nthese orientations agree, the X-bend decompositon of G has to be chosen\u2013O-bends cannot be lifted\nto z-cube bends. Furthermore, because of the symmetry between all three projections in a cube\ndiagram, it is enough to work only with the (x, y)-projection and lift X-bends to z-cube bends.\nThe crossings in a grid diagram sometimes generate a partial order on the X-bends. Let b1\nand b2 be two X-bends. If b1 crosses over b2 in G we say that b1 > b2 . Thus in any lift of G,\nthe z-cube bend corresponding to b1 must have z-coordinate greater than that of the z-cube bend\ncorresponding to b2 .\nOf course, not every grid diagram has a partial order on the X-bends. A grid diagram for which\nthere is no partial order on the X-bends may not even lift to a lattice knot that has well-defined\nknot projections in the other planes (Figure 5 of [2]). However, if there is a partial ordering on the\nX-bends of the grid diagram, it will lift to a lattice knot in which all projections are well-defined\nknot projections (c.f. [2]). Nevertheless, even a partial order doesn't guarantee liftability to a\ncube diagram as the (y, z)- and (z, x)-projections may not be grid diagrams in such a lift (c.f [2]\nand [3]). Below, we will introduce some grid configurations that fail to lift, not because of a lack\nof partial ordering but due to crossings in the (y, z)- or (z, x)-projections that do not satisfy the\ncrossing conditions for a cube diagram. In Figures 3 and 4, the shaded regions are determined\nby the corresponding X-bend and extend from the X-bend to the boundary of the grid diagram\nas indicated. Furthermore, a dotted edge represents a sequence of edges in the grid that remains\nin the shaded region. This condition is required in the proofs that follow to guarantee that the\n(y, z)- or (z, x)-projections contain crossings that do not satisfy the crossing conditions for a cube\ndiagram.\nTheorem 3.1. The Type 1 configurations shown in Figure 3 do not appear in the projection of a\ncube diagram.\n\n\f4\n\nB. MCCARTY\n\nFigure 3: Type 1 configurations.\nProof. We will prove the result for the center configuration. The remaining cases are similar. If\nwe assume first that there is a partial order on the X-bends of the grid diagram, then the shaded\nregion must contain an O marking. If there is no O marking in the shaded region, then a and b\nmust end at the same X mark, and thus there is no partial order on the X-bends, and no lift.\nIn any lift of the grid to a lattice knot satisfying the marking conditions for a cube diagram at\nleast one such O marking must represent a vertical edge that passes through the flat containing\nthe X-bend shown, since a is below the bend and b is above. Since this z-parallel edge is located\nin the shaded region, it must either cross over the x-parallel edge shown in the (z, x)-projection\nor behind the y-parallel edge shown in the (y, z)-projection, which breaks the crossing condition\nshown in Figure 2.\n\u0003\n\nFigure 4: Type 2 configurations.\n\nTheorem 3.2. The Type 2 configurations shown in Figure 4 do not appear in the projection of a\ncube diagram.\nProof. For the first configuration shown in Figure 4, if the edge ending in a has z-coordinate less\nthan the lower X-bend then the sequence of edges connecting a to b must contain an O-marking.\nThat O-marking corresponds to a z-parallel edge that crosses behind that lower X-bend in the\n(y, z)-projection. Otherwise, the edge ending in a is above that lower X-bend. In this case, the\nsequence of edges connecting a0 to b0 must contain an O-marking that corresponds to a z-parallel\nedge that crosses above the edge ending in a in the (z, x)-projection. A similar argument will show\nthat the other configuration fails to lift as well.\n\u0003\n\n\fCUBE NUMBER PROPERTIES\n\n5\n\n4. Cube number and chirality\nTheorem 4.1. The cube number detects the chirality of the trefoil. That is, if KL is the left hand\ntrefoil and KR is the right hand trefoil, then c(KL ) < c(KR ).\n\nFigure 5: Minimal right hand trefoil grid diagrams.\n\nRemark 4.2. The cube number of the left hand trefoil is 5 and the cube number of the right hand\ntrefoil is 7.\nProof. Note first that c(KL ) = \u03b1(KL ) (see Figure 1). For the right hand trefoil, Figure 5 shows all\nminimal grid diagrams. For columns 1, 4, and 5 there is a Type 1 configuration present in the grid\n(shown in blue and marked by the X-bend). For columns 2 and 3 there is either no partial order\non the bends or there is a Type 2 configuration (shown in blue and marked by the X-bend).\n\u0003\nFor all examples that have been computed, the cube number detects the chirality of the knot as\nin Theorem 4.1. For knots with arc index greater than 5 proofs of this nature become infeasible.\nHowever, a computer can do the same basic checks for Type 1 and Type 2 configurations. A\nprogram was written that generates all grid diagrams, sifts out those that contain Type 1 and 2\nconfigurations, and then attempts to lift the remaining diagrams to cube diagrams. Upon finding\na valid cube diagram, the Jones polynomial is computed to identify the knot type. This program\nhas been successfully run up to size 9 diagrams, generating the following result:\nTheorem 4.3. The cube number detects the chirality of the following knots: 52 , 72 , 73 , 74 , 75 , 819 ,\n949 , 10124 , 10128 , 10139 , 10145 , 10161 , 12n591 , and the (3, 2), (5, 2), and (7, 2) torus knots.\nFor most knots mentioned in Theorem 4.3 one knot has cube number equal to arc index and all\nthat is known is that the mirror image has cube number strictly greater than arc index. However,\nthe calculation has also yielded the result that the cube number for the right hand trefoil is equal\nto 7 and the cube number for the right hand (5, 2) torus knot is 10 (the program found no diagrams\nfor the right hand (5, 2) torus knot of size 9 or less and an example of size 10 exists).\n5. Cube number and Legendrian type\nAny grid diagram represents the front projection of a Legendrian knot by following this procedure.\nFirst smooth the northeast and southwest corners. Then convert northwest and southeast corners\nto cusps and rotate the grid diagram 45 degrees counterclockwise. Note that some authors (see\n\n\f6\n\nB. MCCARTY\n\n[10]) describe a similar procedure to obtain a Legendrian projection for the mirror image of the\nknot represented by G, while the one described here is for the original knot type represented by\nG. While there is no similar construction to convert a cube diagram into a Legendrian knot, each\nof the projections of a cube diagram is a grid diagram, and hence, represents the Legendrian front\nprojection of some knot. Therefore one can define the Legendrian cube number, c` (K), to be the\nsmallest n such that there is a cube diagram for the knot K of size n where the (x, y)-projection\nof the cube diagram is a grid diagram representing the Legendrian knot K.\nAccording to [8] the rotation number may be computed from the Legendrian front projection as\nfollows:\n1\nr(K) = (Dc \u2212 Uc )\n2\nwhere Dc is the number of downward oriented cusps and Uc is the number of upward oriented\ncusps in the Legendrian front projection. Furthermore, according to [8] and [9], any minimal grid\ndiagram for a left hand Legendrian torus knot, Tp,2 , must realize the maximal Thurston Bennequin\nnumber and hence have rotation number satisfying:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n|p| \u2212 2\n.\nr(K) \u2208 \u00b1(|p| \u2212 2 \u2212 4t) : t \u2208 Z, 0 \u2264 t <\n2\nFor the following results we will need to refer to a standard diagram, Gj,k , for a (p, 2)-torus knot. A\nstandard diagram for Tp,2 is one that contains all crossings along two diagonals as shown in Figure\n6 (note that there is a similar notion of standard diagram for right hand (p, 2)-torus knots). For\nthe standard diagram shown in Figure 6 the rotation number may be computed as follows:\n1\nr(Gj,k ) = (2k \u2212 2j) = k \u2212 j.\n2\nNote that each Legendrian left hand (p, 2)-torus knot realizable in a minimal grid diagram is\nrepresented by a standard grid diagram. Also the standard diagram with maximum rotation number\nis one in which k = p \u2212 1 (recall that p = k + j). Similarly the standard diagram with minimum\nrotation number has j = p \u2212 1.\n\nFigure 6: Standard diagram Gj,k where j + k = p and j, k \u2265 1.\n\n\fCUBE NUMBER PROPERTIES\n\n7\n\nTheorem 5.1. Let Kmin be the left hand (5, 2)-torus knot with maximal Thurston-Bennequin\nnumber and r = \u22123 and Kmax the (5, 2)-torus knot with maximal Thurston-Bennequin number and\nr = 3. Then the Legendrian cube number distinguishes between Kmin and Kmax .\nProof. Note first that c` (Kmax ) = \u03b1(T5,2 ) (the construction shown in Figure 1 extends to T5,2 ).\nNow, for Kmin all minimal grid diagrams can be reached from the standard one (see Figure 7) by\ncyclic permutation. This fact has been verified by a computer program that determines the total\nnumber of grid diagrams of a given Legendrian knot. In this case the program confirmed that\nthere are only 49 distinct minimal diagrams for Kmin , precisely those that may be reached from\nthe standard diagram by cyclic permutation. Finally, cyclic permutations do not eliminate all of\nthe Type 1 configurations present in each of the 49 diagrams. Therefore c` (Kmin ) > \u03b1(T5,2 ).\n\u0003\nThere are also further results regarding cube number and Legendrian knot type. A computer\nprogram has been used to show that cube number distinguishes between the Legendrian (7, 2) torus\nknots with tb = 0 and r = \u00b15. The following conjecture has been verified up to p = 7 by a computer\nprogram.\nConjecture 5.2. Given a torus knot Tp,2 and a legendrian knot KL of topological type Tp,2 and a\ngrid diagram for KL of size \u03b1(Tp,2 ). Then there is a sequence of commutation and cyclic permutation moves taking KL to the standard grid diagram representing it.\nTo understand the conjecture, we must first define what is meant by commutation and cyclic\npermutation. A cyclic permutation of a grid diagram takes a column (resp. row) adjacent to\nthe boundary of the grid, and moves it to the opposite end of the grid (c.f. [6]). Two adjacent\ncolumns (resp. rows) are said to be interleaved if the y-coordinates (resp. x-coordinates) of the\nmarkings are distinct and alternate between the columns (resp. rows). A commutation switches\nthe position of any two adjacent rows (resp. columns) that are not interleaved, including pairs\nthat are adjacent with respect to the boundary (c.f. [2]). Note that the grid may be thought of\nas existing on a torus, so opposite edges may be identified (hence the commutation move includes\nrows and columns adjacent to the boundaries). Furthermore, using this definition of commutation,\ncommutation and cyclic permutation commute.\nConjecture 5.3. Let Kmax and Kmin be left hand Legendrian torus knots with p \u2265 5 and maximal\nThurston-Bennequin number such that the rotation number of Kmax is maximal and the rotation\nnumber of Kmin is minimal. Then c` (Kmax ) < c` (Kmin ).\nProof (Assuming conjecture 5.2). As in the proof of Theorem 5.1 the cube diagram shown in Figure\n1 extends to give a cube diagram for Kmax of size equal to the arc index. Also for p = 5 this result\nis precisely Theorem 5.1. A similar argument shows that the result holds for p = 7 as well. Assume\nnow that p \u2265 9. Since cyclic permutation commutes with commutation, all commutation moves\nmay be moved to the beginning of the sequence. Since the standard grid diagram for Kmin has no\npossible commutation moves, it suffices to consider only cyclic permutations. Consider a sequence\nof cyclic permutation moves. Such a sequence is equivalent one in which the first a moves are cyclic\npermutations down (i.e. moving the bottom row to the top of the grid) and the remaining moves,\ndenote the number of moves by b, are cyclic permutations to the left (i.e. moving the left column to\nthe right side of the grid). Also, note that doing a cyclic permutations down is equivalent to doing\nn \u2212 a cyclic permutations up. Similarly, doing b cyclic permutations left is equivalent to doing n \u2212 b\ncyclic permutations right.\n\n\f8\n\nB. MCCARTY\n\nFigure 7: Standard diagrams for the (p, 2) torus knot with r = \u2212(p \u2212 2) and r = p \u2212 2 respectively.\nNow, if a \u2264 n \u2212 4 and b \u2264 n \u2212 5 the upper right most Type 1 configuration (labeled X1 in Figure\n7) will remain fixed. If a \u2265 5 and b \u2265 4 then the lower left most Type 1 configuration (labeled X2\nin Figure 7) remains. If a > n \u2212 4 and b < 4, or if a < 5 and b > n \u2212 5 then the Type 1 configuration\nlabeled X3 remains.\n\u0003\nNote that while chirality is detected in all examples computed so far, it is not true that cube\nnumber always detects legendrian knot type. There are multiple examples of left hand (p, 2) torus\nknots that are of different Legendrian types yet still have cube number equal to arc index. For\nexample, when p = 7 all left hand Legendrian (p, 2) torus knots realizable in a minimal grid diagram\nhave cube number equal to arc index except for those with rotation number equal to \u22123 and \u22125.\nReferences\n[1] Y.
