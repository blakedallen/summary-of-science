V. Kartashov et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 96, 073901 (2006)]. We demonstrate strong self-trapping at the edge of a LiNbO3\nwaveguide array and the formation of staggered surface solitons with propagation constant inside the\nfirst photonic band gap. We study the crossover between linear repulsion and nonlinear attraction\nat the surface, revealing the mechanism of nonlinearity-mediated stabilization of the surface gap\nmodes.\nPACS numbers: 42.65.Tg, 42.65.Sf5, 42.65.Wi\n\nInterfaces between different physical media can support a special class of localized waves known as surface\nwaves or surface modes. In periodic systems, staggered\nsurface modes are often referred to as Tamm states [1],\nfirst identified as localized electronic states at the edge\nof a truncated periodic potential. Because of the difficulties in observing this type of surface waves in natural\nmaterials such as crystals, successful efforts were made\nto demonstrate their existence in nano-engineered periodic structures or superlattices [2]. An optical analog of\nlinear Tamm states has been described theoretically and\ndemonstrated experimentally for an interface separating\nperiodic and homogeneous dielectric media [3, 4].\nNonlinear surface waves have been studied in different\nfields of physics and most extensively in optics where surface TE and TM modes were predicted and analyzed for\nthe interfaces between two different homogeneous nonlinear dielectric media [5, 6, 7]. In addition, nonlinear effects\nhave been shown to stabilize surface waves in discrete\nsystems, generating different types of modes localized at\nand near the surface [8]. Self-trapping of light near the\nboundary of a self-focusing photonic lattice has recently\nbeen predicted theoretically [9] and demonstrated in experiment [10] through the formation of discrete surface\nsolitons at the edge of a waveguide array.\nRecently, Kartashov et al. [11] predicted theoretically\nthe existence of surface gap solitons at the interface between a uniform medium and a photonic lattice with defocusing nonlinearity. In such systems, light localization\noccurs inside a photonic bandgap in the form of staggered surface modes. This enables us to draw an analogy\nwith the localized electronic Tamm states and extend it\nto the nonlinear regime, so that the surface gap solitons\ncan be termed as nonlinear Tamm states. They posses\na unique combination of properties related to both elec-\n\ntronic and optical surface waves and discrete optical gap\nsolitons. The ability to generate such surface gap solitons\ncould provide novel and effective experimental tools for\nthe study of nonlinear effects near surfaces with possible\napplications in optical sensing and switching.\nIn this Letter we study experimentally self-action of\na narrow beam propagating near the edge of a LiNbO3\nwaveguide array with defocusing nonlinearity. For the\nfirst time to our knowledge, we observe the formation of\nsurface gap solitons, or nonlinear Tamm states. While\nlinear surface modes do not exist in this type of system,\ndiscrete light self-trapping is observed in the nonlinear\nregime above a certain threshold power when the propagation constant is shifted into the gap of the photonic\ntransmission spectrum. By employing a simple nonlinear discrete model [12], we describe the crossover from\ndiscrete diffraction and surface repulsion in the linear\nregime, to the appearance of a purely nonlinear localized surface state at higher optical intensities. We discuss the physical mechanism of the nonlinearity-induced\nstabilization of the staggered surface modes.\nIn our experiments, we study nonlinear surface localization in a semi-infinite array of single-mode optical\nwaveguides fabricated by a Titanium in-diffusion process\nin a mono-crystal lithium niobate (LiNbO3 ) wafer, similar to that recently used for the observation of discrete\ngap solitons [13, 14]. The fabrication process, described\nin Ref. [14], results in a high-quality waveguide array\nwith refractive index contrast \u2206n = 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 , waveguide\nspacing d = 9.0 \u03bcm, sample length 50 mm, and a total of\n100 waveguides.

Grey\nshading marks the waveguide positions.\n\nprobe beam from a cw Nd:YVO4 laser (\u03bb = 532 nm) is\nfocused by a microscope objective (\u00d720) to a full width\nat half-maximum (FWHM) of 2.7 \u03bcm at the input face of\nthe sample, and injected into the waveguide at the edge\nof the array. The propagated wavepacket at the output of\nthe sample is imaged onto a CCD camera. The FWHM of\nthe individual waveguide mode is 6 \u03bcm and 3 \u03bcm in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, allowing for a\nsingle-waveguide input coupling. The waveguide array is\nexternally illuminated by a white-light source in order to\ncontrol the nonlinear response time. As shown in Ref. [14]\nsingle site excitation provides an efficient method for excitation of gap solitons in periodic defocusing nonlinear\nmaterials, provided the refractive index contrast exceeds\na certain threshold. In this case the periodic structure\nappears equivalent to a discrete system [14] and can be\nwell described by a nonlinear discrete model.\nAt low laser power (P = 0.1 \u03bcW), we observe two major effects. First, due to coupling between neighboring\nwaveguides the probe beam experiences discrete diffraction and spreads out in the horizontal plane upon propagation. Second, the beam shifts dramatically to the\n\nright indicating a strong repulsive effect of the surface.\nFigure 1(a) shows the experimental output image and\nthe corresponding transverse intensity profile. After linear propagation through the array the beam profile acquires a complex form, spanning about 30 waveguides.\nThe major lobe is centered approximately 42 lattice sites\naway from the input excitation point (n = 0 at the\nedge of the array) due to the surface repulsion. Figure 1(b) shows the corresponding optical intensity distribution inside the sample, calculated with the help of a\nsimple analytical formula derived from a discrete model\nan (z\u03ba) = A0 in [Jn (2z\u03ba)+Jn+2 (2z\u03ba)], where an (z\u03ba) is the\ndiscrete mode amplitude in the n-th waveguide, A0 is the\ninitial field amplitude in the input waveguide n = 0, z is\nthe propagation distance, and \u03ba is the intersite coupling\ncoefficient [9]. In Fig. 1(b) the discrete mode amplitudes\nhave been multiplied by the continuous waveguide mode\nintensity profile, and the agreement with the experimental observation is found to be excellent. The coupling\ncoefficient is estimated to be \u03ba = 0.46 mm\u22121 , implying a\ntotal longitudinal propagation of 23 coupling lengths.\nIncreasing the laser power leads to spatial beam selfaction through the defocusing photovoltaic nonlinearity. The slow response of the nonlinearity allows us to\nmonitor directly the transient temporal dynamics of selftrapping and soliton formation, providing additional information about the localization process. Figures 1(ce) show the output beam intensity profile at times 920,\n1050, and 1550 s, respectively, after the beam power is increased to P = 0.5 mW. The wavepacket is seen first to\ncontract and shift towards the edge of the array, indicating a nonlinearity-induced suppression of the surface repulsion [Fig. 1(c)]. Then partial self-trapping at the surface occurs, with a tail of intensity lobes extending into\nthe periodic structure [Fig. 1(d)]. A series of zero intensity points between these lobes indicates the self-induced\ndynamic formation of a staggered phase structure which\nis clearly absent in Fig. 1(c). Eventually, a strongly localized surface gap soliton is formed [Fig. 1(e)]. The asymmetry of the photonic structure is reflected in the shape\nof the trapped beam which decays monotonically into\nthe continuum while showing damped oscillations inside\nthe array, resembling the structure of a truncated Bloch\nmode. The defocusing nonlinearity effectively decreases\nthe contrast of the surface waveguide, causing the localized mode to broaden and penetrate substantially into\nthe continuous medium.\nIn order to study in detail the crossover between linear diffraction and nonlinear self-localization, we measure\nthe surface gap soliton formation time as a function of\nthe probe beam power. The results are summarized in\nFig. 2. The formation time increases dramatically for decreasing input power until, below a certain critical power,\nno localized surface mode is observed. The observed critical slowing down indicates the existence of a threshold\npower below which the nonlinear response is too weak\n\n\fLocalization time, hours\n\n3\n100\n\n(a)\n\n80\n60\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nBeam power, mW\nFIG. 2: (color online) Measured surface localization time\nvs. probe beam power.

The value of the threshold power\nwas estimated as Pth = 0.042 mW by modelling the dynamics of the soliton formation time, fitting the function A + B/(P \u2212 Pth ) (Fig. 2, solid curve) to the experimental data (Fig. 2, red dots). Figures 2(a-c) show the\nbeam intensity profiles corresponding to the indicated\ndata points. The width of the localized mode decreases\nfor increasing beam power, spanning about three lattice\nsites immediately above threshold [see Fig. 2(a)], and approximately a single lattice site at higher power, as indicated in Fig. 2(c). The decrease of the beam width is\ndue to the fact that stronger beam self-action at higher\npower leads to a deeper surface defect, and hence more\npronounced beam localization.\nAn essential and unique feature of the observed surface\n\ngap solitons is the staggered phase structure of the beam\ntail inside the periodic medium. The alternating phase of\nthe field lobes reflects the fact that the propagation constant of the self-localized mode lies within the photonic\nbandgap at the edge of the first Brillouin zone. To verify\nthat this is indeed the case in the experiment, we interfere the output beam with a vertically inclined plane reference wave. Figure 3(a) depicts a three-dimensional representation of the spatial beam intensity distribution of\nthe broad surface gap soliton observed near the threshold\n[Fig. 2(a)]. Figure 3(b) shows a two-dimensional intensity\nplot of the associated interference pattern. A half-period\nvertical shift of the interference fringes, corresponding to\nan exact \u03c0 phase jump in the horizontal beam direction,\nis clearly observed between each pair of lobes in the structure [Fig. 3(b)]. The phase is seen to be constant in the\ncontinuous region. The staggered phase structure inside\nthe array and the plane phase in the continuum are signatures of the two different localization mechanisms in\nplay [11]. The mode is confined from the continuum by\ntotal internal reflection, while Bragg reflection is responsible for localization inside the periodic structure.\nIn order to get a deeper insight into the physics of\nstaggered surface soliton formation in semi-infinite lattices with defocusing nonlinearity, we consider the system of coupled-mode equations [15] for the normalized\nmode amplitudes E0 and En (n = 1, 2, . . .), assuming\nweak coupling between the neighboring waveguides,\ndE0\n+ E1 + F (E0 )E0 = 0,\ndz\ndEn\n+ (En+1 + En\u22121 ) + F (En )En = 0,\ni\ndz\n\ni\n\n(1)\n\nwhere F (E) = \u03b3/(1 + |E|2 ) accounts for the saturable\ncharacter of the photovoltaic nonlinearity [16]. For a defocusing nonlinearity, \u03b3 > 0.\nLooking for stationary solutions in the form En (z) =\nexp(i\u03b2z)En , we obtain the linear spectrum of extended\nmodes, \u03b2 = 2 cos k, (0 \u2264 k \u2264 \u03c0). No localized surface mode exists in the linear regime, as this would require large index contrast between the waveguides and\nthe continuum. However, the presence of defocusing\nnonlinearity in the model (1) can give rise to localized\nstates. To find them we solve numerically the corresponding stationary equations by a multi-dimensional NewtonRaphson scheme. Since we are interested in surface localized modes, we look for states with maxima near the\nsurface which decay quickly away from the edge of the\narray, similar to the earlier studied cases of Kerr nonlinearity for the discrete [9] and continuous [11] models.\nFigure 4(a) shows the staggered surface mode calculated by use of the discrete nonlinear model (1) and multiplied by the waveguide mode-field profiles. Using the\nresults solely based on the discrete model (1) provides\na reasonable agreement with the experimental data.

Black dot in (b) refers\nto the stationary solution shown in Fig. 4(a).\n\nthe width of the localized surface state calculated numerically (solid curve) and measured experimentally (diamonds) as a function of the beam power.\nDespite being approximate, the discrete model can be\nemployed to reveal an important physical mechanism of\nthe nonlinearity-induced surface mode stabilization. To\nthis end we follow earlier studies [17, 18]\nP and calculate\n\u2217\n+\nthe effective energy of the mode, H = \u2212 n {(En En+1\n\u2217\n2\nEn En+1 ) + \u03b3 ln(1 + |EnP\n| )}, as a function of its P\ncollective\n2\ncoordinate X = P \u22121 n n|En |2 , where P =\nn |En |\nis the mode power. We apply a constraint method and\nstart from the solution centered at the site n = 0 for\ngiven values of \u03b2 and P . Our goal is to obtain all intermediate solutions between the neighboring stationary\nconfigurations for the same power. First, we calculate the\nstationary mode centered at n = 0 and obtain all {En }\nand the power P ; then we fix the amplitude at the site\nn = 1 to E1 + \u01eb, and solve the Newton-Raphson equations for all remaining Em (m 6= 1) with the constraint\nthat the power be kept at P , arriving at an intermediate\nstate centered between n = 0 and n = 1. Finally we vary\n\u01eb and repeat the procedure until reaching the even configuration where X = 0.5. The procedure is repeated for\nthe solutions centered at n = 1, 2, 3 which allows us to\nconstruct the effective potential plotted in Figs. 5(a,b).\nFigures 5(a,b) show the effective potential of the sur-\n\nface mode in a semi-infinite array, Ueff (X) \u2261 \u2212H(X),\ncalculated for two different power values. The extremal\npoints of this curve defined by the condition dH/dX = 0\ncorrespond to stationary localized solutions. In comparison with an infinite array, the truncation of the waveguide array introduces an effective repulsive surface potential, which is combined with the periodic potential of\nthe array. As a result, discrete surface modes are possible neither in the linear regime nor in the continuous\nlimit. As we see from Fig. 5(a), for low powers there\nexists no solution of the equation dH/dX = 0 at the surface site n = 0, and the surface repels the input beam\nas clearly observed in experiment [see Fig. 1(a,b)]. However, when the input power exceeds the threshold value,\ndiscreteness overcomes the surface repulsive force and the\nlocalized state at n = 0 in the form of the surface gap\nsoliton becomes possible [Fig. 5(b)].\nIn conclusion, we have predicted theoretically and\ndemonstrated experimentally that gap solitons can be\nstabilized near the surface of a periodic medium with\nself-defocusing nonlinearity in the form of staggered surface modes, providing the first experimental evidence of\na nonlinear analog of surface Tamm states in optics.\nThe authors thank A.A.
