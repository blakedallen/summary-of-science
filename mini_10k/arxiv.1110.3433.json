In 1935 Uehling [5] has produced the following formula for the interaction potential between two electric charges (Qe and e) which contains an additional term\nresponsible for the electric polarisation of the vacuum\n\n\u221a\n\u0011 \u03be2 \u2212 1 i\n\u0010\n2\u03b1 Z +\u221e\n1\nQ\nQe h\n1+\n*\nexp(\u22122\u03b1\u22121 \u03ber) 1 + 2\nd\u03be = + U(r)\n\u03c6(r) =\n2\nr\n3\u03c0 1\n2\u03be\n\u03be\nr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we have used the atomic units h\u0304 = 1, me = 1 and e = 1. Here and henceforth\n\u03b1=\n\ne2\nh\u0304c\n\nis the fine structure constant (\u03b1\u22121 \u2248 137.03599911, see, e.g., [6]). The additional\n\npotential U(r) in Eq.(1) is the Uehling potential which is generated by the lowest order\nradiative correction to the electrodynamic Green's function, or photon Green's function,\nfor short (for more details, see, e.g., [7], [8], [9]). As follows from Eq.(1) in light atoms\nthe Uehling potential differs from zero only for very short atomic distances r \u2264 \u039be , where\n\u039be =\n\nh\u0304\nme c\n\n= \u03b1a0 \u2248 3.861592 * 10\u221211 cm is the Compton wavelength of the electron and a0 is\n\nthe Bohr radius.\nIn numerous books and textbooks on Quantum Electrodynamics (see, e.g., [7], [8]) one\ncan find a statement that the integral in Eq.(1) 'cannot be evaluated in closed form but is\neasily solved numerically'. In other words, it is widely assumed that the analytical expression\nfor the U(r) potential does not exist. In order to show that this statement is incorrect we\nproceed to obtain the closed analytical form for the Uehling potential U(r). First, consider\nthe following integral\nIU (a) =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n1\n\n\u221a\n1 \u0011 \u03be2 \u2212 1\nexp(\u2212a\u03be) 1 + 2\nd\u03be ,\n2\u03be\n\u03be2\n\u0010\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a is some positive numerical parameter. By using the substitution \u03be = cosh x we\nreduce IU to the form\nIU =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u0010\n\nexp(\u2212a cosh x) 1 \u2212\n\n\u0011\n1\n1\n1\n1\ndx = K0 (a) \u2212 Ki2 (a) \u2212 Ki4 (a) ,(3)\n\u2212\n2\n4\n2\n2\n2 cosh x 2 cosh x\n\nwhere K0 (a) is the modified Bessel function of zero order (see, e.g, [10], [11], [12]), i.e.\nK0 (z) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nz 2k\n,\nexp(\u2212z cosh t)dt =\n(\u03c8(k + 1) + ln 2 \u2212 ln z) 2k\n2 (k!)2\nk=0\n\nwhere \u03c8(k) is the Euler psi-function defined by Eq.(8.362) from [10]. The functions Ki2 (z)\nand Ki4 (z) in Eq.(3) are the recursive integrals of the K0 (z) \u2261 K0 (z) function, i.e.\nKi1 (z) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nz\n\nKi0 (z)dz ,\n\nand Kin (z) =\n2\n\nZ\n\nz\n\n\u221e\n\nKin\u22121 (z)dz ,\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere n \u2265 1. By using the relation given by Eq.(11.2.14) from [11] for the recursive integrals\nKin (z) (where n \u2265 0) one can reduce Eq.(3) to the following form\nIU (z) = (1 +\n\nz2\nz\n5 z2\n)K0 (z) \u2212 Ki1 (z) \u2212 ( + )Ki2 (z) .\n12\n12\n6 12\n\n(5)\n\nIn the present case we have z = a = 2br and the explicit formula for Uehling potential\nU(r) = U(2br) takes the form\nU(2br) =\n\ni\n\u0010 b2 r 2\n2\u03b1Q h\u0010\nb2 r 2 \u0011\nbr\n5\u0011\n1+\nK0 (2br) \u2212 Ki1 (2br) \u2212\n+ Ki2 (2br) ,\n3\u03c0r\n3\n6\n3\n6\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the notation Q stands for the electric charge of the nucleus and b = \u03b1\u22121 . Now, Eq.(1)\ntakes the form\n\u0010 2r \u0011io\n\u0010 2r \u0011 \u0010 5\n2\u03b1 h\u0010\nr\nr 2 \u0011 \u0010 2r \u0011\nr2 \u0011\nQn\n1+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n* 1 + 2 K0\nKi1\n+ 2 Ki2\n\u03c6(r) =\nr\n3\u03c0\n3\u03b1\n\u03b1\n6\u03b1\n\u03b1\n6 3\u03b1\n\u03b1\nQ\n= + U(r)\nr\n\n(7)\n\nIn atomic units this potential coincides with the Coulomb interaction energy between the\nnucleus (electric charge is Qe) and the electron e. The potential Eq.(7) includes the lowestorder correction to the vacuum polarisation. As expected in atomic units this expression\ndepends only upon the fine structure constant, i.e. upon the universal constants h\u0304 and c,\nand electric charge e (and Qe). The electron mass me is also included in this formula, since\nthe dimensionles variable r in Eq.(7) is r =\n\nr\na0\n\n=\n\nrme e2\n,\nh\u03042\n\nwhere a0 is the Bohr radius. For\n\nmuonic-helium atoms [13], [14] one needs to replace here r \u2192 r\n\n\u0010\n\nm\u03bc\nme\n\n\u0011\n\n. In this study we do\n\nnot want to discuss the vacuum polarisation in muonic atoms and ions. Note only that the\ngeneralisation of these formulae to the case of two interacting electric charges q1 and q2 is\nobvious and simple (see below).\nBy using the known formulae for the limiting forms of the K0 (2br), Ki1 (2br) and Ki2 (2br)\nfunctions (see, e.g., [10], [11] and [12]) one finds the asymptotics of the Uehling potential\nwhich correspond to the cases when r \u226a \u03b1a0 = \u039be and r \u226b \u03b1a0 = \u039be , respectively. In\nparticular, the short range asymptotic of the \u03c6(r) =\n\nQ\nr\n\n+ U(r) potential, Eq.(7), takes the\n\nform (in atomic units)\n\u03c6(r) |r\u21920\u2243\n\nio\n\u03b1h 5\nQn\n1+\n\u2212 \u2212 2\u03b3 + 2 ln \u03b1 \u2212 2 ln r\nr\n3\u03c0 3\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u2248 0.5772156649 . . . is the Euler constant (see, e.g., [10]) and ln \u03b1 \u2248 \u22124.92024365857.\nThe long-range asymptotics of the potential \u03c6(r), Eq.(7), is (in atomic units)\n5\n\n\u03b12\nQn\n2 o\n1 + \u221a 3 exp(\u2212 r)\n\u03c6(r) |r\u2192\u221e \u2243\nr\n\u03b1\n4 \u03c0r 2\n3\n\n(9)\n\n\fNote that the long-range asymptotics of \u03c6(r) decreases with r exponentially. This is not\ncorrect physically, since the exponential function vanishes at r \u2192 +\u221e very rapidly. In\nreality, such incorrect asymptotics of the interaction potential \u03c6(r) at large distances r are\noverweighted by the lowest order QED correction to the electromagnetic field (E, H), or to\nthe pure electric field E in our case, where H = 0. Such a correction provides the correct\npower-type dependence of the interparticle potential at large disctances. It is directly related\nto the non-linearity of the Maxwell equation for the EM-field [7], [15].\nThe lowest order QED correction to the electric field is described by the Wichmann-Kroll\npotential WK (r) (in atomic units) [15], [16]\nWK (r) = \u2212\n\n2Q3 \u03b17\n225\u03c0r 5\n\n(10)\n\nNote that this potential is not regular at the origin. However, as follows from the Appendix\nof [16] such a singularity is formal, since the quibic equation (see Eq.(7) from [16]) which is\nused in the derivation of WK (r) is nor correct at r = 0. The singularity at r \u2192 0 can be\nremoved with the use of the substitution r \u2192 r +\u03b1 in atomic units, or r \u2192 r +\u03b1a0 in regular\nunits. It removes the singularity of the WK (r) potential at r = 0 and changes its behaviour\nat short interparticle distances r \u2264 \u03b1. However, at such distances the Wichmann-Kroll\ncorrection is not important and its contribution is significantly smaller than contribution\nfrom the Uehling potential. On the other hand, at large distances, e.g., for r \u2265 10\u03b1a0 in light\natoms, the contribution from the Wichmann-Kroll potential plays a leading role. Finally,\nwe can write the correct expression for the Wichmann-Kroll potential WK (r)\n\u03c8(r) = WK (r) = \u2212\n\n2Q3 \u03b17\n225\u03c0(r + \u03b1)5\n\n(11)\n\nThis expression can directly be used in calculations of light atoms and ions.\nIt is clear that the potential WK (r), Eq.(11), is always negative. In general, at r \u2248 a0\nthis potential is very small in its absolute value. However, its overall contribution rapidly\nincreases with the nuclear charge Q. Furthermore, it decreases with the distance r as \u223c r \u22125 ,\ni.e. non-exponentially. It is clear that at large distances the Wichmann-Kroll correction will\nalways exceed the contribution form the Uehling potential U(r), Eq.(7). Finally, we can say\nthat the following interaction potential (in atomic units) of the two point electric charges\nQe and e\n\u03a6(r) =\n\n\u0010 2r \u0011\nr\nQ\nQ 2Q\u03b1 h\u0010\nr 2 \u0011 \u0010 2r \u0011\n\u2212\n+ U(r) + WK (r) = +\n* 1 + 2 K0\nKi1\nr\nr\n3\u03c0r\n3\u03b1\n\u03b1\n6\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n4\n\n\f\u00105\n\n\u2212\n\n6\n\n+\n\n\u0010 2r \u0011i\n2Q3 \u03b17\nr2 \u0011\n\u2212\nKi\n2\n3\u03b12\n\u03b1\n225\u03c0(r + \u03b1)5\n\n(12)\n\nhas the correct asymptotic behaviour both at small and large interparticle distances. In the\ncase of the interaction between two point electric charges q1 e and q2 e we need to replace in\nEq.(12) the factor Q by the product q1 q2 . The potential \u03a6(r12 ) takes the form\n2 \u0011\n\u0010 2r \u0011\n\u0010 2r \u0011\nr12\nr12\nq1 q2 2q1 q2 \u03b1 h\u0010\n12\n12\n\u2212\nK\n+\n*\n1\n+\nKi\n\u03a6(r12 ) =\n0\n1\n2\nr12\n3\u03c0r12\n3\u03b1\n\u03b1\n6\u03b1\n\u03b1\n3 7\n2 \u0011\n\u00105\n\u0010 2r \u0011i\n2(q\nq\n)\n\u03b1\nr12\n1 2\n12\n\u2212 + 2 Ki2\n\u2212\n6 3\u03b1\n\u03b1\n225\u03c0(r12 + \u03b1)5\n\n(13)\n\nwhere r12 is the distance between particles 1 and 2.\nThus, we have derived the closed analytical expression for the Uehling potential which\nrepresents the lowest order vacuum polarisation correction(s) in atomic systems. It is shown\nthat the Uehling potential can be represented as a sum of the modified Bessel function of\nthe zero order K0 (2br) and the two recursive integrals of this function, i.e. the K1 (2br)\nand K2 (2br) functions (see Eq.(6)). Based on this formula for the Uehling potential we\nalso derived the general formula for the interaction between two point electric charges which\nincludes the lowest order QED corrections to the Coulomb potential. Note that our formulae,\nEqs.(12) - (13), provide the correct asymptotic behaviour at arbitrary interparticle distances.\nThe formulae, Eqs.(12) - (13), can directly be used in highly accurate computations of the\ncorrection to the vacuum polarisation for the bound state energies in few-electron atoms and\nions. By using the formula, Eq.(12), one can determine the electric field strength E, i.e. the\nspatial gradient of the \u03a6(r12 ) potential, Eq.(13). Such computations are straightforward, but\nthe Fourier resolution of the corresponding 'electrostatic' field takes a very complex form.\nNote also that for the potential \u03a6(r) given by Eq.(12) the condition \u2206\u03a6(r) = 4\u03c0Q\u03b4(r), where\n\u2206 = \u2207 * \u2207 = div(grad...), is obeyed only approximately (in the lowest order approximation\nupon \u03b1).\nNow, by taking into account our explicit and relatively simple three-term formula, Eq.(6),\nwe can reject a widely spread conclusion that the Uehling potential cannot be represented\nby the closed analytical formula. Moreover, we have found that such a simple analytical\nformula drastically simlifies theoretical analysis of vacuum polarization in light atoms and\nions. In our next study we are planning to discribe the procedure of Coulomb quantisation\nfor the Uehling potential. Note that our numerical algorithms based on Eqs.(12) - (13)\nare very fast and effective for accurate calculations of atomic systems. Briefly, we can say\n5\n\n\fthat the use of this closed analytical formula for the Uehling potential opens a new avenue\nin investigation of the vacuum polarisation in light and heavy atoms and ions and muonic\natoms and ions.\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge the University of Western Ontario for financial support.\nOne of us (AMF) wants to thank Professor Joachim Reinhardt (Frankfurt, Germany) for\nhis help with Eqs.(6) and (7).\n\n[1] P.A.M.
