Indeed, the low-energy electron excitations in graphene are massless Dirac fermions with the\nlinear energy spectrum, \u03b5(k) = ~vF |k|.6\u20139 That makes\ngraphene a condensed-matter playground for the study\nof various relativistic quantum phenomena, such as the\nKlein tunnelling10,11 and the Casimir effect.12\u201314 Up to\nnow, most of graphene-related studies were focused on\nits unusual transport properties, and quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects arising from interaction of electrons\nin graphene with a quantized electromagnetic field were\nneglected.7 This paper is aimed to fill partially this gap\nin the theory. We show that due to the giant Fermi velocity of electrons in graphene, vF \u2248 c/300, QED effects\nare pronounced and can lead to qualitative modifications\nof the spectrum of elementary excitations.\nThe linear energy spectrum of electrons in graphene\ncomes from its specific honeycomb lattice structure which\nmakes the band gap between the valence and conductivity bands to be exactly zero.7 There is the long-standing\nproblem of the opening of the band gap. The appearance of a controllable band gap is required for various\nelectronical and optical applications of graphene.1,15,16\nAside from this, it is interesting from the fundamental\nviewpoint to analyze how massless Dirac fermions can\nacquire a mass. This question is relevant, particularly,\nin the context of the observation of Majorana fermions\nin condensed matter systems.17 Several mechanisms of\nthe band gap opening in monolayer graphene have been\nproposed. Among them are breaking of the symmetry between two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice of\n\ngraphene,18,19 the spin-orbit coupling20 and the manybody interactions leading to the excitonic instability.21,22\nRecently, one of us put forward the proposal of opening the band gap by illuminating graphene with a circularly polarized light.23 In this case the gap in the spectrum of elementary electron excitations appears due to\nthe formation of composite electron-photon states which\nare similar to polaritons in ionic crystals and quantum\nmicrocavities.24\u201327 It should be noted that, within the\nframework of QED, the electron-photon interaction can\nbe observed even if \"real\" photons are absent and electrons interact only with vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic field due to emitting and reabsorbing virtual\nphotons.28 Therefore, one can expect that the photoninduced splitting of valence and conductivity bands in\ngraphene23 will take place due to the vacuum fluctuations\neven in the absence of an external field pumping. This\nQED effect is similar to the well-known Lamb shift in the\natomic physics, i.e., the vacuum-induced splitting of the\nstates 2s1/2 and 2p1/2 of a hydrogen atom with the characteristic splitting energy \u2206 \u2248 4 \u03bceV. The Lamb shift,\ndiscovered experimentally by Lamb and Retherford29 and\ntheoretically explained by Bethe30 more than 60 years\nago, is extremely important for understanding and verification of basic principles of QED. That is why it attracts\nthe undivided attention of the physics community up to\nnow.31\nSince clockwise and counterclockwise polarized photons shift electron levels in graphene in mutually opposite directions,23 the band gap opening needs breaking\nthe symmetry between virtual photons with different circular polarizations. This can be achieved by placing a\ngraphene monolayer inside a planar cavity filled with an\noptically active material (see Fig. 1). As it will be shown\nbelow, in this case the vacuum fluctuations lead to the\nopening of the band gap in graphene even in the absence of an external circularly polarized optical pumping.\n\n\f2\nof a planar microcavity. Generally, electron states in\ngraphene near the Fermi energy are described by the\neight-component wave function which accounts for two\nelementary sublattices of graphene, two electron valleys,\nand two orientations of electron spin.7 In what follows\nintervalley scattering processes and spin-flip effects will\nbe beyond consideration, which reduces the number of\nnecessary components of wavefunction to two.\nThe single-particle Hamiltonian of electron in graphene\ncoupled to the cavity mode reads (see the Appendix A\nfor details of the derivation)\nFIG. 1: (color online) Sketch of the system.

For definiteness, we assume the graphene sheet to\nbe placed in the center of the cavity. In Eqs.

The Pauli vector operator, \u03c3\u0302, acts in the space of two orthogonal electron states,\n|\u00b1i, corresponding to the two sublattices of graphene in\naccordance with the following rules: \u03c3\u0302z |\u00b1i = \u00b1|\u00b1i and\n\u03c3\u0302 \u00b1 |\u2213i = |\u00b1i, where \u03c3\u0302 \u00b1 = (\u03c3\u0302x \u00b1 i\u03c3\u0302y )/2. Thus, it corresponds to the pseudospin of electron.\n\n(4)\n\nEigenstates of the electron Hamiltonian (3) are given\nby the expression7\n\u0011\neikr \u0010 \u2212i\u03b8k /2\n|k, \u00b1i = \u221a\n|+i \u00b1 ei\u03b8k /2 |\u2212i ,\n(5)\ne\n2S\nwhere \u03b8k = arctan(ky /kx ) and the signs \u00b1 correspond to\nelectron states in the conductivity and valence bands of\ngraphene (the upper and lower Dirac cones, respectively).\n(0)\nThe corresponding eigenenergies are \u03b5\u00b1,k = \u00b1~vF |k|.\nThe eigenstates of the photon Hamiltonian (2) can be\nwritten as |N\u00b1,q i, where N\u00b1,q are photon occupations\nnumber for photons with different circular polarizations\n(\u00b1) and wave vectors q. Then eigenstates of the full\nelectron-photon Hamiltonian (1) can be decomposed in\nthe basis of the orthogonal electron-photon states\n|k, \u00b1, N+ , N\u2212 i = |k, \u00b1i \u2297 |N+,q i \u2297 |N\u2212,q0 i\n\n(6)\n\nwith the energies\n(0)\n\n\u03b5k,\u00b1,N+ ,N\u2212 = \u00b1~vF |k| + ~\u03c9+,q N+,q + ~\u03c9\u2212,q0 N\u2212,q0 . (7)\n\n\f3\nIn order to find eigenstates and eigenenergies of the full\nHamiltonian (1), we will use the perturbation theory,\nconsidering the interaction Hamiltonian (4) as a perturbation. To calculate the energy corrections in the lowest\norder of the perturbation, one needs to find the eigene (1) having matrix elements\nvalues of the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix H\n(1)\ne\nHss0 (k) = hk, s, 0, 0|\u0124int |k, s0 , 0, 0i. However, it is easy\nto see that all matrix elements of this type are zero and\none needs to use the second order of the perturbation\ntheory. Physically, we need to account for the following processes: the electron with a wave vector k emits a\nvirtual photon with a momentum q and then reabsorbs\nit. Note, that in such a process the momentum of the\nelectron in the initial state, k, should be equal to its momentum in the final state, but the value of the index s\ncan be changed: the electron can remain in the same\nDirac cone or move from one Dirac cone to another one.\nThe last process becomes efficient around k = 0 point\nwhere the energies of the Dirac cones are close to each\nother, which can lead to the lifting of the degeneracy\nas we show below. Therefore, to calculate the spectrum\nof the Hamiltonian (1), we need to use the perturbation\ntheory for degenerate states.\nLet us briefly remind how the second-order corrections can be accounted for within the framework of perturbation theory for degenerate states (the details can\nbe found, e.g., in Ref. [33]). Imagine that we have\na set of states {m} which are close in energy to each\n(0)\n(0)\nother (this means that the energy distances |\u03b5m \u2212 \u03b5m0 |\nbetween them are comparable or smaller relative to a\ncharacteristic energy of the perturbation).

Going beyond this approximation, one needs to\nperform the summation over all modes n in Eqs. (11)\u2013\n(13). Keeping in mind that photon modes with even\nnumbers n correspond to the zero field intensity in the\ncenter of the cavity and, thus, do not interact with the\ngraphene sheet, one gets the following expression for the\nband gap:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u221e X\nX\ne2\n\u03bb\u03b2\u03bb2\nq02 L2 (1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bb2 )\n,\n\u03b5g =\nln 1 + 2\n2\u03c0\u000f0 L n=0\n1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bb2\n\u03c0 (2n + 1)2\n\n(16)\n\nIt should be stressed that in the absence of an optically active media, the eigenfrequencies of clockwise and\ncounterclockwise circularly polarized photons are equal,\n\u03c9+,q = \u03c9\u2212,q . According to the equation (13), in this case\ne +\u2212 is zero and the band gap (16) vanishes.\nthe term H\n0\nTherefore for the band gap opening one needs to fill the\ncavity by an optically active media which splits modes of\nvirtual photons with different circular polarizations. In\nthis case the photonic dispersions read as\np\n\u03c9\u00b1,q = c\u00b1 q 2 + qz2 ,\n(17)\nwhere qz = \u03c0n/L is the quantized z-component of photon\nwave vector in the cavity, n is the number of photon\nmode, c\u00b1 = c/n\u00b1 are the speeds of light with clockwise\nand counterclockwise circular polarizations, and n\u00b1 are\nthe refractive indices for clockwise and counterclockwise\npolarized light, which are different in the optically active\nmedia, n+ 6= n\u2212 .\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIt is seen that Eq. (18) contains the summation over\nphoton polarizations, \u03bb = \u00b1. As expected, the contributions of clockwise and counterclockwise polarized photons in the band gap (18) have opposite signs and the\nband gap vanishes for \u03b2+ = \u03b2\u2212 and appears only in\nthe presence of an optically active media with \u03b2+ 6= \u03b2\u2212 .\nFor instance, the cavity can be filled with a magnetogyrotropic media based on ferrite garnets which possess\nthe giant difference between the velocities of light with\ndifferent circular polarizations.34 The effect becomes even\nmore pronounced if the cavity is filled with an active media with the circular dichroism.35 In this case one of the\ntwo circularly polarized photon modes in the cavity is\nsuppressed and its contribution to the band gap (18) can\nbe neglected. As a result, the summation over \u03bb in Eq.\n(18) can be omitted, which leads to the drastic increasing\nof the band gap.\nFigure 3(a) shows the dependence of the band gap,\n\u03b5g , on the cavity length, L, for the cavity filled by such\na media with the circular dichroism. In the physically\nrelevant region of the cavity lengths (the white area in\nFig. 3(a)), the band gap calculated in the single-mode\napproximation (n = 1) is of several \u03bceV, which is comparable with the Lamb shift.29 The summation over higher\nmodes increases this value by 1\u20132 orders of magnitude:\nfor 100 modes the value of the band gap increases to 50\u2013\n100 \u03bceV, while the summation over all modes gives value\nof about 200 \u03bceV. However, the summation over infinite\nnumber of modes overestimates the band gap. Indeed,\nif the characteristic photon wavelength, 2\u03c0/qz = 2L/n,\nis comparable to the interatomic distance, the macroscopic description of an optically active media becomes\nirrelevant. Therefore the band gap can be reasonably estimated to be about tens of \u03bceV, that is one order of\nmagnitude bigger than the Lamb shift.29\nThe energy spectrum of massive Dirac fermions in\ngraphene is plotted in Fig. 3(b).

Due to the vacuum fluctuations of\nelectromagnetic field in the cavity, the spectrum of elementary excitations in graphene undergoes qualitative\nchanges. Namely, the valence and conductivity bands of\ngraphene are split at the Dirac points. The value of the\nvacuum-induced band gap can be one order of magnitude\nbigger then the famous Lamb shift in hydrogen atom.\nAcknowledgements.
