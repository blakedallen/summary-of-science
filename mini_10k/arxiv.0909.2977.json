The magnetic\npermittivity at optical frequencies is taken as ( \u03bc ) = 1 . So called magneto-optical parameter\nQ = Q1 \u2212 iQ2 is proportionate to the magnetization is phenomenologically relates magnetism and\noptics. \u03b5 0 in (1) is not dependant on the magnetization, while \u03b5 shows quadratic dependence\nwhat may be neglected, if | Q |= 1 . The reflection coefficient of the non-magnetized environment\nis defined by Maxwell formula \u03b5 \u2248 \u03b5 0 = N 2 where \u03b5 = \u03b51 \u2212 i\u03b5 2 , N = n \u2212 ik and n is the refractive\nindex and k is the index of light absorption. The solution to the Maxwell equations with the\ntensor of the dielectric permittivity of kind (1) at corresponding boundary conditions gives a full\ndescription of linear magneto-optical effects. As a result of the vector value of magnetization of\nM , they distinguish three reflection magneto-optical Kerr effects (Fig. 1). Polar and meridional\neffects can be defined as longitudinal, as magnetization is parallel to the plane of light incidence,\nwhile in case of equatorial or transversal effect, it is perpendicular to it. Rotation of polarization\nplane rotating circularly polarized waves. Ellipticity is the result of changing the reflection\ncoefficients for the same waves. At equatorial Kerr effect, the linear component parallel to the\nplane of light incidence changes in amplitude and phase. Usually, the measurements of optical\nconstants and magneto-optical parameter, included in (1), are accomplished independently\nresulting in a significant divergence of the results. Therefore, their simultaneous measurement in\none experiment is a subject of interest. For this purpose, an ellipsometric method of calculations\nby using the magnetization modulation is proposed. This case may be determined as a magnetooptical modulation ellipsometry. [4] deals with the ellipsometric method to measure the\nparameters of massive ferromagnetics based on the equatorial Kerr effect. The same method is\nconsidered for magnetic films [5].\nMagneto-optical effects\n\n\fIn order to derive ellipsometric relations, we will need an explicit form of the magnetooptical Kerr effects. Under the Snell Law, sin \u03c6 \u2248 sin \u03c6/N ,where \u03c6 and \u03c6 are the angle of light\nincidence and angle of light refraction, respectively. For strongly absorbing ferromagnetics, the\nangle of refraction is little and therefore, an approximation cos \u03c6 \u2248 1 [2, 3] is introduced. We will\nconsider the magneto-optical effects by considering the Snell Law, i.e. without the abovementioned approximation.\n1. Polar Kerr effect (Fig. 1a)\nThe complex polar Kerr effect for p - and s - polarizations is defined as follows\n\n( \u03c7 p ) pol = (\u03b4rp ) pol /rp , \u03c7 spol = \u2212(\u03b4rs ) pol /rs\nwhere\n\nrp = ( N cos \u03c6 \u2212 cos \u03c6 )/( N cos \u03c6 + cos \u03c6 ) ,\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nrs = (cos \u03c6 \u2212 N cos \u03c6 )/(cos \u03c6 + N cos \u03c6 )\nare the Fresnel reflection indices. The changes of the reflection indices of the magnetized\nmedium (\u03b4rp , s ) pol will be [2]\n\n(\u03b4rp ) pol = (\u03b4rs ) pol = \u2212iQN cos \u03c6 cos2 \u03c6 / [( N cos \u03c6 + cos \u03c6 )(cos \u03c6 + N cos \u03c6 )] .\n(4)\nLet us combine the effect of both polarizations by inserting (4) in (2)\n\u03c7 ppol,s = \u2212iQN cos \u03c6 cos2 \u03c6 / [(\u03b5 \u2212 1) cos(\u03c6 \u00b1 \u03c6 )]\n(5)\nwhere the upper sign denotes the p -polarization, and the lower sign denotes the s -polarization\nof light. The effect \u03c7 can be presented as a variable on the complex plane of the light\npolarization modes. Then the angle of rotation of the plane of polarization \u03b1 and angle of\nellipticity \u03b8 can be defined at point \u03c7 of the given complex plane\ntan 2\u03b1 = 2 Re( \u03c7 )/(1\u2212 | \u03c7 |2 ) , sin 2\u03b8 = 2 Im( \u03c7 )/(1+ | \u03c7 |2 ) .\n(6)\nThe sign before the imaginary part \u03c7 indicates the right and left direction of the by pass of the\nellipse of the reflected light. For small values , when | \u03c7 |= 1 , we simply have\n\u03b1 \u2248 Re( \u03c7 ) , \u03b8 = Im ( \u03c7 ) . By applying the Snell Law, the expression (5) can be presented in the\nform convenient for calculations\n\u03c7 ppol,s = \u2212iQ cos \u03c6 (\u03b5 \u2212 sin 2 \u03c6 )/[(\u03b5 \u2212 1)( N cos \u03c6 cos \u03c6 m sin 2 \u03c6 )] .\n(7)\nAt a normal incidence of light \u03c6 = \u03c6 = 0 , the difference between p - and s -polarizations\nabolishes and the effect equals to [2]\n\u03c7 pol = \u2212iQN/(\u03b5 \u2212 1) .\n(8)\n2. Meridional Kerr effect (Fig. 1b)\nIn case of meridional geometry of the effect, the correlations (2) remain valid, and the\nchanges in the reflection indices will equal to\n(\u03b4r ) mer = \u2212iQN cos \u03c6 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 /[( N cos \u03c6 + cos \u03c6 )(cos \u03c6 + N cos \u03c6 )] .\n(9)\nThe meridional effect equals to\n\u03c7 pmer\n(10)\n, s = m iQ sin 2\u03c6 cos \u03c6 / [2(\u03b5 \u2212 1) cos(\u03c6 \u00b1 \u03c6 )]\nor\n2\n\u03c7 pmer\n(11)\n, s = m iQN sin 2\u03c6 cos \u03c6 / [2(\u03b5 \u2212 1)( N cos \u03c6 cos \u03c6 m sin \u03c6 )] .\n3. Equatorial Kerr effect (Fig. 1c)\nThe equatorial or transverse Kerr effect is essentially different from the longitudinal\neffects. In the first approximation by Q , no effect on component s is observed\neqv\n\u03c7 eqv\n/rp , \u03c7 seqv = 0\n(12)\np = (\u03b4rp )\nwhere [3]\n(\u03b4rp ) eqv = \u2212iQ sin 2\u03c6 /( N cos \u03c6 + cos \u03c6 ) 2 .\n(13)\n\n\fThen the amplitude equatorial Kerr effect will equal to\n\u03c7 eqv\n= \u2212iQ\u03b5 sin 2\u03c6 /[\u03b5 (\u03b5 cos2 \u03c6 \u2212 1) + sin 2 \u03c6 ] .\n(14)\np\nUnlike the longitudinal effects, no twisting of the plane of polarization is observed, but the\namplitude is changed and the phase of the reflected p wave is shifted. The directly measured\nrelative light intensity will equal to [3]\n2\n2\n\u03b4 peqv = 2 Re( \u03c7 eqv\n(15)\np ) = 2 sin 2\u03c6 (Q1G \u2212 Q2 H )/(G + H )\nwhere\nG = \u03b5 2 [cos2 \u03c6 \u2212 sin 2 \u03c6/(\u03b5 12 + \u03b5 22 )] ,\n(16)\n2\n2\n2\n2\nH = \u03b5 1[cos \u03c6 + sin \u03c6/(\u03b5 1 + \u03b5 2 )] \u2212 1 .\nIf optical constants are known N = n \u2212 ik , the magneto-optical parameter Q = Q1 \u2212 iQ2 from\nequation (15) can be determined for two angles of the light incidence. Fig. 2 shows the\ndispersion of the equatorial Kerr effect in Ni [6] at the angles of the light incidence of \u03c6 = 70o\nand \u03c6 = 80o , and Fig. 3 shows the values Q1 and Q2 calculated by using these data. In the\ninfrared spectrum \u03bb > 2mkm of Ni , these two equations become linearly dependant and no\nmagneto-optical parameter can be determined. The ellipsometric method implies taking\nmeasurements at one fixed angle of the light incidence and is free from such a deficiency.\nMagneto-optical modulation ellipsometry\nThe principal ellipsometric relationship for a non-magnetized medium is of the following\nform\n(17)\n\u03c1 = tan\u03c8 exp(i\u0394 ) = rp /rs ,\nwhere \u03c8 and \u0394 are the angles measured with an ellipsometer, which can be used to determine\noptical constants n and k , included in the Fresnel indices. If an external impact, e.g. the\nmagnetization reversal causes minor changes in the parameters of (17), such a situation in [7] is\ncalled the modulation ellipsometry. In case of magneto-optical modulation ellipsometry, the\nchanges of \u03c8 , \u0394 , rp and rs can be considered as minor, if the magnetic parameter | Q |= 1 . Then,\n(17) can be presented in the following form\n(18)\ntan (\u03c8 + \u03b4\u03c8 ) exp[i ( \u0394 + \u03b4\u0394 )] = (rp + \u03b4rp )(rs + \u03b4rs ) .\nBy disintegrating (18) into small parameters, or by taking a logarithmic differential in both parts,\nwe will gain\n(19)\n2\u03b4\u03c8/ sin 2\u03c8 + i\u03b4\u0394 = \u03b4rp /rp \u2212 \u03b4rs /rs .\nThe left part of this expression contains the measured angles \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b4\u0394 , and its right part is the\ndifference of the corresponding magneto-optical effects. By equating the real and imaginary\nparts of (19), a magneto-optical parameter Q can be determined. Below, we thoroughly deal\nwith the proposed methods for three geometries of the magneto-optical Kerr effects. By using\nexpression (5) for the polar effect, we gain\n\u03c7 ppol \u2212 \u03c7 spol = \u2212iQ sin 2\u03c6 sin \u03c6 (\u03b5 \u2212 sin 2 \u03c6 )/[\u03b5 (\u03b5 cos2 \u03c6 \u2212 1) + sin 2 \u03c6 ]\n(20)\nand from (10) for the meridional effect\n\u03c7 pmer \u2212 \u03c7 smer = \u2212iQ sin 2\u03c6 cos \u03c6 (\u03b5 \u2212 sin 2 \u03c6 )/[\u03b5 (\u03b5 cos2 \u03c6 \u2212 1) + sin 2 \u03c6 ] .\n\n(21)\n\nNote that neither expression contains the angle of refraction \u03c6 . If the angle of the light\nincidence \u03c6 = p/4 , the difference for the both longitudinal effects is the same\n\n\u03c7 long\n\u2212 \u03c7 slong = \u2212iQ 2 (2\u03b5 \u2212 1)/{2[\u03b5 (\u03b5 \u2212 2) + 1]} .\np\n\n(22)\n\nFor the equatorial effect, in accordance with (12) and (14), we will have\n2(\u03b4\u03c8 ) eqv / sin 2\u03c8 + i (\u03b4\u0394) eqv = \u2212iQ\u03b5 sin 2\u03c6 /[\u03b5 (\u03b5 cos2 \u03c6 \u2212 1) + sin 2 \u03c6 ] .\n(23)\nTherefore, the task of determining the magneto-optical parameter Q comes to the determination\nof n and k , as well as \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b4\u0394 of corresponding magneto-optical effects. We will use a\n\n\fsimple (polarizer-object-analyzer (PSA) circuit of ellipsometry [7]. Let us denote a photodetector\nsignal by J(P, A), where P and A are azimuth angles of the polarizer and analyzer, respectively.\nLet us fix the polarizer angle P = +\u03c0/4 and measure the photo-signals at three angles of the\nanalyzer A = + p/4 , 0 , \u2212 p/4 .\nJ \u00b1 (+\u03c0 /4,\u00b1\u03c0 /4) = Rs (1 \u00b1 sin 2\u03c8 cos \u0394) J 0 (+\u03c0 /4,0) = Rs (1 \u2212 cos 2\u03c8 ) ,\n(24)\nwhere Rs =| rs |2 is the intensity of the reflected light for component s . By excluding Rs from\nthese expressions, the ellipsometric angles can be defined\n(25)\n\u03c8 = 1/2 cos \u22121[1 \u2212 2 J 0 /( J + + J \u2212 )] , \u0394 = cos \u22121[( J + \u2212 J \u2212 )/ sin 2\u03c8 ( J + + J \u2212 )]\nand then, the ellipsometric relation is defined \u03c1 = tan\u03c8 exp (i\u0394 ) . The optical constants can be\ndetermined from one of the two equivalent equations\nN = n \u2212 ik = sin \u03c6[1 + tan 2 \u03c6 (1 \u2212 \u03c1 ) 2 /(1 + \u03c1 ) 2 ]1/2 = tan \u03c6[1 \u2212 4 \u03c1 sin 2 \u03c6/(1 + \u03c1 ) 2 ]1/2 .\n(26)\nThegeneralized formulae of modulation, in particular, of magneto-optical ellipsometry [7] in the\ngiven case have the following form\n\u03b4J/J = \u03b4Rs /Rs + \u03b2\u03b4\u03c8 + \u03b3\u03b4\u0394\n(27)\nwhere \u03b4J/J are the relative signals of a photodetector, \u03b4Rs /Rs is the relative change in the light\nintensity for component s . The coefficients \u03b2 and \u03b3 depend only on ellipsometric angles \u03c8\nand \u0394 . Let us write them out for the same modes of the polarizer and analyzer\n\u03b2 \u00b1 = 2(tan\u03c8 \u00b1 cos \u0394)/(1 \u00b1 sin 2\u03c8 cos \u0394) ,\n(28)\n\u03b3 \u00b1 = m sin 2\u03c8 sin \u0394/(1 \u00b1 sin 2\u03c8 cos \u0394) \u03b2 0 = 4/ sin 2\u03c8 , \u03b3 0 = 0.\nBy denoting \u03b4J/J = S and excluding \u03b4Rs /Rs from three equations (27) (for three modes of the\nanalyzer) we gain \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b4\u0394 for longitudinal (polar or meridional) magneto-optical effects\n(\u03b4\u03c8 ) long = 1/4 tan\u03c8 {[2 S 0 \u2212 ( S + + S \u2212 )] \u2212 ( S + \u2212 S \u2212 ) sin 2\u03c8 cos \u0394} ,\n\n(29)\n\n(\u03b4\u0394)long = 1/4 cot \u0394{[2S0 \u2212 ( S + + S \u2212 )](1 \u2212 tan 2\u03c8 ) +\n\n2(S + \u2212 S \u2212 )[tan\u03c8 cos \u0394 \u2212 1/(sin 2\u03c8 cos \u0394)]} ,\nFor the equatorial geometry of the effect \u03b4Rs /Rs = 0 , we will have\n(\u03b4\u03c8 ) eqv = 1/4 cot\u03c8 [( S + + S \u2212 ) + ( S + \u2212 S \u2212 ) sin 2\u03c8 cos \u0394 ] ,\n\n(30)\n\n(\u03b4\u0394 ) eqv = 1/4 cot \u0394\n\n{( S + + S \u2212 )(cot 2\u03c8 \u2212 1) + 2( S + \u2212 S \u2212 )[cot\u03c8 cos \u0394 \u2212 1/(sin 2\u03c8 cos \u0394)]} .\nTherefore, the plan of measuring the optical constants and magneto-optical parameter can be as\nfollows: at a fixed angle of the light incidence and polarizer azimuth, the photo-signals J \u00b1 , J 0 ,\n\nS \u00b1 and S 0 are measured at a specified wave-length. Then, the ellipsometric angles \u03c8 and \u0394 not\ndepending on the magnetization are defined by the formulae (25), and optical constants n and k\nare determined by (26). The magneto-optical ellipsometric angles \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b4\u0394 for longitudinal\ngeometry are defined by the formulae (29), and by (30) for equatorial geometry. Finally, the real\nand imaginary parts in formula (19) are equated, where (20) or (21) is used for the longitudinal\neffect in the right part and (23) is used for the equatorial effect. The real and imaginary parts Q1\nand Q2 of the magneto-optical parameter are defined from these equations. Fig. 4 show the\ndispersion of the magneto-optical ellipsometric angles \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b4\u0394 for transversal geometries in\nNi by using the data in Fig. 3.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Georgian National Scientific Foundation.\n\nReferences\n\n\f[1] W.
