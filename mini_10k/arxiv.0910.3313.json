The strong vertical confinement of both the\nelectric field and the QW excitons result in a strong and\nby design controllable light-matter interaction. When\nthis MC mode is resonant with the excitonic transitions,\nand when the life time broadening of the MC-photons\n(\u03b3f ) and QW-excitons (\u03b3e ) are smaller than the\nphoton-exciton interaction (\u03a9), the system is under the\nstrong-coupling regime, where coherent Rabi oscillations\nbetween the bare states occur. This regime is evidenced\nby the characteristic anticrossing behavior exhibited by\nthe exciton and the cavity mode when they are brought\ninto resonance. As a consequence, the \"new\" eigenstates\nof the system are strongly mixed exciton-photon states,\ncavity-polaritons.1,2,3,4 These quasi-particles have shown\nto exhibit a large number of interesting properties, most\nof them arising from their inherited bosonic character.\nThis character together with their very small effective\nmass (typically 10\u22124 times smaller than that of the bare\nexcitons) enables processes like the condensation into a\nquantum degenerate Bose-Einstein state5,6 in thermal\n\nequilibrium with the lattice,7 and the boser effect\nor stimulated emission,8,9,10 among other non-linear\nphenomena.11 This made the cavity-polariton systems\nnot only very interesting from the basic fundamental\npoint of view, but also very promising in the field of\ntechnological application in coherent light emitting\ndevices.2,3,4,11,12 Efforts have been devoted incessantly\nto the study of cavity-polaritons experimentally and\ntheoretically during the last fifteen years,2,3,4 since the\nfirst experimental observation.13\nThe process of inelastic light scattering due to vibrations in semiconductors and in microcavities for the\ncase where the energy of the light mode is far from\nthe corresponding one of electronic excitations, is usually very well described by treating the light-matter coupling perturbatively.14,15 In this case the Raman effect\nis mediated by electronic or excitonic states by a second order process in exciton-photon interaction. Instead, in microcavities when the cavity mode is tuned\nnear the QW-exciton energy the perturbative approach\nfails.16,17,18,19,20 The exact treatment of the light-matter\ninteraction, i.e. the cavity exciton-polariton picture, is\nessential and the inelastic process (now mediated by polaritons) must be described by a first order perturbation\ntheory of the polariton-phonon interaction.16,18,21\nSince the Raman process due to optical phonons is a\ncoherent process, it is very sensitive to the damping of\nthe resonant state.16,17,18,19 Resonant Raman scattering\n(RRS) experiments as a function of photon-exciton de-\n\n\f2\ntuning evidence the dependence of the polariton\u2013phonon\nand polariton\u2013external-photon coupling with the mode\nmixing in the process. This is distinctly demonstrated by\nthe maximum in the scattering efficiency near the mode\nanticrossing (zero detuning) and the decreasing efficiency\nwhen the polariton character approaches either the pure\nexciton or pure photon state.18,19 Although existing simplified theoretical models describe the phenomenological\nand qualitative behavior of the experimental results, the\nrelevance of rigorously including polariton dephasing and\ndumping effect has been strongly emphasized.17,19,22\nIn this paper we present detailed RRS experimental\nresults together with a theoretical improvement of the\nexisting models that rigorously takes polariton lifetimes\ninto account. The experiments are performed on II-VI\nsemiconductor based microcavities and consist essentially of two types: the first showing the behavior of the\nRaman intensity as a function of cavity-photon\u2013exciton\ndetuning at exact resonance, and the second showing\nthe behavior of the outgoing scattered process for a fixed\ndetuning, and performing a scan with the excitation\nenergy. Experiments are compared to the developed\ntheory that uses a Green's function approach to include\nthe damping effects and the electron-hole (free-exciton)\nstates in a formal way. Using the matrix elements in\nthe theory as free parameters, the theory describes\naccurately the Raman intensity simultaneously for both\ntypes of experiments. Bare life time broadening are\nobtained from a fitting procedure and the effects of\nthe exciton lifetime in relation to the cavity-polariton\nlifetime are discussed. An important improvement to\nthe previously presented theoretical approaches23,24 to\ndescribe the experimental observations quantitatively is\nobtained in the present work by accounting also for the\nsecond type of experiment, which provides additional severe constrains to the unknown parameters of the theory.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In section II the\nsamples are shortly described and the experiments are\npresented. In section III the Experimental results are\nshown. The theoretical model is introduced in section IV:\na short description of the existing phenomenological approaches is given, and afterwards the model Hamiltonian\nand Green's function approach for the Raman intensity\nare explained. In section V the experimental and calculated results are analyzed and discussed. Finally the\nconclusions of this work are summarized.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nExperiments are all performed on a II-VI semiconductor microcavity. CdTe-based cavities are interesting since excitonic binding energies in CdTe quantum\nwells are much larger (\u223c 25 meV) as compared to GaAs\n(\u223c 10 meV). This is a consequence of a stronger electronhole attraction that makes the excitonic states in this\ncompounds much more stable. In addition, the ionic\n\ncharacter of these compounds leads to a stronger lightmatter coupling and hence to much larger Rabi gaps and\nstronger polaritonic effects compared to the GaAs-based\nstructures. On the other hand Raman efficiency due to\noptical phonons is also larger allowing clearer studies,\nspecially when the Stokes-shifted photon is tuned at near\nresonance to a polaritonic state, where luminescence hinders its observation.\nThe studied cavity was grown (100)-oriented by molecular beam epitaxy, and consists of two distributed Bragg\nreflectors (DBRs) enclosing a \u03bb/2 Cd0.4 Mg0.6 Te spacer.\nThree centered CdTe quantum wells of nominal width\n72 \u00c5 and separated by 69 \u00c5 from each other, are embedded in the spacer. The cavity mirrors consisted of\n15.5 periods of Cd0.4 Mg0.6 Te / Cd0.75 Mg0.25 Te \u03bb/4 layers for the top DBR, and 21 pairs for the DBR at the\nbottom, to balance the effect of the air-substrate asymmetry. The layers were grown in such a way that their\nthickness decreases in one direction (like in a wegde), and\nthe cavity mode can thus be tuned by displacing the position of the laser spot on the sample. Experiments were\nperformed at back-scattering z(x, x\u2032 )z \u2032 geometry, where\nz(z \u2032 ) and x(x\u2032 ) describe the incident(scattered) beam direction and light polarization, respectively.25 Here, x and\nx\u2032 correspond to the (110) direction, z to the (001) epitaxial growth direction, and since the configuration is\nback-scattering, z \u2032 \u2261 z\u0304. A tunable cw Ti:sapphire laser\nwas used as excitation source at near normal incidence,\nwith power . 50 \u03bcW, and focalized to a spot of \u2205 \u223c 50\n\u03bcm. The fixed collection cone normal to the sample surface was \u223c 3o , corresponding to an uncertainty in the\nin-plane wave vector of kk \u2248 4.2 \u00d7 103 cm\u22121 . A liquidHe cryostat was used to set the temperature at 4.5 K. At\nthis temperature, the sample shows a double anticrossing\nof the cavity mode with both the E1H1(1s) (X1s ) and\nthe E1H1(2s) (X2s ) heavy-hole exciton modes. The dispersion of the middle and lower polariton branches (MP\nand LP, respectively), derived from photoluminescence\nexperiments, is displayed in Fig. 1a as function of the\nspot position x (in mm) on the sample. Unfortunately\nno direct observation of the presence of the upper polariton (UP) branch was found with luminescence. Using\na simple three-coupled-mode model, the best fits of the\nexperimental MP and LP branches was obtained for a\nRabi-splitting of \u03a9f \u22121s \u2243 13 meV and \u03a9f \u22122s \u2243 3.5 meV\nbetween the cavity mode and the 1s and 2s excitons, respectively. The dashed and dash-dotted lines correspond\nto the bare (non-interacting) exciton (X1s and X2s ),\nand cavity-photon (f ) dispersions used in the model,\nrespectively.19 The vertical dotted lines indicate the positions of the anticrossings, i.e. the minimal distance between the MP-LP branches and the UP-MP branches.\nThe slight positive slope of the bare exciton dispersions\nis due to the small thickness gradient, that also affects\nthe QW's.\nTwo different and independent Raman experiments\nwere performed observing the inelastic scattered photons\ndue to the Raman allowed CdTe QW longitudinal op-\n\n\f\u03a9f-2s\n\nMP\n\nX1s\n\nLP\n\u03a9f-1s\n2\n\n0.6\n\n|A2s|\n\n0.4\n\n|Af|\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0.0\n2\n\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\n(b)\n0\n\nA1s2s\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nx - spot position [mm]\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Dispersions of the cavity-polariton\nmodes as functions of the spot position on the sample, derived\nfrom photoluminescence.

[18,19]. The second experiment consisted in keeping the detuning fixed\n(i.e. at a fixed spot position), and varying the laser energy at near outgoing resonance, in order to scan the MP\nwith the Stokes-shifted photons. In both cases the spectra were analyzed using a Jobin-Yvon T64000 triple spectrometer in substractive mode, equipped with a liquidN2 -cooled charged-coupled device (CCD).\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nTypical spectra for the RRS experiment (of the first\nkind described in section II), are shown in Fig. 2b, for\ndifferent MP mode energies (i.e., laser spot positions).\nThe Raman peak is highlighted on top of the MP luminescence.

Note the asymmetry of the intensity\nscans labeled as (a) and (c) in Fig. 4 towards lower energies. This might be ascribed to the strong presence of\nthe LP.

Thus this intensity\nscan is more symmetric.\nIn the next section the theoretical background will be\naddressed, the Green's function formalism presented, and\nthe calculation of the Raman intensity within this model\nwill be described.\n\nIV.\n\nTHEORETICAL DESCRIPTION\nA.\n\nThe model\n\nIn a cavity polariton system, only MC confined photons and QW confine excitons with the same in-plane\nwave vector (kk ) are coupled.27 Since the above described\nexperiments are performed in near-backscattering geometry, i.e. z(x\u2032 , x\u2032 )z\u0304, kk is considered to be zero (kk = 0).39\nIn what follows the total wave vector and polarization indices will be suppressed, in order to simplify the notation.\nThe following Hamiltonian, for a given kk , is considered\nto describe the cavity exciton-polariton system:23\nH = Hf + He + Hc + Hmix .\n\n(1)\n\n\f5\nThe first term corresponds to the photonic part of the\nHamiltonian:\nX\nX\nHf = Ef f \u2020 f +\n\u01ebp rp\u2020 rp +\n(Vp rp\u2020 f + H.c.). (2)\np\n\np\n\nHere f \u2020 creates a MC photon, which is hybridized to\na continuum of radiative modes described by creation\noperators rp\u2020 . The effect of the latter is to provide a finite\nlife time (\u03b3f ) to the cavity mode, even in the absence of\nlight-matter interactions.\nSimilarly, the excitonic part of H is described as\nX\nX\nX\n(Viq d\u2020iq ei + H.c.) ,\n\u01ebiq d\u2020iq diq +\nEi e\u2020i ei +\nHe =\ni\n\niq\n\niq\n\n(3)\nwhere e\u2020i creates exciton states that will couple strongly\nto the cavity photon mode. For example e\u20201 creates a 1s\nexciton state of energy E1s . Analogous to the case of the\nMC photon, we assume that each exciton mode mixes\nwith a continuum of bosonic excitations (described by\nthe operators d\u2020ig ), which broadens its spectral density.\nThe effect of this mixing is to introduce a broadening \u03b3ei\nfor the excitons even without interaction with the light.\nThe detailed description of this broadening is beyond the\nscope of this work. Numerous physical mechanisms are\nknown to contribute to the damping of the excitonic wave\nfunction and hereby to the line broadening. Some of\nthem are for example: impurities, defect-scattering, interface roughness, well-width fluctuations, and alloy disorder, which have been demonstrated to be present in this\nkind of II-VI based microcavities.28 Whittaker has shown\nthat the inhomogeneous broadening introduced by disorder can be described accurately introducing an imaginary\npart in the self energy of the exciton Green function.29,30\nAs we show below, He has a similar effect within our theory. Therefore the broadenings \u03b3ei [see Eq. (18)] can be\nregarded as due to lifetime broadening.\nThe third term in Eq. (1) describes the electronic excitations that do not couple strongly to the MC photon\nmode,\nX\nHc =\n(4)\n\u01ebk a\u2020k ak .\nk\n\nThese states include discrete exciton states as well as\nstates of the exciton-continuum (i.e. the continuum of\nelectron-hole excitations). The latter correspond to the\neigenstates of the exciton hydrogen-like Hamiltonian that\nare not bound and have positive internal energy.31,32 The\noperators, which describe this exciton continuum, can be\nwell approximated by a\u2020k = c\u2020k vk , where vk destroys a\nvalence electron with 2D wave vector k and polarization\n\u03c3, and c\u2020k creates an electron in the conduction band with\nthe same k and \u03c3 (so that the total wave vector kk = 0).\nNote that the commutator [ak , a\u2020k ] = vk\u2020 vk \u2212 c\u2020k ck . For\nthe temperatures and laser intensities of the experiments,\nall valence (conduction) states are practically occupied\n\n(unoccupied) and therefore with high accuracy vk\u2020 vk = 1\n(c\u2020k ck = 0). Therefore the operators entering Eq. (4) can\nbe regarded as ordinary bosons.33,34\nThe separation of the bound excitonic states into those\nincluded in He or Hc is in principle arbitrary. In particular, when the width of the weakly bound excitonic states\nnear the bottom of the gap is larger than the separation in energy between two next states, these states can\nbe well described as a continuum, beginning at some en\u2032\nergy EX\n, slightly below the energy of the first excitonic\nc\nstate not included in He . In our specific treatment for\nthe experimentally studied sample, we describe all states\n\u2032\nincluded in Hc as a continuum beginning at EX\n, and inc\nclude the two lowest excitonic states (E1s and E2s ) that\ncouple \"strongly\" to the MC photon in He . For simplic\u2032\nity we take EX\n= E2s .\nc\nFinally, the last term of the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) describes the mixing between light and matter\nX\nX\n(Vi e\u2020i f + H.c.) +\n(Vk a\u2020k f + H.c.). (5)\nHmix =\ni\n\nk\n\nAccording to the quantum theory of radiation, in the\ndipolar approximation Vk is proportional to hkc |p\u03c3 |kv i,\nwhere p\u03c3 is the momentum operator in the direction of\nthe electric field, and |kc i (|kv i) is the wave function\nwhich corresponds to the operator ck (vk ). For simplicity, we are neglecting terms which do not conserve the\nnumber of bosons. They can be included without much\ncomplications, but their effect is small for the energies\nof interest.35\nThe Hamiltonian Eq. (1) is quadratic and can be formally diagonalized by a Bogoliubov transformation to\nthe form\nX\nH=\nE\u03bd p\u2020\u03bd p\u03bd ,\n(6)\n\u03bd\n\nwhere the generalized polariton operators p\u2020\u03bd , are related\nto the creation operators entering Eq. (1) by the linear\ncombination\nX\nA\u03bdj \u03b2j\u2020 .\n(7)\np\u2020\u03bd =\nj\n\n\u03b2j\u2020 stands for any operator entering Eq. (1), and A\u03bdj are\nthe coefficients that give the (detuning dependent) corresponding photonic or excitonic weight of the polariton\nstate \u03bd.\nNote that if only the first terms in Eqs. (2), (3) and\n(5) are kept, the simple standard coupled-mode model\nis obtained.19,22 For instance, the three-coupled-mode\nmodel results, when the MC mode couples strongly only\nto the i = 1s and the i = 2s exciton states, and the\nvalues of the interaction are given by 2 V1 \u2261 \u03a9f \u22121s and\n2 V2 \u2261 \u03a9f \u22122s , as it is the case for the above described\nexperiments.\n\n\f6\nB.\n\nThe Raman intensity\n\nIt has been shown previously,18,19,22,23,24 that the outgoing Raman cross section mediated by cavity polaritons\ncan be calculated by first order perturbation theory as\nI(\u03c9) \u221d Ti Wi\u2192s Ts ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Ti describes the incoming channel, i.e. the conversion of the incident external photon to the initial polariton state inside the sample. For the case of outgoing\nresonance and the scattering geometry used in the experiments, Ti is essentially proportional to the DBR's residual transmission, and can be taken as constant. Wi\u2192s\nis the scattering probability from the initial |ii to the\nfinal |si polariton state per unit of time. Ts describes\nthe transmission of the final polariton states to the final photon state outside the sample, which is detected.\nSince the final polariton state leaves the sample due to\nits photonic part, Ts is essentially the projection of the\npolariton state on the final photon continuum state, and\nis thus proportional to the mediating polaritons photon\nstrength, given by |A\u03bdf |2 .\nWe will center our attention on Wi\u2192s , which actually\ndescribes the inelastic scattering process itself. The transition probability is given by Fermi's golden rule as\nWi\u2192s =\n\n2\u03c0\n|hi|H \u2032 |si|2 \u03c1(\u03c9),\n~\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the initial polariton state is |ii = p\u2020\u03bd \u2032 |0i, the final state is given by |si = p\u2020\u03bd b\u2020 |0i, where b\u2020 creates a\nLO phonon, and H \u2032 is the interaction between polaritons\nand LO phonons (e.g. Fr\u00f6hlich-interaction) through the\nexcitonic part of the former. And \u03c1(\u03c9) stands for the\ndensity of final polariton states and is given by\nX\n\u03c1(\u03c9) =\n\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 E\u03bd ) .\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03bd is the label of the polariton eigenstate such as\nE\u03bd = \u03c9.\nHere we are neglecting the contribution of the electronhole continuum to H \u2032 , and \u03b1 represents the ratio of matrix elements of the exciton-LO phonon interaction between 2s and 1s excitons. Note that if lifetime effects\nare neglected, i.e. if all states but the three\nP polariton\nbranches are left aside, \u03c1\u03bd (\u03c9) is reduced to \u03bd \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212E\u03bd ),\nfor \u03bd = LP , M P , and U P , and the simple three-mode\nmodel for the RRS intensity is recovered.19\nUsing the Lehman representation of the Green's\nfunction33 it can be shown that\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n\u03c1jl (\u03c9) = \u2212\nGjl (\u03c9 + i0+ ) \u2212 Gjl (\u03c9 \u2212 i0\u2212 )\n2\u03c0\n(13)\n= A\u03bdj \u0100\u03bdl \u03c1(\u03c9) ,\nP\n2\nand taking into account that\nj |A\u03bdj | = 1, and that\nP\n\u03c1(\u03c9) = j \u03c1jj (\u03c9), it can be followed by replacing these\nexpressions in Eq. (12), that the desired equation for the\nRaman intensity is given by\nI(\u03c9) \u221d\n\n\u03c1f f [\u03c1e1,e1 + |\u03b1|2 \u03c1e2,e2 + 2Re(\u03b1 \u03c1e2,e1 )]\nP\n.\nj \u03c1jj\n\nIn the denominator we neglect the contribution of the\ncontinuum states, because it is negligible near the resonance condition for the outgoing polariton. Therefore\nthe sum over j includes only the densities of excitons and\nphotons. In particular if only two excitons are involved in\nthe polariton system, we need to calculate only the diagonal Green's functions Gf f (\u03c9), Ge1,e1 (\u03c9), and Ge2,e2 (\u03c9).\nAnd also the crossed Green's function Ge2,e1 (\u03c9). Using\nthe equations of motion we obtain:\nGf f (\u03c9) =\nGe1,e1 (\u03c9) =\n\n\u03bd\n\nSince the Hilbert space defined by (6) and (7) is infinite, it is cumbersome to work with the eigenstates and\neigenenergies. However, we do not need them to obtain the intensity of the Raman scattering process. It\nis enough to use retarded Green's functions, that involve\nthe photon and exciton operators (\u03b2l\u2020 ). These functions\nGjl (\u03c9) = hh\u03b2j ; \u03b2l\u2020 ii\u03c9 can be obtained solving a system of\nequations derived from the equations of motion for the\nGreen's function:\n\u03c9hh\u03b2j ; \u03b2l\u2020 ii\u03c9 = \u03b4jl + hh[\u03b2j , H]; \u03b2l\u2020 ii\u03c9 .\n\n(11)\n\n\u2032\n\nThe polariton-phonon interaction H is proportional\nto the exciton part of the scattered polariton. Thus, for\nthe case of a system where only two exciton states interact strongly with the MC mode, the Raman intensity of\nEq.

These two approximations are\nclearly not valid for the last sum. The last sum in\nEq (17), corresponds to the excitons that do not interact\nstrongly with the MC photons, and to the electron-hole\ncontinuum. This continuum begins at the energy of the\ngap and corresponds to vertical transitions in which the\nlight promotes a valence electron with 2D wave vector kk\nto the conduction band with the same wave vector. In the\neffective-mass approximation, the energy \u01ebk is quadratic\nwith kk and this leads to a constant density of states\nbeginning at the gap.

Using these assumptions and separating Sf\u2032 (\u03c9) in real [r(\u03c9)]\nand imaginary [y(\u03c9)] parts we can write:\nZ\n1\ny(\u01eb)\nSf\u2032 (\u03c9) = r(\u03c9) \u2212 i y(\u03c9), r(\u03c9) =\n,(19)\nd\u01eb\n\u03c0\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u01eb)\ny(\u03c9) = A (\u03c9 \u2212 EXc ) \u0398(\u03c9 \u2212 EXc ),\n(20)\nwhere EXc is the bottom of the electron-hole continuum,\nA is a dimensionless parameter that accounts for the coupling magnitude of the interaction between the MC photon and the continuum of excitations, and \u0398(\u03c9) stands\nfor the Heaviside function (step function). The real part\nr(\u03c9) can be absorbed in a renormalization of the photon\nenergy and is unimportant in what follows. The imaginary part y(\u03c9) is a correction to the photon width for\nenergies above the bottom of the continuum. From the\nformalism outlined above, this is expected to lead to a\ndecrease in the RRS intensity when the energy is above\nthe bottom of the continuum. The expression for y(\u03c9)\naccounts so far only for effects of the exciton-continuum,\nand leads therefore to a discontinuous first derivative of\nthe calculated RRS profile. This discontinuity is overpassed, if the remaining bound exciton states are considered. To account for this infinite number of bound\nstates, which become very dense below the bottom of\nthe continuum, the lower part of y(\u03c9) is replaced by a\nparabolic function that matches (\u03c9 \u2212 EXc ) with a contin\u2032\nuous derivative, starting from zero at the energy (EX\n).\nc\n\u2032\nAt the energy EXc , which corresponds to the bottom of\nthe electronic excitations in Hc , as described in the previous subsections:\n\uf8f1\n\u2032\nif \u03c9 \u2264 EX\n\uf8f4\nc\n\uf8f20\n2\n\u2032\n(\u03c9\u2212EXc )\n\u2032\n\u2032\ny(\u03c9) =\n.\nA 4(EXc \u2212E\nif\nE\n\u2264\n\u03c9\n\u2264 2EXc \u2212 EX\n\u2032\nXc\nc\nXc )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u2032\nA (\u03c9 \u2212 EXc ) if \u03c9 \u2265 2EXc \u2212 EXc\n(21)\nAs it will be show in the next section, this refinement in the description of the continuum electron-hole\n\nelectronic excitations and weakly bound excitons does\nnot affect the Raman profile in resonance with the LP\nand MP branches, and only affects the resonant profile\n\u2032\non the UP branch for energies above EX\n, leading to\nc\nsmoother curves.\nThe Raman intensity I(\u03c9) for a fixed detuning is given\nby Eq. (14), together with Eqs. (13), (15)\u2013(18),(21) and\nits dependence with detuning (or equivalently with the\nspot position) enters through the corresponding variation of the bare MC photon (Ef ) and exciton (Eei ) energies. In the next section we will discuss this model, and\ncompare the results to the above presented experimental\ndata.\n\nV.\n\nANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe role of the cavity polaritons as intermediate states\nin the scattering process is fully displayed in the resonant enhancement of the Raman intensity as function\nof exciton-photon detuning, as described in Sec. III and\nshown in Fig. 2. Here the intensity of the scattered resonant Raman signal tuned to a polariton mode (the MP in\nthis case) is followed continuously as this mode changes\nits character from very excitonic (1s-type) to photonic,\nand again very excitonic (2s-type).\nIn a simple picture, since the interaction of the polariton with the LO-phonons is produced through the\nexcitonic part of the polariton, the inelastic scattering\nprocess is favored when the polariton excitonic part is\nlarge. On the other hand the Stokes shifted polariton\nis only detected when the polariton is transmitted outside of the sample. Since this coupling to the photoncontinuum is provided through the photonic part of the\npolariton, the Raman process is favored when this weight\nis also large. Thus in view of these two considerations,\nthe process is optimized when a compromise between\nboth situations is found, and this is reached at zero detuning, i.e. at the crossing of the bare exciton and MC\nphoton, or what is equivalent at the energies where the\ndifferences EMP \u2212 ELP or EUP \u2212 EMP have a minimum.\nThus, within this simplified picture, at these energies the\nRRS efficiency is maximized, and the scattered intensity decreases towards the pure excitonic and photonic\nlimits. As we will see, the inclusion of photon and exciton lifetime broadening, i.e. the coupling of the MC\nphoton to the exciton continuum described in Sec. IV,\nintroduces important modifications to this correct but\nsimplified view.\nFor comparison, the results of calculating the RRS intensity using the simple model given by Eq. (12), considering only three branches (with no lifetime broadening) is shown in Fig. 2c (dashed lines). Two maxima\nare displayed corresponding to the energy of the two\nanticrossings (compare to Fig 2a). This can be understood when the corresponding strength40 components of\nthe MP are analyzed (plotted in Fig 1b). The first an-\n\n\fticrossing (\u223c 2.2 mm) happens at Ef \u2212 E1s = 0 where\n|Af |2 \u2243 |A1s |2 since the 2s strength at this position is\nvery small. The second anticrossing (\u223c 3.4 mm) happens shortly before Ef \u2212 E2s = 0, where the total exciton part equals the photonic part. As explained above\nat these points the compromise is found, and a maximal scattering intensity is expected within this model.\nAs one can see in Fig 2c, this model qualitatively reproduces the general behavior well. However as pointed\nout before18,19 many features are clearly not reproduced\nquantitatively. The first experimental maximum appears\nshifted (\u223c 2 meV) to higher energies, and something similar happens to the second peak, which appears shifted\nto lower energies (\u223c 1 meV) and less intense (shoulder\nlike), as indicated with arrows in Fig. 2c. These observations can be assigned to lifetime or damping effects,19\nand point to the need of the polariton mediated Raman\ntheory described in the previous section (Sec. IV B) that\nincludes rigorously the lifetime broadening into the polariton states. In what follows, our experimental results\nwill be compared to this theoretical model based on a\nGreen's function approach.\nThe Raman intensity, is given by Eq. (14), together\nwith Eqs. (13), (15)\u2013(18). Parameters Ef , E1s , and E2s\nas function of the spot position x, as well as 2 V1s =\n\u03a9f \u22121s and 2 V1s = \u03a9f \u22122s , were derived from the fit of\nthe experimental dispersion shown in Fig 1a, using the\nresult of the three-coupled-mode model as a seed. We\nestimated the bottom of the exciton continuum energy\nat EXc \u2243 1.670 meV. Parameter A is taken as 0.031, derived from the fit to Raman experiments in resonance\nwith the UP on a similar II-VI cavity in the very strong\ncoupling regime.24 The line broadening of the non interacting cavity-photon is estimated by standard realistic reflectivity calculations36,37 to be \u03b3f \u2243 1 meV. The\nexciton line broadening \u03b3e1 , \u03b3e2 , and the 2s\u20131s ratio\nof the exciton-LO phonon interaction matrix elements\ngiven by \u03b1 (assumed as a real number), together with\nthe proportionality factor, are left as fitting parameters.\nBoth types of experiments described in Sec. III (Fig 2c\nand Fig 4) are fitted simultaneously. Summarizing in\na simple interpretation, the first experiment for varying spot position changes the photon-exciton character\nof the mediating polariton. While for the second experiment, the resonance scan at a fixed spot position (fixed\ndetuning), accounts for the total polariton line broadening for that particular exciton-photon mixture. Best fits\nwere obtained for \u03b3e1 = 1.2 meV and \u03b3e2 = 0.9 meV, and\n\u03b1 = \u22120.45. The resulting curves are shown for the RRS\nin Fig. 2c (full line) and for the resonant scans respectively in Fig. 4 (full lines). To fit the latter, only the\nupper half part of the scan has been used for the (b) and\n(c) scans, while for (a) the whole scan has been used. As\ncan be observed the agreement with the measured data is\nvery good, and provides a quantitative description. The\nobtained values for the parameters are relatively robust\nwhether \u03b1, \u03b3e1 or \u03b3e2 are changed.\nSince the 1s- and 2s-exciton weights for the three po-\n\nStokes-shifted energy [eV]\n\n8\n1.67\n1.66\n(b)\n\n1.65\n\n(c) (a)\n\n1.64\n1.63\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nx - spot position [mm]\n\n4\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Contour plot of the total calculated\noutgoing Raman intensity. The LP and UP mode positions\nare indicated with dashed lines, and the MP outgoing resonant condition is plotted with a full curve. The Raman scans\nof Fig 4 are indicated with vertical segments and labeled (a),\n(b), and (c) respectively. The intensity is given in logarithmic\nscale.\n\nsitions [scans (a),(c) and (b)] are different (see Fig.1b),\nsmall changes in these parameters modify the width of\nthe calculated lorentzian-type curves obtained for a fixed\ndetuning, changing consequently also the shape of the\nRRS scan. The simultaneous fit of both independent experiments determines unambiguously the way the values\nthat these parameters can adopt.\nA point that might seem odd at first sight, is the fact\nthat for the calculations \u03b3e1 results slightly larger than\n\u03b3e2 . Nevertheless, this result is to be expected if the\norigin of the broadening is disorder with a correlation\nlength smaller or of the order of the 1s exciton's size:29,30\nthe inhomogeneous broadening is substantially reduced\nby averaging over a volume larger than the length scale of\nthe disorder potential. In fact, this is the reason why the\ndisorder does not affect the broadening of the photons,\nthe wave length of which is much larger than the disorder\ncorrelation length.30\nThe total calculated Raman outgoing intensity is presented in Fig. 5 as a contour plot as function of the spot\nposition (x) and the corresponding Stokes-shifted energy.\nThe mode positions are indicated with dashed lines (LP\nand UP), and the MP outgoing resonant condition is\nplotted with a thick curve. In this figure the Raman\nintensity is shown in a logarithmic scale. The energies\nand x-positions of the Raman scans (shown in Fig. 4)\nare also indicated with vertical segments [marked as (a),\n(b), and (c) respectively], and the corresponding exact\nresonant position with a full circle. As can be seen in\nthis figure the Raman intensity decreases slightly asymmetrically when moving away from the exact MP Raman\noutgoing resonant condition when the Stokes-shifted energy is varied near the position of the first anticrossing,\nwhere the LP and MP modes are closer.

The full curves (LP, MP, and UP) projected on the\nxy-plane of the plot indicate the polariton dispersion of the\npolariton branches. The highlighted resonance profiles on the\nMP, marked as (a), (b), and (c) correspond respectively to\nthe fitted curves in Fig. 4. The bottom panel shows a rotated\ndetail of the UP region of the upper panel.\n\nright direction, but is unfortunately not enough to account for the stronger one observed experimentally for\nRaman profiles (a) and (c). Something similar happens\nat the second anticrossing between the MP and UP, but\nin this case, due to the extremely low resonant outgoing Raman intensity on the UP, the anticrossing is not\nobservable and is \"washed out\".\nThe same calculated total outgoing Raman intensity\nprofile is presented in Fig. 6 as a three-dimensional plot.\nThe mode positions (LP, MP) derived by projecting the\ncorresponding resonance maxima on the xy-plane, are\nshown with dotted curves. For the case of the UP mode,\nas previously mentioned, it was not possible to determine\nthe precise position of the RRS maximum of the UP at\nthe second anticrossing. Thus, for this case, the curve\nshown corresponds to the one derived from the threecoupled-mode model (see Fig. 1a), which differs very little from the one derived by projecting the corresponding\nUP resonance maxima (were the UP resonance maxima\nare clearly distinguishable). The bottom panel of Fig. 6\n\nshows a rotated detail of the UP region. The UP resonant profiles are presented highlighted. Here the upper\nRaman resonant peak is barely seen. For small x, the UP\nappears as a tiny peak that increases slightly its intensity\nwhen approximating the second anticrossing, and merging shoulder like to the resonant profile coming from the\nMP, and increasing its energy after the anticrossing, decreasing its intensity. As can be derived from Fig. 1a, for\nsmall x the UP has a strong excitonic character, which\nis conserved shortly before the second anticrossing. The\nsmall photonic component of the UP at these energies\nis very small (see Fig. 6), and thus the coupling of the\nStokes-shifted polaritons to the continuum of photonic\nstates at the exterior of the cavity is very weak. When the\nposition approaches the second anticrossing the photonexciton mixture of the UP becomes larger, and therefore\nthe Raman intensity increases, reaching a broad maximum slightly after this anticrossing. For increasing energies, the coupling of the electron-hole continuum to this\nmode becomes larger and consequently its life time is\nreduced, the RRS intensity decreases, and the Raman\nprofile becomes significantly broader.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 6, the scattered intensity for\nthe outgoing resonant Raman condition with the UP is\nmore than one order of magnitude smaller as compared to\nthe situation in resonance with the MP. This extremely\nsmall light intensity scattered by the upper branch near\nthe second anticrossing, together with the important intensity loss due to the interaction of the polariton with\nthe exciton continuum (as explained above) are the most\nprobable reasons that hindered the experimental observation of this mode. For completeness, the fitted Raman\nintensity profiles of Fig. 4 are shown on the same plot,\nalso highlighted by thicker lines and respectively indicated as (a), (b), and (c).\nIn our theory, we have not considered the possibility\nof polaritons of a higher branch to be scattered to lower\npolariton states. Since the LP is the lowest excited state\nof the system, the inclusion of this effect would cause an\nimportant increase of the LP resonant outgoing Raman\nintensity, with respect to the resonant scattered intensity\nby the higher order polariton branches (MP, UP). This\nkind of effect has been reported by Tribe et al.17 for a\nIII-V type cavity with build-in electric field. The significantly larger contribution to the total scattered intensity\ncoming from the LP, may explain the asymmetry of the\nobserved Raman scans (see Fig. 4), and would be particularly important at those situations were the LP and the\nMP are nearest, as is the case in for the Raman scans\nlabeled (a) and (c) in the Figs. 4 to 6, i.e. near the first\nanticrossing.\nA study of this processes, as well as detailed calculations of the different contributions to the exciton line\nwidth (supposed here as simple constants), and the careful determination of the exciton-LO phonon matrix elements (here accounted by the constant factor \u03b1), might\nlead to refinements and improvements of the theory.\nHowever, we believe that the formal framework of how\n\n\f10\nthe main physical ingredients enter the polariton mediated Raman process, is well described by the above presented theory.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nSummarizing, we have reported two types of independent Raman experiments in near resonance with the middle cavity-polariton branch of a II-VI based semiconductor optical cavity. The first experiment shows the behavior of the Raman intensity at exact outgoing resonance\nwith the cavity-polariton, for varying photon-exciton detuning. And the second experiment shows the evolution\nfor a fixed photon-exciton detuning, when the Stokesshifted photons are tuned on and off resonance by varying\nthe excitation energy. Both independent experiments are\naccounted simultaneously by the here developed cavitypolariton mediated Raman theory, that rigorously includes photon and exciton damping effects. The presented theory describes quantitatively well the experimental results, a fact that remarks the importance of the\nexciton and cavity-photon lifetime effects in the process\nof inelastic scattering of light due to QW optical phonons.\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nElectronic address: bruchhau@cab.cnea.gov.ar\nAlso at CONICET, Argentina.\nPresent address: DPMC-MaNEP, Universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve,\n24 Quai Ernest Ansermet, 1211 Gen\u00e8ve 4, Switzerland.\nE.
