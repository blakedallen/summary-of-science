The\nfirst one we will refer to is the \"partonic Pomeron\" approach1 . The hard photon\nis here supposed to probe the parton distributions of the Pomeron Regge pole\nconsidered as a hadronic particle. A second approach2 is the Soft Colour Interaction one , where hard diffraction is described by a two-step process: during\na relatively short \"interaction time\", the probe initiates a typical hard deepinelastic interaction. Then, at large times/distances, a soft colour interaction\nis assumed which will decide of the separation between diffractive and nondiffractive events according to a simple probabilistic rule. A third approach is\nbased on the small xBj regime of perturbative QCD, where the resummation\nof leading log 1/xBj leads to the \"QCD dipole\" approach for hard diffraction3 .\nWe show that the three aproaches may find a common formulation. Our\nmain results are the following:\n1) The \"effective\" parameters of the partonic Pomeron are determined\nfrom leading log perturbative QCD resummation. They are found to depend\nnot only on Q2 but also on the ratio \u03b7 = (Y \u2212 y) /y, where Y (resp. y) are the\ntotal (resp. gap) rapidity interval.\n2) The \"effective\" parameters of the hard process before modification by\nthe Soft Colour Interaction are determined. Differences with the original model\navoid the \"Low's theorem\" paradox4.\n3) Using S-Matrix properties of triple-Regge contributions, a relation is\nfound between discontinuities of a 3 \u2192 3 amplitude and the three approaches\nto hard diffraction. In particular, a theoretically founded formulation of a\n(modified) Soft Colour Interaction approach is proposed as a specific double\ndiscontinuity the 3 \u2192 3 forward amplitude.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFrom QCD dipoles to partonic Pomeron\n\nOur starting point5 is the formula for the structure function (inelastic component) for longitudinal and transverse photon:\nZ\n\nDif f\nFT,L\n(Q2 , Y, y) \u223c\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u0012\n\nQ\nQ0\n\n\u00132\u03b3\n\nc+i\u221e\n\nc\u2212i\u221e\n\nd\u03b31 d\u03b32 d\u03b3\n\u03b4(1\u2212\u03b31 \u2212\u03b32 \u2212\u03b3)\n2i\u03c0 2i\u03c0 2i\u03c0\n\nexp {y[\u2206(\u03b31 ) + \u2206(\u03b32 )] + (Y \u2212y) [\u2206(\u03b3)]} ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2206\n\u03b1s Nc\n{2\u03c8(1) \u2212 2\u03c8(\u03b3) \u2212 2\u03c8(1 \u2212 \u03b3)} \u223c \u2206 +\n\u2206(\u03b3) \u2261\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u2212\u03b3\n2\n\n\u00132\n\n(2)\n\nis the BFKL evolution kernel (used in a gaussian approximation), Q0 a nonperturbative scale associated with the proton.

A priori,\nhard/tot\n\nis supposed not to be modified by the soft color interaction. However\nFT,L\na contradiction with \"Low's theorem\" has been quoted4 . Indeed, a fully soft\ncolor interaction can be proven to give no effect on physical obervables.\nIn fact, when inserting the QCD dipole expression (1) in relation (5), one\nfinds5\n\u0012 \u00132\u03b3hard\nexp (Y \u2206(\u03b3hard ))\nQ\nhard/tot\n\u221a\n,\n(6)\nFL,T\n\u223c\nQ0\n2\u03c0\u2206\u2032\u2032 Y\nwhich is very similar with the BFKL expression, except that\n\u0010 \u0011\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nQ\nlog\nQ0\n1\n\uf8f8 6= \u03b3hard = cst \u223c 0.175.\n\u03b3BF KL \u223c \uf8ed1 \u2212 4\n2\n\u2206\u2032\u2032 Y\n\n(7)\n\nThus, in some sense, the Soft Color relations are compatible with QCD\ndipole calculations, but the underlying hard interaction is somewhat different\nthan the assumed mechanism in SCI models. Hence the soft color rearrangement is not simply a \"neutralization\" of color at long distances which would be\nforbidden by virtue of \"Low's theorem\". Apart this modification, formula (5)\nfixes the relative normalization between diffractive and total structure functions. .\n4\n\nS-Matrix interpretation\n\nFollowing old results of S-Matrix theory in the Regge domain6 , and as sketched\nin the figure , one may consider three types of discontinuities of a 3 \u2192 3 amplitude representing hard diffraction. A single discontinuity over the diffractive\nmass2 variable, a double discontinuity taking into account also the analytic\ndiscontinuity in the subenergy of one of the incident Pomeron exchanges and\na triple discontinuity with the discontinuity including the two Pomeron exchanges.\nAs qualitatively shown in the figure, one can associate the three discontinuity formulae with, respectively, the partonic Pomeron, Soft Color Interaction\nand QCD dipole approaches. This is schematically depicted in the \"timedependent\" representation of the figure, where the soft incident Pomerons are\nrepresented as living during a \"long\" time, while the partonic (or QCD dipole)\nprocess are initiated by hard interactions. In fact, one can prove6 the identity of these discontinuities, and thus legitimate the connection realized in the\npreviously mentionned calculations.\n3\n\n\f{\nT=0\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n{\n\np\n\np\n\np\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\nT=0\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n{\n\nT=0\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\np\n\np\n\np\n\np\n\np\n\np\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\np\n\np\n\nFigure 1: \"Time-dependent\" picture of the A(3 \u2192 3) discontinuities.
