However, at energy scales that are now accessible, it is expected (from\nour knowledge of effective field theory) that any fundamentally non-classical effects would be suppressed by at\nleast a factor of the ratio of our experimental energy\nscale to the Planck scale; even for today's most powerful particle colliders, this ratio still gives a suppression\nfactor of 10\u221216 . With no foreseeable way to bridge this\nsixteen-order-of-magnitude gap in energy, we are forced\nto aim for sensitivity rather than power when searching\nfor quantum-gravitational effects.\nOne particularly interesting avenue for this search is\nthe possibility of quantum-suppressed Lorentz violation.\nIn such a scenario, the underlying theory would include\na tensor field (or fields) which spontaneously takes on\na non-zero expectation value. Such a field would, in\nessence, provide a \"preferred\" direction or directions in\nspacetime.1 The background value of this field could then\ncouple weakly to conventional matter fields [2]; thus, the\neffects of such a tensor field could in principle be seen\nvia careful observation of the behaviour of conventional\nparticles and fields.\nA particularly interesting venue in which to search for\npossible violations of Lorentz invariance is the gravita-\n\n\u03b4Gab + Tab cdef \u03b4Rcdef = 8\u03c0G\u03b4Tab\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4Gab and \u03b4Rabcd are (respectively) the Einstein\nand Riemann tensors linearized about a flat background,\n\u03b4Tab is the stress-energy of conventional matter, and\nTab cdef is a \"small\" tensor (in a sense we will make explicit below) depending in a particular way on the background values of the Lorentz-violating tensors. Using\nthis effective equation, they then performed a thorough\npost-Newtonian analysis of such theories, examining the\neffects of Lorentz-violating fields on phenomena including satellite orbits, interferometric gravimetry, torsionbalance experiments, and frame-dragging.2\nWhile this formalism is highly valuable for the analysis of the interface between gravity and Lorentz violation, its range of applicability is not immediately clear.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n1\n\naddress: mdseifer@indiana.edu\nSuch a field is often said to be \"Lorentz-violating\". This description plays somewhat fast and loose with usual notions from the\nrest of physics; the field does, after all, transform as a proper\ntensor field under local Lorentz transformations. A more accurate way to describe such a field would be to say that it\n\"spontaneously breaks Lorentz symmetry\", but such phrasing\nis rather more awkward. In the interests of readability and consistency with other papers in the literature, we will use \"Lorentzviolating\" in this sense as well.\n\ntional sector. Interactions between a dynamical metric\nand a tensor field with a non-zero expectation value have\nbeen postulated as a possible method of modifying cosmology [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], as a mechanism for modifying Newtonian gravity to solve the dark-matter problem [8, 9], or\nsimply in their own right as modifications of conventional\ngravity [10, 11, 12]. Such modifications of gravity will,\nin general, cause modifications to the weak-field limit of\ngravity. The linearized effects of a direct coupling between Lorentz-violating fields and the Riemann tensor\nwere analyzed in some detail by Bailey and Kosteleck\u00fd\n[1]. By making certain assumptions about the properties\nof the equations of motion, they were able to obtain an\neffective linearized gravitational equation of the form\n\n2\n\nIt is important to note that although the Bailey-Kosteleck\u00fd formalism can be applied to the analysis of post-Newtonian gravity,\nthe theories to which this formalism can be applied are in general not the same as those to which Will's familiar Parametrized\nPost-Newtonian (PPN) formalism [13, 14] can be applied. The\nconnections and distinctions between these two formalisms are\nexplored in Section III C of Bailey and Kosteleck\u00fd's original paper [1].\n\n\f2\nTo obtain the effective gravitational equation (1), it was\nnecessary for Bailey and Kosteleck\u00fd to place certain conditions on the equations of motion, rather than on the\naction from which they were derived. As action principles tend to be conceptually simpler than the equations\nof motion derived from them, it would be quite helpful\nto know whether a given action which includes spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking is analyzable in the\nBailey-Kosteleck\u00fd formalism. Should this be the case,\nthe physical predictions of their paper [1] would be directly applicable to any such model.\nThis question is the focus of the present work. We\nwill restrict our attention to the simplest type of tensor\nfield which can spontaneously break Lorentz symmetry,\nnamely vector fields Aa . In Section II, we describe the\nproperties of the theories we will be concerned with, and\nwe review the conditions required for successful use of the\nBailey-Kosteleck\u00fd formalism. Section III is dedicated to\nthe application of these conditions to the vector actions\nunder consideration; we will see that the class of vector\ntheories for which the Bailey-Kosteleck\u00fd formalism can\nsuccessfully be used is not large, but that there do exist\npreviously unconsidered models which can be analyzed\nin this framework. Finally, we discuss these results in\nSection IV.\nWe use the sign conventions of Wald [15] throughout,\nand units in which c = 1.\n\nII.\n\nA.\n\nEQUATIONS OF MOTION AND\nFORMALISM\n\nActions for Lorentz-breaking vector fields\n\nBailey and Kosteleck\u00fd's analysis of gravitational\nLorentz violation [1] begins by assuming an action of the\nform\nZ\n\u221a\nS = d4 x \u2212g (LEH + LLV + L\u2032 ) .\n(2)\nLEH here is the usual Einstein-Hilbert action,\nLEH = R \u2212 2\u039b.\n\n(3)\n\nIn the case of a single vector field being responsible\nfor Lorentz symmetry breaking, we can be more specific\nin the form of the Lagrangian. Denoting the Lorentzbreaking vector field by Aa , the most general Lorentzviolation coupling terms will be of the form\nLLV = \u03be(\u2212fu (A2 )R + fs (A2 )Aa Ab Rab ),\n\nwhere A2 = Aa Aa , fu and fs are arbitrary functions of\nA2 , and \u03be is a coupling constant.3 (By the symmetries\nof the Weyl tensor, any term analogous to tabcd Cabcd and\nconstructed out of Aa and the metric must vanish.) This\nterm is best thought of as a \"weak\" coupling term between the vector field and the curvature; the \"weakness\"\nof this coupling will be of importance in the next subsection.\nThe dynamics for Aa , meanwhile, will be determined\nby L\u2032 . We can write the Lagrangian for an arbitrary\nsecond-differential-order vector theory as\nL\u2032 = K a b c d \u2207a Ab \u2207c Ad \u2212 V (A2 ) + 2\u03baLmat ,\n\n(Eg )ab \u2261 \u2212Gab + \u03beAab + \u03beB ab + (TA )ab + \u03ba(Tmat )ab = 0\n(7)\nand\n(EA )a \u2261 2\u03be(\u2212fu\u2032 Aa R + fs\u2032 Ab Ac Rbc Aa + fs Ab Rba )\n\u0001\n+ Mb c d ea \u2207b Ac \u2207d Ae \u2212 2\u2207b K b a c d \u2207c Ad\n\u03b4Lmat\n\u2212 2V \u2032 Aa +\n= 0, (8)\n\u03b4Aa\nwhere\nAab \u2261 fu Gab + fu\u2032 Aa Ab R\n1\n+ fs g ab Ac Ad Rcd + fs\u2032 Aa Ab Ac Ad Rcd , (9)\n2\n\n(4)\n\nHere, R is the Ricci scalar, (RT )ab \u2261 Rab \u2212 14 gab R is\nthe trace-free Ricci tensor, and Cabcd is the Weyl tensor. The tensors u, sab , and tabcd may be fundamental\nfields or (as will be the case in our analysis) composites\nof other fields present in the theory. The final term, L\u2032 ,\ncontains the terms determining the dynamics of the fundamental Lorentz-violating fields, as well as the action\nfor conventional matter.\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Lmat is the Lagrangian for \"conventional\" matter;\n\u03ba = 8\u03c0G; V (A2 ) is the potential for the vector field, constructed to have a minimum at a non-zero value of Aa ;\nand K a b c d is a tensor constructed out of Aa and the metric. This tensor can be taken to be symmetric under the\nsimultaneous exchange of a \u2194 c and b \u2194 d. The conventional matter action Lmat can, in principle, contain\ndirect couplings to Aa . (We will introduce an explicit\nparametrization for K a b c d in the next subsection.)\nWe can easily obtain the Euler-Lagrange equations associated with this action by varying the action with respect to gab and Aa ; there result the equations\n\nWe will assume throughout that \u039b = 0. The second term,\nLLV , contains the non-trivial couplings of the Lorentzviolating fields to the metric:\nLLV = \u2212uR + sab (RT )ab + tabcd Cabcd .\n\n(5)\n\n1\nB ab \u2261 (g ab \u0003 \u2212 \u2207a \u2207b )fu \u2212 g ab \u2207c \u2207d (fs Ac Ad )\n2\n1\na b\n\u2212 \u0003(fs A A ) + \u2207c \u2207(a (fs Ab) Ac ),\n2\n\n3\n\n(10)\n\nNote that fs is associated with the Ricci tensor in our\nparametrization, while in Bailey & Kosteleck\u00fd's original paper\nthe tensor sab is associated with the trace-free Ricci tensor.\n\n\f3\n(TA )ab \u2261 Mc d e f ab \u2207c Ad \u2207e Af\n\u0011\n\u0010\n+ \u2207e (K c d (a|e| Ab) \u2212 K c d e(a Ab) \u2212 K (ab)c d Ae )\u2207c Ad\n\norder in the coupling constant \u03be, discarding terms\nof O(\u03be 2 ) or higher. Turning this condition around,\nwe will also require that in the limit of vanishing \u03be,\nthe metric will obey the Einstein equations; this ensures that our \"Lorentz-violating\" perturbed metric will only differ slightly from the usual perturbed\nmetric derived from the conventional Einstein equations.\n\n1\n\u2212 g ab V \u2212 Aa Ab V \u2032 , (11)\n2\n\nab\n\n(Tmat )\n\n\u221a\n1 1 \u03b4( \u2212gLmat )\n\u2261 \u221a\n,\n2 \u2212g\n\u03b4gab\n\nMc d e f ab \u2261\n\n1 ab c e\n\u03b4K c d e f\n,\ng K d f+\n2\n\u03b4gab\n\n(12)\n\n3. The fluctuations \u0169, s\u0303ab , and t\u0303abcd of the Lorentzviolating fields do not couple to the \"conventional\nmatter\" sources. This can be ensured by demanding that\n\n(13)\n\nand\nMb c d ea\n\n\u03b4K b c d e\n.\n\u2261\n\u03b4Aa\n\n\u03b4Lmat\n= 0,\n\u03b4Aa\n(14)\n\nthereby eliminating the last term from equation (8)\nabove. In essence, this requirement ensures that it\nis only the metric that is directly affected by the\ndynamical Lorentz breaking. \"Conventional\" test\nparticles will still move on geodesics with respect to\nthe now-distorted metric, and these distorted paths\ncan in principle allow us to indirectly observe the\neffects of Lorentz violation on gravity. In the remainder of this paper, we will be studying \"vacuum\nsolutions\", with all conventional matter sources set\nto zero.\n\n(The arguments of the functions fu , fs , and V will be\nregularly omitted for brevity hereafter.)\nB.\n\nBailey-Kosteleck\u00fd Formalism\n\nThe basic tack taken by Bailey and Kosteleck\u00fd in their\noriginal paper [1] was to start from an action of the form\n(2), with its associated equations of motion; to construct\nthe linearized equations of motion about a particular type\nof background; and to then impose certain conditions on\nthe background and the equations of motion such that the\nlinearized equations could be reduced to a particularly\nsimple form:\n\n4. The independently conserved piece of the Lorentzviolating stress-energy (TA )ab vanishes.\nMore\nspecifically, if we take the divergence of the Einstein\nequation (7), we find that the divergence of (TA )ab\nmust equal the divergence of \u03be(Aab + B ab ). This relation then allows us to \"reverse-engineer\" the form\nof (TA )ab , up to a piece \u03a3ab whose divergence vanishes. This condition is then the statement that\n\u03a3ab itself vanishes.4\n\n\u03b4Gab = \u03ba(\u03b4Tmat )ab + \u016b\u03b4Gab + \u03b7ab s\u0304cd \u03b4Rcd\n1\n\u2212 2s\u0304c (a \u03b4Rb)c + s\u0304ab \u03b4R + s\u0304cd \u03b4Racdb , (15)\n2\nwhere \u016b and s\u0304ab are the background values of the fields\nu and sab . We now review and discuss these conditions\nas they pertain to the vector theories we are considering.\n1. The background values of the Lorentz-violating\nfields are constant with respect to a background flat\nspacetime. In other words, if \u01eb is our linearization\nparameter, we are looking for a family of solutions\nsuch that\ngab = \u03b7ab + \u01ebhab\n\nAa = \u0100a + \u01eb\u00c3a\n\n5. When the Einstein equation (7) is linearized, any\nsecond derivatives of \u00c3a can be eliminated from B ab\nand (TA )ab in favour of second derivatives of the\nmetric. In practise, this elimination can only occur\nvia the linearized vector equation of motion.

As this kinetic term is simply the familiar Maxwell\nfield strength tensor contracted twice with a \"generalized\nmetric\" H1 g ab + H2 Aa Ab , we will call such kinetic terms\n(and theories containing them) \"pseudo-Maxwell.\"\nTaking the divergence of the vector equation of motion\n(8) for a general K a b c d and linearizing about our chosen\nbackground, we find that\n\u03be(\u2212fu\u2032 \u0100a \u2207a \u03b4R + fs\u2032 \u0100b \u0100c \u0100a \u2207a \u03b4Rbc + fs \u0100b \u2207a \u03b4Rba )\n\n\u2212 K bac d \u03b4(\u2207a \u2207b \u2207c Ad ) \u2212 2V \u2032\u2032 (\u01002 )\u0100a \u0100b \u03b4(\u2207a Ab ) = 0\n(30)\nFor an arbitrary vector field Aa and an arbitrary metric,\nwe know that\n\u2207a \u2207b \u2207c Ad = \u2207(a \u2207b) (\u2207c Ad )\n\u0001\n1\nRabc e \u2207e Ad \u2212 Rabe d \u2207c Ae .

It can\nbe shown (see Appendix A) that by taking the appropriate combinations of the derivatives of the equation of\nmotion, we arrive at the equation\nOa b [\u0100c \u03b4(\u2207[b Ac] )] = \u03befs \u0100b \u0100c \u2202[a \u03b4Gb]c\n\n(36)\n\nwhere Oa b is the flat-space linear second-order differential operator\nO a b \u2261 C1 \u03b4 a b \u0003\n\n\u0001\n+ C4 \u03b4a b \u0100c \u0100d \u2202c \u2202d + \u01002 \u2202a \u2202 b \u2212 \u0100a \u0100c \u2202c \u2202 b .\n\n(37)\n\nC1 (C1 + \u01002 C4 ) > 0.\n\n(38)\n\nThus, the operator Oa b applied to the one-form va \u2261\n\u0100 \u03b4(\u2207[a Ab] ) yields a quantity of order \u03be. The properties\nof Oa b (see Appendix A) allow us to conclude that under\nthe imposition of appropriate boundary conditions, the\nquantity va will itself be of order \u03be as long as\nb\n\nSince we also have\n\u0100a \u03b4(\u2207b Aa ) =\n\n1\n\u03b4(\u2207b A2 ) \u223c O(\u03be)\n2\n\n(39)\n\nfrom the massive-mode condition (34) above, we can conclude that under these assumptions, the quantity\n1\n\u0100a \u03b4(\u2207a Ab ) = \u22122vb + \u03b4(\u2207b A2 ) \u223c O(\u03be)\n2\n\nb\n\nwhere \u03b4(A ) = \u03b4(A Aa ) = 2\u00c3 \u0100a + hab \u0100 \u0100 .\nThis implies that in the case where K (ab)c d = 0, if the\nlinearised quantity in brackets above vanishes on some\nhypersurface to which \u0100a is non-tangent, this quantity\nwill vanish throughout spacetime. (Recall that \u0100a is a\nconstant vector field in Minkowski space.) Thus, via an\nappropriate choice of boundary conditions, we can impose\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u2032\n\u03b4F \u2261 \u03be \u2212fu + fs \u03b4R + \u03befs\u2032 \u0100b \u0100c \u03b4Rbc\n2\n\n(40)\n\nas well. This condition, along with the massive-mode\ncondition (34), will become important in our analysis of\nthe effective gravitational equations below.\nIII.\n\nCONDITIONS ON VECTOR DYNAMICS\nA.\n\nThe Einstein limit\n1.\n\nGeneral case\n\n(34)\n\neverywhere.6 This equation can be interpreted as telling\nus how much the vector field moves \"up\" its potential\n\n6\n\n(recall that the value of the potential V only depends on\nA2 ), and so we will call the equation (34) the \"massivemode\" condition. When combined with the linearized\nvector equations of motion (24), this yields\n\nWe have abused notation somewhat here, inasmuch as the quantity \u03b4F defined by (34) is not obtained as the linearized variation of some quantity F . Nevertheless, we will continue to use\n\u03b4F throughout as a reminder that equations involving it are not\nexact, but only hold to linear order.\n\nRecall the second of Bailey and Kosteleck\u00fd's conditions\nabove: namely, that any Lorentz-violating corrections to\nthe linearized Einstein equation are linear in the parameter \u03be. This implies that in the limit \u03be \u2192 0, the equations of motion (21) and (24) must together imply that\nthe conventional linearized Einstein equation is satisfied,\ni.e., that \u03b4Gab = 0. In this limit, the equations of motion\nbecome\n\u2212\u03b4Gab +QK abc d e \u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad )\u2212V \u2032\u2032 \u0100a \u0100b \u03b4(A2 ) = 0, (41)\n\n\f6\nwith QK defined as in (23), and\n\u2212 K b a c d \u03b4(\u2207b \u2207c Ad ) \u2212 V \u2032\u2032 \u0100a \u03b4(A2 ) = 0.\n\n(42)\n\nWe will further allow the functions Ci (A2 ) to be dependent on \u03be, defining functions Ci (A2 ) and Di (A2 ) such\nthat\nCi = Ci + \u03beDi + O(\u03be 2 ).\n\n(43)\n\nFor the two equations (41) and (42) to imply the validity of the conventional linearized Einstein equation, we\nmust be able to eliminate the terms containing second\nderivatives of the vector field from (41) using the vector\nequation of motion (42). Since this must occur for an\narbitrary perturbation of the vector field, with arbitrary\nderivatives, we conclude that this will only occur if for\nsome tensor T abf ,\nQK abc d e = T abf K e f c d\n\n(44)\n\nin the limit \u03be \u2192 0. If this relation holds, then we can\ncombine the linearized Einstein equation and the linearized vector equation of motion to obtain\n\u03b4Gab = \u2212V \u2032\u2032 (\u01002 )(\u0100a \u0100b + T abc \u0100c )\u03b4(A2 ).\n\n(45)\n\nThis further implies that if the conventional Einstein\nequation is to hold in the limit \u03be \u2192 0, we must either\nhave \u0100a \u0100b + T abc \u0100c = 0 or \u03b4(A2 ) = 0 in this limit.\nWhat form must this tensor T abc have? For later convenience, we will split it up into pieces of O(\u03be 0 ) and\nO(\u03be 1 ):\nT abc = T0abc + \u03be T\u0302 abc .\n\n(46)\n\nMoreover, since we are only concerned with the linearized\nequations, we can take T abc to be composed solely of\nbackground quantities. Since the only two geometric objects \"in play\" in the background are the vector field\n\u0100a and the flat metric \u03b7 ab , and given the symmetry\nT abc = T bac inherent in the definition of T abc , we conclude that T abc must be of the form\nT0abc = U1 \u03b7 ab \u0100c + U2 \u0100(a \u03b7 b)c + U3 \u0100a \u0100b \u0100c\n\n(47)\n\nT\u0302 abc = V1 \u03b7 ab \u0100c + V2 \u0100(a \u03b7 b)c + V3 \u0100a \u0100b \u0100c ,\n\n(48)\n\nand\n\nwhere the coefficients Ui and Vi can in principle be functions of \u01002 . Assuming that \u03b4(A2 ) 6= 0, the constraint\nthat \u0100a \u0100b + T0abc \u0100c vanish yields:\n2\n\nU1 = 0 and U2 + U3 \u0100 + 1 = 0.\n\n(49)\n\nK abcd\n\nThe question now becomes what form\ncan have\nand still satisfy the condition (44). As with our other\nquantities, we will split K a b c d into O(\u03be 0 ) and O(\u03be 1 )\nparts:\nK a b c d = (K0 )a b c d + \u03be K\u0302 a b c d + O(\u03be 2 ).\n\n(50)\n\nNote that due to the decomposition (43), (K0 )a b c d or\nK\u0302 a b c d can be obtained by taking the original definition\n(26) of K a b c d and replacing Ci by Ci or Di , respectively.\nSimilarly, we will define\nQK abc d e = (QK0 )abc d e + \u03be Q\u0302K abc d e + O(\u03be 2 ).\n\n(51)\n\nIn the limit \u03be = 0, we thus have the condition\n(QK0 )abc d e = T0abf (K0 )e f c d\n\n(52)\n\nBoth sides of this equation consist of various five-index\ntensors constructed from \u0100a and the metric, with various coefficients given in terms of U2 and the Ci functions.\n(Their exact forms are given in Appendix B, Equations\n(B1) and (B2).) Matching these coefficients, we obtain\na set of eleven equations which the Ci functions and U2\nmust satisfy. (We of course want a non-trivial solution for\nthe Ci coefficients.) Examination of the resulting equations shows that we must have U2 = \u22122 and U3 = \u0100\u22122 ,\nand that the functions Ci must satisfy\nC1 = \u2212C3 = \u2212\u01002 C4 =\n\n1 2\n\u0100 C5 and C7 = 0\n2\n\n(53)\n\nwith C6 and C8 arbitrary. This implies a vector kinetic\nterm that can be rewritten in the form\nK a b c d \u2207a Ab \u2207c Ad\n\n= G1 (g ac \u2212 A\u22122 Aa Ac )(g bd \u2212 A\u22122 Ab Ad )Fab Fcd\n\u0001\n+ G2 g ab + G3 Aa Ab \u2207a (A2 )\u2207b (A2 ) (54)\n\nwhere Fab = 2\u2207[a Ab] and the coefficients Gi are functions\nof A2 , related to the Ci functions by C1 = 2G1 , C6 =\n4G2 \u2212 2A\u22122 G1 , and C8 = 4G3 .\n2.\n\nPseudo-Maxwell dynamics\n\nIn the previous subsection, we assumed that a general form for K a b c d . However, as was noted at the end\nof Section II C, a \"pseudo-Maxwell\" vector kinetic term,\nsatisfying K (ab)c d = 0, will behave somewhat differently.\nThe linearized solutions obtained from such an action\nwill, with the imposition of appropriate boundary conditions, also meet additional self-consistency conditions\ndue to properties of the linearized equations of motion.\nIn particular, in the \u03be \u2192 0 limit, the condition (34) becomes\nV \u2032\u2032 (\u01002 )\u03b4(A2 ) = 0.\n\n(55)\n\nThis allows us to ignore the constraints (49) on T abc ,\nas they were imposed by the requirement that the righthand side of Equation (45) vanish. We therefore only\nhave the requirement that the second derivatives of Aa\nvanish, as expressed by (44), in order to obtain a valid\nEinstein limit. In this case, the full tensors are given by\nEquations (B3) and (B4) in Appendix B. Once again, we\n\n\f7\nperform the matching of coefficients between these two\ntensors, yielding a set of equations that must be satisfied\nby the Ci and Ui functions. Assuming that C1 6= \u2212\u01002 C4 ,\nthese two tensors will be equal if and only if U2 = \u22122 and\nU1 = U3 = 0.7 We have thus found two possible vector\nfield kinetic terms, given by (29) and (54), for which the\nconventional Einstein limit is recovered in the limit of no\ndirect coupling to curvature.\nB.\n\nAdding Lorentz violation\n\nIn the above section, we obtained vector actions which\nsatisfied Condition 2 above; namely, in the limit of no\ndirect coupling to curvature, these actions yielded linearized equations of motion that implied the conventional\nlinearized Einstein equation \u03b4Gab = 0. We now wish to\n\"turn on\" direct coupling between the curvature and the\nvector field by setting \u03be 6= 0 and place further constraints\non the form of these actions.\nAlthough Condition 2 does not yield any constraints\non the form of the equations of motion at O(\u03be), we can\nstill constrain the vector action by imposing Condition\n5: we must be able to eliminate the derivatives of Aa\nfrom the metric equation of motion (21) via use of the\nvector equation of motion (24). In particular, the terms\nin (21) which contain derivatives of the vector field can\nbe written in the form\n(QK abc d e + \u03beQR abc d e )\u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad )\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= (QK0 )abc d e + \u03be(Q\u0302K abc d e + QR abc d e ) \u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad )\n\nmetric equation of motion (21); the antisymmetrized second derivatives will merely result in contractions of \u0100a\nwith the linearized Riemann tensor, which are expected\nif the effective linearized gravitational equation is to be\nof the form (1). This will occur if T\u0302 abc (the O(\u03be) contribution to T abc defined in (46)) satisfies the equation\nQR ab(c d e) + Q\u0302K ab(c d e) = T\u0302 abf K (e f c) d + T0abf K\u0302 (e f c) d .\n(60)\nThis equation is essentially the O(\u03be) analog of Equation\n(44).\nWe can now proceed with the analysis of this equation\nas we did in the \u03be = 0 limit: we write out the left-hand\nand right-hand sides in terms of various five-index tensors constructed from \u03b7 ab and \u0100a , and match coefficients\nto determine the possible forms of the Di 's and their corresponding T abc tensors. Expressions for the resulting\ntensors are given in Appendix B; the left-hand side of\n(60) is given by equation (B5), while the right-hand side\nis given by (B6).\n1.\n\nIn the case where K (ab)c d 6= 0, we found in Section\nIII A 1 that the kinetic terms for the vector must be given\nby (54), with U3 = \u0100\u22122 . We now wish to match the\ncoefficients in (B5) and (B6) to see what conditions can\nbe placed on the Di coefficients and the functions fs and\nfu . Substituting in the appropriate relations for the Ci 's\nand U3 , we find that if (B5) and (B6) are to agree, we\nare forced to set\n\n(56)\n\nUsing the vector equation of motion (21) and the condition (44), we can rewrite this as\n(QK abc d e + \u03beQR abc d e )\u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad )\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2243 \u03be \u2212T0abf K\u0302 e f c d + Q\u0302K abc d e + QR abc d e \u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad )\n\n(57)\n\nwhere the \"\u2243\" symbol here means \"up to terms not involving derivatives of Aa .\" We can further simplify this\nexpression by noting that in an arbitrary spacetime,\n1\n\u2207a \u2207b Ac = \u2207(a \u2207b) Ac \u2212 Rabd c Ad\n2\n\n(58)\n\nor, in our case,\n1\n\u03b4(\u2207a \u2207b Ac ) = \u03b4(\u2207(a \u2207b) Ac ) \u2212 \u03b4Rabd c \u0100d\n2\n\n(59)\n\nup to linear order in \u01eb. Thus, at O(\u03be) we only need to\neliminate the symmetrized second derivatives from the\n\n7\n\nNote that the case where C1 = \u2212\u01002 C4 is a special case of the\nkinetic term (54) derived in the previous section.\n\nGeneral case\n\nfu\u2032 (A2 ) = 0\n\n(61)\n\nfs (A2 ) = 0.\n\n(62)\n\nand\n\nThese conditions can most easily be seen from the coefficients of \u03b7 e(a \u03b7 b)c \u0100d and \u03b7 ab \u0100(c \u03b4 e) d , respectively. In other\nwords, the vector model whose kinetic term is given by\n(54) cannot be modified with a Lorentz-violating curvature coupling of the form (5) and still satisfy the assumptions of the Bailey-Kosteleck\u00fd formalism. (Note that setting fu (A2 ) to a non-zero constant merely changes the effective value of G.) Thus, this theory cannot be successfully be analyzed under this formalism unless Lorentzviolating effects induced by the coupling term LLV vanish.\n2.\n\nPseudo-Maxwell dynamics\n\nThe obvious next step is to attempt the same coefficient matching for pseudo-Maxwell vector theories, as\ndefined in (29). However, when we na\u0131\u0308vely do so, we find\nthat the same logic that forced us to abandon Lorentz violation in the vector model (54) again forces the Lorentzviolating functions fu and fs to vanish in the case of\n\n\f8\npseudo-Maxwell kinetic terms. This stands in opposition\nto the fact Bailey and Kosteleck\u00fd successfully applied\ntheir formalism to the so-called \"bumblebee model\" [2]\nin their original paper [1]; the kinetic term for this model\nis the same as our pseudo-Maxwell kinetic term in the\nspecial case C1 = constant and C4 = 0. What have we\nfailed to take into account?\nThe missing pieces are the conditions on the linearized\nderivatives of Aa derived in Section II C. Namely, we\nfound that under the imposition of certain boundary conditions, we have\na\n\na\n\n\u0100 \u03b4(\u2207a Ab ) \u223c \u0100 \u03b4(\u2207b Aa ) \u223c O(\u03be)\n\n(63)\n\neverywhere in the spacetime. The role of these conditions is easiest to see by returning to Equation (57) and\nexamining the O(\u03be 1 ) derivative terms remaining in the\nequations of motion after eliminating the O(\u03be 0 ) derivative terms. To wit, suppose there exist tensors T\u0302 abf ,\ncabc d , c\u0303abc d , and dabcd such that we can write\n\u2212 T0abf K\u0302 e f c d + Q\u0302K abc d e + QR abc d e\n= T\u0302 abf (K0 )e f c d + cabc d \u0100e + c\u0303abe d \u0100c\n\n+ dabce \u0100d\n\n(64)\n\nThe conditions (63) on the derivatives of Aa imply that\nto linear order in \u01eb, \u0100c \u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad ) and \u0100d \u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad ) are\nof order \u03be; similarly, to this order in \u01eb we will have\n\u0100e \u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad ) = \u0100e \u03b4(\u2207c \u2207e Ad ) + \u0100e \u03b4Rcef d \u0100f\ne\n\nf\n\nd\n\n= \u0100 \u0100 \u03b4Rcef + O(\u03be).\n\n(65)\n\nThus, if Equation (64) holds, we will have\n\n= \u03be(T\u0302\n\n(K0 )e f c d \u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad )\n\n+c\n\nabc\n\ne\n\nd \u0100\n\nf\n\nd\n\n\u0100 Rcef )\n\n+ O(\u03be 2 ),\n\n(66)\n\nsince all the other terms on the right-hand side of (64) are\nof O(\u03be) when contracted with \u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad ).8 In essence,\nthe derivative conditions (63) allow us to \"ignore\" certain\nof the equations arising from the coefficient-matching implicit in (60) at a given order in \u03be.\nTo perform this decomposition, we first note that by\ntaking the equation T0abf (K0 )e f c d = (QK0 )abc d e and replacing the Ci functions with Di functions, we obtain\nT0abf K\u0302 e f c d = Q\u0302K abc d e .\n\n(67)\n\n(To put this another way, the relations (28) hold to all\norders in \u03be, and so T0abf K e f c d = QK abc d e to all orders.)\n\n8\n\nT\u0302 abf K e f c d = V2 C1 (\u0100(a \u03b4 b) d \u03b7 ce \u2212 \u0100(a \u03b7 b)c \u03b4 e d )\n\n+ V1 (C1 + \u01002 C4 )(\u03b7 ab \u03b7 ce \u0100d \u2212 \u03b7 ab \u03b4 e d \u0100c )\n\n+ (V2 C4 + V3 (C1 + \u01002 C4 ))\u0100a \u0100b (\u03b7 ce \u0100d \u2212 \u0100c \u03b4 e d )\n+ V2 C4 (\u0100(a \u03b4 b) d \u0100c \u0100e \u2212 \u0100(a \u03b7 b)c \u0100d \u0100e ).\n\nNote that the decomposition in (64) is ambiguous: it does not\naddress what is to be done with terms of the form C abc \u0100d \u0100e , for\ninstance. However, it is easily seen from (66) that such terms will\nvanish when contracted with the Riemann tensor, so it does not\nmatter whether we consider them to be part of cabc d or dabce .\n\n(68)\n\nComparing these equations, we can then see that Equation (64) is satisfied if T\u0302 abc has\nV2 C1 = \u2212fs ,\nwith V1 and V3 arbitrary, and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\ncabc d = fs \u2212 \u03b7 ab \u03b4 c d + \u03b7 c(a \u03b4 b) d .\n2\n\n(69)\n\n(70)\n\nNote that this latter quantity is independent of the form\nof T\u0302 abf .\nFinally, we confirm that the effective gravitational\nequations are of the proper form for these pseudoMaxwell models. Applying the massive-mode condition\n(34) to the linearized Einstein equation (21), we obtain\nab\n\n\u03b4G\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n1\nab\na b\nab c d\n= \u03be fu \u03b4G \u2212 fs \u0100 \u0100 \u03b4R \u2212 \u03b7 \u0100 \u0100 \u03b4Rcd\n2\n+ (QK abc d e + \u03beQR abc d e )\u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad ).\n\n\u03be(\u2212T0abf K\u0302 e f c d + Q\u0302K abc d e + QR abc d e )\u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad )\nabf\n\nThus, the first two terms on the left-hand side of (64)\ncancel, and we merely need to examine QR abc d e to find\nout the required form of the tensors on the right-hand\nside. The form of QR abc d e is given by (22); for a T\u0302 abf\ngiven by (48), the quantity T\u0302 abf K e f c d is given by\n\n(71)\n\nUsing the linearized vector equation of motion (35) contracted with T0abf = \u22122\u0100(a \u03b7 b)f , we can eliminate the\nO(\u03be 0 ) derivative terms to obtain\n\u0012\n1\n\u03b4Gab = \u03be fu \u03b4Gab + fs \u0100a \u0100b \u03b4R \u2212 2fs \u0100(a \u03b4Rb) c \u0100c\n2\n\u0013\n1\n+ fs \u03b7 ab \u0100c \u0100d \u03b4Rcd + QR abc d e \u03b4(\u2207e \u2207c Ad ) . (72)\n2\nLastly, the remaining derivatives of Aa in the above equation can be eliminated using the derivative conditions, as\nnoted above in equation (66); this yields\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1 a b\n\u0100 \u0100 \u03b4R \u2212 2\u0100(a \u03b4Rb) c \u0100c\n\u03b4Gab = \u03be fu \u03b4Gab + fs\n2\n\u0013\u0013\n.

Plugging in these\nvalues, this effective equation for \u03b4Gab reduces to the\nform of the effective gravitational equation (15) found by\nBailey and Kosteleck\u00fd, with an \"effective \u016b\" of \u2212 34 \u01002\nand with s\u0304ab = \u0100a \u0100b \u2212 41 \u03b7 ab \u01002 .\n\n\f9\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have systematically examined the dynamics of\nvector-tensor gravity theories with spontaneous Lorentz\nsymmetry breaking. The primary constraints on the\nform of these theories were obtained by imposing two\nof Bailey & Kosteleck\u00fd's conditions: First, we required\nthat the equations have the correct weak-field Einstein\nlimit \u03b4Gab = 0 when the Lorentz-violating terms (5) are\n\"turned off\" (Condition 2 of the list in Section II B); second, we required that the linearized stress-energy of the\nvector field vanish automatically when the linearized vector equations of motion held (Condition 5). The first of\nthese requirements led us to the conclusion that the kinetic terms for our vector fields must be of the form (29)\nor (54). The vanishing of the linearized vector stressenergy was found to be a somewhat more subtle issue; we\nfound that under the imposition of appropriate boundary\nconditions, the so-called pseudo-Maxwell vector models\n(those with kinetic terms of the form (29)) could lead to\neffective gravitational equations expressed solely in terms\nof the metric.\nIt is important to reiterate that the imposition of\nboundary conditions is necessary to obtain effective gravitational equations of the form used by Bailey and Kosteleck\u00fd in their post-Newtonian analysis; as was noted at\nthe beginning of Section III B 2, an arbitrary solution of\nthe vector equations of motion will not have the proper\nrelations between the derivatives of the vector field to\ncause the linearized vector stress-energy to vanish. In\na certain sense, this confirms the aptness of the name\n\"bumblebee model\". This name was originally inspired\nby the notion that according to received wisdom, bumblebees should not be able to fly; na\u0131\u0308ve calculations by\nengineers and entomologists in the 1930s seemed to show\nthat the bumblebee's wings were too small to allow it\nto fly, and only once more subtle aerodynamic effects\nwere taken into account was the mystery explained. Similarly, a na\u0131\u0308ve comparison of the bumblebee vector equations of motion with its stress-energy causes us to conclude that we cannot introduce Lorentz-violating gravitational effects into the model; only once more subtle effects (namely, proper boundary conditions) are taken into\naccount can Lorentz violation in the bumblebee model\n\"fly.\"\nThis said, the technique of imposing boundary conditions to obtain the desired effective gravitational equations is not entirely rigourous. In particular, we used\nthe somewhat vague statement that \"solutions depend\ncontinuously on initial data\" to argue that the quantity\n\u0100a \u03b4(\u2207a Ab ) was of order \u03be. While this is true, the notion\nof continuity associated with well-posedness of an initial\nvalue problem is defined in terms of the norms of the solutions on certain Sobolev spaces, and is not easy to gain\na simple intuition about (see Chapter 10 of [15]). The\nnotion of \"continuous dependence on initial data\" (and,\nby Duhamel's principle, on sources) does allow us to say\nthat we can always make \u0100a \u03b4(\u2207a Ab ) as small as we like\n\nby tuning \u03be to be \"sufficiently small\"; however, it is far\nfrom clear how small is \"sufficient.\" It would be instructive to obtain more careful estimates of how critically the\nmagnitude of \u0100a \u03b4(\u2207a Ab ) depends on \u03be; however, such an\nanalysis is well outside the scope of this paper.\nIn some sense, the fact that only pseudo-Maxwell kinetic terms are acceptable for Lorentz violation is not\nentirely surprising given the Bailey-Kosteleck\u00fd formalism's requirement of cancellations in the equations of motion. The quantity \u2207a Ab will, in general, depend both\non derivatives of the vector field and derivatives of the\nmetric (this latter dependence can be thought of as arising from the Christoffel symbols implicit in \u2207a Ab .) A\nvector kinetic term containing an arbitrary contraction\nof \u2207a Ab with itself and other fields will then, in general,\nlead to a \"cross term\" between derivatives of the vector and derivatives of the metric in the kinetic terms of\nthe theory [16]. However, the antisymmetrized derivative\n\u2207[a Ab] is independent of the metric, and so the kinetic\nterms for the metric and the vector will be decoupled\nwhen we contract \u2207[a Ab] with itself. It is therefore not\nsurprising that this special property should have some\nbearing on the relation between the vector equations of\nmotion and the gravitational equations of motion.\nIn the case of C4 = 0 and C1 constant, the pseudoMaxwell theories we have been discussing become a simple Maxwell action for the vector field (albeit without\ngauge symmetry, which is broken by the presence of the\npotential.) However, the theories for which C4 6= 0 do not\nappear to have been previously considered in the literature, at least as far as concerns Lorentz-violating effects.\nIn some sense, the presence of a C4 6= 0 term causes\nLorentz violation for the Lorentz-violating field itself: at\nthe linearized level, small perturbations of the vector field\n\"see\" the effective metric H1 g ab + H2 Aa Ab (as defined in\n(29)), rather than the spacetime metric g ab . In particular, in the bumblebee model the Nambu-Goldstone modes\nof the Lorentz-violating vector field can be interpreted as\na Maxwell field in a particular gauge [17]. If we na\u0131\u0308vely\nextended this interpretation to a general pseudo-Maxwell\ntheory, one would expect that the \"speed of light\" would\nbe different from the \"speed of gravity\", as the two fields\nwould propagate on the null cones of two different metrics. Under such an interpretation the \"photon\" would\nalmost certainly propagate anisotropically; it is also possible that such an interpretation would predict vacuum\nbirefringence. Experimental bounds on such phenomena\ncould then place bounds on the relative values of H1 and\nH2 . That said, this intuitional understanding may be\ncomplicated by the fact that the correspondence in the\nabove-mentioned work [17] is in a non-standard gauge.\nIt is also known that this correspondence does not carry\nover to theories with more general kinetic terms than the\nbumblebee model [18], though the class of models examined in this last work did not include the pseudo-Maxwell\ntheories we have found. More work is needed to elucidate\nthe correspondence (if any) between Maxwell theory and\nthe Nambu-Goldstone modes of these new theories.\n\n\f10\nFinally, it is important to note that our results imply\nthat the Bailey-Kosteleck\u00fd formalism cannot successfully\nanalyze theories with non-standard kinetic terms [4, 5,\n8, 11]. This does not imply that post-Newtonian effects\nin such theories cannot be analyzed; in fact, Bailey and\nKosteleck\u00fd did precisely this in their original paper [1]\nfor a Lagrangian identical to what Carroll et al. later\ncalled sigma-aether theory [4]. It is further possible that\nsuch a theory might in fact provide a viable model of\nLorentz violation, consistent with current experimental\nconstraints, even though it does not fit into the BaileyKosteleck\u00fd formalism. In the absence of a more general\n\nformalism for gravitational Lorentz violation, however,\nsuch theories will have to be analyzed on a case-by-case\nbasis.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank Alan Kosteleck\u00fd for useful discussions leading to this work.

We are thus led to the following question: under\nwhat conditions will the solution for va itself be of order\n\u03be? More precisely, let us pick some time coordinate t\non Minkowski space. We know that if we set \u03be = 0,\nva = 0 for all t is a valid solution of the Cauchy problem\nfor (A4) with the boundary condition va (t0 ) = 0 and\n\u2202va /\u2202t|t0 = 0. We wish to know whether, as we \"tune\"\n\u03be to zero, the solutions of va go \"smoothly\" to zero for\nthese boundary conditions.\nThis is precisely the question of whether the operator\nOa b has a well-posed initial-value formulation.9 While\n\n9\n\nNote that a \"small\" variation in the source terms in (A4) can be\n\n(A3)\n\nthe general problem of whether an arbitrary operator\npossesses an initial-value formulation can be quite subtle,\nfor operators in flat spacetime with constant coefficients\n(such as Oa b ) the situation is more clear-cut. Suppose\nOa b is a linear mth -order differential operator which operates on N -tuples of functions in flat spacetime. (Thus,\nan equation of the form Oa b vb = 0 is a system of N linear\nmth -order differential equations.) Associated with any\nsuch operator we can find an N \u00d7 N polynomial-valued\n~ such that\nmatrix Pa b (\u03bb, \u03b6)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202 ~\nPa b\n, \u2207 = Oa b ,\n(A5)\n\u2202t\n~ we\ni.e., if we take Pa b and replace \u03bb by \u2202/\u2202t and \u03b6~ by \u2207,\nb\nobtain the operator Oa . We will further assume that the\nmatrix Pa b is constant with respect to space and time.\nIt can then be shown [19, 20] that such an operator has\na well-posed initial value formulation (with respect to\nan initial-data surface t = constant) if and only if there\n\nmapped to a \"small\" variation in the boundary conditions via\nDuhamel's principle.\n\n\f11\nexists a real number c such that the mN roots \u03bbi of the\nequation\nh\ni\n~ =0\ndet P (i\u03bb, i\u03b6)\n(A6)\n~ Such an operator\nsatisfy I(\u03bbi ) > \u2212c for all real vectors \u03b6.\nis said to be \"hyperbolic in the sense of G\u00e5rding.\"\nTo apply this result to the case of the operator Oa b , let\nus choose a Cartesian coordinate system on flat spacetime\n{t, x, y, z} for which \u0100x = \u0100y = 0.

Thus, the operator Oa b defined in (37) will be\nhyperbolic in the sense of G\u00e5rding if and only if D is a\n~ i.e., if\npositive definite quadratic form in \u03b6,\n\u00012\nC1 (C1 \u2212 C4 \u0100t ) > 0 and C1 (C1 + C4 \u01002 ) > 0.\n\n(A9)\n\nWe can therefore conclude that in any frame in which\nthese inequalities hold, we can then impose boundary\nconditions on some initial-time surface t = t0 such that\n\u0100b \u03b4(\u2207[a Ab] ) \u223c O(\u03be) throughout the spacetime. We can\nfurther ask that such a frame have At 6= 0; if this is the\ncase, then the massive-mode condition (34) can also be\nimposed on the surface t = t0 , and it will follow (via the\nlinearized equations of motion) that the massive-mode\ncondition is satisfied everywhere. Such a frame will necessarily exist if\nC1 (C1 + \u01002 C4 ) > 0.\n\n(A10)\n\n(If \u01002 < 0, the frame in which \u0100z = 0 satisfies our\nrequirements; if \u01002 \u2265 0, the required frame is one in\nwhich At is non-zero but sufficiently small that C21 >\nC1 C4 (\u0100t )2 .) For \u01002 6= 0, this is equivalent to the condition that the \"effective metric\" appearing in (29) is of\nsignature (\u2212 + + +) or (+ \u2212 \u2212 \u2212).\n\nAPPENDIX B: TENSOR COEFFICIENT-MATCHING\n\nFor a general vector theory, we will have\n(QK0 )abc d e = (C1 \u2212 C3 )\u0100(a \u03b7 b)c \u03b4 e d + (C3 \u2212 C1 )\u0100(a \u03b4 b) d \u03b7 ce \u2212 (C1 + C3 )\u03b4 (a d \u03b7 b)c \u0100e\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n+ C4 \u2212 C5 \u0100a \u0100b \u0100c \u03b4 e d \u2212 2C4 \u0100(a \u03b4 b) d \u0100c \u0100e +\nC5 \u2212 C6 \u0100a \u0100b \u03b7 ce \u0100d\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\u2212 C5 \u0100(a \u03b7 b)c \u0100d \u0100e \u2212 C7 \u0100a \u0100b \u03b4 c d \u0100e \u2212 C7 \u03b7 ab \u0100c \u0100d \u0100e \u2212 C8 \u0100a \u0100b \u0100c \u0100d \u0100e .
