Spectroscopic radial velocities for several nearby open clusters suggest that spectra of (especially earliertype) rapidly rotating stars are systematically blueshifted by 3 km s\u22121 or more, relative to the spectra of slowly\nrotating ones. Comparisons with astrometrically determined radial motions in the Hyades suggests this to be an\nabsolute blueshift, relative to wavelengths naively expected from stellar radial motion and gravitational redshift.\nAnalogous trends are seen also in most other clusters studied (Pleiades, Coma Berenices, Praesepe, \u03b1 Persei, IC\n2391, NGC 6475, IC 4665, NGC 1976 and NGC 2516). Possible mechanisms are discussed, including photospheric\nconvection, stellar pulsation, meridional circulation, and shock-wave propagation, as well as effects caused by\ntemplate mismatch in determining wavelength displacements. For early-type stars, a plausible mechanism is\nshock-wave propagation upward through the photospheric line-forming regions.

Introduction\nWavelength displacements in stellar spectra are affected\nnot only by stellar radial motion causing a Doppler shift,\nbut also by line asymmetries and shifts caused by, e.g.,\natmospheric pulsation, surface convection, stellar winds,\nand gravitational potential. However, for solar-type stars,\nthe net effect of convective blueshifts and gravitational\nredshifts, as predicted from hydrodynamic model atmospheres, does not exceed 1 km s\u22121 (e.g., Dravins 1999).\nFor a few nearby open clusters, it has been possible to\ndetermine accurate radial motions from astrometry only,\nnot invoking spectroscopy. Comparing such astrometric\nradial velocities to spectroscopic data for the Hyades, indicates not only the existence of such convective lineshifts,\nbut also an increasing blueshift of stellar spectra, reaching\n3\u20135 km s\u22121 for rapidly rotating stars earlier than about\nF5 V: Madsen et al. (2002) and Dravins (2003). Since\nthere do not yet exist any detailed hydrodynamic models\nof such earlier-type stellar atmospheres from which synthetic spectral-line shifts could be reliably computed, it is\nnot yet possible to theoretically verify the reality of these\nsuggested trends.\nIn order to examine this effect, we have analyzed spectroscopic data for as large a dataset as possible, using\nSend offprint requests to: S. Madsen, soren@astro.lu.se\n\nthe open-cluster database WEBDA1 . Although its data\nsets are somewhat inhomogeneous, this permits a study\nof relative wavelength displacements for ten clusters, as\nfunction of stellar spectral type and of rotational velocity.\nFive of these clusters have astrometric radial velocities deduced from Hipparcos data (Madsen et al. 2002):\nHyades, Pleiades, Coma Berenices, Praesepe and \u03b1 Persei,\nbut only for the Hyades (and perhaps also Coma) is the\naccuracy adequate to permit studies of not only relative\nbut also absolute wavelength shifts. For stars not measured from Hipparcos, their astrometric radial velocities\nare estimated by assuming they follow the cluster's common space motion.\nSpectroscopic radial velocities for the other five clusters (IC 2391, NGC 6475, IC 4665, NGC 1976 and NGC\n2516) permit studies of relative wavelength shifts relative\nto their mean. This is possible for clusters of small angular\nsize whose stars share the same velocity vector, so that the\nvariation across the sky of the radial motions is negligible\ncompared to the shifts one is searching for.\nAll ten clusters have metallicities close to solar.\nTheir ages range from 13 Myr (NGC 1976) to 660 Myr\n(Praesepe).\n1\n\nAvailable at http://obswww.unige.ch/webda/\n\n\f2\n\nMadsen et al.: Blueshifts in rapidly rotating stars?\n\n2. The 10 clusters\n\nA0\n\nF0\n\nG0\n\nK0\n\nM0\n\nHyades\n\n\u20131\n\nspectr\n\n\u2013 V\n\nastrom\n\n0\n\nV\n\nFig. 1 shows absolute wavelength shifts of stellar spectra\nin the Hyades, plotted as spectroscopic minus astrometric\nradial velocities. A slight trend of a somewhat increased\nblueshift (by about 1 km s\u22121 ) when going from K-type to\nmid-F type stars (B \u2212V from about 1.1 to 0.5) is expected\ndue to the more vigorous convection in F stars, causing\nincreased convective blueshift. However, this trend continues and becomes enhanced for even hotter stars, a region\nwhere not many detailed hydrodynamic models have yet\nbeen developed. Many of these stars are also rapidly rotating, making it difficult to disentangle whether the dependence is upon spectral type or/and on rotation, or perhaps\neven on something else. A similar dependence on rotation\nis suggested also from data for some cool Hyades M-stars:\nFig. 2. The trend seen in the Hyades is also present in\nPraesepe and possibly in Coma Berenices. In \u03b1 Persei the\nsame is seen except for the most rapid rotators (all of\nspectral type B). For the Pleiades, the trend for earlier\nspectral types is at best weak, while its M\u2013stars do show\na clear correlation, noted also by Terndrup et al. (2000);\nsee their Fig. 3. The error bars in Fig. 2 include both the\nstated spectroscopic errors and the part of the astrometric\nerror coming from the internal velocity dispersion in each\ncluster. For detailed discussions on the astrometric error\nbudget, see Lindegren et al. (2000) and Madsen (2003).\nThe rotational broadening of spectral line profiles\nmakes the spectroscopic determination of wavelength shifts\ndifficult in rapidly rotating stars, and even the errors of\nseveral km s\u22121 quoted in the literature may be optimistic.\nTherefore, one should not draw conclusions from individual data points for rapid rotators in, e.g., Fig. 1, but only\nfrom their averages and from the general trends. The statistical scatter may well account for some stars showing\napparent redshifts.\nThe trend of increasing blueshift with higher V sin i\ncan be seen in IC 2391 and NGC 2516, partly in IC 4665,\nmaybe in NGC 1976, but not in NGC 6475 (Fig. 2). In\ncontrast with \u03b1 Persei and maybe the Pleiades, NGC 1976\nand IC 4665, the most blueshifted stars in IC 2391 and\nNGC 2516 happen to be of B-type. It must be noted that\nall these five clusters generally lack mid- and late A stars,\nfor which the trend is well visible in the Hyades. There is\nno apparent correlation between the suggested trends and\ncluster age. For instance, IC 2391 and IC 4665 are coeval\n(45 Myr), while the Pleiades (130 Myr) and NGC 2516\n(110 Myr) have about the same age, but show different\ntrends.\nThe compiled data sets of spectroscopic radial velocities and projected rotational velocities V sin i are quite inhomogeneous, especially for the early spectral types. Since\nthe number of sources is huge, we only give some references to observations or compilations for the interesting\npart of Figs. 1 and 2 (i.e. where V sin i shows a trend towards blueshifted spectra). The Hyades set is a mixture of\nthe compilations by Perryman et al. (1998) and Glebocki\n& Stawikowski (2000), and the observations by Griffin et\n\n[km s ]\n\n5\n\n-5\nGravitational redshift\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nV sin i\n\n10 km s-1\n\nV sin i\n\n100 km s-1\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nB\u2013 V\n\nFig. 1. Wavelength displacements of stellar spectra in\nthe Hyades. Differences between spectroscopically measured radial velocities, and astrometrically determined\nradial motion are plotted as function of both B \u2212 V ,\nand projected rotational velocity V sin i (proportional\nto symbol area). Spectra of rapidly rotating early-type\nstars appear systematically more blueshifted than those\nof slower-rotating later-type ones. Only points with nominal differential velocity errors < 3 km s\u22121 are plotted.\nIn the absence of effects in stellar atmospheres or due\nto spectroscopic techniques, the naively expected spectral\ndisplacements should equal the marked line which estimates the gravitational redshift for main-sequence stars.\nCorresponding spectral types for main-sequence stars are\nmarked at the top.\n\nal.

However,\nstudies of visual-spectroscopic binaries (Pourbaix 2000),\nincluding such with one component being a rapidly rotating A star, have not revealed trends of blueshifts correlated\nwith stellar rotation, but the effect could be hidden in the\nerrors of the estimated binary parameters.\n\n3. Spectrum shifts due to atmospheric dynamics\nAlthough data for different clusters are thus somewhat\nscattered, there still remains the suggestion of a common\ntrend, such that more rapid stellar rotation (and early\nspectral type) correlates with increased spectral blueshift.\nIn this Section, we now look at some plausible mechanisms\nthat might explain such shifts.\n\n3.1. Convection\nConvective blueshifts of spectral lines occur in solar-type\nstars due to the correlation between upward motions of\nphotospheric gas, and their local brightness. Rising and\nblueshifted elements of hot (bright) gas contribute a larger\nnumber of photons than the same gas when it has cooled\noff (is darker) and is sinking (thus redshifted). The effect\nfor the Sun is typically 300\u2013400 m s\u22121 , increasing to about\n\n1 km s\u22121 in hotter F\u2013type stars (Allende Prieto et al.\n2002b).\nThe effects suggested by Figs. 1 and 2, however, are\nof greater magnitude, and are unlikely to be explained by\nconvective blueshifts. This assessment is based on a theoretical grid of 55 two-dimensional hydrodynamic model\natmospheres (Ludwig et al. 1999) for A- to K-type mainsequence stars with solar metallicity. Fig. 3 shows the run\nof the horizontal and vertical component of the convective velocity at Rosseland optical depth unity, as function\nof B \u2212 V . For the conversion from effective temperature\nto color, a semi-empirical relation in Alonso et al. (1996)\nwas used. Some scatter is apparent: the large velocities in\nsix models around B \u2212 V = 0.3 are due to radial oscillations which are not of convective origin, and maximum\nconvective velocities of about 2.2 times solar are found at\nB\u2212V = 0.33 (7000 K). For a given stellar surface contrast,\nthe velocity scaling should be indicative of also the scaling\nfor line shifts. For mid F-type dwarfs some enhancement\noccurs due to an increased granular temperature contrast\nbut even then the convective blueshift would not exceed\nabout 1 km s\u22121 , at least not in the optical wavelength\nregion. Velocities and temperature contrasts quickly drop\ntowards A-type objects, reducing the shifts.\nThe convective blueshift so far discussed is not correlated with stellar rotation. However, a dependence could\n\n\fMadsen et al.: Blueshifts in rapidly rotating stars?\n\narise if rapid rotation would somehow modify the convective flows under the influence of Coriolis and centrifugal\nforces, enhancing the blueshift.\nThe horizontal scale of granulation seems to be proportional to the pressure scale height at optical depth\nunity (Freytag et al. 1997). The velocities of Fig. 3 lead to\nconvective turn-over time scales for A- to G-type dwarfs\nwithin a factor 2 of the solar value (\u2248 10 min). Even\nat rotation rates close to break-up, turn-over time scales\nremain more than one order of magnitude shorter than\nthe rotational period, rendering Coriolis forces rather ineffective for modulating the convective surface structures.\nCentrifugal forces reduce the effective surface gravity, producing more \"giant-like\" conditions. At given effective\ntemperature, lower-gravity models tend to produce larger\nshifts, but observed velocity spans of line bisectors in giants hardly exceed 2 km s\u22121 (Gray & Nagel 1989, Allende\nPrieto et al. 2002a). Since large lineshifts can be expected\nto be accompanied by also large line asymmetries, it appears improbable that lineshifts of 3\u20135 km s\u22121 could be\nproduced by effects of rotation on convection.\n\n3.2. Pulsation\nGas motions where upward velocity correlates with increased brightness may cause blueshifted spectra, irrespective of the scale of the gas flows. Quite a few among\nthe rapidly rotating earlier-type stars showing spectral\nblueshifts reside in the area of the Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram populated by Delta-Scuti-type and similar variables. The sign of the effect appears correct in the sense\nthat maximum outward motion in these pulsating stars occurs near the phase of stellar maximum brightness; thus\nan average over a pulsation cycle should lead to somewhat\nblueshifted lines.\nAlthough the number of [known] pulsating Delta Scuti\nstars in open clusters is not especially great (Antonello\n& Pasinetti Fracassini 1998; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez & Breger 2001),\nseveral are rapidly rotating and might influence our statistical trends. Detailed studies of the radial-velocity and\nline-shape variations have been made for a few largeramplitude Delta Scuti stars (e.g., Dravins et al. 1977; Yang\net al. 1987), but larger pulsational amplitudes are confined\nto the slow rotators (Breger 2000). Since typical amplitudes in Delta Scuti stars are modest (maybe 3 km s\u22121 ),\nand typical photometric amplitudes only some per cent,\nthese appear inadequate for causing a statistical bias of\nthe magnitudes suggested by Figs. 1 and 2.\n\n3.3. Meridional circulation\nWavelength shifts may offer a possibility to study largescale stationary flows across stellar surfaces, such as\nmeridional circulation. In a rotating star, meridional flows\nare generated with \u2013 in the simplest case \u2013 rising motions\nat the poles and sinking at the equator (Sweet 1950).\nThe classical theory predicts very slow motions, occur-\n\n9000\n\nConvective velocity at \u03c4ross=1 [km s\u22121]\n\n4\n\n8000\n\n7000\n\nEffective temperature [K]\n6000\n\n5000\n\n2D hydrodynamic models\nrms horizontal velocity\nrms vertical velocity\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\nB\u2212V\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\nFig. 3. Convective velocities from a grid of 55 mainsequence hydrodynamical model atmospheres (Ludwig\net al. 1999). Shown is the root-mean-square horizontal\n(open) and vertical (solid circles) convective velocity at\nRosseland optical depth unity, as function of B \u2212 V . The\ncorresponding effective-temperature scale is at the top.\n\nring on the Kelvin-Helmholtz time-scale of the star, implying slow flows even in fast rotators. However, the classical theory becomes questionable at the flow boundaries\n(for a discussion see Tassoul 2000) due to divergent solutions towards infinite flow speeds. Hitherto, this problem has not been clarified, not excluding the possibility\nthat meridional flows in the atmosphere could be faster\nthan at first expected. In our case, the measured spectralline displacements originate mainly from the upper stellar\nphotosphere, while the classical theory is about motions\nin stellar interiors. Issues include whether the very much\nlower densities in stellar atmospheres (as compared to the\ninteriors) somehow might cause more rapid flows there (to\nperhaps conserve momentum), whether there are counterrotating \"cells\" near stellar surfaces (Tassoul & Tassoul\n1983; their Fig. 1), or other dynamic issues connected with\nthe relatively thin line-forming layers.\nRelated large-scale flows at the stellar surface are thermally driven \"winds\": rotation leads to gravity darkening, i.e. a non-uniform temperature distribution, with the\nstellar poles hotter than the equatorial regions. A localized heating of an atmosphere was studied by Showman &\nGuillot (2002) in the context of driving (zonal) winds on\nirradiated extra-solar giant planets. They find wind speeds\nup to 2 km s\u22121 for temperature contrasts similar to those\nexpected on rapidly rotating stars.\nThe radial-velocity component of a meridional circulation pattern is much smaller than its tangential component (e.g. Tassoul 2000). The tangential velocity is \u2013 again\nin the simplest case \u2013 directed from the poles towards the\nequator of a rotating star. Such a flow seen equator-on\nwould spectroscopically produce a net blueshift, seen poleon a net redshift. Stars having a large V sin i are likely\nobserved nearly equator-on, and for such stars one would\nexpect blueshifts. However, even if one assumes little can-\n\n\fMadsen et al.: Blueshifts in rapidly rotating stars?\n\n5\n\ncellation by the averaging of the velocity field over the\nvisible stellar hemisphere, the velocities needed to produce the observed lineshifts have to be comparable to\nthe sound speed. Such flow velocities appear difficult to\nsustain under the dissipative influence of shock formation\n(e.g., Landau & Lifschitz 1982).\n\nsidered for explaining the intrinsic blueshifts in rapidly rotating early-type stars. Further observational tests should\ninclude analyses of differential wavelength shifts within\nthe spectra of individual stars, both between their weaker\nand stronger lines, and between the flanks and wings of\nstronger ones.\n\n3.4. Shock-wave propagation\n\n4. Systematic shifts due to template mismatch\n\nDespite the fact that full 3-dimensional hydrodynamic\nmodels with ensuing spectral-line synthesis have not yet\nbeen developed for A-type and hotter stars, various 2dimensional atmospheric models are becoming available.\nOne sequence of such models, at temperatures near the onset of convection, are being developed by Holweger (2003).\nModels for main-sequence A-type stars of 8200 and 9000\nK effective temperatures show that the atmosphere is\nhighly dynamic. It moves up and down in a pulsationlike manner and is traversed by numerous shocks which\npass up through the photosphere at supersonic velocities\nof typically 20\u201330 km s\u22121 . Rising shocks (moving towards\nthe observer) appear blueshifted; they are accompanied\nby density enhancements and plausibly must contribute\nblueshifted spectral-line components. Given their great\namplitudes, it does not seem unreasonable that a statistical bias of the blueshifted profiles could well amount to\nseveral km s\u22121 , the amounts we have been discussing.\nIn the absence of a detailed treatment of line formation in these models, various weighting functions can be\napplied on the vertical velocity field to get an indication of\nlikely wavelength shifts for the spectral lines. By weighting the local vertical velocity field with the local internal\nenergy Ei (a rough proxy for spectral-line excitation), a\ndisplacement is found, mimicking spectral blueshifts of 1\u2013\n2 km s\u22121 (Holweger 2003).\nA further factor is that the corresponding radialvelocity signatures probably become better visible in\nrapidly rotating stars. The wavelength shift of any stellar spectrum is normally determined through a crosscorrelation of the observed spectrum with some spectral\ntemplate, and then the main weight comes from the flanks\nof the sharper stellar spectral lines. For slowly rotating\nstars, many photospheric lines (originating in the lower\natmosphere) contribute to the radial-velocity signal. In\nrapid rotators, however, the spectral broadening causes\nmost weak lines to become very shallow and not contributing much to the radial-velocity signal which is then\nweighted towards the wavelength positions of the flanks\nof the stronger lines (such as the Balmer lines from hydrogen). Those typically originate in the upper photosphere, at those greater atmospheric heights where the\nrising shockwaves have become more fully developed, and\nwhere one could expect their blueshifted contributions to\nbe more significant.\nEven if, obviously, any genuine comparison with theory\nmust eventually include detailed line-profile synthesis, we\nfind this scenario the most plausible among the ones con-\n\nSystematic wavelength shifts could also result from instrumental effects in the process of measuring and deducing radial velocities. Radial-velocity instruments often\nuse a cross correlation template taken from a slowly rotating cooler star. However, for a rapidly rotating hotter\nstar, such a template may have a zero-point mismatch in\nwavelength since the rotational broadening blends different spectral-line groups than those in cooler stars (e.g.,\nMorse et al. 1991; Verschueren et al. 1999; Griffin et al.\n2000).\nEven if effects of this type are present to some degree,\nwe find it unlikely that they could amount to the several\nkm s\u22121 suggested by observations (identified effects rather\nappear to lie on levels of 0.5\u20131 km s\u22121 ).\n\n5. Effects on open-cluster studies\nIrrespective of their cause \u2013 physical or instrumental \u2013\nthe existence of systematic blueshifts in some fraction of\nopen-cluster stars can influence precise studies of cluster\nmembership and dynamics. For stars whose membership\nin a cluster is doubted, a probability of membership is\nnormally computed, taking into account the observed deviation of the star's motion from that of the cluster as a\nwhole. Obviously, if for some groups of stars such measures are systematically shifted due to other effects, these\nstars may erroneously be rejected as cluster members (or\nnon-members included).\nAlso biases may enter for any kind of studies of cluster\ndynamics that are based upon spectroscopic radial velocities. The effects are likely to be greatest for groupings with\nmany rapidly rotating stars, in particular young clusters\nand OB-associations.\n\n6. Conclusions\nAbsolute and relative wavelength shifts permit certain\nstudies of stellar atmospheric dynamics. For some nearby,\nwell-studied open clusters, indications are that rapidly rotating stars (especially those of early spectral types) have\ntheir spectra blueshifted by 3\u20135 km s\u22121 . Having searched\nfor mechanisms that might produce such shifts, we conclude that one plausible candidate appears to be upward\npropagating shock waves, now seen in hydrodynamic simulations of hotter stars. However, other mechanisms cannot\nbe excluded, and will probably be required to explain the\napparently analogous trends seen also for rapidly rotating M-type dwarfs. Irrespective of their causes, such shifts\nmay influence assigned cluster membership for any star,\n\n\f6\n\nMadsen et al.: Blueshifts in rapidly rotating stars?\n\nand affect the deduced cluster dynamics. The phenomenon\nmay also imply that rapidly rotating field stars could have\nunderestimated radial velocities.\nFuture analyses of these phenomena should include, on\nthe observational side, large and homogeneous data sets,\nand also separate wavelength measurements for different\nclasses of spectral lines. On the theoretical side, the primary need is for synthetic spectral line profiles computed\nfrom hydrodynamic model atmospheres.\nAcknowledgements.
