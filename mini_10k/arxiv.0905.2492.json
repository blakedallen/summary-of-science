Introduction\nIn this talk I want to discuss some results related to saturation and\nmultiple collisions obtained in collaboration with Emil Avsar, Christoffer\nFlensburg, and Leif L\u00f6nnblad [1, 2]. In high energy pp collisions the minijet\ncross section is much larger than the total cross section. This implies that\neach event contains on average more than one minijet pair, and multiple\nsubcollisions are an essential feature of high energy hadronic reactions. A\nformulation in transverse coordinate space and the eikonal approximation\nare particularly suited for a treatment of these features, and has been successfully applied to \u03b3 \u2217 p collisions, both for total and diffractive scattering\ncross sections [3, 4].\nThe application of the eikonal formalism is, however, mainly applicable\nfor inclusive observables, and a description of exclusive final states is more\n\u2217\n\nPresented at the Epiphany Conference, Cracow, January 2009\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nepiphany \u0307gg\n\nprinted on June 9, 2018\n\nIntegrated cross section above pTmin for pp at 14 TeV\n10000\njet cross section\ntotal cross section\n1000\n\nsigma (mb)\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\npTmin (GeV)\n\nFig. 1.

At present the most successful model for high\nenergy pp collisions is the Pythia model by Sj\u00f6strand and coworkers [5],\nwhich has been extensively tuned to Tevatron data by R. Field [6].\nThere are, however, a set of problems connected to these tunes. How\ndoes the partonic final state hadronize? A fit to data needs strong colour\nreconnections, for which we have a poor theoretical understanding. Also\nit is difficult to properly include effects of correlations and fluctuations in\nmomentum space cascades.\nIn this talk I want to discuss a new approach based on Mueller's dipole\ncascade model, which is an attempt to combine the good features of formulations in transverse coordinate space and in momentum space.\n2. Minimum bias and underlying events\nIn collinear factorization the inclusive parton scattering cross section\ndiverges like d\u03c3\u0302/dp2\u22a5 \u223c 1/p4\u22a5 for small p\u22a5 . An estimate of the integrated\njet cross section above a cut p\u22a5,min is shown in fig. 1 for pp scattering at 14\nTeV. We here see that for p\u22a5,min < 5 GeV the integrated jet cross section\nexceeds the total cross section, which implies that an average collision must\nhave several hard subcollisions.\nMultiple collisions have also been directly observed in collider experiments. Thus four-jet events with pairwise back-to-back jets have been seen\nby AFS at the ISR, by UA2 at the CERN Spp\u0304S collider, and by CDF at the\nTevatron. At the Tevatron the most clear signal is observed in the analysis\nof 3 jets + a prompt photon [8].\n\n\fepiphany \u0307gg\n\nprinted on June 9, 2018\n\n3\n\nIt was early suggested that the increase in the pp cross section is driven\nby minijet production, and that minimum bias events are dominated by\n(semi)hard parton subcollisions [9]. This is also an essential assumption\nin the Pythia model. This model is also based on collinear factorization,\nwhich implies that a cutoff is needed for the singularity at small p\u22a5 . This\nis motivated by the fact that hadrons are colour neutral, and therefore the\nCoulomb potential must be screened for large impact parameters or small\np\u22a5 . Fits to collider data give a cutoff at around 2 GeV, slowly increasing\nat higher energies. (A similar cutoff is also obtained naturally in the k\u22a5 factorization formalism [10]. In the dipole cascade model the transverse\nmomentum k\u22a5 of a colliding gluon is related to the dipole size in transverse\ncoordinate space, and therefore also to the screening length.)\nFor the more recent version of Pythia this cutoff gives typically 2 - 3\ninteractions per event at the Tevatron, and 4 - 5 at the LHC. An important\nfeature is also that the subcollisions are correlated. Central collisions have\nmany interactions, while peripheral collisions have few. In the experimental\nanalyses this is described in terms of an effective cross section \u03c3eff . The cross\nsection \u03c3DPS for the simultaneous hard reactions A and B (with A 6= B) is\nwritten as \u03c3DPS = \u03c3A \u03c3B /\u03c3eff . If the interactions A and B were uncorrelated\nwe would have \u03c3eff equal to the inelastic nondiffractive cross section (\u223c 50\nmb at the Tevatron). Instead the experimental results give the much smaller\nresult \u03c3eff \u2248 15 mb, which thus corresponds to a very strong enhancement.\nAlthough the Pythia model has been tuned to fit most of the CDF\ndata on minimum bias and underlying events, there are a number of open\nquestions:\n- How does a many-parton system hadronize in an event with multiple\nhard subcollisions? The result expected in the string hadronization model is\nillustrated in fig. 2. In a hard gluon-gluon subcollision the outgoing gluons\nwill be colour-connected to the projectile and target remnants, as shown\nin fig. 2a. Initial state radiation may give extra gluon \"kinks\", which are\nordered in rapidity. A second hard scattering would naively be expected to\ngive two new strings connected to the remnants as in fig. 2b. As a result this\nwould give almost doubled multiplicity. This is not in agreement with data.\nIn the successful fits [6] it is instead assumed that the gluons are colour\nreconnected, so that the total string length becomes as short as possible,\nsee fig. 2c. This colour reconnection implies that a minimum number of\nhadrons share the transverse momentum of the partons.\n- In most analysis, including Pythia, it is assumed that the impact\nparameter and momentum distributions of the interacting partons factorize.\nIn a dipole cascade model strong non-factorizing correlations are expected\nbetween impact parameter, momentum, and multiplicity of the colliding\npartons in a proton. Besides such correlations, also the expected large\n\n\f4\n\nepiphany \u0307gg\n\n(a)\n\nprinted on June 9, 2018\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 2.

(c)\nIn the fits to data the gluons are colour reconnected, so that the total string length\nbecomes as short as possible.\n\nfluctuations in multiplicity and impact parameter distributions are more\ndifficult to include in a momentum space formalism.\n3. Eikonal formalism\nA formalism in transverse coordinate space is very suitable for describing\nrescattering and multiple collisions. In a process where a particle undergoes\nsuccessive interactions with\nP transverse momenta k\u22a5i , the resulting transverse momentum k\u22a5 =\nk\u22a5i is given by a convolution of the different\ninteractions. As the Fourier transform of a convolution is given by a simple\nproduct, we see that in impact parameter space the multiple interactions\nare described by a product of the S-matrix elements for the individual interactions:\nS(b) = S1 (b)S2 (b)S3 (b).\n(1)\nThus for Si = e\u2212\u03b7i (b) we find S = e\u2212\n\nP\n\n\u03b7i\n\n.\n\n3.1.

We may however\nimagine that within some distance r0 from a colour charge it is approximately a Coulomb field, while for larger distances the charge is screened by\nother charges. If r0 is around 0.1 fm this would give an effective cutoff for\nhard subcollisions with p\u22a5min \u2248 10 fm\u22121 \u2248 2 GeV, as obtained in the fits to\nexperimental data.\nA bremsstrahlung gluon from this field will change the colour of the\ninitial charge. If e.g. the initial charge is a red quark, it may emit a redantiblue gluon and change its colour to blue. The result is that the initial\nred Coulomb field now terminates at the gluon charge, and a blue-antiblue\ndipole field is formed between the quark and the gluon. The emission of\nsofter gluons now get two separate contributions, one from the modified\nCoulomb field and one from the new colour dipole between the quark and\nthe gluon. The repeated emission of more gluons results in a cascade, as\ndiscussed in the next section.\n3.2. The Mueller dipole model\nA dipole cascade model in transverse coordinate space was developed\nby A. Mueller in a series of papers [11]. We study an initial colour neutral\n\n\f6\n\nepiphany \u0307gg\n\nprinted on June 9, 2018\n\nx\n\nr\nr1\nred\n\nx\n\nE\u22a5\n\nx\nz\n\nz\n\nr2\n\nw\n\nred\n\nR\n\ny\n\ny\n\n(a)\n\ny\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 4.

Repeated emissions give a cascade, which\nproduces a chain of dipoles.\n\nquark-antiquark system. The colour dipole field gets two contributions of\nthe form in eq. (2), as shown in fig. 4a. Adding these with opposite signs\nthe resulting transverse colour-electric field E\u22a5 is given by\n2\n\u223c g2\nE\u22a5\n\nR2\n,\nr12r22\n\n(5)\n\nwhere R is the size of the parent dipole, and r1 and r2 are the distances\nfrom the point r to the two charges (see fig. 4a). As discussed above this\nimplies that the probability to emit a gluon in the point r becomes\ndP\nd2 r R2\n= \u1fb1\n.\ndy\n2\u03c0 r12 r22\n\n(6)\n\nIf the initial charges were e.g. red and antired, the emitted gluon may be\nred-antiblue, changing the initially red charge to blue. Therefore such an\nemission implies that the dipole is split in two connected dipoles, one blueantiblue and one red-antired. These can then also split repeatedly in a\ndipole cascade, as shown in fig. 4b. In ref. [11] it is demonstrated that this\ncascade reproduces the LL BFKL evolution.\nWhen two such cascades collide as in fig. 5, two dipoles (i and j with\nendpoints (r1 , r2 ) and (r3 , r4 ) respectively) may interact via gluon exchange.\nAdding coherently the exchange between charge or anticharge in both dipoles\ngives the interaction probability\n\u03b12\nfij = s ln2\n8\n\n(r1 \u2212 r3 )2 (r2 \u2212 r4 )2\n(r1 \u2212 r4 )2 (r2 \u2212 r3 )2\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nAs the exchanged gluon carries colour, the dipole chains are reconnected,\nas also indicated in fig. 5. The result is two dipole chains connecting the\nremnants of the projectile and the target systems, as also illustrated in fig. 2.\nIt is also possible that several pairs (i, j) interact.

There\nis also a dipole loop (marked A) within the left system, caused by a \"dipole swing\".\nThe parts of the evolutions marked B and C do not interact, and should be treated\nas virtual.\n\n\u2022 LL BFKL is not good enough. NLL corrections are very large.\n\u2022 Non-linear effects in the evolution are not included.\n\u2022 Massless gluon exchange implies a violation of Froissart's bound.\n\u2022 It is difficult to include fluctuations and correlations; the BK equation\nrepresents a mean field approximation.\n\u2022 They can only describe inclusive features, and not the production of\nexclusive final states.\n\u2022 Analytic calculations are mainly applicable at extreme energies, well\nbeyond what can be reached experimentally.\n3.4. Monte Carlo simulations\nNon-leading effects, e.g. effects of energy conservation and a running\ncoupling, are often easier included in Monte Carlo simulations. A simulation\nof Muller's cascade model has been presented by Salam [12]. However, as the\ndipole splitting diverges for small dipole sizes, r, (see eq. (6)) this simulation\nis hampered by numerical difficulties. It is noticed that the fluctuations in\nthe number of dipoles is very large, which causes serious problems.\n\n\fepiphany \u0307gg\n\nprinted on June 9, 2018\n\n9\n\n4. A new approach\nIn refs. [1, 2] we describe a modification of Mueller's cascade model with\nthe following features:\n\u2022 It includes essential NLL BFKL effects.\n\u2022 It includes non-linear effects in the evolution.\n\u2022 It includes essential correlations and fluctuations.\n\u2022 It can also describe exclusive final states.\nThe model is also implemented in a Monte Carlo simulation program.\nHere the NLL effects significantly reduce the production of small dipoles,\nand thereby also the associated numerical difficulties with very large dipole\nmultiplicities are avoided. Confinement corrections are also included, but\nthis is numerically less important than NLL and non-linear effects.\n4.1. NLL effects\nThe NLL corrections to BFKL evolution have three major sources [13]:\n\u2022 The running coupling.\nThis is relatively easily included in a MC simulation process.\n\u2022 Non-singular terms in the splitting function.\nThese terms suppress large z-values in the individual branchings, and\nprevent the daughter from being faster than her recoiling parent. Most\nof this effect is taken care of by including energy-momentum conservation in the evolution.\n\u2022 Projectile-target symmetry.\nThis is also called energy scale terms, and is essentially equivalent to\nthe so called consistency constraint. This effect is taken into account\nby conservation of both positive and negative lightcone momentum\ncomponents, p+ and p\u2212 .\nThe treatment of these effects includes effects beyond NLL, in a way similar to the treatment by Salam in ref. [13]. Thus the power \u03bbeff , determining\nthe growth for small x, is not negative for large values of \u03b1s .\n4.2. Non-linear effects and saturation\nAs mentioned above, dipole loops within the evolution, as indicated by\nthe letter A in fig. 6, are not included in Mueller's cascade model or in the\nJIMWLK or BK equations. Like for dipole scattering the probability for\nsuch loops is given by \u03b1s , and therefore formally colour suppressed compared\nto dipole splitting, which is proportional to \u1fb1 = Nc \u03b1s /\u03c0. These loops are\ntherefore related to the probability that two dipoles have the same colour.\n\n\f10\n\nepiphany \u0307gg\n\na\n\nprinted on June 9, 2018\n\nc\n\nd\n\nb\n\nFig. 7. Schematic picture of a dipole swing. If the two dipoles a and b have the\nsame color, they can be replaced by the dipoles c and d. The result is a closed loop\nformed within an individual dipole cascade.\n\nTwo dipoles with the same colour form a quadrupole. Such a field may be\nbetter approximated by two dipoles formed by the closest colour-anticolour\ncharges. This corresponds to a recoupling of the colour dipole chains, as\nindicated in fig. 7. We call this process a dipole \"swing\". Although this\nmechanism does not give an explicitly frame independent result, MC simulations show that it is a very good approximation (see also fig. 8 below).\nWe note that in this formulation the number of dipoles is not reduced. The\nsaturation effect is obtained because the swing favours the formation of\nsmaller dipoles, which have a smaller cross section. Thus in an evolution\nin momentum space the swing would not correspond to an absorption of\n2 = Q2 (x); it would rather correspond to\ngluons below the saturation line k\u22a5\ns\nlifting the gluons to higher k\u22a5 above this line.\n4.3. Confinement\nThe exchange of massless gluons gives an interaction of infinite range,\nwhich eventually will violate Froissart's bound. This long range interaction is suppressed by introducing an effective gluon mass. Thus the gluon\n2 is replaced by 1/(k 2 + m2 ). This implies that the expropagater 1/k\u22a5\n\u22a5\npression for the transverse electric field in eq. (2) should be replaced by\nr/(rrmax )K1 (r/rmax ), and in the interaction probability in eq. (7) the logarithms ln(1/r) are replaced by K0 (rmax /r). Here rmax = 1/m and K1 and\nK0 are modified Bessel functions. For small values of r the expressions are\nunchanged, but when r becomes larger than rmax they become exponentially\nsuppressed.\n4.4. Exclusive final states\nAs the size of a dipole is also associated with (the inverse of) its transverse momentum, the event depicted in fig. 6 can also be interpreted as an\nexclusive final state with definite parton momenta. It is true that taking\n\n\fepiphany \u0307gg\n\nprinted on June 9, 2018\n\n11\n\nthe Fourier transform is not exactly the same as replacing r by r/r 2 . Therefore, when there is a conflict, what we really are generating is perhaps not r\nwith the approximation k\u22a5 \u2248 1/r, but rather generating k\u22a5 with r \u2248 1/k\u22a5 .\nThere are also some other problems which have to be solved. In the evolution of a particle with a high value for the lightcone momentum, p+ , but\nvery little p\u2212 , the gluons in the cascade will accumulate a large deficit of\np\u2212 , which has to be \"payed back\" when it collides with a target having a\nlarge p\u2212 but small p+ . Dipole chains like the ones indicated by B and C in\nfig. 6, which do not interact, can not come on shell and have to be treated\nas virtual. Thus only gluons which are connected to daughters involved in\nthe collisions should be included in the initial state radiation.\nAn important feature is that all dipoles are connected in chains, which\nimplies strong non-trivial correlations [14]. A toy model calculation by R.\nCorke [15] shows that such correlations can have a big effect on the need for\ncolour reconnections in the final state.\nThe full calculation of the final state properties is not yet implemented\nin the MC, but will be ready in the near future.\n5. Applications\nFor the results presented in this section we have used a simple model for\nthe proton wave function, in form of three dipoles in an equilateral triangle. For larger Q2 the wavefunction for a virtual photon is determined by\nperturbation theory, but for smaller Q2 it is necessary to include a nonperturbative component representing the soft hadronic part of the photon. For\nmore details see ref. [2].\n5.1. Total cross sections\nThe total pp cross section is shown in fig. 8a. We note that the onepomeron result, which neglects unitarity constraints, is about a factor four\ntoo high at Tevatron energies. Also saturation effects inside the evolution,\nsimulated by the swing, have a significant effect, reducing the cross section\nby about 30%. We also see that including the swing makes the result obtained in the rest frame of the target (long dashed line) very close to the\nresult in the cms (solid line), which shows that the result is almost Lorentz\nframe independent.\nThe total \u03b3 \u2217 p cross section is presented in fig. 8b against the GolecBiernat\u2013W\u00fcsthoff scaling parameter \u03c4 = Q2 /Q2s , where Q2s = Q20 (x0 /x)\u03bb\nwith Q0 = 1GeV, x0 = 3 * 10\u22124 , \u03bb = 0.29 [3]. We note that our result, in\nagreement with the data, satisfies geometric scaling both for small \u03c4 , where\nthe result is influenced by saturation, and for larger \u03c4 where saturation is\nnot essential.\n\n\f12\n\nepiphany \u0307gg\n\nprinted on June 9, 2018\n\n103\n\n300\nWith swing\nWith swing, Lab\nWith swing, 1-pom.\nNo swing\nNo swing, Lab\nNo swing, 1-pom.\n\n250\n\n102\n\u03c3\u03b3 ptot(\u03bcb)\n\n150\n\n101\n\n*\n\n\u03c3 (mb)\n\n200\n\nswing + quark masses\nH1, ZEUS\n\n100\n\n100\n50\n\n0\n101\n\nTevatron\n\n102\n\n103\n\u221as (GeV)\n\nAGASA\n\n104\n\n10-1\n10-2\n\n105\n\n10-1\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\n\u03c4\n\nFig. 8.

The position of this dip can\nbe tuned at one energy, but the change to smaller t at higher energies is a\nresult of the evolution, which cannot be tuned.\nQuasielastic \u03b3 \u2217 p scattering is also well reproduced by the model, including the dependence on Q2 , W , and t.

Two different wavefunctions have been used for the \u03c1-meson, boosted\nGaussian (solid line) and DGKP (dashed line).\n\nthe Q2 -dependence for DVCS and the W -dependence for \u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 \u03c1p. For\nthe latter case two different \u03c1-meson wavefunctions were used, a boosted\nGaussian wavefunction [23] and the DGKP [24] wavefunction. Both models\nshow similar growth with W , but our normalization agrees better with the\nboosted Gaussian wavefunction.\n5.3. Diffraction\nAs discussed above diffractive excitation is directly determined by the\nfluctuations in the evolution. As an example, if we calculate the expression\nZ\n\nd2 b{hh1 \u2212 e\u2212\n\nP\n\nfij 2\niL iR\n\n\u2212 h1 \u2212 e\u2212\n\nP\n\nfij 2\niLR }\n\n(9)\n\nin a frame where the right-moving proton is evolved yR rapidity units, it\ngives the cross section for single diffractive excitation of this proton to\n2 < M 2 exp(y ), with M \u223c 1 GeV. Here L and R\nmasses satisfying MX\nR\n0\n0\nindicate averages over left- and right-moving proton cascades respectively.\nThe result obtained when varying yR is shown in fig. 11a compared with\ncorresponding results from the Tevatron.\nWe also note that as the fluctuations in the evolution are quite large, less\nfluctuations are needed in the impact parameter profile. Thus this profile\nis more gray, and less black and white, than in fits where the fluctuations\nin the evolution are not taken into account. This is seen in fig. 11b, which\nshows a comparison between our model and the result by Kowalski and\nTeaney [26] for the scattering of a dipole against a proton. In the latter\nanalysis the fluctuations in the evolution are not included.\n\n\f14\n\nepiphany \u0307gg\n\nprinted on June 9, 2018\n\n0.4\n\n1.2\nY= 9\nY=11\nKT Y= 9\nKT Y=11\n\n1\nd\u03c3tot/d2b\n\n\u03c3i/\u03c3tot\n\n0.3\n0.2\nEL + SDL+R + DD\nEL\nSDR\nDD\n\n0.1\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nb(GeV-1)\n\nY0/Y\n\nFig. 11.
