Spectroscopy for the 137 still\nunidentified objects has been obtained. The total number of AGN turns out to\nbe 111, 63 of which are new identifications. The properties of the selection are\ndiscussed. The completeness and the success rate for this survey at the final\nstage are 63% and 46%, respectively.\nSubject headings: Catalogs - Surveys - Quasars: general\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nQSOs are an important astrophysical and cosmological tool: they represent a major\nsource of information about the origin and evolution of the structures in the Universe. They\ncan be used either directly, as tracers of the density peaks, or as cosmic lighthouses, probing\nthe Universe along the line of sight with their conspicuous flow of photons.\nEarly stages of galaxy formation are probably connected with QSO activity and central\nBH accretion. In recent years there has been increasing observational evidence that the evolution of normal galaxies and quasars is closely related and that quasars are short-lived. The\nevolution of the global star formation rate of the Universe, the space density of starbursting\ngalaxies and that of luminous QSOs appear to be remarkably similar. Recently Kormendy\n1\n\nBased on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile (ESO P66.A-0277 and ESO\nP67.A-0537), with the Arizona Steward Observatory and with National Telescope Galileo (TNG) during AO3\nperiod.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n(2000a) proposed that such \"monsters\" could be set at the heart of galaxy formation. A\nnumber of models indeed relate QSOs with galaxies both using theoretical (Haehnelt &\nKauffmann 2000; Granato et al. 2001; Monaco et al. 2000; Romano et al. 2001) and observational (Gebhardt et al. 2001; Kormendy 2001) arguments. It is generally accepted now that\nQSO activity, the growth of SMBHs and the formation of spheroids are all closely linked\n(Kormendy 2000b).\nA well defined large sample of bright QSOs at z \u2264 0.3 is instrumental in confirming or\nrevising our conceptions about the evolution of QSOs and constitutes a significant challenge\nfor any theoretical model. In particular, it provides key informations on the following issues:\nwhat is the typical mass of Dark Matter Halos hosting AGN ? What is the duty cycle for\nAGN activity ? What is the typical efficiency of the central engine at the various redshifts ?\nIt is paradoxical that in the era of 2dF (Croom et al. 2001; Shanks et al. 2000) and\nSDSS (Fan et al. 2000), with thousands of faint QSOs discovered up to the highest redshifts\n(z = 6.28), the statistical properties of the QSO population are much better known at z \u223c 2\nthan in the local Universe. The aim of this work is to fill this gap with a very large area\nsearch for bright and low-z AGN, the Asiago-ESO/RASS QSO Survey (hereafter AERQS).\nAt present, the Northern Sample described in Grazian et al. (2000) (hereafter Paper I) is\n85% identified and spectroscopic observations have been planned to complete the survey.\nThe structure of this paper is the following: in \u00a7 2 we report on the Southern Photometry\nused, the selection criteria are described in \u00a7 3; \u00a7 4 is dedicated to the New Southern Sample\nand its statistical properties (selections, completeness, efficiency); finally on \u00a7 5 we discuss\nthe properties of the completely identified sample, showing the spectra of newly identified\nAGN and galaxies. We assume H0 = 50 Km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9m = 1.0 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.0. A detailed\ntreatment of the LF and clustering properties of AGN is left to forthcoming papers.\n\n2.\n\nThe Southern Photometry\n\nThe surface density of bright AGN at low redshift is very small, around 10\u22122 sq. deg.\u22121\nas shown in Fig. 1. In practice, to reach significant statistics, an area comparable with the\nwhole sky has to be covered. In Paper I we have discussed a number of databases sampling\na wide domain in the electro-magnetic (e.m.) spectrum for the selection of an all-sky sample\nof optically bright QSOs with a high level of completeness and success rate.\nIn the northern part of the AERQS the basis of the optical photometry was chosen to\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nbe the US Naval Observatory Catalogue (USNO-1A2 ) and the Guide Star Catalogue (GSC13 ) with a typical error of 0.2-0.3 in magnitude. For the Southern Sample we have tried to\nimprove the optical photometry, using the positions and optical magnitudes derived from the\nDigitized Sky Survey (DSS4 ). For each target of interest (the selection is described in \u00a7 3) all\nthe objects with known BJ magnitudes within a radius of 1.5 arcmin were extracted from the\nGSC Catalogue. Small scans of the target and the GSC calibrating objects were extracted\nfrom the DSS plates. Instrumental magnitudes were then computed by aperture photometry\nin a circular area of 7.5 arcsec radius (9 DSS pixels diameter). A polynomial calibration curve\nis used to interpolate the magnitudes of the target. A typical calibration curve is shown in\nFig. 2. We have tested the accuracy of this procedure using 446 photometric standards of the\ninput catalogue used to calibrate the photometric material of the Homogeneous Bright QSO\nSurvey (Cristiani et al. 1995), deriving a \u03c3BJ of 0.10 mag in the interval 12.0 \u2264 BJ \u2264 15.5.\nThe 7.5 arcsec aperture size (corresponding to a radius of 18.5 Kpc at z = 0.1) is\nthe result of a trade-off between the attempt to estimate nuclear magnitudes for our AGN\n(reducing the contribution of the host galaxy) and the necessity of a photometry that is\n\"robust\" against errors in the centering of the aperture. By comparing our photometry with\nthe GSC2 catalogue we find, for the 80 AGN of Tab. 1 that have GSC2 J magnitudes, a\nmean difference < JGSC2 \u2212 BJ >= 0.10 with a scatter of 0.4 mag, which can be ascribed\nto photometric errors and AGN variability. Using larger apertures obviously increases the\ncontribution of the host galaxy. For example if we compare the magnitudes obtained with a\n7.5 arcsec circular aperture with the magnitudes in a 15 arcsec aperture, for the 111 AGN\nof Tab. 1 we obtain a < BJ (7.5) \u2212 BJ (15.0) >= 0.5 with a scatter of 0.4.\nWe have used only plates based on IIIaJ emulsion to compute the magnitudes, as other\nemulsions are not standard and difficult to calibrate. This, together with the selection criteria\ndescribed below, is the source of non uniformity of the sky coverage. Fig. 3 shows the area\nof the sky covered by the present survey. Table 2 provides a list of the sky sub-areas plotted\nin Fig. 3, which total 5660 sq. deg. of the Southern Hemisphere.\n2\n\nhttp://archive.eso.org/servers/usnoa-server\n\n3\n\nhttp://www-gsss.stsci.edu/gsc/gsc12/\n\n4\n\nhttp://archive.eso.org/dss/dss\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.\n\nThe Selection Criteria\n\nQSO candidates have been selected by cross correlating the X-ray sources in the ROSAT\nAll Sky Survey Bright Source Catalog (RASS-BSC, Voges et al. (1999)) with optically bright\nobjects in the DSS plates. As stated in Paper I, given the low surface density of local bright\nAGN, misidentifications are very unlikely since we adopt a matching radius that is three\ntimes the RMS positional uncertainty of each X-ray source (typically 15-20 arcsec).\nWe want to stress here that this survey aims at finding optically bright QSOs and the\nX-ray emission is used only to compute an \"X-Optical color\" for the selection of AGN.\nTherefore the result of our selection cannot be considered an identification of X-ray sources.\nThis makes the follow-up spectroscopy quicker than in the case of optical identifications of\nX-ray sources, because we do not care about objects fainter than the chosen optical flux\nlimits and mis-identifications of optically fainter X-ray sources have no effect on the result.\nWe applied to the X-ray catalogue a number of criteria that do not affect drastically\nthe completeness of our survey (basically the same used in Paper I): exposure time texp \u2265\n300s, Galactic latitude |bgal | \u2265 30\u25e6 , hardness ratio in the 0.5\u00f72.0 and 0.1\u00f70.4 keV energy\nbands \u22120.9 \u2264 HR1 \u2264 +0.9, hardness ratio in the 0.9\u00f72.0 and 0.5\u00f70.9 keV energy bands\n\u22120.6 \u2264 HR2 \u2264 +0.8, likelihood of extent likext \u2264 35 to avoid extended X-ray sources;\nthis corresponds to a limit for source extent ext \u2264 100 in agreement with the preliminary\nresults of the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) survey (Voges et al. (2001) and C. Mullis private\ncommunications, 2001). In addition the likelihood of detection likdet \u2265 25 to select only\nreliable sources, with a significant level of detection in the RASS-BSC. These parameters\nhave been described extensively in Voges et al. (1999).\nThen we apply two basic criteria:\n\u2022 12.60 \u2264 BJ \u2264 15.13\nand\n\u2022 aox \u2264 1.9\nwhere aox = \u22120.438log10 (cps) \u2212 0.193BJ + 4.20 and cps is the X-ray flux measured in\ncounts per second.\nWe have used the selection criterion \u03b1ox \u2264 \u03b1max which, as shown in Fig. 1 of Paper\nI, for objects brighter than the adopted optical limits provides a sample with a degree of\nincompleteness that is not a function of the apparent magnitude. We have compared the\npresent selection with the low redshift (z \u2264 0.3) optically or IR selected QSOs of the V\u00e9ron\nCatalogue (V\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron (2001), hereafter VV01): out of the 67 QSOs known\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nwithin our spatial and optical flux limits, 42 (63 %) meet our selection criteria. Radio or\nX-ray selected AGN are not taken into account, to avoid biases in the estimation of the\ncompleteness.\nThe adopted selections in likdet , likext , HR1 and HR2 remove 25% of the RASS sources\nthat are probably stars, extended X-ray sources and other spurious contaminants; spectroscopic identifications for these sources are not available. The application of the same criteria\nfor the AGN in the VV01 Catalogue lowers the completeness from 64% to 63%; we can\nconclude, as in Paper I, that the adopted criteria increase the effectiveness without affecting\nthe completeness.\nWe have selected a total of 243 candidates in the Southern Hemisphere over \u223c5660\nsq. deg. at high Galactic latitude |bgal | \u2265 30\u25e6 . They are listed in Tab. 1.\n\n4.\n\nThe Southern Sample\n\nOf the 243 candidates belonging to the southern part of the AERQS, 45% had previous\nspectroscopic identifications in the literature (V\u00e9ron Catalogue, NED5 ). For the remaining 137 objects we started an observational campaign. We had several runs with different\ntelescopes for a total of 7 nights: Tab. 3 summarizes the observations.\nThe reduction process used the standard MIDAS facilities (Banse et al. 1983) and other\nuseful software available at ESO Garching through the SCISOFT6 environment. The raw\ndata were sky-subtracted and corrected for pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations by division\nwith a suitably normalized exposure of the spectrum of an incandescent source (flat-field).\nThe wavelength calibration was carried out by comparison with exposures of He and Ne\nlamps. Relative flux calibration was carried out by observations of spectrophotometric standard stars (Oke 1990). For extended objects, only the core/nucleus flux was considered.\nThe identification classes reported in Table 1 are: AGN = Active Galactic Nucleus;\nST AR = star; GAL = galaxy; BLLAC = BL Lac object.\nObjects with emission lines were classified as AGN only if they show broad and/or\nstrong lines (typically H\u03b1 , H\u03b2 or Mg II). Galaxies with a weak (EW \u2264 12\u00c5) unresolved H\u03b1\nand no other features of AGN activity are classified as EM GAL and, together with the\nnewly identified AGN or normal galaxies, are shown in Fig.4,5,6,7,8,9. The objects classified\n5\n\nhttp://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\n6\n\nhttp://www.eso.org/science/scisoft/\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nas BL Lacs in Tab. 1 were already known from the literature (VV01 Catalogue). In the next\nsection we will describe more in detail the emission line galaxies and try to interpret their\nproperties.\nAt the end of our spectroscopic campaign we have carried out 137 new identifications;\nwe have discovered more than 60 new AGN, significantly enlarging the number of bright\nQSOs at z \u2264 0.3. Fig. 10 shows the redshift distribution of the AGN in this sample.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have found 111 AGN out of 243 candidates, corresponding to a success rate of 46%.\nStars are the mean source of contamination, especially active M stars, which are powerful Xray emitters compared to their optical magnitudes, resembling the aox of AGN. To distinguish\nthem effectively an optical color, for example B \u2212 R, would be extremely useful as these two\nclasses have typically different optical spectral energy distributions. We have obtained J\nand F magnitudes, equivalent to B and R respectively, from the GSC-27 catalogue for all\nthe object of this survey. In Fig. 11 the J \u2212 F color distribution is plotted for different\nclasses of objects. We have divided AGN into two classes \"Point-like\" and \"Extended\"\nor \"Galaxy-like\" according to the classification given in the GSC-2 catalogue. There is\nno evident difference in colors between these two classes. AGN and normal stars are not so\ndifferent in J \u2212F . M-stars, instead, can be easily separated from AGN. With the application\nof a reasonable cut in the optical color (J \u2212 F \u2264 1.6) the success rate of the present survey\nwould be increased from the present value of 46% to 63% but the completeness would be\naffected as well, decreasing from 63% to a value of 40%. If we compare the \"Extended\" and\n\"Point-like\" AGN of Fig. 11, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gives a probability of 89% that\nthe two samples are extracted from the same population. The mean values of J \u2212 F for the\ntwo samples are similar (0.69 and 0.72 for \"Extended\" and \"Point-like\", respectively) and\nthe dispersion is slightly larger for the \"Extended\" objects.\nA more important consideration is the fact that surveys based only on optical colors,\nassuming typical blue SEDs for AGN, are significantly incomplete especially at low redshift\nand at faint absolute magnitudes, where the host galaxy contribution starts to be relevant.\nFig. 12 shows the dependence of the AGN color J \u2212 F on absolute magnitude MB : faint\nNuclei tend to be redder than the bright QSOs. In Fig. 13 we show the J \u2212 F color\ndistribution for 30 QSOs with z \u2264 0.3 in the PG Survey (Schmidt & Green 1983). We\ncompare it with the same distribution for 80 AGN in the AERQS Survey with z \u2264 0.3: an\n7\n\nhttp://www-gsss.stsci.edu/gsc/gsc2/GSC2home.htm\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nextended tail towards the red J \u2212 F color for the X-ray selected AGN is evident. PG QSOs\nhave typically a blue optical color (J \u2212 F \u2264 1.04). If we had selected only AGN bluer than\nJ \u2212 F \u2264 1.04, 22 (28%) objects would have been missed.\nTwo effects can determine the big spread in the observed J \u2212 F color: the starlight\ncontamination of the host galaxy and the existence of intrinsically red Active Galactic Nuclei.\nAn additional contribution can be due to QSO variability, whose effect is difficult to address\nin detail, as it significantly depends on the time lag between the different flux measurements.\nFrom the analysis of the structure function (Cristiani et al. 1996) we should expect an average\nuncertainty on the J \u2212 F color due to variability of 0.2 mag for QSOs with a typical absolute\nmagnitude MB \u223c \u221225 and 0.3 for MB \u223c \u221223.\nThe contribution of the host galaxy is clearly visible in Fig. 14, where we have normalized and stacked all QSO spectra obtained in this survey. We compare the result with the\ncomposite spectra by SDSS (Vanden Berk et al. 2001), First Bright Quasar Survey (Brotherton et al. 2001) and with a synthetic spectrum used for photometric redshift studies with a\ncontinuum slope of \u03bd \u22121.75 , redder than a typical \u03bd \u22121.2 Blue QSOs. It is clearly visible in our\ncomposite spectrum the red continuum and the strong feature typical of early type galaxies\n(Ca doublet at 3929.3 and 3963.8 \u00c5), producing a significant absorption in the rest-frame\nB band. Besides, it is apparent that for QSOs fainter than MB = \u221224 the contribution of\nthe host galaxy produces a redder SED with respect to QSOs brighter than MB = \u221224.\nK-corrections are computed following the recipe of Cristiani & Vio (1990), but based on the\nnew QSO composite spectra (FBQS and SYNT) plotted in Fig. 14.\nIn Fig. 15 we have tried to model the pattern of J \u2212 F color observed in Fig. 12. To\nreproduce the full range in J \u2212 F color, both a contamination from the host galaxy and the\nexistence of AGN bluer and redder than the adopted composite spectra are necessary. QSO\nvariability and photometric errors are expected to increase the scatter observed in Fig. 12\nwith respect to Fig. 15. Clearly the synthetic QSO spectrum is too red with respect to the\nobserved J \u2212 F distribution, while the FBQS composite spectrum is roughly in agreement\nwith the observations (a slightly bluer QSO spectrum would produce an even better match).\nA morphological analysis of individual cases is required in order to quantify the relative\nincidence of these effects.\nThere are 5 objects with H\u03b1 in emission, faint [O III] doublet and no other signature\nof AGN activity. We have classified them as EM GAL in Table 1. They could be special\ncases, for example AGN obscured by dusty torus, according to the unified model. Another\npossibility is that they are normal starbursts or liners, common in a soft X-ray survey like the\nROSAT sample. Further analysis, for example using hard X-ray observations with Chandra\nor XMM-Newton, can shed light on their nature and disentangle between Starburst and AGN\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nactivity. In the following papers only objects classified as bona-fide AGN will be taken into\naccount to study properties like clustering or Luminosity Function.\nThe LogN-LogS relation for AGN belonging to this sample is shown in Fig. 1 and\ncompared with the relation found by K\u00f6hler et al. (1997) for QSOs with 0.07 \u2264 z \u2264 2.2. It\nis also consistent with the same relation found for the northern part of the AERQS.\nWith the completion of the southern part of the AERQS a statistically well-defined set\nof 340 bright QSOs with z \u2264 0.3 has been collected. On the basis of the measured\nsuccess rate, at the end of the present project, we expect to provide a full-sky\n\"local\" sample of 400 AGN.\nWe warmly thank the referee for carefully reading the manuscript, for useful suggestions\nand for improving significantly the quality of this paper.
