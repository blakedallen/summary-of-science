We propose that the giant HI ring recently discovered by\nHIPASS for S0 galaxy NGC 1533 is formed by unequal-mass merging\nbetween gas-rich LSB (low surface brightness: \"ghost\") galaxies and HSB\ndisks. The NGC 1533 progenitor HSB spiral is transformed into a barred\nS0 during merging and the outer HI gas disk of the LSB is transformed\ninto the giant HI ring. We also discuss two different possibilities for the\norigin of isolated star-forming regions (\"ELdot\" objects) in the giant gas\nring.\n\n1.\n\nRing formation from tidal disruption of LSBs\n\nRecent observational results of NGC 1533 HI rings and numerical models for\nthis objects are described in detail by Ryan-Weber et al. (2002) and by Bekki\net al. (2003, in preparation), respectively. We accordingly summarize briefly\nthe important three results derived in this numerical studies (See Figure 1 for\nthe model details). Firstly, the strong tidal filed of NGC 1533's progenitor\nHSB strips the outer diffuse HI gas disk of the LSB and completely destroy\nthe stellar disk of the LSB. The stripped HI gas forms an incomplete gas ring\nand the LSB is swallowed by the HSB finally. This outer HI ring formation is\ndifferent from the merger scenario of polar ring formation proposed by Bekki\n(1998). Secondly, the HSB forms a bar and loses its spiral arms owing to tidal\nheating of the interaction, and therefore can be classified as a barred S0 after\nmerging. Thirdly, star formation can proceed in the giant gas ring either by the\ncloud-cloud collisions within the ring or by strong external gaseous pressure of\nthe hot gas surrounding the HI ring. The proposed merger models thus explain\n(1) the observed large total mass of the HI ring, (2) structure and kinematics of\nthe HI ring, and (3) the morphology of the host S0 galaxy (NGC 1533).\nReferences\nRyan-Weber, E., Webster, R., & Bekki, K., 2002, preprint (astro-ph/0209321).\nBekki, K., 1998, ApJ, 499, 635\n1\n\n\f2\n\nK.

Both disk are modeled based on the\nFall-Efstathiou disk models, and the LSB's central surface brightness\nis 1 mag fainter than that of the HSB. The HI gas disk of the LSB is\nassumed to extend 2 times optical radius of the LSB. The total HI gas\nmass of the LSB is assumed to be the same as that of the optical one.\nThe pericenter and the eccentricity of the orbit in this LSB-HSB merger\nare set to be 0.5 \u00d7 Rd and 0.8, respectively, where Rd is the disk size of\nthe HSB. TREESPH code is used and an isothermal equation of state\nis adopted for the gas with a temperature of 7.3\u00d7103 K (corresponding\nto a sound speed of 10 km s\u22121 ). Star formation (the Schmidt law) is\nalso included in the SPH simulations. As the two disks merge with each\nother, only the LSB disk (both gas and stars) is ditroyed by the HSB's\ntidal field to form outer giant HI gas rings. Since the rings originate\nfrom the outer gas disk of the LSB, the rings are composed mostly of\ngas and the total mass of the ring can be estimated to be more than a\nfew 109 M\u2299 . The shapes of the rings and the velocity field of the HI gas\nring reflect the initial LSB's orbit with respect to the HSB. Some local\nregions along the ring have higher gas density and thus could be the\npossible formation sites of young stars, which are observed as \"ELdots\"\nobjects.\n\n\fThis figure \"ring.f1.copy.gif\" is available in \"gif\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/astro-ph/0310358v1\n\n\f"}
