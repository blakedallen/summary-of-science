In particular, there are only\nfinitely many symplectic deformation types for each quotient surface singularity.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn recent years, the geometry of contact structures on three manifolds has been\na subject of intensive studies. In particular, tight contact structures have been\nthe focus of interest. For instance, tight contact structures on lens spaces have\nnow been classified by Giroux and Honda. The link L of an isolated surface\nsingularity (V, O) provides examples of tight contact three manifolds. Namely,\nthe complex tangency to the link gives a codimension one distribution \u03be =\nT L \u2229J(T L) which is completely non-integrable, hence a contact structure. Here\nJ is the complex structure on V \\ O. Let \u03c0 : Ve \u2192 V be a resolution of the\nsingularity and U a neighborhood of O in V such that \u2202U = L. Then \u03c0 \u22121 (U )\nis a so-called symplectic filling of (L, \u03be) and \u03be is a symplectically fillable contact\nstructure, which implies that \u03be is tight by a theorem of Eliashberg and Gromov.\nIt is also interesting to classify symplectic fillings of the links of certain\nclasses of isolated surface singularities. For the case of cyclic quotient singularities of An,1 -type, McDuff classified symplectic deformation classes of minimal\nsymplectic fillings [6]. H. Ohta and the second named author investigated the\ncases of simple singularities [9] and simple elliptic singularities [11]. Meanwhile,\nLisca [3] presents a classification for the case of cyclic quotient singularities. In\nthis paper, we study the case of quotient surface singularities C/\u0393, where \u0393 is a\nfinite subgroup of Gl(2; C). Note that this class contains all simple singularities,\nwhich is the case where \u0393 \u2282 Sl(2; C). Simple singularities are characterized as\nisolated surface singularities which are described by both quotient singularities\nand hypersurface singularities. Thus we can use both aspects in the argument.\nNamely, since they are quotient singularities, the link is a spherical space form.\n\u2217 Partly supported by the Grant-in-Aid in Scientific Research No. 14340019, Japan Society\nfor the Promotion of Science.\n\n1\n\n\fIn particular, they carry a metric of positive scalar curvature. This fact is one\nof main ingredients in [8]. They are also hypersurface singularities with explicit\ndefining equations. This enables us to describe the compactifications of their\nMilnor fibres in appropriate weighted projective spaces (K. Saito). The results\nin [9] are some of the main ingredients in this paper. Since the situation here is\nmore complicated than in the case of simple singularities, we have to study rational curves with negative self-intersection numbers carefully. The main theorem\nis the following.\nTheorem 1.1 A symplectic filling of the link of a quotient surface singularity\nis symplectic deformation equivalent to the complement of a certain divisor in\nan iterated blow-up of CP 2 or CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 .\nA detailed description of the symplectic fillings is given later. In particular,\nwe get finiteness of symplectic deformation types of minimal symplectic fillings\nfor each quotient surface singularity.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nOur basic strategy is the following. Firstly, find an appropriate strong concave\nfilling Y of the link of the singularity and glue it with a given symplectic filling\nX to get a closed symplectic 4-manifold Z. Secondly, use a rationality criterion\nfor symplectic 4-manifolds in order to show that Z is rational. Thirdly, study\nhow Y is embedded in the rational symplectic 4-manifold Z. Eventually, Y\nis chosen as a regular neighborhood of a certain divisor K in a blow-up of a\nrational ruled surface. (We call K a compactifying divisor.) So the third step\nis replaced by the study of embeddings of K in Z.\nIn this section, we present several facts which are necessary to carry out these\nsteps. First of all, we recall some basic results for rational and ruled symplectic\n4-manifolds.\nTheorem 2.1 (McDuff [6]) Let (M, \u03c9) be a closed symplectic 4-manifold. If\nM contains a symplectically embedded 2-sphere C of nonnegative self-intersection\nnumber k, then M is either a rational symplectic 4-manifold or a blow-up of a\nruled symplectic 4-manifold. In particular, if k = 0 (resp. 1), M becomes a ruled\nsymplectic 4-manifold (resp. the complex projective plane) after blowing down\nsymplectic (\u22121)-curves away from C.\nHere a rational symplectic 4-manifold means a symplectic blow-up of the\ncomplex projective plane at some points, and a ruled symplectic 4-manifold\nmeans a 2-sphere bundles over an oriented surface with a symplectic structure\nwhich is nondegenerate on each fibre. Combining Theorem 2.1 and Taubes'\ntheorem \"SW=Gr\", we get the following.\nTheorem 2.2 (Ohta\u2013Ono\n[7], Liu [4]) Let (M, \u03c9) be a closed symplectic 4R\nmanifold such that M c1 (M )\u2227\u03c9 > 0. Then (M, \u03c9) is either a rational symplectic\n4-manifold or a (blow-up of a) ruled symplectic 4-manifold.\n2\n\n\fIf the pseudoholomorphic curve C is singular, we have the following result as\na byproduct of uniqueness of minimal symplectic fillings of the link of a simple\nsingularity [9].\nTheorem 2.3 (Ohta\u2013Ono [10]) Let M be a closed symplectic 4-manifold containing a pseudoholomorphic rational curve C with a (2, 3)-cusp point. Suppose\nthat C is nonsingular away from the (2, 3)-cusp point. If the self-intersection\nnumber C 2 of C is positive, then M must be a rational symplectic 4-manifold\nand C 2 is at most 9. Moreover, if M \\ C does not contain any symplectic (\u22121)curves, then C represents the Poincar\u00e9 dual to c1 (M ), that is, an anti-canonical\ndivisor. When C 2 = 9, M = CP 2 and C is a pseudoholomorphic cuspidal cubic\ncurve.\nWe call a homology class e \u2208 H2 (M ; Z) a symplectic (\u22121)-class if e is represented by a symplectically embedded 2-sphere of self-intersection number \u22121.\nA symplectic (\u22121)-curve class is represented by a J-holomorphic sphere for a\ngeneric compatible (or tame) almost complex structure J. However, if we restrict the class of compatible (or tame) almost complex structure, this may not\nbe the case. Here we have the following (essentially Proposition 4.1 in [10]).\nProposition 2.4 Let M be a symplectic 4-manifold and C1 , . . . , Ck irreducible\nJ0 -holomorphic curves in M with respect to a compatible (or tame) almost\ncomplex structure J0 . Suppose that each of C1 , . . . , Ck is either nondegenerate, singular or of higher genus. Then, for a generic J among compatible (or\ntame) almost complex structures for which C1 , . . . , Ck are pseudoholomorphic,\nany symplectic (\u22121)-curve has a unique J-holomorphic representative.\nHere we call Ci nondegenerate if the linearized operator of the pseudoholomorphic curve equation is surjective at Ci . Now we collect a series of observations.\nIf a pseudoholomorphic curve C intersects a (\u22121)-curve transversally, Lemma 4.1\nin [9] ensures that the image under the blowing down map is also pseudoholomorphic with respect to a suitable almost complex structure. Transversality\nof intersections can be achieved by a small perturbation of the almost complex\nstructure.\nLemma 2.5 Let M be a closed symplectic 4-manifold and L a symplectically\nembedded 2-sphere of self-intersection number 1. Then any irreducible singular\nor higher genus pseudoholomorphic curve C in M satisfies C * L \u2265 3. In particular, neither an irreducible singular nor a higher genus pseudoholomorphic\ncurve is contained in M \\ L.\nProof. If necessary, we perturb the almost complex structure slightly in such\na way that the (\u22121)-curves do not pass through the singular points of C. We\nthen blow down a maximal disjoint family of pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curves\naway from L. Here we can assume that L and C are also pseudoholomorphic\nwith respect to the same almost complex structure (Proposition 2.4). Then M\n3\n\n\fbecomes the complex projective plane and L becomes a line. Since C is singular\nand irreducible or of higher genus, the image C has degree at least 3. Thus we\nhave C * L = C * L \u2265 3.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.6 Let M be a closed symplectic 4-manifold and C a pseudoholomorphic rational curve with a (2, 3)-cusp point as a unique singularity. Suppose\nthat the self-intersection number of C is positive. Then neither an irreducible\nsingular nor a higher genus pseudoholomorphic curve is contained in M \\ C.\nProof. Suppose that D is such a singular or a higher genus pseudoholomorphic\ncurve. Let J be a compatible almost complex structure on M with respect to\nwhich C and D are pseudoholomorphic. By Proposition 2.4, we may assume\nthat all symplectic (\u22121)-classes are represented by J-holomorphic (\u22121)-curves.\nWe blow down a maximal family of J-holomorphic (\u22121)-curves in M \\ C. Thus\nwe may assume that M \\ C does not contain any symplectic (\u22121)-curves. By\nTheorem 2.3, C is an anti-canonical divisor and we have c1 (M )[D] = 0. If D is\nsingular or of higher genus, the adjunction formula tells us that D * D \u2265 0. On\nthe other hand, the intersection form on M \\ C is negative definite. Hence [D]\nis homologous to zero, which is absurd.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.7 Let M and C be as in Lemma 2.6. Suppose that the self-intersection\nnumber of C is at least 2. Then there does not exist a pseudoholomorphic curve\nA such that A is either singular and irreducible or of higher genus and such that\nA * C = 1.\nProof. If such a curve A exists, we blow up M at the intersection point of A\nand C. Then the proper transform of A violates the conclusion of Lemma 2.6.\n\u0003\nIf the self-intersection number of C is 1, there exist singular or genus 1\npseudoholomorphic curves A such that A * C = 1. In addition, if M \\ C is\nminimal, it turns out that A is homologous to C in M .\nLemma 2.8 Let M be a closed symplectic 4 manifold and L a symplectically\nembedded sphere of self-intersection number 1. Then no symplectically embedded\nsphere of nonnegative self-intersection number is contained in M \\ L. Pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curves in M \\ L are mutually disjoint.\nLemma 2.9 Let M be a closed symplectic 4-manifold and C an irreducible\nsingular or higher genus pseudoholomorphic curve. Then no symplectically embedded sphere of nonnegative self-intersection number is contained in M \\ C.\nProof. Let A be a symplectically embedded sphere in M \\C. Set k = A*A. If k =\n1, the result follows from Lemma 2.5. If k > 1, blow up M at k \u2212 1 points on A.\nThe proper transform of A has self-intersection number 1. So this case is reduced\nto the case where k = 1. If k = 0, we blow down a maximal disjoint family\n\n4\n\n\fof pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curves away from A. Note that Proposition 2.4\nguarantees that these (\u22121)-curves and C are pseudoholomorphic with respect\nto the same almost complex structure. The blown-down manifold is a ruled\nsymplectic 4-manifold and A is a fibre. Since C is singular and irreducible or\nof higher genus, its image C under the blowing down map is also singular and\nirreducible or of higher genus. Thus it is not a fibre of the ruling. Since fibres\nsweep out the whole space, C should intersect a fibre. This contradicts the fact\n\u0003\nthat C * A = C * A = 0.\nSimilarly, we get the following.\nLemma 2.10 Let M be a closed symplectic 4-manifold and C a singular pseudoholomorphic curve. Then there is no symplectically embedded sphere A of nonnegative self-intersection number such that A * C = 1.\nProof. If k = A * A is positive, we blow up M at k points on A \\ C. So we may\nassume that k = 0. We blow down a maximal disjoint family of pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curves away from A to get a ruled symplectic 4-manifold. Then\nthe image C of C under the blowing down map satisfies C * A = 1. However,\nthere exists another fibre A\u2032 passing through a singular point of C, for which\nwe have C * A\u2032 \u2265 2. This is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nThe following lemma is a consequence of Theorem 1 in [8].\nLemma 2.11 Let X be a symplectic filling of the link of a simple singularity.\nThen pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curves in X are mutually disjoint.\nProof. Suppose that there are two pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curves E and E \u2032\nwhich intersect each other. Contract E to get a symplectic manifold \u03c0 : X \u2192\nX \u2032 . Then the homology class \u03c0\u2217 [E \u2032 ] has nonnegative self-intersection number.\nNote that X \u2032 is also a symplectic filling of \u2202X. This contradicts the fact that\nany symplectic filling of the link of a simple singularity has negative definite\nintersection form (Theorem 1 in [8]).\n\u0003\nRemark 2.12 In Lemma 2.5, Lemma 2.6 and Lemma 2.7, we showed the nonexistence of higher genus pseudoholomorphic curves in the complement of a\ncertain divisor D. These arguments also imply the non-existence of a cycle of\npseudoholomorphic spheres in the complement of D. Indeed, a cycle of pseudoholomorphic spheres is a stable map of genus 1. By gluing the adjacent components around the nodes we get an irreducible symplectically embedded surface\nof genus 1 which is pseudoholomorphic with respect to a compatible almost complex structure which coincides the original almost complex structure outside of\na neighbourhood of the nodes. But Lemma 2.5, Lemma 2.6 and Lemma 2.7\nprohibit the existence of such a pseudoholomorphic curve of genus 1.\nRemark 2.13 In [9], we used the fact that the canonical bundles of the minimal symplectic fillings of the links of simple singularities are trivial. In the case\n5\n\n\fof types E6 , E7 and E8 , we used K3 surfaces to find an appropriate compactification. This argument is also applied to cases of types An and Dn with n small.\nFor general An and Dn , this fact was shown by Kanda. Here we note that\nin the case of An and Dn , the compactification contains a pseudoholomorphic\nrational curve A of nonnegative self-intersection number. Hence Theorem 2.1\ndue to McDuff implies that the compactification is a rational or ruled symplectic\n4-manifold. If it is ruled, the existence of a pseudoholomorphic cuspidal rational\ncurve implies that it is not irrationally ruled. Hence the compactification is a\nrational symplectic 4-manifold. Since the pseudoholomorphic cuspidal curve is\nsingular, Proposition 2.4 guarantees an almost complex structure with respect\nto which the cuspidal curve and a maximal family of (\u22121)-curves away from\nA are pseudoholomorphic. By Lemma 4.1 in [9], the cuspidal curve becomes\npseudoholomorphic after blowing down. Since we know the final picture, we\ncan conclude that the canonical bundle of the complement of the compactifying\ndivisor is trivial.\n\n3\n\nQuotient singularities\n\nWe consider germs of quotient singularities (C2 /G, 0), where G is a finite subgroup of Gl(2, C). It is known that every such quotient singularity is isomorphic\nto the quotient of C2 by a small group G < Gl(2, C), where \"small\" means that\nG does not contain any reflections. Also, it is known that, for small groups\nG1 , G2 , the singularity (C2 /G1 , 0) is analytically isomorphic to (C2 /G2 , 0) if\nand only if G1 is conjugate to G2 . Hence the problem of classifying quotient\nsingularities (C2 /G, 0) is reduced to the problem of classifying small subgroups\nof Gl(2, C) up to conjugation. Since G is finite, we may assume that G \u2282 U (2).\nThe action of G on C2 lifts to an action on the blow-up of C2 at the origin:\nb 2 \u2192 C2 . The exceptional divisor E is stable under the G action which is inp: C\nduced by G \u2282 U (2) \u2192 P U (2) \u223c\n= SO(3). The image of G in SO(3) is (conjugate\nto) either a cyclic subgroup, a dihedral subgroup, the tetrahedral subgroup, the\nb 2 /G has\noctahedral subgroup or the icosahedral subgroup. The quotient space C\nG\nisolated singularities at p(E ). Each of them is a cyclic quotient singularity.\nThe end result of this is in [2]. Briefly, quotient singularities can be divided\ninto five families, namely: cyclic quotient singularities, dihedral singularities,\ntetrahedral singularities, octahedral singularities and icosahedral singularities.\nPresently, we describe the possible minimal resolutions that occur for quotient\nsingularities together with compactifying divisors which are convenient from\nour point of view. The latter can be obtained by the method of McCarthy and\nWolfson [5].\n1.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that X is minimal, that is, X does not\ncontain any symplectically embedded spheres of self-intersection number \u22121.\nDenote by Y a regular neighbourhood of the compactifying divisor K presented\nin Section 3. We may take Y so that Y is a strong concave filling of \u2202Y \u223c\n= \u2202X\n(see [1], [10]). Gluing X and Y , we get a closed symplectic manifold Z. The classification problem of symplectic fillings reduces to the symplectic deformation\nclassification of the pair (Z, K).\n8\n\n\fTable 1: Dual resolution graphs and compactifying divisors for tetrahedral singularities.\nDual resolution graph\nCompactifying divisor\n\u22122\n\nb\u22123\n\nm = 6(b \u2212 2) + 1\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n\u2212b\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\nb\u22123\n\u22122\n\nm = 6(b \u2212 2) + 3\n\n\u22122\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n\u2212b\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\nb\u22123\n\nm = 6(b \u2212 2) + 5\n\u22123\n\n4.1\n\n\u2212b\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\nCyclic quotient singularities\n\nLet L, C1 , . . . , Ck be a string of symplectically embedded 2-spheres in a closed\nsymplectic 4-manifold M with L * L = 1, Ci * Ci = vi (i = 1, . . . , k). Note that\nv1 \u2264 0 and vi < 0 (i = 2, . . . , k). The main examples are the compactifying\ndivisors for cyclic quotient singularities given in Section 3. Note also that M is\na blow-up of CP 2 by Theorem 2.1. Firstly, we show the following.\nLemma 4.1 Let J be a compatible (or tame) almost complex structure for\nwhich L, C1 . . . , Ck are pseudoholomorphic. Then there exists at least one Jholomorphic (\u22121)-curve in M \\ L.\nProof. If one of the Ci (i \u2265 2) is a symplectic (\u22121)-curve, there is nothing to\nprove. Suppose that none of the Ci (i \u2265 2) are symplectic (\u22121)-curves. Since\nv1 \u2264 0, M is not minimal. So there are symplectic (\u22121)-curves in M \\ L.\nAfter blowing them down we get the complex projective plane. Denote by E a\nsymplectic (\u22121)-curve in M \\ L. If the homology class [E] is represented by a\nJ-holomorphic sphere, we are done. Suppose that [E] is not represented by a\nJ-holomorphic sphere. Pick a sequence of compatible almost complex structures\nJn such that L is Jn -holomorphic, [E] is represented by a Jn -holomorphic sphere\nEn and {Jn } converges to J.

If Aj is a multiply covered component,\ntake the underlying reduced curve E \u2032 . Then Lemma 2.5 implies that Aj or E \u2032\nis an embedded pseudoholomorphic sphere.

In fact, by successive blowing down, the compactifying divisor is\nreduced to two complex projective lines in the complex projective plane as\nLisca claimed in [3]. Here we give a proof based on Lemma 4.1 for the sake of\ncompleteness.\nWe call a configuration D = L \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck of rational curves admissible\n(for symplectic fillings of links of cyclic quotient singularities) if it is the total\ntransform of two distinct lines in CP 2 under some iterated blow-up. Suppose\nthat M \\ (L \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck ) is minimal. Denote by JD the set of compatible almost complex structures with respect to which D = L \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck is\npseudoholomorphic. We will blow down a maximal family {Ei } of pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curves in M \\ L to reduce the configuration of rational curves to\nan admissible configuration. Note that these (\u22121)-curves are mutually disjoint\n(Lemma 2.8).\nProposition 4.2 Let J be a compatible almost complex structure, which is\ngeneric in JD . Denote by M \u2032 the symplectic 4-manifold obtained by blowing\ndown all J-holomorphic (\u22121)-curves {Ej } away from L and by Ci\u2032 the image of\nCi . Then {L, Ci\u2032 } is an admissible configuration for a symplectic filling of a link\nof cyclic quotient singularity.\n12\n\n\fProof. Firstly, we note that any pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curve in M \u2032 \\ L is\none of the Ci\u2032 (i \u2265 2). Indeed, assume to the contrary that there is a pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curve E in M \u2032 \\ L which is not one of the Ci\u2032 . Perturbing the\nalmost complex structure slightly, we may assume that E does not pass through\nthe images of the blown-down (\u22121)-curves Ej . Hence we may assume that E\nis actually a pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curve already in M \\ L which contradicts\nthe maximality of {Ej }.\nNext, we note that each Ci\u2032 is embedded. It is enough to show that each Ej\nintersects exactly one of Ci with Ej * Ci = 1. Perturbing the almost complex\nstructure away from D, we may assume that Ej intersects any Ci transversally.\nSuppose that Ej intersects Ci such that Ej * Ci \u2265 2. After contracting Ej ,\nCi becomes a nodal curve, which is singular. The existence of such a curve is\nprohibited by Lemma 2.5. Similarly, Lemma 2.5 and Remark 2.12 exclude the\npossibility that Ej intersects at least two of the Ci 's.\nThus Lemma 4.1 implies that one of the Ci\u2032 is a symplectic (\u22121)-curve. After\n\u2032\u2032\nblowing it down, we get a new configuration of rational curves L\u222aC1\u2032\u2032 \u222a* * *\u222aCk\u22121\n.\n\u2032\u2032\nLet M denote the resulting ambient symplectic 4-manifold.\nWe claim that there are no symplectic (\u22121)-curves in M \u2032\u2032 \\ L except for\nsome of the Ci\u2032\u2032 . Suppose that E is such a pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curve. A\nsimilar argument as above shows that E can be lifted to a pseudoholomorphic\n(\u22121)-curve in M \\ L. This contradicts the maximality of {Ej }.\nContinuing this process, we can successively blow down (\u22121)-curves to get\nthe complex projective plane and C1 transformed to a complex projective line\nL\u2032 transversal to L. The other Ci are contracted to a point on L\u2032 .\n\u0003\n\n4.2\n\nDihedral singularities\n\nf be a closed symplectic 4-manifold containing a configuration of symplecLet M\ntically embedded 2-spheres intersecting in the manner shown in the first picture\nin Figure 1. Here c, ci \u2265 2, i = 1, . . . , k. By a sequence of blow-downs and a\nblow-up, as in [9] in the simple dihedral case, we can transform this configuration into a configuration containing a cusp curve (see Figure 1). Let M denote\nthe resulting ambient manifold.\nTo obtain a classification of fillings of links of dihedral singularities we proceed via a process of blowing down symplectic (\u22121)-curves in M . Using the\nresults of [9], we know that the complement of a regular neighbourhood of the\nunion of the 0-curve A and the cusp curve D, in the final picture in Figure 1,\ngives a symplectic filling of the link of the simple dihedral singularity Dc+1 .\nWhen c = 2, D3 = A3 and the argument for simple dihedral singularities also\nf, is in fact rational.\nworks for the A3 -singularity. It follows that M , and hence M\nConsider now, generally, a closed symplectic 4-manifold Z containing a configuration of rational curves D = A \u222a D \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck as depicted in Figure 2.\nHere D is a singular curve with a (2, 3)-cusp, A is an embedded 0-curve intersecting D at the cusp point and C1 , . . .

Let J be a compatible almost complex structure for which A, D, C1 , . . . , Ck are pseudoholomorphic. Then C1 is a (\u22121)-curve or there exists a J-holomorphic (\u22121)-curve\nin Z \\ (A \u222a D).\nProof. First suppose that the complement of A\u222aD is minimal. If D*D \u2264 5, then\nwe know from [9] that the anti-canonical class of Z is represented by D. Since\nC1 *D = 1 it follows that C1 is a (\u22121)-curve. If D *D \u2265 6, then, after blowing up\n3 points on the smooth part of D, away from C1 , denote the proper transform\ne the blow up of Z by Z\ne and the exceptional curves by e1 , e2 , e3 . Then\nof D by D,\ne\ne\ne is minimal then C1 is a (\u22121)-curve and\nD * D \u2264 5. If the complement of A \u222a D\ne \\ (A \u222a D),\ne then we claim that\nwe are done. If there exists a (\u22121)-curve E in Z\nE is disjoint from the exceptional curves e1 , e2 , e3 . To see this, note that, by\ne e1 , e2 , e3 , E are pseudoholomorphic\nProposition 2.4, we may assume that A, D,\ne Suppose that\nwith respect to some compatible almost complex structure J.\nE * ei \u2265 1 for some i. Then, after blowing down E, the image of ei is either a\ne once only, contradicting\nsingular pseudoholomorphic curve which intersects D\ne once\nLemma 2.7, or is an embedded pseudoholomorphic 0-curve intersecting D\nonly, contradicting Lemma 2.10. Thus E exists as a symplectic (\u22121)-curve in\nZ \\ (A \u222a D), contradicting the minimality of the latter. Thus this case does not\noccur.\nSuppose now that Z \\ (A\u222aD) is not minimal. Then there exists a symplectic\n(\u22121)-curve E in Z \\ (A \u222a D). If [E] is represented by a J-holomorphic curve,\nwe are done. If [E] can not be represented by a J-holomorphic curve, then pick\na sequence of tame almost complex structures Jn converging to J such that [E]\nis represented by a Jn -holomorphic curve En for each n. By the compactness\ntheorem, after taking a subsequence, En converges to the image of a stable map.\nLet A1 , . . . , Al denote the irreducible components of this stable map. Arguing\nas in the proof of Proposition 4.1 in [10], it can be shown that none of the Ai 's\ncoincides with (or multiply covers) D. Hence it also follows that none of the Ai 's\nintersects D. Note also that Aj is disjoint from A. Since c1 (Z)[E] = 1, it follows\nthat c1 (Z)[Aj ] > 0 for some j. By replacing Aj by the underlying simple curve,\nif Aj is multiply-covered, assume that Aj is a simple curve. By Lemma 2.6, Aj\n15\n\n\fis an embedded J-holomorphic sphere. Also, by Lemma 2.9, Aj * Aj < 0. By\nthe adjunction formula, it now follows that Aj is a J-holomorphic (\u22121)-curve.\n\u0003\nIn general, we call a configuration of rational curves D = A \u222a D \u222a C1 \u222a\n* * * \u222a Ck as in Figure 2, in a closed symplectic 4-manifold Z, admissible (for\nsymplectic fillings of links of dihedral singularities) if it can be obtained as the\ntotal transform of an iterated blow-up of either:\n(a) a union of a cuspidal rational curve of bi-degree (2, 2) and a 0-curve intersecting only at the cusp point in the ruled surface CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 , or\n(b) a union of a singular rational curve representing the class 3CP 1 \u2212 L and a\n0-curve intersecting only at the cusp point in the one-point blow-up of CP 2 ,\nwhere L represents the exceptional curve of the blow-up.\nWe call A \u222a D \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck a pre-admissible configuration if it becomes\nadmissible after possibly blowing down some (\u22121)-curves intersecting only D.\nAssume now that M \\(A\u222aD \u222aC1 \u222a* * *\u222aCk ) is minimal. The following proposition shows that after blowing down a maximal family of pseudoholomorphic\n(\u22121)-curves in M \\ (A \u222a D) the configuration A \u222a D \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck is reduced to\na pre-admissible configuration. Note that by Lemma 2.11 these (\u22121)-curves are\nnecessarily disjoint. Note also that these (\u22121)-curves, if they are not contained\nin the string CP\n1 , . . . , Ck , can intersect it at most once, that is, for any such\n(\u22121)-curve\nE,\nE * Ci \u2264 1. Indeed, suppose that there is a (\u22121)-curve E such\nP\nthat\nE * Ci > 1, then after contracting E we get either a singular pseudoholomorphic curve or a cycle of pseudoholomorphic spheres whose intersection\nnumber with A is 0. This contradicts Lemma 2.9 and Remark 2.12. Now let JC\ndenote the set of compatible almost complex structures with respect to which\nC = A \u222a D \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck is pseudoholomorphic.\nProposition 4.4 Let J be a compatible almost complex structure which is generic\nin JC . Denote by M \u2032 the symplectic 4-manifold obtained by blowing down all\nJ-holomorphic (\u22121)-curves in M \\ (A \u222a D) and by Ci\u2032 the image of Ci . Then\n{A, D, Ci\u2032 } is a pre-admissible configuration for a symplectic fillings of a link of\na dihedral singularity.\nProof. By Lemma 4.3 there exists a (\u22121)-curve in M \u2032 \\ (A \u222a D). We claim that\nthis (\u22121)-curve must be one of the Ci\u2032 . Suppose that it is not. Then it can\nintersect only one of the Ci\u2032 at exactly one point transversally. Hence it must\nalready have been in M \\ (A \u222a D) contradicting the fact that we blew down all\nsuch (\u22121)-curves. We now blow down this curve to obtain a new configuration\n{A, D\u2032 , Ci\u2032\u2032 }. If the string {Ci\u2032\u2032 } is not empty, we can argue in a similar way\nto show that it must also contain a (\u22121)-curve. Blowing down this (\u22121)-curve\nalso and continuing in this way we can show that the whole string {Ci\u2032 } can\neventually be blown down. Thus we get the compactification of the symplectic\nfilling of the link of a simple dihedral singularity or the A3 -singularity in [9], after\nblowing up, if necessary, at most 3 points on the smooth part of the image of D.\n16\n\n\f(In [9], we dealt with the A3 -singularity as one of the An -singularities not as the\n\"D3 -singularity\". However, the argument for the dihedral case does work for\nthe D3 = A3 -case.) In fact, we can see that there are pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)curves, which intersect D once transversally. After contracting them, we get the\nconfiguration of type (a) or (b). As we have noticed before, these (\u22121)-curves\neventually exist in the original manifold M . Changing the order of the blowing\ndown processes, we find that {A, D, Ci\u2032 } is a pre-admissible configuration.\n\u0003\n\n4.3\n\nTetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral singularities\n\nFor the purposes of classification of symplectic fillings of tetrahedral, octahedral\nand icosahedral singularities, it is convenient to divide these singularities into\ntwo sets: those with a branch consisting of two (\u22122)-curves intersecting the\ncentral curve in the minimal resolution and those with a branch consisting of a\nsingle (\u22123)-curve intersecting the central curve. We designate these singularities\nas type (3, 2) singularities and type (3, 1) singularities respectively. There is\nexactly one class of quotient singularities which lies in both sets, namely the\ntetrahedral singularities T6(b\u22122)+3 .\nWe begin by discussing the classification of fillings of type (3, 2) singularities. Note that, given a singularity \u0393 of type (3, 2), we can always choose a\ncompactifying divisor such that its central curve has self-intersection number\n\u22121. Namely, if b = 2, the central curve given in Section 2 is a (\u22121)-curve. If\nb \u2265 3, we blow up the compactifying divisor given earlier at the transversal\nintersection of the central curve and the third branch, that is, the branch that\ndoes not consist of a single (\u22122)- or (\u22123)-curve (except in case \u0393 = T6(b\u22122)+1 ,\nin which case we blow up at the intersection of the central curve and one of the\n(\u22123)-curves), repeatedly until the self-intersection number of the central curve\nf be a closed symplectic 4-manifold containing a\nhas dropped to \u22121. Now let M\nconfiguration of symplectically embedded 2-spheres intersecting in the manner\nshown in the first picture in Figure 3. Here a \u2265 1 and ci \u2265 2 for i = 1, . . . , k.\nNote that a = 1, when b \u2265 3. When b = 2, 2 \u2264 a \u2264 5 (see Tables 1, 2, 3).\nIt will be convenient to transform this configuration of symplectically embedded 2-spheres into one containing a cusp curve. We achieve this by a sequence\nof blow-downs, as in the cases E6 , E7 , E8 in [9] (see Figure 3). Let M denote\nthe resulting closed symplectic 4-manifold, D the cusp curve and C1 , . . . , Ck\nthe string of curves attached to D. As the self-intersection number of the cusp\ncurve D is always positive, we can immediately conclude, by the main theorem\nf, is a rational symplectic manifold.\nin [10], that M , and hence M\nConsider now, generally, a closed symplectic 4-manifold Z containing a configuration of rational curves D = D \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck as depicted in Figure 4. Here\nD is a singular curve with a (2, 3)-cusp and C1 , . . . Ck are embedded curves. By\n[10], D * D \u2264 9.

Suppose that the complement of D is minimal and D * D \u2264 5. Then,\nfrom [9], we know that an anti-canonical divisor is given by D. It follows that\nC1 is a (\u22121)-curve. The remainder of the proof proceeds in a similar way to the\nproof of Lemma 4.3.\n\u0003\nIn general, we call a configuration of rational curves D = D \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck\nas in Figure 4, in a closed symplectic 4-manifold Z, admissible (for symplectic\nfillings of links of tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral singularities of type\n(3, 2)) if it can be obtained as the total transform of an iterated blow-up of\nthe cuspidal cubic curve in CP 2 , or of the cuspidal curve of bi-degree (2, 2)\nin CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 . In [9], we can always blow down a maximal family of (\u22121)curves to get a cuspidal cubic curve in CP 2 . In fact, if b2 (M ) \u2265 3, one can\nalso contract another maximal family of (\u22121)-curves to get CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 . In\nour present situation, we do not blow down (\u22121)-curves intersecting both D\nand some Ci . Hence we may not arrive at CP 2 but at CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 . Again, we\ncall such a configuration pre-admissible if it becomes admissible after possibly\nblowing down some (\u22121)-curves intersecting only D.\nNow assume that M \\(D\u222aC1 \u222a* * *\u222aCk ) is minimal. The following proposition\nshows that after blowing down a maximal family of pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)curves in M \\D the configuration D \u222aC1 \u222a* * *\u222aCk is reduced to a pre-admissible\nconfiguration. By Lemma 2.11, these (\u22121)-curves are necessarily disjoint. Also,\nthese (\u22121)-curves, if they are not contained in the string C1 , . . . , Ck , can intersect itPat most once. Indeed, suppose that there is such a (\u22121)-curve E such\nthat\nE * Ci \u2265 2, then, after contracting E, the image of all the curves Ci\ncontains a singular pseudoholomorphic curve or a cycle of pseudoholomorphic\nspheres. This contradicts Lemma 2.6, Lemma 2.7 or Remark 2.12, thus proving the assertion. (Note that for type (3, 2) singularities \u0393 for which the string\nC1 , . . . , Ck is nonempty, the self-intersection number D * D \u2265 3.) In summary,\nafter contracting such a pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curve, we again get a configuration consisting of D and a string of embedded spheres. We can prove the\nfollowing proposition in a similar way to the proof Proposition 4.4. Let JC\ndenote the set of compatible almost complex structures with respect to which\n19\n\n\fC = D \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck is pseudoholomorphic.\nProposition 4.6 Let J be a compatible almost complex structure which is generic\nin JC . Denote by M \u2032 the symplectic 4-manifold obtained by blowing down all\nJ-holomorphic (\u22121)-curves in M \\ D and by Ci\u2032 the image of Ci . Then {D, Ci\u2032 }\nis a pre-admissible configuration for a symplectic filling of a link of a tetrahedral,\noctahedral or icosahedral singularity of type (3, 2).\nWe now turn to the classification of fillings of type (3, 1) singularities. Again,\ngiven a singularity \u0393 of type (3, 1), as in the case of type (3, 2) singularities,\nwe can always choose a compactifying divisor whose central curve has selfintersection number \u22121. Namely, as before, when b \u2265 3, we blow up the\ncompactifying divisor given earlier at the transversal intersection of the central curve and the third branch, that is, the branch that does not consist of one\nor two (\u22122)-curves (except in case \u0393 = T6(b\u22122)+5 , in which case we blow up\nat the intersection of the central curve and one of the branches consisting of 2\n(\u22122)-curves), repeatedly until the self-intersection number of the central curve\nf be a closed symplectic 4-manifold containing a\nhas dropped to \u22121. Now let M\nconfiguration of symplectically embedded 2-spheres intersecting in the manner\nshown in the first picture in Figure 5. Here a \u2265 1 and ci \u2265 2 for i = 1, . . . , k.\nAgain it will be convenient to transform this configuration of symplectically\nembedded 2-spheres into one containing a cusp curve. We achieve this by a\nsequence of blow-downs and a blow-up (see Figure 5). Let M denote the resulting closed symplectic 4-manifold, D the cuspidal curve, A the 0-curve, B the\n(\u22121)-curve and C1 , . . . , Ck the string of curves intersecting D. Since the complement of a regular neighbourhood of A \u222a D is a symplectic filling of a simple\ndihedral singularity or A3 , it follows, by the results of [9], that M , and hence\nf, is a rational symplectic 4-manifold. Note that A3 can be also treated as a\nM\nsimple dihedral singularity \"D3 \". Let JC denote the set of compatible almost\ncomplex structures with respect to which C = A \u222a B \u222a D \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck is\npseudoholomorphic.\nLemma 4.7 Let J be generic in JC . Then there exists a J-holomorphic (\u22121)curve E in M \\ (A \u222a D) such that B * E = 1. Moreover, such a curve E is\nunique.\nProof. Let JD denote the set of compatible almost complex structures with respect to which D = A\u222aB \u222aD is pseudoholomorphic. By Proposition 2.4 applied\nto the curves A \u222a B \u222a D, for a generic almost complex structure J \u2032 \u2208 JD , any\nsymplectic (\u22121)-curve in M has a unique J \u2032 -holomorphic representative. In particular, for any maximal disjoint family E1 , . . . , EN of symplectic (\u22121)-curves\nin the complement of A \u222a D, we have a unique family of J \u2032 -holomorphic rep\u2032\nresentatives E1\u2032 , . . . , EN\n. It follows,\nby the results of [9], that an anti-canonical\nP\ndivisor of M is given by D \u2212 Ei\u2032 . Now since c1 (M )[B] = 1 and B * D = 2, it\nfollows that there is exactly one Ei\u2032 such that B * Ei\u2032 = 1 and B * Ej\u2032 = 0 if j 6= i.\nAssume, without loss of generality, that B * E1\u2032 = 1.

By the compactness\ntheorem, Bn converges to the image of a stable map. Let A1 , . . . , Al denote the\nirreducible components of this stable map. By the proof of Proposition 4.1 in\n[10], no component of this stable map coincides with (or is a multiple cover of)\nD. Hence, in particular, no component can intersect D. Since [B] * [E1\u2032 ] = 1,\nthere is a component Ai such that Ai * B = 1. It follows that Ai is a simple curve. Since Ai is disjoint from D, by Lemma 2.9, Ai is rational curve of\nnegative self intersection. Now the fact that J is generic away from the configuration C allows us to conclude that Ai is in fact a (\u22121)-curve. (The virtual\ndimension of the moduli space of singular pseudoholomorphic curves of negative self-intersection number is negative.) Taking E = Ai gives the required\nJ-holomorphic (\u22121)-curve.\nIf E and E \u2032 are pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curves such that E *B = E \u2032 *B = 1,\nthen, for a generic J \u2032 \u2208 JD , both [E] and [E \u2032 ] are represented by J \u2032 -holomorphic\n(\u22121)-curves. By Lemma 2.11, they are mutually disjoint and we may assume\n\u2032\nthat E and E \u2032 are contained in {E1\u2032 , . . . , EN\n}. However, as we saw, there is\nexactly one Ei\u2032 such that B * Ei\u2032 = 1. Hence we find uniqueness, that is, E = E \u2032 .\n\u0003\nNote that E can intersect at most one of the Ci 's (see Remark 2.12). In a\nsimilar way, E * Ci = 1 if E intersects Ci . There are now two cases to consider:\nthe case where E is disjoint from the string C1 , . . . , Ck and the case where E\nintersects precisely one member of the string C1 , . . . , Ck .\nCase I: E * Ci = 0 for all i\nIn this case, blow down the (\u22121)-curve E and denote the image of B under the\nblowing down map by B \u2032 .

As in other cases, we blow down\nsome pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curves and reduce the compactifying divisor to\na standard form. For each pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curve F in the complement\nof A \u222a B \u2032 , F intersects at most one of the Cj\u2032 . Moreover their intersection number is 1. After contracting such (\u22121)-curves, C1\u2032 . . . , Ck\u2032 remain symplectically\nembedded spheres, whose dual graph is a string. The image Cj\u2032\u2032 of Cj\u2032 (j 6= i)\nis contained in the complement of A \u222a B \u2032 , hence has negative self-intersection\nnumber. Note that F may also intersect D.

Otherwise\nthe self-intersection number of D is less than 8. In each case, we find that the\ncomplement of A \u222a B is not minimal.

(Note that D necessarily intersects the string C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck\ntwice in an admissible configuration).\nAssume now that the complement of the configuration C \u2032 = A \u222a B \u2032 \u222a D \u222a\n\u2032\nC1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck\u2032 in M \u2032 is minimal and let JC \u2032 denote the set of compatible almost\n25\n\n\fB\n\n0\n\nA\n\n0\n0\n\nC\nD'\n\n8\n\nFigure 10: Arrangement of curves in CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 giving rise to admissible configurations for case II symplectic fillings of links of tetrahedral, octahedral or\nicosahedral singularities of type (3, 1)\ncomplex structures with respect to which C \u2032 is pseudoholomorphic.\nProposition 4.11 Let J be a compatible almost complex structure which is\ngeneric in JC \u2032 . Denote by M \u2032\u2032 the symplectic 4-manifold obtained by blowing\ndown all J-holomorphic (\u22121)-curves in M \u2032 \\ (A \u222a B \u2032 ), by D\u2032 the image of D and\nby Cl\u2032\u2032 the image of Cl\u2032 . Then {A, B \u2032 , D\u2032 , {Cl\u2032\u2032 }} is an admissible configuration\nfor a case II symplectic filling of a link of a tetrahedral, octahedral or icosahedral\nsingularity of type (3, 1).\nProof. Claim 1. There is a J-holomorphic (\u22121)-curve F in M \u2032 \\ (A \u222a B \u2032 ) such\nthat F * D = 1, F * Cj\u2032 = 1 for some j, F * Cl\u2032 = 0, l 6= j.\nProof of Claim 1. Suppose that there is no such curve F , then all J-holomorphic\n(\u22121)-curves in M \u2032 \\ (A \u222a B \u2032 ) are disjoint from D. After blowing down all\nsuch (\u22121)-curves, denote the image of D by D\u2032 and the image of Cl\u2032 by Cl\u2032\u2032 .\nBy Lemma 4.10, there exists a (\u22121)-curve away from A \u222a B \u2032 in the resulting\nsymplectic 4-manifold M \u2032\u2032 . Arguing as in other cases, any such (\u22121)-curve must\nbe one of the Cl\u2032\u2032 , l 6= i. After iteratively blowing down all such (\u22121)-curves\nwe arrive at the situation depicted in Figure 11. But this situation can not be\nminimal since if it were Ci\u2032\u2032\u2032 would have to be homologous to A and hence would\nhave to intersect D\u2032\u2032 twice. Hence, again by Lemma 4.10, there must be a (\u22121)curve in the resulting symplectic 4-manifold M \u2032\u2032\u2032 away from A \u222a B \u2032 . But this\n(\u22121)-curve must have already existed in M \u2032 \\ (A \u222a B \u2032 ), which is a contradiction\nsince we are assuming that we blew down all such (\u22121)-curves.\nClaim 2. Let F be as in Claim 1. Then j \u2265 i.\nProof of Claim 2. Suppose j < i, then, after blowing down all (\u22121)-curves in\nM \u2032 \\ (A \u222a B \u2032 ), let M \u2032\u2032 denote the resulting symplectic 4-manifold and denote\nby D\u2032 the image of D and by Cl\u2032\u2032 the image of Cl\u2032 . Arguing as in the proof of\nClaim 1, we can now iteratively blow down all the curves Cl\u2032\u2032 , l 6= i. Let M \u2032\u2032\u2032\ndenote the resulting symplectic 4-manifold and denote by D\u2032\u2032 the image of D\u2032 .\n\u2032\nin M \u2032\u2032 intersects D\u2032 at least twice, D\u2032\u2032\nSince the image of the string C1\u2032 , . . . , Ci\u22121\nwill have a singular point away from the cusp point. Now, after contracting a\n26\n\n\f0\n\nB'\nA\n\n0\nD''\n\nCi'''\n\nFigure 11: See Proof of Claim 1\nmaximal family of pseudoholomorphic (\u22121)-curves in M \u2032\u2032\u2032 \\(A\u222aB \u2032 ), we obtain a\n(2,2)-curve in CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 with at least two singular points, which is impossible.\nClaim 3. There is at most one such curve F as in Claim 1.\nProof of Claim 3. Suppose there is more than one such curve and denote these\n\u2032\ncurves F1 , . . . , Fs . Assume that Fl * Cj(l)\n= 1 for l = 1, . . . , s. Then, by Claim 2,\nj(l) \u2265 i for all l. First suppose that \u266f{l | j(l) > i} \u2265 2. Then after contracting all\n\u2032\n(\u22121)-curves in M \u2032 \\ (A\u222aB \u2032 ), the image of the string Ci+1\n, . . . Ck\u2032 in the resulting\n\u2032\u2032\nsymplectic 4-manifold M intersects the image of D at least twice. The proof\nis now as in the proof of Claim 2. Now suppose that \u266f{l | j(l) > i} \u2264 1. Then,\nafter contracting all (\u22121)-curves in M \u2032 \\(A\u222aB \u2032 ) and then iteratively contracting\nthe images of the curves Cl\u2032 , l 6= i, denote by M \u2032\u2032\u2032 the resulting symplectic 4manifold, by D\u2032\u2032 the image of D and by Ci\u2032\u2032\u2032 the image of Ci\u2032 (see Figure 12 for\nthe case s = 2). Note that this situation does not occur in CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 since\nCi\u2032\u2032\u2032 is a smoothly embedded rational curve which is disjoint from A and hence\nmust be homologous to A but Ci\u2032\u2032\u2032 * D\u2032\u2032 \u2265 3. Since blowing down (\u22121)-curves\naway from A \u222a B \u2032 can only increase the intersection number Ci\u2032\u2032\u2032 * D\u2032\u2032 , it follows\nthat M \u2032\u2032\u2032 can also not be a blow-up of CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 , which is absurd.\nWe prove the proposition. After contracting all (\u22121)-curves in M \u2032 \\ (A \u222a B \u2032 )\nit follows from Claim 3 that the image of the string C1\u2032 , . . . , Ck\u2032 intersects the\nimage of D exactly twice. Namely, C1\u2032\u2032 and Cj\u2032\u2032 for some j \u2265 i intersect D\u2032 .\nOne can now, using Lemma 4.10, iteratively blow down the curves Cl\u2032\u2032 , l 6= i to\nobtain the configuration given in Figure 10. This shows that the configuration\n{A, B \u2032 , D\u2032 , {Cl\u2032\u2032 }} is an admissible configuration.\n\u0003\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Section 4, we reduced the compactification to a standard configuration of\nrational curves in either CP 2 or CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 as follows.\n(1) Cyclic quotient singularities: two distinct lines in CP 2 .\n\n27\n\n\fB'\n\n0\n\nA\n\n0\n\nD'' Ci'''\n\nFigure 12: See Proof of Claim 3\n(2) Dihedral singularities: a union of a 0-curve and a cuspidal curve of bidegree (2, 2)) in CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 which intersect at the cusp point, or the proper\ntransform of a union of a line and a cuspidal cubic curve in CP 2 which meet\nat the cusp point under the blow-up of their transversal intersection point,\nthat is, another intersection point of them.\n(3) Tetrahedral, Octahedral and Icosahedral singularities of type (3, 2): a cuspidal curve of degree 3 (resp. of bi-degree (2, 2)) in CP 2 (resp. CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 ).\n(4) Tetrahedral, Octahedral and Icosahedral singularities of type (3, 1): two\nkinds of configurations appear:\n(i) a union of CP 1 \u00d7 {pt}, {pt} \u00d7 CP 1 and a cuspidal curve of bi-degree\n(2, 2), which meet at the cusp point,\n(ii) a union of CP 1 \u00d7{pt}, {pt}\u00d7CP 1 , a cuspidal curve of bi-degree (2, 2),\nwhich meet at the cusp point, and another rational curve homologous\nto CP 1 \u00d7 {pt}.\nTo recover the symplectic filling X, we first sequentially blow up the manifold at points on the total transform of the divisor in the above list to get a\nclosed symplectic 4-manifold Z. Then we get X as the complement of a regular\nneighbourhood of the compactifying divisor K in Z. For classification up to\nsymplectic deformation equivalence, we need uniqueness of symplectic deformation types of the standard configurations, which we can prove as in [9].\nIt is not difficult to see that for cyclic quotient singularities and dihedral\nsingularities we can find links with arbitrarily many nondiffeomorphic symplectic fillings. (For cyclic quotient singularities, this fact was noted by Lisca [3].)\nHowever for tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral singularities, the number\nof symplectic fillings for each class of singularities in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 is\nbounded above by a number independent of b. We give a list of all symplectic\nfillings in these cases. To aid this, for the case (4ii) above, we note the following\nconstraints:\n(a) if i > 1, then ci 6= 2,\n\n28\n\n\f(b) if j < k, then cj 6= 2,\n(c) b \u2264 max{5, cb\u22122 },\nwhere i is as in Figure 8 and j is as in the proof of Proposition 4.11. In particular, since cb\u22122 \u2264 6 for quotient singularities, there are only a finite number of\nsymplectic filling which fall into case (4ii) above.\nThe list we give below is the list of compactifications Z and compactifying\ndivisors K of minimal symplectic fillings. There may be symplectically deformation equivalent fillings in the list. To get a list of minimal symplectic fillings,\nwe should describe the contactomorphisms up to contact isotopies. We leave\nthis as a topic for future research.\nSymplectic fillings of links of Tetrahedral, Octahedral and Icosahedral singularities of type (3, 2)\nWe use the notation (m; D * D, \u2212c1 , . . . , \u2212ck ; a1 \u00d7 i1 , . . . , al \u00d7 il ) to denote the\nsymplectic filling of the link of Tm , Om or Im given as the complement of a\nregular neighbourhood of the compactifying divisor K = D \u222a C1 \u222a * * * \u222a Ck\ngiven in Figure 4. Here \u2212c1 , . . . , \u2212ck denote the self-intersections of the curves\nC1 , . . . , Ck and aj \u00d7 ij denotes the existence of aj distinct (\u22121)-curves intersecting Cij in Z. We abbreviate 1 \u00d7 ij = ij . In each case we indicate whether the\npair (Z, K) is given by blowing up (CP 2 , cuspidal cubic curve of degree 3) or\n(CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 , cuspidal curve of bi-degree (2, 2)). Note that when we blow down\nthe compactification Z of a symplectic filling of the link of a singularity of type\n(3, 2) we can always guarantee that we end up with CP 2 unless the image of D\nunder the blowing down map has self-intersection number 8. In that case we\nmay also end up with CP 1 \u00d7 CP 1 . There are 16 cases where this occurs.\nTetrahedral, Tm\n1. E6\n2. (6(3 \u2212 2) + 1; 5, \u22124; 3 \u00d7 1), CP 2\n3.
