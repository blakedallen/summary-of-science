If z is a\ncomplex number, then z can be expressed as x + y i, where x, y are real\nnumbers, called the real and imaginary parts of z, and i2 = \u22121. In this case\nthe complex conjugate of z is denoted z and defined to be x \u2212 y i.\nThese notes are connected to the \"potpourri\" topics class in the Department of Mathematics, Rice University, in the fall semester of 2004.\n\n1\n\n\fIf x is a real number, then the absolute value of x is denoted |x| and\ndefined to be equal to x when x \u2265 0 and to \u2212x when x \u2264 0. Notice that\n|x + y| \u2264 |x| + |y| and |x y| = |x| |y| for all real numbers x, y.\nIf z = x + y i is a complex number, x, y \u2208 R, then the modulus of z is\ndenoted |z| and is the nonnegative real number defined by |z|2 = z z = x2 +y 2 .\nFor every pair of complex numbers z, w we have that |z + w| \u2264 |z| + |w| and\n|z w| = |z| |w|.\n\n1\n\nNormed vector spaces\n\nLet V be a real or complex vector space. By a norm on V we mean a function\nkvk defined for all v \u2208 V such that kvk is a nonnegative real number for all\nv \u2208 V which is equal to 0 if and only if v = 0,\n(1.1)\n\nk\u03b1 vk = |\u03b1| kvk\n\nfor all real or complex numbers \u03b1, as appropriate, and all v \u2208 V , and\n(1.2)\n\nkv + wk \u2264 kvk + kwk\n\nfor all v, w \u2208 V . In this event kv \u2212 wk defines a metric on V .\nAn inner product on a real or complex vector space V is a function hv, wi\ndefined for v, w \u2208 V which takes values in the real or complex numbers,\naccording to whether V is a real or complex vector space, and which satisfies\nthe following properties. First, for each fixed w \u2208 V , hv, wi is linear as a\nfunction of v, which is to say that\n(1.3)\nfor all v, v \u2032 \u2208 V and\n(1.4)\n\nhv + v \u2032 , wi = hv, wi + hv \u2032 , wi\nh\u03b1 v, wi = \u03b1 hv, wi\n\nfor all real or complex numbers \u03b1, as appropriate, and all v \u2208 V . Second,\nhv, wi is symmetric in v, w when V is a real vector space, which means that\n(1.5)\n\nhw, vi = hv, wi\n\nfor all v, w \u2208 V , and it is Hermitian-symmetric in the complex case, which\nmeans that\nhw, vi = hv, wi\n(1.6)\n2\n\n\ffor all v, w \u2208 V . As a result, hv, wi is linear in w for each fixed v in the\nreal case, and it is conjugate-linear in the complex case. From the symmetry\ncondition it follows that hv, vi is a real number for all v \u2208 V even in the\ncomplex case, and the third condition is that\n(1.7)\n\nhv, vi \u2265 0\n\nfor all v \u2208 V , with\n(1.8)\n\nhv, vi > 0\n\nwhen v 6= 0.\nSuppose that V is a real or complex vector space with inner product\nhv, wi, and put\n(1.9)\nkvk = hv, vi1/2\nfor v \u2208 V . The Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality states that\n(1.10)\n\n|hv, wi| \u2264 kvk kwk\n\nfor all v, w \u2208 V . This can be derived using the fact that\n(1.11)\n\nhv + \u03b1w, v + \u03b1wi\n\nis a nonnegative real number for all scalars \u03b1. As a consequence, one can\ncheck that\n(1.12)\nkv + wk \u2264 kvk + kwk\nfor all v, w \u2208 V , by expanding kv + wk2 in terms of the inner product. It\nfollows that kvk defines a norm on V .\nA subset E of a vector space V is said to be convex if for each v, w \u2208 E\nand each real number t with 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1 we have that\n(1.13)\n\nt v + (1 \u2212 t) w \u2208 E.\n\nSuppose that kvk is a real-valued function on V such that kvk \u2265 0 for all\nv \u2208 V , kvk = 0 if and only if v = 0, and k\u03b1 vk = |\u03b1| kvk for all scalars \u03b1 and\nall v \u2208 V . Then kvk defines a norm on V if and only if\n(1.14)\n\n{v \u2208 V : kvk \u2264 1}\n\nis a convex subset of V . In other words, this is equivalent to the triangle\ninequality in the presence of the other conditions. This is not too difficult to\nverify.\n3\n\n\fFix a positive integer n, and consider Rn , Cn as real or complex vector\nspaces. More precisely, Rn and Cn consist of n-tuples of real or complex\nnumbers, as appropriate. If v = (v1 , . . . , vn ), w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) are elements\nof Rn or of Cn , then the sum v + w is defined coordinatewise,\n(1.15)\n\nv + w = (v1 + w1 , . . . , vn + wn ).\n\nSimilarly, if \u03b1 is a real or complex number and v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) is an element of Rn or of Cn , as appropriate, then the scalar product \u03b1 v is defined\ncoordinatewise,\n(1.16)\n\u03b1 v = (\u03b11 v1 , . . . , \u03b1n vn ).\nThe standard inner product on Rn , Cn is defined by\n(1.17)\n\nhv, wi =\n\nn\nX\n\nvj wj\n\nj=1\n\nin the real case and\n(1.18)\n\nhv, wi\n\nn\nX\n\nvj wj\n\nj=1\n\nin the complex case. If p is a real number with 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, then we put\n(1.19)\n\nkvkp =\n\n\u0012X\nn\n\n|vj |\n\nj=1\n\np\n\n\u00131/p\n\nin both the real and complex cases, and we can extend this to p = \u221e by\n(1.20)\n\nkvk\u221e = max(|v1 |, . . . , |vn |).\n\nNotice that kvk2 is the norm associated to the standard inner product on\nRn , Cn . For all p, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, one can check that kvkp defines a norm\non Rn , Cn . The triangle inequality is easy to check when p = 1, \u221e, and\nwhen 1 < p < \u221e one can show that the closed unit ball associated to kvkp\nis convex using the fact that tp is a convex function on the nonnegative real\nnumbers.\nSuppose that 1 \u2264 p, q \u2264 \u221e and that\n(1.21)\n\n1 1\n+ = 1,\np q\n4\n\n\fwith 1/\u221e = 0, in which case we say that p, q are \"conjugate exponents\". If\nv, w are elements of Rn or of Cn , then\nn\nX\n\n(1.22)\n\nvj wj \u2264 kvkp kwkq .\n\nj=1\n\nThis is H\u00f6lder's inequality.\nWhen p = q = 2 H\u00f6lder's inequality reduces to the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz\ninequality. When p, q = 1, \u221e one can check it directly using the triangle\ninequality for scalars. Now suppose that 1 < p, q < \u221e, and observe that\nab \u2264\n\n(1.23)\n\nap bq\n+\np\nq\n\nfor all nonnegative real numbers a, b, as a result of the convexity of the\nexponential function, for instance. Hence\nkvkpp kwkqq\nvj wj \u2264\n+\np\nq\nj=1\nn\nX\n\n(1.24)\n\nfor all v, w in Rn or in Cn , by applying the previous inequality to |vj wj |\nand summing over j. This yields H\u00f6lder's inequality when kvkp = 1 and\nkwkq = 1, and the general case follows from a scaling argument.\nThe triangle inequality for kvkp is known as Minkoski's inequality, and\none can also derive it from H\u00f6lder's inequality, in analogy with the p = 2\ncase. Let us restrict our attention to 1 < p < \u221e, since the p = 1, \u221e cases\ncan be handled directly. For all v, w in Rn or in Cn we have that\n(1.25)\n\nkv + wkpp \u2264\n\nn\nX\n\n|vj | |vj + wj |p\u22121 +\n\nn\nX\n\n|wj | |vj + wj |p\u22121.\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nIf q is the exponent conjugate to p, then H\u00f6lder's inequality implies that\n(1.26)\n\nkv + wkpp \u2264 (kvkp + kwkp )\n\n\u0012X\nn\n\n|vj + wj |q(p\u22121)\n\nj=1\n\nThis can be rewritten as\n(1.27)\n\nkv + wkpp \u2264 (kvkp + kwkp ) kv + wkp\u22121\np ,\n\nwhich implies that kv + wkp \u2264 kvkp + kwkp , as desired.\n5\n\n\u00131/q\n\n.\n\n\fIf v is an element of Rn or of Cn and 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, then\n(1.28)\n\nkvk\u221e \u2264 kvkp .\n\nMore generally, if 1 \u2264 p \u2264 q < \u221e, then\n(1.29)\n\nkvkq \u2264 kvkp .\n\nIndeed,\n(1.30)\n\nkvkqq =\n\nn\nX\n\nq\u2212p\n|vj |q \u2264 kvk\u221e\nkvkpp \u2264 kvkqp .\n\nj=1\n\nOf course\n(1.31)\n\nkvkp \u2264 n1/p kvk\u221e\n\nfor all v in Rn or Cn and 1 \u2264 p < \u221e. For 1 \u2264 p \u2264 q < \u221e one can check that\n(1.32)\n\nkvkp \u2264 n(1/p)\u2212(1/q) kvkq\n\nusing H\u00f6lder's inequality.\nIf V is a real or complex vector space and kvk is a norm on V , then\n(1.33)\n\nkvk \u2264 kwk + kv \u2212 wk\n\nand\n(1.34)\n\nkwk \u2264 kvk + kv \u2212 wk\n\nfor all v, w \u2208 V , by the triangle inequality. Therefore\n(1.35)\n\nkvk \u2212 kwk \u2264 kv \u2212 wk\n\nfor all v, w \u2208 V . In particular, kvk is continuous on V as a real-valued\nfunction with respect to the metric associated to the norm on V .\nIf V is Rn or Cn , then it is easy to see that kvk is bounded by a constant\ntimes the standard Euclidean norm kvk2 , by expressing v as a linear combination of the standard basis vectors. It follows that kvk is continuous as a\nreal-valued function with respect to the usual Euclidean topology on Rn or\nCn . By standard results from advanced calculus, the minimum of kvk over\nthe set of v's such that kvk2 = 1 is attained, since the latter is compact, and\nof course the minimum is positive because kvk > 0 when v 6= 0. This implies\nthat kvk is also greater than or equal to a positive constant times kvk2. As\na consequence, the topology determined by the metric kv \u2212 wk is the same\nas the standard Euclidean topology on Rn , Cn , as appropriate.\n6\n\n\f2\n\nSeparation theorems\n\nFix a positive integer n, and let E be a nonempty closed convex subset of\nRn . Also let p be a point in Rn which is not in E. There exists a point q \u2208 E\nsuch that the Euclidean distance kp \u2212 qk2 from p to q is as small as possible.\nLet H be the affine hyperplane through q which is orthogonal to p \u2212 q.\nIn other words, using the standard inner product on Rn , H consists of the\nv \u2208 Rn such that the inner product of v \u2212 q with p \u2212 q is equal to 0.\nIf x is any element of E, then x lies in the closed half-space in Rn which\nis bounded by H and which does not contain p. This is equivalent to saying\nthat the inner product of x \u2212 q with p \u2212 q is less than or equal to 0, while\nthe inner product of p \u2212 q with itself is equal to kp \u2212 qk22 > 0. One can see\nthis through a simple geometric argument, to the effect that if x \u2208 E lies in\nthe open half-space in Rn containing p, then there is a point along the line\nsegment joining x to q which is closer to p than q is.\nIt follows that in fact E is equal to the intersection of the closed halfspaces containing it. Namely, each point in Rn which is not in E is also in\nthe complement of one of the closed half-spaces containing E.\nRemark 2.1 The use of the Euclidean norm here may seem a bit strange,\nsince the statement that q \u2208 E and H is a hyperplane through q such that\nE is contained in a closed half-space in Rn bounded by H and p is in the\ncomplementary open half-space bounded by H does not require the Euclidean\nnorm or inner product. One could just as well use a different inner product\non Rn , which could lead to a different choice of q and H. Observe however\nthat if q and H the properties just mentioned, then there is an inner product\non Rn such that the distance from q to p in the corresponding norm is as\nsmall as possible and H is the hyperplane through q which is orthogonal to\nq \u2212 p.\nNext suppose that E is a closed convex subset of Rn and that p is a\npoint in the boundary of E. Thus p \u2208 E and there is a sequence of points\nn\n{pj }\u221e\nj=1 in R \\E which converges to p. In this case there is a hyperplane H\nin Rn which passes through p such that E is contained in one of the closed\nhalf-spaces bounded by H. We can reformulate this by saying that there is\na vector v \u2208 Rn such that kvk2 = 1 and for each x \u2208 E we have that the\ninner product of x \u2212 p with v is greater than or equal to 0. From the previous\nargument we know that for each j there is a point qj \u2208 E such that kqj \u2212pj k2\n7\n\n\fis as small as possible and for each x \u2208 E the inner product of x \u2212 qj with\nqj \u2212 p is greater than or equal to 0.\nPut vj = (qj \u2212p)/kqj \u2212pk2 , so that kvj k2 = 1 for all j by construction. By\npassing to a subsequence if necessary we may assume that {vj }\u221e\nj=1 converges\nto a vector v \u2208 Rn such that kvk2 = 1. It is easy to check that v has the\nrequired properties, since {qj }\u221e\nj=1 converges to p.\nNow let C be a closed convex cone in Rn , which means that C is a closed\nsubset of Rn , 0 \u2208 C, for each v \u2208 C and positive real number t we have that\nt v \u2208 C, and for each v, w \u2208 C we have that v + w \u2208 C. Suppose that z is\na point in Rn which is not in C, so that t z is not in C for any positive real\nnumber t. Let us check that there is a hyperplane in Rn which passes through\n0 such that C is contained in one of the closed half-spaces in Rn bounded by\nH and z is contained in the complementary open half-space bounded by H.\nThis is equivalent to saying that there is a vector v \u2208 Rn such that kvk2 = 1,\nthe inner product of v with any element of C is greater than or equal to 0,\nand the inner product of v with z is strictly less than 0.\nFrom the earlier arguments there is a q \u2208 C such that for any x \u2208 C\nthe inner product of x \u2212 q with q \u2212 z is greater than or equal to 0. Put\nv = (q \u2212 z)/kq \u2212 zk2 , so that kvk2 = 1 automatically and the inner product\nof x \u2212 q with v is greater than or equal to 0 for all x \u2208 C. Because 0 and\n2 q are elements of C, we have that the inner product of \u2212q, q with v are\ngreater than or equal to 0, which is to say that the inner product of q with v\nis actually equal to 0. Thus the inner product of any x \u2208 C with v is greater\nthan or equal to 0, and the inner product of z with v is negative is equal to\nthe inner product of z \u2212 q with v, which is \u2212kz \u2212 qk2 < 0.\n\n3\n\nDual spaces\n\nLet V be a finite-dimensional real or complex vector space, and let V \u2217 denote\nthe corresponding dual vector space of linear functionals on V . Thus the\nelements of V \u2217 are linear mappings from V into the real or complex numbers,\nas appropriate. If V is a real or complex vector space, then V \u2217 is too, because\none can add linear functionals and multiply them by scalars.\nSuppose that the dimension of V is equal to n, and that v1 , . . . , vn is a\nbasis for V . Thus every element of V can be expressed in a unique manner as\na linear combination of the vj 's. If \u03bb \u2208 V \u2217 , then \u03bb is uniquely determined by\nthe n scalars \u03bb(v1 ), . . . , \u03bb(vn ), and these scalars may be chosen freely. Thus\n8\n\n\fV \u2217 also has dimension equal to n.\nSuppose that V is equipped with a norm kvk. If \u03bb is a linear functional\non V , then there is a nonnegative real number k such that\n(3.1)\n\n|\u03bb(v)| \u2264 k kvk\n\nfor all v \u2208 V . To see this, one might as well assume that V is equal to Rn or\nCn , using a basis for V to get an isomorphism with Rn or Cn . As we have\nseen, any norm on Rn or Cn is equivalent to the standard Euclidean norm,\nin the sense that each is bounded by a constant multiple of the other. The\nexistence of an k \u2265 0 as above then follows from the corresponding statement\nfor the Euclidean norm.\nLet us define the dual norm of a linear functional \u03bb on V associated to\nthe norm kvk on V by\n(3.2)\nEquivalently,\n(3.3)\n\nk\u03bbk\u2217 = sup{|\u03bb(v)| : v \u2208 V, kvk \u2264}.\n|\u03bb(v)| \u2264 k\u03bbk\u2217 kvk\n\nfor all v \u2208 V , and k\u03bbk\u2217 is the smallest nonnegative real number with this\nproperty. One can check that k\u03bbk\u2217 does indeed define a norm on V \u2217 .\nFor instance, suppose that V is equipped with an inner product hv, wi.\nFor each w \u2208 V ,\n(3.4)\n\u03bbw (v) = hv, wi\ndefines a linear functional on V , and in fact every linear functional on V\narises in this manner. With respect to the norm on V associated to the inner\nproduct, the dual norm of \u03bbw is less than or equal to the norm of w, by the\nCauchy\u2013Schwartz inequality. By choosing v = w one can check that the dual\nnorm of \u03bbw is equal to the norm of w.\nNow suppose that V is Rn or Cn , and for each w in Rn or Cn , as appropriate, consider the linear functional \u03bbw on V given by\n(3.5)\n\n\u03bbw (v) =\n\nn\nX\n\nvj wj ,\n\nj=1\n\nv = (v1 , . . . , vn ), w = (w1 , . . . , wn ). Every linear functional on V arises in this\nmanner. If V is equipped with the norm kvkp from Section 1, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e,\nthen the dual norm of \u03bbw is equal to kwkq , where q is the exponent conjugate\n9\n\n\fto p. Indeed, the dual norm of \u03bbw is less than or equal to kwkq by H\u00f6lder's\ninequality. Conversely, one can show that the dual norm of \u03bbw is greater\nthan or equal to kwkq through specific choices of v.\nIf V is any finite-dimensional real or complex vector space equipped with\na norm k * k, and if v is any vector in V , then\n(3.6)\n\n|\u03bb(v)| \u2264 k\u03bbk\u2217 kvk,\n\njust by the definition of the dual norm. It turns out that for each nonzero\nvector v \u2208 V there is a linear functional \u03bb on V such that k\u03bbk\u2217 = 1 and\n\u03bb(v) = kvk. To see this we may as well assume that kvk = 1, by scaling.\nAssume first that V is a real vector space, which we may as well take to\nbe Rn . The closed unit ball in Rn associated to k * k, consisting of vectors\nwith norm less than or equal to 1, is a compact convex subset of Rn , and v\nlies in the boundary of this convex set, since kvk = 1. As in Section 2, there\nis a hyperplane H through v such that the closed unit ball associated to the\nnorm is contained in one of the closed half-spaces bounded by H. The linear\nfunctional \u03bb on Rn that we want is characterized by\n(3.7)\n\nH = {x \u2208 Rn : \u03bb(x) = 1}.\n\nNow suppose that V is a complex vector space. If \u03bb is a linear mapping\nfrom V to the complex numbers, then the real part of \u03bb is a real-linear\nmapping from V into the real numbers, i.e., it is a linear functional on V as\na real vector space, without the additional structure of scalar multiplication\nby i. Conversely, if one starts with a real-linear mapping from V into the\nreal numbers, then that is the real part of a unique complex-linear mapping\nfrom V into the complex numbers, as one can verify.\nIf \u03b2 is any complex number, then the modulus of \u03b2 can be described as the\nsupremum of the real part of \u03b1 \u03b2, where \u03b1 runs through all complex numbers\nwith |\u03b1| \u2264 1. As a result, if V is a complex vector space, k * k is a norm on\nV , and \u03bb is a complex linear functional on V , then the dual norm of \u03bb can be\ndescribed equivalently as the supremum of the real part of \u03b1 \u03bb(z) as \u03b1 runs\nthrough all complex numbers with |\u03b1| \u2264 1 and z runs through all vectors in\nV with kzk \u2264 1. Hence the dual norm of \u03bb is equal to the supremum of the\nreal part of \u03bb(z) as z runs through all vectors in V with kzk \u2264 1, because\none can absorb the scalar factors into z. In other words, the norm of \u03bb as a\ncomplex linear functional on V is equal to the norm of the real part of \u03bb as a\nreal linear functional on V , using the same norm on V . This permits one to\n10\n\n\fderive the complex case of the statement under consideration from the real\ncase.\n\n4\n\nQuotient spaces, norms\n\nLet V be a finite-dimensional real or complex vector space, and let W be a\nlinear subspace of V . Consider the quotient space V /W , which is basically\ndefined by identifying points in V whose difference lies in W . There is a\ncanonical quotient mapping q, which is a linear mapping from V onto W .\nSuppose also that V is equipped with a norm kvk. Thus we get a metric\nassociated to this norm, and with respect to this metric W is a closed subset\nof V . Indeed, in Rn or Cn , every linear subspace is a closed subset. The\ngeneral case can be derived from this one because V is isomorphic to Rn or\nCn for some n, and the norm on V is equivalent to the usual Euclidean norm\non Rn or Cn , as appropriate, with respect to this isomorphism.\nLet us define a quotient norm k * kV /W on V /W by saying that the norm\nof a point in V /W is equal to the infimum of the norms of the points in\nV which are identified to that point in the quotient. Equivalently, for each\nx \u2208 V , the norm of q(x) in V /W is equal to the infimum of the norms of\nx + w in V over w \u2208 W . In particular, kq(x)kV /W \u2264 kxk for all x \u2208 V . It\nis not difficult to check that this does indeed define a norm on the quotient\nspace V /W .\nNow let Z be a linear subspace of V , and suppose that \u03bb is a linear\nfunctional on Z. We would like to extend \u03bb to a linear functional on V\nwhose dual norm on V is the same as that of \u03bb on Z, using the restriction\nof the given norm on V to Z as a norm on Z. We may as well assume that\n\u03bb is not the zero linear functional, which is to say that \u03bb(z) 6= 0 for at least\nsome z \u2208 Z. Let W denote the kernel of \u03bb, which is the linear subspace of\nZ consisting of all vectors y \u2208 Z such that \u03bb(y) = 0.\nLet us work in the quotient space V /W . The quotient Z/W is a onedimensional subspace of V /W . Because W is the kernel of \u03bb, there is a\ncanonical linear functional on Z/W induced by \u03bb. One can check that the\nnorm of this linear functional on Z/W , associated to the quotient norm on\nZ/W obtained from our original norm k * k on V , is equal to the norm of \u03bb\nas a linear functional on Z.\nBecause Z/W has dimension equal to 1, there is a linear functional \u03bc\non V /W with dual norm equal to 1 with respect to the quotient norm on\n11\n\n\fV /W such that for each element of Z/W , the absolute value or modulus\nof \u03bc applied to that element is equal to the quotient norm of that element.\nThis follows from the result discussed in Section 3, applied to V /W with\nthe dual norm. We can multiply \u03bc by a scalar to get a linear functional\non V /W whose norm is equal to the norm of \u03bb on Z and which agrees on\nZ/W with the linear functional induced there by \u03bb. The composition of this\nlinear functional on V /W with the canonical quotient mapping from V onto\nW gives a linear functional on V which extends \u03bb from Z to V and has the\nsame norm as \u03bb has on Z.\n\n5\n\nDual cones\n\nLet V be a finite-dimensional real vector space, and let C be a closed convex cone in V . To be more precise, one can use an isomorphism between V\nand Rn to define the topology on V , i.e., so that the vector space isomorphism is a homeomorphism. This topology does not depend on the choice\nof isomorphism with Rn , because every invertible linear mapping on Rn defines a homeomorphism from Rn onto itself. Thus C is a closed subset of V\nwhich contains 0 and has the property that s v + t w \u2208 V whenever s, t are\nnonnegative real numbers and v, w \u2208 C.\nLet us define C \u2217 to be the set of linear functionals \u03bb on V such that\n\u03bb(v) \u2265 0 for all v \u2208 C. One can check that C \u2217 defines a closed convex cone in\nV \u2217 . This is called the dual cone associated to C. It follows from the result in\nSection 2 for closed convex cones that C is actually equal to the set of v \u2208 V\nsuch that \u03bb(v) \u2265 0 for all \u03bb \u2208 C \u2217 .\nAs a basic example, let V be Rn for some positive integer n, and let C be\nthe closed convex cone consisting of vectors v = (v1 , . . . , vn ) such that vj \u2265 0\nfor all j. For each w \u2208 Rn , we get a linear functional \u03bbw on Rn by putting\nP\n\u03bbw (v) = nj=1 vj wj , and every linear functional on Rn arises in this manner.\nFor this cone C, the dual cone C \u2217 consists of the linear functionals \u03bbw such\nthat w \u2208 C, as one can readily verify.\nNow let W be a finite-dimensional real or complex vector space equipped\nwith an inner product hw, zi, and let V be the real vector space of linear\nmappings A from W to itself which are self-adjoint, which is to say that\nhA(w), zi is equal to hw, A(z)i for all w, z \u2208 W . A self-adjoint linear transformation A on W is said to be nonnegative if hA(w), wi is nonnegative real\nnumber for all w \u2208 W , and the nonnegative self-adjoint linear transforma12\n\n\ftions on V form a closed convex cone in the real vector space of self-adjoint\nlinear transformations on V . If T is a self-adjoint linear transformation on\nV , then we get a linear functional \u03bbT on the vector space of self-adjoint linear transformations on W by setting \u03bbT (A) equal to the trace of A \u25e6 T for\nany self-adjoint linear transformation A on W , and every linear functional\non the vector space of self-adjoint linear transformations on W arises in this\nmanner. If T is a self-adjoint linear transformation on W , then \u03bbT (A) \u2265 0\nfor all nonnegative self-adjoint linear transformations A on W if and only if\nT is nonnegative. This can be verified using the fact that a self-adjoint linear\ntransformation on W can be diagonalized in an orthonormal basis.\n\n6\n\nOperator norms\n\nLet V , W be finite-dimensional vector spaces, both real or both complex,\nand let L(V, W ) be the vector space of linear mappings from V to W . More\nprecisely, this is a real vector space if V , W are real vector spaces and it is\na complex vector space if V , W are complex vector spaces. Notice that the\ndual V \u2217 of V is the same as L(V, R) when V is a real vector space and it is\nthe same as L(V, C) when V is a complex vector space.\nSuppose that V , W are equipped with norms kvkV , kwkW . If T is a linear\nmapping from V to W , then there is a nonnegative real number k such that\n(6.1)\n\nkT (v)kW \u2264 k kvkV\n\nfor all v \u2208 V . This can be derived from the case of mappings between\nEuclidean spaces in the usual manner, and it basically amounts to saying\nthat T is continuous as a mapping from V to W with respect to the metrics\nassociated to the norms on V , W .\nWe define the operator norm of T as a linear mapping from V to W by\n(6.2)\n\nkT kop,V W = sup{kT (v)kW : v \u2208 V, kvkV \u2264 1}.\n\nEquivalently, kT kop,V W is the smallest nonnegative real number that one can\nuse as k in the preceding paragraph. It is easy to see that kT kop,V W does\nindeed define a norm on L(V, W ). In the case where W is equal to R or C,\nso that L(V, W ) is equal to V \u2217 , the operator norm reduces to the dual norm\nof a linear functional as defined in Section 3.\nAs another equivalent definition, the operator norm of T is equal to the\nsupremum of |\u03bc(T (v))| over v \u2208 V , \u03bc \u2208 W \u2217 where the V -norm of v and the\n13\n\n\fW \u2217 -norm of \u03bc are each less than or equal to 1. That |\u03bc(T (v))| is less than or\nequal to the operator norm of T for these v's and \u03bc's follows easily from the\ndefinition. The operator norm is equal to the supremum of these quantities\nbecause norms in W are detected by linear functionals as in Section 3.\nFor each linear mapping T from V to W there is an associated dual linear\nmapping T \u2217 from W \u2217 to V \u2217 , defined by saying that if \u03bc is a linear functional\non W , then T \u2217 (\u03bc) is the linear functional on V given by the composition of\n\u03bc with T . One can check that the operator norm o T \u2217 , with respect to the\ndual norms on V \u2217 , W \u2217 , is equal to the operator norm of T with respect to\nthe original norms on V , W .\nAs a special case, suppose that V is equal to Rm or Cm for some positive\ninteger m, equipped with the norm kvk1 = |v1 | + * * * + |vm |. If e1 , . . . , em are\nthe standard basis vectors for V , so that the lth component of ej is equal to\n1 when j = l and to 0 when j 6= l, then one can show that the operator norm\nof a linear mapping T from V into a normed vector space W is equal to the\nmaximum of kT (e1 )kW , . . . , kT (em )kW .\nSuppose instead that W is equal to Rn or Cn for some positive integer\nn, equipped with the norm kwk\u221e = max(|w1 |, . . . , |wn |). A linear mapping\nT from a normed vector space V into W is basically the same as a collection\n\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn of n linear functionals on V , corresponding to the n components\nof T (v) in W . The operator norm of T is then equal to the maximum of the\ndual norms of \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn with respect to the given norm on V .\n\n7\n\nTrace norms\n\nLet V , W be finite-dimensional vector spaces, both real or both complex,\nand let k * kV , k * kW be norms on V , W , respectively. Also let T be a linear\nmapping from V to W . We can express T as\n(7.1)\n\nT (v) =\n\nl\nX\n\n\u03bbj (v) wj ,\n\nj=1\n\nfor some linear functionals \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbl on V and some vectors w1 , . . . , wl in W .\nIf \u03bb \u2208 V \u2217 and w \u2208 W , then \u03bb(v) w defines a linear mapping from V to W\nwith rank 1, unless \u03bb and w are both 0 in which event the linear mapping is\n0. The operator norm of this linear mapping is equal to the product of the\ndual norm of \u03bb and the norm of w in W . If T is given as a sum as above, then\n14\n\n\ffor each j one can take the product of the dual norm of \u03bbj and the norm of\nwj in W , and the sum of these products is a nonnegative real number which\nis greater than or equal to the operator norm of T . The trace norm of T\nis denoted kT ktr,V W and defined to be the infimum of this sum of products\nover all such representations of T . It is easy to see that the trace norm does\nindeed define a norm. In particular we have that\n(7.2)\n\nkT kop,V W \u2264 kT ktr,V W\n\nby the earlier remarks, which shows that the trace norm of T is equal to 0 if\nand only if T is equal to 0. At any rate, the homogeneity and subadditivity\nof the trace norm can be derived directly from the definition.\nIf T is a linear mapping from V to W and A is a linear mapping from W\nto V , then the composition A \u25e6 T is a linear mapping from V to itself, and\nwe can take its trace tr A \u25e6 T in the usual manner. If T (v) = \u03bb(v) w for some\n\u03bb \u2208 V \u2217 and w \u2208 W , then (A \u25e6 T )(v) = \u03bb(v) A(w), and the trace of A \u25e6 T is\nequal to \u03bb(A(w)). Using this one can check that\n(7.3)\n\n| tr A \u25e6 T | \u2264 kAkop,W V kT ktr,V W\n\nfor all linear mappings A : W \u2192 V and T : V \u2192 W . One can think\nof T 7\u2192 tr A \u25e6 T as a linear functional on L(V, W ), and the dual norm of\nthis linear functional with respect to the trace norm on L(V, W ) is equal to\nkAkop,W V .\n\n8\n\nVector-valued functions\n\nLet E be a finite nonempty set. If V is a real or complex vector space, let\nus write F (E, V ) for the vector space of functions on E with values in V .\nThus F (E, R), F (E, C) denote the vector spaces of real or complex-valued\nfunctions on E.\nIf 1 \u2264 p \u2264 \u221e, let us write kf kp for the usual p-norm of a real or complexvalued function f on E, so that\n(8.1)\n\nkf kp =\n\n\u0012X\n\nx\u2208E\n\n|f (x)|\n\np\n\n\u00131/p\n\nwhen 1 \u2264 p < \u221e and\n(8.2)\n\nkf k\u221e = max{|f (x)| : x \u2208 E}.\n15\n\n\fLet V be a vector space equipped with a norm kvk, and let us extend the\np-norms to V -values functions on E by putting\n(8.3)\n\nkf kp,V =\n\n\u0012X\n\nx\u2208E\n\nkf (x)kp\n\n\u00131/p\n\nwhen 1 \u2264 p < \u221e and\n(8.4)\n\nkf k\u221e,V = max{kf (x)k : x \u2208 E},\n\nfor any V -valued function f on E. It is easy to check that these do define\nnorms on F (E, V ), using the properties of the norm kvk on V and the pnorms for scalar-valued functions.\nLet T be a linear transformation on the vector space of real or complexvalued functions on E. If V is a real or complex vector space, as appropriate,\nthen T induces a natural linear transformation on the vector space of V Valued functions on E. For instance, for each x \u2208 E and scalar-valued\nfunction f on E, T (f )(x) is a linear combination of f (y), y \u2208 E, and one can\nuse the same coefficients to define T (f ) when f is a vector-valued function.\nIn general the relationship between the operator norm of T acting on\nscalar-valued functions and the operator norm of T acting on vector-valued\nfunctions can be complicated. If V happens to be Rn or Cn equipped with a\np-norm, and if we use the p-norm for scalar valued functions on E, then the\noperator norm of T on scalar-valued functions with respect to the p-norm\nwill be the same as the operator norm of T acting on V -valued functions\nwith respect to the norm kf kp,V defined above.\nFix p, 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, and a positive integer n. Let Sn\u22121 denote the standard\nunit sphere in Rn equipped with the Euclidean norm, which is the compact\nset of vectors with Euclidean norm equal to 1. Let V be the vector space of\nreal-valued continuous functions on Sn\u22121 .\nWe can define a p-norm on V by taking the integral of the pth power of\nthe absolute value of a continuous real-valued function on Sn\u22121 , and then\ntaking the (1/p)th power of the result. Here we use the standard element of\nintegration on Sn\u22121 which is invariant under rotations, and which one may\nwish to normalize so that the total measure of the sphere is equal to 1.\nIf T is a linear transformation acting on real-valued functions on E, then\nwe get a linear transformation acting on V -valued functions as before. The\noperator norm of T acting on real-valued functions and using the p-norm on\nthem is equal to the operator norm of the associated linear transformation\n16\n\n\facting on V -valued functions using the norm kf kp,V based on the p-norm for\nfunctions on Sn\u22121 described in the preceding paragraph.\nLet L denote the linear subspace of V consisting of functions on Sn\u22121\nwhich are restrictions of linear functions from Rn , so that each function in L\nis given by the inner product of the point in the sphere with some fixed vector\nin Rn . In this way we can identify L with Rn , and the restriction of the pnorm on V to L corresponds to a constant multiple of the usual Euclidean\nnorm on Rn . Using this it follows that if T is a linear operator acting on\nreal-valued functions on E, then the operator norm of T with respect to the\np-norm on real-valued functions on E is the same as the operator norm of\nthe corresponding linear transformation acting on Rn -valued functions, using\nthe norm on Rn -valued functions obtained from the p-norm on real-valued\nfunctions and the Euclidean norm on Rn .\n\nReferences\n[BenL]\n\nY.
