S. Movahed, M.Farhang and S. Rahvar\n\nBackground radiation (CMB) observations indicates that about 70% of the total energy\nof the Universe is made by the dark energy and the rest of it is the dark matter with a\nfew percent of Baryonic matter [3, 4, 5]. The \"cosmological constant\" is a possible explanation for the acceleration of the universe [6]. This term in Einstein field equations\ncan be regarded as a fluid with the equation of state of w = \u22121. However, there are\ntwo problems with the cosmological constant, namely the fine-tuning and the cosmic\ncoincidence. In the framework of quantum field theory, the vacuum expectation value\nis 123 order of magnitude larger than the observed value of 10\u221247 GeV4 . The absence\nof a fundamental mechanism which sets the cosmological constant to zero or to a very\nsmall value is the cosmological constant problem. The second problem known as the\ncosmic coincidence, states that why are the energy densities of dark energy and dark\nmatter nearly equal today?\nThere are various solutions for this problem as the decays cosmological constant\nmodels. A non-dissipative minimally coupled scalar field, the so-called Quintessence\nmodel can play the role of this time varying cosmological constant [7, 8, 9]. The ratio\nof energy density of this field to the matter density in this model increases by the\nexpansion of the universe and after a while dark energy becomes the dominant term\nof the energy-momentum tensor. One of the features of this model is the variation of\nequation of state during the expansion of the universe. Various Quintessence models like\nk-essence [10], tachyonic matter [11], Phantom [12, 13] and Chaplygin gas [14] provide\nvarious equations of states for the dark energy [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].\nAnother approach dealing with this problem is using the modified gravity by changing the Einstein-Hilbert action. Some of models as 1/R and logarithmic models provide\nan acceleration for the universe at the present time [22]. In addition to the phenomenological modification of action, the brane cosmology also implies modification for the\ngeneral relativity on a brane embedded in an extra dimension space. Some brane world\nmodels which produce the late time acceleration have been tested using many observational experiments such as local gravity [23, 24, 25], Supernova Type Ia [22, 26, 27,\n28, 29, 30, 31, 32], angular size of compact ratio sources [33], the age measurements of\nhigh redshift objects [34], the optical gravitational lensing surveys [35], the large scale\nstructures [36], and the X-ray gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters [37, 38].\nIn some recent papers [31, 39, 40] observational constraints have been obtained\nthrough the old data of Supernova Gold sample and its combination with CMB shift\nparameter and Baryon acoustic oscillation. Recently Guo et al. have put constraints\non this model using recent SNIa data and Baryon acoustic oscillation [26]. Song et al.,\nSawichi and Carroll have separately investigated the effect of DGP on the integrated\nSachs-Wolfe and tested the validity of modified linear growth factor in the sub-horizon\nscale [41, 42]. In ref. [41] linear growth of density contrast in this model has been reviewed but some of the interesting quantity as the growth index and its behavior versus\nredshift and its dependency to the model parameter is missed.\nIn this paper we examine the effects of DGP model on the geometrical parameters\nof the universe. On the other hand we use the observational results related to the background evolution. Since the structure formation in DGP is currently well understood\non scales between a few percent of the Hubble scale and the scale radius of a typical\ndark matter halo [44], we combine those results with the linear structure formation\nof large scale in the universe. Meanwhile we concentrate our attention to the effect\nof \u03a9rc and \u03a9m as free parameters of the model on the density contrast and growth\nindex evolution. We extend the simplest growth index analytic formula given for the\nflat \u039bCDM [45] in the underlying modified gravity model. We organize this paper as\n\n\fObservational Constraints with recent Data on the DGP Modified Gravity\n\n3\n\nfollows: In Sec.1 we introduce DGP model as a self-accelerating cosmology. Its free\nparameters and modified Friedman equation which governs on the background dynamics of the universe are also investigated. In Sec.2 we study the effect of this model on\nthe comoving distance, comoving volume element, the variation of angular size by the\nredshift[46]. In Sec. 3 we put some constraints on the parameters of model by using\nthe background evolution, such as new Gold sample and Legacy Survey of Supernova\nType Ia data [47], the position of the observed acoustic angular scale on the last scattering surface, CMB shift parameter, the baryonic oscillation length scale and baryon\ngas mass fraction for the range of redshift, z \u2264 1.0. We study the linear structure\nformation in this model and compare the growth index with the observations from the\n2\u2212degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) data in Sec. 4. We also compare the\nage of the universe in this model with the age of old cosmological structures in Sec. 5.\nSec.6 contains summary and conclusion of this work.\n\n2. DGP MODIFIED GRAVITY\nOne of the simplest covariant modified-gravity models is based on the Dvali-GabadadzePorrati (DGP) brane-world model, as generalized to cosmology by Deffayet [48]. (It is\nworth noting that the original DGP model with a Minkowski brane was not introduced\nto explain acceleration \u2013 the generalization to a Friedman brane was subsequently\nfound to be self-accelerating.) In this model, gravity leaks off the 4-dimensional brane\nuniverse into the 5-dimensional bulk spacetime at large scales. Ordinary matter is\nconsidered to be localized on the brane while gravity can propagate in the bulk. At\nsmall scales, gravity is effectively bound to the brane and 4D gravity is recovered to a\ngood approximation. The action for the five-dimensional theory is:\n1\nS=\n2\u03ba25\n\nZ\n\n5\n\nd x\n\n1\n\u2212g(5) R(5) + 2\n2\u03ba4\n\np\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\np\n\n\u2212g(4) R(4) + Smatter\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the subscripts 4 and 5 denote the quantities on the brane and in the bulk,\nrespectively, \u03ba24 (\u03ba25 ) is the inverse of four(five)-dimensional reduced Planck mass, and\nSmatter is the action for matter on the brane. The solution of DGP action in FRW\nmetric provides a self-accelerating universe for the expanding phase of the universe.\nThis model can be an alternative to the cosmological constant for describing the present\nacceleration of the universe. However, DGP model suffers from the ghost instability\nthat was shown in [49, 50] though the boundary effective action formalism. On the other\nhand the existence of ghost is confirmed by explicit calculation of the spectrum of linear\nperturbations in the five-dimensional framework [51]. A solution for this problem is socalled cascading DGP model in which the unlike previous attempts, it is free of ghost\ninstabilities. In this model the 4D propagator is regulated by embedding the 3-brane\nwithin a 4-brane with their own gravity terms induced by a flat 6D bulk [52].\nComing back to the action (1), at moderate scales the induced gravity term is\nresponsible for the recovery of 4-Dimensional Einstein gravity. The transition from 4D\nto 5D behavior is governed by a crossover scale rc :\nrc \u2261\n\n\u03ba25\n.\n2\u03ba24\n\n(2)\n\nIn the weak-field gravitational field, potential behaves as r \u22121 for r \u226a rc and as r \u22122\nfor r \u226b rc . At large scale gravity is five dimensional. The energy conservation equation\n\n\f4\n\nM. S. Movahed, M.Farhang and S. Rahvar\n\nremains the same as in general relativity, but the Friedman equation is modified:\n\u03c1\u0307 + 3H(\u03c1 + p) = 0 ,\nH2 +\n\n1\nK\n\u00b1\nrc\na2\n\n(3)\n\nr\n\nH2 +\n\n8\u03c0G\nK\n\u03c1\n=\n3\na2\n\n(4)\n\nTwo given sign in equation (4) correspond to the two branches of the cosmological\nevolution. The upper sing shows a de Sitter expansion of the universe, while the lower\nsign corresponds to the self-accelerating solution without the cosmological constant.\nSo we infer the cosmological effects of the second branch of DGP model.

The lower panel of Figure 1 shows acceleration parameter for the flat\n\u039bCDM model, obviously \u03a9rc has the same role as cosmological constant.\nThe modified Friedman equation in DGP may be reinterpreted from a standard\nviewpoint. We define the effective dark energy density \u03c1ef f \u2261 3H/8\u03c0Grc .

Thus \u03c1ef f and wef f give a standard general relativistic interpretation\nof DGP expansion history, i.e., they describe the equivalent general relativity dark\nenergy model.

Now an interesting question that arises is: \"can DGP model predict dynamics of universe?\" or in\nanother word, \"what values of the model parameter to be consistent with observational\ntests?\"\nIn the forthcoming sections we will study the observational constraints on the\nmodel.\n\n2 The effect of DGP model on the geometrical parameters of universe\nThe cosmological observations are mainly affected by the background dynamics of\nuniverse.

For an\nobject with the redshift of z, using the null geodesics in the FRW metric, the comoving\ndistance is obtained as:\n\nr(z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc ) =\n\n1\nH0\n\np\n\n|\u03a9K |\n\nF\n\n\u0012\np\n\n|\u03a9K |\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\ndz \u2032\nH(z \u2032 )/H0\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n(17)\n\n\fObservational Constraints with recent Data on the DGP Modified Gravity\n\n7\n\n3\n\nr(z)\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n\n\u03a9 r = 0.10\nc\n\u03a9 r = 0.15\n\u03a9 rc = 0.20\nc\n\u03a9 r = 0.25\n\n1\n\nc\n\n0.5\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nz\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nFig. 2 Comoving distance, r(z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc ) (in unit of c/H0 ) as a function of redshift for various\nvalues of \u03a9rc .

By numerical integration of equation\n(17), the comoving distance in terms of redshift for different values of \u03a9rc is shown\nin Figure 2. Increasing the \u03a9rc results in a longer comoving distance. According to\nthis behavior, by tuning the value of \u03a9rc we may explain the Supernova Type Ia\nobservations.\n\n2.2 Angular Size\nThe apparent angular size of an object located at the cosmological distance is another\nimportant parameter that can be affected by the cosmological model during the history\nof the universe. An object with the physical size of D is related to the apparent angular\nsize of \u03b8 by:\nD = dA \u03b8\n(19)\nwhere dA = r(z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc )/(1 + z) is the angular diameter distance. The main applications of equation (19) is on the measurement of the apparent angular size of acoustic\npeak on CMB and baryonic acoustic peak at the high and low redshifts, respectively.\nBy measuring the angular size of an object in different redshifts (the so-called AlcockPaczynski test) it is possible to probe the validity of modified gravity models [46]. The\nvariation of apparent angular size \u2206\u03b8 in terms of \u2206z is given by:\n\u2206z\n= H(z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc )r(z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc )\n\u2206\u03b8\n\n(20)\n\n\fM. S.

It must be\npointed out that for other values of \u03a9rc we also assumed \u03a9K = 0.0.\n\nFigure 3 shows \u2206z/\u2206\u03b8 in terms of redshift, normalized to the case with \u03a9m = 0.0\nand flat universe \u03a9K = 0.0. The advantage of Alcock-Paczynski test is that it is\nindependent of standard candles and knowing a standard ruler such as the size of\nbaryonic acoustic peak one can use it to constrain the modified gravity model.\n\n2.3 Comoving Volume Element\nThe comoving volume element is another geometrical parameter which is used in\nnumber-count tests such as lensed quasars, galaxies, or clusters of galaxies. The comoving volume element in terms of comoving distance and Hubble parameter is given\nby:\ndV\nf (z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc ) \u2261\n= r 2 (z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc )/H(z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc ).\n(21)\ndzd\u03a9\nAccording to Figure 4, the comoving volume element becomes large for larger value of\n\u03a9rc in the flat universe.\n\n3 Observational Constraints From the Background Evolution\nIn this section we compare the SNIa Gold sample released from more recent observations [53] which have lower systematic errors than the former Gold sample data set.\nThis new catalog contains 156 Supernova type Ia. On the other hand we also take into\naccount 116 supernova Legacy Survey data which seems to be more consistent with\nWMAP observation as another SNIa observations to examine DGP model. To make\nthe acceptance interval of model free parameters more confined, we use the location\nof acoustic peak of temperature fluctuations from WMAP observation, the location of\n\n\fObservational Constraints with recent Data on the DGP Modified Gravity\n\n9\n\n2\n\u03a9 r = 0.10\nc\n\u03a9 r = 0.15\nc\n\u03a9 r = 0.20\nc\n\u03a9 r = 0.25\n\nd V / d\u03a9 dz\n\n1.5\n\nc\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nz\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFig. 4 The comoving volume element in terms of redshift for various \u03a9rc exponent.

We fixed\n\u03a9K = 0.0\n.\n\nbaryonic acoustic oscillation peak from the SDSS and baryon gas mass fraction in the\ncluster for 26 samples at redshifts less than 1 [54]. The Supernova Type Ia experiments\nprovided the main evidence of the existence of dark energy. Since 1995 two teams of\nthe High-Z Supernova Search and the Supernova Cosmology Project have discovered\nseveral type Ia supernovas at the high redshifts [16, 55]. Recently Riess et al.(2004)\nannounced the discovery of 16 type Ia supernova with the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThis new sample includes 6 of the 7 most distant (z > 1.25) type Ia supernovas. They\ndetermined the luminosity distance of these supernovas and with the previously reported algorithms, obtained a uniform 156 Gold sample of type Ia supernovas as a new\ndata set with lower systematic errors than former Gold sample data [47, 56, 57]. At the\nbeginning we compare the predictions of the DGP model with the recent SNIa Gold\nsample [53]. The observations of supernova measure essentially the apparent magnitude m including reddening, K correction, etc, which are related to the (dimensionless)\nluminosity distance, DL , of an object at redshift z through:\nm = M + 5 log DL (z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc ),\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\n\nAlso\n\n(1 + z)\nF\nDL (z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc ) = p\n|\u03a9K |\nM = M + 5 log\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\np\n\n|\u03a9K |\n\nc/H0\n1 M pc\n\n\u0013\n\nZ\n\nz\n\n0\n\ndz \u2032 H0\nH(z \u2032 )\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n+ 25.\n\nwhere M is the absolute magnitude.

For this purpose,the first\nstep is to compute the quality of the fitting through the least squared fitting quantity\n\u03c72 defined by:\n\u03c72 (M\u0304 , \u03a9m , \u03a9rc ) =\n\n2\nobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi ; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc , M\u0304 )]\n,\n2\n\u03c3i\n\nX [\u03bc\ni\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03c3i is the observational uncertainty in the distance modulus.

The parameter M\u0304 is a nuisance parameter and\nshould be marginalized (integrated out) leading to a new \u03c7\u03042 defined as:\n\u03c7\u03042 = \u22122 ln\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nL(M\u0304 , \u03a9m , \u03a9rc )dM\u0304\n\n(29)\n\nUsing equations (27), (28) and (29), we find:\n\u03c7\u03042 (\u03a9m , \u03a9rc ) = \u03c72 (M\u0304 = 0, \u03a9m , \u03a9rc ) \u2212\n\nB(\u03a9m , \u03a9rc )2\nC\n\n+ ln(C/2\u03c0)\n\n(30)\n\nwhere\nB(\u03a9m , \u03a9rc ) =\n\nobs (zi ) \u2212 \u03bcth (zi ; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc , M\u0304\n\u03c3i2\n\nX [\u03bc\ni\n\nC=\n\nX 1\ni\n\n\u03c3i2\n\n= 0)]\n\n,\n\n,\n\n(31)\n\n(32)\n\nEquivalent to marginalization is the minimization with respect to M\u0304 .

The value of Hubble parameter at\nthe minimum value of \u03c72 is h = 0.70. Obviously our results are different from what\nreported in [26] and [31]. In the first reference they report the following values for the\n+0.04\nmodel parameters: \u03a9m = 0.34+0.07\n\u22120.08 and \u03a9rc = 0.24\u22120.04 using old SNIa Gold sample\nwhile in the second reference Marteens et. al. reported: \u03a9m = 0.270 and \u03a9rc = 0.125.\nWe point out that the constraint by SNIa is very sensitive to the various catalogs of\nsupernova data set [62]. Table 2 indicates the results from observational constraints on\nthe free parameters. Figures 5 and 6 show the comparison of the theoretical prediction\nof distance modulus by using the best fit values of model parameters and observational\nvalues from new Gold sample and SNLS supernova, respectively. For the age consistency\ntest we substitute the parameters of model from the SNIa new Gold sample and SNLS\nfitting in equation (66) (see Sec. 5 for more details) and obtain the age of universe about\n+1.03\n13.78+0.68\n\u22120.59 Gry and 14.96\u22121.43 Gry, respectively. They give a universe older than what\nis expected from the old stars.\nThe other constrain results from the CMB acoustic peak observations. Before last\nscattering, the photons and baryons are tightly coupled by Compton scattering and\nbehave as a fluid. The oscillations of this fluid, occurring as a result of the balance\nbetween the gravitational interactions and the photon pressure, lead to the familiar\nspectrum of peaks and troughs in the averaged temperature anisotropy spectrum which\nwe measure today. The odd and even peaks correspond to maximum compression of\nthe fluid and to rarefaction, respectively [64]. In an idealized model of the fluid, there\nis an analytic relation for the location of the m-th peak: lm \u2248 mlA [65, 66] where lA\nis the acoustic scale which may be calculated analytically and depends on both preand post-recombination physics as well as the geometry of the universe. The acoustic\nscale corresponds to the Jeans length of photon-baryon structures at the last scattering\nsurface some \u223c 379 Kyr after the Big Bang [5]. The apparent angular size of acoustic\npeak can be obtained by dividing the comoving size of sound horizon at the decoupling\nepoch rs (zdec ) by the comoving distance of observer to the last scattering surface\nr(zdec ):\n\n\u03b8A =\n\nrs (zdec )\n\u03c0\n\u2261\n.\nlA\nr(zdec )\n\n(35)\n\nThe size of sound horizon at the numerator of equation (35) corresponds to the distance\nthat a perturbation of pressure can travel from the beginning of universe up to the last\n\n\fObservational Constraints with recent Data on the DGP Modified Gravity\n\n13\n\nscattering surface and is given by:\nrs (zdec ; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc )\n=\n\n1\nH0\n\n\u00d7F\n\np\n\n|\u03a9k |\n\n\u0012\np\n\n|\u03a9k |\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nvs (z \u2032 )dz \u2032\nH(z \u2032 )/H0\n\nzdec\n\n\u0013\n\n(36)\n\nwhere vs (z)\u22122 = 3 + 9/4 \u00d7 \u03c1b (z)/\u03c1rad (z) is the sound velocity in the unit of speed of\nlight from the big bang up to the last scattering surface [18, 65] and the redshift of the\nlast scattering surface, zdec , is given by [65]:\nzdec = 1048 1 + 0.00124(\u03c9b )\u22120.738\n\n\u0002\n\n1 + g1 (\u03c9m )g2 ,\n\n\u0003\u0002\n\ng1 = 0.0783(\u03c9b )\u22120.238 1 + 39.5(\u03c9b )0.763\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0002\n\ng2 = 0.560 1 + 21.1(\u03c9b )\n\n1.81 \u0003\u22121\n\n,\n\n\u0003\u22121\n\n,\n\n\u0003\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u03c9m \u2261 \u03a9m h2 , \u03c9b \u2261 \u03a9b h2 and \u03c1rad is the radiation density. \u03a9b is relative baryonic\ndensity to the critical density at the present time. Changing the parameters of the\nmodel can change the size of apparent acoustic peak and subsequently the position of\nlA \u2261 \u03c0/\u03b8A in the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations at the last scattering\nsurface. The simple relation lm \u2248 mlA however does not hold very well for the peaks\nalthough it is better for higher peaks [66, 67]. Driving effects from the decay of the\ngravitational potential as well as contributions from the Doppler shift of the oscillating\nfluid introduce a shift in the spectrum. A good parametrization for the location of the\npeaks and troughs is given by [66, 67]\nlm = lA (m \u2212 \u03c6m )\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u03c6m is phase shift determined predominantly by pre-recombination physics, and\nare independent of the geometry of the Universe. The location of acoustic peaks can\nbe determined in model by equation (38) with \u03c6m (\u03c9m , \u03c9b ). Doran et. al. [67], recently\nhave shown that the first and third phase shifts are approximately model independent.\nThe values of these shift parameters have been reported as: \u03c61 (\u03c9m , \u03c9b ) \u2243 0.27 and\n\u03c63 (\u03c9m , \u03c9b ) \u2243 0.341 [66, 67].

It is easily shown that shift parameter is as follows [68]:\nR=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03a9m\n\nDL (zdec , \u03a9m , \u03a9rc )\n(1 + zdec )\n\n(44)\n\nThe observational results of CMB experiments correspond to a shift parameter of\nR = 1.716 \u00b1 0.062 (given by WMAP, CBI, ACBAR) [5, 69]. One of the advantages of\nusing the parameter R is that it is independent of Hubble constant. In order to put\nconstraint on the model from CMB, we compare the observed shift parameter with\nthat of model using likelihood statistic as [68]:\n2\n\nL \u223c e\u2212\u03c7CMB /2\nwhere\n\u03c72CMB =\n\n[Robs \u2212 Rth ]2\n2\n\u03c3CMB\n\n(45)\n\n(46)\n\nwhere Rth and Robs are determined using equation (44) and given by observation,\nrespectively.

Here we imagined flat universe.\n\nKoyama and Maartens [44] have recently shown the evolution of density perturbations requires an analysis of the 5-dimensional gravitational field. In this model Poisson\nequation is modified and shows the suppression of growth due to gravity leakage. The\ncontinuity and modified Poisson equations for the density contrast \u03b4 = \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 in the\ncosmic fluid provide the evolution of density contrast in the linear approximation (i.e.\n\u03b4 \u226a 1)[44, 77, 78] as:\n\u0227\n1\n\u03b4\u0308 + 2 \u03b4\u0307 \u2212 vs 2 \u22072 + 4\u03c0G 1 +\n\u03c1 \u03b4 = 0,\na\n3\u03b1\n\n\u0010\n\nh\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b1 = 1 \u2212 2rc H\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0011 i\n\n1+\n\n\u1e22\n3H 2\n\n\u0013\n\n(57)\n\n(58)\n\nthe dot denotes the derivative with respect to time. Thus the growth rate receives an\nadditional modification from the time variation of Newtons constant through \u03b1.\nThe effect of dark energy in the evolution of the structures in this equation enters\nthrough its influence on the expansion rate. The validity of this linear Newtonian\napproach is restricted to perturbations on the sub-horizon scales but large enough\nwhere structure formation is still in the linear\nq regime [44, 77, 78]. For the perturbations\nlarger than the Jeans length, \u03bbJ = \u03c0 1/2 vs /\n\nG 1+\n\n1\n3\u03b1\n\nmatter (CDM) reduces to:\n\n\u0001\n\n\u03c1, equation (57) for cold dark\n\n\u0227\n1\n\u03b4\u0308 + 2 \u03b4\u0307 \u2212 4\u03c0G 1 +\n\u03c1\u03b4 = 0\na\n3\u03b1\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(59)\n\nThe equation for the evolution of density contrast can be rewritten in terms of the\nscale factor as:\n3H02\nd\u03b4 \u00e4\n2H\nd2 \u03b4\n\u2212\n+\n+\nda \u02272\n\u0227\nda2\n2\u02272 a3\n\nh\n\ni\n\n\u0010\n\n1+\n\n1\n\u03a9m \u03b4 = 0.\n3\u03b1\n\n\u0011\n\n(60)\n\n\fObservational Constraints with recent Data on the DGP Modified Gravity\n\n21\n\nNumerical solution of equation (60) in the FRW universe in the background of DGP\nmodel is shown in Figure 8. In the CDM model, the density contrast \u03b4 grows linearly\nwith the scale factor, while we have a deviation from the linearity as soon as universe\nenters to acceleration era. Increasing \u03a9rc leads a decreasing in the evolution of density\ncontrast which is in agreement to the finding about the behavior acceleration parameter\nversus \u03a9rc (see Figure 1).\nIn the linear perturbation theory, the peculiar velocity field v is determined by the\ndensity contrast [77, 79] as:\nf\nv(x) = H0\n4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u03b4(y)\n\nx\u2212y\n\n|x \u2212 y|3\n\nd3 y,\n\n(61)\n\nwhere the growth index f is defined by:\nd ln \u03b4\n,\nd ln a\n\nf=\n\n(62)\n\nand it is proportional to the ratio of the second term of equation (59) (friction) to the\nthird (Poisson) term.\nWe use the evolution of the density contrast \u03b4 to compute the growth index of\nstructure f , which is an important quantity for the interpretation of peculiar velocities\nof galaxies, as discussed in [79, 80] for the Newtonian and the relativistic regime of\nstructure formation. Replacing the density contrast with the growth index in equation\n(60) results in the evolution of growth index as:\n3H 2\ndf\n\u00e4\n1\n= 20 1 +\n\u03a9m \u2212 f 2 \u2212 f 1 +\nd ln a\n3\u03b1\n2\u0227 a\naH 2\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nh\n\ni\n\n(63)\n\nFigure 9 shows the numerical solution of equation (63) in terms of redshift. An analytic\nformula for the present growth index in the flat \u039bCDM model has been given in ref.\n0.6\n[45] as f (z = 0.0, \u03a9m ) \u2243 \u03a9m\n, here we extend this formula for the universe governed\nby DGP modified gravity. The simplest form for fitting formula in the wide range of\n\u03a9m and \u03a9rc is\n0.6\nf (z = 0.0; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc ) \u2243 \u03a9m\n+ (0.0159 + 0.0603\u03a9m ) \u00d7\n\n\u0012\n\nexp [1.0694 \u2212 0.3867 ln \u03a9m ]2 \u03a9rc\n\u22120.0542\u03a9m \u2212 0.0100\n\n\u0013\n\n(64)\n\nFigure 10 shows growth index, f (z = 0.0; \u03a9m = 0.30), as a function of \u03a9rc derived\nfrom numerical solution of equation (63) and illustrated by fitting formula (equation\n(64)).\nTo use observational results implied to linear structure formation we rely to the\nobservation of 220, 000 galaxies with the 2dFGRS experiment provides the numerical\nvalue of growth index [70]. By measurements of two-point correlation function, the\n2dFGRS team reported the redshift distortion parameter of \u03b5 = f /\u03ba = 0.49 \u00b1 0.09 at\nz = 0.15, where \u03ba is the bias parameter describing the difference in the distribution of\ngalaxies and their masses. Verde et al. (2003) used the bispectrum of 2dFGRS galaxies\n[81, 82] and obtained \u03baverde = 1.04 \u00b1 0.11 which gave f = 0.51 \u00b1 0.10. Now we fit the\ngrowth index at the present time derived from the equation (63) with the observational\nvalue. This fitting gives a less constraint to the parameters of the model, so in order\n\n\f22\n\nM. S. Movahed, M.Farhang and S.

The\nproblem is that the universe's age in the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) universe is less than\nthe age of old stars in it. Studies on the old stars [84] suggest an age of 13+4\n\u22122 Gyr for\nthe universe. Richer et. al. [85] and Hasen et. al. [86] also proposed an age of 12.7 \u00b1 0.7\nGyr, using the white dwarf cooling sequence method (for full review of the cosmic age\nsee [5]). The age of universe integrated from the big bang up to now is given by:\nt0 (\u03a9m , \u03a9rc ) =\n=\n\nZ\n\nt0\n\nZ0 \u221e\n0\n\ndt\ndz \u2032\n(1 + z \u2032 )H(z \u2032 )\n\n(66)\n\nFigure 11 shows the dependence of H0 t0 (Hubble parameter times the age of universe)\non \u03a9rc for a flat universe. Obviously increasing \u03a9rc results in a longer age for the\nuniverse. As shown in the lower panel of Figure 11, \u03a9rc behaves as the same as dark\nenergy, \u03a9\u039b , in the flat \u039bCDM model. Finally we do the consistency test, comparing\nthe age of universe derived from this model with the age of old stars and Old High\nRedshift Galaxies (OHRG) in various redshifts. Table 2 shows that the age of universe\nfrom the combined analysis of SNIa+CMB+gas+SDSS+LSS is 14.55+0.32\n\u22120.22 Gyr and\n+0.15\n13.88\u22120.15 for new Gold sample and SNLS data, respectively. These values are in\nagreement with the age of old stars [84]. Here we take three OHRG for comparison\nwith the DGP model, namely the LBDS 53W091, a 3.5-Gyr old radio galaxy at z = 1.55\n[87], the LBDS 53W069 a 4.0-Gyr old radio galaxy at z = 1.43 [88] and a quasar, APM\n08279 + 5255 at z = 3.91 with an age of t = 2.1+0.9\n\u22120.1 Gyr [89]. The latter has once\nagain led to the \"age crisis\". An interesting point about this quasar is that it cannot\nbe accommodated in the \u039bCDM model [90]. To quantify the age-consistency test we\nintroduce the expression \u03c4 as:\n\u03c4 =\n\nt(z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc )\nt(z; \u03a9m , \u03a9rc )H0\n,\n=\ntobs\ntobs H0\n\n(67)\n\nwhere t(z) is the age of universe, obtained from the equation (66) and tobs is an\nestimation for the age of old cosmological object. In order to have a compatible age for\nthe universe we should have \u03c4 > 1. Table 4 shows the value of \u03c4 for three mentioned\nOHRG. We see that the parameters of DGP model from the combined observations\ndon't provide a compatible age for the universe, compared to the age of old objects,\nwhile the SNLS data result in a longer age for the universe. Once again for the DGP\nmodel, APM 08279 + 5255 at z = 3.91 has a longer age than the universe but gives\nbetter results than most Quintessence and braneworld models [91, 92, 93, 94].\n\n6 Conclusion\nWe studied a self accelerating cosmological model, DGP modified gravity. The effect of\nthis model on the age of universe, the radial comoving distance, the comoving volume\nelement and the variation of the apparent size of objects with the redshift (AlcockPaczynski test) have been studied. The evolution of density contrast, \u03b4, as a function\nof scale factor for various values of \u03a9rc shows that increasing \u03a9rc suppresses the\n\n\f24\n\nM. S. Movahed, M.Farhang and S.

The observational constraint just by using SNIa+CMB indicated that\nour universe is spatially open but combining these result with SDSS+gas+LSS showed\nthat our universe in the DGP model is very good agreement with the spatially flat\nuniverse. In comparison between \u039bCDM and DGP in terms of \u03c72\u03bd , Table 5 shows that\nthese two models result almost same values.\nWe also performed the age test, comparing the age of old stars and old high redshift\ngalaxies with the age derived from this model. From the best fit parameters of the model\nusing new Gold sample and SNLS SNIa, we obtained an age of 14.55+0.32\n\u22120.22 Gyr and\n13.88+0.15\nGyr,\nrespectively,\nfor\nthe\nuniverse\nwhich\nis\nin\nagreement\nwith\nthe age of old\n\u22120.15\nstars. We also chose two high redshift radio galaxies at z = 1.55 and z = 1.43 with a\nquasar at z = 3.91. The ages of the two first objects were consistent with the age of\nuniverse, i.e.,they were younger than the universe while the third one was not.\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nA. G.
