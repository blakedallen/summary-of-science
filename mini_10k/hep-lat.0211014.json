For example, the main theoretical input in extracting the ratio |Vtd /Vts |\ninvolves a combination of the decay constants, fB and fBs , which parameterize leptonic B and\nBs decays, and of the neutral B and Bs mixing parameters, BB p\nand BBs . Uncertainties in these\nquantities, or more specifically in the combination \u03be \u2261 (fBs /fB ) BBs /BB , currently restrict our\nability to carry out stringent consistency checks of the Standard Model (e.g. see [1]). If these\ntheoretical errors could be reduced by a factor of 2 or more the impact would be immediate and\nfar-reaching. Similarly, high precision theoretical calculations of form factors governing B \u2192 Dl\u03bd\u0304\nand B \u2192 \u03c0l\u03bd\u0304 decays are crucial to determinations of |Vcb | and |Vub |, respectively.\nMonte Carlo simulation of QCD on a lattice will ultimately provide the most accurate theoretical\ndeterminations of mixing parameters, decay constants, and form factors since lattice QCD is one\nof the few systematically improvable approaches to QCD. Understanding and removing systematic\nuncertainties in lattice calculations, however, is arduous and complicated, and much of the effort\nin lattice gauge theory over the past decade has focused on this task. One very promising outcome\nof all this activity is the emergence of improved staggered actions for light quarks combined with\nhighly improved glue actions. The MILC collaboration, for instance, works with the \"AsqTad\"\nquark action which is free from the leading discretization errors, including those arising from\nthe\n\u0001\nbreaking of the fermion doubling symmetry, so that the action is accurate up to O \u03b1s a2 errors.\n\u0001\nThey employ the one-loop Symanzik improved glue action with errors coming in only at O \u03b12s a2 .\nStaggered actions have an exact chiral symmetry at zero mass and are much cheaper to simulate\nthan Wilson-type quark actions, so it has been possible for the MILC collaboration to carry out\nunquenched simulations with much smaller dynamical quark masses than has been attempted in\nthe past. They are now starting to obtain impressive results for light hadron spectroscopy and\nlight meson decay constants [2, 3].\nIn this article we demonstrate that improved staggered quarks can also be used very effectively\nto simulate the light quark in heavy-light systems such as in B-physics. The past decade has seen\nsignificant progress in our ability to simulate heavy quarks\naccurately (the commonly used NRQCD\n\u0001\n2\naction, for instance, has errors coming in at O \u03b1s a and O (\u03b1s \u039bQCD /M ), and work is underway to\nremove the latter). On the other hand, only Wilson-type actions have been used for the valence light\nquarks in heavy-light mesons, baryons, and electroweak currents, making it difficult to go much\nbelow mstrange /2 in the light quark mass due to the necessary computational expense. Consequently,\nthe extrapolation of simulation results to the chiral limit leads to the dominant systematic error\nin studies of B and D mesons (aside from quenching uncertainties). Furthermore the leading\ndiscretization errors in heavy-light simulations come from the light quark sector since Wilson-type\nactions have worse finite lattice spacing errors than improved glue, improved staggered, or NRQCD\nactions. This situation motivated us to initiate a new approach to heavy-light simulations, namely\nthe use of improved staggered light quarks combined with nonrelativistic heavy quarks. Our\napproach can trivially be modified to use a Wilson-like action for the heavy quark instead of\nNRQCD. The goal is to simulate B physics at much smaller light quark masses than has been\npossible in the past and significantly reduce chiral extrapolation errors in decay constants, form\nfactors and mixing parameters. Work toward this goal has already started on the MILC dynamical\nconfigurations [4]. It is important, however, to first establish that we understand how to combine\nstaggered light and NRQCD or Wilson heavy fermions to form heavy-light operators, that we are\nable to carry out sophisticated fits to simulation data and extract physics reliably, and that these\nmethods produce results in agreement with well-established results. It is for the last reason that\nthis article focuses on the Bs system on quenched lattices, where methods existing in the literature\n2\n\n\fprovide a solid basis for comparison. We present results for Bs meson kinetic masses, some level\nsplittings, and the decay constant fBs as evidence that our approach is working. For quick reference,\nwe summarize the results of our finest isotropic lattice in Table I. Note that several systematic\nuncertainties remain, notably the error from determining the spacing on quenched lattices and\ndiscretization errors from using coarse lattices with the present level of improvement. Therefore,\nthe results presented in this paper are useful for comparison to similar lattice calculations, but they\nare not appropriate for inclusion in phenomenological analyses. Having established this method\nas a promising approach, work is now underway on unquenched lattices to remove or reduce the\nsystematic uncertainties and obtain state-of-the-art lattice QCD results.\nIn the next section we introduce and describe the formalism for combining staggered light\nquarks with heavy quark fields to form bilinear operators that create heavy-light mesons or represent heavy-light currents. A significant simplification comes about from recognizing the equivalence\nof staggered and naive fermions and writing down bilinears in terms of the latter. This will be\nexplained thoroughly below. In Section III we give simulation details starting with a description\nof the glue, heavy quark, and light quark actions and then a discussion of our constrained fitting\nmethods based on Bayesian statistics. Section IV gives results for heavy-light spectroscopy, including kinetic masses and a calculation of the Bs meson decay constant fBs . Three appendices\ncontain details regarding the theory, notation, and fitting techniques, respectively.\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nIn this section we describe how to combine naive/staggered light quarks with heavy quarks to\nform heavy-light meson and electroweak current operators. We adhere to the recently introduced\npractice of calling the doubler degrees of freedom \"tastes\" rather than \"flavors\" [5] (see also [6]).\nWe will be guided by the following properties of naive/staggered actions.\n1. Up to overall normalization factors, there is no difference between using naive or staggered\nvalence quarks in meson creation or current operators. Since naive fermions are easier to\ninterpret and to handle theoretically, we will construct our heavy-light bilinears using naive\nfermion fields rather than staggered fields.\n2. Any correlator involving naive fermion propagators can be rewritten in terms of staggered\npropagators. Since staggered propagators are cheaper to calculate numerically, when it comes\nto actual simulations we will always work with expressions that have been converted to the\nstaggered fermion language and involve only staggered (and heavy) quark propagators.\n3. The taste content of naive/staggered actions can be determined either in the coordinate or\nthe momentum space basis. For heavy-light physics and for perturbation theory we find the\nmomentum space interpretation to be more useful.\nWe start by reviewing naive fermions and the identification of different tastes in momentum space.\nWe will then explore the taste content of B mesons that appear when naive fermions are combined\nwith heavy fermions. We assume that the heavy quark action has no doublers, as in NRQCD, or\nthat doublers have been given masses of order the cutoff via a Wilson term, as in the Fermilab\napproach [7]. Heavy-light systems are much simpler than light-light systems since the heavy quark\nsuppresses the taste-changing processes of the naive/staggered quark.\n\n3\n\n\fA.\n\nThe free naive quark action\n\nMost of our discussion in this section will be for free unimproved naive fermions. Taste iden-\u0001\ntification and relevant symmetries survive the inclusion of gauge interactions and of the O a2\nimprovement terms incorporated into the action that we actually use in our simulations (see next\nsection for a description of the full action). The free unimproved naive fermion action is given by,\n\nS0 = a\n\n4\n\nX\nx\n\n(\n\n\u03a8(x)\n\n\"\nX\n\u03bc\n\n#\n\n)\n\n1\n\u03b3\u03bc \u2207\u03bc + m \u03a8(x) ,\na\n\n(1)\n\nwith\n\u2207\u03bc \u03a8(x) =\n\n1\n2\n\n[\u03a8(x + a\u03bc ) \u2212 \u03a8(x \u2212 a\u03bc )].\n\n(2)\n\nWe work with hermitian Euclidean \u03b3-matrices obeying {\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd } = 2\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd . It is well-known that the\naction (1) describes a theory with 16 tastes of Dirac fermions and that it has a set of discrete\n\"doubling\" symmetries,\n\u03a8(x) \u2192 eix*\u03c0g Mg \u03a8(x)\n\n\u03a8(x) \u2192 eix*\u03c0g \u03a8(x)Mg\u2020 .\n\n(3)\n\ng is an element of G, the set of ordered lists of up to 4 indices,\nG = {g : g = (\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , . . .), \u03bc1 < \u03bc2 < . . .} ;\n\n(4)\n\ne.g. (2), (0, 3), and (0, 1, 2, 3) are elements of G, as is the empty set \u2205. The corners of the Brillouin\nzone are denoted by the 4-vector \u03c0g such that\n(\u03c0g )\u03bc =\n\n\u001a\u03c0\n\n\u03bc \u2208 g,\notherwise.\n\na\n\n0\n\n(5)\n\nThe Mg are transformation matrices\nY\n\nM\u03bc\n\n(6)\n\nM\u03bc = i\u03b35 \u03b3\u03bc .\n\n(7)\n\nMg =\n\n\u03bc\u2208g\n\nwith\n\nAn illustrative way to reduce the taste degeneracy of the naive action is to diagonalize the\naction in spin space. Let \u03a6(x) and \u03a6(x) be a new set of 4-component spinor fields related to the\noriginal \u03a8(x) and \u03a8(x) fields via the Kawamoto-Smit [8] transformation.\n\u03a8(x) = \u03a6(x) \u03a9(x)\u2020\n\n\u03a8(x) = \u03a9(x) \u03a6(x)\n\n(8)\n\nwith\n\u03a9(x) =\n\n3\nY\n\n(\u03b3\u03bc )x\u03bc /a .\n\n\u03bc=0\n\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fIn terms of these new fields the naive fermion action takes on a spin-diagonal form,\nS0 \u2192 S\u03a6 = a\n\n4\n\nX\nx\n\n(\n\n\u03a6(x)\n\n\"\nX\n\u03bc\n\n#\n\n)\n\n1\n\u03b7\u03bc (x) \u2207\u03bc + m \u03a6(x) ,\na\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\n\u03b7\u03bc (x) = (\u22121)(x0 +...+x\u03bc\u22121 )/a .\n\n(11)\n\nStaggered fermions reduce the taste-degeneracy from 16-fold to 4-fold. The spin-diagonal form\nof Eq. (10) tells us it should be possible to do so, since each spin component of \u03a6(x) is independent\nof the other components. One way to proceed is to define 1-component fields \u03c7(x) through\n\u03a6(x) \u2261 e(x)\u03c7(x) .\n\n(12)\n\nThe c-number spinor e(x) is usually chosen to be constant, and one ends up with the standard\nstaggered fermion action for the fields \u03c7(x). Reference [9] goes through a more rigorous and\ngeneral method for reducing the number of independent tastes from 16 to 4 which does not rely on\nfirst going through the Kawamoto-Smit transformation. They exploit the symmetry (3) to place\nconstraints among the 16 different tastes so that only 4 of them remain as independent degrees of\nfreedom. (See also [10] which uses the Hamiltonian formalism .)\nEquations (8) and (10) allow us to derive the simple but important relation between the naive\npropagator G\u03a8 (x; y) and the staggered propagator G\u03c7 (x; y).

It can also be used to\nrederive familiar staggered correlators (e.g. for pions or rhos) starting from simple naive fermion\nbilinears. We emphasize that (15) is an exact relation even in the presence of gauge interactions; reexpressed as a relation between the inverse of the naive and staggered actions, respectively, for fixed\ngauge fields, it is valid configuration by configuration, and hence also for the fully interacting naive\nand staggered propagators. The relation (15) also holds for improved versions of naive/staggered\nactions.\nBefore going on to discuss heavy-light bilinears, we end this subsection on basic naive fermion\nproperties by reviewing the momentum space identification of naive fermion tastes.

[9]).\nB.\n\nHeavy-light bilinears\n\nTo discuss heavy-light bilinears we introduce heavy quark fields \u03a8H , which can stand for either\nheavy Wilson or nonrelativistic fermions (for the latter case we will use the notation \u03a8H (x) \u2192 Q(x)\nin later sections with Q(x) a 4-component spinor with vanishing lower 2 components). The simplest\ninterpolating operator one could write down for creating a B meson with a heavy quark field \u03a8H (x)\nand a naive antiquark field \u03a8(x) is\nWB (x) = \u03a8H (x)\u03b35 \u03a8(x) .\n\n(25)\n\nLet us analyze WB (x) in 3-dimensional momentum space. To do so we introduce the 3D Fourier\ntransformed fields\n\u03c8\u0303(k, t) = a3\n\nX\n\ne\u2212ik*x \u03a8(x, t)\n\n,\n\n\u03c8\u0303(k, t) = a3\n\nX\nx\n\nx\n\n6\n\neik*x \u03a8(x, t)\n\n(26)\n\n\fand similarly for the heavy fields \u03a8H . It is useful to introduce a subset Gs \u2282 G that involves only\nspatial indices \u03bc \u2192 j = 1, 2, 3. The full set G can be built up out of gs and gt gs with gs \u2208 Gs and\ngt corresponding to \u03bc = 0 (and Mgt = i\u03b35 \u03b30 ). In analogy with (18) we have\nZ\n\nk,Ds\n\n\u2261\n\nZ\n\nk\u2208Ds\n\nd3 k\n(2\u03c0)3\n\nZ\n\n,\n\nk,Ds,\u2205\n\nwhere Ds denotes the full 3D Brillouin zone, \u2212 \u03c0a \u2264 kj <\n\u03c0\n. Then, as is shown in detail in Appendix A,\nkj < 2a\na3\n\nX\nx\n\nWB (x, t) =\n\nX Z\n\ngs \u2208Gs k,Ds,\u2205\n\nn\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2a\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2a\n\n\u2261\n\n\u03c0\na,\n\nZ\n\nk\u2208Ds,\u2205\n\nd3 k\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(27)\n\n\u03c0\nand Ds,\u2205 the central region, \u2212 2a\n\u2264\n\ndk0 ik0 t\ne\n2\u03c0\nh\n\nio\n\n\u03c8\u0303 H (k + \u03c0gs , t) \u03b35 Mg\u2020s q gs (k, k0 ) + (\u22121)t Mg\u2020t gs q gt gs (k, k0 )\n\n.\n\n(28)\n\nFor gs 6= \u2205, the field \u03c8\u0303 H (k + \u03c0gs , t) creates a heavy quark with large spatial momentum so that\nany state containing it will have a large energy. Consequently, the contributions to the heavy-light\nP\nbilinear x WB (x, t) from low-lying states come from the gs = \u2205 part of the sum in (28)\nZ\n\nk,Ds,\u2205\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2a\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2a\n\nio\nh\ndk0 ik0 t n\n\u03c8\u0303 H (k, t) \u03b35 q \u2205 (k, k0 ) + (\u22121)t Mg\u2020t q gt (k, k0 ) .\ne\n2\u03c0\n\n(29)\n\nIn contrast, light-light bilinears receive contributions from all 8 sections of the spatial Brillouin\nzone (this can be seen by replacing \u03c8\u0303 H by \u03c8\u0303 in (28) and then using (21)). The gs 6= 0 contributions\nto heavy-light bilinears are discussed in more detail in Appendix A, where we consider more general\nbilinears and show that they couple either to exactly degenerate states or to artificial high energy\nlattice states.\nLet us point out that in (29) there are contributions from both the pseudoscalar and the scalar\nstate, which has a coefficient alternating in sign. The oscillating parity partner appears in lightlight correlators as well. In Section III B we discuss how fits are able to separate these contributions\nfrom correlation functions.\nC.\n\nHeavy-light two-point correlators\n\nOnce heavy-light bilinears with naive light quarks have been introduced, it is straightforward to\nobtain bilinear-bilinear two-point correlators and write them in terms of staggered propagators.\nStarting from this subsection we will revert to the usual practice of working with dimensionless\nspinor fields. Hence one should assume all \u03a8, \u03a8H and \u03c7 fields have been multiplied by a factor of\na3/2 and that all propagators are now dimensionless.

In later sections\nof this article we will present results showing good dispersion relations for B and B \u2217 mesons for\nmomenta up to at least apj = \u03c0/3 to check this hypothesis.\nAlthough the discussion above implicitly assumes the use of local sources and sinks, generalizing\nto smeared sources and sinks is straightforward as long as one takes care that the smearing function\npreserves the doubling symmetry (3). This work employs local sources and sinks, with good\nresults for the ground state mesons, but smearing is an important direction for future studies,\nespecially those of excited states. Nonlocal sources have been used extensively in staggered fermion\nsimulations of light hadrons.\nIII.\nA.\n\nSIMULATION DETAILS\nActions and parameters\n\nThe gauge action\nused to generate the isotropic gauge configurations is the tadpole-improved\n\u0001\ntree-level O a2 -improved action [11, 12]\n(iso)\nSG\n\n= \u2212\u03b2\n\nX\n\nx,\u03bc>\u03bd\n\n(\n\n1 R\u03bc\u03bd (x)\n1 R\u03bd\u03bc (x)\n5 P\u03bc\u03bd (x)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\n2\n4\n2\n3 u\u03bc u\u03bd\n12 u\u03bc u\u03bd\n12 u4\u03bd u2\u03bc\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(34)\n\nP\u03bc\u03bd represents the plaquette and R\u03bc\u03bd the 2 \u00d7 1 rectangle in the (\u03bc, \u03bd) plane; both are normalized\nso that hP\u03bc\u03bd i = hR\u03bc\u03bd i = 1 in the \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e limit. As part of our tests we also study anisotropic\nlattices where the temporal lattice spacing at is a few times smaller than the spatial lattice spacing\nas ; in this case improvement in the temporal direction is secondary to spatial improvement. The\naction used for the anisotropic lattices is the same in the spatial directions, but the rectangles\nwith two units in the temporal direction are omitted and the space-time coefficients adjusted to\nbe consistent with Symanzik improvement [13, 14]:\n(aniso)\nSG\n\n= \u2212\u03b2\n\u2212\u03b2\n\nX\n\nx,s>s\u2032\n\nX\nx,s\n\n1\n\u03be0\n\n\u03be0\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001a\n\n1 Rss\u2032 (x)\n1 Rs\u2032 s (x)\n5 Pss\u2032 (x)\n\u2212\n\u2212\n3 u4s\n12 u6s\n12 u6s\n\n1 Rst (x)\n4 Pst (x)\n\u2212\n2\n2\n3 us ut\n12 u4s u2t\n\n8\n\n\u001b\n\n.\n\n\u001b\n\n(35)\n\n\fFor the values of the inverse coupling \u03b2 and the bare anisotropy \u03be0 used in this work, the tadpoleimprovement Landau-link factors us and ut , the spatial lattice spacing as , and the renormalized\nanisotropy \u03be \u2261 as /at were determined in Ref. [15]. The simulation parameters for the gauge\nconfigurations are summarized in Table II.\nThe parameters for the isotropic lattices were intended to give approximately the same spatial\nlattice spacings as the anisotropic lattices. The isotropic 83 \u00d720 lattice parameters were discussed in\nRef. [16]. The isotropic 123 \u00d732 configurations were generated for this work, and we determined the\nlattice spacing by calculating the static quark potential and using the phenomenological parameter\nr0 = 0.5 fm [17] to set the scale.\n\u0001\nThe light quark action we use is the O a2 tadpole-improved staggered action [18, 19] which\ncontains in place of the simple covariant difference operator in (1) an improved difference operator\nconstructed as follows. First, the link matrices U\u03bc (x) are replaced by \"fat-link\" matrices [20]:\nV\u03bc (x) \u2261\n\nY\n\n\u03c16=\u03bc\n\n(2)\n\n\u2207\u03c1\n1+\n4\n\n!\n\nU\u03bc (x)\n\n(36)\n\nsymmetrized\n\nwhich contain 3, 5, and 7-link paths, all bent to fit within an elemental hypercube (Ref. [18] lists\neach term explicitly, and we write the second-derivative operator \u2207(2) in Appendix B). This smearing effectively introduces a form factor in the quark-gluon vertex which suppresses the coupling\nof high momentum gluons to low momentum quarks. Second, the fat-link is further modified by\nadding\nwhat has come to be known as the Lepage term [19] in order to cancel the low momentum\n\u0001\n2\nO a error introduced by (36):\nV\u03bc\u2032 (x) \u2261 V\u03bc (x) \u2212\n\nX (\u2207\u03c1 )2\n\n\u03c16=\u03bc\n\n4\n\nU\u03bc (x) .\n\n(37)\n\n\u0001\n2\n\nFinally, the remaining O a (rotational) errors are subtracted\nby including a cube of the difference\n\u0001\n2\noperator, the so-called Naik term [21]; therefore the O a improved action is obtained by the\nreplacement\n1\n\u2207\u03bc \u2212\u2192 \u2207\u2032\u03bc \u2212 (\u2207\u03bc )3 .\n6\n\n(38)\n\nThis action has been used in many recent simulations, quenched and unquenched, most prominently\nby the MILC Collaboration who call it the \"AsqTad\" action. In order to apply tadpole improvement\n(2)\nconsistently, powers of the covariant difference operators, (\u2207\u03bc )n and (\u2207\u03bc )n , are obtained by n\n(2)\nsuccessive applications of \u2207\u03bc or \u2207\u03bc , respectively, with no tadpole factors, replacing U\u03bc \u2192 U\u03bc /u\u03bc\nin the final expression only after setting terms like U\u03bc (x)U\u03bc\u2020 (x) equal to 1. In other words, one writes\nevery operator in (36) in terms of paths of links, dividing each link variable by its corresponding\ntadpole factor u\u03bc .\nIn this work we utilize anisotropic lattices, for which the improved staggered action is rewritten\nbreaking the sum over spacetime directions into spatial and temporal parts\nat\n\nX \u03b7\u03bc \u0012\n\u03bc\n\na\u03bc\n\n1\n\u2207\u2032\u03bc \u2212 (\u2207\u03bc )3\n6\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u2212\u2192 \u03b7t \u2207\u2032t \u2212 yt,naik (\u2207t )3\n6\n\n\u0013\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nc0 X\n\u03b7k \u2207\u2032k \u2212 (\u2207k )3\n\u03be k\n6\n\n(39)\n\nThe parameter c0 is tuned to give the correct pion dispersion relation.

In most cases we set\nall 6 of the ci = 1 and refer to this as the 1/M 2 NRQCD action, even though the leading 1/M 3\nrelativistic correction is also included. In order to make corresponding perturbative calculations\nsimpler, some simulations were done setting c1 = c2 = c3 = c6 = 0 with c4 = c5 = 1, and we call\nthis the 1/M NRQCD action. In practice the results depend very little on which action is used,\nsince the nonrelativistic approximation is very good for B mesons.\nThe bare mass of the heavy quark, M0 , is chosen to be close to the bottom quark mass, based on\nsimulations with Wilson-like light quarks [23, 24]. The bare mass of the staggered quark m is tuned\nto be close to the strange quark mass using the condition that the q\nratio of the \"s\u0304s\" pseudoscalar\nmeson mass to the \"s\u0304s\" vector meson mass is approximately equal to 2m2K \u2212 m2\u03c0 /m\u03c6 = 0.673. On\nunquenched lattices the \u03c6 mass is probably not accurately determined since it should be sensitive\nto the sea quark masses decreasing through the threshold for \u03c6 \u2192 KK. Instead one should first\ndetermine the lattice spacing, then use 2m2K \u2212 m2\u03c0 to determine the bare strange quark mass. On\nthe other hand, for the quenched lattices in this work, the ratio serves as an appropriate fiducial\nfor comparison between different lattices.\n\n10\n\n\fB.\n\nFitting methods\n\nThe light quark propagators are computed with anti-periodic boundary conditions in the temporal direction; in contrast, the evolution of the heavy quark in time requires only an initial condition.\nDue to this difference, heavy-light meson correlators with temporal separations greater than Nt /2\nwill be contaminated from the light quark propagating backward in time from the source across\nthe time boundary, so we only compute heavy-light meson correlators up to Nt /2. The periodicity\nof the light quark can still be utilized to improve statistics by evolving the heavy quark backward\nin time from the source. We average the forward and backward propagating meson correlators\nconfiguration by configuration.\nThe process of fitting the meson correlators to a series of exponentials is complicated because\nthe temporal doubler causes the correlation function to couple not only to states with the quantum\nnumbers expected from the continuum limit, but also to states with opposite parity times an\noscillating factor (\u22121)t+1 . Thus, we expect the meson correlators to have the form\nKp \u22121\n\nf (t; {Ak , Ek }) =\n\nX\n\nKp +Ko \u22121\n\u2212Ek t\n\nAk e\n\nn=0\n\n+\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)t+1 Ak e\u2212Ek t\n\n(46)\n\nk=Kp\n\nwhich includes Kp states of expected parity and Ko states of opposite parity. In our study we always\ntake Ko = Kp or Kp \u2212 1, and for the excited state energies we use the differences \u2206Ek \u2261 Ek \u2212 Ek\u22122\nas parameters in the fit. The K = Kp + Ko terms in the fitting function (46) can be rearranged as\nf (t; {Ak , Ek }) = A0 e\u2212E0 t + (\u22121)t+1 A1 e\u2212E1 t\n+\n\nK\u22121\nX\n\n(\u22121)k(t+1) Ak e\u2212(\u2206Ek +\u2206Ek\u22122 +...) t .\n\n(47)\n\nk=2\n\nNote that terms with even k are simple exponentials and those with odd k are oscillating exponentials.\nRecently a curve fitting method has been introduced to our community which allows one to\nestimate the systematic uncertainty from the series of states (47) in the correlator [25, 26]. One\nfits the correlation function C(p, t) for all computed values of t, varying the number of terms K in\nthe fit. For a given K, the best fit is obtained by minimizing an augmented \u03c72 :\n\u03c72aug (C(t), {\u03bbi }, {(\u03bci , \u03b4i )})\n\n2\n\n\u2261 \u03c7 (C(t), {\u03bbi }) +\n\n2K\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n(\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbi )2\n.\n\u03b4\u03bb2 i\n\n(48)\n\nwhere we have generically denoted the parameters of (47) by\n\u03bb \u2261 (A0 , E0 , A1 , E1 , A2 , \u2206E2 , . . . , AK , \u2206EK )\n\n(49)\n\nthe i-th component of which is \u03bbi .\nIn Appendix C we give a pedagogical summary of [25] as it applies to our calculation, but a\nfew remarks here are in order. The second term on the right-hand side of (48) is the contribution\nof Gaussian priors for each fit parameter, and one sets the prior means \u03bc\u03bbi and half-widths \u03b4\u03bbi\nbased on reasonable prior estimates for those quantities. The procedure is best illustrated by an\nexample. Let us take a pseudoscalar heavy-light correlator, computed with the unimproved, or\n\"1-link\" staggered action, on the 83 \u00d7 20 lattice as an example (see Fig. 1). The set of prior means\n\u03bc and half-widths \u03b4 used in fitting this correlator is given in Table III. The ground state energy\nand amplitude prior means were estimated from effective mass plots and the prior widths set at\n11\n\n\f50% and 25%, respectively. Priors for the excited states biased the amplitude fit parameters to be\nall of the same order and the energy differences to be equal and about 300 MeV, roughly the size\nof the 2S \u2212 1S and 1P \u2212 1S splittings in B spectrum. Recall that the NRQCD action does not\ninclude the rest mass, so the energy Esim is equal to the physical meson mass minus an energy shift\n\u2206. Tables IV\u2013VI show the results of fits to the propagator in Fig. 1 as the number of exponentials\nchanges from 2 to 8. The uncertainties are estimated from the inverse of the matrix \u2207\u2207\u03c72aug of\nsecond derivatives ([\u2207\u2207\u03c72aug ]ij \u2261 \u2202 2 \u03c72aug /\u2202\u03bbi \u2202\u03bbj )\n\u03c3\u03bbi =\n\ns \u0014\n\u0010\n\n2\n\n\u2207\u2207\u03c72aug\n\n\u0011\u22121 \u0015\n\n.\n\n(50)\n\nii\n\nwhich assumes the shape of \u03c72aug near its minimum (\u03bbi = \u03bbmin\ni , \u2200i ) is quadratic in \u03bbi\n\u03c72aug \u2212 \u03c72aug |min \u2248\n\n\u2202 2 \u03c72aug\n1 X\n(\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbmin\n(\u03bbj \u2212 \u03bbmin\ni )\nj ).\n2 ij\n\u2202\u03bbi \u2202\u03bbj\n\n(51)\n\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the non-oscillating and oscillating ground state energies, as well as the first\nexcited state energy, vs. the number K of exponentials in the fit. The rest of the fit parameters are\ngiven in Tables IV and V. One can clearly see the stability of the ground state fit parameters A0 , E0\nand A1 , E1 as K is increased. The beginning of a plateau at K = 3 implies at least one excited\nstate is needed in the fit in order for the excited state effects to be removed from the ground states.\nTable VI similarly indicates that K \u2265 3 is necessary in order to have an \"acceptable\" \u03c72aug /DoF;\nas we discuss in Appendix C, \u03c72aug /DoF should only be used as a gross check of the fit. E.g.\n\u03c72aug /DoF >\n\u223c 2 implies the fit function is a highly improbable model of the data, but one should\nnot necessarily prefer a fit with \u03c72aug /DoF = 0.8 over one with \u03c72aug /DoF = 1.3.\nNote that the uncertainties estimated from the fit for the ground state parameters are much\nsmaller than the widths of the corresponding priors, while the errors from the fit are comparable\nto the prior widths for most of the excited state parameters. The first excited non-oscillating state,\nk = 2, is an exception, appearing to be well constrained by the data until another non-oscillating\nstate, k = 4, is included in the fit. This means that the K = 3 and K = 4 fit result for E2 does\na good job of absorbing the effects of the excited states, but that there is not enough constraint\nfrom the data (or the priors) to separate the first excited state from the second. Thus, we conclude\nthat K = 3 is sufficient to obtain reliable estimates of the ground state energies and amplitudes\nand that the data is not sufficiently precise to extract excited state energies and amplitudes.\nWe are able to utilize this constrained curve fitting method to fit all of our data except in one\ncase: the heavy-light correlators computed with the AsqTad action on the 83 \u00d7 20 lattice. We were\nnot able to find fits with \u03c72aug /DoF < 8; one example is shown in Fig. 3 where the fit is visibly\nmuch worse than for the 1-link action shown in Fig. 1. This turns out to be a consequence of using\nan action with next-to-next-to-nearest neighbor couplings in the t\u0302-direction on a lattice with coarse\ntemporal lattice spacing.\nThe free Naik fermion dispersion relation (see Fig. 4) has complex solutions which implies\nthere may be excited states with negative norms contaminating the correlators at short time\nseparations. If the temporal extent of the lattice were sufficiently long and sufficiently precise\ncorrelators were computed, these negative norm states which have energies proportional to 1/a\nwould have a negligible effect: one could include only points with t greater than some minimum\nvalue in the fit, or one could include a negative norm state in the fit. However, for the 83 \u00d7 20\nlattice where 1/a = 0.8 GeV we are unable to drop enough points and get a good fit while keeping\nenough to fit to states of both parities. Also, when we tried to include a negative norm exponential\nin the fit, large cancellations with the positive norm excited states resulted in unstable fit results.\n12\n\n\fWe checked this hypothesis on the 1/a = 0.8 GeV lattice by simulating with 4 different staggered\nquark actions: the 1-link and improved actions as well as an action where the Naik term was\nincluded but no fattening of the links was done (the Naik action) and an action with fat-links but no\nNaik term (the \"fat-link\" action). We were able to obtain reasonable fits to heavy-light correlators\nwith the 1-link and fat-link actions, but not with the Naik action nor the fully improved action; we\ntabulate typical values for \u03c72aug /DoF in Table VII. Furthermore we performed simulations on an\nanisotropic 83 \u00d7 48 lattice with a very fine temporal lattice spacing 1/at = 3.7 GeV using the 1-link\naction, the AsqTad-tn action (yt,naik = 0), and the full AsqTad action (yt,naik = 1). In all 3 cases\nwe found acceptable fits with similar values of \u03c72aug /DoF, again tabulated in Table VII. Fig. 5\nshows the pseudoscalar propagator on this lattice for the AsqTad action. We have no problem\nfitting\u0001 to heavy-light correlators on a finer isotropic 123 \u00d7 32 lattice where 1/a = 1.0 GeV with the\nO a2 improved action. Therefore, the origin of the problematic fits on the 1/a = 0.8 GeV lattice\nis due to a particular lattice artifact arising from the temporal Naik term; but with a larger lattice\nscale 1/a \u2265 1.0 GeV these artifacts become insignificant.\nLet us return to the subject of estimating the uncertainties of the fit parameters. The second\nderivative of \u03c72aug (50) gives a reliable estimate of the uncertainty assuming that the priors are\nreasonable and that the data are approximately Gaussian. Resampling methods, such as the\njackknife or the bootstrap, can be used to check whether the distributions are Gaussian, and they\nprovide a simple check on statistical correlations between different fit parameters. Both procedures\ntake many subsets of the data as estimates of the original set; performing a fit on each subset yields\na distribution for each fit parameter from which an error estimate can be made. We employ the\nbootstrap method of resampling which requires some modification in order to properly handle the\ncontributions of the priors: as we show in Appendix C one must randomly select new prior means\n\u03bcb\u03bbi for each bootstrap fit [25]. Table VIII shows the results of applying this bootstrap analysis to\nthe heavy-light pseudoscalar correlator computed with the 1-link staggered action on the 83 \u00d7 20\nlattice. These results can be compared to those in Tables IV and V. We find both methods\nproduce comparable error estimates. For ease of error propagation, we use bootstrap method to\nquote uncertainties in the results presented below.\nIV.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThis section contains several results produced using the methods proposed and described above.\nThe purpose of this study was to check the validity of this proposal, so the results presented below\nshould not be construed as state-of-the-art calculations to be used for phenomenology. The results\nhere show that NRQCD-staggered calculations produce results comparable to NRQCD-Wilson\ncalculations \u2013 central values agree and statistical and fitting uncertainties are comparable \u2013 but at\na fraction of the computational cost. A more complete calculation of the B spectrum and decay\nconstant on finer, unquenched configurations is underway which will exploit the advantages of\nimproved staggered fermions to produce, we believe, the most accurate theoretical computation of\nthose quantities to date.\nA.\n\nLight hadron masses and dispersion relations\n\nAs mentioned before we chose a value for the bare staggered mass m so that the ratio of the\nlight pseudoscalar\nmass to the light vector mass would be somewhat near the phenomenological\nq\n2\n2\nvalue 2mK \u2212 m\u03c0 /m\u03c6 = 0.673. We use the pseudo Goldstone boson correlator Tr|G\u03c7 (x; 0)|2 to\ncompute the pseudoscalar meson mass and the correlator (\u22121)xk /a Tr|G\u03c7 (x; 0)|2 to compute the\n13\n\n\fvector meson mass. These masses and their ratio are listed in Table IX for the different lattices\nand actions. Note that even on the a\u22121 = 0.8 GeV lattice the light hadron correlators from the\nAsqTad action do not suffer the contamination from the negative norm states which affected the\nheavy-light correlators, as discussed in Sec. III B.\nOne measure of discretization effects is the dispersion relation. Specifically, we can compute\nthe \"speed-of-light\" factor\nc2 (p) \u2261\n\nE 2 (p) \u2212 E 2 (0)\n|p|2\n\n(52)\n\nwhich should equal 1\u0001 in the absence of lattice artifacts. The Naik term (38) is responsible for\nsubtracting the O a2 uncertainties in c2 (p) and its success can be seen in the following results.\nTable X lists the values of c2 computed with several values of momentum (averaged over all equivalent orientations in momentum space). On the coarser lattice (\u03b2 = 1.719) one can see that using\nfat links does not improve c2 much compared to the 1-link action, but adding only the Naik term\nto the 1-link action results in a significant improvement. This is borne out on the finer lattice\n(\u03b2 = 2.131), where the AsqTad action has an improved c2 . Fig. 6 shows comparison of c2 (p)\nbetween these results and those for improved Wilson actions [16]. The AsqTad action has a better\npion dispersion relation than the clover action, but not quite as good as the D234 action.\nOn the anisotropic lattices we use this quantity to tune the bare parameter c0 in (39); it is\nadjusted so that the pion speed-of-light parameter c2 (p) \u2248 1. Table XI lists the values of c0 we\nused and the resulting computed values of c2 for several momenta.\nB.\n\nFinite momentum Bs and its mass\n\nThe energies, Esim (p), extracted from correlation functions include an unknown but momentum\nindependent shift due to the neglect of the heavy quark rest mass, i.e.\nEsim (p) = E(p) \u2212 \u2206\n\n(53)\n\nwhere E(p) is the physical energy. In perturbation theory, the shift \u2206 is the difference between\nthe renormalized pole mass and the constant part of the heavy quark self-energy:\n\u2206pert = Zm M0 \u2212 E0 .\n\n(54)\n\nGiven Esim (0) from a simulation, the physical mass of a hadron can be computed through\nMpert \u2261 Esim (0) + ZM M0 \u2212 E0\n\n(55)\n\nwhere we attach the label \"pert\" to denote that the perturbative shift \u2206pert was used. For the\nfiner isotropic lattice and the 1/M NRQCD action with aM0 = 5.0 we find\n\u0010\n\nZM M0 \u2212 E0 = M0 \u2212 0.890 \u03b1s + M0 O \u03b12s\n\n\u0011\n\n(56)\n\nThe results obtained on the finer isotropic lattice, using the AsqTad staggered action, give\nMpert (B\n) = 5.55 \u00b1 0.45 GeV and Mpert (Bs\u2217 ) = 5.58 \u00b1 0.45 GeV. The numerical size of the\n\u0001 s\n2\nO \u03b1s uncertainty is estimated by taking \u03b1s \u2248 0.3, a typical\nvalue for quenched lattices with\n\u0001\n2\nthese spacings, and assuming the coefficient of the O \u03b1s term is 1 (times M0 as indicated in\n(56)).\nThe physical mass can also be calculated nonperturbatively, using the dispersion relation\nE 2 (p) = M 2 + |p|2 .\n14\n\n(57)\n\n\fIn order to cancel the unknown shift in (53), we consider (E(p) \u2212 E(0))2 = (Esim (p) \u2212 Esim (0))2 ,\nwhich we square and solve for the mass\nMkin \u2261\n\n|p|2 \u2212 [Esim (p) \u2212 Esim (0)]2\n.\n2[Esim (p) \u2212 Esim (0)]\n\n(58)\n\nWhen the mass is computed using (58), we call it the kinetic mass, to distinguish it from the\nperturbative result Mpert . Setting |p| = 2\u03c0/12a = 0.52 GeV, the kinetic masses on the finer\nisotropic lattice (with the AsqTad light quark action) are Mkin (Bs ) = 5.56 \u00b1 0.33 GeV and\nMkin (Bs\u2217 ) = 5.68 \u00b1 0.33 GeV.\nFigs. 7 and 8 show the kinetic masses for the Bs and Bs\u2217 for several momenta. We find excellent agreement between the perturbative and nonperturbative calculations of the mass. Furthermore, the consistency of the kinetic masses over several momenta demonstrate that the combined\nNRQCD\u2013improved staggered formulation gives the correct dispersion relation for Bs and Bs\u2217 up to\n|p| = \u03c0/3a = 1.1 GeV. One should not put too much weight on any agreement or disagreement\nbetween the calculation and experiment, given that the calculation is quenched, the lattice spacing\nnot precisely determined, and the quark masses not precisely tuned.\nC.\n\nMass splittings in the Bs system\n\nSince the shift \u2206 between simulation energy and the physical energy (Eq. 53) is entirely due\nto the NRQCD action, it is universal for all bound states with the heavy quark. Therefore, we\ncan compute mass splittings much more precisely than suggested by the uncertainties in Mkin and\nMpert . The splittings we compute on various lattices which correspond to the Bs system are given\nin Table XIV; below are a few remarks concerning the different calculations.\nThe hyperfine splitting MBs\u2217 \u2212 MBs is the most straightforward to compute since it is the\ndifference between the Esim for the non-oscillating ground states of the vector and pseudoscalar\ncorrelators. The results are comparable to previous quenched lattice studies; Figure 9 shows our\nquenched results on the 2 isotropic lattices compared to results published in Refs. [27, 28, 29, 30].\nThis splitting was also computed using NRQCD in Ref. [31], but they have different systematic\nerrors caused by the quenched approximation, specifically they set the bare bottom quark mass by\ntuning the \u03a5 mass, instead of a heavy-light mass. Our error bars are larger than those for most\nother results for two reasons. The first is simply that this work is based on 200 configurations\ncompared to 300 [28], 278 and 212 [29], and 2000 [30] (Ref. [27] used 102 configurations). The\nsecond is that the Bayesian curve fitting method includes as part of the quoted uncertainty an\nestimation of the error due to excited state contamination, in contrast to the single exponential\nfits used in previous work.\nQuenched results have an inherent ambiguity depending on which physical quantities are used to\nset the lattice spacing and bare quark masses. Preliminary results on unquenched lattices indicate\nthat the inclusion of sea quarks yields a unique scale and bottom quark masses [32] and give a\nBs\u2217 \u2212 Bs splitting [4] consistent with the experimental measurement MBs\u2217 \u2212 MBs = 47.0 \u00b1 2.6 MeV\n[33].\n\u2217 and B have the same quantum numbers as the oscillating\nThe L = 1, or \"P-wave\", states Bs0\ns1\nstates in the pseudoscalar and vector correlators, respectively. The fact that Esim for these states\ncan be computed using the same correlator data as the L = 0 states should be another advantage\nover formulations with Wilson-like quarks. In practice, however, it appears that the coupling of\nthese states to the local-local correlator is rather small and consequently the fitting uncertainties\nfor these splittings are large. Smeared sources and sinks for both heavy and light quark propagators\nshould be explored as methods for amplifying the coupling to the P -wave states. In Table XIV we\nlist some combinations of splittings.\n15\n\n\fD.\n\nDecay constant\n\nThe heavy-light decay constants are defined through the matrix element of the electroweak axial\nvector current\nh0|A0 |Bs i = h0| q \u03b35 \u03b30 b |Bs i = fBs MBs .\n\n(59)\n\nThe fields in the current above are those defined in the Standard Model, so a matching must be\nperformed between them and the fields of our lattice action.

The other perturbative uncertainties, due to one-loop\ncorrections to the coefficients in the action and in the operator matching, are O (\u03b1s \u039bQCD /M ) which\nis estimated to be 2.4%, assuming \u039bQCD = 400 MeV (and using M0 = 5.0 GeV). The 27 MeV\n(0)\ndiscretization error is our estimate of the O (\u03b1s a\u039bQCD ) error in the current J0 (62); again we\nassume the leading correction term comes with a coefficient of order 1. This error may be reduced\n\u0001\n(0)\nto O \u03b1s (a\u039bQCD )2 by improving J0 \u00e0 la Symanzik, which requires calculation of \u03c11 and \u03c12 in\n(65) [35, 36]. Finally, note that we have included the O (\u03b1s /aM ) power-law correction; we would\nhave estimated this to be a 6% effect, but it was calculated to be 3% (compare 70 and 71). Given\nthose uncertainties, we find agreement with the recent quenched world average fBs = 200 \u00b1 20\nMeV [37].\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe believe the methods outlined within this paper provide the quickest route to accurate calculations of B meson masses and decay constants on realistic unquenched lattices. Improved\nstaggered fermions have several advantages over Wilson-like fermions and are far less expensive\n17\n\n\fto simulate than domain wall or overlap fermions. The equivalence between naive and staggered\nfermions greatly simplifies the construction of operators which couple to states of interest. The fact\nthat the NRQCD action does not have a doubling symmetry leads to taste-changing suppression\nin heavy-light mesons, avoiding the ambiguities of the light staggered hadrons.\nWe have presented results on several types of lattices, the most important being the finer of\nthe two isotropic lattices since it is most similar to the unquenched MILC lattices. The results\nfrom these simulations have no unpleasant surprises: they agree with results produced by previous\nquenched simulations. Therefore, we can trust this formulation when it is used in parts of parameter\nspace inaccessible to other formulations.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Kerryann Foley for computing the static quark potential on the 123 \u00d7 32\nlattice and to Quentin Mason for providing Feynman rules for the AsqTad action.

The general choice for a Bg meson\ninterpolating heavy-light operator takes on the form\nWBg (x) = \u03a8H (x)\u03b35 Mg ei\u03c0g *x \u03a8(x)\n\n(A1)\n\nThe 16 different operators lead to degenerate states, since they are related by the symmetry\ntransformation (3). It is sufficient to work with just one of the 16 choices to extract all the relevant\nphysics. In our simulations we usually use the simplest choice g = \u2205, i.e. Eq. (25). Any other choice\nwould have served equally well. For instance, consider the case g = \u03bcj with \u03bcj equal to one of the\nspatial directions and carry out a sum over spatial sites. Eq. (A1) then becomes\na3\n\nX\nx\n\nWBj (x) = a3\n\nX\n\n\u03a8H (x)\u03b35 Mj ei\u03c0j *x \u03a8(x) = a3\n\nX\n\n\u03a8H (x)i\u03b3j ei\u03c0j *x \u03a8(x).\n\n(A2)\n\nx\n\nx\n\nOne sees that the zero spatial momentum Bj meson operator is identical to an operator one would\nsuperficially (and incorrectly) associate with a B \u2217 meson of polarization \"j\" with momentum \u03c0/a\nin the j th direction. The correct interpretation of (A2) is that it represents a zero momentum\npseudoscalar heavy-light meson. This will become more evident when we look at the operator\nWBg (x) in momentum space. We have verified that the RHS of (A2) gives identical correlators,\nconfiguration-by-configuration, to (25) (the latter summed over space). (In fact, the symmetries of\n(3) provide excellent tests of one's simulation codes.) Therefore, it is sufficient to work with just\none type of B meson operator, e.g. with just (25).\nIn order to delve further into the Lorentz quantum number and taste content of the interpolating\noperators WBg (x) we will look at this operator in momentum space. In terms of the \"tilde\" fields\n18\n\n\f(26) one has (we take the case where g does not include a temporal component; the latter case can\nbe discussed in a completely analogous way)\na3\n\nX\nx\n\nWBg (x, t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c8\u0303H (k, t) \u03b35 Mg \u03c8\u0303(k + \u03c0g , t)\n\nk,Ds\n\n=\n\nX Z\n\ngs \u2208Gs k,Ds,\u2205\n\n\u03c8\u0303H (k + \u03c0gs , t) \u03b35 Mg \u03c8\u0303(k + \u03c0g + \u03c0gs , t)\n\n(A3)\n\nWe extract the taste content of this bilinear by writing\n\u03c8\u0303(k + \u03c0g + \u03c0gs , t) =\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/a\n\n\u2212\u03c0/a\n\nZ\n\ndk0 ik0 t\ne \u03c8(k + \u03c0g + \u03c0gs , k0 )\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0/2a\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2a\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2a\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2a\n\ni\ndk0 ik0 t h\ne\n\u03c8(k + \u03c0g + \u03c0gs , k0 ) + (\u22121)t \u03c8(k + \u03c0g + \u03c0gs , k0 + \u03c0gt )\n2\u03c0\ni\ndk0 ik0 t h \u2020 gs g\ne\nMgs g q (k, k0 ) + (\u22121)t Mg\u2020t gs g q gt gs g (k, k0 )\n2\u03c0\n\n(A4)\n\nso that\na\n\n3\n\nX\nx\n\nWBg (x, t) =\n\nX Z\n\ngs \u2208Gs k,Ds,\u2205\n\nn\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2a\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2a\n\ndk0 ik0 t\ne\n2\u03c0\nh\n\nio\n\n\u03c8\u0303 H (k + \u03c0gs , t) \u03b35 Mg Mg\u2020s g q gs g (k, k0 ) + (\u22121)t Mg\u2020t gs g q gt gs g (k, k0 )\n\n(A5)\n\nSince there is no doubling symmetry for the heavy quark action, the field \u03c8\u0303 H (k + \u03c0gs , t), for\n\u03c0gs 6= \u03c0\u2205 , represents a heavy quark with large spatial momentum. Consequently, even though\nthe operator in (A5) couples to zero momentum meson states, the states corresponding to g 6= \u2205\nare very energetic. This is precisely the important difference between studying heavy-light and\nlight-light mesons with light staggered quarks.\nWe will estimate the effect of the gs 6= \u2205 sectors below, however the lowest energy state, and\nconsequently the dominant contributions to a WBg (x, t) correlator, will come from the region gs = \u2205\nP\nin the sum gs .\na3\n\nX\nx\n\nWBg (x, t) \u2192\n\nZ\n\nk,Ds,\u2205\n\nn\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2a\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2a\n\ndk0 ik0 t\ne\n2\u03c0\n\nh\n\nio\n\n\u03c8\u0303 H (k, t) \u03b35 q g (k, k0 ) + (\u22121)t Mg\u2020t q gt g (k, k0 )\n\n(A6)\n\nThe non-oscillating contribution is the Bg meson of taste g. Its parity partner is a 0+ meson,\nusually called the J = 0 P \u2212state. It is remarkable that both S\u2212 and P \u2212states can be obtained\nfrom a single correlator. Note also that the combination \u03c8\u0303 H (k, t) \u03b35 q g (k, k0 ), with its obviously\npseudoscalar Lorentz structure holds for all tastes g, i.e. for trivial and nontrivial Mg in (A1).\nWe discuss next those terms omitted upon going from (A5) to (A6). Take for instance the\ncontribution from gs \u2192 gl \u2261 \u03bcl with \"l\" equal to one of the spatial directions. The non-oscillatory\nterm becomes\n\u03c8\u0303 H (k + \u03c0gl , t) \u03b35 Mgl q gl g (k, k0 ) = \u03c8\u0303 H (k + \u03c0gl , t) i\u03b3l q gl g (k, k0 ).\n\n(A7)\n\nOne sees that the Lorentz structure is that of a 1\u2212 particle. However, since the heavy quark has\nvery high momentum and no doublers, this intermediate state is highly virtual. Such states would\nappear in fits to correlation functions as extra structure at energies of order \u2206E \u2248 1/(M a2 ). These\n19\n\n\flattice artifacts can also affect low energy \u0001states through loops; their effects can be estimated\nperturbatively and are part of the O \u03b1s a2 errors inherent in the action. Such errors can be\nremoved, if need be, by perturbatively improving the action further, but there is little evidence\nthat they are important at practical values of the lattice spacing.\nAPPENDIX B: DISCRETE DERIVATIVES AND FIELD STRENGTHS\n\nHere we write explicitly the higher order tadpole-improved derivatives and improved field\nstrength tensor used in the fermion actions.\n1\n[U\u03bc (x)\u03a8(x + a\u03bc ) + U\u03bc\u2020 (x \u2212 a\u03bc )\u03a8(x \u2212 a\u03bc )]\nu\u03bc\n\u2212 2 \u03a8(x)\n1 1\n[U\u03bc (x)U\u03bc (x + a\u03bc )\u03a8(x + 2a\u03bc )\n\u2207(3)\n\u03bc \u03a8(x) =\n2 u2\u03bc\n\u2207(2)\n\u03bc \u03a8(x) =\n\n(B1)\n\n\u2212 U\u03bc\u2020 (x \u2212 a\u03bc )U\u03bc\u2020 (x \u2212 2a\u03bc )\u03a8(x \u2212 2a\u03bc )]\n1\n\u2212\n[U\u03bc (x)\u03a8(x + a\u03bc ) \u2212 U\u03bc\u2020 (x \u2212 a\u03bc ) \u03a8(x \u2212 a\u03bc )]\nu\u03bc\n1\n[U\u03bc (x)U\u03bc (x + a\u03bc )\u03a8(x + 2a\u03bc )\n\u2207(4)\n\u03bc \u03a8(x) =\nu2\u03bc\n+ U\u03bc\u2020 (x \u2212 a\u03bc )U\u03bc\u2020 (x \u2212 2a\u03bc )\u03a8(x \u2212 2a\u03bc )]\n1\n[U\u03bc (x)\u03a8(x + a\u03bc ) + U\u03bc\u2020 (x \u2212 a\u03bc ) \u03a8(x \u2212 a\u03bc )]\n\u22124\nu\u03bc\n+ 6 \u03a8(x)\n\n(B2)\n\n(B3)\n\nThe covariant derivatives acting on link matrices are defined as follows:\n1\n1 h\n\u2207\u03bc U\u03bd (x) = 2\nU\u03bc (x) U\u03bd (x + a\u03bc ) U\u03bc\u2020 (x + a\u03bd )\nu\u03bd\nu\u03bc u\u03bd\n\ni\n\n\u2212 U\u03bc\u2020 (x \u2212 a\u03bc ) U\u03bd (x \u2212 a\u03bc ) U\u03bc (x \u2212 a\u03bc + a\u03bd )\n\n1 (2)\n1 h\n\u2207\u03bc U\u03bd (x) = 2\nU\u03bc (x) U\u03bd (x + a\u03bc ) U\u03bc\u2020 (x + a\u03bd )\nu\u03bd\nu\u03bc u\u03bd\n\ni\n\n(B4)\n\n+ U\u03bc\u2020 (x \u2212 a\u03bc ) U\u03bd (x \u2212 a\u03bc ) U\u03bc (x \u2212 a\u03bc + a\u03bd )\n\n\u2212\n\n2\nU\u03bd (x)\nu\u03bd\n\n(B5)\n\nThe field strength operator F\u03bc\u03bd (x) is constructed from the so-called clover operator \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd (x)\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n\u03a9\u03bc\u03bd (x) \u2212 \u03a9\u2020\u03bc\u03bd (x) ,\n2i\nX\n1\n\u03a9\u03bc\u03bd (x) =\nU\u03b1 (x)U\u03b2 (x+a\u03b1 )U\u2212\u03b1 (x+a\u03b1 +a\u03b2 )U\u2212\u03b2 (x+a\u03b2 )\n2\n2\n4u\u03bc u\u03bd {(\u03b1,\u03b2)}\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd (x) =\n\n(B6)\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\nwhere the sum is over\n{(\u03b1, \u03b2)}\u03bc\u03bd = {(\u03bc, \u03bd), (\u03bd, \u2212\u03bc), (\u2212\u03bc, \u2212\u03bd), (\u2212\u03bd, \u03bc)} for \u03bc 6= \u03bd and U\u2212\u03bc (x+a\u03bc ) \u2261\n\u0001\nU\u03bc\u2020 (x).

The likelihood probability\nis given, up to a normalization constant, by\n\u03c72\nP(C(t)|f (t; \u03bb), I) \u221d exp \u2212\n2\n\n!\n\n(C1)\n\nwhere I represents any unstated assumptions.

The minimization algorithm diverges as\nit searches in directions of parameter space which are unconstrained by the data. In the past\nthe solution has been to limit the number of fit terms, then discard data by including C(t) for\nt \u2265 tmin > 0; the optimal value of tmin is selected by a combination of looking for \u03c72 /DoF = 1,\nmaximizing the confidence level (Q factor), and observing plateaux in effective masses. A major\nweakness of this procedure is that it provides no estimate of the error due to omitting the excited\nstates from the fit.\nThe constrained curve fitting method of [25], by using Bayesian ideas, allows one to incorporate\nthe uncertainties due to poorly constrained states by relaxing the assumption that there are only\na few states which saturate the correlation function. Bayesian fits maximize the probability that\nthe fit function describes the given data, written as P(f (t; \u03bb)|C(t), I); this probability is related\nto the likelihood (C1) by Bayes' theorem\nP(f (t; \u03bb)|C(t), I) = P(f (t; \u03bb)|I)\n\nP(C(t)|f (t; \u03bb), I)\nP(C(t)|I)\n\n(C4)\n\nand is called the posterior probability. The denominator in (C4) is treated as a normalization\nand plays no role in finding an optimal set of fit parameters. On the other hand, the prefactor,\nP(f (t; \u03bb)|I), which multiplies the likelihood is the prior probability; its inclusion is what permits\nfits to many parameters.\nThe prior probability contains whatever assumptions about the values of the fit parameters one\ncan safely make without looking at the data. In our case of fitting meson correlators, before any\n21\n\n\ffitting is done one has an idea of a range of possible values for the amplitudes Ak and energies\nEk . Given such a range, the least informative prior distribution is a Gaussian with mean \u03bc and\nhalf-width \u03b4, in which case the prior probability is given by\nP(f (t; \u03bb)|I) =\n\n2K\u22121\nY\ni=0\n\n\u03b4\u03bbi\n\n1\n\u221a\n\n(\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbi )2\nexp\n2\u03b4\u03bb2 i\n2\u03c0\n\n!\n\n(C5)\n\nWe sometimes refer to the set of {\u03bci , \u03b4i } as the \"priors.\" The quantity which is minimized in the\nfits is\n\u03c72aug (C(t), {\u03bbi }, {(\u03bci , \u03b4i )})\n\n2\n\n\u2261 \u03c7 (C(t), {\u03bbi }) +\n\n2K\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\n(\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbi )2\n\u03b4\u03bb2 i\n\n(C6)\n\n\u221d \u22122 ln P(f (t; \u03bb)|C(t), I) .\nExpression (C6) highlights how the prior distribution stabilizes the minimization algorithm. As\none increases the number of fit parameters the terms from the prior in (C6) give curvature to \u03c72aug\nwhich prevents the minimization algorithm from spending much time exploring the flat directions\nof \u03c72 in order to find a minimum. The trick now is to distinguish which parameters are constrained\nby the data and which ones are fixed by the priors.\nA remark on counting the net degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of the fit is in order. As usual each\nof the data points represents one DoF, but then each parameter of the fit which is constrained\nby the data uses up one of those degrees. However, in the Bayesian curve fitting method, there\nare several fit parameters which are unconstrained by the data and do not count against the net\nDoF. Usually there are a few parameters obviously constrained by the data and a few obviously\ndetermined solely by the prior, but there may be some parameters for which such a distinction is\nnot clear. Therefore, we simply take the DoF to be the number of data points; instead of striving\nfor a fit which produces \u03c72 /DoF \u2264 1, we look for \u03c72aug /DoF \u2248 1 together with the property that\nthe ratio stays constant as more fit terms are added.\nGiven a sample of N measurements, one bootstrap sample is obtained by selecting N measurements, allowing repetitions, from the original N measurements. In principle one would perform\na fit on every possible bootstrap sample generating a Gaussian distribution of bootstrapped fit\nparameters {\u03bbb }, the half-width of which gives the bootstrap uncertainties \u03c3\u03bbBi . However, there\nare a total of (2N \u2212 1)!/(N !(N \u2212 1)!) \u223c N N ways to make a bootstrap sample,1 so it is impossible\nto generate the entire bootstrap ensemble \u2013 it also unnecessary. The bootstrap distribution can\nbe reliably estimated by randomly generating NB bootstrap samples for large enough NB . We use\nNB \u2248 N = 200, and have check that changing NB by a factor of 2 makes no significant difference\nin \u03c3\u03bbBi .\nIn the unconstrained fitting method \u03c72 would be minimized for each bootstrap sample, resulting\nin a set of fit parameters which reproduce the likelihood probability distribution (C1). For the\nconstrained fits where we minimize \u03c72aug , however, it is not enough to resample the likelihood \u2013\none must resample the whole posterior distribution, i.e. the product of the likelihood and the prior\ndistribution. Therefore, for each bootstrap sample we randomly choose a new set of prior means\n1\n\nCounting the number of possible bootstraps is equivalent to counting the number of ways n indistinguishable balls\ncan be distributed into k distinguishable buckets: each bucket represents an original measurement and the number\nof balls in a bucket indicates the number of times the measurement appears in a given bootstrap sample (and\nn = k = N ). \u0013\nThe answer is called the integer composition of n into k parts and is equal to the binomial coefficient\n\u0012\nn+k\u22121\n.\nk\u22121\n\n22\n\n\f{\u03bcb\u03bbi }, b \u2208 [1, NB ] using the same distribution used in (C6)\nP(\u03bcb\u03bbi )\n\n=\n\n\u03b4\u03bbi\n\n1\n\u221a\n\n(\u03bcb\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbi )2\nexp \u2212\n2\u03b4\u03bb2 i\n2\u03c0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(C7)\n\nThe bootstrap fits then yield an ensemble of NB results for each fit parameter with a nearly\nGaussian shape\nP(\u03bbbi )\n\n(\u03bbb \u2212 h\u03bbi iB )2\n\u223c exp \u2212 i\n2(\u03c3\u03bbBi )2\n\n!\n\n(C8)\nP\n\nB\nb\nB\nwhere \u03bbbi is the fit result for \u03bbi on the b-th bootstrap sample, h\u03bbi iB \u2261 N\nb \u03bbi /NB , and \u03c3\u03bbi is the\nbootstrap uncertainty for \u03bbi . In practice one finds that the distribution of fit results\nq is Gaussian\nshaped in the center but has stretched tails which artificially inflate the quantity h\u03bbi i2B \u2212 h\u03bb2i iB\nmaking it a poor estimate of \u03c3\u03bbBi [38, 39]. Instead we estimate the width of the bootstrap distribution by discarding the highest 16% and lowest 16% of \u03bbbi and quoting the range of values for the\nremaining 68% as 2\u03c3\u03bbBi .
