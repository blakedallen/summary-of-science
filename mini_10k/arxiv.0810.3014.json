INTRODUCTION\n\nSupernova remnant Cassiopeia A is both nearby\n(3.4kpc) and very young (\u223c330yr, Fesen et al. 2006), giving it a bright, richly detailed ejecta structure which has\nled to intensive study at many wavelengths, from gamma\nrays to radio (Rudnick 2002; Albert et al. 2007). Spectroscopy of distant light echoes from the original blast\nindicates that Cas A was the type IIb core-collapse of a\n\u223c15 M main sequence star (Krause et al. 2008), which\nmodels indicate are highly stratified, having lost a significant portion of the original outer layers of hydrogen and\nhelium prior to collapse in stellar winds (Woosley et al.\n1987). An initial outgoing \"forward\" shock wave driven\nby the blast is seen as a thin X-ray edge (Gotthelf et al.\n2001) expanding at \u223c5000 km/s, with a reverse shock\nbeing driven back into the outgoing ejecta as it interacts\nwith circumstellar material and the interstellar medium,\nexpanding at roughly half the rate of the forward shock\n(DeLaney & Rudnick 2003).\nThe high resolution available (100 =0.016pc) makes Cas\nA ideal for tracking the physical conditions in the layered ejecta material, following nucleosynthesis both before and during the supernova explosion, the subsequent\nmixing and inhomogenous transport of the ejected materials, and the formation of dust in situ.

Previous MIR studies of the\nremnant using Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) mapping placed constraints on the dust formation and the\nappearance of macroscopic mixing of materials (Lagage\net al. 1996; Douvion et al. 1999), and explored the velocity shifted line and dust emission in various regions using\nhigh-resolution MIR spectroscopy(Arendt et al. 1999).\nWe report on the first large, sensitive infrared spectral maps of the remnant, obtained by the Spitzer Space\nTelescope (Werner et al. 2004). The distribution of interstellar material, ejecta, and shocked circumstellar material is shown in the 24 \u03bcm maps of Hines et al. (2004).\nA model of the composition and mass of emitting dust\nassociated with the remnant using this MIR data set was\nundertaken by Rho et al. (2008). Ennis et al. (2006) highlighted the associated deep 3.6\u20138 \u03bcm Spitzer IRAC imaging, exploring the survival of the various nuclear burning\nlayers. Here we present the distribution of the global fine\nstructure infrared emission lines and constrain conditions\nin the emitting environments over the full remnant. The\ncomplex Doppler velocity field as traced by these fine\nstructure lines will be detailed separately (DeLaney et al.\n2008).\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTION\n\nLow-resolution 5\u201338 \u03bcm spectral maps were obtained\nin January, 2005 with the Infrared Spectograph (IRS,\nHouck et al. 2004) aboard Spitzer. A single mapping\nobservation consisting of 364 individual rastered spectra\nwas obtained in the Long-Low module (LL, 15\u201338 \u03bcm),\nutilizing 5.0800 steps across the slit (1/2 slit width), and\n15800 steps along the slit (approximately the full sub-slit\n\n\f2\n\nSmith et al.\n\nlength), for a total of 12.6 seconds per position. ShortLow (SL, 5\u201315 \u03bcm) coverage was obtained by tiling four\nseparate spectral maps to accomodate the maximum observation duration limits of the IRS, comprising 1218\ntotal independent spectra. Precise scheduling was required to fully tile the remnant without allowing gaps to\nopen between the quadrants. The SL slit was stepped\nat 200 \u00d75200 , for slightly less than double coverage and an\neffective exposure time of 11.4s per position. The best\neffective resolution is \u223c200 in SL and \u223c800 in LL (varying\nlinearly with wavelength). The total angular coverages\nobtained were 11.0 0\u00d77.0 8 (LL) and 6.0 3\u00d75.0 9 (SL).\nBackground removal was performed in situ, using spectral pointings selected from the periphery of the maps,\nchoosing regions with low relative 24 \u03bcm surface brightness. Since the IRS sub-slits (mapped to separate grating\norders) are separated by 18000 (LL) and 6800 (SL), multiple positions outside the main remant are obtained in the\ncourse of a full spectral map in both orders, which aids\nin selecting suitable background spectra. However, since\nCas A lies close to the Galactic plane, foreground and\nbackground emission from intervening and background\nGalactic cirrus clouds - including molecular hydrogen,\nPAH emission, and weak low ionization emission lines -\nis present throughout the region. This complex filamentary emission, readily seen in extended 24 \u03bcm maps (Kim\net al. 2008), varies considerably over the face of the remnant, and is also present in the selected background regions. Although the contaminating line emission is very\nfaint - .2% of the line surface brightness of the bright\nemitting ring - it provides a modest limitation on our\nability to recover fluxes for the lowest surface brightness\nlines (see also Fig. 1).\nAll IRS data were reduced from pipeline version S17\ndata products with Cubism, a custom tool created for\nthe assembly and analysis of spatially-resolved spectral\ncubes from IRS spectral maps (Smith et al. 2007). A\ntotal of four separate spectral cubes were created, one\neach for orders 1 and 2 of both SL and LL. The flux calibration was achieved using appropriate extended-source\nFLUXCON corrections, and aberrant or \"rogue\" pixels\nwere automatically cleaned using the statistical methods\nbuilt into Cubism, with a small amount of additional\nmanual removal. The short 6.3s exposure ramps contain\nonly four samples, which leads to occasional anamolous\ncosmic ray correction, inducing small bad pixel clusters.\nThese were mitigated with statistical record-level bad\npixel flagging.\n3. SPECTRAL MAPS\nA full 7.5\u201314.7 \u03bcm map created from SL order 1 is\nshown in Fig. 1, and offers excellent correspondence with\nthe 8 \u03bcm IRAC map of Ennis et al. (2006). Two representative full spectra extracted from the interior and along\nthe bright northern rim are also shown. These two spectra highlight the large dynamic range of line intensity,\nline ratios, and continuum shape across the remnant face.\nThe broad peaks at 9 and 21 \u03bcm arise from warm protosilicate and other dust emission (see Rho et al. 2008).\nSurface brightness maps from the eleven brightest\nemission lines (readily seen in Fig. 1) are shown in\nFig. 2. Spectral line maps were created by integrating the spectral cube intensities over a wavelength region large enough to sample the line flux at all veloci-\n\nTABLE 1\nDetected Emission Lines\nLine\n(1)\n\nWavelength\n\u03bcm\n(2)\n\n[Ni ii]\n[Ar ii]\n[Ar iii]\n[S iv]\n[Ne ii]\n[Ne v]\n[Ne iii]\n[Fe ii]\n[S iii]\n[O iv]a\n[Fe ii]a\n[S iii]\n[Si ii]\n\n6.636\n6.985\n8.991\n10.511\n12.814\n14.322\n15.555\n17.936\n18.713\n25.890\n25.988\n33.481\n34.815\n\nPeak Intensity\n10\u22127 W/m2 /sr\n(3)\n2.4 \u00b1 0.85\n221. \u00b1 0.86\n41.7 \u00b1 0.82\n21.0 \u00b1 0.43\n33.7 \u00b1 0.21\n1.75 \u00b1 0.17\n8.62 \u00b1 0.17\n2.49 \u00b1 0.14\n13.2 \u00b1 0.23\n27.1 \u00b1 0.29\n***\n4.08 \u00b1 0.18\n12.3 \u00b1 0.21\n\nTotal Flux\n10\u221213 W/m2\n(4)\n***\n7.72\n1.24\n1.17\n1.41\n***\n0.49\n***\n1.44\n4.95\n***\n1.02\n3.16\n\nNote. - Col.

Prior to integration, the local dust and synchrotron continuum emission\nwas removed by subtracting a weighted average of flanking wavelength regions, carefully chosen to avoid contamination by nearby lines at all velocities. The averaging weight used at each wavelength within the line region (\u03bbline ) for a given continuum wavelength (\u03bbcont ) was\n|\u03bbcont \u2212 \u03bbline |\u22121 .\nThe broad dust feature present throughout most of\nthe ejecta has a sharp peak at 21 \u03bcm, which induces\na steep and variable continuum in the 15\u201321 \u03bcm range\n(see Fig. 1). Estimating accurate line map fluxes in\nthis range (LL order 2) required a preliminary continuum removal step. The cube was first smoothed spatially by three pixels. A linear or quadratic background\nfunction at each (smoothed) spatial position was fitted\nusing two to four wavelength intervals free of line contamination, separately chosen for each line in the range.\nThis noiseless background estimate was removed from\nthe unsmoothed cube, and flanking continuum regions\nwere then subtracted as above to eliminate any residual continuum contributions underlying the line. For the\nfaint [Fe ii] 17.94 \u03bcm line in this region, uncertainty in\nthe continuum subtraction dominates the residual systematic errors.\nTable 1 lists the lines detected at low resolution, with\nthe peak surface brightness along the bright ring, as well\nas integrated line flux over the entire remnant.

The [O iv] line at 25.89 \u03bcm\nis a special example of such a case, as it is profoundly\nblended with [Fe ii] 25.99 \u03bcm even at high spectral resolution. The line map at 26 \u03bcm therefore contains contributions from both of these lines. Constraints on the\nfractional contribution of [Fe ii] and [O iv] in different\nregions can be made using expected line ratios to other\nlines of Fe, inluding [Fe ii] 17.94 \u03bcm, as well as [Fe iii]\n22.93 \u03bcm, detected in our follow-on high-resolution maps\nof selected regions. Such an analysis will be considered\nin a subsequent study, but is consistent with both [Fe ii]\nand [O iv] contributing and in differing amounts across\nthe remnant.\nIn cases where Doppler confusion could support more\nthan one line identification (most significant at the remnant center), we used our high-resolution spectra to resolve the ambiguity. An example for [Si ii] is given in\nFig. 3. A consistent set of three velocity components is\nvisible for [S iii], [Si ii], and a faint [Fe ii] line undetected\nin our low-resolution data set.\nA bright ring of emission, with overlapping smaller subrings most clearly seen in the N and SW, is the dominant\nstructure evident in all line maps, but significant variations in the line strengths occur throughout, in particular\nwhen comparing the interior to the ring. For the most\npart, the line strength variations on the bright ring are\nnot complicated by the three-dimensional structure of\nCas A. This is apparent in the Doppler reconstruction of\nLawrence et al. (1995) which shows that there are very\nfew overlapping structures along the same line of sight,\nwith the exception of the NNE and the base of the NE\njet. The same cannot be said of the interior emission,\nwhere nearly every line of sight has two or more domi-\n\nnant Doppler components (DeLaney et al. 2008).\n4. PROGRESSION OF THE SHOCK\n\nA reverse shock driven by the interaction of high velocity ejecta with the circumstellar material is propagating backwards into the outflowing material at a speed\nof 2500\u20134400 km/s (relative to the bulk outflow velocity,\nDeLaney & Rudnick 2003; Morse et al. 2004). Material\ninside the reverse shock boundary was \"once-shocked\"\nby the initial outgoing blast wave, but has subsequently\ncooled and recombined, and has not yet been re-heated\nand re-ionized by the returning reverse shock. Three\ndimensional Doppler reconstructions of optical and infrared lines such as [Ar ii] show that they illuminate the\nreverse shock in a broad band approximately in the plane\nof the sky, forming the bright ring (Lawrence et al. 1995;\nDeLaney et al. 2008). There is little or no emission from\nthese ring lines across the face of the remnant; however, interior to the ring, strong emission lines of the\nlow ionization species of S and Si appear. The velocity distribution of the interior [Si ii] emission, shown in\nFig. 4, demonstrates that this central material lies fully\ninside the reverse shock boundary. In addition to these\nlines, strong 26 \u03bcm emission is present in the interior,\ncontributed by [Fe ii] and/or [O iv].\n4.1. Electron Density\nWe can probe the change in density of the ejecta as\nthey encounter the reverse shock using the [S iii] lines. A\ntemperature-insensitive density diagnostic is available in\nthe 18.71 \u03bcm/33.48 \u03bcm ground-state fine structure doublet line ratio, arising from low-lying collisionally excited\nlevels. Recovering electron density requires balancing\nthe rates of collisional excitation and de-excitation and\nradiative transitions into and out of the relevant levels\nof the ion.

Up to date temperature-dependent collisional rates were taken from the IRON project (Hummer\net al. 1993) using its TIPBASE database interface. Radiative rates were obtained either from the IRON project,\nor, where available and reliable, from the NIST Atomic\nSpectra Database8 . The five coupled linear rate equations were solved numerically for all level populations,\nimposing the constraint that the population fractions\nsum to unity. This solution is performed for a given\ntemperature and density, interpolating the temperaturedependent collisional rates over log(T ). The resulting\nline ratio dependence on density is illustrated in Fig. 5.\nThe [S iii] 18 \u03bcm/[S iii] 33 \u03bcm line ratio saturates in the\nhigh density limit at 11.9, when collisions are rapid\nenough to populate the levels in equilibrium according\nto their statistical weights, and at a low density limit of\n0.56, when radiative effects dominate.\nTo recover electron density in the remnant, the two\n[S iii] line maps were spatially registered and convolved\nto matching resolution using a custom convolution kernel\nconstructed from Spitzer STinyTim PSF models in the\nmanner of Gordon et al. (2008). The matched images\nwere then ratioed, and corrected for AV =5 magnitudes\nof extinction using the interstellar extinction curve of\nChiar & Tielens (2006) (which results in a modest 10%\nincrease). All data in the ratio map with signal-to-noise\nbelow 2.25 were discarded, and map regions within 1\u03c3\nof the low or high-density ratio limits were set to the\nlimiting densities.\nThe [S iii] 18 \u03bcm/[S iii] 33 \u03bcm ratio ranges from 0.5 near\nthe center to a maximum of 7.5 on the bright rim. The\nresulting projected density map is shown in Fig. 6. This\ndensity is averaged over spatial scales of 1000 (0.16pc).\n8\n\nhttp://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/\n\n\f6\n\nSmith et al.\n\nAlthough the bright ring is not generally confused by\noverlapping Doppler components at this spatial resolution (Lawrence et al. 1995), high-resolution optical and\nX-ray images resolve structure out at 0.2\u2013100 (Fesen et al.\n2001; Hughes et al. 2000), so even without projection effects, some blending of structure is unavoidable. In regions where two or more strong emission components are\npresent along the line of sight, which includes most of the\ninterior emission, the [S iii] line ratio represents the average emission-weighted electron density. However, individual line ratios calculated for red- and blue-shifted\n[S iii] line sets in the interior emission near the remnant\ncenter yielded consistent values of \u223c0.5.\nThe interior [S iii] emission is uniformly in or near\nthe low limiting density of the [S iii] diagnostic (ne .\n100 cm\u22123 ), whereas the electron density in gas compressed by the reverse shock is much higher, peaking\nabove 1.5\u00d7104 cm\u22123 . This general result holds even assuming much lower temperatures, down to 1000 K. Unshocked interior emission at much lower densities has\nalso been observed in the type Ia supernova remnant\nSN1006 (e.g. Hamilton & Fesen 1988), and were originally identified in Cas A through free-free absorption of\nlow frequency radio emission by Kassim et al. (1995).\nHurford & Fesen (1996) obtain densities ranging from\n5000\u201315000 cm\u22123 for a range of optical knot compositions, consistent with Chevalier & Kirshner (1979), and\nin good agreement with our results on the bright rim.\nSince the density enhancement in strong non-radiative\nshocks is limited to a factor of four, the strong density enhancement provides evidence for rapid radiative cooling\nof the infrared emitting clumps after they pass through\nthe shock. Alternatively, hidden dense clumps may be\nentrained in the outflowing material, which are illuminated only as they pass through the shock. This could\nthen represent an extension to higher densities of the\nclumpiness apparent in the more diffuse X-ray-emitting\nejecta (Morse et al. 2004).\n4.2. Ionization State\nThe progression of the reverse shock into the ejecta\ncan be observed not only in the electron density, which\nincreases by at least two orders of magnitude, but also\nin the ionization state of the outflowing atomic material\nas it encounters the reverse shock.\nFigure 7 illustrates this progression by comparing line\nmaps from two infrared lines arising from ions of differing ionization potential - [Si ii] (8.2eV), and [S iv]\n(34.8eV) - together with a summed pair of high-energy\nX-ray helium-like and hydrogen-like K-alpha resonance\nlines: Si xiii (0.5keV), and Si xiv (2.4keV) (Hwang et al.\n2000). There is clear layering of ionization state, from\nlow energy species in the interior, higher energies on the\nbright ring where optical emission is also seen, and very\nhigh energies traced by X-ray line emission extending beyond the infrared-bright rim itself. Though line of sight\nprojection of multiple structures complicates the view in\nthe northern rim, it is evident that the observed layering\nis highly non-uniform as a function of azimuth as well as\nalong the line of sight.\nIn various positions, more or less of the O-burning\nlayer has encountered the reverse shock. In the direction along our line of sight, very little of this material\n\nhas reached the shock. These regions are dominated by\nlow ionization lines, [Si ii] in particular (see Fig. 7), which\nlie at lower velocities than the shocked ring of emission\n(Fig. 4). In these directions, neither element is seen in\nhigher ionization states in the infrared or X-ray. This\nlow-ionization pattern also appears at different azimuths\nalong the bright ring, indicative of positions where Oburning ejecta moving approximately in the plane of the\nsky have yet to encountered the reverse shock. This emission is consistent with material inside the reverse shock\nwhich has been ionized by ambient Galactic stellar radiation and/or illumination from the rim of shocked ejecta.\nIn other directions, moderate ionization state material traced by [S iv] is present, with weak or absent Xray emission. Finally, there are regions where only the\nhigh ionization Si X-ray lines are seen, predominantly\nat large radii. These variations likely represent different\nstages in the post-shock histories of the inhomogeneous\nejecta. The low density X-ray filaments and diffuse material are gradually heated and ionized as they penetrate\nthe reverse shock, with a time history that depends on\nthe shape of the ejecta density profile (Laming & Hwang\n2003). Higher density clumps of material can suffer a different fate, reaching temperatures of only \u223c104 K as they\nundergo rapid radiative cooling immediately post-shock,\nand are seen in [S iv].\nThe detailed histories of shock-heated material requires\nconsiderably more modeling, which incorporates variations in ejecta density and its profile, ejecta velocities,\nand irregularities in the location of the reverse shock.\nIt is not clear to what degree the density and ionization state of the material we now see passing through\nthe shock front is determined by initial conditions of the\nejecta - diffuse vs. clumpy, lower vs. higher velocity\n- and to what degree the heating, photo- and collisonal\nionization, and subsequent cooling by line radiation redistributes material between these phases. What is clear,\nhowever, is that the ejecta undergo a striking and rapid\nchange in density and ionization level as they encounter\nthe reverse shock.\n5. APPARENT INHOMOGENOUS MIXING AND\n\nTHE NEON CRESCENTS\nThe Cas A ejecta are by no means homogenous in\ncomposition or uniform in their layering. Using optical\nspectroscopy, Chevalier & Kirshner (1979) demonstrated\nabundance inhomogeneities in the oxygen burning products S, Ar, and Ca among the outlying fast moving\nknots, and suggested differing completeness levels of oxygen burning could explain these variations. Macroscopic\nmixing of similar nucleosynthetic products was suggested\nby Douvion et al. (1999) using ISO MIR line maps of Ar,\nNe, and S covering a portion of the bright rim. Hughes\net al. (2000) used Chandra X-ray spectroscopy to identify\nspatial inversion of iron and oxygen burning products. It\nwould be fair to say that non-uniformity of composition\nis the rule rather than the exception in Cas A.\nIn a stratified model in which different layers of ejecta\nmaterial are coming into contact with the reverse shock\nfront in different directions, the appearance of individual emission lines depends on 1) the expansion velocity\nof material, 2) the position of the reverse shock with respect to it, and 3) the subsequent ionization state of the\nmaterial as it passes through the shock. In this context,\n\n\fCassiopeia A\n150\n\n100\n\n\u2206\u03b4 (arcsec)\n\n50\n\n0\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\n-150\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\u2206\u03b1 (arcsec)\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\n-150\n\nFig. 7.- A color coded map in [Si ii] 34.8 \u03bcm (red, ionization energy 8.2eV), [S iv] 10.5 \u03bcm (green, ionization energy 34.8eV), and\nthe summed X-ray emission of Si xiii+Si xiv (hydrogen and heliumlike silicon, blue, ionization energy 0.5\u20132.4keV). Square-root scaling is used for all three channels, and the coordinate scale follows\nFig. 2, with a 32000 image size. Immediately evident is the insideout layering of ionization state, with low energy species in the unshocked interior region, and higher energy species layered within\nthe non-uniform shock region itself.\n150\n\n100\n\n\u2206\u03b4 (arcsec)\n\n50\n\n0\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\n-150\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n\u2206\u03b1 (arcsec)\n\n-50\n\n-100\n\n-150\n\nFig. 8.- Composite image of [Ar iii] (blue), [S iv] (green), and\n[Ne ii] (red), showing two pronounced neon-rich crescent-shaped\nregions to the N and S (square root scaling). Axes as Fig. 7. Also\nshown are the kinematic center of the remnant (magenta circle,\nThorstensen et al. 2001) and X-ray localization of the remnant's\ncompact object (red square, 700 to the south). Green lines indicate\nthe 1\u03c3 range of the \"kick vector\" direction of the compact object\nfrom the ejecta's expansion center: 169\u25e6 \u00b18.4\u25e6 (Fesen et al. 2006).\nThe two regions of enhanced neon abundance lie very close to this\nprojected direction. Several much smaller neon-enhanced regions\nlie in the West along the X-ray jet direction.\n\neven if the gross nucleosynthetic layering is preserved in\nthe outflow, with lighter elements overlying heavier ones,\ndiffering outflow velocities in different directions can generate an apparent mixing of layers, since different strata\nare now arriving at and passing through the reverse shock\nboundary in different regions. Combined with line of\nsight projection effects, this can profoundly complicate\n\n7\n\ninterpretation of apparent elemental mixing, a conclusion also drawn in the jet-induced explosion model of\nWheeler et al. (2008).\nA powerful example of this apparent mixing is found\nin the neon maps. Neon is among the most abundant\nelements in the carbon and oxygen shell-burning cores\nof intermediate mass supernovae progenitors (Meakin &\nArnett 2006). In contrast to the optical neon lines, which\nare highly obscured by line of sight extinction, and therefore difficult to study (e.g. Chevalier & Kirshner 1979;\nFesen 1990), the MIR neon lines are bright and readily\ndetected throughout the ejecta ring.\nA three color composite image of [Ar iii], [S iv], and\n[Ne ii] in Fig. 8 reveals two bright, crescent-shaped\nclumps of highly enhanced neon abundance to the North\nand South along the ring. Lines of Ar, Si, and S are\nvery faint in these regions, and they have excess 4.5 \u03bcm\nbrightness (Ennis et al. 2006). The blended complex\n[O iv]+[Fe ii] is strong as well, though the coarser angular\nresolution prevents completely separating the small regions from the surrounding ring material at these longer\nwavelength.\nThe [Ne ii]/[Ar iii] ratio changes dramatically - from\n0.8 \u00b1 0.4 on the rim outside of these crescent regions, to\nover 50 on the crescents themselves. Since the remnant\nregions occupied by the Ne crescents are not overly confused by overlapping Doppler structures (Lawrence et al.\n1995), the large ratio differences represent real abundance variations. Variations in abundance from optical\nemission lines of S and O are also observed at spatial resolutions of 100 (Reed et al. 1995) and down to individual\nejecta knots at the 0.00 2 level (Fesen et al. 2001).\nOverlaid on the image are the remnant expansion center of Thorstensen et al. (2001) as well as the location of\nthe X-ray compact object, which is offset from the kinematic center by \u223c700 to the South. The projected direction of motion, representing the asymmetric kick received\nby the compact object, is 169\u25e6 \u00b18.4\u25e6 (Fesen et al. 2006).\nThe symmetric neon crescents lie nearly perfectly along\nthis kick direction. Though the true-space velocity of relative motion between the compact object and kinematic\ncenter is unknown, this strongly suggests a preferred axis\nof symmetry in the outflow along this direction.\nOf obvious interest is the total emitting mass of neon in\nthe crescents. The observed line flux F of a collisionally\nexcited emission line is:\nZ\nh\u03bdAul\nF =\nfu nion dV\n(1)\n4\u03c0d2 V\nwhere Aul is the radiative rate between the two levels\ninvolved in the emission, fu is the fractional population\nof the upper level, nion is the ion density, V is the physical volume over which the emission occurs, and d is the\ndistance. Assuming the fractional density of the ion is\nconstant over the emission volume, the emitting mass of\nthe ion is therefore\nMion = mion nion V =\n\n4\u03c0d2 F\nmion\nAul fu h\u03bd\n\n(2)\n\nwhere mion is the atomic mass. We take a representative electron density on the bright rim of ne =4500 cm\u22123\nfrom the [S iii] analysis of \u00a7 4.1, and bracket our uncer-\n\n\f8\n\nSmith et al.\n\ntainty in the temperature by adopting T =5500\u20138000 K\n(see Hurford & Fesen 1996). Isolating the regions of elevated [Ne ii]/[Ar ii] using polygonal apertures, we obtain\nthe integrated fluxes for the crescents indicated in Table 2. Each crescent is approximately 0.25 pc2 in size,\nand contributes roughly 10% of the remant's total [Ne ii]\nline flux. The [Ne iii] line is also relatively strong in each\ncrescent region, but [Ne v] is very faint and not seen in\nthe Southern crescent. The [Ne v]/[Ne ii] ratio in the\nNorthern crescent is & 8\u00d7 that of the Southern region,\nalthough the velocity difference between the two lines\nat that position is & 1000 km/s, suggesting that the increased line of sight confusion in the Northern cap may\nplay a role in this discrepancy. Ne4+ contributes negligibly to the mass.\nAssuming they emit in similar volumes, the densities of\nNe++ and Ne4+ relative to Ne+ can readily be estimated\nby forming a ratio of Eq. 1 for each of the higher ionized\nspecies to the lower, which eliminates all quantities except the line flux, upper level population, radiative rate,\nand frequency. We solve for the level populations using\natomic data for neon obtained and applied in the manner\ndescribed in \u00a7 4.1. This results in nNe++ /nNe+ = 0.17 in\nboth regions, and, in the North, nNe4+ /nNe+ = 0.003.\nAssuming these ions are the dominant source of electrons, and taking the fractional density of the unseen ion\nNe+++ (which does not emit in the MIR) as 0.05, we can\nestimate\nne\nn ++\nn +++\nn 4+\n= 1 + 2 Ne + 3 Ne\n+ 4 Ne \u2248 1.5\nnNe+\nnNe+\nnNe+\nnNe+\n\n(3)\n\nUsing Eq. 2 to calculate the mass, we find roughly\n1.8\u00d710\u22124 M of neon in the crescent regions (dominated\nby Ne+ and Ne++ , and excluding neutral neon). This\nmass is comparable to that found by Arendt et al. (1999)\nin other (larger) segments of the rim. The entire ionized neon mass of the remnant, assuming an approximately constant density throughout the bright rim, is\n8.6\u00d710\u22124 M , such that roughly 20% of the neon mass\nis concentrated in two small regions covering .2% of the\nrim's area.\nThe relative abundance of Ne to Ar (neglecting neutral species of both) can be calculated using line maps\nof [Ar ii] and [Ar iii]. We assume the same temperature and densities used for neon, and calculate level\npopulations as above. The relative abundance increases\nfrom nNe /nAr =2.7 averaged over the full remnant to\nnNe /nAr =26 on the S crescent region. These likely represent lower limits on the full relative abundance, including neutral species, as the first ionization potential of Ne\n(21.6 eV) is substantially larger than that of Ar (15.8 eV),\nso that the average neutral fraction can be assumed to\nbe larger in the former.\nFlowing outwards \u223c20 degrees from the plane of the\nsky at roughly -5500 km/s (South) and +4200 km/s\n(North, see DeLaney et al. 2008), the ionized neon\nmoving in these crescent-shaped clumps represent only\n4 \u00d7 10\u22125 of the estimated 1044 J of expansion energy in\nthe entire remnant (Willingale et al. 2003). Assuming\nthe neutron star is moving in the plane of the sky, the\n7.00 0 separation it has obtained from the expansion center\nsince the explosion (Fesen et al. 2006) implies a veloc-\n\nity of 342 km/s. Further assuming it to have a mass of\n\u223c1.4M (e.g. Young et al. 2006), the momentum impulse\nimparted by the kick to the neutron star is then & 1000\u00d7\nlarger than that of either neon crescent.\nSince they represent such small fractions of the full\nejecta's kinetic energy and the momentum of the neutron star, it is unlikely that even a very large asymmetry\nin the neon crescents' initial velocities could have directly\ncontributed to the kick experienced by the compact object with respect to the expanding ejecta. In many ways,\nhowever, the infrared emitting mass of neon in the crescents must be a significant underestimate of the full column of material moving along this symmetric pair of\ndirections, with layers of heavier elements which have\nnot yet reached the reverse shock still largely unilluminated, neutral species missing from the estimate, hotter\nX-ray gas at greater radii, and other elements such as\noxygen entrained in the crescents themselves not readily\naccounted for.\nIn the final shell burning nucleosynthetic structure, the\nneon layer lies above the heavier silicon, sulfur, and argon layers (Woosley & Weaver 1995). If the gross layering\nof pre-explosion elements is preserved, the strong overabundance of neon in these crescents along the direction\nof the kick vector could in fact represent material which\nis late in meeting the reverse shock, having been accelerated to slightly slower initial speeds. If so, it could be\nexpected that the neon will gradually become less dominant as it progresses further beyond the shock and cools,\nwith sulfur and argon filling in behind it. In this sense,\nthis pair of directions is intermediate between the bright\nrim, cooling dominantly in lines of Ar, and the front and\nback surfaces along the line of sight, along which very\nlittle material has yet encountered the reverse shock.\nThe fact that the compact neon crescents are nearly\nequal in size and in mass, and are arranged symmetrically\nabout the expansion center, strongly indicates they arise\nnot from macroscopic or turbulent mixing of the ejecta\nlayers during expansion, but from a preferred axis in the\ninitial outflow configuration along this direction.\n6. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe present global low-resolution 5\u201337 \u03bcm spectral\nmaps of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant obtained\nwith Spitzer's IRS spectrograph. We detect numerous\nfine-structure emission lines arising from ions with ionization energies of 8\u2013100 eV, and strengths that vary considerably across the remnant. The observed ions represent\nsome of the most abundant species in oxygen and carbon\nshell burning supernova progenitor cores. We find:\n1. Strong interior emission of predominantly low ionization, heavy ionic species, dominated by [Si ii].\nThese regions lie inside the bright rim along the line\nof sight, and probe slower moving material which\nhas cooled from the passage of the initial outgoing\nforward shock wave, but which has not yet encountered the reverse shock.\n2. The electron density in the remnant increases\nrapidly from . 100 cm\u22123 in the unshocked interior to \u223c 104 cm\u22123 on the bright ring of emission, indicative of rapid cooling of material passing\nthrough the shock front, or significant pre-shock\ndensity inhomogeneity.\n\n\fCassiopeia A\n\n9\n\nTABLE 2\nNeon Crescent Line Fluxes\nName\n\nPosition\nJ2000\n\nArea\npc2\n\nF[Ne ii] b\n\nF[Ne iii] b\n10\u221215 W/m2\n\nF[Ne v] b\n\nNe South\nNe North\n\n23:23:31.53 +58:47:22.6\n23:23:25.88 +58:50:07.2\n\n0.33\n0.21\n\n15.9 \u00b1 0.04\n16.9 \u00b1 0.04\n\n5.59 \u00b1 0.06\n5.62 \u00b1 0.05\n\n<0.09c\n0.735 \u00b1 0.02\n\nMNe a\n10\u22125 M\n8.9 \u00b1 0.4\n9.7 \u00b1 0.5\n\na\n\nExcluding neutral neon.\nCorrected for AV = 5 magnitudes of extinction.

The ionization state increases rapidly as the ejecta\nencounter the reverse shock, with low ionization\nspecies dominating inside the shock, moderate ionization species strongest just outside the shock, and\nvery high ionization material seen in X-rays at the\ngreatest distances. These variations in post-shock\nhistory may depend on the density structure of the\ninhomogenous ejecta.\n4. Two symmetrically arranged, compact, crescentshaped clumps of material with highly enhanced\nneon abundance (> 10\u00d7 the remnant average) lie\nalong the projected direction of the \"kick vector\"\nseparating the compact object from the expansion\ncenter of the remnant, tracing a new axis of explosion asymmetry in the ejecta. Since neon is expected to arrive at the reverse shock before heavier elements like Si and S, these could represent\ndirections of reduced initial velocity, intermediate\nbetween the bright rim, and the (still) quiescent\nmaterial flowing towards the front and back faces\nof the remnant, which has yet to reach the reverse\nshock.\n\n5. Since the ionization state and density vary steeply\nwith distance from the expansion center, and have\nsuch a strong impact on the observed strength of\nindividual emission lines, the apparent macroscopic\nmixing of elements in Cas A may result from variations in initial outflow velocity rather than bulk\nturbulent redistribution of the ejecta strata. The\nsymmetry in mass and outflow direction of the neon\ncrescent regions strongly supports this interpretation.\n\nThe authors thank D.
