KISELEV\nAbstract. Using the algebraic method of Gardner's deformations for completely\nintegrable systems, we construct the recurrence relations for densities of the Hamiltonians for the Boussinesq and the Kaup-Boussinesq equations. By extending the Magri\nschemes for these equations, we obtain new integrable systems adjoint with respect to\nthe initial ones and describe their Hamiltonian structures and symmetry properties.\n\nIntroduction. In this paper we consider the most efficient way to prove the complete\nintegrability of evolutionary systems. Namely, we apply the method of Gardner's deformations [1]\u2013[6] to the Boussinesq and Kaup-Boussinesq equations. By construction,\nthe deformations consist of the (multi-)Hamiltonian scaling non-invariant parametric\nextensions E\u03b5 of the original systems E0 and the parameter-dependent Miura transformations E\u03b5 \u2192 E0 . Inverting the Miura transformations from the new systems, one\nobtains the recurrence relations for the infinite sequences of densities of the Hamiltonian functionals. We improve the result of Kupershmidt in [3] by showing that the\nsequences of conserved densities for the Boussinesq equation satisfy two different recurrence relations simultaneously. We demonstrate that the extended equations must\nnot necessarily interpolate (as it is assumed in [7]) between the equations E0 and the\nmodified systems that provide the canonical factorizations for the higher Poisson structures [8]. The recurrence relations we obtain are inherited by the modified Boussinesq [9]\nand Kaup\u2013Boussinesq [10] equations.\nNext, we separate the flows at the deformation parameters and determine the adjoint\nBoussinesq equations whose Magri schemes are coupled with the non-extended ones. We\nshow that the new systems are also integrable.\nThe examples discussed in this paper are essentially used in the general algebraic\napproach to the problem of Gardner's deformations and integrable extensions of the\nMagri schemes. This approach is based on the notion of coverings over PDE [11] and\ntheir parametric families constructed using the Fr\u00f6licher\u2013Nijenhuis bracket [12, 13, 14].\nThis will be the object of a subsequent publication.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 1 we obtain two Gardner's deformations\nfor the Boussinesq equation using the dispersionless case [15] as the starting point.\nWe specify the adjoint Boussinesq systems and discuss their integrability. In section 2\nwe construct the deformation of the Kaup-Boussinesq equation and describe the biHamiltonian adjoint system.\nDate: March 21, 2006.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35Q53, 37K05, 37K10, 37K35.

The Boussinesq equation\nFirst we consider the Boussinesq equation with dispersion and dissipation, see [3],\nUt = Vx + \u03b1 Uxx ,\n\nVt = Uxxx + UUx \u2212 \u03b1Vxx ,\n\n\u03b1 \u2208 R.\n\n(1)\n\nWe note \u0001that for any \u03b1 system (1) is transformed to the equation Utt = Uxxx * (1 \u0001+\n\u03b1) + UUx x , which is scaling-equivalent to the Boussinesq equation utt = uxxx + uux x\nwhenever \u03b1 6= \u22121. Therefore for \u03b1 6= \u22121 equation (1) is reduced to the Boussinesq\nequation\nut = vx ,\nvt = uxxx + uux .\n(2)\nIn the sequel, we consider the problem of Gardner's deformation for system (2).\nNext, we observe that a Gardner's deformation for (2) (and for the Kaup\u2013Boussinesq\nequation (7) as well) is obtained from the deformation of the dispersionless reduction by\nadding higher order terms to the equations E\u03b5 and to the Miura transformations E\u03b5 \u2192 E0 .\nIndeed, the zero order terms in the conserved densities, which are obtained recursively\nby inverting the Miura substitutions, originate from the relations for the dispersionless\nsystems. The deformation for the dispersionless Boussinesq equation has been described\nin [15]; it corresponds to the case \u03b1 = \u22121 in (1). Using this result, we construct two\ndeformations for (2) and get two distinct recurrence relations for both sequences of the\nconserved densities. Thus we improve the result of [3], where a recurrence relation for\nonly one sequence was obtained. The adjoint Boussinesq equations that appear in the\nextended systems are the by-products of our reasonings.\nTheorem 1. There are two deformations E\u03b5\u00b1 for the Boussinesq equation (2).

The densities with subscripts 3k+1, 3k+2 are trivial for all k \u2265 0.\nThe recurrence relations listed in Proposition 1 are also valid for the Hamiltonians of\nthe modified Boussinesq equation [9] which are obtained using the Miura substitutions\nto (2). The modified fields themselves do not start these sequences of conserved densities\nand thus cannot be regarded as their negative terms \u0169\u22123 , \u1e7d\u22123 .\nFurther, consider the flow at \u03b53 in the r.h.s. of equation (5); the second case related\nto (4) is analogous. We thus obtain the system\nu\u03c4 = vvx + ux uxx \u2212 uxx v \u2212 ux vx ,\nv\u03c4 = vvxx + vx2 \u2212 ux vxx \u2212 2uxx vx \u2212 uxxx v + ux uxxx + u2xx .\n\n(6)\n\nIt is Hamiltonian w.r.t. the structure (3) and the functional with density\n1\n1\n1\n1\nH\u0304 = v 3 + u2x v \u2212 ux v 2 \u2212 u3x .\n6\n2\n2\n6\nNote that system (6) is homogeneous w.r.t. the set of weights |u| = 2, |v| = 3, |\u03c4 | = \u22125,\n|x| \u2261 \u22121. We claim that equation (6) admits two infinite sequences of Hamiltonian\nsymmetries (us , vs ) = \u03c6[s] for all weights |s| = \u2212(6k + 3 \u00b1 2), k \u2208 N\u22650 . These flows\nreproduce (with proper modifications) the scheme for the symmetries of the original\nBoussinesq hierarchy. Namely, they are arranged according to the diagram\n\u03c6[1] \u2192 \u03c6[7] \u2192 \u03c6[13] \u2192 * * * ,\n\n\u03c6[5] \u2192 \u03c6[11] \u2192 * * * .\n\nThe flow \u03c6[5] is the right-hand side of the adjoint Boussinesq equation (6) itself. The\ntwo sequences of Hamiltonians for the higher symmetries of (6) are obtained from the\nfunctionals for system (5) by separating the coefficients of the highest powers of \u03b5.\nExample 1. The components \u03c61,2\n[7] of the symmetry \u03c6[7] are\n\u03c61[7] = vvxxx \u2212 ux vxxx + 2vx vxx \u2212 2uxx vxx \u2212 2uxxx vx \u2212 u4x v + ux u4x + 2uxx uxxx ,\n2\n\u2212 4uxxx vxx \u2212 3u4x vx \u2212 u5x v\n\u03c62[7] = vv4x \u2212 ux v4x + 3vx vxxx \u2212 3uxx vxxx + 2vxx\n\n+ ux u5x + 3uxx u4x + 2u2xxx.\n\n\fGARDNER'S DEFORMATIONS OF THE BOUSSINESQ EQUATIONS\n\n5\n\nThe symmetry \u03c6[11] that succeeds the equation in the hierarchy has the components\n\u03c61[11] = vv7x \u2212 ux v7x + 4vx v6x \u2212 4uxx v6x + 10vxx v5x \u2212 10uxxxv5x + 16vxxx v4x\n\u2212 16u4x v4x \u2212 16u5x vxxx \u2212 10u6x v2x \u2212 4u7x vx \u2212 u8x v + ux u8x\n+ 4uxx u7x + 10uxxxu6x + 16u4x u5x ,\n2\n\u03c6[11] = vv8x \u2212 ux v8x + 5vx v7x \u2212 5uxx v7x + 14vxx v6x \u2212 14uxxxv6x + 26vxxx v5x\n2\n\u2212 26u4x v5x + 16v4x\n\u2212 32u5x v4x \u2212 26u6x vxxx \u2212 14u7x vxx \u2212 5u8x vx\n\u2212 u9x v + ux u9x + 5uxx u8x + 14u3x u7x + 26u4x u6x + 16u25x .\n\n2.

Both Poisson structures (3) and (12) for (11) are of differential order 1.\nThis indicates that the system can be further extended with a higher order symbol\nsuch that its complete integrability is preserved. The situation is analogous to the\nGardner extension of the Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation [1]; we recall that the extension\nof KdV resulted in the dispersionless modified KdV equation whose Poisson structures\nare of order 1.\nRemark 2.
