Introduction\nAnyons \u2013 which interpolate between bosons and fermions \u2013 may exist in two dimensions\n(2D), obeying fractional statistics. Fractional statistics have recently been observed\nin experiments on the quasiparticle excitations of a 2D electron gas in the fractional\nquantum Hall (FQH) regime [1]. The anyonic quasiparticles have profound implications\nfor topological quantum states of matter [2]. For example, non-Abelian topological\norder can be studied through manipulating FQH states in a 2D electron gas. As\na consequence, the concept of anyons has become important in topological quantum\ncomputation [3, 4]. In one dimension (1D) anyons acquire a step-function-like phase\nwhen two identical particles exchange their positions. Different aspects of anyons in 1D\nhave been considered [5, 6, 7]. Among these an anyonic extension [8] of the 1D integrable\nBose gas with \u03b4-function interaction [9, 10] has attracted recent attention, including the\nbasic construction of the anyon model [11, 12, 13]. Many new results have been obtained\n\n\f2\n\n1D anyons\n\nfor this model, including the connection with Haldane [14] exclusion statistics [15, 16],\ncorrelation functions [12, 17, 18, 19], entanglement [20] and expanding anyonic fluids\n[21].\u2021\nA key feature of 1D anyons is that they retain fractional statistics in quasimomentum space and the anyonic signature of the exchange interaction \u2013 the topological\nanyonic interaction and dynamical interaction are inextricably related. 1D anyons show\nan intriguing sensitivity of the boundary condition of their wave function on the specific\nposition of the particles [11, 12, 23]. Therefore the study of exactly solvable interacting\nanyons in 1D should give insight into understanding topological effects in many-body\nphysics.\nIn this communication we propose a 1D model of anyons with \u03b4-function and\nderivative \u03b4-function interaction and solve the model by means of the co-ordinate Bethe\nansatz. The model contains an additional independent interaction parameter so that\nin principle one can study anyonic signatures through tuning the interactions. For\nthis more general model we show that the anyonic signature is inextricably related to\nthe velocities of the colliding particles and the pairwise dynamical interaction between\nidentical particles.\n2. The model\nWe consider creation and annihilation operators \u03a8\u2020 (x) and \u03a8(x) at point x, which satisfy\nthe anyonic commutation relations\n\u03a8(x)\u03a8\u2020 (y) = e\u2212i\u03baw(x,y) \u03a8\u2020 (y)\u03a8(x) + \u03b4(x \u2212 y)\n\u03a8\u2020 (x)\u03a8\u2020 (y) = ei\u03baw(x,y) \u03a8\u2020 (y)\u03a8\u2020 (x)\n\u03a8(x)\u03a8(y) = ei\u03baw(x,y) \u03a8(y)\u03a8(x).\n\n(1)\n\nThe multi-step function w(x, y) appearing in the phase factors satisfies w(x, y) =\n\u2212w(y, x) = 1 for x > y, with w(x, x) = 0. In terms of these operators the hamiltonian\ndescribing N anyons of atomic mass m confined in a length L is\nZ L\nZ L\n1\n~2\n\u2020\ndx \u03a8x (x)\u03a8x (x) + g\ndx \u03a8\u2020 (x)\u03a8\u2020 (x)\u03a8(x)\u03a8(x)\nH=\n2m 0\n2 0\nZ L\n+ i\u01eb\ndx [\u03a8\u2020 (x)\u03a8\u2020 (x)\u03a8(x)\u03a8x (x) \u2212 \u03a8\u2020x (x)\u03a8\u2020 (x)\u03a8(x)\u03a8(x)]\n(2)\n0\n\nwhere we also impose periodic boundary conditions.\nThe tunable parameters in the model are (i) g = ~2 c/m, the dynamical interaction\nstrength which drives the particles in elastic scattering through zero range contact\ninteraction, where c is the coupling constant, (ii) the nonlinear dispersion coupling\nconstant \u01eb, which describes a delta shift in collisions, and (iii) the statistical parameter\n\u03ba which varies the statistics of the particles from pure Bose statistics (\u03ba = 0) to pure\nFermi statistics (\u03ba = \u03c0). The model differs from the interacting 1D Bose gas [9, 10]\n\u2021 Further discussion of the ground state properties is given in Ref. [22].\n\n\f3\n\n1D anyons\n\nand 1D interacting anyons [8] due to the presence of the nonlinear dispersion \u01eb, i.e., the\ns-wave scattering is disturbed by a delta shift in collisions. Effectively, the 1D scattering\nlength is increased or decreased in individual pairwise collisions by this dispersion. It\nfollows that the model contains well known models as special cases in certain limits.\nFor \u03ba = 0, hamiltonian (2) reduces to that of the generalized nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nmodel [24, 26, 27], which has been studied by means of scattering Bethe ansatz in the\ncontext of soliton physics. For \u01eb = 0, it describes the model of 1D interacting anyons.\nFor \u03ba = \u01eb = 0, it reduces to the model of 1D interacting bosons, while for \u03ba = c = 0 it\nreduces to quantum derivative nonlinear Schrodinger model [28]. As we shall see, the\ngeneral model (2) exhibits more exotic dynamics than the two models corresponding to\nthe special cases \u03ba = 0 and \u01eb = 0.\nFor convenience, we hereafter set ~ = 2m = 1. We also use a dimensionless coupling\nconstant \u03b3 = c/n to characterize different physical regimes of the anyon gas, where\nn = N/L is the linear density.\n3. Bethe Ansatz\nWe first present the corresponding equation of motion \u2212i \u2202t \u03a8(x, t) = [H, \u03a8(x, t)] via the\ntime-dependent quantum fields, i.e., the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation is given by\ni\u03a8t = \u2212\u03a8xx + g\u03a8\u2020\u03a8\u03a8 + 4i\u01eb \u03a8\u2020 \u03a8\u03a8x .\n\n(3)\n\nWe note that this is an anyonic version of the generalized nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation. Restricting to its N-particle sector we can reduce the eigenvalue problem\nof the hamiltonian (2) to a quantum many-body problem. To this end, we define a\nFock vacuum state \u03a8(x)|0i = 0. Thus we can prove that the number operator N and\nmomentum operator P are conserved, where\nZ L\nN=\ndx \u03a8\u2020 (x)\u03a8(x)\n(4)\n0\nZ L\nP =i\ndx \u03a8\u2020x \u03a8(x).\n(5)\n0\n\nIn order to properly assign the anyonic phase w(xi , xj ) [8, 15, 11, 12] in the domain\nx1 < x2 < . . . < xN , we write the N-particle eigenstate as\nZ L\n1\n(6)\n| \u03a6i =\ndxN e\u2212i 2 \u03baN \u03c7(x1 . . . xN )\u03a8\u2020 (x1 ) . . . \u03a8\u2020 (xN ) | 0i\n0\n\nwhere the wavefunction amplitude is of the form\nP\nX\nw(x ,x )\n\u2212i 1 \u03ba N\nA(kP 1 * * * kP N )ei(kP 1 x1 +...+kP N xN ) .

The choice of the sign of the\nanyonic phase factor in equation (7) can be arbitrary and may lead to different boundary\nconditions [12]. Here we prefer to a fix a boundary condition where we count the anyonic\nphase factor in equation (7) through the order of the particles in the scattering states\n\n\f4\n\n1D anyons\n\n[11].

Changing the coordinates to centre of mass coordinates X = (xj + xk )/2\nand Y = xj \u2212 xk leads to the eigenvalue equation (9) in the form\n\u0013\n\u001a\u0012\n1 \u22022\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u22122 2 ***\u2212 2\n\u2212 2 ***\u2212\n\u2202x1\n2 \u2202X 2\n\u2202Y\n\u2202xN\n\u001b\n+ 2c\u03b4(Y ) + i 4\u01eb\u03b4(Y )\u2202X \u2212 E \u03c7(. . . xi . . . xj . . .) = 0.\n(11)\nIntegrating both sides of this equation with respect to Y from \u2212e to +e and taking the\nlimit e \u2192 0 gives the discontinuity condition\n\u0001\n\u2202xj \u2212 \u2202xi \u03c7(x1 , . . . , xi , xj , . . . , xN )|xj =xi +e\n\u0001\n\u2212 \u2202xj \u2212 \u2202xi \u03c7(x1 , . . . , xj , xi , . . . , xN )|xj =xi \u2212e\n= [2c + i 2\u01eb(\u2202xi + \u2202xj )]\u03c7(x1 , . . . , xi , xj , . . . , xN )|xi =xj\n\n(12)\n\non the derivative of the wavefunction.

This relation gives rise to a functional scalar\nscattering matrix which factorizes three-body scattering processes into the product\nof three two-body scattering matrices [24]. In this sense the Yang-Baxter equation\nis trivially satisfied, guaranteeing no diffraction in the scattering process [10, 24].\nConsequently the N-particle scattering amplitude can be factorized into the products\nof two-particle amplitudes. Another way to establish the integrability of the model is to\nexplicitly construct an infinite number of higher order conserved quantities, as shown\nfor the 1D Bose gas in Ref. [25].\nThe effective interaction strengths c\u2032 and \u01eb\u2032 appearing in the solution are given by\n\u01eb\nc\nand\n\u01eb\u2032 =\n.\n(14)\nc\u2032 =\ncos(\u03ba/2)\ncos(\u03ba/2)\n\n\f5\n\n1D anyons\n\nIn this model these effective coupling constants implement the transmutation between\nstatistical and dynamical interactions.\nTo complete the solution in terms of the Bethe ansatz we impose the periodic\nboundary condition \u03c7(x1 = 0, x2 . . . , xN ) = \u03c7(x2 , . . . , xN , x1 = L) on the anyonic\nwavefunction in the fundamental region 0 \u2264 x1 < x2 < . . . < xN \u2264 L. As in the\nsolution of the interacting anyon model (\u01eb = 0), this leads to the appearance of various\nphase factors [11, 12]. The wave functions for other regions can be determined through\napplication of the anyonic symmetry. The periodic boundary condition can also be\nimposed on other wavefunction arguments xi , in each case leading to the same anyonic\nphase factor in the Bethe ansatz equations (BAE) [11, 12].

The total momentum is\np=\n\nN\nX\n\nki = N(N \u2212 1)\u03ba/L.\n\n(17)\n\ni=1\n\nIn minimizing the energy we consider \u03ba(N \u2212 1) = \u03bd (mod 2\u03c0) in the phase factor.\nThe Bethe ansatz solution provides in principle the full physics of the model. For\nthe case \u03ba = 0, the BAE (16) are consistent with the scattering states constructed for\nthe generalized nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger model [24, 26]. It is also clear to see from the\nBAE (16) that the phase shift\n\u0014\n\u0015\nkj \u2212 kl + i (c\u2032 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 (kj + kl ))\n\u03b8j,l = ln\n(18)\nkj \u2212 kl \u2212 i (c\u2032 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 (kj + kl ))\ndepends essentially on the anyon parameter \u03ba, the dynamical interaction strength c and\nthe nonlinear dispersion of velocity \u01eb through the effective interactions (14). Among\nthe competing interactions, the nonlinearity parameter \u01eb is essential in determining the\nbound states. The \u03b4-function interaction strength c plays the role of a driving force in\ncollisions. However, the anyonic parameter \u03ba determines the statistical signature of the\nparticles.\n4. Preliminary analysis\nThe asymptotic behaviour of the BAE (16) reveals that bound states exist for c < 0\nand c < 2\u01eb\u03bd/L. In general, the form of the bound states appears to be extremely\ncomplicated. For example, for N = 2 and L(c \u2212 p\u01eb) \u226b 1, we have the bound state\n\b1\np \u00b1 i 12 (c \u2212 p\u01eb) . In this communication we focus on the repulsive regime, where c > 0\n2\nand |\u01eb| < c/(2p), for which the Bethe roots are real.\n\n\f6\n\n1D anyons\n\n9\n\ndistribution function g(k)\n\n8\n7\n6\n\u03b5=0.005\n\u03b5=0\n\u03b5=-0.005\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\nquasimomentum k\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFigure 1. Typical figure showing the quantum drift effect of the nonlinear dispersion\n\u01eb on the quasimomentum distribution function. Here \u03ba = 0, c = 0.04, L = 2 and\nN = 45. Drifts to the left and right are symmetric with respect to the sign of \u01eb.\n\nIn the weak coupling limit \u03b3 \u226a cos(\u03ba/2), the leading term for the ground state\nenergy, obtained from the BAE (16), is\nE0\n(N \u2212 1) \u2032\n\u03bd2\n\u2248\n(c \u2212 2\u01eb\u2032 \u03bd/L) + 2 .\n(19)\nN\nL\nL\nTo this order, for \u03ba = 0 the ground state energy is independent of the nonlinear\ndispersion \u01eb and reduces to that of weakly interacting bosons.\nHowever, the\nquasimomentum distribution\n1\ng((kj + kj+1 )/2) =\n.\n(20)\nL(kj+1 \u2212 kj )\ndeviates from the usual semicircle law [9, 30, 31] at \u01eb = 0 (see figure 1). For \u01eb > 0, the\nhigh density distribution drifts to the right hand side and the front becomes steeper as\nthe nonlinear dispersion \u01eb increases. For \u01eb < 0, the high density part drifts to the left\nhand side. The nature of this kind of quantum drift in quasimomentum space is due\nto the delta shift or equivalently the nonlinear dispersion of velocity, which effectively\nincreases or decreases the 1D scattering length in individual pairwise collisions.\nWhen the total momentum is non zero, i.e. p 6= 0, the left and right drifts are\nno longer symmetric with respect to the sign of \u01eb. Here the anyonic parameter \u03ba also\nintroduces quantum drifts in quasimomentum space. A particular example is illustrated\nin figure 2. For \u01eb > 0, the front of the distribution become very steep and the width\nbecomes narrower as \u01eb increases. The energy decreases as \u01eb increases. However, for \u01eb < 0,\nthe distribution becomes flatter. In this case, the energy increases as |\u01eb| increases.\n\n\f7\n\n1D anyons\n\n9\n\ndistribution function g(k)\n\n8\n7\n6\n\u03b5=0.005\n\u03b5=0.0025\n\u03b5=0\n\u03b5=-0.005\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n1\n0.5\n1.5\nquasimomentum k\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 2.

The drifts is no longer symmetric with\nrespect to the sign of \u01eb.\n\nIn the strong coupling limit Lc \u226b 1, one can perform the strong coupling expansion\nwith the BAE (16). In this limit the ground state of the model becomes that of the\nTonks-Girardeau gas. This is mainly because in the strong repulsive limit, the particles\nbehave like fermions in thermalized states. As a result the effect induced by the nonlinear\ndispersion of velocity is suppressed. To obtain the explicit result for the ground state\nenergy, let all quasimomenta kj shift to \u03bbj = kj \u2212 \u03bd/L and for simplicity, choose N to\nbe odd. In this limit, the quasimomenta are given explicitly by\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0013\n\u0015\u0012\n\u0014\n4nj \u01eb\u2032 \u03c0\n2\u01eb\u2032 N(N 2 \u2212 1)\u03c0 2\n2N\n2nj \u03c0\n1\u2212\n+\n1+\n(21)\n\u03bbj \u2248\nL\n(Lc\u2032 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 \u03bd)2\n3L(Lc\u2032 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 \u03bd)2\n(Lc\u2032 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 \u03bd)\nP\nwhere nj = \u2212(N \u2212 1)/2, . . . , (N \u2212 1)/2. This result indicates that N\nj=1 \u03bbj = 0. The\ncorresponding ground state energy is given by\n\u0013\u22122\n\u0012\n(N 2 \u2212 1)\u03c0 2\n2N\n\u03bd2\nE0\n\u2248\n1\n+\n.\n(22)\n+\nN\n3L2\n(Lc\u2032 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032 \u03bd)\nL2\nIt can be seen from the Bethe roots (21) that the flat fermion-like distribution\nbecomes inclined as |\u01eb| becomes large. The distribution almost linearly increases or\ndecreases depending on the direction of the current and the parameters \u03ba and \u01eb. The\nsystem is strongly collective in the Tonks-Girardeau limit.\n\n\f1D anyons\n\n8\n\n5. Concluding remarks\nWe have presented an exactly solved model of 1D anyons with general \u03b4-function and\nderivative \u03b4-function interaction. The Bethe ansatz solution has been obtained by means\nof the coordinate Bethe ansatz. We have seen that the anyonic signature is inextricably\nrelated to the nonlinear dispersion of velocity and the pairwise dynamical interaction\nbetween identical particles. Competing interactions among the anyonic parameter \u03ba\nand the strengths of the \u03b4-function interaction c and the nonlinear dispersion of velocity\n\u01eb result in more subtle bound states and scattering states. Preliminary analysis of the\nBethe Ansatz solution in the weak and strong coupling limits has revealed drifts in the\nquasimomentum distribution as a function of the nonlinear dispersion and the anyonic\nparameter.\nThe quasimomentum distribution may provide a plausible way to observe anyonic\nbehaviour in a general model with \u03b4-function and derivative \u03b4-function interaction. In\nparticular, it suggests the possibility of observing anyonic behaviour via the generalized\nnonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, perhaps with regard to the propagation of solitons\nin nonlinear media. On the other hand, the observed quantum drifts in distribution\nmay perhaps also be seen in experiments with trapped ultracold atoms in and out\nof equilibrium [32, 33]. The Bethe ansatz solution should also provide an accessible\nway to explore the dynamics in time evolution of the generalized nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation (3), just as the time-dependent dynamics of the 1D boson model has recently\nbeen investigated [34]. In addition, the investigation of fractional exclusion statistics\n[14, 15, 16, 35, 36, 37, 38] in this generalized 1D anyon gas would provide insight into\nthe influence on the statistical signature of both dynamical interaction and nonlinear\ndispersion.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported by the Australian Research Council.
