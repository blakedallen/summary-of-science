It is surely a basic concept\nof electron tunneling in nanoelectronics. Actually the electron tunneling has been applied to\nscanning tunneling microscopy, Josephson devices, superlattices, resonant tunneling devices,\nand so on [2]. When we calculate the reflectivity and transmissivity, we solve the timeindependent Shr\u00f6dinger equation to obtain the wave functions of a stationary state, and\nthen calculate the ratio of the reflected and the transmitted probability current density to\nthat of incident flux. In these calculations, a boundary condition is not varied with time.\nWe are interested in the state where the boundary condition depends on time. This\nkind of problem is of interest for instance in expanding force fields [3], or in the evolution of\nmetastable states in the early universe that is an interesting issue in cosmology [4]. We treat\nin this article two problems of a finite or an infinite potential step moving with a constant\nvelocity. These problems are the most basic concepts of quantum issues where boundary\nconditions are dependent on time.\n\nII.\n\nINFINITE POTENTIAL STEP\n\nWe solve the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation in one dimension as\ni~\n\n~2 \u2202 2 \u03a8\n\u2202\u03a8\n=\u2212\n,\n\u2202t\n2m \u2202x2\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fwith a boundary condition that an infinite potential step is located at x = vt as shown\nin FIG. 1. It is because we can not use the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation with\nthe boundary conditions that depend on time. Although this analysis has been previously\nreported by Luan et al. [5], we describe the essence of their theory here for the better\nunderstanding of the finite potential analysis described in the next section. We assume a\ngeneral solution to be\n\u03a8(x, t) = Aei(k1 x\u2212\u03c91 t) + Bei(k2 x\u2212\u03c92 t) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the two terms correspond to an incident and a reflected wave function, respectively.\nWe should pay attention to\n\n~k1\nm\n\n\u226b v that means the semi-classical point of view. The\n\nsolution (2) satisfies the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (1) only when\n\u03c91 =\n\n~ 2\n~ 2\nk1 and \u03c92 =\nk .\n2m\n2m 2\n\n(3)\n\nWe consider two boundary conditions here. One condition is that the wave function is\nzero (i.e. A+B = 0) at the boundary. The other condition should be that the first derivative\nof the wave function is also zero at the boundary. Since the position of the boundary is a\nfunction of t, the latter boundary condition can not be used in the same manner as the\nboundary is fixed with time. We then give an alternative boundary condition that the\nphases of the incident and the reflected wave functions at the boundary are the same i.e.\nk1 v \u2212 w1 = k2 v \u2212 w2 . This condition comes into\nk2 = \u2212k1 +\n\n2mv\n,\n~\n\n(4)\n\nwith the help of the equation (3). The expression (4) can be well understood as a perfect\nelastic collision in a classical mechanics. From these results, we can obtain the probability\ndensity:\n|\u03a8|2 = 4|A|2 sin2\n\nh\u0010\n\nk1 \u2212\n\ni\nmv \u0011\n(x \u2212 vt) .\n~\n\nOn the other hand, the probability current density j becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~\n\u2202\u03a8\u2217\n\u2217 \u2202\u03a8\nj =\n\u03a8\n\u2212\n\u03a8\n2mi\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u0010\nmv \u0011\n(x \u2212 vt) .\n= 4v|A|2 sin2 k1 \u2212\n~\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nA group velocity can be calculated by dividing the probability current density by the probability density. We find that the group velocity is equal to v.\n3\n\n\fV(x)\n\nregion A\n\nregion B\n\n\u03a8 inc\n\nV0\n\n\u03a8 trans\n\n\u03a8 ref\nv\n\n0\n\nvt\n\nx\n\nFIG. 2: The schematic diagram of a finite potential step.\nIII.\n\nFINITE POTENTIAL STEP\n\nWe consider the other case that the potential step is as high as V0 as shown in FIG. 2.\nThe boundary is moving toward +x with a speed of v. We should treat the two kinds of\nSchr\u00f6dinger equations in the two regions A and B as\ni~\n\n\u2202\u03a8A\n~2 \u2202 2 \u03a8A\n=\u2212\n(x \u2264 vt : region A)\n\u2202t\n2m \u2202x2\n\n(7)\n\n~2 \u2202 2 \u03a8B\n\u2202\u03a8B\n=\u2212\n+ V0 \u03a8B (vt < x : region B) ,\n(8)\n\u2202t\n2m \u2202x2\nbecause transmitted wave function can exist in this case. We assume general solutions in\nand i~\n\nthe two regions as\n\u03a8A (x, t) = Aei(k1 x\u2212\u03c91 t) + Bei(k2 x\u2212\u03c92 t)\n\nand \u03a8B (x, t) = Cei(k3 x\u2212\u03c93 t) .\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nThe first and the second terms in (9) correspond to an incident and a reflected wave function,\nrespectively. The solution (10) corresponds to the transmitted wave function. We can obtain\n~ 2\n~ 2\n~ 2 V0\nk1 , \u03c92 =\nk2 and \u03c93 =\nk +\n2m\n2m\n2m 3\n~\nin the same way as the infinite potential step. We give two boundary conditions as\n\u03c91 =\n\nA+B =C\n4\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\n\fand k1 v \u2212 \u03c91 = k2 v \u2212 \u03c92 = k3 v \u2212 \u03c93 .\n\n(13)\n\nThe condition (13) derives from our assumption that the phase of each wave function is the\nsame. From the relationship of (13) we can obtain the expressions:\nk2 = \u2212k1 +\nmv\n+\nand k3 =\n~\n\nr\u0010\n\n2mv\n~\n\nk1 \u2212\n\n(14)\n\nmv \u00112 2mV0\n.\n\u2212\n~\n~2\n\n(15)\n\nWhen we substitute v = 0 in the expressions (14) and (15), we can arrive at the well-known\nexpressions for the potential step without moving. The expression (14) describes the perfect\nelastic reflection at the boundary similarly with the case of the infinite potential step. In\norder to investigate the expression (15), we should understand k1 should be greater than\nmv/~. This is required for the collision of the incident wave function at the boundary. We\nshould pay attention to another critical point where the sign of the expression inside the\nroot in (15) is changed;\nmv\n+\nk1 =\n~\n\n\u221a\n\n2mV0\n.\n~\n\n(16)\n\nIf the k1 is greater than (16), the transmitted wave function is oscillating, otherwise is of a\ndamping oscillation. The critical wave number is dependent on v. The first term in (16) is\n\u221a \u00012\npm\nv + V0 is\nthe effect of the moving of the potential step. We can understand that\n2\n\nthe effective potential height of the step.\n\nA.\n\nThe case I (k1 > (16))\n\nWe consider the case that the transmitted wave function is oscillating. Using the expressions (11), (14) and (15), the probability density in the two regions are calculated as\n|\u03a8A |2 = |A|2 + |B|2 + A\u2217 Be\u2212i{2(k1 \u2212\n+ AB \u2217 ei{2(k1 \u2212\n\nmv\n~\n\n)(x\u2212vt)}\n\nand |\u03a8B |2 = |C|2 ,\n\n5\n\nmv\n~\n\n)(x\u2212vt)}\n(17)\n\n(18)\n\n\fwhere asterisks stand for the complex conjugate. On the other hand, the probability current\ndensities in the two regions become\n\u0001\n~ \u0002\nk1 |A|2 + k2 |B|2\nm n\nmv\nmv\n+\nAB \u2217 ei{2(k1 \u2212 ~ )(x\u2212vt)}\n~\noi\nmv\n+ A\u2217 Be\u2212i{2(k1 \u2212 ~ )(x\u2212vt)}\n\njA =\n\nand jB =\n\n~\nk3 |C|2.\nm\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nThe expression (19) describes the sum of the incident and reflected probability current\ndensities and the (20) the transmitted one. The complex coefficients of A, B, and C can be\ngenerally expressed in the form of\nA = aei\u03b8a , B = bei\u03b8b and C = cei\u03b8c ,\n\n(21)\n\nrespectively, where all variables are real values. We can describe the boundary condition of\n(12) in the other form as\na + b = c and \u03b8a = \u03b8b = \u03b8c .\n\n(22)\n\nSince |\u03a8A |2 and |\u03a8B |2 are continuous at x = vt, we obtain (a + b)2 = c2 . On the other\nhand, the continuity condition of the probability current density gives the relationship of\n2mv\nab = k3 c2 ,\n~\n\nk1 a2 + k2 b2 +\n\n(23)\n\nand we find the two expressions:\nb\nk1 \u2212 k3\n=\na\nk1 + k3 \u2212 2mv\n~\nand\n\n2k1 \u2212 2mv\nc\n~\n,\n=\na\nk1 + k3 \u2212 2mv\n~\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\nthat arrive at well-known results when the potential step does not move i.e. v = 0. By the\nway, the probability current density in the region A (the expression (19)) can be separated\nin the two components of the incident and the reflected current densities as follows:\njinc =\n\n~\nk1 |A|2\nm\n6\n\n(26)\n\n\f~ \u0002\nk2 |B|2\nand jref = \u2212\nm\nmv\nmv n\n+\nAB \u2217 ei{2(k1 \u2212 ~ )(x\u2212vt)}\n~\noi\n\u2212i{2(k1 \u2212 mv\n(x\u2212vt)}\n\u2217\n)\n~\n+ A Be\n.\nWe finally obtain reflectivity and transmissivity by dividing Jref and JB by Jinc :\n\b\n\u0001\n\u2212k2 b2 \u2212 2mv\nab cos 2 k1 \u2212 mv\n(x \u2212 vt)\n~\n~\nR=\nk1 a2\n\nand T =\n\nk 3 c2\n.\nk1 a2\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\nUsing the expressions (28) and (29), R + T can be confirmed to be unity at the boundary.\nWe can easily verify our results by considering the case of v = 0. The expressions (24)\nand (25) arrive at well-known results when v = 0. The expression of T is the same as the\none where v = 0. It is interesting that R depends on x and t. The fact derives from the\ninterference effect of the incident and reflected wave functions. The interference can occur\nonly when the potential step is moving. It is caused by the difference between the absolute\nvalues of k1 and k2 . We suppose that the effect can be applied to quantum wave interference\ndevices.\n\nB.\n\nThe case II (k1 < (16))\n\nWe consider the case that k1 is smaller than the critical wave number of (16). We pointed\nout that transmitted wave function should be of a damping oscillation scheme. The k1 should\nbe larger than mv/~ in order that the group velocity of the incident wave function is larger\nthan v to reach the boundary. We assume that k1 is far large than mv/~ from the semiclassical point of view. The different point from the case I is that the k3 becomes an complex\nnumber as\nmv\nk3 = \u03b3 + i\u03b2, where \u03b3 =\n~\nr\n\u0010\nmv \u00112\n2mV0\nand \u03b2 =\n\u2212 k1 \u2212\n> 0,\n~2\n~\n\n7\n\n(30)\n\n\fand then we obtain \u03c93 using the relationship (11),\n\u03c93 = \u03c3 + iv\u03b2,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~\n2mv\n2m2 v 2\n2\nwhere \u03c3 =\nk1 \u2212\nk1 +\n.\n2m\n~\n~2\n\n(31)\n\nBy substituting (30) and (31) for the expression (10), we obtain the wave function in the\nregion B as\n\u03a8B = Ce\u2212\u03b2(x\u2212vt)+i(\u03b3x\u2212\u03c3t) .\n\n(32)\n\nTherefore, the probability density and the probability current density in the region B are\nexpressed as\n|\u03a8B |2 = |C|2 e\u22122\u03b2(x\u2212vt)\nand jB =\n\n~\n|C|2 \u03b3e\u22122\u03b2(x\u2212vt)\nm\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\nDividing (34) by (33) shows us that the group velocity is v. On the basis of the same\ndiscussion of (21) and (22) before, we can obtain (a + b)2 = c2 also in this case, and draw\nthe relationship of\nk1 a2 + k2 b2 +\n\n2mv\nab = \u03b3c2\n~\n\n(35)\n\nin stead of (23). Using a + b = c, we get simple relations of\nb\nc\n= 1,\n= 2.\na\na\n\n(36)\n\nWe substitute (36) for (28) and (29) to arrive at\nR=1\u22124\n\n\u0010\nmv\nmv \u0011\n(x \u2212 vt)\ncos2 k1 \u2212\n~k1\n~\n\nT =4\n\nmv \u22122\u03b2(x\u2212vt)\ne\n.\n~k1\n\n(37)\n\n(38)\n\nWe can confirm easily that R + T = 1 at the boundary and that R = 1 and T = 0 if v = 0.\nThe semi-classical condition denoted in the previous section plays an important role here.\nIt ensures that T is less than unity.\n\n8\n\n\fIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe investigated the characteristics of the wave function and probability current density in\na system with the potential step moving toward +x direction at a constant velocity v. Since\nthe position of the boundary depends on time, we solve the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation in one dimension. We used our boundary condition that the phases of the wave\nfunctions at the boundary are the same instead of ordinary condition that the first derivative\nof the wave function is the same at the boundary. We found the relation between the wave\nnumbers of the incident and the reflected wave functions. The absolute value of the wave\nnumber is changed when the wave function is reflected at the boundary. When the potential\nstep is finite, the wave function can be transmitted if the energy of the incident wave function\nis larger than the effective potential height that is depend on v.\n\n[1] L. I.
