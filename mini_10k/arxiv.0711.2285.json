Introduction\nMeasurement of the CKM angle \u03b3/\u03c63 is challenging. Several methods have been proposed using B \u2213 \u2192\nDK \u2213 decays; 1) the Gronau-London-Wyler (GLW)\nmethod [1] where the D decays to CP eigenstates 2)\nthe Atwood-Dunietz-Soni (ADS) method [2] where the\nD decays to flavor eigenstates and 3) the Dalitz plot\nmethod [3, 5] where the D decays to a three-body final state. This latter method has been used recently\nby CLEO to measure the K \u2217 K strong phase via the\nthree-body decay D0 \u2192 K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 [6]. Uncertainties\ndue to charm contribute to each of these methods.\nThe CLEO-c physics program includes a variety of\ncharm measurements that will improve the determination of \u03b3/\u03c63 from the B-factory experiments, BaBar\nand Belle. The pertinent components of this program\nare improved constraints on charm mixing amplitudes\n- important for GLW, measurement of the relative\nstrong phase \u03b4 between D0 and D0 decay to K + \u03c0 \u2212 important for ADS, and studies of charm Dalitz plots\ntagged by hadronic flavor or CP eigenstates. The total number of charm mesons accumulated at CLEO-c\nwill be much smaller than the samples already accumulated by the B-factories. However, quantum correlations in the DD\u0304 system from \u03c8(3770) provides a\nunique laboratory in which to study charm.\nThe decay with the largest branching fraction relevant to the determination of \u03b3/\u03c63 D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .\nRecently Babar [7] and Belle [8] have reported \u03b3 =\n\u25e6\n(92 \u00b1 41 \u00b1 11 \u00b1 12)\u25e6 and \u03c63 = (53+15\n\u221218 \u00b1 3 \u00b1 9) , respectively, where the third error is the systematic error\ndue to modeling of the Dalitz plot.\nBoth D0 and D0 populate the Dalitz plots\nKS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , (as well as \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , K + K \u2212 \u03c0 0 and\nKS0 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 ) and so can be used in the determination of\n\u03b3/\u03c63 which exploit the interference between b \u2192 c\u016bs\n(B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 ) and b \u2192 uc\u0304s (B \u2212 \u2192 D0 K \u2212 ) where\nthe former process is real and the latter is proportional\nto \u223c e\u2212i\u03b3 [9]. Studying CP tagged Dalitz plots allows\na model independent determination of the relative D0\nand D0 phase across the Dalitz plot. We describe this\ntechnique in the following sections.\n\n2. Determining \u03b3/\u03c63 From B Decays\nOur analysis follows the work outlined in [3], [5],\nand [4]. We consider the decay process B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 ,\nfollowed by the three-body decay D \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . Assuming no CP violation, we define the decay amplitudes for the D0 and D0 to be\nA(D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ; x, y) \u2261 fD (x, y)\nA(D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + ; x, y) \u2261 fD (y, x).\n\n(1)\n\nSensitivity to the angle \u03c63 comes from the interference\nof the neutral D mesons from B \u00b1 \u2192 DK \u00b1 . Since the\nD meson is in a linear combination of flavor states,\nthe amplitude for a D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 event originating\nfrom a B decay is then\nA(B \u2212\u2192 (KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )D K \u2212 ) \u221d fD + rB ei\u03b8\u2212 fD ,\n\n(2)\n\nup to an overall normalization. The angle \u03b8 is defined as \u03b8\u00b1 \u2261 \u03b4B \u00b1 \u03c63 . Here \u03b4B is the strong phase\ndifference between color-suppressed and favored amplitudes, whilst rB is the ratio between the colorsuppressed to favored amplitudes. Theoretical estimates place rB between 0.1-0.2 [11]. This has been\nconfirmed by BaBar (rB = 0.12 \u00b1 0.08 \u00b1 0.03(syst)\n\u00b1 0.04(model), [7]) and Belle (rB = 0.16 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b1\n0.01(syst) \u00b1 0.05(model), [8]).\nThe D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plot is divided into 2N\nbins, symmetric under exchange of x and y. The bins\nare indexed from \u2212i to i, excluding zero, as in shown\nin Fig 1. The coordinate exchange x \u2194 y thus corresponds to the exchange of bins i \u2194 \u2212i. For simplicity\nwe ignore the effects of efficiency and background in\nthe Dalitz plot. The number of events in the i-th bin\nof the KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plot from a D decay is then\nexpressed as\nZ\n2\nKi = AD\n|fD (x, y)| dx dy = AD Fi .\n(3)\nDi\n\nThe interference between the D0 and D0 amplitudes\nis parametrized by the two quantities\nZ\n1\n\u2217\nRe [fD (x, y)fD\n(y, x)] dx dy (4)\nci \u2261 p\nFi F\u2212i Di\n\n\f2\n\nProceedings of the CHARM 2007 Workshop, Ithaca, NY, August 5-8, 2007\nIn terms of this amplitude the number of events in the\ni-th bin of a CP -tagged Dalitz plot is\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\nMi\u00b1 = hCP \u00b1 Ki \u00b1 2ci Ki K\u2212i + K\u2212i , (8)\nwhere hCP \u00b1 is a normalization factor.\nThe expression given above for Mi\u00b1 can be used to\nmeasure ci directly, even if only one type of CP tag\nis reconstructed. Care must be taken to use the corresponding value of hCP \u00b1 as defined above. However,\nif samples of both CP parities are available we can\ncombine the expressions for Mi+ and Mi\u2212 to get the\nfollowing equation\n\u0001\n1 Mi\u2212 \u2212 Mi+ (Ki + K\u2212i )\n\u0001 p\nci =\n,\n(9)\n2 Mi+ + Mi\u2212\nKi K\u2212i\n\nWe thus have an expression for measuring ci simply by\ncounting events within the bins of flavor-tagged and\nCP -tagged Dalitz plots.\nAt CLEO-c we produce D0 D0 pairs from the decay of a \u03c8(3770) in a definite eigenstate of C = \u22121.\nIgnoring both the effects of CP violation, the double\ntag rate for final states |1i and |2i is given by\n\nFigure 1: Binning of the D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plot.\n\nand\n1\nsi \u2261 p\nFi F\u2212i\n\nZ\n\n\u2217\nIm [fD (x, y)fD\n(y, x)] dx dy,\n\nDi\n\n\u22122rB\n\n2\nrB\nK\u2212i\n\np\nKi K\u2212i (ci cos \u03b8\u2212 \u2212 si sin \u03b8\u2212 ) , (6)\n\nagain up to an overall normalization. It is important to note that ci and si depend only on the D\ndecay. These are the quantities that we measure using CLEO-c data. Although in principle they could\nbe left as free parameters in a D \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz\nplot analysis from B \u00b1 decays, their values can be more\nprecisely determined from correlated DCP decays produced at CLEO-c.\nThus, we can constrain \u03b8\u00b1 , and in turn \u03b3/\u03c63 , if we\nknow Ki , ci , and si . The Ki can be easily determined\nusing flavor-tagged D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plot. In the\nnext section we show how the ci can be obtained using\nbinned, CP -tagged D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plots.\n\n3. Measuring ci From CP -Tagged D\nDecays\nFor D mesons that decay into a CP eigenstate, we\nwrite the initial state of the D as a linear combination\nof flavor eigenstates\n1\nfCP \u00b1 (x, y) = \u221a |fD (x, y) \u00b1 fD (y, x)| .\n2\n\n(10)\n\nA(1, 2) \u2261 h1|D0 ih2|D0 i \u2212 h1|D0 ih2|D0 i\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\n\nwhere the integral is performed over a single bin. The\nnumber of events in the i-th bin of the KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz\nplot from a B decay is then\nNi = K i +\n\n\u0393(1, 2) = |A(1, 2)|2 + (mixing terms),\n\n(5)\n\n(7)\n\nFor the time being we ignore the effects of correlations\nand mixing in the K\u03c0 tagged Dalitz plot. This is not\nexpected to make a significant difference for the K\u03c0\n2\nmode, as terms proportional to rK\u03c0 \u2243 0.06 and rK\u03c0\nare negligible.\n\n3.1. Optimized Binning\nAlthough the quantity si can only be measured using a KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 vs. KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 double Dalitz analysis [4],\nit can still be approximated from a single Dalitz plot if\nthe binning is fine enough. If the bins are small enough\nthat the phase difference and the amplitude remains\nconstant across each bin, the strong phase parameters become cip= cos (\u03b4D ), si = sin (\u03b4D ), so that the\nequality si = 1 \u2212 c2i is true. It has been shown [3]\nthat this equality holds for 200 or more bins, which is\nclearly not feasible for the number of DCP tags produced at CLEOc. In order to circumvent this problem,\nBondar has proposed an alternate, model-dependent\nmethod for binning the KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plot[4]. The\noptimal choice depends on the D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 model.\nIn this analysis we use the isobar model amplitude obtained from the most recent Belle \u03c63 Dalitz analysis\n[8].\nFrom the consideration above it is clear that a good\napproximation to the optimal binning is the one obtained from the uniform division of the strong phase\n\n\fProceedings of the CHARM 2007 Workshop, Ithaca, NY, August 5-8, 2007\ndifference \u03b4D . We thus take the definition of i-th bin\nto be\n2\u03c0(i \u2212 1/2)/N \u2264 \u03b4D (x, y) < 2\u03c0(i + 1/2)/N.\n\n(12)\n\n3\n\nS\n\nM2(K \u03c0-)\n\nAn example of such a binning with N = 8 is shown in\nFig. 2.\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nM2(K \u03c0+)\nS\n\nFigure 2: Divisions of the D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plot with\nuniform binning of \u2206\u03b4D strong phase difference with N =\n8.\n\n4. Event Selection\n4.1. Double-Tagged D \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nEvents\nThis analysis uses a combination of two-body CP\nand flavor tags. Since the neutral D mesons are produced at \u03c8 \u2032 (3770) threshold they are correlated in a\nC = \u22121 state. If mixing is ignored we can determine\nwhether the parent particle was a D0 or D0 , up to\nDCS contributions. Similarly, if CP violation is ignored, then the D mesons must be in eigenstates of\nopposite CP [10].\nTo determine the flavor of the D meson, we tag\nD0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events with the two-body D0 \u2192\nK + \u03c0 \u2212 mode. 1 We use the two CP -even tags K + K \u2212\nand \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and the two CP -odd tags KS \u03c0 0 and KS \u03b7.\nWe introduce two quantities that are reconstructed\non both sides of a double-tagged decay. p\nThe beamconstrained mass is defined as Mbc \u2261\nEb2 \u2212 p2D ,\n\n1 The inclusion of charge-conjugate modes is implied\nthroughout our analysis.\n\nwhere Eb is the beam energy and p2D is the square\nof the reconstructed 3-momentum of the D meson.\nWe require that the beam-constrained mass of the\nreconstructed candidate is within 3\u03c3 of the nominal\nD mass, which corresponds to a selection criteria of\n1.8603 \u2264 Mbc \u2264 1.8687 GeV. The other quantity is\nthe energy difference between the beam and the reconstructed D, defined as \u2206E \u2261 Ebeam \u2212 ED . We\napply a selection criteria of |\u2206E| \u2264 30 MeV to all\nD0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 candidates.\nAdditional selection criteria are placed on the duaghter particles to ensure basic track quality. For example, we select pion track momenta between 0.05 \u2264\np \u2264 2.0 GeV. Both signal and tagging modes containing a KS are selected to be within 3\u03c3 of the KS mass,\nwhich corresponds to \u00b17.5 MeV from the central KS\nmass value of 497.6 MeV.\nWe only reconstruct KS particles that decay\nthrough the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 channel; we do not attempt to reconstruct KS \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . Fake KS candidates can be\nmisreconstructed from combinatoric \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 pairs. To\nsuppress these events we apply a selection criteria on\nthe flight significance fs \u2265 0 to our KS candidates.\nAdditionally, we require that the \u03c0 0 mass falls within\n3\u03c3 of its nominal value.\n\n4.2. Double-Tagged D \u2192 KL\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nEvents\nFor D0 \u2192 KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays we require the same\nselection criteria on charged pions and \u03c0 0 candidates\nas those described for D0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decays. However, because of the large flight distance of the KL ,\nthe KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 signal is reconstructed using a missing\nmass technique. We require the signal side to have\nexactly two charged tracks. We also apply \u03c0 0 , \u03b7, and\nKS vetoes. Using the measured momentum of the\ntagged D, we compute the missing momentum and\nenergy on the signal side. We require that the missing\nmass squared satisfies the condition 0.21 \u2264 m2 \u2264 0.29\nGeV2 . The background for D0 \u2192 KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 mode is\napproximately 5%.\n\n4.3. Double-Tagged KL\u03c0 0 vs. KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nWe can increase our statistics by reconstructing\nD0 \u2192 KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 events tagged with the CP -even\nmode KL \u03c0 0 . We require zero tracks and exactly one\n\u03c0 0 candidate on the tag side. We veto events containing \u03b7 candidates, and impose similar criteria on the\nKL missing mass as described above.\nThe final yields for all tag modes are summarized\nin Table I\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nProceedings of the CHARM 2007 Workshop, Ithaca, NY, August 5-8, 2007\n\nTable I Yields for CP-tagged KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in\n398 pb\u22121 data, by tag mode.\nTag Mode KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nK+K\u2212\n61\n194\n\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212\n33\n90\nKS \u03c0 0\n108\n263\nKS \u03b7\n29\n21\n0\nKL \u03c0\n190\n-\n\n5. Combining KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nThe tagged KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 Dalitz plots are included to increase the statistical accurancy of this analysis. However, if we naively combine the Dalitz plots with KS\nand KL we will find our measurement of ci to be biased. We must first account for the phenomenological\ndifferences between the KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 models.\nSince the KS and KL mesons are of opposite CP ,\nthe doubly-Cabibbo suppressed amplitudes in each\nDalitz plot will contribute with opposite signs. We\ncan see this by inspecting the D0 decay amplitude for\neach each Dalitz plot\ni\n1 h\nA(KS \u03c0\u03c0) = \u221a A(K 0 \u03c0\u03c0) + A(K 0 \u03c0\u03c0)\n2\ni\n1 h\nA(KL \u03c0\u03c0) = \u221a A(K 0 \u03c0\u03c0) \u2212 A(K 0 \u03c0\u03c0) (13)\n2\n(14)\n\nFigure 3: Values for ci numerically determined from our\nmodel. KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 values are in red, KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 in blue. In\neach bin the values for ci are systematically larger for\nKL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . The error bars represent the uncertainties in\nthe KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 model parametrization.\n\n6. Results\nWe report the difference in ci between KS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\nand KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 as measured in 398 pb\u22121 of data. In\nFig. 4 we compare the ci differences calculated from\nour model and measured from data. The error bars\n\nThe effect of this relative minus sign is to introduce a 180\u25e6 phase for all DCS K \u2217 resonances in the\nKL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 model. We can use U -spin symmetry to\nrelate the amplitudes for resonances of definite CP\neigenvalue. We find that these states aquire a factor\nof rK ei\u03b4K \u2243 \u2212 tan \u03b8C , where \u03b8C is the Cabibbo angle.\nIn our study we mulitply all DCS amplitudes in the\nKL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 model by -1. From this \"base\" model we fix\nrK = 0.06 for each CP eigenstate, then vary the phase\n\u03b4K between 0 and 2\u03c0. For each bin we then find the\nlargest resulting deviation in ci , and report this value\nas the systematic uncertainty in the KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 model.\nTo better understand the difference between the\nKS \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 models, we compare the numerically calculated values of ci in each Dalitz plot.\nWe find that the value for ci is systematically larger in\neach bin for KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . In Fig. 3 we can see that the\ndifference is significantly larger than the systematic\nuncertainty in our KL \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 model.\n\nFigure 4: The difference in KS \u03c0\u03c0 and KL \u03c0\u03c0 values of ci ,\nnumerically determined from our model (black) and measured in 398 pb\u22121 of data (green).
