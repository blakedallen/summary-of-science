INTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years new solutions to the hierarchy problem based on the presence of extra\nspace-time dimensions have been proposed. In Ref. [1,2] the weakness of gravity compared\nto the gauge interactions was explained with the aid of large volume of flat extra dimensions\nin which only gravitons propagate. On the other hand, if the space is curved along the extra\ndimension, one can achieve a large hierarchy even for a small size of the extra dimension [3].\nThe setup proposed by Randall and Sundrum involved a slice of AdS5 space-time terminated\nby two branes: the Planck brane and the TeV brane where the Standard Model fields were\nassumed to live. The hierarchy appears due to the presence of a large warp factor which\nsuppresses all the mass scales (in particular the fundamental (cutoff) scale) on the TeV\nbrane. At the same time, the gravitational interactions are weak since the massless graviton\nmode has a small overlap of the wave function with the TeV brane matter.\nRandall and Sundrum proposed this setup as an alternative to the MSSM or the large\nextra dimensions. However, the question remains whether the model can be reconciled\nwith the gauge coupling unification as the low-energy effective theory breaks down close to\nTeV energies and quantum gravity effects emerge. There seems no chance to embed in the\nRandall-Sundrum model the triumph of gauge coupling unification in the MSSM since there\nis no huge scale difference which allows three different couplings to be unified with large log\ncorrections.\nHowever recently it has been realized that the Randall-Sundrum model can be made\ncompatible with the large-scale unification if the Standard Model gauge fields are allowed to\npropagate in the bulk AdS5 space-time. The question of the running of gauge couplings in\nAdS5 was first studied by Pomarol [4] who showed, that if the cutoff of the theory is below\nthe curvature scale of AdS5 , logarithmic running occurs instead of linearly divergent power\nlaw which happens in flat 5D. In Pauli-Villars regularization all the heavy Kaluza-Klein\nmodes are paired up with the modes of the regulating ones and thus they give a negligible contribution for the running. The large log correction arises due to the differences of\nthe infrared(IR) cutoff scale \u03bc and the ultraviolet(UV) cutoff given by the regulator mass.\nRandall and Schwartz [5,6] used a different prescription inspired by AdS/CFT correspondence in order to show the logarithmic running of the bulk gauge couplings. A position\ndependent momentum cutoff was used as a regularization and, as a consequence, the gauge\ncoupling got logarithmic corrections as long as the cutoff was below the scale of the curvature. Choi, Kim and Kim [7] derived general running equations for the gauge couplings\nin an orbifold of AdS5 in the supersymmetric setup based on holomorphy. Dimensional\nregularization [8,9] shows the momentum dependence (log p), the radius dependence (log R)\nand the divergent structure (log \u039b or log \u03bc) separately. Following this approach, one can\nderive all the radius dependence and the momentum dependence of the gauge couplings by\nreading the Kahler metric and considering possible threshold corrections in the presence of\nthe curvature. Radius running [9] is a nice way to reach the coupling defined at UV. In [10],\nmore detailed analysis was done using the Pauli-Villars regularization and it confirmed the\nresults of Pomarol. Holographic evolution of gauge couplings was discussed in [11].\nIn this paper we approach the problem using the deconstruction setup. In Refs. [12,13]\nit was observed that gauge theories in four dimensions with the gauge group SU(Nc )N\nand scalars (link-Higgs fields) in bifundamental representations appear to be equivalent to a\n2\n\n\fhigher dimensional SU(Nc ) theory in the flat background 1 . The correspondence holds below\nsome deconstruction scale v set by the expectation values of the link-Higgs fields that break\nthe group SU(Nc )N to its diagonal subgroup. Below v the spectrum and interactions of the\nfour dimensional degrees of freedom are analogous to that of the Kaluza-Klein(KK) modes\nof gauge bosons propagating in extra dimensions. Above the scale v, a deconstruction model\ncan be considered as a (possibly renormalizable) UV completion of the corresponding extra\ndimensional theory. Hence, there appeared a new possibility to study the extra dimensional\nphysics using the standard tools of four dimensional Yang-Mills theories. Recently it has\nbeen noticed that also gauge fields propagating in a curved background can be described\nby four dimensional gauge theories [17] (see also [18]). This can be simply achieved using\nthe analogous set-up as that of [12,13] but with non-universal vevs of the link-Higgs fields.\nThus, deconstruction can also help to understand the physics of the curved space.\nDeconstruction is used in our paper as an alternative regularization method and is compared to other regularizations. We show that the Renormalization Group(RG) running\nequation is directly related to the boundary condition for the gauge couplings that we start\nwith, and is highly dependent on the UV completion. We restrict the study to the region in\nwhich the cutoff scale \u039b (the inverse of the lattice size) is lower than the curvature scale k\n(\u039b \u226a k) though a more general study is possible with the aid of numerical analysis for \u039b \u223c k.\nThe other limit (the cutoff scale is much higher than the curvature scale, \u039b \u226b k) is very similar to the flat space since we can not feel the presence of the curvature for \u039b \u226b k. There are\ntwo interesting observations for \u039b \u226a k. Firstly, it is shown that in deconstruction there are\nless heavy states than in the low energy effective description of the Randall-Sundrum(RS)\nmodel and the number of KK modes increases logarithmically rather than linearly in energy\nscale. This makes the running of the gauge coupling soften compared to the flat case and\nthe rather mild running instead of power law running is expected. Secondly, the running of\nthe gauge coupling above TeV is not a running of the zero mode but rather a running of\nthe part of the gauge coupling existing near Planck brane. This is related to the definition\nof the Wilsonian gauge coupling from which we can find the relation with the low energy\ncoupling measured by experiment. The natural Wilsonian gauge coupling at \u039b is defined at\ndifferent scales for different positions along the fifth dimension (which is \u039b for Planck brane\nand is \u039be\u2212\u03c0kR for TeV brane), and we can not apply the zero mode running formula used in\nthe flat space extra dimension. This reduces the effective number of KK modes at a given\nenergy scale from log E to 1, and we get the running formula which is just the same as the\nfour dimensional one.\nII. SETUP\n\nIn this section we summarize the correspondence between the 5D gauge theories and the\ndeconstruction models. In a warped background with the metric ds2 = a2 (y)\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212dy 2\nthe 5D Yang-Mills action reads:\n\n1 Similar\n\nmodels had been studied previously for different reasons, see [14,15,16].\n\n3\n\n\f\u03b4S5D =\n\nZ\n\n4\n\ndx\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0R\n\n0\n\n1\ndyTr \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + a2 (y)F\u03bc5 F\u03bc5 ,\n2\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the field strength is defined as F\u03b1\u03b2 = 2 g15 \u2202[\u03b1 (g5 A\u03b2] ) + ig5 [A\u03b1 , A\u03b2 ] and g5 is the gauge\ncoupling (here we allow g5 to be position dependent). One can discretize the compact fifth\ndimension into N equally sized intervals (yi , yi+1), with the latticeR spacing \u2206y \u2261 yi+1 \u2212 yi =\nP\nR\n. The integral over the y coordinate is traded for the sum, dy \u2192 N\ni=1 \u2206y, and the\nN\nA\u03bc,i+1 \u2212A\u03bc,i\nderivates along the fifth dimension are discretized as \u22025 A\u03bc |yi \u2192\n.\n\u2206y\nThe deconstruction models which mimic the 5D SU(Nc ) gauge theories compactified\non the orbifold S1 /Z2 involve N copies of SU(Nc ) group with the gauge couplings gi (i =\n1, * * * , N) and link Higgs fields Qi (i = 1, * * * , N \u2212 1). The links are bifundamental under\nSU(Nc )i \u00d7 SU(Nc )i+1 , thus they are represented by Nc \u00d7 Nc complex matrices. The action\nis:\nS4D =\n\nZ\n\nN\nX\n\n1\nTr \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd,i F\u03bc\u03bd,i + 2D\u03bc Q\u2020i D\u03bc Qi + V (Qi )\ndx\n2\ni=1\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(2)\n\nThe link-Higgs field can be conveniently split as Qi = \u221a12 (\u03a3i + iGi ). The scalar potential\nV (Qi ) is necessary go give the link-Higgs fields the desired pattern of vacuum expectation\nvalues, but the details of it are not relevant for us.\nWhen the link-Higgs bosons acquire vacuum expectation values, hQi i = vi , the full gauge\nsymmetry is broken down to the diagonal subgroup and the usual Higgs mechanism gives\nmasses to the gauge fields corresponding to broken generators. The action then reads:\nS4D =\n\nR\n\nd4 x\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2020\n1\ni=1 Tr \u2212 2 F\u03bc\u03bd,i F\u03bc\u03bd,i + Z\u03bc,i Z\u03bc,i\n\nPN\n\n\u0011\n\nZ\u03bc,i = (\u2202\u03bc Gi \u2212 i\u2202\u03bc \u03a3i + vi (gi A\u03bc,i \u2212 gi+1 A\u03bc,i+1 ) + gi A\u03bc,i (\u03a3i + iGi ) \u2212 (\u03a3i + iGi )gi+1 A\u03bc,i+1 ) (3)\nIn non-supersymmetric models the fields \u03a3i have no interpretation in terms of 5D degrees of\nfreedom2 . Thus they should be given a large mass (by adjusting the scalar potential V (Qi )\nappropriately) and decoupled from the low-energy theory. In the following we assume that\nthis step has been done and neglect \u03a3 in our analysis. The remaining terms in Z\u03bc,i can be\narranged as follows:\nZ\u03bc,i\n\ngi A\u03bc,i \u2212 gi+1 A\u03bc,i+1\n= \u2202\u03bc Gi + vi gi\n+ igi [A\u03bc,i , Gi ] \u2212 iGi (gi+1 A\u03bc,i+1 \u2212 gi A\u03bc,i )\ngi\n\n!\n\n(4)\n\nNow we can do the following identification between the degrees of freedom in our deconstruction model and the 5D gauge theory:\ng5 (yi ) \u221a\n\n1\n\u2192 gi\n\u2206y\n\nq\n\nA\u03bc (yi ) \u2206y \u2192 A\u03bc,i\n\n2 In\n\nsupersymmetric models they are matched to the real scalar component of the 5D N = 2 gauge\nmultiplet [19].\n\n4\n\n\fq\n\nA5 (yi ) \u2206y \u2192 Gi\n\na(yi )\n\u2192 gi vi\n\u2206y\n\n(5)\n\nThe problem at what scale should this matching actually be done will be discussed later on.\n2\nThe correspondence between the 4D part of the field strengths F\u03bc\u03bd\nin the two theories is\nobvious.

Thus, in the deconstruction models, the\nrole of the fundamental scale is played by the inverse of the lattice spacing, \u039b \u223c (\u2206y)\u22121 .\nFor vi = v, gi = g the deconstruction model describes, at low energies, the same physics\nas that of the 5D gauge theory in the flat background [12,13]. In this case it is straightforward\nto diagonalize the mass matrix for the gauge bosons and the spectrum turns out to be\n\nmn = 2gv sin(\n\nn\u03c0\n),\n2N\n\n(n = 0, * * * , N \u2212 1).\n\n(7)\n\nFor n \u226a N, we obtain the well-known spectrum of Kaluza-Klein modes of a 5D gauge theory\nN\n. Thus there are three distinctive\ncompactified on S 1 /Z2 , mn = Rn , with the radius R = \u03c0gv\ngv\u03c0\nenergy scales. Below the scale N the theory is analogous to the ordianary 4D gauge theory.\nIn the range from gv\u03c0\nup to the inverse lattice spacing gv the heavy gauge bosons can be\nN\nseen and the physics is analogous to that of the 5D gauge theory. Finally, above gv the\ntheory is an unbroken 4D gauge theory with the product group SU(Nc )N . In this energy\nrange the deconstruction model can be considered as one of many possible UV completions\nof the 5D gauge theory with the cut-off \u039b = gv. Running of the gauge couplings in 'flat'\ndeconstruction models was studied in [20,21,22].\nIt was noticed in [17] that if the quantity gi vi depends on i, such models correspond to\n5D gauge theories with a non-trivial warp factor a(y). In particular choosing gi = g and\nvi = v\u03b5i , \u03b5N \u2248 10\u221216 , we are able to describe the physics of gauge fields (with a constant\ngauge coupling) living in the Randall-Sundrum background. One can understand it by\nnoting, that gi vi plays the role of an effective lattice spacing measured by the warped metric.\nIn consequence, the scale at which we switch from 5D description to the UV completion\ndepends on the position in the group space. This is similar in spirit to the notion of a\nposition dependent momentum cut-off introduced in [5].\n\n5\n\n\fFIGURES\n\n\u03a61 = v 1\nG1\n\nG2\n\u03a62 = v 2\nG(2)\n\nG3\n\nG(3)\n\n\u03a6N\u22121 = vN\u22121\nG(N\u22121)\n\nGN\n\nG(N)\nFig 1.

However, for \u03b5 \u226a 1, we can diagonalize the mass matrix\nstep by step and the result remains trustworthy. Therefore, from now on, the case with\n\u03b5 \u226a 1 is considered. In such case the following simple picture holds. At the scale v1 the first\ntwo groups SU(Nc )1 \u00d7 SU(Nc )2 are broken to the diagonal group SU(Nc )(2) , at the scale v2\nSU(Nc )(2) \u00d7 SU(Nc )3 breaks to SU(Nc )(3) and so on. We use the notation SU(Nc )i for the\ni-th gauge group of the original product, SU(Nc )(i) for the unbroken gauge group after the\nHiggsing of SU(Nc )(i\u22121) \u00d7 SU(Nc )i and we denote g(i) the corresponding gauge coupling.\nFig. 1 shows the moose diagram.\nThus, for \u03b5 \u226a 1, the problem is reduced to diagonalizing 2 \u00d7 2 matrices and the eigenvalues are easily determined. First we diagonalize the part involving A\u03bc,1 and A\u03bc,2 and\nthe eigenvalues are O(gv\u03b5) and O(gv\u03b52). One state with O(gv\u03b5) eigenvalue is isolated and\nremains as a true eigenstate while the other with O(gv\u03b52) has a mixing term with A\u03bc,3 .\nWe can do the same procedure iteratively and finally we obtain the spectrum O(gv\u03b5N \u22121)\ncorresponding to the final Higgsing scale. Exact calculation shows that there is always a\nzero-mode eigenstate corresponding to the full diagonal subgroup. This is easily seen from\nthe fact that the determinant of the original mass matrix is zero or by finding the zero mode\neigenstate given as\n7\n\n\fN\n1 X\n\u221a\nA\u03bc,i ,\nA(0)\n=\n\u03bc\nN i=1\n\n(10)\n\nwhich reflects that the zero mode of the vector field is constant along the extra dimension\nin AdS5 orbifold. For other higher mode eigenvalues, the eigenstates are given as3\n1\nA\u03bc(N \u22121) = \u221a (A\u03bc,1 \u2212 A\u03bc,2 )\nup to O(\u03b52 ),\n2\n1\n\u22122)\nA(N\n= \u221a (A\u03bc,1 + A\u03bc,2 \u2212 2A\u03bc,3 )\nup to O(\u03b52 ),\n\u03bc\n6\n***\n1\n(A\u03bc,1 + * * * + A\u03bc,j \u2212 jA\u03bc,j+1 )\nup to O(\u03b52 ),\nA\u03bc(N \u2212j) = q\nj(j + 1)\n***\n1\nA(1)\n(A\u03bc,1 + * * * + A\u03bc,N \u22121 \u2212 (N \u2212 1)A\u03bc,N )\nup to O(\u03b52 ).\n\u03bc = q\n(N \u2212 1)N\n\n(11)\n\nA\u03bc(N \u2212j) has an eigenvalue of order O(v\u03b5j ) and the 5D interpretation is clear. For higher\nmodes (mn \u223c v), the corresponding wave functions are localized at the Planck brane. This\nis exactly the position dependent momentum cutoff for the gauge fields which Randall and\nSchwartz introduced for the calculation of the gauge coupling running in AdS5 orbifold [5,6].\nThus, the position dependent momentum cutoff is naturally realized in the deconstruction\nsetup. For the flat extra dimension (\u03b5 = 1), the lowest modes have fewer nodes since they\nhave smaller gradients and give lighter Kaluza-Klein states. However, if the extra dimension\nis highly warped, the scale felt by the mode is different and the lowest excited mode is the\none that has a variation at very near the TeV brane. In our analysis \u03b5 \u226a 1 and, using eqs.\n(8), this corresponds to k \u226b \u039b which means the curvature effect is crucial. If the cutoff is\nmuch lower the curvature scale, then the net degree of freedom encountered as the energy\nincreases is less than in the flat case as the Kaluza-Klein level spacing becomes larger. This\nis the momentum space version of the position dependent momentum cutoff and is also\nrelated to the entropy counting of black holes which is proportional to the area rather than\nthe volume [23].\nFor large N, \u03b5 \u223c 1 even for the Randall-Sundrum geometry and the second lightest mode\nwould have two nodes near the TeV brane, etc. As \u03b5 \u223c 1 corresponds to k \u226a \u039b, the cutoff\nis much above the curvature scale. Then above the curvature scale, we start to see the flat\nfive dimensional physics. Unfortunately this case is beyond the scope of our analysis since\nthe nice separation of scales is not allowed and only numerical works can give results.\n\n3 The\n\nexpression contains a term up to O(\u03b52 ). Here we assume \u03b5 \u226a 1. However, even at O(\u03b52 )\nthere can be order one or bigger than order one corrections due to N which can be extremely\nlarge. N \u03b52 can not be neglected with simple assumption \u03b5 \u226a 1. Therefore, it is assumed also that\nN \u03b52 \u226a 1 such that the potentially dangerous correction can be neglected. In the realistic case\n1\nand N = 16 satisfies\nexplaining the gauge hierarchy, we need \u03b5N = 10\u221216 . The choice of \u03b5 = 10\n2\nthe second assumption N \u03b5 = 0.16 \u226a 1.\n\n8\n\n\fIII. RUNNING OF GAUGE COUPLINGS\n\nThe running behaviour of the gauge couplings in the AdS5 background is an important\nquestion both from the theoretical and the phenomenological point of view. However, different regularizations show different results which do not exactly coincide. In this section\nwe study this problem using the decontruction setup described in the previous section. We\nconcentrate on the case where only the gauge and the link-Higgs fields are replicated (live\nin the 'bulk') and the matter fields live on either the first or the N-th site, corresponding to\nmatter fields on the Planck and the TeV brane, respectively. The matter fields propagating\nin the 'bulk' are investigated in Appendix A.\nWe find it convenient to study the running using the bottom-up approach. We start with\na gauge coupling measured at some low energy scale MZ , \u03b1(MZ ). The running up to the\nscale of the lowest link-Higgs vev v\u01ebN \u22121 proceeds as in an ordinary 4D gauge theory:\n1\n1\nb0\nQ\n=\n\u2212\nlog\n\u03b1(Q)\n\u03b1(MZ ) 2\u03c0\nMZ\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nQ < v\u01ebN \u22121\n\n(12)\n\nand b0 is the beta-function coefficients which gets contributions from the (massless) SU(Nc )\ngauge fields and, eventually, from any matter fields which are effectively massless at the\nconsidered scale.\nAt the scale v\u01ebN \u22121 this coupling is identified with the coupling \u03b1(N ) of the diagonal group.\nIn general, the matching equation at the n-th threshold is:\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n,\n\u03b1(n+1) (v\u03b5n )\n\u03b1(n) (v\u03b5n ) \u03b1n+1 (v\u03b5n )\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b1n is the coupling of the n-th group in the product SU(Nc )N . For \u03b5 \u226a 1, as explained\nin the previous section, the heavy states of gauge bosons can be considered as decoupled\nbetween the thresholds. Also, we assumed that the physical links \u03a3i are decoupled, and Gi\nare Goldstone bosons which become longitudinal components of the heavy gauge bosons.\nThus the running is given by\nb(n+1)\n1\nQ\n=\n\u2212\nlog\nn\n\u03b1(n+1) (Q)\n\u03b1(n+1) (v\u03b5 )\n2\u03c0\nv\u03b5n\n1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nv\u03b5n < Q < v\u03b5n+1\n\n(14)\n\nand the beta-function coefficients b(n+1) include contributions only from the massless SU(Nc )\ngauge fields and from the matter localized from the first up to the n-th site. Since we assumed\nthat all the matter fields live either on the N-th or on the first site we can write bn \u2261 b.\n(but still b 6= b0 if some matter fields live on the N-th site).\nPutting together all these equations, the low-energy gauge coupling \u03b1(MZ ) depends on\nthe high-energy couplings in the following way:\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n+\n+***+\n2\n\u03b1(MZ )\n\u03b11 (v) \u03b12 (v\u03b5) \u03b13 (v\u03b5 )\n\u03b1N (v\u03b5N \u22121)\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\nb\nb0\n1\nv\u03b5N \u22121\n+ log N \u22121 +\nlog\n2\u03c0\n\u03b5\n2\u03c0\nMZ\n\n(15)\n\nAt this point there seem to be two plausible options for choosing the boundary conditions\nfor the gauge couplings of the product group \u03b1n . One is to choose all the gauge couplings to\n9\n\n\fbe equal at the highest scale v. The other is to choose each gauge coupling of the product\ngroup so that they have the same value at different scales, namely at the scale where the\ngiven group gets broken by the link-Higgs vev. The origin of this ambiguity comes from\nthe question, at which scale the matching between 4D and 5D degrees of freedom should be\nperformed. The second option is motivated by AdS/CFT correspondence of the RandallSundrum setup that the cutoff at different positions along the curved extra dimension should\nbe different. In the folowing we investigate the consequences of both approaches.\nThe first option consist in choosing the boundary conditions of the gauge couplings as\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n|v =\n|v = * * *\n|v =\n.\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\u03b1N\n\u03b1\n\n(16)\n\nThe RG running of each gauge coupling down to the scale at which the corresponding group\ngets broken is\nb\u0303\nb\u0303\n1\nv\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\nlog(\n) = + (i \u2212 1) log( ).\n\u03b1i (vi\u22121 )\n\u03b1i (v) 2\u03c0\nvi\u22121\n\u03b1\n2\u03c0\n\u03b5\n\n(17)\n\nHere the beta function coefficient b\u0303 contains, except for the contribution of the massless gauge\nfields, also the contribution from the link-Higgs degrees of freedom G and \u03a3i (depending on\nthe details of the scalar potential). \u00bfFrom the point of view of the 5D RS model this part\nis highly dependent on the UV completion.\nThe low energy gauge coupling is:\nb0\nN\nb\n1\nv\u03b5N \u22121\n1\n+\n=\n+ (N \u2212 1) log\nlog\n\u03b1(MZ )\n\u03b1\n2\u03c0\n\u03b5\n2\u03c0\nMZ\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n!\n\n+\n\n(N \u2212 1)(N \u2212 2) b\u0303\n1\nlog\n2\n2\u03c0\n\u03b5\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n(18)\n\nFor large N the above formula becomes\n1\nN\nN 2 b\u0303\n1\n=\n+\nlog\n\u03b1(MZ )\n\u03b1\n2 2\u03c0\n\u03b5\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n(19)\n\nUsing the dictionary given in eqs. (8) (in particular log(1/\u03b5) \u2192 k/\u039b and N log(1/\u03b5) =\nlog(1/\u03b5N ) \u2192 log(\u039b/\u03bc)) the corresponding equation in the 5D interpretation is\n1\n\u039b b\u0303\n\u03c0R\n\u039b\n+\n\u2243\n(log( ))2 ,\n\u03b1(\u03bc)\n\u03b15\n2k 2\u03c0\n\u03bc\n\n(20)\n\nwhere we relate v \u223c \u039b, vN \u22121 \u223c \u03bc. Therefore, we obtain the result containing log2 ( \u039b\u03bc ) which\nlooks weird. A similar result was obtained by Randall and Schwartz before doing the correct\nGreens function renormalization.\nThe second option looks more plausible. The boundary condition is\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n|v =\n|v1 = * * *\n|vN\u22121 =\n.\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n\u03b1N\n\u03b1\n\n(21)\n\nand the low-energy gauge couplings depends on the high-energy ones as:\n1\nb0\nN\nb\n1\nv\u03b5N \u22121\n+\n=\n+ (N \u2212 1) log\nlog\n\u03b1(MZ )\n\u03b1\n2\u03c0\n\u03b5\n2\u03c0\nMZ\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n10\n\n!\n\n(22)\n\n\fFor large N, the 5D interpretation of this equation is:\n1\n\u03c0R\nb\n\u039b\n=\n+\nlog( ),\n\u03b1(\u03bc)\n\u03b15\n2\u03c0\n\u03bc\n\n(23)\n\nThis just shows the usual logarithmic running for the gauge couplings even though the\ndeconstruction model mimics the gauge bosons propagating in 5D AdS5 orbifold. Another\nfeature which is visible here is that matter localized on the TeV brane does not contribute\nto the running above TeV since its contribution is included in b0 but not in b.\nAnother way to summarize this approach is to notice that in deconstruction it is the\ncoupling \u03b1\u0303 defined as:\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 (i)\n\u2212 . . . \u2212 (i)\n\u2261\n\u2212 (i)\n\u03b1\u0303(Q)\n\u03b1(n) (Q) \u03b11 (v) \u03b12 (v\u03b5)\n\u03b1n (v\u03b5n\u22121 )\n\nv\u03b5n\u22121 < Q < v\u03b5n (24)\n\nwhich is logarithmically sensitive to the difference of the scales:\nb\nQ\n1\n= \u2212 ln\n\u03b1\u0303(Q)\n2\u03c0\nv\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(25)\n\nand thus it should be used to study the physics of RG running in AdS5 .\nThe boundary condition given in eqs. (21) is derived from 5D gauge couplings defined\nat UV scale preserving the symmetry of AdS5 .

The symmetry breaking scale differs for different position of y,\nand the unusual boundary condition is very important in checking whether the unification\nreally occurs. Fig. 3 shows the region that we are considering in the paper.

For flat extra dimensions, the logarithmic running becomes power law as we\nraise up the energy scale since the effective number of Kaluza-Klein modes circulating in\nthe loop increases. More precisely, below 1/R there is only one mode contributing to the\none-loop calculation. At energies above the compactification scale the number of particles\n12\n\n\fcontributing to the running is determined by the number of KK modes with masses below\nthe corresponding energy scale and for n extra dimension it has a simple scaling according\nto energy\nN(E) \u223c E n .\n\n(27)\n\n1\n1\n(E + \u2206E)\n=\n+ bN(E) log\n.\n\u03b1(E + \u2206E)\n\u03b1(E)\nE\n\n(28)\n\nThe differential equation is given by\n\nIntegrating it from 1/R to \u039b one obtains\n1\n1\n=\n+ cn b(\u039bR)n + * * * .\n\u03b1(\u039b)\n\u03b1(1/R)\n\n(29)\n\nFor example, we get a linearly cutoff dependent correction for the gauge theory with one\nextra dimension. But in this case the threshold correction at the cutoff scale is also given\nby c\u039b. Unlike the case of the large logarithmic running in MSSM, the power law running\neffect is always comparable to the threshold correction.\nIn warped gauge theories, the first difference comes from the spectrum. The levels of\nKaluza-Klein modes are not equal spaced and the mass difference between adjacent one\nbecomes bigger for higher KK modes. Therefore the effective number of KK modes below\ncertain energy E is\nN(E) \u223c log E.\n\n(30)\n\nThis softens the power running behavior by a certain amount but can not explain why one\ngets just a logarithmic running like in four-dimensional theory since the integration of the\ndifferential equation gives (log)2 rather than log.\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+ b (log(\u039bR))2 .\n\u03b1(\u039b)\n\u03b1(1/R) 2\n\n(31)\n\nHere comes the second difference. In flat extra dimension, all the couplings of the KK modes\nare the same and are simply related to the higher dimensional coupling. In particular, the\nzero mode gauge coupling is related to the higher dimensional gauge coupling by the volume\nfactor. By looking at the zero mode coupling, we can extract higher dimensional coupling.\nHowever, for the warped extra dimension, the coupling defined at the scale above TeV is not\na zero mode coupling but a coupling localized near the Planck brane. Fig. 2 shows the region\nin which the coupling is defined according to the energy scale above TeV. For extremely high\nenergy scales near the Planck scale, the corresponding coupling is defined only at the Planck\nbrane. The discrepancy between the arguments based on effective KK modes available at\ncertain energy and the result obtained in the deconstruction lies here. Since the coupling\nwe are looking at does not exist in the entire interval, it is very crucial to know what is\nthe wave function overlap of each KK mode with the corresponding region. The interesting\nobservation, which can be made in the deconstruction models, is that, though the effective\nnumber of KK modes is logarithmically increasing at high energies, the net contribution with\n13\n\n\fthe inclusion of the wave function overlap is always that of a single particle contribution.\nThe coupling that we are interested in exists from y = 0 to y\u2217 for given energy E = \u039be\u2212ky\u2217 .\nAs a specific example, let us see the energy range between the first and the second KK mode.\nAt this scale we study the running of the coupling defined from y = 0 to y\u2217 = ( NN\u22121 )\u03c0R and\nonly the zero mode and the first KK mode are light enough to contribute to the running.\nThe zero mode is constant along the extra dimension and contributes ( NN\u22121 ) which is exactly\nproportional to the region on which the gauge coupling is defined. However, the first KK\nmode is localized in the region (y\u2217 , \u03c0R) and its contribution to the coupling in (0, y\u2217) is just\n( N1 ). Therefore, the net contribution is that of single mode. Even at the highest energy\nscale we can reach (\u039b), the net contribution is just that of one particle though all the KK\nmodes are contributing to the running of the Planck brane localized gauge coupling. The\ngauge coupling is defined only near y = 0 and the zero mode has a wave function overlap\n1\n1\n1\nwith the region, the lightest one has (N \u22121)N\n, the second lightest one has (N \u22122)(N\n, etc.,\nN\n\u22121)\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nand the sum is N + (\u2212 N + N \u22121 ) + (\u2212 N \u22121 + N \u22122 ) + * * * + (\u2212 2 + 1) = 1. It is a very interesting\nobservation captured in the deconstruction. The logarithmic running obtained here is in\naccord with the result of Pomarol [4] and Randall-Schwartz [5] for \u039b \u226a k.\nIt should be kept in mind that the Kaluza-Klein mode analysis given here is just a\nconvenient way of deriving RG equation in AdS5 (more generally, in the curved space).\nSince UV parameters are defined at different scales for a 4D observer, it is not trivial to\nrelate the UV parameter and the experimentally measured IR parameter. In solving these\nkinds of problems, the KK analysis via deconstruction is very useful and shows the physics\ntransparently. However, this does not mean that we can derive physical spectrum above\nTeV.\nB. Comment on the continuum limit\n\nSince the low energy gauge coupling is given by that of the diagonal subgroup, it is\nnot possible to raise N to be arbitrary large while keeping the gauge groups above the\ndeconstruction scale weakly coupled. In the case of flat extra dimensions,\nN\n1\n= ,\n\u03b1\n\u03b1i\n\n(32)\n\nand for the low energy coupling \u03b1 \u223c 1/20, we get the maximum number of N to be 240\nwith \u03b1i \u223c 4\u03c0. Similar restriction applies here. If we restrict our analysis to warped gauge\ntheory with known hierarchy, the restriction on N is related to the upper bound on the\ncutoff compared to the curvature scale. With the notation given above,\n\u03b5N \u223c 10\u221216 ,\nk\n\n\u03b5 = e\u2212 \u039b ,\n\n(33)\n\n1\nk\n\u2265 .\n\u039b\n6\n\n(34)\n\nand we get\n\n14\n\n\fThus \u039b = 6k is the maximum cutoff we can reach for the bulk Randall-Sundrum setup 4 .\nThis is enough to study the interesting physics since \u039b is high enough.\nHowever, as we increase N, the neglected corrections become comparable to the log\ncorrection. In the derivation of the running equation for the gauge couplings, it is assumed\nthat \u03b5 \u226a 1 such that log( 1\u03b5 ) \u226b O(1) at each matching scale. Once \u03b5 becomes close to one,\nthe threshold correction can not be neglected. At the same time, the accumulated effect\ngets bigger as N increases. The power law correction N\u03b52 becomes of order one for N \u223c 30\nwith \u03b5 \u223c 1/5. This is when \u039b \u223c 1.6k. For \u03b5 \u223c 1/5, the logarithmic correction is already the\nsame order as order one threshold correction. Therefore, the logarithmic correction derived\nhere is spoiled by the power law correction unless \u03b5 \u226a 1. Furthermore, there is a threshold\ncorrection at the curvature scale which might not be universal when the GUT breaking scale\n(\u039b) is above the curvature scale.\nFor the unified theory living on a (flat) higher dimension, the threshold correction is not\nnegligible and we can not make a clean prediction based on the low energy gauge couplings\n[20]. The same problem appears if we raise our cutoff (the GUT breaking scale) \u039b to be\nhigher than the curvature scale k.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn a gauge theory in the AdS5 background, unlike in the flat case, the gauge coupling\nruns logarithmically. This observation may shed light on the possibility of having a unified\ntheory in the Randall-Sundrum framework. In this paper we studied the running of gauge\ncouplings in four-dimensional deconstruction models which mimic warped gauge theories.\nDeconstruction allows us to understand some properties of higher dimensional gauge theories\nwith the help of the standard tools of four-dimensional gauge theories.\nWhen the scale difference for different link-Higgs fields is large enough, \u03b5 \u226a 1, which\ncorresponds to the cutoff of the 5D theory lower than the curvature scale, the running is\npurely logarithmic. It might be more natural to keep the cut-off above the curvature scale so\nthat one could define the theory at high-energies in an effectively flat background. But once\nwe do this, the cutoff dependent threshold correction and the curvature dependent threshold\ncorrection ruin the predictability for the gauge unification since these unknown corrections\nare comparable to the calculable part. This gives us some insight on the features that a\nhighly predictable GUT theory should possess.\nOnce the GUT breaking scale (MGU T ) is below the curvature scale, then above MGU T\nthree gauge couplings get common corrections, and the different correction start to appear\nbelow MGU T . Then the result obtained in the paper gives a high precision prediction on\nthe possibility of the unification regardless of the physics above MGU T which is common to\nthree gauge couplings.\n\n4 The\n\nbounds on \u039b might be stronger if we consider \u039b > k. In the derivation we used flat space\nconstraint on \u03b1 which is very similar for \u03b5 \u226a 1. However, for \u03b5 \u223c 1, power law correction appears\nand the restricted value of N might be smaller than 240.\n\n15\n\n\fConstructing realistic unification model of the warped gauge theory which can avoid\nproton decay remains as a future work.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nHD thanks K.

APPENDIX A: BULK FIELDS\n\nIn this appendix we investigate the effect of a replicated scalar field on the running of\ngauge couplings in the deconstruction set-up. Following the analysis of Section III we will\nkeep track of the evolution of the coupling \u03b1\u0303(Q) defined in eq. (24).\nA complex 5D bulk field h(x\u03bc , y) in the fundamental representation is accounted for in\ndecostruction by putting at each site a complex field hi (x\u03bc ) in the fundamental representation\nof the i-th group. Moreover, scalars living on neighbouring sites should communicate via the\nlink-Higgs fields. In a non-supersymmetric set-up, the most general set of such couplings is\nvery complicated so in the following we restrict ourselves to just one specific example when\nkinetic and interaction terms are:\nN\nX\n\n\u2202\u03bc h\u2020i \u2202\u03bc hi\n\ni=1\n\n\u2212\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\n|g\u03a6i hi+1 \u2212 mi hi |\n\n2\n\n!\n\n(35)\n\nIn the continuum limit this lagrangian corresponds to:\nL=\u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\ndy \u2202\u03bc h\u2020 \u2202\u03bc h \u2212 a2 (y)|\u22025 h \u2212 M\u01eb(x5 )h|2\n\n\u0011\n\n(36)\n\ni)\nwhere gi vi \u223c a(y\nand mi \u2212 gi vi \u223c a(yi )M(yi ). Thus for a choice vi = v\u03b5i , mi =\ndy\nxgvi our deconstruction lagrangian (35) mimics the 5D bulk scalar in the RS background\n(appropriately rescaled so as to get the kanonical 4D kinetic term) with a constant kink-mass\nterm\n\nM \u223c (x \u2212 1)gv\n\n(37)\n\nNote that both lagrangian of eqs. (36) and (35) yield a massless mode. In the 5D case its\n(0)\nprofile is given by h(0) = exp(M|y|) while in the deconstruction it is hi = xi . Since the\nmatching (37) yields x \u223c 1 + M/(gv) \u223c 1 + M\u2206y we see we can reliably mimic scalar with\na kink-mass not greater than (\u2206y)\u22121 .\nWe are now ready to investigate the effect of such replicated scalar field on the running.\nWe consider seperately three cases:\n1. x = 1 (vanishing bulk mass term)\n1\nis defined as \u03b1(1)1(Q) \u2212 \u03b111(v) thus only h1 (which is effectively massless\nAbove v\u03b5, \u03b1\u0303(Q)\nat this scale) contribute to its running.\n16\n\n\fAt v\u03b5 two groups are effectively broken and both h1 and h2 can contribute to the\n1\n1\nrunning of \u03b1\u0303(Q)\n= \u03b1(2)1(Q) \u2212 \u03b111(v) \u2212 \u03b12 (v\u03b5)\n. The relevant mass terms are:\nL = \u2212(gv\u03b5)2 |h1 \u2212 h2 |2\n\n(38)\n\nDiagonalizing the mass matrix, we find that (for g \u223c 1) one eigenvalue is 2v\u03b5 thus\nthe corresponding state is decoupled below v\u03b5. The other eigenvalue is zero (or more\nprecisely, less than v\u03b52 ), hence we conclude that down to v\u03b52 the bulk scalar gives the\nreplicated of one massless scalar to the running of \u03b1\u0303(Q).\nRepeating this analysis at the consecutive thresholds we always find the same qualitative picture: there is one combination of the scalars hp which is effectively massless and\nthe remaining states are decoupled. Thus, in deconstruction picture, for a replicated\nscalar without bulk mass term only the zero-mode contributes to the running of \u03b1 and\nthe running is given by:\n1\nbS\nQ\n= \u2212 log\n\u03b1\u0303(Q)\n2\u03c0\nv\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(39)\n\nwhere bS is the beta-function coefficient of a massless scalar in the fundamental representation.\n2. x < 1, (negative kink mass)\nIn this case, the zero mode is localized towards the first site and thus it should contribute to the evolution of the coupling from high down to low scales, just like a field\non the Planck brane. In fact, the analysis is very similar to the case x = 1 described\nin the preceding paragraphs. At each threshold there is one massless state which contributes to the running and the remaining states can be considered decoupled. Thus,\nalso for x < 1, the running is given be eq. (39).\n3. x > 1, (positive kink mass)\nIn this case, the zero mode is localized towards the N-th site and thus it is not necessarily seen at high-energies. The analysis is more complicated and, in general, an\nexact formula for the running cannot be found.\nAbove v\u03b5, only h1 can contribute to the running of \u03b1. Its mass is xv\u03b5 thus it decouples\nbefore reaching the v\u03b5 threshold. Thus, the running is given by:\n1\n1\nbS\nx\u03b5v\n=\n\u2212\nlog\n\u03b1(1) (v\u03b5)\n\u03b11 (v) 2\u03c0\nv\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(40)\n\nIn the range (v\u03b5, v\u03b52) h1 and h2 can contribute to the running of \u03b1\u0303(Q) and their mass\nterms are:\nL = \u2212(gv\u03b5)2 |h2 \u2212 xh1 |2 \u2212 (gxv\u03b52 )2 |h2 |2\n\n(41)\n\nThe greater eigenvalue is approximately (x2 + 1)vg\u03b5 and the corresponding \u221a\nstate is\n2\n2\ndecoupled. The lower eigenvalue is approximately (x \u2212 1)gv\u03b5 and for x > 2 this\nstate decoples before reaching v\u03b52 . Thus the running is:\n17\n\n\f1\nbS\n(x2 \u2212 1)\u03b52 v\n1\n=\n\u2212\nlog\n\u03b1(2) (v\u03b52 )\n\u03b1(2) (v\u03b5) 2\u03c0\nv\u03b5\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u0011\nbS \u0010 2\n1\n1\nbS\n=\nx(x \u2212 1)\n+\n\u2212\nlog \u03b52 \u2212\n\u03b11 (v) \u03b12 (v\u03b5) 2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n!\n\n(42)\n\nRepeating the same analysis for consecutive thresholds we obtain:\n1\nbS\nbS\nM\nQ\n\u2212\n= \u2212 log\nlog f ( , Q)\n\u03b1\u0303(Q)\n2\u03c0\nv\n2\u03c0\nv\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(43)\n\nCompared to the two previous cases there appears a correction depending on some\nfunction f of the effective kink mass and the RG scale Q.\nVI. APPENDIX B : THREE-SITE MODEL\n\nIt is meaningful to look at the simplest model showing interesting physics. Since it is not\npossible to analyze N-site model in general exactly without numerical analysis, cascading\nprocedure is used to study warped gauge theory. This requires enough amount of scale\ndifferences for VEVs of different sites and the flat limit can not be taken continuously\nwithin this analysis. For three sites, it is possible to diagonalize 3 \u00d7 3 matrix exactly and\nthis allows us to see both the flat and warped gauge theory limit at the same time by taking\nthe parameters appropriately. Therefore in this appendix we study three site model5 . \u00bfFrom\nthe general expression, we get\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\u22121\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n2\n\uf8ed \u22121 1 + \u03b5 \u2212\u03b52 \uf8f8\n0 \u2212\u03b52 \u03b52\n\n(44)\n\nfor N = 3.

Gauge theory in flat space(\u03b5 = 1)\nThe eigenvalues are 3, 1 and 0 and the corresponding eigenstates are (1, \u22122, 1),\n(1, 0, \u22121) and (1, 1, 1) respectively. This shows the dependence of KK mass on the\nvariation of the coefficients. The heaviest mode has the biggest variation along the\nindex (corresponding the coordinate along the extra dimension in the geometric interpretation).\n2. Slightly warped gauge theory (\u03b52 = 1 \u2212 \u03b4, 0 < \u03b4 \u226a 1)\nThis corresponds to the case in which k \u226a \u039b. The eigenvalues are 3 \u2212 3\u03b42 ,1 \u2212 2\u03b4 and 0\nand the eigenstates are (1 + 3\u03b44 , \u22122, 1 \u2212 3\u03b44 ), (1 \u2212 4\u03b4 , 2\u03b4 , \u22121 \u2212 4\u03b4 ) and (1, 1, 1) respectively.\nThe eigenvalues are slightly smaller than the flat limit and the eigenstates start to\nshow the tendency that the first excited mode has a more or less similar value for A1\nand A2 while A3 becomes bigger. For the heavest mode, A3 part decreases and A1 and\nA2 becomes to be a similar magnitude with opposite sign.\n3. warped gauge theory(\u03b5 \u226a 1)\n2\n2\nThe eigenvalues are 2 + \u03b52 , 3\u03b52 and 0 and the eigenstates are (1, \u22121, 0), (1, 1, \u22122) and\n(1, 1, 1) respectively. The wave function shows the sharp peak at the position whose\nlocal cutoff is similar to the Kaluza-Klein mass. The zero mode has a constant wave\nfunction. The first excited mode has a peak at the third site. The second (highest)\nexcited mode has a peak at the second site.\n\n19\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] N. Arkani-Hamed, S. Dimopoulos and G. R. Dvali, Phys.
