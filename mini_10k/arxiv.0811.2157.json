In a top-bottom approach one starts from some\nstring compactification which is fully consistent globally (e.g. with global RR-tadpole\ncancellation in the Type II case) and after a process of symmetry breaking one obtains a\nlow-energy spectrum close to the SM (or the MSSM). On the other hand, in a bottom-up\napproach [1] one considers local configurations of lower dimensional Dp-branes, p \u2264 7,\nwhich are localized on some region of the compact dimensions and reproduce SM physics.\nIn this second case one does not care about the global aspects of the compactification\nand assumes that eventually the configuration may be embedded inside a fully consistent\nglobal model. This second bottom-up approach is not available in heterotic or Type I\nstring compactifications since the SM fields would then live in the full six extra dimensions.\nIn principle one would say that having a globally consistent compactification would\nbe more satisfactory. However, local configurations of branes may be more efficient in\ntrying to identify promising classes of string vacua, independently of the details of the\nglobal theory. Eventually, if one successful bottom-up configuration is found one can then\nlook for ways to embed it in a globally consistent model. In a stronger version of a local\nconstruction, the local SM or GUT physics is required to decouple from the gravitational\nsector in the infinite volume limit. This is the case of models derived from D3-branes at\nsingularities [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] in which the SM physics only depends on the local geometry\naround the singularity [1]. In this situation one can cleanly disconnect the SM physics\nfrom the gravitational sector in such a way that local model building has an specific sense,\nsince SM physics may indeed be separated from the rest of the compactification.\nAnother realization of the bottom-up philosophy has been recently considered in the\ncontext of local F-theory [6] grand unified models [7, 8, 9]. As particularly emphasized in\n[8, 9], if the F-theory 7-branes containing a GUT group wrap certain classes of complex\ntwo-dimensional surfaces S whose volume is contractible to zero (del Pezzo surfaces), one\ncan take the overall infinite volume limit (Mp \u2192 \u221e) and get again the SM/GUT physics\ndecoupled from the gravitational sector. The main advantage of a F-theory GUT version\nof the bottom-up approach is that gauge coupling unification is naturally guaranteed.\n\n1\n\n\fIn the context of the MSSM the gauge coupling unification prediction [10] is in very\ngood agreement with experiment and it seems sensible trying to incorporate it when\nsearching for a realistic string vacuum. In an independent development it has been shown\n[11] that if MSSM matter is localized on 7-brane intersections and the source of SUSY\nbreaking is modulus mediation, the emerging pattern of SUSY-breaking soft terms at\ntree level is consistent with all current experimental constraints. It was also shown that\nin order to obtain these successful results it was important that in the physical Yukawa\ncouplings driving electroweak symmetry breaking all the fields involved should come from\nintersecting 7-branes. Interestingly enough this is the structure that appears in the Ftheory GUT's constructed in [9] in which indeed non-vanishing Yukawa couplings appear\nonly among fields living at intersecting 7-branes.\nIn the class of local F-theory GUT's constructed in [8, 9] (see also [12, 13, 14, 15, 16,\n17, 18, 19, 20] for more recent work) the MSSM fields reside at certain matter curves corresponding to Riemann surfaces on the complex 2-fold S where the GUT symmetry lives.\nAt those curves the singularity associated to the GUT symmetry (SU(5) or SO(10)) is\nenhanced and at points at which three matter curves intersect there is a further enhancing\nof the singularity. These triple intersections of two quark/lepton matter curves with a\nHiggs curve enable Yukawa couplings to appear. However, there is a feature of the Yukawa\ncouplings which is quite unattractive. For a Yukawa coupling to exist, the two matter\ncurves associated to quarks/leptons must be different. Thus, for example, in an SU(5)\nF-theory GUT of this class a coupling 10i \u00d7 10j \u00d7 5H is only non-vanishing when i 6= j.\nAs emphasized in [9] such kind of U-quark mass matrix is unable to accommodate the\nhierarchical structure observed experimentally. In [9] a solution to this F-theory GUT's\nYukawa problem was proposed in which it is assumed that the 10s (or the 16's in SO(10)\nGUT's) have self-pinching, a self-intersecting geometry in which the corresponding matter\ncurve intersects itself on the surface S.\nIn this paper we point out that the F-theory Yukawa problem is naturally solved by\nslightly generalizing the conditions on the U(1) fluxes breaking the GUT symmetry down\nto the SM. Indeed, in order to avoid that different MSSM particles could have different\nmultiplicities it is assumed in [9] that the U(1) flux through all matter curves \u03a3i containing\n\n2\n\n\fquark and leptons vanish,\nZ\n\nFU (1) = 0 .\n\n(1.1)\n\n\u03a3i\n\nOur main point is that this condition is too strong. It is enough to ask that if we have\ntwo matter curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 corresponding to the same GUT representation, in order to\nkeep equal the number of generations for all quarks and leptons it is enough to request\nthat this is true on average, i.e.\nZ\n\n\u03a31\n\nFU (1) +\n\nZ\n\nFU (1) = 0 .\n\n(1.2)\n\n\u03a32\n\nIf this is the case, one finds that the left-handed and right-handed quarks and leptons\nare redistributed unequally among the two matter curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 in such a way that\nall quarks and leptons are allowed to get non-vanishing Yukawa couplings in a way which\nallows for a hierarchical structure. Moreover, as a direct byproduct it follows that the\nmixing of the third generation quarks with the first two generations is suppressed. On the\ncontrary, mixing among leptons is unconstrained. These two facts are in good qualitative\nagreement with experiment. We find this fact quite encouraging since we were only\nlooking for a way to get Yukawa couplings for all quarks and leptons and not looking for\nany particular texture. This works both for SO(10) and SU(5) F-theory GUT's, although\nfor SO(10) this reshuffling of quarks and leptons is particularly simple and symmetric.\nIn the SO(10) case it is the flux of the U(1)B\u2212L in the bulk which breaks the symmetry\ndown to the left-right symmetric model and hence a further step of symmetry breaking\ndown to the SM is needed. In the case of SU(5) it is the hypercharge flux which breaks\nthe bulk symmetry down to the SM. However the matter curves will feel U(1)B\u2212L flux\nwhich again reshuffles the fermion spectrum in the matter curves associated to 10s and\n5s. Although the number of quark/lepton generations is not fixed in these local F-theory\nconstructions, it is intriguing that three generations is somewhat special. Indeed one can\nsee that three is the minimum number of generations consistent with having a purely\nchiral quark/lepton spectrum (i.e. without vector-like fermion copies).\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. After reviewing the F-theory GUT constructions of [8, 9], we discuss in section 3 the F-theory GUT Yukawa problem and its solution\nin terms of the reshuffling of fermions induced by U(1) fluxes in general terms. In section\n4 we construct an specific local F-theory SO(10) GUT with the symmetry broken by\n3\n\n\fU(1)B\u2212L flux. A brief discussion of some phenomenological aspects is given. An SU(5)\nlocal GUT is presented in section 5. Some final comments are left for section 6. A brief\ncompendium on del Pezzo surfaces and other mathematical results are collected in an\nappendix.\n\n2\n\nF-theory Grand Unification\n\nIn this section we briefly review the basic formalism. We mostly follow [8, 9] where the\nreader can find a more complete discussion (see also [7, 19]). Some details about del Pezzo\nsurfaces and other useful results are summarized in the appendix.\nIn F-theory GUT's the gauge theory arises from 7-branes wrapping a compact surface\nS of complex codimension one in the base of an elliptically-fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold.\nThe gauge group GS depends on the singularity type of the elliptic fiber. This gauge group\ncan be broken by a background in a subgroup HS \u2282 GS . We will consider HS = U(1).\nN =1 supersymmetry requires this U(1) line bundle L to satisfy certain conditions stated\nin [8].\nWe will take S to be a del Pezzo surface. As stressed in [8, 9], in this case the\nresulting gauge theory on the 7-branes decouples from gravity in the bulk. In consequence\nthe resulting GUT is more constrained. In particular, the allowed supersymmetric line\nbundles are completely characterized as reviewed in the appendix. In this framework it\nis possible to extract definite physical features of F-theory GUT's.\nThe U(1) background breaks the gauge group GS to the commutant \u0393S \u00d7 U(1). The\nadjoint representation of GS decomposes into a direct sum of irreducible representations\nof \u0393S \u00d7 U(1), each generically labelled as (r, q). When S is a del Pezzo surface, the\nnumber of multiplets from the adjoint with U(1) charge q, and transforming under r of\n\u0393S , is given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nN(r, q) = h1 (S, Lq ) = \u2212 1 + c1 (Lq ) * c1 (Lq ) ,\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere h1 (S, Lq ) is the dimension of the corresponding cohomology group and c1 (Lq ) is\nthe first Chern class of the bundle Lq . Here we have already used that the admissible line\nbundles on a del Pezzo surface must satisfy c1 (S)*c1(L) = 0. Observe that the multiplicity\ndoes not depend on the sign of q. Thus, N(r, q) = N(r\u0304, \u2212q), and only vector-like matter\n4\n\n\fwill result.\nCharged multiplets with definite chirality will never originate from the adjoint in the\nbreaking of GS when S is a del Pezzo surface. Fortunately, in general there is another way\nto obtain charged matter in F-theory GUTs. Charged multiplets also arise by introducing\nnon-compact surfaces Si\u2032 asociated to extra 7-branes, each intersecting S at a Riemann\nsurface \u03a3i where the fields are localized. At each matter curve \u03a3i the singularity type\nis enhanced to group G\u03a3i of rank at least one higher. The gauge group GS is further\nenhanced to Gp of rank at least two higher at points in S where three matter curves\nintersect. For instance, when Gp has rank two higher in practice Gp \u2283 GS \u00d7U(1)a \u00d7U(1)b ,\nand from the decomposition of the adjoint of Gp one can identify the intersecting matter\ncurves. The multiplets that materialize at each intersection descend from the adjoint of\nG\u03a3i and their degeneracy can be computed as reviewed shortly.\nTo be more concrete, we consider an example with GS = SO(10) and Gp = E7 . We\nneed the decomposition of the adjoint 133 given by\nE7 \u2283 SO(10) \u00d7 U(1)a \u00d7 U(1)b\n\n(2.2)\n\n133 = Adjoints + [(10, 2, 0) + (16, \u22121, 1) + (16, \u22121, \u22121) + (1, 0, 2) + c.c.] .\nThe last entries are the U(1) charges. The U(1) generators will be denoted Qa and Qb .\nThe main point is that for each distinct charged representation that shows up in the\nadjoint branching there is a matter curve. In this example there are two distinct 16's\nand a Higgs 10. Thus, there will be quark-lepton curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 associated each to a\n16i , and a Higgs curve \u03a3H that hosts the 10H . Since the curves are required to intersect,\nthere will be a coupling 161 \u00d7 162 \u00d7 10H , which is indeed allowed by gauge invariance.\nOn each matter curve GS is enhanced to a group of rank at least one higher. In\nthe GS = SO(10) and Gp = E7 example, the singularity is enhanced to G\u03a3i = E6 on \u03a3i ,\ni = 1, 2. Decomposing the adjoint of E6 under SO(10)\u00d7U(1)\u2032i includes a 16i . To determine\nthe U(1)\u2032i generators, notice that (2.2) shows that along the directions (Qa \u2212 Qb ) = 0 and\n(Qa + Qb ) = 0 there appear 32 additional neutral states and SO(10) is indeed enhanced\nto E6 . Choosing a convenient normalization we then have\n1\nQ\u20321 = \u2212 (Qa \u2212 Qb ) ;\n2\n5\n\n1\nQ\u20322 = \u2212 (Qa + Qb ) .\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fIn this way there will be a 161 with charge q1\u2032 = 1, and a 162 with q2\u2032 = 1. Concerning\nthe Higgs curve, the singularity must be enhanced to G\u03a3H = SO(12). Decomposing the\nadjoint of SO(12) under SO(10) \u00d7 U(1)\u2032H yields the desired 10H . From (2.2) we see that\n\u2032\nSO(10) \u2192 SO(12) along Qa = 0. We choose Q\u2032H = Qa /2 and qH\n= 1.\n\nFollowing [8, 9] we now discuss how to compute the degeneracy of the multiplets living\non a matter curve \u03a3 at the intersection of S and some S \u2032 . On \u03a3 the GUT group GS is\nenhanced to G\u03a3 \u2283 GS \u00d7 GS \u2032 . We consider GS \u2032 = U(1)\u2032 . In turn GS is broken to \u0393S \u00d7 U(1)\nby a background in HS = U(1). Similarly, GS \u2032 is broken by a background HS \u2032 that is\ntaken to be U(1)\u2032 . The two line bundles are denoted L and L\u2032 respectively. The adjoint of\nG\u03a3 decomposes under \u0393S \u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 U(1)\u2032 into a direct sum of irreducible representations\nthat can be labelled (r, q, q \u2032). The degeneracy of a multiplet transforming into such a\nrepresentation is given by\n1/2\n\n\u2032\n\nN(r, q, q \u2032 ) = h0 (\u03a3, K\u03a3 \u2297 Lq\u03a3 \u2297 L\u2032q\n\u03a3 ) ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere L\u03a3 \u2261 L|\u03a3 and L\u2032\u03a3 \u2261 L\u2032 |\u03a3 are the restrictions of the line bundles L and L\u2032 to \u03a3.\nHere K\u03a3 is the canonical line bundle of \u03a3. We will mostly consider the cases where \u03a3 has\n1/2\n\ngenus zero and K\u03a3 = O\u03a3 (\u22121), or \u03a3 has genus one and K\u03a3 is trivial. For the complex\nconjugate it follows that\n1/2\n\n\u2032\n\nN(r, \u2212q, \u2212q \u2032 ) = h1 (\u03a3, K\u03a3 \u2297 Lq\u03a3 \u2297 L\u2032q\n\u03a3 ) .\n\n(2.5)\n\nFurthermore, taking into account that L and L\u2032 are line bundles, the net multiplicity\nturns out to be\n1/2\n\n\u2032\n\nN(r, q, q \u2032) \u2212 N(r, \u2212q, \u2212q \u2032 ) = (1 \u2212 g) + c1 (K\u03a3 \u2297 Lq\u03a3 \u2297 L\u2032q\n\u03a3 ) ,\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere g is the genus of \u03a3. Finally, we remark that the U(1)\u2032 decouples because the noncompact surface S \u2032 has formally infinite volume. Then, after computing the degeneracies\nwe can drop the label q \u2032 .\nIn the finite volume case the extra U(1) symmetries are anomalous and their gauge\nbosons get generically massive by combining with RR-fields of the full compactification.\nNote that, as pointed out in [21, 1], anomaly free U(1)'s like hypercharge or U(1)B\u2212L\nmay also become massive by combining with RR fields. There are conditions under which\n6\n\n\fthis may be avoided [21, 1] (see also [22]) and in the F-theory GUT's this can also be\nimplemented [9]. This is not the case in heterotic compactifications in which setting flux\nalong some U(1) direction necessarily gives mass to the corresponding gauge boson [9]\n(see also [12]).\nIn the appendix we will further discuss the quantities involved in computing the multiplicities and will collect some useful results to this purpose.\n\n3\n\nU (1) Fluxes and fermion splitting\n\nAs mentioned before, there is a generic problem for F-theory GUT's from the Yukawa\ncoupling structure. Indeed, in these models Yukawa couplings come from the intersection\nof three curves inside the surface S. These curves generically correspond to different\nmatter fields and the coupling constants have the structure [9]\nYij =\n\nX\n\n\u03a8R (p)i \u03a8L (p)j \u03a8H (p)\n\n(3.1)\n\np\n\nwhere \u03a8R,L,H (p) are the internal wave functions of the left-handed, right-handed and Higgs\nmatter fields evaluated at the intersection points p, which may be generically multiple.\nIn SO(10) GUT's the Yukawa couplings are of the form 16i \u00d7 16j \u00d7 10H and the fact\nthat the curves involved must be different means that for i = j those Yukawa couplings\nvanish, i.e. the structure of Yukawa couplings\n\uf8eb\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nYq,l \u2243 \uf8ec x\n\uf8ed\nx\n\nis of the form\n\uf8f6\nx x\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 x \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\nx 0\n\n(3.2)\n\nwith x representing generically non-vanishing entries. This is illustrated in figure 1 for\na particular SO(10) example with two matter curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 having two and one\ngenerations respectively. From (3.2) one can then easily see that there is no regime in\nwhich one of the eigenvalues of the matrix is large with the other two small, as required to\nexplain the data. Rather if one of the eigenvalues is small, the heavier ones are necessarily\nof the same order of magnitude. Something analogous happens in SU(5) for the U-quark\nmasses which come from couplings with the structure 10i \u00d7 10j \u00d7 5H . Here again it is\nnot possible to obtain one large eigenvalue (top quark) with the other two much smaller.\n7\n\n\f\u03a31\n\n\u03a32\n\nL2,3\n\nR\n2,3\n\n1\n\n1\n\nR\n\nL\n\n1\n\nQ2,3\nL\n\nQ\n\nR\n1\n\nQL\n\nQ\n\n2,3\nR\n\nSO(10)\n\n\u03a3H\n\nFigure 1: Triple intersection of two curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 , with two and one generations of SO(10)\nwithout fluxes going through them. Dashed lines represent fermions linked by a Yukawa coupling.\nMost Yukawa couplings are forbidden.\n\nA possible solution to this problem advocated in [8, 9] consists of assuming that the\nmatter curves where the fermions in problematic representations reside (16s in SO(10),\n10s in SU(5)) have a self-intersecting geometry, the corresponding curve intersects itself\ninside S. This in general provides for non-vanishing diagonal entries in eq.(3.2) which\ncould then be compatible with a hierarchical structure. Although this could certainly be\na solution to the F-theory GUT Yukawa problem, we would like to argue in the present\narticle that there is quite a natural and economical solution which does not require the\nassumption of any intricate geometry for the matter curves but rather relies on the gauge\nstructure of the GUT.\nGiven that Yukawa terms couple right-handed and left-handed fermions to a Higgs\nfield, the idea of the natural solution is to have a matter curve \u03a3R with all right-handed\nfermions, another one \u03a3L with all left-handed fermions and both intersecting a Higgs\nmatter curve \u03a3H . In this way all Yukawa couplings would be in principle allowed, there\nwould be no self-intersections required. This would be for example the case in perturbative\nType IIB orientifolds with e.g. a SU(4) \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R structure in which left- and\n\n8\n\n\fright-handed quarks may be localized at different D7-brane intersections and transform\nas (4, 2L , 1) and (4, 1, 2R ) respectively. However our philosophy is to build GUT models\nwhich incorporate gauge coupling unification in a natural way. Unfortunately in GUT's\nlike SO(10) or SU(5) this structure is not available since left- and right-handed fermions\nsit in the same GUT representations. However, there is a logical way out in F-theory\nGUTs. Imagine we start with two matter curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 , each containing matter in\nthe same GUT representation R, e.g. 16 in SO(10), or 10 in SU(5). The same U(1) flux\nwhich breaks the GUT symmetry down to the SM (or some extension) could perhaps be\nallowed to go through both matter curves and split the fields so that one curve contains\nright-handed fields and the other left-handed fields. Then again all Yukawa couplings\nwould be allowed. Indeed we will see that U(1)B\u2212L fluxes in SO(10) or hypercharge flux\nin SU(5) can under certain conditions reshuffle the matter content in curves \u03a31 and \u03a32\nin such a way that Yukawa couplings for all quarks and leptons may appear. In fact\nthere will not be purely right-handed \u03a3R or left-handed \u03a3L curves but the net effect will\nbe quite analogous to that structure with an appropriate flipping of left by right in the\ncurves.\nIn the models constructed in [8, 9] the net flux through each matter curve containing\nquarks and leptons is assumed to be zero. Indeed, threading flux through the quarklepton curves seems risky. Take for example the SU(5) case. If hypercharge flux is added,\nsince the SM fields have different hypercharges, one would expect different multiplicity\nfor each SM field, nothing we would like to have. However this is not true in general. As\nwe will see, if we have two matter curves, \u03a31 and \u03a32 , giving rise to the same GUT group\nrepresentation, there are simple conditions under which a U(1) flux may be allowed to go\nthrough the two curves in such a way that the net multiplicity for each multiplet is equal,\ndespite all of them having different charges.\nLet us be more specific. Consider two matter curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 which we will take\nfor definiteness to have genus g = 0. Each curve contains matter transforming in the\nsame GUT representation R1 = R2 . We are adding fluxes through both curves along\na U(1) \u2282 GS , with GS the GUT group living on the surface S. In addition these representations have charges q1\u2032 and q2\u2032 under groups U(1)\u20321 and U(1)\u20322 corresponding to the\nintersecting surfaces S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 . Once the U(1) flux is added the GUT symmetry is broken\n9\n\n\fto \u0393S \u00d7 U(1) and the two multiplets further decompose as\nR1 =\n\nM\n(r\u03b1 , q\u03b1 , q1\u2032 ) ;\n\nR2 =\n\n\u03b1\n\nM\n\n(r\u03b1 , q\u03b1 , q2\u2032 ) ,\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere the r\u03b1 are irreducible representations of \u0393S .\nWe now assume that the restrictions of the U(1) bundle L to the two curves have the\nforms L\u03a31 = O\u03a31 (1)1/n and L\u03a32 = O\u03a32 (\u22121)1/n respectively. We have allowed for possible\nfractional bundles, i.e. n= 5 for SU(5), and n = 4, 2 for SO(10) [9]. The main point here\nis that L\u03a31 and L\u03a32 have opposite instanton numbers. Instead of insisting that the fluxes\nthrough each individual curve vanish, we rather impose that the flux vanishes on average,\nnamely\nZ\n\nFU (1) +\n\n\u03a31\n\nZ\n\nFU (1) = 0 .\n\n(3.4)\n\n\u03a32\n\nThere will also be the restrictions of the gauge bundles on S1\u2032 and S2\u2032 which we take to be\nof the general form L\u2032\u03a31 = O\u03a31 (n1 )1/n and L\u2032\u03a32 = O\u03a32 (n2 )1/n with n1 and n2 appropriately\nchosen integers. Under these conditions the multiplicity of each representation (r\u03b1 , q\u03b1 )\ndue to each curve will be (we are assuming g = 0 for both curves)\n1\n1\n[q\u03b1 + n1 q1\u2032 ]) = (q\u03b1 + n1 q1\u2032 )\nn\nn\n1\n1\n: N2 (r\u03b1 , q\u03b1 ) = h0 (\u03a32 , O\u03a32 (\u22121 + [\u2212q\u03b1 + n2 q2\u2032 ]) = (\u2212q\u03b1 + n2 q2\u2032 )\nn\nn\n\n\u03a31 : N1 (r\u03b1 , q\u03b1 ) = h0 (\u03a31 , O\u03a31 (\u22121 +\n\u03a32\n\n(3.5)\n\nso that the net multiplicity of each representation (r\u03b1 , q\u03b1 ) is given by\nN(r\u03b1 , q\u03b1 ) =\n\n1\n(n1 q1\u2032 + n2 q2\u2032 )\nn\n\n(3.6)\n\nNote that this multiplicity is independent of the value of the charge q\u03b1 of each of the multiplets r\u03b1 inside the GUT representation R. Thus, the same multiplicity for all different\ncomponents can result irrespective of their charges. Note also that if |n1 q1\u2032 | or |n2 q2\u2032 | are\nsmaller than some |q\u03b1 | the spectrum will then include additional vector-like multiplets of\ncharge q\u03b1 . The crucial conclusion is that even though the net number of each (r\u03b1 , q\u03b1 )\nrepresentation is the same, they will be distributed unequally between the two matter\ncurves \u03a31 and \u03a32 .\nNote that this may also be understood as a single reducible matter curve such that\nthe net flux through it is zero. Furthermore it may trivially extended to the case of more\nthan two matter curves in which the net flux vanishes.\n10\n\n\fIn the following we apply this simple idea to specific GUT models with two matter\ncurves \u03a31 and \u03a32 and see how the Yukawa problem is then generically solved.\n\n4\n\nL fluxed SO(10) model\nA B \u2212L\n\nLet us first consider the case of an SO(10) GUT which is broken by U(1)B\u2212L flux down\nto a left-right symmetric extension of the SM. A possible choice of curves and bundles is\nshown in table 1 (see the appendix for notation).

Adding U(1)B\u2212L flux breaks the symmetry and\nthe adjoint decomposes as\nSO(10) \u2283 SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L\n45 =\n\n(4.1)\n\nAdjoints + (3, 1, 1, \u22124) + (3, 1, 1, 4) + (3, 2, 2, 2) + (3, 2, 2, \u22122)\n\nwhere the last entry is the B\u2212L charge. Upon symmetry breaking the SO(10) adjoint\ngives rise to fields transforming under the unbroken gauge group according to this decomposition.\nIn general in the presence of flux there may be massless exotics from the adjoint\ntransforming as (3, 2, 2, 2), (3, 1, 1, 4) and/or their conjugates. As discussed in [9], in the\ncase of SU(5), exotics disappear if some appropriate powers of the U(1) bundle correspond\nto a dPN divisor associated to E8 roots. In SO(10) models one cannot get rid of all exotics\n11\n\n\f[9], but one can still remove most of them. To this end we make the choice\nL = OS (E1 \u2212 E2 )1/2 ,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere the Ei are exceptional divisors. We can now compute the multiplicity of the states\ndescending from the adjoint using (2.1). We obtain\nN(3, 2, 2, 2) = h1 (S, L2 ) = 0 ;\n\nN(3, 2, 2, \u22122) = h1 (S, L\u22122 ) = 0\n\n(4.3)\n\nbecause c1 (L2 ) * c1(L2 ) = \u22122, reflecting that L2 indeed corresponds to an E8 root. On the\nother hand,\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1\nN(3, 1, 1, \u22124) = h1 (S, L\u22124 ) = \u2212 1 + c1 (L\u22124 )2 = 3\n2\n\n(4.4)\n\nand the same result for N(3, 1, 1, 4) = h1 (S, L4 ). So we will have three sets of vector-like\nchiral multiplets\n3[(3, 1, 1, \u22124) + (3, 1, 1, 4)]\n\n(4.5)\n\nIn fact, after further symmetry breaking down to the SM these fields have the quantum\nnumbers of vector-like right-handed D-quarks. We will argue later that these states are\nexpected to become massive after the symmetry breaking process from SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7\nSU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L down to the SM.\nWe have an SO(10) gauge group in our S surface. At some complex curves \u03a3i the\nrank of the singularity is enhanced so that matter transforming as both 16 and 10 does\nappear. In particular, 16s arise from curves in which the singularity is enhanced to E6\nwhereas 10s appear at curves where the symmetry is enhanced to SO(12). These curves\nwill intersect at points of double enhancing up to E7 . Recalling the decomposition of the\nadjoint of E7 under SO(10) \u00d7 U(1)a \u00d7 U(1)b displayed in (2.2) we see that the coupling\n(16, \u22121, 1) \u00d7 (16, \u22121, \u22121) \u00d7 (10, 2, 0) is allowed so that in principle one can engineer three\ncurves \u03a3i , i = 1, 2, and \u03a3H , associated to each representation and giving rise to Yukawa\ncouplings. In particular, we have two types of matter curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 supporting 16s\nthat we can use for the fermion reshuffling mechanism described in the previous section.\nWe have chosen the matter and Higgs curves as indicated in table 1. They verify the\ncondition that \u03a31 and \u03a32 have non-trivial (and positive) intersection among themselves as\nwell as with the Higgs curve \u03a3H , so that Yukawa couplings are possible.

Since (E1 \u2212 E2 ) * \u03a31 = 1 and (E1 \u2212 E2 ) * \u03a32 = \u22121\nwe find that\nL\u03a31 = O\u03a31 (1)1/2 ,\nL\u03a32 = O\u03a32 (\u22121)1/2 ,\nas required in order to have\n\nR\n\n\u03a31\n\nFU (1)B\u2212L +\n\nR\n\n\u03a32\n\n(4.6)\n\nFU (1)B\u2212L = 0.\n\nThe curve \u03a3H supporting the Higgses that couple to matter fermions is selected to\nhave genus one. Doublet-triplet splitting can be realized in this setting as we now explain.\nSince the Higgs curve is such that \u03a3H * (E1 \u2212 E2 ) = 0, the restriction of the U(1)B\u2212L line\nbundle L to \u03a3H has degree zero. We can then choose\nL\u03a3H = O\u03a3H (p1 \u2212 p2 )1/2 ,\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere p1 and p2 are two independent degree one divisors on \u03a3H (see the appendix). We\nalso know that under SO(10) \u2283 SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L the 10 has a\nbranching\n10 = (1, 2, 2, 0) + (3, 1, 1, 2) + (3, 1, 1, \u22122)\n13\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fso that the B\u2212L flux will not affect the doublets that are neutral. To compute the\nmultiplicities according to (2.4) we still need to specify the bundle L\u2032 . A simple option is\nto choose a trivial line bundle. In this way we obtain\nN(1, 2, 2, 0) = h0 (\u03a3H , O\u03a3H ) = 1 ,\n\n(4.9)\n\nbecause on a curve of genus one the only holomorphic sections of the trivial bundle are\nthe constant functions. The upshot is that there is a massless Higgs doublet. Recalling\nthat \u03a3H has trivial canonical line bundle, for the triplet we instead find\nN(3, 1, 1, 2) = h0 (\u03a3H , O\u03a3H (p1 \u2212 p2 )) = 0 ,\n\n(4.10)\n\nbecause the divisor (p1 \u2212 p2 ) is not effective. Using this result together with the index\ntheorem (2.6), and the fact that c1 (O\u03a3H (p1 \u2212 p2 )) = 0, it also follows that\nN(3, 1, 1, \u22122) = h0 (\u03a3H , O\u03a3H (p1 \u2212 p2 )\u22121 ) = 0 .\n\n(4.11)\n\nWe thus obtain a minimal set of massless Higgs doublets.\nWe now consider the effect of the U(1)B\u2212L flux on the 16s living on the two matter\ncurves \u03a31 and \u03a32 . To begin, we recall the well known branching of the 16 under SO(10) \u2283\nSU(3) \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L\n16 = (1, 2, 1, 3) + (3, 1, 2, 1) + (3, 2, 1, \u22121) + (1, 1, 2, \u22123) .\n\n(4.12)\n\nSubstituting the bundle data of table 1 in (2.4) one finds for the matter fields from curve\n\u03a31 (with q \u2032 = 1) the multiplicities\n3 3\n+ ))\n2 2\n1 3\nN(QL ) = N(3, 1, 2, 1) = h0 (\u03a31 , O\u03a31 (\u22121 + + ))\n2 2\n1 3\n0\nN(QR ) = N(3, 2, 1, \u22121) = h (\u03a31 , O\u03a31 (\u22121 \u2212 + ))\n2 2\n3 3\n0\nN(LL ) = N(1, 1, 2, \u22123) = h (\u03a31 , O\u03a31 (\u22121 \u2212 + ))\n2 2\nN(LR ) = N(1, 2, 1, 3) = h0 (\u03a31 , O\u03a31 (\u22121 +\n\n14\n\n= 3,\n= 2,\n= 1,\n= 0.\n\n(4.13)\n\n\fFor the second curve \u03a32 one instead obtains\n3 3\n+ ))\n2 2\n1 3\nN(QL ) = N(3, 1, 2, 1) = h0 (\u03a32 , O\u03a32 (\u22121 \u2212 + ))\n2 2\n1 3\n0\nN(QR ) = N(3, 2, 1, \u22121) = h (\u03a32 , O\u03a32 (\u22121 + + ))\n2 2\n3 3\n0\nN(LL ) = N(1, 1, 2, \u22123) = h (\u03a32 , O\u03a32 (\u22121 + + ))\n2 2\nN(LR ) = N(1, 2, 1, 3) = h0 (\u03a32 , O\u03a32 (\u22121 \u2212\n\n= 0,\n= 1,\n\n(4.14)\n\n= 2,\n= 3.\n\nTherefore, the matter content from each curve is\n\u03a31 : 3 \u00d7 LR + 2 \u00d7 QL + 1 \u00d7 QR ,\n\u03a32 : 3 \u00d7 LL + 2 \u00d7 QR + 1 \u00d7 QL .\n\n(4.15)\n\nNote that altogether there are three net generations but the fields have been redistributed\nand there are no complete 16s in any of the two curves.\nThe remarkable result is that now the rule that states that only fields coming from\ndifferent curves (i.e. \u03a31 \u00d7 \u03a32 \u00d7 \u03a3H ) can have trilinear couplings leads to interesting\ntextures. Indeed note that with the matter content summarized in (4.15) the rule implies\nthe Yukawa structure:\n\nhQ\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f6\n\nx x x\nx x 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u223c \uf8ec x x 0 \uf8f7 ; hL \u223c \uf8ec x x x \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\nx x x\n0 0 x\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere x means something non-vanishing. We see that all fermions may now get a mass\nwithout any self-interaction for the curves. This is important in itself but as a byproduct\nwe obtain three qualitative predictions:\n\u2022 The third generation quarks mix little with the first two generations.\n\u2022 First and second generations may have substantial (Cabbibo) mixing.\n\u2022 The mixing of leptons may generically be large.\nThese three points are in good qualitative agreement with experiment. (Actually, before\nthe breaking of the left-right symmetry there is no mixing, since the U-and D-quark mass\n15\n\n\fmatrices are always proportional. The above statements apply once the L-R symmetry\nhas been broken and this proportionality ceases to be exact, see comments at the end of\nthe section). Additional fermion hierarchies may result once one computes the Yukawa\ncouplings in terms of the values of internal wave functions at the intersection points\nas in eq.(3.1). For example, the 3rd generation quarks will have larger Yukawas if the\n3\nwave functions of Q3L , UR3 , and DR\nevaluated at some intersection point p are larger than\n\nthose of the corresponding quarks of the first two generations. In particular, if the wave\nfunctions at this point satisfy \u03a8\u03c4L (p)\u03a8\u03c4R (p) \u2243 \u03a8bL (p)\u03a8bR (p) \u2243 \u03a8tL (p)\u03a8tR (p), one would\nobtain relationships among the 3rd generation Yukawas of the form h\u03c4 \u2243 hb \u2243 ht .\nThe gauge symmetry SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L has to be further broken\ndown to the SM group. To this purpose we need to have vector-like right-handed doublets\nin our massless spectrum. To obtain these fields we introduce a curve \u03a3\u03c6 giving rise to\nmultiplets (16 + 16) before flux is added. Then the flux must split them so that only a\nvector-like pair of right-handed doublets [(1, 2, 1, 3) + c.c.] remains. This can be achieved\nby considering a genus one curve where the restricted U(1)B\u2212L bundle has degree zero\nagain. Some B\u2212L flux must pierce the curve in order to split the representations and\nremove all fields except the right-handed doublets. A possible curve can have a class\n\u03a3\u03c6 = 3H \u2212 E1 \u2212 E2\n\n(4.17)\n\nwhich has g = 1 and \u03a3\u03c6 * (E1 \u2212 E2 ) = 0. The restriction of the B\u2212L flux onto \u03a3\u03c6 can\nthen again be taken of the form\nL\u03a3\u03c6 = O\u03a3\u03c6 (p3 \u2212 p4 )1/2 ,\n\n(4.18)\n\nwith p3 and p4 degree one divisors in \u03a3\u03c6 . We now choose a non trivial restriction of the\nU(1)\u2032 bundle given by\nL\u2032\u03a3\u03c6 = O\u03a3\u03c6 (p3 \u2212 p4 )\u22123/2 .\n\n(4.19)\n\nTo compute the multiplicities we need the decomposition of the 16 shown in (4.12).\nInserting into (2.4) we find\nN(1, 2, 1, 3) = h0 (\u03a3\u03c6 , O\u03a3\u03c6 ) = 1 .\n\n16\n\n(4.20)\n\n\fThe rest of the multiplets have zero multiplicity since the (p3 \u2212 p4 ) divisor is not effective\nand has degree zero. Thus, the only remaining fields are right-handed doublets transforming as [(1, 2, 1, 3) + (1, 2, 1, \u22123)] whose vev would break the symmetry down to the\nSM.\nThe final spectrum is that of the MSSM. However there are still the three copies\nof exotics [(3, 1, 1, \u22124)exot + c.c] coming from the adjoint of SO(10). In fact, after the\nsymmetry is broken down to the SM those multiplets generically get massive. Indeed,\nnote that in general there ia a coupling 45 \u00d7 16\u03c6 \u00d7 16\u03c6 that gives rise to\n(3, 1, 1, \u22124)exot \u00d7 (1, 2, 1, 3) \u00d7 (3, 2, 1, 1)\n\n(4.21)\n\nThe triplets (3, 2, 1, 1) inside \u03a3\u03c6 are massive KK states and may be exchanged so that\nan effective operator of the form\n(1, 2, 1, 3) \u00d7 (1, 2, 1, \u22123) \u00d7 (3, 1, 1, \u22124)exot \u00d7 (3, 1, 1, 4)exot\n\n(4.22)\n\nis generated. When the right-handed doublets get a vev the three pairs of triplets from\nthe adjoint will dissappear from the massless spectrum.\nIt is not the purpose of this paper to give a full phenomenological study of the models\npresented. Several comments are however in order:\n\u2022 Dirac neutrino masses appear generically with the same size as the rest of quarks and\nleptons from the couplings 161 \u00d7 162 \u00d7 10H . On the other hand, one possible way\nto implement the see-saw mechanism is the following. Large masses for the righthanded neutrinos (which live in the \u03a31 curve) may appear if there are couplings of\nthe form 161 \u00d7 16\u03c6 \u00d7 Ni , with Ni three SM singlets (see figure 2). Once the righthanded doublets inside 16\u03c6 get a vev, the three right-handed neutrinos become\nmassive and the standard sea-saw mechanism will be at work. In this connection\nnote that \u03a3\u03c6 has positive intersection with \u03a31 so that the required coupling is in\nprinciple allowed.\n\u2022 In this model R-parity is automatic due to the SO(10) structure which forbids 163\ncouplings. Hence there are no dim=4 baryon or lepton number violating couplings.\nOn the other hand baryon number violating dim=5 operators (like e.g. QQQL)\n17\n\n\fare suppressed. Such operators appear from couplings of quarks and leptons to\nthe massive color triplets inside the 10. However, due to the split structure of the\nmultiplets in the 16s one can check that the baryon number dim=5 operators always\ninvolve at least one third-generation quark. Thus, the amplitude has additional\nCabbibo suppression which makes the exchange of colored Higgsses harmless.\n\u2022 The quark mass structure in (4.16) before the breaking of the SU(2)R \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7\nU(1)B\u2212L symmetry gives mass matrices for U- and D-quarks which are proportional\nso that at this level there is in fact no mixing. However, once further symmetry\nbreaking takes place the insertion of vevs for the right-handed doublets in \u03a3\u03c6 gives\nrise to mixings between the right-handed D-quarks from the 16s and the color\ntriplets in the 10 so that the massless eigenstates are mixed linear combinations.\nThen the U- and D-quark mass matrices will cease to be proportional and mixing\nwill generically occur.\nWe finish with some comments about possible extensions/generalizations of the model.\nThere is some freedom in the choice of line bundles in the U(1)\u2032i associated to each\nmatter curve. For example, instead of bundles L\u2032\u03a3i = O\u03a3i (3)1/2 for both \u03a31 and \u03a32\nwe could have chosen L\u2032\u03a31 = O\u03a31 (4)1/2 and L\u2032\u03a32 = O\u03a32 (2)1/2 , or even L\u2032\u03a31 = O\u03a31 (5)1/2\nand L\u2032\u03a32 = O\u03a32 (1)1/2 . With these alternative choices one also gets three net quark/lepton\ngenerations. However one can easily check that with asymmetric assignments the massless\nspectrum includes extra vector-like multiplets beyond the standard three generations.\nAlso in these cases always some quark or lepton remains massless.\nThe case with three generations is also somewhat special in these SO(10) GUT's. Indeed, although in principle one can get any number of generations, three is the minimal\nnumber for which the spectrum does not contain additional vector-like matter fields. Note\nalso in this respect that the bigger the number of generations, the bigger the U(1)\u2032 instanton numbers n1 and n2 . A larger number of generations would make more difficult the\neventual embedding of the local model into a complete global F-theory compactification.\nThis is because U(1) backgrounds induce D3-brane charge and the latter is bounded in a\ncompact model.\nOne can also consider adding fluxes along the U(1) in the branching of SO(10) into\n18\n\n\fSU(5) \u00d7 U(1)5 . Flipped SU(5) models with this kind of flux were considered in [9].\nHowever, it is easy to check that allowing for this U(1) flux to go through the matter\ncurves does not add anything new to the problem of Yukawa couplings. This is obvious\nsince the gauge group SU(5) remains unbroken and its representations contain both leftand right-handed fermions unified.\n\n5\n\nA SU (5) F-theory GUT model\n\nWe now discuss the case of SU(5) GUT's. Consider then a bulk 7-brane with gauge group\nSU(5). In the simplest situations 10s are obtained at curves where the SU(5) singularity\nis enhanced to SO(10) whereas 5s will appear at curves where the singularity in enhanced\nto SU(6). At points at which these curves intersect the symmetry is further enhanced to\nE6 or SO(12). This is the case of the examples considered in [9]. In particular we have\nthe branchings\nE6 \u2283 SU(5) \u00d7 U(1)1 \u00d7 U(1)2\n(5.1)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n78 = Adjoints + (10, \u22121, \u22123) + (10, 4, 0) + (5, \u22123, 3) + (1, 5, 3) + c.c.\n\nSO(12) \u2283 SU(5) \u00d7 U(1)3 \u00d7 U(1)4\n\u0002\n\u0003\n66 = Adjoints + (10, 4, 0) + (5, \u22122, 2) + (5, \u22122, \u22122) + c.c.\n\n(5.2)\n\nThe first branching shows that two 10s from different Riemann curves can form a Yukawa\ncoupling with some 5. On the other hand, the second shows that one of the 10 curves\n(but not the other) may couple also to pairs of 5's to provide for D-quark and lepton\nYukawas. One can now think of constructing a model with two 10 curves and one matter\n5 curve and repeating the reshuffling idea we used before but using now hypercharge flux\nthrough the two curves associated to the 10s. However, it is easy to realize that this\ncannot possibly work. The problem is that after turning on the hyperflux, as we will see\nbelow, the three generations of quarks and leptons from the 10s split into two sets with\n\u03a31 and \u03a32 containing respectively (3 \u00d7 ER + 2 \u00d7 QL + 1 \u00d7 UR ) and (2 \u00d7 UR + 1 \u00d7 QL ).\nNow, according to our observation above, only one of the 10 curves (in particular \u03a32 )\nmay couple to 5s to form Yukawas. That means that only one D-quark generation and no\nleptons would be allowed to get Yukawas. This shows that in an F-theory SU(5) GUT in\n19\n\n\fwhich matter resides on curves with minimal rank enhancing the presence of flux through\nthe matter curves cannot possibly solve by itself the Yukawa coupling problem.\nOn the other hand, the fact that SO(10) contains SU(5) as a subgroup and that we\nwere able to build a SO(10) model with no Yukawa problem already tells us that it should\nbe possible to construct SU(5) GUT's with the appropriate properties to solve it. Since\nSO(10) has rank higher in one unit this means that the adequate couplings should be\npossible if in the matter curves the SU(5) singularity is enhanced in two units up to E6 .\nThis double enhancing in the rank of the singularity is indeed possible, as remarked in\n[15]. In these matter curves both 10s and 5s can be present. We know that a 16 of\nSO(10) contains these SU(5) multiplets, the relevant branching being\nSO(10) \u2283 SU(5) \u00d7 U(1)5\n\n(5.3)\n\n16 = (10, \u22121) + (5, 3) + (1, \u22125) .\nThen, the E7 branching (2.2) indicates that one can consider a pair of curves \u03a31 and \u03a32\neach supporting a 10, a 5, and a singlet. At the intersection of these curves the symmetry\nis enhanced to E7 , just like in the SO(10) GUT of the previous section. As remarked in\n[15], in these doubly enhanced singularity curves there could be in principle additional\nmatter fields from the further Higgssing of SO(10) down to SU(5). In what follows we\nwill ignore this issue and simply examine what would be the effect on the Yukawas of\nnon-vanishing fluxes through these matter curves. An specific local realization of curves\nand bundles is summarized in table 2. An sketch of the matter curves involved is depicted\nin figure 3. The structure is quite analogous to the previous SO(10) model. The main\ndifference is that we have an SU(5) symmetry on S which is broken down to the SM by\nhypercharge fluxes. Furthermore, now there are simultaneous fluxes along U(1)\u2032 \u00d7 U(1)5\nthat break GS \u2032 . The corresponding line bundles are denoted L\u2032 and L\u0303.\nWe start from a surface S with 7-branes corresponding to a SU(5) gauge group.\nSwitching on magnetic flux through the hypercharge direction breaks the GUT symmetry.

As remarked in [9], with the choice\nL = OS (E1 \u2212 E2 )1/5\n\n(5.5)\n\nthe exotics [(3, 2, \u22125) + (3, 2, 5)] are absent from the massless spectrum.\nLet us now study the effect of the fluxes on the matter curves containing quarks and\nleptons. We will assume that there are two genus zero curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 in which the\nSU(5) symmetry is doubly enhanced up to E6 . As we said, at each of these curves there\nare three types of multiplets, 10, 5, and a singlet. In the intersecting 7-branes wrapping\nS1\u2032 and S2\u2032 there are bundles along U(1)\u2032 and another U(1)5 . To make contact with the\nprevious SO(10) model it is important to realize that the U(1)B\u2212L generator may be\nexpressed in terms of hypercharge and U(1)5 as follows\nQB\u2212L =\n\n1\n(2Y \u2212 3Q5 ) .\n5\n\n(5.6)\n\nThis relation helps to understand the data in table 2. Note that the first Chern classes\n\u2032\n\nq5\nof the restricted line bundles L\u2032q\n\u03a31 \u2297 L\u0303\u03a31 felt by the various multiplets in \u03a31 are given\n\n21\n\n\f\u03a31\n1,2,3\n\n\u03a32\n\n1,2,3\n\n1,2,3\n\nE , NR\n\nL\n\nR\n\n1,2 1,2\n\nQ1,2\nL\n\nU ,D R\nR\n\n3\nQL\n\n3\n\n3\n\nUR,D R\n\nSU(5)\n\n\u03a3H\nH+H\nu d\n\nFigure 3: Sketch of the structure of the hypercharge fluxed SU (5) model.\n3\nq5 + 32 q \u2032 , where q \u2032 = 1 and q5 is the U(1)5 charge in eq.(5.4). For \u03a32 the Chern\nby \u2212 10\n\nclasses are instead\n\n3\nq + 23 q \u2032 .\n10 5\n\nNow, by virtue of eq.(5.6), it follows that the total degree of\nq\n\n\u2032q \u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nLY\u03a31 \u2297 L\u03a31 \u2297 L\u0303q\u03a351 is equal to 21 qBL + 23 q \u2032 , which is precisely the total degree of L\u03a3B\u2212L\n\u2297 L\u2032q\n\u03a31\n1\nin the SO(10) model. For \u03a32 there is also perfect matching with the SO(10) bundles in\ntable 1. The important point is that along the matter curves \u03a3i there is actually U(1)B\u2212L\nflux (rather than just hypercharge), with \u03a31 and \u03a32 getting opposite fluxes. Given this\nfact, everything is quite similar to the parent SO(10) model. In particular, it is easy to\ncheck that the fermions are redistributed as in the SO(10) case.\nAs an example let us see what happens with the fermions belonging to a 10. As shown\nin the table, the restriction of the hypercharge bundle to \u03a31 and \u03a32 are\nL\u03a31 = O\u03a31 (1)1/5 ,\nL\u03a32 = O\u03a32 (\u22121)1/5 ,\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere we have used that (E1 \u2212 E2 ) * \u03a31 = 1 and (E1 \u2212 E2 ) * \u03a32 = \u22121. The spectrum\nfrom the 10 in \u03a31 can be deduced from the multiplicities computed using the data in the\n\n22\n\n\ftable.

The same happens with charged leptons and Dirac\nneutrino masses which are no longer proportional. Again the lesson is that a small mixing\nfor the third generation is predicted, whereas other mixings in the CKM (and neutrino\nmixing) are not generically small.\nThe SU(5) model may be considered in some sense as a variant of the parent SO(10)\nmodel. However it has the advantage that the symmetry breaking down to the SM\ndoes not require explicit field theoretical Higgssing. It would be interesting to find an\nF-theoretical 7-brane recombination process connecting both models. In any event it is\nclear that in order to obtain Yukawa couplings for all fermions the flux of a particular\nU(1), that of U(1)B\u2212L , is required. In the SO(10) model this flux acts in the bulk S\nsurface. In SU(5) the U(1)B\u2212L flux goes through the matter curves, while in the bulk\nonly hypercharge flux is felt.\nLet us make some comments about the phenomenological properties of these SU(5)\nmodels. As in the SO(10) case, right-handed neutrinos appear generically in the spectrum.\nHowever, in the present case possible Majorana right-handed neutrino masses are not\nforbidden by the bulk gauge interactions but only by the U(1)5 and U(1)\u2032 symmetries\nwhose gauge bosons are presumably massive via combination with RR-fields. Under\nthese conditions Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos could appear induced by\nstringy instanton effects [23]. In this model R-parity is automatic due to the absence of\nself-couplings of matter 5-plets. In addition baryon number violating dim=5 operators\nare suppressed just like in its parent SO(10) model.\nAt this level the third generation quarks have no mixing with the first two generations. Experimentally that mixing is of order 10\u22122 \u221210\u22123 so this is a good starting point.\nEventually some corrections should give rise to this mixing. A natural possibility is again\ninstanton induced couplings. Notice in this respect that such mixing is forbidden to leading order by the U(1)\u2032 symmetries under which the fermion curves are charged. Those\nU(1)'s are generically anomalous and their gauge boson massive so that instanton effects\nof the type considered in [23] could give rise to the required non-vanishing but small third\n24\n\n\fgeneration mixing. Instanton effects inducing non-perturbative corrections to Yukawa\ncouplings in perturbative Type II orientifold models have been recently considered in\n[24].\n\n6\n\nFinal comments and outlook\n\nYukawa couplings in F-theory GUT's come from the intersection of three different matter curves. At first sight this fact makes the structure of Yukawa couplings unrealistic,\nunless one assumes that the involved matter curves have a self-intersecting structure.\nIn this paper we have remarked that a slight generalization of the conditions on the\nU(1)Y /U(1)B\u2212L fluxes breaking the GUT symmetry solves this problem in a natural and\nattractive way. When we have two matter curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 giving rise to the same GUT\nrepresentation, instead of requesting that these fluxes vanish in each individual matter\ncurve it is enough to impose that the fluxes, particularly U(1)B\u2212L fluxes, cancel on average\nR\nR\n(i.e. \u03a31 FU (1)B\u2212L + \u03a32 FU (1)B\u2212L = 0). Under these conditions the SM fermions redistribute\n\nasymmetrically on the two matter curves so that Yukawa couplings for all quarks and\nleptons are allowed. This structure predicts suppressed CKM mixing for the third quark\ngeneration and unsuppressed mixing for the rest of the generations and also for leptons.\nThis prediction is in good qualitative agreement with experiment.\nWe have constructed specific local F-theory SO(10) and SU(5) configurations with this\nstructure. It would be interesting to further develop the phenomenology of these models. In particular it would be interesting to explore whether one can find configurations\nwith good quantitative agreement with observed quark/lepton masses and mixings. These\nmodels have the low-energy spectrum of the MSSM. The structure of SUSY-breaking soft\nterms under the assumption of modulus dominance has recently been analysed in [11],\nwhere compatibility with low-energy experimental constraints and radiative electroweak\nsymmetry breaking was shown. The possibility that SUSY is induced by a particular\nvariety of gauge mediation has also been recently studied in [17, 15]. It would be interesting to see whether the splitting of matter fields on two different curves \u03a31 and \u03a32 , as\nexplored in the present paper, has a bearing on these and other phenomenological aspects\nof F-theory GUT's. Let us finally comment that the smallness of the mixing of the third\n25\n\n\fquark generation with the first two families could perhaps be a first hint, together with\ngauge coupling unification, of an underlying F-theory grand unification.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank F.

In this work we mostly consider S = dP8 . The del Pezzo surfaces dPN ,\nN = 1, * * * , 8, are defined as the blowup of P2 at N points. The canonical class of dPN is\nKS = \u2212c1 (S) = \u22123H +\n\nN\nX\n\nEi ,\n\n(A.1)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere H is the hyperplane class and the Ei are exceptional divisors. We will also need\nthe intersections\nH *H =1 ;\n\nH * Ei = 0 ;\n\nEi * Ej = \u2212\u03b4ij .\n\n(A.2)\n\nThe generators \u03b1i = Ei \u2212 Ei+1 , i = 1, * * * , N \u2212 1, and \u03b1N = H \u2212 E1 \u2212 E2 \u2212 E3 , have\nintersection products equal to minus the Cartan matrix of the Lie algebra EN and can be\nregarded as simple roots.\nAn important result is that the admissible line bundles on dPN are in one to one\ncorrespondence with roots of the EN algebra [8, 9]. For example, the line bundle of the\nU(1) flux that breaks the GUT group can be chosen to be L = OS (\u03b1i )1/n . Fractional\nbundles are allowed as long as the physically relevant powers are integers.\nAfter selecting the surface S one has to define the matter curves \u03a3i that must be\ndivisors of S. Since S has complex dimension two, the \u03a3i are Riemann surfaces and their\ngenus is given by\n2gi \u2212 2 = \u03a3i * (\u03a3i + KS ) .\n\n(A.3)\n\nFor instance, for S = dPN , taking \u03a3i = Ei yields gi = 0, as it should because each Ei is\na P1 . We will only consider curves of genus zero or one.\nTo evaluate the degeneracies of charged multiplets living on a matter curve \u03a3 we need\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nq\n\u2032q\n0\nto know h0 (\u03a3, K\u03a3 \u2297 Lq\u03a3 \u2297 L\u2032q\n\u03a3 ) = dimC H\u2202 \u0304 (\u03a3, K\u03a3 \u2297 L\u03a3 \u2297 L\u03a3 ). The product of line\n\nbundles is another line bundle of degree equal to the degree of its associated divisor. A\nuseful result is that when \u03a3 has genus zero h0 (\u03a3, O\u03a3 (d)) vanishes when the degree d is\nnegative and it is equal to (d + 1) for d \u2265 0.\n27\n\n\fThe restricted bundle L\u03a3 is determined by the line bundle L on S that is introduced\nfrom the start to break the GUT group GS . Since L has a corresponding divisor D on S,\nL\u03a3 will be a line bundle of degree equal to \u03a3 * D. On the other hand, the form of the line\nbundle L\u2032 on the intersecting surface S \u2032 need not be given explicitly because the gauge\ntheory on S \u2032 is completely decoupled. One only has to specify the restriction L\u2032\u03a3 .\nWhen \u03a3 has genus zero the restricted line bundles can be characterized by their\ndegrees. However, when \u03a3 has genus one it is necessary to give the associated divisor that\nmight be effective or not. A divisor D of \u03a3 can be written as a formal linear combination\nof irreducible codimension one hypersurfaces. Since \u03a3 is a curve, these hypersurfaces are\nP\npoints pm and D = m am pm . The divisor is effective if am > 0, \u2200m. The degree of D is\nP\nequal to m am .\n\n28\n\n\fReferences\n[1] G. Aldazabal, L. E. Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, F. Quevedo and A. M.
