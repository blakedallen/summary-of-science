Although quantum mechanics dictates that these coherence effects are intrinsic in certain systems, even when the atoms or particles are nonlocal, there is an overall weakening due to coupling to noisy environments [5] that eventually\nleads to the fast decay of entanglement [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], as in the case of amplitude or phase\nnoise, or even the sudden death of entanglement (ESD) in the worst scenarios [11, 12, 13, 14,\n15]. As such, the study of the controlled entanglement dynamics is of much importance to\nthe prospects of maintaining quantum information [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Moreover,\nmodel systems that theoretically exhibit the rebirth of entanglement have been proposed and\ndiscussed in several cases [24, 25, 26, 27].\nIn this paper, we consider a model system consisting of two uncoupled qubits A and B\ninteracting with stochastic fields, fA (t) and fB (t), respectively, shown in Fig.1. The setup\nof the system is quite similar to the two-qubit local dephasing channel of [8] in which the\nqubits were found to disentangle in a shorter time than their individual atom-field local dephasing times. On the other hand, if the two qubits are coupled to a common environment,\nDepartment of Physics and Engineering Physics, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ 07030, USA\nEmails: \u2020 bcorn@stevens.edu, \u2217 ting.yu@stevens.edu\n\n\f2\n\nthen entanglement was shown to be preserved for a class of initial states living in a subspace\ncalled decoherence-free subspace (DFS) [28, 29]. By introducing a correlation between the\ntwo noisy sources, we can show that the entanglement between the two qubits can be enhanced or reduced by properly choosing the correlation of the two participating external\nnoises.\nThe paper is organized as follows: We present the specifics of the model system in\nSection II, which leads to deriving the master equation in the Markov regimes. The entanglement evolution under the correlated noisy sources are studied in Section III. We have\nshown that dependent on initial states the correlation between two external noises can either\nenhance or reduce the existing entanglement of the qubit systems. We conclude in Section\nIV.\n\n2 Qubit Model and the Master Equation\nOur model consists of two identical, separated qubits (two-level atoms, spins, excitons, etc.)\neach having transition frequency \u03c9 and each coupled to a separate classical random field,\nfA (t) and fB (t) respectively. The total Hamiltonian for this system is (setting h\u0304 = 1)\n\n\u03c9 A\n(1)\n(\u03c3 + \u03c3zB ) + fA (t)\u03c3xA + fB (t)\u03c3xB .\n2 z\nThis Hamiltonian is familiar in condensed matter theory as an extension of the spin-boson\nmodel in the semiclassical regime [30]. The classical stochastic fields are assumed to obey\nthe following correlation relations in the Markov approximation:\nHtot =\n\nM[ fA (t)] = M[ fB (t)] = 0,\n\n(2)\n\nM[ fA (t) fA (s)] = \u03b3A \u03b4 (t \u2212 s),\n\n(3)\n\nM[ fA (t) fB (s)] = \u0393 \u03b4 (t \u2212 s),\n\n(5)\n\nM[ fB (t) fB (s)] = \u03b3B \u03b4 (t \u2212 s),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere M[*] denotes the ensemble average over the classical stochastic fields and for simplicity we assume \u03b3A = \u03b3B = \u03b3 . Obviously, \u0393 determines the respective correlation properties.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nfA(t)\n\nfB(t)\n\nFig. 1 The model is composed of two uncoupled qubits A and B individually coupled to respective stochastic\nfields, fA (t) and fB (t), which are then correlated.\n\n\f3\n\nThe effects of the correlation between the two fields fA (t) and fB (t), M[ fA (t) fB (s)], will be\nrevealed in the study of entanglement between the two qubits.\nThere has been a lot of work dedicated to quantum entanglement dynamics in the presence of an environmental noise, either in classical or quantum regimes (For some recent\nprogress, e.g., see [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]). Clearly, having two separated qubits individually coupled to respective external fields would reveal the same Lindblad dynamics\nfor each qubit. That is, individual couplings always cause the irreversible decay of entanglement. However, when there is a correlation between the two classical stochastic fields,\nwe expect to find new entanglement effects between the two qubits. It can be shown that the\nmaster equation governing the dynamics of two qubits under the influence of two correlated\nnoises can be derived from the corresponding stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger equation [40],\n\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i[HS , \u03c1 ]\n\n(6)\n\n\u22122\u03b3A (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3xA \u03c1\u03c3xA ) \u2212 2\u03b3B (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3xB \u03c1\u03c3xB )\n\u22124\u0393 (\u03c3xA\u03c3xB \u03c1 + \u03c1\u03c3xA \u03c3xB \u2212 \u03c3xA \u03c1\u03c3xB \u2212 \u03c3xB \u03c1\u03c3xA ).\n\nwhere HS = 21 \u03c9 (\u03c3zA + \u03c3zB ) is the Hamiltonian of the two qubits. Upon expanding \u03c3xA and\n\u03c3xB in terms of \u03c3\u00b1A,B , we may obtain a more solvable form to the master equation:\n\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212i[HS , \u03c1 ] \u2212\u03b3A (\u03c3+A \u03c3\u2212A \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3\u2212A \u03c1\u03c3+A \u2212 \u03c3+A \u03c1\u03c3\u2212A + \u03c1\u03c3\u2212A \u03c3+A )\n\n(7)\n\n\u2212\u03b3B (\u03c3+B \u03c3\u2212B \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3\u2212B \u03c1\u03c3+B \u2212 \u03c3+B \u03c1\u03c3\u2212B + \u03c1\u03c3\u2212B \u03c3+B )\n\u2212\u0393 (\u03c3+A \u03c3\u2212B \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3\u2212B \u03c1\u03c3+A \u2212 \u03c3+A \u03c1\u03c3\u2212B + \u03c1\u03c3\u2212B \u03c3+A )\n\u2212\u0393 (\u03c3+B \u03c3\u2212A \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3\u2212A \u03c1\u03c3+B \u2212 \u03c3+B \u03c1\u03c3\u2212A + \u03c1\u03c3\u2212A \u03c3+B ) + H.C.\n\nAt a first glance, Eq. (6) or Eq. (7) immediately displays the dynamics of qubit A in\ncorrelation with field fA (t), dynamics of qubit B while interacting with field fB (t) and the\ncross terms due to the correlation between the two fields. Without the involvement of \u0393 ,\nthe master equation would be the sum of two familiar Lindblad master equations for two\nqubits, respectively. In that case, the two qubits would evolve separately throughout time and\nentanglement between the two qubits will deteriorate with time. The correlation between two\nclassical stochastic fields characterized by \u0393 is expected to affect entanglement evolution in\ntwo different ways dependent on the initial states. We will show for some initial states that\nentanglement can be significantly enhanced by adjusting the cross correlation between the\ntwo fields. However, for some other initial states, the cross-correlation works like a catalyst,\nwhich may accelerate the decay of entanglement.\n\n3 Modulated Entanglement Evolution\nModulated entanglement evolution will of course depend on the state the system was originally in. If the main goal is to try to maintain or improve entanglement, a good initial state\nwould be that which has maximum entanglement, the Bell State, as is presented in cases\n3.1 and 3.2. It is also interesting to see how a general X type matrix behaves under these\ncircumstances, as in case 3.3. It is important to note that \u03b3 and \u0393 cannot be arbitrary and\nmust be chosen in a way that preserves positivity of the density matrix (\u0393 \u2264 \u03b3 ).\n\n\f4\n\n3.1 Bell State (| + +i, | \u2212 \u2212i)\nOne of the Bell States is described by the pure state vector\n1\n|\u03a80 i = \u221a {| + +i + | \u2212 \u2212i},\n2\nwhich has the following density operator representation:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n1\n1\n\uf8f7 1\n\u0001 1 \uf8ec0\n1 \uf8ec\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\u221a 1 001 =\n\u03c1=\u221a \uf8ec\n2 \uf8ed0\n2 \uf8ed0\uf8f8 2\n1\n1\n\n(8)\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n0\uf8f8\n1\n\n(9)\n\nInserting \u03c1 as the initial reduced density matrix, \u03c1 (0), fuels the following master equation solutions:\n1 \u2212(6\u03b3 +\u03ba )t\n[2\u03b3 (1 \u2212 e2\u03ba t ) + \u03ba (2e(6\u03b3 +\u03ba )t + e2\u03ba t + 1)],\ne\n8\u03ba\n1 \u2212(6\u03b3 +\u03ba )t\n[\u22122\u03b3 (1 \u2212 e2\u03ba t ) + \u03ba (2e(6\u03b3 +\u03ba )t \u2212 e2\u03ba t \u2212 1)],\n\u03c122 (t) =\ne\n8\u03ba\n\u0393\n\u03c123 (t) = e\u2212(6\u03b3 +\u03ba )t (e2\u03ba t \u2212 1),\n\u03ba\n1 \u22124\u03b3 t\n\u03c114 (t) = e\n,\n2\np\nwhere we have defined \u03ba \u2261 4\u03b3 2 + 32\u0393 2 . It should be noted that this special initial condition leads to the simple relations:\n\n\u03c111 (t) =\n\n\u03c133 (t) = \u03c122 (t) \u03c144 (t) = \u03c111 (t) \u03c132 (t) = \u03c123 (t) \u03c141 (t) = \u03c114 (t),\n\u03c112 (t) = \u03c113 (t) = \u03c124 (t) = \u03c134 (t) = 0,\n\u03c121 (t) = \u03c131 (t) = \u03c142 (t) = \u03c143 (t) = 0.\nBecause the off-diagnal elements initially at zero will remain at zero for all time, the\ntime-dependent reduced density operator will be of the X form with only 4 independent,\nreal terms:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 \u03c114 (t)\n\u03c111 (t) 0\n\uf8ec 0 \u03c122 (t) \u03c123 (t) 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(10)\n\u03c1 (t) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 \u03c123 (t) \u03c122 (t) 0 \uf8f8 .\n0 \u03c111 (t)\n\u03c114 (t) 0\nWith a solution to the master equation in hand, it is easy to calculate the Concurrence\n[41], a measurement of entanglement ranging between 0 and 1 evaluated as\np\np\np\np\nC(\u03c1 ) = 2 max{0, \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb4 },\n(11)\nwhere \u03bbi represent the eigenvalues of the matrix\n\n\u03c1 = \u03c1 (\u03c3yA \u2297 \u03c3yB )\u03c1 \u2217 (\u03c3yA \u2297 \u03c3yB ),\nin descending order. For this \u03c1 (t), the concurrence throughout time will be\np\nC(\u03c1 (t)) = 2 max{0, |\u03c114 (t)| \u2212 \u03c122 (t)\u03c133 (t)},\n\n(12)\n\n\f5\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\nC\u007f\u03a1\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n!0\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.00\n\n!.5\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n!1\n\n0.20\n\n\u007ft\n\nFig. 2 Concurrence calculated for various values of \u0393 . At times later in the decay of the concurrence, entanglement can be built up by increasing the correlation between the fields.\n\nand is plotted against \u03b3 t in Fig. 2 for various values of \u0393 .\nFor all cases of \u03b3 , when \u0393 = 0, the system exhibits the sudden death of entanglement\nwell-known to the local-dephasing channel [8]. However, by turning on the correlation \u0393\nbetween the stochastic fields, the concurrence curve moves vertically upward, denoting an\nincrease in the measurement of entanglement. Clearly, we displayed controlled entanglement evolution via correlated environmental noises. We also are faced with the fact that\nincreasing the correlation \u03b3 of each atom to their respective fields will also induce a faster\nsudden death of entanglement. By turning on the correlation between the fields to its maximum value, \u0393 = \u03b3 , entanglement is maximally enhanced, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\n3.2 Bell State (| + \u2212i, | \u2212 +i)\nLet's now solve the master equation using the other form of the maximally coherent Bell\nState:\n1\n|\u03a60 i = \u221a {| + \u2212i + | \u2212 +i}.\n2\n\n(13)\n\nThe initial reduced density matrix for this state vector is:\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n0\n\uf8f7 1\n\u0001 1 \uf8ec0\n1 \uf8ec\n1\n\uf8f7\u221a 0 110 = \uf8ec\n\u03c1=\u221a \uf8ec\n2 \uf8ed0\n2 \uf8ed1\uf8f8 2\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n0\n1\n1\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\n(14)\n\nwhich allows us to solve for the time dependent density matrix:\n\n\u03c112 (t) = \u03c113 (t) = \u03c124 (t) = \u03c134 (t) = \u03c114 (t) = 0,\n\u03c121 (t) = \u03c131 (t) = \u03c142 (t) = \u03c143 (t) = \u03c141 (t) = 0.\n\n(15)\n\n\f6\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\nC\u007f\u03a1\n\n0.6\n!0\n\n0.4\n!0.5\n\n0.2\n!1\n\n0.0\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n\u007ft\n\nFig. 3 Concurrence calculated for various values of \u0393 with \u03b3 = 1.

Introducing a\ncorrelation between the noise fields, \u0393 , actually lowers the concurrence curve and causes a\nfaster decay of entanglement. This is true for all values of \u03b3 , displaying the impossibility for\nentanglement enhancement for this initial state evolution. This brings forth a very interesting\ncharacteristic of entanglement, that even in the Markovian regime where there is no memory\nof previous times in the system, it is still very sensitive to which initial state is being used.\nEven though all Bell States produce maximum entanglement, one has the prospect for the\nrebirth of entanglement and the other does not.\n\n\f7\n\n3.3 X state\nWe can now use a more general approach by utilizing an initial state in the X form which\nincludes the Bell states and Werner states as special cases [42]:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\na 0 0 w\u2217\n\uf8ec 0 b z\u2217 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(18)\n\u03c1x = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 z c 0 \uf8f8,\nw0 0 d\nwhere a + b + c + d = 1.

At first entanglement is reduced due to correlated\nnoise but later begins to enhance it.\n\nThe results demonstrate that the entanglement can be significantly enhanced by the\ncross-correlation at late times even though the correlation was detrimentalp\nto entanglement\nat early times. More explicitly, it can be shown that at early time |\u03c123 (t)| \u2212 \u03c111 (t)\u03c144 (t) is\nthe dominant term in the calculation of concurrence, resulting in the degradation\np of entanglement due to the cross-correlation. However, at a certain point |\u03c114 (t)| \u2212 \u03c122 (t)\u03c133 (t)\nbegins to dominate, causing the correlation to enhance the entanglement. This demonstrates\nour ability to improve entanglement for a wide range of initial states and time scales.\n\n4 Conclusion\nIn summary, we studied a system of two separated qubits each coupled to a stochastic field\nwhich can then be correlated, opening the option for the enhancement or reduction of entanglement between the qubits. By solving the master equation for the qubit dynamics under\nvarious initial states and viewing the concurrence as a function of time, the effects of the\ncorrelation between the fields, \u0393 , became imminent. Of our three cases for initial states, the\nBell State, Eq. (9), showed a potential for the regeneration of entanglement. The amount\nof entanglement this particular case can achieve is dependent on the degree of correlation\nbetween the two noises. In the second case we considered the Bell State of Eq. (14) for\nwhich correlation \u0393 did not cause the entanglement between the atoms to be regenerated. In\nfact, it instead reduced the entanglement and caused it to decay at an even faster rate. This\nilluminates a selectivity that entanglement has toward the initial state of the system, even\nunder the memoryless Markov approximation. It is important then to look at the general X\nform density matrix of Section 3.3 allowing us to account for various initial entanglement\nconditions of the system. This case presented the ability to modulate entanglement in either\nway. The range of maximum enhancement was variable depending on the parameters of the\ninitial matrix, giving us a wide range of control over the improvement of entanglement.\nIn general, many characteristic properties of entanglement are still unknown. In this\nmodel system, we have created a bridge from one qubit to the other through the correlation\nof the stochastic fields, allowing for entanglement to be modulated. This correlated noise\napproach can easily be applied to multipartite systems, which in turn might provide an even\nhigher enhancement of entanglement [43, 44, 45, 46]. Finally, it may be worth noting that the\nrelationship between the classical noise model presented here and the fully quantized models\ndiscussed in [17, 18] is an interesting problem that will be addressed in future publications.\n\n\f9\n\n5 Acknowledgements\nWe acknowledge partial financial support from the following agencies: DARPA HR0011-091-0008 and NSF PHY-0925174.
