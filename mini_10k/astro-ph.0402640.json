By improving our understanding of the relevant issues we can hope to\nshed light on the nature of the various dynamical and secular instabilities that may govern the spin-evolution of rotating stars. The\nrelevance of such knowledge for neutron star astrophysics may be\nhighly significant. It is for example not clear (i) whether instabilities may affect nascent neutron stars leading to the slow birth spin\nrates inferred for radio pulsars, (ii) to what extent gravitationalwave driven instabilities may provide the explanation for the observed clustering of spin periods in Low-Mass X-ray Binaries, and\n(iii) if compact stars are likely to evolve through phases where unstable oscillations lead to the emission of a detectable gravitationalwave signal (see the review article by Andersson (2003) for a discussion of these issues and further references).\nThe aim of this (and a subsequent) paper is to develop a Lagrangian perturbation framework for rotating non-relativistic superfluid neutron stars. This leads to the first generalization of Friedman\nand Schutz's classic work (Friedman & Schutz 1978a,b) on the stability properties of rotating stars to models which account for the\npresence of potentially weakly coupled superfluid components. We\nbelieve that our extension of the, by now 25 years old, single fluid\nresults corresponds to a significant step forwards for this area of\nresearch.\nOur analysis is based on the standard two-fluid model\n(Carter 1989; Comer & Langlois 1994; Carter & Langlois\n1998; Langlois et al. 1998; Lindblom & Mendell 2000;\nSedrakian & Wasserman 2000; Andersson & Comer 2001;\nComer 2002; Lee & Yoshida 2003; Yoshida & Lee 2003a,b; Prix\n2004; Carter & Chamel 2003b,a) expected to be relevant for the\nconditions that prevail in the outer core of mature neutron stars. In\n\norder to keep the analysis tractable we are forced to make many\nsimplifying assumptions, but our model nevertheless includes the\nextra degrees of freedom associated with any two-fluid configuration. Most importantly, we allow our stationary background\nconfigurations to be such that the two fluids rotate at different\nrates. This is a key addition to the standard picture. It is a necessary\ninclusion since all seemingly viable models of the large Vela pulsar\nglitches are based on the notion of angular momentum transfer\nbetween different fluid components rotating at different rates. It\nis also an exciting addition to the standard model, because the\nadditional degree of freedom may lead to new phenomena. An\ninteresting example of this is the recently discovered superfluid\ntwo-stream instability (Andersson et al. 2003; Prix et al. 2004;\nAndersson et al. 2002).\nThe layout of this paper is as follows: We begin by introducing the two-fluid model for superfluid stars and the Lagrangian\nperturbation theory that we will employ (Section 2). We then revisit (in Section 3) what should be well-known results for a single (barotropic) fluid model. We also revise those results in such a\nway that the main concepts will remain relevant for the two-fluid\nproblem. Yet they are easier to introduce in the single fluid case.\nHaving developed the necessary tools we then move on to the twofluid case (Section 4). As we will see, the extension of the single\nfluid formulae is relatively straightforward provided that we only\nallow for the direct chemical coupling between the two fluids [for\nthe moment neglecting the entrainment effect (Andreev & Bashkin\n1975; Borumand et al. 1996; Comer & Joynt 2003; Comer 2004),\nthe role of which will be the main focus of a subsequent paper].\nSection 5 then provides a discussion of some implications of our\nresults, which is followed in Section 6 by specific implications for\nthe r-mode instability and gravitational wave emission. Finally, in\nSection 7 we briefly look ahead to the work that will be presented\nin a subsequent paper.\n\n\f2\n\nN. Andersson, G.L. Comer and K. Grosart\n\n2 TWO KEY INGREDIENTS\nWe begin our discussion by introducing the two main ingredients\nof our analysis: The two-fluid model for neutron stars, and the\nLagrangian perturbation theory developed by Friedman & Schutz\n(1978a,b).\n\n2.1 The two-fluid model for superfluid stars\n\nX\n\n\u03bcx dnx + \u03b1dw2 .\n\n(1)\n\nx=n,p\n\nThis leads to the definition of the two chemical potentials\n\u03bcx =\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2202E\n\u2202nx\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nny ,w2\n\nFor later convenience, we introduce the notation \u03bc\u0303x = \u03bcx /mB ,\nwhere we take the two nucleon masses to be equal such that mB =\nmn = mp . We also see that the entrainment coefficient \u03b1 follows\nfrom\n\u03b1=\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2202E\n\u2202w2\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n\u2202t nx + \u2207i (nx vxi ) = 0\n\n(4)\n\nand two coupled Euler equations\n(\u2202t + vxj \u2207j ) (vix + \u03b5x wiyx ) + \u2207i (\u03a6 + \u03bc\nex )\n\n(5)\n\n\u22072 \u03a6 = 4\u03c0mB G (nn + np ) .\n\n(6)\n\n+\u03b5x wjyx \u2207i vxj = 0 .\n\nA mature neutron star is likely to contain several superfluid components. One would certainly expect superfluid neutrons to coexist\nwith the crystal lattice of nuclei that makes up the outer kilometer or\nso of the star. In the outer parts of the fluid core superfluid neutrons\nare expected to coexist with superconducting protons, while the\ndeep core may contain exotic states of matter like superfluid hyperons and perhaps even colour-superconducting deconfined quarks.\nThe modelling of a star comprising all these components is far beyond our current means. In fact, the parameters governing the possible states are uncertain to say the least. Given this, most investigations into the dynamics of superfluid neutron stars have considered\na much simplified scenario that accounts for the presence of two\ndistinct fluid components.\nThe two-fluid picture of superfluid neutron stars is based on\nthe notion that the outer core is dominated by superfluid neutrons,\nsuperconducting protons and electrons. Since the charged components couple electromagnetically on a short timescale they are assumed to move together. This assumption should be valid as long\nas we consider dynamics that takes place on a timescale long compared to that associated with the electromagnetic interaction. The\noutcome is a model describing the motion of the neutrons and the\n\"protons\" (a conglomerate of the charged components).\nThe equations that describe the two-fluid model are derived\nfrom an energy functional E(nn , np , w2 ) where nx are the two\nnumber densities. Given the two fluid velocities vix the quantity\ni\n\u2261 vyi \u2212vxi ) represents the relative velocity bewiyx \u2261 viy \u2212vix (wyx\ni\nwiyx .\ntween the two fluids, for ease of notation we define w2 \u2261 wyx\nThroughout this paper we will use the constituent indices x = n, p\nand y 6= x. This allows us to condense the various equations significantly, but in order to avoid confusion we should stress that repeated constituent indices never imply summation, while repeated\nvector component indices always do. It is also worth pointing out\nthat all calculations will be carried out in a coordinate basis. Hence,\nwe will distinguish between co- and contravariant vectors etcetera.\nOnce we are supplied with the energy functional (the equation\nof state) a straightforward variation yields\ndE =\n\nthe fully relativistic equations derived by Carter and collaborators\n(Carter 1989; Comer & Langlois 1994; Carter & Langlois 1998;\nLanglois et al. 1998). The end result is two continuity equations\n\n(3)\n\nnn ,np\n\nThe dynamical equations that govern the two coupled fluids\ncan be derived either from a Newtonian variational principle (Prix\n2004) or from the Newtonian limit (Andersson & Comer 2001) of\n\nHere we have defined \u03b5x = 2\u03b1/nx . We also have the standard\nPoisson equation for the gravitational potential \u03a6;\n\nWe assume the background to be stationary and axisymmetric,\nwith the two fluids rotating around the z-axis with rates \u03a9n and \u03a9p\nrespectively. Hence we have\nvxi = \u03a9x \u03c6i\n\ni\nand wyx\n= (\u03a9y \u2212 \u03a9x )\u03c6i\n\n(7)\n\ni\n\nwith \u03c6 given by\n\u03c6i \u2202i = \u2202\u03c6 .\n\n(8)\n\nIn spherical coordinates, i.e. xi \u2208 {r, \u03b8, \u03c6} , this vector has the\ncomponents \u03c6i = (0, 0, 1), and its norm is \u03c6i \u03c6i = r 2 sin2 \u03b8.\nIn order to simplify the analysis, we restrict our attention to\nmodels with uniform rotation, i.e. take \u03a9x to be constants. Furthermore, in order to elucidate the details we will only consider the case\nof vanishing entrainment. That is, we let \u03b1 = 0. The motivation for\nthis is simple: If we could not make progress even in this restricted\ncase, it would be pointless to consider the much more complicated\nproblem which includes the entrainment. However, as we will see,\nthe case of vanishing entrainment works out very neatly. Hence\nthere is every reason for optimism, and we will return to the case\n\u03b1 6= 0 in a subsequent paper.\n2.2 Lagrangian perturbation theory\nOur aim is to derive conserved quantities for the perturbations of\nthe system of equations described above. By doing this we hope to\nbe able to provide criteria that can be used to decide when the oscillations of a rotating superfluid neutron star are unstable. The need\nfor such criteria is clear given that i) the astrophysical relevance\nof the gravitational-wave driven r-mode instability may to a large\nextent depend on whether the star contains superfluid components\n(Andersson 2003), and ii) the dynamical two-stream instability may\nset in above a critical relative rotation rate (Andersson et al. 2003;\nPrix et al. 2004; Andersson et al. 2002). A detailed analysis of both\nthese problems clearly requires an improved understanding of the\nstability properties of superfluid stars.\nFollowing Friedman & Schutz (1978a,b), we analyze the\nproblem within the Lagrangian perturbation formalism. The Lagrangian variation \u2206Q of a quantity Q is related to the Eulerian\nvariation \u03b4Q by\n\u2206Q = \u03b4Q + \u00a3\u03be Q\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the Lie derivative \u00a3\u03be has the meaning\n\u00a3 \u03be f = \u03be i \u2207i f\n\n(10)\n\nfor scalars,\n\u00a3 \u03be v i = \u03be j \u2207j v i \u2212 v j \u2207j \u03be i\nfor contravariant vectors, and\n\n(11)\n\n\fLagrangian perturbation theory of nonrelativistic rotating superfluid stars\n\u00a3\u03be vi = \u03be j \u2207j vi + vj \u2207i \u03be j\n\n(12)\n\nfor covariant vectors.\nThe Lagrangian change in the fluid velocity follows from\n\u2206v i = \u2202t \u03be i\n\n\u0010\n\n(\u2202t + \u00a3v )vi + \u2207i \u03bc\u0303 + \u03a6 \u2212\n\n\u0011\n\n1 2\nv =0.\n2\n\n3\n(24)\n\nThis form is particularly useful since the Lagrangian variation commutes with the operator \u2202t + \u00a3v , i.e.\n(13)\n\n\u2206(\u2202t + \u00a3v )vi = (\u2202t + \u00a3v )\u2206vi .\n\n(25)\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03be is the Lagrangian displacement.

In doing this we want to stay as close as possible to\nthe equations used to describe the two-fluid problem. We know\nfrom previous work that the relevant model to compare to is a\nbarotropic perfect fluid, eg. since the g-modes are absent from the\npulsation spectrum of a non-rotating superfluid model (Lee 1995;\nAndersson & Comer 2001; Comer 2002). Furthermore, we prefer\nto work with the number density n, the fluid velocity vi and the\nchemical potential \u03bc rather than the pressure P .\n3.1 The perturbation equations\nFrom thermodynamic principles we know that, for a barotropic ordinary fluid we have E = E(n), and\n\n(\u2202t + v j \u2207j )vi + \u2207i (\u03bc\u0303 + \u03a6) = 0\n\n\u0010 \u2202 \u03bc\u0303 \u0011\n\u2202n\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2202 \u03bc\u0303\n\u03b4n + \u03be i \u2207i \u03bc\u0303\n\u2202n\n\n\u2207i (n\u03be i ) + \u03be i \u2207i \u03bc\u0303 .\n\n(28)\n\nGiven this, we have arrived at the following form for the perturbed\nEuler equation\n\n3 REVISITING AND REVISING THE SINGLE FLUID\nPROBLEM\n\n1\nd\u03bc = dP .\nn\nThis allows us to write the standard Euler equation as\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0010\n\n(18)\n\n\u2202t2 \u03bei + 2v j \u2207j \u2202t \u03bei + (v j \u2207j )2 \u03bei + \u2207i \u03b4\u03a6 + \u03be j \u2207i \u2207j (\u03a6 + \u03bc\u0303)\nh\u0010 \u0011\ni\n\u2202 \u03bc\u0303\n\u2212\u2207i\n\u2207j (n\u03be j ) = 0 .

A slightly more\ninvolved calculation leads to\n\nand the Poisson equation for the gravitational potential\n\u22072 \u03a6 = 4\u03c0mB Gn .\n\nWe now want to perturb these equations. First of all, conservation of mass for the perturbations is readily expressed as\n\u2206n = \u2212n\u2207i \u03be i \u2212\u2192 \u03b4n = \u2212\u2207i (n\u03be i ) .\n\n(22)\n\nConsequently, the perturbed gravitational potential follows from\n\u22072 \u03b4\u03a6 = 4\u03c0GmB \u03b4n = \u22124\u03c0GmB \u2207i (n\u03be i ) .\n\n(23)\n\nIn order to perturb the Euler equations we first rewrite Eq.

Given this, it\nis straightforward to show that W (\u03b7, \u03be) is conserved, i.e. \u2202t W = 0.\nThis leads us to define the canonical energy of the system as\nmB\nmB\nEc =\nW (\u2202t \u03be, \u03be) =\n{h\u2202t \u03be, A\u2202t \u03bei + h\u03be, C\u03bei} .\n(37)\n2\n2\nAfter some manipulations, we arrive at the following explicit expression\nW (\u03b7, \u03be) = \u03b7, A\u2202t \u03be +\n\nEc =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\b\n\n\u0010\n\no\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2202\u03bc\n1\n|\u2207i \u03b4\u03a6|2 dV (38)\n|\u03b4n|2 \u2212\n\u2202n\n4\u03c0G\nwhich can be compared to Eq. (45) of Friedman & Schutz (1978a).\nIn the case of an axisymmetric system, eg. a rotating star, we\ncan also define a canonical angular momentum as\n\nD\n\nE\n\n1\nmB\nW (\u2202\u03c6 \u03be, \u03be) = \u2212 Re \u2202\u03c6 \u03be, A\u2202t \u03be + B\u03be .\n(39)\n2\n2\nThe proof that this quantity is conserved relies on the fact that (i)\nW (\u03b7, \u03be) is conserved for any two solutions to the perturbed Euler equations, and (ii) \u2202\u03c6 commutes with \u03c1v j \u2207j in axisymmetry,\nwhich means that if \u03be solves the Euler equations then so does \u2202\u03c6 \u03be.\nAs elucidated by Friedman & Schutz (1978a,b), the stability\nanalysis is complicated by the presence of so-called \"trivial\" displacements. These trivials can be thought of as \"integration constants\" representing a relabeling of the physical fluid elements. A\ntrivial displacement \u03b6 i leaves the physical quantities unchanged,\ni.e. is such that \u03b4n = \u03b4v i = 0. This means that we must have\n\nJc = \u2212\n\n\u2022 Dynamical instabilities are only possible for motions such that\nEc = 0. This makes intuitive sense since the amplitude of a mode\nfor which Ec vanishes can grow without bounds and still obey the\nconservation laws.\n\u2022 If the system is coupled to radiation (eg. gravitational waves)\nwhich carries positive energy away from the system (which should\nbe taken to mean that \u2202t Ec < 0) then any initial data for which\nEc < 0 will lead to an unstable evolution.\nConsider a real frequency normal-mode solution to the per\u02c6 i(\u03c9t+m\u03c6) . One can\nturbation equations, a solution of form \u03be = \u03bee\nreadily show that the associated canonical energy becomes\n\nh\n\ni\n\ni\nh\u03be, B\u03bei\n(44)\n2\nwhere the expression in the bracket is real valued. For the canonical\nangular momentum we get\nEc = \u03c9 \u03c9 h\u03be, A\u03bei \u2212\n\n\u03c1|\u2202t \u03be|2 \u2212 \u03c1|v j \u2207j \u03bei |2 + \u03c1\u03be i \u03be j\u2217 \u2207i \u2207j (\u03bc\u0303 + \u03a6)\n+\n\nThe importance of the canonical energy stems from the fact that it\ncan be used to test the stability of the system. In particular, we note\nthat:\n\nh\n\ni\n\ni\nh\u03be, B\u03bei .\n(45)\n2\nCombining Eq. (44) and Eq. (45) we see that, for real frequency modes we will have\n\u03c9\n(46)\nEc = \u2212 Jc = \u03c3p Jc\nm\nwhere \u03c3p is the pattern speed of the mode.\nNow notice that Eq. (45) can be rewritten as\nJc = \u2212m \u03c9 h\u03be, A\u03bei \u2212\n\nh\u03be, i\u03c1~v * \u2207\u03bei\nJc\n= \u2212m\u03c9 + m\n.\n\u02c6 \u03c1\u03be\u02c6\n\u02c6 \u03c1\u03be\u02c6\n\u03be,\n\u03be,\n\nUsing cylindrical coordinates, and v j = \u03a9\u03c6j , one can show that\n\u02c6 2 + i(\u03be\u02c6\u2217 \u00d7 \u03be)\n\u02c6 z] .\n\u2212 i\u03c1\u03bei\u2217 v j \u2207j \u03be i = \u03c1\u03a9[m|\u03be|\n\n=\n\n0,\n\n(40)\n\n\u02c62\n|(\u03be\u02c6\u2217 \u00d7 \u03be\u0302)z | 6 |\u03be|\n\ni\n\n=\n\n0.\n\n(41)\n\nand we must have (for uniform rotation)\n\n(\u2202t + \u00a3v )\u03b6\n\nThe solution to the first of these equations can be written\n\u03c1\u03b6 i = \u01ebijk \u2207j \u03c7k\n\nwhere, in order to satisfy the second equations, the vector \u03c7k must\nhave time-dependence such that\n(\u2202t + \u00a3v )\u03c7k = 0 .\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c3p \u2212 \u03a9 1 +\n(42)\n\n(43)\n\nThis means that the trivial displacement will remain constant\nalong the background fluid trajectories. Or, as Friedman & Schutz\n(1978a) put it, the \"initial relabeling is carried along with the unperturbed motion.\"\nThe trivials may cause trouble because they affect the canonical energy. Before one can use the canonical energy to assess the\nstability of a rotating configuration one must deal with this \"gauge\nproblem.\" The way to do this is to ensure that the displacement\nvector \u03be is orthogonal to all trivials. A prescription for doing this is\nprovided by Friedman & Schutz (1978a). In particular, they show\nthat the required canonical perturbations preserve the vorticity of\nthe individual fluid elements. Most importantly, one can also prove\nthat a normal mode solution is orthogonal to the trivials. Thus, normal mode solutions can serve as canonical initial data, and be used\nto assess stability.\n\n(48)\n\nBut\n\n\u2207i (\u03c1\u03b6 )\n\ni\n\n(47)\n\n1\nm\n\n\u0011\n\n(49)\n\n6\n\n\u0010\n\nJc /m2\n1\n6 \u03c3p \u2212 \u03a9 1 \u2212\n\u02c6 \u03c1\u03be\u02c6\nm\n\u03be,\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(50)\n\nEq. (50) forms an integral part of the Friedman & Schutz\n(1978b) proof that rotating perfect fluid stars are generically unstable in the presence of radiation. The argument is as follows: Consider modes with finite frequency in the \u03a9 \u2192 0 limit. Then Eq. (50)\nimplies that co-rotating modes (with \u03c3p > 0) must have Jc > 0,\nwhile counter-rotating modes (for which \u03c3p < 0) will have Jc < 0.\nIn both cases Ec > 0, which means that both classes of modes are\nstable. Now consider a small region near a point where \u03c3p = 0 (at a\nfinite rotation rate). Typically, this corresponds to a point where the\ninitially counter-rotating mode becomes co-rotating. In this region\nJc < 0. However, Ec will change sign at the point where \u03c3p (or,\nequivalently, the frequency \u03c9) vanishes. Since the mode was stable\nin the non-rotating limit this change of sign indicates the onset of\ninstability at a critical rate of rotation.\n3.4 Example: The r-mode instability\nIn order to further demonstrate the usefulness of the canonical energy, let us prove the instability of the single-fluid r-modes.\n\n\fLagrangian perturbation theory of nonrelativistic rotating superfluid stars\n4 THE SUPERFLUID PROBLEM\n\nFor a general inertial mode we have (cf.

We clearly need to deal with\ntwo sets of trivial displacements, one for each fluid degree of freedom. Fortunately, the analysis of these trivials is essentially identical to that of the single barotropic fluid case discussed in Sec. 3,\nsee Friedman & Schutz (1978a) for further details.\nIn the superfluid problem, the trivial displacements are such\nthat\n\u03b4nx = \u03b4vix = 0 .\n\n(98)\n\nIt is easy to see from the superfluid perturbation equations that the\ntwo sets of equations that determine the functional form of the trivials are identical to the corresponding single fluid equations. This\nmeans\nthat the single fluid result can be adapted to the superfluid\n. (93)\nproblem: we simply have one trivial displacement (\u03b6x ) per fluid.\nIn our case, we can take the requirement that the canonical\ndisplacements \u03bex must be \"orthogonal\" to the trivials to mean that\nwe should have\nWn (\u03b6n , \u03ben ) = Wp (\u03b6p , \u03bep ) = 0 .\n\n(99)\n\nThis condition leads to the trivial displacements having identical\nform to those of the single-fluid problem. However, it is worth\nnoticing that we could in principle permit the somewhat less restrictive condition\nWn (\u03b6n , \u03ben ) + Wp (\u03b6p , \u03bep ) = 0\n\n(100)\n\nand still ensure that the trivial displacements do not affect our conserved quantities. We have not yet investigated the implications of\nthis possibility.\nFinally, and most importantly, one can readily extend the calculation of Friedman & Schutz (1978a) to prove that normal modes\nare (usually) orthogonal to the trivials also in the present case. In\nother words, normal modes may serve as canonical initial data. This\nis extremely useful as we hope to use the canonical energy and angular momentum to assess the stability of various superfluid normal\nmode solutions.\n\n(96)\n\nOne can readily verify that these formulas lead to the given results.\nIn an axisymmetric system we can also define a conserved\nangular momentum;\nJc = \u2212\n\n7\n\nmB\nmB\nWn (\u2202\u03c6 \u03ben , \u03ben ) \u2212\nWp (\u2202\u03c6 \u03bep , \u03bep )\n2\nE\nnD 2\n1\n= \u2212mB Re\n\u2202\u03c6 \u03ben , An \u2202t \u03ben + Bn \u03ben\n2\nD\nEo\n1\n+ \u2202\u03c6 \u03bep , Ap \u2202t \u03bep + Bp \u03bep\n. (97)\n2\n\nNow one can readily use Eq. (92) and Eq. (97) to prove that,\nfor a normal mode solution to the problem, \u03bex = \u03be\u02c6x ei(m\u03c6+\u03c9t) , the\ncanonical energy and angular momentum will still be related by\nEq. (46). Furthermore, it follows that we must have Ec = Jc = 0\nfor dynamically unstable (complex frequency) modes, just like in\nthe single fluid case. This is hardly surprising, but it could turn out\nto be a very useful result. One could, for example, hope to be able\nto use our expressions for the canonical energy and angular momentum to derive necessary criteria for the superfluid two-stream\ninstability (Andersson et al. 2003; Prix et al. 2004; Andersson et al.\n2002).\n\n5 INSTABILITIES OF ROTATING SUPERFLUID STARS\nThe main motivation for the present investigation was the lack of\nproper instability criteria for rotating superfluid stars. The need\nfor such criteria is clear given that it has long been acknowledged that the astrophysical relevance of the gravitational-wave\ndriven CFS instability (of both f- and r-modes) may depend on\nthe extent to which superfluid dissipation [like mutual friction\n(Lindblom & Mendell 1995, 2000)] counteracts the growth of the\nunstable mode. It would seem obvious that, before worrying about\nsuch issues, one ought to establish that the instability is actually\npresent once the star becomes superfluid. We are not aware of any\nsuch proof, despite the number of investigations of unstable oscillations of superfluid stars that exist in the literature. It should be clear\nthat this is a non-trivial issue given the simple fact that the two\nfluids are only weakly coupled, and may in fact rotate at different\nrates.\nIn this section we provide the first applications of our conserved canonical energy and angular momentum for the two fluid\nproblem. We first present an argument in favour of the simple single\nfluid criterion for CFS instability-that the instability sets in when\nthe pattern speed of an originally backwards moving mode passes\n\n\f8\n\nN. Andersson, G.L. Comer and K. Grosart\n\nthrough zero in the inertial frame-holding also in the superfluid\nproblem. Having done this, we discuss the superfluid r-mode instability.\n\nThis concludes the proof that the criterion for the onset of radiation\ndriven instabilities of modes that have a finite frequency limit as\n\u03a9 \u2192 0 remains as in the single fluid case. Modes become unstable\nwhen the (inertial frame) pattern speed changes sign.\n\n5.1 The superfluid CFS instability\nThe main question here is: Does the simple criterion that a counterrotating mode becomes unstable when the pattern speed changes\nsign remain valid also in the two-fluid problem? Intuitively, one\nmight expect this to be the case, but it nevertheless warrants a proof.\nWe approach the problem as in the single fluid case. Assuming a real frequency mode solution to the perturbation equations,\nEq. (97) leads to\n\n6 THE SUPERFLUID R-MODE INSTABILITY\n\nTo conclude this paper we will discuss some aspects of the r-mode\ninstability for rotating superfluid stars. Although we are not yet at\na point where we can discuss the general problem (since we did\nnot include entrainment in our derivation), we can still learn quite\na lot about the issues that arise when we consider two coupled fluids. Furthermore, we are not aware of any previous proof of the\npresence of an instability in the case when the two fluids rotate at\nJc = \u2212m {\u03c9[h\u03ben , \u03c1n \u03ben i + h\u03bep , \u03c1p \u03bep i]\ndifferent rates. The nature of the various inertial modes of oscilla\u2212 [h\u03ben , i\u03c1n~vn * \u2207\u03ben i + h\u03bep , i\u03c1p~vp * \u2207\u03bep i]} .\n(101)\ntion (of which the r-modes form a sub-class) of a superfluid star\nhas, however, been discussed by several authors. We will draw on\nDivide through to get\nthese investigations for information concerning the nature of the rmodes in both (i) the general case of a background star such that\nJc\nthe two fluids rotate at different rates (although with respect to the\nh\u03ben , \u03c1n \u03ben i + h\u03bep , \u03c1p \u03bep i\nsame axis), and (ii) the special case of co-rotating fluids.\nh\u03ben , i\u03c1n~vn * \u2207\u03ben i + h\u03bep , i\u03c1p~vp * \u2207\u03bep i\n.(102)\n= \u2212m\u03c9 + m\nh\u03ben , \u03c1n \u03ben i + h\u03bep , \u03c1p \u03bep i\nUsing cylindrical coordinates, we see from the results in\nSec. 3.3 that\n\u2217 j\n\u2212 i\u03c1n \u03beni\nvn \u2207j \u03beni = \u03c1n \u03a9n [m|\u03ben |2 + i(\u03ben\u2217 \u00d7 \u03ben )z ] .\n\n(103)\n\nWe then know that\n\u2217 j\n\u03c1n \u03a9n (m \u2212 1)|\u03ben |2 6 \u2212i\u03c1n \u03beni\nv \u2207j \u03beni 6 \u03c1n \u03a9n (m + 1)|\u03ben |2 (104)\n2\n\n(105)\n\nwhere we have defined ax = h\u03bex , \u03c1x \u03bex i > 0. We also get\nh\u03bex , i\u03c1x~vx * \u2207\u03bex i 6 \u2212(m \u2212 1)\u03a9x ax .\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n1\n[\u03a9n an + \u03a9p ap ] 6 Jc /m2\nm\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1\n6 \u03c3p (an + ap ) \u2212\n1\u2212\n[\u03a9n an + \u03a9p ap ] .(107)\n2\nm\n\nThis is the relation we need. Provided that \u03a9n an + \u03a9p ap > 0\n(which is obviously true if the fluids both rotate in the positive direction) we easily show that\n\n\u2022 if we let [\u03a9n , \u03a9p ] \u2192 0 while \u03c9 is finite, then for co-rotating\nmodes we have \u03c3p > 0, which means that Jc > 0. In contrast, for\ncounter-rotating modes \u03c3p < 0 and Jc < 0. In both cases, we will\nget Ec > 0 which indicates that all (finite frequency) modes are\nstable.\n\u2022 if we consider a region near \u03c9 = 0 for finite rotation rates,\nthen \u03c3p = 0 implies that Jc < 0. This means that the mode is\nstable as long as \u03c3p < 0, but when \u03c3p changes sign (and the mode\nbecomes co-rotating) we will have Ec < 0 and an instability.\n\n2\n\nWe are assuming that the two fluids rotate in the same direction here. Although it is possible to construct models for counter-rotating backgrounds\nthese cases are somewhat pathological, and we do not expect them to have\nany astrophysical relevance.\n\n\u03b4~vy = 0 ,\n\n\u03c9 = m\u03a9x\n\n\u0014\n\n2\n1\u2212\nl(l + 1)\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(108)\n\nSince this implies that only one of the two displacements vectors is non-vanishing, it is straightforward to show that the canonical energy Eq. (93) reduces to\n\n(106)\n\nThese results can be summarised as\n\u03c3p (an + ap ) \u2212 1 +\n\nThe general case, in which \u03a9n 6= \u03a9p , was recently discussed by\nPrix et al. (2004). From that study we learn that, in absence of entrainment, the r-mode fluid motion must be such that only one of\nthe fluids oscillates. This means that we will have two classes of\nmodes, corresponding to\n\u03b4~vx 6= 0 ,\n\nand it is easy to see that we will have\n\nh\u03bex , i\u03c1x~vx * \u2207\u03bex i > \u2212(m + 1)\u03a9x ax\n\n6.1 The case with relative rotation\n\nEc =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\b\n\n\u03c1x |\u2202t \u03bex |2 \u2212 \u03c1x |v j \u2207j \u03beix |2\n+\u03c1x \u03bexi \u03bexj\u2217 \u2207i \u2207j (\u03a6 + \u03bc\u0303x ) dV\n\n(109)\n\nwhere we have assumed that \u03b4nx and \u03b4\u03a6 are of higher order in\nthe slow-rotation scheme (as in the single fluid case), and also used\nvxi = v i . Noticing the close resemblance of this result to the expression for the case of a barotropic single fluid, Eq. (53), we readily\ninfer that both these classes of modes will be unstable due to the\nemission of gravitational radiation.\nHowever, this result is likely of very limited relevance. Even\nthough it is expected that the two rotation rates will be slightly\ndifferent in astrophysical neutron stars, the entrainment coupling\nwill affect the r-modes significantly [as elucidated by Prix et al.\n(2004)], naturally leading to both displacements being non-zero.\nThis means that, despite being of conceptual interest, the case we\nhave discussed here is pathological.\n6.2 The co-rotating case\nIn the special case of \u03a9n = \u03a9p = \u03a9, we know\n(Andersson & Comer 2001; Comer 2002; Lee & Yoshida 2003;\nYoshida & Lee 2003b; Prix et al. 2004) that there will exist two\nclasses of r-modes. One is such that the two fluids move in phase,\nwhile the other has the two fluids counter-moving. Furthermore, for\n\n\fLagrangian perturbation theory of nonrelativistic rotating superfluid stars\nnon-stratified stars one can show that these two degrees of freedom\ndecouple. Given the relative simplicity of this case, we will focus\nour attention on it. The general case essentially follows as a linear\ncombination of the two results we present.\nWe begin by introducing the two classes of displacements\n\u03bei+ =\n\nnn \u03bein + np \u03beip\nnn + np\n\n(110)\n\nand\n\u03bei\u2212 = \u03bein \u2212 \u03beip .\n\n(111)\n\u03bein\n\n\u03beip\n\nThese are clearly such that, when\n=\nand the two fluids move\ntogether only \u03bei+ is present, while the total momentum flux vanishes when \u03bei+ = 0.\nNow consider purely axial r-mode solutions such that \u03bei\u2212 = 0.\nIn this situation the canonical energy Eq. (93) can be written as\n(since vnj = vpj = v j )\nEc \u2248\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\b\n\ni j\u2217\n\u03c1|\u2202t \u03be + |2 \u2212 \u03c1|v j \u2207j \u03bei+ |2 + \u03c1\u03be+\n\u03be + \u2207i \u2207j \u03a6\ni j\u2217\n+\u03be+\n\u03be+ [nn \u2207i \u2207j \u03bcn + np \u2207i \u2207j \u03bcp ] dV\n\n(112)\n\nwhere we (again) neglect the higher order contributions from \u03b4nx\nand \u03b4\u03a6.\nIn this expression, the last term can be rewritten using the fact\nthat we must have\n\u2207i \u03bcn = \u2207i \u03bcp \u2261 \u2207i \u03bc\n\n(113)\n\nif the two fluids rotate at the same rate, cf Eq. (64). This immediately leads to\nnn \u2207i \u2207j \u03bcn + np \u2207i \u2207j \u03bcp = n\u2207i \u2207j \u03bc\n\n(114)\n\n9\n\nn\n\nwhere xp = np is the proton fraction. Since the expression in the\nbracket has the same form as in the single fluid case, and the prefactor \u03c1n xp is positive definite, it is easy to prove that Ec < 0 also\nfor these counter-moving modes.\n6.3 Gravitational-wave emission\nAt this point it is appropriate to discuss how efficient the oscillations of a superfluid star are as a source of gravitational waves. After all, we have shown that the superfluid r-modes generally lead to\nEc < 0, and should therefore be driven unstable by radiation. The\nrelevance of the instability is then largely dependent on the rate at\nwhich the motion generates gravitational radiation.\nTo address this problem, we consider a source with weak internal gravity, and focus our attention on a single pulsation mode with\ntime-dependence exp(i\u03c9t). We also assume that the background is\nsuch that the two fluids rotate at different rates: \u03a9n and \u03a9p , respectively.\nThe gravitational-wave luminosity follows from e.g. Thorne\n(1980),\n\nX\n\u0001\ndE\n=\nNl \u03c9 2l+2 |\u03b4Dlm |2 + |\u03b4Jlm |2 ,\ndt\n\u221e\n\n(120)\n\nl=2\n\nwhere\nNl =\n\n(l + 1)(l + 2)\n4\u03c0G\n.\nc2l+1 l(l \u2212 1)[(2l + 1)!!]2\n\n(121)\n\nThe first term in the bracket of Eq. (120) represents radiation due\nto the mass multipoles. These are, quite generally, determined from\n\u03b4Dlm =\n\n(where n = nn + np ) and\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u2217 l\nT00 Ylm\nr dV\n\n(122)\n\nwhere T\u03bc\u03bd is the contribution to stress-energy tensor associated\n\b\ni j\u2217\n\u03c1 |\u2202t \u03be + |2 \u2212 |v j \u2207j \u03bei+ |2 + \u03be+\n\u03be+ \u2207i \u2207j (\u03a6 + \u03bc\u0303) dV .(115)with non-axisymmetric motion in the source. The second term in\nthe bracket of Eq. (120) corresponds to the current multipoles,\n~ identical\nwhich follow from\nClearly, this result is (provided that we identify \u03be~+ with \u03be)\nZ\nto that of the single fluid problem, Eq. (53). Hence, the instability\nB\u2217\n+\n\u03b4Jlm = (\u2212T0j )Yj,lm\ndV .\n(123)\nof pure \u03be~ modes follows from the calculation in Section 3.4. This\nEc =\n\n1\n2\n\nis not very surprising given that the degree of freedom we are considering is such that the two fluids move together.\nNext we consider the canonical energy for counter-rotating\nmodes, which are such that\nnn \u03beni + np \u03bepi = 0 .\n\n(116)\n\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a8\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd + p\u03bd \u03c7\u03bc + n\u03bd \u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03bei\u2212\n\nIn this situation only\nis present, and we have\nnp \u2212\nn\n\u03bei =\n\u03be ,\nn i\nnn\nnn\n\u03beip = \u2212 \u03bein = \u2212 \u03bei\u2212 .\nnp\nn\n\n1\nEc =\n2\n\n\u03c1n xp\n\n\b\n\n|\u2202t \u03bei\u2212 |2\n\n+ |v\n\nj\n\n[which is easily done using formulas given in Appendix A of\nAndersson & Comer (2001)], one can show that\n\n(118)\n\nT00 \u2248 (\u03c1n + \u03c1p )\n\n\u2207j \u03bei\u2212 |2\n\ni j\u2217\n+\u03be\u2212\n\u03be\u2212 \u2207i \u2207j (\u03a6 + \u03bc\u0303) dV\n\n(124)\n\n(117)\n\nIncidentally, the latter of these relations emphasizes the fact that\npure \u03be~\u2212 modes can only exist for non-stratified stars. We know\nfrom the results of Prix et al. (2004) that \u03bein and \u03beip will have the\nsame functional dependence on the radial coordinate r. This means\nthat, in order for both displacements to be non-zero, they must be\nproportional. This is clearly only possible if nn /np is constant.\nUsing the above relations in the expression for the canonical\nenergy Eq. (93), one can show that\n\nZ\n\nB\n~lm\nwhere Y\n\u221d r\u0302 \u00d7 \u2207Ylm are the magnetic multipoles (Thorne\n1980).\nBy taking the Newtonian limit of the relativistic stress-energy\ntensor (see, for example, Comer (2002))\n\nand\nT0j \u2248 \u03c1n~vn + \u03c1p~vp\n\n(126)\n\nfor a Newtonian source.

However, as we stated earlier, if we could\nnot make progress in the case of vanishing entrainment it would\nbe pointless to proceed to the general case. Naturally, we are encouraged by the progress we have made, which provides crucial\nbenchmarks for the onset of instability in multi-fluid systems. In\nthe near future, we will aim to generalize our results to include entrainment. This is absolutely essential for the study of gravitationalwave driven instabilities, since the primary superfluid damping\nmechanism is the mutual friction which depends crucially on the\nentrainment. The inclusion of entrainment will also be important\nfor future studies of the superfluid two-stream instability, since entrainment may be the dominant coupling to drive the instability in\nthe interiors of neutron stars.\n\n(133)\n\nWhen written in this form, the formulas closely resemble the standard single-fluid results. The only new feature is the last term in the\nbracket of Eq. (133).\nAn interesting question concerns whether it is possible to have\noscillations in a superfluid star that (at least at this post-Newtonian\nlevel) do not radiate gravitationally. From the above equations we\nimmediately deduce that in the case of a non-rotating star (with\n\u03a9n = \u03a9p = 0) or a co-rotating star (when \u03a9n = \u03a9p ) we must\nhave \u03b4\u03c1 = \u03b4~v + = 0 in order not to have any gravitational radiation\nemission. This result is quite intuitive since, as discussed in the previous section, the co-moving degree of freedom represents the total\nmomentum flux. It is not surprising to find that motion which corresponds to zero momentum flux does not radiate gravitationally.\nHowever, when combined with the results obtained from our\nsuperfluid canonical energy, these results illustrate some of the\ncomplexities associated with a discussion of gravitational-wave\ndriven instabilities in a superfluid star. In particular, we conclude that even though they are formally unstable (Ec < 0) any\npurely counter-moving modes (for which \u03be~+ = 0) will not grow\n(dE/dt = 0).\n\n7 CONCLUDING REMARKS\nWith this paper we have taken the first steps towards a Lagrangian\nperturbation framework for rotating non-relativistic superfluids.\nThe primary motivation for this work, and the key application concerns the stability properties of rotating superfluid neutron stars.\nOur analysis generalises the classic work of Friedman & Schutz\n(1978a,b) to the case of stars which require a multi-fluid description. We have applied our framework to the problem of dynamical and secular instabilities of a simplified superfluid neutron star\nmodel in which the two fluids are allowed to have different uniform\nrotation rates around the same axis, and where the entrainment effect is neglected. We have demonstrated that the criterion for the\nonset of radiation driven instabilities for modes that have a finite\nfrequency as the background rotation vanishes remains unchanged\nfrom the ordinary fluid case. We have also considered the superfluid analogue of the r-mode instability, and found that both co- and\ncounter-moving superfluid r-modes have negative canonical energy\nand will therefore be driven unstable by gravitational-wave emission.\n\nWe thank John Friedman for reading a draft version of the\nmanuscript and providing useful comments that improved the presentation.
