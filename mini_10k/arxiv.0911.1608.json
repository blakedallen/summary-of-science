The star showed semi-regular light variations with varying amplitudes. The maximal\namplitude did not exceed: \u2206V =0.m 5, \u2206B=0.m 7 and \u2206U =1.m 0. For 2000-2008, we have found\na photometric period near 128 days.

From our U BV data,\nwe derive E(B \u2212 V )=0.5 and conclude that the spectral type of the star varies between K1 to K7\nduring pulsations. The mean U BV -data of V354 Lac have not changed during the past 19 years:\nV = 8.m 60, B \u2212 V = 2.m 06 and U \u2212 B = 2.m 14.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe IR source IRAS 22272+5435 is identified with the bright star BD+54\u25e6 2787=HD\n235858 (22h 29m 10s +54\u25e6 51\u203206\u2032\u2032 (2000)). It is one of the most reliable protoplanetary nebula\ncandidates.\nThe spectral energy distribution of IRAS 22272+5435 show a characteristic double\npeak, with about the same amounts of energy emitted in the visible plus near-infrared\n(from the reddened photosphere) and in the mid-infrared (re-emission from circumstellar\ndust) (Hrivnak and Kwok 1991).\nThe chemical composition of IRAS 22272+5435 is typical of carbon post-AGB stars.\nZa\u010ds, Klochkova and Panchuk (1995) found the star to be iron poor: [Fe/H]=\u20130.49. The\nelements of the \u03b1-process are overabundant relative to the solar compositions and the\ncarbon abundance is C/O\u224812. In the spectra of IRAS 22272+5435 strong molecular\nbands of C3 and C2 are found (Hrivnak and Kwok 1991).\nIn the survey of protoplanetary nebulae candidates with Hubble Space Telescope, Ueta\net al. (2000) discovered an elongated low-surface-brightness reflection nebulosity around\nIRAS 22272+5435. These authors believe that the multilobed nebula may be a progenitor\nof a complex planetary nebula.\nThe spectral classification of V354 Lac is a difficult problem because of its peculiar\nspectrum. In the HD catalog, HD 235858 has the spectral type K5. McCuskey (1955)\nclassified the object as M0III and Hrivnak and Kwok (1991), as GpIa. The atmospheric\nparameters of IRAS 22272+5435, Tef f =5600 K and log g=0.5, correspond to a G2 supergiant (Za\u010ds, Klochkova and Panchuk, 1995).\nThe brightness variability of BD+54\u25e6 2787 was discovered by Strohmeier and Knigge\n(1960). They list it as a possible short-period variable with an amplitude of 0.m 5. Filatov (1961) reported irregular variability of the star with an amplitude of 1.m 5-2m .0.\nIn the 62nd GCVS Name-List (Kukarkin et al., 1977), BD+54\u25e6 2787 got the designation\nV354 Lac. The GCVS variability currently listed for the star is LB (a slow irregular\nvariable).\nThe light-curve and radial-velocity studies of V354 Lac were carried out by Hrivnak\nand Lu (2000) respectively in 1994-1996 and 1991-1995. They found brightness and\nradial-velocity variability with the period P =127d.\n\n\f2\n\nThe radial-velocity monitoring of V354 Lac performed by Za\u010ds et al. (2009) confirmed\nregular variations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 10 km s\u22121 and a period of\nabout 131.2 days.\nUBV OBSERVATIONS OF V354 Lac\nOur UBV photometry of IRAS 22272+5435 was performed in 1990-2008 with the 0.6-m\ntelescope of the Crimean Station of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute. The measurements were obtained using a pulse-counting photometer with an EMI 9789 photomultiplier, and a filter set consistent with the Johnson system. All observations were made\nwith respect of the comparison star BD+54\u25e6 2793 (V = 8.m 54, B = 10.m 45, U = 12.m 79).\nThe typical photometric uncertainties range from 0.m 01 in the V band and to 0.m 05 in the\nU-band. The observations obtained in 1990-1999 were published earlier (Arkhipova et al.,\n1993 and Arkhipova et al., 2000). The light and color curves of V354 Lac for 1990-2008\nare presented in Fig.1.\n\nFigure 1. The light and color curves of V354 Lac in 1990-2008.\n\nDuring our observations, V354 Lac showed semi-regular brightness variations with\nvarying amplitudes. Its largest amplitudes do not exceed \u2206V =0.m 5, \u2206B=0.m 7, \u2206U=1.m 0.\nWe searched for periodicity in the observations obtained in 1990-2008 using the DFT\n(Discrete Fourier Transforms) package by Dr. V.M.Lyuty.\nIn the power spectrum (Fig.2), triplet frequencies are dominating: \u03bd1 =0.00781, \u03bd2 =0.00763,\n\u03bd3 =0.00800. The ratios \u03bd1 /\u03bd2 and \u03bd3 /\u03bd1 are close to 1.024. The periods P1 =1/\u03bd1 =128d\nand P2 =1/\u03bd2 =131d have approximately the same amplitudes, about 0.m 18 in the V band.\nA single period, P = 128 \u00b1 2 days, was found in the observations of 2000-2008. The\ncorresponding power spectra and the V -band phased light curve are shown in Fig.3.\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 2. The power spectrum of V354 Lac for observations of 1990-2008.\n\nFigure 3. The power spectrum (top panel) and the phased V light curve (bottom panel) of V354 Lac\nfor observations of 2000-2008.\n\nConsidering the radial-velocity variations (Za\u010ds et al., 2009) together with our light\ncurve (Fig.4) confirms the conclusion of Hrivnak and Lu (2000) that V354 Lac \"is brightest\nwhen it is at its average size and expanding and faintest when at its average size and\ncontracting\". Hrivnak and Lu interpreted this variability as due to pulsation in the star\nrather than its binary nature.\nThe V -(B \u2212 V ) diagram shows a clear correlation: the star is generally bluer when\nbrighter (Fig.5).\nV354 Lac is located at a low galactic latitude (b = \u22122.\u25e6 52). The interstellar extinction\nin the direction of V354 Lac from maps of Neckel and Klare (1980) is 1.m 2 < AV < 1.m 9\nat r=1 kpc. From UBV data, we conclude that E(B \u2212 V )=0.5 and AV = 1.m 55. Thus,\npractically all the color excess can be caused by interstellar extinction.\nIn the (U \u2212B)-(B \u2212V ) two-color diagram (Fig.6), the star moves along the sequence of\nsupergiants in the course of its fluctuations. Correction of the color indices for reddening\nwith E(B \u2212 V )=0.5 put the star on the sequence of supergiants, where the spectral type\nof the star varies during pulsations from K1 to K7.\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 4. The radial-velocity variations of V354 Lac (black filled circles) with a sinusoid fit (P =131.2\ndays; black line) and V light curve (red filled circles) with a sinusoid fit (P =128 days; red line).\n\nFigure 5. The color-brightness diagram for V354 Lac.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur long-term UBV photometry of the post-AGB star V354 Lac permitted to study\nits variability character. V354 Lac showed semi-regular light variations with varying amplitudes. The maximal amplitudes did not exceed: \u2206V =0.m 5, \u2206B=0.m 7, \u2206U=1.m 0. The\nobserved behavior of V354 Lac is explained with beating of two closely spaced pulsation\nmodes with the period ratio 1.02. The other post-AGB stars with amplitude modulation\nare IRAS 19386+0155=V1648 Aql (Arkhipova et al., 2009) and IRAS 08544-4431 (Kiss et\nal., 2007). The period ratio for them is 1.04. Some pulsating red variables on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) show pulsations with two close periods. Such a phenomenon is\ndetected, for example, for RX UMa and RY Leo (Kiss et al., 2000). The authors of the\ncited paper assumed that the period ratios assumed that the period ratios found for these\nstars (1.03-1.10) suggested either high-order overtone or radial+non-radial oscillation.\nThe mean UBV parameters of V354 Lac has not changed during the past 19 years:\nV = 8.m 60, (B \u2212 V ) = 2.m 06 and (U \u2212 B) = 2.m 14.\nThe brightness and the colors change in phase: the star is generally bluer when brighter.\nThe temperature variations during pulsations correspond to the changes of the spectral\ntype from K1 to K7.\nAcknowledgements: The study was partly supported by the Council for the Program\nof Support for Leading Scientific Schools (projects NSh.433.2008.2).\n\n\f5\n\nFigure 6.
