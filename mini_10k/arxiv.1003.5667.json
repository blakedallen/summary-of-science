It has been successfully applied to describe\nsystems spanning many energy scales ranging from electrons in a metal to atomic nuclei and quark-gluon plasmas. In a recent experiment on ultracold gases, quasiparticle physics has been analyzed in depth by studying the\nproperties of a few impurities immersed in a Fermi sea\n(FS) [3]. Theoretically, one has presently a good understanding of the weak coupling limit of this problem where\nthe ground state is a screened impurity, a state which is\nreferred to as a polaron, and of the strong coupling limit\nwhere the ground state consists of a molecule formed by\nthe impurity and a particle in the FS [4, 5]. In the intermediate regime, the ground state changes from a polaron\nto a molecule as the interaction is increased, but the nature of this transition which involves a reorganization of\nthe FS is not clear at present. The polaron-molecule\ntransition is closely related to the problem of mixtures of\ndilute protons in neutrons at subnuclear density, which\nare encountered for example in stellar collapse. The protons may form either polarons or two-body bound states\n(deuterons) with the majority neutrons, in analogy with\nwhat is considered in the present paper.\nWe address here the polaron-molecule transition using a diagrammatic expansion in the number of holes\nin the FS. The coupling between the polaron and the\nmolecule is shown to scale with their energy difference\n\u2206\u03c9 as |\u2206\u03c9|9/2 . The high power is a result of phase space\neffects and Fermi statistics. It should be compared with\nthe usual \u2206\u03c9 2 scaling of the quasiparticle damping rate\nin a Fermi liquid [2]. This scaling implies long lifetimes\nand a first order transition between the polaron and the\nmolecule. Our analytical insights are confirmed by numerical calculations, and in the conclusions we discuss\nhow the decay can be measured.\n\n\u03c9P>\u03c9M\n\na)\n\np=0\n(N)\u2191\n\n\u0393P\n\nq'\n\nk\nq\n\np=q+q'-k\n\nb)\n\n\u03c9M>\u03c9P\n\nk\nq\n\np=0\n(N-1)\u2191\n\n\u0393M\np=q-k-k'\n\nk'\n\nFIG. 1. Polaron to molecule (a) and molecule to polaron (b)\ndecay processes in presence of a fully-polarized Fermi sea.\n\nWe consider a single \u2193 impurity (which may be bosonic\nor fermionic) with mass m\u2193 immersed in a FS of \u2191\nfermions with mass m\u2191 and density n\u2191 = kF3 /6\u03c0 2 . The\ninteraction between the \u2193 and \u2191 particles is short-ranged\nand described by the scattering length a, whereas the\ninteractions between identical fermions can be ignored.\nVarious approaches locate the polaron-molecule transition at the critical coupling 1/kF ac \u223c 0.9 for m\u2191 =\nm\u2193 [4, 6\u20138]. In the strong coupling regime 1/kF a >\n1/kF ac , a polaron with energy \u03c9P (we take ~ = 1) is unstable and will decay into a molecule with energy \u03c9M by\nremoving a particle from the FS. Due to the conservation\nof both momentum and energy, the decay must involve\nthe creation of an additional particle-hole pair [4]. The\nleading decay channel is therefore the three-body process\nillustrated in Fig. 1 (a). Likewise for 1/kF a < 1/kF ac ,\nthe molecule decays into a polaron by adding a fermion\nto the FS and creating an additional particle-hole excitation. This is again a three-body process as illustrated\nin Fig. 1 (b).\nA polaron with momentum p is described by the imaginary time propagator G\u2193 (p, \u03c4 ) = \u2212hT\u03c4 [\u00e2p\u2193 (\u03c4 )\u00e2\u2020p\u2193 (0)]i.\nHere, \u00e2\u2020p\u2193 creates a \u2193 particle with momentum p, T\u03c4 denotes time ordering with respect to \u03c4 \u2208 [0; 1/T [ with T\nthe temperature (we take kB = 1) and h. . .i the thermal\n\n\f2\n(a)\n\n(a)\n(1)\nP\n\n=\n\nT2\n\nT2\n\n=\n\n+\n\nD0\n\n=\n\nT2\n\n+\n\nT2\n(b)\n\n(b)\nM\n\n(2)\nP\n\n=\n\nT2\n\nT2\n\nT2\n\n+\n\n(1)\n\naverage. Its Fourier transform reads\nG\u2193 (p, z)\n\n=\n\nG0\u2193 (p, z)\u22121\n\n\u2212 \u03a3P (p, z)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere G0\u2193 (p, z) = 1/(z \u2212 \u03bep\u2193 ), \u03bep\u03c3 = p2 /2m\u03c3 \u2212 \u03bc\u03c3 , and\n\u03bc\u03c3 is the chemical potential for \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193 species. We take\nthe ideal gas value \u03bc\u2191 = \u000fF = kF2 /2m\u2191 whereas \u03bc\u2193 plays\nno role as there is no macroscopic population of the \u2193\nstates. The self energy \u03a3P describes the effects of interactions. To obtain a systematic description of the decay,\nwe expand the self energy as\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03a3P (p, z) = \u03a3P (p, z) + \u03a3P (p, z) + . . . .\n\n(2)\n\n(n)\n\nHere, \u03a3P involves processes with n holes in the FS.\n(1)\nThe term \u03a3P shown in Fig. 2 (a) corresponds to the\ncommonly used ladder approximation. The energy of a\nzero-momentum polaron obtained from\n(1)\n\n\u03c9P = \u03a3P (p = 0, \u03c9P + i0+ )\n\n(3)\n\n(we drop the infinitesimal i0+ in the following) is essentially indistinguishable from the Monte-Carlo result [4, 9\u2013\n12]. However, (3) yields a real energy for any coupling strength. To obtain the damping in the metastable\nregime it is therefore necessary to include processes involving creation of at least two holes.\n(2)\nThe Feynman diagrams for \u03a3P corresponding to the\ndecay process in Fig. 1 (a) are given in Fig. 2 (b). They\ndescribe the scattering of a p = 0 polaron creating two\nholes with momenta q and q0 , and leaving one fermion\nabove the FS with momentum k. The remaining \u2191\u2193 pair\ncan then form a molecule with momentum q + q0 \u2212 k.\nThe propagator of the open-channel, Feshbach\nmolecule is D(q, \u03c4 ) = \u2212hT\u03c4 [b\u0302p (\u03c4 )b\u0302\u2020p (0)]i with b\u0302\u2020p =\nR 3\nd q\u030c\u03c6q \u00e2\u2020p/2+q\u2193 \u00e2\u2020p/2\u2212q\u2191 and d3 q\u030c = d3 q/(2\u03c0)3 . Ignoring\nfinite \u221a\nrange effects, its wave function in vacuum reads\n\u03c6q = 8\u03c0a3 /(1 + q 2 a2 ). The Fourier transform of the\nmolecule propagator can be written as\nD(p, z)\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n= D0 (p, z)\n\n\u2212 \u03a3M (p, z)\n\nT2\n\nT2\n\n+\n\nT2\n\nT2\n\nT2\n\nFIG. 2.

It is illustrated in Fig. 3 (a). Here\nf (x) = [exp(x/T ) + 1]\u22121 is the Fermi function and\nZ\n1\n1 \u2212 f (\u03bep\u2212q\u2191 )\n= d3 q\u030c\u03c6q\n.\n(6)\ng(p, z)\nz \u2212 \u03bep\u2212q\u2191 \u2212 \u03beq\u2193\nis the atom-molecule coupling. The object entering the\ndiagrammatic analysis is g(p, z)2 D(p, z), which describes\nthe scattering of \u2191\u2193 atoms mediated by the Feshbach\nmolecule [13].pIn the following we use the vacuum limit\nof (6), g = \u2212 2\u03c0/m2r a with mr = m\u2191 m\u2193 /(m\u2193 + m\u2191 ).\nUsing the fact that there is no macroscopic population\nof the \u2193 state and that the \u2191 fermions form an ideal gas,\nthe frequency sums in the two diagrams can be performed\nanalytically by contour integration. This amounts to\nevaluating frequencies at the on-shell \u2191 energies. The po(2)\nlaron decay rate is given by \u0393P = \u2212Im\u03a3P (0, \u03c9P ). When\n0 < \u2206\u03c9 = \u03c9P \u2212 \u03c9M \u001c \u000fF , the G0\u2193 's and T2 's in Fig. 2 (b)\nare off resonant and therefore real. The only contribution to the imaginary part giving rise to damping comes\nfrom the Feshbach molecule, which in the vicinity of its\npole can be described by\nD(p, \u03c9) '\n\nZM\n.\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9M \u2212 p2 /2m\u2217M\n\n(7)\n\nHere, ZM and m\u2217M are the molecule residue and effective\nmass respectively. The contribution to \u0393P from the two\ndiagrams in Fig. 2 (b) at T = 0 can after some algebra\nbe written in the symmetric form\nZ\ng 2 ZM\n2\nd3 q\u030cd3 \u01e9d3 q\u030c 0 [F (q, k, \u03c9P ) \u2212 F (q0 , k, \u03c9P )]\n\u0393P =\n2\n\u0001\n\u00d7\u03b4 \u2206\u03c9 + \u03beq\u2191 + \u03beq0 \u2191 \u2212 \u03bek\u2191 \u2212 (q + q0 \u2212 k)2 /2m\u2217M . (8)\nWe have defined F (q, k, \u03c9) = T2 (q, \u03c9 + \u03beq\u2191 )G0\u2193 (q \u2212 k, \u03c9 +\n\u03beq\u2191 \u2212 \u03bek\u2191 ). Here and in the following, we take q, q 0 < kF\n\n\f3\n\n25/2\n=\n(m\u2217 )3/2 \u2206\u03c9 7/2 .\n105\u03c0 2 M\n\n(9)\n\nThus, the available phase space of the three-body process\ngives a factor \u2206\u03c9 7/2 for the decay rate: the \u03b4-function\nremoves one energy integral in (9), a factor \u2206\u03c9 comes\nfrom each of the two remaining degenerate energies, and\na factor \u2206\u03c9 3/2 comes from the molecule. Let us now\nfocus on the matrix element F (q, k, \u03c9P ) \u2212 F (q0 , k, \u03c9P )\nin (8). The momenta q, q0 , and k form an equilateral\ntriangle for \u2206\u03c9 = 0 and the matrix element vanishes,\nsince F (q, k, \u03c9) only depends on the angle between q\nand k. For \u2206\u03c9 \u001c \u000fF , we can expand the matrix element\nin the deviations of the triangle formed by q, q0 , and k\naway from the equilateral shape. Using this in (8) yields\n\n\u0393M/(ZP \u03b5F)\n\n1\n\n\u0393P/(ZM \u03b5F),\n\nand k > kF . The summation over two holes and one\nparticle in (8) can be interpreted as a reorganization of\nthe FS to contain one less particle.\nFor \u2206\u03c9 \u001c \u000fF , the holes and particles involved in\nthe scattering process illustrated in Fig. 1(a) are located\naround the Fermi surface, i.e. q ' k ' k 0 ' kF . Also,\nthe molecule momentum is small since p2 /2m\u2217M < \u2206\u03c9.\nUsing this and ignoring for the time being the matrix\nelement in (8), we get the integral\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ \u221e Z 0\np2\nd3 p\u030c\nd\u03be\nd\u03be 0 d\u03be 00 \u03b4 \u2206\u03c9 + \u03be 0 + \u03be 00 \u2212 \u03be \u2212\n2m\u2217M\n0\n\u2212\u000fF\n\n0.25\n0\n\n\u2206\u03c9/\u03b5F\n\n10-2\n0.5\n\n-0.25\n\n1 1.5\n1/(kFa)\n\n2\n\n10-4\n\n10-6\n0.05\n\n\u0393P\n\u0393M\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u0393P \u223c ZM kF a\n\n\u2206\u03c9\n\u000fF\n\nHere, C(q, k, \u03c9) = G0\u2193 (k, \u03c9 \u2212 \u03bek\u2191 )T2 (k \u2212 q, \u03c9 \u2212 \u03bek\u2191 + \u03beq\u2191 )\nand ZP is the polaron residue. Like for the polaron decay,\none can derive from (11) that\n\u0393M \u223c ZP kF a\n\n\u00139/2\n\u000fF .\n\n(10)\n\nThus, the Fermi antisymmetry when swapping the hole\nmomenta q and q0 gives an additional factor \u2206\u03c9 to the\ndecay rate. The resulting polaron lifetime 1/2\u0393P diverges\nmuch faster than 1/\u2206\u03c9 close to the transition point kF ac .\nFrom (10) it follows that the matrix element between\nequal energy states which contain a molecule or a polaron\nvanishes at the transition point. This means that there is\nno avoided crossing and that the transition between the\ntwo states is of first order, as was suggested previously [4].\nConsider now the regime \u2206\u03c9 < 0 (1/kF a < 1/kF ac ).\nHere the molecule decays into a polaron via the threebody process illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The corresponding\nFeynman diagrams are shown in 3(b). After the molecule\nhas split, the impurity scatters with the FS leaving one\nhole with momentum q and two particles with momenta\nk and k0 . The impurity can then form a polaron with\nmomentum p = q \u2212 k \u2212 k0 . The decay rate for a zero\nmomentum molecule is given by \u0393M = \u2212Im\u03a3M (0, \u03c9M ),\nand calculations like the ones for the polaron show that\nfor T = 0 and |\u2206\u03c9| \u001c \u000fF the two diagrams give\nZ\ng 2 ZP\n2\n\u0393M =\nd3 \u01e9d3 \u01e9 0 d3 q\u030c [C(q, k, \u03c9M ) \u2212 C(q, k0 , \u03c9M )]\n2\n\u0001\n\u00d7\u03b4 |\u2206\u03c9| + \u03beq\u2191 \u2212 \u03bek\u2191 \u2212 \u03bek0 \u2191 \u2212 (q \u2212 k \u2212 k0 )2 /2m\u2217P .\n(11)\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 4.

Again, this means that the molecule is\nlong lived close to the cross-over.\nIn Fig. (4) we show calculations of the decay rates obtained from Eqs. (8) and (11) for the m\u2191 = m\u2193 case. In\nthe numerics we have used\n2\u03c0a/mr\np\n,\n2\n2\n1 \u2212 2mr a (p /2mM \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 \u000fF + g3 n\u2191 )\n(13)\nwhich describes molecules with energy\nT2 (p, \u03c9) =\n\n\u03c9M = \u2212~2 /(2mr a2 ) \u2212 \u000fF + g3 n\u2191 .\n\n(14)\n\nHere g3 = 2\u03c0~2 a3 /m3 , m3 = m\u2191 (m\u2191 + m\u2193 )(2m\u2191 +\nm\u2193 ), and a3 = 1.18a is the molecule-atom scattering\nlength [14, 15]. Equation (14) is exact in the limit\n1/kF a \u2192 \u221e, and accurate all the way to the critical\ncoupling 1/kF ac for the case m\u2191 = m\u2193 [4]. The polaron energy is obtained from (3), while m\u2217P and m\u2217M are\ntaken from Ref. [4]. The numerical results shown in Fig. 4\nmatch nicely with (10) and (12) for |\u2206\u03c9| \u001c \u000fF . In the\nfits, we have taken into account the factors (m\u2217P )3/2 and\n(m\u2217M )3/2 coming from the \u03b4-functions [see (9)]. For larger\n|\u2206\u03c9|, there is as expected some discrepancy between the\nnumerical results and (10) and (12) since the momenta\ninvolved in the scattering processes are no longer close to\nthe Fermi surface.\n\n\f4\nOur analysis shows that the decay of polarons and\nmolecules will happen on timescales of order 10 \u2212 100ms.\nTo observe the decay, one could for instance sweep\nthe scattering length across ac . Zener type of arguments predict that the polarons/molecules will survive as\nmetastable states after the sweep [16]. Radio-frequency\nspectroscopy [3] or optical probes can then be used\nto map the exponential decrease in time of the polaron/molecule population. Alternatively, one can extract the effective mass from collective mode frequencies [17]. This technique has been successfully applied at\nunitarity [18]. By measuring the change in the frequency\nas a function of time, one may extract the decay rate of\nthe metastable state.\nThe polaron can decay to deeply bound closed channel molecules via three-body processes analogous to the\nones considered here for the decay into the weakly bound\nFeshbach molecule. This decay is however strongly suppressed because the deeply bound molecules are spatially\nmuch smaller than the Feshbach molecule, whose size is\n\u223c a. Since the decay requires two \u2191 fermions to be at\ndistance of order of the molecule size, the Pauli principle\nsuppresses decay into deep molecular states much more\nefficiently than into the larger Feshbach state [19]. The\nFeshbach molecule furthermore has a large component\nin the open channel for broad resonances, which justifies\nour use of a single channel theory in the present paper.\nContrary to this, the deeply bound molecules are mostly\nin the closed channel where the fermions are in different\nspin states. This should suppress the decay even further\nas it must involve spin flips. Indeed, no decay to deeply\nbound states has been observed for a strongly polarized\nFermi gas [3], and very long lifetimes of order tens of seconds have been measured for balanced two component\nFermi gases [20]. Contrary to this, our results show that\nthe decay into the weakly bound Feshbach molecule is in\nthe 10-100ms range, confirming that it is the dominant\nloss process.\nOne can include more interaction effects in the decay\nfor instance by replacing G0\u2193 with G\u2193 in the matrix elements or by introducing additional scattering events.\nThis will change the quantitative value of the matrix elements for the scattering processes but will not change\nthe \u0393 \u223c |\u2206\u03c9|9/2 scaling as this comes from the combined\neffects of kinematics and Fermi statistics; it can in fact\nbe obtained from a Golden Rule calculation.\nFor m\u2191 = m\u2193 and T = 0, Monte-Carlo calculations\npredict at small impurity densities a phase separated\nstate before polarons may decay into molecules [12]. We\nexpect however that non-zero temperatures will stabilize\nthe polaron state against phase separation due to the entropy of mixing. Moreover, the boundary between mixed\nand separated states depends on the ratio m\u2193 /m\u2191 [21].\nBy appropriately selecting the atomic species, one may\nbring the critical crossing point back to a physically observable region. Alternatively, one could use bosonic im-\n\npurities, for which stability against phase separation has\nrecently been predicted [22]. It would therefore be interesting to extend experiments with large population\nimbalances to mass-imbalanced fermionic mixtures, or to\nBose-Fermi mixtures.\nIn conclusion, we have considered the leading threebody processes involved in the polaron-molecule coupling. Our analysis shows that the coupling is strongly\nsuppressed due to a combination of phase-space and\nPauli blocking effects, vanishing as a power law close\nto the transition. This yields very long lifetimes of the\nmetastable states, and implies a first order transition between the two ground states. Our results suggest new\ndirections for experiments with polarized atomic gases.\nWe acknowledge useful discussions with C.
