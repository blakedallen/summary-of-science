J. Drescher\nJohann Wolfgang Goethe University, Postfach 11 19 32, 60054 Frankfurt, Germany\nWe discuss particle production in the high energy limit of QCD. Due to a large gluon density, the interaction\nreaches the black disk limit and the projectile is resolved into its partonic structure at the saturation scale. This\nleads to suppression of forward particle production and hereby to a faster absorption of cosmic ray air showers.\nThis property is most suitable for the distinction of evolution scenarios for the saturation scale, e.g. fixed and\nrunning coupling BFKL, the latter of which is favored by air shower measurements.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe biggest uncertainty in air shower simulations is certainly the hadronic interaction model,\nsince QCD is poorly understood at these high energies and accelerator data is not available.\nHigher twist corrections become increasingly\nimportant at high energies. Attempts to account\nfor this are the implementation of an energydependent pt cutoff [1] for hard scattering or the\nresummation of enhanced pomeron diagrams in\nan efficient manner [2]. This way one tries to\nextend the applicability of hadronic interaction\nmodels up to GZK energies, E \u2248 1011 GeV.\nOur approach [3] is to consider the black\ndisk limit (or black body limit - BBL) at high\ngluon densities within the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) approach[4], where the interaction\nprobability is close to unity. This leads to a suppression of forward particle scattering, the most\nimportant phase space region for cosmic ray air\nshowers.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic view of the break-up of a\nhadron: the partonic structure is resolved at the\nsaturation scale Qs\n\nHere, two different evolution scenarios are considered for the saturation scale QS : fixed coupling\n\u0010 x \u0011\u03bb\n0\n,\n(3)\nQ2s (x, A) = Q20 (A)\nx\n\n2.

Suppression of forward scattering for\ncentral p-N collisions.\n\nThe diagrammatic structure of an BBL event\nis schematically given in Fig. 1. The projectile\ninteracts with the target as a whole and loses its\ncoherence[7]. The partons are resolved at a scale\ngiven by the saturation momentum. An important feature is that soft physics is mostly suppressed, the typical transverse momentum being\nthe resolution scale Qs .\n3. Monte Carlo implementation\nSince the PDFs are resolved at the saturation scale Qs , they provide the probability distribution for a parton to appear in the final\nstate. The mean transverse momentum is approximately given by Qs :\n\u0001\n(6)\nPi (x) = fi Q2s (x), x\nhpt i \u2248\n\nQs (x)\n\n(7)\n\nNote that Qs is a function of x and b. For valence quarks we use the GRV94 parton distribution functions. For a baryon, first the three valence quarks are generated, then the remaining\nenergy is used for gluon bremsstrahlung. Here\nwe use the ansatz from Ref. [8]\nxg(x, qt2 ) \u223c\n\n\u0001\n1\nmin qt2 , Q2s (x) (1 \u2212 x)2 ,\n\u03b1s\n\n(8)\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nQGSJET\nSIBYLL\nBBL r.c.\nBBL f.c.\n\n2\n\nFigure 3.\nevents.\n\n10\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n10\nenergy [GeV]\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\nMean multiplicity of central p-N\n\nwhich exhibits no divergence for low qt . The produced gluons are ordered in rapidity and placed\non strings between the valence quarks and the\ntarget nucleus, whose precise configuration is not\nimportant, since we are interested in forward scattering. In principle, a baryon-nucleus collision\nproduces 3 strings, a meson-nucleus collision 2\nstrings. However, when the invariant mass between two of the three quarks is small, one cannot assume anymore that they fragment independently. Therefore, we implement a cut-off in invariant mass,\nmcut = m\u03c1 = 0.77 GeV\n\n(9)\n\nbelow which two leading quarks are allowed to\nform a diquark. This is an important feature since\nit recovers the leading particle effect for low Qs .\nThe hadronization of the strings is done within\nthe LUND model [9].\nOf course, even at high energies, not all minimum bias events will be near the BBL. Therefore,\nwe couple our model to a standard pQCD leading\ntwist event generator, SIBYLL 2.1 [1]. Which of\nthe two models is to be applied for a given impact\nparameter, follows from the condition\nQNucleus\n(xF = 0.001) & 1GeV .\ns\n\n(10)\n\nThe saturation momentum of the target at a longitudinal momentum fraction of x = 0.001 for the\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\nBBL fracction\n\ninelasticity K\n\n3\n\n0.6\n0.4\nQGSJET\nSIBYLL\nBBL r.c.\nBBL f.c.\n\n0.2\n0\n2\n10\n\n10\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n10\nenergy [GeV]\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0\n2\n10\n\n10\n\nprojectile must be greater than a given value. The\ntypical resolution scale for the valence quarks is\ncorrespondingly higher, since they have x \u2248 0.2.\n4. Results of the BBL event generator\nUsing the BBL as event generator, we can compare results in particle production to the pQCD\nmodel SIBYLL. At the same time, we compare\nthe two different evolution scenarios, fixed and\nrunning coupling. Fig. 2 shows a Feynman-x distribution of charged particles for central protonnitrogen collisions. One notices the absence of\nparticle production in the very forward region,\nwhich is the typical property of this approach.\nThis figure shows running coupling only; fixed\ncoupling would be even more extreme. The absence of forward scattering is compensated by a\nrelatively large multiplicity in the mid-rapidity\nregion. In Fig. 3, we show the average multiplicities for fixed and running coupling BBL, as well\nas SIBYLL and QGSJET01 [11] results. Due to\na missing ad-hoc pt cutoff, QGSJET01 exhibits\nalso a large multiplicity.\nAn interesting observable for air showers is the\ninelasticity,\nEmax\n,\nE0\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\nFigure 4.

A\nsmall value K \u2248 0 is significant for elastic or\ndiffractive events, where most of the energy remains in the leading particle. For air showers, a\nhigh inelasticity means that the shower are absorbed more rapidly in the atmosphere, giving\nrise to smaller Xmax values. Fig. 4 shows how\nthe suppression of the leading particle results in\na higher K, especially for fixed coupling.\nFinally, we show the fraction of BBL-events as\na function of primary energy in Fig. 5. It reaches\n90% at GZK energies. Note, that this does not\nmean that 90% of the cross section can be approximated as a black disk, since this also depends on\nthe Qs with which the event was created. But\nit gives some idea about how this phenomenon\nbecomes more important at high energies.\n5. Application of BBL to air showers\nWe implement the BBL event generator into\nthe Seneca air shower code [10] and compute the\nmean Xmax as a function of energy for proton\nprimaries.\nIn Figure 6 we compare the predictions of\nSIBYLL 2.1 for proton and iron induced showers to the saturation model (BBL, for proton\nprimaries only) with running and fixed coupling\n\n\f4\n850\n\n2\n\nXmax [g/cm ]\n\n800\n\nREFERENCES\n\nSibyll (p,Fe)\nBBL r.c.

In the saturation\nlimit, showers do not penetrate as deeply into the\natmosphere. This is due to the \"break-up\" of the\nprojectile's coherence [7] together with the suppression of forward parton scattering (for central\ncollisions). The comparison to the data might\nsuggest a preferably light composition, but the\nuncertainties at these energies are still considerable.\n6. Conclusions\nWe developed an hadronic interaction model\nconsidering the black disk limit in high density\nQCD. The suppression of forward scattering results in faster absorption of particles within air\nshowers, which leads to a smaller Xmax . This\nfeature allows one to distinguish between possible\nevolution scenarios for the saturation momentum.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was done in collaboration with\nA. Dumitru and M.
