Non-spherical models\nare generally cumbersome to compute numerically in MOND, but we present here a class of\nanalytic non-spherical models that can be applied to fit double-imaged and quadruple-imaged\nsystems. We use them to obtain a reasonable MOND fit to ten double-imaged systems, as well\nas to the quadruple-imaged system Q2237+030 which is an isolated bulge-disc lens producing\nan Einstein cross. However, we also find five double-imaged systems and three quadrupleimaged systems for which no reasonable MOND fit can be obtained with our models. We\nargue that this is mostly due to the intrinsic limitation of the analytic models, even though\nthe presence of small amounts of additional dark mass on galaxy scales in MOND is also\nplausible.\nKey words: gravitational lensing - cosmology: theory - dark matter\n\nThe MOdified Newtonian Dynamics paradigm (MOND, Milgrom\n1983) has been originally proposed as an alternative to galactic\ncold dark matter (CDM). This paradigm postulates a modification\nof Newton's laws in order to explain the rotation curves of spiral\ngalaxies, by saying that the MONDian gravitational accelerations\ngM \u226a a0 \u2248 10\u221210 m s\u22122 approach (gN a0 )1/2 where gN is the usual\nNewtonian gravitational acceleration. Nowadays, this paradigm is\nstill better suited than dark matter to explain the observed conspiracy between the distribution of baryons and the gravitational field\nin spiral galaxies (e.g., McGaugh et al. 2007; Famaey et al. 2007).\nIndeed, it is baffling that such a simple prescription leads to uncannily successful predictions for galaxies ranging over five decades\nin mass (see, e.g., Sanders & McGaugh 2002; Bekenstein 2006 for\nreviews), including our own Milky Way (Famaey & Binney 2005;\nFamaey et al. 2007).\nOn the other hand, recent developments in the theory of\ngravity have also added plausibility to the case for MOND\nthrough the advent of Lorentz-covariant theories yielding this behavior in the ultra-weak gravity limit by means of a dynamical (not necessarily) normalized four-vector field (Bekenstein\n2004; Zlosnik et al. 2007; Bruneton & Esposito-Far\u00e8se 2007; Zhao\n2007; Sanders 2005; Skordis 2008). Although rather fine-tuned\n\nand still being a far cry from a fundamental theory underpinning the MOND paradigm, these new theories remarkably allow for new predictions regarding cosmology (e.g., Skordis et al.\n2006; Dodelson & Liguori 2006; Schmidt et al. 2007; Zhang et al.\n2007) and gravitational lensing (e.g., Chiu et al. 2006; Qin et al.\n1995; Zhao et al. 2006; Angus et al. 2007; Famaey et al. 2007;\nTakahashi & Chiba 2007; Feix et al. 2008).\nIn these Lorentz-covariant theories, gravitational lensing has\nactually been shown to work exactly in the same manner as in\nGeneral Relativity (GR) for static systems (e.g., Bekenstein 2004),\nexcept for the relation between the density and the gravitational\npotential. This allowed, for instance, Zhao et al. (2006) to test\nMOND against the CfA-Arizona Space Telescope Lens Survey\n(CASTLES) data of image-splitting lenses, building on the earlier\nwork of Qin et al.(1995; also see Ferreras et al. 2008). They were\nnevertheless restricted to models of spherical geometry, and were\nthus only able to account for the size of the Einstein ring of observed lenses, but not for the exact position of collinear images in\ndouble-imaged systems, and of course not for quadruple-imaged\nsystems. This intrinsic limitation is due to the fact that the MON~ N,\nDian acceleration ~gM is related to the Newtonian one, ~gN = \u2212\u2207\u03a6\nby (Bekenstein & Milgrom 1984)\n!\n|~gM |\n~ N + S~ ,\n\u03bc\n~gM = \u2212\u2207\u03a6\n(1)\na0\n\n\u22c6\n\nwhere S~ is a solenoidal vector field determined by the condition\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\nE-mail: shanhuany@bao.ac.cn (HYS); mf256@st-andrews.ac.uk (MF)\n\n\f2\n\nHuanYuan Shan, Martin Feix, Benoit Famaey and HongSheng Zhao\n\nthat ~gM can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential \u03a6 M .\nThe function \u03bc, controlling the modification of Newton's law, has\nthe following asymptotic behavior:\n\u03bc(x) \u223c x\n\n\u03c1HK =\n\nx \u226a 1,\n\n\u03bc(x) \u223c 1\n\nUsing Poisson's equation, we find that the underlying density\ndistribution is given by (R2 = x2 + y2 )\n\n(2)\n\nx \u226b 1.\n\nThe field S~ is typically non-zero in non-spherical geometry, and\ncalculating it usually requires the use of a numerical solver for\nthe non-linear field equation of MOND (e.g., Ciotti et al. 2006;\nTiret & Combes 2007; Feix et al. 2008).\nIn this paper, we will demonstrate how to create simple analytic models of non-spherical lenses with S~ = ~0 in MOND, choosing the covariant framework of tensor-vector-scalar gravity (TeVeS,\nBekenstein 2004). Without resorting to a numerical Poisson solver,\nthese analytic models can thus be used to fit image positions in\ndouble-imaged and quadrupled-image systems. We present our analytic models in Sect. 2, devise a fitting procedure in Sect. 3, and\nfinally expose and discuss the results in Sects. 4 and 5.\n\nMh\n\u00113 .\n\u0010p\n2\u03c0 R2 + (|z| + b)2 R2 + (|z| + b)2 + h\np\n\nThe corresponding density contours in the (R, z) plane are plotted\nin Fig. 1 for different values of h/b.\nConsidering the Hernquist-Kuzmin model for gravitational\nlensing, we choose the z-axis such that it is parallel to the lineof-sight and x,y are the Cartesian coordinates spanning the lens\nplane. Because we need to account for different possible orientations of galaxies, we additionally have to rotate the disc. Defining\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(r )2 = (x )2 + (y )2 + (|z | + b)2 , where\n\u2032\n\nx = (x cos \u03c6 \u2212 y sin \u03c6) cos \u03b8 \u2212 z sin \u03b8,\n\u2032\n\ny = x sin \u03c6 + y cos \u03c6,\nz = (x cos \u03c6 \u2212 y sin \u03c6) sin \u03b8 + z cos \u03b8,\n\nthe angle (\u03c0/2) \u2212 \u03b8 being the inclination of the galaxy's symmetry\nplane w.r.t. the line of sight and \u03c6 the galaxy's position angle (PA),\nEq. (4) turns into\n\u03a6N,HK =\n\nThe Kuzmin disc (Kuzmin 1956), defined by a Newtonian gravitational potential of the form\n\u03a6N,K = p\n\nx2\n\n+\n\n\u2212GM\n\ny2\n\n+ (|z| +\n\nb)2\n\n, b>0\n\n(3)\n\nis a well-known non-spherical case which satisfies S~ = ~0 in Eq. (1):\nFor z > 0, Eq. (3) corresponds to the Newtonian potential generated\nby a point mass located at (0, 0, \u2212b), in case of z < 0 it turns into\nthe Newtonian potential of a point mass located at (0, 0, b). Thus,\nabove and below the disc, we effectively have a spherical Newtonian potential, which implies that truly S~ = ~0 in Eq. (1).\nHereafter, the idea is simply to model lens galaxies by replacing the auxiliary point lens potential of the Kuzmin disc with an\nauxiliary Hernquist lens potential (Hernquist 1990); we shall refer to this model as the Hernquist-Kuzmin (HK) model. A similar approach, using Plummer's model and a smooth transition at\nz = 0 instead, leads to the Plummer-Kuzmin model derived by\nMiyamoto & Nagai (1975) which provides a qualitatively good fit\nto the mass profile of observed galaxies. Although our proposed\nmodel is not a very good description of real galaxies, it enables us\nto derive fully analytic lens models in the context of MOND (see\nSect. 2.2) and to study the influence of non-sphericity on the ability\nto fit image positions.\nThe Newtonian potential of the Hernquist-Kuzmin model\ntakes the form\n\u03a6N,HK = p\n\n\u2212GM\n\nx2 + y2 + (|z| + b)2 + h\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwith b being the Kuzmin parameter and h denoting the core radius of the Hernquist profile. Choosing different ratios h/b, this\nmodel will produce different Hubble type galaxies, going from a\npure Kuzmin disc galaxy for h/b \u2192 0 to a pure Hernquist sphere\nfor h/b \u2192 \u221e. To clarify this situation and to characterize the nonsphericity of the model, one may simply expand the r.h.s of Eq.

Since most of\nthe light bending still occurs within a small range around the lens\ncompared to the distances between lens and source and observer\nand source, gravitational lensing works exactly the same way as\nin GR if the Newtonian potential is substituted by the total nonrelativistic modified potential.\nThen, according to Schneider et al. (1992), the resulting deflection angle can be written as\n\u03b1\n~ =2\n\nZ\u221e\n\n~ \u22a5 \u03a6dz,\n\u2207\n\n(9)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n~ \u22a5 denotes the twowhere \u03a6 is the total gravitational potential, \u2207\ndimensional gradient operator perpendicular to light propagation\nand integration is performed along the unperturbed light path\n(Born's approximation). Positions in the source and the lens plane\nare related through the lens equation:\n~\u03b7 =\n\nDs ~\n\u03be \u2212 Dls ~\u03b1(~\u03be).\nDl\n\n(10)\n\nHere ~\u03be = (x, y), ~\u03b7 is the 2-dimensional position vector in the source\nplane, and Ds , Dl , and Dls are the (angular diameter) distances between source and observer, lens and observer, and lens and source,\nrespectively. Furthermore, it is convenient to introduce the deflection potential \u03a8(~\u03b8):\nZ\n\u03a8(~\u03b8) = 2D \u03a6(Dl~\u03b8, z)dz,\n(11)\nwhere we have used ~\u03b8 = ~\u03be/Dl and D = Dls /(Ds Dl ). If a source\nis much smaller than the angular scale on which the lens properties change, the lens mapping can locally be linearized. Thus, the\ndistortion of an image can be described by the Jacobian matrix\n!\n\u2202~\u03b2\n1 \u2212 \u03ba \u2212 \u03b31\n\u2212\u03b32\nA(~\u03b8) =\n=\n,\n(12)\n\u2212\u03b32\n1 \u2212 \u03ba + \u03b31\n\u2202~\u03b8\n\n\fAn analytic model for non-spherical lenses in covariant MOdified Newtonian Dynamics\n\n3\n\n8\n\n(0, b)\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n(R, 0)\n\nz/b\n\n-2\n-4\n\n|z|\n-6\n\n(R, \u2212|z|)\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n-8\n\nR/b\n\n(0, \u2212b)\n8\n\n30\n6\n\n20\n4\n\n10\n\n2\n0\n\nz/b\n\n0\n\n-2\n\nz/b\n\n-10\n\n-4\n\n-20\n\n-6\n\n-30\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n-8\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\nR/b\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nR/b\n\nFigure 1.

Points in the lens plane where A\u22121 = 0 form closed curves,\nthe critical curves. Their corresponding curves located in the source\nplane are called caustics. Images near critical curves can significantly be magnified and distorted, which, for instance, is indicated\nby the giant luminous arcs formed from source galaxies near caustics.\nDue to the deflection by the gravitational potential, light rays\ntraveling from a source to an observer at redshift z = 0 will be\n\ndelayed in time:\n!\n1 + zl 1 ~ ~ 2\nt(~\u03b8) =\n(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b2) \u2212 \u03a8(~\u03b8) ,\nD\n2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere zl is the lens' redshift. If the deflection potential is known,\nEq. (16) allows to calculate the relative time delay between different images.\nChoosing a certain smooth transition from Newtonian dynamics to MOND (see Zhao et al. 2006, Sect. 8.2 for details) and assuming spherical symmetry, we have the following relation for the\ntotal acceleration in TeVeS:\np\ngM (r) = gN (r) + gN (r)a0 ,\n(17)\n\nwhere a0 = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221210 ms\u22122 .

Analogously, the closed analytic form\n\n\f4\n\nHuanYuan Shan, Martin Feix, Benoit Famaey and HongSheng Zhao\n\nfor \u03b1y can be derived, and as as a consequence, this is also true for\nthe lensing quantities \u03ba and \u03b3.\n\n2.3 Cosmology and distances\nConcerning the calculation of distances in gravitational lensing,\nwe shall adopt a standard flat \u039bCDM cosmology with \u03a9m = 0.3\nand \u03a9\u039b = 0.7. This choice is justified by the fact that many covariant formulations of MOND mimic the behavior of a \u039bCDM\nmodel, accounting for marginal differences that will have no significant impact on our analysis. For instance, Zhao et al. (2006)\npresented a minimal-matter open model with a cosmological constant which works to good accuracy for redshifts z . 3. Furthermore, Angus et al. (2007) proposed the flat \u03bcHDM (MOND\nHot Dark Matter) cosmological model based on the assumption of\nmassive (sterile) neutrinos. If provided with a cosmological constant, this model is quite similar to the standard flat \u039bCDM model,\nbeing capable of explaining the cosmic microwave background\n(Skordis et al. 2006). Recent work has also shown that it seems possible to construct certain covariant formulations of MOND giving a\ncosmology identical to \u039bCDM in the matter-dominated era (Zhao\n2007).\n\ntions with an anomalous mass-to-light ratio or a large flux anomaly:\n\uf8ee\n!2 \uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\nb\nP = \uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ef(log FP)2 + (cos i)2 +\n\uf8fb\uf8fa\nb+h\n(21)\n\"\n#2\n#2 \"\nfAB\nM\n+ log obs + log\n.\nf\nMstellar\nThe deviation from the Fundamental Plane is measured by\nlog FP = log(h/h1 ) \u2212 1.26 log(M/M1 ), and h1 = 0.72kpc and\nM1 = 1.5 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 (Chen & Zhao 2006).\nWe choose a very small regularization parameter \u03bb \u223c\n(0.003\u2032\u2032 )2 , and minimize the following regularized \"\u03c72 -like\" quantity,\n\u03b72 = \u22062s + \u22062l + \u03bbP,\n\n(22)\n\nfor 14 double-imaged systems and four quadruple-imaged systems\nin CASTLES. Note that we also check that our results are insensitive to the detailed choice of the regularization parameter2 and that,\ndue to the sufficient amount of constraints (position of lens and\nimages), the fitting procedure for quadruple-image lenses is performed with \u03bb = 0. The results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2,\nrespectively. Finally, note that the observed mass of each lens was\ncalculated according to Sect. 7.1 of Zhao et al. (2006, Eqs. (73)(75)).\n\n3 FITTING PROCEDURE\nWe will follow Kayser (1990) to model the lens systems: For each\npair of images i and j, when tracing one light-ray back for each\nobserved image to the source plane, the source position obtained\nfrom Eq. (10) should be the same for both images. We can thus\nsimply compare the resulting source position for each image by\ncomputing their squared deviation,\nX\u0010\n\u0011\n(xsi \u2212 xs j )2 + (ysi \u2212 ys j )2 ,\n(19)\n\u22062s =\ni, j\n\nwhere xs and ys is the source position in Eq. (10). This is a measurement of how well the images retrace back to a single point in\nthe source plane.\nAnother quantity to minimize is the deviation of the lens centre from the observed optical centre, given by\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22062l = (xl )2 + (yl )2 ,\n(20)\n\nHowever, our model has generally nine fitting parameters (the\nlens mass M, the Kuzmin length b, the Hernquist length h, the PA\nangle, the inclination i, the source position xs , ys , and the lens position xl , yl ), while for a double-imaged system we have only four\nconstraints from the two image positions, and another two constraints from the observed lens optical centre. The problem is thus\nill-posed.\nTo cure this, and ensure the uniqueness of the solution, we use\na regularization method by adding a regularization term in the minimization. This term is penalizing solutions deviating from the Fundamental Plane as well as face-on1 and discy solutions, and solu-\n\n1\n\nAs there is strong observational evidence supporting that the system B0218+357 corresponds to a nearly face-on spiral galaxy (e.g.\nGrundahl & Hjorth 1995; York et al. 2005), we choose the regularization\nterm for this particular lens such that edge-on solutions are penalized instead. Further relaxing the penalties w.r.t. the Fundamental Plane and the\nobserved flux ratio in Eq. (21), the fit substantially improves, corresponding to a factor of 20 in \u2206 s .\n\n4 FITTING RESULTS\n4.1 Double-imaged systems\nSetting \u2206s < 0.01\u2032\u2032 as a reasonable threshold for acceptable fits of\nthe HK lens, Table 1 shows that our model is able to describe the\nobserved image positions of all double-imaged systems, with quite\na number of these systems yielding plausible parameters within the\ncontext of MOND/TeVeS. Additionally, the HK model seems to be\nable to explain the flux ratios of these binaries in almost every case.\nHowever, there are a few outliers which we will discuss in the\nfollowing. Since the model should be capable of reproducing all observational constraints and the lens mass should have a value close\nto the stellar mass (M/M\u2217 \u2243 1) in MOND/TeVeS, these are characterized by very poor fitting parameters in terms of large differences\nbetween predicted and observed flux ratios and/or anomalous mass\nratios M/M\u2217 (deviation larger than a factor of 3).\n4.1.1 RXJ0921+4529\nThe system RXJ0921+4529 contains two zs = 1.66 quasars and\na H = 18.2 spiral galaxy located in between the quasar images.\nAccording to Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2001), this galaxy lens is quite likely\nto be a member of a zl = 0.32 X-ray cluster centreed on the observed field. Clearly, RXJ0921+4529 does not correspond to an\nisolated system, which complicates the situation in TeVeS and provides a possible explanation for the extremely poor fit/mass ratio\n(M/M\u2217 \u2248 59). The presence of a cluster could have caused difficulties in fitting the lens as the impact of non-linear effects may\n2\n\nIn case of RXJ0921+4529, however, our choice of \u03bb creates an overregularization effect, which results in a best-fit lens mass that is roughly by\na factor 10 smaller than estimated by Zhao et al. (2006) fitting the system's\nEinstein ring size. Decreasing the regularization parameter to \u03bb \u223c (3 \u00d7\n10\u22124\u2032\u2032 )2 is able to resolve this issue, with \u2206 s dropping by a factor 10 and the\nlens mass now being in accordance with the previous estimate of Zhao et al.\n(2006) (see Table 1).\n\n\fAn analytic model for non-spherical lenses in covariant MOdified Newtonian Dynamics\n\n5\n\nTable 1. Fitting results for selected two-image lens systems from the CASTLES sample: In the table, the observed lens mass M\u2217 is calculated according to Sect.\n7.1 of Zhao et al. (2006, Eqs. (73)-(75)), the parameter rh is the Hernquist length expected from half-light measurements (values are taken from Zhao et al.\n2006). We do not give \u03b72 , but instead we list \u2206 s and compare the inferred values of PA, the Hernquist length h, mass and flux ratio to observations. Additionally,\nwe predict inclination and time delay for the particular lens models. Outliers are characterized by large differences between predicted and observed flux ratios\nand/or anomalous mass ratios M/M\u2217 (deviation larger than a factor of 3) like, for instance, in case of RXJ0921+4529 which resides in a cluster.

In addition, note that there are still some unresolved\nissues in MOND/TeVeS concerning clusters (e.g. Sanders 1999,\n2003, 2007; Angus et al. 2007; Feix et al. 2008).\n\n4.1.2 Q0957+561\nThe gravitational lens Q0957+561 is the most thoroughly studied\none in literature. The system involves a radio-loud quasar at redshift\nzs = 1.41 which is mapped into two images by a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and its parent cluster at redshift zl = 0.36 (e.g.\nKeeton et al. 2000; Barkana et al. 1999, and references therein). It\nis also known that the lens galaxy has a small ellipticity gradient\nand isophote twist which are properties the simple HK model cannot account for. Together with the fact that the lens is embedded\ninto a cluster, this might be a reason for the huge discrepancy between observed and predicted flux ratio in the context of modified\ngravity.\n\n4.1.3 HE1104-1805\nThe lens galaxy's colors are in agreement with a high-redshift\nearly-type galaxy, and its redshift is roughly estimated as zl = 0.77\n(Leh\u00e1r et al. 2000, and references therein). Concerning its lensing\nproperties, the system HE 1104-1805 is quite uncommon in a sense\nthat the lens is closer the bright image, rather than the faint one.\nAs is known from lensing within the standard GR/CDM paradigm,\nsimple models can create such configurations only for a narrow\nrange of parameters due to the peculiar flux ratio. Assuming simple ellipsoidal lens models, however, these parameters imply a large\nmisalignment between the light and the projected density. The only\npossibility to align the mass with the light is to have a shear field\nbeing approximately twice as strong as estimated from the particular lens model.\nFurthermore, the observed image separation is by a factor 2\u22123\n\nlarger than that of a typical lens, strongly suggesting that the separation is enhanced by the presence of a group or a cluster. So far,\nhowever, there has been no direct observational evidence for such\na structure in the lens' surrounding area.\nAnalog to the above-mentioned lens systems, the unsatisfying\nfit and the correspondingly inferred flux ratio might be a result of\nboth lens environment and model limitations (see also Sect. 4.3 and\n4.4).\n\n4.1.4 SBS0909+523\nSBS0909+532 shows two images of background quasar source at\nzs = 1.377 separated by 1.11\u2032\u2032 (e.g. Leh\u00e1r et al. 2000, and references therein). Optical and infrared HST images indicate that the\nlensing galaxy has a large effective radius and a correspondingly\nlow surface brightness. Additionally, the lens galaxy's redshift is\nestimated as zl = 0.83 (Lubin et al. 2000), and its total magnitude\nin the H-band has been measured as H = 16.75 \u00b1 0.74. Although\nthe lens galaxy's colors are poorly measured, they seem consistent\nwith those of an early-type galaxy at the observed redshift.\nThe large uncertainties are a result of the difficulty in subtracting the close pair of quasar images (Leh\u00e1r et al. 2000). For instance,\nthe uncertainty in the I-band magnitude, I = 18.85 \u00b1 0.45, allows\nfor a deviation of the mass estimate M\u2217 by a factor of roughly 2.3 on\na 2\u03c3 level, where we have again used Eqs. (73)-(74) of Zhao et al.\n(2006). Thus, we argue that the low mass ratio (listed in Table 1)\nmay be entirely due to these uncertainties in observed magnitudes,\nwith better constrained observations possibly softening the problem\nin MOND/TeVeS.\n\n4.1.5 HE0512-3329\nThe system HE0512-3329 was discovered as a gravitational lens\ncandidate in the course of a snapshot survey with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), with the images of the quasar\n\n\f6\n\nHuanYuan Shan, Martin Feix, Benoit Famaey and HongSheng Zhao\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n1.6\n1.5\n1.4\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\n0 Declination\n(arcsec)\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n-2\n-2 -1.5 -1 -0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nRA (arcsec)\n\nFigure 2.

Although the lensing galaxy has not been detected yet, measurements of strong metal absorption lines at redshift z = 0.93, identified in the integrated spectrum, hint towards a\ndamped Ly\u03b1 system intervening at this redshift.\nAnalyzing separate spectra of both image components,\nWucknitz et al. (2003) point out that both differential extinction and\nmicrolensing effects significantly contribute to the spectral differences and that one cannot be analyzed without taking into account\nthe other. For lens modeling purposes, the observed flux ratio can\ntherefore only be used after correcting for both effects. Thus, the\nlarge discrepancy between predicted and observed flux ratio might\nbe a consequence of neglecting the above mentioned effects, rather\nthan being intrinsic to MOND/TeVeS.\n\ninvolve a significant amount of external shear in the context of\nGR/CDM. Moreover, the observed anomaly of the flux ratio (\u223c 0.9)\nbetween two of the images strongly hints towards an additional perturbation of the system caused by a satellite galaxy or a globular\ncluster. Similar to Sect. 4.1, we have a gravitationally bound system which will involve a more complicated approach in TeVeS than\nprovided by the isolated HK model.\n\n4.2 Quadruple-imaged systems\nAs we can see from Table 2, most of the quadruple-imaged systems\nare very poorly fitted by our analytic HK lens model for MOND. In\naccordance with our goodness-of-fit criterion (\u2206s < 0.01\u2032\u2032 ) introduced in Sect. 4.1, there is just one system where the model is able\nto predict the image positions in a satisfying manner. Additionally,\nnone of the observed flux ratios can be explained.\nThe only acceptable fit is given for Q2237+030, the nearby\nEinstein cross (zl = 0.04; Huchra et al. 1985), which is the only\ntrue bulge-disc system in our set. Also, its physical Einstein ring\nsize in the lens plane is very small, RE \u2248 0.7kpc (in B1422+231, for\ninstance, it is already by a factor of roughly 10 larger; Rusin et al.\n2003). Nevertheless, it is not possible to give a reasonable explanation for the flux ratios using our smooth MOND lens model. Taking\neffects due to microlensing into account, which are not considered\nin this work, could be able to relax the situation. Note that the lens\ngalaxy actually contains a bar feature (Yee 1988) which is ignored\nin our analysis.\n\n4.2.2 B1422+231\nThe system B1422+231 shows almost the same characteristics as\nPG1115+080 (Kundic et al. 1997, and references therein). Again,\nthe lens belongs to a galaxy group which is centreed south of the\nlens galaxy (zl = 3.62). Kormann et al. (1994a) were able to fit\nthe lensing system using a very flat singular isothermal ellipsoid\n(SIE; Kassiola & Kovner 1993; Kormann et al. 1994b) plus an external shear field. However, HST observations revealed that the lens\ngalaxy's optical axis ratio is much closer to unity than assumed\nfor the flat SIE, favoring rounder lens models with larger external\nshear.\n4.2.3 SDSS0924+0219\nEstimated colors and magnitudes of the lens galaxy are consistent\nwith those of a typical elliptical galaxy at zl = 0.4 (Inada et al.\n2003, and references therein). Although the lens environment does\nnot show any nearby objects perturbing the system, quite an amount\nof external shear is needed to obtain a satisfying fit to observations, with the lens being typically modeled by a (flattened) singular\nisothermal sphere (SIS). Additionally, microlensing plays an important role in explaining the observed flux ratios within GR/CDM,\nwhich is likely to be true in TeVeS as well.\n4.3 Maximum non-spherical shear of a Kuzmin lens\n\n4.2.1 PG1115+080\nThe lens galaxy in PG1115+080 and its three neighbors belong to\na single group at zl = 0.311, with the group being centreed southwest of the lens galaxy's position (Kundic et al. 1997; Impey et al.\n1998, and references therein). Reasonable fits of this lens typically\n\nAs we have seen, the outliers in our selection of quadrupleimage lenses correspond to systems with a large external shear.\nIn PG1115+080, for example, this is due to a neighboring galaxy\ngroup. However, the same situation also appears in uncrowded environments, usually constraining the lensing potential to require\na substantial ellipticity. From Sect. 4.2, it seems that our present\n\n\fAn analytic model for non-spherical lenses in covariant MOdified Newtonian Dynamics\n\n7\n\nTable 2.

As is known, almost all quadruple-imaged systems show evidence for the need of an external shear field (Witt & Mao 1997;\nKassiola & Kovner 1993; Keeton et al. 1997) by violating a certain\ninequality of the image positions. It is perhaps not surprising that\nthe current isolated HK model fails to fit these lenses3 .\nTo gain a better understanding about this issue, we consider a\npure edge-on Kuzmin lens (h = 0) and derive the maximum variation of the shear at the Einstein radius RE by comparing its values\non the major and minor axis. For this reason, let us introduce a\nquantity Q being given as follows:\nQ=\n\n\u03b3(RE , 0) \u2212 \u03b3(0, RE )\n.\n\u03b3(RE , 0) + \u03b3(0, RE )\n\nSDSS0924+0219\n0.39\n1.52\n1116.6\n1867.0\n1252.1\n(\u22120.162, 0.847) \u00b1 0.003\n(\u22120.213, \u22120.944) \u00b1 0.003\n(0.823, 0.182) \u00b1 0.003\n(\u22120.701, 0.388) \u00b1 0.003\n(\u22120.024, \u22120.047)\n(0.019, \u22120.0051)\n2.80/0.32\n1.57\n2.17\n266.4\n40.5\n0.0612\n12.5:5.68:4.81:1\n1.66:0.69:0.86:1\n\n0.25\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n(23)\n\nThe parameter defined above will indicate the level of the shear\nfield's non-sphericity at the Einstein radius and is a function of the\ndimensionless radius RE /b. Note that, in case of the Kuzmin lens,\nthe quantity Q depends on redshift.\nFigure 4 shows Q as function of RE /b for the pure Kuzmin\nmodel (solid line), assuming a0 D/c2 = 0.03. This value has been\nchosen in accordance with the majority of lens redshifts in the\nCASTLES sample, and changing it does have no significant qualitative impact on the basic outcome. Additionally, we also present\nthe result for the SIE model (Kormann et al. 1994b), with the potential axis ratio varying from 0.7 to 0.9 (shown by horizontal lines).\nAs we can see, the Kuzmin model becomes comparable to a very\nround SIE if RE /b & 10.\nTo obtain a sufficiently strong quadruple moment/nonspherical shear at the Einstein radius (Q > 0.2), these disc-only\nmodels must satisfy the condition b > 0.2RE .

However, trying to fit the above mentioned Einstein ring size, using the\nstellar mass only, we also find that this would need a Kuzmin parameter close to zero (b \u2248 0), corresponding to a very concentrated\npoint-like lens. Although we have only given a plausibility argument, rather than a rigorous proof, this could explain why we cannot find a value of b that meets both requirements and why the HK\nmodel mostly fails to fit quadruple-imaged systems.\n4.4 Experimenting with hypothetical lenses\nAnother possibility of investigating the fitting capability of our\nmodel is to generally explore its parameter space and to study the\nstructure of critical curves and caustics. To avoid any limitations\n\n\f8\n\nHuanYuan Shan, Martin Feix, Benoit Famaey and HongSheng Zhao\n\nFigure 5. Experimenting with hypothetical lenses: Shown are the critical curves (black) and caustics (red) of different Dehnen-Kuzmin models characterized\nby the parameters \u03b1, b/(h + b) and inclination (\"core\" radius and PA are fixed to h = 0.72kpc and 77.2\u25e6 , respectively). All models assume a lens mass of\nM = 8 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 which is approximately 8 times the stellar mass of the lens galaxy in PG1115+080. The empty and filled squares denote the observed image\nand source positions of PG1115+080.\n\nFigure 6. Effects of reducing the lens mass: Shown are the critical curves (black) and caustics (red) of a Dehnen-Kuzmin model (\u03b1 = 1, b/(h + b) = 0.38,\nh = 0.72kpc, PA= 77.2\u25e6 and i = 44.5\u25e6 ), assuming M = 8 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 (left panel) and M = 5 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 (middle panel), respectively. The empty and filled squares\ndenote the observed image and source positions of PG1115+080, the stellar mass of the lens is estimated as M\u2217 \u2248 1011 M\u2299 . Right panel: Critical curves (black)\nand caustics (red) of the best-fit SIS+\u03b3ext model given by Eq. (25).\n\nthat might be due to the particularly chosen radial profile, we furthermore replace the auxiliary Hernquist profile with the more general model proposed by Dehnen (1993). Its Newtonian potential\nand the corresponding density profile read as\n\u0012 r \u0013\u03b1 \u0015\nGM \u0014\n\u03a6N,D (r) =\n\u22121 +\n,\n\u03b1\nr+h\n(24)\nMh(1 + \u03b1)\n,\n\u03c1D (r) =\n4\u03c0r2\u2212\u03b1 (r + h)2+\u03b1\nwhere h is a characteristic length of the model. Depending on the\nvalue of \u03b1, the Dehnen model represents different density distributions, ranging from quite cuspy to more broadened profiles. For\n\u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1 = 1, Eq. (24) reduces to the models of Jaffe (Jaffe\n1983) and Hernquist, respectively.\nAllowing different values for \u03b1, we repeat the fitting procedure\nfor the quadruple-imaged systems discussed in Sect. 4.2. The result\nis basically the same as for the HK model, with the parameters\nlisted in Table 2 not significantly changing. In case of the Jaffe\nprofile (\u03b1 = 0), for instance, inclination and PA are altered by about\n5\u25e6 and the predicted mass by approximately 10%.\nTo further illuminate this obvious insufficiency of our model,\nlet us have a more detailed look at the caustic structure, taking the\nsystem PG1115+080 as an example: Choosing a plausible setting\nfor the lens system in MOND, we fix its size to h = 0.72kpc and\n\nthe PA to 77.2\u25e6 (observed value). In accordance with the best-fit\nresults, we additionally assume a lens mass of M = 8 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 and\nvary the Dehnen index \u03b1, the model's \"discyness\" b/(h + b) as well\nas the inclination on a range from \u22121 to 1, 0.1 to 0.9 and 10\u25e6 to\n90\u25e6 , respectively. For a selection of such lenses, the corresponding\ncritical curves and caustics are shown in Fig. 5. Then, among all\nresulting lens models, we select those which exhibit the strongest\n(non-spherical) shear, corresponding to a large astroid caustic size.\nSince the lens mass should be close to the stellar mass (M/M\u2217 \u2243 1)\nin MOND/TeVeS, the idea is now to stepwise decrease the mass of\nthese models. In all cases, we find that, due to the caustics' contraction, the source crosses the astroid caustic way before M/M\u2217\nreaches unity, thus not corresponding to a quadruple-imaged system anymore. Typically, the crossing seems to take place when the\nlens model's mass is roughly around 4 \u2212 6 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299 . For \u03b1 = 1,\nb/(h + b) = 0.38 and an inclination of 44.5\u25e6 , this situation is illustrated in the left and middle panel of Fig. 6. Note that we have kept\nthe source position fixed at (\u22120.011, 0.091)\u2032\u2032 for our analysis, with\nthe lens being centred at the origin.\nAgain, this provides a possible explanation why the DehnenKuzmin model (including the HK model) mostly fails to fit\nquadruple-imaged systems, supporting our earlier conclusion from\nSect. 4.3. Given that M/M\u2217 \u2243 1 in MOND, our model is obviously\nnot able to generate sufficiently strong shear (hence large caustics)\n\n\fAn analytic model for non-spherical lenses in covariant MOdified Newtonian Dynamics\nand a large Einstein ring at the same time. For comparison, we\nalso present the resulting caustics and critical curves of a best-fit\nSIS+\u03b3ext model in the right panel of Fig. 6. As is known, its deflection potential can be expressed as\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b3\n(25)\n\u03a8(\u03be, \u03b8) = c\u03be + \u03be 2 cos 2(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b3 ) .\n2\n\nChoosing the lens' position (xl , yl ) = (0.0028, 0.0048)\u2032\u2032 , c = 1.14\u2032\u2032 ,\n\u03b3 = 0.07 and \u03b8\u03b3 = 88.7\u25e6 , the above model is able to fit observations\nof PG1115+080 satisfyingly.\n\n5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\nIn this paper, we presented a class of analytic non-spherical models, called the Hernquist-Kuzmin models, that we applied to fit\ndouble-imaged and quadruple-imaged lens systems in the context\nof MOND, using the covariant framework of TeVeS. These analytic models interpolate smoothly between a Hernquist sphere and a\nKuzmin disc, and their great advantage is that the solenoidal field of\nMOND, which normally appears in Eq. (1) for non-spherical configurations, is zero. Note that these models are not, stricto sensu,\nbulge-disc models (see Fig. 1).\nAfter having worked out the lensing properties of the models, we devised a fitting procedure in order to fit 15 double-imaged\nsystems and four quadruple-imaged systems in the CfA-Arizona\nSpace Telescope Lens Survey (CASTLES). Since the fitting problem is ill-posed, especially in the case of double-imaged systems,\nwe used a regularization method to ensure the uniqueness of the\nsolution, by penalizing fits deviating from the Fundamental Plane\nas well as face-on and discy fits, and fits with an anomalous massto-light ratio or a large flux anomaly.\nFrom this fitting procedure, we find that our model is\nable to describe the observed image positions of all analyzed\ndouble-imaged systems, and we can safely conclude that 10 of\nthese systems yield plausible parameters within the context of\nMOND/TeVeS. Additionally, our analytic model is able to explain\nthe flux ratios of these binaries in almost every case. One can thus\nconclude that, in general, galaxy lenses do not need dark matter\nin MOND/TeVeS. Note that the implied masses for most of these\nlenses are quite similar to those derived from the spherically symmetric models of Zhao et al. (2006), but that the big advantage\nof our non-spherical model is its ability to fit the precise imagepositions rather than just the size of the Einstein ring.\nOn the other hand, 5 double-imaged systems do not provide a\nreasonable fit: while for two of these systems, the found problems\nare likely to be solved by considering observational uncertainties,\na more accurate model and/or additional effects such as extinction\nand microlensing, the other three lenses appear to be lacking an\nobvious explanation4 . It is however quite striking that all these remaining outliers are actually residing in (or close to) groups or clusters of galaxies. This means that non-linear effects could have an\nimportant incidence, since lensing in MOND is much more sensitive to the three-dimensional distribution of the lens (and of the\nenvironment) than in GR (e.g. Feix et al. 2008). Moreover, it is\nknown for a while that additional dark matter is needed for clusters\nof galaxies in MOND (e.g. Sanders 1999, 2003, 2007; Angus et al.\n4\n\nNote, however, that the stellar mass estimates depend on the adopted initial mass function and star formation rate, and can vary by a factor of 4 in\nthe R-band, which could partly solve the problem of the mass-ratio discrepancy, but not the flux ratio anomalies.\n\n9\n\n2007; Milgrom 2008), and it has recently been shown that this was\nthe case for groups, too (Angus et al. 2008). Possible explanations\nfor this \"cluster dark matter\" in the context of MOND range from\nthe presence of numerous clouds of cold gas (Milgrom 2008) to the\nexistence of sterile neutrinos with a 5eV mass (Gentile et al. 2008),\nthrough the non-trivial effects of the vector field (or of an additional scalar field) in covariant formulations of MOND other than\nTeVeS (e.g. Sanders 2005; Zhao 2007). In any case, many studies,\nincluding the recent analysis of the velocity dispersions of globular\nclusters in the halo of NGC 1399 (Richtler et al. 2008), have also\nprovided evidence for such dark matter on galaxy scales in MOND:\nthis is typical for galaxies residing at the centre of clusters only, and\ncan be interpreted (Richtler et al. 2008) as a small-scale variant of\nthe aforementioned problem of MOND in clusters. This could thus\nprovide an additional, physical, reason to the poor fits obtained here\nfor the two-image lenses residing in groups or clusters.\nFor the four quadruple-imaged systems, it is a different\nstory: the only acceptable fit is obtained for the Einstein cross\nQ2237+030, but even in this case, the observed flux ratios cannot be reproduced. However, the anomalous flux ratios here are\nmost likely due to microlensing effects which have not been considered in our analysis. We can thus conclude that MOND does\nnot provide a solution to the flux anomaly issue, mainly because\nsmooth MOND models naturally predict smooth amplification patterns. Among the 3 very poorly fitted lenses, only PG1115+080 and\nB1422+231 appear in a crowded environment, which could cause\nthe same perturbing effects as for non-isolated double-imaged systems; the remaining lens, SDSS0924+0219, appears relatively isolated.\nWe thus argue that, especially in this particular case, the poor\nfits are due to the intrinsic limitation of our analytic models: we\nindeed showed that our models were unable to produce a large\nEinstein ring and a large shear at the same time. Although we did\nnot present a rigorous proof, we tried to make this limitation plausible by analyzing the maximum non-spherical shear of a TeVeS\nKuzmin lens as well as the caustic structure of different HernquistKuzmin models. To make the mass more concentrated, we also\ntried a Dehnen model (Dehnen 1993), but this did not provide a\nsatisfactory solution either. Again, note that our analysis did not\nconsider any contribution due to external shear effects.\nWe therefore conclude that our analytic models provide good\nMOND fits to the image positions of isolated two-image lenses,\nbut that some problems are encountered for non-isolated two-image\nlenses. On the other hand, we showed that our models were barely\nable to fit quadruple-imaged systems. The present study has thus\npinpointed some lenses for which a full three-dimensional numerical model should be devised in MOND. While these analytic models did obviously not yet represent a definitive test of MOND with\ngravitational lensing, they nevertheless provided a new step in understanding this quite unexplored research area, and in isolating the\npossibly challenging lensing systems for the future.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nHYS and BF acknowledge hospitality at the University of St Andrews.
