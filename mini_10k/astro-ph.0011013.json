We present a semi-empirical model for the evolving far-infrared to ultraviolet diffuse background produced by stars in galaxies. The model is designed to\nreproduce the results of deep galaxy surveys, and therefore may be considered as a\ncosmology-independent lower limit to the extragalactic background light. Using this\nmodel and recent HEGRA data, we infer the intrinsic spectrum at multi-TeV gammaray energies for Mkn 501 and find that it is consistent with a power law of spectral\nindex 2.49 \u00b1 0.04. In turn, this finding renders it rather unlikely that the present-day\ninfrared background has an intensity as high as claimed by Finkbeiner et al. [1]. Future\n10 GeV to TeV observations could be used to either constrain the ultraviolet-to-infrared\nbackground model at high redshifts or cosmological parameters.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHigh-energy gamma-rays originating from sources at cosmological distances can\nbe absorbed by pair production in collisions with low-energy photons. Most of the\nlow-energy photons are produced by stars in ordinary galaxies and contribute to the\nextragalactic background light (EBL). The role of other contributers, such as Active\nGalactic Nuclei, is under dispute, and can safely be assumed to be unimportant in\nterms of the global energy budget. To model the stellar component of the EBL, we\nuse an approach similar to that used in Refs. [2\u20134], however with the star formation\nrate (SFR) inferred from deep multi-color galaxy surveys. Other approaches aim at\nfinding an ab initio description of the SFR from the theory of structure formation\n[5]. Knowing the EBL as a function of redshift, one can calculate the optical depth\nwith respect to pair creation and determine the propagation length of gamma-rays\nfrom cosmologically distributed sources such as Blazars or Gamma Ray Bursts [2,5].\n\n\f2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nCMBR\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n\u03bdI\u03bd (nW m sr )\n\n-1\n-2\n\nAS\nFIR\n\n\u03bdI\u03bd (nW m sr )\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10\n\u03bb (A)\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10\n\u03bb (A)\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n7\n\nFIGURE 1.

Right panel : Present-day EBL with\n(solid line) and without (long dashed line) absorption.

Next, we include absorption and reemission effects (dust and gas of ISM) using a SMC-like extinction law (EB\u2212V ) and\ntwo modified blackbody spectra for the re-emission from dust (T1 > T2 ). The Star\nFormation Rate (SFR) is \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 (z) \u221d (1 + z)\u03b1,\u03b2 with slopes \u03b1 for z \u2264 zp and \u03b2 for\nz > zp , and a peak value \u03c1 \u0307\u2217 (zp ). By choosing proper parameters, the emissivities\n\u01eb\u03bd (z) obtained from integrating the SFR-weighted SSPs are brought to agreement\nwith the data. A second integration from z to zmax yields the EBL comoving power\nspectrum (Fig. 1) which is independent of cosmology due to a cancellation of the\ncosmology-dependent terms. The EBL increases from high redshifts towards the\npresent, but saturates at a roughly constant level beyond the peak in the SFR. The\nEBL spectrum at high z is dominated by young, UV-emitting massive stars. 70%\nof the energy released by stars is re-emitted by dust in the infrared and far-infrared\nbands. The spectrum changes towards its present shape as a result of a growing\nadmixture of aged stars. About 40% of the integrated present-day EBL is contained\nin the IR (between 105 \u00c5 and 107 \u00c5)(see Fig.1 and for details Ref. [7]).\n\nGAMMA-RAY ATTENUATION\nThe pair creation optical depth \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 (E, z) for gamma-rays at cosmological redshift\nz and observed energy E is defined as the ratio of coordinate distance and mean\n\n\f4\n\n10\n\n300.0\n\n3\n\n10\n\nGamma Energy [GeV]\n\n250.0\n\nOptical Depth \u03c4\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nSCDM\n\u039bCDM\nSCDM (flat SFR)\n\n150.0\n\n100.0\n\n50.0\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n(H0=50km/s/Mpc)\n200.0\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\nEnergy[TeV]\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n3.0\nRedshift z\n\n4.0\n\n5.0\n\nFIGURE 2. left panel : Pair-creation optical depth for gamma-rays for a range of redshifts\n(0.03<z<5). right panel : Gamma ray horizon defined by \u03c4 (z, E) = 1 for various models.\n\nfree path [2]. The optical depth evaluated for our EBL and a range of redshifts\n(0.03 < z < 4) is shown in Fig.2 (H0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9 = 1, and \u03a9\u039b = 0).\nWe can use the optical depth of gamma-rays to infer the intrinsic spectrum of\nMkn501 from recent data. This is achieved by simply multiplying the data with\nthe factor exp[\u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 (0.034, E)], and the result is shown in Fig.3.\nThe gamma-ray horizon \u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 (z, E) = 1 defines an interesting relation between\ndistance and cut-off energy. In contrast to the EBL, the gamma-ray horizon depends on cosmology through the integration over a cosmic line element dl/dz. If\nwe switch from a standard Cold Dark Matter model (Fig.2, right panel, solid line)\nto one with a lower matter density (dashed line, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7), the horizon moves\ncloser and the number of sources which can be detected above a given gamma-ray\nthreshold energy decreases. The effect could also be mimicked by a flatter SFR [8].\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have developed a simple model for the evolution of the extragalactic background radiation field using a minimum number of parameters by fitting the emissivity predicted by the model to recent results of high-redshift galaxy surveys. Future improvements will include metalicity effects and a PAH feature around 10\u03bcm.\nThe intrinsic spectrum of Mkn501 inferred from our model is in good agreement\nwith theoretical predictions (see Ref. [9] for a discussion) rendering claims for an\nextremely high level of the infrared background light intensity implausible. The\nEBL model is a powerful tool to analyze gamma-ray spectra from high-redshift\nsources in the 10 GeV to TeV regime for which the pair attenuation occurs in interactions with ultraviolet-to-infrared photons allowing to probe the era of maximum\nstar formation or cosmology.\n\n\f-9\n\ndN/dE\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n-11\n\n-12\n\n-13\n\n-14\n\n-15\n\n1\n\n10\n\nE [TeV]\n\nFIGURE 3.
