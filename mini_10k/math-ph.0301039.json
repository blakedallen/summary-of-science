The main result is also checked against\nthe predictions of conformal field theory. An erratum to the published\nversion has been added in which the above comparison is made\nmore explicit.\n\n\u2217 Address\n\nfor correspondence\n\n1\n\n\fIntroduction\n\nRecently a new method for understanding the scaling limit of conformally invariant twodimensional critical systems has been introduced by Schramm [1] and developed by Lawler,\nSchramm and Werner [2] (LSW). This is known as stochastic Loewner evolution (SLE). It\nrelies on the fact that many such systems may be realised geometrically in terms of sets of\nrandom curves, whose statistics can be described by a stochastic dynamical process. SLE is\nthe continuum limit of this process.\nThere is in fact a continuous family of SLE processes, labelled by a real parameter \u03ba \u2265 0.\nDifferent values of \u03ba are supposed to correspond to different universality classes of critical\nphenomena. For example, for 4 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 8 they describe the perimeters of the Fortuin-Kastelyn\nclusters of the Q-state Potts model with 4 \u2265 Q \u2265 0, while for 2 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 4 they describe the\ngraphs of the high-temperature expansion of the O(n) model with \u22122 \u2264 n \u2264 2 (dual to the\nboundaries of critical Ising spin clusters for n = 1), as well as the external boundaries of\nF-K clusters. This correspondence has so far been proven rigorously only in a few cases [3].\nHowever, if the continuum limit of the lattice curves exists and is conformally invariant, it\nmust be described by SLE [2].\nUnder these assumptions, LSW [2] have rederived many of the known results for twodimensional critical behaviour which have been found by less rigorous approaches such as\nCoulomb gas methods and conformal field theory, as well as establishing some new ones.\nOne aspect of the connection with conformal field theory has recently been pointed out by\nBauer and Bernard [4] and Friedrich and Werner [5].\nThe particular setting we consider in this note is as follows: consider a critical system\nin a disc of radius R, with a puncture at the origin of radius \u01eb, in the limit when R is much\nlarger than \u01eb and the lattice spacing a. Suppose there are exactly N open curves connecting\nthe inner and outer boundaries. In addition, there are no open curves which begin and end\non the outer boundary. See Fig. 1. For example, these curves could be mutually avoiding\nself-avoiding walks [6], or the external boundaries of percolation clusters (both \u03ba = 38 ), or\n2\n\n\fthe boundaries of critical Ising spin clusters (\u03ba = 3.) (In these last two cases we assume that\nthe ensemble is conditioned so as to satisfy the above.) Another example, conjectured to\ncorrespond to to \u03ba = 4, is when the curves are the level lines of a two-dimensional crystalline\nsurface at the roughening transition, and there is a screw dislocation of strength N located\nat the origin. As long as \u03ba \u2264 4 it is known [7] that, in the continuum limit, these curves are\nsimple, that is, they self-intersect with probability zero. For the same reason, the positions\nat which the curves intersect the outer boundary, labelled by complex numbers Rei\u03b8j , are\nwell-defined for \u03ba \u2264 4.\nOur main result is that, for R \u226b \u01eb, the joint probability density function (p.d.f.) of these\npoints is given by Dyson's circular ensemble [8]\nPeq ({\u03b8j }) \u221d\n\nY\n\n1\u2264j<k\u2264N\n\nei\u03b8j \u2212 ei\u03b8k\n\n\u03b2\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03b2 = 4/\u03ba. Our argument proceeds by showing that the SLE process appropriate for\nthis situation contains the Brownian process invented by Dyson [9], whose equilibrium distribution is given by (1), with time being asymptotically proportional to ln(R/\u01eb).\nThe distribution (1) is known to describe the statistics of the eigenvalues of random\nunitary matrices in the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic ensembles for \u03b2 = 1, 2 and 4\nrespectively. Our arguments thus provide simple physical realisations of this ensemble for\nother values of \u03b2 > 1, for example \u03b2 =\n\n3\n2\n\n(self-avoiding walks) and \u03b2 =\n\n4\n3\n\n(Ising spin cluster\n\nboundaries.)\nWe also check (1) against the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). There is a\nsubtle factor of\n\n1\n2\n\nin the exponent which we elucidate. Dyson's process is known to be related\n\nby a similarity transformation to the quantum Calogero-Sutherland model [10]. We point\nan interesting connection between the dilatation operator D \u2261 L0 + L0 of CFT and the\nCalogero-Sutherland hamiltonian.\nIt turns out that the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian may, with suitable boundary conditions, correspond to bulk scaling exponents of the models with \u03ba > 4, an example being\nthe one-arm exponent computed by LSW [11].\n3\n\n\fMultiple SLEs\n\nOur arguments are based on an N-particle generalisation of radial SLE. A single radial\nSLE describes the continuum limit of a curve in the unit disc U := {z : |z| < 1} which\nbegins on the boundary at time t = 0 and ends up at the origin 0 as t \u2192 \u221e. Let K(t) be\nthe hull of the process up to time t (for \u03ba \u2264 4 this is just the set of points on the curve.)\nThere is a conformal mapping gt : U \\ K(t) \u2192 U, such that gt (0) = 0 and gt\u2032 (0) > 0. LSW\nargue that gt (z) may be chosen so as to satisfy an evolution equation\n\u221a\n\ngt (z) + ei \u03baB(t)\n\u221a\n\u0121t (z) = \u2212gt (z)\ngt (z) \u2212 ei \u03baB(t)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere B(t) is a standard one-dimensional Brownian process with E[B(t)2 ] = t. Note that\ntime has been reparametrised so that gt\u2032 (0) = et . (2) is the standard form of radial SLE,\nwhich maps the trace of the SLE into the point ei\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03baB(t)\n\nit is more convenient to consider \u011dt (z; \u03b8) \u2261 gt (z)ei(\u03b8\u2212\n\non the boundary, but for our purposes\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03baB(t))\n\n, which maps the trace into ei\u03b8 ,\n\nand satisfies1\nd\u011dt (z; \u03b8) = \u2212\u011dt (z; \u03b8)\n\n\u221a\n\u011dt (z; \u03b8) + ei\u03b8\ndt \u2212 i\u011dt (z; \u03b8) \u03ba dB(t)\ni\u03b8\n\u011dt (z; \u03b8) \u2212 e\n\n(3)\n\nNow consider N SLE's which start from distinct points {ei\u03b8j } on the boundary, with\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 N. Let Kj (t) be the hull of the jth SLE. For \u03ba \u2264 4 these are segments of non(N )\n\nintersecting simple curves. Let Gt (z) be a function which conformally maps U \\ \u222aN\nj=1 Kj (t)\n(N ) \u2032\n\n(N )\n\nonto U, with Gt (0) = 0 and Gt\n\n(N )\n\n(0) > 0.

Now consider an ensemble\nof these, generated by the configurations of some bulk critical ensemble in the interior of\nU (conditioned if necessary on the existence of exactly N curves.) We argue that if this\ncorresponds to a conformally invariant bulk system, the p.d.f. of the {\u03b8j } must be given by\nPeq . Let K({\u03b8j }, t) be the union of the N hulls up to time t, given that they start at the\npoints {ei\u03b8j }. The expectation value of any observable may be taken by first conditioning on\nthe subset K({\u03b8j }, t\u2032 ), with t\u2032 < t. By conformal invariance, the distribution of K({\u03b8j }, t) \\\n(N )\n\nK({\u03b8j }, t\u2032 ) is the same as that of its image under Gt\u2032 , namely K({\u03b8j (t\u2032 )}, t \u2212 t\u2032 ). Averaging\nover K({\u03b8j }, t\u2032 ) is equivalent to averaging over the {Bj } up to time t\u2032 . Taking t \u2192 \u221e, we\nconclude that\nh\n\nP ({\u03b8j }) = E{Bj (t\u2032\u2032 ):t\u2032\u2032 \u2208[0,t\u2032 ]} P ({\u03b8j (t\u2032 )})\n\ni\n\n(13)\n\nthat is P ({\u03b8j }) is stationary under the process (5), and must therefore be equal to Peq .\nThis is strictly valid only when the SLEs are allowed to reach the origin. To discuss the\ncase when they reach only the circle |z| = \u01eb, it is helpful to map conformally the annulus\nto a cylinder of length l \u2261 ln(R/\u01eb). The points ei\u03b8j are now arrayed around one end of the\n(N )\n\ncylinder. Since \u0120t\n\n(N )\n\n(N )\n\n(N )\n\n= NGt (1 + O(Gt )) as Gt\n\n\u2192 0, we see that as long as l \u226b 1 the\n\neffect of the evolution is to reduce the length of the cylinder at a rate l\u0307 = \u2212N. Meanwhile the\npoints {\u03b8j } are moving according to (5). The approach of their distribution to equilibrium\nis expected to be exponentially fast with a rate constant O(1). Thus, as long as l \u226b N,\nwe may apply the same argument as above, and deduce that the distribution of the {\u03b8j } is\ngiven by Peq , with corrections suppressed by powers of \u01eb/R. The same should apply on a\nlattice, as long as the spacing a < \u01eb \u226a R.\n\n6\n\n\fComparison with conformal field theory\n\nThe crucial assumption of conformal invariance made in deriving the above result would\nappear to be stronger than the analogous statement for N = 1. In particular, it is not clear\n(N )\n\nfrom this point of view why invariance under the uniformising transformation Gt , which\nassumes that the curves grow at the same rate, is to be chosen among other possibilities,\nalthough it appears to be the most natural one. For this reason we have checked our main\nresult (1) using methods of CFT. In this language we expect the joint p.d.f. to be given by\nthe correlation function in the O(n) conformal field theory\nh\u03a6a1 ...aN (0)\u03c6a1 (Rei\u03b81 ) . . . \u03c6aN (Rei\u03b8N )i\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03c6a (Rei\u03b8 ) is a boundary 1-leg operator carrying O(n) index a, and \u03a6 is a bulk N-leg\noperator. By choosing the aj to be all different, we ensure that the curves all reach the\norigin without annihilating. In [12] it was conjectured that the operators \u03c6a correspond\nto Virasoro representations labelled by (1, 2) in the Kac classification. These have a null\nstate at level 2, and therefore their correlators satisfy second-order linear partial differential\nequations with respect to each of the \u03b8j (the BPZ equations [13]). The general solution for\nsuch an N + 1-point correlator is not however known. Instead, we may take the form (1) as\nan ansatz, and check whether it satisfies these equations. Even this is somewhat tedious, and\nwe have carried it through only for N = 2. Alternatively, one may check whether (1) satisfies\nthe fusion rules which follow from the BPZ equations. These determine the behaviour of\nthe correlator (14) in the limits when (say) p of the \u03b8j approach each other. Suppose, for\nexample, that |\u03b8j \u2212 \u03b8k | = O(\u03b4) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 p, with 2 \u2264 p \u2264 N. In the limit\n\u03b4 \u2192 0 we may use the operator product expansion (OPE)\np\nY\n\nj=1\n\n\u03c6aj (\u03b8j ) \u221d \u03b4 xp \u2212px1 \u03c6a1 ...ap (\u03b81 )\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c6a1 ...ap is the boundary p-leg operator, and xp is its scaling dimension. Given that\nthe 1-leg operator corresponds to (1, 2), the fusion rules determine the allowed values of\n7\n\n\fxp which may occur on the right hand side of (15): they are the scaling dimensions h1,n+1\nof the (1, n + 1) operators, with 0 \u2264 n \u2264 p and p \u2212 n even. Duplantier and Saleur [14]\nargued that the p-leg operator must in fact correspond to n = p. Using the Kac formula\nh1,p+1 = p(2p + 4 \u2212 \u03ba)/2\u03ba then gives the exponent in (15) to be simply p(p \u2212 1)/\u03ba.\nOn the other hand, we may simply take the appropriate limit in the ansatz (1) to find\na dependence on \u03b4 of the form\n\nQ\n\n1\u2264j<k\u2264p \u03b4\n\n\u03b2\n\n= \u03b4 p(p\u22121)\u03b2/2 . Comparing these two expressions\n\napparently gives \u03b2 = 2/\u03ba, not 4/\u03ba as found above. One may take further short-distance\nlimits within (1): the results all consistent with Duplantier and Saleur [14] but only if\n\u03b2 = 2/\u03ba.2\nThe resolution of this paradox is as follows: the correlator (1) may be written in operator\nlanguage as\nh\u03a6N |e\u2212tD |{\u03b8j }i\n\n(16)\n\nwhere t = ln(R/\u01eb), D \u2261 L0 + L0 is the generator of scale transformations, and |{\u03b8j }i is a\nboundary state. The usual formalism of CFT assumes that D is self-adjoint: this originates\nin the invariance of the bulk theory under inversions z \u2192 \u22121/z. Equivalently, on the\ncylinder, e\u2212aD is the continuum limit of the transfer matrix, which, for many lattice models,\nmay also be chosen to be self-adjoint. But for the loop representation of the O(n) model\nthis is not the case: the only practicable transfer matrix which has been employed [15] acts,\nat a given time t, on the space spanned by a basis defined by the positions of the points at\nwhich the loops intersect the chosen time slice, together with their relative connections in\nthe 'past', but not the 'future'. This asymmetry leads to a transfer matrix T which is not\n\n2 We\n\nremark that the reason that the N + 1-point correlator (14) has such a simple form is that\n\nthere is only ever a single term on the right-hand side of OPEs like (15). This is because all the\nO(n) indices on the left-hand side are different, and therefore the operators on the right hand side\ntransform according to the totally symmetric representation of O(n). The other possible terms,\nwith n < p, correspond to other representations, and could only arise if some of the aj were equal.\n\n8\n\n\fself-adjoint. In our case, the points at which the loops intersect a given time slice can either\nbe connected back to the points ei\u03b8j at t = 0, or to each other via loops which close in the\npast at times t > 0 (see Fig. 2). Let \u03a0 be the projection operator in the full space in which\nT acts, onto the subspace spanned by the boundary states |{\u03b8j }i. That is, \u03a0 traces over\nthe positions of the points not connected to t = 0. Then Te \u2261 \u03a0T acts wholly within this\n\nsubspace. Note that\n\nRQ\n\nj\n\nd\u03b8j h{\u03b8j }| is a left eigenstate of Te with unit eigenvalue.\n\nAs usual, we may also think of Te as acting on L2 functions of the {\u03b8j } through\n(Te f )({\u03b8\n\nj })\n\n=\n\nZ Y\nj\n\nd\u03b8j\u2032 h{\u03b8j }|Te |{\u03b8j\u2032 }if ({\u03b8j\u2032 })\n\n(17)\n\nso that Te \u2020 1 = 1. Moreover, as ln(R/\u01eb) \u2192 \u221e, the joint p.d.f. of the {\u03b8j } is given by the\nright eigenfunction of Te with the largest eigenvalue.\n\nOn the other hand, the Langevin equation (5) yields the Fokker-Planck equation \u1e56 = LP\n\nfor the evolution of P ({\u03b8j }, t) where\nN\nX\n\n\u2202 \u2202V\n\u03ba \u22022\nL=\n+\n2 \u2202\u03b8j2\nj=1 \u2202\u03b8j \u2202\u03b8j\n\n(18)\n(N )\n\nwhere LPeq = 0 and L\u2020 1 = 0. Now the conformal mapping Gt\n\n\u221d eN t acts as a scale\n\ntransformation near the origin, while its action on the unit disc is described by L. We\ntherefore conjecture that this is nothing but the continuous version of Te , more precisely,\n\u03a0T t \u223c eatL/N , acting on the subspace.\n\nNow for any dynamics which satisfies detailed balance L is related to a self-adjoint\noperator H by a similarity transformation:\n\u22121/2\n1/2\nH = \u2212Peq\nLPeq\n\n(19)\n\n1/2\nThe ground state eigenfunction of H is then Peq\n. This square root is the origin of the\n\ndiscrepancy between the CFT result and (1) with \u03b2 = 4/\u03ba: the self-adjoint operator e\u2212Ht is\nproportional to the scale transformation operator e\u2212Dt where D = L0 + L0 of CFT, acting\non the subspace spanned by the boundary states, that is e\u2212Ht/N \u221d \u03a0e\u2212Dt \u03a0\u2020 . But it does\nnot give the continuum limit of the correct transfer matrix. By assuming that this limit was\n9\n\n\fself-adjoint, which is assumed in the standard formulation of CFT, we found, erroneously,\nthe square root of the correct result (1) with \u03b2 = 4/\u03ba.\nIn the case of Dyson's brownian motion the hamiltonian H is that of the quantum\nCalogero-Sutherland model [10]\nH=\u2212\n\n\u03ba X \u22022\n2\u2212\u03baX\n1\nN(N \u2212 1)\n+\n\u2212\n2\n2\n2 j \u2202\u03b8j\n2\u03ba j<k sin (\u03b8j \u2212 \u03b8k )/2\n2\u03ba\n\n(20)\n\nIt is interesting to note that the adjoint operator L\u2020 = e2V /\u03ba Le\u22122V /\u03ba has the form\nL\u2020 =\n\nXX\n\u03ba X \u22022\n\u2202\n+\ncot((\u03b8j \u2212 \u03b8k )/2)\n2\n2 j \u2202\u03b8j\n\u2202\u03b8j\nj k6=j\n\n(21)\n\nL\u2020 is the generator for a typical first-passage problem. For example, in the case N = 2,\nthe probability h(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ; t) that the two particles have not met up to time t, given that they\nstarted from (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) satisfies \u2202t h = L\u2020 h. In fact, with \u03b8 \u2261 \u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 , and rescaling 2t \u2192 t,\nthis is just the equation derived by LSW [11], whose lowest non-trivial eigenvalue gives the\none-arm exponent, related to the fractal dimension of F-K clusters for \u03ba = 6. Eigenfunctions\nof L\u2020 behave near \u03b8 = 0 as \u03b8\u03b1 where \u03b1 = 0 or 1 \u2212 4/\u03ba. When \u03ba \u2264 4 the appropriate solution\ncorresponds to \u03b1 = 0, or h = 1, consistent with the result that SLE is a simple curve,\nbut when \u03ba > 4 the solution is non-trivial. LSW [11] argue that the appropriate boundary\ncondition at \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 for the one-arm problem is \u2202h/\u2202\u03b8 = 0, and that the solution is then\n( sin(\u03b8/4))1\u22124/\u03ba e\u2212\u03bbt with \u03bb = (\u03ba2 \u2212 16)/32\u03ba. This is of course also an eigenvalue of the\nCalogero-Sutherland hamiltonian (20), and it raises the question as to whether other bulk\nscaling dimensions are given by eigenvalues of Calogero-Sutherland systems with suitable\nboundary conditions.\nAcknowledgements: The author would like to thank M.

A possible explanation of this\ndiscrepancy was given.\nRecently [17], however, we have performed an ab initio CFT calculation. This confirms\nthe exponent 2/\u03ba, but it also shows the correct source of the discrepancy lies in the assumption above Eq. (13) that the measure on the curves is conformally invariant. This is too\nstrong \u2013 if instead we allow for it to be invariant up to a conformal factor\n\nQ\n\nj\n\n|gt\u2032 (ei\u03b8j )|h2,1\n\n(where h2,1 = (6 \u2212 \u03ba)/2\u03ba), the results of the two computations agree.\nThe corresponding Calogero-Sutherland model then turns out out to have \u03b2 = 8/\u03ba.
