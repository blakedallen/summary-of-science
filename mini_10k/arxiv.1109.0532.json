Introduction\nde Sitter space, or slow-roll geometries close to de Sitter space, appear to play an important\nrole in cosmology. For those who believe that extra dimensions exist this has motivated\nsearching for explicit solutions to the higher-dimensional field equations for which the large\nfour dimensions we see are de Sitter or de Sitter-like. Although a few such solutions are\nknown [1, 2], more and more general no-go results [3, 4, 5, 6] show that such solutions are\ndifficult to find1 Why should this be so?\n1\n\nFour-dimensional effective field theories of string theory including non-perturbative effects and anti branes\n\nor D-terms [7] can give rise to de Sitter solutions. But at the moment there is no full understanding from the\nmicroscopic higher-dimensional theory. For other recent attempts for de Sitter solutions see [8].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fIn this paper we argue that part of the problem is that we are not yet using all of the\ningredients that de Sitter solutions require. In particular, contributions are being neglected\nthat are the same size as some of the contributions that are usually kept when searching for\n(or ruling out) de Sitter-like solutions.\nThe neglected contributions come from the actions of any localized sources that may\nbe present in the extra-dimensional configurations of interest. In particular, we argue here\nthat for codimension-two sources these actions contribute to the curvature an amount that\nis competitive with the contribution of the bulk fields, including their back-reaction. In\nparticular, the source action acts to systematically cancel the contribution from the warping\nof the noncompact geometry across the extra dimensions. This is important because the sign\nof the warping contribution is usually definite, and because it is opposite to what is required\nfor a de Sitter noncompact geometry it plays a role in the various extant de Sitter no-go\nresults.\n1.1 No-go results and the 6D loophole\nOur interest is in D-dimensional metrics of the form\nds2 = \u011dM N dxM dxN = e2W (y) g\u03bc\u03bd (x) dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + g\u0303mn (y) dy m dy n ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere D = d + n; the d-dimensional metric, g\u03bc\u03bd , is maximally symmetric (i.e. flat, de Sitter\nor anti-de Sitter); and the warp factor, W , can depend on position in the n compact directions\n(whose metric, g\u0303mn , is so far arbitrary).\nIn particular, for cosmological applications there is much interest in identifying solutions\nto higher-dimensional field equations for which g\u03bc\u03bd is a de Sitter metric (which in our curvature\nconventions2 satisfies R = g \u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd < 0). The search for such solutions has been fairly barren,\nand this is partly explained by refs. [3], [4], [5] and [6], who identify increasingly general\nobstacles to finding this type of de Sitter solution to sensible, higher-dimensional, secondderivative field equations.\nOn the other hand, a handful of explicit solutions of this type do exist, including 4D de\nSitter solutions [1] for six-dimensional Maxwell-Einstein systems,\nSM E = \u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\n6\n\nd x\n\np\n\n\u2212\u011d\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n1\n1 MN\nMN\n\u011d R\u0302M N + FM N F\n+\u039b ,\n2\u03ba2\n4\n\n(1.2)\n\nWe use a 'mostly plus' metric and Weinberg's curvature conventions [9], which differ from those of MTW\n\n[10] only in the overall sign of the definition of the Riemann tensor.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fwith positive 6D cosmological constant, \u039b. Similar solutions [2] also exist for six-dimensional\ngauged, chiral supergravity [11], whose relevant bosonic action is\nSbulk = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nd6 x\n\np\n\n\u2212\u011d\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\u0011 1\n2 gR2 \u03c6\n1 MN \u0010\n\u2212\u03c6\nMN\ne\nF\nF\n+\n\u011d\ne\nR\u0302\n+\n\u2202\n\u03c6\n\u2202\n\u03c6\n+\n.\nMN\nMN\nM\nN\n2\u03ba2\n4\n\u03ba4\n\n(1.3)\n\nFor both of these actions R\u0302M N denotes the Ricci tensor for the 6D metric, \u011dM N , and F = dA\nis the field strength for a 6D gauge potential, AM . The quantity \u03ba2 = 8\u03c0G6 denotes the 6D\n\ngravitational coupling, while for the supersymmetric case gR denotes the gauge coupling of a\nspecific UR (1) gauge group that does not commute with 6D supersymmetry.\nThese examples do not contradict the various no-go theorems because they arise in systems which do not satisfy one of the assumptions of each. For instance, the no-go result of [4]\nassumes that any extra-dimensional scalar potential must be negative (as it tends to be for\nhigher-dimensional supergravities, but is not so for eqs. (1.2) and (1.3)). They evade the less\nrestrictive assumptions of [5] and [6], some of which exclude [6] having only two extra dimensions, n = 2. More importantly, for this paper, they do not satisfy the average 'boundedness'\nassumptions [5] that exclude solutions that are too singular.\n1.2 The potential relevance of back-reaction\nThere are two ways to view the possibility that singular behaviour can suffice to evade the\nno-go results. One view is to regard solutions with such singularities as unacceptable, and so\ndraws the conclusion that de Sitter solutions may be impossible to find. And for some types\nof singularity (like negative-mass black holes) this is probably right, since the alternative\nrequires admitting energies that are unbounded from below.\nBut some (apparent) singularities are known to be perfectly sensible, such as those seen in\nCoulomb's law at the position of a source charge. In the case of Coulomb's law, the singularity\ndoesn't preclude taking the solution seriously because we don't intend to trust the solution\nin any case right down to zero size. The existence of apparent singularities might similarly\nbe expected to arise in the gravitational theories relevant to cosmology, provided these are\nregarded as effective descriptions of some more-microscopic degrees of freedom. One can\nhope to get a handle on deciding whether a singularity might be reasonable for an effective\ndescription, by seeing what kinds of apparent singularities actually can emerge from localized\nsources governed by physically reasonable actions.\nThese considerations suggest that understanding the back-reaction of localized sources\ncould be a crucial part of obtaining de Sitter solutions, or ruling them out. In particular the\nasymptotics, and apparent divergence, of bulk fields near a source is likely to be important,\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fand is ultimately controlled by the action that describes the dynamics of that source. Notice\nfor these purposes 'source' need not mean a fundamental object, like a D-brane. Rather,\nit could describe something more complicated, like a soliton or a higher-dimensional brane\nwrapping internal dimensions, a localized but strongly warped region, or a more complicated\nobject (like a nucleus or a star). All we need know is that the sources are much smaller than\nthe extra dimensions within which they sit.\nHow the properties of a source affect the properties of bulk fields is best understood at\npresent for codimension-one and codimension-two sources. For codimension-one sources, the\nback-reaction is described by the Israel junction conditions [12], as is familiar from RandallSundrum models [13]. But bulk fields with codimension-one sources also tend not to diverge\nat the source positions, and so shed little light on how such singularities influence the lowenergy curvature. It is only for higher-codimension sources that it is generic that bulk fields\ndiverge at the source positions, and so where the relation between bulk singularity and source\nproperties can be explored.\nOf course, these bulk singularities make matching bulk solutions to source properties more\ncomplicated, usually requiring a renormalization of the source [14]. The tools for detailed\nbulk-source matching and renormalization are most explicitly known for codimension-two\nobjects [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. In particular, these tools have recently been used to identify\n[20] explicit objects that can source the de Sitter solutions [2] of the 6D supergravity action,\neq. (1.3). Since the required source properties seem physically reasonable,3 they show that\nthe singularities in the corresponding bulk solutions need not be regarded as grounds for their\nrejection.\n1.3 Summary of results\nIn the rest of this paper we examine how source back-reaction constrains the existence of\nde Sitter solutions in more general higher-dimensional theories than the six-dimensional ones\nalready explored.\nIn particular, we explore some of these issues in eleven-dimensional supergravity, and\nin ten-dimensional Type IIB and Type IIA supergravity. Because our best-developed tools\napply to codimension-two objects, it is these we largely explore in detail. If only D-branes\nwere allowed as sources, this would restrict us to D7-branes in Type IIB systems. But we also\nexplore the other supergravities for two reasons: because some of our results apply equally\n3\n\nAs discussed in more detail below, their worst feature appears to be a requirement that the dilaton, \u03c6, grows\n\nas one asymptotically approaches the sources, and so care must be taken to avoid leaving the weak-coupling\nregime before reaching the source.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fwell to higher-codimension sources; and because our sources might not be D-branes - or\n(p, q) branes for that matter - but instead be more complicated localized codimension-two\nquantities (like very small warped throats).\nWe find the following results:\n\u2022 First, for geometries of the form of eq. (1.1), we find a very general classical relationship\n\nthat gives the curvature in the non-compact dimensions parallel to the sources as the\nsum of four terms: R \u221d I + II + III + IV , where IV vanishes for maximally symmetric\ngeometries in the absence of space-filling fluxes.\n\n\u2022 Second, we show that contribution I - which is proportional to the bulk action evalu-\n\nated at the classical back-reacted solution - is very generally given as the integral of a\n\ntotal derivative, and so is controlled by the boundary values of a particular combination\nof bulk fields. This property relies only on the existence of a classical scale invariance\nthat is shared by most higher-dimensional supergravities (and holds in particular for\n11D and 10D Type IIA and IIB supergravity).\n\u2022 Third, we show that for codimension-two sources the contributions II and III cancel\n\none another. Here contribution II is an integral over a total derivative of the warp\n\nfactor, W , whose definite sign plays an important role in the derivation of the general\nno-go results. Contribution III comes from the action of the localized source, which is\nleft out of most no-go analyses.\n\u2022 Finally, we explicitly identify the total derivative that appears in I for several examples\n\nof interest, including commonly used supergravities in 6, 10 and 11 dimensions. This\nidentifies the combination of fields whose near-brane asymptotics is relevant to the lowenergy curvature. As a simple application we show that the noncompact dimensions\nare always flat for all F-theory compactifications that involve only the metric and axiodilaton with codimension-two sources.\n\nThese results carry two important messages. First, since the direct contributions from\nthe source action cancel important contributions in the no-go theorems, the bad news is\nthat back-reaction cannot be neglected when determining the curvature of the noncompact\ndimensions. But second, because the nonzero contributions are total derivatives, the good\nnews is that most of the details of the back-reacted solutions are not important. All that\ncounts is the near-source asymptotics of a specific combination of back-reacted bulk fields.\nOur explanation of these results is organized as follows. The next section, \u00a72, develops\n\ngeneral expressions for how the curvature of non-compact, maximally symmetric directions\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fdepends on the properties of the extra-dimensional bulk fields. Much of this section is similar\nin spirit to the arguments made when deriving no-go results [3, 4, 5, 6], and our main new\ncontribution is to cleanly identify how the curvature is controlled by asymptotic forms near\nthe sources, and to see how assumptions about source dynamics modifies this asymptotics.\n\u00a72 also explicitly identifies for 11D and 10D supergravity the precise combination of bulk\nfields whose asymptotic forms are relevant to the low-energy curvature. \u00a73 then applies these\n\ngeneral arguments to the special case of metric/axio-dilaton configurations in 10D Type IIB\nsupergravity with codimension-two sources, showing in this case how all solutions are flat in\nthe noncompact directions in the absence of bulk fluxes. We summarize our conclusions in\n\u00a74, and several appendices provide details of calculations used in the main text.\n\n2. Low energy curvature and near-source asymptotics\nThe purpose of this section is to derive a general expression for the curvature of the noncompact directions that is our main result. We do so by paralleling arguments made elsewhere\nfor six-dimensional supergravities [2, 15, 17].\nWe make the connection between on-source curvatures and near-source asymptotics in\nthree steps. First, in \u00a72.1 we show - at the classical level for maximally symmetric source\ngeometries - that the integral of the low-energy curvature can be computed as the sum of\nfour terms: I + II + III + IV . Of these, I is the higher-dimensional bulk action, evaluated\nat the compactified solution. II is the integral over a total derivative, which Gauss' theorem\ndirectly relates to the boundary values of the warp factor, at infinity and near any potential\nsingularities. III is a direct contribution from the action of any sources, and IV is a term\nwhich vanishes in the absence of any space-filling fluxes.\nNext, the second step is taken in \u00a72.2, which shows that for all of the supergravities of\n\ninterest the higher-dimensional bulk lagrangian density is itself also always a total derivative\n\nwhen evaluated at an arbitrary classical solution. Combining this with step one then shows\nthat, in the absence of space-filling fluxes, the integrated low-energy curvature is completely\ncontrolled by source and boundary effects.\nFinally, \u00a72.3 demonstrates step three. By treating carefully the singular behaviour near\n\nany codimension-two sources, it is shown that contributions II and III precisely cancel one\nanother. Taken together, these three steps show that only contribution I plays any role in a\nbroad class of theories.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f2.1 Step 1: Integrating out the bulk\nWe first focus on step one: we use the higher dimensional equations of motion to derive\na relationship between the lower dimensional curvature and the on-shell higher-dimensional\naction. For definiteness, we consider solutions to the field equations of a D-dimensional\n(super)gravity theory, with action4\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\np\n1\nD\nD\nd z \u2212\u011dD \u2212 R\u0302 + Lmatter + Ssource ,\nS= 2\n2\u03baD\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere Lmatter depends on a generic set of other D-dimensional fields (but not on the derivatives\n\nof the metric), denoted collectively by \u03c8. Ssource denotes the action of any sources, which\ndiffers from the term explicitly written by only involving an integration over d dimensions,\nrather than D.\nNow imagine we have a solution to the field equations for this action describing a compactification down to 0 < d = D \u2212 n dimensions, of the form of eq. (1.1). We wish to derive a\n\ngeneral expression for R = g \u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd in terms of properties of the warp-factor, W , the compact\nmetric, g\u0303mn , and the bulk- and source-matter actions.\nTo this end consider the \u03bc\u03bd component of Einstein's equation,\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0011 \u2202LD\np\n\u03b4Ssource\n1 \u03bc\u03bd \u0010\nmatter\nD\n2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212R\u0302 + Lmatter +\n+ 2\u03baD\n= 0,\n\u2212\u011dD R\u0302 + \u011d\n2\n\u2202\u011d\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b4\u011d\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich we contract with \u011d\u03bc\u03bd , making use of\n\n \u0303 2 W + d2 g\u0303mn \u2202m W \u2202n W\n\u011d\u03bc\u03bd R\u0302\u03bc\u03bd = e\u22122W R + d \u2207\n \u0303 2 edW ,\n= e\u22122W R + e\u2212dW \u2207\n\n(2.3)\n\n \u0303 2 = g\u0303 mn \u2207\n \u0303 m\u2207\n \u0303 n .

We use R\u0302M N to denote the D-dimensional Ricci curvature of the full D-dimensional metric, \u011dMN ;\nand R\u0302\u03bc\u03bd to denote the d-dimensional Ricci curvature computed from the d-dimensional metric, \u011d\u03bc\u03bd = e2W g\u03bc\u03bd .\nFinally, \u011dD = det \u011dM N while \u011dd = det \u011d\u03bc\u03bd etc.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fwhere Son\u2212shell means the bulk part of the action appearing in eq.

(2.4) is the key equation, and so far it has been derived on very general grounds. We\nnow specialize to the situation where the solution does not break the maximal symmetry of\nthe d-dimensional metric g\u03bc\u03bd .\nMaximal symmetry is a very constraining condition. First, it implies R is a constant, so\nthe left-hand-side of eq. (2.4) is proportional to the (divergent) volume of the noncompact\ndimensions. Furthermore, the left-hand-side vanishes only for flat d-dimensional space, and\nits sign is controlled by the sign of R.\nSecond, maximal symmetry strongly restricts the form of \u2202LD\nmatter /\u2202\u011d\u03bc\u03bd for the field\ncontent usually found in higher-dimensional supergravity. In particular, the only fields that\ncan be nonzero (classically) for maximally symmetric solutions are: the metric, g\u03bc\u03bd ; spacefilling fluxes of the form\n= \u01eb\u03bc1 ..\u03bcd Gm1 ...mp\u2212d ;\nF\u03bc(p)\n1 ..\u03bcd m1 ..mp\u2212d\n\n(2.6)\n\nand any number of d-dimensional scalar fields (like components of g\u0303mn , etc.).\n\u221a\nBecause LD is defined with an overall factor of \u2212\u011dD factored out, and because the\nEinstein term is also treated separately, in the absence of higher-derivative interactions\n\n\u2202LD\nmatter /\u2202\u011d\u03bc\u03bd = 0 if only scalar fields and the metric are present. For the supergravities\nof interest here the only nonvanishing contributions to \u2202LD\nmatter /\u2202\u011d\u03bc\u03bd arise from p-form fields\n(with p \u2265 d), having nonzero space filling components.\nFor instance, for a p-form field with kinetic term\nLD\np\u2212form = \u2212\n\n1\nF2 ,\n2 p! (p)\n\n(2.7)\n\nand non-vanishing space filling components we have\n\u011d\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2202LD\nd\nd G2\nmatter\nGm1 ..mp\u2212d Gn1 ..np\u2212d g\u0303m1 n1 g\u0303m2 n2 * * * \u011d mp\u2212d np\u2212d = \u2212\n, (2.8)\n=\u2212\n\u2202\u011d\u03bc\u03bd\n2(p \u2212 d)!\n2(p \u2212 d)!\n\nwhich contributes to the right-hand-side of eq. (2.4) the amount\nZ\nZ\np\nd\nd \u221a\nd x \u2212gd dn y g\u0303n edW G2 .\n\u2212 2\n2\u03baD (p \u2212 d)!\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fWe note that this is negative definite, which (in our conventions) contributes to R with an\nanti-de Sitter-like sign.\nOf course, space-filling fluxes need not contribute to eq. (2.4) only through their kinetic\nterm. The quantity \u2202LD\nmatter /\u2202\u011d\u03bc\u03bd can also receive contributions from Chern-Simons terms.\n\u221a\nIn this case, because LD\nCS matter = LCS / \u2212gD , the contribution is simply proportional to the\n\nChern-Simons term itself:\n\nZ\n\u2202LD\nd\nCS matter\n=\u2212\nLCS .\n\u2202\u011d\u03bc\u03bd\n2\nUnlike for the kinetic term, this contribution can have indefinite sign.\n\u011d\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2.10)\n\nWe see that in the absence of space-filling flux, the last term in equation (2.4) vanishes.\nWhen this is so, eq. (2.4) relates the d-dimensional curvature, R, to a total derivative, a\nderivative of the source action, and the bulk action evaluated on shell (which we show below\nis often also a total derivative).\nThe restriction to no space-filling fluxes is also not very restrictive, because one can\nusually (Hodge) dualize a flux to get rid of any space filling components. But there can be\nsome situations where this cannot be done, such as when the flux in question is the self-dual\nfive form of Type IIB supergravity. In this case the self-duality condition relates the flux\ncomponents in the internal and space-time directions. Appendix A uses several well-known\nexamples to illustrate how eq. (2.4) works in practice (in the absence of source terms), with\nand without space-filling flux.\n2.2 Step 2: A general expression for Son\u2212shell\nThis section now proves that Son\u2212shell can generally also be expressed as the integral of a\ntotal derivative for the bulk supergravities of general interest.\nThis is actually a special case of a more general result [21] that states that any scaleinvariant system has this property, as we review here. It is generic to higher-dimensional\nsupergravities because these typically all have a classical scale invariance [22].\nConsider therefore a generic collection of fields, \u03c6i , described by a lagrangian density\nthat scales as L \u2192 sp L when the fields scale as \u03c6i \u2192 sai \u03c6i , for some constants s, p and ai :\n\u0001\n\u0001\nL sai \u03c6i , sai \u2202\u03bc \u03c6i \u2261 sp L \u03c6i , \u2202\u03bc \u03c6i .\n(2.11)\nThis scaling property of the action ensures the invariance of the field equations.\n\nEq. (2.11) should be read as being an identity for all s and for all fields \u03c6i . Differentiating\nwith respect to s and evaluating the result at s = 1 then gives the identity\n\u0013 \u0015\n\u0012\nX \u0014\u0012 \u2202L \u0013\n\u2202L\ni\nai\n\u03c6i = p L ,\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 +\n\u2202 [\u2202\u03bc \u03c6i ]\n\u2202\u03c6i\ni\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n(2.12)\n\n\ffor all \u03c6i . But solutions to the field equations satisfy\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u2212 \u2202\u03bc\n= 0,\n\u2202\u03c6i\n\u2202 [\u2202\u03bc \u03c6i ]\n\n(2.13)\n\nand so using this in eq. (2.12) implies\nLon\u2212shell =\n\nX ai\ni\n\np\n\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n\u0014\u0012\n\n\u2202L\n\u2202 [\u2202\u03bc \u03c6i ]\n\n\u0013\n\ni\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(2.14)\n\nThat is, the lagrangian evaluates to a total derivative at any classical solution.\nWe next pause to record the explicit form for the total derivative for the 6D supergravity\nfor which de Sitter solutions are known to exist, and for the 11D and 10D supergravities of\nmore general interest here. The details of these evaluations are given in Appendix B.\n6D supergravity\nAs a point of reference, we restate here the on-shell action as computed [21] for chiral, gauged\nsupergravity [11] in six dimensions. The relevant bosonic action, S 6 , is given in eq. (1.3)\nand scales as S 6 \u2192 s2 S 6 when \u011dM N \u2192 s\u011dM N and e\u2212\u03c6 \u2192 s e\u2212\u03c6 . The on-shell lagrangian is\n\ntherefore a total derivative, and is seen by explicit evaluation to be\nZ\np\n1\n6\nSon\u2212shell = 2 d6 x \u2212\u011d6 \u0003\u03c6 .\n2\u03ba6\n\n(2.15)\n\nIn our conventions, when used in eq. (2.4), this shows that an AdS sign corresponds\nto \u03c6 decreasing near the source, while a de Sitter sign arises when \u03c6 increases towards the\nsource (a property that may also be directly verified of the explicit de Sitter solutions [2, 20]).\nSince e2\u03c6 counts loops in this system, consistency of the classical approximation requires that\none encounters the physics that regulates the source before leaving the weak-coupling regime\ne\u03c6 \u226a 1. Although this sounds worrisome, similar considerations apply to the gravitational\n\nfield of a macroscopic source like the Earth. The large curvatures encountered if this field\nwere extrapolated to zero size would also eventually invalidate a semiclassical approximation;\nbut are not a problem in practice due to the prior intervention of the Earth's surface.\n11D supergravity\nFor 11D supergravity the bosonic action is\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\np\n1\n1\n1\n11\n2\n11\nS =\u2212 2\nG \u2212\nd x \u2212\u011d11 R\u0302 +\nG4 \u2227 G4 \u2227 C3 .\n2(4!) 4\n2\u03ba11\n12\u03ba211\n\nThis scales as S 11 \u2192 s9/2 S 11 when \u011dM N \u2192 s\u011dM N and CM NP \u2192 s3/2 CM NP .\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(2.16)\n\n\fAs argued above, this scaling behaviour implies that the on-shell lagrangian is a total\nderivative. Using the field equations gives the following total derivative expression for the\non-shell 11D action:\n11\n=\u2212\nSon\u2212shell\n\n1\n6\u03ba211\n\nZ\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nd C3 \u2227 \u2217G4 .\n\n(2.17)\n\nWe note that the expression has explicit dependence on the potential C3 , thus one can get nontrivial contributions from the patching of gauge charts. We hope to explore such contributions\nin the future.\n10D Type IIA supergravity\nThe story for the 10D Type IIA supergravity action is similar.

(2.4) is\na total derivative? We care precisely because the bulk fields are generically singular at the\nspecific points in the n compact dimensions where the sources are located. To deal with this\nsingularity, as well as any singularities coming from Ssource , we imagine surrounding these\nobjects in the transverse dimensions by a 'Gaussian pillbox' at a small proper distance from\nthe source. This removes the singularity at the source at the expense of introducing a new\nboundary on the Gaussian pillbox.\nWhen the bulk contribution to the right-hand-side of eq. (2.4) is a total derivative, its\nintegral depends only on the near-source limit of the back-reacted bulk fields at the pillbox.\nAnd these boundary conditions, in turn, are related to the physical properties of the source at\nycm allowing them to be combined with the Ssource terms in a general way, as the next section\ndiscusses in more detail.\nThe upshot is that although explicitly finding the back-reacted bulk solution for a given\nsource is very difficult, when the curvature depends only on a total derivative most of the\ndetails of these solutions are not important. It is only their near-brane boundary conditions\nthat play any role in fixing the on-source curvature, R.\n2.3 Step 3: Sources and singularities\nThe final step is to relate more precisely the boundary contributions to the bulk integrals\nencountered above to the properties of the source action, Ssource . As we now see, this allows\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fcontribution II to be related to contribution III in eq. (2.4), with the result that they cancel\nfor codimension-two sources.\nThe trick when doing so is to deal properly with the singularity of the bulk configurations\nnear the sources. We follow a strategy familiar from experience with the Coulomb singularity\nof electrostatics: we surround the sources with small 'Gaussian pillboxes,' and replace the\nsingular extrapolation into the pillbox interior with an appropriate set of boundary conditions\non the surface of the box. In this way the singular physics of a point charge is finessed into\na finite flux through an arbitrary, but small, surface enclosing the charge.\nOf course, this is only a useful construction if the size of the charge distribution is much\nsmaller than the distances of interest for predicting the resulting electric field. If the box is\ntoo small compared with the charge distribution inside, the real charge distribution inside\ncannot be approximated by a point source with the same total charge. A similar problem\narises if the box is too large compared with the scales over which the electric fields are to be\ncomputed. The construction is useful if a sufficiently large hierarchy exists between the size\nof the source and the distances of interest for the resulting electric fields.\nThe same is possible for gravitating systems, provided the physical size of the source is\nmuch smaller than the distance over which the gravitational field extends (like the size of\nany extra dimensions). To accomplish this in the present context [15, 17], we excise a small\nD-dimensional spacetime volume from around each source, and instead specify the boundary\nconditions on boundary to this small volume.\nIn the spirit of replacing a real charge distribution by an equivalent point charge, the\nboundary conditions are specified by doing so for a simple source distribution that shares\nthe same energy. This is most simply done by imagining the source energy density to be\ndistributed on the boundary of the pillbox itself, with the pillbox interior filled in with a\nsmooth field configuration. Such a simple-minded procedure suffices to capture the longdistance physics of a generic real distribution if the pillbox is sufficiently small, with the size\nof the actual source of interest being much smaller still.\nFormally this is done by specifying a (D \u2212 1)-dimensional codimension-one boundary\naction, Sebdy , on the pillbox surface, together with a smooth solution describing the pillbox\n\ninterior. This construction allows boundary conditions to be inferred using standard methods\ninvolving the Israel junction conditions [12], which relate Sebdy to the jump in bulk-field\n\nderivatives between inside and outside of the pillbox.\n\nOnce these junction conditions are found, a new point of view is possible for which the\npillbox is regarded as an honest-to-God boundary of the bulk geometry, without reference to\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fthe pillbox interior. In this case one defines a new boundary action for the pillbox, Sbdy , which\nis defined by the condition that its derivatives determine the near-source radial derivatives\nof the fields exterior to the pillbox. In general Sbdy differs from Sebdy because it must now\nalso include any effects that used to be generated by the now non-existent interior geometry.\n\nSbdy also includes the Gibbons-Hawking action [25] for gravity on the boundary, both of the\n\ninterior and exterior regions:\n\nwith\n\nSbdy := Sebdy + SGH + + SGH \u2212 + Sint ,\nSGH\n\n1\n= 2\n\u03baD\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\ndD\u22121 x \u2212\u03b3 K ,\n\n(2.26)\n\n(2.27)\n\nand K = g ij Kij , where Kij is the extrinsic curvature of the boundary and \u03b3ij the induced\nmetric. The subscript \u00b1 for SGH \u00b1 indicates whether the extrinsic curvature is to be computed\n\njust inside or just outside of the codimension-one pillbox boundary. The Gibbons-Hawking\naction is required in the presence of boundaries to make the variation of the Einstein action\nwell-posed. Finally, Sint describes the 'bulk' action describing the interior geometry, whose\ndetails are not important in what follows when the pillbox is sufficiently small.\nIn the limit of a vanishingly small pillbox, these codimension-one actions can be compactified into corresponding higher-codimension actions. We define Sesource to be the result\nobtained from Sebdy in this way, but it is the dimensional reduction of Sbdy that compactifies\nto the d-dimensional source action, Ssource , used in previous sections.\n\nThis procedure has been worked through in detail for scalar-tensor-Maxwell theories with\n\ncodimension-two sources in D = d + 2 dimensions [15], to which we now specialize. The resulting boundary conditions were then checked for D7-brane sources in Type IIB supergravity\nin 10 dimensions, for which the bulk and source actions are explicitly known, as are a broad\nclass of solutions to the bulk field equations [23]. In all cases the solutions and actions satisfy\nthe boundary conditions inferred using this simple-minded pillbox construction [17].\nFor the present purposes it turns out that we need only the boundary conditions for the\nmetric. Using the Israel junction conditions to relate an assumed smooth interior geometry\nfor the pillbox to the geometry outside, one finds the following junction conditions, expressed\nin terms of the codimension-one action, Sebdy , of the codimension-one source:5\n5\n\n\u0001\n\u03b4Sebdy\n1 p\n\u2212\u011dD K ij \u2212 Kgij \u2212 (int)ij =\n.\n2\n2\u03baD\n\u03b4\u011dij\n\n(2.28)\n\nThe difference in signs compared to [17] arises from the choice of unit normal. Here, K is defined with\n\nrespected to the outward pointing normal, to agree with the convention for the Gibbons-Hawking term.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fThis expression adopts coordinates near the pillbox for which \u03c1 denotes radial proper distance\naway from the source, which is located at \u03c1 = 0. The pillbox boundary lies on a surface of\nfixed, small \u03c1, for which Kij is the extrinsic curvature of the fixed-\u03c1 surface, for which the\nlocal coordinates are {xi } = {x\u03bc , \u03b8}, with i = 0, 1, * * * , d where d = D \u2212 2 and \u03b8 is an angular\n\ncoordinate that runs from 0 to 2\u03c0 as one encircles the source. Finally, '(int)ij ' denotes the\n\nsame result evaluated for the smooth interior geometry, for which \u03c1 = 0 is nonsingular.\nAs mentioned earlier, there are two equivalent ways to read eq. (2.28). The first is the\nway it was initially derived: where Sebdy represents only the action of the boundary, and the\n\ninterior region of the brane is matched onto the exterior one through eq. (2.28). The other\nviewpoint is that the pillbox is considered the actual boundary of spacetime, and the 'interior'\n\nof the branes is excised entirely. In this point of view, the properties of the interior solutions\nare encoded in the boundary action, Sbdy :\n\u0001 \u03b4Sebdy\n\u03b4Sbdy\n1 p\nij\nij\n+ (int)ij =\n.\n\u2212\u011d\nK\n\u2212\nKg\n=\nD\n2\u03ba2D\n\u03b4\u011dij\n\u03b4\u011dij\n\n(2.29)\n\nIn the limit of a very small pillbox, these conditions dimensionally reduce to conditions\nthat only refer to the codimension-two action.\n\u0014\n\u0015\nI\n\u0001\n1 p\n\u03b4Sesource\nij\nij\nij\n\u2212\u011d\nd\u03b8\nlim\n,\nK\n\u2212\nK\n\u011d\n\u2212\n(int)\n=\n\u03c1\u21920 x\n2\u03ba2D\n\u03b4\u011dij\nb\n\n(2.30)\n\nwhere the integration is about a small circle of proper radius \u03c1 encircling the brane position\nat \u03c1 = 0, and NM is the unit normal pointing towards the brane (NM dxM = \u2212d\u03c1).\n\nThe upshot is that source-bulk matching relates the asymptotic, near-source radial deriva-\n\ntives of the bulk fields to the properties of the source action. In what follows, an important\nrole is played by the function, Usource , that controls the codimension-two boundary condition\nfor the warp factor, W ,\nI\np\nd\n\u2212\u011dD N M \u2202M W =\nlim\nd\u03b8\n\u03ba2D \u03c1\u21920\n:=\n\ni\n\u2202 h\u221a\n\u2212gd Lesource\n\u2202g\u03b8\u03b8\n\u221a\nd \u2212gd Usource ,\n2\n\n(2.31)\n\nwhere the last equality defines Usource , and Lesource is the codimension-two lagrange density\nZ\np\ne\nSsource = dd x \u2212\u011dd Lesource .\n(2.32)\n\nThe function Usource is important6 for other reasons, besides its above role in controlling\n\nthe asymptotic behaviour of the warp factor. As we show below, for codimension-two sources\n6\n\nAlthough determination of Usource appears to require knowing how Ssource depends on g\u03b8\u03b8 , this is actually\n\nnot necessary because the it is related [17] by an identity - the 'Hamiltonian' constraint for evolution in the\n\u03c1 direction, since this relates the first derivatives of bulk fields with respect to \u03c1 - to the easily computed\nderivatives \u03b4Ssource /\u03b4\u03c6a and \u03b4Ssource /\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fUsource turns out also to be the Lagrange density of the full action, Ssource [15, 17]. It turns out\nthat Usource is generically non-negative, and this is related to the general property (described\nbelow) that the bulk field equations dictate that W does not increase as one approaches a\ncodimension-two source.\nImplications for the on-source curvature\nWe now show how the above matching conditions imply a dramatic cancelation in our key\nformula, eq. (2.4). In particular, after using Gauss' law to rewrite total derivatives in terms\nof surface terms at the position of the Gaussian pillboxes surrounding the sources, followed\nby eq. (2.31), one of the terms on the right-hand-side of eq.

Example: the axio-dilaton and 10D Type IIB supergravity\nOur goal in this section is to illustrate the generality of the result, eq. (2.41), obtained\nat the end of the last section. We use eq. (2.41) to show that the on-source curvature vanishes for F-theory axio-dilaton compactifications of 10D Type IIB supergravity with arbitrary\ncodimension-two sources, generalizing a known result when the sources are supersymmetric\n[24]. Although this example corresponds to the choices d = 8 and n = 2, - with only the\nmetric, gM N , and the axio-dilaton, \u03c4 = C + i e\u03c6 , (and no other fluxes) in play, in what follows\nwe work instead with general d.\nThis choice is made for three reasons. First, because it includes a broad class of explicitly\nknown solutions [23] with explicit sources: D7- and O7-planes, as well as various kinds of\n(p, q)-branes. Second, because the absence of bulk fluxes ensures that the right-hand-side of\neq. (2.4) is particularly simple (and is a total derivative). Third, the d-dimensional sources\nin this case have codimension two, which is one of the few situations for which matching\nconditions relating near-source asymptotics to physical properties of the source are explicitly\nworked out [15]. In particular, they have been tested explicitly [17] for the solutions of ref. [23]\nwith D7-brane sources - and implicitly, using SL(2, R) invariance, for (p, q)-brane sources\nas well.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\f3.1 Bulk equations\nThe Einstein frame action for the Einstein-axio-dilaton system in 10D Type IIB supergravity\nis S = SB + Ssource , where\n1\nSB = \u2212 2\n2\u03ba\n\nZ\n\n10\n\nd x\n\np\n\n\u2212\u011d \u011d\n\nMN\n\nThis is invariant under PSL(2,R) transformations\n\n\u0014\n\nR\u0302M N\n\n\u2202M \u03c4 \u2202N \u03c4\n+\n2 (Im \u03c4 )2\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(3.1)\n\na\u03c4 + b\n,\n(3.2)\nc\u03c4 + d\nwith the real parameters a through d satisfying a d \u2212 b c = 1.

This ensures that the warping contribution to\neq. (2.4) is never of the de Sitter sign.\n\nWe can now consider what happens if we do not neglect the logarithm, b1 ln \u03c1, in the\nwarping.

Conclusions\nIn summary, in this paper we examine solutions to extra-dimensional field equations for geometries of the form of eq. (1.1), with maximal symmetry in the noncompact dimensions. We\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fask what features of a solution control the curvature in the maximally symmetric, noncompact\ndimensions.\nOur main result is given by eq. (2.4), which gives the noncompact curvature scalar as a\nsum of four terms: R \u221d I + II + III + IV . Here I corresponds to the bulk action evaluated at\nthe appropriate back-reacted solution; II denotes an integral over a total derivative involving\n\nthe warp factor (whose sign is usually definite, and not de Sitter-like); III denotes the direct\ncontribution of the actions of any localized sources; and IV denotes a term which vanishes\nfor solutions that are maximally symmetric in the noncompact dimensions, in the absence of\nspace-filling fluxes.\nOur main new result is to show, for codimension-two sources, that the boundary conditions that must be satisfied near the sources relate the near-source asymptotics of the bulk\nfields in such a way that the contributions II and III precisely cancel.\nIn these circumstances eq. (2.4) degenerates down to eq. (2.41), which relates the curvature completely to the on-shell bulk action. Remarkably, it is very often true that this\non-shell action is also a total derivative. A sufficient condition for this turns out to be the\nexistence of a rigid scale invariance of the classical equations of motion [21], which in particular is present for most higher-dimensional supergravity theories of general interest. When\nSon\u2212shell is the integral of a total derivative, the curvature of the noncompact dimensions is\ncompletely determined by the asymptotic form of a particular combination of bulk fields near\nany sources that are distributed around the extra dimensions.\nThese arguments have two main implications. First, they show (at least for codimensiontwo sources) that source back-reaction and the source actions cannot be neglected when\nseeking de Sitter solutions. But they also show that all of the details of the complete backreacted solution are not required; it often suffices to know the asymptotic behaviour of the\nbulk fields in the near-source limit.\nWe explicitly derive which bulk fields play this role for 11D supergravity and 10D Type\nIIA and Type IIB supergravity, and we hope soon to have results to report on new kinds of\nexplicit extra-dimensional de Sitter solutions that can exploit the results we present here.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Ross Diener for helpful discussions, and the Abdus Salam International Centre for\nTheoretical Physics and Perimeter Institute for facilitating our collaboration on this project.\nCB also thanks the Niels Bohr International Academy for its hospitality in the final stages\nof this work.

Solutions to the 10D metric/axio-dilaton equations\nWe next briefly describe a situation where solutions are known fairly explicitly to the equations\ngoverning the metric and axio-dilaton in Type IIB supergravity. These are the unwarped, flat\nsolutions of ref. [23].\nFlat solutions\nWhen n = 2 a very broad class of explicit solutions to the Einstein equations are known [23]\nin the limiting case where the two transverse dimensions are not warped: \u2202m W = 0. In this\ncase the (\u03bc\u03bd) Einstein equation implies R = 0 and so the solutions are given by \u03c4 = \u03c4 (z) and\nds2 = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + e2C(z,z) dz dz .\n\n(C.1)\n\nA broad class of solutions to eq. (3.11) are immediate when \u2202m W = 0 [23]: it is satisfied\n \u0304 = 0. The transformation properties of\nby any holomorphic function, \u03c4 = \u03c4 (z), for which \u2202\u03c4\nthe axio-dilaton under the P SL(2, Z) subgroup of the P SL(2, R) symmetry are most easily\ntracked if \u03c4 (z) is written\nj(\u03c4 (z)) = P (z) ,\n\n(C.2)\n\nwhere j(\u03c4 ), is the standard bijection from the P SL(2, Z) fundamental domain, F, to the com-\n\nplex sphere, given in terms of Eisenstein modular forms, Ek (\u03c4 ), [27]. P (z) is a holomorphic\nfunction whose singularities are chosen by the properties of the source branes.\nThe singularities of the metric turn out to be just conical at positions, z = zi , where P (z)\nhas isolated poles. The metric turns out to be compact when P (z) is a ratio of polynomials\nof equal degree whose numerator has 24 zeroes, such as for the choice\nP (z) =\n\n4(24f )3\n,\n27g2 + 4f 3\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n(C.3)\n\n\fwith f (z) a polynomial of degree 8 and g(z) a polynomial of degree 12. This gives a compactification of Type IIB supergravity on CP 1 , corresponding to an F-theory reduction on\nK3 [24].\nThe metric function C(z, z) is found by solving Einstein's equations, giving\n2C(z,z)\n\ne\n\nN\nY\n(z \u2212 zi )\u22121/12\n= (Im \u03c4 ) \u03b7 (\u03c4 )\n\n2\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(C.4)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03b7(\u03c4 ) = q 1/24\n\nQ\n\nk (1\n\n\u2212 q k ), for q = e2\u03c0i\u03c4 , denotes the Dedekind \u03b7-function [27], and the\n\nproduct runs over the singularities of P (z).\n\nNotice that because the d-dimensional metric is flat for all of these solutions, eq. (3.12)\nshows that any sources must satisfy \u011d\u03bc\u03bd (\u03b4Ssource /\u03b4\u011d\u03bc\u03bd ) must vanish, at least when integrated\nover the Gaussian pillbox surrounding the source position. This turns out to be true, in\nparticular, when Ssource is the action of a D7-brane [17] or its image under SL(2, Z).\nFinally, the asymptotic form of \u03c4 (z) near the singularities may be found using the known\nproperties of j(\u03c4 ). In particular, for large Im \u03c4 , j(\u03c4 ) \u2243 e\u22122\u03c0i\u03c4 + * * * and so where P (z) \u2243\n\nci /(z \u2212 zi ) the above solution implies\n\n1\nln(z \u2212 zi ) + * * *\n2\u03c0i\nk\n\u2243 k Im \u03c4 \u2243 \u2212\nln |z \u2212 zi | + * * * ,\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c4 (z) \u2243\nand e2C(z,z)\n\n(C.5)\n\nas z \u2192 zi , for k a positive constant.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
