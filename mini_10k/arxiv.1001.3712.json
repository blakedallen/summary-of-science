When water is the minority component, preferential solvation can stabilize water domains\nenriched with ions. This ion-induced precipitation occurs in wide ranges of the temperature and\nthe average composition where the solvent would be in one-phase states without ions. The volume\nfraction of such water domains is decreased to zero as the interaction parameter \u03c7 (dependent on\nthe temperature) is decreased toward a critical value for each average composition.\nPACS numbers: 82.45.Gj, 61.20.Qg, 64.75.Cd, 81.16.Dn\n\nIn fluid mixtures containing water, phase separation\nbehavior can be drastically changed by a small amount\nof a salt [1]. More strikingly, many groups have observed long-lived heterogeneities (sometimes extending\nover a few micrometers) in one-phase states [2] and a\nthird phase visible as a thin plate at a liquid-liquid interface in two-phase states [3]. Very recently, mesophases\nwith lamellar or onion structures have been found for an\nantagonistic salt composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions [4]. Dramatic ion effects are ubiquitous in various\nsoft matters. For example, in polyelectrolytes, the phase\nbehavior sensitively depend on the degree of ionization\nand the composition for mixture solvents [5] and largescale heterogeneities have been observed [6]. In these\nphenomena, the solvation interaction among ions and\npolar molecules should play a major role together with\nthe Coulomb interaction among charges [7]. Recently\nsome theoretical efforts have been made to elucidate the\nsolvation effects in phase transitions in electrolytes and\npolyelectrolytes [8\u201310]. In this Letter, we consider hydrophilic monovalent ion pairs such as Na+ and Cl\u2212 in a\nbinary mixture of water and a less polar component (oil\nor alcohol) and examine ion-induced precipitation.\nNeglecting the electrostatic interaction but accounting\nfor the solvation interaction, we first consider a binary\nmixture in a cell with a fixed volume V . Here ions constitute the third component with density n(r). The volume\nfractions of water, oil, and ions are written as \u03c6(r) and\n\u03c6\u2032 (r), and vI n(r), respectively, where vI is the ionic volume. If the two solvent species have the same molecular\nvolume v0 , their densities are \u03c6/v0 and \u03c6\u2032 /v0 . The spacefilling condition reads \u03c6 + \u03c6\u2032 + vI n = 1. The ion volume\nfraction is assumed to be small or vI n \u226a 1, which is easily satisfied for small ions with vI \u226a v0 . In this Letter\nwe thus set \u03c6\u2032 = 1 \u2212 \u03c6, which simplifies the calculations.\nWhen the ions have a strong preference of water over\noil, we set up the free energy as\nF\n=\nT\n\nZ\n\ndr\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nf (\u03c6) C\n+ |\u2207\u03c6|2 + n ln(nv0 ) \u2212 gn\u03c6 ,\nT\n2\n\n(1)\n\nbe set equal to unity and then the temperature T represents the thermal energy of a particle. The free energy\ndensity f (\u03c6) is taken to be the simple form,\nv0 f /T = \u03c6 ln \u03c6 + (1 \u2212 \u03c6) ln(1 \u2212 \u03c6) + \u03c7\u03c6(1 \u2212 \u03c6),\n\nwhere \u03c7 is the interaction parameter dependent on T and\nits mean-field critical value is 2 without ions. We fix the\ntotal particle numbers of the three components as\nZ\nZ\nn\u0304 = drn/V, \u03c6\u0304 = dr\u03c6/V,\n(3)\nIn equilibrium the homogeneity of the ion chemical potential \u03b4F/\u03b4n yields\nn = n\u0304eg\u03c6 /heg\u03c6 i,\n\n(4)\n\nR\nwhere heg\u03c6 i = dreg\u03c6 /V is the space average of eg\u03c6 .\nSubstitution of Eq.(4) into F in Eq.(1) gives\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nf (\u03c6) C\nF\n2\n= dr\n+ |\u2207\u03c6| + V n\u0304 ln[n\u0304v0 /heg\u03c6 i].

Around a planar interface varying\nalong the z axis, we obtain T C(d\u03c6/dz)2 = 2H(\u03c6), where\nH(\u03c6) = f (\u03c6) \u2212 f (\u03c6\u03b1 ) \u2212 T (n \u2212 n\u03b1 ) \u2212 h(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u03b1 ).\n\n(7)\n\nWe suppose coexistence of a water-rich phase \u03b1 and an\noil-rich phase \u03b2 with \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c6\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03b2 > 0. The compositions and the ion densities in the two phases are written\nas \u03c6\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b2 , n\u03b1 , and n\u03b2 , respectively. The volume fraction\nof the phase \u03b1 is denoted by \u03b3\u03b1 . Since that of the phase\n\u03b2 is \u03b3\u03b2 = 1 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b1 , we have\n\u03b3\u03b1 = (\u03c6\u0304 \u2212 \u03c6\u03b2 )/\u2206\u03c6 = (n\u0304 \u2212 n\u03b2 )/\u2206n,\n\nwhere C is a positive constant and g is a positive parameter representing the ion preference of water.

Outside the spinodal curve without ions, we notice dG/d\u03c6 =\n\nwhere \u03b3\u03b1 \u2192 0 as \u03c7 \u2192 \u03c7p .\nTo easily understand the mathematics, let us focus on\nthe case \u03b3\u03b1 \u226a 1, where f\u03b1 \u223c\n= f (\u03c6\u0304) \u2212 f\u03b2\u2032 (1 \u2212\n= 0 and f\u03b2 \u223c\n\u03c6\u0304)\u03b3\u03b1 in Eq.(9). Treating \u03b3\u03b1 as an order parameter, we\nwrite the deviation \u2206F = F (\u03b3\u03b1 )\u2212F (0) of the free energy\nfrom the one-phase value F (0) as\n\u2206F /T V \u223c\n= A1 \u03b3\u03b1 \u2212 n\u0304 log(1 + B1 \u03b3\u03b1 ),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere A1 = v0\u22121 G(\u03c6\u0304) + n\u0304g(1 \u2212 \u03c6\u0304) and B1 = eg\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 1 \u223c\n=\neg\u2206\u03c6 . For w \u2261 n\u0304B1 /A1 > 1, \u2206F has a negative minimum\ngiven by \u2212T V A1 (w log w \u2212 w + 1)/B1 < 0 attained at\n\u03b3\u03b1 = (w \u2212 1)/B1 \u223c\n= v0 n\u0304/G(\u03c6\u0304) \u2212 e\u2212g(1\u2212\u03c6\u0304) ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhich is consistent with Eq.(14) in the limit \u03c6\u03b2 \u2192 \u03c6\u0304.\nThe condition w > 1 is equivalent to \u03c7 > \u03c7p for g \u226b 1.\nFigure 1 gives the phase diagrams in the \u03c6-\u03c7 plane\nwith n\u0304 = 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 v0\u22121 and g = 11. In the first case of\n\u03c6\u0304 = 0.35, \u03c6\u03b1 changes continuously and is minimum at\n\u03c7 = 2.05, where \u03c7p = 0.687 and the maximum of n\u03b1 is\n0.381v0\u22121 at \u03c7 = \u03c7p . In the second case of \u03c6\u0304 = 0.46,\nwhere \u03c7p = 1.834 and n\u03b1 = 0.0842v0\u22121 at \u03c7 = \u03c7p , we\nfind that \u03c6\u03b1 changes discontinuously along a hysteresis\nloop in the range 1.953 < \u03c7 < 1.967. In equilibrium, F\nis minimized and the resultant discontinuous transition\n\n\f3\nis at \u03c7 = 1.957. In Fig.2, we display curves of \u03c7 = \u03c7p (\u03c6\u0304)\nfor three values of n\u0304 with g = 10. Each curve assumes a\nminimum at small \u03c6\u0304 far away from the coexistence curve\nwithout ions. With increasing \u03c6\u0304, the precipitation branch\nshrinks and disappears as \u03c6\u0304 \u2192 \u03c6p , where \u03c6p is a critical\ncomposition less than 0.5. As functions of \u03c6\u0304 and \u03c7, we\nshow \u03b3\u03b1 in Fig.3 in the continuous case of g = 10 and \u03c6\u03b1\nin Fig.4 in the discontinuous case of g = 11.\nWithout the electrostatic interaction, the surface tension\nof our system is expressed as the integral \u03c3 =\nR\ndzCT (d\u03c6/dz)2 around an interface varying along the\nz axis [8]. Use of Eq.(7) gives\n1/2\n\n\u03c3 = (2CT )\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6\u03b1\n\nd\u03c6H(\u03c6)1/2 ,\n\n(18)\n\n\u03c6\u03b2\n\nwhere C is assumed to be a constant. In Fig.5, we display\nthe function [2H(\u03c6)v0 /T ]1/2 for g = 11.

We obtain \u03c6\u03b1 = 0.993 and n\u03b1 = 0.352v0\u22121 within\nthe droplet and \u03c6\u03b2 = 0.349 and n\u03b2 = 2.55 \u00d7 10\u22124 v0\u22121\noutside it. In Fig.6, the potential \u03a6(r) relaxes with the\nDebye length \u03ba\u22121\n\u03b2 = 11.8a and is well fitted to the onedimensional solution of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann\nequation (dotted line) with \u2206\u03a6 = 3T /e [8]. Here n\u03b1 and\nn\u03b2 are the bulk values of n = n1 + n2 .\nIn future we should explain the experimental findings\nof large-scale heterogeneities [2]. We note that one-phase\nstates are metastable outside the spinodal curve with ions\n(\u03c7 < 1/2\u03c6\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03c6\u0304) \u2212 g 2 v0 n\u0304/2) in Fig.1. Thus precipitation\nfrom a one-phase state should be triggered by some impurities and/or hydrophilic walls. We also note that the\nwetting transition of aqueous mixtures is much influenced\nby the ion-induced precipitation mechanism.\nExperiments are informative, where the temperature,\nthe water volume fraction, and the salt amount are varied. We mention an experiment by Leunissen et al.\n[13], where micron-sized water droplets containing ions\nformed a crystal in an oil with low dielectric constant\n(\u03b5oil = 4 \u2212 10) without a surfactant. Graaf et al. [14]\nascribed its origin to the screened Coulomb interaction\namong droplets. We also propose experiments of the\nsalting-out effect of polyelectrolytes in water-alcohol [5],\nwhere the degree of ionization much increases with accumulation of water around the polymers [10].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific\nResearch on Priority Area \"Soft Matter Physics\" from\nthe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and\nTechnology of Japan.\n\n(Academic Press, London, 1991).\n[8] A.
