Among manifolds\nof special holonomy, the holonomy groups G2 in seven dimensions and Spin(7) in eight\ndimensions are exceptional ones. Recently compactification of M theory on G2 manifold has been discussed extensively in connection with N = 1 supersymmetric gauge\ntheory in four dimensions [1],[2],[3],[4],[5]. Though it is less studied, the geometry of\nSpin(7) manifold is relevant to three dimensional N = 1 Yang-Mills theory. Manifolds\nof exceptional holonomy with branes wrapping on a supersymmetric cycle are also useful\nfor establishing the gravity/gauge theory correspondence that generalizes the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. In addition to few basic examples of G2 and Spin(7) metrics on the\ntotal space of vector bundles [6],[7], we now have an increasing list of explicit metrics\n[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[13],[14]. All these examples are metrics on non-compact manifolds\nand of cohomogeneity one. There is a (rigid) supersymmetric cycle and the non-compact\nmanifold may be identified as the normal bundle of the supersymmetric cycle. In studying the dynamics of supersymmetric compactifications of superstring and M theory, we\nare especially interested in the behavior when the manifold develops singularities. Potentially there are various types of singularities, but an important class of singularities\nin supersymmetric dynamics is the isolated conical singularity that arises when a supersymmetric cycle is shrinking. In such cases the stringy geometry is believed to be\ngoverned by a tubular neighborhood of the singularity or the shrinking supersymetric\ncycle, where the above explicit metrics on the normal bundle are available. Furthermore,\nthe geometry of such metrics often shows some universal feature that is independent of\nthe way singularities or supersymmetric cycles are embedded in a manifold of special\nholonomy. The geometry of ADE singularities in K3 surface and the conifold transition in Calabi-Yau threefold are typical examples and we expect it is also the case with\nexceptional holonomy.\nLet us review the basic geometry of manifolds of cohomogeneity one, following [15],\n[16], [17]. A Riemannian manifold (M, g) is called cohomogeneity one, if there is an\nisometric action on M of a Lie group G with generic orbit of codimension one. The generic\norbit G/K is called principal orbit. There is an open interval I in real numbers with\nf := I \u00d7 G/K is an open dense subset in M. The compliment\ncoordinate t, such that M\n\n1\n\n\ff consists of singular orbits of lower dimensions, where we have a larger isotropy\nof M\n\nsubgroup H, (K \u2282 H \u2282 G). A tubular neighborhood of the singular orbit Q = G/H\n\nis diffeomorphic to an open disk bundle of the normal bundle of Q. Then the principal\norbits are the hypersurfaces which are the sphere bundles over Q. This means H/K\nis diffeomorphic to a sphere S k . Thus, as the radius of the sphere tends to zero, the\nprincipal orbits collapse to the singular orbit. Furthermore, the existence of a smooth\ncomplete metric on the normal bundle implies that the singular orbit must be a minimal\nsubmanifold. We see the metric of cohomogeneity one is well suited for describing the\ngeometry of collapsing supersymmetric cycles by identifying its normal bundle with a\nmanifold of cohomogeneity one. To find out explicit metrics we begin with the fact that\nf the metric g takes the following form;\non M\n\ng = dt2 + gt ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere the interval I becomes a geodesic line. For each fixed \"time\" t, gt is a homogeneous\nmetric of the principal orbit G/K. Hence if we assume that the metric is of cohomogeneity one, the condition of Ricci-flatness, or the Einstein equation in general, is reduced\nto a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations with respect to the transverse\ncoordinate t to the principal orbit.\nIn this paper we consider eight dimensional metrics of cohomogeneity one with the\nprincipal orbit SU(3)/U(1). Part of our analysis is quite parallel to the case with the\nprincipal orbit Sp(2)/Sp(1) which has been worked out in [10], but there is a new feature\nthat arises from the Weyl group symmetry \u03a33 = W (SU(3)). We shall pay attention to\nthis symmetry. In section two we derive a first order system of non linear differential\nequations from the octonionic self-duality of the spin connection. If we choose vielbein\n(or metric ansatz) appropriately, the octonionic self-duality of the spin connection implies\nan existence of covariantly constant four form which characterizes Spin(7) holonomy. We\nalso show that there is a superpotential which implies the first order system. In section\nthree we present special solutions which give asymptotically locally conical (ALC) [10]\nmetrics. Our ansatz for special solution was motivated by the one in [13]. Compared\nwith ALC solutions in [10] and [13], our solution takes more general form to keep the\nWeyl group \u03a33 symmetry manifest. The singular orbit of SU(3)/U(1) model is the\ncomplex projective space CP(2) = SU(3)/U(2) which is self-dual Einstein but not spin.\nThis is in a sharp difference from the Sp(2)/Sp(1) case whose singular orbit is the four\n2\n\n\fdimensional sphere S 4 = Sp(2)/Sp(1) \u00d7 Sp(1) which is self-dual Einstein and spin [6].\nThus the issue of global topology is more subtle in our case. We make a perturbative\nanalysis around the singular orbit in section four and find one more parameter in addition\nto the scale parameter in the explicit ALC solutions in section three. This additional\nparameter is an evidence for the existence of non-trivial deformation of our ALC metrics\nand numerical simulations support it. In section five we discuss the global topology that\ndepends on a choice of the embedding of U(1) subalgebra. In general the fiber over the\nsingular orbit CP(2) is the Lens space S 3 /Zn which leads to orbifold singularities. But\nthere is a particular choice of U(1) embedding which is free from orbifold singularities.\nWith this choice of U(1) subalgebra, our ALC solution gives a new Spin(7) metric on\na vector bundle over CP(2). Finally section six is devoted to the construction of L2 normalisable harmonic 4-forms in the background of ALC metrics, which we can employ\nin constructing supersymmetric M2-branes [9],[10],[11].\n\n2\n\nOctonionic Instanton Equation\n\nWe consider an eight dimensional metric of cohomogeneity one with the principal orbit\nSU(3)/U(1). It is convenient to describe homogeneous metric in terms of the MaurerCartan forms of SU(3). The Maurer-Cartan equation is presented in Appendix A. We\ntake a basis TA , TB of the Cartan part and \u03c31,2 , \u03a31,2 , \u03c41,2 of non-Cartan part. The Weyl\ngroup of SU(3) is the permutation group \u03a33 and our basis is chosen so that the MarterCartan eqaution exhibits \u03a33 symmetry. The isotropy representation of SU(3)/U(1) is\ndecomposed as\nsu(3)/u(1) = p1 \u2295 p2 \u2295 p3 \u2295 p4 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere pi (i = 1 \u223c 4) are irreducible U(1)-modules with dim p1 = dim p2 = dim p3 = 2\nand dim p4 = 1. Our metric ansatz is diagonal with respect to (2.1) for all t ;\ng = dt2 + a(t)2 (\u03c312 + \u03c322 ) + b(t)2 (\u03a321 + \u03a322 ) + c(t)2 (\u03c412 + \u03c422 ) + f (t)2 TA2 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nWe have taken a quotient by the U(1) subgroup generated by TB . The vielbein of the\nabove metric is\ne0 = dt ,\n\ne1 = a(t)\u03c31 ,\n\ne4 = b(t)\u03a32 ,\n\ne2 = a(t)\u03c32 ,\n\ne5 = c(t)\u03c41 ,\n\ne3 = b(t)\u03a31 ,\n\ne6 = c(t)\u03c42 ,\n3\n\ne7 = f (t)TA .\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fThe spin connection \u03c9ab is obtained from the condition Dea = dea + \u03c9ab \u2227 eb = 0. We\nconsider the octonionic self-duality of the spin connection\n1\n\u03c9ab = \u03a8abcd \u03c9cd ,\n2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere totally anti-symmetric tensor \u03a8abcd is defined by the structure constants of octonions \u03c8abc as follows;\n\u03a8abc0 = \u03c8abc , (1 \u2264 a, b, c, * * * \u2264 7)\n1\n\u03a8abcd = \u2212 \u01ebabcdef g \u03c8ef g .\n3!\n\n(2.5)\n\nIt can be shown that (2.4) implies the four form defined by\n\u03a9=\n\n1\n\u03a8abcd ea \u2227 eb \u2227 ec \u2227 ed .\n4!\n\n(2.6)\n\nis closed and the metric has Spin(7) holonomy [18]. Explicitly the octonionic instanton\nequation in the present case is given by the structure constants1 ;\n\u03c8abc = +1 ,\n\nfor (abc) = (721), (641), (135), (254), (263), (374), (765) .\n\n(2.7)\n\nWe obtain the following first order differential equations;\n\u0227\na\n\u1e03\nb\n\u010b\nc\nf \u0307\nf\n\nb2 + c2 \u2212 a2\nf\n\u2212 \u03b1A 2 ,\nabc\na\n2\n2\n2\nc +a \u2212b\nf\n=\n\u2212 \u03b2A 2 ,\nabc\nb\n2\n2\n2\na +b \u2212c\nf\n=\n\u2212 \u03b3A 2 ,\nabc\nc\nf\nf\nf\n= \u03b1A 2 + \u03b2A 2 + \u03b3A 2 ,\na\nb\nc\n=\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere the parameters \u03b1A , \u03b2A , \u03b3A appearing in the Maurer-Cartan equation of TA satisfy\nthe \"traceless\" condition \u03b1A + \u03b2A + \u03b3A = 0. These parameters have to be rational for\nthe U(1) subgroup generated by TB to be a closed subgroup (see also section 5). We\nassume this condition required by topological consistency in the following. Then there\n1\n\nAn appropriate permutation of the indices and the overall parity (sign) change are necessary to match\n\nour convention to the standard one. This parity change is an analogue of the exchange of self-duality\nand anti-self-duality in four dimensions and related to the orientation of the manifold.\n\n4\n\n\f\u2212\nexists an integer N so that (\u03b1A , \u03b2A , \u03b3A ) = (1/N)(n1 , n2 , n3 ) and \u2192\nn := (n1 , n2 , n3 ) are\nintegers with no common divisor. Since N is eliminated by the rescaling f \u2212\u2192 Nf ,\nwe may assume (\u03b1A , \u03b2A , \u03b3A ) = (n1 , n2 , n3 ) without any loss of generality. Our Spin(7)\ngravitational instanton equation is manifestly symmetric under the permutation group\n\u03a33 = W (SU(3)), which can be regarded as the Weyl group of SU(3).\nWe can also derive the octonionic instanton equation (2.8) from the Lagrangian formulation. In the description of the extrinsic geometry of hypersurface, the shape operator\nf satisfies the equation [17]\nL of the principal orbit SU(3)/U(1) \u2282 M\n\ng \u0307t = 2gt \u25e6 L .\n\n(2.9)\n\nFor the metric (2.2) it has a diagonal form,\n!\n\n\u0227 \u0227 \u1e03 \u1e03 \u010b \u010b f \u0307\n.\nL(t) = diag\n, , , , , ,\na a b b c c f\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe Ricci-flatness condition then becomes [17]\nL\u0307 + (trL)L \u2212 Ric = 0 ,\n\n(2.11)\n\ntrL\u0307 + tr(L2 ) = 0 ,\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere Ric denotes the Ricci curvature of the metric gt on SU(3)/U(1). The equation\n(2.11) expresses the Ricci-flatness condition in directions tangent to the principal orbit,\nwhile (2.12) is obtained by considering the normal direction, i.e., t-direction.

The overall normalizations are fixed\nby the requirement that we can make a quadrature of the differential equation for f (r)\nto obtain\nf 2 (r) =\n\n(r \u2212 \u03b11 )(r \u2212 \u03b21 )(r \u2212 \u03b31 )\n.\n(r \u2212 \u03b12 )(r \u2212 \u03b22 )(r \u2212 \u03b32 )\n\n(3.2)\n\nSince f (r) \u223c constant as r \u2192 \u221e in our ansatz, asymptotically there is an S 1 of a constant\nradius at infinity. Thus solutions obtained by this ansatz will give ALC (asymptotically\nlocally conical) metrics in the sense of [10]. We find that if the parameters obey\n\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 = 2n1 ,\n\n\u03b21 \u2212 \u03b22 = 2n2 ,\n\n\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b32 = 2n3 ,\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u03b11 + \u03b21 = 2\u03b32 ,\n\n\u03b21 + \u03b31 = 2\u03b12 ,\n\n\u03b31 + \u03b11 = 2\u03b22 ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nand\n\nthen the ansatz (3.1) gives a Spin(7) gravitational instanton. We have expressed the\nconditions in a completely \u03a33 symmetric manner. Note that due to the constraint n1 +\nn2 + n3 = 0, one of the six conditions is redundant and we have one free parameter\nthat corresponds to a translation of the radial coordinate r. After rescaling the radial\ncoordinate r \u2192 r/l by an arbitrary positive parameter l with dimensions of length, our\nALC solutions can be written as\na2 (r) = (r \u2212 \u03b11 l)(r \u2212 \u03b12 l),\nb2 (r) = (r \u2212 \u03b21 l)(r \u2212 \u03b22 l),\nc2 (r) = (r \u2212 \u03b31 l)(r \u2212 \u03b32 l),\n(r \u2212 \u03b11 l)(r \u2212 \u03b21 l)(r \u2212 \u03b31 l)\nf 2 (r) = l2\n(r \u2212 \u03b12 l)(r \u2212 \u03b22 l)(r \u2212 \u03b32 l)\n\n(3.5)\n\nwith the conditions (3.3) and (3.4). The asymptotic form of the metric is\ng \u223c dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a96 + l2 TA2 ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere d\u03a96 is a homogeneous metric on the flag manifold SU(3)/U(1) \u00d7 U(1), which is\nthe twister space of CP(2).\nLet us look at a few special examples, where a cancellation of a zero and a pole of\nthe rational function f 2 takes place.\n\u2212\n1. \u2192\nn = (1, \u22121, 0)\n7\n\n\fIn this case we can take \u03b31 = \u03b32 = 0 by a translation of r. Then the solution is\na2 (r) = (r \u2212 4l/3)(r + 2l/3) ,\nb2 (r) = (r + 4l/3)(r \u2212 2l/3),\n\n(3.7)\n\nc2 (r) = r 2 ,\n(r \u2212 4l/3)(r + 4l/3)\n.\nf 2 (r) = l2\n(r + 2l/3)(r \u2212 2l/3)\nThe solution has the same structure2 as new G2 metrics in [13] based on S 3 \u00d7 S 3 .\nThe metric is regular in the region r > 4l/3. At the boundary a2 \u2192 0, f 2 \u2192 0\nbut b2 = c2 = 16l2 /9. Since b2 and c2 approach the same boundary value, we have\nCP(2) as a singular orbit (see the next section).\n\u2212\n2. \u2192\nn = (1, 1, \u22122)\nIn this case \u03b1i = \u03b2i has to be satisfied and we obtain a reduced solution with\na2 = b2 . We take \u03b11 = \u03b21 = 1. Then the solution is\na2 (r) = (r \u2212 l)(r + l) ,\nb2 (r) = a2 (r),\n\n(3.8)\n\nc2 (r) = (r + 3l)(r \u2212 l) ,\n(r \u2212 l)(r + 3l)\nf 2 (r) = l2\n.\n(r + l)2\nWe see the solution has the same form as the simplest solution (denoted A8 ) among\nnew Spin(7) metrics in [10]. The metric is regular in the region r > l and at r = l\nall the coefficients are linearly vanishing. Thus the principal orbit SU(3)/U(1)\ncollapses to a point and the manifold has curvature singularities at r = l, since\nSU(3)/U(1) is not homeomorphic to S 7 .\n\u2212\n3. \u2192\nn = (2, \u22121, \u22121)\nThis is obtained from the second example simply by the sign flip and a permutation,\nbut the global topology is different as we will see shortly. In the same way as above\n2\n\nIt is only at the level of solutions to the first order system and does not mean the geometry is the\n\nsame, since the starting coset space is different.\n\n8\n\n\fthe solution is\na2 (r) = (r \u2212 3l)(r + l) ,\nb2 (r) = (r \u2212 l)(r + l),\n\n(3.9)\n\nc2 (r) = b2 (r) ,\n(r + l)(r \u2212 3l)\nf 2 (r) = l2\n.\n(r \u2212 l)2\nThe regular region is r > 3l and in contrast to the second example we have CP(2)\nwith finite volume at the boundary. This solution corresponds to the solution\ndenoted B8 in [10].\n\n4\n\nPerturbation around the singular orbit\n\nIn this section we will give a perturbative expansion in a small neighborhood of the singular orbit (t = 0) for the Spin(7) gravitational instanton equation (2.8). A mathematical\nfoundation may be found in [17]. Our metric is written in the form g = dt2 + gt , where\ngt (t \u2265 0) is a one-parameter family of SU(3)-invariant metrics on the principal orbit\nSU(3)/U(1). We assume that near the boundary t = 0 the orbit is locally of the form\nSU(3)/U(1) \u2212\u2192 S 3 \u00d7 SU(3)/U(2) ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere S 3 denotes a round 3-sphere whose radius tends to zero at t = 0, and the singular\norbit SU(3)/U(2) is a complex projective space CP(2) whose size remains non-vanishing\nat t = 0. Thus, if we choose the rate of collapse of the S 3 factor appropriately, the\nmanifold approaches R4 \u00d7 CP(2) at short distance; it has topologically the same local\nbehavior as the hyperk\u00e4hler manifold T \u2217 CP(2). In general a singular orbit gives a\nsingularity of the instanton equation and we have no smooth solution at the singularity.\nHowever, in our case, the very geometric nature of the equation allows a smooth solution\nin a neighborhood around a singular orbit.\nDue to the \u03a33 -symmetry of our instanton equation, we have three types of possible\nboundary conditions for the limit t \u2192 0:\ng \u2212\u2192 dt2 + t2 (TA2 /n21 + \u03c312 + \u03c322 ) + m2 (\u03a321 + \u03a322 + \u03c412 + \u03c422 ),\n\n(4.2)\n\ng \u2212\u2192 dt2 + t2 (TA2 /n22 + \u03a321 + \u03a322 ) + m2 (\u03c312 + \u03c322 + \u03c412 + \u03c422 ),\n\n(4.3)\n\ng \u2212\u2192 dt2 + t2 (TA2 /n23 + \u03c412 + \u03c422 ) + m2 (\u03c312 + \u03c322 + \u03a321 + \u03a322 ),\n\n(4.4)\n\n9\n\n\fwhere m is a scale parameter corresponding to the size of CP(2). By choosing a boundary condition the \u03a33 -symmetry is broken to the Z2 symmetry. For each choice of the\nboundary condition which specifies a CP(2) embedded in SU(3)/U(1), the unit volume\n\u2192\nelement \u2212\nv \u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1, 2, 3) of the CP(2) is given by\n\u2212\n\u2192\nv 1 = e3 \u2227 e4 \u2227 e5 \u2227 e6 ,\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\nv 2 = e1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 e5 \u2227 e6 ,\n\n\u2212\n\u2192\nv 3 = e1 \u2227 e2 \u2227 e3 \u2227 e4 ,\n\n(4.5)\n\nrespectively. For all three cases the calibration \u03a9 given by (2.6) satisfies the equation\n\u2192\n|\u03a9(\u2212\nv )| = 1. We therefore see that the singular orbit CP(2) appearing at the boundary\n\u03b1\n\nis a Cayley submanifold (supersymmetric four-cycles) in Spin(7) holonomy manifold.\nThe solutions with these three boundary conditions and the corresponding CP(2)'s\nare permuted by the action of \u03a33 . For concreteness, we will consider from now on the\nfirst boundary condition (4.2). The quantity \u03a321 + \u03a322 + \u03c412 + \u03c422 represents the FubiniStudy metric on CP(2) and TA2 /n21 + \u03c312 + \u03c322 locally the metric on the unit 3-sphere.\nMore precisely the metric g would have an orbifold singularity at t = 0 unless we choose\n\u2192\nthe value of \u2212\nn appropriately, since the latter represents the metric on the Lens space\nS 3 /Zn in general rather than S 3 globally (see the next section). The perturbative series\nexpansion around the singular orbit CP(2) yields\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1\na(t) = t 1 \u2212 (Q + 1)(t/m)2 + * * * ,\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\nb(t) = m 1 + (4 \u2212 n2 /n1 )(t/m) + * * * ,\n6\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n2\nc(t) = m 1 + (4 \u2212 n3 /n1 )(t/m) + * * * ,\n6\n\u0011\nt \u0010\nf (t) =\n1 + Q(t/m)2 + * * * .\nn1\n\n(4.6)\n\nIt should be noticed that the solution is not uniquely determined by the boundary condition and it includes an additional free parameter Q. The expansion (4.6) is a consequence\nof the assumption (4.2) and valid for any solution that is smooth around the singular\norbit. However, it is not at all clear that the local perturbative solution (4.6) can be\nextended to a global complete metric. There should be some bound on Q that may\n\u2192\ndepend on a choice of \u2212\nn . One can obtain an example of local solution that extends to a\n\u2212\ncomplete metric by setting \u2192\nn = (1, 1, \u22122)3 and Q = \u22122/3. Then it can be extended to\n3\n\n\u2212\nWith this choice of \u2192\nn the ALC solution cannot have a singular orbit with finite volume (see the\n\nsecond example in section 3).\n\n10\n\n\fthe Calabi hyperk\u00e4hler metric on T \u2217 CP(2) of Sp(2) holonomy [9],[15];\n1\na (r) = (r 2 \u2212 m2 ),\n2\n2\n\n1\nb (r) = (r 2 + m2 ),\n2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nc (r) = r ,\n\nr2\nf (r) = (1 \u2212 (m/r)4 ) (4.7)\n4\n2\n\nwith dt = dr/(1 \u2212 (m/r)4 )1/2 . Note that the asymptotic behavior of the Calabi metric\nat infinity is different from the ALC metrics.\nWe can also find the specialization which reproduces the ALC metrics described in the\nprevious section. Let us consider the solution (3.5) whose radial coordinate is constrained\nto be r \u2265 \u03b11 l. From the conditions (3.3) and (3.4) we have\n4\n2\n\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b21 = (n1 \u2212 n2 ), \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b22 = (n1 \u2212 n3 ),\n3\n3\n2\n4\n\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b31 = (n1 \u2212 n3 ), \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b32 = (n1 \u2212 n2 ).\n3\n3\n\u2192\nThus if we choose the parameter \u2212\nn as\n\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 = 2n1 ,\n\nn1 > 0,\n\nn1 > n2 ,\n\nn1 > n3 ,\n\n(4.8)\n\n(4.9)\n\nthen the solution {a, b, c, f } is non-vanishing in the region r > \u03b11 l, and so the ALC\nmetric is non-singular. The behavior of the metric near r = \u03b11 l is given by\ng \u2212\u2192 d\u03c12 + \u03c12 (TA2 /n21 + \u03c312 + \u03c322 ) + l2 (\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b21 )(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b22 )(\u03a321 + \u03a322 + \u03c412 + \u03c422 ),\n\n(4.10)\n\nq\n\nwhere \u03c12 = l(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )(r \u2212 \u03b11 l). Setting m = l (\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b21 )(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b22 ), we reproduce the\nequation (4.2) and higher order calculations yield the relation\nQ=\u2212\n\n2\n(13 + 2n2 n3 /n21 ).\n27\n\n(4.11)\n\nThe parameter in the perturbative solution Q implies a possibility of non-trivial deformations of the ALC solutions (3.5). Although we have not been able to find general solutions in closed form, numerical simulations of the instanton equation indicate\na family of global solutions under some conditions of Q. For example, in the case of\n\u2192\n\u2212\nn = (1, \u22121, 0), the condition is given by Q \u2264 \u22120.35 approximately and the exact solution (3.7) with Q = \u221226/27 is included in this region. The existence of more general\nsolutions is also supported by a similar analysis for the coset space Sp(2)/Sp(1), where\nthe general solutions of complete metric have been obtained [10]. In Appendix B it is\nshown briefly how we can accommodate a local perturbative analysis around the singular\norbit of Sp(2)/Sp(1) model to the global solutions in [10].\n11\n\n\f5\n\nThe issue of global topology\n\nLet us consider the global topology of solutions with boundary condition (4.2) by calculating explicitly the 1-forms \u03c31 , \u03c32 and TA describing the metric on the unit 3-sphere S 3\nlocally. Our calculation shows that near the boundary the topology of the principal orbit\nis in general S 3 /Zn1 \u00d7 CP(2) rather than S 3 \u00d7 CP(2). The integer n1 comes in here\nsince we take the first boundary condition (4.2). For other boundary conditions (4.3)\nand (4.4), n1 is replaced by n2 or n3 accordingly.\nTo consider the topology of the fiber over a point of the base space CP(2) we fix the\ncoordinates on CP(2). Then \u03a3i = \u03c4j = 0 on the fiber and the SU(3) Maurer-Cartan\nequation reduces to the following form;\nd\u03c31 = \u03baA TA \u2227 \u03c32 + \u03baB TB \u2227 \u03c32 ,\nd\u03c32 = \u2212\u03baA TA \u2227 \u03c31 \u2212 \u03baB TB \u2227 \u03c31 ,\n\n(5.1)\n\ndTA = 2\u03b1A \u03c31 \u2227 \u03c32 ,\ndTB = 2\u03b1B \u03c31 \u2227 \u03c32 .\nIn fact this Maurer-Cartan equation comes from the following choice of the generators\nE\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1, 2 or A, B) of U(2);\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n000\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n00 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nE1 = \uf8ec 0 0 1 \uf8f7 , E2 = \uf8ec 0 0 \u2212i \uf8f7 , EA = \u2212\n010\n\n0i 0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b1B 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b1A 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n1 \uf8ec\n1 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 \u03b2B 0 \uf8f7 , EB =\n\uf8ec 0 \u03b2A 0 \uf8f7 .

For example the Calabi metric which has \u2212\nn = (1, 1, \u22122) is a hyperk\u00e4hler\nmetric on T \u2217 CP(2) with a fiber C2 = R4 . Concerning the examples of ALC solutions\n\u2192\nin section 3, the solution (3.7) with \u2212\nn = (1, \u22121, 0) has a trivial fiber R4 , while the\n\u2192\n\u2192\nfiber of the solution (3.9) with \u2212\nn = (2, \u22121, \u22121) is R4 /Z . By the constraint (4.9) on \u2212\nn,\n2\n\namong our ALC solutions (3.5) only the solution (3.7) gives a complete metric of Spin(7)\nholonomy without orbifold singularities.\n\nL2-normalisable harmonic 4-forms\n\n6\n\nIn this section we consider L2 -normalisable harmonic 4-forms on ALC manifolds of\nSpin(7) holonomy. For the metric (2.2) of cohomogeneity one, we assume the following self-dual 4-form G ;\nG = u1 (t)(e0567 + e1243 ) + u2 (t)(e0473 + e2561 ) + u3 (t)(e0127 + e3654 )\n+ u4 (t)(e0315 + e4267 + e0524 + e6371 + e0461 + e7325 + e0362 + e5471 ),\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere eabcd = ea \u2227 eb \u2227 ec \u2227 ed . If uA = 1 for all A, then the 4-form G is equal to the\ncalibration \u03a9. The closedness condition dG = 0 is expressed by the equations,\nd 2 2\n(a b u1 ) = 4abcu4 \u2212 2n1 f b2 u2 \u2212 2n2 f a2 u3 ,\ndt\nd 2 2\n(a c u2 ) = 4abcu4 \u2212 2n1 f c2 u1 \u2212 2n3 f a2 u3 ,\ndt\nd 2 2\n(b c u3 ) = 4abcu4 \u2212 2n2 f c2 u1 \u2212 2n3 f b2 u2 ,\ndt\nd\n(abcf u4 ) = f (a2 u3 + b2 u2 + c2 u1 ).\ndt\n\n(6.2)\n\nThe instanton equation leads to a linear relation as the first integral\nu1 + u2 + u3 + 4u4 = k,\n\n(6.3)\n\nwhere the constant k should be chosen to zero by the L2 -normalisability of the 4-form\nG. This choice is also consistent with the criterions for unbroken supersymmetry5 for\ncompactifications of M theory on manifolds of Spin(7) holonomy [20];\n\u2217 G = G,\n5\n\n\u03c9 = 0,\n\nG \u2227 \u03a9 = 0,\n\nWe thank Katrin Becker for pointing out an error in the original version.\n\n14\n\n(6.4)\n\n\fwhere \u03c9 is the 2-form defined by \u03c9 = Gabcd \u03a8abcf ed \u2227 ef . In fact our ansatz satisfies\n\u2217G = G, \u03c9 = 0 automatically and the last equation requires precisely the relation (6.3)\nwith k = 0. Thus following [8],[9],[10], one can construct supersymmetric M2-branes\nusing the L2 -normalisable solutions of (6.2).\nIn order to obtain explicit solutions of (6.2), we take the ALC solution (3.7) as\nthe background metric.

Let us write the Spin(7) metric in the form\ng = dt2 + a(t)2 (\u03a321 + \u03a322 ) + b(t)2 \u03c3 2 + c(t)2 (\u03c412 + \u03c422 + \u03c432 + \u03c442 ).\n\n(B.1)\n\nHere {\u03a3a , \u03c3, \u03c4i } are one-forms defined by using the Maurer- Cartan forms of Sp(2) [10]\nand {a, b, c} are functions of the radial variable t associated with the decomposition of\nthe isotropy representation sp(2)/sp(1) = p1 \u2295 p2 \u2295 p3 with dimensions 2, 1 and 4,\nrespectively.

Thus the\nstructure is very similar to that of the solution (4.6), although the geometrical setting is\ndifferent. Fortunately, in this case, all regular Spin(7) metrics are known in the closed\nform [6],[7],[10] and so we can read the condition for Q\u0303 admitting global solutions. By\nmaking the power series expansion of the known solutions at t = 0 we find that the global\nsolutions can arise in the parameter region Q\u0303 \u2265 \u22121/3: the perturbative solutions lift to\nthe metrics of Spin(7) holonomy defined on the bundle of chiral spinors over S 4 . More\nprecisely the solutions in the regions (a) \u22121/3 < Q\u0303 < 0, (b) Q\u0303 = 0, (c) Q\u0303 > 0 lift to\n\u2212\nthe ALC metrics B+\n8 , B8 and B8 respectively, using the notation of [10]. The boundary\n\n18\n\n\fQ\u0303 = \u22121/3 corresponds to the metric of Spin(7) holonomy obtained in [6],[7], and the\nlimit Q\u0303 \u2192 \u221e reduces to the metric of G2 holonomy on the R3 bundle over S 4 [6],[7].\nThe ALC solutions in this paper corresponds to the solution B8 and we expect there are\n\u2212\ndeformations like B+\n8 , and B8 in our case too.\n\nReferences\n[1] B.
