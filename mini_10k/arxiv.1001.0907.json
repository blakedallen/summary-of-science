Introduction\nIn many studies of cell mechanics and dynamics, the cell is characterized as a viscoelastic\nbody [1\u20133]. It is an intriguing question to what extent such mechanical behaviour\ncan be rationalized in terms of comparatively simple polymer physics models. In this\nrespect, the comparison of cell rheological data and minimalistic in vitro reconstituted\nconstructs of the cytoskeleton, such as pure actin solutions [4\u20138] or crosslinked actin\nnetworks [9\u201314], has recently provided many new insights. Important progress has\nalso been achieved in the development of phenomenological mathematical descriptions.\nThis includes approaches related to the tube model [15\u201318], tensegrity-based approaches\n[19\u201321], effective-medium models [22\u201324], and some others [25, 26]. In particular, the\nglassy wormlike chain (Gwlc) model [27], a phenomenological extension of the standard\nWlc model of semiflexible polymers [28] has been successful in describing a plethora\nof rheological data for polymer solutions [7, 29] and living cells [30] over many decades\nin time with a minimum of parameters. However, all these studies were primarily\nconcerned with viscoelastic behaviour, while the latest investigations have underscored\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n2\n\nthe glassy [31\u201333] fragile [34, 35], and inelastic [34\u201336] character of the mechanical\nresponse of living cells. Even for biopolymer networks in vitro, experiments operating\nin the nonlinear regime had so far to resort to special protocols that minimize plastic\nflow [8, 37] in order to make contact with dedicated theoretical models.\nThe aim of the present contribution is to overcome this restriction by extending\nthe Gwlc to situations involving inelastic deformations. As a first step, we concentrate\nonto reversible inelastic behaviour, where the deformation does not alter the microscopic\nground state. The protocol applied by Trepat et al. [34] provides a paradigmatic\nexample. Cells are subjected to a transient stretch such that, after some additional\nwaiting time in the unstretched state, the (linear) material properties of the initial\nstate are recovered. The simplification for the theoretical modelling results from the\nassumption that not only the macro-state but also the micro-state of the system may\nto a good approximation be treated as reversible under such conditions; i.e., we assume\nthat the complete conformation of the polymer network, including the transiently\nbroken bonds between adjacent polymers, is constrained to eventually return to its\noriginal equilibrium state. For the time-delayed hysteretic response of the network to\nsuch protocols one could thus still speak of a viscoelastic (\"anelastic\") response in an\noperational sense, but we refrain from doing so in view of the fundamentally inelastic\nnature of the underlying stochastic process - in contrast to the reversible softening\neffects observed in [38], for example. Indeed, by simply allowing bonds to reform\nin new conformational states, the model developed below can readily be extended\nto arbitrary irreversible plastic deformations, as will be demonstrated elsewhere [45].\nBefore entering the discussion of our model, we would also like to point out that the\nproposed (inelastic) extension of the Gwlc is strongly constrained by identifying the\nnewly introduced parameters with those of the original (viscoelastic) Gwlc model,\nwhere possible. Despite its increased complexity, the extended model will therefore\nenable us to subject the underlying physical picture to a more stringent test than\nhitherto possible by comparing its predictions to dedicated experiments. Moreover,\nunlike current state-of-the-art simulation studies [25] it is not limited to rod networks\nbut is firmly routed in a faithful mathematical description of the underlying Brownian\npolymer dynamics.\nThis paper is organized as follows. First, we review some basic facts about the\nGwlc in section 2.1. Next, in section 2.2, we introduce our extended reversible inelastic\nversion, which we formulate using the notion of an effective interaction potential as in the\noriginal construction of the Gwlc in [27]. (A preliminary account of the basic procedure\nand some of its cell-biological motivation including reversible bond-breaking kinetics has\nrecently been given in a conference proceedings [39].) Sections 3.1 and 3.2 explain the\nphysical mechanism underlying the mechanical response under pulsed and periodically\npulsed loading, while section 3.3 illustrates its phenomenology. We demonstrate that\nthe model exhibits the hallmarks of nonlinear cell mechanics: strain/stress stiffening,\nfluidization, and cyclic softening [34\u201336]. Section 3.4 investigates the relevance of the\nlately quantified structural heterogeneities in networks of semiflexible polymers [40] for\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n3\n\nthe mechanical properties, before we conclude and close with a brief outlook.\n2. Theory\n2.1. The glassy wormlike chain\nThe glassy wormlike chain (Gwlc) is a phenomenological extension of the wormlike\nchain (Wlc) model, the well-established standard model of semiflexible polymers. A\nbroad overview over Wlc and Gwlc dynamics can be found elsewhere [28]. The\nWlc describes the mechanics of an isolated semiflexible polymer in an isothermal\nviscous solvent. In the weakly bending rod approximation, a solution of the stochastic\ndifferential equations of motion for the Wlc is possible via a mode decomposition ansatz\nfor the transverse displacement of the polymer contour from the straight ground state.\nThe individual modes labelled by an index n are independent of each other and decay\nexponentially with rates \u03c4n\u22121 . For convenience, we set the thermal energy kB T = 1,\nso that the bending rigidity can be identified with the persistence length `p , in the\nfollowing. Using this convention, the Wlc expression for the transverse susceptibility\nof a polymer of contour length L (with respect to a point force) reads [27]\n\u221e\n1\nL3 X\n.\n(1)\n\u03b1Wlc (\u03c9) =\n4\n4\n2\n`p \u03c0 n=1 (n + n f /fL )(1 + i\u03c9\u03c4n )\nHere, f is an optional backbone tension, and fL \u2261 \u03c0 2 `p /L2 the Euler buckling force for\na hinged rod of length L. The different powers of n in the denominator give notice of\nthe competition of bending and stretching forces.\n\nFigure 1. Cartoon of a test polymer (differently coloured) in a network. The trapping\nof the test polymer is schematically represented by means of an effective interaction\n(figure 2) indicated by the potential wells at sticky entanglement points, which are\non average separated by an contour length Le . The test polymer can bind/unbind by\novercoming an energy barrier of height E. The average contour length between the\nclosed bonds is \u039b.\n\nIn the Gwlc, interactions of the polymer with the surrounding network (e.g.\nexcluded volume interactions or sticky contacts) are reflected in an altered Wlc mode\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n4\n\nrelaxation spectrum [27, 29]. The intuitive - albeit not fully microscopic - picture\nunderlying the formulation of the Gwlc is illustrated in figure 1, which depicts a\ntest polymer reversibly bound to the background network via potential wells at all\ntopological contacts, the so-called entanglement points. Consider now a generic point\nsomewhere along the polymer backbone (not an entanglement point). It can relax\nfreely until the constrictions are being felt, which slow down the contributions from\nlong wavelength bending modes. The Gwlc translates this intuition into a simple\nprescription for the mode spectrum: the short-wavelength modes are directly taken over\nfrom the wormlike chain model, while modes of wavelength \u03bbn longer than the typical\ncontour length \u039b between adjacent bonds are modified to account for the slowdown.\nMotivated by the physical picture illustrated in figure 1, the slowdown of the relaxation\nof a wavelength \u03bbn is expressed by an Arrhenius factor exp [E (\u03bbn /\u039b \u2212 1)] for breaking\n(\u03bbn /\u039b \u2212 1) potential energy barriers of height E simultaneously. Accordingly, the\nphenomenological recipe to turn a Wlc into a Gwlc reads:\n(\n\u03c4n\n\u03bbn < \u039b\n\u03c4n \u2192 \u03c4\u0303n =\n.\n(2)\n\u03c4n exp [E(\u03bbn /\u039b \u2212 1)] \u03bbn \u2265 \u039b\nUpon inserting this into (1) one obtains the Gwlc susceptibility \u03b1Gwlc (\u03c9). The\nmicroscopic \"modulus\" for transverse point excitations of a generic backbone element\non a test polymer is then defined as the inverse susceptibility, gGwlc (\u03c9) = 1/\u03b1Gwlc (\u03c9).\nAn approximate expression for the macroscopic shear modulus is obtained along similar\nlines [22, 27].\nIn the original equilibrium Gwlc theory, \u039b was assumed to be a constant on the\norder of the entanglement length of the network, \u039b & Le . Note, however, that Le\nis a geometric quantity (which is determined by the polymer concentration and the\npersistence length) while the contour length \u039b between closed bonds clearly depends on\nthe state of the bond network. One therefore has to allow for an increase of \u039b with the\nnumber of broken bonds in non-equilibrium applications. This issue is explored in the\nfollowing.\n2.2. Effective interaction potential and bond kinetics\nAll mechanical quantities calculated within the Gwlc model crucially depend on the\ninteraction length \u039b. In previous applications of the model [7, 27, 30] it was assumed that\n\u039b remains constant - equal to its equilibrium value and unaffected by the deformation\nof the sample. In other words, the equilibrium theory allowed for statistical bond\nfluctuations but not for a dynamical evolution of the parameters characterizing the\nthermodynamic state of the bond network. An obvious starting point for generalizations\nof the model to non-equilibrium situations is therefore to consider the number of closed\nbonds, and therefore also \u039b, as dynamic variables, dependent on the strain- and stresshistory of the network. We now provide a mean-field description to account for such\na dynamically evolving bond network. For clarity, we return to the intuitive picture\nunderlying the Gwlc where the (possibly crosslinker- or molecular-motor-mediated)\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n5\n\ncomplex interactions between the polymers are summarized into an effective interaction\npotential for a test segment against the background, as sketched in figure 2. The\nsame idea has also been used before in many related situations (e.g. [26, 41, 42]).\nThe generic potential exhibits three essential features: a well-defined bound state, a\n\n\"bound\"\n\nk-\n\n(\u03b5-U)\n\nV\n\nk+\n\n\"unbound\"\n\n\u03b5\n\nU\nxb\n\nxt\n\nx\n\nxu\n\nFigure 2. Sketch of the schematic effective interaction potential for a test segment\nagainst the background. A polymer segment can either be \"bound\" by a transient\ncrosslinker or a sticky patch on the backbone of another polymer (left potential well)\nor \"unbound\" and merely confined by the surrounding network to a tube like cage\n(right well). When considering an ensemble of contacts, the fraction of closed bonds\ndepends on the free energy difference U between both states. The transition rates k\u2212\nand k+ between the bound and unbound state depend on the barrier heights E and\n(E \u2212 U ), respectively. An externally applied force can tilt the potential and favour\nbinding or unbinding events.\n\nwell-defined unbound state, and a barrier in between (figure 2). The confining well\ncorresponding to the unbound state represents the tube-like caging of the test polymer\nwithin the surrounding network [15, 17, 43]. For ease of notation, we further introduce\nthe dimensionless fraction of closed bonds or, bond fraction\n\u03bd(t) \u2261 \u039b0 /\u039b(t) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhich is simply the ensemble-averaged fraction of sticky contacts that are actually in the\nbound state. The minimum bond distance \u039b0 is typically on the order of Le , but may be\nsomewhat larger in situations where the bonds are mediated by crosslinker molecules or\nby partially sterically inaccessible sticky patches (as e.g. for helical molecules [12, 44]).\nA quantitatively fully consistent way of calculating the dynamics of \u03bd would\ninvolve solving the full Fokker-Planck equation for a Wlc-Wlc contact - a formidable\nprogram to be pursued elsewhere [45]. Here, for the sake of our qualitative purposes,\nwe chose to concentrate onto the physical essence of the discussion, and keep the\nmathematical structure as simple and transparent as possible. We therefore approximate\nthe dynamics by a simple exponential relaxation as familiar from the standard example\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n6\n\nof reacting Brownian particles, conventionally described by Kramers theory with a Belllike force dependence [46, 47]. Using this simplification and assuming a schematic\ninteraction potential as depicted in figure 2, the value of \u03bd is determined by a competition\nof bond breaking and bond formation with reaction rates k\u2212 and k+ , respectively.\nBoth rates are represented in the usual adiabatic approximation (meaning that the\nequilibration inside the wells is much faster than the barrier crossing and external\nperturbations) by [46]\nk\u2212 \u03c40 = e\u2212E+(xt \u2212xb )f ,\n\nk+ \u03c40 = e\u2212E+U \u2212(xu \u2212xt )f ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c40 is an intrinsic characteristic Brownian time scale for bond breaking and\nformation\u2021, and f is the force pulling on the bond. Noting that the fraction of open\nbonds is 1 \u2212 \u03bd, we can then write down the following rate equation for the fraction of\nclosed bonds\n\u03bd\u0307(t)\u03c40 eE = \u2212(e\u2212(xu \u2212xt )f (t)+U + e(xt \u2212xb )f (t) )\u03bd(t) + e\u2212(xu \u2212xt )f (t)+U .\n\n(5)\n\nThe time dependence of \u03bd(t) leads via (3) to an implicit time dependence of the\nGwlc-parameter \u039b(t) and thereby of all observables derived from the Gwlc. The\ntime-dependent force f (t) in (5) may be thought to result from an externally imposed\nstress protocol or from internal dynamical elements such as molecular motors setting\nthe network under dynamic stress. Hence, via an appropriately chosen set of slowly\nchanging state parameters f (t), U (t), E(t), . . . the model can in principle accommodate\nfor the active biological remodelling in living cells and tissues [39]. (For a discussion of\nthe relation between the microscopic f and the macroscopic stress, see [29].) Note that\nfor constant force, the stationary value of \u03bd,\n\u03bdstat = (1 + exp [\u2212U + (xu + xb )fstat ])\u22121 ,\n\n(6)\n\nobtained by setting \u03bd\u0307 \u2261 0, does not depend on E, as it should be (the steady state is\nindependent of the transition state).\n3. Results and discussions\n3.1. Viscoelastic properties\nWhenever the bond kinetics can be disregarded (\u03bd\u0307 = 0), the viscoelastic properties are\nsimply those of the bare Gwlc [7, 27, 29, 30], which can basically be characterized as\nWlc short time dynamics followed by a slow, highly stretched logarithmic relaxation\nresembling power-law rheology with a non-universal exponent within the typical\nexperimental time windows. Strong perturbations (stress or strain) then give rise to\na pronounced stiffening due to the steeply nonlinear response of semiflexible polymers\nunder elongation [2]. This well established behaviour can be understood as the canvas\n\u2021 Strictly speaking the fluctuations in the potential wells at xb and xu are characterized by different\nBrownian time scales depending on the width of the potential wells.

It is\nused to determine the linear as well as (via a nonlinear update scheme, see Appendix\nA) the nonlinear force response of the system. To understand how the time-dependence\n(5) of \u03bd affects this important quantity, it is instructive to first examine the dependence\nof g on \u03bd. To this end, we formally consider \u03bd temporarily as an independent variable\ninstead of determining it from (5). Note that this approach nevertheless makes sense as\nfor a fixed set of parameters, \u03bd can still take any value between zero and one. This is\ndue to the freedom of choosing an initial state, which can be imagined to have evolved\nfrom the prior deformation history.\nFor fixed other parameters, both the real part g 0 (figure 3a) and the imaginary part\ng 00 of g increase monotonically with \u03bd. We emphasize that g 00 is not simply proportional\nto g 0 and therefore the loss angle \u03b4 = arctan(g 00 /g 0 ) also depends on \u03bd (figure 3b). For\nsmall \u03bd, the loss angle is large, corresponding to fluid-like behaviour. With increasing\n\u03bd, the system becomes more solid-like. Increasing the barrier height E makes the\ndependence of g on \u03bd more pronounced (figure 3). Conversely, as can be expected,\nthe dependence on the barrier height E vanishes with decreasing bond fraction \u03bd. Note\nthat due to the boundary conditions the limit of a Newtonian fluid (\u03b4 = \u03c0/2) is not\nrecovered when formally taking the limit of vanishing bond fraction (\u03bd \u2192 0, \u039b \u2192 \u221e).\nFinally, the potential difference U solely determines the dynamics of \u03bd via (5), and\ntherefore influences the modulus g solely through the equilibrium value for \u03bd.\nAfter these general considerations, we now concentrate on the nonlinear and nonequilibrium dynamic response of the extended inelastic Gwlc model, which results\nfrom the coupled relaxation of the viscoelastic polymer network and the transient bond\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n8\n\nnetwork.\n3.2. Stress-stiffening versus rate-dependent yielding\nA convenient way to characterize the mechanical properties of an inelastic material is a\nforce-displacement curve. For a perfectly linear elastic (Hookean) body, it would simply\nconsist of a straight line, whereas a perfectly plastic body would feature as a rectangle\ndelineated by a yield force fy and an arbitrary plastic strain value. For our qualitative\npurpose, we identify the average transverse displacement of the test polymer segment\n(which is used to determine the force response, see Appendix A) with the reaction\ncoordinate x of the schematic potential sketched in figure 2; and we identify the force\nf entering the reaction rates with the backbone tension of the test polymer. As a\ncharacteristic length scale for the transverse displacements we use the width (xu \u2212 xt )\nof the effective confinement potential, which is a measure of a typical mean-square\ndisplacement of the polymer in the unbound state. Using this convention, we now\nconsider the effect of a time-symmetric displacement pulse on the evolution of the force\nf (t) and bond fraction \u03bd(t). For technical convenience, we use a Gaussian shape for the\ndisplacement pulses, but the qualitative conclusions to be drawn are largely independent\nof the precise protocol. The duration of the displacement pulse, which sets the time\nscale for the dynamic response, is used as the unit of time in the following. Here, we\nare not interested in short-time tension-propagation and single-polymer dynamics [48],\nhence a lower bound for pertinent pulse durations is provided by the interaction time\nscale \u03c4\u039b0 ' \u03c40 . On the other hand, for pulse durations longer than \u03c40 eE the system\ndeformation would be quasistatic so that no genuinely dynamic effects of the bond\nkinetics could be observed.\nFor a small Gaussian displacement pulse of relative amplitude 0.73 (c.f. figure 4a\nand Appendix A), the shape of the curve predicted by our inelastic Gwlc model shows\nall features of a viscoelastic medium (figure 4b, blue dashed curve). It starts with\na nearly linear regime for relative displacements . 0.4, where a weak stiffening sets\nin. Due to dissipation in the medium, the path back to the initial state takes its\ncourse at lower force, which causes a weak hysteresis. This is essentially the viscoelastic\nresponse that already the bare Gwlc model would have predicted. For a larger relative\ndeformation amplitude of 2.2, however, the predictions of the bare Gwlc and the\ninelastic Gwlc diverge. The bare Gwlc predicts a strong stiffening (figure 4b, red\ndotted curve), whereas the full model exhibits an initial stiffening regime followed by a\npronounced softening (figure 4b, solid red curve). A very interesting observation is that\n\"softening\" in this case does not only mean a decrease of the slope of the force-extension\ncurve, but that the slope actually becomes negative over an extended parameter region,\nonce an operationally defined threshold force fy is exceeded. This \"flow state\" bears\nmore resemblance to plastic flow than to viscoelastic relaxation. The reason for this\nqualitatively new phenomenon is the force-induced bond breaking. Theoretically this\nis best exemplified by the time-dependence of the (experimentally not easily accessible)\n\n\fb\n\n2.5\n\n100\n\n2.0\n\n80\n\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n\n60\n40\n20\n\n0.0\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\n\n0\n0.0\n\nt\n\n0.5\n\nd\n200\n\nHxu-xtL fy\n\n0.60\n0.55\n0.50\n0.45\n0.40\n\n150\n100\n\nt\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n0.40\n0.35\n0.30\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.001\n\n0.1\n\n10\n\n1000\n\nHxu-xt L f\n\n50\n0\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\n\n1.0\n\nx\u0090Hxu-xtL\n\u039dmin\n\nc\n\n\u039d\n\n9\n\na\nHxu-xtL f\n\nx\u0090Hxu-xtL\n\nInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n0.01 0.1 1\n\n10 100 1000 104\n\nHxu-xtL f\n\nFigure 4. Transition from a stiffening to a softening response at a rate-dependent,\noperationally defined yield force fy : Gaussian deformation pulses (a) with relative\ndisplacement amplitudes of 0.73 (dashed) and 2.2 (solid); corresponding forcedisplacement curves and bond fraction evolutions (b, c; dotted curve in b: response of a\nGwlc without bond breaking); order-of-magnitude estimate for the rate-dependence\nof the yield force, (7) with const.= 2.2, versus the numerically obtained maximum\nforces of the force-displacement curves for various mean force rates (d); the minimum\nbond fraction (d, inset) depends non-monotonically on the force rate; E = 10.5, U = 2,\n\u03c40 = 0.004, (xt \u2212 xb )/(xu \u2212 xt ) = 0.07, \u039b0 = 22.3.\n\nfraction \u03bd(t) of closed bonds (figure 4c). A glance at the bond fraction during the weak\ndeformation scenario (figure 4c, blue dashed curve) reveals how the limit of a bare Gwlc\nis recovered, namely whenever the deformation is not sufficiently violent and persistent\nto significantly decrease the fraction of closed bonds. For the large deformation scenario,\nin contrast, the bond fraction stays only initially constant (figure 4c, solid red curve). As\na consequence of the large strain the force rises steeply, as can be seen from the strong\nstiffening in figure 4b (solid red curve). At the yield force, the bond fraction suddenly\ndecreases to nearly half of its initial value during a very short time. The decrease in the\nbond fraction is accompanied by a somewhat slower drop in the force, which is reflected\nin the sudden softening of the force-displacement curve. The bond fraction eventually\nrecovers on a much slower time scale, which is roughly given by \u03c40 exp(E \u2212U ). Note that\neven though the effects of the inelastic response dominate the stress-strain curve, the\nviscoelastic relaxations from the underlying Gwlc model are still present. They could\nhardly be disentangled from the inelastic contributions, though, without an underlying\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n10\n\nfaithful model of the viscoelastic response at hand.\nIn summary, we observe a competition between force-amplitude dependent stressstiffening and force-rate dependent yielding events. If the backbone force stays much\nsmaller than the yield force, the adaptation of the bond network requires an adiabatically\nlong time, on the order of the bond lifetime \u03c40 eE , so that plain viscoelastic Gwlc\nbehaviour is observed on the pulse time scale. In contrast, if the backbone tension\nf reaches the yield force fy , the bond fraction declines sharply, thereby switching the\nresponse from the Wlc/Gwlc-typical stiffening to a pronounced softening.\nThe rate dependence of the yield force fy can be estimated by setting the time it\ntakes to reach the yield force, fy /f \u0307, equal to the force-dependent time scale of bond\n\u22121\nopening, k\u2212\n(f ), from (4),\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u22121\nfy f \u0307\u22121 ' k\u2212\n(fy ) \u21d2 (xt \u2212 xb )fy \u2248 LW const. \u00d7 (xt \u2212 xb )\u03c40 eE f \u0307 . (7)\nHere, LW(x) is the positive real branch of the Lambert W function. In figure 4d, this\nestimate is compared with results from numerical evaluations for Gaussian displacement\npulses at different average rates. Apart from the numerical errors, the slight deviations\nfrom the estimate may be attributed to the fact that the force rate is not constant for\nthe Gaussian protocol. They can be mostly eliminated by using force ramp protocols of\nvarious slopes instead of the Gaussian displacement pulses. For not too low rates, the\nrate dependence can be approximated by the even simpler relation\n(xt \u2212 xb )fy \u2248 (E + ln f \u0307\u03c40 + const.) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the force rate has to be normalized by a suitable force scale.\nThe minimum bond fraction reached during the application of the pulse, which\nwe interpret as a measure of the degree of fluidization, depends non-monotonically on\nthe rate (figure 4d, inset). Qualitatively, this can be understood by noticing that two\ndifferent factors influence the fluidization, namely the maximum force attained during\ndeformation and the time over which the force is applied. The maximum force is simply\nthe yield force fy , with the rate dependence in (7) and figure 4d, while the reciprocal\nrate itself sets the time scale. For high rates (xu \u2212 xt )f \u0307 & 1 (in our example) the\nrate-dependence of the maximum force wins and the minimum \u03bd reached decreases with\nincreasing rate. For low rates, where the rate-dependence of the maximum force is\nmuch weaker (figure 4d) the minimum \u03bd decreases with increasing pulse duration, viz.\ndecreasing rate. Note that for slow pulses (low rates), the bond fraction after the pulse\nmay be quite different from the minimum \u03bd, as significant recovery may already take\nplace during the pulse.\n3.3. Transient remodelling and cyclic softening\nThe substantial changes in the material properties accompanying bond breaking can\nbe exemplified by monitoring the linear elastic modulus g 0 (\u03c90 ) (measured at a fixed\nfrequency \u03c90 ) in response to a strain pulse (figure 5a). Apart from the usual\nWlc/Gwlc-typical stress-stiffening below the threshold force fy , the modulus is seen\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n11\n\nto drop below the value it had before the deformation pulse, where it apparently\nsaturates (remember that the deformation vanishes for t > 1 and that the recovery\ntakes roughly a time \u03c40 eE\u2212U \u001d 1). We thus observe what we call a \"passive\", \"physical\"\nremodelling of the bond network as opposed to the \"active\", \"biological\" remodelling of\nthe cytoskeleton of living cells in response to external stimuli. These passive remodelling\neffects have recently been observed for human airway smooth muscle cells [34]. (A more\nquantitative discussion of the relation to the experimental observations will be given\nelsewhere.) The fact that the deformation pulse leads to a decrease in g 0 and an increase\nin the loss angle \u03b4 (figure 5c) suggests the notion of fluidization [34].\n\nb\n\n15\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n10\n\n0.7\n\ng'n\n\ng'n\n\na\n\n0.6\n\n5\n0.5\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n50\n\n100 200\n\n50\n\n100 200\n\nt\n\nd\n0.45\n0.40\n\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\n0.8\n\nt\n\nc\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.35\n0.30\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nt\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\nt\n\nFigure 5.

This indicates that also the change in the system properties is a\ntransient effect, which is demonstrated by the recovery from fluidization in figure 5 b\n& d. Thus, while the fluidization resembles a plastic process on short time scales, on\nlong times scales, the phenomenology is more similar to pseudo- and superelasticity as\nobserved in shape-memory alloys [49].\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n12\n\nTo demonstrate that the transient passive remodelling also affects the nonlinear\nmaterial properties, we consider a series of three pulses, next (figure 6). The force\nresponse to such a protocol is depicted in figure 6b. The force-displacement curve\nfor the second stretching (second left branch of the solid curve) is less steep than for\nthe first stretching (very left branch of the solid curve) and the yield force is lower.\nThis indicates a cyclic softening, or viscoelastic shake-down effect, closely related to\nthe fluidization of the network by strain. The strength of the shake-down depends\non the fraction of transiently broken bonds, and hence on the rate as well as on the\namplitude of the applied deformation (c.f. figure 6c, solid red curve). Upon repeated\napplication of deformation pulses the force-displacement curves settle on a limit-curve\nthat is essentially preconditioned by the initial deformation pulse and the inelastic work\nit performed on the sample. For more gentle protocols that only break a smaller fraction\nof bonds, the initial fluidization would be not as pronounced and one would obtain a\ngradual shake-down, which converges to a limit curve only after many cycles.\n\na\nx\u0090Hxu-xtL\n\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nt\n\nb\n100\n\n60\n\n\u039d\n\nHxu-xtL f\n\n80\n\n40\n20\n0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nx\u0090Hxu-xtL\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n4\n\nc\n0.60\n0.55\n0.50\n0.45\n0.40\n0.35\n0.30\n0.25\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nt\n\nFigure 6.

Introducing multiple length scales\nSo far, we have assumed that there is one well-defined characteristic length scale \u039b0\nfor the polymer interactions, which is on the order of the entanglement length Le and\ninterpreted as the minimum average contour distance between adjacent bonds of the test\npolymer with the background network. This is clearly a mean-field assumption. Recent\ncombined experimental and theoretical studies have established that the local tube\ndiameter and entanglement length in pure semiflexible polymer solutions actually exhibit\na skewed leptocurtic distribution with broad tails [40]. To include this information\nin the above analysis is not straightforward, since the elastic interactions between\nregions of different entanglement length are not known, a priori. For the sake of a first\nqualitative estimate, the simplest procedure seems to be to average the above results over\na distribution of \u039b0 , corresponding to a parallel connection of independent entanglement\nelements. Qualitatively, this renders the abrupt transition from stiffening to softening\nsomewhat smoother (c.f. figure 6b, dashed curve). Moreover, the initial stiffening is\nslightly more pronounced. This is due to the contributions of \u039b0 < \u039b0 , which exhibit\nboth stronger stiffening and fluidization. Nevertheless, all qualitative features - like\nstiffening and remodelling effects and a \"flow state\" indicating fluidization or inelastic\nshakedown - can still be well discerned. This is consistent with the assumption that\npure semiflexible polymer solutions are at least qualitatively well described by a single\nentanglement length [17, 18, 22, 27, 50].\n4. Conclusions and outlook\nWe have presented a theoretical framework for a polymer-based description of the\ninelastic nonlinear mechanical behaviour of sticky biopolymer networks. We represented\nthe polymer network on a mean-field level by a test polymer described by the\nphenomenologically highly successful Gwlc model. Beyond the equilibrium statistical\nfluctuations captured by the original model, we additionally allowed for a dynamically\nevolving thermodynamic state variable \u039b(t) characterizing the network of thermoreversible sticky bonds, which is updated dynamically upon bond breaking according\nto an appropriate rate equation. Within our approximate treatment we could obtain\na number of robust and qualitatively interesting results, which are not sensitive to the\nprecise parameter values chosen, nor to the choice of the transverse rather than the\nlongitudinal susceptibility in (1). For sufficiently strong deformations, changes in the\nmean fraction of closed bonds, reflected in \u039b(t), can influence material properties to a\ndegree at which the material behaves qualitatively different from the usual viscoelastic\nparadigm. In particular, our theory predicts a pronounced fluidization response, which\ndevelops upon strong deformations on top of the intrinsic viscoelastic stiffening response\nprovided by the individual polymers. After cessation of loading, the system slowly\nrecovers its initial state. These observations are in qualitative agreement with recently\npublished experimental results obtained for living cells [34], and a more quantitative\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n14\n\ncomparison with dedicated measurement results for cells and in vitro biopolymer\nnetworks will be the subject of future work. We found the yield force for the onset\nof the fluidization to be sensitive to the deformation rate. Moreover, the fluidization\nresponse was shown to be accompanied by a cyclic softening or shake-down effect.\nTaking into account the spatial heterogeneity of biopolymer solutions by a distribution\nof entanglement lengths leads to a smoothing of the force-displacement curves without\naffecting their qualitative characteristics. One may still expect qualitatively new effects\nin situations with unusually broad distributions of entanglement lengths, such as for\nstrongly heterogeneous (e.g. phase separating) networks.\nA parameter that was found to be very important for cells [51] but has not\nbeen discussed much in this contribution is the prestressing force f0 (see appendix\nAppendix A), which is present in adhering cells even in the absence of external driving.\nExperimentally, it was established that increasing prestress is correlated with a higher\nstiffness of adhering cells [51] which in turn is correlated with a higher stiffness of\nthe substrate [52]. When naively treating the prestressing force just as an additive\ncontribution to the overall force, our model predicts the opposite: the additional force\nbreaks more bonds and the network becomes softer and more fluid-like. To reconcile\nthese apparently contradicting trends, one can appeal to the notion of homeostasis,\nwhich essentially amounts to postulating that the cell actively adapts its structure such\nthat a certain set of thermodynamic state variables remain in a physiologically sensible\nrange [39]. This basically implies that the cell will respond to stiff substrates or persistent\nexternal stresses by a biological remodelling that corresponds to an increase of E and\nU , and possibly to a decrease of \u039b0 . By adapting also the internal prestress f0 , the\ncell may then avoid, apart from the structural collapse, an equally undesirable loss of\nflexibility. We note, however, that internal stresses are indeed observed to disrupt the\ncytoskeleton, as implied by the simple physical theory presented here, if they are not\npermanently balanced by a substrate [53].\nEven though the nonlinear effects presented in this contribution depend crucially on\nthe bond kinetics, it should not be overlooked that the Gwlc is an equally indispensable\ningredient of the complete theory. First, it provides the constitutive relation that gives\nthe force in response to an infinitesimal displacement, which in turn governs the bond\nkinetics. Secondly, the time-dependent linear susceptibility strongly filters the dynamic\nremodelling of the bond network in practical applications, in which one rarely has access\nto the microstate of the underlying bond network. In summary, the extended model\nthus integrates experimentally confirmed features of the Gwlc response such as slow\nrelaxation, power-law rheology, viscoelastic hysteresis, and shear stiffening with a simple\nbond kinetics scheme, which allows less intuitive complex nonlinear physical remodelling\neffects like fluidization and inelastic shake-down to be addressed.\nFinally, we want to point out that it is straightforward to extend the above analysis\nin a natural way to account for irreversible plastic deformations [45]. To this end, one\nhas to allow for the possibility that the transiently broken bonds reform somewhere else\nthan at their original sites (as always assumed in the foregoing discussion) after strong\n\n\fInelastic mechanics of sticky biopolymer networks\n\n15\n\ndeformations with finite residual displacement. This can be included by accommodating\nan additional term acting as a \"slip rate\" in (5) [45].\nAcknowledgments\nWe acknowledge many fruitful discussions with J. Glaser, S. Sturm, and K.

Obtaining force-displacement curves and solving for \u03bd\nThe deformation pulse protocol used in this paper is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(t \u2212 \u03c4 )2\n.\n\u0393(t) = \u03b30 exp \u2212\n\u03c32\n\n(A.1)\n\nTo obtain the full nonlinear response of the (extended) Gwlc to the displacement\nprotocol (A.1), we make use of the superposition principle: We know that the Fourier\ntransform of gGwlc (\u03c9, \u039b, f )/(i\u03c9) is the linear response to a small displacement step.\nAfter decomposing a finite displacement into infinitesimal displacement steps and a\npartial integration, we write\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\nd\u03c9\n0\n\u221a gGwlc (\u03c9, \u039b(t), fGwlc (t)) e\u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212t ) \u0393(t0 ).

Using (A.1) and integrating by parts, we obtain\nZ \u221e\n\u221a\n\u03c32 \u03c92\nfGwlc (t) = 2\u03b30 \u03c3 d\u03c9 e\u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212\u03c4 ) gGwlc (\u03c9, \u039b(t), fGwlc (t))e\u2212 4 .\n(A.3)\n0\n\nThe next step is to identify a connection between the force in (5) and fGwlc (t). A\nfinite prestressing force f0 is introduced mainly for technical reasons, namely to avoid\nthe unphysical region of negative (i.e. compressive) backbone stress, which would buckle\nthe polymers. While the physics of the prestressed network can essentially be mapped\nback to that of a network without prestress by a renormalization of the parameters E\nand U , prestress may also be seen as an important feature: indeed, the cytoskeleton of\nadhered cells is well known to be under permanent prestress, and suspended cells seem\nprone to spontaneous shape oscillations that could be indicative of a propensity of the\ncells to set themselves under prestress [39]. In the context and on the longer time scales\nof the biological remodelling of the cytoskeleton it would therefore make sense to think\nof f0 as a dynamic force generated by molecular motors and polymerization forces. For\nthe following, however, we take the prestress to be constant so that the force entering\n(5) is\nf (t) = f0 + fGwlc (t).\n\n(A.4)\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\n16\n\nWe now face the problem that (A.2) is an implicit equation for fGwlc (t), which depends\non \u03bd(t), which in turn depends via f (t) on fGwlc (t). We therefore use a two-step Euler\nscheme: As initial values for f and \u03bd, we choose the prestressing force, f (t = 0) = f0 ,\nand the steady-state value under the prestressing force, \u03bd(t = 0) = \u03bd(t \u2192 \u221e|f = f0 ),\nrespectively. We then choose a sufficiently small time step \u2206t and apply the following\niterative rule:\nf (k\u2206t) \u2248 f0 + fGW LC (k\u2206t|f ((k \u2212 1)\u2206t, \u03bd((k \u2212 1)\u2206t))\n\n(A.5)\n\n\u03bd\u0307(k\u2206t) \u2248 \u03bd\u0307(k\u2206t|f (k\u2206t)),\n\n(A.6)\n\nwhere k \u2208 N+ . In the limit \u2206t \u2192 0, this procedure converges to the exact solution.\nReferences\n[1] Y Fung 1993 Biomechanics: Mechanical Properties of Living Tissues Springer.\n[2] FC MacKintosh, J K\u00e4s and P Janmey 1995 Elasticity of semiflexible biopolymer\nnetworks Phys.
