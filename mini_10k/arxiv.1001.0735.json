Hybrid logic extends modal logic with support for reasoning about individual states,\ndesignated by so-called nominals. We study hybrid logic in the broad context of coalgebraic semantics, where Kripke frames are replaced with coalgebras for a given functor, thus covering a wide range\nof reasoning principles including, e.g., probabilistic, graded, default, or coalitional operators. Specifically, we establish generic criteria for a given coalgebraic hybrid logic to admit named canonical\nmodels, with ensuing completeness proofs for pure extensions on the one hand, and for an extended\nhybrid language with local binding on the other. We instantiate our framework with a number of\nexamples. Notably, we prove completeness of graded hybrid logic with local binding.\n\nIntroduction\nModal logics have traditionally played a central role in Computer Science, appearing, e.g., in the\nguise of temporal logics, program logics such as PDL, epistemic logics, and later as description\nlogics. The development of modal logics has seen extensions along (at least) two axes: the enhancement of the expressive power of basic (relational) modal logic on the one hand, and the continual\nextension, beyond the purely relational realm, of the class of structures described using modal logics\non the other hand. Hybrid logic falls into the first category, extending modal logic with the ability\nto reason about individual states in models. This feature, originally suggested by Prior and first\nstudied in the context of tense logics and PDL (see [5] for references), is of particular relevance in\nknowledge representation languages and as such has found its way into modern description logics,\nwhere it is denoted by the letter O in the standard naming scheme [2].\nExtensions along the second axis \u2013 semantics beyond Kripke structures and neighbourhood\nmodels \u2013 include various probabilistic modal logics, interpreted over probabilistic transition systems, graded modal logic over multigraphs [8], conditional logics over selection function frames [6],\nand coalition logic [17], interpreted over so-called game frames. As a unifying semantic bracket\ncovering all these logics and many further ones, coalgebraic modal logic has emerged ([7] gives a\nsurvey). The scope of coalgebraic modal logic has recently been expanded to encompass nominals;\nwe refer to the arising class of logics as coalgebraic hybrid logics. Existing results include a finite\n1998 ACM Subject Classification: F.4.1 [Mathematical Logic and Formal Languages]: Mathematical Logic - modal\nlogic; I.2.4 [Artificial Intelligence]: Knowledge Representation Formalisms and Methods - modal logic, representation\nlanguages.\nKey words and phrases: Logic in computer science, semantics, deduction, modal logic, coalgebra.\n\nc\nCC\n\nL.

PATTINSON\n\nmodel result, an internalized tableaux calculus, and generic PSPACE upper bounds, but are so\nfar limited to logics that exclude frame conditions and local binding [14]. What is missing from\nthis picture technically is a theory of named canonical models [5]. Named canonical models yield\nnot only strong completeness of the basic hybrid logic, but also completeness of pure extensions,\ndefined by axioms that do not contain propositional variables (but may contain nominals; e.g. in\nKripke semantics, the pure axiom \u2666\u2666i \u2192 \u2666i, with i a nominal, defines transitive frames). Moreover, named canonical models establish completeness for an extended hybrid language with a local\nbinding operator \u2193 x. \u03c6(x), read as \"the current state x satisfies \u03c6(x)\". Both pure extensions and the\nlanguage with \u2193 (not addressed in [14]) are, in general, undecidable [1] (it should be noted, however,\nthat fragments of the language with \u2193 over Kripke frames are decidable and as such play a role, e.g.,\nin conjunctive query answering in description logic [11]). As a consequence, completeness of pure\nextensions and local binding is the best we can hope for \u2013 it establishes recursive enumerability of\nthe set of valid formulas, and it enables automated reasoning, if not decision procedures.\nSpecifically, we establish two separate criteria for the existence of named models. Although\nthese criteria are (in all likelihood necessarily) less widely applicable than some previous coalgebraic results including those of [14], the generic results allow us to establish new completeness\nresults for a wide variety of logics; in particular, we prove strong completeness of graded hybrid\nlogic, and ultimately an extension of the description logic SHOQ, with the \u2193 binder over a wide\nvariety of frame classes.\n\n1. Coalgebraic Hybrid Logic\nTo make our treatment parametric in the syntax, we fix a modal similarity type \u039b consisting of\nmodal operators with associated arities throughout. For given countably infinite and disjoint sets\nP of propositional variables and N of nominals, the set (\u039b) of hybrid \u039b-formulas is given by the\ngrammar\n(\u039b) \u220b \u03c6, \u03c8 ::= p | i | \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 | \u00ac\u03c6 | \u2665(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) | @i \u03c6\nwhere p \u2208 P, i \u2208 N and \u2665 \u2208 \u039b is an n-ary modal operator. (Alternatively, we could regard propositional variables as nullary modal operators, thus avoiding their explicit mention altogether. We keep\nthem explicit here, following standard practice in modal logic, as we have to deal with valuations\nanyway due to the presence of nominals.) We use the standard definitions for the other propositional\nconnectives \u2192, \u2194, \u2228. The set of nominals occurring in a formula \u03c6 is denoted by N(\u03c6), similarly\nfor sets of formulas. A formula of the form @i \u03c6 is called an @-formula. Semantically, nominals i\ndenote individual states in a model, and @i \u03c6 stipulates that \u03c6 holds at state i.\nTo reflect parametricity also semantically, we equip hybrid logics with a coalgebraic semantics\nextending the standard coalgebraic semantics of modal logics [16]: we fix throughout a \u039b-structure\nconsisting of an endofunctor T : Set \u2192 Set on the category of sets, together with an assignment\nof an n-ary predicate lifting J\u2665K to every n-ary modal operator \u2665 \u2208 \u039b, i.e. a set-indexed family of\nmappings (J\u2665KX : P(X)n \u2192 P(T X))X\u2208Set that satisfies\nJ\u2665KX \u25e6 (f \u22121 )n = (T f )\u22121 \u25e6 J\u2665KY\nfor all f : X \u2192 Y . In categorical terms, [[\u2665]] is a natural transformation Qn \u2192 Q \u25e6 T op where\nQ : Setop \u2192 Set is the contravariant powerset functor.\nIn this setting, T -coalgebras play the roles of frames. A T -coalgebra is a pair (C, \u03b3) where\nC is a set of states and \u03b3 : C \u2192 T C is the transition function. When \u03b3 is clear from the context,\nwe refer to (C, \u03b3) just as C. A (hybrid) T -model M = (C, \u03b3, V ) consists of a T -coalgebra (C, \u03b3)\ntogether with a hybrid valuation V , i.e. a map P \u222a N \u2192 P(C) that assigns singleton sets to all\n\n\fNAMED MODELS IN COALGEBRAIC HYBRID LOGIC\n\n647\n\nnominals i \u2208 N. We say that M is based on the frame (C, \u03b3). The singleton set V (i) is tacitly\nidentified with its unique element.\nThe semantics of F(\u039b) is a satisfaction relation |= between states c \u2208 C in hybrid T -models\nM = (C, \u03b3, V ) and formulas \u03c6 \u2208 (\u039b), inductively defined as follows. For x \u2208 N \u222a P and i \u2208 N,\nM, c |= x iff c \u2208 V (x)\n\nand\n\nM, c |= @i \u03c6 iff M, V (i) |= \u03c6.\n\nModal operators are interpreted using their associated predicate liftings, that is,\nM, c |= \u2665(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b3(c) \u2208 J\u2665KC (J\u03c61 KM , . . . , J\u03c6n KM )\nwhere \u2665 \u2208 \u039b is n-ary and J\u03c6KM = {c \u2208 C | M, c |= \u03c6} denotes the truth-set of \u03c6 relative to M .\nWe write M |= \u03c6 if M, c |= \u03c6 for all c \u2208 C. For a set \u03a6 \u2286 (\u039b) of formulas, we write M, c |= \u03a6 if\nM, c |= \u03c6 for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6, and M |= \u03a6 if M |= \u03c6 for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6. We say that \u03a6 is satisfiable in a model\nM if there exists a state c in M such that M, c |= \u03a6. If A \u2286 (\u039b) is a set of axioms, also referred to\nas frame conditions, a frame (C, \u03b3) is an A-frame if (C, \u03b3, V ) |= \u03c6 for all hybrid valuations V and\nall \u03c6 \u2208 A, and a model is an A-model if it is based on an A-frame. A frame condition is pure if it\ndoes not contain any propositional variables (it may however contain nominals). We recall notation\nfrom earlier work:\nNotation 1. As usual, application of substitutions \u03c3 : P \u2192 (\u039b) to formulas \u03c6 is denoted \u03c6\u03c3.\nFor a set \u03a3 of formulas and a set O of operators, we write O\u03a3 or O(\u03a3) for the set of formulas\narising by prefixing elements of \u03a3 with an operator from O; e.g. \u039b(\u03a3) = {\u2665(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) | \u2665 \u2208\n\u039b n-ary, \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n \u2208 \u03a3} and @\u03a3 := {@i | i \u2208 N}(\u03a3) = {@i \u03c6 | i \u2208 N, \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a3}. Moreover,\nProp(Z) denotes the set of propositional combinations of elements of some set Z. For \u03c6 \u2208 Prop(Z),\nwe write X, \u03c4 |= \u03c6 if \u03c6 evaluates to \u22a4 in the boolean algebra P(X) under a valuation \u03c4 : Z \u2192\nP(X). For \u03c8 \u2208 Prop(\u039b(Z)), the interpretation J\u03c8KT X,\u03c4 of \u03c8 in the boolean algebra P(T X) under\n\u03c4 is the inductive extension of the assignment J\u2665(p1 , . . . , pn )KT X,\u03c4 = J\u2665KX (\u03c4 (p1 ), . . . , \u03c4 (pn )).\nWe write T X, \u03c4 |= \u03c8 if J\u03c8KT X,\u03c4 = T X, and t T\n|=T X,\u03c4 \u03c8 if t \u2208 J\u03c8KT X,\u03c4 . A set of formulas\n\u039e \u2286 Prop(\u039b(Z)) is one-step satisfiable w.r.t. \u03c4 if \u03c6\u2208\u039e J\u03c6KT X,\u03c4 6= \u2205. We occasionally apply this\nnotation to sets Z \u2286 P(X) with \u03c4 being just inclusion, in which case mention of \u03c4 is suppressed.\nIn the sequel, we will be interested in both local and global semantic consequence, where local\nconsequence refers to satisfaction in a single state and global consequence to satisfaction in entire\nmodels. In fact, we consider local reasoning under global assumptions: given a set \u03a6 \u2286 (\u039b) of\nglobal assumptions (a TBox in description logic terminology) and a class C of models, we say that\n\u03c6 is a local consequence of \u03a8 under global assumptions \u03a6 for C-models, in symbols \u03a6; \u03a8 |=C \u03c6,\nif for all M \u2208 C such that M |= \u03a6, M, c |= \u03c6 whenever M, c |= \u03a8 (here, both \u03a6 and \u03a8 are\nsets of arbitrary formulas, in particular not subject to any restrictions on the nesting depth of modal\noperators). The standard notions of local and global consequence are regained from this general\ndefinition by taking \u03a6 or \u03a8 to be empty, respectively.\nThe distinguishing feature of the coalgebraic approach to hybrid and modal logics is the parametricity in both the logical language and the notion of frame: concrete instantiations of the general\nframework, in other words a choice of modal operators \u039b and a \u039b-structure T , capture the syntax\nand semantics of a wide range of modal logics, as witnessed by the following examples.\nExamples 1.1.\n1. The hybrid version of the modal logic K, hybrid K for short, has a single\nunary modal operator \u0003, interpreted over the structure consisting of the powerset functor P (which\ntakes a set X to its powerset P(X)) and the predicate lifting J\u0003KX (A) = {B \u2208 P(X) | B \u2286 A}.\nIt is clear that P-coalgebras (C, \u03b3 : C \u2192 P(C)) are in 1-1 correspondence with Kripke frames, and\nthat the coalgebraic definition of satisfaction specializes to the usual semantics of the box operator.\n\n\f648\n\nL. SCHR\u00d6DER AND D. PATTINSON\n\n2. Graded hybrid logic has modal operators \u2666k 'in more than k successors, it holds that'. It is\ninterpreted over the functor B that P\ntakes a set X to the set B(X) = X \u2192 N \u222a {\u221e} of multisets over\nX by [[\u2666k ]]X (A) = {B \u2208 B(X) | x\u2208A B(x) > k}. This captures the semantics of graded modalities over multigraphs [8], which are precisely the B-coalgebras. A more\nPgeneral set of operators\nis that of Presburger logic [9], which admits integer linear inequalities\nai * #(\u03c6i ) \u2265 k among\nformulas. Unlike in the purely modal case [19], hybrid multigraph semantics visibly differs from\nthe more standard Kripke semantics of graded modalities, as the latter validates all formulas \u00ac\u26661 i,\ni \u2208 N. However, both semantics agree if we additionally stipulate \u00ac\u26661 i as a global (pure) axiom.\nThus, our completeness results for multigraph semantics derived below do transfer to Kripke semantics. In particular they apply to many description logics, which commonly feature both nominals\nand graded modal operators in the guise of qualified number restrictions.\n3. Hybrid CK , the hybrid extension of the basic conditional logic CK , has a single binary\nmodal operator \u21d2, written in infix notation. Hybrid CK is interpreted over the functor Cf that\nmaps a set X to the set P(X) \u2192 P(X), whose coalgebras are selection function models [6], by\nputting [[\u21d2]]X (A, B) = {f : P(X) \u2192 P(X) | f (A) \u2286 B}.\n4. Classical hybrid logic (the hybrid version of the logic E of neighbourhood frames, referred to\nas (the minimal) classical modal logic in [6]) has a single, unary modal operator \u0003 and is interpreted\nover neighbourhood frames, that is, coalgebras for the functor N X = P(P(X)) (more precisely,\nthe double contravariant powerset functor). The semantics of classical modal logic is defined by\nthe lifting J\u0003KX (A) = {S \u2208 N X | A \u2208 S}. Monotone hybrid logic has the same similarity\ntype, but is interpreted over upwards closed neighbourhood frames, or coalgebras for the functor\nM X = {S \u2208 N X | S upwards closed} where upwards closure refers to subset inclusion.\n5. The syntax of coalition logic over a set N of agents is given by the similarity type {[C] | C \u2286\nN }, and the operator [C] reads as \"coalition C has a joint strategy to enforce . . . \". The formulas of\n(hybrid) coalition logic are interpreted over game frames, i.e., coalgebras for the functor\nQ\nQ\nG(X) = {(f, (Si )i\u2208N ) | i\u2208N Si 6= \u2205, f : i\u2208N Si \u2192 X}\n(a class-valued functor, technically speaking, which however does not cause problems). The semantics arises via the liftings\nJ[C]KX (A) = {(f, (Si )i\u2208N ) \u2208 G(X) | \u2203(si )i\u2208C \u2200(si )i\u2208N \\C (f ((si )i\u2208N ) \u2208 A}.\nWe proceed to present a Hilbert-style proof system for coalgebraic hybrid logics, which we prove\nto be sound and strongly complete. This requires that the logic at hand satisfies certain coherence\nconditions between the axiomatization and the semantics - in fact the same conditions as in the\npurely modal case, which are easily verified local properties that can be verified without reference\nto T -models and are already known to hold for a large variety of logics [16, 19].\nProof systems for coalgebraic logics are most conveniently described in terms of one-step rules,\nas follows.\nDefinition 1.2. A one-step rule over \u039b is a rule \u03c6/\u03c8 where \u03c6 \u2208 Prop(P) and \u03c8 \u2208 Prop(\u039b(P))\n(in fact, \u03c8 may be restricted to be a disjunctive clause, which however is not relevant here). The\nrule \u03c6/\u03c8 is one-step sound if T X, \u03c4 |= \u03c8 whenever X, \u03c4 |= \u03c6 for a valuation \u03c4 : P \u2192 P(X).\nGiven a set R of one-step rules and a valuation \u03c4 : P \u2192 P(X), a set \u039e \u2286 Prop(\u039b(P)) is one-step\nconsistent [20] if the set \u039e \u222a {\u03c8\u03c3 | \u03c3 : P \u2192 Prop(P); \u03c6/\u03c8 \u2208 R; X, \u03c4 |= \u03c6\u03c3} is propositionally\nconsistent.\nOne-step sound rules are sound, and we will assume one-step soundness tacitly in the sequel. Completeness hinges on variants of the notion of one-step completeness [19], which we define further\n\n\fNAMED MODELS IN COALGEBRAIC HYBRID LOGIC\n\n649\n\nbelow. As the notion of one-step rule does not involve hybrid features, suitable rule sets can just be\ninherited from the corresponding modal systems; for graded logics, conditional logics, and many\nothers, such rule sets are found, e.g., in [22, 21]. We recall that the one-step complete rule set for\n(hybrid) K consists of the rules\na\u2227b\u2192c\na\n.\n\u0003a\n\u0003a \u2227 \u0003b \u2192 \u0003c\nA set R of one-step rules now gives rise to a Hilbert system LR by adjoining propositional tautologies and the hybrid axioms, and closing under modus ponens, rule application, and @-necessitation.\nFormally, we write \u03a6 \u22a2LR \u03c6 for a set \u03a6 of formulas, the global assumptions (or the TBox), and a\nformula \u03c6 if \u03c6 is contained in the smallest set that\n\u2022 contains \u03a6 and all instances of propositional tautologies\n\u2022 contains all instances of @-introduction i \u2227 \u03c6 \u2192 @i \u03c6 and make-or-break\n(mob) @i p \u2192 (\u2665(q1 , . . . , qn ) \u2194 \u2665(@i p \u2227 q1 , . . . , @i p \u2227 qn ))\ntogether with all instances of the axioms \u00ac@i \u22a5, \u00ac@i \u03c6 \u2194 @i \u00ac\u03c6, @i (\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2194 (@i \u03c6 \u2227\n@i \u03c8)), @i i, @i j \u2194 @j i, @i k \u2227 @j p \u2192 @i p; and\n\u2022 is closed under instances of @-generalization p/@i p, instances of rules in R, and modus\nponens.\nThe second group of axioms ensures that i \u223c j :\u2261 @i j defines an equivalence relation on nominals\nand that @i distributes over propositional connectives. The (mob) axiom captures the fact that the\ntruth set of an @-formula is either empty or the whole model; in the case of hybrid K, it is equivalent\nto the standard back axiom @i \u03c6 \u2192 \u0003@i \u03c6.\nWe write \u03a6; \u03a8 \u22a2LR \u03c6 if there are \u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8n \u2208 \u03a8 such that \u03a6 \u22a2LR \u03c81 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03c8n \u2192 \u03c6.\nThat is, \u03a6; \u03a8 \u22a2LR \u03c6 if there is a proof of \u03c6 from global assumptions \u03a6 that additionally assumes\n\u03a8 locally. As we assume that all one-step rules in R are one-step sound, soundness for both local\nand global consequence is immediate: we have \u03a6; \u03a8 |=C \u03c6 (for C the class of all models) whenever\n\u03a6; \u03a8 \u22a2LR \u03c6. In [14], a criterion has been given for LR to be weakly complete, i.e. complete for\nthe case where both the TBox \u03a6 and the set \u03a8 of local assumptions are empty. Here, we extend\nthis result to combined strong global and strong local completeness, i.e. to cover both an arbitrary\nTBox and an arbitrary set of local assumptions, even if LR is extended with pure frame conditions\nand local binding.\n\n2. Strong Completeness of Pure Extensions\nPure completeness is a celebrated result in hybrid logic [3, Chapter 7.3]. In a nutshell, adding\npure axioms to an already complete proof system for the hybrid extension of the modal logic K\n(Example 1.1), one retains completeness with respect to the class of frames that satisfy the additional\naxioms. In contrast to arbitrary modal axioms, pure axioms do not contain propositional variables,\nand therefore define \u2013 in the classical setting of hybrid K \u2013 first-order frame conditions. Here, we\nshow that the same theorem is valid for a much larger class of logics, namely all coalgebraic hybrid\nlogics satisfying one of two suitable sets of conditions. For the sake of readability, we restrict\nthe technical development (not the examples) to the case of unary operators from now on until\nSection 2.2.\nDefinition 2.1. If A is a set of pure formulas and R is a set of one-step rules, we write\n\u03a6; \u03a8 \u22a2LRA+Name \u03c6 if there are \u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8n \u2208 \u03a8 such that \u03c81 \u2227 . . . \u03c8n \u2192 \u03c6 is LR-derivable\n\n\f650\n\nL. SCHR\u00d6DER AND D.

As before, we write \u03a6 \u22a2LRA+Name \u03c6 if \u03a6; \u2205 \u22a2LRA+Name \u03c6.\nIn the above system, the rule (Name\u2032 ) @i \u03c6/\u03c6 (i \u2208\n/ N(\u03c6) and the rule\n@j (\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8)\n(j \u2208\n/ N(\u03c6, \u03c8))\n\u2665\u03c6 \u2194 \u2665\u03c8\nare derivable. The system is clearly sound for both global and local consequence over A-models in\nthe same sense that LR is sound over T -models.\n(NameCong)\n\nDefinition 2.2. Let A \u2286 (\u039b) be a set of pure axioms, and let \u03a6 \u2286 (\u039b) be a TBox. A set\n\u03a8 \u2286 (\u039b) is (LRA + Name)-\u03a6-inconsistent if there are \u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8n \u2208 \u03a8 such that \u03a6 \u22a2LRA+Name\n\u00ac(\u03c81 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03c8n ). Otherwise, \u03a8 is (LRA + Name)-\u03a6-consistent. A subset of @F(\u039b), i.e. a set\nof @-formulas, is called an ABox (again borrowing terminology from description logic). A maximally (LRA + Name)-\u03a6-consistent ABox is a maximal element K among the (LRA + Name)\u03a6-consistent ABoxes, ordered by inclusion. For such a K, we write SK = {Ki | i \u2208 N}, where\nKi = {\u03c6 \u2208 (\u039b) | @i \u03c6 \u2208 K}, and put VK (i) = {Ki } = {Kj \u2208 SK | i \u2208 Kj }.\nFor the construction of a named model, we now fix a maximally (LRA+Name)-\u03a6-consistent ABox\nK. Later, we will take K to be a maximally consistent extension of a given set \u03a6 of formulas, where\nwe may assume, thanks to the rule (Name\u2032 ), that \u03a6 \u2286 @(\u039b). We note the following trivial facts:\nLemma 2.3. We have \u03c8\u03c3 \u2208 Ki for all \u03c8 \u2208 A and all substitutions \u03c3, and moreover K \u222a \u03a6 \u2286 Ki .\nOur goal is the construction of named canonical models in the following sense:\nDefinition 2.4. A named canonical K-model is a model (SK , \u03b3, VK ) such that\n\u03b3(Ki ) \u2208 [[\u2665]]\u03c6\u0302 iff \u2665\u03c6 \u2208 Ki\nfor every nominal i, where \u03c6\u0302 = {Kj \u2208 SK | \u03c6 \u2208 Kj }.\nIt is clear that named canonical models are countable, as there are only countably many nominals.\nLemma 2.5 (Truth lemma for named canonical models). If M = (SK , \u03b3, VK ) is a named canonical\nK-model and \u03c6 is a hybrid formula, then for every Ki \u2208 SK ,\nM, Ki |= \u03c6 iff\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 Ki .\n\nHence, M |= \u03a6, and M is an A-model.\nThe last clause of the truth lemma follows from Lemma 2.3, the crucial point being that satisfaction\nof all substitution instances of A implies frame satisfaction of A because every state in the model\nis denoted by some nominal. We now establish two criteria for the existence of named canonical\nmodels. The first criterion assumes a stronger form of one-step completeness than the second, which\ninstead demands that the modalities are bounded.\n\n\fNAMED MODELS IN COALGEBRAIC HYBRID LOGIC\n\n651\n\n2.1. Pure Completeness for Strongly One-Step Complete Logics\nThe construction of named models hinges on the following notion of pastedness, which assures that\nnominals interact correctly across the whole model. For the rest of the section, we fix a one-step\ncomplete rule set R, a set A of pure axioms, and a set \u03a6 \u2286 (\u039b) of global assumptions, and we write\n'consistent' instead of '(LRA + Name)-\u03a6\u2013consistent'.\nDefinition 2.6. An ABox K is 0-pasted if whenever @j (\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) \u2208 K for all nominals j, then\n@i (\u2665\u03c6 \u2194 \u2665\u03c8) \u2208 K for all nominals i.\nIt is clear that K can induce a named model only if K is 0-pasted. The construction of pasted\nABoxes requires a Henkin-like extension of the logical language by adding new nominals. Generally, we denote by (\u039b)+ an extended language with countably many new nominals not appearing in\n(\u039b). We note the fact (slightly glossed over in the literature) that this extension is conservative:\nLemma 2.7. If \u03a8 \u2286 (\u039b) is consistent, then \u03a8 remains consistent in (\u039b)+ .\nLemma 2.8 (Extended Lindenbaum lemma for 0-Pasted Sets). If \u03a8 \u2286 F(\u039b) is consistent, then\nthere exists a 0-pasted maximally consistent ABox K \u2286 @(\u039b)+ and a nominal i in (\u039b)+ such that\n@i \u03a8 \u2286 K.\n(The proof of the above version of the Lindenbaum lemma uses Lemma 2.7, and exploits the Name\u2032\nrule to introduce the nominal i.) As we are aiming for strong completeness results, (weak) one-step\ncompleteness as employed in weak completeness proofs using finite models [14, 19] is no longer\nadequate. Accordingly, our first criterion assumes a stronger condition:\nDefinition 2.9. A rule set R is strongly one-step complete if for every set X, every one-step consistent subset of Prop(\u039b(P(X))) is one-step satisfiable.\nLemma 2.10 (Named existence lemma, Version 1). If K is 0-pasted and R is strongly one-step\ncomplete, then there exists a named canonical K-model.\nIn summary, we have:\nTheorem 2.11. If R is strongly one-step complete, then every extension of LR by pure axioms is\nboth globally and locally strongly complete over countable hybrid models when equipped with the\nName rule. That is, if \u03a6, \u03a8 \u2286 (\u039b) and \u03c6 \u2208 (\u039b), then \u03a6; \u03a8 \u22a2LRA+Name \u03c6 whenever \u03a6; \u03a8 |=C \u03c6,\nwhere C is the class of countable A-models.\nProof. As usual, we show that every (LRA + Name)-\u03a6-consistent set \u03a8 \u2286 (\u039b) is satisfiable in\na countable A-model M such that M |= \u03a6 (where satisfiability is clearly invariant under passing\nfrom (\u039b) to (\u039b)+ ). The extended Lindenbaum lemma yields a 0-pasted maximally consistent subset\nABox K \u2286 (\u039b)+ and a nominal i in (\u039b)+ such that @i \u03a8 \u2286 K. By the named existence lemma,\nwe find a named, hence countable, canonical K-model M = (SK , \u03b3, VK ), and by the truth lemma\n(Lemma 2.5), M is an A-model, M |= \u03a6, and M, Ki |= \u03a8.\nRemark 2.12. In the literature (e.g. [3, Theorem 7.29]), the above completeness theorem is sometimes phrased as \"completeness with respect to named models\", i.e. models where every state is\nthe denotation of some nominal; such models also played a central role in the early development of\nhybrid logic by the Sofia school (see e.g. [15]). In detail, this means that every state of the model\nis the denotation of a nominal in a language extended with countably many new nominals. This\nextension is necessary, as otherwise the consistent set {\u00acn | n \u2208 N} would be satisfiable in a\nmodel where every state is named by a nominal n \u2208 N of the original language, which is clearly\n\n\f652\n\nL. SCHR\u00d6DER AND D. PATTINSON\n\nimpossible. Completeness with respect to models where every state is named by a nominal in an\nextended language, on the other hand, is an immediate consequence of completeness with respect\nto countable models.\nExample 2.13. The previous theorem establishes strong completeness results for pure extensions\nof all hybrid logics with neighbourhood semantics (Example 1.1.4) that are defined by rank-1 axioms [20], i.e. modal formulas where the nesting depth of modalities is uniformly equal to 1 (such\nas the monotonicity axiom \u0003(a \u2227 b) \u2192 \u0003b). For the monotonic cases, i.e. extensions of monotonic\nhybrid logic, these results are essentially known [24], while they seem to be new for the nonmonotonic cases, i.e. extensions of classical hybrid logic not containing the monotonicity axiom,\nincluding, e.g., various deontic logics [12]. Moreover, the theorem newly proves strong completeness of the hybridization of coalition logic, as Theorem 3.2 of [17] essentially states that coalition\nlogic satisfies strong one-step completeness.\n2.2. Pure Completeness for Bounded Logics\nThe condition of strong one-step completeness used in the previous section is a comparatively rare\nphenomenon [20]; the strength of the condition becomes clear in the fact that, unlike in the classical\ncase of Kripke semantics, the above did not require a notion of 1-pastedness [5]. We proceed to\npresent an alternative approach for the case where one does have an analogue of the (Paste-1) rule\n- this is the case if the operators are bounded, i.e., their satisfaction hinges, in each case, on only\nfinitely and boundedly many states of a model.\nDefinition 2.14. A modal operator \u2665 is k-bounded for k \u2208 N with respect to a \u039b-structure T if for\nevery set X and every A \u2286 X,\nS\n[[\u2665]]X (A) = B\u2286A,#B\u2264k [[\u2665]]X (B).\n(This implies in particular that \u2665 is monotonic.) We say that \u039b is bounded w.r.t. T if every modal\noperator \u2665 in \u039b is k\u2665 -bounded for some k\u2665 .\nThe boundedness of an operator can now be internalized in the logical deduction system. In particular, for k-bounded operators \u2665, one has the paste rule\n@j1 \u03c6 \u2227 * * * \u2227 @jk \u03c6 \u2227 @i \u2665(j1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 jk ) \u2192 \u03c8\n(Paste\u2665(k))\n@i \u2665\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8\nwith the side condition that the jr are pairwise distinct fresh nominals.\nWe write\n\u03a6 \u22a2LRA+Name+Paste \u03c6 if \u03c6 is derivable from assumptions in \u03a6 in the system LR + Name where\nadditionally the rule (Paste\u2665(k)) may be used in deductions for k-bounded operators \u2665. This induces the notion of (LRA+Name +Paste)-\u03a6-consistency, which we briefly refer to as consistency\nas we fix \u03a6, A, and R throughout. Again, the system is clearly sound, i.e. \u03a6; \u03a8 |=C \u03c6 whenever\n\u03a6; \u03a8 \u22a2LRA+Name+Paste \u03c6, where C is the class of A-models.\nExamples 2.15.\n1. Hybrid K. The modal operator \u2666 is 1-bounded. The arising paste rule\n(Paste\u2666(1)) is precisely the rule (paste\u2666) of [4].\n2. Graded hybrid logic. The modal operator \u2666k is (k + 1)-bounded. One thus has a paste rule\n(Paste\u2666k (k + 1))\nwith side conditions as before.\n\n@j1 \u03c6 \u2227 * * * \u2227 @jk+1 \u03c6 \u2227 @i \u2666k (j1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 jk+1 ) \u2192 \u03c8\n@i \u2666k \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8\n\n\fNAMED MODELS IN COALGEBRAIC HYBRID LOGIC\n\n653\n\nP\n3. Positive Presburger hybrid logic. A Presburger operator\nai * #( i ) \u2265 k (Example 1.1) is\nk-bounded if the ai are positive. E.g., this still allows expressing the statement, generally believed\nto be valid in the German national football league, that a team that has at least 37 points will not be\nrelegated: 3 * #win + 1 * #draw \u2265 37 \u2192 \u00acrelegated.\nThe generalized 1-pastedness condition for bounded operators is as follows.\nDefinition 2.16. Let \u039b be bounded. An ABox K is 1-pasted if whenever \u2665 is k-bounded and\n@i \u2665\u03c6 \u2208 K, then {@j1 \u03c6, . . . , @jk \u03c6, @i \u2665(j1 \u2228 * * * \u2228 jk )} \u2286 K for some nominals j1 , . . . , jk .\nAgain, it is clear that if \u039b is bounded, then K can induce a named model only of K is 1-pasted. It is\neasy to see that if R is one-step complete and \u039b is bounded (in fact already if R derives monotony\nfor every \u2665 \u2208 \u039b), then every 1-pasted set is also 0-pasted (Definition 2.6).\nLemma 2.17 (Extended Lindenbaum lemma for 1-pasted sets). Let \u039b be bounded. If \u03a8 \u2286 F(\u039b) is\nconsistent, then there exist a 1-pasted maximally consistent ABox K \u2286 @(\u039b)+ and a nominal i in\n(\u039b)+ such that @i \u03a8 \u2286 K, where (\u039b)+ is as in Section 2.1.\nBounded operators now allow us to use a weaker version of one-step completeness. Instead of\nrequiring that all one-step consistent sets are one-step satisfiable, we may restrict to finite extensions\nof propositional variables.\nDefinition 2.18. We say that R is strongly finitary one-step complete if for every set X, every\none-step consistent subset of Prop(\u039b(Pfin (X))) is one-step satisfiable.\nClearly, any strongly one-step complete rule set is also strongly finitary one-step complete, but the\nexample of graded hybrid logic witnesses that the converse is not true. We note that the weaker\ncriterion still fails for probabilistic logics due to inherent non-compactness [23]; probabilistic logics\nalso fail to be bounded, as a given probability p \u2208 [0, 1] can be split into any number of summands.\nTogether with boundedness, the above condition enables a second version of the named existence\nlemma.\nLemma 2.19 (Named existence lemma, Version 2). If \u039b is bounded, R is strongly finitary one-step\ncomplete, and K is 1-pasted, then there exists a named canonical K-model.\nSummarizing the above, we have the following extended completeness result.\nTheorem 2.20. Let \u039b be bounded, and let R be strongly finitary one-step complete. Then every\nextension of LR by pure axioms is globally and locally strongly complete over countable hybrid\nmodels when equipped with the Name and Paste rules. In other words, if \u03a6, \u03a8 \u2286 (\u039b), \u03c6 \u2208 (\u039b),\nand C is the class of all countable A-models, then \u03a6; \u03a8 \u22a2LRA+Name+Paste \u03c6 whenever \u03a6; \u03a8 |=C \u03c6.\nThe proof follows the same route via extended Lindenbaum lemma, existence lemma, and truth\nlemma as for Theorem 2.11.\nExample 2.21. By Example 2.15 and the fact that the known complete axiomatizations of the\nassociated modal logics are in fact strongly finitary one-step complete, the previous theorem proves\ncompleteness of pure extensions of hybrid K, graded hybrid logic, and positive Presburger hybrid\nlogic. Except for the standard case of hybrid K, these results seem to be new. In particular, we\nobtain completeness of pure extensions of graded (or positive Presburger) hybrid logic defining the\nfollowing frame classes in multigraph semantics:\n\u2022 The class of Kripke frames, seen as the class of multigraphs where the transition multiplicity\nbetween two individual states is always at most 1, defined by the pure axiom \u00ac\u26661 i.\n\n\f654\n\nL.

The Mixed Case\nIn some cases, the two methods laid out in the preceding sections can be combined for modal\noperators with several arguments that adhere, in each of their arguments, to one of the respective\nsets of semantic conditions. For the sake of readability, we formulate this explicitly only for the\nmixed binary case with a single modal operator, i.e. we assume in this section that \u039b = {\u2665} with\n\u2665 binary; the generalization to arbitrary numbers of arguments, several modal operators etc. should\nbe obvious, and essentially only requires more elaborate terminology and notation.\nDefinition 2.22. We say that R is (strongly, strongly finitary) one-step complete if every one-step\nconsistent subset of Prop(\u039b(P(X) \u00d7 Pfin (X))) is one-step satisfiable. Moreover, we say that \u2665 is\nk-bounded\nin the second argument for k \u2208 N if for every set X and all A, B \u2286 X, [[\u2665]]X (A, B) =\nS\nC\u2286A,#C\u2264k [[\u2665]]X (A, C).\nIn the same manner as for Theorems 2.11 and 2.20, we derive:\nTheorem 2.23. If R is (strongly, strongly finitary) one-step complete and \u2665 is k-bounded in the\nsecond argument, then every extension of LR by pure axioms is both locally and globally strongly\ncomplete over countable hybrid models when equipped with the appropriate Name and Paste rules.\nExample 2.24. Hybrid CK (Example 1.1) is easily seen to be (strongly, strongly finitary) one-step\ncomplete, and the operator > defined from the conditional operator \u21d2 by a > b :\u2194 \u00ac(a \u21d2 \u00acb)\nis 1-bounded in the second argument. By the above, it follows that every pure extension of hybrid\nCK is strongly complete over countable hybrid selection function models. E.g. we may define\nthe class of conditional frames where all expressible conditions induce transitive relations by pure\naxioms (\u03c6 > \u03c6 > i) \u2192 (\u03c6 > i). Such frames satisfy also the dual axiom (using a propositional\nvariable a) (\u03c6 \u21d2 a) \u2192 (\u03c6 \u21d2 (\u03c6 \u21d2 a)), an axiom for duplicating conditional assumptions. Similar\nstatements apply to a combination of graded and conditional logic (obtainable compositionally using\nthe methods of [21]), which has operators of the form a \u21d2k b \"if a, then one normally has more\nthan k instances of b\".\nThe semantics of conditional logics in general has complex ramifications, involving, e.g., preference orderings or systems of spheres (see, e.g., [10, 18]); application of our methods to conditional\nlogics beyond CK is the subject of further investigation. We note that pure completeness of a hybrid\nextension of Lewis' logic of counterfactuals has been established recently [18].\n\n3. Local Binding\nWe next investigate completeness of a stronger hybrid language that includes the \u2193 binder, which\nbinds a state variable to the current state. Concretely, we allow formulas of the form \u2193 i. \u03c6, wherein\nthe nominal i is locally bound (for compactness of presentation, we give up the usual distinction\nbetween nominals and state variables). Given a modal similarity type \u039b, we write \u2193 (\u039b) for the\n\n\fNAMED MODELS IN COALGEBRAIC HYBRID LOGIC\n\n655\n\nensuing extension of (\u039b). The reading of the formula \u2193 i.\u03c6 is \"\u03c6 holds for the current state i\". The\nsatisfaction relation in the extended logic is defined by an additional clause for the \u2193 binder,\n(C, \u03b3, V ) |=\u2193 i. \u03c6 iff (C, \u03b3, V [c/i]) |= \u03c6\nwhere c is a state in a coalgebra C and V [c/i] is obtained from V by modifying the value of i to c.\nThe semantics of the \u2193 binder immediately translates into the axiom scheme (see e.g. [4])\n(DA)\n\n@i ((\u2193 j. \u03c6) \u2194 \u03c6[i/j]).\n\nGiven a set R of \u039b-rules, a set \u03a6 \u2286\u2193 (\u039b) of formulas and a set A \u2286 @\u2193 (\u039b) of pure axioms,\nwe write \u03a6 \u22a2LRA+Name+Paste+DA \u03c6 for the extension of the associated provability predicate\n\u22a2LRA+Name+Paste with (DA). Using (DA), one easily proves an extension of the truth lemma\nfor named models (Lemma 2.5) to \u2193 (\u039b), so that the completeness results for pure extensions proved\nbefore (Theorems 2.11, 2.20, and 2.23) transfer immediately to L\u2193 . We make this explicit for the\nbounded case:\nTheorem 3.1. If \u039b is bounded and R is strongly finitary one-step complete, then every pure extension of L\u2193 is strongly locally and globally complete over countable hybrid models. In other words,\n\u03a6; \u03a8 |=C \u03c6 iff \u03a6; \u03a8 \u22a2LRA+Name+Paste+DA \u03c6 for all \u03c6 \u2208\u2193 (\u039b) and all \u03a6, \u03a8 \u2286 (\u039b), where C is the\nclass of all countable A-models.\nRemark 3.2. As noted in [24], the named model construction more generally yields completeness\nfor any locally definable extension of the hybrid language, i.e. any extension whose semantics at\nnamed states is defined by a formula similar to (DA).\nExample 3.3. Continuing Example 2.15, Theorem 3.1 reproves not only the known completeness\nof pure extensions of hybrid K with \u2193, but also the completeness of pure extensions of graded (or\npositive Presburger) hybrid logic with \u2193. This extends easily to the multi-agent case, or, in description logic terminology, to description logics with multiple roles. As, moreover, both a role hierarchy\nand transitivity of roles can be defined using pure axioms, we thus arrive at a complete axiomatization of an extension of the description logic SHOQ with satisfaction operators and \u2193, which has\nbeen used in connection with conjunctive query answering [11], and allows, e.g., talking about the\nnumber of stepchildren of a stepmother, in continuation of the stepmother example from [13], .\n\n4. Conclusions\nWe have laid out two criteria for the existence of named canonical models in coalgebraic hybrid\nlogics - one that applies to cases where one has an analogue of the so-called Paste-1 rule of standard hybrid logic, and one which applies to cases where one does not need any such rule. While\nthe latter means essentially that the logic is equipped with a neighbourhood semantics, the former\nrequires that all modal operators of the logic are bounded, i.e. there is always only a bounded number of states relevant for their satisfaction at each point. Our main novel example of this type is\ngraded hybrid logic (and an extension of it using certain Presburger modalities [9]). The named\nmodel construction entails completeness of pure extensions and completeness of extended hybrid\nlanguages with the local binder \u2193 (of which the I\u2013me construct of [13] is a single-variable restriction), which we thus obtain as new results for, e.g., hybrid coalition logic, hybrid classical modal\nlogic, several hybrid deontic logics, hybrid conditional logic, graded hybrid logic, and an extension\nof the description logic SHOQ. An open question that remains is the existence of so-called orthodox axiomatizations [4] in the presence of \u2193, as well as to find an analogue of the characterization\nresult of [24] stating that a variant of the Paste-1 rule characterizes the Kripke models among the\n\n\f656\n\nL. SCHR\u00d6DER AND D. PATTINSON\n\ntopological models of S4. A further topic of investigation is to find decidable fragments of the language with \u2193; we note slightly speculatively that the fragment used in [13] may, in our terminology,\nbe seen as requiring that a suitably defined NNF of a formula contains only positive occurrences of\nbound nominals under bounded modal operators.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.
