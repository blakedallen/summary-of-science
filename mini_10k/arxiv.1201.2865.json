Our theoretical findings can be verified in the laboratory with current technology.\n\nIntroduction In information theory the relation between two events can be quantified using the notion of\nconditional entropy. This notion was successfully applied to study the relation between space-like separated\nmeasurements on different parts of an entangled quantum system and it was shown that conditional entropies\nfor measurements on such systems do not obey classical\nproperties of entropy [1], which is yet another manifestation of quantum nonlocality [2]. Since quantum nonlocality is only a special case of quantum contextuality\n[3] it is natural to ask whether classical properties of entropy also fail do describe measurements in contextual\nscenarios.\nThe notion of contextuality, as introduced by Kochen\nand Specker (KS) [3], can be explained as follows. Suppose that a measurement A can be jointly performed with\neither B or C. Measurements B and C are said to provide a context for the measurement A. The measurement\nA is contextual if its outcome does depend on whether it\nwas performed together with B or with C. Therefore, the\nessence of contextuality is the lack of possibility to assign\nan outcome to A prior to its measurement and independently of the context in which it was performed. The\ncrucial observation by KS [3] was that quantum theory\nis contextual for any system whose dimension is greater\nthan two. The seemingly different Bell theorem [4] is in\nfact a special instance of the KS theorem where contexts\nnaturally arise from the spatial separation of measurements.\nIn mathematical terms quantum nonlocality and contextuality can be formulated in terms of probability\ntheory. Specifically, the reason behind both Bell and\nKS theorems is the lack of joint probability distribution for all measured observables [5\u20137]. For example,\nimagine some physical system on which one can perform various measurements denoted by A1 , A2 , . . . , AN .\nEach measurement Ai yields an outcome ai,ji (where ji\nenumerates outcomes) with probability p(Ai = ai,ji ).\nThe non-contextuality hypothesis is true if and only\nif there exists a joint probability distribution for the\noutcomes of all observations, i.e., p(A1 = a1,j1 , A2 =\n\na2,j2 , . . . , AN = aN,jN ), such that one can recover all the\nmeasurable probabilities as its marginals. For instance,\nconsider that the subset of measurements {Ak1 , . . . , Akl }\nwith {k1 , . . . , kl } \u2286 {1, . . . , N } can be jointly performed,\nin other words, the probability distribution p(Ak1 =\nak1 ,jk1 , . . . , Akl = akl ,jkl ) can be experimentally determined. The non-contextuality hypothesis then requires\nthat the joint probability distribution for all measurements, p(A1 = a1,j1 , A2 = a2,j2 , . . . , AN = aN,jN ) recovers any such p(Ak1 = ak1 ,jk1 , . . . , Akl = akl ,jkl ) as its\nmarginal, i.e.,\np(Ak1 = ak1 ,jk1 , . . . , Akl = akl ,jkl ) =\nX\np(A1 = a1,j1 , . . . , AN = aN,jN ).\n\u0101k,jk\n\nHere the summation is over the outcomes of all the measurements Aj that are not in the jointly measurable subset. From hereon, we denote probabilities by p(Ai ) instead of p(Ai = ai ) for notational convenience, wherever\nthere is no possibility of confusion.\nAn important question is the minimal number of\nmeasurements on some quantum system that one has\nto perform in order to observe contextuality and prevent the existence of their joint probability distribution.\nThe currently known most economic proofs for a threedimensional system (qutrit) consist of 5 measurements\nin case of a state-dependent test [8] and of 13 measurements in case of a state-independent test [9]. Qutrits\nare of special interest since they are not only the smallest contextual systems, but they also physically correspond to a single system to which the concept of nonlocality and entanglement cannot be unambiguously applied. Therefore, a single qutrit together with the most\neconomic set of contextual measurements can be considered as a primitive of quantum contextuality in a similar sense as an entangled pair of qubits together with\nthe CHSH (Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt) inequality [10]\nis considered as a primitive of quantum nonlocality.\nIn this Letter we analytically find the minimal number of contextual measurements for a single qutrit. A\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Graphical notation of commutation relations. Vertices of the graph correspond to observables and edges represent commutativity.\n\nnew graph theoretical method to construct joint probability distributions is presented and it is proven that for\nsets of measurements whose corresponding graphs do not\ncontain cycles (i.e., there are no subsets of measurements\nthat cyclic-commute) there always exists a joint probability distribution reproducing quantum marginals. Next,\nusing the minimal set of measurements we formulate an\nentropic contextual inequality in the spirit of [1]. Finally,\nwe find measurement settings for an optimal violation of\nthis inequality for a single qutrit.\nMinimal number of contextual measurements In order to find the minimal number of contextual measurements one is tempted to start with two measurements\nA and B. However, this does not work because (i)\neither A and B commute in which case quantum mechanics itself provides a joint probability distribution,\nor (ii) A and B do not commute and one can simply\nwrite p(A, B) = p(A)p(B), a joint probability that reproduces the marginal probabilities p(A) and p(B). Observe that a single particle in one dimension for which\nmeasurements of position and momentum do not commute is not contextual because of (ii). Next, consider\nthree measurements: A, B and C. The various scenarios\nare as follows: (i) All three measurements mutually commute, which is equivalent to (i) for two measurements (ii)\nAll of them do not commute, which allows us to define\np(A, B, C) = p(A)p(B)p(C) (iii) Only one pair commutes\n(A and B) in which case the joint probability distribution\nis p(A, B, C) = p(A, B)p(C), where p(A, B) is provided\nby quantum mechanics. (iv) One pair of them (B and\nC) does not commute in which case one may construct\np(A, B, C) = p(A, B)p(A, C)/p(A). This joint probability\ndistribution reproduces all measurable marginals, therefore the system that has only two contexts is not sufficient to refute non-contextuality. The next case of four\nmeasurements was shown to be sufficient to prove this\ndiscrepancy for a system of dimension at least four, and\nis known as the CHSH inequality [10].\nCan we show the discrepancy for a three-level system and only four measurements? To show that the\nanswer is no, it is convenient to introduce graphic notation as in Fig. 1. Each vertex represents a measurement and edges represent commutation between the\nconnected measurements. The only significant scenar-\n\nios that do not reduce to previous considerations are\nrepresented by the chain graph (in Fig. 1 (i)), the\nstar graph (ii) and the cycle (iii). For (i) we construct\np(A, B, C, D) = p(A, B)p(B, C)p(C, D)/(p(B)p(C)), for\n(ii) p(A, B, C, D) = p(A, B)p(A, C)p(A, D)/(p(A)p(A)).\nNote that the probabilities on the right-hand side of these\nequations exist due to the assumption of joint measurability. Measurements corresponding to the graph in Fig.\n1 (iii) do not exist for a three-level system. This is because in order to have [A, B] = 0 and [A, D] = 0, but\n[B, D] 6= 0 one requires A to be a degenerate operator.\nIn the case of a three-level system, this means that two\neigenvalues of A are the same and therefore, without loss\nof generality A can be set to be a projector of rank one.\nTherefore all four measurements A, B, C and D are rank\none projectors. The cycle graph (iii) implies that both A\nand C are orthogonal to B and D. Since we require that\nB 6= D, these two projectors span a plane orthogonal to\nboth A and C which in three-dimensional Hilbert space\nimplies A = C. The problem then reduces to case (iii)\nfor three measurements.\nFor three-level systems one requires at least five projective measurements to show the lack of joint probability\ndistribution. Before we proceed, let us prove one property of the construction used above, namely that for any\ncommutation graph which does not contain cycles (tree\ngraph) there always exits a joint probability distribution\nconsistent with quantum theory. This construction is\ngiven by the product of probability distributions corresponding to the edges of the graph (denoted by the set\nE(G)) divided by the product of probabilities of common\nvertices, where a vertex i \u2208 V (G) (the set of vertices of\nthe graph) of degree d(i) (the number of nearest neighbors) appears d(i) \u2212 1 times in the product, i.e.,\nQ\n(i,j)\u2208E(G) p(Ai , Aj )\n.\np(A1 , . . . , AN ) = Q\nd(i)\u22121\ni\u2208V (G) p(Ai )\nSince quantum theory provides joint probability distributions for any two commuting observables, this construction recovers any measurable marginal as can be seen by\nsumming over all other observables, starting the summation from the leaves (free ends of the tree). For example,\nfor the instance presented in Fig. 2 (i) the joint probability distribution is\np(A1 , A2 )p(A1 , A3 )p(A2 , A4 )p(A2 , A5 )\np(A1 )p(A2 )2\np(A3 , A6 )p(A3 , A7 )\n\u00d7\np(A3 )2\n\np(A1 , . . . , A7 ) =\n\nand for instance to recover p(A2 , A5 ) the summation order is A7 , A6 , A4 , A3 , A1 . In fact, the construction can\nalso be applied to the scenario when the commutation\ngraph apart from the tree structure also contains cliques\n(a clique is a fully conntected subgraph which by definition is a jointly measurable subset).\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Two examples of graphs of observables admitting\njoint probability distributions.\n\nSince all open graphs are trees for which joint probability distribution exists and for a three-level system one\nrequires at least five projective measurements, the minimal graph for which one can show the discrepancy is a\npentagon (5-cycle). For other graphs with cycles smaller\nthan five, such as the example in Fig. 2 (ii), one can\nalways find joint probability distributions, for example\np(A1 , . . . , A5 ) =\n\np(A1 , A2 , A3 )p(A3 , A4 )p(A4 , A5 )\n.\np(A3 )p(A4 )\n\nThe similar case with a square (4-cycle) does not work\ndue to reasons already discussed. This analytic result\nconfirms observation in [8] that projectors corresponding\nto the 5-cycle are necessary and sufficient to reveal the\ncontextuality of a single three-level system.\nEntropic contextual inequality We now focus on a threelevel system which can physically correspond to spin 1.\nSpin states are represented by rank 1 projectors Asn ,\nwhere s = 0, \u00b11 and n denotes the direction of spin projection. We say that Asn is measured if it is an eigenprojector of the measured observable. It is well known\n2\nfor two\nthat the squares of spin 1 operators Sn2 and Sm\northogonal directions n and m can be jointly measured.\nAn example of the observable corresponding to this mea2\nsurement is Sn2 \u2212 Sm\n. We say that this observable provides the context {A0n , A0m }. However, the same operator\n2\nSn2 can be jointly measured with any other operator Sm\n0,\n0\nwhere m is confined to the plane orthogonal to n, hence\nthere are many contexts for the measurement of A0n .\nLet us derive an entropic contextual inequality analogous to the entropic Bell inequality in [1]. It involves five\nprojectors {A1 , A2 , . . . , A5 } (Ai = |Ai ihAi |) on which we\nimpose cyclic orthogonality restrictions, i.e. Ai Ai+1 = 0,\nwhere the subscript is modulo five. Neighboring projectors are jointly measurable since they are orthogonal. As a result, for every projector Ai there exist two\ncontexts {Ai , Ai\u00b11 }. In case of spin 1 these projectors may correspond to A0i , where i and i \u00b1 1 denote\northogonal directions in real space. Let us start with\nthe assumption that despite the fact that not all projectors are jointly measurable, there exists a joint probability distribution for all five projectors p(A1 , . . . , A5 ).\nThis joint probability distribution is a non-contextual\ndescription of the measurements {Ai }. It is then pos-\n\nFIG. 3: Configuration of projectors leading to maximal violation of the entropic contextual inequality for three-level\nsystems.\n\nsible to define the P\njoint entropy H(A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 , A5 ),\nwhere H(A) = \u2212 a p(A = a) log p(A = a) denotes\nthe Shannon entropy. Two classical properties of the\nShannon entropy are used in the derivation of the entropic contextual inequality as in [1]. The first is the\nchain rule H(A, B) = H(A|B) + H(B) and the second is\nH(A|B) \u2264 H(A) \u2264 H(A, B). The latter inequality has\nthe intuitive interpretation that two random variables\ncannot contain less information than one of them and\nthat conditioning cannot increase information content of\nA. The conditional entropy above is defined as\nX\nH(A|B) =\np(B = b)H(A|B = b),\nb=0,1\n\nwhere the entropy H(A|B = b) is defined like standard\nentropy, but using conditional probabilities p(A = a|B =\nb). The conditional entropy H(A|B) describes the information content of A given the value of B.\nRepeated application of the chain rule yields\nH(A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 , A5 ) = H(A1 |A2 , A3 , A4 , A5 ) +\nH(A2 |A3 , A4 , A5 ) + H(A3 |A4 , A5 ) + H(A4 |A5 ) + H(A5 ).\nUsing the inequality H(A|B) \u2264 H(A) \u2264 H(A, B), one\nthen obtains the entropic contextual inequality\nH(A1 |A5 ) \u2264 H(A1 |A2 )+H(A2 |A3 )+H(A3 |A4 )+H(A4 |A5 ).\n(1)\nWe define the quantity\nC = H(A1 |A5 )\u2212H(A1 |A2 )\u2212H(A2 |A3 )\u2212H(A3 |A4 )\u2212H(A4 |A5 ),\ntherefore the inequality (1) can be rewritten as C \u2264 0.\nFor the three-level system the maximal violation of this\ninequality can be shown to be of magnitude 0.091 bits.\nThe optimal solution can be written as follows with parameters \u03b8 = 0.2366 and \u03c6 = 0.1698 (see Fig. 4 where\n\n\f4\nj\n\n0.4\n\nviolation of the pentagram inequality but the converse is\nnot true.

A further question is to fully analyze the relation between the entropic\ncontextual inequality derived here and the pentagram inequality. It would also be interesting to find optimal\ncommutation graphs that reveal contextuality for given\nsystem dimensions [15].
