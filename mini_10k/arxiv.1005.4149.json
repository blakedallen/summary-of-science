RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, M. A. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, A. TAHZIBI, AND R. URES\nAbstract. We give a description of ergodic components of SRB measures in\nterms of ergodic homoclinic classes associated to hyperbolic periodic points.\nFor transitive surface diffeomorphisms, we prove that there exists at most one\nSRB measure.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper we attempt to give a more accurate description of the ergodic\ncomponents of SRB measures. These measures were introduced by Sinai, Ruelle\nand Bowen in the 70's (see [23, 21, 22, 5]) and are the measures most compatible\nwith the ambient volume when the system is not conservative.\nSinai-Ruelle-Bowen's works showed the existence and some desirable properties of such measures for uniformly hyperbolic systems. Subsequently, SRB measures were shown to exist for many non-hyperbolic systems such as: diffeomorphisms preserving smooth measures ([15]), H\u00e9non's attractors ([3]), attractors\nwith mostly contracting center direction ([16, 4]), mostly expanding case ([1]),\npartially hyperbolic attractors with one-dimensional center ([6], see also [24]),\nwhen u-Gibbs measures are unique ([7, 8]). Most of these results also include a\nproof of uniqueness or at least finiteness of SRB measures. In general, uniqueness\nresults are based on the knowledge of the geometry of the unstable \"foliation\".\nIn this paper, we give a description of the ergodic components of SRB measures\nin terms of ergodic homoclinic classes (see next subsection) associated to periodic\npoints. Ergodic homoclinic classes were introduced by the authors in [19] (see\nalso [18]) for the conservative setting. Although SRB measures have a different\nnature (in general, an SRB measure for f is not SRB for f \u22121 ) we obtain a similar\ndescription that combined with a subtle use of the Sard's Theorem, allows us to\nprove that transitive surface diffeomorphisms have at most one SRB measure.\n1.1. Statement of results. Roughly speaking an SRB measure is an invariant\nmeasure that has a positive Lyapunov exponent a.e. and the decomposition of\nthe measure along unstable manifolds is equivalent to the volume. See 2.4 for a\nprecise definition.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary: 37D25. Secondary: 37D30, 37D35.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nF. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, M. A. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, A. TAHZIBI, AND R. URES\n\nRP\nBy Ledrappier-Young [14], a measure satisfies the entropy formula h\u03bc =\n\u03bbi >0 \u03bbi d\u03bc\nif and only if it is SRB. If all the Lyappunov exponents are non zero \u03bc\u2212almost\neverywhere then \u03bc is called a hyperbolic measure.\nWe call \u03bc a physical measure if the basin of \u03bc, B(\u03bc) has positive Lebesgue\nmeasure, where by definition for every continuous observable \u03c6 : M \u2192 R,\nZ\nn\u22121\n1X\ni\n\u03c6(f (x)) \u2192 \u03c6d\u03bc\nn i=0\nfor every x \u2208 B(\u03bc). These measures describe the asymptotic average behavior of a\nlarge subset of points of the ambient space and are the basis of the understanding\nof dynamics in a statistical sense.\nIn general, using absolute continuity of unstable lamination for C 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphisms, it turns out that any ergodic SRB measure is physical if all of its\nLyapunov exponents are non-zero, see [17]. On the one hand, SRB measures are\nbetter to lead with thanks to the information given by the presence of the positive\nexponent. On the other hand, physical measures carry little information (see [25]\nfor a discussion on the subject). For this reason we focus on the study of SRB\nmeasures.\nIn this paper we give an accurate description for the ergodic components of SRB\nmeasures. We define ergodic homoclinic classes for hyperbolic periodic points\nwhich are \"ergodic\" version of homoclinic classes and prove that ergodic components of hyperbolic measures are in fact ergodic homoclinic classes.\nGiven a hyperbolic periodic point p, let us define the ergodic homoclinic class\nof p, \u039b(p), as the set of regular points x \u2208 M such that\n\nW s (o(p)) t W u (x) 6= \u2205 (1.1)\nW u (o(p)) t W s (x) 6= \u2205 (1.2)\n\nFigure 1. x in the ergodic homoclinic class of p\nHere W s (x) is the Pesin stable manifold of x, that is,\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\ns\nn\nn\nW (x) = y \u2208 M : lim sup\nlog d(f (x), f (y)) < 0\nn\u2192+\u221e n\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SRB MEASURES\n\n3\n\nand W u (x), is Pesin unstable manifold of x. For almost every point, Pesin stable\nand unstable manifolds are, indeed, immersed manifolds.\nNote that we can write an ergodic homoclinic class as the intersection of two\ninvariant sets:\n\u039b(p) = \u039bs (p) \u2229 \u039bu (p)\nwhere \u039bu (p) is the set of regular x satisfying the relation (1.1) and \u039bs (p) is the\nset of regular points x satisfying (1.2) . It is clear that \u039bs (p) and \u039bu (p) are\nrespectively s\u2212saturated and u\u2212saturated.\nTheorem 1.1. Let f : M \u2192 M be a C 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphism over a compact\nmanifold M and \u03bc a hyperbolic SRB measure. If \u03bc(\u039bs (p)) and \u03bc(\u039bu (p)) > 0,\nthen\n\u25e6\n\u039bu (p) \u2282 \u039bs (p),\nMoreover, the restriction of \u03bc to \u039b(p) is ergodic and non-uniformly hyperbolic\nand physical.\nWe can drop the hypothesis of the hyperbolicity of the measure under the\nhypothesis m(\u039bs (p)) > 0 where m is the Lebesgue measure. We also give an\nexample where \u03bc(\u039bs (p)) and \u03bc(\u039bu (p)) > 0 and \u039bu is not a.e. contained in \u039bs . Of\ncourse in such example \u03bc is neither hyperbolic nor ergodic.\nTheorem 1.2. Let f : M \u2192 M be a C 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphism over a compact\nmanifold M and \u03bc an SRB measure. If m(\u039bs (p)) > 0 and \u03bc(\u039bu (p)) > 0, then\n\u25e6\n\n\u039bu (p) \u2282 \u039bs (p),\nMoreover, the restriction of \u03bc to \u039b(p) is a hyperbolic ergodic measure.\nWe mention that a similar result for Lebesgue measure has been proved in [19]\nwithout the hypothesis of hyperbolicity of measure. In fact for Lebesgue measure\n\u25e6\nwe did not assume the hyperbolicity the measure and conclude that \u039bs = \u039bu .\nBut, as we have mentioned before, SRB measures have a different nature. An\nSRB measure for f is not SRB for f \u22121 .\nTheorem 1.1 has the following corollary:\nCorollary 1.3. Let f : M \u2192 M be a C 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphism. If \u03bc(\u039b(p)) > 0 for\na hyperbolic point p, then \u03bc|\u039b(p) is an ergodic component of \u03bc.\nIf \u03bc is a hyperbolic invariant measure, by a result of A. Katok ([13]), (f, \u03bc) is\napproximated by uniformly hyperbolic (homoclinic class of hyperbolic periodic\npoint) sets with \u03bc\u2212measure zero. Using carefully the construction of such periodic\npoints, we prove the following theorem which will be used in the proof of Theorem\n1.7.\nTheorem 1.4. Let f : M \u2192 M be a C 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphism over a compact\nmanifold M and \u03bc a hyperbolic SRB measure. Then for any ergodic component\n\u03bd of \u03bc there exists a hyperbolic periodic point P such that \u03bd(\u039b(P )) = 1.\n\n\f4\n\nF. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, M. A. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, A. TAHZIBI, AND R. URES\n\nFor further use, we state the following simple corollary of the (inclination)\n\u03bb-lemma:\nProposition 1.5. If p, q are homoclinically related then \u039b(p) = \u039b(q).\n1.2. Uniqueness of SRB measures. It is a challenging problem in the Ergodic\nTheory of Dynamical Systems to prove the existence and uniqueness (finiteness)\nof SRB or physical measures.\nIn this paper we show that ergodic homoclinic classes are usefull object to\ndistinguish between different hyperbolic ergodic SRB measures. more precisely:\nTheorem 1.6. Let \u03bc, \u03bd be ergodic SRB measures such that \u03bc(\u039b(p)) = \u03bd(\u039b(p)) =\n1 for some hyperbolic periodic point p then \u03bc = \u03bd.\nIn the two dimensional case, using the above theorem we prove that topological\ntransitivity is enough to guarantee that there exists at most one SRB measure\nfor surface C 2 - diffeomorphisms.\nIt is easy to see that for a surface diffeomorphism any SRB measure is hyperbolic. Indeed take an ergodic SRB measure \u03bc with two Lyapunov exponents\n\u03bb+ > \u03bb\u2212 . By Pesin entropy formula (see Young-Ledrappier [14]) h(\u03bc) = \u03bb+ . Since\nh(\u03bc, f ) = h(\u03bc, f \u22121 ) by Ruelle inequality \u03bb+ \u2264 \u2212\u03bb\u2212 .\nTheorem 1.7. Let f : M \u2192 M be a C 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphism over a compact surface\nM . If f is topologically transitive then there exist at most one SRB measure.\nAn example due to I. Kan (see [12]) shows that the above theorem can not be\ntrue in higher dimensional manifolds. I. Kan constructed a transitive diffeomorphism of T2 \u00d7 [0, 1] with two SRB measures with intermingled basins. Gluing\nalong the boundary torus two of these examples and composing with a diffeomorphism that interchanges the two components a transitive diffeomorphism of T3\nwith two SRB-measures is obtained.\nWe recall that, as a consequence of the absolute continuity of the unstable\n\"foliation\", Lebesgue measure is SRB if there is a positive exponent a.e. (see\n[15]). As a corollary of the above theorem we obtain the following result in the\nconservative setting. We thank F. Ledrappier for observing this point in the\nWorkshop on Partial Hyperbolicity, in Beijing.\nTheorem 1.8. Let f : M \u2192 M be a C 1+\u03b1 volume preserving diffeomorphism\nof a compact surface M with non zero Lyapunov exponents. If f is topologically\ntransitive then it is ergodic.\nObserve that by H. Furstenberg's example ([9]), without the hypothesis of\nnon-vanishing Lyapunov exponents, even minimality is not enough to guarantee\nergodicity. Furstenberg constructs a minimal non-ergodic C \u221e diffeomorphism of\nthe two torus.\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SRB MEASURES\n\n5\n\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. Non-uniform hyperbolicity. Let us review some results about Pesin theory that shall be used in this paper. A good summary of these facts may be\nfound, for instance, in [17] and [14]. For further references, see Katok's paper [13]\nand the book by Barreira and Pesin [2].\nLet f : M \u2192 M be a C 1 diffeomorphism of a compact Riemannian manifold\nof dimension n.

Then, for each l > 1 and small\n\u03b5 > 0, if x \u2208 R\u03b5,l :\nL\ns\ns\n(1) Wloc\n(x) is a disk such that Tx Wloc\n(x) = \u03bb<0 E\u03bb (x)\ns\n(x) is continuous over R\u03b5,l in the C 1 topology\n(2) x 7\u2192 Wloc\ns\nIn particular, the dimension of the disk Wloc\n(x) equals the number of negative\nLyapunov exponents of x. An analogous statement holds for the unstable Pesin\nmanifold.\n\n2.2. Absolute continuity. An important notion behind the criterion we are\ngoing to prove is absolute continuity. Let us state the definitions we will be\nusing. The point of view we follow is similar to that in [14].\nLet \u03be be a partition of the manifold M . We shall call \u03be a measurable partition\nif the quotient space M/\u03be is separated by a countable number of measurable\nsets. For instance, the partition of the 2-torus by lines of irrational slope is not\nmeasurable, while the partition of [0, 1] by singletons is measurable. The quotient\nspace M/\u03be of a Lebesgue space M by a measurable partition \u03be is again a Lebesgue\nspace [20].\nAssociated to each measurable partition \u03be of a Lebesgue space (M, B, m) there\nis a canonical system of conditional measures m\u03bex , which are measures on \u03be(x),\nthe element of \u03be containing x, and with the property that for each A \u2208 B the\nset A \u2229 \u03be(x) is measurable in \u03be(x) for almost all \u03be(x) in M/\u03be, and the function\nx 7\u2192 m\u03bex (A \u2229 \u03be(x)) is measurable, with:\nZ\nm(A) =\nm\u03bex (A \u2229 \u03be(x))dmT\n(2.4)\nM/\u03be\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SRB MEASURES\n\n7\n\nwhere mT is the quotient measure on M/\u03be. For each measurable partition this\ncanonical system of conditional measures is unique (mod 0), i.e. any other system\nis the same for almost all \u03be(x) \u2208 M/\u03be. Conversely, if there is a canonical system\nfor a partition, then the partition is measurable. In our case, we will be interested\nin stable and unstable partitions, note that in general these partitions are not\nmeasurable.\nA measurable partition \u03be is subordinate to the unstable partition W u if for ma.e. we have \u03be(x) \u2282 W u (x), and \u03be(x) contains a neighborhood of x which is open\nin the topology of W u (x).\nDefinition 2.3. m has absolutely continuous conditional measures on unstable manifolds if for every measurable partition \u03be subordinate to W u , m\u03bex << \u03bbux for m-a.e.\nx, where \u03bbux is the Riemannian measure on W u (x) given by the Riemannian structure of W u (x) inherited from M .\nWe are now able to give a definition of SRB-measure.\nDefinition 2.4. An f -invariant probability measure \u03bc is called a Sinai-Bowen\nRuelle (SRB) measure if it has a positive Lyapunov exponent a.e. and absolutely\ncontinuous conditional measures on unstable manifolds. After Ledrappier-Young\n([14]) this is equivalent to having\nR P a positive Lyapunov exponent a.e. and satisfying\nthe Pesin formula, h\u03bc (f ) =\n\u03bb(x)>0 \u03bb(x) d\u03bc.\nNow, take a point x0 \u2208 R, the set of regular points. Assume that x0 has at least\na negative Lyapunov exponent. Take two small discs T and T 0 near x0 which are\ntransverse to W s (x0 ). Then we can define the holonomy map with respect to these\ns\ntransversals as a map h defined on a subset of T such that h(x) = Wloc\n(x) \u2229 T 0 .\nThe domain of h consists of the points x \u2208 T \u2229 R whose stable manifold have\nthe same dimension as W s (x0 ), and which transversely intersect T and T 0 . h is\na bijection.\nDefinition 2.5. We say that the stable partition is absolutely continuous if all\nholonomy maps are measurable and take Lebesgue zero sets of T into Lebesgue\nzero sets of T 0 .\nAbsolute continuity of the unstable partition is defined analogously.\nTheorem 2.6 ([15]). Let f be a C 1+\u03b1 diffeomorphism. Then, its stable and\nunstable partitions are absolutely continuous.\nNote that the holonomy maps of the stable foliation are continuous and have\ncontinuous Jacobians when restricted to the Pesin blocks R\u03b5,l .\n3. Ergodic components and ergodic homoclinic classes\nIn this section we prove all theorems except Theorem 1.7. For the sake of\nsimplicity firstly, we shall prove Corollary 1.3. Let us introduce some lemmas\n\n\f8\n\nF. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, M. A. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, A. TAHZIBI, AND R. URES\n\nbefore entering into its proof.be an SRB-measure. Let \u03bc For any given function\n\u03c6 \u2208 L1\u03bc (M, R), let\nn\u22121\n1X\n\u00b1\n\u03c6\u0303 (x) = lim\n\u03c6(f n (x))\n(3.1)\nn\u2192\u00b1\u221e n\ni=0\nBy Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem, the limit (3.1) exists and \u03c6+ (x) = \u03c6\u2212 (x) for \u03bc\u2212a.e.\nx \u2208 M . Note that \u03c6\u00b1 (x) is f -invariant. Moreover, we have the following:\nLemma 3.1. For all \u03c6 \u2208 C 0 (M ) there exists an invariant set S with \u03bc(S) = 1\nsuch that if x \u2208 S we have \u03c6\u0303+ (w) = \u03c6\u0303+ (x) for all w \u2208 W s (x) and mux -a.e.\nw \u2208 W u (x).\nProof of the Lemma. The proof is completely analogous to the one for smooth\nmeasures since SRB-measures, by definition, have absolutely continuous conditional measures along unstable manifolds.\n\u0003\nProof of Corollary 1.3. Let \u03c6 : M \u2192 R be a continuous function, let S be the set\nobtained in Lemma 3.1 and R the set of \u03bc-regular points. We shall see that \u03c6\u0303+\nis constant on \u039b(p) \u2229 S \u2229 R. This will prove that \u03bc is ergodic when restricted to\n\u039b(p).\nLet x, y \u2208 \u039b(p) \u2229 S \u2229 R\u03b5,l = \u039b for some \u03b5 > 0 and l > 1. Without loss\nof generality we may assume that x and y are in the support of the restriction\nof \u03bc to \u039b and that they return infinitely many times to \u039b. Hence there exists\nn > 0 such that f n (y) \u2208 \u039b and d(f n (y), W u (p)) < \u03b4/2 where \u03b4 > 0 is as in the\ns\ndefinition of transverse absolute continuity. Hence Wloc\n(f n (y)) t W u (p) 6= \u2205. We\ncan suppose for simplicity that n = 0, and that p is a hyperbolic fixed point.\nAs a consequence of the Inclination Lemma, there exists k > 0 such that\ns\nf k (x) \u2208 \u039b and W u (f k (x)) t Wloc\n(y) 6= \u2205. As in the case of smooth measures,\nu\ndue to Lemma 3.1 above, there is a muy -positive measure set of w \u2208 Wloc\n(y) such\n+\n+\ns\nu\nk\n+\nthat \u03c6\u0303 (w) = \u03c6\u0303 (y) and Wloc (w) t W (f (x)) 6= \u2205. Since \u03c6\u0303 is constant on\nstable leaves and there is transverse absolute continuity, we get a mufk (x) -positive\nu\nmeasure set of w0 \u2208 Wloc\n(f k (x)) such that \u03c6\u0303+ (w0 ) = \u03c6\u0303+ (y). See Figure 3. But\nf k (x) \u2208 S, so due to Lemma 3.1 again \u03c6\u0303+ (y) = \u03c6\u0303+ (f k (x)) = \u03c6\u0303+ (x) concluding\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nIn order to prove Theorem 1.1, we shall need a refinement of Lemma 3.1:\nLemma 3.2. Given \u03c6 \u2208 L1 (\u03bc) there exists an invariant set S\u03c6 \u2282 M , \u03bc(S\u03c6 ) = 1\nsuch that if x \u2208 S\u03c6 then mux -a.e. y \u2208 W u (x) satisfy \u03c6+ (y) = \u03c6+ (x).\nProof. Given \u03c6 \u2208 L1 (\u03bc) take a sequence of continuous functions \u03c6n converging\n1\n+\nto \u03c6 in L1 (\u03bc). Since \u03c6\u0303+\nthere exists a subsequence\nn converges in L (\u03bc) to \u03c6\u0303\n\u03c6\u0303nk + converging a.e. to \u03c6\u0303+ . The intersection of this set of almost every where\nconvergence with the set S obtained in Lemma 3.1 gives the desired set S\u03c6 . \u0003\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SRB MEASURES\n\n9\n\nLet us give now the proof of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. To simplify ideas, let us suppose that p is a hyperbolic\nfixed point. Let S be the set obtained in Lemma 3.2 for the characteristic function\n1\u039bs (p) . Take x \u2208 \u039bu (p) \u2229 S, we will prove that x \u2208 \u039bs (p). This proves the first\nclaim of the Theorem. Let y \u2208 \u039bs (p), and \u03b5 > 0, l > 1 be such that x, y \u2208 R\u03b5,l .\nWe loose no generality in assuming that y is in the support of \u03bc restricted to\n\u039bs (p) \u2229 R\u03b5,l . We can also assume that x and y return infinitely many times\nto R\u03b5,l . Proceeding as in the proof of Corollary 1.3, we may also assume that\nd(y, W u (p)) < \u03b4/2.\nNote that 1\u039bs (p) is an f -invariant function. This implies that if x \u2208\n/ \u039bs (p) then\nu\nu\ns\nmx -a.e. y \u2208 W (x) will satisfy y \u2208\n/ \u039b (p), due to Lemma 3.2 above. The idea\nu\nof the proof is to find a mx -positive measure set of points z \u2208 W u (x) such that\nz \u2208 \u039bs (p). This will prove that x \u2208 \u039bs (p).\nAs a consequence of the Inclination Lemma, and since x returns infinitely many\ns\ntimes to R\u03b5,l , there exists k > 0 such that W u (f k (x)) t Wloc\n(y) 6= \u2205. Note that\nthis intersection a priori can have positive dimension.\n\nFigure 2. Proof of Corollary 1.3\nNow, since y is in the support of \u03bc restricted to R\u03b5,l \u2229 \u039bs (p), we have \u03bc(R\u03b5,l \u2229\n\u039b (p)\u2229B\u03b4 (y)) > 0. Since by hypothesis \u03bc is a hyperbolic measure with absolutely\ncontinuous conditional measures along unstable manifolds (SRB-measure) there\nu\nexists z \u2208 B\u03b4 (y) such that dim(W u (y)) = dim(W u (z)) and muz (Wloc\n(z) \u2229 R\u03b5,l \u2229\ns\n\u039b (p) \u2229 B\u03b4 (y)) > 0. Take a smooth foliation L of a neighborhood of a point\ns\nof Wloc\n(y) \u2229 W u (f k (x)) inside W u (f k (x)) of dimension equal to dim(W u (y)) =\nn \u2212 dim(W s (y)). This can be done in such a way that every L \u2208 L is transversal\ns\nto Wloc\n(y). In fact\ns\n\ndim(W s (y) \u2229 W u (f k (x)) = dim(W u (f k (x))) + dim(W s (y)) \u2212 n\n= dim(W u (f k (x))) \u2212 dim(W u (y)).\n\n\f10\n\nF. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, M. A. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, A. TAHZIBI, AND R. URES\n\ns\nTake an open submanifold T of W u (f k (x)) t Wloc\n(y). Transverse absolute\nL\ns\ncontinuity of the stable foliation implies that m\u03c9 (\u039b (p) \u2229 L) > 0 \u2200\u03c9 \u2208 T where\nmL is the induced Lebesgue measure of the the leaf L of the smooth foliation L.\nNow Fubini theorem for the smooth foliation L implies that\nZ\ns\nu\nk\nu\nmL\u03c9 (L\u03c9 \u2229 \u039bs (p))dmT (\u03c9) > 0\nmf k (x) (\u039b (p) \u2229 W (f (x))) \u2265\nT\n\nSo we have proved that a mufk (x) -positive measure subset of W u (f k (x)) belongs\nto \u039bs (p). As x \u2208 S and S is invariant this implies that f k (x) \u2208 \u039bs (p) and so\n\u25e6\nx \u2208 \u039bs (p). This finishes the proof of \u039bu (p) \u2282 \u039bs (p).\nBy a similar argument as above we are able to prove the ergodicity of \u03bc|\u039b(p) .\nIndeed, let \u03c6 \u2208 C(M ) and x, y \u2208 \u039b(p) be as above with S be the full measure\nobtained in lemma 3.1 for \u03c6. Following the above arguments mutatis mutandis,\nwe prove that \u03c6+ (x) = \u03c6+ (y).\nBy definition the restriction of f on \u039b(p) is non uniformly hyperbolic with the\nsame index of p.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Let x, y as in the proof of Theorem 1.1 with the difference\nthat now y is a density point of R\u03b5,l \u2229 \u039bs (p) for Lebesgue measure. Now take an\nsmooth foliation F of dimension equal to dim(W u (y)) inside B\u03b4 (y). By Fubini\ntheorem there exist a leaf of this foliation F(z), z \u2208 B\u03b4 (y) such that mF\nz (F(z) \u2229\ns\nF\nR\u03b5,l \u2229 \u039b (p) \u2229 B\u03b4 (y)) > 0 where here mz denotes the Lebesgue measure of F(z).\nFrom this point, just changing the role of W u (z) by F(z) in the proof of theorem\n1.1 the arguments are the same.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.4. Let \u03bc be a hyperbolic SRB measure. Firstly we prove the\nfollowing well-known fact.\nLemma 3.3. Almost all ergodic components of \u03bc are hyperbolic and SRB.\nProof. By ergodic decomposition there exists a probability measure \u03bc\u0302 on M(M(f ))\nwith support on ergodic measures such that\nZ\nh\u03bc =\nh\u03bd d\u03bc\u0302(\u03bd),\nM(f )\n\nZ X\n\n\u03bb+\ni d\u03bc\n\nZ X\n\n\u03bb+\ni (\u03bd)d\u03bc\u0302(\u03bd).\nRP +\nBy Ruelle inequality we have that for all \u03bd, h(\u03bd) \u2264\n\u03bbi (\u03bd) and putting\nthese together it is clear that \u03bc\u0302\u2212almost every \u03bd will satisfy the entropy formula\nand so it is an SRB measure.\n\u0003\n=\n\nFrom now on suppose that \u03bc is itself an ergodic hyperbolic SRB measure. By a\nKatok result (f, \u03bc) is approximated by uniformly hyperbolic sets with \u03bc\u2212measure\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SRB MEASURES\n\n11\n\nzero. More precisely, take a Pesin block \u0393 of large measure such that the size of\nstable and unstable manifolds are uniformly bounded from below by a constant\nlarger than zero. Let x \u2208 supp(\u03bc|\u0393) and B be a small ball around x such that\n\u03bc(B \u2229 \u0393) > 0. By Katok closing lemma we can find a periodic point p near\nenough to x whose stable and unstable manifolds respectively are C 1 \u2212close to\nthe stable and unstable manifolds of p and consequently x \u2208 \u039b(p). As the stable\nand unstable lamination vary continuously on \u0393 we obtain that y \u2208 \u039b(p) for\nany y \u2208 B \u2229 \u0393. This yields that \u03bc(\u039b(p)) > 0. The ergodicity of \u03bc implies that\n\u03bc(\u039b(p)) = 1.\n\u0003\n4. Example\nHere we give some examples of systems with SRB measures which shed light\non the difference between our results in smooth and SRB measures case.\nWe construct a diffeomorphism f : M \u2192 M with an SRB measure \u03bc such that\nthere exists a hyperbolic periodic point p such that \u03bc(\u039bs (p)) = \u03bc(\u039bu (p)) = 1/2\nbut \u03bc(\u039bs \u2229 \u039bu ) = 0. Observe that \u03bc can not be the Lebesgue measure by our\nprevious work in [19]. In the smooth measure case \u03bc(\u039bs ), \u03bc(\u039bu ) > 0 implies that\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u039bs = \u039bu = \u039b and f |\u039b is ergodic.\nWe will split the construction of f into four steps.\n4.1. First Step. We begin with f0 : T2 \u2192 T2 be a C 1+\u03b1 , 0 < \u03b1 < 1 almost\n-Anosov diffeomorphism with an SRB measure \u03bc0 . Moreover f0 has a fixed point\nR such that Df0 (R) has two eigenvalues \u03bb1 = 1, \u03bb2 < 1. Such f0 can be obtained\nsatisfying the following properties:\n\u2022 \u03bc0 -almost every x \u2208 T2 has one positive (and consequently one negative)\nLyapunov exponent,\n\u2022 W s (R) t W u (P ) for any periodic point P 6= R,\n\u2022 W u (Q) t W s (P ) for any two periodic points P, Q \u2208 T2 .\nWe emphasize that such example can not be C 2 . See the work of Hatomoto [10]\n(see also [11])\n4.2. Second Step. Now we consider a family of skew products over f0 as follows.\nRecall that \u03bc0 is an SRB measure of f0 and f0 has a fixed point R with a neutral\ndirection. We assume also that f0 has two more fixed points P, Q which are\nhyperbolic with one dimensional unstable manifold. For x \u2208 T2 and t \u2265 1 let\ngxt : S1 \u2192 S1 satisfy the following properties:\n\u2022 For all x \u2208 T2 , gxt : S1 \u2192 S1 , gxt (0) = 0, |Dgxt (0)| \u2264 t,\n\u2022 For some small \u000f > 0, |Dgxt (0)| = t, \u2200x \u2208 B\u000f (Q),\n1\nt\n\u2022 31 \u2264 |Dg\n/ B2\u000f (Q),\nR x (0)| \u2264 t 2 , \u2200x \u2208\n\u2022 t \u2192 T2 log |Dgx (0)|d\u03bc0 is continuous.\n\n\f12\n\nF. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, M. A. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, A. TAHZIBI, AND R. URES\n\nNow we consider the following skew product over f0 :\nF t (x, \u03b8) = (f0 (x), gxt (\u03b8))\nLemma 4.1. There exists t0 such that for \u03bc0 \u00d7 \u03b40 almost every (x, 0) \u2208 T2 \u00d7 S1 ,\nthe Lyapunov exponent of F t0 in the tangent direction to S1 vanishes.\nProof. Since \u03bc0 is ergodic, let \u03b1 := \u03bc0 (B\u000f (Q). By Birkhoff's Theorem for a\n\u03bc0 \u2212typical point x :\nZ\n1\nn\u22121\nlog |Dgxt (0)|d\u03bc0 = lim log |\u03a0i=0\nDgf0i (x) (0)| \u2264 log(t)\n\u03b1 log(t)\u2212(1\u2212\u03b1) log(3) \u2264\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\nT2\nR\nUsing the above estimates and the continuityR of T2 log |Dgxt (0)|d\u03bc0 with respect\nto t, we conclude that there exist t0 such that T2 log |Dgxt (0)|d\u03bc0 = 0 which means\nthat \u03bc0 \u00d7 \u03b40 -almost every point (x, \u03b8) \u2208 T2 \u00d7 S1 has zero Lyapunov exponent.\n\u0003\n4.3. Third Step. Let F := F t0 with t0 as above. Let A : T2 \u2192 T2 be a linear\nAnosov diffeomorphism and define\nf \u2208 Diff 1+\u03b1 (T2 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 T2 ), f (x, \u03b8, y) = (F (x, \u03b8), A(y)).\nThe Lebesgue measure of T2 is an SRB measure for A and we denote it by m.\nR\nSo, the probability measure \u03bc := \u03bc0 +\u03b4\n\u00d7 \u03b40 \u00d7 m is invariant by f . We will show\n2\ns\nthat \u03bc is SRB and satisfies \u03bc(\u039b (P )) = \u03bc(\u039bu (P )) = 21 and \u039bs (P ) \u2229 \u039bu (P ) = \u2205.\nThe SRB property is straightforward from the definition and the fact that the\nLyapunov exponent of f along the tangent direction to S1 vanishes and \u03bc0 and\nm are SRB.\nBy our construction P is a hyperbolic fixed point with unstable dimension\ntwo. Q is also hyperbolic but with unstable dimension three and R has a neutral\ndirection and one dimensional unstable manifold. As W s (R, f0 ) t W u (P, f0 )\nand A is Anosov, we conclude that {R} \u00d7 {0} \u00d7 T2 \u2282 \u039bs and consequently\n\u03bc(\u039bs (P ) \u2265 \u03bc({R} \u00d7 {0} \u00d7 T2 ) = 21 . In fact, as for \u03bc0 \u00d7 \u03b40 -almost every (x, \u03b8) the\nPesin stable manifold is two dimensional, no such point belongs to \u039bs (P ) and we\nhav eproved that \u03bc(\u039bs ) = 12 .\nLet us now investigate \u039bu (P ). By construction \u03bc0 \u00d7 \u03b4R \u00d7 m-almost avery point\nhas two dimensional unstable anifold which is transverse to W s (P ). It is clear that\n{R} \u00d7 {0} \u00d7 T2 \u2208\n/ \u039bu (P ). We proved that \u03bc(\u039bu (P )) = 21 and \u039bs (P ) \u2229 \u039bu (P ) = \u2205.\n5. SRB measure for surface diffeomorphisms\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1.7. For this aim we will first prove Theorem\n1.6. This will be done in the next subsection.\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SRB MEASURES\n\n13\n\n5.1. SRB measures supported on the same ergodic homoclinic class. In\nthis subsection we will show that ergodic homoclinic classes support at most one\nSRB measure. This is the statement of Theorem 1.6.\nProof of Theorem 1.6. Let B(\u03bc) and B(\u03bd) be, respectively, the basins of \u03bc and \u03bd.\nBy ergodicity we have that \u03bc(B(\u03bc)) = \u03bd(B(\u03bd)) = 1. In fact by Birkhoff's Ergodic\nTheorem there exists B\u03bc \u2282 B(\u03bc) and B\u03bd \u2282 B(\u03bd) such that \u03bc(B\u03bc ) = \u03bd(B\u03bd ) = 1\nwhere\nZ\nn\u22121\n1X\n\u00b1i\nB\u03bc = {x : lim\n\u03c6(f (x)) \u2192 \u03c6d\u03bc \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 C(M )}\nn\u2192\u221e n\ni=0\nn\u22121\n\n1X\nB\u03bd = {x : lim\n\u03c6(f \u00b1i (x)) \u2192\nn\u2192\u221e n\ni=0\n\nZ\n\u03c6d\u03bd\n\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 C(M )}\n\nSince \u03bc(\u039b) = \u03bd(\u039b) = 1 it comes out that \u03bc((B\u03bc ) \u2229 \u039b) = \u03bd((B\u03bd ) \u2229 \u039b) = 1. From\nnow on the technique will be similar to one of the proof of Corollary 1.3.\nBy absolute continuity of unstable lamination we can take x such that mux (B\u03bc \u2229\n\u039b) = 1. Now let y be a point of recurrence of B\u03bd \u2229 \u039b\u000f where \u039b\u000f is a Pesin block\nfor \u03bd|\u039b. Again by absolute continuity of unstable lamination we can choose y in\nsuch a way that muy (\u039b\u000f \u2229 B\u03bd ) > 0. Since y returns infinitely many times to the\nPesin's block we additionally can assume that y is close enough to W u (p). Using\nthe \u03bb-lemma we have that W u (f k (x)) is also C 1 \u2212close to W u (p). This implies\nthat W\u000fs (z) t W u (f k (x)), \u2200z \u2208 \u039b\u000f \u2229 B\u03bd . Now, by the absolute continuity of stable\nlamination on Pesin's blocks, mufk (x) (Hs (\u039b\u000f \u2229 B\u03bd )) > 0. On the one hand, we\nknow that the basin of \u03bd is s\u2212saturated so mufk (x) (B(\u03bd)) > 0. On the other hand\nmufk (x) (B(\u03bc)) = 1 and this implies that B\u03bc \u2229 B\u03bd 6= \u2205 which implies \u03bc = \u03bd.\n\u0003\n5.2. Uniqueness for transitive diffeomorphisms of surfaces. Let \u03bc and\n\u03bd be two ergodic SRB measures. As mentioned before \u03bc and \u03bd are hyperbolic\nmeasures. By theorem 1.4 we conclude that there exist hyperbolic periodic points\nP\u03bc , P\u03bd such that \u03bd(\u039b(P\u03bd )) = \u03bc(\u039b(P\u03bc )) = 1. The following proposition is the main\ningredient of the proof of Theorem 1.7.\nProposition 5.1. P\u03bc and P\u03bd are homoclinically related and \u039b(P\u03bc ) = \u039b(P\u03bd ).\nThe above proposition together with Theorem 1.6 immediately implies the\nconclusion of Theorem 1.7. To prove the existence of homoclinically relation\nbetween P\u03bc and P\u03bd we need that the manifold M is two dimensional. Indeed\nfirstly, using that M is a surface we prove that the invariant maniolds of P\u03bc and\nP\u03bd are topologically transverse. Then using a finer analysis of laminations and\nSard's Theorem we prove transversal homoclinical intersection.\n\n\f14\n\nF. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, M. A. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, A. TAHZIBI, AND R. URES\n\nProof. Recall that P\u03bc and P\u03bd (which we suppose that are fixed points) comes from\nKatok's closing lemma and as \u03bc, \u03bd are hyperbolic ergodic both P\u03bc and P\u03bd have non\ntrivial homoclinic classes. Consequently there exist topological rectangles whose\nboundaries (\u2202 s and \u2202 u ) are consisted of stable and unstable segments of P\u03bc , P\u03bd .\n(See figue 1.) Choose two such rectangle R\u03bc , R\u03bd such that P\u03bc , P\u03bd respectively\nbelong to the boundary of R\u03bc and R\u03bd and R\u03bc \u2229 R\u03bd = \u2205.\n\nFigure 3.\nBy topological transitivity of f there exist n \u2208 N such that f n (R\u03bc ) \u2229 R\u03bd 6= \u2205.\nObserve that f n (R\u03bc ) and R\u03bd are topological rectangles and as P\u03bd \u2208\n/ R\u03bc it comes\nout that R\u03bd is not contained in f n (R\u03bc ). So W u (P\u03bc ) \u2229 \u2202 s (R\u03bd ) 6= \u2205. Although\n\u2202 s (R\u03bd ) is a piece of W s (P\u03bd ) this intersection may be just topologically transversal\n(a tangency). However, we will prove that there should exist also transversal\nintersections between W u (P\u03bc ) and W s (P\u03bd ).\nLemma 5.2. Taking a rectangle R\u03bd small enough there exist new system of coordinates such that:\n(1) R\u03bd = [0, 1]2 ,\n(2) W u (P\u03bc ) \u2229 R\u03bd is the graph of a C 2 -function \u03b3 : I \u2192 [0, 1], I \u2282 [0, 1],\n(3) There exists K \u2282 [0, 1] of positive Lebesgue measure such (0, x) \u2208 [0, 1]2\nhas a \"large\" stable manifold crossing [0, 1]2 .\nProof. We will show that it is possible to take R\u03bd \u2282 R\u03bd in such a way that\nit satisfies items 2 and 3 after a suitable change of coordinates. Observe that\nW u (P\u03bc ) is a C 2 -curve and we have supposed that it is tangent to local stable\nmanifold of P\u03bd . So to guarantee the second item of the Lemma, it is enough to\ntake R\u03bd with small height.\nTo prove the last item, firstly notice that by construction the stable (unstable)\nmanifold of P\u03bd has transversal intersection with unstable (stable) manifold of\nthe points inside a Pesin block of \u039b(P\u03bd ). Let us denote by \u039b\u000f (P\u03bd ) such Pesin\nhyperbolic block of \u039b(P\u03bd ). By a desintegration argument and using the fact that\nthe conditional measures of \u03bc along unstable manifolds are absolutely continuous\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF SRB MEASURES\n\n15\n\nwith respect to Lebesgue measure we get a local Pesin unstable manifold which\nintersect \u039b\u000f (P\u03bd ) in a positive Lebesgue measure. Now as the stable lamination\nis absolutely continuous we slide such points along stable laminae to obtain a\npositive measure subset of W u (P\u03bd ) which we denote it by K\u0302.\nNow iterating K\u0302 and using \u03bb-lemma we obtain a positive Lebesgue measure\nsubset K \u2282 [0, 1] such that {0} \u00d7 K \u2282 \u2202(R\u03bd ) and W s (0, x) crosses R\u03bd for any\nx \u2208 K.\n\u0003\nLet \u03c6(x) := hs (x, \u03b3(x)) where hs is the projection by stable lamination (see\nFigure 4).\n\nFigure 4.\nObserve that a priori \u03c6 is defined just on a closed subset {x \u2208 I : (x, \u03b3(x)) \u2208\nW s (K)} with positive Lebesgue measure. However we can verify the Whitney\ncondition to extend it in a C 1 fashion on the whole inteval I as we explain below.\nWe recall a standard treatment of absolute continuity of stable holonomies\nin the Pesin's block following Pugh-Shub [17]. In fact we show that, as the\nstable lamination is co-dimension one its holonomy map is differentiable. More\nprecisely we claim that the stable holonomy can be extended to a C 1 function\nhs : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] and consequently \u03c6 can be extended to a C 1 -function on I.\nLet F be a C 1 \u2212foliation which is close to the stable lamination in C 1 -sense.\nGraph transforation arguments show that f \u2212n (F) converges to the stable lamination. Let (hn , Jhn ) represent the holonomy hn of f \u2212n (F) with its derivative\nJhn . As the domain of hn is one dimensional Jhn reprsents both the derivative\nand the jacobain of the holonomy hn .\n\n\f16\n\nF. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, M. A. RODRIGUEZ HERTZ, A. TAHZIBI, AND R. URES\n\nBy definition the following diagram comutes\nh\n\n0\n\n0\nf \u2212n (D) \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 f \u2212n (D )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 \u2212n\n\u2212n\nf y\nyf\n\nD\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nhn\n\nD\n\n0\n\nAll holonomies hn are diffrentiable and\nJhn (x) = Jf \u2212n (f n (hn (x))) \u25e6 Jh0 \u25e6 Jf n (x)\nIt is standard that (hn , Jhn ) converge uniformly to (h, Jh) where h is the stable\nlamination holonomy and for some function Jh. As hn are diffrentiable with\nderivative Jhn , by uniform convergence of Jhn to Jh we conclude that Jh satisfies\nthe C 1 -extension whitney theorem hypothesis and consequently we can extend \u03c6\nto a C 1 -function on the whole interval I.\nNow it is easy to see that if W s (x, \u03b3(x)) is tangent to the graph of \u03b3 then\nD\u03c6(x) = 0. By Sard's theorem the Lebesgue measure of critical values of \u03c6 is\nzero. From this we conclude that the graph of \u03b3 intersect transversally W s (0, x)\nfor some x \u2208 K.\nBy invariance there exist z \u2208 \u039b\u000f (P\u03bd ) such that W s (z) t W u (P\u03bc ) 6= \u2205. Now\nusing again Katok's closing lemma we find a hyperbolic periodic point P\u0302\u03bd with\nW s (P\u02c6\u03bd ) close enough to W s (z) in C 1 -topology so that W s (z) t W u (P\u02c6\u03bc ) 6= \u2205. It\nis clear that P\u03bd and P\u0302\u03bd are homoclinically related. So using \u03bb\u2212lemma it comes\nout that W u (P\u03bc ) has also a transversal intersection with W s (P\u03bd ). See figure 2.\nA similar argumet shows that W u (P\u03bd ) has a transversal intersection with\nW s (P\u03bc ). So we proved that P\u03bc and P\u03bd are homoclinically related. Now using\nProposition 5.1 we obtain that \u039b(P\u03bc ) = \u039b(P\u03bd ).\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] J.F. Alves, C. Bonatti, M.
