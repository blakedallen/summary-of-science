In this contribution first\nof all we review the theoretical accuracy in the computation\nof LHC benchmark processes. Then we discuss the impact\nof available and future LHC data in global analysis of parton distributions, with emphasis on the treatment of luminosity uncertainties. Finally we present some suggestions\nfor the physics opportunities that can become available by\nmeasuring ratios of cross sections between the 8 TeV and 7\nTeV runs.\n\nTHEORETICAL ACCURACY OF LHC\nSTANDARD CANDLES\nAn accurate determination of the luminosity uncertainty\nis specially important when comparing data and theory for\nthe total rates of relevant processes like top quark or electroweak boson production, for which the theoretical predictions are very accurate. For top quark pair production the\ntheoretical accuracy is NLO+NNLL. An up\u2013to\u2013date comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental\ndata for top quark pair cross sections has been presented in\nRef. [1]. The comparison of these updated predictions with\nthe most recent ATLAS and CMS data is show in Fig. 1.\nThe current accuracy in the theoretical computation of the\ncross section is about 18 pb (10%) from higher orders and\nPDF uncertainties. It is reasonable to expect that this theory error will decrease down to 3-5 pb once the full NNLO\ncalculation and more updated PDFs with LHC data become\navailable. This would allow stringent tests of new physics\nscenarios by comparing to the LHC data, provided that luminosity uncertainties can be reduced down to a similar\nlevel.\nAnother very important cross sections are the W and\nZ cross sections. In particular, the Z cross section has\nbeen used as a cross check of the calibration of the absolute luminosity. The NNLO corrections for this processes\nare know since a long time, and have recently been implemented in fully differential programs like FEWZ [2] or\nDYNNLO [3] that allow to apply exactly the same cuts as\nin the experimental analysis. In Fig. 2 we show the comparison of the recent ATLAS and CMS data on the W +\nand W \u2212 total cross sections with predictions from different PDF sets. The comparison between data and theory\nfor these observables is now limited by normalization un\u2217 This research has been supported by a Marie Curie Intra\u2013European\nFellowship of the European Community's 7th Framework Programme under contract number PIEF-GA-2010-272515.\n\u2020 juan.rojo@cern.ch\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the most updated theoretical predictions for top quark pair production with ATLAS and\nCMS data.

This source of uncertainty can be\neliminated taking suitable ratios of cross sections, like the\nW + /W \u2212 ratio, but this way useful information about the\nnormalizations of the distributions is lost.\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of the recent ATLAS and CMS data\non the W + and W \u2212 total cross sections with predictions\nfrom different PDF sets. Figure taken from [4].\nW, Z and top production are two of the best standard\ncandles at the LHC, but many other cross sections have\nbeen measured with good accuracy to begin to challenge\ntheory, and is clear that at the level of an accuracy of 510%, the luminosity uncertainties begin to play a role. In\nFig. 3 we show a recent compilation of CMS electroweak\n\n\fmeasurements compared to theory predictions. One might\nexpect that the accuracy of other processes like W W or\nZ\u03b3 to improve in the near future up to the point in which\nthey would benefit from a more accurate luminosity measurement. Eventually, even processes like W in association\nwith one jet could be measured precisely enough so that the\ncomparison with theory is limited by luminosity uncertainties.\n\n\u2022 Electroweak boson production, both inclusive and in\nassociation with jets and heavy quarks\n\u2022 Inclusive jet and dijet production\n\u2022 Isolated photon and photon+jet production\n\u2022 Top quark pair production distributions and single top\nproduction\n\u2022 Heavy flavor production\nThe kinematical coverage in the x, Q2 plane of the different\nexperiments included in the NNPDF2.1 analysis [9], supplemented with that of some recent LHC measurements, is\nshown in Fig. 4.

The luminosity uncertainty of 4% is also\nshown\nAll in all, there is a strong physics motivation to obtain\naccurate determinations of the LHC luminosity to optimize\nthe comparisons between data and theory for several standard candle processes. Now we turn to discuss the impact of normalization errors and LHC data in the context\nof global PDF analysis.\n\nIMPACT OF LHC DATA INTO PDFS\nThe precise knowledge of parton distributions functions\nis an important requirement for the LHC physics program.\nJust to mention two examples: accurate PDFs, and in particular the gluon, are crucial to determine the theoretical\nprecision of the Higgs cross section in gluon fusion [5, 6],\nand PDFs are now the dominant systematic error in the\nvery precise CDF determination of MW [7], which imposes tight constraints on SM Higgs and new physics from\nindirect EW fits. In both cases LHC data is known to improve the accuracy of the theoretical predictions from the\nPDF side (see for example [8] for the MW case.)\nPDFs are determined from a wide variety of different\ndata like deep\u2013inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan and jet production. With the advent of the LHC, the emphasis is\nmoving towards using as much as possible solid and robust LHC data. There are many processes that have been\nmeasured at the LHC that can be used as an input to global\nPDF analyses, and many others that will be measured in the\nnext years. A necessarily incomplete list is the following:\n\nFigure 4: Kinematical coverage in the x, Q2 plane of the\ndifferent experiments included in the NNPDF2.1 analyses, supplemented with that of some recent LHC measurements.\nEach of the LHC processes listed above provides a handle on different parton combinations and on different xregions. For example, the light quarks and antiquarks, including the strange PDFs, can be determined from electroweak boson production. ATLAS has presented a measurement of the 2010 data for the W + , W \u2212 and Z lepton\ndistributions with full covariance matrix [11], that can be\nused to impose tight constraints on the medium and small-x\nquarks an antiquarks. For this dataset the luminosity uncertainties are the dominant experimental error. In Fig. 5 we\nshow how the NNPDF2.1 NNLO prediction are modified\nby the inclusion of these ATLAS data, where the theoretical\nNNLO predictions have been computed with DYNNLO.\nRelated constraints are provided by the CMS and LHCb W\nasymmetry measurements [12], as well by off\u2013shell Drell\u2013\nYan collider data.\nAnother interesting process is the associated production\nof a charm quark together with a W boson: this process provides a unique direct handle on the strange quark\nPDF [13], which is the worse known of all light quark\n\n\fFigure 5: The ATLAS data on the W + lepton distribution\nfrom the 2010 data, compared to the NNPDF2.1 NNLO\nPDFs before and after including the data into the fit.\n\ndijets with the 2010 datasets, however only ATLAS provides the full covariance matrix of the measurement. Preliminary results for the CMS inclusive jets and dijets from\nthe 2011 data, which span a much wider kinematical range,\nare also available.\nAnother process directly sensitive to the gluon PDF at\nleading order is direct photon production. Indeed, prompt\nphoton data was also used until the 90s to constrain the\ngluon in PDF fits, but a discrepancy with some fixed target\nexperiments lead to abandon it. A recent reanalysis shows\na remarkable agreement between NLO QCD and collider\nisolated photon data from all scales from 200 GeV up to 7\nTeV [19], finding also that the LHC isolated photon data\nis accurate enough to provide moderate constraints in the\ngluon PDF at intermediate values of x, see Fig. 7, and in\nthe associated Higgs cross sections in gluon fusion.\n\nPDFs. In Fig. 6 we show preliminary results of a study of\nthe impact of W + c LHC pseudo-data into the NNPDF2.1\nNNLO collider only PDFs: is clear that the W + c process\nwill allow a direct determination of the strangeness content\nof the proton without the need to resort to low energy neutrino DIS data, which are less reliable because of large theoretical corrections, ambiguities of the heavy quark treatment and nuclear corrections. The inclusive W and Z data\nshould also provide constraints on the strange sea. A recent\nATLAS analysis [14] suggest that their inclusive measurements are accurate enough to pin down strangeness with\ngood precision, although the analysis is based on a restrictive parametrization of the input strange PDF.\nFigure 7: The impact of the recent isolated photon data\nfrom the LHC on the NNPDF2.1 gluon.\n\nFigure 6: The strangeness distribution at a typical LHC\nscale from the NNPDF2.1 NNLO collider only fit (without\nLHC data) supplemented by W + c pseudodata.\nOther measurements from the LHC are sensitive to the\ngluon PDF. Inclusive jets are known to provide an important handle to constrain the large-x gluon. For example,\nthe D0 and CDF Tevatron Run II measurements are necessary to stabilize the gluon PDF (as well as the strong coupling [15]) in the region relevant for Higgs boson production via gluon fusion at the LHC [16]. ATLAS [17] and\nCMS [18] have presented their results for inclusive jets and\n\nA careful and consistent treatment of normalization uncertainties between datasets is crucial in the context of a\nglobal PDF analysis. Ref. [20] reviews the different statistical approaches currently used to include multiplicative\nnormalization errors into recent PDF analysis. As an illustration, is clear that it is important to consistently take common normalizations between different datasets: two 2010\nATLAS measurements like inclusive jets and W/Z production, both available with the full covariance matrix, have a\ncommon single normalization uncertainty coming from the\nluminosity calibration, and this is important for a more accurate PDF analysis. A similar point was emphasized in\nRef. [16], where it is argued that the consistent treatment\nof the normalizations of the Tevatron inclusive jet data and\nZ rapidity distributions was very important, since the latter\nfixed the normalization shift and improved the constraints\non the PDFs coming from the former.\nIn general, to optimize experimental data combination in\na global theoretical analysis, we need to quantify as accurately as possible the possible information:\n\u2022 The correlation of the systematic errors, including luminosity, between two datasets in the same experi-\n\n\fment, say W, Z and jet production from ATLAS.\n\u2022 The correlation of the systematic errors, including luminosity, between two datasets of different experiments, say W, Z from ATLAS and CMS.\n\u2022 The correlation of the systematic errors, including luminosity, between two datasets of the same experiment from two different runs, say CMS W, Z between\nthe 2012 and 2011 data.\nOf course, this is a very optimistic program \u2013 but even if\nit can be achieved only in a limited way, it will be very\nbeneficial for the LHC precision physics studies. Moreover any eventual combination of LHC data will require\nto understand this cross-correlations between different experiments, just as understanding the correlations between\nthe H1 and ZEUS data lead to the very precise combined\nHERA\u2013I dataset [21].\n\nFigure 8: Comparison of the gluon-gluon partonic luminosity for some recent NNLO PDF sets as a function of the\ninvariant mass of the produced final state. Note that PDF\nuncertainties blow up for very large invariant masses. Figure taken from [4].\n\nCROSS SECTION RATIOS AT 8 TEV\nThe 8 TeV 2012 LHC run offers a wide new range of\nphysics possibilities that go beyond the expanded center of\nmass energy. One interesting study would be to measure\nratios of cross sections between the 2012 and 2011 data.\nSuch ratios of cross sections are important because they\ncan be measured very precisely thanks to a strong cancellation of systematic uncertainties and partly of normalization\nuncertainties as well. Thus in principle one can expect to\nobtain useful information by selecting suitable observables.\nOne example is provided by the fact that one can measure ratios of cross sections between 8 and 7 TeV to constrain the large-x PDFs. Indeed, large\u2013x PDFs are poorly\nconstrained by available data: as can be seen Fig. 8, the\ngluon-gluon parton luminosity when the invariant mass of\nthe produced final state is large has very substantial uncertainties. This in turn affects the sensitivity for searches and\neventual characterization of new physics produced close to\nthreshold, like heavy supersymmetric particles or new resonances.\nHowever, it can be seen that large-x PDFs can be studied by measuring ratios of cross sections at high final state\ninvariant masses. Indeed, if one can take the ratio of PDF\nluminosities between 8 TeV and 7 TeV, for example, the\ngluon-gluon luminosity defined as\nR1\n\ndx1\nx1 g x1 , MX g \u03c48 /x1 , MX\ndx1\n2 ) g (\u03c4 /x , M 2 )\ng (x1 , MX\n7\n1\nX\n\u03c47 x 1\n\nRgg \u2261 R\u03c418\n\n\u0001\n2\n\n\u0001\n2\n,\n\n(1)\n\n\u221a\n2\nwhere \u03c47 = MX\n/s7 , s7 = 7 TeV and likewise for 8\nTeV. Then one can see that producing a final state partonic\nsystem with invariant mass MX probes the very large\u2013x\nPDFs for large MX . In Fig. 9 we have computed the PDF\nuncertainty in the ratio of parton luminosities between 8\nTeV and 7 TeV, Eq. 1 obtained with the NNPDF2.1 NNLO\nPDFs [22] for different partonic subchannels. Is clear that\nas soon as the mass of the final state object raises above\n\n1 TeV, the PDF uncertainties on the ratio of luminosities\ngrows up very fast, up to larger than 100 %. Thus any measurement at this scales would provide a major constraint on\nlarge\u2013x PDFs.\n\nFigure 9: Percentage PDF uncertainty in the ratio of parton luminosities between 8 TeV and 7 TeV, Eq. 1, for the\ngg, gq and qq partonic subchannels, computed with the\nNNPDF2.1 NNLO set.\nAs an illustration of the physics potential of such cross\nsection ratios measurements, we show in Fig. 10 the ratio of production cross sections between 8 and 7 TeV of\na new heavy quark with mass mQ at the TeV scale. The\nband represents the PDF uncertainties only. The cross section has been computed with the HATHOR code [23] and\nthe NNPDF2.1 NNLO PDFs. While PDF uncertainties\nin the cross section ratio are small below mQ = 1 TeV,\nabove they increase significantly until they blow up: this\nis so because of the cancellation of parton luminosities in\nEq. 1 fails when the approach the kinematical production\nthreshold. Therefore, a measurement of a generic cross section ratio with similar gluon initiated kinematics (like dijet\n\n\fproduction) would provide stringent constraints on large-x\nPDFs even if the experimental uncertainties are only moderate.\nNNPDF2.1 NNLO + HATHOR\n10\n9\n\nPreliminary\n\nmtt(8 TeV) / mtt(7 TeV)\n\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n1.4\nmQ ( TeV )\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\nFigure 10: The ratio of production cross sections between 8\nand 7 TeV of a new heavy quark boson with mass mQ at the\nTeV scale.

One of the outcomes\nof this workshop was that quantifying the correlations of\nthe luminosity uncertainty between the 2010 and 2011 data\nwas difficult and that probably they were mostly uncorrelated, however, even if the correlation is small it will anyway be useful to quantify it.\nTo conclude, let us mention that it was suggested during the workshop to determine the relative luminosity between ATLAS and CMS by measuring the same process,\nsay the Z cross section, within the same fiducial volume.\nThis is a process for which the dominant error is by far\nthe normalization uncertainty. Therefore, it would allow\na determination with high accuracy of the relative luminosity difference between the two experiments, something\nwhich would be an important input to subsequent theoretical analysis that combine the information from the ATLAS\nand CMS data. These kind of studies are very relevant for\nthe LHC precision program, and we expect that this particular one and related analysis are carried out in the near\nfuture.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nThis is just a particular example of how to use cross section ratios to perform interesting physics studies, and that\ncan be easily generalized to many other processes like electroweak production in association with jets, photon or dijet\nproduction. It is anyway clear that ratios of cross sections\nand distributions between 8 and 7 TeV data have a very\ninteresting physics potential for PDFs, that should be explored systematically. Many other topics not necessarily\nrelated to PDFs can also be investigated, using the reduced\nexperimental uncertainties of ratios of cross sections between different collider energies.\nOf course, the effectiveness of cross section ratios data\nheavily relies on the possibility to cancel systematic and luminosity uncertainties in these ratios. The extent to which\nis possible still needs to be investigated.\n\n[1] M. Cacciari, M. Czakon, M. L. Mangano, A. Mitov and\nP. Nason, arXiv:1111.5869 [hep-ph].\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\n[8] G.
