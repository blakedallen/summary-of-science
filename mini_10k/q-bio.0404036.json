This robustness may render the\nobserved behavior insensitive to the quantitative details of the microscopic\ninteractions. Hence modeling of such networks was successful even for rather\ncrude approximations of the details. Other findings on artificial gene circuits\nshowed a broad variety of different functions despite the same topology, suggesting that quantitative details become important for some topologies [6].\nMoreover, the construction of a mathematical model and the corresponding\nabstraction of the complex intracellular network are always confronted with\nthe problem of neglecting \"unnecessary\" details. The issue of the appropriate\nlevel of abstraction has been disputed particularly in the case of metabolic\nnetworks. Therein it has been suggested that modeling efforts risk to be no\nlonger taken serious by experimentalists if modeling is continued by means of\n\"too\" strong abstractions or falsified toy models [7].\nHere we compare predictions from two models of different levels of abstraction\nto characterize the consequences of neglecting details. For this fundamental\nstudy we choose the metabolic network of glycolysis (Fig. 1) in baker's yeast\n(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) which is of particular interest to biotechnology [8,9]\nand models of different degree of complexity have been suggested and used\n[10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. We choose two models that translate the metabolic network into systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), a procedure that\nis well established [17,18,19]. Our subsequent analysis treats the ODEs fully\nnonlinear and focuses on the temporally asymptotic, self-organising behavior of the models. The distinction between steady and oscillatory states in\nthe models appears to be crucial, since several physiological advantages of\nthe latter have been proposed. The dependences of the concentrations and\nfluxes on external control parameters are numerically computed via a bifurcation analysis [20,21]. This approach enables detailed studies of large parameter\nspaces that would be more time consuming by simulation of the complete time\ncourses including transient dynamics [22]. This issue will gain importance as\nthe analysed theoretical models increase in size and complexity.\nIn order to test the predictive power of both models, we perturb both models by the same set of simple equations that account for the conversion of a\nxenobiotic (here we choose a ketone) by a single enzyme (here alcohol dehydrogenase) into a chiral carbinol which consumes the cofactor nicotinamide\nadenine dinucleotide (NADH), see Fig. 1(a). This particular perturbation was\nchosen both for its pharmaceutical relevance and its broad impact on the back2\n\n\f(a)\nGlc x0\n\nketone x\n\nglucose x\n\nketone\n\nglycolysis\n\ncarbinol\n\nNADH\n\nstorage\n\nADH\nNAD\n\nglycerol\n\n+\n\nNADH\n\nNAD\n\n+\nacetaldehyde\n\nethanol\n\ncytosol\nmedium\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\nA\nA\nN\n\nN\nN\n\nN\n\nA\n\nA\nA\n\nA\n\nFig. 1.

The pharmaceutical interest stems from the increasing demand\nfor stereoisomerically pure pharmacologically active compounds (PACs). The\nstereo-geometry of PACs essentially determines the physiological effects of a\nchiral drug, as the thalidomide (contergan R ) tragic showed in the 1950s [23].\nStereoisomerically pure carbinols are central precursors of modern, innovative\npharmaceuticals and make for more than 50% of all essential substructures\nin pharmaceuticals [9]. Today stereo-selective carbinol synthesis by means of\nbiotransformation, i.e. chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes in vivo, is\nindispensable for the production of PACs [24,25,26]. Further progress in the\nunderstanding and rational manipulation of biotransformatory carbinol syntheses strongly depends on mathematical models that account for the limiting\nreproduction of the cofactor (NADH in the considered case) and the underlying regulatory networks [27,28]. The models studied in this paper also constitute a first step in this direction. In the future we will extend the analysis to\n3\n\n\fother eucaryote's metabolic responses to a range of pharmacologically active\ncompounds.\nWe emphasize the exposure of systems in oscillatory states to xenobiotics as\na sensitive experimental probe of the network's global response. The global\nresponse is experimentally accessible via NADH-fluorescence, and oscillatory\nor steady behavior is easily distinguishable as individual cells synchronize their\noscillations [11]. The temporal frequency of the oscillations can be measured\nwith high accuracy.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 two models of glycolysis and\nthe unique set of equations representing the perturbation are introduced and\nthe employed numerical method of bifurcation analysis is outlined. Section 3\npresents our results which are discussed in Sec. 4.\n\n2\n\nModels and Methods\n\nThe glycolytic pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermenting glucose to\nethanol is one of the best studied metabolisms from both the experimental\nand modeling side [10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. We consider two different mathematical models in terms of ODEs that identically represent the topology of\nthe glycolytic pathway under anaerobic conditions, see Fig. 1(b),(c).\n\n2.1 Glycolysis\nSpecifically we start from the full scale model of glycolysis devised by Hynne\net al. [15] and compare its predictions with those of a core model with the\nsame topology adapted from Wolf et al. [12]. Public domain \"Silicon Cell\"\nversions of the models can be found at http://www.jjj.bio.vu.nl, including a graphical overview and the mathematical expressions. The full scale\nmodel contains 22 variables for concentrations of involved metabolites and\nquantitatively accounts for most known details on enzyme regulation in order\nto precisely describe the supercritical onset of oscillations as observed experimentally [11,15]. The core model has been derived from the original 9 variable\nmodel [12] by addition of the variable S1ex (extracellular glucose) and the corresponding flux balance of the medium j0ex = yvol k([Glcx ]0 \u2212 S1ex ) and a simple\nform of glucose transporter saturation j0 = k0 (S1ex \u2212 S1 )/(S1ex \u2212 S1 + Ktrans ) as\nwell as lactonitrile formation j7CN = yvol kCN S4ex in the presence of cyanide. A\nstorage flux jStore = kStore S1 A3 is included in analogy with the full scale model\nbut as a consequence of combining the three reactions downstream of glucose,\njStore is fed by intracellular glucose S1 in the core model instead of glucose-64\n\n\fparameter\nyvol * k (min\u22121 )\nk1 (mM\u22121 min\u22121 )\nk2 (mM\u22121 min\u22121 )\nk3 (mM\u22121 min\u22121 )\nk5 (min\u22121 )\nk6 (mM\u22121 min\u22121 )\n\u03ba (min\u22121 )\nq\nKI (mM)\nNtotal (mM)\nAtotal (mM)\nk0 (mM min\u22121 )\nKtrans (mM)\nkStore (mM\u22121 min\u22121 )\nkCN (min\u22121 )\nADHtotal (mM)\nk1ADH (mM\u22122 min\u22121 )\nk2ADH (min\u22121 )\nk3ADH (min\u22121 )\n\nvalue in present model\n\nvalue in model of Ref.

The consumption of two subsequent entities\nATP per glucose for storage would contribute with \u22122jStore = \u22122kStore S1 A3\nto the ATP balance. However, we find that this term overestimates the feedback of a varying glucose concentration on the ATP balance and we always\nobserved subcritical onsets of oscillations under this assumption. Indeed, not\nintracellular glucose but glucose-6-phosphate is the substrate and allosteric activator of the pathway to carbohydrate storage [29]. In the ATP balance, we\ntherefore keep the ATP consumption for storage included in the term \u2212k5 A3\nof unspecific ATP consumption in line with the original 9 variable model [12].\nThe remaining nomenclature and kinetic terms are identical with Ref. [12] but\nwe have fitted a new set of parameters (see Table 1) to describe the same data\nas the full scale model.\nIn both models, we have replaced the reduction of acetaldehyde (ACA) to\nethanol (EtOH) by the same simple reaction scheme:\nk1ADH\n\u21c0\n\u21bd\nADH\nk2\n\nACA + NADH + ADH\n\nADHACA\n\nk3ADH\n\u2192\n\nADH + NAD+ + EtOH\n\n5\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhich later enables the coupling with a second reaction that utilizes the same\nenzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; EC 1.1.1.1). We introduce the concentration [ADHACA ] of the bound enzyme as an additional variable with the\nODE\nd[ADHACA ]\n+\n\u2212\n= vADH,ACA\n\u2212 vADH,ACA\n.\ndt\n\n(2)\n\n+\n\u2212\nIts gain (vADH,ACA\n) and loss (vADH,ACA\n) fluxes are described by simple mass\naction kinetics in agreement with the Michaelis-Menten term used for the\ncomplete reaction in the original full scale model [15].\n\n+\nvADH,ACA\n= k1ADH * [ACA] * [NADH] * [ADH]\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212\nvADH,ACA\n= k2ADH * [ADHACA ] + k3ADH * [ADHACA ]\n\n(4)\n\nThe unbound form of the enzyme is computed from the total amount ADHtotal\nof the enzyme by\n[ADH] = ADHtotal \u2212 [ADHACA ]\n\n(5)\n\nwhereas the concentration of NAD+ follows from\n[NAD+ ] = Ntotal \u2212 [NADH] \u2212 [ADHACA ] .\n\n(6)\n\nThe ODEs for [NADH], [ACA] and [EtOH] have also been updated by the\nnew expressions for the fluxes. We have fixed two of the four new parameters\nto ADHtotal = 10\u03bcM and k2ADH = 1000 min\u22121 and computed the remaining\ntwo self-consistently from the fluxes in the original full scale model [15], for all\nvalues see Table 1. This procedure preserved the full scale model's behavior\nas verified in Table 2 and by comparison of the bifurcation diagrams Fig.2 (a)\nand Fig. 5 in Ref. [15]. Identical equations (2)-(6) and the same parameter\nvalues are used in both models.\nAlthough the core model possesses the same topology as the full scale model, it\nuses simple mass action kinetics for all lumped steps of the pathway [12]. One\nsingle regulatory interaction has been included, specifically the regulation of\n6-phosphofructokinase (PFK; EC 2.7.1.11) via ATP. This strong abstraction\nof the core model is sufficient to reproduce glycolytic oscillations [12].\nWe calculated a new set of parameters (see Table 1) for the core model such\nthat the onset of oscillations at [Glcx ]0 =18.5 mM is captured to the same accuracy (see Table 2) as in the full scale model, which had particularly been\noptimized to describe the onset of oscillations. To fit the core model, we inserted the known values of fluxes and concentrations from the full scale model\n6\n\n\fVariable in core\n\nand full scale model\n\nCore model\n\nFull scale model\n\nReference\n\n[Glcx ]0\nS1ex\nS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\nS4ex\nN2\nA3\n\n[Glcx ]0\n[Glcx ]\n[Glc]\n[DHAP]\n[BPG]\n[ACA]\n[ACAx ]\n[NADH]\n[ATP]\n\n18.5\n1.54982\n0.560999\n2.08167\n0.000266672\n1.48032\n1.28731\n0.330046\n2.08505\n\n18.501\n1.55409\n0.573935\n2.97161\n0.00026973\n1.49748\n1.30226\n0.329872\n2.09875\n\n18.5\n1.55307\n0.573074\n2.95\n0.00027\n1.48153\n1.28836\n0.33\n2.1\n\njin\njstorage\njGlyc\njEtOH\njoutACA\n\njin\njstorage\njGlyc\njEtOH\njoutACA\n\n48.0\n20.0\n4.77\n46.46\n4.77\n\n47.99\n19.90\n4.82\n46.54\n4.82\n\n48.0\n20.0\n4.8\n46.4\n4.8\n\nTable 2\nComparison of metabolite concentrations (top, all values are in mM and accurate\nto six significant digits) and fluxes (bottom, rounded and in mM min\u22121 ) for both\nmodels at the onset of oscillations. Reference values are taken from a comprehensive\nmodeling effort that incorporated available experimental data (Table 6 in [15]) and\nonly a subset of the full scale model's variables are shown. All others match the\nReference equally well.\n\n(Table 6 in Ref. [15], here included as Reference in Table 2) into the expressions of the core model and calculated those parameters ki which are factors\nof mass action terms. This strategy was partly used in Ref. [15]. Parameters\nki of flux terms that involve a yet undetermined saturation constant were\nexpressed as functions (with inserted values of fluxes and concentrations at\nonset) of the respective saturation constant. Then a steady state at the onset\nof oscillations (Hopf bifurcation) was determined for an initial choice of the\nunknown parameters and numerically continued along curves in the space of\nunknown parameters (see Methods below). Note, this strategy is very efficient\nsince each run explores two unknown parameters simultaneously which are\nlinked by the constraint of reproducing a Hopf bifurcation. We monitored the\nvalues of the resulting fluxes and fixed that combination of remaining parameters with closest correspondence of the computed fluxes to the data from the\nfull scale model (Tables 7,8 in Ref. [15]). The computed concentrations at the\nonset of oscillations in the core model were also in good agreement with those\nof the full scale model (see Table 2). The temporal period of the oscillations\nnear onset was close to 0.65 min in the full scale model and 0.25 min in the\ncore model.\nFig. 2 shows that the new set of parameters also yields a supercritical onset of\nthe oscillations in the core model in agreement with the full scale model and\nexperiments [11,15]. This set of parameters is therefore well suited for further\nstudies of synchronisation phenomena in a multicellular context [13].

This agreement of both models'\npredictions may stem from their identical topology but still is remarkable since\nit covers a parameter range outside of that where the models had been fitted.\nAltogether, both the full scale model and the core model show very similar\nbehavior and create the impression that quantitative details are largely irrelevant when the model is analysed in the same context that had already been\nused to determine the remaining unknown parameters. Hence \"predictions\"\nfrom a simplified model are reliable for conditions similar to those considered\nin the model's construction, e.g. both models predict a second oscillatory domain for low glucose supply. However, we want to test the reliability of the\ncore model under conditions that may be very different from those included\nduring parameter optimization. Such reliability is essential for the rational\nimprovement of biotechnological processes beyond the conditions applied so\nfar.\n2.2 Perturbation of the redox-balance\nBoth the full scale model and the core model have been augmented with\nthe same set of equations that account for the biotransformation of a xenobiotic ketone. In the considered case the ketone ethyl acetoacetate is reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; EC 1.1.1.1) to enantiomerically pure\nethyl L-3-hydroxybutyrate (carbinol). Although this reaction has been studied extensively, little is known about how the intracellular enzymes interact [30,31,32,33,34,35]. Currently, two enzymes, D-directing \u03b2-ketoacyl reductase (KAR; EC 1.1.1.100) and L-directing ADH are known to be involved in\nthe asymmetric reduction of the substrate [28,36]. Yet, KAR activity is negli8\n\n\fgible with a large excess of sugar present. Hence, the overall stereo-selectivity\nof the bioconversion largely depends on cell physiology [28].\nIn analogy to the reduction of acetaldehyde (ACA) in reaction (1), we now\nconsider the reduction of ketone (K) to carbinol (C) by the same simple reaction scheme:\nk4ADH\n\u21c0\n\u21bd\nADH\nk5\n\nK + NADH + ADH\n\nADHK\n\nk6ADH\n\u2192\n\n(7)\n\nADH + NAD+ + C\n\nwith rate constants k4ADH , k5ADH and k6ADH . If not stated differently then the\nnew parameters are chosen equal to the corresponding values of the acetaldehyde reduction, i.e. k4ADH = k1ADH , k5ADH = k2ADH and k6ADH = k3ADH . The\n+\n\u2212\ncorresponding ODE with gain (vADH,K\n) and loss (vADH,K\n) fluxes reads\n\nd[ADHK ]\n+\n\u2212\n= vADH,K\n\u2212 vADH,K\ndt\n+\nvADH,K\n= k4ADH * [K] * [NADH] * [ADH]\n\u2212\nvADH,K\n= k5ADH * [ADHK ] + k6ADH * [ADHK ] .\n\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n\nThe additional variable [ADHK ] also alters the constraints and yields via the\nconsumption of [NADH] a strong feedback on the upstream steps of glycolysis.\n\n[ADH] = ADHtotal \u2212 [ADHACA ] \u2212 [ADHK ]\n[NAD+ ] = Ntotal \u2212 [NADH] \u2212 [ADHACA ] \u2212 [ADHK ]\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nThe membrane transporters for ketone vK = \u03ba * ([Kx ] \u2212 [K]) and carbinol\nwere chosen linear in order not to restrict the accessible range of intracellular\nperturbations. The permeability for ketone \u03ba = 24.7 min\u22121 was set equal to\nthe value for acetaldehyde [15].\nThe above perturbation introduces a competition between acetaldehyde and\nketone for unbound enzyme ADH and the cofactor NADH. In Sect. 3, the\nbehavior of both models is tested for consequences of the perturbation and\npredictions on oscillatory or steady behavior are compared.\n9\n\n\f2.3 Methods\n\nThe investigated metabolic network may be considered as a nonlinear dynamical system that evolves its own state, i.e. the set of values for the metabolites'\nconcentrations, in a self-organizing manner. Various computational methods\nhave been developed and proven to be essential for the analysis of complex\ncellular networks [18,19], e.g. bifurcation analysis [20,21] and direct numerical\nsimulation [22].\nSince we focus on steady and oscillatory states it is most convenient to combine\nthe computation of the system's state along \"branches\" in order to efficiently\nscan the parameter space. This strategy is called \"continuation\" and starts\nfrom a single known solution and proceeds in subsequent steps to compute\nsimilar solutions for neighboring values of the parameters, e.g. [Glcx ]0 (mixed\nflow glucose concentration at inlet), [Kx ] (extracellular ketone concentration).\nWe used the software package AUTO for such tasks [37]. Therein the solutions\nare represented as the root of an extended system of algebraic equations derived by discretizing the ODEs. Any new solution (the root) is then computed\niteratively by the Newton algorithm.\nThe software also monitors the linear stability of the solutions and thereby\ndetects critical values of the parameters where the solutions change drastically,\nso called \"bifurcations\". The onset of oscillations, a Hopf bifurcation, is of\nspecial interest here hence the employed strategy amounts to a bifurcation\nanalysis. Bifurcations may themselves be continued in two control parameters\nsimultaneously which was used to fit the parameter set of the core model to\nflux and concentration data of the full scale model at the Hopf bifurcation. We\nhave supplemented the AUTO package by subroutines for oscillatory states\nthat monitor and export the time averages of fluxes and the relative phase\nshifts between periodic time courses of concentrations.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\n3.1 Comparison of model predictions\n\nThe fluxes within the metabolic network of glycolysis are redirected when\nthe extracellular ketone concentration is increased. Both models show almost\nidentical behavior, see Fig. 3. The effluxes (storage, ethanol, glycerol, acetaldehyde) are represented by the intervals between the curves above and below the\ncorresponding area and all effluxes add up to the total influx in units of C3 .

All fluxes have\nbeen measured in equivalents of C3 entities and have been normalized by the influx (96.2 mMC3 min\u22121 ). Individual pathways (storage, ethanol production, glycerol\nproduction, acetaldehyde (ACA) efflux as annotated) consume a portion of the influx given by the distance between the curves above and below the respective area.\n(c),(d) The biotransformation flux for both models.\n\nconsumption of cofactor NADH via ketone reduction. The latter is fostered by\nincreasing ketone concentration, and the stoichiometric constraint on NADH\nrecycling (light shaded area equals sum of dark shaded areas) demands an\nequal flux of NADH regeneration. Glycerol secretion is discriminated by the\nlack of NADH, however, in the full scale model a small flux to glycerol remains\neven for large ketone concentration whereas this flux is strongly suppressed in\nthe core model. We observed the same behavior independently of the value of\n[Glcx ]0 . Fluxes have been averaged over time for the oscillatory states. Note,\nthe time courses of substrates and cofactors in oscillatory states are generally\nout of phase which influences the average fluxes, see Subsec. 3.2.\nThe dependence of the oscillations on the strength of the ketone reduction\nis shown in Fig. 4. Both models behave differently with sustained oscillations\npredicted by the full scale model over the whole range of perturbations whereas\nthe core model does favor steady behavior. However, the temporally averaged\nconcentration of NADH shows the same depression upon ketone increase, reflecting the additional NADH consumption.\nWe repeated the analysis for several values of the carbinol release rate k6ADH\nfrom the ADH complex, see Eq. (7).

The critical rate k6cr\nrate is chosen slower than k6cr\n+\ntition of additional NAD recycling flux due to additional substrate (ketone)\nversus diminished NAD+ recycling via ACA reduction when the enzyme is\ntrapped longer in the ADHK complex and therefore less active. The former\neffect accelerates the oscillations whereas the latter slows them down. Sustained oscillations have been observed over long time scales [11] which enable\naccurate measurements of the oscillation period. Such measurements can be\nused to infer rate constants of different ketones relative to the rates of ACA\nreduction and to distinguish different ketones.\n12\n\n\f1\n(b)\n\n0.1\n\n[Kx] in mM\n\n[Kx] in mM\n\n(a)\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n25\n[Glcx]0 in mM\n\n30\n\n35 0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n15\n25\n[Glcx]0 in mM\n\n30\n\n35\n\nFig. 5. Phase diagram of stable stationary (white) and oscillatory (gray) states in\nthe [Glcx ]0 - [Kx ] parameter space (linear-logarithmic scales) for (a) the full scale\nmodel and (b) the core model.\n\nFig. 4 (d) confirms that the core model does not possess the dynamical features discussed above. In order to characterize the conflicting predictions of\nboth models, we have computed the parameter values of the onset of oscillations in a two-parameter plane, see Fig. 5. We observe a qualitative difference\nin terms of the relations between the three Hopf bifurcations that are present\nin the unperturbed system. The full scale model possesses extended oscillatory domains (gray shaded). When [Kx ] is increased, two Hopf bifurcations\nat large [Glcx ]0 are connected and the enclosed steady behavior vanishes. The\ncore model favors stationary states: two Hopf bifurcations at small [Glcx ]0 are\nconnected and the enclosed oscillations vanish when [Kx ] is increased. Hence,\nthe different levels of abstraction mainly determine the dynamical aspects of\nthe models' behavior. On the other hand the averaged or stationary quantities\nare much less affected by the considered abstraction.\nWe further examined the case of low membrane permeability for ketone or\nequivalently low external concentration of ketone (to maintain viability) which\nboth yield small intracellular concentrations of ketone. At a fixed ketone concentration ([Kx ] < 1 mM), we varied [Glcx ]0 and monitored the fluxes. A\nmaximum of carbinol production is found at an intermediate value of [Glcx ]0\nwhich depends on the fixed value [Kx ] (not shown). Both models predict this\nmaximum which can be interpreted as follows. The lack of NADH recycling is\nlimiting the carbinol flux for small [Glcx ]0 whereas at large [Glcx ]0 almost all\nADH binds to acetaldehyde which is then much more abundant than the competing ketone. Hence at intermediate value an optimum carbinol flux develops\nwhere both limiting influences are weak. In biotechnological applications it is\noften desired to adjust the glucose supply accordingly.\n13\n\n\f3.2 Phase shift in oscillatory states\n\nFinally, we have closer analysed possible differences between temporally averaged oscillatory fluxes and the coexisting steady state fluxes, both in the\nfull scale model. Note, the steady states are unstable when oscillations occur\nsupercritically but unstable states can nevertheless be computed by the continuation algorithm as this method does not rely on temporal integration. The\nunstable steady state represents a solution that equally respects stoichiometric and regulatory constraints as the stable oscillatory state does and a minor\nchange in parameters can render the steady state stable. Hence the coexisting\nunstable steady state reproduces the behavior of an alternative operational\nmode.\nAs an example, we compare the fluxes towards glycerol production for a range\nof values of the carbinol release rate k6ADH from the ADH complex, see the\nremarks above and Eq. (7). Fig. 6 (a) shows a small portion of the reaction\nscheme of glycolysis where dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and NADH\nare reaction partners. The concentrations of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP),\nglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and DHAP perform synchronized oscillations whereas the cofactors NADH and NAD+ always possess anti-cyclic\noscillations. Therefore, this branch point of glycolysis (Fig. 6 (a) and shaded\narea in Fig. 1 (b)) may act as a switch if the oscillation of either NADH or\nNAD+ can be synchronized with the substrate pool.\nThe computations are performed in the full scale model and all parameters\nof the glycerol path are kept fixed. Fig. 6 (b) shows the averaged oscillatory\nglycerol flux that is increased by more than 50% at large rate k6ADH with\nrespect to the steady state at the same rate. The time courses of substrate\nDHAP and cofactor NADH are depicted in Fig. 6 (c,d) for two different values\nof k6ADH . The temporally averaged concentrations hcit are almost identical\nwith the steady state value at the same k6ADH . We define a phase \u03c6(c) \u2261\n2\u03c0(t(cmax ) + t(cmin ))/2T to characterize a time course with period T and\ntime of maximum (t(cmax )) and minimum concentration (t(cmin )). The large\nincrease in averaged oscillatory flux versus the steady state value stems from\nthe oscillations of DHAP and NADH that are almost in phase at large k6ADH\n(Fig. 6 (d,e)).\nSlower release of NAD+ (smaller k6ADH ) increases the phase shift (\u2206\u03c6 \u2261\n\u03c6([DHAP]) \u2212 \u03c6([NADH])) to the trailing DHAP oscillation (Fig. 6 (c)) and\ndecreases the averaged oscillatory flux relative to the steady state flux (Fig. 6\n(e)). In addition to the phase shift \u2206\u03c6, the averaged oscillatory flux is also\naffected by changes (due to varied k6ADH ) in amplitude and functional form of\nthe oscillations. Moreover, the absolute values of both steady and averaged oscillatory flux vary strongly (Fig. 6 (b)) as the temporally averaged metabolite\n14\n\n\fGAP\n\nNADH\nDHAP\n\nglycerol flux in mM/min\n\nFBP\n\n(a)\n\n+\n\nNAD\n\nGlyc\n\n+\n\nNAD\n\nNADH\n\n0.5\n\nrel. glycerol flux, phase shift\n\nconcentration c - <c>t in mM\n\nBPG\n\n(c)\n\n0\n0.5 (d)\n\nc=[NADH]*10\nc=[DHAP]\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\nphase \u03c6\n\n2\u03c0\n\n(b)\n\nsteady state\n\n10\n\noscillations\n\n5\n\n0\n(e)\n\nphase shift\nrelative flux\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n2000\nk6\n\nADH\n\n4000 -1\nin min\n\n6000\n\nFig. 6.

(b) Temporally averaged glycerol flux vosc in oscillatory state (thick curve\nbetween two Hopf bifurcations at k6ADH \u2248 2250 min\u22121 and 4750 min\u22121 ) is found to\nbe larger or smaller, respectively, than the corresponding steady state flux vsteady\n(thin curve). (c) Oscillatory time courses of [NADH] (thin) and [DHAP] (thick\ncurve) are out of phase by \u2206\u03c6 = 1.2 at k6ADH =2300 min\u22121 . Average concentrations\nhcit have been subtracted and [NADH] has been scaled by a factor of 10 in (b,c). (d)\nBoth concentrations oscillate almost in phase (\u2206\u03c6 = 0.2) at larger k6ADH , here 4600\nmin\u22121 . (e) The relative difference of fluxes (vosc \u2212 vsteady )/vsteady (thick) is partly\ndue to varying phase shift \u2206\u03c6 (thin curve) between the time courses of substrate\nDHAP and cofactor NADH. Parameters are [Glcx ]0 =15mM and [Kx ]=10mM.\n\nconcentrations change with k6ADH . The biotransformation flux towards carbinol\nis affected by changes of similar absolute size which, however, amount to slight\nrelative changes only.\nIn the left half of the oscillatory interval, the averaged oscillatory flux to\nglycerol is even smaller than in steady state which is only possible for a large\nphase shift, as observed in Fig. 6 (c). The effect of the phase shift becomes\ndominant for large oscillation amplitudes because it clearly matters, if the\nreaction partners frequently collide when they appear at the same time or if\nthey only rarely react when one of them is always too late. This situation is\nanalogous to a problem in electrical engineering where the electrical power at\na device in a sinusoidal alternating current (AC) depends on the amplitudes\n15\n\n\fof voltage and current and on the phase shift between their maxima.\n\n4\n\nConclusions and perspective\n\nWe have compared predictions of two theoretical models that have previously\nbeen used to describe glycolytic oscillations in yeast. Both models possess the\nsame topology but incorporate different levels of kinetic details. Irrespective of\nthese differences, both models predicted identical dependencies of temporally\naveraged fluxes and concentrations on the strength of the perturbation, i.e. the\nextracellular concentration of a xenobiotic ketone. This observation provides\nconfidence in theoretical modeling given the topology of the network is known\nand completely incorporated. Note, the unknown parameters of the models\nwere fitted to data of the unperturbed system hence the models predicted\nthe response to the perturbation. The chosen perturbation affected the entire\nnetwork via multiple feedback loops of cofactors. We suggest the exposure to\nxenobiotics as a feasible experimental probe of the network's global response.\nIn the future we will extend this analysis to metabolic responses in other\neucaryotes and to a range of pharmacologically active compounds.\nThe kinetic details of both models affected the temporal organisation of the\nresponses. Oscillations ceased to exist in the abstract core model while the\nfull scale model supported oscillations for a large range of perturbations. Oscillatory behavior has recently been suggested by Hauser et al. to protect\nenzymes and possibly cells against toxic substances [38,39]. Oscillations also\nplay an important role for calcium signal transduction [40] where they appear in bursts [41,42]. Bursting, the temporally repeated sequence of quiescent and oscillating episodes, has recently been found in a theoretical study\nof stochastically driven glycolysis [43]. Oscillations have also been suggested\nto improve the thermodynamic efficiency of glycolysis with respect to steady\noperation [44]. Furthermore, kinetic details are important for (non periodic)\nshort term responses to glucose pulses [10].\nA closer inspection of the flux distribution in oscillatory states revealed that\ntemporally averaged fluxes may differ from the values in the coexisting (unstable) steady state, albeit for each metabolite the (unstable) steady state\nconcentration equals the temporally averaged value in the oscillatory state.\nThis effect results from the relative phase shift between time courses of substrates and cofactors particularly at branch points of the network. The time\naverage of any oscillatory flux is generally restricted to a convex combination of\nelementary flux modes [45]. However, allosterically regulated enzymes impose\nadditional restrictions on the fluxes at given metabolite concentrations which\ncan result in suboptimal convex combinations particularly in steady states.\nOscillatory states possess additional degrees of freedom, i.e. phase shifts, that\n16\n\n\fare adjusted by many even remote reactions. Evolution of metabolic networks\nmay therefore have acted faster on those networks capable of oscillatory behavior enabling them to explore more possibilities and to become superior.\nThis conjecture is in line with the observed oscillatory behavior in one of the\nmost important and inherited metabolic pathways, i.e. glycolysis, and it supports the view that oscillatory behavior may be more abundant than presently\nrecognised [38,39].\n\nA corresponding strategy for metabolic engineering may target the phase shifts\nin oscillatory states as has been suggested by Ross and coworkers [46]. They\nforced simple reaction schemes with oscillating substrate concentrations to\nincrease desired fluxes. Here we found that the same effect is also important for\nlarge metabolic networks where phase shifts are adjusted in a self-organizing\nfashion. The artificial addition of appropriate buffers or bypasses (as in the\npresent example) in order to control phase shifts are promising candidates for\nmetabolic engineering.\n\nIn terms of modeling strategies, one should treat those approaches with caution\nthat focus on steady states, e.g. canonical modeling [47], since the computed\nflux distribution in an unstable steady state does not necessarily approximate the actual oscillatory behavior around that steady state. Continuation\nalgorithms as applied in the present paper appear to be particularly suited\nto address the (dis)advantages of oscillatory versus (hypothetical) stationary\nbehavior.\n\nTo summarize, we have shown that static features of the metabolic network of\nglycolysis are robust to crude abstractions of models but more care has to be\ntaken when dynamic features are considered. Many open questions remain and\ncall for further research work. E.g. the possibility to conduct ketone-to-carbinol\nbiotransformations under aerobic conditions could increase the NADH recycling and hence the carbinol production which, per se, is an important biotechnological challenge. Further modeling will help to solve the related problems\nby simulating the effect of suppressing or enhancing parts of the complex\nmetabolic network.\n\nWe are indebted to Markus B\u00e4r, Sune Dan\u00f8, Jean-Marie Fran\u00e7ois, Ursula\nKummer, Karl-Heinz van P\u00e9e, Preben Graae S\u00f8rensen and Jana Wolf for fruitful discussions.
