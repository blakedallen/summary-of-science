We show that the validity of a recently isolated condition ensuring the existence of the\nthermodynamic limit forces the covariance matrix to exhibit the Parisi\nreplica symmetry breaking scheme with a convexity condition on the\nmatrix elements.\n\n1\n\n\fThe existence of the thermodynamic limit has been recently proved for\nthe Sherrington-Kirckpatrick (SK) model [1], and more generally for any\ncorrelated Gaussian random energy (CGREM) model including the Derrida\nREM and the Derrida-Gardner GREM [2]. In this letter we point out that\nthe proof of [2] may shed some light on the origin of Parisi's algebraic ansatz\nfor the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) scheme which lies at the basis his\nsolution [3] of the SK model.\nAlgebraically, Parisi's ansatz may be described as follows: start from the\none by one matrix q(0) > 0. Take q(1) as 0 < q(0) < q(1) < 1 first replicate\nthe system\n\uf8eb\n\nR(q(0)) = \uf8ed\n\nq(0) q(0)\nq(0) q(0)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(1)\n\n\uf8f8,\n\nthen break the symmetry\n\uf8eb\n\nBR(q(0)) = \uf8ed\n\nq(1) q(0)\nq(0) q(1)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\n(2)\n\nIf we iterate n times the operation BR we end up with the Parisi RSB matrix\nof order n, [BR]n (q(0)) = Q(n) .

Hence q(x(q)) = q and the elements q(1), . . . , q(k) are\noverlaps.\nEven though it has been recently proved that the Parisi free energy is\nat least a lower bound of the SK free energy[4], the RSB is still far from\na mathematical understanding. A major puzzle is still represented by the\norigin of the algebraic structure of the Parisi ansatz, which lies at the basis\nalso of the Derrida-Gardner GREM[5].\nIn this letter we point out that the algebraic Parisi ansatz and, equivalently, the Derrida-Gardner GREM are generated by a precise prescription\nto reach monotonically the thermodynamic limit with a family of correlated\ngaussian random energy models (CGREM).\nMore precisely, we will build by recurrence over N, increasing the size by\n1 at each step (equivalently, adding a spin) a family E\u03c3 (N) of CGREM for\nwhich we require:\n1. E\u03c3 (N) (N-spins) has to be a subsystem of E\u03c3 (N + 1) (N + 1-spins);\n3\n\n\f2. The sequence E\u03c3 (N) fulfills the conditions ensuring the existence of the\nthermodynamic limit.\nThe two previous conditions imply that the matrix sequence CN fulfills the\nRSB scheme, in the sense that for each N the correlation matrix CN fulfills\nthe Parisi ansatz at step N. In particular E\u03c3 (N) can be identified with the\nDerrida-Gardner GREM with a convex growth scheme.\nFor N = 0 the system is the vacuum (no particles) with random energy\nE0 = \u03be0 (0)\n\n(5)\n\n\u03be0 is a centered Gaussian variable with variance c(0), which we can consider\nas a one-by-one matrix. We include the system of 0 spins into a new onespin system (for short: we add a spin) assuming at first that the one-spin\nHamiltonian doesn't depend on the added spin\n\u1ebc1 (\u03c31 ) = \u03be0 (0) ;\nthe covariance matrix of this process is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nc(0) c(0)\n\uf8f8 ;\nC\u0303(1) = \uf8ed\nc(0) c(0)\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nThis construction was called lifting in [2].\nThe one-spin system is a CGREM of size one only if its covariance matrix is a (non-degenerate) positive definite matrix. The elimination of the\ndegenarcy requires the introduction in the Hamiltonian of a new Gaussian\nvariable \u03be1 parametrizing the dependence on the added spin:\nE1 (\u03c31 ) = \u03be0 (1) + \u03be1 (1)\u03c31 ;\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fthe covariance matrix element is\nAv(E1 (\u03c31 )E1 (\u03c41 )) = Av(\u03be0 (1)2 ) + Av(\u03be1 (1)2 )\u03c31 \u03c41 ;\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c3\u03c4 = 2\u03b4\u03c3,\u03c4 \u2212 1\n\n(10)\n\nSince\n\nwe have\nAv(E1 (\u03c31 )E1 (\u03c41 )) = Av(\u03be0 (1)2 ) \u2212 Av(\u03be1(1)2 ) + 2Av(\u03be1(1)2 )\u03b4\u03c31 ,\u03c32\n\n(11)\n\nwhich we will write as\nAv(E1 (\u03c31 )E1 (\u03c41 )) = a0 (1) + a1 (1)\u03b4\u03c31 ,\u03c32 .\nDefining c(l) =\n\nPl\n\nk=0\n\n(12)\n\nak we have\n\uf8eb\n\nC(1) = \uf8ed\n\nc(1) c(0)\nc(0) c(1)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(13)\n\nwith c(1) > c(0)\nTo iterate the procedure, let us first describe the second step, i.e. the\naddition of a second spin to build a 2-spin system. As before, we first assume\nindependence on the newly added spin variable. The covariance matrix turns\nthen out to be (with the lexicographic order of\n\uf8eb\nc(1) c(1) c(0)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec c(1) c(1) c(0)\nC\u0303(2) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec c(0) c(0) c(1)\n\uf8ed\nc(0) c(0) c(1)\n5\n\nthe spin configurations)\n\uf8f6\nc(0)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nc(0) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 .\n(14)\n\uf8f7\nc(1) \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\nc(1)\n\n\fAgain, this matrix is the covariance of a CGREM process only if it positive definite and non-degenerate. As above, this requires the dependence on\nthe second spin variable. Among the possible ways to parametrize this dependence we choose the minimal one, namely the preceding one which only\nmodifies the subprincipal diagonals:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nc(1) q\u03042 c(0) c(0)\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec q\u03042 c(1) c(0) c(0) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8ec\nC\u0304(2) = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec c(0) c(0) c(1) q\u03042 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nc(0) c(0) q\u03042 c(1)\n\n(15)\n\nwith c(0) < q\u03042 < c(1). We relabel the elements c(1) \u2192 c(2) and q\u03042 \u2192 c(1)\nobtaining the final 2-spin covariance matrix\n\uf8eb\nc(2) c(1) c(0)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec c(1) c(2) c(0)\nC(2) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec c(0) c(0) c(2)\n\uf8ed\nc(0) c(0) c(1)\n\nc(0)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nc(0) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\nc(0) \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\nc(2)\n\n(16)\n\nwith c(2) > c(1) > c(0) > 0.
