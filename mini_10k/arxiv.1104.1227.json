In many\nearlier works on power control, each user has a fixed minimum SINR requirement and then minimizes its\ntransmit power subject to the SINR requirement [1, Ch. 2][2][3]. This approach is suitable for fixed-rate\ncommunications with voice applications. However, with the growing importance of data and multimedia\napplications, users are no longer satisfied with a fixed SINR requirement, but they seek to maximize their\nutility reflecting the quality of service (QoS). To this end, most recent works formulate the problem in\nthe network utility maximization framework. In this framework, a central controller can compute optimal\ntransmit power levels when the utility functions are such that the network utility maximization problem\nis convex, and then assigns the optimal power levels to users. Assuming that users are obedient to the\ncentral controller, the problem can also be solved in a distributed manner [1, Ch. 4][4][5].\nBesides the network utility maximization framework, many works use noncooperative games to model\nthe distributed power control problem, in which each user maximizes its own utility, instead of maximizing\nthe network utility. In a noncooperative game model with a single frequency channel, each user tends to\ntransmit at its maximum power level to obtain high throughput, causing excessive interference to other\nusers. This outcome may be far from the global optimality of social welfare [1][4][6], especially when\ninterference among users is strong [7]. To improve the noncooperative outcome, various power control\nschemes have been proposed based on pricing [8]\u2013[12], auctions [13], and mechanism design [14][15].\nThese works aim to achieve a better outcome by modifying the objective functions of users using taxation\nand developing a distributed method based on the optimization of the modified objective functions. Users\nare assumed to be obedient in that they accept the objective functions and follow the rule prescribed by\nthe designer, and prices are used as control signals to guide users to a desired outcome. However, selfish\nusers may have their own innate objectives which are different from the assigned objectives and may\nignore control signals and deviate from the prescribed rule if they are better off by doing so.\nIn summary, the methods in most existing works are not suitable for power control with selfish users.\nSelfish behavior of users can arise in many practical scenarios without central controllers, such as wireless\nad hoc networks, where each user transmits information from its own transmitter to its own receiver,\nand multi-cell cellular networks, where the base station cannot control the interfering mobile stations\nin other cells. Hence, it is important to design an incentive scheme to induce selfish users to achieve\na desirable outcome in power control scenarios. One method to provide incentives for selfish users is\nto impose taxation as real money payment. However, in order to achieve a desired outcome with a\npricing scheme, the designer needs to know how payment affects the payoffs of users, which is often\nthe private information of users. The designer may use a mechanism design approach as in [14][15] to\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f3\n\nelicit private information, but it generally requires heavy communication overheads.1 Another method\nto provide incentives is to use repeated games [16][17]. However, effective incentive schemes based on\nrepeated games require users to have long-run frequent interactions and to be sufficiently patient [18].\nRecently, a new class of incentive schemes has been proposed based on the idea of intervention [19]\u2013\n[21]. To implement an intervention scheme, we need an intervention device that can monitor the actions of\nusers and intervene in their interaction if necessary. The monitoring technology of the intervention device\ndetermines what it can observe about the actions of users, while its intervention capability determines\nthe extent to which it can intervene in their interaction. An intervention rule prescribes the action that the\nintervention device should take as a function of its observation. Among existing works on intervention\nschemes, [19] and [20] applied intervention schemes to contention games in the medium access control\n(MAC) layer, while [21] studied the impact of the monitoring technology and the intervention capability\non the system performance in an abstract model. We also note that [22] proposed a packet-dropping\nmechanism for queueing games using an idea similar to intervention. In this paper, we focus on a power\ncontrol scenario and study intervention schemes in this particular scenario.\nIn the power control scenario considered in this paper, the intervention device estimates the individual\ntransmit power of each user or the aggregate receive power at its receiver and then transmits at a certain\npower level following the intervention rule prescribed by the designer. In order to achieve a target\noperating point, the designer can use an intervention rule such that the intervention device transmits\nminimum, possibly zero, power if users are transmitting at the desired power levels, while transmitting\nat a high power level to reduce the SINRs of users if a deviation is detected. In this way, an intervention\nscheme can punish the misbehavior of users and regulate the power transmission of selfish users. We\nfirst consider a monitoring technology with which the intervention device can estimate the individual\ntransmit power of each user without errors. While focusing on a simple class of intervention rules called\nfirst-order intervention rules, we study the requirements for the parameters of first-order intervention\nrules to achieve a given target power profile as a (unique) Nash equilibrium (NE). We propose a\ndynamic adjustment process that the designer can use to guide users to the target power profile through\nintermediate targets. We then relax the monitoring requirement and consider a monitoring technology\nwith which the intervention device can estimate only the aggregate receive power. We show that with\naggregate observation, intervention rules can be designed to achieve a given target as a NE but rarely as\n1\n\nAnother drawback of [14] and [15] is the assumption that each user's utility function is jointly concave in all the users'\n\npower levels, which seems to be unrealistic in power control scenarios.\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f4\n\na unique NE. Our results provide a systematic design principle based on which a designer can choose\nan intervention scheme (an intervention device and an intervention rule) to achieve a desired outcome.\nOur analysis suggests that, unlike pricing schemes, it is possible for the designer to design effective\nintervention schemes without having knowledge about how users value their SINRs, as long as their utility\nis monotonically increasing with their own SINRs. We also propose a method based on intervention for\nthe designer to estimate the cross channel gains, the noise powers, and maximum transmit power levels of\nusers without any cooperative behavior of users such as sending pilot signals for channel estimation and\nreporting the estimates to the designer. After obtaining relevant information, the designer can configure\nan intervention rule to achieve a target operating point as NE.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the system model of power\ncontrol with intervention. In Section III, we propose design criteria for intervention rules, performance\ncharacteristics to evaluate intervention rules, and classes of intervention rules. In Section IV, we study\nthe design of first-order intervention rules to achieve a target power profile. In Section V, we discuss\nimplementation issues related to intervention. Simulation results are presented in Section VI. Finally,\nSection VII concludes the paper. For the ease of reference, we summarize major notation used in this\npaper in Table I.\nII. M ODEL\n\nOF\n\nP OWER C ONTROL W ITH I NTERVENTION\n\nWe consider a single-hop wireless ad hoc network, where a fixed set of N users and an intervention\ndevice transmit in a single frequency channel. The set of the users is denoted by N , {1, 2, . . . , N }. Each\nuser has a transmitter and a receiver. Each user i chooses its transmit power pi in the set Pi , [0, Pi ], where\nQ\nPi > 0 for all i \u2208 N . The power profile of all the users is denoted by p = (p1 , . . . , pN ) \u2208 P , N\ni=1 Pi ,\nand the power profile of all the users other than user i is denoted by p\u2212i .\n\nIn the network, there is an intervention device, sometimes referred to as user 0, that consists of a\ntransmitter and a receiver. The receiver of the intervention device can monitor the power profile of the\nusers, while the transmitter can create interference to the users by transmitting power. Once the users\nchoose their power profile, the intervention device obtains a signal y \u2208 Y , where Y is the set of all\npossible signals. We assume that the signal is realized deterministically given a power profile and use the\nsignal determination function \u03c1 : P \u2192 Y to denote the signal given the power profile p.2 After observing\n2\n\nMore generally, we can assume that the signal is realized randomly given a power profile and use \u03c1(p) to represent the\n\nprobability distribution of signals given p. We leave the analysis of this general case for future research.\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f5\n\nTABLE I\nS UMMARY OF M AJOR N OTATION .\n\nSymbol\n\nDescription\n\nN\n\nNumber of (regular) users in the network\n\nN\n\nSet of users, N , {1, . . . , N }\n\nPi\n\nMaximum transmit power level of user i; i \u2208 N\n\nP0\n\nPower budget of the intervention device, or the intervention capability\n\nPi\n\nUser i's action space Pi , [0, Pi ]; i \u2208 N \u222a {0}\n\npi\np\n\nTransmit power level of user i, pi \u2208 Pi ; i \u2208 N \u222a {0}\nQ\nPower profile of the users, p = (p1 , . . . , pN ) \u2208 P , N\ni=1 Pi\n\np\u22c6\n\nTarget power profile, p\u22c6 = (p\u22c61 , . . . , p\u22c6N )\n\nP\n\nProfile of the maximum power levels, P = (P1 , . . . , PN )\n\nhij\n\nChannel gain from user j's transmitter to user i's receiver; i, j \u2208 N \u222a {0}\n\nni\n\nNoise power at user i's receiver\n\n\u03b3i\n\nSINR at user i's receiver\n\nY\n\nSet of all possible signals obtained by the intervention device\n\n\u03c1\n\nSignal determination function, \u03c1 : P \u2192 Y\n\nf\n\nIntervention rule, f : Y \u2192 P0\n\nE (f )\nFK (p\u22c6 )\n\nSet of power profiles sustained by f\nSet of Kth-order intervention rules with target power profile p\u22c6\n\nP BK (p\u22c6 )\n\nMinimum power budget to sustain p\u22c6 using Kth-order intervention rules\n\ns\nP BK\n(p\u22c6 )\n\nMinimum power budget to strongly sustain p\u22c6 using Kth-order intervention rules\n\nf1I\n\nFirst-order intervention rule based on individual transmit powers\n\n\u03b1i\n\nIntervention rate for user i in f1I ; i \u2208 N\n\nf1A\n\nFirst-order intervention rule based on aggregate receive power\n\n\u03b10\n\nAggregate intervention rate in f1A\n\n\u00d1 (p\u22c6 )\n\nSet of users whose target powers are less than the maximum power levels, \u00d1 (p\u22c6 ) = {i \u2208 N : p\u22c6i < Pi }\nNumber of users whose target powers are less than the maximum power levels, N \u2032 = |\u00d1 (p\u22c6 )|\n\nN\u2032\n{(f t , pt )}Tt=1\n{p\u0303t }Tt=1\n\nSequence of intervention rules and power profiles in the dynamic adjustment process\n\nd(p, p )\n\nSequence of intermediate target power profiles in the dynamic adjustment process\nP\n\u2032\nRelative distance between two power profiles p and p\u2032 , d(p, p\u2032 ) = N\ni=1 (pi \u2212 pi )/pi\n\nT \u22c6 (p\u22c6 )\n\nMinimum convergence time (in steps) for the dynamic adjustment process to reach p\u22c6\n\n\u2032\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f6\n\na signal, the intervention device chooses its own transmit power p0 in the set P0 , [0, P0 ], where P0 > 0.\nWe call (Y, \u03c1) the monitoring technology of the intervention device, and call P0 its intervention capability.\nThe ability of an intervention device is characterized by its monitoring technology and intervention\ncapability. We call the transmit powers of the intervention device and the users (p0 , p) \u2208 P0 \u00d7 P an\noutcome.\nThe QoS obtained by user i is determined by its SINR, denoted by \u03b3i . We use a block-fading channel\nmodel with sufficiently long fading blocks, as in [2]\u2013[5],[7]\u2013[17]. In one block, for i, j \u2208 N \u222a {0}, let hij\nbe the channel gain from user j 's transmitter to user i's receiver, and let ni be the noise power at user i's\nreceiver. If code-division multiple accessing (CDMA) is used, the channel gain is defined as the effective\nchannel gain taking into account the spreading factor. In one block, the users and the intervention device\ntransmit at constant power levels p and p0 , respectively.3 Then the SINR of user i \u2208 N is given by\n\u03b3i (p0 , p) =\n\nh p\nP ii i\n.4\nhi0 p0 + j6=i hij pj + ni\n\n(1)\n\nWe assume that each user i \u2208 N has monotonic preferences on its own SINR in the sense that it weakly\nprefers \u03b3i to \u03b3i\u2032 if and only if \u03b3i \u2265 \u03b3i\u2032 . Our analysis does not require any other properties of preferences\n(for example, preferences do not need to be represented by a concave utility function).5\nIn our setting, the intervention device has a receiver to measure the aggregate receive power from all\nthe users. Furthermore, if the receiver moves and takes measurement at different locations, it can estimate\nthe individual transmit power of each user as well. Thus, in this paper we will focus on two types of\nmonitoring technology with which the intervention device can estimate individual transmit powers p or\nP\nan aggregate receive power N\ni=1 h0i pi . In other words, we consider two signal determination functions,\nPN\n\u03c1(p) = p and \u03c1(p) = i=1 h0i pi .\n3\n\nIn practice, there is a time lag between when the users transmit and when the intervention device transmits because the\n\nintervention has to monitor the users' power profile in order to decide its transmit power level. In this paper, we assume that\nthis time lag is short and negligible compared to the length of fading blocks, although in principle we can take into account the\ntime lag in the users' utility functions. See, for example, [20] for a model that takes into account the time lag explicitly.\n4\n\nThroughout the paper, we use j 6= i with the summation operator to mean j \u2208 N \\ {i}, not j \u2208 N \u222a {0} \\ {i}.\n\n5\n\nThe preferences of a user may be defined on dimensions other than its SINR. For example, a user may use the ratio of SINR\n\nto transmit power as the utility function, as in [9], because it may care about its energy consumption as well. Our approach can\nbe applied to such a scenario if utility functions representing the users' preferences are known to the designer.\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f7\n\nIII. D ESIGN\n\nOF I NTERVENTION\n\nRULES\n\nA. Design Criteria\nSince the intervention device transmits its power after it obtains a signal, its strategy can be represented\nby a mapping f : Y \u2192 P0 , which is called an intervention rule. The SINR of user i when the intervention\ndevice uses an intervention rule f and the users choose a power profile p is given by \u03b3i (f (\u03c1(p)), p). With\nan abuse of notation, we will use f (p) to mean f (\u03c1(p)). Given an intervention rule f , the interaction\namong the users that choose their own power levels selfishly can be modeled as a non-cooperative game,\nwhose strategic form is given by\n\u0393f = hN , (Pi )i\u2208N , (\u03b3i (f (*), *))i\u2208N i.\n\n(2)\n\nWe can predict the power profile chosen by the users given an intervention rule using the concept of\nNash equilibrium.\nDefinition 1: A power profile p\u2217 \u2208 P is a Nash equilibrium of the game \u0393f if\n\u03b3i (f (p\u2217 ), p\u2217 ) \u2265 \u03b3i (f (pi , p\u2217\u2212i ), pi , p\u2217\u2212i )\n\n(3)\n\nfor all pi \u2208 Pi and all i \u2208 N .\nWhen a power profile p\u2217 is a NE of \u0393f , no user has the incentive to deviate from p\u2217 unilaterally\nprovided that the intervention device uses intervention rule f . Moreover, if p\u2217 is a unique NE of \u0393f ,\nintervention has robustness in that the designer does not need to worry about coordination failure (i.e.,\nthe possibility that the users get stuck in a \"wrong\" equilibrium).\nDefinition 2: An intervention rule f (strongly) sustains a power profile p\u2217 if p\u2217 is a (unique) NE of\nthe game \u0393f .\nWe use E(f ) to denote the set of all power profiles sustained by f . Suppose that the designer has a\nwelfare function U0 (\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ), defined on the users' SINRs. Then the objective of the designer is to\nfind a target power profile that maximizes the welfare function and an intervention rule that (strongly)\nsustains the target power profile. Formally, the design problem solved by the designer can be written as\nmax max{U0 (\u03b31 (f (p), p), . . . , \u03b3N (f (p), p)) : p \u2208 E(f )}.\np\n\nf\n\n(4)\n\nIf uniqueness is desired, we can replace p \u2208 E(f ) in (4) with {p} = E(f ). Note that a solution to the\ndesign problem (4), p\u22c6 and f \u2217 , must satisfy f \u2217 (p\u22c6 ) = 0, namely no intervention if the users choose the\ntarget power profile. Based on this observation, the design problem (4) can be solved in two steps. In\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f8\n\nthe first step, we obtain a target power profile p\u22c6 by solving\nmax{U0 (\u03b31 (0, p), . . . , \u03b3N (0, p)) : p \u2208 P}.\np\n\n(5)\n\nThere always exists a solution to the optimization problem (5) as long as the welfare function U0 is\nP\ncontinuous in \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N . Under some welfare functions, e.g. U0 (\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3N ) N\ni=1 log(\u03b3i ) as in [4][5],\n\nthe optimization problem (5) is convex, and thus easy to solve. If (5) is solved off-line, the designer\ncan choose other welfare functions even though the resulting optimization problem is nonconvex. In the\nsecond step, we look for an intervention rule f such that f (p\u22c6 ) = 0 and p\u22c6 \u2208 E(f ) (or {p\u22c6 } = E(f )),\ngiven the target power profile p\u22c6 obtained in the first step.\nThe first step of solving the design problem (4), namely finding the target power profile p\u22c6 , requires\nknowledge about the parameters in the model, hij , ni , and Pi for all i, j \u2208 N \u222a {0}. In Section V-A,\nwe propose a method for the designer to estimate the relevant system parameters needed to solve (5)\nbased on intervention. Note, however, that solving the problem (5) does not require the designer to know\nthe details of the users' preferences on their SINRs since knowing the expressions for SINRs suffices\nto evaluate the welfare function and to check the incentive constraints. To highlight the informational\nadvantage of our approach, let us consider a pricing scheme, in which each user i is charged \u03c0i (p) when\nthe users choose a power profile p. Suppose that each user i has quasilinear preferences on its own SINR\nand payment which are represented by a utility function of the form ui (\u03b3i ) \u2212 \u03c0i . Then in order to find\na pricing scheme that sustains a target profile p\u22c6 , the designer needs to know ui for all i \u2208 N . Since a\npricing scheme uses an outside instrument to influence the decisions of the users, the designer needs to\nknow how the users value SINRs relative to payments, which is subjective and thus hard to measure. On\nthe contrary, an intervention scheme affects the users through their SINRs, and thus the designer does\nnot need to know how the users value their SINRs.\nIn the subsequent discussion of this paper, we focus on the second step of solving the design problem\n(4), assuming that a target power profile p\u22c6 has been found. That is, we aim to find an intervention rule f\nthat (strongly) sustains p\u22c6 , namely p\u22c6 \u2208 E(f ) (or {p\u22c6 } = E(f )), and that satisfies f (p\u22c6 ) = 0. Since user\ni can guarantee a positive SINR by choosing a positive power, it is impossible to provide an incentive\nQ\nfor user i to choose pi = 0 using any intervention rule. Thus, we assume that p\u22c6 \u2208 i (0, Pi ]. We say\n\nthat (f, p\u22c6 ) is an (intervention) equilibrium if p\u22c6 \u2208 E(f ) and f (p\u22c6 ) = 0. At an equilibrium, no user has\n\nan incentive to deviate unilaterally while the designer fulfills his design criteria. Thus, an equilibrium\ncan be considered as a stable configuration of an intervention rule and a power profile. An equilibrium\ncan be achieved following the procedure described below.\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f9\n\n1) The designer chooses a target power profile p\u22c6 and an intervention rule f .\n2) The users choose their power profile p, knowing the intervention rule chosen by the designer.6\n3) The intervention device obtains a signal \u03c1(p) and chooses its power p0 = f (p).\nTo execute the above procedure, we may consider an adjustment process (e.g., one based on best-response\nupdates) for the users and the intervention device to reach an equilibrium (see Section IV-B), as well as\nan estimation process for the intervention device to obtain a signal (see Section V-A). It is an implicit\nunderlying assumption of our analysis that the time it takes to reach a final outcome (i.e., the duration\nof the procedure) is short relative to the time for which the final outcome lasts. This justifies that in\nour model, the users fully take into account interference from the intervention device that is realized\nat the final outcome when they make decisions about their powers. When a network parameter changes\n(e.g., some users leave or join the network, or move to different locations), a new target is chosen\nand the procedure is repeated to achieve a new equilibrium. Thus, our analysis holds as long as network\nparameters do not change frequently, whereas providing incentives using a repeated game strategy usually\nrequires an infinite horizon and sufficiently patient players.\nAnother important underlying assumption in our analysis is that the designer can commit to the\nintervention rule it chooses. Since U0 is increasing in each \u03b3i and each \u03b3i is decreasing in p0 , the\ndesigner prefers not to intervene at all, i.e., it prefers to choose p0 = 0. However, if p0 is held fixed at 0,\nthe users will choose P. The role of the intervention device is to provide a punishment mechanism for\nthe users to choose a desired power profile other than P; the device should choose a high power level if\na deviation is detected. Without the designer's commitment to the intervention rule, the designer would\nchoose p0 = 0 (e.g., by disabling the intervention device) regardless of the power profile chosen by the\nusers. Predicting this behavior of the designer, the users would choose P, resulting in the same outcome\nas with no intervention. Therefore, in order for the proposed intervention schemes to provide incentives\nsuccessfully, it is critical that the designer executes punishment as promised to make punishment credible.\nIn practice, credibility can be achieved by programming the intervention rule in the intervention device\nand making the program difficult to manipulate.\nFinally, the benchmark is the welfare when there is no intervention device in the network, i.e., p0 is\nheld fixed at 0. In this case, \u03b3i is always strictly increasing in pi , and thus P , (P1 , . . . , PN ) is the\n6\n\nThe intervention rule can be broadcast to the users, or learned by the users from experimentation.\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f10\n\nunique NE of the game hN , (Pi )i\u2208N , (\u03b3i (0, *))i\u2208N i.7 Thus, the case of p\u22c6 = P is trivial, because there\nis no need to use an incentive scheme in order to achieve the power profile P. Hence, our main interest\nlies in the case of p\u22c6 6= P, although our analysis does not exclude the case of p\u22c6 = P. The case of\np\u22c6 6= P arises in many situations, for example, when interference among users is strong and welfare is\n\nmeasured by the sum of utilities or the minimum of utilities [1][4][6][7].\nB. Performance Characteristics\nGiven a target power profile p\u22c6 , there are potentially many intervention rules f that satisfy the design\ncriteria p\u22c6 \u2208 E(f ) and f (p\u22c6 ) = 0. Thus, below we propose several performance characteristics with\nwhich we can evaluate different intervention rules satisfying the design criteria.\n1) Monitoring requirement: The minimum amount of information about the power profile that is\nrequired for the intervention device to execute a given intervention rule (assuming perfect estimation).\n2) Intervention capability requirement: The minimum intervention capability needed for the intervention\ndevice to execute a given intervention rule, i.e., supp\u2208P f (p). (Even though there is no intervention at an\nequilibrium, the intervention device should have an intervention capability P0 \u2265 supp\u2208P f (p) in order\nto make the intervention rule f credible to the users.)\n3) Strong sustainment: Whether a given intervention rule strongly sustains the target power profile p\u22c6 .\n4) Complexity: The complexity of a given intervention rule in terms of design, broadcast/learning, and\ncomputation.\nC. Classes of Intervention Rules\nWithout loss of generality, we can express an intervention rule f satisfying f (p\u22c6 ) = 0 as f (p) =\n[g(p)]P0 0 , where [x]ba = min{max{x, a}, b}, for some function g : P \u2192 R such that g(p\u22c6 ) = 0. Also,\n\nsince the designer desires to achieve p\u22c6 , it is natural to consider functions g that increase as the users\ndeviate from p\u22c6 . Hence, we consider the following classes of intervention rules,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n#P0\n\"N K\n\uf8f2\n\uf8fd\nXX\nFK (p\u22c6 ) = f : f (p) =\nfor some \u03b1i,k \u2265 0 and P0 > 0 ,\n\u03b1i,k |pi \u2212 p\u22c6i |k\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\ni=1 k=1\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nfor K = 1, 2, . . .. We call an intervention rule f \u2208 FK (p\u22c6 ) a K th-order intervention rule with target\npower profile p\u22c6 . As K becomes larger, the set FK (p\u22c6 ) contains more intervention rules, but at the\n7\n\nThis is true for any constant intervention rule, where p0 is chosen independently of the observation of the intervention device.\n\nThis shows the inability of traditional Stackelberg games, where the leader (the intervention device) takes an action before the\nfollowers (the users) do, to provide incentives in our setting.\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f11\n\nsame time complexity increases. Simple intervention rules are desirable for the designer, the users, and\nthe intervention device. As K is smaller, the designer has less design parameters and less burden of\nbroadcasting the intervention rule; the users can more easily learn the intervention rule and find their\nbest responses during an adjustment process; and the intervention device can more quickly compute the\nvalue of the intervention rule at the chosen power profile. Thus, our analysis mainly focuses on first-order\nintervention rules, the simplest among the above classes.\ns (p\u22c6 )) be the set of all K th-order intervention rules that (strongly) sustains p\u22c6 , i.e.,\nLet F\u0303K (p\u22c6 ) (F\u0303K\ns (p\u22c6 ) = {f \u2208 F (p\u22c6 ) : {p\u22c6 } = E(f )}. We define the\nF\u0303K (p\u22c6 ) = {f \u2208 FK (p\u22c6 ) : p\u22c6 \u2208 E(f )} and F\u0303K\nK\n\nminimum power budget8 for a K th-order intervention rule to (strongly) sustain p\u22c6 by\nP BK (p\u22c6 ) =\n\ninf\n\ns\nsup f (p), and P BK\n(p\u22c6 ) =\n\nf \u2208F\u0303K (p\u22c6 ) p\u2208P\n\ninf\n\nsup f (p).\n\n(7)\n\ns\nf \u2208F\u0303K\n(p\u22c6 ) p\u2208P\n\ns (p\u22c6 )), there exists a K th-order\nThus, with an intervention capability P0 > P BK (p\u22c6 ) (P0 > P BK\ns (p\u22c6 ) = +\u221e) if there\nintervention rule that (strongly) sustains p\u22c6 . We set P BK (p\u22c6 ) = +\u221e (P BK\ns (p\u22c6 )) is empty). Since\nis no K th-order intervention rule that (strongly) sustains p\u22c6 (i.e., F\u0303K (p\u22c6 ) (F\u0303K\ns (p\u22c6 ) are weakly\nFK (p\u22c6 ) \u2282 FK \u2032 (p\u22c6 ) for all K, K \u2032 such that K \u2264 K \u2032 , both P BK (p\u22c6 ) and P BK\n\ndecreasing in K for all p\u22c6 .

A NALYSIS\n\nOF\n\nF IRST-O RDER I NTERVENTION RULES\n\nA. Design of Intervention Rules\nWe consider first-order intervention rules of the form\n# P0\n\"N\nX\n\u22c6\nI\n\u03b1i |pi \u2212 pi |\n.\nf1 (p) =\ni=1\n\n(8)\n\n0\n\nUnder a first-order intervention rule, the intervention device increases its transmit power linearly with\nthe deviation of each user from the target power, |pi \u2212 p\u22c6i |, in the range of its intervention capability. We\ncall \u03b1i the intervention rate for user i, which measures how sensitive intervention reacts to a deviation\nof user i. Let \u00d1 (p\u22c6 ) = {i \u2208 N : p\u22c6i < Pi }. Without loss of generality, we label the users in such a way\n8\n\nAs to be shown later, for strong sustainment, we need P0 to exceed a certain value. Thus, we actually mean \"infimum\"\n\npower budget by minimum power budget.\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f12\n\nthat i \u2208 \u00d1 (p\u22c6 ) if and only if i \u2264 N \u2032 , where N \u2032 = |\u00d1 (p\u22c6 )|. Since the users have natural incentives to\nchoose their maximum powers in the absence of intervention, we need to provide incentives only for the\nusers in \u00d1 (p\u22c6 ). The following theorem shows that when the intervention capability is sufficiently large,\nthe designer can always find intervention rates to have a given target power profile p\u22c6 sustained by a\nfirst-order intervention rule.\nTheorem 1: For any p\u22c6 \u2208\n\nQ\n\np\u22c6 \u2208 E(f1I ) if and only if\nP\n\u22c6\nj6=i hij pj + ni\n\u03b1i \u2265\np\u22c6i hi0\n\ni (0, Pi ],\n\nand\nP0 \u2265\n\nP\n(Pi \u2212 p\u22c6i )( j6=i hij p\u22c6j + ni )\np\u22c6i hi0\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nfor all i \u2208 \u00d1 (p\u22c6 ).\nProof: See [23, Appendix B].\nWe can interpret Theorem 1 as follows. As hi0 is larger, intervention causes more interference to user\ni with the same transmit power, and thus the intervention rate \u03b1i can be chosen smaller to yield the\nP\nsame interference. When j6=i hij p\u22c6j + ni is large, interference to user i from other users and its noise\n\npower are already strong, and thus the intervention rate \u03b1i should be large in order for intervention to be\nP\neffective. Hence, hi0 /( j6=i hij p\u22c6j + ni ) can be interpreted as the effectiveness of intervention to user i.\n\nWithout intervention, users have natural incentives to increase their transmit powers. Thus, as the target\n\npower for user i, p\u22c6i , is smaller, the incentive for user i to deviate is stronger, and thus a larger intervention\nrate \u03b1i is needed to prevent deviation. Note that (Pi \u2212 p\u22c6i ) is the maximum possible deviation by user\ni (in the direction where it has a natural incentive to deviate). The minimum intervention capability in\n\nthe right-hand side of (10) is increasing with the maximum possible deviation and the strength of the\nincentive to deviate while decreasing with the effectiveness of intervention.\nA first-order intervention rule f1I satisfying the conditions in Theorem 1 may have a NE other than the\nP\ntarget power profile p\u22c6 . For example, if P0 \u2264 j6=i \u03b1j (Pj \u2212 p\u22c6j ) for all i \u2208 \u00d1 (p\u22c6 ), P is also sustained\nby f1I . The presence of this extra NE is undesirable since it brings a possibility that the users still choose\n\nP while the intervention device causes interference to the users by transmitting its maximum power\nP0 . Obviously, this outcome (P0 , P) is worse for every user than the outcome at the unique NE without\n\nintervention (0, P). In order to eliminate this possibility, the designer may want to choose an intervention\nrule that strongly sustains the target power profile. The following theorem provides a sufficient condition\nfor a first-order intervention rule to strongly sustain a given target power profile.\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f13\n\nTheorem 2: For any p\u22c6 \u2208\n\nQ\n\n{p\u22c6 } = E(f1I ) if\nP\nP\n\u22c6\n1 X\nj<i hij pj +\nj>i hij Pj + ni\n\u22c6\n\u03b1i > \u22c6\n\u03b1j (Pj \u2212 pj ) +\n\u22c6\npi\npi hi0\n\n(11)\n\nP\nP\n(Pi \u2212 p\u22c6i )( j<i hij p\u22c6j + j>i hij Pj + ni )\nPi X\n\u22c6\n\u03b1j (Pj \u2212 pj ) +\nP0 > \u22c6\npi\np\u22c6i hi0\n\n(12)\n\ni (0, Pi ],\n\nj>i\n\nand\n\nj>i\n\nfor all i \u2208 \u00d1 (p\u22c6 ).9\nProof: See [23, Appendix C].\nBy comparing Theorems 1 and 2, we can see that the requirements for the intervention rates and the\nintervention capability is higher when we impose strong sustainment. For any given power profile, the\nintervention rates can be chosen sequentially to satisfy the condition (11) starting from user N \u2032 down\nto user 1. We can set \u03b1i = 0 for all i \u2208\n/ \u00d1 (p\u22c6 ). Unlike Theorem 1, the choice of the intervention rates\naffects the minimum required intervention capability. For strong sustainment, the intervention capability\nis required to be larger as the designer chooses larger intervention rates. A main reason for the existence\nof an extra NE is that the region of power profiles on which the maximum intervention power is applied\nis so wide that the users cannot escape the region by unilateral deviation. Thus, a larger intervention\ncapability is needed to reduce the region and guarantee the uniqueness of NE.\nFrom Theorem 1, we obtain\n\u22c6\n\nP B1 (p ) = max\ni\n\nP\n(Pi \u2212 p\u22c6i )( j6=i hij p\u22c6j + ni )\np\u22c6i hi0\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nSince Theorem 2 gives a sufficient condition for strong sustainment, we obtain an upper bound on\nP B1s (p\u22c6 ),\ns\n\nP B 1 (p\u22c6 ) =\n\nN\nX\ni=1\ns\n\n\uf8ee\uf8eb\n\uf8f0\uf8ed\n\nj=1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f9\nP\nP\n(Pi \u2212 p\u22c6i )( j<i hij p\u22c6j + j>i hij Pj + ni )\n\uf8f8\n\uf8fb.\np\u22c6j\np\u22c6i hi0\n\ni\u22121\nY\nPj\n\n(14)\n\nNote that P B1 (p\u22c6 ) \u2264 P B 1 (p\u22c6 ) with equality if and only if N \u2032 \u2264 1. Combining these results, we can\nbound P B1s (p\u22c6 ) by\ns\n\nP B1 (p\u22c6 ) \u2264 P B1s (p\u22c6 ) \u2264 P B 1 (p\u22c6 ).\n\nBy Theorems 1 and 2, we know that first-order intervention rules can sustain the set\n\n(15)\nQ\n\ni (0, Pi ].\n\nNote\n\nthat among all the efficient power profiles, those with pi = 0 for some i have probability measure zero.\n9\n\nWe define\n\nP\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nj\u2208J\n\nxj = 0 if J is empty. Similarly, we define\n\nQ\n\nj\u2208J\n\nxj = 1 if J is empty.\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f14\n\nHence, we obtain almost the entire set of feasible payoffs by using first-order intervention rules. As\nargued in Section III, it is impossible to provide an incentive for user i to choose pi = 0 by intervention\nrules of any orders. Thus, we actually obtain the largest set of sustainable payoffs by using first-order\nintervention rules. This discussion suggests that the potential gain from using higher-order intervention\nrules is not from what they can sustain but how they sustain a target power profile.\nRemark 1: An extreme intervention rule feI [21], defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 0, if p = p\u22c6 ,\nI\nfe (p) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 P0 , if p 6= p\u22c6 ,\n\n(16)\n\ncan be considered as the limiting case of first-order intervention rules as each \u03b1i goes to infinity in that the\narea of the region {p : feI (p) 6= f1I (p)} approaches zero in the limit. With this class of intervention rules,\nwe have E(feI ) = {p\u22c6 , P} if P0 \u2265 P B1 (p\u22c6 ) and E(feI ) = {P} otherwise. Therefore, it is impossible\nto construct an extreme intervention rule that strongly sustains a target power profile, except in the\nuninteresting case p\u22c6 = P. This motivates us to study intervention rules other than extreme intervention\nrules.\nB. Dynamic Adjustment Processes\nPreviously, we have derived the conditions under which a target power profile is (strongly) sustained.\nNow we propose a dynamic adjustment process, in order to guide the intervention device and the users to\nachieve the target power profile as NE. The adjustment occurs at discrete steps, labeled as t = 1, 2, . . . .\nWe allow the use of different intervention rules in different steps. Thus, the beginning of each step is\ntriggered by the intervention device's announcement of the intervention rule to be used in that step. Users\nare synchronized by the announcement of the intervention rules. The adjustment process is based on the\nmyopic best-response updates of the users and is described in Algorithm 1.\nDuring the adjustment process, the designer may use different intervention rules, as well as intermediate\ntarget profiles different from the final target p\u22c6 . That is, we have f t \u2208 F1 (p\u0303t ), where p\u0303t is the intermediate\ntarget power profile at step t. In the adjustment process, the designer chooses a sequence of intervention\nrules.

In addition to requiring a larger\npower budget, Theorem 3 imposes a restriction on the range of target profiles. That is, the target should\nbe close enough to P for the result of Theorem 3 to hold. However, the target may not satisfy the\nPN\n\u22c6\nrestriction\ni=1 (Pi \u2212 pi )/Pi < 1. In this case, the designer needs to use intermediate target power\nprofiles that are successively close to one another in order to guide the users to the final target. The\nuse of intermediate target power profiles is also necessary when the intervention device does not have a\nlarge enough power budget to strongly sustain a target power profile. In this case, the designer can use\na sequence of intervention functions to drive the users to reach the target power profile as the unique\noutcome. This process requires smaller power budget than that required by strong sustainment, but may\ntake longer time for the system to reach the target power profile.\nDefine the relative distance from p to p\u2032 by\nd(p, p\u2032 ) =\n\nN\nX\npi \u2212 p\u2032\n\ni\n\ni=1\n\npi\n\n.\n\n(20)\n\nUsing the proofs of Theorems 2 and 3, we can show that, given pt\u22121 , the designer can achieve the\nintermediate target at step t, i.e., pt = p\u0303t only if p\u0303t satisfies d(pt\u22121 , p\u0303t ) < 1. This imposes a bound\non the relative distance between two successive intermediate targets. Below we provide two different\nmethods for the designer to generate intermediate targets. The first method, which is summarized in\nAlgorithm 2 and analyzed in Theorem 4, produces a sequence of intermediate targets reaching the final\ntarget whose successive elements have a relative distance of \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1) while requiring the minimum\npower budget in each step. This method can be used in a scenario where the power constraint of the\nintervention device does not bind; the designer can fix \u03b4 sufficiently close to 1, and the method will\nallow the system to reach the final target in the minimum number of steps. The second method, which is\nsummarized in Algorithm 3 and analyzed in Theorem 5, yields a sequence of intermediate targets with\nthe largest relative distance in each step while satisfying the power constraint. Thus, this method will\nallow the manager with a limited power budget to reach the final target as fast as possible.\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f17\n\nNow suppose that a fixed relative distance between two successive targets is given.

Relaxation of Monitoring Requirement\nThe results in this section so far relies on the ability of the intervention device to estimate individual\ntransmit powers. However, estimating individual transmit powers requires larger monitoring overhead for\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f20\n\nthe intervention device than estimating aggregate receive power. In order to study intervention rules that\ncan be executed with the monitoring of aggregate receive power, we consider a class of intervention rules\nthat can be expressed as\n\"\n\nf1A (p) = \u03b10\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nh0i pi\n\n!\n\n\u2212 p\u22c6A\n\n# P0\n\n(31)\n\n0\n\nfor some \u03b10 \u2265 0, P0 > 0, and p\u22c6A . We call an intervention rule in this class a first-order intervention rule\nbased on aggregate receive power or, in short, an intervention rule based on aggregate power. We call\n\u03b10 the aggregate intervention rate, and call p\u22c6A the target aggregate power, which is set as the aggregate\nP\n\u22c6\nreceive power at the target power profile, i.e., p\u22c6A = N\ni=1 h0i pi . We first give a necessary and sufficient\n\ncondition for an intervention rule based on aggregate power to sustain a target power profile.\nQ\nTheorem 6: For any p\u22c6 \u2208 i (0, Pi ], p\u22c6 \u2208 E(f1A ) if and only if\nP\n\u22c6\nj6=i hij pj + ni\n\u03b10 \u2265 max\nh0i p\u22c6i hi0\ni\u2208\u00d1 (p\u22c6 )\nand\nP0 \u2265 max\n\ni\u2208\u00d1 (p\u22c6 )\n\nP\n(Pi \u2212 p\u22c6i )( j6=i hij p\u22c6j + ni )\np\u22c6i hi0\n\n.\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\nProof: See [23, Appendix H].\nThe minimum intervention capability required to sustain a target profile is not affected by using\naggregate receive power instead of individual transmit powers. However, the aggregate intervention rate\nshould be chosen high enough to prevent a deviation of any user, whereas with the monitoring of individual\ntransmit powers the intervention rates can be chosen individually for each user. This suggests that strong\nsustainment is more difficult with intervention rules based on aggregate power. For example, P is also\nP\nsustained by f1A if P0 \u2264 \u03b10 j6=i (h0j Pj \u2212 p\u22c6j ) for all i \u2208 \u00d1 (p\u22c6 ), which is weaker than the corresponding\nP\ncondition in the case of intervention rules based on individual powers, P0 \u2264 j6=i \u03b1j (Pj \u2212 p\u22c6j ) for all\ni \u2208 \u00d1 (p\u22c6 ). With the monitoring of individual powers, a deviation of each user can be detected and\n\npunished. This leads to the property that the best response of user i is almost always either p\u22c6i or\nPi under first-order intervention rules based on individual powers. This implies that a power profile\n\nsustained by a first-order intervention rule based on individual powers almost always belongs to the set\nQ \u22c6\ni {pi , Pi }. In contrast, with the monitoring of aggregate power, only an aggregate deviation can be\n\ndetected. This yields a possibility that an intervention rule based on aggregate power sustains a power\nprofile that is different from the target but yields the same aggregate power. This possibility makes the\nproblem of coordination failure more worrisome because if the users are given only the target aggregate\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f21\n\npower p\u22c6A they may not know which power profile to select among those that yield the aggregate power\np\u22c6A .12 The problem arising from the increased degree of non-uniqueness can be considered as the cost\nP\nof reduced monitoring overhead.

Also, let \u1fb10 = maxi\u2208\u00d1 (p\u22c6 ) \u03b1i0 and\nP\u03040 = maxi\u2208\u00d1 (p\u22c6 ) P0i .\n\nQ\n\nj\n\u22c6\ni\ni (0, Pi ], there exist i, j \u2208 \u00d1 (p ) such that (i) \u1fb10 = \u03b10 > \u03b10 or\n\u03b1i0 , \u03b1j0 < \u1fb10 , and (ii) P\u03040 = P0i > P0j or P0i , P0j < P\u03040 .

That is, strong sustainment is generically\nimpossible with intervention rules based on aggregate power when |\u00d1 (p\u22c6 )| \u2265 3.\nV. I MPLEMENTATION I SSUES\nIn this section, we discuss some implementation issues. First, we provide algorithms for the intervention\ndevice to estimate the system parameters and individual transmit powers without user cooperation. Then\nwe compare the communication overhead of the intervention scheme with that of other incentive schemes.\n\nA. Estimation of System Parameters and Individual Transmit Powers\nAs we have seen from previous results (e.g. Theorems 1\u20133), in order to determine the intervention\nrates and the power budget requirement, the designer needs to know the normalized cross channel gains\nij\n{ hhi0\n}N\nj=1,j6=i , \u2200i \u2208 N , the normalized noise powers\n\nni\nhi0 , \u2200i\n\n\u2208 N , the maximum power levels Pi , \u2200i \u2208 N ,\n\nand the target power profile p\u22c6 . We propose a method to estimate the normalized cross channel gains,\nnormalized noise powers, and the maximum power levels without user cooperation. Based on the above\nparameters, the designer can determine the target power profile p\u22c6 by solving (4). In addition, we propose\na method to estimate the individual transmit powers without user cooperation.\n12\n\nA way to overcome this problem is to broadcast the target power profile p\u22c6 to the users in order to make p\u22c6 as a focal\n\npoint [24].\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f22\n\n1) Normalized cross channel gains and noise powers: The designer estimates the normalized cross\nchannel gains and the normalized noise powers by adjusting the intervention rules and observing the\nreaction of the users. First, the designer broadcast the intervention capability P0 and a temporary target\npower profile p\u0303 < P. Then it makes N rounds of measurements at N different locations. We assume\nthat during the measurements, the users always choose the power levels that maximize their SINRs given\nthe intervention rule. Thus, we exclude the strategic behavior of the users to influence the measurements\nin their favor. We also assume that the intervention device can move its receiver to N different locations,\nor it has N receivers located at different locations.\nAlgorithm 4 The nth round of measurement performed by the intervention device.\nRequire: Error tolerance \u03b5 > 0\n1:\n\nInitialization: Broadcast \u03b1j = 0, \u2200j \u2208 N\n\n2:\n\nfor index = 0 to N \u2212 1 do\n\n3:\n\nSet i = (n + index) mod N , \u03b1i = 0, \u1fb1i = 0, \u03b1i any positive value (preferably large)\n\n4:\n\nMeasure the aggregate receive power R\u0304i and set the current aggregate receive power Ri = R\u0304i\n\n5:\n\nwhile \u1fb1i = 0 or \u1fb1i \u2212 \u03b1i > \u03b5 do\n\n6:\n\nif \u1fb1i = 0 and Ri = R\u0304i then\n\n7:\n8:\n9:\n10:\n11:\n\n\u03b1i \u2190 2 * \u03b1i\n\nelse if Ri = R\u0304i then\n\u03b1i \u2190 \u03b1i , \u03b1i \u2190 (\u03b1i + \u1fb1i )/2\n\nelse\n\u1fb1i \u2190 \u03b1i , \u03b1i \u2190 (\u03b1i + \u1fb1i )/2\n\n12:\n\nend if\n\n13:\n\nBroadcast the index i and the new \u03b1i , and measure the current aggregate receive power Ri\n\n14:\n\nif Ri < R\u0304i then\n\n15:\n\nSet Ri = Ri\n\n16:\n\nend if\n\n17:\n\nend while\n\n18:\n\nend for\n\nIn round n, the designer adjusts the intervention rates one by one, starting from \u03b1n to \u03b1N , then from\n\u03b11 to \u03b1n\u22121 .

By bisection methods,\nan estimate of \u03b1\u2217i , denoted by mni , is obtained within the error tolerance \u03b5.

The complexity of this operation is of the order N 3 .\nB. Comparison of Communication Overhead\nNow we compare the communication overhead of the intervention scheme with that of other frameworks, including network utility maximization [4][5], game theoretic control based on taxation [8]\u2013[13],\nand mechanism design [14][15]. Before the comparison, we would like to emphasize that the intervention\nscheme works for selfish users, who have no incentive to provide any information to anyone else. As\nshown in Table II, intervention requires no information flow from the users to the designer. On the\ncontrary, the other works assume that the users are obedient to exchange information with the designer\nor among each other according to some prescribed rules.\nThe communication overhead is measured by the total amount of information flow before the system\nreaches the desired operating point. Specifically, the amount of information flow is measured by the\nnumber of real numbers broadcast by the users and the intervention device, ignoring quantization and\ncoding. The communication overhead can be further categorized into the communication overhead on the\nusers and that on the designer. We summarize the comparison in Table II. In each framework, we select\nrepresentative algorithms to calculate the communication overhead. Hence, the numbers in the table are\nnot precise for all the algorithms, but are correct in terms of the order.\nWe can see from Table II that in intervention, users have zero communication overhead. In other words,\nthe intervention device does not rely on the users to provide information. While in other frameworks,\nusers may be required to broadcast some information. Hence, intervention is more suitable when users\nare selfish and unwilling to provide information truthfully. Another advantage of intervention is that its\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f25\n\nTABLE II\nC OMPARISON OF C OMMUNICATION OVERHEAD OF D IFFERENT F RAMEWORKS\n\nFramework\n\nUsers\n\nThe Designer\n\nOverall\n\nIntervention\n\n0\n\n2N 2 log2 (1/\u03b5) + 2N * T \u22c6 (p\u22c6 )\n\n2N 2 log2 (1/\u03b5) + 2N * T \u22c6 (p\u22c6 )\n\nNetwork utility maximization\n\nN ([4]) or 0 ([5])\n\n0 ([4]) or N ([5])\n\n[4][5]\n\nin each step\n\nin each step\n\nN in each step\n\nN in each step\n\n2N in each step\n\nN 2 in each step\n\nN in each step\n\nN 2 + N in each step\n\nGame theoretic control\n\nN in each step\n\nbased on taxation [8]\u2013[13]\nMechanism design [14][15]\n\ncommunication overhead can be bounded analytically. While in other frameworks, the convergence speed\nto the desired operating point is not guaranteed. The detailed analysis is as follows.\n1) Intervention: The communication overhead of intervention is comprised of two parts. The first part\nis the overhead of estimating normalized cross channel gains and noise powers. The temporary target\npower profile p\u0303 and the intervention capability P0 is broadcast at the beginning, which we omit here.\nThere are N rounds of measurement. In each round, the intervention device needs to broadcast the initial\nintervention rates (line 1 in Algorithm 4), and the indices and the values of the intervention rates it is\nadjusting (line 13 in Algorithm 4). Since it uses bisection methods to adjust the intervention rate, the\nnumber of adjustments is log2 (1/\u03b5) for each intervention rate, where \u03b5 is the error tolerance in estimating\nintervention rates in Algorithm 4. In sum, the communication overhead in estimating system parameters\nis N (2N log2 (1/\u03b5) + 1) \u2248 2N 2 log2 (1/\u03b5) for all intervention rates.\nThe second part is the communication overhead during the convergence to NE. In general, this overhead\ndepends on the target power profile and the intervention capability. If the target power profile is close to\nP\n\u22c6\nthe maximum power level ( N\ni=1 (Pi \u2212 pi )/P i < 1) and the intervention capability is large (Theorem 3),\n\nthe convergence is in one step. If the target power profile is not close enough or the intervention capability\nis limited, we need to use the dynamic adjustment process. The convergence is in N \u2032 + 1 steps if the\nintervention capability is large (Theorem 4), and is in T \u22c6 (p\u22c6 ) steps if the intervention capability is limited\n(Theorem 5). In each step, the intermediate target power profile and the intervention rates are broadcast.\nIn summary, the worst-case communication overhead during the convergence to NE is 2N * T \u22c6 (p\u22c6 ).\n2) Other frameworks: The communication overhead of other frameworks is the total information flow\nduring the convergence to the desired operating point. Unlike intervention, the number of steps during\nthe convergence is not bounded. Hence, the communication overhead could be arbitrarily large.\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f26\n\n1.0\n\nh11\n\nT1\n\nR1\n\nh21\nh01\nh12\n\n0.5\n\nh10\n\nI\nh20\nh02\n\nT2\n\nT2\n\nh22\n\nR2\n\n0.5\n\nFig. 1.\n\nAn example single-hop wireless ad-hoc network with two users.\n\nIf users cooperate with the designer to maximize the assigned utility function, as in [4][5] and [8]\u2013[13],\nthe information flow in one step can be less than that in intervention. In network utility maximization,\neither each user or the base station will broadcast at least N signals for all the users. In [4], each user\nbroadcast its own interference price. In [5], the base station broadcast \"load\" and \"spillage\". In game\ntheoretic control based on taxation [8]\u2013[13], the base station broadcast N prices, usually different for\ndifferent users. To obtain the optimal pricing, users report back some information, such as their payoffs\nor interferences, to adjust prices.\nIn mechanism design [14][15], similar to intervention, the designer does not know the utility function\nof each user. In this case, the information flow in one step is of the same order as that in intervention.\nSpecifically, each user broadcast its own version of optimal power allocation vector in each step, and\nthe designer broadcast the reference power allocation vector. Hence, the amount of information flow is\nN 2 + N in each step.\n\nVI. S IMULATION R ESULTS\nWe consider a two-user network shown in Fig. 1. User 2's transmitter is near to user 1's receiver, causing\nsignificant interference to user 1. The distance from user 1's transmitter to its receiver is normalized to 1.\nOriginally, the distance from user 2's transmitter to its receiver is 0.5. The vertical distance between the\ntwo users' transmitters and that between the two users' receivers are both 0.5.

In the\nsimulation of Fig. 2, we let user 2's transmitter move away from its receiver as shown by the dashed left\narrow, resulting in less interference to user 1. The channel gain h is reciprocal to the distance d with the\npath loss exponent a, namely h = d\u2212a . We assume an indoor environment where a = 3 [25].

Since the power budget requirements are the same\nfor these two intervention rules, we show them in the same figure. Fig. 3(b) shows the minimum power\nbudget to strongly sustain a target power profile obtained by simulation. As we expect, the power budget\nrequirement for strong sustainment is higher. Fig. 3(c) shows the upper bound on the minimum power\nbudget to strongly sustain a target power profile obtained by Theorem 2. We can see that the result in\nTheorem 2 serves as a good upper bound. Finally, Fig. 3(d) shows the upper bound on the minimum\npower budget for strong sustainment and fast convergence obtained by Theorem 3. In this case, the system\nreaches NE in at most two time slots. To achieve this fast convergence, the intervention device needs\na much higher power budget. In addition, not all the target power profiles can be sustained. The target\npower profiles that cannot be sustained lie in the shadow area in the figure.\nC. Power Budget and Convergence Time Tradeoff In Dynamic Adjustment Process\nNow we study the tradeoff between the power budget and the convergence time in the dynamic\nadjustment process. Here the convergence time is measured as the number of steps in the adjustment\nprocess. To better illustrate the tradeoff, we use a five-user network in the simulation for Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f30\n120\nUpper bound\nGeometric sequence\nMRD sequence\n\nConvergence time in the number of steps\n\n110\n100\n90\nMinimum power budget\nthat sustains the\ntarget power profile\n\n80\n\nMinimum power budget\nthat strongly sustains\nthe target power profile\n\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\nPower budget in dB\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nFig. 5. Given power budget requirements, the convergence time of different sequences of intermediate target power profiles in\nP\nP \u2212p\u22c6\na five-user network. The relative distance between the maximum power profile and the target power profile is 5i=1 iPi i =\n3.6 > 1.\n\nThe channel gains and noise powers used in the simulation are one realization of the random variables.\nSince different realizations result in similar tradeoff, we only show the results for one realization. The\ntarget power profile is p\u22c61 = P1 and p\u22c6i = 0.1Pi for i > 1. Since the relative distance between the\nP\n\u22c6\ni\n= 3.6 > 1, we cannot reach the\nmaximum power profile and the target power profile is 5i=1 PiP\u2212p\ni\n\ntarget power profile from the maximum power profile directly using Theorem 3. Instead, we need a\nsequence of intermediate target power profile before we reach the final target power profile.\nFirst, suppose that there is no power budget requirement. Without power budget limit, our goal is to\nreach the final target power profile in as few time slots as possible. Since it is not easy to construct a\nsequence of intermediate target power profiles given a desired convergence time, we construct the sequence\naccording to the desired relative distance between adjacent intermediate target power profiles, which is\nan indicator for the convergence time. In Fig. 4, we show the convergence time and the power budget\nrequirement of the MRD sequence generated by Algorithm 2 and the geometric sequence under different\nrelative distances. We can see from Fig 4(a) that a larger relative distance results in a faster convergence\nfor both sequences. Thus, we can use the relative distance, a metric amenable for the construction of the\nsequence, to control the convergence speed of the adjustment process. In particular, when the relative\ndistance is \u03b4 = 0.9 = 1\u2212 mini {p\u22c6i /Pi }, the MRD sequence converges in N \u2032 + 1 = 5 steps as predicted by\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f31\n\nTheorem 4. In Fig 4(b), we can see that for both sequences, the power budget requirement is decreasing\nwith the relative distances in most cases. The power budget is lower for the MRD sequence. For both\nsequences, it requires much less power by the dynamic adjustment process than by the strong sustainment\ncondition in Theorem 2.\nSecond, suppose that there is a power budget requirement. Given different power budget requirements,\nwe show the convergence time of MRD and geometric sequences and the upper bound on the convergence\ntime in Fig. 5. We can see from the figure that under most power budget requirements, the convergence\ntime of MRD sequence is roughly half of that of the naive geometric sequence. When the power budget\nis small (near to the minimum power budget that sustains the target power profile), the fast convergence\nof MRD sequence is even more significant compared to that of the geometric sequence. When the\npower budget approaches the minimum requirement that strongly sustains the target power profile, the\nconvergence time of MRD sequence is 5, which is half of that of the geometric sequence.\nVII. C ONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we proposed incentive schemes based on intervention for power control in singlehop wireless ad hoc networks with selfish users. We formulated a game-theoretic model of power\ncontrol with an intervention device and proposed design criteria that desirable intervention rules should\nsatisfy. Focusing on a simple class of intervention rules called first-order intervention rules, we provided\nrequirements for intervention rules to sustain a target power profile when the intervention device estimates\nindividual transmit powers or aggregate receive power. We also proposed dynamic adjustment processes\nto guide users to a target power profile through intermediate targets. We discussed implementation issues\nand presented simulation results. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate\nintervention schemes in a power control scenario. For future research, we can apply intervention schemes\nto different power control scenarios, for example, a scenario where users can allocate their power budgets\nacross multiple channels and a scenario where users care about their energy consumption as well as their\ndata rates.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] M.
