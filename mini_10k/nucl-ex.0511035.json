In this article femtoscopic results from a small system (p+p collisions)\nand a large system (Au+Au collisions) measured by the same experiment, at the same\ncollision energy and detector acceptance are presented for the first time in high energy\nphysics. The particular focus is on the mT dependence of HBT radii and an attempt to\nunderstand its origins for different initial sizes of the emitting source is made.\n\nANALYSIS DETAILS\nThe STAR Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [2] was used to reconstruct particles of interest. Particle identification was achieved by measuring momentum and specific ionization\nlosses of charged particles in the gas of TPC (dE/dx technique). A large data statistics\nin Au+Au, Cu+Cu and d+Au collisions allows to do an analysis for different centralities. Additionally, d+Au data set allows to extract p+Au collisions. It is performed by\nselecting events with a single neutron tagged in the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) in\nthe deuteron beam direction.\nIn this study pions with transverse momentum 0.10 GeV/c < pT < 1.00 GeV/c were\nused and the analysis was done for four bins of kT within a range of [0.15, 0.60] GeV/c.\n\n\fTwo-track effects due to splitting (one particle reconstructed as two tracks) and merging\n(two particles reconstructed as one track) were removed from the data.\nThe dependence of the correlation function on the transverse momentum is studied as\na function of three components of pair relative momentum in a Pratt-Bertsch coordinate\nsystem [3, 4] in the longitudinally co-moving frame. The fit was performed using a\nmethod suggested by Bowler [5] and Sinyukov [6] assuming Gaussian parametrization\nof the source. For more details on analysis technique see [11].\n\nSYSTEM EXPANSION AND MULTIPLICITY SCALING\nOne of the differences that may be expected between such a large system as Au+Au\nand a small system as p+p is the expansion. This can be studied in a model-dependent\napproach when the final RMS of the system is compared to the initial one. The first value\nis equal, with good accuracy, to Rside calculated for the lowest kT range ([0.15, 0.25]\nGeV/c). The second one is calculated with Glauber model for nuclei and a proton initial\nsize was taken from an e\u2212 scattering [12] as a reference. The result of this comparison\n\u221a\nfor p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at the same energy of the collision ( sNN\n= 200 GeV) are combined on the left panel of Figure 1a.\nAs seen, the most central Au+Au collisions undergo an expansion by a factor of two\nwhile p+p collisions show no or a little expansion. Data points from peripheral d+Au\ncollisions show similarity to p+p while central d+Au points exhibit an expansion like in\nperipheral Cu+Cu. Finally, central Cu+Cu expands similarly like peripheral Au+Au.\nFigure 1b presents the HBT radii dependence on (dNch /d \u03b7 )1/3 (dNch - number of\ncharged particles at midrapidity) for different colliding systems and at different energies\nof the collisions. The motivation for studying such a relation is its connection to the final\nstate geometry through the particle density at freeze-out.

STAR Au+Au data from [11]; b) Femtoscopic\nradii dependence on the number of charged particles.\n\n\fd+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions, are combined on the left panel of this figure and,\nas seen, all radii exhibit a scaling with (dNch /d \u03b7 )1/3 . On the right panel of this figure\nSTAR radii, this time for different kT range, are plotted together with AGS/SPS/RHIC\nsystematics [1]. It is impressive that the geometric radii (Rside and Rlong ) follow the\nsame curve for different collisions over a wide range of energies and, as it was checked,\nthis observation is valid for all kT bins studied by STAR. It is a clear signature that the\nmultiplicity is a scaling variable that drives geometric HBT radii at midrapidity. Rout\nmixes space and time information. Therefore it is unclear whether to expect the simple\nscaling with the final state geometry. Although, because of the finite intercepts of the\nlinear scaling [1, 7], results do not confirm predictions that freeze-out takes place at the\nconstant density [8]. Additionally, this scaling was verified at midrapidity only, and some\ndependence on rapidity outside this region may be expected [9, 8] so it is not obvious if\nthe scaling holds then.\nAs a result of this study, one can venture to predict the size of the source at midrapidity\nwithout knowing anything about the collision (like energy, N part , impact parameter, etc.)\nexcept for the multiplicity [9, 8, 1]. This scaling is expected to persist for all systems\nthat are meson dominated but is violated for low energy collisions that are dominated by\nbaryons [9, 1, 10].\n\nTRANSVERSE MASS DEPENDENCE OF HBT RADII\nIn heavy ion collisions a decrease of HBT radii with an increase of mT is commonly\nassociated with the transverse flow of a bulk matter [11]. Natural question would be\nwhether this dependence looks different in smaller systems like p+p or d+Au and what\nis the origin of this dependence. On Figure 2a the three dimensional radii from p+p\nand d(p)+Au collisions are plotted vs mT . For these systems femtoscopic sizes decrease\nwith the increase of the transverse mass and d+Au results show also the dependence\non the centrality like it is observed in Au+Au collisions [11]. Additionally, the value\nof Rside and Rlong for p+Au collisions is similar to p+p collisions while Rlong is more\nlike in d+Au collisions. Although it has to be emphasized that due to the way of\nextracting p+Au events from d+Au sample p+Au results correspond rather to peripheral\np+Au collisions so the size of the source is expected to be larger for central collisions.\nTherefore, results suggest that the size of the source in p+Au collisions is not the same as\nin p+p. Comparison of the peripheral d+Au collisions, that include about 15% of p+Au\ncollisions, with and without extracted p+Au events show no significant difference but\nthat may be due to a fact that the d+Au sample still includes n+Au events that cannot be\nexcluded from the data.\nIn elementary particle collisions, resonance production contributes significantly to\nthe mT dependence of the HBT radii [13], while in heavy ion collisions, flow effects\ndominate this dependence [14]. The other scenarios that can give the similar dependence\nare the Heisenberg uncertainty and the string fragmentation [15].\nOn Figure 2b the ratio of the three dimensional radii in Au+Au, Cu+Cu and d+Au\ncollisions to p+p radii is plotted vs mT . Surprisingly, these ratios look flat although it is\nexpected that different origins drive the transverse mass dependences of the HBT radii\nin Au+Au and p+p collisions. If these expectations are correct the data show that one\n\n\f0.6\n\nd+Au (0-20)%\nd+Au (20-40)%\nd+Au (40-100)%\nd+Au (p+Au excl.)\np+Au\np-p\n\n0.2\n\nRO ratio\n\n\u03bb\n\n0.4\n\nAu+Au (0-5%) / p+p\n\n8\n\nAu+Au (50-80%) / p+p\n\n6\n\nCu+Cu (0-10%) / p+p\n4\n\n2\n\n8\n\nSTAR preliminary\n\n8\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\nmT [GeV/c ]\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n2\n\nmT [GeV/c ]\n\n0.5\n\nRO /RS\n\n1\n1\n\n0.8\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n0.4\n2\nmT [GeV/c ]\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n0.4\n2\nmT [GeV/c ]\n\nRL ratio\n\n1.2\n\nRL [fm]\n\nd+Au (40-100%) / p+p\n\n1\n\nRS ratio\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nRs [fm]\n\nRO [fm]\n\nd+Au (0-20%) / p+p\n\nSTAR preliminary\n\n0.5\n\n\u221a\nFIGURE 2. a) mT dependence of HBT radii and \u03bb in p+p and d(p)+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV;\n\u221a\nb) Ratio of HBT radii from Au+Au, Cu+Cu and d+Au by p+p collisions at sNN = 200 GeV.\n\nmay not distinguish different physics between p+p and Au+Au collisions studying pion\ninterferometry.\nAn alternative explanation of this phenomena came from a work done by Cs\u00f6rg\u0151 et\nal. [16]. Authors using a Buda-Lund hydrodynamic model, that successfully describes\nthe momentum correlations in Au+Au collisions, were able to fit STAR p+p spectra\nand HBT radii. But in this case they claim that the transverse mass dependence of the\nfemtoscopic sizes is not generated by the transverse flow, but by the temperature inhomogeneities of hadron-hadron collisions due to the freezing scale. Then the conclusion\nfrom this study would be that in p+p collisions the system has similar bulk properties as\nin Au+Au collisions.\nNon-identical particle correlations like \u03c0 -K or \u03c0 -p in Au+Au collisions show a difference in then average emission points of two particles that is due to flow [17]. Therefore,\nfemtoscopic study of particles with different masses in p+p collisions could be used to\nverify a flow hypothesis in small systems like p+p and d(p)+Au.\n\nEVIDENCE OF NON-FEMTOSCOPIC CORRELATIONS\nWhen doing femtoscopic analysis in p+p and d+Au collisions a problem with nonfemtoscopic correlations has been observed. It is manifested in a non-vanished tail of\n~ In elementary particle collisions [15, 18]\nthe correlation function to unity, for large Q.\nthese non-femtoscopic correlations were also observed and taken into account by adding\nan ad-hoc component to the parametrization of the correlation function that assumes that\n~ depends linearly on the three components of the twothe correlation function for large Q\n\n\f1.6\n\nSTAR Preliminary\nC(Qout)\n\n1.2\n1.1\n\n1.5\n\n0.01\n\n0.00\n\nARE\n00\n\n1.4\n\n0.00\n\n-0.01\n\n1.3\n1.0\n\n-0.02\n\n1.1\n\n-0.03\n\n1.0\nexperimental CF\n\n1.2\n\nC(Qside)\n\n1.1\n\n-0.01\n\n-0.02\n\n1.2\n0.9\n\nARE\n10\n\n-0.04\n\n0.9\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n|Q| [GeV/c]\n\nfit\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n|Q | [GeV/c]\n\n1.0\n\nSTAR PRELIMINARY\n\n0.9\n\n-0.04\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n|Q | [GeV/c]\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n0.00\n\nperipheral d+Au @ 200 GeV\n\n1.2\n\n-0.01\n\n0.000\n\nC(Qlong)\n\n1.1\n\n-0.02\n\nfit\n\n1.0\n\nARE\n11\n\n-0.005\n\n0.9\n0.0\n\nARE\n20\n\n-0.03\n\nkT : [0.15,0.60] GeV/c\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n|Q | [GeV/c]\n\nQo,s,l [GeV/c]\n\nARE\n22\n\n-0.03\n-0.04\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n|Q | [GeV/c]\n\nFIGURE 3. a) 1D projections of 3D correlation function. b) First five non-vanished components of the\nspherical harmonics decomposition of the correlation function. In a) and b) 3D correlations function for\nd+Au peripheral collisions was fitted with parametrization given by Eq.(1)\n\nparticle relative momentum (see equation (1)).\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nC2 (Qout , Qside , Qlong ) = (1+ \u03bb e\u2212(Qout Rout +Qside Rside +Qlong Rlong ) )(1+ \u03b1 Qout + \u03b7 Qside + \u03b6 Qlong )\n(1)\nUsing this parametrization the fit to the STAR p+p and d+Au collisions was performed\nand the femtoscopic radii turned out to be larger up to 30% in comparison to the standard\nparametrization. Figure 3a shows the projections of the 3D correlation function for the\nmost peripheral d+Au collisions (that is STAR worst case) and the projections of the fit\ndescribed above. It looks like the fit matches experimental data with good accuracy but\nmore careful study is required to judge on the correctness of the new parametrization\nand will be performed with method described below.\nA common approach to present 3D correlation function is to project it onto the three\n~ separately, as shown on Figure 3a. The disadvantage of this approach is\ncomponents of Q\nthat when doing such projections one has to constrain non-projected components to keep\na signal but then the full information on the correlation function in the 3D space is lost.\nTo eliminate this inconvenience a new approach of studying correlations was applied\nthat is based on a decomposition of the correlation function into spherical harmonics\n(for detailed description of this method see [19]). In this method no cuts are performed\n~ components what allows to recognize symmetries in Q-space\n~\non Q's\nto see, looking at\n1D plots, relevant aspects of 3D correlation functions.\nFigure3b shows the first few components of the decomposition of the correlation function onto the spherical harmonics for peripheral d+Au collisions. The fitted correlation\nfunction, that includes a new term to account for non-femtoscopic effect, was decomposed using this method. As shown on Figure 3a the new parametrization fits the correlation function with good accuracy but with the spherical harmonic method it is seen\nthat the fit is not correct. Distributions for l=1 are non-zero and A1,0 shows a strong\n~ In a system like \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 at midrapidity all odd components should\ndependence on |Q|.\nvanish by symmetry. Additionally, the new parametrization does not fit the baseline of\nthe correlation function that has an evidence in non-vanished A2,0 and A2,2 distributions\n\n\f~\nfor large |Q|.\nThis study shows that it is not sufficient to look at the Cartesian projections of the\ncorrelation function to judge about the quality of the fit and the correctness of the used\nparametrization. It is required to use spherical harmonic method to see the experimental\ndata and the fit in the 3D space.\nThe analytic formulas of spherical harmonics are well-known so the A2,0 and A2,2\ndistributions may be parametrized and included in the fit. Such study was presented in\n[20] and it showed a good agreement with experimental data. Due to the lack of the\nspace the results are not presented here, but the radii in p+p and d+Au collisions are\nchanged up to 10% the most, although the mT scaling described in the previous section\npersists.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of pion interferometry for several energies and colliding systems at RHIC\nhave been presented. In agreement with data at SPS and AGS, STAR indicates that the\nmultiplicity is the scaling variable that determines the size of the source at freeze-out\nat midrapidity. The mT dependence of HBT radii seems to be independent of collision\nspecies or multiplicity. Finally, a problem with the baseline of the correlation function\nfor low multiplicity collisions has been reported, and a promising tool based on the\nspherical harmonic decomposition of the correlation function has been used in order to\naddress it. The physics of this structure remains under investigation. The advantage of\nthis method in studying the correctness of the parametrization of the correlation function\nused in a fit has been shown.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. M. Lisa, S. Pratt, R. Solz, U.
