We present a simple Bellman function proof of a bilinear estimate for elliptic operators in divergence form with real coefficients and with nonnegative potentials. The constants are dimension-free. The p-range of applicability of this estimate\nis (1, \u221e) for any real accretive (nonsymmetric) matrix A of coefficients.\n\n1. Motivation\nThe bilinear-embedding-type theorems as the one we prove below for general second\norder operators in divergence form with potentials, Lu := \u2212div(A\u2207u)+V u, where A is a\nreal accretive matrix and V a nonnegative locally integrable function on Rn , have so far\nplayed an important part in estimates of several singular integral operators. In [17, 11]\nthe bilinear embedding was used for Lp estimates of the Ahlfors-Beurling operator T .\nIn particular, that implied a regularity result for solutions of Beltrami equations at\nthe critical exponent, which, in its turn, had a geometric significance for the theory of\nquasiregular maps; see [1].\nWhen applied to families of operators on spaces of arbitrary dimensions, the bilinear\nembedding tends to give dimension-free estimates with sharp behaviour in terms of p.\nThe first such example is [9], where dimension-free estimates were obtained for Riesz\ntransforms associated to the classical and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Laplacians. This\napproach was continued in [8] in the context of arbitrary Schr\u00f6dinger operators with\nnonnegative potentials. As a special case, dimension-free estimates for the HermiteRiesz transforms on Lp were confirmed, with linear behaviour with respect to p.\nRecently, A. Carbonaro and the first author [6] studied a class of Riesz transforms\nin the fairly general setting of complete Riemannian manifolds whose Bakry-Emery\nRicci curvature is bounded from below. The study of such operators was initiated by\nStrichartz [19]. Bakry [5] proved the first dimension-free estimates, whereupon the work\nof Li [12] implied that in the general case the behaviour of the norms with respect to\np is at most quadratic as p \u2192 \u221e. In [6] this was improved by giving linear estimates.\nThey are sharp. Also, while the proofs in [5] and [12] are probabilistic, [6] features the\nfirst analytic proof. The bilinear embedding was instrumental for obtaining all of these\nresults.\nThe operators we consider are also called generalized Schr\u00f6dinger operators, see [7].\nWhen A \u2261 I we have the usual Schr\u00f6dinger operators \u2212\u2206 + V . The fact that A \u2261 I\nmakes them comparatively easy in the theory of general second order accretive operators\nin divergence form, so the emphasis in, say, [9, 8, 6, 10] is on independence of estimates\non the dimension of the underlying manifold.\nThe first author was partially supported by the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology\nof Slovenia (research program Analysis and Geometry, contract no. P1-0291). The second author was\npartially supported by NSF grants DMS-0200713, 0501067, 0758552.\n1\n\n\fOPERATORS IN DIVERGENCE FORM WITH POTENTIALS\n\n2\n\nYet another place where the bilinear embedding featured (under a slight disguise) is\nthe sharp estimate of the weighted Hilbert transform in terms of the Ap norm of the\nweight [16, 18].\nOf course the dimension-free estimates of Riesz transforms were known before. One\ncan find an extensive bibliography in [9] and [12]. We think the approach in [9, 8, 6, 10]\nis a sort of a unified one. Namely, there the proofs are divided into two steps: 1) the\nproof of the bilinear embedding (always dimension-free) and 2) a formula which involves\nholomorphic calculus of the operator L. We would like to emphasize the importance of\nthe second step because of its relations with Kato's problem. The holomorphic calculus\nof general second order accretive operators in divergence form also plays crucial part in\nproving estimates for the related Riesz transforms, see e.g. [2, 4].\nFinally, we would like to acknowledge that the completion of this paper was decisively\nmotivated by recent appearance of a closely related preprint [3] by Auscher, Hoffman\nand Martell. In particular, [3] explains the connection between the results in this paper\nand square function estimates in the context of accretive matrices.\nAcknowledgements. We are grateful to P. Auscher, S. Hofmann, C. Kenig and J.\nPipher who advised us on general second order elliptic operators. Special thanks are to\nJ. M. Martell for several valuable conversations and remarks.\nWe are particularly grateful to Pascal Auscher whose interest made us resume working\non this paper after a pause of over three years.\n2. Elliptic differential operators in divergent form\nLet A = [aij (x)]ni,j=1 be a real accretive n \u00d7 n matrix function on Rn with L\u221e coefficients which is uniformly elliptic, meaning that for some \u03b3 > 0 and \u2200\u03be \u2208 Cn , x \u2208 Rn ,\nRe (A(x)\u03be * \u03be) > \u03b3k\u03bek2 ,\n\nPn\n\n(1)\n\nwhere z * w := 1 zj wj for z, w \u2208 Cn .\nLet V be a nonnegative locally integrable function on Rn . We consider the operator\nn\n\u0011\nX\n\u2202 \u0010\n\u2202u\n(x) + V (x)u(x)\naij (x)\nLu := \u2212 div(A\u2207u) + V u = \u2212\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xj\ni,j=1\n\nand the associated semigroup (Pt := e\u2212tL )t>0 . For precise definitions see [7, Section 1.8]\nor [15, Section 4.7]. Denote furthermore f \u0303(x, t) = (Pt f )(x).\nNext, for a smooth complex-valued function \u03c6 = \u03c6(x, t) on Rn \u00d7 (0, \u221e) introduce\n|\u03c6|2\u2217 := |\u2207\u03c6|2 + V |\u03c6|2 , where x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) and \u2207 = (\u2202x1 , . . . , \u2202xn ) is the spatial\ngradient. That is,\n|\u03c6(x, t)|2\u2217\n\nn\nX\n2\n\u2202\u03c6\n:=\n(x, t) + V (x)|\u03c6(x, t)|2 .\n\u2202xj\n\n(2)\n\nj=1\n\nTake any number p \u2208 [2, \u221e) and denote by q its conjugate exponent, i.e. 1/p + 1/q = 1.\nWhat follows is the main result of the paper, which we call bilinear embedding theorem.\nTheorem 1. Let the operator L be as above. For any f, g \u2208 Cc\u221e (Rn ) we have\nZ \u221eZ\n|f \u0303(x, t)|\u2217 |g\u0303(x, t)|\u2217 dx dt 6 C\u03b3 p ||f ||p ||g||q .\n0\n\nRn\n\n\fOPERATORS IN DIVERGENCE FORM WITH POTENTIALS\n\n3\n\nThe theorem is also valid for 1 < p < 2, in which case the factor on the right becomes\nC\u03b3 q. Moreover, it will emerge from the proof of the theorem that one might take\nC\u03b3 = C max{1, \u03b3 \u22121 }, where C is some absolute constant.\nWhen V = 0, Theorem 1 would obviously follow if we had the following estimate from\nabove:\nZ\nZ\n|u(x)|p dx\n(3)\n(GL u(x))p dx 6 C\nRn\n\nRn\n\nfor all p \u2208 (1, \u221e), where GL u is the square function, i.e.\n\u0010Z \u221e\n\u00111\n2\nGL u(x) :=\n|\u2207Pt u(x)|2 dt .\n0\n\nIn general this inequality is proved for p \u2208 (q\u2212 (L), q+ (L)). Even when A is a real matrix,\n(3) holds only for p \u2208 (1, 2 + \u03b5(n)). See [2, Corollaries 6.3 - 6.7]. On the other hand,\nan interesting paper by Auscher, Hofmann and Martell [3] shows that the cone square\nfunction estimate for real matrices A can be made for the whole range of p \u2208 (1, \u221e).\nThe proof seems to be rather delicate, and as far as it stands now the estimates depend\non the dimension. Our theorem has a strange feature of being dimension-free.\n3. Bellman function\nThe Bellman function technique was introduced into harmonic analysis by Nazarov,\nTreil and the second author in the 1994 preprint version of their paper [14]. The main\ntool in our proofs will be a particular Bellman function, drawn from a function defined\nby Nazarov and Treil [13]. Their example was later extended by the present authors in\n[8]. In this paper we work with a simplified variant of the function from [8]; it comprises\nonly two variables, while the functions from [13, 8] have four.\nThroughout this section we assume that p > 2, q = p/(p \u2212 1) and \u03b4 = q(q \u2212 1)/8 are\nfixed. Observe that \u03b4 \u223c (p \u2212 1)\u22121 .\nLet \u03c6 : R+ \u00d7 R+ \u2212\u2192 R+ be defined by\n\uf8f1\n2 2\u2212q\n\uf8f4\n; up 6 v q\n\uf8f2u v\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(4)\n\u03c6(u, v) = up + v q + \u03b4 2 p\n2\n\uf8f4\nu\n+\n\u2212\n1\nv q ; up > v q .\n\uf8f3\np\nq\nThe Bellman function we use is simply the function Q : C \u00d7 C \u2212\u2192 R\u2212 , defined by\n1\nQ(\u03b6, \u03b7) := \u2212 \u03c6(|\u03b6|, |\u03b7|) .\n(5)\n2\nOur proofs will to a great extent involve estimates of the first- and second-order\nderivatives of Q. Estimating the gradient of \u03c6 is straightforward:\n\u2202u \u03c6 6 C(p) max{up\u22121 , v}\n\nand\n\n\u2202v \u03c6 6 Cv q\u22121 6 C(v + 1) .\n\n(6)\n\nFor the last inequality we used that q \u2212 1 6 1. Now the chain rule naturally implies the\nestimates of \u2202\u03b6 Q and \u2202\u03b7 Q.\nYet while Q is of class C 1 , it is not globally C 2 , because \u03c6 fails to be C 2 along\nthe curves {v = 0} and {up = v q } in R2+ . This proved not to be a major obstacle,\nsince smoothening Q by standard mollifiers enables one in various contexts to apply Q\ncompletely rigorously, see [8, 6, 9]. Hence, for the sake of the clarity of the presentation,\nwe will further proceed as if Q were C 2 everywhere, referring the reader to [8, 6, 9] for\nthe mollifying procedure. A similar smoothening argument was also carried out in [17].\nWith this understanding, the properties of Q are summarized in the theorem below.\n\n\fOPERATORS IN DIVERGENCE FORM WITH POTENTIALS\n\n4\n\nTheorem 2. For any u, v > 0,\n(i) 0 6 \u03c6(u, v) 6 (1 + \u03b4)(up + v q ).\nIf \u03be = (\u03b6, \u03b7) \u2208 C \u00d7 C then there exists \u03c4 = \u03c4 (|\u03b6|, |\u03b7|) > 0 such that\n\u0001\n(ii) \u2212d2 Q(\u03be) > \u03b4 \u03c4 |d\u03b6|2 + \u03c4 \u22121 |d\u03b7|2\n\u0001\n(iii) Q(\u03be) \u2212 dQ(\u03be) \u03be > \u03b4 \u03c4 |\u03b6|2 + \u03c4 \u22121 |\u03b7|2 .\n\nThe first property follows immediately from the definition of \u03c6, while the last two\nwere proved in [8].\nLet us clarify the notation appearing in the preceding theorem. Denote by zj the\nvariables of Q, i.e.\n(z1 , z2 ) := (\u03b6, \u03b7) .\nWrite zj = xj + \u0131yj for j = 1, 2, so that\n1\u0010 \u2202\n\u2202 \u0011\n\u2202\n1\u0010 \u2202\n\u2202 \u0011\n\u2202\n=\n\u2212\u0131\nand\n=\n+\u0131\n.\n\u2202zj\n2 \u2202 xj\n\u2202 yj\n\u2202 z\u0304j\n2 \u2202 xj\n\u2202 yj\nTake \u03c3 = (\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) \u2208 C2 .
