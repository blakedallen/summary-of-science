The scheme proposed inherits the attractive features of the standard potential-expansion method but\nyields a partial-wave expansion that converges more rapidly than in the other methods reported in the literature.\nPACS numbers: 12.20.Ds, 31.30.Jv, 31.10.+z\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCalculations of the one-loop self-energy correction to all\norders in the parameter Z\u03b1 (Z is the nuclear charge number\nand \u03b1 is the fine-structure constant) have a long history. The\nfirst correct evaluation of this correction was performed for\nseveral high-Z ions by Desiderio and Johnson [1] using the\nmethod proposed by Brown, Langer, and Schaefer [2]. Another, much more accurate and powerful method was developed by Mohr [3], who carried out high-precision calculations\nof this correction in a wide range of Z for the ground and the\nfirst excited states of H-like ions [4, 5, 6]. Various extensions\nof this method provided highly accurate evaluations of the\nself-energy correction for higher excited states [7, 8], for the\nextended-nucleus Coulomb potential [9], and for very small\nnuclear charge numbers [10, 11, 12]. Indelicato and Mohr\n[13, 14] presented an important modification of the method,\nin which renormalization is performed completely in coordinate space.\nA different method for evaluation of the self-energy correction, which can be conventionally termed as the potentialexpansion method, was introduced by Snyderman and Blundell [15, 16, 17]. Various numerical schemes based on this\nmethod were presented by other groups [18, 19].\nThere are also other methods developed for evaluation of\nthe self-energy correction which have been less widely used\nso far. A noncovariant method of the so-called partial-wave\nrenormalization was developed by Persson, Lindgren, and Salomonson [20] and by Quiney and Grant [21, 22]. Another\nmethod proposed by Labzowsky and Goidenko [23] is based\non the multiple commutator expansion of the general expressions.\nClosely related to the self-energy is the other dominant\nQED effect, the vacuum-polarization. The first evaluations of\nthis correction to all orders in Z\u03b1 were performed by Soff and\nMohr [24] and by Manakov, Nekipelov, and Fainstein [25].\nMore accurate calculations of the vacuum-polarization correction were carried out later by other groups [26, 27].\nEvaluation of the self-energy correction for a tightly bound\nelectron is nontrivial, to a large extent, due to the fact that this\ncorrection involves the Dirac-Coulomb Green function that is\nnot presently known in the closed analytical form (contrary to\nthe nonrelativistic Coulomb Green function). Consequently,\nthe self-energy correction is expressed as an infinite expan-\n\nsion over the angular momentum of the virtual photon (or,\nequivalently, the total angular momentum of the virtual electron states j = |\u03ba| \u2212 1/2, where \u03ba is the relativistic angularmomentum parameter of the Dirac equation). This expansion (further referred to as the partial-wave expansion) greatly\ncomplicates calculations of the self-energy corrections.\nIn the method by Mohr [3], the summation of the partialwave expansion was performed numerically before integrations over radial coordinates. A large number of terms included into the summation (\u223c 104 ) and usage of the quadruple\narithmetics ensured a high accuracy of the numerical results\nobtained but made the computation rather time consuming. In\nthe extension of this method by Jentschura et al. [10, 11, 12],\nseveral millions of expansion terms included into computation were reported, which became possible due to an elaborate\nconvergence-acceleration technique developed by the authors\nand an extensive usage of modern parallel computer systems.\nOn the contrary, calculations based on the potentialexpansion method [16, 17, 18, 19] are usually performed with\nmuch smaller numbers of partial-wave expansion terms actually included into the computation (\u223c 15 \u2212 40). This is\nachieved (i) by employing a more complete set of renormalization terms that are calculated separately in a closed form,\n(ii) by performing the radial integrations before the partialwave summation (for the discussion of how this influences the\nconvergence rate see Eqs. (1), (2) of Ref. [14] and the related\ntext there), and (iii) by using extrapolation to estimate the contribution of the tail of the expansion. The price to pay is a\nmore complex structure of the subtraction terms (especially,\nin coordinate space) and the necessity to keep the accuracy\nof numerical integrations well under control for each partialwave term, in order to provide a reasonable extrapolation for\nthe tail of the expansion. Still, the method is computationally\nvery cheap and can be directly generalized for calculations of\nhigher-order QED diagrams, where the self-energy loop enters as a subgraph. These advantages have determined the fact\nthat most calculations of higher-order self-energy corrections\nhave been performed by extensions of the potential-expansion\nmethod up to now.\nThe one-loop self-energy correction is traditionally represented in terms of the dimensionless function F (Z\u03b1), which\nis connected to the energy shift (in units ~ = c = m = 1) by\n\u2206E =\n\n\u03b1 (Z\u03b1)4\nF (Z\u03b1) ,\n\u03c0 n3\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere n is the principal quantum number. Practical calculations performed within the potential-expansion method in the\nFeynman gauge show that the general behavior of individual\npartial-wave expansion contributions to the function F (Z\u03b1)\nroughly follows the dependence\nF|\u03ba| \u2248\n\nn3\n.\n10 (Z\u03b1)2 |\u03ba|3\n\n(2)\n\nThis makes clear that, while the nominal rate of convergence\nof the partial-wave expansion is always close to |\u03ba|\u22123 in this\nmethod, the actual convergence is governed by the parameter n3 /(Z\u03b1)2 , whose numerical value can be rather large for\nexcited states and small nuclear-charge numbers. Taking into\naccount that the extension of the partial-wave summation beyond the typical limit of |\u03ba| = 30 \u2212 40 leads to serious technical problems within the numerical scheme employed, we\nconclude that the parameter n3 /(Z\u03b1)2 defines the region of\nthe practical applicability of the potential-expansion method.\nSimilar situation persists in calculations of self-energy corrections to higher orders of perturbation theory. In such calculations, the convergence of the partial-wave expansion also\nworsens with decrease of Z and increase of n. In particular, a slow convergence of this expansion turned out to be the\nfactor limiting the accuracy in evaluations of the self-energy\ncorrection to the 1s and 2s hyperfine splitting in low-Z ions\n[28, 29, 30]. This convergence also posed serious problems\nin calculations of the self-energy correction to the boundelectron g factor in light H-like ions [31, 32, 33, 34].\nThe convergence rate of the partial-wave expansion becomes most crucial in the case of two-loop self-energy corrections, for which the summation should be performed over\ntwo independent expansion parameters, both of which are unbound [35, 36]. A calculation of the two-loop self-energy correction for very low nuclear charge numbers (and, specifically,\nfor hydrogen) is a challenging problem, which apparently cannot be solved within a straightforward generalization of the\npotential-expansion method. (The present status of calculations of the two-loop self-energy correction can be found in\nRef. [37]). One of the problems to be solved to this end is\nto find a way to improve the convergence properties of the\npartial-wave expansion.\nThe goal of the present investigation is to formulate a\nscheme for evaluation of the one-loop self-energy correction,\nwhich yield the fastest convergence of the partial-wave expansion among the methods reported so far in the literature.\n\nwhere \u03b1\u03bc = (1, \u03b1), \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the Dirac matrices,\nG(\u03c9, x1 , x2 ) = [\u03c9 \u2212 H(1 \u2212 i0)]\u22121 , H = H0 + V (x),\nH0 = \u03b1 * p + \u03b2 is the free Dirac Hamiltonian, V (x) is a\nlocal potential (not necessarily the Coulomb one), and \u03b4m is\nthe mass counterterm. D\u03bc\u03bd is the photon propagator defined\nin the Feynman gauge as\n\u221a\n2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd exp(i \u03c9 + i0 x12 )\nD (\u03c9, x12 ) = g\n,\n(4)\n4\u03c0 x12\nwhere x12 = |x12 | = |x1 \u2212 x2 |, and\n\u221a the branch of the square\nroot is fixed by the condition Im( \u03c9 2 + i0) > 0. In Eq. (3)\nit is assumed that the unrenormalized part of the expression\nand the mass counterterm are regularized in a certain covariant\nway and that the limit removing the regularization is taken\nafter the cancellation of the divergent terms.\nUltraviolet divergencies in Eq. (3) can be conveniently isolated by separating the first two terms in the expansion of the\nbound-electron propagator G in terms of the binding potential\nV,\nG(E, x1 , x2 ) = G(0) (E, x1 , x2 ) + G(1) (E, x1 , x2 )\n+ G(2+) (E, x1 , x2 ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere G(0) = [\u03c9 \u2212 H0 (1 \u2212 i0)]\u22121 is the free Dirac Green\nfunction, G(1) is the first-order expansion term\nZ\nG(1) (E, x1 , x2 ) = dz G(0) (E, x1 , z) V (z) G(0) (E, z, x2 ) ,\n\n(6)\nand G(2+) is the remainder. The three terms in Eq. (5), after\nsubstitution into Eq. (3), lead to the separation of the selfenergy correction into the zero-potential, one-potential, and\nmany-potential parts [15]:\n\u2206E = \u2206Ezero + \u2206Eone + \u2206Emany ,\n\n(7)\n\nwith the mass-counterterm part naturally ascribed to the zeropotential term. Converting the first two terms into momentum\nspace and cancelling the ultraviolet divergences, one obtains:\nZ\ndp\n(0)\n\u2206Ezero =\n(8)\n\u03c8 (p) \u03a3R (\u03b5a , p) \u03c8a (p) ,\n(2\u03c0)3 a\n\u2206Eone =\n\nZ\n\ndp1 dp2\n\u03c8 (p1 )\n(2\u03c0)3 (2\u03c0)3 a\n\n\u00d7\u03930R (\u03b5a , p1 ; \u03b5a , p2 ) V (q) \u03c8a (p2 ) ,\n\n(9)\n\n(0)\n\nII. FORMALISM\n\nThe energy shift of a bound electron due to the first-order\nself-energy correction is given by the real part of the expression\nZ \u221e\nZ\n\u2206E = 2 i \u03b1\nd\u03c9 dx1 dx2 D\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c9, x12 )\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2020\n\u00d7\u03c8a (x1 ) \u03b1\u03bc\n\n\u2212\u03b4m\n\nZ\n\nC\n\nG(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03c9, x1 , x2 ) \u03b1\u03bd \u03c8a (x2 )\n\ndx \u03c8a\u2020 (x) \u03b2 \u03c8a (x) ,\n\nwhere q = p1 \u2212 p2 , \u03c8 a (p) = \u03c8a\u2020 (p) \u03b3 0 , and \u03a3R (p) and\n\u0393\u03bcR (p1 , p2 ) are the renormalized free self-energy and vertex\nfunctions (for their exact definition and calculational formulas\nsee, e.g., Ref. [19]).\nThe many-potential term is represented by the following expression\nZ\nZ\nd\u03c9 dx1 dx2 D\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c9, x12 )\n\u2206Emany = 2 i \u03b1\n\n(3)\n\n\u00d7 \u03c8a\u2020 (x1 ) \u03b1\u03bc G(2+) (\u03b5a \u2212 \u03c9, x1 , x2 ) \u03b1\u03bd \u03c8a (x2 ) ,\n(10)\n\n\f3\nwhere G(2+) = G \u2212 G(0) \u2212 G(1) and the contour C of the\n\u03c9 integration does not necessarily go along the real axis but\ncan be chosen differently in order to simplify the numerical\nevaluation of this expression. In our approach, we employ the\ncontour CLH that consists of the low-energy part (CL ) and the\nhigh-energy part (CH ) and is similar to the one introduced in\nour previous work [19]. The low-energy part of the contour\nCL extends from \u2212\u03b50 \u2212 i0 to \u2212i0 on the lower bank of the\nbranch cut of the photon propagator and from +i0 to \u03b50 + i0\non the upper bank of the cut. In order to avoid appearance of\npoles of the electron propagator near the integration contour,\neach part of CL is bent into the complex plane if the calculation is performed for excited states. (The analytical structure\nof the integrand and a possible choice of the contour are discussed in Ref. [19].) The high-energy part of the contour is\nCH = (\u03b50 \u2212 i\u221e, \u03b50 \u2212 i0] + [\u03b50 + i0, \u03b50 + i\u221e). The parameter\n\u03b50 separating the low- and the high-energy part of the contour\nis chosen to be \u03b50 = Z\u03b1 \u03b5a in this work. (It is assumed that\nthe condition \u03b5a \u2212 \u03b51s < \u03b50 is fulfilled for the states under\nconsideration, where \u03b51s is the ground-state energy.)\nDue to a lack of a closed-form representation for the Dirac\n\nCoulomb Green function, the evaluation of the many-potential\nterm has to be performed by expanding G (and, therefore,\nG(2+) ) into eigenfunctions of the Dirac angular momentum\nwith the eigenvalue \u03ba. As discussed in Introduction, the convergence rate of the resulting partial-wave expansion is of crucial importance for the numerical evaluation of the self-energy\ncorrection.\nUntil this moment, our description closely followed the\nstandard potential-expansion method [15]. We would like\nnow to modify this method in order to achieve a better convergence of the partial-wave expansion in the many-potential\nterm \u2206Emany . To this end, we look for an approximation\n(2+)\nGa to the function G(2+) that fulfills the following requirements: (i) it can be evaluated in a closed form (i.e., without the\n(2+)\npartial-wave expansion) and (ii) the difference G(2+) \u2212 Ga\ninserted into Eq. (10) yields a rapidly converging partial-wave\nseries.\nWe start with the expansion of the bound-electron Green\nfunction in terms of the binding potential,\n\nZ\nG(E, x1 , x2 ) = G(0) (E, x1 , x2 ) + dz G(0) (E, x1 , z) V (z) G(0) (E, z, x2 )\nZ\n+ dz1 dz2 G(0) (E, x1 , z1 ) V (z1 ) G(0) (E, z1 , z2 ) V (z2 ) G(0) (E, z2 , x2 ) + . . . .\n\nIt is well known that the dominant contribution to radial integrals like those that appear in Eq. (10) originates from the\nregion where the radial arguments are close to each other,\nx1 \u2248 x2 . This region is also responsible for the part of\nthe partial-wave expansion of the Green function that has the\nslowest asymptotic convergence in 1/|\u03ba| [3]. In this region\nthe commutators of the potential V with the free Green function G(0) are small and can be neglected, which corresponds\nto expanding V (z) in a Taylor series around z = x1 (or x2 )\nand keeping only the first term. Commuting V out to the left\nin Eq. (11) and repeatedly employing the identity\nZ\ndz G(0) (E, x1 , z) G(0) (E, z, x2 )\n=\u2212\n\n\u2202\nG(0) (E, x1 , x2 ) ,\n\u2202E\n\n(12)\n\nwe obtain the approximation Ga to the bound-electron Green\nfunction G,\nGa (E, x1 , x2 ) = G(0) (E, x1 , x2 )\n\u2202\n\u2212 V (x1 )\nG(0) (E, x1 , x2 )\n\u2202E\n\u22022\nG(0) (E, x1 , x2 ) + . . . .\n+ V 2 (x1 )\n\u2202E 2\n(13)\n\n(11)\n\nThis expansion has a form of the Taylor series and can be\nformally summed up, yielding\nGa (E, x1 , x2 ) = G(0) (E + \u03a9, x1 , x2 ) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03a9 = \u2212V (x1 ) = Z\u03b1/x1 . Commuting V out to the\nright in Eq. (11), we obtain the same representation for Ga\nbut with \u03a9 = Z\u03b1/x2 .\nIt should be noted that the idea of commuting the potential V outside in the one-potential term was first proposed\nby Mohr [3], who proved that this procedure does not influence the asymptotic ultraviolet behavior of this term (we\nrecall that ultraviolet divergences originate from the region\nx1 \u2248 x2 in configuration space). Later, it was also demonstrated [13, 14] that all ultraviolet divergences in the one-loop\nself-energy correction could be identified by isolating several\nfirst terms of the power-series expansion of the potential V\nand the reference-state wave functions \u03c8a around the point\nx1 = x2 .\nExpression (14) yields an approximation for the boundelectron Green function that has a form of the free Green function with a shifted energy argument. Taking into account that\nthe free Green function is known in a closed form [3]\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\u0012\n1\nc\n(0)\n+ 2 i \u03b1 * x12 + \u03b2 + E\nG (E, x1 , x2 ) = \u2212\nx12\nx12\nexp[\u2212c x12 ]\n,\n(15)\n\u00d7\n4\u03c0x12\n\n\f4\n\u221a\n(c = 1 \u2212 E 2 ), we can employ this expression for the evaluation of Ga .\nAn analogous to Eq. (14) approximation for the function\nG(2+) is obtained by subtracting the first two terms of the Taylor expansion from Ga ,\nG(2+)\n(E, x1 , x2 )\na\n\n(0)\n\nsub\n\u2206Emany\n\n(E + \u03a9, x1 , x2 ) \u2212 G (E, x1 , x2 )\n\u2202\n\u2212\u03a9\nG(0) (E, x1 , x2 ) .\n(16)\n\u2202E\n\nAccording to the derivation, the functions Ga (E, x1 , x2 )\n(2+)\nand Ga (E, x1 , x2 ) approximate,\ncorrespondingly,\nG(E, x1 , x2 ) and G(2+) (E, x1 , x2 ) in the region where\nx1 \u2248 x2 . This means, in particular, that instead of the\noriginal expression for \u03a9 in Eq. (14), \u03a9 = Z\u03b1/x1 , one can\nuse its arbitrary symmetrization with respect to x1 and x2 .\nIn our actual calculations, the following choice of \u03a9 was\nemployed\n2Z\u03b1\n,\nx1 + x2\n\nsub\nremd\n\u2206Emany = \u2206Emany\n+ \u2206Emany\n.\n\n(18)\n\nThe subtraction term is obtained from the high-energy part\n(2+)\nof Eq. (10) by the substitution G(2+) \u2192 Ga . Its explicit\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\n\nZ\n\ndx1 dx2\n\nCH\n\u03b1\u03bc G(2+)\n(\u03b5a\na\n\nexp(i |\u03c9| x12 ) \u2020\n\u03c8a (x1 )\nx12\n\n\u2212 \u03c9, x1 , x2 ) \u03b1\u03bc \u03c8a (x2 ) . (19)\n\nThe remainder term is obtained from Eq. (10) by applying the\n(2+)\nsubstitution G(2+) \u2192 G(2+) \u2212 Ga in the high-energy part.\nremd\nCalculational formulas for the remainder term \u2206Emany\nare\nobtained by obvious modifications of the corresponding expressions for the many-potential term that can be found, e.g.,\nin Ref. [19]. In order to obtain the subtraction term in a form\nsuitable for the numerical evaluation, one has first to perform\nthe angular part of integrations over x1 , x2 analytically. To\n(2+)\ndo so, we utilize the fact that both Ga\nand the scalar part\nof the photon propagator depend on angular variables through\nx12 only. Their product can be written as\nexp(i |\u03c9| x12 )\nx12\n= F1 i \u03b1 * x12 + F2 \u03b2 + F3 .\n\n(17)\n\nwhich turned out to be more convenient from the numerical\npoint of view.\nWe now use the approximate expression for the Green function obtained above in order to separate the many-potential\n(2+)\nterm (10) into two parts, one of which contains Ga\nin(2+)\nstead of G\nand is evaluated in a closed form in configuration space, whereas the remainder is calculated by summing a\nrapidly-converging partial-wave series. Bearing in mind that\nthe partial-wave expansion for the low-energy part of Eq. (10)\nis already converging very fast (if the parameter \u03b50 of the integration contour CLH is chosen as described above), we apply this separation to the high-energy part only. The manypotential term is thus written as a sum of the subtraction and\nthe remainder term,\n\ni\u03b1\n=\n2\u03c0\n\u00d7\n\n(0)\n\n=G\n\n\u03a9=\n\nexpression in the Feynman gauge reads\n\n(\u03b5a \u2212 \u03c9, x1 , x2 )\nG(2+)\na\n\nHere, Fi \u2261 Fi (\u03c9, x1 , x2 , \u03be) are scalar functions depending\non the radial variables through x1 , x2 , and \u03be = x\u03021 * x\u03022 only,\nwhere x\u0302 = x/x. Explicit expressions for Fi are immediately\n(2+)\nobtained from the definition of Ga\n(16) and the expression\n(0)\nfor the free Green function G (15). The functions Fi can\nbe expanded over the set of spherical harmonics by\nFi (\u03c9, x1 , x2 , \u03be) = 4\u03c0\n\nX\n\n(i)\n\n\u2217\nVl (\u03c9, x1 , x2 ) Ylm (x\u03021 ) Ylm\n(x\u03022 ) ,\n\nl, m\n\n(21)\nwhere\n(i)\n\nVl (\u03c9, x1 , x2 ) =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u03be Fi (\u03c9, x1 , x2 , \u03be) Pl (\u03be)\n\n(22)\n\nand Pl (\u03be) is a Legendre polynomial.\n\nSubstituting Eq.

The integration over \u03c9\nin Eq. (23) can be carried out analytically in terms of the exponential integral function, as described in Appendix A, leaving\n\n(20)\n\n(23)\n\na 3-dimensional integration over the radial variables to be performed numerically.\n\n\f5\nIII. NUMERICAL EVALUATION\n\nThe numerical evaluation of the self-energy correction\nwithin the present scheme is in many respects similar to\nthat in the standard potential-expansion approach. Since the\npotential-expansion method is well documented (see, e.g., a\ndetailed description in Ref. [19]), here we concentrate on\nnovel features of our evaluation as compared to the standard\napproach. They appear in the calculations of (i) the highremd\nenergy part of the many-potential remainder term \u2206Emany\nsub\nand (ii) the many-potential subtraction term \u2206Emany .\nThe radial integrations over x1 and x2 in the remainder\nremd\nterm \u2206Emany\nare performed after the change of variables\n(x1 , x2 ) \u2192 (r, y) [4]:\np\nr = min(x1 , x2 )/max(x1 , x2 ) , y = 2 1 \u2212 \u03b5a2 x2 . (24)\nNumerical evaluation of the radial integrals is complicated\n[specifically, for small values of Re(\u03c9)] by the presence of\nthe function G(0) (E + \u03a9) in the integrand. To explain this,\n(0)\nwe recall that the analytical behavior\np of G (E + \u03a9) is\n\u2032\ngoverned by the parameter c =\n1 \u2212 (E + \u03a9)2 . Since\nE \u2261 \u03b5a \u2212 \u03c9 = \u03b5a \u2212 \u03b50 \u2212 iw in the high-energy part (w \u2208 R),\nthe energy argument is\nE + \u03a9 = \u03b5a \u2212 \u03b50 \u2212 iw +\n\n2Z\u03b1\n.\nx1 + x2\n\n(25)\n\nFor certain values of x1 and x2 , Re (E + \u03a9) = 1. When\nw\np is small, a fast change of the phase of the square root\n1 \u2212 (E + \u03a9)2 occurs in the vicinity of this point, which\ncan lead to a numerical instability of the radial integrations.\nThis problem was handled by breaking the integration interval at the point where Re (E + \u03a9) = 1 and employing a larger\nnumber of integration points in this region.\nsub\nThe numerical evaluation of the subtraction term \u2206Emany\nconsists of a 3-dimensional integration over the radial variables, which has a structure of the standard two-electron integral,\nJ=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndx1 dx2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u03be\n\n(x1 x2 )2\nf (x1 , x2 , \u03be) ,\nx12\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the function f has a finite limit for x12 \u2192 0. The integrable singularity in this expression is removed by employing\nthe perimetric coordinates [38],\nu = x1 + x2 \u2212 x12 ,\nv = x1 \u2212 x2 + x12 ,\nw = \u2212x1 + x2 + x12 .\nIn the new variables, the integral J is\nZ\n1 \u221e\ndu dv dw x1 x2 f (x1 , x2 , \u03be) .\nJ=\n4 0\n\n(27a)\n(27b)\n(27c)\n\n(28)\n\nPerforming the integrations in this expression numerically,\none should have in mind that the function f contains a square\n\nroot, whose argument changes its sign for certain combinations of the radial variables, similarly to the case described for\nremd\nthe remainder term \u2206Emany\n. The point at which the argument\nof the square root vanishes is\n\u03b5a \u2212 \u03b50 +\n\n2Z\u03b1\n= 1.\nx1 + x2\n\n(29)\n\nThis feature was taken into account by breaking the integration intervals at the singular point and by employing a larger\nnumber of integration points in its vicinity.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn Tables I, II, and III we present a comparison of two\ndifferent schemes for the evaluation of the self-energy correction for the 1s, 2s, and 2p1/2 states. The labels \"A\" and\n\"B\" stand for the subtraction scheme introduced in this work\nand for the standard potential-expansion approach, respectively. The entry \"Free\" denotes the sum of the zero- and\none-potential terms (this part is the same in both methods),\n\"Subtraction\" stands for the many-potential subtraction term\nsub\n\u2206Emany\n(absent in the standard approach), whereas the individual partial-wave expansion contributions correspond to\nremd\nthe many-potential remainder term \u2206Emany\nand to the manypotential term \u2206Emany in the \"A\" and \"B\" schemes, respectively. The entry \"Behavior\" indicates the approximate dependence of the terms of the partial-wave expansion on |\u03ba| in the\nregion of interest, i.e., for |\u03ba| = 10 \u2212 30. The numbers in\nparentheses represent the uncertainties in the last digit. If no\nuncertainties are indicated, numerical values are believed to\nbe accurate to all digits specified. Our results obtained within\nthe two approaches are compared with the numerical values\nby Mohr [6].\nThe comparison of the data listed in the tables demonstrates\nthat the additional subtraction introduced in this work leads\nto a significant improvement of the convergence properties of\nthe partial-wave expansion in all the cases studied. It also\nindicates that the new approach is applicable for the evaluation\nof the self-energy correction in the low-Z region, where the\nstandard potential-expansion approach fails to yield accurate\nresults.\nIn the low-Z region, one has to deal with numerical cancellations between individual contributions to the self-energy\ncorrection. The origin of these cancellations are spurious\nterms of order \u03b1(Z\u03b1)2 ln Z\u03b1 that appear in the Feynman\ngauge when the self-energy correction is separated into the\nzero, one, and many-potential terms [15] and that have to be\ncancelled numerically in order to obtain the physical contribution to order \u03b1(Z\u03b1)4 . In our approach, the numerical integrations can be relatively easily performed up to a sufficient\naccuracy, so that the numerical cancellations do not pose any\nserious problems. Even in the most difficult case, Z = 1, the\npresent numerical scheme yields a result with a reasonable accuracy, F1s (1\u03b1) = 10.316 85(10), which is in a good agreement with the most precise value by Jentschura et al. [11],\nF1s (1\u03b1) = 10.316 793 650(1).\n\n\f6\nIn Table IV we present the numerical results for the selfenergy correction in the region that was not previously tabulated in the literature, 5 < Z < 10, and compare our numerical values for Z = 5 and 10 with evaluations by other\nauthors. It is noteworthy that unlike the previous calculations\nsummarized in Table IV, our evaluation is computationally\nvery cheap. The time of the calculation for one value of Z\nis less than 1h on a modern personal computer. This feature\nmakes the present approach very promising for extensions to\nthe higher-order self-energy corrections.\nTo sum up, we have developed a highly efficient scheme for\nthe evaluation of the one-loop self-energy correction for an\nelectron bound in a symmetric local potential (not necessarily\nthe Coulomb one). The approach presented inherits the attractive features of the standard potential-expansion method but\nyields a much better convergence rate for the resulting partialwave expansion. As a result, the applicability of the potentialexpansion method is extended into the region of large values\nof the parameter n3 /(Z\u03b1)2 . We expect that the approach developed will allow one to significantly improve accuracy of\nevaluations of the self-energy correction to the hyperfine splitting and of the screened self-energy correction in the low-Z\nregion and could be also applied for higher-order self-energy\ncorrections.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by NATO (Grant\nNo. PST.CLG.979624) and by RFBR (Grant No. 04-0217574).
