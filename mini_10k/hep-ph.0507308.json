Most physical phenomena could be explained with this physics. Black body spectrum, however,\ncould not be explained by the physics of that time, leading Planck to propose a quantization postulate to solve this problem [1]. The Planck postulate eventually led to quantum\nmechanics. Physicists already clearly knew that the black body spectrum was a new\nphenomenon outside the applicable area of classic physics. The development from clas1\n\n\fsic physics to quantum physics depended mainly on new physical ideas (a quantization\npostulate) rather than complex mathematics and extra dimensions of space.\nToday we face a similar situation. The standard model [2] \"is in excellent accord with\nalmost all current data.... It has been enormously successful in predicting a wide range\nof phenomena,\" but it cannot deduce the mass spectra of quarks. So far, no theory has\nbeen able to successfully do so. Like black body spectrum, this mass spectrum may need\na new theory outside the standard model. M. K. Gaillard, P. D. Grannis, and F. J Sciulli\nhave already pointed out [2] that the standard model \"is incomplete... We do not expect\nthe standard model to be valid at arbitrarily short distances. However, its remarkable\nsuccess strongly suggest that the standard model will remain an excellent approximation\nto nature at distance scales as small as 10\u221218 m... high degree of arbitrariness suggests\nthat a more fundamental theory underlies the standard model.\" The mass spectrum of\nquarks is outside the applicable area of the standard model. Physicists need to find a\nnew and more fundamental theory that underlies the standard model. The history of\nquantum physics shows that a new physics theory's primary need is new physical ideas.\nA three step quantization is the new physical idea. Using this quantization, we try to\ndeduce the masses of quarks.\nToday, physics' foundation is quantum physics (quantum mechanics and quantum\nfield theory), not classic physics. We work with quantum systems (quarks and hadrons)\nthat are a level deeper than the system (atoms and molecules) faced by Planck and\nBohr. Therefore, the quantized systems are quantum systems (not the classic system).\nIf Planck and Bohr got correct quantizations for atoms and molecules using only one\nsimple quantization, we must use more steps and more complex quantizations. It is\nworth emphasizing that deducing the rest masses and the intrinsic quantum numbers of\nthe quarks using the three step quantization may be one level deeper than the standard\nmodel. Hopefully, the three step quantization can help physicists discover a more fundamental theory underlying the standard model [2], just as the Planck-Bohr quantization\n2\n\n\fdid.\n\n2. The elementary quarks and their free excited quarks\n\n2.1 The elementary quarks\n\nWe assume that there is only one elementary quark family \u01eb with s = I =\ntwo isospin states (\u01ebu has IZ =\n\n1\n2\n\nand Q = + 32 , \u01ebd has IZ =\n\n\u22121\n2\n\n1\n2\n\nand\n\nand Q = - 13 ). For \u01ebu\n\n(or \u01ebd ), there are three colored (red, yellow and blue) quarks. Thus, there are six Fermi\nelementary quarks in the \u01eb family with S = C = B = 0 in the vacuum. \u01ebu and \u01ebd have\nSU(2) symmetry.\nAs a colored (red, yellow or blue) elementary quark \u01ebu (or \u01ebd ) is excited from the\nvacuum, its color, electric charge, rest mass and spin do not change, but it will get\nenergy. The free excited state of the elementary quark \u01ebu is the u-quark with either a\nred, yellow or blue color, Q = 32 , rest mass m\u2217\u01ebu , I = s =\n\n1\n2\n\nand Iz =\n\n1\n2\n\n. The free excited\n\nstate of the elementary quark \u01ebd is the d-quark with either a red, yellow or blue color,\nQ = - 13 , rest mass m\u2217\u01ebd , I = s =\n\n1\n2\n\nand Iz = - 12 . Since \u01ebu and \u01ebd have SU(2) symmetry,\n\nthe u-quark and the d-quark also have SU(2) symmetry.\n\n2..2 The free motion of excited quark\n\nFor the excited quark free motion, we generally use the Dirac equation,\ni\u0127\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8 \u0127c\n= (\u03b11 1 +\u03b12 2 +\u03b13 3 ) + \u03b2m\u2217\u01eb C2 \u03c8.\n\u2202t i\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(1)\n\nOur purpose, however, is to find rest masses of the excited quarks. The rest masses are\nthe energy of the excited quark at rest. Corresponding to an excited quark at rest, the\n\n3\n\n\ffree motion Dirac equation (1) reduces [3] to\ni\u0127\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n= \u03b2m\u2217\u01eb c2 \u03c8.\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\nThe equation has four solutions:\n\uf8ee\n1\n\n2\n\n\u2212i mc\nt\n\u0127\n\n\u03c8 =e\n\n1\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\n2 \uf8ef\n2 \uf8ef\n2 \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0 \uf8fa 2\n\uf8ef \uf8fa , \u03c8 = e\u2212i mc\u0127 t \uf8ef 1 \uf8fa , \u03c8 3 = e+i mc\u0127 t \uf8ef 0 \uf8fa , \u03c8 1 = e+i mc\u0127 t \uf8ef 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef 1 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n\uf8f0 \uf8fb\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n\u03c8 1 and \u03c8 2 correspond to positive energy (quark) and \u03c8 3 and \u03c8 4 correspond to negative\nenergy (antiquark). If we only consider quark and omit antiquark, we can get the twocomponent Pauli equation. Bjorken and Drell wrote [3]: \"In particular, we wish to show\nthat they have a sensible nonrelativistic reduction to the two-component Pauli spin\ntheory.\" Thus we can use the low energy limit of the Dirac equation\u2013 Pauli equation to\nfind the rest masses of quarks.\nFor single quark free low energy motion, the quark with spin up (sz = 21 ) will have\nthe same energy as the same quark with spin down (sz = - 12 ). Thus, for single free low\nenergy limits, we can omit the spin of the quark, and the two-component Pauli equation\ncan be approached by the Schr\u00f6dinger [4] equation. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is not to\nbe looked down on. In fact, it is useful in deducing the rest masses of some baryons [5]\nand \"quarkonium\" mesons cc and bb [6] and [7].\nWhen we use the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to approach the Pauli equation, we cannot\nforget the static energy of the excited quark. We will deal with this energy as a constant\npotential energy (V) at any location. The approximate Schr\u00f6dinger equation is:\n\n\u01272 2\n\u2207 \u03c8 + (E-V)\u03c8 = 0\n2m\u2217\u01eb\n\n(3)\n\n4\n\n\fwhere m\u2217\u01eb is the unknown rest mass of the excited quark. V is the static energy (constant), and it is the minimum excited energy of an elementary quark from the vacuum.\nThe solution of (3) is the eigen wave function and the eigen energy of the free u-quark\nor the free d-quark:\n\u2192 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192 ( r ) \u223d exp(i k * r ),\neigen function \u03c8 \u2212\nk\n2\n\n2\n2\n2\n\u0127\neigen energy E = V + 2m\n\u2217 [(k1 ) +(k2 ) +(k3 ) ].\n\n(4)\n\n\u01eb\n\nAccording to the Quark Model [8] a proton p = uud and a neutron n = udd. Omitting\n\u2192\n\u2212\nelectromagnetic mass of quarks, from (4), at k = 0, we have the rest masses\n\nMp = m\u2217u +m\u2217u +m\u2217d - |Ebind | \u2248 Mn = m\u2217u +m\u2217d +m\u2217d - |Ebind | = 939 Mev\n\u2192 m\u2217u = m\u2217d = V =\n\n1\n(939 + |Ebind | ) = 313 +\u2206 (Mev)\n3\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere Ebind is the total binding energy of the three quarks in a baryon. \u2206 represents\n1\n3\n\n|Ebind |, and is an unknown large positive constant. Since no free quark has been found,\n\nwe assume\n\u2206=\n\n1\n|Ebind | >> Mp .\n3\n\n(7)\n\nThe free excited u(313+\u2206)-quark and d(313+\u2206)-quark have large rest masses (313+\u2206)\n>> Mp = 938 Mev. This is a reason that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the low energy free\nquark is a good approximation of the Dirac equation. The large rest masses of excited\nquarks guarantee that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a very good approximation.\nNow we deduce the energy bands (quarks) with a three step quantization method.\n\n3 Deducing energy bands with a three step Quantization\n\n5\n\n\fToday's physics must continue to develop from the standard model into a more\nfundamental physics [2]. The new theory will deduce the rest masses and intrinsic\nquantum numbers (I, S, C, B and Q) of the quarks. Recall that the development from\nclassic physics to quantum physics began with the Planck-Bohr quantization. We try to\nuse a three step quantization method to start the long time procedure.\n\n3.1 Recall Planck and Bohr's works\n\nPlanck's [1] energy quantization postulate states that \"any physical entity whose\nsingle 'coordinate' execute simple harmonic oscillations (i.e., is a sinusoidal function of\ntime) can possess only total energy \u03b5 which satisfy the relation \u03b5 = nh\u03bd, n = 0, 1, 2,\n3, .... where \u03bd is the frequency of the oscillation and h is a universal constant.\" Planck\nselects reasonable energy from a continuous energy spectrum.\nBohr's [9] orbit quantization tells us that \"an electron in an atom moves in a circular\norbit about the nucleus...obeying the laws of classical mechanics. But instead of the\ninfinity of orbits which would be possible in classical mechanics, it is only possible for\nan electron to move in an orbit for which its orbital angular momentum L is an integral\nmultiple of Planck's constant h, divided by 2\u03c0.\" Using the quantization condition (L =\nnh\n,\n2\u03c0\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, ... ), Bohr selects reasonable orbits from infinite orbits.\nDrawing from these great physicists' works, we find that the most important law\n\nis to use quantized conditions and symmetries (as circular orbit) to select reasonable\nenergy levels from a continuous energy spectrum.\n\n3.2 Three step Quantization\n\nIn order to get the short-lived quarks, we quantize the free motion (quantum plane\nwave function of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation) of an excited quark (4) to select energy bands\n6\n\n\ffrom the continuous energy. The energy bands will correspond to short-lived quarks.\n\n3.2.1 The first step quantizing condition\n\nFor free motion of an excited quark with continuous energy (4), we assume the wave\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2212\nvector k has the symmetries of the regular rhombic dodecahedron in k -space (see Fig.\n1).\n\nWe assume that the axis \u0393-H in Fig.1 has length\n\n2\u03c0\na\n\nwith an unknown constant a.\n\nThe first step quantizing conditions are:\nk1 =\nk2 =\nk3 =\n\n2\u03c0\n(n1 -\u03be),\na\n2\u03c0\n(n2 -\u03b7),\na\n2\u03c0\n(n3 -\u03b6).\na\n\n(8)\n\nPutting (8) into (4), we get (9) and (10):\n\n2\u03c0i\n[(n1 -\u03be)x + (n2 - \u03b7)y+(n3 - \u03b6)z],\na\n= 313 + \u2206 + \u03b1[(n1 -\u03be)2 +(n2 -\u03b7)2 +(n3 -\u03b6)2 ]\n\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192( r )\n\u03c8\u2212\nk\n\n\u2248\n\nE(~k,~n)\n\nexp\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n= 313 + \u2206 + 360 E(\u2212\n\u03ba ,\u2212\nn ) (Mev).\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n2\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nwhere \u03b1 = 2mh\u2217 a2 = 360 Mev (29). E(\u2212\n\u03ba ,\u2212\nn ) = [(n1 -\u03be)2 +(n2 -\u03b7)2 +(n3 -\u03b6)2 ]. For \u2212\nn = (n1 ,\n\u01eb\n\u2192\nn , n ), n , n and n are \u00b1 integers and zero.

In order to deduce the short-lived quarks, we must\n\u2192\n\u2192\nfurther quantize the \u2212\nn and \u2212\n\u03ba as follows.\n7\n\n\f3.2.2 The second step quantization\n\u2212\nWe will quantize the \u2192\nn = (n1 , n2 , n3 ) values further. If we assume n1 = l 2 + l 3 , n2\n= l 3 + l 1 and n3 = l 1 + l 2 , so that\nl 1 = 21 (-n1 + n2 + n3 )\nl 2 = 21 (+n1 - n2 + n3 )\n\n(11)\n\nl 3 = 21 (+n1 + n2 - n3 ).\n\u2192\nThe second step quantizing condition is that only those values of \u2212\nn = (n1 , n2 , n3 ) are\n\u2192\n\u2212\nallowed that make l = (l 1 , l 2 , l 3 ) an integer vector. This is a second step quantization\nfor ~n values. For example, ~n cannot take the values (1, 0, 0) or (1, 1, -1), but can take\n\u2192\n\u2192\n(0, 0, 2) and (1, -1, 2). From E(\u2212\n\u03ba ,\u2212\nn ) = [(n1 -\u03be)2 +(n2 -\u03b7)2 +(n3 -\u03b6)2 ], we can give a\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\ndefinition of the equivalent \u2192\nn : for \u2192\n\u03ba = (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03c2) = 0, all \u2192\nn values that give the same\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2212\nE(\u2212\n\u03ba ,\u2212\nn ) value are equivalent n-values.

From (10),\n(29) and (28), the rest mass (m\u2217 ) of the quark is\nm\u2217 = {313+ 360 minimum[(n1 -\u03be)2 +(n2 -\u03b7)2 +(n3 -\u03b6)2 ]+\u2206E+\u2206} (Mev)\n= m + \u2206 (Mev),\n\n(30)\n\nThis formula (30) is the united quark mass formula.\nUsing above phenomenological formulae, we will show that each energy band corresponds to a short-lived quark and deduce its intrinsic quantum numbers I, S, C, B and\nQ. The minimum energy of the energy band is the rest mass of the short-lived quark\ncorresponding to the energy band.\n\n5 Deducing quarks using the phenomenological formulae from energy\nbands\n\n5.1 Deducing quarks from the energy bands in Tables 1 and 2\n13\n\n\fFrom deduced single energy bands of the \u2206-axis in Table 1, we can use the above\nformulae (17)-(30) to deduce the quarks. For the \u2206-axis, R = 4, strange number S\u2206 =\n0 from (18). For single energy bands, I = 0 from (17); and S = S\u2206 + \u2206S = \u2206S = \u03b4(e\nn) \u2212\nSign(e\nn) from (19). For \u2192\nn = (0, 0, -2) and (0, 0, -4), \u2206S = +1 from (20) and (19); for\nn = (0, 0, 2), (0, 0, 4) and (0, 0, 6) \u2206S = -1 from (20) and (19). Using (24), (20) and\n(19), we can find the charmed number C = +1 when n = (0, 0, -2) and (0, 0, -4). From\n(26), we can find Q =\n\n2\n3\n\nwhen n = (0, 0, -2) and (0, 0, -4); from (27), Q = -\n\n1\n3\n\nwhen\n\nn = (0, 0, 2), (0, 0, 4) and (0, 0, 6). From (28) and (30), we can find the rest masses\n(minimE + \u2206E) . We list all results in Table 3:\nTable 3.

The strange quarks ds (493), ds (773), ds (1933), dS (3753)\nds (9613), d\u03a9 (1033+\u2206), d\u03a9 (3193+\u2206) and d\u03a9 (6493+\u2206); The ground strange quark is ds (493).\nThe charmed quarks uc (1753) and uc (6073); the charmed ground quark is uc (1753). The\nbottom quarks db (4913) and db (9333); the bottom ground quark is db (4913). (in Table\n11 of [10] we have shown all low energy quarks, the five deduced ground quarks are still\nthe ground quarks of all quarks). For the four flavored quarks, there are five ground\nquarks [u(313+\u2206), d(313+\u2206), dS (493+\u2206), uC (1753+\u2206) and db (4913+\u2206)] in the quark\nspectrum. These five ground quarks correspond to the five quarks [11] of the current\nQuark Model: u \u2194 u(313+\u2206), d \u2194 d(313+\u2206), s \u2194 dS (493+\u2206), c \u2194 uC (1753+\u2206) and\nb \u2194 db (4913+\u2206).\nWe can compare the rest masses and intrinsic quantum numbers (I, S, C, b and\nQ) [11] of the current quarks with the deduced values of the five ground quarks.

If we\nuse the same energy reference system, the deduced masses of ground quarks will be\nroughly consistent with the masses of the corresponding current quarks. Of course, the\nultimate test is whether or not the baryons and mesons composed of the deduced quarks\nare consistent with experimental results.\nWe will deduce the baryons and mesons composed of the quarks in Table 3 and 4 in\nthis paper.\n\n16\n\n\f6 Deducing the baryons of the quarks in Table 3 and 4\n\nAccording to the Quark Model [8], a colorless baryon is composed of three different\ncolored quarks. Using sum laws (31) and the deduced quarks in Tables 3 and 4, we can\ndeduce the baryons as shown in Table 6. From Tables 3 and 4, we can see that there\nis a term \u2206 of the rest masses of quarks. \u2206 is a very large unknown constant. Since\nthe rest masses of the quarks in a baryon are large (from \u2206) and the rest mass of the\nbaryon composed by three quarks is not, we infer that there will be a strong binding\nenergy (EBind = - 3\u2206) to cancel 3\u2206 from the three quarks: MB = m\u2217q1 + m\u2217q\n\nN (313)\n\nm\u2217q\n\nN (313)\n\n- |EBind | = mq1 + mqN (313) + mq\n\nN (313)\n\n+ 3\u2206 - 3\u2206 = mq1 + mqN (313) + mq\n\nN (313)\n\n+\n\n. Thus\n\nwe will omit the term 3\u2206 in the three quark masses and the term \u22123\u2206 in the binding\nenergy from now on. For simplicity's sake, we only deduced baryons composed of at least\ntwo free excited quark qN (313) [u(313), d(313)] since other baryons have much lower\nproductivity. For these baryons, sum laws are:\n\nBaryon strange number SB = Sq1 + SqN (313) + SqN (313) = Sq1 ,\nbaryon charmed number CB = Cq1 + CqN (313) + CqN (313) = Cq1 ,\nbaryon bottom number BB = Bq1 + BqN (313) + BqN (313) = Bq1 ,\nbaryon electric charge QB = Qq1 + Qq\n\nN (313)\n\nbaryon mass MB = mq1 + mqN (313) + mq\n\n+ Qq\n\nN (313)\n\nFor charmed baryons, MB = mq1 + mqN (313) + mq\n\nN (313)\n\n.\n\n(except charmed baryons)\n\nN (313)\n\n\u2206e = 100C(2I-1)\n\n(31)\n\n+ \u2206e\n(32)\n\nwhere C is the charmed number and I is the isospin of the charmed baryons.

These\nare strong supports for the deduced the rest masses and intrinsic quantum numbers of\nthe quarks.\n\n7 Deducing the mesons of the quarks in Tables 3 and 4\n\nAccording to the Quark Model [8], a colorless meson is composed of a quark qi with\na color and an antiquark qj with the anticolor of the quark qi . For each flavor, the three\ndifferent colored quarks have the same I, S, C, B, Q and m. Thus we can omit the color\nwhen we deduce the rest masses and intrinsic quantum numbers of the mesons. For\n18\n\n\fmesons, the sum laws are\n\nMeson strange number SM = Sqi + Sqj ,\nmeson charmed numbers CM = Cqi + Cqj ,\n\n(33)\n\nmeson bottom number BM = Bqi + Bqj ,\nmeson electric charge QM = Qqi + Qqj .\n\nThere is a strong interaction between the quark and antiquark (colors), but we do not\nknow how large it is. Since the rest masses of the quarks in mesons are large (from \u2206)\nand the rest mass of the meson composed of the quark and antiquark is not, we infer\nthat there will be a large portion of binding energy (- 2\u2206) to cancel 2\u2206 from the quark\nand antiquark and a small amount of binding energy as shown in the following\nEB (qi qj ) = -2\u2206 - 337 + 100[\nwhere \u2206 = 31 |Ebind | (7) is\n\n1\n3\n\n\u2206m\n+DS - m+\u03b3(i,j)\ne\n-2Ii Ij ]\nmg\n\n(34)\n\nof the binding energy of a baryon (an unknown large constant,\n\n\u2206 >> mP = 938 Mev), \u2206m = |mi -mj |, DS = (\u2206S)i - (\u2206S)j . mg = 939 (Mev) unless\nmi (or mj ) equals\nmg will equal to\nm\ne =\n\nmi \u00d7mj\nmgi \u00d7mgj\n\nmC > 6073\n\nmb > 9333\n\nmS > 9613\n\n1753(Table 4) 4913 (Table7)\n\n3753(Table 4).\n\n(35)\n\nmgi = mgj = 939 (Mev) unless\n\nmi (or mj )\n\nmqN =313 mds =493 muc \u00171753 mdS > 3753, mdb \u0017 4913\n\nmgj (or mgj )\n\n313\n\n493\n\n1753\n\n3753,\n\n4913.\n\n(36)\n\nIf qi and qj are both ground quarks in Table 5, \u03b3(i, j) = 0.

It is well known that the discovery of J/\u03c8(1S) is also the discovery\nof charmed quark c (uc (1753)) and that the discovery of \u03a5(9460) is also the discovery\nof bottom quark b (db (4913)). Similarly the discovery of \u03a5(3S) will be the discovery of\na very important new quark-the uC (6073)-quark.\n\n9 Discussion\n\n1). From the low energy free wave motion of a excited elementary quark \u01eb with\n2\n\n\u0127\na continuous energy spectrum {E = V + 2m\n[(k1 )2 +(k2 )2 +(k3 )2 ]}, using the three step\n\nquantization, we obtain a new energy formula {E(~k,~n) =313 + \u2206 + \u03b1[(n1 -\u03be)2 +(n2 \u03b7)2 +(n3 -\u03b6)2 ]} with quantized ~n values (12) and ~k values (14). The energy (10) with a\n\u2192\n\u2212\nn = (n1 , n2 , n3 ) of (12) and a ~k = (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03c2) of (14) forms an energy band. If the free\neigen wave function and eigen energy of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation are first quantization,\nthe three step quantization is the \"second quantization\". This \"second quantization\"\nproducts new quantum\u2013 shout-lived quarks.\n2). The rest masses and the intrinsic quantum numbers (I, S, C, B and Q) are necessary for the standard model, but they cannot be deduced by the standard model. Using\n(17) - (30), we deduce the rest masses and intrinsic quantum numbers of quarks from the\nenergy bands. The deduced rest masses and quantum numbers of baryons and mesons\nfrom these masses and numbers of quarks, are consistent with experimental results. This\nis a strong support for the three step quantization.\n3). The five quarks of the current Quark Model correspond to the five deduced\nground quarks [u\u2194u(313), d\u2194d(313), s\u2194ds (493), c\u2194uc (1753) and b\u2194db (4913)] (see\nTable 11 of [10])). The current Quark Model uses only these five quarks to explain\nbaryons and mesons. In early times, this was reasonable, natural and useful. Today,\nhowever, it is not reasonable that physicists use only these five current quarks since\nphysicists have discovered many high energy baryons and mesons that are composed of\n22\n\n\fmore high energy quarks.\n\u2192\n4). The energy band excited quarks u(313) with \u2212\nn = (0, 0, 0) in Table 3 and d(313)\n\u2212\nwith \u2192\nn = (0, 0, 0) in Table 4 will be short-lived quarks. They are, however, lowest\nenergy quarks. Since there is no lower energy position that they can decay into, they\nare not short-lived quarks. Because they have the same rest mass and intrinsic quantum\nnumbers as the free excited quarks u(313) and d(313), they cannot be distinguished\nfrom the free excited quarks u(313) and d(313) by experiments. The u(313) and d(313)\n\u2212\nwith \u2192\nn = (0, 0, 0) will be covered up by free excited u(313) and d(313) in experiments.\n\u2212\nTherefore, we can omit u(313) and d(313) with \u2192\nn = (0, 0, 0) since the probability that\nthey are produced much small than the free excited u(313)-quark and d(313)-quark.\nThere are only long-lived and free excited the u(313)-quark and the d(313)-quark in\nboth theory and experiments.\n5). The fact that physicists have not found any free quark shows that the binding\nenergies are very large. The baryon binding energy -3\u2206 (meson - 2\u2206 ) is a phenomenological approximation of the color's strong interaction energy in a baryon (a meson).\nThe binding energy -3\u2206 (-2\u2206) is always cancelled by the corresponding parts 3\u2206 of the\nrest masses of the three quarks in a baryon (2\u2206 of the quark and antiquark in a meson).\nThus we can omit the binding energy -3\u2206 (-2\u2206) and the corresponding rest mass parts\n3\u2206 (2\u2206) of the quarks when we deduce rest masses of baryons (mesons). This effect\nmakes it appear as if there is no strong binding energy in baryons (mesons).\n\n10 Conclusions\n\n1). There is only one elementary quark family \u01eb with three colors and two isospin\nstates (\u01ebu with IZ =\n\n1\n2\n\nand Q = + 23 , \u01ebd with IZ =\n\n\u22121\n2\n\nand Q = - 31 ) for each color. Thus\n\nthere are six Fermi (s = 12 ) elementary quarks with S = C = B = 0 in the vacuum. \u01ebu\nand \u01ebd have SU(2) symmetries.\n23\n\n\f2). All quarks inside hadrons are the excited states of the elementary quark \u01eb. There\nare two types of excited states: free excited states and energy band excited states. The\nfree excited states are only the u-quark and the d-quark. They are long-lived quarks.\nThe energy band excited states are the short-lived quarks, such as ds (493), ds (773),\nuc (1753) and db (4913).\n3). Since all quarks inside hadrons are excited states of the same elementary quark\n\u01eb, all quarks (m > 313 Mev) will eventually decay into the qN (313)-quark [(u(313) and\nd(313)].\n4). The three step quantization is a someway \"second quantization\" that products\nthe short-lived quarks.\n5). There is a large binding energy -3\u2206 (or -2\u2206) among three quarks in a baryon (or\nbetween the quark and the antiquark in a meson). It may be a possible foundation for\nthe quark confinement.\n6). We have deduced the rest masses and intrinsic quantum numbers of quarks (Table\n3 and 4), baryons (Table 6) and mesons (Table 7) using the three step quantization\nmethod and phenomenological formulae. The deduced intrinsic quantum numbers of\nbaryons and mesons match the experimental results [12] and [13] exactly, while the\ndeduced rest masses of the baryons and the mesons are consistent with more than 98%\nof experimental results [12] and [13].\n7). The current Quark Model is the five ground quark approximation of a more\nfundamental model.\n8). This paper predict some new quarks [uC (6073) , db (9333) and dS (773)], baryons\n[\u039bC (6699) and B(9959)] and mesons [D(6231), B(9502) and K(3876)].\n\nAcknowledgments\nI sincerely thank Professor Robert L.
