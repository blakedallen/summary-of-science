This approach is based on the spectrophometric properties of\nstars at, ideally, all evolutionary phases and takes into\naccount all phenomena that largely affect the evolution\nof a star (e.g., mass-loss). Over the years, ever since the\ntechnique was first implemented (Tinsley 1968, 1972),\na wide variety of models based on different ingredients have been constructed and used in the study of\nyoung and old stellar populations (among the most\npopular ones, Buzzoni 1989; Bressan, Chiosi & Fagotto\nMiguel Chavez\nEmanuele Bertone\nInstituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica y Electronica, Luis E.\nErro 1, 72840 Tonantzintla, Puebla, Mexico\n\n1994; Worthey 1994; Bruzual & Charlot 1993, 2003;\nLeitherer et al. 1999; Maraston 2005). Not surprisingly,\nmost of the work done up to date has vastly focused\nin the optical spectrophotometric properties of stellar\nsystems, and until relatively recently it has expanded\nto other wavelengths (as far as the detailed analysis of\nspectral features is concerned), and, in some cases, included the effects of an interstellar medium (Silva et al.\n1998; Panuzzo et al. 2005).\nAt ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, usually divided\ninto two segments, the far-UV (1200\u20132000 \u00c5) and the\nmid-UV (2000\u20133200 \u00c5), the natural systems to look\nat are those whose underlying populations copiously\nemit and have their emission maxima in that window,\ni.e. star-forming systems. While these systems are extremely important in many astrophysical contexts (see,\ne.g., Buzzoni 2002), it was eventually realized that also\nold and intermediate age populations, which will be\nthe main subject in this paper, deserve attention by\ntheir own right. As an example we can mention the\ncountless studies motivated by the unexpected finding\nof a prominent far-UV flux excess in the bulge of Andromeda (Code 1969). Aside of this far-UV flux excess,\nthe mid-UV still remains vastly unexplored, in spite\nof the early suggestions that this wavelength region\ncan help in lifting the so-called age-metallicity degeneracy (AMD) that plagues the optical spectrophotometric\nproperties of evolved populations and that prevents the\nunivocal determination of these parameters (Worthey\n1994; Dorman et al. 2003). Disentangling the effects of\nage and chemical composition is particularly important\nwhen attempting to evaluate the characteristics of distant red objects for which, through optical observations\nonly feasible with the current generation of large telescopes, we can only access the rest-frame mid-UV flux\n(e.g., Dunlop et al. 1996).\nMotivated by these three issues inherent to aged populations, the nature of the far-UV flux, the AMD, and\n\n\f2\n\nthe properties of instrisically red galaxies up to z \u223c 2,\nwe started a project aimed at providing complementary\ntools for their analysis. In what follows, we present\na short (and necessarily incomplete) review of each of\nthe above mentioned topics; we also briefly describe our\nproject and present some preliminary results that are\nstill under investigation.\n\n2 The Far-UV Rising Branch of Elliptical\nGalaxies\nEarly-type stellar systems, such as elliptical galaxies\nand spiral bulges, are sometimes characterized by a\nprominent flux shortward of 2000 \u00c5 (Fig. 1). The nature of this flux excess (also called UV upturn, UVX\nphenomenon or UV rising branch) has been a subject\nof much debate ever since its discovery in the bulge of\nM31 (Code 1969). Soon after this detection, a variety of hypotheses emerged to explain the FUV rising\nflux (see the excellent reviews by Burstein et al. 1988;\nGreggio & Renzini 1990; O'Connell 1999): among\nthem, a non-thermal origin through the galactic nuclear activity, the presence of an unexpected (for longly\nthought quiescent systems) population of hot young\nstars (Tinsley 1972), low-mass metal-rich evolved objects (Bressan, Chiosi & Fagotto 1994; Yi et al. 1997)\nor their metal-poor counterparts (Lee 1994). More recently, it has been analyzed the potential dominant role\nthat subdwarf stars could play in modulating the farUV properties of the host galaxy, either as members\nof binary systems (Han, Podsiadlowski & Lunas-Gray\n2007, 2009) or arising from the evolution of single stellar\nobjects (Napivotski 2008, 2009). A supplemental piece\nof the puzzle has been provided by the detection of multiple main sequences (MSs) in galactic globular clusters,\nwhich reinforces the explanation of UVX phenomenon\nthrough presence of helium-rich sub-populations.\nOver the past four decades evidence has grown in\nfavour of the low-mass star hypotheses. Hills (1971) argued against a non-thermal origin based on the overall\nshape of the far-UV energy distributions, which more\nclosely resembles that of the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of a\nthermal source. Additionally, the diffuse distribution\nof the UV radiation, which can be fitted by a de Vaucouleaurs profile such as the visible light, cannot be explained by the presence of a highly concentrated source,\nas would be expected if an active nucleus is the origin\n(Oke, Bertola & Capaccioli 1981; Ohl et al. 1998). In a\nsimilar way, the UV imaginery has also worked against\nthe residual star formation hypothesis (which would be\nimplied by the presence of hot MS stars) since, within\nthe detection and resolution limits of several experiments, O and B stars have not yet been detected.\n\nFig. 1 Comparison of the mid-UV and far-UV spectral energy distribution of two elliptical galaxies observed with IUE\n(NGC1399 and NGC4649) to illustrate the far-UV excess.\nThe violet and blue curves correspond to the observed spectra, broadened with a Gaussian kernel of 50 \u00c5, and the red\nflux to a 10 Gyr old theoretical spectra of solar metallicity,\ncalculated with the ingredients described in Chavez et al.\n(2009).\n\nWhilst the currently most accepted picture for the\nnature of the far-UV excess is that the bulk of UV radiation is dominated by helium burning low mass stars\nand their progeny, in particular the so-called AGBmanqu\u00e9, the idea of having on going star formation at\nvery low levels has remained as a still plausible elucidation for the UVX phenomenon (Rich et al. 2005; Rich\n2009). This fact might be supported by the prevalence\nof molecular hydrogen (usually traced by the more accessible signatures of carbon monoxide at millimeter\nwavelengths) in early-type systems, although in small\namounts, indicative of star formation with an efficiency\nwhich is in fact similar to that found in spiral aggregates (e.g., Sage, Welch & Young 2007).\n\n3 The Age-Metallicity Degeneracy\nThe optical colors of old populations are affected by\nthe age-metallicity degeneracy (Worthey 1994): it implies that the spectrophotometric properties of an unresolved stellar population can not be distinguished from\nthose of another population three times older and with\nhalf the metal content. As an example, we show, in\nFig. 2, the comparison of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) [calculated using the models of Worthey\n\n\f3\n\n(1994)1 and normalized to the K band] of two simple\nstellar populations with ages and abundances indicated\nin the labels of the figure. In the lower planel, we display the flux residual in magnitudes of the two energy\ndistributions.\nBeing arguably amongst the main parameters of a\nstellar population, there have been a number of studies\naimed at finding the appropiate features(s) that unambiguously separate the effects of age from those of\nmetallicity. In fact, Worthey (1994) conducted a detailed analysis of optical features in the form of spectrocopic indices (the so-called Lick indices) and found\nthat akin the broad band colors, the indices, while partially diminishing the AMD, are also degenerate.\nMore recently, alternative spectral windows have\nbeen proposed as promising tools to lift the AMD. In\nparticular, the rest-frame mid-UV flux and colors (Yi\n2003; Dorman et al. 2003; Kaviraj et al. 2007) has been\ninvestigated on the basis that the UV properties are\ndominated by different stellar types at different evolutionary phases (MS) with respect to those dominating\nthe optical (red giants). The overall results indicate\nthat the UV indeed helps to better constrain the age of\nunresolved systems (as would be expected since the MS\nturn-off are much more sensitive to age than the red giant branch), but the determination of chemical composition was still better determined by the more sensitive\noptical features. The obvious path to further tackle the\nAMD problem was the use of mid-UV spectroscopic indices, however, there was the prevalent concept (somewhat justified, but quantitatively not investigated) that\nthe use of synthetic UV indices at the appropiate resolution was still inadequate for the study of, for example,\nIUE spectra (see brief discussion in Chavez et al. 2007)\nand therefore investigations of absorption indices was\nconducted by using, for instance, Kurucz (1993) low\nresolution grid (e.g., Lotz et al. 2000), which appeared\nmore reliable.\nTo date, the use of mid-UV synthetic indices is still\nin its infancy. Suffice here to mention that the citations to the relevant works where they were defined\n(Fanelli et al. 1990) are outnumbered by a factor of\n15 (!) by the papers referencing the optical indices definition (Worthey et al. 1994), albeit they were defined\nroughly at the same time.\n1 through the on-line application Dial a Galaxy:\nhttp://astro.wsu.edu/worthey/\n\nFig. 2 An example of the age-metallicity degeneracy. In\nthe upper panel we plot the spectral energy distributions\n(normalized to the K band), of two simple stellar populations for the ages and chemical compositions as labeled in\nthe figure. We have used the models of Worthey (1994) for\na Salpeter initial mass function. In the lower panel we display the flux residual in magnitudes of the SEDs. Note that\nwhile the differences are small in the optical interval, in the\nUV the residuals reach up to one magnitude, indicating that\nif the age-metallicity degeneracy is present in the UV it is\nnecessarily different from that in the optical\n\n\f4\n\n4 Distant Red Galaxies\nObservations at optical and infrared (IR) wavelengths\nof distant red2 galaxies (up to redshift of z \u223c 2) probe\nthe rest-frame UV range, in particular the mid-UV. The\nfirst high z red galaxies detected were two faint radio\nsources from the Lieden-Berkeley Deep Survey (LBDS):\nLBDS 53W091 (z =1.55) and LBDS 53W069 (z =1.43)\n(Dunlop et al. 1996; Spinrad et al. 1997; Dunlop et al.\n1999). The analysis of these systems was soon a subject of much debate. For instance, Spinrad et al. (1997)\ndetermined an age of 3.5 Gyr for LBDS 53W091, which\nposed complications to explain galaxy formation under\nan Einstein-De Sitter universe. This age was soon contested by a series of authors (Bruzual & Magris 1997;\nHeap et al. 1998; Yi et al. 2000) that derived much\nyounger ages (<2 Gyr), which allowed for more comfortable estimates for the formation redshift (zF ) of the\ngalaxies. Subsequent analyses revived the polemic by\nconfirming the first determinations, i.e. ascribing ages\nin excess of 3 Gyr (Nolan et al. 2003; Ferreras & Yi\n2004). Aside from the different methodologies used\nfor the age determinations, it was clear that our poor\nknowledge of the UV spectrum of the presumably well\nunderstood MS stars (e.g., Peterson, Dorman & Rood\n2001) was (and still is to some extent) a major drawback\nthat has prevented the unambiguous determination of\nthe main properties (age and chemical composition) of\nthese distant systems.\nMore recently, a series of deep surveys have been\nconducted (Cimatti et al. 2002; Abraham et al. 2004;\nMcCarthy et al. 2004) and now include well over\n300 systems with similar spectrophotometric properties as those of the prototypical LBDS 53W091.\nCimatti et al. (2008) presented what perhaps is the best\nspectrum representative of distant red objects. Within\nthe Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep Sky Survey\n(GMASS) program, they selected 13 passive galaxies\n(with 1.3 < z < 2.0) on the basis of their red UV color,\ndefined as the magnitude difference between two bands\n(each of 400 \u00c5 width) centered at 2900 and 3300 \u00c5, and\nconstructed a stacked spectrum that totalled nearly 500\nhours of observing time at the Very Large Telescope.\nBy comparing that spectrum with single stellar populations (SSPs) from several population synthesis codes\n(Bruzual & Charlot 2003; Maraston 2005), they determined, from the rest-frame UV alone, ages that ranged\nfrom 0.7 to 2.8 Gyr and metallicities in the range 0.2\nto 1.5 Z\u2299 . By adding to the comparison near and mid\n2 In\n\nthe context of this paper, we ascribe red galaxies to the extremely red objects (EROs), that are intrinsically red, and not\nto the dust-enshrouded star-forming systems.\n\nIR photometric data, they significantly constrained the\nages to 1\u20131.6 Gyr and found that Z = Z\u2299 provided the\nbest results.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the GMASS stacked spectrum of\nthe 13 red galaxies (black) together with three different\nSSPs of various ages and chemical compositions. As a\nqualitative demonstration of the AMD in the UV, we\nnote that the observed spectrum is very similar to the\nmiddle two SSP fluxes constructed with quite different\nparameters.\nIt is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss any detail on the procedures so far delevoped to establish the\nage and chemical composition of distant systems. We,\nnevertheless, believe that in general the spectrophotometric analysis of distant objects has been carried out\nwith stellar libraries that might be inadequate, in particular concerning the spectral resolution and capabilities of representing real stars.\n\n5 Evolved Stellar Populations in the UV\nBack in 2002 the Stellar Atmospheres and Populations\nResearch Group (GrAPEs\u2013for its designation in spanish) at the Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica, \u00d3ptica\ny Electr\u00f3nica initiated a project aimed at providing\nupdated stellar tools for the analysis of the UV spectra of a variety of stellar aggregates, mainly evolved\nones. The overall project consists in four main steps,\nnamely a)- the creation of a theoretical stellar database\nthat we have called UVBLUE3 , b)- the comparison\nof such data base with observational stellar data, c)the calculation of a set of synthetic SEDs of SSPs and\ntheir validation through a comparison with observations of a sample of Galactic globular clusters, d)- construction of models for dating local ellipticals and distant red galaxies. In Chavez (2009), we presented a\nsummary of the results obtained in steps (a) and (b)\nand the reader is referred to that paper and the original references for a detailed description of the project\n(Rodriguez-Merino et al. 2005; Chavez et al. 2007). In\nwhat follows, we elaborate on the third step.\n5.1 UV Spectroscopic Indices in Globular Clusters\nIn Chavez et al. (2009) we presented the first theoretical analysis of the UV integrated spectra of evolved\nSSPs (see also Maraston et al. 2009, for young populations). We focused on particular absorption lines and\nblends to establish, through the use of spectroscopic\nindices, their behavior in terms of age and chemical\n3 http://www.inaoep.mx/\u223cmodelos/uvblue/uvblue.html\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 3 GMASS composite spectrum (in black) compared to three theoretical SSP energy distributions calculated with\nUVBLUE database and the synthesis code of Bressan, Chiosi & Fagotto (1994) with the updates described in Chavez et al.\n(2009). Qualitatively, high z galaxies can be well represented by either a very young (0.6Gyr) and solar metallicity or a\nrather old (8Gyr) subsolar ([M/H]=-1.7) populations\n\ncomposition. We identified several interesting tendencies, such as the low general sensitivity of the indices\nto age and the remarkably distinct behavior of the indices Fe ii 2332 and Fe ii 2402, at super solar regimes\n(in fact, we propose these indices as a promising tool\nto establish the age in metal-rich systems). Synthetic\nindices were compared to IUE low resolution observations of prototypical simple populations, i.e. globular\nclusters, and the results were highly encouraging, indicating that theoretical SSPs might be confidently used\nin the analysis of more complex systems. There were\ntwo additional results that will be important in future\nanalyses: we quantitatively showed that the presence\nof hot stars (e.g., blue stragglers and blue horizontal\nbranch (B-HB) objects, which, by the way, are among\nthe main contributors to the far-UV rising branch) can\nsignificantly dilute the mid-UV absorption indices, and\nthat the enhancement of \u03b1-elements considerably modifies the overall SED of evolved populations.\nBased on the results obtained so far, the project at\nits current stage is now focusing on the detailed analysis\nof local (mostly based on IUE observations) and distant\nevolved systems. This study will include, in a similar\nway as Cimatti et al. (2008), two steps: we are first\nconducting a UV analysis that will be later followed by\na panchromatic study using, for instance, the modelling\n\nmachinery developed by Panuzzo et al. (2005). We are\nalso carrying out a detailed study of the far-UV indices\nand its validation process (as we did in the mid-UV)\nwith the main goal of determining the metallicity of\nthe objects responsible of the far-UV up turn.\n5.2 The Sun, M32, and Distant Red Galaxies from a\nPurely UV Perspective\nIn Bertone & Chavez (2009), we presented a preliminary study of the mid-UV spectra of the Sun and M32\nand determined, through a \u03c72\u03bd analysis, their age and\nchemical composition. Briefly, this analysis consisted\nin comparing the observed SEDs of the Sun, extracted\nfrom the UARS/SUSIM archive4 , and that of M32,\ntaken with the Faint Object Spectrograph onboard the\nHubble Space Telescope (program 1D=6636; PI: M.\nGregg), to a set of theoretical integrated spectra calculated with the synthesis code developed by Buzzoni\n(1989). In the synthesis code, we have incorporated the\nUVBLUE stellar library and considered a red HB morphology with a Salpeter initial mass function (s=2.35).\nThe results are listed in Table 5.2 (see Bertone & Chavez\n2009, for more details). Interestingly, we obtained that\n4 http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataset/UARS/SUSIM\n\n\f6\n\nfor the Sun (or, equivalently, for a population whose\nmid-UV spectrum is dominated by stars like the Sun),\nthe absolute chi-square minimum is found for the solar\nmetallicity and an age of 10.1 Gyr. This result is in\nremarkably good agreement with the solar age at the\nturn-off (e.g., Jorgensen 1991, 10.5 Gyr). Similarly, for\nthe central region of M32 we found a best fiducial age\nfor the stellar population of the central region of M32 of\n3.64 Gyr, at solar metallicity. This result is, again, in\nquite good agreement with the generally accepted age\nof 3\u20134 Gyr at solar (or slightly super-solar) metallicity\n(see, e.g., Worthey 2004; Schiavon et al. 2004).\nWe have to note, however, that even though we obtained a \"best value\", in many instances, it is difficult to\nassess the significance of the difference of the minimum\n\u03c72\u03bd values at the different metallicities. For example,\nthe lowest \u03c72\u03bd for Z=0.01, solar, and 0.03 for M32 are\nquite similar. Moreover, these results indicate that the\nsmall difference in the metal content between Z=0.01\nand 0.017 produces a tremendous shift in the age of\nabout 10 Gyr. This indicates that the age-metallicity\ndegeneration is clearly present in UV spectra of stellar\nsystems and, as mentioned before, operates in a different manner with respect to the optical.\nA provocative exercise is to try to determine the age\nand chemical composition of distant ellipticals from a\nsimilar analysis, this is, solely based on their mid-UV\nspectrum. One of course can brandish that a panchromatic analysis (UV+optical+IR) should lead to an unambiguous determination of the parameters. Nevertheless, allow us, for now, to assume that we can not complement our UV data with optical and IR (or (sub)-mm\ndata) as might be the case for the distant EROs for\nwhich we only have the IR fluxes (used for their selection from the surveys). Let us also assume that the UV\nlight is indeed dominated by MS stars at the turn-off,\nas would be expected for systems such as globular clusters with red-clumped HBs or galaxies devoid of field\ncounterparts of B-HB stars and their progeny. In other\nwords, the global shape of the SEDs is not modified\nand the mid-UV spectroscopic indices are not diluted\nby the presence of hotter stars than the MS turn-off.\nThis latter assumption might be tested with the measurement of the excess in the far-UV. Let us finally\ntake for granted that the co-added spectrum depicted\nin Fig. 3 is representative of distant single objects.\nFigure 4 shows the \u03c72\u03bd distribution vs. age for the\nGMASS spectrum. For the analysis of this spectrum we\nhave used the synthesis code of Bressan, Chiosi & Fagotto\n(1994) with the updates described in Chavez et al.\n(2009). The metallicities considered for this case range\nfrom Z=0.0004 to 0.05 (as labelled in the figure). The\nreason for using this code is that it includes younger\n\nTable 1 Age and metallicity for the SUN and M 32.\n\nZ\n0.0001\n0.001\n0.010\n0.017\n0.03\n0.1\n\nSun\nAge (Gyr)\n9.575\n15.000\n15.000\n10.115 +1.620\n\u22121.255\n7.465+1.210\n\u22120.995\n6.000\n\n\u03c72\u03bd\n\nM 32\nAge (Gyr)\n\n\u03c72\u03bd\n\n4347.0\n2542.6\n82.6\n8.9\n9.9\n57.6\n\n10.000\n15.000\n13.040\n3.640+0.725\n\u22120.440\n2.790+0.515\n\u22120.545\n6.000\n\n153.9\n84.7\n19.5\n14.3\n15.1\n82.2\n\nages (<2 Gyr) than that of Buzzoni (1989). The analysis indicates (see results in Table 2) that the smallest\n\u03c72\u03bd is obtained for an age of 2.40 Gyr and a chemical\ncomposition of Z=0.004. Nevertheless, analogously to\nthe trends found for the Sun and M32, the minima are\nstill more uneffective to segregate which of the results\nis more reliable.\nAt present, we are conducting the detailed analysis\nof the full sample of elliptical galaxies observed by IUE\nand instrisically distant red objects. The aim is not\nonly to test other statistical methods (aside from the\nreduced \u03c72\u03bd ), but to also test the validity of the different\nassumptions upon which the studies can de carried out.\n\n6 A Wish List for the World Space\nObservatory-UV\nIn the context of what we have discussed above, the\nWSO-UV (Shustov et al. 2009) will undoubtedly impact our knowledge on the UV properties of evolved\npopulations. With its large aperture (as compared to\nits UV predecesors) and enhanced detectors sensitivities will:\n\u2022 Significantly increase the quality (and quantity) of\nstars enabling us to construct a robust empirical\ndatabase. As quoted by Chavez et al. (2007) and\nMaraston et al. (2009), the IUE stellar library has\nprevailed as the most complete for the analyses of\n\nTable 2 Best fit parameters for GMASS galaxies\n\nZ\n0.0004\n0.0040\n0.0080\n0.0200\n0.0500\n\nAge (Gyr)\n\n\u03c72\u03bd\n\n11.75\n2.40\n1.45\n0.90\n0.55\n\n2.81\n2.77\n2.96\n3.32\n3.69\n\n\f7\n\n0.05\n0.02\n0.008\n0.004\n0.0004\n\nFig. 4 Distribution of \u03c72\u03bd vs. age at different metallicities for the composite GMASS spectrum of Cimatti et al.\n(2008).

We, however, badly need to cope\nwith the pausity in the coverage of the parameter\nspace, particularly the metallicities.\n\u2022 Increase the number of globular clusters (and old\nopen clusters) to re-test the adequacy of SSP models.
