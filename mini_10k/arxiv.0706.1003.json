Culter: every polygonal outer\nbilliard has a periodic trajectory.\n\nThis note is an exposition of a theorem proved by Chris Culter, then an\nundergraduate student; he obtained this result as a participant of the 2004\nPenn State REU program.1 A complete account of Culter's work involving\na more general class of maps and a more detailed analysis of their periodic\norbits will appear in his paper, currently in progress.\nAn outer billiard table is a compact convex domain P . Pick a point x\noutside P . There are two support lines from x to P ; choose one of them,\nsay, the right one from the view-point of x, and reflect x in the support\npoint. One obtains a new point, y, and the transformation T : x 7\u2192 y is the\nouter (a.k.a. dual) billiard map, see figure 1. The map T is not defined if\nthe support line has a segment in common with the outer billiard table. In\nthis note, P is a convex n-gon; the set of points for which T or any of its\niterations is not defined is contained in a countable union of lines and has\nzero measure. For ease of exposition, we assume that P has no parallel sides.\nOuter billiards were introduced in [7] and popularized in [5, 6]; we refer to\n[1, 14, 15] for surveys. Here we are concerned with the existence of periodic\nDepartment of Mathematics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA\n16802, USA; e-mail: tabachni@math.psu.edu\n1\nThe program was supported by an NSF grant; the problem solved by Culter was\nproposed by the author of this note.\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n\fx\n\ny\n\nFigure 1: Definition of the outer billiard map\ntrajectories of the outer billiard map. For the conventional, inner, billiards\nit is an outstanding open problem whether every polygon has a periodic\nbilliard path. The best result so far is a theorem of R. Schwartz: every\nobtuse triangle with the obtuse angle not greater than 100\u25e6 has a periodic\ntrajectory, see [9, 10, 11]. Note also that both inner and outer polygonal\nbilliards on the sphere S 2 may have no periodic trajectories at all, see [3].\nIt will be convenient to consider the second iteration T 2 of the outer\nbilliard map. Connecting the consecutive points of a periodic trajectory of\nT 2 , one obtains a closed polygonal line. The number of turns made by this\nline about the billiard table is called the rotation number. The main result\nis as follows.\nTheorem 1 The map T 2 has a periodic trajectory that lies outside of any\ncompact neighborhood of P and has rotation number 1.\nProof of Theorem. For every outer billiard, not necessarily polygonal, the\nasymptotic dynamics of the map T 2 at infinity has the following description;\nsee the sited surveys or [16, 17, 18]. A bird's eye view of a outer billiard is\nalmost a point and the map T is almost the reflection in this point. More\nprecisely, after rescaling, the distance between a point x and T 2 (x) is very\nsmall, and the evolution of a point under T 2 appears a continuous clockwise\nmotion along a centrally symmetric curve R.\nIn our case, R is a convex 2n-gon, and each vector (x, T 2 (x)) belongs to a\nfinite set {\u00b1v1 , . . . , \u00b1vn }. These vectors are as follows. For every direction,\nother than the directions of the sides, there exists a pair of parallel support\n2\n\n\flines to P ; the vector vi is twice the vector connecting the respective support\nvertices of P , see figure 2. For example, if P is a triangle then R is an\naffine-regular hexagon.\nx\n\ny\n\nvi\n\nz\n\nFigure 2: The second iteration of the outer billiard map\nConsider the polygon R (defined up to dilation). To every side of R there\ncorresponds \"time\", the ratio of the length of this side to the magnitude\nof the respective vector vi . One obtains a collection of \"times\" (t1 , . . . , tk ),\ndefined up to a common factor. The polygon P is called quasi-rational if\nall these numbers are rational multiples of each other. For example, lattice\npolygons are quasi-rational and so are affine-regular ones. It is known that\nthe orbits of the outer billiard about a quasi-rational polygon are bounded,\nsee [2, 4, 8] or the cited surveys. Recently R. Schwartz proved that polygonal\nouter billiards may have orbits escaping to infinity [12, 13].\nThe actual map T 2 , sufficiently far away from P , is a piece-wise parallel\ntranslation through the vectors \u00b1v1 , . . . , \u00b1vn . The discontinuities are 2n\nrays: the clockwise extensions of the sides of P and the reflections of these\nrays in the opposite vertices of P (a vertex opposite to a side is the one\nfarthest from it). The lines containing these 2n rays form n strips S1 , . . . , Sn\nwhose intersection contains P , see figure 3.\nChoose an origin O inside P and consider the lines L1 , . . . , Ln through O\nparallel to the sides of P . Fix the above described polygon R so that O is\nits center. Denote by qR the dilation of R with coefficient q. These polygons\ncan be constructed by choosing a starting point on L1 , drawing the line in\nthe direction v1 until its intersection with L2 , then drawing the line in the\ndirection v2 until its intersection with L3 , etc.\nLet p1 , . . . , pn be positive integers. Denote by Q(p1 , . . . , pn ) the centrally\n3\n\n\fL1\n\nL2\n\nR\n\nO\nP\n\nL3\n\nL4\n\nFigure 3: The lines Li , the strips Si and the polygon R\nsymmetric 2n-gon whose sides are given by the vectors\np1 v1 , p2 v2 , . . . , pn vn , \u2212p1 v1 , . . . , \u2212pn vn\nand whose center is O. We wish to show that, for an appropriate choice of\np1 , . . . , pn , the polygon Q(p1 , . . . , pn ) is an orbit of the map T 2 . For this, the\nvertices of Q(p1 , . . . , pn ) should lie inside the strips Si (the opposite vertices\nin the same strip).\nClearly, there is \u03b5 > 0 (depending only on P and the choice of the origin)\nsuch that if the vertices of an 2n-gon Q are \u03b5-close to the respective vertices\nof a polygon qR then the vertices of Q lie inside the strips Si . We claim\nthat there exist arbitrarily large real q and integers p1 , . . . , pn such that the\nrespective vertices of qR and Q(p1 , . . . , pn ) are within \u03b5 from each other.\nFor the claim to hold, it will suffice to have\n|qti \u2212 pi | < \u03b4, i = 1, . . . , n\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4 > 0 is a small enough constant. Indeed, the first vertex of the\n\n4\n\n\fpolygon qR is\n\n1X\n\u2212\nqti vi ,\n2 1\nn\n\nwhereas that of the polygon Q(p1 , . . . , pn ) is\n1X\n\u2212\npi vi ,\n2 1\nn\n\nand similarly for the other vertices.\nFinally, consider the torus T n = Rn /Zn , and let Ft be the constant flow\nwith the vector (t1 , . . . , tn ). Then (1) means that Fq (O) is \u03b4-close to O where\nO = (0, . . . , 0). Indeed, the flow Ft is either periodic, and then Fq (O) = O\nfor q forming an arithmetic progression, or quasi-periodic and thus returning\narbitrarily close to the initial point infinitely often. \u2737\nRemarks. 1. A composition of a number of central symmetries is either a\ncentral symmetry or a parallel translation. It follows that a k-periodic point\nof the outer billiard map about a polygon has a polygonal neighborhood\nconsisting of periodic points with period k or 2k (the latter holds if k is\nodd).\n2. The density of the numbers q satisfying (1) is positive. One can deduce\nthat the lower density of the set of periodic trajectories described in Theorem\n1 is also positive.\n3. A periodic trajectory of the polygonal outer billiard map is called stable\nif, under an arbitrary small perturbation of the outer billiard polygon P , the\ntrajectory is also perturbed but not destroyed. A criterion for stability is\nknown, see [14]. Enumerate the vertices of P counterclockwise as A1 , . . . , An .\nAn even-periodic orbit of the dual billiard map is encoded by the sequence\nvertices in which the consecutive reflections occur. One obtains a cyclic word\nW in the letters A1 , . . . , An . The orbit is stable if and only if each appearance\nof every letter in an odd position in W is balanced by its appearance in an\neven position. By this criterion, the periodic trajectories of Theorem 1 are\nstable.\nAcknowledgments. Many thanks to C. Culter for numerous discussions\nand to R. Schwartz for his interest.
