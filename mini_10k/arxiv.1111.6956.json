Typically, detection and spectroscopic characterization of relatively young objects, giant\nplanets, and brown dwarfs are possible around nearby stars. With the worldwide emergence of Extremely\nLarge Telescope (ELT) projects, older and fainter companions will become accessible. These future ELTs\nwill improve the sensitivity of exoplanet searches toward lower masses and closer angular distances, ideally\ndown to rocky planets.\nUJF-Grenoble 1 / CNRS-INSU, Institut de Plan\u00e9tologie et d'Astrophysique de Grenoble (IPAG) UMR 5274, Grenoble, F38041, France\n1\n\n2\n\nAktiwave, 241 Ashley drive, Rochester, NY, 14620-USA\n\n3\n\nEuropean Southern Observatory, Karl-Schwarzschild-Strasse 2, D-85748, Garching, Germany\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nThe band-limited coronagraph (BLC, Kuchner & Traub 2002) arises as a relevant concept for the next\ngeneration of ground-based observatories since it has the advantage of being less sensitive to the primary\nmirror segmentation, unavoidable with ELTs, than to other concepts (Sivaramakrishnan & Yaitskova 2005).\nThe BLC has emerged as a pertinent candidate when compared to a large panel of coronagraphic concepts\nby means of complex simulations (Martinez et al. 2008). BLCs provide achromatic behavior, which is very\nimportant, as smooth and flat chromaticity response of the coronagraph is essential for exoplanet detection,\nas broadband observations are required for spectroscopy. The BLC is therefore an apposite candidate for any\nhigh-contrast instruments on ELTs. The BLC is also considered as a potential second-generation concept\nfor SPHERE.\nHowever, as for all concepts that theoretically provide perfect cancellation of on-axis starlight, the\nBLC faces severe construction tolerances. During the past years several prototypes have been developed\n(e.g. Debes et al. 2004; Trauger et al. 2004; Crepp et al. 2006; Trauger & Traub 2007; Moody et al. 2008)\nfor visible wavelength application, while more recently we examine the use of a halftone-dot technology,\nnamely, the microdot technique, to produce a BLC (Martinez et al. 2009b). This process allowed us to\ndevelop and test the first near-IR BLC demonstrator (hereafter, Proto 1). These microdot masks consisting\non opaque square pixels (called dots) distributed to reproduce the continuous transmission of a filter have\nseveral advantages: relative ease of manufacture, achromaticity, reproducibility, and the ability to generate\ncontinuous transmission ranges without introducing wavefront errors. In addition, the technique is adapted\nto the manufacture of a BLC regardless of the wavelength range of application (visible, near-IR, IR) as long\nas the dot size does not fall into a regime where it is comparable to or smaller than the size of the imaging\nwavelength (sub-wavelength grating situation).\nIn Martinez et al. (2009b) \u2013 hereafter Paper 1 \u2013, the principle, properties, and design guidelines for such\na mask construction were provided, and laboratory results obtained in the near-infrared were presented. In\nthis paper, we report improvement in the accuracy of the control of the local transmission of the manufactured microdot prototype with a second-generation prototype (hereafter, Proto 2), and demonstrate improved\nperformance. While Proto 1 was tested with a clear aperture (off-axis telescope), the characterization of\nProto 2 is extended to the case of present-day (Very Large Telescope) and future telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) designs. In addition, the response of the BLC to the pupil-stop shape is discussed\nthrough the use of a large panel of designs delivering various throughputs.\nIn Section 2 we merely recall the theory of the BLC, while in Section 3 we present the halftone-dot\ntechnology and discussed the improvement made with our recent H-band device. Section 4 is dedicated to\nthe experimental evaluation of the prototype performance. Finally, in Section 5 we draw conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nThe Band-Limited Coronagraph\n\nThe BLC was proposed by Kuchner & Traub (2002) to both block light and manage diffraction effects\ncaused by removal of the light. Since the theory is detailed in several papers (e.g., Kuchner & Traub (2002)),\nwe solely provide here a brief overview.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nWe consider the following BLC amplitude mask function:\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u000frD \u0013\u0013\nM(r) = N 1 \u2212 sinc\n\u03bb\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the application, r is the radial coordinate in the image plane, D is the telescope\nprimary diameter, \u000f is the bandwidth that rules the inner-working angle of the coronagraph (IWA hereafter),\nand finally N is a constant of normalization insuring that 0 5 M(r) 5 1. We can now express its Fourier\ntransform denoted as M (u):\n\u0012 \u0012 u\u03bb \u0013\n\u0012 u\u03bb \u0013\u0013\n\u03bb\nM (u) = N \u03b4\n\u2212\n\u00d7\u03a0\n(2)\nD\n\u000fD\n\u000fD\nwhere u stands for the radial coordinate of the pupil plane, \u03b4 the Dirac-function, and \u03a0 the top-hat function.\nThe power of a BLC comes from the properties that M (u) is equal to zero everywhere but |u| < \u000fD\n2\u03bb , i.e.\nthe power spectrum of M(r) has power in a limited domain of frequencies (i.e., a band-limited image mask):\nM (u) = 0, | u |<\n\n\u000fD\n2\u03bb\n\n(3)\n\nAs a result, the convolution product of M (u) by the pupil aperture confines the diffracted light in the vicinity\nof the pupil edges (by diffracting all the light from an on-axis source to angles within \u000fD\n2\u03bb of the edges of the\npupil), which can be completely removed with an adequate undersized pupil-stop. A BLC has full discovery\nspace, intrinsic achromatic properties, and an adaptable IWA.\n\n3.\n\nHalftone-dot technology\n\nControlling the amplitude of light is crucial to many scientific applications, such as those in imaging\nsystems, astronomical instruments, or laser physics. In the context of a coronagraph, because it interacts\nwith focused light, such devices experience tighter manufacturing tolerances and issues. The halftone-dot\ntechnology consists of the process of presenting a continuous image through use of dots (the schematic\nprinciple is presented in Fig. 1); it originally took its origin in the printing industry. With this process,\ncustomized filters with spatially varying transmissions are produced using a binary array of metal pixels that\noffers excellent control of the local transmission. This process represents a suitable alternative to other technologies employed for the manufacturing of BLC masks: (1) a grayscale pattern written with a high-energy\nbeam sensitive glass using e-beam lithography, (2) a notch filter pattern written with a thick Chromium layer\non a substrate, dry etched with high density decoupled plasma, (3/) a grayscale pattern manufactured with\nvacuum-deposited metals and dielectrics. The halftone-dot technology has been selected for the manufacturing of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam coronagraphs (Krist et al. 2009), and for both\nthe SPHERE and GPI coronagraphs (apodizer masks for the apodized-pupil Lyot coronagraph).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Principle of the halftone-dot technology for coronagraphy\n3.1.\n\nPrinciple of a Microdot BLC Mask\n\nA BLC manufactured in microdots consists in an array of dots (i.e., pixels) that are either opaque or\ntransparent (Fig. 1). It is fabricated by lithography of a light-blocking metal layer deposited on a transparent glass substrate. To best approximate the selected BLC function, the dot distribution is regulated by a\nFloyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm (Floyd & Steinberg 1976), based on the error diffusion principle, which\nallows the accurate generation of grey levels and rapidly varying shaping functions. This specific algorithm\nis presented and discussed for printing technique applications (Ulichney 1987, 1988), for laser beam shaping (Dorrer & Zuegel 2007), and for coronagraphy in the context of the manufacture of pupil-apodizers\n(Martinez et al. 2009a,c, 2010). We note that another algorithm (emphasizing randomize dot distribution)\nhas been successfully used to produce BLC in microdots for the JWST/NIRCam (Krist et al. 2009).\nBriefly, we detailed the principle of the error-diffusion algorithm. The error-diffusion algorithm is used\nto calculate the density distribution that most effectively reproduces the required field transmission; the\nalgorithm chooses the transmission of a given pixel of the pattern (either 0% or 100%) by comparing the\ntransmission required at this location to a 50% threshold, i.e., the transmission is set to zero if the required\ntransmission is smaller, or to one otherwise. The induced transmission error is diffused into adjacent pixels\nthat have not yet been processed by biasing the transmission required at the corresponding locations. This\nlocally cancels the error of the binary optics introduced by the process of writing the required transmission\n(in gray levels) into binary values. The advantage of the error diffusion algorithm is that the introduced noise\nis blue, i.e., the noise spectral density is only significant at high spatial frequencies, whereas randomized\nbased dot distribution algorithms introduce white noise. Then fabrication errors enter the game, and multiple\nvariations of the design are required to accommodate best fabrication errors.\nIn Paper 1, we showed that although total starlight cancellation cannot be achieved with a microdot\nBLC, the technology does not preclude deep high contrast levels. This impossibility of delivering perfect\nstarlight removal originates from the difference in frequency contents between a microdot BLC and a theoretical continuous mask. The function of the microdot BLC is indeed sampled by the dots, which forces its\nFourier transform M (u) to be periodic, and the algorithm used to distribute dots introduce high-frequency\nnoise. Thus, Eq. 3 is no longer satisfied. However, contrast levels enabled in such a situation are a function\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Picture of the BL5 prototype (left), and in its integration mount (right).\nof pixel size, since this allows finer control of the local transmission and is formally equivalent to a sampling\nproblem. A simple metric was derived in Paper 1 to define the sampling of the BLC function as the ratio of\nthe Airy unit by the dot size (p). This metrics is defined at the shortest wavelength for which the BLC mask\nis designed to operate, and can be expressed as:\ns=\n\nF# \u00d7 \u03bbmin\np\n\n(4)\n\nwhere F# is the f -number on the mask and \u03bbmin the shortest wavelength of the application (i.e., insuring\nthat s remains greater than the specification for all wavelengths). Using simulation maps of BLCs designed\nin microdots (assuming specified dot spatial distribution), we analyzed how the dot size affects the coronagraphic performance with respect to continuous idealistic masks. We identified two sampling configurations\nsuitable for near-IR operation: s = 16 and s = 8.\nIn addition, on the basis of simulations, we pointed out that the interest of the microdot technique in the\nlight of contrast and inner-working angle requirements is not dependent of the BLC function bandwidth (\u000f,\nwhich rules the IWA) assuming IWA \u2265 3\u03bb/D, which falls in agreement with EPICS (20-30 mas in H-band)\nand SPHERE (0.1 arcsec in H-band) standard requirements.\nIn this context we developed Proto 1 in two versions, with s = 16 and s = 8 configurations. Both have\ndemonstrated impressive and similar performance in the laboratory.\n\n3.2.\n\nCurrent device\n\nProto 2 is based on the same amplitude mask function as Proto 1, being expressed in Equation 2\n(\u000f = 0.17, defining an inner-working angle of 5\u03bb/D), and the following microdot parameter: s = 16 (p =5\n\u03bcm, \u03bbmin =1.64 \u03bcm, and F# = 48.8). The BLC amplitude mask function was originally proposed by Kuchner\n& Traub (2002).\nLike Proto 1, Proto 2 was manufactured by Precision Optical imaging (Rochester, New York), was\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Measured profiles of BL5 from the center to the edges of the pattern and their comparison to\nspecifications (left). The corresponding transmission error is as function of the radius (right).\ndesigned for the H-band, and was fabricated using wet-etch contact lithography of an Aluminum layer\n(OD = 8+, e = 2000\u0226) deposited on a BK7 substrate (\u03bb/10 peak-to-valley, 0.5 inch diameter). Antireflection coating has been applied for each face (R < 0.5%). Such OD is required to guarantee against leakage\ngreater than the intrinsic limitation of the microdot technique (s = 16, see Paper 1). A set of pictures of\nBL5 is shown in Figure 2 before and after integration of the mask onto its mechanical support. The size\nof the dots has been confirmed by a microscopic measurement. Its profile was measured at 1.0\u03bcm, and the\nspatially resolved transmission has been obtained after background subtraction and flat field normalization.\nProto 1 profile accuracy was of about 5% from the specification, where the error was mostly localized in\nthe outer part of the mask (high-transmission part), while the center part (for low-transmissions) was highly\naccurate (Paper 1). The error took its origin in a calibration issue of the process, which has been corrected\nthrough several runs to increase the accuracy. Multiple variations of the design on the BL5 mask have been\nrealized to accommodate best fabrication errors. The profile accuracy of Proto 2 stands below 1% (Fig. 3)\neverywhere except in the small and central area of the pattern (from the center to 0.4 mm radius) where\nthe error rises to a maximum of 3.6% at the center and otherwise remains below 3%. It is believed that the\ndiscrepancy at the center of the BL5 is a measurement bias rather than a real error on the profile. The reason\nis threefold: (1) The error terms on the design behave according to the error diffusion algorithm, which is\nnot compatible with an increase of the error around the design transmission close to zero, while fabrication\nerrors occur regardless from the position on the mask. (2) Although a proper measurement of the OD has not\nbeen carried out (specification is OD = 8+), the laboratory results obtained with BL5 and presented in the\nnext section guarantee that at least OD = 4 (peak rejection is of about \u223c 10\u22124 ). This level of OD limits the\ntransmission leakage at the center of the part; (3) Because the profile presented in Figure 3 corresponds to a\nradial average, the characteristics of the optical setup used for the characterization of the part, the centering\nand alignment of the BL5 during the measurement does impact its reliability at very low transmission. For\ninstance, as the sampling in the camera plane is finite to approximately 30 \u03bcm, the centering of the part is\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Top row: entrance pupil apertures available for the experiment (from the left to the right: clear\npupil, VLT pupil, and E-ELT pupil). Bottom row: corresponding BLC pupil-stops.\nan important issue. Because the intensity is roughly parabolic at the center, with an offset of the center, the\nradial average then corresponds to a sum of parabola with the same curvature but a slightly different origin.\nThis leads to a parabola with the same curvature, but a non-zero origin. This is observed in the data, as\nthere is a non-zero slope at the center of the radial intensity, whereas the slope would be expected to be\nequal to zero. Since the intensity at the origin is used to remove the background, this leads to a higher than\nexpected value of the measured radial intensity away from the origin, hence the observed error for small\ntransmissions.\n\n4.\n\nLaboratory evaluation and results\n4.1.\n\nOptical Setup\n\nThe optical setup used to characterize the BL5 prototype is the same as the one presented in Paper\n1. Briefly, the setup is a near-infrared coronagraphic transmission bench developed at ESO. All the optics\nare set on a table with air suspension in a dark room and are fully covered with protection panels forming\na nearly closed box preventing turbulence from the room. The entrance aperture is 3 mm diameter (\u03a6),\nand reimaging optics are made with IR achromatic doublets. The pupil patterns that can be used on the\nbench are shown in Figure 4. The IR camera (the Infrared Test Camera) uses a HAWAII 1k \u00d7 1k detector.\nThe experiment was done in H-band using either a narrow filter (\u2206\u03bb/\u03bb = 1.4%) or a broadband filter\n(\u2206\u03bb/\u03bb = 24%). The Strehl ratio of the bench was evaluated to \u223c 92%.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Left: experimental results obtained with BL5 with a narrow and broadband filter in the near-IR.\nRight: experimental results obtained with BL5 with a clear pupil, the VLT pupil, and the E-ELT pupil in the\nnear-IR. Profiles are azimuthally averaged.\n4.2.\n4.2.1.\n\nPerformance Assessment\n\nFundamental Performance of Proto 2\n\nTo assess the fundamental performance of Proto 2, we first tested the device with a full circular pupil\n(Figure 4, top row, left image). For the tests described in this sub-section, the experimental conditions\nare exactly similar to the ones occurring during the evaluation of Proto 1 and reported in Paper 1. The\npupil-stop is the same (diameter D stop = 0.84 \u00d7 \u03a6, see Figure4 bottom row, left image), and data have\nbeen reduced likewise. Contrast profiles are azimuthally averaged, and were obtained without any active\nwavefront correction, nor particular data reduction post-processing. Neutral density filters were applied on\nnon-coronagraphic images only. Dark frames were obtained by switching off the artificial star source, and\nthe data reduction only corrects bad pixels, background, and scales images by the exposure time and optical\ndensity.\nCoronagraphic profiles of Proto 2 in the two spectral conditions (\u2206\u03bb/\u03bb = 1.4%, and 24%) are gathered\nin Figure 5 (left), and roughly yields identical performance. That demonstrates the capability of Proto 2 to\nachromatically reduce starlight over a wide spectral range. The contrast evolves from 2\u00d710\u22126 to 10\u22126 from\n\nProto 1\nProto 2\n\n\u03c4\n2410\n5360\n\n\u03c40\n2554\n6792\n\nC5\u03bb/D\n3.7 \u00d7 10\u22125\n1.7 \u00d7 10\u22126\n\nE (%)\n\u223c5\n<1\n\nTable 1: Summary of Coronagraphic Results Obtained with BL5: Proto 1 Compared to Proto 2 (\u2206\u03bb/\u03bb =\n24%).

The arbitrary\nfalse color distribution has been chosen to enhance contrast for the sake of clarity.\n3\u03bb/D to farther angular distances limited by the speckle noise level on the bench. At IWA, the contrast\nis 1.7\u00d710\u22126 , which corresponds to an improvement of contrast of a factor of 30 over Proto 1. The peak\nrejection rate (denoted \u03c40 , being the ratio of the maximum of the direct image to that of the coronagraphic\nimage) is 6792, which is \u223c2.7 times better than the peak rejection delivered by Proto 1. The total rejection\nfactor (the ratio of total intensity of the direct image to that of the coronagraphic image, denoted \u03c4) follows\nthe improvement likewise and is reported in Table 1. The point-spread function (PSF) and coronagraphic\nimages are presented in Figure6 (left column).\nWhile the improvement in profile accuracy (E ) over Proto 1 did enhance the peak rejection and contrast\nlevel, discrepancy still remains between our actual measurements and the simulation predictions (as formerly\nreported for Proto 1 in Paper 1). At this level of contrast it is difficult to ascertain source of errors, although\nthe scatter-light due to imperfect optical components that create speckles in the scientific image and mask\nprofile errors are first to come to mind. Proto 1 was mainly affected by the profile error, which was found\nto be consistent with the discrepancy found at small angular separations (i.e. peak level error), while the\nwavefront errors (wavefront high-frequency components) were identified as the dominant source of error in\nthe halo. An overall approximated total amount of wavefront error of \u223c \u03bb/67 rms at 1.6 microns, (i.e. 24 nm\nrms) was estimated prior to the pupil stop (Paper 1). Simulations using the actual profile of Proto 2 shows\nthat the profile error does not preclude to reach deeper contrast than 10\u22126 , while the estimated wavefront\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nerror limits the contrast to \u223c 10\u22127 . Thus, it does not explain our current limitation of contrast. However, our\nbench is not in a clean room environment and dust contamination is significant on all our optics. Given the\nsmall size of the pupil, a dust density map estimation over the pupil area has to be taken into account for\nproper simulation analysis. Because the speckle noise level on the bench is at the level of 10\u22126 and cannot\nbe explained by manufacturing aspects of Proto 2, or wavefront error estimation of the optical components\nof our setup, it is believed that dust is the main contributor to our current limitation.\n\n4.2.2.\n\nComparison with Other Mature Developments\n\nA first order comparison between our research efforts in the implementation of a BLC in microdots\nand the one presented in Krist et al. (2009) can be initiated to further validate the maturity and validity of\nthe approach. Although, functions, bandwidths, dots distribution algorithms, the way fabrication errors are\naccounted for, and the testbed are not exactly similar, the fundamental parameters are comparable. The\nBessel-squared radial profile BLC developed by Krist et al. (2009) has a 6\u03bb/D IWA (1\u03bb/D larger than\nour BL5 prototype), and a s parameter equal to 19 (F# =18, \u03bb=2.2\u03bcm, p=2.1\u03bcm), whereas s = 16 for our\nprototype. The radial profile error is not explicitly discussed in Krist et al. (2009), nonetheless from Figure\n7 of their paper, the local error seems to be at the level of few %, being mostly localized in the inner part of\nthe prototype. Their qualitative comparison between non-coronagraphic and coronagraphic images suggests\nthat the peak rejection \u03c40 is close to 104 , which is comparable to the performance presented in this paper with\nour BL5. Both developments therefore lead to similar performance, being one order of magnitude below\nthe level of the theoretical expectations presented in Paper 1 (Figure 5), where we show with numerical\nsimulations that the peak rejection limitation due to the presence of the dots is 105 when s and the IWA are\nin the order of values considered here. In both developments, it is believed that speckles due to aberrations\nin the testbed are the origin of the contrast limit.\n\n4.3.\n\nApplication to Arbitrary Telescope Apertures\n4.3.1.\n\nComplex Pupils\n\nBecause this study was originally realized in the framework of the future E-ELT high-contrast instrument (EPICS, Kasper et al. 2008), we tested Proto 2 with the telescope pupil planned for the E-ELT, though\nwe do not consider here its segmentation aspect. In addition, since actual telescopes can benefit from BLC\ncapabilities, we extended our test of Proto 2 to the case of the VLT pupil. Both aperture designs (VLT and\nE-ELT) are shown in Figure 4 (top row, middle, and right images). Our pupil masks are made in a laser-cut,\nstainless-steel sheet to an accuracy of 0.002 mm. The pupil diameter for all masks remains similar as in\nSection 4.2 (\u03a6=3mm). The VLT pupil is designed with the central obscuration scaled to 0.47 mm \u00b1 0.002\nmm (14% linear ratio) and the spider-vane thickness is 15\u03bcm \u00b1 4\u03bcm. For the E-ELT pupil, the central\nobscuration ratio is 29% (0.88 mm \u00b1 0.002 mm), and the spider-vane thickness is 40\u03bcm \u00b1 4\u03bcm. The corresponding pupil stops used in the experiment are shown in Figure 4 (bottom row, middle and right images).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThe BLC pupil-stop throughput for the VLT aperture is 42%, while the one for the E-ELT pupil is \u223c 20%.\nThe optimization of the BLC pupil stops emphasized the achromaticity aspect (24% spectral bandwidth)\nand allowing the deepest contrast possible considering the achievable contrast imposed by the presence of\nthe dots in the design (10\u22127 to 10\u22128 contrast at 5\u03bb/D, see Paper 1). Due to the complexity of the E-ELT\naperture, it imposes a severely reduced pupil stop, but one might note that its optimization can be relaxed to\naccommodate less ambitious contrast goals (e.g., 10\u22126 ). This will be further analyzed later for the case of\nthe VLT pupil.\nPSF and coronagraphic images recorded during the experiment are presented in Figure6 (middle and\nright columns). Contrast profiles are shown in Figure 5 (right), which gathered performance obtained with\nall pupil configurations (full circular pupil, VLT-pupil, and E-ELT pupil). Due to the complexity of the VLT\nand E-ELT pupils, their corresponding PSFs exhibit various diffraction patterns (central core and spider\ndiffraction spikes), and thus different PSF contrast levels (the power-law of the PSF intensity as a function\nof the angular separation deviates from the pure full pupil configuration). Whereas coronagraphic contrasts\ndegrade with the complexity of the pupil, the gain with the PSF level is roughly conservative (Figure 5).\nThe BLC delivers 1.7\u00d710\u22126 , 5\u00d710\u22126 , and 2\u00d710\u22125 contrast levels at 5\u03bb/D angular separation over 24%\nbandwidth, with a full pupil, the VLT pupil, and the E-ELT pupil respectively. This indicates that the BLC is\nable to maintain high-contrast levels with large central obscuration and spiders, unlike several coronagraphic\nconcepts.\n\nFig. 7.- Coronagraphic pupil image before the high-spatial frequency filtering of the pupil stop recorded\nin H-band, while using the VLT pupil as the entrance aperture. The image shows the distribution of the\ndiffracted light that is strictly localized in the vicinity of the pupil edges and spider arms. The arbitrary false\ncolor distribution has been chosen to enhance contrast for the sake of clarity.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- From the left to the right: specified pupil stops (black) superimposed to the VLT-pupil (red)\ncorresponding to 42%, 60%, 70%, and 92% throughput.\n4.3.2.\n\nPupil-Stop Discussion\n\nFigure 7 presents the coronagraphic pupil image before the filtering by the pupil-stop. In this case the\nentrance aperture is the VLT mask. It is clearly observable that the diffracted light is strictly localized in the\nvicinity of the pupil edges and spider arms; thus, filtering these areas is mandatory, whereas leaving some\nroom in the design of the pupil-stop. To assess the impact of the pupil-stop optimization, we compared\nthe performance delivered by Proto 2 with its initial pupil-stop to that of various alternative designs. The\nset of pupil-stops used in the experiment is shown in Figure 8, superimposed on the VLT pupil for the\nsake of clarity. From the left to the right are presented: (1) the initial pupil-stop (used in Section 4.2), (2)\na 60% throughput pupil-stop minimizing the impact of the diffracted light on the pupil edges, (3) a 70%\nthroughput pupil-stop minimizing both areas on the pupil edges and around the central obscuration, (4) a\n92% throughput pupil-stop with little shrinking of the central obscuration and pupil diameter. Spider arms\nare treated almost alike by all the masks. Results are presented in Figure 9. All configurations provide\ncoronagraphic gain, with better contrast when both pupil diameter and central obscuration are addressed\nthrough the optimization (black and blue curves). In a wide spectral bandwidth regime (24%), a contrast\nfrom 10\u22125 down to 10\u22126 at angular separations farther than 5\u03bb/D is reachable with a pupil stop throughput\nthat can basically stand in the range 40 to 70%. This still provides an excellent stellar peak rejection. This\nresult confirms that the BLC can deliver high-contrast levels with system transmission comparable to other\ncoronagraphic concepts in the face of complex pupil apertures.\n\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe described the development and laboratory experiment of a second-generation BLC mask using a\nmicrodot design in the near-infrared. Thanks to the improvement of the calibration of the manufacturing\nprocess through multiple variations of the microdot spatially distribution design, the impact of fabrication\nerrors have been reduced. The local accuracy of the BL5 profile was reduced to below 1%. This basically\ncorresponds to a factor of five improvement over the initial prototype, whereas contrast levels have been\nenhanced by more than an order of magnitude, while the peak rejection rate is doubled. This advanced\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- H-band experimental contrast levels reached with the BLC with various pupil-stops (VLT configuration).\nH-band band-limited device demonstrated excellent contrast levels down to \u223c 10\u22126 at angular separations\nfarther than 3\u03bb/D over 24% spectral bandwidth, being limited by the speckle noise on the optical bench. In\nthis context, the halftone-dot technology is confirmed as a mature solution for the development of a BLC.\nCurrent and next generation high-contrast instruments can directly benefits from such performance, as\nmore emphasis is placed on associating high-contrast suppression systems and speckle calibrations over a\nlarge spectral band. Additionally, since wavefront errors downstream of the coronagraph produce quasistatic speckles with intensities that are proportional to the residual coronagraphic peak intensity, the use of\nsuch device that allows deep peak rejection arise as a major advantage. With these considerations in mind,\nwe experimentally explored the capabilities of the BLC to maintain high contrasts with complex telescope\napertures. We show that in a wide spectral bandwidth regime (24%), a contrast from 10\u22125 down to 10\u22126 at\nangular separations farther than IWA is possible with a high stellar peak rejection (> 1000), when the BLC\nis combined with a high throughput pupil-stop (70%).\nThe activity outlined in the paper was supported by the European Commission, Seventh Framework\nProgramme (FP7), Capacities Specific Programme, Research Infrastructures; specifically the FP7, Preparing for the construction of the European Extremely Large Telescope Grant Agreement, Contract number\nINFRA-2007-2.2.1.28.
