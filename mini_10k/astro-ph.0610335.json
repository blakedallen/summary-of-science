With the detection\nof gravitational waves (GWs), astrophysicists expect to have the answer\nto many questions, as well as new ones. There are many detectors all\naround the world and, soon, even above us. With interferometric or resonant\nmass detectors, at low and high frequencies, we shall be able to see waves\n1\n\n\fcoming from coalescing binary systems, from a cosmological background,\nfrom catastrophic events etc.\nAmong the most promising sources of GWs, neutron stars (NSs) and\nblack holes (BHs) are the best candidates for a detection. These objects\nemit waves in a very wide spectrum of frequencies determined by their quasinormal modes of oscillation; and many works have been recently done to\ndetermine their characteristics (see Ref.[1] for a review).\nWe take a special attention to a small region of this spectrum, localized\nat 2.8-3.4 kHz, which is the region of operation of the resonant spherical\nantennas Mario Schenberg (Brazilian, 3.0-3.4 kHz) [2] and Mini-GRAIL\n(Dutch, 2.8-3.0 kHz) [3]. Both antennas are composed of \u223c 1 ton and\n\u223c 70 cm diameter CuAl6% spheres and will be operating in the frequency\nrange mentioned above.\nIt is worth stressing that the identification of the direction of a source,\nmaking use of only one detector, is possible only if it is a spherical antenna\n[2]. Several interferometer and bar detectors would be necessary to do the\nsame.\nOne could ask how well a spherical antenna can determine the direction of\na source. The Schenberg antenna operating at T \u223c 20mK, for example, may\nhave an angular resolution of \u03b8 \u2248 2o [4]. With the help of any electromagnetic\ndata it is possible to locate and identify a given source.\nWhen we take such a small window (2.8-3.4 kHz) to such a giant garden\nnamed the Universe, we are sure that we are losing a great amount of\ninformation. However, if we are able to focus on good accuracy to this small\nregion, we can also expect to see all the magnificence of it. This is the case\nwe are proposing in this work.\nWe analyze the case of a possible future detection made by these antennas\nin order to obtain information on its GW sources. In the case of BHs, a\ndirect detection of these mysterious objects is already of great relevance,\nbut we are specially concerned to the information we can extract from a NS\ndetection. If values of mass and radius can be extracted with some accuracy,\nwe could get additional information about the nuclear matter equation of\nstate[5]. The still obscure characteristics of nuclear matter, e.g., the values\nof compression modulus or nucleon effective mass could be clarified. We\ncould also get information on the strange quark star candidates, strange\nquark matter equation of state and phase transition[6].\nA relevant and actual issue in astrophysics refers to the existence and\ndetection of strange quark stars. Some objects have been recently detected\n2\n\n\fand issued as possible candidates to be stars formed by deconfined quark\nmatter. This is the case of EXO 0748-676, 4U 1700+24, 1E1207-5209 and\nRX J1856.5-3574 [7, 8]. We do not intend, in this work, to discuss the real\nconstitution of these stars, we just intend to show how a GW detection could\nidentify a star as a strange star.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we briefly review the\nBH and NS pulsating modes, in section 3 we discuss the detectability of NS\nmodes by the Brazilian antenna, in section 4 we consider the constraints a\nputative detection by this very antenna would impose on a class of equation\nof states, finally in section 5 we present the final remarks.\n\n2\n\nBlack Holes and Neutron Stars\n\nNSs and BHs are certainly the most important sources of GWs, which can\nbe generated by a host of pulsating modes of these stars.\nWhile BHs oscillate due to its spacetime structure perturbation, NSs\nmay also oscillate due to its fluid perturbation. This difference implies that\na NS may oscillate in many different modes and have a richer spectrum of\noscillations.\nAn excited BH may emit a great amount of GWs during its ringdown\nphase. The ringdown waveform may be completely described by the BH's\nmass and angular momentum.\nAlthough NSs possess many pulsation modes only a few of them, however,\nis of relevance for GW detection. Concerning the GW point of view the\nmost important modes for the NSs are the fundamental (f) mode of fluid\noscillation, the first few pressure (p) modes and the first GW (w) mode [9].\nIt is worth noting that different types of initial perturbations are more\nconvenient to excite each of these modes [10]. The problem of initial value in\nnumerical relativity is one of the most challenging problems to be solved in\nthe present. However, there is a currently belief that the fundamental mode\n(f-mode) may carry the greatest part of the released energy, because the\nfluid parameters undergo the largest changes, while the pressure (p-mode)\nand curvature (w-mode) would carry smaller fraction of the energy.\nIt is worth mentioning that the r-mode can also be, under certain\ncircumstances, a very important source of GWs for the NSs [11].\nAn important question is how pulsating modes are excited in the NSs,\nwhich are of our concern here. There are many scenarios that could lead to\n3\n\n\fsignificant asymmetries. Supernova explosions are expected to form wildly\npulsating NSs that emit GWs. A pessimistic estimate for the energy radiated\nas GWs indicates a total release equivalent to < 10\u22126 M\u2299 . An optimistic\nestimate, when the NS is formed, for example, from strongly non-spherical\ncollapse, suggests a release equivalent to 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22121 M\u2299 . (see, e.g., Refs.\n[1, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14].\nAnother possible excitation mechanism for NS pulsation is a starquake,\nwhich can be associated with a pulsar glitch. The energy released in this\nprocess may be of the order of the maximum mechanical energy stored in the\ncrust of the NSs, which is estimated to be of 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22127M\u2299 [15, 16]. In a\nrecent study [17] we consider the detectability of f-mode NSs in this scenario\nby the Brazilian antenna Schenberg. We showed that several events every\nyear could be detectable by this antenna.\nSoft gamma ray repeaters could be thought as starquakes occuring in\nmagnetars. This process would be responsible for an energy release, in the\nform of GWs, about to E \u223c 10\u22126 M\u2299 c2 , being detectable if it is in our own\ngalaxy [18].\nOrbiting or falling masses into NSs have been recently studied as models\nfor coalescing or acreting binaries [12]. Stellar oscillations being excited by\nthe tidal fields of the two stars, for example.\nCore quakes due to phase transitions in the inner shells of the NS could\nbe able to excite pulsation modes, releasing about E \u223c 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22121 M\u2299 c2\nin the form of GWs, and could be detected up to the Virgo cluster [6, 14].\nSimilarly, the transformation of a NS into a strange star is likely to induce\npulsations.\nAlso, in ref.[19], the rate of phase transition inside NSs has been estimated\nto be about 10\u22126 events per year and per galaxy. If in fact a detection could\nbe possible up to the Virgo cluster, this would represent a possible source of\nGWs.\nExcitation of f-mode in LMXBs is also possible, and in this case the GW\ncould well be recurrently produced, since the NS is continuously receiving\nmatter from its companion star. In a recent paper de Araujo etal [20] study\nsuch a case.\nSince the f-mode unstable NSs in LMXBs could well be a recurrent source\nof GWs, this implies that a non negligible event rate could occur in this case.\nA rough estimate, based on the event rate of superbursts in LMXBs, indicates\nthat two events every year could be detected if a sensitivity for burst sources\nof hs \u223c 10\u221223 could be achieved, and also if the efficiency of generation of\n4\n\n\fGWs could be of \u03b5GW \u223c 10\u221211 .\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that Kokkotas etal [21] shows that\ndetecting the f-mode, the EOS, the mass and the radius of the NSs will be\nstrongly constrained. The reader should appreciate the reading of this paper\nby Kokkotas etal who show in detail how these above mentioned astrophysical\ninformation is obtained from the GW data.\nIn the following subsection we briefly review the main properties of the\nNSs pulsating modes.\n\n2.1\n\nf- and p-modes\n\nThe pressure modes are the overtones of the fundamental mode. The\nfundamental mode can be described by the density distribution inside the\nstar, while the p-mode restoration force is the pressure. The f-mode, for a\ntypical NS, may appear with a GW frequency of \u03c9 \u223c 2.8kHz and damping\ntime of \u03c4 \u223c 0.1s while the first p-mode appears with \u03c9 \u223c 6kHz and \u03c4 \u223c 0.6s\n[1].\nThe fraction of energy released by each mode of oscillation is still an open\nproblem. Only full 3D relativistic numerical simulations,with appropriate\ninitial conditions, could give us considerable new information about this\nissue. Even though, it is a common belief, as already mentioned, that the\nfundamental mode is more likely to be excited than the pressure modes. It\nwould be required tens to hundred times more powerful events to make the\ndetection of a pressure mode comparable to the fundamental one [1]. Higher\npressure modes shall not contribute considerably to the GW spectrum.\nAt the actual stage of GW detectors it would be required an effective\namplitude about hef f \u223c 10\u221221 to claim for a detection. The effective\namplitude for an f-mode, described by Kokkotas [1] is given by\nhef f \u223c 2.2 \u00d7 10\n\n\u221221\n\nE\n\u22126\n10 M\u2299 c2\n\n!1/2\n\n2kHz\nf\n\n!1/2\n\n50kpc\nr\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E is the energy released in the mode, f is the frequency in kHz and\nr is the distance to the source in kpc.\nIn Ref. [22] the authors have calculated the properties of the oscillation\nmodes using a wide sample of equations of state.

Given that\nthis radius is too small for a NS, it would be certainly a strange quark star.\nNote that a NS of M \u223c 1.0 (1.4) M\u2299 with R \u223c 14 km would emit waves\nin much lower frequencies, \u03bdf \u223c 1.5 (1.7) kHz.\nAlso, if a detection is done and identified as a standard 1.4M\u2299 NS p-mode\nunstable, a too large radius would be inferred, namely, R \u223c 20 km, which is\ninconsistent with any NS model.\nIf the detection points to a putative half solar mass NS p-mode unstable,\nit would lead to a radius of R = 16.26 \u00b1 4.75km. This result could hardly,\nby itself, rule out any of the present equations of state, specially considering\nthat the p-mode damping is very dependent on the stellar model and cannot\nbe well fitted as in the case of the f-mode (see Ref.[22] for details). Due to\nits frequency bandwidth, the Schenberg detector could not see NSs far from\nthis mass range.\nNSs have a very rich spectrum of mechanical oscillations, however, other\nmodes, like w-, g- and r-modes, are not considered here because their\nfrequencies lie on a very different range and cannot be detected by the\nBrazilian and the Dutch detectors, considered in this work.\n\u0014\n\n3\n\n\u0015\n\nSchenberg Bandwidth\n\nOne of the main purposes of this work is to establish the main properties\nof the sources when the Schenberg's bandwidth (3.0-3.4 kHz) is considered.\n6\n\n\fFrom the above discussion the natural candidates for Schenberg are BHs and\nNSs.\nIn the present study, we are particulary concerned with the determination\nof the equation of state of NSs. A relevant question is how to know, in a\nputative detection by Schenberg, if the source is a NS or a BH. The basic\nway to distinguish them can be through the damping times of their oscillating\nmodes. The damping time for the quasi-normal modes of BHs is orders of\nmagnitude shorter than the f- and p- modes of NSs.\nThere is a simple relation correlating a Schwarzschild BH mass to the\nfrequency of its fundamental (quadrupole) quasi-normal mode (see, e.g., Ref.\n[1])\nM\u2299\n\u03c9 = 12.07 kHz\n(4)\nM\nwhere M is the mass in M\u2299 . This relation implies that the Schenberg antenna\nwill only see BHs if their masses are about 3.5\u22124.0M\u2299 . It is worth mentioning\nthat if rotation is considered the above mass range could be extended. A BH\nof 9M\u2299 at maximum rotating velocity could in principle be seen by Schenberg\n[23].\nThe damping time of this mode is given by [1]\n\u0012\n\n\u03c4 = 0.05 ms\n\nM\nM\u2299\n\n\u0013\n\n!\n\n;\n\n(5)\n\nwhich for BHs with masses 3.5 \u2264 M \u2264 4.0M\u2299 gives \u2243 0.2 ms.\nThe same procedure is now applied to identify f- or p-modes in the\nSchenberg antenna. A NS f-mode with frequency about 3.0 kHz presents\na damping time much larger then those presented by a BH, being of the\norder of 100 ms. This is also the case for the first p-mode, which would\nhave damping times greater then a few seconds. So, the differences of a BH\nringdown and a NS f- and p-modes are easily identified by their corresponding\ndamping times.\nEven though Schenberg could not determine the damping times within\nlow errors, such a great difference between these three modes could enable\nus to determine the mode that would excite the sphere.\nAs a restricted bandwidth implied in a corresponding restriction of BH\ncandidates due to their masses, it shall also imply in a restriction of NSs\ncandidates. In order to do a model-independent analysis, we have applied\nthe Schenberg bandwidth into the empirical relations obtained by Benhar\n7\n\n\fetal [22]. These relations determine the wave frequency and damping time\nwhen the stellar mass and radius is known.\nWe have followed in the opposite direction and determined the NS masses\nand radii that would emit f- or p-mode waves in the detector Schenberg\nbandwidth. The main results of this analysis are synthesized in figure 1,\nwhere we have plotted the regions that correspond to NSs whose GW lies\nin Schenberg frequency band. The NS mass-radius relation determines the\ncandidates for a detection by the Schenberg antenna.\nConsidering, in equation 1, a bandwidth of 3.0-3.4 kHz we obtain the\nmass-radius relation represented by the lower shaded region in figure 1:\nR=\n\n33(\u00b12)\n3.2(\u00b10.2) \u2212 0.79(\u00b10.09)\n\n!2/3\n\nM 1/3 .\n\n(6)\n\nThe upper shaded region is obtained through the same procedure, using\nthe empirical formula for the first pressure mode (equation 2):\nR=\n\n79(\u00b14)M\n,\n3.2(\u00b10.2)M + 1.5(\u00b10.8)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere, in either of above equations, the mass and radius are given in km.\nWe also plotted in figure 1 a couple of equations of state such as the\nTaurines [24] and non-linear (NL)[6] models for nuclear matter, the MIT bag\nmodel [25] and the Chromo-Dieletric model [26] for quark matter, which we\nconsider in detail in the next section.\nIf a f-mode is identified in the detector by its damping time, the most\nprobable source, considering the results of figure 1, would correspond to a\nvery compact star with radius smaller than 10 km. The models that fulfill\nthis condition are models of strange quark stars. NSs with higher masses can\nhardly account such a small radius. However, if such a detection is done,\nit would lead to important constraints on the NS matter equation of state,\nsince only a few models and free parameters sets can account for NSs with\nM \u2248 2M\u2299 and R \u2248 10km at the same time. On the other hand, pressure\nmodes would only be expected to come from low-mass NSs with very large\nradii.\nFrom the previous analysis, and considering the fact that low-mass NSs\ndo not appear in a great number in our galaxy, strange stars are the most\nprobable sources of f-mode waves to be detected by the Schenberg antenna.\nMost of the modern NS models cannot account for the small radius values\n8\n\n\fimposed by the 3.0-3.4 kHz bandwidth. One can also consider the fact that\nRX J1856-3754 [8] can, in fact, be a strange quark star, and its inferred\nvalues of mass and radius would imply in a f-mode eigenfrequency about\nthat considered by the Schenberg bandwidth.\nIt is worth noting that the constraint given by the Mini-GRAIL detector\nis lighter (see 2), since some other EOSs, of those considered in the present\npaper, would contribute to its bandwidth.\nEven though the Schenberg spherical antenna cannot determine the\nproperties of damping time with low errors, we applied the empirical relations\nobtained by Benhar etal, as we have done before, to describe its properties,\nconsidering the NSs in which the f-mode frequency lies between 3.0-3.4 kHz.\nIn Ref.[22] the authors found an empirical relation for the f-mode damping\ntime described by\nR4\nM \u22121\n\u22122\n\u03c4f =\n(8.7 \u00b1 0.2) * 10 + (\u22120.271 \u00b1 0.009)\n(8)\ncM 3\nR\nwhere R is the radius and M is the gravitational mass, both in units of km\nand c is the speed of light, 3*105km/s. In addition to the frequency equation,\nEq.2, that gives rise to the detectable region in the mass-radius diagram,\nEq.6, we obtained the diagram drawn in Fig.2. This diagram shows that,\nin the Schenberg detectable region, the signal obtained from NSs with very\nhigh masses, M > 1.8M\u2299 , would have a damping time of, at least, 0.2s,\nwhile very low mass NSs, M < 0.5M\u2299 would have damping times \u03c4 > 0.1s.\nNSs with masses around 1M\u2299 would have a wide range of possible damping\ntimes, 0.06 \u2212 0.10s.\nAt this point the relevant questions are: what about if a detection is\ndone? What kind of information we can get from it? These are the main\nquestions of our study. We have already seen how we could determine some\nof the source properties, such as the mass and radius, and now we need to\nconsider some discussion concerning the nuclear matter equation of state to\nfind out what kind of information all of this together could give. We deal\nwith these issues in the next section.\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n4\n\nNuclear Matter Equation of State\n\nWe have seen that a possible GW detection by the Schenberg antenna would\nimpose severe constraints in the properties of its sources, e.g., the masses and\n9\n\n\f20\np-mode\n\nR (km)\n\n15\n\n10\nf-mode\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nM (MSun)\n\nFigure 1: Mass-radius relation for the Benhar etal empirical relation and for\ndifferent EOSs.

Once we have considered these constraints, we can invert\nthe problem and verify its relevance in the nuclear matter equation of state\nparameters. Some attempts have already been done in this direction [27] but\none of the purposes of this work is to study the information we can get from\nthe Brazilian detector.\nThe global properties of mass and radius of compact stars are directly\nrelated to its equation of state. In the previous section we have developed our\nanalysis in a model-independent level. Here, we go a step further and, using\na specific model for NS matter, we analyze the consequences of a detection.\nIn particular, we consider the model developed by Taurines etal [24] for a\nnew class of parameterized field-theoretical model (see figure 3) described by\nthe following lagrangian density\n\nL =\n\n1 \u22c6\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\n\u03c8\u0304B i\u03b3\u03bc (\u2202 \u03bc \u2212 g\u03c9B\n\u03c9 \u03bc ) \u2212 (MB \u2212 g\u03c3B\n\u03c3) \u2212 [ g\u033aB\n\u03c4 * \u033a\u03bc ] \u03c8B\n2\nB\n1\n1\n1\n+ (\u2202\u03bc \u03c3\u2202 \u03bc \u03c3 \u2212 m2\u03c3 \u03c3 2 ) \u2212 \u03c9\u03bc\u03bd \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd + m2\u03c9 \u03c9\u03bc \u03c9 \u03bc\n2\n4\n2\nX\n1\n1 2\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u2212 \u033a\u03bc\u03bd * \u033a + m\u033a \u033a\u03bc * \u033a +\n\u03c8\u0304l [i\u03b3\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc \u2212 Ml ]\u03c8l ,\n(9)\n4\n2\nl\n\nX\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nwhere the baryon field \u03c8B is summed over the whole baryon octet and coupled\nto the scalar and vector fields \u03c3, \u03c9 and \u033a through the parametrized coupling\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\n\u22c6\nconstants g\u03c3B\n, g\u03c9B\n, g\u033aB\n. The free lepton fields \u03c8\u03bb contributes to the eletrical\nequilibrium in the NS matter. The masses of the baryons, mesons and leptons\nare represented by MB , m\u03c3,\u03c9,\u033a and m\u03bb , respectively.\nUsing a parameterization, \u03bb, for the baryon-meson coupling constants,\ng\u03c3\u22c6 \u03c8\u0304\u03c3\u03c8 = \u0010\n\ng\u03c3 \u03c3\n1+\n\n\u0011 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\ng\u03c3 \u03c3 \u03bb\n\u03bbM\n\n(10)\n\nthis model describes a wide range of NS parameters, such as a maximum mass\nranging from (very low values) M = 0.66M\u2299 up to M = 2.77M\u2299 , and the\ncorresponding radii that vary in the range of 8 < R < 13.17 km. Each pair in\nthe mass-radius relation is associated with a different parametrization of the\nequation of state (see Ref.[24] for further details). Of course, each value of\nsuch parametrization represents different values of nuclear matter properties.\nThe study of nuclear matter properties is still a very open problem. We\nfocuse here on the problem of the determination of the compression modulus,\n12\n\n\f1e+35\n\n2\n\nP (dyn/cm )\n\n1e+34\n\n1e+33\n\n1e+32\n1e+14\n\n1e+15\n3\n\n\u03b5 (g/cm )\n\nFigure 3: Equations of State for normal nuclear matter, using the Taurines\nmodel (solid line) and NL model (dotted line), and for quark matter using\nthe Chromo-dieletric model (dot-dashed line) and MIT bag model with\nB = 60MeV /f m3 (dash-double dotted line) and with B = 100MeV /f m3\n(dot-double dashed line).\n\n13\n\n\f3\n\nM / MSun\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nK (MeV)\n\nFigure 4: The NS maximum masses versus the compression modulus,\nfor different parametrization in the Taurines etal models. The solid line\nrepresents a parametrization in the scalar mesons while the dotted line\ndescribes a parametrization in both scalar and vector contributions of the\nnuclear force.\n\nK. The compression modulus defines the curvature of the equation of state\nor, in a few words, is related to the capability of matter to be compressed.\nOne can see in figure 4 that a maximum mass of NSs is obtained for large\nvalues of the compression modulus. The definition of K reads\n\"\n\n2d\n\nK=9 \u03c1\n\n2\n\n(\u01eb/\u03c1)\nd\u03c12\n\n#\n\n(11)\n\n\u03c1=\u03c10\n\nwhere \u01eb is the energy density, \u03c1 is the baryon density and \u03c10 the baryon\nsaturation density. Actually, the acceptable values for the compression\nmodulus are constrained between 200 < K < 300MeV [28, 29].\nAn important constraint to the equations of state is to describe a family\nof NSs with a maximum mass greater than the value obtained by the most\n14\n\n\fmassive known pulsar. The PSR J0751+1807 has a mass M = 2.1 \u00b1 0.2M\u2299\n[30]. This condition has to be fulfilled by the set of parameters chosen to\ndescribe the NS model. This first condition already constrains the value\nof compression modulus to K \u2265 220MeV when this model is considered.\nSmaller values of K would lead to masses smaller than 1.9M\u2299 disagreeing\nwith the measures of PSR J0751+1807 mass.\nAssuming the detection of a f-mode, associated with a NS composed of\nnuclear matter, which we have seen as very unexpected, this would imply\na very compact NS, with high masses (> 1.8M\u2299 ) occupying a small radius,\nnamely, 9-10 km. As the maximum mass star has the smallest radius (see\nfigure 1), we look for a set of parameters which leads to the smallest radius\nfor the maximum mass star. Stellar models on which the maximum mass has\na radius R \u2264 10 km have compression modulus 215 < K < 225MeV . Stellar\nmodels with masses smaller then 2.5M\u2299 and radii greater then 10 km cannot\nbe detected by the Schenberg antenna, so, a putative detection would be\nresponsible for the most important constraint on the values of K even done\nby any earth-based nuclear experiment, namely, 220 < K < 225MeV .\nIt was already proposed the existence of low-mass NSs in LMXBs and\nHMXBs (see, e.g., Refs. [31, 32]). The detection and identification of a\np-mode wave would confirm this existence. It is worth mentioning that, as\na spherical antenna can be used to identify the direction of the source, the\ndetection could also confirm that low-mass NSs are, in fact, related to the\nLMXBs and HMXBs.\nAnother scenario to be discussed concerns the detection of an f-mode\nwhen the source is a strange quark star. The models used in this analysis\nare the MIT bag model [25] and the chromo-dielectric model [26]. The\ndetection of an f-mode wave coming from a strange star would impose new\nconstraints on the values of the bag constant B, the strange quark mass and\nthe perturbative constant \u03b1c .\nThe MIT bag model describes, as its own name suggests, that baryons\nare composed by three quarks confined inside a bag. The effects of pressure\ndifference in the interior and exterior regions of the bag are summarized in\nthe bag constant. The thermodynamical potential of quarks in the MIT bag\nmodel is described by\n\"\n\n\u03bcq + kF q\n\u22121\n5 2\n3 4\n2\n\u03a9 =\n(\u03bc\n\u2212\n\u03bc\nk\nm\n)\n+\nm\nln\nq\nF\nq\nq\nq\nq\n2\n2\n2\nmq\nq=u,d,s 4\u03c0\nX\n\n15\n\n!#\n\n\f!#2\n\n\"\n\n\u03bcq + kF q\n2\u03b1c\n[3 \u03bcq kF q \u2212 m2q \u2212 m2q ln\n+\n3\n4\u03c0\nmq\n!\n!\n\u03c1r\n4\n4 2 mq\n\u2212 2kF q \u2212 3mq ln\n+ 6ln\n[\u03bcq kF q m2q\n\u03bcq\n\u03bcq\n!\n\u03bc\n+\nk\nq\nF\nq\n\u2212 m4q ln\n]] + B\nmq\n\n(12)\n\nwhere q = u, d, s are the three quark flavors up, down and strange, \u03bcq is\nthe chemical potential, mq represents the quark masses, kq is the Fermi\nmomentum of the particles, B is the bag constant and the terms multiplied\nby \u03b1c represents the contribution of the first order perturbation in the strong\ninteraction.\nEven with considerable advances in the study of QCD (quantum chromodynamics) on the lattice, from where we expect the most reliable theoretical\nresults and the consequent advances in collision experiments, the bag\nconstant still presents a very wide range of possible values. In the same\nway, the perturbative constant, \u03b1c , the one that represents the first order\ncorrection to the strong interaction forces between quarks, also represents an\nopen issue. Astrophysical and GW experiments may provide a short-cut to\nthe determination of these values.\nWe argue that, if a GW detection is done, and identified as an f-mode\nwave coming from a strange quark star, the higher are the values of the bag\nconstant, B, the perturbative constant, \u03b1c and the strange quark mass, ms ,\nthe more compact is the star and more the model fits into the region of\nSchenberg's sensibility curve.\nThe set of constants, B = 60MeV /f m3 , \u03b1c = 0 and ms = 150MeV\ncould not describe stars that emit 3.0-3.4 kHz waves, on the other hand,\nB = 100MeV /f m3 , \u03b1c = 0.35 and ms = 200MeV would perfectly fit the\noptimum region. Our results are in perfect agreement with those found in\nRef.[27], where the higher is the value of B, the higher is the f-mode frequency.\nThe same behavior appears in the color-dieletric model when we convert\nthe parameters to obtain the corresponding values of a bag constant. These\nconstraints in the values of the bag and perturbative constants would severely\nrestrict the QCD parameters. If a detection of a strange star is done by the\nSchenberg antenna and, consequently, these values are confirmed, the hadronquark phase transition would occur in an extremely high density. Such high\ndensity would rule out the possibility of finding standard NSs with quark\n16\n\n\fcores.\nLast, but not least, we refer the reader to Fig. 2, from which we can\nconclude that the determination of the damping time could also contribute\nto constraint the parameters of the equations of state and also the star mass\nrange.\n\n5\n\nFinal remarks\n\nWe have briefly reviewed the properties of GW emission by NSs and BHs. We\nalso have seen the main characteristics of the Brazilian and Dutch spherical\nantennas.\nAssuming a possible detection of GWs coming from a NS in the range\nof 2.8-3.4 kHz, the one by Schenberg and Mini-GRAIL, we can extract\ninformation to describe the source characteristics. The identification of the\nsource could be done by means of the wave damping time, which combined\nwith the corresponding frequency, leads to the determination of the mass and\nradius of the star.\nThe determination of these values imposes important constraints on the\nnuclear and subnuclear matter equation of state, such as limiting values\nfor the compression modulus, nucleon effective mass, bag and perturbative\nconstants. As a matter of example, values like K \u2248 220MeV , B \u2248\n100MeV /f m3 and \u03b1c \u2248 0.35 would be imposed by a putative detection.\nIt is still important to mention that spherical antennas can identify the\nposition of the source in the sky, with 20o for the first stage of the Schenberg\nantenna, operating at T \u223c 4.2K and about 2o at mili-Kelvin temperatures\n[23]. This property would enable us to combine GW data with those obtained\nby observations in the electromagnetic spectra, which together could help\nidentifying the sources.\nLast but not least, a relevant question has to do with the event rate of\ndetectable oscillating modes of NSs within the Schenberg bandwidth. We\nhave seen in the introduction of the present paper that there exists a host of\npossible mechanisms to excite the oscillating modes of NSs. Many of these\nmechanisms, however, present very uncertain event rates. If the f-mode is\nexcited, for example, during the formation of the NSs, the event rate would\nbe the one related to the rate of supernovae, which for our Galaxy amounts\none event every tens of years.\nIn recent studies de Araujo etal [17, 20] consider the event rates associated\n17\n\n\fwith pulsar glitches and also in LMXBs. They argue that up to several event\nyears would be possible. We refer the reader to these studies for further\ndetails.\n\n6\n\nAknoledgments\n\nGFM and JCNA would like to thank CNPq (grants 381682/2006-4,\n303868/2004-0, respectively) for financial support.
