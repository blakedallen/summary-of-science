This is mainly due to the lack of a unified picture of\nthe underlying electronic states responsible for the nano-scale electronic inhomogeneity1 in the\ndoping-induced charge carrier (hole) distribution in the CuO2 planes. This hallmark of cuprate\nphysics is now widely, though not universally2, accepted as one of the natural consequences of\nthe electronic phase separation. One possible candidate that we proposed3 for the underlying\npristine electronic phase (PEP) responsible for the nano-scale phase separation was the 2D\nelectronic square lattices on which the itinerant holes \"ride\". Since the planar hole density (Ppl)4\nis one of the most important controlling parameters of the HTS, it is plausible to assess that the\ngeneric electronic phase diagram, in which a superconducting dome exists in a narrow range\nbetween Ppl ~ 0.06 (or 0.11) and 0.25, arises from the presence of the PEP's and their interaction\nwith the itinerant holes5.\nHence, any theoretical model built on the premise where all the holes are itinerant in the\nCuO2 planes cannot readily answer a question like \"How could HTS emerge from such highly\ninhomogeneous electronic texture?\" Consequently, theoretical interpretations to date have\noffered only a partial explanation for the data obtained by a particular experimental probe but fail\nto account for the rest observed through different probes, making numerous experimental data\nseem anomalous. Therefore, one may logically conclude that the missing key step in building the\ncorrect microscopic model is the pinning down of the origin of this ubiquitous electronic\ninhomogeneity and its role in the HTS.\nAt this point we need to bring out the two subtle but quite important experimental facts\nthat have been overlooked so far. The first is the presence of the distinct onset Ppl's for the HTS\nat Ppl ~ 0.06 (or 0.11) for the entire family of cuprate superconductors4,5. The second is the\n\n\ffinding that only a small fraction of the holes are participating in the HTS. It was found that ~\n20% of the total holes are itinerant at optimal doping6,7 and only ~ 1% in the underdoped La2x\n\nSrxCuO4+\u03b43,8,9. What is more fascinating is that the remaining 80% \u2013 99% of the holes in the\n\nCuO2 planes comprise the PEP's in the form of electronic lattices (EL's) as evidenced by the\npresence of the charge collective modes at finite frequencies and the accompanying single\nparticle excitation gap at ~ 400 cm-1, which is a direct proof that the EL's are self-organized and\npinned3,8,9.\nIn this work, we chose to study a polycrystalline La2CuO4+\u03b4 at \u03b4 = 0.0315 which\ntranslates into Ppl = 0.063, right above the onset Ppl for the HTS. Previous systematic studies of\nthe preparations and the doping efficiency of pure oxygen-doped La2CuO4+\u03b4 and oxygen and\nstrontium co-doped La2-xSrxCuO4+\u03b4 (CD-La214) polycrystalline samples found that delicate\nelectrochemical oxidation performed at an elevated temperature (T) and long time post-annealing\nare required in order to achieve the thermodynamic equilibrium state10,11. These equilibrium\nsamples have only two intrinsic superconducting transitions with Tc = 15 K and Tc = 30 K10,\nwhich is independently confirmed later12. The two intrinsic Tc = 15 K and Tc = 30 K phases are\nnot owing to the phase separation of the dopant oxygen atoms between the CuO2 planes \u2013 these\nare the energetically favored electronic states as demonstrated in the studies of the electronic\nphase diagram of pure oxygen-doped La2CuO4+\u03b4 and CD-La214 polycrystalline samples under\nhigh pressure13. Although it was in a different context, the earlier studies of the hole cluster\ndiffusion and oxygen diffusion in La2CuO4+\u03b4 as well as the electronic phase separation of the\nholes also reached the same conclusion.14\nIt was also found that depending on the cooling rate, one of the two superconducting\nphases could be selectively stabilized in La2CuO4+\u03b4 system. For instance, when the sample is\n\n\fcooled slowly down to 200 K above which the dopant oxygen atoms are highly mobile, the\nenergetically most favored Tc = 30 K superconducting state results. However, the Tc of the\nLa2CuO4+\u03b4 with Ppl \u2264 1/16, which always exhibits the Tc = 30 K superconductivity on slow\ncooling, can be brought to 15 K via quenching. Therefore, here we have a unique opportunity to\ntest whether or not the notion of the mutually exclusive competing order is indeed operating\nbehind the scene because, if they are mutually exclusive, the quenching process should induce\nEL's. Furthermore, our experiment eliminates the extrinsic disorder effects that may arise from\ntwo different samples at two different doping levels, guaranteeing that the observed changes are\nintrinsic.\nFor quenching, the sample mounted on the cold finger of a continuous liquid helium flow\ncryostat was submerged in liquid N2. The quenching from room T down to 77 K took less than 1\nminute. Once the T of the cold finger starts to drop below 77 K, the sample assembly was placed\nin the spectrometer for the reflectivity measurements. The entire procedure was done in a dry N2\ngas atmosphere. The slow cooling of the sample was performed under the normal operating\ncondition of the cryostat by adjusting the temperature step by step at the cooling rate\ndown to T = 160 K and then rapidly cooled down to T = 10 K. All the far-IR\nmeasurements were done on warming up of the sample from T = 10 K.\nThe magnetic measurements were carried out in a magnetometer and the dc conductivity\nwas measured by using a standard four-probe technique. Fig. 1a clearly shows superconductivity\nat Tc ~ 20 K upon quenching and at Tc ~ 30 K when slow-cooled. It is interesting to note that\nwhile both cases reached zero resistance, the resistivity of the quenched sample is \"lower\" than\nthat of the slow-cooled one (see Figure 1b), which is a clear indication that the quenching\nprocess creates a larger fraction of \"metallic' region corresponding to a Tc ~ 20 K. The quenched\n\n\fand slow-cooled resistivity and magnetic susceptibility data were measured by following closely\nto the quenched and slow-cooled processes of the far-IR measurements.\nThe far-IR reflectivities of the quenched and of the slow-cooled sample at various T's are\ndisplayed in Fig. 2. Overall reflectivity increases systematically with decreasing T.\n\nThe\n\nreflectivity minimum at \u03c9 ~ 15 cm-1 and the peak at \u03c9 ~ 23 cm-1 are commonly present for both\nquenched and slow-cooled sample. Also a small peak develops at \u03c9 ~ 100 cm-1 in both cases\nwith decreasing T. The intense mode at \u03c9 ~ 220 cm-1 (denoted as C in Figure 3) is the wellknown c-axis breathing mode of the apical oxygen.\n\n\u03c31(\u03c9) and \u03b51(\u03c9) calculated from the reflectivity data using a Kramers-Kronig\ntransformation3 are displayed in Fig. 3. The origin of the reflectivity minimum in both the slowcooled and the quenched sample at \u03c9 ~ 15 cm-1 becomes clear; this is the characteristic of the\nplasma behavior of the free carriers in the system. The small value of \u03c9p suggests that the ratio of\nthe free hole density to the hole mass is extremely small. In the \u03c31(\u03c9) plot for the quenched\nsample, the two peaks indicated as G1 and P develop as T is lowered below 300 K and there also\ndevelop a broad structure between the G1 and P modes.\nUpon slow cooling, in addition to the G1 and P modes observed in the quenched sample,\ntwo new modes (G2 at \u03c9 ~ 43 cm-1 and G3 at \u03c9 ~ 62 cm-1) emerge out of the broad structure and\nthe Tc = 30 K superconductivity results. Thus, one may conclude that the development of the G2\n(and G3) mode must be related to the Tc = 30 K superconductivity. In fact, the previous far-IR\nstudies of the CD-La2143 found that the development of the G2 peak is essential for having the Tc\n= 30 K superconductivity and it was suggested that this G2 mode is the charge collective mode of\nthe c(2x2) EL.3,8 The single particle excitation gap 2\u0394 ~ 400 cm-1 (50 meV) for both quenched\nand slow-cooled sample was estimated from the zero-crossing in \u03b51(\u03c9). However, this zero-\n\n\fcrossing frequency must be higher than the actual zero-crossing of the gap because of the extra\nnegative contributions to \u03b51(\u03c9) by the phonons. Notice that there is a discrepancy in the\nreflectivity obtained at 300 K under the quenched and the slow-cooled conditions (see Fig. 2).\nThis is because it takes a substantial amount of time to \"anneal away\" the localized carriers in\nthe EL sites even at room T once the EL's are formed.\nThe development of the P mode upon doping along with the G modes deserves special\nattention because, although the P mode appears as a weak mode in the polycrystalline sample,\nthis mode is dominating the in-plane \u03c31(\u03c9) of single crystalline La2-xSrxCuO49,15. As shown in\nFig. 4, direct comparison reveals that the P mode seen in the polycrystalline La2CuO4.0315 is a\nsuperposition of the two modes, one (Z mode) at ~ 100 cm\u20131 which develops at low T and the\nother (X1 mode) at ~ 110 cm-1 at low T which is red-shifted from ~ 140 cm-1 at room T. This Z\nmode must be related to the charge dynamics along the c-axis because it is absent in the in-plane\n\u03c31(\u03c9) of the single crystal sample. There also commonly presents a weaker but sharper mode at ~\n360 cm-1 indicated as X2.\nThese Z, X1 and X2 modes also appear in the Raman studies16,17. Lack of oxygen isotope\neffect on the Z mode and the X1 mode in the Raman spectra16 suggests that these are related to\nthe motion of the La/Sr atom connected to the apical oxygen atom of each octahedron. The Z\nmode is highly polarized along the c-axis and the X1 and X2 modes are highly polarized along the\nCuO2 plane. However the X2 mode follows the mass harmonic law upon oxygen isotope\nsubstitution meaning that it is related to the apical oxygen vibration mode parallel to the CuO2\nplane16. It was also found that these Z, X1 and X2 modes developed only for the Ppl range between\n0.03 and 0.27, consistent with the far-IR observation. The Raman intensities of these modes\n\n\fmainly depended on the amount of doping and the local lattice distortions induced by doping,\nsuggesting that the inversion symmetry breaking takes place due to the EL formation17.\nThe asymmetric line shape of the X1 mode is due to the Fano-type coupling18, clearly\nindicating the strong phonon\u2013EL interaction. The linewidth of X1 mode in the polycrystalline\nsample (~ 8 cm-1) is much narrower than that of the single crystalline sample (~ 40 cm-1) at low\nT, suggesting that the degree of electronic disorder in the single crystalline sample is much more\nsevere as pointed out in Ref.[9]. We point out that the ratio of the oscillator strength of the X1\nmode of the polycrystalline sample to that of the single crystalline sample is ~ 0.02. In other\nwords, the spectral contribution of the CuO2 plane to the reflectivity of the polycrystalline\nsample is only ~ 2%. Since the X1 mode is highly in-plane polarized, it is expected to be more\ndominating the in-plane \u03c31(\u03c9) of the single crystalline sample as the angle of incidence\napproaches the normal incidence9,15.\nOne-dimensional (1D) charge stripe order as the topology of the EL in the La2x\n\nSrxCuO4+\u03b4 system was proposed based on the neutron study of La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 at Ppl ~ 1/8.19\n\nSince superconductivity in La2-xSrxCuO4+\u03b4 is suppressed at Ppl ~ 1/8, this was attributed to the\ncharge stripe formation at Ppl ~ 1/8. Then, according to this scenario, the static charge stripes\nmust melt or become dynamic to bring about the HTS, which implies the diminishing of the\noscillator strength of EL modes away from Ppl ~ 1/8. This is not what has been seen in this work.\nThe previous electrochemical doping studies and the far-IR studies of La2-xSrxCuO4+\u03b4 led\nus to conclude that the PEP formed at Ppl ~ 0.06 corresponds to a 2D EL of p(4x4) symmetry\nwhere Ppl = 1/16 = 0.0625 which supports the Tc = 15 K superconductivity. Upon further\nincreasing the Ppl the 2D EL of c(2x2) symmetry (Ppl = 1/8 = 0.125) emerges and the Tc = 30 K\nsuperconductivity results. Indeed, recent experimental evidences seem to agree with this\n\n\fobservation that the intrinsic Tc's of the HTS is tied to specific PEP's of Ppl = 1/16 (= 1/42), 1/8\n(= 2/42), 1/9 (= 1/32), 3/16 (= 3/42), and 1/4 (= 4/42), which naturally leads to the 2D EL's20.\nHowever, the far-IR evidence for the 2D nature of the EL was deduced from the line shape of the\nsingle particle excitation peak that lacks the characteristics of the 1D EL3.\nIn principle it is possible to test the dimensionality of the EL's by measuring the far-IR\nin-plane anisotropy. This has not been feasible for our polycrystalline samples and even for\nsingle crystalline samples because of the twinning problem. Fortunately, Padilla et al21 reported\ndetailed far-IR studies of the de-twinned La2-xSrxCuO4 single crystals as a function of doping for\ntwo polarizations, one along the a-axis and the other along the b-axis of the CuO2 plane. They\nobserved the broad peak at ~ 110 cm-1 in both directions22. This broad peak at ~ 110 cm-1 is the\ncharge-induced X1 mode described in this paper and its strength is already dominating even at ~\n4% doping. Therefore, there is no intrinsic anisotropy in the in-plane far-IR spectra and the EL is\nindeed 2D in nature.\nIn light of the two intrinsic superconducting phases (Tc = 15 K and Tc = 30 K) observed in\nthe La2CuO4+\u03b4 in thermal equilibrium, one may conclude that the Tc = 20 K superconducting state\nobserved in the quenched sample is an admixture of the Tc = 15 K phase and of the Tc = 30 K\nphase. Hence the G2 mode (and G3 mode) is also present in the quenched sample but they appear\nas a broad bump. Upon slow-cooling, the G2 mode dominates and the Tc = 30 K state is obtained.\nHowever we believe that the long-range order of the Ppl = 3/16 EL of the G3 mode, which should\ncorrespond to the Tc = 45 K phase, was not fully developed to support the Tc = 45 K\nsuperconductivity23 and must have been present in the form of small disconnected patches in the\nCuO2 planes.\n\n\fIn conclusion, we have verified the 2D nature of the EL through detailed analysis of the\ncharge-induced infrared modes. Our observation is contrary not only to the notion of the\nmutually exclusive competing order but also to the 1D static/dynamic charge stripe order as the\ntopology of the EL. In this work, we have identified for the first time the physical origin of the\nmysterious intense structure at ~ 110 cm-1 that has been misunderstood as a charge stripe related\nstructure.24 We have demonstrated that the presence of 2D EL is essential for the appearance of\nthe HTS. The severe electronic disorder in the single crystalline sample suggests mixing of the\ndisordered EL's of various symmetries9. We anticipate, therefore, inhomogeneous local gaps in\nthe STM experiments since the so-called pseudo gap is the single particle excitation gap of an\nEL25. The STM observation of the co-existence of 100% coverage of the nano-scale\ninhomogeneous local gaps with HTS26 and the non-competing nature of the pseudo gap against\nHTS27 is consistent with our composite picture of a small amount of free carriers moving on the\nmixed 2D EL's that form the condensate below Tc 28.\n\nWe thank Z.

We believe that the sharp mode observed at ~ 100 cm-1 in Ref. 21 at 4% doping shares the\nsame physical origin as the ~ 100 cm-1 mode also seen at 0% doping. The presence of this\nmode at 4% doping is due to the doping inhomogeneity. Notice that the sharp peak at ~\n100 cm-1 appear only along the a-axis on top of the 110 cm-1 broad peak which is present\nin both a- and b-axis directions (see the text). This ~ 100 cm-1 peak should disappear as\nthe doping increases and the dopant distribution becomes more uniform.\n23. Y.H. Kim, Y.S. Song, and P.H. Hor (to be published).\n24. M. Dumm, S. Komiya, Y.

However because of the coexistence of the EL's, the ~ 400\ncm-1 gap always appears as an onset of the gap in far-IR.\n26. K.K. Gomes, A.N. Pasupathy, A. Pushp, S. Ono, Y. Ando, and A. Yazdani, Nature 447,\n569 (2007). It is clearly shown in Fig. 5 that bulk superconductivity is realized when the\nCuO2 plane is completely covered by the inhomogeneous local gaps.\n27. K.K.
