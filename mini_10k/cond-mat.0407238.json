A few authors\n(see, for example [12, 13, 14, 15]) explored a view that\nthe extension of the BCS theory towards the strong interaction between electrons and ion vibrations describes\nthe phenomenon. In this regime, pairing takes place in\nreal space due to a polaron collapse of the Fermi energy [16], or due to a low density of carriers. At first\nsight, bipolarons have a mass too large to be mobile.\nIndeed, Anderson [17] introduced small bipolarons as entirely localised objects explaining some unusual properties of chalcogenide glasses. However, it has been shown\nmore recently that the inclusion of the on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion leads to the favoured binding of intersite carriers [18, 19]. The intersite bipolarons can tunnel with an\neffective mass of about 10 electron masses [15, 18, 19, 20],\nand account for a high critical temperature [21].\nSoon after Anderson [17] and Street and Mott [22]\nintroduced localized pairs in amorphous semiconductors, a two component model of negative U centers coupled with the Fermi sea of itinerant fermions was employed to study superconductivity in disordered metalsemiconductor alloys [23, 24]. When the attractive potential U is large, the model is reduced to localized hardcore bosons spontaneously decaying into itinerant electrons and vice versa, different from a non-converting mixture of mobile charged bosons and fermions [25, 26]. This\nboson-fermion model (BFM) was applied more generally\nto describe pairing electron processes with localizationdelocalization [27], and a linear resistivity in the normal\nstate of cuprates [28]. The model attracted more attention in connection with high-temperature superconduc-\n\ntors [10, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], as an alternative to the bipolaron model of cuprates with intrincically mobile bipolarons [39]. In particular, Refs. [36, 37]\nclaimed that 2D BFM with immobile hard-core bosons\nis capable to reproduce some physical properties and the\nphase diagram of cuprates. BFM has been also adopted\nfor a description of superfluidity of atomic fermions scattered into bound (molecular) states [40].\nMost studies of BFM below its transition into a lowtemperature condensed phase applied a mean-field approximation (MFA), replacing zero-momentum boson operators by c-numbers and neglecting the boson selfenergy in the density sum rule [29, 30, 32, 33, 36, 37,\n38, 40]. When the bare boson energy is well above the\nchemical potential, the BCS ground state was found with\nbosons being only virtually excited [29, 30]. MFA led to\na conclusion that BFM exhibits features compatible with\nBCS characteristics [32], and describes a crossover from\nthe BCS-like to local pair behaviour [38]. The transition\nwas found more mean-field-like than the usual Bose condensation, i.e. characterized by a relatively small value\nof the fluctuation parameter Gi [33].\nAt the same time our previous study of BFM [34] beyond MFA revealed a crucial effect of the boson selfenergy on the normal state boson spectral function and\nthe transition temperature Tc . Ref.[34] proved that the\nCooper pairing of fermions via virtual bosonic states\nis impossible in any-dimensional BFM. It occurs only\nsimultaneously with the Bose-Einstein condensation of\nreal bosons. The origin of this simultaneous condensation lies in a softening of the boson mode at T = Tc\ncaused by its hybridization with fermions. The energy\nof zero-momentum bosons is renormalized down to zero\nat T = Tc , no matter how weak the boson-fermion coupling and how large the bare boson energy are [34]. One\ncan also expect that the boson self-energy should qualitatively modify the phase transition and the whole con-\n\n\f2\ndensed phase of BFM below Tc .\nIn this paper the phase transition and the condensed\nstate of BFM are examined beyond the ordinary meanfield approximation in two and three dimensions. It is\nshown that Tc = 0 K in the two-dimensional model, even\nin the absence of any Coulomb repulsion, and the phase\ntransition is never a BCS-like second-order phase transition even in 3D BFM because of the complete boson\nsoftening. A closed set of equations for fermion and boson Green's functions (GFs) is derived taking into account the self-energy effects in the condensed state of 3D\nBFM. There exist a boson pair condensate along with\nthe fermion Cooper pair and the single-particle boson\ncondensate in the model. Remarkably, the Gor'kov expansion [41] of GFs in the strength of the order parameter\nyields a zero linear term at any temperature below Tc ,\nand zero upper critical field.\nII. NO COOPER PAIRING AND\nCONDENSATION IN 2D BFM\n\nfermion vertex part in the Cooper channel one can prove\nthat this equation is perfectly correct even beyond the\nconventional non-crossing approximation [34]. The problem with MFA does not stem from this BSC-like equation, but from an incorrect definition of the bare boson\nenergy with respect to the chemical potential, E0 (T ).\nThis energy is determined by the atomic density of\nbosons (nB ) as (Eq.(9) in Ref. [36])\ntanh\n\ngN\n\nX\n\n\u03c6k b\u2020q c\u2212k+q/2,\u2191 ck+q/2,\u2193\n\nq,k\n\n\u0001\n+ H.c. ,\n\nwhere \u03bek = \u22122t(cos kx + cos ky ) \u2212 \u03bc is the 2D energy\nspectrum of fermions, E0 \u2261 \u2206B \u2212 2\u03bc is the bare boson\nenergy with respect to their chemical potential 2\u03bc, g is\nthe magnitude of the anisotropic hybridization interaction, \u03c6k = \u03c6\u2212k is the anisotropy factor, and N is the\nnumber of cells. Here and further I take ~ = c = kB = 1\nand the lattice constant a = 1. Ref. [36] argued that\n'superconductivity is induced in this model from the\nanisotropic charge-exchange interaction (g\u03c6k ) between\nthe conduction-band fermions and the immobile hardcore bosons', and 'the on-site Coulomb repulsion competes with this pairing' reducing the critical temperature\nTc less than by 25%. Also it has been argued [37], that\nthe calculated upper critical field of the model fits well\nthe experimental results in cuprates.\nHere I show that Tc = 0 K in the two-dimensional\nmodel, Eq.(1), even in the absence of any Coulomb repulsion, and the mean-field approximation is meaningless\nfor any-dimensional BFM because of the complete boson\nsoftening.\nReplacing boson operators by c-numbers for q = 0 in\nEq.(1) one obtains a linearised BCS-like equation for the\nfermion order-parameter (the gap function) \u2206k ,\n\u2206k =\n\n1 \u2212 2nB\ni\u03a9 \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03a3b (q, \u03a9)\n\n(4)\n\none must replace incorrect Eq.(3) by\n\nq\n\nk,\u03c3=\u2191,\u2193\n\n\u22121/2\n\n(1)\n\n(3)\n\nWhile Eq.(2) is correct, Eq.(3) is incorrect because the\nboson self-energy \u03a3b (q, \u03a9) due to the same hybridization\ninteraction is missing. At first sight [36] the self-energy\nis small in comparison to the kinetic energy of fermions,\nif g is small. However \u03a3b (0, 0) diverges logarithmically\nat zero temperature [34], no matter how week the interaction is. Therefore it should be kept in the density\nsum-rule, Eq.(3).

However, increasing dimensionality does not\nmake MFA a meaningful approximation for the bosonfermion model. This approximation leads to a naive\nconclusion that a BCS-like superconducting state occurs below the critical temperature Tc \u2243 \u03bc exp (\u2212E0 /zc )\nvia fermion pairs being virtually excited into unoccupied\nbosonic states [29, 30]. Here zc = g\u0303 2 N (0) and N (0) is the\ndensity of states (DOS) in the fermionic band near the\nFermi level \u03bc. However, the Cooper pairing of fermions is\nimpossible via virtual unoccupied bosonic states also in\n3D BFM. Indeed, Eqs.(2,8) do not depend on the dimensionality, so that the analytical continuation of Eq.(4)\nto real frequencies \u03c9 yields the partial boson DOS as\n\u03c1(\u03c9) = (1 \u2212 2nB )\u03b4(\u03c9) at T = Tc and q = 0 in anydimensional BFM. The Cooper pairing may occur only\nsimultaneously with the Bose-Einstein condensation of\nreal bosons in the exact theory of 3D BFM [34]. The\norigin of the simultaneous condensation of the fermionic\nand bosonic fields in 3D BFM lies in the softening of the\nboson mode at T = Tc caused by its hybridization with\nfermions.\nTaking into account the boson damping and dispersion\nshows that the boson spectrum significantly changes for\nall momenta. Continuing the self-energy, Eq.(6) to real\nfrequencies yields the damping (i.e. the imaginary part\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03be = vF /(4Tc ) is a coherence length, and vF is\nthe Fermi velocity. The damping is significant when\nq\u03be << 1. In this region \u03b3(q, \u03c9) = \u03c9\u03c0zc /(8Tc) is comparable or even larger than the boson energy \u03c9. Hence\nbosons look like overdamped diffusive modes, rather than\nquasiparticles in the long-wave limit [34, 35], contrary to\nthe erroneous conclusion of Ref.[31], that there is 'the\nonset of coherent free-particle-like motion of the bosons'\nin this limit. Only outside the long-wave region, the\ndamping becomes small. Indeed, using Eq.(10) one obtains \u03b3(q, \u03c9) = \u03c9\u03c0zc /(2qvF ) << \u03c9, so that bosons at\nq >> 1/\u03be are well defined quasiparticles with a logarithmic dispersion, \u03c9(q) = zc ln(q\u03be) [34]. Hence the boson\nenergy disperses over the whole energy interval from zero\nup to E0 .\nThe main mathematical problem with MFA in 3D also\nstems from the density sum rule, Eq.(5) which determines\nthe chemical potential of the system and consequently\nthe bare boson energy E0 (T ) as a function of temperature. In the framework of MFA one takes the bare boson\nenergy in Eq.(2) as a temperature independent parameter, E0 = g\u0303 2 N (0) ln(\u03bc/Tc ) [33], or determines it from\nthe conservation of the total number of particles neglecting the boson self-energy, Eq.(3) [30, 36, 38, 40]. Then\nEq.(2) looks like the conventional linearized GinzburgLandau-Gor'kov equation [41] with a negative coefficient\n\u03b1 \u221d T \u2212 Tc at T < Tc in the linear term. Then\none concludes that the phase transition is almost the\nconventional BCS-like transition, at least at E0 \u226b Tc\n[29, 30, 33]. These findings are mathematically and physically erroneous. Indeed, the term of the sum in Eq.(5)\nwith \u03a9n = 0 is given by the integral\nZ\ndq\n1\nT\n.\n(11)\n2\u03c0 3 E0 + \u03a3b (q, 0)\nThe integral converges, if and only if E0 > \u2212\u03a3b (0, 0). In\nfact,\nE0 + \u03a3b (0, 0) = 0\n\n(12)\n\nis strictly zero in the Bose-condensed state, because\n\u03bcb = \u2212[E0 + \u03a3b (0, 0)] corresponds to the boson chemical\npotential relative to the lower edge of the boson energy\nspectrum. More generally, \u03bcb = 0 corresponds to the\nappearance of the Bogoliubov-Goldstone mode due to a\nbroken symmetry below Tc . This exact result makes the\nBSC equation (2) simply an identity [34] with \u03b1(T ) \u2261 0\nat any temperature below Tc . On the other hand, MFA\nviolates the density sum-rule, predicting the wrong negative \u03b1(T ) below Tc .\nSince \u03b1(T ) = 0, one may expect that the conventional\nupper critical field, Hc2 (T ) is zero in BFM. To determine\nHc2 (T ) and explore the condensed phase of 3D BFM, one\ncan apply the Gor'kov formalism [41], as described below.\n\n\f4\nIII.

(16)\n\u2212\n\u2202\u03c4\n\nThe theory of the condensed state can be formulated with the normal and anomalous fermion GFs\n[41], G(r, r\u2032 , \u03c4 ) = \u2212hT\u03c4 \u03c8s (r, \u03c4 )\u03c8\u0304s (r\u2032 ,0)i, F + (r, r\u2032 , \u03c4 ) =\nhT\u03c4 \u03c8\u0304\u2193 (r,\u03c4 )\u03c8\u0304\u2191 (r\u2032 , 0)i, respectively, where the operation T\u03c4\nperforms the time ordering. Fermionic and bosonic fields\ncondense simalteneously [34]. Following Bogoliubov [42]\nthe bosonic condensate is described by separating a large\nmatrix element \u03c60 (r) in \u03c6(r, \u03c4 ) as a number, while the\nremaining part \u03c6\u0303(r, \u03c4 ) describes a supracondensate field,\n\u03c6(r, \u03c4 ) = \u03c60 (r) + \u03c6\u0303(r, \u03c4 ). Then using Eq.(16) one obtains\ng2\ng\u03c60 (r) = \u2206(r) \u2261 \u2212 F (r, r, 0+),\nE0\n\n(17)\n\nwhere F (r, r\u2032 , \u03c4 ) = hT\u03c4 \u03c8\u2193 (r,\u03c4 )\u03c8\u2191 (r\u2032 , 0)i. The equations\nfor GFs are obtained by using Eqs. (14-16) and the diagrammatic technique [43] in the framework of the noncrossing approximation [44], as shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3.\nAn important novel feature of BFM is a pairing of\nsupracondensate bosons, caused by their hybridization\nwith the fermionic condensate, as follows from the last\ndiagram in Fig.3. Hence, one has to introduce an\nanomalous supracondensate boson GF, B + (r, r\u2032 , \u03c4 ) =\n \u0304\n \u0304 \u2032 , 0)i along with the normal boson GF,\n)\u03c6\u0303(r\nhT\u03c4 \u03c6\u0303(r,\u03c4\n \u0304 \u2032 ,0)i.

Then the fermion normal and\nanomalous GFs, Eqs.(20,21) look like the familiar GFs of\nthe BCS theory, and one can apply the Gor'kov expansion\n[41] in powers of \u2206(r) to describe the condensed phase\nof BFM in the magnetic field near the transition.

In fact, the transition is driven by the Bose-Einstein condensation of real\nbosons with q = 0, which occur due to the complete softening of their spectrum at Tc . Remarkably, the conventional upper critical field, determined as the field, where\na non-trivial solution of the linearised Gor'kov equation\n(29) occurs, is zero in BFM, Hc2 (T ) = 0.
