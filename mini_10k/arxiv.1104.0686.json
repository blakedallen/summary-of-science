In this work we derive a modified SCET Lagrangian applicable in both classes of gauges:\nregular and singular ones. This extends the range of applicability of SCET. The new Lagrangian\nmust be used to obtain factorization theorems in cases where the transverse momenta of the particles\nin the final states are not integrated over, such as semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, DrellYan and the Higgs production cross-section at low transverse momentum. By doing so all nonperturbative matrix elements appearing in the factorized cross-sections are gauge invariant.\n\nIn recent years Soft-Collinear Effective Theory\n(SCET) [1, 2] has emerged as an important tool to describe jet-like events ranging from heavy quark hadronic\ndecays to Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics. The\nadvantage of this effective theory of QCD is that it incorporates, at the Lagrangian level, all the kinetic symmetries of a particular jet-like event. The fields in SCET\nare either collinear, anti-collinear or soft (low energetic)\ndepending whether they carry most of their energy along\na light-like vector (n, n2 = 0), an anti-light-like vector\n(n\u0304, n\u03042 = 0, nn\u0304 = 2) or if the energy is soft and radiated isotropically. The current formulation of SCET\nis rather limited to a class of regular gauges. In this\nclass of gauges the gauge boson fields vanish at infinity\nin coordinate space, thus no gauge transformation can\nbe performed at that point. This limitation has a rather\nimportant implications as we discuss below. Moreover,\nusing a singular gauge like the light-cone gauge (LCG),\nit is possible to improve the symmetry of the effective\nLagrangian(s) because the gauge fixing conditions also\nrespect the symmetry of the jet-like event.\nIn a previous work [3] it was argued that by extending\nthe formulation of SCET to the class of singular gauges, a\nnew Wilson line, the T -Wilson line, has to be invoked as a\nbasic SCET building block. The T -Wilson line discussed\nin [3]\u2013which is exactly 1 in covariant gauge\u2013is built using LCG ghost field An\u22a5 (x+ , \u221e\u2212 , x\u22a5 ). This transverse\nWilson line allows for a complete gauge invariant definitions of the non-perturbative matrix elements of collinear\nparticles to be obtained from first principles, it allows\n\nto properly factorize high-energy processes with explicit\ntransverse-momentum dependence and it reads 1 ,\n\u0015\n\u0014 Z \u221e\nd\u03c4 l\u22a5 * An\u22a5 (x+ , \u221e\u2212 , x\u22a5 \u2212 l\u22a5 \u03c4 ) ,\nTn = P\u0304 exp ig\n0\n\n(1)\nwhere P\u0304 stands for anti-path ordering. Below we discuss\nalso the transverse Wilson lines built from soft gluons\nwhich allows for a gauge invariant definitions of soft matrix elements with transverse space separation.\nIn this work we show how to implement the T -Wilson\nline at the level of the soft-collinear Lagrangians. The\nresults obtained (see below) are Lagrangians applicable\nin covariant gauges as well as in light-cone gauge (LCG)\nboth in SCET-I and in SCET-II. This in turn will enable\nus to explicitly invoke the transverse-momentum dependence to the collinear quark and gluon jets. Those latter quantities form the fundamental blocks for the nonperturbative matrix elements like transverse-momentum\ndependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs),\nbeam-functions (BFs) [4] and the like [5, 6] .\nWe start the discussion with the LCG: n\u0304A = A+ =\n0, n\u03042 = 0. QCD can be canonically quantized in this\ngauge [7] and the quantization fixes the Feynman rules for\nthe gauge bosons with the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt (ML)\nprescription [8]. Passing from QCD to SCET however\nsome new issues arise. For instance, in QCD one needs\nto specify one gauge fixing condition. In the effective\ntheory however every light-cone (LC) direction defines a\ncollinear gauge sector and it is not clear, beforehand, how\nthe gauge fixing conditions respect the power counting of\nthe different collinear sectors.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: miguel.gechevarria@fis.ucm.es\naddress: ahmadidilbi@gmail.com\n\u2021 Electronic address: ignazios@fis.ucm.es\n\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n1\n\nIn this paper we have adapted our convention for Wilson lines to\nthe one of Ref. [1]. This is consistent with the results of Ref. [3].\n\n\f2\nIn the following we show how LCG can be implemented\nboth in collinear and soft sectors of SCET. In particular we study in which cases LCG is compatible with\npower counting and \"multipole expansion\" in SCET-I\nand SCET-II. First (in sec. I) we illustrate the origin\nof the T -Wilson line from full QCD. Then we explicitly\nshow how the T -Wilson line appears in the SCET Lagrangians. This result is the main result of this paper:\nFor the (leading order) SCET Lagrangians and the basic building-blocks to be gauge invariant in covariant as\nwell as in LCG, transverse gauge links have to be introduced in SCET-I and in SCET-II. In sec. II we discuss\nthe applications of those results then we conclude.\nI.\n\nTHE QCD AND SCET LAGRANGIANS IN LC\nGAUGE: T-WILSON LINES\n\nIn this chapter we want to write the SCET matter\nLagrangian in LCG outlining the role of ghost fields in\nLCG. First we recall some of the features of the gluon\nfields in QCD in LCG from Ref. [7]. To fix matters, we\nwork in QCD with the gauge fixing condition n\u0304A = 0.\nThe canonical quantization of the gluon field proceeds by\ninserting in the Lagrangian the gauge fixing term Lgf =\n\u039ba (n\u0304Aa ). The \u039ba is a field whose value on the Hilbert\nspace of physical states is equal to zero. It is possible to\nwrite the most general solution of the equation of motion\nof the boson field Aa\u03bc via decomposing it into\nAa\u03bc (k) = T\u03bca (k)\u03b4(k 2 ) + n\u0304\u03bc\n+\n\n\u03b4(n\u0304k) a\n2 \u039b (nk, k\u22a5 )\nk\u22a5\n\nik\u03bc\na\n2 \u03b4(n\u0304k)U (nk, k\u22a5 ) ,\nk\u22a5\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the field T\u03bca is such that n\u0304\u03bc T\u03bca (k) = 0 and\nk \u03bc T\u03bca (k) = 0. Fourier transforming this expression we\nsee that in general the field Aa\u03bc (x) has non-vanishing \"\u2212\"\nand \"\u22a5\" (respectively nAa (x) and A\u03bc,a\n\u22a5 (x)) components\nwhen x\u2212 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. We define\ndef\n\nA(\u221e) (x+ , x\u22a5 ) = A(x+ , \u221e\u2212 , x\u22a5 )\n+\n\n\u2212\n\ndef\n\n+\n\n(3)\n(\u221e)\n\n\u2212\n\n\u00c3(x , x , x\u22a5 ) = A(x , x , x\u22a5 ) \u2212 A\n\n+\n\n(x , x\u22a5 )\n\nThen we have the following relation:\n(\u221e) def\n\niD\n/\u22a5 = i\u2202/\u22a5 + gA\n/\u22a5 = i\u2202/\u22a5 + g \u00c3\n/\u22a5 + gA\n/\u22a5\n\n(\u221e)\n\n= iD\u0303\n/\u22a5 + gA\n/\u22a5\n(4)\n\nand we can show that\niD\n/\u22a5 = T iD\u0303\n/\u22a5 T \u2020 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\u0014\nZ\nT = P exp \u2212ig\n\u2020\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c4 l\u22a5 *\n\n(\u221e)\nA\u22a5 (x+ , x\u22a5\n\n\u0015\n\u2212 l\u22a5 \u03c4 )\n\n(6)\n\n(\u221e)\n\nand we use that in Eq. (5) the fields \u00c3\u22a5 and A\u22a5 are\nevaluated at space-like separated points. The proof of\nthis equation leads us automatically to the inclusion of\nthe T -Wilson line in the Lagrangian. We write\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\n(\u221e)\nd\u03c4 l\u22a5 A\u22a5 (x+ , x\u22a5 \u2212 \u03c4 l\u22a5 )\nil\u22a5 \u2202\u22a5 T \u2020 = iT \u2020 l\u22a5 \u2202\u22a5 \u2212ig\n0\nZ \u221e Z\nd4 k\n(\u221e)\n\u2020\n(il\u22a5 k\u22a5 ) l\u22a5 A\u22a5 (k)\n= gT\nd\u03c4\n4\n(2\u03c0)\n0\n(\u221e)\n\n\u00d7 eik(x\u2212l\u22a5 \u03c4 ) = gT \u2020 l\u22a5 A\u22a5 (x+ , x\u22a5 ),\n\n(7)\n\nwhich proves Eq. (5), as l\u22a5 is an arbitrary vector.\nMoreover 1/n\u0304\u2202 and T commute because\nthe T -Wilson line does not depend on x\u2212 .\nUn(\u221e)\nder gauge transformation \u03b4A\u03bc\u22a5 = D\u03bc\u22a5 \u03c9 one has\nT (x+ , x\u22a5 ) \u2192 U (x+ , x\u22a5 )T (x+ , x\u22a5 )U \u2020 (x+ , x\u22a5 \u2212 l\u22a5 \u221e) =\n(\u221e)\nU (x+ , x\u22a5 )T (x+ , x\u22a5 ) since A\u03bc\u22a5 (x+ , \u221e\u22a5 ) = 0. Notice\nalso that the T -Wilson lines are independent of l\u22a5 .\nNow we split the fermion field into big and small components using the usual projectors n\n/n\u0304\n//4 and n\u0304\n/n\n//4 and\neliminate the small components using the equations of\nmotion [1]. The result of this is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nn\u0304\n/\n/\u22a5\nL = \u03be \u0304n inD + iD\niD\n/\u22a5\n\u03ben .\n(8)\nin\u0304D\n2\nIn QCD in LCG with the gauge condition n\u0304A = 0,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn\u0304\n/\n1\niD\u0303\n/\u22a5 T \u2020\n\u03ben .\n/\u22a5\nL = \u03be\u0304n inD + T iD\u0303\nin\u0304\u2202\n2\n\n(9)\n\nIn order to get the SCET Lagrangian we must implement\nmultipole expansion and power counting on the fields\nthat appear in Eq. (8). In SCET we have also the freedom\nto choose a different gauge in the different sectors of the\ntheory. We distinguish the cases of SCET-I and SCETII. The two formulations differ essentially in the scaling\nof the soft sector of the theory. In SCET-I, collinear\nfields describe particles whose momentum k scales like\n(n\u0304k, nk, k\u22a5 ) \u223c Q(1, \u03bb2 , \u03bb) where \u03bb \u226a 1 and Q is a hard\nenergy scale. Also the components of the collinear gluons,\nA\u03bcn , in SCET-I (n\u0304An , nAn , An\u22a5 ) scale like \u223c (1, \u03bb2 , \u03bb).\nThe scaling of ultra-soft (u-soft) momenta in SCET-I is \u223c\nQ(\u03bb2 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb2 ) and u-soft gluon fields (n\u0304Aus , nAus , Aus\u22a5 )\nscale as \u223c (\u03bb2 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb2 ). In SCET-II we have for collinear\nfield: (n\u0304k, nk, k\u22a5 ) \u223c Q(1, \u03b7 2 , \u03b7) where \u03b7 \u226a 1. For soft\nmomentum: (n\u0304k, nk, k\u22a5 ) \u223c Q(\u03b7, \u03b7, \u03b7) and collinear (soft)\ngluons field components scale accordingly. The main difference is that in SCET-I all the components of the soft\nmomentum scale like the small component of the collinear\nfields, while in SCET-II the soft modes scale like the\ntransverse component of the collinear fields.\nSCET-I. Consider first the case of SCET-I where the\nu-soft sector is treated in covariant gauge while the LCG\n\n\f3\nis imposed on the collinear gauge fields. In LCG: n\u0304An =\n0 and with the multipole expansion [1] of Eq. (8) gives\n\u0011 n\u0304\n\u0010\n/\n1\niD\u0303\n/n\u22a5 Tn\u2020 \u03ben ,\n/n\u22a5\nLI = \u03be \u0304n inDn + gnAus (x+ ) + Tn iD\u0303\nin\u0304\u2202\n2\n(10)\nwhere iDn\u03bc = i\u2202 \u03bc + gA\u03bcn , the u-soft field depends on\nx+ (transverse and collinear variations of the u-soft field\nare power suppressed) and the T -Wilson line is given in\nEq. (1). The presence of the T -Wilson line is essential to\nhave gauge invariance as was shown in Ref. [3]. Let us\ndecide now to impose LCG also on the u-soft sector of the\ntheory, nAus = 0. The corresponding T -Wilson line that\nwould arise, following Eq. (8) disappears due to multipole\nexpansion and power counting. In fact u-soft fields cannot depend on transverse coordinates in the leading order\nLagrangian of SCET-I. In other words the T -Wilson line\nfor u-soft fields breaks the power counting of SCET-I and\nso the u-soft part of SCET-I cannot be written in LCG.\nThe other possible choice n\u0304Aus = 0 has no impact on the\nleading order SCET Lagrangian. Thus the most general\nformula for the SCET-I Lagrangian is (WnT = Tn Wn )\n\u0010\nLI = \u03be\u0304n inDn + gnAus (x+ )\n\u0011 n\u0304\n/\n1\nWnT \u2020 iD\n/n\u22a5 \u03ben .\n+ iD\n/n\u22a5WnT\nin\u0304\u2202\n2\n\n(11)\n\nSCET-II. The analysis of the collinear sector in\nSCET-II is the same as for SCET-I. In the soft sector however one has new features. In regular gauges\nsoft particles do not interact with collinear particles\nbecause the interactions knock the collinear fields offshell. This is also true in LCG except when one makes\nthe choice nAs = 0 (take here a covariant gauge for\ncollinear fields for fixing ideas). It is easy to be convinced\nQ\n\u2212\n\u22a5\nthat interactions like i \u03c6in (x)A\u221e\ns\u22a5 (x , x ), where here\ni\n\"\u221e\" refers to the + direction and \u03c6n (x) are generic\ncollinear fields, preserve the on-shellness of the collinear\nparticles. Using multipole expansion the vertex beQ\n\u2212 \u22a5\ncomes i \u03c6in (x)A\u221e\ns\u22a5 (0 , x ) (because for collinear fields\nx\u2212 \u223c 1 and for the soft field x\u2212 \u223c 1/\u03b7.) In this gauge\nthe covariant derivative for collinear particles becomes\n(\u221e)\u03bc\niD\u03bc = i\u2202 \u03bc + gA\u03bcn (x) + gAs\u22a5 (0\u2212 , x\u22a5 ). The gauge\n(\u221e)\nghost As\u22a5 however can be decoupled from collinear\n(0)\u03bc\ngluons defining a \"soft free\" collinear gluon An (x) =\n\u2020\nTsn (x\u22a5 )A\u03bcn (x)Tsn\n(x\u22a5 ) where\n\u0014\n\nTsn = P\u0304 exp ig\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03c4 l\u22a5 *\n\n(\u221e)\nAs \u22a5 (0\u2212 , x\u22a5\n\n\u0015\n\u2212 l\u22a5 \u03c4 ) .\n(12)\n\n(0)\u03bc\n\nDefining Dn\n\n(0)\u03bc\n\n= i\u2202 \u03bc + gAn\n\nwe have il\u22a5 D\u22a5 =\n\n(0)\n\n\u2020\nTsn (x\u22a5 )il\u22a5 Dn\u22a5 Tsn\n(x\u22a5 ) and\n\u0010\n\u0011/\n1\n(0)\n(0) n\u0304\nLII = \u03be\u0304n(0) inDn(0) + iD\n/n\u22a5WnT (0)\nWnT (0)\u2020 iD\n/n\u22a5 \u03ben(0) ,\nin\u0304\u2202\n2\n(13)\n(0)\n\nT (0)\n\n(0)\n\nwhere \u03ben = Tsn (x\u22a5 )\u03ben (x) and Wn\n= Tn W (0) are\nmade out of soft free gluons. Thus thanks to Tsn Wilson lines the soft particles are completely decoupled from\ncollinear particles. The details of the contemporary\ngauge choice n\u0304An = 0 and nAs = 0 is left for future\npublication [13].\nAlternatevely the Wilson lines in SCET are obtained\nthrough \"auxiliary fields\" as illustrated, in covariant\ngauge, in the second work of [1]. Through a two-step\nof matching of the full QCD heavy-to-light current onto\nthe SCET-II effective one, it was shown that the collinear\nWilson line and the soft one can be obtained after integrating out all off-shellnesses larger than Q2 \u03b7 2 by introducing auxiliary fields for each field that goes offshell due to soft-collinear interactions. In LCG however the situation is a bit different. In the case of Tn(n\u0304)\nthe auxiliary field method would contain a sub-leading\n(O(\u03bb)) Lagrangian (including only the transverse component of the collinear gluon field.) Moreover the resulting fermion (in LCG n\u0304An (nAn\u0304 ) = 0) is still on-shell due\nto \u03b4(n\u0304k)(\u03b4(nk)) = 0 so the auxiliary field method breaks\ndown. In SCET-II however all soft gluon field components have the same scaling and in LCG (nAs (n\u0304As ) = 0)\nthe resulting fermion is off-shell of O(Q2 \u03b7) \u226b O(Q2 \u03b7 2 )\nthus the auxiliary field method might be applicable.\nMore on this in Ref. [13].\nII.\n\nAPPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe above derived Lagrangians extend the formulation of SCET valid in covariant gauges to singular gauges\nas well. As it is the case in SCET in covariant gauges,\nthe most important application of these Lagrangians is\nestablishing factorization theorems for high-energy processes. This is especially true for differential crosssections with pT dependence where one expects that the\nnon-perturbative matrix elements entering those factorization theorems to be un-integrated with respect to the\ntransverse momentum. In such cases those matrix elements need a gauge link in the transverse space so\nas to obtain complete gauge invariance. This is implemented naturally with the T -Wilson lines that should\nbe invoked at the level of the basic building blocks of\nSCET. The above discussion allows us to obtain gauge\ninvariant expressions for any non-perturbative matrix elements involving quantum fields separated in the transverse direction. The gauge invariant quark jet was given\n\n\f4\nfirst in [3] and is obtained by simply replacing Wn with\nWnT = Tn Wn , \u03c7n (x) = WnT \u2020 \u03ben (x). Similarly the gluon\njet [9] reads\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\ngBn\u22a5\n= [WnT \u2020 iDn\u22a5\nWnT ],\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the derivative operator acts only within the square\nbrackets. These jets enter the different beam functions\nintroduced in Ref. [5] and in [6]. In both of these works\na low transverse-momentum dependent cross-sections is\nconsidered respectively for the Drell-Yan production,\nRef. [5], and for the Higgs boson production, Ref. [6],\nand the factorization theorems are obtained within the\nSCET formalism. However the non-perturbative matrix\nelements, the so-called \"beam functions\", entering those\nfactorization theorems (see Eq. (9) in [5] and Eqs. (32)\nand (33) in [6]) are gauge invariant only in the class\nof regular gauges. As in the case of the TMDPDF in\nRef. [3], the introduction of the T -Wilson line at the level\nof the SCET Lagrangian and the quark and gluon jets\nallows us to obtain, from first principles of the SCET, a\nwell-defined and gauge invariant physical quantities that\nare relevant for such important LHC processes and crosssections. The gluon jet functions in Ref. [6] should be\n\u03bc\nwritten in terms of Bn\u22a5\nas given in Eq. (14).\nWe remark that the dependence of the soft functions\non transverse fields and transverse coordinates is sensible\nonly in the framework of SCET-II. The proper definition\nof the TMDPDF has to include a subtracted soft function to avoid double counting. This subtraction has long\nbeen argued by Collins and Hautmann [10, 11] and more\nrecently verified in [12] by considering the renormalization group (RG) properties of the TMDPDF. This soft\nfunction includes a transverse gauge link so as to obtain\n\n[1] C. W. Bauer, S. Fleming, D. Pirjol and I. W. Stewart,\nPhys. Rev. D63 (2001) 114020. C. W. Bauer, D. Pirjol and I. W.

The analysis of [10\u201312] was performed\nin QCD. For SCET to generate the results of QCD for\nthe TMDPDF (and for the generalized quantities thereof\nsuch as beam functions) the effective theory formalism\nhas to include quantities like transverse \"soft\" Wilson\nlines to properly account the gauge invariance of the soft\nfunction and the RG properties of TMDPDFs and beam\nfunctions alike. In SCET-II the typical regular gauge\nmatrix element of soft jets < Sn (x)Sn\u0304\u2020 (x)Sn\u0304 (0)Sn\u2020 (0) >\nshould be replaced by < SnT (x)Sn\u0304T \u2020 (x)Sn\u0304T (0)SnT \u2020 (0) >\nT\nwhere Sn(n\u0304)\n(x) = Sn(n\u0304) (x)Tsn(sn\u0304) (x\u22a5 ). Tsn(sn\u0304) (x\u22a5 ) are\nthe soft Wilson lines that arise with the gauge fixing\nnAs (n\u0304As ) = 0 and are 1 otherwise. For instance fixing\n\u2020\nnAs = 0 one gets < Tsn (x\u22a5 )Sn\u0304\u2020 (x)Sn\u0304 (0)Tsn\n(0) >.\nConcluding, we have explained the origin of transverse\ngauge links T within SCET. We have studied which lightcone conditions are compatible with the power counting\nof the effective theory. The relevance of the T -Wilson\nlines in SCET was studied in Ref. [3] for TMDPDF. We\nhave provided a gauge invariant definition of both quark\nand gluon jets. The T -Wilson lines enter the definitions\nof non-perturbative matrix elements in some processes\nrelevant for LHC, like Drell-Yan and Higgs production.\nWe have finally commented on the transverse momentum\ndependence of the soft functions. Further study in this\ndirection is expected in the near future [13].\nWe thank Iain Stewart for his helpful remarks.
