A key piece of information needed to\nfurther this understanding is an accurate knowledge of the luminosity function (LF) for\nAGN over a wide range of absolute magnitudes and redshifts. The AGN LF is populated\nby quasars at the bright end (e.g. Hartwick & Schade 1990) and Seyfert galaxy nuclei,\nconsidered to be their intrinsically fainter counterparts, at the low luminosity end (Cheng\net al. 1985; Huchra & Burg 1992; Maiolino & Rieke 1995; Koehler et al. 1997; Ulvestad &\nHo 2001; Londish et al. 2002).\nUnderstanding how the faint end of the AGN LF evolves is of particular importance\nfor determining the frequency and total space density of AGNs at earlier epochs. This has\nobvious implications for determining their total contribution to the X-ray, IR and UV backgrounds. Large numbers of low-luminosity AGN have been proposed to explain the ionization\nof the intergalactic medium at high redshift (Steidel & Sargent 1989), although recent observational and theoretical results differ on the amount of their true contribution (Barger 2003;\nSchirber & Bullock 2003). Additionally, the faint end is an important constraint on evolutionary models for the AGN LF such as pure luminosity and luminosity-dependent density\nevolution (e.g. Boyle et al. 2000).\nOne method to identify AGN in imaging surveys is via their variable nature. QSOs\nand Seyfert galaxies have long been known as variable objects, with significant optical flux\nchanges occurring on timescales of months to several years. Variability has been a successful method for identifying AGNs, primarily QSOs (Hawkins 1986; Koo et al. 1986;\nHook et al. 1994). A survey for variable sources in SA57 revealed many optically extended,\nSeyfert-like galaxies (Bershady et al. 1998) which generally had higher variability amplitudes\nthan the more luminous QSOs. This result suggests that variability is a good technique for\nselecting intrinsically faint QSOs and Seyfert nuclei.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nWhile variability and other selection techniques (spectroscopy, color selection, etc.) have\nbeen successful in finding QSOs out to high redshifts, the intrinsically fainter AGN (i.e.\nSeyfert galaxies) have been difficult to detect beyond the local universe. Ground-based\nvariability surveys, like spectroscopic surveys, are quickly limited to AGN which dominate\nthe host galaxy light at higher redshift. Recent X-ray surveys with Chandra and XMMNewton have revealed hundreds of X-ray sources at z\u22431. Many of these are confirmed AGN\nbut still many more are ambiguous in nature (e.g Barger et al. 2002). In summary, the\npopulation of moderate-to-high redshift, low-luminosity AGN has not been well surveyed\nand the evolution of the faint end of the AGN LF is still poorly known.\nIn this study, we have searched for optical nuclear variability in HDF1 galaxies to identify\nthe population of active galaxies out to z\u223c1. The primary data sets analyzed for galactic\nvariability are the original HDF observations (Williams et al. 1996) obtained in December\n1995 and a second V-band (F606W) image obtained almost exactly 5 years later in December\nof 2000. The main advantage of HST over ground-based surveys is the ability to do accurate\nphotometry within smaller apertures than can be done from the ground thus allowing us to\nprobe much lower AGN/host galaxy luminosity ratios.\nWe discuss the details of the image processing and photometry in Section 2, followed\nby a discussion of the selected varying galactic nuclei in Sections 3 and 4. In Section 5,\nwe cross-reference our sources with various multi-wavelength surveys. A discussion of the\noptical spectra for the varying sources is presented in Section 6. In Section 7, we present\nthe luminosity function for variable nuclei. We close with a summary of our conclusions in\nSection 8.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nPHOTOMETRY\nImage Processing\n\nThe original epoch HDF data in F606W consisted of 108 individual exposures with a\ntotal integration time of 113,050 seconds. These data were obtained with a total of 9 unique\ndithers covering both sub-pixel offsets and multiple pixels on a scale of about \u00b1 10 WF pixels.\nThe primary data processing technique was detailed in Gilliland, Nugent, and Phillips (1999)\nfor creation of over-sampled, by a factor of four, summed images with resulting noise and\nresolution properties competitive with, and sometimes slightly better than those reported\nin Williams et al. (1996). The mean epoch of the original F606W data was MJD 50076.9.\n1\n\nHDF refers to the Hubble Deep Field North\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nExposure times used for the original epoch ranged from 350 to 1500 seconds with a mean\nsky rate of 0.0758 e-/s.\nThe second epoch HDF data in F606W was taken with GO-8389 (PI Rodrigo Ibata)\nwith a science goal distinct from that here, but one that also required precise differential\nmeasurements across the two epochs. These data consisted of 70 individual exposures each\nof 1300 seconds for a total exposure time of 91,000 seconds. The goal was to have the new\ndata obtained at the same pointing as the original HDF, and at the same orientation, and\nwith dithering over the same spatial scale, but with an improved level of sampling using 35\nunique dithers. This goal was quite well met, thus resulting in quite similar data in the two\nF606W epochs. The mean epoch of the second F606W data was MJD 51882.9 implying a\ndelta of 4.94 years. The mean sky rate for the newer epoch was 0.0958 e-/s. Processing\nof the second epoch data was identical to that of the first, using the same software as\ndescribed in Gilliland, Nugent and Phillips (1999). To facilitate simple, robust analysis of\ndata from the two epochs the registrations of the second epoch were evaluated using a grid\nof galaxies from the original epoch (stars could not be used since these show unique proper\nmotions over five years); this results in second epoch over-sampled combined images that\nare accurately aligned to the first epoch with maximum errors of \u223c0.05 pixels. Therefore,\ncomparative analysis for change across epochs can be made using precisely the same pixels,\nmapping back to common physical domains. For both epochs, each individual frame was\nsky subtracted before combining, cosmic rays were eliminated (effected pixels assigned zero\nweight in the combination) and hot pixels subtracted.\nThe extreme stability provided by HST is an essential factor in being able to probe to\nunique sensitivity levels with these extensive observations. Limiting factors, to be discussed\nfurther below, arise from (1) a time-varying Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) that must be\nempirically corrected for, and (2) limited sub-pixel dithering in the first HDF epoch that\nresults in minor mismatches noticeable for the objects with tight cores at high signal to\nnoise.\n\n2.2.\n\nSource Selection and Aperture Size\n\nWe created a catalog of HDF objects using DAOFIND in IRAF2 to ensure a systematic\nselection of all sources in the V-band images. All objects above the 8\u03c3 detection threshold\n2\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National\nScience Foundation.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nwere identified in the 1995 images (the deeper of the two) using a kernel size of 1.8\u00d7 the\nsemi-major axis of the Gaussian convolution kernel (1.3 pixels) to allow more sensitivity to\nextended objects. The catalog was then edited to remove a minority of objects that did not\nappear to be centered on galaxies (i.e. multiple detections within single galaxies). For very\namorphous galaxies with no clear center, all bright \"knots\" appearing within the source were\nretained in the catalog.\nFor our photometry, we chose a small aperture consistent with the FWHM of stellar\nsources in the field. Stars have FWHM\u22435.5 pixels in the over-sampled images corresponding to \u223c0.14\u2032\u2032 . We chose an aperture size of 6 pixels in diameter to be most sensitive to\nphotometric changes in an unresolved nucleus. This approach differs from that taken in\nSarajedini, Gilliland & Phillips (2000; hereafter SGP), where the aperture size was scaled to\nthe size of the galaxy. Our goal here is to provide better sensitivity to variable active nuclei\nwith less dilution from the underlying, non-varying host galaxy light.\nAperture photometry for all sources was performed on the direct images using the\nPHOT algorithm in IRAF. Because the second epoch image was aligned with the first,\nexactly the same pixels were used in both epochs. During image processing, the background\nwas subtracted and the images were scaled to an exposure time of 6000s. This allowed the\nsky value to be held constant at zero for both epochs and all WF CCDs. The resulting\nnuclear magnitudes for each galaxy in the HDF were then adjusted by a zero-point offset to\nbring them into agreement with the integrated, isophotal galaxy V-band AB magnitudes of\nWilliams et al. (1996).\n\n2.3.\n\nCharge Transfer Efficiency Losses And Photometric Errors\n\nAfter performing aperture photometry, nuclear variability can then be determined by\nsimply obtaining the difference in magnitude for each source over the two epochs. Figure 1\nshows the magnitude difference between the 1995 and 2000 images as a function of magnitude\nwithin an aperture of r=3 pixels, the equivalent of 0.15\u2032\u2032 in diameter. The solid line represents\nno difference in magnitude between the two epochs.\nThe main culprit producing the obvious offset from the solid line is charge transfer\nefficiency (CTE) losses. As in SGP, we find a clear correlation of the photometric differences\nwith position on the CCD and magnitude. This is the well known CTE effect (Whitmore\net al. 1999; Biretta et al. 2001) which causes targets far from the CCD readout amplifier to\nappear fainter than similar targets near the amplifier. For this reason, the effect is usually\nmore significant in the Y-direction, (the direction of the readout down the CCD) than the\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nX-direction (the direction of the readout of the shift register at the bottom of the CCD).\nAlthough the 1995\u20131997 I-band study did not show significant correlations in the X-direction,\nthe longer time interval sampled here does show a significant correlation in the X-direction\nfor all 3 WF CCDs. Additionally, we note that the slope of the relation is generally steeper\nin the Y-direction than had been determined in SGP. This is expected due to the longer 5\nyear time interval between epochs in this study.\nWe first attempted to fit the relationship between object position, magnitude difference\nand magnitude globally for all 3 WF CCDs as done in SGP. However, we found that this\napproach was not sufficient to equally remove the CTE effect from all WF CCDs. Differences\nin the slope of the relation between the CCDs were significant and could easily be determined\nfor each CCD individually. We adopted a two-step approach to determine this relationship.\nFirst, we fit a linear surface to the X and Y object positions and the magnitude differences\nusing SURFIT in IRAF for each CCD. While the slope of the fit was found to be significant\nwith both the X and Y positions, the value of the slope was steeper with Y position in all\n3 WF CCDs, consistent with what is expected for CTE losses. The slope of the relation\nbetween Y position and magnitude difference was found to be -2.6\u00d710\u22125 , -1.3\u00d710\u22125 and\n-1.46\u00d710\u22125 mag/pixel for WF2, WF3 and WF4 respectively. The slope of the relation with\nX position, while significant, was found to be about an order of magnitude lower in all 3 WF\nCCDs. These fits were used to correct the magnitude difference values for position-dependent\noffsets. Secondly we fit the dependence of the magnitude difference with nuclear magnitude.\nA 3rd order fit was required to properly model the dependence in all 3 WF CCDs. After\napplying this correction to the data in Figure 1, the resulting photometric differences are\nshown in Figure 2 as a function of nuclear magnitude.\nFinally, we determine the expected noise level for non-variable sources. As in SGP,\nwe divided the full set of individual exposures into two sets composed simply of the oddnumbered frames and the even-numbered frames. Each set represents an \"epoch\" without\nany real time difference. These images effectively carry through the effects of object and sky\nPoisson noise, readout noise, and possible errors in the adopted sky zero points.\nThe magnitude of each galaxy was then measured in the odd and even data sets and\ndifference in magnitude vs. the average magnitude within r=3 pixel apertures is shown\nin Figure 3a. Figure 3b is the RMS of the intensity differences shown in a) within unity\nmagnitude intervals. The solid line represents a quadratic fit to the points which is the\nadopted 1\u03c3 galaxy photometric error as a function of magnitude.\nThe precision of the photometry must be independently limited at the bright end of\nthe distribution, since systematic effects not captured by the odd-even data set comparisons\nbecome limiting factors (e.g. the sometimes poor distribution of sub-pixel phase-space dithers\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nin the first epoch data). In SGP, we adopted a floor of 1.2%. Here we adopt a more\nconservative value of 1.5% consistent with the use of much smaller apertures on average for\nbright sources in the current study than in SGP. As should be apparent, this is a reasonable\nlimit for photometric precision to adopt, but in detail remains somewhat arbitrary.\n\n3.\n\nSELECTION OF VARIABLES AND SURVEY COMPLETENESS\n\nFigure 4a is the absolute value, CTE-corrected magnitude differences for sources in\nthe HDF. The solid line represents the 3\u03c3 limit for variability significance (3\u00d7 the RMS\nindicated by the solid line in Figure 3b). Objects above this limit are selected as significant\nvariables and are indicated with open hexagons. Figure 4b is the result of normalizing the\nmagnitude difference by this solid line. Here the Y-axis indicates the level of significance\nof each source in units of \u03c3. The X-axis extends at the faint end to Vnuc =29.0, which is\nthe estimated photometric completeness magnitude limit for galaxy nuclei in this survey.\nBeyond this limit, the number counts for galaxies in the HDF begin to decrease.\nWe find sixteen galaxies whose nuclei have undergone at least a 3\u03c3 variation over the 5\nyear time interval. These sources are listed in Table 1 with columns as follows: (1) Williams\net al. (1996) ID, (2) & (3) RA & DEC (J2000), (4) Redshift from the literature, (5) Spectral\ntype based on photometry from Fern\u00e1ndez-Soto, Lanzetta and Yahil (1999, hereafter: FLY),\n(6) Vnuc internal to r=3 pixel aperture, (7) Magnitude difference between 1995 and 2000;\npositive implies brighter in 1995, (8) Significance of change obtained when normalized by the\nexpected error as a function of magnitude, (8) Bulge-to-Total (B/T) 2-dimensional model\nfits for the I(F814W) images from Marleau & Simard (1998). The last several columns relate\nto the source detection at other wavelengths discussed in Section 5.\nThere are two distinct completeness issues that effect our survey. The first is related\nto the incomplete time-sampling of the variable sources we wish to detect. Most variability\nsurveys employ a method where the survey field is imaged several times over many years (e.g.\nTrevese et al. 1994; Hawkins 2002). Depending on the quality of the data, these surveys\nhave shown that virtually all known AGN will be found to vary if observed periodically over\nseveral years. Our study is limited by the fact that we have only two epochs with which\nto determine variability and therefore sample just two points on the lightcurve of a varying\nsource. Because of this, we will be incomplete in our census of AGN since some varying\nsources could lie at magnitudes close to their original magnitude measured 5 years earlier\nand would thus go undetected in our survey.\nWe estimate our incompleteness due to undersampling of the lightcurve by using variabil-\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nity data for AGN obtained over many years. We randomly select points along the lightcurve\nseparated by 5 years, the time interval sampled by our HDF images. Because long term variability surveys for low-luminosity AGN have not yet been published, we have conducted this\ntest with two sets of QSO lightcurve data; a sample of PG quasars from Giveon et al. (1999)\nand a sample of SA57 quasars from Trevese et al. (1994). Giveon et al. monitored 42 quasars\nover 7 years with a typical sampling interval of 40 days while Trevese et al. monitored 64\nover 15 years about once a year. Sampling these lightcurves every 5 years and assuming\nphotometric errors typical of our HDF images, we can estimate the probability that these\nsources would be detected in our survey. We find that \u223c75\u201380% would be detected as varying by at least 3\u03c3 with only 2 observations separated by 5 years. Therefore, the results of\nour analysis are likely to underrepresent the true number of variable nuclei by \u223c20\u201325%.\nThe second incompleteness issue results from the use of a fixed aperture to detect nuclear\nvariability. We have chosen a small, fixed aperture to minimize dilution of the AGN light\nfrom the underlying host galaxy to be more sensitive to AGN varying within bright hosts.\nWe set this aperture to the size of an unresolved point source in the HST images (0.15\u2032\u2032\nin diameter). The fixed aperture will include the same amount of light from an unresolved\nsource regardless of its redshift. However, the aperture will contain a larger fraction of the\nunderlying, resolved galaxy for higher redshift objects than for low-z sources. Because of\nthis, the dilution of the nuclear light by the galaxy increases as a function of redshift and,\nconsequently, as a function of nuclear magnitude. If we assume a disk-dominated, re =1 kpc\ngalaxy containing an AGN that is 10% of the host galaxy light and varying by \u2206m=0.3\nmagnitudes, the measured \u2206m within our fixed aperture would be 0.15 magnitudes at z=0.2\nbut only 0.06 magnitudes at z=1. The observed total nuclear magnitude would drop by \u223c3\nmagnitudes over this interval. The increasing dilution with redshift is compounded by the\nincreasing photometric errors with magnitude. For an AGN that has varied by \u2206m=0.3\u20130.2\nmags, consistent with typical structure function values for AGN (Trevese et al. 1994), and\nreasonable estimates for the galaxy magnitude, morphology, physical size and true AGN\nfraction, we estimate that incompleteness due to significant AGN dilution begins to effect\nour survey at magnitudes between Vnuc \u224326.5 to Vnuc \u224327.5.\nAs can be seen in Figure 4, all of the variables lie at magnitudes greater than Vnuc =27.3.\nWhile this may partially be due to a real astrophysical effect (see discussion in Section 4),\nthis limiting magnitude is within the range of our incompleteness estimate above. Therefore,\nalthough we survey galaxy nuclei to Vnuc \u224329, our limit for detecting variable AGN at a\nuniformly varying level within galaxy nuclei is probably closer to Vnuc \u224327.5, with decreasing\ncompleteness fainter than Vnuc \u224326.5.\nThe 16 variable nuclei detected in our survey represent 2.2% of the galaxies brighter than\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nVnuc =29.0 or 7.4% of the galaxies brighter than Vnuc =27.5. To emphasize the significance\nof the variable sources, Figure 5 is a histogram of the sigma distribution for galaxies in the\nHDF. The X-axis is the absolute value of the normalized magnitude difference (\u03c3) and the\nY-axis is the natural logarithm of the number of sources in 0.25\u03c3 bins. Errorbars represent\nthe poisson statistical errors. Filled circles show the histogram for all 719 nuclei brighter\nthan Vnuc =29.0 and open squares represent the 217 nuclei brighter than Vnuc =27.5. The\ncurved lines are gaussian fits to the data within 2.5\u03c3 (solid is the fit to data brighter than\nVnuc =29.0 and dashed is the fit to data brighter than 27.5). In both distributions, the data\nare well fit by gaussians out to \u223c3\u03c3 and show a \"tail\" of significant variables extending to\nhigher \u03c3 values. In a normal distribution, we would expect a total of \u223c5 sources to be greater\nthan 3\u03c3 brighter than Vnuc =29.0 with \u223c1.5 expected to lie brighter than Vnuc =27.5.\nBased on Gaussian statistics, we estimate that \u223c1\u20132 of our variables (all detected\nbrighter than Vnuc =27.5) are spurious, implying that the true number of variables is \u223c14. If\nwe also correct by 20\u201325% for incompleteness due to lightcurve sampling, the incompleteness\ncorrected number of variables in the HDF is \u223c18 representing 8.3% of the nuclei brighter\nthan Vnuc =27.5.\nOne of the 16 variables detected in this survey, 2-251.0, was also identified as variable in\nthe I-band variability survey of the HDF (SGP). Eight variables were detected in that survey\nwith significant (>\n\u223c3\u03c3) magnitude changes over the 2 year time interval (1995\u20131997). Object\n2-251.0 is by far the brightest of these sources, having a nuclear V magnitude \u223c13\u00d7 brighter\nthan the next brightest source. Of the 7 I-band variables not detected in the present survey,\n5 are fainter than Vnuc =28.0, placing them below the expected sensitivity limits for this\nstudy. The other two I-band variables, 3-266.0 and 3-404.0, have Vnuc \u224327.0. In the present\nstudy, object 3-266.0 changed by 0.025 mag (1.1\u03c3 significance) and object 3-404.0 changed\nby 0.052 mag (2.0\u03c3 significance). The latter source is a marginally significant detection\nand would lie above the 3\u03c3 limit if it had been brighter than \u223c26.5 in the V-band. Object\n3-266.0, at just over 1\u03c3 significance, may be variable but at lower significance due to the\n2-epoch statistical incompleteness effect discussed above.\n\n4.\n\nPROPERTIES OF THE SELECTED VARIABLE NUCLEI AND HOST\nGALAXIES\n\nFigure 6 contains the 1995 V-band images for galaxies with variable nuclei. The postage\nstamp images are 3\u2032\u2032 on a side and are scaled to the same maximum pixel value. It can be\nseen from this figure and Table 1 that the selected galaxies cover a range of morphologies,\nmagnitudes and colors. Their redshifts range from 0.09 to 1.8 with a median <z>\u22430.66.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nMany of the galaxies have significant bulge components based to the 2-dimensional model\nfits. We note, however, that several sources with B/T=0 also have high chi-square values\n(>1.25) which in some cases appears to be due to a poorly fit bulge component. In addition to\nthe morphological B/T parameter, we also list the spectral type for the source based upon\nthe photometry of FLY to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies in the HDF. The\nselected galaxies appear to be evenly distributed over all spectral classes with no particular\npreference towards early or late-type galaxies.\nFigure 7 is a color magnitude diagram of the galaxy nuclei for sources in the HDF. The\nvariable nuclei are indicated with larger solid triangles. The variables cover the full range\nof V\u2013I colors and do not appear to be preferentially bluer or redder than the non-varying\nnuclei of galaxies in the HDF.\nAll of the variables lie at the bright end of the magnitude distribution. As previously\ndiscussed, incompleteness due to increasing AGN light dilution as a function of redshift is\nlikely to contribute to this observation. However, an astrophysical effect may be at least\npartly responsible. AGN are generally found in brighter host galaxies than those that do not\nharbor AGN (Huchra & Burg 1992; Ho et al. 1997; Hamilton et al. 2002). If these sources\nare indeed AGN, we might expect to find them in the brighter galaxies. An additional factor\nis the inclusion of the AGN light in the nuclear magnitude. We can minimize the above\nmentioned incompleteness effect by considering only those sources brighter than Vnuc =26.5,\nwhere incompleteness is not expected to be significant. We find that 23% (5/22) of nuclei are\nvariable at 21.8<Vnuc<25.5 while only 15% (6/39) are variable at 25.5<Vnuc <26.5. While\nthe small numbers do not provide significance, this trend is consistent with the previous\nstudies concerning AGN host galaxies.\n\n5.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH MULTI-WAVELENGTH HDF SURVEYS\n\nThe HDF has been surveyed with a variety of other telescopes and instruments providing\na wonderful resource of multi-wavelength information for this particular region of the sky.\nWe have cross-referenced our list of variable nuclei with published catalogs of X-ray, radio\nand far-infrared sources as well as other photometric and spectroscopic surveys used to search\nfor nuclear activity.\nAGN have long been recognized as X-ray sources, being associated with a wide range of\nactivity levels from the brightest quasars to low-luminosity Seyferts. Even highly obscured\nAGN can often be detected at X-ray wavelengths. Some of the light obscured by dust at\nother wavelengths will be reprocessed and emitted in the mid-IR. For these reasons, the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nX-ray and mid-IR regimes are excellent wavelengths in which to detect and study AGN.\nRecent deep surveys with the Chandra X-ray Observatory have resolved many X-ray\nsources in the HDF and provide information about the nature of the X-ray radiation. The\n2Ms Chandra X-ray survey (Alexander et al. 2003) has detected 20 sources in the original\nHDF and an additional 2 sources of lower significance which are listed in their supplementary\ncatalog. Of these 22 detections, 18 are included in our variability study. Two were not\nincluded because their optical fluxes were too faint to be included in our survey and an\nadditional pair fell too close to the edge of the CCD to obtain accurate nuclear photometry\nin both epochs. Of these 18 sources, we find seven that match (within 1.2\u2032\u2032 ) the positions\nof our variable nuclei (see columns 10 and 11 of Table 1). The filled symbols in Figure\n4 represent the 18 X-ray sources included in our survey and show the level of variability\nsignificance for each source.\nIn addition, we have found several variables coincident with source positions from\nthe ISOCAM 15\u03bcm survey of the HDF (Aussel et al. 1999) and the 1.4GHz radio survey (Richards et al. 1999). These are listed in columns 12 through 14 of Table 1. Below, we\ndiscuss the variable galaxy nuclei that overlap with one or more of these multi-wavelength\nsurveys.\n2-251.0: This z=0.960 early-type spiral galaxy is one of only two broad-line AGN in\nthe HDF (see Section 6) and is a bright X-ray source detected with Chandra in the soft,\nhard and ultrahard bands (Hornscheiemer et al. 2000; Brandt et al. 2001a \u2013 hereafter H00,\nB01a) with a photon index of 0.67. We detect it as an optical variable at 6.5\u03c3 significance.\nAs previously mentioned, it is the only object that was also detected in our I-band survey\nof the HDF (SGP). Spectroscopic detection of broad MgII (Phillips et al. 1997), as well as\n1.4GHz radio (Richards et al. 1999a) and ISOCAM (Aussel et al. 1999) detections for this\nsource all corroborate the AGN nature of this galaxy. Spectral fitting of the X-ray data has\nrevealed a large intrinsic column density which appears to be related to the AGN (B01a).\n3-355.0: This elliptical galaxy at z=0.474 is a 3.2\u03c3 variable. The original 166ks Chandra\nexposure did not detect this source in the hard band, but B01a report hard X-ray counts\nfrom the deeper 479.7ks exposure. The photon index determined from the 2Ms exposure is\n1.8. This galaxy is also a radio source with a steep radio spectrum (\u03b1=1.0). Its position is\ncoincident with an ISO source from the Aussel et al. (1999) supplementary table of lower\nsignificance detections. H00 note that the X-ray luminosity for this source is consistent with\nthat expected from hot gas in an elliptical but the nuclear variability detected here suggests\nthis galaxy may also host an AGN.\n3-659.1: The variable source is a spiral galaxy at z=0.401 (Barger et al. 2002) with a\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nvariability significance of 4\u03c3. This optical galaxy is \u223c1.2\u2032\u2032 from the hardest X-ray source\n(\u0393=0.56) in the HDF. The X-ray position is only 0.22\u2032\u2032 from the second reddest source\nin the HDF NICMOS survey (Dickinson et al. 2000). Even though the optical galaxy is\npositioned further from the center of the X-ray emission, the detected variability suggests\nthat perhaps some of the X-ray emission originates from the galaxy nucleus. There is also\nsignificant 1.4GHz radio emission (Richards et al. 1999a) and 15\u03bcm emission detected with\nISO (Aussel et al. 1999). The radio position is again more closely aligned with the NICMOS\nsource than the optical galaxy (see Figure 1 in Richards 1999b) but both the NICMOS and\noptical sources are within the positional uncertainties.\n3-965.111111: This is the most significant variable in our survey (9.4\u03c3). It was not\ndetected in either the radio or mid-IR bands and was first detected in the 1Ms Chandra\nsurvey (Brandt et al. 2001b). It was detected in both the soft and hard X-ray bands in the\n2Ms survey and has a photon index of 0.91. It is a bright elliptical galaxy near the edge of\nthe HDF at z=0.663.\n4-752.1: This optically variable (3.1\u03c3) X-ray source is also an FR I radio galaxy\n(Richards 2000) with extensive radio structure. The host galaxy is a red elliptical at z=1.05.\nThis source has not been detected in the hard X-ray band and thus appears to fall into the\nlow X-ray luminosity/soft X-ray spectrum grouping of very red objects (Hogg et al. 2000).\nBecause of its faintness, the photon index cannot be determined. B01a suggests that the\nX-ray emission is associated with the central AGN or the hot interstellar medium and X-ray\nbinaries of the elliptical galaxy. It is not detected in the mid-infrared.\n4-976.1: This bright spiral galaxy at z=0.089 is variable at the 3.6\u03c3 significance level.\nB01a notes that the position of the X-ray source is not coincident with the galaxy nucleus\n(which is 1.1\u2032\u2032 away) but does lie near (\u223c0.14\u2032\u2032 ) an off-nuclear bright spot. They suggest\nthat this bright spot may be a background AGN, starbursting region, or \"super Eddington\"\nX-ray binary (B01a, H00). Our variability measurements have been made on the central\nnuclear region of this galaxy which, if hosting an AGN, may be responsible for at least part\nof the X-ray emission. The photon index for this source is 1.7. This galaxy is within 3.3\u2032\u2032 of\na mid-IR source (Aussel et al. 1999).\n3-386.111: This is a spiral galaxy at z=0.474 which is listed in the 2Ms X-ray survey\nsupplementary catalog containing lower significance sources associated with optically bright\nobjects. The nucleus has a variability significance of 3.8\u03c3. This source was not detected in\nthe hard X-ray band. It is associated with an ISO source listed in the supplementary ISO\nsource catalog.\nOne additional variable nucleus, 4-254.0, matched the position of a lower significance\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nX-ray source indicated in the 1.38Ms Chandra survey (Brandt et al. 2002). This X-ray\nsource, however, was not listed among the 2Ms detections. The object is an elliptical galaxy\nat z=0.901 which is also associated with an ISO detection in the supplementary catalog.\nOf the remaining 8 variable nuclei, one (2-860.0) is associated with a mid-IR detection\nand another (3-943.0) is within \u223c2\u2032\u2032 of a 1.4GHz radio source. The other 6 are not associated\nwith any of the multi-wavelength surveys discussed here.\nOverall, 44% (7/16) of our variable galaxy nuclei have X-ray counterparts from the 2Ms\nChandra survey (or 31% excluding the two matches with greatest positional offsets). Optical\nvariables make up 39% of the X-ray sources. Of the brightest X-ray sources (full-band flux\n\u22652.4\u00d710\u221216 ergs/s) five out of nine (56%) are associated with optical variables. If we assume\nthat the observed optical variability indicates the presence of an AGN, this is an important\ncheck on the nature of the X-ray emitting source and could potentially help discriminate\nbetween low-luminosity X-ray emitting AGN and other X-ray emitting phenomena such as\nsupernova remnants or X-ray binaries. There does not appear to be a relation between\nphoton index and the detection of optical variability. Five of the eight X-ray sources in the\nHDF with enough signal to determine photon indices are optical variables. The X-ray/optical\nvariables make up two of the softer X-ray sources and three of the harder sources in this\nsmall sample.\nSeven of our 16 variables are associated with mid-IR detections (44%) and five (31%)\nhave radio emission at 1.4GHz. Variable galaxies make up 22% of the detected sources at\n15\u03bcm. This is comparable to the portion of the mid-IR integrated light attributed to AGN\nbased on the correlation of mid-IR sources with Chandra sources (Elbaz et al. 1999).\nFinally, we have compared our results with two photometric studies to identify QSOs\nin the HDF on the basis of multi-band colors. Jarvis & MacAlpine (1998) identified 12 high\nredshift (z>3.5) QSO candidates. Eleven of these sources were included in our variability survey but none showed significant variability amplitudes, having a median \u03c3 of \u223c0.6. Based\non structure functions for AGN/QSOs (Trevese et al. 1994; Hook et al. 1994; Hawkins\net al. 2002) and taking into account time-dilation effects (\u2206trest =\u2206t/(1+z)), the average\nmagnitude change expected in our survey for high-z QSOs is \u223c0.1\u20130.2 magnitudes. Even\nsources dominated by an AGN component, as expected for these color-selected candidates,\nwould be difficult to detect above the 3\u03c3 significance threshold due to their faint apparent magnitudes (Vnuc >\n\u223c27.7). Nonetheless, an average magnitude change of only \u223c0.05 is\nsignificantly less than the 0.1\u20130.2 average magnitude change predicted from QSO structure\nfunctions.\nConti et al. (1999) also identify 20 compact sources having QSO-like colors and mor-\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nphologies with estimated redshifts between z\u223c1 and 5.5. The nuclear magnitudes for these\nobjects lie at Vnuc \u224327\u201328. None were identified as variable above the 3\u03c3 threshold in our\nsurvey. The average nuclear magnitude of this sample is \u223c1 magnitude brighter than the\nJarvis & MacAlpine QSOs. If these are variable QSOs/AGN-dominated galaxies, we would\nagain expect an average magnitude change of \u223c0.1\u20130.2. The average change in magnitude\nfor the Conti et al. sample over the 5 year interval is \u223c0.03 magnitudes, with all sources\nlying well below the 2\u03c3 significance limit.\n\n6.\n\nOPTICAL SPECTRA\n\nThe extensive redshift surveys of the HDF from Cohen et al. (1996; 2000), Phillips\net al. (1997) and Barger et al. (2002) have revealed only two broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs)\nin the HDF proper. These are 2-251.0 (z=0.96 variable galaxy and X-ray source discussed\nabove) and 4-852.12 (z=0.943 X-ray source). The measured variability significance of 4852.12 is 0.35\u03c3. It is possible that this source is variable but has been observed at two\npoints in its light curve that are close to the same magnitude. Further monitoring of the\nHDF would be necessary to rule out optical variability for this BLAGN.\nWe have studied the available spectra for all of the galaxies hosting variable nuclei to\ndetermine if any of the sources show specific emission lines or line flux ratios indicative of\nType 2 AGN. Of the 16 variables, optical spectra exist for 13. One of these is the BLAGN\n2-251.0 already discussed, which shows broad MgII (\u03bb2800) emission and absorption in its\nspectrum. Almost all of the remaining 12 show emission lines in their spectra. Nine out of\n11 show OII(\u03bb3727) when in range, with several sources also displaying H\u03b2 and OIII(\u03bb5007).\nThe X-ray and strong radio FRII galaxy 4-752.1, displays only strong absorption lines in\nits spectrum. Only one source, 4-254.0, shows weak NeV(\u03bb3426) emission, a line indicative\nof the presence of an AGN (Hall et al. 2000). NeIII(\u03bb3869), also stronger in AGN than in\nstarforming galaxies (Rola et al. 1997), is seen weakly in 2 sources, 3-143.0 and 3-386.111111.\nThese galaxies also show OIII and H\u03b2, but with flux ratios consistent with star formation\nrather than AGN activity (Veilleux & Osterbrock 1997). Only the spiral galaxy 4-976.1 is\nlow enough redshift to reveal strong H\u03b1, SII(\u03bb6713+6731) and OI(\u03bb6300) emission in the\noptical spectrum. The line flux ratios of OIII/H\u03b2, SII/H\u03b1 and OI/H\u03b1 all indicate that this\nsource is near the border that divides starforming galaxies and AGN (Veilleux & Osterbrock\n1997). Therefore, based on the optical spectra alone, objects 2-251.0 (BLAGN), possibly\n4-976.1 (LINER/Seyfert 2), and possibly 4-254.0 (through the weak presence of NeV) show\nevidence of AGN.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n7.\n\nLUMINOSITY FUNCTION FOR VARIABLE NUCLEI\n\nKnowledge of the space density of faint AGN at higher redshifts is critical to our understanding of AGN evolution and the AGN phenomenon in general. Our sample of 16 variable\nsources spans a redshift range of z=0.1 to 1.8 with most sources lying between z=0.4 and\n1.1. If we make the assumption that these variables are indeed AGN, it is interesting to\ncompare their number density with local samples of AGN.\nWe must first estimate the luminosity of the AGN candidates in our survey. Due to the\nfaint magnitudes and small angular sizes of many of the variables, 2-dimensional modeling to\nseparate the components (disk+bulge+AGN) of the galaxies is difficult and would not yield\nconsistent results for all of the selected galaxies. A simpler approach is to estimate the AGN\nluminosities by assuming that the entire nuclear flux is attributed to the AGN. This value is\nan overestimate in one sense since the nuclear light will also include light from the underlying\ngalaxy, though the small nuclear aperture minimizes the contribution from the host. Based\non the expected level of variability over this time interval predicted from AGN structure\nfunctions, we estimate the variable component for our AGN candidates to be no less than\n15% of the total nuclear light. In the most extreme case, the true AGN magnitude could\nbe \u223c2 magnitudes fainter than that measured within the nuclear aperture. In another sense\nhowever, we underestimate the AGN flux since we have not applied aperture corrections to\ninclude light from the wings of the PSF. Our aperture of r=0.075\u2032\u2032 encircles about 50% of\nthe flux from a point source (Holtzman et al. 1995). If the point source makes up the entire\nflux within the aperture, an aperture correction would increase the magnitude by up to \u223c0.8\nmag. If the point source is some fraction of the total nuclear light, the aperture correction\nwill be smaller. Determining the true aperture correction is not possible without knowing\nthe relative fluxes of the point source and host within the fixed aperture.\nFigure 8 is the absolute magnitude based on the nuclear flux vs the source redshift\n(Ho =75 km/s/Mpc; qo =0.5). The absolute B magnitudes are calculated assuming a powerlaw index of \u03b1=\u20131.0 resulting in a K-correction of zero and VF 606W \u2013BJ =\u20130.32. We find that\nmost sources lie between -15>\n\u223cMB >\n\u223c-17 in the redshift range 0.4<z<1.1.\nWe conduct the Luminosity-Volume test, or V/Vmax test, of Schmidt (1968) to determine if significant evolution is present in our sample of variable nuclei. For this calculation,\nwe determine for each source in our survey the maximum redshift at which it could exist and\nstill be included in our survey. The volume of space enclosed by a sphere with a radius equal\nto this zmax is the value Vmax . The volume enclosed at the true redshift of the source is V .\nSpectroscopic redshifts have been determined for 14 of our objects. Photometric redshifts are\nestimated for one other (FLY). There is no spectroscopic or photometric redshift published\nfor 2-456.22. Based on the V\u2013I color for this object, we estimate its photometric redshift to\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nbe z=1.8 which corresponds to those of other HDF sources with similar colors.\nTo define zmax , we determine the limiting redshift for each source to be detected in our\nsurvey. The brightest limiting magnitude in our survey is defined by the 3\u03c3 line in Figure\n4a, which indicates the faintest magnitude at which a source varying by a given \u2206m would\nbe considered a significant variable. Below this magnitude, a source varying by \u2206m would\nnot be detected as variable. Therefore, zmax is the redshift where the apparent magnitude\nof a nucleus varying by \u2206m falls below the 3\u03c3 variability significance limit shown in Figure\n4a.\nThe mean V/Vmax for the 16 nuclei in our survey is 0.67\u00b10.07. For a population of\nobjects uniformly distributed in space, <V/Vmax >=0.5. Our value of 0.67\u00b10.07 indicates\nthat sources are found more often at larger distances than at nearby distances, indicating\nsome evolution in the population of galaxies with variable nuclei. Our survey incompleteness,\nas discussed in Section 3, affects our ability to detect sources at higher redshifts and fainter\nmagnitudes. Thus, the value of <V/Vmax > would actually be higher if corrected for this\nincompleteness. An increase in the number density would be consistent with the picture of\nAGN/QSO evolution at higher luminosities, where the population increases rapidly out to\nz\u22433.\nEven though evolution may be present among our sample, the small number of sources\nspread over a range in redshift makes it difficult to construct the luminosity function in more\nthan one redshift bin. To accurately compare the density of our sources to local samples, we\nconstruct the LF in one redshift bin at z=0.4\u20131.1. We choose these limits to minimize the\nredshift range of our sources while maximizing the number of sources in the bin. Twelve of\nour 16 sources lie within this redshift range, which excludes the 2 lowest and highest redshift\ngalaxies. The mean redshift for these sources is <z>=0.69.\nWe calculate the luminosity function using a technique similar in nature to the V/Vmax\ntest described above. The LF is created by summing 1/Vmax for sources in discrete magnitude bins. In this case, we are actually determining Va , or the accessible volume in which\neach source could be detected. This volume is limited not only by the magnitude limit for detection, but also by the lower and upper redshift limits of the shell in which we are summing.\nFigure 9 is the LF for HDF variable nuclei in the redshift range z=0.4\u20131.1. Incompleteness\ndue to the fact that our variability selection is based on only 2 epochs is expected to produce\nan underestimate in the number of AGN by a factor of \u223c1.3, or a decrease in log\u03c6 of \u223c0.12.\nFor comparison, we plot the local Seyfert LFs of Huchra & Burg (1992; HB92) from the\nCfA survey and Ulvestad & Ho (2001; UH01) from the Palomar survey. Both local surveys\nconsist of spectroscopically selected Seyfert 1s and 2s.\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nOur LF for variable sources at 0.4<z<1.1 extends to fainter absolute magnitudes than\nthe local LFs, largely due to the fact that the local LFs are calculated for the total galaxy\nlight (AGN+host) rather than the magnitude of the AGN alone. Nonetheless, many of the\nAGN candidates detected in our survey may be truly fainter than those of HB92. Based on\nthe spectroscopic selection criterion employed by HB92, most of our sources would not be\ndetected as AGN (see Section 6) in the HB92 survey. Therefore, we assume that the AGN\ncomponent in our galaxies do not comprise as much of the total galaxy light as the HB92\nsources and are likely to be intrinsically fainter.\nThe UH01 LF covers the same integrated galaxy magnitude range as HB92 but shows\nan overall higher density for local Seyferts. Ulvestad & Ho explain that this is due to the\nfact that their LF includes intrinsically fainter seyfert nuclei than does the HB92 sample.\nFor the Seyfert 1 galaxies, Ho & Peng (2001) decompose the nuclei from the host galaxies\nin both local samples and confirm this assertion, finding a median nuclear magnitude of\nMB =-14.6 for UH01 versus -17.4 for the HB92 Seyfert 1 galaxies. From their study, we also\nfind that the nuclear magnitudes of the local seyferts in both samples can be extremely faint\nwhen compared to the total galaxy magnitude, in some cases up to 10 magnitudes fainter.\nTherefore, an LF consisting of nuclear magnitudes for local Seyferts would be a much better\ncomparison to our HDF AGN candidates.\nSince this is not currently available, an alternative is to produce the LF of our sources\nusing the total integrated galaxy magnitude rather than the nuclear magnitude alone (dashed\nLF). The integrated galaxy magnitudes for our variable sources cover the same range as\nthe faint end of the local Seyfert LFs but have a number density 6\u201310\u00d7 greater than the\nlocal Seyfert density of UH01. If the AGN in these two samples cover a similar magnitude\nrange, this is evidence for a significant increase in number density from z=0 to \u223c0.7. The\nmagnitudes for the UH01 AGN determined in Ho & Peng (2001) for the Seyfert 1 population\ncover the range -9>\n\u223cMB >\n\u223c-22 mag with most lying within -12>\n\u223cMB >\n\u223c-20. Our nuclear aperture\nLF (open circles in Figure 9) extends from -14.5>\n\u223cMB >\n\u223c-19. In the most extreme case,\nbased on the over and underestimates of the true AGN magnitudes discussed previously,\nthe variable AGN in our survey could cover the magnitude range -12.5>\n\u223cMB >\n\u223c-20. This\nmagnitude range is consistent with that estimated for the UH01 sample. It is therefore\nunlikely that the increase in number density between the UH01 LF and our LF is due to the\ninclusion of instrinsically fainter AGN as appears to be the case for the difference between\nthe UH01 and HB92 LFs.\nFinally, we note that the LF for the variable nuclei continues to rise at faint magnitudes,\nindicating that number counts have not begun to turn over at magnitudes even as faint as\nMB \u223c-15. The effects of incompleteness in our survey due to AGN light dilution would cause\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nus to be less complete at the faint end and corrections in this sense would likely increase\nrather than decrease our faintest LF bin. Most local AGN LFs, such as those shown in\nFigure 9, show a flattening toward fainter magnitudes. The local LF of Londish et al. (2002)\nfor type 1 AGN reveals a much flatter slope at the faint end as compared to the bright end\nand can be well fit with a two power-law function. Our increasing numbers at the faint end\nmay be an evolutionary effect or might be attributed to the inclusion of a greater fraction\nof obscured AGN. More data are needed as well as better classification into AGN types to\nimprove the statistics and verify this trend.\n\n8.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated variability within the Hubble Deep Field North with the aim of\nidentifying low-luminosity AGN in the nuclei of field galaxies. We compare photometry\nof the nuclei of galaxies in the initial V-band image obtained in 1995 and a second image\nobtained in 2000 and find evidence for significant variability in 16 galaxies. Correcting for\npossible spurious detections and incompleteness results in a total of \u223c18 sources which make\nup 8.3% of galaxy nuclei to Vnuc =27.5. The galaxies hosting variable nuclei range in redshift\nfrom 0.09<z<1.8 with most lying between 0.4<z<1.1. Nuclear colors of the variable nuclei\nare consistent with those of non-variable nuclei.\nSeven of our variable sources are coincident (within \u223c1.2\u2032\u2032 ) with X-ray sources detected\nin the 2Ms Chandra exposure (Alexander et al. 2003). We find that 39% of the 2Ms Chandra\ndetections in the original HDF are significant variables. The optical variability observed in\nthese X-ray sources provides important evidence to confirm the presence of an AGN and\ncould potentially help discriminate between low-luminosity X-ray emitting AGN and other\nX-ray emitting phenomena such as supernova remnants or X-ray binaries. In addition, 44%\nof our sources are associated with mid-IR detections at 15\u03bcm and 31% are detected at\n1.4GHz.\nOptical spectra are currently available for 13 of the 16 variable sources. Object 2-251.0\nis a broad-line AGN. Two others show some evidence of harboring an AGN. Object 4-976.1,\na low redshift spiral, has emission line ratios indicative of a LINER/Seyfert 2 and 4-254.0\nreveals weak NeV emission.\nBased on the V/Vmax test, there is evidence for evolution within our sample of variable\nnuclei in the sense that more variables are found at higher redshifts. We estimate the\nluminosity function of variable AGN in the redshift range 0.4<z<1.1. This LF is a lowerlimit since our variability selection technique, employing only 2 epochs for detection, could\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nmiss \u223c20\u201325% of variable nuclei. The nuclear magnitudes for our variables extend to MB \u224315.0 with a median magnitude of MB =-16.3. Computing our LF with total integrated galaxy\nmagnitudes, we compare to the LF of Ulvestad & Ho (2001) for local Seyfert galaxies. If our\nAGN cover a similar magnitude range as those included in their sample, we find evidence\nfor an increase in the number density of faint AGN by a factor of 6\u201310 from z\u223c0 to 0.7. The\nLF for our selected variable nuclei continues to rise at faint magnitudes. Unlike the LFs of\nmost QSOs and local Seyferts, we do not see signs of flattening at the faint end.\nThe results of this paper can be tested and confirmed with a larger sample of variable\nnuclei detected at these redshifts. A similar variability survey is being conducted for the\nGroth-Westphal Survey Strip (Sarajedini et al. 2003) over 7 years and will produce a larger\nsample of variables to improve the statistical significance of any evolutionary trends. Additional future work includes the analysis of the currently ongoing GOODS HST Treasury\nprogram (Dickinson et al. 2003), an ACS survey of the sky around and including the HDF.\nThe 5-epoch survey, at intervals of \u223c45 days, will allow for the investigation of short-term\nvariability as well as providing confirmation and improved completeness for the variables\ndetected in this study.\nSupport for proposal GO-8389.02-97A for VS and GO-8389.01-97A and AR-7984.0196A for RG was provided by NASA through a grant from the Space Telescope Science\nInstitute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy,\nInc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.
