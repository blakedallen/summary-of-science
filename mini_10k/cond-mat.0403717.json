Physical implications of the observed phenomena are discussed.\n\nPACS numbers:\n\n1\n\n\fLight propagating in a random medium undergoes multiple scattering. As a result, it\nforms a complex interference (speckle) pattern when it emerges from the medium, which can\nbe described statistically[1, 2]. There exist longer range correlations, that can be detected as\ncorrelations between two distant speckles[3, 4]. These longer range correlations in transmitted intensities received much attention in context of mesoscopic electronic systems[5], where\nthey result in universal conductance fluctuations. For electronic systems only limited information (fluctuation of conductance) can usually be deduced from experiments. For light,\nhowever, momentum- (angular) and spatial-resolved measurements are possible. The latter\nyield much more detailed information about the system. The connection between electrons\nand photons is established by identifying the Landauer conductance g with the total transmission coefficient (summed over all incoming and outgoing channels)[5]. The majority of\nexperimental and theoretical efforts (see Refs. [1, 6, 7, 8] and references therein) to date\nare concentrated on systems in the regime of diffusive transport, g \u226b 1. The intensity\ncorrelation function (ICF) is defined as[7, 8]\nC(\u2206r, \u2206\u03bd) =\n\nhI(r + \u2206r, \u03bd + \u2206\u03bd)I(r, \u03bd)i\n\u2212 1,\nhI(r + \u2206r, \u03bd + \u2206\u03bd)ihI(r, \u03bd)i\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r and \u03bd are spatial coordinate and frequency respectively. When length L of the\nrandom medium is greater that its width W , C is invariant with respect to r, and isotropic[9]\nfor \u2206r, as long as one avoids the evanescent zone on the output surface[10]. Theoretically,\nbased on pairing of incoming and outgoing channels, three contributions to ICF have been\nidentified[3, 4, 7, 8]: short-range C1 , long-range C2 and infinite-range C3 . Deep into diffusion\nregime g \u226b 1 in a wave-guide geometry[7, 8] C1 \u2243 |CE (\u2206r, \u2206\u03bd)|2 \u223c 1, C2 \u223c 1/g and\nC3 \u223c 1/g 2, making the values of C2 and C3 small. Here,\nCE (\u2206r, \u2206\u03bd) =\n\nhE(r + \u2206r, \u03bd + \u2206\u03bd)E \u2217 (r, \u03bd)i\n.\nhI(r + \u2206r, \u03bd + \u2206\u03bd)i1/2 hI(r, \u03bd)i1/2\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fis the field correlation function (FCF). Essentially, the nonpertubative nature of the crossover\nfrom diffusion to localization limits the amount of information that can be obtained\ntheoretically[11]. The purpose of this letter is to introduce a numerical method for studying\ncorrelation functions (CFs) based on FDTD[12] algorithm. This method allows us to solve\nMaxwell's equations for electromagnetic field at every spatial grid at every time step. It\nmakes no assumption about the scattering strength, accounts for all interference phenomena, and makes it possible to obtain CFs in both diffusion and localization regimes. Here\nwe apply our method to systems with values of g from 4.5 to 1.\nWe consider a 2D system as shown in inset of Fig. 1: parallel plate metallic waveguide\nfilled with circular dielectric scatterers of refractive index n = 2 and diameter d = 1.4 cm.\nWe choose our parameters close to the microwave experiments of Ref. [13]. The scatterers\nwere randomly positioned (without overlapping) with a fixed filling fraction f = 0.3. Metallic\nwalls of the waveguide insured 99.9% reflectivity, and uniaxial perfectly matched layer[12]\nboundary conditions were applied outside the waveguide. A TM polarized broadband pulse\nwith center wavelength \u03bb = 2 cm (close to one of Mie resonances of the scatterers) was\nlaunched via a point source placed one wavelength away from the left surface of the random\nmedium inside the waveguide. A temporal discrete Fourier transform (DFT) was applied to\nelectric fields observed at a series of vertical planes separated by \u03bb/2 at the output end of the\nwaveguide. By virtue of DFT, we obtained the continuous wave response of the system for\na number of wavelengths \u03bbi within a 4% range of \u03bb. This range was significantly narrower\nthan (i) the width of the broadband pulse, and (ii) the range in which physical parameters\nof the system start to deviate from those at \u03bb. The distance between two consecutive \u03bbi was\nchosen to be equal to the average mode spacing. Spatial field and intensity CFs are obtained\nby setting \u2206\u03bd = 0 in Eqs. 1,2. We averaged over 48 configurations and 60 \u03bbi , similar to\n3\n\n\fthe microwave experiments of Ref. [13]. In addition, due to the invariance of correlations in\nthe empty part of the waveguide, we averaged over 10 observation planes. Up to 100 spatial\npoints equally spaced near the center of each plane were sampled depending on \u2206r. For\nspectral CFs, Eqs. (1,2) with \u2206r = 0, the averaging procedure is similar except that the\nnumber of \u03bbi sampled depends on the value of \u2206\u03bd.\nWaveguide geometry makes our system quasi-1D, where localization length \u03be \u221d Nl. N\nis the number of waveguide channels, and l is the transport mean free path. With an\nincrease of L, the system crosses over from diffusion to localization while l is kept constant.\nAccording to the diffusion theory the dimensionless conductance of a quasi-1D system g =\n(e)\n\n(\u03c0/2)nef f Nl/L\u2032 , where L\u2032 = L + 2zb accounts for the boundary effect[14], the extrapolation\n(e)\n\nlength zb is usually of order l, nef f = c/vE , vE is the energy transport velocity [15]. In a\npassive system g is equal to the Thouless number which is defined as the ratio of the diffusion\n(e)\n\nmode linewidth to average mode spacing[6, 16]. In our system, l = 1.8 cm, nef f = 1.77(see\nbelow). The width of the waveguide, W = 20 cm (N = 2W/\u03bb = 20) and lengths L = 20, 40\nand 80 cm yielded the values of g = 4.4, 2.2 and 1.1 respectively, and allowed us to study\nthe correlation functions near the onset of localization.\nzb can be determined by fitting the real part of spatial FCF with the formula\nCE (\u2206r) =\n\n\u03c0(zb /l)J0 (k\u2206r) + 2 sin(k\u2206r)/k\u2206r\n,\n\u03c0zb /l + 2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, and J0 is Bessel function of zero order. The imaginary part of CE (\u2206r)\nshould vanish due to isotropy[9], which is confirmed by our calculation in which its value was\nless than 10\u22123 . We derived the above expression in 2D following the 3D derivation of Ref.\n[17]. Eq. (3) gives an excellent fit for all systems studied with zb /l = 0.8 in Fig. 1. Absence\nof the deviation of CE (\u2206r) from the expression derived in diffusion regime becomes apparent\nonce one recognizes that CE (\u2206r) contains only information about short range correlations.\n4\n\n\f(e)\n\nIt reflects the correlations on length scale of l, which is much smaller than \u03be. nef f in the\n(e)\n\nexpression for g can be calculated nef f = (1 \u00d7 Wair + n \u00d7 Wscat )/(Wair + Wscat ), where\nWair and Wscat are the energy stored in air and scatterers respectively. Wair and Wscat were\n(e)\n\ndetermined numerically to give nef f \u2243 1.77. The physical parameter yet to be obtained is\nthe transport mean free path l. This can be done by fitting the spectral CF to the complex\nfunction[18, 19]\nCE (\u2206\u03bd) = qL\u2032 / sinh qL\u2032 ,\nwith q =\n\n(4)\n\nq\n\n\u03c0\u2206\u03bd/D(1\u2212i). l enters Eq. (3) through L\u2032 and the diffusion coefficient D = vE l/2.\n\nFig. 2 shows the fitting of the real and imaginary parts of CE (\u2206\u03bd), from which we find\nl = 1.8 cm. The half width at half maximum (HWHM) of |CE (\u2206\u03bd)|2 should coincide with\n1.46 times the diffusion mode linewidth \u03b4\u03bd = D/L\u2032 2 , at least in the diffusion regime. The\ninset in Fig. 2 shows that the obtained l and \u03b4\u03bd are consistent. A slight deviation in the\nsystem of g = 4.4 is attributed to its short length.\nThe spatial dependence of long-range contribution to ICF was derived in diffusion up to\n1/g 2 order[13]\n2\n\nC(\u2206r) \u2212 |CE (\u2206r)| =\n\n8\n4\n+\n3g 15g 2\n\n!\n\n1 + |CE (\u2206r)|2\n.\n2\n\n(5)\n\nFig. 3 shows both magnitude and normalized profile of Eq. (5). The numerically calculated\nC(\u2206r) \u2212 |CE (\u2206r)|2 , shown in Fig. 3, reveals that its spatial profile is independent of\ng. Specifically, the ratio of its value at \u2206r = 0 to that at \u2206r \u2192 \u221e remains equal to\ntwo. Stronger oscillations in the numerical data are likely due to the finite width of the\nwaveguide. However, the magnitude of the long-range contribution is significantly enhanced\ndue to localization effects, far beyond the diffusion prediction up to order 1/g 2.\nIn Fig. 4, as g decreases, the long range contribution to spectral ICF, C(\u2206\u03bd)\u2212|CE (\u2206\u03bd)|2 ,\nis broadened when \u2206\u03bd is normalized to \u03b4\u03bd. We ascribe this effect to strong fluctuations close\n5\n\n\fto the localization threshold. Namely, a few (more conducting) channels with larger than\naverage linewidth dominate ICF, leading to its spectral broadening.\nIn conclusion, using the FDTD algorithm, we studied field and intensity correlation functions close to the onset of localization. In this regime neither experiments nor analytical\ntheories have given such detailed information about correlation of intensities transmitted\nthrough a random medium.\nAY and HC are grateful to Azriel Genack and Boris Shapiro for their comments on\nthe manuscript and fruitful discussions.

Squares, circles and triangles correspond to the systems\nwith g = 4.4, 2.2, and 1.1 respectively. Solid curve represents the fit of Eq. (3) with\nzb /l = 0.8. The inset shows the geometry of our system.\nFigure 2. Real (empty symbols) and imaginary (full symbols) parts of frequency FCF.\nSolid and dashed curves represent real and imaginary parts of CE given by Eq. (4)\nwith l = 1.8 cm. The inset compares \u03b4\u03bd found from HWHM of |CE (\u2206\u03bd)|2 to D/L\u20322 .\nBoth quantities are normalized to average mode spacing. Symbol notations are the\nsame as in Fig. 1.\nFigure 3. The magnitude of long-range contribution to ICF versus dimensionless conductance g. Symbol notations are the same as in Fig. 1. Solid line represents diffusion\nexpansion formula Eq. (5) at \u2206r = 0. The inset shows long-range contribution to\nICF normalized to one at \u2206r = 0. Solid, dashed and dot-dashed curves correspond to\nsamples with g = 4.4, 2.2, and 1.1 respectively. Thick solid curve plots Eq. (5).\nFigure 4.
