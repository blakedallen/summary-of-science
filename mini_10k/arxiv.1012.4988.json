We consider a holographic cosmological model in which the infrared cutoff is fixed\nby the Ricci's length and dark matter and dark energy do not evolve separately but interact nongravitationally with one another. This substantially alleviates the cosmic coincidence problem as\nthe ratio between both components remains finite throughout the expansion. We constrain the\nmodel with observational data from supernovae, cosmic background radiation, baryon acoustic\noscillations, gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters, the history of the Hubble function, and the\ngrowth function. The model shows consistency with observation.\n\n1. Introduction\nHolographic models of late acceleration have become of fashion, among other things, because\nthey link the dark energy density to the cosmic horizon, a global property of the universe, and\nhave a close relationship to the spacetime foam [1], [2]. For a summary motivation of holographic\ndark energy, see section 3 in [3]. The cosmological model we present here assumes a spatially\nflat homogeneous and isotropic universe dominated by dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE)\n(subscripts M and X, respectively), the latter obeying the holographic relationship\n\u03c1X =\n\n3MP2 c2\n,\nL2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c2 is a dimensionless parameter that we will take as constant -though strictly speaking it\nmay slowly vary with time [4]-, and L = (\u1e22 + 2H 2 )\u22121/2 denotes the Ricci's lenght. We adopt the\nlatter because it corresponds to the size of the maximal perturbation leading to the formation\nof a black hole [5]. For models that identify L with Hubble's length, H \u22121 , see [6] and references\ntherein.\nThe other main assumption is that DE and DM interact non-gravitationally with each other\naccording to\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03a9X\n(1 \u2212 \u03a9X ) H = QH ,\n(2)\n\u03a9\u0307M \u2212 1 \u2212 2\nc\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03a9X\n(1 \u2212 \u03a9X ) H = \u2212QH .\n(3)\n\u03a9\u0307X + 1 \u2212 2\nc\nHere \u03a9M and \u03a9X stand for the fractional densities of the components, and the interaction term\n\u0012\n\u0013\nrf\n2\n1\n+\nr\n\u2212\n,\n(4)\nQ=\u2212\nf\n(1 + rf )2\nc2\n\n\fis such that ratio r \u2261 \u03a9M /\u03a9X evolves from a constant value at early times to a final, finite,\nvalue -denoted as rf - at late times (see [7] for details and Fig. 1). This clearly alleviates the\ncoincidence problem (namely, \"why are the densities of matter and dark energy of the same order\nprecisely today?\" [8]), something beyond the reach of the \u039bCDM model. A consequence of the\nmodel is that the equation of state of dark energy w \u2261 pX /\u03c1X varies with expansion as shown\nin Fig. 2.\n4.5\n\n\u03a9X0=0.707\n\nrf=0.013 c2=0.407\n\n4\n3.5\n3\n0.2\n2.5\nr\n\n0.15\n\n2\n1.5\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n0.05\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-1\n\n0\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n-0.5\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n7\n\n8\n\nz\n\nFigure 1.

Contrasting the model with observation\nThe model has four free parameters (\u03a9X0 , c2 , rf , and H0 ) which we constrained with\nobservational data from supernovae (557 data points [10]), cosmic background radiation [11],\nbaryon acoustic oscillations (at z = 0.35 [12] and z = 0.2 [13]), gas mass fraction in galaxy\nclusters (42 data points from x-ray measurements [14]), the Hubble function history (15 data\npoints [15], [16], [17], and [18]), and the growth function (5 data points from Table 2 in [19]).\n(See [7] for details).\nData from the growth function -which correspond to matter perturbations within the horizonare particularly relevant because they can more easily discriminate between cosmological models\nwith a similar history of the Hubble function. For the model under consideration the growth\nfunction of matter, f \u2261 d ln \u03b4M /d ln a, is governed by\n\u2032\n\n2\n\nf +f +\n\n\u0012\n\n1+r\n1\n+Q\n2\nc (1 + r)\nr\n\n\u0013\n\nf\u2212\n\n3r 3 + 2Q2 (1 + r)3 \u2212 2Qr(2 + r \u2212 r 2 )\n= 0.\n2r 2 (1 + r)\n\n(5)\n\nIn the non-interacting limit, Q \u2192 0, this expression reduces to the corresponding one of the\nEinstein-de Sitter cosmology, namely: f \u2032 + f 2 + [2 + (\u1e22/H 2 )]f = 3\u03a9M /2.\nThe best-fit values of the free parameters are found to be: \u03a9X0 = 0.707 \u00b1 0.009, c2 =\n+0.006\n0.407+0.033\n\u22120.028 , rf = 0.013\u22120.005 , and H0 = 71.8 \u00b1 2.9 km/s/Mpc. This together Table 1 and figures\n3 and 4 summarizes our findings. It is worthy of note that the non-interacting case, Q = 0 (which\nimplies rf = 0 via Eq. (4)), lies over 2\u03c3 away from the best fit value. This seems to be a generic\nfeature of holographic models.\nTable 1 shows the partial, total, and total \u03c72 over the number of degrees of freedom of the\nholographic model along with the corresponding values for the \u039bCDM model. The latter has\njust two free parameters, \u03a9M 0 and H0 . Their best-fit values after constraining the model to the\nsame sets of data are \u03a9M 0 = 0.266 \u00b1 0.006, and H0 = 71.8 \u00b1 1.9 km/s/Mpc.\n0.46\n\n0.025\n\n0.44\n\n0.02\n\n0.42\n\n0.015\n\n70\n\nrf\n\n75\n\nc2\n\nH0 (Km s-1 Mpc-1)\n\n80\n\n0.4\n\n0.01\n\n0.38\n\n0.005\n\n65\n\n60\n0.69\n\n0.695\n\n0.7\n\n0.705\n0.71\n\u03a9X0\n\n0.715\n\n0.72\n\n0.725\n\n0.36\n0.69\n\n0.695\n\n0.7\n\n0.705 0.71\n\u03a9X0\n\n0.715\n\n0.72\n\n0.725\n\n0\n0.69\n\n0.695\n\n0.7\n\n0.705 0.71\n\u03a9X0\n\n0.715\n\nFigure 3.

Conclusions\nThe statistical analysis sketched above shows that the ratio \u03c72total /dof is lower than unity for the\nholographic interacting model of section 1, whereby it is compatible with observation. However,\nas Table 1 shows, the \u039bCDM model fits better the same sets of data. Yet, the latter cannot\nexplain the cosmic coincidence problem while the former can.\nAcknowledgments\nID was funded by the \"Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Barcelona\" through a PIF fellowship.
