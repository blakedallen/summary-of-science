The boundary conditions describing the\ncontact interactions are dependent on the spin states of the particles.\nIn particular we investigate the integrability of N-body systems with\n\u03b4-interactions and point spin couplings. Bethe ansatz solutions, bound\nstates and scattering matrices are explicitly given. The cases of generalized separated boundary condition and some Hamiltonian operators\ncorresponding to special spin related boundary conditions are also discussed.\n\n1\n\n\fQuantum mechanical solvable models describing a particle moving in a local singular potential concentrated at one or a discrete number of points have been extensively\ndiscussed in the literature, see e.g. [6, 8, 14] and references therein. One dimensional\nproblems with contact interactions at, say, the origin (x = 0) can be characterized by\nthe boundary conditions imposed on the (scalar) wave function \u03c6 at x = 0. The history\nof this problem is well described in [6, 8]. It was suggested to divide these conditions\ninto two disjoint families: separated and nonseparated boundary conditions, corresponding to the cases where the perturbed operator is equal to the orthogonal sum of two\nself\u2013adjoint operators in L2 (\u2212\u221e, 0] and L2 [0, \u221e) and when this representation is impossible, respectively. Classification of one dimensional point interactions in terms of\nsingular perturbations is given in [19]. In the present paper we are interested in model\nfew-body problems with pairwise interactions given by such potentials. The first model\nof this type with the pairwise interactions determined by delta functions was suggested\nand investigated by J.B. McGuire and C.A. Hurst [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. The eigenfunctions\nfor the system of identical particles interacting via delta potentials are given by Bethe\nAnsatz. Intensive studies of this model applied to statistical mechanics (particles having\nboson or fermion statistics) by C.N.Yang and his collaborators lead to the famous YangBaxter equation [15, 30, 31]. It has been shown in [9, 20, 18] that N-particle systems\nwith three-body interactions do not have eigenfunctions given by Bethe Ansatz. In [3]\nthe integrability of one dimensional systems of N identical particles with general contact interactions described by the boundary conditions imposed on the wave function was\ninvestigated. It was shown that the N-particle system satisfies a Yang-Baxter relation\nnot only in the \u03b4-interaction case, but also for two other one parameter (sub)families, one\nwith nonseparated boundary conditions and another with separated boundary conditions.\nThis fact is not surprising, since the Yang-Baxter equation has been derived for particles\nwith boson or fermion statistics. Suppose that the system of N particles satisfies one\nof these statistics. Then the eigenfunction equation can be reduced to an equation in\nthe sector x1 \u2264 x2 \u2264 . . . \u2264 xN , since the value of the total wave function in the whole\nspace RN can be reconstructed using symmetry properties of this wave function. The\nboundary conditions on the total wave function are transferred into certain conditions at\nthe boundaries of the sector for the reduced wave function. In fact all three families of\n2\n\n\fboundary conditions obtained in [3] correspond to one reduced problem. Hence as far\nas particles with statistics are concerned the only difference between the three families\nis due to the symmetry properties of the wave function, i.e. the rule how the total wave\nfunction can be reconstructed from the reduced one. Considering particles without any\nstatistics the eigenfunctions corresponding to the boundary conditions from the three one\nparameter families the eigenfunctions can be calculated using Bethe Ansatz. In [5] it is\nshown that not only the models satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation have eigenfunctions\nof the type of those constructed following Bethe Ansatz. This is possible, since to derive\nYang-Baxter equation from Bethe Ansatz one has to use symmetry properties of the wave\nfunction determined by the statistics. The family of such model operators is described by\ntwo real parameters. One of these parameters is redundant in the sense that the operators\ncorresponding to different values of this parameter are unitary equivalent. It is shown in\n[5] that the redundant parameter can be interpreted as the amplitude of a singular gauge\nfield. Note that this parameter can play an important role for nonstationary problems. A\nsimilar problem has been studied in [12] but it was wrongly concluded there that the family of such models having eigenfunctions given by Bethe Ansatz coincides with the family\nof models satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation. This point has been already clarified in\n[5].\n2\n\nd\nThe family of point interactions for the one dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger operator \u2212 dx\n2\n\ncan be described by unitary 2 \u00d7 2 matrices via von Neumann formulas for self\u2013adjoint\nextensions of symmetric operators, since the second derivative operator restricted to the\ndomain C0\u221e (R \\ {0}) has deficiency indices (2, 2). In what follows we are going to consider\nonly the self\u2013adjoint nonseparated extensions that cannot be presented as an orthogonal\nsum of two self\u2013adjoint operators acting in L2 (\u2212\u221e, 0] and L2 [0, \u221e). The boundary conditions describing the self-adjoint extensions have the following form\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\u2032\n\n!\n\ni\u03b8\n\n=e\n\n0+\n\na b\nc d\n\n!\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\u2032\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\n0\u2212\n\nwhere\nad \u2212 bc = 1,\n\n\u03b8, a, b, c, d \u2208 IR.\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c6(x) is the scalar wave function of two particles with spin 0 and relative coordinate\nx. (1) also describes two particles with spin s but without any spin coupling between\n3\n\n\fthe particles when they meet (i.e. for x = 0), in this case \u03c6 represents any one of the\ncomponents of the wave function. The values \u03b8 = b = 0, a = d = 1 in (1) correspond to\nthe case of a positive (resp. negative) \u03b4-function potential for c > 0 (resp. c < 0). For\ngeneral a, b, c and d, the properties of the corresponding Hamiltonian systems have been\nstudied in detail, see e.g. [1, 2, 4, 11, 19, 29].\nFor a particle with spin s, the wave function has n = 2s + 1 components. Therefore\ntwo particles with contact interactions have a general boundary condition described in\nthe center of mass coordinate system by:\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\u2032\n\n!\n\n0+\n\n=\n\nA B\nC D\n\n!\n\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\u2032\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n0\u2212\n\nwhere \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u2032 are n2 -dimensional column vectors, A, B, C and D are n2 \u00d7 n2 matrices.\nThe boundary condition (3) can include not only the usual contact interaction between\nthe particles, but also a spin coupling of the two particles if the matrices A, B, C, D are not\ndiagonal. These conditions are similar to those appeared in [7, 21] during the investigation\nof finite rank singular perturbations of differential operators.\nThe matrices A, B, C, and D are subject to restrictions due to the required symmetry\ncondition of the Schr\u00f6dinger operator. In fact we should have, for any u, v \u2208 C \u221e (IR\\{0}),\nd2\nd2\nn ) \u2212 < u, \u2212\nu,\nv\n>\nv >L2 (IR, C n )\nL\n(I\nR,\nC\n2\ndx2\ndx2\n=< u\u2032 (0+ ), v(0+ ) > C n \u2212 < u(0+ ), v \u2032(0+ ) > C n\n\n<\u2212\n\n(4)\n\n\u2212 < u\u2032(0\u2212 ), v(0\u2212 ) > C n + < u(0\u2212 ), v \u2032 (0\u2212 ) > C n = 0.\n\u00bfFrom (3) and (4) we get the following conditions:\nA\u2020 D \u2212 C \u2020 B = 1,\n\nB \u2020 D = D \u2020 B,\n\nA\u2020 C = C \u2020 A,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u2020 stands for the conjugate and transpose. Obviously (1) is the special case of (3)\nat s = 0.\nIn the following we study quantum systems with contact interactions described by\nthe boundary condition (3), in particular, N-body systems with \u03b4-interactions. We first\nconsider two spin-s particles with \u03b4-interactions. The Hamiltonian is then of the form\nH = (\u2212\n\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u2212\n)I2 + 2h\u03b4(x1 \u2212 x2 ),\n\u2202x21 \u2202x22\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere I2 is the n2 \u00d7 n2 identity matrix, h is an n2 \u00d7 n2 Hermitian matrix. If the matrix\nh is proportional to the unit matrix I2 , then H is reduced to the usual two-particle\nHamiltonian with contact interactions but no spin coupling.\nLet e\u03b1 , \u03b1 = 1, ..., n, be the basis (column) vector with the \u03b1-th component as 1 and\nthe rest components 0.

In the region x1 > x2 ,\n\u03c8 = (P 12 u12 )ei(k1 x2 +k2 x1 ) + (P 12 u21 )ei(k2 x2 +k1 x1 ) ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere according to the symmetry or antisymmetry conditions, P 12 = p12 for bosons and\nP 12 = \u2212p12 for fermions, p12 being the operator on the n2 \u00d7 1 column that interchanges\nthe spins of the two particles. Substituting (10) and (11) into the boundary conditions\n5\n\n\f(9), we get\n(\n\nu12 + u21 = P 12 (u12 + u21 ),\nik12 (u21 \u2212 u12 ) = hP 12 (u12 + u21 ) + ik12 P 12 (u12 \u2212 u21 ),\n\n(12)\n\nwhere k12 = (k1 \u2212 k2 )/2. Eliminating the term P 12 u12 from (12) we obtain the relation\nu21 = Y2112 u12 ,\n\n(13)\n\nY2112 = [2ik12 \u2212 h]\u22121 [2ik12 P 12 + h].\n\n(14)\n\nwhere\n\nFor a system of N identical particles with \u03b4-interactions, the Hamiltonian is given by\nH=\u2212\n\nN\nX\n\nN\nX\n\u22022\nhij \u03b4(xi \u2212 xj ),\nI\n+\n2 N\ni=1 \u2202xi\ni<j\n\n(15)\n\nwhere IN is the nN \u00d7nN identity matrix, hij is an operator acting on the i-th and j-th bases\nas h and the rest as identity, e.g., h12 = h \u2297 13 \u2297 ...1N , with 1i the n \u00d7 n identity matrix\nacting on the i-th basis. The wave function in a given region, say x1 < x2 < ... < xN , is\nof the form\n\u03a8 =\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c6\u03b11 ,...,\u03b1N (x1 , ..., xN )e\u03b11 \u2297 ... \u2297 e\u03b1N\n\u03b11 ,...,\u03b1N =1\nu12...N ei(k1 x1 +k2 x2 +...+kN xN ) + u21...N ei(k2 x1 +k1 x2 +...+kN xN )\n\n+ (N! \u2212 2) other terms,\n(16)\n\nwhere kj , j = 1, ..., N, are the momentum of the j-th particle. u are nN \u00d7 1 matrices.\nThe wave functions in the other regions are determined from (16) by the requirement\nof symmetry (for bosons) or antisymmetry (for fermions). Along any plane xi = xi+1 ,\ni \u2208 1, 2, ..., N \u2212 1, we have\nu\u03b11 \u03b12 ...\u03b1j \u03b1j+1 ...\u03b1N = Y\u03b1jj+1\nu\n,\nj+1 \u03b1j \u03b11 \u03b12 ...\u03b1j+1 \u03b1j ...\u03b1N\n\n(17)\n\nY\u03b1jj+1\n= [2ik\u03b1j \u03b1j+1 \u2212 hjj+1]\u22121 [2jk\u03b1j \u03b1j+1 P jj+1 + hjj+1].\nj+1 \u03b1j\n\n(18)\n\nwhere\n\nHere k\u03b1j \u03b1j+1 = (k\u03b1j \u2212 k\u03b1j+1 )/2 play the role of momenta and P jj+1 = pjj+1 for bosons and\nP jj+1 = \u2212pjj+1 for fermions, where pjj+1 is the operator on the nN \u00d7 1 column u that\ninterchanges the spins of particles j and j + 1.\n\n6\n\n\fFor consistency Y must satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation with spectral parameter\n[30, 31],\nYijm,m+1 Ykjm+1,m+2 Ykim,m+1 = Ykim+1,m+2 Ykjm,m+1 Yijm+1,m+2 ,\n\n(19)\n\nor\nYijmr Ykjrs Ykimr = Ykirs Ykjmr Yijrs\nif m, r, s are all unequal, and\nYijmr Yjimr = 1,\n\nYijmr Yklsq = Yklsq Yijmr\n\n(20)\n\nif m, r, s, q are all unequal. By a straightforward calculation it can be shown that the\noperator Y given by (18) satisfies all the Yang-Baxter relations if\n[hij , P ij ] = 0.\n\n(21)\n\nTherefore if the Hamiltonian operators for the spin coupling commute with the spin\npermutation operator, the N-body quantum system (15) can be exactly solved. The\nwave function is then given by (16) and (17) with the energy E =\n\nN\nX\n\nki2 .\n\ni=1\n\nFor the case of\n\nspin- 21 ,\n\na Hermitian matrix satisfying (21) is generally of the form\n\n1\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nh2 = \uf8ec\n\na e1 e1 c\ne\u22171 f g e2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\ne\u22171 g f e2 \uf8f8\nc\u2217 e\u22172 e\u22172 b\n\uf8f6\n\n(22)\n\nwhere a, b, c, f, e1 , e2 \u2208 C, g \u2208 IR. We recall that for a complex vector space V , a matrix\nR taking values in Endc (V \u2297 V ) is called a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation without\nspectral parameters, if it satisfies\nR12 R13 R23 = R23 R13 R12 ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere Rij denotes the matrix on the complex vector space V \u2297 V \u2297 V , acting as R on\nthe i-th and the j-th components and as identity on the other components. When V is a\ntwo dimensional complex space, the solutions of (23) include the ones such as Rq which\ngives rise to the quantum algebra SUq (2) and the integrable Heisenberg spin- 21 chain\nmodels such as the XXZ model (R corresponds to the spin coupling operator between\nthe nearest neighbor spins in Heisenberg spin chain models)[10, 17, 22, 23]. Nevertheless\n7\n\n\f1\n\nin general h 2 does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation without spectral parameters:\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nh13\nh23\n6= h23\nh13\nh12\n. But (22) includes the Yang-Baxter solutions, such as Rq , that gives\nh12\n\nintegrable spin chain models (for an extensive investigation of the Yang-Baxter solutions\nsee [13, 16]). Therefore for an N-body system to be integrable, the spin coupling in\nthe contact interaction (15) is allowed to be more general than the spin coupling in a\nHeisenberg spin chain model with nearest neighbors interactions.\nWe now investigate the problem of bound states. For N = 2, from (12) the bound\nstates have the form,\n\u03c8\u03b12 = u\u03b1 e\n\nc+a\u039b\u03b1\n|x2 \u2212x1 |\n2\n\n,\n\n\u03b1 = 1, ..., n2 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere u\u03b1 is the common \u03b1-th eigenvector of h and P 12 , with eigenvalue \u039b\u03b1 , s.t. hu\u03b1 =\n\u039b\u03b1 u\u03b1 and c + a\u039b\u03b1 < 0, P 12 u\u03b1 = u\u03b1 . The eigenvalue of the Hamitonian H corresponding\nto the bound state (24) is \u2212(c + a\u039b\u03b1 )2 /2. We remark that, whereas for the case of the\nboundary condition (1), for a \u03b4 interaction one has a unique bound state, here we have\nn2 bound states.\nBy generalization we get the bound state for the N-particle system,\n\u03b1\n\u2212 c+a\u039b\n2\n\n\u03c8\u03b1N = v\u03b1 e\n\nP\n\ni>j\n\n|xi \u2212xj |\n\n,\n\n\u03b1 = 1, ..., n2 ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere v\u03b1 is the wave function of the spin part.\nIt can be checked that \u03c8\u03b1N satisfy the boundary condition (9) at xi = xj for any\ni 6= j \u2208 1, ..., N. The spin wave function v here satisfies P ij v\u03b1 = v\u03b1 and hij v\u03b1 = \u039b\u03b1 v\u03b1 , for\nany i 6= j.\nIt is worth mentioning that \u03c8\u03b1N is of the form (16) in each of the above regions. For\ninstance comparing \u03c8\u03b1N with (16) in the region x1 < x2 ... < xN we get\nk1 = \u2212i\n\nc + a\u039b\u03b1\n(N \u2212 1), k2 = k1 + ic, k3 = k2 + ic, ..., kN = \u2212k1 ,\n2\n\n(26)\n\nfor \u03b1 = 1, ..., n2 . The energy of the bound state \u03c8\u03b1N is\nE\u03b1 = \u2212\n\n(c + a\u039b\u03b1 )2\nN(N 2 \u2212 1).\n12\n\n(27)\n\nNow we pass to the scattering matrix. For real k1 < k2 < ...kN , in each coordinate\nregion such as x1 < x2 < ...xN , the following term in (16) describes an outgoing wave\n\u03c8out = u12...N ei(k1 x1 +...+kN xN ) .\n8\n\n(28)\n\n\fAn incoming wave with the same exponential as (28) is given by\n\u03c8in = [P 1N P 2(N \u22121) ...]uN (N \u22121)...1 ei(kN xN +...+k1x1 )\n\n(29)\n\nin the region xN < xN \u22121 < ... < x1 . From (17) the scattering matrix S defined by\n\u03c8out = S\u03c8in is given by\nS = [X21 X31 ...XN 1 ][X32 X42 ...XN 2 ]...[XN (N \u22121) ],\n\n(30)\n\nwhere Xij = Yijij P ij .\nThe scattering matrix S is unitary and symmetric due to the time reversal invariance\nof the interactions. < s\u20321 s\u20322 ...s\u2032N |S|s1s2 ...sN > stands for the S matrix element of the\nprocess from the state (k1 s1 , k2 s2 , ..., kN sN ) to the state (k1 s\u20321 , k2 s\u20322 , ..., kN s\u2032N ).\nThe scattering of clusters (bound states) can be discussed in a similar way as in [15].\nFor instance for the scattering of a bound state of two particles (x1 < x2 ) on a bound state\nof three particles (x3 < x4 < x5 ), the scattering matrix is S = [X32 X42 X52 ][X31 X41 X51 ].\nThe integrability of many particles system with contact spin coupling interactions\ngoverned by separated boundary conditions can also be studied. Instead of (3) we need\nto deal with the case\n\u03c6\u2032 (0+ ) = G+ \u03c6(0+ ),\n\n\u03c6\u2032 (0\u2212 ) = G\u2212 \u03c6(0\u2212 ),\n\n(31)\n\nwhere G\u00b1 are Hermitian matrices. For G+ = G\u2212 \u2261 G, G\u2020 = G, there is a Bethe Ansatz\nsolution to (16) with Ylii+1\nin (17) given by\ni+1 li\nYlii+1\n=\ni+1 li\n\nikli li+1 + G\n.\nikli li+1 \u2212 G\n\n(32)\n\nLet \u0393 be the set of n2 eigenvalues of G. For any \u03bb\u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 such that \u03bb\u03b1 < 0, there are\n2N (N \u22121)/2 bound states for the N-particle system,\nN\n= v\u03b1\u01eb\n\u03c8\u03b1\u01eb\n\nY\n\n(\u03b8(xk \u2212 xl ) + \u01ebkl \u03b8(xl \u2212 xk ))e\u03bb\u03b1\n\nk>l\n\nP\n\ni>j\n\n|xi \u2212xj |\n\n,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere v\u03b1\u01eb is the spin wave function and \u01eb \u2261 {\u01ebkl : k > l}; \u01ebkl = \u00b1, labels the 2N (N \u22121)/2 fold degeneracy. The spin wave function v here satisfies P ij v\u03b1\u01eb = \u01ebij v\u03b1\u01eb for any i 6= j, that\nis, pij v\u03b1\u01eb = \u01ebij v\u03b1\u01eb for bosons and pij v\u03b1\u01eb = \u2212\u01ebij v\u03b1\u01eb for fermions.\n9\n\n\fN\nAgain \u03c8\u03b1\u01eb\nis of the form (16) in each of the regions xi1 < xi2 < ... < xiN . For\nN\nwith (16) in the region x1 < x2 ... < xN we get k1 = i\u03bb\u03b1 (N \u2212 1),\ninstance comparing \u03c8\u03b1\u01eb\nN\nis\nk2 = k1 \u2212 2i\u03bb\u03b1 , k3 = k2 \u2212 2i\u03bb\u03b1 ,...,kN = \u2212k1 . The energy of the bound state \u03c8\u03b1\u01eb\n\nE\u03b1 = \u2212\n\n\u03bb2\u03b1\nN(N 2 \u2212 1).\n3\n\n(34)\n\nWe have investigated the integrable models of N-body systems with contact spin coupling interactions. Without taking into account the spin coupling, the boundary condition\n(1) is characterized by four parameters (separated boundary conditions are a special limiting case of these). Obviously the general boundary condition (3) we considered in this\narticle has much more parameters. The classification of the dynamic operators associated with different parameter regions is a big challenge. As we have seen, the case\nA = D = I2 , B = 0, C = h corresponds to a Hamiltonian with \u03b4-interactions of the\nform (6) (for N = 2). It can be further shown that (for N = 2) the following boundary\ncondition\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\u2032\n\n!\n\nI B\n0 I\n\n=\n0+\n\n!\n\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\u2032\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\n0\u2212\n\ncorresponds to a Hamiltonian H of the form:\nH = \u2212Dx2 (1 + B\u03b4) \u2212 BDx \u03b4 \u2032 ,\nd\n\u03c6), for\nwhere B is an n2 \u00d7 n2 Hermitian matrix, Dx is defined by (Dx f )(\u03c6) = \u2212f ( dx\n\nf \u2208 C0\u221e (IR/{0}) and \u03c6 a test function with a possible discontinuity at the origin.\nThe boundary condition\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\u2032\n\n!\n\n=\n0+\n\n2+iB\n2\u2212iB\n\n0\n\n0\n2\u2212iB\n2+iB\n\n!\n\n\u03c8\n\u03c8\u2032\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(36)\n\n0\u2212\n\ndescribes the Hamiltonian\nH = \u2212Dx2 + iB(2Dx \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2032 ).\nWe have introduced boundary conditions depending on the spin states of the particles\nand studied several special cases. A complete investigation of integrable N-body systems\nand Hamiltonian operators corresponding to the general boundary conditions of the form\n(3) still remains to be done.\n10\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S.
