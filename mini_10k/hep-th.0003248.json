[2, 1] has attracted a lot of attention from many quarters: from a\nphenomenological point of view, it is a new and fresh proposal to understand the hierarchy\nbetween gauge and gravitational interactions, while from a purely gravitational point of\nview it rises many interesting problems concerning the relation between bulk and brane\ngravitational phenomena. In any case, these models provide a new arena in which one can\nstudy new and old problems of Theoretical Physics.\nIt is worth trying to extend this framework. Here we will present generalizations of the\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) scenario which could be used as alternatives to KK compactification. They are solutions of the Einstein equations with arbitrary cosmological constant in\nd\u02c6 dimensions and lead to d = (d\u02c6 \u2212 1)-dimensional metrics which solve the Einstein equations with arbitrary d-dimensional cosmological constant. They have a property which one\nshould require of any framework with extra dimensions: when the d-dimensional metric is\nmaximally symmetric (and, therefore, is the lower-dimensional vacuum) the corresponding\n\u02c6\nd-dimensional\nmetric is also maximally symmetric (and, therefore, the upper-dimensional\nvacuum). This holds in any consistent standard KK compactification: vanishing matter\nfields and Minkowski metric in lower dimensions (the d-dimensional vacuum) correspond\n\u02c6\nto Minkowski times a torus metric in upper dimensions (the d-dimensional\nvacuum). The\nsame can be said of supersymmetry although there are subtleties that in many cases will\nmake impossible to define lower-dimensional supersymmetry.\nIn order to exploit these \"bulk\" solutions for dimensional reduction, we introduce brane\nsources, find the modified solutions and study the dynamics of gravitons in the new backgrounds. We also find the effective gravity actions and Newton constants in lower dimensions and study supersymmetry on the brane-worlds.\nIn finding the solutions with branes, we have to allow for cosmological constants that\nare piecewise constant functions, a fact which comes naturally when dualizing it. Therefore\n\u02c6\nwe consider gravity coupled to a volume-form field strength and coupled to a generic (d\u22122)brane action.\n\n1\n\nBulk Solutions\n\nWe are interested in \"warped metrics\" of the form4\nd\u015d2 = a2 (y) ds2 \u2212 dy 2 ,\n\nds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd (x) dx\u03bc dx\u03bd ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nR\u03bc\u03bd = \u039bg \u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nsolving the equations\n\nR\u0302\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 = \u039b\u0302\u011d \u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 ,\n\n\u02c6\nWe work in arbitrary dimension d\u02c6 with mostly minus signature. All d-dimensional\nobjects carry hats.\nd\u0302\u22121\nWe choose x\n\u2261 y as the spacelike holographic coordinate and thus, we split the {x\u0302\u03bc\u0302 } = {x\u03bc , y}.\nUnhatted objects are d (= d\u02c6 \u2212 1)-dimensional.\n4\n\n2\n\n\fwhere \u039b\u0302 and \u039b are respectively the d\u02c6 and d-dimensional cosmological constants whose signs\nare, in principle, arbitrary. We define \u011d and g by\n\u011d 2 = \u2212\n\n\u039b\u0302\n(d\u02c6 \u2212 1)\n\ng2 = \u2212\n\n,\n\n\u039b\n.\n(d \u2212 1)\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe solutions fall into two classes:\n\np\n\n\u0001\n\u00b1g 2 /\u011d 2 e\u011dy \u00b1 e\u2212\u011dy ,\n\n(1.4)\n\n(a) \u011d , g \u2208 R\n\na = g/\u011d cosh \u011dy ,\n\n(1.5)\n\n(b) \u011d \u2208 R , g \u2208 I\n\na = ig/\u011d sinh \u011dy ,\n\n(1.6)\n\na = g/\u011d cos i\u011dy .\n\n(1.7)\n\n1. \u011d 6= 0\n\na(y) =\n\n1\n2\n\nwhere the sign has to be chosen such as to make a(y) real. This is always possible except\nfor the case \u011d \u2208 I , g \u2208 R. In the other cases we have5 , with g 6= 0\n\n(c) \u011d , g \u2208 I\n\nIn this case, the coordinate y naturally lives in a circle of length\nWith g = 0 the only possibility is \u011d \u2208 R and\n\n2\u03c0\n.\ni\u011d\n\na = e\u00b1\u011dy .\n\n2. \u011d = 0\n\na = igy ,\n\n(1.8)\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhich means that we must have g \u2208 I.\nThe main property of these solutions is that, if g\u03bc\u03bd is the maximally symmetric metric\nin d dimensions with curvature given by \u039b, then \u011d\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 is the maximally symmetric metric\nwith curvature given by \u039b\u0302. The RS solution [2, 1] fits in the \u011d \u2208 R , g = 0 case: if g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd ,\nwe have upstairs (locally) anti-De Sitter (aDS). Other possibilities that we are introducing\nhere are: to have either aDS or DS both upstairs and downstairs, to have aDS upstairs and\nDS downstairs and to have Minkowski upstairs and DS downstairs. The most interesting\noptions (at least from the supersymmetry point of view) are the RS solution and the one\nwith Minkowski upstairs and DS downstairs.\n5\n\nThe case in which a is not real can be fixed by Wick-rotating y into a timelike coordinate.\n\n3\n\n\fIn any dimension, in absence of other fields, the gravitino supersymmetry transformation law will take the form6\n\u03b4\u01eb\u0302 \u03c8\u0302\u03bc\u0302 = D\u0302\u03bc\u0302 \u01eb\u0302 ,\n\n(1.10)\n\nwhere D\u0302\u03bc\u0302 is the aDS (\u011d \u2208 R) or Lorentz (\u011d = 0) covariant derivative7\nD\u0302\u03bc\u0302 = \u2202\u03bc\u0302 \u2212 14 \u03c9\u0302\u03bc\u0302 \u00e2b\u0302 \u03b3\u0302\u00e2b\u0302 \u2212 2i \u011d\u03b3\u0302\u03bc\u0302 .\n\n(1.11)\n\nThen, the Killing-spinor equation \u03b4\u01eb\u0302 \u03c8\u0302\u03bc\u0302 = 0 has the following solutions:\n1. \u011d 6= 0\n\n\u01eb\u0302 =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\ne\u011dy/2 + \u03c6e\u2212\u011dy/2 \u01eb+ + 21 e\u011dy/2 \u2212 \u03c6e\u2212\u011dy/2 \u01eb\u2212 ,\n\n(1.12)\n\nwhere \u03c6 = (g/\u011d)/|g/\u011d| and where \u01eb\u00b1 are two spinors that satisfy\n\u0001\nD\u03bc \u2213 2i g\u03b3\u03bc \u01eb\u00b1 = 0 ,\n\n(1.13)\n\n\u0001\nD\u03bc \u2212 2i g\u03b3\u03bc \u01eb\u0302 = 0 ,\n\n(1.14)\n\nD\u03bc being the standard Lorentz covariant derivative and \u03b3a \u2261 \u03b3\u0302a . These equations have\nmaximal number of solutions when the d-dimensional space is maximally symmetric.\n2. \u011d = 0. The solution in this case is any y-independent spinor \u01eb\u0302 satisfying\n\nwhere now \u03b3a \u2261 \u03b3\u0302a \u03b3\u0302y . In this case we had to take g \u2208 I and thus this is the d-dimensional\nDS covariant derivative. This equation has a maximal number of solutions when the ddimensional spacetime is DS.\nObserve that, although DS supergravity is inconsistent, any pure gravity solution of that\ntheory can be considered a warped compactification of standard (Poincar\u00e9) supergravity\nin one dimension more.\n\u02c6\nAlthough we have managed to reduce the d-dimensional\nKilling-spinor equation to a\nd-dimensional-looking Killing-spinor equation, this does not mean that we have supersymmetry in the d-dimensional space. In the \u011d 6= 0 case, we cannot have two different signs for\ng. Keeping only one means keeping either \u01eb+ or \u01eb\u2212 , but this truncation is only consistent\nwith d-dimensional Lorentz invariance when g = 0 (the RS case). On the other hand in the\n\u011d = 0 it seems that there is no problem to have DS supersymmetry. The supersymmetry of\nthe RS solution has also been studied in Refs. [3] and [4]. We will make further comments\non their results in the next section.\n6\n\nDepending on the dimension, we will have one or another kind of minimal spinors associated to\nrepresentations of the gamma matrices with special properties. This will never be an issue in what follows\nand our results can be adapted to all the cases of interest.\n7\nFormally we can also consider the DS case (\u011d \u2208 I).

(2.10)\ny=yn\n\nIn general the equations for the constants cn only have solution if all of them (and,\ntherefore, the tensions Tn ) have the same sign. In particular, a system with two branes\nonly has solution if both branes have the same tension. The exception is the g = 0 (RS)\ncase in which one can get solutions for arbitrary tensions (Eq. (2.8)).\nThe problem of finding the different cn 's does not show up if one considers an infinite\nperiodic array of branes and anti-branes with opposite tensions. We can restrict ourselves to a fundamental region bounded by two branes or anti-branes with an anti-brane\n(resp. brane) in the middle. The system is mirror symmetric with respect to the middle\n(anti-) brane and we can make a further Z2 identification that leaves us with a piece of\nspacetime bounded by a brane and an anti-brane in which \u039b\u0302 and \u039b are constant (and in\nwhich only one constant cn matters). In these conditions, taking as fundamental region the\ninterval y \u2208 [0, l/2] with an anti-brane placed at y = 0 and a brane at y = l/2 the warp\nfunction a(y) takes the same form as if there was only one brane in the whole spacetime:\n1. \u011d, g 6= 0\n(a) \u011d , g \u2208 R\n\n(b) \u011d \u2208 R , g \u2208 I\n\n(c) \u011d , g \u2208 I\n\na = g/\u011d cosh (\u011d|y| + C) ,\n\na = ig/\u011d sinh (\u011d|y| + C) ,\n\na = g/\u011d cos (i\u011d|y| + C) ,\n\n\u011d = \u2212\n\n\u03c7\u0302T coth(C)\n.

We can\nonly have supersymmetry on the brane in the RS case \u011d 6= 0, g = 0 and in the MinkowskiDS case \u011d = 0, g 6= 0 and imaginary. In these two cases the amount of supersymmetry\npreserved depends on the d-dimensional (brane) metric g\u03bc\u03bd . If it is maximally symmetric,\nthen there will be maximal supersymmetry on the brane.\n\u02c6\nGeneric branes generically break d-dimensional\nbulk supersymmetry.8 However, in\nthese cases, supersymmetry is not broken locally in the bulk, in between any pair of branes,\nsince there the metric has exactly the same form as in the absence of branes.\nOne may want to have unbroken supersymmetry globally, an not just in between the\nbranes. First, we need to be able to define the Killing-spinor equation globally. In order to\ndo this, we have to allow for a \u011d which is piecewise constant instead of globally constant (the\nmain characteristic of these branes is that the value of \u011d is different in both sides). We have\nimplicitly accepted this generalization in this section in order to find the solutions. On the\nother hand, one can use a dual formulation in which the cosmological constant is replaced\nby a d-form potential as in Ref. [6], an idea which will be investigated in Sec. (4). Once we\naccept this generalization, the necessary condition to have global unbroken supersymmetry\nis to be able to match the solutions of the Killing-spinor equation in both sides of a given\nbrane. Let us take, for simplicity, one brane placed at y = 0. Both \u011d and g change sign\nacross the brane. In the y > 0 side of the brane, the solutions of the Killing-spinor equation\nare those exhibited in the previous section. In the y < 0 side of the brane we find solutions\nof the same form, where, now, the spinors appearing in the general solution satisfy\nthe same equations but with the sign of g reversed. We need to set g = 0 which means\nthat in the second case all supersymmetry is broken unless we have a trivial solution.\nIn the first case, it is not enough to have g = 0 which brings us the the RS case again.\nIt turns out that we also need to impose the condition\ni\u03b3\u0302y \u01eb\u0302 = +\u01eb\u0302 ,\n\n(2.16)\n\non the Killing-spinor, which reduces supersymmetry to a half. This is the same condition\nwe would impose if we were orbifolding the space between branes.\nWe would like to stress that our results apply strictly to the cases we are considering:\nthe infinitely thin branes described by the above solutions which make the metric across\nthem discontinuous. Thus, our results do not contradict those of Linde and Kallosh [5]\nwho did not study just pure supergravity but included supersymmetric matter. In that\npaper the authors tried to find supersymmetric thick domain walls for which the metric is\nsmooth using consistent superpotentials but did not find any.\n8\n\nWe are not going to include sources in the supersymmetry transformation rules as in Ref. [3]. We\nthink one really needs proper \u03ba-symmetric brane-sources in order to study in a fully consistent way the\nsupersymmetric source problem.\n\n7\n\n\f2.1\n\n4-d Action and Newton Constant\n\nThe action from which the equations of motion Eqs.

In general, the inclusion of branes and the orbifolding procedure is necessary to have\nconfinement on just one brane (a2 has more than one maximum in the interval of interest).\nThe only exception seems to be the RS case. The DS to DS case (\u011d, g imaginary) deserves\nspecial mention because the holographic coordinate is naturally compact. No branes are\nneeded to make the graviton wave-function normalizable, although we do need them if we\nwant to think in terms of confinement. Some of the general results for a metric of the form\n(1.1) have also been obtained in Ref. [7].\n\n4\n\nA Brane action for the Randall-Sundrum Scenario\n\nA constant can be understood as the dual of a volume-form field strength. A volume-form\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n(i.e. a d-form\nwhich we will denote by F\u0302(d)\n\u02c6 ) is the field strength of a d \u2261 (d \u2212 1)-form\npotential \u00c2(d) . The equation of motion forces the dual of F\u0302(d)\n\u02c6 to be constant (or, more\ngenerally, piecewise constant). Thus, one can generically substitute a constant in an action,\nand, in particular the cosmological constant, by a d-form potential \u00c2(d) . The canonical\nexample is the rewriting of Romans' massive 10-dimensional type IIA supergravity, which\ncontains a mass parameter m, by a 9-form Ramond-Ramond potential to which the D8brane couples [6].\nThis implies a generalization of the theory since now one can have solutions in which\nthe value of the cosmological constant is different in different regions of the spacetime: this\nis precisely what RS-like solutions need. The discontinuities are d-dimensional topological\ndefects (domain walls) which act as sources for the d-form potential and can be interpreted\nas the worldvolumes of (d\u02c6 \u2212 2)-branes charged under the d-form potential (D8-branes in\nthe case of Ref. [6]). A worldvolume action for these branes should, therefore, contain a\nWess-Zumino term: the integral of the pullback of the d-form potential.\nAll this seems to work very well in the D8-brane case and, in fact, the rewriting in\nterms of a 9-form potential proves necessary and even crucial. It is natural to try something\nsimilar here. Therefore, we propose an action consisting in a bulk action containing gravity,\n\u011d\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 , coupled to a d-form potential \u00c2(d) and a bunch of standard worldvolume actions of\n(d\u02c6\u2212 2)-branes containing the above-mentioned WZ terms with dynamical coordinate fields\nX\u0302n\u03bc\u0302 , i.e.\n\n10\n\n\f1\n2\u03c7\n\n\u015c =\n\n+\n\nZ\n\nh\n\u02c6 p\ndd x\u0302 |\u011d| R\u0302 +\n\n(\u22121)d\u0302\u22122 2\n\u02c6\n\u02c6 F\u0302(d)\n2*d!\n\ni\n\n\u001a\nZ\nh\ni\np\nTn\nd\nij\n\u03bc\u0302\n\u03bd\u0302\n\u02c6\nd \u03ben |\u03b3n | \u03b3n \u2202i X\u0302n \u2202j X\u0302n \u011d\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 (X\u0302n ) \u2212 (d \u2212 3)\nn \u2212 2\n\nP\n\nd\n+ (\u22121)d! \u03bcn\n\nZ\n\nd\n\nd \u03ben \u00c2(d) \u03bc\u03021 ***\u03bc\u0302d (X\u0302n )\u2202i1 X\u0302\n\n\u03bc\u03021\n\n\u03bc\u0302d i1 ***id\n\n* * * \u2202id X\u0302 \u01eb\n\n\u001b\n\n(4.1)\n\n.\n\nThe field configurations that minimize this action satisfy the equations of motion for\nthe metric\n\u011c\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 +\n\n\u02c6\n\n(\u22121)(d\u22122) \u03bcn\n2*d!\n\nh\n\u03bd\u0302\n\u03bc\u0302\u03c1\u03021 ***\u03c1\u0302d\nF\u0302(d)\nF\u0302(d)\n\u02c6 \u03c1\u03021 ***\u03c1\u0302d \u2212\n\u02c6\n\n+ \u221a\u03c7\n|\u011d|\nthe d-form potential\n\u02c6 \u03bc\u0302 F\u0302 \u02c6 \u03bc\u0302\u03c1\u03021 ***\u03c1\u0302d + \u221a2\u03c7\n\u2207\n(d)\n\n|\u011d|\n\nP\n\nn\n\nX\nn\n\ni\n\n+\n(4.2)\n\nZ\n\nd \u03ben\n\nZ\n\ndd \u03ben \u01ebi1 ***id \u2202i1 X\u0302 \u03bc\u03021 * * * \u2202id X\u0302 \u03bc\u0302d \u03b4 d (x\u0302 \u2212 X\u0302n ) = 0 ,\n\nTn\n\n\u03bcn\n\n1 \u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 2\n\u011d F\u0302(d)\n\u02c6\n2d\u02c6\n\nd\n\np\n\n\u02c6\n|\u03b3n | \u03b3nij \u2202i X\u0302n\u03bc\u0302 \u2202j X\u0302n\u03bd\u0302 \u03b4 d (x\u0302\n\n\u2212 X\u0302n ) = 0 ,\n\n\u02c6\n\n(4.3)\n\nthe worldvolume metric (after some manipulations)\n\u03b3n ij \u2212 \u2202i X\u0302n\u03bc\u0302 \u2202j X\u0302n\u03bd\u0302 \u011d\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 (X\u0302n ) = 0 ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nand the (coordinate) worldvolume scalars\n\u22072 (\u03b3)X\u0302n\u03bc\u0302 + \u0393\u0302\u03c1\u0302\u03c3\u0302 \u03bc\u0302 (\u011d)\u2202i X\u0302n\u03c1\u0302 \u2202j X\u0302n\u03c3\u0302 \u03b3nij +\n+\n\n(\u22121)d \u03bcn\nTn d!\n\n\u221a\n\n|\u03b3n |\n\n\u03bc\u0302\n\u03c1\u03021\nF\u0302(d)\n* * * \u2202id X\u0302 \u03c1\u0302d \u01ebi1 ***id = 0 .\n\u02c6 \u03c1\u03021 ***\u03c1\u0302d \u2202i1 X\u0302\n\n(4.5)\n\nEq. (4.4) simply states that the worldvolume metrics are those induced on the worldvolumes by the embedding coordinates X\u0302n\u03bc\u0302 .

For only two branes with opposite\ntensions the Einstein equation is exactly the one in Ref.

In fact,\nassuming that the d-dimensional metric is Ricci-flat R\u03bc\u03bd = 0, the Einstein equations are\nsolved by the above warp factor if (\u03bc/T )2 = 21 d/(d\u0302 \u2212 2) which implies, as in Sec.

The brane breaks a half of the available supersymmetry in the RS case, a result\nalso obtained in Ref. [3], while in the last case a brane seems to break completely the bulk\nsupersymmetry although one can still speak of (DS) supersymmetry on the brane-world\nwith its known problems.\nIn analogy with the D8-brane effective action, we considered a formulation of the problem in terms of a dynamical d\u02c6 \u2212 2 brane with a d\u02c6 \u2212 1 form potential.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Bert Janssen and Pedro Silva for many useful conversations.
