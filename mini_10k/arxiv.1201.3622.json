We previously showed that in such systems, the dynamics of the giant planets introduces\na correlation between the presence of terrestrial planets and cold dust, i.e., debris disks, which is particularly pronounced at \u03bb \u223c 70\u03bcm.\nHere we present new simulations that show that this connection is qualitatively robust to a range of parameters: the mass distribution\nof the giant planets, the width and mass distribution of the outer planetesimal disk, and the presence of gas in the disk when the giant\nplanets become unstable. We discuss how variations in these parameters affect the evolution. We find that systems with equal-mass\ngiant planets undergo the most violent instabilities, and that these destroy both terrestrial planets and the outer planetesimal disks that\nproduce debris disks. In contrast, systems with low-mass giant planets efficiently produce both terrestrial planets and debris disks.\nA large fraction of systems with low-mass (M . 30 M\u2295 ) outermost giant planets have final planetary separations that, scaled to the\nplanets' masses, are as large or larger than Uranus and Neptune in the Solar System. We find that the gaps between these planets are\nnot only dynamically stable to test particles, but are frequently populated by planetesimals. The possibility of planetesimal belts between outer giant planets should be taken into account when interpreting debris disk SEDs. In addition, the presence of \u223c Earth-mass\n\"seeds\" in outer planetesimal disks causes the disks to radially spread to colder temperatures, and leads to a slow depletion of the\nouter planetesimal disk from the inside out. We argue that this may explain the very low frequency of > 1 Gyr-old solar-type stars with\nobserved 24\u03bcm excesses. Our simulations do not sample the full range of plausible initial conditions for planetary systems. However,\namong the configurations explored, the best candidates for hosting terrestrial planets at \u223c 1 AU are stars older than 0.1-1 Gyr with\nbright debris disks at 70\u03bcm but with no currently-known giant planets. These systems combine evidence for the presence of ample\nrocky building blocks, with giant planet properties that are least likely to undergo destructive dynamical evolution. Thus, we predict\ntwo correlations that should be detected by upcoming surveys: an anti-correlation between debris disks and eccentric giant planets\nand a positive correlation between debris disks and terrestrial planets.\nKey words. planetary systems: formation - methods: n-body simulations - circumstellar matter - infrared stars - Kuiper belt\n\n- Solar System - astrobiology\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Solar System's distinctive architecture, in which rocky terrestrial planets lie interior to gas and ice giants, with the Kuiper\nBelt of smaller bodies beyond, is not unexpected. The mass\nin protoplanetary feeding zones increases with orbital distance,\nbut the resulting tendency toward the formation of larger planets further out is eventually frustrated both by the lengthening time scale for accretion (e.g., Lissauer 1993; Kokubo & Ida\n2002), and by the increased ability of planetary cores to scatter planetesimals inward (Levison & Stewart 2001). The competition between these effects plausibly leads to the relatively\n\nslow (\u223c100 Myr) assembly of a handful of terrestrial planets\ninside a few AU, the faster growth of several planetary cores\nwith M & 5 M\u2295 inside \u223c10 AU, and the persistence of a\nbelt of unconsolidated debris further out. Simple arguments of\nthis kind fail to establish how often planetary cores grow fast\nenough to admit the formation of fully fledged gas giants, but\nempirical estimates based on extrapolations of radial velocity\nand microlensing surveys suggest that gas giant formation is\ncommon (Cumming et al. 2008; Gould et al. 2010). Debris disks\n(Wyatt 2008) are also observed around a significant fraction of\nyoung stars \u2013 despite the existence of both dynamical and col-\n\n1\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\nlisional processes that can destroy them on a time scale short\ncompared to the main sequence lifetime of Solar-type stars \u2013 but\nthe abundance of Earth-mass planets remains to be measured.\nFor the Solar System, we have access to a unique array of\nobservational constraints. Even with these advantages the exact nature of the interactions between the giant planets, the terrestrial planets, and the Kuiper belt remain under debate. In\nthe inner Solar System, at a minimum secular resonances with\nthe giant planets would have influenced terrestrial planet formation (Nagasawa et al. 2005; Raymond et al. 2009c). There could,\nhowever, have been stronger effects. Gas driven migration of the\ngiant planets could have brought them (temporarily) closer to the\nSun (Walsh et al. 2011), directly reducing the supply of raw material in the Mars region and preventing the growth of a larger\nplanet (Hansen 2009). In the outer Solar System, early studies\nfocused on the dynamics of Neptune, which is of low enough\nmass that inward scattering of planetesimals can drive substantial outward orbital migration (Fernandez & Ip 1984). The migration can deplete the mass in the Kuiper Belt and result in the\nresonant capture of Pluto and other bodies by Neptune (Malhotra\n1993). Subsequent work introduced the idea of larger-scale\ndynamical instability among the Solar System's giant planets\n(Thommes et al. 1999). In the most-developed models, early\nouter Solar System evolution is characterized by a combination\nof planetesimal migration, close encounters between planets,\nand resonant interactions (Tsiganis et al. 2005; Levison et al.\n2011).\nTheoretically, attempts to construct equally detailed models for extrasolar planetary system evolution are hampered\nby uncertainties in the distribution of the initial disk conditions, and by our poor knowledge of the evolution of gas\ndisks (Armitage 2011) and formation mechanism for planetesimals (Chiang & Youdin 2010). Several observed properties of\nextrasolar planetary systems, however, including the existence\nof hot Jupiters (whose orbits are sometimes misaligned with respect to the stellar spin axis) and the prevalance of eccentric\norbits, favor scenarios in which large-scale orbital evolution of\ngiant planets is the norm (Winn et al. 2010; Triaud et al. 2010;\nSchlaufman 2010). It is therefore of interest to determine the diversity of outcomes that could arise given initial conditions and\ndynamical processes similar to those of the Solar System, and\nto examine how those outcomes depend upon parameters such\nas the masses of the giant planets, and the properties of primordial planetesimal belts. Doing so is the goal of the present paper.\nWe are particularly interested in studying how terrestrial planets form, and debris disks evolve, in the presence of dynamically active giant planet systems. In an earlier paper (\"Paper 1\"\nRaymond et al. 2011) we showed that if giant planets form in or\nnear dynamically unstable configurations, there are striking correlations between the nature of the terrestrial planets that form,\nand the properties of outer debris disks whose ongoing collisional evolution can be observed out to ages of several Gyr (e.g.\nWyatt 2008; Krivov 2010). The dynamically calm conditions\nthat favor the formation of massive terrestrial planet systems\nalso result in long-lived outer debris disks, that remain bright in\ncold dust emission (e.g. at \u03bb \u223c 70\u03bcm) to late times. In systems\nthat suffer more dramatic dynamical evolution, we identified a\nchannel for the formation of unusual terrestrial planet systems\nin which a single planet exhibits large oscillations in eccentricity and inclination due to secular coupling to a scattered giant.\nHere, we consider a broader range of models within the same\nqualitative class, and study how robust our earlier conclusions\nare to changes in the poorly-constrained model parameters.\n2\n\nOur paper is structured as follows. In section 2 an outline\nof our methods is presented (the reader is referred to Paper 1\nfor more details and numerical tests). In subsequent sections we\npresent results of different sets of simulations to test the effect\nof: the giant planet mass and mass distribution (section 3), the\nwidth and mass distribution of the outer planetesimal disk (section 4), and the presence of gas during giant planet instabilities\n(section 5). In section 6, we discuss the implications of our models for debris disks and terrestrial planet systems. We conclude\nin section 7.\n\n2. Methods\nThe initial conditions for our simulations assume that the location and mass of the rocky material in the terrestrial planet zone,\nand the mass of planetesimals in the outer disk, are fixed at values similar to those employed in Solar System models. We assume that the masses of the giant planets, on the other hand, have\na broad dispersion (extending up to masses above those realized\nin the Solar System) that is uncorrelated with the mass in either\nthe terrestrial planet region or in the outer planetesimal disk. All\nof our simulations contain three radially-segregated components\norbiting a solar-mass star:\n1. The building blocks of terrestrial planets: 9 M\u2295 in 50 planetary embryos and 500 planetesimals from 0.5 to 4 AU, with\nequal mass in each component and a radial surface density\nprofile \u03a3 \u223c r\u22121 . The initial eccentricities were chosen at random from 0-0.02 and the initial inclinations from 0 \u2212 0.5\u25e6 .\n2. Three giant planets at Jupiter-Saturn distances: the innermost planet is placed at 5.2 AU and the two others are\nspaced outward by 4-5 mutual Hill radii. We adopt threeplanet initial conditions because this is the simplest plausible configuration that evolves dynamically to match the measured eccentricity distribution of massive extrasolar planets (Chatterjee et al. 2008). The planets were placed on initially circular orbits with randomly-chosen inclinations of\n0 \u2212 1\u25e6 .\n3. An outer disk of planetesimals thought to be analogous to\nthe primitive Kuiper belt. This belt consists of 1000 planetesimals with a total mass of 50 M\u2295 . The belt starts 4 Hill\nradii beyond the outermost giant planet and extends radially\nfor 10 AU, and also follows an r\u22121 radial surface density profile. f The initial eccentricities were chosen at random from\n0-0.01 and the initial inclinations from 0 \u2212 0.5\u25e6.\nAdopting these initial conditions amounts to making implicit assumptions about the typical outcome of planet formation. First, our terrestrial, giant planet, and outer disk zones\nare located such that they are in immediate dynamical contact\nwith each other. This is reasonable only if planetesimal formation results in a smooth, gap-less distribution of bodies in\n0.5 AU < a . 20 AU, and if giant planet migration is limited. Substantial giant planet migration, of the kind envisaged\nin models by Masset & Snellgrove (2001), Walsh et al. (2011)\nand Pierens & Raymond (2011), could create dynamical separation between the giant and terrestrial planets prior to the gas-less\nphase of evolution that we simulate. Second, we assume nonresonant initial conditions for the giant planets. Mean-motion\nresonances can be established readily if there is significant migration, due to either gas disk torques or planetesimal scattering, and a plausible alternate class of models could be constructed in which fully resonant initial conditions were the norm\n(Morbidelli et al. 2007). We do not consider this possibility further here.\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\nEmbryo and giant planet particles feel the gravitational attraction of all other bodies in the simulation. Planetesimal particles, both in the inner and outer disk, feel the gravity of embryos\nand giant planets but do not self-gravitate. This commonly-used\napproximation allows for an adequate treatment of collective\nparticle effects and dramatically reduces the required computation time. Our methods are outlined in detail in Paper 1. Here we\nsummarize the key points. Each simulation was integrated for\n100-200 million years using the hybrid version of the Mercury\ncode (Chambers 1999) with a 6 day timestep. Collisions between particles were treated as inelastic mergers. Particles were\nremoved from a simulation when they either came within 0.2 AU\nof the central (solar-type) star at which point they are assumed\nto have collided with the star, or ventured farther than 100 AU\nfrom the central star (1000 AU for the widedisk runs discussed\nin Section 4.2), at which point the particle is assumed to have\nbeen ejected from the system.\nIn Paper 1 we presented the results from our fiducial mixed\nset of simulations. In these simulations the giant planet masses\nare drawn randomly from the observed exoplanet mass distribution (Butler et al. 2006; Udry & Santos 2007):\ndN\n\u221d M \u22121.1 ,\ndM\n\n(1)\n\nwhere masses were chosen between one Saturn mass and\n3 Jupiter masses. In these runs, the masses of individual planets were chosen independently.\nWe also computed a number of alternate models in which\neither the range of the mass function, the assumption of independent masses, or the properties of the outer disk were altered\n(see Table 1):\n\u2013 The lowmass simulations represent systems with low-mass\ngiant planets. For these cases the giant planet masses also\nfollow the observed exoplanet distribution, but with masses\nbetween 10 M\u2295 and 1 MJup . The initial conditions for the giant planets in these lowmass simulations are the same as the\n\"mixed2\" simulations in Raymond et al. (2008a, 2009b,a,\n2010). Abnormally low giant planet masses, relative to\nthe mass in terrestrial planet-forming material, might occur\nphysically in disks around stars where stronger than average\nphotoevaporation limits the disk lifetime.\n\u2013 The equal simulations comprise four sets of simulations,\neach containing three giant planets with fixed masses of\n30 M\u2295 , 1MS at , 1M J , or 3M J . For the equal simulations the\nplanets were placed in a slightly more compact configuration (separated by 3.5-4 mutual Hill radii rather than 4-5)\nto ensure that they would become unstable. This variation\nmimics the reality that the conditions that favor the growth\nof one gas giant to high masses \u2013 for example early core\nformation or a long disk lifetime \u2013 probably apply also to\nother planets in the same system. Past work suggests that\nthese simulations should produce the most violent instabilities (Ford et al. 2003; Raymond et al. 2010).\n\u2013 The widedisk simulations test the effect of planetesimal\ndisks that are 20 AU wide rather than 10, and twice as massive (so that there is the same mass in the first 10 AU of the\nannulus as the fiducial case). In these simulations, the radius\nbeyond which an object is considered ejected was 1000 AU\nrather than 100 AU. The giant planets' initial orbits are identical to the mixed set.\n\u2013 The seeds simulations test the effect of the mass distribution\nwithin the planetesimal disk by including five or ten equallyspaced equal-mass fully self-gravitating seeds of either 2 M\u2295\n\nor 0.5 M\u2295 respectively. The total mass and width of the planetesimal disk was held fixed at 10 AU.\n\u2013 The gas simulations test the effect of the presence of a\ngas disk during and after the giant planet instabilities. (The\nmethodology is discussed in \u00a75.)\nEach simulation was post-processed to calculate the spectral\nenergy distribution of dust in the system following the method\nof Booth et al. (2009) with a few small changes (see Section\n2.3 in Paper 1). To do this each planetesimal particle was assumed to represent a population of objects with sizes between\n2.2\u03bcm and 2000 km. This population was assumed to be in collisional equilibrium such that the differential size distribution\ncan be written as n(D) \u221d D\u22123.5 (Dohnanyi 1969). The radial\ndistribution of dust was calculated by a simple combination of\nthe planetesimal orbital distribution (and by sampling eccentric orbits at multiple intervals along their orbit equally spaced\nin mean anomaly). The spectral energy distribution was calculated by assuming that the dust grains in each radial bin emit as\nblackbodies based on their effective temperature. At each simulation timestep the collisional timescale tc was calculated for\nthe largest objects (D = 2000 km) for the population of both\nasteroidal and cometary planetesimals. In practice, tc represents\nthe mean timescale between collisions energetic enough to disrupt an object of a given size at a given orbital radius. tc is a\nfunction of the mass, width, and orbital distribution of the planetesimal belt as well as the physical properties of planetesimals\nthemselves, in particular their Q\u22c6D , the impact energy needed\nto catastrophically disrupt a planetesimal of size D (for details,\nsee Wyatt et al. 1999, 2007b; Booth et al. 2009; Raymond et al.\n2011; Kains et al. 2011). Once tc was calculated for a given\ntimestep, the effective dust mass of each population was decreased by a factor of [1 + t/tc (Dc )]\u22121 . This decrease in the dust\nmass is not self-consistent because the planetesimal mass in the\nsimulations is constant. This effect can be important for the asteroidal planetesimals because their collisional timescale, tc \u223c 104\nyears, is short compared to the interesting timescales for dynamical evolution. The opposite ordering typically applies for\nthe outer, cometary planetesimals, whose collisional timescale\nis tc & 108 years. The dust fluxes used in the analysis later in the\npaper are dominated by the cometary component so this inconsistency has little to no effect on our results. In addition, for the\ncase of low-mass giant planets that migrate due to planetesimal\nscattering (i.e., the lowmass simulations), the timescale for dynamical mass loss from the outer planetesimal disk is roughly an\norder of magnitude shorter than the timescale for the calculated\ncollisional mass loss in that same region. Thus, our assumption\nthat the planet-planetesimal disk dynamics is not affected by the\ncollisional cascade appears reasonable for the outer disk.\nThis simple model is based on previous studies that fit the\nstatistics of debris disks using models for the collisional evolution of planetesimals (Dominik & Decin 2003; Krivov et al.\n2005, 2006; Wyatt et al. 2007b; Wyatt 2008; L\u00f6hne et al. 2008;\nKains et al. 2011). Our model agrees to within a factor of 23 at 24\u03bcm and 70\u03bcm with more detailed calculation of dust\nproduction during the collisional evolution (Kenyon & Bromley\n2008, 2010) and also with dust fluxes observed around solartype stars (Habing et al. 2001; Beichman et al. 2006; Mo\u00f3r et al.\n2006; Trilling et al. 2008; Hillenbrand et al. 2008; G\u00e1sp\u00e1r et al.\n2009; Carpenter et al. 2009). However, due to our incomplete\nknowledge of the physical properties of planetesimals, there remains uncertainty in the dust fluxes of up to an order of magnitude for a given system (see Booth et al. 2009). Our model does\nnot include outgassing from comets (i.e., outer disk planetesi3\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\nTable 1.

Thus, the dust\nfluxes that we calculate during planetesimal bombardments are\nsignificantly underestimated. Indeed, the 24\u03bcm dust flux during\nthe late heavy bombardment calculated by Booth et al. (2009)\nwith our method reaches a peak that is roughly an order of magnitude lower than that calculated by Nesvorn\u00fd et al. (2010), who\naccounted for cometary dust production. Cometary outgassing\nis of importance at mid-infrared wavelengths (10 . \u03bb . 50\u03bcm)\nduring and shortly after bombardments. As our results focus on\nthe steady-state production of cold dust in outer planetesimal\ndisks rather than on bombardments, we are not strongly affected\nby this effect.\nAn important point is the fact that our sets of simulations systematically over-predict the frequency of debris disks by a factor\nof roughly 2-4. Given Spitzer's detection limits, the observed\nfrequency of debris disks at 70\u03bcm around Solar-type stars older\nthan 1 Gyr is 16.4% (Trilling et al. 2008; Carpenter et al. 2009).\nAt 24\u03bcm, the observed frequency is much lower, only 2-3% for\nstars older than 300 Myr (Carpenter et al. 2009; G\u00e1sp\u00e1r et al.\n2009). Various aspects of and potential solutions to this issue\nwill be discussed in more detail throughout the paper.\n2.1. An example mixed simulation\n\nHere we briefly present a simulation from the mixed set to facilitate comparison against example simulations from other sets\nthat are presented in later sections. The chosen system started\nwith giant planets of 0.96, 0.46 and 0.64 M J in order of increasing orbital distance, and an outer planetesimal disk that extended\nout to 22.8 AU.\nFigure 1 shows the evolution of the simulation's dynamics\nand calculated dust flux. The system remained stable for 42.8\nMyr at which time it underwent a strong dynamical instability\nthat started with a close encounter between the middle and outer\ngiant planets that triggered a series of planet-planet scattering\nevents over the next 400,000 years. The instability culminated\nin the ejection of the middle giant planet, and the surviving two\ngiant planets swapped orbits (i.e., the innermost planet became\nthe outermost and vice versa). At the end of the simulation both\nplanets' eccentricities are large: einner oscillates between 0.61\nand 0.83 and eouter between 0.15 and 0.37. Despite their large eccentricities, both of the planets' inclinations with respect to the\ninitial orbital plane remain modest (at least in comparison with\nthe planets' eccentricities): iinner oscillates between 3.5\u25e6 and 14\u25e6\nand iouter between zero and 3.1\u25e6 . With a semimajor axis of 2.55\nAU, the orbit of the inner giant planet is well-represented by the\nmore eccentric of the known exoplanets, while the outer planet\nwould probably not be currently detectable.\nBefore the instability the inner planetary system was undergoing standard terrestrial accretion. Embryos' eccentricities re4\n\nmained damped by dynamical friction from planetesimals and\nembryos grew by frequent planetesimal impacts and occasional\ngiant embryo impacts. At the time of the instability the accretion\nprocess was relatively mature, as only eight embryos remained\ninside 2 AU with masses between 0.08 and 0.91 M\u2295, as well as\nthree smaller (0.07 \u2212 0.2 M\u2295) embryos in the asteroid belt. In the\nimmediate aftermath of the instability, ten of the eleven embryos\ncollided with the central star. The mechanism that drove the embryos into the star was strong eccentricity pumping by a combination of close encounters and secular pumping by the (initially\noutermost) inward-scattered giant planet. The one embryo that\nwas not driven into the star was the outermost one, which had a\npre-instability semimajor axis of 2.6 AU and was ejected after a\nseries of close encounters with the scattered giant planets.\nThe pre-instability outer planetesimal disk was for the most\npart dynamically calm. The inner edge of the disk was slowly\neroded during this period as the giant planets cleared out planetesimals that were unstable on long timescales. A few other\nresonances (e.g., the 3:1 resonance with the outer giant planet\nat 21.4 AU) also acted to increase the eccentricities of long-term\nstable planetesimals. A slow trickle of planetesimals was also\ndestabilized by certain strong mean motion resonances, notably\nthe 2:1 resonance. When the instability started, the (previously\nmiddle) giant planet was scattered out into the planetesimal disk\non an eccentric orbit. Its eccentricity was further pumped by a series of close encounters with the (initially innermost) planet such\nthat for a period of several hundred thousand years (several thousand cometary orbits) the giant planet's orbit completely crossed\nthe initial planetesimal disk. The outer planetesimal disk was\nentirely destabilized by secular interactions and close encounters. These planetesimals' eccentricities increased drastically until they either hit the sun (this occurred about 25% of the time),\nwere scattered out beyond 100 AU and removed from the simulation by presumed hyperbolic ejection (\u223c 75%), or collided\nwith a giant planet (\u223c 0.5%). More than 80% of the outer disk\nplanetesimals were destroyed within 500,000 years and 97%\nwithin 5 Myr. Only 23 planetesimal particles survived more than\n5 Myr after the instability on orbits that were unstable on 10\nMyr timescales, typically with high inclinations and eccentricities. At the end of the simulation a single planetesimal survived,\nalthough it is almost certainly unstable on longer timescales as\nits orbit crosses the outer giant planet's.\nThe system's spectral energy distribution (SED) \u2013 shown at\nright in Figure 1 \u2013 reflects its dynamical evolution. The asteroidal planetesimals are quickly ground to dust, as their collisional timescales are only 104 \u2212 105 years. This causes a rapid\ndecline in flux at short wavelengths (\u03bb . 20\u03bcm). The erosion of\nthe inner edge of the outer planetesimal disk causes a continued\ndecrease in flux at shorter wavelengths. The flux at \u03bb & 50\u03bcm\nis dominated by the mass in outer disk planetesimals and is only\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n0.01 Myr\n\n0.8\n\n1000.000\n\nStart\n5 Myr\n42.8 Myr\n43.5 Myr\n100 Myr\n\n0.4\n\n100.000\n\n0.0\n0.8\n\nFlux density, Jy\n\n1 Myr\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0.8\n\n10 Myr\n\nEccentricity\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0.8\n\n10.000\n1.000\n0.100\n0.010\n\n42.8 Myr\n\n0.001\n1\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0.8\n\n42.9 Myr\n\n10\n100\nWavelength \u03bb (\u03bcm)\n\n1000\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0.8\n\n100.0000\n\n43 Myr\n\n10.0000\n\n0.0\n0.8\n\nF/Fstar (25 \u03bcm)\n\n0.4\n43.2 Myr\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0.8\n\n200 Myr\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0\n\n0.1000\n0.0100\n0.0010\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nSemimajor Axis (AU)\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\nLog(Water Mass Fraction)\n-5\n\n1.0000\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n0.0001\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nTime (Myr)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n-1.3\n\nFig. 1.

When the instability occurs and the outer planetesimal disk is destabilized,\na large number of planetesimals are temporarily placed on higheccentricity (and therefore small-periastron) orbits which produce hot dust. This burst in hot dust changes the shape of the\nSED by increasing the flux at short wavelengths. This is the\ncause of the spike in flux seen at 25\u03bcm in the lower right panel of\nFig. 1. As noted already, the magnitude of the spike is underestimated because we do not account for the outgassing that occurs\nwhen an icy body is heated (see Nesvorn\u00fd et al. 2010). However,\nas the outer planetesimal disk is removed the flux drops dramatically. The dust flux in the 30 Myr after the instability is maintained at a relatively high level by a single planetesimal that survived from 43 to 66.5 Myr between the giant planets with a perihelion that dropped periodically below 3 AU (on a retrograde\norbit). This single close-in planetesimal produced enough dust\nto keep the system above the 25\u03bcm detection threshold during\nthis period. We note that our dust production scheme does not\n\nallow for the collisional evolution of a single planetesimal so its\ndust flux is certainly overestimated.\nThis example is relatively extreme in terms of the planets' final orbital eccentricities and in that all the terrestrial and\ncometary particles were destroyed. However, as we will see below, this simulation allows for a convenient comparison with upcoming examples because the instability is delayed and so the\nevolution of the dust flux from the quiescent outer disk is unperturbed at early times.\n\n3. Effect of the giant planet masses and mass\ndistribution\nWe now analyse two sets of simulations that explore alternate\ngiant planet mass distributions than the mixed set analysed in\nPaper 1. The mixed set included three planet systems with the\nmasses of the planets being chosen randomly and independently\nin the range between a Saturn mass and 3 Jupiter masses.

The size of each circle is proportional to the logarithm of the planet\nmass. The dashed vertical lines represent the median outer edge of the planetesimal disk for each set of simulations. Note that the\nouter edge varied from simulation to simulation depending on the giant planet masses, from 20.6 to 27 AU (with a median of 23.7\nAU) for the mixed simulations and 17.3 to 23.3 AU for the lowmass simulations (median of 19.7 AU).\nsame. We consider masses between 30 M\u2295 and 3M J for different\nsystems. Assuming that the masses within individual systems\nare perfectly correlated has the effect of maximizing the strength\nof dynamical instabilities, compared to systems where there is a\nrange in masses. In the lowmass simulations, planet masses are\ndrawn randomly from the observed distribution but only in the\nrange of 10 M\u2295 to 1M J (in contrast to the range of MS at to 3M J\nfor the mixed set). The inclusion of the lower mass planets increases the fraction of systems for which dynamical interactions\nbetween planets and the planetesimal disk are important. These\ninteractions can take two forms. First, \"planetesimal-driven migration\" changes the orbital radius of a planet due to the backreaction of planetesimals that are gravitationally scattered by the\nplanet, and thus changes a planet's orbital radius while maintaining a small eccentricity (Fernandez & Ip 1984; Malhotra 1993;\nHahn & Malhotra 1999; Gomes et al. 2004; Kirsh et al. 2009;\nLevison et al. 2010). Second, the orbit of an eccentric planet can\nbe re-circularized by \"secular friction\", a process by which an\neccentric planet excites the eccentricities of the outer disk planetesimals and causes a corresponding decrease in the planet's\neccentricity (Thommes et al. 1999; Levison et al. 2008). A lowmass planet can therefore be gravitationally scattered by another planet in the inner part of a planetary system and have\nits eccentricity decreased on a much wider orbit by secular friction with the outer planetesimal disk (e.g., Thommes et al. 1999;\nRaymond et al. 2010).\n\nThe low mass and equal sets of simulations are of particular interest because a combination of the two can produce an alternate sample that matches the observed exoplanet distribution.\nWe explore the two sets of simulations independently (sections\n3.1 and 3.2) and later combine them into a sample to compare\nwith exoplanet statistics (called case B in section 6).\n6\n\n3.1. Systems with low-mass giant planets (the lowmass\nsimulations)\n\nFigure 2 shows that, because of planetesimal-driven migration\nand secular friction, surviving low-mass giant planets populate\ndifferent regions of parameter space than more massive giant\nplanets. Given that all of our simulated giant planets started in\nthe 5-15 AU region, massive giant planets are only able to alter their semimajor axes by energy exchange during close encounters to essentially follow curves with perihelia or aphelia\nat the encounter distance. In other words, high-mass planets at\nlarge a necessarily have large e. However, low-mass planets can\nhave large a and small e by either 1) planetesimal-driven migration, which maintains planets' low e out to large a (to the outer\nedge of the planetesimal disk), or 2) being scattered outward in\na dynamical instability but having their eccentricities damped\nby secular friction with the outer planetesimal disk. Similarly,\nmassive planets that are scattered interior to 5.2 AU necessarily have large e but low-mass inner giant planets can undergo\ninward changes in a and survive on low-e orbits. Indeed many\nlow-mass planets do just that, ending up at a = 2.5 \u2212 4 AU.\nNote that secular friction is only relevant in unstable systems in\nwhich a planet acquires a large orbital eccentricity. On the other\nhand, planetesimal-driven migration is mainly relevant for stable systems although periods of migration may occur in some\ncases after secular friction has already re-circularized the orbit\nof a scattered low-mass giant planet.\nThus, the surviving high-mass giant planets retain a memory\nof their initial conditions: the stable planets and many unstable\nplanets are clustered at their original locations. However, given\nthe ease and inevitability of planetesimal-driven migration and\nsecular friction for low-mass giant planets, the initial conditions\nare erased.\nFigure 3 shows the evolution of a lowmass simulation with\ninitial giant planet masses of 12.4 M\u2295 (inner), 18.6 M\u2295 (middle), and 35.9 M\u2295 (outer).

Once interacting\nwith the planetesimal disk, the planet scattered planetesimals inward and migrated outward for roughly 20 Myr, then slowed\nwhen it came within \u223c3.5 Hill radii of the outer edge of the\nplanetesimal disk. As this represents the approximate boundary\nfor dynamical stability (Marchal & Bozis 1982; Gladman 1993;\nChambers et al. 1996), the number of planetesimals available to\nbe scattered by the planet decreased and the planet's migration\nslowed drastically. The planetesimals that were scattered inward\nfrom the outer disk were for the most part subsequently scattered\noutward by the inner giant planets, causing the two inner planets to migrate inward. However, some of the inward-scattered\nplanetesimals were trapped on low-eccentricity orbits between\nthe two inner giant planets and the outer giant as the outer planet\nmigrated outward by continued planetesimal scattering. This is\nsimilar to the mechanism that may have been responsible for\npopulating the Solar System's asteroid belt during the outward\nmigration of Jupiter and Saturn (Walsh et al. 2011). The inner\n\ngiant planets' inward migration was fueled by the planetesimals\nthat ended up with high-eccentricity, low-perihelion orbits after\nbeing scattered inward, although the inner giants also scattered\nsome embryos and planetesimals from the inner disk. The inner\ngiant planet migrated in to 2.69 AU but maintained an eccentricity lower than 0.1 throughout and less than 0.05 during the last\nphases.\nTwo terrestrial planets formed in the simulation shown in\nFigure 3: a 1.25 M\u2295 planet at 0.61 AU and a 0.69 M\u2295 planet\nat 1.11 AU. The eccentricities of the inner and outer planet are\n0.06 and 0.11, respectively, with peak to peak oscillation amplitudes of 0.11 and 0.20. The inner planet underwent its last giant\n(embryo) impact after 40.6 Myr but the outer planet did not undergo any giant impacts after 3.8 Myr. The inner planet is wet:\nit accreted a small amount of water from material that originated\nin the inner asteroid belt (an embryo and two planetesimals from\n\u223c 2 AU) but the bulk of its water came from a single cometary\nimpact. The outer planet did not accrete any material from beyond 2 AU and so is considered to be dry (see Raymond et al.\n7\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\n1\nNote that the plateau in brightness seen in the 25\u03bcm plot of Fig. 3\nmay be slightly overestimated because our method does not adequately\naccount for collisional grinding of bodies on extremely close-in orbits\nwhen they are isolated particles. In this case, these four isolated particles were at close enough distances to dominate the flux at wavelengths\nshorter than \u223c 50\u03bcm from about 80-120 Myr.\n\n8\n\nlowmass\n0.5\nFraction of Systems\n\n2004, 2007). The closest giant planet's semimajor axis is only\n1.6 AU larger than the outer terrestrial planet's but given the giant planet's small mass (19.2 M\u2295) and modest eccentricity (0.035\nwith oscillations of 0.02 in full amplitude) the system is stable.\nIn the simulation from Fig. 3, only a relatively small fraction of the initial terrestrial mass was incorporated into the two\nsurviving terrestrial planets. The majority of the initial terrestrial\nmass (57%) was ejected from the system and an additional 10%\ncollided with the central star. This contrasts with the unstable\nsystems with higher-mass giant planets, in which terrestrial material preferentially collides with the star (as in the simulation\nfrom Fig. 1). This difference is due to the fact that more massive giant planets pump the eccentricities of terrestrial bodies\nefficiently and can thus drive down their perihelion distances on\nshort timescales. Low-mass giant planets require longer to excite\nhigh eccentricities and also migrate in reaction to scattering such\nbodies, inward in this scenario. Thus, in systems with unstable\nlow-mass giant planets terrestrial material is more easily transported outward than inward, to be ejected after many encounters\nwith the outer giant planets.\nIn addition, in the simulation from Fig. 3 two Mars-sized embryos were scattered out and survived on distant orbits, at 29.2\nand 34.8 AU, and one embryo collided with the middle giant\nplanet.\nAt the end of the simulation there are two surviving planetesimal belts: a low-eccentricity belt between the two inner and\nthe outer giant planets and an outer disk of higher-eccentricity\nobjects exterior to the outer giant planet. The outer belt is analogous to the Solar System's scattered disk (Luu et al. 1997;\nDuncan & Levison 1997), having been scattered by the outwardmigrating giant planet. The scattered belt contains 3.7 M\u2295 in 72\nparticles with a median eccentricity of 0.27 and a median inclination of 11.5\u25e6 . This scattered disk also contains two embryos\nfrom the inner disk, including one that originated inside 2 AU.\nThe inner belt of planetesimals \u2013 located between roughly 8 and\n14 AU \u2013 contains 1.3 M\u2295 in 27 planetesimals with a median eccentricity of 0.12 and a median inclination of 16.8\u25e6 . The orbital\ndistributions and surface densities of these two populations are\nquite different, and we suspect that a wide diversity of planetesimal belt structures must exist around other stars.\nThe evolution of the system's dust brightness is shown in\nFigure 3. The SED of the system decreases systematically as the\nsystem loses mass, but changes shape after roughly 80 Myr when\nfour separate icy planetesimals entered the very inner planetary\nsystem and remained on orbits interior to the innermost giant\nplanet (with perihelion distances as small as 0.3 AU) for several\ntens of Myr before being ejected.1 At wavelengths longer than\n\u223c 50\u03bcm, the dust brightness decreased monotonically in time.\nHowever, shorter wavelengths (such as 25\u03bcm; Fig. 3) show the\nadditional structure caused by the icy planetesimals entering the\ninner planetary system because they are sensitive to hot dust.\nAs a whole, the lowmass simulations were extremely efficient at forming terrestrial planets and also at creating longlasting debris disks. Out of the 86 total simulations, 82 (95.3%)\nformed terrestrial planet systems containing a total of at least\n0.5 M\u2295 . Of the four remaining systems, three destroyed their\nterrestrial planets entirely and the fourth formed a single planet\n\n0.4\n\nunstable\nstable\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4+\nNumber of terrestrial planets (>0.05 MEarth)\n\nFig. 4.

Of the 86 lowmass simulations, 76 (88.4%) were\nabove the Spitzer detection threshold at 70\u03bcm after 1 Gyr (73\nremained bright after 3 Gyr; recall that this is far higher than\nthe observed frequency of 16.4%). Of the 54 (62.7%) unstable\nsimulations, only 4 did not yield at least 0.5 M\u2295 in terrestrial\nplanets and only 10 were not detectable at 70\u03bcm after 1 Gyr.\nThe few systems with destructive instabilities were those that\nby chance contained several massive planets, and so essentially\noverlapped with the mixed distribution. Figure 4 shows that all\n32 stable simulations finished with two or more terrestrial planets and also with bright debris disks. Note that in this figure we\nuse a low mass cutoff of just 0.05 M\u2295 in our definition of a terrestrial planet. Any surviving planetary embryo is therefore considered a planet. This allows for a consistent comparison with\nother sets of simulations including more violent instabilities (like\nthe equal simulations) in which surviving embryos are common. In the Solar System, Mars is thought to be a surviving embryo (Dauphas & Pourmand 2011).\nAmong systems with planets less massive than 50-100 M\u2295\n(\u2248 0.5 \u2212 1MS at ), there was little difference in the final outcome between systems that underwent planet-planet scattering\nand those that did not. This is because the planetesimal disk provides strong enough damping to quickly decrease the planets'\neccentricities back to near zero. Systems containing a single relatively massive giant planet (M & MS at ) also ended in a dynamically calm state because instabilities caused the lower-mass giant\nplanets to be scattered and, again, their eccentricities and inclinations are quickly damped. The only situation that preserved\nlarge eccentricities was the relatively infrequent combination of\nmultiple massive giant planets in the same system. In those systems the large eccentricity caused by strong scattering between\ngiant planets could not be damped (the low-mass giant planets\nin such systems are usually scattered, sometimes to be ejected or\nsometimes re-circularized in the outer planetesimal disk). Thus,\nunlike massive giant planets, the eccentricities of low-mass planets do not retain a memory of the system's dynamical history.\nIn addition, multiple giant planets must exist in the same system to yield eccentric giant planets. The abundance of observed\neccentric planets (e.g. Wright et al. 2009) thus points to the fre-\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n10\n20 30 50\n100\n200 300\nMass of outermost giant planet (Earths)\n\n1.0\nFraction of stable zones that\ncontain planetesimals\n\nFraction of stable zones that\ncontain planetesimals\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nWidth of stable zone \u2206 (mutual Hill radii)\n\nFig. 5.

The dashed line marks the two planet stability boundary (Marchal & Bozis 1982; Gladman 1993).\nquency of strong instabilities (although alternate models exist;\nsee Ford & Rasio 2008, for a thorough review).\nMost of the lowmass systems have large gaps between giant planets, and many of these gaps contain planetesimals on\nstable orbits, such as the belt between 8-14 AU in the system\nfrom Fig. 3. The existence of isolated belts alters the radial distribution of dust and can be inferred from the spectral energy\ndistribution. There are several systems known to contain belts of\ndust that appear to be radially confined, presumably by known or\nas-yet undetected planets (e.g., Beichman et al. 2005; Lisse et al.\n2008; Su et al. 2009).\nThe majority of the lowmass systems (60/85 = 71%) have\ngaps between the outer two giant planets with separations \u2206 of\n10 or more mutual Hill radii (in one system just a single giant planet survived and so is not counted).\u221aGiven that two planets must be separated by at least \u2206 > 2 3 \u2248 3.5 mutual Hill\nradii for long-term dynamical stability (Marchal & Bozis 1982;\nGladman 1993), the existence of a zone between two planets'\norbits that is stable for planetesimals requires at a minimum an\ninterplanetary separation \u2206 & 10. In practice, somewhat wider\ngaps are needed in realistic systems. The separation between\nSaturn and Uranus, and between Uranus and Neptune, amounts\nto 14 mutual Hill radii, and there is only a small region that\nis stable over long timescales between the latter two planets\n(Holman & Wisdom 1993). In our runs we frequently find gaps\nthat are not only wider than their Solar System counterparts, but\nwhich are also populated with primordial material despite the\nrelatively coarse sampling of the outer planetesimal disk population. The lowmass simulations yield a range of separations from\n\u2206 = 3.9 to 30 and outer giant planet masses of 11 M\u2295 to 0.97M J .\nFrom the entire sample, the stable zone between the outer two giant planets contained at least one particle in half of all lowmass\nsimulations (38/85 = 45%, although 5 stable zones contained\njust a single planetesimal). The closest separation between two\nplanets for which planetesimals existed on stable orbits between\nthe two was \u2206 = 11.9, and the widest separation for which no\nplanetesimals existed between two planets was \u2206 = 21.5. The\n\ntotal mass in these planetesimal belts ranged from the mass of\none planetesimal particle (0.05 M\u2295) to 5.9 M\u2295 , and in one case\nan embryo from the inner disk survived in such a belt.\nThe two most important factors that determine whether a stable zone between outer giant planets contains a planetesimal belt\nare first, the width of the stable zone and second, the mass of the\noutermost giant planet. Figure 5 shows that the probability that\na stable zone contains at least one planetesimal particle on an\norbit that is stable for long timescales ( i.e., whose orbit does not\ncome within 4 Hill radii of any giant planet's orbit) as a function of the mass of the outermost giant planet and the width\nof the stable zones (as quantified by \u2206). Stable zones are preferentially filled for larger \u2206 values simply because there is a\nlarger region of parameter space into which planetesimals can\nbe scattered and survive, and the fraction of stable zones that is\nfilled increases dramatically for \u2206 & 15. Stable zones are also\npreferentially filled in systems with outermost giant planets less\nmassive than \u223c 50 M\u2295, and almost 100% of stable zones are\nfilled when the outermost giant planet is less than about 20 M\u2295\n(FIg. 5). As they interact with the outer planetesimal disk, lowermass planets scatter planetesimals onto lower eccentricities than\ndo higher-mass planets, and these planetesimals are more likely\nto avoid encountering giant planets and to remain on stable orbits\nthan if their obits are more eccentric.\nDo other system parameters influence the probability that a\nstable zone between giant planets will contain planetesimals?\nWe tested the importance of several other parameters using a\nsuite of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests that compared different characteristics of stable zones with and without planetesimals. Using a cutoff of p < 0.01 for a statistically significant difference between the two populations, we found that five parameters influence whether a stable zone will contain planetesimals.\nIn order of most important (lowest p value) to least important\n(highest p value), these are 1) the width of the stable zone (\u2206),\n2) the mass of the outermost giant planet, 3) the semimajor axis\nof the outermost giant planet, 4) the mass ratio of the outer two\ngiant planets (systems with a large inner/outer mass ratio pref9\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\nequal\n0.7\nFraction of Systems\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\nM = MSat to 3 MJup\nM = 30 MEarth\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4+\nNumber of terrestrial planets (>0.05 MEarth)\n\nFig. 6.

The effect of these five\nparameters is statistically significant, although several are correlated (e.g., \u2206 correlates with the semimajor axis of the outermost\ngiant planet, although \u2206 is about three orders of magnitude more\nimportant in determining whether a stable zone will be filled).\nWe tested five additional parameters whose effect turned out to\nbe unimportant (p > 0.1 in each case): the mass and semimajor\naxis of the giant planet marking the inner boundary of the stable zone, the eccentricity of the outermost giant planet, and the\nmass-weighted eccentricities of all surviving giant planets.\n3.2. Systems with equal-mass giant planets (the equal\nsimulations)\n\nWhile the lowmass simulations represent a calm environment\nconducive to the production of both terrestrial planets and\nbright debris disks, the equal simulations were destructive on\nboth counts. This is simply because scattering among equalmass giant planets is the most violent planet-planet instability (Raymond et al. 2010), and strong instabilities destroy small\nbodies in both the inner and outer disks, typically by driving\na large fraction of inner bodies into the central star and ejecting the majority of outer bodies. Indeed, the eccentricity distribution of the surviving equal giant planets with masses of\nMS at or larger was skewed toward higher values than the mixed\nsample, reaching values as high as 0.89 and with a median of\n0.35 (compared with 0.21 for the mixed giant planets). An exception to this rule are systems with equal-mass giant planets\nthat are themselves low-mass. In systems containing three giant planets of 30 M\u2295 , the outcome was similar to the lowmass\nsystems because planet-disk interactions trumped planet-planet\nscattering. Indeed, the low-mass equal systems were dominated\nby planetesimal-driven migration of the outer giant planet and\nbehaved very similarly to the lowmass simulations. Given this\nstrong dichotomy, we now consider just the high-mass equal\nsimulations, as the lower-mass cases are more appropriately included with the lowmass set.\n10\n\nFigure 6 shows that, of the 53 simulations with giant planet\nmasses of MS at , M J , or 3M J , 36 (68%) destroyed all terrestrial material. Five simulations (9%) formed a single terrestrial planet, although these were all small, roughly Mars-mass\n\u223c 0.1 M\u2295 planets, and 4/5 of these were lone surviving embryos. The remaining 12 simulations with high-mass giant planets (21%) formed two or more terrestrial planets. In contrast, not\na single simulations with a 30 M\u2295 giant planet destroyed all of its\nterrestrial material. Rather, these systems usually formed several\nterrestrial planets \u2013 only 3/15 systems formed just one.\nOf the 53 equal systems, only 17 (32%) contained detectable amounts of cold dust at 70\u03bcm after 1 Gyr (only 14/53\n= 26% after 3 Gyr, although again note that this is higher than\nthe observed frequency of 16.4%). Of the 17 systems with detectable dust at 1 Gyr, 11 (65%) formed terrestrial planets. Of\nthe 36 systems with no detectable dust, only 6 (17%) formed terrestrial planets. Thus, there exists a natural connection between\ndebris disks and terrestrial planets that spans the domain of giant planet mass. This same debris disk-terrestrial planet correlation was found in Paper 1 for the mixed simulations. The details\nof this correlation depend on the system parameters and are of\ncourse confined to the context of our initial conditions, in particular to systems with relatively massive outer planetesimal disks\n(see discussion in Section 6).\nThe equal systems are violently unstable by construction and so the outcomes tend to be extreme. This is\nprecisely the type of behavior that is required by exoplanet observations, in particular the trend for more massive planets to have more eccentric orbits than lowermass planets (Jones et al. 2006; Ribas & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2007;\nWright et al. 2009; Raymond et al. 2010). If planet masses\nwithin individual planetary systems were random (as in the\nmixed simulations), then lower-mass giant planets should have\nhigher eccentricities than higher-mass giants (Raymond et al.\n2010); this is the opposite of what is observed. Thus, the equal\nsimulations provide a key ingredient in constructing a sample of\nsimulations that matches the observed giant exoplanets, as discussed in Section 6.\n\n4. Effect of the properties of outer planetesimal\ndisks\nWe now turn our attention to the effect of the properties of outer\nplanetesimal disks. We first examine the seeds simulations \u2013\nsubdivided into the bigseed and smallseed sets \u2013 that contained a population of \u223cEarth-mass embryos in their outer planetesimal disks. We then test the effects of doubling the width\n(and total mass) of the planetesimal disk in the widedisk simulations.\n4.1. The mass distribution of the planetesimal disk (the\nseeds simulations)\n\nIn the seeds simulations a small number of fully-interacting\nmassive bodies were included in the outer planetesimal disk\n(in contrast to planetesimal particles, which interact gravitationally with massive bodies but not with each other). The disk\nmaintained the same total mass and numerical resolution (the\nmasses of individual planetesimals were decreased to maintain a constant total mass). In 50 simulations comprising the\nbigseed set, five icy embryos of 2 M\u2295 each were included at\n11, 13, 15, 17 and 19 AU. In 50 additional smallseed simulations 10 seeds of 0.5 M\u2295 each were spaced with 1 AU of sep-\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\naration from 10.5 to 19.5 AU. These seed masses are broadly\nconsistent with calculations of accretion in outer planetesimal\ndisks (Kenyon & Bromley 2008, 2010).\nFigure 7 shows the evolution of one bigseed simulation that\nbecame unstable after a long delay and therefore allows for a\ncomparison with the evolution of both stable (prior to the instability) and unstable systems. The evolution is qualitatively similar to the mixed simulations in the inner disk such as the system from Fig. 1, as embryos maintain smaller eccentricities than\nplanetesimals via dynamical friction and accrete as their feeding zones begin to overlap. The instability started after 55.35\nMyr with a close encounter between the two outer giant planets. After a series of close encounters lasting 40,000 years, the\nmiddle giant planet was ejected. At the end of the simulation,\nthe system contains two giant planets each with e \u2248 0.3 and\ntwo roughly Earth-sized terrestrial terrestrial planets (details in\ncaption of Fig. 7).\nThe evolution of the outer disk differs significantly from simulations without seeds. The presence of the seeds introduces an\neffective viscosity into the outer planetesimal disk that is driven\nby scattering of planetesimals by close encounters with the icy\nembryos. This causes the disk to spread out radially. Within 1\nMyr the outer edge of the low-eccentricity portion of the disk\nhas expanded from 22 to 26 AU, and beyond 30 AU in the next\nfew Myr (Fig. 7). This outward expansion is balanced by the loss\nof a large portion of the total disk mass that is scattered inward to\nencounter the giant planets and be ejected from the system. The\nplanetesimal disk is further depleted on a 20-50 Myr timescale\nby instabilities in the system of icy embryos that increases their\neccentricities \u2013 these instabilities are analogous to but far weaker\nthan instabilities between the giant planets (and are weaker still\nin the smallseeds systems). When the giant planets go unstable the bulk of the planetesimal disk is rapidly ejected and the\nlast icy planetesimal is removed just after 100 Myr.\nThe dust production in the seeds simulations is also different than in simulations with calmer planetesimal disks. The\nplanetesimal population closest to the giant planets \u2013 the inner\nseveral AU of the outer planetesimal disk \u2013 is depleted in a few\nMyr as the disk \"viscously\" spreads. Thus, warm dust has a far\nshorter lifetime than in simulations with no seeds. This is reflected in the evolution of the 25\u03bcm flux in Fig. 7, that drops\nbelow the detection threshold after \u223c 45 Myr while the system\nis still stable. In contrast, in the example mixed (Fig. 1) and\nlowmass (Fig. 3) simulations, the 25\u03bcm flux was more than an\norder of magnitude higher after 40-50 Myr of evolution.\nThe shortened lifetime of warm dust is reflected in its changing spectral energy distribution (Fig. 7). Compared with simulations without seeds, there is a much faster decrease in flux at\n\u03bb . 100\u03bcm at early times as the region just exterior to the outermost giant planet is cleared much more efficiently and to a larger\nradial separation. At longer wavelengths the flux also decreases\nmore rapidly due to depletion by scattering from icy embryos,\nalthough at long wavelengths this is counteracted in part by the\nexpansion of the dust disk to larger radii and therefore increased\nsurface area (though lower temperature). There are spikes in the\nflux (seen at 25\u03bcm) when objects enter the inner planetary system to encounter and be ejected by the innermost giant planet.\nThese spikes are due to the fact that each particle represents a\ndistribution of smaller bodies and, with a higher numerical resolution, these spikes would be less pronounced. There is a largescale decrease in flux after the instability and all dust disappears\nwhen the last planetesimal is ejected after \u223c 100 Myr.\nThe giant and terrestrial planet evolution differed only\nslightly between the mixed and seeds simulations. (Recall that\n\nthe giant planets in the seeds simulations are identical to the\nmixed simulations in terms of their total mass and mass distribution.) However, the giant planet instabilities in the seeds\nsimulations appeared slightly weaker. The mean innermost giant\nplanet eccentricity was 0.21 for the seeds simulations compared\nwith 0.27 for the mixed simulations.2 The cause of this difference appears to be late encounters between a giant planet and a\nseed embryo, after the end of giant planet-giant planet scattering.\nTo test this, we sub-divide the 39 unstable bigseed simulations\ninto the 22 simulations in which a giant planet underwent at least\none planet-seed scattering event after the completion of planetplanet encounters and the 17 simulations that did not (i.e., the\nlast planet-planet scattering event in these 17 simulations came\nafter the last planet-seed scattering event). The simulations with\nlate planet-seed encounters had systematically shorter instabilities (as measured by the time between the first and last planetplanet scattering events) and lower final giant planet eccentricities. We think that what happens is that in these systems a planetseed scattering event can lead to a small readjustment in one\ngiant planet's orbit that separates it sufficiently from other giant\nplanets to stabilize the system. However, we note that these samples are relatively small and we cannot rule out that the weaker\nseeds instabilities are a product of small number statistics.\nGiven the weaker giant planet instabilities in the seeds simulations, terrestrial planet formation was correspondingly more\nefficient: only about 1/4 of the unstable seeds simulations destroyed all of their terrestrial material compared with more than\n40% for the unstable mixed simulations. However, the differences between the planetary evolution in the seeds and mixed\nsimulations are small compared with those between some of the\nother sets of simulations such as the lowmass and equal runs.\nDespite their influence on the outer planetesimal disk, seeds\nunderwent little accretion. Among all fifty bigseed simulations,\nno seed accreted more than five planetesimals, and there was\njust a single seed-seed collision and 5 giant planet-seed collisions. There was slightly more accretion among the seeds in\nthe smallseed simulations, which had a comparable rate of\nplanetesimal-seed impacts but a higher rate of giant impacts,\nwith 4 seed-seed collisions and 12 giant planet-seed collisions\namong the fifty simulations, although we note that all but 3 of the\ngiant planet-seed collisions occurred very early and were probably caused by the seed being placed on an orbit that was initially\nvery close to a giant planet.\nFigure 8 shows the correlations between the dust-to-stellar\nflux ratio F/F star (70\u03bcm) after 1 Gyr, and either the innermost giant planet eccentricity or the total terrestrial planet mass. We plot\nresults for the smallseed, bigseed, and mixed simulations.\nThe most important difference between the seeds and mixed\nsimulations is that the seeds simulations produce less dust at\nlate times, especially warm dust that is observable at wave2\nA somewhat higher fraction of the bigseed simulations were unstable compared with the mixed and smallseed simulations. This difference is only moderately statistically significant and might be due in\npart to a small glitch in our initial conditions for the seeds simulations:\nthe inner edge of the outer planetesimal disk was always 4 Hill radii\nexterior to the outermost giant planet but the icy embryos were always\ninitially between 10-20 AU. Thus, in many cases the innermost one to\ntwo seeds were in immediate dynamical contact with the outermost giant planet. This preferentially occurred when the outermost planet was\nvery massive (and hence on a more distant initial orbit) and this glitch\ndoes not appear to have contaminated our results. In fact, the median\ninstability time was later for the bigseed simulations than the mixed\nsimulations, which is the opposite of what would be expected if the instabilities were systematically driven by seed-giant planet interactions.\n\n11\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n0.01 Myr\n\n0.8\n\n1000.000\n\nStart\n5 Myr\n55 Myr\n58 Myr\n100 Myr\n\n0.4\n\n100.000\n\n0.0\n0.8\n\nFlux density, Jy\n\n0.1 Myr\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0.8\n\n1 Myr\n\n0.4\n\nEccentricity\n\n0.0\n0.8\n\n10.000\n1.000\n0.100\n0.010\n\n10 Myr\n\n0.001\n1\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0.8\n\n30 Myr\n\n10\n100\nWavelength \u03bb (\u03bcm)\n\n1000\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0.8\n\n100.0000\n\n55.36 Myr\n\n10.0000\n\n0.0\n0.8\n\nF/Fstar (25 \u03bcm)\n\n0.4\n55.37 Myr\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0.8\n\n200 Myr\n\n0.4\n0.0\n0\n\n0.1000\n0.0100\n0.0010\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nSemimajor Axis (AU)\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\nLog(Water Mass Fraction)\n-5\n\n1.0000\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0.0001\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nTime (Myr)\n\n80\n\n100\n\n-0.3\n\nFig. 7.

Among just the unstable subset of simulations, 53 of 96 mixed simulations (55.2%+4.9%\n\u22125.1%) had\ndust fluxes that would be detectable with Spitzer after 1 Gyr of\nevolution, i.e., with F/F star (70\u03bcm) \u2265 0.55 (Trilling et al. 2008).\nIn comparison, 14 of 29 (48.3%+9%\n\u22128.7% ) unstable smallseed and\n16 of 39 (= 41%+8.1%\n)\nbigseed\nsimulations were detectable at\n\u22127.2%\n70\u03bcm after 1 Gyr. Given the statistical error bars, the decreased\ndetection rate compared with the mixed simulations is only a 1\u03c3\nresult for the smallseed simulations and 2\u03c3 for the bigseed\nsimulations.\nThe effect of the seeds is more apparent when considering the stable simulations. The stable systems remain detectable\nat 98% or higher rate for each of the mixed, smallseed and\nbigseed sets of simulations. However, the actual dust brightness decreases dramatically for simulations with seeds. The median F/F star (70\u03bcm) at 1 Gyr was 26.2 for the stable mixed simulations, 5.3 for smallseed, and 1.7 for bigseed. Given the\n12\n\nscatter, the difference between the mixed and seeds simulations is significant at the 3\u03c3 level and the difference between\nthe bigseed and smallseed is significant at 5\u03c3.\nAt 25\u03bcm the differences are even more striking. In unstable systems, 12/96 (12.5%+4.1%\n\u22122.6% ) mixed simulations, 2/29\n(6.9%+7.8%\n)\nsmallseed\nsimulations,\nand 0/39 (0+4.4% ) bigseed\n\u22122.1%\nsimulations were above the Spitzer detection threshold of\nF/F star (25\u03bcm) \u2265 0.054 after 1 Gyr (Trilling et al. 2008).

Around stars older than 300 Myr the\nfrequency of 24\u03bcm dust excesses was estimated at 2.8%+2.4%\n\u22120.8%\nby Carpenter et al.

Among the 24\u03bcm\ndetections are several systems such as \u03b7 Corvi (Wyatt et al.\n2005) and HD 69830 (Beichman et al. 2005; Bryden et al. 2006)\nthat appear to contain dust at \u223c 1 AU; this dust has been interpreted as either being transient (Wyatt et al. 2007a) or due\nto a very peculiar outcome of planet formation (Wyatt et al.\n2010). Thus, the frequency of systems with 24\u03bcm excess due\nto collisional equilibrium processes is significantly smaller than\nthe quoted values. The frequency of dust excesses at 70\u03bcm is\n16.4%+2.8%\n\u22122.9% (Trilling et al. 2008). This is at least 5-8 times higher\nthan at 24\u03bcm, and the removal of systems with potentially transient dust can only cause this ratio to increase.\nThe mixed simulations produce an overabundance of 25\u03bcm\ndust excesses. After 1 Gyr of evolution, the frequency of de+4.1%\ntectable dust at 25\u03bcm was 91%+2.4%\n\u22125.3% and 12.5%\u22122.6% (1 \u2212 \u03c3 error bars) for stable and unstable systems, respectively. At 70\u03bcm\nthe frequency of detectable dust was 98.2%+0.5%\n\u22123.8% for stable and\n\n55.2%+4.9%\n\u22125.1% for unstable systems. Thus, the ratio of the fraction\nof systems that were detectable after 1 Gyr at 70\u03bcm to 25\u03bcm is\n1.08 for the stable mixed systems and 4.4 for unstable mixed\nsystems. The higher ratio for the unstable systems is a simple\nconsequence of the instability preferentially clearing out the inner portion of outer planetesimal disks and leaving behind the\ncolder part of the disk that does not emit much flux at 25\u03bcm.\nNonetheless, no combination of these ratios for the mixed simulations can match the observed ratio of 5-10 after 1 Gyr of evolution.3\n3\n\nWe note that the unstable mixed systems with detectable 25\u03bcm flux\nare all quite close to the detection limit (Fig. 8), and the fraction of unstable systems that is detectable at 25\u03bcm drops drastically to 2/96 =\n+2.6%\n2.1%\u22120.6%\nafter 3 Gyr of evolution, and the ratio between the detectable\nfrequency at 70\u03bcm to 25\u03bcm increases to 25.5, well within the range\nallowed by observations. However, what is lacking in the mixed simulations is the ability to account for stable systems without 25\u03bcm flux, as\n13\n\n\f1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nmixed\nseeds\n\n0.0\n0.001\n0.010\n0.100\n1.000\nEccentricity of innermost giant planet\n\nFraction with >0.5 MEarth\n\nFraction detectable at 70 \u03bcm (1 Gyr)\n\nRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.01\n\nmixed\nseeds\n\n0.10\n1.00\n10.00\nF/Fstar (70 \u03bcm) at 1 Gyr\n\nFig. 9.

The error bars are based on binomial statistics (see Burgasser et al. 2003). This essentially represents a horizontal slice\nthrough the top left panel of Fig 8. Right: The fraction of systems with 0.5 M\u2295 or more in surviving terrestrial planets as a function\nof F/F star (70\u03bcm) \u2265 0.55 (1 Gyr) for the mixed and seeds simulations. Systems with F/F star < 10\u22122 are included in the bin at\nF/F star \u2248 10\u22122 . The Spitzer detection limit is shown as the dashed line. This represents a vertical slice through the bottom right\npanel of Fig. 8.\nThe seeds simulations may explain the dearth of 25\u03bcm dust\nexcesses because there is a natural suppression of the 25\u03bcm flux\nfor both stable and unstable systems. From the 44 stable and unstable smallseed simulations, only 2 were detectable at 25\u03bcm.\nNone of the bigseed simulations were detectable at 25\u03bcm. The\nreason for the lack of 25\u03bcm flux is that the viscous-like spreading out of the outer planetesimal disk acts to both deplete the\ninner part of the disk by inward scattering and to push the outer\npart of the disk to ever colder temperatures. The net effect is the\nnear complete frustration of the 25\u03bcm flux. However, the detection rates at 70\u03bcm are higher than 50% for both the smallseed\nand bigseed simulations, including both the stable and unstable\nsystems. Thus, the existence of \u223c Earth-mass seeds in outer planetesimal disks may provide a natural explanation for the very low\nfrequency of 25\u03bcm excesses compared with 70\u03bcm excesses.\nAs seen in Fig. 8, the anti-correlation between giant planet\neccentricity eg and debris disks still holds for the seeds simulations. For eccentricities larger than 0.1, the dust fluxes show\na rapid decrease for the sets of simulations with and without\nseeds because the dynamics of unstable giant planets dominates\nthe survival of planetesimals. However, for smaller eccentricities there is a clear segregation: the bigseed systems have\nthe smallest dust fluxes, the mixed systems have the largest,\nand the smallseed are in the middle. In this realm the stirring\nup of outer planetesimal disks dominates the dust flux, and as\nwe've seen before the seeds simulations create a lower-mass\nand colder planetesimal disk than the mixed systems, leading to\nlower dust fluxes in proportion to the seeds' mass (not number).\nIn fact, many of the unstable bigseed systems with modestly\neccentric giant planets (eg \u223c 0.1) have dust fluxes as high as\nthe stable systems. However, despite their differences, Figure 9\n\nthe fraction of stable systems with detectable 25\u03bcm flux remains very\n+3.7%\nhigh, at 83.9%\u22126.0%\n.\n14\n\nshows that the fraction of systems that is detectable at 70\u03bcm as a\nfunction of eg is very similar for the seeds and mixed systems.\nThe debris disk-terrestrial planet correlation still holds for\nthe seeds simulations. As with the eg , the correlation between\nthe dust flux at 70\u03bcm after 1 Gyr and the total surviving terrestrial planet mass is less evident because stable seeds systems\nthat efficiently form terrestrial planets produce far less dust than\ntheir mixed counterparts. Again, for the stable systems there is\na clear segregation between the sets of simulations, with the\nlargest seed mass bigseed having the smallest flux. However,\nFig. 9 shows that the fraction of systems that form at least 0.5 M\u2295\nin terrestrial planets increases for both the seeds and mixed\nsimulations. However, the seeds curve is 1 \u2212 2\u03c3 higher than\nthe mixed curve close to the detection limit. This reflects the fact\nthat the seeds simulations deplete their outer planetesimal disks\nfar more than the mixed simulations: only very calm systems\npreserve enough planetesimals to produce dust. The systems that\nare observed at a given dust flux therefore represent more stable\nsystems for the seeds simulations than the mixed ones. Thus,\nthe seeds simulations predict an even stronger correlation between stars with observed debris disks and yet-to-be-discovered\nterrestrial planets.\n4.2. The width of the outer planetesimal disk (the widedisk\nsimulations)\n\nThe widedisk simulations allow us to test the effects of a\nhigher-mass, wider outer planetesimal disk. Compared with the\nmixed simulations, the outer planetesimal disk in the widedisk\nsimulations was twice as wide, 20 AU rather than 10 AU, and\ncontained twice the total mass in planetesimals, 100 M\u2295 instead\nof 50 M\u2295. The inner 10 AU of the outer planetesimal disk is\ntherefore the same for the widedisk and mixed simulations (although the numerical resolution is halved in the widedisk runs)\nbut the widedisk systems contain an additional 10 AU of plan-\n\n\fF/Fstar (70 \u03bcm) at 1 Gyr\n\n100.00\n\n10.00\n\n1.00\nstable\nunstable\n\n0.10\n\nmixed\nwidedisk\n\n0.01\n0.001\n0.010\n0.100\n1.000\nEccentricity of innermost giant planet\n\nFraction detectable at 70 \u03bcm (1 Gyr)\n\nRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nmixed\nwidedisk\n\n0.0\n0.001\n0.010\n0.100\n1.000\nEccentricity of innermost giant planet\n\nFig. 11.

Orbital evolution of a widedisk simulation that underwent a Nice model-like instability. The evolution of the semimajor axes, perihelion and aphelion distances of the three giant planets are shown in black, and the semimajor axes of the\n19 surviving outer planetesimals in grey (note that one additional planetesimal survived with a = 59 AU). Two terrestrial\nplanets formed in this system, at 0.71 AU (1.4 M\u2295)and 1.76 AU\n(0.13 M\u2295): accretion was perturbed by the perturbations moderately eccentric inner giant planets at 4.7 AU (0.78M J , e oscillates\nbetween 0.03 and 0.17) and 7.8 AU (2.4M J , e oscillates between\n0.06 and 0.1).\netesimals. In addition, the outer boundary of each simulation \u2013\nthe limit beyond which particles are considered to be ejected \u2013\nwas 1000 AU rather than 100 AU.\nThe widedisk simulations behaved similarly to the mixed\nsimulations in most respects. However, the more massive outer\nplanetesimal disk did cause a few notable differences between\nthe widedisk and mixed simulations. Given the much larger\n\nangular momentum reservoir contained in the outer planetesimal\ndisk, \u223cSaturn-mass giant planets on eccentric orbits can be captured in the outer system by planetesimal scattering. Figure 10\nshows the evolution of one such system, in which the two inner\nplanets (Minner = 0.78M J , Mouter = 2.4M J ) started just interior to\nthe 2:1 mean motion resonance. The giant planets' clearing out\nof the inner portion of the outer planetesimal disk drove the two\ninner giant planets across the 2:1 MMR after \u223c 0.1 Myr. This\ncaused a perturbative increase in their eccentricities and a corresponding increase in the eccentricity of the outer, Saturn-mass\nplanet. The outer planet's semimajor axis increased quickly and\nover the next 10 Myr its eccentricity slowly decreased by secular\nfriction with the outer disk of planetesimals. Despite the perturbative evolution of the system, 19 planetesimals totaling 1.9 M\u2295\nsurvived in the outer planetesimal disk (their orbital evolution is\nshown in grey in Fig. 10). Most of these started the simulation\nin the outer parts of the planetesimal disk (one at 18 AU). As\nthe outer giant planet migrated outward, it shepherded many of\nthese planetesimals in its 3:2, 2:1, and even its 3:1 mean motion\nresonances, located at 30.8, 37.2 and 48.9 AU at the end of the\nsimulation, respectively. This is analogous to the shepherding of\nKuiper belt objects such as Pluto during Neptune's planetesimaldriven migration (Levison et al. 2008). The surviving planetesimal disk in the simulation from Fig. 10 is massive enough to\nremain detectable at 70\u03bcm for 3 Gyr but is cold enough not to\nbe detectable at shorter wavelengths. Planetesimal-driven migration of a massive planet therefore represents another mechanism\n\u2013 in addition to the presence of seeds in outer planetesimal disks\n\u2013 to deplete outer planetesimal disks and to push them outward\nto colder temperatures. However, this mechanism operated efficiently in only a small fraction of widedisk simulations.\nDespite having identical giant planet initial conditions, a significantly smaller fraction of widedisk simulations went unstable compared with the mixed simulations (40.7%+5.2%\n\u22124.9% for\nwidedisk vs. 63.2%+3.6%\nfor\nmixed).\nThis\nis\nbecause\nof the\n\u22124.1%\nlarger angular momentum reservoir in the outer planetesimal\ndisks.

Right: Histogram of the fraction of systems that contain 0.5 M\u2295 or more in terrestrial planets as a function of\nF/F star (70\u03bcm) after 1 Gyr; this is essentially a vertical slice through the left panel.\ntric the disk's ability to transfer orbital angular momentum (as\nwell as energy) to damp the outer planet's eccentricity and also\nto increase its semimajor axis increases for a more massive planetesimal disk. Thus, if all systems of giant planets formed on orbits that would be unstable in the absence of planetesimal disks,\ntheir long-term orbital evolution should vary with the outer disk\nmass. The distribution of outer disk masses may therefore play a\ncritical role in shaping the dynamics of inner planetary systems.\nFigure 11 compares the debris disk - giant planet eccentricity\nanti-correlation for the widedisk and mixed simulations. Both\ndistributions follow the same shape as the other sets of simulations: at eg . 0.05 the vast majority of systems were dynamically\nstable and therefore have high fluxes, and for eg & 0.05 unstable\nsystems dominate and the probability of having a significant dust\nflux decreases strongly with increasing eg . For stable systems,\nthe 70\u03bcm fluxes are generally 2-3 times larger for the widedisk\nsystems because their outer planetesimal disks are more massive and the dust flux is dominated by the outer regions of the\ndisk where the collisional evolution is slow. However, the ratio\nof the median F/F star (70\u03bcm) after 1 Gyr for the widedisk to\nthe mixed simulations was 2.7, but at 25\u03bcm the value was only\n1.6. This shows that in the inner regions of the outer planetesimal disk, where collisional evolution is faster, the higher-mass\nwidedisk disks approach the dust production level of the lowermass mixed disks.\nThe distribution of fluxes for the unstable systems is the\nsame for the widedisk and mixed systems, meaning that the\nrate of survival of planetesimal disks is dominated by the giant\nplanet dynamics rather than the initial conditions, even the total\nmass and radial extent. For these unstable systems, the distributions of instability times for the mixed and widedisk simulations were indistinguishable. The distribution of the fraction\nof systems that is detectable with Spitzer is almost identical for\nthe two sets of simulations: in both cases there is a plateau at\n\u223c 100% for eg . 0.05 and a sharp decrease toward higher eccentricities.\nFigure 12 compares the debris disk - terrestrial planet correlation for the widedisk and mixed simulations. Again, the two\n16\n\ndistributions have the same shape but the dust fluxes for the stable systems (i.e., for those with the highest surviving terrestrial\nplanet mass) are 2-3 times higher for the widedisk systems. The\ndistributions are almost indistinguishable for systems with less\nthan about 2 M\u2295 in surviving terrestrial planets. For both sets\nof simulations the fraction of systems with 0.5 M\u2295 or more in\nterrestrial planets increases monotonically with F/F star (70\u03bcm)\nat 1 Gyr. However, above the detection limit a slightly higher\nfraction of mixed systems contain terrestrial planets compared\nwith widedisk. This is the opposite of the effect that we saw\nin section 4.1 for the seeds systems. The widedisk systems\nform very bright dust disks and require somewhat stronger giant planet perturbations to decrease the flux below the detection\nlimit. Thus, systems with bright debris disks at 70\u03bcm are less\nsensitive to the presence of terrestrial planets than the mixed\nsystems. Note that this difference comes from the slightly higher\nfraction of widedisk systems with eccentric giant planets that\nproduce 70\u03bcm excesses (see Fig. 11)\n\n5. Effect of the gas disk during instabilities (the gas\nsimulations)\nIn the gas set of simulations we added additional forces to the\nMercury integrator (Chambers 1999) that acted on planetesimal and embryo particles to mimic the effects of the dissipating gaseous protoplanetary disk from which the planets formed.\nIn these simulations we included two effects: 1) aerodynamic\ngas drag due to the headwind felt by bodies orbiting at the\nKeplerian speed while gas orbits slower due to pressure support. Aerodynamic drag acts most strongly on small objects, i.e.\nplanetesimals, and leads to a rapid decay in eccentricity and inclination as well as a slower decay of the semimajor axis; and\n2) tidal damping (also called \"type 1 damping\") due to gravitational interactions between objects and the disk. Type 1 damping\nincreases for more massive bodies because it is caused by waves\nexcited in the disk, meaning that this was an important source of\ndissipation for embryos but not for planetesimals. Aerodynamic\ndrag was calculated using standard models (Adachi et al. 1976)\n\n\fassuming planetesimals to be spheres with radii of 10 km. Type 1\ndamping was included based on linear calculations for planets\nembedded within isothermal disks (Tanaka & Ward 2004). We\nincluded additional terms for large eccentricities and inclinations that were derived by Cresswell & Nelson (2008). We included type 1 damping but not type 1 migration both to maintain\na clearer comparison with the simulations without gas forces and\nbecause eccentricity damping from the disk is roughly 2 orders\nof magnitude faster than radial migration (Tanaka & Ward 2004;\nCresswell & Nelson 2008).\nWe assumed the presence of an underlying gas disk\nthat corresponds to roughly half the minimum-mass solar nebula (Weidenschilling 1977; Hayashi 1981), with surface density profile \u03a3(r) = 875 (r/1AU)\u22123/2 g cm\u22122 and\nvertical density distribution \u03c1(z) = exp(z2 /z20 ), where\nz0 (r) = 0.0472 (r/1AU)5/4 AU (see also Thommes et al. 2003;\nRaymond et al. 2006a; Mandell et al. 2007). We note that the\ndistribution of solid mass in our initial conditions is distributed\naccording to a different density profile, \u03a3 \u221d r\u22121 , in both the terrestrial and outer planetesimal zones. We used a steeper radial\nsurface density profile for the gas in order to increase the gas\ndensity in the inner disk to maximize the effect of gas drag on\nthe survival of terrestrial bodies. However, we note that our initial conditions for the inner and outer disks \u2013 which were chosen\nas represent approximate guesses for the Solar System's primordial disk \u2013 do not even follow the same global surface density\nprofile because there is far too little mass in the terrestrial zone.\nThe solution to this problem may lie with variations in the efficiency of planetesimal formation at different orbital radii within\nprotoplanetary disks (e.g. Chambers 2010).\nTo model the final stage in the lifetime of the gaseous\ndisk, the disk's surface density was dissipated linearly and\nuniformly in 500,000 years. This is slightly longer than\nmost estimates of the final dissipation phase (Simon & Prato\n1995; Wolk & Walter 1996; Chiang & Murray-Clay 2007;\nCurrie et al. 2009) and should thus maximize the importance of the gas disk phase. This situation is roughly consistent with models for dynamical instabilities among planets in the presence of gas disks (Chatterjee et al. 2008;\nMoeckel et al. 2008; Matsumura et al. 2010; Marzari et al. 2010;\nMoeckel & Armitage 2012), which predict that instabilities\nshould preferentially occur late in the disk phase. The powerlaw gas density profile probably overestimates the amount of gas\ninterior to the giant planets (Crida & Morbidelli 2007), so these\nsimulations should provide an upper limit to the effects of gas on\nterrestrial bodies. The initial conditions for the gas simulations\nwere drawn directly from the mixed set of simulations with one\nimportant change: the middle giant planet's eccentricity was increased to make its orbit cross the orbit of the innermost planet.\nThis was to ensure that the system would be immediately unstable so that we could test the effects of the relatively short-lived\ngaseous disk.\nThe goal of the gas simulations is to test the effect of damping from the gas disk on the dynamics and survival of rocky and\nicy bodies in the inner and outer planetary system. To accomplish this, we want the giant planet instabilities to be the same as\nfor the mixed set, to isolate the effects of the disk. Thus, we neglected type 1 and type 2 radial migration of giant planets (and\nembryos) in the gas simulations, although they would certainly\noccur in a realistic minimum-mass disk (e.g., Lin & Papaloizou\n1986; Ward 1997). Indeed, in a more self-consistent setting the\ngiant planets would likely be trapped in resonance at early times\nand the instability would be triggered by either eccentricity\nexcitation (Marzari et al. 2010; Libert & Tsiganis 2011) or the\n\nTotal terrestrial planet mass (MEarth)\n\nRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\n4\ngas\nmixed\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nMinimum giant planet orbital distance (AU)\n\nFig. 13.

The median eccentricity\nof the surviving giant planets in the gas simulations is slightly\nhigher \u2013 0.26 vs. 0.22. The reason for the stronger instabilities in\nthe gas simulations is that they were initially placed on strongly\nunstable, crossing orbits and thus were unable to undergo weaker\ninstabilities that can occur when they develop more slowly (and\nrecall that no damping was felt by the giant planets in the gas\nsimulations). The gas giants provided a comparable fit to the\nexoplanet distribution (p value from K-S test of 0.67 for gas,\n0.49 for mixed). A notable difference between the distributions\nis a population of low-eccentricity (e . 0.05) giant planets that\nis significantly more abundant in the unstable mixed than the\ngas simulations. This population was generated by weakly unstable systems and these systems are the most efficient at both\nforming terrestrial planets and producing debris disks. Although\nthe instabilities in the gas simulations occurred very early by\ndesign, the distributions of the duration of instabilities were virtually identical for the gas and unstable mixed simulations, extending from 104 to 107 years with a median of slightly more\nthan 300,000 years. This is due in part to the fact that we have\nnot included appropriate drag forces acting on the giant planets\nas these are difficult to estimate without hydrodynamical simulations (see e.g., Moeckel et al. 2008; Marzari et al. 2010).\nThe effect of the giant planets on terrestrial planet formation\nwas similar for the gas and mixed simulations. Figure 13 shows\nthat the sculpting of the terrestrial zone by the giant planets \u2013 as\nmeasured by the minimum giant planet perihelion distance during the simulation \u2013 is the same for the unstable mixed and the\ngas simulations. The only slight difference comes from two gas\nsimulations in which a giant planet came closer than 1 AU to\nthe star (in one case for a prolonged period of almost 1 Myr) but\nthat succeeded in forming a terrestrial planet. In both of these\ncases the surviving planet was roughly a Mars mass (although\nin one case the planet accreted another embryo) and underwent\n17\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\n0.4\n\n1.0\nmixed\ngas\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4+\nNumber of terrestrial planets (>0.05 MEarth)\n\nFig. 14.

The survival of these planets may be due in part to gas drag from the\ndisk, although they may simply represent a tail of the mixed distribution.\nFigure 14 shows that the distributions of the number of surviving terrestrial planets in the gas and the unstable mixed systems are very close (1\u03c3 is 5-8% for most bins as calculated using binomial statistics; see Burgasser et al. 2003). The gas and\nunstable mixed simulations each formed a mean of 1.2 planets\nplanets per unstable system, although there is a slight tendency\nfor more zero- and one-planet systems in the gas simulations.\nWe attribute this to the fact that in the gas simulations the giant planets started on orbits that were already strongly unstable\nand the instability involved the innermost giant planet with the\nstrongest influence on the terrestrial planet zone. Thus, outwarddirected instabilities and weakly unstable systems were less frequent in the gas simulations.\nAlthough the number of surviving planets was similar, the\nsurviving terrestrial planets in the unstable mixed simulations\nwere significantly more massive than in the gas simulations.\nThe median terrestrial planet mass was 0.43 M\u2295 for gas and\n0.73 M\u2295 for mixed (counting only simulations that were integrated for >100 Myr and planets > 0.1 M\u2295 ). In addition, 28 of\nthe 90 unstable mixed terrestrial planets were more than 1 M\u2295\n+7.9%\n(31.1%+5.2%\n\u22124.4%) compared with 4 of 33 (12.1%\u22123.5%) for the gas\nterrestrial planets. The larger masses of the unstable mixed simulations come from the contribution from weakly unstable systems, i.e. those with minimum giant planet perihelion distances\nlarger than about 4 AU in Fig. 13. For systems where a giant\nplanet entered within 4 AU of the star, the two sets had the same\nmedian terrestrial planet mass.\nA small fraction of unstable systems produced asteroid belts\nwithout terrestrial planets. In these systems a number of rocky\nplanetesimals were the only survivors in the inner planetary system, as all terrestrial embryos had been destroyed. This occurred\nin 14 of 299 (4.7 \u00b1 1.2%) of unstable simulations across all the\nsets of simulations (excluding the lowmass simulations). The\ngas simulations had a slightly higher rate of production of asteroid belt-only systems (3/45 = 6.7%+5.7%\n\u22122.0% ), presumably because in a few cases gas drag was able to stabilize the orbits\n18\n\nFraction with >0.5 MEarth\n\nFraction of Systems\n\n0.5\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.01\n\nmixed\ngas\n\n0.10\n1.00\n10.00\nF/Fstar (70 \u03bcm) at 1 Gyr\n\nFig. 15.

These asteroid\nbelts are low-mass, containing only 1-20 asteroid particles (each\n5 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2295 ), albeit typically on excited orbits with moderate\neccentricities (e \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.3) and inclinations (i \u223c 20 \u2212 30\u25e6 ).\nGiven their rapid collisional evolution, these belts probably become quickly dominate by a few relatively large objects and are\nprobably not detectable with current instruments.\nThe surviving terrestrial planets in the gas and the unstable\nmixed simulations had similar median eccentricities e and inclinations i (median values of e \u2248 0.1 and i \u2248 5 \u2212 6\u25e6 ). However,\nthe gas simulations tend to have significantly higher oscillation\namplitudes in e and i. Although the median oscillation amplitudes are relatively close (median peak-to-peak eosc = 0.13 and\niosc = 7\u25e6 for gas vs. 0.10 and 5\u25e6 for mixed), planets in the gas\nsimulations are shifted to higher values. Again, this difference\nis simply due to the lack of weakly unstable systems in the gas\nsimulations; when a cut in the minimum giant planet perihelion\nof <4 AU is applied the oscillation amplitudes are a match.\nThe anti-correlation between the giant planet eccentricity\nand the dust flux at 70\u03bcm is very similar between the gas and unstable mixed simulations. The positive correlation between the\nmass in surviving terrestrial planets and dust flux is also preserved in the gas simulations. Figure 15 shows the fraction of\nsystems that formed at least 0.5 M\u2295 in terrestrial planets as a\nfunction of F/F star (70\u03bcm) at 1 Gyr. The two distributions are almost identical. The only slight divergence is at small F/F star values, where the mixed simulations are about 1\u03c3 higher than the\ngas simulations. This is explained by the fact that the gas simulations are inward-directed by design, because the instability is\ntriggered by a close encounter between the inner two giant planets (simply because our initial conditions put the middle giant\nplanet on an orbit that crosses the inner one's). In contrast, the\nmixed instabilities include both inward- and outward-directed\ninstabilities, i.e., instabilities that can be triggered in, and largely\nconfined to, either the inner or outer parts of the system. Inwarddirected instabilities that perturb the outer planetesimal disk\nare necessarily very strong, somewhat stronger than equivalent\noutward-directed instabilities that perturb the outer disk. This\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\nonly appears to be important (and then only at 1\u03c3) for the lowest values of F/F star , where the disk is most strongly depleted\n(note that the lowest bin includes systems with F/F star < 0.01).\nThus, the presence of disk gas at the time of giant planet instabilities does not appear to have a significant effect on the debris\ndisk-terrestrial planet correlation.\nWe conclude that there are no strong systematic differences\nbetween the gas and the unstable mixed sets of simulations.\n\n6. Implications of dynamically active giant planets\nWe now explore the implications of our results for expected correlations between extra-solar terrestrial planets, giant planets and\ndebris disks. We emphasize that our conclusions are of course\ndetermined in part by our chosen initial conditions, which are\npoorly-constrained observationally. Several aspects of the initial\nconditions have considerable uncertainties: 1) the mass and mass\ndistribution in the terrestrial planet zone, 2) the mass, mass distribution and extent of the outer planetesimal disk, 3) the number, masses and initial spacing of the giant planets, and 4) the\nrelative masses and spacing of these three components. We have\nchosen what we consider to be reasonable values of the different\ncomponents, but these values certainly vary from system to system and cover a far wider range than the subset included here.\nIn addition, some systems with qualitatively different properties\nprobably exist, such as disks with very widely-spaced giant planets or in which planetesimals only form in narrow regions. We\ndiscuss the impact of these assumptions on our results in section\n6.4 below.\nWith these limitations in mind, we now perform a simple experiment based on the results of our simulations. The goal of the\nexperiment is to use the giant planets to match the observed exoplanet mass and eccentricity distributions and to then test different correlations within that framework. We construct two samples of systems that provide an adequate match to observations\nusing simple, non-fine-tuned mixes of different sets of simulations. We then explore the implications of those samples.\n6.1. Observational constraints\n\nAny sample we construct is constrained by observations of giant\nexoplanets, debris disks, and correlations between those two. We\nnow summarize these key characteristics.\nFirst, we are constrained by the distribution of known giant exoplanets, particularly those beyond 0.2 AU that have presumably not been affected by tidal interactions with their host\nstars. The mass distribution can be fit with a simple power law:\ndN/dM \u223c M \u22121.1 (Butler et al. 2006; Udry & Santos 2007). This\nis the mass distribution of the entire sample. It is likely similar\nto the ensemble-averaged mass distribution of planets prior to\nscattering (with some modification due to mass-dependent planetary ejections and collisions with the star) but, as discussed\nbelow, it need not be the mass distribution prior to scattering in any individual system (i.e. on a system-by-system level,\nplanet masses may be correlated). The frequency of giant planets is very low (< 1%) close-in, but increases sharply at 0.51 AU and appears to remain at a high level out to at least 3\nAU (Cumming et al. 2008; Mayor et al. 2011). The median giant\nexoplanet eccentricity is \u223c 0.25 and the distribution extends to\nabove 0.9 (Butler et al. 2006; Udry & Santos 2007). The eccentricity distribution is independent of orbital distance (for planets not affected by tides Ford & Rasio 2008). In addition, observations show that more massive giant planets (M p & M J )\n\nhave higher eccentricities than lower-mass giants (M p . M J ;\nJones et al. 2006; Ribas & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2007; Ford & Rasio\n2008; Wright et al. 2009).\nSecond, we are constrained by debris disk statistics, and\nwe focus on observations at 70\u03bcm made primarily with Spitzer.\nObservations show that 16.4%+2.8\n\u22122.9 % of solar-type stars have detectable dust emission at 70\u03bcm (Trilling et al. 2008). There is no\nobserved variation in this fraction with age, although the upper\nenvelope of actual fluxes decreases for stars older than 1 Gyr or\nso (Hillenbrand et al. 2008; Carpenter et al. 2009).\nFinally, we are constrained by any connection that might exist between the presence of giant exoplanets and debris disks.\nDebris disks have been detected around more than 20 stars\nwith known exoplanets. However, there is currently no correlation between the presence of planets and debris disks:\nthe incidence of debris disks is about 15% for both stars\nwith and without planets (see Table 1 in K\u00f3sp\u00e1l et al. 2009;\nMoro-Mart\u0131\u0301n et al. 2007; Bryden et al. 2009). We also note\nthat the strong observed correlation between the fraction of\nstars with currently-known exoplanets (hot Jupiters in particular) and the stellar metallicity (Gonzalez 1997; Santos et al.\n2001; Fischer & Valenti 2005) is not apparent in the sample of\nknown debris disks (Beichman et al. 2006; Greaves et al. 2006;\nBryden et al. 2006; K\u00f3sp\u00e1l et al. 2009).\n6.2. Consistency with known giant planet properties\n\nThe masses of individual giant planets, as well as the mass\nratio between planets in a given system, are the most important factor governing the outcome of planet-planet scattering (Raymond et al. 2010). Equal-mass giant planets provide the strongest instabilities for a given mass, and the most\neccentric surviving planets (Ford et al. 2003; Raymond et al.\n2010). Scattered equal-mass planets are also more widelyspaced than planets with mass ratios of a few (Raymond et al.\n2009a, 2010). And among equal-mass unstable systems, more\nmassive planets yield larger eccentricities but smaller inclinations (Raymond et al. 2010). The dynamics of scattering is only\nweakly dependent on the planet masses; Neptune-mass planets at\na few AU require far more close encounters to eject one another\nthan Jupiter-mass planets but their final orbital distributions are\nsimilar. The number of giant planets also plays a role; in general,\nmore giant planets lead to more scattering events and higher final\neccentricities (Juri\u0107 & Tremaine 2008).\nWe construct two mixtures of our simulations to reproduce\nthe observations:\n\u2013 Case A is based on the mixed simulations. The eccentricity distribution of surviving giant planets in the simulations\n(considering just the innermost planet as it provides the closest match to radial velocity observations) provides a quantitative match to the observed distribution with a probability value p of 0.49 calculated from a K-S test. The best\nmatch is found by including only unstable systems, but the\np value is still an acceptable 5-25% if the giant planet sample includes a 5-10% contribution from stable systems, with\na higher p for smaller contributions of stable systems (see\nFig. 19 in Paper 1). Case A includes a 10% contribution from\nstable systems. Note that, since case A is built on the mixed\nsimulations and that several other sets of simulations share\nthe same giant planet characteristics (smallseed, bigseed,\nwidedisk, and gas), variations on Case A can be constructed by substituting a different set of simulations for the\nmixed set.\n19\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\nCase B\n\nF/Fstar (70 \u03bcm) at 1 Gyr\n\nCase A\n100.00\n\n100.00\n\n10.00\n\n10.00\n\n1.00\n\n1.00\n\n0.10\n\n0.10\nunstable\nstable\n\n0.01\n0.001\n\nequal\nlowmass\n\n0.010\n\n0.100\n\n1.000\n\n0.01\n0.001\n\n0.010\n\n0.100\n\n1.000\n\nEccentricity of innermost giant planet\nFig. 16. The dust-to-stellar flux ratio at 70\u03bcm after 1 Gyr of evolution as a function of the eccentricity of the innermost giant planet\neg,in for cases A and B. Systems in which the innermost giant planet is exterior to 8 AU have been excluded from this plot.\n\u2013 Case B is constructed from a combination of the equal and\nlowmass simulations. The simplest scenario to explain the\nobservation that higher-mass planets have higher eccentricities is for massive planets to form in systems with multiple,\nroughly equal-mass planets (see section 5 of Raymond et al.\n2010). At low planet masses the eccentricities are larger than\nobserved, so to balance the sample a contribution of systems\nwith lower-mass (M \u2264 MS at \u2212 M Jup ) planets with significant mass ratios is needed \u2013 these are represented with our\nlowmass set. The exact number of low-mass systems needed\nis poorly constrained. In practice, we divide the lowmass\nin two based on the mass of the innermost surviving giant\nplanet (dividing at 50 M\u2295 ); case B includes an equal number of systems at M \u2264 M Jup from the equal and unstable\nlowmass simulations.\nCases A and B each provide a marginally acceptable match\nto the observed exoplanet eccentricity distribution. Case A\nmatches the giant exoplanet distribution with p = 0.08 from K-S\ntests, and if we allow a 5-10% increase in the number of planets\nwith e = 0 (as suggested by Zakamska et al. 2010) Case B also\nmatches the distribution, with p \u2248 0.1. Given the uncertainties in\norbital fitting of exoplanet eccentricities (Shen & Turner 2008;\nZakamska et al. 2010) we do not attempt to fine-tune our samples to better fit the observations. Case A naturally matches the\nobserved mass distribution (except for a bias due to the mass dependence of ejected planets) and as the outcomes for the equal\nsimulations were mostly mass-independent, weighting of different outcomes with the equal contribution is not necessary, and\ncase B can be also considered to provide a match to the mass\ndistribution (see section 5 in Raymond et al. 2010, for more details). However, the two cases have different implications for\nthe nature of planetary systems. In case A, all planetary systems experience the same qualitative evolution because nearly\nall of them become dynamically unstable. In case B, the evolution of systems is divided according to the planetary masses:\nhigh-mass planetary systems undergo extremely violent instabilities, but the evolution of lower-mass systems is much calmer\nand many such systems are dynamically stable. Current observa20\n\ntions favor case B over case A because it reproduces the higher\neccentricities of more massive planets (Ribas & Miralda-Escud\u00e9\n2007; Wright et al. 2009) while for case A higher-mass planets\nhave lower eccentricities than low-mass planets (Raymond et al.\n2010).\n6.3. Debris disk correlations in cases A and B\n\nThe expected trends \u2013 an anti-correlation between giant planet\neccentricity and debris disks and a positive correlation between\nterrestrial planets and debris disks \u2013 are clearly seen in both the\ncase A and B systems.\nFigure 16 shows the dust flux at 70\u03bcm after 1 Gyr vs. the\ninnermost giant planet's eccentricity for all the simulations in\neach case without the weighting described above (e.g., Case B\nstill only contains the unstable lowmass simulations with inner planet masses greater than 50 M\u2295 but there is no weighting between the equal and lowmass components). The anticorrelation is clear in the case A simulations but the large intrinsic scatter in the lowmass component of case B makes the trend\nless evident for case B. The scatter is caused by the fact that the\ncase B simulations are susceptible to planetesimal-driven radial\nmigration that allows for a wide range in the depletion of the\nouter planetesimal disk depending on the outer planet's orbital\nhistory.\nThe correlation between eg and F/F star (70\u03bcm) is clearer\nwhen the data are binned. Figure 17 (left panel) shows that cases\nA and B are very similar in terms of the fraction of systems that\nis detectable at 70\u03bcm as a function of eg : both cases show the expected clear anti-correlation between debris disks and eccentric\ngiant planets including a rapid decrease in the detectable fraction\nfor eg > 0.03 \u2212 0.1. When considering the fraction of systems\nwith eg > 0.1 as a function of F/F star (70\u03bcm) (right panel of\nFig. 17) there is an offset of roughly 1 \u2212 \u03c3 between the two cases\nthat is again due to the larger inherent scatter in the case B simulations, in particular the high-mass, unstable component of the\nlowmass simulations.\n\n\f1.0\n\n1.0\nFraction with eg > 0.1\n\nFraction detectable at 70 \u03bcm (1 Gyr)\n\nRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\nCase A\nCase B\n\n0.0\n0.001\n0.010\n0.100\n1.000\nEccentricity of innermost giant planet\n\nCase A\nCase B\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.01\n\n0.10\n1.00\n10.00\nF/Fstar (70 \u03bcm) at 1 Gyr\n\nFig. 17.

The dust-to-stellar flux ratio at 70\u03bcm after 1 Gyr of evolution as a function of the total mass in surviving terrestrial planets\nfor cases A and B. Again, the Solar System is represented by the grey star.\nWe now turn to the debris disk - terrestrial planet correlation shown in Paper 1. This correlation arises naturally\nfrom the destructive role of dynamically active giant planets\nfor both terrestrial planet formation and the survival of outer\nplanetesimal disks. Indeed, the giant planets' role in terrestrial\nplanet formation is almost purely antagonistic: giant planets\nmay quench or stifle terrestrial planet formation but have not\nbeen shown to help it along in any significant way (see Paper 1\nand also Chambers & Cassen 2002; Levison & Agnor 2003;\nRaymond et al. 2004; Raymond 2006; Raymond et al. 2006a,\n\n2009c), except in some circumstances to promote runaway\ngrowth of planetesimals (Kortenkamp et al. 2001). Nonetheless,\nif we assume that giant planets generally form outside the snow\nline, moderately high eccentricities are needed before the impact\non terrestrial planet formation becomes deleterious.\nFigure 18 shows the terrestrial planet-debris disk correlation for cases A and B. As before, the correlation between\nF/F star (70\u03bcm) after 1 Gyr and the total mass in surviving terrestrial planets is clearer for case A. Again, this comes from the\n21\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\nlow mass simulations' much larger scatter in F/F star and somewhat lower typical values for F/F star .\nWhen the data are binned, the terrestrial planet-debris disk\ncorrelation is clearer for both cases. Figure 19 (left panel) shows\nthe fraction of systems with F/F star (70\u03bcm) above the Spitzer detection limit as a function of the total terrestrial planet mass (i.e.,\na horizontal slice through Fig. 18). The correlations are similar\nfor cases A and B, with only small differences for small terrestrial planet masses, for which a higher fraction of systems remains detectable for case A. We attribute this difference to the\nmore dynamic evolution of case B systems, which deplete or destroy their outer planetesimal disks at a much higher rate than\ncase A systems. Cases A and B follow nearly identical trends\nin terms of the fraction of systems with at least 0.5 M\u2295 in terrestrial planets as a function of F/F star (70\u03bcm) (i.e., a vertical\nslice through Fig. 18). The only modest discrepancy that at very\nlow fluxes (F/F star (70\u03bcm) . 0.05) there are more case A systems with terrestrial planets. Once again, we attribute this to the\nmore dynamic evolution of case B systems: the typical case B\nsystem that destroys its outer planetesimal disk is more likely to\nalso destroy its inner rocky material than a corresponding case\nA system because in this regime case B is dominated by the very\nviolently unstable equal systems.\nTo summarize, we conclude from Figs 16-18 that the debris\ndisk - eccentric giant planet anti-correlation and the debris disk\n- terrestrial planet correlation are clear in both cases A and B.\n6.4. Discussion\n\nCould our two predicted correlations be artifacts of our initial\nconditions? Is there any reasonable scenario that could remove\nthese correlations?\nThe debris disk - eccentric giant planet anti-correlation exists because giant planet instabilities tend to clear out outer planetesimal disks, mainly by dynamical ejection. For eccentric giant planets not to be anti-correlated with debris disks, something fundamental about our proposed scenario must change.\nTo start with, other mechanisms have been proposed to explain\nthe large eccentricities of the observed exoplanets (for an exhaustive list, see Section 1 of Ford & Rasio 2008). However,\nto date the planet-planet scattering model is the only mechanism that has been shown to be physically viable and to fully\nreproduce the currently-observed characteristics of the giant exoplanet population (Ford & Rasio 2008; Chatterjee et al. 2008;\nJuri\u0107 & Tremaine 2008; Raymond et al. 2010).\nThe initial conditions of our simulations certainly play a role\nin producing the correlations we find; for example, if there exist\nwide radial gaps between the giant planets and outer planetesimal disks then the giant planets' influence on debris disks would\nbe weaker. The giant planets would appear to be basically irrelevant for the existence of debris disks. However, even a distant\ngiant planet has a destructive influence on a planetesimal disk by\nincreasing eccentricities sufficiently that inter-particle collisions\nbecome destructive (Mustill & Wyatt 2009). A simple fit to the\nobserved distribution of debris disks using a self-stirred model\nlike the one presented in section 2 shows that outer planetesimal disks are typically located at 15-120 AU (Kennedy & Wyatt\n2010). Thus, it may be possible for debris disks and giant planets\nat a few AU or less to appear uncorrelated (as is the case in the\ncurrent sample Bryden et al. 2009; K\u00f3sp\u00e1l et al. 2009) but the\nanti-correlation between eccentric giants and debris disks should\nbe clear for giant planets beyond roughly 5-10 AU. In addition,\nthere should be a minimal orbital radius (and a maximum temperature) for an outer planetesimal disk in a given system, de22\n\npending on the giant planet architecture. The statistics of debris\ndisks in known giant planet systems are currently too poor to\nprovide constraints (see discussion in section 5.2 of Paper 1).\nThe debris disk - terrestrial planet correlation exists for three\nreasons. First, terrestrial planet formation is less efficient in the\npresence of eccentric giant planets. Second, the destruction rate\nof outer planetesimal disks by ejection increases under the influence of eccentric giant planets. Third, we have assumed that any\nsystem that can form terrestrial planets can also produce a debris\ndisk.\nThe first reason is well-established from many dynamical studies (Chambers & Cassen 2002; Levison & Agnor 2003;\nRaymond et al. 2004; Raymond 2006; Raymond et al. 2006a,\n2009c; Morishima et al. 2010). As discussed above, the dynamics behind the second reason is sound and the only reasonable\nway to negate or temper the eccentric giant planet - debris disk\nanti-correlation is for there to exist a large radial gap between giant planets and outer planetesimal disks. The third reason is hard\nto constrain. As a blanket statement this assumption is almost\ncertainly incorrect, as the observed frequency of debris disks\nof \u223c16% (Trilling et al. 2008; Carpenter et al. 2009) is smaller\nthan the currently-estimated frequency of close-in super Earths\nof 20-50% (Howard et al. 2010, 2011; Mayor et al. 2011). Thus,\nthere are probably many systems that can form terrestrial planets but without a massive outer planetesimal disk. The reason\nfor the lower frequency of outer disks is unclear; it could be\nrelated to external perturbations from passing stars during the\nembedded cluster phase (Malmberg et al. 2007, 2011). Or perhaps outer planetesimal disks simply are not a common initial condition for planet formation, although that assertion appears to be at odds with the high frequency of disks around\nyoung stars (e.g Hillenbrand et al. 2008). One can imagine that\nthere could also exist systems with outer planetesimal disks\nbut very little mass in the inner disk, for example if a giant\nplanet migrated through and depleted the inner disk (although\nRaymond et al. 2006b; Mandell et al. 2007, shows that this depletion is much weaker than one would naively expect). Indeed,\nin our own Solar System Jupiter's inward-then-outward migration may have removed most of the mass from the asteroid\nbelt (Walsh et al. 2011). However, there is no evidence in the\nexoplanet distribution for systematic depletion of inner disks by\ngiant planet migration. Indeed, the radial distribution of giant\nexoplanets increases sharply beyond about 1 AU (Mayor et al.\n2011) such that terrestrial planets closer than 0.5-0.7 AU to their\nstars are probably only weakly affected by giant planets, at least\nthose with low to moderate eccentricities. In contrast, inner disks\ncertainly have a wide mass range and high-mass disks may form\nsuper Earths or Neptune-like planets rather than Earth-like planets (Ikoma et al. 2001; Raymond et al. 2008b).\nWe think that the most likely interpretation of current observations and theory is roughly as follows. Protoplanetary disks\nstart with a variety of masses and mass distributions, and are\nsubsequently divided into different regions by any giant planets that form. Formation models suggest that giant planets may\npreferentially form at a few to ten AU (Kokubo & Ida 2002;\nThommes et al. 2008; Levison et al. 2010), essentially dividing\ntheir disks into the distinct regions we have assumed: the inner\nterrestrial zone, the giant planet zone and the outer planetesimal\ndisk. In some systems these zones are not cleanly separated, for\nexample if the giant planets migrate very far outward or inward\nor if a relatively close stellar encounter disrupts the outer planetesimal disk. Indeed, observations suggest that there is probably\nan abundance of systems with inner terrestrial planet-forming\ndisks but without the outer planetesimals to produce debris disks.\n\n\f1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\nCase A\nCase B\n\n0.0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nTotal terrestrial planet mass (MEarth)\n\nFraction with >0.5 MEarth\n\nFraction detectable at 70 \u03bcm (1 Gyr)\n\nRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\nCase A\nCase B\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.01\n\n0.10\n1.00\n10.00\nF/Fstar (70 \u03bcm) at 1 Gyr\n\nFig. 19.

The Spitzer detection limit is shown as the dashed line. This\nrepresents a vertical slice through Fig. 19.\nHowever, we see no evidence or clear theory to contradict our\nassumption that all or at least most stars with debris disks also\nhave inner disks of protoplanets. Thus, we think that debris disks\ncan indeed act as signposts for systems that should have formed\nterrestrial planets. In contrast, in systems without debris disks\neccentric giant planets may act as signposts of terrestrial planet\ndestruction.\nTo summarize, we see no compelling argument against the\nassumptions we have made and we think that our two proposed\ncorrelations are reasonable.\n\n7. Conclusions\nIn Paper 1 (Raymond et al. 2011) we showed that old solar-type\nstars with bright cold dust correlate strongly with dynamically\ncalm environments that are conducive to efficient terrestrial accretion. The fact that both the inner and outer parts of planetary systems are sculpted by what lies in between \u2013 the giant\nplanets \u2013 yields a natural connection between terrestrial planet\nand debris disks. We predicted two observational correlations:\nan anti-correlation between eccentric giant planets and debris\ndisks, and a positive correlation between terrestrial planets and\ndebris disks. We also showed that the Solar System appears to\nbe a somewhat unusual case in terms of having a rich system\nof terrestrial planets but a severely depleted Kuiper belt with little cold dust, which is probably a result of the outward-directed,\nrelatively weak dynamical instability that caused the late heavy\nbombardment (Morbidelli et al. 2010).\nIn this paper we used six new sets of simulations to test the\neffect of several system parameters on the results from Paper 1.\nNone of the parameters qualitatively changed the eccentric giant\nplanet-debris disk anti-correlation or the debris disk-terrestrial\nplanet correlation but their effects were diverse and interesting:\n\u2013 Low-mass giant planets undergo planetesimal-driven migration that radially spreads the giant planets (the lowmass simulations). Systems with low-mass giant planet are very efficient at forming terrestrial planets and also at producing\n\nabundant observable dust simply because their weak giant\nplanet perturbations do not stifle these processes. Systems\nwith low-mass outer planets often produce isolated belts of\nplanetesimals orbiting between the giant planets. The probability of a system containing such a belt increases strongly\nwith decreasing outer giant planet mass and increasing separation between the giant planets.\n\u2013 In contrast, systems with equal-mass giant planets undergo\nthe strongest instabilities. In more than 2/3 of the equal\nsystems, all terrestrial material was destroyed, and all planetesimal disks were ejected in a similar fraction of cases\n(though not with a one to one correspondence). Given the\ntendency for more massive exoplanets to have more eccentric orbits (Wright et al. 2009), the equal systems may be\nrepresentative of the high-mass (M p & M J ) exoplanet systems.\n\u2013 The presence of 0.5 \u2212 2 M\u2295 objects in outer planetesimal\ndisks cause the disks to radially spread (the seeds simulations). The inward-spreading part of the disk is removed\nby interactions with giant planets (or, in systems without giant planets, presumably by accelerated collisional evolution)\nwhereas the outer part of the disk spreads to larger orbital\ndistances. Such cold disks are detectable at long but not short\nwavelengths. The presence of seeds may therefore explain\nthe very low frequency of stars with 25\u03bcm excess compared\nwith the frequency of 70\u03bcm excesses (Bryden et al. 2006;\nTrilling et al. 2008; Carpenter et al. 2009).\n\u2013 The widedisk simulations showed that a more massive and\nextended outer planetesimal disk stabilizes a significant fraction of systems because planet-planetesimal interactions allow higher-mass unstable giant planet systems to radially\nspread out and damp their eccentricities. Thus, if all systems\nof giant planet systems form in similar, near-unstable configurations, the outer planetesimal disk mass may be a key\nfactor in the fraction of systems that end up being unstable.\nMore massive outer disks produce larger quantities of dust,\nin particular at long wavelengths that are dominated by the\n\n23\n\n\fRaymond et al.: Debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation II\n\noutermost part of the planetesimal disks where the collisional\ntimescales are the longest.\n\u2013 The presence of disk gas for the first 0.5 Myr of the system's evolution does not have a strong effect on the outcome\n(the gas simulations). The debris disk-terrestrial planet correlation and the eccentric giant planet - debris disk anticorrelation are not affected.\nWe constructed two samples of simulations called cases A\nand B that matched the observed exoplanet mass and eccentricity distributions. Case A was built on the mixed simulations and\ncase B on a combination of the equal and the high-mass unstable component of the lowmass simulations. These cases attempt to bracket the likely initial conditions for planet-planet\nscattering in the known systems (e.g., Chatterjee et al. 2008;\nJuri\u0107 & Tremaine 2008; Raymond et al. 2010). Each of these\ncases clearly show the eccentric giant planet - debris disk anticorrelation and the debris disk-terrestrial planet correlation.\nThe only plausible alternative to the eccentric giant planet\n- debris disk anti-correlation is for outer planetesimal disks to\nbe located far away from the giant planets and thus to be extremely cold (see section 6). Given that the known exoplanets\nare dominated by relatively close-in planets (typically within a\nfew AU) and that the planetesimals responsible for the known\ndebris disks are at 15-120 AU (Kennedy & Wyatt 2010), it is not\nsurprising that the expected eccentric giant planet - debris disk\nanti-correlation has not yet been detected (Bryden et al. 2009,\nsee also section 5.2 of Paper 1). However, we predict that it will\nbe seen in upcoming datasets that include more distant planets.\nThe only plausible alternative to the debris disk-terrestrial\nplanet correlation is for star with debris disks to be systematically depleted in their inner (terrestrial) regions and for outer\nplanetesimal disks to be systematically cold enough to be uncorrelated with eccentric giant planets. Although it is easy to imagine scenarios in which this may occur \u2013 for example, a system in\nwhich an inward-migrating giant planet depletes the inner disk\n\u2013 there is no observational evidence or self-consistent theoretical model that suggests that such scenarios should be common\nor correlated with debris disks. Thus, we predict that upcoming\ndatasets will find a strong correlation between debris disks and\nthe presence of terrestrial planets.\nThe frequency of debris disks around Sun-like stars older\nthan 1 Gyr is \u223c16% (Trilling et al. 2008), which is lower\nthan the observed frequency of close-in super Earth planets (Howard et al. 2010, 2011; Mayor et al. 2011). Thus, there\nis certainly a large population of systems that can form terrestrial planets but without the outer planetesimal disks needed to\nproduce debris disks. In these systems, direct radial velocity observations or constraints on the giant planet architecture may offer the best insight for constraining the existence of terrestrial\nplanets. But stars with debris disks most likely also had abundant material for building terrestrial planets. Thus, debris disks\ncan indeed act as signposts of (past) terrestrial planet formation.\nTo sum up, our main result is a prediction that debris disks\nshould be anti-correlated with systems containing eccentric giant planets and correlated with the presence of terrestrial planets.\nSolar-type stars with bright cold debris disks and no giant planets are excellent candidates to search for Earth-like planets. In\ncontrast, systems without debris disks and with eccentric giant\nplanets are probably not good candidates for terrestrial planets.\nUpcoming observations will test our predictions.\nAcknowledgements.
