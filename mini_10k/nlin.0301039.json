E-mail:hennigd@physik.fu-berlin.de\n\nPreprint submitted to Physica D\n\n19 March 2002\n\n\fWith the perspective to possible applications in molecular electronics biomaterials are supposed to play an important role because they may offer the ultimate way to miniaturization and their attributed electrical transport properties are expected to be markedly different from those of traditional macroscopic\nconductors [2]. In this context enormous effort has been directed towards investigations of conductivity of DNA viewed as a promising conduit for charge\ntransport on nanoscales [3]. So far the findings concerning conductivity of\nDNA have been controversial. There are the results of recent measurements\nindicating that DNA behaves as a well conducting one-dimensional molecular\nwire [4]-[10]. In contrast it was reported that DNA is insulating [11] and for\nshort oligomers built up from base pairs of the same type semiconductivity\nwas observed [12]. This qualitative discrepancy is shared also by theoretical\nfindings so that it remains unclear whether DNA is conductive or not. For example a theoretical investigation based on first principle calculations suggests\nthe absence of dc-conductivity in DNA [13]. On the other hand there stand\nthe studies using various assumptions for modeling the DNA structure which\nfocus on different aspects such as the influence of aperiodicity, temperature\ndriven fluctuations and aggregation effects on the energetic control of charge\nmigration which have all come to the conclusion that DNA is a conductor\n[14]-[18].\nThe detailed understanding of the conduction mechanism of DNA remains still\nan unsolved task. Different attempts to model the charge transport of DNA\nwere based on transport via coherent tunneling [1], classical diffusion under the\nconditions of temperature-driven fluctuations [16], incoherent phonon-assisted\nhopping [19],[20], variable range hopping between localized states [17] and\ncharge carriages mediated by polarons [21],[22] and solitons [23].\nIn the present work we use for the theoretical description of charge transport\nin DNA a nonlinear approach facilitating the concept of polaron respectively\nbreather solutions. The structure of the bent double helix of \u03bb\u2212DNA is modeled by a sterical network of oscillators in the frame of the base pair picture\n[24],[25],[26] taking into account deformations of the hydrogen bonds within a\nbase pair and twist motions between adjacent base pairs. The electron motion\nis described by a tight-binding system. It is assumed that the electron motion\nis predominantly influenced by vibrational modes of the double helix. The\nnonlinear interaction between the electron and the vibrational modes causes\nthe formation of polarons respectively electron-vibron breathers supporting\ncharge localization and transport.\nThe aim of the current investigation is to elucidate the role played by static\nparametrical disorder and complex structural effects due to irregular deviations from the ordered helical shape of the double helix (reflected in random arrangements of the positions of the bases) with regard to the charge\ntransport in DNA. There arises at least one interesting question, namely: Is\n2\n\n\flong-lived and stable charge transport in DNA achievable at all under the\nimpact of disorder ? To tackle this problem in our paper we exploit analytical\nand numerical methods from the theory of (nonlinear) dynamical systems in\ncombination with the theory of (linear) disordered systems. The paper is organized as follows: In the first section we describe the model for the charge\ntransport along the steric structure of the bent DNA double helix. The second section is concerned with the construction of polaron respectively static\nelectron-vibron breather solutions of the nonlinear lattice system when parametrical and structural disorder effects are taken into account. In section 4\nwe discuss the mobility properties of the polarons respectively electron-vibron\nbreathers and their transport efficiency in dependence on the degree of disorder contained in the on-site energies and/or in structural arrangements of the\nhelix. In a subsequent section\nwe invoke the Floquet analysis to explain also the mobility of the polarons and\nbreathers in terms of their spectral properties. Finally, we present a summary\nand discussion of the results.\n\n2\n\nModel Hamiltonian for charge transfer along DNA\n\nDNA chains are quite flexible and exhibit structural fluctuations influencing\nthe transport properties. Our model is designed to cover the basic features of\nthe DNA double helix structure needed for a proper description of the charge\ntransport dynamics under the impact of fluctuating base motions. Despite the\nfact that the charge transport proceeds across a one-dimensional channel of\nbase stacks spanning along the sugar-phosphate backbone so that DNA can\neffectively be viewed as a one-dimensional molecular wire [27] some significant details of the three-dimensional DNA structure have to be incorporated\nin the model. For the physical description of DNA molecules their detailed\nchemical structure can be neglected. They can be simply considered as bent\ndouble-stranded systems with an adequate number of parameters sufficient\nfor modeling the considered physical process. In the frame of simple DNA\nmodels such as the base pair picture the bases have been treated as single\nnondeformable entities. The helicoidal structure of DNA is then conveniently\ndescribed in a cylindrical reference system where each base pair possesses two\ndegrees of freedom, namely a radial variable measuring the transversal displacements of the base pair (that is deformations of the H-bond) and its angle\nwith a reference axis in a plane perpendicular to the helix backbone which defines the twist of the helix [26]. In Fig. 1 we depict schematically the structure\nof the DNA model.\nWith relevance to charge migration the most influential fluctuating motions\nof DNA originate from tranverse vibrations of the bases relative to each other\n3\n\n\fR\n\n\u03b8 +\u03b8\n\n0\n\nn\n\nn n\u22121\n\n0\n\nl+\nd\n\nn\n\nn\u2212\n\n1\n\n0\n\nr\n\nl\n\n0\n\n\u03b8\n\n0\n\nFig. 1. Sketch of the helicoidal structure of the DNA model, the bases being represented by bullets. Geometrical parameters R0 , \u03b80 , l0 and the radial and angular\nvariables rn and \u03b8n n\u22121 , respectively are indicated.\n\nwithin each base plane, i.e. the base pair distance stretchings/compressions\nand the torsional variations of the helicoidal twist dominating longitudinal\n(acoustic strand) phonons [16] because the sugar-phosphate chains are rather\nstretch proof [27]. Therefore it is justified to discard the impact of longitudinal\nvibrations and the considered motion is restricted to the base pair planes\n[15]. Furthermore, the angular twist and radial vibrational motions evolve\nindependently on two different time scales and can be regarded as decoupled\ndegrees of freedom in the harmonic treatment of the normal mode vibrations\nof DNA [28].\nThe Hamiltonian for the electron migration along a strand in DNA consists\nof three parts\nH = Hel + Hrad + Htwist ,\n(1)\nwith Hel representing the part corresponding to the particle charge transport\nover the base pairs, Hrad describes the dynamics of the H-bond vibrations and\nHtwist models the dynamics of the relative twist angle between two consecutive\nbase pairs. The electronic part is given by a tight-binding system\nHel =\n\nX\n\nEn |cn |2 \u2212 Vn n\u22121\n\nn\n\n\u0010\n\nc\u2217n cn\u22121 + cn c\u2217n\u22121\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nThe index n denotes the site of the n\u2212th base on one of the two strands and\ncn determines the probability that the electron occupies this site. En is the\nlocal electronic energy and Vnn\u22121 stands for the transfer matrix element which\nis responsible for the transport of the electron along the stacked base pairs.\n4\n\n\fThe vibronic part Hrad takes into account radial displacements of the base\nunits from their equilibrium positions within the base pair plane connected\nwith deformations of the hydrogen bonds linking two bases. The corresponding\npart of the Hamiltonian treating the bond vibrations classically and harmonically is given by\nHrad =\n\nX\nn\n\n\"\n\nMn \u03a92r rn2\n(pnr )2\n+\n2 Mn\n2\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nwith the momenta (pnr )2 conjugate to the radial coordinates rn measuring\nthe deviation from the equilibrium length of a hydrogen bond along the line\nbridging two bases of a base pair, \u03a9r is the frequency and Mn is the reduced\nmass of a base pair.\nThe twist motion part reads as\n\nHtwist =\n\nX\nn\n\n\u0010\n\npn\u03b8 n\u22121\n[\n2 Jn\n\n\u00112\n\n+\n\nJn \u03a92\u03b8 \u03b8n2 n\u22121\n],\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b8n n\u22121 is the relative angle between two adjacent base pairs quantifying\ndisplacements from its equilibrium twist angle \u03b80 and Jn is the reduced moment\nof inertia.\nWe emphasize that in the context of charge transport in DNA the nonlinear dynamics of large amplitude structural transitions are not of interest because charge transport processes are thought to be mainly facilitated by soft\nfluctuational vibrational modes allowing the harmonic approximation of their\ndynamics.\nThe interaction between the electronic variable and the structure variables rn\nand \u03b8n n\u22121 stems from the parameter dependence of the electronic parameters\nEn and Vn n\u22121 . The diagonal term expressing the most efficient coupling is of\nthe form\nEn = En0 + k rn ,\n(5)\nand takes into account the modulation of the on-site electronic energy En0\nby the radial vibrations of the base pairs.

Furthermore in the linear\n6\n\n\flimit case emerging for \u03b1 = k = 0 the Anderson model is obtained for random\nEn0 [30],[31].\nRegarding the dynamical energy exchange between the various degrees of freedom we state that due to the large differences between the electronic and vibronic frequencies we are able to prove rigorously that the energy exchange is\nsuppressed on time scales growing exponentially with the ratio of the frequencies. Corresponding bounds on the energy exchange suppression are derived\nwith the help of Nekhoroshev-like arguments [32],[33]. Furthermore applying\nthe concept of the anti-integrable limit [34] we are able to prove the existence\nof breather solutions for the coupled system (12)-(14).

In the ordered case the electronic\nwave function is localized at the central lattice site and the amplitudes decay\nmonotonically and exponentially with growing distance from this central site.\nWe remark that the spatial extension of the polaron decreases with increased\ncoupling strength k and there is a smooth transition from large to small polarons. Analogously, enlarging the off-diagonal coupling strength \u03b1 leads also\nto enhanced degree of localization. The size of the polarons plays a crucial role\nfor their mobility in the sense that for large up to medium polarons coherent\nmotion can be activated whereas small polarons are immobile due to their\npinning to the discrete lattice [38],[39]. The associated patterns of the static\nradial and angular displacements of the bases are shown in Fig. 2 (b) and (c),\nrespectively. Like the electronic wave function the radial and angular displacements are exponentially localized at the central lattice site (base pair). Notice\nthat due to the overall minus sign of the radial and angular excitation patterns\nthe H-bridges get compressed while the helix experiences a local unwinding\naround the occupation peak of the localized electron.\nFor a more realistic study we take static diagonal disorder in the on-site electronic energy En0 into account. The random values caused for example by the\ninhomogeneous broadening of the sites of distinct ion pairs with different energies were simulated by random potentials [\u2212\u2206E, \u2206E] with mean value \u0112 = 0\nand different mean standard deviations \u2206E. (Note that any E0 cn term on the\nr.h.s. of Eq. (12) with constant E0 can be eliminated by a gauge transformation\ncn \u2192 exp(\u2212iE0 t/\u03c4 )cn .)\n9\n\n\fFig. 3. Breather motion along the DNA in the ordered case. Motion is initiated by\nan initial kick of the velocities {\u1e59n } directed along the corresponding pinning mode\ncomponent. The kick amplitude is \u03bbr = 0.25.\n(a) Uniformly moving electronic breather.\n(b) The associated moving breather in the radial displacements.\n(c) The angular breather contribution consisting of a small amplitude breather\npinned at the starting site and a relatively large amplitude moving breather component propagating in alliance with the electron and radial breathers.\n\n10\n\n\fGenerally the localized excitation patterns do not change qualitatively when\ndiagonal disorder is taken into account. Compared with the ordered case one\nmerely observes a shift of the excitation peak away from the central lattice\nsite depending on the respective realization of the random potential. However,\nsince in the presence of diagonal disorder the translational invariance of the\nlattice system is broken the localized amplitude pattern is no longer reflection\nsymmetric with respect to a distinguished lattice site as opposed to the corresponding symmetric localized state of the ordered system. Moreover we find\nthat the combined effect of the two localization mechanisms, viz. nonlinear\npolaron and linear Anderson-mode formation respectively, leads to enhancement of the degree of localization compared to the case when only one of the\ntwo mechanisms acts.\nFurthermore, real DNA molecules exhibit random structural imperfections of\ntheir double helix caused e.g. by the random base sequence, the deforming impact of the chemical surroundings when DNA gets buffeted by water molecules\nand/or the varying hydrophobic potential of the base pair interactions depending on the ambient aqueous solvent that may leave the involved helix\nstructures in irregularly distorted shapes. Accordingly, the structural disorder\nis incorporated in our model by randomly distributed equilibrium positions of\nthe bases so that the resulting irregular helical DNA matrix deviates from the\nperfectly regular helix structure.\nTo be precise, we consider randomly distributed torsional coordinates \u03b8n n\u22121\nand radii rn . Since the positions (actually, the distances) govern the value of\nthe corresponding transfer matrix elements Vn n\u22121 = V0 (1 \u2212 \u03b1dn n\u22121 ) nondiagonal disorder is induced in the latter at the same time. Random transfer\nintegrals along the helix were used to represent random base pair sequences\nfor which the charge transport along DNA was discussed recently in a model\nrelying on localized electron states [15].\n\n4\n\nCharge transport mediated by mobile polarons and breathers\n\nIn this section we study the charge transport supported by mobile polarons\nrespectively breathers propagating along DNA. To activate polaron motion\nan established method is provided by proper stimulation of localized internal\nnormal modes of certain shape and frequency which are also called pinning\nmodes [40]. The identification of possibly existing pinning modes is related to\nthe linear stability analysis of the polarons. In order to investigate the stability\nof the polarons with respect to linear perturbations we derive the linearized\nsystem for which we impose small perturbations on the stationary polaron\nsolution (\u03a6n , rn(0) , \u03b8n(0) ) in the form:\n11\n\n\fcn (t) = [ \u03a6n + \u03b4cn (t) ] exp(\u2212i Et/\u03c4 )\nrn (t) = rn(0) + \u03b4rn (t)\n\u03b8n (t) = \u03b8n(0) + \u03b4\u03b8n (t) ,\n\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03b4cn , \u03b4rn and \u03b4\u03b8n are small time-dependent variables. Substitution of\n(21)-(23) into Eqs. (12)-(14) and retaining only the terms linear in the perturbations results in the system of tangent equations. The stability analysis\nis then performed using Floquet theory.\nTo this end we integrate the linear system of the tangent equations over one\nperiod T = 2\u03c0 \u03c4 /E yielding the Floquet map\n\u03b4x(nT ) = F n \u03b4x(0) ,\n\n(24)\n\nwith the Floquet matrix F determining the evolution of the initial set of variables x(0) = (Re\u03b4cn (0), Im\u03b4cn (0), \u03b4rn (0), \u03b4 \u1e59n (0), \u03b4\u03b8n (0), \u03b4 \u03b8\u0307n (0)) after times\nnT . To ensure linear stability all eigenvalues exp(i \u03c8n ) of the Floquet matrix F have to lie on the unit circle, i.e. the Floquet arguments \u03c8n have to be\nreal-valued. Intensive numerical investigations in a wide parameter range have\nproved that all the polarons gained from the map method are linearly stable.\nMoreover the Floquet analysis supplies the frequencies of the normal modes\nvia the relation \u03c9\u03c8 = \u03c9[\u03c8/(2\u03c0) + m] with \u03c8 expressed in rad and m is an\narbitrary integer number. We identified the pinning modes for given sets of\nparameters. According to [40] we initiate the motion of polarons through suitable perturbations of the velocity variables \u1e59n (t) and/or \u03b8\u0307n targeted in the\ndirection of the pinning mode, that is we use for the numerical integration of\nthe system (12)-(14) the following initial conditions\nn\n\no\n\n\u03a6n , 0, rn(0) , 0, \u03b8n(0) , 0 + {0, 0, 0, \u03bbr \u03ber , 0, \u03bb\u03b8 \u03be\u03b8 } ,\n\n(25)\n\nwith the normalized momentum parts \u03ber,\u03b8 of the pinning mode and \u03bbr,\u03b8 are\nthe perturbation strengths (for details see [40]).\nOrdered case\nIn Fig. 3 we present results for the activation of breather motion along DNA\nin the ordered case. We integrated the set of coupled nonlinear equations\n(12)-(14) with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and the accuracy of the\ncomputation was checked through monitoring the conservation of the total\nP\nenergy as well as the norm n |cn (t)|2 = 1. The applied kicking strength\nis \u03bbr = 0.02 corresponding to an amount of radial kinetic energy of the order of 200 meV . Interestingly, we found that there exists no angular pinning\nmode component \u03be\u03b8 (see further below) so that alone the excitation of the\nradial component \u03ber produces long-lived stable polaron and breather motions.\nHence, our findings suggest that higher frequency radial fluctuational modes\n12\n\n\fof DNA instigate the propagation of localized structures along DNA rather\nthan low frequency twist fluctuational modes. The Fig. 3 (a) demonstrates\nthat the electronic component of the polaron moves with uniform velocity\nalong the lattice maintaining its localized shape throughout the journey. In\nthe same manner the radial polaron part travels as a localized wave along the\nstrand so that the electron propagation is accompanied by a local and temporal contraction of the radii. However, the angular static polaron component\nsplits up into two parts when the radial pinning mode is initially imposed. At\nthe starting position there remains a standing breather of comparatively large\namplitudes which reverse periodically their sign in the course of time. Thus\nthe helix experiences alternately a local winding and unwinding around its\ncentral base pair. In addition a second breather of relatively small and exclusively negative amplitude propagates in unison with the electronic and radial\npolaron components. The result is that the region of the helix which is traversed by the electron gets locally untwisted. As the quantitative assessment\nof the charge transport is concerned we note that the breather travels across\nseventy sites (base pairs) in a thousand (dimensionless) time units meaning\nthat physically the charge conduction across the base pairs of DNA over a\ndistance of 238\u00c5 takes \u223c 0.16ns leading to a higher transport rate than a\ntypical one found for protein conductivity [15]. This underlines the status\nascribed to DNA molecules as promising candidates establishing fast and efficient charge transport in (albeit only theorized yet) molecular electronical\nengineering utilizing them as molecular wires.\nStatic diagonal disorder\nIn the presence of diagonal static disorder, that is when the on-site electronic\nenergies En0 are represented by random numbers distributed in the interval\n|En0 | < \u2206E with width \u2206E, we find that mobile breathers exist up to a\ncritical degree of disorder \u2206Ecrit and conductivity persists. (Let us stress that\nit was indeed experimentally found that the random sequence \u03bb\u2212DNA is an\nelectrical conductor [9].) Beyond this critical value continuous propagation of\nthe breathers along the lattice is prevented.\nThis behavior is illustrated in Fig. 4 displaying the spatio-temporal evolution\nof the electronic amplitude |cn (t)|2 . While for a relatively small amount of\ndisorder \u2206E = 0.05 the electronic breather (together with its radial and torsional counterparts) is able to travel uniformly along the lattice for a ten times\nincreased \u2206E = 0.5 the breather motion is restricted to a neighborhood of the\ninitially excited position around which it wanders in an oscillatory manner.\nRegarding mobility there act two competing mechanisms in the combined\ndisordered nonlinear system, namely a linear Anderson-type one related with\nthe effects of disorder which attempts to pin the modes (bear in mind that\nthe linear Anderson-modes are supposed to be immobile) and opposed to this\n13\n\n\fFig. 4. Electron breather motion along DNA with diagonal disorder for two different\nvalues of the width \u2206E of the random distribution of the on-site electronic energy\n|En0 |.\n(a) Width \u2206E = 0.05.

Confined electron breather with positions oscillating itinerantly around the initial lattice position.\n\nthere operates the nonlinear mechanism utilizing the pinning mode to activate\nmotion. The relative strength of these two mechanisms \u2206E/\u03bbr determines then\nbreather mobility. In order to summarize the results for the breather mobility\nin the presence of diagonal disorder we display in 5 the temporal behavior of\n14\n\n\fthe first momentum of the electronic occupation probability defined as\nn\u0304(t) =\n\nX\n\nn|cn (t)|2 ,\n\n(26)\n\nn\n\nFig. 5. Diagonal disorder. The position of the center of the electron breather as\na function of time and for different amounts of disorder. Full line (Ordered case),\nshort dashed line (\u2206E = 0.025), dashed-dotted line (\u2206E = 0.050), dotted line\n(\u2206E = 0.100) and long dashed line (\u2206E = 0.500).\n\nwhich determines the position of the breather center as a function of time.\nThe breathers are mobile and propagate unidirectionally with (virtually) constant velocity along the lattice up to an amount of disorder \u2206E \u2243 0.045.\nGenerally, the larger the width \u2206E the lower becomes this velocity. Finally,\nfor an overcritical amount of disorder the breather performs oscillatory motions around its starting lattice position. The frequency of these oscillations\ndiminishes gradually with more enlarged \u2206E and simultaneously the excursions from the starting site get continuously stronger confined. Despite the\nnon-directed character of its motion even for a moderate amount of disorder\n\u2206E = 0.05 the breather is able to travel as far as twenty lattice sites away\nfrom its starting position. Eventually linear Anderson-type disorder effects\noverwhelm more and more the nonlinear activation mechanism for breather\nmotion through the excitation of the nonlinear pinning mode.\nRandom double helix structure\nConcerning the impact of structural disorder we considered random distributions of the base pair spacings rn \u2212 r0 \u2208 [\u2212\u2206, \u2206] and the twist angles\n\u03b8n \u2212 \u03b80 \u2208 [\u2212\u2206, \u2206] with different mean standard deviations \u2206.\nFor representative results we averaged over several realizations of structural\ndisorder. The results for the temporal evolution of the electron breather center\n15\n\n\fFig. 6. Structural disorder and random double helix structure.

Assignment of the line types to the increasing mean\nstandard deviations ranging up to 10% of the respective mean value: Full line (1%),\ndashed dotted line (5%) and dashed line (10%).\n\nare depicted in Fig. 6. We conclude that structural disorder does not significantly affect the mobility of the breathers. For growing degree of disorder\nmerely the propagation velocity gets reduced. Even in the case of fairly strong\ndisorder \u2206 = 10% (dashed line) the breather is still able to propagate steadily.\nWe studied also the polaron mobility under the impact of combined static\ndiagonal and structural disorder and found that the strong pinning effect generated by static diagonal disorder prevails over the more harmless and merely\nvelocity-reducing influence of structural irregularities. Particularly the last result is in compliance with the findings in [41] where it was reported that\nhopping conductivity in proteins and DNA is influenced first of all by the\nmolecular conformations and not by their sequences.\n\n5\n\nFloquet analysis\n\nIt is instructive to consider also the linear limit case of the coupled nonlinear\nelectron-vibration system even though the results obtained throughout this\npaper bear essentially nonlinear character. The study of the linear limit system\nitself and its Floquet analysis can be applied as a reference and as a tool for\nobtaining useful information for the interpretation of the Floquet analysis of\nthe fully nonlinear system.\n16\n\n\f5.1 The linear system\nThe linear limit system is derived from the Eqns. (12)-(14) for \u03b1 = k = 0\ngiving\ni \u03c4 \u010bn = \u2212cn+1 \u2212 cn\u22121\nr\u0308n = \u2212rn\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\n\u03b8\u0308n n\u22121 = \u2212\u03a92 \u03b8n n\u22121\n\n(29)\n\nIn the first equation the terms En0 cn , which in a homogeneous system reduce to E0 cn , have been eliminated through the gauge transformation cn \u2192\ncn exp(\u2212i E0 t/\u03c4 ). In the linear limit the electronic and vibrational degrees of\nfreedom are decoupled.\nTo construct the electronic state we substitute in Eq. (27), cn (t) = \u03c6n exp(\u2212iE t/\u03c4 )\nwith time-independent \u03c6n yielding the linear stationary discrete Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation: E \u03c6n = \u2212\u03c6n+1 \u2212\u03c6n\u22121 . With the Bloch mode solutions \u03c6n = exp(i q n)\nwe get then the dispersion relation: E = \u2212ei q \u2212 e\u2212i q = \u22122 cos q . The linear\nelectronic energy spectrum runs from \u22122 to 2. The polaron in the full system\ndisplayed in Fig. 2 possesses an energy value E = \u22122.064 which is slightly\nbelow the lower band edge E = \u22122 assigned to a wave number q = 0 and in\nthe linear regime the frequencies are in the range wp = E/\u03c4 \u2208 [\u22127.75, 7.75].\nConclusively, the time scale for the evolution of the angular (radial) variables\n\u03b8n n\u22121 (rn ) represented by independent harmonic oscillators with frequencies\n1 and \u03a9 = 0.0842, respectively, is two orders (one order) of magnitude larger\nthan the one of the electron.\nThe linear analysis is also useful to understand the origin of many of the numerically calculated Floquet arguments for the fully nonlinear system. The\nvalues of the variables rn and \u03b8n n\u22121 after a period T = 2 \u03c0/wp = 2 \u03c0 \u03c4 /E are:\nrn (T ) = exp(i 2 \u03c0 /wp ) rn (0) and \u03b8n n\u22121 (T ) = exp(i 2 \u03c0 \u03a9/wp ) \u03b8n n\u22121 (0). Therefore, their corresponding Floquet arguments are given by 2 \u03c0/wp and 2 \u03c0 \u03a9/wp ,\nfor rn and \u03b8n n\u22121 , respectively, which are attributed to angular positions in the\ncomplex plane with values around \u00b1450 and \u00b13.90 for polarons with energies\nslightly below E = \u22122 and with increased |E| these angular positions shift to\nlower values on the unit circle.\n5.2 Results of the Floquet analysis\nThe numerical integration of the system of tangent equations over one period\nof the polaron's oscillation T = 2 \u03c0 \u03c4 /|E| allows us to obtain the actual Floquet\nmatrix. Its eigenvalues can be written as exp(i \u03c8n ) with \u03c8n being the Floquet\n17\n\n\farguments. The system is linearly stable provided all the Floquet arguments\nare real. As noted earlier in this paper within the range of parameters studied\nin this paper linear stability is assured, but this is not the only information\nthat can be gained from the Floquet analysis.\nIn order to relate the positions of the numerous eigenvalues of the Floquet\nmatrix in the complex plane to the various degrees of freedom contained in the\nsystem it is elucidating to study first an anti-coupling limit in the electronic\nsubsystem. Introducing an auxiliary tunable coupling parameter 0 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264\n1, which corresponds to the transfer integral in the scaled system, the anticoupling limit is obtained with \u03bc = 0 and the actually studied coupled system\nwith \u03bc = 1.\nFor the decoupled electron system (\u03bc = 0) the value of the energy E can be\neasily derived with the help of the Eqs. (15) and (19), giving E\u03a6n = \u2212k 2 |\u03a6|2 \u03a6n\nand rn(0) = \u2212k|\u03a6n |2 , which leads to E = \u22121 for the localized state \u03a6n = \u03b4n 0\nand k = 1 as a typical value. Therefore, the rn -multipliers are in the vicinity\nof \u03c0/2, the \u03b8n n\u22121 's lie at small angles at both sides of (1, 0) and the cn 's are\nlocated at (1, 0) on the unit circle, in accordance with the analysis performed\nin 5.1. As we switch on the coupling \u03bc and increase it up to the actual value\n\u03bc = 1, we can follow the evolution of the multipliers. Eventually, for \u03bc = 1\nthe rn 's and \u03b8n n\u22121 's have moved to positions with about half their initial\nangle values while spreading a little on the unit circle (the \u03b8n n\u22121 's to lesser\nextent though). The cn 's separate from (1, 0) and invade the whole circle, as\na consequence of the nonlinear coupling between the electron amplitudes and\nthe vibrations. The exceptions are the pair at (1, 0), corresponding to the\nphase mode, and another isolated pair close to this point. The latter pair is\nassociated with the spatially antisymmetric pinning mode, responsible for the\nmobility of the polaron. Note that the linear approximation described in 5.1 is\nan approximation for the radial and angular variables. The Floquet multipliers\nfor the decoupled and full systems, respectively are shown in Fig. 7.\nIn order to illuminate further the role played by the vibrational modes with\nrespect to the initiation of mobility of the polaron we cast the Floquet matrix\nF in the form of a supermatrix formed by submatrices:\n\nF =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec Fc c\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec Fr c\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\nFc r Fc \u03b8 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\n\uf8f7\n,\nFr r Fr \u03b8 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\nF\u03b8 c F\u03b8 r F\u03b8 \u03b8\n\n(30)\n\n\uf8f8\n\nand the indices of the submatrices refer to the origin of their entries. From the\narguments of the eigenvalues of the submatrices an/or combinations of them,\nit is possible to deduce additional information about the spectral features\nattributed to the various degrees of freedom contained in the coupled nonlinear\n18\n\n\fImaginary part\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n0.5\nReal part\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n0.5\nReal part\n\n1\n\nFig. 7.

The matrix Fc c appears in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. To\nrecover the pinning mode of the complete system it suffices to consider only the\nsubsystem consisting of the electronic part coupled to the radial motions for\nwhich the Floquet matrix reduces to the submatrix FC R = (Fc c Fc r ; Fr c Fr r ),\nwhich means that the mobility of the polaron is mainly a consequence of the\ncoupling between the electron amplitudes and the radial variables and that\nthe electron will not move within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The\nFigs. 8 and 9\nillustrate these statements. The left (right) part of the Fig. 8 shows the multipliers of Fr r (F\u03b8 \u03b8 ). In comparison with the linear case studied in the preceding section we note that while the radial components of the multipliers shifted\ntheir positions to lower angles and exhibit some spread the angular multipliers\nhardly alter their position. Hence, perturbations of the angular twist motions\nin the context of the coupled system resemble the behavior of the linear limit\nsystem. The left part of Fig. 9 depicts the eigenvalues of Fc r in the vicinity of\n(1, 0). The pair of pinning mode eigenvalues is recognizable. In the right part\nof the figure the normalized pinning mode is portrayed.\nMoreover, it should be pointed out that for larger elongations of \u03b8n n\u22121 , beyond\nthe range where the linear expansion of dn n\u22121 is valid, there exists also an\nangular pinning mode as a consequence of the coupling between the electronic\namplitudes and the angular variables.\nThe fact that the disorder eventually prevents the polaron from being moved\ncan also be explained with the help of the Floquet multipliers. When the\ndegree of disorder is increased the pinning mode eigenvalues move progressively\naway from (1, 0) towards larger arguments \u03c8 and approach the rest of the Fr\n19\n\n\fImaginary part\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22120.5\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n0.5\nReal part\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n0.5\nReal part\n\n1\n\nFig. 8.

Eventually the system is too far\naway from the instability due to the marginal mode, which appears when the\npair of pinning mode eigenvalues collapses at (1, 0). This is easy to understand,\nas the disorder brings about a decoupling of the variables, favoring localized,\nstationary, isolated modes.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nIn the present work we have studied an electron transfer mechanism in DNA\nrelying on the coupling of the charge carrying unit to the vibrational modes of\nDNA responsible for the formation of polarons and electron-vibron breathers.\nThe steric structure of the double helix of \u03bb\u2212DNA has been described in the\ncontext of the base-pair picture considering angular and radial vibrational\n20\n\n\f5\n\n4.5\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\n\u03c8n (\u00b0)\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n\u2206E\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\nFig. 10.

We have focused interest on the initiation of longrange and stable polaron and breather motion along the DNA structure when\nstatic and/or structural disorder inherent to any real DNA molecule is taken\ninto account. We remark that the proposed polaron-like transport mechanism\napplies to electron hole conduction too. In the first part of the paper we have\nconstructed exact stationary localized solutions (polarons and static electronvibron breathers) with the help of a nonlinear map approach. We have found\nthat the interplay of disorder and nonlinearity amplifies the degree of localization in comparison with cases when either disorder or nonlinearity alone\nis present. With concern to mobile electron-vibron breather solutions, whose\nmotion is activated through a kick mechanism utilizing the pinning mode,\nwith the current work we have demonstrated that they are fairly robust when\nthe electron-vibration system is subjected to randomness. Generally, even for\na moderate amount of disorder the breathers retain their localized shapes\nand support directed, long-ranged coherent electron transfer along strands of\nthe bent double helix. In particular the last result suggests that DNA seems\nsuitable for the design of (one-dimensional) functional nanostructures as ingredients of molecular nanoelectronical devices. Furthermore, we have observed\nthat the electron breather is accompanied by vibrational breathers in the radial as well as angular components, respectively causing local and temporal\ndeformations of the traversed region of the double helix. Conclusively, efficient\ncharge transport in DNA proceeds on the condition that the double helix undergoes structural changes which is exemplary for the interplay of structure\n21\n\n\fand function in flexible and adaptive biomolecules.\n\nAcknowledgments\nOne of the authors (D.H.) acknowledges support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via a Heisenberg fellowship (He 3049/1-1).
