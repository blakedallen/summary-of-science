Introduction\nA fundamental property of the superconducting state is that it exhibits quantum\ncoherence at the macroscopic scale, a feature that has been used to probe the validity\nrange of quantum mechanics beyond the microscopic realm [1, 2]. The development\nof quantum information science and the experimental progress in the manufacturing\nand control of superconducting-based quantum circuits has allowed for novel proposals\naimed at implementing quantum information processing using Josephson qubits [3]. This\ngeneric denomination refers to qubit realizations that involve the charge [4] or the flux [5]\ndegree of freedom in superconducting devices (also see References [6, 7, 8, 9]). The\ncoherent coupling of two charge qubits and the implementation of conditional gate\noperations [10], as well as the coupling of two flux qubits [11], have been demonstrated\nexperimentally, and there is currently an increasing activity in the field. Interesting\napplications include proposals to interface such devices with optical elements in order to\ncreate hybrid technologies [12]; or to use them for quantum communication [13, 14, 28].\nIt needs to be realised however that the technological barriers for full scale quantum\ncomputation are formidable. Thus there is a need for intermediate experiments that are\ninteresting and non-trivial yet less demanding than implementing quantum computation.\nThe exploration of many-body dynamics provides such a platform. Crucially, the\nfabrication of arrays that involve N \u223c 50 Josephson qubits has already been achieved\nin the laboratory [15], and one of our aims in the present work is to make realistic\npredictions about their dynamical entanglement properties. In order to do so, we will\ntake into account the influence of certain general forms of noise and disorder on the\nsystem.\nA well-understood source of noise in any Josephson device is due to electromagnetic\nfluctuations in its background circuitry [16]. In the case of a single superconducting\nqubit, generic spin or boson fluctuations with a variety of spectral properties can be\ntreated within the framework of the spin-boson model [17]. Note, however, that the\nprecise sources of 1/f -type noise have yet to be identified and that the spin-boson\nformalism ceases to be valid in the limit of strong coupling to environmental fluctuators\n[18]. Moreover, the influence of noise on N > 2 coupled Josephson qubits remains\nlargely unexplored [19]. In relation to quantum information processing, it is important\nto characterise the necessary conditions for preserving coherence in a noisy environment\nbefore further steps can be taken in the direction of designing error correction schemes\nand (subsequently) fault tolerant superconducting architectures.\nIn this paper we formulate an initial model for Josephson-qubit chains in realistic\nenvironments, taking into account the most common sources of noise. First we analyse\nthe quantum dynamics in ideal conditions and then discuss the modifications one should\nexpect when (i) disorder is taken into account and (ii) the system couples linearly to an\nenvironment that is modelled as a bath of harmonic oscillators, as detailed in section 4.\nTo corroborate our view that the findings for shorter chains are generic, we also perform\nsimulations for longer chains with N \u223c 50 qubits. The simulations are performed\n\n\fEntanglement dynamics in chains of qubits with noise and disorder\n\n3\n\nusing a time-dependent Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) technique [20],\nemploying a code previously developed and tested in [21]. Given that our interest focuses\non the study of quantum coherence, the system dynamics is characterized in terms of\nentanglement creation as well as entanglement propagation along the chain. There is\ncurrently no unique way to quantify entanglement in mixed states (see Reference [22]\nfor a recent review). We choose the logarithmic negativity [23, 22] largely for its ease in\ncomputation and the availability of an operational interpretation [24]. It is defined as\nEN (\u03c1i,j ) \u2261 log2 ||\u03c1Ti,ji || ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ||.|| denotes the trace norm of a matrix and \u03c1Ti,ji is the partial transpose of the\nreduced density matrix \u03c1i,j for two subsystems i, j. Other measures would give broadly\nequivalent results [22].\nAnother fundamental problem concerns the development of techniques that allow\nfor the detection and quantification of the entanglement that is present in a network\nof qubits. Exciting experimental progress in this direction for the case of Josephson\nqubits has been reported very recently [25], whereby the entanglement was demonstrated\nvia full state tomography. As the latter is a costly and time consuming experimental\ntechnique, strategies aimed at establishing a lower bound on entanglement by means of\ndetermining spin-spin correlations have been developed [26]. We test the performance of\nthese concepts in the present case and find that, using some optimisation, they provide\nvery accurate estimates for the amount of entanglement present in the system.\n2. Entanglement Dynamics under Ideal Conditions\nWe consider an open chain of N qubits with nearest-neighbour interactions.\nHamiltonian of the system is\nHS = \u2212\n\nN\n\u22121\n1 NX\n1X\nz\n(\u01ebi \u03c3iz + \u2206i \u03c3ix ) \u2212\nKi \u03c3iz \u2297 \u03c3i+1\n2 i=1\n2 i=1\n\nThe\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c3ix,y,z denote Pauli matrices for qubit i, and Ki is the strength of the coupling\nbetween nearest neighbours i, i + 1 (we set h\u0304 = kB = 1 throughout). The control\nparameters are the energy bias \u01ebi and the tunnelling splitting \u2206i . We consider, as an\nexample, charge qubits [3], in which case we have \u01ebi = 4EC (1\u22122Ng ) and \u2206i = EJ , where\nEC is the charging energy, EJ is the Josephson energy, and 2eNg = Cg Vg is the gate\ncharge, which is controlled by the gate capacitance Cg and voltage Vg . Charge qubits are\noperated in the regime where EC \u226b EJ ; therefore the energy scale is set by EC , which\nwas of the order of 1 K in the experiment of Reference [4], and we let EJ /EC = 0.1.\nWe consider purely capacitive coupling between the charge qubits [9], and hence the\nz\n\u03c3iz \u2297 \u03c3i+1\ninteraction dominates. We assume (this condition will be relaxed later on)\nthat the effective charge number of each qubit is Ng = 1/2 (i.e., \u01ebi = 0) so that it is\noperated at the so-called degeneracy point [7]. As it will become clear later, this choice\ncan be advantageous when trying to minimise the impact of noise.\n\n\fEntanglement dynamics in chains of qubits with noise and disorder\n\n4\n\nA feasible way to achieve generation of entanglement in coupled many-body systems\nis non-adiabatic switching of interactions as demonstrated in harmonic chains [27, 28].\nThis approach has the advantage of only requiring moderate control over the parameters\nof individual subsystems. In our study here we will quantify the amount of entanglement\nthat can be obtained in this way for the model Equation (2). In particular, we will\nassume that the interqubit couplings Ki are initially zero and are then non-adiabatically\nswitched to a finite value. If one were indeed able to switch off the interqubit couplings\ncompletely, then at absolute zero temperature each qubit would be prepared in its\nground state |+i (when operated at its optimal point, where \u01ebi = 0). The ground state\nof the Hamiltonian of Equation (2) for Ki = 0 is the uncorrelated state\n1\n(3)\n|\u03a8(0)i = |+i\u2297N ,\n|+i = \u221a (| \u2191i + | \u2193i)\n2\nwhere | \u2191i, | \u2193i denote the eigenstates of \u03c3 z corresponding to zero or one extra Cooper\npair in the superconducting box. We will thus study the generation of entanglement by\nevolving the initial state of Equation (3) according to the Hamiltonian (2) with Ki 6= 0.\nWe will also study the propagation of entanglement [13, 14, 21, 27, 28] by assuming that\nour initial state is\n1\n(4)\n|\u03a6(0)i = |\u03b2i12 \u2297 |+i\u2297N \u22122 ,\n|\u03b2i12 = \u221a (| \u2191\u2193i + | \u2193\u2191i).\n2\nIn this case, the interactions Ki are initially zero but a Bell state |\u03b2i12 has been created\nfor the first two qubits. Again, the interactions are instantaneously switched on to a\nfinite value and the evolution according to the Hamiltonian (2) with Ki 6= 0 is studied.\nThe Bell state |\u03b2i12 , shared between the first two qubits in the chain, is maximally\nentangled. We note that there is also entanglement generation while the quantum\ncorrelations of |\u03b2i12 propagate along the chain. We discuss below the effect of deviations\nin these initial conditions, due to non-vanishing initial interactions or static disorder.\nWe begin by calculating the time-evolution of the logarithmic negativity of Equation\n(1) for qubit pairs in ideal conditions. In Figure 1 we show the result for a chain of N = 8\nqubits with the initial state |\u03a8(0)i of Equation (3) and parameters \u01ebi = 0, Ki = \u2206i /4.\nDue to the geometry of the setup, symmetric pairs of qubits, such as (1, 2) and\n(7, 8) possess the same amount of entanglement. It is possible to create long-range\nentanglement, even between the first and last qubit in the chain (at t \u223c 200 EC\u22121\nwhich corresponds to about 1.5 ns). By comparing and contrasting the four panels in\nFigure 1 we can see that there is a characteristic 'collapse-and-revival' behaviour: when\nthe entanglement of nearest or next-nearest neighbours is constant or vanishing, the\nentanglement of distant qubits becomes maximal (e.g., at t \u223c 200 EC\u22121 ). Due to the\nfinite length of the chain we find that neither the time when a pair of qubits becomes\nentangled for the first time, nor the time when the first entanglement maximum occurs,\nare proportional to the distance between the qubits. The characteristic speed at which\nthe distance of pairwise entanglement is expected to grow is thus masked by finite size\neffects, in our study. Entanglement propagation for this chain in ideal conditions is\nconsidered later (cf. Figure 5).\n\n\fEntanglement dynamics in chains of qubits with noise and disorder\n\n5\n\nDeviations in initial conditions: In practice, it is not quite possible to switch off\nthe interqubit couplings completely. To take this into account we have considered the\ncase when there is initially some small coupling between the qubits, Kini , and the initial\nstate of the system is the ground state of HS (Kini ). Then the ground state evolves\naccording to HS (Kfin ), where Kfin = \u2206/4. In this case we obtain very similar results\nwith those presented in Figure 1 for the ideal case (clearly, for Kini \u2192 0 we recover the\nresults of the ideal case). In particular, for Kini \u2264 \u2206/100 the relative maxima deviate\nby less than 5%, and there is initially very little entanglement in the system (e.g., the\nlogarithmic negativity for the first two qubits in the chain at t = 0 is less than 0.004).\nBy contrast, for Kini \u223c \u2206/10 the relative maxima can deviate by up to 30% and the\ninitial entanglement in the chain is much more evident (e.g., EN (\u03c11,2 ) \u223c 0.1 at t = 0\nfor the same parameters). We will revisit this case shortly, after we have introduced\ndisorder and noise into the system (cf. Figure 4).\nAnother interesting question relating to the initial preparation concerns the state of\nthe chain at thermal equilibrium. In particular, we would like to know if we would obtain\nsimilar results when the state of the system at t = 0 is the thermal equilibrium state,\nand also how close are the thermal and ground states of the system described by the\nHamiltonian HS (Kini ) of Equation (2). We have therefore assumed that the initial state\nof the chain is the thermal equilibrium state \u03c1(T ) = exp(\u2212\u03b2HS )/Z, where \u03b2 = 1/T ,\nZ = Tr[exp(\u2212\u03b2HS )], and there is initial coupling, Kini , between the qubits. The coupling\nis then switched on to its final value Kfin at t = 0. In this case we have found that for\nlow temperatures (T \u2264 20 mK) the entanglement dynamics of the chain is very similar\nwith that obtained by evolving the ground state (the relative deviations are less than\n10%) for the same value of Kini . In order to compare the thermal equilibrium state\n\u03c1(T ) with the ground state |Gi of HS (Kini ) we have calculated the fidelity hG|\u03c1(T )|Gi\nfor various values of the temperature (with fixed Kini = \u2206/4). We have found that for\ntemperatures T \u2264 15 mK the fidelity is between 0.99 and 1, and hence the two states\nare very close indeed for these temperatures. Between 15 mK and 25 mK the thermal\nequilibrium state and the ground state begin to differ (their fidelity slowly drops to 0.9\nas the temperature is increased).\n3. Influence of Disorder\nIn any experimental situation the initial preparation will also suffer from errors in the\ncontrol parameters \u03b1ctrl = \u01ebi , \u2206i , Ki . As a result, the homogeneity of the chain will\nbe broken. We can simulate the effect by letting the parameters take random, but\nstatic, values in the interval [(1 \u2212 d)\u03b1ctrl , (1 + d)\u03b1ctrl ], where d quantifies the disorder.\nAn example is shown in Figure 2(a), where we plot EN (t) for the pair (1, 2) in the\nideal (solid line) and imperfect scenario (broken line), where the disorder in \u2206i and\nKi is d = 0.05. Averaging over 104 runs, we have found that disorder with d = 0.01,\nd = 0.05, and d = 0.10 causes relative fluctuations of the maximal entanglement equal\nto 0.011, 0.027 and 0.054, respectively. Therefore for disorder which is less than 10%\n\n\f6\n\nEntanglement dynamics in chains of qubits with noise and disorder\n\n0.3\n\n(1,2) or (7,8)\n(2,3) or (6,7)\n\n0.2\n\nN\n\nE (\u03c1\n\ni,j\n\n)\n\n(a) N = 8; K = 0.025; ideal\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n(3,4) or (5,6)\n(4,5)\n\n0.2\n\nN\n\nE (\u03c1\n\ni,j\n\n)\n\n(b)\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n(1,3) or (6,8)\n(2,4) or (5,7)\n\n0.2\n\nN\n\nE (\u03c1\n\ni,j\n\n)\n\n(c)\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n(1,4) or (5,8)\n(1,8)\n\n0.2\n\nN\n\nE (\u03c1\n\ni,j\n\n)\n\n(d)\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n\u22121\n\nt (EC )\n\nFigure 1.

This is indeed true for the noisy scenario also, as shown\nin the following section. It is noted that disorder has recently been studied in related,\nbut different, contexts in [27, 30].\n4.

We assume that the\nenvironments of all qubits are identical. We have not specified the environment's spectral\nproperties and hence the decay rate \u0393 is given as a phenomenological parameter whose\nexact value can be adjusted to match that obtained for the actual spectral density of the\nbath. Within this framework, a broad class of dissipative effects can be accounted for,\nranging from electromagnetic fluctuations in the surrounding circuitry to, for instance,\nthe coupling to a phonon bath [31]. The system can therefore be viewed as a non\ncritical dissipative Ising chain (The critical behaviour of dissipative Ising chains has\nbeen recently addressed in [32].)\nAt the degeneracy point \u01ebi = 0 and cos \u03b8i = 0. As a result, each qubit is susceptible\nto relaxation only (the 'optimal' point introduced in Reference [7]). If, however, the\nenergy bias is not exactly zero then the longitudinal contribution \u03c3iz Xi leads to pure\ndephasing at a rate gi . In any experimental realization, the presence of disorder limits\nthe accuracy with which qubits can be operated at their optimal points, especially when\nit comes to the operation of long chains. In what follows we take this into account and\nstudy the modifications due to disorder. In current experiments [29] the value of disorder\nis typically 5\u221210% at temperatures 20\u221240 mK. The decoherence time td \u2261 \u0393\u22121 for two\ncoupled charged qubits [10] was reported to be around 2.5 ns (for single qubits td can\nbe higher). In our simulations below we usually assume a worst-case scenario and let\nd = 5% at T \u2248 41 mK with decay rate \u0393 = 10\u22122 EC (which corresponds to td \u2248 1 ns).\n5. Dynamics of Short Chains (N \u223c 10 qubits)\nIn this section we discuss the results on the entanglement dynamics of open chains\nwith N = 8 qubits (Figures 1-6).

Figure 2(c) shows the creation of entanglement in the pair (1, 8) for\nvarious values of \u0393 and other parameters. It is seen that for noise strength \u0393 = 5 \u00d7 10\u22123\n(i.e., td \u2248 5 ns), average number of photons nT = 0.01 (i.e., T \u2248 22 mK) and disorder\nd = 5% one may still obtain substantial entanglement between the first and last qubit\nin the chain (in particular, the ratio of the values of the first maxima corresponding to\nthe imperfect / ideal cases is approximately 2/5).\nIn Figure 3 we plot EN (t) for different pairs of qubits in the case of (top) relaxation\nwith \u0393 = 10\u22122 at zero temperature (T = 0) and (bottom) relaxation with \u0393 = 10\u22122 ,\nfinite temperature T \u2248 41 mK (nT = 0.1) or T \u2248 33 mK (nT = 0.05), and disorder\n5% (d = 0.05). As expected, the entanglement beyond nearest neighbours is drastically\nreduced in the presence of larger values of the noise (the correlations between the first\nand last qubit in the chain vanish altogether for this high value of \u0393).\nIn Figure 4 we study the creation of entanglement between the first two qubits in\nthe chain (in subplots (a) and (b)) when the initial state is the ground state of the\nHamiltonian HS\u2032 (Kini ) of Equation (7), for various values of the initial coupling strength\nKini .

The evolution proceeds according to the master equation\n(9) with the coupling Kfin and an average number of photons nT that corresponds\nto the temperature T0 . It is seen that at operating temperatures of around 40 mK\nthe entanglement vanishes. It is however possible to observe entanglement when the\ntemperature gets smaller (e.g., for T0 \u2248 33 mK).\nThe results in Figure 4 seem to indicate that the increase in the noise strength\n\u0393 and the external temperature yield the unavoidable degrading of entanglement\ngeneration.

Steady state entanglement between qubits (1,2) in a chain of N = 4 when\nnT = 0.1 and for different values of the ratio K/\u2206 as a function of the noise strength\n\u0393. Parameter regimes can be identified where entanglement generation is enhanced by\namplifying the environmental noise.\n\nbecomes separable in the steady state for \u0393 and/or nT sufficiently large. However, this\nbehaviour is not universal and we need to differentiate two time scales in the system.\nThe initial transient is always such that the amplitude of entanglement oscillations is\nreduced as the noise increases and the amplitude of the first entanglement maximum\nis a monotonically decreasing function of both \u0393 and T . However, for a fixed nT , the\nsteady-state entanglement can display a non-monotonic behaviour as a function of \u0393.\nThis phenomenon is of the same type of the noise-assisted effects that have been studied\nin Reference [33] for weakly driven spin chains and is illustrated in Figure 5 for a system\nof N = 4 qubits. We see that at the selected temperature where nT = 0.1, there are\nparameter regimes for which the steady-state entanglement is initially zero for low values\nof the noise strength and resurfaces when \u0393 is increased over a certain threshold. This\nresult indicates that if the aim is to generate entanglement in the steady state, it may\nbe advantageous to amplify the environmental noise so as to maximise entanglement\nproduction along the chain. Persistence of this effect in longer chains (N \u223c 40) has\nbeen corroborated numerically.\nPropagation of entanglement is analysed in Figure 6 for (a) ideal and (b) nonideal conditions. In the ideal case, entanglement propagates from the first two qubits\nto the last two, but not perfectly. When we take into account noise and disorder\nthe entanglement transfer is not possible and the last two qubits quickly reach their\nsteady state, which is slightly entangled at absolute zero temperature, but separable at\nT \u223c 20 mK for the selected parameter regime.\n\n\f12\n\nEntanglement dynamics in chains of qubits with noise and disorder\n\n1\n\nEN(\u03c1i , j)\n\n(1,2)\n(2,3)\n(1,3)\n(7,8)\n\nN = 8; K = 0.025; \u0393 = 0; nT = 0; dis = 0%\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\nt\n\n1\n\n500\n\n600\n\n(1,2)\n(2,3)\n(1,3)\n(7,8)\n\nN = 8; K = 0.025; \u0393 = 0.01; nT = 0; dis = 5%\n\n0.8\nEN(\u03c1i , j)\n\n400\n\n(E\u22121\n)\nC\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\nt\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n(E\u22121\n)\nC\n\nFigure 6.

Dynamics of Long Chains\nTo confirm the validity of our findings for longer chains, we have performed timedependent DMRG simulations [20].\nFor an ideal chain without noise and disorder, we have considered entanglement\ngeneration in the model (2) with N = 20 qubits. Here the matrix dimension was chosen\ndim = 20 and a 4th order Suzuki-Trotter decomposition was employed. The results\nare in good agreement with the findings for shorter chains in figure 1. In particular, we\nobserve the same 'collapse-and-revival' pattern of the entanglement oscillations, and the\nlong-range entanglement peaks at those regions where the short-range entanglement is\nclose to its steady-state value or vanishes altogether.\nFor the cases which include noise and disorder, a matrix product representation\nfor mixed states with matrix dimension dim = 60 and a 4th order Suzuki-Trotter\ndecomposition were used for a chain of N = 40 qubits [20]. A sketch of the method is\ngiven in Appendix A.\nFigure 7 shows the creation of entanglement in the presence of noise, at zero\ntemperature for both a homogeneous and a disordered chain (in which case disorder\noccurs in \u01ebi as well as \u2206i , Ki ). Figure 8 shows entanglement creation in a noisy\n\n\f13\n\nEntanglement dynamics in chains of qubits with noise and disorder\nN = 40; K = 0.025; \u0393= 0.01; nT = 0; dis = 5%\n\nN = 40; K = 0.025; \u0393= 0.01; nT = 0; dis = 0%\n\n(1,2)\n\n(1,2)\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n(1,3)\n\n(1,3)\n0.2\n(1,4)\n\nEN(\u03c1i,j)\n\nEN(\u03c1i,j)\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n(1,4)\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nt\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n(E\u22121\n)\nC\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n200\n\n(20,21)\n\n(20,21)\n0.25\n\n0.25\n(20,22)\n\n(20,22)\n0.2\n\n0.2\n(20,23)\n\nEN(\u03c1i,j)\n\nEN(\u03c1i,j)\n\n180\n\nN = 40; K = 0.025; \u0393= 0.01; nT = 0; dis = 5%\n\nN = 40; K = 0.025; \u0393= 0.01; nT = 0; dis=0%\n\n0.15\n\n(20,23)\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0\n0\n\n160\n\nt (E\u22121\n)\nC\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nt\n\n(E\u22121\n)\nC\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n\u22121\n\nt (EC )\n\nFigure 7.

Qubits at the boundaries\nare slightly stronger entangled than in the centre of the chain. The entanglement\nbetween qubits that are further apart than shown here is zero.\n\nhomogeneous chain for various values of temperature. For all quantities we find good\nagreement with the results obtained for N = 8, where the relative deviations between\nN = 40 and N = 8 are less than 5%. It is also noted that the entanglement between\ntwo blocks of two qubits each was found to be about 17% higher than the entanglement\nbetween individual qubits of the same separation.\n7. Witnessing Quantum Correlations: Experimental Verification of\nEntanglement\nIn experiments it will be crucial to verify the existence of entanglement via\nmeasurements, which ideally should also permit a quantification of the detected\nentanglement. This could be done by full state tomography, which is a very costly\nexperimental procedure though. Being able to establish a lower bound on entanglement\nfrom the measurement of a few observables will thus be a significant advantage. Recently,\na theoretical framework for the exploration of these questions has been developed for\ngeneral observables [26] and witness operators [34].\nThe basic approach is to identify the least entangled quantum state that is\n\n\f14\n\nEntanglement dynamics in chains of qubits with noise and disorder\n0.25\n\nN = 40; K = 0.025; \u0393= 0.01; dis=0%\n\nn = 0.05\nT\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\nnT = 0.2\n\nN\n\nE (\u03c1\n\n1,2\n\n)\n\nnT = 0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n\u22121\nt(E )\nC\n\nFigure 8.

Only nearest neighbours become\nentangled in this case.\n\ncompatible with the measurement data. The entanglement of that state then provides a\nquantitative value for the entanglement that can be guaranteed given the measurement\ndata. In [26], in particular, spin-spin correlations have been used to determine such a\nlower bound analytically. We now employ this concept for our system and consider the\ntwo quantities,\nh\n\n\u0010\n\nxx\nzz\n| + |Ci,j\n|\nC1 (\u03c1i,j ) \u2261 max 0, log2 |Ci,j\n\nh\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011i\n\n(12)\n\u0011\n\nyy\nxx\nzz\n| + |Ci,j\n| + |Ci,j\n| \u22121\nC2 (\u03c1i,j ) \u2261 max 0, log2 1 + |Ci,j\n\ni\n\n(13)\n\nab\nwhere Ci,j\n= Tr[\u03c3ia \u03c3jb \u03c1] (a, b = x, y, z). Both quantities form a lower bound to the\nlogarithmic negativity, i.e. EN (\u03c1i,j ) \u2265 C1 (\u03c1i,j ) and EN (\u03c1i,j ) \u2265 C2 (\u03c1i,j ). C1 (\u03c1i,j ) can be\nyy\nxx\nzz\nemployed if only Ci,j\nand Ci,j\nare accessible in measurements. However, if Ci,j\ncan be\nmeasured too, then C2 (\u03c1i,j ) yields a tighter bound.\nFigure 9 shows that both lower bounds provide good approximations for the\nlogarithmic negativity of two neighbouring qubits. If the qubits are next-nearest\nneighbours, C2 (\u03c1i,j ) still provides a good estimate, while C1 (\u03c1i,j ) eventually fails to\napproximate the entanglement well.\nThe reason why C1 (\u03c1i,j ) and C2 (\u03c1i,j ) sometimes do not approximate the\nentanglement very well lies in the choices of the axes along which correlations are\nyy\nxx\nzz\nmeasured. Instead of Ci,j\n, Ci,j\nand Ci,j\none could consider correlations along a rotated\nP\naa\nbb\ncc\nset of axes, Ci,j , Ci,j and Ci,j , where \u03c3ia = \u03b1=x,y,z Ra\u03b1 \u03c3i\u03b1 and Ra\u03b1 is an orthogonal\nmatrix representing the rotation. Choosing to measure correlations along x, y and z\nmay hence underestimate the entanglement severely. The best approximation of the\naa\nbb\ncc\nentanglement is obtained by maximising Ci,j\n, Ci,j\nand Ci,j\nover all possible choices for\n\n\f15\n\nEntanglement dynamics in chains of qubits with noise and disorder\n0.25\nE (\u03c1\nN\n\n)\n\n10,11\n\nC1(\u03c110,11)\n\n0.2\n\nC (\u03c1\n2\n\n)\n\n10,11\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n\u22121\nC\n\nt (E )\n\nFigure 9.

While C2 (\u03c110,11 ) = 0.1583 at this point, we obtained\nC2\u2032 (\u03c110,11 ) = 0.2096 for the optimal choice of axes a, b and c. The optimal choice of axes\ndepends on time. Yet one fixed set of axes approximated the entanglement very well\nover a range of \u2206t = 5EC\u22121 in our example.\n8. Conclusions\nWe have studied the dynamics of entanglement in qubit chains influenced by noise\nand static disorder. This study provides useful analysis for interesting experiments\nP\nP\n\u2021 According to theorem VIII.3.9 of [35], for a square matrix X, i |Xii | \u2264 i |\u03bbi |, where the \u03bbi are the\nP\neigenvalues of X. As i |\u03bbi | is a unitarily invariant matrix norm, it does not depend on the choice of\nP\nP\nP\nbasis while i |Xii | does. Thus the largest value that can be achieved for i |Xii | is given by i |\u03bbi |.\n\n\fEntanglement dynamics in chains of qubits with noise and disorder\n\n16\n\nwith quantum devices that in the long term may be suitable for the implementation of\nquantum computing. We have considered an experimentally interesting implementation\nusing Josephson charge qubits with capacitive interactions between nearest neighbours.\nWe have found that static disorder less than 10% (i.e., the current experimental upper\nbound) does not affect the entanglement dynamics substantially. By contrast, the\ninfluence of environmental noise, modelled here as a set of independent harmonic\noscillator baths of arbitrary spectral density, is much more pronounced: it reduces longrange correlations and decreases the magnitude of the achievable bipartite entanglement.\nFor typical operating temperatures, the influence of noise on the chain dynamics at\nshort times and in the steady-state can be crucially distinct; while the entanglement\namplitudes in the initial transient decrease monotonically with the noise strength, the\nsteady-state response is non-monotonic. Therefore, we have identified parameter regimes\nin which the bipartite entanglement increases as a result of amplifying the noise. We\nhave found agreement between the behaviour of entanglement in short (N \u223c 10) and\nlong (N \u223c 50) chains.\nThe present results are encouraging from the experimental point of view as\nthey suggest that (a) both short- and long-range entanglement can be generated and\npropagated under suitable laboratory conditions, and (b) lower bounds can be placed\non the entanglement from the measurement of a few general observables.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Rosario Fazio, Hans Mooij and Phil Meeson for stimulating\ndiscussions.

Matrix Product State Simulations for Mixed States\nHere we outline the concept proposed in [20] and its adaption to our application. For\nthe Matrix Product State simulation of mixed state dynamics, the density matrix for N\nqubits is expanded in a basis of matrices formed by direct products of the elementary\nmatrices\n\u01eb1 =\n\n1 0\n0 0\n\n!\n\n\u01eb3 =\n\n0 0\n1 0\n\n!\n\n;\n;\n\n\u01eb2 =\n\n0 1\n0 0\n\n!\n\n;\n\n(A.1)\n\n\u01eb4 =\n\n0 0\n0 1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(A.2)\n\nHence the matrices forming the basis for N qubits are of the form\n\u01ebi \u2297 \u01ebj \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u01ebl .\n\n|\n\n{z\n\nN sites\n\n}\n\n(A.3)\n\n\fEntanglement dynamics in chains of qubits with noise and disorder\n\n17\n\nThe expansion of the density matrix \u03c1 is now written in terms of products of matrices\nin the following way:\n\u03c1=\n\n4\nX\n\ns1 ,s2 ,...sN =1\n\n[s ]\n\n[s ]\n\n[s ]\n\n\u03931 1 * \u039b1 * \u03932 2 * \u039b2 * . . . * \u039bN \u22121 * \u0393NN \u01ebs1 \u2297 \u01ebs2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u01ebsN\n\n(A.4)\n\n[s ]\n\nwhere '*' denotes matrix multiplication. Here, each \u03931 1 (s1 = 1, 2, 3, 4) is a row vector\n[s ]\n[s ]\nof length D, each \u0393NN is a column vector of length D, each \u0393j j (j 6= 1, N) is a D \u00d7 D\nmatrix and each \u039bj is a diagonal D \u00d7 D matrix. The structure of the matrices \u0393 and\n\u039b is the same as in the Matrix Product representation of pure states and the TEBDalgorithm [20] can be employed for the simulation of the dynamics. In contrast to\npure states, the matrix elements of the \u039bj for mixed states can however no longer be\ninterpreted as the Schmidt coefficients of the respective decomposition.\nReferences\n[1] A.J.
