We propose intracluster supernova as a possible source, and also predict the supernova rate in\nintracluster space as a critical test.\nKey words: galaxies: clusters: general - (galaxies:) intergalactic medium - (stars:) supernovae:\ngeneral -\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nClusters of galaxies are the largest virialized systems\nin the universe, and their importance as a cosmological\nprobe is well-recognized. If shock heating from gravitational collapse is the dominant mechanism driving intracluster medium evolution, the self-similar model (e.g.,\nKaiser 1986) is a natural expectation. Based on the selfsimilar model, we can discuss the statistical properties of\nclusters of galaxies, and most of the observational results\n(for example, temperature function and mass \u2013 temperature relation) can be well explained. However, some observational results are inconsistent with the self-similar\nmodel (e.g., Evrard, Henry 1991; Kaiser 1991). One of\nthem is the luminosity \u2013 temperature (L\u2013T ) relation. In\nthe self-similar model, the X-ray luminosity, LX , can be\n2\n2\n(1 + zvir ) T 2 , where zvir is the\nexpressed as LX \u221d fgas\nredshift of cluster virialization, fgas is the gas mass fraction, and T is the temperature. This expression shows\nthat if all clusters are formed at the same redshift with\nthe same gas mass fraction, the X-ray luminosity would\nbe proportional to the temperature squared. In fact, this\nrelation is significantly steeper than that observed (e.g.,\nDavid et al. 1993).\nIn order to explain the L\u2013T relation, we need some\nphysical processes that can break the self-similar scaling.\nExtra energy input is the most likely physical process\n(e.g., Evrard, Henry 1991; Kaiser 1991). Much literature\nhas discussed cluster properties based on this consideration, and shows that extra energy of 0.1 \u2013 1 keV/particle\nis required to explain the L \u2013 T relation.\nAs a source of extra energy, supernovae (SNe) and\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising. First, we\nbriefly consider SNe. The available energy from a supernova is \u01eb \u00d7 1051 erg, where \u01eb is the conversion factor\nfrom the SN kinetic energy to the thermal energy of the\n\nintracluster gas. Assuming 1 supernova event per 100\nM\u2299 of stars formed, the total available energy is roughly\nexpressed as 1051 \u01eb (Mgal /100M\u2299) erg, where Mgal is the\ntotal mass of the stars in galaxies. We then obtain the\nextra energy per particle as 0.7 \u01eb [(Mgal /Mgas )/0.2] keV,\nwhere Mgas is the mass of intracluster gas. Here, we\nadopt Mgal /Mgas = 0.2 as a typical value. If \u01eb is on\nthe order of 1, the L\u2013T relation can be explained by the\nenergy input from SNe. However, it is a serious problem that \u01eb is on the order of 1, since most of the SN\nkinetic energy converts to radiation energy. For example, Thornton et al. (1998) have shown that about 90%\nof the SN kinetic energy is lost by radiation in galaxies, that is, \u01eb < 0.1. Thus, it is difficult for SNe to\nbe the energy source. Although AGNs (jets or winds)\nare another candidate, their energy conversion efficiency\nis very uncertain. Therefore, the energy source has not\nbeen identified.\nIn this paper, we reconsider SN as an energy source\nwhile exploring the possibility that they occur in intracluster space.\n2.\n\nIntracluster Supernovae\n\nFor considering SNe as an energy source, the radiative\nenergy loss is the core of the problem. To resolve this,\nthe SN kinetic energy must convert to thermal energy\nbefore radiative cooling becomes efficient. This is possible if a SN occurs in a low-density environment, i.e. in\nintracluster space, since the radiative energy loss rate is\nproportional to the density squared. According to Thornton et al. (1998), radiative cooling begins to be efficient\nat 1.4 \u00d7 106 yr from a SN explosion, with the surrounding gas density and temperature being 10\u22123 cm\u22123 and\n1000 K, respectively. Until this epoch, we can use the\n\n\f2\n\nS. Sasaki\n\nSedov\u2013Taylor model and find that the shock velocity is\nabout 100 km s\u22121 at t = 1.4 \u00d7 106 yr (Thornton et al.\n1998). This corresponds to the sound velocity of gas with\nT \u223c 105 K. Thus, if the temperature of the surrounding\ngas is higher than 105 K, then all of the SN kinetic energy\nwould convert to thermal energy without any radiative\nloss.\nThat is to say, the problem is whether sufficient SN\nexplosions occur in intracluster space. First of all, we\nconsider how many stars there are in intracluster space.\nTheoretically, as a consequence of the stripping of stars\nfrom galaxies in clusters through the effect of fast encounters with other galaxies (e.g. Moore et al. 1996)\nand the interaction of the galaxies with the tidal field\nof the cluster, itself, the existence of an intracluster star\nhas been expected (e.g., Dressler 1984). This idea is supported by observations: for example, Gregg and West\n(1998) reported on optical features explained as tidal debris generated during galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-cluster\ninteractions in the Coma cluster. N-body simulations\npredict that the fraction of mass in the intracluster stars\nto the total cluster stars is greater than 10% (e.g., Miller\n1983).\nObservationally, evidence of intracluster stars also exists. Although Zwicky (1951) first claimed to detect excess light between the galaxies of the Coma cluster, subsequent searches have not been conclusive. Recently we\nhave obtained more direct evidence. First, many intracluster planetary nebulae have been found in the Virgo\ncluster (Feldmeier et al. 1998) and the Fornax cluster\n(Theuns, Warren 1997). Second, Ferguson et al. (1998)\nhave reported on intracluster red-giant-branch stars in\nthe Virgo cluster using the HST. The estimated fraction\nof intracluster stars to the total number of cluster stars\nis very uncertain. It varies from 10% to 80%, depending\non the literature. Here, we adopt a fraction of 50% as a\ntypical value; that is, the number of stars in intracluster\nspace is roughly equivalent to that in galaxies.\nWe can then estimate the extra energy by intracluster\nSNe by assuming the same SN rate as that given above.\nWe obtain\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nMgal /Mgas\nMIC,\u2217 /Mgal\nkeV/particle,(1)\n0.7\u01eb\n1\n0.2\nwhere MIC,\u2217 is the total mass of the intracluster stars.\nConsidering intracluster stars stripped from galaxies by\ngalaxy\u2013galaxy and galaxy\u2013cluster interactions, massive\nobjects like groups of galaxies may have already been\nformed when intracluster SNe explode. It is then likely\nthat the temperature of the surrounding gas is higher\nthan 105 K. Thus, from the above discussion, the energy\nconversion efficiency, \u01eb, is on the order of 1. Excess energy\nby intracluster SNe becomes \u223c 0.7 keV / particle. It is\nnoted that this value is the same as that in the case of\nSNe in galaxies, when assuming no radiative loss.\n\n3.\n\n[Vol. ,\nDiscussion\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed intracluster SNe.\nThe most uncertain point is the assumption that the SN\nrate in intracluster space is the same as that in galaxies. This depends on what morphological type galaxies\nmainly release their stars to intracluster space by stripping. In nearby clusters, most interacting galaxies are of\nthe late type. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that\nstripped stars are relatively young and that the SN rate\nin intracluster space is the same as that in galaxies.\nIn order to study the effect of intracluster SNe on the\ncluster properties quantitatively, we need to perform numerical calculations. As shown in the above estimation,\nthe excess energy by intracluster SNe is equivalent to\nthat by SNe in galaxies, when assuming no radiative\nloss, which may be incorrect. Thus, under the assumption that the SN rate in intracluster space is the same as\nthat in galaxies, it is expected that the intracluster SNe\naffect such cluster properties as those in galaxies when\nassuming no radiative loss. We can then use the previous results, which consider the cluster properties with\nextra energy by SNe in galaxies without radiative loss as\na good approximation for this case. For example, Wu\net al. (1998) studied the effect of extra energy by SNe\non the L\u2013T relation and other properties using a semianalytic model. Their main result is that one can fit\nthe L\u2013T relation and others by including extra energies\nof \u223c 1 keV/particle. It is very possible that intracluster SNe can release such energy as that discussed above.\nThus, intracluster SNe can be the source of extra energy\nin clusters.\nIn order to confirm that intracluster SNe are in fact the\nextra energy source, we need to consider some points. If\nintracluster SNe are the extra energy source, they would\neject much metal into intracluster space. However, it has\nbeen considered that the metal in the intracluster gas is\nsupplied from elliptical/S0 galaxies based on the correlation between the iron mass, Miron , and the optical luminosities in elliptical/S0 galaxies, LE+S0 (e.g., Arnaud et\nal. 1992). Although the origin of galaxy morphology remains an unsettled problem, galaxy interactions, such as\nmergers, may be important processes in elliptical-galaxy\nformation. If so, it is expected that there would be a\npositive correlation between the total mass of elliptical\ngalaxies and that of intracluster stars, since both elliptical galaxies and intracluster stars are formed through\ngalaxy interactions. Thus, qualitatively, the observed\ncorrelation between Miron and LE+S0 does not contradict\nthis paper's scenario. On the other hand, some literature\nclaim that the required energy to explain the L\u2013T relation is larger than \u223c 1 keV/particle, 2 \u2013 3.5 keV/particle,\ndepending on the epoch of energy input, the source distribution and so on (e.g., Wu et al. 1999; Loewenstein\n2000). If their result is correct, the energy input from\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nIntracluster Supernova as a Possible Extra Energy Source of Clusters\n\nintracluster SNe would explain only part of the required\nenergy, and other energy sources could be needed. In\norder to study these points and obtain to quantitative\nresults, we now wish to undertake a detailed study using\na semi-analytic model.\nAt the present, the fraction of the intracluster stars\nto the total cluster stars, which is an important value in\nthis paper's scenario, is very uncertain. If the fraction\nis much smaller than \u223c 50%, intracluster SNe cannot\nrelease the required energy to explain the L\u2013T relation,\nand other energy sources are needed. The main reason\nfor this uncertainty is that the total area of the observed\nfields is small. If future surveys obtain more precise values, we could judge clearly whether intracluster SNe are\nan extra energy source or not.\nUntil now, no SN has been discovered in intracluster\nspace. If stripping occurs only at a high redshift, typeII SNe in intracluster space would also occur only at a\nhigh redshift. Thus, we do not observe them in intracluster space at the present. However, it is expected\nthat type-Ia SNe occur, even at present. Using the typeIa SN rate in elliptical galaxies [0.98h2 /(1010 LB 100 yr),\nvan den Bergh, Tammann 1991] and assuming a mass-toluminosity ratio of 5, typical for the stellar content of an\nold population, the type-Ia SN rate in intracluster space\nis\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0015\u22121\n\u0012\nMIC,\u2217\nM/L\nh\nyr\u22121 ,(2)\n0.08\n0.65\n1013 M\u2299\n5(M/L)\u2299\nwhere H0 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 is the Hubble constant.\nIn rich clusters, like the Coma cluster, a type-Ia SN occurs every ten years. This is a crucial test of the scenario\nthat intracluster SNe are the extra energy source.\nWe would like to thank an anonymous referee for\nhis/her useful comments and suggestions.
