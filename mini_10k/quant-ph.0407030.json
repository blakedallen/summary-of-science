Two experiments for testing this quantum state are proposed.\nPACS: 03.65.Ud, 42.50.Dv\nKeywords: entangled photon pair, entangled quantum states, quantum\nnon-locality\n\n1\n\nintroduction\n\nQuantum non-locality is a controversial topic of quantum theory, and entangled\nphoton pairs played a very important role in experimental tests of quantum nonlocality. So far, a number of experimental tests of quantum non-locality based\non Bell's theorem [1] have been carried out [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In these experiments\nentangled photon pairs are produced, and the polarization correlation between\nentangled photon pairs is measured. Experimental results obtained in these tests\nare in favor for quantum non-locality. Although it has been pointed out that\nthis polarization correlation is compatible with local realism [7], these results\nare generally considered as direct evidences for the existence of quantum nonlocality, and more experiments [8, 9, 10] showing different kind of quantum\nnon-local correlation are carried out. The entangled photon pairs are used as\nlight source in these experiments, and the interpretation of the experimental\nresults as proofs for quantum non-locality is closely related to the assumption\nthat these photon pairs are in entangled quantum state.\nIn this letter, I will show that the same polarization correlation also exists\nfor certain un-entangled photon pairs. And on other hand, based on the consideration of momentum conservation, I will also show that the entangled quantum\nstate is not a correct description for photon pairs used in these experimental\ntests of quantum non-locality. A correct quantum state for these photon pairs is\nsuggested, and two experiments for testing this quantum state and the quantum\nnon-locality are proposed.\n1\n\n\f2\n\npolarization correlation between un-entangled\nphotons\n\nLet's consider a beam of un-entangled photon pairs with each photon pair containing a left circle polarized photon and a right circle polarized photon. Such\na beam of photon pairs can be produced by adjusting polarization state of\nthe photon pairs obtained from the parametric down conversion with a type-II\ncollinear phase matching [11]. The quantum state of this un-entangled photon\npairs can be expressed as\n|\u03c8i =\n\n1\n1 \u2020\n(bv + ib\u2020h )(b\u2020v \u2212 ib\u2020h )|0i = (b\u2020v b\u2020v + b\u2020h b\u2020h )|0i,\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere b\u2020v and b\u2020h are the creation operator for vertically polarized photon and,\nrespectively, for horizontally polarized photon with the wave vector ~k2 . By using\nthe Coulomb gauge, we may describe the optical field of these photon pairs by\n~ The positive frequencies part of the vector potential is\nthe vector potential A.\nrelated to the photon annihilation operators in the following way\n~ + = B(bv ~ev + bh~eh )ei~k2 *~r\nA\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the constant B is given by [12]\nB=\n\nr\n\n\u03bc0 ~c2\n2V \u03c9\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03bc0 the magnetic permeability of the vacuum, \u03c9 the angular frequency of\nthe photons.\nWe divide the beam of un-entangled photon pairs into two channels by using\na half reflecting mirror (BS). The wave vectors of photons in these two channels\nare ~k1 and ~k2 . A half wave plate (W P1 ) is placed into the channel 1 to introduce\na phase difference of \u03c0 between the vertical and horizontal components of the\noptical field, and another half wave plate (W P2 ) is placed into the channel 2\nto swap the vertical and horizontal components of the optical field, as shown\nin FIG. 1. As no incident photons with the wave vector ~k1 being present, after\npassing the beam splitter and the wave plates, the optical field becomes [13]\nB\nB\n~\n~\n~+ = \u221a\nA\n(bv ~ev \u2212 bh~eh )eik1 *~r + \u221a (bh~ev + bv ~eh )eik2 *~r .\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nThe photons in the channel 1 and 2 are polarized by Glan-Thompsom linear\npolarization analyzers P1 and P2 , respectively, before being detected by single\nphoton detectors D1 and D2 .\nTo analyze the polarization correlation between photons detected by detectors D1 and D2 , we need expressions of optical field at these detectors. Up to\na phase factor, we have\nB\n~+ = \u221a\nA\n(bv cos \u03b81 \u2212 bh sin \u03b81 )~e\u03b81\n\u03b81\n2\n2\n\n(5)\n\n\fD1\n\n1\n\n1 \u2020 \u2020 \u2020 \u2020\n( bh bh + bv bv ) 0\n2\n\n2\n1\n2\n\n\u03b81\n\nWP1\n1\n\nP1\n\n\u03b82\n\n1\n\nBS\n\n2\n\n2\nWP2\n\n1\n2\n\n2\n1\n\nP2\n\nD2\n\nFigure 1: A schematic illustration of the experimental setup for testing the\npolarization correlation between un-entangled photon pairs.

The relations (5) and (6) can be\nrewritten in the following form\nB\nB\n~+ = \u221a\n~+ = \u221a\nb\u03b81 ~e\u03b81 , A\nb\u03b82 ~e\u03b82\nA\n\u03b82\n\u03b81\n2\n2\n\n(7)\n\nb\u03b81 = bv cos \u03b81 \u2212 bh sin \u03b81 , b\u03b82 = bh cos \u03b82 + bv sin \u03b82\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\nare the annihilation operators for the photon polarized in the direction ~e\u03b81 with\nthe wave vector ~k1 and, respectively, for the photon polarized in the direction\n~e\u03b82 with the wave vector ~k2 .\nThe coincidence counting rate C(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) is proportional to the probability\nof annihilating simultaneously one photon polarized in the direction ~e\u03b81 at the\ndetector D1 and one photon polarized in the direction ~e\u03b82 at the detector D2 .\nThis probability is, in its turn, proportional the matrix element\nh\u03c8|b\u2020\u03b82 b\u2020\u03b81 b\u03b81 b\u03b82 |\u03c8i = h\u03c8|(b\u2020v cos \u03b81 \u2212 b\u2020h sin \u03b81 )(b\u2020h cos \u03b82 + b\u2020v sin \u03b82 )\n\n\u00d7 (bv cos \u03b81 \u2212 bh sin \u03b81 )(bh cos \u03b82 + bv sin \u03b82 )|\u03c8i\n1\n= sin2 (\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 ).\n4\n\n(9)\n\nTherefore we have\nC(\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) = CM sin2 (\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 ),\n3\n\n(10)\n\n\fwhere CM this the maxim counting rate that occurs at \u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 = \u00b1\u03c0/2. This\ncorrelation is just the same as in the case of entangled photon pairs [6, 11], and\nthe Bell's inequality is apparently violated also in the above discussed experiment. The violation of the Bell's inequality in this case is only apparent, because\na condition for obtaining the Bell's inequality is not fulfilled here. Namely, in\nthe experiment described in this paper, both photons of a photon pair could\nbe detected in one single channel, with the wave vector ~k1 or ~k2 . Thus, even\nthough the same polarization correlation as in the case of entangled photon\npairs is realized in this experiment, no quantum non-locality is involved here.\nIndeed, after annihilating of a linear polarized photon at the detector D1 , the\nquantum state becomes\n1\n|\u03c8 \u2032 i = b\u03b81 |\u03c8i = \u221a (cos \u03b81 b\u2020v \u2212 sin \u03b81 b\u2020h )|0i.\n2\n\n(11)\n\nThe photon in the quantum state |\u03c8 \u2032 i is not spatially separated from the detector\nD1 where another photon was annihilated. The probability as the photon in\nthe quantum state |\u03c8 \u2032 i being detected at D1 is\nh\u03c8 \u2032 |b\u2020\u03b81 b\u03b81 |\u03c8 \u2032 i =\n\n3\n\n1\n.\n2\n\n(12)\n\nquantum state of entangled photon pairs\n\nNow we arrive at a very important point: the observation of a photon polarization correlation as expressed in the relation (10) does not form a sufficient\nevidence for quantum non-locality. Besides this correlation, one must exclude\nthe possibility of detecting both of the photons in one single channel to ensure\nthat the phenomena of quantum non-locality are really observed.\nAn apparently non-local correlation as expressed in the relation (10) are observed experimentally for the entangled photon pairs generated in the parametric down conversion nonlinear optical processes with a type-II phase matching.\nWe have to see if the possibility of detecting both of the photons in one single\nchannel can be ruled out in the experiment so that one can really interpret the\nexperimental results as an experimental evidence for quantum non-locality. So\nfar the following quantum state is used to describe this photon pair[11]:\n1\n|\u03c8e i = \u221a (b\u2020v1 b\u2020h2 \u2212 b\u2020v2 b\u2020h1 )|0i,\n2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere b\u2020h1 , b\u2020v1 , b\u2020h2 and b\u2020v2 are creation operators for horizontally polarized photons with the wave vector ~k1 , for vertically polarized photons with the wave\nvector ~k1 , for horizontally polarized photons with the wave vector ~k2 , and for\nvertically polarized photons with the wave vector ~k2 , respectively. By using the\ncorresponding photon annihilation operators, we may write the optical field as\n~ + = B(bv1~ev + bh1~eh )ei~k1 *~r + B(bv2~ev + bh2~eh )ei~k2 *~r .\nA\ne\n4\n\n(14)\n\n\fIt is easy to verify that there exists a correlation as described by the relation\n(10) between the polarization of the photon pairs in the quantum state |\u03c8e i.\nThe expression (13) for the quantum state of the entangled photon pairs was\nderived by taking into consideration of the energy and the momentum conservation in the parametric down conversion process. The energy and the momentum\nof a photon pair in the state |\u03c8e i is equal to the energy and the momentum of\nthe incident photon from which the photon pair is generated. But there is\na problem in this argument, namely the parametric down conversion process\ntakes place in nonlinear optical crystals, so one must take the photons and the\ncrystal as one single system when the condition of the energy and the momentum conservation is applied. The macroscopic properties of nonlinear optical\ncrystals do not change in the parametric down conversion process. Thus the\nexpectation values of the energy and the momentum of crystals are the same\nbefore and after the photon pairs' generation. Therefore the expectation values of energy and momentum of a photon pair must equal to the expectation\nvalues of energy and momentum of incident photon. This condition is satisfied\nby the quantum state |\u03c8e i. On other hand, photons are coupled with optical\nphonons with same momentum when passing through crystals, and there exist\nexchanges of energy and momentum between photons and crystals through the\nphoton-phonon interaction during photons' propagation in crystals. One may\nneglect the energy exchange between photons and crystals because the energies of phonons are much smaller than that of photons with same momentum,\nbut the momentum exchange between photons and crystals must be taken into\nconsideration. This exchange of momentum causes fluctuations in momenta of\ncrystals and generated photon pairs. But the state |\u03c8e i is an eigen-state of the\nphoton pairs' momentum, that means there is not momentum fluctuations for\nphoton pairs in the state |\u03c8e i. Therefore the generated photon pair can not be\nin this quantum state.\nAccording to the calculation made before, the correlation between the polarization of the photon pairs as described by the relation (10) does exist also\nfor photon pairs in the following quantum state\n|\u03c8u i =\n\n1\n1 \u2020\n(b + ib\u20202 )(b\u20201 \u2212 ib\u20202 )|0i = (b\u20201 b\u20201 + b\u20202 b\u20202 )|0i,\n2 1\n2\n\n(15)\n\nwith the optical field given by\nB\nB\n~\n~\n~+ = \u221a\nA\n(b1~ev \u2212 b2~eh )eik1 *~r + \u221a (b2~ev + b1~eh )eik2 *~r .\nu\n2\n2\n\n(16)\n\nThe quantum state |\u03c8u i is an un-entangled state. In fact, we can write |\u03c8u i as\nwith\nwhere\n\n|\u03c8u i = |\u03c8a i \u2297 |\u03c8b i,\n\n(17)\n\n|\u03c8a i = b\u2020a |0i, |\u03c8b i = b\u2020b |0i,\n\n(18)\n\n1\n1\nb\u2020a = \u221a (b\u20201 + ib\u20202 ), b\u2020b = \u221a (b\u20201 \u2212 ib\u20202 ), [b\u2020a , bb ] = 0.\n2\n2\n\n(19)\n\n5\n\n\fThe quantum state |\u03c8u i is not an eigen-state of momentum, but photon\npairs in the quantum states |\u03c8e i and |\u03c8u i have the same expectation values of\nthe energy and the momentum. So the quantum state |\u03c8u i satisfies the energy\nand momentum conservation requirement. In conclusion, the quantum state\n|\u03c8u i could be a correct description for photon pairs generated in the parametric down conversion nonlinear optical processes with a type-II phase matching.\nOne may observe that for photon pairs in the quantum state |\u03c8u i, both photons\ncould be detected in one single channel. Therefore, by applying the conditions\nof the energy and momentum conservation, we can not rule out the possibility\nof detecting both photons in one single channel. But, instead, we find that the\nphoton pairs can not be in the entangled state. The apparently non-local correlation between the polarization of photon pairs produced in the parametric\ndown conversion nonlinear optical processes, that were believed being in entangled states, is not a proof for the existence of the quantum non-locality, but just\na necessary evidence for the fact that photon pairs are in the quantum state\n|\u03c8u i.\nThe same conclusion holds also for photon pairs emitted in a radiative atomic\ncascade of calcium [2, 3]. In that process, electrons which emit two photons in a\nradiative cascade are well confined within the ions of calcium. The uncertainty\nin the momentum of electrons implies that the photon pairs can not be in the\nentangled state which has a well defined momentum. The quantum state for\nphoton pairs generated in this process could be expressed as\n1\n|\u03c8u\u2032 i = \u221a (b\u2020\u03c91 h b\u2020\u03c92 h + b\u2020\u03c91 v b\u2020\u03c92 v )|0i,\n2\n\n(20)\n\nwhere b\u2020\u03c91 h , b\u2020\u03c91 v are creation operators for horizontally, and respectively, vertically polarized photons of circle frequency \u03c91 , and b\u2020\u03c92 h , b\u2020\u03c92 v are the same\noperators for photons of circle frequency \u03c92 .\nThe optical field in the channel 1 is given by\n~ + = g11 (b\u03c91 v ~ev + b\u03c91 h~eh )eic\u03c91 ~n1 *~r + g12 (b\u03c92 v ~ev + b\u03c92 h~eh )eic\u03c92 ~n1 *~r\nA\n1\n\n(21)\n\n~ + = g21 (b\u03c91 v ~ev + b\u03c91 h~eh )eic\u03c91 ~n1 *~r + g22 (b\u03c92 v ~ev + b\u03c92 h~eh )eic\u03c92 ~n1 *~r\nA\n2\n\n(22)\n\nand\n\nin the channel 2, where ~n1 , ~n2 are vectors of unity that indicate the propagation directions of the channels 1 and 2, and g11 , g12 , g21 , g22 are coefficients that\ndepend on the geometry of the experiment setup. We can now calculate the\nprobability of annihilating simultaneously a photon of circle frequency \u03c91 polarized in the direction ~e\u03b81 in the channel 1 and a photon of circle frequency \u03c92\npolarized in the direction ~e\u03b82 in the channel 2. By using the expressions (20),\n(21) and (22), we find\n\u2032\nC12 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) = CM\ncos2 (\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 ).\n\n(23)\n\nThis is exactly the correlation observed in experimental tests carried out by\nAspect et al. [2, 3]. Again, no quantum non-locality is evolved, and both of the\nphotons can be detected in one single channel also in these tests.\n6\n\n\fD1\n\n\u03b81\nP1\n\n1\n\"entangled\"\nphoton pair\n\nBS\n\n2\n\n\u03b84\n\n4\nP3\n\n3\n\n\u03b83\n\nP4\nD4\n\nD3\n\nFigure 2: A schematic illustration of the experimental setup for testing the\npossibility of detecting both photons from one \"entangled\" photon pair in one\nsingle channel.

An experimental test on the possibility of\ndetecting both of the photons in one single channel can be done by using an\nexperimental setup shown in FIG. 2. This setup is quite similar to that used\nfor tests of quantum non-locality based on Bell's theorem. But a half reflecting\nmirror is inserted now into the channel 2 to split it into the channels 3 and 4,\nand the coincidence counting rate between the channels 3 and 4 is measured.\nThis coincidence counting rate is proportional to the polarization correlation\nbetween photons in the channel 3 and in the channel 4. An anti-coincidence\ncondition with the signal from the channel 1 can also be applied to ensure that\nthis coincidence counting rate is not from other sources. By using the expressions (15), (16), (13) and (14), one can easily verify that the following relation\nholds for this coincidence counting rate\n\u2032\u2032\nC(\u03b83 , \u03b84 ) = CM\ncos2 (\u03b83 \u2212 \u03b84 ),\n\n(24)\n\nif the photon pairs are in the quantum state |\u03c8u i, and\nC(\u03b83 , \u03b84 ) \u2261 0,\n\n(25)\n\nif the photon pairs are in the quantum state |\u03c8e i.\nThe coherence of photons in different channels can also be used for testing\nthe quantum state of \"entangled\" photon pairs. An experimental setup for such\na test is schematically illustrated in FIG. 3.

The polarization of\nthe beam 1 is changed to vertical later by the half wave plate W P . Both beams\nare reflected by the mirrors M1 and M2 to overlap each other. The single\nphoton counting rate I(x, y) in the (x, y) plan as a function of the coordinates\n(x, y) is measured by using the single photon detector D. Let f1 (x, y)~ev be\nthe distribution of the vector potential of the beam 1 in the plan (x, y), and\nf2 (x, y)~ev the distribution of the vector potential of the beam 2 . If the photon\npair were in the quantum state |\u03c8e i, we have\n~ + (x, y) = bh1 f1 (x, y)~ev + bv2 f2 (x, y)~ev .\nA\n\n(26)\n\nThe single photon counting rate I(x, y) is proportional to the matrix element\n~ +\u2020 (x, y) * A\n~ + (x, y)|\u03c8e i.\nI(x, y) \u221d h\u03c8e |A\n\n(27)\n\nI(x, y) \u221d |f1 (x, y)|2 + |f2 (x, y)|2 ,\n\n(28)\n\nBy using the relation (26) and the expression (13) for |\u03c8e i, we find, for photon\npairs in the quantum state |\u03c8e i,\nso no interference occurs. But if the photon pairs were in the quantum state\n|\u03c8u i, then according to Eq.(16), we have\n~ + (x, y) = b2 f1 (x, y)~ev + b2 f2 (x, y)~ev .\nA\n\n(29)\n\nAnd in this case the counting rate becomes\nI(x, y) \u221d |f1 (x, y) + f2 (x, y)|2 ,\n\n(30)\n\nthat means the beam 1 and beam 2 prepared in the way described above are\ncoherent.\n8\n\n\f5\n\ndiscussion\n\nI have shown that the correlations of photons' polarization observed in \"entangled\" photon pairs generated in the parametric down conversion nonlinear\noptical processes with a type-II phase matching and in a radiative atomic cascade of calcium are not proofs for quantum non-locality. Instead, they are\nnecessary evidences for the fact that \"entangled\" photon pairs are in the unentangled states |\u03c8u i or |\u03c8u\u2032 i. According to the expression (16) for the vector\npotential, in the case of \"entangled\" photon pairs generated in the parametric\ndown conversion nonlinear optical processes with a type-II phase matching, we\nmay express the operators b\u20201 and b\u20202 in terms of operators b\u2020v1 , b\u2020v2 , b\u2020h1 and b\u2020h2 :\n1\n1\nb\u20201 = \u221a (b\u2020v1 + b\u2020h2 ), b\u20202 = \u221a (b\u2020v2 \u2212 b\u2020h1 ).\n2\n2\n\n(31)\n\n1\n1\n|\u03c8u i = \u221a |\u03c8e i + (b\u2020v1 b\u2020v1 + b\u2020v2 b\u2020v2 + b\u2020h1 b\u2020h1 + b\u2020h2 b\u2020h2 )|0i.\n4\n2\n\n(32)\n\nWe have then\n\nAs the component (b\u2020v1 b\u2020v1 + b\u2020v2 b\u2020v2 + b\u2020h1 b\u2020h1 + b\u2020h2 b\u2020h2 )|0i in |\u03c8u i has no contribution to the coincidence counting rate between the signals from the channel 1\nand the channel 2, all apparently non-local correlations that were believed as\nspecificity of photon pairs in the entangled state |\u03c8e i, occur also in the case of\nun-entangled photon pairs in the state |\u03c8u i. The same conclusion holds also\nfor \"entangled\" photon pairs generated in a radiative atomic cascade of calcium Therefore no physical phenomena that necessitate introducing quantum\nnon-locality for their explanation are really observed.\nEinstein, Podolsky, Rosen (EPR) and Bohm had put the completeness of\nquantum mechanics in contradiction to the relativistic causality by supposing\nthe existence of particle pairs in entangled quantum states [14, 15]. But till\nnow, such a contradiction did not occur, because no particle pairs in entangled\nquantum states had been produced. Can particle pairs in entangled quantum\nstates be generated ever? It is most likely not. Due to the interaction with\nthe source of particle pairs, it should be impossible for the produced particle\npair with different momenta to be in a quantum state with well defined momentum, such as the entangled quantum state. This observation is consistent\nwith Santos's suggestion [7] that only quantum states which do not contradict\nwith locality requirement are physical states. From this point of view, the EPR\nparadox is just a spectacular illustration of the restriction on quantum states\nimposed by locality requirement.\n\nReferences\n[1] J. S.
