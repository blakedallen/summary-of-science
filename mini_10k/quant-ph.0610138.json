The computers have to execute a program, which is built with the help of a\nprecise set of instructions, in order to give the desired solution. A specification of this set of instructions is called an\nalgorithm. There are algorithms which can be performed faster on a quantum computer than on a classical one [1]:\nthe Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm for solving the oracle problem [2, 3, 4], the Shor algorithm for factoring large integers\n[5], and the Grover algorithm for searching unsorted databases [6].\nThe most important component of the computer architecture is the processor. One crucial property of the classical\nprocessor is that we keep the same circuit regardless of the instructions that we want to perform. One may then\nask how to construct a universal quantum processor, a fixed device that implements any desired program on the\ninformation stored in quantum systems? This problem was originally investigated by Nielsen and Chuang [7], where\nthey proposed a model of the quantum processor, which consists of a quantum gate array G acting on the data state\n| \u03c8 id and on the program state | P i. The dynamics of the quantum gate array is\nG[| d i| PU i] = (U | d i)| PU\u2032 i,\n\n(I.1)\n\nwhere U is a particular unitary operator implemented by the processor. Nielsen and Chuang found two important\nresults [7]: (i) the state | PU\u2032 i is independent of the data register | d i and (ii) no deterministic universal quantum\ngate array exists. Therefore they showed how to construct an one-output probabilistic quantum processor, whose\noperating principle is that of quantum teleportation [8]. The outcome of a Bell measurement tells us when the desired\noperation succeeded.\nIn the last few years, much progress has been made on generalizations and applications of the probabilistic quantum\nprocessor. Huelga et al. found a generalization of the method of teleporting a quantum gate from one location to\nanother [9, 10, 11]. Two more proposals of probabilistic quantum processors were considered by Preskill [12] and Vidal\net al. [13]. Vidal et al. analyzed a probabilistic gate, which performs an arbitrary rotation around the z axis of a\nspin-1/2 particle with the help of an N -qubit program state [13]. More complex probabilistic programmable quantum\nprocessors have been proposed by Hillery et al. [14, 15] by investigating the case when an arbitrary linear operation\nA is performed. They have built the network for this processor by using a quantum information distributor [16, 17]\nfor qubits and then for D-level systems (quDit). Hillery et al. have analyzed several classes of quantum processors,\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: iughiu@barutu.fizica.unibuc.ro\naddress: gunnarb@imit.kth.se\n\n\f2\nwhich execute more general operations, namely completely positive maps, on quantum systems [18]. In addition, they\nhave found two important results: one can build a quantum processor to perform the phase-damping channel and\nthat this is not possible in the case of the amplitude-damping channel [18].\nFurther extensions have been developed. In Refs. [19, 20] a quantum processor, which executes SU(N) rotations was\nconsidered, and was found that the probability of success for implementing the operation is increased if conditionated\nloops are used. Recently Brazier et al. have investigated the case when we have access to many copies of the program\nstate [21]. They have shown that the probability of success cannot be increased and that it is the same as the one\nobtained using two different schemes: VMC [13] and HZB [19]. Positive-operator-valued measures (POVM) are the\nmost general measurements allowed by quantum mechanics [1, 22]. Therefore it would be interesting to study the\npossibility of realizations of POVMs on quantum processors. This problem was investigated by Ziman and Bu\u017eek\n[23], where they showed how to encode a POVM into a program state. Another important class of operations is the\none of generators of Markovian dynamics, which are relevant in the context of quantum decoherence. Koniorczyk et\nal. have recently proposed a scenario for the simulation of the infinitesimal generators of the Markovian semigroup\non quantum processors [24]. Approximate processors, i.e. processors which implement a set of unitary operators with\nhigh precision, have been introduced by Hillery et al. in Ref. [25]. The accuracy of the processor is given by the\nprocess fidelity, which was shown to be maximum if one chooses the program state to be the eigenvector corresponding\nto the largest eigenvalue of a certain operator. This operator depends on some operators Ajk , which characterize the\nquantum processor, and the desired unitary operator U to be implemented. We emphasize that all the processors\ndescribed above generate only one output state. A two-output processor was proposed by Yu et al. [26] by combining\nsymmetric telecloning of qubits [27] with a programmable quantum gate array.\nIn this paper we present two different schemes for obtaining a two-output quantum gate for D-level systems.\nSuppose the following scenario: an observer Peter has to teleport the result of a certain operation to two distant\nparties, Alice and Bob. We show how this task can be accomplished using a shared entangled state, local operations,\nand classical communication (LOCC) by proposing two schemes. We restrict our study to a certain class of unitary\noperations, which depends on a parameter \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). In the first scheme, described in Sec. II. A, we extend Yu et\nal.'s scheme by considering asymmetric telecloning of qubits. The program state consists of a four-particle entangled\nstate shared between Peter, Alice, Bob, and another observer Charlie, who holds an ancillary system. (As Charlie's\nparticle is only used as a resource, and is discarded at the end, Peter and Charlie may be the same party in those\nschemes that do not need nonlocal operations between Alice's, Bob's and Charlie's particles.) Peter measures the data\nqubit and his particle P , which is included in the program register, in the standard Bell basis, and then communicates\nthe outcome. With a probability of 1/2, Alice and Bob are able to recover the desired mixed output states, whose\nfidelities are identical with the ones obtained by the optimal universal asymmetric Pauli cloning machine. We also\ndemonstrate that if Alice, Bob, and Charlie may use nonlocal operations, the protocol will always be successful with\npreserved fidelities. In Sec. II. B, we propose the second local protocol, which requires a four-particle entangled state\nas a quantum channel being distributed between Peter, Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The desired unitary operation is\nencoded in a generalized Bell basis. The protocol is as follows: Peter performs a measurement in the generalized Bell\nbasis and then announces the outcome to Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The probability of success of this second scheme\nis 1/2 and the asymmetric outputs received by Alice and Bob are identical with the ones obtained in the previous\nscheme. Given the resources of the four-particle states, these local schemes present the advantage that they can be\nimplemented in the lab.\nIn Sec. III we present the generalizations of these protocols for quDits. The two local generalized schemes are\nsuccessful with a probability equal to 1/D, while unit probability of success again requires nonlocal operations.\nFinally, in Sec. IV we summarize our conclusions.\nII.\n\nASYMMETRIC QUANTUM GATE ARRAY FOR QUBITS\n\nIn this section we present two schemes for performing the following scenario: we start with an arbitrary qubit state\n| \u03c8 id = \u03b10 | 0 i + \u03b11 | 1 i,\n\n(II.1)\n\nwhere |\u03b10 |2 +|\u03b11 |2 = 1. We want to obtain two optimal universal asymmetric clones of a certain unitary computational\noperator described by:\n\u0012 i\u03b8\n\u0013\ne\n0\nU\u03b8 =\n,\n(II.2)\n0 e\u2212i\u03b8\nwith \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), applied on the arbitrary input data state | \u03c8 id .\n\n\f3\nA.\n\nTwo-output quantum processor for qubits\n\nWe define a state required in the preparation of the program as\n1\n| \u03be iP ABC = \u221a (| 0 iP | \u03c60 iABC + | 1 iP | \u03c61 iABC ) ,\n2\n\n(II.3)\n\nwhere\n1\n| \u03c60 iABC = p\n[| 000 i + p| 011 i + (1 \u2212 p)| 101 i] , and\n2(1 \u2212 p + p2 )\n1\n[| 111 i + p| 100 i + (1 \u2212 p)| 010 i] ,\n| \u03c61 iABC = p\n2(1 \u2212 p + p2 )\n\n(II.4)\n\nwith 0 < p < 1. The two states | \u03c60 i and | \u03c61 i are obtained by applying an optimal universal asymmetric Pauli\ncloning machine on the states | 0 i| 00 i and | 1 i| 00 i [28]. The data system d and the first qubit P of the state | \u03be i\nbelong to an observer Peter, while the qubits A, B, C are held by other distant parties, Alice, Bob, and Charlie,\nrespectively. This \"ownership\" of the qubits (or, later, quDits) will hold for all our schemes. Note that, in the case\nof the \"local\" schemes, Peter and Charlie may be identically the same, as Charlie's qubit is discarded at the end.\nPeter wants to teleport the result of the desired unitary operator U\u03b8 to Alice and Bob. Peter encodes the information\ncarried by the unitary operator, in the program state | PU iP ABC by locally applying U\u03b8 on the qubit P (see Fig. 1):\n\u0001\n1\n| PU iP ABC = U\u03b8 \u2297 IABC | \u03be iP ABC = \u221a ei\u03b8 | 0 iP | \u03c60 iABC + e\u2212i\u03b8 | 1 iP | \u03c61 iABC .\n2\nLet us write now the input state with the help of the standard Bell basis | \u03a6\u00b1 i =\n\u221a1 (| 01 i \u00b1 | 10 i):\n2\n| \u03c8 id | PU iP ABC =\n\n\u221a1 (| 00 i\n2\n\n(II.5)\n\n\u00b1 | 11 i) and | \u03a8\u00b1 i =\n\n1\n[| \u03a6+ idP (\u03b10 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i + \u03b11 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i)\n2\n+| \u03a6\u2212 idP (\u03b10 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i \u2212 \u03b11 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i)\n+| \u03a8+ idP (\u03b11 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i + \u03b10 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i)\n+| \u03a8\u2212 idP (\u03b11 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i \u2212 \u03b10 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i)].\n\n(II.6)\n\nPeter performs a measurement in the Bell basis on the data qubit and the first qubit P in the program state as it\nis shown in Fig. 1. Then he communicates the outcome of the measurement to Alice, Bob, and Charlie. With a\nprobability equal to 1/4 the outcome is | \u03a6+ idP and therefore the output is projected to\n| \u03b7 iABC = \u03b10 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i + \u03b11 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i.\n\n(II.7)\n\nAccordingly, after tracing over Charlie's qubit, the two final states of Alice and Bob, rspectively, are:\n\u03c1A = TrB,C | \u03b7 ih \u03b7 | =\n\u03c1B\n\n1\n{[2p|\u03b10 |2 + (1 \u2212 p)2 ]| 0 ih 0 | + [2p|\u03b11 |2 + (1 \u2212 p)2 ]| 1 ih 1 |]\n2(1 \u2212 p + p2 )\n\n+2p\u03b10 \u03b1\u22171 e2i\u03b8 | 0 ih 1 | + 2p\u03b1\u22170 \u03b11 e\u22122i\u03b8 | 1 ih 0 |};\n1\n{[2(1 \u2212 p)|\u03b10 |2 + p2 ]| 0 ih 0 | + [2(1 \u2212 p)|\u03b11 |2 + p2 ]| 1 ih 1 |]\n= TrA,C | \u03b7 ih \u03b7 | =\n2(1 \u2212 p + p2 )\n+2(1 \u2212 p)\u03b10 \u03b1\u22171 e2i\u03b8 | 0 ih 1 | + 2(1 \u2212 p)\u03b1\u22170 \u03b11 e\u22122i\u03b8 | 1 ih 0 |}.\n\n(II.8)\n\nThe efficiency of the quantum processor is evaluated with the help of the fidelities of the output states with respect\nto the exact data register outputs U\u03b8 | \u03c8 id :\n1 + p2\n, and\n2(1 \u2212 p + p2 )\n2 \u2212 2p + p2\n.\n= d h \u03c8 |U\u03b8\u2020 \u03c1B U\u03b8 | \u03c8 id =\n2(1 \u2212 p + p2 )\n\nFA =\nFB\n\n\u2020\nd h \u03c8 |U\u03b8 \u03c1A U\u03b8 | \u03c8 id\n\n=\n\n(II.9)\n\n\f4\n|\u03c8 d\n\nBell\nP\n\nU\n\n\u03b8\n\nA\n\nM.\nV\n\nA\n\n|\u03be\n\nB\nV\n\nB\n\n|\u03b7\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\nC\nV\n\nC\n\nA\n\nB\n\nFIG. 1: The scheme for the quantum processor for qubits. The input states consist of: an arbitrary data register | \u03c8 id and the\nprogram register | PU iP ABC = U\u03b8 \u2297 IABC | \u03be iP ABC . Alice and Bob will obtain two mixed states \u03c1A , \u03c1B that are implemented\nby the quantum processor.\n\nIf the output of the measurement is | \u03a6\u2212 idP , then the final state is\n| \u03b7 \u2032 iABC = \u03b10 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i \u2212 \u03b11 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i.\n\n(II.10)\n\nAlice, Bob, and Charlie can transform the state | \u03b7 \u2032 i to the state | \u03b7 i of Eq. (II.7) by applying the local unitary\noperator V = \u03c3zA \u2297 \u03c3zB \u2297 \u03c3zC . Therefore, in this case, Alice and Bob obtain the same final states \u03c1A and \u03c1B as above.\nFor the other two outcomes, when Peter obtains | \u03a8+ idP and | \u03a8\u2212 idP , the result cannot be transformed to the state\nof Eq. (II.7) by local operations. Hence there is no chance to obtain the desired mixed outputs \u03c1A and \u03c1B if we\ndon't allow for nonlocal transformations. The processor hence succeeds with the probability 1/2 and generates two\nasymmetric output mixed states. The fidelities of the final states given by Eq. (II.9) are identical with the ones of the\nclones emerging from the optimal universal asymmetric cloning machine given in Refs. [28, 29, 30]. In the particular\ncase when p = 1/2, we recover the result of Yu et al. [26].\nHowever, if we allow nonlocal operations between Alice, Bob, and Charlie, which either entails their respective\nparticles to interact directly, or via a shared auxiliary entangled state, it is also possible to convert the states | \u03a8+ idP\nand | \u03a8\u2212 idP to | \u03b7 i and thereby always succeed with the protocol. This is generally true for all our proposed schemes.\nB.\n\nTwo-output local quantum gate for qubits\n\nWe use the same channel | \u03be iP ABC of Eq. (II.3) initially shared by Peter, Alice, Bob, and Charlie as above, but\nthis time Peter performs a measurement in a different Bell basis, which depends on \u03b8 (see Fig. 2):\n\u0001\n1\n| \u03a6\u0303\u00b1 i = \u221a e\u2212i\u03b8 | 00 i \u00b1 ei\u03b8 | 11 i ,\n2\n\u0001\n1\n\u00b1\n| \u03a8\u0303 i = \u221a e\u2212i\u03b8 | 01 i \u00b1 ei\u03b8 | 10 i .\n2\n\n(II.11)\n\nThe input state can be written as follows\n| \u03c8 id | \u03be iP ABC =\n\n1\n[| \u03a6\u0303+ idP (\u03b10 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i + \u03b11 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i)\n2\n+| \u03a6\u0303\u2212 idP (\u03b10 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i \u2212 \u03b11 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i)\n\n+| \u03a8\u0303+ idP (\u03b11 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i + \u03b10 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i)\n\n+| \u03a8\u0303\u2212 idP (\u03b11 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i \u2212 \u03b10 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i)].\n\n(II.12)\n\nPeter communicates the outcome to Alice, Bob, and Charlie. If the result of the measurement of particles d and P is\n| \u03a6\u0303+ idP , then we get the same state | \u03b7 i of Eq. (II.7):\n| \u03b7 iABC = \u03b10 ei\u03b8 | \u03c60 i + \u03b11 e\u2212i\u03b8 | \u03c61 i.\n\n(II.13)\n\n\f5\n|\u03c8 d\n\nBell\nM.\n\nP\n\n\u03b8\n\nA\n\nV\n\nA\n\n|\u03be\n\nB\nV\nC\nV\n\nB\n\n\u03c1\n\n|\u03b7\n\n\u03c1\n\nC\n\nA\n\nB\n\nFIG. 2: The scheme for the local quantum gate-array for qubits. The information of the operation to be performed is encoded\nin a generalized Bell basis. Peter performs a measurement in this generalized Bell basis and then communicates the outcome\nto Alice, Bob, and Charlie. By LOCC, Alice and Bob are able to get the mixed states \u03c1A , \u03c1B .\n\nAlice and Bob easily obtain the two asymmetric outputs \u03c1A and \u03c1B given by Eq. (II.8). If the outcome is | \u03a6\u0303\u2212 idP , then\nAlice, Bob, and Charlie apply the local operator V = \u03c3zA \u2297 \u03c3zB \u2297 \u03c3zC in order to recover the state | \u03b7 i. The other two\noutcomes | \u03a8\u0303+ idP and | \u03a8\u0303\u2212 idP will lead to a different result and the procedure fails unless nonlocal transformations\nare used. Hence, the total success probability is p = 1/2. This protocol is constructed using only LOCC and therefore\nit is suitable for distant computation at two locations.\nIII.\n\nASYMMETRIC QUANTUM GATE ARRAY FOR QUDITS\nA.\n\nTwo-output quantum processor for quDits\n\nOne-output probabilistic programable quantum processors have recently been analyzed by Hillery et al. [14, 19]\nin the case when the data are encoded on a D-level systems (quDits). More precisely, they have investigated the\npossibility to construct a processor which performs an arbitrary linear operation A [14]:\nA=\n\nD\u22121\nX\n\nqmn U (mn) ,\n\n(III.1)\n\nm,n=0\n\nwhere the operators U (mn) form a basis in the Hilbert-Schmidt space\nU\n\n(mn)\n\n:=\n\nD\u22121\nX\ns=0\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0ism\nexp \u2212\n| s \u2212 n ih s |.\nD\n\n(III.2)\n\nWe now propose a generalization of the quantum processor presented in the Sec.

However, both in\nthis and the following protocol, the success probability can be boosted to unity if the three parties may use nonlocal\noperations on their particles.\nB.\n\nTwo-output local quantum gate for quDits\n\nOur input data state is an arbitrary quDit given by Eq.

III. A by Eq. (III.6) while | \u03c6j i are given by Eq. (III.5). Peter\nperforms a measurement in the new Bell basis on particles d and P . The interesting measurement outcome is | \u03a6\u03030,n i\nobtained with the probability equal to 1/D2 . Accordingly, the projected state of particles A, B, and C is | \u03b7 \u2032 i given\nby Eq. (III.11). Alice, Bob, and Charlie have to apply the same local unitary operator Vn described in the previous\nsubsection in order that Alice and Bob to obtain the two asymmetric outputs \u03c1A and \u03c1B of Eq. (III.14). The total\nsuccess probability of this scheme is 1/D, because there are D outcome | \u03a6\u03030,n i.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have demonstrated the possibility of building a two-output programmable processor of qubits, which\ngenerates two asymmetric states with a probability of success of 1/2. It is characterized by the same fidelities as the\n\n\f8\nones generated by the optimal universal asymmetric Pauli cloning machine. We have analyzed a second protocol which\nperforms the same task, being performed with the help of a generalized Bell basis. We implement these schemes by\nusing only local operations and classical communication, and therefore they are suitable for distributed computation\nto two spatially separated receivers.\nIn addition, we have presented the generalizations of these two protocols to D-level systems. The generalizations\npresent the advantage of sending the outcomes to different locations and they are achieved with a probability of 1/2.\nFinally, we have shown how to increase the success probability to unity by considering nonlocal operations. In this\ncase the two output states are obtained only after the particles A, B, and C have interacted, either directly or through\nan auxiliary entangled state.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was sponsored by the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF), the Swedish Research Council\n(VR), the Romanian CNCSIS through the grant TD 2915-232/2006 for the University of Bucharest, and CEEX for\nthe University of Bucharest.\n\n[1] M.
