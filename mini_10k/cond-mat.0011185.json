Charge\nand spin-correlation functions and optical conductivity are calculated by using finite-temperature\nLanczos method. At zero temperature, the antiferromagnetic correlation between a spin in a charge\nstripe and that in a spin domain adjacent to the stripe is weak, since the charge stripe and the\nspin domain are almost separated. With increasing temperature, the correlation increases and then\ndecreases toward high temperature. This is in contrast to other correlations that decrease monotonically. From the examination of the charge dynamics, we find that this anomalous temperature\ndependence of the correlation is the consequence of a crossover from one-dimensional electronic\nstates to two-dimensional ones.\nPACS numbers: 74.20.Mn, 71.10.Fd, 74.25.Jb, 78.20.Bh\n\ncarriers. At the same time, the zero temperature calculation11 has shown that the spin correlation inside the\nspin domains is as strong as those for the Heisenberg spin\nsystem, whereas the correlation between a spin in a spin\ndomain and that in a charge stripe adjacent to the domain is weak since the charge stripe and the spin domain\nare almost separated.\nWith the increase of temperature, the one-dimensional\nelectronic states in the stripe phase mentioned above\nare expected to be destroyed and evolved into the twodimensional ones. Therefore it is interesting to know how\nsuch evolution occurs and how the physical quantities\nare affected by the evolution. In this study, we clarify the temperature dependence of the electronic state in\nthe stripe phase. By using the finite-temperature Lanczos method developed by Jakli\u010d and P. Prelov\u0161ek,14,15\nwe calculate the optical conductivity and spin-correlation\nfunctions at finite temperatures in the t-J model with a\npotential that stabilizes the vertical charge stripes. We\nfind that the spin correlation between a spin in the charge\nstripe and that in the spin domain increases with increasing temperature and then decreases toward higher temperature. This is in contrast to other spin correlations\nthat decrease monotonically. By examining the dependence of charge dynamics on temperature, this anomalous temperature dependence of the spin correlation is\nconcluded to be the consequence of a crossover from onedimensional electronic states to two-dimensional ones.\nWe introduce our model, i.e., a t-J model with a stripe\npotential, and show outlines of the finite temperature\nLanczos method in Sec. II. In Sec. III, results and discussions on the temperature dependence of spin-and chargecorrelation functions and the optical conductivity are\npresented. A possible method to confirm experimentally\nthe evolution of the electronic states in stripe phase with\ntemperature is also proposed. The summary is given in\nSec. IV.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nCharge stripes and related phenomena are now\nhot topics in the high-Tc superconductor research\nfield.\nNeutron-scattering measurements performed\non La1.475 Nd0.4 Sr0.125 CuO4 (LNSC) with the lowtemperature tetragonal (LTT) structure have revealed\nthe presence of a charge order and an incommensurate\nmagnetic order.1 These charge and spin orders have been\nexplained by assuming a stripe structure that consists of\nvertical charge stripes and antiphase between spin domains. The incommensurate magnetic order has been\nobserved not only in LNSC but also in La2\u2212x Srx CuO4\n(LSC) with x \u2243 0.12 carrier doping.2\u20134 Around this carrier concentration, an incomplete phase transition from\nthe low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase to the\nLTT phase has been observed.5\u20138 While clear evidence\nof the charge order has not been reported, it is considered that the electronic states in LSC are similar to those\nin the LNSC.\nAnomalous behaviors that are supposed to be related\nto the presence of the stripes have been observed in the\nangle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) spectrum as suppressed spectral weight along the (0,0)-(\u03c0,\u03c0) direction9\nand in the optical conductivity as the enhancement of intensity in the mid-infrared region.10 These features have\nbeen explained by the present authors, by using the exact diagonalization calculation at zero-temperature for a\nmodel that includes both the strong electron correlation\nand the stripes, i.e., a t-J model with an additional potential introduced to stabilize vertical charge stripes.11\nThe ground state of the model is characterized by the\ncharge stripes along which the charge carriers can move\ncoherently, but perpendicular to which charge carriers\nshow only incoherent motion. This situation is consistent\nwith the behavior of the Hall coefficient at low temperature12 as well as the ARPES data13 in LNSC, both of\nwhich indicate the one-dimensional motion of the charge\n1\n\n\fwhere Z is the partition function defined as Z =\nL\nP\n\u03a8l e\u2212\u03b2H \u03a8l , {|\u03a8l i} is a complete basis set, L is\n\nII. MODEL AND NUMERICAL METHOD\n\nWe introduce the t-J model, which is given by\nX \u2020\nX\n(c\u0303i\u03c3 c\u0303j\u03c3 + H.c.) ,\nSi * Sj \u2212 t\nHtJ = J\n\nl=1\n\nthe dimension of the Hamiltonian, and \u03b2 = 1/kB T , kB\nbeing the Boltzmann factor. Hereafter, kB is set to be\n1. In order to obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues, we\nuse the Lanczos procedure. We set an arbitrary vector\n|\u03a8l i as the initial vector of the Lanczos step \u03c81l , i.e.,\nl\nstep by\n\u03c81l = |\u03a8l i, and calculate \u03c82l , \u03c83l , . . . , \u03c8M\nstep,\n\n(1)\n\n{i,j}\u03c3\n\n{i,j}\n\nwhere c\u0303i\u03c3 = ci\u03c3 (1 \u2212 ni\u2212\u03c3 ) is the annihilation operator\nof an electron with spin \u03c3 at site i with the constraint\nof no double occupancy, Si is the spin operator, and the\nsummation {i, j} runs over the nearest-neighbor pairs.\nIt is controversial whether the t-J model itself has the\nstripe-type ground state.16\u201319 A possible origin of the\nappearance of stable stripe phase is due to the presence\nof the long-range part of the Coulomb interaction20\u201322\nand/or the coupling to lattice distortions. In LSC, the\nLTT fluctuation seems to help the latter mechanism.7,8 In\nfact, the LTT structure makes Cu-O bonds anisotropic,\nleading to directional distribution of carriers through the\nanisotropy of the Madelung potential at in-plane oxygen\nsites and that of the hopping amplitude between Cu and\nO.\nTo model the directional charge distribution and the\ntendency toward the stripe instability as simply as possible, we introduce a configuration-dependent stripe potential VS (nh ).11 The magnitude of the stripe potential\nis assumed to depend on the number of holes nh in each\ncolumn: VS (nh ) = 0 for nh =0 and 1 and VS (nh ) = \u2212nh V\nfor nh \u22652 with V > 0. VS (nh ) behaves like an attractive potential for holes independent of distance between\nholes. In the following, we use a 4\u00d74 cluster of the t-J\nmodel with two holes to simulate the underdoped system.\nAmong four columns in the cluster, the stripe potential\nVS (nh ) is introduced into the second column from the\nleft. Periodic and open boundary conditions are imposed\nalong the directions parallel and perpendicular to the column, respectively.23\nWe set parameters J/t=0.4 (t \u2243 0.35 eV), and V /t=1\nto obtain the ground state with charge stripes.11 Here,\nwe note that, if V = 0, the ground state in small clusters\nis not the stripe state but a uniform state as discussed by\nHellberg and Manousakis17 and the energy difference between the two states is of the order of J.24 In order for the\nstripe phase to be in the ground state, it is necessary to\nintroduce V with a magnitude of more than J. Therefore\nV /t=1 is chosen to make the stripe state stable enough.\nExamining the V dependence of the spin and charge correlation functions discussed in the next section, we have\nfound that their behaviors are not altered qualitatively if\nV > J.\nWe\nemploy\nthe\nfinite temperature Lanczos method.14,15 Outlines of this\nmethod are as follows. The statistical expectation value\nof an operator \u00c2 is given by\nL\nD E\nE\n1 XD\n\u00c2 =\n\u03a8l e\u2212\u03b2H \u00c2 \u03a8l ,\nZ\n\nH \u03c81l = al1 \u03c81l + bl2 \u03c82l ,\nH \u03c82l = bl2 \u03c81l + al2 \u03c82l + bl3 \u03c83l ,\n..\n.\nl\nl\nl\nl\nH \u03c8M\u22121\n= blM\u22121 \u03c8M\u22122\n+ alM\u22121 \u03c8M\u22121\n+ blM \u03c8M\n,\nl\nH \u03c8M\n\nl\nl\n= blM \u03c8M\u22121\n+ alM \u03c8M\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere M is a given maximum number of Lanczos steps.\nThen, we obtain a tridiagonal matrix with diagonal elements ali with i = 1, . . . , M and off-diagonal ones bli with\ni = 2, . . . , M , ali and bli being real. After diagonalizing\nthe matrix, we obtain \"eigenvalues\" \u01eblm and \"eigenvectors\" \u03c6lm ( m = 1, . . . , M ). Since we stop the Lanczos\nsteps at M steps, these \"eigenvalues\" and \"eigenvectors\"\nare approximate ones. After sampling some arbitrary\nvectors |\u03a8l i ( l = 1, . . . , L0 ; L0 \u226a L ) and repeating the\nabove process Eq. (3), the expectation value is given by\nL0 X\nM\nD E\nE\nD\nl\n1 X\n\u00c2 \u223c\ne\u2212\u03b2\u01ebm \u03a8l \u03c6lm \u03c6lm \u00c2 \u03a8l ,\nZ\u0303 l=1 m=1\n\nwhere Z\u0303 =\n\nL0 P\nM\nP\n\nl=1 m=1\n\nl\n\ne\u2212\u03b2\u01ebm\n\n\u03a8l \u03c6lm\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\n. If we chose all\n\nvectors of the basis set, i.e., L0 = L and obtained eigenvectors and eigenvalues exactly, Eq. (4) should be equivalent to Eq. (2). Jakli\u010d and Prelov\u0161ek have shown that, by\nL\nP\n\u03b2rl |\u03a8l i (\u03b2rl is randomly\nusing a random state |ri =\nl=1\n\ndistributed) instead of |\u03a8l i, the expectation value obtained using Eq. (4) agrees well with the exact one even\nif L0 and M are much smaller than L.14 Similar to static\nquantities Eq.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFigure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the hole\ncorrelations given by Eq. (6) in the t-J model with the\nstripe potential of V /t=1. At T /t=0, the correlations of\nholes in the vertical directions labeled c and d are larger\nthan those in the horizontal direction labeled a and b.\nThis anisotropic behavior is due to inhomogeneous distribution of holes induced by the stripe potential. With\nincreasing temperature, the correlations in the c and d\nconfigurations decrease, while those in a and b increase.\nTherefore the anisotropic behavior of the correlations indicating the confinement of holes in the stripe becomes\nless pronounced at finite temperatures. The evolution\nof the hole confinement in the stripe is also observed by\nexamining the hole occupation number as a function of\ntemperature (not shown here); the hole number inside\n(outside) the stripe decreases (increases) monotonically\nwith increasing temperature.\nFigure 3 shows the results of the spin-correlation function around a hole,11 which is defined as\n\n(6)\n\n~ i \u2212 R~j , R\n~ i is the position vector for the site\nwhere ~r = R\nh\ni, ni = 1 \u2212 ni is the hole-number operator at site i. In\nthe figure, the hole correlations with two-lattice spacing\nlabeled b and d are plotted, because the two correlations\nshould be equivalent in magnitude in two-dimensional\nsystems. The magnitude of the correlation in the b configuration is almost identical to that of d above T \u22430.3t.\nHowever, below T \u22430.3t, the two correlations show different temperature dependence. This is due to the difference of the boundary conditions imposed on the cluster.\nTherefore the characteristic temperature T \u2217 in the t-J\ncluster without the stripe potential is about 0.3t. Even\nin the presence of the stripe potential, we assume that T \u2217\ndoes not change so much from 0.3t. In fact, the average\nlevel spacing in the low-energy sector is similar. In the\nfollowing, we will show the results for T /t\u22650.3.\nAt T = 0, we employ the standard Lanczos technique\nto calculate various quantities. In this case, it is necessary to examine the dependence of given quantities on\nsize and boundary condition in order to estimate finitesize effects. We have examined the dependence by using\nother clusters with two holes (5\u00d74 with the same boundary condition and 4\u00d74 with periodic boundary condition\nalong both the directions) and have found that the hole\nand spin-correlation functions discussed in the next sec-\n\nC (\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 ) =\n\n1 X h z\nz\nni Si+\u03b1 Si+\u03b1\n\u2032\nNh i\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 denote two sites around a hole at site i in\nthe stripe following the labeling convention of configurations shown in the inset of Fig. 3, and Nh is the number of\nholes (Nh =2). At high temperatures, all of the nearestneighbor spin correlations in the a, c, e, and f configurations are antiferromagnetic and have the same magnitude, because all spins are disordered by the thermal\n3\n\n\fw\n\nc\nd\n\n0.06\n\n0.00\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\na\n\ne\n\nb f\n\na : r = (1,0)\nb : r = (2,0)\nc : r = (0,1)\nd : r = (0,2)\n\n0.06\n\nw\n\nd\ne\nf\n\nC S( r )\n\na\nb\nc\n\nw\n\n\u2212 C (\u03b1,\u03b1' )\n\n0.12\n\nw\n\n0.12\n\n0.00\n0.0\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\nTemperature T/t\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nTemperature T/t\n\nFIG. 3.

The open circle in the\ninset denotes a hole.\n\nFIG. 4. Spin-correlation function CS (~r) in the t-J model\nwith the stripe potential on a 4\u00d74 cluster with two holes.\nJ/t=0.4 and V /t=1.0.\n\nis restored with increasing temperature. This picture will\nbe confirmed by examining the optical conductivity as\nshown below.\nIn Fig. 4, we show the result of the spin-correlation\nfunction given by\n\nfluctuation. The spin correlations between third nearest neighbors (the b and d configurations) are the same.\nWith decreasing temperature, holes begin to be confined\ninto the charge stripes and the magnitude of the spin\ncorrelations increase. The charge stripes make spin correlation anisotropic below T /t \u22430.8. The temperature\ndependence of the spin correlations in the spin domain\n(the e and f configurations) differs from that of the spin\ncorrelations related with a spin in the charge stripe (a and\nc). At the same time, the spin correlations in the b and d\nconfigurations become different. In the low-temperature\nregion (T /t \u22640.4), the nearest-neighbor spin correlations\ninside the spin domains (e and f) show temperature dependence similar to that in the Heisenberg spin system\n(not shown here) because of the confinement of holes in\nthe charge stripe.\nThe correlation between a spin in the charge stripe\nand that in the spin domain (the a configuration) in\nFig. 3 shows interesting temperature dependence below\nT /t \u22430.4, when the lowest-temperature data are connected to the zero-temperature ones: The correlation is\nmuch suppressed at T /t=0, while other spin correlations\n(b to f) are enhanced. This anomalous temperature dependence of the a configuration can be understood in the\nfollowing way: At T /t=0, holes move along the charge\nstripe coherently and large Drude weight is obtained parallel to the stripe.11 Spin correlation in the configuration\na is thus suppressed in order to stabilize the coherent\nmotion of holes. With increasing temperature, hole carriers enter into the spin domain, and thermally fluctuating spins in the stripe disturb the motion of holes along\nthe stripe. These effects recover interaction between the\nstripe and the spin domain, and thus the spin correlation\nin the a configuration is enhanced with the gain of the exchange energy. In other words, although the charge stripe\nand the spin domain are almost separated at T /t=0, the\ninteraction between the charge stripe and the spin domain is recovered and two-dimensional electronic system\n\nCS (~r) =\n\n1 X\nP (i, j) Siz Sjz ,\nNp\n\n(8)\n\nhi,ji\n\n~ i \u2212 R~j , and P (i, j) is 1 when i and j are\nwhere ~r = R\nin the same sublattice and it is \u22121 otherwise. The summation hi, ji runs over all the pairs satisfying a given ~r,\nand Np is the number of the pairs. As seen in the figure,\nthe stripe potential, which confines holes in the charge\nstripe, makes the spin correlation anisotropic. For example, the spin correlation parallel to the stripe labeled c\n(d) is larger than that perpendicular to the stripe labeled\na (b) below T /t \u22430.8. With increasing temperature, the\nanisotropy decreases.\nNext, we examine the temperature dependence of the\noptical conductivity.

The dramatic increase\nreg\nof \u03c3// (\u03c9) from T /t=0 to T /t=0.3 is caused by the spectral weight transfer from the Drude weight parallel to the\nstripe D// as discussed below. Another interesting point\nreg\nin Fig. 5(b) is that the intensity of \u03c3//\n(\u03c9) increases with\nincreasing temperature from T /t=0.3 to T /t=0.4, and\nthen decreases with further increase of T . The intensity\nmaximum at T /t \u22430.4 is related to the maximum of I//\n[= Iyy ] shown in Fig. 6(b). Note that I// is the integrated spectral weight of the regular part of the optical\nreg\nconductivity \u03c3//\n(\u03c9) [see Eq. (14)]. Here, let us consider\nthe origin of this maximum. At T /t=0, since the motion\nof holes in the charge stripe is coherent, D// is very large\nwhile D\u22a5 is almost zero as shown in Fig. 6(a). On the\ncontrary, I// is suppressed compared with I\u22a5 . With increasing temperature, the motion of holes in the stripe\nbecomes incoherent, because spins in the charge stripe\nfluctuate thermally as is evidenced by the spin correlations in the c and d configurations in Fig. 3. As a result,\nD// is strongly suppressed, while I// is enhanced with\nthe increase of temperature. The kinetic energy along\nthe charge stripe hK// i [= hKy i] exhibits small temperature dependence below T /t \u2243 0.5. From the sum rule\nEq. (13), this means that almost all of the intensity of\n\nspacing. Other definitions are standard. Adding singureg\nlar contribution to \u03c3\u03bc\u03bc\n(\u03c9), the real part of the optical\nconductivity reads\nreg\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bc (\u03c9) = 2\u03c0e2 D\u03bc \u03b4(\u03c9) + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bc\n(\u03c9) ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the so-called Drude weight D\u03bc is given by\nD\u03bc = \u2212\n\n1\nhK\u03bc i\n\u2212 2 I\u03bc\u03bc\n2N\n\u03c0e\n\n(13)\n\nwith\nI\u03bc\u03bc =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n+0\n\nreg\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bc\n(\u03c9) d\u03c9 .\n\n(14)\n\nHere, hK\u03bc i is the kinetic energy in the \u03bc direction. We set\nh\u0304=e=a0 =1 hereafter. \u03a9\u03bc\u03bc (\u03c9) is calculated using Eq. (5).\nFigures 5(a) and (b) show the regular part of the optireg\nreg\ncal conductivity \u0002perpendicular,\n\u03c3\u22a5\n(\u03c9) [= \u03c3xx\n(\u03c9)], and\n\u0003\nreg\nreg\nparallel, \u03c3// (\u03c9) = \u03c3yy (\u03c9) , to the stripe, respectively.\nreg\nAt T /t=0, the intensity of \u03c3\u22a5\n(\u03c9) is larger than that of\nreg\n\u03c3// (\u03c9) for \u03c9/t \u22641.0. In contrast, in the temperature rereg\ngion of T /t \u2265 0.3, the intensity of \u03c3//\n(\u03c9) for \u03c9/t \u22641.0 is\n5\n\n\freg\nD// transfers to the regular part \u03c3//\n. With further increase of temperature above T /t \u2243 0.5, hK// i gradually\ndecreases. Since D// is almost zero in such high temperature, the decrease of hK// i leads to the decrease of\nI// . Therefore I// shows a maximum at the temperature Tm \u22430.45t. We have examined the dependence of\nTm on the parameters V and J; Tm /t\u22430.4, 0.45, and 0.6\nfor J/t=0.2, 0.4, and 0.8, respectively, keeping V /t=1.0,\nand Tm /t\u22430.4, 0.45, and 0.5 for V /t=0.5, 1.0, and 2.0,\nrespectively, keeping J/t=0.4. Tm is found to be dependent not only on V but also strongly on J. These data\nare consistent with a picture that the spin degree of freedom plays an important role in the charge dynamics in\nthe stripe phase.\nMoreover, we find an interesting temperature dependence of the kinetic energy in Fig. 6(b). At T /t=0, hK// i\nis larger than hK\u22a5 i as expected. With increasing temperature, hK// i gradually decreases. Such a decrease is\nalso seen in the t-J model without the stripe potential\n(not shown here). In contrast, hK\u22a5 i at T /t=0.3 is larger\nthan that at T /t=0. This anomalous increase of hK\u22a5 i\nis consistent with the picture proposed above, i.e., onedimensional nature of the electronic states due to the\ncharge stripe is destroyed by the thermal fluctuation of\nspins and thus two-dimensional electronic states are restored.\nFinally, we propose a possible method to compare the\npresent results of the temperature dependence of \u03c3(\u03c9)\nwith experimental ones. The frequency dependence of\neffective carrier number Nef f (\u03c9) is experimentally evaluated from the optical conductivity\n\u0001 R \u03c9 by using a relation that Nef f (\u03c9) = 2mV / \u03c0e2 0 \u03c3(\u03c9 \u2032 )d\u03c9 \u2032 , where m\nis the mass of a free electron and V is the volume of\nthe unit cell.25 From the theoretical side, the effective\ncarrier number in high-frequency limit \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e is proportional to the average of the kinetic Renergies hK\u22a5 i\n\u221e\nand hK// i because \u0001of a relation that 0 \u03c3(\u03c9)d\u03c9 =\n\u2212\u03c0e2 hK\u22a5 i + hK// i /(4N ). Since the dominant part of\nthe temperature-induced change of the calculated \u03c3// (\u03c9)\nand \u03c3\u22a5 (\u03c9) is concentrated in the region of \u03c9 <\n\u223c3t (\u22431 eV),\nthe change of the averaged kinetic energies can be a\nmeasure of the change of the effective carrier number\nup to around 1 eV. In a realistic temperature region\n(T < J=0.4t), hK// i is almost temperature independent, while hK\u22a5 i increases with increasing T because of\nthe destruction of the stripe as mentioned above. Thus\nthe averaged kinetic energy increases. We propose that\nNef f (\u03c9) at around \u03c9\u22431 eV in the stripe phase of the\nhigh-Tc cuprates increases with increasing temperature.\nThis may be detectable from the detailed analysis of the\ntemperature dependence of experimental data.\n\nstripes. The spin-correlation function, the optical conductivity, and the kinetic energy have been calculated by\nusing the finite temperature Lanczos method. We have\nfound that the motion of holes along the charge stripes,\nwhich is coherent at T /t=0, becomes incoherent with increasing temperature. We have also found that the spin\ncorrelation between a spin in the charge stripe and that\nin the spin domain is smaller than that for other spin\npairs at T /t=0. However, the correlation increases with\nincreasing temperature and then decreases toward high\ntemperature. This anomalous increase of the correlation\nis a manifestation of the evolution to the two-dimensional\nelectronic states. Moreover, we have found an anomalous\nchange of the kinetic energy perpendicular to the stripe.\nAll of these characteristic phenomena of the stripe phase\nappear in a realistic temperature region, i.e., T < J. The\nfact that characteristic temperatures such as Tm defined\nin Fig. 6(b) depend not only on the stripe potential V\nbut also on J suggests that the ordering of spins plays an\nimportant role in the confinement of holes in the charge\nstripe. The disordering of spins due to the thermal fluctuation destroys the charge stripe and makes the crossover\nfrom the one-dimensional electronic states to the twodimensional ones.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank P.
