Introduction\nSince 1999, a radial velocity survey of 179 red giant stars is ongoing at Lick Observatory, using the\n60 cm Coud\u00e9 Auxiliary Telescope (CAT) in conjunction with the Hamilton echelle spectrograph\n(R \u2248 60 000). These stars have been selected from the Hipparcos catalogue [2], based on the\ncriteria described by [3]. The selected stars are all brighter than 6 mag, are presumably single\nand have photometric variations < 0.06 mag in V. The system with an iodine cell in the light\npath has been developed as described by [9] and [12]. With integration times of up to thirty\nminutes for the faintest stars (mv = 6 mag) we reach a signal to noise ratio of about 80 \u2212 100\nat \u03bb = 5500 \u00c5, yielding a radial velocity precision of 5 \u2212 8 m s\u22121 .\nThe initial aim of the survey was to check whether red giants would be stable enough to serve\nas reference stars for astrometric observations with SIM/PlanetQuest [3]. In [6] it is shown that\na large fraction of the red giants in a specific part of the absolute magnitude vs. B-V colour\ndiagram are stable to a level of 20 m s\u22121 and could be effectively searched for long period\ncompanions, as is required for astrometric reference stars. For other stars in the sample the\nradial velocity variations are larger, and for 43 stars these show significant periodicities. So far,\nsub-stellar companions have been announced for two stars from the present sample (\u03b9 Dra [4]\nand \u03b2 Gem [10]).\nHere, we investigate which physical mechanism causes the observed radial velocity variations.\nIn cases for which we do not find a significant periodicity in the observed radial velocity\n\n\fFigure 1.

The black dots indicate the stars with periodic radial velocity variations (stellar\nbinaries are excluded), and the red squares indicate stars with random radial velocity variations.\nThe solid line is the best fit through the random stars, the dotted line indicates the 1\u03c3 interval\naround the best fit and the dashed line indicates the 3\u03c3 interval. Six of the 8 stars with periodic\nradial velocity variations and log g < 1.6 are classified bright giants or supergiants [2].\n\nvariations, an intrinsic mechanism such as spots or pulsations, possibly multi-periodic, seems\nmost likely. On the other hand, the periodic radial velocity variations can be caused by substellar companion, an intrinsic mechanism, or by both these mechanisms simultaneously. In\nSection 2 we search for a relation between the amplitude of the radial velocity variations and\nan intrinsic parameter, i.e. log g. In Section 3 we investigate line shape variations and compare\nthese with theoretical predictions. Our conclusions are presented in Section 4. A more extended\npaper on this subject is submitted [8].\n2. Radial velocity amplitude vs. surface gravity relation\nHatzes and Cochran 1998 [5] already investigated the origin of the observed radial velocities in\nK giant stars. Although their sample contained only 9 stars, they suggested that the amplitude\nof the radial velocity increases with decreasing surface gravity. In lower surface gravity it takes\nlonger to decrease the velocity of a moving parcel which results in larger amplitudes and the\nrelation suggested by [5] would therefore be evidence for an intrinsic mechanism for these long\nperiod radial velocity variations.\nFor the present sample, log g values were determined spectroscopically by [7], by imposing\n\n\fFigure 2. Half of the peak-to-peak variation of the radial velocity as a function of surface\ngravity (log g) as in Figure 1, but showing only those stars with periodic radial velocity variations\n(dots) and their residual (plus). The solid line indicates the linear fit through the stars with\nnon-periodic radial velocity variations (from Figure 1).\n\nexcitation and ionisation equilibrium of iron lines through stellar models. The equivalent width\nof about two dozen carefully selected iron lines were used for a spectroscopic LTE analysis based\non the 2002 version of MOOG [11] and Kurucz model atmospheres which include overshoot\neffects [1]. These authors estimated the error on log g to be 0.22 dex from the scatter found in a\ncomparison with literature values. A detailed description of the stellar parameters for individual\nstars and a comparison with literature values are available in [7] and is therefore omitted here.\nIn Figure 1 the half peak-to-peak value of the radial velocity is plotted as a function of log g,\ntogether with the best linear fit. There clearly exists a correlation between the observed radial\nvelocity amplitude variation and the surface gravity. Also, most of the stars with periodic radial\nvelocity variations and log g > 1.6 dex are located above the best fit, which could indicate that\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms are contributing. To investigate this, we subtracted\nthe periodic fit from the radial velocity variations and plotted half the peak-to-peak value of\nthe residuals as a function of surface gravity, see Figure 2. For stars with log g > 1.6 dex the\nresiduals are now located around the best fit through the random stars. This is an indication\nthat intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms are indeed contributing simultaneously in these stars.\nFor 8 out of 9 stars with log g < 1.6 dex, we find a significant period and therefore, the best\nfit in Figure 1 may not be very accurate in this region. Furthermore, the atmospheres of stars\nwith these low surface gravities are so diluted that instabilities occur easily, either periodic or\n\n\fFigure 3.

Right: the\nresidual of the Fe I line at 6252.57 \u00c5, taken at different epochs (indicated with different line\nstyles), with respect to a time averaged profile, as a function of wavelength.

We therefore think it most likely that these variations are not due to companions.\nMoreover, the radial velocity variations of these stars are located around the fit for random\nvariables, while the residuals are mostly below this relation.\n3. Line shape analysis\nIn the previous section we treated a sample of stars, but we would also like to know what\nmechanism causes the radial velocity variations in each star individually. For a sub-sample of\nstars, we therefore obtained high resolution spectra (R \u2248 164 000) with the SARG spectrograph\nmounted on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, La Palma, Spain. We have between 3 and 8\nobservations per star, which is not enough to do a full line shape analysis. But we tried to\nidentify whether significant line depth variation is present in a star, which would indicate an\nintrinsic mechanism. To do this we shifted the spectra of each star, taken at different epochs,\nto the laboratorium wavelength and computed a time averaged profile. Residuals at each epoch\nprovides us with the variation in line depth which is indicative of line shape variations and thus\nthe presence of an intrinsic mechanism.\nIn Figure 3 we show the radial velocity variation of HIP53261 as a function of phase and the\nresiduals of the line depth. For this star we see significant variation in the line depth, which is\nindicative of an intrinsic mechanism. Because we lack data to perform a frequency analysis it is\nnot yet possible to verify whether the period of the radial velocity and line depth variation are\nrelated, in which case the variations are due to an intrinsic mechanism. In case the periods are\nnot related, we probably have a companion orbiting an intrinsically active star.\nApart from the relation in frequency between the radial velocity and line depth variations\nwe are also interested in the possible existence of a correlation between the amplitudes of\nboth variations. Because the stars show hardly any photometric variation, spots similar to\nsunspots are not the most likely mechanism and therefore we focus here on stellar pulsations.\nWe computed the half peak-to-peak value of the first moment (another diagnostic for the radial\nvelocity) and residuals in line depth for line profiles with pulsation modes l = 0, 1, 2 and positive\nm values, inclination angles of 30, 50 and 70 degrees, projected rotational velocities of 2.0, 3.5\n\n\fFigure 4. Half peak-to-peak values of the\nfirst moment as a function of residuals in\nline depth for stars with pulsations with\nl = (0, 1, 2), positive m values (different\nmodes are indicated with different symbols).\nTop: for inclination angles of 30, 50 and\n70 degrees, projected rotational velocity of\n2.0, 3.5 and 5.0 km s\u22121 , equivalent width of\n30, 40 and 50 km s\u22121 , intrinsic line width\nof 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 km s\u22121 and pulsation\namplitudes of 0.1 and 1.0 km s\u22121 .

From these plots it is clear that there is no simple relation between the amplitude in\nthe radial velocity and residual line depth variations. To investigate the influence of different\nparameters, we also plotted the first moment amplitude as a function of residual line depth for\nall modes and both pulsation amplitudes, and vary one parameter, while keeping three other\nparameters fixed (Figure 4). In this way it becomes clear that the projected rotational velocity,\nintrinsic line width and equivalent width of a line introduces variations in the line residuals at\napproximately the same value for the first moment. On the other hand, varying the inclination\nangle or pulsation velocity changes the amplitude of the first moment (radial velocity variation)\nat approximately the same residual line width.\nIn Figure 5 we show the observed half peak-to-peak values of the radial velocity variation as\na function of the residual line depth variation, for all stars with at least 3 high resolution, high\nsignal to noise observations with SARG. There is no correlation between these points, which is\nas expected from the theoretical analysis for stars with different parameters. Strikingly, most\nof the observed points fall in a region where no theoretical values are found. This difference\nbetween the observations and computations can be caused by the fact that in the theoretical\nmodels the temperature variation of the stellar surface due to oscillations is not taken into\naccount. This temperature variation causes variations in the intrinsic and equivalent width of\n\n\fthe spectral line and these parameters have a large influence on the amplitude of the residual\nline depth. This effect could cause the higher amplitudes in the observed line depth residuals\nthan expected from the calculations. In case the input values chosen for the models are too far\noff the actual values of the pulsation parameters of the stars, we would also expect a discrepancy\nbetween the observed and computed relation between radial velocity variations and residual line\ndepth.\n4. Conclusions\nThere exists a clear correlation between the half peak-to-peak values of the radial velocity\nvariations and the surface gravity of the red giant stars. This is a strong indication that the\nobserved radial velocity variations are caused by a mechanism intrinsic to the star. Companions\nand an intrinsic mechanism might be present in stars with periodic radial velocity variations\nand log g > 1.6 dex, while for stars with log g < 1.6 dex solely an intrinsic mechanism seems\nmost likely.\nWe have investigated whether there is a relation between the radial velocity amplitude and the\namplitude of the line depth residuals. From theory we find that the rotational velocity, intrinsic\nand equivalent line width largely influence the line depth residual and no clear correlation could\nbe identified.\nIn the theoretical models temperature variations due to the pulsations is ignored, but these\ntemperature variations influence the intrinsic and equivalent line width of the spectral line, which\ninfluences the line depth residuals. This might be an explanation why the theoretical models do\nnot overlap with the observations.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\nCastelli F, Gratton R G and Kurucz R L 1997 A&A 526 432\nPerryman M A C and ESA 1997 ESA Special Publication 1200\nFrink S, Quirrenbach A, Fischer D A, R\u00f6ser S and Schildbach E 2001 PASP 113 173-87\nFrink S, Mitchell D S, Quirrenbach A, Fischer D A, Marcy G W and Butler R P 2002 ApJ 576 478-84\nHatzes A P and Cochran W D 1998 Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series 154 311\nHekker S, Reffert S, Quirrenbach A, Mitchell D S, Fischer D A, Marcy G W and Butler R P 2006 A&A 454\n943-9\nHekker S and Mel\u00e9ndez J 2007 A&A in press\nHekker S, Snellen I A G, Aerts C, Quirrenbach A, Reffert S and Mitchell D S 2007 A&A submitted\nMarcy G W and Butler R P 1992 PASP 104 270-7\nReffert S, Quirrenbach A, Mitchell D S, Albrecht S, Hekker S, Fischer D A, Marcy G W and Butler R P\n2006 Apj 652 661-5\nSneden C A 1973 PhD thesis\nValenti J A, Butler R P and Marcy G W 1995 PASP 107 966\n\n\f"}
