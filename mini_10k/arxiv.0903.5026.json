The universality rules state\nthat the critical exponents depend only on a small number of basic parameters1 , essentially the dimension of\nspace D, the range of interaction, and the number of\norder parameter components n. Physically, the critical\nparameters should not depend on the details of the short\nrange interactions. The few known and well understood\nexceptions to universality concern mainly rare marginal\ncases, such as certain regularly frustrated spin systems\nin two dimensions where critical exponents vary continuously with the value of a control parameter. It should\nalso be kept in mind that if the specific heat exponent \u03b1 is\npositive for pure ferromagnets, disorder induces another\nuniversality class2 .\nThe glass transition in structural glasses has long\nraised fundamental questions. It has been hoped that\nthe study of spin glass (SG) transitions would give insight\ninto the basic physics of glassy ordering. In particular, a\nnatural assumption to make is that universality rules hold\nin SGs, with exponents which are different from those of\nferromagnets but which do not depend on the detailed\nform of the interactions between spins.\nFor technical and conceptual reasons the SG transition should be much easier to study than structural glass\nfreezing but it has turned out that SG transitions also\npose major problems. It has proved impossible so far to\nextend RGT satisfactorily to dimensions below the upper\ncritical dimension, so information on transitions comes\nfrom experiment and the large scale numerical simulations which can be carried out on SGs. Numerous numerical studies on Ising Spin Glasses (ISGs) have concluded\nthat universality holds also for these systems. However,\ndetermining transition temperatures and critical exponents to high precision at SG transitions through simulations remains a notoriously difficult task. Problems that\n\nare intrinsic to the numerical simulations include agonizingly slow equilibration rates near criticality and the\nneed to average over a large number of microscopically\ninequivalent samples. It is helpful to analyze the numerical data using appropriate scaling variables and scaling\nrules3 , and above all it is essential to allow adequately\nfor corrections to finite size scaling (FSS).\n\nHere we address once again the case of the Ising\nspin glass with bimodal (\u00b1J) interactions in dimension\nthree (3D), a system which has already been the subject of many numerical studies. Recent careful measurements4,5,6,7 , where samples of sizes up to L = 24, 20, 24\nand L = 28 respectively were studied, all give estimates\nof the critical temperature consistent with Tc \u223c 1.12(1).\nIn the present work equilibrium measurements have been\nmade for sample sizes up to twice as large as those studied in most of the previous work. The data demonstrate\nthat in this system the influence of finite-size corrections\nto scaling extends to very large sizes, strongly affecting\nthe thermodynamic limit estimate of the ordering temperature and therefore those of the critical exponents in\nthis system. An analysis of these equilibrium data allowing for the corrections suggests a higher critical temperature, compatible with estimations from a \"dynamic\" approach8,9,10 . As a corollary the critical exponents will be\nsignificantly different from those obtained with Tc \u223c 1.12,\nas in Ref. 4,5,6,7.\n\nOur principal conclusion is that the present large size\ndata for the 3D Bimodal ISG taken together with published data for the 3D Gaussian ISG where corrections\nappear to be much weaker (Ref. 6) cannot be read as evidence that the two systems lie in the same universality\nclass.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nMEASUREMENTS AND ANALYSIS\n\nWe measure as usual the reduced spin-glass susceptibility \u03c7(T, L) defined as\n1\n\u03c7(T, L) = 3\nL\n\n*\n\nX\n\n(1) (2)\nSi Si\n\ni\n\n!2 +\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere h* * *i represents thermal and disorder average, and\nthe upper suffix denotes two real replicas of the model\nwith identical bond configurations. Using the spin overlap given by\nq=\n\n1 X (1) (2)\nS S ,\nL3 i i i\n\n(2)\n\nthe spin-glass susceptibility is also expressed as \u03c7 =\nL3 hq 2 i. We also measure finite-size correlation length11 ,\n\u03be(T, L) =\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n\u03c7\u0303(0)\n\u22121\n2 sin(\u03c0/L) \u03c7\u0303(kmin )\n\n\u00151/2\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c7\u0303(k) is the Fourier transformed spin-glass susceptibility with wave vector k and kmin = (2\u03c0/L, 0, 0).\nThis becomes identical to the second moment correlation\nlength in the thermodynamic limit L \u226b \u03be(\u221e, T ).\nPublished estimates of critical exponents on specific\nISGs have varied widely (see the list in Ref. 6) and it is\nof interest to examine the reasons for this dispersion. In\nmost work FSS analyses are carried out on measurements\nmade at equilibrium on small to moderate sized samples;\nthe sizes L, the number of independent samples, and the\nequilibration times were necessarily restricted by computer time limitations. The ordering temperature Tc is\ngenerally estimated by the intersection temperature of\ncurves for the Binder parameter given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\nhq 4 i\n1\n3\u2212 2 2\n(4)\ng(L, T ) =\n2\nhq i\nor of the normalized correlation length \u03be(L, T )/L as these\ntwo observables become independent of size at the ordering temperature, to within FSS corrections. This caveat\nis vital because for the sizes which can be equilibrated\nin practice FSS corrections are often not negligible and\nit is hard to extrapolate precisely from data on a set of\nfinite L samples to the thermodynamic (infinite L) limit\nbecause, in contrast to the situation in standard ferromagnets, there are no firm guidelines as to the form of\nthe corrections at and close to criticality. We will return\nto this crucial point below.\nOnce Tc has been estimated the critical exponents \u03bd\nand \u03b7 (with \u03b3 = (2 \u2212 \u03b7)\u03bd) have generally been estimated through a standard FSS analysis on the Binder\nparameter, the normalized correlation length, and the\nreduced susceptibility \u03c7(L, T ) : g(L, T ) = Fg [L1/\u03bd (T \u2212\nTc )], \u03be(L, T )/L = F\u03be [L1/\u03bd (T \u2212 Tc )] and \u03c7(L, T ) =\nL2\u2212\u03b7 F\u03c7 [L1/\u03bd (T \u2212 Tc )]. These rules, which have been\n\ntaken over directly from the usage in ferromagnet studies, implicitly assume that the appropriate temperature\nscaling variable is [(T \u2212Tc)/Tc ]. In a ferromagnet the coupling strength is J and so reduced field and temperature\nscales are H/J and T /J. In a SG the effective coupling\nstrength parameter is hJ 2 i not J and it is the non-linear\nsusceptibility, not the linear susceptibility, which diverges\nat criticality. Hence the appropriate \"field\" and \"temperature\" variables are H 2 /hJ 2 i and T 2 /hJ 2 i rather than\nH/J and T /J (see Refs. 12,13,14,15). We have shown3\nthat it is useful for SGs to employ \"extended scaling\"\nrules which (writing \u03b2 = 1/T ) make the leading approximations\n\u0003\u2212\u03bd\n\u0002\n(5)\n\u03be(\u221e, \u03b2) \u223c \u03b2 1 \u2212 (\u03b2/\u03b2c )2\nand\n\n\u03c7(\u221e, \u03b2) \u223c [1 \u2212 (\u03b2/\u03b2c )2 ]\u2212\u03b3\n\n(6)\n\nThese reduce to the standard forms in the limit (T \u2212\nTc )/Tc \u226a 1, and they also lead to the functionally correct forms in the high temperature limit. They become\nexact at all T > Tc in the high dimension limit, but\ncorrection terms are to be expected in finite dimensions.\nWhen these scaling expressions are used, estimates for\nthe exponents derived from scaling data on the different\nobservables over wide temperature ranges are considerably more consistent than when the traditional rules are\nused to analyze the same data sets (see Ref. 6 where the\ntwo analyses are compared). The traditional expressions\nreduce to the SG expressions very close to criticality, but\nif they are used to scale data covering a wider range of T\nthey tend to strongly bias estimates of \u03bd. Consequently,\nprevious works did not provide a consistent estimation\nof \u03bd that should be independent of physical quantities.\nThis remark in itself explains why estimates of \u03bd in older\npublications were systematically very low compared to\nmore recent values6 .\nThere remains the basic technical problem of determining of an adequate sample size such that corrections\nto FSS have become negligible. Sizes L cannot be increased at will because equilibration at and near Tc becomes rapidly more difficult with increasing L, leading\nto escalating cost in computer time. We have chosen a\nstrategy which sidesteps this problem by appealing to the\nfinite-size ratio scaling approach introduced by Caracciolo et al 16 , and already applied to the 3D bimodal\nISG by Palassini and Caracciolo17. For each observable\nQ(L, T ) the ratio Q(sL, T )/Q(L, T ) is plotted against the\nnormalized correlation length \u03be(L, T )/L. In practice we\nscale with s = 2 and so plot the ratios Q(2L, T )/Q(L, T ),\nwith Q = \u03be, \u03c7 and g. In the limit of sufficiently large L\nwhere finite size corrections to scaling have become negligible, for each observable Q(L, T ) all the scaled data must\nfall on a single curve characteristic of the universality\nclass of the system16 . In this limit \u03be(2L, Tc )/\u03be(L, Tc) and\ng(2L, Tc)/g(L, Tc) are equal to 2 and 1 respectively when\n\u03be(L, T )/L is equal to its critical value.

The important point is that if already the\nscaled data do not lie on a single L-independent curve at\ntemperatures somewhat above Tc , then finite size corrections to scaling are still important for the sizes studied\nand the thermodynamic limit has not yet been reached.\nBecause of the high value of the dynamical exponent\nz(Tc ) in ISGs (z(Tc ) is typically \u223c 6 in 3D) it is technically much faster to equilibrate large samples down to say\n1.2Tc so as to judge if corrections to scaling have become\nnegligible rather than going to temperatures down to and\nbelow Tc . The only drawback of this approach is that one\nneeds to make an extrapolation in temperature (as well\nas in size) in order to estimate Tc , the critical exponents,\nand the large size universal parameters \u03be(L, Tc )/L and\ng(L, Tc ).\nCubic lattices of linear size L = 3 to L = 48 with\nbimodal random interactions with equal probability and\nconventional periodic boundary conditions were equilibrated using the exchange Monte-Carlo technique18 . The\nnumber of independent samples studied were : 4000,\n4000, 4000, 8192, 8192, 6144, 1024, 2688 and 512 for\nL = 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32 and 48, respectively. Samples up to L = 16 were equilibrated down to T = 0.9; in\norder to avoid the difficulties associated with excessive\nequilibration times at the lowest temperatures for large\nsamples with L = 24, 32, it was decided to equilibrate\nonly down to T = 1.1 and 1.2 respectively. Two independent batches of 256 L = 48 samples were equilibrated\ndown to T = 1.3 and to T = 1.4. As discussed above, for\nthese large sizes this approach avoids the region below\nthe ordering temperature where equilibration is particularly hard to achieve. The observables recorded were the\nspin-glass susceptibility \u03c7(L, T ), the finite size correlation length \u03be(L, T ), the Binder parameter g(L, T ), and\nthe energy per spin e(L, T ). Equilibration was checked\nby studying the dependence of the observables on the\nmeasurement time. Wherever direct comparisons could\nbe made, i.e. for sizes up to L = 24, there was excellent point by point agreement between the present long\ntime anneal values and equilibrated data from an independent study (Ref. 6 and Helmut Katzgraber, private\ncommunication), confirming that equilibrium had been\nreached.\nThe data were analyzed using the Caracciolo et al16 finite size ratio scaling approach. Figures 1 and 2 show the\nratio scaling plots for the correlation length \u03be(L, T ). In\norder to be able to visualize the non-monotonic behavior\nwe present the data in two scaling plots. It can be seen\nthat for small L the scaling curves move systematically\nfrom left to right with increasing L; then as L is increased\nfurther beyond L \u223c 24 the curves begin to move to the\nleft again. By inspection the present data demonstrate\nthat in the 3D bimodal ISG there are significant finitesize corrections to scaling up to and probably beyond the\nlargest sizes which we have studied; the observed non-\n\n1.6\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n(L,T)/L\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Scaling plot for correlation length ratios \u03be(2L, T )/\u03be(L, T ) against \u03be(L, T )/L following Ref. 16.\nTop to bottom L = 24, 16, 12 black, red, green.\n\nmonotonic behavior of the scaling plots as functions of L\nimplies that there are at least two important and conflicting correction terms.

Again for small L the\n\ncurves move systematically to the right with increasing\nL, and then begin to move to the left for larger L. Once\nmore the position of the infinite L limit curve is difficult to judge but it would correspond to a value for the\nexponent \u03b7 less negative than that suggested by recent\nestimates6,7 . Figure 5 shows a ratio scaling plot for the\nBinder parameter g(L, T ). Again similar behavior can be\nobserved.

This form of\nscaling plot is very insensitive to corrections to scaling\nbecause g(L, T ) and \u03be(L, T )/L are closely correlated.\nComparisons have been made between different spin\nglasses using this form of scaling plot (e.g. Ref. 6)\nbecause systems lying in different universality classes\nshould not have the same scaling curves. However simple\ninspection of figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 shows that g(L, T ) remains an almost unique function of \u03be(L, T )/L even when\nstrong finite size corrections to scaling are obvious in the\nratio scaling plots for each of the two parameters taken\nindividually. In other words the corrections to scaling for\ng(L, T ) and for \u03be(L, T )/L are strongly correlated. Because this particular form of scaling is very insensitive to\ncorrections, using such plots to judge if two systems lie\nin the same universality class or not would require data\nof extremely high statistical precision.\nAs an illustration, ratio data are shown as functions\nof L in figures 7, 8 and 9 for one fixed normalized\ncorrelation length value, \u03be(L, T )/L = 0.393. The figures demonstrate the non-monotonic behavior, and also\nthe difficulty in extrapolating to infinite L when aiming to estimate the limiting ratio values, even at temperatures well above criticality. If nevertheless we assume that the \u03be(48, T )/\u03be(24, T ) ratio curve is close to\nthe infinite size limit, and we extrapolate the curve to\n\u03be(48, T )/\u03be(24, T ) = 2 we obtain Tc \u223c 1.175, which in\nview of the extrapolations we have been obliged to make\ncan be considered as a lower limit to the true value of Tc .\nWe recall that a quite independent \"dynamic\" estimate9\ngives Tc \u223c 1.19. This value is consistent with the present\nequilibrium analysis.\nIt is important to envisage potential sources of sys-\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\nFIG. 8: Susceptibility ratios \u03c7(2L, T )/\u03c7(L, T ) against L for\n\u03be(L, T )/L = 0.393.\n\n0.88\n\n0.86\n\n0.84\n\n0.82\n\n0.80\n\ng(2L)/g(L)\n\nFIG. 7: Correlation length ratios \u03be(2L, T )/\u03be(L, T ) against L\nfor \u03be(L, T )/L = 0.393.\n\n14\n\nL\n\n0.78\n\n0.76\n\n0.74\n\n0.72\n\n0.70\n\n0.68\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\nL\n\nFIG. 9: Binder parameter ratios g(2L, T )/g(L, T ) against L\nfor \u03be(L, T )/L = 0.393.\n\ntematic error in the present data. Even though stringent\nprecautions have been taken to assure full equilibration,\nas always with spin glass simulations a possible source of\nerror which must be kept in mind would be incomplete\nequilibration. As stated above, the data for sizes up to\nL = 24 are in very good agreement with those from reliable independent studies(Ref. 6 and Helmut Katzgraber,\nprivate communication). It should be noted that a lack of\nequilibration for the larger samples only (L = 48 and L =\n32) would reduce \u03be(2L, T ) and \u03c7(2L, T ) for L = 24 and\nL = 16 while leaving \u03be(L, T ), \u03c7(L, T ) and \u03be(L, T )/L un-\n\n\f6\naltered, and so would artificially move the scaling curves\nof Figures 2 and 4 downwards. The observation that\nthe curves for \u03be(48, T )/\u03be(24, T ) and \u03be(32, T )/\u03be(16, T ) in\nthese two figures lie well above the others thus cannot be\nan artifact arising from lack of equilibration at L = 48\nand L = 32. There remain of course purely statistical\nsampling effects due to the fact that at large sizes the\nnumber of samples studied is necessarily restricted. For\nthe sizes L = 48 and L = 32 the only data with which\ncomparisons could be made are those from the pioneering\nwork of Ref. 17; these are fragmentary and recorded on\nfar fewer samples than in the present work, but within the\nstatistical errors there is agreement, particularly for the\ntwo L = 48 points from 64 samples recorded by Ref. 17.\nFor the 3D Gaussian ISG, corrections to scaling are\nmuch very weaker than in the bimodal case6 , so it can\nplausibly be assumed that the estimates for Tc and for\nthe critical values of \u03be(L, T )/L and g(L, T ) from the\nlargest L Gaussian ISG data6 can be taken as being essentially equal to the infinite size thermodynamic limit\nvalues. Unless strong corrections appear when still larger\nL Gaussian samples are studied, the Gaussian critical\nparameters in the thermodynamic limit are not equal to\nthose for the thermodynamic limit bimodal ISG derived\nas outlined above, implying that the two systems do not\nlie in the same universality class.\nIII.\n\nFINITE-SIZE CORRECTIONS TO SCALING\n\nClearly it is essential to allow for corrections to scaling\nin order to obtain reliable estimates of the critical parameters. At criticality FSS expressions including correction\nterms can be written as (see for instance Ref. 19)\n\u03c7(L, \u03b2c ) = C\u03c7 L2\u2212\u03b7 [1 + a1 L\u2212\u03c9 + a2 L\u2212\u03c92 + . . .]\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c9 and \u03c92 are the first and second correction exponents. For standard ferromagnets these exponents\nare rather accurately known from RGT; in dimension 3\n\u03c9 \u223c 0.51 and \u03c92 \u223c 0.82 in pure systems and \u03c9 \u223c 0.3 and\n\u03c92 \u223c 0.8 19 for diluted ferromagnets. Unfortunately there\nare no equivalent RGT guide-lines for the values of the\ncorrection exponents (and a fortiori for the strengths of\nthe correction terms) in ISGs. The non-monotonic variation of the positions of the scaling curves with increasing\nL in the 3D bimodal ISG implies that there are two significant contributions (at least) with opposite signs to\nthe finite-size-scaling corrections, coming from \u03c9 and \u03c92\nterms.\nFor finite-size scaling with corrections near Tc , Calbrese et al 20 give the ansatz\n\u03be(2L, T )/\u03be(L, T ) = F (L/\u03be(L, T )) + L\u2212\u03c9 G(L/\u03be(L, T ))\n(8)\n\n1\n\nS.K. Ma, Modern Theory of Critical Phenomena, (Benjamin, New York, 1976)\n\nand the equivalent equation for \u03c7, where F and G are\nscaling functions and \u03c9 is the leading non-analytic correction to scaling exponent. Unfortunately the present\ndata are manifestly insufficient to attempt fits to analogous equations with two correction terms, so we can\nmake no sensible estimate of the correction exponents in\nthe 3D bimodal ISG.\nIt can be noted that in the 2d Bimodal ISG (which\norders only at T = 0) limiting behavior at criticality is\nonly attained above L \u223c 10021 .\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEquilibrium numerical data on the three dimensional\nbimodal Ising spin glass for samples up to size L = 48\nshow that corrections to finite-size scaling are unexpectedly strong and non-monotonic. Taking into account the\ninfluence of these corrections, it can be concluded that\nthe large size limit behavior and the corresponding thermodynamic limit critical temperature and critical parameters are significantly different from the values derived\nfrom previous equilibrium simulation data where smaller\nmaximum sizes were studied. Estimates of critical parameters from the present data are only indicative due to\nthe intrinsic problem of extrapolating reliably to infinite\nsize, but they are consistent with those obtained from\na \"dynamic\" method8,9,10 . The strong corrections to finite size scaling must be fully taken into account before\na valid comparison can be made between the thermodynamic limit behaviors for the bimodal and Gaussian 3D\nISGs. The data as they exist cannot be considered to\nshow that the two systems lie in the same universality\nclass.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Helmut Katzgraber for generously making his numerical data available to us, and for\nnumerous helpful comments.
