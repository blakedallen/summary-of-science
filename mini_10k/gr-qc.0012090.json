All these\npotentials undergo linear transformations when the group of charging symmetries acts.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA successful choice of the variables often plays the crucial role in the study of a nonlinear\ntheory. The most powerful tools for this study are related to use of the symmetry methods. A form of the finite symmetry transformations depends on the variables choice; the\nsimplest and the most convenient symmetry representation has the linear form. This form\nallows one to deal with the general group transformation and to obtain the results which\ncannot be generalized again by the help of additional transformations from this symmetry\ngroup. In contrast to this situation, often in real practice one needs in the series of special\ntransformations to obtain more or less general result in the case of the nonlinear symmetry\nrepresentation. Moreover, at the end of this step\u2013by\u2013step special symmetry applications it\nis necessary to establish what kind of generality had been obtained.\nIn this paper we continue to study the heterotic string theory using the symmetry based\nmethods. At low energies this theory becomes the nonlinear field theory of its massless\nmodes living in the multidimensional space\u2013time [1]. This effective field theory becomes the\nnonlinear \u03c3\u2013model after its compactification to three dimensions on a torus [2]\u2013[3]. Below\nwe develop a new representation for this \u03c3\u2013model based on the use of a single scalar matrix\npotential which has the lowest possible matrix dimension. This scalar matrix potential\ntransforms linearly under the action of the group of charging symmetries, which preserve\ntrivial spatial asymptotics of the all \u03c3\u2013model fields [4]. In fact, this representation provides\nthe compact and convenient tool for the study of asymptotically flat fields and for the\ngeneration of asymptotically flat solutions of the heterotic string theory.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in the next section we \"derive\" one special \u03c3\u2013model\nwhich can be considered as the simplest nonlinear modification of the linear theory, possessing\nthe same charging symmetry group of transformations. Both the linear and the nonlinear\n\u03c3\u2013models are given in terms of the single scalar nonquadratic matrix potential. In the\nnext section we show how the same nonlinear \u03c3\u2013model arises in the framework of heterotic\nstring theory. After that, in the next section, we establish the relation between our and\nchiral matrix formalisms. In fact we express the chiral matrix in terms of the \"main\" scalar\nmatrix potential found in the previous section. Finally, in the last section, starting from the\nconserving chiral current we construct on shell three pairs of the scalar and vector matrix\npotentials defined in terms of the \"main\" scalar matrix potential. It is shown that all these\nscalar and vector potentials transform linearly under the action of charging symmetry group\nof transformations. In \"Conclusions\" we discuss the results obtained and their possible\napplications to the problem of generation of new exact solutions of the heterotic string\ntheory.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\n\u03c3\u2013model derivation\n\nLet us consider a class of \u03c3\u2013models possessing two commuting groups of symmetry transformations isomorphic to O(p1, q1 ) and O(p2 , q2 ) as the \"underlying\" symmetry. Let us choose\nthe real matrix potential Z of the dimension (p1 +q1 )\u00d7(p2 +q2 ) as the dynamical variable for\nthese \u03c3\u2013models. Then, the underlying symmetry can be realized as the linear transformation\nZ \u2192 C1 ZC2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nCaT \u03a3a Ca = \u03a3a ,\n\na = 1, 2,\n\n(2)\n\nand \u03a3a are the diagonal matrices with pa \"+1\" and qa \"\u22121\" on their main diagonals. Thus,\nCa \u2208 O(pa, qa ), where a = 1, 2.\nOur class of \u03c3\u2013models is not empty; the Lagrangian of its simplest representative has the\nform\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nL0 = K T r \u03a31 \u2207Z \u03a32 \u2207Z T ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere K = const. This simplest theory is linear, its Euler\u2013Lagrange equation is the Laplace\nequation for the matrix potential Z:\n\u22072 Z = 0.\n\n(4)\n\nA set of the nonlinear modifications of the theory (3) can be obtained using the replacement\n\u03a3a \u2192 \u03a3\u0302\u22121\na , where the matrix fields \u03a3\u0302a (Z) must transform accordingly to the relations\n\u03a3\u03021 \u2192 C1 \u03a3\u03021 C\u02c61T\n\nand\n\n\u03a3\u03022 \u2192 C2T \u03a3\u03022 C\u02c62\n\n(5)\n\nwhen the transformation (1)\u2013(2) acts. In this case the Lagrangian\n\u0010\n\n\u22121\nT\nL = K T r \u03a3\u0302\u22121\n1 \u2207Z \u03a3\u03022 \u2207Z\n\n\u0011\n\n(6)\n\nremains invariant under the action of the transformation (1)\u2013(2), i.e., it belongs to the class\nunder consideration.\nIt is not difficult to establish the explicit realization of the matrix fields \u03a3\u0302a (Z). The\nresult can be expressed in terms of the following formal series:\n\u03a3\u03021 = \u03ba10 \u03a31 + \u03ba11 Z\u03a32 Z T + \u03ba12 Z\u03a32 Z T * \u03a31 * Z\u03a32 Z T + * * * ,\n\u03a3\u03022 = \u03ba20 \u03a32 + \u03ba21 Z T \u03a31 Z + \u03ba22 Z T \u03a31 Z * \u03a32 * Z T \u03a31 Z + * * * .\n3\n\n(7)\n\n\fHere the coefficients \u03baak = \u03baak (Z) (k = 0, 1, ...) are the invariants of the transformation\n(1)\u2013(2); they can be taken as the arbitrary functions of the invariants Il = T r[(\u03a31 Z\u03a32 Z T )l ],\nl = 1, 2, .... Thus, we have obtained the infinite set of the nonlinear \u03c3\u2013models possessing the\n\"underlying\" symmetry.\nNow our main goal is to choose the single special nonlinear \u03c3\u2013model from this set using\nsome additional principles. In fact we must specify the coefficient functions \u03baak (Z). Our\ngeneral principle is the maximal possible similarity between L and L0 , i.e., between the\nnonlinear and the linear \u03c3\u2013models. We suppose, in particular, that L0 is the zero term\nin the expansion of L into the perturbation series with the center at Z = 0. From this\nit follows that \u03baa0 (0) = 1. To obtain more information let us consider the special case of\np1 + q1 = p2 + q2 , when all the matrices under consideration are quadratic. We demand L\ninvariance under the inversion\nZ \u2192 Z \u22121 .\n\n(8)\n\nThis immediately gives \u03baak = const for any k and, hence, \u03baa0 = 1. Moreover, one obtains,\nthat \u03baak = 0 for k \u2265 2, and that \u03ba11 = \u03ba21 = \u03c31 = \u00b11. Also one obtains that \u03a32 = \u03c32 \u03a31 ,\nwhere \u03c32 = \u00b11. The resulting form of the nonlinear Lagrangian L reads:\nL = K Tr\n\n\u0014\u0010\n\n\u03a3 + \u03c3Z\u03a3Z\n\n\u0011\nT \u22121\n\n\u0010\n\nT\n\n\u2207Z \u03a3 + \u03c3Z \u03a3Z\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u2207Z\n\nT\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03a3 = \u03a31 , \u03c3 = \u03c31 \u03c32 = \u00b11 and \u03c31 K is redefined as K. The corresponding form of the\nlinear Lagrangian is\ni\n\nh\n\nL0 = K T r \u03a3\u2207Z\u03a3\u2207Z T .\n\n(10)\n\nIt is easy to see that L0 does not possess the inversion (8) as the symmetry for the arbitrary\nnondegenerated matrix Z. However, if one considers Z restricted by the relation\n\u03a3Z T \u03a3 = c2 Z \u22121 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere c is the arbitrary constant, this symmetry actually takes place. This relation means\nthat c\u22121 Z \u2208 O(p1 , q1 ); the Lagrangians L and L0 calculated on this group subspace read:\nL=\n\ni\nh\nc2 K\n1\n\u22121\n.\nL\n=\nT\nr\n\u2207Z\u2207Z\n0\n(1 + \u03c3c2 )2\n(1 + \u03c3c2 )2\n\n(12)\n\nLet us demand the numerical identity L = L0 on the group subspace (11); it is easy to see\nthat it is possible only in the case of c2 = 2 and \u03c3 = \u22121. This last opportunity fixes the\nsign in Eq. (9) as negative.\n4\n\n\fThe last step is to generalize Eq. (9) with \u03c3 = \u22121 to the case of nonquadratic matrix\npotential Z. We make it in the following natural way:\nL = K Tr\n\n\u0014\u0010\n\n\u03a3 \u2212 Z\u039eZ\n\n\u0011\nT \u22121\n\n\u0010\n\nT\n\n\u2207Z \u039e \u2212 Z \u03a3Z\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u2207Z\n\nT\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\n\u03a3 0\n0 \u03a3\u0303\n\n\u039e=\n\n!\n\n(14)\n\nand \u03a3\u0303 is a diagonal matrix with \u00b11 on the main diagonal. In this generalization we have\nsupposed, for definiteness, that p2 \u2265 p1 and q2 \u2265 q1 ; it is easy to see that in the special case\nof p2 = p1 and q2 = q1 we regress to the special situation considered above.\nThe constructed \u03c3\u2013model is actually nonlinear: its Euler\u2013Lagrange equation can be\nwritten in one of two equivalent forms:\n\u0010\n\n\u22072 Z + 2\u2207Z\u039eZ T \u03a3 \u2212 Z\u039eZ T\nor\n\u0010\n\n\u22072 Z + 2\u2207Z \u039e \u2212 Z T \u03a3Z\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u2207Z = 0\n\n(15)\n\nZ T \u03a3\u2207Z = 0.\n\n(16)\n\nThe matrix field Z is defined under the coordinate space x\u03bc . Our consideration cannot fix\nthe dimensionality and signature of this space\u2013time as well as the value of the parameters\nK, pa and qa . All it will be done in the next section where the \u03c3\u2013model (13) will be used\nfor the representation of the toroidally compactified heterotic string theory.\n\n3\n\n\u03c3\u2013model in heterotic string theory\n\nAt low energies the bosonic sector of heterotic string theory becomes the field theory of its\nmassless modes. These modes live in 3 + d\u2013dimensional space\u2013time (with the coordinates\nX M , M = 1, ..., 3 + d) of the signature \u2212 + * * * + and include the dilaton field \u03a6, the Kalb\u2013\nRamond field BM N = \u2212BN M , the set of n U(1) gauge fields AIM (I = 1, ..., n) and the\nmetric field (graviton) GM N = GN M .

In this case\nthe field components can be classified in respect to transformations of the three\u2013dimensional\ncoordinates x\u03bc \u2261 X d+\u03bc . Namely, one has ([2]\u2013[3]):\n\n1) three scalar matrices G, B and A of the dimensions d \u00d7 d, d \u00d7 d and d \u00d7 n with\nthe components\nGmk , Bmk and AmI = AIm correspondingly, and also the scalar function\n\u221a\n\u03c6 = \u03a6 \u2212 ln \u2212det G;\n\n~ 1, A\n~ 2 and A\n~ 3 of the dimensions d \u00d7 1, d \u00d7 1 and n \u00d7 1; their\n2) three vector columns A\ncomponents read:\n~ 1 )m\u03bc = (G\u22121 )mk Gk,d+\u03bc,\n(A\n~ 2 )m\u03bc = Bm,d+\u03bc \u2212 Bpq (A\n~ 1 )m\u03bc + 1 AmI (A3 )I\u03bc ,\n(A\n2\nI\nI ~\n~\n(A3 )I\u03bc = \u2212Ad+\u03bc + Am (A1 )m\u03bc\n\n(18)\n\nand\n3) two tensor fields\nh\n\ni\n\n~ 1 )m\u03bc (A\n~ 1 )k\u03bd ,\nh\u03bc\u03bd = e\u22122\u03c6 G\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Gmk (A\nh\ni\n~ 1 )m\u03bc (A\n~ 1 )k\u03bd \u2212 1 (A\n~ 1 )m\u03bc (A\n~ 2 )m\u03bd \u2212 (A\n~ 1 )m\u03bd (A\n~ 2 )m\u03bc .\nb\u03bc\u03bd = B\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Bmk (A\n2\n\n(19)\n\nIn three dimensions the field b\u03bc\u03bd is nondynamical; following [3] we put b\u03bc\u03bd = 0 without\ncontradiction with the motion equations. Moreover, in three dimensions it is possible to\nintroduce pseudoscalar fields u, v and s accordingly the relations ([3], [4], [5])\n~ 1 = e2\u03c6 G\u22121 \u2207u + (B + 1 AAT )\u2207v + A\u2207s ,\n\u2207\u00d7A\n2\n1\n~ 1 + A\u2207 \u00d7 A\n~ 3.\n~ 2 = e2\u03c6 G\u2207v \u2212 (B + AAT )\u2207 \u00d7 A\n\u2207\u00d7A\n2\n~ 3 = e2\u03c6 (\u2207s + AT \u2207v) + AT \u2207 \u00d7 A\n~ 1,\n\u2207\u00d7A\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(20)\n\nFinally, the bosonic sector of the heterotic string theory toroidally compactified to three\ndimensions is equivalent on shell to the effective three\u2013dimensional theory which describes\n6\n\n\fthe interacting scalar fields G, B, A and \u03c6 and the pseudoscalar ones u, v and s coupled to\nthe metric h\u03bc\u03bd .\nFor our purposes it is useful to embed all the scalar and pseudoscalar fields into the\nfollowing matrices X and A of the dimensions (d+1)\u00d7(d+1) and (d+1)\u00d7n correspondingly:\nX =\n\n\u2212e\u22122\u03c6 + v T Xv + v T As + 12 sT s v T X \u2212 uT\nXv + u + As\nX\n\n!\n\n,\n\nA=\n\nsT + v T A\nA\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere X = G + B + 21 AAT ([4], [5]). In terms of these matrices the action of the effective\nthree\u2013dimensional theory of heterotic string reads:\nS3 =\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd3 x h {\u2212R3 + L3 } ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1\u0010\nL3 = Tr\n\u2207X \u2212\u2207AAT G \u22121 \u2207X T \u2212A\u2207AT G \u22121 + \u2207AT G \u22121 \u2207A ,\n4\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nG=\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010\nX + X T \u2212 AAT ,\n2\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nh = det h\u03bc\u03bd and the scalar curvature R3 is constructed using the metric h\u03bc\u03bd . This action\ndescribes the nonlinear \u03c3\u2013model coupled to the three\u2013dimensional gravity and has the form\nof the action of the stationary Einstein\u2013Maxwell theory [6]. In Eq. (23) the matrices X and\nA play the same role as the complex Ernst potentials in Einstein\u2013Maxwell theory [7] and\ncan be named as \"matrix Ernst potentials\" [5].\nThe main statement of this chapter is the following: the heterotic string theory \u03c3\u2013model\ngiven by the Lagrangian L3 is the special one from the class of \u03c3\u2013models given by Eq. (13).\nActually, let us put in Eq. (13) K = 1, \u03a3 = diag (\u22121, \u22121, +1, * * * , +1) (two \"\u22121\" and d \u2212 1\n\"+1\" on the main diagonal, so \u03a3 is the (d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1) matrix) and \u03a3\u0303 = 1n (where 1n is\nthe n \u00d7 n unit matrix). Let us also introduce for the (d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1 + n) matrix Z the\nfollowing parametrization:\nZ = (Z1 , Z2 ),\nwhere the (d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1) and (d + 1) \u00d7 n matrices Z1 and Z2 read:\n\u221a\nZ1 = 2 (X + \u03a3)\u22121 \u2212 \u03a3,\nZ2 = 2 (X + \u03a3)\u22121 A\n7\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\n\f(the Einstein\u2013Maxwell analogy of these potentials one can find in [8]). Then, after some\nnontrivial algebraical calculations one can prove that in this special case L = L3 . Thus,\nL3 = Tr\n\n\u0014\u0010\n\n\u03a3 \u2212 Z\u039eZ\n\n\u0011\nT \u22121\n\n\u0010\n\nT\n\n\u2207Z \u039e \u2212 Z \u03a3Z\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u2207Z\n\nT\n\n\u0015\n\n,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere the matrices \u03a3 and \u039e (see Eq. (14)) are defined as it was explained above. We see\nthat the heterotic string theory \u03c3\u2013model can be represented in terms of the matrix potential\nZ. As the straightforward consequence of this fact we conclude (see Eqs. (1)\u2013(2)) that L3\nis invariant under the transformation\n\u2032\n\nZ \u2192 Z = C1 ZC2 ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere the matrices C1 and C2 satisfy the O(2, d \u2212 1) and O(2, d \u2212 1 + n) group relations\nC1T \u03a3C1 = \u03a3 and C2T \u039eC2 = \u039e.\n\n(29)\n\nThen, the matter part of the heterotic string theory equations is given by Eq. (15) or (16),\nwhereas the Einstein equation reads:\nR3 \u03bc\u03bd = Tr\n\n\u0014\u0010\n\n\u03a3 \u2212 Z\u039eZ\n\n\u0011\nT \u22121\n\n\u0010\n\nT\n\n\u2207(\u03bc Z \u039e \u2212 Z \u03a3Z\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u2207\u03bd) Z\n\nT\n\n\u0015\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\nIn [4] it was shown that Eqs. (28)\u2013(29) gives the total group of charging symmetries\nfor the theory under consideration. The charging symmetries form the subgroup of the\ncomplete symmetry group of the \u03c3\u2013model; the transformations from this subgroup preserve\ntrivial values of the all three\u2013dimensional \"matter\" fields. These trivial values are defined\nas the zero ones for the fields B, A, \u03c6, u, v, s and as the d \u00d7 d matrix diag(\u22121, +1, * * * , +1)\nfor G. From the (d + 3)\u2013dimensional point of view this field configuration (together with\nh\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd ) describes the empty Minkowskian space\u2013time in the Carthesian coordinates.\nFrom Eq. (21) it follows that X = \u03a3, A = 0 for the trivial fields and, therefore (see Eqs.\n(25)\u2013(26)), Z = 0 in this case. The zero Z\u2013value is preserved by the transformation (28)\nwith the arbitrary matrices C1 and C2 ; however only the transformation with C1 and C2\nrestricted by the relations (29) belongs to the group of \u03c3\u2013model symmetries.\nA class of the asymptotically flat solutions of the theory under consideration is defined as\nthe class containing all solutions trivial at the spatial infinity [4], [6], [9]. Thus, at the spatial\ninfinity all the solutions from this class become the trivial field configuration discussed above.\nIt is clear that the charging symmetry subgroup contains all the transformations which can\nbe applied for generation of the new asymptotically flat solutions from the known ones. The\n8\n\n\fnoncharging symmetries change the three\u2013dimensional field asymptotics and provide trivial\naction on the solutions; so the charging symmetry subgroup includes all the resultative\nsymmetry transformations. The linear form of the transformation (28) extremely simplifies\nthe solution generation procedure; its straightforward application allows one to obtain the\nmost general possible generation results for the asymptotically flat solutions. To compare\nour solution generation approach with the previously known ones one can use [10].\n\n4\n\nChiral matrix and related structures\n\nAs it has been established above, the effective three\u2013dimensional \u03c3\u2013model of the heterotic\nstring theory compactified on a torus can be represented in two different but algebraically\nrelated forms: in terms of the potential matrix pair X , A and in terms of the single matrix\npotential Z. Now we consider the chiral matrix representation of the same theory, which\ncan be originally given in terms of the pair X , A. Actually, it is easy to prove that the\n[2(d + 1) + n] \u00d7 [2(d + 1) + n] matrix\n\uf8eb\n\nsatisfies the relation\n\n\uf8f6\n\nG \u22121\nG \u22121 X\nG \u22121 A\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nN = \uf8ed X T G \u22121 X T G \u22121 X X T G \u22121 A \uf8f8 ,\nAT G \u22121 AT G \u22121 X AT G \u22121 A\n\n(31)\n\nN LN = 2N ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere the matrix L reads\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nThen the matrix\n\n0 1 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nL = \uf8ed 1 0 0 \uf8f8.\n0 0 \u22121\nM=N \u2212L\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\nsatisfies the relations\nMT LM = L,\n\nMT = M\n\n(35)\n\nwhich mean that M \u2208 O(d + 1, d + 1 + n)/O(d + 1) \u00d7 O(d + 1 + n). The complet list\nof \u03c3\u2013models possessing the matrix representations one can find in [11]. The coset matrix\n9\n\n\frepresentation for the heterotic string theory compactified to three dimensions on a torus\nwas established at the first time by A. Sen in [3]. Our matrix M differs from the Sen's one\nand related to the matrix Ernst potential formulation.\nThe Lagrangian L3 can be rewritten in terms of this coset matrix in the following \"chiral\nform\" ([3], [5]):\n1\nL3 = Tr(J~2 ),\n8\n\n(36)\n\nJ~ = \u2207M M\u22121.\n\n(37)\n\nwhere\n\nFrom this it immediately follows that the total symmetry group for the theory is O(d + 1, d +\n1 + n), because L3 remains invariant under the action of the transformation\n\u2032\n\u02c6\nM \u2192 M = C\u02c6T MC,\n\n(38)\n\nC\u02c6T LC\u02c6 = L,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere\n\ni.e. if C\u02c6 \u2208 O(d + 1, d + 1 + n). The group of charging symmetries forms a subgroup of\nthis total symmetry group; the symmetry matrix C\u02c6 belongs to this subgroup if it preserves\nthe trivial field configuration defined in the previous section. This trivial field configuration\ncorresponds to the matrix\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03a3 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nM0 = \uf8ed 0 \u03a3 0 \uf8f8 ,\n0 0 1\n\n(40)\n\nso the charging symmetry matrix C\u02c6 must satisfy the restriction\nC\u02c6T M0 C\u02c6 = M0\n\n(41)\n\nin addition to the relation (39). Eq. (41) shows that this matrix also belongs to the group\nO(2, 2d + n), so the matrix of the charging symmetry subgroup belongs to the intersection\nof the groups O(d + 1, d + 1 + n) and O(2, 2d + n). We have the explicit realization of this\nsymmetry in terms of the potential Z (see Eqs. (28)\u2013(29)). To obtain its chiral realization\n(in the form of Eq. (38) with C\u02c6 restricted by Eqs. (39) and (41)) it is useful to express\n10\n\n\fthe chiral matrix M in terms of the matrix potential Z. To do it, let us introduce the\n(d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1 + n) matrix\nY = (X , A).\n\n(42)\n\nThen, for the matrix N one has:\nN =\n\nG \u22121\nG \u22121 Y\nY T G \u22121 Y T G \u22121 Y\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(43)\n\nHere the matrix G can also be written by the help of Y:\nG=\n\ni\n1h T\nYl + lY + Y(1 \u2212 lT l)Y T ,\n2\n\n(44)\n\nwhere the matrix\nl = (1 0)\n\n(45)\n\nis constructed from the (d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1) and (d + 1) \u00d7 n blocks. Now one can express the\nmatrices Y and G in terms of the matrix potential Z using Eqs. (25) and (26); the result is:\nY = (\u03a3 + ZlT )\u22121 (l + ZP ),\n\nG = (\u03a3 + ZlT )\u22121 (\u03a3 \u2212 Z\u039eZ T )(\u03a3 + lZ T )\u22121 ,\n\n(46)\n\nwhere\nP =\n\n\u2212\u03a3 \u221a0\n2\n0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(47)\n\nUsing these relations, one establishes that\nN = \u03a8T H \u22121 \u03a8,\n\n(48)\n\nwhere H = \u03a3\u03021 = \u03a3 \u2212 Z\u039eZ T and \u03a8 = \u03a8(Z) is the linear (d + 1) \u00d7 [2(d + 1) + n] matrix\nfunction\n\u03a8 = A + ZB\n\n(49)\n\nwith the proportionality coefficient matrices\nA = (\u03a3, l),\n\nB = (lT , P ).\n11\n\n(50)\n\n\fThus, for the explicit form of M(Z) one obtains:\nM = (A + ZB)T H \u22121 (A + ZB) \u2212 L.\n\n(51)\n\nAs it can be easily verified, the matrices A and B: yield the following remarkable properties:\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n\nALAT = 2\u03a3,\nALBT = 0,\nBLBT = \u22122\u039e.\n\n(52)\n\nNow using them and Eq. (51) we are ready to calculate the matrices C\u02c6a (a = 1, 2) which\ndefine the transformations (38) of the chiral matrix M corresponding to the ones of the\npotential Z given by the matrices Ca (see Eqs. (28) and (29)). Actually, from Eqs. (39) and\n(51) it follows that\nh\n\ni\n\n\u2032\nM = C\u02c6aT (A + ZB)T H \u22121 (A + ZB) \u2212 L C\u02c6a ;\n\n(53)\n\nwhereas from Eqs. (28) and (51) one obtains that\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nM = (A + Z B)T H\n\n\u2032\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2032\n\n(A + Z B) \u2212 L,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere\n\u2032\n\nZ = C1 Z\n\n\u2032\n\nand Z = ZC2\n\n(55)\n\nfor a = 1 and a = 2 correspondingly. From comparison of Eq. (53) and Eqs. (54)\u2013(55) it is\n\u2032\neasy to obtain the relations defining the matrices C\u02c6a . So, for a = 1 one has (H = C1 HC1T )\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n\nBC\u02c61 = B,\nAC\u02c61 = C1\u22121 A,\nC\u02c61T LC\u02c61 = L.\n\n(56)\n\nFrom Eqs. (56-a) and (52-b) it follows that C\u02c61 = 1 + LAT \u03be, where the matrix \u03be = 21 \u03a3(C1\u22121 \u2212\n1)A in view of Eq. (56-b). Thus, the matrix C\u02c61 reads:\n1\nC\u02c61 = 1 + LAT \u03a3(C1\u22121 \u2212 1)A;\n2\n12\n\n(57)\n\n\fthe condition (56-c) is satisfied in view of Eqs. (29) and (52-a). Then, for a = 2 the relations\n\u2032\ndefining C\u02c62 relations read (H = H):\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n\nAC\u02c62 = A,\nBC\u02c62 = C2 B,\nC\u02c62T LC\u02c62 = L.\n\n(58)\n\nFrom Eqs. (58-a) and (52-b) it follows that C\u02c61 = 1+LBT \u03b7, where the matrix \u03b7 = 21 \u039e(1\u2212C2 )B\nin view of Eq. (58-b). Thus, the matrix C\u02c62 reads:\n1\nC\u02c62 = 1 + LBT \u039e(1 \u2212 C2 )B;\n2\n\n(59)\n\nthe condition (58-c) is satisfied in view of Eqs. (29) and (52-c). It is easy to see that from\nEq. (52-b) it also follows that\n[C\u02c61 , C\u02c62 ] = 0,\n\n(60)\n\ni.e., the charging symmetry subgroups '1\u2032 and '2\u2032 commute; this fact also follows from Eq.\n(28) which gives the action of the same subgroups in the Z\u2013representation. Moreover,\nfrom Eqs. 57 and (59) it follows that the matrices A and B provide the transition from\nthe Z\u2013representation to the chiral one for the charging symmetry subgroups '1\u2032 and '2\u2032\ncorrespondingly.\n\n5\n\nVector matrix potentials\n\nIt is possible to express the Lagrangian L3 only in terms of the matrix function \u03a8. Actually,\nusing the relations (52) one can prove that\n1\nH = \u03a8L\u03a8T ,\n2\n\n(61)\n\nM = 2\u03a8T (\u03a8L\u03a8T )\u22121 \u03a8 \u2212 L.\n\n(62)\n\nso\n\nThen, using the relations (35) and (37) it is easy to show that\n~ = 1 \u2212 1 \u03a8T H \u22121 \u03a8L \u2207\u03a8T H \u22121 \u03a8 \u2212 \u03a8T H \u22121\u2207\u03a8 1 \u2212 1 L\u03a8T H \u22121 \u03a8 ,\n~j = JL\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n13\n\n\u0013\n\n(63)\n\n\fand from Eq. (36) for the three\u2013dimensional Lagrangian L3 one obtains:\n1\n1\nL3 = \u2212 Tr \u2207\u03a8 L \u2212 L\u03a8T H \u22121 \u03a8L \u2207\u03a8T T \u22121 .\n2\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\n(64)\n\nNow, using Eqs. (49) and (52) it is easy to check that Eq. (27) actually takes place as the\nconsequence of Eq. (64) and, hence, Eqs. (23) and (36) (it is not difficult to establish the\nequivalence of L3 defined by Eqs. (23) and (36)).\nThen, from Eqs. (38), (39) and (63) it follows that the transformation low for the matrix\ncurrent ~j reads:\n\u02c6\n~j \u2192 ~j \u2032 = C\u02c6T ~j C,\n\n(65)\n\nso it has the same form as the one for the chiral matrix M. The matrix current ~j is\nantisymmetric (~j = \u2207M LM = \u2212ML\u2207M = \u2212~j T ); this property is preserved by the\ntransformation (65). In this section we study the action of the charging symmetry group of\ntransformations on the vector matrix potentials which can be introduced as the potentials\nrelated to the divergence\u2013free vector field ~j.

We would like to extract from \u03a9\nthese potentials in terms of Z and to establish the action of the charging symmetry group\nof transformations on this set.\nTo realize this program let us express the current ~j in terms of the potential Z using\nEqs. (51)\u2013(52); the result reads:\n~j = \u2212AT ~j1 B + BT ~j1T A + AT ~j2 A + BT ~j3 B,\n14\n\n(69)\n\n\fwhere\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n~j1 = H \u22121 \u2207Z \u2212 H \u22121 Z \u039e\u2207Z T \u2212 \u2207Z\u039eZ T H \u22121 Z,\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n~j2 = H \u22121 Z \u039e\u2207Z T \u2212 \u2207Z\u039eZ T H \u22121 ,\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n~j3 = \u2207Z T H \u22121 Z \u2212 Z T H \u22121 \u2207Z + Z T H \u22121 Z\u039e\u2207Z T \u2212 \u2207Z\u039eZ T H \u22121 Z.\n\n(70)\n\nThus, the current ~j is a linear combination of three currents ~ji , i = 1, 2, 3. These currents\nare obviously linear independent and expressed in terms of Z; also they are divergent\u2013free.\nTo prove this fact, let us introduce the 'proection' operators\n1\n\u03a01 = LAT \u03a3\n2\n\nand\n\n1\n\u03a02 = \u2212 LBT \u039e.\n2\n\n(71)\n\nFrom the relations (52) it follows that\nA\u03a01 = 1,\nA\u03a02 = 0,\n\nB\u03a01 = 0,\nB\u03a02 = 1,\n\n(72)\n\nso\n~j1 = \u2212\u03a0T2 ~j\u03a01 ,\n\n~j2 = \u03a0T1 ~j\u03a01 ,\n\n~j3 = \u03a0T2 ~j\u03a02 .\n\n(73)\n\nThus, from Eq. (66) it follows that \u2207~ji = 0. Let us now define three vector matrix potentials\n~ i accordingly the relations\n\u03a9\n~ i = ji ;\n\u2207\u00d7\u03a9\n\n(74)\n\n~ 1, \u03a9\n~ 2 and \u03a9\n~ 3 have the matrix dimensions (d + 1) \u00d7 (d +\nfrom Eq. (70) one concludes that \u03a9\n1 + n), (d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1) and (d + 1 + n) \u00d7 (d + 1 + n) correspondingly.\n~ i are algebraically independent. The action of the group\nThe matrix vector potentials \u03a9\n~ i can be established using Eqs. (57),\nof charging symmetry transformations on the set of \u03a9\n(59) and (68). However, the same result can be easily obtained from Eqs. (28) and (70); it\nreads:\n~1 \u2192 \u03a9\n~ \u2032 = CT\n\u03a9\n1\n1\n\n\u22121 ~\n\n\u03a91 C2 ,\n\n~2 \u2192 \u03a9\n~ \u2032 = CT\n\u03a9\n2\n1\n\n\u22121 ~\n\n\u03a92 C1\u22121 ,\n\n~3 \u2192 \u03a9\n~ \u2032 = CT \u03a9\n~\n\u03a9\n3\n2 3 C2 .\n\n(75)\n\n~ i , and these\nThus, the charging symmetry transformations do not 'mix' the potentials \u03a9\nvector potentials (as well as the scalar one Z) transform as singlets of the group of charging\nsymmetry transformations.\n15\n\n\f~ has the very similar structure in terms of\nNow let us note that the matrices M and \u03a9\n~ one has (see Eqs. (67)\ntheir linearly independent components. Actually, for the matrix \u03a9\nand (69)):\n~ = \u2212AT \u03a9\n~ 1 B + BT \u03a9\n~ T A + AT \u03a9\n~ 2 A + BT \u03a9\n~ 3 B,\n\u03a9\n1\n\n(76)\n\nwhereas for the matrix M one obtains from Eq. (51) that\nM = AT M1 B + BT MT1 A + AT M2 A + BT M3 B \u2212 L,\n\n(77)\n\nwhere\nM1 = H \u22121Z,\n\nM3 = Z T H \u22121 Z.\n\nM2 = H \u22121 ,\n\n(78)\n\n~ i and Mi can be extracted from their linear combinations \u03a9\n~ and M (Eqs.\nBoth the sets \u03a9\n(76) and (77)) in the same manner as it had been done for the currents ~ji extracted from\nEq. (69). Thus, for the components Mi one has:\nM1 = \u03a0T1 M\u03a02 ,\n\n1\nM2 = \u03a0T1 M\u03a01 + \u03a3,\n2\n\n1\nM3 = \u03a0T2 M\u03a02 \u2212 \u039e\n2\n\n(79)\n\n1\n\u03a0T2 L\u03a02 = \u2212 \u039e\n2\n\n(80)\n\n(where the relations\n\u03a0T1 L\u03a02 = 0,\n\n1\n\u03a0T1 L\u03a01 = \u03a3,\n2\n\nfollowing from Eq.

These scalar and vector potentials with equal indeces have the\nMi and the vector \u03a9\nsame matrix dimensions and the same transformation properties. They can be combined\ninto three pairs of potentials with one scalar and one vector matrix potentials in any pair.\nAll these potentials are defined in terms of the \"main\" matrix potential Z; using Eq. (67)\nit is possible to relate vector and scalar matrix potentials.\nAt the end of this chapter let us come back to the linear theory described by the Lagrangian L0 . The heterotic string theory \u03c3\u2013model had been constructed as some \"minimal\"\n16\n\n\fnonlinear generalization of this linear theory, so one can wait that the properties of the\nnonlinear theory, being linearized in the appropriate way, take place for the linear one. WE\n~ i for the linear theory. To do it\nwould like to establish the sets of the potentials Mi and \u03a9\nlet us replace\nH = \u03a3\u03021 \u2192 \u03a31 = \u03a3.\n\n(82)\n\nThis immediately gives the following relations for the components Mi (see Eq. (78)):\nM1 = \u03a3Z,\n\nM2 = \u03a3,\n\nM3 = Z T \u03a3Z.\n\n(83)\n\nIt is easy to see that the charging symmetry transformations act on this set of Mi exactly as\non the nonlinear one. Then, if one also removes the nonlinear terms of the third and fourth\nsquare from Eq. (70), one obtains the set of matrix currents\n~j1 = \u03a3\u2207Z\n\u0011\n\u0010\n~j2 = \u03a3 Z \u039e\u2207Z T \u2212 \u2207Z\u039eZ T \u03a3,\n~j3 = \u2207Z T \u03a3Z \u2212 Z T \u03a3\u2207Z\n\n(84)\n\nwhich conserve on shell (i.e., have the zero divergences), when the motion equation (4) of\n~ i accordingly Eq. (74) and see,\nthe linear theory is satisfied. After that we define the set of \u03a9\nthat these vector potentials also transform as their analogies constructed for the heterotic\n~ for the linear\nstring theory. We can go even more far and to define the matrices ~j, M and \u03a9\n~ i must be taken\ntheory accordingly Eqs. (69), (76) and (77), where the sets ~ji , Mi and \u03a9\nin their linearized form. It is clear that, for example, Eq. (66) takes place again, but now\nLML =\n6 M\u22121 and \u2207M M\u22121L =\n6 ~j. Thus, it is impossible to rewrite the linear theory (3) in\nthe same chiral form as the heterotic string theory. However this fact is not really surprising,\nbecause in the opposite case one can make the false conclusion about the equivalence of these\nessentially different theories.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we have developed a new formalism for the heterotic string theory compactified\nto three dimensions on a torus. This formalism is based on the use of the single real matrix\npotential Z, which has the lowest possible matrix dimension possessing by the theory. Actually, Z is the (d + 1) \u00d7 (d + 1 + n) matrix, whereas the number of components of the scalar\nfields for the effective three\u2013dimensional heterotic string theory is exactly (d + 1) * (d + 1 + n)\n17\n\n\f(see Eq. (21)). The new formalism is naturally related to two sets of three scalar and three\n~ i (see some analogies for the case of General Relativity\nvector matrix potentials Mi and \u03a9\nin [12]). Both these sets, as well as the potential Z, undergo linear transformations under\nthe action of the charging symmetries.\nThe new formalism can be effectively applied for generation of the asymptotically flat\nsolutions of the heterotic string theory. The straightforward application of the relations (75)\nand (78) allows one to obtain the complete set of components for the vector and scalar fields of\nthe generated solution using only the algebraical (not differential) calculations. The result\nof this generation procedure will be nongeneralizable by means of the three\u2013dimensional\ncharging symmetries in the case when one uses for generation the matrices Ca restricted only\nby Eq. (29).\nThe developed formalism can be used for straightforward construction of the new solutions. In the forthcoming publications we hope to present some charging symmetry complete\nclasses of the asymptotically flat solutions constructed using the Z\u2013representation of the the~ i provide the compact and\nory. Here we would like to note that the potentials Mi and \u03a9\nconvenient tool for the study of monopole and dipole characteristics of any asymptotically\nflat field configuration. Moreover, in this analysis one can use the linearized variants of the\nmatrix potentials, because the higher nonlinear terms correspond to the higher multipole\nmoments.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by RFBR grant N 0 00 02 17135.\n\nReferences\n[1] E.
