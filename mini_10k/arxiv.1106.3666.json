A fine example of this is given by McVittie's inhomogeneous cosmological solution [3], the meaning\nof which has been debated since 1933. In retrospect, this effort has to be considered an utterly remarkable step into\nan area of research which is, to this day, still in its infancy [4]. The McVittie solution has been the subject of a large\nnumber of investigations (we point to the recent thesis by Martin [5] and the review given in [6]), and generalizations\n[7], but only recently did Kaloper, Kleban and Martin [8] (henceforth KKM) explain the misinformation which has\ndeveloped around this solution. In this paper we corroborate the main conclusion in KKM but also penetrate more\ndeeply into an understanding of a specific solution. By way of the specification of a characteristic function for the\nsolution, we exhibit a specific solution that asymptotes to the standard \u039bCDM universe. Remarkably, part of the\ninner boundary of this solution contains the inner bifurcation two - sphere of the non - degenerate Schwarzschild - de\nSitter spacetime. This tells us that both the black and white hole horizons of the extended Schwarzschild - de Sitter\nspacetime form part of the boundary of this McVittie solution, a possibility not envisioned in the KKM analysis. The\nspecification of a characteristic function provides sufficient detail to allow for an examination of energy conditions\nand a systematic construction of the conformal diagram based on detailed numerical integrations of the null geodesic\nequations. The present work suggests that the very notion of an inhomogeneity in cosmology may well go beyond\nthe concept of inhomogeneity in elementary physical variables. Finally, a minor point in the KKM analysis was the\nsuggestion that in the case of a zero cosmological constant, the would - be horizon forms a weak null singularity. Here\nwe find no evidence for this behaviour.1\nII.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\nA.\n\nOverview\n\nThe particular solution we are concerned with here is the simplest of the McVittie class,2 and this can be written\nin the form (e.g. [10]) [11]\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1 \u2212 m/2u\n2\nds = \u2212\ndt2 + e\u03b2(t) (1 + m/2u)4 (dr2 + r2 d\u03a922 )\n(1)\n1 + m/2u\nwhere u \u2261 re\u03b2/2 , m is a positive constant and d\u03a922 is the metric of a unit 2-sphere. Clearly, for m = 0 we obtain\na spatially flat Robertson - Walker metric, and for constant \u03b2, we have the Schwarzschild metric (here in isotropic\ncoordinates). These observations do not constitute an understanding of the metric (1). Indeed, it is a trivial exercise\nto construct distinct spacetimes with these two fundamental features. Perhaps, the enduring interest in the McVittie\nsolution derives from the observation that if we take the coordinates of (1) as comoving then we obtain a perfect fluid\nwith energy density \u03c1 and isotropic pressure p given by (e.g. [10])\n8\u03c0\u03c1 =\nwhere . \u2261 d/dt and\n\n3 2\n\u03b2\u0308\n3\n\u03b2\u0307 , 8\u03c0p = \u2212 \u03b2\u0307 2 \u2212 p\n4\n4\n1 \u2212 2m/R(t, r)\nR \u2261 u(1 + m/2u)2 .\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nThe uniform nature of the energy density and non-uniform nature of the pressure is often brought forward as a reason\nto consider this solution unphysical. However, even in the static Schwarzschild interior solution, such conclusions can\nbe considered hasty [12]. Our purpose here is not to argue, ab initio, for the physicality of the McVittie solution,\nbut rather our purpose is to exhibit in detail the rather remarkable, and heretofore unrecognized, geometric structure\nthat this solution presents. We comment on the idealization that the solution represents only once this structure is\ndeveloped.\n\n1\n2\n\nWhereas the analysis given here parallels, in some respects, that given in KKM, it also differs in a number of important aspects. We\npresent a full discussion and point out at various stages agreement and disagreement with the KKM analysis.\nRecently, study of the McVittie solution has been denigrated [9] with the view, in part, that this class of solutions is but a simple subset\nof a larger class of known solutions. The results presented in this paper argue for the contrary view. Even a simple looking metric can,\nwhen properly studied, yield a rich geometric structure.\n\n\f3\nUnder the coordinate transformation defined by (3), the metric (1) becomes (e.g. [10])\n\nwhere\n\ndR2\n2H(t)R\n+ R2 d\u03a922\ndtdR +\nds2 = \u2212f (t, R)dt2 \u2212 p\n1 \u2212 2m/R\n1 \u2212 2m/R\nf \u2261 1 \u2212 2m/R \u2212 H 2 R2\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nand H is the Hubble function, given by H = \u03b2\u0307/2 = \u0227/a where a(t) is the usual scale factor for m = 0. The form (4)\nis the basis for much of the analysis in KKM. Here we use the form (4) and additional transformations suitable for\nnumerical integrations. Let us note that the effective gravitational mass [13] associated with (4) is not m, but rather\nM , given by\n1\nM (t, R) = m + H 2 R3 .\n2\n\nB.\n\n(6)\n\nThe Function H\n\nHere we are not interested in arbitrary functions H, but only those that reflect, in a general way, the background\ncosmological model as it is currently understood. In particular, we take \u1e22 < 0 for finite t,\nlim H = H0 > 0, lim \u1e22 = lim \u1e26 = 0, lim H = \u221e,\n\n(7)\n\nlim \u03b2 = \u2212\u221e.\n\n(8)\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nt\u21920\n\nand\nt\u21920\n\nThese general properties are in fact crucial to the present analysis.\nAs recognized in KKM, t = 0 is not, in general, part of the spacetime. To see this here, from the definition of u\nand (8), we find limt\u21920 u = 0 for all finite r. From the definition (3) then we have\nlim R =\n\nt\u21920\n\n(\n\n0 if m = 0\n\u221e if m 6= 0\n\n(9)\n\nand so t = 0 is not, for m 6= 0, part of the spacetime (and no limit m \u2192 0 exists). This result depends on (8) and\nrelaxation of (8) gives rise to other more involved possibilities not discussed here.\n\nC.\n\nScalar Singularities\n\nLet us consider the singularities of (4), as revealed by scalars polynomial in the Riemann tensor. It turns out that\nwe need only report the Ricci scalar R, which we find is given by\n6\u1e22\nR = 12H 2 + p\n,\n1 \u2212 2m/R\n\n(10)\n\nin agreement with KKM, since all other invariants, derived from (partial) derivatives of the metric tensor no higher\nthan 2, add no new information. For 0 < t < \u221e, there is a singularity at R = 2m (u = m/2), which, as is clear\nfrom (1), is spacelike in agreement with KKM. The apparent singularity at t = 0, over the range 2m < R < \u221e is, as\nexplained above, not part of the spacetime (4) due to (8).\n\n\f4\nD.\n\nAsymptotics\n\nWith conditions (7) let us also consider the asymptotic limit t \u2192 \u221e, and in particular the roots to f0 = 1 \u2212 2m/R \u2212\nH02 R2 = 0. There are three cases: 27m2 H02 > 1, for which there are no positive roots, 27m2 H02 = 1, for which there\nis one (coincident) positive root R = 3m, and 27m2 H02 < 1 for which there are two distinct positive roots that satisfy\n0 < 2m < R\u2212 < 3m < R+ . It is only the last case which is of central interest here. As explained in detail below, we\nare interested in solutions that asymptote to de Sitter space for R and t \u2192 \u221e and become Schwarzschild - de Sitter\nspace for R \u2192 R\u2212 and t \u2192 \u221e. This requires (e.g. [14])\nH02 = \u039b/3\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u039b is the cosmological constant. For 27m2 H02 \u226a 1 we note that R\u2212 \u2243 2m and R+ \u2243 1/H0 , the Hubble length\n(e.g. [16]). The solution discussed here is essentially homogeneous at this length scale.\nE.\n\nThe Locus f = 0\n\nTangents to the locus f = 0, where f is defined by (5), are null for \u1e58 = 2H 2 R2 , that is, \u1e22 = 2H(3m \u2212 R)/R2 ,\nand timelike for \u1e58 < 2H 2 R2 . The tangents are spacelike for \u1e58 > 2H 2 R2 and for \u1e58 < 2H 2 R2 along the branch\ndR < 0, dt > 0. The essential features are summarized schematically in Figure 1.\n\nFIG. 1. The R \u2212 t plane and the locus f = 0. The locus is timelike above and to the right of n where \u1e22 = 2H(3m \u2212 R)/R2 .\nThe locus is spacelike below n. R = 3m is also shown. It passes through f = 0 at o where t = T such that 27m2 H(T )2 = 1.\nR = 3M is spacelike to the left the locus and timelike to the right. The trajectories R\u00b1 are spacelike. The asymptotic points\nare defined by a : (t \u2192 \u221e, R = 2m), b: (t \u2192 \u221e, R = R\u2212 ) and c: (t \u2192 \u221e, R = R+ ). These are explained below.\n\nIII.\n\nNULL GEODESICS - QUALITATIVE\nA.\n\nOutgoing and Ingoing Geodesics\n\nLet us first examine, qualitatively, general properties of the radial null geodesics (\u03b7 ) of (4). These must satisfy\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\np\ndR\n= 1 \u2212 2m/R HR \u00b1 1 \u2212 2m/R\n(12)\ndt \u03b7\n\nin agreement with KKM. Now, whereas for the \"+\" (\"outgoing\") branch clearly dR/dt > 0, the \"-\" (\"ingoing\") branch\nrequires further examination. From (5) and (12) it follows that for the \"-\" branch dR/dt > 0 for f < 0, dR/dt < 0\nfor f > 0, and dR/dt = 0 for f = 0. In particular, note that for f < 0, dR/dt > 0 along both branches of (12). It\nis appropriate here to note from (4) that tangents to surfaces of constant finite t are spacelike for R > 2m (and so\nfor finite t we set the future orientation dt/d\u03bb|\u03b7 > 0 for affine \u03bb increasing to the future) and tangents to surfaces of\nconstant R are spacelike for f < 0, null for f = 0 and timelike for f > 0.\n\n\f5\nB.\n\nExpansions\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nLetting k\u00b1\nsignify the 4-tangents to the radial null geodesics, the associated expansions \u03b8\u00b1 \u2261 \u2207\u03b1 k\u00b1\nfollow as\n!\nr\nr\n2m\n2m dt\n2\nHR \u00b1 1 \u2212\n,\n(13)\n1\u2212\n\u03b8\u00b1 =\nR\nR\nR\nd\u03bb \u00b1\n\nwhere evaluation along \u03b7 is now understood. This is in agreement with KKM up to the last term which is missing\nin the KKM analysis. The change in sign of \u03b8\u2212 at f = 0 led KKM to refer to f = 0 as an \"apparent horizon\".\nNormally, this description would be reserved for a change in sign of \u03b8+ since a change in sign of \u03b8\u2212 does not hide\nevents below f = 0 from distant observers. Now to see the importance of the last term in (13) consider t \u2192 \u221e along\ningoing geodesics. Clearly all but the last term \u2192 0. However, as we show below, t \u2192 \u221e at finite \u03bb and so the last\nterm in (13) diverges and as a result, \u03b8\u2212 becomes indeterminate in these coordinates. The removal of this ambiguity\nis discussed below.\nC.\n\nInfinity\n\nLet us examine the \"outer\" boundary of (4): (R \u2192 \u221e, t \u2192 \u221e) \u2261 I + (spacelike [15]). The radial null geodesic\nequations can be written in the form\n!2\np\nd2 R\ndH dt\n<0\n(14)\n= R(\u03bb) 1 \u2212 2m/R(\u03bb)\nd\u03bb2\ndt d\u03bb \u00b1\nwhere the inequality holds for finite t. From (14) it follows that R 9 \u221e for finite \u03bb and so both branches are future\nnull geodesically complete 3 . This is no surprise since I + is indistinguishable from I + for de Sitter space (given\n(11)). The \"inner\" boundary of (4) requires a much more detailed analysis. This is explained below. Here we simply\nintroduce the notation: (R = R\u2212 , t = \u221e) \u2261 H (null), and note that\nf |H = (R \u2212 2M )|H = 0,\n\n(15)\n\nand (R\u2212 < R < \u221e, t = \u221e) \u2261 i+ .\nIV.\n\nA SPECIFIC FORM FOR H\n\nIn order to examine the solutions to (12) we must first specify a specific background function H, which satisfies the\nconditions (7) and (8), since (12) appears to have no analytic solution for general H. Here we choose\nH=\n\nH0 sinh(3H0 t)\n3H0 t\n= H0 coth(\n)\ncosh(3H0 t) \u2212 1\n2\n\n(16)\n\nso as to reflect an asymptotic \u039bCDM universe.4\nV.\n\nENERGY CONDITIONS\n\nNote that we apply the classical energy conditions to (1) by way of the Einstein equations (without an explicit\ncosmological constant). As is clear from (2), with our general conditions on H, \u03c1 > 0 and \u03c1 + p > 0 and so the null\nand weak energy conditions are satisfied. For the dominant energy condition, \u2212\u03c1 < p < \u03c1 and so from (2)\n\u03b2\u0308\n3\n3\n3\n< \u03b2\u0307 2 .\n\u2212 \u03b2\u0307 2 < \u2212 \u03b2\u0307 2 \u2212 p\n4\n4\n4\n1 \u2212 2m/R\n3\n4\n\n(17)\n\nThe same conclusion has been obtained by Brien Nolan (private communication).\nThis choice does not limit all of what follows. For example, the completeness/incompleteness arguments given in Appendix A are\nunaffected by this choice.\n\n\f6\nWhereas the left hand inequality is always satisfied, given our general conditions on H, the right hand side can be\ngiven in the form\nR(t) > \u03c8(t)m\n\n(18)\n\nwhere, from (16),\n\u03c8=\n\n2(cosh(3H0 t) + 1)2\n.\ncosh(3H0 t)(cosh(3H0 t) + 2)\n\n(19)\n\nNow whereas the explicit value of \u03c8 at any t depends on H0 , the general form of \u03c8 does not. In particular, limt\u21920 \u03c8 =\n8/3 and limt\u2192\u221e \u03c8 = 2. The function \u03c8 is shown in Figure 2. We conclude that the dominant energy condition is\nsatisfied almost everywhere5.\n\nFIG. 2. The function \u03c8 given by (19). The curve has been constructed with H0 = 2.3 10\u221218 s\u22121 . T is defined by t = 10T where\n[t] = s. The current epoch is shown as a dot.\n\nFinally, the strong energy condition requires \u03c1 + 3p \u2265 0. From (2) it follows that this condition requires\n\u1e22 2\n2m\n\u2265 1 \u2212 4.\nR(t)\nH\n\n(20)\n\nFrom (16) we find\n1\u2212\n\n(cosh(3H0 t) + 4)(cosh(3H0 t) \u2212 2)\n\u1e22 2\n=\n4\nH\n(cosh(3H0 t) + 4)2\n\n(21)\n\nand so we arrive at\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 < 0 t < t0\n\u1e22\n1 \u2212 4 = = 0 t = t0\n\uf8f4\nH\n\uf8f3> 0 t > t\n0\n2\n\nwhere\n\n(22)\n\n\u221a\nln(2 + 3)\nt0 =\n(23)\n2H0\nand so the strong energy condition is satisfied everywhere for t \u2264 t0 . However, for t > t0 the strong energy condition\nis satisfied only for\nR(t) < \u03b4(t)m\n\n(24)\n\nwhere, clearly,\n\u03b4=\n\n2(cosh(3H0 t) + 4)2\n.\n(cosh(3H0 t) + 4)(cosh(3H0 t) \u2212 2)\n\n(25)\n\nSince, as it is easy to show, \u03b4 drops rapidly from \u221e at t0 to (limt\u2192\u221e \u03b4 =)2, we conclude that the strong energy\ncondition is eventually satisfied almost nowhere, as expected.\n5\n\nWe have no explanation for the curious position of the current epoch in Figure 2\n\n\f7\nVI.\n\nINTEGRATION OF THE NULL GEODESICS\nA.\n\nIntegration of (12) in the R \u2212 t plane\n\nWe now examine numerical solutions to the null geodesic equations (12), subject to the choice (16). First, consider\nthe outgoing geodesics given by \"+\" in (12). The integrations are shown in Figure 3. These geodesics are monotone\nin the R \u2212 t plane. In contrast, the ingoing geodesics (\"-\" in (12)) show considerably more structure. This is shown\nin Figure 4. We find 5 distinct types of evolution. Moving from the bottom right to the upper left in Figure 4\nwe find: (i) Geodesics which asymptote monotonically to H (again, defined by (R = R\u2212 , t = \u221e)) without crossing\nthe locus f = 0, (ii) A last geodesic that asymptotes monotonically to H without crossing f = 0 (call it \u03b7 2 ), (iii)\nGeodesics which reach a maximum R < R+ at f = 0 and then asymptote monotonically to H, (iv) A last geodesic\nthat asymptotes monotonically to R+ and terminates in i+ (call it \u03b7 1 ), and (v) Geodesics that cross R\u2212 and R+ and\nmonotonically evolve to I + . Now the cases (i) and the limit (ii), are absent in the KKM analysis, but are central to\nour examination of the inner boundary of (4). Since the form (12) is particularly sensitive to error for these cases, we\nnow introduce new coordinates to demonstrate, in more detail, that there do indeed exist ingoing null geodesics that\nreach H without crossing f = 0.\n\nFIG. 3. The outgoing solutions of the null geodesic equation (12) under the condition (16). The values taken are H0 = 1/3 and\nm = (1/(H0 l0 )) = 958041/2000000 \u223c 0.479 (where l0 is defined below). These values are of no consequence as we are simply\ninterested in the qualitative behaviour of the solutions to (12). The locus f = 0 is also shown. The values of the roots R\u00b1 are\nR+ \u223c 2.29 and R\u2212 \u223c 1.11. The cone shows the \"leg\" of the null cone under consideration.\n\nFIG. 4. The ingoing solutions of the null geodesic equation (12) under the same conditions as Figure 3.\n\n\f8\nB.\n\nIntegration of (12) in the z \u2212 l plane\n\nWe recast the problem as follows: Let\n\n6\n\nz\u2261\n\nr\n\n1\u2212\n\n2m\n,\nR\n\n(26)\n\nand let\nl\u2261\n\n1\n.\nHm\n\n(27)\n\nWe observe the ranges\n(R = 2m) 0 < z < 1 (R \u2192 \u221e)\n\n(28)\n\nand\n(t \u2192 0) 0 < l < l0 \u2261\n\n1\n(t \u2192 \u221e).\nH0 m\n\n(29)\n\nWith the definitions (26) and (27), equation (12) takes the form (using the asymptotic \u039bCDM model as before)\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndz\nl02\nz(1 \u2212 z 2 )2\n1 \u2212 z2\n.\n(30)\n=\n\u2212\ndl\nl\n2\n3(l02 \u2212 l2 )\nfor the ingoing case. At first sight this might not appear to simplify things, but it does. First note that we need only\nspecify l0 . For the case of central interest (27m2 H02 < 1) we have\n\u221a\nl0 > 3 3.\n(31)\nAs regards initial conditions, we have\ndz\ndl\n\n=\nz=0,l=l1\n\nl02\n3l1 (l02 \u2212 l12 )\n\n(32)\n\nwhich is regular over the range\n0 < l1 < l0 .\n\n(33)\n\nMoreover, we have\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4> 0\ndz \uf8f2\n=0\ndl \uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n<0\n\nf < 0, l <\nf = 0, l =\nf > 0, l >\n\n2\nz(1\u2212z 2 )\n2\nz(1\u2212z 2 )\n2\nz(1\u2212z 2 ) .\n\n(34)\n\nNumerical integrations are shown in Figure 5. Our conclusion is that null geodesics that reach H without crossing\nf = 0 are a fundamental feature of this solution.\nVII.\n\nGLOBAL STRUCTURE OF THE SPACETIME\nA.\n\nConstruction of the Conformal Diagram\n\nThe conformal representation of a spacetime (Penrose - Carter diagram [17]) is, of course, not unique in detail.\nHowever, all conformal representations must show the global structure of the spacetime.7 Here we construct the\n\n6\n7\n\nThis useful definition for z was pointed out to us by Brien Nolan (private communication).\nAll cases considered here are time-symmetric in the sense that the diagrams can be flipped upside down. Moreover, all diagrams can be\nrotated, interchanging the left and right hand sides.\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 5. Integration of (30) for l0 = 2000000/319347 \u223c 6.263 so that z\u2212 = 37/100 and z+ = \u221237/200 + 358931/2 /200 \u223c 0.76\nover the range 0 < l < l0 . The limiting geodesics \u03b7 1 and \u03b7 2 are shown as is the locus f = 0 (which connects H with i+ ). The\ndashed curves connecting z = 0 and H and i+ with z = 1 indicate d2 z/dl2 = 0.\n\nPenrose - Carter diagram in the following way: The construction of the diagram starts by solving the null geodesic\nequations numerically. This gives a general understanding of the global behavior of the spacetime. In the present\ncase, all of the outgoing geodesics and all of the ingoing geodesics originate from the singularity at R = 2m. These\ngeodesics intersect with R = 2m at some finite value of t > 0. That is, any point in the spacetime (t > 0, R > 2m)\ncan be connected to the past boundary (R = 2m, t > 0) by a unique null geodesic from each branch. We represent the\nboundary R = 2m as a horizontal line in a Cartesian plane (y = 0, \u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 1), setting the right end of R = 2m at\nt = 0, and the left end at t = \u221e. To represent the interval 0 < t < \u221e, from x = \u22121 to 1, we use the transformation\nfunction\n\u0010\n\u03c0\u0011\n(35)\nt = A(1 \u2212 x)B tan (1 \u2212 x) ,\n4\nwhere A and B are adjustable constants. A represents the value of t at the center of the line x = 0 and B adjusts\nthe position of b. These constants have no physical significance and where adjusted only for visual presentation (we\nchose A \u223c 0.39 and B \u223c 0.75). Once this line is adopted [18], any point in the spacetime can be projected onto the\nconformal diagram by solving for both null geodesics that pass through any point, and numerically solving for the\nvalue of t at which these two curves reach R = 2m; say t1 , and t2 . This is illustrated in Figure 6. Once these two\nvalues of t are found, we can represent them in the conformal diagram by solving for x in (35). This gives us x1 and\nx2 . Finally, we find the conformal representation of the original point by finding the intersection of the same two null\ngeodesics, but presented in the conformal diagram as y = \u2212x + x1 for one geodesic, and y = x \u2212 x2 for the other.\nThis is illustrated in Figure 7. By our choice (35), all diagrams are strongly compactified in the region R > R+ .\n\nB.\n\nNull geodesics\n\nUnder the procedure described above, Figure 3 is mapped into the right hand side of Figure 8 and Figure 4 is\nmapped into the left hand side of Figure 8.\n\nC.\n\nSurfaces of constant R and t\n\nUsing the same procedure, at the left in Figure 9 we show surfaces of constant t and at the right in Figure 9 we\nshow surfaces of constant R. The surfaces of constant t are spacelike for all finite t. The surfaces of constant R are\nspacelike for f < 0 and timelike for f > 0.\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 6. Locating t1 and t2 for any event via null geodesics. The locus f = 0 is shown. Note that t increases to the right.\n\nFIG. 7. Conformal representation of the event (t, R). The locus f = 0 is shown. Note that t increases to the left.\n\nD.\n\nThe fluid streamlines\n\nThe streamlines r = constant can be written out explicitly in z \u2212 l coordinates in the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\u0012 2 \u0013 \u0012 2\n1\nl0 \u2212 l12\nl\nz(l) = tanh\nlog\n6\nl12\nl02 \u2212 l2\nwhere z(l1 ) = 0. Transforming to the R \u2212 t plane, these streamlines take the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nH(t1 )2 \u2212 H02\nR(t) = 2m cosh\nlog\n6\nH(t)2 \u2212 H02\n\n(36)\n\n(37)\n\nwhere R(t1 ) = 2m. These streamlines are shown in Figure 10. Note that the streamlines do not cross H. This fact\ncan be considered the source of relation (15) and is the central part of the original construction [3].\nE.\n\nThe boundary and ingoing geodesics\n\nIn Figure 11 we summarize the boundary of (4) and classify ingoing null geodesics which do not terminate on I + .\nWe are now in a position do discuss the affine completeness/incompleteness of these geodesics. As is discussed in detail\nin Appendix A, all these geodesics are incomplete except \u03b7 1 which we find to be complete. This incompleteness is the\ncentral point in KKM, but their analysis revealed only the section (b, i+ ) of H. Here we observe that \u03b7 2 terminates\nat b on H and we observe very special properties associated with b as explained in Appendix B: b is characterized by\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 8. At right, the conformal representation of the outgoing null geodesics as given in Figure 3. The locus f = 0 is shown.\nThe bottom horizontal line represents the singularity R = 2m. At left the conformal representation of the ingoing null geodesics\nas given in Figure 4.\n\nvanishing expansion for both the ingoing and outgoing radial null geodesics. This is the hallmark of a bifurcation two\n- sphere. This bifurcation two - sphere divides H into two sections: a \"black hole\" horizon to the future of b and a\n\"white hole\" horizon to the past of b. This is explored in the completion to the spacetime given below.\n\nF.\n\nA completion\n\nOne possible extension of the McVittie spacetime, which is null geodesically complete, is shown in Figure 12 where\nwe have identified the inner bifurcation two - sphere of the Schwarzschild - de Sitter spacetime with that of the\nMcVittie spacetime [22]. This enlarged spacetime now has a center of symmetry, the center of the Schwarzschild de Sitter black hole at R = 0. Ingoing null geodesics below \u03b7 1 but above \u03b7 2 terminate at the singularity R = 0 in\nthe Schwarzschild - de Sitter black hole. Whereas \u03b7 2 joins onto the \"left\" black hole horizon of the Schwarzschild de Sitter spacetime, all \"ingoing\" geodesics below \u03b7 2 have R monotonically increasing, pass through the white hole\nhorizon and terminate at R = \u221e, that is, I + of the Schwarzschild - de Sitter spacetime. Whereas the degenerate\ncase 27m2 H02 = 1 is outside the cases of interest from a physical point of view, it offers a very instructive limit from\na mathematical point of view since \u03b7 1 and \u03b7 2 then coincide and b disappears. This is examined in Appendix C.\n\nVIII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have performed a detailed study of a particular McVittie solution, by way of the specification of a characteristic\nfunction, that asymptotes to the standard \u039bCDM cosmology and that contains an inner boundary that is a slice of\nthe extended Schwarzschild - de Sitter spacetime. We have found that this inner boundary contains a bifurcation\ntwo - sphere where the expansion of both the ingoing and outgoing radial null geodesics vanishes. To the future of\nthis bifurcation on this inner boundary we have found a black hole horizon at finite affine distance and therefore we\ncorroborate the main conclusion in the work of Kaloper, Kleban and Martin. In addition, however, we have found a\nwhite hole horizon to the past of the bifurcation which is also at finite affine distance. In the degenerate limit of this\nparticular solution the bifurcation two - sphere and black hole horizon disappear leaving only the white hole horizon,\nalso at finite affine distance. We have shown that the null and weak energy conditions are satisfied and that the\ndominant energy condition is satisfied almost everywhere. The global structure of the solution has been constructed\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 9. At left the conformal representation of surfaces of constant t. The locus f = 0 is also shown. Moving from the bottom\nright to the upper left we have: t0 < t < T (where 27m2 H(T )2 = 1), t = T , t = t1 > T and t2 > t1 . The boundary has t \u2192 \u221e.\nAt right the conformal representation of surfaces of constant R. The locus f = 0 is also shown. Moving from the bottom left\nto the upper right we have: 2m < R0 < R < R\u2212 , R = R\u2212 , R\u2212 < R < 3m, R = 3m, R = R+ , R1 > R+ . The right boundary\nhas R \u2192 \u221e and the left boundary has R = R\u2212 .\n\nFIG. 10. The fluid streamlines r = constant > 0 in the conformal diagram. The streamlines are timelike and r increases to the\nright. Note that the streamlines do not cross H which is the limit r \u2192 0.\n\nsystematically based on detailed numerical integrations of the null geodesic equations. In the case H0 = 0, the work\nof Kaloper, Kleban and Martin suggested that the would - be horizon forms a weak null singularity. In Appendix D\nwe argue that this is not the case. Moreover, we argue that this case is rather less interesting than H0 > 0 since the\nsolutions can have a black hole horizon to the future of the singularity at R = 2m or a white hole horizon to the past\nof R = 2m.\nThe present analysis relies on the (standard) condition (8). Relaxing this, it is clear that we can maintain the\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 11. The conformal representation of the boundary to the spacetime (4) given (16). The boundary is defined as follows: The\nsingularity R = 2m, I + \u2261 (R = \u221e, t = \u221e), i+ \u2261 (R\u2212 < R < \u221e, t = \u221e), H \u2261 (R = R\u2212 , t = \u221e), \u2212 i0 \u2261 (2m \u2264 R < R\u2212 , t \u2192 \u221e)\nand + i0 \u2261 (2m \u2264 R < \u221e, t > 0).\n\nFIG. 12. An extension of the McVittie spacetime which is null geodesically complete. The inner bifurcate two - sphere of the\nSchwarzschild - de Sitter spacetime (b) is identified with that of the McVittie spacetime.\n\nconditions (7) but also violate (9). This means that in general the initial singularity will consist of two parts: the\n\"pressure\" singularity at R = 2m, and a generalized \"big bang\" singularity at t = 0. In a sense this shows how\n\"delicate\" the solution is. The fact that the McVittie solution cannot represent a physically realistic inhomogeneity\nis, we think, best shown by a glance at Figure 10 and equation (15). By construction, no fluid streamlines can cross H\nand so the black and white hole horizons are present here by way of mathematical extensions, not physical processes.\nThere is no easy fix for this situation, within the context of McVittie's approach, since a routine calculation shows\nthat (1) is a perfect fluid if and only if dm/dt = 0. Nonetheless, the present analysis shows that a rather routine\n\n\f14\nlooking spacetime, like (1), can in fact harbor a rather exotic interior. Moreover, the present analysis suggests that the\nvery notion of an inhomogeneity in cosmology may go beyond the concept of inhomogeneity in elementary physical\nvariables.\nWhat we have done here can be expanded in a number of ways. First, of course, one could relax condition (16)\nand consider a wider class of possibilities. In all cases one would find that if the vacuum boundary (H) contains a\nbifurcate two - sphere, then this bifurcate two - sphere is also part of the McVittie solution itself. This geometric\nbehaviour can be traced to McVittie's no - flux condition which preserves the integrity of H. One can reasonably\nexpect that the integrity of H is destroyed by any flux through it. To conclude, we believe that the McVittie solution\nis an instructive idealization very much like the Kruskal - Szekeres extension.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported in part by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada\n(to KL) and a Carmichael Fellowship (to MA).

Define some fiducial R0\nso that\nh(R0 ) = \u2212\u03b1\n\n(A4)\n\nwhere 0 < \u03b1 < 1/12m.

First, for clarity, let us review the situation in the Schwarzschild vacuum. As shown\nin [20], the Kruskal - Szekeres metric can be given as\nds2 = (2M )2 ds\u03032\n\n(B1)\n\nwith\nds\u03032 =\n\n\u22124\ndudv + (1 + L)2 d\u03a922\n(1 + L)e1+L\n\n(B2)\n\n\f17\nwhere\nL \u2261 L(\u2212\n\nuv\n)\ne\n\n(B3)\n\nand L is the Lambert W function [21]. Trajectories with tangents k \u03b1 = eL (1 + L)\u03b4v\u03b1 (constant u = u0 , \u03b8 and \u03c6) are\nradial null geodesics given by\nv(\u03bb) = \u03bbe\u2212\n\nu0 \u03bb\ne\n\n(B4)\n\nwhere \u03bb is an affine parameter and we note the expansion\n\u2207\u03b1 k \u03b1 =\n\n\u22122u0\n.\ne(1 + L)\n\n(B5)\n\nTrajectories with tangents l\u03b1 = eL (1 + L)\u03b4u\u03b1 (constant v = v0 , \u03b8 and \u03c6) are radial null geodesics given by\nu(\u03bb) = \u03bbe\u2212\n\nv0 \u03bb\ne\n\n(B6)\n\nand we now note the expansion\n\u2207\u03b1 l\u03b1 =\n\n\u22122v0\n.\ne(1 + L)\n\n(B7)\n\nOn the horizons u = 0 and v = 0 then v and u are affine parameters. The bifurcation two - sphere is given by\nu = v = 0 and it is uniquely characterized by \u2207\u03b1 k \u03b1 = \u2207\u03b1 l\u03b1 = 0.\nThe McVittie solution under consideration in this paper reduces [22] to the Schwarzschild - de Sitter spacetime on\nH and so we need a more general construction. We follow [23]. It is shown there that for all static metrics\nds2 = \u2212f dt2 +\n\ndr2\n+ r2 d\u03a922 ,\nf\n\n(B8)\n\nwhere f is a polynomial with simple root(s),\nf (r) = (r \u2212 a)h(r)\n\n(B9)\n\nwhere h(a) 6= 0, one can construct regular extensions about r = a via the transformations\nZ\nk(r)\nuv = \u00b1(r \u2212 a) exp( 2\u03ba\ndr + E),\nh(r)\n\n(B10)\n\nwhere the sign depends on how we choose to orientate the u \u2212 v axis, E is a constant and\nv\n= exp(2\u03bat)\nu\n\n(B11)\n\nwhere \u03ba is the surface gravity given by\n\u03ba\u2261\n\u2032\n\n1 df\n2 dr\n\na\n\n6= 0.\n\n(B12)\n\n\u2032\n\nNote that according to (B10) r = r(uv) and r |a 6= 0, \u2261 d/duv. Under these transformations the Killing vector\n\u03b7 \u03b1 = \u03b4t\u03b1 becomes \u03b7 \u03b1 = (u, \u2212v, 0, 0) and one recovers the usual definition of the bifurcation two - sphere at u = v = 0.\nNote that the specified construction can always be done. However, about a distinct root, say r = b 6= a, a new chart\nmust be constructed about r = b.\nTo calculate null geodesic expansions note that the metric takes the form\nds2 = K(r)dudv + r2 d\u03a922\n\n(B13)\n\nwhere\nah(r)\nK(r) \u2261 \u00b1 2 exp(\u22122\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\nZ\n\nk(r)\ndr).\nh(r)\n\n(B14)\n\n\f18\nThe integration constant has been absorbed into the factor a and again the choice of sign determines the orientation\n\u03b4v\u03b1\n(constant u = u0 , \u03b8 and \u03c6) are radial null geodesics with\nof the u \u2212 v axis. Trajectories with tangents k \u03b1 = K(r)\nexpansions\n\u2207\u03b1 k \u03b1 =\nand trajectories with tangents l\u03b1 =\n\n\u03b1\n\u03b4u\nK(r)\n\nu0 \u2032\nr,\nK(r)r\n\n(B15)\n\n(constant v = v0 , \u03b8 and \u03c6) are radial null geodesics with expansions\n\u2207\u03b1 l\u03b1 =\n\n\u2032\nv0\nr.\nK(r)r\n\n(B16)\n\nThe bifurcation two - sphere associated with any non - degenerate horizon at r = a is therefore characterized by the\nsimultaneous vanishing of both the ingoing and outgoing radial null geodesic expansions; \u2207\u03b1 k \u03b1 = \u2207\u03b1 l\u03b1 = 0.\nAppendix C: The degenerate case 27m2 H02 = 1\n\nSince \u1e22 < 0, f0 \u2265 f .

As a result, all\ningoing and outgoing radial null geodesics have dR/dt > 0 and there can be no bifurcation two - sphere. All ingoing\ngeodesics that reach H do so without crossing f = 0 first and as in the non - degenerate case we find that these\ningoing geodesics are incomplete. The ingoing radial null geodesics in the z \u2212 l plane are shown in Figure 13.\n\n\u221a\nFIG. 13. As in Figure 5 but for l0 = 1/H0 m = 3 3 (again we take H0 = 1/3). The limiting geodesics \u03b7 1 and \u03b7 2 now coincide\nand give \u03b7 . There is no locus f = 0. The dashed curves connecting z = 0 and H and H with z = 1 indicate d2 z/dl2 = 0.\n\nA possible extension of the associated McVittie solution is shown in Figure 14 where we have used the mapping\nfunction\n\u0010\n\u03c0\u0011\n(C2)\nt = A(1 \u2212 x)tan (1 \u2212 x)\n4\nwith A \u223c 1.9 and a degenerate Schwarzschild - de Sitter \"interior\".\n\n\f19\n\nFIG. 14. As in Figure 12 but now for the degenerate case.\nAppendix D: H0 = 0\n\nThe case H0 = 0 proceeds in a fundamentally different way than the case H0 > 0. To see this, consider the usual\nbackground of \"dust\" so that H = 2/3t. Defining x = R/m and T = t/m the locus f = 0 takes the form\n2x3/2\nT = \u221a\n(D1)\n3 x\u22122\n\u221a\n\u221a\nand so surfaces\u221aof constant t never intersect the locus for t < 2 3m, intersect it once for t = 2 3m and intersect it\ntwice for t > 2 3m. Moreover, every surface of constant R, for 2m < R < \u221e, crosses the locus once and at finite\nt. This last point shows us that eventually all ingoing radial null geodesics have f > 0 and so eventually dR/dt < 0.\nThere is no bifurcation two - sphere in this McVittie spacetime. To integrate the radial null geodesics we continue to\nuse (26) but replace (27) with\nl=\n\n1\n.\n1 + mH\n\nThe radial ingoing null geodesic equations now take the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(1 \u2212 z 2 )2 2(1 \u2212 l)\ndz\n=\n\u2212\nz\n.\ndl\n6(1 \u2212 l2 ) l(1 \u2212 z 2 )\n\n(D2)\n\n(D3)\n\nThe integrations are shown in Figure 15. Using the same procedures as before, the surfaces of constant R and constant\nt are shown in Figure 16. We find that H is at finite affine distance along ingoing null geodesics but I + is at infinite\naffine distance along outgoing null geodesics (this spacetime is asymptotically flat).\nThe conformal diagram and a possible extension onto the Kruskal - Szekeres manifold is shown in Figure 17. There\nis now a black hole horizon to the future of the singularity and a white hole horizon in the past. These now form a\nwedge, not a straight line.\nNow KKM argue, their considerations motivated by quantum gravity arguments, that the invariant\n\u2206 \u2261 \u2207\u03b9 \u2207\u01eb R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 \u2207\u03b9 \u2207\u01eb R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\n\n(D4)\n\ndiverges on the horizon. It is difficult to see how this would come about since at the horizon, using conditions (7), with\nH0 \u2265 0, the metric tensor along with all first and second order (partial derivatives) are continuous. Using GRTensor\nII [24], and assuming H is \u2208 C 3 , we find\nlim \u2206 =\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n1440m2 2 3\n(H0 R (11H02 R3 \u2212 24R + 50m) + 14R2 \u2212 60Rm + 65m2 )\nR12\n\n(D5)\n\n\f20\n\nFIG. 15.
