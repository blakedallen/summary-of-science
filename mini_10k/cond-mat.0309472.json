In analogy with turbulent\nRayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection, we develop the relevant theoretical framework in which we discuss\nthe local-power-law-scaling of Nu with a dimensionless electrical forcing parameter R. For these\nexperiments where 104 . R . 2 \u00d7 105 we find that Nu \u223c F(\u0393)R\u03b3 with \u03b3 either = 0.26 (\u00b10.02)\nor 0.20 (\u00b10.03), in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of \u03b3 = 1/4 and 1/5. Our\nmeasurements of the aspect ratio-dependence of Nu for 0.3 \u2264 \u0393 \u2264 17 compares favorably with the\nfunction F(\u0393) from the scaling theory.\n\nHeat transport has for many years been the cornerstone in the study of turbulent Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection (RBC) [1]. Over the past three years there has been\nremarkable experimental [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and theoretical [9, 10, 11] progress in characterizing the properties\nand mechanisms of heat transfer in fluids heated from\nbelow. So far, experiments and theory are relevant only\nto approximately unit aspect ratio systems i.e. geometries that have comparable lateral and vertical dimensions. Turbulent convection flows in nature, however, are\nlaterally extended and the transport of heat across a layer\nof fluid has been inadequately studied as a function of the\naspect ratio \u0393 = lateral dimension/vertical dimension.\nIn particular, experiments at \u0393 > 2 have seldom been\nperformed primarily because it is extremely difficult to\nachieve the strong forcing that is readily reached in \u0393 \u2248 1\ncontainers.\nIn this Letter, we present a study of an analogous electrically driven convecting system which allows a broad\nrange of \u0393 to be explored at moderate levels of forcing.\nWe show that measurements of the normalized charge\ntransport Nu varies with the aspect ratio \u0393 consistent\nwith a function F given by the scaling theory. The strong\ndependence on \u0393 especially for \u0393 \u2248 1 implies that experiment and theories relevant to this regime are restrictive.\nThe data and the function F become increasingly independent of \u0393 for \u0393 \u226b 1. This observation highlights the\nimportance of developing experiments and theory for laterally extended systems where it appears that universal\nbehavior, often lacking in \u0393 \u2248 1 systems, may be restored [12]. Our data also reveal that Nu \u223c R\u03b3 with\n\u03b3 = 0.26 and 0.20 in agreement with a local-power-lawscaling theory developed in a manner identical to the\nGrossmann-Lohse (GL) model for turbulent RBC [9, 10].\nIn previous work, it has been demonstrated that an\nelectrically conducting, freely suspended liquid crystal\nfilm between parallel wires could be driven to convect\nwhen a sufficiently large potential drop was applied\nacross its edges [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

Analogous to RBC\nwhere an inverted mass density distribution is unstable\nto buoyant forcing, the thin film has an inverted surface\ncharge density distribution that is unstable to electrical\nforcing. In this system, an initial bifurcation to convection rolls occurs when the applied voltage V exceeds a\ncritical voltage Vc , corresponding to the critical temperature difference in RBC. Secondary bifurcations occur\nat higher forcing and result in changing the number of\ncounter-rotating vortex pairs that are arranged around\nthe annulus. At much higher forcing the fluid becomes\nturbulent but retains the large scale structure of the rolls\nor convection cells.\nElectroconvecting smectic films have several advantages and disadvantages relative to traditional RBC experiments. In turbulent RBC experiments, the accurate\nmeasurement of heat transport requires detailed accounting of the heat conducted through the sidewalls [3]. The\nannular geometry of the smectic film (see Fig. 1a) is\nfree of lateral boundaries and consequently without sidewall losses, which facilitates precise measurement of the\ncharge transport between the inner and outer electrodes.\nThe film is an annular disk of width d = ro \u2212 ri \u223c 5\nmm and thickness s \u223c 0.1 \u03bcm. Here ri (ro ) are the\nradii of the inner (outer) electrodes that support the film\n(see Fig. 1b). These radii can be varied so as to achieve\ndifferent values of \u0393. The tiny size of the film, which contains many orders of magnitude less working fluid than\nrequired for an RBC experiment, results in data acqui-\n\n\f2\n\n\u03b4I\n\n-11\n\n10\n-10\n\n10\n\nI (amperes)\n\nsition timescales of minutes, rather than days. On the\nother hand, the smectic film is delicate and while many\nfilms survive vigorous forcing without thickness change,\nsome do suffer sudden thickness variations. Since Vc and\nother properties of the flows depend on thickness, these\ndata must be discarded. The dc electrical forcing also\nresults in conductivity drifts in the films, which result in\nsystematic uncertainties. The experiments we describe\nhere were carried out at atmospheric pressure, which increases the film stability. But air drag, which is known to\nproduce a quantitative but not qualitative change to the\ndissipation, is not properly accounted for in the theory.\nNevertheless, notwithstanding these caveats, we are able\nto efficiently explore the turbulent scaling regime over a\nbroad range of \u0393, complementing RBC experiments.\nOur experiment consists of a temperature controlled\nfilm of octylcyanobiphenyl (8CB), a smectic-A liquid\ncrystal, suspended between two concentric gold-plated\nelectrodes. In the smectic-A phase, the film flows as\nan isotropic, incompressible and Newtonian fluid in the\nplane of the film. The flow is strictly two-dimensional.\nThe film is driven to electroconvect by a dc voltage applied to its inner edge while holding the outer edge at\nground potential. The annular assembly is enclosed in\na Faraday cage. An experiment consists of imposing a\nvoltage V to the inner electrode and measuring the current I transported through the film with a sensitive electrometer. The applied voltage was varied between 0 and\n1000 volts in a sequence of small incremental and decremental steps resulting in a current-voltage characteristic. Further details of the apparatus and procedure can\nbe found in Refs. [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Figure 2 shows\na representative current-voltage (IV) characteristic. For\nV < Vc the fluid is quiescent with the current sustained\nby ohmic conduction. When V > Vc the fluid is organized in counter-rotating vortices and additional charge\nis transferred by convection; this is seen by the increase\nin slope of the IV-characteristic. At higher voltages, the\nfluid becomes turbulent and the transition is marked by\na sudden increase in the rms fluctuations of the current,\nas shown in the inset of Fig. 2.\nA film is a 2D annular sheet. The film has thickness/width s/d \u223c 10\u22124 . Geometrically, a film is described by its radius ratio \u03b1 = ri /ro and the aspect ratio \u0393r = \u03c0(ri + ro )/(ro \u2212 ri ), which is the ratio of the\nmid-radius circumference to the film width. So defined,\n\u03c0 < \u0393r < \u221e. To make correspondence with the conventional aspect ratio \u0393 for RBC, we define \u0393 = \u0393r \u2212 \u03c0\nfor the annulus. Two other dimensionless parameters\ndescribe the experimental system: R = \u01eb20 V 2 /\u03c3\u03b7s2 and\nP = \u01eb0 \u03b7/\u03c1\u03c3sd. Here R is the control parameter and is\na measure of the external electrical forcing and P, the\nPrandtl-like parameter, is the ratio of the time scales of\nelectrical and viscous dissipation processes in the film.\nIn the above the fluid density, molecular viscosity, and\nconductivity are denoted by \u03c1, \u03b7, and \u03c3, and \u01eb0 is the\n\n-12\n\n10\n\n-13\n\n10\n\nV\n\n-14\n\n10\n-11\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10\n\n-12\n\n10\n\n-13\n\n10 1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nV (volts)\nFIG. 2: A representative current-voltage curve for an annular film showing the onset of electroconvection.

The transition to turbulent flow is marked by a sudden large increase in the fluctuations.

We define the normalized charge transport or\nNusselt number Nu = I/Icond . Figure 3 shows representative sets of Nu vs R data at \u0393 = 0.33 \u00b1 0.01 and\n6.60 \u00b1 0.02. We find that Nu \u223c R\u03b3 for 104 \u2264 R \u2264 2 \u00d7 105\nwith either \u03b3 = 0.26 \u00b1 0.02 or \u03b3 = 0.20 \u00b1 0.03, depending on the size of P. The error bar is obtained from the\nvariation in the best-fit value of \u03b3 over 26 data sets for\nall four values of \u0393.\nWe developed a theoretical model describing turbulent\nelectroconvection by borrowing from turbulent RBC. The\nequations of motion that describe electroconvection consist of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation supplemented with an electrical body force, the charge conservation equation that accounts for ohmic conduction and\nadvection of charge and Maxwell's equation that relates\nthe surface charge density to the electric potential;\np\nq\n\u2202t u + u * \u2207u = \u2212\u2207 + \u03bd\u22072 u \u2212 \u2207\u03c8,\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u2202t q + u * \u2207q = \u03c3\u22072 \u03c8,\nq = \u22122\u01eb0 \u2202z \u03c8 .\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\nThese equations are constrained by the no-slip and applied electric potential boundary conditions. In the above\nequations \u2207, u, p and \u03bd are the 2D gradient, velocity,\npressure and kinematic viscosity respectively. The electric potential \u03c8 is three dimensional and extends outside\nthe film, where (\u22072 + \u2202z2 )\u03c8 = 0. The Maxwell equation\nrelates the perpendicular gradient of \u03c8 to the surface\n\n\f3\n\n\u03bd 3 RP \u22122 (Nu \u2212 1)\n,\nln(1/\u03b1)(ro2 \u2212 ri2 )(ro \u2212 ri )2\n2\u03c3V 2 Nu\n=\n.\nln(1/\u03b1)(ro2 \u2212 ri2 )\n\n\u01ebu =\n\n(4)\n\n\u01eb\u03c8\n\n(5)\n\nThese relations are similar to those for the kinetic and\nthermal dissipation in RBC presented in Refs. [9, 10, 22].\nFollowing the GL theory, we decompose the kinetic and\nelectric dissipations into bulk and boundary layer parts:\n\u01ebu,\u03c8 = \u01ebBULK\n+ \u01ebBL\nu,\u03c8\nu,\u03c8 . Considering the various combinations of the dominant contributors to the total dissipation (e.g. BL-\u03c8 and BULK-u etc.) we can determine\nthe corresponding local power-law scalings for each of\nthe regimes. We assume that the turbulent flow is comprised of convection cells that tile the annulus as shown\nin Fig. 1a and that each cell is roughly square i.e. it has\nthe same transverse and lateral dimension. The large\nscale circulation is then the vortex that defines a cell.\nAssuming laminar boundary layer scaling we can then\nshow that\nNu \u223c F(\u0393)R\u03b3 P \u03b4 , Re \u223c R\u03b3\u2217 P \u03b4\u2217 , and\n!\n\u0393+\u03c0\n\u0393 + 2\u03c0\nF(\u0393) =\n.\nln\n\u03c0\n\u0393\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nAs might be expected, we find the same set of exponents \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b3\u2217 , \u03b4\u2217 that appear in the GL theory. Here, Re\nis the Reynolds number of the large scale circulation.\nIn the relatively small R regime, the total dissipation is\ndominated by the BL-contributions and the theory predicts \u03b3 = 1/4 and \u03b4 = 1/8. In a neighboring regime\nwhere the dissipation is primarily \u01ebBULK\nand \u01ebBL\nu\n\u03c8 , the\ntheory predicts \u03b3 = \u03b4 = 1/5. Our measured \u03b3 exponents,\nas shown in Figure 3 are in reasonable agreement with the\ntheoretical predictions from the GL model, if we suppose\nthat we traverse the appropriate regimes as P varies. A\ndetailed validation of the theory would depend crucially\n\n6\n5\n4\n\nNu\n\ncharge q. The factor of 2 arises from the film's two free\nsurfaces. The relation between \u03c8 and q is thus nonlocal\nand somewhat complex. It can be considerably simplified by making a local approximation, setting q = 2\u03b2\u03c8,\nwhere \u03b2 is a certain constant. This local approximation\nhas been shown to be adequate in describing the onset of\nelectroconvection. See Ref. [18] for a detailed discussion\nof the theoretical model.\nThe Eqns. 1, 2 are similar to the Boussinesq equations\nfor turbulent RBC. In particular, in the local approximation, there is an almost precise correspondence between\nthe temperature and the electric potential. The periodicity of the annular geometry and thereby of the velocity\nand electric potential allow for exact relations for the\nglobally-averaged kinetic and electric dissipations. Denoting averages over the system volume by h* * *i we find\nthe following for the kinetic dissipation \u01ebu \u2261 h\u03bd(\u2207u)2 i\nand for the electric dissipation \u01eb\u03c8 \u2261 h\u03c3(\u2207\u03c8)2 i:\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\nR\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFIG. 3: Plots of Nu vs R for \u0393 = 0.33 \u00b1 0.01(\u25b3) and 6.60 \u00b1\n0.02(\u25e6). For these P = 8.8 \u00b1 0.3 and 36 \u00b1 1 respectively. The\nsolid reference lines have slopes of 1/5 and 1/4 respectively.\n\non either directly demonstrating the correctness of the\nassumptions about the dominant contributions to the dissipation or on systematically showing that the right local\npower-law scalings are indeed obtained as one varies P\nand R. Our experiments currently span only relatively\nlow R < 2 \u00d7 105 and sparsely cover the rather wide range\n5 < P < 250. Many more experiments will be needed to\nadequately test the GL theory for turbulent electroconvection.\nIn the theoretical treatment described above, we have\ntaken into account the dependence on the aspect ratio\nof the system, a consideration that was missing in the\nGL theory which treated only \u0393 \u2248 1 systems [9, 10, 11].\nWe find that the charge transport is modified by a \u0393dependent factor F(\u0393). Since the large scale circulation\nis local to each convection vortex, Re is independent of\n\u0393. Unlike Ref. [22], we find the aspect-ratio dependence\nis not a power-law scaling but rather a function of the finite annular geometry. We can make a direct comparison\nwith previous turbulent RBC experiments by making a\ncorrespondence between the different cell geometries, using \u0393 = \u0393r \u2212 \u03c0 as described above. We plot kF(\u0393) vs.\n\u0393, with the constant k = \u03c0/((\u03c0 + 1) ln(2\u03c0 + 1)) = 0.382.\nFollowing Ref. [2], we choose this normalization so that\nkF(\u0393 = 1) = 1. Then kF \u2192 0.764 in the \u0393 \u2192 \u221e limit.\nThe function kF decreases monotonically with \u0393 with\nthe greatest variation for \u0393 < 2, and is within 2% of the\nlimiting value for \u0393 > 7.\nOur experimental data span the range 0.3 \u2264 \u0393 \u2264 17.\nFrom power-law fits to Nu vs. R data we have extracted\nthe exponents \u03b3. To determine F(\u0393) we then divide\nNu by R\u03b3 P \u03b4 . Because our data extend over a rather\nwide range of P, we expect to cross regimes with differing \u03b3 and \u03b4[9, 10]. To extract the aspect ratio dependence alone, we used the fitted value of \u03b3, and where\n\u03b3 \u2248 0.25 (0.20), we used the GL-theory prediction of\n\u03b4 = 1/8 (1/5).

The solid circles (\u2022) are from the present work. Data\nfrom RBC experiments in Acetone, with (3) and without (2)\nsidewall correction are from Refs. [3] and [2]. Also shown are\ndata in Air (\u25b3), from Ref. [24], Helium (\u25bd) from Ref. [25]\nand (\u22b3) from Refs. [4, 8] and water (\u22b2) from Refs. [23]. The\ninset shows the same data on a logarithmic scale.\n\nwe again scaled these results so that F(\u0393 = 1) = 1. Our\ndata for 4 different \u0393 are in reasonable quantitative agreement with the theoretical function F, as shown in Fig. 4.\nEach data point is an average over 4 \u2212 10 runs. The error\nestimates are representative of the scatter in F over these\ndata. In particular, the largest contribution to the error\nat \u0393 = 16 is systematic and arises from the ambiguity in\nthe correct exponent for P.\nData from several turbulent RBC experiments[2, 3, 4,\n8, 23] for 4 values of \u0393 are also broadly in agreement\nwith the function F, in spite of the difference in geometry\nand the higher range of Rayleigh numbers. Earlier RBC\nexperiments[24, 25] used gases as the working fluid and\ndeviate significantly from F.\nSeveral important questions are raised by our results\non the aspect ratio dependence of charge transport in turbulent electroconvection and, by extension, that of heat\ntransport in turbulent RBC. The strong dependence of\nF on \u0393 for 0 \u2264 \u0393 . 7, suggests that the dynamics of\nturbulent convection is dependent on the system's lateral extent. That the charge or heat transport, a global\nproperty, is sensitive to the aspect ratio further suggests\nthat local properties such as temperature and charge fluctuations may be even more strongly dependent on \u0393. Experiments in turbulent RBC clearly show that while heat\ntransport is insensitive to cell geometry at fixed \u0393 \u2248 1,\nthe fluctuations are strongly affected by the shape of the\nlateral boundary [12]. The relative independence of F on\n\u0393 for large aspect ratio, \u0393 & 7 suggests that the normalized charge and heat transport approach a universal\nvalue in laterally extended systems. We conjecture that\nfluctuations in the interior may also become universal in\nlarge aspect ratio systems.\n\nOur results emphasize the importance of extending\nconvective turbulence experiments to larger aspect ratios. For turbulent smectic electroconvection, we would\nlike to make a systematic study of the scaling of Nu in\nthe parameter space of R and P. P can be varied in\nprinciple by changing the thickness and/or width of the\nfilm. We would also like to study long time series of Nu in\norder to infer the characteristic size and duration of the\nfluctuations. It is a challenge to extend the forcing parameter R to values much beyond 106 , since this requires\napplying large voltages across the film that may result in\ndielectric breakdown. A first step would be to better\ncontrol the electrochemistry of the liquid crystal film to\nreduce drifts and push down the critical voltage Vc . It\nwould also be interesting to extend our previous studies\nof electroconvection under shear [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] to\nthe turbulent regime. Finally, we would like to develop\nlocal probes to study the fluctuations of the velocity and\nelectric potential over the film.\nWe thank G. Ahlers, E. Ben-Naim, R. E.
