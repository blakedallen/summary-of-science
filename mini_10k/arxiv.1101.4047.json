Introduction\n\nA self-avoiding polygon (SAP) on a regular lattice L is the piecewise linear embedding\nof a simple closed curve as a sequence of distinct edges joining vertices in L. The\nnumber of distinct unrooted polygons modulo translations is denoted pn . It is known\n1/n\nthat limn\u2192\u221e pn = \u03bc exists, where \u03bc is the self-avoiding walk growth constant [7, 8].\n\nFigure 1. Minimal trefoils on the SC (left - 24 edges), FCC (middle - 15\nedges) and BCC (right - 18 edges).\n\nThe knot type of polygons in three-dimensional lattices are well defined. Denote\nby pn (K) the number of unrooted polygons of length n and knot type K, modulo\ntranslations. Computing pn or pn (K) is a very difficult combinatorial problem, though\ndetermining the minimal length n such that pn (K) > 0 and the numbers of shortest\nembeddings is viable for knot types of low complexity. For example, there are 3\nshortest unknots of length 4 in the simple cubic lattice (SC), 8 of length 3 in the\nface-centred cubic lattice (FCC), and 12 of length 4 in the body-centered cubic lattice\n(BCC). The simplest non-trivial knot type is the trefoil (denoted by 31 , see Figure 1)\nand it is known that pn (31 ) = 0 if n < 24 and p24 (31 ) = 3328 in the SC [9]. Data on\npolygons collected by the GAS algorithm [10] shows that p15 (31 ) = 128 in the FCC\nand p18 (31 ) = 3168 in the BCC (see Table 1); no shorter trefoils were observed.\nNumerical studies [3, 4, 6, 5, 10] have shown that pn (K) behaves as\npn (K) \u2243 CK \u03bcn\u2205 n\u03b1\u22123+NK ,\n\nas n \u2192 \u221e,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere NK is the number of prime components of the knot type K. The exponent\nis thought to be universal, while the growth rate, \u03bc\u2205 , depends on the lattice but not\nthe knot type. The amplitude, CK , depends on both the lattice and the knot type.\nUnfortunately very little of this form can be proven rigorously - the exponential\ngrowth rate is only known to exist when K is the unknot. A pattern-theorem [1, 2]\nshows that the growth rate of unknots, \u03bc\u2205 , is strictly smaller than \u03bc. The same\nargument also shows that the probability that a polygon of length n has knot type K,\ngiven by pn (K)/pn , decays exponentially with length.\nIn this paper we consider the asymptotic behaviour of ratios of knotting\nprobabilities. In particular, for two prime knot types K and L one has NK = NL = 1\nand the ratio of probabilities is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\npn (K)\nCK\npn (K)/pn\n, as n \u2192 \u221e.\n(2)\n=\n\u2243\npn (L)/pn\npn (L)\nCL\nHence, the limiting ratio of probabilities approaches a constant. Since this limit is an\namplitude ratio we expect it to be universal - depending only on the knot types and\nthe universality class of the underlying model.\n\n\fOn the universality of knot probability ratios\n\n3\n\nSuch ratios were studied previously on the SC [10] (by the methods used in this\npaper) and in [11] (by very different methods). Here, we use the GAS algorithm to\nestimate pn (K) for various prime knots on the SC, FCC and BCC lattices. Our results\nindicate that the above ratio is dependent on the knot types, but independent of the\nunderlying lattices, and so, universal.\n2. Atmospheric moves on cubic lattices\nThe GAS algorithm [12] samples along sequences of conformations that evolve through\nlocal elementary transitions called atmospheric moves (see eg. [13]). The algorithm is a\ngeneralisation of the Rosenbluth algorithm [14, 15], and is an approximate enumeration\nalgorithm.\nThe GAS algorithm was used to estimate the number of knotted polygons on the\nSC [10] using BFACF moves [16, 17, 18] as atmospheric moves. This implementation\nrelies on a result in [19] that the irreducibility classes of the BFACF elementary moves\napplied to SC polygons are the classes of polygons of fixed knot types [19].\n\nFigure 2. Elementary moves of the BFACF algorithm on the SC lattice.\n\nBFACF elementary moves (see Figure 2) are either neutral (or Type I) operating\non two adjacent orthogonal edges of a SC polygon, or the are of Type 2 which are\npositive or negative length changing moves. A neutral moves exchanges two adjacent\nedges over a unit lattice square which defines a neutral atmospheric plaquette. A\nnegative move replaces three edges in a \u2293 conformation by a single edge and so defines\na negative atmospheric plaquette. Similarly a positive move replaces a single edge of the\npolygon by three edges in a \u2293 arrangement; these edges define a positive atmospheric\nplaquette. Let a+ (\u03c6), a0 (\u03c6), a\u2212 (\u03c6) be the total numbers positive, neutral and negative\natmospheric moves of a SC lattice polygon \u03c6.\n\nFigure 3. (Left) There are 4 elementary triangular plaquettes incident to each\nedge in the FCC lattice. (Middle and right) Each edge in the BCC lattice\nis incident to 12 plaquettes; 6 planar and 6 non-planar (the remaining 3 are\nreflections of the 3 displayed).\n\nThe plaquettes in the FCC and BCC lattice (see Figure 3) define elementary\nmoves in the FCC and BCC analogous to the BFACF moves. Since the FCC plaquettes\nare triangles they define positive and negative moves, while the BCC plaquettes are\n\n\f4\n\nOn the universality of knot probability ratios\n\nquadrilaterals and so also give neutral moves. These generalisations are discussed at\nlength in [20] and it is shown that on each lattice the irreducibility classes of the moves\ncoincide with classes of polygons of fixed knot types.\n3. GAS sampling of knotted polygons\nWe have implemented the GAS algorithm using the atmospheric moves described\nabove. Let \u03c60 be a lattice polygon, then the GAS algorithm samples along a sequence\nof polygons (\u03c60 , \u03c61 , . . .), where \u03c6j+1 is obtained from \u03c6j by an atmospheric move.\nEach atmospheric move is chosen uniformly from the possible moves, so that if\n\u03c6j has length lj then\nPr(+) \u221d \u03b2lj a+ (\u03c6j ),\n\nPr(0) \u221d a0 (\u03c6j ),\n\nPr(\u2212) \u221d a\u2212 (\u03c6j ).\n\n(3)\n\nha+ il\nwhere \u03b2l is a parameter that is chosen to be approximately ha\n. This parameter\n\u2212 il\ncan be chosen so that on average the probability of making a positive move is roughly\nthe same as that of making a negative move. This produces a sequence h\u03c6j i of states\nand we assign a weight to each state:\nn\nY\na\u2212 (\u03c60 ) + a0 (\u03c60 ) + \u03b2l0 a+ (\u03c60 )\n(l \u2212l\n)\n(4)\n\u03b2 j j+1 .\n\u00d7\nW (\u03c6n ) =\na\u2212 (\u03c6n ) + a0 (\u03c6n ) + \u03b2ln a+ (\u03c6n ) j=0 lj\n\nThe probabilities and weights are functions of the number of possible atmospheric\nmoves and so the algorithm must recalculate these efficiently. Since the elementary\nmoves only involve local changes, executing a move and updating the polygon takes\nO(1) time.\nThe resulting data were analysed by computing the mean weight hW in of polygon\nof length n edges and then using the result (from [12])\nhW in\npn (K)\n=\n.\nhW im\npm (K)\n\n(5)\n\nThis gives approximations to the number of polygons of any given length n, provided\nthe number of polygons is known exactly at another length m.\n4. Results\nWe collected data on the prime knots 31 , 41 , 51 and 52 on the three lattices. In order\nto use equation (5) we computed the total number minimal length polygons of fixed\ngiven knot type - see Table 1. We did this by collecting them while performing the\nsimulation (or in independent runs); this idea was used in [9] and [10] and our SC\nresults agree. Typically, the algorithm quickly found all realisations of minimal knots\n(within hours) and then failed to find new conformations after another few days of\nCPU time. We note that the result for trefoils in the SC has been proved [21, 9].\nUsing the data in Table 1 and equation (5) we were able to estimate pn (K) for\neach knot type in each of the three lattices. Each simulation ran for 1 week on a single\nnode of WestGrid's Glacier cluster\u2021. The implementation was particularly simple and\nefficient in the FCC lattice and the SC simulations were faster than the BCC lattice\nsimulations. Each simulation was composed of approximately 400 chains of length 227\npolygons on the FCC lattice, 1400 chains of 223 polygons on the simple cubic lattice\n\u2021 See http://www.westgrid.ca\n\n\f5\n\nOn the universality of knot probability ratios\nKnot\nlength\n4\n24\n30\n34\n36\n\n01\n31\n41\n51\n52\n\nSC\nnumber\n3\n3328\n3648\n6672\n114912\n\nFCC\nlength number\n3\n8\n15\n64\n20\n2796\n22\n96\n23\n768\n\nBCC\nlength number\n4\n12\n18\n1584\n20\n12\n26\n14832\n26\n4872\n\nTable 1.

In each simulation we limited the\nmaximum length of the polygons to 512 edges.\nThe estimates of pn (K) in each lattice were used to extrapolate the ratios\npn (K)/pn (L) for fixed prime knots K, L. In earlier work on SC polygons [10] we\nobserved that the logarithm of these ratios were approximately linear in n\u22121 . In\nFigures 4, 5 and 6 we plot the logarithm of the ratio against n\u22121 for various pairs of\nprime knots.\nIn Figure 4 we show that there is strong agreement between the FCC and BCC\ndata. In addition, the three extrapolated curves appear to have approximately the\nsame limit. This is strong numerical support for the hypothesis that the limiting ratio\nis universal.\nLinear fits of the data gives y-intercepts of 3.34(3), 3.35(3), 3.29(3) for the SC, the\nFCC and the BCC lattices (respectively). These results includes each other within 95%\nconfidence intervals. Exponentiating these results estimates the limiting amplitude\nratio to be 27 \u00b1 2. If we exclude the BCC data, since it is not as well converged at\nlarge n, we obtain a limiting ratio of 28 \u00b1 1.\n6\n\n5\n\nlog\n\n\u0010\n\npn (31 )\npn (41 )\n\n\u0011\n\nSC\nFCC\nBCC\n\n4\n\n3\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\n1/n\nFigure 4.

In the final plot we show the ratio of 51 to\n52 knots.

Curiously, in each case\nwe found that the curves for the FCC and BCC lie close together while that of the\nSC stands apart; we would like to understand this better, but have no explanation at\nthis time.\nSome caution is needed when comparing these results to previous studies of knot\nprobability amplitudes such as [22, 23, 11]. Any estimate of the amplitude will have\nsensitive dependence on the estimate of the exponent. Indeed, unless the estimated\nexponents are equal, the ratio of the estimated probabilities will tend to zero or infinity.\nMindful of this, we may compare the ratio of estimated amplitudes for SC\npolygons from [11] we find C31 /C41 \u2248 22 which is close to our estimate, but not within\nmutual error bars. The ratio of estimated amplitudes for off-lattice polygons from [22]\nand [23] give quite different results. However, it is not clear that our models are in the\nsame universality class as these off-lattice models. In addition, the comparison may\nalso be affected by differences in estimated entropic exponents in these studies.\n5. Conclusions\nWe have studied the ratio of probabilities of different knot types. The scaling\nassumption in equation (1) indicates that the limit of this ratio should be an amplitude\nratio and thus universal. Using the GAS algorithm we have formed direct estimates\nof the number of polygons of various prime knot types on three different lattices.\nExtrapolating from these estimates provides numerical evidence that the probability\nratios are universal - depending only on the knot types and the universality class\nof the underlying model. In particular we find that a long polygon is about 28 times\nmore likely to be a trefoil than a figure-eight.\nThere are a number of extensions of this work that we would like to pursue -\nextending these results to composite knots and links, and also to perform similar\nanalyses of data from off-lattice models.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank BIRS and the organisers of the conference where we had the\nidea for this paper after discussions with several participants; in particular, Bertrand\nDuplantier.
