The quantitative success of gauge\ncoupling unification [3] in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) extensions of these theories [4, 5] has provided further support for this idea [6].\nThese successes motivate one to look for similar high-scale explanations of the rich\nflavor structure we observe at low energies. While the three Yukawa matrices appear\nas independent parameters in the Standard Model, they can become correlated in an\nextension: e.g., in specific GUTs there are relations between fermion masses, such as\nthe SU(5) relation mb = m\u03c4 [7]. As with the unification of gauge couplings this relation\napplies only at the unification scale and is modified by renormalization group (RG)\nrunning down to the weak scale. Indeed, these corrections offer a further tantalising piece\nof circumstantial evidence in favour of supersymmetric unification for, starting with the\nrelation mb (MX ) = m\u03c4 (MX ), they bring the prediction for mb /m\u03c4 into agreement with\nexperiment using the same value for the unification scale MX as found in the analysis\nof gauge couplings. This illustrates both how the analysis of fermion masses can lend\nsupport to the hypothesis of (supersymmetric) unification, and how we can learn about\nthe puzzling flavor structure of the SM from unified theories.\nHowever, additional predictions for fermion masses and mixing angles require more\nsophisticated unified theories. One reason for this is that the simple relations ms = m\u03bc\nand md = me are in gross disagreement with experiment even with RG corrections included. Such problems inspired Georgi and Jarlskog [8] to study a different unified ansatz,\nwhich was then developed and extended to other ans\u00e4tze in many subsequent studies\nwith some success (see for example [9, 10]). Despite this, one problem that looms over\nGUTs, and especially their extensions addressing such flavor structure, is the difficulty\nof building a Higgs structure that achieves the desired pattern of vacuum expectation\nvalues (VEVs) and breaking. Most notorious is the doublet-triplet splitting problem of\nSU(5) and other GUTs. Although solutions, such as the Dimopoulos-Wilczek mechanism in SO(10) are possible [11], the full Higgs structure necessary to realise the flavor\nrelations tends to be unattractive. In addition the constraints from the non-observation\nof proton decay are now so severe as to disfavor or even rule out many of the simplest\nmodels [12].\nRecently, a new possibility for the embedding of the SM into a form of GUT has\nbeen suggested in Refs. [13\u201319]. The idea is that the GUT gauge symmetry is realized in\n5 or more space-time dimensions and only broken down to the SM by compactification\non a singular 'orbifold', utilizing GUT-symmetry violating boundary conditions. Given\nthe success of the traditional supersymmetric gauge-coupling unification predictions, the\nmost attractive model is one with both supersymmetry and (in a sense we make precise)\nSU(5) gauge symmetry. Then in the 5d case both the GUT group and 5d supersymmetry are broken by compactification on S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) down to a N=1 SUSY model with\nSM gauge group. This construction allows one to avoid some unsatisfactory features of\nconventional GUT's with Higgs breaking, such as doublet-triplet splitting, while main1\n\n\ftaining, at least at leading order, the desired gauge coupling unification [15, 16, 21]1. The\nsignificant advantage of the effective field theory approach to orbifolds that we advocate,\nis that large classes of (consistent low-energy) models can be surveyed, and phenomenologically interesting features or mechanisms identified.\nIn this paper we examine what we consider a very appealing explanation of the\nhierarchical structure of the quark and lepton masses and mixing angles based on a generalization of the S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) orbifold GUT model. Our hypothesis is that flavor hierarchies are a result of the geometrical suppression of some couplings due to wavefunction\nnormalization factors arising when fields propagate in different numbers of dimensions.\nLocality and the detailed nature of the orbifold projections in field space play significant\nroles as fixed branes of various dimensionalities and in various locations are an automatic\nfeature of the S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) orbifold mechanism for SU(5) breaking. We find that quite\nsimple models of this sort lead to notably successful flavor textures.\nThe outline of our paper is as follows. In Section 2 we briefly recall the essential\nfeatures of the S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) orbifold mechanism, paying particular attention to aspects\nthat are important in the construction of our theory of flavor. In Section 3 we explain\nthe basic idea of our approach to the flavor problem, while Section 4 is devoted to the\nexamination of these ideas in the simplified context of models for the flavor structure\nof the heaviest 2 generations. We find that a simple hypothesis is strikingly successful\nin explaining many features of 2nd and 3rd generation masses and mixing angles: the\nonly matter propagating in the 5th dimension is the second generation 10 of SU(5). Full\nthree generation models of flavor require that we generalize this S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) model to\nsix dimensions. The construction and appealing aspects of such models are discussed in\nSection 5. Finally, Section 6 contains our conclusions.\n\nBasics of the S 1 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 model\n\n2\n\nIn this Section we provide an introduction to the physics of the simplest orbifold GUT\nmodel, the SU(5) model on the 5 dimensional space M4 \u00d7 (S 1 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ). We closely follow\nthe discussion and notation of Refs. [15, 16].\nIn addition to 4d Minkowski space consider a 5th dimension with orbifold structure\nS /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ). (We label the usual 4d coordinates x\u03bc , \u03bc = 0, . . . , 3, while the 5th coordinate x5 \u2261 y.) The circle S 1 is assumed to have radius R where 1/R \u223c MGUT . The\norbifold S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) is obtained by modding out the theory by two Z2 transformations\nwhich impose on bulk fields the equivalence relations: P : y \u223c \u2212y and P \u2032 : y \u2032 \u223c \u2212y \u2032\n(here y \u2032 \u2261 y + \u03c0R/2). Under these actions there are two inequivalent fixed 3-branes (or\n'orbifold planes'), which we denote O and O \u2032, located at y = 0, and y = \u03c0R/2 \u2261 l,\nrespectively. The physical domain of the theory is the interval y \u2208 [0, l] with the O, O \u2032\nbranes acting as 'end-of-the-world' branes.\n1\n\nThe action of the equivalences P, P \u2032 must also be defined within the space of fields:\nP : \u03a6(x, y) \u223c P\u03a6 \u03a6(x, \u2212y) and P \u2032 : \u03a6(x, y \u2032 ) \u223c P\u03a6\u2032 \u03a6(x, \u2212y \u2032 ), where here, P\u03a6 and P\u03a6\u2032\n1\n\nThese features are shared with those of the original string orbifold constructions [20].\n\n2\n\n\fare matrix representations of the two Z2 actions, and we can classify the fields by their\n(P, P \u2032) eigenvalues (\u00b11, \u00b11). Then the KK expansions of bulk fields \u03a6P P \u2032 (x, y) involve\ncos(ky/R) with k = 2n or 2n + 1, for \u03a6+P \u2032 (P \u2032 = +, \u2212 respectively), and sin(ky/R) with\nk = 2n + 1 or 2n + 2, for \u03a6\u2212P \u2032 (P \u2032 = +, \u2212 respectively). Only the \u03a6++ possess a massless\nzero mode, the other KK modes acquire a mass k/R from the 4d perspective. Only \u03a6++\nand \u03a6+\u2212 have non-zero values at y = 0, while only \u03a6++ and \u03a6\u2212+ are non-vanishing at\ny = l. The action of the identifications P, P \u2032 on the fields (the matrices P\u03a6 and P\u03a6\u2032 )\ncan involve any symmetry of the bulk theory; gauge transformations, discrete parity\ntransformations, and R-symmetry transformations in the supersymmetric case; and this\nallows one to break the bulk symmetries.\nThe starting point for phenomenology is a 5d SU(5) gauge theory with minimal 5d\nSUSY (8 real supercharges, corresponding to N = 2 SUSY in 4d). Thus, at minimum,\nthe bulk must have the 5d vector superfield, which in terms of 4d N = 1 SUSY language\ncontains a vector supermultiplet V with physical components A\u03bc , \u03bb, and a chiral multiplet\n\u03a3 with components \u03c8, \u03c3. Both V and \u03a3 transform in the adjoint representation of SU(5).\nIf the parity assignments, expressed in the fundamental representation of SU(5), are\nchosen to be P = diag(+1, +1, +1, +1, +1), and P \u2032 = diag(\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, +1, +1), so that\nthe equivalence under P is\nV a (x, y)T a \u223c V a (x, \u2212y)P T aP \u22121 ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a3a (x, y)T a \u223c \u2212\u03a3a (x, \u2212y)P T a P \u22121 ,\n\n(2)\n\nand similarly for P \u2032, then SU(5) is broken to SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1) on the O \u2032 fixed-brane,\nbut is unbroken in the bulk and on O. If for \u03a3 the same assignments are taken apart\nfrom an overall sign for both P and P \u2032 equivalences, e.g., under P ,\nthen these boundary conditions also break 4d N = 2 SUSY to 4d N = 1 SUSY on both\nthe O and O \u2032 branes. Only the (+, +) fields V a possess massless zero modes (a labels the\nunbroken SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1) generators of SU(5), while \u00e2 labels the broken generators),\nand at low energies only the gauge content of the 4d N = 1 MSSM is apparent.\nOn the other hand, the bulk of the theory is invariant under both the full SU(5)\ngauge symmetry and the full 5d minimal supersymmetry. If we take the MSSM matter\nto reside in the bulk, then they must come in complete SU(5) multiplets. In fact the\ncorrect situation with regard to quantum numbers is slightly more subtle. The reason\nfor this is that the bulk N = 2 SUSY appears to pose a problem. The minimal matter\nsuperfield representation for such a theory is a hypermultiplet, which in 4d N=1 language\ndecomposes in to a chiral multiplet \u03a6R together with a mirror chiral multiplet in the\nc\nconjugate representation \u03a6R\n. Thus, the choice of matter in the bulk would appear to\nhave problems reproducing the chiral structure of the SM.\nFortunately as shown in detail in Ref. [16] (see also [15]) the structure of the orbifold\nprojections P and P \u2032 acting on fields resolves this in a particularly interesting fashion.\nThe action of these projections on the N=1 component fields \u03a6 and \u03a6c residing in a 5d\nhypermultiplet is inherited from the action on the 5d vector multiplet Eqs. (1)-(2). The\nresult is that actions of both P and P \u2032 on the 4d chiral fields \u03a6 and \u03a6c have a relative\nsign:\nP : \u03a6 \u223c P\u03a6 \u03a6,\nP : \u03a6c \u223c \u2212P\u03a6 \u03a6c ,\n(3)\n3\n\n\fand similarly for P \u2032 . This difference leads to a chiral spectrum for the zero modes. Indeed the KK spectrum of 5d bulk hypermultiplets in the representations 10 and 5 (whose\nc\n4d chiral components we denote T + T c + F + F ) resulting from the P, P \u2032 actions is\ngiven in Table 1. Note that since P \u2032 does not commute with SU(5), components in\ndifferent SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1) representations have different KK mode structures. Thus\nQ, U , D, L, E, etc., are used to indicate their SM transformation properties. It is important in the following that the zero modes under this action do not fill out full SU(5)\nmultiplets of SM matter. From T we just get U and E zero modes, while from F we get\nL.\n(P, P \u2032) 4d superfield\n(+, +)\nTU , TE , F L\n(+, \u2212)\nTQ , F D\nc\n(\u2212, +)\nTQc , F D\nc\n(\u2212, \u2212)\nTUc , TEc , F L\n\n4d mass\n2n/R\n(2n + 1)/R\n(2n + 1)/R\n(2n + 2)/R\n\nTable 1.

The\nsubscript labels the SM transformation properties, e.g., Q = (3, 2)1/6 , Q = (3, 2)\u22121/6 ,\nU = (3, 1)\u22122/3 , etc.\nThe remaining components of a full SU(5) multiplet are realised at the zero mode\nlevel by taking another copy of 10 and/or 5 in the bulk (with N = 1 chiral components\nc\ndenoted T \u2032 + T \u2032c and F \u2032 + F \u2032 respectively), and using the freedom to flip the overall\naction of the P \u2032 parity on these multiplets by a sign relative to the action on T + F .\nThis difference leads to a different selection of zero mode components, the KK spectrum\nbeing given in Table 2.\n(P, P \u2032) 4d superfield\n(+, +)\nTQ\u2032 , F \u2032 D\n(+, \u2212) TU\u2032 , TE\u2032 , F \u2032 L\nc\n(\u2212, +) TU\u2032c , TE\u2032c , F \u2032 L\nc\n(\u2212, \u2212)\nTQ\u2032c , F \u2032 D\n\n4d mass\n2n/R\n(2n + 1)/R\n(2n + 1)/R\n(2n + 2)/R\n\nTable 2. Parity assignments and KK masses of fields in 4d chiral supermultiplets resulting\nfrom the decomposition of 5d hypermultiplets in the (T \u2032 + F \u2032 ) representation.\nCombining the results of Tables 1 and 2 we have zero modes which fill out the full\nmatter content of either (or both) a 10 or 5 multiplet of SU(5) at the zero mode level, but\nwithout the doubling due to N = 2 bulk SUSY. Moreover, since different components\nof what we think of as a single 10 or 5 in fact arise from different parent multiplets in\nthe higher dimension, the usual SU(5) counting of independent couplings, and thus the\nrelations between masses and mixing angles is modified. We will soon utilize this feature\nin the construction of realistic models of flavor.\n4\n\n\f3\n\nFlavor Hierarchies from Geometry\n\nFirst, to set notation, recall that in the Standard Model, the quark and lepton masses\nand the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix are parameterized in terms\nof three 3 \u00d7 3 matrices, (U, D, E) of Yukawa coupling constants. In the MSSM, and after\nelectroweak symmetry breaking the Yukawa interactions lead to:\nv\nv\nv\ni\ni\ni\nLmass = QL Uij ujR \u221a sin \u03b2 + QL Dij djR \u221a cos \u03b2 + LL Eij ejR \u221a cos \u03b2 + h.c.,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere i, j = 1, 2, 3 are generation indices, tan \u03b2 = hHu i / hHd i, is the ratio of Higgs\nvacuum expectation values, and v = 246 GeV. The full Yukawa matrices, U and D are\nnot determined by experiments, rather they fix only the diagonal mass matrices, U diag ,\nand D diag , and the CKM mixing matrix, VCKM . The relations between these objects are\nspecified by the diagonalizing unitary rotations Lu , Ru , Ld , and Rd acting in generation\nspace on the up and down sectors:\nU diag = Lu URu\u2020 ,\n\nD diag = Ld DRd\u2020 ,\n\nVCKM = Lu L\u2020d .\n\n(5)\n\nOur basic strategy to go beyond the usual SU(5) treatment of the flavor structure\nof the SM matter is to use the geometrical suppression of some couplings due to the\nwavefunction normalization factors that arise when some fields propagate in different\nnumbers of dimensions (this is similar to the arguments used in the context of neutrinos\nand other SM neutral states in the case of large extra dimensions [25]).\nAn illustrative example of the physics is provided by the following slightly simplified\nmodel: Consider the 5th dimensional line segment y \u2208 [0, \u03c0R/2] of the orbifold models\nwith SU(5)-invariant O-brane at y = 0, and SU(5) breaking O \u2032 brane at y = l \u2261 \u03c0R/2.\nThere are then three possible locations for each multiplet: in the SU(5)-preserving 5d\nbulk, or at the O or O \u2032 branes. If the light SM states arise from the zero modes \u03a60 of\na bulk\n\u221a field (generically denoted \u03a6) then the normalization factor of these zero modes2\nis 1/ M\u2217 l, where M\u2217 is the UV cutoff scale of our effective higher-dimensional theory.\nAlternatively some SM states can come from brane localized fields \u2013 generically \u03c8 \u2013 which\nwe initially take to be located at y = 0 for simplicity. Then the Yukawa interactions in\nthe 4d effective Lagrangian are of the form (x dependence suppressed):\nL \u2243\n\nZ\n\n\u001a\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\ndy \u03bb0 \u03b4(y)\u03c8 + \u03bb1 \u03b4(y)\u03c8 \u03a6(y) + \u03bb2 \u03b4(y)\u03c8\u03a6 (y) + \u03bb3 \u03b4(y)\u03a6 (y) +\n\n\u2243 \u03bb0 \u03c8 3 +\n\n\u03bb\u20323 \u03a63 (y)\n\n\u03bb1\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb3\n\u03bb\u20321\n2\n2\n3\n\u03c8\n\u03a6\n+\n\u03c8\u03a6\n+\n\u03a6\n+\n\u03a63 .\n(0)\n(M\u2217 l)1/2\n(M\u2217 l) (0) (M\u2217 l)3/2 (0) (M\u2217 l)1/2 (0)\n\n\u001b\n\n(6)\n\nThis equation, which is crucial for the rest of our analysis, requires some explanation.\nFor any interaction which contains at least one brane localised field (\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 , or \u03bb2 ) there is\nautomatically a localising \u03b4(y)-function \u221a\nwhen the Lagrangian is written in 5d. Then, for\nthese terms, the number of factors of 1/ l in the effective 4d Lagrangian is simply given\n2\n\nThe factor of M\u2217 arises from correctly normalizing the kinetic terms so that the zero modes are\nfields with 4d canonical dimensions.\n\n5\n\n\fby the number of bulk fields in the interaction, as each one has this wavefunction factor.\nHowever for an interaction that involves only bulk fields \u03a6 there are two possibilities.\nThe first (\u03bb\u20323 ) is that the Yukawa interaction occurs everywhere in the bulk. In this case\nthere is no \u03b4-function, and for a cubic term two of the wavefunction\nfactors get cancelled\n\u221a\nby the integral over y \u2208 [0, l], leading to just one power of 1/ M\u2217 l overall. The second\npossibility is that although the fields \u03a6 live in the bulk, the interaction occurs only on\nthe brane.\nThis corresponds to the \u03b4-function in the \u03bb3 coupling, leading to three factors\n\u221a\nof 1/ M\u2217 l in the 4d effective coupling. (In the case with more than one brane such an\ninteraction can occur at either, or both of the branes. This can be important in some\ncircumstances.)\nThe second situation may seem unlikely, however it is in fact the typical case. The\nreason for this is that, as we mentioned above, the minimal supersymmetry in 5d corresponds to N = 2 from the 4d perspective. But N = 2 supersymmetry does not allow\nYukawa interactions between matter hypermultiplets, so the interactions between the\ncomponent N = 1 chiral multiplets are confined to the branes where the N = 2 SUSY\nis broken to N = 1 by the orbifold conditions.\nThe various possible flavor models are characterized by the placement of the Ti and\nF i multiplets that make up the three generations of quarks and leptons. In addition it is\nalso possible for the Higgs multiplets to be located in either the bulk or on the O \u2032-brane\n- if they were on the O-brane the doublet-triplet splitting problem re-emerges. To have\nat least some SU(5) mass relations, such as b \u2212 \u03c4 unification, the Higgs must reside in\nthe SU(5)-symmetric bulk, in which case they form components of 5 and 5 in the bulk\nwhich we denote H and H respectively; for definiteness we will focus on this case in the\nfollowing. In the next two sections we explore forms for the Yukawa matrices following\nfrom the preceding considerations of locality, geometry, and the spatially dependent\ngauge and supersymmetries. We will not impose extra constraints, such as discrete or\ncontinuous flavor symmetries.\n\n4\n\nTwo-generation Models\n\nFor the charged fermion masses of the heaviest two generations there are six dimensionless ratios: m\u03bc /m\u03c4 \u2243 1/17, ms /mb \u2243 1/40, mc /mt \u2243 1/300, Vcb \u2243 1/25, mb /m\u03c4 \u2243\n1, mb /mt \u2243 1/60. We aim to provide a qualitative\nunderstanding of the first four of these\n\u221a\nin terms of the single volume factor \u03b5 \u2261 1/ M\u2217 l, according to m\u03bc /m\u03c4 , ms /mb , Vcb \u2248 \u03b5\nand mc /mt \u2248 \u03b52 . In addition, we begin with requiring that mb /m\u03c4 be precisely understood by the SU(5) mass relation, and explore the most general forms of the Yukawa\nmatrices allowed by locality, without imposing extra constraints. Later we will consider\nthe possibility of relaxing the requirement of precision b \u2212 \u03c4 unification. In Section 5 we\nwill also show the ratio mb /mt \u2243 1/60 can be understood from geometry.\n\nThe up quark mass matrix in SU(5) is proportional to the coefficient of an operator\nbilinear in the Ti fields: Ti Tj . A hierarchy of eigenvalues requires that one T is placed\non a brane and the other in the bulk. The brane localized field has the heaviest up-type\nquark, and is therefore to be identified with the third generation T3 . To have a hope of\n6\n\n\fT3 F3 F2\n\nH5 H5 T2 T'2\n\nO brane\ny=0\n\nO' brane\ny=l\n\nFigure 1: The location of the Higgs and 2nd and 3rd generation matter multiplets. The\nonly alternative is for F 2 to be located at O \u2032 instead of O.\nobtaining the SU(5) relation mb = m\u03c4 at the unification scale, T3 must be on O rather\nthan O \u2032 , so that the placement of the two Ti fields is unique. The up quark Yukawa\ncoupling matrix for the two heavy generations, in the \"locality basis\", is\nU\u2243\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b43\n\u03b42\n\n\u03b42\n.\n\u03b5\n\u0013\n\n(7)\n\nIn this expression \u03b4 corresponds to an SU(5)-violating parameter of the same magnitude\nas the SU(5)-invariant parameter \u03b5. We emphasize that here and below we display only\nthe hierarchical nature of the Yukawa matrices, ignoring the order unity Yukawa couplings of the 5d theory. We conclude that mc /mt is necessarily of order \u03b52 , and that Vcb\nnecessarily contains a piece of order \u03b5 from diagonalization of the up quark sector.\nOne interesting feature of Eq.(7) is that because of the SU(5) violation U is not\nsymmetric as it would be in a 4d SU(5) theory. Also note that the top quark Yukawa\ncoupling has a magnitude proportional to \u03b5. This is not problematic, but shows that the\nhigher dimensional Yukawa coupling is closer to strong coupling than in 4d theories.\nThe operators leading to down quark and charged lepton mass matrices have the\nform Ti F j , leading to the 4d Yukawa matrices Dij and Eji . These matrices will have a\nhierarchy of order \u03b5 on the i index due to the locality of the Ti . Since we require mass\nratios m\u03bc /m\u03c4 , ms /mb \u2248 \u03b5, this implies that there is no additional hierarchy between the\ntwo generations resulting from the index j: F 2 and F 3 must be located on branes of the\nsame dimensionality. Indeed it is well-known that the large hierarchy in the up quark\nsector suggests that, in SU(5) theories, the hierarchy is somehow associated with the Ti\nrather than with the F j . In our scheme this difference has a simple geometrical origin:\nthe Ti reside on branes with a hierarchy of volumes, while the F j do not.\nFor locality to give the SU(5) mb /m\u03c4 mass relation, F 3 must be located on the SU(5)\nbrane O. If it is in the bulk, then b and \u03c4 arise from different SU(5) multiplets F 3 and\n\u2032\nF 3 , so that they have unrelated Yukawa couplings. Hence we are forced to conclude that\nthe b and t Yukawa couplings are both of order \u03b5. Thus in this 5d scheme the large t/b\nmass ratio must arise from a large value for tan \u03b2, the ratio of electroweak VEVs, rather\nthan from volume factors. (At the end of this section we discuss models without precision\nb \u2212 \u03c4 unification where the large mt /mb mass ratio is also explained by geometry.) Thus\nour two generation theory is as shown in Figure 1; the only lack of uniqueness in the\nchoice of location for the second and third generations is whether F 2 resides at O or O \u2032.\nWith F 2,3 both on O, we may relabel the combination which couples to T3 as F 3 ,\n7\n\n\fgiving the Yukawa couplings in the \"locality basis\":\nD\u2243\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b42\n0\n\n\u03b42\n,\n\u03b5\n\u0013\n\nE\u2243\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b42\n\u03b42\n\n0\n.\n\u03b5\n\u0013\n\n(8)\n\nThe weak mixing Vcb also acquires a contribution of order \u03b5 from diagonalization of the\ndown quark sector. These order \u03b5 contributions to quark flavor mixing, from both up\nand down sectors, are simply a reflection of having T2 in the bulk and T3 on the brane.\nEqs.(7) and (8) together lead to\nmc /mt \u2243 \u03b52 , and mb = m\u03c4 ,\n\nm\u03bc /m\u03c4 \u2243 ms /mb \u2243 Vcb \u2243 \u03b5,\n\n(9)\n\nas desired. Indeed, it is remarkable, as can be seen from Figure 1, that so much of the\nflavor structure of the heaviest two generations is so simply understood by the single\ndevice of putting T2 in the bulk. Finally note that there is no change to these results\neven if F 2 is located at O \u2032 . The operator T3 F 2 H is now forbidden by locality, so that\nthe Yukawa matrices again take the form of Eq.(8).\nBefore we discuss neutrino masses, let us mention an interesting variation. While\nthe present configuration gives mb = m\u03c4 , it requires a large tan \u03b2, as mb /mt is not\nvolume-suppressed. However, it is possible to get the right mb /mt without a large tan \u03b2,\nby putting both F 2 and F 3 in the bulk. Since the locations of T 's are unaltered, the\nup-quark mass matrix Eq.(7) stays the same, while the down-quark and lepton matrices\nin Eq.(8) become smaller by a factor of \u03b5, which is good for mb /mt . However, the precise\nSU(5) relation mb = m\u03c4 is lost. We will see how both can be achieved in a 6d model.\n\n4.1\n\nNeutrino masses\n\nNeutrino masses can be generated via the see-saw mechanism if SU(5) singlet fields N are\nintroduced. If the N's are located at a 3-brane, they are expected to acquire Majorana\nmass of order M\u2217 . For bulk N's, contributions to Majorana masses from brane mass\nterms are of order 1/l. In addition to this, we can write down bulk mass terms if we have\nmore than one hypermultiplet in the bulk, which gives masses of order M\u2217 , but here, for\nsimplicity, we assume that these large bulk masses are absent.\nNow, as an interesting example, consider the case of a single N field. With F 2 at\nO, large \u03bd\u03bc \u03bd\u03c4 mixing is inevitable: V\u03bc\u03c4 \u2248 1. The F 2,3 basis is defined by the couplings\nof T3 , so that the two couplings F 2,3 NH will be comparable independent of where N is\nlocated. This is a striking result: so much of the observed pattern of flavor in the heavy\ntwo generations appear to emerge from putting all the matter on the brane with SU(5)\ninvariance, except for the field T2 .3\nIt would be exciting to obtain a neutrino mass enhanced from v 2 /MG by an inverse\npower of \u03b5, corresponding to the measured atmospheric oscillation distance, but this\n3\n\nOn the other hand, if we were to consider models with F 2 and F 3 spatially separated, both small\nand large mixing angle possibilities exist. With N in the bulk V\u03bc\u03c4 \u2248 1, while with N on a brane\nV\u03bc\u03c4 \u2248 \u03b52 . One's naive expectation that quark-lepton unification will give V\u03bc\u03c4 \u2248 Vcb \u2248 \u03b5 turns out not\nto be correct. There is no relation between the mixing of quark doublets (contained in T ) and lepton\ndoublets (contained in F ) because SU(5) allows a different spatial arrangement for the T and F fields.\n\n8\n\n\fdoes not seem to readily occur. One typically gets a suppression: \u03b52 v 2 /MG for bulk N,\nor v 2 /M\u2217 for brane N. Therefore it seems that an additional ingredient is necessary to\nsuppress the Majorana NN mass. For example, with F 3 and N both located on O, the\nNN mass might be suppressed if (B \u2212 L) breaking occurs at O \u2032 and is mediated across\nthe bulk by heavy fields. If a second N field is placed in the bulk it would have a much\nlarger Majorana mass, and would give rise to a correspondingly smaller light neutrino\neigenvalue. On extending the theory to three generations, this eigenvalue can provide the\nsmaller neutrino mass squared difference required for solar neutrino oscillations.\n\n5\n\nThree-generation Models in Six Dimensions\n\nAttractive three generation flavor models where all large hierarchies are explained by\ngeometry can be constructed using a simple extension of the S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) theories\nto 6 dimensions. Specifically consider a 2d \"rectangular\" extra dimensional space with\ncoordinates y1 , y2 formed by the product of two S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) structures at right angles.\nEquivalently this is just a 2d torus T 2 modded out by (Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 )2 . This rectangle has\n4 orbifold 4-branes at its border, O1 along the y1 axis, O2 along the y2 axis, O1\u2032 along\ny2 = l2 , and O2\u2032 along y1 = l1 . We take l2 > l1 .\nThis 6d system has a richer set of possible symmetry structures than the 5d case\ncase. In particular the two sets of orbifold actions, (Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 )1 acting in the y1 direction\nand (Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 )2 acting in the y2 direction, can have different actions in field space:\nA: The most immediate extension of the 5d models is if for each factor, Z2 commutes\nwith SU(5) and Z2\u2032 commutes with only SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1). In this case the O1\nand O2 branes preserve SU(5) with (from a 4d counting) N = 2 SUSY, while the\nO1\u2032 and O2\u2032 branes preserve just SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1). This symmetry structure is\nillustrated in Figure 2A.\nB: Other options arise if we reduce the amount of SU(5) breaking on the orbifold. If\ninstead of equivalent actions in the two directions we change the gauge properties\nof one of the factors so that both Z2 and Z2\u2032 commute with SU(5), we can have\na situation where each 4-brane is SU(5) preserving except O2\u2032 , say, which only\npreserves SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1). This is illustrated in Figure 2B.\nNote that in both cases the bulk possesses the full SU(5) gauge symmetry, but now\nwith N = 2 SUSY from the 6d perspective, equivalent to N = 4 in 4d. This ensures\nthat the 6d bulk theory is free of gauge anomalies [17, 19]. The corners of the rectangle\nare 3-branes which we will identify with our 4-dimensional world. The combination of\norbifold projections at these corners breaks the 6d N = 2 SUSY all the way down to\nN = 1 4d supersymmetry.\nAnother new feature of the 6d case is the possibility of placing in different locations\nthe fields giving rise to zero modes that effectively fill out complete SU(5) multiplets.\nFor example, in the S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) orbifold of Section 4 we needed to have both T2 and\nT2\u2032 fields to realize zero modes of matter in a full 10 of SU(5), and moreover, because\n9\n\n\fO 2 brane\nSU(5)\n\ny1 =0\n\nO'2 brane\nSU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)\n\nSU(5), N=2 6d SUSY\n\nO 2 brane\nSU(5)\n\nA\n\ny1 =l1\ny2=l2\n\nO'1 brane\nSU(5)\n\ny2=0\n\ny2=l2\n\nO 1 brane\nSU(5)\n\nSU(5), N=2 6d SUSY\n\ny1 =l1\n\nO'1 brane\nSU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)\n\nO 1 brane\nSU(5)\n\ny2=0\n\nO'2 brane\nSU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)\n\ny1 =0\n\nB\n\nFigure 2: Two of the possible structures of gauge and SUSY breaking in 6d generalized\nfrom the S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) model in 5d. In both cases all 5d boundary branes possess N = 1\n5d SUSY, while all 4d fixed-brane corners have only 4d N = 1 SUSY.\nthere was only one extended 5d space (the full bulk in this case) they necessarily had\nto be located together. However in both 6d cases illustrated in Figure 2 there are now 4\nfixed branes of spacetime dimensionality 5 on which we can place the matter and explain\nhierarchies by volume factors. In some cases, such as the branes O1 and O2 of structure\nA, or O1 and O1\u2032 of structure B, the full SU(5) symmetry is realized on both branes. In\nsuch cases we are allowed to place, e.g., for structure B, T1 on O1 , while T1\u2032 is located\non O1\u2032 . As we will discuss below this allows us to engineer some interesting \"texture\nzeros\". Alternatively we could utilize matter situated on the branes that do not preserve\nSU(5), but only the SM subgroup. In this situation [16] it is only necessary that SM\nmultiplets are localized to the brane, and there is nothing that forces, say, both the U\nand E components of what was formerly combined in a T to be placed on the same\nbrane, or, as we will see, U 1 to be present at all if we wish to have a massless up-quark.\n(It is also amusing to note that such constructions in orbifold GUT theories allow exotic\nstates with leptoquark quantum numbers in a manner that is naturally consistent with\nthe stringent proton decay and flavor-changing constraints [26].)\nOne worry concerning these 6d models is that the cutoff M\u2217 might not be sufficiently\nfar above the scales 1/l1,2 if the 6d gauge theory quickly becomes strongly \u221a\ncoupled. If\nthis were\n\u221a the case then we would not be able to take the parameters \u03b51 = 1/ M\u2217 l1 and\n\u03b52 = 1/ M\u2217 l2 sufficiently small to be useful in generating the observed flavor hierarchies.\nHowever the usual naive dimensional analysis or RG running estimate of the cutoff scale\nis very dependent on the flat nature of the extra dimensions (with the usual evenly spaced\nKaluza-Klein spectrum). As shown in Ref. [27] the form of the KK spectrum is highly\ndependent on the curvature of the extra dimensional space (apart from the zero modes\nwhich are unaffected since they arise for essentially topological reasons). For example,\nreplacing the g = 1 torus T 2 with a simple 2d compact hyperbolic manifold (CHM)\n10\n\n\fO'2 brane\nl2\n\nO 1 brane\nH5 T1 T'1\n\nl1\n\nO'1 brane\n\nH5 T2 T'2\nF1 F2 F3 T3\n\nO 2 brane\n\nFigure 3: The configuration of the MSSM Higgs and 3 generations of matter multiplets\nin a simple 6D flavor model based on orbifold structure A.\n(genus g > 1 Riemann surfaces) leads to an exponential squeezing of the excited KK\nmodes to high scales. (Specifically, the non-zero-mode KK states have masses that start\nat exp(\u03b1)/l rather than mKK \u223c 1/l, for some \u03b1 which depends on the CHM chosen and\nwhich can easily be O(10).) On the other hand, it is simple to prove that the shape of the\nzero-mode wavefunctions in the extra dimensions is still constant,\n\u221a and the normalization\nfactors for the zero-mode wavefunctions are still given by 1/ M\u2217 l. The raising of the\nexcited KK spectrum raises the scale at which the 6d gauge theory becomes strong, and\nso allows larger values of M\u2217 l.\nWith these general considerations in mind we now turn to the construction of a\nvariety of three-generation flavor models in 6d. As well as the building of an attractive\nmodel our interest is to demonstrate some of the possibilities of the new framework.\n\n5.1\n\nTwo simple 3-generation models with small tan \u03b2\n\nOne simple model based on the symmetry structure A of Figure 2 is depicted in Figure 3.\nAs before, the quark and lepton mass hierarchies arise from the T 's: all three generations\nF 1 , F 2 , F 3 of matter 5's are located at the 4D intersection of O1 and O2 , together with\nthe third generation T3 , ensuring bottom-tau unification. On the other hand, T1 + T1\u2032\nand T2 + T2\u2032 are located on the 5D spaces O1 and O2 , respectively. Finally, H 5 and H5 ,\ncontaining the down-type and up-type Higgs multiplets, also propagate on O1 and O2\nrespectively. This configuration gives rise to the following textures for Yukawa couplings\n\n11\n\n\fO'2 brane\n\nO 1 brane\nH5 H5\nT1 T'1\nF1 F1 '\nF2 F2 '\n\nO'1 brane\n\nT2 F3\nT3\n\nO 2 brane\n\nFigure 4: The configuration of the MSSM Higgs and 3 generations of matter multiplets\nin a simple 6d flavor model based on orbifold structure B.\nin the locality basis:\n\u03b412\n\uf8ec\nU \u2243 \u03b52 \uf8ed \u03b41 \u03b42\n\u03b41\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03b41 0 0\n\u03b41\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(10)\n\u03b42 \uf8f8 , E \u2243 \u03b51 \uf8ed \u03b41 \u03b42 0 \uf8f8 .\n\u03b41 \u03b42 1\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\nHere (\u03b41 , \u03b51 ) and (\u03b42 , \u03b52 ) are volume suppressions of order 1/ M\u2217 l1 and 1/ M\u2217 l2 associated with the spaces O1 and O2 , respectively. As before, the \u03b5's and the 1's in Eq. (10)\nare SU(5) preserving while the \u03b4's are SU(5) violating. Also, we have relabelled F 1 , F 2\nand F 3 such that T3 couples only to F 3 while T2 couples to F 2 and F 3 . Now, by taking\nl1 \u226b l2 , we obtain a mass hierarchy for the light two generations, with the hierarchy\nagain strongest for the up-type quarks. Altogether we have mt : mc : mu \u223c 1 : \u03b422 : \u03b412\nand mb,\u03c4 : ms,\u03bc : md,e \u223c 1 : \u03b42 : \u03b41 . The placement of the Higgs multiplets also introduces\nthe hierarchy \u03bbb /\u03bbt \u223c \u03b41 /\u03b42 , so in this model mb /mt is volume suppressed and large\ntan \u03b2 is not necessary. Also note that we do not have the phenomenologically disfavored\nSU(5) mass relations like md /ms = me /mu , because the light generations propagate on\n4-branes and are sensitive to the orbifold breaking of SU(5). Thus even this quite simple\nmodel has many attractive features.\n\u03b41 \u03b42\n\u03b422\n\u03b42\n\n\u03b41\n\u03b41\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03b42 \uf8f8 , D \u2243 \u03b51 \uf8ed 0\n0\n1\n\n\u03b41\n\u03b42\n0\n\nMuch of the discussion on neutrino masses from Section 4 also carries over here.\nBecause the F 's share the same location, large mixing angles are expected regardless of\nwhere the N's propagate. (The small value of \u03b813 < .15 [23] should in this model arise\nas a mild accidental cancellation.) If each N propagates in the same space, this setup\nprovides a simple realization of the neutrino mass anarchy scenario [24]. As before, the\nMajorana mass for an N localized to the 3-brane may be suppressed by distant breaking\nof (B \u2212 L), and if a different N propagating in the bulk or on a 4-brane has direct\n12\n\n\fcontact with the breaking, it will have a larger Majorana mass, leading to a smaller mass\neigenvalue that could be relevant for solar neutrino oscillations.\nTo illustrate how the gauge symmetry structure of the orbifold can impact flavor\nmodel building, consider another simple model, this time based on structure B (see\nFigure 4). Since the O2 brane now feels no SU(5) breaking from orbifold projections at\n\u2032\neither of its endpoints, it is no longer necessary to include the fields T2\u2032 and F 3 so as\nto give the required SM state. As a consequence this construction gives another method\nof realizing bottom-tau unification even though F 3 propagates on a 4-brane, as there is\njust one 5 state, and thus one Yukawa coupling for both b and \u03c4 . Unwanted SU(5) mass\nrelations are still avoided for the light two generations because F 1 and F 2 contact the 4brane O2\u2032 that only preserves SU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1). By the same token, the Higgs must be\nlocated on the vertical line to get doublet-triplet splitting. As before, mb /mt is suppressed\nby a volume factor. The resulting mass matrices, after appropriately relabelling F 1 and\nF 2 , are\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 2\n\uf8eb 2\n\u03b41 \u03b412 \u03b41 \u03b52\n\u03b41 \u03b41 \u03b52 \u03b41\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n(11)\nU \u2243 \u03b51 \uf8ed \u03b41 \u03b52 \u03b522 \u03b52 \uf8f8 , D \u2243 E T \u2243 \u03b51 \uf8ed 0 \u03b41 \u03b52 \u03b522 \uf8f8 .\n\u03b41 \u03b41\n\u03b52\n\u03b41\n\u03b52\n1\nThus, this model is as attractive as the previous one.\nThese two models are not perfect, however. They lead to \u03b8c \u223c md /ms \u223c me /mu \u223c\n\u03b42 /\u03b41 , when the correct numerical values are \u223c 1/5, 1/20, and 1/200, respectively. Of\ncourse because there are unknown coefficients contained in each element of the Yukawa\nmatrices it is not impossible that these ratios are corrected, but this deviation from our\nphilosophy is unappealing. Nevertheless, the textures of Eqs.(10) and (11) do go a long\nway towards explaining hierarchies of fermion masses and mixings. We now show it is\npossible to build on this basic idea to do better.\n\n5.2\n\nImproved 3-generation models\n\nConsider a variation of the previous A-type model, shown in Figure 5. This demonstrates\nhow texture zeros can arise in our framework (without giving a massless fermion), and\nalso shows how one can improve on some of the mass and mixing-angle relations obtained\nfrom Eq. (10) in the original case. The idea of this model follows from the well-known\nfact that for the light generations of down-type quarks, the texture\nD\u2243\n\n\u0012\n\n0 \u03b4\n,\n\u03b4 1\n\u0013\n\nq\n\n(12)\n\nleads to the successful relation \u03b8c \u223c md /ms rather than \u03b8c \u223c md /ms (provided that\nlarger mixing does not come from the up sector). Moreover, if the E Yukawa texture\nhas the same form, except that its (2,2) entry happens to be somewhat larger, then the\ntexture zero leads to a suppression of the ratio me /m\u03bc relative to md /ms by (D22 /E22 )2 .\nSo if the above form of the Yukawa matrix is generated for D and E, the appropriate\nratios of \u03b8c , md /ms , and me /mu can arise merely from a factor of three difference between\nD22 and E22 [8] which is acceptable in our framework.\n13\n\n\fO'2 brane\n\nO 1 brane\nT1 T'1\n\nO'1 brane\nL1 D1\n\nH5 H5 T2 T2' F2 F2' F3 F3 '\nT3\n\nO 2 brane\n\nFigure 5:qA configuration based on orbifold structure A that gives D11 = E11 = 0, leading\nto \u03b8c \u223c md /ms .\nThe configuration of Figure 5 realizes this texture by spatially separating T1 and F 1 ,\ngiving the Yukawa matrices\n\u03b412\n\uf8ec\nU \u2243 \u03b52 \uf8ed \u03b41 \u03b42\n\u03b41\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b41 \u03b42\n\u03b422\n\u03b42\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03b41\n\uf8f7\n\u03b42 \uf8f8 ,\n1\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec\nT\nD \u2243 E \u2243 \u03b52 \uf8ed \u03b42 \u03b41\n0\n\n\u03b41 \u03b42\n\u03b422\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03b41 \u03b42\n\uf8f7\n\u03b422 \uf8f8 ,\n\u03b42\n\n(13)\n\nin the locality basis. Note that the (1, 1) and (3, 1) entries of D and E T vanish because\nT1 and T3 are localized away from L1 and D 1 . On the other hand the zero in the (3, 2)\nentry of D and E T is just due to the freedom to relabel the combination ofqF 2 and\nF 3 that couples to T3 . Thus this model predicts the desirable relation \u03b8c \u223c ms /ms .\nAnother nice feature of this model is that mb /mt is suppressed by a volume factor since\n\u2032\nF 3 lives on the O2 4-brane. However, precision bottom-tau unification is an accident and\nthe model also predicts mu /mc \u223c md /ms when in fact md /ms is at least a factor \u223c 10\nlarger.\nThis last difficulty is avoided in an interesting way by the model of Figure 6. We have\nremoved T1 and distributed U 1 and E 1 onto O2\u2032 and O1\u2032 respectively. Recall form Tables 1\nand 2 that each T on an SU(5) preserving 4-brane (with at least one SU(5)-violating\nboundary brane) contains massless zero modes only for U and E, while each such T \u2032\ncontains a massless zero mode only for Q, and recall also that O1\u2032 and O2\u2032 preserve just\nSU(3)\u00d7SU(2)\u00d7U(1).

The most striking and interesting feature\nq of this model is that it\nrealizes in a simple way two features, mu = 0 and \u03b8c \u223c md /ms . This is especially\nso because mu = 0 is a solution to the strong CP problem (as U 1 has no Yukawa\ninteractions), which may be consistent with chiral perturbation theory [22]. Moreover,\nthe hierarchy mt /mb is still explained by volume suppression in this model, again because\n\u2032\nF 3 propagates on a 4-brane. Therefore, except for the fact that precision bottom-tau\nunification must still be regarded as a numerical accident, this is a notably successful\nmodel.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have argued that 5 and 6-dimensional supersymmetric orbifold GUT models allow\nan appealing explanation of the observed hierarchical structure of the quark and lepton masses and mixing angles. Our hypothesis is that flavor hierarchies arise from the\ngeometrical suppression of some couplings due to wavefunction normalization factors\nwhen fields propagate in different numbers of dimensions. Moreover, if fields propagate\non different fixed branes, restrictions arising from locality in the extra dimension allow\ninteresting texture zeroes to be simply explained. In addition the detailed nature of the\nSU(5)-breaking orbifold projections lead to simple theories where b \u2212 \u03c4 unification is\nmaintained but similar, disfavored, SU(5) relations for the lighter generations are naturally avoided. We find that simple 5d models based on S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) are strikingly\nsuccessful in explaining many features of the masses and mixing angles of the 2nd and\n3rd generation, this success resulting from the single simple assumption that the only\n15\n\n\fmatter propagating in the 5th dimension is the second generation 10 of SU(5). These\nideas were then extended in Section 5 to successful three generation models of flavor,\nconstructed by generalizing the S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) model to six dimensions on orbifolds with\nstructure T 2 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 )2 . Once again the primary hypothesis leading to attractive models\nwas the distribution of the three generations of 10's, T1 , T2 , T3 on branes of different\nco-dimensionality or linear extent in the extra dimensions. Some novel features of these\nmodels, including a simple mu = 0 configuration leading to a solution of the strong CP\nproblem were also discussed.\nFinally, a valid criticism of our models is that they only give the hierarchical structure\nof the quark and lepton masses and mixing angles and do not allow precise predictions\nbecause of the many unknown O(1) Yukawa couplings of the high-scale theory. In this\nregard our models share features of the Froggert-Nielsen mechanism [9], where such\nuncertainties are also present. We believe that by utilizing further features unique to\nhigher-dimensional GUT theories it is possible to fix many of these O(1) parameters,\nthus leading to a set of precise predictions for relations among the low-energy quark and\nlepton masses and mixing angles [28]. Certainly many interesting issues raised by the\nsuccess of the S 1 /(Z2 \u00d7 Z2\u2032 ) orbifold GUT models and its generalizations remain to be\ninvestigated.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Arthur Hebecker for discussions.
