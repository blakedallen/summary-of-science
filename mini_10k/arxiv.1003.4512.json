However, in only a few cases have transits been detected for any\nof the planets in those systems. Those cases are potentially valuable because the transit\nobservables-the times of conjunction, orbital inclination, and projected spin-orbit angle,\namong others-provide a much more complete description of a planetary system, which may\nin turn give clues about its formation and evolution. The Corot-7 system has two orbiting\nsuper-Earths, one of which transits (L\u00e9ger et al. 2009, Queloz et al. 2009). The HAT-P-7\nsystem has a transiting hot Jupiter in a polar or retrograde orbit, as well as a longer-period\ncompanion that could be a planet or a star (P\u00e1l et al. 2008, Winn et al. 2009, Narita et\nal. 2010). The HAT-P-13 system, the subject of this paper, features a G4 dwarf star with\ntwo previously known orbiting companions (Bakos et al. 2009). The inner companion (HATP-13b, or simply \"b\" hereafter) is a transiting hot Jupiter in a 2.9 day orbit. The outer\ncompanion (\"c\") has an eccentric 1.2 yr orbit and a minimum mass (Mc sin ic ) of about 15\nJupiter masses, although its true mass (Mc ) and orbital inclination (ic ) are unknown. In\nparticular, transits of companion c have neither been observed nor ruled out.\nBatygin, Bodenheimer, & Laughlin (2009) and Mardling (2010) showed that it may be\npossible to use the observed state of the system to determine planet b's Love number k2 , a\nparameter that depends on the planet's interior density distribution. This would be of great\ninterest, as few other methods exist for investigating the interior structure of exoplanets.\nThe method is based on the theoretical expectation that tidal evolution has aligned the\napsides of the orbits of b and c. This method has not yet yielded meaningful constraints on\nk2 , partly because of the large uncertainty in the eccentricity of b's orbit. Another relevant\nparameter is the mutual inclination between the orbits, which is not known at all.\nRadial-velocity observations are usually powerless to determine mutual inclinations,\nunless the planets are in a mean-motion resonance (see, e.g., Correia et al. 2010). However,\nfor a transiting planet it is possible to assess the alignment between the orbit and the stellar\nequator through the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. A system with mutually inclined\nplanetary orbits might also be expected to have large angles between the orbits and the\nstellar equator. In particular, Mardling (2010) presented a formation scenario for HAT-P-13\ninvolving gravitational scattering by a putative third companion, which could have caused\nlarge mutual inclinations and a large stellar obliquity.\nIn this paper we present new radial-velocity measurements of HAT-P-13 bearing on all\nthese issues. The new data are presented in \u00a7 2. Our analysis is presented \u00a7 3, and includes\nevidence for a third companion \"d\" (\u00a7 3.1), refined estimates of the eccentricity and apsidal\norientation of b's orbit (\u00a7 3.2), modeling of the RM effect (\u00a7 3.3), and updated predictions\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nfor the next inferior conjunction (possible transit window) of companion c (\u00a7 3.4). In \u00a7 4 we\ndiscuss the implications for further dynamical investigations of HAT-P-13.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe observed HAT-P-13 with the High Resolution Spectrograph (HIRES; Vogt et al. 1994)\non the Keck I 10m telescope, using the same instrument settings and observing protocols that\nwere used by Bakos et al. (2009) and that are used by the California Planet Search (Howard\net al. 2009). In particular, we used the iodine gas absorption cell to calibrate the instrumental point-spread function and the wavelength scale. The total number of new spectra is 75,\nwhich are added to the 30 spectra presented by Bakos et al. (2009). Of the new spectra, 40\nwere obtained on the night of 2009 Dec 27-28, spanning a transit of HAT-P-13b, and were\ngathered to measure the RM effect. The other 35 were obtained on arbitrary nights. They\nextend the timespan of the data set by approximately 1 yr, and thereby help to refine the\norbital parameters.\nThe radial velocity (RV) of each spectrum was measured with respect to an iodine-free\ntemplate spectrum, using the algorithm of Butler et al. (1996) with subsequent improvements. All of the spectra obtained by Bakos et al. (2009) were re-reduced, for consistency.\nMeasurement errors were estimated from the scatter in the fits to individual spectral segments spanning 2 \u00c5. The RVs are given in Table 1, and plotted as a function of time in\nFigures 1-2. The model curves appearing in those figures are explained in \u00a7 3.\n\n3.\n\nAnalysis\n\nOur model for the radial-velocity data took the form\nVcalc (t) = Vb (t) + Vc (t) + VRM (t) + \u03b3 + \u03b3\u0307(t \u2212 t0 ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Vcalc is the calculated RV, Vb and Vc are the radial velocities of non-interacting Keplerian orbits, VRM is the transit-specific \"anomalous velocity\" due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffect (\u00a7 3.3), and {\u03b3, \u03b3\u0307, t0 } are constants. The first constant, \u03b3, specifies the velocity offset between the system barycenter and the arbitrary template spectrum that was used to\ncalculate RVs. The second constant, \u03b3\u0307, allows for a constant radial acceleration, and was\nincluded because models with \u03b3\u0307 = 0 did not fit the data (\u00a7 3.1). We interpret \u03b3\u0307 as the\nacceleration produced by a newly-discovered long-period companion \"d\". The third constant, t0 , is an arbitrary reference time that was taken to be the time of the first RV datum\n(BJD 2,454,548.80650).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Radial velocity variation of HAT-P-13. Top.-Measured RVs, and the bestfitting model. The model consisted of two Keplerian orbits and did not allow for any additional acceleration (\u03b3\u0307 \u2261 0). Bottom.-Residuals. The poorness of the fit, and the pattern of\nresiduals, are evidence for a third companion.\nOur RM model was based on that of Winn et al. (2005), in which simulated spectra\nare used to calibrate the relation between the phase of the transit and the measured radial\nvelocity. For this case we used the relation\n\"\n\u0012\n\u00132 #\nvp (t)\n\u2206V (t) = \u2212(v sin i\u22c6 ) \u03b4(t) 0.9833 \u2212 0.0356\n,\n(2)\nv sin i\u22c6\nwhere v sin i\u22c6 is the sky-projected stellar rotation speed, \u03b4 is the fractional loss of light, and\nvp is the radial velocity of the portion of the stellar photosphere that is hidden by the planet.\nTo calculate vp we assumed that the stellar photosphere rotates uniformly with an angle \u03bb\nbetween the sky projections of the spin vector and the orbital angular momentum vector\n(see, e.g., Ohta et al. 2005 or Gaudi & Winn 2007).\nSince \u03b4 depends on the planet-to-star radius ratio Rp /R\u22c6 , orbital inclination i, and\nimpact parameter btra , all of which are more tightly bounded by observations of photometric\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Radial velocity variation of HAT-P-13. Top.-Measured RVs, and the bestfitting model, this time allowing for a constant radial acceleration (\u03b3\u0307) in addition to two\nKeplerian orbits. The best fitting value of \u03b3\u0307 was 17.5 m s\u22121 yr\u22121 . Bottom.-Residuals.\ntransits than by the RM effect, we simultaneously fitted a composite i\u2032 -band transit light\ncurve based on the photometric data of Bakos et al. (2009). For the photometric model we\nassumed a quadratic limb-darkening law and used the analytic formula of Mandel & Agol\n(2002), as implemented by P\u00e1l (2008). Because the photometric data are not precise enough\nto constrain both of the limb-darkening coefficients u1 and u2 , we fixed u2 \u2261 0.3251, the\nvalue obtained by interpolating the Claret (2004) tables, and allowed u1 to vary freely.1 For\nthe RM model, we used a linear law with a fixed coefficient of 0.72, as appropriate for the\nV -band, the approximate spectral range from which the RV signal is drawn.\nAll together there were 18 adjustable parameters, of which 12 were controlled almost\nexclusively by the RV data, and 6 by the photometric data. The data set had 105 RVs and\n107 flux data points. Thus, the total number of degrees of freedom was 194, of which 93\n1\n\nThe result, u1 = 0.269 \u00b1 0.076, was consistent with the tabulated value of 0.3068.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\npertained to RVs and 101 to photometry.\nWe determined the best-fitting parameter values and their 68.3% confidence limits with\na Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm that we have described elsewhere (see, e.g., Winn\net al. 2007). Uniform priors were adopted for all parameters except for b's time of transit\nand orbital period, for which we adopted Gaussian priors based on the ephemeris of Bakos\net al. (2009). We doubled the quoted errors in the ephemeris, out of concern that systematic\nerrors or transit-timing variations have affected the results. The likelihood was taken to be\nexp(\u2212\u03c72 /2) with\n2\n\n\u03c7 =\n\n\u00152\n105 \u0014\nX\nvi (obs) \u2212 vi (calc)\n\u03c3i\n\ni=1\n\n+\n\n\u00152\n107 \u0014\nX\nfj (obs) \u2212 fj (calc)\nj=1\n\n\u03c3j\n\n= \u03c72v + \u03c72f ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere vi (obs) and \u03c3i are the RV data and associated uncertainties, vi (calc) are the calculated\nRVs; fj (obs) and \u03c3j are the flux data and associated uncertainties; and fj (calc) are the\ncalculated fluxes.\nEach flux uncertainty \u03c3i was taken to be the scatter in the \u224816 data points contributing\nto each 4 min time bin. Each RV uncertainty \u03c3j was taken to be the quadrature sum of the\ninternally-estimated measurement error and a \"jitter\" term of 3.4 m s\u22121 . The jitter term was\nset by the requirement \u03c72v = 93, the relevant number of degrees of freedom, and is consistent\nwith the empirical jitter estimates of Wright (2005) for stars similar to HAT-P-13. In the\nbest-fitting model, \u03c72f = 109.5 and \u03c72v = 93.0, the rms photometric residual was 470 ppm\nand the rms RV residual was 3.6 m s\u22121 .\nTable 2 gives the results for the parameter values. Figure 3 shows the RVs as a function\nof the orbital phases of b and c, expressed in days. In the left panel, the RVs are plotted\nas a function of the orbital phase of b, after subtracting the calculated contributions to the\nRV from companions c and d. (The contribution due to d is a linear function of time.)\nLikewise, the right panel of Figure 3 shows the RVs as a function of the orbital phase of c,\nafter subtracting the calculated contributions from b and d.

The pattern of residuals is displayed in Figure 1. There are large and time-correlated\nresiduals that are not easily attributed to stellar jitter or underestimated measurement errors.\nIn contrast, when \u03b3\u0307 was allowed to vary freely, the best-fitting model had \u03b3\u0307 = 17.5 m s\u22121 yr\u22121 ,\nand \u03c72v = 93 with 93 degrees of freedom. The exact match between \u03c72v and Ndof,v is not significant in itself, as it follows from our choice of 3.4 m s\u22121 for the jitter term. However, it\nis significant that an acceptable fit was found for a choice of jitter term that is in line with\nobservations of similar stars. Even more significant is that the correlated pattern of residuals\nvanished. As shown in Figure 2, the residuals scattered randomly around zero.\nThe failure of the two-Keplerian model, and the success of a model with an additional\nradial acceleration, is evidence for a third companion to HAT-P-13 (\"d\") with a long orbital\nperiod. With the limited information available, though, the properties of d are largely\nunknown. Assuming its orbit to be nearly circular, and its mass to be much smaller than\nthat of the star, we may set \u03b3\u0307 \u223c GMd sin id /a2d to give an order-of-magnitude constraint\n\u0012\n\u0013\nMd sin id \u0010 ad \u0011\u22122\n\u223c 9.8,\n(4)\nMJup\n10 AU\n\nwhere ad is the orbital distance. By this standard, the newly discovered object could be a\n2.5 MJup planet at 5 AU, or a 10 MJup planet at 10 AU, or a 90 MJup (0.09 M\u2299 ) star at\n30 AU, etc. The properties of d could be substantially different depending on its eccentricity,\nargument of pericenter, and time of conjunction. Orbits closer than \u223c5 AU would be subject\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Transit photometry and radial-velocity variation.

We experimented\nwith models that include a \"jerk\" parameter, \u03b3\u0308, finding this parameter to be highly covariant\nwith the mass, orbital period, and eccentricity of c. More elaborate models and detailed\nconstraints on companion d will only be justified after another few years of observing, when\nthe properties of companion c will have been well established. The uncertainties given in\nTable 2 must therefore be understood as subject to the assumption that d is producing no\nsignificant RV curvature.\n\n3.2.\n\nOrbital eccentricities\n\nFigure 5 shows the results for the orbital eccentricities. Planet c's orbit is strongly\neccentric, with ec = 0.6616 \u00b1 0.0054. Planet b's orbit is nearly circular, with eb = 0.0133 \u00b1\n0.0041. To assess the significance of the detection of eccentricity, it is simpler to examine\nthe components of the eccentricity vector because they obey Gaussian distributions, while\ne obeys a Rayleigh distribution (see, e.g., Shen & Turner 2008). We found eb cos \u03c9b =\n\u22120.0099 \u00b1 0.0036 (i.e., nonzero with 2.8\u03c3 significance) and ec sin \u03c9c = \u22120.0060 \u00b1 0.0069. The\neccentricity of b's orbit is right on the edge of detectability.2\nBecause of the low significance of this detection, it is impossible to draw a firm conclusion\nabout whether its orbit is aligned with that of companion c. Our result is \u2206\u03c9 \u2261 \u03c9b \u2212 \u03c9c =\n36+27\n\u221236 degrees. The red dashed lines in Figure 5 show the 3\u03c3 allowed region for \u03c9c . The lines\nintersect the allowed region for planet b, as shown in the right panel. Most of the uncertainty\nin \u2206\u03c9 arises from the poorly determined orientation of b's orbit.3\nThe best way to check on the eccentricity of b's orbit would be to observe an occultation\nwith the Spitzer Space Telescope. The timing of occultations would allow eb cos \u03c9b to be determined with an accuracy of about 0.001, several times better than the RV result. However,\neven after such an observation, considerable uncertainty would remain in \u2206\u03c9 because the\naccuracy in eb sin \u03c9b would not be much improved.\n2\n\nFor this reason the results are also sensitive to the choice of priors for the fitting parameters. The results\ndescribed in this section and given in Table 2 are based on uniform priors for eb cos \u03c9b and eb sin \u03c9b . If\ninstead uniform priors are adopted for eb and \u03c9b , then we find eb = 0.0119 \u00b1 0.0040.\n3\n\nIf we assume the orbits are apsidally locked, and repeat the fitting procedure with the requirement\n\u2206\u03c9 = 0, we find eb = 0.0104 \u00b1 0.0032.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.- Results for the orbital eccentricities. The middle panel displays the results\nfor b and c, while the left and right panels zoom in on the results each object. The contours\nenclose 68%, 95%, and 99.73% of the MCMC samples. The dashed lines show the 99.73%\nconfidence range for the apsidal orientation of c's orbit; they allow a visual assessment of\nthe degree of apsidal alignment, and show that the limiting uncertainty in \u2206\u03c9 is the large\nuncertainty in eb sin \u03c9b .\n3.3.\n\nThe Rossiter-McLaughlin effect\n\nThe RV data obtained during transits exhibit a prograde Rossiter-McLaughlin effect:\nan anomalous redshift for the first half of the transit, followed by an anomalous blueshift for\nthe second half. The fit to the data is shown in Figure 4, and the resulting constraints on \u03bb\nand v sin i\u22c6 are shown in Figure 6. The finding of \u03bb = 1.9 \u00b1 8.6 deg implies a close alignment\nbetween the rotational angular momentum of the star, and the orbital angular momentum\nof the planet, at least as projected on the sky. Our result for the projected stellar rotation\nvelocity, v sin i\u22c6 = 1.66 \u00b1 0.37 km s\u22121 , is about 1\u03c3 smaller than the result of 2.9 \u00b1 1.0 km s\u22121\nreported by Bakos et al. (2009).\n\n3.4.\n\nInferior conjunction of planet c\n\nIt is not yet known whether the inclination of c's orbit is close enough to 90\u25e6 for transits\nto occur. Observations of transits would reveal the mass and radius of the companion, allow\na more precise characterization of its orbit, and place constraints on the mutual inclination\nof orbits b and c.\nUsing our results we predicted the times of inferior conjunctions of planet c, which is\nwhen transits would occur. The accuracy of the predicted time is limited by correlations\nwith the uncertainties in c's velocity semiamplitude and eccentricity (see Figure 7).

The quoted uncertainties represent 1\u03c3 (68.3%) confidence levels. It would\nbe prudent to keep the star under continuous photometric surveillance for the entire 3\u03c3 time\nrange, at least. The maximum transit duration is 14.9 hr.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nHAT-P-13 was already a noteworthy system, as the first known case of a star with a\ntransiting planet and a second close companion. We have presented evidence for a third\ncompanion in the form of a long-term radial acceleration of the star. The properties of the\nnewly discovered long-period companion will remain poorly known until additional RV data\nare gathered over a significant fraction of its orbital period. Our analysis of the RossiterMcLaughlin effect shows that planet b's orbital axis is aligned with the stellar rotation axis,\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- Results for the timing of the inferior conjunction of companion c, based\non our MCMC analysis of the RV data.

The contours represent 68%, 95%,\nand 99.73% confidence limits.\nas projected on the sky. Our new data also agree with the previous finding that the orbit of\nplanet b is slightly eccentric.\nThe latter two findings are relevant to the second reason why HAT-P-13 is noteworthy:\nits orbital configuration may represent an example of two-planet tidal evolution. In this scenario, first envisioned by Wu & Goldreich (2002) and investigated further by Mardling (2007),\ntidal circularization of the inner planet's orbit is delayed due to gravitational interactions\nwith the outer planet. The interactions drive the system into a state of apsidal alignment,\nwhere it remains as both orbits are slowly circularized. As it turned out, the specific planetary system that inspired Wu & Goldreich (2002) was irrelevant to their theory, because the\n\"outer planet\" was found to be a spurious detection (Butler et al. 2002).\nBatygin et al. (2009) welcomed HAT-P-13 as a genuine system that followed the path\npredicted by Wu & Goldreich (2002), and with the additional virtue that the inner planet is\ntransiting. For this interpretation to be valid, the apsides of b and c must be aligned, whereas\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nwe have found the angle between the apsides to be 36+27\n\u221236 deg, differing from zero by 1\u03c3. We\ndo not consider this result to be significant enough to draw a firm conclusion, especially in\nlight of the uncertainties due to the ad hoc stellar jitter term and our simplified treatment of\nthe influence of companion d. Further RV monitoring and observations of occultations are\nneeded to make progress.\nBatygin et al. (2009) also showed that the existence of transits would allow for an\nempirical estimate of the tidal Love number k2 of planet b, as mentioned in \u00a7 1. The\nrequirement that the apsidal precession rates of b and c are equal leads to a condition on k2 ,\nbecause b's precession rate is significantly affected by its tidal bulge. Subsequent work by\nMardling (2010) showed that for a unique determination of k2 it is necessary for the mutual\ninclination \u2206i between orbits b and c to be small. If instead the orbits are mutually inclined,\nthen tidal evolution drives the system into a state in which eb and \u2206i undergo oscillations:\na cycle in parameter space, instead of a fixed point. Furthermore, Mardling (2010) argued\nthat a large mutual inclination should be considered plausible, or even likely, given c's high\neccentricity. She proposed that b and c began with nearly circular and coplanar orbits, but\nc's orbit was strongly perturbed by an interaction with a hypothetical outer planet. Those\nsame perturbations would likely have tilted c's orbit.\nThe relation, if any, between the newly-discovered HAT-P-13d and Mardling's hypothetical outer planet is unclear. In her scenario, the outer planet is ejected from the system.\nThis seems important to the scenario, as otherwise d would continue interacting with c, and\ninterfere with the tidal evolution of b and c. Thus, unless d's pericenter was somehow raised\nto avoid further encounters with c, it does not seem likely to have played the role envisioned\nby Mardling (2010). Of course the scenario could still be correct even if the third companion\nd was not the scattering agent; a fourth (ejected) companion may have been responsible.\nOur study of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect pertains to the angle \u03c8\u22c6,b between planet b's\norbit and the stellar equator, and has no direct bearing on the angle \u2206i between the orbital\nplanes of b and c. However, there is an indirect connection, through the nodal precession\nthat would be caused by mutually inclined orbits. As shown by Mardling (2010), planet\nb is far enough from the star that its orbital precession rate is likely to be dominated by\nthe torque from c, rather than the quadrupole moment J2 of the star. The critical orbital\ndistance inside which the stellar torque is dominant is \u223c(2J2 a2c Mc /M\u22c6 )0.2 (Burns 1986),\nwhich is 0.020 AU assuming J2 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 as for the Sun. This is smaller than the actual\norbital distance of 0.043 AU. Hence if \u2206i were large, then b's orbit would nodally precess\naround c's orbital axis, which would cause periodic variations in \u03c8\u22c6,b . Therefore, at any given\nmoment in the system's history, we would be unlikely to observe a small value of \u03c8\u22c6,b unless\n\u2206i were small. However, it is impossible to draw firm conclusions about \u2206i because of the\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ndependence on initial conditions, the possible effects of companion d, and the fact that only\nthe sky-projected angle \u03bb is measured rather than the true obliquity \u03c8\u22c6,b .\nIt may be possible to estimate \u2206i based on transit timing variations of planet b (Nesvorn\u00fd\n& Beaug\u00e9 2010; Bakos et al. 2009). An even more direct estimate of \u2206i could be achieved\nif transits of c were detected. The existence of transits would show that ic is nearly 90\u25e6 , as\nis ib . This would suggest \u2206i is small, although it would still be possible that the orbits are\nmisaligned and their line of nodes happens to lie along the line of sight. The most definitive result would be obtained by observing the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during transits\nof c, and comparing c's value of \u03bb with that of planet b. In effect, the rotation axis of the\nstar would be used as a reference line from which the orientation of each orbit is measured\n(Fabrycky 2009). This gives additional motivation to observe HAT-P-13 throughout the\nupcoming conjunctions of companion c.\nWe thank Dan Fabrycky for helpful conversations, especially about the dynamical implications of our results.
