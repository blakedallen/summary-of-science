Introduction\nIn the last few decades there has been considerable interest in the nature of the\nphase diagram of the two-dimensional (2-d) fully frustrated XY (FFXY) model, whose\nHamiltonian is [1]\nX\nHFFXY = \u2212J\ncos(\u03b8x \u2212 \u03b8y + Axy ).\n(1)\nhxyi\n\nHere J > 0, the angle variables \u03b8x are defined on the sites of a regular 2-d lattice, the\nsummation is over nearest-neighbor pairs, and the quantities Axy are fixed and satisfy\nP\nthe constraint\nAxy = \u03c0 around each plaquette. The FFXY model is experimentally\nrelevant for Josephson-junction arrays in a magnetic field. It should describe the\nsuperconducting-to-normal transition at half a flux quantum per plaquette, see, e.g.,\nRefs. [2, 3, 4] and references therein.\nAs a consequence of frustration, the ground state of the FFXY model presents an\nO(2)\u2297Z2 degeneracy [1]. While the O(2) degeneracy is the usual one and is related to\nthe O(2) global invariance of the Hamiltonian that is broken in the low-temperature (LT)\nphase, the additional Z2 degeneracy [1, 5]. A variable that distinguishes the different\nground states is the chirality [1], which is defined by\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nX\nsin(\u03b8x \u2212 \u03b8y + Axy )\uf8fb ,\n(2)\n\u03c7n = sign \uf8f0\nhxyi\u2208\u03a0n\n\nwhere \u03a0n is a lattice plaquette and n is the dual-lattice site at its center. At\nzero temperature there are two degenerate ground states related by a global flip of\nthe chiral variables \u03c7n . Therefore, the staggered chirality magnetization defines an\norder parameter related to the chiral Z2 symmetry, which competes with the spin\nmagnetization in determining the phase diagram and critical behavior of the FFXY\nmodel. Much work has been dedicated to the study of the phase diagram of the FFXY\nand related models that have the same ground-state degeneracy [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,\n13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,\n37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60,\n61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]. In spite of that, there is not yet\na general consensus on the critical behavior of these systems. In this paper, we address\nagain this issue and, by performing simulations on very large lattices and by means of\na careful finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis of the results, we provide what we believe is\nthe definite answer on this problem.\nTwo scenarios have been put forward for the critical behavior of the FFXY and\nrelated 2-d models. In one of them the system undergoes two transitions as temperature\ndecreases. First, chiral modes undergo an Ising-type transition at Tch , characterized by\nthe onset of chiral long-range order while spins remain paramagnetic. Then, at a lower\ntemperature Tsp , spin modes exhibit a transition to a phase with quasi-long-range order,\nwhich coexists with the long-range order of the chiral modes. This second transition\nis expected to belong to the same universality class as the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT)\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n3\n\ntransition in the standard 2-d XY model [76, 77]. In this scenario spin and chiral modes\ndecouple and order at different temperatures. This scenario is supported by arguments\nbased on a kink-antikink unbinding picture [68, 74]. A second possibility is that spin and\nchirality order at the same temperature, Tc , where both chiral long-range order and spin\nquasi-long-range order set in simultaneously. In this case spin and chiral modes may\nbe coupled at the transition and may give rise to a qualitatively new critical behavior.\nTherefore, one may observe values of the chiral critical exponents that differ from the\nIsing ones, \u03bd = 1 and \u03b7 = 1/4. Field-theoretical calculations within the corresponding\nLandau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) theory [65, 70] support the existence of such a new\nuniversality class.\nPrevious results are presented in Table 1. We report results for the fully frustrated\nXY model on the square lattice (FFXYsq ) and on the triangular lattice (FFXYtr ),\nand also for some generalizations: a model with next-to-nearest\u2013neighbor interactions\n(FFXYnn+nnn ), a nearest-neighbor model with Villain Hamiltonian, and XY models\nin which frustration is induced by the competition of nearest-neighbor and nextto-nearest\u2013neighbor interactions (FXYJ1 ,J2 ) or by a zig-zag pattern of ferromagnetic\nand antiferromagnetic couplings (FXYzz ). We also include results for some related\nmodels that have the same ground-state degeneracy: the fractional-charge Coulomb-gas\n(CG) model that is obtained from the FFXY model by the usual duality mapping, a\nmodel with two coupled XY fields (2cXY) or with an Ising and XY field (IsXY), the\nantiferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-plane exchange anisotropy on the triangular\nlattice (FFXXZtr ), the frustrated antiferromagnetic six-state clock model on a triangular\nlattice (FA6SC), the 19-vertex model, the quantum ladder of Josephson junctions\n(QLJJ), the solid-on-solid model coupled to the Ising model (SOS-Is), and the\ncorresponding LGW \u03c64 theory. In Table 1 we report the method that has been employed\nto investigate the phase diagram, the number of transitions that are observed (whenever\nthere are two transitions, we also give the difference of the critical temperatures) and the\nestimates of the critical exponents at the chiral transition. Most of the results have been\nobtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. But we should also mention transfer-matrix\n(TM) and real-space renormalization-group (RG) calculations, as well as perturbative\nfield-theoretical (FT) analyses. Note that most MC studies focussed on the finitesize behavior at criticality; only in a few cases [30, 33, 43, 47] was the temperature\ndependence investigated in the large-volume limit. In some cases the critical behavior\nwas investigated by studying the nonequilibrium relaxation (NER) at criticality.\nThe results summarized in Table 1 are rather contradictory. The most recent MC\nsimulations favor the existence of two transitions. If this is correct, the results of the MC\nsimulations observing only one transition may be reasonably explained by noting that\nthe two transitions are very close and that high accuracy is required to disentangle them.\nIf there are two transitions, chiral and spin modes decouple and thus one expects Ising\nbehavior at the chiral transition. But this is not supported by numerical simulations\nthat have found \u03bd \u2248 0.8 in most cases. To explain this result, one may conclude that\nthere is a single transition that belongs to a new universality class. In this case, the\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n4\n\nobservation of two very close transitions might be explained by uncontrolled systematic\nerrors in the analysis of the MC data. Of course, it is also possible, as discussed in\nRefs. [40, 47, 67], that the departure of the chiral exponents from the Ising values is\ndue to a slow crossover towards the Ising asymptotic behavior, somehow caused by the\ninteraction with the spin modes, which will eventually give rise to a KT transition.\nHowever, this argument does not explain why the same estimate \u03bd \u2248 0.8 is obtained in\nseveral different models. Finally, there is a third, less conventional possibility: There\nare two transitions, but the chiral transition does not belong to the Ising universality\nclass for some unknown reasons.\nIn this paper we study the phase diagram of the 2-d square-lattice FFXY and of\ntwo related models, a coupled Ising-XY (IsXY) model and a \u03c64 model obtained from a\nstraighforward lattice discretization of the LGW Hamiltonian for the critical modes of\nthe FFXY model, see, e.g., Refs. [29, 5]. We present MC simulations on square lattices\nL \u00d7 L, up to L = O(103 ). The phase diagrams and critical behaviors are obtained by\nmeans of a FSS analysis of the MC results. Short reports already appeared in Ref. [78].\nIn the LT phase the Z2 chiral symmetry is broken and the spin degrees of freedom show\nthe same quasi-long-range order as in the 2-d XY model. We conclusively show that the\nsquare-lattice FFXY model undergoes two very close but separate transitions: a KT and\nthen, as temperature increases, an Ising transition with \u03b4 \u2261 (Tch \u2212 Tsp )/Tch = 0.0159(2).\nThe same transition pattern is observed in the \u03c64 and IsXY models when the transitions\nare continuous.\nBeside confirming the two-transition scenario, we have also observed an unexpected\ncrossover behavior that is universal to some extent. In the FFXY model and in the \u03c64\nand IsXY models in a large parameter region, the finite-size behavior at the chiral and\nspin transitions is model independent, apart from a length rescaling. In particular, the\nuniversal approach to the Ising regime at the chiral transition is nonmonotonic for most\nobservables, and there is a wide region in which the finite-size behavior is controlled\n(c)\n(c)\nby an effective exponent \u03bdeff \u2248 0.8. This occurs for L <\n\u223c \u03bes , where \u03bes is the spin\ncorrelation length at the chiral transition, which is usually large in these models; for\n(c)\nexample, \u03bes = 118(1) in the square-lattice FFXY model. This explains why many\nprevious studies that considered smaller lattices always found \u03bd \u2248 0.8. This universal\nbehavior may be explained by the presence of a multicritical point, where chiral and\nspin modes are both critical. As far as its nature is concerned, our numerical data at the\nchiral transition suggest a zero-temperature multicritical point. In this case, a possible\ncandidate is the O(4) multicritical point that is present in the \u03c64 lattice model and\ncontrols the low-temperature phase of the 4-vector model.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we define the models investigated in\nthis paper. The thermodynamic quantities considered in this study are introduced in\nSec. 3.

Models\nThe Hamiltonian of the square-lattice FFXY model is\nX\nHFFXY = \u2212J\njxy ~sx * ~sy ,\n\n(3)\n\nhxyi\n\nwhere the two-component spins ~sx satisfy ~sx * ~sx = 1, jxy = 1 along all horizontal\nlines, while along vertical lines ferromagnetic jxy = 1 and antiferromagnetic jxy = \u22121\ncouplings alternate. Here (as in the following models) J plays the role of inverse\ntemperature, the Gibbs probability being simply proportional to e\u2212HFFXY .\nWe also consider the \u03c64 model on a square lattice. The Hamiltonian is\nX\u0002\nX\n\u0003\n~ i,x * \u03c6\n~ i,y +\n\u03c6\n\u03c62i,x + U(\u03c62i,x \u2212 1)2\nH\u03c6 = \u2212 J\nhxyi,i\n\n+ 2(U + D)\n\nX\n\ni,x\n\n\u03c621,x \u03c622,x ,\n\n(4)\n\nx\n\n~ i,x is a real two-component variable, the first sum goes over all nearestwhere i = 1, 2, \u03c6\n~i * \u03c6\n~ i . Hamiltonian H\u03c6 describes two identical O(2)-symmetric\nneighbor pairs, and \u03c62i \u2261 \u03c6\nmodels coupled by an energy-energy term. This model is a straightforward lattice\ndiscretization of the LGW Hamiltonian\nZ\ni 1 \u0010 X \u00112 1\no\nn1 X h\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6a )2 + r\u03c62a + u0\n\u03c62a + v0 \u03c621 \u03c622 (5)\nHLGW = dd x\n2 a=1,2\n4!\n4\na=1,2\n\n(\u03c6a , a = 1, 2, is a two-component vector), which can be obtained by applying a HubbardStratonovich transformation to the FFXY model, dropping terms of order higher than\nfour [29, 9, 5]. Therefore, the lattice \u03c64 model (4) represents an effective ferromagnetic\ntheory that is expected to describe the critical modes of the FFXY model. This approach\nwas already used to investigate the critical behavior of antiferromagnets on a stacked\ntriangular lattice [79].\nIt is interesting to note that the symmetry of Hamiltonian (4) is larger than that\nof the FFXY model. Indeed, the Hamiltonian is symmetric under separate rotations\nof the two fields and under the Z2 transformation \u03c61 \u2194 \u03c62 . Therefore, the overall\nsymmetry is [O(2)\u2295O(2)]\u2297Z2 . For D > 0 the ground state corresponds to \u03c621 = 0 and\n\u03c622 6= 0 or the opposite, and thus it has the same degeneracy as the ground state of\nthe FFXY model. Indeed, the lowest-energy configurations are determined once one\nfixes which field does not vanish-thereby breaking the Z2 interchange symmetry-and\nthe direction of the nonvanishing one. Thus, the relation between the FFXY model\nand the \u03c64 Hamiltonian is not fixed by the symmetry of the original Hamiltonian but\nrather by the ground-state degeneracy group, which is the quotient of the symmetry\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n7\n\ngroups of the model and of the ground state. This is consistent with the paradigm that\nrelates the universality class to the symmetry breaking pattern. Note that the extended\nsymmetry of the LGW Hamiltonian is related to the truncation of the Hamiltonian to\nfourth order in the fields and it is lost if higher-order terms are added. More precisely,\nthe Hubbard-Stratonovich calculation gives rise to \u03c66 and \u03c68 terms on the triangular\nand square lattice respectively, which break the O(2)\u2295O(2) symmetry down to O(2)\n[5]. These terms are irrelevant close to four dimensions but it is far from clear that the\nsame holds in two dimensions. In any case, they do not change the relevant symmetry\nbreaking pattern.\nDue to the ground-state structure, for J \u2192 \u221e the field-interchange symmetry\n\u03c61 \u2194 \u03c62 is broken and thus this symmetry is the analog of the Z2 chiral symmetry of\nthe FFXY model. The corresponding order parameter is\nCx = \u03c621,x \u2212 \u03c622,x .\n\n(6)\n\nFor D = 0 model (4) is O(4) symmetric. Therefore, it does not have any transition at\nfinite temperature. Criticality is observed only for J \u2192 \u221e. In this limit the correlation\nlength \u03be increases exponentially, i.e. \u03be \u223c ecJ ; see, e.g., Ref. [80].\nWe also consider the Ising-XY (IsXY) model [26]\n\u0015\nX \u0014J\n(1 + \u03c3x \u03c3y ) ~sx * ~sy + C\u03c3x \u03c3y ,\n(7)\nHIsXY = \u2212\n2\nhxyi\n\nwhere \u03c3x = \u00b11 and the two-component spins ~sx satisfy ~sx * ~sx = 1. Here ~sx and \u03c3x\ncorrespond to spin and chiral variables, respectively. Note that, by performing the limit\nU \u2192 \u221e and then D \u2192 \u221e in the \u03c64 model (4), one recovers the IsXY model for C = 0.\nIn this case, the variables \u03c3x and ~sx are related with those of the \u03c64 model by\n~ 1,x = 1 (1 + \u03c3x )~sx ,\n\u03c6\n2\n\n~ 2,x = 1 (1 \u2212 \u03c3x )~sx .\n\u03c6\n2\n\n(8)\n\nModels with C 6= 0 can also be recovered from a \u03c64 Hamiltonian. It is enough to add\nP\nan energy-energy nearest-neighbor hopping term hxyi (\u03c621,x \u03c621,y + \u03c622,x \u03c622,y ).\nApparently, the IsXY model is only invariant under the group O(2)\u2297Z2 . However,\nits relation with the \u03c64 model indicates that the symmetry is larger. Indeed, for any\nvalue of C, the model is invariant under the O(2)\u2295O(2) nonlinear transformations\n~sx\u2032 = [ 12 (1 + \u03c3x )R(1) + 21 (1 \u2212 \u03c3x )R(2) ]~sx ,\n\u03c3x\u2032 = \u03c3x ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere R(1) and R(2) are O(2) rotation matrices.\nIt is possible to argue that in the IsXY model chiral and spin modes cannot be\ncritical at the same value of J and C, see, e.g., Ref. [68]. Let us assume that, for fixed\nC, the model undergoes a continuous phase transition at J = Jch , where the chiral\ncorrelation length is infinite, i.e. where \u03c3 correlations are critical. Let us consider first\nthe dynamics of the spins ~sx for a fixed Ising {\u03c3x } configuration. Spins \u03c3 with the\nsame sign form geometrical clusters and spins ~sx belonging to different geometrical (not\nFortuin-Kasteleyn) clusters do not interact (either directly or indirectly) because of the\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n8\n\nprefactor (1 + \u03c3x \u03c3y ) in the hopping term of the spin variables. Thus, the behavior of\nthe spins ~sx is completely determined by their behavior on each single cluster. It is easy\nto convince oneself that J = Jch is the percolation threshold of the clusters. Indeed,\nif the clusters percolate at J \u2217 < Jch , for J = J \u2217 Ising spins would already be critical,\nsince in two dimensions percolation of the geometrical clusters implies Ising criticality.\nNow, at the percolation threshold we expect the clusters to have a fractal dimension\nthat is smaller than 2. This is true for the Ising transition [81, 82]; we assume here that\nit holds in general. Thus, fields ~sx interact as on a system with d < 2 and thus cannot\nbe critical. Therefore, at the chiral transition the spin correlation length must be finite,\nand, moreover, Jch < Jsp . As we shall see, the MC results that we shall present provide\nsupport to this argument.\n3. Definitions and notations\n3.1. The fully frustrated XY model\nIn the square-lattice FFXY model the ground state is only invariant under translations\nof two lattice spacings. Therefore, we divide the lattice into four sublattices, so that\nthe four sites of each plaquette belong to different sublattices. Then, we define the\nspin correlation function Gs (x) \u2261 h~s0 * ~sx i only for x = (2n, 2m), n, m integers, and its\nP iq*x\nes (q) =\nFourier transform as G\nGs (x) where the sum goes over x \u2261 (2n, 2m). The\nxe\ncorresponding susceptibility \u03c7s and second-moment correlation length \u03bes are given by\nX\n\u03c7s \u2261\nGs (x),\n(10)\nx=(2n,2m)\n\n\u03bes2 \u2261\n\nes (0) \u2212 G\ne s (q)\nG\n1\n,\nes (q)\n4 sin (qmin /2)\nG\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwhere q = (qmin , 0), and qmin \u2261 2\u03c0/(L/2). We shall consider two RG invariant ratios\nrelated to the continuous spin modes:\nRs \u2261\n\n\u03bes\n,\nL\n\nBs \u2261\n\nh(\u03bc2 )2 i\n,\nh\u03bc2 i2\n\nwhere ~\u03bc is the magnetization corresponding to one of the four sublattices, i.e.\n4 X\n~sx ,\n~\u03bc \u2261\nV\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nx=(2n,2m)\n\nV \u2261 L2 is the volume, and \u03bc2 \u2261 ~\u03bc * ~\u03bc. We also define the helicity modulus \u03a5. For this\npurpose we introduce a twisted term in the Hamiltonian. More precisely, we consider\nthe nearest-neighbor sites (x, y) with x1 = L, y1 = 1, and x2 = y2 , and replace the term\n~sx * ~sy in Hamiltonian (3) with\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(2)\n(2)\n(1)\n~sx * R\u03c6~sy = s(1)\ns(1)\ns(2)\nx\ny cos \u03c6 + sy sin \u03c6 + sx\ny cos \u03c6 \u2212 sx sin \u03c6 , (14)\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n9\n\nwhere R\u03c6 is a rotation of an angle \u03c6.

Monte Carlo simulations\nWe perfomed MC simulations of the FFXY model (1), of the \u03c64 model (4) for U = 1\nand D in the range 1/20 \u2264 D \u2264 99, and of the IsXY model for \u22128 \u2264 C \u2264 0.3. We\nconsidered L \u00d7 L square lattices with periodic boundary conditions, up to L = O(103).\nThe phase diagram and critical behavior is investigated by analyzing the FSS behavior\nof several quantities. The total CPU time used in this study was approximately 10 CPU\nyears of a single 64-bit Opteron 246 (2Ghz) processor.\nIn the MC simulations of the FFXY model, we used a local algorithm based\non a mixture of Metropolis and overrelaxed (microcanonical) updates, as suggested\nin Ref. [60]. In the case of the IsXY and \u03c64 model the updating algorithm was\nbased on mixtures of Metropolis, overrelaxed (microcanonical), and single-cluster [83]\nupdates. More details on the MC algorithms are reported in Appendix A. At the\nchiral transition, single-cluster updates have little influence on the autocorrelation times,\nwhile the overrelaxation updates are only able to speed up the simulation but do not\nchange the dynamic critical exponent. This is always approximately equal to 2, as\nit is expected in the case of a purely local dynamics. This means that very long\nsimulations are needed to obtain reliable statistics. For instance, in order to obtain\napproximately 2500 independent configurations for the FFXY model on a lattice with\nL = 1000, we used approximately 800 days of a single 64-bit Opteron 246 processor.\nAnalogously, the runs on the largest lattices for the IsXY model (C = 0, L = 360, 4000\nindependent configurations) and for the \u03c64 model (D = 1/2, L = 1200, 150 independent\nconfigurations) took approximately 100 days in both cases. A substantial reduction of\nthe critical slowing down is achieved at the spin transition and in the LT phase, because\nthe overrelaxed and the cluster algorithm are very effective in dealing with the spin\nmodes.\n5. The low-temperature phase\nIn the high-temperature (HT) phase, in which symmetry is not broken, the spin and\nchiral correlation functions Gs (x) and Gc (x) decay exponentially at large distances.\nIn the LT phase (J large) instead, the spin correlation function Gs (x) is expected to\ndecay with a power law, giving rise to quasi-long-range order. Indeed, according to the\nMermin-Wagner theorem [84], any magnetization breaking a continuous symmetry is\nforbidden in two dimensions. On the other hand, the discrete Z2 symmetry may be\nbroken with a nonvanishing chiral magnetization. In this section we study the main\nfeatures of the LT phase. We shall see that Z2 symmetry is broken and that O(2)\nquasi-long-range order is realized in the whole LT phase. The critical behavior of the\nspin variables is controlled by a line of Gaussian fixed points that are exactly those that\ncontrol the LT phase of the standard XY model.\nDirect evidence for the breaking of the Z2 chiral symmetry in the LT phase is\nprovided by the finite-size behavior of the chiral Binder parameter Bc .

MC simulations (see Table 2) show\nthis behavior in all models that we have considered.\nLet us discuss the \u03c64 model in more detail. We distinguish the fields \u03c6i,x from the\nP\nsize of the corresponding quantity Qi \u2261 x \u03c62i,x . For each configuration, we define the\nlarge (small) field \u03c6la,x (\u03c6sm,x ) to be the field \u03c6i,x that has the maximum (minimum)\n~ la,0 * \u03c6\n~ la,x i\nvalue of Qi . Then, we define the corresponding two-point functions Gla (x) = h\u03c6\n~ sm,0 * \u03c6\n~ sm,x i, the magnetic susceptibilities \u03c7la and \u03c7sm , and the secondand Gsm (x) = h\u03c6\nmoment correlation lengths \u03bela and \u03besm , defined according to Eq. (23). Our numerical\nresults show that, as L increases, small and large fields effectively decouple. Indeed, \u03c7sm\nconverges to a constant, while \u03c7la diverges as L2\u2212\u03b7 . Therefore, in the large-L limit, since\n\u03c7s = \u03c7la + \u03c7sm , we have \u03c7la /\u03c7s = 1 + O(L\u22122+\u03b7 ). Fig. 1 shows estimates of \u03c7s , \u03c7sm , and\n\u03c7la for U = 1, D = 1/2, and J = 1.48 in the LT phase [as we shall see, for D = 1/2 there\nare two very close transitions, an Ising transition at Jch = 1.4668(1) and a KT transition\nat Jsp = 1.4704(2)]. It is evident that the large field is critical for any J, unlike the\nsmall one. We also checked the behavior of the correlation lengths: while \u03bela diverges\nas L, the small component \u03besm remains finite. As a consequence \u03bela/\u03bes = 1 + O(L\u22122+\u03b7 ),\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n1000000\n100000\n\n13\n\n\u03c7s\n\u03c7la\n\u03c7sm\n\n10000\n1000\n100\n10\n100\n\n1000\n\nL\nFigure 1.

For this purpose, we show\nthat, in the large-L limit, the exponent \u03b7 (computed from \u03c7s \u223c L2\u2212\u03b7 ), Rs \u2261 \u03bes /L, and\n\u03a5 satisfy the same universal FSS relations as the corresponding quantities in the XY\nmodel. These relations, that are reported in Appendix B, are universal once the shape\nof the lattice and the boundary conditions are fixed: in our case we consider a L \u00d7 L\nsquare lattice with periodic boundary conditions.\nIn order to verify these relations, for each L we compute Rs , \u03a5, and an effective\nestimate of \u03b7. Since the susceptibility behaves as \u03c7s \u223c L2\u2212\u03b7 , we define\n\u03b7(L1 , L2 ) \u2261 2 \u2212 ln[\u03c7(L1 )/\u03c7(L2 )]/ln(L1 /L2 ).\n\n(34)\n\nIn the \u03c64 and IsXY models we use the results for \u03c7la , \u03bela /L, and \u03a5la because they have\nsmaller scaling corrections with respect to the analogous quantities \u03c7, \u03bes /L, and \u03a5.\nSome results are reported in Table 2. In most of the cases, as L increases, all quantities\napproach a constant within error bars, indicating that we have reached the infinitevolume limit within errors. When convergence is not clearly observed within errors, we\nextrapolate the data assuming the scaling corrections that are expected in the LT phase\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n15\n\nof the XY model: we perform an extrapolation of the form a + bL\u2212\u03b6 , with \u03b6 = 1/\u03b7 \u2212 4\nfor \u03a5 and \u03b6 = Min(2 \u2212 \u03b7, 1/\u03b7 \u2212 4) for \u03c7s and Rs , see Appendix B.\nInfinite-volume estimates of \u03b7 are reported in Table 3. Beside the values obtained\nfrom the magnetic susceptibility, we also report the estimates obtained from Rs and \u03a5\nusing the XY relations. In all cases the estimates are in good agreement. In Fig. 2\nwe plot \u03bes /L versus \u03b7 as obtained from the susceptibility, for several models in the LT\nphase. The results agree quite precisely with the curve obtained in the standard XY\nmodel, see Appendix B. Thus, we conclude that the LT phase of the FFXY, \u03c64 , and\nIsXY models is controlled by the same line of Gaussian fixed points that are relevant\nfor the XY model.\nIn the XY model the LT phase becomes unstable against dissociation of vortices\nwhen \u03b7 = 1/4, and [85] \u03bes /L = RKT = 0.750691..., \u03a5 = \u03a5KT = 0.636508.... At\nthese values, a KT transition occurs and the system becomes disordered. We expect\nthat a similar mechanism is realized in the models considered here, as long as the\nchiral Z2 symmetry is broken. With decreasing J, \u03b7 increases. If \u03b7 = 1/4 is reached,\nvortices disorder the system and thus we expect a phase transition. If the transition is\ncontinuous and the chiral Z2 magnetization does not vanish at the transition, then the\nphase transition is expected to be of KT type. An Ising or first-order transition should\nthen occur at a smaller value of J, where also chiral variables disorder. Otherwise, if\nthe Z2 magnetization vanishes, the transition should belong to a new universality class.\nNote that this possibility is excluded in the IsXY model by the argument reported in\nSec. 2. If a transition occurs for \u03b7 < 1/4, it cannot be a KT one. Thus, it must be of\nfirst order or a continuous transition belonging to a new universality class. In the latter\ncase, however, we expect a single transition, since a new type of transition can only be\ndue to the interaction of spin and chiral modes that become critical at the same value\nof J.\n6. Phase transitions in the fully frustrated XY model\nIn this section we investigate the phase diagram of the square-lattice FFXY model. We\nshow that there are two very close but separate transitions, a KT transition at J = Jsp\ninvolving the spin degrees of freedom and an Ising transition at Jch < Jsp associated\nwith the breaking of the chiral Z2 symmetry.\n6.1. Finite-size scaling at the chiral transition\nWe perform a FSS analysis using the method proposed in Ref. [86] and also discussed in\nRef. [87]. Instead of computing the various quantities at fixed Hamiltonian parameters,\nwe compute them at a fixed value of a chiral-this guarantees that we are observing the\nchiral transition-RG invariant quantity; in our specific case we choose Rc \u2261 \u03bec /L. This\nmeans that, given a MC sample generated at J = Jrun , we determine, using standard\nreweighting techniques, the value JRc such that Rc (J = JRc ) = Rc,fix .

The pseudocritical temperature JRc converges to Jch as\nL \u2192 \u221e. This method has the advantage that it does not require a precise knowledge\nof the critical value Jch (an estimate is only needed to fix Jrun that should be close to\nJch ). Moreover, for some observables the statistical errors at fixed Rc are smaller than\nthose at fixed J (close to Jch ). This is due to cross correlations and to a reduction of the\neffective autocorrelation times. The ratio E/EfixRc of the errors at JRc computed at fixed\nJ and at fixed Rc turns out to be roughly independent of L: E/EfixRc \u2248 1.6, 4.3, 1.9, 1.0\nrespectively for \u03c7c , Bc , dBc /dJ and \u03a5.\nThe value Rc,fix can be specified at will as long as it positive,\u00a7 though Rc,fix = R\u0304c (R\u0304c\nis the critical-point value) improves the convergence for L \u2192 \u221e [86, 87]. Since in the\ntwo-transition scenario the chiral transition is predicted to be in the Ising universality\nclass, we choose Rc,fix = RIs where RIs = 0.9050488292(4) is the universal value of \u03be/L\nat the critical point in the 2-d Ising universality class [88]. This choice does not bias our\nanalysis in favor of the Ising nature of the chiral transition. For any chosen value (as\nlong as it is positive) and whatever the universality class of the chiral transition is (it\nmay also coincide with the spin transition), JRc (L) converges to Jch for L \u2192 \u221e. Indeed,\nin the FSS limit Rc = fR [L1/\u03bd (J \u2212 Jch )], where \u03bd and fR (x) depend on the universality\nclass of the transition. Therefore, fixing Rc is equivalent to fixing X \u2261 L1/\u03bd [JRc (L)\u2212Jch ].\nCritical exponents determined by using FSS do not depend on the chosen value Rc,fix ,\nwhile other finite-size quantities do. For instance, the Binder cumulant satisfies the\n\u00a7 The method can be used with any RG invariant quantity. For instance, one could also use the Binder\nparameter.

By fixing Rc to the critical Ising value, we will be able to perform\nan additional consistency check. If the chiral transition belongs to the Ising universality\nclass, then X = 0 (apart from scaling corrections) and we should find that any RGinvariant quantity converges to its critical-point value in the Ising model.\nIf the transition is unique also spin variables should have a finite nontrivial limit:\nfor instance, Rs at fixed Rc should converge to a nonvanishing constant. On the other\nhand, if the chiral transition occurs in a region in which the spin variables are still\ndisordered, the spin correlation length should be finite and thus Rs at fixed Rc should\nconverge to zero as 1/L.\nWe performed simulations on quite large lattices, up to L = 1000.

The dotted lines\ncorrespond to a linear fit of the data for the largest available lattices.\n\nreported in Table 4. In Fig. 3 we show the spin correlation length \u03bes as a function of L.\nIt clearly converges to a constant as L \u2192 \u221e. We can thus estimate the infinite-volume\n(c)\n(c)\nspin correlation length \u03bes at the chiral transition: \u03bes = 118(1). Moreover, the helicity\nmodulus \u03a5 at the chiral transition appears to vanish in the large-L limit, see Table 4,\nconsistently with the fact that spin variables are disordered. These results definitely\nshow that spin modes are not critical at the chiral transition, and therefore that, for\nJ > Jch , there is a phase in which the chiral Z2 symmetry is broken while spins remain\nparamagnetic.\nIf spin and chiral modes decouple, the chiral transition should belong to the Ising\nuniversality class. The best evidence for that is provided by the finite-size behavior\nof the chiral Binder cumulant Bc . In the case of an Ising transition, the asymptotic\nbehavior of Bc is expected to be [88, 89, 90]\nBc = BIs + O(L\u2212\u03c9 ) + O(L\u22122+\u03b7 ),\n\n(35)\n\nwhere [88] BIs = 1.167923(5). The first correction is due to the leading irrelevant\noperator, the second one to the analytic background terms. Since for unitary Ising\nmodels [89, 90] \u03c9 = 2 and 2\u2212\u03b7 = 7/4, the dominant scaling corrections are those related\nto the analytic background. The estimates of Bc reported in Table 4 show a peculiar\n(c)\nintermediate nonmonotonic crossover: for L <\n\u223c \u03bes \u2248 118, Bc is approximately constant\nand equal to 1.19-1.20, while the asymptotic regime given by Eq.

A linear fit to a + bL\u22127/4 of the data with\nL \u2265 384 gives Bc = 1.1678(16). We also mention that a linear fit of \u2206Bc to bL\u22127/4 for\nL \u2265 384 gives b = 585(32) with \u03c72 /d.o.f. \u2248 0.2, where d.o.f. is the number of degrees\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n19\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n1/\u03bdeff\n0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\nfrom Rc\nfrom Bc\nfrom Rs\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nL\nFigure 5.

The results are shown in Fig. 5. The exponents 1/\u03bdeff (L)\nobtained from Rc and Bc show a similar behavior. They are nonmonotonic and, for\n20 <\n\u223c L <\n\u223c 70, they are approximately constant and equal to 1.3, which corresponds\nto \u03bdeff \u2248 0.8. This is consistent with the result \u03bd \u2248 0.8 obtained in previous studies\n(c)\nthat considered lattice sizes in this range [25, 26, 27, 36, 38]. For L >\n\u223c \u03bes = 118, the\neffective exponent 1/\u03bdeff (L) decreases rapidly, undershoots the Ising value \u03bd = 1, which\nis then approached from below. In Fig. 5 we also report 1/\u03bdeff (L) computed by using\nRs . For small values of L, we find \u03bdeff (L) \u2248 0.9-this explains why spin modes have\n(c)\nsometimes been thought to be critical at the Ising transition-while for L >\n\u223c \u03bes it starts\n(c)\nto decrease towards the asymptotic value \u22121, corresponding to a finite \u03bes at the chiral\ntransition. In Fig. 6 we show the effective chiral exponent \u03b7eff defined analogously to\n\u03bdeff in terms of \u03c7c , which should behave as L2\u2212\u03b7 . The exponent is first larger than the\nIsing value, then becomes smaller, and only for L >\n\u223c 500 appears to approach the Ising\nvalue \u03b7 = 1/4.\nThe critical value Jch of the hopping coupling at the chiral transition can be\ndetermined from the finite-size behavior of JRc . Assuming that the transition is of\nIsing type, the large-volume behavior of JRc is given by\nJRc = Jch + O(L\u22121/\u03bd\u2212\u03c9 ) + O(L\u22121/\u03bd\u22122+\u03b7 ),\n\n(38)\n\nwhere the first correction is due to the leading irrelevant operators, while the second\ncorrection is due to the analytic background [89, 90]. Note that in Eq. (38) we use the\nfact that the fixed value Rc,fix is the critical Ising value RIs . If Rc,fix 6= RIs , the leading\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\nTable 5.

According to Eq. (38), since \u03c9 = 2 and \u03b7 = 1/4,\nthe leading corrections to the infinite-volume limit are of order L\u221211/4 . In Fig. 7 we plot\nJRc versus L\u221211/4 . In analogy with what is observed for the other chiral quantities, the\n(c)\nasymptotic behavior sets in only for L \u226b \u03bes . A linear fit of the data with L \u2265 384\ngives Jch = 2.20632(5). This estimate is significantly more precise than earlier results:\nJch = 2.2051(24) (Ref. [71]), Jch = 2.2002(10) (Ref. [63]), Jch = 2.212(5) (Ref. [40]), and\nJch = 2.203(10) (Ref. [38]).\nIn conclusion, a careful FSS analysis on lattice sizes up to L = 1000 is consistent\nwith an asymptotic critical behavior belonging to the Ising universality class, as expected\nwithin the two-transition scenario. However, before observing the asymptotic Ising\nbehavior, we find a peculiar nonmonotonic crossover behavior. This is related to the\n(c)\n(c)\nfact that the spin correlation length \u03bes is large at the chiral transition. For L <\n\u223c \u03bes\nspin modes appear as being critical, as also indicated by the effective exponent \u03bdeff that\n(c)\nis obtained from dRs /dJ, which, for L <\n\u223c \u03bes , behaves as the exponent obtained from\nchiral observables, see Fig. 5. We will further discuss these crossover behaviors in Sec. 9.\n6.2. The spin transition\nSince spins are paramagnetic at the chiral transition, the quasi-long-range order that\ncharacterizes the LT phase requires a spin transition at a larger value of J. Since the LT\nphase is controlled by the same line of fixed points that are relevant for the XY model,\nand chiral modes do not play any role at the transition, it is natural to conjecture that\nit belongs to the KT universality class.\nIn order to determine the critical hopping parameter Jsp of the spin transition, we\nexploit the predicted asymptotic behavior of the helicity modulus \u03a5 and of the ratio\nR \u2261 \u03be/L at the KT transition. On a square lattice L \u00d7 L at the critical temperature\nwe have for L \u2192 \u221e [85]\n0.318899454...\n+ ...,\n(39)\n\u03a5 = 0.63650817819... +\nln L + C\u03a5\n0.212430...\n+ ...,\n(40)\nR = 0.7506912... +\nln L + CR\nwhere CR and C\u03a5 are nonuniversal constants and the neglected corrections are of order\nln ln L/ ln2 L.\nThe critical point Jsp is obtained by determining the value of J where the behavior\nof \u03a5 and Rs is given by Eqs. (39) and (40). In practice, we first obtain an approximate\nestimate of Jsp by looking for the value of J at which \u03a5 and Rs are both close to the\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n22\n\nISING\n\n1/J\n\n?\nKT\nFIRST ORDER\n\nD\nFigure 8.

Then, we perform simulations at two values of J, J1 and J2 ,\nthat are close to the estimated Jsp , and determine \u03a5 and Rs for J1 < J < J2 by linear\ninterpolation. Finally, for each pair of sizes L1 and L2 , we require \u03a5 and Rs at J = Jsp\nto be exactly given by the previous expressions. In this way we obtain two nonlinear\nequations for two free parameters: the critical value Jsp and the constant C. Table 5\nshows the results for several pairs of lattices with L2 /L1 = 2. In spite of the expected\nslow convergence, the results obtained from Rs and \u03a5 are consistent. This provides a\nnontrivial check of the KT nature of the transition. The helicity modulus \u03a5 shows the\nleast L dependence and provides our final estimate: Jsp = 2.2415(5). Previous estimates\nof Jsp are: Jsp = 2.227(5) (Ref. [71]), Jsp = 2.2422(5) (Ref.

On the other hand, for sufficiently small D, we provide evidence of two\nvery close transitions, a KT transition at J = Jsp associated with the breaking of the\ncontinuous degrees of freedom and an Ising transition at Jch < Jsp associated with the\nbreaking of the interchange (chiral) Z2 symmetry.

We do not know how the two continuous transition lines connect\nto the unique first-order one. There are several possibilities. Under the hypothesis that\nno unique continuous transition occurs, as expected in the IsXY model (see Sec. 2), we\nmay have: (i) the Ising line becomes of first order at D = Dch < D \u2217 , and then the KT\nline meets the first-order line at D \u2217 (this possibility is presented in Fig. 8); (ii) as before,\nbut interchanging Ising and KT lines; (iii) both the Ising and KT lines become of first\norder at D = Dch and D = Dsp respectively, with Dch , Dsp < D \u2217 , and then they meet at\nD = D \u2217 . Our data suggest that the intermediate region between the one characterized\nby two continuous transitions and the one with a unique first-order transition should\nbe relatively small, i.e. Dch , Dsp , D \u2217 are close to 49 and larger than 34. However,\nwe cannot exclude that the system undergoes a unique continuous transition at some\nvalue of D or in some interval of D in this intermediate region. In this case two further\npossibilities may be realized: the Ising and KT line meet and then, a single transition\nline starts, which can be either of first order or of second order (turning eventually to\nfirst order).\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n24\n\nTable 6.

First-order transition for large D\nFor sufficiently large values of D there is a unique first-order transition from the\ndisordered phase to the LT phase. Evidence for a first-order transition is provided\nby the presence of two peaks in the distribution P (E) of the hopping-energy density\nE defined in Eq. (20). We determine the position of the transition by using the equalweight method for the two phases applied to the energy density. In practice, for each\nlattice size we compute Emin , the energy corresponding to the minimum between the\npeaks of the histogram. Then, a given configuration is considered as a LT configuration\nif E > Emin , a HT configuration otherwise. Finally, for each lattice size we determine a\npseudo-critical value Jpc (L) by requiring that for J = Jpc (L) the ratio of the probabilities\nof LT and HT configurations is some fixed number w. In our case the value w = 2 seems\nthe most appropriate one, since the LT phase is expected to be twofold degenerate. Note\nthat Jpc (L) converges to the infinite-volume transition value Jc for any chosen value w,\nwith corrections that are generically of order 1/V . The position of the transition point\ncan also be identified by considering the value Jmax (L) where the specific heat C takes\nits maximum value. Also Jmax (L) is expected to converge to Jc with corrections of order\n1/V .\nTo identify the first-order transition region, we have performed simulations for\nD = 34, 49, and 99. The distributions of the hopping energy and of the chiral\nmagnetization for D = 99 shown in Fig. 9 clearly indicate that the transition is of first\norder. They have a deep minimum between the two peaks which decreases exponentially\nas L \u2192 \u221e, consistently with a first-order transition. For instance, the minimum of the\nenergy distribution, P (Emin), is expected to behave as e\u22122\u03c3L , where \u03c3 is the interface\ntension. Fitting the estimates of P (Emin) reported in Table 6 to ce\u22122\u03c3L , where \u03c3 is\nthe interface tension, we obtain the estimate \u03c3 = 0.017(2), which is rather small. The\ncritical value Jc can be estimated by fitting the results for Jpc and Jmax reported in\nTable 6 to Jc + a/V . We obtain Jc = 1.60042(5) from Jpc and Jc = 1.60040(6) from\nJmax . Finally, from the maximum value of C one can also estimate the latent heat\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n25\n\n3\n\n2\n\nL=48\nL=64\nL=96\nL=128\n\n1\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nL=48\nL=64\nL=96\nL=128\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\nFigure 10.

Using \u22062 = 4Cmax /V + O(1/V ), we obtain \u2206 \u2248 1.4.\nThe analysis of the chiral and spin degrees of freedom does not provide evidence of\nother transitions. On the LT side of the first-order transition, i.e. for J \u2192 Jc \u2248 1.6004\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n26\n\nfrom above, the data for D = 99 reported in Table 3 give \u03b7 \u2248 0.12, which is much below\nthe value \u03b7 = 1/4 where vortex dissociation destabilizes the LT XY phase. In Table 3\nwe also report a result for J = 1.6003. This value of J is on the HT side. On the\nother hand, the MC run started from a LT configuration and no drastic change of the\nthermodynamic variables was observed during the run. Thus, the result corresponds to\nan average taken in the metastable phase. Finally, we mention that also the finite-size\nbehavior of the derivative of the chiral Binder parameter with respect to J at Jpc is\nconsistent with the behavior expected at a first-order transition [91]. Indeed, we find\ndBc (L)/dJ \u223c L1/\u03bdeff with 1/\u03bdeff = 2.0(1), in agreement with 1/\u03bdeff = d = 2, which is\nvalid in the FSS limit at a first-order transition.\nWith decreasing D, the first-order transition becomes weaker and weaker and\neventually disappears. The results for D = 49 reported in Table 6 and the distributions\nshown in Fig. 10 suggest that this occurs for D \u2248 49. Although two peaks are still\npresent, P (Emin) is roughly constant with L and does not show the exponential decrease\nexpected at a first-order transition. This is the typical behavior of energy distributions\nclose to a tricritical point where the first-order transition line ends; see, e.g., Ref. [92]. An\nanalogous behavior is observed in the distributions of the chiral magnetization shown in\nFig. 10. It is interesting to observe that two peaks in the energy and chiral-magnetization\ndistributions are also observed for smaller values of D on lattice sizes of order L \u223c 102 .\nHowever, in this case the minimum value of the energy distribution increases. This is\nclearly observed for D = 34, see Fig. 11. For D = 49 the analysis of the finite-size\nbehavior of the derivative of the chiral Binder parameter gives 1/\u03bd = 1.84(16). This\nestimate suggests a value smaller than 2, the value expected at a first-order transition,\nand it is consistent with the corresponding value at the tricritical Ising point, which is\n1/\u03bd = 9/5 [95]. We do not find evidence of other transitions for D = 49.\n7.2. Continuous transitions\n7.2.1. Standard finite-size scaling analysis. Let us first discuss the results for D = 1/2.\nIn Fig. 12 we plot Rs \u2261 \u03bes /L and Rc \u2261 \u03bec /L versus J for L \u2264 500 in the critical\nregion. The crossing points correspond to different, though very close values of J:\nJcross \u2248 1.4688 for Rs and Jcross \u2248 1.4668 for Rc . Apparently, chiral and spin variables\nhave different crossing points, as also confirmed by the analysis of the Binder parameters:\nJcross \u2248 1.4680 for Bs\u03c6 , and Jcross \u2248 1.4668 for Bc . This difference may be due to scaling\ncorrections or to the presence of two different transitions. In order to investigate this\nissue we perform a scaling analysis. We fit the data for R = Rs , Bs\u03c6 , Rc , and Bc with\nR(L, J) = f [(J \u2212 Jc )L1/\u03bd ],\n\n(42)\n\nwhere f (x) is approximated by a polynomial. Fits of the chiral variables Rc and Bc for\nL \u2265 200 give \u03bd = 0.78(2) and \u03bd = 0.80(3) with a reasonable, though not good, \u03c72 , i.e.\n\u03c72 /d.o.f. \u2248 2. The analysis of the spin variables is much less stable. We obtain \u03bd = 0.91.2 from Bs\u03c6 and \u03bd \u2248 1.5 for Rs . These results suggest that spin and chiral variables\nundergo two different, though close transitions.

Moreover, the numerical\nresults apparently exclude that the chiral transition is in the Ising universality class.\nIndeed, the exponent \u03bd appears to be different from the Ising one \u03bdIs = 1 and, at the\ncrossing point, Rc and Bc take the values R\u0304c = 1.15(3) and B\u0304c = 1.116(5), that differ\nfrom the Ising values [88] RIs = 0.9050488292(4), BIs = 1.167923(5).\nSimilar results are also obtained for other values of D. For example, the same FSS\nanalysis of the data at D = 1/3 up to L = 600 gives Jcross \u2248 1.4768 (chiral observables),\n\u03bd = 0.79(1) (from Rc ), \u03bd = 0.80(1) (from Bc ), and R\u0304c = 1.11(2) and B\u0304c = 1.116(5); Rs\nand Bs\u03c6 have crossing points at J \u2248 1.4791 and J \u2248 1.4785, with exponent \u03bd = 0.9-1.2.\nFor D = 1, Rc and Bc have a crossing point at J \u2248 1.4610, with exponents \u03bd = 0.78(2)\nand \u03bd = 0.80(2) respectively, and R\u0304c = 1.17(3) and B\u0304c = 1.132(8); Rs and Bs\u03c6 have\ncrossing points at J \u2248 1.4632 and J \u2248 1.4625, with exponents \u03bd = 1.2-1.4.\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\nL\n8\n12\n16\n24\n32\n48\n60\n64\n90\n120\n128\n150\n180\n200\n256\n300\n360\n400\n500\n512\n600\n800\n1200\n\n28\n\nTable 7.

The first one is associated with the chiral degrees of freedom with an\nexponent \u03bd \u2248 0.8. This is similar to what has been observed in the past in similar\nsystems, see Table 1. In the next Section, we shall show that the result \u03bd \u2248 0.8 is a\ncrossover effect: The chiral transition belongs to the Ising universality class.\n7.2.2. Finite-size scaling at fixed Rc . In order to check whether the appearence of two\nvery close transitions is just due to uncontrolled systematic errors, or the value \u03bd \u2248 0.8\nof the chiral exponent is an effective exponent associated with a preasymptotic regime,\nwe performed additional simulations on larger lattices. We follow here the same strategy\nused in Sec. 6.1 for the FFXY model, i.e. we perform a FSS analysis at fixed Rc = RIs .\nIn Table 7 we report the data for D = 1/2 up to L = 1200. The results for Rs and\n\u03a5 at fixed Rc , which are also plotted in Fig. 3 and 13 respectively, strongly favor the\ntwo-transition picture: Rs and \u03a5 are clearly decreasing and do not show any evidence\n(c)\nof convergence to a nonzero value. Note that the spin correlation length \u03bes at the\n(c)\nchiral transition is rather large. The results for the largest lattices suggest \u03bes >\n\u223c 360,\n(c)\nexplaining the strong crossover effects. The large correlation length \u03bes also suggests\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n29\n\n1.00\n\n\u03a5\n0.10\n\n0.01\n\nFFXY\nD=1/20\nD=1/10\nD=1/5\nD=1/2\nD=2\nD=4\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nL\nFigure 13.

The dotted lines connecting\ndifferent sets of data are drawn to guide the eye. Note that the data for D = 2 overlap\nwith those for the FFXY model.\n\nthat the spin transition should occur at values of J that are very close to Jch . This will\nbe confirmed in Sec. 7.2.4.\nSimilar results are obtained for other values of D, D = 1/20, 1/10, 1/5, 1/3, 1, 2, 4,\nperforming the same FSS analysis for lattices with L \u2264 600. In Fig. 13 we show\nthe helicity modulus \u03a5 for several values of D. In all cases \u03a5 appears to decrease,\nconsistently with the fact that it should eventually vanish in the large-L limit.\n7.2.3. Ising critical behavior at the chiral transition. We now analyze the critical\nbehavior at the chiral transition. In particular, we wish to understand whether the\nresults of the FSS analysis of Sec. 7.2.1, indicating a critical behavior different from the\nIsing one, are confirmed by a FSS analysis that includes larger lattices. As in Sec. 6.1,\nwe consider the chiral effective exponents 1/\u03bdeff obtained from Rc and Bc . The results\nfor D = 1/2 are shown in Fig. 14. The curves for 1/\u03bdeff (L) show first an extended\nregion, corresponding approximately to 50 <\n\u223cL<\n\u223c 300, in which \u03bdeff \u2248 0.8. Then, the\nFSS curves decrease rapidly towards values which are substantially consistent with the\nIsing exponent \u03bd = 1. In Fig. 15 we show the results for the effective chiral exponent\n\u03b7eff defined by using \u03c7c \u223c L2\u2212\u03b7 , in analogy with the definition of \u03bdeff . The exponent\napproaches the Ising value \u03b7 = 1/4 as L increases. Analogous crossovers are observed\nin other quantities, in the Binder cumulant Bc , see Fig. 4, and in the pseudocritical JRc .\nThe Ising regime, in which Bc \u2248 BIs + cL\u22127/4 and JRc = Jch + aL\u221211/4 , cf. Eqs. (35)\nand (38), is observed only when L >\n\u223c 600. From linear fits of the data for the largest\navailable lattice sizes, we obtain the estimate Jch = 1.4668(1).\nIn Figs. 16 and 17 we show the chiral Binder cumulant and the effective exponents\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n30\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1/\u03bdeff\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n0\n\nfrom Rc\nfrom Bc\nfrom Rs\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nL\nFigure 14.

For 0 < D <\n\u223c 2 the behavior\nis similar to that observed for D = 1/2 and in the FFXY model. In particular, also\nhere Bc and the exponent \u03bdeff are respectively approximately equal to 1.19-1.20 and\n0.8 in a quite large range of values of L. For these values of D we do not observe the\n(c)\napproach to the Ising value. This is not surprising since, as we shall show in Sec. 9, \u03bes\n(c)\nincreases as D \u2192 0 and thus our data do not satisfy the condition L \u226b \u03bes . For D >\n\u223c2\nthe approach appears qualitatively different and, in particular, no plateau at \u03bd \u2248 0.8\nappears.

Also in this case the chiral transition should\nbelong to the Ising universality class, as expected within the two-transition scenario.\nWe expect that, as in the FFXY model, Ising behavior can be clearly observed only\n(c)\n(c)\nwhen L \u226b \u03bes . Since, \u03bes >\n\u223c 360 in this case, much larger lattices would be needed to\nobtain a result as reliable as that of the FFXY model. Similar results are obtained for\nother values of D.

We will discuss again\nthis issue in Sec. 9.\n7.2.4. The spin transition. In order to determine the critical hopping parameter Jsp of\nthe spin transition for D = 1/2, we use the same method applied to the FFXY model\nin Sec. 6.2. We assume that the transition belongs to the KT universality class and\nexploit the predicted asymptotic behavior of \u03a5 and Rs \u2261 \u03bes /L at the KT transition, cf.\nEqs. (39) and (40).

We also mention that the chiral second-moment\n(s)\ncorrelation length \u03bec [which can be obtained from the chiral connected correlation\n(s)\nfunction (26)] is \u03bec = 22(3) at the KT transition. As expected, the Ising and KT\ntransitions are very close, indeed \u03b4 \u2261 Jsp /Jch \u2212 1 = 0.0025(2).\nFor other values of D we do not have enough data to perform the previous analysis.\nNonetheless, we are still able to obtain a lower bound for Jsp . We assume only that, in the\nlimit L \u2192 \u221e, Rs = 0.7506912... and \u03a5 = 0.63650817819... for J = Jsp , and that R and\n\u03a5 decrease with L, as suggested by Eqs. (40) and (39) and confirmed by our data. Then,\nfor each L, we determine, using the results for \u03bes /L and \u03a5, the value J for which Rs and\n\u03a5 are equal to the theoretical infinite-volume predictions. These results provide lower\nbounds on the correct critical Jsp . If we apply this procedure to the data with D = 1/2\nand L = 1024 we obtain Jsp,low = 1.46971(2) from \u03bes /L, and Jsp,low = 1.46957(2) from\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n33\n\n0.68\n\n1/Jch\n0.66\n\n0.64\n\n0.62\n0.01\n\n0.10\n\n1.00\n\n10.00\n\n100.00\n\nD\nFigure 18.

The phase diagram for small values of D\nOur numerical simulations provide evidence of two transitions for D = 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, 4.\nIn addition, relatively short MC simulations at D = 1/20, 1/10, 1/5, and 34 appear\nconsistent with the two-transition scenario, although the evidence is less robust since\nour simulations used smaller lattice sizes. A natural conjecture is that the two-transition\n\u2217\n\u2217\nscenario extends from D <\n\u223c D , 34 < D <\n\u223c 49, down to D \u2192 0. For D = 0 Hamiltonian\nH\u03c6 is O(4) symmetric. According to the Mermin-Wagner theorem [84], it does not\nhave any transition at finite temperature, and criticality is observed only for J \u2192 \u221e.\nTherefore, the Ising and KT transition lines should meet at D = 0, 1/J = 0, which is a\nmulticritical point.\nAt a generic multicritical point with two even relevant parameters, such as the\nreduced temperature t \u2261 T /Tmc \u2212 1 and a generic scaling field g (where T = Tmc and\ng = 0 is the position of the multicritical point), the singular part of the free energy is\ngiven by [96, 95]\nFsing \u223c t2\u2212\u03b1 B(X),\n\nX = gt\u2212\u03c6 ,\n\n(43)\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n34\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03c6 are the specific-heat and crossover exponents. This expression is not very\nuseful in our case, since Tmc \u2261 1/Jmc = 0 and \u03be \u223c ecJ . However, it is easy to rewrite\nEq. (43) in a different form that can be easily generalized. If \u03be(t, g = 0) is the correlation\nlength for g = 0, and \u03bd is the corresponding critical exponent so that \u03be(t, g = 0) \u223c t\u2212\u03bd ,\nwe can write\nFsing \u223c \u03be(t, g = 0)d A(Y ),\n\nY = g\u03be(t, g = 0)\u03c1 ,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere \u03c1 \u2261 \u03c6/\u03bd. In this expression there is no explicit t dependence and thus we can use\nit for D \u2192 0.\nIn the theory described by H\u03c6 , g is essentially the parameter D. The crossover\nP\nexponent \u03c1 is related to the RG dimension of the perturbation x \u03c621,x \u03c622,x at the O(4)\nfixed point. In two dimensions, \u03c1 is equal to the engineering dimension of the operator,\nso that \u03c1 = 2, with logarithmic corrections. The perturbative analysis is analogous to\nthat presented in Ref. [93], in which the effect of a spin-n perturbation in the 3-vector\nmodel is discussed. The correct scaling variable is Y \u2261 D\u03be 2 (ln \u03be)\u22126 , or, using the fact\nthat \u03be \u223c J \u22121/2 ecJ ,\n\u0176 \u2261 D(cJ)\u22127 exp(2cJ).\n\n(45)\n\nThe power appearing in the logarithm, which is universal, has been determined by\nusing the perturbative results of Ref. [94], which gives the anomalous dimension of any\ndimension-zero spin-n perturbation of the N-vector model. In the limit U \u2192 \u221e, in\nwhich the \u03c64 model reduces to the 4-vector model with a spin-4 perturbation, we also\nhave c = \u03c0.\nA standard scaling assumption in multicritical theories [96, 95] is that, along the\ncritical lines meeting at the multicritical point, the scaling variables Y and \u0176 are\nasymptotically constant. This implies that the Ising and KT critical lines, corresponding\nto J = Jch (D) and J = Jsp (D), approach the O(4) multicritical point according to\nD(cJch,sp )\u22127 exp(2cJch,sp ) = \u0176ch,sp ,\nwhere \u0176ch and \u0176sp are two different constants, with \u0176sp > \u0176ch . It follows\n\u0014\n\u0015\n7\n1\n1\nln(\u0176ch,sp /D) ,\ncJch,sp \u2248 ln(\u0176ch,sp /D) + ln\n2\n2\n2\n\n(46)\n\n(47)\n\nand\n\n\u03b4\u2261\n\nJsp\nln(\u0176sp/\u0176ch )\n\u22121\u223c\n.\nJch\nln \u0176ch /D\n\n(48)\n\nWe finally mention that for D < 0 we expect only one KT transition line starting from\n1/J = 0, D = 0, where both fields \u03c6i,x become critical simultaneously. The same RG\narguments used above tell us that Jsp,D<0 \u223c ln(1/|D|).\nUnfortunately, we are not able to check numerically these predictions. Indeed, this\nrequires to work in a regime in which Jch and Jsp are large and this happens only for\nvery tiny values of D. But for very small values of D very large lattices are needed in\norder to observe the asymptotic behavior. For D <\n\u223c 1, the values of Jch increase with\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\nKT\n\nC\n\n35\n\nJ\n\nISING\n\naf\n\n?\n\n?\n\nFIRST ORDER\nFigure 19. Sketch of the phase diagram of the Ising-XY model. The continuous,\ndashed, and thick continuous lines represent Ising, KT, and first-order transition lines.\nThe distance between the Ising and KT lines is amplified to distinguish them. The\nphase diagram within the two circled regions is unknown.\n\ndecreasing D, see Fig. 18, but D \u2248 0.1 seems still far from the asymptotic regime in\nwhich Eq. (47) holds. Note that the presence of the O(4) point influences the values of\n\u03bdeff for the lowest values of D. Indeed, see Fig. 17, \u03bdeff is larger than one for small values\nof L. This is due to the influence of the O(4) multicritical point, for which 1/\u03bd = 0.\nFinally, we would like to point out that an O(4) zero-temperature multicritical\nbehavior is also expected in the antiferromagnetic XXZ model on a triangular lattice.\nIts Hamiltonian is\nX\nHXXZ = J\ns1x s1y + s2x s2y + As3x s3y ,\n(49)\nhxyi\n\nwhere ~sx is a three-component vector satisfying ~sx * ~sx = 1. In the easy-axis regime\nA < 1, the ground-state structure is analogous to that of the FFXY model [97, 58],\nand therefore two close Ising and KT transitions are expected. For A = 1 one recovers\nthe isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model, which is not expected to present any\nfinite-temperature transition, but it should become critical only for J \u2192 \u221e, see, e.g.,\nRefs. [98, 99]. Due to the effective enlargement of the symmetry from O(3)\u2297O(2) to\nO(4) [100], the asymptotic behavior for J \u2192 \u221e is expected to be the same as that of\nthe O(4) vector model.\n8. Phase transitions in the Ising-XY model\nIn this section we discuss the critical behavior of the IsXY model (7). Some features\nof its phase diagram can be easily determined, see Fig. 19. At J = 0 we have an Ising\n\u221a\ntransition at C = CIs = 12 log(1 + 2) = 0.4406868 . . .. An Ising transition line in the\nJ-C plane starts from this point. For C = \u221e there is a KT transition at [101, 85]\nJ \u2248 1.1199, from which a KT line starts. As we shall see, with decreasing C < CIs the\nKT and Ising transition lines get closer and closer. Another Ising transition occurs at\nJ = 0 and C = \u2212CIs , from which an Ising transition line should start and lie in the\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\nL\n6\n8\n12\n16\n24\n32\n48\n64\n90\n128\n180\n256\n360\n\nJR c\n1.4339(7)\n1.4415(4)\n1.4498(3)\n1.4538(2)\n1.4589(2)\n1.46165(7)\n1.46445(4)\n1.46586(4)\n1.46707(3)\n1.46782(3)\n1.46823(3)\n1.46834(3)\n1.46838(3)\n\nTable 10.

We have not investigated the\nbehavior of the IsXY model along this antiferromagnetic transition line, although it is\nlikely (but we have not numerically checked) that the second-order transition line turns\ninto a first-order one as J increases, as it happens for the ferromagnetic case that we\nare going to discuss below.\nThe phase diagram of the IsXY model was already studied in Refs. [26, 29, 42].\nThey found an Ising and a KT transition for CIs > C >\n\u223c 0.1 and a single first-order\n<\ntransition for C \u223c \u22124. These works also claimed the existence of unique continuous\ntransitions belonging to new universality classes for \u22124 <\n\u223c C <\n\u223c 0.1. Along this line\ncritical exponents were found to depend on C. As we shall see, our results do not\nsupport the existence of a unique continuous transition in which spin and chiral modes\nbecome critical at the same J. We find two close KT and Ising continuous transitions\nfor C <\n\u223c \u22125, and a single first-order transition beyond, in agreement with the argument\nreported in Sec. 2, which forbids a continuous transition where chiral and spin modes\nbecome critical.\nWe perform the same FSS analysis as described in Sec. 6.1. We first discuss in\nsome detail the results for C = 0. In Table 10 we report data for C = 0 up to L = 360,\nwhich turn out to be sufficient to infer the asymptotic critical behavior. As also shown\n(c)\nin Fig. 3, the spin correlation length \u03bes at the chiral transition clearly converges to a\n(c)\nfinite value: we find \u03bes = 52.7(4). Correspondingly, the helicity modulus vanishes in\nthe large-L limit. Again, the best evidence of an asymptotic Ising critical behavior is\nobtained from the analysis of the chiral Binder cumulant Bc . Fig. 4 shows the difference\n\u2206Bc \u2261 Bc \u2212 BIs that clearly converges to the Ising value as L increases. A linear fit to\na+bL\u22127/4 of the data for the three largest lattices gives Bc = 1.1679(18), to be compared\nwith [88] BIs = 1.167923(5). A linear fit to bL\u22127/4 of \u2206Bc for the three largest lattices\ngives b = 146(6) with \u03c72 /d.o.f \u2248 0.1. The critical coupling JRc shows the expected rate\nof convergence.

The effective exponents \u03bdeff obtained from the derivative of Rc , Bc , Rs ,\nsee Fig. 20, and the exponent \u03b7eff obtained from \u03c7c behave as observed in the FFXY\nmodel and in the \u03c64 model in the region 0 < D <\n\u223c 2, see also Sec. 9. The values of 1/\u03bdeff\nobtained from Rc and Bc are first larger than the Ising value, then become significantly\nsmaller, and eventually converge to 1 from below.\nEstimates of the critical value of J at the KT transition have been obtained following\nthe procedure described in Sec. 6.2, using the estimate of Rs and \u03a5 with L \u2264 512. We\n(s)\nobtain Jsp = 1.493(1), see also Table 8. The chiral correlation length \u03bec at the KT\n(s)\ntransition is \u03bec = 4.3(5). Again, the relative difference \u03b4 \u2261 Jsp /Jch \u2212 1 of the critical\ncouplings is very small, i.e. \u03b4 = 0.0167(7).\nThe results for the other values of C are similar. For example, in Figs. 21, 22, and\n23 we show the helicity modulus \u03a5, the chiral Binder parameter Bc , and the effective\nexponent 1/\u03bdeff for several values of C. Precise estimates of the spin correlation length\n(c)\nat the chiral transition are obtained for C = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3: \u03bes = 26.6(2), 10.8(1), 3.70(2),\n(c)\nrespectively. As expected \u03bes rapidly decreases with increasing C, indicating that the\ndifference between the Ising and KT critical temperature becomes larger and larger up\nto C = CIs . We also performed simulations for negative values of C, C = \u22120.2, \u22120.5\nfor lattice sizes up to L = 256, C = \u22121, \u22122 to L = 128, and C = \u22123 to L = 192. The\nestimates of Rs and \u03a5 appear to decrease as in the C = 0 case, suggesting that the spin\nmodes are not critical at the chiral transition, thus favoring the two-transition picture.\n(c)\nWith decreasing C, \u03bes apparently increases, but we have not been able to directly\n(c)\nobserve that \u03bes is finite on the lattice sizes that we considered. However, our results\nare not consistent with a unique transition. As we shall see in the next section, the\nresults for C \u2265 \u22121 can be explained in terms of an approximately universal crossover\nwithin the standard two-transition picture.

For instance, the\nanalysis of the derivatives of Rc , Bc , Rs with respect to J for C = \u22122 up to L = 128\ngives 1/\u03bd \u2248 1.31, 1.40, 1.10. Each estimate appears quite stable with respect to L and\nthus it could be taken as evidence that the asymptotic limit has been reached and that\nthe critical chiral behavior is not Ising but belongs to a new universality class. This\ninterpretation is however not possible, since, if the transition is unique, the estimate of\n\u03bd should be independent of the observable. Analogously, for C = \u22123 up to L = 192 we\nobtain 1/\u03bd \u2248 1.42, 1.57, 1.23 from Rc , Bc , Rs , which are again not consistent with the\nexistence of a new universality class.

As\nalready discussed in Sec. 2, at the chiral transition spins ~s effectively live on geometrical\n(c)\nIsing clusters. If L \u226a \u03bes , XY spins are strongly correlated and thus we can use the\nspin-wave approximation, which leads to the prediction\n\u03a5 \u221d L\u2212\u01eb\n\n(50)\n\nwhere \u01eb = 2\u2212dgc > 0 and dgc is the effective fractal dimension of the geometrical clusters\nin this range of lattice sizes. In the case chiral and spin modes are effectively decoupled,\nand therefore the properties of the geometrical clusters are not affected by the spin\nmodes, one expects dgc to be equal to the fractal dimension of the geometrical Ising\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n40\n\nclusters which is predicted to be dIgc = 187/96 = 1.9479... [81, 82], corresponding to\n(c)\n\u01eb = 5/96 = 0.0521.... For L <\n\u223c \u03bes the data shown in Fig. 21 show a power-law behavior\nas in Eq. (50), but with a rather different exponent. For example, we find \u01eb \u2248 0.35 for\n0.2 >\n\u223cC >\n\u223c \u22121. This is due to the interaction between chiral and spin modes, which\n(c)\nchanges the effective fractal dimension of the geometrical clusters when L <\n\u223c \u03bes . Note\nthat the power-law decay of the helicity modulus is another piece of evidence in favor\nof the argument presented in Sec. 2, which excludes a unique second-order transitions\nfor any C, and therefore also for C = \u22122, \u22123.\nFor larger values of \u2212C, first-order transitions separate the LT from the disordered\nphase. Our simulations indicate the presence of a unique first-order transition for\nC<\n\u223c \u22125. In particular, we obtain the estimates \u03c3 \u2248 0.012, 0.006 for the interface tension\nat C = \u22128, \u22127, respectively. Moreover, for C \u2264 \u22127, the absence of a continuous KT\ntransition is rather clear from the analyses of the spin variables. On the LT side of the\ntransition, which is at Jc = 15.4255(5) for C = \u22127, we definitely find \u03b7 < 1/4: \u03b7 \u2248 0.035\nat J = 15.426, and \u03b7 \u2248 0.043 at J = 15.425 in the metastable LT phase. The presence of\nfirst-order transitions for C <\n\u223c \u22125 may also explain the results for the effective exponent\n1/\u03bdeff at C = \u22122, \u22123. The apparent increase of 1/\u03bdeff as |C| increases on small lattices\ncan be interpreted as due to the presence of a nearby first-order transition.\nIn conclusion, the phase diagram of the IsXY model is characterized by an Ising\n\u2217\nand a KT transition for CIs > C >\n\u223c \u22125, and by a unique first-order transition for C < C\n\u2217\nwith \u22125 >\n\u223cC >\n\u223c \u22127. A sketch of the phase diagram is shown in Fig. 19. Again we do\nnot know how the two continuous transition lines connect to the first-order transition\nline. The discussion at the beginning of Sec. 7 applies also in this case, with the only\ndifference that a unique continuous transition is excluded by the argument reported in\nSec. 2. A possible scenario, consistent with our numerical results, is shown in Fig. 19.\nThe crossover curves of the effective exponents are quite similar to those of the \u03c64 model,\nat least for C not too negative, as we will further discuss in Sec. 9.\n9. Crossover behavior\nIn the preceding sections we established that the FFXY model and the \u03c64 and IsXY\nmodels in a large parameter region undergo two transitions that belong to the Ising and\nKT universality classes respectively. However, the eventual Ising critical regime at the\nchiral transition is reached after a crossover regime which is surprisingly similar in all\nmodels considered. For example, in most cases we find a rather extended preasymptotic\nregion in which the effective correlation-length exponent \u03bdeff is approximately equal to\n0.8. Similar values have also been observed in other models related to the FFXY model,\nsee Table 1. This suggests that this crossover is somewhat universal.\nFirst, we consider the behavior at the chiral transition and show that any RG\nquantity scales approximately as\nR = fR (L/l),\n\n(51)\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n41\n\n1.0\n\nRs\n\n0.1\n\nFFXY\nD=1/5\nD=1/3\nD=1/2\nD=1\nD=2\nD=4\n\n0.01\n\n0.10\n\nLr\n\n1.00\n\n10.00\n\n1.00\n\n10.00\n\n1.0\n\nRs\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\nFFXY\nC=0.3\nC=0.2\nC=0.1\nC=0\nC=-0.2\nC=-0.5\nC=-1\nC=-2\nC=-3\n0.10\n\nLr\n\nFigure 24.

In Fig. 25 we plot these quantities in terms\nof Lr = L/l, using the rescaling factors determined in the analysis of Rs . Again we\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n43\n\nobserve a good universal behavior.\u00b6 The quality of the data collapse worsens as D or\n\u2212C increases. Indeed, while for Rs all data collapse on a single curve, except for a few\nFFXY points that correspond to small values of L (L <\n\u223c 10), the data of Bs\u03c6 for D = 4\n4\n(\u03c6 model) and C = \u22122, \u22123 (IsXY model) show some systematic deviations. They\napparently require a rescaling l that differs by approximately a factor of 2 for D = 4\nand by a factor of 5 for C = \u22123 from that determined by using Rs . Note that these\n(c)\n(c)\ndeviations are not due to small values of L and/or of \u03bes , since \u03bes \u2248 88 for the \u03c64\n(c)\nmodel at D = 4, and \u03bes >\n\u223c 200 for the IsXY model at C = \u22122, \u22123. Most probably,\nthe behavior is influenced by the first-order transition line that is present nearby in the\nphase diagram.\nIt is easy to realize that, given two different models, l1 /l2 corresponds to the ratio\nof the corresponding spin correlation lengths at the chiral transition. Indeed, since\n(c)\nRs = fRs (L/l) and \u03bes \u2192 \u03bes for large L, we must have fRs (x) = a/x for x \u2192 \u221e, where\n(c)\na is model independent, and \u03bes = l/a. Thus, the scaling we observe implies that Rs is\n(c)\nan approximately universal function of L/\u03bes . Assuming universality, this allows us to\n(c)\nestimate the spin correlation length \u03bes at the chiral transition even in those cases in\n(c)\nwhich our simulations did not probe the regime L \u226b \u03bes that allows us to obtain a direct\n(c)\nestimate of \u03bes . For example, using the above-reported estimates of the optimal ratio\n(c)\n(c)\nl/lFFXY and \u03bes = 118(1) for the FFXY model, we infer that \u03bes \u2248 830, 530, 380, 212, 118\n(c)\nrespectively for D = 1/5, 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2 (\u03c64 model) and \u03bes \u2248 131, 310, 670 respectively\nfor C = \u22120.2, \u22120.5, \u22121 (IsXY model). The result for the \u03c64 model at D = 2 is consistent\n(c)\nwith the estimate \u03bes = 116(3) obtained for L = 500. In Fig. 24 and in those we shall\n(c)\npresent below we have fixed lFFXY = 118 \u2248 \u03bes , so that we are reporting the data in\n(c)\nterms of Lr \u2261 L/\u03bes .\nIn Fig. 26 we do the same analysis for the helicity modulus \u03a5. Again, the collapse of\n\u2212\u01eb\nthe data is remarkable. In a quite large region, i.e. for Lr <\n\u223c 0.5, \u03a5 decreases as Lr with\n\u01eb \u2248 0.33, with differences of at most 10%.+ As already discussed in Sec. 8, a power(c)\nlaw decay is expected in the IsXY model for L \u226a \u03bes and gives the effective fractal\ndimension of the geometrical clusters, dgc = 2 \u2212 \u01eb. The universal behavior observed in\nFig. 26 shows that a power-law decay also characterizes the FFXY and \u03c64 models. It\nis interesting to note that the value \u01eb \u2248 0.33 is much larger than the value \u01eb = 5/96\ncorresponding to the fractal dimension dIgc = 187/96 of Ising geometrical clusters: in\n(c)\nthe IsXY model, this is the dimension of the geometrical clusters only for L \u226b \u03bes .\n(c)\nThis shows, once again, that chiral and spin modes are strongly coupled for L <\n\u223c \u03bes . A\n\u00b6 The Binder parameter Bs\u03c6 is expected to converge to 3/2 for Lr \u2192 \u221e (a simple argument predicts:\n\u22121/4\n, a > 0). Nonetheless, for Lr \u2248 10, such a quantity is still quite different from its\nBs\u03c6 = 3/2 + aLr\nasymptotic value.\n+\n\u2212\u01eb\nMore precisely, fitting the available data for L >\n\u223c 10 and Lr <\n\u223c 0.5 to \u03a5 = cLr , we find \u01eb = 0.335(8)\n2\n2\n(\u03c7 /d.o.f. \u2248 1.1) for the FFXY model, \u01eb = 0.332(2) (\u03c7 /d.o.f. \u2248 0.5) for the \u03c64 model with D = 1/2,\n\u01eb = 0.297(4) (\u03c72 /d.o.f. \u2248 0.5) for the \u03c64 model with D = 1/5, \u01eb = 0.360(5) (\u03c72 /d.o.f. \u2248 1.1) for the\nIsXY model with C = 0, \u01eb = 0.352(3) (\u03c72 /d.o.f. \u2248 0.7) for the IsXY model with C = \u22120.5 (d.o.f. is\nthe numer of degrees of freedom of the fit).

As it can be seen from Fig. 24, for Lr <\n\u223c 0.5\n\u2212\u01eb\nRs scales as Lr , although in this case \u01eb is much smaller, \u01eb \u2248 0.1. Note that, if the\nbehavior we observe for 0.02 <\n\u223c Lr <\n\u223c 0.5 holds up to Lr = 0 we would obtain Rs , \u03a5 \u2192 \u221e\nfor Lr \u2192 0.\nIn Fig. 27 we plot the effective exponents 1/\u03bdeff , defined as in Eq. (37), as obtained\nfrom the derivative of Rc , Bc , and Rs with respect to J, versus the rescaled lattice size\n(c)\nLr = L/l = L/\u03bes . We use the same rescaling factors l as above. The agreement is quite\ngood, although the quality of the collapse for the chiral exponent \u03bdeff is not as impressive\nas what is observed for the spin-related quantities Rs , Bs , and Bs\u03c6 . These crossover\ncurves show a quite interesting pattern. The effective exponents 1/\u03bdeff derived from Rc\nand Bc show first a rather flat region in which 1/\u03bdeff \u2248 1.3, corresponding to \u03bdeff \u2248 0.8.\n(c)\nTherefore, a FSS analysis limited to values L <\n\u223c \u03bes would apparently provide the\nestimate \u03bd \u2248 0.8 for the critical exponent associated with the chiral correlation length,\n(c)\nas found in the FSS analysis of Sec. 7.2.1. Only by using larger lattices, i.e. L \u226b \u03bes , can\none observe the asymptotic Ising critical behavior. Note that, to make things worse, the\n(c)\nasymptotic approach is nonmonotonic: for L \u2248 \u03bes the exponent \u03bdeff starts to increase,\n(c)\nbecomes larger than the Ising value (the curves of 1/\u03bdeff have a minimum for L/\u03bes \u2248 2\ncorresponding to \u03bdeff \u2248 1.1 for Rc and \u03bdeff \u2248 1.2 for Bc ) and then eventually converges\nto the Ising value. The effective exponents 1/\u03bdeff associated with the spin variables show\na similar crossover behavior. The exponent derived from Rs must converge to \u22121 for\n(c)\n(c)\nL \u226b \u03bes , since the spin correlation length is finite. However, for L <\n\u223c \u03bes the data of\n1/\u03bdeff show a plateau at 1/\u03bdeff \u2248 1.1, see Fig. 27. In the case of Bs and Bs\u03c6 (not shown)\nwe observe an analogous plateau, but at 1/\u03bdeff \u2248 1.7. Substantial deviations from the\nabove behaviors are observed for D = 4 in the \u03c64 model and for C = \u22122, \u22123 in the\nIsXY model, as one can already see from Figs. 17 and 23 where 1/\u03bdeff is plotted versus\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n1.4\n\n45\n\nfrom Rc\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n\nfrom Bc\n\n1/\u03bdeff\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n\nfrom Rs\n\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n\nFFXY\n\u03c6, D=1/3\n\u03c6, D=1/2\n\u03c6, D=1\nIsXY, C=-0.5\nIsXY, C=-0.2\nIsXY, C=0\nIsXY, C=0.2\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\nLr\nFigure 27.

Again, we observe an approximate collapse of the data. A more\nquantitative check can be done by observing that the approximate universality implies\nfor L \u2192 \u221e\n\u2206Bc = a(L/\u03bes(c) )\u22127/4 ,\n\n(52)\n(c)\n\nwhere a is model independent. If we define b \u2261 a(\u03bes )7/4 , the previous equation gives a\nrelation between the ratio of the constants b in different models and the ratio of the spin\ncorrelation lengths. Using the estimates of b reported in Secs. 6.1 and 8 for the FFXY\nmodel and IsXY model with C = 0, we find bFFXY /bIsXY,C=0 = 4.0(3). This is in perfect\n(c)\n(c)\nagreement with the prediction bFFXY /bIsXY,C=0 = (\u03bes,FFXY /\u03bes,IsXY,C=0)7/4 = 4.1(1).\nThe results reported above show that, in the FFXY model and in the \u03c64 and IsXY\nmodels for a rather extended region of parameters (respectively for 0 < D <\n\u223c 2 and\n\u22121 <\n\u223cC <\n\u223c 0.2), the finite-size behavior at the chiral transition is somewhat universal.\nA natural conjecture is that this universality is controlled by a multicritical point (or by\na line of multicritical points of the same type) where chiral and spin degrees of freedom\nbecome both critical. If this conjecture is correct, one must observe a universal crossover\nbehavior also at the spin transition, with the same rescaling factors.\nIn Fig. 30 we report Rs \u2261 \u03bes /L and \u03a5 at the spin transitions for the three models for\nwhich we have a reliable estimate of Jsp . The rescaling factors l are those determined at\nthe chiral transition. The agreement is again quite good. The existence of scaling at the\ntwo transitions with the same rescaling factors is another piece of evidence in favor of the\nmulticritical origin of the universality we observe. This hypothesis is also supported by\n(c)\n(s)\n(s)\nthe fact that the ratio \u03bes /\u03bec is approximately constant.

Indeed, see Fig. 26, the helicity modulus is clearly larger than the XY value\n\u03a5XY \u2248 0.6365.

Binder cumulant Bs\u03c6 at fixed Rc , versus Lr = L/l. The rescalings l are\nthe same as in Fig. 24. Note the logarithmic scale on both axes.\n\nmain results can be summarized as follows.\n(i) In all models the LT phase is characterized by the breaking of the Z2 symmetry\nwith a chiral magnetization, and by quasi-long-range order associated with the breaking\nof the O(2) rotational symmetry. We find that the critical behavior of the spin modes\nis controlled by the same line of Gaussian fixed points as in the standard XY model.\nIndeed, we verify that the spin correlation length, the helicity modulus, and the exponent\n\u03b7 satisfy the same universal finite-size relations that hold in the LT phase of the XY\nmodel.\n(ii) We conclusively show that the square-lattice FFXY model undergoes two very\nclose transitions, respectively at Jsp and Jch , with Jsp > Jch . The transition at Jsp is\na KT transition associated with the spin modes, while for J = Jch there is an Ising\ntransition where the chiral Z2 symmetry is restored. For Jch < J < Jsp , spins are\nparamagnetic but chiral symmetry is broken. The Ising and KT transitions are very\nclose: \u03b4 \u2261 (Jsp \u2212 Jch )/Jch = 0.0159(2).\n(iii) The phase diagram of the \u03c64 model for U = 1 is shown in Fig. 8. It presents\ntwo qualitatively different regions. There is a region in which the behavior is analogous\nto that of the FFXY model, with an Ising and a KT transition at Jch < Jsp . These\ntransitions are very close: we find \u03b4 \u2261 (Jsp \u2212 Jch )/Jch <\n\u223c 0.003 for all values of D in the\ntwo-transition region (\u03b4 = 0.0025(2) for D = 1/2). For D > D \u2217 with 34 < D \u2217 \u2248 49,\nwe find instead a single first-order transition. We do not know how the two continuous\ntransition lines connect to the unique first-order one (see the discussion at the beginning\nof Sec. 7). A possibility is shown in Fig. 8: the Ising line ends at a tricritical Ising point,\nwhich is the endpoint of the first-order transition line; then the KT line meets the firstorder one. Since for D = 0 there is no finite-J transition, it is natural to assume that\nthe two transition lines get closer and closer as D \u2192 0 and meet at 1/J = 0, D = 0,\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n50\n\nwhich thus acts as an O(4)-symmetric multicritical point. The critical lines approach\nthe multicritical point according to Jch \u223c ln D \u22121 and \u03b4 \u223c 1/ ln D \u22121 for D \u2192 0.\n(iv) The phase diagram of the IsXY model (7) is shown in Fig. 19. In Sec. 2 we\nargue that the IsXY model cannot undergo a continuous transition in which chiral and\nspin modes become both critical. Our MC results support this fact. As in the \u03c64 model,\nthere is a rather extented region in which there is an Ising and a KT transition with\nJch > Jsp . The Ising and KT transitions are close in most of the cases. For example, we\n\u2217\nfind \u03b4 \u2261 (Jsp \u2212 Jch )/Jch = 0.0167(7) for C = 0. For C < C \u2217 , \u22127 <\n\u223cC <\n\u223c \u22125, we find a\nsingle first-order transition. Again, we do not know how the two continuous transition\nlines connect to the unique first-order one. A possibility is shown in Fig. 19.\n(v) We do not find evidence of continuous transitions-but we cannot completely\nexclude their presence-where chiral and spin modes become both critical, giving rise\nto a new universality class. Thus, our results do not support the field-theoretical results\nof Refs. [70, 65], which provided some evidence for the existence of a stable fixed point\nin the RG flow of the LGW continuous theory (5). However, they are not necessarily\nin contradiction, since the lattice models considered here may be outside the attraction\ndomain of the stable fixed point found in Refs. [70, 65]. Note also that the existence\nof two continuous transitions at fixed bare parameters (i.e., at fixed D and U, or C)\nmeans that the critical modes are not appropriately described by the LGW theory, at\nleast in the cases considered in this paper. Actually, it suggests that a field theory with\nan Ising and an XY field, for instance the multicritical theory of Refs. [96, 102], might\nbe more appropriate.\n(c)\n(vi) In most cases the spin correlation length \u03bes at the chiral transition is quite\n(c)\n(c)\nlarge. For example, \u03bes \u2248 118 in the FFXY model, \u03bes \u2248 53 in the IsXY model for\n(c)\nC = 0, and \u03bes \u2248 380 in the \u03c64 model for D = 1/2. The presence of this additional\nlength scale makes the observation of the expected Ising behavior quite problematic.\n(c)\nWe find that Ising behavior is observed only for L \u226b \u03bes , which in turn requires very\nlarge lattices.\n(vii) At the chiral and spin transitions we observe a preasymptotic regime that is\nuniversal to some extent. Indeed, in the FFXY model, in the \u03c64 model with U = 1 and\n0<D<\n\u223c 2, and in the IsXY model with \u22121 <\n\u223cC<\n\u223c 0.2, we find that RG quantities at\nthe transitions scale approximately as\nR(L) \u2248 fR (L/l),\n\n(53)\n\nwhere fR (x) is a model-independent function that is of course different at the two\ntransitions. The rescalings l are model dependent and set the length scale. Given two\n(c)\n(c)\n(s)\n(s)\ndifferent models, l1 /l2 is equal to the ratios \u03bes,1 /\u03bes,2 or \u03bec,1 /\u03bec,2 . One might expect\n(c) (s)\nscaling (53) to be valid for L \u2192 \u221e, l \u2192 \u221e (or, equivalently, \u03bes , \u03bec \u2192 \u221e) at fixed\nratio. However, these conditions are not sufficient to observe this universal behavior.\nSubstantial deviations are observed in other parameter regions, e.g., for D = 4 in the \u03c64\n(c)\nmodel and for C = \u22122, \u22123 in the IsXY, even though \u03bes is large. This may be due to the\ninfluence of the first-order transition present for large values of D and \u2212C. Note that,\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n51\n\nat the chiral transition, the effective chiral exponent \u03bd shows an intermediate region in\nwhich it is approximately equal to 0.8. This explains earlier results obtained by using\n(c)\nsmaller lattices. By using only data with L <\n\u223c \u03bes one would obtain \u03bd = 0.8 instead\nof the Ising value. Scaling (53) may be due to a multicritical point where chiral and\nspin modes are both critical. The analysis of the crossover curves for L/l \u2192 0 allows\nus to exclude a decoupled Ising-XY multicritical transition. A zero-temperature point\nis instead compatible with the numerical data. Note that the universal behavior we\nhave observed here concerns the finite-size behavior at criticality, but of course similar\nphenomena are expected in the thermodynamic limit close to the critical points. If\ntch and tsp are the reduced temperatures and \u03b4 the temperature difference of the two\ntransitions, Ising and KT behavior can only be observed if tch , tsp \u226a \u03b4. In the opposite\nlimit, 1 \u226b tch , tsp >\n\u223c \u03b4 we expect instead a universal crossover behavior.\nThe identification of the multicritical point is a problem that is still open and\nrequires further investigation. If the relevant multicritical point is a zero-temperature\ntransition, as the MC data suggest, then the O(4) point discussed in Sec. 7.3 is a\npossible candidate. Otherwise, one should also the consider the finite-temperature\nmulticritical point expected in the phase diagram of the generalized IsXY model [29]\nwith Hamiltonian\nX\nHIsXY = \u2212J\n[(A + B\u03c3x \u03c3y )~sx * ~sy + C\u03c3x \u03c3y ] ,\n(54)\nhxyi\n\nin frustrated XY models with modulated couplings [16, 22, 103] (they are obtained by\ngeneralizing the FFXY model (3), setting jxy = \u2212\u03b7 with \u03b7 > 0 on the antiferromagnetic\nlinks), and in \u03c64 theories in which the field-interchange symmetry is broken or in which\none of the two O(2) symmetries is broken by adding, for instance, an interaction term\n~ 1,x * \u03c6\n~ 2,x )2 .\nof the form (\u03c6\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Pasquale Calabrese for useful discussions, and Alberto Ciampa and Maurizio\nDavini for their technical assistance to manage the computer clusters where the Monte\nCarlo simulations have been done.

The FFXY model\nThe algorithm we used for the simulation of the FFXY model is based on the results of\nRef. [60]. These authors found that the addition of a certain number of overrelaxation\n(OR) sweeps to a local Metropolis sweep makes the algorithm more efficient. They\nalso suggested an efficient method to generate the proposed new spin in the Metropolis\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n52\n\nupdate. Every sweep over the lattice \u2217 one chooses a single unit vector ~r = (cos \u03b1, sin \u03b1),\nwhere \u03b1 is uniformly distributed in [0, 2\u03c0). Then, for each site x the proposal is\n~sx\u2032 = 2(~r * ~sx )~r \u2212 ~sx .\nThis proposal is accepted with the Metropolis probability\nh\ni\n\u2032\nA = Min e\u2212(H \u2212H) , 1 .\n\n(A.1)\n\n(A.2)\n\nThe advantage of this proposal compared with more standard ones is that no\nrandom numbers are needed and also no expensive trigonometric function is evaluated.\nFurthermore, the authors of Ref. [60] showed that the autocorrelation times in terms\nof sweeps of the Metropolis update with this type of proposal (in the following we will\nrefer to it as MR update) are essentially the same as those of a Metropolis update in\nwhich the new spin is obtained by a random rotation of the old one. At the chiral\ntransition the acceptance rate of the MR update is approximately 25%, in agreement\nwith Ref. [60].\nIn most of our simulations we used a demon version [104] of the Metropolis update.\nWe indicate the demon version of any update by a adding a letter D. The demon version\nof the MR update is therefore denoted by DMR. In this framework, one introduces a\nP\ndemon field dx \u2208 [0, \u221e) with distribution exp(\u2212 x dx ) and replaces the Metropolis\naccept/reject step in the following way. One defines\nd\u2032x = dx \u2212 H\u2032 + H.\n\n(A.3)\n\nIf d\u2032x \u2265 0, the proposal is accepted and ~sx , dx are replaced by ~sx\u2032 , d\u2032x . Otherwise, the\ndemon and the spin keep their old value. This way the generation of a random number\nand, more importantly, the evaluation of the exponential is avoided. However, these\nupdates do not change the sum\nX\ndx + H.\n(A.4)\nx\n\nTherefore, one must also perform heat-bath updates of all demons, by taking dx =\n\u2212 ln zx , where zx is a random number uniformly distributed in (0,1]. It is easy to see\nthat by updating dx before the update of ~sx , one recovers the standard Metropolis\nalgorithm. Also note that the acceptance rate of the demon version of the Metropolis\nupdate is exactly the same as that of the standard one, although the autocorrelation\ntimes might increase.\nThe local overrelaxation (OR) update is given by\n~sx\u2032 =\nP\n\n~\n2~sx * S\n~ \u2212 ~sx ,\nS\nS2\n\n(A.5)\n\n~ =\nwhere S\nsy is the sum of ~sy over the nearest neighbors y of site x. One\ny.nn.x jxy ~\nadvantage of the OR update is that no random numbers and no evaluations of the\nexponential function are needed. In the case of the standard XY model one finds that\n\u2217 We have generated a new ~r more frequently, namely for each row of the lattice. We have not tested\nwhether or not this gives an advantage over choosing a new ~r just once every sweep.\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n53\n\nTable A1.

In contrast, for the FFXY model at the chiral transition\nthe authors of Ref. [60] find only a speed-up by a constant factor.\nA complete cycle of the algorithm we used is:\n\u2022 Heat-bath of the demons;\n\n\u2022 5\u00d7[(DMR+OR) sweep + Nor OR sweeps].\nHere (DMR + OR) means that a single-site DMR update is followed by an elementary\nOR update at the same site. At the chiral transition we used Nor = 3, while at the KT\ntransition larger values of Nor were used.\nWe have implemented a parallel program using the MPI library. To this end, we\nhave divided the lattice in one direction into sublattices of size l \u00d7 L, where l \u00d7 nP = L\nand nP is the number of processes that is used. In order to speed up the simulation, we\nalso did some kind of parallelization in the second direction, running the OR sweep in\nthe second direction in the following way:\nfor (x1=0;x1<L/2;x1++) {OR site (x0,x1); OR site (x0,x1+L/2)},\nwhere (x0, x1) is a lattice point. This small change allows a better use of the floatingpoint pipelines and gives a speedup of approximately 30%. On a server with 4 1.8GHz\nOpteron CPUs, one complete update cycle takes 0.26s for L = 1000. Roughly speaking,\none cycle takes 1 s on one Opteron processor with one core.\nIn table A1 we report the integrated autocorrelation times of the chiral susceptibility\nfor L \u2265 256. The couplings J are close to the chiral critical value Jch = 2.20632(5).\nFitting all data given in table A1 we get Nlocal \u03c4ch = 0.022(8) \u00d7 L1.91(6) with \u03c72 /d.o.f.=\n0.99.\nAt the KT transition, critical slowing down can be efficiently reduced by using\noverrelaxation updates. In the case of the standard XY model, at the transition one\nshould increase Nor as Nor \u221d L. We found that also in the case of the FFXY model\nat the KT transition this procedure leads to very small autocorrelation times. For\nJ = 2.242 [Jsp = 2.2415(5)] and L = 1024, by using Nor = 12 we find an integrated\nautocorrelation time \u03c4sp \u2248 5.4(5) in units of cycles (heat bath of the demons followed\nby 5\u00d7[(DMR+OR)+12 OR] sweeps).

The Ising-XY model\nFor the IsXY model we used three types of updates. We performed single-cluster [83]\nand overrelaxation updates of the spins ~s keeping the chiral field \u03c3 fixed, and Metropolis\nupdates in which \u03c3 and ~s are both changed. The proposal for the Metropolis update is\n\u03c3x\u2032 = \u2212\u03c3x ,\n\n~sx\u2032 = (cos \u03b1, sin \u03b1),\n\n(A.6)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a random number uniformly distributed in [0, 2\u03c0). Close to the chiral\ntransition, the acceptance rate of this update is approximately 11% for C = 0 and\n3% for C = \u22127. We mostly used the demon version of this update (in the following we\nrefer to it as DM update).\nBetween two measurements we perform Nlocal local cycles [a local cycle consists in a\nheat bath of the demons and in 5\u00d7(DM sweep + OR sweep)] followed by Nsingle singlecluster updates. On one 2.2 GHz Opteron CPU, one local cycle takes approximately\n0.20s for L = 512.\nIn Table A2 we report the integrated autocorrelation times of the chiral\nsusceptibility for lattices with 64 \u2264 L \u2264 360. The couplings J are close to the chiral\ncritical value Jch = 1.4684(1). The number of single-cluster updates was chosen ad hoc,\nsince the cluster update has little influence on the autocorrelation times. Fitting Nlocal \u03c4ch\nfor L \u2265 128 (we are neglecting here the role of the single-cluster updates) we obtain\nNlocal \u03c4ch = 0.12(4) \u00d7 L1.95(6) with \u03c72 /d.o.f.= 0.53. At the chiral transition, the cluster\nalgorithm leaves the dynamic critical exponent substantially unchanged, i.e. z \u2248 2. A\nsimilar observation holds for other values of C, whenever the transition is of second\norder.\nCritical slowing down at the KT transition and in the LT phase is essentially\neliminated by the single-cluster updates. For instance, for L = 512 and J = 1.492\nwe get \u03c4sp = 0.94(1) in units of measurements, where a measurement was performed\nafter 4 single-cluster updates and 20 local cycles.\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n55\n\nAppendix A.3.

Hence, the algorithm becomes\ninefficient. To deal with this problem, we constructed proposals that are specifically\nadapted to this situation:\n(M2) We change only one field at each time. With probability 1/2 we change either \u03c61\nor \u03c62 using the proposal\n\u03c6\u203211,x = \u03c611,x + s(r1,x \u2212 0.5),\n\n\u03c6\u203212,x = \u03c612,x + s(r2,x \u2212 0.5)\n\n(A.8)\n\nor the analogous one for \u03c62,x . Here r1,x and r2,x are random numbers with uniform\ndistribution in [0, 1). The step size s is chosen so that the acceptance rate is\napproximately 25%. This way, we achieve an efficient update of the large component\nof the field.\n(MLE) We exchange the lengths of the two fields. The proposal is given by\n~\n~ 1,x ,\n~ \u2032 = |\u03c62,x | \u03c6\n\u03c6\n1,x\n~\n|\u03c61,x |\n\n~\n~ \u2032 = |\u03c61,x | \u03c6\n~ 2,x .\n\u03c6\n2,x\n~\n|\u03c62,x |\n\n(A.9)\n\nThis type of update should speed up the chiral degrees of freedom. The acceptance\nrate is 14% at the chiral transition at D = 49. One could have also exchanged the\ncomponents of the two fields, using\n~\u2032 = \u03c6\n~ 2,x ,\n\u03c6\n1,x\n\n~\u2032 = \u03c6\n~ 1,x .\n\u03c6\n2,x\n\n(A.10)\n\nHowever, this proposal has a smaller acceptance rate than (A.9).\nBeside these updates we also used local updates that leave invariant part of the\nHamiltonian and are close in spirit to overrelaxation updates. A first possibility\n(OR4) consists in performing a field reflection that keeps the O(4)-invariant part of\nthe Hamiltonian constant:\n~ ~\n~x\n~ x\u2032 = 2 \u03c6x * S S\n~ \u2212\u03c6\n(A.11)\n\u03c6\n~2\nS\n~ is the sum over the fields of the four neighbors of x. For convenience, we define\nwhere S\n~ x = (\u03c611,x , \u03c612,x , \u03c621,x , \u03c622,x ). This type of update has no\nthe four-component vector \u03c6\nfree parameters. The remaining part of the Hamiltonian is taken into account in an\n\n\fMulticritical behavior in the fully frustrated XY model and related systems\n\n56\n\naccept/reject step. We expect the acceptance rate to decrease with increasing D. At\nthe chiral transition we find 87%, 70%, 61%, 43%, 40% for D = 1/2, 2, 4, 34, 99. Note\nthat it seems to have a finite limit as D \u2192 \u221e. In the simulations we used a demon\nversion (DOR4) with a single demon (not one for each site).\nA second possibility is the overrelaxation of one component of the field (OR1). The\nHamiltonian for a single component \u03c6ij,x of the field, keeping all other fields fixed, has\nthe form\nH\u0304(\u03c6ij,x ) = a\u03c6ij,x + b\u03c62ij,x + c\u03c64ij,x .\n\n(A.12)\n\n\u03c6\u2032ij,x = \u2212\u03c6ij,x \u2212 a/b\n\n(A.13)\n\nThe proposal\n\nkeeps the value of a\u03c6ij,x + b\u03c62ij,x constant. The quartic part of the Hamitonian is taken\ninto account in an accept/reject step. The acceptance rate for this type of move is 67%\nat the chiral transition for D = 49 (56% for D = 0.5). Such a step, in a demon version,\nwas performed subsequently for each of the four components of the field at a given site.\nWe used a single demon for the whole lattice, refreshing it before the update of each\nsite (this is equivalent to using a demon for each lattice site and updating it before each\nsweep).\nBecause of the different features of the model for large and small values of D we used\ndifferent local update cycles in the two regimes. For D \u2264 4 we used a local cycle with an\nM4 sweep followed by Nor DOR4 sweeps. In most of the cases we used Nor = 8, but there\nis no sharp dependence of the efficiency on Nor . For large values of D a typical local\ncycle is instead: (M2+DOR4) sweep, 2 DOR4 sweeps, DOR1 sweep, 2 DOR4 sweeps,\n(MLE+DOR4) sweep, and finally 2 DOR4 sweeps. Here (M2+OR4) means a local M2\nupdate followed by a local DOR4 update on the same site; (MLE+DOR4) has the same\nmeaning. Beside the local cycle we also performed single-cluster updates: between two\nmeasurements we perform Nlocal local update cycles followed by Nsingle single-cluster\nupdates on each field.\nLet us look in more detail at the performance at D = 1/2. At the chiral transition,\nby using the local cycle (M4 + 8 DOR4), we obtain the autocorrelation times reported\nin Table A3. They are consistent with a critical exponent z = 2.\nAt the KT transition the cluster algorithm allows us to eliminate the slowing down\nof the spin degrees of freedom. For J = 1.47 and L = 2048 we find \u03c4sp = 2.2(3) in\nunits of measurements. Between two measurements we performed 10 local cycles and\n10 single-cluster updates on each field.\nAppendix B.

An analogous relation can be obtained for the ratio \u03be/L.\nAccording to the KT theory, the leading corrections to \u03c7, \u03be/L and \u03a5 in the LT\nphase are proportional to L\u22122x with x = \u03c0\u03b2 \u2212 2. Using Eq.
