The algebras\nof Bose, Fermi and infinite statistics can be viewed as\nthe special cases of the q-deformed commutation relation\nak a\u2020l \u2212 qa\u2020l ak = \u03b4kl with q = 1, \u22121 and 0 [2]. While\nBose and Fermi statistics are familiar in the standard\nmodel of particle physics, infinite statistics has becoming\nincreasingly attractive in recent years. Infinite statistics\nwith ak a\u2020l = \u03b4kl has a great many interesting properties.\nThough there is an obvious absence of locality in the theory of particles obeying infinite statistics, other important properties like cluster decomposition and the CPT\ntheorem still hold which makes it capable to be a sensible field theory. The nonlocality of the theory of infinite\nstatistics might be a virtue in the context of quantum\ngravity for that it provides a new way in searching new\nphysics beyond local quantum field theory which is based\non bosons and fermions. At present, infinite statistics has\nbeen applied on the discussions of black hole statistics [3\u2013\n6] and dark energy quanta [7\u20139].\nIt is known that bosonic and fermionic systems under the gravitational stability condition are subject to\nthe entropy bound A3/4 (we set G, ~, c, kB = 1 throughout), where A is the boundary area of the corresponding\nsystems. The A3/4 bound was first derived from a photon gas system by 't Hooft [10] and has been verified\nin more general contexts [11\u201315]. However, holographic\nprinciple tells that the maximum entropy contained in a\nregion should be the area of its boundary in Planck units\n[10, 16, 17]. There seems to be an entropy gap between\nthe A3/4 bound and the holographic entropy A. This entropy gap even has its cosmological counterpart, which\nbrings about a huge numerical differences from 1090 to\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: xiaoyong@hbu.edu.cn\n\n10120 at the present era of the universe [18]. It is natural to ask which mechanism can account for these absent\ndegrees of freedom and whether it is a part of a complete\ntheory of quantum gravity.\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the entropy bounds\nattached to the three types of statistics. We shall derive\nthe A3/4 bound for Bose, fermi statistics and their generalizations to parastatistics. Then we turn to the case\nof infinite statistics and study its entropy bound which\nwas not addressed before. Our main result is that the\nentropy bound of infinite statistics obeys the area law,\njust as the holographic principle requires. We shall also\ndiscuss the implications of this result.\n\nII.\n\nBOSE, FERMI STATISTICS AND THE A3/4\nBOUND\n\nThe entropy of bosonic and fermionic systems obeys\nthe A3/4 bound. This bound was first derived by 't Hooft\nby considering a thermal photon gas confined to a box\nof size l. By statistics mechanics, this system has entropy S \u223c l3 T 3 and energy E \u223c l3 T 4 . If there is no\nfurther limitation, one finds the entropy of the system is\nproportional to the volume l3 and there is no bound to\nthe entropy due to the arbitrary T . However, according\nto general relativity, the energy of the system cannot exceed the energy of a black hole of the same size. It gives\nE \u223c l3 T 4 6 Ebh \u223c l and leads to a critical temperature T \u223c l\u22121/2 . Substituting it into the entropy formula,\none easily finds the entropy bound Smax \u223c A3/4 , where\nA \u223c l2 is the boundary area of the system.\nFor later comparison with the analysis of infinite statistics, we give another derivation to the entropy bound\nA3/4 . It is known that Bose and Fermi statistics in\nthe high temperature limit can be viewed as Boltzmann\nstatistics except that the Gibbs factor N1 ! is introduced.\nThis factor is to offset the extra degrees of freedom of\nBoltzmann statistics caused by particle exchanging. Now\nwe start from this equivalent statistics and discuss the\ncorresponding entropy bound. The canonical partition\nfunction for a perfect gas of N particles obeying this\n\n\f2\nstatistics is\nZN\n\n1\n=\nN!\n\u223c\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ne\n\n\u2212\u03b2wi\n\ni\n\n!N\n\n1 3 3 N\n(l T ) ,\nN!\n\n1\n=\nN!\n\n\u0012 Z\n\u0013N\n3\n\u2212\u03b2w 2\nl\ne\nw dw\n(1)\n\nFor completeness, here we turn to study the entropy\nbounds of para-Bose and para-Fermi statistics. Parastatistics is characterized by its order p [27, 28]. For paraBose statistics at most p particles can be in an antisymmetric state. For para-Fermi statistics at most p particles\ncan be in a symmetric state. The operator realization of\nparastatistics of order p can be written as\na\u2020k =\n\n\u22121\n\nwhere T \u2261 \u03b2 . Note that we are considering massless particles, for that we aim to derive an entropy\nbound and the systems composed of particles with mass\ngenerally have less entropy.\n\u0010 3 3The\n\u0011 free energy is thus\nl T\nF = \u2212T ln ZN \u223c \u2212N T ln N . Its complete form is\n\u0011\n\u0010\n3 3\n\u2212N T ln( l NT ) + 1 , but we omit all those irrelevant coefficients to make the scaling behavior clear. Now we get\nthe energy and the entropy of the system\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202 ln Z\nE=\u2212\n\u223c N T,\n(2)\n\u2202\u03b2\nV,N\n\u0012 3 3\u0013\nl T\nS = ln Z + \u03b2E \u223c N ln\n.\n(3)\nN\nFrom Eq.(2) and Eq.(3), one can easily get\n\u0012 3 3\u0013\nl E\n,\nS \u223c N ln\nN4\n\n(4)\n\nFixing E, l and varying the entropy with respect to\nN , we get the maximum entropy S \u223c (El)3/4 . Taking into account the non-gravitational collapse condition E 6 Ebh \u223c l, one obtains the critical temperature\nT \u223c l\u22121/2 and the ultimate entropy bound\nSmax \u223c (Ebh l)3/4 \u223c A3/4 .\n\n(5)\n\nIt is worth to note one can also derive the entropy bound by directly examining the dimension of the\nphysically permitted Hilbert space of the bosonic and\nfermionic fields [13]. For bosonic fields, it means to count\nout the number of the field configurations\n| \u03a8 >=| n1 , n2 , n3 * * * >,\n\n(6)\n\ni=1\n\nHere ni is the particle number occupying the mode of\nfrequency wi . Due to the limitation (7), the dimension\nof the Hilbert space becomes finite and the realizable entropy finally has a bound A3/4 [13] . Moreover, the critical temperature T \u223c l\u22121/2 also finds its explanation as\nan effective ultraviolet cutoff \u039b, which means the number\nof states with wi > \u039b being occupied is negligible compared to the number of these states with only wi 6 \u039b\nbeing occupied. See [13] for details.\n\n(\u03c1)\u2020\n\nbk\n\n, ak =\n\n\u03c1=1\n\np\nX\n\n(\u03c1)\n\n(8)\n\nbk .\n\n\u03c1=1\n\n(\u03c1)\n\n(\u03c3)\u2020\n\nTo describe parabosons (parafermions), bk and bk\ncommute (anticommute) for \u03c1 = \u03c3 and anticommute\n(commute) for \u03c1 6= \u03c3. Obviously parastatistics reduces\nto the common Bose and Fermi statistics in the p = 1\ncase.\nDue to the statistical properties of para-Bose statistics, we write the grand-canonical partition function for\na collection of para-bosons of order p as\n\u039e=\n\n\u221e\nYX\n\n(1 + pe\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b2wi )ni ) =\n\ni ni =1\n\nY 1 + (p \u2212 1)e\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b2wi )\ni\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b2wi )\n\n(9)\n\nTo derive the entropy bound, we consider massless particles and let \u03b1 = 0. Thus\nZ\n3\nln \u039e \u223c l\n[ln(1 + (p \u2212 1)e\u2212\u03b2w ) \u2212 ln(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2w )]w2 dw\n\u223c c(p)l3 T 3 .\n\n(10)\nThe value of c(p) is a positive number which can be\napproximately evaluated and it monotonically increases\nwith increasing p. The energy and entropy is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202 ln \u039e\n\u223c c(p)l3 T 4 ,\nE=\u2212\n\u2202\u03b2\n(11)\nV\nS = ln \u039e + \u03b2E \u223c c(p)l3 T 3 .\nSo there is S \u223c c(p)1/4 (El)3/4 \u2264 c(p)1/4 A3/4 . The\ngrand-canonical partition function of a collection of parafermions can be written as\nY\nY X\n(1 + e\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b2wi ) )p .\n(\ne\u2212(\u03b1+\u03b2wi )ni )p =\n\u039e=\ni\n\nwhich satisfies the non-gravitational collapse condition\nX\nni wi 6 Ebh \u223c l.\n(7)\nE\u03a8 =\n\np\nX\n\nni =0,1\n\ni\n\n(12)\n\nThis easily leads to an entropy bound S \u223c p1/4 A3/4 . Accordingly, the order p only contributes to the coefficients\nof the expressions of the entropy bounds and doesn't\nchange their scaling behavior. The entropy bounds of\nparastatistics always has a A3/4 scaling.\nAll above confirms the validity of the A3/4 bound.\nThe local quantum field theory describing bosons and\nfermions can only account for a very small part of the\nholographic degrees of freedom. The entropy gap between A3/4 and A implies the complete theory of quantum gravity should include more physical elements beyond the conventional local quantum field theory.\n\n.\n\n\f3\nIII.\n\nINFINITE STATISTICS AND THE A\nBOUND\n\nWe begin with a concise review of the elementary ingredients of infinite statistics. The basic commutation\nrelation of infinite statistics is\nak a\u2020l = \u03b4kl .\n\n(13)\n\nAssume the existence of the vacuum state |0 > annihilated by all the annihilators. The entire state space can\nbe constructed by creation operators acting on the vacuum state in sequence. A general N particle state can\nbe written as\na\u2020jN\n\n* * * a\u2020j1 |0\n\n>.\n\nwhich leads to\n\nSo we have\n\n\u0001\nE \u223c N T, S \u223c N ln l3 T 3 .\nS \u223c N ln\n\nk1 ,k2\n\n(15)\n\nWith the help of Eq.(13), one can check easily\n[ni , aj ] = \u2212\u03b4ij aj .\n\n(16)\n\nThe subtlety here is the existence of a recursion pattern:\nP\nni = a\u2020i ai + a\u2020k ni ak . The operator ni acting on a state\nk\n\ngives the correct particle number occupying the mode\nof frequency wi . A summation gives the total number\noperator and the total energy operator\nX\nX\nni wi .\n(17)\nni , E =\nN=\ni\n\n\u223c (l3 T 3 )N ,\n\n(14)\n\nThe number operator ni has the form\nX \u2020 \u2020\nX \u2020 \u2020 \u2020\nni = a\u2020i ai +\nak ai ai ak +\nak1 ak2 ai ai ak2 ak1 + * * * ,\nk\n\nthe Gibbs factor N1 ! must be absent here for particle exchanging can provide distinct quantum states in the theory of infinite statistics. Thus the canonical partition\nfunction is written as\n!N \u0012 Z\n\u0013N\n\u221e\nX\n\u2212\u03b2wi\n= l3 e\u2212\u03b2w w2 dw\ne\nZN =\n(19)\ni\n\ni\n\nFor infinite statistics, particle exchanging can provide\ndistinct states. This property is very different from the\nconventional Bose and Fermi statistics. It is observed\nfrom the orthogonal relation\n< 0|ai1 * * * aiN a\u2020jN * * * a\u2020j1 |0 >= \u03b4i1 j1 * * * \u03b4iN jN ,\n\n(18)\n\nof two N particle states. This is an immediate result\nof the basic commutation relation (13). Since changing the order of the particles gives another state orthogonal to the original one, the particles obeying infinite statistics are virtually distinguishable. This kind\nof distinguishability implies a rediscovery of Boltzmann\nstatistics. Hence, infinite statistics is also called \"quantum Boltzmann statistics\" where \"quantum\" means the\nphase space is quantized according to quantum mechanics. In addition, infinite statistics can also be viewed as\nthe statistical property of identical particles with an infinite number of internal degrees of freedom. The particles\nare distinguishable by their internal states [2].\nNow we focus on the derivation of the entropy bound.\nConsider a system of N noninteracting massless particles obeying infinite statistics. Compared with Eq.(1),\n\n\u0012\n\nl3E 3\nN3\n\n\u0013\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\n,\n\nFixing E, l and varying the entropy with respect to N ,\nwe find the maximum S \u223c El. Interestingly, it takes the\nform as the famous \"Bekenstein entropy bound\" [19, 20].\nImposing the energy limitation from general relativity:\nE 6 Ebh , we find that the critical temperature is at T \u223c\nl\u22121 and the final entropy bound of infinite statistics obeys\nthe area law\nSmax \u223c Ebh l \u223c A.\n\n(22)\n\nIt is an interesting result. At first sight, since exchanging particles can provide new states, it is natural to expect infinite statistics has a higher entropy bound than\nA3/4 , but how can one expect it obeys the area law just\nas holographic principle requires? Considering that infinite statistics is the only consistent statistics other than\nBose and fermi statistics, the coincidence with the holographic principle is impressive. Furthermore, here the\ncritical temperature T is around l\u22121 . It means the behavior of the system is dominated by its long-wave components. All the information inside the size l of the system can be smeared out, which is similar to that of black\nhole physics. This partly explains why infinite statistics\ncan be effectively used to describe the properties of black\nholes as suggested in [5, 6].\nAs a supplement, here we make a verification to the\nresult (22) by direct counting the number of the microscopic states contributing to the entropy. When massless\nfields are confined to a region of size l, the momenta will\nbe quantized as ~k \u223c 1l (mx , my , mz ). The frequencies of\nthe modes are wi = |k~i |. Then we can use a\u2020ki to construct\nall the basis of the Hilbert space of the infinite statistics fields. The general field configuration P\nis exhibited in\nEq.(14). We impose a further limitation\nni wi 6 Ebh\ni=1\n\nto exclude the states with energy larger than black hole\nfor the Hilblert space to be physically accessible. This\nrequirement causes the dimension of the Hilbert space to\nbe finite.\nThe critical temperature T \u223c l\u22121 also serves as an\neffective cutoff \u039b, which means the dominate states to\n\n\f4\nthe entropy are these with only wi 6 \u039b being occupied.\nHence we can consider a simplified system which contains\nonly the three lowest momentum modes ~k1 \u223c 1l (1, 0, 0),\n~k2 \u223c 1 (0, 1, 0), ~k3 \u223c 1 (0, 0, 1). Now we can write out all\nl\nl\nthe corresponding field configurations as the form similar\nto\nN\n\n}|\n{\nz\na\u2020k3 a\u2020k2 a\u2020k1 * * * a\u2020k3 a\u2020k2 a\u2020k1 |0 >,\n\n(23)\n\nThe next step is to count the number of them. When the\nsystem has the critical energy Ebh , the particle number\nbh\nN of the system is N \u223c E1/l\n\u223c Ebh l \u223c A. Sine the\nthree modes have the same energy, the most probable\ndistribution of the particles on these modes is each mode\nbeing occupied by N3 particles. Due to the exchanging\nproperty of infinite statistics, the number of different field\nconfigurations is\nW =\n\nNN\nN!\nN\nA\n\u223c\n\u0001 \u223c3 \u223c3 ,\nN N N\nN N\n!\n!\n!\n3 3 3\n\n(24)\n\n3\n\nThen we get an area entropy\n\nS = ln W \u223c Ebh l \u223c A.\n\n(25)\n\nIt supports our earlier result from thermodynamical analysis.\nIn fact, by choosing proper parameters it is not hard\nto obtain an area-form entropy from infinite statistics.\nThis fact is usually exploited to discuss the entropy of\nblack hole or dark energy [6\u20138]. However, the bound to\nthe entropy is another meaningful question worthy to be\naddressed [5]. In some practical context the entropy may\nappear to be unbounded. For example, if one starts from\n3/2\na non-relativistic partition function ZN = (l3 (mT ) )N\nfor particles with mass, the derived entropy is Smax \u223c\nmEl2 . Though choosing particle mass and energy to be\nm \u223c l\u22121 , E \u223c l can lead to an area entropy S \u223c A,\ngenerally the entropy is unbounded. The key to solve\nthis problem is to consider the complete relativistic partition function ZN \u223c (l3 (mT )3/2 e\u2212m/T )N , one can check\nml\nroughly the maximum entropy is Smax \u223c 1+m\n2 l2 (El) <\nA. It is crucial to introduce the static mass term e\u2212m/T\nto get the bound.\n\nof (para-)Bose and (para-)Fermi statistics obey the A3/4\nlaw, while the bound of infinite statistics obeys the area\nlaw. When a bosonic or fermionic system collapses to\nform a black hole, the system will be controlled by gravity and the entropy will evolve from A3/4 to A. So the\nentropy gap between A3/4 to A should be explained by\na final theory of quantum gravity. Now infinite statistics\nprovides a new way to fill up this gap. This suggests that\nthere might be a relationship between infinite statistics\nand quantum gravity.\nThe theory of infinite statistics has intriguing properties, such as nonlocality and non-extensive entropy, which\nresemble these of gravitational systems. So it is not weird\nto conjecture that infinite statistics serves as an essential ingredient of the complete theory of quantum gravity. For example, Strominger has argued that the gas of\ncharged extremal black holes should obey infinite statistics [3]. In addition, the large N limit of SU (N ) matrix\ntheory can be effectively described by the master fields\nobeying the infinite statistics algebra ak a\u2020l = \u03b4kl [4, 21\u2013\n25]. Since the large N limit of SU (N ) theory is equivalent to the theory of gravity by virtue of techniques like\nAdS/CFT, infinite statistics should also play a part in\nquantum gravity. Whatever, at present there are only\na limited number of clues on the relationship between\ninfinite statistics and quantum gravity. Many open questions should be further clarified.\nBy symmetrizing and anti-symmetrizing the state\nspace of infinite statistics, the bosonic and fermionic subspaces can be retrieved. So there should be a transition mechanism from the infinite statistics theory to the\nconventional quantum field theory describing bosons and\nfermions. We notice there has been an attempt on this\nquestion, which suggested infinite statistics is related to\nthe new physics in high energy scale and discussed the hierarchy problem from the electroweak scale to the Planck\nscale [26]. This is also a question worthy of further study.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe have examined the entropy bounds of the three\ntypes of statistics.
