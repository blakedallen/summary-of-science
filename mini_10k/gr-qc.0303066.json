Currently, an international array of first-generation, kilometer-scale laser interferometric\ngravitational-wave detectors, consisting of GEO 600 [2], LIGO [3], TAMA 300 [4] and VIRGO [5], targeted at gravitationalwaves in the acoustic band from 10 Hz to 10 kHz, is going into operation. These first-generation detectors are all Michelson\ninterferometers with suspended mirrors. Injecting a strong carrier light from the bright port, the anti-symmetric mode of armlengths oscillations (e.g. excited by a gravitational wave) yields a sideband modulation field in the anti-symmetric (optical)\nmode which is detected at the dark output port. To yield a high sensitivity to gravitational waves, long arm lengths of 300 m\nup to 4 km and circulating laser power in the order of 10 kW are going to be realized in 2003 with the help of the technique of\npower recycling [6].\nGEO 600 is the only first-generation detector that not only uses power recycling, but also includes the more advanced technique\nof signal recycling [7]. The idea of signal recycling is to retro-reflect part of the signal light at the dark port back into the\ninterferometer, establishing an additional cavity which can be set to resonate at a desired gravitational-wave frequency. Signal\nrecycling leads to a well known (optical) resonance structure in the interferometer's sensitivity curve. This resonance can already\nbeat the standard quantum limit (SQL) [8, 9], which is the upper bound for the sensitivity of conventional interferometers without\nsignal recycling and with conventional input and output optics. A further benefit of signal recycling is the reduced optical loss\ndue to imperfect mode matching from the mode healing effect [10]. The next-generation detectors currently being planned are\nlikely to use this technique, for example the Advanced LIGO (LIGO II) [11].\nBuonanno and Chen also predict a second, opto-mechanical resonance in signal-recycled interferometers, around which the\ninterferometer gains sensitivity, and can also beat the standard quantum limit [8, 9, 12, 13]. Their work has been limited to\nsignal-recycled interferometers with arm cavities, or interferometers with one single end mirror in each arm, and with infinitely\nheavy beamsplitters. In all cases considered, coherent vacuum was entering the interferometer's dark port, i.e. no additional\ninput and output optics were investigated. On the other hand, Kimble et al. investigated these additional input and output\noptics for the conventional LIGO detector topology without signal-recycling [14] building on earlier work on squeezed-input\ninterferometers [15, 16, 17, 18, 19] and variational-output interferometers [20, 21, 22, 23, 24].\nIn this paper, we investigate the benefit of squeezed light with frequency-dependent squeezing angle injected into the interferometer's dark port and also the benefit of frequency-dependent (variational) homodyne readout, using the two-photon\ninput-output formalism of quantum optics [25] . In sections III and IV of this paper we derive analytical expressions for the\noptimized frequency dependencies of squeezing angle and homodyning angle for optical-spring signal-recycled interferometers,\nrespectively. For definiteness, our results are presented using the Michelson topology of GEO 600. Unlike the LIGO, VIRGO\nand TAMA 300 interferometers, GEO 600 has folded arms and no arm cavities (Fig. 1). We plot and compare the spectral\ndensities of the quantum noise of the GEO 600 topology without and with additional input and output optics. Using the coupling\nparameter of Advanced LIGO, the results are readily applicable to the proposed LIGO topology.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nSIGNAL RECYCLING\n\nBy placing a mirror in the dark port of an interferometer a cavity between this so-called signal-recycling mirror and the two\nend mirrors of the interferometer is formed. The length of this cavity can be tuned independently and can be made resonant at\nsome signal frequency \u03a9. Thus the signal is recycled and amplified due to an increased interaction time. The original idea of\nthe signal-recycling (SR) topology, i.e. a mirror in the dark port, was due to Meers [7], who proposed its use for dual-recycling,\nwhich is the combination of power- and signal-recycling. Later, Mizuno et al. [26, 27] and Heinzel et al. [28, 29] proposed\nthe scheme of resonant sideband extraction, which uses a detuned signal-recycling mirror to extract the signal from high-finesse\narm cavities. Both schemes of tuned and detuned signal-recycling cavities have been experimentally demonstrated by Heinzel et\nal. [30] and Freise et al. [31] with the 30 m laser interferometer in Garching near Munich. Recently the GEO 600 interferometer\nin Ruthe near Hannover has been completed by the implementation of the signal-recycling mirror. Since GEO 600 has no FabryP\u00e9rot cavities (Fig. 1) the SR-mirror will be operated at or close to resonance. Relevant technical parameters of GEO 600 are\nsummerized in Table I.\n\nFIG. 1: GEO 600 is a dual-recycled Michelson interferometer implementing a power-recycling mirror in order to enhance the light power\nwithin the Michelson arms and a signal-recycling mirror in the dark port which is tuned on a specific signal frequency. Since the arms are\nfolded once, then the effective armlength is doubled to 1200 m.\n\nsymbol physical meaning\nm\nL\nP\n\u03c90\n\u03c1\n\u03c6\n\nmirror mass (each)\neffective arm length\ncirculating light power\nangular frequency of carrier light\npower reflectivity of SRM\nSR-cavity detuning\n\nnumerical value\n5.6 kg\n1200 m\n10 kW\n1.77 * 1015 s\u22121\n0.99\n0.0055 rad\n\nTABLE I: Technical data and parameter values of GEO 600 which where used to calculate the spectral noise densities in Figs. 2\u20134.\n\nWhereas it was well known that signal-recycled interferometers exhibit an optical resonance, Buonanno and Chen [8, 9] have\nrecently shown that SR-interferometers exhibit a second resonance, which is opto-mechanical. This resonance stems from the\nclassical opto-mechanical coupling of the light field with the anti-symmetric mode of the otherwise free mirrors [12]: in detuned\nsignal-recycling schemes, the phase-modulation sidebands induced by a gravitational wave are partly converted into amplitude\nmodulations, which beat with the carrier field, producing a motion-dependent force and acting back on the test masses. This\nclassical back-action force can be thought of as generated by an optical spring. The optical spring makes the test masses no\nlonger free, and can shift their resonant frequencies upwards into the detection band. The interferometer gains sensitivity on and\naround this resonance, and can beat the standard quantum limit [8, 9, 12]. Whereas the optical resonance is primarily determined\nby the detuning of the SR-cavity with respect to the carrier-frequency \u03c90 (Fig. 5.8 in [32]), the opto-mechanical resonance\nappears at a specific sideband frequency of the carrier light which depends on the interferometer's topology, the mirror masses\nm, the light-power P inside the interferometer and the detuning \u03c6 of the SR cavity from its resonance. The opto-mechanical\n\n\f3\ncoupling of the light field with the anti-symmetric mode of the interferometer also leads to the phenomenon of ponderomotive\nsqueezing [33], i.e. the amplitude and phase quantum noise become correlated. This quantum effect is automatically considered\nby the formalism revealing the optical-spring behaviour. However, as pointed out in [9], in SR interferometers the ponderomotive\nsqueezing only seems to be a secondary factor that enables the interferometer to beat the SQL, whereas the classical resonant\namplification of the signal provides the main factor.\nThe investigations led by Buonanno and Chen focused on the topology of the proposed Advanced LIGO configuration, which\nconsists of a dual-recycled Michelson-interferometer with a Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity in each arm. Due to the weak laser power at\nthe beamsplitter, the opto-mechanical coupling of the light with the beamsplitters free oscillation was neglected. In contrast,\nGEO 600 is a dual-recycled interferometer that builds up a high intensity field by means of a power-recycling (PR) mirror in the\nbright port of the interferometer. Therefore, the motion of the beamsplitter (BS) in GEO 600 is affected by power fluctuations\nof fields impinging from different directions. Nevertheless, assuming that the laser is shot-noise limited, the opto-mechanical\ncoupling at the beamsplitter exerts only minor changes on the noise spectrum of the output. It can intuitively be understood\nthat the quantum back-action noises associated with the arm mirrors, which have a reduced mass of 1/5 the actual mirror mass\ndue to folding the arms, clearly dominates the beamsplitter of mBS = 9.3 kg. Throughout this paper we do not consider the\neffect of radiation-pressure noise on the beamsplitter. This has also been studied but will be presented in detail elsewhere [34].\nHenceforth the term \"ideal GEO 600\" refers to the interferometer with opto-mechanical coupling of the beamsplitter neglected.\nThe optical noise in an interferometer can be expressed in terms of the (single-sided) noise spectral density Sh of the output\nfield normalized by the transfer function of the signal. The noise spectral density is obtained from the input-output relation,\nwhich maps the numerous input fields in and the gravitational-wave signal h = \u2206L/L onto the detected output field o. Here we\nnote that no additional noise due to the quantization of the test masses has to be considered. The sole forms of quantum noise\naffecting the output noise in interferometric gravitational wave detectors are the shot noise and the radiation pressure noise [35].\nThe following calculations are most easily accomplished in the Caves-Schumaker two-photon formalism [25], where the\noptical fields are decomposed into amplitude and phase quadratures, which can then be put together into a vector, e.g., for the\noutput field of the interferometer\n!\n\u00f41\n,\n(1)\no=\n\u00f42\nwhere \u00f41,2 are the output amplitude and phase quadratures. The input-output relation for a lossless SR interferometer can be\ncast into the following form:\no=\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nTi + s h .\nM\n\n(2)\n\nHere, T designates a 2 \u00d7 2-matrix.

In comparison, the noise spectral densities of both orthogonal quadratures of the signal-recycled GEO 600 output-field exhibit a doubly\nresonant structure which beats the standard quantum limit.\n\nfunctions s.

Its symmetrization becomes necessary, if a more general interferometer topology is considered with complex coupling constant K. The expression in Eq. (7) for the noise spectral density is\nvalid for any optical system whose transfer function can be given the form of Eq. (2).\nUsing Eq. (7) and the parameters and definitions in Table I and II we are now able to plot the linear noise spectral density of\nthe ideal GEO 600 topology for output quadrature fields of arbitrary values of the angle \u03b6. Fig. 2 shows the two spectral densities\nSh (\u03b6 = 0) and Sh (\u03b6 = \u03c02 ) compared with the SQL (straight solid line). It can be seen that for both quadrature angles the SQL is\nbeaten at frequencies around 30 Hz. This noise minimum is due to the opto-mechanical resonance (i.e. the optical-spring effect).\nThe second minimum at around 200 Hz corresponds to the optical resonance of the SR cavity. This resonance can also beat the\nSQL when higher reflectivities of the SR mirror \u03c1 are used. For further comparison, the quantum noise limit of a conventional\nGEO 600 without signal-recycling is also given (solid line in the upper part of Fig. 2). The dashed lines represent the two\ncontributions to this (conventional) limit, the uncorrelated white shot noise and the radiation-pressure noise (\u221d f \u22122 ). The limit\ngiven here is calculated for a circulating light power of P = 10 kW that reaches the SQL at 3 Hz and of course can never beat\nthe SQL. It is interesting to note that light powers of around 1 MW are needed to shift the conventional limit downwards to get\nstandard quantum noise limited sensitivity at around 100 Hz (not shown in Fig. 2).\nIn the next two sections we investigate how the sub-SQL spectral noise densities of signal-recycled gravitational wave detectors can be further improved by squeezed light injected into the dark port of the interferometer and by a frequency dependent\nread-out scheme.\nIII.

The array of thin black curves evolves from the dashed curve, if the input vacuum-field at the dark port is squeezed with squeezing\nparameter r = 1 and the squeezing angle \u03bb is varied in a frequency independent manner. The array is bounded from below by the lower bold\nblack curve. Alternatively, one obtains the lower boundary, if the conventional SR noise spectral density is simply shifted downwards by a\nfactor of e\u2212r . The same holds for the amplitude quadrature. The straight line represents the standard quantum-limit.\n\nAs first proposed by Caves [15], squeezed light can be employed to reduce the high power requirements in GW interferometers.\nLater Unruh [16] and others [14, 17, 18, 19] have found and proven in different ways that squeezed light with a frequency\ndependent orientation of the squeezing ellipse can reduce the quantum noise down to values beyond the standard quantum\nlimit.This research was done on interferometer topologies without signal-recycling. Chickarmane et al. [36, 37] investigated the\nsqueezed-input signal-recycled interferometer at low laser powers, i.e. the shot-noise limited case. In this section we consider\nthe squeezed-input signal-recycled interferometer at high laser powers including the effect of back-action noise.\nAs discussed in Sec. IVB of Ref. [14], squeezed vacuum is related to the ordinary coherent vacuum state by an unitary operator\n|ini = S(r, \u03bb)|0i ,\n\n(9)\n\n\f6\nwhere r is the squeezing parameter, and \u03bb the squeezing angle (for an introduction to squeezed light see for example [38]).\nAlternatively, we can transform the input state back to the vacuum state, by\n|ini \u2192 S \u2020 (r, \u03bb)|ini = |0i ,\n\n(10)\n\nand at the same time transform the input quadrature operators accordingly [Eq. (A8) of Ref. [14]],\ni \u2192 S \u2020 (r, \u03bb) i S(r, \u03bb)\n= D(\u2212\u03bb)S(r)D(\u03bb)i ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\nD(\u03bb) \u2261\n\ncos \u03bb sin \u03bb\n\u2212 sin \u03bb cos \u03bb\n\n!\n\n,\n\ner\n0\n0 e\u2212r\n\nS(r) \u2261\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nFrom Eq. (11), we also see that a squeezed vacuum with squeezing angle \u03bb can be obtained from a second-quadrature squeezing\nby applying a rotation of D(\u2212\u03bb) (note the minus sign). Any further rotation of quadratures will also add (with a minus sign) to\nthe squeezing angle.\nThe input-output relation of the lossless interferometer with fixed beamsplitter becomes\no=\nimplying a noise spectral density of\n\nSh =\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\nT D(\u2212\u03bb)S(r)D(\u03bb)i + s h ,\nM\n\ncos \u03b6 sin \u03b6\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nTD(\u2212\u03bb)S(2r)D(\u03bb)T\u2020\n\ncos \u03b6 sin \u03b6\n\n\u0011\n\nss\n\ncos \u03b6\nsin \u03b6\n\n\u2020\n\n(13)\n\ncos \u03b6\nsin \u03b6\n\n!\n\n!\n\n(14)\n\nNote that here T is a real matrix with an overall phase factor in front (cf. Eq. (3)). Fig. 3 shows an array consisting of 7\ncurves (thin lines) where the quadrature angle \u03b6 = \u03c0/2 is constant and the frequency independent squeezing angle \u03bb is varied.\nIn all cases the squeezing parameter r has been set to unity. Interestingly a variation of the frequency-independent squeezing\nangle causes a frequency shift of both resonances. For comparison, the standard quantum limit (straight line) and the spectral\nnoise density in the quadrature at \u03b6 = \u03c0/2 without squeezed input is also given (dashed line). As we can see, each individual frequency-independent value for \u03bb can be advantageous to the case without squeezing only in a certain frequency band.\nObviously, the envelope of the minima of the squeezed input array, as also drawn in the graph (lower bold line), is physically\nmeaningful since it can in principle be realized by applying squeezed light with a squeezing angle optimized for each side-band\nfrequency. Such light is called frequency-dependent squeezed light and yields a broad-band improvement in the quantum noise\nlimited sensitivity. In the final paragraphs of this section we now derive an analytical expression for the optimized spectral noise\ndensity. Suppose now the squeezing angle \u03bb can be an arbitrary function of frequency, and r is always positive, then as we can\ntell from Eq. (14), the optimal \u03bb(\u03a9) should make\n!\n!\ncos \u03b6\n0\n\u2020\nD(\u03bb(\u03a9))T\n\u221d\n,\n(15)\nsin \u03b6\n1\nor\ntan \u03bb(\u03a9) = \u2212\n\nT11 cos \u03b6 + T21 sin \u03b6\n;\nT12 cos \u03b6 + T22 sin \u03b6\n\n(16)\n\nyielding an optimal noise spectrum of\n\nShSI\n\n=e\n\n\u22122r\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\ncos \u03b6 sin \u03b6\n\n\u0011\n\ncos \u03b6 sin \u03b6\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2020\n\nTT\nss\n\n\u2020\n\ncos \u03b6\nsin \u03b6\ncos \u03b6\nsin \u03b6\n\n!\n\n! .\n\n(17)\n\n\f7\nThis expression turns out to be identical to the noise spectral density without squeezing in Eq. (7) being suppressed by a factor\nof e\u22122r . This result can be understood intuitively as follows. The input quadrature field is going to be rotated (and possibly\nponderomotively squeezed) by the matrix T before being detected. The minimal noise quadrature of the squeezed state should\ntherefore be rotated conversely before being injected into the interferometer, such that the detector always \"sees\" the minimal\nnoise.\nSqueezed vacuum can be generated with a variable but frequency-independent squeezing angle \u03bb (see for example [39]). A\nfrequency-dependent squeezing angle can be obtained subsequently by filtering the initial squeezed light through detuned FabryP\u00e9rot (FP) cavities, as proposed by Kimble et al. [14], which can rotate the quadratures in a frequency dependent way. For small\nfrequencies (\u03a9 \u226a c/LFP ), a detuned FP cavity of length LFP rotates the reflected quadrature in the following way:\naout = ei\u03b1m D(\u2212\u03b1p )ain\n\n(18)\n\nwith\n\u03b1p,m =\n\n1\n(\u03b1+ \u00b1 \u03b1\u2212 )\n2\n\n(19)\n\nand\n\u03b1\u00b1 = 2 arctan(\u03be \u00b1 \u03a9/\u03b4).\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03be is defined by the resonant frequency \u03c9FP and by \u03b4 which is the half-linewidth of the cavity: \u03c9FP = \u03c90 \u2212 \u03be\u03b4. As further\nshown by Purdue and Chen in Appendix A of Ref. [40], several such Fabry-P\u00e9rot filter cavities can be combined to give a broad\ncategory of frequency dependent rotation angles. Adopting their formulas [cf. Eqs. (A.8)-(A.14)] into our context, we found\nthat, in order to realize an additional squeezing angle \u03bb(\u03a9) with the form of\nPn\nBk \u03a92k\ntan \u03bb(\u03a9) = Pnk=0\n, |An + i Bn | > 0 .\n(21)\n2k\nk=0 Ak \u03a9\nwe first need to obtain an initial frequency independent squeezed state with\n\n\u03bb0 = arg(An \u2212 i Bn ) ,\n\n(22)\n\nand then filter this squeezed light with n filters whose complex resonant frequencies differ from \u03c90 by \u03a9res\nJ \u2261 \u2212\u03b4J \u03beJ \u2212 i \u03b4J ,\nJ = 1, 2, . . . , n, with {\u00b1\u03a9res\nJ } being the 2n roots of the characteristic equation:\nn\nX\n\nk=0\n\n(Ak \u2212 i Bk )\u03a92k = 0 .\n\n(23)\n\n[Note that {\u03a9res\nJ } are the n roots with the appropriate sign of imaginary part, in our case negative.]\nSuppose the readout quadrature \u03b6 is frequency independent, from the ideal input-output relation of GEO 600, we see that the\ndesired \u03bb from Eq. (16) is indeed of the form of Eq. (21) when \u03a9L/c is expanded to the leading order [43]. Two filter cavities\nare necessary for the generic case. However, as we look at the low-power limit, only one such filter is necessary. In this case,\nthe input-output relation rotates the input quadratures into the output quadratures following the same law as a detuned cavity.\nNaturally, as we go through Eqs. (22) and (23), we find that the required initial additional squeezing angle is\n\u03bb0 = \u03b6 \u2212 \u03c0/2 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhich puts the minor axis of the noise ellipse onto the \u03b6 quadrature, while the required cavity has resonant frequency\n\u03a9filter res =\n\nc\u03c4 2\n\u03c6FP c\n\u2212 i FP ,\nLFP\n4LFP\n\n(25)\n\nwhich is just \"opposite\" to the signal-recycling resonant frequency,\n\u03a9SR res \u2261 \u03c9 SR \u2212 i \u03b3 SR = \u2212\n\n\u03c6c\nc\u03c4 2\n\u2212i\n,\nL\n4L\n\n(26)\n\nand cancels the rotation induced by signal-recycling.\nFor full-power GEO 600 interferometers, the initial additional squeezing angle is still given by Eq. (24), while the frequencydependent part requires two cavities determined by the following characteristic equation:\n\u03a92 (\u03a9 + \u03c9 SR + i \u03b3 SR )(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9 SR \u2212 i \u03b3 SR ) \u2212\n\n10P \u03c90 SR\n(\u03c9 + 2ei\u03b6 sin(\u03b6)\u03b3 SR ) = 0 .\nmM Lc\n\n(27)\n\nIt is straightforward to solve for the four roots (in two pairs) of the characteristic equations. The corresponding transmissivity \u03c4\nof the input mirror and the detuning \u03c6 of the filter cavity can be derived from these roots by virtue of Eq. (25).\n\n\f8\nIV. SIGNAL RECYCLING, SQUEEZED LIGHT INPUT AND VARIATIONAL OUTPUT\n\nAs shown by Kimble et al. [14], the quantum noise spectral density of a conventional interferometer without signal-recycling\ncan benefit simultaneously from both, frequency-dependent squeezed light input and frequency-dependent homodyne read-out.\nIn this section we investigate the optical-spring signal-recycled interferometer with corresponding additional input and output\noptics. We start from the result of the previous section and vary the angle \u03b6 of homodyne detection.\n\u221221\n\nLinear spectral noise density [1/\u221aHz]\n\n10\n\n\u221222\n\n10\n\n\u221223\n\n10\n\n10\n\n100\nFrequency [Hz]\n\nFIG. 4: Another improvement of the SR-densities is achieved, if the detection angle is optimized for each signal frequency. Since the shot\nnoise and radiation-pressure noise are highly correlated especially in the detection band, the effect is less beneficial than the optimization of the\ninput squeezing angle. However, comparing the boundary curve with the dashed curve which corresponds to an arbitrary but fixed detection\nangle, the bandwidth of the noise minima is enhanced and a noise reduction by a factor of 10 can be achieved at some frequencies.\n\nFig. 4 shows an array of noise spectral densities of the output quadrature with varying detection angle \u03b6 which is here still\nfrequency independent. The input vacuum at the dark port is optimally squeezed with squeezing parameter r = 1. Obviously, the\narray is bounded from below. This boundary corresponds to the optimized quantum noise spectral density of the signal-recycled\ninterferometer. One member of the array is highlighted by a bold dashed line. Comparing the dashed curve with the optimized\nnoise spectral density, one can see that the variational output provides a further improvement of the interferometer's performance\nwhich is mainly an increased bandwidth of the sub-SQL sensitivity. At some frequencies the noise is reduced by a factor of 10.\nWe emphasize that the optimized noise spectrum presented can not be further improved for this interferometer topology without\nincreasing the squeezing parameter r of the input vacuum. Obviously, our results are also significant without any squeezing of\nthe input vacuum. The plots in Fig. 4 are not altered except for a shift upwards by a factor of er .\nIn the final part of this section we give an analytical expression of the lower boundary starting from Eq. (17). ShSI has to be\nminimized with respect to the detection angle \u03b6. One method to find the minimum noise is to determine analytically the minimum\nof the function ShSI (\u03b6). Then, a lengthy but straightforward calculation leads to a conditional equation for the optimized detection\nangle \u03b6opt of the following form [44]:\n!\n!\n\u0010\n\u0011\ncos \u03b6opt\nQ11 Q12\n= 0.\n(28)\ncos \u03b6opt sin \u03b6opt\nsin \u03b6opt\nQ12 Q22\nRepresenting a general SR interferometer, the coefficients of the symmetric quadric Q are complex (and complex-valued) functions of the interferometers' parameters (K, \u03a6, . . .) which determine the input-output relation Eq. (2). It is more convenient to\nexpress them in terms of the elements of the two symmetrized matrices S = s s\u2020 sym , T = T T\u2020 sym :\nQ11 = S11 (T12 + T21 ) \u2212 T11 (S12 + S21 ),\nQ12 = S11 T22 \u2212 T11 S22 ,\n\n(29)\n\nQ22 = T22 (S12 + S21 ) \u2212 S22 (T12 + T21 ).\nIn general, Eq. (28) has two solutions corresponding to a local minimum and a local maximum of the noise density:\n\u0014\n\u0011\u0015\n1 \u0010 p\n\u00b1 \u2212 det Q + Q12 .\n\u03b6\u00b1 = \u2212arccot\nQ11\n\n(30)\n\n\f9\n250\n\nangle in deg\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n\u03b6opt(\u03bd)\u2212detection\n\u03bb (\u03bd)\u2212squeezing\nopt\n\n0\n10\n\n100\nFrequency in Hz\n\nFIG. 5: The optimized detection angle \u03b6opt is determined by Eq. (30). The optimized squeezing angle \u03bbopt of the input field depends on \u03b6opt\nby virtue of Eq. (16).\n\nThe minimum of the noise spectral density is given by inserting \u03b6opt = \u03b6\u2212 into Eq. (17). The optimized detection angle \u03b6opt\nis shown in Fig. 5 together with the optimized squeezing angle \u03bbopt of the input field which depends on \u03b6opt according to\nEq. (16). The form of both curves suggests that the filtering of the input and output light is accomplishable. Due to the frequency\ndependence of the squeezing and detection angle, one has to investigate first if an expansion in the form of Eq. (21) yields an\nexpression which represents a manageable number of filter cavities. Furthermore, both spectra in Fig. 5 are sensitive to small\nchanges of the parameters. Therefore, we do not propose a specific number of filter cavities needed to realize the frequency\ndependence.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have shown that the quantum-noise limited sensitivity of signal-recycled interferometers, like GEO 600 or LIGO II,\ncan be improved by additional input and output optics. Although an optical-spring signal-recycled interferometer can already\nbeat the standard quantum limit and ponderomotively generates squeezed light our results show that squeezed light input is\ncompatible leading to a quantum noise reduction by the squeezing factor e\u22122r (in power). Variational output optics was proven\nto provide an additional benefit to the quantum noise limited sensitivity of signal-recycled interferometers. Our work augments\nthe results by Buonanno and Chen [8, 9, 12, 13] and by Kimble et al. [14] and synthesizes their investigations.\nWe have provided fully optimized homodyning and squeezing angles, expressible in analytical formulas, although they are\nprobably not easily achievable using the technique proposed by Kimble et al., which uses detuned FP cavities as optical\nfilters. However, in the special (sub-optimal) case with frequency-independent homodyning angle but frequency-dependent\ninput squeezing angle, we found the optimal (frequency-dependent) input squeezing angle to be achievable by applying two\nsubsequent filters on a frequency-independent squeezed light. We did not analyze the effect of optical losses, but as pointed out\nby Kimble et al., the frequency-dependent input squeezing technique is less susceptible to optical losses than the variational\nreadout and squeezed-variational schemes. A thorough study of optical losses will be published in a separate paper [34].\nWe acknowledge A. Freise, H. L\u00fcck, G. Heinzel and B.
