We find that the band lineup in the nanotube bulk region is determined by the\neffective work function difference between the nanotube channel and source/drain electrodes, while\nelectron transmission through the SWNT junction is affected by the local band structure modulation at the two metal-nanotube interfaces, leading to an effective decoupling of interface and bulk\neffects in electron transport through nanotube junction devices.\nPACS numbers: 73.63.-b,73.40.-c,85.65.+h\n\nDevices based on single-wall carbon nanotubes\n(SWNTs)1,2 have been progressing in a fast pace, e.g.,\nthe performance of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (NTFET) is approaching that of the state-of-theart silicon Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET).3,4,5 But a general consensus on the\nphysical mechanisms and theoretical models remains to\nappear. A point of continuing controversy in NTFET has\nbeen the effect of Schottky barriers at the metal-SWNT\ninterface.6,7 Since SWNTs are atomic-scale nanostructures in both the axial and the circumferential dimensions, any barrier that may form at the interface has a\nfinite thickness and a finite width.3,8,9 In general a microscopic treatment of both the source/drain and gate field\nmodulation effect will be needed to account for faithfully\nthe atomistic nature of the electronic processes in NTFET.\nSince the characteristics of the NTFETs depend sensitively on the gate geometry,3 a thorough understanding\nof the Schottky barrier effect in the simpler two-terminal\nmetal-SWNT-metal junction devices is essential in elucidating the switching effect caused by applying a finite\ngate voltage.8 As a basic device building block, the twoterminal device is also of interests for applications in\nelectromechanical and electrochemical sensors, where the\nconduction properties of the SWNT junctions are modulated by mechanical strain10 or molecular adsorption respectively.11 Previous works have considered symmetric\nSWNT junctions with different contact geometries.8 Here\nwe consider SWNT in contact with metallic electrodes of\ndifferent work functions. Such hetero-metallic junctions\nare of interests since: (1) The electrode work function\ndifference leads to a contact potential and finite electric\nfield (built-in field) across the junction at equilibrium.\nA self-consistent analysis of the hetero-metallic junction\ncan shed light on the screening of the applied field by\nthe SWNT channel and the corresponding band bending\neffect even at zero bias; (2) For SWNTs not intentionally doped, electron and hole doping can be induced si-\n\nmultaneously inside the channel by contacting with high\nand low work function metals; (3) Since the metallurgy\nof the metal-SWNT contact is different at the two interfaces, the asymmetric device structure may facilitate\nseparating interface effect on electron transport from the\nintrinsic property of the SWNT channel.\nThe hetero-metallic SWNT junction is shown schematically in Fig. 1, where the ends of an infinitely long\nSWNT wire are buried inside two semi-infinite metallic electrodes with different work functions. The embedded contact scheme is favorable for the formation of\nlow-resistance contact. For simplicity, we assume the\nembedded parts of the SWNT are surrounded entirely\nby the metals with overall cylindrical symmetry around\nthe SWNT axis.12 For comparison with previous work\non symmetric SWNT junctions, we investigate (10, 0)\nSWNTs (with work function of 4.5 eV1 ) in contact with\ngold (Au) and titanium (Ti) electrodes (with work functions of 5.1 and 4.33 eV respectively for polycrystalline\nmaterials13 ). Choosing the electrostatic potential energy\nin the middle of the junction and far away from the cylindrical surface of the SWNT as the energy reference, the\nFermi-level of the Au-SWNT-Ti junction is the negative of the average metal work functions EF = \u22124.715\neV. The SWNT channel length investigated ranges from\nL = 2.0, 4.1, 8.4, 12.6, 16.9 nm to 21.2 nm, corresponding\nto number of unit cells of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 respectively. We calculate the transport characteristics within\nthe coherent transport regime, as appropriate for such\nshort nanotubes.14\nUsing a Green's function based self-consistent tightbinding (SCTB) theory, we analyze the Schottky barrier effect by examining the electrostatics, the band\nlineup and the transport characteristics of the heterometallic SWNT junction as a function of the SWNT\nchannel length. The SCTB model is essentially the\nsemi-empirical implementation of the self-consistent Matrix Green's function method for ab initio modeling of\nmolecular-scale devices,15 which takes fully into account\n\n\f2\ntransfer induced electrostatic potential change \u03b4V decays\nrapidly in the direction perpendicular to the SWNT axis.\nThis has led to a different physical picture of band bending in symmetric SWNT junctions.8 In particular, the\nband lineup inside the SWNT channel has been found to\ndepend mainly on the metal work function, while interaction across the metal-SWNT interface modulates the\nband structure close to the interface without affecting the\nband lineup scheme in the middle of the channel. Similar physical picture applies to the hetero-metallic SWNT\njunction, where we find that the band lineup in the middle of the Au-SWNT-Ti\njunction is essentially identical\nR\n+\n\u22121\nG = {(E + i0 )S \u2212 H \u2212 \u03a3L (E) \u2212 \u03a3L;N T (E) \u2212 \u03a3R (E) \u2212 \u03a3toR;N\n(1),SWNT junction with symmetric contact to\nT (E)}\nthat\nof the\nZ\ndE\nmetals with(2)\nwork function of 4.715 eV.

Since in the case of voltage dropping mostly\nacross the interface, the transmission coefficient is approximately voltage-independent at low-bias,22 here we\ncalculate the I-V characteristics using the equilibrium\ntransmission coefficient instead of the full self-consistent\ncalculation at each bias voltage. We find that the conductance of the Au-SWNT-Ti junction shows a transition from tunneling-dominated to thermal activationdominated regime with increasing channel length, but the\nlength where this occurs is longer than those of the symmetric Au/Ti-SWNT-Au/Ti junctions (Fig. 5(a)). This\nis partly due to the fact that the Fermi-level is closer to\nthe mid-gap of the SWNT band inside the channel, partly\n\n*\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\nAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Due to the finite number of conduction channels, the increase of the conductance with temperature is rather slow (Fig. 5(b)).8 The\nrelative contribution of tunneling and thermal-activation\nto the room-temperature I-V characteristics is shown in\nFigs. 5(c) and 5(d) for the 20- and 40-unit cell long\n(8.4 and 16.9 nm) SWNT respectively, where we see that\nthermal-activation contribution increases rapidly with\nbias voltage for the 20-unit cell SWNT junction while the\nthermal-activation contribution dominates the I-V characteristics at all bias voltages for the 40-unit cell SWNT.\nIn conclusion, we have presented an atomistic realspace analysis of Schottky barrier effect in the twoterminal SWNT junction with hetero-metallic contacts,\nwhich shows an effective decoupling of interface and bulk\neffects. Further analysis is needed that treat both the\ngate and source/drain fields self-consistently in the real\nspace to achieve a thorough understanding of NTFETs.\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\nMcEuen P L 2003 Phys.

Lett. 90\n257403\nExperimentally low-resistance contacts can be obtained either by growing SWNT's directly out of the predefined catalyst islands and subsequently covering the catalyst islands\nwith metallic contact pads (Ref. 4) or by using standard\nlithography and lift-off techniques with subsequent annealing at high-temperature (Ref. 7). In both cases, the ends\nof the long SWNT wires are surrounded entirely by the\nmetals with strong metal-SWNT surface chemical bonding,\nalthough the exact atomic structure of the metal-SWNT\ninterface remains unclear. Contacts can also be formed by\ndepositing SWNT on top of the predefined metallic electrodes and side-contacted to the surfaces of the metals\n(side-contact scheme), which corresponds to the weak coupling limit due to the weak van der Waals bonding in the\nside-contact geometry leading to high contact resistance\n(Ref. 3). Other types of contact may also exist corresponding to intermediate coupling strength. The contact geometry chosen in this work thus serves as a simplified model\nof the low-resistance contact. A comprehensive study of\nthe contact effects in SWNT junction devices is currently\nunder way and will be reported in a future publication.\n1994 CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (CRC\n\n\f4\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\nPress, Boca Raton)\nYao Z, Kane C L and Dekker C 2000 Phys.
