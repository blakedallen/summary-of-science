This\nmysterious component, that violates the strong energy\ncondition (SEC), drives a present accelerated stage of\nthe cosmic evolution and is called \"dark energy\" (DE).\nA pleiad of models have been investigated to account for\nthis SEC violating source of gravity. Among them, one\nof the most successful models is a slowly varying scalar\nfield, called 'quintessence'[1, 2].\nMany models of quintessence assume that the background and the dark energy evolve independently, so\ntheir natural generalization are models with non-minimal\ncoupling between both components. Although experimental tests in the solar system impose severe restrictions on the possibility of non-minimal coupling between\nthe DE and ordinary matter fluids [3], due to the unknown nature of the dark matter (DM), it is possible\nto have additional (non gravitational) interactions between the DE and the DM components, without conflict\nwith the experimental data.1 Since, models with nonminimal coupling imply interaction (exchange of energy)\namong the DM and the DE, these models provide new\nqualitative features for the coincidence problem [5, 6]. It\nhas been shown, in particular, that a suitable coupling,\ncan produce scaling solutions that are free of the coincidence. The way in which the coupling is approached is\nnot unique. In reference [5], for instance, the coupling\nis introduced by hand. In [6] the type of coupling is not\nspecified from the beginning. Instead, the form of the interaction term is fixed by the requirement that the ratio\n\n1\n\nIt should be pointed out, however, that when the stability of\ndark energy potentials in quintessence models is considered, the\ncoupling dark matter-dark energy is troublesome [4].\n\nof the energy densities of DM and quintessence had a stable (non-zero) equilibrium point that solves the problem\nof the coincidence. In [7], a suitable interaction between\nthe quintessence field and DM leads to a transition from\nthe matter domination era to an accelerated expansion\nepoch in the model of Ref.[6]. A model derived from\nthe Dilaton is studied in [8]. In this model the coupling\nfunction is chosen as a Fourier expansion around some\nminimum of the scalar field.\nA variety of self-interaction potentials have been studied in DE models to account for the desired evolution that\nfits the observational evidence. Among them, a single\nexponential is the simplest case. This type of potential\nleads to two possible late-time attractors in the presence\nof a barotropic fluid[9, 10]: i) a scaling regime where the\nscalar field mimics the dynamics of the background fluid,\ni. e., the ratio between both DM and quintessence energy\ndensities is a constant and ii) an attractor solution dominated by the scalar field. Given that single exponential\npotentials can lead to one of the above scaling solutions,\nthen it should follow that a combination of exponentials\nshould allow for a scenario where the universe can evolve\nthrough a radiation-matter regime (attractor i)) and, at\nsome recent epoch, evolve into the scalar field dominated\nregime (attractor ii)). Models with single and double exponential potentials has been studied also in references\n[11, 12].\nAim of the present paper is to investigate models with\nnon-minimal coupling among the components of the cosmic fluid: the dust dark matter and the quintessence\nfield (a scalar field model of dark energy). To specify\nthe kind of coupling, we take as a Lagrangian model,\na scalar-tensor (ST) theory with Lagrangian written in\nEinstein frame variables. Otherwise, one might also consider the Lagrangian with additional non-gravitational\ncoupling between the matter species as an effective theory.\nIn this paper, to derive solutions of the field equations\nof the model, we use an ansatz that makes possible easy\nhandling of the differential equations involved at the cost,\n\n\f2\nhowever, of loosing the possibility to avoid the coincidence problem through an appropriate choice of the interaction between the DM and the DE (quintessence field).\nActually, we impose the dynamics of the expansion by exploring a linear relationship between the Hubble parameter and the time derivative of the scalar field.2 Using\nthis relationship we can solve the field equations explicitly. However, as it will be shown, unlike other models\nwhere the coincidence problem is solved (or smoothed\nout) through the choice of an appropriated interaction\nbetween the DM and the quintessence field, in the present\ninvestigation, solutions where the ratio between the dark\nmatter and the quintessence energy densities is a constant\n\u223c 1 (it is the necessary requirement to avoid the coincidence problem), are unstable so that the coincidence do\narises.\nHere we consider a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n(FRW) universe filled with a mixture of two interacting\nfluids: a background of DM and the quintessence field.\nSince there are suggestive arguments showing that observational bounds on the \"fifth\" force do not necessarily imply decoupling of baryons from quintessence[13],\nthen baryons are to be considered also as part of the\nbackground DM interacting with the quintessence field.\nIn other words, like in reference [13] we are considering\nuniversal coupling of the quintessence field to all sorts\nof matter (radiation is excluded). Since the arguments\ngiven in the appendix of reference [13] to explain this possibility are also applicable in the cases of interest in the\npresent study, we refer the interested reader to that reference to look for the details. However we want to mention\nthe basic arguments given therein: A possible explanation is through the \"longitudinal coupling\" approach to\ninhomogeneous perturbations of the model. The longitudinal coupling involves energy transfer between matter\nand quintessence with no momentum transfer to matter,\nso that no anomalous acceleration arises. In consequence,\nthis choice is not affected by observational bounds on\n\"fifth\" force exerted on the baryons. Other generalizations of the given approach could be considered that do\ninvolve an anomalous acceleration of the background due\nto its coupling to quintessence. However, due to the universal nature of the coupling, it could not be detected by\ndifferential acceleration experiments. Another argument\ngiven in [13] is that, since the coupling chosen is of phenomenological nature and its validity is restricted to cosmological scales (it depends on magnitudes that are only\nwell defined in that setting), the form of the coupling at\nsmaller scales remains unspecified. The requirements for\nthe different couplings that could have a manifestation\nat these scales are that a) they give the same averaged\ncoupling at cosmological scales, and b) they meet the\n\n2\n\nThis relationship is the simplest possible and, in the absence\nof any other information is, in a sense, the most natural since\nthe Hubble parameter fixes the time scale. This argument was\nsuggested to us by Diego Pavon.\n\nobservational bounds from the local experiments. We\ncomplete these arguments by noting that they are applicable even if the coupling is not of phenomenological\norigin, like in the present investigation where the kind of\ncoupling chosen is originated in a scalar-tensor theory of\ngravity.\nThe paper has been organized as follow. In section\nII the details of the model are given. The method used\nto derive FRW solutions is explained in section III. We\nuse the 'two fluids' approach: a background fluid of DM\nand a self-interacting scalar field (quintessence). Specific exponential couplings with different exponents, that\nare inspired in ST theory and lead, correspondingly, to\nself-interaction potentials of single exponential and double exponential class, are studied separately. In section\nIV a study of existence and stability of the solutions is\npresented. We point out that, due to the choice of the\nsolution generating ansatz, the coincidence problem can\nnot be evaded since, a constant ratio between the energy densities of the components of the cosmic mixture\nis never a stable attractor. In section V, conclusions are\ngiven.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nWe consider the following action that is inspired in a\nscalar-tensor theory written in the Einstein frame, where\nthe quintessence (scalar) field is coupled to the matter\ndegrees of freedom:\n\nS=\n\nZ\n\np\n1\n1\nd4 x |g|{ R \u2212 (\u2207\u03c6)2 \u2212 V (\u03c6)\n2\n2\nM4\n\n+C 2 (\u03c6)L(matter) }.\n\n(1)\n\nIn this equation R is the curvature scalar, \u03c6 is the\nscalar (quintessence) field, V (\u03c6) - the quintessence selfinteraction potential, C 2 (\u03c6) - the quintessence-matter\ncoupling function, and Lmatter is the Lagrangian density\nfor the matter degrees of freedom. This action could be\nconsidered, instead, as an effective theory, implying additional non-gravitational interaction between the components of the cosmic fluid.\nAlthough in the present study we will be concerned\nmainly with FRW spacetimes with flat spatial sections,\nhere for generality we write the FRW line element in the\nform:\ndr2\n+ r2 d\u03a92 ),\n1 \u2212 kr2\nd\u03a92 \u2261 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a(t)2 (\n\n(2)\n\nwhere t is the cosmic time, r, \u03b8, \u03c6 are the spatial (radial\nand angular) coordinates and k is the spatial curvature,\nwhich we take to be zero in this investigation. We use\nthe system of units in which 8\u03c0G = c = ~ = 1.\n\n\f3\nThe spacetime is filled with a background pressureless dark matter fluid and a quintessence field (the scalar\nfield \u03c6). As already said the baryons (a subdominant\ncomponent at present, but important in the past of the\ncosmic evolution) are included in the background of dark\nmatter. In the introductory part of this paper we have\nalready commented on the possibility of a universal coupling of the dark energy to all sorts of matter, including\nthe baryons (and excluding radiation).\nThe field equations that are derived from the action\n(1) are:\n1\n3k\n= \u03c1m + \u03c6\u03072 + V ,\n2\na\n2\nk\n1\n2\n2\u1e22 + 3H + 2 = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c1m \u2212 \u03c6\u03072 + V ,\na\n2\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 = \u2212V \u2032 + (ln X)\u2032 \u03c1m ,\n3H 2 +\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n(6)\n\nor, after integration\n\u03c1m = M a\u22123\u03b3 X \u22121 .\n\n(7)\n\nwhere M is a constant of integration. In the former equations the dot accounts for derivative in respect to the\nco-moving time t, while the prime denotes derivative in\nrespect to \u03c6. We now proceed to derive exact solutions\nto the above field equations by fixing the dynamics of the\nexpansion.\n\nIII.\n\nDERIVING SOLUTIONS\n\nIn order to derive exact analytic (flat; k = 0) solutions,\none should either fix the dynamics of the cosmic evolution\nor fix the functional form of the self-interaction potential\nV (\u03c6). In the present study we fix the dynamics of the\nmodel by imposing the following constraint\n\u03c6\u0307 = \u03bbH,\n\na = e\u03c6/\u03bb ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the scale factor has been normalized so that the\nintegration constant has been absorbed into it. After\nthis, the equation (7) can be rewritten in the following\nform:\n3\u03b3\n\n\u03c1m (\u03c6) = M e\u2212 \u03bb \u03c6 X \u22121 (\u03c6).\n\n(10)\n\nIf one adds up equations (3) and (4) then one obtains:\n\n(5)\n\nwhere we have introduced the reduced notation X(\u03c6) \u2261\nC(\u03c6)(3\u03b3\u22124)/2 . The parameter \u03b3 is the barotropic index\nof the background fluid (DM). The \"continuity\" equation\nfor the background is:\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3\u03b3H\u03c1m = \u2212(ln X)\u2032 \u03c6\u0307 \u03c1m ,\n\ncorresponding differential equation. As it will be shown,\nexponential coupling functions with different exponents\nrepresent the simplest situations to study in the present\nmodel. Correspondingly, the ansatz (8) implies that only\nself-interaction potentials of the exponential form (including their combination) can be considered. Integration of equation (8) implies that\n\n\u1e22 + 3H 2 =\n\n2\u2212\u03b3\n\u03c1m + V.\n2\n\n(11)\n\nSubstituting (8) in (5), and comparing the resulting equation with (11), a differential equation relating V and the\ncoupling function X (and their derivatives in respect to\nthe scalar field variable \u03c6) can be obtained:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bb(\u03b3 \u2212 2)\nd ln X\ndV\n. (12)\n+ \u03bbV (\u03c6) = \u03c1m (\u03c6)\n\u2212\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c6\n2\nConsider further equation (8) written in the form d\u03c6 =\n\u03bbd(ln a). It is then worthwhile rewriting of the equation\n(12) in the following form:\nV \u2032 + \u03bb2 V =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bb(\u03b3 \u2212 2)\nX\u2032\n\u2212\nX\n2\n\n\u0013\n\nM \u22121\nX ,\na3\u03b3\n\n(13)\n\nwhere now the prime denotes derivative in respect to the\nvariable N = ln a and we have substituted \u03c1m (\u03c6) from\nequation (10). Equation (3) can then be integrated in\nquadratures:\nd\u03c6\n\nZ\n\nq\n=\n3\u03b3\nM e\u2212 \u03bb \u03c6 X \u22121 (\u03c6) + V (\u03c6)\n\nr\n\n2\u03bb2\n(t + t0 ), (14)\n6 \u2212 \u03bb2\n\nor, if one introduces the time variable d\u03c4\n3\u03b3\ne\u2212 2\u03bb \u03c6 X \u22121/2 dt,\n\n=\n\n(8)\n\nthat involves the Hubble parameter and the square root\nof the kinetic energy of the quintessence field (\u03bb is an\narbitrary constant parameter). As it will be immediately\nshown, this relationship enables one to reduce the system of differential equations (3-5) to a single first order\ndifferential equation, involving the self-interaction potential V together with its derivative in respect to the scalar\nfield variable \u03c6 and the corresponding derivative of the\ncoupling function. Therefore if one chooses further the\nform of the coupling function, the functional form of the\nself-interaction potential can be found by solving of the\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\nq\n=\n3\u03b3\nM + e \u03bb \u03c6 X(\u03c6)V (\u03c6)\n\nr\n\n2\u03bb2\n(\u03c4 + \u03c40 ). (15)\n6 \u2212 \u03bb2\n\nIn consequence, once the function X(\u03c6) (or X(a)) is\ngiven as input, then one can solve equation (12) (or (13))\nto find the functional form of the potential V (\u03c6) (or\nV (a)). The integral (14) (or (15)) can then be taken\nexplicitly to obtain t = t(\u03c6) (or \u03c4 = \u03c4 (\u03c6)). By inversion\nwe can obtain \u03c6 = \u03c6(t) (or \u03c6 = \u03c6(\u03c4 )) so, the scale factor\ncan be given as function of either the cosmic time t or\nthe time variable \u03c4 through Eqn.(9).\n\n\f4\nA.\n\na0 \u2261 a(z = 0) (for simplicity of the calculations we\nchoose the normalization a0 = 1) then;\n\nParticular Cases\n\nWe shall study separately the simplest situations that\ncan be considered once the choice (8) is made. In both\ncases one deals with coupling functions of the exponential\nform: X(\u03c6) = X0 exp (n\u03c6), where X0 and n arepconstant\nparameters. If one chooses n = (2 \u2212 3\u03b3/2)/ \u03c9 + 3/2\nwhere \u03c9 is the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter, then the\naction (1) corresponds to Brans-Dicke theory written in\nthe Einstein frame (EF). In this case the EF scalar field\n\u03c6 is related to the Jordan frame scalar field \u03c6\u0302 through:\nd\u03c6 = d\u03c6\u0302/(\u03c9 + 3/2). In general, once the dynamics (8) is\nimposed, this kind of coupling function leads to double\nand single exponential potentials depending on r. The\nimportance of this class of potentials in cosmology has\nbeen already outlined in the introductory part of this\npaper.\n1.\n\nCase A\n\nLet us consider the simplest situation when, in Eq.\n(12);\nd ln X\n\u03bb(\u03b3 \u2212 2)\n=\n,\nd\u03c6\n2\n\n(16)\n\ni. e., we are faced with an exponential coupling function\nof the form mentioned above with r = \u03bb(\u03b3 \u2212 2)/2 in the\nexponent. In this case the equation (12) simplifies to\ndV\n+ \u03bbV = 0,\nd\u03c6\n\n2\n\n2\n\n6 \u2212 \u03bb2\n(1 + z)3\u03b3+\u03b3(6\u2212\u03bb )/2\u2212\u03bb\n,\n\u03a9m (z) =\n6A2 (1 + z)3\u03b3+\u03b3(6\u2212\u03bb2 )/2\u2212\u03bb2 + A2\n\n(22)\n\nand\nH(z) = B\n\nr\n\n1\n(1 + z)3\u03b3+\u03b3(6\u2212\u03bb2 )/2 + (1 + z)\u03bb2 , (23)\nA2\n\np\nwhere B = 2V0 /(6 \u2212 \u03bb2 ). Note that, \u03a9m is a maximum at z = \u221e: \u03a9m (\u221e) = (6 \u2212 \u03bb2 )/6A2 . In general one can write that, at the epoch of nucleosynthesis \u03a9m (\u221e) = (1 \u2212 \u01eb), where \u01eb is a very small number\n(the small fraction of dark energy component during nucleosynthesis epoch) \u01eb = [6(A2 \u2212 1) + \u03bb2 ]/6A2 . Taking into account the observational fact that, according to\nmodel-independent analysis of SNIa data[14], at present,\n(z = 0); \u03a9m (0) = 1/3, then (22) can be rewritten as\n2\n\n\u03a9m (z) =\n\n2\n\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)(1 + z)3\u03b3+\u03b3(6\u2212\u03bb )/2\u2212\u03bb\n,\n(1 + z)3\u03b3+\u03b3(6\u2212\u03bb2 )/2\u2212\u03bb2 + (2 \u2212 3\u01eb)\n\n(24)\n\nwhere now the solution exhibits only two free parameters\n\u03bb and \u01eb (the DM EOS parameter \u03b3 = 1).\nOther physical magnitudes of observational interest are\nthe quintessence equation of state (EOS) parameter and\nthe deceleration parameter, that are given by the following expressions:\n\n(17)\n\u03c9\u03c6 = \u22121 +\n\nwhich can be easily integrated to yield to a single exponential potential:\nV = V0 e\u2212\u03bb\u03c6 .\n\n(18)\n\nq = \u22121 +\n\nIn consequence the equation (15) can be written as\n\n\u03bb2\n,\n3\u03a9\u03c6\n\n(25)\n\n3\u03b3\n\u03bb2\n+\n\u03a9m ,\n2\n2\n\n(26)\n\nrespectively.\nZ\n\ndw\n\u221a\n= \u03bc(\u03c4 + \u03c40 )\nw2 + A2\n\n(19)\n2.\n\nCase B\n\n2\n\n)\nwhere w = exp(\u2212 \u03b3(6\u2212\u03bb\n\u03c6), A2 = V0 X0 /M and \u03bc =\n4\u03bb\np\n\u03b3 M (\u03bb2 \u2212 6)/8, so we have the explicit solution\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n4\u03bb\n\u03c6(\u03c4 ) = \u03c60 + ln sinh [\u03bc(\u03c4 + \u03c40 )] \u03b3(6\u2212\u03bb2 ) ,\n\n(20)\n\n4\u03bb\n\nd\n(ln X(\u03c6)) = const = \u03b1 \u21d2 X(\u03c6) = X0 e\u03b1\u03c6 ,\nd\u03c6\n\n(27)\n\nwhere X0 is an integration constant.

The usefulness of this kind of potential\nhas been already explained in the introduction and will\nbe briefly discussed later within the frame of the present\nmodel, when we study the stability of the corresponding\nl\nsolution. If one introduces the variable y = e\u2212 2 \u03c6 , the\nequation (15) can be written as\n\nZ\n\ndy\n\n(31)\n\nl\np\n=\u2212\n2\n2\n2\ny +b\n\nr\n\n2\u03bb2 X0 V0\n(\u03c4 + \u03c40 )\n6 \u2212 \u03bb2 b2\n\na(\u03c4 ) = a0 (sinh [\u03bc(\u03c4 + \u03c40 )])\n.\n(32)\nq\n2\u03bb2 X0 V0\nwhere \u03bc = \u2212 2l 6\u2212\u03bb\n2\na2 . On the other hand, by using\nthe Friedmann equation (3) and inserting the potential\n(28), one obtains the Hubble parameter as function of\nthe quintessence field \u03c6:\nH 2 (\u03c6) =\n\ni\n2V0 h 2 \u2212(\u03b1+3\u03b3/\u03bb)\u03c6\nb e\n+ e\u2212\u03bb\u03c6 ,\n2\n6\u2212\u03bb\n\n(33)\n\nwhere we have considered Eqn.(10). In terms of the scale\nfactor one has, instead,\ni\n2\n2V0 h 2 \u2212(\u03b1\u03bb+3\u03b3)\nH 2 (a) =\nb a\n+ a\u2212\u03bb .\n(34)\n2\n6\u2212\u03bb\n\nUsing the redshift variable z the above magnitudes can\nbe written as follows:\n\n\"\n#\n\u03bb2\n2\n(1\n+\nz)\n2V\nb\n0\n(z + 1)(\u03b1\u03bb+3\u03b3) +\n. (35)\nH 2 (z) =\n6 \u2212 \u03bb2\nb2\nIn turn, the energy density of DM can be written as\n\u03c1m (z) = (M/X0 )(z + 1)\u03b1\u03bb+3\u03b3 = \u03c10 (z + 1)\u03b1\u03bb+3\u03b3 , so\nthe DM dimensionless density parameter can be given\nas function of z also:\n2\n\n(30)\n\n(z + 1)\u03b1\u03bb+3\u03b3\u2212\u03bb\n(6 \u2212 \u03bb2 )\u03c10\n.\n\u03a9m (z) =\n2V0 b2 (z + 1)\u03b1\u03bb+3\u03b3\u2212\u03bb2 + 1/b2\n\n(36)\n\n\f6\n2\n\nIn order to constrain the parameter space of the solution one should consider the model to fit the observational evidence on a universe with an early matter\ndominated period and a former transition to dark energy dominance.3 Therefore \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03b1\u03bb \u2212 3\u03b3 < 0, besides,\nas before, one can write \u03a9m (\u221e) = (1 \u2212 \u01eb), where \u01eb is a\nsmall number (the small fraction of dark energy component during nucleosynthesis epoch). In correspondence\nb2 = [(6 \u2212 \u03bb2 )/(1 \u2212 \u01eb)](\u03c10 /2V0 ). Besides, if one considers,\nas before, that according to model-independent analysis\nof SNIa data[14], at present (z = 0); \u03a9m (0) = 1/3, then\n1/b2 = 2 \u2212 3\u01eb. After this Eqn.(36) can be rewritten in\nthe following way:\n\n\u03a9m (z) = (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\n\n(z + 1)\u03b1\u03bb+3\u03b3\u2212\u03bb\n,\n(z + 1)\u03b1\u03bb+3\u03b3\u2212\u03bb2 + (2 \u2212 3\u01eb)\n\n(37)\n\nso the solution depends on three free parameters: \u03b1, \u03bb\nand \u01eb (the barotropic index of the DM is fixed: \u03b3 = 1).\nThese can be chosen so that the solution fits well the observational data. Other physical magnitudes of observational interest are the quintessence EOS parameter and\nthe deceleration parameter in equations (25) and (26),\nrespectively.\nIn Figure 1, we show the evolution of both dimensionless DM and scalar-field energy densities \u03a9m and\n\u03a9\u03c6 respectively vs z for the single exponential potential (Case A). The corresponding evolution for Case B is\nvery similar. In Figure 2, the evolution of the dynamical\nquintessence EOS parameter vs z is plotted for the Model\nA (single exponential potential), for three different values of the parameter \u03bb: 0.3 (thick solid line), 1.41 (solid\nline), and 2.24 (dashed line) respectively. In all cases the\nfree parameter \u03b5 is chosen to be \u03b5 = 0.01. Note that\nonly the curve with the smallest value of the parameter\n\u03bb (thick solid line) meets the requirements of the present\nobservational data favoring a value of the EOS parameter\n\u03c9\u03c6 \u223c \u22121. Meanwhile, in Figure 3, we plot the evolution\nof the deceleration parameter q vs z for the Model A.\nAgain, the curve with the smallest value of the parameter \u03bb is the one that fits better the observational data\nset on a present stage of accelerated expansion[17, 18].\nFigures 4 and 5 show the behavior of \u03c9\u03c6 = \u03c9\u03c6 (z) and\nq = q(z) for different values of the free parameter \u03b1:\n0.1 (thick solid line), 1 (solid line), and 5 (dashed line).\nThe free parameters \u03b5 and \u03bb have been fixed ad hoc,\nguided by the results of the study of case A (\u03b5 = 0.01,\n\u03bb = 0.3). It is apparent that the present values of \u03c9\u03c6\nand of q, do not depend on \u03b1, so that this parameter can\nnot be determined from the observational data on the\npresent stage of accelerated expansion of the universe.\n\n3\n\nSince we are dealing with models with non-minimal coupling\nbetween the quintessence and the matter fields, here we refer,\nmainly, to a model-independent analysis of SNIa observational\ndata[14, 15, 16].\n\nstate parameter\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n3\nredshift\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 4: We plot the dynamical EOS parameter of the\nquintessence vs z, for the Model B (double exponential potential), for three different values of the parameter \u03b1: 0.1\n(thick solid line), 1 (solid line), and 5 (dashed line) respectively.

The\npresent value of the deceleration parameter is independent on\nthe value of \u03b1.\n\nThis parameter could be of impact if the model is applied\nto study early stages in the cosmic evolution.\n\nIV.\n\nEXISTENCE AND STABILITY OF THE\nSOLUTIONS\n\nWe now turn to the study of the stability of the solutions found.

Besides we consider \u03c7(a) = \u03c70 a\u03b4 , where\n\u03b4 is some constant parameter. This choice of the coupling function comprises many useful situations (including the solutions we have derived before) and it implies\nthat (ln \u03c7)\u2032 = \u03b4. We assume, also, that \u03c9m = 0 \u21d2 \u03b3 = 1,\ni. e., the background fluid is dust. For the flat space case\n(k = 0), the system (44) should be complemented with\nthe following constraint equation:\n0 \u2264 y \u2212 x \u2264 1,\n\n(45)\n\nwhich follows from requiring that the positive dimensionless matter energy density parameter \u03a9m \u2264 1.\nThe first step towards the study of the dynamics of\nthe autonomous system (44) is to find its critical points\n(xc , yc ) \u21d2 (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = (0, 0). Then one can investigate\ntheir stability by expanding equations (44) in the vicinity\nof the critical points x = xc + u, y = yc + v (up to terms\nlinear in the perturbations u, v):\nu\u2032\nv\u2032\n\n!\n\n=\u039b\n\nu\nv\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(46)\n\nwhere \u039b is the matrix of the coefficients in the expansion. The general solution for the evolution of the linear\nperturbations can be written as:\nu = u1 e\u03bb1 N + u2 e\u03bb2 N ,\nv = v1 e\u03bb1 N + v2 e\u03bb2 N ,\n\n(47)\n\nwhere \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the eigenvalues of the matrix \u039b.\nIn table I we show the properties of the critical points\n(including existence and stability) for the case A above,\nmeanwhile, in table II, the corresponding eigenvalues are\ngiven. In this case X = X0 e\u2212\u03bb\u03c6/2 . As seen, for the\nvalues of \u03bb that make the model fit better the observational data set (0 \u2264 \u03bb < 1), the first critical point\n(x, y) = (1, 1) \u21d2 \u03a9\u03c6 = 1 (quintessence dominated\nphase) is a stable attractor, while the scaling solution\n(x, y) = (\u03bb2 /6, 1) \u21d2 \u03a9m /\u03a9\u03c6 = 6/\u03bb2 \u2212 1 > 1, is always\nunstable. The phase portrait for this case is shown in\nfig.6. All of the trajectories in phase plane (x, y), diverge\nfrom the unstable point (matter dominated scaling solution) and converge towards the attractor (quintessence\ndominated) solution.\nThe properties of the critical points and the corresponding eigenvalues for case B, where X = X0 e\u03b1\u03c6 , are\nshown in tables III and IV respectively. It is apparent\nthat, for the relevant ranges of the free parameters 0 \u2264\n\u03bb < 1 and 0 < \u03b1 < 3/\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb, the quintessence dominated\nsolution (first critical point (x, y) = (1, 1)) is always a stable node.

The\ncritical point (1, 1) is stable (a sink) so that the quintessence\ndominated solution is the late time attractor. The scaling\nregime (0.015, 1) is an unstable point. The saddle is located\nat (0.045, 0.045). All the phase space trajectories diverge\nfrom the unstable point and converge towards the attractor.\n\nond critical point ((x, y) = (\u03bb(\u03bb + \u03b1)/3, 1))- could be either a saddle (1/\u03bb < \u03b1 < 3/\u03bb\u2212\u03bb) or ,otherwise, an unstable node. The phase portrait fig.7 shows that, for the values of the free parameters chosen (\u03bb = 0.3, \u03b1 = 5.7), all\nphase space trajectories diverge from the unstable node\n(third critical point (x, y) = (\u03bb2 /2, \u03bb2 /2)-quintessence\ndominated solution with curvature) and, either converge\ntowards the stable attractor solution dominated by the\nquintessence (first critical point), or are repelled by the\nsaddle point (second critical point- the matter dominated scaling solution). This result, that is generic for\nboth solutions A and B, shows that, since the scaling\n(quintessence dominated) solution with \u03a9m /\u03a9\u03c6 . 1 is\nnot even a critical point of the corresponding autonomous\ndynamical system (equations (44)), then the coincidence\nproblem could arise in the cases studied in the present\ninvestigation. In the next subsection we will show in a\nmore definitive manner that this is indeed the case.\nA.\n\nThe coincidence problem\n\nLet us investigate whether, in the situations of interest\nin the present study, the question: why are the energy\ndensities of the dark matter and of the dark energy of the\nsame order precisely at present? arises. For this purpose\nit is recommended to study the dynamics of the ratio[13]:\nr=\n\n\u03a9m\n\u03c1m\n=\n,\n\u03c1\u03c6\n\u03a9\u03c6\n\n(48)\n\nin respect to the variable N \u2261 ln a, that, as said before, is\nrelated with the cosmic time t through dN = Hdt.

The quintessence dominated solution (point (1,\n1) in the phase plane) is an attractor. The scaling solution\n(critical point (0.6, 1)) is a saddle, meanwhile (0.045, 0.045)\nis an unstable point. For different values of the parameter\n\u03b1, the separation between the saddle (scaling phase) and the\nstable (quintessence dominated) critical points varies.\n\nwhere the prime denotes derivative in respect to the variable N and f is an arbitrary function (at least of class\nC 1 ) of r. One is then primarily interested in the equilibrium points of equation (49), i.e., those points rei at\nwhich f (rei ) = 0. After that one expands f in the\nneighborhood of each equilibrium point; r = rei + \u01ebi ,\nso that, up to terms linear in the perturbations \u01ebi :\nf (r) = (df /dr)rei \u01ebi + O(\u01ebi ) \u21d2 \u01eb\u2032i = (df /dr)rei \u01ebi . This\nlast equation can be integrated to yield the evolution of\nthe perturbations:\n\u01ebi = \u01eb0i exp [(df /dr)rei N ],\n\n(50)\n\nwhere \u01eb0i are arbitrary integration constants. It is seen\nfrom (50) that, only those perturbations for which:\n(df /dr)rei < 0,\n\n(51)\n\ndecay with the time variable N , and the corresponding\nequilibrium point is stable. The coincidence is evaded if\nthe point \u03c1m /\u03c1\u03c6 = rei . 1 is stable.\nNow, if we take into account the conservation equations (40), and (41), where Q = \u2212(ln X)\u2032 \u03c1m , and since\n\u03a9\u03c6 = 1/(r + 1), implying that (see equation (25)) the\nquintessence EOS parameter \u03c9\u03c6 can be written as function of r: \u03c9\u03c6 = \u22121+\u03bb2 (r+1)/3, then, for the cases under\nstudy here, the function f can be given by the following\nexpression:\nf (r) = r{(\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03b4)(r + 1) \u2212 3},\n\n(52)\n\nwhere \u03b4 = (ln X)\u2032 = n\u03bb. For the case A: \u03b4 = \u2212\u03bb2 /2,\nwhile for the case B: \u03b4 = \u03bb\u03b1. It can be easily checked\nthat, in both cases the only stable equilibrium point is the\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have found a new parametric class of exact cosmological scaling solutions in a theory with general nonminimal coupling between the components of the cosmic mixture: cold dark matter and dark energy (the\nquintessence field). Baryons, although subdominant at\npresent, in the past of the cosmic evolution played a\nrelevant role and could be included as part of the dark\nmatter component in the present setup. There are suggestive arguments showing that observational bounds on\nthe \"fifth\" force do not necessarily imply decoupling of\nbaryons from quintessence[13]. To specify the general\nform of the coupling we considered a scalar tensor theory\nof gravity written in the Einstein frame. An alternative\ninterpretation is to consider it as an effective theory, implying additional non-gravitational interaction between\nthe components of the cosmic fluid.\nIn order to derive exact flat FRW solutions to the\nmodel under study, we have assumed a linear relationship between the Hubble expansion parameter and the\ntime derivative of the scalar field. Mathematically this\nassumption allows to reduce the original system of second order differential equations to a single, first order\ndifferential equation, involving only the self-interaction\npotential and the coupling function (together with their\nfirst derivatives in respect to the scalar field variable).\nHowever, simplicity of the mathematical handling is at\nthe cost of retaining the problem of the coincidence. In\nfact, the solution generating ansatz (8), implies that solutions where the ratio \u03c1m /\u03c1\u03c6 = const \u223c 1 are not stable.\nIn the cases studied, only the quintessence dominated\nsolution is stable. Anyway, the assumed relationship between the square root of the scalar field kinetic energy\nand the Hubble parameter is the simplest possible and,\nin the absence of any other information is, in a sense, the\nmost natural since the Hubble parameter fixes the time\nscale.\nWe have concentrated our study in exponential class\nof coupling functions. Brans-Dicke theory is a particular\nmember in this class. Exponential coupling functions can\nlead to self-interaction potentials of the following class:\nA) single exponential potential and B) double exponential potential. The stability and existence of the solutions\nfound have been also studied. For this purpose we have\napplied a fairly general method in which one does not\nneed to specify any model for the dark energy. In both\ncases (case A and case B), the dynamical system exhibits\nthree critical points. For the values of the free parameters\nthat are allowed by the observational data, the scalar field\n(quintessence) dominated solution is always an attractor,\nmeanwhile the scaling (matter dominated) solution can\nbe either an unstable node or a saddle point.\n\n\f10\nWe conclude that models with non-minimal coupling\nbetween the dark energy and the dark matter are easy\nto handle mathematically if one assumes a suitable dynamics. This is some times, at the cost of retaining the\nproblem of the coincidence. The present investigation\ncould be complemented by the study of different classes\nof self-interaction potentials and/or the choice of suitable\ndynamics allowing to evade the coincidence problem; one\nof the motivations to study models with interaction be-\n\ntween the components of the cosmic mixture.\n\n[1] C.
