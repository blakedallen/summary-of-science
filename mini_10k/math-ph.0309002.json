We study the theory of the (1/2, 0) \u2295 (0, 1/2) representation\nin helicity basis. Helicity eigenstates are not the parity eigenstates. This is\nin accordance with the consideration of Berestetski\u0131\u0306, Lifshitz and Pitaevski\u0131\u0306.\nRelations to the Gelfand-Tsetlin-Sokolik-type quantum field theory are discussed. Finally, a new form of the parity operator is proposed. It commutes\nwith the Hamiltonian.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to congratulate Professor J. Plebanski with his 75th birthday.\nThank you for your hard work in theoretical physics, which we all admire.\nWhat are scientific motivations for my talk? Recently we generalized the Dirac formalism [1\u20134] and the Bargmann-Wigner formalism [5,7], and on this basis we proposed a set\nof twelve equations for antisymmetric tensor (AST) field; some of them may lead to parityviolating transitions. In this paper we are going to study somewhat related matter, the\ntransformation from the standard basis to the helicity basis in the Dirac theory. The spin\nbasis rotation changes the properties of corresponding states with respect to parity. The\nparity is a physical quantum number; so, we try to extract corresponding physical contents\nfrom considerations of the various spin bases.\nBriefly, I repeat the results of ref. [6,7]. One can find solutions of the 2(2J + 1)-theory\nwith different parity properties [6]. They can be related to the polarization vectors obtained\nby Ruck and Greiner [8], who found the helicity states of the 4-vector potential on the basis\nof the Jackob and Wick paper [9]. Next, I used the generalized Bargmann-Wigner formalism\nbased on the equations1\n\n\u2217 Presented\n\nat the Plebanski Conference \"Topics in Mathematical Physics, General Relativity and\nCosmology\", September 17-20, 2002, CINVESTAV, D. F., M\u00e9xico and the Jornadas de Investigaci\u00f3n UAZ-2002, Zacatecas, Oct. 8-11, 2002.\n1 The\n\nparity-violating Dirac equation has been derived in [4]. The method of the derivation refers\nto the van der Waerden, Sakurai and Gersten works, see references in the previous papers of mine.\n\n1\n\n\f[i\u03b3\u03bc \u2202\u03bc + \u01eb1 m1 + \u01eb2 m2 \u03b35 ]\u03b1\u03b2 \u03a8\u03b2\u03b3 = 0 ,\n[i\u03b3\u03bc \u2202\u03bc + \u01eb3 m1 + \u01eb4 m2 \u03b35 ]\u03b1\u03b2 \u03a8\u03b3\u03b2 = 0 ,\n\n(1a)\n(1b)\n\nDifferent equations for the antisymmetric tensor field follow from this set by means of the\nstandard procedure [10]. We concluded in [7] in part that: 1) in the (1/2, 0) \u2295 (0, 1/2)\nrepresentation it is possible to introduce the parity-violating frameworks; 2) the mappings\nbetween the Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer formalism for J = 1 and the AST fields of the 2nd\nrank of, at least, eight types exist; Four of them include both F\u03bc\u03bd and F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , which tells us\nthat the parity violation may occur during the study of the corresponding dynamics; 3)\nif we want to take into account the J = 1 solutions with different parity properties, the\nBargmann-Wigner (BW) formalism is to be generalized; 4) the 4-potentials and the fields\nin the helicity basis can be constructed; they have different parity properties comparing\nwith the standard (\"parity\") basis; 5) generalizing the BW formalism in such a way, twelve\nequations for the AST fields have been obtained; 6) finally, a hypothesis was proposed\ntherein that the obtained results are related to the spin basis rotations and to the choice of\nnormalization.\nBeginning the consideration of the helicity basis, we observe that it is well known that\nthe operator \u015c3 = \u03c3 3 /2 \u2297 I2 does not commute with the Dirac Hamiltonian unless the\n3-momentum is aligned along with the third axis and the plane-wave expansion is used:\n[\u0124, \u015c3 ]\u2212 = (\u03b3 0 \u03b3 k \u00d7 \u2207i )3\n\n(2)\n\nMoreover, Berestetski\u0131\u0306, Lifshitz and Pitaevski\u0131\u0306 wrote [11]: \"... the orbital angular momentum\nl and the spin s of a moving particle are not separately conserved. Only the total angular\nmomentum j = l + s is conserved. The component of the spin in any fixed direction (taken\nas z-axis is therefore also not conserved, and cannot be used to enumerate the polarization\n(spin) states of moving particle.\" The similar conclusion has been given by Novozhilov in\nb /2 \u2297 I, p\nb = p/|p|, commutes\nhis book [12]. On the other hand, the helicity operator \u03c3 * p\nwith the Hamiltonian (more precisely, the commutator is equal to zero when acting the\none-particle plane-wave solutions).\nSo, it is a bit surprising, why the 4-spinors have been studied so well when the basis was\nchosen in such a way that they are eigenstates of the \u015c3 operator:\nu1,1\n2 2\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\n1\n\uf8ec0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n+\n\uf8f7 , u 1 ,\u2212 1 = N\u2212\n= N+\n1 \uf8ec\n1\n2\n2\n2 \uf8ed1\uf8f8\n2\n0\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n1\n\uf8ec1\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2212\n\uf8f7 , v 1 ,\u2212 1 = N\u2212\n\uf8ec \uf8f7 , v1,1 = N\u2212\n1 \uf8ec\n1\n2 2\n2\n2\n\uf8ed0\uf8f8\n2 \uf8ed \u22121 \uf8f8\n2\n1\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 ,\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\n\u22121\n\n(3)\n\nand, oppositely, the helicity basis case has not been studied almost at all (see, however,\nrefs.

The 4spinors might be not the eigenspinors of the helicity operator of the (1/2, 0)\u2295(0, 1/2) representation\nspace, cf. [2]. They might be the eigenstates of the chiral helicity operator introduced in [2a]. In\nthis case, the momentum-space Dirac equations can be written (cf.

Indeed, the 4-spinors\n(10a,10b) satisfy the Dirac equation in the spinorial representation of the \u03b3-matrices (see\nstraightforwardly from (7)). Hence, the parity-transformed function \u03a8\u2032 (t, \u2212x) = P \u03a8(t, x)\nmust satisfy\n[i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc\u2032 \u2212 m]\u03a8\u2032 (t, \u2212x) = 0 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwith \u2202\u03bc\u2032 = (\u2202/\u2202t, \u2212\u2207i ). This is possible when P \u22121 \u03b3 0 P = \u03b3 0 and P \u22121 \u03b3 i P = \u2212\u03b3 i . The matrix\n(12) satisfies these requirements, as in the textbook case.\nNext, it is easy to prove that one can form the projection operators\np\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc + m\n,\n2m\n\u03bb\nX\nm \u2212 p\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc\nP\u2212 = \u2212\n,\nv\u03bb (p)v\u0304\u03bb (p) =\n2m\n\u03bb\n\nP+ = +\n\nX\n\nu\u03bb (p)\u016b\u03bb (p) =\n\n(14a)\n(14b)\n\nwith the properties P+ + P\u2212 = 1 and P\u00b12 = P\u00b1 . This permits us to expand the 4-spinors\ndefined in the basis (3) in linear superpositions of the helicity basis 4-spinors and to find\ncorresponding coefficients of the expansion:\nu\u03c3 (p) = A\u03c3\u03bb u\u03bb (p) + B\u03c3\u03bb v\u03bb (p) ,\nv\u03c3 (p) = C\u03c3\u03bb u\u03bb (p) + D\u03c3\u03bb v\u03bb (p) .\n\n(15a)\n(15b)\n\nMultiplying the above equations by \u016b\u03bb\u2032 , v\u0304\u03bb\u2032 and using the normalization conditions, we\nobtain A\u03c3\u03bb = D\u03c3\u03bb = \u016b\u03bb u\u03c3 , B\u03c3\u03bb = C\u03c3\u03bb = \u2212v\u0304\u03bb u\u03c3 . Thus, the transformation matrix from the\ncommon-used basis to the helicity basis is\n\n4 Of\n\ncourse, there are no any mathematical difficulties to change it to the normalization to \u00b1m,\nwhich may be more convenient for our study of the massless limit.\n\n4\n\n\f\u0012\n\nu\u03c3\nv\u03c3\n\n\u0013\n\n=U\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nu\u03bb\n,\nv\u03bb\n\nU=\n\n\u0012\n\nA\nB\n\nB\nA\n\n\u0013\n\n(16)\n\nNeither A nor B are unitary:\nA = (a++ + a+\u2212 )(\u03c3\u03bc a\u03bc ) + (\u2212a\u2212+ + a\u2212\u2212 )(\u03c3\u03bc a\u03bc )\u03c33 ,\nB = (\u2212a++ + a+\u2212 )(\u03c3\u03bc a\u03bc ) + (a\u2212+ + a\u2212\u2212 )(\u03c3\u03bc a\u03bc )\u03c33 ,\n\n(17a)\n(17b)\n\na0 = \u2212i cos(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03c6/2) \u2208 Im , a1 = sin(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03c6/2) \u2208 Re ,\na2 = sin(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03c6/2) \u2208 Re , a3 = cos(\u03b8/2) cos(\u03c6/2) \u2208 Re ,\n\n(18a)\n(18b)\n\nwhere\n\nand\na++ =\n\nq\n\na\u2212+ =\n\nq\n\n(E + m)(E + p)\n\u221a\n,\n2 2m\n\na+\u2212 =\n\nq\n\n(E \u2212 m)(E + p)\n\u221a\n,\n2 2m\n\na\u2212\u2212 =\n\nq\n\n(E + m)(E \u2212 p)\n\u221a\n,\n2 2m\n\n(19a)\n\n(E \u2212 m)(E \u2212 p)\n\u221a\n.\n2 2m\n\n(19b)\n\nHowever, A\u2020 A + B \u2020 B = 11, so the matrix U is unitary. Please note that this matrix acts on\nthe spin indices (\u03c3,\u03bb), and not on the spinorial indices; it is 4 \u00d7 4 matrix.

It is expected that \u03bb \u2192 \u2212\u03bb under parity, as\nBerestetski\u0131\u0306, Lifshitz and Pitaevski\u0131\u0306 claimed [11].5 With respect to p \u2192 \u2212p (i. e., the\nspherical system angles \u03b8 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c6) the helicity 2-eigenspinors transform as\nfollows: \u03c6\u2191\u2193 \u21d2 \u2212i\u03c6\u2193\u2191 , ref.

Hence,\nP u\u2191(\u2212p) = \u2212iu\u2193 (p) , P v\u2191(\u2212p) = +iv\u2193 (p) ,\nP u\u2193(\u2212p) = \u2212iu\u2191 (p) , P v\u2193(\u2212p) = +iv\u2191 (p) .\n\n(21a)\n(21b)\n\nThus, on the level of classical fields, we observe that the helicity 4-spinors transform to the\n4-spinors of the opposite helicity.\nUnder the charge conjugation operation we have:\nC=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n0\n\u0398\nK.\n\u2212\u0398 0\n\n5 Indeed,\n\n(22)\n\nif x \u2192 \u2212x, then the vector p \u2192 \u2212p, but the axial vector S \u2192 S, that implies the above\nstatement.\n\n5\n\n\fHence, we observe\nCu\u2191 (p) = \u2212v\u2193 (p) , Cv\u2191 (p) = +u\u2193(p) ,\nCu\u2193 (p) = +v\u2191 (p) , Cv\u2193 (p) = \u2212u\u2191 (p) .\n\n(23a)\n(23b)\n\ndue to the properties of the Wigner operator \u0398\u03c6\u2217\u2191 = \u2212\u03c6\u2193 and \u0398\u03c6\u2217\u2193 = +\u03c6\u2191 .

We prefer to use the method described\nin [18, \u00a710.2-10.3].\nP R 3\nIt is based on the anzatz that UP = exp[i\u03b1\u00c2] exp[iB\u0302] with \u00c2 = s d p[a\u2020p,s a\u2212ps + b\u2020ps b\u2212ps ]\nP R\nand B\u0302 = s d3 p[\u03b2a\u2020p,s aps + \u03b3b\u2020ps bps ]. On using the known operator identity\ne\u00c2 B\u0302e\u2212\u00c2 = B\u0302 + [\u00c2, B\u0302]\u2212 +\n\n1\n[\u00c2, [\u00c2, B\u0302]] + . . .\n2!\n\n(37)\n\nand [\u00c2, B\u0302 \u0108]\u2212 = [\u00c2, B\u0302]+ \u0108 \u2212 B\u0302[\u00c2, \u0108]+ one can fix the parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 such that satisfy\nthe physical requirements that a Dirac particle and its anti-particle have opposite intrinsic\nparities.\nIn our case, we need to satisfy (27a), i.e., the operator should invert not only the sign of\nthe momentum, but the sign of the helicity too. We may achieve this goal by the analogous\npostulate UP = ei\u03b1\u00c2 with\nXZ\n\n\u00c2 =\n\ns\n\nd3 p \u2020\n[a\u03bb (p)a\u2212\u03bb (\u2212p) + b\u2020\u03bb (p)b\u2212\u03bb (\u2212p)] .\n2E\n\n(38)\n\nBy direct verification, the equations (27a) are satisfied provided that \u03b1 = \u03c0/2. Cf. this\nparity operator with that given in [17,18] for Dirac fields:8\n\"\n\nUP = exp i\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 p\n\nX\u0010\n\na(p, s)\u2020 a(p\u0303, s) + b(p, s)\u2020 b(p\u0303, s)\u2212\n\ns\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2212a(p, s) a(p, s) + d(p, s)\u2020 b(p, s)\n\n\u0011i\n\n,\n\n(10.69) of ref. [18] .\n\n(39)\n\nBy direct verification one can also come to the conclusion that our new UP commutes with\nthe Hamiltonian:\nH=\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nd x\u0398\n\n00\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nd3 k\n\nX\n\u03bb\n\n[a\u2020\u03bb (k)a\u03bb (k) \u2212 b\u03bb (k)b\u2020\u03bb (k)] ,\n\n(40)\n\ni.e.\n\n8 Greiner\n\n\u03b43 (p\n\nh\n\ni\n\nused the following commutation relations a(p, s), a\u2020 (p\u2032 , s\u2032 )\n\np\u2032 )\u03b4ss\u2032 .\n\n+\n\nh\n\ni\n\n= b(p, s), b\u2020 (p\u2032 , s\u2032 )\n\n+\n\n=\n\nOne should also note that the Greiner form of the parity operator is not the only\n\u2212\none. Itzykson and Zuber [17] proposed another one differing by the phase factors from (10.69)\nof [18]. In order to find relations between those two forms of the parity operator one should apply\nadditional rotation in the Fock space.\n\n8\n\n\f[UP , H]\u2212 = 0 .\n\n(41)\n\nAlternatively, we can try to choose another set of commutation relations [2b,3] (for the set\nof bi-orthonormal states), that will be the matter of future publications.\nFinally, due to the fact that my recent works are related to the so-called \"BargmannWightman-Wigner-type\" quantum field theory, I want to clarify some misunderstandings\nin the recent discussions. This type of theories has been first proposed by Gel'fand and\nTsetlin [19a]. In fact, it is based on the two-dimensional representation of the inversion\ngroup, which is used when someone needs to construct a theory where C and P anticommute. They indicated applicability of this theory to the description of the set of K-mesons\nand possible relations to the Lee-Yang result. The comutativity/anticommutativity of the\ndiscrete symmetry operations has also been investigated by Foldy and Nigam [20]. Relations of the Gel'fand-Tsetlin construct to the representations of the anti-de Sitter SO(3, 2)\ngroup and the general relativity theory (including continuous and discrete transformations)\nhave been discussed in [19b] and in subsequent papers of Sokolik. E. Wigner [21] presented\nsomewhat related results at the Istanbul School on Theoretical Physics in 1962. Later,\nFushchich discussed corresponding wave equations. At last, in the paper [22] the authors\ncalled a theory where a boson and its antiboson have opposite intrinsic parities as the theory\nof \"the Bargmann-Wightman-Wigner type\". Actually, the theory presented by Ahluwalia,\nGoldman and Johnson is the Dirac-like generalization of the Weinberg 2(2J + 1)-theory for\nthe spin 1. It has already been presented in the Sankaranarayanan and Good paper of 1965,\nref. [23]. In ref. [22b] (and in the previous IF-UNAM preprints of 1994) I presented a theory\nbased on a set of 6-component Weinberg-like equations (I called them the \"Weinberg doubles\"). In ref. [2b] the theory in the ( 12 , 0) \u2295 (0, 12 ) representation based on the chiral helicity\n4-eigenspinors was proposed. The connection with the Foldy and Nigam consideration has\nbeen claimed. The corresponding equations have been obtained in [3] and in several less\nknown articles. However, later we found the papers by Ziino and Barut [1] and the Markov\npapers [24], which also have connections with the subject under consideration.\nA similar theory may be constructed from our consideration above if we define the field\noperators as follows:\n\u221a\nZ\ni\nd3 p m h\n\u2020\n\u2020 +ip\u03bc x\u03bc\n\u2212ip\u03bc x\u03bc\n\u03a81 =\n,\n(42a)\n(u\na\n+\nv\nb\n)e\n+\n(u\na\n+\nv\nb\n)e\n\u2191 \u2191\n\u2191 \u2191\n\u2191 \u2191\n\u2191 \u2191\n(2\u03c0)3 2E\n\u221a\nZ\ni\nd3 p m h\n\u2020\n\u2020 +ip\u03bc x\u03bc\n\u2212ip\u03bc x\u03bc\n.\n(42b)\n(u\na\n\u2212\nv\nb\n)e\n+\n(u\na\n\u2212\nv\nb\n)e\n\u03a82 =\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u2193\n(2\u03c0)3 2E\nThe conclusions of my talk are:\n\u2022 Similarly to the ( 12 , 21 ) representation, the ( 12 , 0) \u2295 (0, 12 ) field functions in the helicity\nbasis are not eigenstates of the common-used parity operator; |p, \u03bb >\u21d2 | \u2212 p, \u2212\u03bb >\nboth on the classical and quantum levels. This is in accordance with the earlier\nconsideration of Berestetski\u0131\u0306, Lifshitz and Pitaevski\u0131\u0306.\n\u2022 Helicity field functions may satisfy the ordinary Dirac equation with \u03b3's to be in\nthe spinorial representation. Meanwhile, the chiral helicity field functions satisfy the\nequations of the form p\u0302\u03a81 \u2212 m\u03a82 = 0.\n9\n\n\f\u2022 Helicity field functions can be expanded in the set of the Dirac 4-spinors by means of the\nmatrix U \u22121 given in this paper. Neither A, nor B are unitary, however A\u2020 A+B \u2020 B = 11.\n\u2022 P and C operations anticommute in this framework, both on the classical and quantum\nlevels (this is opposite to the theory based on the chiral helicity eigenstates [3].\n\u2022 Particle and antiparticle may have either the same or the opposite properties with\nrespect to parity. The answer depends on the choice of the phase factor in UP \u03a8UP\u22121 =\nei\u03b1 \u03b3 0 \u03a8\u2032 ; alternatively, that can be made by additional rotation UP2 .\n\u2022 Earlier confusions in the discussion of the Gelfand-Tsetlin-Sokolik-Nigam-FoldyBargmann-Wightman-Wigner-type (GTsS-NF-BWW) quantum field theory have been\nclarified.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI am grateful for discussions to Prof. Z.
