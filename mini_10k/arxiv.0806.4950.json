Introduction\nWithin the past decade, several different experiments have been focusing on the measurements of\nCP violation in various flavor violating B decays.\nThe main aim is to test the Standard Model (SM)\nwhich contains only one source of CP violation. A\ndefinitive discrepancy between experimentally measured and theoretically predicted CP asymmetries in\nB decays, if found, would indicate the presence of new\nCP violating sources beyond the SM.\nAccording to a recent UTf it study about the Bs\nmixing phase [1], together with updated data from\nBelle for Bu,d \u2192 \u03c0K [2], b \u2192 s transition is seemingly affected by CP violating new physics (NP). However, none of large discrepancies with the SM has been\nfound in b \u2192 d phenomena at present [3]. In fact, the\nCP violation in Bs \u2192 \u03c0K, recently measured by CDF,\nwould agree with the SM expectation [4].\nIt is worth mentioning that the strong hint of NP is\nindicated in certain b \u2192 s CP violating phenomena. If\nthe current observations are confirmed by further experimental improvements, what kind of NP scenario\nappears to be plausible? Throughout our presentation, we assume that U-spin symmetry reasonably\nholds among different B decays. We then point out\nthat the similar hint of NP can be found by comparing\nBd \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 0 with Bs \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 0 . We also very shortly\ndiscuss the polarizations of Bs \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 , \u03c6K\u0304 \u22170 .\n\n2. U-spin symmetry and Standard Model\nSometime ago it was pointed out that, within the\nSM, a relation involving decay rates and direct CP\nasymmetries holds for the B decay pairs that are related by U-spin [5, 6]. U-spin is the symmetry that\nplaces d and s quarks on an equal footing. The pairs\nassociated with B \u2192 \u03c0K are listed in Table I, as\nwell as two pairs of neutral B decays into two vector\nmesons, which are discussed in our presentation.\nIn the limit of U-spin symmetry, the effective Hamiltonian describing a b \u2192 d transition is equal to that\n\nb\u0304 \u2192 s\u0304\nBd0 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212\nBd0 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 0\n+\n0 +\n\n#1\n#2\n#3 B \u2192 K \u03c0\n#4 Bs0 \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170\n#5 Bd0 \u2192 \u03c6K \u22170\n\n\u2190\u2192\nb\u0304 \u2192 d \u0304\n0\n\u2190\u2192 Bs \u2192 \u03c0 + K \u2212\n\u2190\u2192 Bs0 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 0\n\u2190\u2192 B + \u2192 K\u0304 0 K +\n\u2190\u2192 Bd0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u22170\n\u2190\u2192 Bs0 \u2192 \u03c6K\u0304 \u22170\n\nTable I The pairs of B decays which are related by\nU-spin. #1-#3 are for B decays into two pseudoscalar\nmesons [6], while #4-#5 are for B decays into two vector\nmesons.\n\nof the corresponding b \u2192 s transition, where the elements of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)\nmatrix are changed appropriately. With the CKM\nunitarity relation [7],\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nIm(Vub\nVus Vcb Vcs\n) = \u2212Im(Vub\nVud Vcb Vcd\n),\n\n(1)\n\na perfect U-spin symmetry guarantees the following\nrelation,\n|A(B \u2192 f )|2 \u2212 |A(B\u0304 \u2192 f \u0304)|2\n\u0003\n\u0002\n= \u2212 |A(U B \u2192 U f )|2 \u2212 |A(U B\u0304 \u2192 U f \u0304)|2 , (2)\nin which U is the U-spin operator that transposes d\nand s quarks. This expression can be written as\nBR(decay #2)\n\u2212Adir\n(decay #1)\nCP\n=\n,\ndir\nACP (decay #2)\nBR(decay #1)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Adir\nand BR refer to the direct CP asymmetry\nCP\nand branching ratio, respectively, and where decays\n#1,2 are the b \u2192 d and b \u2192 s decays, in either order,\nrelated by U-spin. Note that if decays #1,2 include\nBd and Bs mesons, there is an additional factor on\nthe right-hand side taking the lifetime difference into\naccount.\nLet us now look at pair #1. Ref. [8] has paid special\nattention to this pair and argued about a test of the\nSM vs. NP.\n\n\f2\n\nFlavor Physics and CP Violation Conference, Taipei, 2008\nMode\nB+ \u2192 \u03c0+K 0\nB+ \u2192 \u03c00K +\nBd0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K +\nBd0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 K 0\nBs \u2192 \u03c0 + K \u2212\n\nBR[10\u22126 ]\n23.1 \u00b1 1.0\n12.9 \u00b1 0.6\n19.4 \u00b1 0.6\n9.9 \u00b1 0.6\n5.00 \u00b1 1.25\n\nACP [%]\n0.9 \u00b1 2.5\n5.0 \u00b1 2.5\n\u22129.7 \u00b1 1.2\n\u221214 \u00b1 11\n39 \u00b1 17\n\nTable II Branching ratios and direct CP asymmetries for\nthe B \u2192 \u03c0K decays. The data is taken from Ref. [3].\n\nThe decay amplitudes for pair #1 are given by\n\u2217\n\u2217 (s)\nA(Bd \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = Vub\nVus A(s)\nu + Vcb Vcs Ac ,\n\n\u2217\n\u2217 (d)\nA(Bs \u2192 \u03c0 + K \u2212 ) = Vub\nVud A(d)\nu + Vcb Vcd Ac ,(4)\n(q)\n\n(q)\n\nwhere Au and Ac , with q = s, d, are strong decay\nfactors from tree and penguin amplitudes. The index\nq refers to the b \u2192 q transition in the penguin diagrams. To date there is no firm evidence, in B decays\ninto two pseudoscalar mesons, that nonfactorizable\ncontributions (including penguin annihilation effects\n[9]) are sizable. We therefore employ a picture where\nthe nonfactorizable terms are simply higher-order contributions and less important than the (naive) factorizable terms. As long as this picture reasonably\nholds, the U-spin breaking effects are expected to\n(d)\n(s)\nbe small. One then finds that Au = Au = Au\n(s)\n(d)\nand Ac = Ac = Ac are good approximations,\nand Eq.(3) is satisfied for pair #1 within the SM. In\nthe following discussion, we basically follow the same\nstrategy.\nRecent experimental results for B \u2192 \u03c0K are collected in Table II. Using these data, we can estimate\nthe U-spin relation for pair #1, and it turns out\n\n\u2212\n\n+\n\n\u2192\u03c0 K )\n= 3.9 \u00b1 1.0.\n\u2192 \u03c0+ K \u2212)\n\nIn fact, for b \u2192 s decays, there are two classes\nof NP operators, differing in their color structure:\ns\u0304\u03b1 \u0393i b\u03b1 q\u0304\u03b2 \u0393j q\u03b2 and s\u0304\u03b1 \u0393i b\u03b2 q\u0304\u03b2 \u0393j q\u03b1 . The first class of\nNP operators contributes with no color suppression to\nfinal states containing q\u0304q mesons. Similarly, for final\nstates with s\u0304q mesons, the roles of the two classes of\noperators are reversed, but there is a suppression fac\u2032\ntor of 1/Nc . As in Ref. [11], we denote by A\u2032,q ei\u03a6q and\n\u2032C\nA\u2032C ,q ei\u03a6q the sum of NP operators which contribute\nto final states involving q\u0304q and s\u0304q mesons, respectively\n(the primes indicate a b \u2192 s transition). Here, \u03a6\u2032q and\n\u03a6\u2032qC stand for the NP weak phases.\nLet us now return to Bu,d \u2192 \u03c0K decays in order\nto study the effect of the NP operators on b \u2192 s\ntransitions. In Ref. [13], the relative sizes of the SM\nBu,d \u2192 \u03c0K diagrams were roughly estimated as\n\u2032\n|,\n1 : |P(c)\n\n\u2032\nO(\u03bb\u0304) : |T \u2032 |, |PEW\n|,\n\n\u2032C\n\u2032\n|, |PEW\n|,\nO(\u03bb\u03042 ) : |C \u2032 |, |P(u)\n\n\u2212Adir\n(Bs0 \u2192 \u03c0 + K \u2212 )\nCP\n= 4.2 \u00b1 2.0 ,\nAdir\n(Bd0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K + )\nCP\nBR(Bd0\nBR(Bs0\n\nappears only in b \u2192 s decays but does not affect b \u2192 d\ndecays.\nThere are many NP operators which can contribute\nto b \u2192 s decays. However, it was recently shown\nin Ref. [10] that this number can be reduced considerably. At the quark level, each NP contribution to\nij,q\nthe decay B \u2192 f takes the form hf |ON\nP |Bi, where\nij,q\nON P \u223c s\u0304\u0393i b q\u0304\u0393j q (q = u, d, s, c), in which the \u0393i,j represent Lorentz structures, and color indices are suppressed. Each NP matrix element can have its own\nweak and strong phase. Now, it should be mentioned\nthat the idea of small NP strong phases can be justified [10, 11, 12]. We then further simplify our study\nby neglecting all NP strong phases. One can then\ncombine all NP matrix elements into a single NP amplitude, with a single weak phase:\nX\nij,q\nq i\u03a6q\n.\n(6)\nhf |ON\nP |Bi = A e\n\n(5)\n\nAlthough the error is still large, the two ratios are\nnearly equal. It is remarkable that the Eq. (3) is satisfied for pair #1, i.e. there is apparently no evidence\nof NP in this pair. Is the fact found in pair #1 contradictory to other clues observed in different b \u2192 s\nphenomena? We would like to emphasize that this\ncould be another interesting hint for NP.\n\n3. Implication for Bs Physics\nAs we mentioned, to date there has been no visible\ndiscrepancies with the SM in b \u2192 d decays. We follow\nthis experimental indication and assume that the NP\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u0304 \u223c 0.2. The diagrams T \u2032 and C \u2032 are the color\u2032\n\u2032\nfavored and color-suppressed trees, P(c)\nand P(u)\nare\n\u2032\n\u2032C\nthe gluonic penguins, and PEW and PEW are the colorfavored and color-suppressed electroweak penguins,\nrespectively. Especially for the ratio |C \u2032 /T \u2032 |, the\nSM predictions from different calculation approaches\nwould agree to the naive estimation of Eq. (7) [9, 14,\n15].\nPutting all diagrams together, Ref. [16] had performed a fit by using the 2006 B \u2192 \u03c0K data [3]. A\ngood fit is found, however, this fit requires |C \u2032 /T \u2032| \u223c\n1.6 \u00b1 0.3 which is much larger than the estimates of\nEq.(7). This might imply that the B \u2192 \u03c0K fit including NP amplitudes is necessary. If one ignores\nthe small O(\u03bb\u03042 ) diagrams, the B \u2192 \u03c0 i K j amplitudes\n(i, j are electric charges) can be written [11]\n\u2032C\n\n\u2032\n+A\u2032C ,d ei\u03a6d\nA+0 = \u2212P(c)\n\n\fFlavor Physics and CP Violation Conference, Taipei, 2008\n\u221a 0+\n\u2032\n\u2032C\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212T \u2032 ei\u03b3 \u2212PEW\n+A\u2032,comb ei\u03a6 \u2212A\u2032C,u ei\u03a6u\n2A = P(c)\ni\u03a6\u2032C\nu\n\n\u2032\n\u2212T \u2032 ei\u03b3 \u2212A\u2032C ,u e\nA\u2212+ = P(c)\n\u221a 00\n\u2032\n\u2032C\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212PEW\n+A\u2032,comb ei\u03a6 +A\u2032C ,d ei\u03a6d ,\n2A = \u2212P(c)\n\n(8)\n\n\u2032,comb i\u03a6\u2032\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u2032 is the SM\u2032 weak phase and A\ne\n\u2261\n\u2212A\u2032,u ei\u03a6u + A\u2032,d ei\u03a6d . It is not possible to distinguish\nthe two component amplitudes in B \u2192 \u03c0K decays.\nWe therefore denote all possible NP amplitudes in\n\u2032C\n\u2032C\n\u2032\nB \u2192 \u03c0K as A\u2032C ,u ei\u03a6u , A\u2032C ,d ei\u03a6d , and A\u2032,comb ei\u03a6 .\nThe three NP operators were then included in the\nB \u2192 \u03c0K fit in Ref. [16], one at a time. It was found\n\u2032C\n\u2032C\nthat the fit remained poor if A\u2032C ,u ei\u03a6u or A\u2032C ,d ei\u03a6d\nwas added. That is, these NP operators can be large\n\u2032C\n\u2032C\nor small. If we neglect A\u2032C ,u ei\u03a6u and A\u2032C ,d ei\u03a6d by\nassuming that they are small, a good\nfit was obtained\n\u2032\nthrough a large value of A\u2032,comb ei\u03a6 . It is worth mentioning that, if we look at the amplitude A\u2212+ describing Bd0 \u2192 \u03c0 \u2212 K + , the amplitude does not contain\n\u2032C\nNP effects because of A\u2032C ,u ei\u03a6u = 0. As be seen in\nEq. (5), the current data is consistent with the SM pre\u2032C\ndiction. It seemingly supports the idea that A\u2032C\u2032 ,u ei\u03a6u\nis small. Therefore, we expect that A\u2032,comb ei\u03a6 brings\nsizable effects into the b \u2192 s transition, while A\u2032C ,u(d)\nis less important.\nIn this case, it turns out that only the decay pair #2\ncan be significantly affected by NP. We would like to\nrepeat that this consequence is consistent with what\nwe have found in Sec. 2. The pair #2, therefore,\nshould be looked at more closely although the precise\nmeasurements of time-dependent CP asymmetries for\nthose decays would be challenging.\nBefore closing this section, we briefly refer to the Uspin implications for Bs \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 and Bs \u2192 \u03c6K\u0304 \u22170 .\nThe Bd \u2192 \u03c6K \u22170 had brought forth the polarization\npuzzle - the longitudinal and transverse components\nare roughly equal size -, which cannot be explained\nby the naive factorization calculation within the SM\n(nSM). There are a lot of studies dealing with this\npuzzle [17]. Let us now assume that the transverse\namplitude is expressed as a single dominant contribution which arises from beyond the nSM, and it is\nnonfactorizable. As long as U-spin symmetry reasonably holds among the strong decay factors of the final\nstate V V , the transverse components in pairs #4 and\n#5 can be simply given by\n|Vts | fBs0\nAT (Bs0 \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 )\n\u2248\n,\n|Vtd | fBd0\nAT (Bd0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u22170 )\n|Vts | fBd0\nAT (Bd0 \u2192 \u03c6K 0\u2217 )\n.\n\u2248\n|Vtd | fBs0\nAT (Bs0 \u2192 \u03c6K\u0304 0\u2217 )\n\n(9)\n\nBecause the final states are self-conjugate, pairs #4\nand #5 are expected to provide better results in terms\n\nof theoretical uncertainties. Consequently, one has\nfT (Bs0 \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 )\nBR(Bd0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u22170 )\n,\n\u2248\n28.4\n\u00b1\n7.2\nfT (Bd0 \u2192 K\u0304 \u22170 K \u22170 )\nBR(Bs0 \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 )\nBR(Bs0 \u2192 \u03c6K\u0304 \u22170 )\nfT (Bd0 \u2192 \u03c6K \u22170 )\n.\n\u2248\n18.8\n\u00b1\n4.8\nBR(Bd0 \u2192 \u03c6K \u22170 )\nfT (Bs0 \u2192 \u03c6K\u0304 \u22170 )\n(10)\nHowever, they might not be robust estimates since Uspin breaking in nonfactorizable contributions would\nbe more complicated and it might be large [18].\n\n4. Summary\nThere are recent intriguing studies regarding\nwhether a strong hint that implies NP in b \u2192 s transition processes would be observed. With U-spin symmetry, we speculated on the implications for Bs decays.\nTaking the fit results in Ref. [16] into account, only\none NP amplitude is found to be large. We have shown\nthat, Eq.(3) is expected to be violated by only one\ndecay pair: Bd0 \u2192 K 0 \u03c0 0 and Bs0 \u2192 K\u0304 0 \u03c0 0 .\nWe also shortly referred to the U-spin implications\nfor the polarizations of Bs \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 , \u03c6K\u0304 \u22170 . In the\nlimit of U-spin symmetry, assuming the particular scenario, the transverse components for Bs \u2192 K \u22170 K\u0304 \u22170 ,\n\u03c6K\u0304 \u22170 can be estimated with relatively less uncertainties.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis article is based on the works in collaboration with A.
