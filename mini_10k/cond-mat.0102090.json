INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Q-state Potts model [1] in two dimensions exhibits a rich variety of critical behavior\nand is very fertile ground for the analytical and numerical investigation of first- and secondorder phase transitions. With the exception of the Q = 2 Potts (Ising) model in the absence\nof an external magnetic field, exact solutions for arbitrary Q are not known. However,\nsome exact results at the critical temperature have been established for the Q-state Potts\nmodel. From the duality relation the ferromagnetic critical temperature is known to be\n\u221a\nTc = J/kB ln(1 + Q) for the isotropic square lattice. Baxter [2] calculated the free energy\nat Tc in the thermodynamic limit, and showed that the Potts model has a second-order\nphase transition for Q \u2264 4 and a first-order transition for Q > 4. The critical exponents for\nthe ferromagnetic Potts model are well known [3\u20135].\nOn the other hand, the antiferromagnetic Potts model is much less well understood than\nthe ferromagnetic model. Recently the three-state Potts antiferromagnet on the square\nlattice has attracted a good deal of interest [6\u201326]. Baxter [10] conjectured that the critical\n\u221a\npoint of the Potts antiferromagnet on the square lattice is given by Tc = J/kB ln( 4 \u2212 Q\u22121),\nand evaluated the critical free energy and internal energy. The Baxter formula for the critical\ntemperature gives the known exact value for Q = 2, a critical point at zero temperature\nfor Q = 3, and no critical point for Q > 3. For continuous Q in the range 0 < Q < 3,\nKim et al. [27] have studied the antiferromagnetic Potts critical point through the zeros\nof the partition function and found good agreement with the Baxter formula. With the\nexception of the Ising model, the critical exponents of the Potts antiferromagnets are not\nknown. However, for Q = 3 the ratio of critical exponents \u03b3/\u03bd is known to be 5/3 [16,17].\nBy introducing the concept of the zeros of the partition function in the complex magneticfield plane (Yang-Lee zeros), Yang and Lee [28] proposed a mechanism for the occurrence of\nphase transitions in the thermodynamic limit and yielded a new insight into the unsolved\nproblem of the Ising model in an arbitrary nonzero external magnetic field. It has been shown\n[28\u201330] that the distribution of the zeros of a model determines its critical behavior. Lee\n3\n\n\fand Yang [28] also formulated the celebrated circle theorem which states that the Yang-Lee\nzeros of the Ising ferromagnet lie on the unit circle in the complex magnetic-field (x = e\u03b2h )\nplane. However, for the Q-state Potts model with Q > 2 the Yang-Lee zeros lie close to,\nbut not on, the unit circle with the two exceptions of the critical point x = 1 (h = 0) itself\nand the zeros in the limit T = 0 [31].\nFisher [32] emphasized that the partition function zeros in the complex temperature\nplane (Fisher zeros) are also very useful in understanding phase transitions, and showed\nthat for the square lattice Ising model in the absence of an external magnetic field the\nFisher zeros lie on two circles in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, using the Fisher\nzeros both the ferromagnetic phase and the antiferromagnetic phase can be considered at\nthe same time. The critical behavior of the Potts model in both the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic phases have been studied using the distribution of the Fisher zeros, and\nthe Baxter conjecture for the antiferromagnetic critical temperature has been verified [27].\nRecently the Fisher zeros of the Q-state Potts model on square lattices have been studied\nextensively for integer Q > 2 [33\u201346] and noninteger Q [27]. Exact numerical studies have\nshown [27,35,36,40,41,43,44,46] that for self-dual boundary conditions the Fisher zeros of the\nQ > 1 Potts models on a finite square lattice are located on the unit circle in the complex\n\u221a\np plane for Re(p) > 0, where p = (e\u03b2J \u2212 1)/ Q. It has been analytically shown that all\nthe Fisher zeros of the infinite-state Potts model lie on the unit circle for any size of square\nlattice with self-dual boundary conditions [42], and the Fisher zeros near the ferromagnetic\ncritical point of the Q > 4 Potts models on the square lattice lie on the unit circle in the\nthermodynamic limit [45]. Chen et al. [41] conjectured that when Q reaches a certain critical\nvalue Q\u0303c (L), all Fisher zeros for L \u00d7 L square lattices with self-dual boundary conditions are\nlocated at the unit circle |p| = 1. In this paper we verify this conjecture and find that Q\u0303c (L)\napproaches infinity in the thermodynamic limit, and we study the thermal exponent yt of\nthe square-lattice Potts antiferromagnet using the Fisher zeros near the antiferromagnetic\ncritical point.\nIn this paper we also discuss the partition function zeros in the complex Q plane (Potts\n4\n\n\fzeros) of the Q-state Potts model. The Potts zeros at \u03b2J = \u2212\u221e have been investigated\nextensively to understand the ground states of the antiferromagnetic Potts model and the\nchromatic polynomial in graph theory [23,26,47\u201351]. Recently the Potts zeros at finite\ntemperatures have been studied for cyclic ladder graphs and e\u03b2J \u2264 1 [50].\nIn the next section we describe two algorithms to evaluate the density of states, from\nwhich the exact partition function of the Q-state Potts model is obtained. The first algorithm\n(microcanonical transfer matrix) is applied to only integer Q but allows us to calculate the\ndensity of states for relatively larger lattices, while the second algorithm (random-cluster\ntransfer matrix) gives the density of states for any value of Q. In Sec. III we discuss the\n\u221a\nPotts model at a = e\u03b2J = 1 \u00b1 Q, its Potts zeros, and the related properties of the Fisher\nzeros. In the subsequent two sections we study the Potts zeros for the antiferromagnetic\ninterval 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1 (Sec. IV) and for the ferromagnetic interval a \u2265 1 (Sec. V). In Sec. VI\nwe discuss the thermal exponent yt of the square lattice Q-state Potts antiferromagnet for\n2 \u2264 Q \u2264 3 using the Fisher zeros.\nII. DENSITY OF STATES\n\nThe Q-state Potts model for integer Q on a lattice G with Ns sites and Nb bonds is\ndefined by the Hamiltonian\nHQ = \u2212J\n\nX\n\n\u03b4(\u03c3i , \u03c3j ),\n\n(1)\n\nhi,ji\n\nwhere J is the coupling constant, hi, ji indicates a sum over nearest-neighbor pairs, \u03b4 is the\nKronecker delta, and \u03c3i = 1, 2, ..., Q. The partition function of the model is\nZQ =\n\nX\n\ne\u2212\u03b2HQ ,\n\n(2)\n\n{\u03c3n }\n\nwhere {\u03c3n } denotes a sum over QNs possible spin configurations and \u03b2 = (kB T )\u22121 . If we\ndefine the density of states with energy 0 \u2264 E \u2264 Nb by\n\u03a9Q (E) =\n\nX\n\n{\u03c3n }\n\n\u03b4(E \u2212\n5\n\nX\n\nhi,ji\n\n\u03b4(\u03c3i , \u03c3j )),\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhich takes on only integer values, then the partition function can be written as\nZQ (a) =\n\nNb\nX\n\n\u03a9Q (E)aE ,\n\n(4)\n\nE=0\n\nwhere a = e\u03b2J and states with E = 0 (E = Nb ) correspond to the antiferromagnetic\n(ferromagnetic) ground states. From Eq. (4) it is clear that ZQ (a) is simply a polynomial\nin a. We have calculated exact integer values for \u03a9Q=3 (E) of the three-state Potts model on\nfinite L \u00d7 L square lattices up to L = 12 using the microcanonical transfer matrix (\u03bcTM)\n[52].\nHere we describe briefly the \u03bcTM [52] on an L\u00d7N square lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions in the horizontal direction (length L) and free boundaries in the vertical direction\n(length N). First, an array, \u03c9 (1) , which is indexed by the energy E and variables \u03c3i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 L\nfor the first row of sites is initialized as\n\u03c9 (1) (E; \u03c31 , \u03c32 , ..., \u03c3L ) = \u03b4(E \u2212\n\nL\nX\n\n\u03b4(\u03c3i , \u03c3i+1 )).\n\n(5)\n\ni=1\n\nNow each spin in the row is traced over in turn, introducing a new spin variable from the\nnext row,\n\u03c9\u0303(E; \u03c31\u2032 , \u03c32 , ..., \u03c3L ) =\n\nX\n\u03c31\n\n\u03c9 (1) (E \u2212 \u03b4(\u03c31\u2032 , \u03c31 ); \u03c31 , \u03c32 , ..., \u03c3L ).\n\n(6)\n\nThis procedure is repeated until all the spins in the first row have been traced over, leaving\na new function of the L spins in the second row. The horizontal bonds connecting the spins\nin the second row are then taken into account by shifting the energy,\n\u03c9 (2) (E; \u03c31\u2032 , \u03c32\u2032 , ..., \u03c3L\u2032 ) = \u03c9\u0303(E \u2212\n\nL\nX\n\n\u2032\n\u03b4(\u03c3i\u2032 , \u03c3i+1\n); \u03c31\u2032 , \u03c32\u2032 , ..., \u03c3L\u2032 ).\n\n(7)\n\ni=1\n\nThis procedure is then applied to each row in turn until the final (Nth) row is reached. The\ndensity of states is then given by\n\u03a9Q (E) =\n\nXX\n\u03c31\u2032\n\n\u03c32\u2032\n\n...\n\nX\n\n\u03c9 (N ) (E; \u03c31\u2032 , \u03c32\u2032 , ..., \u03c3L\u2032 ).\n\n(8)\n\n\u2032\n\u03c3L\n\nThe permutation symmetry of the Q-state Potts model allows us to freeze the last spin\n\u03c3L = 1 of each row. Now we need to consider only QL\u22121 possible spin configurations in each\nrow instead of QL configurations, and we save a great amount of memory and CPU time.\n6\n\n\fOn the other hand, Fortuin and Kasteleyn [53] have shown that the partition function\nis also given by\nZ(a, Q) =\n\nX\n\nG\u2032 \u2286G\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(a \u2212 1)b(G ) Qc(G ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere the summation is taken over all subgraphs G\u2032 \u2286 G, and b(G\u2032 ) and c(G\u2032 ) are, respectively, the number of occupied bonds and clusters in G\u2032 . In Eq. (9) Q need not be an\ninteger and Eq. (9) defines the partition function of the Q-state Potts model for continuous\nQ. The random-cluster (or Fortuin-Kasteleyn) representation of the Potts model, Eq. (9),\nis also known as the Tutte dichromatic polynomial or the Whitney rank function in graph\ntheory [50,51]. Introducing the density of states indexed by the number of occupied bonds\n0 \u2264 b \u2264 Nb and the number of clusters 1 \u2264 c \u2264 Ns ,\n\u03a6(b, c) =\n\nX\nG\u2032\n\n\u03b4(b \u2212 b(G\u2032 ))\u03b4(c \u2212 c(G\u2032 )),\n\n(10)\n\nwhich also takes on only integer values, the random-cluster representation of the Potts model\ncan be written as\nZ(a, Q) =\n\nNb X\nNs\nX\n\nb=0 c=1\n\n\u03a6(b, c)(a \u2212 1)b Qc ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich is again a polynomial in a \u2212 1 and Q. We have evaluated exact integer values for\n\u03a6(b, c) on finite L\u00d7L square lattices up to L = 8 for free, cylindrical, and self-dual boundary\nconditions using the random-cluster tranfer matrix. The self-dual lattices considered in this\npaper are periodic in the horizontal direction and there is another site above the L \u00d7 L\nsquare lattice, which connects to L sites on the last (Lth) row (Figure 1).\nThe algorithm (random-cluster transfer matrix) used to obtain the density of states\n\u03a6(b, c) is similar in spirit to that of Chen and Hu [54]. We consider an L \u00d7 N square lattice\nwith periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction (length L) and free boundaries\n(m)\n\nin the vertical direction (length N). We define \u03c6L (b, c, {t}) as the density of states for the\nL\u00d7m square lattice without the horizontal bonds in the mth row as a function of the number\nof occupied bonds b = 0, 1, ..., 2L(m \u2212 1), the number of clusters c = 1, 2, ..., Lm, and the\n7\n\n\ftop labels {t} = {t1 , t2 , ..., tL } which tell whether each site in the mth row is connected to\nthe other sites in the same row.\n(2)\n\nThe first step is to calculate \u03c6L (b, c, {t}) using the Hoshen-Kopelman (HK) algorithm\n[55]. The sites in the first row are labeled 1, 2, ..., L from left to right and L + 1 to 2L in\nthe second row. Cluster labels si (i = 1, 2, ..., 2L) are determined for each site and the top\nlabel tj (j = 1, 2, ..., L) for the site j + L in the second row for each bond configuration.\nThe top label tj is the smallest number of the set of indices j = 1, 2, ..., L for the sites in the\nsecond row belonging to the same cluster which includes the site j + L. Because tj \u2264 j, the\nmaximum number of sets of top labels {t} is L!. Counting the cases si = i gives the number\nof clusters c.\n(m)\n\n(m+1)\n\nGiven \u03c6L (b, c, {t}), \u03c6L\n(m+1)\n\u03c6L\n(b, c, {t})\n\n=\n\n\u03b3X\nmax\n\nX\n\n\u03b3=1 b\u2032 ,c\u2032 ,{t\u2032 }\n\n(b, c, {t}) is calculated recursively by\n(m)\n\n\u03c6L (b\u2032 , c\u2032 , {t\u2032 })\u03b4(b \u2212 b\u2032 \u2212 bg )\u03b4(c \u2212 c\u2032 \u2212 \u2206c)\u03b4({t\u2032 } \u2192 {t}) (12)\n\nfor m = 2, 3, ..., N \u2212 1, where \u03b3 labels the 22L (= \u03b3max ) possible bond configurations in the\nnewly added piece, g, consisting of the horizontal bonds in the mth row and the vertical\nbonds between the mth row and the (m + 1)th row, and bg is the number of occupied bonds\nin g. The sites i in g are labeled from left to right by 1, 2, ..., L in the mth row and by\nL + 1, L + 2, ..., 2L in the (m + 1)th row. We again use the HK algorithm to determine the\ncluster labels {s1 , s2 , ..., s2L } and the number of clusters cg in g, and the updated old top\nlabels {t\u0303\u2032 } = {t\u0303\u20321 , t\u0303\u20322 , ..., t\u0303\u2032L } and the new top labels {t} = {t1 , t2 , ..., tL } making a comparison\nbetween the cluster labels {s1 , s2 , ..., sL } and the old top labels {t\u2032 } = {t\u20321 , t\u20322 , ..., t\u2032L }. In Eq.\n(12) \u2206c is given by the Chen-Hu formula [54]\n\u2206c = cg \u2212 n \u2212 n\u2032 + n\u2032\u2032 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere n is the number of the cluster labels satisfying si = i for i = 1, 2, ..., L, n\u2032 the number\nof the old top labels satisfying t\u2032i = i, and n\u2032\u2032 the number of the updated old top labels\nsatisfying t\u0303\u2032i = i.\nFinally, the density of states \u03a6(b, c) is obtained by\n8\n\n\f\u03a6(b, c) =\n\n\u03b3X\nmax\n\nX\n\n\u03b3=1 b\u2032 ,c\u2032 ,{t\u2032 }\n\n(N )\n\n\u03c6L (b\u2032 , c\u2032 , {t\u2032 })\u03b4(b \u2212 b\u2032 \u2212 bg )\u03b4(c \u2212 c\u2032 \u2212 \u2206c)\n\n(14)\n\nwith \u03b3max = 2L and g made up of the horizontal bonds in the last (Nth) row.\nThe random-cluster transfer matrix works very well, but for comparatively large lattices\n(N )\n\na considerable amount of memory is required to store \u03c6L (b, c, {t}). At the expense of a\nslight increase in the complexity of the code it is possible to reduce the memory requirements\nsubstantially. First, the L! sets of top labels include many unused sets, such as {..., ti =\ni, tj = i, tk = j, ...} (i < j < k), which account for 56.7 % of all sets for L = 5 and 96.8 % for\n(m)\n\nL = 10 and can be removed easily from \u03c6L (b, c, {t}). Second, we should consider the fact\n(5)\n\nthat only some range of c is used for a fixed b. For example, in \u03c65 (b, c, {t}) only c = 1 to\n11 (\u03b4c = 11) are needed for b = 24. Here c = 1 results from the sparsest distributions of 24\noccupied bonds and c = 11 from the most compact distributions. \u03b4c \u2264 11 for all b 6= 24, and\n(N )\n\n(\u03b4c)max = 11. We can calculate (\u03b4c)max easily for \u03c6L (b, c, {t}) and reduce a large amount\n(m)\n\nof memory. Third, \u03a6(b, c) can be obtained directly from \u03c6L (b\u2032 , c\u2032 , {t\u2032 }) (m \u2264 N \u2212 1)\nwith \u03b3max = 2L+2L(N \u2212m) using Eq. (14). This method decreases memory requirements but\nincreases CPU time, while the former two methods reduce both the memory and CPU time\nrequirements. In general, the random-cluster transfer matrix based on Eq. (12) is very fast,\ntaking just 30 seconds on a PC with one PENTIUM 100 MHz CPU to obtain \u03a6(b, c) on the\n5 \u00d7 5 square lattice with free boundary conditions.\nThe density of states \u03a9Q (E) is related to the density of states \u03a6(b, c) by\n\u03a9Q (E) =\n\nNb X\nNs\nX\n\nc\n\n\u03a6(b, c)Q\n\nb=E c=1\n\n!\n\nb\n(\u22121)b\u2212E\nE\n\n(15)\n\nfor integer Q. In Eq. (15) Q need not be an integer and Eq. (15) defines the density of\nstates \u03a9Q (E) of the Q-state Potts model for noninteger Q.\n\nIII. THE CRITICAL POTTS MODEL\n\nAt the ferromagnetic critical point, ac = 1 +\nPotts model becomes\n9\n\n\u221a\n\nQ, the partition function of the Q-state\n\n\fZCP =\n\nX\n\n\u03a6(b, c)\n\nb,c\n\nwhich is a polynomial in\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0012q \u0013b+2c\n\nQ\n\n,\n\n(16)\n\nQ. This defines what we refer to as the critical Potts model.\n\nSince b = Ns \u2212 1, c = 1 and b = 0, c = Ns set the lowest and highest orders, respectively, in\nthe polynomial, we can write Eq. (16) as\nZCP = w Ns +1\n\nNX\ns \u22121\n\nKr w r ,\n\n(17)\n\nr=0\n\nwhere w =\n\n\u221a\n\nQ. The coefficients Kr of the new polynomial ZCP satisfy\nNX\ns \u22121\n\nKr = 2 Nb\n\n(18)\n\nKr (\u22121)r = 0.\n\n(19)\n\nr=0\n\nand\nNX\ns \u22121\nr=0\n\nTable I shows the coefficients Kr for the 8 \u00d7 8 square lattice with free boundary conditions.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nIn addition to the ferromagnetic critical point ac = 1 + Q, the point \u0101c = 1 \u2212 Q,\nwhich is sometimes referred to the unphysical critical point, also maps into itself under the\ndual transformation (\u00e3 \u2212 1)(a \u2212 1) = Q [1]. This leads us to consider the corresponding\ncritical Potts partition function\nZ\u0304CP = w\u0304 Ns +1\n\nNX\ns \u22121\n\nKr w\u0304 r ,\n\n(20)\n\nr=0\n\nwhere w\u0304 = \u2212w. Evidently Z\u0304CP can be obtained from ZCP simply by continuing w to\nnegative values. With this understanding we consider ZCP (w) for arbitrary complex values\nof w. Note that the map of the complex w plane on to the complex Q plane is now 2-to-1.\nFigure 2 shows the Potts zeros in the complex w plane of the critical Potts model on\nan 8 \u00d7 8 square lattice with self-dual boundary conditions. The zero at w = 0 is Ns + 1\ndegenerate, and most of the remaining Ns \u2212 1 zeros lie in the half space Re(w) < 0. Several\nof these zeros lie on the negative real axis, and these will map on to the positive real Q axis\nas shown in Figure 3. Some of these zeros (Table II) lie at or close to the Beraha numbers\n[47]\n10\n\n\fBn = 4 cos2\n\n\u03c0\nn\n\n(21)\n\nwith n = 2, 3, 4, ... and 0 \u2264 Bn \u2264 4. In the study of the phase diagram of the Potts model\n\u221a\nSaleur [18] assumed that the Potts model at the unphysical critical point, \u0101c = 1 \u2212 Q, is\nsingular when Q = Bn , and our results verify this observation. Table II shows the Potts zeros\nof the critical Potts model on the L \u00d7 L square lattice which lie at or close to the Beraha\nnumbers for free (Nb = 2L2 \u2212 2L), cylindrical (2L2 \u2212 L), and self-dual (2L2 ) boundary\nconditions. As the number of bonds, Nb , increases, the number of the Potts zeros at or close\nto the Beraha numbers Bn increases for a fixed L, and as L increases the number of the\nPotts zeros at or close to Bn increases for any specified type of boundary conditions. We\nexpect that in the thermodynamic limit the Potts zeros on the positive real axis cover all\nthe Beraha numbers Bn (n = 2, 3, ...).\nFor self-dual boundary conditions there exist unexpected Potts zeros on the positive real\naxis for Q > 4 (Table III). These zeros do not exist for non-dual boundary conditions, and\nthe largest of these zeros, which we shall denote by Qmax (L), has an interesting significance.\nRecently the partition function zeros in the complex temperature plane (Fisher zeros) have\nbeen studied extensively for the Potts model [27,33\u201346]. By numerical methods it has been\nshown [27,35,36,40,41,43,44,46] that for self-dual boundary conditions the Fisher zeros of the\nQ > 1 Potts models on a finite square lattice are located on the unit circle in the complex\n\u221a\np plane for Re(p) > 0, where p = (a \u2212 1)/ Q. Chen et al. [41] conjectured that when Q\nreaches a certain critical value Q\u0303c (L), all Fisher zeros are located on the unit circle |p| = 1.\nHowever, the value of Q\u0303c (L) and how it scales with L were not addressed. We find that\nQ\u0303c (L) is identical to Qmax (L) and that Q\u0303c (L) increases with L as shown in Table III.\nFigure 4 shows the Fisher zeros in the complex p plane of the Q-state Potts model on\nthe 4 \u00d7 4 square lattice with self-dual boundary conditions. For Q = 75 the two zeros on\nthe negative real axis lie off the unit circle, while for Q = 76 all the Fisher zeros lie on the\nunit circle. At Q = Q\u0303c (= 75.37... for L = 4) the two zeros lie on p = \u22121. In general, for\nthe values of Q (both Q \u2264 4 and Q > 4) that are determined from the Potts zeros on the\n11\n\n\fpositive real axis, two Fisher zeros always lie at p = \u22121. Q = 1 is exceptional in that all\nFisher zeros of the one-state Potts model lie at p = \u22121 [41]. Note that in Figure 4(b) the\nFisher zeros are grouped and there exists a wide gap between two neighboring groups except\nfor p = \u22121. Whenever all Fisher zeros lie on the unit circle, the number of groups of zeros\nis 2Lx and the number of zeros for each group is Ly , where Lx and Ly are the lattice sizes\nin the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively.\nBy using the Bulirsch-Stoer (BST) algorithm [56] we extrapolated 1/Q\u0303c (L) for finite\nlattices to infinite size. The error estimates are twice the difference between the (n \u2212 1, 1)\nand (n\u22121, 2) approximants. For \u03c9 = 1 (the parameter of the BST algorithm) we get 1/Q\u0303c =\n0.0007(8) and 1/Q\u0303c = 0.0001(7) for \u03c9 = 2. These results imply that in the thermodynamic\nlimit all the Fisher zeros lie on the unit circle only in the limit Q \u2192 \u221e [42]. Conversely,\nthis observation implies that the locus of zeros in the thermodynamic limit for finite Q is\nan open question.\n\nIV. ANTIFERROMAGNETIC POTTS ZEROS\n\nFor antiferromagnetic interaction, J < 0, the physical interval is 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1 (0 \u2264 T \u2264 \u221e).\nAt zero temperature (a = 0) the partition function is\nZ=\n\nX\n\n\u03a6(b, c)(\u22121)b Qc ,\n\n(22)\n\nb,c\n\nwhich is also known as the chromatic polynomial in graph theory [50,51]. Figure 5 shows\nthe zeros of the chromatic polynomial in the complex Q plane for the 8 \u00d7 8 square lattice for\ncylindrical [47] and self-dual boundary conditions. In Figure 5, except for the zeros at the\nBeraha numbers 0, 1 and 2 (Q = 2.0000000000007 for cylindrical boundary conditions), the\nPotts zeros are distributed along curves which cut the positive real axis between Q = 2 and\n3. The intersection of the locus of the Potts zeros with the real axis depends on the boundary\ncondition: for L = 8 and cylindrical boundary conditions we have Q = 2.551073, while for\nself-dual boundary conditions we find a pair of zeros at Q = 2.636589 and 2.645969 which\n12\n\n\fare slightly larger than the fifth Beraha number B5 = 2.618034. For the 7\u00d77 self-dual lattice\nthese zeros lie at Q = 2.621577 and Q = 2.684634 (Figure 6). In addition for L = 7 there\nare isolated zeros on the real axis at the Beraha numbers B2 = 0, B3 = 1, and B4 = 2, and\nan additional zero appears at B6 = 3 (Figure 6). Q = 3 corresponds to the critical value Qc\n[48,49] which separates the region (Q \u2264 3) with antiferromagnetically ordered ground-states\nfrom the region (Q > 3) of disordered states at T = 0. Here we generalize this concept to\nfinite temperatures and define Qc (a) to be the value of Q for a given value of a below which\nthere is antiferromagnetic order. Because four colors are needed to color an L \u00d7 L square\nlattice with self-dual boundary conditions such that no two nearest neighbors have the same\ncolor, there exists a trivial Potts zero at Qc = 3 when L = 3, 5, 7, ... .\nFigure 6 shows the Potts zeros of the dichromatic polynomial at several temperatures\nfor the 7 \u00d7 7 lattice with self-dual boundary conditions. As a is increased the zeros move\ntoward the origin and converge on the point Q = 0 for a = 1 [50]. The antiferromagnetic\n\u221a\ncritical point is given by ac (Q) = 4 \u2212 Q \u2212 1 [10,27], from which we have\nQc (a) = (1 \u2212 a)(a + 3).\n\n(23)\n\nTable IV shows the Potts zeros Qc (L) on (L = 4, 6, 8) or closest to (L = 3, 5, 7) the positive\nreal axis for a = 0.5. From the BST extrapolation we obtained Qc = 1.78(18) (from\nL = 4, 6, 8) and Qc = 1.77(36) \u2212 0.01(3)i (from L = 3, 5, 7) in agreement with Eq. (23).\nFigure 7 compares Eq. (23) (continuous curve) with the BST estimates from Qc (a, L) for\nL = 3, 5, 7 and self-dual boundary conditions for several values of a.\n\nV. FERROMAGNETIC POTTS ZEROS\n\nFor ferromagnetic interaction, J > 0, the physical interval is a = [1, \u221e] (T = [\u221e, 0]).\nFigure 8 shows the Potts zeros of the dichromatic polynomial on L\u00d7L lattices with cylindrical\n\u221a\n\u221a\nboundary conditions for a = 1 + 2 = 2.414... and a = 1 + 3 = 2.732... . For free and selfdual boundary conditions the distribution of the Potts zeros is similar to that for cylindrical\n13\n\n\fboundary conditions. Unlike the antiferromagnetic Potts zeros which are distributed mainly\nin the Re(Q) > 0 region (Figures 5 and 6), many ferromagnetic Potts zeros lie in the\nRe(Q) < 0 region. With the exception of the trivial zero at Q = 0 the ferromagnetic Potts\nzeros are distributed along a single curve which moves away from the origin as a increases.\nThere is no zero on the positive real axis, but the zero Q1 (a, L) closest to the positive real\naxis approaches the real axis as L increases. As in the Yang-Lee theory [28], we expect\nQ1 (a, L) \u2192 Qc (a) in the limit L \u2192 \u221e. Table V shows the BST estimates from Q1 (a, L) at\n\u221a\n\u221a\na = 1 + 2 and 1 + 3 for different boundary conditions, suggesting that the locus of the\nPotts zeros cuts the positive real axis at Qc = 2 and 3, respectively, in the thermodynamic\n\u221a\nlimit. From the ferromagnetic critical point, ac (Q) = 1 + Q, we obtain\nQc (a) = (a \u2212 1)2 ,\nwhich we have confirmed for a = 1 +\n\n\u221a\n\n2 and 1 +\n\n\u221a\n\n(24)\n\n3 and other values of a > 1 (Figure 9).\n\nThe behavior of the closest zero Q1 (a, L) suggests a new scaling exponent yq defined as\nQ1 (a, L) \u2243 Qc (a) + AL\u2212yq .\n\n(25)\n\nFor finite lattices we define [27,38,39,46,52]\nyq (L) = \u2212\n\nln{Im[Q1 (L + 1)]/Im[Q1 (L)]}\n.\nln[(L + 1)/L]\n\n(26)\n\nThe exponent yq is to the Potts zeros in the complex Q plane what the thermal exponent yt\n(or the magnetic exponent yh ) is to the Fisher zeros in the complex temperature plane (the\nYang-Lee zeros in the complex magnetic-field plane). Figure 10 shows the BST estimates\n\u221a\n\u221a\nfrom yq (L) for a = 2 (Qc = 1), 1 + 2 (Qc = 2), 1 + 3 (Qc = 3), and 3 (Qc = 4).\nThe exponent yq increases as a (or Qc ) increases. Figure 10 compares our results for yq\nversus ac (Q) with the den Nijs formula [3,27] for the thermal exponent yt (ac (Q)) of the\nferromagnetic Potts model. Clearly the general behaviors of yq and yt with ac (Q) are similar;\nthese initial results are of insufficient precision to settle the question that yq = yt or not.\n\n14\n\n\fVI. FISHER ZEROS AND POTTS ANTIFERROMAGNETS\n\nFor antiferromagnetic interaction J < 0 the physical interval is 0 \u2264 a = e\u03b2J \u2264 1\n(0 \u2264 T \u2264 \u221e), which corresponds to\n\u22121\na\u22121\n\u221a \u2264 p = \u221a \u2264 0.\nQ\nQ\n\n(27)\n\nFrom the exact partition functions, Eqs. (4) and (11), we have evaluated Fisher zeros of\nthe Potts model. Figure 11 shows the Fisher zeros in the complex p plane of the three-state\nPotts model on a 12 \u00d7 12 square lattice with free boundary conditions. The Fisher zeros in\nthe complex p plane of the Q-state Potts model for several values of non-integer Q have been\nshown for the 8\u00d78 square lattice with self-dual boundary conditions [27]. Figure 12 shows the\nFisher zeros in the complex p plane of the Q = 2.5 Potts model on an 8\u00d78 square lattice with\nfree boundary conditions. In Figures 11 and 12 there is a group of complex zeros approaching\n\u221a\n\u221a\nthe antiferromagnetic critical point ac = 4 \u2212 Q \u2212 1, equivalently, pc = (ac \u2212 1)/ Q and\ncrossing the real axis at this critical point in the thermodynamic limit [27]. For an L \u00d7 L\nsquare lattice ac (L) or pc (L) denotes the closest zero to the antiferromagnetic critical point\nor edge singularity. Based on the finite-size scaling law of the partition function zeros near\nthe critical point [57,58] we expect\nIm[ac (L)] \u223c L\u2212yt ,\n\n(28)\n\nfrom which we can estimate the thermal exponent yt (L) for finite lattices as [27,38,39,46,52]\nyt (L) = \u2212\n\nln{Im[ac (L + 1)]/Im[ac (L)]}\n.\nln[(L + 1)/L]\n\n(29)\n\nTable VI shows the thermal exponents yt (L) of the Ising (Q = 2) antiferromagnet and the\nthree-state Potts antiferromagnet for free boundary conditions. By using the BST algorithm\nwe extrapolated our results for yt (L) to infinite size for 2 \u2264 Q \u2264 3. Figure 13 shows the\nthermal exponent yt of the Potts antiferromagnet by the BST estimates with \u03c9 = 1 (the\nparameter of the BST algorithm) for free boundary conditions. For the BST extrapolation\nof finite-size results of the Potts antiferromagnet we prefer free boundary condition to other\n15\n\n\fboundary conditions. The reason for this is that even though finite size effects are larger for\nfree than cylindrical boundary conditions, the edge singularity approaches the critical point\nmonotonically only if we consider a sequence of lattices with L even. For free boundary\nconditions this is not a problem and the increased effectiveness of the BST algorithm with\nlonger sequences more than compensates the stronger finite-size effects [23,27]. In Figure\n13 there are two BST estimates for Q = 3. The upper estimate resulted from data for\nL = 3 \u223c 8, while the lower one uses L = 3 \u223c 12. In Figure 13 the continuous curve is the\nfit to the BST estimates with\n1 + Au + Bu2\n,\nC + Du\n\n(30)\n\n\u221a\n2\nQ\n\u22121\nu = \u2212 cos\n,\n\u03c0\n2\n\n(31)\n\nyt =\nwhere\n\nand A = \u22122.2821, B = \u22127.4390, C = 3.9818, and D = 7.4011. The variable u arises\nnaturally in the expressions for the free energy fc (\u2212 \u03c02 u) at the ferromagnetic [2] and antiferromagnetic [10] critical temperatures, and in the critical exponents yt [3,5,27] and yh [4,5]\nof the ferromagnetic Potts model. The form used in Eq. (30) has also been used to describe\nthe critical exponent yh of the ferromagnetic Potts model [4].\nThe BST estimates of the thermal exponent yt for Q < 3 are insensitive to the parameter\nof the BST algorithm, \u03c9. However, as Q approaches 3 the BST results for the three-state\nPotts antiferromagnet are very sensitive to \u03c9. For example, we obtained yt = 0.50(8) for\n\u03c9 = 1, yt = 0.59(2) for \u03c9 = 2, and yt = 0.60(2) for \u03c9 = 3 using data for L = 3 \u223c 12.\nThe BST estimates of the thermal exponents of the Q-state Potts antiferromagnets for noninteger Q are also sensitive to \u03c9 when Q \u2248 3. Recently Ferreira and Sokal [20,24] have\nsuggested the correlation length for the three-state Potts antiferromagnet has the form\n\u03be \u223c a\u22121/yt (\u2212 ln a)r (1 + c1 a + c2 a2 + ...)\nwith yt =\n\n1\n2\n\n(32)\n\n[18,20,24], r \u2248 1, and c1 \u2248 15. For Q = 3 the sensitivity of the BST estimates\n\nof the thermal exponent to \u03c9 may result from this kind of logarithmic behavior.\n16\n\n\fFigure 14 shows the BST results extrapolated from Im[ac (L)] for L = 3 \u223c 12 of the\nthree-state Potts antiferromagnet with free boundary conditions as a function of \u03c9 along\nwith the error estimates. When we use the BST algorithm to estimate a critical point, the\nbest value of the free parameter \u03c9 is the critical exponent yt [56]. We have obtained the\ndesired result Im(ac ) = 0 for \u03c9 = 0.5 which strongly suggests yt = 0.5.\n\nVII. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have introduced the random-cluster transfer matrix to calculate exact integer values\nfor the density of states \u03a6(b, c), from which the exact partition function Z(a, Q) can be\nobtained for any value of Q, even for complex Q. We have found a subset of the zeros of the\n\u221a\npartition function of the critical Potts model in the complex w = Q plane which lie close to\nor at the Beraha numbers on the negative real axis. The largest of these determines Q\u0303c (L),\nthe value of Q above which the locus of zeros in the complex p plane lie on the unit circle.\nBy studying the scaling behavior of Q\u0303c (L) with L we find that 1/Q\u0303c (L) \u2192 0 as L \u2192 \u221e,\nindicating that all the zeros do not lie strictly on the unit circle in the thermodynamic limit.\nWe have studied the locus of zeros of the dichromatic polynomials in both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases and find that the Yang-Lee mechanism is at work in the\ncomplex Q plane. We find QAF\nc (a) = (1 \u2212 a)(a + 3) in agreement with Baxter [10,27], and\nQFc M (a) = (a \u2212 1)2 which is well known from duality arguments. Finally, we introduce a\nnew finite-size scaling exponent, yq , which describes the approach of the edge singularity in\nthe complex Q plane to the critical point as L \u2192 \u221e. We find that yq varies with Q in much\nthe same way as the thermal exponent yt of the ferromagnetic Potts model, but as yet we\nhave not established a functional relation between yt and yq .\nWe have also described the microcanonical transfer matrix to evaluate exact integer\nvalues for the density of states \u03a9Q (E) for the Q-state Potts model. From the densities\nof states \u03a6(b, c) and \u03a9Q (E) the partition functions Z(a, Q) and ZQ (a) are obtained at any\ntemperature a. Using the Fisher zeros of the exact partition functions we have estimated the\n17\n\n\fthermal exponents yt of the square-lattice Q-state Potts antiferromagnets for 2 \u2264 Q \u2264 3. For\nQ < 3 the BST estimates are quite stable and yt is well approximated by a simple algebraic\nfunction of u = \u2212 \u03c02 cos\u22121\n\n\u221a\n\nQ\n.\n2\n\nHowever, as Q approaches 3, the BST estimates become\n\nsensitive to the choice of the scaling exponent \u03c9 and to the data set used. Logarithmic\nor other corrections to scaling may be responsible for this behavior. For 3 \u2264 L \u2264 8 and\nusing the fit from data for Q < 3 we estimate yt (Q = 3) \u2243 0.60(2), whereas if we include\ncalculations for L up to 12 we find yt (3) \u2243 0.50(8), in agreement with the leading scaling\nbehavior suggested by Ferreira and Sokal [20,24]. We hope to resolve this issue by extending\nour exact calculations to larger lattices both exactly and by evaluating the density of states\nby microcanonical Monte Carlo sampling [59].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Profs.
