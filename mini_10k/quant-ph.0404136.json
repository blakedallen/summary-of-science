There are numerous papers devoted to the subject and\nwe restrict ourselves to mentioning the bibliography given in [KS99, Ku04],\nwhere also basic concepts of theory are discussed.\nThe purpose of this letter is twofold. First of all we want to draw attention\nto useful parametrization of a general coupling at graph vertices whose advantages in the present context remained so far unnoticed. Second and more\nimportant, we address the question of physical meaning of such a coupling\nand suggest an answer illustrating it on a pair of simple nontrivial examples\nof the so-called \u03b4s\u2032 and \u03b4 \u2032 couplings [Ex95, Ex96a].\nWe consider a free spinless particle on a graph, with the Hamiltonian\nwhich acts as H\u03c8j = \u2212\u03c8j\u2032\u2032 , where \u03c8j denotes the wave function at the jth\nedge. Since early times it has been known that a vertex joining n graph\nedges can be characterized by n2 real parameters [E\u016089] characterizing the\n1\n\n\fboundary condition at the vertex. We use the symbol \u03a8(0) for the column\nvector of the boundary values at the vertex (identified conventionally with\nthe origin of the coordinates), and analogously \u03a8\u2032 (0) for the vector of the\nderivatives, taken all in the outgoing direction.\nThe boundary conditions have to be chosen to make the Hamiltonian\nself-adjoint, or in physical terms, to ensure conservation of the probability\ncurrent at the vertex. A general form of such a coupling was found in [KS99].\nIt is described by a pair of n \u00d7 n matrices A, B such that rank (A, B) = n\nand AB \u2217 is self-adjoint; the boundary values have to satisfy the conditions\nA\u03a8(0) + B\u03a8\u2032 (0) = 0 .\n\n(1)\n\nThey have an advantage in comparison to earlier parameterizations relating\n\u03a8(0) and \u03a8\u2032 (0) by a single matrix, because the latter is typically singular for\na subset of parameters, albeit a zero-measure one.\nOn the other hand, the matrix pair in (1) is non-unique; one would prefer\nto have a condition analogous to \u03c8(0) cos \u03b8 + \u03c8 \u2032 (0) sin \u03b8 = 0 is case of a\nsingle edge end. Such conditions exist, they were obtained independently in\n[FT00, CFT01] for a generalized point interaction, n = 2, and in [Ha00] for\nany n \u2265 1. It is easy to\nPderive them: the self-adjointness requires vanishing\nof the boundary form, nj=1 (\u03c8\u0304j \u03c8j\u2032 \u2212 \u03c8\u0304j\u2032 \u03c8j )(0) = 0, which occurs iff the norms\nk\u03a8(0) \u00b1 il\u03a8\u2032 (0)kCn with a fixed nonzero l coincide, so the two vectors must\nbe related by an n\u00d7n unitary matrix. The length parameter is not important\nbecause matrices corresponding to two different values are related by\nU\u2032 =\n\n(l + l\u2032 )U + l \u2212 l\u2032\n.\n(l \u2212 l\u2032 )U + l + l\u2032\n\n(2)\n\nThus we set l = 1, which means a choice of the length scale, and put\nA=U \u2212I,\n\nB = i(U + I) ;\n\n(3)\n\nthe edges are obviously fully decoupled at the vertex iff U is diagonal. It is\neasy to check that any such pair satisfies the above quoted requirements from\n[KS99]. Conversely, to any A, B with these properties there is a U \u2208 U(n)\nand an invertible C such that U = C(A \u2212 iB). Indeed, such a U must satisfy\nUU \u2217 = C(BB \u2217 + AA\u2217 )C \u2217 since AB \u2217 = BA\u2217 by assumption. The matrix\nBB \u2217 + AA\u2217 is strictly positive because its null space is\nker A\u2217 \u2229 ker B \u2217 = (ran A)\u22a5 \u2229 (ran B)\u22a5 = (ran A \u222a ran B)\u22a5 = {0} .\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fIn particular, it is Hermitean so C := (BB \u2217 + AA\u2217 )\u22121/2 makes sense, it is\nHermitean and invertible.\nThe parametrization (3) simplifies various previous results. For instance,\nthe eigenspace of U with eigenvalue \u22121 gives the projection P = P1 in\n[Ku04] which makes Lemma 4 and the following claims of this paper rather\ntransparent. Likewise, the on-shell scattering matrix for a star graph of n\nhalflines with the considered coupling equals\nSU (k) =\n\n(k \u2212 1)I + (k + 1)U\n,\n(k + 1)I + (k \u2212 1)U\n\n(5)\n\nwhich makes a discussion of its properties simpler than in Sec. 2 of [KS99].\nTo give an example of the parametrization (3), denote by J the n \u00d7 n\nmatrix whose all entries are equal to one. It is a straightforward exercise to\n2\nJ \u2212 I describes the standard \u03b4 coupling,\ncheck that U = n+i\u03b1\n\u03c8j (0) = \u03c8k (0) =: \u03c8(0) , j, k = 1, . . . , n ,\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c8j\u2032 (0) = \u03b1\u03c8(0)\n\n(6)\n\nj=1\n\nwith \u03b1 \u2208 R; the case \u03b1 = 0 corresponds to the \"free motion\" at the vertex,\nso-called Kirchhoff boundary conditions, while \u03b1 = \u221e gives U = \u2212I, the full\n2\nDirichlet decoupling. In a similar way, U = I \u2212 n\u2212i\u03b2\nJ describes the singular\n\u2032\ncounterpart, so-called \u03b4s coupling [Ex95, Ex96a],\n\u03c8j\u2032 (0)\n\n=\n\n\u03c8k\u2032 (0)\n\n\u2032\n\n=: \u03c8 (0) , j, k = 1, . . . , n ,\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c8j (0) = \u03b2\u03c8 \u2032 (0)\n\n(7)\n\nj=1\n\nwith \u03b2 \u2208 R; for \u03b2 = \u221e we get U = I, the full Neumann decoupling.\nLet us mention another \"dual\" pair of vertex couplings in which the wave\nfunctions exhibit permutation symmetry. The more regular one of these is\nthe \"permuted\" \u03b4, or \u03b4p coupling, given by the boundary conditions\nn\nX\n\n\u03c8j (0) = 0 ,\n\n\u03c8j\u2032 (0) \u2212 \u03c8k\u2032 (0) =\n\nj=1\n\n\u03b1\n(\u03c8j (0) \u2212 \u03c8k (0)) , j, k = 1, . . . , n ,\nn\n\n(8)\n\nwith \u03b1 \u2208 R. It generalizes the \u03b4s interaction of [TFC01] and one can check\n2\nI \u2212 n+i\u03b1\nJ . Its couneasily that the corresponding matrix equals U = n\u2212i\u03b1\nn+i\u03b1\n\u2032\nterpart is the so-called \u03b4 coupling [Ex95, Ex96a],\nn\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03c8j\u2032 (0) = 0 ,\n\n\u03c8j (0) \u2212 \u03c8k (0) =\n\n\u03b2 \u2032\n(\u03c8 (0) \u2212 \u03c8k\u2032 (0)) , j, k = 1, . . . , n ,\nn j\n3\n\n(9)\n\n\f2\nwith \u03b2 \u2208 R, which corresponds to U = \u2212 n+i\u03b2\nI + n\u2212i\u03b2\nJ . The infinite values\nn\u2212i\u03b2\nof the parameters refer again to the Dirichlet and Neumann decoupling of\nthe graph edges, respectively.\nNote that in these four examples, the connection condition at the origin\nis totally symmetric with respect to the interchange of edge indices. Consequently, their U are constructed from symmetric matrices I and J .\nIf one wants to continue analysis of such graphs, the first question to be\nanswered is about the physical meaning and possible use of the whole family\nof such general couplings. What concerns the second part, a recent inspiration comes from the domain of quantum computing, where the generalized\npoint interactions parameterized by elements of the group U(2) have been\nproposed as an alternative realization of a qubit [CFT04]; an extension to\nhigher degree vertices opens, of course, interesting possibilities. To make use\nof them, however, one has to understand whether there is a meaningful way\nto \"construct\" vertices with different couplings.\nThe currently available results suggest that this goal cannot be achieved\nin a purely geometrical way, by squeezing a system of branching tubes with\nthe same topology as the graph. Several such approximations was analyzed\nrecently [KZ01, RS01, Sa01, EP03]; they all lead either to trivial (Kirchhoff)\nboundary conditions, or to graphs having an extended state Hilbert space\nwith extra dimensions due to the vertices. Their common feature was that\nthe transverse ground state was a constant function. Hence a nontrivial\nresults might be obtained through tubes with Dirichlet boundaries, but this\nproblem is open for a long time and notoriously difficult.\nApproximations using potentials scaled in the usual way, i.e. preserving\ntheir integrals, do yield nontrivial results [Ex96b] but only for couplings with\nwave functions continuous at the junction, which is just the family (6). This\nis not sufficient and more singular coupling need other means. Our main\naim here is to explore a natural alternative with approximating interactions\nscaled in a nonlinear way as a generalization of the procedure proposed in\n[CS98a, CS98b] and analyzed from the viewpoint of the convergence topology\nin [AN00, ENZ01]. To keep things simple we will analyze here the \u03b4s\u2032 and \u03b4 \u2032\ncouplings leaving the general case to a subsequent paper.\nConsider first the Hamiltonian H\u03b2 on the graph \u0393 consisting on n halflines\ncoupled at a single vertex by the conditions (7). Consider further the same\ngraph with additional vertices of degree two at each arm, all at the same\ndistance a > 0 from the common junction.

For simplicity the graph is featured\nas planar; the vertical bars denote the \u03b4 coupling strength.\narm; the wave functions satisfy the \u03b4 conditions (6) at the central vertex with\na coupling parameter \u03b1 = b, to be specified later, and another \u03b4 coupling (6),\nthis time with the parameter c, at each of the additional vertices \u2013 see Fig 1.\nWe call such an operator H b,c (a).\nThe crucial feature that allows us to simplify the treatment in the present\nsituation is a symmetry. Each of the Hamiltonians H\u03b2 and H b,c (a) decomposesL\ninto a nontrivial part which acts on the one-dimensional subspace of\nH = nj=1 L2 (R+ ) consisting of functions symmetric with respect to permutations, \u03c8j (x) = \u03c8k (x) for all j, k, and the (n \u2212 1)-dimensional part corresponding to Dirichlet and Neumann condition at the central vertex for the \u03b4\nand \u03b4s\u2032 coupling, respectively. Notice that the matrices U corresponding to\nthese coupling have each one simple eigenvalue and another one equal to \u22131,\nrespectively, of multiplicity n \u2212 1.\nTo see what the choice of the effective coupling constants b, c should be,\nlet us first modify to our problem the argument of [CS98a]. As we have said,\nin the nontrivial sector all the functions are the same, so we may drop the\narm index. The boundary values at x = 0 and x = a are related by\n\u03c8(a) = \u03c8(0) + a\u03c8 \u2032 (0) + O(a2 ) , \u03c8 \u2032 (a\u2212) = \u03c8 \u2032 (0+) + O(a) ,\n5\n\n(10)\n\n\f\u03c8 \u2032 (a+) = \u03c8 \u2032 (a\u2212) + c\u03c8(a) , \u03c8 \u2032 (0+) = b\u03c8(0) .\n\n(11)\n\nEliminating \u03c8(0) and \u03c8 \u2032 (0+) from here, we get in the leading order the\nrelation B(a)\u03c8(a) = \u03c8 \u2032 (a+), where\nB(a) := c +\n\nb\n;\n1 + ab\n\n(12)\n\nhence the needed limit, \u03b2\u03c8 \u2032(0+) = n\u03c8(0), is achieved as a \u2192 0+ if we choose\nb(a) := \u2212\n\n\u03b2\n,\nna2\n\n1\nc(a) := \u2212 .\na\n\n(13)\n\nIn the orthogonal complement to the permutation-symmetric subspace one\nwe can again drop the index, P\nbecause the operators act in the same way on\nall the linear combinationsPof nj=1 dj \u03c8j (x) which we can choose as the basis\nhere, i.e. those satisfying nj=1 dj = 0. The second one of the conditions (11)\nis now replaced by \u03c8(0) = 0. Eliminating then the boundary values at x = 0\nwe get in the leading order the relation \u03c8 \u2032 (a+) = (c + a\u22121 )\u03c8(a) + O(a). The\nright-hand side vanishes with the parameter choice (13), giving Neumann\ncondition, \u03c8 \u2032 (0+) = 0, in the limit.\nNow we can state and prove our main result.\nTheorem 1 H b,c (a) \u2192 H\u03b2 as a \u2192 0+ in the norm-resolvent sense provided\nthe coupling constants b, c are chosen in correspondence with (13).\nProof: By the same symmetry argument as above we can again reduce the\nproblem to investigation of a pair of halfline problems. Let us start with the\none having Dirichlet condition at the origin, so the free Green's function at\nenergy k 2 is\nsin kx< ikx>\ne\n,\n(14)\nGk (x, y) =\nk\nwhere as usual x< is the smaller one of the values x, y and vice versa. The\nGreen's function of the operator with the \u03b4 interaction at x = a is obtained\neasily by Krein's formula [AGHH, Appendix A]\nGck (x, y) = Gk (x, y) +\n\nGk (x, a)Gk (a, y)\n.\n\u2212c\u22121 \u2212 Gk (a, a)\n\n(15)\n\nOn the other hand, the Green's function referring to Neumann boundary is\nGN\nk (x, y) =\n\ncos kx< ikx>\ne\n;\nk\n6\n\n(16)\n\n\four aim is to show that the last two converge to each other for some k 2 \u2208 C.\nIt is convenient to choose k = i\u03ba with \u03ba > 0; we will see below that the\ndenominator of the last term at the right-hand side of (15) is then nonzero for\na small enough. Since the functions involved are uniformly bounded around\nzero, it is sufficient to compute the difference in the case when neither of\nthe arguments is smaller than a. For the sake of definiteness suppose that\na \u2264 x \u2264 y; then (15) and (16) give\n\u0014\n\u0015\ne\u2212\u03bax e\u2212\u03bay\nsinh2 \u03baa\nc\nN\nGi\u03ba (x, y) \u2212 Gi\u03ba (x, y) =\n\u22121 +\n.\n(17)\n\u03ba\n\u2212\u03bac\u22121 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bax sinh2 \u03baa\nIf c = \u2212a\u22121 the last term behaves as 1 + O(a) for a \u2192 0+, so\nlim Gci\u03ba (x, y) = GN\ni\u03ba (x, y)\n\n(18)\n\na\u21920+\n\nholds for all x, y > 0.\nConsider next the case with the \u03b4 coupling at the origin using the same\nparameter values, namely k = i\u03ba and a \u2264 x \u2264 y. We are interested in the\nfollowing two Green's functions,\ne\u2212\u03bay\n(b sinh \u03bax + \u03ba cosh \u03bax) ,\n\u03ba(b + \u03ba)\ne\u2212\u03bay\nG\u03b2i\u03ba (x, y) =\n(n sinh \u03bax + \u03b2\u03ba cosh \u03bax) ,\n\u03ba(n + \u03b2\u03ba)\nGbi\u03ba (x, y) =\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\nwhich replace (14) and (16), respectively, in the present case. The first of\nthem determines the full approximating Green's function by Krein's formula,\nb\nGb,c\nk (x, y) = Gk (x, y) +\n\nGbk (x, a)Gbk (a, y\n.\n\u2212c\u22121 \u2212 Gbk (a, a)\n\n(21)\n\nUsing the relations (13) we express the difference\n\u0014\ne\u2212\u03bay b sinh \u03bax + \u03ba cosh \u03bax\nb,c\n\u03b2\nGi\u03ba (x, y) \u2212 Gi\u03ba (x, y) =\n\u03ba\nb+\u03ba\ne\u2212\u03bax\n(b sinh \u03bax + \u03ba cosh \u03bax)2\n(b+\u03ba)2\n+\n\u2212\u03baa\n\u03baa \u2212 eb+\u03ba (b sinh \u03bax + \u03ba cosh \u03bax)\n\nn sinh \u03bax + \u03b2\u03ba cosh \u03bax\n\u2212\nn + \u03b2\u03ba\n\n\u0015\n\n(22)\n\nThe first term in the bracket tends to sinh \u03bax as a \u2192 0+, while the third one\nis independent of a, so their sum in the limit gives\n\u2212\n\n\u03b2\u03ba e\u2212\u03bax\n.\nn + \u03b2\u03ba\n7\n\n(23)\n\n\fNext we take the middle term without the factor e\u2212\u03bax and expand the numerator and denominator to the second power in a; this gives its limit which\ndiffers just by the sign from (23), in other words\n\u03b2\nlim Gb,c\ni\u03ba (x, y) = Gi\u03ba (x, y)\n\na\u21920+\n\n(24)\n\nholds again for all x, y > 0. To conclude the proof we have just to realize\nthat as functions of x, y the differences (17) and (22) decay exponentially, so\nthe corresponding resolvent differences converge to zero even in the HilbertSchmidt norm. \u0003\nLet us add that the proven result opens way to approximation of H\u03b2 by\nHamiltonians with more regular interactions. We have mentioned that the\ncentral \u03b4 in H b,c (a) can be approximated by a family of potentials scaled in\nthe usual way, the same is true for the \u03b4 interactions at the points xj = a. As\nin the related problem discussed in [ENZ01], the question then is how fast\nhave these approximating potentials to shrink with respect to a.\nConsider finally the case of \u03b4 \u2032 coupling, i.e. the Hamiltonian H\u0303\u03b2 on our\nstar graph with the boundary conditions (9) at the vertex. The approximating family will be constructed in a similar way as above; the difference is that\nnow the wave functions will satisfy the \u03b4p conditions (8) at the central vertex\nwith a coupling parameter \u03b1 = b, to be specified. The rest is the same, there\nis another \u03b4 coupling (6) with the parameter called again c at each of the\nadditional vertices; we denote such an operator H\u0303 b,c (a).\nTo realize that this problem can be again reduced to a one-dimensional\nanalysis, denote \u03b5 := e2\u03c0i/n and introduce\n\b\nGr := (\u03c8(x), \u03b5r \u03c8(x), . . . , \u03b5r(n\u22121) \u03c8(x)) : \u03c8 \u2208 L2 (R+ ) .\n(25)\nLn\u22121\nThe graph state Hilbert space can be written as H = r=0\nGr . Indeed, any\nvector of H is a unique linear combination of the vectors from Gr , because\nthe determinant of the corresponding linear system is the Vandermond determinant of 1, \u03b5, . . . , \u03b5n\u22121 , which is nonzero because the latter are mutually\ndifferent. It is straightforward to see that the subspaces Gr are invariant under the Hamiltonians in question; the \u03b4p and \u03b4 \u2032 couplings acts \"trivially\" at\nthe origin corresponding to Dirichlet and Neumann condition, respectively,\nwhile on each of the subspaces Gr , r = 1, . . . , n, these boundary conditions\nare replaced by \u03c8 \u2032 (0) = \u03b1n \u03c8(0) and \u03c8(0) = \u03b2n \u03c8 \u2032 (0). Thus we can choose\nb(a) := \u2212\n\n1\nc(a) := \u2212 ,\na\n\n\u03b2\n,\na2\n8\n\n(26)\n\n\fand repeat the above considerations, arriving at the following conclusion.\nTheorem 2 H\u0303 b,c (a) \u2192 H\u0303\u03b2 holds in the norm-resolvent sense as a \u2192 0+ if\nthe coupling constant families b, c are given by (26).\n\nAcknowledgments\nP.E. appreciates the hospitality extended to him at the Kochi University\nof Technology where a part of this work was done.
