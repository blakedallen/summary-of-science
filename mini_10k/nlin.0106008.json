In such cases it is important to\nconsider the effects of this irregularity at microscopical level onto the macroscopic behavior of the\nmedium. We show that the macroscopic field produced by a large group of chaotic scatterers can\nremain regular, due to the partial or complete phase coherence of the scattering elements and the\nincoherence of the chaotic components of their responses. Thus when only macroscopic fields are\nobserved, one may be unaware of chaotic microscopical motion, as it appears to be hidden from\nthe observer. The coupling among the elements may lead to partial chaos synchronization, which\nexposes the chaotic nature of the system making the oscillations of macroscopic fields more irregular.\n\nThe problem of wave scattering and dispersion is one\nof the basic problems in many branches of physics. In\nmost physical problems scattering and dispersion are explained by the interaction of the wave field with particles\nthat respond linearly or weakly nonlinearly to the external forcing. However over the last few years problems\nappeared where external fields are so powerful that they\ndrive the individual scatterers into the chaotic regime.\nExamples of such problems are the chaotic excitation of\natoms and molecules by powerful electro-magnetic fields\n[1] and chaotic pulsations of cavitating bubbles in powerful ultrasonic fields [2]. In such cases the problem of scattering and dispersion becomes more complicated. Even\nif the behavior of a microscopic element is chaotic, it is\nnot obvious what manifestation this would have at the\nmacroscopic level. The study of this issue is important\nfrom both theoretical and experimental prospectives.\nScattering elements can typically be considered as passive damped oscillators. When the amplitude of the scattered field is small compared to the external field, the\neffect of the scattered field upon an individual element is\nnegligible and the whole system becomes an ensemble of\nuncoupled damped oscillators driven by the same external force. Beyond some amplitude level the nonlinearity\nof the scatterers becomes essential and can lead to chaotization of their oscillations. In many cases chaotic oscillations occurring in a single damped oscillator under the\naction of a periodic external force turn out to be in some\nsense phase locked to the driving force [3]. As the result,\nchaotic oscillations in such systems contain components\nthat are coherent with the external driving. If the macroscopic field is produced by a large group of such microscopic elements, these components add coherently, while\nthe chaotic components of signals add non-coherently.\nThe resulting macroscopic field becomes nearly periodic.\nWhen the coupling through the scattered field is taken\ninto account, an unusual situation occurs. Sufficiently\nstrong coupling can lead to partial or complete synchronization of chaotic oscillations in individual elements [4].\nIn such case chaotic components of these oscillations begin to add coherently and the macroscopic field becomes\nmore chaotic. Thus the synchronization phenomenon,\n\nwhich is normally associated with the onset of a more\nregular behavior in the system, has the opposite effect\non the observed macroscopic quantities, making their oscillations less regular.\nTo better understand this phenomenon, let us consider\nas an example the following system:\nN\nX\n\u03bai,j dxi\ndxj\n1\n\u03b1\nd2 xj\n+\n\u03bd\n+\n=\nA\nsin(\u03a9t)\n+\n\u2212\n. (1)\ndt2\ndt\nx3j\nx2j\nN dt\ni=1\n\nThese equations describe damped motion of N particles in the potential U (x) = \u03b1/(2x2 ) \u2212 1/x and subject to the periodic external force. The last term is to\naccount for possible synchronization effects due to the\nmutual coupling through the macroscopic field. Here we\nassume for simplicity that the scattering region is much\nsmaller than the wavelength of the external field and neglect the delays in the coupling term. The values of the\ncoupling coefficients depend on the geometry of the problem. We consider the case where the scattered field is\nproportional to the derivative of the state of a scattering\nelement, yj (t) = dxj (t)/dt. In the following discussion\nwe shall keep \u03bd = 0.4, \u03b1 = 0.75, A = 0.45, and \u03a9 = 1.3.\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\ny(t)\n\narXiv:nlin/0106008v1 [nlin.CD] 7 Jun 2001\n\nInstitute for Nonlinear Science, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0402\n\n0\n\n\u22120.4\n\n\u22120.8\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\nx(t)\n\n1.6\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1.

System (1) with zero coupling belongs to the class of two-dimensional systems with periodic forcing, dx/dt = F(x, t), where x \u2208 R2 and\nF(x, t) = F(x, t + T ), with strictly negative divergence\nof the vector field x: divF(x, t) < 0 for any x. By Liouville's formula it can be shown that for such systems the\nPoincare map x(t) \u2192 x(t + T ) is area-contracting and\ntherefore cannot contain invariant circles [6]. For the\nnon-autonomous system x(t) this means that it cannot\nposses quasiperiodic motions corresponding to trajectories on invariant tori. All motions in this system are\neither periodic motions phase locked with the external\nforcing or chaotic motions. If present, chaotic trajectories will wonder in the vicinity of the skeleton composed\nof periodic orbits, which are phase locked to the driving\nforce [7]. The effect of this phase locking can be seen if\nwe introduce the phase of chaotic oscillations as the angle variable in the angle-amplitude representation of the\nHilbert transform, hj (t) [8]:\nZ \u221e\nyj (\u03c4 )\ni\nd\u03c4,\nhj (t) = yj (t) + P.V.\n\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e \u03c4 \u2212 t\n\nand the power spectral density can be written as\nP (\u03c9) = N (P1 (\u03c9) \u2212 PX (\u03c9)) + N 2 PX (\u03c9),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P1 (\u03c9) is the power spectral density of a single response, and PX (\u03c9) is the cross spectral density.\nThe autocorrelation, C0 (\u03c4 ), the cross-correlation\nCX (\u03c4 ) and the difference between the two, CC (\u03c4 ) =\nC0 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 CX (\u03c4 ) are shown in Fig.2. We see that CC (\u03c4 )\ndecays at large |\u03c4 |, which means that P1 (\u03c9) \u2212 PX (\u03c9) is\nthe continuous component of the power spectrum. More\ninterestingly, we observe that CX (\u03c4 ) is a purely periodic\nfunction, meaning PX (\u03c9) is the discrete component of\nthe spectrum.\nEquation 2 indicates that as the number of scattering elements increases, the coherent component of the\nspectrum increases quadratically with the number of elements, while the continuous spectrum component increases linearly, as it typically happens with non-coherent\nsignals. Therefore, with a large number of chaotic microscopic elements, the macroscopic response of the system\nis highly regular, nearly periodic. Thus the chaotic nature of the system is hidden from the macroscopic observer. This is illustrated in Fig.3 and Fig.4. The faster\ngrowth of the discrete spectral component, compared to\nthe continuous chaotic component, is evident in Fig.4. A\ncloser look at a proper projection of this figure reveals\ngood agreement with the prediction of (2): the slope for\n\nThe phase mismatch between the response and the\ndriving force, \u03a6j (t) = \u03c6j (t) \u2212 \u03a9t, is shown in Fig.5.\nWe observe that max(\u03a6j (t)) \u2212 minj (\u03a6(t)) < \u03c0. Thus\nthe chaotic response oscillations are loosely phase locked\n2\n\n\fwith the periodic driving and the fluctuations of the relative phase are less than half-a-period. Due to this, the\ncross-correlation of two oscillators driven by the same external field is purely periodic because the effect of chaos\naverages to zero, while the component coherent with the\nperiodic driving does not. When \u03c4 is large, due to the\ndivergence of trajectories in the phase space of chaotic\nsystems and the loss of information about the initial condition, the difference between computing autocorrelation\nfor a single oscillator and computing cross-correlation for\nsignals from two different oscillators disappears. This\nexplains why C0 (\u03c4 ) becomes purely periodic, and CC (\u03c4 )\ndecays to zero, see Fig.2.\n\nPhase\n\n\u03c0/2\n0.00\n\n\u2212\u03c0/2\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nTime\nFIG. 5.

The solid line corresponds to increasing the coupling coefficient from zero, the\ndashed line, to decreasing it.\n\nNot quite so obvious is the effect of weak synchronizing\ncoupling. When the coupling is weak, the state of complete synchronization may not be achieved. To make the\nmatter more complicated, the variations of coupling lead\nto changing dynamics of the entire systems. In addition\nto chaotic attractors for some values of coupling periodic\nor quasiperiodic stated can become stable. Nevertheless,\nthe de-regularizing effects can be seen even for very small\nvalues of the coupling. This is illustrated in Fig.6 which\nshows the ratio of the power in the continuous component of the spectrum to the total power as a function of\ncoupling. We see that for weak coupling we observe a\nsharp transition from a very regular state where most of\nthe power is in the periodic components to a less regular\nstate with a significant power in the continuous part of\nthe spectrum. A hysteresis is observed near the transition\npoint. As the coupling increases further, the dynamics of\nthe system changes and the mean field response becomes\nmore regular again.

If the coupling among the elements is suffi-\n\n3\n\n\fof two oscillators looks almost identical to the autocorrelation of a single oscillator, and the oscillations become\nquite irregular.\nIn conclusion, we showed that when the only observed\nquantities are obtained by averaging the responses from\nmany chaotic oscillators to external fields, these quantities can remain periodic. This presents a difficulty in\nobserving chaos in such systems. Fig.7 illustrates the\neffect of averaging onto the bifurcation diagram of our\nexample system. We see that the period doubling cascade and the chaotic regime, evident in the bifurcation\ndiagram of a single element, are hardly visible in the bifurcation diagram of the mean field. Under experimental\nconditions the bifurcation sequence and the transition to\nchaos can easily be obscured by measurement noise [9].\nThe macroscopic chaotic oscillations may arise in such\nsystems as a result of mutual coupling between the elements. When this coupling is strong chaotic oscillations\nin individual elements may become synchronized, which\ncauses non-periodic components of individual responses\nadd coherently. As the coupling strength varied, the transition between regimes characterized by different degrees\nof regularity of the mean field response can occur in a\nnon-trivial way, for example, exhibit hysteresis.\n\n[1] G.
