These systems consist of a white dwarf accreting\nmatter via a helium accretion disc from a significantly less\nmassive and hydrogen deficient donor star. In order to fit\nwithin the Roche lobe it is necessary for this donor to\nalso be at least partially degenerate. AM CVn stars ofc 0000 RAS\n\nfer new insights into the formation and evolution of binary star systems, with the short periods implying at\nleast one common envelope phase in the history of the binary, and the chemical composition suggesting helium white\ndwarfs or CVs with evolved secondaries as possible progenitors (Nelemans et al. 2001, 2010, see also Marsh et al.\n2010; Kulkarni & van Kerkwijk 2010 for the recent identification of a possible AM CVn progenitor). Close doubledegenerate binaries are also one of the proposed progenitor\npopulations of Type Ia supernovae (Tutukov & Yungelson\n1981; Webbink 1984; Iben & Tutukov 1984) and sublumi-\n\n\f2\n\nC.M. Copperwheat et al.\n\nnous events (Perets et al. 2010). Finally, the mass transfer in\nthese systems is thought to be driven by angular momentum\nloss as a result of gravitational radiation. Due to their very\nshort periods they are predicted to be among the strongest\ngravitational wave sources in the sky (Nelemans et al. 2004),\nand are the only class of binary with examples already\nknown which will be detectable by the gravitational wave\nobservatory LISA (Stroeer & Vecchio 2006; Roelofs et al.\n2007).\nGravitational radiation has a huge influence on AM\nCVn systems, driving their evolution and determining their\norbital period distribution, luminosities and numbers. Degenerate stars expand upon mass loss and so stable mass\ntransfer via Roche lobe overflow causes an evolution towards\nlonger periods. The combination of decreasing donor mass\nand lengthening orbital period leads to a rapid decrease in\nthe magnitude of the gravitational wave losses over time.\nThere is therefore a significant drop in the mass transfer\nrate over the observed period range of the AM CVn population (Nelemans et al. 2001). If the donor stars in AM CVn\nstars were completely degenerate then their masses would\nbe a unique function of orbital period, and their mass transfer rates a function of the accretor mass and orbital period.\nHowever, the three current paradigms for the binary formation path (white dwarf mergers, Nelemans et al. 2001;\nex-helium stars, Iben & Tutukov 1991; CVs with evolved\ndonors, Podsiadlowski et al. 2003) all imply partial degeneracy, to different degrees. A partially degenerate star must be\nmore massive than a degenerate star to fit within a Roche\nlobe at a given orbital period. A less degenerate donor therefore implies higher gravitational wave losses and a higher\nmass transfer rate. A test of the degeneracy of the donor star\nrequires accurate mass determinations which have proved\nelusive, although some constraints were obtained for five\nsystems using parallax measurements obtained with HST\n(Roelofs et al. 2007).\nThe prototype AM CVn system was discovered 40\nyears ago (Smak 1967; Paczy\u0144ski 1967), but to date only\n\u223c25 further objects of this class have been discovered\n(see, e.g., Roelofs et al. 2005; Anderson et al. 2005, 2008;\nRoelofs et al. 2009; Rau et al. 2010). One of these was the\neclipsing system SDSS J0926+3624 (Anderson et al. 2005,\nSDSS 0926 hereafter). SDSS 0926 is currently the only\neclipsing AM CVn known, and has a period of 28 min, with\neclipses lasting \u223c1 min. The mean g-band magnitude of this\nsystem is \u223c19.3 (Anderson et al. 2005), but there is considerable out-of-eclipse variation, characteristic of the superhumping behaviour seen in many AM CVns and CVs which\nis attributed to the precession of an elliptical accretion disc\n(Whitehurst 1988; Lubow 1991; Simpson & Wood 1998).\nIn 2006 and 2009 we took high time resolution observations of SDSS 0926 with the fast CCD camera ULTRACAM. The aim of these observations was to determine precise system parameters for this system, using techniques we\nhave in the past successfully applied to normal CVs (e.g.,\nFeline et al. 2004; Littlefair et al. 2008; Pyrzas et al. 2009;\nSouthworth et al. 2009; Copperwheat et al. 2010). Precise\nmasses enable us to determine the degree of degeneracy of\nthe donor star, and eclipse timings can be used to determine\nthe angular momentum losses. We present these photometric observations in this paper, as well as additional data\n\ncollected with the Liverpool Telescope, XMM-Newton and\nthe Catalina Sky Survey.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nOBSERVATIONS\nWHT/ULTRACAM\n\nIn 2006 and 2009 observations of SDSS 0926 were made with\nthe high speed CCD camera ULTRACAM (Dhillon et al.\n2007) mounted on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope\n(WHT). The 2006 observations were mainly taken over a\nthree day period in the beginning of March. Weather conditions were reasonable, with seeing \u223c1\" and good transparency. The 2009 observations were taken over three nights\nin January, and conditions for these winter observations were\non the whole poorer, with variable seeing and transparency.\nDue to conditions, only a small number of orbital cycles\nwere observed on two of the three nights. ULTRACAM is\na triple beam camera and all observations were made using\nthe SDSS u\u2032 , g \u2032 and r \u2032 filters. Average exposure times were\n\u223c3s in 2006 and 1.8s in 2009. The longer exposure time was\nnecessary for the 2006 observations due to the relatively low\nS/N of the u\u2032 -band data. Our 2009 observations took advantage of a new feature in the ULTRACAM software, in which\nmultiple u\u2032 -band exposures can be coadded on the CCD before readout. Two coadds were used for the majority of the\ndata, giving a u\u2032 -band exposure time of 3.6s, although this\nwas increased during poor conditions. The dead time between exposures for ULTRACAM is \u223c25ms. The CCD was\nwindowed in order to achieve this exposure time. A 2 \u00d7 2\nbinning was used in most of the 2006 observations to compensate for conditions. A complete log of the observations\nis given in Table 1.\nAll of these data were reduced with aperture photometry using the ULTRACAM pipeline software, with debiassing, flatfielding and sky background subtraction performed in the standard way. The source flux was determined using a variable aperture (whereby the radius of the\naperture is scaled according to the FWHM). Variations in\ntransparency were accounted for by dividing the source light\ncurve by the light curve of a nearby comparision star. The\nstability of this comparison star was checked against other\nstars in the field, and no variations were seen. We determined\natmospheric absorption coefficients in the u\u2032 , g \u2032 and r \u2032 bands\nand subsequently determined the absolute flux of our targets using observations of standard stars (from Smith et al.\n2002) taken in evening twilight. We used this calibration for\nour determination of the apparent magnitudes of the source,\nalthough we present all light curves in flux units determined\nusing the conversion given in Smith et al. (2002). Using our\nabsorption coefficients, we extrapolate all fluxes to an airmass of 0. For all data we convert the MJD (UTC) times\nto the barycentric dynamical timescale, correcting for light\ntravel times.\n\n2.2\n\nLT/RISE\n\nWe supplemented our WHT/ULTRACAM data with additional observations taken through the first half of 2009 with\nthe high speed RISE camera (Steele et al. 2008) mounted\non the Liverpool Telescope.

Each observation was 1h in length (except the observation on 30\nMarch, which was twice as long) with exposure times of\n30s. The purpose of these observations was to characterise\nthe superhump, since this exposure time is too long to adequately sample the eclipse. We reduced these data using\naperture photometry as with the WHT/ULTRACAM data,\nusing the ULTRACAM pipeline software.\n2.3\n\nXMM-NEWTON\n\nSDSS 0926 was observed with XMM-Newton on 23 November 2006. It was observed for 34.0 ksec in the EPIC pn detector and 35.7 ksec in the EPIC MOS detectors. It was\ndetected with a mean count rate of 0.033\u00b10.001 ct/s in the\nEPIC pn and 0.021\u00b10.008 ct/s in the EPIC MOS (1+2), but\nwas too faint in X-rays to be detected in the RGS detectors.\nThe particle/X-ray background was low during the course of\nthe observation. The Optical Monitor (OM) was configured\nin fast-mode and the observation time was split between the\nUVW1 (2450\u20133200\u00c5) and UVM2 (2050\u20132450\u00c5) filters. The\nsource was detected with a mean count rate of 0.68 ct/s in\nUVW1 and 0.24 ct/s in UVM2.\nThe X-ray data were processed using the XMM-Newton\nScience Analysis Software (SAS) v9.0. For the EPIC detec\u2032\u2032\ntors, data were extracted using an aperture of 30 centered\non the source position. Background data were extracted\nfrom a source free region. The background data were scaled\nand subtracted from the source data. The OM data were\nreduced using omfchain.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n21\n20\n10\n11\n\n2.4\n\nEPIC MOS & RGS detectors\nEPIC pn detector\nOptical Monitor, fast mode with UVW1 filter\nOptical Monitor, fast mode with UVM2 filter\n\nThe Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey\n\nThe Catalina Sky Survey (Larson et al. 1998) is a search for\nnear-Earth objects using the 0.7m f /1.9 Catalina Schmidt\nTelescope north of Tucson, Arizona. This survey uses a single unfiltered 4k \u00d7 4k CCD with 2.5\" pixels, giving an 8\ndeg2 field of view. The Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS; Drake et al. 2009) began analysing these data\nin real-time in November 2007 for optical transients.\nThe CRTS dataset contains 202 separate observations\nof SDSS 0926 between 10 November 2004 and 11 June 2010.\nEach observation is 30s in length, and they are divided up\ninto groups of (typically) 4 observations taken over a \u223c30\nmin period.

We omit from this plot the short section of data collected\non 5th March 2006.\nIf we first examine the 2006 data, it is apparent that\nthere are gross differences in the light curve from night to\nnight. The shape of the eclipse features remains the same,\nbut the superhump precesses through the light curve, and\n\n\f4\n\nC.M.

For clarity we apply offsets of 0.05mJy to the g \u2032 -band data and 0.1mJy\nto the u\u2032 -band data. The gaps in the first night of data are due to poor weather conditions.\n\nso we see the peak of the superhump emission at different\nphases on different nights. On 1 March the peak of the superhump is soon after the eclipse. On 2 March it is shortly\nbefore the eclipse, and on 3 March it is not immediately\napparent, but the shape of the light curve before and after the eclipse suggests that the superhump and the eclipse\nare approximately superimposed. If we examine the eclipse\nfeature itself, we see that the primary eclipse is immediately followed by a distinct second, smaller eclipse (this is\nmost apparent in the 3 March data). We will show in Section 4.2 that these two eclipses are of the white dwarf and\nthe bright spot, respectively. The eclipses are preceded by a\nsmall orbital 'hump' caused by the bright spot moving into\nthe field of view. This is not immediately apparent since the\nbright spot is relatively weak in these data, so the out-ofeclipse variation is dominated by the superhump. As well\nas the superhump and eclipse features we see the stochastic 'flickering' variation that is characteristic of accreting\n\nsources. This variation is mitigated to some degree in the\nphase-folded lightcurves (Figure 3). Following Smith et al.\n(2002) we find the mean magnitudes outside of eclipse to be\n19.05 \u00b1 0.10, 19.24 \u00b1 0.07 and 19.39 \u00b1 0.08 in u\u2032 , g \u2032 and r \u2032\nrespectively.\nIn contrast to 2006, in the 2009 data the shape of the\nout-of-eclipse light curve is roughly constant from night to\nnight: we do not see the large variations caused by a superhump component precessing through the light curve. The\nshape of the light curve on all three nights is most similar to\nthe 2 March 2006 data, with the peak of the emission shortly\nbefore the eclipse. Since the position of this peak does not\nvary from night-to-night it is most likely due to the bright\nspot, and thus there seems to be no significant superhump\ncontribution in these data. The mean magnitudes outside of\neclipse are 18.94 \u00b1 0.13, 19.31 \u00b1 0.07 and 19.43 \u00b1 0.11 in u\u2032 ,\ng \u2032 and r \u2032 respectively, consistent with the 2006 values. Note\nalso that the out-of-eclipse variation is double-humped, with\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSDSS J0926+3624: The shortest period eclipsing binary star\n0.25\n\n5\n\n1st January 2009\n\n0.2\n\nu'\n\n0.15\n\ng'\n\n0.1\nr'\n\n0.05\n0\n0.25\n\n2nd January 2009\n\nmJy\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0.25\n\n3rd January 2009\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nTime (h)\n\nFigure 2.

All data were collected simultaneously in the\nu\u2032 - (top, blue), g \u2032 - (middle, green) and r \u2032 -bands (bottom, red). For clarity we apply offsets of 0.05mJy to the g \u2032 -band data and 0.1mJy\nto the u\u2032 -band data. The gaps in the first night of data are due to poor weather conditions and a hardware fault.\n\na peak at a phase of \u223c0.3 as well as the main peak at \u223c0.8.\nThe most likely explanation for this is that bright spot is vertically extended, or disc is optically thin, so we are seeing\nemission from the bright spot all the way round the orbit.\n3.2\n\nNon-orbital variability in the ULTRACAM\ndata\n\nIn Section 4 we use the high time resolution ULTRACAM\ndata to make precise parameter determinations. However,\nfirst it is necessary to examine the non-orbital variability in this system. We begin by examining quasi-periodic\nvariability in the ULTRACAM data. Secondly, it is important to characterise the superhumps present in the 2006\nobservations, so these features can be subtracted from the\nlightcurves.\n3.2.1\n\nfor each of the first three 2006 nights separately and we\ndetected this signal every night. The signal is high in the g \u2032 band, and is barely detected in the u\u2032 band. There is possibly\na signal at the lower frequency of \u223c1400 cycles/day in the\n2009 data, but it is much weaker than the 2006 signal. We\ndid not find any signals in the periodograms at higher frequencies beyond the 5000 cycles/day range plotted in Figure\n4.\nSimilar quasi-coherent variability was first observed\nin CVs some decades ago (Warner & Robinson 1972;\nPatterson et al. 1977), and has since been observed in many\nCVs and X-ray binaries (see Warner & Woudt 2008 for a\nrecent review). The peak period of the signal we detect in\nthe 2006 data is low for a QPO, but this may be due to the\nfact that the accretion disc in an ultracompact binary such\nas SDSS 0926 is much smaller and less massive than the disc\nin conventional CV systems.\n\nQuasi-coherent variability\n\nIn Figure 4 we plot Lomb-Scargle periodograms (Press 2002)\nfor the complete 2006 and 2009 g \u2032 -band datasets obtained\nwith WHT/ULTRACAM. In the 2006 data we detect a signal at a frequency of \u223c1700cycles/day (P\u223c50s), although it\nis incoherent and spread over a wide frequency range. We\nestimate the quality factor (the peak centroid frequency divided by its full width at half maximum) of this signal to be\nQ \u223c4 in the g \u2032 -band data.

In\nall four panels, vertical lines mark the positions of the superhump and orbital frequencies.\nIf the top panel of Figure 5 is examined, it can be\nseen that the power due to superhumps is clearly apparent,\nstronger than the orbital signal and peaking at a slightly\nlower frequency. The two signals are confused in this first\npanel, but the superhump is seen as being clearly distinct\nin the second panel, in which the majority of the orbital\nmodulation is masked.\nIn order to determine the parameters of the 2006 superhump, we fitted a model to the combined dataset with the\neclipse features masked. The model consists of a combination\nof six 4-parameter sine functions: three for the superhump,\nfitting the primary frequency and the second and third harmonics, and three for harmonics of the orbital period, so as\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSDSS J0926+3624: The shortest period eclipsing binary star\n2006, unmodified\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n2006, with eclipse\nmasked\n\n1.0\n\nPower\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n2006, with superhump\nsubtracted\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n2009, unmodified\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n46\n\n48\n\n50\n52\nCycles/day\n\n54\n\nFigure 5.

In the third panel of Figure 5 the periodogram for\nthe unmasked dataset with the superhump components subtracted is plotted. We see that our model fits do a good job\nof cleaning the superhump signal from the data.\nOur findings for the superhump period are listed in\nTable 2. The uncertainties on these periods were determined from fits to a series of sample datasets derived\nfrom the originals using the bootstrap method (Efron 1979;\nEfron & Tibshirani 1993). The amplitudes of the superhump\nharmonics are < 10% of the amplitude values for the primary frequency. We find the period of the variation to be\nconsistent at the 1\u03c3 level for the u\u2032 - and g \u2032 -bands, but the\nr \u2032 -band period is lower. This inconsistency is probably due\nto some extra intrinsic variability, such as accretion-driven\nflickering. The amplitude of the modulation increases at\nlonger wavelengths. We list also in this table the period\nexcesses \u01eb in each band, using the orbital period given in\nSection 4.1.\nFinally, the fourth panel of Figure 5 shows the 2009\ndata. This plot shows a clean signal at the orbital frequency,\nconfirming that there is no superhump modulation in these\ndata. Following these observations, we obtained a series of\n1h light curves using LT/RISE over the first half of 2009.\nThe purpose of these observations was to examine the long\nterm behaviour of the superhump, although with hindsight\nthey were perhaps too short. Two of these light curves were\nin the immediate aftermath of an outburst in this system,\nand we will discuss these separately in Section 3.3.1. Of the\nremaining light curves, few show clear evidence for the superhump. On 17 February and 21 March there is a 'hump'\njust before the eclipse, but this could be due to the bright\nspot. Most of the remaining quiescent light curves show little out-of-eclipse variation. One exception is the light curve\nobtained on 19 April, which shows a clear brightening immediately following the eclipse, which can only be explained by\nthe superhump. This light curve was obtained 21 days after\nthe detection of the outburst in this system. There was no\nclear evidence for the superhump obtained seven days prior\nto this one, on 12 April.\nPatterson et al. (2005) suggested \u01eb = 0.18q + 0.29q 2 as\nan empirical relationship between the superhump period excess \u01eb = (PSH \u2212 POrb )/POrb , and the mass ratio q. This\nrelationship was calibrated using measurements of a series\nof eclipsing systems, listed in Table 7 of Patterson et al.\n(2005). The relation is pinned by setting \u01eb = 0 when q = 0,\nbut this is an assumption and not empirically determined:\nof the calibration systems only KV UMa has a mass ratio < 0.05 and this determination is very uncertain, and\nso the calibration is potentially poor at low mass ratios.\nSDSS 0926 is therefore potentially a strong test of this relationship, although it has been argued that it would not\napply to AM CVn systems (Pearson 2007). In Figure 6 we\nreproduce Figure 1 from Patterson et al. (2005), adding our\nmeasurements from the 2006 data in u\u2032 , g \u2032 and r \u2032 , using\nthe values given in Tables 2 and 6. As well as the Patterson relation, we also plot the slightly modified relation\nproposed by Kato et al. (2009) (\u01eb = 0.16(2)q + 0.25(7)q 2 )\nand the linear relation proposed by Knigge (2006) (q(\u01eb) =\n(0.114\u00b10.005)+(3.97\u00b10.41)\u00d7(\u01eb\u22120.025)).

(2005) relation, which suggests the\nassumption of \u01eb = 0 when q = 0 is reasonable.\n3.3\n\nOutbursting behaviour\n\nThe superhumps are a transient phenomenon that is driven\nby outbursts, so here we examine the outbursting history of\nthis system, presenting the first observations of SDSS 0926\nin outburst. We begin by discussing observations taken with\nthe LT in the immediate aftermath of an outburst in March\n2009. We go on to examine the long-term outbursting behaviour using five years of CRTS observations.\n3.3.1\n\nThe March 2009 outburst\n\nOn 29 March 2009 it was discovered that SDSS 0926 was\nin outburst. We obtained 2h of data with LT/RISE on the\nsubsequent night, and a further 1h on the night after that.\nWe plot these data in Figure 7. The flux scale for these data\nis such that the mean, quiescent out-of eclipse flux is equal\nto 1. We also plot the model fit (described in Section 4.2,\nbelow) to our quiescent superhump subtracted LT/RISE observations for comparison. We apply an arbitrary flux offset\nto this model light curve so as to overlay it on the outburst\ndata. We see that at the beginning of our 30 March observation the system was a factor of \u223c3.5 brighter than during\nquiescence and declining quickly: this has dropped to a factor of 3 by the end of the 2h observation. The following night\nthis has dropped to a factor of 2. There is still some evidence\nof the outburst in our next observation on 12 April: the outof-eclipse flux in this light curve is \u223c10% greater than the\nmean level.\nWe phase-folded the 30 March data using the ephemeris\ngiven in Section 4.1, and plot the results in Figure 8. Again,\n\nwe plot a quiescent model light curve for comparison. In\nthis plot the structure in the light curve after the outburst\nis more evident. There are two main features: the primary\neclipse centred on a phase of 0, and a separate, smaller dimming in the light curve centred on a phase of \u223c\u22120.25. If we\nexamine the primary eclipse first we see it is much deeper\nand wider than the quiescent white dwarf eclipse. The eclipse\nwidth is consistent with this being an eclipse of the accretion disc. The eclipse is asymmetric however, and there is a\nclear 'step' in the egress. This suggests an uneven distribution of flux over the surface of the accretion disc itself, or\n(perhaps more likely) this step could be due to the bright\nspot. The step height of this egress is much larger than the\nbright spot egress during quiescence however, and so if this\nfeature is attributed to the spot it would imply an enhanced\nmass transfer during the outbursting state, or an increased\nviscous heating at the bright spot position.\nThe second unusual feature in the phase-folded light\ncurve is the dimming centred on a phase of \u223c\u22120.25. This\ndimming begins at approximately the same time that the\nbright spot begins to come into view in the quiescent light\ncurve. The phase of this feature is such that the eclipsing\ncomponent cannot be either the white dwarf, the donor or\nthe bright spot. We suggest this feature may be due to a\nwarped accretion disc (Pringle 1996), the distortion being\ninduced by the outburst. The dimming we see can therefore\nbe explained by obscuration of the white dwarf or inner disc\nby the accretion disc itself. This is a very short lived feature: we see no evidence for it in the data collected on the\nsubsequent night.\nFinally, as we discussed in Section 3.2.2 we detect superhumps in this system in data obtained 21 days after the\noutburst. This is consistent with the expectation that, since\nthe superhumps in this system are not permanently present,\nthey are induced by the perturbation of the disc by the outburst.\n3.3.2\n\nLong-term variations\n\nWe plot in Figure 9 the unfiltered data collected by the\nCatalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS). These data\nwere collected between 10 November 2004 and 11 June 2010.\nWe observe a total of either six or seven outbursts in these\ndata, but the time sampling is such that they do not give an\nexhaustive picture of the outbursting behaviour of the source\nover this time period: there are no observations around the\ntime of the March 2009 outburst, for example, and so this\noutburst is missed. Note that we do detect an outburst \u223c25\ndays before the 2006 ULTRACAM observations. It is likely\nthat this outburst induced the superhumps we see in these\ndata by perturbing the disc.\nThe CRTS data is split up into blocks of four 30s observations taken over a \u223c30 min period. There is typically\n> 20 days between these blocks, and so in most cases the\nsource has returned to quiescence by the time of the observation block subsequent to the detection of the outburst. The\nexception is the sixth and seventh outburst: these are separated by only eight days with no intermediate points, so may\nbe one long outburst or two separate ones. An 8+ day outburst is long considering the orbital period of this system:\nif we scale by orbital period this would be the equivalent of\na 2 month long outburst in a P = 3.5 h dwarf nova.

The outbursts range in magnitude\nfrom 17.11 \u00b1 0.08 to 16.81 \u00b1 0.12. Note that for all six outbursts it is unclear how much time has elapsed between the\ninitial rise and the observation, and so these measurements\nset a lower limit on the peak brightness. Our LT/RISE observations of the March 2009 outburst showed a factor \u223c3\nenhancement in flux a day after the initial detection, and a\nfactor \u223c2 enhancement a day after that. This is relatively\nmodest compared to the outbursts observed in the CRTS\ndata. We conclude that the March 2009 outburst was a relatively minor one for this source. An outburst of this size\nwould only be detectable in the CRTS data within 1 \u2013 2 days\nof the initial rise. The average outburst recurrence time is\ntherefore difficult to determine.

The X-ray spectral fit parameters derived using a simultaneous fit to the EPIC pn and MOS spectra.\n\n3.4.1\n\nX-ray data\n\nWe extracted light curves from the EPIC pn and both EPIC\nMOS cameras and combined them into one light curve,\nwhich was folded using the ephemeris given in Section 4.1.\nWe found no evidence for an eclipse in the X-ray light curve.\nTo investigate this further we searched for periods using a\nDiscrete Fourier Transform and phase dispersion methods\nand found no clear signal of an eclipse.\nUsing the original X-ray light curve as a benchmark, we\nadded an eclipse of given depth to the light curve. We generated 100 light curves for a given eclipse depth. We found\nthat for a partial eclipse with a depth of < 90%, we would\nlikely not detect the eclipse. Even for a total eclipse we would\nhave only a 70% probability of detecting the eclipse.\nWe extracted integrated X-ray spectra from the EPIC\npn and MOS detectors (with corresponding background\nspectra) and fitted them simultaneously using an absorbed\nthermal plasma model. Unlike other AM CVn systems\n(Ramsay et al. 2005, 2006), we found that varying the metal\nabundance did not significantly improve the goodness of fit\n(probably since the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra was\nrelatively low). We obtained a good fit to the data, and the\nderived spectral parameters are listed in Table 3.\nThe best-fit value for the absorption is high (1.3\u00b10.3 \u00d7\n1021 cm\u22122 ) for an object at a high galactic latitude (+46\u25e6 ).\nIn contrast, the absorption to the edge of the Galaxy is\n\u223c 1.4 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Dickey & Lockman 1990). If we fix\nthe column density parameter in the spectral fits to the\nDickey & Lockman (1990) value the resulting fit (\u03c72\u03bd =1.96,\n104 dof) was poorer at a confidence level of > 99.99%. If\nthis 'extra' absorption originates in SDSS 0926 itself it may\nbe due to viewing the boundary layer through the disc, since\nthe binary inclination is high. Finally, we calculate the unabsorbed bolometric X-ray luminosity using the distance given\nin Section 5.2, and find it to be Lx = 6.9 \u00d7 1030 erg s\u22121 .\n\n3.4.2\n\nFigure 10. Phase folded UV lightcurves obtained using XMMNewton OM. The top and bottom plots are through the UVW1\nand UVM2 filters, respectively.\n\nUltraviolet data\n\nWe binned the OM light curves into 5s bins and folded them\non the ephemeris given in Section 4.1. The resulting light\ncurve is plotted in Figure 10. The eclipse is clearly seen in\nthe UVW1 filter, where the count rate is consistent with\nzero at \u03c6=0.0 in a single bin. In the shorter wavelength filter, UVM2, the signal-to-noise ratio is lower, but there is\nsome evidence for a dip at \u03c6=0.0, although it is not total. We searched for other periods using a Discrete Fourier\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSDSS J0926+3624: The shortest period eclipsing binary star\n\n11\n\nin Section 3.4.1, the galactic E(B \u2212 V ) is negligible, but\nwe measure some extra absorption in the X-ray data. This\nis probably related to the high inclination of this system\nand due to our looking through a significant amount of gas\nabove the accretion disc. Similar effects are seen in a number\nof CVs, such as V893 Sco (Mukai et al. 2009). This material will not be in the form of dust and so will not cause\n'extinction' in the classical sense, but it is possible that it\nmay cause an 'accretion curtain' in this system, such as in\nOY Car (Horne et al. 1994). If this was the case then our\ntemperature determination was a lower limit. However, it is\nimpossible to detect such an effect without UV spectroscopic\ndata. Our temperature determination for the white dwarf\nis consistent (within the uncertainties) with the theoretical\nmodels of Bildsten et al. (2006), which predict a temperature of 18, 000K for this system.\nFigure 11. We determine the white dwarf temperature by fitting our measurements of the white dwarf flux in the optical and\nUV to a library of synthetic spectra (G\u00e4nsicke et al. 1995). The\nspectrum we plot here is for a 17, 000K white dwarf, and is the\nbest fit to our flux determinations. The numbers in the top right\ncorner are the temperature and log g for the model fit.\n\nTransform (Deeming 1975) and phase dispersion methods\n(Stellingwerf 1978) and found no other significant periods\nin the light curves.\nWe derived UV fluxes by converting the count rate in\nthe two UV filters to a flux by assuming a conversion factor which was derived using observations of white dwarfs\nusing XMM-Newton OM. A mean count rate of 0.71 \u00b1 0.02\nct/s in the UVW1 filter corresponds to a flux of 3.2\u00d710\u221216\nerg s\u22121 cm\u22122 /\u00c5, while 0.27 \u00b1 0.01 ct/s in the UVM2 filter\ncorresponds to a flux of 5.3\u00d710\u221216 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 /\u00c5. We calculate the ultraviolet luminosity following the approach of\nRamsay et al. (2005, 2006), by assuming a blackbody flux\ndistribution and fixing the normalisation to give the inferred\nde-reddened ultraviolet flux in the two filters. This gives an\nultraviolet luminosity of Luv = 1 \u2013 3 \u00d7 1032 erg s\u22121 . Both\nthis luminosity and the X-ray luminosity Lx , given in the\nprevious section, are consistent with the findings for other\nAM CVn systems of similar period (Ramsay et al. 2006).\nWe used the UV and optical fluxes to determine the\neffective temperature of the white dwarf, by estimating the\ncontribution of the white dwarf in each band. In the three\nULTRACAM bands this parameter is determined through\nour model fits, as discussed in Section 4. In the UV data\nwe estimated the white dwarf contribution from the eclipse\ndepth. We made a correction to compensate for the fact\nthat the eclipse is only partial, by determining the fraction of the white dwarf's surface area that is obscured during the eclipse in our optical fits. This correction is small\nthough, as evidenced by the fact that the UVW1 flux reaches\nzero during the eclipse, within the errors. We calculated the\nwhite dwarf contributions to be UVM2 \u223c0.04 \u00b1 0.02, UVW1\n\u223c0.062 \u00b1 0.012, u\u2032 = 0.057 \u00b1 0.005, g \u2032 = 0.046 \u00b1 0.002\nand r \u2032 = 0.035 \u00b1 0.002 mJy. We then fitted these fluxes\nwith the white dwarf model atmospheres introduced in\nG\u00e4nsicke et al. (1995). We find a white dwarf temperature\nof 17, 000K to be consistent with our measurements (Figure 11). Note that in making this estimate we have not applied an extinction correction to these fluxes. As we noted\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n4\n\nLIGHT CURVE ANALYSIS\n\nIn this section we describe the model we fitted to the phasefolded and binned WHT/ULTRACAM 2006 and 2009 data\nin order to make parameter determinations for this system.\nFor the 2006 data it was first necessary to subtract the nightto-night variations caused by the superhump; this is detailed\nin Section 3.2.2. Secondly, we fitted the data on an eclipseby-eclipse basis in order to refine the ephemeris, which we\ndiscuss in Section 4.1. We then phase-folded the data using\nthis ephemeris and fitted it with a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) light-curve model in order to obtain final\nparameter determinations. We fit the three bands separately.\nThis fitting process is described in Section 4.2.\n\n4.1\n\nDetermination of the ephemeris\n\nWe divided each light curve into separate orbital cycles, and\nthen fit the model determined in Section 4.2 to each cycle\nusing the Levendburg-Marquardt method (Press 2002) in\norder to generate a series of eclipse timings. These timings\nare on the barycentric dynamical timescale, corrected for\nlight travel to the solar system barycentre. A least-squares\nfit to all of these data yields the ephemeris\nM JD(T DB) = 53795.9455191(5) + 0.01966127289(2)E\nfor the mid-point of the white dwarf eclipse. We plot the\nresiduals of the linear ephemeris in Figure 12. There is some\nsystematic variation, perhaps due to the residuals of the superhump or flickering. With only two epochs of observation\nany long-term departure from a linear ephemeris cannot be\ndetermined: a third epoch of high-speed observation will be\nnecessary to identify any period changes in this system.\n\n4.2\n\nFitting the phase-folded light curves\n\nIn order to make precise parameter determinations we chose\nto combine our data into phase-folded and binned light\ncurves. We began by preparing the 2006 data for fitting by\nsubtracting the superhump modulation from the data, using the parameters determined in Section 3.2.2.

(O \u2212 C) values plotted against cycle number, using the eclipse timings determined from the model fits to our\nWHT/ULTRACAM data and the linear ephemeris given in Section 4.1. Cycle 0 corresponds to the first eclipse in the 1 March 2006\ndataset. Note the break in the x-axis of this plot between the various nights of data.\n\nthis second epoch of data. Once the superhump was subtracted it became clear that other binary parameters varied over the course of our observations, in particular the\ndisc radius which changes significantly from night to night.\nThese variations prevented us from combining our entire\nWHT/ULTRACAM dataset. We therefore chose to create\nseparate phase-folded light curves for each individual night\nof observation. Even this could potentially introduce some\nsystematic effect on our results due to the change in disc\nradius between the beginning and end of each night's observation. We examine this in detail in Section 5.4 and find that\nsuch effects are small, so we do not believe this influences\nour results to a significant degree. Since we cannot combine nights, we chose to omit the nights of 5 March 2006,\n1 January 2009 and 3 January 2009, in which we only have\na few cycles of data. We therefore fitted a total of twelve\nlight curves: the u\u2032 -, g \u2032 - and r \u2032 -band phase-folded data for\nthe nights of 1, 2 and 3 of March 2006; and 2 January 2009.\n\nof the emission we do not require this degree of complexity.\nWe therefore use a simpler bright spot model, setting the\nexponent \u03b3 to 1 (our bright spot model is therefore identical\nto the earlier prescription of Horne et al. 1994). Secondly,\nin Copperwheat et al. (2010) the angle \u03c6 was defined as the\nangle the line of elements of the bright spot makes with the\nline of centres between the two stars. We have changed the\ndefinition of this angle in our code: \u03c6 is now the angle the\nline of elements of the bright spot makes with the tangent\nto the outer edge of the accretion disc. This modification\nmakes this angle easier to interpret in a physical context,\nsince \u03c6 = 0 implies a bright spot which runs along the outer\nedge of the disc, and so we would expect \u03c6 to be close to\nthis. We noted in Copperwheat et al. (2010) that the two\nangles \u03c6 and \u03c8 (the angle away from the perpendicular at\nwhich the light from the bright spot is beamed) are highly\ncorrelated and tend to be poorly constrained, and so here\nwe fix \u03c6 = 0.\n\nWe modelled the light curve with LCURVE, a code developed to fit light-curves characteristic of eclipsing dwarf\nnovae and detached white dwarf / M dwarf binary stars. A\ncomplete description of this code is given in the appendix\nof Copperwheat et al. (2010). We implemented this code in\nthis work with two modifications, both to the bright spot\ncomponent. In Copperwheat et al. (2010) the bright spot is\nmodelled as a line of elements which lie upon a straight line\nin the orbital plane. The surface brightness of the elements\nis parameterised with two power-law exponents. Since the\nbright spot in SDSS 0926 is a relatively weak component\n\nIn the LCURVE code the binary is defined by four components: a white dwarf primary, a Roche-lobe filling secondary star, accretion disc and bright-spot. We first obtained an initial fit to each light curve using the simplex and\nLevenberg-Marquardt methods (Press 2002). We then used\na Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for minimisation and determination of uncertainties (details of our\nMCMC method are also given in Copperwheat et al. 2010).\nWe fitted all of the parameters used in Copperwheat et al.\n(2010), with the exception of \u03b3 and \u03c6, as described above.\nWe additionally set the accretion disc radius Rdisc equal\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSDSS J0926+3624: The shortest period eclipsing binary star\nTable 4.

We therefore assume that the 'head' of\nthe bright spot is on the outer rim of the disc. Rdisc is\nrather poorly constrained by our data, and as we showed\nin Copperwheat et al. (2010) Rspot is highly correlated with\nRdisc , so this is a reasonable approximation. One additional\nparameter which our results are potentially sensitive to is\nthe limb darkening of the primary white dwarf. We made\nan initial fit to the data in order to estimate the effective\ntemperature and surface gravity (we discuss these quantities in Section 5.2), and then used a model atmosphere code\n(described in Koester 2010) to calculate the specific intensity at different points across the stellar disc. We then fitted\nthese values to determine the limb darkening coefficients.\nWe tried various limb darkening laws, and found the best fit\nwas for the four-parameter law of Claret (2000), although\nthe choice between this and a fourth order polynomial is\nunlikely to influence our results. We list our determinations\nof the coefficients in Table 4. These values were used in all\nour MCMC fits.\nThe parameter determinations from these fits are listed\nin Table 5. Note that the uncertainties on these MCMC results are non-Gaussian, and so the values we quote in this\ntable only provide an approximate description of the uncertainties. We plot the distribution of the mass ratio and\ninclination values from our fits in Figure 14. Additionally,\nin Figure 13 the phase-folded light curves for the four nights\nare plotted, along with the best model fits. If we examine\nFigure 13 first, we see we obtain a good fit to the data in\nall three bands for each of the four nights. The dominant\ncomponent in the light curve is the primary white dwarf,\nand the main eclipse in the light curve is the eclipse of this\nfeature. Note that the eclipse is round-bottomed, meaning\nit is a partial eclipse of the white dwarf. The second, smaller\neclipse in these light curves is of the bright spot, which is\na much weaker component. The phase of this eclipse clearly\nvaries with respect to the phase of the white dwarf eclipse:\nthis can be understood in terms of a change in the relative\nposition of the bright spot due to variations in the disc radius. Compare for example the first night of 2006 with the\nsecond. On the first night, the two eclipses are clearly distinct, with the egress of the white dwarf followed by the\ningress of the bright spot. On the second night, the egress\nand the ingress overlap. This implies a larger apparent accretion disc radius on the second night, due to the precession\nof the elliptical disc. The two other nights of data lie somewhere between these two extremes. The fact that the two\neclipses are sometimes separate implies a very low mass ratio for this system: in higher mass ratio systems we would\nexpect to see the ingress of both the white dwarf and the\nbright spot before the white dwarf egress.\nWe now turn to the parameter determinations listed in\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n13\n\nTable 5. The first four of these are the parameters that are\nimportant in characterising the system: these are the mass\nratio q, the binary inclination i, the primary white dwarf\nradius scaled by the binary separation R1 /a, and the accretion disc radius scaled by the binary separation Rdisc /a.\nThe mass ratio and the inclination are highly correlated,\nand we discuss these parameters in Section 5.1. The white\ndwarf temperature is used with q, i and R1 /a to derive the\nremaining binary parameters in Section 5.2. We discuss the\ndisc radius in more detail in Section 5.4. The remaining six\nparameters in Table 5 pertain to the accretion disc and the\nbright spot. We find these parameters to be rather poorly\nconstrained in general, due to the fact that the disc and the\nbright spot make a relatively weak contribution to the flux in\nthis system. However, we find no correlation between these\nparameters and the 'important' parameters listed above, and\nso the uncertainty in these values does not imply any further\nsystematic uncertainty in the determinations of Sections 5.1\nand 5.4.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nMass ratio and inclination\n\nIf we assume a Roche-lobe filling donor star, the phase width\nof the white dwarf eclipse is then an observable quantity\nthat is intrinsically linked to two physical properties: the\nmass ratio and the binary inclination. For a higher binary\ninclination the duration of the eclipse will be greater, thus\nto maintain the same phase width, as the inclination is increased, the size of the donor, and hence the mass ratio,\nmust be decreased. There is therefore a unique relationship\nbetween these two properties (Bailey 1979). This degeneracy can be broken since we have an additional geometric\nconstraint due to the ingress and egress of the bright spot.\nThe path of the accretion stream and hence the position of\nthe bright spot is modified by the mass ratio. With this additional information we can determine both the mass ratio\nand inclination in this system.\nOur MCMC results for the mass ratio versus inclination\nare plotted in Figure 14. We see that these points are distributed along a curved path across this plot: this is the line\nof constant phase width for the white dwarf, which we measure to be \u223c0.0220. The points are constrained to this line,\nwith the scatter due to the uncertainty in the phase width.\nWe calculate the weighted means of the q, i and R1 /a values\nin Table 5, and present the results in Table 6. We emphasise\nat this point that the weighted means may underestimate\nthe uncertainties in these parameters. The MCMC results\nin Table 5 show variations which are formally significant,\nmost likely due to effects such as flickering and residuals\nfrom the superhumps. In addition, the bright spot component is weak in this system, and so the best fit model for this\ncomponent can be quite different in different bands, particularly in u\u2032 . It is important therefore to note that the results\nwe discuss in this and the following sections, and in Table 6,\nmay not fully account for these systematic effects, and the\nmagnitude of these effects are better understood by referring\nto the individual night's results in Table 5.\nWe find the mass ratio M2 /M1 to be q = 0.041\u00b10.002 in\nour g \u2032 -band measurements. The inclination is i = 82.6 \u00b1 0.3\n\n\f14\n\nC.M.

Phase-folded and binned light curves for the first, second and third nights of the 2006 observations, and the second night\nof the 2009 observations. For each we plot the three bands separately (top, u\u2032 ; middle, g \u2032 ; bottom, r \u2032 ). We plot the average flux in mJy\nagainst the binary phase, where a phase of 0 corresponds to the mid-eclipse of the white dwarf. We plot the datapoints with uncertainties\nin black, and the best model fits to these data in blue, green and red (for u\u2032 , g \u2032 and r \u2032 , respectively). For clarity we apply offsets of\n0.005mJy to the g-band data and 0.01mJy to the u-band. For each night we also show underneath the lightcurve the three components\nof the g \u2032 -band model plotted separately, showing the relative strengths of the bright spot, accretion disc and white dwarf. These three\nlines have also been offset for clarity.\n\ndeg in g \u2032 . The values of q and i in the other two bands are\nconsistent with these values. Our 2006 data were originally\npublished in Marsh et al. (2007) and there we reported different values of 0.035 \u00b1 0.002 and 83.1 \u00b1 0.1 deg for q and\ni. This discrepancy is due to a number of factors. Primarily, the MCMC method we use for minimisation is superior to the Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation employed in\nMarsh et al. (2007). We have found in situations of strong\ndegeneracy, such as between q and i here, the LevenbergMarquardt and simplex methods have a tendency to stop\nbefore finding the true minimum (Copperwheat et al. 2010).\nAdditionally, we have used more appropriate limb-darkening\ncoefficients in this work, since we have been able to estimate\nthe white dwarf temperature. Marsh et al. (2007) also arrived at their parameter determinations by combining data\nfrom different nights, which as we have discussed may intro-\n\nduce some systematic uncertainty due to the changing disc\nradius.\n\n5.2\n\nOther binary parameters\n\nIn Table 6 we list our determination of the primary white\ndwarf radius, scaled by the binary separation. We used this,\ncombined with our determination of the mass ratio and the\nbinary inclination, to calculate the remaining binary parameters. One additional piece of information that was needed\nfor this is a mass/radius relation for the primary white\ndwarf.\nWe determined this by using the white dwarf temperature, which we found in Section 3.4.2 to be 17, 000K. However this is an iterative process, since the temperature determination itself requires a mass/radius relation. The process was as follows. We began by assuming a mass/radius\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSDSS J0926+3624: The shortest period eclipsing binary star\n\n15\n\nFigure 14. The distribution of the mass ratio q and inclination i results from our MCMC runs, with the green and red regions indicating\nthe 1\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 confidence intervals. We plot (from left to right) nights 1, 2 and 3 of the 2006 observations, and night 2 of the 2009\nobservations. For each night we plot (top to bottom) the distribution in the u\u2032 , g \u2032 and r \u2032 bands.\n\nrelation for the white dwarf, and for this we used the\nEggleton zero-temperature mass/radius relation (quoted in\nVerbunt & Rappaport 1988). We subsequently determined\nthe mass and radius of the white dwarf, and from our\nmodel calculated the white dwarf contribution in each band.\nIt is these white dwarf fluxes which we list in Section\n3.4.2. We then used the white dwarf model atmospheres of\nG\u00e4nsicke et al. (1995) to calculate the white dwarf temperature Tef f , fixing log g to the value implied by the zerotemperature mass and radius. We then compared these values of Tef f and M1 to the white dwarf cooling models of\nBergeron et al. (1995) in order to find the white dwarf radius which is consistent with these values. By comparing this\nto the Eggleton zero-temperature radius, we determined an\n'oversize factor' for the white dwarf, which we found to be\n1.03. Finally, we determine a final white dwarf mass and\nradius using a new mass/radius relation, which is the zerotemperature relation scaled by this oversize factor. In theory,\nat this point we should then re-iterate this process and use\nthe new mass and radius to refine the temperature determination. However, since the first oversize factor is very close to\n1 the effect of further iterations is negligible: the white dwarf\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\ntemperature fit is not affected by the very small change in\nlog g which results from a 3% increase in the white dwarf\nradius. Note also that since the oversize factor is so close\nto 1, while the uncertainty in our temperature measurement\nmay be quite large (since it is based on a small number of\nflux measurements) it will not affect our parameter determinations to a significant degree.\nIn the second half of Table 6, we list the binary separation a, the masses of the two components, the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two components and the radius of\nthe secondary. This radius is the volume radius of the Roche\nlobe filling donor, which we calculate using the approximation of Eggleton (1983). In our g \u2032 -band fits, we find the mass\nof the primary white dwarf to be 0.85 \u00b1 0.04M\u2299 . The mass\nof the donor is 0.035 \u00b1 0.003M\u2299 and the donor radius is\n0.047 \u00b1 0.001R\u2299 . In Marsh et al. (2007), we reported the\nprimary mass to be 0.84 \u00b1 0.05M\u2299 and the donor mass to\nbe 0.029 \u00b1 0.002M\u2299 . These values are close to our updated\nfindings \u2013 the differences are primarily due to the reasons\ndiscussed in Section 5.1, as well as our accounting for the\nfinite temperature of the primary white dwarf in this work.\nFinally, by using our measurements of the white dwarf\n\n\f16\n\nC.M.

(2007) measured the masses of five systems using parallax measurements obtained with HST, and found\nfour of the five to be consistent with a partially degenerate\ndonor. The degree of degeneracy varied, but the donor was\ntypically found to have a mass of between 2 and 4 times the\nmass of a fully degenerate donor. The lowest estimate was\nfor HP Lib, which was found to have a donor mass of 1.6 \u2013\n2.9 times the fully degenerate mass. At 1.75 times the fully\ndegenerate mass, SDSS 0926 is by comparison at the lower\nend of these estimates.\nWe now examine the finding of a donor mass of 0.035 \u00b1\n0.003M\u2299 in the context of the evolutionary history of this\nsystem. There are three proposed formation paths for AM\nCVn binaries and all three are consistent with a donor\nthat is partially degenerate to some degree. The 'white\ndwarf channel' (Nelemans et al. 2001) suggests detached\nclose double white dwarfs which are brought into contact\nas a result of angular momentum loss due to gravitational\nwave radiation (GWR). Nelemans et al. (2001) used a zerotemperature donor in their formulation, but Deloye et al.\n(2005) argued that the donors could be semi-degenerate\nto some degree, depending on the contact time of the binary. The second formation path is the 'helium star channel' (Iben & Tutukov 1991). In this scenario the donor is\na low-mass, non-degenerate helium burning star. Following contact, material is accreted from the helium star onto\nthe primary white dwarf until a donor mass of \u223c 0.2M\u2299 is\nreached, at which point core helium burning ceases and the\nstar becomes semi-degenerate. Further mass transfer driven\nby GWR sees the donor mass decrease and the orbital period increase to values consistent with the observed AM CVn\npopulation. The third scenario is the 'evolved CV channel'\n(Podsiadlowski et al. 2003) which suggests the progenitors\nof AM CVns are CVs with evolved secondaries. The donor\nin this channel is initially non-degenerate and hydrogen-rich,\nbut becomes degenerate and helium-rich (but still with a few\nper cent hydrogen) during its evolution before Roche lobe\noverflow.\nNelemans et al. (2001) approximated the mass-radius\nrelationship for a helium star donor and thus modelled the\nevolution of AM CVns formed via the helium star channel.\nBased on the examples provided, an AM CVn with a period equal to that of SDSS 0926 should have a donor mass\nof \u223c0.05M\u2299 if it were formed by this channel. Table 1 of\nPodsiadlowski et al. (2003) lists model parameter determinations for six AM CVns assuming they were formed via the\nevolved CV channel. For the two systems in this table closest in period to SDSS 0926 (V803 Cen and CP Eri), these\nresults predict the donor mass to be \u223c0.04M\u2299 at the point\nat which the orbital period of the system begins to increase.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSDSS J0926+3624: The shortest period eclipsing binary star\n\n17\n\nTable 6.

Variation in the accretion disc radius over the course\nof our 2006 observations.

The three panels of the plot show the results for the first,\nsecond and third night.\n\nSince the donor mass in Marsh et al. (2007) was found\nto be 0.029 \u00b1 0.002M\u2299 , lower than the theoretical values\nproposed for the helium star and evolved CV channels,\nDeloye et al. (2007) argued that this was evidence for formation via the white dwarf channel. The updated donor\nmass value we report here of 0.035 \u00b1 0.003M\u2299 is consistent\nwith formation via the evolved CV channel, and is within\na few \u03c3 of the Nelemans et al. (2001) value for the helium\nstar channel. We conclude therefore that our current findings do not strongly preclude any of the three formation\nchannels. More precise determinations are likely to be possible if we are able to make more observations of SDSS 0926\nin its non-superhumping state, since even after subtracting\nthe superhump from our data there is likely to still be some\nresidual systematic effect. The discovery of new eclipsing\nAM CVn systems is also key, particularly at the short end\nof the period distribution where there is the biggest discrepancy between the various donor mass predictions.\n\n5.4\n\nThe disc radius\n\nIn Table 5 we list the apparent accretion disc radius for each\nnight as determined from our MCMC fits. This is determined\nfrom the position of the bright spot, since we assume the\nbright spot to be at the outer edge of the accretion disc. We\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nsee in this table that the disc radius changes by between 10\nand 20% from night to night. As we discussed in Section 4.2\nthis is also apparent in the lightcurves (Figure 13) with the\nphase of the bright spot eclipse changing between nights.\nThe changes we observe here are not due to radial variations in a circular disc, rather the disc is non-circular and\nthe measured positions of the bright spot sample the possible\nrange in disc radii. The superhumps we observe are generally taken to imply an elliptical and precessing disc, but the\ndisc shape may be more complex than this, with detailed\nnumerical simulations suggesting an irregular disc shape in\nsuperhumping AM CVn systems (Simpson & Wood 1998).\nThe changing bright spot location we find in this system\nis in strong contrast with the study of AM CVn itself by\nRoelofs et al. (2006), who found very little variation in the\nbright spot position. This difference may be related to the\nvery different \u1e40 s which would be expected in these two systems. However, AM CVn was also found to be inconsistent\nwith the Patterson \u01eb \u2013 q relation (Section 3.2.2), which is\npresumed to be independent of \u1e40 .\nWe investigated our bright spot findings further by dividing our data into sections, in order to see if the disc radius\nvariations can be observed over the course of a single night.\nWe split each night of the 2006 data into sections that are\n5/6 orbital cycles in length, and phase-folded and fitted each\nsection individually (Figure 15). We find there is a noticeable increase in radius when we compare the two halves of\nthe first night, with R1 /a increasing from 0.318 \u00b1 0.007 to\n0.356 \u00b1 0.006. During the second night the disc radius appears to be approximately constant over the course of our\n8h observation, and over the course of the third night a\nslight decrease in radius is observed when the two halves of\nthe night are compared. These variations appear consistent\nwith the precession period of the superhump.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have presented high time resolution observations of the eclipsing P = 28 min AM CVn binary\nSDSS 0926 obtained with the fast CCD camera ULTRACAM mounted on the William Herschel Telescope. The\nprimary aim of these observations was precise parameter\ndeterminations for the two binary components, using the\nphotometric method. We determine the mass ratio to be\n\n\f18\n\nC.M. Copperwheat et al.\n\nq = M2 /M1 = 0.041 \u00b1 0.002, and the inclination to be\n82.6 \u00b1 0.3 deg. We calculate the mass of the primary white\ndwarf to be 0.85\u00b10.04M\u2299 , and find the donor to be partially\ndegenerate with a mass of 0.035 \u00b1 0.003M\u2299 . We also measure the eclipse timings with precision, and should be able\nto detect the period change due to gravitational wave losses\nwith a third epoch of high time resolution observations.\nWe observed in our 2006 WHT/ULTRACAM data the\nsuperhump that has previously been reported in this source.\nWe determine the period of this variation and find it to be in\nagreement with the period excess / mass ratio relationship\nproposed by Patterson et al. (2005). This phenomenon is not\npresent in the 2009 WHT/ULTRACAM data, but we do see\nevidence for it in some LT/RISE data collected over the\nfirst half of 2009. In addition to the superhump we observe\na quasi-periodic oscillation in the 2006 data, with a period\nof around 50s. Another interesting feature of our data is that\nwe observe the accretion disc radius to be highly variable.\nWe ascribe this to the tidal instability of the outer disc and\nobserve changes of up to 10% in the radius over successive\nnights.\nWe obtained X-ray and ultraviolet observations with\nXMM-Newton. We found no clear evidence for an eclipse\nin the X-ray light curve. The eclipse is detected in the ultraviolet with the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor, and by\nfitting our model to these data we inferred the ultraviolet\nfluxes of the primary white dwarf. We used these along with\nour ground-based determinations of the white dwarf optical\ncolours to determine the temperature of the white dwarf,\nwhich we found to be 17, 000K.\nUsing data collected with the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, we examined the outbursting behaviour of\nSDSS 0926 over a four and a half year period. We observed\nsix outbursts over this period, in which the source flux increases by \u223c2 \u2013 2.5 magnitudes. The average time between\noutbursts is \u223c100 - 200 days. We observed in detail one additional outburst with LT/RISE. These data show an increase\nin source flux of greater than a factor of 3, and a rapid decay.\nA lightcurve obtained one day after the detection of the outburst shows a complex structure, with the primary eclipse\nsuggesting an asymmetrical distribution of disc flux or possibly an enhanced bright spot emission. There is additionally\na dimming prior to the main eclipse which we suggest may\nbe due to a warp in the disc itself.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nCMC and TRM are supported under grant ST/F002599/1\nfrom the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).\nULTRACAM, VSD and SPL are supported by STFC grants\nPP/D002370/1 and PP/E001777/1.
