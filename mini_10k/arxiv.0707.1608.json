The complete spectrum of the endstates - naked singularities, or\nblackholes - of gravitational collapse is analyzed for a wide class of N -dimensional\nspacetimes in spherical symmetry, which includes and generalizes the dust solutions\nand the case of vanishing radial stresses. The final fate of the collapse is shown to be\nfully determined by the local behavior of a single scalar function and by the dimension\nN of the spacetime. In particular, the \"critical\" behavior of the N = 4 spacetimes,\nwhere a sort of phase transition from black hole to naked singularity can occur, is still\npresent if N = 5 but does not occur if N > 5, independently from the initial data of\nthe collapse.

Introduction\nUnderstanding singularities has always been one of the most intriguing issues in General\nRelativity since its beginning. The mathematical prediction that gravitational collapse\nmay lead to singularity formation hugely increased the attention over the study of last\nstage of heavy stars' life. Problems related to strong density regions of spacetimes\nare in need of an ultimate answer already and, over all, a satisfactory formulation of\nPenrose's Cosmic Censorship Conjecture [25]: the causal character, and the endstate,\nof singularities arising from a dynamical process such as an indefinite collapse, is still\none of the favorite test\u2013bed for relativity. A great amount of work in this direction has\nbeen done in the case of spherically symmetric 4\u2013dimensional spacetimes: a number\nof collapsing models have been analytically studied where, under suitable assumptions,\nthe arising singularity is not completely hidden behind a horizon, also when the latter\nforms. For instance the pioneering work of Christodoulou [2] showed that it suffices\nremoving homogeneity assumption from the paradigm of gravitational collapse leading\nto black hole \u2013 i.e. Oppenheimer\u2013Snyder solution. These cases of naked singularities\nhave been intensively explored, in particular Tolman\u2013Bondi\u2013Lemaitre dust clouds (see\n[14] and references therein), and vanishing radial stress models [19, 13].\nRecently, a class of new solutions have been found out [6], including the above\nas particular cases, where naked singularities generically appears as an outcome of\ncollapse. Physically, they describe the gravitational collapse of a class of anisotropic\nelastic materials, and are characterized by a particular choice of the equation of state\nthat, in a certain coordinate system, allows to reduce Einstein Field Equations to a\nquadrature. In this paper, we find a natural extension of this class of solutions to the\ncase of general N\u2013dimensional gravitation theory. The importance of higher dimensional\nmodels goes up e.g. to Kaluza-Klein theories, superstring theory, and brane\u2013world\nmodels \u2013 see in particular [12, 26], where a description of the world with more than four\nnon compact dimensions is proposed.\nIn this perspective, the present study is motivated by a number of earlier and more\nrecent works on spherically symmetric higher dimensional spacetimes: [1, 16] extend\nearlier well\u2013known results and properties of the four dimensional scalar field collapse;\nVaidya\u2013adS four dimensional solution is generalized in [18, 22] to higher dimensions\nadding extra gravity terms to the action functional. Far from being exhaustive, more\nreferences on the subject of higher dimensional collapse are [3, 8, 9, 11, 17]. In particular,\nthe class of solutions that we find extend again vanishing radial stress models as dust\n[4, 24]. We will find the complete spectrum of endstates, analyzing if and how it is\nmodified by the dimension of the spacetime N. In particular, naked singularities will be\nproved to survive in any larger dimension, despite earlier results contained in [10, 20] \u2013\nsee discussion at the end.\nIt is worth noticing that some criticism arose to singularities occurring in\nastrophysical sources modeled with continuous media in the past, due to the fact that\none can construct situations in which Newtonian systems made out of continua develop\n\n\fDimensional dependence of naked singularity formation\n\n3\n\nsingularities. As a consequence, singularities in these models cannot be considered as an\nexclusive product of General Relativity. It is difficult, however, to assess to which extent\nthis phenomenon denies validity to continuous models, although a simple remark once\nmade by H. Seifert [27] may be of help: on taking this point of view, one could discard\nthe big-bang of the standard model as being an artifact of Newtonian gravity, since\nFriedmann equation holds - formally unchanged - also for the Newtonian cosmological\nmodels.\nThe paper is organized as follows: section 2 is devoted to derive and the class of\nexact solutions, and to illustrate briefly some particular cases. Physical reasonability\nconditions will also be imposed to the solution, together with conditions that will ensure\nformation of singularities, whose endstate will be analyzed in section 3. In section 4\nwe will show how to complete the model, matching the solution to a suitable exterior\nspacetime. In the final section we discuss the results found, relating them to kinematical\nproperties of the spacetime.\n2. The solution in area\u2013radius coordinates\nThe general spherically symmetric line element in comoving coordinates (t, r, \u03b8i ), i =\n1, . . . , N \u2212 2, is given by\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03bd(t,r) dt2 + \u03b7(t, r)\u22121 dr 2 + R(t, r)2 d\u03a92N \u22122 ,\n\u0010Q\n\n(1)\n\n\u0011\n\nN \u22122\ni\u22121\n2 j\ni 2\nwhere d\u03a92N \u22122 \u2261 i=1\nj=1 sin \u03b8 (d\u03b8 ) . The source of the gravitational field will be\ngiven by an elastic material in isothermal conditions. Generalizing the N = 4 case , the\nproperty of the source are encoded in a state function depending on the space\u2013space part\nof the metric, that is \u2013 using spherical symmetry assumption \u2013 w = w(r, R, \u03b7) [15, 19].\nThe stress energy tensor is given by\n\u0010\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u0011\n\u2202\n+ pr dr \u2297\n+ pt d\u03b8i \u2297 i ,\n(2)\nT = \u2212\u01eb dt \u2297\n\u2202t\n\u2202r\n\u2202\u03b8\nwhere, introducing the matter density\n\nP\n\n\u221a\n\u03c1 = (N \u2212 2)(8\u03c0E)\u22121 \u03b7 R\u22122\n(E is an arbitrary function of r), the internal energy \u01eb and the stresses pr and pt are\ngiven in terms of the state function by\n\u2202w\n1\n\u2202w\n\u01eb = \u03c1 w, pr = 2\u03c1\u03b7\n, pt = \u2212\n\u03c1R\n.\n(3)\n\u2202\u03b7\nN \u2212 2 \u2202R\nAlthough the comoving coordinates usually yields the natural system to describe\nthe physical evolution of the collapse, for our purposes, however, it will be convenient\nto introduce the area\u2013radius coordinate system (r, R, \u03b8i ), first introduced by Ori [23] in\nthe study of 4-dimensional charged dust, in such a way that (1) becomes\nds2 = \u2212A dr 2 \u2212 2B dR dr \u2212 u\u22122 dR2 + R2 d\u03a92N \u22122 ,\n\n(4)\n\n\f4\n\nDimensional dependence of naked singularity formation\n\nwith A, B, u unknown functions of (r, R). In this way the internal energy will depend\nonly on one field variable, \u03b7, and on the two coordinates r, R. We introduce the function\n\u2206 = B 2 \u2212 Au\u22122 = \u03b7 \u22121 u\u22122 ,\nR\nr\nr\nso that Einstein field equations Grr = 8\u03c0Trr , GR\nr = 8\u03c0Tr and GR = 8\u03c0TR can be\nexpressed in terms of A, \u2206 and u as follows:\nN\n(5)\n(1 \u2212 )[(N \u2212 3)(1 \u2212 A/\u2206) \u2212 R(A/\u2206),R ] = 8\u03c0R2 pr ,\n2\n\u221a\nN\n(1 \u2212 )R\u22121 (A/\u2206),r = \u22128\u03c0 \u2206 + Au\u22122 u\u22122 (\u01eb + pr ),\n(6)\n2\nq\n\u221a\n(7)\nu2 + A/\u2206( \u2206),R \u2212 (u\u22121 ),r = 0.\n\nEquation (5) can be integrated to give A/\u2206 in terms of pr (r, R, \u03b7). Therefore, if one\nremoves dependency on the comoving field variables, assuming that pr in (3) satisfies\n\u2202pr (r, R, \u03b7)\n= 0,\n\u2202\u03b7\nor equivalently\nw = h(r, R) + l(r, R)\u03b7 \u22121/2\n\n(8)\n\nwith h, l arbitrary, then one obtains\nA = \u2206(1 \u2212 2\u03a8 R3\u2212N )\n\n(9)\n\nwhere, in view of (3) and (8), \u03a8 is the function\n\u03a8(r, R) = F (r) +\n\n1\nE(r)\n\nZ\n\nR\n\nR0 (r)\n\nl(r, \u03c3) d\u03c3,\n\n(10)\n\nwith F (r) arbitrary function of r, and R0 (r) describing r at initial (comoving) time,\nthat will be chosen equal to r hereafter. The function \u03a8 (10) is Misner\u2013Sharp mass of\nthe system, defined by the relation 1 \u2212 2\u03a8R3\u2212N = g(\u2207R, \u2207R). Now, inroducing\nY (r, R) = E(r) \u03a8,r (r, R) h(r, R)\u22121 ,\n\n(11)\n\nthe field equations (6)\u2013(7), in view of (3), (8) and (10), simply become respectively\n\u221a\n\nu2 = 2\u03a8R3\u2212N \u2212 1 + Y 2 ,\n\n(12)\n\nand ( \u2206),R + Y \u22121 (u\u22121),r = 0, that can be integrated, using the initial condition, to give\nZ R\n\u221a\nu,r (r, \u03c3)\n1\n\u2206(r, R) =\nd\u03c3\n+\n.\n(13)\nY (r, r)u(r, r)\nr Y (r, \u03c3)u(r, \u03c3)2\nThen, we conclude that the class of exact solutions found expresses all the metric\nunknown functions in (4) in terms of two arbitrary functions (\u03a8, Y ) of r and R.\nWe stress the fact that the constitutive function w(r, R, \u03b7) as equation of state,\nintroduced at the beginning of this section, uniquely and completely carries on the\nphysical properties of the matter, regardless of possible anisotropies. Isotropy of the\nmatter is characterized when w can be written as a function of the matter density \u03c1\n\n\fDimensional dependence of naked singularity formation\n\n5\n\nonly. In this case, pr = pt and both can be seen as a function of the energy density \u01eb only,\nas one can easily calculate from (3). When w fails to be a function of \u03c1 only, anisotropy\ncomes into play, but it is not needed any other relation to close the system, because\nof equations (3). Another way to see this is to observe that equations (3) identically\nimply the conservation law arising from one of the Bianchi identities written in comoving\ncoordinates, and again this is of course an outcome of having assumed that the source\nis an elastic continuum in isothermal conditions. Of course, the requirement given by\n(8) is exactly the state function characterizing the class of function considered, and the\nfact that the arbitrary functions can be viewed in terms of the kinematical properties of\nthe continuum is a very well known consequence of the structure of the field equations\nwithin the assumed symmetries and holds for all the models of this kind.\n2.1. Examples\nThe components of the stress energy tensor are generically nonzero, as readily calculated\nfrom (3)\u2013(10), and are given by\n\u221a\ni\nN \u2212 2 h \u03b7\u03a8,r\n+\n\u03a8\n(14)\n\u01eb=\n,R ,\n8\u03c0RN \u22122\nY\n(N \u2212 2)\u03a8,R\n,\n(15)\npr = \u2212\nN \u22122\n8\u03c0R\n\u221a\n\u03b7\n\u03a8,rR \u03a8,r \u2202Y\n\u03a8,RR\npt = \u2212\n(\n\u2212 2\n+ \u221a ).\n(16)\nN\n\u22123\n8\u03c0R\nY\nY \u2202R\n\u03b7\nFrom these expressions we can recognize some particular cases:\n(i) dust spacetimes [10], occurring when both \u03a8 and Y are functions of r only;\n(ii) vanishing radial stress solutions [20], that occur when \u03a8 is a function of r only, but\nY may also depend on R,\n(iii) acceleration free solutions, when Y is a function of r only but \u03a8 may also depend\non R (note that the norm of the acceleration is simply given by Y,R )\n2.2. Energy condition and shell focussing singularity occurrence\nOn the above class of solutions, some conditions will be imposed, as requirements on \u03a8\nand Y . Since we want to obtain global gravitational collapsing models, we will consider\nthe interior metric (4) as defined on a right neighborhood [0, rb ] of r = 0, for some\nrb > 0, and match the above solutions at r = rb with some exterior spacetime to be\ndefined later (see section 4). For this reason, in the following we will consider \u03a8 and Y\nas defined on the set {(r, R) : r \u2208 [0, rb ], R \u2208 [0, r]}.\nAs a physical reasonability condition, WEC on the metric (4) will be required, but\nin view of (14)\u2013(16), it suffices that\n\u03a8,r \u2265 0,\n\n\u03a8,R \u2265 0\n\n(N \u2212 2)\u03a8,r Y \u22121 \u2265 R(\u03a8,r Y \u22121 ),R ,\n\n(N \u2212 2)\u03a8,R \u2265 R\u03a8RR\n\n\fDimensional dependence of naked singularity formation\n\n6\n\nMoreover, we impose the condition of decreasing initial energy, i.e. \u01eb0 (r) := \u01eb(r, r) must\nbe a decreasing function of r:\n\u03a8,rr (r, r) + \u03a8,RR (r, r) + 2\u03a8,rR(r, r) \u2264\n\n(N \u2212 2)\n[\u03a8,r (r, r) + \u03a8,R (r, r)].\nr\n\nThe functions \u03a8 and Y must be chosen in such a way that the spacetime is regular at\ninitial (comoving) time, and a (shell focussing) singularity forms, for each shell r \u2208 [0, rb ],\nin a finite amount of time. Therefore, first of all shell\u221acrossing singularity formation must\nbe avoided, and to this aim it must be required that \u2206 > 0 when R \u2265 0. By inspection\nof (13), sufficient conditions for this to happen are given by\n\u221a\n\u2206(r, 0) > 0,\nu,r (r, R) > 0,\n\u2200r \u2208]0, rb ], R \u2208]0, r].\nMoreover, it must be observed that the use of the (r, R, \u03b8i ) coordinate system has\nthe obvious advantage to parameterize the singularity with the straight line R = 0, but\nthe drawback that both the regular and the singular centre are mapped into the point\nr = R = 0, and then it does not make a distinction between them, unless one does\nnot consider the inverse function t = t(r, R). The function \u1e58, the derivative of R w.r.t\ncomoving time, satisfies the identity u = \u2212\u1e58e\u2212\u03bd , that can be formally integrated to give\nR\nt(r, R) = Rr e\u2212\u03bd u(r, \u03c3) d\u03c3. Although the integrand yet contains an unknown function in\nthe comoving coordinates, a key remark at this stage is to observe that e\u2212\u03bd is bounded\nin a neighborhood of the centre, which allows to express the above conditions in terms\nof \u03a8 and Y : it suffices that the function RN \u22123 u2 is Taylor expandable at the centre\n(r = R = 0), with expression given by\nRN \u22123 u2 =\n\nX\n\ni+j=N \u22121\n\nhij r i Rj +\n\nX\n\nhij r i Rj + . . .\n\n(17)\n\ni+j=N \u22121+p\n\nIn particular, for the centre to become singular in a finite time, it must be required that\n(hN \u22121,0 , hN \u22122,1 , . . . , h1,N \u22122 ) 6= 0. Hereafter, we will suppose, as already done in [6],\n\u03b1 := hN \u22121,0 6= 0.\nAlthough this is a generic assumption, the results we are going to state can also be\nextended to the degenerate case \u03b1 = 0, as done in [29] for N = 4.\n3. Naked singularity vs. black hole formation\nThe endstate of the singularity for these models will be studied. First, let us observe\nthat the central singularity is the only one that can be naked. Indeed, under the above\nN\u22121\nN\u22121\n1\nassumptions, the apparent horizon Rh (r) is such that Rh (r) = \u03b1 N\u22123 r N\u22123 + o(r N\u22123 ), and\nmoreover, if th (r) and ts (r) are the comoving times when the shell labeled r becomes\ntrapped and singular, respectively, then limr\u21920+ th (r) \u2212 ts (r) = 0.\nTo analyze the endstate of the central singularity we will study existence of null\nradial geodesics Rg (r) emanating from the (singular) centre, such that Rg (r) > Rh (r) in\n\n\fDimensional dependence of naked singularity formation\n\n7\n\na right neighborhood of r = 0. To do that, we will use a remarkable property of Rh (r),\nto be a supersolution of null radial geodesic equation\n\u221a\ndR\n= u \u2206(Y \u2212 u).\n(18)\ndr\nTherefore, to have existence of such a Rg (r) as above, we will actually look for\nN\u22121\n1\nsubsolutions of (18) of the form Rx (r) = xr N\u22123 , with x > \u03b1 N\u22123 , that therefore emanate\nfrom the singular centre - so that Rg also will. Incidentally, this also explains why it\nsuffices to look for radial curves: indeed, the projection of a nonradial geodesic on the\n(r, R) plane would be a supersolution of (18), so if the singularity is nonradially naked,\nis also radially naked.\nAs it happens for the N = 4 case, the endstate of the singularity is related to Taylor\nexpansion of the function\n\u221a\n(19)\n\u2206(r, 0) = \u03ber n\u22121 + o(r n\u22121 ),\nbut also the dimension N of the spacetime will play now a crucial role. Indeed, the\n1\ncondition for the existence of Rx as above is equivalent to the existence of x > \u03b1 N\u22123\nsatisfying\nr\nr\nN(N\u22123)\n2\nN \u22121\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nn\u22121\n2\n).\n(20)\nxr N\u22123 < (1 \u2212\n)(\n\u03ber\n+\nxr\nN \u22123\nxN \u22123\nxN \u22123\nThe above inequality gives the complete spectrum of the endstates since it provides a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the singularity to be naked. Indeed, if N = 4 one\nrecovers the well known results of [6] that the inequality holds \u2013 and hence the singularity\nis naked \u2013 if n = 1, 2, and if n = 3 a critical case happens when the endstate is related\n\u221a\nto the value of \u03be in (19), since it must be 2\u03be > (26 + 5 3)\u03b1 for the singularity to be\nnaked. In larger dimensions, the singularity is naked if n = 1, \u2200N, and if n = 2, N = 5,\n\u221a\nprovided 2\u03be > 27 \u03b1. In all other cases a black hole forms. Then we observe that the\ncritical behavior, when a phase transition from black hole to naked singularity occurs,\ndepending on the value of \u03be, is a feature of dimensions N = 4, and N = 5, and is\nforbidden at larger dimensions. As one can see, the contribution of the dimension N,\nwhen it is larger than four, basically enters in the behavior of the apparent horizon,\nthat behaves like r 1+2/(N \u22123) , which is no more an integer power of r as N \u2265 6, and it\nis always leading upon the\n\u221a \"kinematical\" contribution of N \u2013 i.e. the last term in (20).\nSince the contribution of \u2206(r, 0) is always an integer power of r \u2013 see below \u2013 this fact\nresults in the lack of critical case when N \u2265 6.\n4. Exterior spacetime and matching conditions\nIn this section we will see how to complete the model, matching the interior solution\nstudied so far with an exterior spacetime, and requiring that Israel\u2013Darmois junction\nconditions hold along the matching hypersurface \u03a3 = {r = rb }. From (15) we observe\nthat radial pressure pr does not vanish in general along \u03a3, so we cannot expect to match\n\n\f8\n\nDimensional dependence of naked singularity formation\n\nN=7\n\nN=6\nN=5\n\nN=4\n\nFigure 1. Asymptotic behavior of the apparent horizon with respect to the dimension\nnear the centre. In the (r, R) plane, the shaded region represents the evolution of the\nsolution. Fixed the value for \u03b1, the higher N is, the bigger is the trapped region lying\nbetween the r\u2013axes and the horizon.\n\nthe solution with a Schwarzschild exterior. In this case a natural choice for the exterior\nmetric can be given by generalized Vaidya solutions [11, 28], that for generic N read\nds2ext\n\n2M(V, R)\n=\u2212 1\u2212\nRN \u22123\n\n!\n\ndV 2 \u2212 2 dR dV + R2 d\u03a92N \u22122 ,\n\nand Israel\u2013Darmois junction conditions simply become requirements on the mass\nfunction M(V, R) on the junction hypersurface.\nTo find the conditions, it is\nconvenient to work with the general interior metric written in comoving coordinates (1).\nParameterized \u03a3 with coordinates (\u03c4, \u03b8i ) \u0592\u2192 (\u03c4, rb , \u03b8i ), The first and second fundamental\nforms of \u03a3 w.r.t. this metric read\n2\u03bd\n2\n2\n2\nI\u03a3\nint = \u2212e d\u03c4 + R d\u03a9N \u22122 ,\n\n\u0010\n\n(21)\n\u0011\n\n1/2\ne2\u03bd \u03bd \u2032 d\u03c4 2 \u2212 R R\u2032 d\u03a92N \u22122 ,\nII\u03a3\nint = \u2212\u03b7\n\n(22)\n\nwhere a dash and a dot denote derivatives w.r.t. r and t respectively, and all functions\nare intended evaluated in (\u03c4, rb ). Injection of \u03a3 into the exterior spacetime reads\nin coordinates as (V (\u03c4 ), Y (\u03c4 ), \u03b8i ), where V (\u03c4 ), Y (\u03c4 ) must be determined. The first\nfundamental form of \u03a3\"takes the form\n!\n#\n2M(V (\u03c4 ), Y (\u03c4 ))\n2\n\u03a3\nV\u0307 (\u03c4 ) + 2V\u0307 (\u03c4 )\u1e8e (\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 2 +Y (\u03c4 )2 d\u03a92N \u22122 , (23)\nIext = \u2212 1 \u2212\nN\n\u22123\nY (\u03c4 )\nwhere, with a slight abuse of notation, we denote by a dot the derivative w.r.t. \u03c4 .\nComparing (21) with (23) gives\nY (\u03c4 ) = R(\u03c4, rb ),\n(24)\n\u0013\n2M\n1 \u2212 N \u22123 V\u0307 2 + 2V\u0307 \u1e8e = e2\u03bd , .\n(25)\nY\nUsing these relations we can express the second fundamental form of \u03a3 w.r.t. the exterior\nmetric as \u001a\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n1\n1\n1\n\u03a3\n2\n2\n2\n\u03bd\nd\u03c4 2\n\u2212\u1e8e V\u0308 \u2212 \u03c7,Y V\u0307 + V\u0307 \u0178 + \u03c7,Y \u1e8e V\u0307 + \u03c7 \u03c7,Y V\u0307 + \u03c7,V V\u0307\nIIext = \u2212e\n2\n2\n2\n\u0012\n\n\fDimensional dependence of naked singularity formation\no\n\n\u2212Y (\u1e8e + \u03c7V\u0307 )d\u03a92N \u22122 ,\n\n9\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03c7 = 1 \u2212 2MY 3\u2212N .

But,\nwith some algebra, the above relations together with field equation \u1e58\u2032 = \u03bb\u0307R\u2032 + \u03bd \u2032 \u1e58\nsimply reduce the condition to\nM,V (V (\u03c4 ), Y (\u03c4 )) = 0.\n\n(29)\n\nTherefore, we conclude that generalized Vaidya solutions can always be matched to a\nspherically symmetric interior metric (1) along \u03a3, provided that conditions (24) and\n(28) hold, and the mass function M(V, Y ) satisfies (27) and (29) on \u03a3.\nThe above fact can easily be translated in area\u2013radius formalism: it suffices to\nparameterize \u03a3 with coordinates (\u03c3, \u03b8i ) \u0592\u2192 (rb , \u03c3, \u03b8i ). In this case the injection of \u03a3 in\nthe exterior spacetime reads (V (\u03c3), \u03c3, \u03b8i ), where V (\u03c3), in view of (24)\u2013(29), becomes\n1\ndV\n=\n,\nd\u03c3\nu(rb, \u03c3)(u(rb , \u03c3) \u2212 Y (rb , \u03c3))\n\n(30)\n\nM(V (\u03c3), \u03c3) = \u03a8(rb , \u03c3),\n\n(31)\n\nand the mass function satisfies\n\nM,Y (V (\u03c3), \u03c3) = \u03a8,R (rb , \u03c3).\n\nIt can be observed that an interesting subclass of the above exterior metric is given\nby the anisotropic generalizations of deSitter spacetime [5], which is obtained taking\nM = M(Y ). Obviously, in this case condition (29) is trivially satisfied, and (31) simply\nreduces to require continuity of the mass across the junction hypersurface (see also [7]).\n5. Discussion and conclusions\nThere have been previous works trying to explain the endstate in terms of the\nkinematical properties of the spacetime, in particular the shear at initial time [10, 20].\nIn the following we are going to address this point, relating the indices\n\u221a n,\u03be coming from\n(19) to all kinematical properties (see also [4, 21]). The function \u2206(r, 0) can be split\nin the sum of I1 (r) + I2 (r), where\n1\n\u2202 r\n1\nd\u03c3,\nY (r, r) \u2202r 0 u(r, \u03c3)\n!\n!\nZ r\n1\n1\n1\nd\u03c3.\nI2 (r) :=\n\u2212\nY (r, \u03c3) Y (r, r)\nu(r, \u03c3) ,r\n0\n\nI1 (r) :=\n\nZ\n\n\fDimensional dependence of naked singularity formation\n\n10\n\nThe behavior of these quantities near the centre can be studied, to find that I1 (r) =\npar p\u22121 + o(r p\u22121), where p is given in (17), and a \u2208 R depends on the coefficients hij of\norder N \u2212 1 and N \u2212 1 + p.\nP\nIntroduced the polynomials Pk (\u03c4 ) = kj=0 hk\u2212j,j \u03c4 j , the value of a is given by\na=\u2212\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nPN \u22121+p (\u03c4 )\u03c4 1/(N \u22123)\nd\u03c4.\n2PN \u22121 (\u03c4 )3/2\n\nOn the other side, I2 (r) = br q + o(r q ), where b \u2208 R and q is the order of the first\nnonvanishing term of Y,R (r, R) expansion at the centre. Then, n in (19) is given by the\nsmallest between p and q + 1. Now, the shear of the solution can be controlled by the\nscalar\nq\n\u221a\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212u (N/2 \u2212 1)/(N \u2212 1)(log(R(u \u2206)\u22121 )),R\n2\nand on the initial slice R = r behaves like p\u03c30 r p + o(r p ), where \u03c30 =\nq\n(N/2 \u2212 1)/(N \u2212 1)(PN \u22121+p (1))/(4PN \u22121 (1))1/2 .\nWe deduce that the asymptotic\nbehavior of the shear near the regular centre can be responsible for the quantity\nI1 (r) only, and does not even control the value of the parameter a in the critical case\n(n = 2, N = 5) \u2013 not to tell that one can conceive cases when \u03c30 = 0. On the other side,\nthe norm of the acceleration is given simply by Y,R , and then it rules the quantity I2 (r),\nbut again the knowledge of the initial acceleration could not be enough to establish the\nvalue of q. We can conclude that the evolutions of both acceleration and shear influence\nthe endstate of the gravitational collapse,\n\u221a but none of them can be considered as a\nstand\u2013alone responsible, as the function \u2206(r, 0) is, together with the dimension N.\nWe observe that, if N \u2265 6, the singularity is naked only when n = 1. This\nis not in contrast with [10, 20], where dust and vanishing radial stress solutions are\nshown to produce a black hole when N \u2265 6. Indeed, the special\n\u221a case considered in\nthose paper are acceleration free, or more generally such that \u2206(r, 0) behaves like\nI1 (r) anyway, and so the endstate is related to the first nonvanishing power of RN \u22123 u2 ,\nafter the (N \u2212 1)\u2013th order. In the cases produced in [10, 20] the expansion for both\n\u03a8(r)/r N \u22121 and Y 2 is assumed to contain only even order terms, which excludes the\npossibility n = 1. Instead, in the case studied in the present paper a more general\nsituation is considered, when RN \u22123 u2 may contain both odd and even order terms, but\nonly terms of order N \u2212 1 + 2k, k \u2208 N, when restricted on the initial slice R = r.\nIn other words, solutions may be produced, when \u03a8/r N \u22121 and Y 2 are even at initial\ntime, but later they evolve to allow also for odd order terms. All in all, the conclusion\nstated for N = 4 in [6] is confirmed at higher dimensions, that the formation of naked\nsingularities or black holes weakly depends on the initial data, but is essentially a local\nphenomenon, depending on the Taylor expansion of a kinematical invariant near the\ncentre. The contribution of the dimension is basically related to the behavior of the\napparent horizon, that forbids occurrence of critical cases when N \u2265 6, and restricts,\nbut still allows for naked singularity formation at any dimension.\n\n\fDimensional dependence of naked singularity formation\n\n11\n\nReferences\n[1] J Bland et al, Dimension dependence of the critical exponent in spherically symmetric gravitational\ncollapse, Class.
