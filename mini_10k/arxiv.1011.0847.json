Embedded nanocrystals are formed,\nwhich either preserve the host structure (chemical decomposition) or give rise to precipitates (crystallographic\ndecomposition).3,4 Owing to a large concentration of the\nmagnetic constituent, these nanocrystals exhibit high ordering and blocking temperatures, typically above room\ntemperature and, therefore, control the magnetic properties of the system. The hybrid semiconductor/magnet\nnanocomposites formed in this way are expected to show\na number of striking functionalities,5,6 an example being\nthe electromotive force generated by magnetizing zincblende MnAs nanocrystals buried in GaAs.7 Since the\nTM d-levels reside in the gap, the aggregation process\ncan be controlled by changing the valence of the TM\nions by co-doping with donor or acceptor impurities.8,9\nIt has been also suggested that the trapping of carriers by\nTM ions could shift the Fermi level towards an impurity\nband formed by native defects, whose Stoner-like magnetism becomes more relevant than the one associated\ndirectly with the magnetic ions.10\nFurther progress in this field is possible by means of\nnondestructive spin-sensitive and element-specific map-\n\nping of the material properties with nanometric lateral\nand in-depth spatial resolutions. Here, by exploiting\nx-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and related techniques we obtain information on the local chemistry\nand magnetism of Fe-doped GaN, whose previous structural and magnetization studies pointed to a highly nonuniform Fe distribution and complex macroscopic magnetic properties already for a concentration of the magnetic ions below 0.5%.9,11\u201314 In particular, by x-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM), we demonstrate directly and in a non-destructive fashion the existence of Fe-rich nano-scale regions residing close to the\nsurface of (Ga,Fe)N epitaxial films. We then reveal ferromagnetic features in x-ray magnetic circular dichroism\n(XMCD) at both the Fe L- and N K-edges. We show that\nFe-N nanocrystals embedded in the GaN matrix stabilize\nthe ferromagnetism of (Ga,Fe)N at 300 K. Finally, we uncover the differences between the dominant FeN\u03b4 phases\nobtained by nanocrystal aggregation, and the iron nitride\nfilms obtained by direct deposition, where \u03b4 \u2248 0.25.15,16\nWe investigate (Ga,Fe)N films grown at the Kepler\nUniversity Linz-Austria by metal organic vapor phase\nepitaxy (MOVPE) on c-plane sapphire substrates.12,14\nWe concentrate on two samples deposited at the same\ntemperature Tg of 950\u25e6 C but under different flow-rates\nof the Fe-precursor (FeCp2 ): 100 and 300 standard cubic centimeters per minute (referred to as s100 and s300,\nrespectively).

The Fe L-edges shown in Fig. 2 are dominated by dipole transitions to the Fe 3d final states, seen\nin the form of intense \"white line\" peaks, each followed\nby a metallic continuum of final states.

After the cleaning procedure\nwe clearly identify the N K- Ga L- and Fe L-edges. The\nmeasurements are performed in the total electron yield\n(TEY) mode by measuring the photocurrent of the sample. The effective mean path of the electrons is of the\norder of 2 nm, implying that the region down to 6 nm\nbelow the sample surface is probed. To asses the average Fe concentration, we employ the high photon energy\natomic continuum of the Fe and N XAS spectra. A high\nmagnitude of the Fe density, in the order of 5%, is determined for the near surface region of sample (s300). For\nthe sample s300 XAS gives a 20% higher Fe content than\nfor the s100 film. In the XAS mode, XPEEM allows for\nchemical mapping of the near surface region by collecting secondary electrons emitted after photon absorption.\nWhen the incident photon energy corresponds to the absorption edge of an element on the surface or residing\ndown to several nanometers below, a significant increase\nis observed in the secondary electron emission from the\nareas where the specific element appears.

Though some regions 300 to 500 nm\nin diameter are present, where no bright spots appear,\nthe spatially resolved XAS reported in the right panel of\nFig. 1 confirms that these regions still contain iron. The\nconcentration of magnetic ions is confirmed to be not homogeneous and in the regions where the distance between\nthe Fe-rich nanocrystals is reduced, a bright halo is found\nconnecting the structures. These findings substantiate\nthe overall magnetization in terms of contributions from\ndilute paramagnetic Fe ions and magnetic nanocrystals\nwith high Fe-density.14\nFor averaged XAS and XMCD linear or close to circular polarization (with a degree of circular polarization of\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) XAS and XMCD spectra in TEY mode\nversus photon energy.

The XMCD difference\nspectra for (Ga,Fe)N samples s300 and s100 are reported in\nthe lower part (left scale). As reference the spectrum of bulk\nbcc Fe is shown (right scale). Lower inset: the dichroic signal\nof the Fe (4s) states for sample s300 is stronger in comparison\nto bulk Fe.\n\nThe exact photon energy of the Fe L-edges, its broadening and intensity are good markers of the electronic\nconfiguration of the Fe atoms. Here, the absolute photon energy and intensity is calibrated by using a bcc Fe\nreference sample measured in situ, within 0.1 eV. The\nincreased line width in comparison to bcc Fe - as reported in the inset to Fig. 2 - is indicative of inhomogeneous broadening, consistent with Fe atoms in several\ndifferent local environments and crystallographic phases,\nand supporting the transmission electron microscopy and\nsynchrotron x-ray diffraction data.14 Interestingly, in a\nsimilar manner, by means of XAS and XMCD, two distinct local environments for Mn atoms in (Ga,Mn)N films\nhave been proposed, leading to a broadening of the Mn\nL-edge white lines when increasing the dilution of Mn in\nGaN.17 The broadening in the L edge \"white lines\" of\nFe observed here, corresponds to a variation in the Fe\nbinding energy. Such an effect has been observed earlier\nfor FeN\u03b4 films.18 The magnetic phase with \u03b4 = 0.25 is\n\n\f3\n\nsample\n\n(Ga,Fe)N s300\n(Ga,Fe)N s100\nFe bulk (bcc)\nFeN0.25 (2 ML)16\nFeN0.25 (4 ML)16\n\nnumber of\n3d holes\n\nmagnetic moments\n(\u03bcB /Fe atom)\nunder field\nin remanence\nnh\nms\nml /ms ms ml /ms\n4.1(1)\n0.44(4) 0.00(1) 0.15(2) 0.13(1)\n4.5(1)\n0.31(3) 0.00(1)\n3.8\n1.98\n0.045\n3.80(15) 1.38(10) 0.13(5)\n3.80(15) 1.98(10) 0.12(5)\n\nB+C+/D7/+&+207E/+D/F/0D/0A/ : ;:\n+G H\n+% H\n\"\n\n!\"\n!#\n\n4!-!3.2+1+*0/..-,+)*)('\n\nTABLE I: Parameters determined by the XMCD sum rules.\nThe errors shown are relative, versus bcc Fe.

This finding demonstrates that\nthe robust ferromagnetism at 300 K originates primarily from nanocrystals with a lower degree of nitridation.\nGiven the correlation between the orbital moment and\nthe magnetic anisotropy,20 a non zero orbital in remanence, indicates that here a minority of nanocrystals with\n\u03b4 > 0.25 possessing a larger orbital moment is essential\nin stabilizing the ferromagnetic response at 300 K.\n\n!$\n\n#\n+++++D?@@/./0A/+?0*/0I?*8+\n3/*J//0+G +20D+% +D/7.//\n\n!%\n!\n\n$\n\n+I/A)0D+D/.?L2*?L/\n+++\n%\n++)@+*(/+B+C&/D7/+(2E@+I-K\nK/2I-./D+2*+% +D/7+7.2M?07\n+\n\n& !%\n& !$\n\nThe XMCD response has been recorded at 300 K under\nan applied in-plane field of \u00b1800 Oe or in remanence at\nan x-ray incidence of 20\u25e6 , 45\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 with respect to the\nsample surface. The XMCD signal at various angles allows to identify the presence of different types of dichroic\nresponse, consistent with the observed broadening of the\nwhite line and the XPEEM data. Furthermore, the signal under remanence indicates an in plane easy direction.\nWe note that XMCD dichroic spectra, as shown in Fig. 2,\nin addition to the contribution from Fe(3d) spin polarization, may contain a component originating from transitions to Fe(4s) states, becoming evident in the spectral\nregion between the L3 and the L2 lines. Actually, the\nso-called \"s-state\" dichroic contribution is stronger for\n(Ga,Fe)N than for the bulk Fe, as reported in the inset\nto Fig. 2. This addresses the significance of the 4s \u2212 3d\nhybridization in ferromagnetic Fe atoms with N atoms as\nfirst neighbors, in particular within the FeN\u03b4 nanocrystals. The results of the XMCD quantitative analysis are\nsummarized in Table I, together with XMCD data for\nFeN0.25 .16 The relatively small magnitude of the determined spin moment per Fe ion, namely ms \u2264 0.44 \u03bcB appears inconsistent with the majority of Fe atoms in a high\nspin state. The small moment value may indicate that\nthe magnetic anisotropy of the larger FeN\u03b4 nanocrystals\nis strong enough for those to be fully polarized in 800 Oe\nat 300 K. A small magnetic moment value is also consistent with the existence of smaller particles and antiferromagnetic interactions appearing at \u03b4 \u2265 0.5.14 In\norder to determine the relative magnitude of the orbital\n\n&5\n\n4!-!3.21+/A0/./@@?>+>,=<\n\nlinked to lower Fe binding energies, as we find here.18\nFrom the \"XMCD-sum rules\",19 we determine the number of 3d holes for (Ga,Fe)N, obtaining values larger than\nthose found in literature for FeN\u03b4 , \u03b4 \u2264 0.25,16 implying\na substantial degree of Fe nitridation. The increased average number of 3d holes demonstrates that some of the\nFe atoms are in the 3d5 state.\n\n++<=,>+)3*2?0/D+@).+IF/A*.2+ &%\nK/2I-./D+-0D/.+2FFE?/D+@?/ED\n+G H\n+% H\n&$\n\n& !#\n& !\"\n5\"\n\n$\n\n$%\n\n'()*)0+60/.78+1+/9+4\n\n$$\n\n$#\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) N K-edge for the (Ga,Fe)N sample\ns300 (left scale), with 1.0 subtracted, taken with linear x-rays\nat normal (90\u25e6 ) and grazing (20\u25e6 ) x-ray incidence versus the\nfilm plane. The corresponding difference spectra are shown:\nnegative peaks (left scale) indicate s \u2192 pz states, positive\npeaks - s \u2192 px , py . Also shown is the XMCD difference, taken\nwith circular x-rays, for spectra at normal and grazing x-ray\nincidence (right scale) under an applied field of \u00b1800 Oe. The\nsecond derivative of the N XAS spectrum at grazing incidence\nis shown, as it reproduces the oscillatory part of the XMCD\nsignal, pointing to some itinerant character of the final states.\n\nThe N(2p) final states are probed via XAS at the N Kedge21 and the spectra are shown in Fig. 3. A shoulder at\nthe low energy side of the edge is attributed to hybridization with the Fe electronic states. The high structural\nquality of the semiconductor matrix is confirmed by the\ndependence of the spectra versus x-ray incidence angle\nwhen linearly polarized x-rays are used. In general, Kedges lead to rather small XMCD effects. Nevertheless,\nwe observe a clear XMCD response from the N atoms in\nthe magnetic field. Previously, XMCD at the N K-edge\nwas observed for GdN.22 Using resonant reflectivity, N\n\n\f4\nK-edge x-ray circular dichroism was detected for Fe-N\nin its \u03b3 \u2032 -FeN0.25 phase.15 The observed XMCD proves\ndirectly the presence of electron and spin-polarization\ntransfer from Fe to neighboring anions, presumably via\nspin-dependent hybridizations between N(2p), Fe(3d),\nand Fe(4s) states. In particular, in the presence of Fe,\na clear XMCD effect is seen around 397 eV at the pre\nedge region of the N K-edge, which corresponds to the\nforbidden energy range within the band gap. Furthermore, a strong angular dependence is observed in the N\nK edge XMCD signal at higher energies, around 403 eV.\nHere, more dichroic intensity is obtained at normal x-ray\nincidence. As a comparison, the GdN XMCD data indicate also a signal of a comparable intensity, about 0.5%\nof the N atomic high photon energy continuum step.22\nThis appears surprising as the concentration of N atoms\ninvolved here in the magnetic response is expected to be\nmuch smaller, even though we probe the surface region\nwhere the density of FeN\u03b4 nanocrystals is high. However, the hybridization between N(2p) and Fe(3d) states\nis expected to be stronger than with the highly localized\nGd(4f ) orbitals via Gd(5d) states. The XMCD signal in\nFig. 3 appears to consist of two contributions: an oscillatory part is superimposed to broader N(2p) localized features, reemphasizing the presence of different magnetic\nphases. Following an earlier work23 we plot the second\nderivative of the XAS spectrum. Agreement is observed\nwith the oscillatory part of the XMCD signal, suggesting\n\n\u2217\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nElectronic address: ikowalik@ifpan.edu.pl\nH.

One determines from the spectra\nof Fig. 3 an exchange splitting energy of about 0.9 eV\nthat falls within the expected range for itinerant magnetism, eventually indicating that the FeN\u03b4 nanocrystals\npolarize also atoms in their near vicinity, giving reason\nfor the large XMCD signal and its angle dependence.\nIn summary, we characterize the distribution, chemistry and magnetism of FeN\u03b4 nanocrystals aggregating in\na self-organized manner in epitaxial layers of (Ga,Fe)N.\nThese nanocrystals have a diameter below 50 nm, reside\nprimarily close to the surface and are characterized by\nvarious degrees of nitridation. We quantify the impact\nof the degree of nitridation on the orbital moment and\nthe stability of ferromagnetism at 300 K. Depending on\nthe growth conditions, (Ga,Fe)N may serve to develop\nnanocomposite spintronic systems characterized by either robust room temperature ferromagnetism (\u03b4 \u2264 1/3)\nor strong antiferromagnetic interactions (\u03b4 > 1/2).\nWe acknowledge the EC support through the\nFunDMS Advanced Grant of the ERC within the\n\"Ideas\" 7th Framework Programme, the Austrian Fonds\nzur F\u00f6rderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung-FWF\n(P22477, P18942, P20065 and N107-NAN), the Swedish\nResearch Council, the EC ARI program for access to\nMAX-lab, A.
