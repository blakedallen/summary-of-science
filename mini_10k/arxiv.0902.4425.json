The peak was thus associated to a pentaquark, since\nthe standard 3q states cannot produce S=1. Subsequently, many experiments were done,\nsome which reproduced this peak and others which did not, and the issue stimulated a\nlarge number of theoretical works that gave a huge impetus to the field of hadron structure\n(see the extensive list of references, for example, in [2,3]). Waters calmed down, a thorough\nexperimental review was written in [4] and a period of rest followed till a new experimental\nanalysis was done at LEPS confirming the original peak, now on a deuteron target and\nwith more statistics [5]. Although one cannot rule out an interpretation of the peak as a\nconsequence of the particular set up of LEPS, no alternative conventional explanation for\nthis peak has been provided.\n\u2217\n\nkanchan@teor.fis.uc.pt\namartine@ific.uv.es\n\u2021\noset@ific.uv.es\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fOn the theoretical side most of the works concentrated on finding possible states of five\nquarks (pentaquark). From the perspective of the meson-baryon interaction the situation\ndoes not look encouraging, since the KN interaction obtained from chiral Lagrangians is\nbasically repulsive in nature [6], and one does not expect to find a narrow (long lived)\nresonance, as the one claimed in [1], in this system. This is why very early there were\nsuggestions that if the peak represented a new state it could be a bound state of three\nhadrons, K\u03c0N, with the pion acting as a glue between the nucleon and the K, which\nwould only be bound by about 30 MeV. However, investigations along this line, weakly\nconcluded the difficulty to have this system as a bound state [7, 8].\nThe purpose of this paper is to perform a thorough calculation of the K\u03c0N system\nusing Faddeev equations to see the possibility to find bound states or resonances. The\ninterest in the three hadron systems is old. In [9] there was already a study of such\npossible systems based only on symmetries. However, recently a qualitative step forward\nhas been taken in this topic, which has been made possible by combining elements of\nunitarized chiral perturbation theory U\u03c7P T [10\u201316] with Faddeev equations in coupled\nchannels [17]. In [17, 18] systems of two mesons and one baryon with strangeness S = \u22121\nwere studied, finding resonant states which could be identified with two \u039b and four \u03a3\nknown low-lying resonances with J P = 1/2+ . Similarly, in the case of the S = 0 sector\nthe N \u2217 (1710) appears neatly as a resonance of the \u03c0\u03c0N system, as well as including the\nchannels coupled to \u03c0\u03c0N within SU(3) [19]. The study in S = 0 sector was further extended\nby using the experimental data on the \u03c0N scattering and by adding more coupled channels\nin [20], the outcome of which was the dynamical generation of three resonances, one with\nquantum numbers of the N \u2217 (2100), another with those of the \u2206 (1910), plus a new N \u2217 at\n\u223c 1920 MeV (also predicted by Jido et. al. [21]).\nDevelopments along the same direction in three-meson system produced a resonant state\nof \u03c6K K\u0304 [22] which could be identified with the X(2175) resonance reported at BABAR\n[23, 24] and later on at BES [25].\nThe achievements obtained in the former studies and especially the finding of several\nlow-lying S =-1 resonances with two meson-one baryon structure motivates us to have a\nfresh look at the \u03c0KN system using our formalism and to make a thorough investigation\nof the possibility to have the system bound. This is the purpose of the present paper. As\nwe will show in the following section, we do not get the system bound in the region of\nthe possible S=1 state of [1]. At higher energies a bump appears which, however, does\nnot have the ordinary shape of the resonances that we have found in other channels. This\ncould correspond to some of the bumps seen using the time delay method in the analysis\nof the KN system in [26].\n\n2\n\nFormalism and Results\n\nWe solve the Faddeev equations for the N\u03c0K system following the formalism developed\nin [17\u201319], in which it was shown that the integral Faddeev equations can be rewritten as a\ncoupled system of algebraic equations using unitary chiral dynamics. The main feature of\n2\n\n\fthis approach is the explicit cancellation between the contribution of the off-shell part of the\ntwo-body t-matrices in the three-body diagrams and the corresponding three-body contact\nterm originating from the same chiral Lagrangians. Due to this peculiarity, the Faddeev\nequations can be transformed into the following set of coupled channel equations [17, 19]\nh\n\ni\n\nh\n\ni\n\nTR12 = t1 g 12 t2 + t1 G 121 TR21 + G 123 TR23\nh\n\nTR13 = t1 g 13 t3 + t1 G 131 TR31 + G 132 TR32\nTR21 = t2 g 21 t1 + t2 G 212 TR12 + G 213 TR13\nh\n\nTR23 = t2 g 23 t3 + t2 G 231 TR31 + G 232 TR32\nh\n\nTR31 = t3 g 31 t1 + t3 G 312 TR12 + G 313 TR13\nh\n\nTR32 = t3 g 32 t2 + t3 G 321 TR21 + G 323 TR23\n\ni\n\ni\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere ti , i = 1, 2, 3, represents the two-body t-matrices, which have been obtained by\nsolving the Bethe-Salpeter equation in a coupled channel formalism. The required kernels,\ni.e., the potentials which describe the interaction of the different pairs of the system are\ncalculated using chiral Lagrangians [13, 27, 28]. In Eq. (1), g ij is the three-body Green's\nfunction of the system and Gijk is a loop function of three-particles (see [17, 19] for more\ndetails). The matrices ti , g ij and Gijk are all projected in S-wave, thus giving total J P =\n1/2+ .\nThe TRij partitions consider all the different contributions to the three-body T - matrix\nin which the last interactions are given in terms of the two-body t-matrices tj and ti ,\nrespectively. The TRij matrices are related to the Faddeev partitions T i through\nT i = ti \u03b4 3 (~ki\u2032 \u2212 ~ki ) +\n\n3\nX\n\nTRij ,\n\ni = 1, 2, 3\n\n(2)\n\nj6=i=1\n\nwhere ~ki (~ki\u2032 ) is the initial (final) momentum of the particle i. Thus, the full three-body\nT -matrix is given by\nT =\n\n3\nX\n\nTi =\n\ni=1\n\nTR \u2261\n\n3\n3\nX\nX\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\nti \u03b4 3 (~ki\u2032 \u2212 ~ki ) + TR\n\nTRij\n\n(3)\n\ni=1 j6=i=1\n\nAs our objective is to search for peaks in the T -matrix which can be associated with\nphysical states, we can restrict ourselves to the study of the properties of\nTR\u2217 \u2261 TR \u2212\n\n3\n3\nX\nX\n\nti g ij tj\n\n(4)\n\ni=1 j6=i=1\n\nsince neither ti \u03b4 3 (~ki\u2032 \u2212 ~ki ) nor the ti g ij tj terms can give rise to any three-body resonance.\n3\n\n\fWe study the N\u03c0K system for total charge +1 taking into account four channels to solve\nEqs.

For the\n\u03c0N system and its coupled channels for total charge zero, which dynamically generate the\nN \u2217 (1535), the coefficients Cij can be found in [27], while for the KN system in [28].

We have calculated the TR matrices for the energy range 1500 MeV\n< s < 2100 MeV, with the motivation to find some structure around 1540 MeV, and for\n\u221a\n600 < s23 < 1100 MeV to generate dynamically the \u03ba (800) in the KN subsystem in\norder to have some attractive interaction in the three-body system.\nWe do not find any resonance in the isospin 1 and 2 configurations. We obtain one\npeak with a broad structure in the squared amplitude in isospin zero (i.e., when the \u03c0K\nsubsystem is in isospin 1/2) around 1720 MeV. The full width at half maximum of the peak\nis of the order of 200 MeV. These features have nothing in common with the resonance\n\u221a\nclaimed in [1]. The value of s23 , for which the bump is found, is around the mass of\nthe \u03ba (800) resonance. We show this peak in Fig.1, where we plot the amplitude square\nfor the total isospin zero. As is evident from the figure, the structure of the peak is far\nfrom a Breit-Wigner. Though the strength of this amplitude is similar to that of the\ncorresponding S = -1 case [17], its shape is different from those of the clear resonances\nfound in the latter. Its unconventional peaking behaviour cast doubts whether this peak\ncould have a pole associated in the complex plane, the accepted criterium to define a peak\nas a resonance. The technique to extrapolate the amplitudes to the complex plane with the\ntwo variables that we have is not available and looks nontrivial, since it involves working\nwith complex momenta for some particles and real for others. Yet, independently from\nwhether the structure found deserves or not to be called a resonance, the fact remains that\nthe chiral dynamics of this coupled channel three-body system leads to such a bump in the\ncross section in a region where the system clusters like a \u03ba and a nucleon. This peak should\nbe visible in KN scattering with the quantum numbers I = 0, J P = 1/2+ , but even better\nin the KN \u2192 \u03c0KN reaction, since the peak appears well above the \u03c0KN threshold, or in\n5\n\n\fany reaction producing \u03c0KN in I = 0 in the final state.\n\n*2\n\n-10\n\n|TR | (x 10\n\n-6\n\nMeV )\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n700\n800\n\u221as23 (MeV)\n\n900\n1000\n1100\n\n1400\n1600 1500\n1800 1700\n1900\n2100 2000\n\u221a s (MeV)\n\nFigure 1: The isospin zero amplitude squared for the N\u03c0K system as a function of the\ntotal energy and the invariant mass of the \u03c0K subsystem.\nInterestingly, a broad structure at around 1800 MeV seems to be present in the data [29]\nof K + N scattering in the P01 partial wave and in the time delay analysis of these data [26],\nwhich could correspond to the peak shown in Fig.1.\n\n3\n\nSummary\n\nThe possibility of existence of strangeness +1 baryon with a strong coupling to the N\u03c0K\nsystem has been investigated by solving Faddeev equations in the formalism which has\ngenerated dynamically many strange and non strange resonances in three-body systems.\nWe do not find any structure in the energy region close to 1542 MeV, therefore, the\ninterpretation of a possible \u0398+ as a N\u03c0K bound state, with all the interactions in s-wave,\nis ruled out. A bump is found around 1720 MeV with about 200 MeV of width and with\nisospin zero, which reveals the underlying chiral dynamics of the three-body system, and\nthat we hope can be seen in K + N scattering, but much better in reactions producing \u03c0KN\nin I = 0 in the final state. Our study should stimulate experimental work in this direction.\n\n6\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThis work is partly supported by DGICYT contract number FIS2006-03438.
