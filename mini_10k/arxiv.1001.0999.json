Rashba spin-orbit interaction; C. Disorder; D. Spin Nernst Effect; D. seebeck coefficient\n\nWith the development of the micro-fabrication technology and the low-temperature measurement technology, a\ngreat amount of efforts have been paid for the research of\nthe thermoelectric properties in the last two decades2,3 .\nComparing to the conductance, the thermoelectric coefficients of electronic systems are more sensitive to the\ndetails of the density of states4\u20136 , which is very important\nfor the design of the electronic devices. The thermopower\n(seebeck coefficient) of the quantum dot was measured in\nthe last few years2. Recently, the Nernst effect, a Halllike thermal effect, has been theoretically studied7 and\nhad been detected, for example, in bismuth8 in which,\nwith the existence of a perpendicular magnetic field, a\ntransverse current is induced by the longitudinal thermal gradient.\nIn the spintronics area, the spin thermal coefficients\nare also of focus recently4\u20136 . In a recent paper, by considering a system with a spin-orbit interaction (SOI), the\nNernst effect and a novel thermal effect, the spin Nernst\neffect, have been fully studied in a two-dimensional electron gas9 . It is found that, because of a perpendicular\nmagnetic field B, the Nernst signal exhibits a series of\npeaks. When the SOI exists, the peaks split and the spin\nNernst effect appears. With a small B or a large SOI,\nthe spin Nernst effect becomes more pronounced. It also\nshows that the spin Nernst effect is easier to be affected\nby disorder than the Nernst effect.\nThere is no doubt that a perpendicular magnetic field\nB is essential for the existence of the Nernst effect. However, in the spin Hall effect, the transverse spin current is\ndue to a SOI rather than a perpendicular magnetic field.\nSimilarly, for the spin Nernst effect, B may not be needed\neither. One may suspect that the spin Nernst effect is in\nfact the combination of the existence of thermopower and\na SOI. Thus, the focus of the current work is to study\nthe spin Nernst effect in the absence of a perpendicular\nmagnetic field, and its interplay with the thermopower.\nIn this paper, the property of spin Nernst effect is developed in a two-dimensional electron gas system with a\nRashba SOI but without a perpendicular magnetic field\nB. For this set-up, the Nernst effect disappears thus we\n\nfocus on the spin Nernst effect \u2013 a transverse spin current induced by a longitudinal thermal gradient \u2206T . A\ntraditional way to analyze such a Hall-like system is to\nadd vertical probes to detect the transverse properties.\nThus we set a four-terminal cross-bar sample, as shown\nin Fig.19 . A longitudinal thermal gradient \u2206T is added\nbetween the leads 1 and 3. This thermal gradient induces\na transverse spin current Js in the closed boundary condition with a SOI, which can be measured at leads 2 and 4.\nThe seebeck coefficient of such a system can be directly\nmeasured at leads 1 and 3.\nBy using a tight-binding model and the LandauerButtiker (LB) formula, the spin Nernst coefficient Ns\n(Ns \u2261 Js /\u2206T ) and the seebeck coefficient S (S \u2261\n\u2212\u2206V /\u2206T ) are calculated. The Rashba SOI used in our\ncalculations covers a wide range with some beyond the\naccessibility of today's sample. The seebeck coefficient S\nshows a few peaks consequently when the fermi energy\nEF goes through the energy band. Due to the interface\nof our setting (zero Rashba SOI at lead 2,4), we find a\nnegative S. It is confirmed that spin Nernst effect can\nnot be simply thought as the combination of the seebeck\ncoefficient and the Spin hall effect9 . A big spin Nernst\ncoefficient Ns can be found with a zero seebeck coefficient S. However, when the peaks of seebeck coefficient\noccur with a non-zero Rashba SOI, the spin Nernst effect exhibits big amplitude or sometimes also peaks. The\nFermi energy EF also affects Ns . When the Fermi energy\nEF is close to the bottom of the energy band (\u22124t), the\noscillatory amplitude of Ns becomes more pronounced.\nThe effect of disorder on Ns is also investigated. When\nEF = \u22123.8t, we can see a large increase of Ns with increasing of the strength of disorder. Its value at the peak\nis about three-fold of that without disorder. In addition,\nwe find that the strength of disorder when Ns vanishes,\nindicating that the system goes into an insulating regime,\nis independent of the Fermi energy.\nIn the tight-binding representation, the Hamiltonian\n\n\f2\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nV =0.02\nR\n\nV =0.05\nR\n\n0.1\n\nNs & S\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(c)\n\nwith SOI can be written as:10 ,\nX \u2020\nX \u2020\nH =\n\u03b5i ci\u03c3 ci\u03c3 +\n[ci+\u03b4y,\u03c3 (\u2212tI \u2212 i\u03c3x VR )\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ci\u03c3\u2032\ni\u03c3\n\n(d)\n\nV =0.1\nR\n\nV =0.45\nR\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nNs & S\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic diagram of the four-terminal cross-bar\nsample.

VR is set to\nzero in the lead-2 and lead-4.\nConsidering a small temperature gradient \u2206T on the\nlongitudinal lead-1,3, we can set the temperatures T1 =\nT + \u2206T /2, T3 = T \u2212 \u2206T /2, T2 = T4 = T . The charge\ncurrent in lead-p can be written as Jpe = e(Ip\u2191 + Ip\u2193 ) and\nthe spin current is Jps = (~/2)(Ip\u2191 \u2212 Ip\u2193 ). Here Ip\u03c3 is\nthe particle current in lead-p with \u03c3 equals to \u2191 or \u2193.

For example, with\na perpendicular magnetic field B, the longitudinal seebeck coefficient S is affected by the bias in leads-2,4,\nV2 and V4 . However, without B, the sample's symmetry increases from C2 symmetry to D2 symmetry, i.e.,\nwe have T1,2 = T1,4 , Here T1,2 = T1\u2191,2 + T1\u2193,2 .

The D2 symmetry gives \u2206T23 = \u2212\u2206T21 . Noticing T3\u2191,1 = T3\u2193,1 ,\nthe spin Nernst\ncoefficient can be simplified as Ns =\n\u0001\u000e\nA\u2193 \u2212 A\u2191 (2\u03c0kB T ). Here \u03b5 = E \u2212 EF and F (\u03b5) =\nf (1 \u2212 f ), a\u2191 denotes the spin up term: a\u2191 = T2\u2191,1 +T3\u2191,1 ,\nand a\u2193 the spin down term a\u2193 = T2\u2193,1 +RT3\u2193,1 , we also \u000euse\n\u2191\n\u2191\nthe notation\nR of the integral\n\u000e term A = dE\u03b5F (\u03b5) a T\n\u2193\n\u2193\nand A = dE\u03b5F (\u03b5) a T . Because of the symmetry,\nonly leads-1,2,3 are used in the simplified expression of\nS and Ns , we only need the upper half of the sample for\nour investigation. In fact, a\u2191 (a\u2193 ) and A\u2191 (A\u2193 ) reflects\ntransport properties of spin-up (spin-down) electrons in\nthe upper half of the sample. Roughly speaking, S can\nbe seen as the sum of spin-up and spin-down terms, while\nNs as the difference of them.\nIn the numerical calculations, t = ~2 /(2m\u2217 a2 ) is set\nas the energy unit. If taking the effective electron mass\nm\u2217 = 0.05me and the lattice constant a = 12.5nm, t\nis about 5meV . Temperature is fixed by kB T = 0.01t,\nwhich is about 1K. The size of center region is L = 19a,\nabout 237nm. In a reasonable experimental range thus\nfar VR \u2208 [0, 0.1]12 . However, in order to thoroughly study\nthe relationship between the spin Nernst coefficient Ns\nand the seebeck coefficient S, we extend the range of\nVR up to [0, 1] in our calculation.\nFig.2 shows the spin Nernst coefficient Ns and the seebeck coefficient S versus the Fermi Energy EF in the\nclean system (W = 0). It is clearly seen that the see-\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nV\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nR\n\nFIG. 4: (Ns (red solid) and S (black dashed) vs. Rashba SOI\nVR for fermi energy EF = \u22123. For compare, the blue dotted\nline shows the seebeck when lead-2,4 have the same VR as\nlead-1,3. The other parameters are T = 0.01, and L = 19a.\n\nbeck coefficient S peaks at the positions where there\nare step-changes of transmission function T1,2 + T1,4 .\nThese peaks can be explained by a simple model only\nwith a 2-lead system without the Rashba SOI, shown in\nFig.3(a). The transmission coefficient T1,3 is a step function (solid-black curve). The reason is as follows. The\nsample can be considered as a multi-channel system at\na low temperature (here T \u223c 1K). When fermi energy\nincreases, more channels in the lead are used to transport current. Thus, \u2206V of two leads as well as the current increase with increasing of fermi energy (red-dashed\ncurve). However, the S (blue-dotted curve) can not accumulates while EF increases, it only peaks while the\nchannel number changes and S is close to zero with a\nfixed channel number. This can be seen from the LB\nformula (2), if lead-p and lead-q have different temperatures, fp (E, T +\u2206T )\u2212fq (E, T \u2212\u2206T ) is an antisymmetry\nfunction of E \u2212 EF (see plot in small box of Fig.3(a)):\nwhen E < EF , fp < fq , current flows from lower temperature lead to higher temperature one; when E > EF ,\ncurrent flows in the opposite direction. Only when the\ntwo flows are not equal, i.e. Tp\u03c3,q has an antisymmetry\npart, we can have a nonzero current. Thus for Fig.3(a),\nonly when T1,3 is at the step-change point, it has antisymmetry part and can give a non-zero S.\nThis conclusion can also be used to analyst spininvolved quantities. From Fig.2, we can see that Ns (red\nsolid line) shows an oscillatory structure. Besides the\npeaks at VR = 0 (Ns is zero at this point), the magnitude of Ns oscillation is also large at the peaks of S;\nbut at the exact maximum point of S, where VR is quite\nsmall (VR . 0.1), Ns is generally close to zero. This is\nbecause the spin transmission coefficient \u2206T2,3 generally\nhas an extreme value when the transmission coefficient\n\n\f4\n.15\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0.025\n0.1\n0.02\n0.05\n0.03 N\n\nNs 0.01\n\ns\n\n0\n0\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.005\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nW\n\n\u22123.8 \u22123.6 \u22123.4 \u22123.2 \u22123\n\nE\n\nF\n\nFIG. 5: (a).

Around an extreme value, any function is almost symmetry, thus one only can get a low\nvalue of Ns . While at both sides of the extreme value,\n\u2206T2,3 monotonically increases or decreases, we can get\na local maximum magnitude of Ns . Now why \u2206T2,3 has\nan extreme value at a peak of S for a small VR . Due\nto the Rashba SOI, each eigen-energy band splits into\ntwo sub-bands with opposite spin directions. These two\nsub-bands degenerate at ky = 0, and the lower sub-band\nhas two valleys below this degenerate point. The two\nsub-bands are very close to each other when VR is small.\nIf the lower sub-band of high level (for example, E1,ky )\nhas the similar spin direction with the upper sub-band of\nlow level energy (for example, E0,ky ), \u2206T2,3 continually\nincreases when EF goes from the upper band of E0,ky\nto the two valleys of lower sub-band of E1,ky , and than\nrapidly decreases when EF goes through the degenerate\npoint (ky = 0) of E1,ky , thus we get a peak in \u2206T2,3 ;\notherwise we get a valley in \u2206T2,3 .\nWhen VR is very big, we can see the external peaks\nfor both Ns and S. For example VR = 0.45 in Fig.2(d),\nclose to the 2nd and 3rd main peaks of S, we can see\na very sharp sub-peak of Ns . In fact, these are also the\nsmall peaks of S, though not very big. This is because for\nthese two band (see Fig.3(c)), the two valleys of the lower\nsub-band is far from the degenerate point at ky = 0, the\ntwo channel of these two sub-bands is separated. Thus\nwe can see two peaks. At this time, the change of spin\ntransmission coefficients can be roughly thought as the\nchange of transmission coefficients, thus we can see Ns\npeaks at the S's peak.\nIn Fig.4, we show the spin Nernst coefficient Ns and\n\nthe seebeck coefficient S versus the Rashba SOI VR in\nthe clean system (W = 0) for EF = \u22123. The seebeck\ncoefficient S decreases and maintains for a small value for\nquite a while before shows another peak. This is because\nincreasing VR moves the energy bands and makes them\ngo through the fermi energy. It should be mentioned\nthat we found the negative seebeck coefficient S (Fig.\n2d), which means a longitudinal current occurs in the\nopposite direction of the temperature gradient \u2206T . This\nis due to the boundary conditions VR = 0 at leads-2,4.\nAs a compare, we also show S for a uniform system,\ni.e. leads-2,4 having the same strength of VR as in the\nsample. For this situation, the seebeck coefficient S is no\nlonger negative. In fact, when the Rashba SOI is absent\nin the leads-2,4, an interface between VR = 0 and VR 6= 0\nocurrs9 , this interface causes additional scattering for an\nincident electron. In some special case like EF = \u22123,\nthis may make the electrons below EF easier to transport\nthan the electrons above EF , thus a negative S.\nFinally we discuss the disorder effect on the spin Nernst\neffect. Fig.5 shows Ns versus disorder strength W for different Fermi energies. The calculations are averaged over\n500 disorder configurations. Around W < 1.7, Ns shows\nan oscillatory structure. Ns changes sign with increasing of the disorder strength (see EF = \u22123.6 and \u22123.0 in\nFig.5). It is interesting to see that, comparing to a clean\nsystem (W = 0), Ns can be unexpectedly increased by\ndisorder W . This is because the disorder changes the oscillating structure of Ns (see Fig.5b). As expected, the\ndisorder decreases the strength of oscillating, however, it\nalso shifts the peak positions of Ns . It is possible to have\na peak in Ns at finite disorder while it is almost zero\ninitially at clean limit. In Fig.5a, around W = 1 \u223c 1.5,\nfor the Fermi level EF = \u22123.8, \u22122.2, we can see that Ns\nis up to about three times of Ns at W = 0. The behavior of Ns v.s. W is very apparent when the Fermi level\nEF is close to the bottom of energy band (EF = \u22124).\nFor EF = \u22123.8, Ns is much bigger than those at other\nFermi levels, and we can see a very remarkable peak at\nabout W = 1.4. For EF = \u22122.2, Ns begins from \u22120.005,\nchanges its sign at about W \u223c 1.25 and than increases,\nagain reaches to 0.005 at about W \u223c 1.75. With a very\nbig disorder, Ns should go to zero as system enters into\nan insulating regime. We find that the zero of Ns occurs\nat W = 3 for VR = 0.05. This is roughly independent of\nthe locations of the Fermi energy.\nIn summary, in the absence of a perpendicular magnetic field, the interplay between the spin Nernst effect and the seebeck effect is investigated in a twodimensional cross-bar with a spin-orbit interaction. The\nspin Nernst effect exhibits an oscillatory structure for a\nwide range of the Rashba SOI. With a large Rashba SOI,\nthe Ns oscillation has a peak when the seebeck coefficient possesses one. However, the inverse condition is\nnot always satisfied, namely, the seebeck coefficient can\nbe almost zero while Ns has a peak. The disorder effect on the spin Nernst effects is also studied. We find\nthat disorder can enhance Ns up to three times for some\n\n\f5\nFermi levels. In addition, the disorder can also change\nthe sign of spin Nernst effect. Moreover, the limit of disorder where Ns goes to zero is independent of the Fermi\nenergy.\n\n*\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nElectronic address: xuele@okstate.edu\nA.S. Dzurak, et al., Phys.
