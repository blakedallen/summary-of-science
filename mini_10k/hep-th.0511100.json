More precisely, the claim is that the isomorphism classes of Dbrane boundary states modulo boundary renormalization group (RG) flow are in one to\none correspondence [3] with suitable K-theory classes of the string theory background in\nquestion. For geometrical backgrounds such as Calabi-Yau manifolds one can construct a\nvariety of D-branes by applying methods from boundary CFT, matrix factorizations and\ngeometry [4\u201311]. However, determining the endpoint of the RG flow [12] is unfortunately\nnot easy.\n\n1\n\n\fMost well-understood in this context are purely geometrical backgrounds of string\ntheory, such as tori, orbifolds, and Calabi-Yau manifolds. In these instances, the Ktheories were either already available in the mathematics literature or are easily computed by standard techniques and the complementary string theory computation of\nD-brane charges is relatively straightforward.\nLess trivial is the situation of string theory backgrounds with non-trivial NSNS\nthree-form flux H, where it is believed that twisted K-theory is the correct structure\nto classify D-brane charges [2, 13, 14]. Explicit checks of this claim have so far been\nrestricted to backgrounds with large symmetries, namely supersymmetric WZW and\ncoset conformal field theories (CFT)s [15\u201326]. The computation of twisted K-theories\nfor compact Lie groups and coset models thereof were greatly simplified by the theorem\nof Freed, Hopkins, and Teleman [27\u201329].\nThe objective of this paper is to test the twisted K-theory proposal beyond standard\nCFT backgrounds by extending it to Gepner models. These are essentially orbifolds\nof tensor products of N = 2 minimal models, realized for our purposes in terms of\nSU(2)/U(1) supersymmetric coset models. They are known to describe certain tori and\nCalabi-Yau spaces at particular points in their moduli space. Because the K-groups are\na topological quantity, the D-brane charge group should be independent of the moduli.\nTherefore the twisted equivariant K-theory of the Gepner models has to agree with\nthe topological K-theory of the corresponding Calabi-Yau manifold. This provides a\nnon-trivial check of the brane charge classification.\nTechnically, we are going to make use of the twisted equivariant Chern character.\nConsequently, we are going to compute the complexified K-groups\nK \u2217 (X; C) def\n= K \u2217 (X) \u2297Z C\n\n(1)\n\nonly. The downside is that one looses interesting torsion [30\u201332] information, since\nK \u2217 (X) = Zr \u2295 Zn1 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Znk\n\n\u21d2\n\nK \u2217 (X; C) = Cr .\n\n(2)\n\nHowever, the since none of the Calabi-Yau threefolds with Gepner points actually have\ntorsion in their K-group we do not expect to find any in the Gepner models either.\nDuring the final stage of this work we received a preprint [11] that constructs a basis\nof D-branes for the D-brane charge group. We will discuss a few details of their approach\nin Section 6.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe Quintic\n\nAs an hors d'oeuvre to our work, let us discuss [4, 33] the (k = 3)5 Gepner model. It is\nknow to correspond to the Fermat quintic\n4\nn\no\nX\nQ = [x0 : x1 : x2 : x3 : x4 ]\nx5i = 0 \u2282 P4 .\n(3)\ni=0\n\nThe Hodge diamond of the quintic is by now quite familiar to all string theorists, and\nreads\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\npq\nh (Q) = 1 101 101 1 .\n(4)\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\nWe also know what there is no torsion in its cohomology, which then determines its\nK-theory to be\nK 0 (Q) = H even (Q; C) = Z4\n\n\u21d2 K 0 (Q; C) = C4 ,\n\nK 1 (Q) = H odd (Q; Z) = Z204\n\n\u21d2 K 1 (Q; C) = C204 .\n\n(5)\n\nWe are going to arrive at the same answer for the complexified K-groups directly from\nthe Gepner model, without making any reference to the quintic hypersurface.\nThe Gepner model corresponding to the quintic is a Z5 orbifold of 5 copies of the\nlevel k = 3 minimal model, see Sections 3.2 and 3.6 for more details. Moreover, the\nminimal model can be realized as an su(2)k /u(1) coset CFT. The coset CFT has a nice\nsigma model interpretation, it is an SU(2) WZW model with a gauged U(1) action.\nMore precisely, the U(1) acts1 as\nU(1) \u00d7 SU(2) \u2192 SU(2) ,\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\nh\ncos \u03b82 sin \u03b82\na b\ncos \u03b82 sin \u03b82\na b i\ni\u03b8\n(6)\n7\n\u2192\ne ,\nc d\nc d\n\u2212 sin 2\u03b8 cos \u03b82\n\u2212 sin 2\u03b8 cos \u03b82\n\nSee also Figure 1 for a picture of the orbits.

Since\nall maximal tori are conjugate, we just picked this one for explicitness.\n2\nFor any space X with action of a group G, we write X G for the G-fixed points.

The fixed\npoint sets SA1 and SB1 form a Hopf link inside SU(2) \u2243 S 3 .\nBy now it is firmly established that the charge group is given by the K-theory of\nspace-time. More precisely, one has to pick the right \"flavor\" of K-theory depending on\nwhich N = 1 supersymmetric theory one formulates on the background [19, 22, 26, 34].\nFor the coset model, the background is SU(2) with an H flux. The latter implies that\nthe correct K-theory is the so-called twisted K-theory, which we denote by tK. Moreover,\nwe want to gauge a U(1) symmetry. As is familiar to all string theorists, this does not\n4\n\n\fmean that we work on the set theoretic quotient SU(2)/U(1). Instead, we have to\ncorrectly incorporate the twisted sectors, which on the level of cohomology means that\nwe have to compute the U(1) equivariant cohomology groups. Therefore, the correct\nK-theory for the minimal model is\n\u0010\n\u0011\nD-brane charges in su(2)k /u(1) coset = tK U (1) SU(2)\n(8)\n\nwith the twist class\n\nt=k+2 \u2208 Z=\n\nHU3 (1)\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nSU(2); Z .\n\nHence the D-brane charges in the tensor product of 5 minimal models are\n\u0010\n\u0011\nt\nK U (1)\u00d7U (1)\u00d7U (1)\u00d7U (1)\u00d7U (1) SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) ,\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere each U(1) acts on just one of the SU(2) factors. Finally, the Gepner model is the\nZ5 orbifold by the diagonal Z5 action.

In other words,\nm \u2208 Z5 = {0, . . . , 4} acts by multiplication with \u03c9 m = exp( 2\u03c0im\n5 ).\n5\nPerhaps not surprisingly, formally the same computation arises when one tries [35] to construct\nGepner models using matrix factorizations. However, the authors of [35] fail to address the twisted\nsector branes that arise when the Gepner model contains minimal models of different levels.\n\n6\n\n\f3\n\nK-Theory of Gepner Models\n\n3.1\n\nGroup Theory\n\nAs we saw in the quintic example discussed in Section 2, one has to determine cohomology groups which form representations under a discrete group GGSO (=Z5 for the\nquintic) which implements the GSO6 projection. Now we could always work with polynomials of characters as in eq. (19), but this becomes cumbersome if one has to deal\nwith tensor products of different minimal models.\nFor cyclic groups Z\u03ba , the following representations7 will appear again and again.\n\u2022 The trivial representation C.\n\u2022 The regular representation RZ\u03ba , which is defined as follows: Take the vector\nspace C\u03ba . The group acts by cyclically permuting the \u03ba basis vectors. The regular\nrepresentation can be diagonalized to the sum of all 1-dimensional representations.\nExplicitly, if \u03c7 : Z\u03ba \u2192 C, \u03c7(1) = exp( 2\u03c0i\n) is the generating character then\n\u03ba\nRZ\u03ba =\n\n\u03ba\u22121\nM\n\n\u03c7i .\n\n(20)\n\ni=0\n\nf \u03ba , which is the regular representation without its trivial\n\u2022 The representation RZ\nsub-representation\n\u03ba\u22121\nM\nf\n\u03c7i .\n(21)\nRZ\u03ba =\ni=1\n\nMore formally, it is the cokernel\n\nf \u03ba \u2212\u2192 0\n0 \u2212\u2192 C \u2212\u2192 RZ\u03ba \u2212\u2192 RZ\n\n(22)\n\nMoreover, since we are actually computing cohomology groups everything has a cohomological Z2 -grade. By definition, we assign\n\u0001\ndeg C = 0 ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nf\u03ba = 1.\ndeg RZ\u03ba = deg RZ\n\n(23a)\n(23b)\n\nOf course, we have the usual operations of restriction and induction (transfer) to\nrelate GGSO -representations and representations of subgroups of GGSO . However, GGSO\nis always a cyclic group and we have yet another operation which will occur frequently.\n6\n7\n\nAfter Gliozzi, Scherk, and Olive [36].\nIn this paper, we are only going to consider complex representations.\n\n7\n\n\fThis works as follows. Given any subgroup Z\u03ba \u2282 GGSO , we have in addition to the\ninclusion i also a projection \u03c0\ni: n7\u2192\n\n|GGSO |\nn\n\u03ba\n\n))\n\nZ\u03ba ii\n\nGGSO \u2243 Z|GGSO |\n\n(24)\n\n\u03c0: n7\u2192n mod \u03ba\n\nby modding out by \u03ba. Given a representation \u03c1 : Z\u03ba \u2192 Cn , we can then define a\nGSO\n(\u03c1) of GGSO on the same vector space Cn by composing\nrepresentation pG\nZ\u03ba\n\u0001\nGSO\n(\u03c1) def\npG\n= \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c0 : GGSO \u2192 Cn , (n, v) 7\u2192 \u03c1 n mod \u03ba, v .\nZ\u03ba\n\n(25)\n\nNow in general the projection \u03c0 depends on which generators you chose for GGSO , a\nrandom choice. However, for the identity, the regular, and the reduced regular representation of Z\u03ba the resulting GGSO representation does not depend on that choice. We\nGSO\noperation in these cases.\nare only going to use the pG\nZ\u03ba\n2\u03c0i\nFor example, consider the group Z12 = {0, 1, . . . , 11} with the character \u03c7(1) = e 12 .\nThen the representation\npZZ12\n3\n\n\u0010\n\nf3\nRZ\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\nf\nRZ4 =\n\u0011\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0010\n= \u03c74 + \u03c78 \u03c73 + \u03c76 + \u03c79 = \u03c7 + \u03c72 + \u03c75 + \u03c77 + \u03c710 + \u03c711 (26)\n\n\u2297C pZZ12\n4\n\nis the 6-dimensional representation of Z12 of cohomology degree 2 \u2261 0 mod 2 generated\nby\n\u0010 2\u03c0i 4\u03c0i 10\u03c0i 14\u03c0i 20\u03c0i 22\u03c0i \u0011\n(27)\ndiag e 12 , e 12 , e 12 , e 12 , e 12 , e 12 .\n\nIn the future, we are just going to write \u2297, and it will be understood that we are\ntensoring over C.\n\n3.2\n\nMinimal Model as Coset\n\nThe minimal models for the N = 2 superconformal algebra have equivalent realizations\nin terms of super-GKO coset models\nsu(2)k \u2295 u(1)2\n,\nu(1)k+2\n\n(28)\n\nas well as Landau-Ginzburg models. The modular invariant partition functions fall into\nan ADE classification [37\u201339]. From the coset CFT point of view these are obtained\nfrom the ADE modular invariants of the su(2)k WZW model. We shall focus on the A\nseries minimal models. There are various subtleties concerning which modular invariant\ncorresponds to the A-type superpotential and it will turn out that there are essentially\n8\n\n\ffour distinct models that will to of interest. The fields of the coset CFT are labeled by\n(j, n, s), where j = 0, * * * , k/2 is the su(2)k highest weight, n \u2208 Z2(k+2) labels the representations of the denominator u(1)k+2 and s \u2208 Z4 labels the free fermion representations\nin u(1)2. There is a Zk+2 \u00d7 Z2 discrete group acting on the fields in the following fashion\n2n\n\n\u03b1 : \u03a6(j,n,s) 7\u2192 (\u22121) k+2 \u03a6(j,n,s) ,\n\u03b2 : \u03a6(j,n,s) 7\u2192 (\u22121)s \u03a6(j,n,s) .\n\n(29)\n\nThe Zk+2 action is realized geometrically in the gauged WZW model by the rotation of\nthe disc target space. Orbifolding the A-type theory with respect to these symmetries\nyields new modular invariants, as was first observed in [15]. Note that a related issue\narose in the context of WZW models for non-simply laced groups in [22], where nontrivial automorphisms acting on the fermions gave rise to new modular invariants for\nthe supersymmetric WZW models.\nSince s = 1, 3 corresponds to the Ramond sector, the orbifold by Z2 = h\u03b2i is from\na space-time point of view the same as modding out (\u22121)F . The state space of the\n(charge conjugate) diagonal modular invariant is\nM\nHM Mk =\nH(j,n,s) \u2297 H(j,n,s) ,\n(30)\n(j,n,s)\n\nwhere the direct sum is over the standard range of super-parafermion representations\nincluding the selection and identification rules\n(j, n, s) \u2261 (k/2 \u2212 j, n + k + 2, s + 2) ,\n\n2j + n + s \u2208 2Z .\n\nThe state space of the Z2 orbifold is then obtained as\nM\nH(j,n,s) \u2297 H(j,n,\u2212s) .\nHM Mk /Z2 =\n\n(31)\n\n(32)\n\n(j,n,s)\n\nOrbifolding MMk by Zk+2 \u00d7 Z2 it was observed in [15] that the partition function is the\nsame as in MMk , and that this model is in fact T-dual to MMk . Likewise, MMk /Zk+2\nis T-dual to MMk /Z2 .\nGepner models are orbifolds of tensor products of minimal models with not necessarily equal level, which give rise to consistent, GSO-projected string theory backgrounds.\nConsider a tensor product of r minimal models, of level (k1 , * * * kr ), and define\n\u03bb = (j1 , * * * , jr ) ,\n\n\u03bc = (n1 , * * * , nr ; s1 * * * , sr ) ,\n\n(33)\n\nand \u03b2j = (0, * * * , 0, 2, 0 * * * , 0), with the non-zero entry at slot sj and \u03b20 = (1 * * * 1).\nFurther define K = lcm(2, kj + 2). Then the partition function for the Gepner model is\ngiven by\nX 2K\u22121\nX X\nZ(k1 ,*** ,kr ) =\n\u03b4\u03b2 (\u22121)b0 \u03c7\u03bb,\u03bc \u03c7\u0304\u03bb,\u03bc+b0 \u03b20 +P bj \u03b2j .\n(34)\n\u03bb,\u03bc b0 =0 bj =0,1\n\n9\n\n\fThe characters of the tensor product of the minimal models are denoted by \u03c7. In\nprinciple, one can define the conserved D-brane charges using RG flow [40, 41], but in\npractice this is not feasible.\n\n3.3\n\nChern Character of the Minimal Model\n\nNow that we have defined all the ingredients, we can start to compute the relevant Kgroups. Our main tool is going to be the twisted equivariant Chern character [28, 42].\nFor explicitness, let us consider a single minimal model whose complexified D-brane\ncharge group is\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\nK U (1) SU(2) \u2297Z C def\nK\nSU(2);\nC\n,\n(35)\n=\nU (1)\n\nwhere \u03ba = k + 2 is going to be the twist class8 for the remainder of this section. Now,\ngiven a twisted equivariant vector bundle we can tensor it with any group representation,\nand get another equivariant vector bundle with the same twist. In other words, there is\n\u0001\nan action of KU (1) {pt.}; C = RU(1) = C[z, z \u22121 ] on the twisted equivariant K-theory.\nIn geometrical terms, C[z, z \u22121 ] is the ring of functions on C\u00d7 def\n= C \\ {0}. And the\n\u0001\n\u03ba\ntwisted equivariant K-theory K U (1) SU(2); C is a module over this function algebra,\nthat is a sheaf over the base space C\u00d7 . The twisted equivariant Chern character identifies\nthe stalks (fibers) of this sheaf over a point in C\u00d7 with a certain cohomology group. More\nprecisely, Freed-Hopkins-Teleman [28] identify the stalk over \u03b6 \u2208 C\u00d7 with\n\u0010\n\u0011\nK \u2217U (1) SU(2); C\n\n\u03ba\n\n\u03b6\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2243 \u03baH \u2217U (1) SU(2)\u03b6 ; \u03baL(\u03b6) ,\n\n(36)\n\nwhere \u03baL(\u03b6) is a certain flat line bundle. Note that when we say that \u03b6 acts on SU(2),\n\u03b6\nwe really mean that |\u03b6|\n\u2208 U(1) acts on SU(2).\nIn general the knowledge of the stalks is not enough to reconstruct the sheaf, for\nexample every fiber of a line bundle is just isomorphic to C. However, in the case of a\nsingle minimal model the sheaf turns out to be a skyscraper sheaf, and can indeed be\nreconstructed.\n\n3.4\n\nTwisted Equivariant Cohomology of the Minimal Model\n\nIn this section, we are going to determine the twisted equivariant cohomology groups\nthat appear in the Chern character formula eq. (36). We advise the reader who is not\ninterested in all the details to note the result, eqns. (45a) and (45b), and then proceed\nwith the next section.\n\u0001\nIn fact, the problem is very similar to \u03baK SU (2) SU(2); C which is explicitly worked\nout as an example in [28]. Depending on \u03b6, there are two different fixed point sets.\n8\n\n\u0001\n3\nSU (2); Z .\nThat is, the twist class is \u03ba times the generator of HU(1)\n\n10\n\n\fOne possibility is \u03b6 \u2208 R>0 , which acts trivially on the whole SU(2). It turns out [28]\nthat the line bundle \u03baL(\u03b6) is trivial in that case. Therefore, the untwisted equivariant\ncohomology is\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u000e\nHU\u2217 (1) SU(2)\u03b6 ; \u03baL(\u03b6) = HU\u2217 (1) SU(2); C = C[u, t] u2 ,\n(37)\nwhere we used the Leray spectral sequence\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0011\n\u21d2 HUp+q\nH p BU(1); H q SU(2); C\n(1) SU(2); C\n\n(38)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nwith t \u2208 H 2 BU(1); C of degree 2 and u \u2208 H 3 SU(2); C of degree 3. To determine\n\u0001\nthe twisted equivariant cohomology \u03baH \u2217U (1) SU(2); C from the untwisted one, we have\nto mod out9 by the additional differential10 d3 = \u03bau. An easy computation shows that\n\u0001\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nker d3\n\u03b6 \u03ba\n\u03ba \u2217\n\u03ba \u2217\n\u0001 = 0.\nH U (1) SU(2) ; L(\u03b6) = H U (1) SU(2); C =\n(39)\nimg d3\nThis settles the case where the whole SU(2) is fixed under the \u03b6 action. The other\npossibility is the generic case where SU(2)\u03b6 = SA1 . In that case, the flat line bundle\n\u03ba\nL(\u03b6) over SA1 has [28] holonomy \u03b6 \u03ba , so all cohomology groups vanish unless \u03b6 \u03ba = 1. In\nthat case, that is over the \u03ba \u2212 1 points\n\u03b6m def\n=e\n\n2\u03c0im\n\u03ba\n\n,\n\nm = 1, . . . , \u03ba \u2212 1\n\n(40)\n\nthe untwisted cohomology is\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nHU\u2217 (1) SA1 ; \u03baL(\u03b6m ) = H \u2217 BU(1); C \u2297 H \u2217 SA1 ; \u03baL(\u03b6m ) =\n\n\u000e\n\u000e\n= C[t] \u2297 C[v] v 2 = C[v, t] v 2 , (41)\n\n\u0001\nwhere deg(v) = 1 and deg(t) = 2. The twist class is in HU3 (1) SA1 ; \u03baL(\u03b6m ) = C * tv.\nHence, if one normalizes tv properly then d3 = \u03batv. The d3 -cohomology is\n(\n\u0001\n\u0010\n\u0011\nker\nd\nC, \u2217 = 1;\n3\n\u03ba \u2217\n\u0001 = Cv =\nH U (1) SA1 ; \u03baL(\u03b6m ) =\n(42)\nimg d3\n0 , else.\n\nIn addition to the U(1) action on SU(2), we can also act with Z\u03ba . We find two more\ncases, the fixed point set can be either SB1 or empty. The cohomology of the empty set\nof course vanishes. In the former case, note that U(1) acts simply transitive on SB1 , so\nthe equivariant cohomology is just the cohomology of a point.

For that, it is important to work with complex coefficients, because it\nwould generate torsion contributions over the integers. Also note that the Z\u03ba equivariant\nK-theory is in general not the same as the Z\u03ba invariant K-groups.\nTo summarize, we observe that the Z\u03ba orbifold indeed exchanges K 0 \u2194 K 1 , as we\nexpect from the mirror involution. Furthermore, recall the distinction between A- and\nB-type branes [15]. The A-branes carry the charges in eq. (45a), contributing to K 1 of\nthe minimal model. On the other hand side, the B-branes eq. (45b) are only stable in\nthe Z\u03ba orbifold of the minimal model where they contribute to K 0 .\n\n3.6\n\nK-Groups for Gepner Models\n\nHaving tackled a single minimal model, we now proceed to Gepner models [4, 37\u201339]. For\nthat we take d copies of the SU(2) with the action of d copies of U(1) factor-by-factor.\nThat is\nU(1)d \u00d7 SU(2)d \u2192 SU(2)d\n(48)\nwith a choice of twist\n\u03ba = (\u03ba1 , \u03ba2 , . . . , \u03bad ) ,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere ki = \u03bai \u2212 2 is the level in the CFT of the i-th factor. The overall central charge\nis\nd\nd\nX\nX\n3(\u03bai \u2212 2)\n3ki\n=\n.\n(50)\nc=\nk\n+\n2\n\u03ba\ni\ni\ni=1\ni=1\n13\n\n\fWhenever 3c is integer, this could be the central charge of a geometric compactification of that dimension. However, a mere tensor product of minimal models is never\ngeometric because of non-integer charges. In other words, it does not have space-times\nsupersymmetry. The solution to this problem [37] is to orbifold by a certain discrete\nsymmetry group GGSO .\nAs we have seen, each of the minimal models has a discrete symmetry group Z\u03bai =\n{0, 1, . . . , \u03bai \u2212 1}. The GSO projection is the group generated by\n\u0001\n\n1, 1, . . . , 1 \u2208\n\nd\nY\n\nZ\u03bai .\n\n(51)\n\nGGSO = Zlcm(\u03ba1 ,\u03ba2,...,\u03bad ) .\n\n(52)\n\ni=1\n\nIt follows that\nAccording to the general dictionary between D-brane charge groups and K-theory group,\nthe D-brane charges in the Gepner model are\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03ba\n(53)\nK U (1)d \u00d7GGSO SU(2)d .\n\nWe can again compute (the complexification) through the twisted equivariant Chern\ncharacter. Once we translate the K-groups into cohomology, we can use that\n\u2022 the GGSO equivariant cohomology is the GGSO invariant cohomology and\n\u2022 the K\u00fcnneth theorem for cohomology,\n\nneither of which hold in general for twisted equivariant K-theory. Again, we have to\ncomplexify\n\u0001d\nU(1)d \u00d7 GGSO\nC\u00d7 \u00d7 GGSO\n(54)\n\nand think of the cohomology and K-groups as sheaves over this space.

Two of them, k =\n(1, 1, 1) and k = (0, 1, 4), turn out to be the same CFT (for example, have identical\npartition functions). Hence, we obtain two different CFTs corresponding to the two\norbifold singularities in the complex structure moduli space of the torus, see Table 1.\nRecall that each elliptic curve C/(Z \u2295 \u03c4 Z) has a Z2 symmetry, but at \u03c4 = i and \u03c4 =\n) the symmetry is enhanced to Z4 and Z6 , respectively. We easily compute using\nexp( 2\u03c0i\n3\neq.

It is important to realize [44] that adding one factor with c = 0 in the\nGepner model does indeed have a physical effect.

Note that the usual\nargument why k = 0 factors do not matter is wrong: In the corresponding LandauGinzburg model [45], the k = 0 factor corresponds to a field \u03a6 which appears in the\nsuperpotential as\nWLG = * * * + \u03a62 .\n(62)\nThen it is claimed that one can integrate out \u03a6 at no cost. But that is only true if one\nrestricts to the closed strings, if one considers D-branes and open strings then one must\ninclude a boundary action which will contain \u03a6 as well.\n\n4.2\n\nTwisted Sectors\n\nLet us have a closer look at the formula for the K-groups of a Gepner model, eq.

Note that a single tensor factor pG\nRZ\u03bai does not have\nZ\u03bai\nany GGSO -invariant subspace, so the only way to obtain something invariant is to either\nhave zero factors (which yields a B-type brane), or \u2265 2 factors.

It is\nclear from Section 3.5 that all D-brane charges can be found as suitable combinations\nof the D-branes in the coset or its mirror (Z\u03ba orbifold). In particular, the usual tensor\nproduct and permutation branes give all the D-brane charges in the untwisted sector,\ncorresponding to g = 0 in eq. (59). Similarly, one obtains zero or one brane in the\ntwisted (g = 1, . . . , |GGSO |) sectors. But the latter is not enough to fill out the D-brane\ncharge lattice in general, since sometimes there are two or more independent charges\ncoming from a twisted sector. Of course, all that means is that the boundary state\nconstruction is incomplete. Using Landau-Ginzburg models and matrix factorizations\none obtains [11, 50] all brane charges.\nInspection of the formula for the K-groups eq. (59) shows that 2 or more brane\ncharges can only come from a g \u2208 GGSO sector where some \u03bai divides g. Moreover, if\nonly a single \u03bai divides g, then there is no contribution because\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011iGGSO\nGGSO f\npZ\u03ba\nRZ\u03bai\n=0\ni\n\n(79)\n\nhas no invariant subspace. Hence, the interesting case is if two or more \u03bai have a common\nfactor. Following [11] let us consider the case where r of the shifted levels \u03ba = (\u03ba1 , . . . )\nhave the same11 divisor d > 2.\nFirst, note that r odd contributes to K 1 only, as is evident from our degree convention\neqns. (23a), (23b). Not so surprisingly, if one [11] restricts oneself to K 0 then there are\nno D-brane charges for r = 1, 3, 5. This leaves the cases r = 2 and r = 4. Looking\nat the list of Gepner models, r = 4 can only occur if the Gepner model has more than\n5 minimal model factors. There is nothing wrong with that, and our formula eq. (59)\ngives the correct answer for the K-groups. However, if one [11] were to restrict oneself\nto 5 minimal model factors, then r = 4 cannot occur either.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nThere is a very simple formula eq. (59) for the rank of the K-groups of Gepner models.\nThe summands in the formula have a natural interpretation as the contributions from\ntwisted sectors. We checked the computation in c = 3, 6, 9 Gepner models and find\nagreement with the topology of the associated Calabi-Yau manifolds.\n11\n\nIf the common divisor d = 2, then there is again only a one-dimensional contribution to the K-group\nin the g \u2208 dZ twisted sectors, which is not so interesting. Of course, our arguments hold in that case\nas well.\n\n19\n\n\fA\n\nK3 Gepner Models\n\nThere are 16 Gepner models which are associated to K3 surfaces [51\u201353] listed in Table 2.\nWe checked that we obtain\nk\nk\nk\nk\n\n= (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),\n= (1, 1, 4, 4),\n= (0, 2, 6, 6),\n= (0, 1, 8, 13),\n\nk\nk\nk\nk\n\n= (0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4),\n= (1, 1, 2, 10),\n= (0, 2, 4, 10),\n= (0, 1, 7, 16),\n\nk\nk\nk\nk\n\n= (2, 2, 2, 2),\n= (0, 4, 4, 4),\n= (0, 2, 3, 18),\n= (0, 1, 6, 22),\n\nk\nk\nk\nk\n\n= (1, 2, 2, 4),\n= (0, 3, 3, 8),\n= (0, 1, 10, 10),\n= (0, 1, 5, 40)\n\nTable 2: Gepner models associated to K3.\n\n\u2217\nK U (1)d \u00d7GGSO\n\n\u03ba\n\n\u0010\n\nd\n\n\u0011\n\nSU(2) ; C =\n\n\u001a\n\nC24 , \u2217 = 0\n0, \u2217 = 1\n\n\u001b\n\n\u0001\n= K \u2217 K3; C .\n\n(80)\n\nin all 16 cases. It is important that the right number of k = 0 factors appears so that\nthere are 4 minimal models altogether (exceptionally, 6 in the first two Gepner models).\nIn addition to the 16 known K3 Gepner models we found that\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n(2,3,3,3,3,3,3) \u2217\nK U (1)7 \u00d7GGSO SU(2)7 ; C = K \u2217 K3; C ,\n(81)\n\nas well. Although it has not the conventional number of factors, this k = (0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)\nGepner model seems to yield yet another K3 CFT.\nThere is yet another combination of levels such that the total central charge c = 6,\nwhich is k = (0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2). One can easily compute that\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u001a C8 , \u2217 = 0 \u001b\n\u0001\n(2,3,3,3,4,4) \u2217\n6\n= K \u2217 T 4; C .\n(82)\nK U (1)6 \u00d7GGSO SU(2) ; C =\n8\nC , \u2217=1\nClearly, this Gepner model describes a T 4 compactification with (accidentally) enhanced\nN = 8 space-time supersymmetry.\n\nB\n\nCalabi-Yau Threefold Gepner Models\n\nFirst, note that a proper Calabi-Yau threefold X, that is a compact K\u00e4hler manifold of\nholonomy SU(3) satisfies\nrank K 0 (X) = 2h11 (X) + 2 ,\n\nrank K 1 (X) = 2h21 (X) + 2 .\n\n(83)\n\nWe can check this formula against the known list [54, 55] of 168 Gepner models with\ncentral charge c = 9, which are associated to Calabi-Yau threefolds. The list of all\nGepner models is reproduced in Table 3.

of the E8 \u00d7E8 heterotic string, then their low-energy spectrum consists\nof a number n27 = h11 (X) of matter fields transforming in the 27 and n27 = h21 (X) of\nfield in the 27 representation of E6 .\nOne can check that the formula eq. (83) is obeyed for each Gepner model except\nfor the 7 cases with n27 = n27 = 21. The obvious explanation is that this misfit is\nassociated K3 \u00d7 T 2 , which has Hodge numbers\n1\n1\npq\n\n1\n\n2\n\nh (K3 \u00d7 T ) = 1\n\n1\n21\n\n21\n1\n\n1\n1 .\n\n21\n21\n\n1\n\n(84)\n\n1\n1\n\n1\nSince K3 \u00d7T 2 has only SU(2) holonomy, that is, it is not a proper Calabi-Yau manifold,\nit does not have to obey eq. (83). Adding up the even and odd cohomology groups, we\nfind that\n\u0001\n\u0001\nK 0 K3 \u00d7 T 2 = Z48 ,\nK 1 K3 \u00d7 T 2 = Z48 .\n(85)\nThese topological K-groups are in precise agreement with what we computed using the\ncoset eq. (59).\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis research was supported in part by the Department of Physics and the Math/Physics\nResearch Group at the University of Pennsylvania under cooperative research agreement\nDE-FG02-95ER40893 with the U.
