Hellweg et al.\nV. Lisy\nDepartment of Biophysics, P.J. Safarik University, Jesenna 5, 041 54 Kosice,\nSlovakia\n____________________________________________________________________\nIt is shown that the interpretation of quasielastic scattering experiments on droplet\nmicroemulsions in the paper by T. Hellweg et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2000, 2,\n5168, contains serious shortcomings and should be revised.\n____________________________________________________________________\nIn the recent paper1 the direct determination of the elasticity coefficients \u03ba and \u03ba of\nthe surfactant film for an oil-continuous droplet microemulsion has been presented.\nThese constants have been attempted using three experimental techniques. The smallangle neutron scattering (SANS) was used to get the polydispersity of the droplets in\nradii, p2, and the mean droplet radius in the sample, Rm. The dynamic light scattering\n(DLS) measurements were used to obtain the self-diffusion coefficient of the\ndroplets, D0, and also the polydispersity. From the neutron spin-echo experiment\n(NSE) the relaxation time \u03c42 of the lowest mode of the droplet fluctuations in the\nshape has been accessed. By a combined analysis of the found quantities both \u03ba and\n\u03ba have been determined. From the methodical point of view this work represents a\nperspective way of using alternative techniques to gain information about the\nparameters of the surfactant film. However, the realization of this program contains\nshortcomings that make the interpretation of the experiments incorrect so that the\nextracted values of \u03ba and \u03ba are not reliable. To prove this statement we begin with\nthe intermediate scattering function (eqn.(16) in Ref.1) I(q,t) that describes the\nquasielastic scattering of neutrons on a spherical droplet fluctuating in the shape.\nEquation (16) corresponds to the perfect shell contrast (when the scattering length\ndensities \u03c11 and \u03c12 of the bulk fluids are equal) and to the lowest nonvanishing\napproximation in the small thickness of the surface layer d. I(q,t) consists of two\nparts. The time-independent part is determined by the function\nf 0 (x ) = j 02 (x ) + j 0 (x )(\n[ 4 \u2212 x ) j0 (x ) \u2212 2 j1 (x )]\u2211 (2l + 1) ul20 4\u03c0 , x = qR ,\nl >1\n\nwhere ul0 are fluctuation amplitudes of the radius.1 The first term here describes the\nstatic scattering from a nonfluctuating spherical shell of the radius R. The second\nterm accounts for the shape fluctuations. This contribution should be calculated up to\nthe second order in the small quantities ul0. This has been done in our paper2 for\narbitrary scattering length densities and d. The correct result for f0(x) in the limit d\u21920\n\n\fand for \u03c11=\u03c12 differs from the above given expression by the factor before the sum\nwhich should be -j02(x)(2+x2). In Ref.2 all the second-order contributions from the\nfluctuations have been summed in I(q,t). This means that I(q,t) contains also a term\n\u223c u 00 arising due to the conservation of the droplet volume (assumed also in Ref.1).\nIn Ref.3 our calculations have been confirmed except that the contribution due to the\nvolume constraint was missed. Even in this case the result for I(q,t) differs from that\nin Ref.1 since, in the mentioned limit, the factor before the sum in f0 is now -j0(x)\n\u00d7[2xj1(x)+(x2-2)j0(x)].3 Notice that if the droplet volume is conserved, the terms\n\u223c u 00 cannot be neglected when any physical quantity is calculated to the second\norder in the fluctuation amplitudes. The authors1 state (without any evidence) that the\npolydispersity is erroneously counted twice in our approach2. To make clear with this\nquestion we only remark that u 00 is not the polydispersity that is often treated as\n2\n.1 It simply follows from the condition for the droplet volume, V = 4\u03c0R 3 3 ,\nu 00\n\nhence u 00 = \u2212(4\u03c0)\n\n\u2211\n3)[1 + (3 4\u03c0 )\u2211\n\u22121 / 2\n\n(\n\nV = 4\u03c0R 3\n\n2\n\nl >1,m\n\nu lm .4 Omitting the \u223c u 00 term the volume would be\n\nl >1,m\n\nu lm\n\n2\n\n] . One can assume a different meaning of the\n\nradius R (not the equivalent-volume radius); then R will implicitly depend on the\nfluctuation amplitudes that should be reflected in eqns.(16)-(18).1 In our approach the\npolydispersity appears only after the averaging over the distribution of the droplets in\nradii that follows from the microemulsion thermodynamics. For example, the\naveraged droplet volume is V R \u2248 (4\u03c0 3)Rm3 1 + 3 p 2 . The use of a different\n\n(\n\n)\n\n1\n\ndistribution, like the Schulz one , makes the calculations inconsistent with the theory\nof the droplet formation.\nNote that expressing I(q,t)/I(q,0)= exp \u2212 D0 q 2 t [a + (1 \u2212 a )exp(\u2212 t / \u03c4 2 )] and adjusting\n\n(\n\n)\n\nthe parameters a and \u03c42 to the NSE data, a quantitative disagreement with eqn.(16)\nhas been observed already in the paper5 by one of the authors.1 The coefficient D0\nwas determined from DLS and from \u03c42 the sum 4\u03ba- \u03ba was computed according to\neqn.(19).1 However, the used expression for \u03c42 is not correct: it is not applicable to\nincompressible shells assumed in1, as it was already pointed out in Refs.6,7 (see\nalso8). Moreover, the account for the higher (l>2) modes is essential in the\ncalculations of the scattering functions.2 The use of eqn.(20) is thus not justified: it\nbrings an uncontrolled error in the determination of \u03ba and \u03ba . As to the self-diffusion\ncoefficient D0 determined from DLS, it was shown that its correct extraction from the\nexperiments requires a description of the scattering that takes into account different\nrefractive indices of the oil, water, and surfactant.2 This was not done in Ref.1. The\ndescription of the quasielastic experiments is thus flawed. The interpretation of\nSANS is not correct as well. Treating SANS within the model of a diffuse scattering\nlength boundary (note the difference with the model used for the description of NSE),\n\n2\n\n\fthe droplet fluctuations are fully ignored. In the description of SANS within the\nmodel of droplets with sharp boundaries it would mean that the formfactor of the\nstatic scattering, P(q)=I(q,0), is determined simply by f0(x)=j02(x). The influence of\nthe fluctuations is however essential as analyzed in detail previously.2 The measured\nSANS signal is sensitive not only to the layer thickness, the polydispersity, and the\nmean radius; it is also significantly affected by the value of \u03ba. The analysis in Ref.1\nimplicitly assumes \u03ba to be so large that the fluctuations can be neglected. This\ncontradicts to the treatment of the inelastic scattering experiments. It also makes the\ndetermination of the combination 2\u03ba+ \u03ba from p2 (obtained when eqns.(12) and (13)\nwith no fluctuation contributions are fitted to the SANS data)1 doubtful.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that while the method for the determination of\nthe basic microemulsion parameters presented in Ref.1 is perspective, the interpretation of all the experiments carried out in the discussed work is flawed and should\nbe revised in a number of points.\nReferences\n1.
