Recently it has been suggested 1 that this solid phase\nremains metastable at much lower pressures. Based on an extrapolation of the\nequation of state, the spinodal line is predicted to be at negative pressure, about\n-10 bar. Beside testing this prediction, there is another interest to investigate solid\nhelium at pressures below the melting pressure. Vacancies in this quantum solid\nhave been studied for a long time. In particular their energy Ev has been measured\nLaboratoire Kastler Brossel, ENS/CNRS/Universit\u00e9 Paris 6,\n24 rue Lhomond\nParis, F75005, France\nTel.:331 44323421\nFax:331 44323434\nE-mail: fabien.souris@lkb.ens.fr\n\n\f2\n\nat different pressures 2 , and also computed by Quantum Monte Carlo simulations 3 .\nAlthough there is a significant scatter on the measured values of Ev , it is striking\nthat it is a strongly decreasing function of the molar volume Vm . A simple linear\nextrapolation on the data gathered in reference 2 suggests that an increase of Vm by\nonly 5% beyond the melting volume could bring Ev near zero. Although this is a\nlarge increase for a condensed phase, this is not so for solid helium which is a very\ncompressible material. More precisely, the maximum molar volume for stable hcp\nhelium-4 4 is V f = 21 cm3 , the aimed value is Va = 22 cm3 , while the predicted\nvalue of Vm at the spinodal line is Vs = 34.7 cm3 . Hence Va is within a possibly\naccessible range. If so, this would bring interesting new physics for solid helium.\nWith Ev near zero, vacancies could proliferate, reach a sizable population, possibly undergo a Bose-Einstein condensation, thus realizing the Andreev scenario for\nsupersolidity 5 . Or if the vacancy-vacancy interaction is strong enough 3,6 , it could\nprovide another mechanism for destabilizing the solid phase before reaching Vs .\nMany different methods have been used to study metastable condensed phases,\nmostly liquid, under depression 7 . Metastability cannot be easily obtained for a\nsolid because the interfaces between a solid and the container walls are disordered,\nand generally nucleates the liquid phase. Focused sound waves provide a way to\ncircumvent this difficulty. Starting from a pressure P0 above Pf , a sound pulse\nwith an amplitude \u03b4 Pi smaller than P0 \u2212 Pf at the surface of the transducer will\nnot bring the solid below the melting pressure at the transducer surface. On its\npropagation to the focus the sound pressure can be amplified by a large amount,\nnamely \u03a9 R/\u03bbs (\u03a9 , solid angle of the sound beam, R transducer radius, \u03bbs sound\nwavelength). Hence the peak pressure P0 + \u03b4 Pi \u03a9 R/\u03bbs can explore the metastable\ndomain below Pf with negative \u03b4 Pi .\nThis article reports a first attempt to produce metastable hcp solid helium below its melting pressure. A hemispherical transducer was used to produce a converging sound wave. The density variations at focus are monitored by an optical\ninterferometric method. The experimental arrangement is described in section 2.\nBecause the sound velocity is anisotropic, the focusing is not expected to be perfect in hcp helium. A numerical simulation was made to model the remaining\namplification in this case and to determine the relation between the optical signal\nand the density at focus. Numerical predictions are discussed in section 3. Experimental results are reported and discussed in section 4. Possible improvements and\nconclusions are given in section 5.\n2 Experimental arrangement and procedure\nThe experimental cell is a 4 cm stainless steel cube, with five silica windows\n(diam. 2.5 cm), cooled from the top by a pumped helium-4 fridge in the 1.01.4 K temperature range. To achieve single crystal growth, the nucleation and\ngrowth is made at constant temperature and pressure (1.2 K and 25.5 bar). An\nelectro-crystallization device 8 provides a unique seed which falls on the bottom\nof the cell. The crystal is subsequently grown from this seed. The orientation of\nthe c-facet (most often horizontal) is easily monitored visually during the growth\nprocess which takes place below the corresponding roughening transition 1.3 K 9 .\nA hemispherical piezoelectric transducer of 6 mm internal radius (from Channel Industries) is suspended above the middle of the cell with its axis vertical,\n\n\f3\n\nalong the crystal c-axis. Such a transducer has two main resonant modes: the\nthickness mode frequency is \u03bdh f \u2243 1 MHz, the inner and outer surfaces vibrating in opposite directions. The breathing mode corresponds to an oscillation of\nthe transducer radius and has a frequency \u03bdl f \u2243 180kHz. In order to simplify as\nmuch as possible the pressure wave, a single oscillation of the thickness mode\nwas used. The driving voltage is produce by an arbitrary function generator and\namplified by a RF amplifier up to a voltage ranging from 100 V to 800 V on 50 \u03a9 .\nThe pulse shape is designed to leave the transducer at rest at the end of the pulse.\nBeside the one-cycle oscillation at 1 MHz, the exciting pulse also produces a parasitic oscillation of the low frequency breathing mode which appears after the end\nof the 1 MHz pulse. The sound velocity in hcp solid helium is anisotropic. For\nlongitudinal waves, the velocity is about 540 m/s along the c-axis and 460 m/s\nwhen the wave vector is in the basal plane 10 . Hence the initially spherical wave\ndoes not remain so and breaks up into two parts: one along the c-axis, named as 'zpulse' hereafter, and another radial one, named 'r-pulse'. Both show a maximum\namplitude near the center of the transducer. Their relative intensity and shape will\nbe discussed in the next section. In order to have an optical access to the transducer\ncenter two small notches (1 mm wide, 1.5 mm high) were made on the transducer\nrim, along a diameter.\nThe phenomena at the focus are monitored optically. A CW-laser beam (\u03bbo =\n532 nm) propagating along the y-axis is focused at the cell center with a 30 \u03bc m\nwaist. The laser polarization is along the vertical z-axis. The axis origin is taken at\nthe transducer center. Density modulations along the beam path produced by the\nsound wave result in an optical phase change\nZ\np\n2\u03c0 l/2\n\u03b4 \u03c6 (x, z) =\n(1)\ndy \u03b4 n( x2 + y2 , z)\n\u03bbo \u2212l/2\nwhere l is the cell length. The change in refractive index \u03b4 n is related to that\nof density \u03b4 \u03c1 through \u03b4 n/(n \u2212 1) = \u03b4 \u03c1 /\u03c1 . This linear approximation of the\nClausius-Mossotti relation holds for helium with a relative error less than 10\u22124\nfor \u03b4 \u03c1 /\u03c1 up to 0.1, well beyond the strains discussed here (less than 10\u22122 ). Because of the system\ncylindrical symmetry around the z-axis, \u03b4 n and \u03b4 \u03c1 only dep\npend on r = x2 + y2 and z. To measure \u03b4 \u03c6 (t), the laser beam is split before\nthe cell to produce a reference beam which crosses the cell in an unperturbed region and is recombined with the monitoring beam on a photo-detector, making\na Jamin interferometer. \u03b4 \u03c6 (t) contains a low frequency part \u03b4 \u03c6l f (t) due to the\ntransducer breathing mode (at \u03bdl f ), and the interesting signal \u03b4 \u03c6h f (t) due to the\nthickness oscillation (at \u03bdh f ). To extract the latter from \u03b4 \u03c6 (t), a model of the low\nfrequency signal Asl f (t \u2212t0 ) has been constructed with two adjustable parameters:\nits amplitude A and its starting time t0 . These parameters are determined from a\nfit of Asl f (t \u2212 t0 ) to \u03b4 \u03c6 (t) filtered with a low-pass filter. Then \u03b4 \u03c6h f (t) is found as\n\u03b4 \u03c6h f (t) = \u03b4 \u03c6 (t) \u2212 Asl f (t \u2212 t0 ).\nExtracting \u03b4 n(t) from \u03b4 \u03c6h f (t) is more involved. This amounts to determine a\ncharacteristic length a of the focused sound wave such that\n\n\u03b4 \u03c6h f (t, 0, 0) = 2\u03c0\u03b4 n(t, 0, 0)a/\u03bbo .\n\n(2)\n\nFor a continuous sinusoidal wave, a = \u03bbs /2 12 . There are two ways to get a. If one\ncan measure \u03b4 \u03c6h f (t, x, 0) for the whole range of x where it is non-zero, one can\n\n\f4\n\ninvert formula 1 and get \u03b4 n(t, x, 0) from \u03b4 \u03c6h f (t, x, 0) by an inverse Abel transform.\nThis is not always possible however due to the small width of the notch. A simpler\nmethod relies on numerical simulation to get the ratio \u03b4 \u03c6h f (t, 0, 0)/n(t, 0, 0) and\nthus a. In the following, results are discussed using the optical length variations\n\u03b4 Lopt = \u03bbo \u03b4 \u03c6h f /(2\u03c0 ) as the signal instead of \u03b4 \u03c6h f .\n3 Numerical simulation of a focused spherical sound wave\nSince solid helium has a close-packed hexagonal structure (hcp), its linear elastic properties are described by five elastic constants, c11 , c12 , c13 , c33 , c44 as\ndefined by Musgrave 13 . The ratio of shear stress to shear strain in the meridian\nplane, called c55 is not an independent constant in hcp crystals 14 and is equal to\n(c11 \u2212 c12 )/2. Numerical values of the ci j have been taken from 15 : c11 /\u03c1 = 21.2,\nc12 /\u03c1 = 11.1, c13 /\u03c1 = 5.49, c33 /\u03c1 = 29.0, and c44 /\u03c1 = 6.52, all in units of\n104 (m/s)2 .\nThe axis of the transducer being parallel to the c-axis of the crystal, deformations are of cylindrical symmetry. Elastic waves are thus governed by two coupled\nsecond order differential equations for the only two possible components of the\ndisplacement vector, ur and uz :\n\n\u2202 2 ur 1 \u2202 ur ur\n\u2202 2 uz\n\u2202 2 ur\n+\n\u2212\n)\n+\n(c\n+\nc\n)\n+\nc\n13\n55\n55\n\u2202 r2\nr \u2202r\nr2\n\u2202 r\u2202 z\n\u2202 z2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2202 ur 1 \u2202 ur\n\u2202 uz\n\u2202 uz 1 \u2202 uz\n+\n) + c33 2 + c55 ( 2 +\n)\n\u03c1 \u00fcz = (c13 + c55 )(\n\u2202 r\u2202 z r \u2202 z\n\u2202z\n\u2202r\nr \u2202r\n\n\u03c1 \u00fcr = c11 (\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n(c44 plays no role in this geometry)\nSpecial care must be taken in r = 0: for symmetry reasons, ur , u\u0307r and \u00fcr must\nbe 0 in r = 0. Using the l'Hospital's rule, equation 4 can be rewritten:\n\n\u03c1 \u00fcz = 2(c13 + c55 )\n\n\u2202 2 ur\n\u2202 2 uz\n\u2202 2 uz\n+ c33 2 + 2c55 2\n\u2202 r\u2202 z\n\u2202z\n\u2202r\n\n(r = 0)\n\n(5)\n\nThese equations are integrated using a finite difference method and a staggered leap frog scheme with initial conditions corresponding to an undeformed\ncrystal at rest. The model volume is 0 \u2264 r \u2264 7.5 and \u22127.5 \u2264 z \u2264 7.5 (in mm)\nand is discretized on a 1024 \u00d7 2048 grid. The spatial step \u03b4 l is then small enough\ncompared to the wavelength (\u03bbs \u2243 0.5 mm) that the dispersion introduced by the\ndiscretization is negligible. The time step \u03b4 t is taken to be sufficiently small to fulfill the Courant criterion: essentially one must have \u03b4 l/\u03b4 t < \u03bbs \u03bdh f . At each time\nstep t one then calculates a new field of displacement vectors with the help of the\nabove mentioned differential equations as a function of the fields at time t \u2212 \u03b4 t\nand t \u2212 2\u03b4 t. The field is then adjusted so as to fulfill the boundary conditions: ur\nand uz are forced to be that of the transducer on the points belonging to it and\nuz (r = 0, z) is adjusted to the value uz (0, z) = (4uz (\u03b4 l, z) \u2212 uz (2\u03b4 l, z))/3 to ensure\ncancelation of its derivative \u2202\u2202urz (r = 0, z). The other boundaries are left free, giving\nrise to reflected waves, which arrive at the focus with a long enough delay to be of\nno concern. From the displacement vector field, the change in molar volume can\nbe computed (\u03b4 Vm /Vm = \u2202\u2202urr + urr + \u2202\u2202uzz ) and thus the change in refractive index\n\n\f5\n\u22126\n\nx 10\n5\n\nz (mm)\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22125\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\nx (mm)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFig. 1 Map in the zx-plane of the refractive index variations while the mono-oscillation sound\nwave is propagating.

At the center one thus expects two pulses, as confirmed\nby Figure 2-a. When passing through the center, the r-wave undergoes a Gouy\nphase reversal. As a result the r-pulse is tripolar instead of being bipolar like the\nz-pulse. Note that this is true only at the center, because only at the center does\nthe incoming and the outgoing waves interfere. An important result is the amplification factor. The z-pulse is almost not amplified, while the r-pulse is amplified\n\n\u22125\n\n6\n\n\u22123\n\nx 10\n\n5\n\n4\n\nx 10\n\n0\n\nx20\n(\u03bcm)\n\n0\n\nopt\n\n\u03b4n\n\n2\n\n\u03b4L\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22125\n\u221210\n\n\u22124\n\u221215\n\n\u22126\n\u22128\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n\u221220\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n15\n\nFig. 2 (a) Refractive index modulation near the transducer surface (dashed line) and at the center\n(solid line).

This is not much less than the factor 75 expected for an isotropic\nmedium with the same \u03bbs . Figure 2 also shows the behavior of the optical length\nthrough the center of the transducer. A first striking result is that the optical length\nis vanishingly small for almost all times, although the integration path crosses the\nwave at any time. This is because the positive and the negative parts of the wave\ncancel almost exactly. Only when the wave reaches the center is this no more true.\nThe z-pulse seems to be magnified, but this is only a geometrical effect due to\nthe fact that this part of the wave is almost plane and perpendicular to the z-axis.\nThe ratio between the maximum amplitude of the optical length and the maximum\namplitude of the index modulation is a characteristic length a (a \u2243 0.28 mm). It\ncan be used to deduce the refractive index modulation, which is the quantity of\ninterest, from the optical length, which is the measured quantity.\n4 Presentation and discussion of some results\nAn example of observed optical signal \u03b4 Lopt (t) is shown in Figure 3-a. It was\ntaken with a driving voltage Vd = 200 V at T = 1.16 K and a pressure 0.6 bar above\nPf (T ). An order of magnitude of the sound amplitude at the transducer surface can\nevaluated from the formula \u03b4 \u03c1 /\u03c1 = 2\u03c0 d33Vd /\u03bbs fr , where d33 = 0.3 nm/V is the\npiezoelectric constant at room temperature of the transducer ceramic, and fr \u2243 4\nis an order of magnitude of its reduction factor at low temperatures 16 . One finds\n\u03b4 \u03c1 /\u03c1 \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 , which can be converted to an acoustic pressure \u03b4 P = 54 mbar\nusing solid helium bulk modulus Bs = 269 bar. 17 . Thus the minimum pressure at\nthe transducer surface is well above the melting pressure. Note that for low sound\namplitudes (\u03b4 \u03c1 /\u03c1 < 10\u22122 ), the computation of \u03b4 P using the bulk modulus instead\nof a non linear equation of state does not lead to a relative error larger than 10\u22122 .\n\n0.015\n0.02\n0.01\n0.01\n\u03b4Lopt (\u03bcm)\n\n\u03b4L\n\nopt\n\n(\u03bcm)\n\n0.005\n0\n\u22120.005\n\u22120.01\n\n0\n\n\u22120.01\n\n\u22120.02\n\n\u22120.015\nz\u2212pulse\n\u22120.02\n8\n\n10\n\n\u22120.03\n\nr\u2212pulse\n12\nt (\u03bcs)\n\n(a)\n\n14\n\n16\n\n8\n\nz\u2212pulse\n10\n\nr\u2212pulse\n12\nt (\u03bcs)\n\n14\n\n16\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 3 Observed optical length modulation by focused sound pulses. Time origin is the beginning of the transducer oscillation which lasts 1 \u03bc s. Arrows indicate the middle of expected z- and\nr-pulses. (a) driving voltage 200 V, initial offset from melting pressure 0.6 bar, pressure swing\nat focus -0.35 bar. (b) Same signal with parameter values 600 V, 0.1 bar, -0.9 bar respectively.\n\nComparison of the optical signal with Figure 2-b helps to identify the radial\nwave. The expected time of flight is indicated by the arrow labeled 'r-pulse'. Note\n\n\f7\n\nthat in Figures 2 and 3 the origin of time is the beginning of the transducer oscillation. To get the time of flight for the middle of the sound pulse, half its duration\nis to be subtracted, namely 0.5\u03bc s. The sound velocity at this particular pressure is\ndetermined using the scaling of c11 and c33 proposed by Maris 1 . For this signal,\nthe laser beam is thought to cross the focal region. In fact extensive scanning of\nthe focal region along the x and z-axis with the laser beam was performed to locate\nthe sound focus.\nThe shape of the r-pulse is qualitatively similar to the expected one. The width\nin time measured by the delay between the secondary maximums is close to the\n1.0 \u03bc s delay in Figure 2-b. There are several differences however. Some are parasitic effects. The high frequency modulation may be attributed to higher oscillation modes of the transducer which are found near 2.4 MHz and 3.6MHz. Oscillations before the expected z-pulse can be explained by the fact that the reference\nlight beam is slightly perturbed by the wave emitted by the rim of the piezohemisphere.The distance between this rim and the reference beam is 4 mm and\nthus the sound wave reaches it in 7 \u03bc s. Concerning the r-pulse itself, the ratio of\nthe main peak amplitude to the secondary maximums is much smaller than in the\nsimulation. This could be due to an offset of the laser beam from the radial geometry or spatial averaging over the laser waist. Simulation shows that an offset of\n0.1 mm would divide the peak by a factor 3.\nThere is not a clear evidence for the z-pulse. It is either absent or hidden by\nparasitic oscillations. Its weakening may be correlated to that of the r-pulse peak.\nAnother possible explanation is that the initially well oriented mono-crystal has\nbeen broken and turned to a more or less isotropic polycrystal by the sound wave.\nAs a matter of fact, during long measurement series for scanning the laser beam\nposition, we occasionally observed evolution of the optical signal, generally a\nweakening of the pulse amplitude.\nLet us come back to the intensity of the negative swing at focus. Using the\nvalue of a determined by the simulation (a = 0.28 mm), one gets an order of\nmagnitude of the negative pressure swing from the formula \u03b4 P = \u03b4 Lopt Bs /a(n \u2212\n1) \u2243 \u22120.35 bar. The initial pressure was 0.6 bar from the melting pressure, so that\nthe minimum pressure does not reach the melting line. Figure 3-b shows another\nsignal taken with a larger driving voltage (600 V) and starting closer to the melting\nline, P \u2212 Pf = 0.11 bar. The signal is clearly more distorted than in Figure 3-a. If\none converts nevertheless the negative swing into pressure using the same formula\nquoted above, one gets \u03b4 P = \u22120.9 bar. In that case, it appears that the pressure\nhas crossed the equilibrium melting line by at least 0.8 bar.\nHas helium remained in the solid phase? Had a liquid droplet nucleated at the\nfocus, it would have expanded for a fraction of the sound half period at a velocity\nclose to the sound velocity. Thus it would have reached a diameter on the order of\n100 \u03bc m. Taking into account the refractive index difference between liquid and\nsolid phases (about 0.0035), the liquid bubble would have created a jump in \u03b4 Lopt\nas large as 0.35 \u03bc m. Also a large asymmetry would be found between positive and\nnegative pressure swings. Neither of the two phenomena are observed and it can\nbe concluded that transient melting did not occur.\n\n\f8\n\n5 Possible improvements and conclusions\nA direct interferometric imaging has been developed 18 to provide a map of \u03b4 Lopt .\nIt uses the same interferometer, but the laser is a pulsed laser and the detector a\nCCD camera. Images are taken for various t and reference phases. Then a map\nof \u03b4 \u03c6 (t, x, z) can be computed for all the pixels in parallel. Beside providing a\ndirect image of the sound pulse propagation in the crystal, inverse Abel transform\nwill give access to the map of \u03b4 n(t, r, z), provided that it has a cylindrical symmetry. This should overcome the major shortcoming in the present experiment,\nnamely the conversion from the measured \u03b4 Lopt to the pressure swing \u03b4 P at the\nfocus. Since the observed signal differs from the simulation, a more direct way\nto computed the latter will be valuable. It will also avoid scanning the laser beam\nto locate the focus, which is both time consuming and harmful for the crystal. In\norder to view the focus and an extended portion of the x-axis, the lower part of\nthe hemispherical transducer will be shorten by 1 mm or so. This new method will\nalso help assessing whether the crystal is broken by repetitive sound pulses. If this\nis the case, it would be of interest to try to work with a polycrystal with grains\nsmaller than \u03bbs . The medium will then be quasi-isotropic 19 . Whether the sound\nattenuation will be acceptable remains an open question. In the case monocrystals\nsurvive their repetitive stress, it would be more efficient to use a transducer with\na shape conforming the wavesurface of the hcp crystal, or at least half of it. As\ndepicted in reference 10 , it is an elongated bowl, nearly conical in the directions\nbetween z and x-axis. Finally using longer multi-oscillation excitation pulses will\nallow to reach oscillation amplitudes \u03b4 P about 10 times larger. The more complex\nwave pattern will not be a problem if inverse Abel transform can be performed.\nTo summarize, it has been shown that interesting motivations exist to investigate solid helium below the melting pressure. Numerical simulations confirmed\nthat sound waves can be efficiently focused in the anisotropic hcp crystal and provides a tool to investigate the metastable region below the melting curve. A first\nexample of incursion in this domain has been reported, and perspectives exist to\nenlarge the explored domain.\nAcknowledgements We acknowledge support from ANR, grant 05-BLAN-0084-01.\n\nReferences\n1.
