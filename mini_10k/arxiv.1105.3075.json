We find a anisotropic charge and spin thermopower with a C2v\nsymmetry. The angular dependence on the magnetization orientation of the ferromagnetic layer\nis substantiated by a phenomenological theory based on the symmetry of the effective spin-orbit\ninteraction induced by the topology of the spiral magnetic order in the multiferroic barrier.\n\n1\n\n\fWith the recent advances in fabrication, patterning and measurement techniques of artificial nanostructures, thermoelectricity has gained renewed interest with a particular focus\non potential applications [1\u20133], specially for the development of electronic devices with low\npower consumption. Thermoelectric transport is well studied theoretically and experimentally for a variety of systems such as quantum dots [4, 5], molecular junctions [6], and magnetic tunnel junctions [7\u20139]. Recently, a qualitatively original phenomena, the Spin-Seebeck\neffect, was discovered by Uchida et al. [10, 11]: In a ferromagnetic material (Ni81 Fe19 ) a\nheat current leads to a pure spin current without a charge current. This surprising effect\nhas by now been confirmed experimentally for insulating ferrimagnets (LaY2 Fe5 O12 in [12]),\nand for ferromagnetic semiconductors (GaMnAs [13]) as well. In these experiments, the\nspin-Seebeck coefficient was found to be quite smaller than the charge-Seebeck coefficient.\nHowever, in contrast to bulk ferromagnets, the spin thermopower in a quantum dot is theoretically predicted to be on the same order of magnitude as the charge thermopower [4, 5].\nAlong this line we inspect in this work the thermoelectricity in a normal-metal/helicalmultiferroic/ferromagnetic heterojunctions such as Pt/TbMnO3 /SrRuO3 (cf. Fig.1). The\ncoexistence of coupled electric and magnetic order parameters in multiferroics [14] holds the\npromise of futuristic opportunities for spintronics devices [15, 16] with the particular advantage of being electrically [17] and/or magnetically [18] controllable. The essential point is\nthat due to the topology of the local magnetic moments in multiferroic insulator, a traversing carrier experiences an effective spin-orbit interaction [16]. As shown by Hatimi et al. [8],\nthe thermoelectric effects significantly depend on the relative angle of the magnetization in\nneighboring magnetic layers of the ferromagnetic/normal-metal/ferromagnetic heterojunctions. Moreover, in the presence of the spin-orbit interaction, we expect that the tunnel\nmagnetoresistance should show a spatial anisotropy in a ferromagnetic/insulator/normalmetal heterojunction [16, 19, 20]. Similarly, we find that the non-collinear magnetic order\nin the oxide together with the induced spin-orbit coupling result in uniaxial spin and charge\nthermopower with a C2v symmetry.\nA sketch of the system is shown in Fig.1. A magnetic tunnel junction consisting of\nan ultrathin helical-multiferroic (MF) barrier (usually an oxide) is sandwiched between a\nnormal metal (NM) lead and a ferromagnetic (FM) conductor. No voltage is applied across\nthe junction. A steady temperature difference (TN M 6= TF M ) between the FM and NM\nelectrodes is induced. As the transmission is spin dependent, the temperature gradient may\n2\n\n\flead to a spin accumulation in the electrodes, which generally results in a nonzero spinvoltage bias \u2206Vs = (\u03b4\u03bcF M \u2212 \u03b4\u03bcN M )/e, where e is the electron charge and \u03b4\u03bci = \u03b4\u03bci\u2191 \u2212 \u03b4\u03bci\u2193\nwith \u03b4\u03bci\u03c3 being the electrochemical potential of the spin \u03c3 to the right or to the left of the\noxide barrier. In the linear response regime (which is assumed here), the spin dependent\ncurrent is written as [7],\nI\u03c3 = eL0\u03c3 \u2206\u03bc\u03c3 +\n\ne\nL1\u03c3 \u2206T\nT\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03bc\u03c3 = e\u2206V\u03c3 is the difference in the chemical potentials of the two leads in the spin\nchannel \u03c3 = \u00b11(or \u2191\u2193), and \u2206V\u03c3 = \u2206Ve + \u03c3\u2206Vs with \u2206Ve being the charge bias. \u2206T is the\napplied temperature difference. The kinetic coefficients Ln\u03c3 are defined as [21]\nLn\u03c3\n\n1\n=\u2212\n~\n\nZ\n\ndE\n\u2202f (E)\n(E \u2212 \u03bc)n T\u03c3 (E)\n2\u03c0\n\u2202E\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f (E) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function. T\u03c3 (E) is the spin-dependent transmission probability through the tunnel junction. The charge and the spin current are thus\ngiven as Ie = I\u2191 + I\u2193 , Is = I\u2191 \u2212 I\u2193 , respectively. We assume the spin-orbit interaction in\nthe electrodes to be negligible, hence the two spin channels are independent. A nonzero\nspin current can be driven by the temperature difference through the system in absence of\na charge current Ie = 0 as observed in the spin-Seebeck effect [10]. In the present study,\nwe derive the thermoelectric and thermospin coefficients in the presence of the spin accumulation. To find the spin-dependent Seebeck coefficient S\u03c3 , we inspect the limit of the\nsimultaneous vanishing of both the spin current and the charge current; or equivalently a\nzero charge current in each spin channel, i.e. I\u03c3 = 0,\nS\u03c3 =\n\n1 L1\u03c3\n\u2206V\u03c3\n=\u2212\n.\n\u2206T\neT L0\u03c3\n\n(3)\n\nAnalogously, the spin thermopower Ss and the charge thermopower are calculated as,\n\n1\n\u2206Vs\n= (S\u2191 \u2212 S\u2193 ),\n\u2206T\n2\n\u2206Ve\n1\nSe =\n= (S\u2191 + S\u2193 ).\n\u2206T\n2\n\nSs =\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nNeglecting the relatively much smaller potential modification due to the depolarizing field\nin the multiferroic barrier, and assuming that the barrier potential has a rectangular shape\n3\n\n\fwith the height V0 , the Hamiltonian describing the tunneling across the heterojunction reads\n[16], H = Hm + HM F . Hm stands for the itinerant carriers in the two metal electrodes,\nHm = \u2212\n\n~2 2\n\u2207 \u2212 \u0398(z \u2212 d)\u2206m * \u03c3\n2me\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the vector of Pauli matrices, m = [cos \u03c6, sin \u03c6, 0] is a unit vector defining the inplane magnetization direction in the ferromagnet with respect to the [100] crystallographic\ndirection, and \u2206 describes the Zeeman splitting in the FM electrode. \u0398(z) is the Heaviside\nstep function. me is the free-electron mass and d is the thickness of the barrier. In the oxide\ninsulator, the carrier dynamics is governed by the exchange model,\nHM F = \u2212\n\n~2 2\n\u2207 + Jnr * \u03c3 + V0 , for 0 \u2264 z \u2264 d\n2m\n\n(7)\n\nwhere m is the effective electron mass of the oxide ( m/me \u2248 3). Jnr is the exchange field,\nwhere nr is given by the multiferroic oxide local magnetization at each spiral layer (labeled\nby the integer number l) along the z-axis [22], i.e., nr = (\u22121)l [sin \u03b8r , 0, cos \u03b8r ] with \u03b8r = qm *r\nand qm = [q, 0, 0] being the spiral spin-wave vector. In effect the exchange coupling acts on\nthe electron as a non-homogenous magnetic field. Performing a local unitary transformation\nwithin the barrier [15], we conclude that the influence of the barrier amounts to the spindependent potential\nef f\nHSO\n= w(\u03b8r , k) * \u03c3\n\n(8)\n\nw(\u03b8r , k) = [J(z) sin \u03b8r , q\u0303kx , J(z) cos \u03b8r ]\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\n\nand q\u0303 =\n\n~2\nq.\n2m\n\nThis effective spin-orbit interaction results in a tunneling anisotropic magne-\n\ntoresistance (TAMR) effect[16]. Hence, we can expect a similar anisotropic behavior of the\nthermopower, as well.\nIn the present study, we assume a barrier of two to five layers (as in [23]) such that the\n\u03c3\neffective spin-orbit interaction HM\nF throughout the multiferroic barrier is reduced to the\n\u03c3\n \u0304\n \u0304\n \u0304\nplane of the barrier, H\u0304M\nF = w\u0304(\u03b8r , k) * \u03c3\u03b4(z) with w\u0304(\u03b8r , k) = [J sin \u03b8r , q\u0304kx , J cos \u03b8r ]. J and\n\nq\u0304 are renormalized exchange and resonant spin-orbit coupling parameters, q\u0304 \u2248 qdme /m and\nJ \u0304 \u2248 hJ(z)id referring to space and momentum averages with respect to the unperturbed\nstates at the Fermi energy. In the following, we treat J \u0304 and q\u0304 as adjustable parameters. The\ntransmissivity of a spin-\u03c3 electron through the multiferroic tunnel junctions reads\n\u0015\n\u0014\nk\u03c3\u0304\nk\u03c3\n2\n2\n|t\u03c3,\u03c3 | + |t\u03c3,\u03c3\u0304 |\nT\u03c3 (E, kk , \u03b8r ) = R\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n4\n\n(10)\n\n\fwhere the transmission (t\u03c3,\u03c3 and t\u03c3,\u03c3\u0304 ) coefficients can be analytically obtained by solving for\nthe scattering states in the different regions [16]. \u03ba and k\u03c3 are the transverse wave vectors\nin NM and FM subsystems, respectively,\ns\n\u03ba=\n\nk\u03c3 =\n\nE/\n\ns\n\n~2\n\u2212 kk2 ,\n2me\n\n(E + \u03c3\u2206)/\n\n~2\n\u2212 kk2 ,\n2me\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nwhere kk denotes the conserved electron momentum parallel to the junction interfaces.\nIntroducing the transmissivity T\u03c3 (E, kk , \u03b8) into Eq.(2), the kinetic coefficients are rewritten as,\n1\nLn\u03c3 (\u03c6) = \u2212\nh\n\nZ\n\ndE\n\nd2 kk d\u03b8\n\u2202f (E)\n(E \u2212 \u03bc)n T\u03c3 (E, kk , \u03b8)\n2\n(2\u03c0) 2\u03c0\n\u2202E\n\n(13)\n\nBased on a general symmetry considerations of the spin-orbit interaction[24] and phenomenological calculations [16] the angular-dependence of Ln\u03c3 (\u03c6) is found to exhibit a two fold symmetry, \u223c cos 2\u03c6. Consequently, the charge and spin thermopower are spatially anisotropic.\nWe performed numerical calculations for kB T = 4meV with \u03bc = 5.0eV , \u2206 = 2eV ,\nV0 = 0.5eV , and d = 1nm. Fig.2 presents the dependence of the thermopower on the\nmagnetization direction in the FM electrode. As evident from the numerical results, the spin\nand the charge thermopower show the C2v symmetry, as follows from the phenomenological\nmodel. We note, the spin thermopower Ss is about three orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe charge thermopower Se , which is different from the case of a quantum dot where Ss\ncan be as large as Se [4]. Ss changes sign as voltage induced in the minority spin channel\nis higher. For the charge thermopower, the amplitude of the angular-dependence of Se\nis quite small, which is on the same order as the tunnel anisotropic magnetoresistance in\nFe/GaAs/Au tunnel junction that have been recently realized experimentally [25]. However,\nSs changes with \u03c6 from positive to negative, we have a quite large tunnel anisotropic spin\nthermopower, [(Ss (\u03c6) \u2212 Ss (0))/(Ss (\u03c6) + Ss (0))]max \u2248 18.\nSummarizing, we studied the angular-dependence of the thermoelectric transport through\nthe helical-multiferroic tunnel junctions, both the spin and charge thermopower are found to\nexhibit an anisotropic behavior due to the spiral magnetic order together with an induced\nspin-orbit interaction in the multiferroic spacer. Based on the magnetoelectric coupling,\nthe strength of the effective spin-orbit coupling is electrically/magnetically controllable and\n5\n\n\fthus the spin and charge thermopower in the helimagnetic tunnel junctions. For practical\napplications a multilayer configuration might be more appropriate to enhance the effect.\nThis work is supported by the German Science Foundation, DFG through SFB762 -B7functionality of oxide interfaces.\n\n6\n\n\f[1] M.
