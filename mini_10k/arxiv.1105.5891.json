Introduction\nDiversity phenomenon exist widely in economic systems. As we observed, individual consumptions become more diversified when people get\nEmail address: zhangjiang@bnu.edu.cn (Lunchao Hu, Kailan Tian, Xin Wang and\nJiang Zhang)\nPreprint submitted to Physica A\n\nOctober 9, 2018\n\n\fricher[1]; organizations demand for more diverse human resource, products\nand investments when they become larger[2]; and countries can export more\nkinds of products and services to other countries as their economies are\nstronger. Nathan et.al. has discussed the relationship between the network diversity and economic development by a large data set of individual\ncommunication[3]. Templet discovered that the economic diversity generally\nincreases in regional economy[4]. However, so far, this kind of researches who\naddressed the diversity phenomena in economics, especially the quantitative\npatterns based on empirical data, are very sparse.\nNevertheless, compared to the situation in economics, there are many\nstudies on diversity phenomena in ecology both from the empirical data\nand theoretical models[5\u20138]. We can borrow some useful conceptions and\nmethods from the ecology to study the economic diversity because these two\n\"eco\" systems have lots of similarities and commonalities[9, 10]. For example, the relationship between the number of species and the area[5], or the\nproductivity[8] of the habitat have been widely discussed in ecology. This\nrelationship inspired us to find the similar relationship between the export\ndiversity which is compared to the species diversity and the economic size\n(GDP) of a country which is compared to the area or productivity of a habitat\nin international trade.\nAlthough Krugman et al. have touched the problem of the relationship\nbetween the number of different kinds of export goods (export diversity)\nand the size of a country (population) in their classic international trade\nmodel[11, 12], they simply assumed that this relationship is linear without\nany support of empirical data[13, 14]. Recently, Petersson has studied the\nexport diversity and intra-industry trade in Southern Africa[15]. Johansson and Nilsson reported R&D accessibility and regional export diversity in\nSweden[16]. Although these studies were based on the empirical data, they\nonly focused on a specific country or region but not the universal pattern on\nthe global.\nIn this paper, we use the highly detailed international trade data during\n1971-2000 to investigate the relationship between the export diversity of a\ncountry which is measured by counting the categories of export goods and\nthe size of an economy which is measured by its GDP. Based on the data, we\nfind that a nation with higher GDP level will indeed export a wider variety\nof goods, however, this dependence can be described by an S-shaped curve\n(fitted by a logistic equation) which is one of the most important universal\npatterns in complex systems[17\u201319] rather than the common linear or power\n2\n\n\flaw relations[5]. Furthermore, we find that the S-shaped curve is ubiquitous\nbecause it can be applied to the relationships between other diversity-related\nvariables such as the number of different kinds of import goods, the number\nof exporters, etc. and economic size. While the relationships between any\npair of the diversity-related variables can be described by power laws.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we briefly introduce\nthe data source. Section 3 proposes our main results. Subsection 3.2 discusses the classification of countries into three stages. We show how robust\nand stable the pattern is in subsection 3.3. And also, we discuss how the key\nparameters in S-shaped curves indicate the dynamical change of the global\neconomy. In section 4, more relationships on diversity of international economics are discussed. At last, section 5 points out that although this paper\ndoes not provide any explanation of the S-shaped curves, it reveals a robust\nand promising pattern which is the first step of the study on the economic\ndiversity phenomenon.\n2. Data\nOur analysis is based on the world GDP statistics from the World Bank\nweb-site (www.worldbank.org) and the bilateral trade statistics from NBERUN world trade database (www.nber.org/data). The former records the\nname of nearly 240 countries, as well as their GDP, population, etc. from\n1971 to 2006, while the latter records the importer, exporter, 4-digit categories, the value and quantity of each bilateral trade from 1962 to 2000[20].\nWhen dealing with the NBER-UN trade data, we calculated the total\nnumber of the categories of export commodities[5] for each country as the\nmeasurement of the export diversity. We have also tried other indices such as\nShannon entropy to measure the export diversity[15, 16], but they can't give\nuniversal and well-fitted patterns. The countries without the export diversity\nor GDP data are ignored. Thus, we got the full data of 126 countries from\n1971 to 1991, 148 countries from 1992 to 2000.\nThe NBER-UN trade data were constructed from United Nations trade\nflows over two periods: (i) 1962-1983, the data for which covered all trade\nflows that different products were classified by SITC Rev.1 standard (Standard International Trade Classification, Revision 1) and trading partners\nwith country codes; (ii) 1984-2000, same as the first data set except the\nproducts were classified by SITC Rev.2 standard.\n\n3\n\n\fIt is necessary to mention some historical background of the Standard\nInternational Trade Classification(SITC). SITC, Revision 1, represented an\nimprovement over the original SITC due to the increase of the volume of\ntrade and the diversity of commodity during l960-l968 as well as the limitation of the SITC. And also, in 1984, the Economic and Social Council further\nreplaced the SITC Rev.1 by SITC Rev.2 because of the same reason. Therefore, we know that it was the expansion of commodity diversity itself caused\nthe alteration of the classification standard but not the opposite. Hence, our\nresults are not dependent on the change of the classification standard.\n3. Results\n3.1. S-shaped curve\nAs the gravity model of trade theory has found, the trade flows (export/import volume or value) between any countries can be described by\na Newtonian gravity-like equation[21, 22]. That means the trade flows are\nthe power law functions[23] of the economic size of the importer or exporter.\nHowever, the export diversity has a very different dependence on GDP. Based\non the collected data, we plotted the original data and the estimated curve\nin Fig 1.\nFrom the data shown in Fig 1, we know that an S-shaped curve may fit\nthem very well. We use the logistic function like the following Equation:\ny=\n\nA\n1+\n\ne\u2212k(x\u2212XM )\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich are widely used in many disciplines[17] to characterize the empirical Sshaped data. In equation 1, y is the export diversity measured by the number\nof different categories of the export goods, and x represents log(GDP). A,\nXM and k are parameters to be estimated with the given data. A is the\nupper limit of the diversity of commodities. k is the slope on the inflection\npoint and represents the maximum relative growth rate of diversity. XM\nstands for the logarithmic GDP size at the inflection point (see Fig 1).\nThe S-shaped curve can be divided as three stages: in the first stage,\nwhen a nation's economic size (GDP) stays in a low level, the number of\nexport goods is naturally small and increases with a slower speed than the\ngrowth of GDP; in the second stage, their GDPs climb up to a relatively\nhigh level, and the growth rate of the diversity increases dramatically; in the\n4\n\n\f900\n800\n\nCategories of Export Goods\n\n700\n600\n\nUSA\n\noriginal data\nfitting curve:\n903/{1+exp[\u22121.85(x\u221210.7)]}\nleft cut\u2212off point\ninflection point\nright cut\u2212off point\nsample countries\n\nChina\nIndia\n\nNew\nZealand\n\n500\n400\n\nIran\n\nBelarus\n300\n200\n\nGuatemala\nNepal\n\n100\n0\n7\n\nLiberia\n\n8\n\nR2=0.86\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nlog(GDP)\n\nFigure 1: The original data and the \"S\" curve fitting of export diversity and log(GDP)\nfor all countries in 1995. The curve has three stages: initial stage, acceleration stage and\nfinal stage, which are determined by the three critical points (left cut-off point, inflection\npoint, and right cut-off point) which are denoted as triangles. Besides, some countries are\npicked out and are marked by the squares.\n\n5\n\n13\n\n\flast stage, the growth rate of diversity slows down and gradually falls behind\nGDPs again.\nBy means of Least Square (LS) method, we obtained the estimated values of parameters and some essential statistical data (R-square=0.86 and\nF-value=231). Accordingly, we claim that the logistic model can fit our data\nvery well. Besides, we also have studied the residuals of each empirical data\nand found that the residuals are larger for the middle-class countries, say in\nthe second stage. Therefore, the export diversity can be predicted by the\nlogistic function better in the first and third stages.\n3.2. Three stages\nFrom Fig 1, we know that the curve can be divided into three stages,\nnamely initial stage, acceleration stage, and final stage. However, there is no\nany unified and rigorous method to identify them. In this paper, we use the\nthree order derivative of the logistic function (Equation 1) to determine the\nstages accordingly,\nA\nd3 (\n)/dx3 = 0.\n(2)\n\u2212k(x\u2212X\nM)\n1+e\nSolving this equation, we can obtain two non-zero solutions, namely the left\ncut-off point (xL , yL ) and the right cut-off point (xR , yR ). We know that the\nleft cut-off point which can separate the initial stage and accelerating stage\nshould maximize the curvature of the curve. Therefore, setting the third\norder derivative equaling zero can obtain this separating point[24]. The same\nmethod follows for the right cut-off point separating the accelerating stage\nand the final stage.\nThere is another important point called inflection point (XM , YM ) whose\ncurvature is zero indicating the growth rate of the diversity reaches the maximum. We can get the analytic expressions of these important points in Table\n1.\nUntil now, the estimated curve in Fig 1 can be divided into three stages\nby the two cut-off points. In the initial stage, there are 71 countries including\nthe poorest countries and some developing countries such as Liberia, Nepal\netc. Most of them locate in Africa and Asia with less developed industries\nand shortage of natural resources. The acceleration stage with 56 countries\ncontains some developing and developed countries. Iran, the second largest\noil exporter, and Belarus, with developed industry and advanced agriculture,\nare all developing countries and locate below the inflection point. While,\nthe developed countries, such as New Zealand, Norway and Sweden, are at a\n6\n\n\fTable 1: The Coordinate of Three Important Points\n\n(We classify all the sample countries into three stages according to them.)\n\nLeft Cut-off Point\n(XL , YL )\u221a\nX-coordinate\nXM \u2212 ln(2+k 3)\nY-coordinate\n\nInflection Point\n(XM , YM )\nXM\n\nRight Cut-off Point\n(XR , YR )\u221a\nXM \u2212 ln(2\u2212k 3)\n\nA\n2\n\nA\u221a\n3\u2212 3\n\nA\u221a\n3+ 3\n\nhigh speed of diversity growing with a falling acceleration above the inflection\npoint. Finally, the third stage contains the most developed countries such\nas USA and Japan, with broad geographic and well-developed industries.\nHowever, China, with GDP topped the ninth in 1995, is also included in\nthis stage. Guatemala and India both are around the cut-off points. The\nformer one will welcome to a period of accelerating growth of export diversity\nwhile the later one has experienced the glorious moments and will step into\na period of lower diversity growth rate.\n3.3. Dynamics\nSo far, we have studied the S-shaped pattern between export diversity\nand log(GDP) only in one year. To look deeper into this pattern especially\non time, we fitted the collected data from 1971 to 2000 in the same way.\nHowever, because of the change of classification method in 1983 mentioned\nin section 2, we normalized the diversity data with the method below,\nYi\u2032 =\n\nYi \u2212 min {Yi }\n,\nmax {Yi } \u2212 min {Yi }\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Yi is the number of export goods categories of country i, Yi\u2032 represents\nthe normalized diversity which ranges from 0 to 1. Fig 2 shows the patterns\nin four different years with normalized data.\nIn Fig 2, two cut-off points and the inflection point are plotted in each\nyear. We can see that the S-shaped pattern is stable in these thirty years.\nThe shift and the expansion of the curves imply that the S-shaped pattern is\nmore obvious after 1990s. This phenomenon is also reflected by the goodness\nof fitting in the inset of Fig 2. R2 increases from 0.75 to around 0.83 in 1983,\nand fluctuates a little in the following years.\nWe can trace one specific country, China, which was undergoing dramatic\neconomic development in these years.

Thus, China stepped into the final stage.\nFrom Fig 3(a) we know that A fluctuates more intensive before 1983 and\nthen waves a little around 1. That means the S-shaped relation is more stable\nafter 1983. Fig 3(b) shows the change of k which is the relative maximum\ngrowth rate of export diversity in the thirty years. We know the value of\nk keeps increasing from 1.13(1981) to 1.81(1990) while remains relatively\nstable from 1971 to 1979 and 1991 to 2000. Thus, the S-shaped curves\nbecame steeper suddenly in about 1980-1985. This phenomenon can be also\nobserved from the dynamics of the three critical points. From Fig 4 we\nknow the change of XL , XM and XR values follow similar paths. In the first\ndecade, the three variables increase continually, and they remain 10.0, 10.7\nand 11.5 respectively with only small fluctuations after 1983. However, YL ,\nYM and YR values do not have much change and remain around their average\nvalue. Hence, the S-shaped curves move right gradually at first and stop\n9\n\n\f(b)\n1\n\n12\n\n0.9\n\n11.5\n\n0.8\n\n11\n\n0.7\n\n10.5\n\n0.6\n\nY\n\nX\n\n(a)\n12.5\n\n10\n\n0.5\nXL\n\n9.5\n\nYL\n\n0.4\n\nYM\n\nXM\nXR\n\n9\n8.5\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\nY\n\n0.3\n0.2\n1970\n\n2000\n\nTime\n\nR\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\nTime\n\nFigure 4: The dynamical trends of the two cut-off points and the inflection point during\nthe 30 years (a).

That indicates the global economy kept increasing during the\nfirst decade and then slowed down.\nWe believe that the dynamics of these parameters, especially the big fluctuations around 1983, indicate the changed situation of the international\ntrade environment[21]. First, we know that there was a serious global oil crisis in 1970s, as a result, the system of international trade changed in 1980s all\naround the world. Many countries abandoned the traditional inward-looking\ntrade, turned the export-substitution model of economic growth to exportoriented model. Second, the adjustment of the basic goal of market-oriented\neconomic structure had been made because of the boom of information and\nservice industries in 1980s. Furthermore, in order to adapt for the changes of\nthe trade environment, many countries made some change in 1980s. For instance, the United State of America changed their trade policy to multilateral\nfree trade system due to the oil crisis and depreciation. Japan, as another\nexample, also strengthened the multilateral trading system and developed\nthe global economy since 1980s.\nThus, when the environment of the international trade turns better, all\n10\n\n\f0.7\ninitial stage\nacceleration stage\nterminal stage\n\nProportion of Countries in Each Stage\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\nTime\n\nFigure 5: The proportions of countries in each stage change with time during the 30 years\n\ncountries tend to export more goods. This can be reflected by the maximum\ngrowth rate of export diversity, k, which can indicate the international trading circumstance. The environment changes better as it jumps to a higher\nlevel.\nBecause k increased and the total number of countries in the world almost\nunchanged in these years, we know that the proportion of the countries in\neach stage must have changed. From Fig 5 we know that the proportion\nof the countries in the initial stage increased while those in the acceleration\nstage fell down during 1980 to 1985. After 1985, both fluctuated little and the\ndifference between them became smaller. However, the proportion in the final\nstage almost remained around 0.1 all the time. This phenomenon may be\naccounted for the unbalanced development in different countries in the reform\n11\n\n\fTable 2: All the S-shaped Relationships\n\nx\ny\nlog(GDP)\nImporters\nlog(GDP)\nExporters\nlog(GDP) Import Goods\nlog(GDP) Export Goods\n\nA\n203\n197\n749\n903\n\nk\nXM\nR2\n1.09 10.94 0.89\n1.42 10.75 0.92\n1.66 9.65 0.87\n1.85 10.7 0.86\n\nof international trade policies as mentioned before. As the globalization\nprocess started, the gap of the export diversity between the rich and poor\ncountries became larger. Consequently, the countries which had climbed to\nthe acceleration stage fell down into the initial stage again.\n4. Discussion\nIn previous sections, we have discussed the S-shaped curves of the relationship between export diversity and log (GDP). However, we have also the\ndata of the other variables including the number of importers, the categories\nof import goods, and the number of exporters. So, we can explore more\nempirical patterns of diversity. In this section, we will point out that all the\nbivariate relationships fall into two classes, namely, S-shaped relationships\nand power law relationships.\n4.1. S-shaped relationships\nWe find that other diversity-related variables including the categories of\nimport goods, the number of distinct exporters and the number of distinct\nimporters are all have S-shaped relationship with the logarithmic GDP for\neach country. Fig 6(a) shows the relationship between the number of exporters and log(GDP) as an example, and all these \"S\" curves are concluded\nin Table 2.\nAs shown in Table 2, we know that the logistic function can fit all the\nrelationships between log (GDP) and importers, exporters, import goods and\nexport goods with high significances (R2 ). Nevertheless, the parameters (A, k\nand XM ) are very different which can also be divided into two groups. We\nknow that A is the upper limit and represents the range of diversity of trade.\nFrom Table 2, we observe that Aimport < Aexport for importers(exporters)\nbut Aimport > Aexport for import(export) goods. That means countries are\nmore likely to export fewer kinds of goods to more diverse countries. And\n12\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n200\n180\n\n140\n\nNumber of Exporters\n\nNumber of Exporters\n\n160\n\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n\nA=197\nXM=10.75\n\n20\n\nk=1.42\n2\nR =0.92\n\n0\n6\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u03b3=1.2\nc=0.45\n2\nR =0.91\n1\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10 1\n10\n\n14\n\nlog(GDP)\n\n2\n\n10\n\nNumber of Importers\n\nFigure 6: Other relationships about diversity in 1995.

So kimport < kexport always holds\nfor countries and goods, which means the export diversity grows faster than\nimport diversity as GDP grows.\n4.2. Power-law relationships\nScaling property is one of the most important universal quantitative laws\ngoverning different dynamics of complex systems [9, 23, 25\u201329]. In paper[23],\nthe authors have shown that the import value and export value of a country\nall have power law relationships with respect to GDP. In this paper, we find\nthe variables relating to diversity also follow the power law relationship:\nY = cX \u03b3 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere, X and Y are diversity-related variables such as the number of importers, categories of export goods etc. c and \u03b3 are parameters to be estimated. By using equation 4 to fit our empirical data, we obtain Fig 6(b) and\nTable 3.\nFig 6(b) shows the relationship between the number of importers and\nexporters as an example. From Table 3, we know that all power law relationships are significant because their R2 s are all larger than 0.6. And all\nthe relationships between import properties and export properties are superlinear[29] for \u03b3 > 1, which means that with the increase of import properties,\nexport properties can grow faster. So do the relationship between exporters\nand categories of export goods, that is to say one country may have more\nexporters for each export goods as the export goods diversity increases. However, the relationship between importers and import goods is sub-linear[29]\nmeaning that the growth speed of the categories of import goods is slower\nthan the number of importers.\n14\n\n\f5. Concluding Remarks\nWe have shown the S-shaped relationship between the number of different\nkinds of export commodities and log GDP, which is well fitted by the logistic\nfunction. We have also found the two cut-off points which can divide the\ncurve into three stages. In addition, we analyzed the dynamics of the parameters. Particularly, the parameter k increases suddenly in around 1980's\nwhich is supposed to indicate the change of international trade environment.\nFinally, we also discussed the other possible diversity-related properties all\nhave S-shaped relationships with respect to log GDP and power law relations\nwith other variables.\nAlthough this paper did not give any explanations about the origins of\nS-shaped curves and power law relationships, we believe that we have made\na first step to understand the economic diversity phenomenon because we\nhave revealed robust and universal patterns based on the empirical data.\nAcknowledgement.
