It had been known for a long time [5, 6, 7] that - contrary\nto the asymptotically flat spacetimes - the dominant (radiative) component of the\nfields is not unique since it depends substantially on the direction along which a null\ngeodesic approaches a given point at conformal infinity I. We demonstrated that,\nsomewhat surprisingly, such directional structure of radiation can be described in\nclosed explicit form. It has a universal character that is essentially determined by\nthe algebraic type of the field, i.e., by the specific local degeneracy and orientation\nof the principal null directions.\nOur results were summarized and thoroughly discussed in the recent topical\nreview [8]. They apply not only to electromagnetic or gravitational fields but to\nany field of spin s. In addition, the expression representing the directional behavior\nof radiation can be written in a unified form which covers all three possibilities\n\u039b > 0, \u039b < 0 or \u039b = 0, corresponding to a spacelike, timelike or null character\nof I, respectively.\nThis paper further elaborates and supplements some aspects of our work reviewed in [8]. It extends possible definitions of the canonical reference tetrad for\nthe algebraically simple fields - those which admit an equivalent pair of distinct\n(degenerate) principal null directions. We systematically describe the most natural\nchoices of the reference tetrad for all possible algebraic structures of type D fields,\nand for any value of \u039b.\n\u2217)\n\nDedicated to Prof. Ji\u0159\u0131\u0301 Hor\u00e1\u010dek on the occasion of his 60th birthday\n\nCzechoslovak Journal of Physics, Vol. 55 (2005), No. 2, 119\u2013138\n\n1\n\n\fPavel Krtou\u0161 and Ji\u0159\u0131\u0301 Podolsk\u00fd\n\nThe notation used in the present paper is the same as in [8]; in fact, we will\nfrequently employ the material already described and derived there. For brevity,\nwe will refer directly to the equations and sections of the review [8] by prefixing\nthe letter 'R' in front of the reference: equation (R.1.1), section R.2.1, etc.\n2\n\nSummary of general results\n\nWe wish to study the behavior of radiative component of fields near conformal infinity I. An overview of the concept of conformal infinity can be found in\ntextbooks (e.g., [9]; our notation is described in section R.2 of the work [8]).\nLet us only recall that it is possible to define a normalized vector n normal to the\nconformal infinity. The causal character of the infinity - spacelike, null, or timelike\n- is given by the sign of the square of this vector, \u03c3 = n * n = \u22121, 0, +1 (see also\nfigure 1). Here and in the following, the dot '*' denotes the scalar product defined\nusing the spacetime metric g. Typically, the causal character of I is correlated with\nthe sign of the cosmological constant, \u03c3 = \u2212 sign \u039b (see section R.2.2 for details).\n2.1\n\nNull tetrads\n\nTo study various components of the fields we introduce suitable orthonormal, and\nassociated with them null tetrads. We denote the vectors of an orthonormal tetrad\nas t, q, r, s, where t is a future oriented unit timelike vector. With this tetrad we\nassociate a null tetrad of null vectors k, l, m, m\u0304 by\nk=\n\n\u221a1 (t\n2\n\n+ q) , l =\n\n\u221a1 (t\n2\n\n\u2212 q) , m =\n\n\u221a1 (r\n2\n\n\u2212 i s) , m\u0304 =\n\n\u221a1 (r\n2\n\n+ i s) .\n\n(1)\n\nThe normalization conditions are\n\u2212t * t = q * q = r * r = s * s = 1 ,\n\n\u2212 k * l = m * m\u0304 = 1 ,\n\n(2)\n\nrespectively, with all other scalar products being zero.\nThe crucial tetrad in our study is the interpretation tetrad ki , li , mi , m\u0304i . It is a\ntetrad which is parallelly transported along a null geodesic z(\u03b7), the vector ki being\ntangent to the geodesic. With respect to this tetrad we define the radiative component of the field. The precise definition and description of asymptotic behavior\nof the interpretation tetrad was thoroughly presented in sections R.3.3 and R.3.4\nwhere more details can be found.\nHere, we are going to concentrate on the reference tetrad ko , lo , mo , m\u0304o . It is\na tetrad conveniently defined near the conformal infinity. It serves as the reference\nframe for parametrization of directions near I. It can be defined using special features of the spacetime geometry (e.g., the Killing vectors, direction toward sources,\netc.). Alternatively, it can be adapted to the studied fields - namely, it can be\n'aligned' with algebraically special directions of the fields under consideration. A\ngeneral situation was discussed in sections R.5.4 and R.5.5. In the present work we\nwill offer other possible privileged definitions of the reference tetrad for algebraically\nsimple fields of type D.\n2\n\nCzech. J. Phys. 55 (2005)\n\n\fAsymptotic directional structure of radiation for algebraically simple fields\n\nFig. 1. The reference tetrad adjusted to conformal infinity I of various character, determined by \u03c3 which is a norm of the vector n normal to I. If the vector ko is oriented along\nan outgoing direction (outward from the physical spacetime M) we have \u01ebo = +1, if it is\ningoing (oriented inward to M) then \u01ebo = \u22121.\n\nFollowing [8] we require that the reference tetrad is adjusted to conformal infinity, i.e., that the vectors ko and lo satisfy the relation\nn = \u01ebo \u221a12 (\u2212\u03c3ko + lo ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the sign \u01ebo = \u00b11 indicates the outgoing/ingoing orientation of the vector ko\nwith respect to I (see also below).

Additional necessary conditions - the alignment with the algebraically\nspecial directions - will be specified in section 3.\n2.2\n\nParametrization of null directions\n\nIn the following it will be necessary to parametrize a general null direction k near I.\nThis can be done with respect to the reference tetrad by a complex directional\nparameter R:\nk \u221d ko + R\u0304 mo + R m\u0304o + RR\u0304 lo .\n(5)\nThe value R = \u221e is also permitted - it corresponds to k oriented along lo .\nIn addition, we introduce the orientation parameter \u01eb which indicates whether\nthe null direction k is an outgoing direction (pointing outside the spacetime),\n\u01eb = +1, or if it is an ingoing direction (pointing inside the spacetime), \u01eb = \u22121.\nWhen the infinity I has a spacelike character it is also possible to parametrize\nthe null direction k using spherical angles which specify its normalized spatial\nprojection into I. We define the angles \u03b8, \u03c6 by\nq = cos \u03b8 qo + sin \u03b8 (cos \u03c6 ro + sin \u03c6 so ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere q is the unit vector pointing into the spatial (q * n = 0) direction given\nby k, see (R.5.5). The complex parameter R of (5) is actually a stereographic\nrepresentation of the spatial direction q:\nR = tan\n\n\u03b8\nexp(\u2212i\u03c6) .\n2\n\n(7)\n\nNear a timelike infinity I we can analogously describe null direction k by pseudospherical parameters \u03c8, \u03c6 of its projection into I. If we label the normalized\nprojection of k by t, cf. (R.5.8), \u03c8 and \u03c6 are given by\nt = cosh \u03c8 to + sinh \u03c8 (cos \u03c6 ro + sin \u03c6 so ) .\n\n(8)\n\nThese parameters have to be supplemented by the orientation \u01eb of k with respect\nto I. The parameter R is the pseudostereographic representation of t:\nR = tanh\u01eb\u01ebo\n\n\u03c8\nexp(\u2212i\u03c6) .\n2\n\n(9)\n\nIn fact, we can introduce both these parametrizations simultaneously, independently of the causal character of the infinity, just with respect to the reference\ntetrad - the angles \u03b8, \u03c6 using a projection onto the 3-space orthogonal to the time\nvector to of the reference tetrad, and the parameters \u03c8, \u03c6 using a projection to the\n2+1-space orthogonal to qo . In such a case they are related by expressions\ntanh \u03c8 = sin \u03b8 ,\n4\n\nsinh \u03c8 = tan \u03b8 ,\n\ncosh \u03c8 = cos\u22121 \u03b8 , tanh \u03c82 = tan \u03b82 .\n\n(10)\n\nCzech. J. Phys. 55 (2005)\n\n\fAsymptotic directional structure of radiation for algebraically simple fields\n\nIf the infinity has a timelike character, all future oriented null directions at one\npoint at I naturally split into two families of outgoing and ingoing directions. The\ndirections of each of these families form a hemisphere which can be projected onto\na unit circle parametrized by \u03c1 and \u03c6, such that\n\u03c1 = tanh \u03c8 = sin \u03b8 ,\n\n(11)\n\nsee also figure R.3.\n2.3\n\nAsymptotic directional structure of radiation\n\nThe main result of the paper [8] is derivation of the explicit dependence of the\nradiative component of the field on a direction along which the infinity is approached\n- we call this dependence the asymptotic directional structure of radiation.\nIn [8] we investigated a general spin-s field, and in more detail gravitational\n(s = 2) and electromagnetic (s = 1) fields. These fields can be characterized by\n2s + 1 complex components \u03a5j , j = 0, . . . , 2s, evaluated with respect to a null\ntetrad. Relation of these components to a spinor representation of the fields, and\ntheir transformation properties can be found in R.4.1 and appendix R.B. The\ncomponents of gravitational and electromagnetic fields are traditionally called \u03a8j ,\nj = 0, . . . , 4, and \u03a6j , j = 0, 1, 2, respectively - see [10] or equations (R.4.1) and\n(R.4.2).\nTo study the asymptotic behavior we evaluated the field with respect to the\ninterpretational tetrad - the tetrad which is parallelly transported along a null\ngeodesic z(\u03b7). It turned out that these field components satisfy the standard peelingoff property, namely that they exhibit a different fall-off in \u03b7 when approaching I,\n\u03b7 being the affine parameter of the geodesic. The leading component of the field\ni\nis the component \u03a52s\nwith the fall-off of order \u03b7 \u22121 , and we call it the radiative\ncomponent. In sections R.4.3 and R.4.4 we found that the radiative field component depends on the direction R of the null geodesic along which a fixed point at\nthe infinity is approached. This directional structure is determined mainly by the\nalgebraic structure of the field, and it reads\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 s o 1 \u2212 \u03c3R1 R\u0304 1 \u2212 \u03c3R2 R\u0304 . . . 1 \u2212 \u03c3R2s R\u0304\ni\n\u0001s\n\u03a52s \u2248 \u01ebo \u03a52s\u2217\n.\n(12)\n\u03b7\n1 \u2212 \u03c3RR\u0304\nThe complex constants R1 , . . . , R2s represent the principal null directions k1 , . . . , k2s\nof the spin-s field, the sign \u03c3 = \u00b11, 0 specifies the causal character of the conformal infinity, \u01ebo denotes orientation of the reference tetrad, and \u03a5o2s\u2217 is a constant\nnormalization factor of the field evaluated with respect to the reference tetrad,\n\u03a5o2s \u2248 \u03a5o2s\u2217 \u03b7 \u2212s\u22121 (cf. section R.4.4).\nThe principal null directions (PNDs) are special directions along which some\nof the field components vanish - see [9, 10] or section R.4.2 for a precise definition. The field of spin s has 2s PNDs. However, these can be degenerate, and\nthis degeneracy (or, more generally, mutual relations of all the PNDs) is called the\nalgebraic structure of the field. Distinct PNDs are also called algebraically special\nCzech. J. Phys. 55 (2005)\n\n5\n\n\fPavel Krtou\u0161 and Ji\u0159\u0131\u0301 Podolsk\u00fd\n\ndirections of the field. The classification according to the degeneracy of PNDs for\na gravitational field is the well-known Petrov classification.\n3\n\nFields of type D\n\nIn this paper we wish to discuss the situation when the field has two distinct\nand equivalent algebraically special directions. This may occur only for fields of an\ninteger spin, s \u2208 N, with PNDs having the degeneracy\nk1 = * * * = ks\n\nand ks+1 = * * * = k2s .\n\n(13)\n\nThe directional structure (12) of such a field takes the form\n\u0001s\n\u0001s\n1 s o 1 \u2212 \u03c3R1 R\u0304 1 \u2212 \u03c3R2s R\u0304\ni\n\u0001s\n\u03a52s \u2248 \u01ebo \u03a52s\u2217\n,\n\u03b7\n1 \u2212 \u03c3RR\u0304\n\n(14)\n\nwith the constants R1 and R2s parametrizing the two distinct PNDs. The directional\ndependence of the magnitude of a gravitational type D field and of an algebraically\ngeneral electromagnetic field are thus quite similar. This similarity is even closer\nif we recall that the square of the electromagnetic component \u03a6i2 is proportional\nto the magnitude of the Poynting vector with respect to the interpretation tetrad,\n2\n1\n\u03a6i2 . Indeed, we have\n|Si | \u2248 4\u03c0\n2\n\n\u03a8i4 \u2248\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c3R1 R\u0304 1 \u2212 \u03c3R4 R\u0304\n1\n|\u03a8o4\u2217 |\n2\n|\u03b7|\n1 \u2212 \u03c3RR\u0304\n2\n\n4\u03c0 |Si | \u2248\n\n2\n\u03a6i2\n\n2\n\n,\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c3R2 R\u0304\n1\n2 1 \u2212 \u03c3R1 R\u0304\n\u2248 2 |\u03a6o2\u2217 |\n2\n\u03b7\n1 \u2212 \u03c3RR\u0304\n\n(15)\n2\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nAs discussed in section R.4.5, the form of the directional structure (12) depends\no\non the choice of the normalization factor \u03a52s\u2217\n. Other choices can sometimes be more\no\nconvenient, in particular if the factor \u03a52s\u2217 vanishes which happens when one of the\nPNDs points along the direction lo of the reference tetrad. For the type D fields\nthere exists a more natural 'symmetric' choice of normalization of the directional\nstructure of radiation which is guaranteed to be non-degenerate. For these fields we\ncan define a canonical field component, namely, the only nonvanishing component\nwith respect of the null tetrad associated with the PNDs (13).\nHaving two distinct algebraic directions k1 and k2s we can define algebraically\nspecial null tetrad ks , ls , ms , m\u0304s (and associated orthonormal tetrad ts , qs , rs , ss )\nby requiring that ks , ls are proportional to the PNDs and future oriented, and that\nthe spatial vector ss is tangent to I,\nks \u221d k1 , ls \u221d k2s , ss * n = 0 .\n\n(17)\n\nFor PNDs which are not tangent to the conformal infinity the normalization of null\nvectors ks , ls can be fixed by condition\n\u01eb1 ks * n = \u01eb2s ls * n ,\n6\n\n(18)\nCzech. J. Phys. 55 (2005)\n\n\fAsymptotic directional structure of radiation for algebraically simple fields\n\nwhere \u01eb1 , \u01eb2s = \u00b11 parametrize orientations of the PNDs with respect to I. The\nspecial case of PNDs tangent to I will be discussed below.\nUsing the definition of PNDs (see section R.4.2) we find that the field components with respect to the algebraically special tetrad have very special form - only\nthe component \u03a5ss is nonvanishing (\u03a8s2 for gravitational and \u03a6s1 for electromagnetic\nfields). This component is, in fact, independent of the choice of the spatial vectors\nrs , ss , and thus it does not depend on the normal vector n which we used in the\ndefinition (17). It also does not depend on the normalization (18), provided that\nthe normalization (2) is satisfied. We will use the privileged component \u03a5ss for the\nnormalization of the directional structure of radiation. However, the algebraically\nspecial tetrad is not adjusted to the infinity (cf. condition (3)) since ks and ls are\nnot in general colinear with n and thus it cannot be used as a reference tetrad.\nNevertheless, we can define privileged reference tetrad which is 'somehow aligned'\nwith the algebraically special tetrad, and which shares some of the symmetries of\nthe geometric situation. We will always assume that the reference tetrad satisfies\nthe normalization and adjustment conditions (2), (3), and we set so = ss . This is,\nhowever, still not sufficient to fix the reference tetrad completely. The remaining\nnecessary condition cannot be prescribed in general - we have to discuss separately several possible cases, depending on the character of the infinity I, and on\nthe orientation of the PNDs with respect to I.\nBelow we will define the reference tetrad for all possible cases. We will present\no\nand the canonical component \u03a5ss , which\nthe relation between the component \u03a52s\ncan be substituted into the directional structure (14). Finally, we will rewrite the\nresults in terms of the angular variables introduced with respect to the reference\ntetrad.\n3.1\n\nSpacelike I\n\nWe begin with a spacelike conformal infinity, \u03c3 = \u22121. In this case the two distinct\nfuture oriented algebraically special directions are either both ingoing or both outgoing, and we set the orientation \u01ebo of the reference tetrad accordingly. We define\nthe reference tetrad by conditions\nqo = qs , so = ss , \u01ebo = \u01eb1 = \u01eb2s ,\n\n(19)\n\nand by adjustment condition (4). It follows that the algebraically special directions ks and ls are parametrized with respect to the reference tetrad by a single\nparameter \u03b8s as\n\u0001\nks = \u221a12 cos\u22121 \u03b8s to + cos \u03b8s qo + sin \u03b8s ro ,\n\u0001\n(20)\nls = \u221a12 cos\u22121 \u03b8s to \u2212 cos \u03b8s qo + sin \u03b8s ro .\nThe algebraically special and reference tetrads are thus related by\n\nts = cos\u22121 \u03b8s to + tan \u03b8s ro , qs = qo , rs = cos\u22121 \u03b8s ro + tan \u03b8s to , ss = so ,\n(21)\nCzech.

The vectors ks , ls are aligned with algebraically\nspecial directions (degenerate PNDs), to is normal to infinity I, and qo , ro are tangent\nto I. The relation of both the tetrads is parametrized by the angle \u03b8s between qo and the\nprojection of ks onto I.

In this and the next sections we\nare going to study the special cases when the PNDs are tangent to I. This can\noccur only for timelike or null conformal infinity, the later case will be discussed in\nsection 3.6.\nFirst, we assume that only one of two distinct PNDs, say k2s , is tangent to I. Let\nus note that in such a case we require normalization (18) only for the vector ks \u221d k1 ,\nthe normalization of the other PND ls is fixed by the condition ks * ls = \u22121. We\nuse the PND ks as the vector ko , i.e., we define the reference tetrad by conditions\nko = ks , so = ss , \u01ebo = \u01eb1 ,\n\n(51)\n\ntogether with the condition (4). The algebraically special directions ks and ls are\nthen given in terms of the reference tetrad as\n\u221a\n1\nks = \u221a (to + qo ) , ls = 2 (to + ro ) ,\n2\n\n(52)\n\nsee figure 4(c).

In such a\nsituation there exists no natural normalization of both PNDs analogous to the\ncondition (18) used above. This is related to an ambiguity in a choice of the timelike\nunit vector ts - we can choose any of the (future oriented) unit vectors in the plane\nk1 -k2s . However, despite the fact that we cannot fix the algebraically special tetrad\nuniquely, the nonvanishing component \u03a5ss is independent of this ambiguity: different\nchoices of the special tetrad differ only by a boost in k1 -k2s plane, and \u03a5ss does not\nchange under such a boost. In the following, we arbitrarily choose one particular\nalgebraically special tetrad with respect to which we define the reference tetrad.\nThe reference tetrad thus shares the same ambiguity as the algebraically special\ntetrad.\nThe reference tetrad is fixed simply by conditions\nto = ts ,\n\nso = ss , \u01ebo = \u01eb1 ,\n\n(61)\n\nand (4). PNDs ks and ls are given by\nks =\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n(to + ro ) , ls =\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n(to \u2212 ro ) ,\n\n(62)\n\nso that the algebraically special and reference tetrads are related by\nts = to , qs = ro , rs = \u2212qo , ss = so .\n\n(63)\n\nIt is just a simple spatial rotation by \u03c0/2 in qo -ro plane, as illustrated in figure\n4(d).

It\ncan be easily observed from (12) (cf. section R.5.1 for more detail) that the directional structure of radiation near the null infinity is independent of the direction\nalong which the infinity is approached. The only interesting question is whether the\ndominant field component is vanishing or not - in other words: whether the field\nis radiative or nonradiative. It follows from the definition of PNDs that the normalization factor \u03a5o2s\u2217 in (12) is vanishing if and only if one of the PNDs is tangent\nto I. Thus, the tangency of PNDs to I serves as the geometrical characterization\nof radiative/nonradiative fields.\nLet us first assume that one of the PNDs, say ls , is tangent to I. As in the\nprevious section we cannot fix the normalization of algebraically special tetrad using\nthe condition (18); the algebraically special tetrad cannot be selected uniquely.\nNevertheless, the field component \u03a5ss is still unique. If we choose one algebraically\nspecial tetrad we can use it also as the reference tetrad - it satisfies the adjustment\ncondition (4), cf. figure 6. As mentioned above, the component \u03a5o2s is then vanishing:\ni\n\u03a52s\n\u22480.\n\n(71)\n\nIf both distinct PNDs are not tangent to I we may normalize them by (18) and\nfix the reference tetrad by the condition to = ts , namely,\nto = ts ,\nCzech.

Using (12), \u03c3 = 0, and relation (65) we find that the radiative\ncomponent has no directional structure:\ni\n\u2248 \u01ebso\n\u03a52s\n\n(2s)! s 1\n\u03a5\n.\n(s!)2 s\u2217 \u03b7\n\n(75)\n\nFig. 6.

This involves a generic electromagnetic field (s = 1), the Petrov type D\ngravitational fields (s = 2) having double degenerate principal null directions, and\nother possible fields of an integer spin s which admit a pair of s-degenerate PNDs.\nThe structure of such fields near the conformal infinity depends on the specific\norientation of these algebraically special directions with respect to I, and on the\ncausal character of I. In case of a spacelike conformal infinity (\u039b > 0) there is\nessentially only one possibility which is described in section 3.1, whereas for a\ntimelike conformal infinity (\u039b < 0) four different situations may occur that have to\nbe discussed separately, see sections 3.2\u2013 3.5. For the conformal infinity having a null\ncharacter (\u039b = 0) the asymptotic directional structure disappears: when one of the\n(degenerate) PNDs is tangent to I the radiative component vanishes, otherwise the\nradiation is present and it is independent of the direction along which the infinity\nis approached, cf. section 3.6.\nIn all such cases we have introduced the privileged 'symmetric' reference tetrad\nwhich is naturally adapted to the algebraically special directions and to I. These\nare illustrated in figures 2, 4, and 6. With respect to these reference tetrads it is\npossible to characterize any null direction by standard (pseudo)spherical parameters. The corresponding explicit directional structure of radiation for a spacelike I\nis presented in expression (26), and the four possibilities for a timelike I are given\nby (37), (47), (58), (68).\nThese results generalize our previous study of the asymptotic directional structure of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation in the C-metric spacetimes [1, 2]\nto other fields which are of type D. On the other hand, the expressions presented\nhere are more detailed and more explicit than those given in the review article\n[8]. It would now be an interesting task to apply them on particular exact model\nspacetimes of type D. This may provide a deeper insight into the geometric relation\nbetween the structure of the sources and the properties of radiation generated by\nthem, as observed at spacelike or timelike conformal infinities.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the grant GA\u010cR 202/02/0735.\nCzech.
