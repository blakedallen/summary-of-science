In the previous two papers (Lumsden, Puxley &\nHoare 2001a,b; hereafter Paper 1 and 2) we discussed the\nproperties as measured in planetary nebulae. We showed\nthat the ratio of pure hydrogen and helium recombination\nlines are a good measure of the hardness of the exciting\nradiation field from the central star. This is as expected from\nsimple photoionisation models, since the volume of the He+\nzone relative to the volume of the H+ zone is simply related\nto the hardness of the radiation field in the 504\u2013912\u00c5 region\nof the spectrum of the exciting star. In turn this depends\non the stellar effective temperature as well as more specific\n\ndetails of the stellar spectrum as related to stellar evolution\n(ie stellar winds, luminosity, surface gravity etc). For young\nstars, this ratio is also therefore clearly a constraint on the\nupper end of the stellar initial mass function (IMF).\nThe use of near infrared hydrogen and helium lines\nas probes of the underlying radiation field was suggested\nby Thompson & Tokunaga (1980) in the study of heavily\nembedded compact HII regions. With early infrared instruments the near infrared pure recombination HeI lines were\ntoo weak to be useful. Considerable attention was given instead to the HeI 21 P\u201321 S line at 2.058\u03bcm. Unfortunately\nthis line is largely pumped by the resonance in the HeI 21 P\u2013\n11 S transition, and can be influenced by collisional excitation from the metastable 21 S level as well as from the triplet\nseries. At first it was believed that the complexity of this\n\n\f2\n\nS.L. Lumsden, P.J. Puxley, M.G. Hoare, T.J.T. Moore, N.A. Ridge\n\ntransition could be modelled in a simple fashion. Doyon,\nPuxley & Joseph (1992) suggested that the HeI 21 P\u201321 S to\nHI Br\u03b3 ratio was ideal for studying the initial mass function in starburst galaxies. They tried to take account of\nthe competing factors that led to emission in the 2.058\u03bcm\nline using an analytical approach. However, Shields (1993)\nshowed from a full photoionisation treatment that this approach was a poor approximation to the actual predicted\nline strength. More recent updates to the atomic data used\nin the prediction of the HeI 21 P\u201321 S line strength have also\nbeen presented by Ferland (1999).\n\nIn the previous two papers in this series we were able\nto show that the observed near infrared HeI and HI line\nstrengths did largely follow the predictions of the photoionisation models for planetary nebulae. This is encouraging\nsince the planetary nebulae are at least simple in the sense\nthat the objects we observed only had a single central exciting star, and could be modelled reasonably as expanding\nspheres. If the model predictions for such simple systems deviated significantly from the observations, then the method\nof using near infrared HeI and HI line strengths as a constraint on the hardness of the stellar radiation field would\nhave been invalidated almost completely. The aim of this\npaper is to study how well the line ratios compare between\nmodel and observation for compact HII regions.\n\nHII regions provide a more challenging test of these\nmodels for several reasons. They probably contain a central star cluster rather than a single star, so the cumulative\neffect of the stellar output needs to be estimated. This in\nturn requires knowledge of the IMF. Of course, this is the\nparameter that Doyon et al. (1992) sought to estimate from\nthe HeI to HI line ratios. However, in our case, where we\nare testing the models, we are forced to make some simple\nassumptions regarding the form of the initial mass function.\nCompact HII regions are also rather more diverse morphologically than the simple planetary nebulae we were considering. Finally, there is considerable uncertainty about the\nform of the stellar radiation field in massive stars. Models\ndiverge markedly depending on whether line blanketing due\nto metals is included or not, whether the effects of a stellar wind are included, and whether a non-LTE treatment\nis applied. Martins, Schaerer & Hillier (2002) give a useful\nsummary of the properties of the currently available models for dwarfs. In addition to this overall uncertainty, there\nis also some doubt as to whether very young massive stars\nhave the same effective radiation field as they would if they\nwere on the main sequence. We know that massive young\nstellar objects tend to have very dense, slow moving, stellar\nwinds (eg. Bunn, Drew & Hoare 1995). These winds may reprocess much of the ionising radiation from the young stars\ninto non-ionising radiation. The objects studied by Bunn et\nal. do not have substantial HII regions despite having the\nbolometric luminosity equivalent to OB stars. The aim of\nthis paper therefore is to determine how well we can reproduce the HeI/HI line ratios used in Papers 1 and 2 using\nrealistic models of compact HII regions.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nTHE OBSERVATIONAL SAMPLE\nNear infrared spectroscopy\n\nAll of our target HII regions are drawn from the compilation\nof ultracompact HII regions presented by Wood & Churchwell (1989) and Kurtz, Churchwell & Wood (1994). The objects were chosen to be sufficiently bright in the near infrared\nto allow high signal-to-noise low resolution spectroscopy to\nbe obtained. The sources have a variety of morphologies, at\nleast as seen in the radio continuum images.\nThe line ratios presented in this paper were taken from\nspectroscopic data acquired for other purposes. Most of the\ndata were obtained using the facility near infrared spectrograph CGS4 at the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope.\nThe high spectral resolution data from which we draw the\n2.16475\u03bcm HeI 73,1 G\u201343,1 F/HI Br\u03b3 line ratio comes from a\nproject to map the kinematics of compact HII regions (eg.\nLumsden & Hoare 1996, 1999). The original data have a\nspectral resolution of \u223c 20000, sufficient to easily distinguish the satellite HeI lines from Br\u03b3 itself. Full details of\nthe observations and data reduction can be found in the\ncited papers.\nThe lower resolution data comes from a project to study\nthe near infrared extinction law (Ridge et al. in preparation). Here observations of the 1.6\u20132.2\u03bcm region were acquired at low spectral resolution (R \u223c400). All of the data\nwere acquired with CGS4 with the exception of that for\nG45.45+0.06, where we have used data acquired with the\nnear infrared imager/spectrograph IRIS on the AAT. The\nraw data were processed, corrected for atmospheric absorption and flux calibrated in the usual fashion (see, eg, Paper\n2 which discusses data acquired on planetary nebulae using\nCGS4, or Lumsden & Puxley 1996 which deals with similar\nIRIS data). We measured the fluxes of the HI Br series lines,\nin order to determine the extinction, as well as 2.058\u03bcm HeI\n21 P\u201321 S and 1.7007\u03bcm HeI 43 D\u201333 P from the low resolution\ndata. Unfortunately, the H band data for G45.07+0.13 are\nof insufficient signal-to-noise to detect the HI Br12 or HeI\n43 D\u201333 P lines. The limits that can be placed are consistent\nwith other data for this object, without actually adding any\nextra constraints.\nFor both high and low resolution data, we measured\nthe line fluxes from the spectrum summed over the whole\nobject. There was no evidence for a variation in line ratio\nalong the slit in any of our sources. Since we are only interested in line ratios with HI Br\u03b3, we have combined the\nlow and high resolution data in our analysis. The line ratios\nfrom the high resolution data are not corrected for extinction. The small wavelength range involved implies a correction of less than 1% for all our sources. The low resolution\ndata were corrected by comparing the HI lines of Br\u03b3, Br10,\nBr11 and Br12 (the latter 3 lines lie at 1.737\u03bcm, 1.681\u03bcm\nand 1.644\u03bcm). These line ratios vary by less than 5% over\nthe expected range of electron temperatures and densities\n(eg Wood & Churchwell 1989). We assumed a power law\ndependence for the extinction so that \u03c4 \u221d \u03bb\u22121.85 (Landini\net al. 1984). The error in the HeI 1.7007\u03bcm/HI Br\u03b3 ratio\nis then largely set by the derived error in this extinction\ncorrection.\nThe HeI 21 P\u201321 S line must also be corrected for a high\nfrequency component in the atmospheric absorption that is\nnot removed by standard techniques (see Paper 1 for full\n\n\fHelium and Hydrogen Line Ratios and The Stellar Content of Compact HII Regions\ndetails). The adopted correction values are given to allow the\nraw line ratios to be estimated. Table 1 presents these values,\nall the observed line ratios after correction for extinction and\nthe adopted values of \u03c4Br\u03b3 .\nFinally we also use data on the HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio previously published by Doherty et al. (1994) for G5.97\u2013\n1.17 and G43.89\u20130.78. The extinction corrections applied\nthere are derived from a comparison of radio continuum and\nBr\u03b3 flux density. We give the values as taken from the original source.\n2.2\n\nRadio and Far Infrared Data\n\nWe used the data given in Wood & Churchwell (1989) and\nKurtz et al. (1994) in order to constrain the IMF for the\nexciting stars in these sources. Table 2 gives the basic observational properties of our sample. The radio data gives a\nmeasure of the flux of hydrogen ionising photons, whereas\nIRAS data gives a measure of the total luminosity. The comparison of radio and far infrared data therefore gives us information as to whether the exciting source in an HII region\nis a single star or a cluster of stars since the two observable properties depend on stellar mass (and the IMF) in a\nslightly different way (see Section 3.2).\nThe radio data actually provides a lower limit to the flux\nof hydrogen ionising photons. The interferometric data presented in Wood & Churchwell and Kurtz et al. are not sensitive to emission on scales much larger than 10\u201330 arcseconds. Therefore such extended flux is missed. This is clearly\ntrue for G19.61\u20130.23A where we have instead used the fluxes\npresented by Garay et al. (1998). Kurtz et al. (1999) demonstrate that such extended emission is commonplace in compact HII regions. Such 'compact' HII regions tend to show\na compact dense core, which is what was detected by Wood\n& Churchwell (1989) and Kurtz et al. (1994), surrounded by\nlow density extended ionised gas emission. We also do not\ncorrect for any dust present in the HII region, which also\nacts to depress the derived flux of hydrogen ionising photons.\nThe work of Hoare, Roche & Glencross (1991) suggests this\nis a reasonable approximation. Finally we note that we have\nused the distance estimates given by Wood & Churchwell\n(1989) and Kurtz et al. (1994). There is evidence that these\nare on average too large (see, eg, Araya et al. 2002, which\ngives distances for six of our targets). However, the effect\nof a slightly too large distance more or less compensates for\nany missing radio emission, so the actual net effect is small\nwhen considering the radio data.\nBy contrast with the radio data, the observed IRAS\nfluxes may well be too large, since the large IRAS beam\ncan encompass emission from neighbouring sources given\nthe high source density in the Galactic plane. Inspection of\nhigher (18\u2032\u2032 ) resolution 21\u03bcm images from the MSX satellite mission (see, eg, Price et al 2001 for details of this mission) clearly shows the source multiplicity within the IRAS\nbeam in many cases. The most discrepant are G5.89\u20130.39,\nG19.61\u20130.23A, G35.20\u20131.74 and G45.07+0.13, where the observed MSX 21\u03bcm flux densities are only 53%, 65%, 63% and\n65% respectively of the IRAS 25\u03bcm flux density. In addition,\nW51d is only a small part of the W51 HII region (and merges\nwith other sources even in the MSX beam). Therefore, under the assumption that most of the bolometric luminosity\nis reprocessed by dust, the far infrared luminosity as seen by\n\n3\n\nIRAS gives an upper limit to the true bolometric luminosity.\nIn addition, the likely overestimate in the distances should\nbe borne in mind since this also inflates the estimated IRAS\nluminosity (by a factor of \u223c 2 typically if the distances in\nAraya et al. 2002 are correct).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nHII REGION MODELS\nStellar Models\n\nAny photoionisation model of a HII region requires some\nassumption as to the form of the spectral energy distribution of the exciting star(s). We used the CoStar model stellar atmospheres as our main input (Schaerer et al. 1996a,b).\nThese have the advantage of being widely available and used\nin such photoionisation modelling, and therefore provide\na benchmark against which we can test the observations.\nThe CoStar models were placed on a physical luminosityeffective temperature scale by Schaerer & de Koter (1997)\nusing the calibrations of Vacca, Garmany & Shull (1996)\nwho presented the fundamental relations between observational properties of O stars. We used the predicted values\nfor NLyC from Schaerer & de Koter to normalise our model\nset.\nThe Vacca et al. calibration may be inaccurate however\n(see, eg, the discussion in Herrero 2003, Martins, Schaerer &\nHillier 2002, or Smith, Norris & Crowther 2002). The Vacca\net al. calibration relied on results from pure hydrogen and\nhelium non-LTE models and is likely to overestimate the\neffective temperature for a given spectral type by as much\nas 10\u201315% (see, eg, Herrero 2003 for an overview). Martins\net al. (2002) show the likely effect for the models of most\ninterest to us, the dwarfs, with the effective temperature\nbeing too hot by at least 1500K for all O types. Crowther et\nal. (2002) and Herrero (2003) show that the same effect holds\nfor supergiants as well. There is also observational evidence\nthat the assumed absolute V band magnitude (and hence\nluminosity) derived by Vacca et al. is overestimated slightly\nfor the hotter dwarfs (compare Figure 1 in Smith et al. 2002\nwith Figure 6 in Vacca et al).\nIn order to estimate the extent of the effect that the use\nof the CoStar grid and the Vacca et al. calibration has on\nour results we also used data from a smaller grid of models presented by Smith et al. (2002). These are based on the\nWM-basic models of Pauldrach, Hoffmann & Lennon (2001),\nbut use the Smith et al. luminosity calibration. We adopted\nthese models since they span the range of effective temperature we are interested in as well as being readily available,\nthough other similar models are now available (see, eg, Herrero 2003 for a summary). Smith et al. (2002) show that the\nhard ultraviolet flux in the CoStar models is enhanced compared to the WM-basic models (eg see their Figure 4). This\nis likely due to a fuller treatment of the line blanketing in\nthe WM-basic models (see also the discussion in Section 4.2\nof Giveon et al. 2002 regarding the comparison of WM-basic\nmodels with simple LTE models).\nWe have also included an extension to the effective temperature sequence for stars with masses <\n20 M\u2299 . These are\n\u223c\ntaken from Puxley (1988) and approximate the behaviour of\nlower mass stars. The stellar atmospheres used in these models are the LTE models from Kurucz (1979). These models\n\n\f4\n\nS.L. Lumsden, P.J. Puxley, M.G. Hoare, T.J.T. Moore, N.A. Ridge\n\nare known to be incorrect to within a factor of a few. Therefore we only use these models to demonstrate why we can\nlargely ignore the lower mass stars in our analysis, and do\nnot use them in any detailed photoionisation modelling.\n\n3.2\n\nObservable Properties\n\nIf there is a cluster present, then we need to know the form of\nthe stellar IMF before we can compare models with observations. Scalo (1998) reviews our current understanding of the\nIMF in depth. For our purposes however we adopted the relatively simple IMF proposed by Salpeter (1955), where the\nIMF is described solely by a power law,\n\u03c8(M ) \u221d M \u22122.35 .\nThis is sufficiently close to our present knowledge of the\nupper end of the IMF that it is still a reasonable approximation. The fact that it is a poor approximation to the lower\nend of the IMF is unimportant because the steepness of the\ndependence of the ionising photon flux on stellar mass means\nwe need only consider massive stars in any event. The number of hydrogen ionising photons for a given stellar cluster\nis then\nNLyC =\n\nZ\n\nnLyC (M )\u03c8(M )dM\n\nwhere nLyC is the number of hydrogen ionising photons at\na given stellar mass. A similar relation holds for the total\nluminosity, Ltot .\nFigure 1 shows how the combinations nLyC (M )\u03c8(M )\nand L(M )\u03c8(M ) behave as a function of stellar mass for the\nCoStar models. This clearly demonstrates why we can use\nthe comparison of IRAS and radio data to constrain the form\nof the IMF. The former has a much steeper dependence on\nM than the latter, so that Ltot is much more sensitive to\nthe presence of lower mass stars. Although the details of\nthe functional form differ slightly, the same is true for the\nWM-basic models presented in Smith et al. (2002) as well.\nIn Figure 2 we plot the actual comparison of NLyC and\nLtot for our sample. The lower solid curve represents the\ntrack followed by a single star of increasing mass. The points\nmarked are for (a) the dwarf CoStar models listed in Table\n3 of Schaerer & de Koter (1997) and (b) the hottest 9 dwarf\nmodels listed in Table 1 of Smith et al. (2002). The upper curve presents the track of a stellar cluster. The points\nmarked here represent the same spectral types as for the single stars, but here these are the most massive stars present\nin the cluster. We have normalised these curves so that there\nis exactly one star with that spectral type. Other possible\ncombinations such as a steeper IMF (as perhaps indicated\nby the review of Scalo), or a truncated IMF at both upper and lower mass limits lie somewhere between the two\ncurves shown. The WM-basic models presented by Smith et\nal. (2002), using their luminosity calibration, largely overlie\nthe tracks shown for the CoStar models, but with the points\noffset approximately 1.5 sub-types towards lower luminosity\nthan the CoStar models.\nWe have also plotted the direction in which the observational errors described in Section 2.2 move the observed\nluminosity and NLyC points in Figure 2. The plotted tracks\nshow the effect of a decrease in the bolometric luminosity\n\nby a factor of two (the extreme suggested by the comparison of the IRAS and MSX data above), an increase in NLyC\nby a factor of three (roughly the case presented by the example of G19.61\u20130.34A), and a decrease in distance by a\nfactor of two as suggested by Araya et al. (2002). The distance errors move the observed data approximately parallel\nwith the model tracks, so any large discrepancy between the\nobserved data and the models is unlikely to be due to this\nsource. Most of the observed data cluster around or above\neither the cluster line or single star line in Figure 2. Errors\nof the magnitude shown are certainly sufficient to move all\nof the sources onto either cluster or single star tracks.\nWe have estimated two characteristic effective temperatures for each of our sources for both CoStar and WMbasic stellar models. These are estimated simply by locating\nthe nearest model that lies directly below the observed data\npoint. We have not interpolated these temperatures. The results are given in Table 2. The first value given in Table 2\nis that for the single star required to match the radio data.\nThe second is the hottest star in the cluster that provides a\nbest match to the observed radio and far infrared data. Since\nnone of the errors move the objects from significantly below\nthe cluster track to above it, we assume that sources below\nthe cluster track are powered by single stars only. For these\ncases therefore we do not give a type for the most massive\nstar in a cluster. The likely observational errors imply that\na given source may actually be up to two sub-types hotter\nthan this and as many as five sub-types cooler.\nNote that although the CoStar and WM-basic model\nsequences in Figure 2 do not overlie each other in terms of\nthe actual O sub-type, the same effective temperatures tend\nto lie in the same place in these diagrams. This explains\nthe rough equivalence between the temperatures of the two\nmodel sets given in Table 2. Any differences are likely due to\nthe coarseness of the model grids, especially for the Smith\net al. models. In the actual plots of the observed data we\ntherefore use only the effective temperatures derived from\nthe CoStar models because the sampling is better.\n3.3\n\nPhotoionisation Models\n\nWe used Cloudy version 94.0 (Ferland 2000) to calculate the\nemission line properties for our model HII regions. We ran\na grid of models covering the full range of available stellar\neffective temperature (Tef f ) for the CoStar model grid, for\nall three luminosity classes. Although we are interested in\nyoung massive stars, there have been suggestions previously\nthat supergiant models are actually a better match to the\nobservational data. This is probably in line with the known\nproperties of some massive young stellar objects, since there\nis evidence that their spectra bear a resemblance to hypergiants (eg Hamann & Persson 1989). In addition, we also\nran a smaller set of dwarf and supergiant models using the\nWM-basic set from Smith et al. (2002).\nWe adopt a 'standard' model where we compare the\ndifferent stellar inputs, with a flat electron density of ne =\n6000cm\u22123 , a turbulent velocity of 5kms\u22121 , inner and outer\nradii to the nebulae of 0.01 pc and 0.5 pc respectively (see\nbelow) and input stellar models appropriate to solar metallicity. Where we vary a given parameter, we kept the other\nparameters fixed at the values for this standard unless otherwise noted. We assume throughout that the helium abun-\n\n\fHelium and Hydrogen Line Ratios and The Stellar Content of Compact HII Regions\ndance is 10% by number when computing the models, but\nallow the metal abundance to vary in line with the stellar\nmodel for the WM-basic model set.\nWe also varied three other physical parameters in the\nmodels we considered in order to determine which factors\nwere important in influencing the HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio. These were the electron density (and density structure),\nthe turbulent velocity within the ionised gas and the metallicity of the exciting star. We used the the CoStar model\nset when considering the effect of density and the microscopic velocity field, and the WM-basic set when considering\nmetallicity. The first two parameters are independent of the\nnature of the stellar model, whilst only the WM-basic model\nset spans sufficient metallicity range to be worth considering.\nWe constructed models spanning all five of the metallicities\nconsidered by Smith et al. (2002).\nWe considered a range of turbulent velocities, from 0 to\n15kms\u22121 . The HeI 21 P\u201321 S line is expected to be sensitive to\nlocal velocity broadening (hence turbulence) because of the\nresonance pumping from the 21 P\u201311 S transition (see Paper\n1 for more details). The range chosen matches the typical\nrange seen in compact HII regions. For the WM-basic models\nwe only used a value of 5kms\u22121 throughout.\nWe considered two possible density models for the HII\nregions in the CoStar models: a flat constant density model,\nwith ne varying between 1000 and 50000cm\u22123 , and a model\nwith a flat baseline density ne = 1000cm\u22123 with a superposed radial Gaussian density profile, with peak density\nagain varying up to 50000cm\u22123 . In both cases the inner surface of the cloud was 0.01 pc from the exciting source, and a\nnominal 0.5 pc outer radius was adopted. The latter matched\nthe observed radii of our sources to within a factor of a few\nin all cases, though the actual model results are relatively\ninsensitive to this parameter. We adopted a full width at\nhalf maximum of 0.3 pc for the Gaussian component. The\nradii were the same in the WM-basic models, but we only\nconsidered the flat density law with ne = 6000cm\u22123 .\nWe also considered two sets of models with a larger\ninner radius. In the first, we set the inner radius to the cloud\nfrom the exciting star of 0.3 pc, but otherwise used the same\nset of parameters as the flat density models. This radius is\nactually larger than the total size of many of the objects\nbeing considered, and so this is not a realistic physical model\nof these sources. It can be thought of as a crude way to\napproximate the effect of using stellar models with a lower\nionisation parameter since the net effect is to reduce the\nionising flux at the HII region. We define this parameter as\nthe dimensionless ratio of the photon flux to the hydrogen\ndensity at the inner surface of the HII region (note, not the\nStromgren radius as in the usual definition: our definition\nagrees with that used in Cloudy), so that\nU=\n\nNLyC\n,\n4\u03c0 r 2 nH c\n\nwhere r is the inner radius of the HII region, and nH the total\nhydrogen density. Trials showed that we had to increase this\nradius to \u223c 0.3 pc before an effect was seen in the results\n(models with inner radius of 0.1 pc are similar to the models\nwith inner radius of 0.01 pc). This corresponds to a drop\nof \u223c 1000 in the ionisation parameter. The outer radius\nfor these models was increased to 2 pc. The second large\ninner radius set we considered used CoStar models with an\n\n5\n\ninner radius of 1 pc and an outer radius of 5 pc. This model\nassumed a flat electron density profile, and only a model\nwith ne = 50000cm\u22123 and turbulent velocity of 5kms\u22121 was\ncalculated.\n3.4\n\nModel Results\n\nFigure 3 and 4 show the results from our Cloudy simulations for the different sets of stellar inputs (luminosity class\nand model type) for the key HeI 21 P\u201321 S (Figure 3) and HeI\n43 D\u201333 P (Figure 4) to HI Br\u03b3 line ratios. In both Figure 3(a)\nand 4(a) the results are presented for our standard model\nfor dwarf, giant and supergiant CoStar model atmospheres,\nand for dwarf and supergiant WM-basic model atmospheres.\nThe sampling of the WM-basic models is coarser than for\nthe CoStar models which may partly explain the shift in\nthe peak between the CoStar and WM-basic dwarf models.\nThe CoStar models as a whole show greater variance with\ntype than the WM-basic models for both line ratios however.\nAs noted in Section 3.1 this is probably a reflection of the\nfact that the CoStar models have insufficient line blanketing,\nwhich is of greater importance in stars with larger mass loss\nrate (eg supergiants as opposed to dwarfs). The net result\nis a spectrum that is 'harder' at a given effective temperature than it should be, particularly in the far ultraviolet.\nBy comparison, the dwarf and supergiant WM-basic models give very similar predictions (identical in Figure 4(a), so\nonly the dwarf models are actually plotted).\nIn Figures 3(b) and 4(b) we consider the effect of having a cluster of stars rather than a single star. We again\nused the standard model and the CoStar dwarf model atmospheres. The cluster was constructed so that one star with\nthe spectral type of the maximum effective temperature was\npresent, and the normalisation for the other stars was then\nset by matching the observed NLyC and L for a cluster as\nin Figure 2. There is clearly little difference in the HeI/HI\nratios between the single-star and the cluster case. This is\nin line with Figure 1, which clearly shows that the number of helium ionising photons drops sharply as the stellar\nmass decreases below 40 M\u2299 (equivalent to Tef f <\n42000K\n\u223c\nfor the CoStar dwarf models). These results suggest a prior\nunderstanding of the IMF is not required in order to place\na constraint on the hottest star present using these ratios.\nIn Figure 5 we show the results from our standard model\nfor a different line ratio to show that large differences do exist between the dwarf and supergiant Cloudy models and the\nWM-basic models. The line ratio plotted is that of 15.6\u03bcm\n[NeIII] with 12.8\u03bcm [NeII]. This ratio is commonly obtained\nfrom spectroscopy obtained by the ISO satellite of compact\nHII regions (eg Morisset et al. 2002, Giveon et al. 2002).\nThese model results clearly show much wider variation in\nbehaviour than any of the HeI/HI line ratios. We have also\nshown how metallicity can effect such line ratios as well by\nexamining the variation with metallicity for the WM-basic\ndwarf models. The result is largely as expected if higher\nmetallicity leads to more line blanketing in the far ultraviolet, and hence a softening of the spectral energy distribution\n(the difference occurs at energies larger than 2.5 Rydberg,\ndue to the change in the species causing the line blanketing: see the extended discussion of this issue in Giveon et\nal. 2002 for fuller details). These results highlight both a\nstrength and weakness of the HeI/HI ratios in placing con-\n\n\f6\n\nS.L. Lumsden, P.J. Puxley, M.G. Hoare, T.J.T. Moore, N.A. Ridge\n\nstraints on the effective temperatures of the stars present.\nThe main strength is that the results you would obtain are\nlargely independent of the stellar model chosen and metallicity (since the helium fraction alters with metallicity by\na much smaller amount than any of the metals). The main\nweakness is that it can place only weak constraints on the\nspectral energy distribution of the stellar atmosphere itself.\nFigure 6 shows how the metallicity of the underlying\nstar effects the results. Again we show both the HeI 21 P\u2013\n21 S (a) and HeI 43 D\u201333 P (b) to HI Br\u03b3 line ratios. There\nis a weak metallicity dependence in the former, probably\nas a result of the increase of the neutral helium fraction in\nthe nebula due to the softening of the ultraviolet flux with\nincreasing metallicity. The resonance of the 21 P\u201311 S transition is crucially dependent on this neutral helium fraction\nas first noted by Shields (1993). By contrast the changes are\nrelatively small in the pure recombination line ratio.\nFigure 7 shows how the ratio varies as a function of\nthe turbulent velocity. Increasing the turbulent velocity depresses the ratio, as was seen for the models for the PN\npresented in Paper 1. This is simply due to the fact that the\nresonance scattering of the 21 P\u201311 S HeI line is more likely\nto lead to capture by dust or atomic hydrogen if the line is\nmuch broader than the thermal value. The differences seen\nare of the same order of magnitude here as in Paper 1, as\nexpected given that this is a test of the physics in Cloudy\nand not really of the form of the input stellar models.\nFigure 8 shows the effect on the HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3\nratio of changing the electron density (the pure recombination line ratio is independent of density). Figure 8(a) shows\nthe data for a flat density distribution, and Figure 8(b) the\ndata for the Gaussian density distribution. There is clearly\nlittle difference between the two, and little apparent dependence on density. This is perhaps surprising since it is well\nknown that the 21 S level of helium can be pumped by collisional excitation from the triplet 23 S 'ground-state' (see,\neg, Doherty et al. 1994). In practice these Cloudy models\npredict the 23 S level is primarily depopulated by photoionisation instead (see also the discussion in Clegg & Harrington\n1989) however.\nFigure 9 shows the results for a flat model with a larger\ninner nebular radius. The solid lines show the result of increasing the radius to 0.3 pc, with the same densities as\nthose shown in Figure 8(a), whilst the dashed line shows\nthe result for an inner radius of 1 pc for a single electron\ndensity. It must be stressed that these models should only\nbe appropriate for older more extended HII regions. However, it is clear that a reduction in the ionisation parameter\nat the inner edge of the nebula does have a striking effect\non the line ratio. The most obvious feature is the enhanced\ndensity dependence of the HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio, clearly\nindicating the growing importance of collisional excitation\nof the 21 S level. This is a reflection of the much higher ultraviolet photon density at the inner surface of the HII region\nin our other models. The effect seen in the models with a\nlarger inner radius should in principle be seen in our 'normal' models if we increased the density significantly beyond\n105 cm\u22123 since the collisional rate may then dominate the\nphotoionisation rate. Such densities are not in agreement\nwith the published estimates from radio data however. It is\nalso worth noting the fact that the very extended HII re-\n\ngion model shows a much shallower decline of the HeI 21 P\u2013\n21 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio with increasing effective temperature.\nThe overall trends seen in the models can be summarised fairly simply. There are weak variations in the HeI\n21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio with almost all the parameters considered, but only the increase of the inner radius combined\nwith changes in the electron density have a significant impact. By contrast, the pure recombination line ratios are\nlargely independent of most of the factors we have considered.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nOBSERVATIONAL RESULTS\nGeneral Trends\n\nFigure 10 shows the observed HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio together with a representative sample of the CoStar models\nfrom Section 3. We have not plotted the WM-basic model\nhere since it is very close in appearance to the CoStar dwarf\nmodel (Figure 3). The behaviour seen is almost completely\nat variance with the models. One of the two lowest temperature sources plotted here (G5.97\u20131.17) lie well above\nthe predicted curve. The nature of this source is not entirely\nclear, since it lies very near the exciting star of M8, Herschel\n36. Stecklum et al. (1998) have speculated that the emission\nactually arises in material near a young, but much less massive, star which is being photo-evaporated by the radiation\nof Herschel 36. If true, the actual effective temperature of\nthe exciting star is that of Herschel 36 (an O7V star), and\nthe point should be shifted to higher Tef f on the figure. The\nother key point to note from Figure 10 is that the observed\nratio at Tef f > 40000K is always higher than the theoretical\nprediction unless we adopt the lowest ionisation parameter\nmodel. There is also no downturn in the observed ratio as\nTef f increases beyond 40000K, as predicted in all the models. It must be noted however that the largest inner radius\nmodel declines more slowly than the others and is hence a\nbetter, though still poor, match to the data.\nThe 'pure' recombination line ratios are shown in Figure 11. We have also shown a representative spread of the\nstellar models in Figures 11(a) and (b), with dwarf CoStar\nmodels in (a) and dwarf WM-basic models in (b). Since the\n73,1 G\u201343,1 F/43 D\u201333 P ratio is effectively constant, the WMbasic model for (a) would look the same as in (b) but with\nthe plateau value the same as for the CoStar models (and\nvice-versa for the CoStar models not shown in (b)). The\nlow ionisation parameter/large inner radius models shown\nin Figure 10 are not shown in Figure 11 since they given\nessentially the same results as the dwarf models plotted.\nIn general, these models agree reasonably well with the\ndwarf models at Tef f > 38000K. There is some discrepancy\nbetween dwarf models and observation at lower effective\ntemperature. Again, in part, this is due to G5.97\u20131.17. There\nis some evidence from the data however that the 'plateau' in\nthese ratios arrives at a slightly cooler effective temperature\nthan the models predict, though the difference is certainly\nwithin the errors on the adopted object effective temperatures given in Table 2. The other truly discrepant point\nis that for G5.89\u20130.39, which lies well below the predicted\nmodel curve for the HeI 73,1 G\u201343,1 F/HI Br\u03b3 ratio. It may\nalso lie below the model HeI 43 D\u201333 P/HI Br\u03b3 ratio but the\n\n\fHelium and Hydrogen Line Ratios and The Stellar Content of Compact HII Regions\nobservational error for this ratio is too large to draw any\nconclusions. We discuss this source in more detail below.\nOverall, however, our results are in accord with the study of\na large sample of optically visible, and hence more evolved\nHII regions, by Kennicutt et al. (2000). They found that the\nratio of optical HeI and HI lines were in general agreement\nwith the predictions from Cloudy using main sequence models for the exciting stars. Our results tend to indicate that\nthe same is true regardless of the stellar model used.\nIt is worth briefly considering whether the data might\nmatch one of the CoStar supergiant models shown in Figures 3 and 4. There have been suggestions that such models\nsometimes give a better match between theory and observations to other line ratios in compact HII regions (see Section\n4.2 below for an example). Note from Figures 3 and 4 there\nis no difference between dwarf and supergiant WM-basic\nmodels, so we do not consider these here. Of course the observational data as plotted in Figure 10 and 11 assume the\nexciting stars have effective temperatures compatible with\nthe CoStar dwarf models. In practice, if we define the spectral type using CoStar supergiant models in the same fashion\nas Figure 2, then all of the sources fitted by a single exciting star actually lie well below the end of the CoStar model\nsequence. The others have types ranging from O7I/O8.5I\ndownwards depending on whether a single star model or a\ncluster is used. Therefore the observational data should all\nbe shifted to the left by \u223c 10000K when comparing the observational data in Figures 10 and 11 with the supergiant\nmodels in Figures 3 and 4. This clearly makes most of the\nobservational data disagree completely with the model. The\nproblem is actually exacerbated if we consider a cluster of\nexciting stars. It seems clear that supergiant CoStar models\nare not a sensible match to the HeI/HI line ratio data in\ngeneral.\nFigure 12 shows the ratio of the HeI 21 P\u201321 S line with\nthe two 'pure' HeI recombination lines. We showed in Paper 2 that this ratio helped remove any abundance effects\nwhen comparing observational data with the predictions\nfrom Cloudy assuming a single helium abundance. The data\nhere however are actually more consistent with a flat line\nthan the predicted curves. The results therefore show that\nthe cause of the high HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio is not an\nabundance effect, but is intrinsic to the strength of the\nHeI 21 P\u201321 S line. Even the model with a 1 pc inner radius and high electron density fails to explain the observed\ndata. These results are completely different from those for\nthe planetary nebulae, where these HeI/HeI ratios generally\nshowed reasonable agreement between model and observation.\nWe must stress however that these HII regions have\nelectron densities that are generally a factor of \u223c10 higher\nthan in the planetary nebulae. It is worth noting that there\nis a small discrepancy between the observed and model HeI\n21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 line ratio even in the planetary nebulae\n(see Figure 4 and 5 of Paper 2), in the sense that the HeI\n21 P\u201321 S line is stronger than expected by 10\u201320% from the\nmean model trend. As noted above, we expect the HeI 21 P\u2013\n21 S to be stronger if the collisional excitation rate from 23 S\nexceeds the photoionisation rate. If the Cloudy estimation\nof these two rates is inaccurate (or equally if our assumed\nmodel inputs for inner cloud radius and electron density are\ntoo small), then it is possible that the collisional excitation\n\n7\n\nrate actually dominates in these compact HII regions in reality. However, even allowing for this, it is notable that the\nHeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 line ratio does still decrease at higher\neffective temperatures for the planetary nebulae, and we do\nnot see that effect here. It seems clear that at least one other\nfactor must play a role in explaining the poor match between\nmodel and observed HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 line ratios for the\ncompact HII regions.\nThe most important caveat in these general conclusions\nis that we rely on the data shown in Figure 2 to derive Tef f .\nWe have used the data as presented in Wood & Churchwell\n(1989) and Kurtz et al. (1994). As noted in Section 2, there\nare reasons for believing that at least some of the distance\nestimates they use are too large. A lower distance estimate\nmay help to explain some of the problem for those sources\nin Figure 10 which lie at Tef f > 40000K, but which lie\nwell above the model HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio, since it\nwould move the observed points to lower Tef f . However, it\ncannot be too much lower, since Figure 11 shows reasonable\nagreement between model and data.\n4.2\n\nIndividual Sources: G29.96\u20130.02\n\nThere are several parameters that we have not discussed so\nfar that may affect our conclusions. These are best illustrated by considering specific examples. A useful example\nis G29.96\u20130.02. This object has been discussed at length in\nthe literature. There are good arguments for believing that it\nmay be at a distance of 6 kpc rather than the 9 kpc given in\nWood & Churchwell (1989), or even the 7.4 kpc estimated\nby Churchwell, Walmsley & Cesaroni (1990) (see Pratap,\nMegeath & Bergin 1999 for a fuller discussion regarding the\ndistance to this object). G29.96\u20130.02 is more extended in the\nradio than indicated by the radio map of Wood & Churchwell (1989). Fey et al. (1995) derive a value of NLyC which is\n\u223c50% higher than Wood & Churchwell, largely compensating for any reduction in distance with regard to this indicator\n(see also the discussion in Section 2.2). Using the Fey et al.\ndata and a distance of 6 kpc log NLyC = 49.1s\u22121 . The bolometric luminosity however does decrease to log L = 5.95 L\u2299 .\nThe net results is a drop of half a sub-type in the best fitting\nstellar dwarf models, with a cluster still being preferred over\na single star (see Figure 2). The expected pure HeI/HI recombination line ratio for such a model is still on the plateau\nseen at high Tef f in Figure 11, in agreement with observation.\nThere have been many previous indirect estimates of\nthe spectral type of the exciting star(s) in this HII region,\nin the same spirit as this paper but primarily using midinfrared forbidden line data. The most recent of these by\nMorisset et al. (2002), based on ISO data, concluded that\nthe best matched exciting star was actually a relatively cool\nsupergiant (\u223cO9.5I, or Tef f \u223c 30000K using CoStar models). This actually disagrees with our pure recombination\nline ratios (Figure 11, and see the discussion in Section 4.1),\nand hence we can rule that model out. Such a model can\nalso probably be ruled out on the basis of other evidence.\nThe presence of young hot cores (eg. Cesaroni et al. 1998, De\nBuizer et al. 2002) near the HII region strongly suggest that\nG29.96\u20130.02 is part of a complex of star formation taking\nplace on a larger scale (also consistent with the complexity\nseen on larger scales at radio wavelengths by Kim & Koo\n\n\f8\n\nS.L. Lumsden, P.J. Puxley, M.G. Hoare, T.J.T. Moore, N.A. Ridge\n\n2001). Furthermore our own work on the kinematics of this\nobject (Lumsden and Hoare 1996, 1999) indicate an evolved\nstar travelling through a molecular cloud is not a good match\nto the data.\nIt is worth briefly considering why Morisset et al.\nreached the conclusion they did. There are several line ratios\nin the mid and far-infrared that are abundance independent.\nThese include, limiting ourselves to the better studied midinfrared ratios only, 6.99\u03bcm [ArII]/8.99\u03bcm [ArIII], 18.7\u03bcm\n[SIII]/10.5\u03bcm [SIV], and 12.8\u03bcm [NeII]/15.6\u03bcm [NeIII]. The\nlatter two are of particular interest since S++ and Ne+ have\napproximately the same ionisation potential as He0 . Therefore, in principle, these ratios add extra constraints on the\nform of the stellar spectral energy distribution beyond 504\u00c5.\nHere we will only consider the 12.8\u03bcm [NeII]/15.6\u03bcm [NeIII]\nratio in detail. Morisset et al. give an extinction corrected\nobserved ratio of 3.75\u00b10.3 (the observed ratio is close to 2).\nAs can be seen from the inspection of Figures 4 and 5 a ratio\nthis low, together with the observed HeI/HI ratio actually\nrules out all CoStar models. Morisset et al. adopted a low\nvalue for the HeI/HI ratio, based on weak helium radio recombination line data from Kim and Koo (2001), allowing\na fit to the data with cool CoStar supergiant models. Our\nresult is certainly more reliable, and hence we can exclude\nthis model as previously noted.\nIndeed, it is not just G29.96\u20130.02 where the combination of our near infrared data and published mid-infrared\ndata leads to problems for the CoStar models. If we accept\nthe best matching CoStar models to the mid-infrared data\nall of G5.89\u20130.39, G29.96\u20130.02, G43.89\u20130.78, G45.07+0.13,\nG45.12+0.13, G45.45+0.06 and W51d would have temperatures inconsistent with the HeI/HI ratios presented in Figure\n11 (see the ISO data presented in Giveon et al., or the IRAS\nLRS data in Simpson & Rubin 1990). There is a caveat here,\nsince all of these data were acquired with a large beam and\nsample most if not all of any extended emission present,\nwhereas our results are largely sensitive only to the dense\ncores of the HII regions observed. However, this overall trend\ndoes indicate a problem with the CoStar models, in the sense\nthat the far ultraviolet spectral energy distribution is harder\nthan observed.\nBy comparison, the WM-basic models allow a solution to both near and mid-infrared line ratios for Tef f \u223c\n35000 \u2212 37000K (the exact temperature is somewhat metallicity dependent). This range gives reasonable agreement between model and data for all three of the mid-infrared line\nratios listed above for the case of G29.96\u20130.02. This is perhaps surprising considering we have not run a detailed physical model such as the one Morisset et al. use. However, the\nagreement is basically a reflection of the fact that at a given\neffective temperature the WM-basic models are softer in the\nfar ultraviolet region of the spectrum than the CoStar models (see also Section 4.2 of Giveon et al. 2002), and appear\nto be a better match to the data for most HII regions (again\nsee Giveon et al).\nThe most useful direct constraint for G29.96\u20130.02 lies\nin a spectrum of the main exciting star (Watson & Hanson 1997, Hanson 1998, Kaper et al. 2002). The published\nspectral type for the star varies significantly between these\nreferences (as hot as O3 in Kaper et al., as cool as O8 in Watson & Hanson), but the most likely range is O4\u2013O6 from the\nstrengths of the CIV, HeI and HeII lines present (Hanson,\n\nprivate communication). This range is consistent with the\nphotometry of Watson et al. (1997), especially if we use a\nlower value for the extinction at K of 1.6 (as proposed by\nMorisset et al. 2002, and as determined from a preliminary\ncalibration of our own data for studying the extinction law).\nAlthough this would have an absolute magnitude at the limit\nfor a main sequence O4 star (eg. Vacca et al. 1996 or Hanson,\nHowarth & Conti 1997), it is still just consistent with that\ntype if the distance is only 6kpc (the cooler types are all consistent). It is worth noting that this range of spectral type is\nstill hotter than expected from the photoionisation models.\nThis is not surprising given the uncertainty over the effective\ntemperature/spectral type relation however (and the implication from all of the more recent work that this scale needs\nto shift to cooler temperatures). It does however emphasise\nthat we should still treat the existing stellar models with\nsome caution.\n\n4.3\n\nIndividual Sources: G5.89\u20130.39\n\nAnother useful individual example to consider is G5.89\u20130.39.\nThe distance to this source may be slightly less than reported in Wood & Churchwell (1989) but the effect is small,\nand the accuracy of the distance measure for this particular source is good (see Acord, Churchwell & Wood 1998\nfor a fuller discussion of the distance). For either distance\nhowever, there is a deficit of helium ionising photons in this\nsource, as is clear from Figure 11(a), where the observed HeI\n73,1 G\u201343,1 F/HI Br\u03b3 ratio is well below both any model prediction and the observed values for other sources with the\nsame expected effective temperature. This discrepancy cannot be explained by errors in the assignment of a spectral\ntype, since the distance is well known, and the radio emission compact. It is perhaps noteworthy that G5.89\u20130.39 may\nbe the youngest source in this sample. The HII region has an\nage of only a 600 years from estimates of its rate of expansion (Acord et al. 1998). There is also a substantial molecular outflow (Acord, Walmsley & Churchwell 1997) and an\ninfrared reflection nebulosity associated with it (Lumsden\n& Hoare in preparation), symptomatic of a rather young\nsource.\nFor the case of G5.89\u20130.39 it is tempting to consider the\npossibility that the stellar models used are actually inappropriate, and its young age may be the clue here. As noted\npreviously, there is some evidence that massive young stellar\nobjects appear to share spectral characteristics with hypergiants (Hamann & Persson 1989, Bunn et al. 1995). Both\nclasses of objects have dense slow moving stellar winds, giving rise to this similarity. It is also true that most massive\nyoung stellar objects do not show significant HII regions,\nalthough they are luminous enough to generate them. It is\nassumed that the winds act as sinks for much of the ultraviolet flux from the star, suppressing the ability to form an\nHII region, and probably also softening the spectral energy\ndistribution over that seen in main sequence stars. If the\nsame behaviour was also shown by the central stars of very\nyoung HII regions (perhaps because the atmosphere of the\nstar has not fully attained its main sequence structure) then\nit might explain a case such as this. G5.89\u20130.39 is actually\nmore luminous than the stars studied by Bunn et al., so even\nsome leakage of ultraviolet photons could lead to a substan-\n\n\fHelium and Hydrogen Line Ratios and The Stellar Content of Compact HII Regions\ntial HII region. Of course, we cannot prove this speculation\nfrom our current data.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented models for the infrared helium and hydrogen recombination line ratios in compact HII regions. We\nfail to find any model that can accurately reproduce the HeI\n21 P\u201321 S line strength as a function of effective temperature.\nWe therefore would discourage anyone from using this ratio\nas a constraint on the IMF, and any evidence derived from\nthe literature about the IMF in a particular system that\nrelies on this ratio should largely be discounted.\nOur results do show reasonable agreement between\nmodel and observation for pure recombination lines such as\nHeI 43 D\u201333 P or 73,1 G\u201343,1 F when ratioed with HI Br\u03b3 as\nlong as we use dwarf CoStar or WM-basic models. This indicates that these are in principle a useful measure of the\nstellar effective temperature of the hottest star present. The\nmain drawback with these ratios is the relatively small range\nof effective temperature over which they are useful (approximately over the range B0 to O8 for main sequence CoStar\nmodels for example). However, at least some of the galaxies\nin which the 1.7007\u03bcm HeI 43 D\u201333 P line has been detected\ndo have values of the ratio within this range (see, eg, Table\n4 of Vanzi & Rieke 1997). It should certainly help to address\nthe issue of whether there is evidence for an anomalous IMF\nfrom infrared data (see, eg, the review by Scalo 1998).\nWe have outlined possible reasons for the discrepancies\nseen between the observations and the models for the HeI\n21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio. The first, and perhaps most likely,\nis that the relative importance of photoionisation and collisional excitation from the 23 S HeI state may be incorrectly\nestimated by our HII region models. Clearly, from Figure 9,\nmodels in which the collisional depopulation of 23 S is dominant come closer to matching the observed data. However,\nit is still clear from Figure 12 that the HeI/HeI ratios are\ncloser to a flat function of effective temperature than the\ndeclining function predicted by Cloudy (in agreement with\nthe observations of the planetary nebulae in Papers 1 and\n2). It seems likely that errors in the 23 S de-population rate\nmay give rise to part but not all of the discrepancy seen.\nPerhaps, instead, the HeI 21 P\u201321 S line is telling us\nsomething about the nature of the ultraviolet spectral energy distribution of the exciting star? The current uncertainty in the model stellar atmospheres for massive stars\n(eg Martins et al. 2002) is unlikely to resolve this problem\nentirely however, since we have shown that the HeI/HI line\nratios have a relatively weak dependence on model when\ncomparing CoStar and WM-basic dwarf models. The effective reduction in luminosity given by any re-calibration of\nthe spectral type/effective temperature relation to cooler\ntemperatures may help to lessen the differences between\nthe model HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio and the observed data\nhowever.\nModels with a more realistic treatment of the stellar\nwind (such as the WM-basic set) also help to reduce the\ndiscrepancy between the pure HeI/HI recombination ratios\nand the mid-infrared forbidden line ratios, since the overall\nshape of the far ultraviolet continuum is clearly crucial in\nthat regard. They also help in closing the gap between the\n\n9\n\ndirect spectral type seen in G29.96\u20130.02 and the inferred\ntype from the photoionisation models. Similarly, consideration of changes in metallicity of the stellar model do not effect the HeI/HI ratios significantly, but can effect forbidden\nline ratios (eg Figure 5). There is evidence for a gradient of\nmetallicity with Galactocentric radius, with metallicity increasing inwards and excitation correspondingly decreasing\n(eg Giveon et al. 2002). Many of our sources lie within the\nsolar circle and are likely to have exciting stars with higher\nthan solar metallicity.\nThe most discrepant data point for all three helium\nlines is probably the youngest of the HII regions in the sample used here. We have outlined the possibility for this case\nthat the exciting star may actually resemble those massive\nyoung stellar objects studied by Bunn et al. (1995). In this\ncase a considerable fraction of the emitted ultraviolet flux is\nactually reprocessed into non-ionising radiation by a dense\nstellar wind reducing the excitation in the nebular gas. For\nthe moment this must remain purely speculative however.\nThe easiest way of testing whether our results indicate\nsome residual problems within the photoionisation model\nthat are not otherwise apparent from Papers 1 and 2 or a\ndeficiency on the assumed stellar models would be to obtain\nK band spectra of older, more evolved HII regions, such\nas those studied by Kennicutt et al. (2000). More evolved\nregions are less dense, and larger, and hence any residual\nuncertainty in the depopulation route from 23 S should be\nremoved. If the same effect as seen here were repeated then\nit would tend to indicate that even the latest stellar models\nare still not well matched to the actual ultraviolet continuum\nof OB stars.\n\n6\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nSLL acknowledges the support of PPARC through the award\nof an Advanced Research Fellowship.

The observed far infrared luminosities and ionising photon rates (from the\nradio) for our sample are taken from Wood & Churchwell (1989) and Kurtz, Churchwell & Wood (1994), except for G19.61\u2013\n0.23A where we used the 22GHz flux from Garay et al. (1998). The stellar effective temperatures are taken from Figure 2\nand represent the best matching CoStar and WM-basic models. The cluster temperature represents the temperature of the\nhottest star present. Where the cluster temperature is marked \u2013 the observed data are actually a better match to a single\nstar model (ie they lie significantly below the cluster line), and we do not consider a cluster model for that source. The 'best'\nmatching model is taken simply by dropping a vertical line down from the source onto the cluster and single star lines in\nFigure 2. Note we have chosen the nearest model in the set and not interpolated between models in deriving these values.\nName\nL (104 L\u2299 ) NLyC (log10 \u03b3/s)\nCoStar Tef f (K)\nWM-basic Tef f (K)\nSingle star Cluster Single star Cluster\nG5.89\u20130.39\n30.0\n48.65\n37170\n\u2013\n37200\n\u2013\nG5.97\u20131.17\n8.4\n47.40\n32060\n\u2013\n28500\n\u2013\nG19.61\u20130.23A\n26.1\n48.31\n35900\n\u2013\n34600\n\u2013\nG28.29\u20130.36\n11.7\n47.81\n32060\n\u2013\n32300\n\u2013\nG29.96\u20130.02\n198.0\n49.34\n43560\n39730\n45700\n40000\nG35.20\u20131.74\n28.3\n48.43\n35900\n\u2013\n34600\n\u2013\nG43.89\u20130.78\n27.6\n48.74\n38450\n\u2013\n37200\n\u2013\nG45.07+0.13\n142.4\n48.75\n38450\n35900\n37200\n34600\nG45.12+0.13\n166.0\n49.53\n46120\n41010\n50000\n40000\nG45.45+0.06\n144.0\n48.54\n35900\n34620\n34600\n32300\nK3-50a\n228.0\n49.29\n43560\n39730\n45700\n40000\nW51d\n341.0\n49.42\n44840\n39730\n45700\n40000\n\n\f12\n\nS.L.

We have plotted curves representing both the helium and hydrogen ionising continuum. The data for masses\n<\n19 M\u2299 come from Puxley (1988), using Kurucz (1979) models, since there are no CoStar models for this range. There is a\n\u223c\nclear discontinuity at the transition as seen in the right hand panel, but the actual results with regard to the expected total\nluminosity and ionising photon rate for a cluster of stars are not particularly affected by this.\n\nFigure 2: The observed properties of our sample as taken from Table 2. The model tracks represent single stars (lower) and\nclusters of stars (upper) from (a) the CoStar model set and (b) the WM-basic model set. The location of the specific models\ngiven in Table 3 of Schaerer & de Koter (1997) are marked by + in (a). These span the range B0.5V to O3V. Cluster models\nwere also constructed spanning this range. These were normalised so that at any upper mass cut-off, there was exactly one\nstar of that spectral type. The locations of these cluster models are marked by \u2217. The solid line for the single stars shows\nthe extension to lower masses assuming the use of the Kurucz (1979) models as described in the text. The locations of the\nWM-basic models given in Table 1 of Smith et al. (2002) are similarly indicated in (b). Note that the Smith et al. grid has\ncoarser sampling than the CoStar set. The arrows indicate the magnitude and direction of the likely error in the observational\ndata.\n\n\fHelium and Hydrogen Line Ratios and The Stellar Content of Compact HII Regions\n\n13\n\nFigure 3: Models of the HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio as (a) a function of the luminosity class of the exciting star, and of the\ninput stellar model set, and (b) a model stellar cluster. In (a) the CoStar models are shown as solid lines, and the WM-basic\nmodels as dotted lines. Note that the WM-basic grid is coarser than the CoStar grid, so the significance of the shift in\ntemperature of the peak in the line ratio between CoStar and WM-basic dwarf models is not clear. The larger line ratio at\nhigh effective temperature seen with the WM-basic models may in part be due to the lower luminosity of the dwarf models\ngiven in Smith et al. (2002). In (b) the comparison is between the results for the CoStar dwarf models when considered as a\nsingle star (dotted line) and a cluster with standard IMF. Clearly this line ratio depends on the temperature of the hottest\nstar present more than any other feature of the IMF.\n\nFigure 4: The same models as shown in Figure 3 but for the HeI 43 D\u201333 P/HI Br\u03b3 ratio. Note the relatively small offset\nbetween the CoStar and WM-basic dwarf models in (a), indicating that the comparison of HeI/HI line ratios is not a good\ntest of the detailed shape of the spectral energy distribution of the exciting star(s). Clearly (b) shows there are no differences\nfor this ratio between a single star and a cluster.\n\n\f14\n\nS.L. Lumsden, P.J. Puxley, M.G. Hoare, T.J.T. Moore, N.A. Ridge\n\nFigure 5: A similar comparison to Figure 3 and 4 but using the mid-infrared 15.6\u03bcm [NeIII] to 12.8\u03bcm [NeII] line ratio.\nThis plot shows that there are significant detectable differences between the stellar models with forbidden metal lines. It also\nshows the role that metallicity plays in determining such a line ratio, with a difference of a factor of two or more in the final\nratio.\n\nFigure 6: The dependence of (a) the HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio and (b) the HeI 43 D\u201333 P/HI Br\u03b3 ratio as a function of\nmetallicity using the WM-basic model set. Clearly, metallicity has a weak effect on determining these line ratios.\n\n\fHelium and Hydrogen Line Ratios and The Stellar Content of Compact HII Regions\n\n15\n\nFigure 7: Variation of the HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio as a function of turbulent velocity. The models shown use CoStar dwarf\nmodels and the turbulent velocity has values of 0, 5, 10 and 15kms\u22121 . The result is very similar to that obtained for planetary\nnebulae in Paper 1.\n\nFigure 8: Models of the HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio for a variety of electron densities. In (a), the density is constant throughout\nthe HII region, with values of ne =1000, 3000, 6000, 10000 and 50000cm\u22123 . In (b), a constant density of ne =1000cm\u22123 is\nsuperposed on a Gaussian radial distribution with peak density of ne =1000, 3000, 6000, 10000 and 50000cm\u22123 . The Gaussian\nhas a full width at half maximum of 0.3 pc. Some of the specific models are indicated on the plot. All models use CoStar\ndwarf stellar atmospheres.\n\n\f16\n\nS.L. Lumsden, P.J. Puxley, M.G. Hoare, T.J.T. Moore, N.A. Ridge\n\nFigure 9: Models of the HeI 21 P\u201321 S/HI Br\u03b3 ratio for an extended HII region excited by a single CoStar dwarf stellar\natmosphere. We assume a flat electron density. The solid lines show the same densities as in Figure 8(a) with an inner nebular\nradius of 0.3 pc. The dashed line shows a single density but with an inner radius of 1 pc. These models correspond to a\nprogressive decline in the ionisation parameter at the inner surface of the nebula. The peak in the ratio clearly shifts to higher\neffective temperature, and the role of collisional de-excitation of the 23 S level must also increase with decreasing ionisation\nparameters to explain these results.\n\nFigure 10: Observed ratios of HeI 21 P\u201321 S and HI Br\u03b3. Vertical error bars are actual observed errors. Horizontal error bars\nrepresent the likely span in the effective temperature of the hottest star present. The extreme right point of the error bar\nrepresents Tef f for a single exciting star, the extreme left point represents Tef f for a cluster as outlined in Section 2. Therefore\nthe observed data point should be thought of as lying at either extreme of the error bar, but not the central position. Real\nobservational error in our indirect spectral typing from Figure 2 can shift these points as much as 4000K. The models are\na selection of those from Figures 7, 8 and 9, showing the range given by varying electron density, turbulent velocity and\nionisation parameters for the CoStar dwarf model set. The solid lines show models with ne = 50000cm\u22123 and turbulent\nvelocity of 0kms\u22121 (upper curves) and ne = 1000cm\u22123 and turbulent velocity of 15kms\u22121 (lower curves). The dotted lines\nshow the same models but with inner nebular radius of 0.3 pc. The dashed line shows a model with inner nebular radius of\n1 pc, ne = 50000cm\u22123 and turbulent velocity of 5kms\u22121 . The observed ratio is not a good fit to any of these curves, though\nthe models in which collisional de-excitation dominates photoionisation of HeI 23 S are a better match.\n\n\fHelium and Hydrogen Line Ratios and The Stellar Content of Compact HII Regions\n\n17\n\nFigure 11: Observed ratios of (a) HeI 73,1 G\u201343,1 F and (b) HeI 43 D\u201333 P with HI Br\u03b3. Vertical error bars are again actual\nobserved errors, and horizontal error bars have the same meaning as in Figure 10. The models shown in (a) are for CoStar\ndwarfs, and in (b) for WM-basic dwarfs. There is essentially no variation of these curves with density, turbulent velocity or\nradial density profile. The observed data are mostly a reasonable match to both CoStar and WM-basic dwarf models. The\nmatch argues that our indirect spectral typing is also reasonable.\n\nFigure 12: Observed ratios of HeI 21 P\u201321 S with (a) HeI 43 D\u201333 P and (b) HeI 73,1 G\u201343,1 F. The models plotted are the same\nas in Figure 10, and the error bars have the same meaning as there. Again high density low ionisation parameter models are\nthe best match.\n\n\f"}
