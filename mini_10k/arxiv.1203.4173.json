Entanglement can be\nachieved via two interacting quantum systems [6] or by\nan appropriate joint measurement of two systems [7]. An\nimportant use of entanglement is the sharing of multipartite states distributed amongst several different parties\nthat are separated by large distances where the performance of local measurements on their respective subsystems results in the global broadcasting of the outcomes\nof local measurements. The latter is used in standard\nquantum key distribution [8] and quantum secret sharing [9]. Accordingly, generating multipartite entanglement is an important objective in experimental quantum systems. For instance, experimental realizations of\nfour-photon entanglement and high-fidelity teleportation\n[10], entangled states of two and four trapped ions [11],\nthe entanglement of two Rydberg atoms in microwave\ncavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) [12], optically\ninduced entanglement of excitons in a single quantum\ndot [13], creation of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\nstates with up to 14 qubits [14], and the entanglement\nof a six-photon symmetric Dicke state [15]. On the theoretical side, many methods based on cavity QED have\nbeen proposed, for instance, a hybrid quantum correlated\ntripartite system formed by an optical cavity and a microwave cavity [16], generating n-qubit GHZ entangled\nstates with a three-level qubit system and (n \u2212 1) four-\n\n\u2217 alexanian@uncw.edu\n\nlevel qubit systems in a cavity [17], and the generation\nof maximally entangled GHZ state as a ground state of\na three spin system [18]. In general, the more particles\nor states can be entangled, the more clearly non-classical\neffects are exhibited and the more useful such entangled\nstates are for quantum applications [19, 20].\nIn the study of three-level atoms, a transformation\nwas introduced [21] whereby the three-level atom was\nreduced to a corresponding two-level atom of the JaynesCummings type albeit with two-photon rather than\nsingle-photon transitions. This model has been used in\ncavity QED to generate \"macroscopic\" qubits [22] and\nin the scattering of two coherent photons inside a onedimensional coupled-resonator waveguide that operates\nas an ideal quantum switch [23]. The model has been applied to two-photon exchange between two separate cavities [24] with each cavity containing a three-level atom\nin a cascade (or ladder) configuration [25] and coupled\nvia a two-photon hopping interaction [24]. The coupling\nfor two-photon hopping would require a nonlinear media\nthat may be governed by a quantum Kerr-type interaction [26]. The latter work [24] was restricted to the\nN = 2 manifold, where N denotes the maximum number of photons possible in a given cavity. More recently,\nwe extended our study to the dynamics of the N = 4\nmanifold and showed how the temporal development of\nthe coupled two-cavity system generates maximally entangled states in both the N = 2 and N = 4 manifolds\nfrom an initially unentangled state [27].\nIn order to realize maximally entangled states, one\nmust consider high Q-factor cavities and excited states\nthat are long-lived. Owing to angular momentum and\nparity conservation, the simultaneous emissions of two\nphotons possess increased lifetimes and thus are essentially metastable states. For instance, single-photon\natomic transitions are of the order of 10\u22128 s whereas the\n\n\f2\ntwo-photon emissions have much longer lifetimes, of the\norder of fractions of a second. This makes the study\nof two-photon processes quite interesting as compared\nto single-photon transitions. In addition, two-photon\nspectroscopy has been recently used to probe the hybridization between a superconducting phase qubit and\nan intrinsic two-level system coupling to the qubit circuit [28]. The detailed data on experiments allow the\nmapping out of this hybrid system, combining two coherent quantum systems that are fundamentally different in nature [28]. The experimental realization of the\ntransmon qubit, which is an improved superconducting\ncharge qubit derived from the Cooper pair box, considers two-photon transitions that could help design more\nrobust quantum computers [29]. A recent study of the\npossibility of coherent reversal information transfer between superconducting charge qubits and mesoscopic ultracold atomic ensembles coupled to a microwave coplanar waveguide is based on two-photon optically excited\nRydberg transitions\u2013from the ground state to the Rydberg state via a nonresonant intermediate Rydberg state\n[30]. The experimental implementation of the latter proposal is currently underway to demonstrate hybridization\nof solid-state and atomic quantum devices [30].\nIn this paper, we consider a system of three identical\ncavities each with a three-level atom where the cavities\nare coupled to each other by a hopping interaction that\nexchanges two coherent photons. We consider the generation of entangled tripartite states from initially unentangled states in the manifolds N =2, 4, and 6, which lie\nin a 6-, 18-, and 38-dimensional Hilbert space, respectively. Our system of three identical cavities consists of\nthree atoms and one, two, and three pairs of photons in\nthe manifolds N =2, 4, and 6, respectively. Accordingly,\ngeneralized measurements [31], by using only linear elements and particle detectors, may be possible on the\ngenerated entangled pure states.\nII.\n\nHAMILTONIAN\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the three coupled cavities [27] is\ngiven by\nH=\n\n3\nX\n\u0002\ni=1\n\n+\n\n(i) \u0003\n\nH (i) \u2212 H0\n\n2\nh\u0304\u03be(a\u20202\n1 a3\n\n+\n\n2\na\u20202\n3 a1 )\n\n+\n\n\u20202 2\n2\n+ h\u0304\u03be(a\u20202\n1 a2 + a2 a1 )\n\n(i)\n|\u03a8\u2212\n= cos\u03b8n |e, ni(i) \u2212 sin\u03b8n |g, n + 2i(i) ,\nni\n\nwhere |gi(i) and |ei(i) are the ground and the excited\natomic states, respectively, |ni(i) is the photon number\neigenstate and\n[n(r2\n\nr(n + 2)1/2\n+ 1) + 2r2 + 1]1/2\n\n[n(r2\n\n(n + 1)1/2\n,\n+ 1) + 2r2 + 1]1/2\n\ncos\u03b8n =\nsin\u03b8n =\n\n+\n\n2\na\u20202\n3 a2 ),\n\nEn+ = h\u0304\u03c9(n + 1) +\n\nEg + Ee\n\u2206\n\u2212\n2\n2\n\n1\n+ {\u22062 + 4h\u03042 [g12 (n + 2) + g22 (n + 1)]}1/2\n2\nEn\u2212 = h\u0304\u03c9(n + 1) +\n\n(4)\n\nEg + Ee\n,\n2\n\nwhere gj (j = 1, 2) are the atom-photon coupling constants in the three-level atom, Eg is the energy of the\nground state, Ee is the energy of the excited state, and\n\u2206 = (Eg \u2212 E2 ) + h\u0304\u03c9 = (Ee \u2212 E2 ) \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9 is the detuning\nparameter of the mid level with energy E2 of the threelevel atom in a cascade (or ladder) configuration.

However, owing to\nthe constancy of the total operator N\u0302 = N\u0302 (1) + N\u0302 (2) +\nN\u0302 (3) , the space is spanned by only 6 rather than 33 = 27\nvectors.\nThe most general unentangled initial tripartite state in\nthe N = 2 manifold is\ni\nh\n(5)\n|\u03c8(0)i = |g, 0i(1) |g, 0i(2) a|g, 2i(3) + b|e, 0i(3) ,\n\n\f3\nwhere |a|2 + |b|2 = 1 and |gi(i) and |ei(i) are the ground\nand the excited atomic states, respectively, and |ni(i) is\nthe photon number eigenstate with i = 1, 2, 3 denoting\nthe cavity. The initial state (5) is only symmetric in the\nexchange 1 \u2194 2 and cavity 3 is in an entangled state given\n(3)\nby the linear superposition of dressed states |\u03a8\u00b1\n. Ow0i\ning to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian (1), the general\nsolution preserves that symmetry and is given by\ni\nh\n|\u03c8(t)i = |g, 0i(1) |g, 0i(2) A(t)|g, 2i(3) + C(t)|e, 0i(3)\n\nwhere the amplitudes A(t) and B(t) are periodic with\nperiod T = \u03c0/\u03be. Result (9) agrees with the general results given by (A3) in Appendix A for the corresponding\namplitudes. Note that the state (6) becomes unentangled for times \u03c4 such that \u03be\u03c4 = \u03c0n/3, n = 1, 2, * * *, that\nis, B(\u03c4 ) = 0.

(7), we have introduced the dimensionless time\n[(E0+ \u2212 E0\u2212 ) cos2 \u03b80 ]t/h\u0304 \u2192 t and the dimensionless hopping coupling h\u0304\u03be/[(E0+ \u2212 E0\u2212 ) cos2 \u03b80 ] \u2192 \u03be with the angle \u03b80 representing the mixing angle (3) for the atomic\ndressed states. The system of equations (7) gives rise to\nanalytic solutions for arbitrary values of the parameters\nr and \u03be. However, we shall consider the case of large\nhopping strength \u03be \u226b 1 when the exchange of two coherent photons occurs at a much faster rate than the rate\nof atomic transitions. In that case, one has the separate\nprobability conservation\n|A(t)|2 + |B(t)|2 \u2248 |a|2\n\nand\n\n|C(t)|2 \u2248 |b|2 .\n\n(8)\n\nNote that the amplitude C(t) associated with cavity 3 being in the excited state is separately conserved according\nto (8). This follows directly from considering the limit of\nlarge hopping strength, viz, \u03be \u226b 1. Similarly, for the amplitudes A(t) and B(t) associated with all three cavities\nbeing in the ground state that are separately conserved\nas indicated in (8).\nTherefore, one achieves maximal entanglement for\ntimes T when |A(T )|2 + |C(T )|2 is a minimum, that is,\n|A(T )| is a minimum with C(0) = b = 0.

Both symmetric states are entangled since there\nare no unentangled, symmetric state in the N = 2 manifold. Therefore, the six-dimensional space for the N = 2\nmanifold is spanned, in addition to these two symmetric\nstates, by four asymmetric vectors.\nIV.\n\nN=4 MANIFOLD\n\nThe Hilbert space of the N = 4 manifold corresponds\nto each atom in the three-cavity system being described\nby the five-dimensional qudit |g, 4i, |g, 2i, |g, 0i, |e, 0i,\nand |e, 2i. However, the space is spanned by only 18 vectors rather than 35 = 125 vectors owing to the constancy\nof the operator N\u0302 and so a general state is given by (B1)\nin Appendix B.

On the other hand, the initial state (13) for ad 6= bc 6= 0 is not symmetric in the\nexchange 2 \u2194 3 and so lies in the full 18-dimensional\nspace. However, for ad = bc the initial state (13) is\nsymmetric in the exchange 2 \u2194 3 and so the initial\nstate lies also in an 11-dimensional subspace. Owing to\nthe complexity of the full 18-dimensional vector space,\nwe shall consider the limit of large hopping strength\nh\u0304\u03be/[(E2+ \u2212E2\u2212 ) cos2 \u03b82 ] \u226b 1 when the exchange of two coherent photons between the cavities is much faster than\natomic transitions.\nConsider first the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equations (B2)\u2013(B7) for the initial unentangled state (12),\nthat is, F (0) = a and K(0) = b in (B1). The general\n18-dimensional vector (B1) in the N = 4 manifold must\nbe symmetric in the interchange of cavities 1 \u2194 2 and so\nthe only nonzero amplitudes are given by G(t) = A(t),\nP (t) = B(t), N (t) = E(t), C(t), F (t), and K(t). Therefore, the solution is\n#\n\"\n|\u03c8(t)i \u2248 A(t) |g, 4i(1) |g, 0i(2) + |g, 0i(1) |g, 4i(2) |g, 0i(3)\n#\n\n\"\n\n+ |g, 0i(1) |g, 2i(2) + |g, 2i(1) |g, 0i(2) \u00d7\n\"\n\n(3)\n\n\u00d7 B(t)|g, 2i\n\n(3)\n\n+ E(t)|e, 0i\n\n#\n\n(14)\n\n+C(t)|g, 2i(1) |g, 2i(2) |g, 0i(3)\n\"\n\n#\n\n+|g, 0i(1) |g, 0i(2) F (t)|g, 4i(3) + K(t)|e, 2i(3) ,\n\n#\n\"\n1\n8i\u03bet\n6i\u03bet\n\u221212i\u03bet\n\u22124i\u03bet\nF (t) =\na 3e\n+ 4e\n+ 2e\n+ 6e\n15\n#\n\"\n1\n2i\u03bet\n\u22124i\u03bet\nK(t) = b 2e\n.\n+e\n3\nThe amplitudes in (15) are periodic with period T =\n\u03c0/\u03be. Note that for any probability amplitude X(t), if\ndn X(t)\ndtn |t=0 = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2, * * *, then X(t) \u2261 0 since\nthe solutions of the dynamical equations are entire functions of t. The latter has been used in Eqs (B2)\u2013(B7)\nto arrive at the five nonzero amplitudes given in (15)\nfor solution (14). Note that 2|E(t)|2 + |K(t)|2 = |b|2 and\n2|A(t)|2 +2|B(t)|2 +|C(t)|2 +|F (t)|2 = |a|2 are separately\nconserved with the sum giving the overall probability of\nunity. This feature of disjoint sectors of the Hilbert space,\ndetermined by the number of atoms in the excited state,\nis a direct result of large hopping strength and occurs in\nall the different manifolds.\nOne obtains maximal entanglement for the initial state\n(12) with a = 0 by maximizing |E(t)|2 , or what is the\nsame by minimizing |K(t)|2 , which occurs at a time \u03c4\ngiven by \u03c4 \u03be = \u03c0/6, where |K(\u03c4 )|2 = 1/9 and 2|E(\u03c4 )|2 =\n8/9 . The measure of entanglement is log2 9 \u2248 3.170 that\nis the same as for the N = 2 manifold albeit for different\nstates.\nOn the other hand, for the initial state with b = 0\nin Eq. (12), that is, all four photons are initially in\ncavity 3, there are several interesting entangled states\nobtained, for instance, by either maximizing or minimizing |A(t)|2 + |B(t)|2 , which is the same as minimizing or\nmaximizing |C(t)|2 + |F (t)|2 . For instance, minimization\nof |C(t)|2 + |F (t)|2 occurs at \u03be\u03c4 \u2248 0.2094, 0.8378 with\n|C(\u03c4 )|2 + |F (\u03c4 )|2 \u2248 0.1960 resulting in a lower measure\nof entanglement log2 (1/0.1960) \u2248 2.351. The probabilities for the entangled states are 2|A(\u03c4 )|2 \u2248 .2251 and\n2|B(\u03c4 )|2 \u2248 .5789. Is is interesting that at \u221a\n\u03be\u03c4 =\n\u221a \u03c0/3 one\nhas that A(\u03c4 ) = B(\u03c4 )\u221a= 0 with C(\u03c0/3) = 3 2( 3\u2212i)/10\nand F (\u03c0/3) = (1 + 3 3i)/10. Therefore, the probability\nthat all four photons remain in cavity 3 is 28% with the\nremaining 72% with cavities 1 and 2 sharing two photons\nequally.\n\n\f5\nB.\n\nInitial state Eq. (13)\n\nConsider next the initial unentangled state (13), that\nis, L(0) = bd, M (0) = bc, N (0) = ad, and P (0) = ac,\nwith the time evolution of the probability amplitudes\ngiven by Eqs. (B2)\u2013(B7). Now B(t) = C(t) and\nG(t) = F (t) according to Eq. (B3), D(t) = J(t) follows from Eq. (B4), Eq.(B5) gives that E(t) = K(t),\nwhile T (t) = U (t) = 0 from Eq. (B6), and Eq.

This feature of disjoint sectors of the Hilbert space for states with\none, two, or none of the atoms in the cavities in the excited state is a direct result of considering the limit of\nlarge hopping strength.\nConsider the case with symmetry under the cavityinterchange 2 \u2194 3, that is, c = a and d = b in Eq.

However, for the initial state\n|g, 0i(1) |g, 2i(2) |g, 2i(3) , that is, a = c = 1 and b = d = 0\nin (13), one has\n|\u03c8(t)i = A(t)|g, 4i(1) |g, 0i(2) |g, 0i(3)\n(1)\n\n+ B(t)|g, 2i\n\n\"\n\n|g, 0i\n\n(1)\n\n+F (t)|g, 0i\n\n(2)\n\n\"\n\n|g, 2i\n\n(2)\n\n|g, 0i\n\n(3)\n\n+ |g, 2i\n\n(3)\n\n|g, 4i\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n|g, 0i\n\n(2)\n\n+ |g, 4i\n\n#\n\n(3)\n\n|g, 0i\n\n(18)\n\n#\n\n+P (t)|g, 0i(1) |g, 2i(2) |g, 2i(3) ,\nwhere the amplitudes are given in (17) with a = c = 1\nand b = d = 0 and the normalization by |A(t)|2 +\n2|B(t)|2 + 2|F (t)|2 + |P (t)|2 = 1. One obtains maximal entanglement for the state (18) if one minimizes\n|A(t)|2 + |P (t)|2 . The same minimum occurs for \u03be\u03c4 \u2248\n.1930, 0.8542, 1.2402.

The measurement of entanglement is \u2212 log2 (|A(\u03c4 )|2 + |P (\u03c4 )|2 ) \u2248\n2.450.\nIs is interesting that at\u221a\n\u03be\u03c4 = \u03c0/3\n\u221a one has that B(\u03c4 ) =\nF (\u03c4 ) \u221a\n= 0 with A(\u03c0/3) = 6(3 \u2212 3i)/10 and P (\u03c0/3) =\n(2 + 3i)/5. Therefore, the probability that the system\nis in its initial state with two photons each in cavities\n2 and 3 is 28% while the probability of four photons in\ncavity 1 is 72%.\n\n\f6\nV.\n\nN=6 MANIFOLD\n\nThe seven-dimensional qudit associated with the states\nof each cavity in the N = 6 manifold are |g, 6i, |g, 4i,\n|g, 2i, |g, 0i, |e, 0i, |e, 2i, and |e, 4i, which gives rise to\n73 = 343 states for the three-cavity system. However,\nowing to the operator N\u0302 being a constant of the motion,\nthe relevant Hilbert subspace for the N = 6 manifold\nis only 38-dimensional. The dimensionality is given by\n1 \u00d7 10 + 3 \u00d7 6 + 3 \u00d7 3 + 1 \u00d7 1 = 38, where the terms in\nthe sum correspond to sectors a, b, c, and d, respectively\n(See Appendix C). In sector a, all three cavities are in\nthe ground state and there are six photons to be shared\npairwise amongst the three cavities. In sector b, one of\nthe cavities is in the excited state, two are in the ground\nstate, and there are four photons to be shared pairwise.\nIn sector c, two of the cavities are in the excited state,\nonly one of the cavities is in the ground state, and there\nare two photons to be shared. Finally, in sector d, all\nthree cavities are in the excited state and there are no\nphotons to be shared amongst the three cavities.\nThe most general unentangled, initial states in the N =\n6 manifold are\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(1)\n(1)\n|g, 0i(2) |g, 0i(3) , (19)\n|\u03c8(0)i = a|g, 6i + b|e, 4i\n\nand not atomic excitations. The equations for the 38\nprobability amplitudes break up into linear differential\nequations involving ten, eighteen, nine, and one amplitudes, respectively [see (C2), (C3), (C8), (C9), (C11),\nand (C13)]. Note that for the case when all three cavities are in the excited state, the probability amplitude\nremains constant in time [see (C13)]. All these differential equations can be solved analytically in terms of\nexponential functions for arbitrary initial states.\n\nA.\n\nInitial state Eq. (19)\n\nThe initial state given by Eq.

We\nconsider the initial state with a = 1 and so b = 0, that is,\nA(0) = 1 in (C1) with the solution in the subspace of sector a. The solution is given by (C4), where all the probability amplitudes have analytic solutions in terms of exponential functions and the results for A(t) and F (t) are\ngiven explicitly by (C5) and (C6), respectively.

The initial state (20) is\nstrictly asymmetric. The initial state (21) may be symmetric or asymmetric under the interchange of any two\nor all three cavities depending on the values of the initial amplitudes.

In addition, for any probability\namplitude X(\u03bet), |X(\u03bet)|2 = |X(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03bet)|2 .\nMaximal entanglement is obtained by minimizing\n|C(t)|2 +|D(t)|2 , which cannot vanish owing to the initial\nstate being strictly asymmetric. Minimization occurs for\n\u03be\u03c4 \u2248 0.1930, 0.8542, where the minima have the same\nvalues and is |C(\u03c4 )|2 + |D(\u03c4 )|2 \u2248 0.1829.

We\nconsider atom/photon states for each cavity that corresponds to a multileveled system of three-, five-, and\nseven-dimensional spaces. However, the dynamical state\nof the system, owing to conservation laws, lie in subspaces given by 6, 18, and 38 dimensions rather than the\nusual 33 = 27, 53 = 125, and 73 = 343, respectively.\nExplicit analytic solutions are found for arbitrary initial\nunentangled pure states in the manifolds N =2, 4, and 6\nwhen the exchange of photons between cavities occurs at\na much faster rate than the rate of atomic transitions, the\nlarge hopping limit. Tripartite entanglement between the\ncavities can be used to generate bipartite entanglement\nbetween any two cavities via local quantum operations,\nwhich can be performed either on the atom or on the\nphoton pairs or even on both the atom/photon state of a\n\n\f8\ngiven cavity. Dynamically generated tripartite entangled\nstates, which reflect the symmetry of the Hamiltonian\nand the symmetry properties of the initially unentangled\nstate, are given by the superposition of symmetric, antisymmetric, and asymmetric states. The symmetric states\nare generalizations of the W-states.\n\ni\n1h\n\u2212 A(0) + 2B(0) \u2212 C(0) e2i\u03bet ,\n3\n\n+\n\ni\n1h\n\u2212 A(0) \u2212 B(0) + 2C(0) e2i\u03bet ,\n3\n\nAppendix A: N=2 manifold\n\n|\u03c8(t)i = A(t)|g, 0i(1) |g, 0i(2) |g, 2i(3)\n+B(t)|g, 0i(1) |g, 2i(2) |g, 0i(3) +C(t)|g, 2i(1) |g, 0i(2) |g, 0i(3)\n(A1)\n+D(t)|g, 0i(1) |g, 0i(2) |e, 0i(3) +E(t)|g, 0i(1) |e, 0i(2) |g, 0i(3)\n\nD(t) \u2248 D(0)\n\ni\u0226 = A + 2\u03beB + 2\u03beC + tan \u03b80 D,\n(A2)\n\ni\u010a = 2\u03beA + 2\u03beB + C + tan \u03b80 F,\n\nThe Hilbert space for three cavities with the state of\neach cavity given by the five-dimensional qudit |g, 4i,\n|g, 2i, |g, 0i, |e, 0i, and |e, 2i, normally lies in a Hilbert\nspace of 53 = 125 dimensions.

The\npreceding gives rise to 26 vectors. In addition, one must\nadd to that set the 10 vectors that are the product of the\nvector |g, 0i(1) and the linear superposition of the vectors |g, 6i(2) |g, 0i(3) , |g, 0i(2) |g, 6i(3) , |g, 4i(2) |e, 0i(3) ,\n|e, 0i(2) |g, 4i(3) ,\n|g, 4i(2) |g, 2i(3) ,\n|g, 2i(2) |g, 4i(3) ,\n(2)\n(3)\n(2)\n(3)\n(2)\n|e, 2i |g, 2i , |g, 2i |e, 2i , |e, 4i |g, 0i(3) , and\n|g, 0i(2) |e, 4i(3) . Finally, we have to add unentangled\nsymmetric vectors, which cannot occur in the N = 2\nand N = 4 manifolds, viz., |g, 2i(1) |g, 2i(2) |g, 2i(3) and\n|e, 0i(1) |e, 0i(2) |e, 0i(3) , for a total of 38 vectors.\nIn the N = 6 manifold, the initial unentangled state\nthat is totally symmetric in all three cavities is given by\ni\nih\nh\n|\u03c8(0)i = a|g, 2i(1) + b|e, 0i(1) a|g, 2i(2) + b|e, 0i(2) \u00d7\n(D1)\n\nwhere |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. The case with b = 0 reduces to\nthat considered in Appendix C in sector a for \u03be \u226b 1.\nThe trivial case a = 0 gives a constant amplitude as\nindicated in (C13).\nThe general symmetric state is given by\n|\u03c8(t)i = A(t)|g, 2i(1) |g, 2i(2) |g, 2i(3)\n1 X\n+B(t) \u221a\nP |e, 0i(1) |g, 2i(2) |g, 2i(3)\n3 P\n1 X\nP |e, 0i(1) |e, 0i(2) |g, 2i(3)\n+C(t) \u221a\n3 P\n+D(t)|e, 0i(1) |e, 0i(2) |e, 0i(3)\n\n(D2)\n\n1 X\nP |g, 4i(1) |g, 2i(2) |g, 0i(3)\n+F (t) \u221a\n6 P\n1 X\nP |e, 2i(1) |g, 2i(2) |g, 0i(3)\n+G(t) \u221a\n6 P\n1 X\nP |e, 2i(1) |e, 0i(2) |g, 0i(3)\n+H(t) \u221a\n6 P\n\nAppendix D: Symmetric N=6\n\ni\nh\n\u00d7 a|g, 2i(3) + b|e, 0i(3) ,\n\n1 X\nP |g, 4i(1) |e, 0i(2) |g, 0i(3)\n+ E(t) \u221a\n6 P\n\n1 X\nP |g, 6i(1) |g, 0i(2) |g, 0i(3)\n+K(t) \u221a\n3 P\n1 X\nP |e, 4i(1) |g, 0i(2) |g, 0i(3) ,\n+J(t) \u221a\n3 P\nwhere for the amplitudes B(t), C(t), K(t), and J(t)\nthe sum is only over even permutation of the cavities;\nwhereas, for E(t), F (t), G(t), and H(t) the sum is over\nboth even and odd permutation. The state (D2) brings\nforth all 38 states that span the N = 6 manifold, which\ncorresponds to 10 symmetric, 4 antisymmetric, and 24\nasymmetric states that treats all the three cavities on the\nsame footing. The antisymmetric states follow from the\nstates associated with the amplitudes E(t), F (t), G(t),\nand H(t) in (D2), where a \u22121 is inserted before those\nterms arising from an odd permutation.\nThe symmetric states are either entangled or unentangled, with the former coming in two varieties, viz.,\ninvolving three or six states. The presence of only two\nunentangled symmetric states indicates that in the N = 6\nmanifold one does not have the general GHZ maximally\nentangled state for the seven-dimensional qudit associated with each of the three cavities in the space spanned\nby 73 = 343 vectors,\n1 X (1) (2) (3)\n|GHZi = \u221a\n|ji |ji |ji ,\n7 j\n\n(D3)\n\nwhere the sum over j is over the states |g, 6i, |g, 4i, |g, 2i,\n|g, 0i, |e, 0i, |e, 2i, and |e, 4i and the trace over one of the\nthree cavities gives rise to an unentangled mixed state.\nIn the N = 6 manifold, the trace over one of the three\ncavities of the symmetric states involving six states produces an entangled reduced density matrix for each cavity given by the three states that span that space. However, a trace over two of the three cavities, for instance,\nthe reduced density matrix for each cavity associated\nwith the probability amplitude E(t) in (D2) is given by\n\u03c1 = 13 [|g, 0ihg, 0| + |e, 0ihe, 0| + |g, 4ihg, 4|.\n\n\f12\nIn the large hopping limit \u03be \u226b [(E4+ \u2212 E4\u2212 ) cos2 \u03b84 ] the\nequations for the probability amplitudes decouple and\nare as follows: For A(t), F (t) and K(t)\ndA\ni\n\u2248 12\u03beF,\ndt\n\u221a\ndF\n\u2248 12\u03beA + 2 30\u03beK,\ni\ndt\ni\n\nK(t) =\n\n(D4)\n\n\u221a\ndK\n\u2248 2 30\u03beF,\ndt\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndB\n\u2248 4 3\u03beE + 2 2\u03beG,\ndt\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndE\n\u2248 4 3\u03beB + 2 6\u03beG,\ndt\n\n(D5)\n\n(D6)\n\nand for C(t) and H(t)\n\nh\nE(t) = a2 b 0.4607e\u221211.2644i\u03bet + 0.3401e\u22123.7306i\u03bet (D9)\n\nh\nJ(t) = a2 b 0.2989e\u221211.2644i\u03bet \u2212 0.5684e\u22123.7306i\u03bet\ni\n\u22120.1939e8.6745i\u03bet + 0.4633e6.3205i\u03bet .\n\n\u221a\ndC\ni\n\u2248 2 2\u03beH,\ndt\n\u221a\ndH\ni\n\u2248 2 2\u03beC.\ndt\n\nFor B(t), E(t), G(t), and J(t), one has exact solutions;\nhowever, we present their simpler numeric rather than\nthe purely analytic results and so\nh\nB(t) = a2 b 0.4054e\u221211.2644i\u03bet + 0.3995e\u22123.7306i\u03bet\n\ni\n+0.2427e8.6745i\u03bet \u2212 .4227e6.3205i\u03bet ,\n\nfor D(t),\ndD\n\u2248 0,\ndt\n\nh\ni\n\u221a\n1\u221a\n30a3 cos(2 66\u03bet) \u2212 1 .\n11\n\nh\nG(t) = a2 b 0.4860e\u221211.2644i\u03bet \u2212 .3061e\u22123.7306i\u03bet\n\n\u221a\ndJ\n\u2248 4 3\u03beG,\ndt\n\ni\n\n(D8)\n\ni\n\u22120.2040e8.6745i\u03bet \u2212 0.5968e6.3205i\u03bet ,\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndG\n\u2248 2 2\u03beB + 2 6\u03beE + 4 3\u03beJ,\ndt\ni\n\n\u221a\n1 3\u221a\na 66i sin(2 66\u03bet),\n11\n\ni\n+0.0838e8.6745i\u03bet + 0.8433e6.3205i\u03bet ,\n\nfor B(t), E(t), G(t), and J(t)\ni\n\nF (t) = \u2212\n\nFor D(t) one has that,\n(D7)\n\nThe initial conditions for\u221athe state (D1) \u221acorrespond\nto A(0) = a3 , B(0) = 3a2 b, C(0) = 3ab2 , and\nD(0) = b3 .
