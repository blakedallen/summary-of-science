Let N be a natural\nnumber (N \u2265 2), and let \u03c9N := {x1 , . . . , xN } be a collection of N distinct points on\n\nS d . The Riesz s-energy (s \u2265 0) associated with \u03c9N , Es (\u03c9N ), is defined by\n\uf8f1X\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n,\nif s > 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n|xi \u2212 xj |s\ni6=j\nEs (\u03c9N ) := X\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nlog\n, if s = 0.\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n|xi \u2212 xj |\ni6=j\n\nHere | * | denotes the Euclidean norm. We use Es (S d , N ) to denote the N -point\n\nminimal s-energy over S d defined by\n\nEs (S d , N ) := min Es (\u03c9N ),\n\u03c9N \u2282S d\n\n\u2217\n\n(1.1)\n\nThe first author is supported in part by FWO-Flanders projects G.0176.02 and G.0455.04, by K.U.Leuven\n\nresearch grant OT/04/24, by INTAS Research Network NeCCA 03-51-6637, and by NATO Collaborative\nLinkage Grant PST.CLG.979738.\n\u2020\nThis author is supported, in part, by a U.S. National Science Foundation grant DMS-0296026.\n\n1\n\n\f2\nwhere the infimum is taken over all N -point subsets of S d . If \u03c9N \u2282 S d is such that\nEs (\u03c9N ) = Es (S d , N ),\nthen \u03c9N is called a minimal s-energy configuration, and the points in \u03c9N are called\nminimal s-energy points, or simply minimal energy points if the linkage to the parameter s is well-understood in a certain context. It is obvious that minimal s-energy\nconfigurations exist. Also, if \u03c9N is a minimal s-energy configuration, and if \u03c1 is a\nmetric space isometry from S d to S d , then the image of \u03c9N under \u03c1, \u03c1(\u03c9N ), is also a\nminimal s-energy configuration. Minimal (d \u2212 1)-energy points are often referred to as\n\n\"Fekete points\"; see [5]. The determination of minimal s-energy configurations and the\ncorresponding minimal s-energy on S d and other manifolds is an important problem\nthat has applications in many subjects including physics, chemistry, computer science,\nand mathematics. For further background regarding this problem and its applications,\nwe refer readers to the expository papers by Hardin and Saff [13], and by Saff and\nKuijlaars [20]. The papers [6], [9], [12], [14], and [18] and the references therein also\ncontain valuable pertinent information.\nThe determination of the distribution of minimal s-energy points in the cases d \u2265 2\n\nturns out to be rather elusive. It is, however, generally expected that these points are\n\"well-separated\" in the sense that there exists a positive constant Ad,s , depending only\non d and s, such that\nmin |xi \u2212 xj | \u2265 Ad,s N \u22121/d .\ni6=j\n\n(1.2)\n\nDahlberg [5] proved that Fekete points are well-separated. (Dahlberg [5] actually established the well-separatedness of Fekete points on every compact C 1,\u03b1 -surface in Rd+1 ).\nKuijlaars and Saff [14] proved that minimal s-energy points are well-separated for the\ncases s > d. There have been a series of more quantitative results regarding the case\nd = 2, s = 0, which corresponds to the minimal logarithmic energy on S 2 . Rakhmanov,\nSaff, and Zhou [19] first showed that 3/5 is a lower bound for the constant A2,0 in inequality (1.2). Dubickas [8] refined Rakhmanov, Saff, and Zhou's method, and showed\nthat 7/4 is a lower bound for the constant A2,0 in inequality (1.2). Using potential\ntheory and stereographical projection techniques, Dragnev [7] established an appealing\nlower bound for the minimum separation of the minimal logarithmic energy points on\nS 2 to be 2(N \u2212 1)\u22121/2 .\n\nIn this paper, we show that the minimal s-energy points are well-separated for\n\nthe cases d \u2212 1 \u2264 s < d. Note that the case s = d \u2212 1 is already covered by the\naforementioned Dahlberg's result. While the parameter s is restricted in the range\n\nd \u2212 1 \u2264 s < d, the outcome s = 0 can only occur when d = 1, putting the problem\n\n\f3\non the unit circle S 1 . It is shown by G\u00f6tz [10] that the N th roots of unity and their\nrotations are the only minimal s-energy configurations on S 1 ; see also [16]. Therefore in\nthis paper, we can use the tacit assumption that s > 0. Our proof entails comparing the\nRiesz s-potentials on the slightly larger sphere of radius 1 + N \u22121/d of two probability\nmeasures: the rotationally invariant probability measure on S d , and the normalized\ncounting measure on a minimal s-energy configuration \u03c9N . The Riesz s-potential of\nthe rotationally invariant probability measure on S d can be expressed in closed form in\nterms of the Gauss hypergeometric functions 2 F1 (a, b; c; z). The crux of our argument\nis an application of the principle of domination for \u03b1-superharmonic functions; see\n[15]. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the necessary\nnotations and terminologies. Also in Section 2, we list a few formulas pertaining to\nthe hypergeometric functions that we will use in our proofs. In Section 3, we state and\nprove our main result.\n\n2\n\nNotation and terminology.\n\nGiven a minimal s-energy configuration \u03c9N , we use vN to denote the normalized counting measure on \u03c9N , i.e.,\nvN := N\n\n\u22121\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03b4xj ,\n\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03b4xj denotes the unit point mass at xj . The rotationally invariant probability\nmeasure on S d is denoted by \u03bc. For a \u03c3-finite positive Borel measure \u03bb supported on\na compact subset K of Rd+1 , we define its Riesz s-potential Us\u03bb (s > 0) by\nZ\n|x \u2212 y|\u2212s d\u03bb(y).\nUs\u03bb (x) :=\nK\n\nNote that Us\u03bb may take the extended value \u221e on some subsets of Rd+1 . In this paper,\n\nK is either S d or \u03c9N . In the next section, we will show that the Riesz s-potential\n\nof \u03bc can be expressed in closed form in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric functions\n2 F1 (a, b; c; z)\n\ndefined by\n2 F1 (a, b; c; z) :=\n\n\u221e\nX\n(a)n (b)n z n\n\nn=0\n\n(c)n\n\nwhere (a)n is the Pochhammer symbol defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f21,\n(a)n :=\n\uf8f3a(a + 1) * * * (a + n \u2212 1),\n\nn!\n\n,\n\nif\n\nn = 0,\n\nif\n\nn \u2265 1.\n\n\f4\nThere are several sources that provide essential properties of the hypergeometric functions\n\n2 F1 (a, b; c; z)\n\nsuch as Abramowitz et al [1], and Andrews et al [2]. We will be\n\nusing a few basic formulas pertaining to the hypergeometric functions 2 F1 (a, b; c; z),\nwhich can all be found in [1]. We quote them here for easy reference. Under the\nconditions Re (c) > Re (b) > 0, the following formula holds true:\nZ 1\n\u0393(b)\u0393(c \u2212 b)\n(1 \u2212 zu)\u2212a ub\u22121 (1 \u2212 u)c\u2212b\u22121 du =\n2 F1 (a, b; c; z).\n\u0393(c)\n0\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe above integral represents an analytic function in the z-plane cut along the real\naxis from 1 to \u221e. Formula (2.1) is often called Euler's integral representation for the\nhypergeometric function 2 F1 . If Re(c \u2212 a \u2212 b) < 0, then\nlim\n\nz\u21921\u2212\n\n\u0393(c)\u0393(a + b \u2212 c)\n2 F1 (a, b; c; z)\n.\n=\n(1 \u2212 z)c\u2212a\u2212b\n\u0393(a)\u0393(b)\n\n(2.2)\n\nIf Re(c \u2212 a \u2212 b) > 0, then\n2 F1 (a, b; c; 1)\n\n=\n\n\u0393(c)\u0393(c \u2212 a \u2212 b)\n.\n\u0393(c \u2212 a)\u0393(c \u2212 b)\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe following derivative formula can be easily proved by term-by-term differentiation\nin a suitable domain:\nab\nd\n2 F1 (a, b; c; z) =\n2 F1 (a + 1, b + 1; c + 1; z).\ndz\nc\n\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\nMain Result and Proofs.\n\nOn various occasions, we use Cd,s to denote some unspecified positive constants, depending only on d and s. The exact values of Cd,s may be different from proof to\nproof. In the same proof, however, for clarity we use different notations for different\n\u2032 , and C \u2032\u2032 if necessary. Although in the current paper, we do not\nconstants, namely Cd,s\nd,s\n\nstrive to estimate these constants, closed forms for them can be obtained with some\nP\nP\ndevoted calculations. We will be using the notations i6=j , and j:j6=i. The former\ndenotes a \"double sum\", excluding only those terms with i = j. The latter denotes a\n\nsingle sum in which i is fixed, and the summation is done only on j.\nThe following lemma is well-known; see e.g. [14].\nLemma 1.

These topics\ncan be found in Landkof [15]. The definition of \u03b1-superharmonic functions is technical. Upon checking the pertinent material in Landkof [15], one finds the relation\nd + 1 \u2212 \u03b1 = s between the parameter \u03b1 used in Landkof [15] and the parameter s we\n\nuse here. Thus the requirement d\u2212 1 \u2264 s < d translates into 1 < \u03b1 \u2264 2 in Landkof [15].\n\nFurthermore, what is meant in Landkof [15] by an \u03b1-superharmonic function is in fact\n\na (d + 1 \u2212 s)-superharmonic function here in our context. We choose not to use the\n\nphrase (d+ 1\u2212 s)-superharmonic function because we feel that notion \u03b1-superharmonic\nfunction has been coined in the mathematical literature. In Chapter 1, Section 5 of\n[15], it is proved that for a \u03c3-finite Borel measure \u03bb supported on a compact subset\nof Rd+1 , its potential Us\u03bb (0 \u2264 s < d) is an \u03b1-superharmonic function. Furthermore,\n\nTheorem 1.29 in [15], aside from some changes in notation, states the following result:\nTheorem 5. Suppose \u03bb is a \u03c3-finite positive Borel measure supported on a compact\n\nsubset of Rd+1 whose potential Us\u03bb is finite \u03bb-almost everywhere, and that f (x) is an\n\u03b1-superharmonic function. If the inequality\nUs\u03bb (x) \u2264 f (x)\nholds \u03bb-almost everywhere, then it holds everywhere in Rd+1 .\nTheorem 5 is often called the \"principal of domination\" for \u03b1-superharmonic functions.\n\n\f9\nLemma 6.
