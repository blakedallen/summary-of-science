If the reader\nseeks a much more concise treatment of spherical harmonics in an arbitrary\nnumber of dimensions written at a higher level, [5] is recommended.

We will see later (Proposition 2.1)\nthat the Laplace operator is invariant under a rotation of the coordinate system. Thus, it arises in many physical situations in which there exists spherical\nsymmetry, i.e., where physical quantities depend only on the radial distance\nr from some center of symmetry O. For example, the electric potential V in\nfree space is found by solving the Laplace equation,\n\u2206\u03a6 = 0,\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhich is rotationally invariant. Also, in quantum mechanics, the wave function\n\u03c8 of a particle in a central field can be found by solving the time-independent\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n~2\n\u2212\n\u2206 + V (r) \u03c8 = E\u03c8\n(1.4)\n2m\nwhere ~ is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the particle, V (r) is its potential\nenergy, and E is its total energy.\nWe will give a brief introduction to these problems in two and three dimensions to motivate the main subject of this discussion. In doing this, we\nwill get a preview of some of the properties of spherical harmonics - which,\nfor now, we can just think of as some special set of functions - that we will\ndevelop later in the general setting of Rp .\n1\n\nWe may drop the subscript if we want to keep the number of dimensions arbitrary.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n1. Introduction and Motivation\n............................................................................\n\n1.1\n\nSeparation of Variables\n\nTwo-Dimensional Case\nSince we are interested in problems with spherical symmetry, let us rewrite the\nLaplace operator in spherical coordinates, which in R2 are just the ordinary\npolar coordinates2 ,\n\u0010y\u0011\np\n.\n(1.5)\nr = x2 + y 2 , \u03c6 = tan\u22121\nx\nAlternatively,\nx = r cos \u03c6,\n\ny = r sin \u03c6.\n\nUsing the chain rule, we can rewrite the Laplace operator as\n\u22062 =\n\n1 \u2202\n1 \u22022\n\u22022\n+\n+\n.\n\u2202r2 r \u2202r r2 \u2202\u03c62\n\n(1.6)\n\nIn checking this result, perhaps it is easiest to begin with (1.6) and recover\n(1.1). First we compute\n\u2202\n\u2202x \u2202\n\u2202y \u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=\n+\n= cos \u03c6\n+ sin \u03c6 ,\n\u2202r\n\u2202r \u2202x \u2202r \u2202y\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhich implies that\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u22022\n2\n2\n=\ncos\n\u03c6\n+\n2\nsin\n\u03c6\ncos\n\u03c6\n+\nsin\n\u03c6\n,\n\u2202r2\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x\u2202y\n\u2202y 2\nand\n\n\u2202\n\u2202x \u2202\n\u2202y \u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=\n+\n= \u2212r sin \u03c6\n+ r cos \u03c6 ,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6 \u2202x \u2202\u03c6 \u2202y\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\nwhich gives\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u22022\n\u22022\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n=\nr\nsin\n\u03c6\n\u2212\n2r\nsin\n\u03c6\ncos\n\u03c6\n+\nr\ncos\n\u03c6\n.\n\u2202\u03c62\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x\u2202y\n\u2202y 2\nInserting these into (1.6) gives us back (1.1).\nThus, (1.3) becomes\n1 \u22022\u03a6\n\u2202 2 \u03a6 1 \u2202\u03a6\n+\n+\n= 0.\n\u2202r2\nr \u2202r\nr2 \u2202\u03c62\nThe polar angle \u03c6 actually requires a more elaborate definition, since tan\u22121 only produces\nangles in the first and fourth quadrants. However, this detail will not concern us here.\n2\n\n\f1.1. Separation of Variables\n3\n............................................................................\n\nTo solve this equation it is standard to assume that \u03a6(r, \u03c6) = \u03c7(r)Y (\u03c6), where\n\u03c7(r) is a function of r alone and Y (\u03c6) is a function of \u03c6 alone. Then\nY\n\nd2 \u03c7 Y d\u03c7\n\u03c7 d2 Y\n+\n= 0.\n+\ndr2\nr dr\nr2 d\u03c62\n\nMultiplying by r2 /\u03c7Y and rearranging,\nr2 d2 \u03c7\nr d\u03c7\n\u22121 d2 Y\n+\n.\n=\n\u03c7 dr2\n\u03c7 dr\nY d\u03c62\nWe see that a function of r alone (the left side) is equal to a function of \u03c6\nalone (the right side). Since we can vary r without changing \u03c6, i.e., without\nchanging the right side of the above equation, it must be that the left side of\nthe above equation does not vary with r either. This means the left side of the\nabove equation is not really a function of r but a constant. As a consequence,\nthe right side is the same constant. Thus, for some \u2212\u03bb we can write\n\u22121 d2 Y\nr2 d2 \u03c7\nr d\u03c7\n=\n\u2212\u03bb\n=\n+\n.\nY d\u03c62\n\u03c7 dr2\n\u03c7 dr\n\n(1.8)\n\nWe solve Y 00 = \u03bbY to get the linearly independent solutions\n\u221a\n\uf8f1 \u221a\n\u03bb\u03c6 , e\u2212 \u03bb\u03c6\n\uf8f4\ne\nif \u03bb > 0,\n\uf8f2\n1,\n\u03c6\nY (\u03c6) =\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011 if \u03bb = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 sin p|\u03bb|\u03c6 , cos p|\u03bb|\u03c6\nif \u03bb < 0,\nbut we must reject some of these solutions. Since (r0 , \u03c60 ) represents the same\npoint as (r0 , \u03c60 +2\u03c0k) for any k \u2208 Z, we require Y (\u03c6) to have period 2\u03c0.\n\u0010p Thus,\n\u0011\nwe can only accept the linearly independent periodic solutions 1, sin\n|\u03bb|\u03c6 ,\n\u0010p\n\u0011\np\nand cos\n|\u03bb|\u03c6 , where |\u03bb| must be an integer. Then, let us replace \u03bb with\n\u2212m2 and write our linearly independent solutions to Y 00 = \u2212m2 Y as\nY1,n = cos (n\u03c6),\n\nY2,m = sin (m\u03c6),\n\n(1.9)\n\nwhere3 n \u2208 N0 and m \u2208 N. Notice from (1.6) that \u2202 2 /\u2202\u03c62 is the angular\npart of the Laplace operator in two dimensions and that the solutions given in\n(1.9) are eigenfunctions of the \u2202 2 /\u2202\u03c62 operator. We will see in Chapter 4 that\nthe functions in (1.9) are actually spherical harmonics; however, since we have\nnot yet given a definition of a spherical harmonic, for now we will just refer to\nthese as functions Y . The reader should keep in mind that characteristics of\nthe Y 's we comment on here will generalize when we move to Rp .\n3\n\nWe use the notation N = {1, 2, . . . } and N0 = {0, 1, 2, . . . }.\n\n\f4\n1. Introduction and Motivation\n............................................................................\n\nWe can also solve easily for the functions \u03c7(r) that satisfy (1.8), but this\ndoes not concern us here. Let us instead notice a few properties of the functions\nY . Let us consider these to be functions rm sin (m\u03c6), rn cos (n\u03c6) on R2 that\nhave been restricted to the unit circle, where r = 1, and let us analyze the\nextended functions on R2 . We will first rewrite them using Euler's formula,\nei\u03c6 = cos \u03c6 + i sin \u03c6, which implies\n\u0010\n\u0011n\n(x + iy)n = rei\u03c6\n= rn ein\u03c6 = rn [cos (n\u03c6) + i sin (n\u03c6)] ,\n\u0010\n\u0011n\n(x \u2212 iy)n = re\u2212i\u03c6 = rn e\u2212in\u03c6 = rn [cos (n\u03c6) \u2212 i sin (n\u03c6)] ,\nso that\n1\ndef\n[(x + iy)n + (x \u2212 iy)n ] = H1,n (x, y),\n2\n1\ndef\nn\nr sin (n\u03c6) =\n[(x + iy)n \u2212 (x \u2212 iy)n ] = H2,n (x, y).\n2i\n\nrn cos (n\u03c6) =\n\nWe notice that the Y 's can be written as polynomials restricted to the unit\ncircle, where r = 1. Furthermore, observe that\nH1,n (tx, ty) = tn H1,n (x, y),\n\nand H2,n (tx, ty) = tn H2,n (x, y);\n\nwe call polynomials with this property homogeneous of degree n. Moreover,\nthe reader can also check that these polynomials satisfy the Laplace equation\n(1.3), by either using (1.1) or the Laplace operator in polar coordinates (1.6)\nfor the computation, i.e.,\n\u22062 H1,n = 0,\n\nand\n\n\u22062 H2,n = 0.\n\nLet us also notice that the Y 's of different degree are orthogonal over the unit\ncircle, which means\nR 2\u03c0\n0\n\nR 2\u03c0\n0\n\nR 2\u03c0\n0\n\nsin (n\u03c6) sin (m\u03c6) d\u03c6 = 0,\n\nif n 6= m,\n\ncos (n\u03c6) cos (m\u03c6) d\u03c6 = 0,\n\nif n 6= m,\n\nsin (n\u03c6) cos (m\u03c6) d\u03c6 = 0,\n\nif n 6= m,\n\nas we can easily compute by taking advantage of Euler's formula. For instance,\nwe can calculate\nZ2\u03c0\n\nZ2\u03c0\nsin(n\u03c6) sin(m\u03c6) d\u03c6 =\n\n0\n\n0\n\nein\u03c6 \u2212 e\u2212in\u03c6 eim\u03c6 \u2212 e\u2212im\u03c6\n*\nd\u03c6\n2\n2\n\n\f1.1.

The reader can check the rest in a similar fashion.\nFinally, by recalling the theorems of Fourier analysis4 , we know that any\n\"reasonable\" function defined on the unit circle can be expanded in a Fourier\nseries. That is, given a function f : [0, 2\u03c0) \u2192 R satisfying certain conditions\n(that do not concern us in this introduction), we can write\nf (\u03c6) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nm=1\n\nam sin (m\u03c6) +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nbn cos (n\u03c6)\n\nn=0\n\nfor some constants am , bn . We say that the Y 's make up a complete set of\nfunctions over the unit circle, since we can expand any nice function f (\u03c6)\ndefined on [0, 2\u03c0) in terms of them.\nBefore we move on, we will show that (1.4) can be approached using a\nmethod almost identical to the method we used above. Let us assume that\nthe solution \u03c8 to (1.4) can be written as \u03c8(r, \u03c6) = \u03c7(r)Y (\u03c6). Then, using\npolar coordinates, the equation becomes\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n~2 d\n\u03c7\n~2 d2\n~2 d2\n\u2212\n+ V (r) \u03c7 + 2 \u2212\nY = E\u03c7Y.\nY \u2212\n2m dr2 2mr dr\nr\n2m d\u03c62\nMultiplying by r2 /\u03c7Y and rearranging,\n\u0012 2 2 2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nr ~ d\nr~2 d\n1 ~2 d2\n2\n2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ r V (r) \u03c7 \u2212 Er =\nY.\n\u03c7\n2m dr2\n2m dr\nY 2m d\u03c62\nOnce again, we see that a function of r alone is equal to a function of \u03c6 alone,\nand we conclude that both sides of the above equation must be equal to the\nsame constant. Using the same reasoning as before, we write this constant\nas \u2212`2 ~2 /2m, where ` is an integer. If we carry out the calculation, we will\nsee that the functions Y (\u03c6) are the same ones we found previously in this\nsubsection.

The Y 's we will\nfind in three dimensions are more widely used than those in any other number\nof dimensions; however, a thorough development of the functions in R3 could\ntake many pages, and this would distract us from our goal of moving to p\ndimensions. Furthermore, the results that we would find in three dimensions\nare only special cases of more general theorems we will develop later in the\ndiscussion. If the reader is interested in studying the usual spherical harmonics\nof R3 in depth, there are a multitude of sources we can recommend, including\n[1], [2], [3] and [13].\nLet us rewrite the Laplace operator in spherical coordinates, which are\ngiven by\n!\np\n\u0010y\u0011\n2 + y2\np\nx\nr = x2 + y 2 + z 2 , \u03b8 = tan\u22121\n, \u03c6 = tan\u22121\n.

It turns out that the Y 's which satisfy this equation\nare actually spherical harmonics. Comparing (1.11) and (1.12), we see that\nthe Y 's are eigenfunctions of the angular part of the Laplace operator, just\nas in two dimensions. If we studied the functions Y further we would also\nfind that, analogously to what we noticed in R2 , the Y 's form a complete set\nover the unit sphere, each Y is a homogeneous polynomial restricted to the\nunit sphere, and these polynomials satisfy the Laplace equation. However,\nto develop these results and the many others that exist would require us to\nstudy Legendre's equation, Legendre polynomials, and associated Legendre\nfunctions, and we will choose to leave such an in-depth analysis to the general\ncase of p dimensions.\nWe will now move on to see how these functions Y are related to angular\nmomentum in quantum mechanics.\n\n\f8\n1. Introduction and Motivation\n............................................................................\n\n1.2\n\nQuantum Mechanical Angular Momentum\n\nWe have seen that spherical harmonics in two and three dimensions relate to\nthe one-dimensional sphere (circle) and the two-dimensional sphere (surface\nof a regular ball) respectively. In quantum mechanics, rotations of a system\nare generated by the angular momentum operator. Spherical symmetry means\ninvariance under all such rotations. Therefore, a relation between the theory of\nspherical harmonics and the theory of angular momentum is not only expected\nbut is a natural and fundamental result.\nRecall that in classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle is\ndefined by the cross product\n~ = ~r \u00d7 p~,\nL\nwhere p~ is its linear momentum. To find the quantum mechanical angular\nmomentum operator, we make the substitution pi 7\u2192 \u2212i~ \u2202/\u2202xi where x1 = x,\nx2 = y, and x3 = z. Thus, we see that5\n~\u02c6 = \u2212i~ ~r \u00d7 \u2207,\nL\nwhere\n\n\u0012\n\u2207=\n\n\u2202 \u2202 \u2202\n, ,\n\u2202x \u2202y \u2202z\n\n\u0013\n.\n\nTwo-Dimensional Case\nIn the plane, the angular momentum operator has only one component, given\nby\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\nL\u0302 = \u2212i~ x\n\u2212y\n.\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\nUsing the polar coordinates defined in (1.5) and the chain rule, we can rewrite\nthis as\n\u2202\nL\u0302 = \u2212i~ ,\n\u2202\u03c6\nas the reader should have no problem checking using the same strategy s/he\nused to verify (1.6) and (1.11). Then\nL\u03022 = \u2212~2\n\n\u22022\n,\n\u2202\u03c62\n\nand we check using (1.9) that the functions Y (\u03c6) are eigenfunctions of the L\u03022\noperator. In particular,\nL\u03022 Ym,j (\u03c6) = \u2212~2\n5\n\n\u22022\nYm,j = ~2 m2 Ym,j ,\n\u2202\u03c62\n\nThe hat above the angular momentum indicates that it is an operator (not a unit vector)\nin this section.\n\n\f1.2. Quantum Mechanical Angular Momentum\n9\n............................................................................\nand we see that the function Ym,j is associated with the eigenvalue ~2 m2 .\nIn quantum mechanics, operators such as L\u0302 represent dynamical variables.\nIf an operator \u00d4 has eigenfunctions \u03c8k with corresponding eigenvalues \u03bbk ,\nthen a particle in state \u03c8k will be observed to have a value of \u03bbk for the\ndynamical variable \u00d4. Therefore, we see that a particle in the state Ym,j will\nbe observed to have a value of ~2 m2 for its angular momentum squared. We\nsay the function Ym,j carries angular momentum ~m.\n\nThree-Dimensional Case\nThings work similarly in three dimensions, where the angular momentum operator has the components\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\nL\u0302x = \u2212i~ y\n\u2212z\n,\n\u2202z\n\u2202y\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\nL\u0302y = \u2212i~ z\n\u2212x\n,\n\u2202x\n\u2202z\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\nL\u0302z = \u2212i~ x\n\u2212y\n.\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\nUsing the spherical coordinates defined in (1.10) and the chain rule, we\ncan rewrite these as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\nL\u0302x = i~ sin \u03b8\n+ cos \u03c6 cot \u03b8\n,\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\nL\u0302y = \u2212i~ cos \u03b8\n+ sin \u03c6 cot \u03b8\n,\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\nL\u0302z = \u2212i~\n;\n\u2202\u03c6\nthe reader should check these formulas.

Introduction and Motivation\n............................................................................\n\nSo we claim thatpin three dimensions, the function Y` (\u03b8, \u03c6) carries an angular\nmomentum of ~ `(` + 1).\nIn Chapter 4, we will give rigorous foundations to the seemingly coincidental facts we have discovered in this chapter about the functions Y that\narose as solutions to certain differential equations. But first, we will devote a\nchapter to gaining some practice and intuition working in Rp .\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nWorking in p Dimensions\nIn this chapter, we spend some time developing our skills in performing calculations in Rp and exercising our abilities in visualizing a p-dimensional space\nfor an arbitrary natural number p. We will use the majority of the results\nwe obtain here in the development of our main subject, but some topics we\ndiscuss just out of pure interest or to improve our intuition.\nFirst, let us generalize the definition of the Laplace operator to Rp , where\na point1 x is given by the ordered pair (x1 , x2 , . . . , xp ).\nDefinition The Laplace operator in Rp is given by\np\nX\n\u22022\n\u2206p =\n\u2202x2i\ni=1\ndef\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe del operator in Rp is the vector operator\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\ndef\n\u2207p =\n,\n,...,\n.\n\u2202x1 \u2202x2\n\u2202xp\n\n2.1\n\nRotations in Rp\n\nLet us quickly consider orthogonal rotations of the coordinate axes in Rp .\nSuch rotations leave the lengths of vectors unchanged. Indeed, the length of\na vector is a geometric quantity; rotating the coordinate system we use to\ndescribe the vector leaves its length invariant. In fact, in a more abstract\nsetting, we could define a rotation to be any transformation of coordinates\nthat leaves the lengths of vectors unchanged.\nIn what follows, we let x denote a column vector2 (x1 , x2 , . . . , xp )t in Rp\nand use h*, *i to represent the dot product of two vectors. The fact that a\n1\n2\n\nWe will not place vector arrows above points x in Rp .\nThe superscript t denotes the operation of matrix transposition.\n\n11\n\n\f12\n2. Working in p Dimensions\n............................................................................\n\nrotation matrix R leaves the length of x invariant means hRx, Rxi = hx, xi.\nMoreover, since the dot product between any two vectors x, y can be written\nas\n\u0001\n1\nhx, yi = hx + y, x + yi \u2212 hx, xi \u2212 hy, yi ,\n2\nit follows that coordinate rotations leave all dot products invariant.\nNotice further that we can write dot products such as hx, yi as matrix products y t x. In this notation, the requirement that hRx, Ryi = hx, yi translates\ninto the necessity of (Ry)t (Rx) = y t x, or y t Rt Rx = y t x. Since this equation\nmust hold for all x, y \u2208 Rp , we can conclude that any rotation matrix R must\nsatisfy Rt R = I, where I is the identity matrix.\nNow we can verify our claim in the first few sentences of this booklet that\nthe Laplace operator \u2206p remains unchanged after being subjected to a rotation\nof coordinates.\nProposition 2.1 The Laplace operator \u2206p is invariant under coordinate rotations. That is, if R is a rotation matrix and x0 = Rx, then \u22060p = \u2206p ,\ni.e.\n!2\n\u0013\np\np \u0012\nX\nX\n\u2202\n\u2202 2\n=\n.\n\u2202x0j\n\u2202xj\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nProof This can be proved very easily by noticing that \u2206p = \u2207p * \u2207p is a\ndot product of vector operators. Since all dot products are unchanged by\ncoordinate rotations, we can conclude that \u2206p is not affected by any rotation\nR.\nIn case the reader is not satisfied with this quick justification, let us compute \u22060p , the Laplace operator after application of a rotation of coordinates\nR. Since R is a rotation matrix, it is orthogonal, i.e. RRt = I. Then, using\nthe chain rule,\n\" p\n! p\n!#\n\u0013\np \u0012\np\nX\nX \u2202x0 \u2202\nX \u2202x0 \u2202\n\u2202 2 X\nk\n`\n\u2206p =\n=\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xj \u2202x0k\n\u2202xj \u2202x0`\nj=1\nj=1\nk=1\n`=1\n\" p\n! p\n!#\np\nX\nX\nX\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=\nRkj 0\nR`j 0\n,\n\u2202xk\n\u2202x`\nj=1\n\n`=1\n\nk=1\n\nso\n\u2206p =\n\np\nX\nk,`=1\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0013\np\np \u0012\nX\n\u2202 \u2202 \uf8edX\n\u2202 2\nt \uf8f8\nRkj Rj` =\n= \u22060p .\n\u2202x0k \u2202x0`\n\u2202x0k\n\nThis proves the proposition.\n\nj=1\n\nk=1\n\n\f2.2. Spherical Coordinates in p Dimensions\n13\n............................................................................\n\n2.2\n\nSpherical Coordinates in p Dimensions\n\nNow, in order to develop some experience and intuition working in higherdimensional spaces, we will develop the spherical coordinate system for Rp in\nconsiderable detail. In particular, we will use an inductive technique to come\nup with the expression of the spherical coordinates in p dimensions in terms\nof the corresponding Cartesian coordinates.\nWe will let our space have axes denoted x1 , x2 , . . . First, in two dimensions,\nspherical coordinates are just the polar coordinates given in (1.5),\nr =\n\np\n\nx21 + x22\n\n\u2208 [0, \u221e),\n\n\u03c6 = tan\u22121 (x2 /x1 ) \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0),\nwhere r is the distance from the origin and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle3 in the\nplane that measures the rotation around the origin. The inverse transformation is\nx1 = r cos \u03c6 ,\n\nx2 = r sin \u03c6 .\n\nWhen we move to three dimensions we add an axis, naming it x3 , perpendicular to the plane. Now, the polar coordinates above can only define a\nlocation in the plane; thus, they only tell us on which vertical line (i.e., line\nparallel to the x3 -axis) we lie, as we can see in Figure 2.1 with p = 3. To\npinpoint our location on this line, we introduce a new angle \u03b81 . When we also\nredefine r to be the three-dimensional distance from the origin, we have the\nspherical coordinates given in (1.10),\nr\n\n=\n\n\u03c6\n\n=\n\n\u03b81\n\np\nx21 + x22 + x23\n\n\u2208 [0, \u221e),\n\ntan\u22121 (x2 /x1 )\n\u2208 [0, 2\u03c0),\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n\u000e\nx21 + x22 x3\n\u2208 [0, \u03c0].\n= tan\u22121\n\nNow let us imagine moving to four dimensions by adding an axis - name\nit the x4 -axis - perpendicular to the three-dimensional space just discussed.\nThe 3D spherical coordinates given above can only define a location in R3 , so\nthey only tell us on which \"vertical\" line (i.e., line parallel to the x4 -axis) we lie,\nas in Figure 2.1 with p = 4. We thus introduce a new angle \u03b82 to determine the\nlocation on this line. We redefine r to be the four-dimensional distance from\n3\n\nWe keep the definition of \u03c6 sloppy throughout this section. A more precise formula\nwould use a two-argument tan\u22121 function that produces angles on the entire unit circle.\n\n\f14\n2.

We introduce a new angular coordinate \u03b8p\u22122 to determine the\nlocation in the new direction.\n\nthe origin, and this completes the construction of the 4D spherical coordinates,\n\nr\n\n=\n\n\u03c6\n\n=\n\n\u03b81\n\u03b82\n\np\nx21 + x22 + x23 + x24\n\n\u2208 [0, \u221e),\n\ntan\u22121 (x2 /x1 )\n\u2208 [0, 2\u03c0),\n\u0010p\n\u0011\n\u000e\n=\ntan\u22121\nx21 + x22 x3\n\u2208 [0, \u03c0],\n\u0010p\n\u000e \u0011\n= tan\u22121\nx21 + x22 + x23 x4\n\u2208 [0, \u03c0],\n\nwhere it should be clear from the figure that the new angle \u03b82 only ranges\nfrom 0 to \u03c0.\nIn going from three to four dimensions, we mimicked the way in which we\ntransitioned from two to three dimensions. We follow the same procedure each\n\n\f2.2. Spherical Coordinates in p Dimensions\n15\n............................................................................\n\ntime we move up in dimension. For arbitrary p, this yields\nq\nr\n=\nx21 + x22 + * * * + x2p ,\n\u03c6\n\u03b81\n\n= tan\u22121 (x2 /x1 ),\n\u0010p\n\u000e \u0011\nx21 + x22 x3 ,\n= tan\u22121\n..\n.\n\n\u03b8p\u22122 = tan\u22121\n\n. \u0011\n\u0010q\nx21 + x22 + * * * + x2p\u22121 xp ,\n\nwhere the ranges on the coordinates are as expected from the previous cases.\nWe have thus defined the spherical coordinates in p-dimensions in terms of\nthe corresponding Cartesian coordinates. To write down the inverse relations\nwe use projections, with Figure 2.1 as an aid. As before, we will derive these\nrelations in detail for a few instructive cases before writing down the most\ngeneral expressions.\nWe have already written down x1 , x2 in terms of r, \u03c6 so let's use R3 as our\nfirst example. We imagine R3 as the direct sum of a two-dimensional plane R2\nwith the real line R. Then, given the point P in R3 with spherical coordinates\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192 \u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\n(r3 , \u03c6, \u03b81 ), the vector OP can be written as a sum OA + OB, where OA lies\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nalong the x3 -axis and has magnitude r3 cos \u03b81 and OB lies in the plane and\nhas magnitude r2 = r3 sin \u03b81 . The point B thus has spherical coordinates\n(r2 , \u03c6) in the plane, implying\nx1 = r2 cos \u03c6\n\nand x2 = r2 sin \u03c6,\n\nso\nx1 = r3 sin \u03b81 cos \u03c6 ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nx2 = r3 sin \u03b81 sin \u03c6 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nx3 = r3 cos \u03b81 .\n\n(2.4)\n\nLet us examine the situation in R4 using the same technique. Given the\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\npoint P with radial distance r4 from the origin, we decompose OP into two\n\u2212\u2192 \u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2192\nvectors OA+ OB, where OA lies along the x4 -axis and has magnitude r4 cos \u03b82\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nand OB lies in the \"plane\" and has magnitude r3 = r4 sin \u03b82 . The point B\nthus has spherical coordinates (r3 , \u03c6, \u03b81 ) in the three-dimensional space, so\nx1 , x2 , x3 are as in (2.2)\u2013(2.4). Therefore\nx1 = r4 sin \u03b82 sin \u03b81 cos \u03c6 ,\nx2 = r4 sin \u03b82 sin \u03b81 sin \u03c6 ,\nx3 = r4 sin \u03b82 cos \u03b81 ,\nx4 = r4 cos \u03b82 .\n\n\f16\n2. Working in p Dimensions\n............................................................................\n\nIf the reader has understood the previous constructions, the expressions\nin p dimensions should be evident. Given the radius rp in Rp , we project the\nposition vector onto Rp\u22121 , obtaining the radius in the subspace Rp\u22121 given by\nrp\u22121 = rp sin \u03b8p\u22122 . In this way we can perform a series of projections to get\ndown to a space in which we already know the relations. This procedure leads\nto (dropping the subscript on rp )\nx1\nx2\nx3\nx4\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n..\n.\n\nr\nr\nr\nr\n\nsin \u03b8p\u22122\nsin \u03b8p\u22122\nsin \u03b8p\u22122\nsin \u03b8p\u22122\n\nsin \u03b8p\u22123 * * * sin \u03b83\nsin \u03b8p\u22123 * * * sin \u03b83\nsin \u03b8p\u22123 * * * sin \u03b83\nsin \u03b8p\u22123 * * * sin \u03b83\n\nsin \u03b82 sin \u03b81 cos \u03c6,\nsin \u03b82 sin \u03b81 sin \u03c6,\nsin \u03b82 cos \u03b81 ,\ncos \u03b82 ,\n\nxp\u22121 = r sin \u03b8p\u22122 cos \u03b8p\u22123 ,\nxp = r cos \u03b8p\u22122 .\nWith this chapter as an exception, we will rarely referqexplicitly to the\nangles \u03c6, \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8p\u22122 . However, we will frequently use r = x21 + * * * + x2p .\n\n2.3\n\nThe Sphere in Higher Dimensions\n\nWe will give definitions of the sphere and the ball in an arbitrary number of\ndimensions that are analogous to the definitions of the familiar sphere and ball\nwe visualize embedded in R3 .\nDefinition The (p \u2212 1)-sphere of radius \u03b4 centered at x0 is the set\ndef\n\nS\u03b4p\u22121 (x0 ) = {x \u2208 Rp : |x \u2212 x0 | = \u03b4}.\ndef\n\nThe unit (p \u2212 1)-sphere 4 is the set S p\u22121 = S1p\u22121 (0).\nDefinition The open p-ball of radius \u03b4 centered at x0 is the set\ndef\n\nB\u03b4p (x0 ) = {x \u2208 Rp : |x \u2212 x0 | < \u03b4}.\ndef\n\nThe open unit p-ball is the set B p = B1p (0). The closed p-ball is the set\ndef\n\nB\u0304 p = B p \u222a S p\u22121 .\nNotice we call the sphere that we picture embedded in Rp the (p \u2212 1)sphere because it is (p \u2212 1)-dimensional. It requires p \u2212 1 angles to define\none's location on the sphere, as we saw in Section 2.2. However, it requires p\n4\n\nFrequently, we will drop the \"unit,\" though it is still implied.\n\n\f2.3. The Sphere in Higher Dimensions\n17\n............................................................................\n\ncoordinates to locate a point in the ball because we must also specify r; this\njustifies the notation B p . Notice also that the (p \u2212 1)-sphere is the boundary\nof the p-ball when we think of these as subsets of Rp ; we write S p\u22121 = \u2202B p .\nLet us compute the surface area of the (p \u2212 1)-sphere. Towards this goal,\nwe recall that that the gamma function is defined by\nZ\u221e\n\u0393(z) =\n\ne\u2212t tz\u22121 dt,\n\n0\n\nfor any z \u2208 C such that Re(z) > 0. Then\nLemma 2.2 For all p \u2208 C such that Re(p) > 0, we have\n+\u221e\nZ\n1 \u0010p\u0011\n2\ne\u2212r rp\u22121 dr = \u0393\n.\n2\n2\n0\n\nProof Using the substitution u = r2 ,\n+\u221e\n+\u221e\nZ\nZ\nZ\u221e\np\ndr\n1\n1 \u0010p\u0011\n\u2212r2 p\u22121\n\u2212u p\u22121\n,\ne\u2212u u 2 \u22121 du = \u0393\ne r\ndr = e u 2 \u221a =\n2\n2\n2\n2 u\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nas sought.\nProposition 2.3 If \u03a9p\u22121 denotes the solid angle in Rp (equivalent numerically to the surface area of S p\u22121 ), then\n\u03a9p\u22121 =\n\n2\u03c0 p/2\n.\n\u0393(p/2)\n\nBefore proving this we will digress slightly and discuss how the surface area\nof the (p \u2212 1)-sphere relates to the volume of the p-ball. First, consider the\np-ball of radius r centered at the origin. Notice that the radius r completely\ndetermines such a ball. If we were to determine the volume Vp of this p-ball, we\nwould obtain Vp = c rp where c is some constant. Here, we have determined\nthat Vp \u221d rp because Vp must have dimensions of [length]p and the only\nvariable characterizing the p-ball is r (which has dimensions of length). Now\nif we differentiate Vp with respect to r, we get\ndVp\n= (p \u2212 1) c rp\u22121 .\ndr\n\n\f18\n2. Working in p Dimensions\n............................................................................\n\nThus, if the radius of a p-ball changes by an infinitesimal amount \u03b4r, its volume\nwill change by some infinitesimal amount \u03b4Vp , and\n\u03b4Vp = (p \u2212 1) c rp\u22121 \u03b4r.\n\n(2.5)\n\nBut in this case, the small change in volume \u03b4V should equal the surface area\nAp\u22121 (r) of the p-ball multiplied by the small change in radius \u03b4r,\n\u03b4Vp = Ap\u22121 (r) \u03b4r.\n\n(2.6)\n\nFrom (2.5) and (2.6) we see that\nAp\u22121 (r) = (p \u2212 1) c rp\u22121 ,\nand if we let \u03a9p\u22121 = (p \u2212 1) c denote the numerical value of the surface area\nwhen r = 1 (as in the statement of Proposition 2.3), we get5\nAp\u22121 (r) = \u03a9p\u22121 rp\u22121 .\n\n(2.7)\n\nWe see that if we want to carry out an integral over Rp when the integrand\ndepends only on r, we can use the differential volume element\ndVp = Ap\u22121 (r) dr = rp\u22121 \u03a9p\u22121 dr.\nNow we are ready to prove Proposition 2.3.\nProof Consider the integral,\nZ\u221e\nJ=\n\nZ\u221e\ndx2 * * *\n\ndx1\n\u2212\u221e\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\uf8f6p\n\nZ\u221e\n\nJ =\uf8ed\n\n2\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThis is really\n\uf8eb\n\n2\n\n2\n\ndxp e\u2212(x1 +x2 +***+xp ) .\n\n\u2212x2\n\ne\n\n\u221a \u0001p\n\u03c0 .\n\ndx\uf8f8 =\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nUsing spherical coordinates however, we can write\nZ\n\n+\u221e\nZ\n\nJ=\n\ndVp e\nS p\u22121 0\n\n5\n\n\u2212r2\n\nZ\u221e\n= \u03a9p\u22121\n\n2\n\ne\u2212r rp\u22121 dr,\n\n0\n\nWe should stress that, since a physicist assigns physical dimensions to each and every\nquantity, s/he would differentiate between the solid angle \u03a9p\u22121 and the surface area Ap\u22121 of\nthe (p\u22121)-sphere. Although numerically the two quantities are equal for the unit sphere since\nr = 1, they are different quantities since \u03a9p\u22121 is dimensionless while Ap\u22121 has dimensions\nof [length]p\u22121 .\n\n\f2.4. Arc Length in Spherical Coordinates\n19\n............................................................................\n\nsince \u03a9p\u22121 is just a constant. Therefore\n\u03a9p\u22121 = R \u221e\n0\n\n\u03c0 p/2\ne\u2212r2 * rp\u22121 dr\n\nand, with the help of Lemma 2.2 we arrive at the advertised result.\nRemark As a check, we can use this formula to determine the surface area\n(or circumference) of the 1-sphere (or circle) as well as the surface area of the\n2-sphere, which is the familiar sphere that we embed in R3 . As expected,\n\u03a91 = 2\u03c0,\n\n\u03a92 =\n\n2\u03c0 3/2\n= 4\u03c0,\n\u0393(3/2)\n\n\u221a\nusing \u0393(3/2) = \u03c0/2. It is interesting to consider the 0-sphere, i.e., the sphere\nthat we visualize embedded in R. S 0 consists of all points on the real line that\nare unit distance from the origin, so S 0 = {\u22121, 1}. Using Lemma 2.3, we find\n\u221a\n\u03a90 = 2, since \u0393(1/2) = \u03c0. That is, the surface area of just two points on the\nreal line is finite! This is consistent with standard calculus, though. On the\nreal line, the radial distance is the absolute value of x. Hence, the concept of\na function f (r) possessing spherical symmetry coincides with the concept of\nan even function, f (x) = f (\u2212x). Then\n+\u221e\nZ\u221e\nZ\u221e\nZ\nf (x) dx = 2 f (x) dx = f (r) \u03a90 r0 dr.\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2.4\n\n0\n\n0\n\nArc Length in Spherical Coordinates\n\nNow, let us compute the formula for the infinitesimal arc length \u03b4s associated\nwith a small displacement along a curve in Rp . In this section, we use infinitesimals in the physicist's way; that is, \u03b4s and the other small lengths involved\nrepresent tiny displacements that are small enough so that the errors involved\nin our approximations (such as assuming a small portion of a curve is almost\nstraight) are as small as desired (say, less than some given \u000f > 0). We only use\nthe formulas we derive under this assumption in the limit as \u03b4s \u2192 0 and likewise with the other infinitesimal quantities, so our approximations introduce\nno error into future calculations.\nWorking in Rp , let us use the spherical coordinates we developed in Section\n2.2. Consider a point P with coordinates (r, \u03c6, \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8p\u22122 ). Consider a small\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\ndisplacement vector \u03b4~s = P P 0 at the point P in an arbitrary direction. One\ncomponent of this displacement is along the radial direction and has magnitude\n\n\f20\n2.

The other p \u2212 1 components of \u03b4~s are orthogonal to \u03b4~r and thus6 are\nalong the surface Srp\u22121 (0). Thus by the Pythagorean Theorem, we have so far\n\u03b4s2 = \u03b4r2 + * * * where the rest to be filled in involves small changes in the\nangles \u03b8p\u22122 , . . . , \u03b81 , \u03c6.\n\nP\n\nr \u03b4\u03c9\n\n\u03b4~s\n\n1\np\u2212\n\n\u03b4\u03c9p\u22121\n\nO\n\nQ\n\n\u03b4r P 0\n\nFigure 2.2: The plane containing the points O, P, P 0 .

We are familiar with the formula for an infinitesimal\narc length in this two-dimensional plane, namely\n2\n\u03b4s2 = \u03b4r2 + r2 \u03b4\u03c9p\u22121\n,\n\n(2.8)\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nwhere \u03b4\u03c9p\u22121 is the small angle between the vectors OP and OP 0 . Note \u03b4\u03c9p\u22121\nis the angular displacement that occurs along the unit (p \u2212 1)-sphere.\nLet us constrain the displacement \u03b4~s to lie along a sphere by requiring\n\u03b4r = 0. If we compute \u03b4s in this special case, we have found \u03b4\u03c9p\u22121 = \u03b4s/r\nwhich we can plug into (2.8) to obtain the general result.\nWe can determine \u03b4\u03c9p\u22121 inductively, starting in the plane with p = 2. We\n6\n\nThe remaining components of \u03b4~s lie in a surface where \u03b4r = 0 or r = const. This is a\n(p \u2212 1)-sphere.\n\n\f2.5. The Divergence Theorem in Rp\n21\n............................................................................\n\nknow that on the unit circle \u03b4s = r \u03b4\u03c6, so\n\u03b4\u03c912 =\n\n\u03b4s2\n= \u03b4\u03c62 .\nr2\n\nIn R3 , \u03b4~s has a component r \u03b4\u03b81 along the direction of increasing \u03b81 , so that\n= r2 \u03b4\u03b812 or \u03b4\u03c922 = \u03b4\u03b812 + * * * , and the remaining orthogonal components are\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nparallel to the R2 plane. Projecting P P 0 onto R2 , we see that the infinitesimal\ndisplacement lies on a circle of radius sin \u03b81 . Using our result from R2 , we get\n\n\u03b4s2\n\n\u03b4\u03c922 = \u03b4\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 \u03b4\u03c912 = \u03b4\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 \u03b4\u03c62 ,\nthe familiar result in R3 .\nWe can move to R4 in an analogous fashion. An infinitesimal arc length\n\u03b4~s on the 3-sphere has a component r \u03b4\u03b82 along the direction of increasing\n\u03b82 , so that \u03b4s2 = r2 \u03b4\u03b822 or \u03b4\u03c932 = \u03b4\u03b822 + * * * , and the remaining orthogonal\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\ncomponents are parallel to R3 which we picture as a plane.

In this\nlimit, the volume of the uncovered regions of V near \u2202V approaches zero.\nSince F~ is continuously differentiable, it follows that \u2207 * F~ is continuous and\nthus bounded over the closed and bounded region V . Thus, the integral of\n\u2207 * F~ over regions in V not covered by boxes approaches zero. The left side\nof (2.10) therefore becomes\nZ\nXZ\n\u2207 * F~ dp x \u2212\u2192\n\u2207 * F~ dp x\n(2.11)\nQi Q\ni\n\nV\n\nin this limit. Now, in the right side of (2.10), let us consider all the planes\nwhich bound the boxes Qi that are included in the sum. Each \"interior\" plane\nappears twice in the sum, once as the \"right\" side of one box and a second\ntime as the \"left\" side of another box. In each of these appearances, both F~\nand d\u03c3 remain the same but the vector n\u0302 shows up with opposite sign. Thus,\nthe integral over all the interior planes vanishes. The only terms that are not\ncanceled in the integral on the right side ofS (2.10) make up the integral over\nthe \"exterior\" planes, which we write as \u2202 Qi .

To reconcile this\ndifference, we realize that integrating F~ * n\u0302 over a closed surface gives us the\nvolume of fluid that has passed through this\nS surface in unit time.\nS The same\nvolume of fluid must pass through both \u2202 i Qi and \u2202V since \u2202 i Qi \u2192 \u2202V .\nTherefore,\nI\nI\n~\nF * n\u0302 d\u03c3 =\nF~ * n\u0302 d\u03c3.\n\u2202\n\nS\n\ni\n\nQi\n\n\u2202V\n\nCombining this with (2.12) completes the proof.\n\n\f2.6. \u2206p in Spherical Coordinates\n25\n............................................................................\n\n2.6\n\n\u2206p in Spherical Coordinates\n\nTo compute \u2206p in spherical coordinates, we could use the chain rule. This\nwould involve converting all the derivatives with respect to xi in (2.1) to\nderivatives with respect to spherical coordinates as we did for \u22062 and \u22063 in\nSection 1.1. Such an undertaking would be quite messy, however, and adds\nlittle additional insight.\nAnother approach would be to use the general formula from differential\ngeometry\n1\n\u221a\n\u2206 = \u221a \u2202\u03bc gg \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd ,\ng\nwhere g\u03bc\u03bd is the metric tensor of the space of interest, g = det[g\u03bc\u03bd ] and g \u03bc\u03bd\nthe inverse of the metric tensor. Since we have avoided this route thus far, we\nwill not use it here either.\nWe can can actually use an integration trick to determine the form of\nthe p-dimensional Laplace operator \u2206p in spherical coordinates. This is the\napproach followed below.\nD\n\nO\n\n\u03c9\nr\n\u03b4r\nFigure 2.4: A region D in Rp .\n\nConsider the p-dimensional cone-like region depicted in Figure 2.4. Let D\nbe the shaded region (a truncated cone), which has left and right boundaries\np\u22121\ngiven by portions of Srp\u22121 (0) and Sr+\n\u03b4r (0) respectively. We are concerned with\nthe limit where the quantity \u03b4r \u2192 0. This region spans a solid angle of \u03c9,\nwhich means the surface area of the region is a fraction \u03c9/\u03a9p\u22121 of the surface\narea of a complete sphere of the same radius. Using (2.7), this implies that\nthe surface area of the left boundary is \u03c9rp\u22121 while that of the right boundary\nis \u03c9(r + \u03b4r)p\u22121 .\nNow let f : Rp \u2192 R be a twice continuously differentiable function, and\n\n\f26\n2.

In what follows, we will assume the reader\nhas taken an introductory course in linear algebra and, in particular, is familiar\nwith inner product spaces and the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure.\nIf this is not the case, we refer him or her to [4].\n\n3.1\n\nOrthogonality and Expansions\n\nWe will deal with a set P where the members are real polynomials of finite\ndegrees in one variable defined on some interval1 I. With vector addition\ndefined as the usual addition of polynomials and scalar multiplication defined\nas ordinary multiplication by real numbers, it is easy to check that we have,\nso far, a well defined vector space.\nLet us put more structure on this space by adding an inner product. For\nany p, q \u2208 P, define a function h*, *iw : P \u00d7 P \u2192 R by\nZ\ndef\nhp, qiw =\np(x)q(x)w(x) dx,\n(3.1)\nI\n\nwhere w, called a weight function, is some positive function defined on I such\nthat\nZ\nr(x)w(x) dx\nI\n\nexists and is finite for all polynomials r \u2208 P. Notice that, since the product\nof any two polynomials is itself a polynomial, the above requirement ensures\n1\n\nFor now, we allow I to be finite or infinite and open, closed, or neither.\n\n29\n\n\f30\n3. Orthogonal Polynomials\n............................................................................\n\nthe existence of hp, qiw for all polynomials p, q. Moreover, the function (3.1) is\nsymmetric and linear in both arguments and, since w is positive, hr, riw \u2265 0\nfor all polynomials r. Finally, since r2 is continuous for all polynomials r,\nZ\nhr, riw = r(x)2 w(x) dx = 0 if and only if r(x) = 0 for all x \u2208 I.\nI\n\nFor suppose r(x0 ) 6= 0 for some x0 \u2208 I. By continuity, r must not vanish\nin some neighborhood about x0 , and thus the above integral will acquire a\npositive value. Therefore, P together with the function (3.1) is a well defined\ninner product space. We call h*, *iw the inner product with respect to the weight\nw.\nThe reader should recall the following two inequalities that hold in any\ninner product space. We state them here for reference without any proofs\nwhich may be found in [4].\nProposition 3.1 (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality) For any vectors p, q in an\ninner product space P, we have |hp, qi| \u2264 kpkkqk.\nProposition 3.2 (Triangle Inequality)2 For any vectors p, q in an inner\nproduct space P, we have kp + qk \u2264 kpk + kqk.\nNow that we have an inner product space, we can speak of orthogonal polynomials. We call two polynomials p, q orthogonal with respect to the weight3\nw provided hp, qiw = 0.\nSuppose now that we have a basis B = {\u03c6n }\u221e\nn=0 for P consisting of orthogonal polynomials where \u03c6n is of degree n. We can easily see that such a\nbasis exists by beginning with a set of monomials {xn }\u221e\nn=0 and, using the\n:\nWe leave the first\nGram-Schmidt process, to come up with the {\u03c6n }\u221e\nn=0\nmember x0 = 1 of the basis as is. That is, \u03c60 = 1. Then, from the second member x1 = x, we subtract its component along the first member to get\n\u03c61 = x \u2212 hx,1i\nh1,1i * 1, so that the second member of our new basis is orthogonal\nto the first. We continue in this fashion, at each step subtracting from xn its\ncomponents along the first n \u2212 1 orthogonalized basis members. This creates\nan orthogonal basis for P.\nNow since B is a basis, given any polynomial q \u2208 P of degree k we can\nwrite4 , for some scalars cn ,\n\u221e\nX\nq=\ncn \u03c6n ,\n(3.2)\nn=0\n2\n\nThis is also called the Minkowski inequality.\nAlthough the weight function is important, often we tend not to stress it and call the\ntwo polynomials simply orthogonal. We also use the simplified notation h*, *i.\n4\nWe do not need to worry about the convergence of the following series - we will see in\na moment that it is actually a finite sum.\n3\n\n\f3.1. Orthogonality and Expansions\n31\n............................................................................\n\ni.e., we can expand q in terms of the \u03c6n . Since each polynomial \u03c6n in B has\ndegree n, we can clearly write any q in terms of the set Bk = {\u03c6n }kn=0 . Indeed,\nthe space of all polynomials of degree k or less has dimension k + 1, and the\nlinearly independent set Bk has k + 1 elements. Using the uniqueness of the\nexpansion (3.2), we can see that\ncn = 0 for all n > k = deg q.\n\n(3.3)\n\nSince the coefficients are given by\ncn =\n\nhq, \u03c6n i\n,\nh\u03c6n , \u03c6n i\n\nwe have the following result.\nProposition 3.3 Given any polynomial q and any set of orthogonal polynomials {\u03c6n }\u221e\nn=0 , where \u03c6n has degree n,\nZ\nh\u03c6n , qiw = \u03c6n q w dx = 0, for all n > deg q.\nI\n\nSince we will come across expressions of the form hp, pi frequently, let us\ndefine the norm of p with respect to the weight w(x) as\ndef p\nkpkw = hp, piw .\nKeeping in mind the way we constructed our set of orthogonal polynomials\n{\u03c6n }\u221e\nn=0 (requiring \u03c60 to have degree 0 - i.e., requiring \u03c60 to be the constant\npolynomial \u03c60 = a0 - and choosing each successive \u03c6n to be of degree n and\northogonal to the previous n members) the following result should not surprise\nthe reader.\n\u221e\nProposition 3.4 Any two orthogonal bases of polynomials {\u03c6n }\u221e\nn=0 and {\u03c8n }n=0\nfor which deg \u03c6n = deg \u03c8n = n, must be the same up to some nonzero multiplicative factors.\n\nProof Since the {\u03c6n }\u221e\nn=0 constitute a basis, we can write any \u03c8m as, using\n(3.3),\nm\nX\n\u03c8m =\ncn \u03c6n\nn=0\n\nfor some constants cn given by\ncn =\n\n1\nh\u03c8m , \u03c6n i.\nk\u03c6n k2\n\n\f32\n3.

In what follows, we will let kn , `n\ndenote the coefficients of the xn term and the xn\u22121 term in \u03c6n , respectively.\nProposition 3.5 Given any set of orthogonal polynomials B = {\u03c6n }\u221e\nn=0 ,\nwhere \u03c6n has degree n,\n\u03c6n+1 \u2212 (An x + Bn )\u03c6n + Cn \u03c6n\u22121 = 0,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere\nkn+1\nAn =\n,\nkn\n\n\u0012\nBn = An\n\n`n\n`n+1\n\u2212\nkn+1 kn\n\n\u0013\n,\n\nCn =\n\nAn k\u03c6n k2\n,\nAn\u22121 k\u03c6n\u22121 k2\n\n(3.5)\n\nand C0 = 0.\nProof From the formula given for An in (3.5), we see that \u03c6n+1 \u2212An x\u03c6n must\nbe a polynomial of degree n since the leading term of \u03c6n+1 is canceled. Since\nthe set B is a basis, we can thus write\n\u03c6n+1 \u2212 An x\u03c6n =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b3j \u03c6j ,\n\nj=0\n\nusing (3.3). Taking the inner product of each side with \u03c6j 0 , where 0 \u2264 j 0 \u2264 n,\nwe find\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b3j 0 =\nh\u03c6n+1 , \u03c6j 0 i \u2212 An hx\u03c6n , \u03c6j 0 i ,\n2\nk\u03c6j 0 k\nusing the orthogonality of B and the linearity of the inner product. From the\ndefinition of the inner product (3.1), we see that the above equation is the\nsame as\n\u0001\n1\n0 i \u2212 An h\u03c6n , x\u03c6j 0 i .\nh\u03c6\n,\n\u03c6\n\u03b3j 0 =\nn+1\nj\nk\u03c6j 0 k2\nSince j 0 6= n + 1, the first inner product in the above equation vanishes. Since\ndeg (x\u03c6j 0 ) = deg (\u03c6j 0 ) + 1 = j 0 + 1, we can use Proposition 3.3 to determine\n\n\f3.2.

If we\nrename \u03b3n = Bn and \u03b3n\u22121 = \u2212Cn , we have\n\u03c6n+1 \u2212 (An x + Bn )\u03c6n + Cn \u03c6n\u22121 = 0,\nas in (3.4), with\nBn =\n\n\u2212An\nh\u03c6n , x\u03c6n i,\nk\u03c6n k2\n\nCn =\n\nAn\nh\u03c6n , x\u03c6n\u22121 i,\nk\u03c6n\u22121 k2\n\n(3.6)\n\nand it remains to compute the coefficients Bn , Cn . We will start with Cn ,\nrewriting x\u03c6n\u22121 = x(kn\u22121 xn\u22121 + * * * ) as\nkn\u22121\n(kn xn + lower order terms)\nkn\nkn\u22121\n(\u03c6n + lower order terms) .\n=\nkn\n\nkn\u22121 xn + lower order terms =\n\nSince the lower order terms 'die' in the inner product with \u03c6n , (3.6) implies\nCn =\n\nkn\u22121\nAn k\u03c6n k2\n2\nk\u03c6\nk\n=\n,\nn\nk\u03c6n\u22121 k2 kn\nAn\u22121 k\u03c6n\u22121 k2\nAn\n\nas required. We calculate Bn in a similar way, rewriting x\u03c6n = kn xn+1 +\n`n xn + * * * as\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nkn\nkn+1 `n\nn+1\nn\nn\nx\u03c6n =\nkn+1 x\n+ `n+1 x \u2212 `n+1 \u2212\nx + L.O.T.\nkn+1\nkn\n\u0012\n\u0013\nkn\n`n\n`n+1\n=\n\u03c6n+1 +\n\u2212\nkn xn + L.O.T.\nkn+1\nkn kn+1\n\u0012\n\u0013\nkn\n`n+1\n`n\n=\n\u03c6n+1 +\n\u2212\n\u03c6n + L.O.T.\nkn+1\nkn kn+1\nwhere L.O.T. is an acronym which stands for \"lower order terms\".

Orthogonal Polynomials\n............................................................................\n\n3.3\n\nThe Rodrigues Formula\n\nUntil now, we spoke of the arbitrary interval I. For the remainder of our\ndiscussion, we will be most concerned with the interval [\u22121, 1].\nConsider the functions \u03c8n (x) defined on [\u22121, 1] for n = 0, 1, . . . as\n\u0012 \u0013n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nd\n\u03c8n (x) =\nw(x)(1 \u2212 x2 )n .\n(3.7)\nw(x) dx\nFor arbitrary choice of the weight function w, we cannot say whether these\nfunctions are polynomials nor whether they are orthogonal with respect to w.\nIn an effort to force the \u03c8n to be polynomials, we can start by looking at \u03c81\nand requiring it to be a polynomial of degree 1,\n\u03c81 (x) =\n\nw0 (x)\nreq\n(1 \u2212 x2 ) \u2212 2x = ax + b.\nw(x)\n\nThis creates a differential equation, which we can write as\nw0\n(a + 2)x + b\n=\n.\nw\n(1 + x)(1 \u2212 x)\nIntegrating,\nZ\nln w =\n\n(a + 2)x + b\ndx + const.\n(1 + x)(1 \u2212 x)\n\nDecomposing the integrand into partial fractions to compute the integral, we\nfind\na+b+2\nb\u2212a\u22122\nln w = \u2212\nln (1 \u2212 x) +\nln (1 + x) + const.,\n2\n2\nor,\nw(x) = const. \u00d7 (1 \u2212 x)\u03b1 (1 + x)\u03b2 ,\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 are the coefficients from the previous expression. Clearly, the arbitrary constant in the above expression cancels when w(x) is inserted into\n(3.7), so we will take it to be unity. We will also require \u03b1, \u03b2 > \u22121 so that we\ncan integrate any polynomial with respect to this weight. For our purposes,\nwe will see that these restrictions on w(x) are all we need.\nProposition 3.6 Let w(x) = (1 \u2212 x)\u03b1 (1 + x)\u03b2 with \u03b1, \u03b2 > \u22121.

Then, we can write kf \u2212 p\u0303n k2 as\nkf \u2212 pn \u2212 qn k2 = kf \u2212 pn k2 + kqn k2 \u2212 2hf \u2212 pn , qn i.\nBut\nhf \u2212 pn , qn i =\n\nn\nX\n\nbk (hf, \u03c6k i \u2212 hpn , \u03c6k i) = 0,\n\nk=0\n\nsince each term in parentheses vanishes, as we can see from (3.16). Thus, for\nany p\u0303n ,\nkf \u2212 p\u0303n k2 = kf \u2212 pn k2 + kqn k2 > kf \u2212 pn k2 ,\nthe error is greater than that of pn .\n\n\f3.5.

In this\nsection, we will address the question of when such an expansion is possible.\nSince we are concerned primarily with spherical harmonics in an arbitrary\nnumber of dimensions, we will keep the discussion general, making no reference\nhere to the number of variables on which the functions depend. In what follows\nwe will thus let x denote a vector in Rp , D denote a subset of Rp , and d\u03a9 denote\nthe differential volume element of D.\nWe will restrict our attention to the space of square-integrable functions\nwith domain D with respect to the weight w(x), i.e., those functions f : D \u2192 R\nfor which the integral\nZ\nf (x)2 w(x) d\u03a9\n\nD\n\nexists and is finite. When endowed with the usual operations of function\naddition and multiplication by real numbers and paired with the inner product\nZ\nhf, gi = f (x)g(x)w(x) d\u03a9,\nD\n\nthe set of such functions becomes an inner product space. Such a space has\nan induced norm\np\nkf k = hf, f i.\nWe will now work up to a definition of a Hilbert space.\nDefinition In a normed space, a sequence {xn }\u221e\nn=0 is called Cauchy provided\nthat for any \u000f > 0 there exists an N such that\nkxn \u2212 xm k < \u000f for all n, m \u2265 N.\n\n\f42\n3.

To determine each cj , we must\ncompute how many rj 's are produced in the Cauchy product, i.e., in how\nmany different ways we produce an rj in the multiplication.\nNote that this computation is equivalent to asking, \"In how many different ways can we place j indistinguishable balls into p boxes?\" The p boxes\ncorrespond to the p series in the product, and choosing to place k < j balls\ninto a certain box corresponds to choosing the rk term in that series when\ncomputing a term of the Cauchy product.\nLet us use a diagram to assist in this calculation. We will use a vertical\nline to denote a division between two boxes and a dot to denote a ball. Each\nconfiguration of the j balls in p boxes can thus be represented by a string of j\ndots and p \u2212 1 lines (since p boxes require only p \u2212 1 divisions).

The first uses a recursive relation\nobeyed by K(p, n), while the second employs another counting trick.\nProof 1 Let Hn (x1 , x2 , . . . , xp ) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree n in\nits p variables. Notice that Hn is a polynomial in xp of degree at most n. For\nif Hn contained a power of xp greater than n, the polynomial could not be\nhomogenous of degree n, since Hn (. . . , txp ) would contain a power of t greater\nthan n. Thus we can write,\nHn (x1 , x2 , . . . , xp ) =\n\nn\nX\n\nxjp hn\u2212j (x1 , x2 , . . . , xp\u22121 ),\n\n(4.3)\n\nj=0\n\nwhere the hn\u2212j are polynomials. Moreover, notice that the hn\u2212j must be\nhomogeneous of degree n \u2212 j in their p \u2212 1 variables. Indeed, using the homogeneity of Hn ,\ntn\n\nn\nX\n\nxjp hn\u2212j (x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 ) = Hn (tx1 , . . . , txp ) =\n\nj=0\n\nn\nX\n(txp )j hn\u2212j (tx1 , . . . , txp\u22121 ),\nj=0\n\nwhich implies that\nn\nX\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nxjp tn\u2212j hn\u2212j (x1 , . . . , xp\u22121 ) \u2212 hn\u2212j (tx1 , . . . , txp\u22121 ) = 0.\n\nj=0\n\nThe expression in brackets must vanish by the linear independence of the\nxjp . Each hn\u2212j can be written in terms of a basis of K(p\u22121, n\u2212j) homogeneous\n\n\f50\n4.

Comparing this to (4.4) then proves the theorem.\nProof 2 Using reasoning similar to that used in the above proof, we see that\nevery monomial (i.e., product of variables) in an n-th degree homogeneous\npolynomial must be of degree n. For example, a fourth degree homogeneous\npolynomial in the variables x, y can have an x2 y 2 but not an x2 y term.\n\n\f4.1.

But this\nis equivalent to asking, \"In how many ways can we place n indistinguishable\nballs into p boxes?\" The p boxes represent the p variables from which we can\nchoose, and placing j < n balls into a certain box corresponds to choosing to\nraise that variable to the j power.

Spherical Harmonics and Orthogonality\n53\n............................................................................\n\nIn what follows, x will\nq always denote the vector (x1 , x2 , . . . , xp ), r or\n|x| will denote its norm x21 + x22 + * * * + x2p , and \u03be will denote the vector\n(\u03be1 , \u03be2 , . . . , \u03bep ) having unit norm. Keep in mind that x, \u03be represent vectors\nwhile the xj , \u03bej denote their components. Also, Hn will always denote a harmonic homogeneous polynomial. Lastly, in the remainder of this chapter, we\nwill often suppress explicit reference to the number of dimensions in which\nwe work. It should be assumed that we deal with p dimensions unless stated\notherwise.\n\n4.2\n\nSpherical Harmonics and Orthogonality\n\nWe are now ready to introduce the spherical harmonics. First, notice that\nHn (x) = Hn (r\u03be) = rn Hn (\u03be).\n\n(4.7)\n\nIn p-dimensional spherical coordinates, the radial dependence and the angular\ndependence of the functions Hn can be separated.\nDefinition A spherical harmonic of degree n, denoted Yn (\u03be), is a harmonic\nhomogeneous polynomial of degree n in p variables restricted to the unit (p\u22121)sphere. In other words, Yn is the map\nYn : S p\u22121 \u2192 R, given by Yn (\u03be) = Hn (\u03be) for every \u03be \u2208 S p\u22121\nfor some harmonic homogeneous polynomial Hn . We can write Yn = Hn |S p\u22121 .\nIn Chapter 1, we introduced functions Y (which we claimed were spherical\nharmonics) that turned out to be eigenfunctions of the angular part of the\nLaplace operator. Using Proposition 2.5, we can show that spherical harmonics\nare indeed eigenfunctions of \u2206S p\u22121 .\nProposition 4.5\n\u2206S p\u22121 Yn = n(2 \u2212 p \u2212 n)Yn .\n\n(4.8)\n\nProof Let Hn be a harmonic homogeneous polynomial and Yn its associated\nspherical harmonic. As in (4.7), we have Hn (x) = rn Yn (\u03be). Then, using\nProposition 2.5,\n0 = \u2206p (rn Yn ) = n(n \u2212 1)rn\u22122 Yn +\n\np \u2212 1 n\u22121\n1\nnr\nYn + 2 rn \u2206S p\u22121 Yn .\nr\nr\n\nRearranging,\nrn\u22122 [\u2206S p\u22121 Yn + n(n + p \u2212 2)Yn ] = 0,\nwhich implies\n\u2206S p\u22121 Yn = n(2 \u2212 p \u2212 n)Yn ,\nas sought.\n\n\f54\n4.

Referring to (1.13),\n~\u02c6 2 Y` = ~2 `(` + 1)Y` .\nL\nRemark Since the spherical harmonic Yn (\u03be) is defined as the restriction of\nsome Hn (x) to the unit sphere, Yn (\u03be) must also be homogeneous. However,\nYn (t\u03be) is not always defined since the domain of the spherical harmonic is\nS p\u22121 . In fact, it is only defined for |t\u03be| = 1, and since |\u03be| = 1, we see that\nwe can only write Yn (t\u03be) for t = \u00b11. The case t = 1 is trivial, but the case\nt = \u22121 tells us the parity of Yn (\u03be). Since Yn (\u2212\u03be) = (\u22121)n Yn (\u03be), we see that\nthe transformation \u03be 7\u2212\u2192 \u2212\u03be sends Yn 7\u2212\u2192 \u2212Yn if n is odd and leaves Yn\ninvariant if n is even.\nWe now come to the main result of this section, which we hinted at in\nSection 1.1.\nTheorem 4.6 Let Yn (\u03be), Ym (\u03be) be two spherical harmonics.

Spherical Harmonics in p Dimensions\n............................................................................\n\nGiven a set of N (p, n) linearly independent spherical harmonics of degree\nn, we can use the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization procedure to produce an\northonormal set of spherical harmonics, i.e., a set\nZ\nN (p,n)\n{Yn,i (\u03be)}i=1\nwith\nYn,i (\u03be)Yn,j (\u03be) d\u03a9p\u22121 = \u03b4ij ,\n(4.10)\nS p\u22121\n\nwhere\n\n\u001a\n\u03b4ij =\n\n1 if i = j,\n0 if i 6= j,\n\nis the Kronecker delta. For the remainder of this chapter, unless indicated otherwise, we will let Yn,i (\u03be) denote an n-th degree spherical harmonic belonging\nto an orthonormal set of N (p, n) such functions, as in (4.10).\nIn what follows, let R be an orthogonal matrix that acts on \u03be as a rotation\nof coordinates. Notice that since the integration is taken over the entire sphere\nin (4.10), the orthonormal set of spherical harmonics remains orthonormal in\na rotated coordinate frame. That is,\nZ\nYn,i (R\u03be)Yn,j (R\u03be) d\u03a9p\u22121 = \u03b4ij .\n(4.11)\nS p\u22121\n\nProposition 4.7 If Yn (\u03be) is a spherical harmonic of degree n, then Yn0 (\u03be) =\nYn (R\u03be) is also a spherical harmonic of degree n, for any rotation matrix R.\nProof Let Yn (\u03be) be a spherical harmonic of degree n. Then there exists a\nharmonic homogeneous polynomial Hn (x) of degree n such that Yn = Hn |S p\u22121 .\nDenote Hn0 (x) = Hn (Rx). We claim that Yn0 = Hn0 |S p\u22121 . To see this, first\n0\nnotice that Hn0 (x) is a polynomial in xP\n1 , x2 , . . . , xp . Indeed, Hn (x) = Hn (Rx) is\np\na linear combination of powers of the j=1 Rij xj and thus a linear combination\nof powers of the xj . Next, notice that Hn0 is homogeneous of degree n,\nHn0 (tx) = Hn (tRx) = tn Hn (Rx) = tn Hn0 (x).\nFinally, notice that Hn0 is harmonic, by Proposition 2.1. Restricting Hn0 to the\nunit sphere thus gives a spherical harmonic of degree n, Yn0 (\u03be).\nN (p,n)\n\nSince the set {Yn,i (\u03be)}i=1 in (4.10) is a maximal linearly independent set\nof spherical harmonics of degree n, it serves as a basis for all such functions.\nWe have just shown that Yn,j (R\u03be) is a spherical harmonic of degree n provided\nYn,j (\u03be) is as well. Thus, we can write Yn,j (R\u03be) in terms of the basis functions:\nN (p,n)\n\nYn,j (R\u03be) =\n\nX\n`=1\n\nC`j Yn,` (\u03be).\n\n\f4.2.

In fact, this is the\ncase, as shown in the following lemma.\n\n\f58\n4. Spherical Harmonics in p Dimensions\n............................................................................\n\nLemma 4.9 If Fn is defined as in (4.12), then Fn (\u03be, \u03b7) = p(h\u03be, \u03b7i) where p(t)\nis a polynomial.\nProof A rotation of coordinates leaves h\u03be, \u03b7i invariant and, by the above\nlemma, does not change Fn (\u03be, \u03b7) either. For some \u22121 \u2264 t \u2264 1, there exists a\nrotation R that sends\np\nR\n\u03be 7\u2212\u2192 \u03be 0 = (t, 1 \u2212 t2 , 0, . . . , 0),\nR\n\n\u03b7 7\u2212\u2192 \u03b7 0 = (1, 0, . . . , 0).\nTo see this, just rotate coordinates so that \u03b7 points along the x1 -axis. Then\nrotate coordinates around the x1 -axis until the component of \u03be orthogonal to\n\u03b7 points along the x2 -axis.\nNotice that h\u03be, \u03b7i = h\u03be 0 , \u03b7 0 i = t. Since Fn (\u03be, \u03b7) is a sum of products of\nspherical harmonics, which are each polynomials in the components of \u03be or \u03b7,\nFn is a polynomial, say p, in the components of its arguments, i.e.,\np\nFn (\u03be, \u03b7) = Fn (\u03be 0 , \u03b7 0 ) = p(t, 1 \u2212 t2 ).\n(4.13)\nWe can impose another rotation of coordinates, again without changing Fn or\nh\u03be, \u03b7i. Let R\u0303 be the transformation that rotates vectors by \u03c0 radians about\nthe x1 -axis, i.e.,\np\nR\u0303\n\u03be 0 7\u2212\u2192 \u03be 00 = (t, \u2212 1 \u2212 t2 , 0, . . . , 0),\nR\u0303\n\n\u03b7 0 7\u2212\u2192 \u03b7 00 = (1, 0, . . . , 0).\nJust as in (4.13), we conclude that\np\nFn (\u03be, \u03b7) = Fn (\u03be 00 , \u03b7 00 ) = p(t, \u2212 1 \u2212 t2 ).\n(4.14)\n\u221a\nFrom (4.13) and (4.14), we see that 1 \u2212 t2 must appear only with even\npowers in Fn . Thus, Fn is really a polynomial in t and 1 \u2212 t2 , which is just a\npolynomial in t. Since t = h\u03be, \u03b7i, the lemma is proved.\n\n4.3\n\nLegendre Polynomials\n\nTheorem 4.10 Let \u03b7 = (1, 0, . . . , 0) and let Ln (x) be a harmonic homogeneous polynomial of degree n satisfying\n(i) Ln (\u03b7) = 1,\n(ii) Ln (Rx) = Ln (x) for all rotation matrices R such that R\u03b7 = \u03b7.\n\n\f4.3. Legendre Polynomials\n59\n............................................................................\n\nThen Ln (x) is the only harmonic homogeneous polynomial of degree n obeying\nthese properties. In particular, these two properties uniquely determine the\ncorresponding spherical harmonic Ln |S p\u22121 . Moreover, this spherical harmonic\nLn (\u03be) is a polynomial in h\u03be, \u03b7i.\nProof Let \u03be \u2208 S p\u22121 . Then there\nexist \u03bd \u2208 S p\u22121 such that h\u03bd, \u03b7i = 0 and\n\u221a\nt \u2208 [\u22121, 1] such that \u03be = t\u03b7 + 1 \u2212 t2 \u03bd. Notice h\u03be, \u03b7i = t and that\n\u03be22 + * * * + \u03bep2 = 1 \u2212 t2 .\n\n\u03be1 = t,\n\n(4.15)\n\nAs in the proof of Theorem 4.4, we can write\nLn (x) =\n\nn\nX\n\nxj1 hn\u2212j (x2 , x3 , . . . , xp ),\n\n(4.16)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the hn\u2212j are homogeneous polynomials of degree n \u2212 j. Let R be a\nrotation matrix as described in property (ii) in the statement of the theorem.\nWhen R acts on x, it sends\nR\n\nx1 , x2 , . . . , xp 7\u2212\u2192 x1 , x02 , . . . , x0p .\nBy property (ii),\n0 = Ln (x) \u2212 Ln (Rx) =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nxj1 hn\u2212j (x2 , . . . , xp ) \u2212 hn\u2212j (x02 , . . . , x0p ) ,\n\nj=1\n\nand using the linear independence of the xj1 , we see that all the hn\u2212j (x2 , . . . , xp )\nare invariant under the rotationq\nof coordinates R. Thus, these polynomials\nmust depend only on the radius x22 + * * * + x2p , i.e.,\nhn\u2212j (x2 , . . . , xp ) = cn\u2212j\n\n\u0010q\n\u0011n\u2212j\nx22 + * * * + x2p\n,\n\n(4.17)\n\nwhere the cn\u2212j are constants, and cn\u2212j = 0 for all odd n \u2212 j since the hn\u2212j\nmust be polynomials. Property (i) gives us one of these coefficients,\n1 = Ln (\u03b7) = c0\nsince all the x2 , . . . , xp are zero for this vector. Since the form of the hn\u2212j\nis given by (4.17), knowing c0 is enough to determine the rest of the hn\u2212j\nusing the recursive relation (4.6) and the fact that the cn\u2212j are zero for odd\nn \u2212 j. Therefore, Ln as well as the spherical harmonic Ln |S p\u22121 are uniquely\ndetermined by properties (i) and (ii). Finally, using (4.16), (4.17), and (4.15),\nLn (\u03be) =\n\nn\nX\nj=0\nn\u2212j=even\n\n\u03be1j cn\u2212j (\u03be22 + * * * \u03bep2 )(n\u2212j)/2 ,\n\n\f60\n4.

First, from (4.18), we can see that if n is even, Pn contains only even\npowers of t, while if n is odd, Pn contains only odd powers of t. Alternatively,\nwe can see that\nPn (\u2212t) = Pn (h\u2212\u03be, \u03b7i) = Ln (\u2212\u03be) = (\u22121)n Ln (\u03be)\n= (\u22121)n Pn (h\u03be, \u03b7i) = (\u22121)n Pn (t).\n\n(4.19)\n\nEither way, we determine that Pn is even whenever n is even, and Pn is odd\nwhenever n is odd.\nIn the following theorem, we demonstrate how to write the Legendre polynomials in terms of an orthonormal set of spherical harmonics.\nTheorem 4.11 (Addition Theorem for Legendre Polynomials) Let\nN (p,n)\n{Yn,j (\u03be)}j=1 be an orthonormal set of n-th degree spherical harmonics. Then\nthe Legendre polynomial of degree n may be written as\nN (p,n)\n\u03a9p\u22121 X\nPn (h\u03be, \u03b7i) =\nYn,j (\u03be)Yn,j (\u03b7).\nN (p, n)\n\n(4.20)\n\nj=1\n\n2\n\nWe follow the naming convention used in [5] and common in physics. Mathematicians\nusually refer to these as Legendre polynomials only when p = 3 and as ultraspherical polynomials for arbitrary p.\n\n\f4.3. Legendre Polynomials\n61\n............................................................................\n\nProof Since (4.20) is invariant under coordinate rotations, we can choose\n\u03b7 = (1, 0, . . . , 0). Consider again the function Fn (\u03be, \u03b7) defined in (4.12). Since\nwe have already defined the vector \u03b7, we will think of it as a fixed parameter in\nthe function Fn . For now, we will write Fn (\u03be; \u03b7) and think of Fn as a function\nof one vector \u03be.\nFirst, notice that Fn , being a linear combination of spherical harmonics\nYn,j (\u03be) (since we consider the Yn,j (\u03b7) to be constants), is itself a spherical\nharmonic, i.e., the restriction of a harmonic homogeneous polynomial to the\nunit sphere. Next, notice that any rotation of coordinates R that leaves \u03b7\nfixed leaves the function Fn invariant. Indeed, using Lemma 4.8 or Lemma\n4.9,\nF (R\u03be; \u03b7) = F (R\u03be; R\u03b7) = F (\u03be; \u03b7) for all R such that R\u03b7 = \u03b7.\nNotice that in the application of the rotation R, we only rotate the coordinates\nof \u03be in Fn since we consider \u03b7 a fixed parameter, though this made no difference\nin the calculation.\nLet us normalize the function Fn by dividing it by the constant Fn (\u03b7; \u03b7).\nThus, we have found a function Fn (\u03be; \u03b7)/Fn (\u03b7; \u03b7) that obeys all the properties of the Legendre polynomial described in the statement of Theorem 4.10.\nSince, by the same theorem, these properties uniquely define the Legendre\npolynomial, we conclude\nPn (h\u03be, \u03b7i) =\n\nFn (\u03be, \u03b7)\n.\nFn (\u03b7, \u03b7)\n\nTo complete the proof, we will compute Fn (\u03b7, \u03b7). Since, by Lemma 4.9,\nFn (\u03b7, \u03b7) depends only on the inner product h\u03b7, \u03b7i = 1, it is a constant. Thus,\nZ\nFn (\u03b7, \u03b7)\u03a9p\u22121 =\nFn (\u03b7, \u03b7) d\u03a9p\u22121\n\u03b7\u2208S p\u22121\nN (p,n)\n\nZ\n\nX\n\n=\n\u03b7\u2208S p\u22121\nN (p,n)\n\n=\n\nX\nj=1\n\nYn,j (\u03b7)2 d\u03a9p\u22121\n\nj=1\n\nZ\n\nYn,j (\u03b7)2 d\u03a9p\u22121 = N (p, n),\n\n\u03b7\u2208S p\u22121\n\nusing the orthonormality of the n-th degree spherical harmonics.

Spherical Harmonics in p Dimensions\n............................................................................\n\nIn addition, we can expand spherical harmonics in terms of Legendre polynomials. To show this, we will need first the following result.\nLemma 4.12 For any set {Yn,j }kj=1 of k \u2264 N (p, n) linearly independent n-th\ndegree spherical harmonics, there exists a set {\u03b7i }ki=1 of unit vectors such that\nthe k \u00d7 k determinant\nYn,1 (\u03b71 ) Yn,1 (\u03b72 ) * * *\nYn,2 (\u03b71 ) Yn,2 (\u03b72 ) * * *\n..\n..\n..\n.\n.\n.\nYn,k (\u03b71 ) Yn,k (\u03b72 ) * * *\n\nYn,1 (\u03b7k )\nYn,2 (\u03b7k )\n..\n.\n\n(4.21)\n\nYn,k (\u03b7k )\n\nis nonzero.\nProof We will prove the lemma by induction on k. First, consider a linearly\nindependent set {Yn,1 } of one spherical harmonic of degree n. Yn,1 cannot be\nthe zero function. Then, there exists a unit vector, call it \u03b71 , such that the\ndeterminant |Yn,1 (\u03b71 )| = Yn,1 (\u03b71 ) 6= 0. Thus, the lemma holds for the case\nk = 1. Now, suppose the lemma holds for some k = ` \u2212 1 \u2264 N (p, n) \u2212 1, and\nlet {Yn,j }`j=1 be a set of ` \u2264 N (p, n) linearly independent n-th degree spherical\nharmonics. By the induction hypothesis, we can choose a set {\u03b7i }`\u22121\ni=1 of unit\nvectors such that the (` \u2212 1) \u00d7 (` \u2212 1) determinant\n\n\u2206` =\n\nYn,1 (\u03b71 )\nYn,2 (\u03b71 )\n..\n.\n\nYn,1 (\u03b72 )\nYn,2 (\u03b72 )\n..\n.\n\n***\n***\n..\n.\n\nYn,`\u22121 (\u03b71 ) Yn,`\u22121 (\u03b72 ) * * *\n\nYn,1 (\u03b7`\u22121 )\nYn,2 (\u03b7`\u22121 )\n..\n.\n\n6= 0.\n\n(4.22)\n\nYn,`\u22121 (\u03b7`\u22121 )\n\nNow consider the spherical harmonic defined by the ` \u00d7 ` determinant,\n\n\u2206=\n\nYn,1 (\u03b71 )\nYn,2 (\u03b71 )\n..\n.\n\nYn,1 (\u03b72 )\nYn,2 (\u03b72 )\n..\n.\n\n***\n***\n..\n.\n\nYn,`\u22121 (\u03b71 ) Yn,`\u22121 (\u03b72 ) * * *\nYn,` (\u03b71 )\nYn,` (\u03b72 ) * * *\n\nYn,1 (\u03b7`\u22121 )\nYn,2 (\u03b7`\u22121 )\n..\n.\n\nYn,1 (\u03be)\nYn,2 (\u03be)\n..\n.\n\n.\n\n(4.23)\n\nYn,`\u22121 (\u03b7`\u22121 ) Yn,`\u22121 (\u03be)\nYn,` (\u03b7`\u22121 )\nYn,` (\u03be)\n\nIf we compute this determinant by performing a cofactor expansion down the\nlast column and indicating by \u2206j the minor determinant corresponding to\nYn,j (\u03be),\n`\nX\n\u2206=\n(\u22121)`+j \u2206j Yn,j (\u03be),\nj=1\n\n\f4.3. Legendre Polynomials\n63\n............................................................................\n\nwe can see that we will have a linear combination of spherical harmonics\nYn,j (\u03be) which are linearly independent. Thus, for the determinant to vanish\nidentically, all the coefficients of the Yn,j (\u03be) must vanish. But notice that the\ncoefficient of Yn,` (\u03be) is the determinant (4.22) which does not vanish. Thus, the\nspherical harmonic given by the determinant (4.23) is not the zero function;\ni.e., there exists a unit vector \u03be = \u03b7` such that the determinant (4.23) is\nnonzero. Therefore, the lemma holds for the case k = ` and, by induction, for\nall k \u2264 N (p, n).\nTheorem 4.13 For any spherical harmonic Yn (\u03be) of degree n, there exist\ncoefficients ak and unit vectors \u03b7k such that\nN (p,n)\n\nYn (\u03be) =\n\nX\n\nak Pn (h\u03be, \u03b7k i).\n\nk=1\nN (p,n)\n\nProof Let {Yn,j (\u03be)}j=1 be an orthonormal set of n-th degree spherical harmonics, and let Yn (\u03be) be any spherical harmonic of degree n.

Let us choose a set of unit vectors \u03b7j such that the determinant (4.21) with k = N (p, n) is nonzero; this is possible by Lemma 4.12.\nReplacing \u03b7 by \u03b7j in (4.24) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N (p, n) creates the system of equations\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nYn,1 (\u03b71 )\n***\nYn,N (p,n) (\u03b71 )\nPn (h\u03be, \u03b71 i)\nYn,1 (\u03be)\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n***\nYn,N (p,n) (\u03b72 ) \uf8f7\nN (p, n)\uf8ec\n\uf8ec Pn (h\u03be, \u03b72 i) \uf8f7 \uf8ec Yn,1 (\u03b72 )\n\uf8f7\uf8ec Yn,2 (\u03be) \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n..\n.\n..\n.\n.\n..\n..\n..\n\u03a9p\u22121 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8 \uf8ed\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n.\n.\nPn (h\u03be, \u03b7N (p,n) i)\nYn,1 (\u03b7N (p,n) ) * * * Yn,N (p,n) (\u03b7N (p,n) ) Yn,N (p,n) (\u03be)\nThe determinant of the N (p, n) \u00d7 N (p, n) coefficient matrix on the right-hand\nside of this system has nonzero determinant by our choice of the vectors \u03b7j .\nThus, this system is invertible; i.e., there exist coefficients c`,m such that\nN (p,n)\n\nYn,` (\u03be) =\n\nX\n\nc`,m Pn (h\u03be, \u03b7m i), for each 1 \u2264 ` \u2264 N (p, n).\n\n(4.25)\n\nm=1\n\nNow since any spherical harmonic, and in particular Yn (\u03be), can be expanded\nN (p,n)\nin terms of the basis functions {Yn,i (\u03be)}i=1 , there exist coefficients ak such\nthat\nN (p,n)\nX\nYn (\u03be) =\nak Pn (h\u03be, \u03b7k i),\nk=1\n\n\f64\n4.

Let us rewrite the integral in (4.28). Note that the\nintegrand depends only on the inner product h\u03be, \u03b7i and that we integrate \u03be over\nthe surface of the (p \u2212 1)-sphere. We can take advantage of these observations\nto reduce the (p \u2212 1)-dimensional integral to a one-dimensional integral.\nSince we integrate over the entire sphere, we can perform any rotation\nof coordinates without changing the value of the integral. Let us impose a\ncoordinate change R that aligns the unit vector \u03b7 along the xp -axis, which we\nwill picture pointing \"north,\" i.e., take \u03b7 = (0, . . . , 0, 1). If we let t = h\u03be, \u03b7i,\nwe can write the unit vector \u03be as\np\n\u03be = h\u03be, \u03b7i\u03b7 + (\u03be \u2212 h\u03be, \u03b7i\u03b7) = t\u03b7 + 1 \u2212 t2 \u03bd,\nfor some unit vector \u03bd normal to \u03b7. Notice that any such \u03bd gives the same\nvalue for the inner product h\u03be, \u03b7i and thus the same value for the integrand in\n(4.28). Note further that the collection of all such vectors \u03bd,\n{\u03bd \u2208 Rp : |\u03bd| = 1, h\u03bd, \u03b7i = 0},\nforms a parallel of the (p \u2212 1)-sphere which is a (p \u2212 2)-sphere:\n{\u03bd \u2208 Rp : |\u03bd| = 1, \u03bdp = 0} = S p\u22122 .\nA visual representation is depicted in Figure 4.1.\nTo get some intuition, let's think of the familiar 3-dimensional case. The\n2-dimensional sphere can be thought as a sum of infinitesimal rings oriented\nalong the parallels of the sphere. The infinitesimal ring defined by the azimuthal angle \u03b8 has an infinitesimal thickness d\u03b8 and, therefore, it corresponds\nto a solid angle\nd\u03a92 = (2\u03c0 sin \u03b8) d\u03b8.\n\n\f4.3.

In the following theorem, we will see\nthat a maximal linearly independent set of spherical harmonics of all degrees\nis closed and thus complete. This result allows us to develop expansions of\nfunctions as linear combinations of spherical harmonics, which will be useful\nin application to boundary value problems. In what follows, let\nS = {Yn,j : n \u2208 N0 , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N (p, n)},\nbe a maximal set of orthogonal spherical harmonics, and let\nP\nPN (p,n)\nsum \u221e\nn=0\nj=1 .\n\nP\n\nn,j\n\ndenote the\n\nTheorem 4.27 Let the function f : S p\u22121 \u2192 R be continuous. If f is orthogonal to the set S, i.e., if\nZ\nf (\u03be)Yn,j (\u03be) d\u03a9p\u22121 = 0, for all n, j\n\u03be\u2208S p\u22121\n\nthen f is the zero function, i.e.,\nf (\u03be) = 0, for all \u03be \u2208 S p\u22121 .\n\n\f78\n4. Spherical Harmonics in p Dimensions\n............................................................................\n\nThe requirement that f be continuous is actually too strict, and the theorem really applies to all square-integrable functions f , i.e., all f such that\nZ\nf (\u03be)2 d\u03a9p\u22121 < \u221e.\nS p\u22121\n\nHowever, we will only prove the weaker version of this theorem.\nProof We will prove it by contradiction. Suppose that f satisfies the hypotheses of the above theorem, i.e., is continuous and orthogonal to S, but is\nnot the zero function. Then there exists some \u03b7 \u2208 S p\u22121 such that f (\u03b7) 6= 0.\nWe can assume that f (\u03b7) > 0, for if f (\u03b7) is negative we could consider \u2212f\ninstead. By the continuity of f , there is some neighborhood around \u03b7 on the\nsphere where f is positive. That is, there exists a constant s such that f (\u03be) > 0\nwhenever s \u2264 h\u03be, \u03b7i \u2264 1. Define the function\n(\n(1\u2212t)2\n1 \u2212 (1\u2212s)\nif s \u2264 t \u2264 1,\n2\n\u03c8(t) =\n0\nif \u2212 1 \u2264 t \u2264 s.\nFor s \u2264 h\u03be, \u03b7i \u2264 1, the product f (\u03be)\u03c8(h\u03be, \u03b7i) is positive, and it vanishes for all\nother \u03be. Thus,\nZ\nf (\u03be)\u03c8(h\u03be, \u03b7i) d\u03a9p\u22121 c > 0.\n(4.38)\n\u03be\u2208S p\u22121\n\nFor simplicity, we will indicate the above integral by c.

This implies\nZ\nf (\u03be)p(h\u03be, \u03b7i) d\u03a9p\u22121 \u2265 c \u2212 M \u000f \u03a9p\u22121 .\n\u03be\u2208S p\u22121\n\n\f4.4. Boundary Value Problems\n79\n............................................................................\n\nAnd since we can choose \u000f arbitrarily small,\nZ\nf (\u03be)p(h\u03be, \u03b7i) d\u03a9p\u22121 > 0.\n\n(4.39)\n\n\u03be\u2208S p\u22121\n\nFor the remainder of the proof, we fix \u000f and the corresponding p(t) for which\nthis expression is true.\nNow, let m denote the degree of p(t). We can write the polynomial p(t) as\na linear combination of the first m Legendre polynomials since each Pn (t) is\nof degree n; i.e., we can find ck such that\np(t) =\n\nm\nX\n\nck Pk (t).\n\nk=0\n\nWe can thus rewrite the integral in (4.39) as\nZ\nf (\u03be)\n\u03be\u2208S p\u22121\n\nm\nX\n\nck Pk (h\u03be, \u03b7i) d\u03a9p\u22121 .\n\nk=0\n\nBut since the Legendre polynomials are just a special collection of spherical\nharmonics in \u03be, this integral must vanish by hypothesis, contradicting the\nassertion in (4.39). Therefore, our initial assumption that f is not the zero\nfunction must be false.\nSo for any reasonable function f defined on the sphere, we can write\nf (\u03be) =\n\nX\n\ncn,j Yn,j (\u03be).\n\n(4.40)\n\nn,j\n\nTo find cn0 ,j 0 , multiply both sides of this equation by Yn0 j 0 and integrate over\nthe sphere.

Find V in the\nclosed unit ball B\u0304 p , such that\n\u2206p V = 0,\n\nand V = f (\u03be), for all \u03be \u2208 S p\u22121 .\n\n(4.42)\n\n\f80\n4. Spherical Harmonics in p Dimensions\n............................................................................\n\nSolution We know that harmonic homogeneous polynomials are solutions to\nthe Laplace equation, as well as any linear combination of them. We have\nalso seen in (4.7) that we can write each of these polynomials as a power of\nthe radius multiplied by a spherical harmonic. Thus, we can construct the\nsolution to (4.42) as a linear combination of rn Yn,j (\u03be) terms. To satisfy the\nboundary condition, we can use the coefficients in (4.41) to find\nZ\nX\nX\nV =\nrn cn,j Yn,j (\u03be) =\nrn Yn,j (\u03be)\nf (\u03b7)Yn,j (\u03b7) d\u03a9p\u22121 ,\n(4.43)\nn,j\n\nn,j\n\nS p\u22121\n\nthus solving the problem with the solution being in the form of a series.\nIn the next subsection, we will learn to solve this problem by another\nmethod. Since the solution of this boundary-value problem is unique (as we\nknow from the theory of differential equations), we can equate the answers.\nAnd, amazingly, this procedure will give us a generating function for the Legendre polynomials Pn (t).\n\nGreen's Functions\nGiven a differential equation\nDx (f (x)) = 0 ,\nwhere Dx is a differential operator acting on the unknown function f (x), the\ncorresponding Green's function G is defined by the equation\nDx (G(x)) = \u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ) ,\nwhere the function \u03b4 appearing in the right-hand side is the Dirac delta function defined by\n\u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ) = 0, for all x 6= x0 ,\nand\n\nZ\n\n\u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ) dp x = 1, for all \u000f > 0.\n\nB\u000fp (x0 )\n\nLet's assume that the given differential operator is the Laplacian in p\ndimensions, that is, we seek the Green's function which satisfies\n\u2206p G\u0303 = \u03b4(x \u2212 x0 ).\n\n(4.44)\n\nIf we think of G\u0303 as electric potential, then (4.44) describes the electric potential\ncaused by a point charge at x0 \u2208 Rp .\n\n\f4.4.

Boundary Value Problems\n85\n............................................................................\n\nThis concludes our development of spherical harmonics in p dimensions.\nWe have briefly considered an application to boundary value problems; we\nwill not delve further into applications. We have achieved our main goal\nto study the theory of spherical harmonics and the corresponding Legendre\npolynomials in Rp . We urge the reader to seek out applications on his or her\nown. Perhaps search for instances in physics where spherical harmonics are\nused in R3 and try to generalize to p dimensions. One could start with the\nmultipole expansion of an electrostatic field (see [6], [7]) or the wave function\nof an electron in a hydrogenic atom (see [11], [8]).\n\n\f\fBibliography\n[1] G.
