Our numerical simulations show that the Hall insulating regions of the phase\ndiagram can support a sub-phase where the quasiparticle density of states is divergent at zero energy, \u03c1(E) \u223c |E|1/z\u22121 , with a non-universal exponent z > 1, due to the effects of rare configurations\nof disorder (\"Griffiths phase\").\nPACS numbers: 73.43.-f; 73.20.Fz; 75.10.Nr\n\nThe integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) is observed\nin two-dimensional (2d) electron gases in high magnetic\nfields. Its striking manifestation is the quantization of\n2\nthe Hall conductance \u03c3xy in units of eh . Analogs of the\nIQHE are also known in systems with broken time reversal symmetry in which quasiparticle charge conservation is violated because of the presence of a charge condensate, while quasiparticle spin and energy remain conserved. In such a situation the Hall coefficients for spin\nor heat transport can exhibit plateaus at integer values\n2\nin units of ~/2\u03c0 [1] or \u03c0kB\n/3~ [2, 3], respectively. These\nnovel types of quantum Hall effects may be encountered\nin superconducting systems with unconventional (nons-wave) pairing. There has been a great deal of recent\ninterest in these spin and thermal quantum Hall effects\n(SQHE and TQHE) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In particular, the TQHE [9] in systems without spin conservation, which belongs to class D in the Altland-Zirnbauer\nscheme [10], displays many peculiar features that are not\nfound in the IQHE or SQHE, including a metallic phase\nwith a logarithmically diverging density of states (DoS)\n[3, 11]. More generally, behavior of the DoS in unconventional disordered superconductors has attracted a lot\nof research interest recently [12]. A wealth of different\ntypes of low-energy behavior of the DoS was identified,\ndepending on the symmetry of the system and on the\ntype of disorder.\nIn a recent study of the Random Bond Ising model\n(RBIM) (which falls in the same universality class as the\nTQHE systems), Gruzberg et al. [13] conjectured that\nsuch systems may have Hall insulating phases supporting a region where the DoS exhibits a power law singularity \u03c1(E) \u221d |E|\u22121+1/z with a nonuniversal exponent z.\nStrong-disorder renormalization group (RG) calculations\nof Motrunich et al. [14] have also demonstrated the presence of such low E divergence in the DoS (with z > 1) in\nquasi-1d superconductors with broken time reversal and\nspin rotation invariance. This has also been confirmed by\ncalculations using a Fokker-Planck approach [15]. The\nstrong-disorder RG calculations make it apparent that\n\nthe DoS divergence originates in this and in other 1d\nmodels [16] from Griffiths effects [17] involving exponentially rare length l regions (occuring with probability\n\u2032\n\u223c e\u2212c l ) of the sample in 'nearby' phases. An exponentially weak coupling, \u223c e\u2212cl , of defects at the boundaries\nof such rare regions produces a power-law tail in the low\nenergy DoS:\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2032\n(1)\n\u03c1(E) \u223c dl \u03b4 E \u2212 e\u2212cl e\u2212c l \u221d |E|1/z\u22121 ,\n(z=c/c\u2032 and c, c\u2032 are non universal parameters).\nMotrunich et al. further speculated [14, 21] that a similar mechanism driving a divergent DoS may be operative\nalso in 2d superconductors.\nThe presence of such a regime with divergent DoS is\nin sharp contrast to the situation in standard WignerDyson ensembles, where the DoS is never divergent. In\n2d power law divergences generically modified by logarithmic corrections have been known to exist in the chiral symmetry classes [18, 19, 20, 21], where they appear\nin critical phases without exponential localization of the\nwavefunctions. Here, we report an observation of an insulating Griffiths phase with power-law singularities in\nthe DoS of a model (RBIM) in the TQHE universality\nclass. We further demonstrate that the divergent DoS is\ngoverned by a mechanism involving the presence of rare\nlong string defects [22]. Our numerical results thus show\nthat TQHE \u2013 in contrast to its close relatives, the IQHE\nand the SQHE \u2013 does exhibit the conjectured Griffiths\nphase [13, 14].\nFor our numerical simulations we choose a particular\nnetwork realization of the \u00b1J RBIM. As we discuss in the\nend of the paper, our results are however not restricted\nto this model but rather are generally valid for TQHE\nsystems. The RBIM network realization is defined on a\nsquare lattice and has been described in detail before [9].\nParticles traversing the links of the network change direction and turn left or right with probability amplitudes\n\u00b1 cos \u03b1 or \u00b1 sin \u03b1 whenever arriving at a node.

Line segments\nrepresent scans for \u03c1(E) displayed in Figs. 2 (x) and 3 (*).\nIn Fig. 4 scan is along phase boundary from N to Pc .\n\ncorresponding time evolution operator.) Disorder in the\nform of \"vortex pairs\" is introduced by flipping the sign of\nboth cos \u03b1 amplitudes of the node that is dressed by the\nvortex pair. The system is characterized by two parameters: the inter-plaquette coupling strength, tl = sin2 \u03b1\nrelated to the temperature T and coupling constant J\nof the Ising model as tl = cosh\u22122 2J/T , and the concentration of defects, p. Note that although the interplaquette hopping amplitudes are very different from the\nintra-plaquette amplitudes, the underlying spin model\nhas no explicit dimerization in its couplings. Fig. 1 shows\nthe phase diagram of the model. It contains two localized phases corresponding to the ferro- and paramagnetic\nphases of the RBIM. The precise location of the phase\ntransition line (the thermal quantum Hall transition in\nthe fermionic formulation) has been studied in Ref. [25].\nWe also show in Fig. 1 the Nishimori line (NL), where\nthe RBIM possesses some additional symmetry.\nWe construct the time evolution operator U for a single\ntime step for networks with periodic boundary conditions\nand use standard sparse matrix packages to extract a\nnumber of eigenvalues closest to zero [26]. Typically 8\nto 16 eigenvalues per system are calculated. Since U\nis unitary and the network is class D, the eigenvalues\ncome in pairs and are of the form exp(\u00b1iE). We obtain\nthe density of (pseudo)-energies, \u03c1(E), from an average\nover an ensemble of disorder realizations which contains\ntypically of the order of 104 members.\nWe start the presentation of our numerical results with\na scan along the line p = 0.08, as shown in Fig. 1. The\nscan begins in the high-T (paramagnetic) phase where\nthe impact of a small concentration of vortex disorder is\nrelatively weak.

In the absence of disorder, the\nDoS is linear, \u03c1(E) \u221d |E|, at the Ising critical point. In\na disordered system, the theory of Dirac fermions with\na random mass predicts a logarithmic correction to the\nlow-energy behavior, \u03c1(E) \u221d |E| ln |E|\u22121 [11]. Indeed our\ndata for not too high E are consistent with this form, see\nbottom panel of Fig. 2 (at higher energies model-specific\nband structure effects become important). Small deviations from this formula at very low energies can be attributed to finite-size effects, which are particularly pronounced at criticality.\nIf we diminish the inter-plaquette coupling strength so\nas to get close to the NL (still keeping p = 0.08 constant),\nwe witness a qualitative change in the low-energy DoS:\nthe pseudo-gap vanishes and the DoS starts to increase\nwith lowering E, apparently diverging as E \u2192 0. This\nis demonstrated in Fig. 3, where the evolution of DoS\nis shown as tl is lowered from 0.13 down to 0.014. For\nlarge enough inter-plaquette coupling one still notices the\npseudo-gap behavior. The latter is already less evident\nin the data that corresponds to the coupling strength\ntl = 0.07. It finally gives way to a strongly increasing\nbehavior once the coupling falls below tl \u2248 0.05.\nHaving demonstrated the divergence of the DoS in the\nlow-temperature part of the ferromagnetic phase, we turn\nto a discussion of the corresponding mechanism.

Since each defect contains a pair of vortices, such\na string of a length l > 1 (formed with a small but nonzero probability \u223c pl ) produces two vortices with a large\nseparation l.

Upon switching on the coupling tl , the zero\nmodes couple and the degeneracy is lifted. For a small\ntl , the energy splitting E thus produced will be exponentially small in l [23]. For a clean system (which contains\nonly two vortices at the ends of the string but no other\ndefects) this follows immediately from the perturbation\nl/2\ntheory, yielding E \u221d tl = e\u2212cl . Clearly, the same result\nholds for those rare configurations of the disordered system for which the region of a size \u223c l around the vortex\npair is free of other vortices. However, the probability\nd\nfor this to happen scales with l as (1 \u2212 p)l , where d = 2\nis the spatial dimensionality. In the 1d case this factor\nis harmless, yielding the probability for formation of an\n\u2032\nisolated string \u221d e\u2212c l with c\u2032 = \u2212 ln p(1 \u2212 p)2 and Eq. 1\napplies. On the other hand, in d = 2 the above factor\nseems to spoil the reasoning leading to Eq. (1). So, if\nthe requirement of \"isolation\" of the vortex pair would\nbe a necessary condition for the appearance of exponentially small eigenvalues, \u01eb \u223c e\u2212cl , the divergent behavior\nof the DoS would be converted to a pseudo-gap at lowest\nd\nenergies due to the (1 \u2212 p)l factor.\nWe now argue that this requirement is not necessary,\nand Eq. (1) is applicable in 2d as well. Indeed, at small\np almost all randomly located defects will be isolated.\nCorrespondingly, \u2243 p is the concentration of vortex pairs\n1/2\nwith separation unity and an energy splitting \u223c tl .\n2\nThere will be a much smaller concentration (p ) of defects forming chains of length two, yielding the energy\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n20\n\nl\n\n40\n\n60\n\nno string\nl=8\nl=16\nl=24\nl=32\nl=40\nl=48\nl=56\n\n\u22122\n\n\u221245\n\n\u221235\n\n\u221225\n\n\u221215\n\nlog(\u03b5)\n\nFIG. 4: Distribution of logarithm of lowest eigenvalue for\nstring of defects of length l = 8 \u00f7 56 inserted in disordered\nsystem in ferromagnetic phase (p = 0.08, tl = 0.029, L =\n128). Inset: typical lowest eigenvalue as a function of l.\n\nsplitting \u223c tl , and so forth. the energy splitting associated with these short (compared to l) vortices will\nbe relatively big, and will only weakly affect the energy\nsplitting tl/2 of the l-vortex. This argument can be converted to a RG procedure, as in [14, 21]. The vortices\ncan be sorted into vortex pairs by combining those with\nthe shortest distance first, the second shortest distance\nnext, etc. Since the energy splitting associated with the\ncoupling of two vortices is exponential in their distance,\nvortex pairs differing in this distance will strongly differ\nin their splitting as well. The hierarchical order allows\nfor a RG procedure that successively eliminates vortex\npairs with an energy splitting that is large as compared\nto the pairs remaining on the lattice. Clearly, for sufficiently small tl and p (the boundary of the Griffiths phase\nwill be discussed below) the eigenvalues associated with\nlong strings, i.e. vortex pairs with a large separation, are\n(largely) insensitive to the presence of other vortex pairs.\nIn other words, a string of length l does not have to be\nisolated in order to contribute an eigenvalue \u223c e\u2212cl . The\nonly role of other (randomly distributed) vortices will be\nin somewhat modifying the parameter c as compared to\nits value c = \u2212 21 ln tl for an isolated string.\nSince the validity of the above RG-type argument is\ncrucial for the proposed string mechanism, we have performed a numerical test for its verification. We have inserted a string of the length l (ranging from 8 to 56) into\na disordered network with tl = 0.029 and p = 0.08. Fig.\n4 displays the evolution of the distribution of the lowest\neigenvalue with increasing length of the string. The results fully confirm our scenario: a) the extra string gives\nrise to an additional, isolated eigenvalue; b) this eigenvalue moves with increasing l according to the expected\nexponential law, h\u2212 ln \u01ebi \u221d l, see inset of Fig. 4 (the\nrest of the spectrum does not move).

Our numerical work is based on the network representation of the \u00b1J random bond Ising model.\nPreliminary results for the more generic Cho-Fisher [29]\nmodel confirm that a similar phase exists also there, so\nthat the Griffiths phase is a ubiquitous companion of the\nTQHE.\nWe\nacknowledge\nvaluable\ndiscussions\nwith\nJ.T.

DoS shows powerlaw divergence, \u03c1(E) \u223c |E|1/z\u22121 , with non-universal exponent z. At low energies random-matrix oscillations indicate existence of delocalized (critical) states. Plots with\ntl = 0.058, 0.044, 0.029 (from top to bottom); each for three\nvalues of system size: L = 64, 128, 256.\n\ntl = 0.029) and found that the distribution does not move\nwith l: a long string of defects in a random environment\ndoes not generate an exponentially small eigenvalue.\nTherefore, the analytical arguments together with the\nnumerical results, Figs. 3 and 4, demonstrate the existence of a Griffiths phase where string formation generates a divergent DoS, Eq. (1) with z > 1. This phase\nis shaded in the phase diagram, Fig. 1. Its boundary\non the side of larger tl is given by the condition z = 1\nand, according to our numerical results, is at least close\nto the NL. The asymptotic behavior of the boundary at\nlow temperature and weak disorder can be easily found\nfrom our analytical considerations. Indeed, in this limit\nc \u2243 \u2212 12 ln tl \u2243 2J/T , and c\u2032 = \u2212 ln p, so that the condition z = c/c\u2032 = 1 reduces to ln p \u2243 \u22122J/T . This agrees\nwith the low-temperature asymptotics of the NL, whose\nexact form is e2J/T = p/(1 \u2212 p). It is thus plausible that\nthe boundary of the Griffiths phase with divergent DoS\nin fact coincides with the NL as was conjectured in [13].\nThe boundary at large disorder is set by the phase\ntransition line into the paramagnetic phase, where the\nstring mechanism ceases to be operative. Indeed, our\nnumerics indicates pseudogap formation everywhere in\nthe paramagnetic phase. Right at this part of the phase\nboundary (between the Nishimori point N and the percolation critical point Pc ), we find a divergent DoS with\na non-universal exponent z, Fig. 5. While we do not\nhave at present an analytical theory for this behavior of\nDoS at criticality, an analogy with the random phase XY\nmodel, which has a phase diagram remarkably similar to\nFig. 1, with a low-T part of the phase diagram requiring a\nstrong-disorder RG treatment, [24] might be instructive.\nIn conclusion, we have reported the observation of a\nnovel type of insulating phase for 2d electron systems\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n\n[23]\n\nAlso at Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, 188350\nSt. Petersburg, Russia.\nPreviously at Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Rice University, Houston, TX 770 005\nT.
