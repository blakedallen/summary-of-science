We study full exact functors between triangulated categories. With some hypotheses\non the source category we prove that it admits an orthogonal decomposition into two pieces such\nthat the functor restricted to one of them is zero while the restriction to the other is faithful. In\nparticular, if the source category is either the category of perfect complexes or the bounded derived\ncategory of coherent sheaves on a noetherian scheme supported on a closed connected subscheme,\nthen any non-trivial exact full functor is faithful as well. Finally we show that removing the\nnoetherian hypothesis this result is not true.\n\n1. Introduction\nFor an exact functor F : T1 \u2192 T2 between triangulated categories there is a list of properties that, from a purely categorical point of view, are completely unrelated or not automatically\nsatisfied. Among them we can mention: the existence of adjoints, fullness, faithfulness and essential surjectivity. Nevertheless, as soon as Ti has a geometric nature, these properties and their\nrelations can be studied in a more efficient and complete way.\nFor example, if Ti is the bounded derived category Db (Xi ) of coherent sheaves on a complex\nsmooth projective variety Xi , then any exact functor F : Db (X1 ) \u2192 Db (X2 ) has always a left\nand a right adjoint, by a result of Bondal and Van den Bergh [3]. This, combined with [9], says\nthat if F is fully faithful, then it is of Fourier\u2013Mukai type, i.e. there is E \u2208 Db (X1 \u00d7 X2 ) and an\nisomorphism of functors F \u223c\n= \u03a6E , where \u03a6E : Db (X1 ) \u2192 Db (X2 ) is the exact functor defined by\nL\n\n\u03a6E := R(p2 )\u2217 (E \u2297 p\u22171 (\u2212)),\nand pi : X1 \u00d7 X2 \u2192 Xi is the natural projection.\nNow [2] and [4] provide a very useful criterion to establish when a Fourier\u2013Mukai functor\n\u03a6E : Db (X1 ) \u2192 Db (X2 ) is fully faithful. Namely \u03a6E is such if and only if\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2C if x = x and i = 0\n1\n2\nHomDb (X2 ) (\u03a6E (Ox1 ), \u03a6E (Ox2 )[i]) \u223c\n=\n\uf8f30 if x1 6= x2 or i 6\u2208 [0, dim X1 ]\n\nfor all closed points x1 , x2 \u2208 X1 .\nOf course, it is quite easy to construct examples of faithful functors which are not full (e.g. the\ntensorization by a vector bundle of rank greater than 1).

Here we give a sketch of the proof, since a more\ngeneral statement will be proved in the paper. Firstly, by the main result of [5] (which improves\n[9]), F is a Fourier\u2013Mukai functor. Thus, because of the above criterion and the fact that F is\nfull, to show that the functor is also faithful it is enough to prove that there are no closed points\nx \u2208 X1 such that Hom(F(Ox ), F(Ox )) = 0 or, in other words, such that F(Ox ) \u223c\n= 0. To see\nb\nb\nthis, take the left adjoint G : D (X2 ) \u2192 D (X1 ) of F and consider the composition G \u25e6 F which\nis again a Fourier\u2013Mukai functor, hence isomorphic to \u03a6E for some E \u2208 Db (X1 \u00d7 X1 ). Assume\nthat there are x1 , x2 \u2208 X1 such that F(Ox1 ) 6\u223c\n= 0 while F(Ox2 ) \u223c\n= 0. By [2] (see, in particular,\nProposition 1.5 there) the Chern character ch(\u03a6E (Ox1 )) is not zero. On the other hand, it is\n\u2217\n\u2217\nproved in [9] that the functor \u03a6E induces a morphism \u03a6H\nE : H (X1 , Q) \u2192 H (X1 , Q) such that\np\np\np\ntd(X1 )) = \u03a6H\ntd(X1 )) = 0.\n0 6= ch(\u03a6E (Ox1 )) * td(X2 ) = \u03a6H\nE (ch(Ox1 ) *\nE (ch(Ox2 ) *\nThis contradiction proves that, if F were not faithful, then F(Ox ) \u223c\n= 0 for every closed point\n\u223c\nx \u2208 X. But this would easily imply that F = 0, against the assumption.\nThis paper is an attempt to understand to which extent the previous easy example can be pushed.\nIn particular, we want to study when the following question may have a positive answer:\nWhen is a full exact functor between 'geometric triangulated categories' faithful?\nIt is rather obvious that one can produce examples of full non-trivial exact functors which are not\nfaithful if one does not require the source triangulated category to be indecomposable. However,\nsomething interesting can be said even without this hypothesis. In fact, after proving a very general\nstatement in Section 2, our first important (and still rather general) result, whose proof is in Section\n3, is the following.\nTheorem 1.1. Let T1 be a triangulated category with arbitrary direct sums that is compactly\ngenerated and let Tc1 be the subcategory of compact objects. Let S \u2282 Tc1 be a subset of compact\nobjects and let S \u2286 Tc1 be the thick subcategory generated by S. Let\nF : S \u2212\u2192 T2\nbe a full exact functor to a triangulated category T2 . Assume that for any object A \u2208 S the ring of\nendomorphisms EndT1 (A) is idempotent noetherian. Then there is an orthogonal decomposition\nS = (ker F)\u22a5 \u2295 ker F\nand F|(ker F)\u22a5 is faithful.\nSee Definition 3.1 for the notion of idempotent noetherian ring. As it will turn out, the ring of\nendomorphisms of an object in the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a noetherian\nscheme has this property (see Proposition 4.3).\nNotice that if in Theorem 1.1 we assume S to be indecomposable and F to be non-trivial, then\nwe can conclude that F is actually faithful. So in the geometric case we consider a noetherian\nscheme X containing a closed connected subscheme Z and we assume that S is either the\nbounded derived category DbZ (X) of coherent sheaves on X supported on Z or the subcategory\nPerf Z (X) \u2286 DbZ (X) consisting of perfect complexes. Recall that a complex in DbZ (X) is perfect\n\n\fDOES FULL IMPLY FAITHFUL?\n\n3\n\nif it is locally quasi-isomorphic to a complex of locally free sheaves of finite type on X. Due to\nCorollary 4.6, these categories are indecomposable, and we get the following result which we prove\nin Section 4.\nTheorem 1.2. Let X be a noetherian scheme containing a closed subscheme Z and let S be\neither Perf Z (X) or DbZ (X). Let T be a triangulated category and let\nF : S \u2212\u2192 T\nbe a full exact functor which is not isomorphic to the zero functor. If Z is connected, then F is\nalso faithful.\nIn Section 5 we show that if we do not assume X to be noetherian, then the above result\ndoes not necessarily hold true. Indeed, we give an example of a non-noetherian (affine) scheme\nX over a field k such that Perf (X) is indecomposable and of a full non-trivial exact functor\nF : Perf (X) \u2192 D(k) to the (unbounded) derived category of k -vector spaces which is not faithful.\n2. A general result\nIf F : A \u2192 B is an additive functor between additive categories, we will denote by ker F the\n(strictly) full subcategory of A having as objects the A such that F(A) \u223c\n= 0, and by im F the\n(strictly) full subcategory of B having as objects the B such that B \u223c\n= F(A) for some A \u2208 A.\nNotice that ker F is a (thick) triangulated subcategory of A if A and B are triangulated and\nF is exact.\nFor the convenience of the reader we recall the proof of the following lemma which is known to\nexperts and, for example, is contained in the proof of [10, Thm. 3.9].\nLemma 2.1. Let T1 and T2 be triangulated categories and let F : T1 \u2192 T2 be a full exact\nfunctor such that ker F \u223c\n= 0. Then F is faithful.\nProof. Assume that there are A, B \u2208 T1 and f : A \u2192 B a morphism such that F(f ) = 0.\nComplete the morphism to a distinguished triangle\nA\n\nf\n\n/B\n\ng\n\n/ C(f )\n\nso that, applying the functor F, we get the distinguished triangle\nF(A)\n\nF(f )=0\n\n/ F(B)\n\nF(g)\n\n/ F(C(f )).\n\nThen id : F(B) \u2192 F(B) factors through F(g) : F(B) \u2192 F(C(f )).\nAs F is full, there exists a morphism h : B \u2192 B factoring through g and such that F(h) = id.\nThen F(C(h)) \u223c\n= C(F(h)) \u223c\n= 0. Since ker F \u223c\n= 0, we get C(h) \u223c\n= 0 and h is an isomorphism.\nThis implies that g is a (split) monomorphism. In particular f = 0, and so F is faithful. \u0003\nDefinition 2.2. An orthogonal decomposition T = T1 \u2295 T2 of a triangulated category T is\ngiven by two full triangulated subcategories T1 and T2 satisfying the following conditions:\n(1) T1 and T2 are completely orthogonal, meaning that Hom(A1 , A2 ) = Hom(A2 , A1 ) = 0\nfor every objects Ai of Ti ;\n(2) For every object A of T there exist objects Ai of Ti such that A \u223c\n= A1 \u2295 A2 .\n\n\f4\n\nALBERTO CANONACO, DMITRI ORLOV, AND PAOLO STELLARI\n\nA triangulated category is indecomposable if it admits only trivial orthogonal decompositions.\nWe begin with the following general result.\nProposition 2.3. Let T1 and T2 be triangulated categories and let F : T1 \u2192 T2 be a full\nexact functor. Assume moreover that the projection functor \u03c0 : T1 \u2192 T1 / ker F has an adjoint\n\u03bc : T1 / ker F \u2192 T1 . Then the category T1 has an orthogonal decomposition of the form\nT1 = im \u03bc \u2295 ker F\nand F|im \u03bc is faithful. In particular, if T1 is indecomposable and F is not isomorphic to 0,\nthen F is faithful.\nProof. Passing, if necessary, to the opposed functor of F (defined as F, but between the opposed\ncategories), we can assume that \u03bc is a right adjoint of \u03c0.\nNow, given A \u2208 T1 and using the adjunction between \u03bc and \u03c0, we get the distinguished\ntriangle\nA\n\nmA\n\n/ \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A)\n\nnA\n\n/ NA .\n\nThe functor F induces in a natural way a functor F\u2032 : T1 / ker F \u2192 T2 which is fully faithful due\nto Lemma 2.1. Hence, for all A, B \u2208 T1 ,\nHom(B, \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A)) \u223c\n= Hom(\u03c0(B), \u03c0(A)) \u223c\n= Hom(F\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c0(B), F\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c0(A)) = Hom(F(B), F(A)).\nAs F = F\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c0 is full, this implies that the morphism\nHom(B, A) \u2212\u2192 Hom(B, \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A))\ngiven by the composition with mA is surjective for all A, B \u2208 T1 . In particular, the map\n\u03c6A,B : Hom(B, \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A)) \u2212\u2192 Hom(B, NA ),\nobtained composing with nA , is zero. Taking B = \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A) in the above argument, we get\n\u03c6A,B (id) = nA = 0. This means that, for any A \u2208 T1 , there is a decomposition\nA\u223c\n= \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A) \u2295 NA [\u22121].\nBy [8, Lemma 9.1.7] the functor \u03bc as adjoint to a projection functor is fully faithful, i.e.\n\u03c0\u25e6\u03bc \u223c\n= id. Therefore, the functor \u03c0 induces an equivalence between im \u03bc and the quotient\nT1 / ker F. Since F\u2032 is faithful, the functor F|im \u03bc is faithful too.\nMoreover, since \u03bc is fully faithful the map \u03c0(mA ) is an isomorphism. This implies that\n\u03c0(NA ) \u223c\n= C(\u03c0(mA )) \u223c\n= 0. In order to get the orthogonal decomposition, it remains to show that\nker F and im \u03bc = im(\u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0) are orthogonal. By adjunction, it is obvious that Hom(A, B) = 0 if\nA \u2208 ker F and B \u2208 im \u03bc. For the other direction, assume that there is a morphism f : \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A) \u2192\nB, for some A \u2208 T1 and B \u2208 ker F. Consider the distinguished triangle\n\u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A)\n\nf\n\n/B\n\n/ C(f )\n\nand apply the functor \u03c0 getting\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A)\n\n\u03c0(f )\n\n/ \u03c0(B)\n\n/ \u03c0(C(f )).\n\n\fDOES FULL IMPLY FAITHFUL?\n\n5\n\nThus \u03c0(C(f )[\u22121]) \u223c\n= \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A) \u223c\n= \u03c0(A) and \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(C(f )[\u22121]) \u223c\n= \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A). Moreover the map\nC(f )[\u22121] \u2192 \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A) can be identified with the canonical map C(f )[\u22121] \u2192 \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(C(f )[\u22121]).\nAs C(f ) \u2208 T1 , the calculations above yield that the map C(f )[\u22121] \u2192 \u03bc\u25e6\u03c0(C(f )[\u22121]) \u223c\n= \u03bc\u25e6\u03c0(A)\nis an epimorphism, and so f = 0. This is what we need to prove.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.4. It is well-known that every exact functor from T1 has a right (respectively left)\nadjoint if T1 is right (respectively left) saturated (see [3]).\nRemark 2.5. Assume that T1 and T2 are triangulated categories and let F : T1 \u2192 T2 be a\nfull exact functor admitting a pseudo-adjoint G : T2 \u2192 T\u03031 such that im(G \u25e6 F) \u2286 T1 . Then \u03c0\nhas an adjoint which is simply G \u25e6 F\u2032 (where F\u2032 : T1 / ker F \u2192 T2 is defined in the above proof).\nHence Proposition 2.3 applies.\nWith a left (respectively right) pseudo-adjoint of a functor F : C \u2192 C\u2032 we mean a functor\nG : C\u2032 \u2192 C\u0303, where C\u0303 is some category containing C as a full subcategory, together with\na natural isomorphism HomC\u2032 (A\u2032 , F(A)) \u223c\n= HomC\u0303 (G(A\u2032 ), A) (respectively HomC\u2032 (F(A), A\u2032 ) \u223c\n=\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nHomC\u0303 (A, G(A )) ) for all objects A of C and A of C .\n3. The categorical case\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1.1 and show how to apply it to subcategories of noetherian\nobjects. For this purpose we introduce the notion of an idempotent noetherian ring.\n3.1. General setting. We will be interested in the following special class of rings appearing naturally in geometric situations.\nDefinition 3.1. A ring R is (right) idempotent noetherian if for every sequence {ai }i\u2208N of\nelements in R satisfying\n(3.1)\n\naj ai = ai\n\nfor all i < j\n\nthere exists a positive integer n such that ai R = an R for all i \u2265 n.\nAnalogously, one can define left idempotent noetherian rings. As this notion will not be needed in\nthe rest of the paper, right idempotent noetherian rings will simply be called idempotent noetherian.\nRemark 3.2. If {ai }i\u2208N is a sequence in a ring R satisfying (3.1) and such that ai R = an R\nfor i \u2265 n, then ai is idempotent for i > n. Indeed, there exists r \u2208 R such that ai = ai\u22121 r,\nhence\nai ai = ai ai\u22121 r = ai\u22121 r = ai .\nWe begin with the following easy result.\nLemma 3.3. If A is an additive category and A \u2208 A is such that EndA (A) is idempotent\nnoetherian, then A is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of indecomposable objects.\nProof. Assume on the contrary that A is not isomorphic to a finite direct sum of indecomposable\nobjects. Then there exists a sequence {Ai }i\u2208N of non-trivial objects of A such that, for all\nLn\nn \u2208 N, the object Bn :=\nj=0 Aj is a direct summand of A. Thus, for all j \u2208 N set\naj \u2208 End(A) to be the projection onto Bj . Clearly the sequence {ai }i\u2208N satisfies (3.1) but the\nascending chain of right ideals generated by the ai 's does not stabilize.\n\u0003\n\n\f6\n\nALBERTO CANONACO, DMITRI ORLOV, AND PAOLO STELLARI\n\nAs a matter of notation, recall that if T is a triangulated category with arbitrary direct sums\nand S is a set of objects of T, the localizing subcategory generated by S is the smallest strictly\nfull triangulated subcategory of T containing S and closed under arbitrary direct sums.\nAn object A in a triangulated category T admitting arbitrary direct sums is called compact\nif for each family of objects {Xi }i\u2208I \u2282 T the canonical map\nM\n\nHom(A, Xi ) \u2212\u2192 Hom (A, \u2295i Xi )\n\ni\n\nis an isomorphism. The triangulated category T is compactly generated if there is a a set S of\ncompact objects such that E \u2208 T vanishes if Hom(A, E[i]) = 0 for all A \u2208 S and all i \u2208 Z.\nFor more details, the reader can consult [12, Sect. 3.1].\nProof of Theorem 1.1. Denote by hSi \u2286 T1 the localizing subcategory generated by the set\nS. This category admits arbitrary direct sums and is compactly generated too. Moreover, it is\nknown that the subcategory of its compact objects hSic coincides with S (see [7, Lemma 2.2]).\nHence, replacing T1 with hSi we can assume that T1 is compactly generated by the set S\nand S = Tc1 .\nDenote by hker Fi \u2286 T1 the localizing subcategory that is generated by the set of compact\nobjects from ker F. By [7, Thm. 2.1], the canonical functor Tc1 / ker F \u2192 T1 /hker Fi is fully\nfaithful and its essential image is the subcategory (T1 /hker Fi)c . As T1 is compactly generated\nthe projection \u03c0 : T1 \u2192 T1 /hker Fi has a fully faithful right adjoint \u03bc : T1 /hker Fi \u2192 T1 (see\nTheorem 8.4.4 and Lemma 9.1.7 in [8]).\nIn view of Proposition 2.3, the result is proved if \u03bc \u25e6\u03c0(A) is compact, for any compact A \u2208 Tc1 .\nSince Tc1 is the smallest thick subcategory containing S it is enough to prove that \u03bc\u25e6\u03c0(A) \u2208 Tc1 ,\nfor any A \u2208 S. By Lemma 3.3, we can assume that A is indecomposable.\nConsider the adjunction morphism mA : A \u2192 \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A) and complete it to a distinguished\ntriangle\n(3.2)\n\nNA [\u22121]\n\nlA\n\n/A\n\nmA\n\n/ \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A)\n\nnA\n\n/ NA .\n\nOf course, the result is proved if we show that nA is the zero map, whence we can assume that\nNA \u2247 0.\nThe functor F is full and so, by the same argument as in the proof of Proposition 2.3, the map\nmA \u25e6(\u2212)\n\nHomT1 (B, A) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 HomT1 (B, \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A)) is surjective for any compact object B \u2208 Tc1 . This\nimplies that the map\n(3.3)\n\nnA \u25e6(\u2212)\n\nHomT1 (B, \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A)) \u2212\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 HomT1 (B, NA )\n\nis zero.\nSince T1 is compactly generated, there exists Z \u2208 Tc1 and a non-trivial morphism \u03c60 : Z \u2192\nNA [\u22121]. Denote by CZ the cone in Tc1 of the morphism lA \u25e6 \u03c60 : Z \u2192 A and consider the\n\n\fDOES FULL IMPLY FAITHFUL?\n\n7\n\nfollowing commutative diagram whose rows are distinguished triangles\nCZ [\u22121]\n\nlA \u25e6\u03c60\n\n/Z\n\u03c60\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A)[\u22121]\n\n\u2212nA [\u22121]\n\n\u000f\n/ NA [\u22121]\n\n/ CZ\n\n/A\nid\n\nlA\n\n\u000f\n/A\n\nmA\n\n\u000f\n/ \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A).\n\nAs CZ is a compact object, the composition map CZ [\u22121] \u2192 \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A)[\u22121] \u2192 NA [\u22121] is\nthe zero morphism (use that the morphism in (3.3) is trivial). Hence there is a non-trivial map\n\u03c61 : A \u2192 NA [\u22121] such that \u03c61 \u25e6lA \u25e6\u03c60 = \u03c60 . Now consider A and \u03c61 instead of the pair Z and\n\u03c60 . Repeating the same argument as above we obtain another map \u03c62 : A \u2192 NA [\u22121] such that\n\u03c62 \u25e6 lA \u25e6 \u03c61 = \u03c61 . In conclusion, this procedure yields a sequence of morphisms \u03c6i : A \u2192 NA [\u22121]\nsuch that \u03c6i+1 \u25e6 lA \u25e6 \u03c6i = \u03c6i , for i > 0.\nSet ai := lA \u25e6 \u03c6i , for any i > 0. This defines a sequence satisfying (3.1) in End(A). But by\nassumption this ring is idempotent noetherian. Hence there exists n \u2208 N such that ai \u25e6End(A) =\nan \u25e6End(A), for all i \u2265 n. Given N > n, by Remark 3.2 aN is idempotent. Since aN = lA \u25e6\u03c6N\nis not zero and A is indecomposable, aN must be the identity and so A is a direct summand\nof NA [\u22121]. This implies mA = 0. Since mA corresponds to id\u03c0(A) by adjunction, this means\n\u03c0(A) \u223c\n\u0003\n= 0 and so \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c0(A) \u223c\n= 0 as well. This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.1.\nRemark 3.4. It is important to note that the theorem above can be applied to a large class\nof triangulated categories. Assume that our triangulated category S is algebraic, i.e. it can be\nrealized as a homotopy category of some differential graded category. If S is idempotent complete\nand equals to the closure of a set of objects S under shifts, extensions and passage to direct\nfactors (i.e. classically generated by this set), then by part b) of [6, Thm. 3.8] the category S\nis equivalent to a category of compact objects in the derived category of a dg-category, which\nis compactly generated and admits arbitrary direct sums. Thus it follows that if the rings of\nendomorphisms of all objects from S are idempotent noetherian, then the statement of Theorem\n1.1 holds for such S.\n3.2. Derived categories of abelian categories. Recall that an object E in an abelian category\nis called noetherian if any ascending chain G1 \u2286 G2 \u2286 . . . \u2286 Gn \u2286 . . . \u2286 E of subobjects of E\nstabilizes, i.e. there is n \u2208 N such that Gn = Gi for all i \u2265 n. An abelian category is called\nnoetherian if it is equivalent to a small category and every object is noetherian. An abelian category\nis called locally noetherian if it satisfies axiom (AB5) and has a set of noetherian generators (see,\nfor example, [11]).\nRemark 3.5. It can be proved that the full subcategory of noetherian objects in any locally\nnoetherian abelian category is itself a noetherian abelian category.\nThe following statement says that the endomorphism algebra of a 'noetherian' object is idempotent noetherian.\nProposition 3.6. Let A be an abelian category with countable direct sums. Let C \u2208 Db (A) be\nan object such that the cohomology H k (C) \u2208 A is noetherian for every k \u2208 Z. Then the algebra\nEndDb (A) (C) is idempotent noetherian.\n\n\f8\n\nALBERTO CANONACO, DMITRI ORLOV, AND PAOLO STELLARI\n\nProof. Let {ai }i\u2208N be a sequence in End(C) satisfying (3.1). We set M := \u2295i\u2208N C and\nb\nN := \u2212\nhocolim\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192{ai }, so that there is a distinguished triangle in D (A)\n(3.4)\n\nM\n\nf\n\n/M\n\na\u2032\n\n/N\n\nwhere, denoting by \u03b9i : C \u2192 M (for i \u2208 N ) the inclusion of the ith component, the morphism\nf is defined by f \u25e6 \u03b9i := \u03b9i \u2212 \u03b9i+1 \u25e6 ai . By (3.1) the morphism a : M \u2192 C defined by a \u25e6 \u03b9i := ai\nclearly satisfies a \u25e6 f = 0, hence there exists a morphism b : N \u2192 C such that b \u25e6 a\u2032 = a. Then,\nsetting also a\u2032i := a\u2032 \u25e6 \u03b9i : C \u2192 N, we have\nb \u25e6 a\u2032i = ai\n\n(3.5)\n\nfor all i \u2208 N .\n\nObserve that, if i \u2208 N is such that a\u2032i \u25e6 b : N \u2192 N is an isomorphism, then ai \u25e6 End(C) =\nb \u25e6 Hom(C, N ). Indeed, by (3.5) we have ai \u25e6 c = b \u25e6 a\u2032i \u25e6 c for every c \u2208 End(C). Conversely,\n(3.5) implies that\nb \u25e6 d = b \u25e6 (a\u2032i \u25e6 b) \u25e6 (a\u2032i \u25e6 b)\u22121 \u25e6 d = ai \u25e6 b \u25e6 (a\u2032i \u25e6 b)\u22121 \u25e6 d\nfor every d \u2208 Hom(C, N ).\nThus, in order to conclude that End(C) is idempotent noetherian, it is enough to prove that\nfor i \u226b 0 the morphism a\u2032i \u25e6 b is an isomorphism in Db (A), which is the case if and only\nif H k (a\u2032i \u25e6 b) is an isomorphism in A for every k \u2208 Z. Since C has only a finite number of\nnon-zero cohomologies, we can fix k, and for simplicity of notation we will denote with an overline\nthe functor H k . Now, it is easy to see that the sequence\n/M\n\n0\n\nf\n\n/M\n\na\n\n/C\n\nis exact in A. On the other hand, the distinguished triangle (3.4) also yields an exact sequence\n0\n\n/M\n\nf\n\n/M\n\na\u2032\n\n/N\n\n/ 0.\n\nAs b \u25e6 a\u2032 = a, this implies that b : N \u2192 I := im a \u2286 C is an isomorphism. Denoting moreover\nim ai \u2286 C by Ii , (3.1) clearly implies that Ii \u2286 Ij for i < j. As C is noetherian, there\nexists n \u2208 N such that Ii = In for i \u2265 n, and obviously In = I. Then we claim that a\u2032i \u25e6 b\nis an isomorphism for i > n. Indeed, this is equivalent to saying that b \u25e6 a\u2032i \u25e6 b : N \u2192 I is an\nisomorphism. Since b \u25e6 a\u2032i = ai by (3.5), this is true if and only if ai |I : I \u2192 I is an isomorphism,\nwhich follows easily from the fact that ai \u25e6 ai\u22121 = ai\u22121 and Ii = Ii\u22121 = I.\n\u0003\nAs a consequence we get the following.\nCorollary 3.7. Let A be an abelian category with arbitrary direct sums and let S \u2286 Db (A) be\na thick full triangulated subcategory whose objects have noetherian cohomology. Let F : S \u2212\u2192 T\nbe a full exact functor to a triangulated category T. Then there is an orthogonal decomposition\nS = (ker F)\u22a5 \u2295 ker F\nand F|(ker F)\u22a5 is faithful.\n\n\fDOES FULL IMPLY FAITHFUL?\n\n9\n\nProof. As in Remark 3.4, by part b) of [6, Thm. 3.8], the category S (which is idempotent\ncomplete being a thick subcategory of an idempotent complete category) is equivalent to a category\nof compact objects in the derived category of a dg-category. Thus Theorem 1.1 and Proposition\n3.6 give the desired conclusion.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.8. If A is a locally noetherian abelian category and S is the full subcategory of\nDb (A) consisting of all objects with noetherian cohomology, then, in view of Remark 3.5, S is\nautomatically a thick triangulated subcategory and Corollary 3.7 applies.\n4. The geometric case\nLet X be a noetherian scheme. We denote by D(X) the full subcategory of the derived\ncategory of sheaves of OX -modules consisting of (unbounded) complexes with quasi-coherent\ncohomology. Let Db (X) be the full subcategory of D(X) consisting of bounded complexes with\ncoherent cohomology. As X is noetherian, Db (X) is equivalent to Db (coh(X)), where coh(X)\nis the abelian category of coherent sheaves on X (see [1, Cor. 2.2.2.2]). Moreover, Perf (X) will\nbe the full subcategory of D(X) consisting of perfect complexes. Notice that Perf (X) \u2286 Db (X).\nNow assume that Z is a closed subscheme of X. We denote by DZ (X) the full subcategory of\nD(X) consisting of complexes with cohomology supported on Z. We will also need the following\nfull subcategories of DZ (X) :\nDbZ (X) := DZ (X) \u2229 Db (X),\nPerf Z (X) := DZ (X) \u2229 Perf (X).\nProposition 4.1. ([12], Theorem 6.8.) The category DZ (X) is compactly generated and the\ncategory of compact objects DZ (X)c coincides with Perf Z (X).\nRemark 4.2. The category Qcoh(X) of quasi-coherent sheaves of OX -modules over a noetherian scheme X is a locally noetherian abelian category and the full subcategory of noetherian\nobjects in Qcoh(X) is precisely coh(X). The same is true in the supported case as well.\nThe following result is then a straightforward consequence of Proposition 3.6.\nProposition 4.3. If X is a noetherian scheme containing a closed subscheme Z and E \u2208\nDbZ (X), then the endomorphism ring EndDb (X) (E) is idempotent noetherian.\nZ\n\nCorollary 3.7 (applied to the case A = QcohZ (X) ) and Remark 4.2 immediately give the\nfollowing.\nCorollary 4.4. Let X be a noetherian scheme containing a closed subscheme Z. If S is either\nPerf Z (X) or DbZ (X) and F : S \u2192 T is a full exact functor to a triangulated category T, then\nthere is an orthogonal decomposition S = (ker F)\u22a5 \u2295 ker F and F|(ker F)\u22a5 is faithful.\nConsider now the following rather general result.\nLemma 4.5. Let T be a compactly generated triangulated category with arbitrary direct sums\nsuch that Tc has an orthogonal decomposition Tc = S1 \u2295 S2 . Then T has an orthogonal\ndecomposition T = S\u03031 \u2295 S\u03032 , where S\u0303i , for i = 1, 2, is the localizing subcategory generated by\nSi .\n\n\f10\n\nALBERTO CANONACO, DMITRI ORLOV, AND PAOLO STELLARI\n\nProof. We first show that S\u03031 and S\u03032 are orthogonal. Indeed, if A \u2208 S1 , then A\u22a5 := {B \u2208\nT : Hom(A, B) = 0} \u2287 S\u03032 because A\u22a5 is localizing, A being compact. On the other hand, if\nB \u2208 S\u03032 , then \u22a5 B := {A \u2208 T : Hom(A, B) = 0} \u2287 S1 by what we have just proved. Since \u22a5 B\nis a localizing subcategory of T, this implies that \u22a5 B \u2287 S\u03031 . Hence Hom(S\u03031 , S\u03032 ) = 0 and a\nsimilar argument yields Hom(S\u03032 , S\u03031 ) = 0.\nFor i = 1, 2, the canonical full embedding ji : S\u0303i \u2192 T has a right adjoint si : T \u2192 S\u0303i\n(see, for example, Theorem 8.3.3 and Proposition 8.4.2 in [8]). This provides a canonical map\nj1 \u25e6 s1 (X) \u2295 j2 \u25e6 s2 (X) \u2192 X, for any X \u2208 T, which sits in a distinguished triangle\nCX [\u22121]\n\n/ j1 \u25e6 s1 (X) \u2295 j2 \u25e6 s2 (X)\n\n/ CX .\n\n/X\n\nFor any compact object S \u2208 S1 , applying the functor Hom(j1 (S), \u2212) to this triangle, we obtain\nisomorphisms\n\u223c\n\n\u223c\n\nHom(j1 (S), j1 \u25e6 s1 (X) \u2295 j2 \u25e6 s2 (X)) \u2212\n\u2192 Hom(S, s1 (X)) \u2212\n\u2192 Hom(j1 (S), X).\nThis implies that Hom(ji (S), CX ) = 0 for any compact object S \u2208 Si and i = 1, 2. Since T\nis compactly generated and, by assumption, any compact object of T is a direct sum of objects\nfrom S1 and S2 , we deduce that CX = 0. Hence the map j1 \u25e6 s1 (X) \u2295 j2 \u25e6 s2 (X) \u2192 X is an\nisomorphism.\n\u0003\nWe can now apply the previous result to a concrete geometric question.\nCorollary 4.6. Let Z be a connected closed subscheme of a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme\nX. Then the triangulated categories Perf Z (X), DbZ (X), and DZ (X) are indecomposable.\nProof. By Lemma 4.5 and Proposition 4.1, a non-trivial orthogonal decomposition of Perf Z (X)\ninduces a non-trivial orthogonal decomposition of DZ (X). So it is enough to show that the latter\ncategory and DbZ (X) are indecomposable. As the proof for these two categories is the same, we\nwill deal only with DZ (X).\nHence assume that there exists an orthogonal decomposition DZ (X) = S1 \u2295 S2 . Following the\nstrategy in [4, Example 3.2], consider the structure sheaf OZ of the subscheme Z \u2286 X. Since\nZ is connected, the object OZ is indecomposable in DZ (X) and thus it belongs to one of the\ncategories Si , for i = 1, 2. Without loss of generality, let it belong to S1 .\nFor any closed point z \u2208 Z, there is a non-trivial morphism OZ \u2192 Oz . Thus Oz \u2208 S1 , for\nall closed point z \u2208 Z. Finally, consider a perfect complex A \u2208 Perf Z (X). Take an affine open\nsubset U \u223c\n= Spec(A) \u2286 X such that the restriction of A to U is a non-trivial object. By\ndefinition, A|U is isomorphic in D(U ) to an object P corresponding to a bounded complex of\nfinitely generated projective A -modules P. Set i such that H i (P ) is the greatest non-trivial\ncohomology of P. Then H i (P ) is a finitely generated A -module and, by Nakayama's lemma,\nthere is a non-trivial map H i (P) \u2192 Oz , for a closed point z \u2208 Z. This induces a non-trivial\nmap P \u2192 Oz and therefore all perfect complexes belong to S1 . This implies that S1 coincides\nwith DZ (X).\n\u0003\nThis result, combined with Corollary 4.4, gives Theorem 1.2.\n\n\fDOES FULL IMPLY FAITHFUL?\n\n11\n\n5. A counterexample\nIn this section we provide an example of a full exact and non-trivial functor F : T1 \u2192 T2\nbetween triangulated categories such that T1 is indecomposable and F is not faithful.\nTo this end, let A be a commutative algebra over a field k with generators x1 , x2 , . . . and\nwith relations xj xi = xi for i < j. Let Mod-A be the category of right A -modules and set\nD(A) := D(Mod-A). Denote by Perf (A) the full subcategory of D(A) of perfect complexes,\ni.e. the smallest thick subcategory of D(A) containing A.\nLemma 5.1. The triangulated category Perf (A) is indecomposable.\nProof. Obviously Perf (A) \u223c\n= Perf (Spec(A)). By Corollary 4.6, the result follows once we know\nthat Spec(A) is connected. This, in turn, is equivalent to showing that A does not contain\nnon-trivial idempotents. But this is an easy exercise using the definition of the algebra A.\n\u0003\n\u223c\nDenote by I the ideal generated by all xi , so that A/I = k. Consider the functor\nL\n\nG : D(A) \u2212\u2192 D(k),\n\nX 7\u2212\u2192 X \u2297A k\n\nand set F := G|Perf (A) : Perf (A) \u2192 D(k).\nLemma 5.2. The functor F is full.\nProof. It is easy to see that the result follows if we prove that the morphisms\nL\n\n(5.1)\n\nHomA (A, P ) \u2212\u2192 Homk (F(A), F(P )) = Homk (k, P \u2297A k)\nL\n\nHomA (P, A) \u2212\u2192 Homk (F(P ), F(A)) = Homk (P \u2297A k, k)\nare surjective, for any P \u2208 Perf (A). Any perfect complex P is a direct summand in Perf (A)\nof a bounded complex of finitely generated free A -modules. Hence, it is sufficient to consider the\ncase when P itself is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex\ndt\n\nd\u22121\n\nd0\n\nd1\n\nds\u22121\n\nQ\u2022 = {Qt \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 Q\u22121 \u2212\u2192 Q0 \u2212\u2192 Q1 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 Qs }\nof finitely generated free A -modules.\nTake a morphism f1 : k \u2192 Q0 \u2297A k such that the composition (d0 \u2297k)\u25e6f1 is trivial. Composing\nwith A \u2192 k, the morphism f1 induces a map g1 : A \u2192 Q0 \u2297A k which, in turn, lifts to\nh1 : A \u2192 Q0 . Now the element (d0 \u25e6h1 )(1) \u2208 Q1 \u223c\n= Am is in I m and xn (d0 \u25e6h1 )(1) = (d0 \u25e6h1 )(1),\nfor a sufficiently large n. So setting h\u20321 := (1 \u2212 xn ) \u25e6 h1 , we get d0 \u25e6 h\u20321 (1) = 0 and F(h\u20321 ) = f1 .\nIn particular, the first morphism in (5.1) is surjective.\nSimilarly, to deal with the second morphism in (5.1), let f2 : Q0 \u2297A k \u2192 k be a morphism\nsuch that the composition f2 \u25e6 (d\u22121 \u2297 k) is trivial. Again, composing with the natural morphism\nQ0 = Q0 \u2297A A \u2192 Q0 \u2297A k, we get a morphism g2 : Q0 \u2192 k which lifts to a morphism h2 : Q0 \u2192 A.\nFor very large n, define h\u20322 := (1 \u2212 xn ) \u25e6 h2 so that, again, h\u20322 \u25e6 d\u22121 (aj ) = 0, for all aj in the\n\u0003\nset of generators a1 , . . . ar of Q\u22121 . Then F(h\u20322 ) = f2 and this concludes the proof.\nTo prove that F is not faithful, consider the non-trivial morphism xi : A \u2192 A, for i any\npositive integer. On the other hand, the morphism F(xi ) : k \u2192 k is the trivial morphism.\nAcknowledgements. D.O. thanks Simons Center for Geometry and Physics for hospitality and stimulating\natmosphere.
