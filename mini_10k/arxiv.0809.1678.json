The 19th century\neruption of Eta Carinae, the prototype of these events [3], ejected about 12 solar\nmasses at speeds of 650 km/s, with a kinetic energy of almost 1050ergs[4]. Some\nfaster material with speeds up to 1000-2000 km/s had previously been reported\n[5,6,7,8] but its full distribution was unknown. Here I report observations of much\nfaster material with speeds up to 3500-6000 km/s, reaching farther from the star\nthan the fastest material in earlier reports [5]. This fast material roughly doubles\nthe kinetic energy of the 19th century event, and suggests that it released a blast\nwave now propagating ahead of the massive ejecta. Thus, Eta Carinae's outer\nshell now mimics a low-energy supernova remnant. The eruption has usually been\ndiscussed in terms of an extreme wind driven by the star's luminosity [2,3,9,10],\nbut fast material reported here suggests that it was powered by a deep-seated\nexplosion rivalling a supernova, perhaps triggered by the pulsational pair\ninstability[11]. This may alter interpretations of similar events seen in other\ngalaxies.\nEta Carinae [3] is the most luminous and the best studied among LBVs [1,2]. It is the\nmost massive and luminous star in our region of the Milky Way, and it provides\nimportant constraints on the pre-supernova (SN) evolution of the most massive stars,\neven if it is a rather extreme example of the instabilities that they encounter. Eta\nCarinae probably began its life with an initial mass of around 150 M\uf0a4, and has a current\nestimated mass of about 90-100 M\uf0a4, with much of the difference lost in sudden giant\neruptions in the past few thousand years [1]. It is orbited by a companion star [12], but\nit is unclear whether the companion played a role in its eruptive instability [4].\nIt is now well established that the so-called \"Homunculus\" nebula was ejected\nduring the 1840's near the peak of Eta Carinae's eruption [13]. That event ejected at\nleast 12 M\uf0a4 of gas moving at speeds up to 650 km/s [4,14]. This speed roughly matches\nthe present-day polar wind speed [15] and is close to the expected escape velocity from\nthe star's surface. The observed ejecta speeds reported here are much faster than this,\nand are quite surprising since such high speeds are not expected in a wind from an\nevolved massive star like Eta Carinae.\nThe data reported here come in two varieties. First, near-infrared spectra of the\nHe I \u03bb10830 emission line obtained with the GNIRS instrument on the Gemini South\ntelescope (Fig. 1) reveal emission from what appears to be a fast out-flowing disk or\nmaterial near the waist of bipolar lobes outside the Homunculus, with a spatial scale and\nexpansion speeds roughly twice those of the well-known equatorial skirt of the\n\n\f2\n\nHomunculus. Although extended He I \u03bb10830 emission had been discovered at one\nposition outside the Homunculus in a previous study [6], the larger structure and faster\nvelocities reported here have not been seen before in any data. This material is flowing\naway from the star with radial speeds of roughly 1000-2000 km/s, and appears to be\npresent all the way around the Homunculus not far from the equatorial plane.\nSecond, visual-wavelength spectra of the region near H\u03b1 show [N II] \u03bb6548 and\n\u03bb6583 emission from extremely fast material with Doppler shifts of roughly -3000 to\n+2500 km/s (see Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Information). Emission from\nthis fast material was suspected to exist in previous data of lower quality obtained at one\nposition around Eta Carinae [5], and provided the main motivation to obtain the highquality data seen here. The fast N-rich gas reported here is spatially coincident with or\ninside the soft X-ray shell around Eta Carinae (Fig. S1). It is apparently running into\nthe many N-rich outer knots seen in visual-wavelength images [5,16,17,18], because it\nis near or interior to these knots, but is expanding outward at a much faster pace. The\nfastest material has not been seen in most [N II] images of Eta Carinae, like those\nobtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (Fig. 1), because it is Doppler shifted far out\nof the narrow filter bandpass. It follows the same bipolar expansion pattern seen for the\nHomunculus [14], as well as that of the slower [N II]-bright knots in the outer ejecta\n[19] (blueshifted to the south-east, redshifted to the northwest). The observed Doppler\nshifts of up to 3000 km/s are a lower limit to the deprojected maximum velocity of this\nmaterial. Since this material is seen far off to the side of Eta Carinae, its trajectory must\nbe inclined away from our line of sight, with plausible values for the true space velocity\nranging from 3500-6000 km/s (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Information). The\nhigher speeds would require that this material has been accelerated by the pressure\nbehind the blast wave since its ejection.\nThe fastest material has [N II]/H\u03b1 ratios similar to the slower N-rich knots [18],\nindicating that it was launched at these speeds by the same evolved primary star that\nejected the N-rich Homunculus [21] and all its other N-rich material. While it is\nintriguing that speeds around 3,000 km/s are similar to the wind speeds of the secondary\nstar in models for the X-ray emission from Eta Carinae [22], the notion that perhaps the\nsecondary star was responsible for ejecting this fast N-rich material has little merit upon\ncloser examination. If one ascribes the 1843 outburst to the as yet unseen secondary\nstar in the Eta Carinae binary system, several inconsistencies arise: First, the expansion\nspeed, bipolar shape, and polar axis orientation of the Homunculus [14] (known to be\nejected in the 1843 event [13]) match the present-day properties of the primary star's\nwind [15]. Second, the star we observe now as the primary is wildly variable, has an\nenormous mass-loss rate, and shows visible signs of recovery from the 1843 eruption,\nwhile the putative secondary star has not been detected. Third, for an evolved massive\nstar to produce the wind speeds required of the secondary star, it must be a compact Hpoor Wolf-Rayet star, but this is incompatible with Eta Car's multiple ejections of\nmassive H-rich nebulosity. In short, passing the burden of mass ejection to Eta Car's\ncompanion star is not viable.\nIn any case, speeds of this order evoke properties more like SN explosions than\nsuper-Eddington winds [9], and they provide a fundamental new clue to the nature of\n\n\f3\n\nthe trigger behind Eta Car's eruption. Combining the fast near-equatorial material\ntraced by He I \u03bb10830 with fast polar ejecta traced by [N II] implies a bipolar forward\nshock geometry, perhaps like that depicted in Figure 3. The geometry is similar to that\nof the Homunculus itself [7,14], but 3-4 times its size and speed. This fast blast wave\nfrom the 19th century eruption of Eta Carinae is powered by the very fast and low\ndensity N-rich material that is coincident with or interior to the X-ray shell [23].\nSeward et al. [23] found that the properties of the soft X-ray shell were consistent with a\nblast-wave interpretation. It is the interaction between the blast wave from the 1843\nevent overtaking the 500-1000 yr old [17] clumpy N-rich ejecta shell \u2013 and not the\nolder condensations running into ambient material \u2013 which apparently gives rise to the\nX-ray emission and shock ionization of the outer ejecta. This fast blast wave is likely to\nbe important for the total energy budget of the 1843 eruption. If the high speed material\ncontains only 5% of the mass of the Homunculus, for example (corresponding to a\nlikely average density of at least 500 cm-3 filling the volume of a sphere over the range\nof radii from the star where the fast material is seen with a ~0.5 filling factor), but is\nmoving at speeds 5 times faster, it may contain 7\u00d71049 ergs. This amount of kinetic\nenergy would be comparable to or could even exceed the kinetic energy of the main\nHomunculus nebula [4].\nWhat could be the origin of this extremely fast and energetic forward shock?\nCurrently favoured models for the mass loss during a giant LBV eruption involve a\nradiation-driven wind as the star exceeds the Eddington luminosity limit [2,3,9,10], but\nin that case one expects a wind to be quite slow [9]. Fast material may escape through\nregions between dense clumps if the wind becomes highly porous [9], but this still\ndoesn't explain how material is accelerated to speeds far exceeding the star's escape\nspeed. Instead, an event of this sort, which also launched the 12 M\uf0a4 of matter in the\nHomunculus [4], may have been a deep-seated explosion. Its constraints are reminiscent\nof the pulsational pair instability [11] or some other instability associated with explosive\nnuclear burning in the latest stages of evolution. However, those burning events are\nexpected to occur shortly (~10 yr) before the final core collapse SN explosion, as\nhypothesized for the progenitor of the extremely luminous SN 2006gy [24,25], or in\nsome cases as much as 1,000 yr before core collapse. In the unique case of SN 2006jc,\na precursor LBV-like outburst was actually observed just 2 yr prior to the final\nsupernova [26,27]. Eta Car has not yet reached core collapse even though the eruption\nhappened more than 160 yr ago, and it is thought to have undergone similar eruptive\nevents ~1000 yr ago [17].\nAltogether, the presence of a fast blast wave has critical implications for\nunderstanding the nature of Eta Carinae's 1843 eruption, and the LBV instability in\ngeneral. In effect, it requires that these outbursts can have an explosive aspect that has\nnot previously been appreciated, blurring the observational and phenomenological\ndistinctions between giant LBV eruptions and SN explosions in the most massive stars.\nA corollary is that the extended nebula now seen around Eta Carinae is analogous to a\nlow-energy supernova remnant, and the X-ray emission arising from the interaction\nbetween the blast wave and surrounding material may have been stronger in the past.\nEta Carinae is also the prototype for a class of stellar eruptions seen in other galaxies,\nsometimes called \"SN impostors\", Type V supernovae, or faint Type IIn supernovae\n[28]. Indeed, there may even be an ill-defined continuum in energy between eruptions\n\n\f4\n\nlike Eta Carinae, super-outbursts of LBVs like SN 1961V [29], and faint core-collapse\nSNe. Since these LBV outbursts can evidently have powerful blast waves of a few\nthousand km/s, the observations reported here indicate that detections of radio\nsynchrotron or X-ray emission are not reliable ways to distinguish between LBV\neruptions and genuine core-collapse SN explosions.\nReceived and accepted dates.\n\n1.

The 25x0.3\narcsec spectroscopic slit aperture of the GNIRS spectrograph was oriented at P.A.=+40 deg (SW\nto NE) crossing the NW polar lobe of the Homunculus nebula (see image; top). In the resulting\nposition-velocity plot (bottom), the broad horizontal strip is from reflected continuum light\nscattered by dust in the Homunculus NW polar lobe, while He I \u03bb10830 emission from fast\nmaterial is seen outside of that structure over a large range of velocities. The top image is a\ncomposite-colour visual wavelength image made from several different exposures obtained\nusing the WFPC2 camera on the Hubble Space Telescope, through the F336W (blue), F631N\n(green), and F658N (red) filters, and is shown here only for a comparison of the ejecta\nmorphology with the slit placement. These data were reduced in a manner consistent with\nprevious similar data [6,14]. The outer gas that emits He I in the bottom panel spectrum appears\n\n\f7\n\nred/orange in this image because of strong [N II] emission. The position-velocity plot (lower\npanel) is a sub-section of a 1.0-1.15 \u03bcm spectrum centred on the bright He I \u03bb10830 emission\nline, obtained on 2005 March 20 using the GNIRS spectrograph mounted on the Gemini South\ntelescope. It is a combination of four individual exposures of 90 s each. The image (top) and\nlong-slit spectrum (bottom) have the same spatial scale. The dashed white ellipse in the bottom\npanel marks a He I feature that arises from emission formed in the central star's wind, but is\nscattered and red-shifted by dust grains; it is unrelated to the current topic.\n\nFigure 2. Extremely fast nitrogen-rich material surrounding Eta Carinae. This panel\nshows a 2-D position/velocity spectrum at an example offset position 20-arcsec east of the star,\nresulting from a 15-min exposure obtained on 2006 March 15 using the RC- Spec spectrograph\nmounted on the CTIO 4-m telescope. Similar visual-wavelength spectra at several additional\noffset positions are included in the Supplementary Information (Fig. S1). The velocity scale is\nset for the [N II] \u03bb6548 line to aid the interpretation, because blue-shifted emission dominates at\nthis position. [N II] \u03bb6548 emission reveals material travelling at blue-shifted Doppler speeds\nup to 3000 km/s, coincident with the outer shell seen in X-rays, while the dense N-rich knots\nseen in HST images have much slower speeds of 100-300 km/s. The slow-moving knots have\nbeen studied in detail [5,16,17,18,19], but the faster material at -2000 to -3000 km/s had only\nbeen suspected at one location in a single exposure in previous data of lower quality [5]. These\nearlier observations provided the motivation for the higher-quality spectra presented here.\n\n\f8\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the possible geometry of Eta Carinae's blast wave. This simplified\ndiagram depicts the basic geometry of Eta Carinae's outer ejecta, with an Earth-based observer\nlocated to the left. The inner shaded structure shows the shape and orientation of the\nHomunculus nebula [7,14]. Some of the relatively slow, dense N-rich knots from a previous\neruptive event ~1000 yr ago [17] are now being overrun by the fast forward shock from the\n1843 eruption of Eta Car. This collision gives rise to the soft X-ray shell [23], and UV radiation\nfrom shocked gas ionizes pre-shock material in the slower N-rich knots seen in images. For\nbackground information on previous studies of these slower outer debris, see refs\n[5,16,17,18,19,20]. Part of the thin side wall of the approaching side of this bipolar shock\nstructure crosses in front of our line- of-sight to the Homunculus nebula, which is a reflection\nnebula. This part of the structure, blue-shifted at roughly -1000 km/s, may have been seen\npreviously in absorption in the Ca II HK [7] and He I \u03bb10830 [6] lines, and in emission in H\u03b1\nand [N II] lines [7,8], but the connection between these velocity features and the polar blast\nwave shown here is not entirely clear with available data. A typical narrow-band imaging\nfilter, like the F658N filter of the WFPC2 camera on HST, will exclude the fastest Dopplershifted features.\n\n\f9\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nSupplementary Figure S1. The top right panel shows a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image\nobtained with the WFPC2 camera's WF3 chip using the F658N filter, tracing [N II] \u03bb6583\nemission [see ref. 13]. Superposed are contours of soft X-ray emission obtained with the\nChandra X-ray Observatory [23], as well as slit positions of visual-wavelength spectra at\nvarious offsets. The image and contours are taken from [5], and are reproduced here for\ncomparison with the spectral features. The remaining panels are the same as in Figure 2, but for\nall 6 offset slit aperture positions to the east (left) and west (right) of the star noted in the image\n(these data were obtained on the same night and with the same instrument and telescope setup as\n\n\f10\n\nthe spectra in Fig. 2). Position-velocity plots on the left column are made to show the Doppler\nshift relative to the shorter-wavelength [N II] \u03bb6548 line, to emphasize the fastest blue-shifted\nmaterial. Likewise, the two panels in the right column are plotted for the longer-wavelength\nemission line in the doublet, [N II] \u03bb6583, in order to emphasize the fastest red-shifted material.\nThe fastest blue-shifted features appear to outline the thin outer part of a polar cavity, perhaps\nthe approaching side of a bipolar blast wave as depicted in Figure 3, especially in the offset\npositions 14\" and 18\" east, which slice through the interior parts of the cavity.\n\nSupplementary Figure S2. Trajectories (blue) of the dense and relatively slow \"E\nCondensations\" [16], the group of dense knots located 20-24 arcsec east of the star in the image\nin Figure S1. Line-of-sight radial velocities measured in our spectra are combined with proper\nmotion measurements [17] to derive true space velocities (values noted in blue in km/s) and\ntrajectory angles from the plane of the sky ranging from 15 deg (E5) to 42 deg (E4). The plane\nof the sky is horizontal in this figure, and the observer is at the bottom. If the fast material with\nDoppler shifts of -3000 km/s is directed at an angle of 30 deg from the plane of the sky, shown\nhere, similar to E1, 2, and 3, then its true space velocity is roughly 6,000 km/s. If on the other\nhand it is directed closer to our line of sight and tilted about 60 deg from the plane of the sky,\nappropriate for linear motion and an age of 160 yr (placing it near the polar axis of the\nHomunculus), then its true space velocity is about 3500 km/s.\n\n\f"}
