As such, noncommutative quantum field theory (NCQFT) has the potential to provide an attractive and\nmotivated theory of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). However, while a consistent\nnoncommutative (NC) version of QED has been developed, a NC analog of the full SM has\nproven to be problematic for reasons detailed below. Possible NC gauge groups and matter\nrepresentations are theoretically restricted, and as we will show, the basic difficulty lies in\nconstructing a viable symmetry breaking mechanism which reduces the NC gauge group to\nthat of the SM. We investigate a variety of models and demonstrate that the NC symmetry\nbreaking mechanism in a leading candidate for a NCSM[3] leads to an unavoidable violation\nof tree-level unitarity in gauge boson scattering.\nNCQFT can be realized[4] in the string theoretic limit where string endpoints propagate in the presence of background fields. In this case, the endpoints of strings no longer\ncommute and their coordinate operators obey the relation\n\n[x\u0302\u03bc , x\u0302\u03bd ] = i\u03b8\u03bc\u03bd =\n\ni\n\nc\u03bc\u03bd\n\u039b2N C\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd (c\u03bc\u03bd ) is a constant, real, anti-symmetric matrix and \u039bN C represents the scale where\nNC effects set in. The most likely value for the NC scale is that of the string or fundamental\nPlanck scale which, in principle, can be of order a TeV. Space-space noncommutativity occurs\nin the presence of background magnetic fields with \u03b8ij \u2261 (\u0109B )ij /\u039b2B 6= 0, whereas space-time\nNC theories are related to background electric fields with \u03b80i \u2261 (\u0109E )0i /\u039b2E 6= 0. Note that\nthe unit vectors \u0109B,E are frame independent and hence Lorentz invariance will be violated at\nthe \u039bB,E NC scales[5]. These theories conserve CPT and have been claimed to be unitary\n1\n\n\fif the condition \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd \u2265 0 is satisfied[6]. While this condition might hold for unbroken NC\ntheories, we will show below that it is not sufficient to guarantee unitarity for all choices of\nHiggs representations in the spontaneously broken case.\nThere are two approaches for constructing quantum field theories on NC spaces. The\nfirst relates fields in the NC and the usual R4 spaces via the Weyl-Moyal correspondence. In\nthis case, ordinary fields are replaced by their NC counterparts and the ordering of fields in\nthe NC space is given by the Moyal star product, defined by\n\u00c2(x\u0302)B\u0302(x\u0302) = A(x) \u2217 B(x)\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\u2190\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2192\n= A(x) exp{ \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bc \u2202 \u03bd }B(x) ,\n2\nwhere the hatted quantities correspond to those in the NC space. NCQFT is formulated as\nthat of ordinary QFT with star products substituting for products and commutators replaced\nby Moyal brackets,\n[A, B]M B = A \u2217 B \u2212 B \u2217 A ,\nwith\n\nR\n\n(3)\n\nd4 x[A(x), B(x)]M B = 0. Only U(n) Lie algebras are closed under Moyal brackets[7]\n\nand hence NC model building is restricted in this case. The simplest version of a NCSM\nthus requires a gauge group at least as large as U(3) \u00d7 U(2) \u00d7 U(1).\nThe second approach relies on the Seiberg-Witten map which represents the NC fields\nin terms of the corresponding fields in ordinary R4 as a power series expansion in \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd . While\nthis procedure allows for generalizations of the star product to be constructed for a broader\nset of gauge theories[8], it generates an infinite set of higher dimensional operators. It is\nhence difficult to employ and is not necessarily attractive as a model building option. We\nneglect this possibility here.\nNC extensions have been shown to preserve renormalizability at the one- to two-loop\n2\n\n\flevel in the cases of unbroken[9] \u03c64 and Yang-Mills theories, as well as for spontaneously\nbroken[10] U(1) and U(2) at one-loop.\nOrdinary gauge transformations for U(n) gauge theories must be modified[11] to include NC generalizations. Gauge invariance requires non-abelian like gauge couplings, even\nfor U(1) theories, and dictates that matter only be placed in the singlet, (anti-)fundamental,\nor adjoint representations. In addition, some interaction vertices pick up momentum dependent phase factors. In the NC version of QED, this induces 3- and 4-point self-couplings for\nphotons and restricts QED interactions to particles of charge q = 0, \u00b1e. Despite these limitations, 2 \u2192 2 scattering processes at high energies in QED provide clean observables[12] for\nNCQED effects. In addition, several low-energy QED processes[13], e.g., Lamb shift, g \u2212 2,\ncan probe NC interactions.\nThere are clear difficulties in formulating a NCSM based on the Weyl-Moyal approach\ndue to the restrictions imposed from group theory and gauge invariance: (i) charge quantization, e.g., NCQED cannot contain fractionally charged particles, and (ii) performing the\nNC U(n) symmetry breaking without generating a mass for the gauge fields of the SU(n)\ncomponent of the U(n). A first attempt to build a NCSM by Chaichian et al.[3] is based on\nthe gauge group U(3)c \u00d7 U(2)L \u00d7 U(1) and at first appears to resolve these issues. However,\nwe find that the model proposed by these authors leads to unitarity violation at high energies\nin 2 \u2192 2 gauge boson scattering. By studying similar scattering processes in more simplified\nNC gauge theories, we have isolated the cause of the unitarity breakdown in this model to\nbe the choice of NC symmetry breaking mechanism.\nA review of the Chaichian et al. model and our calculations of gauge boson scattering\nwithin it is given in the next section. Our study of potential unitarity violation in 2 \u2192 2\ngauge scattering in a variety of simpler NC models is presented in Section III, and a discussion\n\n3\n\n\fof our results is given in Section IV.\n\n2\n\nThe Non-commutative Standard Model\n\nAs was discussed in the introduction, group theory and gauge invariance enforce strict constraints on the construction of NC models following the conventional Moyal approach. In\naddition to the requirement that theories be built out of products of U(n) factors and that\nonly the singlet (S), fundamental (F ), anti-fundamental (F\u0304 ) or adjoint (A) representations\nare allowed for matter fields (i.e., Q = 0, \u00b11 for the case of U(1)), Chaichian et al. have\nshown [14] that a \"No Go\" theorem is operative. This theorem states that for any gauge\ngroup consisting of a product of simple group factors, matter fields can only transform nontrivially under at most two of the simple groups. In particular, if a field transforms under\none factor as a F then it must transform under the second as an F\u0304 . Note that while SM\nmatter fields are already in fundamental representations, the left-handed quark doublet(QL )\ntransforms nontrivially under all three SM group factors. This clearly complicates the construction of the NCSM.\nThe minimal group structure for the NCSM which can contain SU(3)c \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7\nU(1)Y in the commutative limit is U(3)c \u00d7 U(2)L \u00d7 U(1); this has both positive and negative\nfeatures for NCSM construction. On the positive side, the SM fractional hypercharges may\nreceive contributions arising from the U(1) factor as well as from the two U(1) subgroups,\nU(1)c,L , contained in U(3)c and U(2)L so that the constraint of U(1) charge Q = 0, \u00b11\nassignments can be satisfied. However, the increase in group rank by two implies that there\nare now two new additional neutral weak bosons in the theory that will have couplings\nto SM matter fields. These two new states must be made sufficiently massive as to avoid\npresent Tevatron direct search constraints [15] as well as those arising from precision elec-\n\n4\n\n\ftroweak data [16]; we thus expect their masses to be greater than a TeV or so. In addition,\nspontaneous symmetry breaking must take place in at least two steps to recover the correct\nphenomenological structure and have the correct SM commutative limit. Effectively, this\nmeans that the U(1) \u00d7 U(1)c \u00d7 U(1)L symmetry must first break to U(1)Y without breaking\nthe SU(3)c or SU(2)L groups themselves.\n\nField\n\nU(3)\n\nU(2)\n\nU(1)\n\nQL\n\nF\u0304\n\nF\n\nS\n\nLL\n\nS\n\nF\n\nF\u0304\n\neR\n\nS\n\nS\n\nF\u0304\n\nuR\n\nF\u0304\n\nS\n\nF\n\ndR\n\nF\u0304\n\nS\n\nS\n\nh\n\nS\n\nF\n\nS\n\nTable 1: Quantum number assignments for the SM fermion and Higgs fields in the NCSM\nusing the notation discussed in the text.\n\nIn a recent paper, Chaichian [3] have apparently either overcome or satisfied all of\nthe above obstacles and constructed a NC version of the SM. The SM matter content of\nthis proposed construction is given in Table 1. As can be seen the representation content\nexplicitly satisfies the No-Go theorem. Next, the authors perform the breaking of the U(3)c \u00d7\nU(2)L \u00d7 U(1) symmetry in several steps: first, two linear combinations of the U(1)'s within\nU(1)c \u00d7 U(1)L \u00d7 U(1) must be broken. As this is a product of three group factors the\nNo-Go theorem requires that two Higgs fields are necessary to break this symmetry down\nto U(1)Y . It is clear that these Higgs fields cannot correspond to any of the usual SU(n)\nrepresentations since then their vev's would not only break the U(1) subgroups of the U(n)'s\nbut the SU(n) factors as well. To get around this, Chaichian et al. [3] have considered Higgs\n\n5\n\n\ffields in a new representation, which they call Higgsac (H) fields. They transform only under\nthe U(1) subgroup of U(n), so that when they acquire a vev the SU(n) subgroup remains\nunbroken. Essentially, a Higgsac breaks U(1)c \u00d7 U(1)L to U(1)\u2032 and a second Higgsac then\nproduces the breaking U(1)\u2032 \u00d7 U(1) to U(1)Y . Given the two distinct Higgsac vev's, the\nmasses of the two heavy gauge bosons are uncorrelated and arbitrary. To be more specific,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndenoting the original weak eigenstate U(1)c \u00d7 U(1)L \u00d7 U(1) gauge fields by G0 , W 0 and\n\u2032\n\nB, respectively, the weak and the unprimed mass eigenstate fields are related by: G0 =\n\u2032\n\nc23 G0 + s23 (c11 W 0 + s11 Y ), W 0 = \u2212s23 G0 + c23 (c11 W 0 + s11 Y ), and B = \u2212s11 W 0 + c11 Y .\nHere W 0 , G0 are the new massive gauge bosons while Y is the massless boson coupling\nto hypercharge and cij (sij ) = cos \u03b4ij (sin \u03b4ij ), with \u03b4ij being appropriate mixing angles. As\nmentioned above we anticipate that these new gauge bosons are more massive than about \u223c 1\nTeV. Given the gauge couplings g1,2,3 for the appropriate U(n) groups, the mixing angles can\nbe expressed as tan \u03b423 = 2g2 /3g3 and 2c23 tan \u03b411 = g1 /g2 . In addition, consistency with the\nfermion couplings of the SM in the commutative limit implies that g3 = gs , the usual QCD\ncoupling, g2 = g, the usual weak coupling, g1 = 2g \u2032/c11 , with g \u2032 being the usual hypercharge\ncoupling of the SM, and also the relation s11 c23 = tan \u03b8W .\nThe last step of the symmetry breaking is accomplished through the vev of the isodoublet field h listed in the Table. It generates the ordinary fermion masses in the usual manner\nas well as the conventional W \u00b1 and Z masses with the identification e = g sin \u03b8W . There\nis however one additional effect: mixing is induced between the SM Z field and the more\nmassive G0 , W 0 states which is of order m2Z /m2G,W ; for TeV or heavier states we expect this\nmixing to be quite small, \u2264 0.01, and can be safely neglected on most occasions. Given the\nvalues of the couplings, all of the mixing angles are fixed so that the only free parameters in\nthe gauge sector of the model are the masses of the G0 and W 0 states. Of course the scales\n\u039bE,B associated with the NC physics, as defined in the introduction, still remain arbitrary.\n6\n\n\fBefore examining the phenomenology of this model, we may first want to check\nwhether or not the theory is unitary at tree-level. The classic test for this in the SM is\nthe scattering of pairs of longitudinal W \u00b1 , i.e., WL+ WL\u2212 \u2192 WL+ WL\u2212 . This process provides\na particularly useful test in the NCSM case as it is independent of how the fermions are\nembedded into the theory. In the SM at amplitude level, the leading terms from a typical\ndiagram behave as (s2 /m4W ); such terms cancel among the contributions from the s- and\nt-channel \u03b3 and Z exchanges and the 4-point graph due to gauge invariance and the natural\nrelationship mW = mZ cos \u03b8W . The sub-leading s/m2W contributions also cancel when s- and\nt-channel Higgs boson exchanges are included yielding a result which does not grow with s\nand is unitary. In the NCSM, as we will see below, the leading terms still cancel because of\nthe gauge symmetry, but the subleading terms remain so that unitarity is not satisfied. Let\nus now discuss these cancellations in some detail.\nTo be as explicit and straightforward as possible, we will separately calculate both\nthe leading and next-to-leading s/m2W terms for each of the contributing diagrams to demonstrate how the required cancellations fail to occur in the NCSM. For simplicity, these calculations will be performed in the limit that the weak scale mixing induced between the Z\nand the heavy states W 0 and G0 can be neglected. The additional terms that are generated\nby such mixing are subleading to the ones included below by factors of order m2Z /m2G,W and\nwill have no influence upon our results.\nUsing the couplings derived in [9] for NC U(n) gauge theories, we can now generate all\nof the Feynman rules for this model. The relevant ones for WL+ WL\u2212 \u2192 WL+ WL\u2212 are presented\nin Fig. 1.

Although the above expression is rather\ncomplicated, it is clear that it cannot be made to vanish in the general NC case. This is most\neasily seen by the presence of the large and most dangerous terms proportional to m2G0 and\nm2W 0 ; recall that these masses are arbitrary functions of the two Higgsac vevs. Here there\nare no corresponding relationships between the new gauge boson masses themselves or with\nthose of the W \u00b1 and Z and there are no Higgsac contributions with couplings proportional\nto mG0 and/or mW 0 to help the cancellations. As we see from the above calculation, the m2G0\n11\n\n.\n\n\fand m2W 0 terms arise from the s- and t-channel vector boson exchanges when the propagators\nare expanded to leading- and next-to-leading order in s. This means that such terms are\nunavoidable in this scenario and unitarity must fail.\nIt is instructive to ask at what scale tree-level unitarity is violated in this model.\nClearly, this is dependent on the value of the center-of-mass energy, since the theory is\n\u221a\nonly unitary for all values of s when \u039bN C \u2192 \u221e. To be specific, let us examine the\nWL+ WL\u2212 scattering process in the center-of-mass frame and assume for simplicity that the\nnon-commutativity is of the space-space type. It is clear as noted above that the most\ndangerous terms are proportional to the squares of the new gauge boson masses. Keeping\nonly these leading terms we find the constraint\n\u221a\n\u039bB > 0.83[( s)6 sin2 \u03b3 (m2W 0 + 0.19m2G0 )]1/4 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere all quantities are in TeV. Here \u03b3 is the angle between the momentum p1 and the unit\nvector \u0109B . These bounds can be quite severe; taking sin \u03b3 = 1 and mW 0 = mG0 , one finds\n\u221a\n\u221a\nthat \u039bB > 0.86(9.6, 27.3) mG0 TeV for s = 1(5, 10) TeV, which is a strong constraint for\nnew gauge boson masses in the few TeV range. Similar strong bounds are to be expected in\nthe cases of space-time or mixed non-commutativity.\nIn order to elucidate the origin of the apparent problems that we have just encountered, it would be beneficial to examine a parallel set of processes in somewhat more simplified\nNC gauge theories that are more tractable. By using a set of test models we hope to cleanly\nisolate the basic causes of the unitarity failure in the NCSM and probe the issue in a more\ngeneral way. We hope to answer the question of just when are spontaneously broken NC\ngauge theories non-unitary.\n\n12\n\n\f3\n\nTest Models\n\nIn this section we examine gauge boson scattering in a variety of test cases of spontaneously\nbroken NC theories. We start with the simplest possibility, that of spontaneously broken NC\nU(1), and then work our way towards more realistic models adding one layer of complications\nat a time. In this manner, we hope to isolate the source of unitarity violation discovered\nabove and determine its consequences for future NC model building. Since the unitarity\nfailure encountered above occurred in the pure gauge/Higgs sector, we need not worry about\nthe fermion content of any of the test models that we examine below and thus need only\nconsider the process of gauge boson scattering.\n\n3.1\n\nSpontaneously Broken NC U (1)\n\nWe first examine the simplest example of a spontaneously broken NC theory, that of NC U(1)\nwhich is broken by a complex scalar field transforming as a fundamental under the gauge\ngroup. A one-loop analysis of this model was first performed in [10], to which the reader\nis referred for a more detailed discussion. The physical spectrum after symmetry breaking\nconsists of a massive real scalar Higgs field h and a massive vector field Z. This theory was\nshown by explicit calculation to be one loop renormalizable[10], and we therefore expect it\nto be unitary at tree-level unlike the NCSM whose one-loop properties are unknown. To\ntest whether or not tree-level unitarity is satisfied we calculate the high energy limit of the\nscattering process ZL ZL \u2192 ZL ZL . As in the NCSM case above, we need to check if the\npotential unitarity violating terms of O (s2 /m4Z , s/m2Z ) vanish after summing over all the\ndiagrams.\nThe Feynman rules relevant to this calculation are given in Fig. 2, and the diagrams\ncontributing to ZL ZL \u2192 ZL ZL are presented in Fig. 3. Summing these seven diagrams fol13\n\n\flowing the same procedure as in the case of the NCSM and keeping only the O (s2 /m4Z , s/m2Z )\nterms, yields the amplitude\nig 2 s\ncos(p1 \u2227 p3 \u2212 p2 \u2227 p4 ) + cos(p1 \u2227 p4 \u2212 p2 \u2227 p3 ) \u2212 2 c(12) c(34)\niM =\n2 m2Z\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n+c\u03b8 cos(p1 \u2227 p4 + p2 \u2227 p3 ) \u2212 cos(p1 \u2227 p3 + p2 \u2227 p4 ) \u2212 10 s(12) s(34)\n+s(14) s(23) \u2212 s(13) s(24)\n\n\u0013\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere c\u03b8 is defined as in the previous section. We have introduced the shorthand notation\nsin (pi \u2227 pj ) = s(ij) , cos (pi \u2227 pj ) = c(ij) ; it is important that these should not be confused\nwith the abbreviations used for the mixing angles in the NCSM. We see that the O(s2 /m4Z )\nterms cancel trivially as expected and as in the NCSM case above. Use of the relations\np1 \u2227 p2 \u2212 p3 \u2227 p4 = p1 \u2227 p3 \u2212 p2 \u2227 p4\np1 \u2227 p2 + p3 \u2227 p4 = p1 \u2227 p4 \u2212 p2 \u2227 p3\np1 \u2227 p3 + p2 \u2227 p4 = \u2212p1 \u2227 p4 \u2212 p2 \u2227 p3 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich follow directly from momentum conservation and the antisymmetry of the wedge\nproduct, and the consequent identity\ns(12) s(34) = s(13) s(24) \u2212 s(14) s(23) ,\n\n(9)\n\nthen leads to a cancellation of the O(s/m2Z ) terms. Unitarity is thus preserved at high\nenergies as expected for this scenario.

Again, for completeness, we have also studied the process\nAZL \u2192 AZL , and found that the leading O (s/m2Z ) terms cancel.\nWe therefore conclude that the additional complexities of direct product gauge groups\nand gauge boson mixing do not destroy our ability to maintain unitarity in NC processes\ncontaining longitudinal vector particles.\n\n17\n\n\fZ\u03bc\np1 \u057f\np2 \u0582\nZ\u03bd\n\nA\u03bc\n\u2190 p1\n\nZ\u03bc\n\u2190 p1\n\nZ\u03c3\n\u001a\n\u0580 p3 = \u22124ie2 (1 \u2212 3s2 c2 ) sin(p \u2227 p ) sin(p \u2227 p ) (g g \u2212 g g ) +\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\u03bc\u03c3 \u03bd\u03c1\n\u03bc\u03c1 \u03bd\u03c3\nW W\n\u0581 p4\nsin(p3 \u2227 p1 ) sin(p2 \u2227 p4 ) (g\u03bc\u03c1 g\u03bd\u03c3 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd g\u03c1\u03c3 ) +\n\u001b\nZ\u03c1\nsin(p1 \u2227 p4 ) sin(p2 \u2227 p3 ) (g\u03bc\u03bd g\u03c1\u03c3 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03c3 g\u03bd\u03c1 )\nZ\u03bd\n\u0580 p2\n\u0581 p3\nZ\u03c1\n\nZ\u03bd\n\u0580 p2\n\u0581 p3\nZ\u03c1\n\n= \u22122e sW cW sin(p1 \u2227 p2 ) [(p1 \u2212 p2 )\u03c1 g\u03bc\u03bd + (p2 \u2212 p3 )\u03bc g\u03bd\u03c1 + (p3 \u2212 p1 )\u03bd g\u03bc\u03c1 ]\n\n= \u22122e (s2W \u2212 c2W ) sin(p1 \u2227 p2 ) [(p1 \u2212 p2 )\u03c1 g\u03bc\u03bd + (p2 \u2212 p3 )\u03bc g\u03bd\u03c1 + (p3 \u2212 p1 )\u03bd g\u03bc\u03c1 ]\n\nZ\u03bc\nh\n\n\u0580 p1 = 2ie m cos(p \u2227 p )g\nZ\n1\n2 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u0581 p2\nZ\u03bd\nFigure 4: NC U(1) \u00d7 U(1) Feynman rules relevant for ZL ZL \u2192 ZL ZL .\n\n18\n\n\fZ1\n\nZ3\n\nZ1\n\nZ2\n\nZ4\n\nZ2\n\nA, Z\n\nZ3\n\nZ1\n\nZ4\n\nZ2\n\nZ3\nA, Z\nZ4\n\nZ1\nZ2\n\nZ1\n\nZ3\n\nZ1\n\nZ3\n\nZ1\n\nZ4\n\nZ2\n\nZ4\n\nZ2\n\nZ4\n\nZ2\n\nZ3\n\nZ4\nA, Z\nZ3\n\nFigure 5: Diagrams contributing to the scattering process ZL ZL \u2192 ZL ZL in NC U(1)\u00d7U(1);\nthe subscripts denote the momentum carried by the field.\n\n3.3\n\nU (2): Fundamental + Adjoint Breaking\n\nPerhaps unitarity was satisfied for the previous two test cases because both U(1) and U(1) \u00d7\nU(1) are abelian gauge groups. To address this issue, we study NC U(2) broken by both\na fundamental and an adjoint Higgs; this example furnishes the breaking of a non-abelian\ngauge group together with a more complicated example of mixing than that found in the\nU(1) \u00d7 U(1) case. It contains a two step symmetry breaking process akin to that used in the\nNCSM of [3] as well as a spectrum which closely resembles that in [3].

The\nspectrum of Sec. 3.3 consisted of a massless boson A and three massive bosons Z, W \u00b1 ; the\n23\n\n\feffect of the Higgsac here is to induce mixing between A and Z, leading to the following\ngauge sector spectrum:\n\nW\n\n\u00b1\n\n1\ng2\u03bd 2\n2\n\u221a\n,\n=\n(B1 \u2213 iB2 ) , mW =\n2\n2\n\nZ + = c\u03b1 Z + s\u03b1 A , m2+ = m2W (1 + sec (\u03b2) + tan (\u03b2)) ,\nZ \u2212 = c\u03b1 A \u2212 s\u03b1 Z , m2\u2212 = m2W (1 \u2212 sec (\u03b2) + tan (\u03b2)) .\n\n(22)\n\nHere s\u03b1 , c\u03b1 are shorthand for the mixing angles sin (\u03b1) , cos (\u03b1), and tan (\u03b2) is the ratio of\nthe Higgsac and fundamental Higgs vevs; the explicit expressions are given by\n\u2032\n\n\u03bd2\ntan (\u03b2) =\n,\n2\u03bd 2\n\u03b1 =\n\n\u03b2\n.\n2\n\n(23)\n\nUpon taking \u03b2 \u2192 0 we recover the case where NC U(2) is broken by just a fundamental\nHiggs; the Higgsac decouples. We know from the calculations in Sec. 3.3 that in this limit the\ntheory is unitary. To test the validity of using the Higgsac to break the NC U(1) subgroup\nwe must see whether we maintain a unitary theory for all values of \u03b2.\nWe again study the process WL+ WL\u2212 \u2192 WL+ WL\u2212 . This calculation requires the W \u00b1\nfour-point coupling and the h \u2212 W + \u2212 W \u2212 vertex, which are given Fig. 6, as well as the\nZ + \u2212W + \u2212W \u2212 and Z \u2212 \u2212W + \u2212W \u2212 vertices, which are presented in Fig. 8. The contributing\ndiagrams are displayed in Fig. 9. Notice that since the Higgsac couples only to Z \u00b1 , it does not\nenter into this calculation; this is to be contrasted with the model of Sec. 3.3, in which the\naddition of an adjoint Higgs generated additional diagrams which were required to maintain\nunitarity in WL+ WL\u2212 \u2192 WL+ WL\u2212 . Summing the contributions in Fig. 9, we find that the\nO (s2 /m4W ) terms cancel as expected as these terms arise from the pure gauge sector and are\n24\n\n\fnot affected by the details of the symmetry breaking. The O (s/m2W ) terms again split into\nthose which are proportional to c\u03b8 and those which are not, as in the previous examples.\nThese must cancel independently; for simplicity we list only the c\u03b8 independent terms below:\nig 2 s\niM =\n16 m2W\n\nm2\n6 exp (\u2212ip1 \u2227 p3 + ip2 \u2227 p4 ) \u2212 3 2+ c2\u03b1 exp (\u2212ip1 \u2227 p3 + ip2 \u2227 p4 )\nmW\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0010\n\n+s2\u03b1 exp (ip1 \u2227 p3 \u2212 ip2 \u2227 p4 ) \u2212 2c\u03b1 s\u03b1 c(13) c(24) \u2212 s(13) s(24)\n\n\u0011\u0015\n\nm2\n\u22123 2\u2212 c2\u03b1 exp (ip1 \u2227 p3 \u2212 ip2 \u2227 p4 ) + s2\u03b1 exp (\u2212ip1 \u2227 p3 + ip2 \u2227 p4 )\nmW\n\u0014\n\n\u0010\n\n+2c\u03b1 s\u03b1 c(13) c(24) \u2212 s(13) s(24)\n\n\u0011 \u0015\u001b\n\n+ c\u03b8 [. . .] .\n\n(24)\n\nIn obtaining this expression we have used the relations in Eq. 8. It is clear that this expression\ndoes not vanish for general \u03b2. As an example, let us examine an arbitrary case with tan (\u03b2) =\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3, s\u03b1 = 1/2, c\u03b1 = 3/2; with this choice of parameters the amplitude takes the very simple\nform\n\u221a\niM = 12 3 s(13) s(24) + c\u03b8 [. . .] .\n\n(25)\n\nThis clearly vanishes in the commutative limit when U(2) splits into the product of independent group factors SU(2)\u00d7U(1), but not in a general NC setting. In addition, we have found\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nthat a similar lack of cancellation of O s/m2\u2212 terms occurs in the process hZL\u2212 \u2192 hZL\u2212 .\nSince the difference between the previous test case, where unitarity was maintained, and the\none presented here was to trade an adjoint Higgs for a Higgsac in the symmetry breaking, we\nthus conclude that the use of the Higgsac representation in NC symmetry breaking induces\nunitarity violations in processes involving longitudinal gauge bosons.\nAs can be seen from the above discussion, our survey of toy models has allowed us to\nisolate the source of the tree-level unitarity breakdown in the proposed NCSM: the breaking\n25\n\n\fZ\u03c1+\n\u2190 p3\n\nZ\u03c1\u2212\n\u2190 p3\n\nW\u03bc\u2212\n\u0580 p1 = \u2212 \u221aig (c e\u2212ip1 \u2227p2 \u2212 s eip1 \u2227p2 ) [(p \u2212 p ) g + (p \u2212 p ) g + (p \u2212 p ) g ]\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n1\n2 \u03c1 \u03bc\u03bd\n2\n3 \u03bc \u03bd\u03c1\n3\n1 \u03bd \u03bc\u03c1\n2\n\u0581 p2\nW\u03bd+\n\nW\u03bc\u2212\n\u0580 p1 =\n\u0581 p2\n\nig\n\u221a\n2\n\n(c\u03b1 eip1 \u2227p2 + s\u03b1 e\u2212ip1 \u2227p2 ) [(p1 \u2212 p2 )\u03c1 g\u03bc\u03bd + (p2 \u2212 p3 )\u03bc g\u03bd\u03c1 + (p3 \u2212 p1 )\u03bd g\u03bc\u03c1 ]\n\nW\u03bd+\n\nFigure 8: Additional Feynman rules necessary for WL+ WL\u2212 \u2192 WL+ WL\u2212 in NC U(2) broken by\nboth a fundamental Higgs and Higgsac.\nof the symmetry by the Higgsac fields.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nThe straightforward construction of a NC version of the SM is made difficult by the requirements of gauge invariance and the constraints that arise from group theory. Once these\nconditions are met we expect any realistic perturbative NC model that reduces to the SM\nin the commutative limit to possess a number of essential properties in order to be a viable\ntheory and make phenomenological predictions: renormalizability, anomaly freedom, treelevel unitarity, etc. In this paper we have explicitly shown that the version of the NCSM\nconstructed by Chaichian et al.[3] does not satisfy the requirement of tree-level unitarity for\ngauge boson scattering at high energies. In order to track down the origin of this unitarity\nviolation we have examined a number of simpler NC gauge models with various gauge structures wherein the symmetry was spontaneously broken by various Higgs representations.\nIt was clear from this study that the use of the Higgsac representations to break the gauge\nsymmetries is the source of this unitarity violation. In the SM the mass relationship between\n26\n\n\fW1+\n\nW3+\n\nW1+\n\nW2\u2212\n\nW4\u2212\n\nW2\u2212\n\nW1+\nW2\u2212\n\nh\n\nZ +, Z \u2212\n\nW3+\n\nW1+\n\nW4\u2212\n\nW2\u2212\n\nW3+\n\nW1+\n\nW4\u2212\n\nW2\u2212\n\nh\n\nW3+\nZ +, Z \u2212\nW4\u2212\n\nW3+\nW4\u2212\n\nFigure 9: Diagrams contributing to the scattering process WL+ WL\u2212 \u2192 WL+ WL\u2212 in NC U(2)\nbroken by both a fundamental Higgs and Higgsac; the subscripts denote the momentum\ncarried by the field.\nthe W \u00b1 and Z fields as well as the Higgs exchanges ensures cancellations of the leading and\nsub-leading unitarity violating terms for this process. In the version of the NCSM discussed\nhere there are no relationships between the new gauge boson masses themselves or with those\nof the W \u00b1 and Z and there are no Higgsac contributions to induce cancellations. Since these\nm2G0 and m2W 0 terms are unavoidable in this approach unitarity must fail and this version of\nthe NCSM becomes phenomenologically unacceptable.\nIf Higgsac representations cannot be used in the symmetry breaking of the NCSM then\nwe are faced with a severe model construction problem. The use of products of U(n) groups,\nrequired by gauge invariance and algebraic closure in the Moyal approach, necessitates the\nbreaking of their U(1) subgroups as the first stage of symmetry breaking since they cannot\nbe identified with the U(1)Y gauge symmetry of the SM. As noted earlier, ordinary Higgs\nrepresentations such as fundamentals or adjoints will not break these U(1)'s but will instead\nbreak the SU(n) subgroups; this must be avoided. Using larger NC gauge groups does\nnot help the situation as fundamental and adjoint vevs only induce the breaking pattern\n27\n\n\fU(n) \u2192 U(n \u2212 1) instead of breaking to SU(n \u2212 1).\nWe thus conclude that it is difficult, if not impossible, to build a phenomenologically\nviable non-commutative Standard Model under the Weyl-Moyal approach.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Mohammad Sheikh-Jabbari for valuable discussions.
