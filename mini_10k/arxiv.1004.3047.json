Specifically, it has\nbeen reported that the renormalization of the electronic\ndispersion decreases with underdoping as half-filling is\napproached,1 i.e. the quasiparticles (QPs) seem to 'undress' in the underdoped regime. In sharp contrast, the\nspectral weight of the QPs fades away on approaching the\ninsulator and renormalizes to zero at half-filling2,3 , indicating that these QPs are very fragile or 'gossamer'-like4.\nWithin Fermi liquid theory the QP dispersion and spectral weight should be renormalized by the same factor,\nunless the self-energy has a strong momentum dependence. However, fluctuations in the cuprates seem to be\nrelatively isotropic5,6 , which would imply then that the\nrenormalization factor Zd for dispersion is roughly equal\nto the renormalization factor Z\u03c9 for the spectral weight.\nThis is clearly violated near the Mott insulating limit,\nwhere Zd \u2192 1 while Z\u03c9 \u2192 0. Added to these puzzling\nfindings is the fact that the electronic specific heat continues to behave more or less in a Fermi-liquid manner\nover the entire doping range from the overdoped metal to\nthe insulator3,7\u20139 . These results clearly demonstrate that\na non-Fermi-liquid or 'strange metal' superconductor\nemerges from the Fermi-liquid background as doping is\nreduced. Notably, there is considerable controversy over\nwhat constitutes non-Fermi-liquid behavior and many\nproposals have been made to understand its possible origin, ranging from preformed d\u2212wave pairs10 to fluctuating spin-density waves11 , from the Hubbard12,13 and\nt \u2212 J 14 models to the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS-CFT) correspondence15 .\nInsight into the origin of non-Fermi-liquid behav-\n\nior comes from recent angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES)16 , Hall effect17 , and quantum\noscillation18\u201320 experiments, which reveal the presence of\nFS reconstruction as a robust feature of both electron and\nhole doped cuprates, suggesting that the ground state involves some superlattice order. In this article, we investigate a model of the underdoped cuprates with a density\nwave ordered ground state and find that when the Fermi\nsurface (FS) breaks into pockets, the self-energy develops a strong momentum dependence. Analytic forms for\nvarious renormalization factors are presented to delineate\nhow the non-Fermi-liquid physics arising from FS reconstructions can be understood at a quantitative level. Our\nstudy thus provides a tangible model for reconciling the\nseemingly contradictory doping evolutions of the QP dispersion, the QP spectral weight and the specific heat in\nthe cuprates.\nThe possibility of FS reconstruction in the cuprates\nhas been proposed many times since it was found that\nthe Hall density scales with doping21 \u2013 i.e., it is proportional to the small pocket area rather than the large\nFS. We model this FS reconstruction by assuming a spin\ndensity wave (SDW) order which results in a nearlyantiferromagnetic-Fermi-liquid (NAFL) phase22 . In addition to SDW order, we have analyzed other candidates for the competing order including charge, flux, or\nd\u2212density waves23 and find that the pseudogap symmetry which is the essential ingredient for the origin of nonFermi-liquid physics is insensitive to the particular nature\nof the competing order state. We calculate the self-energy\ndue to spin and charge fluctuations within a QP-GW formalism described in Appendix A. The model is known to\nproperly describe the high-energy 'waterfall' features in\nARPES5,24,25 as well as the doping evolution of the optical spectra and the finite QP lifetime.26 Within the QPGW model the self-energy splits the spectrum into coherent in-gap states and an incoherent residue of the undoped upper and lower Hubbard bands (U/LHBs). With\nunderdoping, the in-gap states develop an SDW gap and\nsplit into upper and lower magnetic bands (U/LMBs)23 ,\n\n\f2\nand the resulting 'four-band' features are consistent with\nquantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations27 [Appendix\nA]. The involvement of a quantum critical point (QCP)\nin the optimal doping regime where the SDW order disappears is strongly suggestive of an intermediate strength\nfor correlations in the cuprates.26 Accordingly, there have\nbeen several recent attempts to develop an intermediate coupling model for the cuprates starting from either\nthe weak-coupling limit, as in the present calculation,\nor the strong-coupling limit28 . Therefore, we compare\nour results with experiments as well as with the variational cluster calculations of Paramekanti, Randeria and\nTrevedi (PRT)28 , which approach the problem from the\nRVB limit.\nThis article is organized as follows. In sections IIA and\nIIB, we investigate the doping evolution of the spectral\nweight and that of dispersion renormalization, respectively. The specific heat results are presented in Section\nIII. The discussion and conclusions are given in Sections\nIV and V respectively. A summary of the underlying QPGW model is provided in Appendix A. Various renormalization factors invoked are summarized in Appendix B for\nthe reader's convenience. Appendices C and D address\ndetails of analytic forms for the renormalization factors\nand those of our specific heat evaluation.\nII.\n\nNEARLY-ANTIFERROMAGNETIC-FERMILIQUID RENORMALIZTION\nFACTORS\nA.\n\nMomentum density and spectral weight\nrenormalization\n\nWe evaluate the exact values of the renormalization\nfactors from FS discontinuities of spectral function moments Ml (k) of various order l,\nZ \u221e\nd\u03c9\u03c9 l A(k, \u03c9)f (\u03c9)\n(1)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThese moments provide important information about the\nspectral weight distribution in energy and momentum\nspace as a function of doping.28 The spectral density\nA(k, \u03c9) involves both the coherent QP and the incoherent\npart. Due to the Fermi function f (\u03c9), the moments Ml\ndisplay singularities at the Fermi momentum kF which\nare characteristic of coherent gapless quasiparticle excitations. We consider first the zeroth order moment which\nis simply the momentum density n(k).29\u201331 The interacting FS is determined from the jump in n(k) at kF of the\nquasiparticles. The magnitude of this jump defines the\nspectral weight renormalization Z\u03c9 . The incoherent part\nin the spectral weight substantially modifies the shape of\nn(k).\nFig. 1 shows maps of n(k) throughout the first Brillouin zone as a function of doping for Nd2\u2212x Cex CuO4\n(NCCO) and hole doped La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO). In the\npresent NAFL case the combination of self-energy and\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Momentum density, n(k) as calculated\nusing Eq. 1 is shown for various dopings for NCCO in (a-c)\nand for LSCO in (d-f).\n\nSDW coherence factors leads to characteristic structures\nin n(k) at all dopings including half-filling. At halffilling n(k) shows a maximum at the \u0393\u2212point and away\nfrom that it decreases gradually and smoothly, from inside to outside the LDA-like FS [magenta solid line in\nFig. 1(a) and (d)]. As we dope the system with electrons, the spectral weight increases at the \u0393\u2212point and\nin addition, (\u03c0, 0) and its equivalent points largely gain\nspectral weight due to the development of electron pockets in NCCO [Fig. 1(b)]. With further increase of doping, the FS undergoes two topological transitions32,33 as\nalso reflected in the momentum density calculations here.\nThe first topological transition in n(k) occurs when the\nLMB approaches the Fermi level (EF ) and forms holelike pockets at (\u00b1\u03c0/2, \u00b1\u03c0/2). For x = 0.15, the hole\npockets are fully formed and they as well as the electron\npockets increase in size with further doping. At x = 0.18\nthe electron and hole pockets merge at the hot-spot, the\nSDW gap collapses, and the full metal-like n(k) appears\n[second topological transition]. For hole doping, the FS\ntopological transition is complimentary to the electron\ndoped one and here the hole pocket appears first as shown\nin Fig. 1(e) and above the QCP, the electron-like full FS\nappears in Fig. 1(f).\nA more quantitative account of the effect of self-energy\ncorrections on the residual coherent QP spectral weight\nis provided in Fig. 2(a), which shows n(k) along highsymmetry lines for NCCO as well as LSCO. Some important effects of correlations on the insulating state\nshould be noted here. At x = 0, n[k = \u0393] \u2248 0.9 and\nn[k = (\u03c0, \u03c0)] \u2248 0.1, implying that the self-energy redistributes the spectral weight from the filled states to the\nunfilled regions even in the insulating phase. PRT [with\na different parameter set t = 300 meV, t\u2032 = \u2212t/4 and\nU = 12t] find a similar result n[k = \u0393] \u2248 0.8528 . At\nhalf-filling n(k) is a smoothly varying function throughout the BZ, due to the absence of gapless quasiparticle for both NCCO (green line) and LSCO (not shown).\n\n\f3\nAs we increase electron doping, the spectral weight at \u0393\n[(\u03c0, \u03c0)] gradually increases [decreases] whereas the spectral weight increases rapidly at (\u03c0, 0), due to the development of electron pockets, while discontinuities in n(k)\narise at the Fermi surface. In the underdoped region,\nn(k) shows additional singularities along \u0393 \u2192 (\u03c0, 0)) and\n(\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) \u2192 (\u03c0, \u03c0) due to the presence of shadow bands\nas marked by gold arrows. Since the shadow bands are\nusually weak in the cuprates34\u201338 , experimental data are\navailable predominantly along the arcs \u2013 that is, along\nthe antinodal direction for NCCO and nodal direction for\nLSCO. These are compared with our theory in Fig. 2(b),\neffects of the ARPES matrix element notwithstanding.39\nWe define a coherent spectral weight renormalization\nfactor from the discontinuities in n(k):\nZ\u03c9 = \u2206n(kF ),\n\n(2)\n\nplotted as a function of doping for NCCO in Fig. 2(b)28 .\nFor the main band in NCCO along the antinodal direction, the UMB crosses the Fermi level at all finite dopings\n(electron pocket) and Z\u03c9 decreases smoothly with underdoping but vanishes discontinuously at x = 0. Shown\nalso in Fig. 2(b) is the conventional paramagnetic Green's\nfunction renormalization factor\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\n\u2202\u03a3\u2032 (\u03c9)\n0\n.\n(3)\nZ\u03c9 = 1 \u2212\n\u2202\u03c9\n\u03c9=0\nIt can be seen that the doping dependence in Z\u03c90 is very\nweak and strikingly opposite to Z\u03c9 . Thus the strong\ndoping dependence of Z\u03c9 is governed by the SDW gap\ncollapse. In Appendix C we derive an approximate analytical form for the SDW corrected renormalization factor\nZ\u03c9SDW (at \u03c9 = 0) in terms of the SDW coherence factors\n[see Eq. C6]\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u00132 !\u22121/2\n\u0012\n0\n2\u2206\nZ\n\uf8fb . (4)\nZ\u03c9SDW = \u03c9 \uf8f01 \u00b1 1 +\n2\n\u03bekF \u2212 \u03bekF +Q\n\nNote however that kF is the true Fermi momentum in\nthe SDW state, not the LDA one. We see in Fig 2(b)\nthat this simple analytic form captures the essential doping dependence of the full Z\u03c9 . As doping increases, the\nweight of the shadow bands (above the magnetic Brillouin zone) decreases [open symbols in Fig. 2(b)], with\nthe corresponding spectral weight shifting to the main\nbands. Along the nodal direction, Z\u03c9 remains zero up to\noptimal doping, and then shows a jump to a slowly increasing value as the LMB crosses the Fermi level. These\nresults are in excellent agreement with experiment16 .\nA similar doping dependence of Z\u03c9 is observed in\nLSCO along the nodal direction, including the jump at\nx = 0 and the spectral weight transfer from the shadow\nband to the main band34 in Fig. 2(b). This is in qualitative agreement with the calculation of PRT28 (triangles\nin Fig. 2(b)), and with ARPES measurements on LSCO3\n(open circles) above the optimal doping region. However,\n\nin the very underdoped region, the ARPES data seem to\nextrapolate smoothly to zero at half-filling (dashed line),\nwhich may be related to nanoscale phase separations believed to be significant in LSCO.\nNote that the analytic renormalization factor Z\u03c9SDW is\ndefined in the SDW phase, but is treated as a renormalization of the paramagnetic phase dispersion. This subtle\npoint is an attempt to treat the pseudogap physics, and\nis discussed in more detail in Section IV below.\n\nB.\n\nFERMI VELOCITY AND DISPERSION\nRENORMALIZATION\n\nWe turn next to the first order spectral moment M1 (k).\nOne can measure the dispersion renormalization from the\nsize of the slope discontinuity, which can be written as\n(Eq. C7)\n\u2206 (dM1 (k)/dk)kF = Z\u03c9 vF ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere vF is the Fermi velocity28 . Knowing Z\u03c9 from\nFigs. 2(b) and (c), we can extract vF as a function\nof doping, as seen in Fig. 3(a). The results are obtained for both LSCO and NCCO and compared with\nARPES data on LSCO3 and with PRT's variational\ncluster calculations28 (hole doping) as well as with LDA\nand mean-field theory for LSCO. Mean-field results for\nNCCO have an equivalent doping dependence and thus\nare not shown here. Notably, in spite of the substantial decrease of Z\u03c9 , the QP velocity vF does not diminish on entering into the pseudogap region. Although in\nthe SDW mean field case vF decreases smoothly with\nunderdoping as the gap grows, when a self-energy is introduced, the reduction of the coherent spectral weight\n(Z\u03c9 ) with underdoping compensates for this, leading to a\nnet enhancement of vF . The results are consistent with\nPRT and ARPES. Similar results are also obtained in\na self-consistent Born approximation with antiferromagnetic pseudogap in the t \u2212 J model41 .\nWe define a dispersion renormalization factor in terms\nof the conventional band velocity with respect to its bare\n(LDA) counterpart (vF0 ) as\nZd = vF /vF0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nplotted in Figs. 3(a).

Since this self energy is approximately kindependent, one finds Zd0 \u2248 Z\u03c90 . In sharp contrast, the\ncalculated Zd [Fig. 3(b)] shows a strikingly opposite doping dependence to Z\u03c9 .

The red dashed line shows that in underdoped LSCO \u03b3 scales linearly with doping. Theoretical\n\u03b3 has been scaled by a factor of 1.1, consistent with a weak\nelectron-phonon renormalization.\n\nstate including the self-energy correction is given in Appendix D. We find that the Sommerfeld coefficient \u03b3 can\nbe well described in terms of the density of state (DOS)\n(N (0)) in the SDW state as44 ,\n\u03b3 = cV (T )/T \u2248\n\n2\n2\u03c0 2 kB\nN (0)/Z\u03c90 ,\n3\n\n(9)\n\nwhere N0 (0) is the mean-field DOS with SDW gap but\nwithout self energy corrections.\nFig. 4 compares experimental values of \u03b3 as a function\nof doping in LSCO3,7 and electron doped NCCO8 and\nPr1\u2212x LaCex CuO4 (PLCCO)9 with several calculations\nincluding bare LDA, MFT results with SDW gap, and\nwith self-energy correction for both NCCO and LSCO.\nThe striking differences between NCCO and LSCO away\nfrom half-filling are due to the presence of the van-Hove\nsingularity (VHS) near EF in the latter case. N (0)\nin LDA thus decreases (from a finite value at x = 0)\nwith increasing electron doping, whereas for LSCO N (0)\nhas a peak at the doping corresponding to the VHS\nxV HS \u223c 0.201 . SDW order opens a gap, reducing N (0),\nand introduces steps associated with the collapse of the\nSDW gap. Thus, for electron doping N (0) is nearly flat\n\nfor x < 0.11, reflecting the quasi-two dimensionality of\nthe electron pocket (constant DOS) in cuprates. The step\nat x \u223c 0.11 signals the appearance of the hole pocket.\nSimilarly in LSCO the appearance of the electron pocket\nnear (\u03c0, 0) at x \u2248 0.17 within our model greatly enhances\nthe VHS features. Finally, adding self-energy corrections\n(in the form of 1/Z\u03c90 ) preserves the general shape of the\nSDW \u03b3, while shifting its magnitude back towards the\nLDA values. It is interesting to relate the doping dependence of \u03b3(0) and Z\u03c9 in Fig. 2(b). Note that Z\u03c9\nis evaluated at a particular Fermi momentum whereas\n\u03b3(0) is computed after summing over Z\u03c9 at all kF . As\nZ\u03c9 exhibits complimentary doping dependencies for main\nand shadow bands, so the total remains fairly constant.\nThese results are in striking contrast to the strong coupling limit where \u03b3 should diverge with the effective mass\nas x \u2192 0.45\nThe agreement with experiment is quite good in LSCO\nfor x \u2265 0.10, including the strong VHS feature. Interestingly, the superfluid density ns and the paramagnetic\nsusceptibility data, which are proportional to the total\nFS areas, show a similar doping dependence to \u03b3. However, below x = 0.10 \u03b3 \u2192 0 as x \u2192 0, an effect not\ncaptured by our calculations. Such an effect could be\ndue to a Coulomb gap7 and/or nanoscale phase separation. The linear dashed line in Fig. 3(b) illustrates the\ncorrected form expected in the latter case. Note that\nnanoscale phase separation would produce the dashed\nline seen in Fig. 2(c) as well as explain the anomalous\ndoping dependence of the chemical potential.46 Hence\nthe enhanced gossamer features seen in LSCO may be\nrelated to nanoscale phase separation.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe present calculations are most appropriate for electron doping, where only the (\u03c0, \u03c0) commensurate SDW\norder is observed, and the model is in very good agreement with experiment. Remarkably, the same model\nwhen applied to hole-doped cuprates describes many aspects of the two-gap scenario23,47 , despite the fact that\nit does not capture the incommensurate magnetization.\nThe non-Fermi-liquid behavior presented here is not sensitive to the specifics of the competing order, but only\nto the resulting superlattice q-vector. We have analyzed other candidates for the competing order including charge, flux, or d\u2212density waves23, and find that the\nresults are insensitive to the nature of the competing order state. Thus, Eqs. 4 and 8 continue to hold for any\nQ = (\u03c0, \u03c0) order, as long as the appropriate gap \u2206 is\nused.\nIn the presence of long-range magnetic order, the\nGreen's function develops a second pole, and should\nproperly be treated as a tensor. However, the pseudogap\nphase is more likely to be associated with only short range\norder, in which case the second pole does not cross the\nreal axis, the Green's function can be treated as a scalar,\n\n\f6\n\nV.\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\nU (eV)\n\n0.7\nZ\n\nand the information about incipient gap formation is encoded in the self-energy.48 The analytic approximations of\nEqs. 4 and 8 mimic this effect by treating the renormalization factors as acting on the paramagnetic dispersion\n\u03bek , with information on proximity to long-range magnetic\norder encoded into Z\u03c9SDW and ZdSDW .\nThis approach is similar to the phenomenological\nmodel introduced by Yang et al.49 to describe RVB\nphysics. Indeed, their phenomenological self energy is\nquite similar to the form expected for a NAFL, except for\nthe treatment of scattering at the magnetic zone boundary, which splits the pockets expected for AF order into\ntwo half-pockets. One puzzle is that the effect of strong\nscattering at a superlattice zone boundary is already\nwell understood in standard Lifshitz-Kosevich theory50 ,\nwhere it leads to a quantum switching between arcs of\nFermi surface. This produces harmonic mixing frequencies in a quantum oscillation (QO) spectrum, and it is\nhard to see how it could evolve into the short-circuiting\neffect of Yang, et al. At any rate, the QOs observed in\nNCCO are more consistent with the present model.19\n\n0.6\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nU\n(b)\nZU\nMFT\n\n1\n0.0\n\nx\n\n0.1\nx\n\n0.2\n\nFIG. 5: (color online) (a) Average renormalization factor Z\ndecreases linearly with doping, very much like Z\u03c90 in Figs. 2(b)\nand (c). (b) Our computed doping dependence of selfconsistent values of U and ZU is compared with earlier mean field\nresults32,60 .\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that a number of salient\nfeatures of the non-Fermi-liquid state of the underdoped\ncuprates can be understood within the framework of a\ncompeting density wave order, which breaks the particlehole symmetry, and drives reconstruction of the FS. We\nprovide a transparent and analytic basis for describing\nhow the non-Fermi-liquid effects play out in renormalizing spectral weight via Z\u03c9 and electronic dispersion\nvia Zd , and how they conspire to yield a specific heat\nin the cuprates which is essentially conventional in nature at all dopings. Our framework would provide a\nstraightforward basis for understanding how the brokensymmetry order leads to 'non-Fermi-liquid' effects, not\nonly in the cuprates, but also in heavy-fermions51, Febased superconductors52 and other strongly correlated\nmaterials.\n\nFIG. 6: (color online) (a) Spectral intensity as a function of\n\u03c9 along the high-symmetry lines for several dopings (at temperature T = 0).

At each step, we adjust the chemical potential\nEF to fix the doping.

The\ndoping dependence of the on-site Hubbard U is obtained\ndue to charge screening from U = hV (q)/(1 + V (q)\u03c7(q)i,\nwhere V (q) is the long-range Coulomb interaction59 ,\nand \u03c7(q) is the charge susceptibility in the \u03c6\u2212gapped\nstate defined below.

A3 in both\nG and \u03c70 . This generally leads to problems unless a\nvertex correction \u0393 is included. Improved results are\noften found by using a 'bare' G0 and \u03c70 \u2013 bare in the\nsense of not including \u03a3. This latter G0 W0 \u2212scheme\nalso fails in the present calculation by producing too\nlarge a renormalization of the band dispersion. This is\nbecause the imaginary part of the bare susceptibility\nhas the form \u03c7\u2032\u20320 \u223c \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 [\u03bek+q \u2212 \u03bek ]), so that near\nthe Fermi surface, \u03c7\u2032\u20320 should scale in frequency with\nthe dressed quasiparticle dispersion. Since G0 W0 uses\nthe bare dispersions, peaks in \u03c7\u2032\u20320 , which control the\nrenormalization, lie at too high an energy.\nWe therefore introduce a modified, or 'quasiparticle'\n(QP) GW approximation5 for the right-hand side (RHS)\nof Eq. A3, as follows. In Eq. A3, we dress both G0 and\n\u03c70 with an 'input' self-energy chosen as\n\u03a3\u0303(i\u03c9n ) = (1 \u2212 1/Z)i\u03c9n 1\u0303.\n\n(A5)\n\nThus, the input \u03a3 contains a single parameter Z, which\ngives an overall renormalization of the 'input' dispersions\n(RHS of Eq. A3).

A8 can be derived\nusing the translational symmetry with respect to q.\nA limitation of the present scheme is also apparent\nfrom Eq. A3. This self-energy is a good approximation\nfor the coherent, dressed bands, but does not extend to\nthe incoherent part of the spectrum, thereby underestimating the incoherent spectral weight. We have empirically found that this can be partly remedied by incorporating a vertex function \u0393. Consistent with the QP\napproximation, the vertex correction to the self-energy is\nobtained through Ward's identity as\n\u0393(k, q, i\u03c9n , \u03c9p ) = 1 \u2212 (\u2202\u03a3\u2032 /\u2202\u03c9)\u03c9=\u03c90 = 1/Z.(A10)\nEven though we have chosen perhaps the simplest form of\nthe vertex correction, it has a large impact on the spectral\nweight transfer. \u0393 = 1/Z eventually reduces the renormalization of the bare susceptibility in Eq. A3 and hence\nthe spectral weight is spread out more towards higher\nenergies, enhancing the incoherent spectral weight. An\nillustration of the importance of this vertex correction is\ngiven in Fig. 6(b).\nNext we discuss our self-consistent scheme, and explain how the parameter Z is chosen. We choose Z to\nmatch the average renormalization in the low-energy (coherent) part of the spectrum. Specifically, if \u03a3\u2032 is the\nreal part of the diagonal self energy, then we adjust Z\nself-consistently until it satisfies Z = (1 \u2212 \u2202\u03a3\u2032 /\u2202\u03c9)\u22121\n\u03c9=\u03c9o ,\n\n\f8\n(a)\n\n0.4\n\n0.00\n\u22120.25\n\n\u03a30\n\u03a31\n\n\u03a32\n\u03a33\n\n\u03a3\u2032\u2032 [eV]\n\n\u03a3\u2032 [eV]\n\n0.25\n\n(b)\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\u03c9 [eV]\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFIG. 7: (color online) Real and imaginary part of the selfenergy as expanded in the tight-binding form of Eq. A11.\n\nwhere \u03c9o is an average quasiparticle excitation energy,\nwhich is related to the poles in G. This gives a good selfconsistent result for the coherent spectral weight in the\nlow-energy region (see Fig. 6(a)), whereas the incoherent\nparts in the higher energy regions are not self-consistent.\nThus our scheme is in the spirit of Landau's quasiparticles, except that Landau assumed that all of the spectral\nweight goes into the QP band, while we have only a fraction Z.\nWhen this is done, we find that U is effectively further\nrenormalized by the doping dependent Z [Fig. 5(a)], so\nthat the product U \u03c70 is approximately independent of Z.\nThe resulting ZU closely resembles our earlier mean-field\ncalculations as shown in Fig. 5(b).\nLastly, we find that the momentum dependence of the\nfluctuation self-energy \u03a3 is relatively weak5,6 . To emphasize this point, we expanded the momentum dependence\nof the self energy in a form similar to the tight-binding\nmodel:\n\u03a3(\u03c9, k) = \u03a30 (\u03c9) + \u03a31 (\u03c9) (cx + cy )\n+\u03a32 (\u03c9)cx cy + \u03a33 (\u03c9) (c2x + c2y ) ,(A11)\nwhere c\u03b1(x/y) = cos (\u03b1k(x/y) a).\nWe calculate the\nself-energy at four high symmetry points k =\n(0, 0), (\u03c0, 0), (\u03c0, \u03c0) and (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) to obtain the above\ncoefficients as shown in Fig. 7.\nClearly, only the\nk\u2212independent part (red line) has a strong contribution.\nTherefore, we have simplified the self-energy calculation\nby approximating it with a k-independent average value\ntaken as the value at k = (\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2). Since we are neglecting the k\u2212dependence of the self energy, \u03a311 = \u03a322\nand \u03a312 = \u03a321 .\nFigure 8(a) shows that in the QP-GW scheme the spectral weight splits up into four band-like features. The two\nbands closer to the Fermi level are the UMB and LMB,\nassociated with the development of the spin-density wave\n(SDW). The residual incoherent spectral dispersions at\nhigher energies are the UHB and LHB. Similar four band\nfeatures are found in the variational cluster calculations\nshown in Fig. 8(b)27 . The corresponding density of states\n(DOS) shows four peaks associated with these four bands,\nFigs. 8(c)-(f). These four band features separated by\nSDW gap or 'waterfall' effects show semi-quantitative\nagreement with QMC results6,61 . With doping, the two\nmagnetic bands merge in a QCP near optimal doping,\n\nFIG. 8: (color online) (a) The spectral intensity of NCCO at\nx = 0, plotted (in logarithmic scale) along the high-symmetry\nlines, is compared with variational calculations27 in (b). (c)(f) The computed DOS at various dopings are compared\nwith the corresponding QMC results (blue lines) for x = 0.0\n[Ref. 61] and for x = 0.05 to x = 0.20 [Ref. 6].\n\nwhile the two Hubbard bands occur at the top and bottom of the LDA bands, and hence the associated Hubbard band splitting is comparable to the LDA bandwidth\nat all dopings.\nAppendix B: Summary of renormalization factors\n\nWe summarize the various renormalization factors that\narise in this study for convenience reference.

Even though\nwe assume a k\u2212independent self-energy and thus Zk0 = 1\nfrom Eq.

Since the high energy\nkink energies for cuprates are around 0.3 to 0.6 eV, the\nkink should appear in cV only at a very high temperature,\nTk \u223c 103 K.

A more realistic treatment of the doping dependence of the electronic states (see,\ne.g., Refs. 55\u201357) was not undertaken. However, we expect\nthe rigid band model to be a good approximation for doping away from the Cu-O planes.\nA. Bansil, Zeitschrift Naturforschung A 48, 165 (1993); A.\nBansil, Phys. Rev.
