Bar\nformation is attributed to one of two possible mechanisms; bars\ncan form spontaneously as a result of an intrinsic gravitational\ninstability, or they can be produced by tidal disturbance of the\ngalactic potential during an interaction. Both mechanisms are supported by numerical simulations. Massive stellar disks with small\nvelocity dispersions are intrinsically unstable to bar formation\nand will develop a strong bar structure without external perturbation within a few rotation periods (e.g., Athanassoula & Sellwood\n1986). Similarly, external perturbations can induce bar structures\nin galactic disks that are stable in isolation (e.g., Noguchi 1987;\nGerin, Combes & Athanassoula 1990; Mihos & Hernquist 1996,\nhereafter MH96).\nObservationally, Keel et al. (1996) used K-band images to\nstudy the bar fraction in a sample of pairs, finding 80% of the pairs\nto display signs of bar formation. Elmegreen, Elmegreen & Bellin\n(1990) also find a high fraction of barred galaxies in binary systems\n(50\u00b15%), higher than in the field (32\u00b19%) or group environments\n(28 \u00b1 2%). However, van den Bergh (2002), using a sample of 930\ngalaxies found no evidence for a dependence of bar frequency on\ngalaxy environment, consistent with the nature of the host galaxy\n\nbeing the most important factor in bar formation. Taken together\nthese results suggest that bar formation is strongly dependent on\nthe host galaxy, but that pair-wise interactions do induce bars in\nmany systems.\nGalaxy bars represent a principal mode of disruption to the\naxisymmetric potential of spiral galaxies, providing a mechanism\nof gas inflow toward the central regions. The simulations of Mihos\n(1994) and MH96 indicate that bars can play a particularly important role in fly-by encounters, where they provide a dominant trigger for central gas concentration and ensuing star formation. In addition, the high proportion of galaxies in the local universe hosting\nbars (Eskridge et al. 2000; Menendez-Delmestre et al. 2004) means\nthat the response of a barred potential to an external perturbation is\nalso of interest. The relationship between bars and interactions and\nthe evolution of the ISM in barred systems is crucial in attaining a\nbetter understanding of the star formation response of interacting\ngalaxies.\nBoth theoretical (MH96) and observational (Sakamoto et al.\n1999a; Sheth et al. 2005) evidence exists pointing to enhanced\nmolecular gas concentration in barred systems (at least in earlytype spirals). However, the relationship between bars and star formation remains less clear. Whilst bars do not appear to affect the\ndisk-wide star-formation properties of galaxies, they can be important in triggering enhanced star formation in the central regions (for\n\n\f2\n\nH. Cullen et al.\n\na review see Kennicutt 1994). Star formation in barred galaxies\nmanifests itself in a diverse range of morphologies (Phillips 1996;\nSheth et al. 2000, 2002). A number of studies point to an enhanced\nlevel of star formation in the central region of early-type barred\nsystems, although similar enhancements are not observed in latetype systems (Huang et al. 1996; Ho et al. 1997). This distinction\nis consistent with molecular gas observations. Bars may well play\na particularly important role in the evolution of the most actively\nstar-forming systems. Phillips (1996) examined the LFIR /LB ratio\nin a sample of IR-bright galaxies and only detected a difference between the barred and non-barred systems for the most actively starforming galaxies. Similarly, Hunt & Malkan (1999) found a higher\nincidence of bars in starburst galaxies, and Hawarden et al. (1986),\nwho looked at the properties of intrinsically luminous galaxies, detected a mean IR luminosity three times larger in barred systems\nthan their unbarred counterparts.\nIn this paper we examine the spatial and kinematic distribution of both the atomic and molecular gas associated with\nNGC 5218, the late-type barred spiral galaxy in the spiral\u2013\nelliptical interacting pair Arp 104. This is one of a small\nsample of nine spiral\u2013elliptical interacting pairs, which have\nbeen studied by Cullen, Alexander & Clemens (2003, 2006) and\nCullen & Alexander (2005). Each pair has an H I flux of at least\n5 Jy km s\u22121 , and Arp 104 has a relatively large separation between\nthe galaxies, implying they are in the early state of interaction. We\nuse these data in conjunction with N-body simulations and data\nprobing the star formation properties of this system to assess the\nimpact of the bar on NGC 5218's evolution, and look at the extent\nto which the tidal interaction may have been important in triggering its bar. In Section 2 we present details of our H I and CO observations. In Section 3 we discuss the star-formation properties and\nefficiency of NGC 5218 and present the results of the simulations.\nIn Section 4 we examine the importance of the bar in this galaxy. In\nSection 5 we discuss our results, looking first at the importance of\nthe bar in terms of NGC 5218's evolution and subsequently at the\nlikelihood that the bar has been triggered by the tidal interaction.\n\n2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n2.1 Optical morphology of Arp 104\nArp 104, shown in Fig. 1, consists of two interacting galaxies, see\nNED1 : the southern galaxy, NGC 5216, is an E0 pec (2.\u2032 5\u00d71.\u2032 5) and\nthe northern galaxy, NGC 5218, is an SB(s)b? pec (1.\u2032 8\u00d71.\u2032 3). At an\nassumed distance of 41.1 Mpc (from a recessional velocity of 2880\nkm s\u22121 , and using a Hubble constant of 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ), the\nprojected major axis diameter (D25 ) is 29.9 kpc (2.\u2032 5) for NGC 5216\nand 21.5 kpc (1.\u2032 8) for NGC 5218. The projected separation of\nthe two galaxies is 49.1 kpc. Schombert, Wallin & Struck-Marcell\n(1990) have conducted a multicolour photometric study of the optical tidal features of a sample of interacting galaxies, including\nArp 104. They found the tidal features of Arp 104 are bluer than\nthe central regions of both NGC 5218 and NGC 5216, but similar\nto the colours of the outer disk in NGC 5218.\n2.2 VLA 21-cm observations\nThe H I observations of Arp 104 were made with the VLA in Carray configuration on 1994 December 24 and in D-array on the\n1\n\nsee http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\n1995 March 22. Both datasets were retrieved from the VLA archive\nand analysed. For both the C- and D-array observations, a correlator mode with online Hanning smoothing giving 63 channels with\na velocity width per channel of 10.3 km s\u22121 (48.8 kHz) was used.\nBoth sets of observations were centred on RA 13h 32m 09.s 36, Dec\n+62\u25e6 44\u2032 03.\u2032\u2032 3 (J2000), at a heliocentric radial velocity of 2900\nkm s\u22121 . The total on-source integration times were 258 and 236\nminutes for the C and D-array observations respectively. In both\ncases on-source scans were interleaved with those of the phase calibrator, 1400+621. For the C-array observations both 3C48 and\n3C286 were observed as flux calibrators during the observations,\nwith assumed flux densities of 16.0 and 14.8 Jy respectively. For\nthe D-array observations 3C286 was used as the flux calibrator with\nan assumed flux density of 14.8 Jy.\nData reduction followed standard procedures using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Astronomical Image\nProcessing System (AIPS). After flagging, the data were binned\nto velocity resolution of 20.7 km s\u22121 to improve the signal to\nnoise. Subtraction of the average of the line-free channels from\nall channels was used to remove the continuum emission. AIPS\ntask IMAGR was used to produce naturally-weighted channel maps\nwith an angular resolution 21.\u2032\u2032 3 \u00d7 16.\u2032\u2032 4 for the C-array data and\n63.\u2032\u2032 9 \u00d7 54.\u2032\u2032 4 for the D-array data.\n\n2.3 GMRT H I absorption observations\nIn addition to the H I images from the VLA observations,\nNGC 5218 was also observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) on 2003 October 16 to obtain an H I absorption spectra towards its nuclear continuum emission. The GMRT\nis an aperture synthesis telescope comprising of thirty 45-m dishes\n(Rao 2002). The full width half maximum of the primary beam of\nthe telescope at 1.4 GHz is \u223c 25\u2032 . The backend setup employed\nwas a 30 station FX correlator with 128 spectral channels over a\n4 MHz bandwidth (857 km s\u22121 ), giving a resolution of 31.25 kHz.\nThe observations were centred at a heliocentric radial velocity of\n2880 km s\u22121 . The total integration time on source was 174 minutes. On-source scans were interleaved with those of the phase calibrator, 1313+675. 3C286 was used as a flux calibrator with an\nassumed flux density of 14.8 Jy. The pointing centre was the core\nof NGC 5218: RA 13h 32m 10.s 50, Dec +62\u25e6 46\u2032 04.\u2032\u2032 0 (J2000).\nThese data were binned to a velocity resolution of 40 km s\u22121 and\nchannel maps made using natural weighting, giving a spatial resolution of 7.\u2032\u2032 72 \u00d7 4.\u2032\u2032 60. The flux density of the continuum source\nis approximately 25 mJy, consistent with the FIRST observation\n(White et al. 1997).\n\n2.4\n\n12 CO\n\n(J = 1\u22120) observations\n\nObservations of NGC 5218 in the 12 CO (J = 1\u22120) line at\n115.27 GHz were made using the 10-element Berkeley\u2013Illinois\u2013\nMaryland Association (BIMA) millimeter interferometer. Two usable tracks were observed in C-configuration on 2003 April 28 and\nMay 13. The BIMA correlator was configured to have a resolution of 1.56 MHz (4 km s\u22121 ) over a total bandwidth of 368 MHz\n(959 km s\u22121 ). The primary beam at BIMA at this frequency is\n100\u2032\u2032 FWHM. 3C84 and 1638+573 were observed for passband\nand phase calibration respectively. Data calibration was performed\nin Miriad (Sault, Teuben & Wright 1995).

Contour levels are (0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.125, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4) Jy beam\u22121 km s\u22121 .\n\n2.5\n\n12 CO\n\n(J = 2\u22121) observations\n\nObservations of the 12 CO (J = 2\u22121) emission of NGC 5218 at\n230.54 GHz were made with the JCMT in 'service' mode on 2001\nNovember 30 and 2003 January 4. Observations were made on\na 9 \u00d7 5 grid in RA and Dec, with 10\u2032\u2032 spacing, centred at RA\n13h 32m 11.s 8, Dec +62\u25e6 46\u2032 05\u2032\u2032 (J2000). The 10\u2032\u2032 spacing of\ngrid points produced a fully-sampled map over the area observed\n(JCMT beam 20.\u2032\u2032 8 at 230.54 GHz). Sky subtraction was achieved\nby beam switching to a point 80\u2032\u2032 in declination from the reference\nposition. Observations were centred on a heliocentric radial velocity of 2880 km s\u22121 with a bandwidth of 920 MHz (1200 km s\u22121 ),\nsplit into channels separated by 625 kHz. The spectra were binned\nto a velocity resolution of 20.9 km s\u22121 to match that of the VLA\ndata.\nStandard calibration observations were made at the same time\nas the observations of NGC 5218. Data calibration followed the\nstandard JCMT procedure, adopting the beam efficiency and forward scattering efficiency on the JCMT website yielding an \u03b7fss\nof 0.77. To convert between main beam temperature and flux it\nwas assumed that the 12 CO (J = 2\u22121) emission could be modelled\nas a point source. Whilst this is not strictly the case, it allows a\n\nlower limit to be placed on the 12 CO (J = 2\u22121) flux for NGC 5218.\nThe conversion between flux and main beam temperature, assuming a point source, is given by (S/Jy) = 18.4(Tmb /K) (assuming\nthe FWHM of the JCMT beam at 230 GHz is 20.\u2032\u2032 8).\n\n3 RESULTS\n3.1 Star-formation rate\nThe flux densities of NGC 5218 at 12, 25, 60 and 100 \u03bc m, taken\nfrom the IRAS High Resolution Image Restoration Atlas (Cao et al.\n1997), are 0.36, 0.92, 7.14 and 14.38 Jy respectively. This yields\na far-infrared (FIR) luminosity (40\u2212122 \u03bc m, Helou et al. 1988) of\n8.37\u00d71036 W (2.2\u00d71010 L\u2299 ). Using the calibration of Bell (2003)\nwe obtain a FIR star-formation rate (SFR) of 5.3 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The\ninfrared luminosity (8\u22121000 \u03bc m) for NGC 5218 is 3.96 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299\n(Perault 1987).\nBoth NGC 5218 and NGC 5216 have detected radio continuum emission recorded by the NVSS survey (Condon et al. 1998),\nwith 30.4 and 31.8 mJy respectively. The NVSS flux density of\nNGC 5218 corresponds to a luminosity of 6.16\u00d71021 W Hz\u22121 .\nUsing the radio SFR calibration of Bell (2003) this yields a SFR\n\n\f4\n\nH.

The colour scale goes from 2716 (blue) to 3093 km s\u22121 (red) and contour levels are (2760, 2780, 2800 . . . 3100) km s\u22121 .\n\nof 3.4 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , a factor of \u223c 2 below the SFR obtained using the\ncalibration of Condon (1992) (7.6 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ). For the purposes of\nthis work we adopt the FIR estimated SFR of 5.3 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n\n3.2 Atomic Hydrogen\nThe combined VLA C- and D-array H I map of Arp 104 (Fig. 1)\nreveals a tidal tail to the north-east of the late-type system\n(NGC 5218), and a tidal bridge extending southward toward the\nearly-type companion (NGC 5216). Figure 1, like the other H I and\nCO results shown here, has not been corrected for the primary beam\nof the telescope, which is much larger than the scale of the emission\nthat is seen. The tidal tail to the north-east forms a quarter-circle arc\nwith a radius of approximately 4\u2032 , corresponding to a physical radius of 48 kpc. The tidal bridge to the south is approximately 5\u2032\nlong, corresponding to a physical length of 60 kpc. The bridge is\noriented directly toward the elliptical, NGC 5216, with a small tail\nextending beyond the elliptical to the south-west.\nUsing the lower resolution D-array data we detect an H I flux\nabove a level of 0.035 Jy beam\u22121 km s\u22121 over an area of approximately 37 arcmin2 . At a distance of 41 Mpc, this corresponds to\na physical area of 5360 kpc2 . The detected flux in this low resolu-\n\ntion map peaks at 0.98 Jy beam\u22121 km s\u22121 , falling to around 0.05\nJy beam\u22121 km s\u22121 in the more extended regions of the tidal tail.\nThe total H I flux of the Arp 104 system, obtained by adding\nall the flux in the low-resolution channel maps is 7.0 \u00b1 0.5 Jy\nkm s\u22121 , which is in good agreement with the single-dish flux,\n7.7 \u00b1 2.4 Jy km s\u22121 (Theureau et al. 1998). The H I mass, given\nby\nMH I = 2.36 \u00d7 105 D2\n\nZ\n\nS dv\n\nM\u2299 ,\n\nis (2.8 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 109 M\u2299 .\nApproximately 30% of the H I emission detected in the Darray map appears to be associated with the late-type system,\nNGC 5218, with the remainder forming an extended tidal tail.\nThis is consistent with the trend found by Hibbard & van Gorkom\n(1996). For a sample of four galaxies (Arp 295b, NGC 4676a, NGC\n4676b and NGC 520) considered to lie in the central region of the\nmerger sequence, they find \u223c 35% of the total atomic gas emission\ncomes from the inner regions of the system; this percentage falls\ndramatically for more advanced mergers.\nChannel maps of the H I emission are shown in Fig. 2,\nwhilst Fig. 3 displays the intensity weighted mean velocity field of\nArp 104.

The northern tidal tail has\na velocity dispersion of \u223c 270 km s\u22121 with velocities in the range\n2821\u22123094 km s\u22121 . The tidal bridge to the south has a slightly\nsmaller velocity dispersion of \u223c 210 km s\u22121 , with velocities in the\nrange 2800\u22123010 km s\u22121 . The largest velocity dispersion is observed for the gas still associated with NGC 5218. Here velocities\nrange from 2716\u22123094 km s\u22121 with the western side blueshifted.\nThe central region of NGC 5218 is seen in absorption due\nto the presence of a bright radio continuum source in NGC 5218\n(see Fig. 4). The absorption profile is centred on a velocity of 2884\nkm s\u22121 . The detected H I emission believed to be still bound to the\nlate-type system is distributed approximately symmetrically about\nthis velocity. In contrast, emission from tidal material is mostly redshifted.\nThe depth of the H I absorption feature give an optical depth\nof 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 with a linewidth of 80 km s\u22121 . Assuming a spin\ntemperature of 100 K, this corresponds to an H I column density\nof (1.5 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . If the continuum source is located in\nthe centre of the galaxy we would observe approximately half of\nthe H I along the line of sight in absorption. This implies a total H I\ncolumn density through the centre of the disk of (3.0 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 1021\ncm\u22122 .\n\n3.3 Molecular Gas\nNaturally weighted BIMA data were used to produce an image\ncube with a synthesised beam of \u03b8FWHM = 8.\u2032\u2032 8 \u00d7 5.\u2032\u2032 3, corresponding to a physical scale of \u223c1.4 kpc. Figure 5 shows the integrated\n12 CO (J = 1\u22120) map overlayed on digitised sky survey B-band\nimage. The CO data reveal four distinct peaks. The central peak is\nsignificantly brighter than the peaks observed offset to the east and\nwest, its emission exceeding that in the eastern and western peaks\nby a ratio of 10 : 1 and 7 : 1 respectively.\nWhilst the molecular gas emission in NGC 5218 is clearly\ncentrally condensed there is also a sizeable extended component.\nThe central peak itself is extended in the easterly direction, well\naligned with the optical bar axis. Examining the subsidiary peaks\nin the molecular gas, there is a clear peak located toward the eastern end of the bar, whilst at the western end there is a larger area\nof emission extending from the bar end toward a region of star formation in the spiral arm. There is similarly a peak in the eastern\n\n13 32 15\n\n10\nRight Ascension\n\n05\n\nFigure 5.

The molecular gas mass was estimated in solar masses from\nthe integrated 12 CO (J = 1\u22120) flux using the empirical relation:\nMH2 = 1.6 \u00d7 109 \u03bb 2 D2\n\nZ\n\nS dv\n\nM\u2299\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength\nin metres, D is the distance in megaR\nparsecs to the source, S dv is the integrated CO flux in Jy km s\u22121\nand CO-to-H2 conversion factor, X \u2261 N(H2 )/ICO = 2.8 \u00d7 1020\ncm\u22122 K km s\u22121 has been assumed (Bloemen et al. 1986). The\nobserved integrated flux of 375 \u00b1 75 Jy km s\u22121 is in good agreement with single-dish observations of Zhu et al. (1999), who obtained 363 \u00b1 27 Jy km s\u22121 , which implies that the BIMA observations are not missing any flux. Our flux gives a total H2 mass of\n(6.9 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 109 M\u2299 .\nThe gas surface density in NGC 5218 is given by\n(Shibatsuka et al. 2003):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a3H2\nICO\n2\n=\n5.0\n\u00d7\n10\ncos(i)\n,\nM\u2299 pc\u22122\nJy km s\u22121 arcsec\u22122\nand \u03a3gas = 1.36\u03a3H2 , where i is the galaxy inclination and the factor\n1.36 accounts for elements other than hydrogen (e.g., Allen 1973).\nTo estimate the peak central gas surface density from our 12 CO\n(J = 1\u22120) data we re-made the image cubes applying uniform\nweighting, giving a spatial resolution of 5.\u2032\u2032 48 \u00d7 4.\u2032\u2032 58. These data\ngave a peak central gas surface density of \u223c 2000 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Additional observations of the molecular gas in this galaxy have been\nmade by Olsson et al. (2004) at higher resolution (3.\u2032\u2032 75 \u00d7 3.\u2032\u2032 54)\nusing the OVRO millimetre array. Using these data they observe a\npeak gas surface density of \u223c 3000 M\u2299 pc\u22122 .\nThe intensity weighted mean velocity field of the BIMA 12 CO\n(J = 1\u22120) data is shown in Fig. 6. These data are used later to fit\na rotation curve for NGC 5218. The 12 CO (J = 2\u22121) emission observed with the JCMT is shown in Fig. 7.

The contour levels are (2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30) K km s\u22121 .\n\nvolved the 12 CO (J = 1\u22120) data down to the same resolution as the\nJCMT data (20.\u2032\u2032 8) and re-gridded the datasets to a common grid;\nthe two datasets appeared consistent over their overlap region.\nWe measure the 12 CO (J = 2\u22121)/12 CO (J = 1\u22120) line ratio at\nthe centre of NGC 5218 (RA 13h 32m 10.s 2, Dec +62\u25e6 46\u2032 4.\u2032\u2032 85)\nto be 0.8 \u00b1 0.2. This line ratio is similar to that found in Orion\n(Sakamoto et al. 1994) and is consistent with the presence of giant molecular clouds that have a kinetic temperature, Tk \u223c 20 K\nand density, n(H2 ) > 103 cm\u22123 . This ratio is similar to that observed by Braine & Combes (1992) in the centre of normal spiral galaxies (0.89 \u00b1 0.06). The indication of a normal molecular\ngas environment at the centre of NGC 5218 is corroborated by the\n13 CO (J = 1\u22120)/12 CO (J = 1\u22120) line ratio of 9.0\u00b11.3 (Aalto et al.\n1991), which is comparable to the value observed in our Galaxy\nwhen averaged over the inner 300 pc.\n\nThe 12 CO (J = 1\u22120) data for NGC 5218 give a molecular gas mass\nof (6.9 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 109 M\u2299 (see Section 3.3). The mass of atomic gas\nstill bound to the late-type system is (8.4 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 108 M\u2299 , while\nthe total atomic gas mass associated with the Arp 104 system is\n(2.8 \u00b1 0.2) \u00d7 109 M\u2299 (see Section 3.2).\nAllowing for differences in the H2 -to-CO conversion factor, we compare the molecular-to-atomic gas ratio of NGC 5218\nto galaxies in the literature. Including all the atomic gas associated with the extended tidal features in NGC 5218, we obtain a molecular-to-atomic ratio, in terms of log(MH2 /MHI ) of\n0.40, which is significantly larger than that observed in both normal (\u22120.45 \u00b1 0.07, from (Casoli et al. 1990), and \u22120.15 from\n(Bettoni et al. 2003)) an peculiar SBb systems (\u22120.18 \u00b1 0.15,\n(Casasola, Bettoni & Galletta 2004)). All mean ratios quoted in the\nliterature indicate SBb systems have less molecular gas than atomic\ngas; in contrast, NGC 5218 appears to have at least twice as much\nmolecular than atomic gas.\n\n3.5 The dynamics of the interaction\nThe spatial extent of Arp 104's tidal tails can be used to make an\napproximate estimate the timescale of the interaction. The semicircular tail extending to the north of NGC 5218 is \u223c 6.\u2032 3, which\ncorresponds to a physical distance of \u223c 75 kpc, whereas the tidal\nbridge to the south is \u223c 5\u2032 , or approximately 60 kpc in extent. The\ntwo tidal extensions have comparable lengths, indicative of similar\nformation timescales. If we assume that the atomic gas associated\nwith NGC 5218 was not accelerated during the encounter, then the\nvelocities of the gas will be comparable to those prior to the interaction. The velocity of the atomic gas that has travelled approximately 70 kpc to the tip of the tidal tails can then be estimated\nfrom the rotational velocity of the system and the orbital velocity\nof the galaxy, vgas = (\u2206V )/2 + v, where v is the rotational velocity of the galaxy from which the tidal tail originated and \u2206V is the\nrelative radial velocity of the two interacting galaxies. The interaction between NGC 5218 and NGC 5216 appears to be largely in the\nplane of the sky; the galaxies have very similar systemic velocities\nso we assume a relative radial velocity of zero. We estimate the rotational velocity of NGC 5218 to be \u223c 247 km s\u22121 (corrected for\ninclination). The spatial extent of the tidal tail and the estimated velocity of the gas imply a time since perigalacticon of approximately\n2.8 \u00d7 108 yr.\nAs a further probe of the dynamical evolution of the Arp 104\ninteraction we have modelled the observed H I distribution using\ncollisionless N-body simulations which provide a better constraint\non the dynamics. Our observational data place some immediate\nconstraints on the simulations, including: the absolute masses of\nthe galaxies involved and their mass ratio; the relative velocity difference of the line of sight velocities; the relative orientation of the\ngalaxies; the physical separation of the galaxies and the length and\norientation of the tidal tails.\nDynamical, B-band and K-band mass estimates for NGC 5218\nand 5216, where appropriate, are given in Table 1. For the dynamical mass estimate of NGC 5218 a spherical mass distribution and\ninclination angle of 49.\u25e6 5 (taken from the HyperLeda database2 )\nwere assumed. The B-band mass estimates used a solar absolute\nB-band magnitude of 5.46 and assumed a mass-to-light ratio of 4\n\n2\n\nsee: http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/\n\n\f8\n\nH. Cullen et al.\n\nTable 1.

The K-band mass estimates assume a stellar K-band\nabsolute magnitude of 3.32 and adopt a mass-to-light ratio of 1 : 1\nfor both the early and late-type systems (Bell et al. 2003). Both the\nB-band and K-band estimates are from the total emission magnitudes of the galaxies. Whilst these mass estimates are subject to a\nlarge degree of uncertainty, they nonetheless provide a useful starting point for simulations of this system.\nUsing these constraints a series of N-body simulations were\nrun using an in-house tree code (Clemens et al. 1999). Preliminary,\nrestricted N-body simulations were used to explore the parameter\nspace. Simulations started with zero energy (parabolic) orbits. The\nrestricted N-body simulations allowed exploration of a range of\npossible perigalactic separations. Having established a parameter\nrange within which simulations produced tidal features that were a\ngood representation of those observed, further, self-consistent simulations were run to confirm the validity of the selected parameters.\nThe criteria for the 'best-fit' model was a simulated mass distribution in which the projected separation of the galaxy pair was a good\nmatch to that observed and the morphology and velocity profile of\nthe simulated galaxies most closely matched that of the H I distribution.\nThe self-consistent N-body simulations of galactic systems\nused two types of collisionless particles to simulate the stellar and\ndark matter; we ignore hydrodynamical effects in the formation of\nthe tidal tails. Initial conditions for the simulated late-type galaxies are determined by a technique developed by Hernquist (1993).\nEach late-type galaxy consists of a dark matter halo, a central stellar bulge, and a rotating disk. The particles are then positioned,\nfollowing a spatial density profile modelled on observed profiles.\nThe halo, disk and bulge components were assigned the mass ratio\n1.0 : 1.0 : 0.3, the halo and bulge components we each composed of\n16384 particles, whilst the disk component contained 32768 particles. The early-type system was simulated using the NEMO code\n(Teuben 1995) to construct a Plummer model. In each case the\nmodel galaxies were evolved under gravity to confirm their stability\nprior to use in simulations.\nA series of simulations were run using models for an elliptical\nand spiral galaxy on zero energy (parabolic) or small positive energy (hyperbolic) orbits. A number of mass scalings were explored.\nThese included, adoption of the K-band mass estimates, adoption\nof the K-band mass ratio but using the mass scale defined by the dynamical mass estimate for NGC 5218 and adoption of the dynamical mass estimate for NGC 5218 and the K-band mass estimate for\nNGC 5216. The last of these combinations implied a mass ratio of\nthe late to early-type galaxies of 4 : 1. These simulations produced\nshort tidal tails, unlike those observed in the H I data. On the basis\nof this work we suggest that the mass ratio of the two galaxies is\ncloser to 2 : 1, as implied by the K-band mass ratio.\nAll the simulations run using a 2 : 1 mass ratio for the late to\nearly-type galaxies produced a tidal-tail morphology similar to that\n\nobserved in the H I data. The results obtained appeared relatively\nrobust. Several simulations were run, with an initial disk inclination of 0, 30, 60 and 90 degrees. The best-fit set of parameters\nwere based on a parabolic interaction with a perigalactic separation of 12.5 kpc, using galaxies with a masses approximated using\nthe K-band mass-to-light ratio; the simulated data, for an initial\ndisk inclination of 60 degrees, are shown in Fig. 8. The time from\nperigalacticon to the point at which the simulated data best represented the H I observations was \u223c 50 time-steps, corresponding to\na timescale of \u223c 3.3 \u00d7 108 yr. This is in good agreement with the\ncrude dynamical estimate derived above.\n\n4 ANALYSIS OF THE BAR IN NGC 5218\n4.1 Rotation Curve\nThe first step in the analysis of the bar is to attain a rotation curve\nfor NGC 5218. The rotation curve was established predominately\nusing the VLA H I data. Using the channel maps (Fig. 2), spatial\nand velocity selection were use to isolate gas which is dynamically\nassociated with NGC 5218, this corresponded to gas out to a radius\nof approximately 9 kpc. NGC 5218 contains a bright central radio\ncontinuum source and as a result H I in the nuclear region is seen\nin absorption, making it difficult to fit a rotation curve to the H I\ndata in this region. However, in the central region our 12 CO (J =\n1\u22120) observations provide a reliable estimate of the rotation curve.\nWe therefore use H I data for radii beyond about 2.5 kpc and CO\ndata within this radius. The 12 CO (J = 1\u22120) observations have the\nadditional advantage that they are higher resolution than the H I\ndata, reducing the problems of beam-smearing in the centre of the\ngalaxy (Sofue et al. 1999).\nRotation curves for NGC 5218 were derived from the\nintensity-weighted velocity field of the H I and CO data using\nthe AIPS task GAL. For both the H I and CO datasets we used\nthe highest resolution images, so as to minimise the effect of\nbeam smearing. For the H I data this corresponded to a spatial\nresolution 13.\u2032\u2032 3 \u00d7 10.\u2032\u2032 7, and for the CO data the resolution was\n8.\u2032\u2032 8 \u00d7 5.\u2032\u2032 3. The rotation curves were derived using a tilted-ring\nmodel (Warner et al. 1973). This method approximates the galaxy\nas a set of concentric rings of gas at increasing radii, characterised\nby a circular velocity, position angle and inclination angle. Attempts to derive the rotation curve leaving the dynamic centre and\ninclination angle as free parameters yielded unphysical results. The\ndynamical centre was therefore calculated by performing a global\nrotation curve fit to H I datasets at three different resolutions for\nboth Brandt and Exponential rotation curves independently. The\ndynamical centre was found to be stable across all fits and was\ntherefore fixed for the purposes of the tilted-ring curve fitting. Optical data were used to fix the inclination angle which was taken\nfrom the Hyperleda database3 .\nThe H I rotation curve was fitted by breaking the galaxy into\nannuli 5\u2032\u2032 in width (approximately the half-beam width) and fitting\nthe velocity field in each annulus, keeping the dynamical centre and\ninclination angle fixed. Radii below 10\u2032\u2032 in which the H I is seen\npredominately in absorption were excluded. A similar fit was performed on the molecular gas data, using the same fixed dynamical\ncentre and inclination angle. For these higher resolution data 2.\u2032\u2032 5\nannuli were used, and the data were fit from zero radius outwards.\nIn Fig. 9 we plot the circular velocity v(R), resulting from analysis.\n3\n\nSee http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/\n\n\fH I and CO observations of Arp 104\n\n9\n\nFigure 8.

The J, H and\nKs passbands are less sensitive to extinction by dust in the central regions of the galaxies than shorter wavelengths, and offer a\nbar tracer that is unlikely to be contaminated by recent star formation. We adopt the method of Regan & Elmegreen (1997) \u2013 see also\nMartini et al. (2001); Sheth et al. (2002) and Sheth et al. (2003) for\nexamples of this technique \u2013 to estimate the length of the bar; this\nassumes the bar ends correspond to the point of maximum ellipticity when fitting the galaxy isophotes. The ellipticity of the 2MASS\nimage isophotes, in the plane of the sky, were fit using the IRAF\nSTSDAS task ELLIPSE, which measures the surface brightness, ellipticity and position angle of the semi-major axis. Figure 11 shows\nthe ELLIPSE fitted ellipticities for both the J- and K-band 2MASS\nimages. Both images give very similar results; the J-band image indicates a maximum ellipticity of 0.618 \u00b1 0.008 at a radius of 13.\u2032\u2032 3\nand the K-band image a maximum ellipticity of 0.610 \u00b1 0.008 at a\nradius of 14.\u2032\u2032 0.\nThe bar's de-projected length l can p\nthen be obtained from\nthe observed length lobs using lobs = l cos2 \u03a6 + sin2 \u03a6 cos2 i\n(Arnaboldi et al. 1995), where i is the inclination angle of the\ngalaxy (49.\u25e6 5) and \u03a6 is the angle the bar makes with galaxy's major axis in the plane of the galaxy. To determine \u03a6 we take the\nposition angle of the galaxy to be the average of position angles\nfitted to the H I data using the tilted-ring model in GAL and the\nposition angle of the bar to be that obtained by the IRAF package\nELLIPSE at maximum ellipticity. These angles are 71.\u25e6 4 \u00b1 4.\u25e6 3 and\n81.\u25e6 6 \u00b1 0.\u25e6 3 respectively. Thus, the angle the bar makes with the\nmajor axis in the plane of the sky \u03a6\u2032 = 10\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6 , and \u03a6 follows\nsince tan(\u03a6\u2032 ) = tan(\u03a6) cos(i), thus \u03a6 = 15\u25e6 \u00b1 5\u25e6 . These angles\nyield a very small correction factor in converting between the observed and de-projected bar length: l = 1.02 \u00d7 lobs , giving l = 28.\u2032\u2032 6\nand r = 14.\u2032\u2032 3. Assuming co-rotation is at 1.2 \u00d7 R (Athanassoula\n1992, 1994) yields a co-rotation radius of 17.\u2032\u2032 1 which corresponds\nto a physical radius of 3.4 kpc and gives and estimate of the pattern\nspeed of the bar of 40 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 , which is similar to that seen in\nother SB galaxies (e.g., Merrifield & Kuijken 1995; Gerssen et al.\n1999; Laine et al. 1998) and in our Galaxy (Dehnen 1999). Examining the angular velocity obtained from the rotation curve fitting at\na radius of 3.4 kpc we find the velocity is significantly larger than\nthe peak value of the \u03a9 \u2212 \u03ba /2 curve; this implies there is no inner\nLindblad resonance in NGC 5218. We note that the calculated radius of co-rotation (3.4 kpc) is not dissimilar to the radius obtained\nby measuring distance between the molecular gas peaks toward the\nends of the bar (3.9 kpc).\nConstraints on the existence or not of an inner Lindblad resonance in NGC 5218 depend sensitively on \u03a9(R) and \u03ba (R). As\nsuch they are subject to a large degree of uncertainty. In particular,\nthe absence of an observed peak in the \u03a9 \u2212 \u03ba /2 is symptomatic\nof a mass distribution which is not strongly centrally condensed;\ninner Lindblad resonances only develop if the mass distribution is\nsufficiently centrally peaked. It is well known that low resolution\nobservations smooth out the steep central rise of rotation curves\nwhich results from the core and bulge of the galaxy (Sofue et al.\n1999). It is possible that the limited resolution of our observations\nis making it difficult to detect the steeply rising rotation curve in\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nRadius (kpc)\n\nFigure 11.

Around radii of approximately 3 kpc, where we have both\natomic and molecular gas observations there is a clear deviation\nin the velocity structure of the two components. This is not unexpected. The fall in the angular velocity of the molecular gas around\n3 kpc, in the region of the bar end may be a result of streaming motions within the bar. Gas on the elongated, so-called x1 orbits in the\nbar (Athanassoula 1994), has a rotational velocity at the apex of the\nellipse, near the end of the bar, which is lower than that of gas on a\ncircular orbits at the same radius, therefore its \u03a9(R) will be lower.\nBy comparison, if the H I has a large scale height than the molecular gas, it is likely to have been less influenced by the bar in this\nregion. We have also performed a more detailed comparison of the\nH I and CO dynamics by comparing the H I and 12 CO (J = 1\u22120)\nspectra at four locations across the disk. The spectra were extracted\nfrom data cubes at a common resolution of 17.\u2032\u2032 2 \u00d7 13.\u2032\u2032 5. In the\ncentral region the linewidths and lineshape of the spectra were very\nsimilar. In the more extended regions the molecular gas displays a\nbroader linewidth than the H I. In particular, at the eastern end of\nthe bar, the molecular gas displays a two-peaked profile with the\natomic gas indicating emission in only one of these peaks.\n\n5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n5.1 Enhanced central molecular gas\nIn Section 3.4 we showed that NGC 5218 has a large molecular gas mass for an SBb galaxy. The molecular gas distribution is\nstrongly centrally concentrated with a peak surface density greater\nthan 2000 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (Section 3.3). Numerous numerical simulations predict that bars, whether spontaneously or externally triggered, can induce large scale gas inflow toward the central regions\nof galaxies (e.g., MH96; Noguchi 1988; Barnes & Hernquist 1991).\nTwo recent observational studies have found strong evidence for\nthis process; both Sakamoto et al. (1999a) and Sheth et al. (2005)\nhave demonstrated that barred galaxies have a larger concentration\n\n\fH I and CO observations of Arp 104\nof molecular gas in their central kiloparsec than unbarred systems.\nSakamoto et al. (1999a) used the NRO\u2013OVRO survey of 20 nearby\nspiral galaxies (see Sakamoto et al. 1999b) to show that the degree\nof concentration of molecular gas in the central kiloparsec of barred\nspiral galaxies is greater than in their unbarred counterparts. They\nquantify this effect using the ratio of the molecular gas surface density in the central kiloparsec to that over the entire optical disk\n( fcon ), finding this ratio is on average four times larger in barred\nthan in unbarred systems. Sheth et al. (2005) studied a sample of\n50 nearby spirals \u2013 including both late type barred and unbarred\nspirals, and CO-bright and CO-faint galaxies \u2013 and found the effect\nof the bar equally pronounced in late and early Hubble type spirals. Atomic gas observations also indicate higher gas column densities in barred galaxies. Risaliti, Maiolino & Salvati (1999) examined the atomic gas column density in front of Seyfert nuclei using\nX-ray measurements and found significantly higher column densities in Seyferts with barred hosts than those in the unbarred sample. To estimate fcon for NGC 5218 we remade the channel maps at\nthe highest possible spatial resolution (\u03b8FWHM \u223c 5\u2032\u2032 , \u223c 1 kpc). Although beam smearing introduces uncertainty into our analysis, we\nfind a 12 CO (J = 1\u22120) flux over the central kiloparsec in NGC 5218\nwhich corresponds to a gas mass of \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 . This is equivalent to a molecular hydrogen surface density of \u223c 1300 M\u2299 pc\u22122\nand a gas surface density of \u223c 1800 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . This is approximately six times the mean of the barred sample of Sheth et al.\n(2005) (\u223c 300 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ). In addition, the data for NGC 5218 indicate an fcon value of 113, almost twice the average of the BIMA\nsample (\u223c 60) and slightly larger than the average of the NRO\u2013\nOVRO sample (\u223c 100). The discrepancy between the two literature values can be attributed to the NRO\u2013OVRO sample consisting\nmainly of CO-luminous galaxies. In contrast, the BIMA sample\nwas selected on the basis of B-band magnitude and thus represents,\nat least from the perspective of CO flux comparison, a less biased\nsample. The existence of the bar in NGC 5218 has led to a very\nlarge central molecular gas surface density, even within the context\nof barred galaxies. For comparison we note that typical mean densities of the largest molecular cloud complexes in M31, M33 and\nM51 are in the range 40\u2212500 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , whilst the gas surface density of a typical giant molecular cloud in the outer disk of the Milky\nWay is 200 M\u2299 pc\u22122 (Scoville & Sanders 1987).\nThe impact of the bar potential on the gas distribution in\nNGC 5218 is consistent with the bar's ellipticity, which implies it\nis a strong bar. The ellipticity of a bar is thought to provide a good\nmeasure of the bar strength. Martin (1995) identify strong bars as\nthose with an ellipticity greater than 0.4; the 2MASS K-band data\nfor NGC 5218 give a deprojected ellipticity for NGC 5218 of the\nbar of at least 0.4. Simulations by Regan & Teuben (2004) find that\nweak bars have almost no effect on the radial distribution of the\nISM. In contrast, strong extended bars are likely to be more effective at driving gas toward the centre of the galaxy. Their simulations\nalso indicate that bars are only able to drive gas inwards to a radius\nat which a ring forms; for bars containing inner rings, little net inflow takes place inside this radius. Nuclear rings are likely to form\nwhen so-called x2 orbits exist; such orbits require the presence of\ntwo inner Lindblad resonances. Our very high central gas densities\nare consistent with no inner ring and no inner Lindblad resonances\nas our analysis of the bar dynamics suggests.\n\n11\n\ntor, X \u2261 N(H2 )/ICO = 2.8 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 K km s\u22121 (Bloemen et al.\n1986), which is appropriate for molecular gas clouds in the Milky\nWay (Sanders et al. 1984). In adopting this conversion factor we assume that the conditions of the molecular gas clouds in NGC 5218\nare similar to the molecular gas clouds in the Milky Way. This is\nan assumption, and it is possible that the CO emissivity in this system is enhanced due to high pressures and/or velocity dispersion in\nthe bulge region (Regan et al. 2001). However, the observation of a\n13 CO (J = 1\u22120)/12 CO (J = 1\u22120) line ratio of 9.0\u00b11.3 (Aalto et al.\n1991) in NGC 5218, which is comparable to the value observed in\nthe Milky Way when averaged over 300 pc, lends weight to the\nadoption of the Milky Way conversion factor.\nAlthough the molecular gas distribution in NGC 5218 is centrally concentrated, there is also evidence of more extended emission (see Fig. 5). In particular, the 12 CO (J = 1\u22120) integrated emission indicates two molecular gas condensations slightly offset from\nthe bar ends. The radius of these gas peaks (3.9 kpc) is similar to\nthe calculated radius of co-rotation (3.4 kpc), see Section 4.2. The\npresence of these gas complexes, like that of the large central peak,\ncan be attributed to the existence of a barred potential. Gas concentrations at bar ends have been observed in a number of galaxies\n(e.g., Kenney & Lord 1991; Downes et al. 1996; Sheth et al. 2000,\n2002). These concentrations may be stagnation points in the gas\nflow; gas on x1 orbits at the bar ends will have a smaller angular\nvelocity than more central gas due to its larger radius. Their presence may also be due to the convergence of gas on elliptical orbits\nin the bar with gas on more circular orbits in the region just beyond\nthe bar (Kenney & Lord 1991); these gas complexes are located in\na transition region between the spiral arms and bar ends. Although\nthe bar in NGC 5218 appears to have contributed to a central concentration of gas, this process appears to be ongoing.\nWe now consider the origin of NGC 5218's high molecular\ngas mass. In Section 3.4 we showed that NGC 5218 has a comparatively low H I mass. The bar may have led predominately to the\ntransport of existing molecular material from the disk to the centre\nof NGC 5218, or this transport could have involved both atomic\nand molecular gas with subsequent conversion of atomic to molecular gas in the central region. Davoust & Contini (2004) studied\nthe effects of bars on the neutral hydrogen content of starburst and\nSeyfert galaxies and found that the barred galaxies had a lower total H I mass than unbarred galaxies. They suggest that atomic gas\nis funnelled toward the centre of barred galaxies where it is then\nconverted to molecular gas. In Section 3.2 we used H I absorption\nobservations to estimate the atomic gas column density in the centre\nof NGC 5218 to be (3.0 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . Various studies indicate a 'transition' column density at which H I is sufficiently dense\nfor self-shielding to allow the formation of H2 of \u223c 5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ,\nincreasing to > 1021 cm\u22122 for large molecular clouds (Savage et al.\n1977; Federman, Glassgold & Kwan 1979; Franco & Cox 1986;\nReach, Koo & Heiles 1994). The H I column density observed at\nthe centre of NGC 5218 lies above these values so H I to H2 conversion may be taking place at the centre of NGC 5218. The high\nH2 to H I ratio in the centre of NGC 5218 and the dynamical consistency of the two components in the central region (see Section 4.3)\nis certainly consistent with inflow of both components and efficient\nH I to H2 conversion.\n5.3 Star formation\n\n5.2 CO-to-H2 conversion factor\nThe molecular gas mass in NGC 5218 and the resulting gas column densities are calculated using the CO-to-H2 conversion fac-\n\nIn Section 3.1 we estimated the SFR of NGC 5218 using both radio\nand FIR data; these data yield SFRs of 3.4 and 5.3 M\u2299 yr\u22121 respectively. A large proportion of the star formation is taking place\n\n\f12\n\nH. Cullen et al.\n\nin the dusty central region of NGC 5218 (see below) where we observe a very large molecular gas density. However, both the radio\nand FIR provide largely extinction-free probes of the star formation\nand as such should yield robust estimates of the SFR. Comparison\nof the NVSS (\u03b8FWHM = 45\u2032\u2032 ) flux density (30.4 \u00b1 1.0 mJy) and the\nFIRST (Becker, White & Helfand 1994) (\u03b8FWHM = 5.\u2032\u2032 4) flux density (23.06 \u00b1 0.14 mJy) suggests at least 75% of the galaxy's star\nformation is coming from the central kiloparsec region.\nBefore discussing the star-formation properties of NGC 5218\nwe note a potential caveat with the estimation of the SFR of this\nsystem. A number of authors have examined the optical spectroscopy of NGC 5218 for AGN activity. On the basis of their investigation Ashby, Houck & Matthews (1995) conclude the emission line properties of NGC 5218 are ambiguous, and Veilleux et al.\n(1995) classify it as a LINER. NGC 5218 sits comfortably on the\nradio-FIR correlation (Yun, Reddy & Condon 2001) with no obvious radio or FIR excess; the two SFR estimators yield very similar results (Section 3.1). In addition, recent work by Dudik et al.\n(2005) suggests that in their sample of IR-bright LINERS the low\nX-ray luminosities and Eddington ratios imply the contribution\nfrom the AGN to the FIR luminosity is likely to be small. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that nuclear activity in this\nsystem leads to an overestimated FIR SFR.\n5.3.1 Is the level of star formation large?\nNGC 5218 appears to have a substantial star formation rate.\nThe 60-\u03bc m luminosity of NGC 5218, 1.5 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299 , is more\nthan three times the median for Sb\u2013Sbc galaxies found by\nDevereux & Hameed (1997), although it does not qualify it as Luminous Infrared Galaxy (LIRG). NGC 5218's H-band normalised\nSFR, an approximation of star formation per unit mass, implies\na slightly enhanced value (Devereux & Hameed 1997). The mean\nvalue of log(LFIR /LB ) obtained by Devereux & Hameed (1997)\nfor Sb\u2013Sbc galaxies was \u22120.48 \u00b1 0.34, whereas the value for\nNGC 5218 is \u22120.05, consistent with a high current SFR in relation\nto its recent star formation history (although it may also reflect, to\nsome extent, increased gas and therefore dust in its centre).\nThe star-formation efficiency (SFE) is the ratio of the current\nstar-formation rate to the mass of molecular gas: for NGC 5218 the\nSFE derived from the FIR star formation rate and total molecular\ngas mass is \u223c 8 \u00d7 10\u221210 yr\u22121 . This value, whilst larger than the\naverage for Sb galaxies (Murgia et al. 2002), is still significantly\nbelow the \u223c 30% over 108 yr found in starburst systems (Kennicutt\n1998). Despite NGC 5218's relatively high star-formation rate, its\nglobal star-formation efficiency appears to be more in keeping with\nthat of a normal Sb galaxy than a starburst system. The star formation efficiency of the central 2\u22123 kpc is approximately three times\nthe global value, falling toward the lower end of those systems classified as nuclear starbursts Planesas, Colina & Perez-Olea (1997)\nSakamoto et al. (1999a) have investigated the gas-todynamical mass ratio in the central kiloparsec of a sample of 20\nnearby spiral galaxies. They observe a larger ratio in galaxies with\nan H II spectral classification, and interpret this as evidence for\nmore active star formation and nuclear spectra dominated by H II\nregions in galaxies which have large amounts of gas given their\nsize. They suggest that the effect may be related to the stability of\nthe nuclear molecular gas disk, relating Mgas /Mdyn to the Toomre\nQ parameter (Toomre 1964). For comparison with these data we\nuse the highest resolution CO data set for NGC 5218 to examine\nthe gas-to-dynamical mass ratio in central kiloparsec. We integrate\nthe flux obtained in the central molecular gas peak and compare\n\nthe mass obtained with an estimate of the dynamical mass in this\nregion. We select a physical region with a radius of r \u223c 1 kpc,\nlarger than the region (r = 500 pc) examined by Sakamoto et al.\n(1999a) because we can make a more robust estimate of Mgas /Mdyn\non this scale given our available data. The region examined lies\nwell within the physical extent of the bar; the molecular gas\ndynamics in this region are dominated by circular motion (Fig. 6).\nAssuming Keplerian rotation and a spherical mass distribution, the\ndynamical mass is\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0010\n\u0013\n\u0012\nMdyn\nv \u00112\nr\n= 2.3 \u00d7 105\n,\nM\u2299\nkpc\nkm s\u22121\nwhere v is the rotational velocity in the plane of the disk at a radius\nr. The 20% linewidth over the 1.1 kpc radius region is 280 km s\u22121 .\nCorrecting for the inclination of the galaxy yields a rotational velocity in the plane of the disk of 184 km s\u22121 , corresponding to a\ndynamical mass of 8.5 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 . Integrating the CO flux observed\nover this area yields a molecular hydrogen mass of 1.6 \u00d7 109 M\u2299\nand a molecular gas mass of 2.2\u00d7109 M\u2299 . The molecular gas mass\nfraction over the central 1.1 kpc radius region in NGC 5218 is 26%,\n1\u03c3 above the value obtained by Sakamoto et al. (1999a) for H II\ndominated systems (17.6 \u00b1 8.0% over the central kiloparsec). If we\nreduce the physical scale over which we undertake the comparison,\nthe mass fraction increases dramatically. Our data imply that the\ngas-to-dynamical mass ratio over the central region of NGC 5218\nis large when compared with actively star forming H II systems in\nthe Sakamoto et al. sample.\nWe note that the derived Mgas /Mdyn is only related to the\nToomre Q parameter and the central gas stability if the gas is in\nthe form of a nuclear disk. Bar-streaming motions introduce inherent uncertainty into the use of the ratio Mgas /Mdyn as a probe\nof the stability. In addition, many theorists are sceptical about using the Toomre Q parameter as a measure of instability toward star\nformation, arguing that feedback from such star formation would\nlower the parameter on short timescales (e.g., Combes 2001, see\nalso Koda et al. 2005). Nonetheless, the results of Sakamoto et al.\n(1999a) indicate that all except one of the H II galaxies in their sample have an Mgas /Mdyn greater than 0.1 and we believe comparison\nwith these observations is useful.\n5.4 Bar formation in NGC 5218\nBoth simulation-based and observational evidence exists linking\ntidal perturbations with the triggering of bars. In particular, observations in the literature point to bars in early-type galaxies, of\nwhich NGC 5218 is an example, being produced in this way. This\nresult is supported by simulations which indicate that a bulge component acts to stabilise the galaxy against spontaneous bar formation, an increasingly massive bulge offering increased stability\n(MH96). It may be that for galaxies with bulges an external trigger is a prerequisite for a bar to form. To investigate any link between the bar in NGC 5218 and its tidal interaction, we look in\nmore detail at the nature of the bar, undertaking comparisons with\nboth simulation-based and observational data.\nSimulations suggest that interactions can affect bar formation\nin galaxies in a number of different ways: they can trigger bar formation in an otherwise stable galaxy; speed up the process of bar\nformation in a system which is already unstable (Gerin et al. 1990);\nregenerate a dissolved or weakened bar (Berentzen et al. 2004) and\nenhance or decrease the strength of an existing bar (Gerin et al.\n1990). All such scenarios are possible in NGC 5218, although the\nstrength of the bar, as measured from the axial ratio, would imply\n\n\fH I and CO observations of Arp 104\nthat the tidal encounter is unlikely to have significantly weakened\nthe bar.\nIn an investigation of the blue and near-infrared surface photometry of 15 barred spirals, Elmegreen & Elmegreen (1985) observed two different types of major axis surface density profiles,\nexponential and flat. On the basis of their simulations, Noguchi\n(1996) argue that exponential profiles are found in spontaneously\nproduced bars, whilst flatter profiles occur in bars produced by\ntidal instability. Unfortunately the photometric data available for\nNGC 5218 are not of sufficiently high resolution to confidently\ndiscern between the two profiles; the large central peak observed\nin all bars yields a profile that appears exponential when smoothed\nto lower resolution. Nonetheless, the SDSS z-band light profile indicates some flattening and a flattened profile is certainly possible.\nIn Noguchi's interpretation, this implies the bar profile is consistent with a bar produced by tidal perturbation. Recent work by\nBerentzen et al. (2004) has questioned this interpretation, arguing\nthat the results of Athanassoula & Misiriotis (2002) indicate that\nboth profiles occur in isolated systems and that the different profiles\nare associated with varying bar strengths rather than the triggering\nmechanism, flatter profiles being produced in stronger bars.\nOur analysis of NGC 5218 gave an estimated pattern speed for\nthe bar of \u223c 40 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 . Studies by Miwa & Noguchi (1998)\nshow that in weak tidal perturbations the properties of the bar depend largely on the internal structure of the host galaxy, rather\nthan the speed of the perturber (see also simulations by Gerin et al.\n1990). However, for stronger tidal perturbations the pattern speed\nis dependent on the perturber mass (see also Berentzen et al. 2004).\nMiwa & Noguchi argue that for the strongest perturbations tidally\ninduced bars can rotate slowly with an inner Lindblad resonance\nnear the bar ends, whereas bars produced by weaker perturbations have no inner-Lindblad resonances, rotate more rapidly, and\nend near co-rotation. In the case of NGC 5218 we inferred that\nthere are no inner-Lindblad resonances, and that if the bar-ends are\nco-rotating its angular velocity is \u223c 40 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 . However,\nsince the \u03a9 \u2212 \u03ba /2 curve provides a relatively constant resonance\nthroughout the galactic radii at a velocity of 10 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 , we\ncannot exclude the possibility that the bar in NGC 5218 is rotating\nat this, much slower velocity, and ending before co-rotation.\nA number of investigations of tidal triggering of bar formation have looked at the relationship between strength of interaction\nand bar formation (Miwa & Noguchi 1998; Berentzen et al. 2004).\nQuantitative comparison between these simulations and our results\nis difficult since many of the results are sensitive to the mass concentration of the disk and the disk-to-halo mass fraction which are\ndifficult to constrain observationally. Nonetheless, we can make\nsome important observations about this system. Given the apparently low mass ratio of NGC 5216 to NGC 5218 (1 : 2 using K-band\ndata, Section 3.5), the perigalactic separation required to produce\na tidal perturbation of sufficient strength to induce bar formation is\nlikely to be small. The necessity of a small perigalactic separation\nis consistent with the simulations, which indicate that production of\nthe extended tidal features observed in the H I distribution require\na small perigalactic separation.\nThe gas surface density in the central kiloparsec of NGC 5218\n(1300 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ) is significantly larger than the mean of both the\nunbarred (107 \u00b1 29 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ) and barred sample (309 \u00b1 71 M\u2299\npc\u22122 ) of Sheth (2001). The enhanced surface density observed in\nNGC 5218 can be accounted for by an additional molecular gas\nmass of the order of 9 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . Estimates of gas inflow rates\nin barred galaxies vary widely (0.1\u221217 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , Friedli & Benz\n1993; Quillen et al. 1995; Laine et al. 1998; Regan et al. 1997;\n\n13\n\nSakamoto et al. 1999a; Iono et al. 2004); adopting the value inferred by Quillen et al. (1995) of 4 \u00b1 2 M\u2299 yr\u22121 via calculation\nof the torques on the molecular gas using near-IR images, we find\nthe time taken to produce the observed enhanced central gas density\nin NGC 5218 is similar to the time since perigalacticon. However,\nit must be remembered the inflow rate is not certain, and may vary\nwith time.\n\n5.5 Conclusions\nNGC 5218 is a barred interacting spiral galaxy which has undergone a prograde encounter with an elliptical, NGC 5216, sometime\nin the recent past. Both the H I velocity field and the simulations indicate the timescale since perigalacticon is of the order of 3 \u00d7 108\nyr. NGC 5218 has a very large central molecular gas surface density\nwhen compared to the molecular gas surface density in the central\nkiloparsec of the BIMA sample of unbarred galaxies (Sheth 2001).\nThe difference can be accounted for if we assume gas inflow to the\ncentral region over the time since perigalacticon and at a rate comparable to those inferred in other systems (e.g., Quillen et al. 1995).\nOur observations are consistent with the interaction of NGC 5218\nwith NGC 5216 triggering an instability in the galactic potential or\nenhancing an existing instability that has led to gas inflow yielding\na central molecular gas density at the elevated level observed.\nThe nature of the bar, molecular gas and dynamical time scales\nwe infer for NGC 5218 are very similar to those in UGC 2855, as\ndiscussed by H\u00fcttemeister, Aalto & Wall (1999). This interacting\ngalaxy also has a high central gas concentration with no evidence\nfor any inner Lindblad resonance or shocking of the molecular gas.\nH\u00fcttemeister et al. deduce that the bar is very young and the system\nis in a pre-starburst phase.\nNGC 5218 has a relatively large SFR (Section 5.3) It has a normal disk-wide star-formation efficiency although the nuclear region\nhas a star-formation efficiency toward the lower end of starburst nuclei. It is possible that NGC 5218 is in the early stages of bar-driven\nevolution and has not yet reached its period of most active star formation. Whilst the bar in NGC 5218 appears to have contributed to\nlarge central molecular gas density there is still a significant fraction of the molecular material found in the more extended regions\nof this system. The process of gas transfer toward the central region of NGC 5218 is clearly ongoing. The molecular gas density in\nthe centre of NGC 5218 may not yet be sufficiently large to have\ntriggered a starburst phase. We suggest that NGC 5218 is likely\nto undergo a period of more enhanced star formation in the near\nfuture. This proposition is supported by the following evidence.\n\u2022 The large concentration of molecular gas and very high surface density in the central region of NGC 5218.\n\u2022 A sizable, extended molecular gas component which indicates\nthat the process of gas transfer to the central region is ongoing.\n\u2022 NGC 5218's large FIR-luminosity and SFR when compared\nwith other galaxies of the same Hubble type.\n\u2022 The large LIR /LB ratio, indicating that the current-to-recent\nstar formation in NGC 5218 is larger than an average early-type\nspiral.\n\u2022 The large Mgas /Mdyn ratio in the centre of NGC 5218 implying a large quantity of gas in this region given its size. This may be\nindicative of instability toward star formation.\n\n\f14\n\nH.
