Introduction\nThe perturbative expansion is a powerful tool in the analysis of scattering amplitudes for\nelementary fields (leptons, quarks and gauge bosons). Bound states (atoms and hadrons)\nappear as poles in scattering amplitudes which arise from the divergence of the perturbation\nseries. The study of bound states and their interactions thus requires summing an infinite\nset of Feynman diagrams. This may be done in the Bethe-Salpeter framework [1]. However,\nthe choice of diagrams to be included in a first approximation, as well as the systematic\nordering of the inclusion of the remaining contributions, allows a wide range of approaches,\nparticularly for relativistic bound states.\nHere I shall argue that an ~ (or equivalently, loop) expansion may serve as a guiding\nprinciple in bound state calculations. In the ~ \u2192 0 limit the phase exp(iS/~) in the path\nintegral oscillates rapidly, causing the (bosonic) fields to approach their classical values,\ncorresponding to a stationary action S. In the absence of field fluctuations there are no\nloop integrals \u2013 thus the Feynman diagrams of lowest order in ~ are Born terms. Since\neach loop brings a factor ~g 2 the perturbative and loop expansions are equivalent for a\ngiven Green function1 . Bound state wave functions on the other hand contain all powers\nof g, yet may have no loop contributions, thus decoupling the ~ and g expansions. This\nis illustrated by the way in which the Schr\u00f6dinger and Dirac equations emerge from QED\nperturbation theory.\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation for non-relativistic (NR) atoms like muonium (e\u2212 \u03bc+ ) is\ngenerated by the sum of ladder diagrams shown in Fig. 1. The factor \u03b1 = e2 /4\u03c0 suppression\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+ ...\n\nFigure 1: Sum of ladder diagrams in e\u2212 \u03bc+ scattering which generate a non-relativistic bound\nstate pole.\n\nof each photon exchange is compensated when the propagators in the corresponding loop\nintegral are nearly on-shell, which brings an inverse factor of the relative velocity v between\nthe fermions. Thus for v \u223c \u03b1 all diagrams are effectively of the same order, causing the\nseries to diverge regardless of how small \u03b1 is. Due to the NR motion Coulomb photon\nexchange dominates and transfers only 3-momentum. Energy transfer is suppressed by\n\u03b1, quenching the loop integrals in Fig. 1 at leading order. Hence the dynamics reduces\nto scattering from a fixed \u03b1/r Coulomb potential and is described by the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation. The repeated scattering from the potential brings powers of \u03b1 without loops.\nThe Dirac equation for a relativistic electron may be derived in a similar way [3], by\nincluding all crossed photon exchanges as indicated in Fig. 2. In the limit of a large muon\nmass the full sum of crossed and uncrossed photon exchange diagrams reduces at each\norder in \u03b1 to the scattering of the electron in a fixed \u03b1/r Coulomb potential described by\n1\n\nThe equivalence between the number of loops and powers of ~ is actually non-trivial, see [2].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+ ...\n\nFigure 2: Sum of all uncrossed and crossed photon exchange diagrams which generate Dirac bound\nstates in the limit where one of the fermion masses is large.\n\nthe Dirac equation2 . Hence the leading contribution of the sum of multiloop diagrams in\nFig. 2 to the bound state poles arises from classical Coulomb scattering and in this sense\nis of lowest order in ~.\nThe symmetries of the lagrangian are preserved at each order in ~. Thus boost invariance requires\nthat the bound state energy E must be related to its CM momentum k as\np\n2\nE = M + k2 . Wave functions defined at equal time in different frames must also be\nrelated, but that relation is dynamical since the concept of equal time is frame dependent.\nI find an example of this in the present approach.\nScattering amplitudes at the Born level are insensitive to the i\u03b5 prescription of the\npropagators. The relative magnitudes of the time-ordered contributions to these amplitudes\non the other hand do depend on the prescription. Bound states evaluated at lowest order\nin ~ are analogous to Born terms. I show that the energies of Dirac bound states indeed\nare independent of the i\u03b5 prescription, whereas the equal-time wave functions do depend\non the prescription. The standard single-electron Dirac wave function corresponds to using\na retarded electron propagator, which only allows forward propagation in time. The use\nof a Feynman propagator would give Fock states having arbitrarily many electron-positron\npairs, arising from backward propagation of the electron in time (Z-graphs). The use of\nretarded propagators thus essentially simplifies bound state analyses at lowest order in ~.\nGauge theory lagrangians have no time derivative of A0 (unless this is introduced via\nthe gauge fixing). In the ~ \u2192 0 limit A0 is determined at each instant of time by the\npositions of the charged constituents. This implies that Fock states with constituents at\ndifferent positions have distinct A0 fields. The field equations allow a linear A0 potential as\na homogeneous (non-perturbative) solution. For the action to be stationary the orientation\nof the potential needs to be correlated with the locations of the charges in each Fock\ncomponent. Consequently a linear potential is allowed in a self-consistent semi-classical\ntreatment, maintaining Poincar\u00e9 invariance.\nIn the next section I outline the main results, which are then discussed in more detail\nin the following sections.\n\n2. Outline\n2.1 QED atoms and the linear potential option\nI use a hamiltonian approach to field theory bound states in the semi-classical limit, i.e.,\nat lowest order in ~ (no loops). I first illustrate the procedure for ordinary QED atoms\n2\n\nIn a Bethe-Salpeter approach the crossed photon exchanges require kernels of unlimited orders in \u03b1.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\f(muonium, e\u2212 \u03bc+ ) in their rest frame, whose binding is known to be dominated by the\nA0 Coulomb potential. This example reminds us that the instantaneous A0 potential\ndetermined by the equations of motion is different for each Fock state component. It also\nclarifies the distinction between the A0 field for a given Fock state and the A0 field that\nwould be measured by an external probe, the latter being given by a superposition of all\ncontributing Fock states.\nThe determination of A0 from the QED field equation for the Fock component where\nthe electron is located at x1 and the muon at x2 ,\n\u2212\u22072x A0 (x; x1 , x2 ) = e\u03b4 3 (x \u2212 x1 ) \u2212 e\u03b4 3 (x \u2212 x2 )\n\n(2.1)\n\nis unique only up to a homogenous solution. In particular, a contribution linear in x may\nbe added,\n\u0012\n\u0013\ne\n1\n1\nA0 (x; x1 , x2 ) = \u039b2 \u02c6` * x +\n(2.2)\n\u2261 A0lin + A0coul\n\u2212\n4\u03c0 |x \u2212 x1 | |x \u2212 x2 |\nwhere the magnitude \u039b and the direction \u02c6` of the linear term are free parameters. The\ngauge field (2.2) gives an instantaneous contribution to the action,\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n1 4\ne2\n1\n1\n3\n\u03bc\u03bd\n3\n0 2\nd3 x + e\u039b2 \u02c6` * (x1 \u2212 x2 ) \u2212\nd xF\u03bc\u03bd F =\nd x (\u2207A ) = \u039b\n\u2212\n4\n2\n2\n3\n4\u03c0 |x1 \u2212 x2 |\n(2.3)\nHere I suppressed the infinite self-energy contribution of the Coulomb potential, which is\nindependent of x1 and x2 and thus irrelevant for bound state evolution. The first term in\n(2.3) is likewise infinite and irrelevant provided \u039b is a universal constant, \u039b 6= \u039b(x1 , x2 ).\nThe interference term between the linear and Coulomb contributions is finite and may be\nevaluated by taking the integration region to be a sphere whose radius R tends to infinity.\nUsing \u22072 A0lin = 0 and Stokes' theorem,\nZ\nZ\n1\n3\n0\n0\nd x \u2207 * [(\u2207Alin )Acoul ] = lim\ndS * (\u2207A0lin )A0coul = e\u039b2 \u02c6` * (x1 \u2212 x2 ) (2.4)\nR\u2192\u221e |x|=R\n3\n\u0001\nwhere terms of O 1/R3 in the Coulomb potential could be neglected,\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n1 h\nx * xi i\n1\n=\n1+\n+O\n(2.5)\n2\n|x \u2212 xi | |x|=R R\nR\nR3\n|x|=R\nStationarity of the action (2.3) wrt. variations in the direction of the linear potential\nrequires \u02c6` to be parallel to x1 \u2212 x2 . Choosing the sign to give an attractive (rather than\nrepulsive) potential leads to\n\u0012\n\u0013\nx1 \u2212 x2\ne\n1\n1\nA0 (x; x1 , x2 ) = \u039b2\n*x+\n\u2212\n(2.6)\n|x1 \u2212 x2 |\n4\u03c0 |x \u2212 x1 | |x \u2212 x2 |\nwith \u039b a universal constant. The linear potential allows to incorporate non-perturbative\nfeatures of the theory at the semi-classical level. The fermion interaction with the A0 field\ngives\n\u0002\n\u0003\ne2\n1\ne A0 (x1 ; x1 , x2 ) \u2212 A0 (x2 ; x1 , x2 ) = e\u039b2 |x1 \u2212 x2 | \u2212 2\n(2.7)\n4\u03c0 |x1 \u2212 x2 |\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fwhere I again omitted the infinite, x1 - and x2 -independent Coulomb self-interactions.\nThe Coulomb potential is counted twice since both the electron and the muon interact. However, according to (2.3) the phase originating from the gauge part of the action\nR R\nexp(\u2212 4i dt d3 xF\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd ), which describes the energy stored in the Coulomb field, reduces\nthe Coulomb potential to its physical value, VC = \u2212\u03b1/r.\nThe experimental fact that QED does not confine electric charge compels us to choose\n\u039bQED = 0 and thus recover the standard description of muonium bound only by the\nCoulomb potential. In Sections 5 and 6 I find corresponding linear potential solutions of\nthe QCD equations of motion for baryons and mesons. Choosing \u039bQCD 6= 0 amounts to a\nnovel boundary condition for perturbation theory, motivated by the confinement of color\nin QCD.\nA linear potential extending to infinity would be unacceptable on physical grounds.\nHowever, A0 (x; x1 , x2 ) of (2.6) is the field of only a single Fock state. The field that\nwould be measured by an external probe is a superposition of the contributions from all\nFock components. As seen from (2.6), Fock components with opposite separations x1 \u2212 x2\ngive opposite contributions to A0 which cancel if the corresponding Fock probabilities are\nthe same. Hence the electric field vanishes outside the bound state, where all Fock states\ncontribute coherently.\nThe linear potential contributes at O (e) since \u039b is non-perturbative, see (2.7). Hence\nin a perturbative sense it dominates the single (Coulomb and transverse) photon exchanges\n\u0001\nwhich are of O e2 . This allows the analog of a \"Born term\" for gauge theory bound states,\nwhich is exact at lowest order in ~ (no loops) and at first order in the coupling. Lorentz\ninvariance must then be preserved.\np In particular, the bound state energy E should have\nthe correct dependence, E = M 2 + k2 , on the CM momentum k. The bound state\nequation that we derive here for wave functions at equal time in all frames in fact has this\nnon-trivial and unique property. By contrast, in QED atoms the A0 Coulomb potential\ndominates transverse photon exchange only in the rest frame. The boosted muonium atom\n\u0001\ngets a leading O e2 contribution from |e\u03bc\u03b3i Fock states with a transverse photon which\nmust be included to get the correct k dependence [4].\n2.2 Dirac equation in QED \u2013 retarded boundary conditions\nParticle production can no longer be neglected when the dynamics is relativistic. An |e\u03bci\nstate at t = 0 will thus with time develop into states with additional electron and muon\npairs if the interaction potential A0 is commensurate with the particle masses. Relativistic\nbound states (defined at equal time of the constituents) therefore have Fock states with\narbitrarily many particles.\nThe Dirac wave function \u03c8(x) of an electron bound in an external potential is relativistic yet describes the spatial distribution of a single (positive or negative energy) electron.\nUnderstanding the apparent absence of multi-particle Fock states in the Dirac wave function turns out to be useful for formulating a relativistic hamiltonian description of e\u2212 \u03bc+\natoms and hadrons.\nThe Green function G(p0 , p) of an electron in a static (time-independent) A0 potential\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\f(Fig. 3) satisfies\nG(p0 , p) = S + SKG\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere S is the electron propagator and K the kernel for a single A0 interaction. The p0\n\nG(p0,p) =\n\nS\n\np0,0 p0, p\n+\n\np\n\n+\n\nS K\n\nK S\n\nk1\n\nk2\n\n+\n\n+ ...\n\nFigure 3: Electron scattering from a static external potential. The energy p0 of the electron does\nnot change during the scattering. The initial and final electron momenta are denoted (p0 , 0) and\np = (p0 , p).\n\ncomponent of the electron's 4-momentum is conserved during the scattering since the static\nsource only transfers 3-momentum. I take the initial and final 3-momenta of the electron\nto be 0 and p, respectively.\nThe Green function has poles at the bound state energies ER ,\nG(p0 , p) =\n\nR(ER , p)\n+ ...\np0 \u2212 ER\n\nThe pole residue R(ER , p) satisfies R = SKR, or explicitly (with p0 = ER )\nZ\nd3 k\ni\nR(ER , p) =\n(\u2212ie)\u03b3 0 A0 (k) R(ER , p \u2212 k)\np\n(2\u03c0)3\n/ \u2212 m + i\u03b5\n\n(2.9)\n\n(2.10)\n\nMultiplying by p\n/ \u2212 m and Fourier transforming to (p0 , x)-space we find that the residue R\nsatisfies the Dirac equation,\nh\ni\n\u2212 i\u2207 * \u03b3 + e\u03b3 0 A0 (x) + m R(ER , x) = ER \u03b3 0 R(ER , x)\n(2.11)\nIn order to display the equal-time Fock states of the bound state given by the Dirac\n\u0001\nequation we need to time-order the interactions. At O e2 the first (second) diagram on the\nrhs. of Fig.\nq 4 corresponds to the intermediate electron having positive (negative) energy,\n\nEi = \u00b1 k2i + m2e . According to the Feynman i\u03b5 prescription this electron propagates\nforward (backward) in time, corresponding to an intermediate |e\u2212 i (|e\u2212 e+ e\u2212 i) Fock state.\nAt higher orders in e further time orderings contribute. Consequently the bound state has\nFock components with arbitrarily many e+ e\u2212 pairs. The creation and destruction of the\nvarious Fock components balance to create a bound state which is stationary in time.\nThe Dirac wave function \u03c8(x) describes only a single electron, not the details of the\nmultiparticle bound state dynamics. As seen above, the bound state energies p0 = ER\ngiven by the poles of the Green function (2.9) nevertheless are eigenvalues of the (time\nindependent) Dirac equation (2.11) satisfied by the pole residues R(ER , x). This single\nparticle Dirac wave function may be given the following hamiltonian interpretation.\nThe static potential conserves the energy component p0 > 0 of the electron momentum.\nHence the covariant Feynman diagrams in Fig. 3 which build the Green function G(p0 , p)\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fp\n\n0\n\nk1\n\np , ki\n0\n\np0\nk2\n\np0\n=\n\nEi > 0\nt1 t2 p0\n\nk1\n\nk2\n\n+\n\nE\nt1\n\nEi < 0\n\nt2\nE\n\nk2\n\nk1\n\n\u0001\nFigure 4: Electron scattering from a static A0 potential at O e2 . The covariant (p0 -conserving)\ndiagram on the lhs. splits under time-ordering into theqtwo diagrams on the rhs. The interme-\n\ndiate electron has 3-momentum ki and energy Ei = \u00b1 k2i + m2e . The negative energy electron\npropagates backward in time, implying the creation (annihilation) of an e+ e\u2212 pair at t1 (t2 ).\n\ndo not depend on the\nq Feynman i\u03b5 prescription at the negative energy pole of the electron\n0\npropagator, p = \u2212 k2i + m2e +i\u03b5. In particular, the bound state energies ER of the Green\nfunction (2.9) will not change if instead of the Feynman propagator of the electron we use\nthe retarded one,\np\n/ + me\n(2.12)\nSR (p0 , p) = i 0\n(p \u2212 Ep + i\u03b5)(p0 + Ep + i\u03b5)\np\nwhere Ep = p2 + m2e . However, this changes the time development of the scattering so\nthat the electron always propagates forward in time,\nSR (t, p) =\n\n\u0003\n\u03b8(t) \u0002\n(Ep \u03b3 0 \u2212 p * \u03b3 + me )e\u2212iEp t + (Ep \u03b3 0 + p * \u03b3 \u2212 me )eiEp t\n2Ep\n\n(2.13)\n\nConsequently the second (Z-)diagram on the rhs. of Fig. 4 is absent, while the first diagram refers to the (positive or negative energy) electron moving forward in time. There is\nonly a single electron Fock state and the Dirac wave function describes the distribution of\nthis electron. This single particle picture of the time development obtained using retarded\nboundary conditions does not correspond to the physical Fock state structure. Furthermore, the argument that the bound state energies (ER in (2.9)) are independent of the\nboundary condition only holds in the absence of loops, i.e., in the ~ \u2192 0 limit3 .\nIn the absence of backward propagation the electron becomes localized in space as the\npropagation time vanishes,\nlim SR (t, x) = \u03b3 0 \u03b4 3 (x)\n\nt\u21920+\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhich makes a hamiltonian approach feasible. In the operator formalism the retarded\nboundary condition can be implemented using the \"retarded vacuum\",\n|0iR = N \u22121\n\nY\n\nd\u2020p,\u03bb |0i\n\np,\u03bb\n3\n\nLoops with retarded propagators vanish since all poles are on the same side of the energy axis.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n(2.15)\n\n\fwhere the product is over all momenta p and helicities \u03bb. The (infinite) normalization\nfactor N is fixed by R h0|0iR = 1. The retarded vacuum satisfies\nbp,\u03bb |0iR = d\u2020p,\u03bb |0iR = 0\n\nand hence \u03c8(x)|0iR = 0\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere \u03c8(x) is the free (interaction picture) fermion field. Consequently the retarded propagator (2.13) is given by the standard operator matrix element in the retarded vacuum,\nSR (x \u2212 y) = R h0| T [\u03c8(x)\u03c8\u0304(y)] |0iR\n\n(2.17)\n\nThe negative energy contribution to the propagator arises from the d\u2020 d term, which represents the removal of a positive energy antifermion from |0iR . The interaction hamiltonian\nannihilates the retarded vacuum,\nZ\nHI (t)|0iR = e d3 x A0 (x) \u03c8 \u2020 (t, x)\u03c8(t, x)|0iR = 0\n(2.18)\nwhich ensures the absence of particle production. In Section 4 I derive the Dirac equation\nusing this hamiltonian approach.\n2.3 Relativistic QCD bound states\nThe instantaneity of the A0 potential is a consequence of the absence of a \u22020 A0 term in\nthe lagrangian. The dominance of A0 over the transverse A gauge field components in a\nperturbative expansion holds for non-relativistic motion (atoms in their rest frame) and\nmore generally with a non-perturbative linear A0 potential as in (2.7). At lowest order\nin ~ the use of the retarded vacuum (2.15) as boundary condition maintains bound state\nenergies while allowing a valence wave function, as discussed above for the Dirac equation.\nIn Section 5 I find a QCD meson solution using a hamiltonian approach in the retarded\nvacuum. In a specific gauge the linear potential (2.6) is present only in the commuting\ngauge fields (A03 and A08 ) of SU3 . The equation is expected to be exact at leading orders in\n~ and the coupling g, giving the equivalent of a Born term for bound states. The qq\u0304 color\nsinglet wave function \u03c7\u03b1\u03b2\nk (x), where k is the CM momentum of the bound state, \u03b1 and \u03b2\nare Dirac indices and x is the spatial separation of the quark pair at an instant of time,\nsatisfies the bound state equation\n\u2212i\u2207 * [\u03b1, \u03c7k (x)] + 12 k * {\u03b1, \u03c7k (x)} + m1 \u03b3 0 \u03c7k (x) \u2212 \u03c7k (x)\u03b3 0 m2 = (E \u2212 V )\u03c7k (x) (2.19)\nHere m1 (m2 ) is the mass of the q (q\u0304) constituent, \u03b1 = \u03b3 0 \u03b3 is a standard Dirac matrix and\nV (x) = g\u039b2 |x| is the linear potential. This equation is similar in form to the one proposed\nby Breit [5] already in 1929. Here the potential is purely linear since the derivation is valid\nonly at leading order in the gauge coupling g. The properties of this equation (with k = 0\nand m1 = m2 ) was studied phenomenologically [6] for a linear + Coulomb potential (see\nalso [7] and references therein). It was also derived using a stationary phase approximation\nwith retarded boundary conditions [8].\nDue to the underlying gauge invariance it is perhaps not surprising that the energy\nE of the bound state appears in the canonical form E \u2212 eA0 in (2.19), while the CM\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fmomentum k is kinematical since A = 0. The radial wave functions have singularities at\nr = 0 and at E \u2212 V (r) = 0. Requiring local normalizability at these points gave quantized\nenergy levels and a phenomenologically relevant spectrum, including asymptotically linear\nRegge trajectories [6]. The bound state equation reduces to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in\nthe non-relativistic limit (V \u001c E), in which case the singular point E \u2212 V (r) = 0 moves\nto r = \u221e.\nAt large quark separations r the linear potential V (r) dominates the rhs. of (2.19),\nand can be balanced only by a large derivative term on the lhs. Hence the qq\u0304 wave function\nis rapidly oscillating at large r, \u03c7 \u223c exp(ig\u039b2 r2 /4), and has an r-independent probability\ndensity. Since this wave function was derived using retarded boundary conditions it indirectly (via its negative energy components) describes the virtual \"sea\" quarks obtained\nwith physical boundary conditions. The normalization \u221d r of the wave function (2.19)\nplausibly reflects the quark pairs created by the large potential energy V (r) \u221d r. This\nquestion deserves further study.\nSince the wave function \u03c7k (x) describes constituents at equal time for all CM momenta\nk it is not explicitly Lorentz covariant. Nevertheless, if the bound state equation (2.19) is\naccurate to lowest order in ~ and p\ng the bound state energy must have the correct dependence\non the CM momentum, E(k) = k2 + M 2 . Remarkably, this turns out to be the case [9].\nThe k-dependence of the wave function is explicit in 1+1 dimensions. In 3+1 dimensions\n\u03c7k (x) with x k k can be expressed in terms of the k = 0 wave function. This also holds\nfor the first derivative of \u03c7k wrt. x \u22a5 k, which (numerically) allows to determine \u03c7k (x)\nfor all x from the k = 0 solution.\nThe k-dependence of the wave function \u03c7k and of its energy eigenvalues E(k) are\nfound as follows [9]. For k = (0, 0, k) along the z-axis, the bound state equation (2.19) for\n\u03c7k (0, 0, z) and its first derivatives \u2202i \u03c7k (0, 0, z), (i = x, y) become independent of k when\nthe coordinate z is expressed in terms of the \"boost invariant\" variable s defined by\ndz =\n\n2\nds\nE(k) \u2212 V (z)\n\n(2.20)\n\nIn the non-relativistic regime, V \u001c E, this is just the Lorentz contraction expected for\ndistances measured at equal time in every frame. The fact that the transformation is\ngoverned by the canonical energy E \u2212V (z) means that the contraction rate for a relativistic\nwave function is z-dependent. The Lorentz covariance of (2.19) requires furthermore that\nthe square of the canonical four-momentum P = (E \u2212 V, 0, 0, k) is frame independent when\nexpressed as a function of s. For a linear potential V (z) = g\u039b2 |z| the relation (2.20)\nintegrates (taking z > 0) to\ns = 12 z(E \u2212 21 V )\n(2.21)\nWith E 2 \u2212 k 2 = M 2 we then have indeed that\nP 2 = (E \u2212 V )2 \u2212 k 2 = M 2 \u2212 4g\u039b2 s\n\n(2.22)\n\nis independent of k. This seeming coincidence only holds for a linear potential.\nFor baryons I find a corresponding qqq bound state equation and a gauge where the\nwave function is fully antisymmetric in color. Stationarity of the action implies that the\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fcolor electric fields \u2207A03 and \u2207A08 point in separate directions, thus confining all three\nquarks. The relative strength A03 /A08 depends on the positions x1 , x2 , x3 of the quarks in\nsuch a way that the potential is the same for all permutations of quark colors. This allows\n(in a specific gauge) the simple color structure \u000fABC of the wave function, as assumed in\nthe quark model.\n\n3. Non-Relativistic QED Bound States\nSome aspects of the methods sketched above may be illustrated in the familiar case of\nnon-relativistic (NR) QED atoms, specifically muonium (e\u2212 \u03bc+ ). I use an equal-time,\nhamiltonian field theory approach which is close in spirit to the usual treatment in quantum\nmechanics. However, rather than reducing the problem to relative motion in a fixed central\npotential I determine the instantaneous A0 field by taking matrix elements of the QED\noperator equations of motion,\n\u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd (x) \u2212 e\n\nX\n\n\u03c8\u0304i (x)\u03b3 \u03bd \u03c8i (x) = 0\n\n(EOM)\n\n(3.1)\n\ni=e,\u03bc\n\nThe resulting A0 depends on the matrix element, and specifically on the positions of the\nelectron (x1 ) and muon (x2 ). Hence each Fock component of the bound state is assigned a\ndistinct potential A0 (x; x1 , x2 ). This is made possible by the instantaneity of A0 , which in\nturn is a consequence of the absence of a time derivative \u22020 A0 in gauge theory lagrangians.\nThe Coulomb gauge condition (\u2207 * A = 0) maintains the instantaneity of A0 and in this\nsense is preferable to covariant gauge fixing (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0).\nIn the NR limit we may ignore fermion pair production (I address the relativistic effects\nin Section 4). The dominance of the A0 potential4 and its instantaneous nature then implies\n\u0001\nthat only two-body |e\u2212 \u03bc+ i Fock states contribute at lowest O e2 in the coupling.\nI parametrize the e\u2212 \u03bc+ bound state at time t = 0 as\nZ\n|E, t = 0i = d3 y 1 d3 y 2 \u03c8e\u2020 (t = 0, y 1 )\u03c7(y 1 , y 2 )\u03c8\u03bc (t = 0, y 2 )|0i\n(3.2)\nwhere the wave function \u03c7(y 1 , y 2 ) is a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix in Dirac space5 . The free fermion\noperators of the Interaction Picture are as usual\nZ\n\u03c8(x) =\n\ni\nXh\nd3 p\n\u2212ip*x\nip*x \u2020\nu(p,\n\u03bb)e\nb\n+\nv(p,\n\u03bb)e\nd\np,\u03bb\np,\u03bb\n(2\u03c0)3 2Ep\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u03bb\n\nand satisfy the canonical anticommutation relation\nn\no\n\u03c8\u03b1 (t, x), \u03c8\u03b2\u2020 (t, x0 ) = \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 x0 )\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis holds only in the atomic rest frame. For atoms in relativistic CM motion also |f f \u0304\u03b3i Fock states\nwith a transverse photon contribute at lowest order [4].\n5\nI use a relativistic notation here and later reduce the wave function to its leading NR components.\n4\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fThe matrix elements of the EOM (3.1) for each |e\u2212 \u03bc+ i Fock component of the bound\nstate (3.2) at t = 0 should vanish,\n\u2020\nh0|\u03c8\u03bc\u03b2\n(0, x2 )\u03c8e\u03b1 (0, x1 ) (EOM) |E, 0i = 0\n\n(3.5)\n\nSince the Fock states do not contain physical (transverse) photons only the classical (instantaneous) A0 field survives in F \u03bc\u03bd (x) at lowest order in the coupling e.

Now there is no external field but rather a bound\nstate (3.2) which is a superposition of Fock states. The gauge field A0 is constrained\nfor each Fock component and each instant of time by the QED equation of motion. At\nlarge |x| the Coulomb field (3.8) vanishes faster than 1/|x| as appropriate for a neutral\nstate. Furthermore, (3.8) is the field of a single Fock component. A measurement of A0\nby an external probe would involve a sum over all Fock contributions weighted by their\nprobabilities. This ensures, e.g., the cancellation of the dipole field outside S-wave bound\nstates.\nFor \u03bd = j (= 1, 2, 3) in the EOM (3.1) the A0 field does not contribute in the matrix\nelement (3.5),\n\u03c7\u03b1\u03b2 (x1 , x2 ) * 0 = e \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 x1 )(\u03b3 0 \u03b3 j \u03c7)\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 e \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 x2 )(\u03c7\u03b3 0 \u03b3 j )\u03b1\u03b2 = 0\n\n(3.9)\n\nThis is satisfied at lowest order in the coupling e for NR QED atoms since the space\ncomponents j of the constituent currents are suppressed compared to their charge densities\nj 0 by a factor p/m \u223c \u03b1, where p is the relative momentum and m the mass scale of the\nconstituents. In analogy with the scaling of the upper and lower components of a Dirac\nwave function I expect (and verify below) that the wave function \u03c7(x1 , x2 ) has the Dirac\nstructure, in 2 \u00d7 2 block form,\n\uf8f1\n!\n\uf8f4\n=\nO (1)\n\uf8f2 \u03c712\n\u03c711 \u03c712\n(3.10)\n\u03c7=\n,\n\u03c711 , \u03c722 = O (p/m)\n\u0001\n\uf8f4\n\u03c721 \u03c722\n\uf8f3 \u03c7\n2\n2\n= O p /m\n21\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fFor the dominant Fock components described by \u03c712 the rhs. of the EOM (3.9) is thus\nsuppressed by p/m due to the off-diagonal nature of \u03b3 0 \u03b3 j . The EOM (3.6) for the other\ncomponents \u03c7ij is of higher order in e2 due to the suppression of the corresponding wave\nfunctions.\nHaving determined the A0 field (3.8) for each Fock component and verified that the\nEOM is consistent with A = 0 we may impose stationarity in time on the Fock amplitudes,\n\u2020\n\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2 (t; x1 , x2 ) \u2261 h0|\u03c8\u03bc\u03b2\n(t, x2 )\u03c8e\u03b1 (t, x1 )|E, ti = e\u2212iEt \u03c6\u03b1\u03b2 (t = 0; x1 , x2 )\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u03b1\u03b2 (t = 0; x1 , x2 ) = \u03c7\u03b1\u03b2 (x1 , x2 ) follows from the anticommutation relation (3.4).\nThe time dependence of the fermion fields is explicit in (3.3) while that of the state\n|E, ti is given by the interaction Hamiltonian\nZ\nX \u2020\nHI (t) = e d3 x A0 (x)\n\u03c8f (t, x)\u03c8f (t, x)\n(3.12)\nf =e,\u03bc\n\nHI actually appears with a factor 21 in Coulomb gauge quantization (see, e.g., Appendix\nA of [10]). Equivalently, and perhaps more intuitively, we may consider (3.12) as giving\nthe interaction energy of the electron and muon with the Coulomb field, but then need to\nconsider also the energy EA stored in the field, since it depends on the Fock state,\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nidt\n3\n\u03bc\u03bd\n3\n0\n2 0\n1\nexp idt d x(\u2212 4 F\u03bc\u03bd F ) = exp \u2212\nd x A (x)\u2207 A (x)\n2\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\ne2\n\u2261 exp(\u2212idtEA ) (3.13)\n= exp \u2212idt\n4\u03c0 |x1 \u2212 x2 |\nwhere I discarded an x1 , x2 -independent infinite phase (self-energy).

This is identical in form with the relativistic bound\nstate equation that I derive in Section 5, but presently valid only in the non-relativistic\nlimit where particle production and the transverse components of the gauge field A may\nbe ignored.\nThe reduction of (3.17) to the non-relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation is analogous to\nthe standard reduction of the Dirac equation.

The Dirac Equation\nThe electron equation of motion,\n/ \u2212 me )\u03c8(x) = 0\n(i\u2202/ \u2212 eA\n\n(4.1)\n\nfollows directly from the QED lagrangian and has precisely the form of the Dirac equation.\nHowever, (4.1) is an exact operator relation whereas the Dirac equation gives an approximate c-numbered amplitude \u03c8(x) for electron scattering in an external gauge field. The\nDirac equation may be derived from the field theoretic Bethe-Salpeter equation by considering e\u2212 \u03bc+ scattering in the limit where the muon mass tends to infinity [3]. Somewhat\nsurprisingly it turns out that the interaction kernel cannot be restricted to any finite order in the coupling e but must include an unlimited number of crossed photon exchanges,\nas also seen from Fig. 2. On the other hand, the Dirac equation does not include loop\ncorrections on the electron propagator or vertices.\nAs already discussed in Section 2.2, and pictorially shown in Fig. 4, the interaction\nhamiltonian (3.12) creates fermion pairs in the perturbative vacuum. Nevertheless, the\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fDirac (c-numbered) wave function \u03c8(t, x) at a given time depends on the coordinate x of a\nsingle (positive or negative energy) electron. This may be understood by considering elecQ\ntron scattering in the retarded vacuum (2.15), |0iR \u2261 N \u22121 p,\u03bb d\u2020p,\u03bb |0i, where the product\nextends over all positron momenta p and helicities \u03bb. With retarded boundary conditions\nboth positive and negative energy electrons propagate forward in time, Z-diagrams are\nabsent and according to (2.18) there is no particle production,\nHI |0iR = 0\n\n(4.2)\n\nIn a covariant perturbative description of electron scattering from a static potential\nA0 (x) the electron energy p0 is unchanged by the scattering. Hence, for p0 > 0 and in the\np\nabsence of loop integrals, the i\u03b5 prescription at the negative energy pole p0 = \u2212 p2 + m2e\nof the electron propagator S(p0 , p) is irrelevant. Consequently the bound state energies,\ni.e., the locations of the poles in the S-matrix, are the same for Feynman |0i and retarded\n|0iR boundary conditions. On the other hand, the Fourier transform p0 \u2192 t is sensitive to\nthe i\u03b5 prescription at the negative energy pole. The Dirac wave function \u03c8(t, x) describes\nthe single electron bound state obtained with retarded boundary conditions, thus hiding\nits true multi-pair Fock state structure.\nIt is straightforward to derive the standard Dirac equation for an electron bound by an\nexternal potential A0 (x) using the hamiltonian method of Section 3 in the |0iR vacuum.\nThe bound state at t = 0 is parametrized in terms of its 4-component wave function \u03c6(x)\nas\nZ\n|E, t = 0i \u2261\nd3 x\u03c8 \u2020 (t = 0, x)\u03c6(x)|0iR\nZ\ni\nXh\nd3 p\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n|0i\n+\nv\n(\u2212p,\n\u03bb)\u03c6(p)d\n|0i\n(4.3)\nu\n(p,\n\u03bb)\u03c6(p)b\n=\nR\nR\n\u2212p,\u03bb\np,\u03bb\n(2\u03c0)3 2Ep\n\u03bb\n\nThe negative energy components of \u03c6(p) describe a state where d\u2212p,\u03bb has removed a\npositive energy antifermion from |0iR . For the bound state to be stationary in time each\nFock state amplitude \u03c6(t, x) must satisfy\n\u03c6(t, x) \u2261 R h0|\u03c8(t, x)|E, ti = e\u2212iEt \u03c6(0, x)\n(4.4)\no\nn\nwhere \u03c6(0, x) = \u03c6(x) follows from \u03c8\u03b1 (t, x), \u03c8\u03b2\u2020 (t, x0 ) = \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 x0 ) \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 and \u03c8(x)|0iR = 0.\nThe time dependence of |E, ti is given by the interaction Hamiltonian (3.12). The\nstationarity requirement for the bound state at t = 0 is then\ni\n\nd\u03c6(0, x)\nd\u03c8(0, x)\n= R h0|i\n|E, 0i + R h0|\u03c8(0, x)HI |E, 0i = E\u03c6(0, x)\ndt\ndt\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe interaction picture fields satisfy\ni\n\nd\u03c8(t, x)\n= \u03b3 0 (\u2212i\u2207 * \u03b3 + me )\u03c8(t, x)\ndt\n\n(4.6)\n\nand, making use of R h0|\u03c8 \u2020 (t, x) = 0,\nR h0|\u03c8(0, x)HI |E, 0i\n\n= eA0 (x)\u03c6(x)\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n(4.7)\n\n\fUsing these relations in (4.5) gives the Dirac equation for the wave function \u03c6(x) of a\nbound state of energy E in the external potential A0 (x),\n(\u2212i\u2207 * \u03b3 + e\u03b3 0 A0 (x) + me )\u03c6(x) = E\u03b3 0 \u03c6(x)\n\n(4.8)\n\nThe time development of fermion states may equivalently be derived using functional\nintegral methods [11]. The retarded vacuum |0iR of (2.15) is then seen to correspond to a\nvacuum without a Dirac sea. I briefly recall this in the Appendix.\n\n5.

It is perhaps significant that a potential for more than\nthree quarks cannot be constructed analogously, as there are then more independent quark\nseparations than diagonal SU(3) generators.\n\n7. Discussion\nI presented an approach to gauge theory bound states that uses hamiltonian time evolution\nin Coulomb gauge at lowest order in ~, i.e., in the absence of loop corrections. The ~ \u2192 0\nlimit selects gauge field configurations for which the action is stationary. At each instant\nof time, and for each Fock component of the wave function, A0 (x) is determined by the\npositions of the charged constituents. The absence of loops (Born level) allows the use of\nretarded boundary conditions. This avoids the explicit appearance of higher Fock states\narising from time ordering (Z-graphs), without affecting the energies of the bound states.\nThe field equations determine A0 (x) only up to a homogeneous solution, which allows\nadding a linear term to the Coulomb potential. Such a term would not be acceptable in\nthe form of a fixed external potential, since it would break rotational invariance and imply\na field extending to spatial infinity. However, A0 (x) is a non-propagating field which is\ndetermined by the positions of the charged constituents at each instant of time. Stationarity\nof the action requires a linear potential term to be oriented along the charge separation in\neach Fock component, ensuring rotational invariance. For neutral states the coherent sum\nof the contributions to A0 (x \u2192 \u221e) from the various Fock states cancels, thus avoiding a\nlong-range field external to the bound state.\nA linear potential implies confinement and is thus of obvious interest for QCD. The\npresent semi-classical approach does not predict its magnitude nor why such a term should\nbe present in QCD but not in QED. As seen from (2.3) a linear term gives a contribution\nto the instantaneous action which is proportional the volume of space, and thus appears\nas a boundary condition related to vacuum structure which is motivated by data. Its\nderivation from theory would require methods beyond the semi-classical approximation,\nsuch as lattice gauge calculations or the use of Dyson-Schwinger equations [12, 13].\nIn a purely Coulombic bound state the constituent velocity scales as v \u223c \u03b1. Hence\n> 1, for which the use of perturbative\nrelativistic motion v ' 1 requires a large coupling \u03b1 \u223c\nmethods cannot be justified. A linear potential of strength g\u039b2 dominates, in a perturbative\n\u0001\nsense, gluon exchange interactions of O g 2 . This enables the study of relativistic bound\nstates even for small values of the gauge coupling g. The phenomenological success of the\nQuark Model, which uses a combination of a linear and an O (\u03b1s ) perturbative potential,\nindicates that the strong coupling may freeze at a sufficiently small value to justify the use\nof a perturbative expansion even for hadrons.\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\fSymmetries of the lagrangian are maintained at each order of ~ and g. The frame\ndependence of wave functions defined at equal time of the constituents is non-trivial, since\nboosts are dynamical operators which do not commute with the hamiltonian. In the case of\na purely linear potential the energy eigenvalues E of the bound state equation (2.19) were\nfound [9] to have the correct dependence on the CM momentum k. The wave functions are\nrelated by a generalized Lorentz contraction (2.20), with a length scale proportional to the\ninverse canonical energy 1/(E \u2212 V ) instead of 1/E. To my knowledge this is the only case\nwhere an explicit relation between equal-time wave functions in different frames has been\nestablished, and it deserves further study. It may allow to relate spherically symmetric wave\nfunctions in the rest frame with the infinite momentum frame wave functions corresponding\nto quantization on the light-cone. The latter wave functions are invariant under boosts but\ndefined wrt. a fixed direction in space [14].\nThe wave functions have a rapidly oscillating phase \u223c exp(irV (r)/4) at distances\nr between the constituents where the linear potential V (r) \u001d E. Hence the relative\nmomentum between the bound state constituents can be large, allowing support for quark\ndistributions at low x in DIS, as well as Regge type quark exchange between hadrons\nscattering at high energies. This is interesting also in view of the linear Regge trajectories\nfound in the spectrum [6].\nThe meson and baryon solutions found here are essentially equivalent to those in [8],\nwhich relied on some ad hoc assumptions. The present framework is based on a power\nexpansion in ~ and g and thus close to a systematic derivation of bound states from the\nlagrangian. This should allow to address further issues, checking the viability of the method\npresented here. Many open questions obviously remain. A central outstanding issue is\nwhether spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking can be described at the semi-classical level,\ne.g., using a chirally non-invariant vacuum state. It is also essential to demonstrate that\nloop corrections can be systematically evaluated.\n\nAcknowledgments\nMy special thanks are due to Stan Brodsky for sharing his insights into bound state\nstructure and for continuously inspiring discussions.
