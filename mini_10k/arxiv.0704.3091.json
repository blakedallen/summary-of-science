This note gives an explicit formula for the elements of the E8 root system. The\nformula is triacontagonally symmetric in that one may clearly see an action by the cyclic\ngroup with 30 elements. The existence of such a formula is due to the fact that the Coxeter\nnumber of E8 is 30.\nKeywords. Exceptional root system.\nAMS 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 17B25, 20F55.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Coxeter numbers of H4 and E8 are both equal to 30, [6]. Some artistically-inclined\nmathematicians have used this fact in order to depict these root systems. In so doing,\neach has necessarily produced a figure having triacontagonal symmetry, meaning the same\nsymmetry as a regular 30-sided polygon. According to [3], where it is used as the frontispiece,\nvan Oss first sketched such a projection of the regular polytope having Schl\u00e4fli symbol\n{3, 3, 5}, also known as the \"600-cell\". The vertices of {3, 3, 5} coincide with the elements\nof the (non-crystallographic) root system H4 . One may also find this sketch in the article\n[8] and a sketch of the dual polytope {5, 3, 3} in [1].\nThe roots of E8 coincide with the vertices of a highly symmetric convex polytope 421 apparently discovered by Gosset, [3, 5], and also with the vertices of a regular complex polytope\n3{3}3{3}3{3}3 discovered by Witting, [4, 2]. The book [4] displays a triacontagonal projection of 3{3}3{3}3{3}3 and [2] displays a triacontagonal projection of 421 . According to [7],\nPeter McMullen sketched the triacontagonal projections of both of these polytopes by hand\nduring a period lasting from August 18 until August 20 in 1964. Recently John Stembridge\nproduced an 8-color computer sketch of 421 , to supplement an announcement by a research\ngroup at the American Institute of Mathematics of having computed a particular class of\nrepresentations of a real Lie group having the E8 root system. A simplified sketch is offered\nhere, showing only the relative locations of the 240 vectors, in 8 concentric cycles with 30\npoints per cycle.\nHere is a streamlined\nversion of the formula from [3] for the elements of the H4 root system.\n\u0001\ni\u03c0\nand a > b > c > d be the positive roots of the polynomial 45x8 \u2212 90x6 +\nLet \u03c9 = exp 30\n60x4 \u2212 15x2 + 1 over R. Then the 120 vectors\nAn = (a\u03c9 2n , d\u03c9 22n ),\nBn = (b\u03c9 2n+1 , c\u03c9 22n+11 ),\n2n+1\n22n+11\nCn = (c\u03c9\n, \u2212b\u03c9\n), Dn = (d\u03c9 2n , \u2212a\u03c9 22n ),\n1\n\n\fwhere n \u2208 {0, 1, 2, ..., 28, 29}, comprise the H4 root system. This formula has the feature\nthat projecting along the first coordinate, essentially forgetting the second coordinate, yields\nthe triacontagonal projection of the H4 roots. The purpose of this note is to give a similar\nformula for the E8 root system.\nThe triacontagonal projections of the H4 and E8 root systems are closely related. The latter\nis the union of two scaled\u221asizes\n\u0001 of the former, where the ratio of the larger to the smaller is the\ngolden ratio \u03c4 = 12 1 + 5 . Given this, one expects that a similar formula should exist for\nthe E8 roots. Indeed, the formula given here was obtained by \"guess-and-check\". Checking\nis tedious, but one may use Maple, for example, to compute as many inner products as are\nnecessary to become convinced that the formula yields a root system isomorphic to E8 . (A\nmore \"ethical\" way to obtain the formula would be to diagonalize a Coxeter element of the\nCoxeter group of E8 . However, this author believes that the ends could not possibly justify\nthe enormity of the computations involved in such means.)\n\nFigure 1.

Each phase shift was chosen so that {An , Bn , Cn , Dn , En , Fn , Gn , Hn } is a\nsystem of simple roots for any fixed value of n.\nBn\nEn\nt\nt\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745t\nt\nFn\nAn\n\nGn\nt\n\nHn\nt\n\nt\nCn\n\nt\nDn\n\nFigure 2.

Alternatively, one may use\nthe amplitudes\nr1 = 1,\nr2 = c11 ,\nr3 = c6 c13 , r4 = c6 c14 ,\nr5 = c12 , r6 = c11 c12 , r7 = c13 ,\nr8 = c14 .\nIn so doing, one avoids the complicated definition/formulae for the values {a, b, c, d} given\nabove. For example, using this choice of amplitudes facilitates the verification of the formula,\nfor then all the coordinates lie in the cyclotomic field Q(\u03c9). The tradeoff is that the norms\nof the vectors are more complicated to express.\n\nReferences\n[1] Chilton, B. L. On the projection of the regular polytope {5, 3, 3} into a regular triacontagon.
