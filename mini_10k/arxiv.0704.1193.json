Sood\nPhysics Department, Government College (GCG -11),\nChandigarh, 160011, India.\ngopika@hepphys.com\nReceived (received date)\nRevised (revised date)\nWe propose a novel method for studying the production of anticentauro events in high\nenergy heavy ion collisions utilizing Chebyshev expansion coefficients. These coefficients\nhave proved to be very efficient in investigating the pattern of fluctuations in neutral\npion fraction. For the anticentauro like events, the magnitude of first few coefficients is\nstrongly enhanced (\u22483 times) as compared to those of normal HIJING events. Various\ncharacteristics of Chebyshev coefficients are studied in detail and the probability of\nformation of exotic events is calculated from the simulated events.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions the rapid expansion of collision debris leads\nto the production of vacuum states with anomalous chiral order parameters. As a\nresult of this, interior vacuum straighten out and radiate away its pionic orientation.\nIf the deflection of vacuum orientation is in the \u03c0 0 direction all the condensate\nradiation will be \u03c0 0 . On the other side, if deflection is orthogonal to the \u03c0 0 direction\nall the emitted pions will be charged. The former case is called \"Anti-centauro\"\nbehavior and the latter is \"Centauro\". Both of these type of events are detected in\nthe cosmic ray experiments 1 . Various models 2 have been developed to understand\nthe characteristics of these events and numerous signatures 3 for identification of\nsuch events are suggested.\nThe LHC facility 4 at CERN will soon be operational and it would be interesting\nto search for anomalous events of centauro/anticentauro nature at LHC energies.\nFurther, it is expected that at these high energies the production of exotic events\nwill be enormous. So, it is useful to perform a theoretical simulation to identify\nthe specific variables and mathematical techniques that may be informative in this\nstudy. The primary and widely accepted signal for observing these events is to\nlook for anomalous fluctuations in neutral pion fraction (correspondingly, large\nfluctuations in the energy ratio, electromagnetic to hadronic). In this paper, we\nintroduce a technique of Chebyshev coefficients 5 to study the fluctuations in the\n1\n\n\fOctober 30, 2018 5:7\n\n2\n\nWSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nqmposter\n\nG. Sood\n\nneutral pion fraction.\n2. Characteristics of Chebyshev polynomials\nChebyshev polynomials are actively used in the field of mathematics for computing\nthe derivative/integral of a non-singular function in the finite domain and in solving\nvarious differential equations 6 . In the High Energy Physics area, this method is\napplied in the track reconstruction procedure 7 , vertex calculation and in studying\nthe pattern of fluctuations 8 . The advantage of Chebyshev expansion technique\nis that it can be extended to any variable and it can be easily applied to any\nexperimental data. In this paper, we have used this novel technique to study the\nfluctuations in the azimuthal distribution of neutral pions to the total number of\npions produced in an event. The neutral pion fraction, f (\u03c6), can be expanded in\nterms of sum of Chebyshev polynomials as :\nC0 X\n+\nCk Tk (\u03c6)\n2\nN\n\nf (\u03c6) =\n\n(1)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere Tk (\u03c6) is the Chebyshev polynomial of degree k. The coefficients Cj , j=0, 1,\n2, * * * , N-1, of Chebyshev expansion are defined as\nN\n2 X\nf (\u03c6k )Tj\u22121 (\u03c6k )\nN\n\n(2)\n\nN\n\u03c0(j \u2212 1)(k \u2212 12 )\n\u03c0(k \u2212 21 )\n2 X\n)]cos(\n)\nf [cos(\nN\nN\nN\n\n(3)\n\nCj =\n\nk=1\n\nCj =\n\nk=1\n\nThe coefficients of Chebyshev polynomial carry all the information on the fluctuation of f (\u03c6). The useful measures are provided by ranking the coefficients, Ck , in\norder of the magnitude of the absolute values, i.e.,\n| C0 | > | C1 | > | C2 | > | C3 | * * *\n\n(4)\n\nThe magnitude and range of these coefficients define the strength and level of\nfluctuations present in the data sample.\n3. Simulation\nThe cosmic ray evidence on \"anti-centauro events\" serve as a great motivation for\nperforming an exotic event search at Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Therefore, for\nany study, in this direction, it is essential to follow the hints and inferences provided\nby the cosmic ray experiments. We have taken the spectacular JACEE prototype\n9 as a reference for generating the anticentauro events artificially. The standard\nMonte Carlo program, HIJING, is used to simulate minimum biased (0-20 fm) PbPb collisions at LHC energies. Default values are taken for all the parameters.

The anticentauro\n\u221a\nevent is modeled according to the (1/2 f ) distribution. For the present simulation,\na domain of size 60\u25e6 is injected into the normal HIJING event. This is established\nby flipping the charged pions into neutral pions unless they attain a value of the\nneutral pion fraction, f \u2265 0.9.\n4. Analysis\nWe calculate the neutral pion fraction, f , for the generated data sets (HIJING as\nwell as \"anticentauro like events\") in the \u2206\u03b7 \u2212 \u2206\u03c6 phase space as,\nn\u03c0 0\nf=\n(5)\nn\u03c0 0 + n\u03c0 \u00b1\nThis calculation is performed on an event-by-event basis for various azimuthal bins,\nviz, \u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03c0/18, 2\u03c0/9, 2\u03c0/6, 2\u03c0/4, 2\u03c0/3, \u03c0 and 2\u03c0 and in the broad pseudorapidity\nregion (\u03b7 = -10 to 10). The Chebyshev coefficients corresponding to the computed\nneutral pion fraction are determined according to the equation 3, as described in\nsection II. Various characteristics of Chebyshev polynomials are investigated in view\nof their ability to pick up the events with anomalous fluctuations in the neutral pion\nfraction. The details are described below :\n4.1. First order coefficients\nThe first Chebyshev coefficient, C0 , for \u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03c0/18, for normal events (f = 0.33) is\nplotted in Fig. 1.

This is an ideal choice for comparison as there are no hidden fluctuations\npresent in this sample and it purely represents the true nature of the system. In the\nsame figure, we have plotted the first order coefficient (C0 ), for the anticentauro\nlike events (solid line). The absolute value of the magnitude of this coefficient is\nlarge as compared to that of normal events. Similar behavior is observed for other\norder coefficients, i.e., for the exotic events the value of coefficients is significantly\nenhanced as compared to the normal events. Table 1. describes the detailed results\nof the variation of absolute magnitude of first order coefficient, C0 , with azimuth,\nfor the top 5% central events. The mean value of the coefficient, C0 , for anticenturo like events is approximately thrice the mean value of normal HIJING events.\nIt is observed that with increase in size of domain the magnitude of coefficients\ndecreases. This behavior is seen for both HIJING and anticentauro like events but\nthe magnitude of the coefficients for exotic events is much more than normal events\nfor all the azimuthal bins.\n\n4.2. Higher order coefficients\nThe coefficients of higher degree Chebyhshev polynomial, Ck for 0\u2264 k \u2264 N-1 contain\nall the information of fluctuations. In our study, we have calculated 100 coefficients,\nC0 to C99 . All these coefficients, Ck (k = 0, 99) are pure Gaussian (for normal\nHIJING events), however, the absolute values of their magnitude decreases very\nrapidly. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of some higher order coefficients, C30 , C40 , C50\nand C90 . It is observed that higher order coefficients gradually attain the null value.\nTherefore, the Chebyshev expansion series can be truncated at some order m < N\nand the extreme higher order coefficients are neglected. It is important to note that\nthe absolute value of the magnitude of higher order coefficients for the \"anticentauro\nlike events\" is still much higher than the corresponding HIJING events as observed\nfor the first order coefficient.\n\n\fOctober 30, 2018 5:7\n\nWSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nqmposter\n\nProduction of Anti-centauro events in ...\n\n5\n\n4.3. Correlation of Chebyshev coefficients\nThe magnitude and range of the Chebyshev coefficients is very useful in predicting\nwhether or not the fluctuations in the neutral pion fraction are of non-statistical\nnature. A more critical criteria can be evolved by considering the two coefficients\nsimultaneously. For this, it is necessary to study the correlation between various\ncoefficients. Fig 3. shows the relationship between the two consecutive coefficients\nC1 and C2 . It is seen that the coefficients are correlated i.e., with increase in C1 ,\nthe coefficient C2 also increases. Similar behavior is observed for other coefficients.\nThe corresponding magnitude of coefficients for HIJING events is very less.\n\n2\n\n0\n103\nNo. of events\n\n-2\nC2\n-4\n\n102\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-8\n1\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\ncj\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFig. 2.

Probability function: An estimate from simulation\nA more quantitative way to analyze fluctuations is to estimate the production of\nanticentauro events from simulation. For this, we define a probability function P,\nwhich is the fraction of events which have the magnitude of first order coefficient, C0 ,\ngreater than the threshold set by the sum of mean first order coefficient, obtained\nfrom HIJING events and five times the dispersion (< C0 > +5\u03c3). For all the\nanticentauro events, the absolute value of the magnitude of first order coefficient is\nmuch greater than the set threshold but for the HIJING events we do not observe\nany event which satisfies the above criteria. As an example, for the azimuthal bin,\n\u2206\u03c6 = 2\u03c0/6, all the artificially generated anticentauro events have magnitude of the\nfirst order coefficient (C0 = 42.7) which is much higher than the threshold value\n\n\fOctober 30, 2018 5:7\n\n6\n\nWSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\nqmposter\n\nG. Sood\n\n(17.21). The corresponding statistical probability obtained from HIJING events is\nP (C0 > 17.21) = 0\n\n(6)\n\nFor the semi-central events the probability is\nP (C0 > 16.61) = 2.2x10\u22123\n\n(7)\n\nSimilar behavior is observed for the other azimuthal bins. Thus, for the generated\nexotic events, high value of neutral pion fraction in the \u03b7 -\u03c6 phase space is clearly\nexhibited by high magnitude of the Chebyshev coefficient whereas statistically the\nprobability of formation of exotic event is either 0 or very small.\n5. Summary\nIn this study, we have described a method of Chebyshev polynomials to study the\nfluctuations in the neutral pion fraction of artificially generated anticentauro events\nfor Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies. This method is proved to be very efficient\nto measure the strength of fluctuations. Our analysis shows that the magnitude of\nhigher range first order coefficients for exotic events is approximately 3 times greater\nthan those of normal events. This trend is seen for other higher range coefficients.\nThe detailed analysis is carried out by estimating the probability of formation of\nexotic events from the normal events.\nReferences\n1. C.
