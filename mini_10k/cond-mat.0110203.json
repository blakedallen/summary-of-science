Such measures appear naturally in\na variety of nonlinear-physics context, the most well studied being natural measures of chaotic dynamcial systems\n[1, 2, 3]. Other well studied examples are the voltage\ndistribution of random resistor networks [4, 5]. In this\npaper we address the harmonic measure of Diffusion Limited Aggregates [6], which is the probability measure for\na random walker coming from infinity to hit the boundary of the fractal cluster. This was one of the earliest\nmultifractal measures to be studied in the physics literature [7], but the elucidation of its properties was made\ndifficult by the extreme variation of the probability to\nhit the tips of a DLA versus hitting the deep fjords.\nWith usual numerical techniques it is quite impossible\nto estimate accurately the extremely small probabilities\nto penetrate the fjords. Contrary to harmonic measures\nof conformally invariant fractals like random walks and\npercolation clusters whose multifractal properties can be\nsolved exactly [8, 9], the present multifractal measure\nposed stubborn barriers to mathematical progress.\nThe multifractal properties of fractal measures in general, and of the harmonic measure of DLA in particular,\nare conveniently studied in the context of the generalized\ndimensions Dq , and the associated f (\u03b1) function [10, 11].\nThe simplest definition of the generalized dimensions is\nin terms of a uniform covering of the boundary of a DLA\ncluster with boxes of size l, and measuring the probability for a random walker coming from infinity to hit a piece\nof boundary which belongs to the i'th box. Denoting this\nprobability by Pi (l), one considers [10]\nP\n1 log i Piq (l)\nDq \u2261 lim\n,\n(1)\nl\u21920 q \u2212 1\nlog l\nwhere the index i runs over all the boxes that contain\na piece of the boundary. The limit D0 \u2261 limq\u21920+ Dq\nis the fractal, or box dimension of the cluster. D1 \u2261\nlimq\u21921+ Dq and D2 are the well known information and\n\ncorrelation dimensions respectively [2, 12, 13]. It is well\nestablished by now [11] that the existence of an interesting spectrum of values Dq is related to the probabilities\nPi (l) having a spectrum of \"singularities\" in the sense\nthat Pi (l) \u223c l\u03b1 with \u03b1 taking on values from a range\n\u03b1min \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b1max . The frequency of observation of a\nparticular value of \u03b1 is determined by the the function\nf (\u03b1) where (with \u03c4 (q) \u2261 (q \u2212 1)Dq )\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2202\u03c4 (q)\n= \u03b1(q) . (2)\nf (\u03b1) = \u03b1q(\u03b1) \u2212 \u03c4 q (\u03b1) ,\n\u2202q\nThe understanding of the multifractal properties and\nthe associated f (\u03b1) spectrum of DLA clusters have been\na long standing issue. Of particular interest are the values of the minimal and maximal values, \u03b1min and \u03b1max ,\nrelating to the largest and smallest growth probabilities,\nrespectively.\nThe minimal value of \u03b1 is relatively easy to estimate,\nsince it has to do with the scaling of the harmonic measure near the most probable tip. While the often cited\nTurkevich-Scher conjecture [14] that \u03b1min satisfies the\nscaling relation D0 = 1 + \u03b1min is probably not exact, it\ncomes rather close to the mark. On the other hand, the\nmaximal value of \u03b1 is a much more subtle issue. As a\nDLA cluster grows the large branches screen the deep\nfjords more and more and the probability for a random\nwalker to get into these fjords (say around the seed of the\ncluster) becomes smaller and smaller. A small growth\nprobability corresponds to a large value of \u03b1. Previous literature hardly agrees about the actual value of\n\u03b1max . Ensemble averages of the harmonic measure of\nDLA clusters indicated a rather large value of \u03b1max \u223c 8\n[15]. In subsequent experiments on non-Newtonian fluids [16] and on viscous fingers [17], similar large values\nof \u03b1max were also observed. These numerical and experimental indications of a very large value of \u03b1max led to a\nconjecture that, in the limit of a large, self-similar cluster some fjords will be exponentially screened and thus\ncausing \u03b1max \u2192 \u221e [18].\nIf indeed \u03b1max \u2192 \u221e, this can be interpreted as a phase\ntransition [19] (non-analyticity) in the q dependence of\n\n\f2\nDq , at a value of q \u2217 satisfying q \u2217 \u2265 0. If the transition\ntakes place for a value q \u2217 < 0 then \u03b1max is finite. Lee and\nStanley [20] proposed that \u03b1max diverges like R2 / ln R\nwith R being the radius of the cluster. Schwarzer et al.\n[21] proposed that \u03b1max diverges only logarithmically in\nthe number of added particles. Blumenfeld and Aharony\n[22] proposed that channel-shaped fjords are important\nx\nand proposed that \u03b1max \u223c lnMM where M is the mass\nof the cluster; Harris and Cohen [23], on the other hand,\nargued that straight channels might be so rare that they\ndo not make a noticeable contribution, and \u03b1max is finite,\nin agreement with Ball and Blumenfeld who proposed\n[24] that \u03b1max is bounded. Obviously, the issue was not\nquite settled. The difficulty is that it is very hard to\nestimate the smallest growth probabilities using models\nor direct numerical simulations.\nIn a recent Letter [25] we used the method of iterated\nconformal maps to offer an accurate determination of the\nprobability for the rarest events. The main result that\nwas announced was that \u03b1max exists and the phase transition occurs at a q value that is slightly negative. In the\npresent paper we discuss the results in greater detail, and\noffer additional insights to the geometric interpretation\nof the phase transition. In Sect. 2 we summarize briefly\nthe method of iterated conformal maps and explain how\nit is employed to compute the harmonic measure of DLA\nwith unprecedented accuracy. In Sect. 3 we perform the\nmultifractal analysis and present the calculation of the\nf (\u03b1) curve. In Sect. 4 we discuss a complementary point\nof view of the scaling properties of the rarest regions of\nthe measure, to achieve in Sect. 5 a geometric interpretation of the phase transition. Sect. 6 offers a short\ndiscussion.\nII.\n\nACCURATE CALCULATION OF THE\nHARMONIC MEASURE\nA.\n\nDLA via iterated conformal maps\n\nConsider a DLA of n particles and denote the boundary of the cluster by z(s) where s is an arc-length paramterization. Invoke now a conformal map \u03a6(n) (\u03c9) which\nmaps the exterior of the unit circle in the mathematical\nplane \u03c9 onto the complement of the cluser of n particle in\nthe z plane. On the unit circle ei\u03b8 the harmonic measure\nis uniform, P (\u03b8)d\u03b8 = d\u03b8/2\u03c0. The harmonic measure of\nan element ds on the cluster in the physical space is then\ndetermined as\nP (s)ds \u223c\n\nds\n.\n|\u03a6\u2032 (n) (ei\u03b8 )|\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a6(n) (ei\u03b8 ) = z(s). Note that in electrostatic par\u2032\nlance 1/|\u03a6 (n) (\u03c9)| is the electric field at the position\n(n)\nz = \u03a6 (\u03c9). Thus in principle, if we can have an accurate value of the conformal map \u03a6(n) (\u03c9) for all values\n\u03c9 = ei\u03b8 we can compute the harmonic measure with desired precision. We will see that this is easier said than\n\ndone, but nevertheless this is the basic principle of our\napproach.\nWe thus need to find the conformal map \u03a6(n) (\u03c9). An\nexcellent method for this purpose was developed in a recent series of papers [26, 27, 28]. The map \u03a6(n) (w) is\nmade from compositions of elementary maps \u03c6\u03bb,\u03b8 ,\n\u03a6(n) (w) = \u03a6(n\u22121) (\u03c6\u03bbn ,\u03b8n (w)) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the elementary map \u03c6\u03bb,\u03b8 transforms the unit circle\n\u221a\nto a circle with a semi-circular \"bump\" of linear size \u03bb\naround the point w = ei\u03b8 . We use below the same map\n\u03c6\u03bb,\u03b8 that was employed in [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. With this\nmap \u03a6(n) (w) adds on a semi-circular new bump to the\nimage of the unit circle under \u03a6(n\u22121) (w). The bumps in\nthe z-plane simulate the accreted particles in the physical\nspace formulation of the growth process. Since we want\nto have fixed size bumps in the physical space, say of\nfixed area \u03bb0 , we choose in the nth step\n\u03bbn =\n\n\u03bb0\n\u2032\n|\u03a6(n\u22121) (ei\u03b8n )|2\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nThe recursive dynamics can be represented as iterations\nof the map \u03c6\u03bbn ,\u03b8n (w),\n\u03a6(n) (w) = \u03c6\u03bb1 ,\u03b81 \u25e6 \u03c6\u03bb2 ,\u03b82 \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03c6\u03bbn ,\u03b8n (\u03c9) .\n\n(6)\n\nIt had been demonstrated before that this method represents DLA accurately, providing many analytic insights\nthat are not available otherwise [29, 30].\nB.\n\nComputing the harmonic measure\n\nIn terms of computing the harmonic measure we note\nthe close relationship between Eqs.(3) and (5). Clearly,\nmoments of the harmonic measure can be computed from\nmoments of \u03bbn . For our purposes here we quote a result\nestablished in [27], which is\nZ 2\u03c0\nh\u03bbqn i \u2261 (1/2\u03c0)\n\u03bbqn (\u03b8)d\u03b8 \u223c n\u22122qD2q+1 /D . (7)\n0\n\nTo compute \u03c4 (q) we rewrite this average as\nZ\nZ\n\u03bbq+1/2 (s)\nd\u03b8\nq\nq\n\u03bbn (s) = ds \u221a\nh\u03bbn i = ds\n,\nds\n\u03bb0\n\n(8)\n\nwhere s is the arc-length of the physical boundary of\nthe cluster.\np In the last equality we used the fact that\n|d\u03b8/ds| = \u03bbn /\u03bb0 . We stress at this point that in order\nto measure these moments for q \u2264 0 we must go into\narc-length representation.\nTo make this crucial point clear we discuss briefly what\nhappens if one attempts to compute the moments from\nthe definition (7). Having at hand the conformal map\n\u03a6(n) (ei\u03b8 ), one can choose randomly as many points on\nthe unit circle [0, 2\u03c0] as one wishes, obtain as many (accurate) values of \u03bbn , and try to compute the integral\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: A typical growth process in which an existing branchcut is \"burried\" under the new bump. Such events reduce the\nnumber of branch cuts below 2n with n being the number of\nparticles.\n\nOn the left hand side we have the resolution in the physical space relative to the fixed linear size of the particles.\nWith double precission numerics we can resolve values of\n\u2206\u03b8 \u223c 10\u221216 and since we know that the values of \u03bb30000\ncan be as small as 10\u221270 inside the deepest fjords (and\nsee below), we see that\n10\u221216\n\u2206s\n\u221a \u223c \u221235 = 1019 .\n10\n\u03bb0\n\nFIG. 1: panel a: the boundary of the cluster probed by a\nrandom search with respect to the harmonic measure. Panel\nb: the boundary of the cluster probed by the present method.\n\nas a finite sum. The problem is of course that using\nsuch an approach the fjords are not resolved. To see this\nwe show in Fig.1 panel a the region of a typical cluster of 50 000 particles that is being visited by a random\nsearch on the unit circle, with 50 000 samples. Like in\ndirect simulations using random walks, the rarest events\nare not probed, and no serious conclusion regarding the\nphase transition is possible. Another method that cannot work is to try to compute h\u03bbqn i by sampling on the\narc-length in a naive way. The reason is that the inverse\nmap [\u03a6(n) ]\u22121 (s) cannot resolve \u03b8 values that belong to\ndeep fjords. As the growth proceeds, reparametrization\nsqueezes the \u03b8 values that map to fjords into minute intervals, below the computer numerical resolution. To see\nthis, consider the following estimate of the resolution we\ncan achieve in the physical space,\n\u2206\u03b8 =\n\n\u221a\n\u2206s\n\u2206s\n= \u03bbn \u221a ,\n\u2032\n(n)\n\u03a6\n\u03bb0\n\n(9)\n\nor equivalently\n\u2206\u03b8\n\u2206s\n\u221a =\u221a\n.\n\u03bb0\n\u03bbn\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nTherefore the resolution in the physcial space which is\nnecessary to achieve a meaningful probe of the deep fjord\nis highly inappropriate.\nThe bottom line is that to compute the values of \u03bbn (s)\neffectively we must use the full power of our iterated conformal dynamics, carrying the history with us, to iterate\nforward and backward at will to resolve accurately the \u03b8\nand \u03bbn values associated with any given particle on the\nfully grown cluster.\nTo do this we recognize that every time we grow a semicircular bump we generate two new branch-cuts in the\nmap \u03a6(n) . We find the position on the boundary between\nevery two branch-cuts, and there compute the value of\n\u03bbn . The first step in our algorithm is to generate the location of these points intermediate to the branch-cuts [31].\nEach branch-cut has a preimage on the unit circle which\nk(l)\nk(l)\nwill be indexed with 3 indices, wj,l \u2261 exp[i\u03b8j,l ]. The\nindex j represents the generation when the branch-cut\nwas created (i.e. when the jth particle was grown). The\nindex l stands for the generation at which the analysis is\nbeing done (i.e. when the cluster has l particles). The index k represents the position of the branch-cut along the\narc-length, and it is a function of the generation l. Note\nthat since bumps may overlap during growth, branchcuts are then covered, cf. Fig. 2. Therefore the maximal\nk, kmax \u2264 2l. After each iteration the preimage of each\nbranch-cut moves on the unit circle, but its physical position remains. This leads to the equation that relates\nthe indices of a still exposed branch-cut that was created\n\n\f4\nat generation j to a later generation n:\n\u0011\n\u0010\nk\u0303(j)\nk(n)\n\u22121\n)\n(w\n\u25e6\n.\n.\n.\n\u25e6\n\u03c6\n\u03a6(n) (wj,n ) \u2261 \u03a6(n) \u03c6\u22121\nj,j\n\u03bbj+1 ,\u03b8j+1\n\u03bbn ,\u03b8n\nk\u0303(j)\n\n= \u03a6(j) (wj,j ) .\n\n(12)\n\nNote that the sorting indices k\u0303(j) are not simply related\nto k(n), and need to be tracked as follows. Suppose\nk(n\u22121)\nthat the list wj,n\u22121 is available. In the nth generation we choose randomly a new \u03b8n , and find two new\nbranch-cuts which on the unit circle are at angles \u03b8n\u00b1 . If\none (or very rarely more) branch-cut of the updated list\nk(n\u22121)\n\u03c6\u22121\n\u03bbn ,\u03b8n (wj,n\u22121 ) is covered, it is eliminated from the list,\nand together with the sorted new pair we make the list\nk(n)\nwj,n .\nNext let us find the mid-positions at which we want to\ncompute the value of \u03bbn . Having a cluster of n particles\nk(n)\nwe now consider all neighboring pairs of preimages wj,n\nk(n)+1\n\n, that very well may have been created at two\nand wJ,n\ndifferent generations j and J. The larger of these indices\n(J without loss of generality) determines the generation\nof the intermediate position at which we want to compute\nk(n)\nthe field. We want to find the preimage uJ,J of this\nmid-point on the unit circle , to compute \u03bbk(n) there\naccurately. Using definition (12) we find the preimage\nk(n)\n\nk\u0303(J)\n\nk\u0303(J)+1\n\narg(uJ,J ) = [arg(wj,J ) + arg(wJ,J\n\n)]/2 .\n\n(13)\n\nIn Fig.1 panel b we show, for the same cluster of 50 000,\nk(n)\nthe map \u03a6(J) (uJ,J ) with k(n) running between 1 and\nkmax , with J being the corresponding generation of creation of the mid point. We see that now all the particles\nare probed, and every single value of \u03bbk(n) can be computed.\nTo compute these \u03bbk(n) accurately, we define (in analogy to Eq.(12)) for every J < m \u2264 n\nk(n)\n\nk(n)\n\n\u22121\nuJ,m \u2261 \u03c6\u22121\n\u03bbm ,\u03b8m \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03c6\u03bbj+1 ,\u03b8j+1 (uJ,J ) .\n\n(14)\n\nFinally \u03bbk(n) is computed from the definition (5) with\n\u03a6\n\n(n) \u2032\n\nk(n)\n(uJ,n )\n\n=\n\u00d7\n\nk(n)\nk(n)\n\u03c6\u2032\u03bbn ,\u03b8n (uJ,n ) * * * \u03c6\u2032\u03bbJ+1 ,\u03b8J+1 (uJ,J+1 )\n\u2032 k(n)\n(15)\n\u03a6(J) (uJ,J ) .\n\nWe wish to emphasize the relevance of this equation:\nthe problem with the coarse resolution that was exposed\nby Eq. (11) occurs only inside the deepest fjords. We\nnote however that the particles inside the deep fjords\nwere deposited when the clusters were still very small.\nFor small clusters the resolution of the fjords does not\npose a difficult problem. Therefore, when we evaluate\nthe derivative \u03a6(n) inside the deepest fjord at a point\nk(n)\nuJ,n , we make use of the fact that J \u226a n and write the\nderivative in the form\n\u2032\n\nk(n)\n\n\u2032\n\nk(n)\n\n\u03a6(n) (uJ,n ) = \u03a6(J) (uJ,J ) \u00d7 \"correcting terms\" (16)\n\nOn the left hand side of Eq. (15) we see that within our\nk(n)+1\nk(n)\nand the corlimited numerical resolution uJ,n , uJ,n\nreponding values of \u03bbn are almost identical whereas for\nthe righthand side this is not the case. By keeping track\nof the branch cuts we improve the precision inside the\nfjords dramatically. In other words, the large screening\ninside the fjords is simultaneously the problem and the\nsolution. The problem is that we\u2032 cannot use the standard approach in evaluating \u03a6(n) . The solution is that\nk(n)\nfor a point uJ,n inside the deepest fjords we always have\nthat J \u226a n and therefore the evaluation (15) helps to\nimprove the resolution.\nIn summary, the calculation is optimally accurate since\nwe avoid as much as possible the effects of the rapid\nshrinking of low probability regions on the unit circle.\nEach derivative in (15) is computed using information\nfrom a generation in which points on the unit circle are\noptimally resolved.\n\u221a The\nP integral (8) is then estimated as the finite sum\n\u03bb0 k(n) \u03bbqk(n) . We should stress that for clusters of the\norder of 30 000 particles we already compute, using this\nalgorithm, \u03bbk(n) values of the order of 10\u221270 . To find the\nequivalent small probabilities using random walks would\nrequire about 1035 attempts to see them just once. This\nis of course impossible, explaining the lasting confusion\nabout the issue of the phase transition in this problem.\nThis also means that all the f (\u03b1) curves that were computed before [15, 32] did not converge. Note that in our\ncalculation the small values of \u03bbk(n) are obtained from\nmultiplications rather than additions, and therefore can\nbe trusted.\nIII.\n\nMULTIFRACAL ANALYSIS OF THE\nHARMONINC MEASURE\n\nHaving the accurate values \u03bbk(n) we can now compute\nthe moments (7). Since the scaling form on the RHS\nincludes unknown coefficients, we compute the values of\n\u03c4 (q) by dividing h\u03bbqn i by h\u03bbqn\u0304 i, estimating\n\u03c4 (q) \u2248 \u2212D\n\nlog h\u03bbqn i \u2212 log h\u03bbn\u0304q i\nlog n \u2212 log n\u0304\n\n(17)\n\nResults for \u03c4 (q) for increasing values of n and n\u0304 are shown\nin Fig. 3, panel a. It is seen that the value of \u03c4 (q) appears\nto grow without bound for q negative. The existence of\na phase transition is however best indicated by measuring the derivatives of \u03c4 (q) with respect to q. In Fig. 3\npanel b we show the second derivative, indicating a phase\ntransition at a value of q that recedes away from q = 0\nwhen n increases. Due to the high accuracy of our measurement of \u03bb we can estimate already with clusters as\nsmall as 20-30 000 the q value of the phase transition as\nq \u2217 = \u22120.18 \u00b1 0.04. It is quite possible that larger clusters would have indicated slighly more negative values\nof q \u2217 , (and see below the results of different methods of\nestimates), but we believe that this value is close to convergence. The fact that this is so can be seen from the\n\n\f5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n\u03c4(q)\n-10\n\n-15\n\n-20\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\nq\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 4: The calculated function f (\u03b1) using \u03c4 (q) calculated\nfrom a cluster with n = 30 000 particles. This f (\u03b1) is almost\nindistinguishable from the one computed with n = 25000 particles. We propose that this function is well converged. The\nblack dot denotes where the curve ends, being tangent to the\nline with slope -0.18.\n\n0\n\n-50\n\n\u03c4''(q)\n\nIV.\n\n-100\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\nq\n\nFIG. 3: Panel a: the calculated function \u03c4 (q) for clusters of\nn particles, with n =10 000,15 000, 25 000 and 30 000. Panel\nb: the second derivative of \u03c4 (q) with respect to q.\n\nALTERNATIVE WAY TO APPROACH THE\nPHASE TRANSITION\n\nAn alternative way to the multifractal analysis is obtained by first reordering all the computed values of \u03bbk(n)\nin ascending order. In other words, we write them as a\nsequence {\u03bbn (i)}i\u2208I where I is an ordering of the indices\nsuch that \u03bbn (i) \u2264 \u03bbn (j) if i < j. The number of samples\nwe consider is usually large and therefore the discrete index i/N might be treated as a continuous index 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1\nand \u03bbn as a non-decreasing function of x,\n\u03bbn \u2261 f (x)\n\n(18)\n\nWe next consider the distribution of p(\u03bbn ), which is\ncalculated by the usual transformation formula\nZ\n1\n(19)\np(\u03bbn ) \u223c \u03b4(\u03bbn \u2212 f (x))dx = \u2032\n|f (x(\u03bbn ))|\nf (\u03b1) curve which is plotted in Fig. 4. A test of convergence is that the slope of this function where it becomes\nessentially linear must agree with the q value of the phase\ntransition. The straight line shown in Fig.3 has the slope\nof -0.18, and it indeed approximates very accurately the\nslope of the f (\u03b1) curve where it stops being analytic. The\nreader should also note that the peak of the curve agrees\nwith D \u2248 1.71, as well as the fact that \u03c4 (3) is also D as\nexpected in this problem. The value of \u03b1max is close to\n20, which is higher than anything predicted before. It is\nnevertheless finite. We believe that this function is well\nconverged, in contradistinction with past calculations.\n\nUsing the distribution of \u03bbn we now do the following\nrewritings,\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03bbqn d\u03b8 =\n\nZ\n\nL\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u223c\n\n0\n\n\u03bbqn\n\nd\u03b8\nds \u223c\nds\n\nq+ 12\n\n\u03bbn\n\nZ\n\nL\n\nq+ 21\n\n\u03bbn\n\nds\n\n(20)\n\n0\n\np(\u03bbn )d\u03bbn .\n\n(21)\n\n0\n\nIn Fig. 5 we will show that our function f (x) obeys a\npower law for low values of x,\nf (x) \u223c x\u03b2 ,\n\nfor x \u226a 1 .\n\n(22)\n\n\f6\n\n\u221240\n\u221280\n\n\u221260\n\nlog(\u03bb)\n\n\u221220\n\nV.\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\nlog(x)\nFIG. 5: Values of \u03bbn sorted in ascending order with respect\nto the variable x = i/N . This function is a pure power law\nfor values of log x smaller than the position of the circle. The\npower law is characterized by an exponent \u03b2 \u2248 8.55. This is\nconsistent with a phase transition for q \u2217 \u2248 \u2212.23\n\nThis in turn implies a power law dependence of p(\u03bbn ) on\n\u03bbn\np(\u03bbn ) \u223c\n\n1\n\n1\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\u0001\u03b2\u22121 \u223c \u03bbn ,\nx(\u03bbn )\n\nfor \u03bbn \u226a 1 .\n\n(23)\n\nThis power law tail means that the moment integral\n(21) diverges for values of q below a critical value qc given\nby,\nqc +\n\n1 1\u2212\u03b2\n+\n= \u22121\n2\n\u03b2\n\n(24)\n\nThus qc = \u2212 12 \u2212 \u03b21 . From (7) we see that the value of q \u2217\nsatisfied the relation\nq \u2217 = 2qc + 1 = \u22122/\u03b2 .\n\n(25)\n\nIn Fig. 5 we show how the values of \u03bbn depend on x for\nsmall values of x. The data is taken from a cluster with\nn = 20000. Denoting the value of \u03bbn that is marked as a\nfull circle by \u03bbc , the figure supports the existence of the\npower law (22) for values of \u03bbn smaller than \u03bbc . Needless\nto say this alos implies that p(\u03bbn ) scales according to\nEq.(23). By averaging over 16 clusters of size n=20000\nwe estimate the slope in Fig. 5 to be \u03b2 \u2248 8.55 or\nq \u2217 = \u22120.23 \u00b1 .05 .\n\n(26)\n\nObviously, this result is in agreement with our direct calculation in Sect. 3.\n\nGEOMETRICAL INTERPRETATION OF\nTHE PHASE TRANSITION\n\nAt this point we would like to interpret the origin of\nthe phase transition, which in light of the last section\nstems from the power law behavior of p(\u03bbn ) for small\nvalues of \u03bbn . We first identify the region on the cluster\nthat supports the low values of \u03bbn that belong to the\npower-law tail of p(\u03bbn ).\nConsider again Fig. 5. The point denoted above as\n\u03bbc defines the maximum value for which we see a power\nlaw in \u03bbn vs. x. Therefore the set responsible for the\nphase transition is the union of bumps with a value of\n\u03bbn for which \u03bbn < \u03bbc . This set is referred to below as\nthe \"critical set\", and is shown in figure 6, both on the\nbackground of the rest of the cluster, and as an isolated\nset. This figure suggests a geometric interpretation: the\nfjords in the figure all seem to have a characteristic angle.\nWe will try first to confirm this impression using careful\nnumerics.\nClearly, the set has several fjords; we consider them\nindividually. Fig. 7 shows an example of such a fjord.\nFor each fjord we find the point with the minimum probability and use this for defining the bottom (or deepest\npoint). Second, from the inside, we move to the two adjacent points which together with the deepest point define\nan angle. This angle is recorded, and we move to the\nnext pair of points, and so on until the value of \u03bbn exceeds \u03bbc . Fig.7 panel b shows how the angle varies with\nthe number of steps k. For most of the fjords considered\nthe angle is quite large for a small number of steps (up\nto 3-4 steps). As more steps are taken the angle settles\non a characteristic value around which it fluctuates. For\na larger number of steps we reach the outer parts of the\nfjord and the angle does no longer reflect the geometry\ninside the fjord. The dependence of the angle on k as\nshown in Fig. 7 is typical for all the fjords of the set\ncausing the phase transition and therefore we see a peak\nin the distribution of all the measured angles. This peak\nidentifies an angle which is characteristic to the fjords.\nFig. 8 is the distribution of such typical angles over one\ncluster. We determine the characteristic angle, say \u03b3c by\nlocating the maximum of the distribution. Finally, we\ncalculated the average of the charateristic angle \u03b3c over\n15 clusters of size n = 20000. On the basis of that we\ndetermine the angle to be\n\u03b3c = 35\u25e6 \u00b1 6\u25e6 .\n\n(27)\n\nFinally, we can offer a geometrical model to interpret\nthe phase transition. The results presented in this section indicate that to a reasonable approximation the least\naccessible fjords can be modeled as a wedge of included\nangle \u03b3c . In Appendix A we compute the power law expected for p(\u03bbn ) for a wedge. The final result is\n\u2212\n\n\u03b1\u22122\n\np(\u03bbn ) \u223c \u03bbn 2(\u03b1\u22121) ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere \u03b3c = \u03c0/\u03b1.

In panel a we show the set on the background of the cluster\nin grey, and in panel b the set isolated from the rest of the\ncluster.\n\nEq.(25) we predict finally q \u2217 = \u2212.24 \u00b1 .05. Obviously,\nthis is in excellent agreement with the previous findings.\nIn addition, we should comment on the interpretation\nof f (\u03b1max ) which is the value of the f (\u03b1) curve at the\npoint of loss of analyticity. Within the wedge model offered here, this must be the fractal dimension of the set\nof wedges that support the scaling law (28). We have\nattempted to determine this dimension numerically by\ncounting the number of fjords in the critical set shown in\nFig. (7) as a function of the number of paricles n in the\ncluster. While the result of such a calculation is consistent with the proposition, the available statistics is not\nsufficient to establish it firmly. We thus conclude with\nthe proposition as a conjecture, i.e. that f (\u03b1max ) can\nbe interpreted as the dimension of the set of fjords that\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nk\nFIG. 7: Panel a: A typical deep fjord resolved on the sacle of\nthe particles.

We have explained\nthat we must use the full power of the method in order to\novercome the strong contraction of the regions on the unit\ncircle that belong to the deep fjords. By iterating back\nand forth, using the fact that we own the history of the iteration scheme, we could resolve probabilities as small as\n10\u221235 .

In order to understand the loss\nof analyticity we offer a geometric picture. We identified\nthe critical set on the cluster as having harmonic probabilities that belong to the power law tail of p(\u03bbn ). Considering this set we identified fjords that can be modeled\nas wedges of characteristic angle. Taking such wedges\nas a model for the fjords of the critical set, we found a\nvalue of q \u2217 which is very close to the one computed using other methods. We thus propose that the point of\nnon-analyticity can be interpreted as resulting from the\npower-law dependence of the harmonic measure in the\nfjords belonging to the critical set.\n\nE(z) =\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been supported in part by the Petroleum\nResearch Fund, The European Commission under the\nTMR program and the Naftali and Anna BackenrothBronicki Fund for Research in Chaos and Complexity.\nA.

Since E\nis the same for the two rays of the wedge, it is sufficient\nto consider it only on the real axis. Starting from the\nuniform distribution of the \u03b8-values in mathematical\nspace, it follows:\n1 =\n\ndP (\u03b8)\ndP (E)\n=\nd\u03b8\ndE\n\ndP\ndE\ndP\n=\ndE\n=\n\n(A1)\n\n\u0001\nd\n1\n2\u03b1\nlog \u03c7\u22121 (z) =\n\u03b1\ndz\n|z| |z + z \u2212\u03b1 |\n\nOn the real axis close to the center z = 0, i.e.\nz = \u03c1 \u226a 1 it becomes\n\n2.\n\n\u00131/\u03b1\n\u0012\nw+1\n\u03c7(w) = i\nw\u22121\n\nas \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e\n\nThus the unit circle is unfolded onto the wedge; shifting\nthe point w = \u22121 to the origin z = 0; and rotating and\nstretching the upper half circle onto the real axis and the\nlower half circle to the other ray of the wedge \u03c1 ei\u03c0/\u03b1 .\nThe electric field follows from its definition:\n\n0\n0\n\n1.\n\nz\u03b1 + i\nz\u03b1 \u2212 i\n\nFrom here we see that \u03c7\u22121 (0) = \u22121 and\n\n10\n\nCounts\n\n30\n\n40\n\nmaps the outside of the unit circle to the inside of a\nwedge with opening angle \u03b3c = \u03c0/\u03b1, where \u03b1 \u2265 1 allows\n\u03b3c be vary between 0 and \u03c0.\nTo calculate the electric field E we need the inverse of \u03c7:\n\ndE\nd\u03c1\n\nd\u03c1\nd\u03b8\n\n\u0001\nd\ndE\n\u2212i log \u03a6\u22121 (\u03c1)\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c1\ndE\nE \u22121\nd\u03c1\n\n\u22121\n\n(A8)\n\n\f9\nor\n\nor\n\ndP (E) \u223c\n\ndE\n(\u03c1)\nd\u03c1\n\n\u22121\n\nE dE\n\n(A9)\ndP\n\nThe derivative of the electric field follows from (A5) or\n(A6)\ndE\n2\u03b1 |(\u03b1 + 1)\u03c1\u03b1 \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03c1\u2212\u03b1 |\n(\u03c1) =\n2\nd\u03c1\n\u03c1\n(\u03c1\u03b1 + \u03c1\u2212\u03b1 )\n\n(A10)\n\n\u0010p \u0011 p \u2212 1 p\n\u03b1\u22121\n\u03bbn \u223c \u03bbn\nd \u03bbn\n\n(A13)\n\nFor the probability density of \u03bbn this means\n\nYielding\n\u03b1\n\ndP (E) \u223c\n\n\u2212\u03b1\n\n\u03c1 (\u03c1 + \u03c1 )\ndE\n|(\u03b1 + 1)\u03c1\u03b1 \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03c1\u2212\u03b1 |\n\n(A11)\n\n\u2212\n\nFor small \u03c1 corresponding to a small field and thus small\n\u221a\n\u03bbn we get:\n1\n\ndP (E) \u223c \u03c1dE \u223c E \u03b1\u22121\n\n\u221a \u0001\n\u03bbn\ndP\nd\u03bbn\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndP (\u03bbn ) =\nd \u03bbn\n2 \u03bbn\n\n(A14)\n\n\u03b1\u22122\n\n\u223c \u03bbn 2(\u03b1\u22121) d\u03bbn\n\n(A15)\n\n(A12)\n\n[1] D.
