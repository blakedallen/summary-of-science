We present a comprehensive analysis of all available probes\nin minimal supergravity. This work extends previous analyses by including the focus point branch\nof parameter space and the full array of promising indirect dark matter searches. We find that\nparticle and astrophysical searches underway are highly complementary: each separately provides\nonly partial coverage of the available parameter space, but together they probe almost all models.\nCosmology does not provide upper bounds on superpartner masses useful for future colliders. At\nthe same time, in the cosmologically preferred region, if supersymmetry is to be observable at a 500\nGeV linear collider, some signature of supersymmetry must appear before the LHC.\n\nWeak-scale supersymmetry has consequences for a wide variety of particle physics experiments. At the same\ntime, it is now well-established that luminous matter makes up only a small fraction of the mass of the observed\nuniverse [1]. Neutralinos in supersymmetry are well-motivated candidates to provide much or all of the nonbaryonic dark matter. While it is conceivable that all standard model superpartners are unstable, decaying,\nfor example, into gravitinos or axinos, in many model frameworks, a neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (LSP) and stable. Further, neutralino thermal relic densities of the desired amount are remarkably\ngeneric in supergravity models [2]. If neutralinos make up a significant portion of the halo dark matter,\nastrophysical searches for dark matter open up many additional avenues for the discovery of supersymmetry.\nHere we summarize results of two studies of current and near future prospects for supersymmetry searches [3,\n4]. We consider minimal supergravity, a simple framework that is conservative in the sense that many low\nenergy signals generic in supersymmetry are suppressed. This work extends previous analyses in two ways.\nFirst, we include the focus point branch of supersymmetry parameter space [5], previously neglected. As we\nwill see, neutralino dark matter in the focus point region has novel properties, with strong, positive implications\nfor dark matter searches. Second, we consider not only collider experiments, low energy probes, and direct dark\nmatter searches, but also the full array of indirect dark matter searches. We find that the various searches are\nhighly complementary, and this comprehensive approach leads to strong conclusions that may be reached only\nby considering all available experiments.\nThe signals we consider, the projected sensitivities, and the experiments likely to achieve them, are listed\nin Table I. Conventional particle physics probes include searches at LEP and the Tevatron, the improved\nmeasurement of the the B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 branching ratio at B factories, as well as the projected final sensitivity of the\nBrookhaven g\u03bc \u2212 2 experiment. On the astrophysics side, we consider the projected reach of detectors searching\nfor direct dark matter interactions, including the CDMS [6], CRESST [7] and GENIUS [8] experiments.\nWe also include the most promising indirect dark matter searches. In the next five years, an astounding\narray of experiments will be sensitive to potential neutralino annihilation products. These include under-ice\nand underwater neutrino telescopes (AMANDA [9], NESTOR [10], ANTARES [11]), which will be sensitive to muons\nproduced by neutrinos from relic annihilations in the cores of the Sun and Earth [12]; atmospheric Cherenkov\ntelescopes (STACEE [13], CELESTE [14], ARGO-YBJ [15], MAGIC [16], HESS [17], CANGAROO [18], VERITAS [19]), and\nspace-based \u03b3 ray detectors (AGILE [20], AMS/\u03b3 [21], GLAST [22]), which may detect gamma rays from the galactic\ncenter [23]; and anti-matter/anti-particle experiments (PAMELA [24], AMS [25]), which may detect positrons [26],\nantiprotons [27] and antideuterium [28] from the galactic halo. In many cases, these experiments will improve\ncurrent sensitivities by several orders of magnitude. The search for supersymmetric dark matter is reviewed in\na number of excellent articles [29]; see also Refs. [30, 31, 32] and the bibliographies of Refs. [3, 4].\nThe main results from our combined study [4] of dark matter and collider signals in supersymmetry prior to\nthe start of the LHC are shown in Fig. 1. The regions of cosmologically interesting relic densities are shown;\nsee Ref. [3] for details. A generous range is 0.025 \u2264 \u03a9\u03c7 h2 \u2264 1, where the lower bound is the requirement that\nneutralino dark matter explain galactic rotation curves and the upper bound follows from the lifetime of the\n\n\u2217 jlf@mit.edu\n\u2020 Konstantin.Matchev@cern.ch\n\u2021 wilczek@mit.edu\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Estimated reaches of various high-energy collider and low-energy precision searches, direct dark matter searches,\nand indirect dark matter searches before the LHC begins operation, for tan \u03b2 = 10 (left) and tan \u03b2 = 50 (right). The\nprojected sensitivities used are given in Table I. The darker shaded (green) regions are excluded by the requirement\nthat the LSP be neutral (left) and by the LEP chargino mass limit (bottom and right). We have also delineated the\nregions with potentially interesting values of the LSP relic abundance: 0.025 \u2264 \u03a9\u03c7 h2 \u2264 1 (light-shaded, yellow) and\n0.1 \u2264 \u03a9\u03c7 h2 \u2264 0.3 (medium-shaded, light blue). The regions probed extend the curves toward the forbidden regions. The\ndark matter reaches are not modulated by the thermal relic density. Bounds from photons from the galactic center are\nhighly halo model-dependent; we assume a moderate halo profile parameter J \u0304 = 500 [33]. (From Ref. [4].)\n\nTABLE I: Constraints used in Fig. 1, and experiments likely to reach these sensitivities by 2006.\nObservable\n\u03c7\u0303+ \u03c7\u0303\u2212\n\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 \u03c7\u03030\nB \u2192 Xs \u03b3\nMuon MDM\n\u03c3proton\n\u03bd from Earth\n\u03bd from Sun\n\u03b3 (gal. center)\n\u03b3 (gal. center)\ne+ cosmic rays\n\nType\nCollider\nCollider\nLow energy\nLow energy\nDirect DM\nIndirect DM\nIndirect DM\nIndirect DM\nIndirect DM\nIndirect DM\n\nBound\nm\u00b1\n\u03c7\u0303 > 100 GeV\nfrom [34]\n|\u2206B(B \u2192 Xs \u03b3)| < 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124\n|aSUSY\n| < 8 \u00d7 10\u221210\n\u03bc\nfrom [35, 36]\n\u22122\n\u03a6\u2295\nyr\u22121\n\u03bc < 100 km\n\u2299\n\u22122\n\u03a6\u03bc < 100 km yr\u22121\n\u03a6\u03b3 (1) < 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm\u22122 s\u22121\n\u03a6\u03b3 (50) < 7 \u00d7 10\u221212 cm\u22122 s\u22121\n(S/B)max < 0.01\n\nExperiment(s)\nLEP: ALEPH, DELPHI, L3, OPAL\nTevatron: CDF, D\u00d8\nBaBar, BELLE\nBrookhaven E821\nCDMS, CRESST, GENIUS\nAMANDA,NESTOR,ANTARES\nAMANDA,NESTOR,ANTARES\nGLAST\nMAGIC\nAMS-02\n\nuniverse.

The range 0.1 \u2264 \u03a9\u03c7 h2 \u2264 0.3, preferred by\ncurrent limits, is also shown.\nSeveral striking conclusions follow from Fig. 1:\nNo Useful Upper Bounds from Cosmology. For all tan \u03b2, cosmologically interesting densities are possible\nfor either relatively small m0 , where the dark matter is Bino-like and coannihilation effects may be relevant [37],\nor in the focus point region at large m0 >\n\u223c 1 TeV, where the dark matter contains a small but phenomenologically significant Higgsino component. As is evident from Fig. 1, for all values of tan \u03b2, the cosmologically\npreferred region extends to very large m0 and M1/2 ; discovery at near future colliders cannot be guaranteed by\ncosmological arguments. The cosmologically preferred region is ultimately cutoff around M1/2 \u223c 6 TeV, but\nthis is far beyond the reach of the LHC and planned linear colliders.\nExcellent Prospects for Combined Searches. At the same time, by combining all available searches, nearly\nall of the cosmologically preferred models predict signals in at least one experiment. This is strictly true for\ntan \u03b2 = 10. For tan \u03b2 = 50, some of the preferred region escapes all probes, but this requires M1/2 >\n\u223c 450 GeV\n1.5\nTeV,\nand\nrequires\nsignificant\nfine-tuning\nof\nthe\nelectroweak\nscale.\nIn\nthe\nmost\nnatural\nregions,\nand m0 >\n\u223c\nall models with significant neutralino dark matter will yield some signal before the LHC begins operation.\nComplementarity of Particle and Astrophysical Searches. Also noteworthy is the complementarity of\ntraditional particle physics searches and indirect dark matter searches. Collider searches require, of course, light\nsuperpartners. High precision probes at low energy also require light superpartners, as the virtual effects of\nsuperpartners quickly decouple as they become heavy. Thus, the LEP and Tevatron reaches are confined to\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: As in Fig. 1, but in the (m0 , tan \u03b2) plane for fixed M1/2 = 400 GeV, A0 = 0, and \u03bc > 0. The regions probed are\ntoward the green regions, except for \u03a650\n\u03b3 , where it is between the two contours. The top excluded region is forbidden by\nlimits on the CP-odd Higgs scalar mass.\n\nthe lower left-hand corner, as are, to a lesser extent, the searches for deviations in B \u2192 Xs \u03b3 and a\u03bc . These\nbounds, and all others of this type, are easily satisfied in the focus point models with large m0 , and indeed\nthis is one of the virtues of these models. However, in the focus point models, all of the indirect searches are\nmaximally sensitive, as the dark matter contains a significant Higgsino component. Direct dark matter probes\nshare features with both traditional and indirect searches, and have sensitivity in both regions. It is only by\ncombining all of these experiments, that the preferred region may be explored completely.\nImplications for Linear Colliders. Finally, these results have implications for future colliders. In the\ncosmologically preferred regions of parameter space with 0.1 < \u03a9\u03c7 h2 < 0.3, all models with charginos or\nsleptons lighter than 300 GeV will produce observable signals in at least one experiment. This is evident for\ntan \u03b2 = 10 and 50 in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2, we vary tan \u03b2, fixing M1/2 to 400 GeV, which roughly corresponds to 300\nGeV charginos. We see that the preferred region is probed for any choice of tan \u03b2. (For extremely low tan \u03b2 and\nm0 , there appears to be a region that is not probed. However, this is excluded by current Higgs mass limits for\nA0 = 0. These limits might be evaded if A0 is also tuned to some extreme value, but in this case, top squark\nsearches in Run II of the Tevatron [38] will provide an additional constraint.) These results imply that if any\nsuperpartners are to be within reach of a 500 GeV lepton collider, some hint of supersymmetry must be seen\nbefore the LHC begins collecting data. This conclusion is independent of naturalness considerations.\nWhile our quantitative analysis is confined to minimal supergravity, we expect this result to be valid more\ngenerally. For moderate values of tan \u03b2, if the dark matter is made up of neutralinos, they must either be\nlight, Bino-like, or a gaugino-Higgsino mixture. If they are light, charginos are typically also light, and can be\ndiscovered at colliders. If the dark matter is Bino-like, light sfermions are required to mediate their annihilation,\nand there will be anomalies in low energy precision measurements. And if they are a gaugino-Higgsino mixture,\nat least one indirect dark matter search will see a signal. For large tan \u03b2, low energy probes become much more\neffective and again there is sensitivity to all superpartner spectra with light superpartners. These conclusions are\nnot airtight - they may be evaded by highly split charginos and neutralinos, highly split sfermions, or enhanced\nannihilation from Higgs poles. For example, in the case of highly split sfermions, one could arrange for light\nstaus to mediate neutralino annihilation, but very heavy smuons to suppress g\u03bc \u2212 2. Barring such possibilities,\nhowever, if supersymmetry exists at the weak scale and neutralinos provide the bulk of dark matter, there are\nexcellent prospects for supersymmetry discovery prior to LHC operation.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work of J.L.F. and F.W. was supported in part by the US Department of Energy under cooperative\nresearch agreement DF\u2013FC02\u201394ER40818.\n\n[1] J.
