Johnson\nDepartment of Mathematics and Statistics\nWilliams College\nNovember 9, 2018\n\nAbstract\nGenerically, every fixed point for the differential inclusion x\u2032 \u2208 Convex Hull{f1 (x), f2 (x)}\ncan be approximated by an arbitrarily small two-cycle for the inclusion\nx\u2032 \u2208 {f1 (x), f2 (x)}, where f1 , f2 are a C 1 flows on Rn .\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nTwo-Flows, Stasis Points and Two-Cycles\n\nConsider a controlled system that switches freely between two autonomous flows\nx\u2032 = f1 (x) and x\u2032 = f2 (x) where x \u2208 Rn and fi : Rn \u2192 Rn is C 1 . This is the\ndifferential inclusion\nx\u2032 \u2208 {f1 (x), f2 (x)}.\nTrajectories are piecewise C 1 functions x(t) satisfying this inclusion.\nA stasis point is a point x at where the flows are anti-parallel:\nf1 (x) * f2 (x) = \u2212|f1 (x)| * |f2 (x)|.\nThe set of stasis points is the set of possible fixed points for the relaxed differential inclusion\nx\u2032 \u2208 Convex Hull({f1 (x), f2 (x)}).\nA two-cycle x(t) is a periodic trajectory x(t) = x(\u03b4 + t) with 0 < \u03ba < \u03b4 and\nx\u2032 = f1 (x)\nand x\u2032 = f2 (x)\n\nfor 0 \u2264 t < \u03ba\nfor \u03ba \u2264 t < \u03b4\n\nIt will be shown that neighborhoods of stasis points generically contain twocycles.\n\n2\n\nLoops in the Action\n\nAn C 2 action of R on Rn is a map \u03a6 : Rn \u00d7 R \u2192 Rn which is C 2 in all\nvariables. A loop is a point and time x0 , t0 with \u03a6(x0 , t0 ) = \u03a6(x0 , t0 + \u03b4) for\nsome \u03b4 > 0.\n\u2202\nA point x0 is stationary at time t0 if \u2202t\n\u03a6(x0 , t0 ) = ~0. Note that a point that\n\u2202\n\u03a6(x0 , t) \u2261 ~0 for \u03b1 < t < \u03b2, is\nremains stationary for some open time interval, \u2202t\na (degenerate) loop of all sufficiently small periods.\n\nThe following theorem states that actions with stationary points generically\nhave small loops nearby.\nTheorem 1 Let \u03a6 : Rn \u00d7 R \u2192 Rn be a C 2 action. Suppose \u2203x0 , t0 with\n\u2202\n~\n\u2202t \u03a6(x0 , t0 ) = 0. If\n\u22022\n\u03a6(x0 , t0 )\n\u2202x\u2202t\n\n2\n\n\fis non-singular then \u2200\u01eb, \u2203z0 , \u03c40 , \u03b4 > 0 with \u03a6(z0 , \u03c40 ) = \u03a6(z0 , \u03c40 + \u03b4) and\n|\u03a6(z0 , t) \u2212 \u03a6(x0 , t0 )| < \u01eb\nfor \u03c40 \u2264 t < \u03c40 + \u03b4.\nProof:\nWithout loss of generality we take x0 = ~0 and t0 = 0.\nLet\nG(x, \u03b4) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\n1\n2\u03b4\n\n(\u03a6(x, \u03b4) \u2212 \u03a6(x, \u2212\u03b4))\n\u2202\n\u2202t \u03a6(x, 0)\n\nif\n\n\u03b4 6= 0\n\nif\n\n\u03b4=0\n\n\u22022\u03a6 ~\n~\nSo G is C 1 at x = ~0, \u03b4 = 0, and \u2202G\n\u2202x (0, 0) = \u2202x\u2202t (0, 0) is non-singular by assumption. Therefore the Implicit Function Theorem applies, and since G(~0, 0) = ~0\nthere exist solutions x to G(x, \u03b4) = ~0 for \u03b4 sufficiently small.\n\nFor \u03b4 6= 0, a point x with G(x, \u03b4) = ~0 has \u03a6(x0 , \u03b4) = \u03a6(x0 , \u2212\u03b4), which is a loop.\n\n3\n\nTwo-Cycle Approximation to Stasis\n\nIt is known that relaxed solutions to differential inclusions can be arbitrarily\napproximated by non-relaxed solutions [1, 2]. Here it is shown that in the case\nof autonomous two-flows and relaxed fixed points, the approximating trajectory\ncan be taken as a two-cycle. For flows f1 , f2 , the idea is to take Rn modulo the\ntrajectories of f1 , and consider the remaining (non-autonomous) action of f2 on\nRn\u22121 . Loops in this resulting action will pull back to two-cycles in the original\nsystem.\nTheorem 2 Consider two C 1 flows f1 , f2 : Rn \u2192 Rn , and a stasis point x0\nd\n(k1 f1 + k2 f2 ) is non-singular at x0 ,\nwith k1 f1 (x0 ) + k2 f2 (x0 ) = ~0, ki > 0. If dx\nthen there exist two-cycles near x0 .\nProof: Without loss of generality we take x0 = ~0. Since f1 is C 1 and non-zero\nd\u03c1\n*f1 \u2261 (1, 0, . . . , 0)\nat near ~0, there is a local diffeomorphism \u03c1 : Rn \u2192 Rn with dx\nd\u03c1\nk1\n\u22121\n1\n~\n~\nnear 0. Then g2 = dx * f2 \u25e6 \u03c1 is a C flow with g2 (0) = (\u2212 k2 , 0, . . . , 0).\nWe construct the Rn\u22121 action \u03a6 as follows: given y = (a1 , . . . , an\u22121 ) \u2208 Rn\u22121\nlet x(t) = (x1 (t), . . . , xn (t)) be the trajectory under the flow g2 with x(0) =\n3\n\n\f(0, a1 , . . . , an\u22121 ) \u2208 Rn . Taking \u03a6(y, t) = (x2 (t), . . . , xn (t)) defines a C 2 action\n\u2202\non Rn\u22121 with \u2202t\n\u03a6(~0, 0) = ~0. It is straightforward to check that non-singularity\n\u22022\nd\n\u03a6 at (~0, 0) \u2208 Rn\u22121 \u00d7 R.\nof dx (\u03b1f1 + \u03b2f2 ) at ~0 \u2208 Rn implies that of \u2202x\u2202t\nBy Theorem 1, for all \u01eb > 0 there exist z = (z1 , . . . , zn\u22121 ) near ~0 \u2208 Rn\u22121 with\n\u03a6(z, \u03b1) = \u03a6(z, \u03b2) for some |\u03b1|, |\u03b2| < \u01eb, \u03b1 6= \u03b2. This corresponds to a trajectory\nx(t) in under g2 on Rn with x(0) = (0, z1 , . . . , zn\u22121 ). Now x(\u03b1) and x(\u03b2) are\nequal except for their first coordinate, which cannot be zero for sufficiently small\n\u01eb because g2 is non-zero near ~0. Thus x(\u03b1) \u2212 x(\u03b2) is parallel to the constant\nflow g1 and connecting these points with a segment of the g1 flow completes the\ntwo-cycle. This maps to a two-cycle for f1 and f2 under \u03c1\u22121 .\n\n4\n\nThree Questions\n\nFor R2 , every two cycle contains a stasis point [3]. Is a similar statement true\nfor Rn ?\nGiven a pair of flows f1 , f2 , the stasis points generically form one dimensional\ncurves. For n = 2, an approximating two cycle will cut across this curve twice,\nand so the set of approximating two-cycles is parameterized by pairs of nearby\npoints on the stasis curve [3]. Is there a similar organization of two-cycles in\nRn ?\nFinally, a natural question is to extend this to N -flows. That is, for a differential inclusion x\u2032 \u2208 {f1 (x), f2 (x), f3 (x)}, can a relaxed fixed point always be\napproximated by a three-cycle?\n\nReferences\n[1] A. F.
