Many observables have been devised which provide a convenient way of characterizing the main features of such events. Multijet event rates are\npredicted in perturbation theory as functions of the jet-resolution parameter, with one\nfree parameter, the strong coupling \u03b1S . Events with four quarks in the final state, qq\u0304qq\u0304,\nor two quarks and two gluons, qq\u0304gg, may lead to events with four-jet structure. In leading\norder perturbation theory, the rate of four-jet events in e+ e\u2212 annihilation is predicted to\nbe proportional to \u03b1S2 . The strong coupling can be measured by determining the four-jet\nevent production rate and fitting the theoretical prediction to the data.\nCalculations beyond leading order are made possible by theoretical progress achieved during the last few years. For multi-jet rates as well as numerous event-shape distributions\nwith perturbative expansions starting at O(\u03b1S ), matched next-to-leading order (NLO)\nand next-to-leading logarithmic approximations (NLLA) provide a satisfactory description of the data over large kinematically allowed regions at many centre-of-mass energies\n[2\u20135].\nFirst evidence for four-jet structure has been reported earlier by the JADE collaboration [6]. In addition multi-jet event production rates were measured and the three-jet\nrate was used to determine the the strong coupling \u03b1S [7\u20139]. The ALEPH, DELPHI and\nOPAL collaborations published measurements of \u03b1S based on the four-jet rate in the energy range between 91 and 209 GeV [10\u201312]. The same theoretical predictions as used\nhere were employed to determine the strong coupling \u03b1S .\nIn this analysis we use data collected by the JADE experiment in the years 1979 to 1986\nat the PETRA e+ e\u2212 collider at DESY at six centre-of-mass energies spanning the range\nof 14\u201344 GeV.\n\n2\n\nObservable\n\nJet algorithms are applied to cluster the large number of particles of a hadronic event into\na small number of jets, reflecting the parton structure of the event. For this analysis we\nuse the Durham scheme [2]. Defining each particle initially to be a proto-jet, a resolution\nvariable yij is calculated for each pair of proto-jets i and j:\nyij =\n\n2min(Ei2 , Ej2 )\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8ij ),\n2\nEvis\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ei and Ej are the energies of jets i and j, cos \u03b8ij is the cosine of the angle between\nthem and Evis is the sum of the energies of the detected particles in the event (or the\npartons in a theoretical calculation). If the smallest value of yij is less than a predefined\nvalue ycut , the pair is replaced by a new proto-jet with four-momentum p\u03bck = p\u03bci + p\u03bcj , and\nthe clustering starts again. Clustering ends when the smallest value of yij is larger than\nycut , and the remaining proto-jets are accepted and counted as finally selected jets.\nThe next-to-leading order QCD calculation predicts the four-jet rate R4 , which is the\n2\n\n\ffraction of four-jet events as a function of \u03b1S . It can be written in the following way [5]:\nR4 (ycut ) =\n\n\u03c34-jet (ycut )\n= \u03b7 2 B4 (ycut ) + \u03b7 3 [C4 (ycut ) + 3/2(\u03b20 log x\u03bc \u2212 1) B4 (ycut )]\n\u03c3tot\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c34-jet (ycut ) is the cross-section for the production of hadronic events with four jets at\nfixed ycut , \u03c3tot the total hadronic cross-section, \u03b7 =\u221a\u03b1S CF /2\u03c0 with CF = 4/3 the colour\nfactor \u221a\nfrom the SU(3) symmetry group, x\u03bc = \u03bc/ s with \u03bc being the renormalization\nscale, s the centre-of-mass energy, and \u03b20 = (11 \u2212 2nf /3) with nf the number of active\nflavours2 . The coefficients B4 and C4 are obtained by integrating the massless matrix\nelements for e+ e\u2212 annihilation into four- and five-parton final states, calculated by the\nprogram DEBRECEN 2.0 [5].\nEq. (2) is used to predict the four-jet rate as a function of ycut . The fixed-order perturbative prediction is not reliable for small values of ycut , due to terms of the form \u03b1Sn lnm (ycut )\nwhich enhance the higher order corrections. An all-order resummation of such terms in\nthe NLLA is possible for the Durham clustering algorithm [2]. The NLLA calculation is\ncombined with the NLO-prediction using the so-called modified R-matching scheme [13].\nIn the modified R-matching scheme the terms proportional to \u03b7 2 and \u03b7 3 are removed from\nthe NLLA prediction RNLLA and the difference is then added to the NLO calculation RNLO\nwith the result:\nRR\u2212match = RNLLA + [\u03b7 2 (B4 \u2212 B NLLA ) + \u03b7 3 (C4 \u2212 C NLLA \u2212 3/2(B4 \u2212 B NLLA ))],\n\n(3)\n\nwhere B NLLA and C NLLA are the coefficients of the expansion of RNLLA as in Eq. (2) and\nthe x\u03bc term and ycut dependence have been suppressed for clarity.\n\n3\n\nAnalysis Procedure\n\n3.1\n\nThe JADE Detector\n\nA detailed description of the JADE detector can be found in [1]. This analysis relies\nmainly on the reconstruction of charged particle trajectories and on the measurement of\nenergy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Tracking of charged particles was\nperformed with the central tracking detector, which was positioned in a solenoidal magnet\nproviding an axial magnetic field of 0.48 T. The central detector contained a large volume\njet chamber. Later a vertex chamber close to the interaction point and surrounding zchambers to measure the z-coordinate 3 were added. Most of the tracking information is\nobtained from the jet chamber, which provides up to 48 measured space points per track,\nand good tracking efficiency in the region | cos \u03b8| < 0.97. Electromagnetic showers are\nmeasured by the lead glass calorimeter surrounding the magnet coil, separated into a barrel\n2\n\nIn this analysis the number of active flavours is set to five.\nIn the JADE right-handed coordinate system the +x axis points towards the centre of the PETRA\nring, the y axis pointed upwards and the z axis points in the direction of the positron beam. The polar\nangle \u03b8 and the azimuthal angle \u03c6 are defined with respect to z and x, respectively, while r is the distance\nfrom the z-axis.\n3\n\n3\n\n\f(| cos \u03b8| < 0.839) and two end-cap (0.86 < | cos \u03b8| < 0.97) sections. The electromagnetic\ncalorimeter consisted of 2520 lead glass blocks with a depth of 12.5 radiation lengths in\nthe barrel (since 1983 increased to 15.7 in the middle 20% of the barrel) and 192 lead\nglass blocks with 9.6 radiation lengths in the end-caps.\n\n3.2\n\nData Samples\n\nThe data used in this analysis were collected by JADE between 1979 and 1986 and correspond to a total integrated luminosity of 195 pb\u22121 . The breakdown of the data samples,\naverage centre-of-mass energy, energy range, data taking period, collected integrated luminosities and the size of the data samples after selection of hadronic events are given in\ntable 1. The data samples are chosen following previous analyses, e.g. [1, 9, 14\u201316] 4 .\naverage\nenergy\nyear luminosity selected\nenergy in GeV range in GeV\n(pb\u22121 )\nevents\n14.0\n13.0\u201315.0\n1981\n1.46\n1783\n22.0\n21.0\u201323.0\n1981\n2.41\n1403\n34.6\n33.8\u201336.0 1981\u20131982\n61.7\n14313\n35.0\n34.0\u201336.0\n1986\n92.3\n20876\n38.3\n37.3\u201339.3\n1985\n8.28\n1585\n43.8\n43.4\u201346.4 1984\u20131985\n28.8\n4374\nTable 1: The average centre-of-mass energy, the energy range, the year of data taking\nand the integrated luminosity for each data sample, together with the numbers of selected\ndata events.\n\n3.3\n\nMonte Carlo Samples\n\nSamples of Monte Carlo simulated events are used to correct the data for experimental\nacceptance, resolution and backgrounds. The process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons is simulated using\nPYTHIA 5.7 [17]. Corresponding samples using HERWIG 5.9 [18] are used for systematic\nchecks. The Monte Carlo samples generated at each energy point are processed through a\nfull simulation of the JADE detector [19\u201322], and reconstructed in essentially the same way\nas the data. In addition, for comparisons with the corrected data, and when correcting\nfor the effects of hadronization, large samples of Monte Carlo events without detector\nsimulation are employed, using the parton shower models PYTHIA 6.158, HERWIG 6.2\nand ARIADNE 4.11 [23]. Each of these hadronization models contains a number of\ntunable\nparameters; these were adjusted by tuning to previously published OPAL data\n\u221a\nat s \u223c 91 GeV as summarized in [24] for PYTHIA/JETSET and in [25] for HERWIG\nand ARIADNE. The data taken by the JADE experiment are well described by the Monte\n4\n\nThe data are available from two versions of the reconstruction software from 9/87 and from 5/88. We\nuse the set from 5/88 as the default version and consider differences between the results as an experimental\nsystematic uncertainty.\n\n4\n\n\fCarlo simulated events [16], with only the centre-of-mass energy changed and set to the\nrespective value of the event.\n\n3.4\n\nSelection of Events\n\nThe selection of events for this analysis aims to identify hadronic event candidates and\nto reject events with a large amount of energy emitted by initial state photon radiation\n(ISR). The selection of hadronic events is based on cuts on event multiplicity to remove\nleptonic final states and on visible energy and longitudinal momentum imbalance to remove radiative and two-photon events, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 + hadrons. The cuts are documented\nin [8, 26, 27] and summarized in a previous publication [14]:\nStandard criteria are used to select good tracks and clusters of energy deposits in the\ncalorimeter for subsequent analysis. For charged particle tracks the pion mass was assigned while for clusters zero mass particles are assumed. Charged particle tracks are\nrequired to have at least 20 hits in r \u2212 \u03c6 and at least 12 hits in r \u2212 z in the jet chamber.\nThe total momentum is required to be at least 100 MeV. Furthermore, the point of closest approach of the track to the collision axis is required to be less than 5 cm from the\nnominal collision point in the x \u2212 y plane and less than 35 cm in the z\u2212direction.\nIn order to mitigate the effects of double counting of energy from tracks and calorimeter\nclusters a standard algorithm is adopted which associates charged particles with calorimeter clusters, and subtracts the estimated contribution of the charged particles from the\ncluster energy. Clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter are required to have an energy\nexceeding 0.15 GeV after the subtraction of the expected energy deposit of associated\nP\ntracks. From all accepted tracks and clusters the visible energy Evis = i Ei , momentum\nP\nP\nbalance pbal = | i pz,i |/Evis and missing momentum pmiss = | i ~pi | are calculated.\nHadronic event candidates are required to pass the following selection criteria:\n\u2022 The total energy\n\u221a deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter\n\u221a has to exceed 1.2 GeV\n(0.2 GeV) for \u221as < 16 GeV, 2.0 GeV (0.4 GeV) for 16 < s < 24 GeV and 3.0 GeV\n(0.4 GeV) for s > 24 GeV in the barrel (each endcap) of the detector.\n\u2022 Events with exactly four tracks with configurations where three tracks are in one\nhemisphere and one track is in the opposite hemisphere are rejected.\n\u2022 At least three tracks have to have more than 24 hits in r \u2212 \u03c6 and a momentum in\nthe x \u2212 y plane larger than 500 MeV; these tracks are called long tracks.\n\u221a\n\u2022 The visible energy has to fulfill Evis / s > 0.5.\n\u2022 The momentum balance has to fulfill pbal < 0.4.\n\u221a\n\u2022 The missing momentum has to fulfill pmiss / s < 0.3.\n\u2022 The z-coordinate of the reconstructed event vertex has to lie within 15 cm of the\ninteraction point.\n\u2022 The polar angle of the event thrust axis [28] is required to satisfy | cos(\u03b8T )| < 0.8 in\norder that the events be well contained within the detector acceptance.\n5\n\n\f\u2022 The number of good charged particle tracks is required to be greater than three\nreducing \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 and two-photon backgrounds to a negligible level.\nThe numbers of selected events for each centre-of-mass energy are shown in table 1.\n\n3.5\n\nCorrections to the data\n\nAll selected tracks and electromagnetic calorimeter clusters are used in the evaluation of\nthe four-jet rate. The four-jet rate distribution as a function of the jet resolution ycut\nafter all selection cuts applied is called the detector-level distribution.\nIn this analysis events from the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 bb\u0304 systematically bias our results,\nsince especially at low centre-of-mass energies the large mass of the b quarks and of\nthe subsequently produced and decaying B hadrons will influence the four-jet rate distribution [10\u201312]. The QCD predictions are calculated for massless quarks and thus we\nchoose to correct our data for the presence of bb\u0304 events. About 1/11 of all qq\u0304 events\nare bb\u0304 events. The expected number of bb\u0304 background events \u03b7i is subtracted from the\nobserved number of data events Ni at each ycut bin i. The effects of detector acceptance\nand resolution and of residual ISR are then accounted for by a multiplicative correction\nprocedure.\nTwo distributions are formed from Monte Carlo simulated signal events; the first, at the\ndetector-level, treats the Monte Carlo events identically to the data, while the second, at\nthe hadron-level, is computed\u221ausing the true four-momenta of the stable particles5 , and\nis restricted\nto events where s\u2032 , the centre-of-mass energy reduced due to ISR, satisfies\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns\u2212 s\u2032 < 0.15 GeV. The ratio of the Monte Carlo distribution taken at the hadron-level\nto the distribution taken at the detector-level for each ycut bin i, Cidetector , is used as a\ncorrection factor for the data. This finally yields the corrected number of four jet events\nat ycut bin i, \u00d1i = Cidetector * (Ni \u2212 \u03b7i ). The hadron-level distribution is then normalized at\neach ycut bin i by calculating R4,i = \u00d1i /N, where the N is the corrected number of events\nselected at hadron-level. We observe some disagreement between the detector corrections\n\u221a\ncalculated using PYTHIA or HERWIG at low centre-of-mass energies while at larger s\nthe correction factors agree well within the regions chosen for comparison with the theory predictions. The difference in detector corrections is evaluated as an experimental\nsystematic uncertainty. The numerical results of the four-jet rate at hadron-level at the\ndifferent energy points are summarized in Tables 5 and 6.\n\n4\n\nSystematic Uncertainties\n\nSeveral sources of possible systematic uncertainties are studied. Uncertainties originating\nfrom massless quark calculations are not considered, since contributions to the four-jet\nrate from B hadrons are subtracted at detector-level. For each variation of parameters\nthe difference of the resulting value of \u03b1S with respect to the default value is taken as a\nsystematic uncertainty. The default value of \u03b1S is determined with the standard event\n5\n\nAll charged and neutral particles with a lifetime longer than 3 \u00d7 10\u221210 s are treated as stable.\n\n6\n\n\fselection and the correction procedure using PYTHIA. The systematic uncertainty is\ntaken to be symmetric around the default value of \u03b1S .\n\n4.1\n\nExperimental uncertainties:\n\nContributions to the experimental uncertainties are estimated by repeating the analysis\nwith varied cuts or procedures. For each systematic variation the value of \u03b1S is determined\nand then compared to the result of the standard analysis (default value).\n1. In the standard analysis the reconstruction software from 5/88 is used. As a variation a different reconstruction software from 9/87 is used.\n2. In the default method the estimated minimum ionizing energy from tracks associated\nwith electromagnetic calorimeter clusters is subtracted from the cluster energies. As\na variation all accepted tracks and all uncorrected electromagnetic clusters are used.\n3. The thrust axis is required to satisfy | cos(\u03b8T )| < 0.7. With this more stringent\ncut events are restricted to the barrel region of the detector, which provides better\nmeasurements of tracks and clusters compared to the endcap regions.\n4. Instead of using PYTHIA for the correction of detector effects as described in section 3.5, events generated with HERWIG are used.\n\u221a\n5. The requirement on missing momentum is dropped or tightened to pmiss / s < 0.25.\nThe larger deviation from the default value is taken as a systematic uncertainty.\n6. The requirement on the momentum balance is dropped or tightened to pbal < 0.3.\nThe larger deviation from the default value is taken as a systematic uncertainty.\n7. The requirement on the number of long tracks is tightened to Nlong \u2265 4.\n\u221a\n\u221a\n8. The requirement on the visible energy is varied to Evis / s > 0.45 and Evis / s >\n0.55. The larger deviation from the default value is taken as a systematic uncertainty.\n9. The fit range is changed. Two different cases are considered. First the fit range is\nreduced by one data point at each edge of the standard fit range. Second the fit\nrange is extended by one data point at each edge of the standard fit range. The\nlarger deviation from the default fit is taken as a systematic uncertainty. In order\nto take statistical fluctuations into account, the deviation is calculated using the\naverage deviation of a fit applied to 50 Monte Carlo samples.\n10. The amount of subtracted bb\u0304 background is varied by \u00b15% of its nominal value of\nabout 1/11 to cover uncertainties in the estimation of the background fraction in\nthe data. The larger deviation from the default value is taken as the systematic\nuncertainty.\nAll contributions listed above are added in quadrature and the result is quoted as the\nexperimental systematic uncertainty. The dominating effects are the use of the different\ndata versions and the different correction for detector effects.\n7\n\n\f4.2\n\nHadronization:\n\nThe uncertainties associated with the hadronization correction (see section 5.2) are assessed by using HERWIG and ARIADNE instead of the default hadronization correction\nusing PYTHIA. The larger change in \u03b1S resulting from these alternatives is taken to define\nthe symmetric hadronization systematic uncertainty.\n\n4.3\n\nTheoretical Uncertainties:\n\nThe theoretical uncertainty, associated with missing higher order terms in the theoretical\nprediction, is assessed by varying the renormalization scale factor x\u03bc . The predictions of\na complete QCD calculation would be independent of x\u03bc , but a finite-order calculation\nsuch as that used here retains some dependence on x\u03bc . The renormalization scale factor\nx\u03bc is set to 0.5 and one. The larger deviation from the default value of \u03b1S is taken as\nsystematic uncertainty.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nResults\nFour-Jet Rate Distributions\n\nThe four-jet rates for the six centre-of-mass energy points after subtraction of bb\u0304 background and correction for detector effects are shown in figures 1 and 2. Superimposed\nare the distributions predicted by the PYTHIA, HERWIG and ARIADNE Monte Carlo\nmodels. Towards large ycut values (right to the maximum of the distribution) the decrease\nof the four-jet rate corresponds to the migration and classification to three- and two-jet\nevents. Towards smaller ycut values (left to the maximum of the distribution) the decrease\ncorresponds to the migration and classification to five or more jet events, i.e. towards the\nhigher order QCD and non-perturbative or hadronization region. In order to make a\nmore clear comparison between data and models, the inserts in the upper right corner\nshow the differences between data and each model, divided by the combined statistical\nand experimental error at that point. The sum of squares of these differences would, in\nthe absence of point-to-point correlations, represent a \u03c72 between data and the model.\nHowever, since correlations are present, such \u03c72 values should be regarded only as a rough\nindication of the agreement between data and the models. The three models are seen to\ndescribe the data well.\n\n5.2\n\nDetermination of \u03b1S\n\nOur measurement of the strong coupling \u03b1S is based on \u03c72 fits of QCD predictions to\nthe corrected four-jet rate distribution, i.e. the data shown in figures 1 and 2. The\ntheoretical predictions of the four-jet rate using the combined O(\u03b1S3 )+NLLA calculation\nas described in section 2 provide distributions at the parton-level. In the Monte Carlo\nsimulation the parton-level distributions are obtained from the partons after the parton\nshower has stopped, just before the hadronization. In order to confront the theory with\nthe hadron-level data, it is necessary to correct for hadronization effects. This is done by\n8\n\n\fcalculating the distributions at both the hadron and the parton-level using PYTHIA and,\nas a cross-check, with the HERWIG and ARIADNE models. The theoretical prediction\nis then multiplied by the ratio of the hadron- and parton-level distributions.\nThe differences between the models are considered as a systematic uncertainty.\nA \u03c72 -value at each energy point is calculated using the following formula:\n\u03c72 =\n\nn\nX\ni,j\n\n\u22121\ntheo\n(R4,i \u2212 R(\u03b1S )theo\n4,i )(V (R4 ) )ij (R4,j \u2212 R(\u03b1S )4,j )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the indices i and j denote the ycut bins in the chosen fit range and the R(\u03b1S )theo\n4,i\nare the predicted values of the four-jet rate. The four-jet rate as a function of ycut is an\nintegrated distribution and therefore a single event can contribute to several ycut bins and\nneighboring ycut bins are correlated. The covariance matrix Vij is calculated using the\nmatrix Wij determined from four-jet rate distributions calculated from Monte-Carlo at\nthe hadron-level as follows:\nn\nn\nn\nX\nX\n1\n1X\nWij =\nxki xkj \u2212\nxki\nxk ,\nn \u2212 1 k=1\nn k=1 k=1 j\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(5)\n\nwhere xki is the average jet rate for a given ycut bin i and sample k, and n is the number\nof subsamples. Subsamples are built by choosing 1000 events randomly out of the set\nof all generated Monte Carlo events. A single event may be included in several subsamples, but the impact on the final covariance matrix is expected to be very small and,\ntherefore, is neglected [29]. For every centre-of-mass energy point 1000 subsamples are\nbuilt. The \u221a\nmatrix Wij is then used to determine the correlation matrix, \u03c1ij = Wij /\u03c3\u0303i \u03c3 \u0303j ,\nwith \u03c3\u0303i = Wii . The covariance matrix Vij (R4 ) used in the \u03c72 fit is then determined\nusing the statistical error \u03c3i of the data sample at data point i and the correlation matrix\n\u03c1ij : Vij (R4 ) = \u03c1ij \u03c3i \u03c3j .\nThe \u03c72 value is minimized with respect to \u03b1S for each centre-of-mass energy point separately. The renormalization scale factor x\u03bc , as discussed in section 2, is set to one.\nThe fit ranges are determined by requiring that the hadronization corrections be less than\n50% and the detector corrections be less than 50% in the fit range. In order to exclude\n\u221a\nthe non-perturbative region we require s * ycut to be larger than 2 GeV. In the Durham\nscheme this value corresponds to the minimal transverse momentum of the pair of protojets with respect to each other. The fit range is 0.0209 < ycut < 0.0495 for data taken\nat 14 GeV, 0.0088 < ycut < 0.0495 for data taken at 22 GeV, 0.0037 < ycut < 0.0279 for\ndata taken at 34.6 and 35 GeV, 0.0028 < ycut < 0.0279 for data taken at 38.3 GeV and\n0.0021 < ycut < 0.0279 for data taken at 43.8 GeV. In figures 3 and 4 the hadron-level\nfour-jet distributions with the fit results for the six energy points are shown together with\nthe four-jet rate prediction with \u03b1S being the current world average. The results of the\nfits are summarized in Table 2. The statistical uncertainties correspond to the uncertainty from the \u03c72 minimization, while the systematic errors are determined as described\nin section 4.\nIt is of interest to combine the measurements of \u03b1S from the different centre-of-mass\nenergy points in order to determine a single value of \u03b1S at a common energy scale. The\nfit results for \u03b1S are combined using the procedure of Ref. [30]. In brief the method is as\n9\n\n\f\u221a\n\ns [GeV]\n14.00\n22.00\n34.60\n35.00\n38.30\n43.80\n\n\u221a\n\u03b1S ( s)\n0.1536\n0.1407\n0.1346\n0.1391\n0.1355\n0.1289\n\nstat.\n0.0032\n0.0028\n0.0007\n0.0006\n0.0021\n0.0012\n\nexp.\n0.0064\n0.0034\n0.0019\n0.0017\n0.0042\n0.0011\n\nscale \u03c72 /d.o.f.\n0.0074\n1.46/3\n0.0024 14.22/6\n0.0011 17.20/7\n0.0012 23.51/7\n0.0020 19.78/8\n0.0019\n4.02/9\n\nhadr.\n0.0028\n0.0021\n0.0031\n0.0033\n0.0038\n0.0038\n\nTable 2: The value of \u03b1S for each energy point and the statistical, experimental, hadronization and scale errors.

The set of \u03b1S measurements to be combined are first evolved to a common scale,\nQ = MZ0 , assuming the validity of QCD and MZ0 being the mass of the Z0 vector boson.\nThe measurements are then combined in a weighted mean, to minimize the \u03c72 between\nthe combined value and the measurements. If the measured values evolved to Q = MZ0\nare denoted \u03b1S,i , with covariance matrix V \u2032 , the combined value, \u03b1S (MZ0 ), is given by\n\u03b1S (M ) =\nZ0\n\nX\n\nwi \u03b1S,i\n\nwhere\n\n)ij\n,\n\u2032 \u22121 )\njk\nj,k (V\n\nP\n\nwi = P\n\nj (V\n\n\u2032 \u22121\n\n(6)\n\nwhere i and j denote the six individual results. The difficulty resides in making a reliable estimate of V \u2032 in the presence of dominant and highly correlated systematic errors.\nSmall uncertainties in the estimation of these correlations can cause undesirable features\nsuch as negative weights. For this reason only experimental systematic errors assumed\nto be partially correlated between measurements contribute to the off-diagonal elements\n2\n2\nof the covariance matrix: Vij\u2032 = min(\u03c3exp,i\n, \u03c3exp,j\n). All error contributions (statistical,\nexperimental, hadronization and scale uncertainty) contribute to the diagonal elements\nonly. The hadronization and scale uncertainties are computed by combining the \u03b1S values obtained with the alternative hadronization models, and from the upper and lower\ntheoretical errors, using the weights derived from the covariance matrix V \u2032 .\nThe fit result from the 14 GeV data has large experimental and theoretical uncertainties.\nWe therefore choose\nto not include this result in the combination. The combination using\n\u221a\nall results for s \u2265 22 GeV is\n\u03b1S (MZ0 ) = 0.1159 \u00b1 0.0004(stat.) \u00b1 0.0012(exp.) \u00b1 0.0024(had.) \u00b1 0.0007(theo.) ,\n\n(7)\n\nconsistent with the world average value of \u03b1S (MZ0 ) = 0.1182 \u00b1 0.0027 [31]. The weights\nwi as described in Eq. 6 are 0.15 for 22 GeV, 0.29 for 34.6 GeV, 0.29 for 35 GeV, 0.06 for\n38.3 GeV and 0.21 for 44 GeV. The results at each energy point are shown in figure 5 and\ncompared with the predicted running of \u03b1S based QCD and on the world average value of\n\u03b1S (MZ0 ). For clarity the values\n\u221a at 34.6 and 35 GeV have been combined at their luminosity\nweighted average energy s = 34.8 GeV using the combination procedure described\nabove. The combined value is \u03b1S (34.8GeV) = 0.1368 \u00b1 0.0005(stat.) \u00b1 0.0017(exp.) \u00b1\n0.0032(had.) \u00b1 0.0011(theo.). The results of ALEPH [10], DELPHI [11] and OPAL [12]\nare shown as well.\n10\n\n\f5.3\n\nRenormalization Scale Dependence of \u03b1S\n\nFor the fits in Section 5.2 the renormalization scale factor is set to the natural choice\nx\u03bc = 1, where the energy dependence of Eq. 3 comes only from the running of the\ncoupling \u03b1S . However, different schemes for the determination of the renormalization\nscale factor are proposed. As a cross check of our default result we investigate in this\nsection two more choices of the renormalization scale factor.\nIn the optimized renormalization scheme [32] the minimization is performed for all energy\npoints with \u03b1S and x\u03bc treated as free parameters. The systematic uncertainties are\ndetermined using the optimized renormalization scale determined in the default fit. The\nvalue of \u03b1S , the optimized scale xopt\n\u03bc and their correlation are summarized in Table 3.

We\ntherefore conclude that the evaluation of theoretical uncertainties using the commonly\nused standard method of setting x\u03bc to 0.5 and 2. safely includes alternative methods of\nthe choice of the renormalization scale factor.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nIn this paper we present measurements of the strong coupling from the four-jet rate at\ncentre-of-mass energies between 14 and 44 GeV using data of the JADE experiment. The\npredictions of the PYTHIA, HERWIG and ARIADNE Monte Carlo models tuned by\nOPAL to LEP 1 data are found to be in agreement with the measured distributions.\nFrom a fit of QCD NLO predictions combined with resummed NLLA calculations with\nx\u03bc =1 to the four-jet rate corrected for experimental and hadronization effects we have\ndetermined the strong coupling \u03b1S . In addition we investigated two more choices for the\ndetermination of the renormalization scale and found the results to be consistent. The\nvalue of \u03b1S (MZ0 ) is determined to be \u03b1S (MZ0 ) = 0.1159\u00b10.0028 (total error). The natural\nchoice of the renormalization scale x\u03bc = 1 is close to the renormalization scale factor with\nS\n\u03b1S having the least sensitivity to the renormalization scale factor, d\u03b1\n= 0. Therefore the\ndx\u03bc\ntheoretical uncertainty determined by setting the scale x\u03bc to x\u03bc =0.5 and x\u03bc =2.0 yields\nsmaller theoretical uncertainties than e.g. for fits to event shape observables [16]. This is\nalso true for measurements of \u03b1S performed at LEP energies [12].\n\nReferences\n[1] B. Naroska, Phys. Rept. 148 (1987) 67.\n12\n\n\f[2] S. Catani et al.,Phys. Lett.
