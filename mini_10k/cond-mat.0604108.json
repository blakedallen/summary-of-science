We find that AH\nconductivity vanishes unless the lifetime is spin-dependent, similar to the spin Hall (SH) conductivity\nin the non-magnetic system. In addition, we find that the SH conductivity does not vanish in the\npresence of magnetic scatterers. We show that the SH conductivity can be controlled by changing\nthe amount of the magnetic impurities.\n\nThe spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in semiconductors allows optical and electrical control of spins, and because\nof this has recently attracted much attention in the field\nof spintronics. The SOI gives rise to unusual Hall effects, such as the anomalous Hall (AH) effect [1] in ferromagnets, and the spin Hall (SH) effect in normal conductors [2, 3, 4, 5]. The detailed mechanisms of these\neffects are still controversially discussed. For the AH effect, originally an intrinsic (i.e., band-structure induced)\nmechanism originating from an effective magnetic field\nin momentum space was put forward [6], followed by extrinsic mechanisms, referred to as skew [7] and side-jump\n[8] scattering at impurities. Most experiments have been\ninterpreted in terms of the extrinsic mechanisms, but the\nintrinsic AH effect has recently been shown to quantitatively explain the AH effect in ferromagnetic semiconductors [9, 10, 11]. While a current bias does not excite\na Hall voltage in normal metals at zero external field, a\nHall effect of spin currents should persist in the presence\nof intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. This spin Hall effect was\noriginally predicted assuming extrinsic scattering [2, 3],\nbut, analogous to the AH effect, an intrinsic SH effect is\nalso possible. Murakami et al.[4] predicted that the effective magnetic field associated to the Berry phase in the\nvalence band induce drift of up and down spin carriers\ntowards opposite directions in p-doped zincblende-type\nsemiconductors. Sinova et al.[5] predicted a universal\nspin Hall conductivity for the two-dimensional electron\ngas (2DEG) with a Rashba-type SOI produced by the\nasymmetry of the potential.\nRecently, two groups [13, 14] reported optical detection of spin accumulation of opposite signs at the sample edges in current-biased nonmagnetic semiconductors.\nSuch behavior can be caused by the extrinsic SH effect,\nas shown explicitly by Ref. [12] and is believed to be a\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: inoue@nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp\n\nsignature of the intrinsic SH effect as well. However, the\ninterpretation of the experimental results is not straightforward.\nCurrent theories predict that the intrinsic SH effect can\nstrongly be suppressed by disorder effects. Especially,\nthe intrinsic SH current vanishes identically by disorder\nscattering of electrons in the bulk of a Rashba-split 2DEG\n[15, 16, 17]. On the other hand, the Rashba-split 2DEG is\nbelieved to be rather special in this respect, since in other\nsystems the intrinsic SH effects survives disorder scattering. This has been demonstrated for 2DEGs with an SO\ninteraction that is not directly proportional to the wave\nvector, and for three dimensional systems in the presence\nof the Dresselhaus SO interaction, or a Luttinger type of\nSO interaction in the valence band[19, 20, 21].\nSince one may view the SH effect as the zeromagnetization limit of the AH effect, the vertex-canceling\nof the intrinsic SH in a Rashba-split 2DEG raises the\nissue whether or not the intrinsic AH effect is affected\nequally strongly by disorder scattering. And can, vice\nversa, the intrinsic SH effect survive in a disordered system when magnetic effects are added, e.g., carrier scattering by magnetic impurities? These are the questions we\naddress in this Letter. We focus on a disordered 2DEG\nwith the intrinsic Rashba-type SOI and investigate the\neffects of a constant exchange potential as well magnetic\nimpurities on the AH and SH effects by generalizing the\nmethod we applied previously [15, 25] to calculate the\nconductivity in the diffusive transport regime.\nWe will show that the intrinsic AH conductivity in\nRashba split 2DEG with uniform spin polarization vanishes unless the life-time is spin-dependent, which is correct up to the second order of the SOI. This exemplifies\nthe strong similarity between SH and AH effects. We\nalso find that the SH conductivity is non-zero in the\npresence of magnetic impurity scattering. These results\nare not only relevant for a full understanding of the Hall\neffects [22, 23], but should also apply to high g-factor,\nhigh mobility narrow gap magnetic semiconductors such\n\n\f2\nas (Hg,Mn)Te that exhibit many of the features needed\nfor a clean observation of the intrinsic SOI induced Hall\neffects[24] in a transport experiment.\nWe start with the Hamiltonian\nH = H0 + Vm ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H0 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian for the 2DEG\nand Vm the random potential caused by impurities. For\nthe non-magnetic 2DEG, H0 equals the Rashba Hamiltonian HR . In Pauli-spin and momentum space we have\n\nHR =\n\n~2 2\n2m k\n\n\u2212i\u03bb~k+\n\ni\u03bb~k\u2212\n~2 2\n2m k\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere k\u00b1 = kx \u00b1 iky with in-plane momentum vector\nk = (kx , ky ) and \u03bb is the tunable strength of the spinorbit coupling.

We can then proceed\nto obtain the AH and SH conductivities as before by\nadopting the Born approximation for the self-energy and\nthe ladder approximation for the current vertex that is\ndetermined self-consistently in order to satisfy the Ward\nidentity.\nAfter a lengthy but straightforward calculation along\nthe lines of Refs. [15] and [25], we have obtained the full\nexpression (not shown) for the AH conductivity in terms\nof retarded and advanced Green functions in the Pauli\nspin space. The momentum integration of the products\nof retarded and advanced Green function has been done\nanalytically by assuming \u03bb \u226a \u2206ex and keeping terms up\nto \u03bb2 and in the clean limit with life-time broadening\nbeing smaller than the Rashba-splitting of the bands.\nBy \u0001ignoring\nthe real part of the self-energy, \u03a3\u03c3 =\nP\n2\n2\nn/L2\nk |V\u03c3 |gk\u03c3 , where n/L is the impurity density,\nand with lifetime \u03c4\u03c3 = ~/2|\u03a3\u03c3 | we obtain\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\n4e2 \u03bb2 D0\n4\u22062ex + (|\u03a3\u2191 | + |\u03a3\u2193 |)\n\n2\n\n\u00d7 [\u2212\u01ebF \u2191 |\u03a3\u2193 |\u03c4\u2191 + \u01ebF \u2193 |\u03a3\u2191 |\u03c4\u2193\n\n#\n(\u01ebF \u2191 \u03c4\u2191 \u2212 \u01ebF \u2193 \u03c4\u2193 )2 \u2206ex (|\u03a3\u2191 | + |\u03a3\u2193 | + C)\n,\n+\n1/2\n4\u22062ex + C 2\n(\u03c4\u2191 \u03c4\u2193 )\n\n(9)\n\nrespectively.\nIn order to deal with the AH and SH conductivities in\nthe diffusive transport regime, we modify the Hamiltonian accordingly. In the calculation of the AH conductivity, the unperturbed part of the Hamiltonian is given\nas\n\nwhere D0 = me /2\u03c0~2 is the 2DEG density of states and\n\nH0 = HR + \u2206ex \u03c3z ,\n\nThe first two terms inside the square brackets in Eq. (9)\nare the non-vertex (bubble) part, and the last originates\nfrom the vertex correction.\nAH\nWe can simplify the expression for \u03c3yx\nfurther, assuming that \u2206ex \u226b |\u03a3\u2191 |, |\u03a3\u2193 |, \u03c4\u2191(\u2193) = \u03c4 (1 + (\u2212)\u03b4) with\n\u03b4 \u226a 1, neglecting the self-energy part in the denominator, and expanding up to \u03b4 2 we have\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the second part expresses an exchange potential,\nwhere \u03c3z is the z-component of the Pauli spin matrix.\nThe random potential is supposed to be short-ranged and\nisotropic, but may be spin-dependent:\nX\nVm =\nV\u03c3 \u03b4(r \u2212 Ri ).\n(6)\n\n\u01ebF \u2191(\u2193) = \u01ebF + (\u2212)\u2206ex ,\n\n(10)\n\u00132\n\u0012q\nq\n2\n|\u03a3\u2191 | \u2212 |\u03a3\u2193 | .

We consider the\nregime in which the Kondo effect is not important.\nWe compute the transport properties via the Kubo formula, using the simplest possible definition of the charge\ncurrent operator\n\u0002\n\u0003\nJx(y) = e (~/m)kx(y) 1 \u2212 (+)\u03bb\u03c3y(x) .\n(8)\n\nAH\nSO\n\u03c3yx\n\u223c \u03c3xx\n\n\u0012\n\n\u01ebF\n\u2206ex\n\n\u00132\n\n|\u03a3| 2\n\u03b4 ,\n\u2206ex\n\n(12)\n\nSO\nwhere \u03c3xx\n= 2e2 \u03c4 D0 \u03bb2 is the correction to the longitudinal conductivity by the SOI in a presence of non-magnetic\nimpurities, and \u03c4 = ~/2|\u03a3|.\nThis is our main result for the AH conductivity. We\ncan draw several conclusions from the above expression.\nAH\nFirst, we very generally find that \u03c3yx\n= 0 when the carrier lifetime is spin-independent. This also follows from\ninspection of Eq. (9) and we have verified that this statement is valid even when the real part of the self-energy\nis retained. The cancellation of the bubble by the vertex part in this limit is realized only after self-consistent\nrenormalization of the latter. We note the similarity with\nthe SH conductivity which vanishes by introducing electron scattering by nonmagnetic impurities. One should\n\n\f3\nnote, however, again in analogy with the SH effect, that\nthe AH effect does not have to vanish for ferromagnets\nwith other band structures.\nSecondly, the AH conductivity is proportional to \u03bb2\nand independent of the life time \u03c4 (note that \u03c4 |\u03a3| in\neq. (12) is independent of the life-time), very similar to\nthe extrinsic AH conductivity based on the side-jump\nmechanism [26]. Our expression is not identical that\nfor side-jump scattering, however; for example, Crepieux\nAH,sidejump\nand Bruno [27] obtained a non-zero \u03c3yx\neven in\nthe limit \u03c4\u2191 = \u03c4\u2193 with a constant magnetic moment M .\nSkew scattering does not occur in our model since the\nSOI is intrinsic and homogenous, and carrier scattering\nis caused by an impurity potential that does not contain\nSOI.\nFinally, the AH conductivity is odd with respect to\nthe magnetization M , since \u2206ex \u221d M . Therefore, the\nAH conductivity changes sign when the magnetization\nAH\nis reversed, as expected. We see in Eq. (12) \u03c3yx\nincreases with decreasing M . Although Eq. (12) may\nnot be strictly valid for M \u2192 0 because we assumed\nAH\n\u2206 \u226b |\u03a3\u2191 |, |\u03a3\u2193 |, \u03c3yx\nhas to vanish in this limit. Thus we\nexpect a non-monotonic dependence of \u03c3yx on M .\nWe now turn to magnetic impurity effects on the\nSH conductivity. To this end, we will introduce spindependent random potentials into Rashba-split 2DEG.\nThe random potentials of V\u03c3 are not suitable for the\npresent purpose, since hV\u03c3 i is spin-dependent which gives\nrise to a finite exchange potential (and quite trivially a\nfinite SH effect) in the lowest order approximation. We\ntherefore adopt an s \u2212 d type interaction \u03b4(r \u2212 Ri )si * Si\nbetween conduction electron si and localized impurity Si\nspins on a magnetic impurity at Ri . This type of interaction is isotropic, and no first order correction appears.\nThis isotropy persists in the presence of the Rashba SOI,\nso the self-energy and Green function are diagonal in\nthe |s = \u00b1i space which is a convenient basis. The\nself-energy in the Born approximation is proportional\nto the thermal average of a localized spin hS 2 i, which\nconsists of three contributions, one from spin-conserving\nscattering, h\u03c3z Sz \u03c3z Sz i, and two from spin-flip scattering, h\u03c3+ S\u2212 \u03c3\u2212 S+ i and h\u03c3\u2212 S+ \u03c3+ S\u2212 i. Accordingly, the\nself-energy\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n~ 1\n,\n(13)\n+\n|\u03a3| \u2243\n2 \u03c40\n\u03c4sf\nis governed by two scattering rates. 1/\u03c40 and 1/\u03c4sf correspond to the hSz2 i and (1/2) hS+ S\u2212 + S\u2212 S+ i contributions, respectively. In our case, 1/\u03c4sf = 2/\u03c40 since the\npotentials are isotropic.\nAfter evaluating the vertex corrections selfconsistently, we may define an effective current vertex\nas\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03bb + \u03bb\u2032\n~\nkk\nJ\u0303x = e\nkx 1 +\n(kx \u03c3z \u2212 ky \u03c3y ) ,\n(14)\nm\nk\nwhere \u03bb\u2032 is an effective SOI originated from the vertex\n\ncorrections which is the solution of\n2\n\u03bb\u2032 = \u2212h\u03c5m\ni [A + (\u03bb + \u03bb\u2032 )(B + D)]\n\n(15)\n\nwith\nnm J 2 hSz2 i\n.\n4L2\n\n2\nh\u03c5m\ni=\n\n(16)\n\nwhere nm /L2 is the density of magnetic impurities. The\nexpression of the current vertex \u03bb\u2032 is apparently[15, 25]\nthe same for magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities ex2\ncept for the definition of h\u03c5m\ni. A, B, and D are momentum integrals over products over retarded and advanced\nGreen functions that can be integrated analytically, such\nthat\n\u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb\n\n\u22060\n,\n8 + 7\u22060\n\n(17)\n\n2\n\n2\nwith \u22060 = (2\u03c40 \u03bbkF ) for magnetic impurities. Here h\u03c5m\ni\n2\n2\nhas been inverted to \u03c40 using the relation hSz i = hS i/3.\nNote that \u03bb\u2032 = \u2212\u03bb for nonmagnetic impurities[15]. The\nfinal result of the SH conductivity is the same for magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities\n\u03c3z\n=\n\u03c3yx\n\ne (\u03bb + \u03bb\u2032 )\n.\n4\u03c0~\u03bb\n\n(18)\n\nWe therefore find that the SH conductivity, which has\nbeen found before to vanish for nonmagnetic impurities,\nbecomes finite in the presence of magnetic impurities.\nThis is our main result concerning the SH effect.\nThere are two main reasons for the different SH conductivities for magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities.\nOne is the difference in sign in the matrix elements of\nthe random potentials. The matrix elements for the magnetic potential include terms hs = \u00b1|\u03c3z |s = \u00b1i, while in\nthe nonmagnetic case the corresponding matrix element\nis hs = \u00b1|1|s = \u00b1i which turns out to have the opposite\n2\nsign. The other reason is the expression for h\u03c5m\ni, which\n2\n2\nis proportional to hSz i, not hS i as in the self-energy because the hS+ S\u2212 + S\u2212 S+ i term couples with the linear\nterms of kx or ky and vanishes in the momentum integral.\nTherefore, the vertex function includes only \u03c40 , while the\nself-energy basically includes both \u03c40 and \u03c4sf .\nThe present results modify the expressions we obtained\npreviously[15, 25] for the longitudinal charge conductivity and the in-plane spin, as follows\n\u0015\n\u0014\nD0 \u22060\nn0\n,\n+ D0 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb (\u03bb + \u03bb\u2032 )\n\u03c3xx = 2e2 \u03c40\nm\n2 1 + \u22060\n(19)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2 + \u22060\nhsy i = 4\u03c0eD0 \u03c40 \u03bb \u2212 (\u03bb + \u03bb\u2032 )\nE,\n(20)\n1 + \u22060\nwhere n0 is the carrier density, and E is the applied electric field. Since these observables do not vanish under\nthe vertex correction even for nonmagnetic impurities,\nthe effect of modeling magnetic impurities is small.\n\n\f4\nFinally, let us consider the case where magnetic and\nnon-magnetic impurities coexist. Since there is no mixing between magnetic and nonmagnetic scattering, the\ncurrent vertex is still defined by Eq. (14), but now we\nhave\n\u03bb\u2032 = \u03bb\u2032m \u2212 \u03bb\u2032n ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u2032m and \u03bb\u2032n are effective SOIs caused by the magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities, respectively. Both\n2\nsatisfy Eq. (15) with h\u03c5m\ni for \u03bb\u2032m and with h\u03c5n2 i =\n2\n2\n\u2032\nnn hV i/4L for \u03bbn . Here, nn /L2 and V are the density of nonmagnetic impurities and impurity potential,\nrespectively. Then \u03bb\u2032 also satisfies the relation (15)\n2\nwith \u03b4h\u03c5 2 i = h\u03c5m\ni\u2212 h\u03c5n2 i, which determines \u03bb\u2032 selfconsistently.\nThe self-energy is on the other hand given by the sum\nof the contributions from magnetic and non-magnetic impurities, |\u03a3| = |\u03a3m | + |\u03a3n | \u2261 ~/2\u03c4,with\n\u0003m\n1 \u0002\n= nm 4J 2 hS 2 i + nn hV 2 i 3 .\n\u03c4\n~\n\n(22)\n\nConsider varying nm and nn such that the life time \u03c4 is\nkept constant. Noting that hSz2 i = hS 2 i/3 in the paramagnetic state, the effective spin-orbit interaction is then\ngiven as\n\u0015\n\u0014\n4\n~3 m\u03c4\n\u03bb\u2032 = nm J 2 hS 2 i \u2212\n\u03bb\n3\n\u03c4 m 2~3\n\u22060\n\u00d7\n\u0002\n.\n3 \u0003 m\u03c4\n4\n2\n1 + \u22060 + nm J 3 hS 2 i \u2212 \u03c4~m 2~\n3 (2 + \u22060 )\n\nthis case, the vertex correction itself vanishes, and the\nuniversal spin Hall conductivity is realized even in the\npresence of impurity scattering.\nThese results shed some doubt on Rashba's general argument for a generally vanishing SH conductivity [17].\nsince he introduced a vector potential by external magnetic field but neglected the Zeeman term. Indeed, the\nlatter gives rise to a non-vanishing spin Hall current even\nin Rashba split 2DEG [28]. It should also be noted that\nthe present results have been obtained for an infinite system. Finite size systems may show a non-vanishing SH\nconductance [29] or edge SH currents[28, 30].\nIn conclusion, we studied the intrinsic AH effect in the\ndiffusive transport regime for a spin-polarized 2DEG with\na Rashba-type SOI. We found that the AH conductivity\nvanishes unless the life-time is spin-dependent, indicating a strong similarity between the intrinsic AH and SH\neffects. Inclusion of a spin-dependent lifetime yields a\nnon-vanishing AH conductivity, the expression of which\nis similar to that obtained by the side-jump mechanism.\nThe SH conductivity for the Rashba 2DEG with magnetic scattering of electrons has found finite even in the\ndiffusive transport regime. The SH conductivity in the\npresence of both magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities\nshows that the SH conductivity may be controlled by\nchanging the amount of the magnetic impurities.\n\nThis expression reproduces the results \u03bb\u2032 = \u2212\u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 =\n\u03bb\u22060 /(8 + 7\u22060 ) for nm = 0 and nn = 0, respectively.\nAt an intermediate value of nm , \u03b4h\u03c5 2 i can be zero.
