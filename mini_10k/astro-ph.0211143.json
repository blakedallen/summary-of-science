At the center of the head of a comet is the nucleus. It is\ncomposed of chunks of matter. The most widely accepted theory of the comets, advanced\nin 1950 by Fred Whipple, is that the nucleus is \"a dirty snowball\". It constitutes ices of\nsuch molecules as water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, with dust mixed in. This\nmodel explains many observed features of comets. The nucleus itself is too small to be\nobserved directly from the earth. It is surrounded by coma which shines partly because\nof dust and gas reflecting sunlight. Gases liberated from the nucleus are excited by solar\n\u2217 e-mail\n\n: sanwal, msing, brij@upso.ernet.in\n\n\f2\n\nB. B. Sanwal et al.\n\nultra-violet radiation and radiate it in the visible, adding to the visibility of comets. The\nspectrum of a comet shows sets of lines from simple molecules. The comet is brightest\nand its tail is generally longest at the time of perihelion passage. However because of the\norientation presented to the earth, it may not appear longest at this stage. As the comet\nrecedes from the sun, its tail fades.\nTable 1.

Later on Smithsonian\nObservatory astronomers (IAU Cir. No. 7546, 2001) successfully photographed the comet\nwith 1.2-m reflector of Mount Hopkins, Arizona and at that time it's coma was 10 arcsec\nin size.\nOn February 1, 2002 a comet C/2002 C1 was discovered visually by veteran comet\nhunter Kaoru Ikeya with a 25-cm aperature reflector and by Daqing Zhang with a home\nmade 20-cm reflector. Ikeya has discovered four of the brightest comets of the past\ncentury, and this is his sixth comet. Zhang has been searching for comets for many years\n\n\fSpectrophotometry of comets\n\n3\n\n, but this is the first comet to carry his name. Marsden and Nakano (IAU Cir. No.\n7843, 2002) have noted the similarity of the orbits of comets C/2002 C1 and C/1661 C1\nand the numerical integration of the 2002 orbits backwards yields a previous perihelion\ndate within a couple of years of 1659, making the link rather likely. During March and\nApril 2002, comet C/2002 C1 was observable to northern hemisphere observers low in the\nwestern sky. It moved northward in the sky till 25 April. It has been faintly visible to\nthe naked eye from dark sky sites in March and remained a binocular object till late May\nor June. During March and April the comet showed an obvious tail which faded rapidly\nin April. Photographs taken on March 18, 2002 using CCD camera at the Cassegrain\nfocus of 104-cm telescope of State Observatory Nainital showed well developed tail and\nemission of discrete jets. The heliocentric distance on this date was 76 million km and\nthe geocentric distance was 120 million km. The tail was extended upto about 0.8 million\nkm and coma diameter was around 92 thousand km.\nExtensive obervations of every comet are needed to determine production rates, column densities and surface brightnesses. Time resolved imaging of both the plasma tail\nand coma are needed to investigate mechanisms giving rise to the observed morphologies\nand associated changes. Therefore we took spectrophotometric observations of comets\nC/2000 WM1 (LINEAR) and C/2002 C2 (Ikeya-Zhang) during December 2001, and\nMarch, April 2002 respectively.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data reductions\n\nThe spectrophotometric observational system consists of a HR-320 spectrograph, a CCD\ndetector, a detector interface and a computer. The spectrograph gives a dispersion of\n2.4 \u00c5/pixel with a grating having 300 g/mm blazed at 5000 \u00c5. At the entrance slit of\nthe spectrograph, a circular diaphram of 9 mm diameter corresponding to 2.33 arcmin as\nprojected on the sky (\u03c1) and centered on the coma of the comet was used. The 1K \u00d7 1K\nCCD chip covers about 2500 \u00c5 wide spectrum in a single exposure.\nAt least three spectral frames of the each comet were obtained every night in the blue\nand red part of the spectrum. Along with the comet, standard stars were also observed\nto calibrate the flux of the comet spectra. Sufficient bias, twilight flats and sky frames\nwere also taken. Data reduction is done using spectroscopic reduction software package of\nIRAF. We have used bright A-type spectrophotomeric standards to calibrate wavelength\nof the spectra and hence our wavelength correction may have uncertainity of \u223c 10\u00c5. The\nflux and wavelength calibrated spectra (converted to frequency) are shown in Figures\n1, 2 and 3. We have an usable range in spectrum from \u223c 3550 \u00c5 to 6000 \u00c5 for all\ndates. However on 15, 16, 18 and 29 April 2002, we have observed in red region also upto\n7000\u00c5 and combined the spectra after wavelength and flux calibration. Comet C/2002\nC1 is observed on six nights of Mar and Apr 2002 and comet C/2000 WM1 was observed\non three nights of Nov and Dec 2001 (Nov 20, Dec 1 and 6). However, it was found to\n\n\f4\n\nB. B. Sanwal et al.\n\nhave no significant spectral features on Nov 20. Basic data at the time of observations\nfor both the comets are given in Table 1.\n\n3.\n\nEmission bands, column densities and production rates\n\nThe prominent features, as can be seen in Figures 1, 2 and 3 are CN(\u2206v = 0) at 3883 \u00c5,\nC2 (\u2206v = +1, 0, \u22121) at 4695, 5165 and 5538 \u00c5 respectively. These features are weaker\nfor C/2000 WM1. In order to measure fluxes in these emission bands, the continuum\nin spectrum was located by selecting wavelengths 3600 \u00c5, 4350 \u00c5, 4850\u00c5, 5400\u00c5 and\n5800\u00c5 which are free from emission bands. The area of strong emission bands were\nmeasured and converted into the total flux. Emission band fluxes relative to C2 (5165 \u00c5)\nis given in Table 2.\nThe number of molecules of each species, contained in a cylinder of radius defined\nby the diaphram used, and extending entirely through the coma was evaluated using the\nexpression (Millis et. al. 1982) which is given as,\n\nlog M (\u03c1) = log F (\u03c1) + 27.449 + 2 log(\u2206r) \u2212 log g\n\n(1)\n\nwhere F is the observed flux in cgs units, \u03c1 is the projected radius of circular region in the\nsky at \u2206, r and \u2206 are the heliocentric and geocentric distances of the comet respectively\nin AU and g the fluorescence efficiency (in cgs units) per molecule at 1 AU. We used the\nvalues of fluorescence efficiency for C2 and C3 from Sivaraman et al (1987). Because of\nthe swing effect g varies significantly for CN with the comets heliocentric radial velocity.\nIn order to determine radial velocity, the orbital elements for C/2000 WM1 and C/2002\nC1 were taken from British Astron. Assoc. Cir. No.780, 2001 and British Astron. Assoc.\nCir. No. 782, 2001 respectively. During our observations the radial velocity varied from\n13.5 km s\u22121 to 30.0 km s\u22121 for C/2002 C1 and was \u223c 28 km s\u22121 for the C/2000 WM1.\nThe value of g was obtained for all the values of radial velocities from the Figure of\nTatum and Gillespie (1977). Therefore the variation of g has been incorporated in the\ncalculation of column densities of the molecule CN. The column densities thus obtained\nare listed in Table 3.\nThe column densities thus calculated were converted into production rates (Q), assuming a Haser model, through the relationship given by A'Hearn and Cowan (1975),\n\nM (\u03c1) = QV\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u0014Z\n\n\u03bcx\n\nx\n\n\u0015\nK0 (y)dy + (1/x)(1 \u2212 1/\u03bc) + K1 (\u03bcx) \u2212 K1 (x)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere V is the velocity of released species; x is the ratio between \u03c1 and daughter molecule\n\n\fSpectrophotometry of comets\n\n5\n\nscale lengths; \u03bc is the ratio between daughter and parent molecules scale lengths; K0 and\nK1 are modified Bessel functions\n\u221a of the second kind of order 0 and 1. Following Delsemme\n(1982) we assumed V = 0.58/ r. The parent and daughter molecular scale lengths are\ntaken from Cocharan (1985). The resulting production rates are given in Table 3.\nProduction rates for dust have been estimated on the simplest possible model, spherically symmetric, uniform outflow ignoring variations in particle sizes, scattering angle,\netc. The relationship derived by A'Hearn and Cowan (1975) is used to evaluate the\nproduction rate, Q, of dust in arbitrary units.\nQ = Lr2 /\u03c1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere L is the luminosity of the comet at \u03bb = 4850 \u00c5. The dust production rates evaluated\nare listed in Table 3.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussions\n\nThe prominent emission features as seen in Figure 1, 2 and 3 are CN(\u2206v = 0) at 3888\n\u00c5 and C2 (\u2206v = +1, 0, \u22121) at 4690, 5160 and 5530 \u00c5. The strongest feature in the\nwhole spectrum is due to C2 (\u2206v = 0) at 5167 \u00c5. Figure 4 shows the extended region of\nthe C/2002 C1 spectra around Na I emission at 5893 \u00c5, which has been detected also in\nthe earlier observation (IAU Cir. No. 7914, 2002). However, Na I emission line was not\ntaken into account for the purpose of calculating the parameters like production rates\nand column densities, as there was not sufficient signal at that wavelength. C/2002 C1\nwas nearest to the sun on March 23. Therefore the activity was maximum on that date.\nThis is reflected in the continuum and in the production rates of molecules and dust\nwhich is maximum on March 23. As the heliocentric distance increased the activity was\ndecreased.\nFigure 5 shows the production rates as a function of heliocentric distance for the comet\nC/2002 C1 and it varies approximately as r\u22122 for C2 , CN and dust which is in agreements\nwith the classical model of equilibrium vaporization of the nucleus. In the case of C/2000\nWM1 (LINEAR), the emission bands are weak although its total integrated magnitude is\nbrighter. This may be due to its large heliocentric distance (at the time of observations)\nand the contribution of dust production is higher in comparison to others. The weak\nemission bands observed in C/2000 WM1 inspite of its bright integrated magnitude is\nprobably because of the comets large heliocentric distance and because of much more\ndust content in comparison to other comets.\n\nReferences\n\n\f6\n\nB.
