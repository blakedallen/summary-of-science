It provides a technical solution to the famous hierarchy problem [3\u20136] and\ncontains the required ingredients to accommodate new physics [7].\nHowever, no experimental evidence of supersymmetry has been found so far at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) [8, 9]. Direct searches, based mainly on the existence of missing\ntransverse energy in the final state, have failed to find a signal that exceeds the SM background [10, 11]. This should encourage the search for non-minimal supersymmetric scenarios\nwith a departure from the usual supersymmetric signatures. Therefore, new strategies might\nbe necessary, such as those required to look for trilinear R-parity violation (RpV) [12, 13].\nThe non-observation of lepton or baryon number violating processes in nature sets strong\nbounds on the trilinear R-parity violating couplings. Furthermore, some SM processes are\nalso affected by the introduction of these couplings, which allows us to set additional experimental limits. Many studies in this direction can be found, see for example [14\u201316].\nThe lepton flavor violating (LFV) decay li \u2192 3lj , i 6= j, is a well-known process in\nsupersymmetry. However, although detailed computations exist in the literature [23, 24],\nsome of its properties have been missed until very recently. The dominance of the photon\nmediation diagrams, only affected by Higgs mediation in the large tan \u03b2 regime [25], has\nbeen part of the common lore for many years. This led to the simple relation\n\"\n#\n!\nm2li\n11\n\u03b1\nlog\nBr(li \u2192 lj \u03b3) ,\n\u2212\nBr(li \u2192 3lj ) \u2243\n3\u03c0\nm2lj\n4\n\n(1)\n\nwhich implies Br(li \u2192 3lj ) < Br(li \u2192 lj \u03b3). This is in fact true in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with lepton flavor violation. Contrary to this, it was\nrecently pointed out that the Z 0 -penguin, usually neglected or regarded as a subleading\ncontribution, can induce a huge enhancement of the signal in extended models and lead to\nBr(li \u2192 3lj ) > Br(li \u2192 lj \u03b3) [26]. This implies that some LFV studies need to be revisited\nin order to take into account the constraining power of li \u2192 3lj .\nOne of the extended scenarios where the Z 0 -penguin enhancement is found is trilinear\nR-parity violation. The additional lepton number violating interactions, not present in the\nMSSM, induce a large 1-loop Br(li \u2192 3lj ). This increase has been unnoticed in the existing\nliterature [27, 28]. Furthermore, the same Z 0 -penguins will also dominate the amplitudes for\n2\n\n\f\u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei and \u03c4 \u2192 lj P 0 decays (where P 0 is a pseudoscalar meson). We will\nuse these observables to set new bounds on the combinations of trilinear couplings involved.\nFinally, for the sake of completeness, we will also cover the 1-loop decays Z 0 \u2192 li lj and the\ntree-level decays li \u2192 3lj and li \u2192 lj lk lk and refer to Ref. [21] for an exhaustive collection\nof bounds coming from tree-level decays involving mesons.\n\nII.\n\nLEPTON FLAVOR VIOLATING OBSERVABLES IN R-PARITY VIOLATING\n\nSUSY\n\nIn this section we discuss how the flavor violating decays li \u2192 3lj , li \u2192 lj lk lk , Z 0 \u2192 lj lk\nas well as \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei and \u03c4 \u2192 li P 0 decays are induced in trilinear R-parity\nviolating SUSY. Although the focus of this work is the impact of the Z 0 -penguin on the 1loop induced li \u2192 3lj decays and \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei, we also study the loop induced\ndecay Z 0 \u2192 lj lk . In addition, the decays at tree-level are given for completeness in the\nappendix.\n\nA.\n\nLepton flavor violating three-body decays: li \u2192 3lj\n\nWe start our discussion with the leptonic three-body decay li \u2192 3lj , since this process\ngives a clear understanding of the impact of the Z 0 penguin. The total width of the 1-loop\ninduced li \u2192 3lj decay contains contributions from the photon penguin, the Higgs penguin,\nthe Z 0 -penguin and box diagrams. For instance, the amplitudes for the important photon\nand Z 0 penguins can be written as\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\n\u03bd\nT\u03b3\u2212penguin =\u016bi (p1 ) q 2 \u03b3\u03bc (AL1 PL + AR\nAL2 PL + AR\nuj (p)\n1 PR ) + imlj \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q\n2 PR\ne2\n\u016bi (p2 )\u03b3 \u03bc vi (p3 ) \u2212 (p1 \u2194 p2 ) ,\nq2\n1\n= 2 \u016bi (p1 ) [\u03b3\u03bc (FL PL + FR PR )] uj (p)\nmZ\nh \u0010\n\u0011i\n(l)\n(l)\n\u00d7\u016bi (p2 ) \u03b3 \u03bc ZL PL + ZR PR vi (p3 ) \u2212 (p1 \u2194 p2 ) .\n\u00d7\n\nTZ 0 \u2212penguin\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n0\nHere AL,R\n1,2 and FL,R represent the 1-loop form factors induced by the photon and Z -boson\n(l)\n\nexchange, respectively, and ZL,R are the standard Z 0 -boson couplings to the leptons. The\nlong expressions for the scalar penguins and boxes can be parametrized by the operators\n3\n\n\fI\nBL,R\n(with I = 1, . . . 4). The total width \u0393 \u2261 \u0393(li\u2212 \u2192 lj\u2212 lj\u2212 lj+ ) is obtained as [23, 24]:\n\nh\n\u0001\ne4\n2\n2\n5\nL R\u2217\nm\nAL1 + AR\n\u2212 2 AL1 AR\u2217\nli\n1\n2 + A2 A1 + h.c.\n3\n512\u03c0\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0012 16\n22\nmli\nL 2\nR 2\n+ A2 + A2\n\u2212\nlog\n3\nmlj\n3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0011 1\n2\n2\n1\u0010 L 2\nR 2\nR\nL\n+\n+\nB1 + B1\nB\u03022 + B\u03022\n6\n3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n2\n1\n2\n2\nR\nL\n+\n+ 6 B4L + B4R\nB\u03023 + B\u03023\n24\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 L L\u2217\nR R\u2217\n\u2212\nB\u03023 B4 + B\u03023 B4 + h.c.\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nL L\u2217\nR R\u2217\nL L\u2217\nR R\u2217\nA1 B1 + A1 B1 + A1 B\u03022 + A1 B\u03022 + h.c.\n+\n3\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\nR L\u2217\nL R\u2217\nL R\u2217\nR L\u2217\n\u2212\nA2 B1 + A2 B1 + A2 B\u03022 + A2 B\u03022 + h.c.\n3\n\u0001\n1\b\n2 |FLL |2 + |FRR |2 + |FLR |2 + |FRL |2\n+\n\u00103\n\u0011\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n+ B1L FLL\n+ B1R FRR\n+ B\u03022L FLR\n+ B\u03022R FRL\n+ h.c.\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2217\n\u2217\nL \u2217\nR \u2217\n+ 2 AL1 FLL\n+ AR\n1 FRR + h.c. + A1 FLR + A1 FRL + h.c.\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u2217\nL \u2217\nL \u2217\nR \u2217\n\u2212 4 AR\n.\n2 FLL + A2 FRR + h.c. \u2212 2 A2 FRL + A2 FLR + h.c.\n\n\u0393=\n\n(4)\n\nHere, FXY are functions of FL and FR and the Higgs and box contributions are combined\ninto B\u0302. Exact definitions can be found in [24]. We do not repeat them here for the sake of\nbrevity. Finally, Br(li \u2192 lj \u03b3), i 6= j, is completely determined by the same form factors AL2\nand AR\n2\nBr(li \u2192 lj \u03b3) =\n\n\u0001\ne2 5\n2\nmli |AL2 |2 + |AR\n|\n.\n2\n16\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\nFor many years the decay li \u2192 3lj has been believed to be dominated by photon exchange, with large Higgs contributions in the large tan \u03b2 regime [25]. This has been recently\nchallenged in Ref. [26], where it was shown that many simple extensions of the leptonic\nsector can lead to large enhancements for the Z 0 boson contributions. This may lead to\nZ 0 -penguin dominated scenarios where Br(li \u2192 3lj ) > Br(li \u2192 lj \u03b3). In fact, this can be\nunderstood from simple dimensional arguments. As shown in Eq. (4), the decay width is\nproportional to m5li , so both A and F form factors must have dimensions of inverse mass\nsquared. Thus we only have to determine what is the mass scale for each case. First, the\nvanishing mass of the photon implies that the only mass scale involved in the A form factors\n4\n\n\flj\n\nZ0\nlj\n\u03bd\u0303m\n\u03bd\u0303m\n\nli\n\n\u03bbimk\n\nlk\n\n\u03bbjmk\n\nlj\n\n(\u03bbmkj )\n\n(\u03bbmki )\n\nFIG. 1. 1-loop induced li \u2192 3lj decays. As shown in brackets, there are two possible combinations\nof \u03bb couplings: \u03bbjmk \u03bbimk and \u03bbmkj \u03bbmki . Moreover, we remind the reader that the \u03bb couplings are\nantisymmetric in the first two indices. Similar diagrams with the Z 0 boson line attached to the\nlepton lines are also possible.\n\nis mSU SY . On the other hand, the mass scale of the F form factor is set by mZ , the Z 0 boson\n\u22122\nmass. Therefore, we conclude that A \u223c m\u22122\nSU SY and F \u223c mZ . This fact can be checked\n\nanalytically in the complete expressions given in Refs. [23, 24]. With m2Z \u226a m2SU SY the Z 0\npenguin can, in principle, be even more important than the photonic one.\nHowever, in the case of the MSSM the photonic penguin is found to be numerically\ndominant [24]. This is caused by a subtle cancellation among the different Z 0 boson diagrams\n[26] which strongly suppresses their contribution to the amplitude of the process. We note\nthat a similar behavior was found in Ref. [35] for the decay B \u2192 Xs l+ l\u2212 .\nHowever, this cancellation can be easily spoiled by two effects, either (1) extended particle\ncontent, or (2) new interactions in the lepton sector. Trilinear R-parity violation is a simple\nexample of the second case. The additional interactions of the leptons lead to new loop\ndiagrams including charged leptons which do not suffer from the same cancellation as the\nwino does and induce a large increase in the li \u2192 3lj signal; cf. the Z 0 mediated diagrams\nin Fig. 1. It is the object of this paper to study how this increase, together with the current\nexperimental bounds, constrains the relevant parameter space. We will also shortly comment\non the impact of possible future improvements on the experimental limit for this observable\n5\n\n\f[34].\nSo far, we have not mentioned decays of the form li \u2192 lj lk lk with different generations of\nleptons in the final states. The reason is that these decays will always be less constraining\nthan li \u2192 3lj because of combinatorical factors which lead to Br(li \u2192 lj ) > Br(li \u2192 lj lk lk )\n[53].\n\nB.\n\n\u03bc \u2212 e conversion\n\nLet us now discuss \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei. This process is also mediated by photonic,\nZ 0 and Higgs penguins as well as box diagrams [36]. The Z 0 contributions are given by the\nsame diagram as shown in Fig. 1 with the two external leptons attached to the Z 0 replaced\nby quarks. The conversion rate can be expressed as [36]\n4\n2\n1 pe Ee m3\u03bc G2F \u03b13 Zef\nf Fp\nCr(\u03bc \u2212 e, Nucleus) =\n*\n\u0393capt\n8\u03c0 2 Z\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n(0)\n(1)\n(1)\n2 (0)\n* (Z + N) (gLV + gLS ) + (Z \u2212 N)(gLV + gLS ) + L \u2194 R\n\n(6)\n\nHere, Z and N are the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, Zef f is an effective\ncharge, Fp is the nuclear matrix element and \u0393capt denotes the total muon capture rate. The\n(J)\n\ndifferent contributions gXY (X = L, R; Y = V, S; J = 0, 1) are functions of the same form\nfactors A and F already introduced in Eqs. (2)-(3) as well as of scalar penguins and box\ndiagrams. For a detailed discussion we refer to Ref. [36].\nSimilarly, the decays \u03c4 \u2192 li P 0 get contributions from Z 0 mediated diagrams, which lead\nto the corresponding F form factors, and from pseudoscalar (A0 ) mediated diagrams [37].\nAs for \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei, one expects that the Z 0 -penguins dominate. Furthermore,\nit turns out that \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei and \u03c4 \u2192 li P 0 are even more constraining than\nli \u2192 3lj . This is mainly due to the very good existing experimental limits [29\u201331]. In\naddition, there are also very good experimental perspectives, with plans for a sensitivity\nfor \u03bc \u2212 e conversion rates as low as 10\u221218 \u2212 10\u221216 [32, 33]. A detailed comparison of the\nimportance of the different observables is given in section IV.\n6\n\n\fC.\n\nLepton flavor violating Z 0 decays\n\nAs already mentioned, we also present here results for the lepton flavor violating Z 0\ndecays. These have been discussed in the context of trilinear R-parity violation in Refs.\n[38, 39]. These decays are triggered by diagrams like the one given in Fig. 1 but without\nthe two leptons attached to the Z 0 boson. The branching ratio can be expressed as [40]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\n0\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\nBr(Z \u2192 li lj ) =\n2(|a1 | + |a2 | )MZ + (|a3 | + |a4 | )MZ .\n(7)\n\u0393Z 48\u03c0MZ\n4\nThere is only an explicit suppression by the SUSY scale for the contributions a3 and a4\nbut a1 and a2 are dimensionless. This observable has been discussed in the context of a\nSUSY SO(10) model in [40]. Because of this dependence on the different scales the authors\nhave observed in the considered SO(10) model that Br(Z 0 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bc) actually increases with\nincreasing universal scalar mass m0 , until it saturates. However, the overall impact of this\nobservable was found to be rather small because of the weak experimental limits. We note\nthat a similar behavior was found in [39].\n\nIII.\n\nTRILINEAR R-PARITY VIOLATION\n\nWe consider in this work the impact of the Z 0 penguins in the MSSM extended by the\nlepton number violating terms [12, 13]\n1 \u2032\n1\nWR/ = \u03bbijk L\u0302i L\u0302j \u00cakc + \u03bbijk L\u0302i Q\u0302j D\u0302kc\n2\n2\n\n(8)\n\nBounds for these trilinear couplings have been set so far not only by using lepton flavor\nviolating decays, but also \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei or cosmological observations. This\nlead to limits on individual couplings or specific products of couplings [14\u201321]. However, all\nstudies dealing with Br(li \u2192 lj lk ll ) have so far neglected all contributions but the photonic\npenguins. Also the bounds from rare Z 0 decays in case of trilinear R-parity violation have\nnot been presented in the literature so far.\nBefore we discuss the new bounds which arise if one performs the full calculation including\nall contributions, we comment shortly on the bilinear R-parity violating term which was\nskipped in Eq. (8). It is well know that the trilinear couplings will induce also a term \u03bai L\u0302i \u0124u\nduring the RGE evaluation [13, 22]. This term, as well as the corresponding soft-breaking\nterms B\u03ba Hu  \u0303li and m2  \u0303l\u2217 Hd , lead already at tree-level to a mixing between standard model\ni\n\nHd l i\n\n7\n\n\fand supersymmetric states. In addition, they generate small vacuum expectation values\n(VEVs) for the sneutrinos1 . However, the values of \u03bai are restricted by neutrino data and the\nsize of the additional VEVs by electroweak precision data. Therefore, the impact of bilinear\nR-parity violation and the related couplings on the lepton flavor violating decays considered\nhere are in general sub-dominant and numerically negligible [26]. The only exception can\nbe found when a large lepton-chargino mixing, which can open new tree-level channels, is\ninduced. However, also these contributions are suppressed by the SUSY scale and might\nonly be relevant for light spectra [42].\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nNUMERICAL ANALYSIS\nSetup\n\nThe numerical analysis has been performed by means of the Fortran package SPheno\n[43, 44] using the Mathematica interface provided by SARAH [45\u201347].\nThe Fortran code generated by SARAH to calculate li \u2192 3lj and li \u2192 lj \u03b3 is based on\nthe generalization of the formulas given in Ref. [24]. The routines for \u03bc \u2212 e conversion and\n\u03c4 \u2192 li P 0 are based on Refs. [36] and [37], respectively. The generic expressions for the\nrare Z 0 -decays have been calculated with FeynArts and FormCalc [48, 49] and have been\ncompared with the formulae of Ref. [40]: while we agree with the vertex correction, our\nresults for the wave function contributions are smaller by an overall factor of 2. The output\nof the SPheno code for \u03bc \u2212e conversion in nuclei, \u03c4 \u2192 li P 0 decays and lepton flavor violating\nZ 0 decays will become a new public feature of SARAH 3.1.0.\nWe want to stress that in case of the three-body decays or \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei\nour computation includes not only the photonic and Z 0 -penguins but also the contributions\nfrom Higgs penguins and box diagrams. Finally, SARAH writes the routines to calculate all\nthree-body decays of fermions at tree-level which were used to obtain the results given in\nthe appendix.\nTo disentangle the effect of the renormalization group evaluation we have first calculated\nthe MSSM parameters at the electroweak scale for three benchmark points given in Ref. [50].\nThese points are called BP1 - BP3 in the following. In addition, we have included a CMSSM\n1\n\nFor these and other aspects of bilinear R-parity violation and neutrino mass generation see Ref. [41] and\nreferences therein.\n\n8\n\n\fscenario which leads to sneutrino masses of \u223c100 GeV (point BP0). Although this point\nleads to a SUSY spectrum already ruled out by LHC searches, it is presented here to compare\nthe obtained results with the bounds previously given in the literature. Even BP1 might\nalready be borderline, especially as long as R-parity violating effects are small. However,\nwe have included it also here to close the gap between the old studies in the literature and\nthe points BP2 and BP3 with a heavy spectrum that satisfy all recent collider bounds. The\ninput parameters as well as some relevant masses are given in Table I. In the table we focus\non the relevant masses for the discussion and skipped those which play a negligible role in\nthe calculation of the constraints. As expected, the main result can in general be obtained\nfrom the diagram shown in Fig. 1. Similar diagrams with neutralinos or charginos give\nsmaller contributions.\nAfter the calculation of the MSSM spectrum, we switched on the different combinations\nof the RpV couplings which can open flavor violating decay or transition channels and\ncalculated the different observables at tree- and 1-loop level. The tree-level results are given\nin the appendix.\nIn the determination of the bounds we have used the most recent experimental upper\nlimits given in Table II.\nFor the 1-loop induced decays, the limits would not be improved if we also took into\naccount observables with two different generations of leptons in the final state. This is\ndue to the fact that \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 e+ \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc\u2212 and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ e\u2212 e\u2212 would only be triggered by box\ndiagrams which are in general suppressed with respect to the penguins. In addition, the\nbranching ratios for decays like \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 will always be smaller than those for a\nsingle flavor final state. The reason for this can be found in the relative factors of the\nZ 0 and photon contributions in the corresponding partial widths. They always lead to\nBr(li \u2192 3lj ) > Br(li \u2192 lj lj lk ) (j 6= k), see Ref. [53].\n\nB.\n\nResults for 1-loop induced observables\n\nThe focus in this section is on combinations of \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 which do not open flavor violating\ntree-level decay channels for the leptons if there is not any other source of lepton flavor violation2 . For those couplings all possible final states at tree-level are kinematically forbidden\n2\n\nPairs of \u03bb discussed in this section enable decays li \u2192 lj 2\u03bd at tree-level. However, the experimental\nlimits are very weak and thus the resulting bounds on the values of \u03bb's are not competitive with the ones\n\n9\n\n\fBP0\n[50]\n\nBP1\n\nBP2\n\nBP3\n\n10.1.1 10.4.1 40.2.5\nInput\n\nm0 [GeV]\n\n100\n\n125\n\n750\n\n750\n\nM1/2 [GeV] 100\n\n500\n\n350\n\n650\n\ntan(\u03b2)\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n40\n\nsign(\u03bc)\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nA0 [GeV]\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-500\n\nMasses\nd \u0303R , s\u0303R\n\n257.8 1017.5 1497.0 1483.5\n\nd \u0303L , s\u0303L\n\n261.0 1020.9 1503.8 1532.9\n\nb\u03031\n\n240.7 975.1 1434.2 1285.6\n\nb\u03032\n\n269.8 1065.9 1570.0 1364.7\n\n\u0169R , c\u0303R\n\n254.7 1024.3 1509.7 1477.8\n\n\u0169L , c\u0303L\n\n257.8 1063.1 1568.1 1531.0\n\nt\u03031\n\n190.3 812.1 1208.8 1095.0\n\nt\u03032\n\n331.8 1021.2 1466.1 1333.0\n\n\u1ebdR , \u03bc\u0303R\n\n115.2 229.7 450.2 788.6\n\n\u1ebdL , \u03bc\u0303L\n\n129.9 361.2 610.3 864.9\n\n\u03c4\u03031\n\n107.8 222.1 442.5 601.8\n\n\u03c4\u03032\n\n134.8 362.5 611.1 801.6\n\n\u03bd\u0303e , \u03bd\u0303\u03bc\n\n102.0 352.2 605.7 860.6\n\n\u03bd\u0303\u03c4\n\n101.4 351.0 603.5 787.0\n\nTABLE I.

The results for all other pairs of trilinear\ncouplings which do open tree-level channels are given for completeness in the appendix.\nBefore we present the updated bounds derived in our work, we briefly comment on earlier\nresults. In Ref. [28] the old MEG limit for Br(\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3) < 1.2 * 10\u221211 has been used and\nthe limits |\u03bb\u2217132 * \u03bb232 | < 2.3 * 10\u22124 and |\u03bb\u2217231 * \u03bb232 | < 8.2 * 10\u22125 were obtained. We have\nexplicitly checked with our code that, using the same experimental limit, one finds 2.1 * 10\u22124\nand 8.0 * 10\u22125 , respectively, for the same combinations of \u03bb couplings. This is in rather good\nagreement and gives an idea of the expected theoretical uncertainty.\nIt has also been shown in Ref. [28] that \u03bc \u2192 3e can be more constraining than \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3.\nHowever, this result was not based on the inclusion of the Z 0 -penguins but instead on\npolarization effects. They set the limits |\u03bb\u2217132 * \u03bb232 | < 7.1 * 10\u22125 and |\u03bb\u2217231 * \u03bb232 | < 4.5 *\n10\u22125 . These bounds can already be reached just by including the Z 0 -penguins, without the\nnecessity to consider polarization effects. In fact, for the spectrum of BP0 we get\n|\u03bb\u2217132 * \u03bb232 | < 6.8 \u00d7 10-5\n\n|\u03bb\u2217231 * \u03bb232 | < 4.6 \u00d7 10-5\n\n(9)\n\nAll the bounds evaluated using the spectrum of the benchmark point BP0 are collected\nin Table III. One can easily see that the limits from Z 0 decays are very weak but all other\nobservables provide bounds of the same order for most combinations of couplings. However,\nas already mentioned in the introduction, both li \u2192 lj \u03b3 and the photonic contributions to\nli \u2192 3lj and \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei scale as m\u22124\nSU SY [26]. Hence, if one only includes\nthese contributions all bounds are much weaker for a heavier spectrum like in BP1 to BP3.\nIn contrast, as shown in [26], li \u2192 3lj is much less sensitive to the SUSY scale as soon\n11\n\n\fl \u2192 l\u2032 \u03b3\n\nl \u2192 3l\u2032\n\nZ \u2192 ll\u2032\n\n|\u03bb\u2217123 \u03bb133 | 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22122 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n2.\n\n2.8\n\n|\u03bb\u2217123 \u03bb233 | 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 5.3 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n4.9\n\n7.9\n\n|\u03bb\u2217132 \u03bb232 | 9.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n3.5\n\n|\u03bb\u2217133 \u03bb233 | 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\n2.6 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n3.3\n\n|\u03bb\u2217231 \u03bb232 | 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n7.7 \u00d7 10\u22126\n\n2.7\n\n\u2032 ,\u2217\n\n1.9 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n1.3 \u00d7 10\u22121\n\n\u2032\n\n1.9 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n1.3 \u00d7 10\u22121\n\n\u2032\n\n1.9 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n1.1 \u00d7 10\u22121\n\n\u2032\n\n1.8 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n1.1 \u00d7 10\u22121\n\n\u2032\n\n5.2 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n2.7 \u00d7 10\u22121\n\n\u2032\n\n6.1 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\n3.0 \u00d7 10\u22121\n\n|\u03bb122 \u03bb\u2032222 | 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 7.4 \u00d7 10\u22125\n,\u2217 \u2032\n|\u03bb123\n\u03bb223 | 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 7.4 \u00d7 10\u22125\n,\u2217 \u2032\n|\u03bb132\n\u03bb232 | 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 7.1 \u00d7 10\u22125\n,\u2217 \u2032\n|\u03bb133\n\u03bb233 | 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 7.1 \u00d7 10\u22125\n,\u2217 \u2032\n|\u03bb133\n\u03bb333 | 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122\n,\u2217 \u2032\n|\u03bb233\n\u03bb333 | 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\nTABLE III.

Limits for the benchmark point BP1 on different combinations of LLE and LQD operators derived from low energy precision observables and the experimental limits given in Table II.\n\nBP2 because Br(\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3) is shifted to the right while Br(\u03bc \u2192 3e) has only slightly moved.\nThus indeed the bounds from li \u2192 3lj are less sensitive to an increase in the SUSY mass\nscale. And using Br(\u03bc \u2192 3e), it is possible to derive bounds on the couplings for the points\nBP1 - BP3 which are of the same order as those given in Eq. (9) for a light SUSY spectrum.\nThis can be seen in Tables IV to VI, where we give the limits of all combinations of trilinear\ncouplings which do not open channels for leptonic flavor violating processes at tree-level.3\nThus as discussed above, the bounds coming from observables which involve Z 0 penguin\ndiagrams depend only very mildly on the SUSY point. In fact, some bounds even get\nimproved slightly with a heavier mass spectrum. This is more pronounced in case of LQD\ncouplings. In particular, BP2 and BP3 are a bit more restrictive than BP1 and BP0. The\nreason for this can be found in the wave function contributions to the Z 0 penguins involving\nthe loop function B1 [24]\nm2\n\n1 1\nB1 (m2q , m2q\u0303 ) = \u2212 + log(m2q\u0303 ) \u2212\n2 2\n3\n\nm2q \u2212 m2q\u0303 + 2m21 log( mq\u03032 )\nq\n\n4(m2q\n\n\u2212\n\nm2q\u0303 )2\n\n(10)\n\nWith lepton flavor violating decays we refer only to processes with three charged leptons in the final\nstates.

The difference between these contributions is that for the first two combinations\nthe charged lepton can be right-handed while for the third case the lepton has to be lefthanded and has therefore a larger coupling to the Z 0 boson.\n-9\n\n-10\n\n-11\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n-12\n\n-13\n-6.0\n\n-5.5\n\n-5.0\n\n-4.5\n\u2032 ,\u2217\n\n-4.0\n\nlog(|\u03bb132 * \u03bb\u2032232 |)H,2\nlog(Zi,1\n\n-3.5\n\n-3.0\n\nYx,11\nH,2\nH,2\nH,2\n+ Zi,2\n), log(Zi,3\n+ Zi,4\n)\n\nlog(Cr(\u03bc \u2212 e, X))\n\n-9\n\nlog(Cr(\u03bc \u2212 e, X))\n\nSfrag replacements\n\nwith quark mass mq and squark mass mq\u0303 .

The dashed lines show the current upper experimental\n\nbounds.\n\n\u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei in the context of trilinear R-parity violation was also studied in\nRef. [28]. The limit obtained for instance for |\u03bb\u2217132 \u03bb232 | was 1.3 * 10\u22125 . This bound is based\non the same experimental limit of Cr(\u03bc \u2212 e, Ti) given in Table II for which we get nearly\nthe same value as for gold nuclei, namely |\u03bb\u2217132 \u03bb232 | < 1.5 * 10\u22125 .\nIn general, in most cases \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei or \u03c4 \u2192 li P 0 can be used to derive even\nstricter limits than those given by the three-body decays. The main reason for this is the\nvery good experimental limit due to \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in gold and, of course, the same small\ndependence on the SUSY masses due to unsuppressed Z 0 -penguins. This can be seen in\nFig. 3. The main points of the discussion about the limits given by loop induced three-body\n15\n\n\fdecays apply also here. However, there is one additional, interesting observation: \u03bc \u2212 e\nconversion in nuclei leads in the case of LQD couplings to a constraint for BP1 which is\nbetter than the one for BP0 by a factor of 2. This effect is larger than in the case of li \u2192 3lj\ndecays and not only caused by the logarithmic growth of the wave function contributions.\nThe main reason for the difference in the bounds comes from the photon contributions to\n\u03bc \u2212 e conversion which are, for BP0, of the same size as the Z 0 penguins. This leads to\na negative interference reducing the severity of the limits. The very heavy squarks in the\ncase of BP2 and BP3 are reflected by the very good limits for \u03bc \u2212 e conversion for LQD\ncouplings while the bounds from LLE are better for BP1 than for BP2. If the future plans\nto reach a sensitivity for the \u03bc \u2212 e conversion rate in Titanium of 10\u221218 [32] succeed, and\nno anomaly is observed, the corresponding limits are expected to improve by three orders\nof magnitude, e.g. BP2 would set a limit for |\u03bb\u2217231 \u03bb232 | of 4.3 * 10\u22127 .\nFinally, we comment on rare Z 0 decays. The flavor violating decays of the Z 0 gauge boson\ndo not set new constraints on the parameters. In fact, for many combinations of couplings\nthe resulting limits could only be estimated by extrapolation since they lie already in the\nnon-perturbative regime. Only when heavy quarks are present in the loop could the Z 0\ndecays be of some relevance. Using the expected experimental limits of Giga-Z [54] the Z 0\ndecays into \u03bc\u03c4 might reach the importance of the other observables. An estimate of the\npotential improvement on the bounds is shown in Fig. 4. We considered a future limit of\n1.0 * 10\u22128 for Br(Z 0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) and found a limit of O(10\u22122) on the product of the couplings.\nHowever, in case of lepton flavor violation in the \u03bc \u2212 e sector, the Z 0 decays will never reach\nthe current sensitivity of li \u2192 3lj or \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei. To get a comparable limit,\nfor instance for |\u03bb\u2217132 \u03bb232 | in case of BP3 of O(10\u22125), the limit of Br(Z 0 \u2192 \u03bce) should be\nimproved to O(10\u221219) which is far beyond the reach of the ILC with Giga-Z.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have considered in this paper the bounds on different combinations of LLE and LQD\noperators in case of trilinear R-parity violation obtained from the experimental limits on\ndifferent low energy observables. We have taken into account the 1-loop induced flavor\nviolating decays li \u2192 lj \u03b3, li \u2192 3lj , \u03c4 \u2192 li P 0 and Z 0 \u2192 li lj as well as \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in\nnuclei. It turns out that the Z 0 penguins dominate in most parts of parameter space, and\n16\n\n\fPSfrag replacements\n\nlog(Br(Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ))\n\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n-8\n-9\n-10\n\nYx,11\nH,2\nH,2\nH,2\nH,2\ng(Zi,1 + Zi,2 ), log(Zi,3 + Zi,4\n)\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\nlog(\u03bb\u2032233\n\n-1\n\n*\n\n0\n\n\u03bb\u2032333 )\n\nFIG. 4. Br(Z 0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03c4 ) for BP0 (blue) and BP1 (black). The red dashed line corresponds to the\ncurrent experimental LEP limit of 1.2*10\u22125 [52], the red dot-dashed line shows the limit of 1.0*10\u22128\nwhich might be reached by Giga-Z [54].\n\nespecially for heavy SUSY spectra, the amplitudes for li \u2192 3lj , \u03c4 \u2192 li P 0 and \u03bc\u2212e conversion.\nTherefore, the limits on combinations of \u03bb and \u03bb\u2032 couplings given by these observables\nchange only slightly between the different benchmark points. Taking into account the most\nstringent observables, \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei and \u03c4 \u2192 li P 0 decays, one finds for heavy\nSUSY scenarios improvements of several orders of magnitude with respect to the bounds\nalready present in the literature.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank Martin Hirsch and Werner Porod for fruitful discussions.

Moreover, we remind the reader that the \u03bb couplings are antisymmetric in the first two\nindices.\n\nquite a few combinations of \u03bb\u03bb parameters can be constrained.\nOne can compute the corresponding branching ratios by means of the effective 4-fermion\noperator obtained after integrating out the sneutrino [27]. This possibility is perfectly valid\ndue to the large hierarchy between the masses of the charged leptons and the mass of the\nsneutrino. However, we have taken a different approach, based on the exact computation of\nthe tree-level diagrams, with full 3-body phase space evaluation and including the widths of\nthe sneutrinos.\n18\n\n\fIn addition to the bounds given in Table II, we use for the tree-level decays observables\nwith two different leptons in the final state. The experimental upper bounds on the respective\nbranching ratios are [52]\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 e+ e\u2212 : 1.8 * 10\u22128 ,\n\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ e\u2212 e\u2212 : 1.5 * 10\u22128\n\n(A1)\n\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 : 2.7 * 10\u22128 ,\n\n\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 e+ \u03bc\u2212 \u03bc\u2212 : 2.7 * 10\u22128\n\n(A2)\n\nThe bounds obtained by these observables are presented in Table VII. It can be seen that\nthe bounds for couplings which open the \u03bc \u2192 3e decay mode are in agreement with [28] for\nBP0. All other bounds are also compatible if one considers the usual \u223c m\u22124\nSU SY scaling and\nin general the limits of couplings which are only sensitive to li \u2192 lj lk ll are much weaker than\nthose for couplings which enable also li \u2192 3lk . In addition, it is interesting to see that the\nbounds on RpV couplings at tree-level in general are not much better than those derived at\n1-loop. The reason is, of course, the different scaling of the Z 0 -penguin.\n\n[1] S. P. Martin, arXiv:hep-ph/9709356.\n[2] H. P. Nilles, Phys. Rept. 110 (1984) 1.\n[3] E. Gildener, Phys. Rev.
