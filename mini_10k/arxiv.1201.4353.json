Introduction\nThe wind-driven emission, transport, and deposition of sand and dust by wind are termed aeolian\nprocesses, after the Greek god Aeolus, the keeper of the winds. Aeolian processes occur wherever there is\na supply of granular material and atmospheric winds of sufficient strength to move them. On Earth, this\noccurs mainly in deserts, on beaches, and in other sparsely vegetated areas, such as dry lake beds. The\nblowing of sand and dust in these regions helps shape the surface through the formation of sand dunes\nand ripples, the erosion of rocks, and the creation and transport of soil particles. Moreover, airborne dust\nparticles can be transported thousands of kilometers from their source region, thereby affecting weather\nand climate, ecosystem productivity, the hydrological cycle, and various other components of the Earth\nsystem.\nBut aeolian processes are not confined to Earth, and also occur on Mars, Venus, and the Saturnian\nmoon Titan (Greeley and Iversen 1985). On Mars, dust storms occasionally obscure the sun over entire\nregions of the planet for days at a time, while their smaller cousins, dust devils, punctuate the mostly clear\ndaytime skies elsewhere (Balme and Greeley 2006). The surface of Mars also hosts extensive fields of\nbarchan, transverse, longitudinal, and star-like dunes, as well as other exotic dune shapes that have not\nbeen documented on Earth (Bourke et al. 2010). On Venus, transverse dunes have been identified by the\nMagellan orbiter (Weitz et al. 1994), while the Cassini orbiter has documented extensive longitudinal\nsand dunes on Titan (Lorenz et al. 2006).\nThe terms dust and sand usually refer to solid inorganic particles that are derived from the\nweathering of rocks. In the geological sciences, sand is defined as mineral (i.e., rock-derived) particles\nwith diameters between 62.5 and 2,000 \uf06dm, whereas dust is defined as particles with diameters smaller\nthan 62.5 \uf06dm (note that the boundary of 62.5 \uf06dm differs somewhat between particle size classification\nschemes, see Shao 2008, p. 119). In the atmospheric sciences, dust is usually defined as the material that\ncan be readily suspended by wind (e.g., Shao 2008), whereas sand is rarely suspended and can thus form\nsand dunes and ripples, which are collectively termed bedforms.\n1.1 Modes of wind-blown particle transport\nThe transport of particles by wind can occur in several modes, which depend predominantly on particle\nsize and wind speed (Figure 1.1). As wind speed increases, sand particles of ~100 \u03bcm diameter are the\nfirst to be moved by fluid drag (see Section 2.1.1). After lifting, these particles hop along the surface in a\nprocess known as saltation (Bagnold 1941, Shao 2008), from the Latin salto, which means to leap or\nspring. The impact of these saltators on the soil surface can mobilize particles of a wide range of sizes.\nIndeed, dust particles are not normally directly lifted by wind because their interparticle cohesive forces\nare large compared to aerodynamic forces (see Section 2.1.1). Instead, these small particles are\npredominantly ejected from the soil by the impacts of saltating particles (Gillette et al. 1974, Shao et al.\n1993a). Following ejection, dust particles are susceptible to turbulent fluctuations and thus usually enter\nshort-term (~ 20 - 70 \uf06dm diameter) or long-term (< ~20 \uf06dm diameter) suspension (Figure 1.1). Long-term\nsuspended dust can remain in the atmosphere up to several weeks and can thus be transported thousands\nof kilometers from source regions (Gillette and Walker 1977, Zender et al. 2003a, Miller et al. 2006). As\noutlined in the next section, these dust aerosols affect the Earth and Mars systems through a wide variety\nof interactions.\nThe impacts of saltating particles can also mobilize larger particles. However, the acceleration of\nparticles with diameters in excess of ~500 \u03bcm is strongly limited by their large inertia, and these particles\ngenerally do not saltate (Shao, 2008). Instead, they usually settle back to the soil after a short hop of\ngenerally less than a centimeter, in a mode of transport known as reptation (Ungar and Haff 1987).\nAlternatively, larger particles can roll or slide along the surface, driven by impacts of saltating particles\nand wind drag forces in a mode of transport known as creep (Bagnold 1937). Creep and reptation can\naccount for a substantial fraction of the total wind-blown sand flux (Bagnold 1937, Namikas 2003).\nThe transport of soil particles by wind can thus be crudely separated into several physical regimes:\nlong-term suspension (< ~20 \u03bcm diameter), short-term suspension (~20 \u2013 70 \u03bcm), saltation (~70 \u2013 500\n\u03bcm), and reptation and creep (> ~500 \u03bcm) (Figure 1.1). Note that these four transport modes are not\n4\n\n\fdiscrete: each mode morphs continuously into the next with changing wind speed, particle size, and soil\nsize distribution. The divisions based on particle size between these regimes are thus merely approximate.\n\nFigure 1.1. Schematic of the different modes of aeolian transport.

For instance, important constraints on both the ancient and contemporary history\nof Mars are provided by the inference of formative winds and climate from the morphology and observed\ntime evolution of aeolian surface features (Greeley et al. 1992a). Finally, as discussed above, wind-blown\nsand is also the main source of mineral dust aerosols.\nWe briefly review the wide range of impacts of wind-blown sand and dust on Earth, Mars, Venus,\nand Titan in the next sections.\n1.2.1 Impacts of mineral dust aerosols on the Earth system\nMineral dust aerosols can be entrained by numerous atmospheric phenomena (see Section 5.1.2), the most\nspectacular of which are probably synoptic scale (~ 1000 km) dust storms (Figure 1.2a). The interaction\nof dust aerosols with other components of the Earth system produces a wide range of often complex\nimpacts on for instance ecosystems, weather and climate, the hydrological cycle, agriculture, and human\nhealth. The importance of many of these impacts has only been recognized over the past few decades,\nresulting in a strongly increasing interest in the study of aeolian processes (Stout et al. 2009). But despite\nthe increasing number of studies addressing mineral dust, many of the impacts on the Earth system\nremain highly uncertain (Goudie and Middleton 2006, Shao et al. 2011a, Mahowald 2011).\nThe impacts of mineral dust on ecosystems arise predominantly from the delivery of nutrients by dust\ndeposition. Many ocean biota, such as phytoplankton, are iron limited (Martin et al. 1991), such that the\nsupply of bioavailable iron by the deposition of dust is hypothesized to be an important control on ocean\nproductivity (Martin et al. 1991, Jickells et al. 2005). Similarly, the long-term productivity of many land\n5\n\n\fecosystems is limited by the availability of phosphorus (Chadwick et al., 1999, Okin et al. 2004), such\nthat the deposition of dust-borne phosphorus is often critical for ecosystem productivity (i.e., primary\nbiomass production) on long time scales (thousands of years). For example, the productivity of the\nAmazon rainforest is probably limited by dust-borne phosphorus deposition (Swap et al. 1992). The\ndeposition of dust to both land and ocean ecosystems thus stimulates productivity, thereby also affecting\nbiogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen (Mahowald et al. 2011). Consequently, global changes in\ndust deposition to ecosystems are hypothesized to have contributed to changes in CO2 concentrations\nbetween glacial and interglacial periods (Martin 1990, Broecker and Henderson 1998) as well as over the\npast century (Mahowald et al. 2010). Moreover, dust-induced changes in CO2 concentrations may also\nplay a role in future climate changes (Mahowald 2011).\nDust aerosols also affect the hydrological cycle in several ways. First, dust redistributes energy by\nscattering and absorbing both solar and terrestrial radiation. This causes a net heating of the atmosphere,\nwhich generally enhances precipitation, but cools the surface, which generally suppresses both\nevaporation and precipitation (Miller et al. 2004, Yoshioka et al. 2007, Zhao et al. 2011). Second, dust\naerosols serve as nuclei for the condensation of water in both the liquid (as cloud condensation nuclei)\nand solid (as ice nuclei) phases (DeMott et al. 2003, Twohy et al. 2009). The resulting interactions\nbetween dust and clouds are highly complex and poorly understood, and can also either enhance or\nsuppress precipitation (Rosenfeld et al. 2001, Ramanathan et al. 2001, Toon 2003). Furthermore, the\ndeposition of dust on glaciers and snowpacks decreases the albedo (reflectivity) of these features, which\nproduces a positive (warming) climate forcing and an earlier spring snowmelt (Flanner et al. 2009,\nPainter et al. 2010).\nAs already alluded to in previous paragraphs, dust aerosols affect weather and climate through a wide\nrange of interactions. These include scattering and absorbing radiation, lowering snowpack albedo,\naltering atmospheric CO2 concentrations by modulating ecosystem productivity, and serving as cloud\nnuclei and thereby likely increasing cloud lifetime and reflectivity (Twomey 1974, Andreae and\nRosenfeld 2008). Since mineral dust therefore affects Earth's radiation balance, changes in the\natmospheric dust loading can produce a substantial radiative forcing (Tegen et al. 1996, Sokolik and Toon\n1996, Mahowald et al. 2006, 2010). Conversely, the global dust cycle is also highly sensitive to changes\nin climate, as evidenced by the several times larger global dust deposition rate during glacial maxima than\nduring interglacials (Rea 1994, Kohfeld and Harrison, 2001), and by an increase in global dust deposition\nover at least the past 50 years (Prospero and Lamb 2003, Mahowald et al. 2010). The radiative forcing\nresulting from such large changes in the global dust cycle is thought to have played an important role in\namplifying past climate changes (Broecker and Hendersen 1998, Jansen et al. 2007, Abbot and Halevy\n2010). Because of the large uncertainties in both the net radiative forcing of dust aerosols and the\nresponse of the global dust cycle to future climate changes, it remains unclear whether this dust climate\nfeedback will oppose or enhance future climate changes (Tegen et al. 2004, Mahowald et al. 2006,\nMahowald 2007).\nIn addition to these diverse impacts of dust on ecosystem productivity, weather and climate, and the\nhydrological cycle, dust aerosols produce a number of other important impacts. For instance, dust\nemission reduces soil fertility through the removal of small soil particles rich in nutrients and organic\nmatter, which contributes to desertification and reduces agricultural productivity (Shao 2008, Ravi et al.\n2011). Furthermore, heterogeneous chemistry occurring on atmospheric mineral dust affects the\ncomposition of the troposphere (Sullivan et al., 2007; Cwiertny et al., 2008), inhalation of dust aerosols is\na hazard for human health (Prospero et al. 1999, O'Hara et al. 2000), and dust might inhibit hurricane\nformation (Evan et al. 2006, Sun et al. 2008) and force coupled ocean-atmosphere variability in the\ntropical Atlantic (Evan et al. 2011).\n1.2.2 Impacts of aeolian processes on Mars, Venus, and Titan\nAeolian processes on Mars, Venus, and Titan differ substantially from those on Earth, primarily due\nto large differences in gravity and air density. On Mars, the lower air density makes it more difficult to\nmove surface material, but dust storms are nonetheless widespread and evidence of active sand transport\n6\n\n\fa\n\nb\n\nFigure 1.2.

The right\nimage was acquired on 4 September 2001, and shows dust shrouding most of the planet.

In contrast, the air\ndensity on Venus and Titan is much higher than on Earth. This greatly limits the terminal velocity of sand\nparticles, such that saltation on these planets is probably similar to saltation in water (see Section 2.4.2).\nThese large differences between the physical environment of the different planetary bodies produces\ncorrespondingly large differences in the properties of dunes, such as their typical length scales (Figure\n1.3).\nThe cycle of dust aerosols on Mars plays several important roles in the planet's surface-atmosphere\nsystem. Significant changes in local and regional surface albedos occur due to dust cover variations\ncaused by local, regional, and planet-encircling dust storms (Figure 1.2b; Thomas and Veverka 1979,\nGeissler 2005), and even by concentrated areas of dust devil tracks (e.g., Malin and Edgett 2001,\nMichaels 2006). Such albedo variations affect the surface temperature and potentially local- and regionalscale atmospheric circulations, as well as the overall surface energy balance of the planet (Gierasch and\nGoody 1968, Kahn et al. 1992, Fenton et al. 2007). The ever-present dust within the atmosphere strongly\nmodulates the planet's climate by significantly altering the absorption and emission of infrared and visible\nradiation by the atmosphere (e.g., Gierasch and Goody 1968, Kahn et al. 1992). Dust particles also likely\nserve as condensation nuclei for water- and CO2-ice cloud particles on Mars (Colaprete et al. 1999,\nColaprete and Toon 2002), which further modulates the planet's climate.\nAeolian processes are also the dominant natural agents shaping the surface of today's Mars (Greeley\nand Iversen 1985). A diversity of surface features attest to the relevance of aeolian transport for the\nmorphodynamics of the martian landscape, including ephemeral dark streaks associated with craters,\nmodified crater rims, and linear grooves and streamlined ridges or yardangs, which have also been\nobserved in Earth's deserts (Fenton and Richardson 2001). Moreover, migration of dunes and ripples has\nbeen detected in recent years from satellite images at many different locations on Mars (e.g., Bridges et\nal. 2012a), thus making it evident that saltation occurs during present climatic conditions. Nonetheless,\nthe rate of surficial modification of martian bedforms is thought to be orders of magnitude smaller than\nfor their terrestrial counterparts (e.g., Golombek et al. 2006a), although a recent study has surprisingly\nfound rates of surficial modification within an active martian dune field that are comparable to those on\nEarth (Bridges et al. 2012b). Questions regarding the age, long-term dynamics, and stability of martian\ndunes have thus motivated a body of modeling work in recent years, both through computer simulations\nand experiments of underwater bedforms mimicking martian dune shapes (Section 3.3.2).\nBecause the shape of dunes may serve as a proxy for wind directionality (Section 3.1.5), the\nmorphology of dunes on Mars, Venus and Titan can tell us much about the wind systems on those\n7\n\n\fplanetary bodies. For instance, the dominant occurrence of the transverse dune shape in the sand seas of\nVenus indicates that Venusian sand-moving winds are strongly unidirectional, while the large variety of\nexotic dune shapes on Mars indicates that a wider spectrum of wind regimes exists on this planet (Section\n3.3.2).\n\nFigure 1.3 Sand dunes in Morocco (a), on Mars (b\uf02dd) and on Titan (e). The barchan dune (a\uf02dc), which has a\ncrescent shape, is the simplest and most studied type of dune. It forms when the wind is roughly unidirectional and\nthe ground is not completely covered with sand (see Section 3.1.5). Barchans are widespread in Earth deserts and are\nalso a common dune form on Mars, where they can assume a surprisingly large diversity of shapes (Bourke and\nGoudie 2010). Mars hosts also many other exotic dune forms - such as the wedge dunes in Wirtz crater (d) -\nwhich could have been formed by complex wind regimes (see Section 3.3.2). Dunes on Venus and on Titan occur\npredominantly as sets of long parallel sand ridges, though the wind regimes leading to the formation of dunes on\nthese two celestial bodies are well distinct (see Sections 3.3.3 and 3.3.4).

The recently updated book \"The physics and modelling of wind erosion\" by Yaping\nShao (2008) provides a more up-to-date review of many aspects of dust emission and wind erosion. Other\nreviews focusing respectively on aeolian geomorphology (the study of landforms created by aeolian\nprocesses), the mechanics of sand transport, and on scaling laws in saltation were given by Nickling and\nMcKenna Neuman (2009), Zheng (2009), and Dur\u00e1n et al. (2011a). Recent reviews of the impact of the\nglobal dust cycle on various aspects of the Earth system were given by Mahowald et al. (2009), Ravi et\nal. (2011), and Shao et al. (2011a).\n\n8\n\n\fThe present article strives to complement these previous reviews by providing a comprehensive\nreview of the physics of wind-blown sand and dust on Earth, Mars, and other planetary bodies, with\nparticular emphasis on the substantial progress made over the past decade. Since saltation drives most\nwind-blown transport of sand and dust, we start our review with a detailed analysis of the physics of\nsaltation. In Chapter 3, we build on this understanding to review the formation and dynamics of sand\ndunes and ripples. We then focus on the emission of mineral dust aerosols on Earth and Mars through\nboth saltation impacts and other physical processes in Chapter 4, after which Chapter 5 discusses the\nmeteorological phenomena that produce dust emission. We round out the review in Chapter 6 with a\ndiscussion of important remaining questions in the physics of wind-blown sand and dust. This review is\nstructured in such a way that each chapter can be read in isolation.\n\n9\n\n\f2.\n\nThe physics of wind-blown sand (saltation)\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, saltation plays a central role in aeolian processes since it usually\ninitiates the other forms of transport, including the emission of dust aerosols that subsequently travel in\nsuspension (Chapters 4 and 5). Since there is no clear division between particles traveling in saltation and\nparticles traveling in lower energy creep or reptation trajectories, the discussion of saltation in this chapter\nis implicitly inclusive to the transport of particles in creep and reptation (Figure 1.1).\nSaltation is initiated when the wind stress \uf074 is sufficient to lift surface particles into the fluid stream,\nwhich for loose sand occurs around \uf074 ~ 0.05 N/m2 (Greeley and Iversen 1985). Following initiation, the\nlifted particles are accelerated by wind into ballistic trajectories and the resulting impacts on the soil bed\ncan eject, or splash, new saltating particles into the fluid stream. This process produces an exponential\nincrease in the particle concentration (Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011a), which leads to increasing drag on the wind,\nthereby retarding the wind speed in the saltation layer (Bagnold 1936). It is this slowing of the wind that\nacts as a negative feedback by reducing particle speeds, and thus the splashing of new particles into\nsaltation, which ultimately limits the number of saltating particles (Owen 1964) and thereby partially\ndetermines the characteristics of steady state saltation (Section 2.3).\nThe physics of aeolian saltation can thus be roughly divided into four main physical processes\n(Anderson and Haff 1991, Kok and Renno 2009a): (i) the initiation of saltation by the aerodynamic lifting\nof surface particles, (ii) the subsequent trajectories of saltating particles, (iii) the splashing of surface\nparticles into saltation by impacting saltators, and (iv) the modification of the wind profile by the drag of\nsaltating particles. After developing an understanding of these four processes in the following sections,\nwe discuss the transition to and characteristics of steady state saltation produced by the interaction of\nthese four processes in Sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. Finally, we investigate the characteristics of\nsaltation on Mars, Venus, and Titan in Section 2.4.\n2.1 The four main physical processes of aeolian saltation\n2.1.1 Initiation of saltation: the fluid threshold\nSaltation is initiated by the lifting of a small number of particles by wind stress (Greeley and Iversen\n1985). The value of the wind stress at which this occurs is termed the fluid or static threshold (Bagnold\n1941). This threshold depends not only on the properties of the fluid, but also on the gravitational and\ninterparticle cohesion forces that oppose the fluid lifting. A schematic of the resulting force balance on a\nsurface particle subjected to wind stress is presented in Figure 2.1. The fluid threshold is distinct from the\ndynamic or impact threshold, which is the lowest wind stress at which saltation can be sustained after it\nhas been initiated. For most conditions on Earth and Mars, the impact threshold is smaller than the fluid\nthreshold because the transfer of momentum to the soil bed through particle impacts is more efficient than\nthrough fluid drag (see Section 2.4).\nAn expression for the fluid threshold can be derived from the force balance of a stationary surface\nparticle (Figure 2.1). The surface particle will be entrained by the flow when it pivots around the point of\ncontact with its supporting neighbor (P in Figure 2.1). This occurs when the moment of the aerodynamic\ndrag (Fd) and lift (Fl) forces barely exceeds the moment of the interparticle (Fip) and gravitational (Fg)\nforces (Greeley and Iversen 1985, Shao and Lu 2000). At the instant of lifting, we thus have that\n(2.1)\nrd Fd \uf0bb rg Fg \uf02d Fl \uf02b rip Fip ,\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\nwhere rd, rg, and rip are the moment arms in Figure 2.1, which are proportional to the particle diameter Dp.\nThe effective gravitational force in a fluid, which includes the buoyancy force, equals\n(2.2)\n\uf070\nFg \uf03d \uf072 p \uf02d \uf072 a gDp3 ,\n\n6\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\nwhere g is the constant of gravitational acceleration and Dp is the diameter of a sphere with the same\nvolume as the irregularly-shaped sand particle. The particle density \u03c1p depends on the composition of the\nsand, but equals approximately 2650 kg/m3 for quartz sand on Earth (see Section 2.4). Furthermore, the\ndrag force exerted by the fluid on a surface particle protruding into the flow is given by (Greeley and\nIversen 1985, Shao 2008)\n10\n\n\fFd \uf03d K d \uf072 a Dp2 u* ,\n\n(2.3)\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03c1a is the air density, Kd is a dimensionless coefficient of the order of ~10 (see Table 3.1 in Greeley\nand Iversen 1985), and the shear velocity u* is a scaling parameter proportional to the velocity gradient in\nboundary layer flow and is defined as (Stull 1988, White 2006)\n(2.4)\n\uf074 \uf03d \uf072 u 2.\na\n\n*\n\nThe fluid shear stress \uf074\uf020is equivalent to the flux of horizontal momentum transported downward through\nthe fluid by viscous and turbulent mixing (see Section 2.1.4 for further discussion). A straightforward\nexpression for the fluid threshold shear velocity u*ft at which saltation is initiated can now be obtained by\ncombining Eqs. (2.1)-(2.3), which yields (Bagnold, 1941)\n\nu* ft \uf03d Aft\n\n\uf072p \uf02d \uf072a\ngDp ,\n\uf072a\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere the constant Aft is a function of interparticle forces, the lift force, and the Reynolds number of the\nflow (Greeley and Iversen 1985). By neglecting these dependencies and fitting Eq. (2.5) to the fluid\nthreshold of loose sand, for which interparticle forces are small, Bagnold (1941) obtained Aft \u2248 0.10. Note\nthat an expression similar to Eq. (2.5) can be used to describe the impact threshold u*it (see Section 2.4),\nfor which the proportionality constant Ait \u2248 0.082 (Bagnold 1937).\nIn order to derive an equation for u*ft applicable to a wide range of Reynolds numbers and particle\nsizes, an understanding of the lift and interparticle forces is required. We discuss these forces in the next\ntwo sections, after which we review semi-empirical relations of the fluid threshold that account for these\nforces and thus have broader applicability than Eq. (2.5).\n\nFigure 2.1. Schematic of the forces acting on a stationary sand particle resting on a bed of other particles (after Shao\nand Lu, 2000). Forces are denoted by thick arrows, and their moment arms relative to the pivoting point P are\nindicated by thin arrows. When the moment of the aerodynamic lift and drag forces exceeds that of the gravitational\nand interparticle forces, the particle will be entrained into the flow by pivoting around P in the indicated direction.\n\n11\n\n\f2.1.1.1 The possible role of lift forces in initiating saltation\nThe Saffman lift force is caused by the sharp gradient in the fluid velocity above the particle bed which,\ndue to Bernoulli's principle, creates a lower pressure above the particle than below it (Saffman 1965).\nMeasurements indicate that, at roughness Reynolds numbers (defined in Section 2.1.4.1) of ~102 \u2013 104,\nthe lift force is of the order of magnitude of the drag force (Einstein and El-Samni 1949, Chepil 1958,\nApperley et al. 1968, Bagnold 1974, Brayshaw et al. 1983, Dwivedi et al. 2011). On the basis of these\nmeasurements, Greeley and Iversen (1985) and Carneiro et al. (2011) argued that the lift force plays an\nimportant role in initiating saltation. However, at lower roughness Reynolds numbers of ~1 \u2013 10,\ncharacteristic for saltation in air, the theoretical treatments of Saffman (1965) and McLaughlin (1991)\npredict a lift force that is substantially smaller than the drag force. Measurements of the lift force at low\nReynolds number are difficult to make, but available numerical simulations and measurements are\nnonetheless consistent with these theories (Loth 2008). The Saffman lift force might thus play a relatively\nminor role in the initiation of saltation, consistent with the negligible role it plays in determining the\ntrajectories of saltating particles (see Section 2.1.2). Further research is required to settle this question.\nIn addition to the Saffman lift force, some experiments suggest that a lift force due to the pressure\ndeficit at the core of dust devils and other vortices might aid in lifting particles (Greeley et al. 2003,\nNeakrase and Greeley, 2010a) (see Section 5.3.2).\n2.1.1.2 Interparticle forces\nWhen granular particles such as dust and sand are brought into contact, they are subjected to several kinds\nof cohesive interparticle forces, including van der Waals forces, water adsorption forces, and electrostatic\nforces (e.g., Castellanos 2005). Van der Waals forces are themselves a collection of forces that arise\npredominantly from interatomic and intermolecular interactions, for example from dipole \u2013 dipole\ninteractions (Krupp 1967, Muller 1994). For macroscopic objects, the van der Waals forces scale linearly\nwith particle size (Hamaker 1937). Electrostatic forces arise from net electric charges on neighboring\nparticles (Krupp 1967). These charges can be generated through a large variety of mechanisms (Lowell\nand Rose-Innes 1980, Baytekin 2011), including through exchange of ion or electrons between contacting\nparticles (McCarty and Whitesides 2008, Liu and Bard 2008, Forward et al. 2009, Kok and Lacks 2009).\nFinally, water adsorption forces are caused by the condensation of liquid water on particle surfaces, which\ncreates attractive forces both through bonding of adjacent water films and through the formation of\ncapillary bridges between neighboring particles, whose surface tension causes an attraction between these\nparticles (see Section 4.1.1.1) (Herminghaus 2005, Nickling and McKenna Neuman 2009). Experiments\nusing atomic force microscopy have found a strong increase of cohesive forces with relative humidity for\nhydrophilic materials, but not for hydrophobic materials (Jones et al. 2002). Mineralogy and surface\ncontaminants affecting hydrophilicity can thus be expected to affect the dependence of cohesive forces on\nrelative humidity.\nAlthough the behavior of the different interparticle forces for aspherical and rough sand and dust is\npoorly understood (e.g., McKenna Neuman and Sanderson 2008), these forces can be expected to scale\nwith the area of interaction. By combining this assumption with the Hertzian theory of elastic contact\n(Hertz 1882), Johnson, Kendall and Roberts (1971) developed a theory predicting that the force required\nto separate two spheres scales linearly with the particle size. This JKR theory has been verified by a range\nof experiments (e.g., Horn et al. 1986, Chaudhury and Whitesides 1992), including experiments that\nexplicitly confirmed the linear dependence of the interparticle force on particle size (Ando and Ino, 1998,\nHeim et al. 1999). Therefore, absent a strong correlation of particle morphology or other surface\nproperties with particle size, the interparticle force is expected to scale with the soil particle size (e.g.,\nShao and Lu 2000).\n2.1.1.3 Semi-empirical expressions for the fluid threshold\nIversen and White (1982) used a combination of theory and curve-fitting to wind tunnel measurements\n(Iversen et al. 1976) to derive a semi-empirical expression for the saltation fluid threshold. Their\n12\n\n\fexpression is more general than that of Bagnold (Eq. (2.5)) because it includes the effects of lift and\ninterparticle forces. Specifically, Iversen and White (1982) expressed the dimensionless threshold\nparameter Aft in Eq. (2.5) in a series of semi-empirical equations valid for different ranges of the friction\nReynolds number R*t (see also Greeley and Iversen 1985):\n\nAft \uf03d 0.2\n\n\uf0281 \uf02b 0.006 / \uf072 gD \uf029 , for 0.03 \uf0a3 R\n\nAft \uf03d 0.129\n\np\n\n2.5\np\n\n1 \uf02b 2.5R*t\n\n*t\n\n\uf0281 \uf02b 0.006 / \uf072 gD \uf029 , for 0.3 \uf0a3 R\np\n0.092\n*t\n\n1.928R\n\n\uf0a3 0.3 ,\n\n2.5\np\n\n\uf02d1\n\n*t\n\n\uf0a3 10 , and\n\n(2.6)\n\nAft \uf03d 0.120 \uf0281 \uf02b 0.006 / \uf072 p gDp2.5 \uf029\uf07b1 \uf02d 0.0858 exp \uf05b\uf02d 0.0671\uf028R*t \uf02d 10\uf029\uf05d\uf07d, for R*t \uf0b3 10 ,\nwhere\n\nR*t \uf03d \uf072 a u*ft Dp / \uf06d ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nand where \uf06d is the dynamic viscosity.\nAlthough the semi-empirical expression of Iversen and White (1982) is in good agreement with a\nlarge number of wind tunnel measurements for varying conditions (e.g., Iversen et al., 1976), Shao and\nLu (2000) argued that Eq. (2.6) can be simplified substantially. In particular, they showed that the\ndependence of Aft on the Reynolds number appears limited, such that Eq. (2.6) can be simplified by\nassuming that Aft is independent of the Reynolds number. Shao and Lu (2000) furthermore assumed that\nthe interparticle forces scale with the particle diameter, which is supported by both theory and\nexperiments (Section 2.1.1.2). By balancing the entraining forces (aerodynamic drag and lift) against the\nstabilizing forces (gravity and interparticle forces), Shao and Lu then obtained a relatively straightforward\nand elegant expression for the saltation fluid threshold\n\nu* ft \uf03d AN\n\n\uf072p \uf02d \uf072a\n\uf067\n,\ngDp \uf02b\n\uf072a\n\uf072 a Dp\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere the dimensionless parameter AN = 0.111, which is close to the value originally obtained by Bagnold\n(Eq. (2.5)). The parameter \uf067 scales the strength of the interparticle forces; for dry, loose dust or sand on\nEarth, Shao and Lu (2000) recommended a value of \uf067 = 1.65\uf0b410-4 \u2013 5.00 \uf0b410-4 N/m. Kok and Renno\n(2006) obtained \uf067 = 2.9\uf0b410-4 N/m, consistent with this proposed range, by fitting Eq. (2.8) to the threshold\nelectric field required to lift loose dust and sand particles.\nThe above expressions of Iversen and White (1982) and Shao and Lu (2000) are compared to\nmeasurements of the fluid threshold in Figure 2.2. A critical feature of the threshold curves is the\noccurrence of a minimum in the fluid threshold for particle sizes of approximately ~75 \u2013 100 \uf06dm. At this\nparticle size, the interparticle forces are approximately equal in magnitude to the gravitational force, such\nthat the lifting of smaller and larger particles is impeded by increases in the strength of the interparticle\nand gravitational forces, respectively, relative to the aerodynamic forces. The occurrence of this minimum\nin the fluid threshold is critical in understanding the physics of dust emission (Chapter 4). Indeed, it\nshows that saltation is initiated at wind speeds well below that required to aerodynamically lift dust\naerosols of a typical size of ~1 - 10 \uf06dm. As a consequence, dust aerosols are only rarely lifted directly by\nwind (Loosmore and Hunt 2000). Instead, dust aerosols are predominantly emitted by the impacts of\nsaltating particles on the soil surface (Gillette et al. 1974, Shao et al. 1993a). However, several plausible\ndust lifting mechanisms that do not directly involve saltation have been proposed to occur on Mars (see\nSection 4.2).\nNote that the expressions for the saltation fluid threshold reviewed in this section are for ideal soils:\nloose, dry sand without roughness elements such as pebbles, rocks, or vegetation. As such, the\napplicability of these expressions is limited to dry sand dunes and beaches. In contrast, the emission of\ndust aerosols often occurs from soils containing roughness elements or soil moisture. Several corrections\n13\n\n\fare thus required to calculate the fluid threshold for saltation (and thus dust emission) for these soils. The\ncorrections for soil moisture content and for the presence of roughness elements are discussed in Sections\n4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2, respectively.\n\nFigure 2.2. Semi-empirical expressions (colored lines) and measurements (symbols) of the threshold shear velocity\nrequired to initiate saltation for Earth ambient conditions. Measurements of the fluid threshold for sand and dust are\ndenoted by filled symbols (Bagnold 1937, Chepil 1945, Zingg 1953, Iversen et al. 1976), whereas measurements of\nthe fluid threshold for materials other than sand and dust are denoted by open symbols (Fletcher 1976, Iversen et al.\n1976). The effect of the different density of these materials was accounted for by using the 'equivalent' particle\ndiameter defined by Chepil (1951): Dp,eq = Dp\uf072p/\uf072p,sand, where \uf072p is the particle density and \uf072p,sand = 2650 kg/m3.\nNote that this correction accounts for the effect of differences in material density on the fluid threshold (Eq. (2.5)),\nbut not for the dependence of fluid forces on the particle size through the Reynolds number (which the analysis of\nShao and Lu (2000) suggests might be limited), or the dependence of interparticle forces on the material type (e.g.,\nCorn, 1961). An alternative scaling proposed by Iversen et al. (1976) accounts for these first two effects, but not the\nlatter.\n\n2.1.2 Particle trajectories\nAfter saltation has been initiated, lifted sand particles undergo ballistic trajectories (Figure 1.1) that are\ndetermined primarily by the gravitational (2.2) and aerodynamic drag (FD) forces. The acceleration of\nparticles by the drag force transfers momentum from the fluid to the saltating particles and thus retards\nthe wind profile in the saltation layer (Section 2.1.4). The drag force acting on a particle submerged in a\nfluid is given by\n(2.9)\n\uf070Dp2\nFD \uf03d \uf02d\n\uf072 a CD vR v R ,\n\n8\nwhere v R \uf03d v \uf02d U is the difference between the particle (v) and wind (U) velocities, and vR = v R . The\n\ndrag coefficient (CD) is a function of the particle Reynolds number, Re \uf03d \uf072 a vR Dp / \uf06d (e.g., Morsi and\nAlexander 1972). The drag coefficient of natural sand is larger than that for spherical particles of the same\nvolume, both because their irregular shape produces a larger effective surface area than a sphere and\nbecause regions of large curvature can lead to flow separation, thereby increasing the drag (Dietrich,\n14\n\n\fFigure 2.3. The Magnus force (green line) and the Saffman force (blue line) as a fraction of the gravitational force\nduring the saltation trajectory of a 200 \uf06dm particle launched from the surface with a speed of 1 m/s at an angle of\n40\u00b0 from horizontal and a rotational speed of 400 rev/s. The arrows indicate the direction of particle motion. The\nparticle trajectory and lift forces were calculated using Eqs. 1 \u2013 6 in Kok and Renno (2009a), using the vertical\nprofile of the horizontal wind speed of Eq. (2.18) with u* = 0.20 m/s and z0 = Dp/30. The asymmetries in the\nrelative strength of both the Magnus and the Saffman force on the upward and the downward trajectories are due to\nchanges in the velocity of the particle relative to the flow, which determines the strength and direction of these\nforces. The effects of turbulence were neglected.\n\n1982). Parameterizations for the drag coefficient of natural sand, based on measurements of the terminal\nfall speed of sand particles, are summarized in Camenen (2007).\nIn addition to the gravitational and aerodynamic drag forces, secondary aerodynamic forces on an\nairborne particle include aerodynamic lift forces due to particle spinning (the Magnus force; Rubinow and\nKeller 1961), the gradient in the wind speed (the Saffman force discussed in Section 2.1.1.1), and several\nother minor forces reviewed in Dur\u00e1n et al. (2011a). Various authors have suggested that these lift forces\nplay a substantial role in saltation (White and Schulz 1977, White 1982, Zou et al. 2007, Xie et al. 2007,\nHuang et al. 2010). To further investigate this issue, Figure 2.3 shows the strength of the Magnus and\nSaffman forces relative to the gravitational force. Depending on the assumed spin rate, the Magnus force\nis of the order of 1% of the drag force and can affect individual saltation trajectories (White and Schulz\n1977, Kok and Renno 2009a, Huang et al. 2010). In contrast, the Saffman force is several orders of\nmagnitude smaller and has no substantial effect on particle trajectories.\nFurthermore, some authors have argued that electrostatic forces can increase particle concentrations\n(Kok and Renno 2006, 2008), affect particle trajectories (Schmidt et al. 1998, Zheng et al. 2003) and the\nheight of the saltation layer (Kok and Renno 2008), increase the saltation mass flux (Zheng et al. 2006,\nKok and Renno 2008, Rasmussen et al. 2009), and possibly affect atmospheric chemistry on Mars\n(Atreya et al. 2006, Farrell et al. 2006, Kok and Renno 2009b, Ruf et al. 2009, Gurnett et al. 2010).\nConsidering both the limited understanding of the processes that produce electrical charge separation\nduring collisions of chemically similar insulators such as sand (Lowell and Truscott 1986, McCarty and\nWhitesides 2008, Kok and Lacks 2009, Lacks and Sankaran 2011), as well as the limited measurements\nof electric fields and particle charges in saltation (Schmidt et al. 1998, Zheng et al. 2003), further research\nwill be required to establish whether the effect of electrostatic forces on saltation is indeed substantial.\nRecent reviews of the electrification of sand and dust and its effect on sand transport, erosion, and dust\nstorms on Earth and Mars are given in Renno and Kok (2008) and Merrison (2012).\n\n15\n\n\fSeveral studies have also argued that mid-air collisions between saltators can affect particle\ntrajectories and the mass flux at large shear velocities (Sorensen and McEwan 1996, Dong et al. 2002,\n2005, Huang et al. 2007). Recent results suggest that the probability of a saltator colliding with another\nsaltator during a single hop is on the order of 10-50 %, and increases with wind speed (Huang et al.\n2007). As with electrostatic forces, further research is thus required to establish the potential effect of\ninterparticle collisions on the characteristics of saltation.\n2.1.2.1 Turbulent fluctuations\nMost early numerical models of saltation neglected the effect of turbulence on particle trajectories\nbecause of the large computational cost (e.g., Ungar and Haff 1987, Anderson and Haff 1991). The steady\nincrease in computational resources has allowed more recent numerical models to explicitly account for\nthe effect of turbulence on particle trajectories (Almeida et al. 2006, Kok and Renno 2009a). The results\nof Kok and Renno (2009a) indicate that, for saltation on Earth, turbulence substantially affects the\ntrajectories of particles smaller than ~200 \uf06dm (Figure 2.4). However, the characteristics of turbulence in\nthe saltation layer remain uncertain, particularly because the effects of saltation on turbulence intensity\nand the Lagrangian timescale over which the fluctuating component of the fluid velocity is correlated\n(Van Dop et al. 1985) have been poorly studied. Indeed, Kok and Renno (2009a) reported discrepancies\nbetween the simulated and measured vertical flux profiles of ~100 \u2013 200 \uf06dm particles, which could\nindicate inaccuracies in the treatment of turbulence in numerical saltation models. In particular, some\nwind tunnel measurements indicate that the wakes shed by saltating particles can increase the turbulence\nintensity (Taniere et al. 1997, Nishimura and Hunt 2000, Zhang et al. 2008, Li and McKenna Neuman\n2012), which is not accounted for in most numerical saltation models.\n\nFigure 2.4. Simulated saltation trajectories for particles with diameters of (a) 100, (b) 150, (c) 200, (d) 275, (e) 375,\nand (f) 500 \u03bcm. The solid lines denote trajectories that do not include the effects of turbulence, whereas dashed lines\ndenote five (stochastic) simulations that do include the effects of turbulence. Particles are launched from the surface\nwith a speed of 1 m/s at an angle of 40\u00b0 from horizontal and a rotational speed of 400 rev/s. The particle trajectories\nwere calculated using the numerical saltation model COMSALT (Kok and Renno 2009a), for which the wind speed\nprofile and turbulence characteristics were obtained by simulating saltation at\ndistribution reported in Namikas (2003).\n\n16\n\nu* =\n\n0.4 m/s for the soil size\n\n\f2.1.3 Saltator impacts onto the surface and the splashing of particles into saltation\nThe ballistic trajectories of saltating particles are terminated by a collision with the surface. These particle\nimpacts onto the soil surface (\nFigure 2.5) are a critical process in saltation for two reasons. First, the splashing of surface particles by\nimpacting particles is, for most conditions on Earth and Mars, the main source of new saltators after\nsaltation has been initiated (see Sections 2.3.1 and 2.4). And second, since particles strike the soil nearly\nhorizontally and rebound at angles of ~40\u00b0 from horizontal (e.g., Rice et al. 1995), the impact on the soil\nsurface partially converts the saltator's horizontal momentum gained through wind drag into vertical\nmomentum. This conversion is critical to replenish the vertical momentum dissipated through fluid drag.\nThe impact of a saltating particle on the soil bed can thus produce a rebounding particle as well as one\nor more splashed particles. Analytical and numerical treatments of saltation need to account for the\ncreation of these particles, but since the interaction of the impacting saltator with the soil bed is complex\nand stochastic, this process is resistant to an analytical solution (Crassous et al., 2007). Instead, many\nlaboratory (e.g., Rice et al. 1995, Beladjine et al. 2007) and numerical experiments (Anderson and Haff\n1988, Oger et al. 2005, 2008) have been performed to better understand the splash function linking the\ncharacteristics of the impacting particle to those of the rebounding and splashed particles. Below, we\nsummarize the insights into the splash function gained from these experiments.\n\nFigure 2.5. High-speed images of the splashing of surface particles by an impacting saltating particle; the time step\nbetween two successive images is 4 ms.

Copyright (2007) by the American Physical Society.)\n\n2.1.3.1 Characteristics of the rebounding particle\nThe balance between saltators lost through failure to rebound and saltators gained through splash largely\ndetermines the characteristics of steady state saltation (Kok 2010a). Consequently, the probability that a\nparticle does not rebound is a critical parameter in physically-based saltation models. Unfortunately, there\nhave been very few studies of the probability that an impacting saltator fails to rebound, which contrasts\nwith the many published studies on particle splash (e.g., Nalpanis et al. 1993, Beladjine et al. 2007). The\nmost important exception is the numerical study of Anderson and Haff (1991), which suggested that the\nprobability that a saltating particle will rebound upon impact can be approximated by\n(2.10)\nPreb \uf03d B 1 \uf02d exp \uf02d \uf067vimp ,\n\n\uf05b\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\uf05d\n\nwhere vimp is the saltator's impact speed. Mitha et al. (1986) determined the parameter B to be ~0.94 for\nexperiments with 4 mm steel particles, whereas Anderson and Haff (1991) determined a similar value of\nB \u2248 0.95 for ~250 \u03bcm sand particles. That is, even at large impact speeds not all saltating particles\nrebound from the surface, because some will dig into the particle bed (Rice et al. 1996). The parameter \u03b3\nhas not been experimentally determined, although the numerical experiments of Anderson and Haff\n17\n\n\f(1991) indicate that it is of order 2 s/m. This value is roughly consistent with the value of \u03b3 = 1 s/m that\nKok and Renno (2009a) deduced from numerically reproducing the impact threshold, which is heavily\ndependent on Eq. (2.10) and the splash function. Note that the dimensionality of \u03b3 suggests that it could\ndepend on the particle diameter, the gravitational constant, the spring constant, and other relevant\nphysical parameters.\nIf the saltator does rebound, the average restitution coefficient of the collision (i.e., the fraction of the\nimpacting momentum retained by the rebounding particle) has been determined to lie in the range of ~0.5\n\u2013 0.6 for a loose sand bed by a wide range of numerical and laboratory experiments (Willetts and Rice\n1985, 1986, Anderson and Haff 1988, 1991, McEwan and Willetts 1991, Nalpanis et al. 1993, Rice et al.\n1995, 1996, Dong et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2008, Gordon and McKenna Neuman 2011). The mean\nrestitution coefficient appears to be relatively invariant to changes in particle size (Rice et al., 1995), but\ndecreases with the impact angle (Beladjine et al. 2007, Oger et al. 2008). Moreover, recent measurements\nby Gordon and McKenna Neuman (2009) indicate that the restitution coefficient is a declining function of\nthe saltator impact speed, which is consistent with both viscoelastic (Brilliantov et al. 1996) and plastic\n(Lu and Shao 1999) deformation of the soil bed during impact. However, experiments with plastic beads\nfound that the restitution coefficient remains constant or decreases only slightly with impact speed\n(Rioual et al. 2000, Beladjine et al. 2007, Oger et al. 2008), such that further research is required to\nresolve this issue.\nMeasurements indicate that the mean angle from horizontal of the rebounding particle's velocity is\naround ~30 \u2013 45o (McEwan and Willetts 1991, Nalpanis et al. 1993, Rice et al. 1995, Dong et al. 2002).\n2.1.3.2 Characteristics of splashed particles\nIn steady state saltation, the loss of saltating particles to the soil bed through failure to rebound (Eq.\n(2.10)) must be balanced by the creation of new saltating particles through splash. Numerical simulations\n(Anderson and Haff 1988, 1991, Oger et al. 2005, 2008), laboratory experiments (Werner 1990, Rioual et\nal. 2000, Beladjine et al. 2007), and theory (Kok and Renno 2009a) indicate that the number of splashed\nparticles (N) scales with the impacting momentum. That is,\n(2.11)\nN m v \uf03d \uf061m v ,\nspl spl\n\nimp imp\n\nwhere mspl and vspl are the average mass and speed of the particles splashed by the impacting saltator\nwith mass mimp. The experiments of Rice et al. (1995) indicate that the fraction \uf061 of the average\nimpacting momentum spent on splashing surface particles is of the order of ~15 % for a bed of loose sand\nparticles. (Note that the ejection of dust aerosols from the soil, which is impeded by energetic interparticle\nbonds, probably scales with the impacting energy instead (Shao et al. 1993a, Kok and Renno 2009a).)\nSince the number of splashed particles N is discrete, Eq. (2.11) produces two distinct regimes. For\ncollisions with N ~ 1, an increase in the impacting particle momentum will result in an increase in the\nmomentum of the single splashed particle, such that\n(2.12)\nv \uf03d \uf061v m / m .\n(N ~ 1)\nspl\n\nimp\n\nimp\n\nspl\n\nThis linear dependence of the speed of splashed particles on the impacting momentum is supported by the\nnumerical simulations of Anderson and Haff (1988, see Figure 2.6). Conversely, for collisions with N >>\n1, momentum conservation and Eq. (2.11) require that the average speed of ejected particles becomes\nindependent of the impacting momentum, as confirmed by the experiments of Werner (1987, 1990),\nRioual et al. (2000), Beladjine et al. (2007), and Oger et al. (2008). That is,\n\nvspl\ngDp\nwhere\n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf061\na\n\n,\n\n(2.13)\n\n(N >> 1)\n\ngDp nondimensionalizes the mean splashed particle speed, and the dimensionless parameter a is\n\na proportionality constant that scales the number of splashed particles (Kok and Renno 2009a):\n\n18\n\n\fN \uf03da\n\nmimp vimp\nmspl\n\ngD\n\n(2.14)\n.\n\nMeasurements (McEwan and Willetts 1991, Rice et al. 1995, 1996) and results from the numerical\nsaltation model COMSALT (Kok and Renno 2009a) indicate that a is ~ 0.01 \u2013 0.03. The simplest way to\ncapture the two limits of Eqs. (2.12) and (2.14) is then as follows\n\nvspl\ngD\n\n\uf03d\n\n\uf061\uf0e9\n\n\uf0e6\nmimp vimp \uf0f6\uf0f9\n\uf0f7\uf0fa ,\n\uf0ea1 \uf02d exp \uf0e7 \uf02d a\n\uf0e7\n\uf0f7\uf0fa\na\uf0ea\nm\ngD\nspl\n\uf0e8\n\uf0f8\uf0fb\n\uf0eb\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhich produces good agreement with numerical and laboratory experiments (Figure 2.6). The speed of\nsplashed particles is thus generally about an order of magnitude less than that of the impacting particle\n(Rice et al.1995). Most splashed particles therefore move in low-energy reptation trajectories and quickly\nsettle back to the soil bed. However, some splashed particles do gain enough momentum from the wind to\nparticipate in saltation and splash up more particles. This multiplication process produces a rapid increase\nin the particle concentration upon initiation of saltation (Section 2.2).\nMeasurements indicate that the distribution of splashed speeds at a given v ej follows either an\nexponential or a lognormal distribution (Mitha et al., 1986; Beladjine et al., 2007; Ho et al. 2012; see\nFigure 5 in Kok and Renno 2009a for a compilation). Furthermore, laboratory and numerical experiments\nindicate that the mean angle at which particles are splashed is ~40-60 degrees from horizontal (Willetts\nand Rice 1985, 1986, 1989; Anderson and Haff 1988, 1991; Werner 1990; McEwan and Willetts, 1991;\nRice et al. 1995, 1996, Gordon and McKenna Neuman 2011).\n\nFigure 2.6. The average dimensionless speed of splashed surface particles ( vspl / gD ) as a function of the\ndimensionless speed of the impacting particle ( vimp / gD ). Black and colored symbols respectively denote the\nresults from numerical (Anderson and Haff 1988, 1991) and laboratory (Willetts and Rice 1985, 1986, 1989, Rice et\nal. 1995, 1996; Gordon and McKenna Neuman 2011) experiments with natural sand. The dashed orange and green\nlines show the limits at N ~ 1 (Eq. (2.12)) and N >> 1 (Eq. (2.13)), respectively, and the magenta line denotes the\nprediction of Eq. (2.15). These relations used \uf061 = 0.15 and a = 0.016 (Rice et al. 1995, Kok and Renno 2009a).\n\n19\n\n\f2.1.4 Modification of the wind profile by saltation\nFollowing our review of the initiation of saltation through particle lifting by the fluid (Section 2.1.1), the\nsubsequent particle trajectories (Section 2.1.2), and the collision of saltating particles with the surface\n(Section 2.1.3), we now discuss the final critical process in saltation: the modification of the wind profile\nthrough momentum transfer to saltating particles. Indeed, it is the retardation of the wind profile through\ndrag by saltating particles that ultimately limits the number of particles that can be saltating under given\nconditions.\n2.1.4.1 Wind profile in the absence of saltation\nThe large length scale of the atmospheric boundary layer in which saltation occurs causes the Reynolds\nnumber of the flow to be correspondingly large, typically in excess of 106 for both Earth and Mars, such\nthat the flow in the boundary layer is turbulent. Since the horizontal fluid momentum higher up in the\nboundary layer exceeds that near the surface, eddies in the turbulent flow on average transport horizontal\nmomentum downward through the fluid. Together with the much smaller contribution due to the viscous\nshearing of neighboring fluid layers, the resulting downward flux of horizontal momentum constitutes the\nfluid shear stress \uf074. Because the horizontal fluid momentum is transported downward through the fluid\nuntil it is dissipated at the surface, \uf074 is approximately constant with height above the surface for flat and\nhomogeneous surfaces (Kaimal and Finnigan 1994).\nThe downward transport of fluid momentum through both viscosity and turbulent mixing equals (e.g.,\nStull 1988)\n\n\uf074 \uf03d \uf028K\uf072 a \uf02b \uf06d \uf029\n\n\uf0b6U x \uf028z \uf029\n\uf0b6U x \uf028z \uf029\n\uf0bb K\uf072 a\n,\n\uf0b6z\n\uf0b6z\n\n(2.16)\n\nwhere we neglect the contribution from viscosity since the turbulent momentum flux exceeds the viscous\nmomentum flux by several orders of magnitude for turbulent flows (e.g., White 2006). The eddy (or\nturbulent) viscosity K quantifies the transport of momentum in turbulent flows in analogy with the\nexchange of fluid momentum through viscosity, and U x \uf028z \uf029 is the mean horizontal fluid velocity at a\nheight z above the surface. The size of turbulent eddies that transport the fluid momentum is limited by\nthe distance from the surface, such that the eddy viscosity is usually assumed proportional to z (Prandtl\n1935, Stull 1988) as well as the shear velocity u* (defined in Eq. (2.4)),\n(2.17)\nK \uf03d \uf06bu* z ,\nwhere \uf06b \u2248 0.40 is von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's constant. (Note that recent results by Li et al. (2010) have called into\nquestion the presumed constancy of \uf06b during saltation.) Combining Eqs. (2.16) and (2.17) then yields\n\nU x \uf028z \uf029 \uf03d\n\n\uf0e6 z\uf0f6\nln \uf0e7\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0f7 ,\n\uf06b \uf0e8 z0 \uf0f8\n\nu*\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere z0 is the aerodynamic surface roughness, which denotes the height at which the logarithmic profile\nof (2.18), when extrapolated to the surface, yields zero wind speed. The value of z0 for different flow\nconditions is discussed in more detail below.\nEq. (2.18) is referred to as the logarithmic law of the wall and is widely used to relate the shear\nvelocity u* , and thus the wind shear stress \u03c4, to the vertical profile of the mean horizontal wind speed.\nHowever, there are several limitations to its use (Bauer et al. 1992, Namikas et al. 2003). First, Eq. (2.18)\nwas derived assuming that the shear stress in the surface layer is constant with height. This is a realistic\napproximation for flat, homogeneous surfaces, but can be unrealistic for other conditions, such as for\nsurface with non-uniform surface roughness or substantial elevation changes (e.g., Bauer et al. 1992).\nSecond, as discussed in the next section, the drag by saltating particles reduces the horizontal momentum\nflux carried by the wind. Therefore, determining u* requires measurements of the wind speed above the\nsaltation layer. Third, turbulence causes the instantaneous wind speed to substantially vary over time,\nsuch that Eq. (2.18) is only valid on timescales long enough for the fluid to access all relevant frequencies\nof the turbulence (Kaimal and Finnigan 1994, Van Boxel et al. 2004). Because of the large length scale of\n20\n\n\fthe atmospheric boundary layer (~1000 m), this time scale is of the order of ~10 minutes (Stull 1988,\nMcEwan et al. 1993). And, finally, Eq. (2.18) is technically only valid when the stability of the\natmosphere is neutral (that is, the vertical temperature profile follows the adiabatic lapse rate). Unstable\nconditions produce a lower wind speed at given values of z and u* , whereas stable conditions produce a\nhigher wind speed. However, the corrections required to account for the stability of the atmosphere in the\nwind speed profile of Eq. (2.18) are small close to the surface (Kaimal and Finnigan 1994), such that this\nequation can be considered sufficient for most studies of saltation.\nAn exception to the predominantly turbulent flow in the atmospheric boundary layer occurs near the\nsurface, where surface friction can cause viscous forces to dominate over inertial forces, resulting in\nlaminar flow. For a smooth surface, the thickness of this viscous (or laminar) sublayer is approximately\n(White 2006)\n(2.19)\n5\uf06d\n\uf064 vis \uf040\n,\n\n\uf072 a u*\n\nwhere \uf06d is the dynamic viscosity. The thickness of the viscous sublayer at the fluid threshold is ~0.4 mm\non Earth and ~2 mm on Mars. Consequently, sand particles protrude into the viscous sublayer, thereby\nenhancing turbulent transport by shedding wakes and partially dissipating the viscous sublayer. The\nthickness of the viscous sublayer thus depends on the size of these roughness elements, as denoted by the\nroughness Reynolds number (White 2006),\n(2.20)\n\uf072 ku\nRe r \uf03d a s * ,\n\n\uf06d\n\nwhere ks is the Nikuradse roughness (Nikuradse, 1933). For a homogeneously arranged bed of\nmonodisperse spherical particles we have that ks \u2248 Dp (Bagnold 1938), whereas for a more realistic\nirregular surface of mixed sand ks equals two to five times the median particle size (Thompson and\nCampbell 1979, Greeley and Iversen 1985, Church et al. 1990). For Rer > ~60, the turbulent mixing\ngenerated by the roughness elements is sufficient to destroy the viscous sublayer and the flow is termed\naerodynamically rough (Nikuradse 1933). Consequently, the aerodynamic surface roughness z0 (defined\nby Eq. (2.18)) is related in a straightforward manner to the Nikuradse roughness (White 2006),\n(2.21)\nz0 \uf03d ks / 30 . (Rer > 60)\nIn contrast, for Rer < ~4 the roughness elements are too small to substantially perturb the viscous\nsublayer, and the flow is termed aerodynamically smooth (Nikuradse 1933). In this case, the aerodynamic\nsurface roughness is thus proportional to the thickness of the viscous sublayer (Eq. (2.19)) and equals\n(Greeley and Iversen, 1985)\n\nz0 \uf03d\n\n\uf06d\n. (Rer < 4)\n9 \uf072 a u*\n\n(2.22)\n\nAeolian saltation on Earth takes place for roughness Reynolds numbers of ~1 \u2013 100 and thus usually\noccurs in the transition zone between the smooth and rough aerodynamic regimes (Dong et al. 2001).\nSince the roughness in the transition regime does not differ much from that in the aerodynamically rough\nregime (see figure 11 in Nikuradse 1933), most studies have used Eq. (2.21) to approximate the surface\nroughness (e.g., Anderson and Haff 1991, Sorensen 1991, 2004, Kok and Renno 2009a, Jenkins et al.\n2010). In contrast, the much lower air density on Mars causes saltation there to usually take place in the\nsmooth aerodynamic regime, resulting in values of z0 substantially larger than predicted by Eq. (2.21).\nHowever, most studies of martian saltation have still used this equation for z0 (e.g., White 1979, Almeida\net al. 2008, Kok 2010a, b) because, once saltation is initiated, the motion of the saltating particles through\nthe viscous sublayer dramatically increases the vertical mixing of horizontal fluid momentum (e.g., Owen\n1964), which likely eliminates the viscous sublayer (White 1979).\n\n21\n\n\f2.1.4.2 Modification of the wind profile through drag by saltating particles\nIn the presence of saltation, the logarithmic wind profile of Eq. (2.18) is modified by the transfer of\nmomentum between the fluid and saltating particles. Some of the downward horizontal momentum flux in\nthe saltation layer is thus carried by saltating particles, with the total downward momentum flux\nremaining constant. That is (e.g., Raupach 1991),\n(2.23)\n\uf074 \uf03d \uf074 a \uf028z \uf029 \uf02b \uf074 p \uf028z \uf029 ,\nwith the particle momentum flux \u03c4p given by (Shao, 2008)\n\uf074 p \uf028z \uf029 \uf03d \uf066 \uf028z \uf029\uf044vx \uf028z \uf029 ,\n\n(2.24)\n\nand where the fluid momentum flux in the saltation layer \u03c4a(z) reduces to \u03c4 for z above the saltation layer,\n\uf066 \uf028z \uf029 is the mass flux of particles passing the height z in either the upward or downward direction, and\n\n\uf044vx \uf028z \uf029 is the difference between the average velocity of descending and ascending particles. Numerical\n\nmodels find that \u03c4p decays approximately exponentially from a maximum value near the surface (Figure\n2.7). P\u00e4htz et al. (2012) derive the dependence of the e-folding length of the particle shear stress on\nphysical parameters such as particle size and the wind shear velocity.\nIn analogy with Eq. (2.4), the shear velocity within the saltation layer equals\n(2.25)\nu \uf028z \uf029 \uf03d \uf074 \uf028z \uf029 / \uf072 ,\n*a\n\na\n\na\n\nwhich similarly reduces to u* (the shear velocity above the saltation layer) for z above the saltation layer.\nCombining Eq. (2.25) with the analogs of Eqs. (2.16) and (2.17) for the saltation layer then yields\n\n\uf0b6U x \uf028z \uf029 1\n2\n\uf03d\nu* \uf02d \uf074 p \uf028 z \uf029 / \uf072 a .\n\uf0b6z\n\uf06bz\n\n(2.26)\n\nAlthough Eq. (2.26) does not have a straightforward analytical solution (Sorensen 2004, Dur\u00e1n and\nHerrmann 2006a, P\u00e4htz et al. 2012), its implementation in numerical saltation models allows a\nstraightforward calculation of the wind profile (see Section 2.3.2.4 and, e.g., Werner 1990). Moreover, by\nassuming a plausible function for the vertical profile of the particle shear stress, such as an exponential\nprofile (Figure 2.7), analytical treatments have been able to derive approximate expressions of the wind\nprofile (Sorensen 2004, Li et al. 2004) and the aerodynamic roughness length in saltation (Raupach et al.\n1991, Dur\u00e1n and Herrmann 2006a, P\u00e4htz et al. 2012; see Section 2.3.2.4).\n\nFigure 2.7. The particle shear stress as a function of height above the surface as simulated by the numerical saltation\nmodel COMSALT (Kok and Renno 2009a) for 250 \uf06dm particles. The dashed lines represent exponential fits to the\nnumerical results.\n\n22\n\n\f2.2 The path of saltation to steady state\nThe interplay of the four main saltation processes reviewed in Section 2.1 determines both the path to and\nthe characteristics of steady state saltation. After the saltation fluid threshold has been exceeded (Section\n2.1.1), particles lifted from the surface are quickly accelerated by the wind into ballistic trajectories\n(Section 2.1.2) and, after several hops, can have gathered sufficient momentum to splash surface particles\n(Section 2.1.3). These newly ejected particles are themselves accelerated by wind and eject more particles\nwhen impacting the surface, causing an exponential increase in the horizontal saltation flux in the initial\nstages of saltation (Anderson and Haff 1991, McEwan and Willetts 1993, Andreotti et al. 2010, Dur\u00e1n et\nal. 2011a). This rapid increase in the particle concentration produces a corresponding increase in the drag\nof saltating particles on the fluid, thereby retarding the wind speed (Section 2.1.4). This in turn reduces\nthe speed of saltating particles, such that a steady state is reached when the speed of saltating particles is\nreduced to a value at which there is a single particle leaving the soil surface for each particle impacting it\n(Ungar and Haff 1987). Due to the finite response time of saltating particle speeds to the wind speed, the\nhorizontal saltation flux can 'overshoot' the eventual steady state mass flux (Anderson and Haff 1988,\n1991; Shao and Raupach 1992; McEwan and Willetts 1993), after which the momentum fluxes of the\nfluid and saltating particles reach an equilibrium.\nThe distance required for saltation to reach steady state in the manner reviewed above is characterized\nby the saturation length (e.g., Sauermann et al. 2001). Its value depends on several length scales in\nsaltation, such as the length of a typical saltation hop, the length needed to accelerate a particle to the\nfluid speed, and the length required for the drag by saltating particles to retard the wind speed (e.g.,\nAndreotti et al. 2010). As reviewed in more detail in Dur\u00e1n et al. (2011a), these finite length scales cause\nthe saltation flux to require between ~1 (Andreotti et al. 2010) to ~10 \u2013 20 meters (Shao and Raupach\n1992, Dong et al. 2004) of horizontal distance to saturate. The cause of the large range of the saturation\nlength measured in the literature is not well understood, but is possibly due to differences in the soil size\ndistribution and the shear velocity (Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011a). As we discuss in Section 3.1.1, the saturation\nlength is critical for understanding the typical length scales of dunes.\nIn addition to the saturation length, there is another characteristic length scale over which the\nhorizontal saltation flux increases to a steady state: the fetch distance (Gillette et al. 1996). The\ncorresponding fetch effect arises because the atmospheric boundary layer flow adjusts to the increased\nroughness of the surface layer produced by saltation (discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.2.4). The\nincreased surface roughness acts as a greater sink of horizontal fluid momentum, which increases the\ndownward flux of fluid momentum, thereby increasing the wind shear velocity for a given free stream\nwind speed in the atmospheric boundary layer. This process acts as a positive feedback on saltation and is\ntermed the Owen effect after the theoretical paper of Owen (1964) that identified it. Field studies indicate\nthat the fetch distance for a flat field is of the order of ~100 meters (Gillette et al. 1996). After this initial\nincrease over the fetch distance, the near-surface shear stress relaxes to a lower equilibrium value. This\nresults in a decrease of sand flux with distance further downwind (McEwan and Willetts 1993), as\nrecently verified by field measurements of sand flux in a dune field (Jerolmack et al. 2012).\n2.3 Steady state saltation\nSaltation is in steady state when its primary characteristics, such as the horizontal mass flux and the\nconcentration of saltating particles, are approximately constant with time and distance. Since wind speed\ncan undergo substantial turbulent fluctuations, this is rarely true on timescales longer than minutes or\noften even seconds, causing saltation on Earth to be highly intermittent (Stout and Zobeck, 1997). In fact,\na substantial fraction of sand transport occurs in aeolian streamers or sand snakes (Figure 2.8), which are\nprobably produced by individual eddies of high-speed air (Baas and Sherman 2005). These streamers\nhave typical widths of ~0.2 meters, thereby producing strong variability on short time and length scales\n(Baas and Sherman 2005, Baas 2006). However, numerical models and field measurements indicate that\nthe saltation mass flux responds to changes in wind speed with a characteristic time scale of a second\n(Anderson and Haff 1988, 1991, McEwan and Willetts 1991, 1993, Butterfield 1991, Jackson et al. 1997,\nMa and Zheng 2011). Consequently, it seems plausible that saltation is close to steady state for most\n23\n\n\fconditions (Dur\u00e1n et al., 2011a). This hypothesis is experimentally supported by (i) the finding that\nparticle speeds near the surface do not depend on u* (see Namikas (2003) and Section 2.3.2.1), (ii) the\noccurrence of the Bagnold focus (Figure 2.9), and (iii) the relative insensitivity of the saltation layer\nheight to changes in u* (Section 2.3.2.2). All these observations are consistent with theories and\nnumerical models of steady-state saltation. Nonetheless, more measurements are needed to explicitly test\nto what extent natural saltation is in steady state.\nNote that this section reviews the steady state characteristics of transport limited saltation, for which\nthe amount of saltating sand is limited by the availability of wind momentum to transport the sand. This\ncontrasts with supply limited saltation, for which the amount of saltating sand is limited by the availability\nof loose soil particles that can participate in saltation, which can occur for crusted or wet soils (e.g. Rice\net al. 1996, Gomes et al. 2003). The characteristics of supply limited saltation are reviewed in Nickling\nand McKenna Neuman (2009).\nThe particle concentration in transport limited saltation is in steady state when there is exactly one\nparticle leaving the soil bed for each particle impacting it (Ungar and Haff 1987, Andreotti 2004, Kok\n2010a). An equivalent constraint is that for each saltating particle lost to the soil bed due to failure to\nrebound upon impact (Section 2.1.3.1), another particle must be lifted from the soil bed and brought into\nsaltation by either splash or aerodynamic entrainment (Shao and Li 1999, Doorschot and Lehning 2002).\nIn order to understand and predict the characteristics of steady state saltation we thus need to determine\nwhether particles are lifted predominantly by fluid drag or through splashing by impacting saltating\nparticles. We do so in the next section.\n\nFigure 2.8. Aeolian streamers moving toward the observer. Reprinted from Baas (2008), with permission from\nElsevier.\n\n24\n\n\fFigure 2.9. Measurements of the wind profile during saltation of ~250 \uf06dm sand by Bagnold (1938) and Rasmussen\net al. (1996) show the occurrence of a 'focus' of wind profiles close to the surface (panels (a) and (b)). This Bagnold\nfocus can be reproduced by saltation models that account for the occurrence of splash as the main particle\nentrainment mechanism (panel (c); also see e.g. Werner 1990), but not by models that use Owen's hypothesis that\nfluid lifting is the main particle entrainment mechanism (d).\n\n2.3.1 Is particle lifting in steady state due to aerodynamic or splash entrainment?\nIn his influential theoretical paper, Owen (1964) argued that the near horizontal impact of saltators on the\nsoil surface would be ineffective at mobilizing surface particles, such that particles must be\npredominantly lifted by aerodynamic forces in steady state saltation. Owen further reasoned that, as a\nconsequence, the fluid shear stress at the surface must equal a value \"just sufficient to ensure that the\nsurface grains are in a mobile state,\" which he took as the impact threshold (\uf074it). Owen argued that, if the\nsurface shear stress falls below the impact threshold, fewer particles are entrained by wind. This in turn\nreduces the transfer of momentum from the fluid to saltating particles, thereby increasing the surface\nshear stress back to its threshold value. Conversely, if the surface shear stress exceeds the threshold value,\nmore particles are entrained, again restoring the surface shear stress to its critical value. That is, Owen\nhypothesized that\n(2.27)\n\uf074 a \uf0280\uf029 \uf0bb \uf074 it , or, equivalently\n\nu*sfc \uf0ba u* a \uf0280\uf029 \uf0bb u* it .\n\n(2.28)\n\n25\n\n\fThese equations can greatly simplify analytical and numerical studies of saltation and have thus been\nwidely adopted (e.g., Raupach 1991, Marticorena and Bergametti 1995, Sauermann et al. 2001, Kok and\nRenno 2008, Huang et al. 2010, Ho et al. 2011). Unfortunately, as we review below, there is strong\nevidence that Owen's hypothesis that the bed fluid shear stress remains at the impact threshold is\nincorrect and that its use can produce incorrect results.\nOwen's hypothesis rests on the assumption that splash plays a minor role in entraining surface\nparticles into the fluid flow. However, this assumption is inconsistent with the occurrence of saltation\nbelow the fluid threshold (Bagnold 1941), which indicates that splash is more efficient than direct fluid\ndrag in transferring momentum to surface particles. Moreover, a large number of wind tunnel experiments\n(e.g., Willetts and Rice 1985, 1986, 1989, Nalpanis et al. 1993, Rice et al. 1995, 1996, Gordon and\nMcKenna Neuman 2009, 2011) show that particles are splashed at impact speeds typical of saltation (~1\nm/s for loose sand on Earth; see Section 2.3.2.1). Implementing the results of wind tunnel measurements\nof splash into numerical models causes the fluid shear stress at the surface to decrease with the wind shear\nvelocity u* to values well below the impact threshold (Figure 2.10), contradicting Owen's hypothesis of\nEq. (2.28).\n\nFigure 2.10. Results from the physically-based numerical saltation models of Werner (1990) and Kok and Renno\n(2009a) indicate that the shear velocity at the surface (solid line and symbols) decreases with u* . These findings\ncontradict Owen's hypothesis that the surface shear stress stays at the impact threshold (dashed lines). The physical\nreason for the decrease of u*sfc with u* is discussed in Section 2.3.2.4.\n\nFurther evidence of the incorrectness of Owen's hypothesis is provided by measured vertical profiles of\nthe wind speed. Indeed, wind profiles simulated with Eq. (2.28) cannot reproduce the focusing of wind\nprofiles for different values of u* at a height of ~1 cm (Figure 2.9). This well-known feature of wind\nprofiles in the presence of saltation is known as the Bagnold focus (Bagnold 1936). In contrast, numerical\nmodels that do not use Eq. (2.28), and instead include a parameterization for the splashing of surface\nparticles do reproduce the Bagnold focus (Ungar and Haff 1987, Werner 1990, Kok and Renno 2009a,\nDur\u00e1n et al. 2011a, Ma and Zheng 2011, Carneiro et al. 2011).\n\n26\n\n\fOwen's hypothesis is thus inconsistent with laboratory measurements of splash, simulations of the\nwind profile by physically-based numerical models (Figure 2.10), the occurrence of the Bagnold focus\n(Figure 2.9), and, as we discuss in Section 2.3.2.1 below, measurements of the particle speed in saltation.\nWe thus conclude that Owen's hypothesis is incorrect, which has two important implications. First, the\nsurface shear stress does not remain at the impact threshold, but instead decreases with u* (Figure 2.10).\nAnd, second, particle entrainment in steady state is dominated by splash, not by direct fluid lifting (e.g.,\nAnderson and Haff 1988, 1991, Werner 1990). In the next few sections, we will show that the dominance\nof splash entrainment in steady state provides powerful constraints on the characteristics of steady state\nsaltation.\n\nFigure 2.11. Vertical profiles of the horizontal particle speed in steady state saltation from the wind-tunnel\nmeasurements of (a) Rasmussen and Sorensen (2008), (b) Creyssels et al. (2009), and (c) Ho et al. (2011) show that\nthe particle speed converges to a common value near the surface (see also Figure 2.12). This is reproduced by\nnumerical saltation models (panel (d) and figure 23 in Dur\u00e1n et al., 2011). All results are for particle sizes of ~250\n\uf06dm.\n\n2.3.2 Characteristics of steady state saltation\nSince particle entrainment in steady state saltation is dominated by splash, the number of saltating\nparticles lost to the soil bed through failure to rebound (Section 2.1.3.1) must be balanced by the creation\nof new saltating particles through splash. That is, the mean replacement capacity (Werner 1990) of a\nsaltator impact must equal unity. As is evident from Eqs. (2.10) and (2.14), the steady state impact speed\n27\n\n\fat which the replacement capacity equals unity is not dependent on u* (Ungar and Haff 1987, Andreotti\n2004, Kok 2010a, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011a). Consequencely, the mean particle speed at the surface must remain\nconstant with u* , which contradicts assumptions made in the seminal works of Bagnold (1941) and Owen\n(1964), but is strongly supported by measurements (discussed in the next section).\nThe independence of surface particle speeds with u* is a powerful constraint that can be used to\nunderstand and predict many of the characteristics of steady state saltation. Below, we discuss the particle\nspeed, the height of the saltation layer, the horizontal flux of saltating particles, the wind profile, and the\nsize distribution of saltating particles in steady\u2013state saltation.\n\nFigure 2.12. Wind tunnel measurements of the speed of ~250 \u2013 300 \uf06dm saltating particles (symbols) indicate that the\nmean horizontal speed at the surface stays constant with u* . Similarly, Namikas (2003) inferred from his field\nmeasurements that the speed with which saltating particles are launched from the surface is independent of u* (solid\norange line). Also included are COMSALT simulations with and without Owen's hypothesis (dashed green and\ndash-dotted blue lines, respectively), and the prediction of the theory of Kok (2010a) (dotted magenta line). (The\nlaunch speed and angle of ~0.70 m/s and ~350 inferred by Namikas (2003) were converted to a mean horizontal\nsurface speed by using that the rebound speed is ~vimp/2, and that the impact and launch angles are ~120 and ~350\ndegrees (e.g., Rice et al. 1995). Estimates of the surface particle speed in the wind tunnel measurements of\nRasmussen and Sorensen (squares and diamonds respectively denote measurements with 242 and 320 \uf06dm sand),\nCreyssels et al. (triangles, 242 \uf06dm sand), and Ho et al. (circles, 230 \uf06dm sand) were obtained by linearly\nextrapolating horizontal particle speed measurements within 2 mm of the surface. Error bars were derived from the\nuncertainty in the fitting parameters.)\n\n2.3.2.1 Particle speed\nAs discussed above, the dominance of splash entrainment in steady state saltation requires the mean\nparticle speed at the surface to be independent of u* . Since the mean speed of particles high in the\nsaltation layer can be expected to increase with u* , the vertical profiles of particle speed must converge\ntowards a common value near the surface. A range of recent wind tunnel measurements (Rasmussen and\nSorensen 2008, Creyssels et al. 2009, Ho et al. 2011), field measurements (Namikas 2003), and numerical\nsaltation models (Kok and Renno 2009a, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011a) confirm both these results (Figure 2.11 and\n28\n\n\fFigure 2.12). Note that the independence of surface particle speeds with u* cannot be reproduced by\nnumerical saltation models using Owen's hypothesis (Figure 2.12).\nAlthough the mean speed of particles at the surface thus remains approximately constant with u* , the\nprobability distribution of particles speeds at the surface does not. Indeed, increases in u* produce\nincreases in the wind speed above the Bagnold focus but decreases in wind speed below the Bagnold\nfocus (Figure 2.9). Consequently, the speed of energetic particles moving mostly above the Bagnold focus\nincreases with u* , whereas the speed of less energetic particles moving mostly below the Bagnold focus\ndecreases (Figure 2.13). In other words, the probability distribution of particle speeds at the surface will\nbroaden. In particular, the tail of very large impact speeds increases strongly with u* , which is offset by a\ndecrease in the probability of lower particle speeds (Figure 2.13).\n\nFigure 2.13. Probability density function of the horizontal particle speed at the surface of a bed of 250 \uf06dm particles,\nsimulated with COMSALT. Note that the high-energy tail increases sharply with the shear velocity.\n\n2.3.2.2 Height of the saltation layer\nSince particle trajectories vary widely (e.g., Anderson and Hallet 1986, Namikas 2003), there is no\nuniversal measure of the height of the saltation layer. However, since vertical profiles of the horizontal\nmass flux are commonly measured in wind tunnel and field experiments (e.g., Greeley et al. 1996,\nNamikas 2003, Dong et al. 2007), convenient ways to define the saltation layer height include the efolding length in the vertical profile of the horizontal mass flux (e.g. Kawamura 1951, Farrell and\nSherman 2006) and the height below which 50 % of the mass flux occurs (Kok and Renno 2008). The\nheight of the saltation layer is thus determined by (i) the distribution of speeds with which saltators leave\nthe surface, which sets the vertical concentration profile of saltators, and (ii) the mean horizontal saltator\nspeed at each height. As such, measurements of the saltation layer height can constrain theoretical and\nnumerical predictions of important saltation properties such as the mass flux and particle impact speed.\nEarly theoretical predictions of the saltation layer height zsalt assumed that the speed with which\nparticles leave the surface scales with u* (Bagnold 1941, Owen 1964), resulting in\n2\n(2.29)\nz \uf03d c u / 2g ,\nsalt\n\nz\n\n*\n\n29\n\n\fwith cz of the order of 1. However, as discussed above, advances in theory, numerical saltation models,\nand measurements have shown that the average speed with which saltating particles are launched from the\nsurface is approximately constant with u* (Figure 2.12), such that Eq. (2.29) is likely incorrect (P\u00e4htz et\nal. 2012). And indeed, field measurements of the saltation layer height (Greeley et al. 1996, Namikas\n2003) find no evidence of the sharp increase with u* predicted by Eq. (2.29). Instead, the field\nmeasurements of Greeley et al. (1996) and Namikas (2003) suggest that the height of the saltation layer\nremains approximately constant with u* (Figure 2.14), whereas the recent field measurements of Dong et\nal. (2012) suggest a slight increase in the saltation layer with wind speed (see their Figure 7). This latter\nresult is also what is expected from theory and predicted by models: although the particle speed at the\nsurface stays constant, numerical simulations and wind-tunnel measurements find that the particle speed\ndoes increase with u* above the surface (Figure 2.11). This means that the mass flux higher up in the\nsaltation layer increases relative to that in lower layers, producing a slight increase in the saltation layer\nheight with u * (blue line in Figure 2.14).\n\nFigure 2.14. Field measurements (symbols) indicate that the height of the saltation layer (defined here as the height\nbelow which 50 % of the mass flux occurs) stays approximately constant with wind speed, whereas classical theory\n(Bagnold 1941, Owen 1964) predicts a sharp increase (solid green line denotes Eq. (2.29)), which is thus incorrect.\nThe numerical saltation model COMSALT (Kok and Renno 2009a) predicts a more gradual increase in the saltation\nlayer height with u* , consistent with Dong et al. (2012) and the increase in above-surface particle speeds found in\nwind tunnel experiments (Figure 2.11).\n\n2.3.2.3 Saltation mass flux\nThe saltation mass flux Q, obtained by vertically integrating the horizontal flux of saltating particles,\nrepresents the total sand movement in saltation and is thus a critical measure for wind erosion and dune\nformation studies. Consequently, much effort has been devoted to formulating equations that effectively\npredict the saltation mass flux (e.g., Bagnold 1941, Kawamura 1951, Owen 1964, Lettau and Lettau 1978,\nSorensen 2004).\nThe saltation mass flux can be derived from the momentum balance in the saltation layer, that is, that\nthe sum of the horizontal momentum fluxes due to particles (\u03c4p) and the fluid (\u03c4a) equals the fluid\nmomentum flux at the top of the saltation layer (\u03c4) (Eq. (2.23)). Applying this relation at the surface yields\n(2.30)\n\uf074 \uf03d \uf072 u 2 \uf02du 2 .\np\n\na\n\n\uf028\n\n*\n\n* sfc\n\n\uf029\n\n30\n\n\fThe saltation mass flux is thus generated by the absorption of the excess horizontal wind momentum flux\nof Eq. (2.30) by saltating particles. The contribution q of a typical saltating particle hop to the mass flux is\nthe lengthwise mass transport per unit time,\n(2.31)\nq \uf03d mL / t hop\nwhere m is the particle mass, L is the particle's hop length, and thop is the duration of the hop.

(2.30), multiplied by the mass flux q (Eq. (2.31)) generated by a unit momentum\nflux p (Eq. (2.32)).

In particular, u*sfc is usually approximated with\n\nu*it , which, as we noted in Section 2.3.1, is incorrect and produces errors when implemented in analytical\nor numerical saltation models (Figure 2.9 and Figure 2.12). However, this approximation is more\nreasonable in this instance because when u* is close to u*it , we have that u*it \uf0bb u*sfc (Figure 2.10),\nwhereas when u* \uf03e\uf03e u*it , both u* \uf02d u*it and u* \uf02d u*sfc approximate u* .\nAnother assumption commonly made to simplify Eq. (2.33) is that the particle speed in saltation\nscales with u* , resulting in L / \uf044v \uf0b5 u* (Bagnold 1941). Using this assumption results in a scaling of Q\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\nwith u* , as for example proposed by Bagnold (1941), Kawamura (1951), and Owen (1964). However,\nmore recent studies have questioned the linear scaling of particle speeds with u* and thus the scaling of Q\n3\n\nwith u* (Ungar and Haff 1987, Andreotti 2004, Kok 2010a, 2010b, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011a, Ho et al. 2011,\nP\u00e4htz et al. 2012). As discussed in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.1, these studies are supported by recent\nexperimental, numerical, and theoretical results showing that particle speeds in steady state, transport\nlimited saltation are not proportional to u* (e.g., Figure 2.11 and Figure 2.12). Instead, the mean particle\nspeed at the surface is independent of u* , whereas the mean particle speed above the surface increases\ngradually with u* (as well as with height). The speed with which particles are launched from the surface\n(and thus \uf044v ) is thus independent of u* , and the saltation hop length is only a weak function of u* (see\nFigure 2.12 and Namikas 2003, Rasmussen and Sorensen 2008, Kok 2010a, Ho et al. 2011).\nWe can obtain a more physically realistic relation for the mass flux from Eq. (2.33) by neglecting the\nweak scaling of L with u* (e.g., Namikas 2003) and using that particle speeds scale with wind speed in the\nsaltation layer, which in turn scales with u*it. This yields L / \uf044v \uf03d CDK u*it / g , such that the mass flux can\nbe approximated by (Kok and Renno 2007, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011a)\n(2.34)\n\uf072\n2\n2\nQDK \uf03d C DK a u*it u* \uf02d u* it .\n\ng\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\nExperiments and numerical simulations suggest that, for ~250 \uf06dm sand, we have that L \u2248 0.1 m (Namikas\n2003), \u0394v \u2248 1 m/s (Figure 2.12), and u*it \u2248 0.2 (e.g. Bagnold 1937), such that the parameter CDK \u2248 5. We\nnow use Eq. (2.34) to non-dimensionalize the mass flux, which provides a convenient way to compare\ndifferent mass flux relations.

However, as u* increases, the wind speed higher up\nin the saltation layer will increase as well (Figure 2.9), thereby increasing the saltator impact speed. But\nsince the mean saltator impact speed must remain constant with u* (Figure 2.12), this increase of the\nwind speed higher in the saltation layer must be compensated by a decrease of the wind speed lower in\nthe saltation layer. Consequently, when wind profiles at different values of u* are plotted on the same\ngraph, the wind profiles intersect in the Bagnold focus at a height of ~1 cm above the surface for saltation\nover loose sand (Bagnold 1936). The wind speed below the focus, as well as the wind speed gradient and\nthus u*a , actually decreases with u* (Figure 2.9, Figure 2.10, and Figure 2.16).\nThe absorption of wind momentum by saltating particles acts as roughness elements that increase the\naerodynamic roughness length sensed by the flow above the saltation layer (Owen, 1964). The wind\nspeed above the saltation layer is thus determined by this increase of the aerodynamic roughness length\n(P\u00e4htz et al. 2012). Several models have been proposed to relate z0s, the aerodynamic roughness length in\n32\n\n\fFigure 2.15. The dimensionless saltation mass flux predicted by the relations listed in Table 2.1 (colored lines) and\nmeasured in recent wind tunnel (Iversen and Rasmussen 1999, Creyssels et al. 2009, Ho et al. 2011) and field (Li et\nal. 2010) experiments for sand with a diameter of ~250 \uf06dm. For the Sorensen relation, we used \uf061 = 0, \uf062 = 3.9, and \uf067\n= 3.0 from figure 3 in Sorensen (2004). The apparent overestimation of the mass flux by theoretical relations is at\nleast partially due to sand collectors having an efficiency of only ~50-90 % (Shao et al. 1993b, Greeley et al. 1996,\nRasmussen and Mikkelsen 1998).\n\nFigure 2.16. The wind speed profile at the fluid threshold (green line), the impact threshold (blue line), and during\nsteady state saltation (black line) as simulated by COMSALT (Kok and Renno, 2009a).

More recent physically-based models of the aerodynamic roughness length include Dur\u00e1n\nand Herrmann (2006a) and the P\u00e4htz et al. (2012) model, which uses the balances of momentum and\nenergy in the saltation layer to derive a physically-based expression for z0s. The various relations are listed\nin Table 2.2, and comparisons of some these relations with measurements are given in Sherman and\nFarrell (2008).\nTable 2.2. Relations for the aerodynamic roughness length in saltation. The relations of Dur\u00e1n and Herrmann\n(2006a, see their Eqs. 20 - 24) and P\u00e4htz et al.

The normalized size distribution of saltating particles from the field measurements of Namikas (2003,\n2006) at u* = 0.30 m/s, 0.36 m/s, and 0.55 m/s are similar to the soil size distribution (solid line). Saltating particle\nsize distributions were obtained by integrating the horizontal distribution of the saltation mass flux given in Figure 3\nof Namikas (2006).\n\n34\n\n\f2.3.2.5 Size distribution of saltating particles\nAs discussed in Section 2.3.1, after saltation has been initiated by the aerodynamic entrainment of surface\nparticles, subsequent lifting of surface particles occurs predominantly through splash. The fluid threshold\ntherefore has little influence on the physical properties of steady state saltation. In particular, the size\ndistribution of saltating particles is not determined by the dependence of the fluid threshold on particle\nsize, as many previous studies have assumed (e.g., Marticorena and Bergametti 1995, Shao et al. 1996),\nbut is rather determined by (i) the probability that a particle of a given size is splashed into the fluid\nstream, and (ii) the time the particle spends in saltation before settling back to the soil bed. The\nexperiments of Rice et al. (1995) indicate that particles with a larger cross-sectional area have a\ncorrespondingly higher change of being splashed by an impacting saltator. Conversely, larger particle\nhave short lifetimes because their high inertia causes them to attain lower speeds when splashed (Eq.\n(2.15)), leading them to quickly settle back to the soil surface (Kok and Renno 2009a). These two\ncompeting effects appear to result in a size distribution of saltating particles that is similar to the soil size\ndistribution (Figure 2.17).\nThe size distribution of saltating particles is thus primarily determined by the speed (or momentum)\nof impacting saltators. Since the impact speed of saltators remains constant with u* (Figure 2.12), the size\ndistribution of saltating particles should also be relatively invariant to changes in u* , as indeed indicated\nby field measurements(Figure 2.17).\nTable 2.3.

The impact threshold is defined here as the minimum shear velocity at which saltation can be sustained by\nsplash in the absence of direct fluid entrainment and can thus exceed the fluid threshold for saltation in dense fluids\nsuch as on Venus and Titan.\nc\nTypical saltation heights and lengths are defined as the mean height and length of trajectories of 250 \uf06dm particles\nthat have rebounded from the surface at least once, and are calculated with the saltation model COMSALT for a\nshear velocity equaling twice the minimum value for which saltation can be sustained (i.e., 2u*it on Earth and Mars,\nand 2u*ft on Venus and Titan). The lift-off speed of surface particles entrained by aerodynamic forces, which\ndominates over splash on Titan and Venus, was calculated using Eq. (26) and (28) in Hu and Hui (1996).\nd\nTrajectory calculations for Venus are consistent with the calculations of White (1981) and the experiments of\nGreeley et al. (1984).\ne\nThe calculated fluid threshold is consistent with the threshold of u*ft \u2248 0.036 m/s inferred by Tokano (2010) from\nthe orientation of Titan's equatorial dunes.\nb\n\n2.4 Saltation on Mars, Venus, and Titan\nAs discussed in the introduction, aeolian processes are not limited to Earth, but have also shaped the\nsurfaces of Mars, Venus, and Titan by creating dunes, ripples, and a plethora of erosional features (e.g.,\nGreeley and Iversen 1985). The characteristics of saltation on these planetary bodies differ from those on\nEarth and depend on factors such as gravity, air density, viscosity, and the properties of the granular\nmaterial being transported. Whereas terrestrial sand is composed primarily of silicon dioxide quartz with\na density of 2650 kg/m3, both martian (Yen et al. 2005, Golombek et al. 2006b) and Venusian (Greeley et\nal., 1991; Basilevsky and Head, 2003) sand is most likely predominantly basalt, which has a density of\napproximately 3000 kg/m3 (Johnson and Olhoeft, 1984). The granular material transported in saltation on\nTitan is rather different from that on Earth, Mars, and Venus, and likely consists of a mixture of ice and\n35\n\n\ftholins (organic heteropolymers formed by ultraviolet irradiation of organic compounds; Imanaka et al.\n2004, McCord et al. 2006), which has a density substantially lighter than basalt and quartz.\nLarge variations in gravity, air density, viscosity, and material density produce correspondingly large\ndifferences in the typical characteristics of saltation on the different planets (Table 2.3 and Figure 2.18).\nIn addition to large differences in typical particle trajectories, caused primarily by differences in the\ngravitational constant and the terminal fall speed (Figure 2.19), the fluid and impact thresholds differ\nsubstantially between the planetary bodies. Indeed, the ratio of the impact and fluid thresholds ranges\nfrom ~0.1 for Mars (Kok 2010a, b) to ~0.8 for Earth (Bagnold, 1941) to >1 for Venus and Titan. This\nimplies that the physics of saltation on Titan and Venus is fundamentally different from that on Earth and\nMars: whereas the lifting of surface particles is dominated by splash on Earth and Mars, it is dominated\nby direct fluid lifting on Venus and Titan. Indeed, the terminal fall speed of granular particles on Venus\nand Titan is less than the typical speed of ~1 m/s required to splash surface particles (Figure 2.19).\nBelow, we review the characteristics of saltation on Mars, Venus, and Titan in more detail.\n\nFigure 2.18. Predictions of the fluid and impact thresholds on (a) Earth, (b) Mars, (c) Venus, and (d) Titan. The\nfluid thresholds (solid lines) are calculated using Eq. (2.6) (Iversen and White 1982, Greeley and Iversen 1985),\nwhereas the impact thresholds (dash-dotted lines) are calculated with the numerical model COMSALT as the\nminimum shear velocity at which saltation can be sustained by splash (Kok and Renno 2009a, Kok 2010b).Wind\ntunnel measurements of the impact threshold were included for Earth conditions (symbols), whereas model\npredictions by Claudin and Andreotti (2006), Almeida et al. (2008), Kok (2010a), and P\u00e4htz et al. (2012) are\nincluded for Mars conditions. The effects of interparticle forces on the impact threshold were accounted for as\ndescribed in Kok (2010a), with the scaling constant of the interparticle force for Titan and Venus assumed equal to\nthat for Earth.\n\n36\n\n\fFigure 2.19. The terminal velocity of natural sand (Cheng 1997) on Earth, Mars, Venus, and Titan. Note that the low\nterminal velocity on Venus and Titan limits saltation particle speeds, thereby causing splashing to be inefficient.\n\n2.4.1 Saltation on Mars\nThe characteristics of martian saltation have been widely studied (e.g., Sagan and Bagnold 1975, White et\nal. 1976, Greeley 2002, Almeida et al. 2008, Kok 2010a, b) as a consequence of the observed abundance\nof dunes, ripples, and wind-abraded landforms on the martian surface (e.g. Greeley and Iversen 1985,\nBridges et al. 1999, 2010, Sullivan et al. 2005, 2008, Greeley et al. 2006). Moreover, dust devils and dust\nstorms are common on Mars (Thomas and Gierasch 1985, Cantor et al. 2001) and saltation is a likely\nmechanism of raising dust in these phenomena (Greeley 2002, Kok 2010b), although other plausible dust\nemission mechanism have recently been suggested (Merrison et al. 2007, Sullivan et al. 2008, Wurm et\nal. 2008) (see Section 4.2).\nThe typical size of saltating particles on Mars is still under discussion. Edgett and Christensen (1991)\ndetermined an average grain diameter of 500 \uf0b1 100 \uf06dm for Mars' dunes by relating the remotely sensed\nthermal inertia of martian dunes to the porosity of the granular material, and thus the grain diameter.\nLarger and smaller values were suggested in subsequent years (Presley and Christensen 1997, Fenton et\nal. 2003). However, Claudin and Andreotti (2006) more recently found d = 87 \uf0b1 15 \uf06dm from high\nresolution images of ripples' sand obtained in situ by rovers, although is it unclear what the applicability\nof this result at a single location on Mars is to the typical particle size of martian dunes.\n2.4.1.1 The puzzle of active martian sand transport\nA foremost open question is how commonly saltation occurs on Mars. Sporadic lander measurements\nsuggest that winds in the light martian atmosphere rarely exceed the saltation fluid threshold (Zurek et al.\n1992; Sullivan et al. 2000; Holstein-Rathlou et al. 2010), which is consistent with simulations of both\nmesoscale (Fenton et al. 2005, Chojnacki et al. 2011) and global circulation models (Haberle et al. 2003).\nThese findings are difficult to reconcile with recent reports of active sand transport at many locations on\nMars (Fenton et al. 2005, 2006, Greeley et al. 2006, Sullivan et al. 2008, Bourke et al. 2008, Geissler et\nal. 2010, Silvestro et al. 2010, 2011, Chojnacki et al. 2011, Hansen et al. 2011, Bridges et al. 2012a, Kok\n\n37\n\n\f2012), which in at least some cases results in sand fluxes that are similar to those on slow-moving dunes\non Earth (Bridges et al. 2012b).\nPart of the explanation for these seemingly contradictory findings might be that small-scale\ntopography and convection generate strong localized winds, which cannot be accurately simulated by\n\nthe coarse resolution of martian atmospheric circulation models (Fenton and Michaels 2010).\nMoreover, once such strong localized winds initiate saltation, recent results indicate that it can be\nsustained by wind speeds reduced by up to a factor of ~10 (Kok 2010a, b). That is, the martian impact\nthreshold is only ~10 % of the fluid threshold (see Figure 2.18b), thus allowing saltation to occur at much\nlower wind speeds than previously thought possible. The ratio of impact to fluid thresholds on Mars is\nlower than on Earth (Table 2.3) because the lower gravity and air density allows particles to travel higher\nand longer trajectories on Mars, causing them to be accelerated by wind for a longer duration during a\nsingle hop than on Earth (Kok 2010a). This effect combines with the lower atmospheric density on Mars\nto produce an impact threshold that is comparable to that on Earth (Figure 2.18). However, the lower\natmospheric density causes the martian fluid threshold to be an order of magnitude larger than on Earth\n(Eq. (2.5)). Consequently, the ratio of the impact to fluid thresholds is much smaller on Mars than it is on\nEarth (Table 2.3).\n2.4.1.2 Typical saltation trajectories on Mars\nThe trajectories of saltating particles on Mars are largely determined by the typical speed with which they\nare launched from the surface. Interestingly, the mean saltator launch speed during steady state saltation\nover a bed of loose sand is predicted to be very similar on Mars and Earth (Kok 2010a, b). The reason for\nthis is that the efficiency of the splashing process is essentially independent of the air density (Dur\u00e1n et al.\n2011a) and only weakly dependent on particle size and gravity. However, the lower gravity and vertical\nair drag cause martian saltators to undergo trajectories that are almost an order of magnitude longer and\nhigher than those on Earth (see Table 2.3 and Figure 3b in Kok, 2010b). These results contrast with the\nsubstantially larger saltation trajectory estimates of Almeida et al. (2008), who did not explicitly account\nfor splash. Since steady state on Mars is probably determined by splash entrainment, neglecting splash\ncan yield unphysical results, such as an increase in the saltator impact speed with u* (e.g., Figure 5 in\nAlmeida et al. 2008). The saltation trajectory estimates of Almeida et al. (2008) can nonetheless be\nconsidered plausible for supply limited saltation (Nickling and McKenna Neuman, 2009), for which\nsaltator impact speeds generally do increase with u* (Houser and Nickling 2001, Ho et al. 2011).\n2.4.2 Saltation on Venus and Titan\nAs discussed in the introduction, evidence of aeolian saltation transport has been observed not only on\nMars, but also on Venus and Titan. The characteristics of saltation on Venus and Titan are rather different\nfrom those on Earth and Mars because the much greater atmospheric density dissipates the vertical\nmotion of saltating particles (White 1981, Williams and Greeley 1994, Lorenz et al. 1995). This reduces\nthe typical height to which particles bounce to less than a centimeter (Table 2.3). Moreover, the\ndissipation of vertical momentum (Figure 2.19) makes saltating particles unable to access the larger wind\nspeeds higher in the saltation layer. Particles therefore cannot readily pick up large speeds as they do on\nEarth and Mars, such that splash on Titan and Venus is inefficient and particle lifting is done primarily by\ndirect fluid lifting. Saltation on Titan and Venus thus cannot be sustained below the fluid threshold (Table\n2.3) and is likely more similar to saltation in water (Bagnold 1973, Claudin and Andreotti 2006) than\nsaltation in air on Earth and Mars.\n\n38\n\n\f3. Sand dunes and ripples\nThe previous chapter reviewed the physics of wind-blown sand (saltation), while neglecting any changes\nto the sand bed. However, a flat sand bed exposed to a wind strong enough to set grains into motion is\nunstable. That is, saltation over an initially flat sand bed results in the generation of two kinds of\nbedforms with distinct length-scales: ripples, a few centimeters tall, and dunes, which are typically \uf035\uf02d\uf031\uf030\nmeters tall but can reach heights of a hundred meters. Dunes occur frequently as isolated objects moving\non a firm ground (such as barchan dunes in a corridor) but also as part of compounds evolving on a dense\nsand bed (see Section 3.1.5). Ripples appear most commonly on the surface of dunes as chains of small\nundulations that orient transversely to the wind trend (see Section 3.1.2). The physics governing the\nformation of ripples and dunes has been studied since the pioneering field works by Bagnold (1941).\nIndeed, many insights have been gained during the last few decades from computer modeling. With the\nhelp of computer simulations, it has become possible to reproduce in a few hours dune processes that take\nplace within decades or centuries.\nIn this chapter our aim is to highlight, from the point of view of physics, the progress achieved in\nunderstanding the formation and evolution of ripples and dunes on Earth, Mars, Venus, and Titan. A brief\nintroduction to the physics of ripples and dunes, including relevant insights into dune dynamics gained\nfrom field and experimental investigations, is given in Section 3.1. We then describe recent progress\nachieved from numerical modeling in Section 3.2. Finally, in Section 3.3 we discuss aeolian bedforms on\nMars, Venus and Titan.\n3.1 The physics of sand dunes and ripples\nAnyone who walked on a dune in a desert or on a windy beach has noted that the surface is armored with\nsmall undulations \u2015 sand ripples. Saltation is the primary transport mode responsible for the formation of\nboth dunes and ripples. However, these bedforms emerge from totally different types of sand-wave\ninstabilities, which will be discussed next in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. Many decades of field and\nexperimental works have pushed forward our understanding about the factors controlling the scale and\nmorphology of aeolian bedforms, which are discussed in Sections 3.1.3 \uf02d\uf0203.1.5. Dune dynamics are the\nsubject of Section 3.1.6.\n3.1.1 Dunes\nThe instability leading to dunes is of hydrodynamic origin. The presence of a bump or small hill on the\nsoil induces a modification in the logarithmic profile of the wind (Section 2.1.4.1). There is an excess\npressure at the upwind front of the bump, which acts as an obstacle to the wind. This pressure provides a\nforce that deflects upward the air flow approaching the bump from upwind. At the crest, a negative\npressure perturbation keeps the flow attached to the surface, in such a way that the flow streamlines get\ncloser to each other at the upper portion of the bump (Figure 3.1). The gradient of wind velocity is thus\nlarger at the crest than in the valleys, whereas the perturbation in the flow profile extends up to a height\nthat is of the order of the length of the bump (Fourri\u00e8re et al. 2010). The compression of the streamlines\ndue to the decrease of atmospheric pressure above the bump with an increase of the shear stress at the\nbump's top is a linear perturbation. This perturbation is symmetric with respect to the downstream crest\nposition (see e.g. Kroy et al. 2002). Indeed, the turbulent nature of the flow over the dune leads to\nnonlinear hydrodynamic effects in the shear stress perturbation (Stam 1997, van Boxel et al. 1999, Kroy\net al. 2002, Andreotti et al. 2002a, Fourri\u00e8re et al. 2010). In particular, the inertia of the turbulent velocity\nfluctuations introduces a resistance to the flow deflection over the bump that is not symmetric even for\nsymmetric bumps: it counteracts the upward deflection of the streamlines at the streamward side and their\ndownturn at the lee side (Kroy et al. 2002). Due to this nonlinear part of the hydrodynamic perturbation,\nthe maximum basal shear stress is not located at the crest. Rather, it is shifted upwind with respect to the\nprofile of the terrain (Figure 3.1). In the hypothetical situation where the sand flux responds without delay\nto wind velocity, maximum erosion would always occur upstream of the crest, such that sand would be\ndeposited on the bump, thus leading to dune growth.\n39\n\n\fFigure 3.1 Hydrodynamic instability leading to sand dunes. Schematic diagram showing streamlines of the wind\nflow over a bump of Gaussian profile in the direction longitudinal to the wind (solid surface). \uf074max and qmax indicate\nthe positions of maximum shear stress and sand flux, respectively. The saturation length, Lsat, gives the horizontal\ndistance of relaxation of the flux (q) towards its saturated value (qs) due to the variation in the wind flow along the\nbump's profile. The bump grows if the maximum flux is reached upwind of the bump's crest. After Kroy et al.\n(2002) and Fourri\u00e8re et al. (2010).\n\nHowever, the saltation flux takes a finite time \u2015 or, equivalently, a saturation length (Lsat) \u2015 to react\nto a variation of wind speed (Section 2.2). The bump grows only if its wavelength is large enough such\nthat the flux is maximal upwind of the bump's crest. The saturation length thus defines a minimum\nlength-scale for the growth of the bump and dune formation. Based on field observations and water tank\nexperiments on dune formation, Hersen et al. (2002) concluded that Lsat approximately scales with the\nquantity,\nldrag = d \uf072fluid/\uf072grains ,\n(3.1)\nwhere \uf072fluid and \uf072grains are densities of the fluid and of the sediments, respectively, and d is the particle\ndiameter. The flux saturation length Lsat is the only relevant length-scale in the physics of dunes: it\ndetermines the minimum size below which the bump is eroded and a dune cannot form. The physics\ngoverning the saturation length is still matter of debate (see Section 3.2.1.2 and 3.2.1.4).\nThe coupling between erosion-deposition and the hydrodynamics due to the nonlinear perturbation\ndescribed above results in an asymmetric dune profile with gentle windward slope and steep lee side. As\nthe dune grows and the surface curvature becomes very large, the negative pressure perturbation at the\ncrest does not suffice to keep the flow attached to the topography and flow separation occurs: at the lee of\nthe dune a zone of recirculating flow develops (Figure 3.2). Further, when the slope at the lee exceeds the\nangle of repose of the sand (~ 34\uf0b0) the surface relaxes through avalanches and a slip face forms. Dune\nmotion thus consists of saltating grains climbing up the windward side, accumulating on the crest and\nthereafter rolling down the slip face being deposited at the bottom on the lee side of the dune.\nSince the flow over dunes is fully turbulent with eddies at all length-scales, it has no characteristic\nlength-scale. The pressure perturbation around the bump is essentially a function of the surface shape,\nsuch that one expects the flow pattern to depend essentially on the dune shape but not on its size. Field\nmeasurements on barchan dunes (Sauermann et al. 2000, Andreotti et al. 2002a) show that, for large\nenough dunes, the shape of dunes is scale invariant. Scale invariance of dune shape is broken as dune size\nbecomes close to the minimal size \u2013 barchans close to the minimal size display less steep profiles than\nlarge enough barchans do and incipient slip face (Sauermann et al. 2000, Kroy et al. 2002). The breaking\nof scale invariance is thus a consequence of the flux saturation length, which dictates the onset for the\ngrowth of the bump into an asymmetric dune shape with a steep lee side and a separation bubble, as\nexplained above. Lsat is thus an essential ingredient for morphodynamic models of sedimentary\nlandscapes, i.e. models that incorporate a physical description of the interaction between the fluid and\nsediment bed leading to bedform formation (see Section 3.2).\n\n40\n\n\fFigure 3.2 Calculation of the flow over a barchan dune using CFD (after Herrmann et al. 2005). The image shows\nthe velocity vectors, colored by velocity magnitude (increasing from red to blue), over the cut along the symmetry\nplane of a barchan dune (in grey). The wind blows from left to right. The separation of the flow at the brink of the\ndune and the large eddy in the wake of dune are clearly visible.\n\n3.1.2 Ripples\nRipples are smaller than the saturation length, and in this manner they cannot develop from the\nhydrodynamic instability described above. Instead, ripples stem from a \"screening\" instability of the sand\nsurface exposed to the impact of saltating particles (Bagnold 1941, Anderson 1987a, Fourri\u00e8re et al.\n2010). Saltating grains colliding obliquely onto a sand bed generate small depressions on the surface,\nwhich then develop a chain of rough, small-scale undulations of asymmetric profile - the windward side\nof the perturbations is less steep than the lee side (Figure 3.3). Each collision may result in the ejection of\nmany reptating particles that move forward several grain diameters, while the impacting grain may\nrebound and land again at much larger distances. Indeed, the upwind side of each roughness element\nreceives more impacts of saltating grains than downwind surface areas, the so-called \"shadow zones\"\n(Figure 3.3). Ejected particles that reach the shadow zones are less likely to be impacted again by\nsaltating grains compared to particles on upwind surface areas, and in this manner sand accumulates in\nthe shadow zones leading to the growth of the perturbations. The role of saltating particles for ripple\nformation is to furnish energy to the motion of low-energy particles through reptation, in effect the\ntransport mechanism of ripples. The instability leading to aeolian ripples is thus controlled by grain\nimpact, rather than by hydrodynamics, which is the case for dunes.\n\nFigure 3.3 Sketch of the transport modes leading to ripple formation (after Prigozhin 1999). Saltating grains (dashed\nlines) impacting onto the sand bed eject several particles which enter reptation (solid lines).\n\nBagnold (1941) and Sharp (1963) first documented systematic field observations on ripples' morphology\nand migration speeds. Wind tunnel studies on the formative processes of ripples, conducted by Sep\u00e4ll\u00e4\nand Lind\u00e8 (1978), showed an increase in ripples' wavelength in time until a \"fully-developed state\" was\nreached without further growth. This saturated state was studied in detail in wind tunnel experiments by\n41\n\n\fAndreotti et al. (2006), who found a scaling for the final wavelength of ripples with the grain diameter\nmultiplied by (u\uf02a/u*it \uf02d\uf031) (but see Manukyan and Prigozhin 2009, Section 3.2.4.2). In fact, the time-scale\nof ripple formation is much smaller than the one of dunes. Therefore, ripples oriented transversely to the\nlocal wind direction on the surface of dunes provide an example of bedforms in the fully-developed state,\nand can be used for indirectly inferring local wind trends over the terrain (Andreotti et al. 2006).\n3.1.3 Aeolian versus underwater bedforms\nExperiments of dune formation under water provide a means to study the long-term dynamics of sand\ndunes (see Section 3.1.6.5). Much effort has been dedicated to understanding the different mechanisms of\ntransport and bedform dynamics under water (Fourri\u00e8re et al. 2010).\nImpact ripples (Figure 3.3) cannot form under water where the efficiency of saltating particles in\nproducing a splash of reptating grains is negligible compared to the aeolian case (Section 2.4). The\ninstability leading to underwater bedforms is of the same type as the one generating aeolian dunes\n(hydrodynamic); the relevant length scale is the flux saturation length (Hersen et al. 2002). Following\nFourri\u00e8re et al. (2010), underwater bedforms may be called \"ripples\" if their wavelength is much smaller\nthan the water depth, and \"dunes\" otherwise. According to this definition, dunes in a water stream are\nthose bedforms that result from amalgamation of ripples (Fourri\u00e8re et al. 2010). Subaqueous dunes have\nthus a similar origin as giant aeolian dunes, which grow progressively by merging of smaller dunes\n(Lancaster 1988, Andreotti et al. 2009). We note that, due to the large atmospheric densities of Venus and\nTitan, sediment transport on these planetary bodies is more akin to underwater transport than to sand\ntransport in air (see Section 2.4.2). As shown experimentally, Venusian microdunes behave similarly to\naeolian dunes or subaqueous ripples, rather than to aeolian impact ripples (see Section 3.3.3).\n3.1.4 Factors limiting dune size\nOne essential factor governing the long-term growth of dunes is the amalgamation of dunes (see Section\n3.2.1). Dune coalescence may lead to giant dunes several hundred meters in height, which often exhibit a\nmore complex morphology than their smaller companions and commonly host superimposed bedforms of\ndifferent types (Section 3.1.5.2).\nIndeed, the size of giant aeolian dunes is limited by the height of the atmospheric boundary layer\n(where sand transport takes place) in the same manner as the size of subaqueous dunes is bounded by the\nwater depth (Andreotti et al. 2009, Fourri\u00e8re et al. 2010). The topography of the sand terrain excites\nsurface waves on the interface between the inner layer and the free surface (which in the aeolian case is\nthe upper thermal inversion layer). The effect of these waves is to squeeze the flow streamlines\ndownstream of the bump's crest (instead of upstream as in Figure 3.1), thus providing a stabilizing\nmechanism (Andreotti et al. 2009). When dune wavelength (or interdune spacing in the case of a dune\nfield) becomes comparable to the thickness of the atmospheric boundary layer (which amounts to a few\nkilometers), this stabilizing effect becomes sufficiently large to prevent further dune growth (Andreotti et\nal. 2009). In rivers, the radiation of internal waves into the inner layer may not be as relevant as in the\naeolian case, and underwater \"mega-dunes\" of wavelength much larger than the water depth have been\nobserved (possibly in connection with polydispersity of sand; Fourri\u00e8re et al. 2010).\nIn fact, dunes of wavelength bounding the atmospheric boundary layer thickness are not typical of Earth\ndeserts (Bagnold 1941, Pye and Tsoar 1990, Lancaster 1995). Collisions between dunes, as well as\nvariations in wind direction by small angles, can also act as destabilizing factors for large dunes\n(Schw\u00e4mmle and Herrmann 2003, Elbelrhiti et al. 2005, 2008, Hugenholtz and Barchyn 2012; see\nSection 3.1.6.3). Such processes can lead to ejection of significant amounts of mass from large bedforms,\nfor instance in corridors of barchan dunes extending over hundreds of kilometers, thus hindering dune\ngrowth and helping to maintain the dune size well below the atmospheric boundary layer thickness.\n3.1.5 Factors controlling bedform morphology\nThe main factors determining the shape of aeolian bedforms are the wind directionality and the amount of\nsand available for transport (Wasson and Hyde 1983). When the wind blows from approximately the\n42\n\n\fsame direction most of the time and there is enough sand to completely cover the ground, transverse\nbedforms, aligned perpendicularly to the net transport direction, develop on the sand bed. Ripples on a\ndune provide a typical example of transverse bedforms. In areas where the amount of sand on the ground\nis scarce, unidirectional winds lead to barchan dunes. Barchans have a crescent-shaped form with two\nlimbs (also called horns or arms) that point in the migration direction. In many areas, the wind trend\nvaries seasonally between at least two main directions (Fryberger and Dean 1979) leading to longitudinal\nseif dunes, which have a characteristic meandering shape and align parallel to the vector resultant sand\ntransport direction (Tsoar 1983, Tsoar 1984, Livingstone 1989, Bristow et al. 2000). When multiple wind\ndirections become relevant, dunes become depositional centers thus developing a star-like shape that\ndisplays multiple arms radiating from a central peak. These star dunes can reach up to several hundred\nmeters in height (Lancaster 1989a, b). The aforementioned dune types, which are the four main dune\ntypes occurring in nature (Wasson and Hyde 1983, Pye and Tsoar 1990, Lancaster 1995), are illustrated in\nthe sketches in Figs. 3.4 a\uf02dd (top).\n\nFigure 3.4 The four main types of dunes occurring in nature. In the box on top we see sketches of barchans (a),\ntransverse dunes (b), longitudinal dunes (c) and star dunes (d). Arrows indicate the prevailing wind directions\ntypical for the formation of each dune type. Modified after Greeley and Iversen (1985). In the bottom we see\nsatellite images of: (e) barchans in Peru, near 15\uf0b007 S, 75\uf0b015 W; (f) transverse dunes in Bahrein, 25\uf0b049N, 49\uf0b055E;\n(g) longitudinal seif dunes at Bir Lahfan, Sinai, near 30\uf0b052N, 33\uf0b052E, and (h) star dunes in Algeria, near 30\uf0b035 N,\n2\uf0b051E. Images credit: Google Earth. The corresponding sand roses are also shown for each dune field. The length of\neach blue vector is proportional to the DP i value in the corresponding direction, while the red arrow gives the vector\nresultant sand transport direction and is proportional to the RDP value. The values of RDP/DP are (e) 1009/1034; (f)\n307/510; (g) 112/199, and (h) 95/686.\n\n43\n\n\fFigures 3.4e-h show aerial photographs of barchan, transverse, seif and star dunes with the\ncorresponding \"sand rose\" for each dune field. The vector length of each direction (i) of the sand rose\ngives the potential rate of sand transport from that direction, or the drift potential (DP),\n(3.2)\nDPi \uf03d \uf0e5U 2 \uf05bU \uf02d U t \uf05dfU ,\nwhere U is the wind velocity (in knots) at a height of 10 m, Ut = 12 knots is the threshold wind velocity\nand fU is the fraction of time the wind was above Ut (Fryberger and Dean 1979, Tsoar 2001). In fact, DP\nis related to the (potential) bulk sand flux while U and Ut are proportional to u* and u*t, respectively.\nThus, Eq. (3.2) for the potential rate of sand transport is consistent with the sand flux equation by Lettau\nand Lettau (1978) (see Table 2.1). The resultant drift potential (RDP) is obtained by calculating the vector\nsum of the drift potential for each of the directions of the sand rose. Wind directionality can then be\nquantified in terms of the ratio \uf062 = RDP/DP, where DP is the sum of the magnitude of the drift potential\nvalues for all directions. A value of \uf062 close to unity means unidirectional wind regimes, while \uf062 close to 0\nmeans multimodal wind systems.\n3.1.5.1 Experimental investigation of ripples in directionally varying flows\nRubin and Hunter (1987) designed an experiment to simulate aeolian ripple formation under bimodal\nwinds. A sand-covered turntable subject to a nearly steady wind of constant direction was periodically\nrotated by a divergence angle \uf071w. The table was held at one position for a time Tw1, then turned to the\nother position, where it remained a time Tw2, then turned back to the first position, where the process was\nrepeated in a cyclic manner. Ripples always oriented transversely (longitudinally) to the net transport\ntrend when \uf071w was smaller (larger) than \uf071L = 90\uf0b0. A \"mixed state\" was observed for \uf071w within the range\n90\uf0b0 < \uf071w < 112\uf0b0. \"Oblique bedforms\" occurred for obtuse divergence angle when the transport ratio R =\nTw1/Tw2 differed from unity (Rubin and Hunter, 1987). The experiments showed that bedform alignment is\nsuch that it yields the maximum gross bedform-normal transport \u2015 which is defined as the amount of\nsand transported normal to the bedform axis (Rubin and Hunter 1987). Gross transport means that\ntransport from opposite directions do not cancel, instead both contribute to build bedform surface. The\nprediction \uf071L = 90\uf0b0 has been confirmed in the field (McKee and Tibbitts 1964, Tsoar 1983, 1989, Rubin\nand Hunter 1985, Bristow et al. 2007, Rubin et al. 2008, Dong et al. 2010), in water-tank experiments\n(Rubin and Ikeda 1990, Reffet et al. 2010), and in numerical simulations of aeolian dunes (Werner 1995,\nReffet et al. 2010, Parteli et al. 2009, see Sections 3.2.1.4 and 3.3.2.2).\n3.1.5.2 The complex shape of giant dunes\nVery large dunes commonly display superimposed dunes of a different morphology \u2013 such dune\ncompounds are said to be complex dunes (McKee 1979). Examples of complex dunes are the giant\nlongitudinal dunes in Namibia, which host smaller superimposed transverse bedforms migrating obliquely\nto the main dune trend (Lancaster 1988, Andreotti et al. 2009). The origin of complex dunes is that\nbedforms of different sizes respond to wind regimes associated with different time-scales (see Section\n3.1.6.1).\n3.1.5.3 The role of stabilizing agents for bedform morphology\nSome natural agents can serve as sand stabilizers, thus greatly affecting bedform morphology. For\ninstance, in vegetated areas U-shaped parabolic dunes constitute the predominant dune morphology\n(Tsoar and Blumberg 2002; Section 3.2.3.1). Straight-crested, downwind-elongating linear dunes (where\n\"linear\" refers to dunes that are much longer than they are wide; see e.g. Rubin and Hesp 2009) can also\nform due to the action of vegetation, though the formative processes of these dunes are still poorly\nunderstood (Pye and Tsoar, 1990). Some authors hypothesized that sand induration or cementation by\nsalts or moisture in the dune could also lead to linear dunes elongating longitudinally to a single wind\ndirection (Schatz et al. 2006, Rubin and Hesp 2009; see Section 3.3.2.3). Furthermore, the presence of an\n\n44\n\n\fexposed water table may affect local rates of erosion and deposition and thus play a relevant role for dune\nmorphology and mobility (Kocurek et al. 1992, Luna et al. 2012).\n3.1.6 Dune dynamics\nThe large length scales involved in dune processes make the study of aeolian dunes in a wind-tunnel\nimpossible. Consequently, for decades, field studies have provided much of our knowledge on the physics\ndictating the morphodynamics of aeolian dunes (Livingstone et al. 2007).\n3.1.6.1 Scaling relations for barchan dunes and their consequences\nThe best-known type of dune is the barchan, which is also of particular interest due to its high mobility:\nbarchans can migrate between 30 and 100 meters in a single year (Bagnold 1941, Pye and Tsoar 1990).\nMany authors reported linear relations between barchan's width (W), length (L) and height (H) and also a\nscaling of dune migration velocity (v) with the inverse of dune size (Bagnold 1941, Finkel 1959, Long\nand Sharp 1964, Hastenrath 1967, Embabi and Ashour 1993, Hesp and Hastings 1998, Sauermann et al.\n2000, Hersen et al. 2004, Elbelrhiti et al. 2005).\nThe migration velocity of a barchan dune can be approximately calculated for a dune in steady state\nby applying mass conservation at the dune's crest (Bagnold 1941). The dune migration velocity scales as\nvm ~ cQ0/W, where c \u2248 50 (Dur\u00e1n et al. 2010). Since the barchan's volume V scales with W3 with a\nconstant of proportionality of about 0.017 (Dur\u00e1n et al. 2010), one can write vm \uf0bb kQ0/V1/3, with k \uf0bb 12.8.\nThe turnover time (Tm ~ W/vm) of a dune can be understood as the time scale needed for a sand grain,\nonce buried at the lee, to reappear at the windward dune's foot (Allen 1974, Lancaster 1988, Andreotti et\nal. 2002a). Tm follows the scaling relation,\nTm ~ aW2/Q\uf030,\n(3.3)\nwhere Q0 is the bulk sand flux and a \u2248 0.02 from field observations (Hersen et al. 2004). So the smaller\nthe dune, the shorter its turnover time, and thus the faster it readapts to a change in flow conditions.\nIndeed, the coexistence of dunes of different types associated with distinct sizes in an environment of\ncomplex wind regime (e.g. small transverse dunes occuring superimposed on or nearby much larger star\nor longitudinal dunes; see Lancaster 1988) can be understood on the basis of Eq. (3.3): sufficiently small\nbedforms can orient transversely to average wind directions that prevail for a short time-scale Tw\ncomparable to the turnover time of these small dunes (10 to 100 years); in contrast, the shape of much\nlarger dunes provides a proxy for changes in wind regime occurring within time-scales similar to their\nmuch longer turnover time (1000 to 100000 years). Consequently, the aforementioned scaling relations\nhave crucial implication for understanding the different shapes of dunes occurring in Earth and Mars\ndeserts and their connection to local variations in wind regimes occurring at a range of time-scales.\n3.1.6.2 Long-term evolution of dunes as proxy for climatic changes\nAs explained previously, dune dynamics respond to variations in wind regime, availability of mobile\nsediments and different factors that are influenced by local climate, such as vegetation cover. The shape\nof mobile dunes prevailing in a given field may change over time in response to changes in the local\nenvironmental conditions, with new dunes emerging superimposed on more ancient bedforms (Levin et\nal. 2007). Indeed, it is possible to infer information about past climates from the shape of fossil dunes\n(Lancaster et al. 2002). Also, knowledge of how dune dynamics react to climatic changes has potential\napplication to predicting the remobilization of currently inactive sand systems due to global warming\n(Thomas et al. 2005), or to infer information about the history of the Martian climate (Fenton and\nHayward 2010, Gardin et al. 2012).\n3.1.6.3 Collisions and wind trend fluctuations as factors for dune size selection\nChanges in wind regimes not only affect the shape of dunes but can also serve as a control mechanism for\ndune size in a dune field. Large barchans display in general small superimposed dunes (\"surface-wave\ninstabilities\") induced by variations in wind trend (Elbelrhiti et al. 2005). When subject to a storm wind\nblowing from a direction that makes a small angle with the primary wind, the dune's surface is unstable.\n45\n\n\fOn the windward side, small transverse bedforms with size of the order of the minimal dune occur, which\nthen migrate along the dune surface finally escaping through the limbs. This mechanism reduces the mass\nof large dunes, thus hindering the formation of a single giant dune through merging of all dunes in the\nfield (Elbelrhiti et al. 2005).\nA further factor relevant for dune size selection is the occurrence of collisions. Due to the scaling of\ndune velocity with the inverse of dune width, if a small barchan is migrating behind a larger one, a\ncollision will occur. Collisions between barchans in a corridor may generate small \"baby\"-barchans\nescaping through the limbs of large dunes (Schw\u00e4mmle and Herrmann 2003, Endo et al. 2004, Hersen\n2005, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2005) and could therefore also contribute to regulating the dune size. The respective\nroles of dune collisions and wind trend fluctuations for the stability of dune fields are currently a matter of\nsubstantial debate (Hersen and Douady 2005, Elbelrhiti et al. 2008, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2009, Diniega et al.\n2010, Elbelrhiti and Douady 2011, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011b).\n3.1.6.4 Further insights from field investigations\nExcellent reviews on field investigations of dunes can also be found elsewhere (Pye and Tsoar 1990,\nLancaster 1995, Livingstone et al. 2007, among others). Field observations provide the basis for\nconceptual models, as for example the model by Tsoar and Blumberg (2002) for parabolic dunes (Section\n3.2.3.1) or the model by Lancaster (1989a) for star dunes. The latter author suggested that a dune shaped\nby two opposite wind directions (i.e. a transverse dune of reversing type) may transform into a star dune\nwith four arms owing to leeside \"secondary flow patterns\", which lead to along-axis sand transport from\nthe sides towards the center of the dune. First, the secondary winds build two longitudinal arms, one at the\nwindward side and the other at the lee, whereupon the growth of the emerging arms is accentuated by a\nthird oblique wind direction. Conceptual models have also been proposed for the common occurrence of\nasymmetric barchan shapes, where one of the barchan limbs extends downwind, eventually developing\ninto a seif dune (Bagnold 1941, Tsoar 1983, Bourke 2010). Experiments or numerical simulations,\ndiscussed next, might be employed to test such models.\n3.1.6.5 Experiments under water as an approach to investigate (aeolian) dune dynamics\nWater tank experiments provide an alternative approach to study the long time scale processes of dune\ndynamics (Rubin and Ikeda 1990, Hersen et al. 2002, Endo et al. 2004). The major difference between\nsubaqueous and aeolian dunes lies in their scale. Owing to the difference between the fluid densities of\nwater and air (see Eq. (3.1)), underwater dunes are almost 1000 times smaller than their aeolian\ncounterparts. Hersen et al. (2002) designed an experimental set-up to produce unimodal water streams\nstrong enough to put glass beads, with size and density similar to those of desert sand grains, into\nsaltation. The experiments produced subaqueous barchan-like bedforms displaying nearly the same\nmorphological relations as those of aeolian dunes, thus suggesting that dune formation should not be\nstrictly dependent upon the details of the transport mechanism (Hersen et al. 2002). By using water tank\nexperiments, it has been possible to reproduce in the laboratory different dune morphologies appearing\nunder varying flow conditions (Rubin and Ikeda 1990, Hersen 2005, Reffet et al. 2010) as well as to\ninvestigate in a systematic manner the collision between barchans (Endo et al. 2004) and the formation of\na barchan belt emerging from a sand source (Katsuki et al. 2005). Water tank experiments have been also\nemployed as a means to test hypotheses on the origin of some extraterrestrial dune shapes (Taniguchi and\nEndo 2007; see also Section 3.3.2.2).\n3.2 Numerical modeling\nIn this Section, our aim is to present a summary of the progress achieved in our understanding of ripple\nand dune formation obtained from modeling. Two main modeling approaches can be adopted:\nmorphodynamic (continuum) modeling or cellular automaton (CA) modeling. In the morphodynamic\nmodeling approach, a mathematical expression is sought for the local mass transport of sediment over the\nsand bed (Anderson 1987a, Sauermann et al. 2001). Then, the rate of change of local bed elevation (h)\ncan be obtained from the divergence of mass flux (q) of sediments using the Exner equation,\n46\n\n\f\uf0b6h\n1\n\uf03d \uf02d \uf0d1 \uf0d7 q,\n(3.4)\n\uf0b6t\n\uf072b\nwhere \uf072b is the bulk density of the sand. In contrast, in a CA model for aeolian transport, physical\nprocesses such as erosion or deposition of sand are implemented by defining time-dependent stochastic\ninteraction rules between nearest-neighbors of a lattice. The topography of the sand terrain evolves\nthrough the individual transport of so-called \"sand slabs\" according to prescribed rules (Werner 1995).\nBelow we present a short description of the main morphodynamic and cellular automaton models for\ndunes and ripples and highlight the main achievements in the understanding of bedform dynamics\nobtained from modeling. At the end of the Section, a table is presented (Table 3.1), which displays a\nsummary of the main numerical models for dunes and ripples discussed in the subsections which follow.\n3.2.1 Morphodynamic (also continuum) model for aeolian dunes\nAttempts to develop a continuum model for aeolian dunes started in the eighties (Wippermann and Gross\n1986, Zeman and Jensen 1988, Stam 1997, van Dijk et al. 1999). Although none of these models was able\nto reproduce the shape of a migrating barchan, they provided the basis for the first successful continuum\ndune model by Sauermann et al. (2001) and Kroy et al. (2002), which has been further improved by many\nauthors during the last decade. In the following, the main ingredients for modeling aeolian dunes using\nthe continuum approach are discussed. At the same time, insights gained from continuum modeling into\ndune dynamics are highlighted.\n3.2.1.1 Wind field over dunes\nA surface with dunes introduces a perturbation in the shear stress profile over a flat ground.\nComputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have been employed to solve the Navier-Stokes\nequations of the turbulent wind over barchans and transverse dunes (Wiggs 2001, Parsons et al. 2004,\nHerrmann et al. 2005, Schatz and Herrmann 2006, Livingstone et al. 2007). Such an approach has been\nhelpful in elucidating the patterns of recirculating flow at the dune lee (Figure 3.2) as well as the\nmodification of the flow due to the presence of an array of many dunes. However, such calculations are\ntoo computationally expensive to be utilized in the framework of a continuum three-dimensional dune\nmodel.\nA more suitable, less computationally expensive approach consists of using an analytical model to\ncalculate the average turbulent wind shear stress field over the sand terrain. Such a model has been\ndeveloped in the course of several years (Jackson and Hunt, 1975, Weng et al. 1991), and has been widely\nused in dune models (Stam 1997, Kroy et al. 2002, Andreotti et al. 2002b). It computes the Fouriertransformed components of the shear stress perturbation ( \u20d7\u0302 ) in the directions longitudinal and transverse\nto the wind, whereupon the (perturbed) shear stress \uf074 can be calculated,\n\n\uf072\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf072 \uf072\n\n\uf072\n\n\uf072\n\n\uf029\n\n\uf074 \uf03d \uf074 0 \uf074 0 \uf074 0 \uf02b \uf074\u02c6 ,\n(3.5)\n\uf072\nwhere \uf074 0 is the undisturbed shear stress over a flat ground. Note that the shear stress formulation is a\nlinear solution of the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A consequence of this is that the shear\nstress perturbation is scale invariant: it only depends on the shape of the dune and not its size.\nThis analytical model works only for smooth heaps and gentle slopes. It does not apply for a dune\nwith a slip face, since it does not account for flow separation occurring at sharp edges and steep slopes.\nZeman and Jensen (1988) therefore suggested a heuristic approach by introducing a separation bubble at\nthe dune lee, which comprises the area of recirculating flow. For the purpose of calculating the flow at the\nwindward side of the dune, the wind model can be solved for the envelope,\nhs(x,y) = max{h(x,y),s(x,y)},\n(3.6)\ncomprising the separation streamlines (s(x,y)) and the dune surface (h(x,y)) (Figure 3.5). Then, at the lee,\nthe shear stress within the separation bubble, where the resulting net transport essentially vanishes, can be\nset as zero.\n47\n\n\fFigure 3.5 Average shear stress and separation bubble calculated over the profile of an isolated transverse dune. The\nshear stress profile, \uf074(x), appears rescaled with the upwind shear stress (\uf0740), while both the dune profile and the\nseparation bubble, h(x) and s(x), respectively, are normalized using the dune height (H). s(x) is a third order\npolynomial computed according to a phenomenological model (Kroy et al. 2002, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2010, see also\nPaarlberg et al. 2007).\n\n3.2.1.2 Continuum model for saltation flux\nIn addition to the shear stress distribution, a continuum dune model requires an equation for the mass\nflux, q(x,y), which is then combined with Eq. (3.4) to give the bed evolution. At this stage, many authors\n(Wippermann and Gross 1986, Zeman and Jensen 1988, Stam 1997) attempted to use an equation for the\nsaturated flux (qs), such as the one by Lettau and Lettau (1978), c.f. Section 2.3.2.3. However, the flux\nupwind of a barchan moving on the bedrock is well below the saturated value (Fryberger et al. 1984,\nWiggs et al. 1996). The simulation of a barchan using an equation for saturated flux therefore leads to an\nunphysical result: the decrease in wind strength close to the dune at the upwind causes deposition at the\nwindward foot (which is not observed in the field; Wiggs et al. 1996). The dune's foot then stretches and\nthe dune flattens. This problem was illustrated by van Dijk et al. (1999), who added to the saturated flux\nequation of Lettau and Lettau (1969) a phenomenological \"adaptation length\" to account for the distance\nover which sediment transport adapts to a new equilibrium condition due to a spatial change in transport\nconditions.\nThe continuum model by Sauermann et al. (2001) accounts for a physical modeling of the saturation\ntransients of the flux. The cloud of saltating particles is regarded as a thin fluid-like layer moving on top\nof the immobile bed. The flux is described by calculating the average density and velocity of grains\njumping with a \"mean saltation length\", whereas it is not distinguished between reptating and saltating\nparticles. The spatial evolution of the average height-integrated mass flux over the sand bed is computed\nby solving the following equation, i.e. the well-known logistic equation for population growth,\n(3.7)\n\u00d1\u00d7 q = \u00e9\u00eb1- q qs \u00f9\u00fb \u00d7 q Lsat ,\nwhere the saturated flux qs and the saturation length Lsat, which respectively scale with \uf05b\uf074\uf02d\uf074t\uf05d and \uf05b\uf074\uf02f\uf074t\uf02d\uf031\uf05d,\nencode the information on grain diameter, gravity, fluid viscosity and densities of fluid and particles\n(Sauermann et al. 2001, Dur\u00e1n and Herrmann 2006a, Parteli and Herrmann 2007b). It was shown that the\nminimal dune width Wmin in the simulations is around 12Lsat (Parteli et al. 2007a).\nSo the scaling of the saturation length in the model of Sauermann et al. (2001) includes a dependence\non the wind shear velocity which is not included in the scaling Lsat \u2248 2ldrag (see Section 3.1.1).\nExperiments show that the distance measured from the edge of a flat sand patch up to the horizontal\n48\n\n\fposition downwind where the flux is nearly saturated scales with the shear stress as predicted in the model\nof Sauermann et al. (2001) for Lsat (Andreotti et al. 2010). However, Lsat appears to be nearly independent\nof \uf074\uf020when q is close to qs. Hersen et al. (2002) proposed a simplified version of Eq. (3.7), where the RHS\nof this equation is replaced by (qs\uf02dq) / Lsat, with Lsat independent of the shear stress. There is an ongoing\ndebate about the modeling of the saturation length, and so we refer to ongoing research papers for a more\ndetailed discussion (Andreotti and Claudin 2007, Parteli et al. 2007b, Fourri\u00e8re et al. 2010).\n3.2.1.3 Avalanches\nThe continuum model then computes the bed evolution by inserting Eq. (3.7) into the mass conservation\nequation (Eq. (3.4)) (Kroy et al. 2002). Wherever the local slope exceeds the angle of repose of the sand\n(\uf071r), the surface must relax through avalanches in the direction of the steepest descent. Avalanches can be\nconsidered to occur instantaneously, since their time scale is much smaller than the time scale of dune\nevolution. Dur\u00e1n et al. (2010) presented a model of relatively fast convergence for computing avalanches\nat the dune lee.\n3.2.1.4 Model validation and contribution to understanding dune dynamics\nThe continuum dune model by Kroy et al. (2002) was applied successfully by Sauermann et al. (2003) to\npredict the average shear stress and flux profiles over the symmetry axis of a real barchan dune in\nnortheastern Brazil. It also reproduced quantitatively the three-dimensional shape of a barchan in\nMorocco (Figure 3.6).\n\nFigure 3.6 (a) Top view of a barchan dune produced with the model by Kroy et al. (2002); (b) a real barchan in\nMorocco; (c) longitudinal, and (d), transverse profiles at the respective crests of the simulated (continuous line) and\nreal (dashed line) barchans of panels (a) and (b). The profile of the dune was measured as described in Sauermann et\nal. (2000). Reprinted with permission from O. Dur\u00e1n and H. J. Herrmann, Modelling of saturated sand flux, Journal\nof Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment P07011 (2006). Copyright (2006) by IOP Publishing Ltd.\n\nAlso, important insights into the formation and dynamics of dunes and dune fields were gained using\nthe continuum model.\nIn particular, the simulations showed that collisions between dunes lead to different dynamics\ndepending on the volume ratio of the small and big dunes, r = Vsmall/Vbig. The dunes merge if r < 7%. If r >\n49\n\n\f25%, then sand from the larger dune downwind is caught in the wake of the smaller dune behind, which\nthen increases in size, eventually becoming larger (and therefore slower) than its downwind companion.\nBecause the dynamics resembles a small dune crossing over the larger one (Besler 1997), it has been illnamed \"solitary wave-like\" behavior of dunes (Schw\u00e4mmle and Herrmann 2003, Andreotti et al. 2002b,\nDur\u00e1n et al. 2005), whereas the simulation showed that in reality what happens is that large and small\ndunes simply interchange their roles through the net release of sand from the large dune to the small one\n(Schw\u00e4mmle and Herrmann 2003). For r between 14% and 25%, the collision results in the ejection of\nsmall \"baby barchans\" from the limbs of the larger dune downwind, whereas a further dune is realeased\nfrom the central part for 7% < r < 14% (Schw\u00e4mmle and Herrmann 2003, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2005). Indeed, the\nejection of small dunes resulting from collisions between dunes has implication for maintaining an\nequilibrium size distribution in barchan corridors (Dur\u00e1n et al. 2009, 2011b, see discussion in Sections\n3.1.4 and 3.1.6.3).\nFurthermore, by using an extension of the model to study dune formation under bimodal winds\n(Parteli et al. 2009) it was possible to reproduce many exotic dune shapes that occur on Mars (Section\n3.3.2). The simulations could also help to understand the meandering of longitudinal seif dunes \u2013 which\ndepends, as shown in Fig. 3.7, on the duration (Tw) of each of both prevailing winds relative to the dune\nturnover time (Tm).\nMoreover, application of the model to investigate the genesis and evolution of barchan dune fields\nfrom a sand source has yielded important insights into the origin of dunes under realistic conditions\n(Dur\u00e1n et al. 2010). It was shown that, when a flat sand sheet is subjected to a saturated sand influx, it\nbecomes a source for transverse dunes which emerge from sand-wave instabilities (see Section 3.1.1) on\nthe sand surface. The transverse dunes become unstable after reaching the bedrock (Reffet et al. 2010,\nParteli et al. 2011, Niiya et al. 2012, Melo et al. 2012) and decay into chains of barchans (Fig. 3.8). The\ngenesis of barchan dune fields has also been studied with inclusion of vegetation (Luna et al. 2009, 2011,\nsee also Section 3.2.3) and an exposed water table (Luna et al. 2012).\n\nFigure 3.7 Seif dunes formed under wind regimes with different angles between the two main wind directions\n(panels (a) and (b)), and for different values of the ratio tw of the wind duration and dune turnover times (panel (c)).\nLongitudinal alignment occurs for obtuse divergence angles. Straight dunes form when tw < 0.1%; meandering (seif\ndunes) occur for 0.1% < tw < 10%; beyond this range, transverse dunes with periodically reversing orientation are\nformed (Parteli et al. 2009).

Copyright (2009) by the National Academy of Sciences of\nthe USA.\n\n50\n\n\fFigure 3.8 Numerical simulation of the genesis of a dune field (Dur\u00e1n et al. 2010, Luna et al. 2011). The flat sand\nsurface upwind is subjected to a wind of constant direction. The instabilities occurring on the bed evolve into small\ntransverse dunes, which destabilize on the bedrock, decaying into barchans (Parteli et al. 2011). The average dune\nheight increases in size downwind due to the strong upwind flux (Luna et al. 2011).\n\nWhile the continuum model can potentially serve as a helpful tool in the quantitative assessment of\nplanetary dunes, some important limitations must be emphasized. One major issue concerns the modeling\nof the saturation length, Lsat. The saturation length of the dune model does account for inertia of the\ntransported sediments, which limits its application to small values of wind shear stress (Parteli et al.\n2007b). Indeed, due to the scaling of Lsat with (\uf074\uf02d\uf074t)-1, a rapid increase of the minimal dune size with\ndecreasing values of wind shear stress close to \uf074t is predicted. While measurements confirming this\nprediction are scarce (Andreotti et al. 2010), the physical processes leading to flux saturation are currently\nthe matter of substantial debate (Andreotti and Claudin 2007, Parteli et al. 2007b, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011b).\nMoreover, the dependence of the threshold friction speed of the wind on the local slope is not accounted\nfor in the model (Andreotti and Claudin 2007, Parteli et al. 2007b). One further issue concerns the model\nfor the separation bubble (Figure 3.5). For isolated dunes, setting the wind shear at the lee to zero might\nhave minor consequences for the barchan shape (Kroy et al. 2002). However, complex three-dimensional\nflow patterns at the lee could be critical for the dynamics of closely-spaced dunes (Parteli et al. 2006) or\nthe elongation of seif dunes (Bristow et al. 2000) and should be considered in future modeling.\n3.2.2 Discrete (CA) models for aeolian dunes\nWerner (1995) introduced the first cellular-automaton model for aeolian dunes. This model successfully\nreproduced, in three dimensions, all four main types of dunes encountered in nature: barchans, transverse\ndunes, longitudinal and star dunes. In Werner's model, sand is transported in the wind direction as sand\nslabs, as depicted in Figure 3.9. The model can be summarized as follows.\na) Transport algorithm - A sand slab on the surface is chosen at random and moves downwind to a\nnew lattice site l (typically equal to 5) sites away (Werner 1995). The slab is then deposited at the\nsite of arrival with a probability pd, if there is no sand there, or ps, if the site has at least one sand\nslab, where pd < ps in consistence with the observation that grains rebound on the bedrock with\ngreater likelihood than on a sand surface (Gordon and McKenna Neuman, 2009). If no deposition\noccurs, then the slab is moved again l sites in the direction of the wind until deposition occurs.\nNext, another slab on the surface is chosen at random and the process is executed again. As\nshown by Nield and Baas (2008a), the wind strength can be mimicked through adjusting the mean\npath length l/pd, where an increase/decrease in the probability of deposition pd means a\nlower/higher wind power.\n51\n\n\fAvalanches - If the slope becomes larger than 34o (a) due to deposition, then the slab is moved\ndown successively in the direction of the steepest descent, until all slopes are below the critical\nvalue; (b) due to erosion, then neighbouring slabs are moved downslope one lattice site, starting\nfrom the eroded site up the steepest gradient.\nc) Finally, a shadow zone (equivalent to the separation bubble, Figure 3.5) is introduced downwind\nof the surface covering the area enclosed by an angle of 15\uf0b0. Slabs entering this shadow zone are\ndeposited there.\nb)\n\nFigure 3.9 Sketch showing the main elements of the model by Werner (1995). Reprinted with permission from J. D.\nPelletier et al., Earth Surface Processes and Landforms 34, 1245-54 (2009). Copyright (2009) John Wiley & Sons\nInc.\n\nWerner's model has been applied as a tool for investigating the long-term evolution of dune fields\n(Werner and Kocurek 1997, 1999, Kocurek and Ewing 2005, Eastwood et al. 2011), and has been also\nimproved by many authors. For instance, Momiji et al. (2000) added the condition of no erosion within\nshadow zones, since net transport within the separation bubble is negligible (McDonald and Anderson\n1995). Also, a phenomenological non-linear equation for the transport length (l) was incorporated in order\nto account for the wind speed-up effect on the dune's windward side, c.f. Figure 3.5 (Momiji et al. 2000,\nBishop et al. 2002). These improvements led to dunes with more realistic, asymmetric cross-section\nprofile as compared to the triangular-shaped dunes of the original model (Werner 1995).\n3.2.2.1 Toward a physically based model for dunes\nIn comparison to morphodynamic modeling CA algorithms may offer simpler and computationally less\nexpensive numerical tools for simulating dune dynamics. One drawback of CA models is the lack of a\nphysical modeling of the sand flux and the wind profile, which is essential for the quantitative assessment\nof dunes. Length and time scales are not explicitly established in CA transport rules (Werner 1995), and it\nis also not possible to perform a stability analysis of dunes using this type of modeling (Narteau et al.\n2009). Recently, attempts were made to develop more realistic CA models through including quantitative\ndescriptions of the average turbulent wind profile or saltation flux. For example, the model by Zheng et\nal. (2009) considered a wind friction velocity (u\uf02a) that increased linearly with the surface height, while in\nthe model by Pelletier (2009), Werner's transport algorithm was coupled to a generalized version of the\nboundary layer flow model by Jackson and Hunt (1975). Narteau et al. (2009) introduced a threedimensional model in which the Navier-Stokes equations for the turbulent fluid were solved using a\nlattice gas cellular automaton model (LGCA). This model was coupled to a probabilistic sand transport\nmodel that considered the erosion rate proportional to the excess shear stress, \uf074 \u2013 \uf074t, thus accounting for\nthe exchange of momentum between particles and fluid that lead to flux saturation. The simulations\nproduced secondary (superimposed) bedforms on the surface of large dunes (Narteau et al. 2009, Zhang\net al. 2010), thus indicating the minimal dune size in units of elementary cells. Therefore, it was possible\nto set real length associated with the size of a unit cell from the (real) size of minimal dunes on Earth\ndeserts. As explained by Narteau et al. (2009), a similar procedure could be used in order to simulate\ndunes in other environments using the model.\n\n52\n\n\f3.2.2.2 Other models\nBesides Werner's algorithm, different phenomenological models with deterministic transport rules were\nproposed (Nishimori et al. 1998, Katsuki et al. 2005a). The model by Nishimori et al. (1998), which\nincluded gravity-driven creep flux and lateral diffusion, also produced different dune geometries\nconsistent with the imposed wind regime (c.f. Section 3.1.3). Katsuki et al. (2005a) introduced a simpler\nmodel including empirical deterministic rules for saltation flux on the windward side of dunes and\navalanches at the lee. This model was applied to study collisions between barchans (Katsuki et al. 2011)\nand the genesis of a barchan belt from a sand source (Katsuki et al. 2005b). Katsuki and Kikuchi (2011)\nfound that a field of barchans forms only if the sand source is subject to a large influx, which is in\nqualitative agreement with the findings of Dur\u00e1n et al. (2010), c.f. Section 3.2.1.4.\n3.2.2.3 Dunes as interacting particles\nInsights gained from continuum and CA models for dunes can provide basis for a different class of\nmodels where dunes are modeled as \"particles\" interacting according to phenomenological rules (Diniega\net al. 2010). Such models can be potentially useful to assess the long time-scale processes involved in the\nevolution of a field of barchans (Lima et al. 2002, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011b) or transverse dunes (Parteli and\nHerrmann 2003, Lee et al. 2005).\n3.2.3 Dune stabilization\nSome natural agents can act as stabilizers of dune sand on Earth and other planetary bodies. On Earth the\nprominent sand stabilizer (and the one most studied in dune modeling) is vegetation. In this Section our\naim is to describe the progress achieved from modeling in our understanding of the dynamics of dunes\nwith vegetation. We discuss stabilizing agents of dune sand on Mars and Titan in Sections 3.3.2.3 and\n3.3.4, respectively.\n3.2.3.1 Vegetation\nA conceptual model for the barchan-parabolic transition -Plants locally reduce the velocity of the wind\nblowing over dunes, thus inhibiting sand erosion and enhancing deposition (see Section 4.1.1.2). The first\nplaces colonized by vegetation are those where erosion or deposition is small, i.e. the dune's arms, crest\nand the surrounding terrain. Indeed, erosion is an important factor for the dying of vegetation, since sand\nremoval denudes the plants' roots and exposes deep layers to evaporation (Tsoar and Blumberg 2002).\nSince erosion prevents vegetation from growing on the windward side, the central part of a barchan or\ntransverse dune can still migrate while two marginal ridges are left behind. A barchan that enters a\nstabilizing vegetated area thus undergoes a transition to a U-shaped parabolic dune (Figure 3.10): its\nshape \"inverts\", after which the vegetated limbs point opposite to the migration direction. When the rates\nof erosion or deposition at the crest become sufficiently small, vegetation finally stabilizes also the central\npart and the dune is rendered inactive (Tsoar and Blumberg 2002).\nNumerical simulations - The first successful modeling of the barchan-parabolic transition (Tsoar and\nBlumberg 2002) was achieved by Dur\u00e1n and Herrmann (2006b), who extended the model by Kroy et al.\n(2002) to account for vegetation growth. The simulations indicated that the relevant parameter for the\ndune shape is the so-called fixation index (Dur\u00e1n and Herrmann, 2006b),\n\u2044( \u2044 ),\n(3.8)\nwhere Q0 is the saturated bulk sand flux, V is the dune volume and Vv is the characteristic growth rate of\nthe vegetation cover. The fixation index gives the ratio between the erosion rate, which is proportional to\nQ0/V1/3, and the vegetation growth rate, Vv. Dur\u00e1n and Herrmann (2006b) found that parabolic dunes form\nwhen \uf071 < \uf071 c (\uf0bb 0.5), while barchans appear for larger \uf071\uf020\uf028Dur\u00e1n and Herrmann 2006b). This prediction\nroughly matches field observations (Reitz et al. 2010), and good quantitative agreement is found between\nthe shape of real and simulated parabolic dunes (Dur\u00e1n et al., 2008). Using the same model, Luna et al.\n\n53\n\n\f(2011) found that a sand beach evolves into a vegetated sand barrier (or \"foredune\", c.f. Hesp, 1989),\nrather than into a field of barchans, when \uf071 \uf03c\uf020\uf030\uf02e\uf031.\n\nFigure 3.10 Deactivation of sand dunes due to vegetation growth.

Copyright (2006) by the American Physical Society.\n\nIn an earlier (and simpler) model, Nishimori and Tanaka (2001) extended the algorithm of Nishimori\net al. (1998) to include a phenomenological vegetation cover density with growth rate depending on local\nerosion and deposition rates. Geometries resembling barchans (parabolic dunes) were obtained for strong\n(weak) winds, i.e. for long (short) hop length of the slabs (Nishimori and Tanaka 2001), essentially the\ninformation encoded in Eq. (3.8). Also, Baas (2002) extended Werner's model (Section 3.2.2) by adding a\nvegetation cover density, which linearly altered the probability of erosion at a given cell. Again, the\nvegetation growth rate depended on the local rates of erosion and deposition (Dur\u00e1n and Herrmann\n2006b, Nishimori and Tanaka 2001). The barchan-parabolic transition was achieved by allowing different\nvegetation species (each associated with a maximum growth velocity and response rate to changes in\nerosion or deposition) to grow concurrently: pioneer species slowed down the flanks (first) for the\nstabilizer species to subsequently immobilize the edges into depositional ridges (Baas and Nield, 2007).\nModeling has been used to investigate the evolution of large sand systems in response to variations in\nvegetation growth due to climatic changes (Nield and Baas, 2008b) or altitude-induced changes in soil\nfertility (Pelletier et al. 2009). In some places, barchans and parabolic dunes can even coexist under the\nsame climatic conditions. This can be understood by noting that dunes with different sizes have different\nfixation indices (Eq. (3.8)). Yihzaq et al. (2007) proposed a simple mathematical model that elucidates\nthis bistability phenomenon. For moderate wind power condition, both barchans and parabolic dunes can\nform, while the former (latter) prevail for high (low) wind power (Yihzaq et al. 2007).\n3.2.4 Models for aeolian ripples in single-grain-sized beds\nSignificant understanding of the physics of aeolian ripples was achieved through the work of Anderson\n(1987a). Anderson's revolutionary continuum model is in contrast with Bagnold's picture of a rhythmic\nbarrage of grains saltating from one ripple to another (Bagnold 1941, Ellwood et al. 1975; see also\nmodeling using this picture, e.g. Nishimori and Ouchi 1993, Kurtze et al. 2000, Miao et al. 2001, Kang\nand Guo 2004). It is based on the assumption that reptation, rather than saltation, is the transport\nmechanism through which ripples form and move. Saltating grains only provide the energy necessary for\ninitiating and maintaining reptation.\nA flat sand bed with a small periodic perturbation in the wind direction (x) is exposed to a\nhorizontally uniform saltation flux,\nqsal \uf03d mN\uf06c ,\n(3.9)\n54\n\n\fwhere m is the particle mass, N is the impact rate and \uf06c is the mean saltation trajectory length. A flux qrep\nof reptating particles is produced by the impacts. After entrainment, a reptating grain travels a distance a\n(with probability density p(a)da and average \uf0e1a\uf0f1) before landing. The average mass flux of reptating\ngrains is written as,\n(3.10)\nqrep \uf03d mNn a ,\nwhere n is the average number of particles ejected upon impact. Importantly, the stoss side is more\nexposed to grain impacts than the lee area (Figure 3.3). By including this asymmetry of impact rate in the\nmodel, Anderson (1987a) arrived at an expression for the mass flux (q(x)) per unit width across the plane\nperpendicular to the flow, which is valid in the limit of small perturbations,\n\uf0a5\n\nq( x) \uf03d qsal \uf02b qrep \uf02b mNn cot \uf061 \uf0f2 \uf05bh( x) \uf02d h( x \uf02d a)\uf05d p(a)da ,\n\n(3.11)\n\n0\n\nwhere \uf061\uf020is the impact angle, defined positively when the descent is inclined downwind (Anderson 1987a).\nThe flux is thus largest at those areas where the bed slopes most steeply upwind, and is smallest in the lee\nareas (shadow zones), thereby causing the ripple to migrate upwind. A linear stability analysis of the\nmodel yields a preferred wavelength which is about six times the mean reptation length (Anderson\n1987a), in agreement with the initial wavelength observed in wind tunnel experiments on ripple formation\n(Sep\u00e4ll\u00e4 and Lind\u00e8 1978).\nAnderson's model for initial ripple growth served as the basis for later models (summarized below),\nwhich were developed to study the long-term evolution of ripples.\n3.2.4.1 Cellular automaton models of aeolian ripples\nForrest and Haff (1992) introduced a discrete cellular automaton simulation following the trajectory of\neach moving particle. The initial ripples grew from the spatial asymmetry in the flux of impacting grains\n(screening instability) in agreement with Anderson (1987a). In the nonlinear regime of the bed evolution,\nmerging of ripples automatically filtered out ripples of significantly different sizes (e.g., Anderson 1990).\nForrest and Haff (1992) suggested that bedform merging should play a major role for attaining a fullydeveloped state of ripples with constant size and spacing after a long time.\nThis hypothesis was explored in a toy-model introduced by Werner and Gillespie (1993), in which\nripples were represented as one-dimensional entities (\"worms\") of different lengths moving around a\ndiscretized ring of N segments. The head of each \"ripple\" moved one segment clockwise with probability\ninversely proportional to its length, thereby absorbing one segment of the \"downwind ripple\". Without\nany account for the detailed physics of ripples, the \"worm\" model (as well as its two-dimensional version)\nproduced a logarithmic increase of \"ripple\" size with time (Werner and Gillespie 1993). Landry and\nWerner (1994) then introduced a three-dimensional model including a slope-dependent reptation length\n(Werner and Haff 1988) as well as rolling: after landing, the particle moved down the steepest descent\n(with a prescribed \"pseudomomentum\") until halting on a stable pocket on the granular bed. Bedform\nspacing grew at a decreasing rate with time, however without indication of a steady-state value for the\nmean height and spacing of ripples (Landry and Werner 1994).\nIn a different approach, Pelletier (2009) applied an improved version of Werner's dune model\n(Section 3.2.2) to ripple dynamics. Pelletier (2009) interpreted the (smaller) bedforms in the simulations\nas ripples, which then provided the roughness elements for simulations of dunes. Both ripples and dunes\nachieved a constant size and spacing, both increasing functions of grain size and excess shear stress\n(Andreotti et al. 2006). As explained by the author, this steady-state occurred because of the correction of\nthe migration velocity of taller bedforms: taller dunes, subjected to larger values of bed shear stress\n(Figure 3.5), migrated a little faster than in the original model by Werner (1995). In this manner, the\nmodel produced a smaller rate with which small and tall dunes merge, compared to the original Werner's\nmodel, eventually achieving a nearly stationary state where ripple spacing remained constant (Pelletier\n2009). The author's findings suggested an intriguing genetic linkage between ripples and dunes via the\nscaling between bedform size and aerodynamic roughness. Such a model however differs from\n55\n\n\fAnderson's picture, since it assumes that saltation (rather than reptation) is the transport mode for ripple\nmigration (Werner 1995).\n3.2.4.2 Continuum models of aeolian ripples\nPrigozhin (1999), following Anderson (1990), improved the continuum model of Anderson (1987a) by\nallowing reptating grains to roll a certain distance upon landing, due to the action of gravity. The flux of\nrolling particles was described using the so-called BCRE theory of surface flow of granular materials over\na static sand bed, which was introduced by Bouchaud et al. (1994) for avalanche flows in sandpiles and\nadapted by Terzidis et al. (1998) to the problem of ripple instability. An alternative model for rolling was\nalso proposed by Hoyle and Woods (1997) and Hoyle and Mehta (1999). These authors and Prigozhin\n(1999) studied numerically the nonlinear regime of ripples growth (see also the theoretical works by\nValance and Rioual (1999) and Misbah and Valance (2003)).\nTowards a fully-developed state - Following Prigozhin (1999), Yizhaq et al. (2004) introduced a\nphenomenological correction that made the reptation flux slightly larger on the lee side. This correction\nartificially shifted the largest flux value closer to the ripple's crest, thus acting to limit the growth of the\nripples. After a sufficiently long simulation time, the system apparently approached a saturated (fullydeveloped) state with nearly constant ripple size (Andreotti et al. 2006). In an improved version of\nPrigozhin's model, rolling occurred not only due to gravity but also due to aeolian drag (Manukyan and\nPrigozhin 2009). This model also accounted for mass exchange between the bed and the saltation cloud\n(Sauermann et al. 2001). Erosion of ripple crests and deposition in throughs produced much more flat\nripples than those obtained previously (Manukyan and Prigozhin 1999). These numerical simulations\nprovided convincing evidence that the saturation of ripple growth (Andreotti et al. 2006) occurs due to\nremoval of sand from crests into throughs due to the action of the wind, as suggested by Bagnold (1941).\nManukyan and Prigozhin (1999) also suggested that ripples produced in a wind tunnel longer than the\nsaturation length should display both size and spacing independent of wind strength. This prediction\nremains to be confirmed experimentally (Andreotti et al. 2006).\n3.2.4.3 Models for (granule) ripples in a bed with mixed sand sizes\nIn sand beds with two grain sizes, ripples in general display coarse-grained crests, while in their inner\nparts and in the troughs smaller grains dominate (Sharp 1963, Hunter 1977). Ripples displaying this socalled 'inverse grading' have been named granule ripples or megaripples as they may achieve much\nlarger wavelengths than ripples of uniform sand (Sharp 1963, Ellwood et al. 1975, Tsoar 1990, Fryberger\net al. 1992, Sullivan et al. 2005, Jerolmack et al. 2006, Isenberg et al. 2011).\nAnderson and Bunas (1993) introduced the first model for aeolian ripples incorporating two grain\nsizes. Their model included a phenomenological description of the wind flow around the evolving\ntopography, such as to produce a horizontally uniform wind speed above a 'ceiling height', roughly one\nripple wavelength above the mean surface altitude. The trajectory of the reptating particles was different\nfor coarse and fine grains: since smaller grains can jump higher, they are subjected to larger wind\nvelocities, thus experiencing larger acceleration and hopping further. Small particles, once ejected from\nthe ripples' crest, can jump trajectories long enough to land in the throughs. In contrast, coarse grains do\nnot hop far enough to escape the lee, thus accumulating around the crest; after being buried during\nmigration of the ripple, they reappear on the stoss surface, thereafter skittering up the crest to repeat the\nprocess. The difference in jump lengths for coarse and fine grains thus provides an explanation for sorting\nand \"inverse grading\" of granule ripples (Werner et al. 1986).\nFollowing these findings, Makse (2000) extended previous continuum modeling (Terzidis et al. 1998,\nPrigozhin 1999) to include a two-species model where coarse grains jumped shorter trajectories than\nsmaller ones; and Manukyan and Prigozhin (2009) also adapted their model (Section 3.2.4.2) to account\nfor two grain sizes. The latter study showed that megaripples with larger grain-size ratios (of the order of\n5) than those considered in previous models (Anderson and Bunas 1993, Makse 2000) can be obtained by\naccounting for wind-induced motion of the coarse particles armoring the ripple crests (Manukyan and\n56\n\n\fTable 3.1: Summary of the most important models for aeolian dunes, ripples and granule ripples or megaripples.\nModel type may be morphodynamic (\"M\"), cellular automaton (\"CA\") or bedforms as interacting particles (\"IP\").\n\nModel\n\nType Description\n\nComments; summary of further\nimprovements\n\nSauermann et al.

Yizhaq (2004) also extended the model by Yizhaq et al. (2004) to describe two types of\nsand flux, namely reptation of coarse grains and saltation of fines. This model links the wavelength of\nmegaripples not to reptation, as in Anderson's model, but to saltation, as suggested by Bagnold (1941).\nOther recent attempts to model granule ripples considered directly solving the Navier-Stokes\nequations for the wind flow over the topography (Wu et al. 2008, Zheng et al. 2008). One particular\nmodel (Zheng et al. 2008), which considered three grain sizes, produced coarse-crested ripples as\nobserved in nature and simulations. The model supported the conclusion that inverse grading of granule\nripples results from the dependence of reptation length on grain size (Anderson and Bunas 1993).\n3.3 Dunes and ripples on Mars and other planetary bodies\nThe study of bedform dynamics on extraterrestrial planets has become a field of broad interest for Earth\nand planetary scientists (Bourke et al. 2010). The occurrence and shape of ripples and dunes in an\nextraterrestrial field can potentially yield indirect information about local wind regimes as well as about\nphysical attributes of the constituting sediments. Our knowledge about dune morphodynamics on Mars,\nVenus and Titan is moving forward every new mission with the acquisition of images from satellites and\nrovers with progressively higher resolution. Furthermore, numerical modeling and comparison of the\nobserved bedforms with terrestrial analogs have provided valuable insights into the transport processes\nleading to dunes in diverse extraterrestrial deserts.\nIn Section 3.3.1 we discuss important advances achieved through missions observations in the\nresearch of Martian aeolian bedforms. Also, much of our current understanding of dune formation on\nMars has been gained through numerical modeling as described in Section 3.3.2. Some highlights of the\nresearch on Venus and Titan dunes are presented in Sections 3.3.3 and 3.3.4, respectively.\n3.3.1 Aeolian bedforms on Mars: observations from orbiters and landers\nSand dunes and ripples are amongst the most ubiquitous geological features on the surface of Mars\n(Bourke et al. 2010). Ripple formation or migration has been detected at practically all locations where\nrovers successfully landed (Arvidson et al. 1983, Moore 1985, Sullivan et al. 2005, 2008, Jerolmack et al.\n2006). In some areas, changes on dune surface or net migration of dunes could be detected from satellite\ncoverage (Fenton 2006, Bourke et al. 2008, Silvestro et al. 2010, 2011, Hansen et al. 2011, Chojnacki et\nal. 2011, Bridges et al. 2012a).\nMost martian dune fields occur in the northern polar region and also on the floors of craters, which\nmay act as traps for wind-blown sediments (Bridges et al. 2012). Craters may also contain sublayers of\ndark sediments \uf0be in general of volcanic origin and formed prior to the epoch of meteorite bombardments\n(Tirsch et al. 2011) \uf0be which are susceptible to wind erosion thus constituting sources for dunes sand.\nSince the first images of dunes by Mariner 9 (Sagan et al. 1972, Cutts and Smith 1973, McCauley 1973)\nsignificant progress in the understanding of dune processes on Mars has been made. Because barchans\nand transverse dunes were the prominent dune morphologies imaged by early missions, it has been\nsuggested that sand-moving winds of Mars are predominantly unidirectional (Lee and Thomas, 1995).\nHowever, more recent orbiters' images showed a diversity of unusual dune shapes which could not form\nunder constant wind direction (Schatz et al. 2006, Parteli and Herrmann 2007a, Hayward et al. 2007). The\npossibility that their constituent sand is indurated (Section 3.3.2.3) and the relative scarceness of dune\nactivity observed on the red planet (compared to the Earth) raised the question of whether dune formation\noccurs on present day Mars or whether the martian dunes were formed during past climates with a denser\natmosphere (Breed et al. 1979). Recent modeling and experimental works (Section 3.3.2) shed some light\non formative processes of martian dunes.\nA type of aeolian bedform called Transverse Aeolian Ridges (TARs) could not be classified as ripples\nor dunes (Thomas et al. 1999, Malin and Edgett 2001, Bourke et al. 2003, Wilson and Zimbelman 2004,\nBalme et al. 2008, Zimbelman 2010, Berman et al. 2011). TARs, found in almost all martian geologic\nsettings, are of intermediate size between ripples and dunes, seem to align normal to local winds, and\ncommonly share albedo with the surrounding terrain (Malin and Edgett 2001). TARs that are brighter\nthan the surrounding terrain appear mostly underneath large dark dunes of various morphologies where\n58\n\n\fthese two bedform types occur together. These bright TARs were possibly formed by winds of a past\nclimate (Thomas et al. 1999). A possible explanation for their low albedo is that the TARs are covered in\nbright dust because they are less active than the surrounding, large dunes. In some areas, dark TARs occur\nsuperimposed on the lower parts of dunes, suggesting a linkage between martian dark TARs and Earth's\ncoarse-crested granule ripples (Balme et al. 2008; see Section 3.2.4.3). The coexistence of these TARs\ntogether with larger dunes of complex morphologies can be understood by recalling the concept of\nturnover time (Section 3.1.6.1): being smaller, TARs have a smaller value of Tm thus aligning transversely\nto the prevailing wind while the larger dunes provide a proxy for local wind directions on a longer time\nscale.\n3.3.2 Dune formation on Mars: insights from modeling and experiments\nThe quantitative study of martian dune formation requires modeling studies that account for the attributes\nof sediment and atmosphere in an arbitrary planetary environment.\n\nFigure 3.11 Numerical simulations and water tank experiments of dune formation under various flow conditions\nprovided insights into the formative wind regimes of diverse martian dune shapes: (a) Barchan dunes of different\nsizes at Arkhangelsky crater (left) together with the corresponding shapes obtained in numerical simulations (right)\naccounting for the attributes of sand and atmosphere of Mars (after Parteli and Herrmann 2007a). The arrow\nindicates the wind direction; (b) \"wedge\" dune at Wirtz crater (left) and martian dune simulated by Parteli and\nHerrmann (2007a) (right) using a bimodal wind regime with divergence angle \uf071w =100\uf0b0 (arrows indicate the\nalternating wind directions); (c) straight martian longitudinal dunes (left) could be reproduced in numerical\nsimulations (top-right; after Parteli and Herrmann 2007a) and water tank experiments (bottom-right; after Reffet et\nal. 2010) under a bimodal wind regime with \uf071w = 120\uf0b0; (d) barchans with deformed limbs resembling those at\nProctor crater (left) were obtained in water tank experiments by Taniguchi and Endo (2007) (right) using a reversing\nflow condition where the velocity of the secondary wind was about 75% the primary wind's speed. Images courtesy\nof NASA/JPL/MSSS.\n\n3.3.2.1 The shape of intra-crater barchans\nParteli et al. (2005, 2007a) presented the first calculation of the shape of barchan dunes at Arkhangelsky\ncrater on Mars (Figure 3.11a). The simulations used the model by Kroy et al. (2002) considering a grain\ndiameter d = 500 \uf06dm (Edgett and Christensen 1991, see also Section 2.4) and wind speeds larger than the\ncorresponding threshold for direct entrainment under martian conditions, i.e. u\uf02aft = \uf032\uf02e\uf030\uf02d\uf032\uf02e\uf035 m/s (Parteli et\nal. 2007a). A value of impact threshold u*t = 0.8 u\uf02aft (\uf0bb 2.0 m/s) was used in analogy with saltation on\nEarth (Bagnold 1941) (although more recent simulations and theoretical models have suggested a\nsubstantially lower ratio u*it\uf02fu*ft for Mars; Almeida et al. 2008, Kok 2010a, 2010b, P\u00e4htz et al. 2012; see\n59\n\n\fSection 2.4). From the minimal dune width (Wmin), which scales with \uf031\uf02f[\uf074\uf02f\uf074t \uf02d\uf031\uf05d (Section 3.2.1.2), the\nauthors obtained an estimate for the average shear velocity of sand-moving winds at Arkhangelsky crater,\nnamely u\uf02a = 3.0 m/s. Excellent quantitative agreement was found between the morphological relations of\nthe barchans obtained in the simulation and those of the Arkhangelsky barchans (Figure 3.11a).\nThe calculations were then adapted to reproduce the shape of barchans at other locations on Mars\n(Parteli and Herrmann 2007b). In spite of the different minimal threshold velocity values predicted for\neach field owing to variations in atmospheric pressure, the values of u* estimated from the simulations in\nall cases were around 3.0 m/s (Parteli and Herrmann 2007b). This value is well within the maximum\nrange of values of u\uf02a on Mars (between 2.0 m/s and 4.0 m/s) as it has been estimated indirectly from\nobservations of surface erosion and ripple formation by the rovers (where estimations also assumed u*t \uf0bb\n2.0 m/s; Arvidson et al. 1983, Moore 1985, Sullivan et al. 2005). Observations from orbiters and landers\nsuggested that such extreme values of wind shear velocity occur occasionally on Mars, during global dust\nstorms (Arvidson et al. 1983, Moore 1985, Sullivan et al. 2005).\nAs mentioned above, there is strong theoretical evidence provided by recent works (Almeida et al.\n2006, Kok 2010a, 2010b, P\u00e4htz et al. 2012) for much lower values of impact threshold on Mars than the\none (2.0 m/s) previously estimated (Figure 2.18b). Future work should thus focus on reproducing the\nobserved morphology of martian dunes using these revised estimates of the martian impact thresholds.\n3.3.2.2 Exotic dune shapes of Mars\nExperiments in a water tank and computer simulations have shown that some exotic dune shapes\noccurring on Mars could form under directionally varying flows (Figure 3.11b-d). Taniguchi and Endo\n(2007) performed experiments of barchan ripples under reversing flow conditions, and found barchans\nwith deformed limbs that resembled dunes at Proctor crater (Figure 3.11d). Further, Parteli et al. (2009)\nextended the simulations of dune formation under bimodal winds (c.f. Fig. 3.7) to low sand availability\ncondition. The authors found that the resulting dune shape depends on \uf071w (which determines dune\nalignment, c.f. Section 3.1.5.1) as well as on the duration of the bimodal wind relative to the dune\nmigration time, i.e. tw = Tw/Tm: a value of tw smaller than 10-3 forms rounded barchans with reduced slip\nface (\"occluded barchans\"), if \uf071w \uf03d\uf020\uf034\uf030\uf0b0\uf02d\uf020\uf038\uf030\uf0b0; non-elongating \"wedge\" dunes (Figure 3.11b), if \uf071w\n\uf03d\uf020\uf031\uf030\uf030\uf0b0\uf020(also produced in water tank experiments by Hersen 2005), or elongating longitudinal bedforms\n(Figure 3.11c), if \uf071w \uf03e\uf020\uf031\uf031\uf030\uf0b0\uf020\uf028see Parteli et al. 2009 for a phase diagram of the morphology\uf029.\n3.3.2.3 Sand induration\nIncreased soil moisture is an important contributor to the immobilization of dunes. Crusting or induration\nof sand has been observed on Mars by Viking 1, Viking 2, Mars Pathfinder, Spirit, and Opportunity\nlanders (Arvidson et al., 2004, Moore et al., 1999, Thomas et al., 2005, Sullivan et al. 2008, 2011). The\nclassical experiments by Kerr and Nigra (1952) illustrated the dramatic consequences sand induration can\nhave for dune morphodynamics. The experiments consisted of spraying crude oil onto advancing\nbarchans, in order to halt their movement. The sand arriving at the fixed dunes from the upwind was\ndeposited at the lee, whereupon the dune was soaked with oil again. As this process continued, the slip\nface of the dunes became progressively smaller and each dune more elongated. The oil was sprayed on\nthe dunes in successive stages until all motion was stopped, and the dunes achieved a rounded, elliptical\ndome-shaped form.\nRounded barchans occur in the north polar region of Mars known as Chasma Boreale (Schatz et al.\n2006). Their discovery raised the question whether sand induration due to frozen carbon dioxide or the\npresence of salts as an intergranular cement (Clarck et al. 1982) could be a relevant agent for dune\nprocesses on Mars. Through using numerical modeling, Schatz et al. (2006) succeeded in reproducing the\ntransition from a crescent to a rounded dune shape (Kerr and Nigra 1952). Induration (non-mobility) was\nsimulated for each successive stage of dune development, while at the same time new sand was added\nfrom upwind (Figure 3.12). A further argument in favor of induration of the Chasma Boreale dunes is the\nsurprising co-existence of the rounded barchans with straight-crested linear dunes aligned parallel to the\n60\n\n\forientation of the barchans - the linear dunes should simply decay in barchans if the wind was\nunidirectional (Section 3.2.1.4). Possibly, sand saltating downwind along both sides of the indurated\nlinear dune could deposit at the lee due to secondary flow effects (not included in the model by Schatz et\nal. 2006) at the dune's downwind extremity (Tsoar, 2001), thus yielding dune elongation.\n\nFigure 3.12 Evidence for indurated sand dunes on Mars?

(2006) for the formation of the Chasma barchans: the dunes are indurated; sand incoming from the\nupwind is deposited at the lee, thus progressively reducing the size of the slip-face. The arrow indicates the wind\ndirection; (d) numerical simulations by Schatz et al. (2006) of sand transport over a indurated barchan (time\nincreases from left to right) produced a dome-like barchan (last snapshot on the right), thus supporting the\nconceptual model of the authors. After Schatz et al. (2006).\n\n3.3.3 Dunes on Venus\nOwing to the large atmospheric density of Venus, a minimal dune size of the order of 20cm is predicted\nfrom the scaling with \uf06cdrag (Claudin and Andreotti 2006). Indeed, wind tunnel experiments under constant\nwind and atmospheric pressure condition of Venus produced small transverse bedforms, named\nmicrodunes, with wavelengths within the range \uf031\uf030\uf02d\uf033\uf030 cm (Greeley et al. 1984, Marshall and Greeley,\n1992). These microdunes displayed several features reminiscent of Earth aeolian dunes, such as a slip\nface and a separation bubble. Tests using mixed sand sizes did not lead to crest-coarsened bedforms as\nexpected in the case of granule ripples (Sections 3.2.4.3), thus corroborating the conclusion that the\nmicrodunes were indeed small-scale prototypes of terrestrial \"full-scale transverse dunes\" (Marshall and\nGreeley 1992).\nDune fields identified in images of the Venus orbiter Magellan contain long-crested dunes much\nlarger than the microdunes of the wind tunnel (Greeley et al. 1992b, 1995, Weitz et al. 1994). The dunes\nhave length ranging from 500 m to 10 km, width of about 200 m, and values of interdune spacing of the\norder of 500 m (Greeley et al. 1992b) - these are dimensions akin to those of terrestrial dunes (Lancaster\n1995). The orientation of nearby surficial features indicates transverse dune alignment to the prevailing\nwind direction. Although microdunes are not visible as surface features in the Magellan images (images'\nresolution is 75 m; Weitz et al. 1994), their occasional occurrence has been indicated by Magellan's radar\ndata (Weitz et al. 1994). Because radar detection of the microdunes required their slip face be nearly\n61\n\n\fperpendicular to the radar illumination (Blom and Elachi 1987, Weitz et al. 1994), there might be many\nmore (small) dunes on Venus not detected by Magellan due to inadequate angle of the radar beam (Weitz\net al. 1994, Greeley et al. 1995). Alternatively, the relative scarceness of dunes or microdunes on Venus\nmight be a consequence of insufficient wind speeds, meager sand cover or a scarcity of sand-size particles\non Venus, where the effect of weathering caused by water is negligible compared to Mars or Earth (Weitz\net al. 1994).\n3.3.4 Dunes on Titan\nTitan dunes, first detected by radar images of the Cassini mission (Lorenz et al. 2006, Elachi et al. 2006),\nconcentrate along the equatorial belt between 30\u00b0S and 30\u00b0N. They appear as hundred of kilometers long\nstreams (i.e. linear dunes, c.f. Rubin and Hesp 2009) oriented nearly parallel to the equatorial axis.\nAlthough the minimal size predicted for dunes on Titan is about 1.5 m (Claudin and Andreotti 2006),\ndunes imaged by Cassini have heights of about 100 m, closely resembling longitudinal dunes in Namibia,\nboth in size and spacing (Lorenz et al. 2010). Their dark appearance is consistent with an organic\ncomposition of the constituent particles (Section 2.4). Recent debate on the formative processes of dunes\non Titan has advanced the knowledge on the atmosphere and wind systems of this moon of Saturn\n(Lunine and Lorenz 2009).\nDune crest orientation can provide valuable information on prevailing transport directions (Fenton et\nal. 2003). However, resolution of Cassini images of Titan dune fields (~ 350 m; LeGall et al. 2011) is too\nlow to resolve the profiles of dunes. The elongation direction of Titan dunes could be inferred indirectly\nfrom their behavior around topographic obstacles (Radebaugh et al. 2008, 2010). Radebaugh et al. (2010)\nexplain that the \"teardrop\" streamlined dune patterns in the image of Figure 3.13 can form if the dunes are\nelongating to the East - on Earth, linear dunes change orientation upwind of the obstacle, then resuming\ntheir original trend on the downwind side (Radebaugh et al. 2010).\n\nFigure 3.13 - Cassini Radar image centered on 6.5 S, 251W, acquired on Oct. 2005. North is to the top. The dunes\ndivert around the topographic obstacle (white area in the image) and resume on the downwind side, thus implying\nthat the direction of dune elongation is from SW-NE (L-R) in the image. After Radebaugh et al. (2010).\n\nThe global circulation model by Tokano (2010) shed light on the eastward elongation of Titan linear\ndunes. The model showed that exceptionally strong eastward wind gusts with velocities larger than\uf020\uf031\uf02e\uf030\nm/s, i.e. well above the average speed of westward winds (\uf0bb 0.6 m/s, see e.g. Lorenz 2010), occur twice a\nyear correlated with the convergence of northward and southward winds at the equator (constituting the\nso-called intertropical convergence zone, ITCZ). So, if a threshold velocity of\uf020\uf031\uf02e\uf030 m/s is assumed, then\n62\n\n\fsand transport and dune elongation can occur only during those strong eastward wind gusts. Interestingly,\nthis threshold wind velocity, which refers to a height of about 300 m above the surface (Tokano 2010),\ncorresponds to a threshold shear velocity of about 0.036 m/s, which is in close agreement with the\ntheoretical value predicted in chapter 2.4. Besides, seasonally reversing winds nearly perpendicular to the\ncrest of the dunes lead to a bimodal wind regime with divergence angle close to 180\u00b0 - which is\nformative of dunes of nearly \"reversing\" type (Section 3.2.1.4). Based on the simulations by Parteli et al.\n(2009), Tokano (2010) concluded that the lack of meandering of Titan dunes implies a large turnover time\nof the dunes relative to the time scale of this bimodal wind (Section 3.2.1.4).\nRubin and Hesp (2009) proposed a different scenario in which the sand of Titan dunes is indurated,\nsuch that dunes grow under unidirectional wind through a mechanism similar to the one suggested by\nSchatz et al. (2006) for the linear dunes at Chasma Boreale, Mars (Section 3.3.2.3). In this manner, dunes\noriented transversely or longitudinally to the equatorial axis would form in areas with loose or indurated\nsediments, respectively. Such an origin of Titan dunes remains to be tested by future modeling studies.\nWhatever the mechanism of formation and growth of linear dunes on Titan, their average spacing of 3\nkm is of the order of the height of Titan's atmospheric boundary layer, which has been estimated from in\nsitu data obtained by Huygens probe as well as indirectly from a global circulation model (Lorenz et al.\n2010). Titan dunes are giant dunes (Andreotti et al. 2009), in contrast to martian barchans that have sizes\nclose to the minimal size (Claudin and Andreotti 2006,Parteli et al. 2007a,b,Andreotti et al. 2009).\nPossibly, the crest of Titan dunes, unresolved in current images, is armored with smaller superimposed\ndunes indicating dune growth through amalgamation of bedforms (Lancaster 1988, Andreotti et al. 2009).\n\n63\n\n\f4. The physics of dust emission\nAs discussed in Section 1.2.1, mineral dust aerosols affect the Earth and Mars systems through a large\nvariety of interactions, including by scattering and absorbing radiation, and by serving as cloud nuclei\n(e.g., Leovy 2001, Jickells et al. 2005, Goudie and Middleton 2006). Understanding and simulating these\ninteractions and their effect on, for instance, weather and climate requires a comprehensive understanding\nof the physics of the emission of mineral dust aerosols, which we discuss in this chapter. Because the\nphysical conditions for dust lifting differ between Earth and Mars, we first discuss the physics of dust\nemission on Earth in Section 4.1, after which we discuss how the physics of dust emission differs on Mars\nin Section 4.2.\n4.1 The physics of dust emission on Earth\nSoils that are most sensitive to wind erosion and dust emission usually lack protection from vegetation,\nhave low soil moisture content (e.g., Marticorena and Bergametti 1995), and contain readily erodible\nsediments of fine particles (Prospero et al. 2002). As such, most substantial sources of dust aerosols are\ndeserts and dry lake beds, although dust emissions from vegetated landscapes and dune fields are also\ncommonly observed and are important especially to regional weather and climate (Bullard et al. 2005,\n2008, Okin 2008, Rivera Rivera et al. 2009, Okin et al. 2011).\nDust particles that can be transported thousands of kilometers from their source regions, and thereby\nproduce a substantial effect on weather and climate, predominantly have diameters smaller than 20 \uf06dm\n(Gillette and Walker 1977, Tegen and Lacis 1996). Particles in this size range are referred to as PM20 and\nexperience strong interparticle forces (Section 2.1.1.2), which causes them to rarely occur loosely in soils.\nRather, PM20 dust in soils occurs mostly as coatings on larger sand particles (Bullard et al. 2004) or as\npart of soil aggregates with a typical size of ~20 \u2013 300 \uf06dm (Alfaro et al. 1997, Shao 2001, 2008). Dust\naerosols are emitted naturally through three distinct processes (Shao 2001, 2008): (i) direct aerodynamic\nlifting, (ii) ejection of dust aerosols from soil aggregates by impacting saltating particles, and (iii) ejection\nof dust aerosols from soil aggregates that are participating in saltation (Figure 4.1). These latter two\nprocesses occur as a result of saltation bombardment, the impacts of saltating particles on the soil\n(Gillette et al. 1974, Shao et al. 1993a), which causes sandblasting, the release of dust aerosols from dust\naggregates that are either saltating or are impacted by saltators (Alfaro et al. 1997, Shao 2008). The\nemission of dust aerosols from either soil aggregates or saltating dust aggregates is thus initiated by wind\nspeeds exceeding the fluid threshold for saltation. In contrast, direct aerodynamic lifting of PM20 dust\nrequires wind speeds much larger than the saltation fluid threshold (Figure 2.2), except for a small\nfraction of PM20 soil particles that experience very weak interparticle forces (Klose and Shao 2012).\nConsequently, direct aerodynamic lifting is a substantially less important source of dust aerosols than\nimpact-induced emission from dust aggregates in the soil or in saltation (Gillette et al. 1974, Shao et al.\n1993a, Loosmore and Hunt 2000).\nIn addition to these three natural dust emission processes, dust can be emitted through human actions\nsuch as off-road vehicles. Such emissions could be important locally but are likely insignificant on a\nglobal scale (Gillies et al. 2005, Goossens et al. 2011). Dust emissions can also be enhanced by human\nsoil disturbances that lower the threshold shear velocity, such as grazing and other land use changes\n(Marticorena et al. 1997, Reynolds et al. 2001, Gillies et al. 2005, Neff et al. 2008). The resulting\nanthropogenic fraction of global dust emissions is highly uncertain, but possibly substantial (Tegen et al.\n2004, Mahowald et al. 2004).\nDust aerosols are thus predominantly emitted through the transfer of kinetic energy onto aggregates\nof dust, either by the impacts of saltators onto soil dust aggregates or by the impact of saltating dust\naggregates on the soil (Figure 4.1b, c). This transfer of kinetic energy onto an aggregate of bonded dust\nparticles creates elastic waves within the aggregate that can rupture the energetic bonds between\nindividual constituents of the aggregate (Kun and Herrmann 1999). This process creates dust aerosols\neither by damaging the aggregate, breaking it into two or more fragments with the size of the largest\nfragment comparable to the original size of the aggregate, or by fragmenting the aggregate, breaking it\ninto a large number of fragments for which the size of the largest fragment is small compared to the\n64\n\n\fFigure 4.1. Illustration of the three dust emission mechanisms: (a) aerodynamic entrainment, (b) ejection of dust\naerosols from soil aggregates by impacting saltating particles, and (c) ejection of dust aerosols from soil aggregates\nthat are participating in saltation. Adapted from figure 7.5 in Shao (2008).\n\noriginal size of the aggregate (Kun and Herrmann 1999). Kok (2011a) argued that dust emission through\nthe fragmentation of dust aggregates is analogous to the fragmentation of brittle materials such as glass,\nand used this analogy to derive an analytical expression for the size distribution of emitted dust aerosols\n(Section 4.1.3.3). The good agreement of the resulting theory with available field measurements (Figure\n4.3b) suggests that dust emission commonly occurs through fragmentation of dust aerosols, although\nmore research is required to further investigate this.\nSince the kinetic energy supplied by saltator impacts drives the emission of dust aerosols, some\ntheoretical models of dust emission have assumed that the vertical flux of dust emitted by an eroding soil\nis proportional to the total kinetic energy of saltator impacts (Shao et al. 1993a, 1996, Shao 2001, 2004),\nwhich is supported by wind tunnel measurements (Zobeck 1991a, Shao et al. 1993a, Rice et al. 1996).\nHowever, Lu and Shao (1999) took a slightly different approach by considering that an impacting saltator\n\"ploughs\" through the soil (Rice et al. 1996), thereby ejecting soil particles in its path. The volume of soil\ntraversed by the impacting saltator in this manner was then taken to be representative of the resulting\nvertical dust flux. Assuming the soil to be plastic, Lu and Shao (1999) predicted that dust emission due to\nsaltation bombardment scales with u*4 for soft, easily erodible soils, and with u*3 for harder, less erodible,\nsoils. Shao (2001, 2004) expanded this theory to include the contribution from the disintegration of\nsaltating dust aggregates and also proposed a theory for the size distribution of the vertical dust flux as a\nfunction of wind speed and the parent soil size distribution (Section 4.1.3.2).\nThe qualitative understanding of the physics of dust emission discussed above can be combined with\nthe detailed understanding of saltation reviewed in chapter 2 to develop quantitative expressions for (i)\nthe wind speed threshold above which dust emission occurs, (ii) the vertical dust flux emitted by the soil\n65\n\n\fwhen this threshold is exceeded, and (iii) the size distribution of emitted dust aerosols. We discuss these\nthree subjects in the following sections.\n4.1.1 The threshold for dust emission\nSince dust aerosol emission is primarily due to saltation bombardment and subsequent sandblasting, the\nthreshold wind speed above which dust emission occurs is the saltation fluid threshold. However, the\nfluid threshold discussed in Section 2.1.1 applies to ideal soils of loose, dry sand, which are not\nnecessarily characteristic of soils susceptible to wind erosion. These soils have several components that\ncan enhance their resistance to wind erosion, including crusts (Cahill et al. 1996, Belnap et al. 1998,\nGomes et al. 2003, Ravi et al. 2011), soil aggregates (Chepil 1950), soil moisture (Belly 1964), and nonerodible roughness elements such as pebbles, rocks, or vegetation (Lancaster and Baas 1998). In the\nfollowing sections, we discuss the corrections to the saltation fluid threshold that are required to account\nfor the presence of soil moisture and non-erodible roughness elements.\n4.1.1.1 Effect of soil moisture on the saltation fluid threshold\nThe presence of soil moisture can create substantial interparticle forces that inhibit the initiation of\nsaltation, especially for sandy soils (Chepil 1956, Belly 1964, McKenna Neuman and Nickling 1989,\nSherman et al. 1998). For low relative humidities (below ~65 %), these interparticle forces are produced\nprimatirly by bonding of adjacent adsorbed water layers (hygroscopic forces), whereas for high relative\nhumidities (above ~65 %) this occurs primarily through the formation of water wedges around points of\ncontact (capillary forces) (Hillel 1980, Ravi et al. 2006, Nickling and McKenna Neuman 2009).\nWater adsorption is governed by electrostatic interactions of the mineral surface with the polar water\nmolecules. Since sandy soils generally contain a lower density of net electric charges, substantially less\nwater can be adsorbed onto sandy soils than onto clayey soils (Hillel 1980). Consequently, water bridges\nform in sandy soils at a relatively low soil moisture content, thereby producing substantial capillary forces\n(e.g., Belly 1964). McKenna Neuman and Nickling (1989) used this observation to derive an expression\nfor the increase of the saltation fluid threshold for sand due to the presence of soil moisture. F\u00e9can et al.\n(1999) then generalized the McKenna Neuman and Nickling expression to all soil types, obtaining the\nfollowing empirical expressions\n\nu*wt\n\uf03d 1,\n(w < w')\nu*ft\n(4.1)\nu*wt\n0.68\n\uf03d 1 \uf02b 1.21\uf028w \uf02d w'\uf029\n(w \u2265 w')\nu*ft\nwhere u*wt and u*ft are respectively the fluid saltation thresholds in the presence and absence of soil\nmoisture, and w is the soil's volumetric water content in percent. Since water adsorbs more readily onto\nclay soils (Hillel 1980), the volumetric fraction of water that the soil can absorb before capillary forces\nbecome substantial, w', increases with the soil's clay content. Using curve fitting of Eq. (4.1) to\nexperimental results, F\u00e9can et al. (1999) obtained\n(4.2)\nw' \uf03d 0.17cs \uf02b 0.0014cs2 ,\nwhere cs is the soil's clay content in percent.\nAlthough the empirical parameterization of Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2) ignores interparticle forces due to\nbonding of adsorbed water layers, which is likely substantial for soils with either a high clay content or a\nlow soil moisture content (Hillel 1980, Ravi et al. 2004, 2006), this fairly straightforward\nparameterization seems to reasonably match measurements and is widely used to parameterize the effect\nof soil moisture on the dust emission threshold in atmospheric circulation models (e.g., Zender et al.\n2003a).\n\n66\n\n\f4.1.1.2 Effect of non-erodible roughness elements on the saltation fluid threshold\nIn addition to soil moisture, the saltation fluid threshold is also affected by the presence of non-erodible\nroughness elements such as pebbles, rocks, and vegetation. Since the flow resistance of these objects is\nsubstantially larger than that of bare soil, they extract momentum from the wind. The presence of\nroughness elements therefore reduces the wind shear stress on the intervening bare soil and increases the\ntotal threshold wind stress required to initiate saltation and dust emission (Raupach et al. 1993).\nThe effect of roughness elements on the saltation fluid threshold depends on the partitioning of the\ntotal wind stress between the fraction absorbed by the bare soil (\u03c4S) and the fraction absorbed by the\nroughness elements (\u03c4R) (Schlichting 1936),\n(4.3)\n\uf074 \uf03d \uf074 S \uf02b\uf074 R .\nThe difficulty now lies in relating the partitioning of the fluid drag to the properties of the roughness\nelements. The absorption of fluid drag by roughness elements is largely determined by the frontal area\npresented to the flow (Marshall 1971), which is captured in the roughness density \u03bb (e.g., Raupach 1992),\n(4.4)\n\uf06c \uf03d nbh ,\nwhere n is the number of roughness elements per unit area, and b and h are the average width and height\nof the roughness elements. By first relating the fluid drag absorbed by roughness elements to the\nroughness density \u03bb and then assuming that the area and volume of the wakes of different roughness\nelements are randomly superimposed, Raupach (1992) derived an approximate expression for the fraction\nof the fluid drag absorbed by the bare soil,\n(4.5)\n\uf074S\n1\n.\n\uf03d\n\n\uf074\n\n1 \uf02b \uf062\uf06c\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the ratio of the drag coefficients of a typical roughness element and the bare soil, which is on\nthe order of ~100 for typical conditions. Raupach et al. (1993) then expanded the Raupach (1992) drag\npartitioning theory to estimate the effect of roughness elements on the saltation fluid threshold and\nobtained an expression for the ratio R of the fluid threshold without and with roughness elements (Gillette\nand Stockton 1989):\n1/ 2\n(4.6)\nu*ft, bare\n\uf0e9\n\uf0f9\n1\n,\nR\uf03d\n\uf03d\nu*ft, rough \uf0ea\uf0eb \uf0281 \uf02d m\uf073\uf06c \uf029\uf0281 \uf02b m\uf062\uf06c \uf029\uf0fa\uf0fb\nwhere \u03c3 is the ratio of the basal area to the frontal area for the roughness elements, and m (0 < m \u2264 1) is a\nfactor meant to account for the fact that the fluid saltation threshold of a homogeneous soil is not\ndetermined by the average shear stress required for particle mobilization, but rather by the maximum\nshear acting on any erodible point on the surface. Raupach et al. (1993) recommended m \u2248 0.5 for flat,\nerodible surfaces based on comparisons with the experimental data of Gillette and Stockton (1989).\nSubsequent wind tunnel and field measurements of the drag partition and the ratio R have generally\nconfirmed the validity of Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6), although most experiments had to adapt the values of \u03c3, m,\nand \u03b2 from the values proposed by Raupach (Wyatt and Nickling 1997, Crawley and Nickling 2003, King\net al. 2005, Gillies et al. 2007).\nDespite the reasonable agreement of Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6) with measurements, the roughness density \u03bb\ndoes not fully capture the dependence of the drag partition on the physical properties, dimensions, spatial\ndistribution, and orientation of the roughness elements (Gillies et al. 2006, Nickling and McKenna\nNeuman 2009). For instance, the drag partition is affected by the porosity (Shao 2008) and Reynolds\nnumber dependency of the roughness element drag coefficients (Gillies et al. 2002), which is highly\nrelevant for determining the effects of vegetation on the saltation fluid threshold (Okin 2005, 2008).\nMoreover, the spatial distribution of the roughness elements can play an important role in determining\ntheir effect on the fluid threshold. For example, Okin and Gillette (2001) found that the distribution of\nvegetation in a semi-arid mesquite landscape adapts in such a manner as to form \"streets\" of readily\nerodible bare soil, for which the saltation fluid threshold is substantially lower than would be predicted\nwith Eq. (4.6). The non-uniformity of the spatial distribution of vegetation thus likely results in higher\n\n67\n\n\fsaltation and dust emission fluxes than would be predicted using the Raupach model (Okin 2005, 2008),\nwhich assumes a random distribution (Raupach 1992).\n4.1.2 The vertical dust flux\nWhen the saltation fluid threshold discussed in the previous sections is exceeded, saltation bombardment\nof the soil is initiated. As discussed above, dust aerosols are mainly emitted through the transfer of kinetic\nenergy to dust aggregates through saltator impacts. The vertical flux of dust aerosols Fd emitted by an\neroding soil thus depends on (i) the flux ns of saltators impacting onto the soil, (ii) the average kinetic\nenergy E s delivered by these saltators, and (iii) the efficiency \u03b5 with which this kinetic energy is\nconverted to emitted dust aerosols. That is, the vertical dust flux can be expressed as\n(4.7)\nFd \uf03d ns Es\uf065 ,\nwhere the dust emission efficiency \u03b5 has units of kg/J and is defined as the average mass of dust aerosols\nproduced by a unit of impacting energy. The number of saltation impacts on the soil surface per unit time\nand area ns can be derived from the balance of horizontal momentum in the saltation layer (Eqs. 2.20 and\n2.21), which yields (Shao et al. 1993a)\n\nns \uf03d\n\n\uf072 a \uf028u*2 \uf02d u*2sfc \uf029\n\n\uf028\n\nms vimp,x \uf02d vlo,x\n\n\uf029\n\n,\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere ms is the typical mass of saltators, u*sfc is the shear velocity at the surface as defined by Eq. (2.28),\nand v imp,x and v lo,x are respectively the mean horizontal components of the speeds with which saltators\nimpact and lift off from the surface. Using that the lift-off speed of saltating particles is ~vimp/2 and that\nthe impact and rebounding angles are ~12o and ~35o (see Section 2.1.3), Eq. (4.8) reduces to\n\nns \uf040\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\n2 \uf072 a u*2 \uf02d u*2sfc\n,\nms vimp\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere v imp is the mean saltator impact speed. The final term in Eq. (4.7) is the mean impact energy of\nsaltating particles Es . Since the saltating particle impact speed vimp approximately follows an exponential\ndistribution (Kok 2010a, Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011a),\n2\n\nEs \uf0bb ms vimp ,\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere vimp is the mean impact speed of saltating particles. Substituting Eqs. (4.8) \u2013 (4.10) into Eq. (4.7)\nand approximating u*sfc with u*it (Shao et al. 1993a) (see Section 2.3.2.3 for a discussion of this\napproximation) then yields\n2\n(4.11)\nF \uf03d 2\uf072 u \uf02d u 2 \uf065 v .\nd\n\na\n\n\uf028\n\n*\n\n*it\n\n\uf029\n\nimp\n\nAs was the case for parameterizations of the saltation mass flux (Section 2.3.2.3), different\nassumptions for the dependence of \uf065 and vimp on u* result in different relationships for the vertical dust\nflux Fd as a function of u* . Shao et al. (1993) inferred from their wind tunnel measurements that the dust\nemission efficiency \u03b5 is constant with u* (at least for the loose dry soil used in their experiment), which\nwas later confirmed by Rice et al. (1996). Shao et al. further assumed that vimp is proportional to u* ,\nresulting in\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\nFd \uf03d CS \uf072 a u* u* \uf02d u*2it .\n2\n\n(4.12)\n\n68\n\n\fHowever, we now know from wind tunnel and field measurements that vimp is independent of u* for\ntransport limited saltation (see Figure 2.12) and thus that the assumption that vimp is proportional to u* is\nincorrect. A more physical approximation of Eq. (4.11) is thus\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf029\n\nFd \uf03d CF \uf072 a u*it u* \uf02d u*2it ,\n2\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere the proportionality constants CS and CF have units of kg / J, and where we used that vimp \uf0b5 u*it\n(see Section 2.3.2.3).\n\nFigure 4.2. Compilation of field measurements of the vertical dust flux emitted by eroding soils. The large\ndifferences between the data sets are mostly due to variations in soil erodibility and saltation fluid threshold.\nIncluded for illustration are several vertical dust flux relations (lines), which use u*it = 0.20 m/s and are normalized\nto yield 10 mg/m2/sec at u* = 1 m/s.\n\nAn alternative approach to deriving an expression for Fd is to assume that the vertical dust flux is\nproportional to the horizontal saltation flux (Marticorena and Bergametti 1995). This appears to be a\nreasonable assumption since the saltation flux and the amount of kinetic energy impacting on the soil\nsurface have a similar scaling with u* (see Table 2.1 and Eq. (4.11)). This assumption results in (Gillette\n1979, Marticorena and Bergametti, 1995)\n(4.14)\nFd \uf03d \uf061Q ,\nwhere \uf061 is the sandblasting efficiency, which is on the order of 10-5 \u2013 10-2 m-1 (Gillette 1979, Marticorena\nand Bergametti 1995, Gomes et al. 2003, Rajot et al. 2003). The equation for Q used with Eq. (4.14) is\nmost commonly that of Kawamura (1951) (see Table 2.1 and Marticorena and Bergametti 1995, Zender et\nal. 2003a), resulting in\n\nFd \uf03d CK\n\n\uf0e6 u*2it \uf0f6\uf0e6 u*it\nu* \uf0e7\uf0e71 \uf02d 2 \uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0e71 \uf02b\n\uf0e7\ng\nu*\n\uf0e8 u* \uf0f8\uf0e8\n\n\uf072a\n\n3\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7,\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\n(4.15)\n\n69\n\n\fwhere the proportionality constant CK has units of m-1. Note that although a range of studies have indeed\nfound that the vertical dust flux scales with the saltation mass flux (Gillette 1979, Shao et al. 1993a,\nGomes et al. 2003), results from other investigators indicate that the vertical dust flux increases more\nrapidly with wind speed than the horizontal saltation flux (e.g., Nickling et al. 1999). A possible cause of\nthese divergent results is that the dust emission efficiency \u03b5 increases with u* for certain soils. Further\nresearch is required to resolve this issue.\nIn addition to Eqs. (4.12), (4.13), and\n(4.15), an expression for Fd based on an unpublished analysis by P.R. Owen was provided by Gillette\nand Passi (1988),\n4\n(4.16)\nF \uf03d C u \uf0281 \uf02d u / u \uf029 ,\nd\n\nGP *\n\n*it\n\n*\n\nwhere the proportionality constant CGP has units of kg m-6 s3.\nThe different vertical dust flux equations are plotted in Figure 4.2, which also includes a compilation\nof field measurements. The large spread in the vertical dust flux measured in different field studies is\nindicative of both the experimental difficulties in measuring the vertical dust flux (Zobeck et al. 2006),\nand the large sensitivity of dust emission to differences in saltation fluid threshold and soil properties\n(Marticorena and Bergametti 1995, Shao 2008). We discuss the dependence of dust emissions on soil\nproperties in the next section.\n4.1.2.1 Dependence of the vertical dust flux on soil properties\nAlthough the proportionality constants CS, CF, CK, and CGP in Eqs. (4.12) \u2013 (4.16) are independent of u* ,\nthese parameters depend on how efficiently impacting kinetic energy is converted into emitted dust\naerosols. Specifically, soil properties such as the clay content (Marticorena and Bergametti 1995), the\nbonding strength of soil dust aggregates (Shao et al. 1993a, Rice et al. 1996), the dry aggregate size\ndistribution (Chepil 1950, Zobeck 1991b), the presence of soil crusts (Belnap et al. 1998, Gomes et al.\n2003), and the soil plastic pressure (Lu and Shao 1999) are thought to determine these proportionality\nconstants. Unfortunately, the exact dependence of the vertical dust flux on these physical parameters is\nboth poorly understood and requires detailed knowledge of soil properties that are not normally available\non regional or global scales (e.g., Shao 2001, Laurent et al. 2008). Extensive further study is thus required\nto better relate the vertical dust flux to soil properties.\nIn order to parameterize observed regions of high dust emission potential despite these problems,\natmospheric circulation models generally use empirical parameterizations (e.g., Marticorena and\nBergametti 1995, Ginoux et al. 2001, Tegen et al. 2002, Zender et al. 2003a). In particular, the soil's\nability to produce dust aerosols is often captured in an empirical soil erodibility function. Prospero et al.\n(2002) noted from multi-decadal observations by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS)\nonboard the Nimbus 7 satellite that areas with high dust loading coincided with topographic lows, which\nthey hypothesized to be due to the fluvial deposition of fine-grained material in topographic lows. This\nfinding was subsequently used to propose empirical soil erodibility parameterizations (Ginoux et al. 2001,\nTegen et al. 2002, Zender et al. 2003b); for instance, Ginoux et al. (2001) proposed an empirical\nformulation of the soil erodibility based on the relative height of a model grid box compared to its\nsurroundings. However, advection of dust plumes after emission causes the high dust loading observed by\nTOMS to be shifted downwind from dust source regions (Schepanski et al. 2007), which later studies\nindicate are actually concentrated in mountain foothill regions and dry lake beds (Schepanski et al. 2009).\nAlthough the use of soil erodibility parameterizations improves model agreement with measurements\n(Zender et al. 2003b, Cakmur et al. 2006), the empirical nature of these parameterizations suggests that\nimprovements in understanding the dependence of the vertical dust flux on soil properties could bring\ncorresponding improvements in simulations of the dust cycle. Indeed, current model simulations of the\nglobal dust cycle still show substantial discrepancies with measurements (e.g., Cakmur et al. 2006).\n\n70\n\n\f4.1.3 The size distribution of emitted dust aerosols\nAccurately assessing the effects of mineral dust aerosols on the Earth and Mars systems requires not only\na detailed understanding of what processes determine the vertical dust flux, but also an understanding of\nthe size distribution of the emitted dust. Indeed, the size distribution of mineral dust governs the\ninteractions with radiation, clouds, ecosystems, the cryosphere, and public health (Tegen et al. 1996,\nGoudie and Middleton 2006, Mahowald et al. 2011, Ito et al. 2012).\nAs discussed in Section 4.1, the dominant source of dust aerosols is their ejection from dust\naggregates through the rupture of interparticle bonds by elastic waves created by mechanical saltator\nimpacts. The exact pattern in which these interparticle bonds are ruptured then determines the size\ndistribution of emitted dust aerosols. Unfortunately, the interparticle forces bonding dust particles to each\nother and to other soil components are due to a large variety of complex and poorly understood\ninteractions (see Section 2.1.1.2) (Zimon 1982, Shao 2001, Castellanos 2005). Nonetheless, several\ntheories for dust emission have been proposed that relate the size distribution of emitted dust aerosols to\nthe wind speed and the soil size distribution.\n4.1.3.1 The Dust Production Model (DPM)\nThe Dust Production Model (DPM) assumes that sandblasting results in the emission of three separate\nlognormal modes of dust aerosols, with the relative contribution of each mode determined by its bonding\nenergy and the kinetic energy of impacting saltators (Alfaro et al. 1997, Alfaro and Gomes 2001). Using\nwind tunnel experiments with two separate soils, Alfaro et al. (1998) determined the median diameters of\nthe three modes to be 1.5, 6.7, and 14.2 \uf06dm. However, recent field measurements suggest that the bonding\nenergies and median diameter of these three lognormal modes might need to be adapted for specific soils\n(Sow et al. 2011).\nSince the rupturing of interparticle bonds requires energy, the DPM predicts that larger saltating\nparticle impact energies produce more disaggregated and thus smaller dust aerosols, as also suggested by\nexperiments showing that glass broken at larger input energies produces a larger fraction of small\nfragments (Scheibel et al. 1990, Weichert 1991). Because the DPM further assumes that the saltator\nimpact speed is proportional to wind speed, it predicts a shift to smaller aerosol sizes with increasing\nwind speed. Although the assumption that saltator impact speeds scale with u* conflicts with\nmeasurements for transport limited saltation (Figure 2.12), several wind tunnel studies indeed observed a\nshift to smaller aerosol sizes with increasing wind speed (Alfaro et al. 1997, 1998, Alfaro 2008).\nConsequently, the theory of Alfaro and Gomes (2001) is in agreement with these wind tunnel\nmeasurements (Figure 4.3a).\nThe possible dependence of the dust size distribution on the wind speed is discussed in more detail in\nSection 4.1.3.4.\n4.1.3.2 The Shao theory\nA second theory for the size distribution of emitted dust aerosols was formulated by Shao (2001, 2004)\nand is based on the insight that the emitted dust size distribution must be bound by the two extreme states\nof the soil: the undisturbed, minimally disaggregated state, and the disturbed, fully disaggregated state.\nThat is,\n(4.17)\npd \uf028Dp \uf029 \uf03d \uf067pm \uf028Dp \uf029 \uf02b \uf0281 \uf02d \uf067 \uf029 pf \uf028Dp \uf029,\nwhere pd, pm, and pf are respectively the particle size distributions of the emitted dust aerosols, the\nminimally disturbed soil, and the fully disaggregated soil. Using the assumption that the saltator impact\nspeed scales with u* , Shao postulated a weighting factor \u03b3 that increases monotonically with the energy\nof impacting saltators:\n(4.18)\n\uf067 \uf03d exp \uf02d k \uf028u* \uf02d u*t \uf029n ,\nwhere k and n are empirical coefficients that are determined from fitting of Eq. (4.17) and (4.18) to\nexperimental data. An important similarity of the Shao model to the DPM is that it also predicts that an\n\n\uf05b\n\n\uf05d\n\n71\n\n\fincrease in u* results in more disaggregated, and hence smaller, dust aerosols. Like the DPM, the Shao\n(2001, 2004) model is in agreement with the Alfaro wind tunnel measurements (Figure 4.3a), although it\nrequires the n and k parameters to be tuned accordingly. However, Shao et al. (2011b) recently found that\na constant value of \u03b3 (i.e., independent of u* ) produced the best agreement with field measurements.\n4.1.3.3 Brittle fragmentation theory\nThe theories of Alfaro and Gomes (2001) and Shao (2001, 2004) provide a framework for predicting the\ndust size distribution of emitted dust aerosols. However, the use of these theories for regional and global\ncirculation model parameterizations of dust emission is limited by the poor understanding of the\ninterparticle forces that determine both the energy required to rupture the cohesive bonds between soil\nparticles (in the case of the DPM; see Sow et al. 2011) and the soil's aggregation state (in the case of\nShao's theory). Moreover, the DPM and especially Shao's theory require knowledge of the soil size\ndistribution, which is not normally available on regional and global scales.\nAs a way to circumvent the problem of the poorly understood interparticle forces and bonding\nenergies and the resulting use of empirical coefficients, Kok (2011a) developed an alternative theory for\nthe size distribution of emitted dust aerosols, assuming that most dust emission is due to brittle material\nfragmentation. This idea was previously noted by Gill et al. (2006) based on the observation from soil\nscience that stressed dry soil aggregates fail as brittle materials (Lee and Ingles 1968, Braunack et al.\n1979, Perfect and Kay 1995, Zobeck et al. 1999). Since the size distribution of fragments resulting from\nbrittle material fragmentation is determined by the patterns in which cracks nucleate, propagate, and\nmerge in the material (Astrom 2006), the analogy of dust emission with brittle material fragmentation\nmostly eliminates the need for a detailed understanding of interparticle forces to predict the emitted dust\nsize distribution. Moreover, since the pattern with which cracks propagate and merge is largely scaleinvariant (Astrom 2006), the size distribution of fragments produced by brittle material fragmentation\nfollows a simple power law, with the exponent of the power law only weakly dependent on the brittle\nobject's shape (Oddershede et al. 1993) and seemingly invariant to the material type (see Figure 1 in Kok\n2011a). (Note that scale invariance occurs for many natural phenomena, including avalanches, the\nfragmentation of rocks and atomic nuclei, and earthquakes (Gutenberg and Richter 1954, Turcotte 1986,\nBak et al. 1987, Bondorf et al. 1995, Astrom et al. 2004).)\nEvidence that the fragmentation of dust aggregates is indeed a form of brittle material fragmentation\nis that the power law that describes the size distribution of fragments produced by brittle fragmentation\nalso describes the size distribution of emitted dust aerosols in a limited size range (~2 \u2013 10 \uf06dm; see figure\n2 in Kok, 2011a). The emission of aerosols > 10 \uf06dm is depleted relative to this power law because of the\nfinite propagation distance \u03bb of the side branches of cracks created in the dust aggregate by a fragmenting\nimpact (Astrom 2006). Conversely, the emission of aerosols < 2 \uf06dm is depleted relative to the power law\nbecause the discrete particles composing the dust aggregates have a typical size of ~1 \uf06dm, which inhibits\nthe creation of smaller fragments. Since many dust aerosols are aggregates themselves (Okada et al. 2001,\nE. A. Reid et al. 2003, Chou et al. 2008), Kok assumed that the production of dust aerosols with size Dd is\nproportional to the volume fraction of soil particles with size Ds \u2264 Dd that can contribute to the formation\nof the aerosol. By combining this assumption with the size distribution resulting from brittle material\nfragmentation (reviewed in Astrom 2006), Kok (2011a) derived relatively straightforward analytical\nexpressions for the number and volume size distribution of emitted dust aerosols:\n\uf0e9 \uf0e6 Dd \uf0f6 3 \uf0f9\n\uf0e6 ln Dd / Ds \uf0f6\uf0f9\ndN d\n1 \uf0e9\n(4.19)\n\uf0f7\uf0fa exp \uf0ea\uf02d \uf0e7\n\uf03d\n\uf0f7 \uf0fa , and\n\uf0ea1 \uf02b erf \uf0e7\uf0e7\n\uf0f7\nd ln Dd c N Dd2 \uf0eb\uf0ea\n\uf0e8 2 ln \uf073 s \uf0f8\uf0fb\uf0fa\n\uf0eb\uf0ea \uf0e8 \uf06c \uf0f8 \uf0fb\uf0fa\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf028\n\n\uf0e6 ln Dd / Ds\ndVd\nD \uf0e9\n\uf03d d \uf0ea1 \uf02b erf \uf0e7\n\uf0e7 2 ln \uf073\nd ln Dd c V \uf0ea\uf0eb\ns\n\uf0e8\n\n\uf029\n\n\uf029\uf0f6\uf0f7\uf0f9\uf0fa exp \uf0e9\uf0ea\uf02d \uf0e6\uf0e7 D\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\uf0fb\uf0fa\n\n3\n\uf0f6 \uf0f9\n\uf0f7 \uf0fa,\n\uf06c\n\uf0e8\n\uf0f8 \uf0fb\uf0fa\n\uf0eb\uf0ea\n\n72\n\nd\n\n(4.20)\n\n\fwhere Nd and Vd are respectively the normalized number and volume of dust aerosols with size Dd, cN =\n0.9539 \u03bcm-2 and cV = 12.62 \u03bcm are normalization constants, Ds \u2248 3.4 \uf06dm and \uf073s \u2248 3.0 are the median\ndiameter by volume and the geometric standard deviation of the log-normal distribution that describes a\n\"typical\" arid soil size distribution in the PM20 size range, erf is the error function, and \u03bb \u2248 12 \uf06dm\ndenotes the propagation distance of the side branches of cracks created in the dust aggregate by a\nfragmenting impact.\nThe brittle fragmentation theory applies only to dust emission events that are predominantly due to\nthe fragmentation of soil aggregates. Therefore, Eqs. (4.19) and (4.20) are for instance not valid for (i)\naerodynamically lifted dust, (ii) dust emitted mainly by impacts in the damage regime (Kun and\nHerrmann 1999), which could occur either for very cohesive soils or for sandy soils where most of the\nPM20 dust exists as coatings on larger sand grains (Bullard et al. 2004), and (iii) dust with diameters\nlarger than \u223c20 \u03bcm, which are more likely to occur as loose particles in the soil (Alfaro et al. 1997, Shao\n2001), such that their emission is not predominantly due to fragmenting impacts. Despite these\nlimitations, the good agreement of Eqs. (4.19) and (4.20) with 7 different data sets of field measurements\n(Figure 4.3b) suggests that many natural dust emission events are due to aggregate fragmentation and can\nthus be reasonably described by brittle fragmentation theory. Further research is required to investigate\nthis issue.\n\nFigure 4.3. (a) Wind tunnel measurements of the size distribution of dust aerosols produced by saltation\nbombardment of a clay substrate (symbols; Alfaro et al. 1997). Both the DPM (green line) and the theoretical model\nof Shao (magenta line) can reproduce these measurements after tuning of the model parameters. (b) Compilation of\nfield measurements of the size distribution of emitted dust aerosols (assorted symbols). The brittle fragmentation\ntheory of dust emission (solid line) is in good agreement with these measurements, including the data set of Shao et\nal. (2011b), which was published subsequent to the brittle fragmentation theory (Kok 2011a). Note that the emitted\ndust size distribution predicted by the theories of Alfaro and Gomes (2001) and Shao (2001, 2004) cannot be\nincluded on this plot because they depend on both the soil size distribution and the wind speed. The processing of\nthe field measurements is described in Kok (2011a).\n\n4.1.3.4 Dependence of emitted dust size distribution on wind and soil conditions\nMeasurements and theories have yielded conflicting results on whether the dust size distribution depends\non the wind speed at emission. Whereas the Alfaro and Gomes (2001) and Shao (2001, 2004) theories\npredict a decrease in the mean dust aerosol size with u* , the brittle fragmentation theory of dust emission\n(Eqs. (4.19) and (4.20)) predicts that the size distribution is independent of u* . Similarly, the wind tunnel\nmeasurements of Alfaro and colleagues (Alfaro et al. 1997, 1998, Alfaro 2008) reported a strong\ndependence of the emitted dust size distribution on u* , whereas some field measurements have not found\nsuch a dependence (Gillette et al. 1974, Shao et al. 2011b). The study of Kok (2011b) attempted to settle\n73\n\n\fthis issue using a statistical analysis of the mean aerosol diameter of published field measurements\n(Gillette 1974, Gillette et al. 1974, Sow et al. 2009, Shao et al. 2011b). This study showed that individual\ndata sets had opposing and statistically insignificant trends with u* . Moreover, a compilation of all\npublished field measurements showed no statistically significant trend with u* , indicating that the size\ndistribution of emitted dust aerosols does not depend on the wind speed at emission. A similar conclusion\nwas reached by Reid et al. (2008), based on the similarity of measured size distributions of dust advected\nwith different wind speeds at emission.\nKok (2011b) also offered a possible explanation for the discrepancy between field measurements on\nthe one hand and wind tunnel measurements and the theories of Alfaro and Gomes (2001) and Shao\n(2001, 2004) derived from them on the other hand. The measurements of Alfaro et al. (1997, 1998) were\nprobably not in steady state since the wind tunnel was only 3.1 meters in length (Alfaro et al. 1997, p.\n11243). Consequently, the saltator impact speed could have increased with u* , which in turn could have\nproduced a shift to smaller aerosols as proposed by Alfaro and colleagues. Similarly, the dependence of\nthe emitted dust size distribution on u* in the DPM and Shao theories is due to the assumption in these\nmodels that the saltator impact speed scales with u* , which measurements indicate is incorrect for\ntransport limited steady state saltation (Figure 2.12).\nAll three theories reviewed above also include a dependence on the soil size distribution, and many\nregional and global circulation models also account for a soil dependence of the emitted dust size\ndistribution (e.g., Ginoux et al. 2001, Laurent et al. 2008). However, the small amount of scatter between\nthe dust flux measurements compiled in Figure 4.3b, despite the widely varying soil types for which these\nmeasurements were made, suggests that changes in soil conditions have only a limited effect on the\nemitted dust size distribution. A similar conclusion is suggested by the insensitivity of dust aerosol size\ndistributions to changes in the source region (Reid et al. 2008). More research is clearly needed to better\nquantify the influence of the soil size distribution on the emitted dust size distribution, but the apparently\nlimited dependence of the emitted dust size distribution to the soil size distribution is highly fortuitous for\nregional and global dust modeling of the dust cycle.\n4.1.4 Deposition of dust aerosols\nAfter emission, mineral dust aerosols are removed from the atmosphere by either dry deposition or wet\ndeposition. Dry deposition is due to the combined action of gravitational settling with turbulent diffusion\nin the atmospheric boundary layer and molecular diffusion in the laminar sublayer near surfaces, such as\nvegetation canopies (Slinn 1982). Wet deposition includes both in-cloud scavenging, in which dust\naerosols serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei and subsequently precipitate (DeMott et al. 2003,\n2010), and below-cloud scavenging (Jung and Shao 2006), in which precipitating raindrops collect dust\naerosols. Wet deposition generally dominates for aerosols smaller than ~5 \uf06dm in diameter, whereas dry\ndeposition dominates for aerosols larger than ~5 \uf06dm (Woodward 2001, Zender et al. 2003a, Miller et al.\n2006). The resulting lifetime of a dust aerosol decreases with its size and ranges from ~1-2 weeks for clay\naerosols (with diameter < 2 \uf06dm), to several hours or days for silt aerosols (>2 \uf06dm) (Tegen and Lacis\n1996, Zender et al. 2003a, Miller et al. 2006). Consequently, only aerosols smaller than ~20 \uf06dm in\ndiameter remain suspended in the Earth's atmosphere for sufficient time periods to substantially affect\nweather and climate (e.g., Tegen and Lacis 1996).\n4.2 Dust emission physics on Mars\nOrbital and landed spacecraft observations have made it obvious that airborne and surficial dust is an\nimportant and ubiquitous aspect of the present martian environment (e.g., Landis et al. 2000, Tomasko et\nal. 1999). Aeolian dust emission processes on Mars are in many ways similar to those in the most arid\nlocales on Earth. However, such processes on Mars are not modulated in a significant way by either\nliquids or vegetation, and the emitted dust has a unique martian character (e.g., Morris et al. 2000).\n\n74\n\n\fFigure 4.4. Mars Exploration Rover Spirit image (~31x31 mm) from its Microscopic Imager instrument, illustrating\nsurface agglomerates composed of air-fall dust that likely formed via the interaction of wind and electrostatic forces\n(e.g., Sullivan et al. 2008). The oriented texture in this image is likely due to the dust agglomerates gradually\ngrowing in size as they are gently rolled through the surrounding air-fall dust by the wind. This spatial texture is\nfiner on and near the rocks in this image, perhaps since the increased exposure to the wind in such locations reduces\nthe time that such a growth process can act before the dust agglomerates are entrained into the flow. Acquired on Sol\n70 within Gusev Crater, Mars. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell/USGS.\n\n4.2.1 Mars surface dust emission\nPlausible surface dust emission processes on contemporary Mars are numerous, and it is probable that all\nmay occur at some location and time on the planet (either singly or in concert). Mars' often ultra-arid\nsurface environment and known populations of micrometer-scale particles (e.g., Wolff et al. 2006)\nsuggests that electrostatic, magnetic, and even van der Waals forces may play important roles in\nmodulating dust emission from Mars' surface. Similar to Earth (Section 4.1), atmospheric dust\nentrainment induced by sand-sized particle saltation is likely a major emission process on Mars (e.g.,\nGreeley 2002). Relevant in situ observations have been obtained by the twin NASA Mars Exploration\nRovers (MERs), specifically by their optical Microscopic Imager (MI) instruments, definitively\nidentifying solid sand-sized particles that could participate in such a dust entrainment process (e.g.,\nSoderblom et al. 2004). Such particles have been generally inferred to exist on much of Mars' surface\n(e.g., due to the presence of dunes, see Section 3.3). The recent result that the impact threshold for\nsaltation is approximately an order of magnitude below the fluid threshold (Section 2.4 and Figure 2.18b)\nwould allow saltation-induced dust emission to occur for substantially lower wind speeds than previously\nthought (Almeida et al. 2008, Kok 2010b).\nIn addition to traditional saltation-induced dust emission, the MER MI instruments discovered that\nthe dust itself often formed low-strength sand-sized spheroidal agglomerates (see Figure 4.4, possibly due\nto electrostatic processes (e.g., Sullivan et al. 2008). Such dust structures may potentially be disrupted by\naerodynamic stresses that are significantly less than those required to initiate saltation of a plausible solid\n75\n\n\fsand-sized particle, injecting dust into the atmosphere without a need for stronger winds to initiate\nsaltation. Conditions within dust devils (see Section 5.3.2) may also enhance the abilities of those vortices\nto remove dust from the surface (e.g., Balme and Hagermann 2006, Neakrase and Greeley 2010b).\nDue to the large vertical thermal gradient capable of existing in the upper millimeter of the ground,\nthermophoresis has also been advanced as a possible mechanism (alone or in conjunction with another\nprocess) for dust injection into the atmosphere (e.g., Wurm et al. 2008). In this context, thermophoresis\noccurs when solar insolation warms the upper millimeter of the surface (dust particles and pore space gas\nmolecules) much more than the atmospheric gas molecules directly above. The higher temperature pore\nspace gas molecules can transfer enough momentum so that a subset of the surface dust particles are able\nto jump from the surface and be entrained by the atmosphere (overcoming gravity, the competing\nmomentum transfer from the cooler atmospheric gas molecules, and any interparticle cohesive forces).\nRapid sublimation of carbon dioxide ice that underlies or surrounds (e.g., as in dirty ice) dust particles\nmay also provide the impulse required to inject dust into the atmosphere (e.g., Holstein\u2010Rathlou et al.\n2010).\n4.2.2 Properties of martian dust\nThe average chemical composition of airborne and surficial dust on Mars is thought to be approximately\nconstant, since: 1) comparisons between landed and orbital spacecraft measurements indicate few, if any,\nsignificant differences in gross dust composition (cf., Bell, III, et al. 2000, Christensen et al. 2004,\nBandfield and Smith 2003, Aronson and Emslie 1975), and 2) the unfocused redeposition of dust on the\nsurface after planet-encircling dust storms and other forms of long-distance atmospheric mixing and\ntransport will tend to spatially homogenize the dust composition over time. Mechanical weathering (e.g.,\nimpact of saltating particles, thermal cycle stresses) of basaltic rocks across Mars is the presumed genesis\nof the majority of the dust (e.g., Pleskot and Miner 1981, Christensen 1988), although minor chemical\nalteration to the source rocks and/or generated dust may occur (e.g., Hamilton et al. 2005). One plausible\nbulk composition of the current Mars dust suggests composite particles made up of a large fraction of\nframework silicate minerals (such as plagioclase feldspar and zeolite) with lesser amounts of iron oxides\nsuch as hematite and magnetite, along with many other plausible minor components (Hamilton et al.\n2005). The iron oxides give Mars its reddish hue and cause much of the dust to be magnetic to varying\ndegrees (e.g., Goetz et al. 2005). Similar to terrestrial dust, martian dust likely exhibits a quasi-continuum\nof particle diameters, ranging from ten micrometers to much less than one micrometer \u2013 consistent with\navailable in situ observational studies such as Goetz et al. (2010).\n\n76\n\n\f5. Atmospheric dust-entrainment phenomena\nAs discussed in the previous chapter, dust emission is generated through saltation bombardment by winds\nthat exceed the saltation threshold. After discussing the main dust source regions on Earth in the next\nsection, we discuss the main meteorological features forcing dust emission on Earth (Section 5.1.2) and\nMars (Section 5.2). Section 5.3.2 also discusses a special case of dust lifting phenomena: small tornadolike vortices called dust devils that occur on both Earth and Mars.\n5.1 Dust storms on Earth\n5.1.1 Main source regions\nSatellite observations have shown that, on a global scale, the dominant sources of natural mineral dust\naerosols are located in the Northern Hemisphere and form what is called the 'Afro-Asian belt' of deserts\nor the 'dust belt' (Figure 5.1a). It stretches from the west coast of Africa all the way to Mongolia and\nChina through the Middle-East, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan (Middleton, 1986a, b; Prospero et al.,\n2002; Leon and Legrand, 2003). Within this dust belt, major dust activity is evident in the Sahara desert\nof North and West Africa, in the Arabian Peninsula, in the Middle East and in southwest and central Asia\nincluding Iran, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Northern India, the Namib and Kalahari deserts, the\nGobi desert in Mongolia and the Tarim Basin in China (e.g. Herman et al. 1997; Torres et al. 1998).\nSome minor dust activity occurs in the Great Basins (Western United States), in Mexico, in central\nAustralia, in southern Africa and in Bolivia (e.g. Engelstaedter et al., 2006, Huneeus et al. 2011). Global\ncirculation models estimate the global dust emission rate of PM20 dust to equal around 1000 \u2013 5000\nTg/year (Huneeus et al., 2011), although some models might underestimate the global dust emission rate\ndue to an underestimation of the emission of silt aerosols (Kok 2011a).\nMost active dust source areas in the Sahara are located in the foothills of mountain ranges, where\nfluvial abrasion provides sediments and deflatable materials (e.g. Middleton and Goudie, 2001,\nMahowald et al., 2003, Zender et al., 2003a; Schepanski et al., 2009). Also, dry lake beds, where fine\nsediments are abundantly present, constitute important dust source areas (Goudie and Middleton, 2001,\nProspero et al., 2002, Mahowald et al., 2003). In particular, the area of the paleo-lake of Chad, known as\nthe Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 Depression, is considered as the most important source of dust emissions in the Sahara\n(Prospero et al., 2002; Washington et al., 2003).\nIn Central and Eastern Asia, the major source regions are the Tarim Basin (Taklimakan Desert) in\nwestern China, the upper reach of the Yellow River (Gobi Desert) in southern Mongolia and northwestern\nChina, the east part of Inner Mongolia, and the northern part of the Indian Subcontinent (Figure 5.1b; Sun\net al. 2001).\n5.1.2 Main meteorological features forcing dust emission\nBased on the World Meteorological Organization protocol, dust events are classified according to\nvisibility into one of four categories (Shao, 2008). The first of these, dust haze, consists of aeolian dust\nparticles homogeneously suspended in the atmosphere. These are not actively entrained, but have been\nuplifted from the ground by a dust event that occurred prior to the time of observation or from a\nconsiderable distance. Visibility may sometimes be reduced to 10 km. Blowing dust is the state where\ndust is emitted locally through strong winds and at the time of observation, reducing visibility to 1 to 10\nkm. A dust storm is the result of strong turbulent winds entraining large quantities of dust particles,\nreducing visibility to between 200 meters and 1km. And finally, a severe dust storm is characterized by\nvery strong winds that uplift large quantities of dust particles, reducing visibility to less than 200 m.\nAll atmospheric phenomena forcing dust emission must generate strong wind speeds that exceed the\nlocal dust emission threshold (see Sections 2.1.1 and 4.1.1). The atmospheric phenomena that produce\ndust events are of a variety of scales, including synoptic, regional, local, as well as turbulent scales. In\nascending order of their length scales, important meteorological phenomena able to provide atmospheric\nconditions suitable for dust mobilization include dust devils (see Section 5.3.2), the downward turbulent\nmixing of momentum from nocturnal low-level jets (LLJs), density currents associated with moist-\n\n77\n\n\fconvection, cyclones, and synoptic scale cold fronts. We discuss these phenomena in the subsequent\nsections.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.1: (a) May-July seasonal mean for the period 1980\u20131992 of Aerosol Index (AI) derived from the Total\nOzone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) satellite observations showing the main dust sources on global scale forming\nthe dust belt (after Engelstaedter et al., 2006).

They are most commonly\nobserved at nighttime and can occur over all continents above both flat and complex terrain and may\nextend over tens to hundreds of kilometers (May, 1995; Davis, 2000; Schepanski et al., 2009). During\nnights with low surface wind speeds, near-surface air layers are well stratified and turbulence is\nsuppressed. In such conditions, air layers above the near-surface are frictionally decoupled from the\nsurface and hence are associated with high wind speeds (e.g. Hoxit, 1975, Garratt, 1992, Mauritsen and\nSvensson, 2007, Mahrt , 1999).\nAfter sunrise, convective turbulence arises with the onset of solar heating at the surface. The\ndecoupled air layer aloft becomes frictionally coupled to the surface, and LLJ momentum is mixed down\n(Blackadar, 1957, Lenschow and Stankov, 1979). As a consequence, high surface wind speeds occur until\nthe LLJ is eroded by the convection in the planetary boundary layer set on by the solar heating at the\nsurface. The LLJ peaks at nighttime while surface wind peaks in mid-morning when LLJ momentum is\nmixed down to the surface (Figure 5.2, Washington et al., 2006, Todd et al., 2008). Over the Sahara, LLJs\noccur under clear skies and low surface wind speed conditions (e.g. Thorpe and Guymer, 1977) and have\nbeen observed within the northeasterly 'Harmattan' flow (Washington and Todd, 2005). About 65% of\ndust activity over the Sahara is due to the break-down of the nocturnal LLJs (e.g. Schepanski et al., 2009).\nIn particular, dust emission throughout the year in the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 region in Chad is mainly related to LLJs\ndynamics (Washington et al., 2006).\n\nFigure 5.2: Illustration of Low Level Jets (LLJs) during the night (top) and the associated high near-surface wind\nspeeds during the morning hours (bottom). The lines represent streamlines of the atmospheric flow in the different\natmospheric layers.\n\n79\n\n\f5.1.2.2 Moist convection\nDeep moist convection and the associated downdrafts of cold, humid air is another meteorological\nphenomenon capable of generating the high surface wind speeds required for dust emission. Such\noutflows take the form of density currents and can propagate many hundreds of kilometers away from the\nparent convective system (Simpson, 1997; Williams et al; 2009). Over arid and semiarid areas, these\ndensity currents cause strong dust emission (of the order of 1 Tg per event (Bou Karam et al., 2011)).\nOver North and West Africa, such events are called 'haboobs' (Figure 5.3) and are observed during the\nsummer monsoon season. Haboobs are frequent during afternoons and evenings, when moist convection\nis at maximum (Sutton, 1925, Idso et al., 1972, Droegemeier and Wilhelmso, 1987, Flamant et al., 2007,\nBou Karam et al., 2008, 2011).\nDeep moist convection can also occur in mountain areas due to blocking of the atmospheric flow by\nthe orography. Large scale density currents can form resulting from the subsequent evaporative cooling of\ncloud particles or precipitation. The high surface wind speeds associated with these density currents can\nlead to dust emission over arid and semiarid areas (Droegemeier and Wilhelmson, 1987). Over the\nSahara, such dust events can be observed for example in the Atlas Mountains (Knippertz et al., 2007) and\nin the Hoggar Mountains domain (Cuesta et al., 2010).\n\nFigure 5.3: A density current emanating from a deep mesoscale convective system over Niger in summer 2006 and\nthe associated dust emission.\n\n5.1.2.3 Cyclones\nCyclones are considered as major dynamic features for the mobilization and the upward mixing of dust by\nvirtue of the associated strong near-surface cyclonic winds and convective turbulence (e.g. Liu et 2003;\nBou Karam et al., 2010). This mechanism operates in two steps; first the dust is mobilized by strong\nmomentum from the cyclonic surface wind and then it is mixed upward to high altitudes by the strong\nturbulence and the systemic ascending motion associated with the cyclone dynamics (Liu et al., 2003;\nBou Karam et al., 2010). For example, the Mongolian Cyclone (Figure 5.4a), affects eastern Asia in\nMarch, April and May. This intense system is associated with the East Asian trough (a trough is an\nelongated region of low atmospheric pressure, often associated with fronts) and leads to strong\nnorthwesterly near-surface winds up to 18 m s-1, thereby generating dust storms (Shao and Wang, 2003).\nIn general, Asian dust storms are mainly associated with cyclonic cold fronts during the surges of cold\n80\n\n\fcontinental air masses in late winter and early spring when most of the area is under the influence of the\npowerful Siberian\u2013Mongolian anticyclone (e.g. Watts, 1969; Littmann 1991).\nCyclones are also observed over the Sahara desert in spring months when temperature gradients\nbetween the North African coast and the Mediterranean Sea are strongest (Pedgley, 1972, Alpert and Ziv,\n1989, Trigo et al., 2002). Observations indicate a frequent initiation of Saharan cyclones on the leeward\nside east and south of the Atlas Mountains (Barkan et al., 2005, Prezerakos et al., 1990, Alpert et al.,\n1990, Alpert and Ziv, 1989). Hence, both the lee-effect of the mountains and the coastal thermal gradient\neffect can explain the spring cyclogenesis, initiated by the presence of an upper-level trough to the west\n(e.g. Horvath et al., 2006, Egger et al., 1995; Schepanski et al., 2009; Bou Karam et al., 2010). Saharan\ncyclones are characterized by an active warm front, heavy dust storms and low visibilities, and a sharp\ncold front that is well defined at the surface by changes in temperature of 10-20 K (5.4b). They move\nquickly eastward (faster than 10 ms-1) mostly following the North African coast (Alpert et al., 1990,\nAlpert and Ziv, 1989; Bou Karam et al., 2010). The dust load associated with Saharan cyclones is\nestimated to be of the order of 8 Tg per event (Bou Karam et al., 2010).\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 5.4: (a) Satellite image of the Mongolian dust Cyclone on 7 April 2001 taken by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution\nImaging Spectroradiometer) on NASA's Aqua satellite. The cyclone measured around 3 km vertically and up to 2000 km\nhorizontally. (b) Illustration of the main characteristics of the (Northern Hemisphere) Saharan Cyclone (Bou Karam et al.,\n2010).\n\n5.1.2.4 Synoptic scale cold fronts\nLarge and persistent outbreaks of dust over arid and semiarid regions can also be caused by cold fronts of\nsynoptic scale (e.g., Figs. 1.1a and 5.5). These cold fronts mainly originate from the penetration of upperlevel troughs from high latitudes into low latitudes (e.g. Jankowiak and Tanr\u00e9, 1992; Knippertz and Fink,\n2006; Tulet et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2003). The dust fronts generated during these events are related to\ndensity currents caused by strong evaporative cooling along the precipitating cloud-band that accompany\nthe penetration of the upper-level cold front into arid regions (e.g. Knippertz and Fink, 2006). During\nsuch storms, the dust is pushed ahead of the cold front into the rising warm air over the desert. Over\nnorthern China, most of the dust storms during spring are caused by cold fronts that form in connection\nwith the dynamic of the Siberian High.\nFurthermore, cold-front dust emission can occur together with the surge of monsoon flows from the\nocean toward the continent. Bou Karam et al. (2008) have identified this new mechanism for dust\n81\n\n\femission over West Africa during the summer monsoon season. Highly turbulent winds at the leading\nedge of the monsoon nocturnal flow in the Inter Tropical Front ((ITF), the ITF marks the interface in the\nlower atmosphere between the moist southwesterly monsoon flow and the hot and dry northeasterly\nharmattan flow over Africa) region have been identified to generate dust uplifting. Also, Marsham et al.,\n(2008) have described, via in situ measurements, the characteristics of the dusty layer at the leading edge\nof the monsoon flow over West Africa. Bou Karam et al., (2009) have estimated dust emission associated\nwith the nocturnal monsoon flow over Niger to be of the order of 0.7 Tg per day. This mechanism is most\nactive during the night when the monsoonal surge usually occurs.\n\nFigure 5.5: False-color image derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) satellite\nobservations on March 2006 showing a synoptic cold front and the associated dust storm (pink and magenta colors)\nover Africa.\n\n5.2 Dust storms on Mars\nThe vast dust storms that sporadically occur on Mars play an important role in defining the planet's\nclimate and surface expression (Kahn et al. 1992). Compared to aeolian dust storms on Earth, those on\nMars are often larger, deeper (40 km or more), and longer-lasting (tens of Mars-days) (e.g., Kahn et al.\n1992, Cantor et al. 2001). These phenomena are also an integral part of Mars' seasonal dust cycle, which\nstrongly modulates the planet's climate, by significantly altering the absorption and/or emission of\ninfrared and visible radiation by the atmosphere and surface (e.g., Gierasch and Goody 1968, Kahn et al.\n1992). The following subsections explore the general processing and transport of atmospheric dust within\nMars' atmosphere and the current understanding of the (more visually explicit) dust storms.\n5.2.1 Atmospheric transport and processing of martian dust\nOnce airborne, dust on Mars is acted upon by three primary genres of physical processes: 1) direct\ngravitational sedimentation, 2) particle scavenging and alteration by water- and CO2-ice cloud\nmicrophysical processes, and 3) transport and mixing by many scales of atmospheric circulations. A\ncontinuous dust loading within the lower atmosphere which varies on seasonal and faster time scales (e.g.,\nPollack et al. 1979, Smith 2004) is maintained by these processes. The overall depth of this dust loading\nvaries with season and location, but in general may be as shallow as the planetary boundary layer depth\n(wide range between 0-15 km; cf. Hinson et al., 2008) and perhaps as deep as 70 km or more based on\nMars Express SPICAM results (Spectroscopy for Investigation of Characteristics of the Atmosphere of\nMars; e.g., Montmessin et al. 2006). The vertical distribution of dust mixing ratio (i.e., the ratio of dust\nmass to atmospheric mass in a given volume) generally cannot be considered constant with height,\n82\n\n\falthough historically such a simplifying assumption has been widely used (e.g., Haberle et al. 1993,\nForget et al. 1999). Instead, recent observations show that an elevated peak of dust mixing ratio at\napproximately 15-25 km often exists (e.g., McCleese et al. 2010), and it is likely that dust mixing ratio\nalso peaks within the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Although robust observational confirmation of this\nlocal maximum within the PBL does not yet exist for Mars, it is assumed similar to what has been\nobserved in Earth's atmosphere over deserts, since the PBL is where the atmospheric dust\nemission/injection occurs, and above the PBL vertical atmospheric transport of dust is significantly\nhindered by a temperature inversion (e.g., Arya 1999).\nThe terminal fall speed of a particle, driven by gravity and counteracted by external fluid drag,\ndepends strongly on its shape, size, and the mass density of the ambient atmospheric medium, among\nother parameters (e.g., Pruppacher and Klett, 1997). The proportion of small to large dust particles in the\natmosphere increases nonlinearly with altitude, due to the increasingly disparate fall speeds of the larger\nversus the smaller particles. This gravitational sedimentation process also results in semi-continuous dust\ndeposition at the surface, as observed in situ by every successful Mars lander (e.g., Bell, III, et al. 2000,\nGoetz et al. 2005, Vaughan et al. 2010).\nDust particles also likely serve as condensation nuclei for water- and CO2-ice cloud particles on Mars\n(e.g., Colaprete et al. 1999, Colaprete and Toon 2002). The resulting ice crystals are significantly larger\nthan the dust that they nucleated on (now entombed), and thus generally have a correspondingly higher\nterminal fall speed. Larger dust particles will generally nucleate ice crystals before smaller ones do, due to\nmicrophysical considerations (Pruppacher and Klett 1997). This process can both dramatically enhance\nthe descent rate of all sizes of dust and impede the upward or lateral transport of dust through areas of the\natmosphere where conditions are conducive for ice-cloud formation.\nTo maintain and modulate the observed atmospheric dust loading over seasonal (and shorter)\ntimescales in the presence of gravitational sedimentation, there must be vertical and horizontal transport\nprocesses within the atmosphere which resupply the higher reaches of Mars' atmosphere with dust.\nSignificant dust emission events (or dust storms; see Section 5.2.2, below) and small-scale vertical\nvortices (dust devils; see Section 5.3.2, below) are clearly part of this process. However, it is unclear that,\ntaken alone, these two types of readily observable atmospheric phenomena can fully explain the observed\ndetails of the atmospheric dust loading for myriad reasons, which include the dust storms' stochasticity (in\ntime) and the dust devils' confinement to the planetary boundary layer.\nNumerical atmospheric models have been used to provide insight into further (nearly invisible)\ncirculations that may play important roles in redistributing dust on Mars. Modeling studies generally\nagree that larger-scale horizontal circulations are both present and capable of redistributing airborne dust\nlaterally. However, the nature of the vertical circulations needed to maintain the depth of the atmospheric\ndust loading is less clear. Global circulation model (GCM) studies, which typically use relatively coarse\ncomputational grids (i.e., with grid cells that are rarely less than 3x3 degrees in latitude and longitude, or\n~180x180 km at the equator), have suggested that broad-area rising motions (seasonally varying, but\noccurring every day) along with saltation-based and dust devil dust emission processes may provide the\nmechanism by which the global dust loading is continuously maintained (e.g., Newman et al. 2002, Basu\net al. 2004, Kahre et al. 2006). However, some higher-resolution (i.e., 5-40 km grid cells) atmospheric\nmodeling studies have suggested that: 1) deep (up to ~60 km above the areoid) vertical transport is\nthermally-induced on a daily basis by the largest mountains on Mars (e.g., those of the Tharsis plateau),\nand appears capable of creating and maintaining the observed depth of the atmospheric dust loading (e.g.,\nRafkin et al. 2002, Michaels et al. 2006), and 2) vertical jets thermally-forced by smaller-scale severe\ntopography (e.g., the rims of larger craters, canyon walls) effectively pierce the top of the planetary\nboundary layer (PBL), allowing dust that is otherwise trapped within the PBL to be entrained into largerscale horizontal circulations between approximately 5-20 km above the surface (e.g., Rafkin and Michaels\n2003, Michaels et al. 2006). Note that when spatially and temporally averaged, these two types of\nphenomena would approximate the broad-area rising motions discussed by the previously mentioned\nGCM studies (e.g., Rafkin 2011).\n\n83\n\n\f5.2.2 A menagerie of Mars dust storms\nMars is a desert planet (by terrestrial standards) with a substantial and dynamic atmosphere, so it is not\nsurprising that it exhibits a broad range of dust storm activity. As on Earth (Section 5.1.2), martian dust\nstorms often have a morphology that hint at the atmospheric phenomena (e.g., cold fronts, thermallydriven slope circulations) responsible for their genesis and evolution (e.g., Kahn et al. 1992). Opaque dust\nclouds associated with martian dust events commonly have a \"cauliflower\" appearance (e.g., Strausberg\net al. 2005; see Figures 5.6 and 5.7), caused by atmospheric convection (turbulence) that is likely\nsignificantly driven by radiative transfer attributable to the dust itself. Sand-sized particles are unlikely to\nbe a significant component of the airborne material more than several meters from the surface (e.g.,\nAlmeida et al. 2008) within a dust storm on Mars, unlike on Earth, due to the relatively thin martian\natmosphere (global mean surface pressure of ~6 hPa, and thus greater particle fall speeds; see Figure\n2.19).\nThe causation of many Mars dust storms is still largely unknown, in large part due to a paucity of\nrelevant in situ meteorological observations. Clearly, however, one or more dust emission processes (see\nSection 4.2.2) must be operating, nearly all of which require a substantial near-surface horizontal wind\nmagnitude. Although dust devils (see section 5.3.2) are common phenomena that enhance relatively calm\nwinds at smaller scales, spacecraft observations suggest that dust storms are not triggered by such activity\n(e.g., Cantor et al. 2002, Balme et al. 2003, Cantor et al. 2006). Wind gusts due to boundary layer\nconvective turbulence may also be capable of spontaneously initiating dust emission processes (Fenton\nand Michaels 2010), but since this process occurs on a daily basis over much of Mars, an infrequent\ntriggering event (e.g., the passage of a front) appears necessary to generate a dust event this way.\nIt is also not well constrained when and where the surface dust emission is actually occurring during a\ngiven storm. Current observational capabilities for Mars relevant to measuring dust entrainment activity\ncover only the middle and late afternoon hours well. Even in the available afternoon images, the height of\nthe dust cloud tops is uncertain, and as such poorly constrains whether the dust emission at the surface\nmirrors the spatial distribution of the dust clouds (or is still occurring at all). All clouds of dust are subject\nto transport by the atmosphere, and may potentially translate with their progenitor disturbance long after\ndust emission has ceased.\n\nFigure 5.6. Examples of early spring dust storms associated with the retreated north polar seasonal cap of Mars\n(brighter circular feature). A mosaic of approximate-color wide angle images from NASA Mars Global Surveyor's\nMars Orbiter Camera, taken in 2002 (note that this mosaic exhibits a significantly limited range of local times due to\nthe spacecraft's orbit). At least three arcuate dust events are visible. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science\nSystems.\n\n84\n\n\fPolar cap dust storms (see example in Figure 5.6) are perhaps the best understood of Mars dust\nstorms. These dust events typically are of the local, and rarely, the regional dust storm varieties of Martin\nand Zurek (1993) and Cantor et al. (2001). In the classification scheme of Cantor et al. (2001) regional\ndust storms (areal coverage of >= 1.6x106 km2) have a duration of >3 sols (Mars-days), and local dust\nstorms exhibit a lesser areal extent and duration. This type of dust storm typically occurs in local spring\nand summer along and near the retreating seasonal carbon dioxide ice cap. Their commonly curvilinear\nmorphology, circumpolar translation, and common occurrence strongly suggest that strong winds\nassociated with cold fronts trigger these events (e.g., Barnes et al. 1993, James et al. 1999, Cantor et al.\n2001). The lag deposit of dust left behind by the sublimation of dusty CO2 ice in the retreating seasonal\ncap may also provide an additional dust source for these phenomena (James et al. 1999). Figure 5.6\nillustrates (at the upper left of the image) that such storms can also extend significantly over the ice cap.\n\nFigure 5.7. Example of a regional dust storm over the Thaumasia region of Mars (in the midlatitudes of the southern\nhemisphere). A Viking Orbiter 2 image (176B02) acquired in 1977. The textured cloud of dust is approximately\n1000 km in length. Soon after this image was obtained, this storm became the progenitor of the first planetencircling dust storm observed by the two Viking Orbiter spacecraft.\n\nLocal and regional (non-polar) dust storms (see example in Figure 5.7) are also relatively common on\nMars, with hundreds occurring each Mars-year without a bias towards either the north or south\nhemisphere (Cantor et al. 2001). Some of these storms originate in the high latitudes and travel\nequatorward, with a subset even crossing the equator (e.g., Cantor et al. 2001, Wang et al. 2003).\nOccasional, cooperative interaction between different types of atmospheric circulations may explain the\noccurrence and behavior of such storms (Wang et al. 2003, Wang 2007). Other forms of these dust events\nmay be ultimately due to similar interactions between slope winds, atmospheric tides, and other\natmospheric phenomena. Approximately half of all regional dust storms appear to result from the merger\n85\n\n\fof two or more local dust storms (Cantor et al. 2001). Similarly, planet-encircling dust storms seem to\nresult from the combined effects of multiple regional events (e.g., Cantor 2007). Regional dust events can\nresult in an enhanced surface dust cover (often temporary) over areas downwind as entrained dust falls\nout of the atmosphere (e.g., Thomas and Veverka 1979, Geissler 2005).\nA planet-encircling dust storm on Mars (see example in Figure 1.2b) is a dust event that shrouds one\nor both hemispheres of the planet in dust for hundreds of sols (Martin and Zurek 1993, Cantor 2007) (up\nto a season in duration; the polar regions often escape much of the dust pall). These events generally\noccur stochastically with a multiyear incidence (e.g., 1971, 1973, 1977a, 1977b, 2001) (Martin and Zurek\n1993, Cantor 2007). The genesis of such an event is not clear, but appears to involve one or more\nrelatively discrete regional dust storms intensifying and somehow inducing additional lifting centers\n(areas where surface dust emission is occurring) near the edge of the overall area of dust obscuration as it\nexpands, which leads to a great quantity of entrained dust that is spread more globally by the atmospheric\ncirculation (e.g., Thorpe 1979, Cantor 2007). Dust can be lofted to 60 km or more in altitude during these\nevents (Cantor 2007). It is widely believed that a primary mechanism by which the dust emission of such\na storm ends is when the associated dust pall modifies the atmospheric circulation and structure in a way\nthat inhibits further lifting centers from forming, largely via the radiative transfer effects of the\natmospheric dust loading (e.g., Pollack et al. 1979). Widespread enhanced surface dust cover results from\na planet-encircling dust storm, but appears to be sporadically removed (generally at a rate that does not\nproduce significant clouds of dust) as the atmosphere gradually clears (e.g., Thomas and Veverka 1979,\nGeissler 2005, Cantor 2007).\n5.3 Dust entrainment by small-scale vertical vortices on Earth and Mars\nThe dust storm discussions in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 implicitly excluded smaller-scale and more ephemeral\natmospheric dust entrainment phenomena. Chief among these, especially in terms of instantaneous dust\nmass flux (due to sustained wind speeds much greater than ambient conditions), are the near-surface\nvertical vortices. A quasi-continuum of such vortices are a natural consequence of three-dimensional\natmospheric thermodynamics, and they can conveniently be classified by energy source.\n5.3.1 Vertical vortices with greater sources of energy\nTornadoes, the vertical vortex type with the greatest near-surface wind magnitude (often 100 m s-1 or\nmore), are ultimately powered by the release of latent heat due to the phase change of water substance in\nthe atmosphere (e.g., cloud formation). The quantity of water substance in Mars' atmosphere is far too\nsmall to support similar phenomena. These phenomena have the potential to entrain large quantities of\ndust and other particulates. However, their relative rarity, geographically-limited occurrence, and a\nfrequent association with rain and other precipitation hampers the overall dust emission and transport\neffectiveness of these phenomena.\nA second genre of small-scale vertical vortices are those which derive most of their energy from\nsignificant wind shear. On Earth, examples include what are colloquially termed \"gustnadoes\" (along\nthunderstorm gust fronts; Bluestein 1980) and \"mountainadoes\" (horizontal vortices tilted into the vertical\nby significant topographic obstacles; Bergen 1976), with typical near-surface wind magnitudes less than\nor equal to that of a weak tornado. Like tornadoes, their relative rarity limits the overall significance of\ntheir dust entrainment effects.\nSuch vortices powered by wind shear are theoretically possible on Mars, due to complex topography\nand widespread slope flows (i.e., winds driven by heating/cooling imbalances along a significant\ntopographic slope). However, no observational detections/identifications have yet been made. This could\npotentially be due to the limited temporal coverage of relevant high-resolution orbital spacecraft imaging\n(only in the mid-afternoon), or perhaps due to obscuration from adjacent larger-scale dust lifting\nphenomena.\n\n86\n\n\fFigure 5.8.

This particular dust devil persisted for ~15 minutes before dissipating.\n\n5.3.2 Dust devils\nA third category of small-scale vertical vortices, powered by near-surface thermal buoyancy, are\ncommonly termed devils (dust devils being of particular relevance here). Such circulations are more\ngenerally referred to as vertical convective vortices, which reflects their causation and control by\nthermally-forced boundary layer convection (i.e., the structured near-surface turbulence induced by a\nlarge temperature imbalance between the ground and the adjacent atmosphere). It is important to note that\na given dust devil circulation may not be visible if there is no available dust to entrain, the circulation\ndoes not extend fully to the surface, or if the circulation is too weak to entrain dust. An excellent and\nthorough review of Earth and Mars dust devil literature was published in 2006 (Balme and Greeley 2006),\nand thus the discussion here will concentrate on comparing the dust devils on the two planets and\nincluding recent findings.\nVisible dust devils are relatively common during the daytime in the arid/semiarid areas of Earth, and\nover nearly all of Mars, since the sun-warmed ground provides the energy needed to drive boundary layer\nconvection. The diameter of terrestrial dust devils ranges from less than a meter to tens of meters, and\nthey range in height from a meter to hundreds of meters (e.g., Balme and Greeley 2006, Lorenz 2011;\nexample in Figure 5.8). In contrast, those on Mars (examples in Figure 5.9) can be significantly larger, up\nto 8 km in height and hundreds of meters in diameter (Fisher et al. 2005). These maximum dimensions\ncan largely be explained by a greater solar energy (absorbed by the surface) to atmospheric mass ratio on\nMars (tens of times greater than that on Earth), providing martian dust devils with a more effective power\n87\n\n\fsource. The duration of these vortices on both worlds is thought to be similar, a few seconds to thousands\nof seconds (Michaels and Rafkin 2004, Balme and Greeley 2006).\n\nFigure 5.9.

Image credit:\nNASA/JPL/Cornell/USGS\n\nThe structure of a typical dust devil on Earth or Mars consists of a vortex tube in which the walls are\ncomposed of an intense dusty helical updraft and the core is relatively dust-free and calm away from the\nsurface. At the top of the vortex tube, dust begins to horizontally disperse while continuing to move\nupwards, as it becomes entrained in the larger-scale boundary layer convective updraft associated with the\ndust devil. At the bottom of the vortex, surface material is scoured from the surface largely by large\ntangential winds within the vortex wall (Balme et al. 2003) (see Chapters 2 and 4 for more discussion of\nsurface particle emission). On Earth, the most massive particles (usually sand or small clumps of soil)\ndetrain quickly from the vortex and often create an \"ejecta skirt\" (Metzger 1999) of material falling back\nto the surface that surrounds the lowest meters of the vortex. Obvious ejecta skirts have not typically been\nobserved on Mars (Neakrase and Greeley 2010b), although it must be noted that such features are quite\ndifficult to identify in orbital imagery, and in situ imaging has been limited to a few sites.\n\nFigure 5.10. Example of orbitally observed dust devil tracks on Mars at ~69.5\u00b0S (north is to the left; area of ~66x20\nkm with a pixel size of ~19 m). Note the concentrations of dark dust devil tracks. Mars Odyssey THEMIS image\nV33501003 (Christensen et al. 2011).\n\nDust devils can leave an aerially and/or orbitally visible surface trace of their passage, commonly\ntermed a \"track\". Such features are relatively rare on Earth, likely because the mobile particulates and\nunderlying substrate lack sufficient visible contrast. However, numerous dark (and many fewer bright)\ndust devil tracks are visible on many areas of the Mars' surface (example in Figure 5.10, often exhibiting\ncomplex loops and turns that are indicative of the dynamical convective boundary layer processes that the\nphenomena were embedded in (e.g., Malin and Edgett 2001, Michaels 2006). Numerical modeling\nsuggests that on Mars, the width of some dust devil tracks may only be representative of the dust devil\nradius (versus diameter) (Michaels 2006), due largely to the much higher wind speed threshold for\n88\n\n\fparticle entrainment on Mars versus Earth (see Section 2.4). Areas where martian dust devil tracks are\nconcentrated exhibit a significantly altered albedo (versus adjacent areas without such tracks), affecting\nthe surface temperature and potentially local- and regional-scale atmospheric circulations (Malin and\nEdgett 2001, Michaels 2006, Fenton et al. 2007).\nDue in large part to their common occurrence on Earth and especially Mars, dust devils act as an\nimportant conduit for the atmospheric entrainment of dust and other surface particulates within the\nboundary layer (i.e., to a height from the surface of approximately 1-4 and more km on Earth, and 1-10\nand more km on Mars). In regions prone to dust devil activity on Earth, air quality (specifically with\nregard to particulate content) is reduced due to the dust aerosols generated by these phenomena (Gillette\nand Sinclair 1990, Mattsson et al. 1993), adding significantly to any air quality reduction attributable to\nnon-vortical processes (e.g., dry boundary layer convection) alone. Such aerosols may subsequently have\nsignificant effects on the atmospheric energy budget via their modulation of cloud formation processes\n(acting as cloud condensation and ice nuclei (Twomey 1974, DeMott et al. 2003) and their additional\nscattering and absorption of incoming and outgoing electromagnetic radiation (chiefly in the visible and\ninfrared regions of the spectrum). The significance of such effects attributable solely to dust devils on\nEarth has not yet been well quantified (Koch and Renno 2005), but is likely far from negligible (e.g.,\nBalkanski et al 2007, Mahowald et al. 2010, Kok 2011a). Mars global climate modeling work suggests\nthat these two potential indirect effects of dust devils may have significant roles in the planet's climate\n(e.g., Newman et al. 2002, Basu et al. 2004, Wilson et al. 2008), since dust devils potentially contribute a\nlarge fraction of the ever-present atmospheric dust loading (Basu et al. 2004). It has been estimated that\nmartian dust devils may entrain 2.3 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 1011 kg of surface material annually, a significant fraction of\nthat likely entrained by local and regional dust storms (Whelley and Greeley 2008).\n\n89\n\n\f6. Conclusions and remaining questions\nAs shown in the previous chapters, the past decade has produced considerable progress in understanding\nthe physics of wind-blown sand and dust. Some of the most critical advances include an improved\nunderstanding of the characteristics of steady state saltation from advances in theory, numerical models,\nand wind tunnel experiments (Section 2.3); important insights into the physics of aeolian ripples and\ndunes and into the origin of complex dune shapes gained through both numerical modeling and cleverly\ndesigned experiments (Section 3.3); the discovery of plausible mechanisms to move sand and lift dust on\nMars (Sullivan et al. 2008, Kok 2010b, Fenton and Michaels 2010), thereby starting to reconcile the\nconundrum of widespread aeolian activity (e.g., Cantor et al. 2001, Bridges et al. 2012a) despite Mars'\nthin atmosphere; and an improved understanding of the main atmospheric dust-lifting phenomena over\narid and semi-arid areas on Earth, including the insight that strong early morning near-surface winds\nresulting from the breakdown of the low-level jet are likely responsible for a substantial fraction of dust\nemissions over the Sahara (Knippertz 2008, Schepanski et al. 2009).\nDespite these advances, many important questions concerning the physics of wind-blown sand and\ndust remain. Some of these questions are outlined in the next section.\n6.1 Important remaining questions regarding the physics of wind-blown sand\nOne of the foremost remaining questions in understanding the physics of aeolian saltation is the effect of\nvariability on short time scales (~1 \u2013 100 sec; Baas 2006) on the time-averaged properties of saltation,\nsuch as the mass flux. In particular, saltation in the field is often intermittent (Stout and Zobeck 1997),\nwith bursts of saltation flux occurring in aeolian streamers (Baas and Sherman 2005). However,\ntheoretical and numerical models of saltation have generally not accounted for this variability. Instead,\nmost models have treated saltation as a uniform and continuous process at a constant wind shear stress\n(e.g. Anderson and Haff 1988, 1991, Werner 1990, Kok and Renno 2009a). A critical remaining\nchallenge is thus to understand how the turbulence characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer\ndetermine the variability in saltation transport (Sch\u00f6nfeldt 2003, Baas 2006), and how that variability\naffects the time-averaged properties of saltation. Moreover, in order to help translate insights into\nvariability on short time scales to advances in modeling saltation, dune formation, and dust emission on\nlonger time scales, future research needs to better relate the turbulence characteristics of the near-surface\nlayer in which saltation takes place to the meteorological forcing of the boundary layer (e.g. Hunt and\nCarlotti 2001).\nIn addition to the effect of saltation intermittency on time-averaged saltation properties, there are\nseveral other important remaining questions in the physics of wind-blown sand. For instance, what is the\neffect of dust and sand electrification on the characteristics of saltation (Zheng et al. 2003, Kok and\nRenno 2006, 2008) and possibly on atmospheric chemistry on Mars (Atreya et al. 2006, Farrell et al.\n2006, Kok and Renno 2009b)? What is the effect of saltation on the turbulence intensity (Taniere et al.\n1997, Nishimura and Hunt 2000, Zhang et al. 2008, Li and McKenna Neuman 2012) and the Lagrangian\n(correlation) time scale of the turbulence in the saltation layer (Anderson 1987b, Kok and Renno 2009a),\nand how does that affect the properties of saltation? What is the cause of the substantial underestimation\nof the aerodynamic roughness length measured in wind tunnel studies compared to field studies (Sherman\nand Farrell 2008) and what limit does this discrepancy impose on the extent to which wind tunnel studies\ncan be used to understand natural saltation? And does the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant (\uf06b) depend on the\nsaltation load (Li et al. 2010, Sherman and Li 2012), and, if so, how does that affect theoretical\npredictions of the mass flux and other saltation properties?\nAnswering the above questions will improve our ability to quantitatively model saltation transport,\nwhich is critical for improving our understanding of the formation and dynamics of ripples and dunes. For\ninstance, one of the key remaining issues for successfully modeling planetary dunes is an understanding\nof what controls the flux saturation length (Ls) that dictates the length scale of dunes (Section 3.1).\nAlthough there is strong experimental evidence supporting a scaling of Ls with the grain diameter\nmultiplied by the grain-to-fluid density ratio under different physical conditions (Section 3.1), a\nsignificant dependence of Ls on the shear velocity of the driving fluid is observed for subaqueous saltation\n90\n\n\f(Dur\u00e1n et al. 2011a). Because of the large atmospheric density on Venus and Titan compared with that on\nEarth or Mars, sand transport on Venus and Titan is expected to be much more akin to subaqueous\nsaltation than to its aeolian counterpart (Section 2.4). To correctly model dune and ripple dynamics under\ndifferent environmental conditions, it is thus critical to achieve an improved physical description of the\nsand flux and flux saturation length that accounts for the differences in transport mechanisms due to these\ndifferences. Furthermore, the dependence of the saltation fluid threshold on the local slope could also play\na role for the selection of the minimal dune size (Andreotti and Claudin 2007, Parteli et al. 2007b), and\nthe relevance of this bed slope effect for the dune shape should thus be investigated in future modeling.\nAlso, as discussed in Section 3.2, important weaknesses of current dune models must be addressed in the\nfuture, such as the modeling of the separation bubble at the lee and the inclusion of secondary flow\neffects, which can play a fundamental role for the shape of seif and star dunes (Lancaster 1989a, b, Tsoar\n2001). In regards to ripples, the theoretical prediction that the steady-state height and spacing of ripples\nshould be independent of the wind friction velocity (Manukyan and Prigozhin 2009) should be\nexperimentally verified (Andreotti et al. 2006). Also, Martian TARs (Section 3.3) still pose an intriguing\npuzzle for planetary geomorphologists, as these bedforms could not be unambiguously classified as\nripples, megaripples or dunes. Modeling could potentially shed light into the mechanisms at play in the\nformation of these unique Martian bedforms.\nAlthough numerical modeling has yielded many important insights into the mobility and dynamics of\nMartian dunes, further critical insights are currently arising from images taken by the HiRISE camera on\nboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has an unprecedented resolution of about ~30 cm. These\nimages show that planet-wide displacements of ripples and dunes from several centimeters up to a few\nmeters are currently taking place within a time-scale of a few months or years (e.g., Hansen et al. 2011,\nBridges et al. 2012a), a scenario that contrasts with earlier expectations that saltation events should be\nrather rare on Mars (Arvidson et al. 1983, Moore 1985, Sullivan et al. 2005). As discussed in Section 2.4,\nrecent models of saltation yield a surprisingly low martian impact threshold velocity (Almeida et al. 2008,\nKok 2010a, b) which remains to be verified experimentally using wind tunnel simulations in a Martian\natmosphere (White 1979). Could the observed high rates of bedform migration on Mars be explained by a\nlow impact threshold velocity? While it is not yet possible to draw conclusions about dune stability and\ndynamics from the newest satellite observations, important questions regarding the mechanisms\nresponsible for the surficial modifications detected on the surface of some Martian dunes could be\ninvestigated with the help of modeling.\n6.2 Important remaining questions regarding the physics of wind-blown dust\nOne of the critical remaining questions in the physics of wind-blown dust is the dependence of the\nvertical dust flux on wind and soil conditions (Section 4.1.2). Although more physically-based models of\nthe vertical dust flux have been developed over the past decade (Marticorena and Bergametti 1995, Shao\net al. 1996, Alfaro and Gomes 2001, Shao 2001, 2004, Kok 2011a), substantial uncertainties in their\npredictions remain (e.g., Shao et al. 2011b and Figure 4.2). In particular, we have an inadequate\nunderstanding of the dependence of the dust flux on soil moisture, non-erodible elements, biological and\nphysical crusts, and other soil parameters (e.g., Shao 2001, Okin 2008). Moreover, some dust emission\nschemes require soil parameters that are not usually available on regional or global scales (Alfaro and\nGomes 2001, Shao 2001, 2004). As a consequence, most atmospheric circulation model parameterizations\nof the dust flux are based on semi-empirical relations fitted to measurements of the vertical dust flux as a\nfunction of wind speed for specific soil conditions (e.g., Ginoux et al. 2001, Zender et al. 2003a,\nBalkanski et al. 2007). But since dust emission occurs for a wide range of soils (Gillette 1979, Nickling\nand Gillies 1993), such parameterizations probably fail to capture a substantial part of the complex\ndependence of the vertical dust flux on wind and soil conditions (Gillette, 1974, McKenna Neuman et al.\n2009). In order to facilitate the development of improved physically-based dust flux parameterizations for\nimplementation into atmospheric circulation models, a range of questions relating the movement of soil\nparticles in saltation to the resulting vertical dust flux need to be answered. For instance, how does the\nstrength and variability of interparticle forces acting on dust in soil aggregates depend on soil moisture,\n91\n\n\fthe soil size distribution, and soil mineralogy? What is the balance between dust emission due to dust\naggregate fragmentation (Kok 2011a) and due to other processes, such as the removal of clay coatings on\nsand particles (Bullard et al. 2004)? How do vegetation characteristics such as porosity and spatial\ndistribution affect the dust flux (Okin 2008, Okin et al. 2011)? And how do the turbulent properties of the\nnear-surface flow affect dust emissions? A better understanding of these and other pertinent questions\nshould facilitate more physically realistic parameterizations of the vertical dust flux as a function of wind\nspeed and soil conditions.\nIn addition to an improved understanding of the small-scale physics of dust emission, improving the\nfidelity of simulations of the global dust cycle and its role in the Earth system also requires an improved\nunderstanding of the meteorological phenomena forcing dust emission. For instance, although numerous\natmospheric phenomena for dust lifting have been identified during the last decade (see Section 5.1.2),\ntheir relative importance as well as their seasonal and annual frequency remain to be quantified by future\nstudies. Another important remaining concern in modeling the dust cycle in regional and global models is\naccounting for the occurrence of small-scale atmospheric dust-lifting phenomena (Cakmur et al. 2004,\nKoch and Renno 2005, Williams 2008). For instance, dust emissions induced by small-scale turbulent\nwinds, such as the strong near-surface winds associated with cold fronts and density currents, need to be\nbetter parameterized in models (Cakmur et al. 2004). Furthermore, dust emission associated with\nconvective activity, such as dust fronts induced by mesoscale convective systems, need to be better\nunderstood (e.g. Reinfried et al. 2009, Bou Karam et al. 2011).\nA substantial number of questions also remain regarding aspects of wind-blown dust and sand\nparticular to Mars. Similar to Earth, there is an inadequate understanding of the influence of ground crusts\nand other cohesive phenomena on dust and sand transport. Furthermore, due to the existence of only a\nhandful of relevant in situ observations and measurements on the entire planet (e.g., Soderblom et al.\n2004, Goetz et al. 2010), the spatial distribution of such cohesive phenomena, surface sediment size\ndistribution, aerodynamic surface roughness, and other similar properties is not well constrained. What\nare the sources and sinks for mobile surface particles (e.g., Pleskot and Miner 1981, Christensen 1988)?\nHow well do they stand up to the rigors of participating in aeolian processes over martian geologic\ntimescales (e.g., 10 thousand, 1 million, or even 1 billion years)? Clearly, measurable aeolian sand\ntransport is occurring on contemporary Mars in several locales (e.g., Bridges et al. 2012a), but how much\nis due to the time-integrated effect of lower-mass-flux day-to-day occurrences versus much rarer highmass-flux stochastic events (e.g., Chojnacki et al. 2011)? What are the relative importance of dust devils,\nstochastic dust storms, and topographically-induced circulations in maintaining the nearly ever-present\natmospheric dust loading on Mars (Newman et al. 2002, Basu et al. 2004, Kahre et al. 2006, Michaels et\nal. 2006, Rafkin 2011)? How are martian dust storms triggered, particularly the rarer planet-encircling\nvariety? How do such dust storms intensify, and what leads to their decay? A combination of further\norbital observations and in situ measurements, numerical modeling, and laboratory experiments are\nneeded to address these questions.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Orencio Dur\u00e1n, Thomas P\u00e4htz, Oscar Matthews, Yaping Shao,\nThomas Gill, Earle Williams, Christopher Hugenholtz, Rob Sullivan, and Ralph Lorenz for helpful\ndiscussions, Mark Gordon for recalculating the splash data in Gordon and McKenna Neuman (2011) for\nuse in Figure 2.6, Haim Tsoar for providing the sand roses used in Figure 3.4, Sebastian Engelstaedter for\nproviding us with Figure 5.1a, and Thomas P\u00e4htz, Jack Gillies, and Rob Sullivan for helpful comments on\nparts of the manuscript.
