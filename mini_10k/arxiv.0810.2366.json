We uniquely define these states through two generalized clustering conditions: they vanish\nwhen either a cluster of k + 2 electrons is put together, or when two clusters of k + 1 electrons are\nformed at different positions. For Abelian Fractional Quantum Hall states (k = 1), our construction\nreproduces the Jain quasielectron wavefunction, and elucidates the difference between the Jain and\nLaughlin quasielectrons. For two (or more) quasielectrons, our states differ from those constructed\nusing Jain's method. By adding our quasielectrons to the Laughlin state, we obtain a hierarchy\nscheme which gives rise the non-Abelian non-unitary \u03bd = 25 FQH Gaffnian state.\nPACS numbers: 73.43.f, 11.25.Hf\n\nThe connection between conformal field theory (CFT)\nand Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states [1, 2] provides model wavefunctions for non-Abelian ground states\nand their quasihole excitations. A central result of the\nCFT-FQH connection has been the prediction that the\naddition of several units of flux creates multiple degenerate pinned quasihole states which exhibit non-Abelian\nstatistics. In particular, some of the Read-Rezayi (RR)[3]\nseries of non-Abelian states are thought to be experimentally relevant to the \u03bd = 5/2 and \u03bd = 12/5 FQH plateaus.\nDespite these successes, the FQH/CFT connection\nhas failed to produce unique model wavefunctions for\nthe Laughlin quasielectron states. This is due to the\nfact that, until recently, previous attempts at introducing quasielectrons invariably necessitated using antiholomorphic coordinates z \u22c6 (in some form) and then projecting to the lowest Landau level (LLL); this procedure\ncan be done in several ways, leading to different polynomial wavefunctions. For the non-Abelian states, quasielectron wavefunctions are not known. Recently, several\nauthors [4] have succeeded in expressing the Jain model\nquasielectron wavefunctions for the Laughlin hierarchy\nsequence as CFT correlators. However, several Abelian\nquasielectron models exist (due to Laughlin, Jain, Girvin,\nand others), and the physical differences between them\nare not fully understood.\n\ncan no longer vanish when k + 1 particles come together. We find two kinds of quasielectrons: an Abelian\n1-quasielectron wavefunction of the RR Zk sequence vanishes when 2k + 1 particles come together and when two\nclusters, each of k + 1 particles are formed at different\npositions. A non-Abelian 1-quasielectron wavefunction\nvanishes when k + 2 particles come together and when\ntwo clusters, each of k+1 particles are formed at different\npositions. For k = 1 (Laughlin states), the two clustering\nconditions are equivalent; our 1-quasielectron states turn\nout to be identical to Jain's. The clustering conditions\nthey satisfy explain the numerically observed energetic\nsuperiority of Jain's quasielectron over Laughlin's. Our\nmany-quasielectron states differ from Jain's. A hierarchy\nscheme based on the present quasielectrons gives rise to\na non-Abelian (CFT non-unitary) state for the \u03bd = 32\nbosonic (\u03bd = 25 fermionic) Gaffnian state [5] (identical\nto the (k, r) = (2, 3) Jack polynomial [6]). While Read\nhas recently given general arguments [7] against the idea\nthat FQH states described by a non-unitary CFT could\nbe gapped, we do not have a microscopic understanding\nof the failure of these states, such as an identification of\ntheir conjectured [7] gapless bulk excitation or failure to\nproperly screen in the non-Abelian sector. Even if they\ndo describe critical points and not phases of matter, we\nconsider it fruitful to investigate their properties further.\n\nIn this paper we provide an explicit construction of\nLLL quasielectron model wavefunctions for the Zk RR\nsequence. The RR Zk FQH ground-states are uniquely\ndefined as the smallest degree polynomials that vanish\nwhen k + 1 particles cluster together. Our purpose is\nto find similar physical clustering conditions (Hamiltonians) that uniquely define the 1-quasielectron state. Since\nquasielectrons involve the removal of flux, and hence the\nlowering of the total degree of the polynomial wavefunction, a 1-quasielectron wavefunction of the RR states\n\nWe represent a partition \u03bb with length l\u03bb \u2264 N\nas a (bosonic) occupation-number configuration n(\u03bb) =\n{nm (\u03bb), m = 0, 1, 2, . . .} of each of the LLL orbitals\n\u03c6m (z) = (2\u03c0m!2m )\u22121/2 z m exp(\u2212|z|2 /4) with angular\nmomentum Lz = m~ (see Fig[1]), where, for m > 0,\nnm (\u03bb) is the multiplicity of m in \u03bb. It is useful to identify\nthe \"dominance rule\" [8] (a partial ordering of partitions\n\u03bb > \u03bc) with the \"squeezing rule\"[9] that connects configurations n(\u03bb) \u2192 n(\u03bc): \"squeezing\" is a two-particle\noperation that moves a particle from orbital m1 to m\u20321\n\n\f2\nand another from m2 to m\u20322 , where m1 < m\u20321 \u2264 m\u20322 < m2 ,\nand m1 +m2 = m\u20321 +m\u20322 ; \u03bb > \u03bc if n(\u03bc) can be derived from\nn(\u03bb) by a sequence of \"squeezings\" (see Fig.1). An interacting LLL polynomial P\u03bb indexed by a root partition \u03bb\n[10, 11] is defined as exhibiting a dominance property if it\ncan be expanded in occupation-number non-interacting\nstates (monomials) of orbital occupations n(\u03bc) obtained\nby squeezing on the root occupation n(\u03bb):\nX\nP\u03bb = m\u03bb +\nv\u03bb\u03bc m\u03bc .\n(1)\n\nSqueezing Rule\n\n\u03bc<\u03bb\n\nThe v\u03bb\u03bc are rational number coefficients. Partitions \u03bb\ncan be classified by \u03bb1 , their largest part. When any P\u03bb\nis expanded in monomials m\u03bc , no orbital with m > \u03bb1\nis occupied. P\u03bb can be interpreted as states on a sphere\nsurrounding a monopole with charge N\u03a6 = \u03bb1 [12]. Uniform (ground) states on the sphere satisfy the conditions\nL+ \u03c8 = 0 (highest weight, HW) and L\u2212 \u03c8 = 0 (lowest\n\u2212\nweight, LW)Pwhere L+ = EP\n= N\u03a6 Z \u2212 E2 ,\n0 , and L\nn\nwhere Z \u2261 i zi , and En = i zi \u2202/\u2202zi . In a previous\npaper [6], we proved, by using the HW and LW conditions that the Jack polynomials (Jacks) of root occupation n(\u03bb0 (k, 2)) = [k0k0k...k0k] and Jack parameter\n\u03b1k,r = \u2212(k + 1)/(r \u2212 1) are the groundstate wavefunctions of the RR Zk sequence. The RR quasihole wavefunctions are also Jacks of root occupation numbers satisfying a (k, 2) [10] of a more general (k, r) Pauli principle\nwhich allows no more than k particles in r consecutive angular momentum orbitals. For the Jacks, the coefficients\nv\u03bb\u03bc are explicitly known by recursion [8]. In our construction, we require the squeezing rule be satisfied also for\nthe quasi-electron states. Our root occupation number\nis reminiscent of the thin-torus description [13]; however,\nwe generate the full interacting polynomial wavefunction\nand not just the non-interacting Tao-Thouless state.\nQuasielectron states satisfy only the HW condition\nL+ \u03c8 = 0 and should represent a small local perturbation of the otherwise featureless ground state density. We\nnow present the root occupation n(\u03bb) and a set of clustering conditions which uniquely define the quasielectron\nwavefunctions. We start with the Abelian 1-quasielectron\n\u2212(k+1)\n(z1 , ...zN ) (RR groundadded to the \u03bd = k2 Jacks J\u03bb0\nk,2\n\nstates) of root occupation n(\u03bb0k,2 ) = [k0k0k0k...k0k]. By\nanalogy with the Abelian quasihole, this should be a\nstate of total angular momentum L = N/2. We add 3\nfluxes to the groundstate and obtain the occupation number: n = [000k0k0k...k0k]. The Abelian 1\u2212quasielectron\nstate is obtained by adding 2 * k particles in the zero'th\norbital (North Pole): n(\u03bb0k,1 qp ) = [2 * k00k0k0k...k0k].\nSimple counting gives us N\u03a6 = k2 (N \u2212 k) \u2212 1, the correct flux for an N particle \u03bd = k2 Read-Rezayi state with\nan Abelian 1\u2212quasielectron. Away from the north pole,\nthe quasielectron root occupation relaxes to the bulk sequence [k0k...k0k].\nThe root occupation and the HW condition do\n\nFIG. 1: Landau problem on a disk. Orbital occupation to\nmonomial basis conversion and squeezing rule examples\n\nnot define the 1-quasielectron polynomial wavefunction\nuniquely. We now search for a way to uniquely define\nthe polynomial. In a previous paper [14] we showed\nthat the HW condition on the Jacks gives an infinite\nset of Jacks at \u03b1 = \u2212(k + 1) of occupation numbers\nn(\u03bb0k,2,s )=[n0 0s+1 k0k0k0k...] with n0 = (k +1)(s+1)\u22121,\nand s \u2265 0 a positive integer. For s = 0 these are the RR\nFQH groundstates. For s \u2265 1, we have n0 > k and hence\nthese configurations contain an excess of charge at the\nnorth pole, and heal in the bulk to the RR ground-state\nconfigurations. However, as the Abelian s-quasielectron\nstate in the Zk sequence should have N\u03a6 = k2 (N \u2212 k) \u2212 s,\nthe orbital occupation n(\u03bb0k,2,s ) contains too much charge\nat the north pole. To obtain the correct N\u03a6 , we must\n\"subtract\" s particles from the zero orbital of the occupation sequence n(\u03bb0k,2,s )=[n0 0s+1 k0k0k0k...] of the Jacks\ngiven in [14], to obtain the root occupation configuration\nn(\u03bb0k,s qp ) = [k * (s + 1)0s+1 k0k0k...k0k]. At the explicit,\nfirst quantized wavefunction level, this \"subtraction\" can\nbe done by symmetrization and padding of the Jack poly\u03b1\nnomial J\u03bb0k,r [15], but a simpler expression will be prek,2,s\n\nsented shortly. Defined in this way, the s-quasielectron\n\u03b1\nstate shares a clustering property with J\u03bb0k,2 that we obk,2,s\n\ntained in [14]: it vanishes when s+1 clusters of k+1 sameposition particles are formed. Being HW states dominated by n(\u03bb0k,s qp ), they also vanish when k * (s + 1) + 1\nparticles come together at the same point as the s + 2's\npower of the difference between coordinates [14]. The\nangular momentum of the Abelian s-quasielectron configurations above is l(\u03bb0k,s qp ) = Lz (\u03bb0k,s qp ) = 2s N . The\nabove root configurations define the maximum angular\nmomentum Abelian s\u2212quasielectron states (bunched up\nat the North Pole) of the Laughlin, Read-Moore and\nRead-Rezayi sequence. Hence, our HW Abelian (s =)\n1-quasielectron state is uniquely defined as the smallest\n\n\f3\ndegree polynomial satisfying the clustering conditions:\nP (z1 ...z1 , z2 ...z2 , z2k+3 , z2k+4 , ..., zN ) = 0\n| {z } | {z }\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\nP (z1 ...z1 , z2k+1 , z2k+2 , ..., zN ) \u223c\n| {z }\n2k\n\nQN\n\ni=2k+1 (z1\n\n\u2212 zi )3 (2)\n\nFor N\u03a6 = k2 (N \u2212 k) \u2212 1, the counting developed in\n[14] gives exactly N + 1 linearly independent polynomials satisfying Eq.(2). They correspond to the different lz 's of the l = N2 multiplet of states. The HW\nstate (l, lz ) = ( N2 , N2 ) satisfies a more stringent clustering\ncondition than Eq.(2): P (z1 , ...z1 , z2k+1 , z2k+2 , ..., zN ) =\n| {z }\n2k\nQN\n0\n3 \u2212(k+1)\n(z\n,\n(z\n\u2212\nz\n)\nJ\n2k+1 ..., zN ) where n(\u03bb (k, 2)) =\ni\ni=2 1\n\u03bb0 (k,2)\n\u2212(k+1)\nJ\u03bb0 (k,2) (z2k+1 , ..., zN )\n\nis the RR Zk\n[k0k0k...k0k] and\nground-state for N \u2212 k particles. An alternate definition which also uniquely fixes the HW 1-quasielectron\nstate is requiring that it satisfies HW, dominance, and\nthe first clustering condition in Eq.(2). The second clustering condition Eq(2) is then automatically obeyed.\nWe now obtain explicit first quantized expressions of\nour states. For the Laughlin, (k, r) = (1, 2), \u03bd = 1/2,\nstate we find that the 1\u2212quasielectron HW wavefunction\nP\u03bb0 (1,1) involves one symmetrization over a Jack found\nin [14]:\nP\u03bb01,1 qp (z1 , ..., zN ) = SymJ\u03bb\u22122\n(z1 , z1 , z2 , z3 , ...zN ) (3)\n0\n1,2,2\n\nModel HW wavefunctions for the s-qp state of maximum\nangular momentum l = s N2 are obtained by further symmetrization over the Jacks of [14]: P\u03bb1,s qp (z1 , ..., zN ) =\nSymJ\u03bb\u22122\n(z1 , z1 , z2 , z2 , ..., zs , zs , zs+1 , zs+2 , ..., zN ).\n0\n1,2,s+1\n\nFor k > 1, similar expressions can be obtained [15]. However, we found that our wavefunctions can be written in\ncompact form using an operator first introduced by Jain\n[16]:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u22021\n\u22022 ... \u2202N\n\uf8ec 1\n1 ... 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec z1\nz\n... zN \uf8f7\n2\nO(\u22021 , ..., \u2202N , z1 , ..., zN ) = Det \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec ..\n..\n.. \uf8f7\n\uf8ed .\n.\n. \uf8f8\nN \u22122\nN \u22122\nN \u22122\nz1\nz2\n... zN\nwhere Det denotes the determinant.

The lz = \u2212N/2...N/2 multiplet can\nbe obtained by successively applying the L\u2212 operator on\nP\u03bb0k,1 qp . These states also satisfy the clustering conditions in Eq.(2). The density profiles for the Read-Moore\n\u03bd = 1 and the Read-Rezayi \u03bd = 23 quasielectron are plotted in Fig[2]. For k = 1 Laughlin states, by Eq.(4) our\nquasielectron wavefunctions can be seen to be identical\nto Jain's [16]. Our definition of the quasielectron through\nthe clustering conditions Eq.(2) provides a physical explanation for the numerical finding [17] that Jain's quasielectron has a lower energy than Laughlin's [18]. We\nfound that Laughlin's original quasielectron wavefunction [18] satisfies the second of the clustering conditions\nin Eq.(2) but not the first one. We have checked that\nJain's quasielectron has a lower energy than Laughlin's\ndue to the fact that it satisfies one extra clustering condition.\nSo far we have focused on the bosonic (m = 0) Zk\nFQH states.

The above construction of the\nquasielectron trivially generalizes to the entire (k, r) Jack\nsequence of FQH states introduced in [6].\nWe now construct the non-Abelian quasielectron states\nfor the RR Zk sequence. A non-Abelian fractionalized quasielectron will always be accompanied by a non-\n\n\f4\nAbelian fractionalized quasihole, and will be composed\nof an electron bound to a fractionalized quasihole. As\nthe Abelian quasihole has angular momentum l = N2 ,\neach fractionalized non-Abelian quasihole (and fractionN\n. The basic neutral excialized quasiparticle) has l = 2k\ntation of the system is a fractionalized 1\u2212quasielectron\n1\u2212quasihole state at the same flux as the FQH RR\nground state N\u03a6 = k2 (N \u2212 k). As a fractionalized\nquasielectron and quasihole are distinguishable particles,\nangular L\nmomentum addition gives multiplets of states\nN\nN N\nN\nN\nl \u2261 2k\n2k = k , k \u2212 1, k \u2212 2, ..., 2, 1, 0 (the l = 1\nstate will be missing). The HW l = N\nk state corresponds\nto completely separating the fractionalized quasielectron\nat the North Pole from the fractionalized quasihole at\nthe South Pole. It is uniquely defined by the dominated\npolynomial of root occupation number n(\u03bb0k,1 qp - 1 qh ) =\n[k + 10k \u2212 11k \u2212 11k \u2212 1...1k \u2212 1], satisfying the clustering\nconditions:\nP (z1 , ..., z1 , z2 , ..., z2 , z2k+3 , z2k+4 , ..., N ) = 0;\n| {z } | {z }\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\nP (z1 , ..., z1 , zk+3 , zk+4 , ..., zN ) = 0\n| {z }\n\n(5)\n\nk+2\n\nThe HW (lz = l) states of the l = N\nk \u22121, ..., 2, 0 multiplets\ncan be uniquely defined by imposing HW, along with first\nclustering condtition in Eq.(5) on dominated polynomials\nwith root occupation numbers:\nN\nk ; [k\nN\nl = k \u2212 1;\n= N\nk \u2212 2;\n\nl=\n\nl\n\n+ 10k \u2212 11k \u2212 11...1k \u2212 11k \u2212 1];\n[k + 10k \u2212 11k \u2212 11...1k \u2212 10k];\n\n[k + 10k \u2212 11k \u2212 11...1k \u2212 10k0k];\nl = 2; [k + 10k \u2212 10k0k...k0k0k];\nl = 0; [k0k0k0k...k0k0k];\n\n(6)\n\nThe second clustering condition in Eq.(5) is then automatically obeyed. Successive application of the L\u2212 operator yields the lz = l, ..., \u2212l wavefunctions, which also\nobey the clustering conditions in Eq.(5). We can in fact\nprove that our states satisfy a stronger clustering condition than in Eq.(5):\nP (z1 ...z1 , z2 ...z2 , z2k+2 , z2k+3 , ..., zN ) \u223c (z1 \u2212 z2 )2k+1\n| {z } | {z }\nk+1\n\nk\n\n\u00d7\n\nQN\n\ni=2k+2 (z2\n\n\u2212 zi )2 (z1 \u2212 zi )2\n\nFIG. 3: Exact HW non-Abelian quasielectron-quasihole density profiles,in units of kN/4\u03c0(N \u2212 k)l2 , for the Moore-Read\n(k = 2) and Read-Rezayi (k = 3) N -particle states on the\nsphere. The fractionalized quasielectron is at the north pole\nwhile the fractionalized quasihole is at the south pole. In the\nthermodynamic limit, the region in the middle of the sphere\nat density 1 will dominate the density function.\n\n(7)\n\nThe root occupation numbers for the Moore-Read\nground-state and it's quasiparticle excitations are shown\nin Fig.[4].\nJust as in the Abelian case, there are several ways\nto define the non-Abelian 1\u2212quasielectron 1\u2212quasihole\nstates, which lead to the same result. Requiring HW,\ndominance with respect to the root occupation numbers Eq.(6) and the first of the clustering conditions in\nEq.(5) uniquely defines the states. The second clustering\n\ncondition in Eq.(5) is then automatically satisfied. Alternatively, Eq.(7) and the second clustering in Eq.(5)\nalso uniquely define the Hilbert space of 1\u2212quasielectron\n1\u2212quasihole states, although in this case further angu~ eigenlar momentum projection is needed to obtain L\nstates. For k = 1, z2 is not different from z3 , ..., zN , and\nthe non-Abelian clustering conditions become identical\nto the Abelian ones (the Laughlin states support only\nAbelian excitations). We can \"energetically\" justify our\nquasielectron-quasihole wavefunctions. As they cannot\nvanish when k + 1 particles come together (this condition\ndefines the RR Zk ground-state and pure quasiholes), the\nlowest \"energy\" configuration that one can create is to\nrequire the wavefunction vanish in a k+2 particle cluster.\nWe now focus on the s-quasielectron states, (s > 1)\nand first treat the k = 1, \u03bd = 21 Laughlin state. We have\npreviously described the root occupation for the HW\ns\u2212quasielectron states at maximum angular momentum\nl = s N2 , as well as their explicit wavefunction in terms\nof symmetrization over a series of Jack polynomials defined in [14]. We now want to find the root occupation\nand clustering conditions for the minimum angular momentum s\u2212quasielectron states. Consistency arguments\nfavor maintaining that the state vanishes when 3 particles come together (second clustering condition for 1quasiparticle in Eq.(2)). The generalization of the first\nclustering condition in Eq.(2) is that the state vanishes\nwhen we form s + 1 distinct clusters of 2\u2212particles:\nP (z1 , z1 , z2 , z2 , ..., zs+1 , zs+1 , z2s+3 , z2s+4 , ..., zN ) = 0;\nQN\nP (z1 , z1 , z3 , z4 , ..., zN ) \u223c i=2 (z1 \u2212 zi )3\n(8)\nThis is the most consistent set of clustering conditions\ngeneralizing the Eq.(2).

We now focus on the differences between the\ntwo states. As the usual expression for the Jain \u03bd = 2/3\n~ = 0 state,\nstate on the plane [4] does not lead to an L\nwe first construct it on the sphere, and then stereographically project to the plane. We write below the root occupations of the Gaffnian and Jain's \u03bd = 2/3 states (the\nJain state root configuration will be explained in a future\nmanuscript [19]):\n\n2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2...\n\n! e/2\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1...\n\n!e\n\n0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0...\n\nFIG. 4: Root occupation numbers for the Highest Weight\nbosonic Moore-Read ground state, Abelian (charge \u2212e) quasihole, fractionalized quasihole (charge \u2212e/2), Abelian (charge\ne) quasielectron, and fractionalized (charge e/2) quasielectron. The fractionalized quasielectron is a composite particle\ncontaining one electron, denoted here by two yellow star symbols, and a fractionalized quasihole (one blue circle)\n\nfrom Jain's. The HW state is the minimum degree polynomial in N variables satisfying Eq.(8). We find it exhibits a dominance property with the root configuration:\nn(\u03bb01,s qp ) = [2002002...2002\n|\n{z\n} 001010101...0101]\n\n(9)\n\ns\n\nJain's s\u2212quasielectron state is a polynomial that also\nexhibits the dominance property in Eq.(1) with the root\noccupation 2010 11011011...0110110\n|\n{z\n} 1010101...010101, as\ns\u22122\n\nwill be shown in a future publication [19]. It satisfies the\nclustering conditions [19]:\n\nP (z1 , z1 , z2 , z2 , ..., zs+1 , zs+1 , z2s+3 , z2s+4 , ..., zN ) = 0;\nQN\n(10)\nP (z1 , z1 , z3 , z4 , ..., zN ) \u223c i=2 (z1 \u2212 zi )2\nbut, unlike our s\u2212 quasielectron state, is not uniquely\ndefined by them. The exponent of the s > 1 quasielectron second clustering condition in the Jain state Eq.(10)\nis different from the exponent in the s = 1 quasielectron\nJain state Eq.(2). The exponent in our clustering condition Eq.(8) remains the same for both the s = 1 and\ns > 1 quasielectron states. For small number of electrons\nwith Coulomb interaction, Jain's and our Jack quasielectron states have the same energy for s = 1 (by virtue of\nbeing identical), and similar energies for s > 1 (Monte\nCarlo energy for our Jack 2 quasiparticle bosonic state\n2\n2\nis 4.71 \u00b1 0.03( el ) whereas Jain's is 4.68 \u00b1 0.01( el ) for\nN = 6 electrons).\nA hierarchical scheme of adding our Jack quasielectrons on top of the \u03bd = 1/2 Laughlin state takes one\nto a non-Abelian, non-unitary \u03bd = 2/3 bosonic state.\nBy adding s = N/2 Jack quasielectrons in the Laughlin state one obtains the HW state of root occupation\n[2002002...2002]. We find this is the (k, r) = (2, 3) Jack\npolynomial state [6], initially discovered in [20] and called\nthe Gaffnian.

This explains their close energy and large common\noverlap observed in [20]. From the root configuration\nabove, we can see that Jain state is the 2\u2212quasielectron2\u2212 quasihole excitation of the Gaffnian Hamiltonian.\nFinally, we conjecture that the non-Abelian squasielectron s-quasihole RR Hilbert space is spanned\nby polynomials with N\u03c6 = k2 (N \u2212 k) satisfying the\nclustering conditions: 1. P (z1 ...z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 ...) = 0;\n| {z }\nk+2\nQN\n2k+1\n2.

For the Laughlin state, the Jack\n1\u2212quasielectron excitations are identical to Jain's but\nthey differ for s > 1 quasielectrons. In particular, a hierarchy scheme based on adding Jack quasielectrons in the\nLaughlin state leads one to a non-Abelian non-unitary\n\u03bd = 23 (or \u03bd = 52 fermionic) state, the Gaffnian [20] or\nthe Jack (2, 3) state [6].\nWe wish to thank N.
