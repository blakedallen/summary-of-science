Three dimensional simulations of \u03bd-radiationhydrodynamics, which are currently formidable, and better determinations of the nuclear\nequation of state of dense matter and the neutrino-related reaction rates are mandatory. One\nhas to advance step by step by developing numerical methods and examining microphysics\nand its influence in various stages of supernovae.\nEven with the extensive studies in recent years with currently available computing\nresources, the numerical results have not made clear the explosion mechanism. On one\nhand, recent multi-dimensional supernova simulations with approximate neutrino-transport\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nschemes have revealed the importance of asymmetry such as rotation, convection, magnetic\nfields and/or hydrodynamical instability (Blondin et al. 2003; Buras et al. 2003; Kotake\net al. 2003; Fryer & Warren 2004; Kotake et al. 2004; Walder et al. 2004). On the other\nhand, spherically symmetric supernova simulations of late have removed the uncertainty of\nneutrino-transport and clarified the role of neutrinos in core-collapse and shock propagation\n(Rampp & Janka 2000; Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2001; Mezzacappa et al. 2001; Rampp & Janka\n2002; Thompson et al. 2003). In this study, we focus on spherically symmetric simulations\nwhich are advantageous to examine the role of microphysics without ambiguity of neutrinotransport.\nAlmost all authors have reported that neither prompt explosion nor delayed explosion\noccurs under the spherical symmetry. This conclusion is commonly reached by simulations\nwith Newtonian (Rampp 2000; Rampp & Janka 2000; Mezzacappa et al. 2001; Thompson\net al. 2003), approximately relativistic (Rampp & Janka 2002) and fully general relativistic\n(Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2001) gravity, together with standard microphysics, i.e. the equation of\nstate (EOS) by Lattimer & Swesty (1991) and the weak reaction rates by Bruenn (1985).\nThe influence of nuclear physics inputs has been further assessed by employing the extended\nneutrino reactions (Thompson et al. 2003, see also section 3.2) and more up-to-date electron capture rates on nuclei (Hix et al. 2003). The dependence on the progenitor models\n(Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2002; Thompson et al. 2003; Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2004; Janka et al. 2004)\nand the sets of physical EOS (Janka et al. 2004) has been studied very recently. These\nsimulations so far have shown that the collapse of iron cores leads to the stalled shock after\nbounce without successful explosion.\nIn the current study, we explore the influence of EOS in the time period that has\nnot been studied very well in the previous studies. Most of recent numerical simulations\nhave been performed until about 300 milliseconds after bounce. This is due to the severe\nlimitation on time steps by the Courant condition for explicit time-differencing schemes. A\ntypical time step in the explicit method is about 10\u22126 seconds after the formation of dense\ncompact objects. However, in the implicit method as we employ in this study, the time step\nis not restricted by the Courant condition. This is advantageous for a long-term evolution.\nIn the studies by Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. (2002, 2004), who also adopted the implicit method, the\npostbounce evolution has been followed up to about 1 second for a small number of models\nwith Lattimer and Swesty EOS. Historically, the idea of the delayed explosion was proposed\nby Wilson's simulations that followed more than several hundred milliseconds after bounce.\nIn some cases, the revival of shock wave occurred even beyond 0.5 seconds (for example,\nBethe and Wilson 1985). It is still interesting to explore this late phase in the light of\npossible influence of microphysics.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe progress of the supernova EOS put an additional motivation to the study of this\nlate postbounce phase. Only recently the sets of physical EOS, which cover a wide range of\ndensity, composition and temperature in a usable and complete form, have become available\nfor simulations. A table of EOS was made for the first time by Hillebrandt & Wolff (1985)\nwithin the Skyrme Hartree-Fock approach and applied to some simulations (Hillebrandt et\nal. 1984; Suzuki 1990, 1993, 1994; Sumiyoshi et al. 1995c; Janka et al. 2004). Another set\nof EOS has been provided as a numerical routine by Lattimer & Swesty (1991) utilizing the\ncompressible liquid-drop model. This EOS has been used these years as a standard.\nRecently, a new complete set of EOS for supernova simulations has become available\n(Shen et al. 1998a,b). The relativistic mean field (RMF) theory with a local density approximation was applied to the derivation of the table of supernova EOS. This EOS is different\nin two important aspects from previous EOSs. One thing is that the Shen's EOS is based\non the relativistic nuclear many-body framework whereas the previous ones are based on the\nnon-relativistic frameworks. The relativistic treatment is known to affect the behavior of\nEOS at high densities (i.e. stiffness) (Brockmann & Machleidt 1990) and the size of nuclear\nsymmetry energy (Sumiyoshi et al. 1995b). The other thing is that the Shen's EOS is based\non the experimental data of unstable nuclei, which have become available recently. The data\nof neutron-rich nuclei, which are close to the astrophysical environment, were used to constrain the nuclear interaction. The resulting properties of isovector interaction are generally\ndifferent from the non-relativistic counterpart and the size of symmetry energy is different.\nThe significant differences in stiffness and compositions during collapse and bounce have\nbeen shown between Shen's EOS and Lattimer-Swesty EOS by hydrodynamical calculations\n(Sumiyoshi et al. 2004). Therefore, it would be exciting to explore the supernova dynamics\nwith the new set of EOS. Such an attempt has been made recently by Janka et al. (2004)\nand no explosion has been reported up to 300 milliseconds after bounce.\nOur aim of the current study is, therefore, the comparison of the postbounce evolutions\nbeyond 300 milliseconds for the first time. We perform the core-collapse simulations adopting\nthe two sets of EOS, that is, Shen's EOS (SH-EOS) and Lattimer-Swesty EOS (LS-EOS).\nWe follow the evolutions of supernova core for a long period. We explore the fate of the\nstalled shock up to 1 second after bounce. In this time period, one can also see the birth\nof protoneutron star as a continuous evolution from the collapsing phase together with the\nlong-term evolution of neutrino emissions. Although the supernova core does not display\nsuccessful explosion, as we will see, the current simulations may provide some aspects of\ncentral core leading to the formation of protoneutron star or black hole. This information\nis also helpful to envisage the properties of supernova neutrinos in the first second since\nthe simulations of protoneutron star cooling done so far usually starts from several hundred\nmilliseconds after bounce for some given profiles. As a whole, we aim to clarify how the EOS\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ninfluences the dynamics of shock wave, evolution of central core and supernova neutrinos.\n\n2.\n\nNumerical Methods\n\nA new numerical code of general relativistic, \u03bd-radiation-hydrodynamics under the\nspherical symmetry has been developed (Yamada 1997; Yamada et al. 1999) for supernova\nsimulations. The code solves a set of equations of hydrodynamics and neutrino-transfer simultaneously in the implicit way, which enables us to have substantially longer time steps\nthan explicit methods. This is advantageous for the study of long-term behaviors after core\nbounce. The implicit method has been also adopted by Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. (2004) in their\ngeneral relativistic \u03bd-radiation-hydrodynamics code. They have taken, however, an operator\nsplitting method so that hydrodynamics and neutrino-transfer could be treated separately.\n\n2.1.\n\nHydrodynamics\n\nThe equations of lagrangian hydrodynamics in general relativity are solved by a implicit, finite differencing. The numerical method is based on the approximate linearized\nRiemann solver (Roe-type scheme) that captures shock waves without introducing artificial viscosities. Assuming the spherical symmetry, the metric of Misner & Sharp (1964) is\nadopted to formulate hydrodynamics and neutrino-transport equations. A set of equations\nfor the conservation of baryon number, lepton number and energy-momentum are solved together with the metric equations and the entropy equation. Details of the numerical method\nof hydrodynamics can be found in (Yamada 1997), where standard numerical tests of the\nhydrodynamics code have been also reported.\n\n2.2.\n\nNeutrino-transport\n\nThe Boltzmann equation for neutrinos in general relativity is solved by a finite difference\nscheme (SN method) implicitly together with above-mentioned lagrangian hydrodynamics.\nThe neutrino distribution function, f\u03bd (t, m, \u03bc, \u03b5\u03bd ), as a function of time t, lagrangian mass\ncoordinate m, neutrino propagation angle \u03bc and neutrino energy \u03b5\u03bd , is evolved. Finite differencing of the Boltzmann equation is mostly based on the scheme by Mezzacappa & Bruenn\n(1993a). However, the update of time step is done simultaneously with hydrodynamics.\nThe reactions of neutrinos are explicitly calculated in the collision terms of the Boltzmann\nequation with incident/outgoing neutrino angles and energies taken into account. Detailed\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ncomparisons with the Monte Carlo method have been made to validate the Boltzmann solver\nand to examine the angular resolution (Yamada et al. 1999).\n\n2.3.\n\n\u03bd-radiation-hydrodynamics\n\nThe whole set of finite-differenced equations described above are solved by the NewtonRaphson iterative method. The Jacobian matrix forms a block-tridiagonal matrix, in which\ndense block matrices arise from the collision terms of the transport equation. Since the\ninversion of this large matrix is most costly in the computing time, we utilize a parallel\nalgorithm of block cyclic reduction for the matrix solver (Sumiyoshi & Ebisuzaki 1998).\nIn the current simulations, we adopt non-uniform 255 spatial zones for lagrangian mass\ncoordinate. We discretize the neutrino distribution function with 6 angle zones and 14\nenergy zones for \u03bde , \u03bd\u0304e , \u03bd\u03bc/\u03c4 and \u03bd\u0304\u03bc/\u03c4 , respectively.\n\n2.4.\n\nRezoning\n\nThe description of long-term evolution of accretion in a lagrangian coordinate is a numerically tough problem. In order to keep enough resolution during the accretion phase,\nrezoning of accreting materials is done long before they accrete onto the surface of protoneutron star and become opaque to neutrinos. At the same time, dezoning of the hydrostatic\ninner part of protoneutron star is done to avoid the increase of grid points.\nWhen we have tried simulations without rezoning, neutrino luminosities oscillate largely\nin time due to intermittent accretion of coarse grid points and it sometimes leads to erroneous\ndynamics (even explosions). Therefore, we have checked that the resolution of grid points is\nenough by refining the initial grid points and rezoning during the simulations. Even then,\nthere are still slight oscillations in luminosities and average energies of neutrinos in the last\nstage of calculations. There are also transient kinks sometimes when the grid size in mass\ncoordinate changes during accretion as we will see in section 4.5. These slight modulations\nof neutrino quantities, however, do not affect the overall evolution of protoneutron stars with\naccretion once we have enough resolution.\n\n3.\n\nModel Descriptions\n\nAs an initial model, we adopt the profile of iron core of a 15M\u2299 progenitor from Woosley\n& Weaver (1995). This progenitor has been widely used in supernova simulations. The\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ncomputational grid points in mass coordinate are non-uniformly placed to cover the central\ncore, shock propagation region and accreting material with enough resolution.\n\n3.1.\n\nEquation of state\n\nThe new complete set of EOS for supernova simulations (SH-EOS) (Shen et al. 1998a,b)\nis derived by the relativistic mean field (RMF) theory with a local density approximation.\nThe RMF theory has been a successful framework to reproduce the saturation properties,\nmasses and radii of nuclei, and proton-nucleus scattering data (Serot & Walecka 1986). We\nstress that the RMF theory (Sugahara & Toki 1994) is based on the relativistic Br\u00fccknerHartree-Fock (RBHF) theory (Brockmann & Machleidt 1990), which is a microscopic and\nrelativistic many-body theory. The RBHF theory has been shown to be successful to reproduce the saturation of nuclear matter starting from the nucleon-nucleon interactions\ndetermined by scattering experiments. This is in good contrast with non-relativistic manybody frameworks which can account for the saturation only with the introduction of extra\nthree-body interactions.\nThe effective interactions in the RMF theory have been determined by least squares\nfittings to reproduce the experimental data of masses and radii of stable and unstable nuclei\n(Sugahara & Toki 1994). The determined parameters of interaction, TM1, have been applied\nto many studies of nuclear structures and experimental analyses (Sugahara et al. 1996;\nHirata et al. 1997). One of stringent tests on the isovector interaction is passed in excellent\nagreement of the theoretical prediction with the experimental data on neutron and proton\ndistributions in isotopes including neutron-rich ones with neutron-skins (Suzuki et al. 1995;\nOzawa et al. 2001). The RMF theory with the parameter set TM1 provides uniform nuclear\nmatter with the incompressibility of 281 MeV and the symmetry energy of 36.9 MeV. The\nmaximum mass of neutron star is 2.2 M\u2299 for the cold neutron star matter in the RMF with\nTM1 (Sumiyoshi et al. 1995a). The table of EOS covers a wide range of density, electron\nfraction and temperature for supernova simulations, and has been applied to numerical\nsimulations of r-process in neutrino-driven winds (Sumiyoshi et al. 2000), prompt supernova\nexplosions (Sumiyoshi et al. 2001), and other simulations (Sumiyoshi et al. 1995c; Rosswog\n& Davies 2003; Sumiyoshi et al. 2004; Janka et al. 2004).\nFor comparison, we also adopt the EOS by Lattimer & Swesty (1991). The LS-EOS\nis based on the compressible liquid drop model for nuclei together with dripped nucleons.\nThe bulk energy of nuclear matter is expressed in terms of density, proton fraction and\ntemperature. The values of nuclear parameters are chosen according to nuclear mass formulae\nand other theoretical studies with the Skyrme interaction. Among various parameters, the\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nsymmetry energy is set to be 29.3 MeV, which is smaller than the value in the relativistic\nEOS. As for the incompressibility, we use 180 MeV, which has been used frequently for\nrecent supernova simulations. In this case, the maximum mass of neutron star is estimated\nto be 1.8 M\u2299 . This choice enables us to make comparisons with previous works, though 180\nMeV is smaller than the standard value as will be discussed below. The sensitivity to the\nincompressibility of LS-EOS has been studied by Thompson et al. (2003) using the choices\nof 180, 220 and 375 MeV. The numerical results of core-collapse and bounce with different\nincompressibilities turn out to be similar up to 200 milliseconds after bounce. The differences\nin luminosities and average energies of emergent neutrinos are within 10 % and do not affect\nsignificantly the post-bounce dynamics on the time scale of 100 ms. The influence of different\nincompressibilities in LS-EOS on the time scale of 1 sec remains to be seen as an extension\nof the current study. For densities below 107 g/cm3 , the subroutine of Lattimer-Swesty\nEOS runs into numerical troubles, therefore, we adopt Shen's EOS in this density regime\ninstead. This is mainly for numerical convenience. In principle, it is preferable to adopt the\nEOS, which contains electrons and positrons at arbitrary degeneracy and relativity, photons,\nnucleons and an ensemble of nuclei as non-relativistic ideal gases (see for example, Timmes\n& Arnett (1999); Thompson et al. (2003)). One also has to take into account non-NSE\nabundances determined from the preceding quasi-static evolutions. Note that we are chiefly\nconcerned with the effect of EOS at high densities, and this pragmatic treatment does not\nhave any significant influence on the shock dynamics.\nWe comment here on the nuclear parameters of EOS and its consequences for the astrophysical applications considered here. The value of incompressibility of nuclear matter has\nbeen considered to be within 200\u2013300 MeV from experimental data and theoretical analyses. The value recently obtained within the non-relativistic approaches (Colo & Van Giai\n2004) is 220\u2013240 MeV. The corresponding value extracted within the relativistic approaches\nis known to be higher than non-relativistic counterpart and is 250\u2013270 MeV (Vretenar et al.\n2003; Colo & Van Giai 2004). It is also known that the determination of incompressibility\nis closely related with the size of the symmetry energy and its density dependence. The\nincompressibility of EOS in the RMF with TM1 is slightly higher than those standard values and the SH-EOS is relatively stiff. The neutron stars with SH-EOS are, therefore, less\ncompact with lower central densities and have higher maximum masses than those obtained\nby LS-EOS with the incompressibility of 180 MeV. The adiabatic index of SH-EOS at the\nbounce of supernova core is larger than that of LS-EOS (Sumiyoshi et al. 2004).\nThe value of symmetry energy at the nuclear matter density is known to be around 30\nMeV by nuclear mass formulae (M\u00f6ller et al. 1995). The recent derivation of the symmetry\nenergy in a relativistic approach gives higher values of 32\u201336 MeV together with the above\nmentioned higher incompressibility (Dieperink et al. 2003; Vretenar et al. 2003). The sym-\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nmetry energy in the RMF with TM1 is still a bit larger compared with the standard values.\nWe note that the symmetry energy in the RMF is determined by the fitting of masses and\nradii of various nuclei including neutron-rich ones. The large symmetry energy in SH-EOS\nleads to large proton fractions in cold neutron stars, which may lead to a possible rapid\ncooling by the direct URCA process, as well as the stiffness of neutron matter (Sumiyoshi\net al. 1995a). The difference between neutron and proton chemical potentials is large and\nleads to different compositions of free protons and nuclei (Sumiyoshi et al. 2004). The consequences of these differences in incompressibility and symmetry energy will be discussed in\nthe comparison of numerical simulations in section 4.\n\n3.2.\n\nWeak reaction rates\n\nThe weak interaction rates regarding neutrinos are evaluated by following the standard formulation by Bruenn (1985). For the collision term in the Boltzmann equation, the\nscattering kernels are explicitly calculated in terms of angles and energies of incoming and\noutgoing neutrinos (Mezzacappa & Bruenn 1993b). In addition to the Bruenn's standard\nneutrino processes, the plasmon process (Braaten and Segel 1993) and the nucleon-nucleon\nbremsstralung process (Friman & Maxwell 1979; Maxwell 1987) are included in the collision\nterm. The latter reaction has been shown to be an important process to determine the\nsupernova neutrinos from the protoneutron star cooling (Suzuki 1993; Burrows et al. 2000)\nas a source of \u03bd\u03bc/\u03c4 . The conventional standard weak reaction rates are used for the current\nsimulations to single out the effect of EOS and to compare with previous simulations. Recent\nprogress of neutrino opacities in nuclear matter (Burrows et al. 2005) and electron capture\nrates on nuclei (Langanke & Martinez-Pinedo 2003) will be examined along with the updates\nof EOS in future studies.\n\n4.\n\nComparison of results\n\nWe present the results of two numerical simulations performed with Shen's EOS and\nLattimer-Swesty EOS. They are denoted by SH and LS, respectively.\n\n4.1.\n\nShock propagation\n\nFig. 1 shows the radial trajectories of mass elements as a function of time after bounce\nin model SH. The trajectories are plotted for each 0.02M\u2299 in mass coordinate up to 1.0M\u2299\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nand for each 0.01M\u2299 for the rest of outer part. Thick lines denote the trajectories for\n0.5M\u2299 , 1.0M\u2299 and 1.5M\u2299 . One can see the shock wave is launched up to 150 kilometers and\nstalled there within 100 milliseconds. The shock wave recedes down to below 100 kilometers\nafterwards and the revival of shock wave or any sign of it is not found even after 300\nmilliseconds.\nInstead, the stationary accretion shock is formed at several tens of kilometers. As the\ncentral core gradually contracts, a protoneutron star is born at center. The material, which\nwas originally located in the outer core, accretes onto the surface of the protoneutron star.\nThe accretion rate is about 0.2M\u2299 /s on average and decreases from 0.25M\u2299 /s to 0.15M\u2299 /s\ngradually. This behavior is similar in model LS. At 1 sec after bounce, the baryon mass of\nprotoneutron star is 1.60M\u2299 for both cases.\nThe trajectories of shock wave in models SH and LS are compared in Fig. 2. The\npropagations of shock wave in two models are similar in the first 200 milliseconds (left\npanel). We note that slight fluctuations in the curves are due to numerical artifact in the\nprocedure to determine the shock position. Note that we have rather low resolutions in\nthe central part in order to have higher resolutions in the accreting material. Except for\nthe discrepancy due to the different numerical methods (e.g. approximate general relativity,\neulerian etc.), zoning and resolutions, the current simulations up to 200 milliseconds are\nconsistent with the results (middle panel of Figure 3) by Janka et al. (2004) having similar\nmaximum radii and timing of recession. The difference shows up from 200 milliseconds after\nbounce and becomes more apparent in the later phase (right panel). After 600 milliseconds,\nthe shock position in model LS is less than 20 kilometers and it is clearly different from that\nin model SH. This difference originates from the faster contraction of the protoneutron star\nin model LS. We discuss the evolution of protoneutron star later in section 4.4.\n\n4.2.\n\nCollapse phase\n\nThe initial propagation of shock wave is largely controlled by the properties of the\ninner core during the gravitational collapse. We have found noticeable differences in the\nbehavior of core-collapse in two models. However, they did not change the initial shock\nenergy drastically, which then leads to the similarity of the early phase of shock propagation\nwe have just seen above.\nFirst of all, it is remarkable that the compositions of dense matter during the collapse\nare different. In Fig. 3, the mass fraction is shown as a function of mass coordinate when\nthe central density reaches 1011 g/cm3 . The mass fraction of free proton in model SH is\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nsmaller than that in model LS by a factor of \u223c5. This is caused by the larger symmetry\nenergy in SH-EOS, where the proton chemical potential is lower than the neutron chemical\npotential as discussed in Sumiyoshi et al. (2004). The smaller free proton fraction reduces\nthe electron captures on free protons. Note that the electron capture on nuclei is suppressed\nin the current simulations due to the blocking above N=40 in Bruenn's prescription. This\nis in accordance with the numerical results by Bruenn (1989); Swesty et al. (1994) who\nstudied the influence of the free proton fraction and the symmetry energy. However, there\nis also a negative feedback in the deleptonization during collapse (Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. 2002).\nSmaller electron capture rates keep electron fraction high, which then leads to an increase of\nfree proton fraction and consequently to electron captures after all. The resultant electron\nfraction turns out to be not significantly different as we will see later.\nIt is also noticeable that the mass fraction of alpha particles differs substantially and\nthe abundance of nuclei is slightly reduced in model SH. This difference of alpha abundances\nin two models persists during the collapse and even in the post-bounce phase. The nuclear\nspecies appearing in the central core during collapse are shown in the nuclear chart (Fig.\n4). The nuclei in model SH are always less neutron-rich than those in model LS by more\nthan several neutrons. This is also due to the effect of the symmetry energy, which gives\nnuclei closer to the stability line in model SH. The mass number reaches up to \u223c80 and\n\u223c100 at the central density of 1011 g/cm3 (solid circle) and 1012 g/cm3 (open circle), respectively. In the current simulations, the electron capture on nuclei is suppressed beyond\nN=40 due to the simple prescription employed here and the difference of species do not give\nany difference. However, results may turn out different when more realistic electron capture\nrates are adopted (Hix et al. 2003). It would be interesting to see whether the difference\nfound in two EOSs leads to differences in central cores using recent electron capture rates\non nuclei (Langanke & Martinez-Pinedo 2003). Further studies are necessary to discuss the\nabundances of nuclei and the influence of more updated electron capture rates for mixture\nof nuclear species beyond the approximation of single-species in the current EOSs.\nThe profiles of lepton fractions at bounce are shown in Fig. 5. The central electron\nfraction in model SH is Ye =0.31, which is slightly higher than Ye =0.29 in model LS. The\ncentral lepton fractions including neutrinos for models SH and LS are rather close to each\nother, having YL =0.36 and 0.35, respectively. The difference of lepton fraction results in\na different size of the inner core. The larger lepton fraction in model SH leads to a larger\ninner core 0.61M\u2299 , whereas it is 0.55M\u2299 in model LS. Here, the inner core is defined by the\nregion inside the position of velocity discontinuity, which is the beginning of shock wave.\nFig. 6 shows the velocity profile at bounce. We define the bounce (tpb =0 ms) as the time\nwhen the central density reaches the maximum, which is similar to other definitions such as\nusing the peak entropy height. The central density reaches 3.4\u00d71014 g/cm3 and 4.4\u00d71014\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ng/cm3 in models SH and LS, respectively. The difference of stiffness in two EOSs leads to\na lower peak central density in model SH than that in model LS. Because of this difference,\nthe radial size of inner core at bounce is \u223c1 km larger for model SH than that for model LS.\nThe initial shock energy, which is roughly estimated by the gravitational binding energy\nof inner core at bounce, turns out to be not drastically different because of the increases\nboth in mass and radial size of the inner core in model SH. Clearer difference appears at\nlater stages where the protoneutron star is formed having a central density much higher than\nthe nuclear matter density. This is one of reasons why we are interested in the late phase of\nsupernova core, where the difference of EOS appears more clearly and its influence on the\nsupernova dynamics could be seen.\nWe remark here that the numerical results with LS-EOS at bounce are in good agreement\nwith previous simulations such as the reference models by Liebend\u00f6rfer et al. (2005). For\nexample, the profiles of model LS shown in Figs. 5 and 6 accord with the profiles of their\nmodel G15. The behavior after bounce is also qualitatively consistent with the reference\nmodels up to 250 milliseconds (see also section 4.4).\n\n4.3.\n\nPostbounce phase\n\nThe postbounce phase is interesting in many aspects, especially in clarifying the role of\nEOS in the neutrino heating mechanism and the protoneutron star formation. As we have\nseen in section 4.1, the stall of shock wave occurs in a similar manner in two models and\nthe difference appears in later stage. We discuss here the similarities and the differences in\nterms of the effect of EOS.\nThe evolution of shock wave after it stalls around 100 kilometers is controlled mainly by\nthe neutrino heating behind the shock wave. The neutrinos emitted from the neutrinosphere\nin the nascent protoneutron star contribute to the heating of material just behind the shock\nwave through absorption on nucleons. Whether the shock wave revives or not depends on\nthe total amount of heating, hence more specifically, on the neutrino spectrum, luminosity,\namount of targets (nucleons), mass of heating region and duration time.\nThe heating rates of material in supernova core in two models at tpb=150 ms are shown\nin Fig. 7 as a function of radius. The heating rate in model SH is smaller than that in model\nLS around 100 kilometers. The cooling rate (negative value in the heating rate) in model\nSH is also smaller than that in model LS. The smaller heating (cooling) rate in model SH\nis caused by lower neutrino luminosities and smaller free-proton fractions. Figs. 8 and 9\nshow the radial profiles of neutrino luminosities and mass fractions of dense matter around\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nthe heating region. The luminosities in model SH are lower than those in model LS for all\nneutrino flavors. The mass fraction of free protons, which are the primary target of neutrino\nheating, is slightly smaller in model SH around the heating region. These two combinations\nlower the heating rate in model SH. It is also interesting that other compositions (alpha and\nnuclei) appear different in this region.\nThe lower luminosities in model SH are related with the lower cooling rate. The temperature of protoneutron star in model SH is generally lower than that in model LS as shown\nin Fig. 10. The peak temperature, which is produced by the shock heating and the contraction of core, in model SH is lower than that in model LS. This difference exists also in the\nsurface region of the protoneutron star, where neutrinos are emitted via cooling processes.\nThe temperature at the neutrinosphere in model SH is lower and, as a result, the cooling\nrate is smaller. The difference of temperature becomes more evident as the protoneutron\nstar evolves as we will see in the next section.\n\n4.4.\n\nProtoneutron star\n\nThe thermal evolution of protoneutron star formed after bounce is shown in Fig. 11\nfor two models. Snapshots of temperature profile at tpb =20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500,\n600, 700, 800, 900 ms and 1 s are shown. The temperature increase is slower in model SH\nthan in model LS. The peak temperature at tpb=1 s is 39 and 53 MeV in models SH and\nLS, respectively. The temperature difference arises mainly from the stiffness of EOS. The\nprotoneutron star contracts more in model LS and has a higher central density than in model\nSH. At tpb =1 s, the central density in model SH is 4.1 \u00d7 1014 g/cm3 whereas that in model\nLS is 7.0 \u00d7 1014 g/cm3 , which means the rapid contraction in model LS. Since the profile of\nentropy per baryon is similar to each other, lower density results in lower temperature. The\nrapid contraction also gives rise to the rapid recession of shock wave down to 20 kilometers\nin model LS.\nWe note here on the effective mass. In SH-EOS, the effective mass of nucleons is obtained\nfrom the attraction by scalar mesons in the nuclear many-body framework. The effective\nmass at center is reduced to be 440 MeV at tpb =1 s. The nucleon mass is fixed to be the\nfree nucleon mass in LS-EOS, on the other hand.\nThe temperature difference within 1 second as we have found may affect the following\nevolution of protoneutron star up to several tens of seconds, during which the main part of\nsupernova neutrinos is emitted. Although our models do not give a successful explosion, the\nobtained profiles will still give a good approximation to the initial setup for the subsequent\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nprotoneutron star cooling. Since we have followed the continuous evolution of the central\ncore from the onset of gravitational collapse, the calculated protoneutron star contains the\nhistory of matter and neutrinos during the prior stages. This is much better than the\nsituation so far for calculations of protoneutron star cooling, where the profiles from other\nsupernova simulations were adopted for the initial model. It would be interesting to study\nthe cooling of protoneutron star for the two models obtained here. Even if such evolutions\nof protoneutron star are not associated with a successful supernova explosion, it will be\nstill interesting for the collapsar scenario of GRB and/or black hole formation. Exploratory\nstudies on various scenarios for the fate of compact objects with continuous accretion of\nmatter are fascinating and currently under way, but it is beyond the scope of the present\nstudy.\nIn Fig. 12, we display the profiles of entropy and lepton fraction in model LS at tpb =100,\n250, 500 ms and 1 s. The distributions of entropy as well as other quantities (not shown\nhere) at tpb =100 and 250 ms are consistent with the reference model G15 (Liebend\u00f6rfer et\nal. 2005). We have found that the negative gradients in the profiles of entropy and lepton\nfraction commonly appear in late phase for both models. As for entropy per baryon, the\nnegative gradient appears after tpb =100 ms in the region between \u223c0.7M\u2299 and the shock. The\nnegative gradient of lepton fraction appears first in the outer core behind the shock and then\nprevails toward the center till tpb =1 s. Since these regions are unstable against the convection\naccording to the Ledoux criterion, the whole region of proto-neutron star may be convective\nafter core bounce. It has been pointed out that the sign of derivative of thermodynamical\nquantities (\u2202\u03c1/\u2202YL |P,S ) changes in the neutron-rich environment at high densities beyond\n1014 g/cm3 (Sumiyoshi et al. 2004), and the central core may be stabilized in model SH.\nWhether the convection occurs efficiently enough to help the neutrino-driven mechanism for\nexplosion remains to be studied in multi-dimensional \u03bd-radiation-hydrodynamics simulations\nwith SH-EOS.\n\n4.5.\n\nSupernova neutrinos\n\nThe different temperature distribution could affect the neutrino luminosities and spectra. We discuss here the properties of neutrinos emitted during the evolution of supernova\ncore up to 1 second. As we have already discussed in section 4.3, the luminosity of neutrinos\nin model SH is lower than that in model LS after bounce. This difference actually appears\nafter tpb =100 ms as shown in Fig. 13. The initial rise and peak of luminosities in two models\nare quite similar to each other. The peak heights of neutronization burst of electron-type\nneutrino are also similar. The difference, however, gradually becomes larger and apparent\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nafter tpb=200 ms. We remark here that the kinks around tpb =500 ms are numerical artifact\ndue to the rezoning of mass coordinate as discussed in section 2.4. Except for this kink,\nthe luminosities increase in time. For last 150 milliseconds, luminosities show oscillations\nnumerically, therefore, we have plotted smoothed curves by taking average values. It is to\nbe noted that we are interested in the relative differences of supernova neutrinos between\ntwo models.\nThe difference in average energies of neutrinos appears in a similar manner to that in\nluminosities\nas seen in Fig. 14. The average energy presented here is the rms average energy,\np\n2\nE\u03bd = h\u03b5\u03bd i, at the outermost grid point (\u223c7000 km). The average energies up to tpb =100\nms are almost identical in two models and become different from each other afterwards. The\naverage energies in model SH turn out to be lower than those in model LS. Kinks around\ntpb =500 ms appear due to the same reason mentioned above and the curves are smoothed\naround kinks and tpb \u223c1 s to avoid artificial transient behaviors due to the rezoning. At\ntpb =1 s, the gap amounts to be more than a few MeV and has tendency to increase in time.\nThe lower luminosity and average energy in model SH is due to the slow contraction of\nprotoneutron star and, as a result, the slow rise of temperature as seen in Fig. 11. Again,\nit would be interesting to see the subsequent cooling phase of protoneutron star up to \u223c20\nseconds to obtain the main part of supernova neutrinos.\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have performed the numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae by solving\ngeneral relativistic \u03bd-radiation-hydrodynamics in spherical symmetry. We have adopted the\nrelativistic EOS table which is based on the recent advancement of nuclear many-body theory as well as the recent experimental data of unstable nuclei, in addition to the conventional\nLattimer-Swesty EOS. We have done the long-term simulations from the onset of gravitational collapse to the late phase far beyond 300 milliseconds after bounce, which have not\nbeen well studied in previous studies due to the numerical restrictions. This is meant to\nexplore the chance of shock revival and the influence of the new EOS in this stage, and is\nfirst such an attempt.\nWe have found that a successful explosion of supernova core does not occur in neither a\nprompt nor a delayed way, even though we have followed the postbounce evolution up to 1\nsecond with the new EOS table. The numerical simulation using the Lattimer-Swesty EOS\nshows no explosion either, which is in accord with other recent studies and in contrast to\nthe finding by Wilson. Note that Wilson incorporated convective effects into their spherical\nsimulations to obtain successful explosions. The shock wave stalls around 100 milliseconds\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nafter bounce and recedes down to several tens of kilometers to form a stationary accretion\nshock.\nRegardless of the outcome with no explosion we have revealed the differences caused\nby two EOSs in many aspects, which might give some hints for the successful explosion.\nWe have seen the difference in composition of free-protons and nuclei at the collapse phase\nof supernova core in interesting manners. The difference in symmetry energy of two EOSs\nhas caused this effect, which can change the electron capture rates and the resulting size of\nbounce cores. Although the early shock propagations turn out to be similar in the current\nsimulations due to the counter effect by the stiffness of EOS and the neutrino heating,\nthe implementation of up-to-date electron capture rates on nuclei is remaining to be done\nto obtain more quantitatively reliable difference of composition during the collapse phase,\nwhich may then affect the initial shock energy.\nDuring the postbounce evolution around 100 milliseconds after bounce we have seen\nthat the heating rates in two models are different due to the different luminosities and\ncompositions predicted by two EOSs. Unfortunately, the merit of larger inner core found in\nthe model with SH-EOS is mostly canceled by the smaller heating rate, and the behaviors\nof shock wave in the early postbounce phase turn out to be similar in two simulations. In\ngeneral, though, different heating rates by spectral change of neutrinos and compositional\ndifferences due to EOSs might contribute to the revival of shock wave in the neutrino-driven\nmechanism.\nOne of the most important facts we have revealed in the comparison is that larger difference actually appears from 200 milliseconds after bounce when the central core contracts to\nbecome a protoneutron star. The temperature and density profiles display larger differences\nas the protoneutron star shrinks further. It is in this late phase that we are interested to\nsee possible influences of EOS for shock dynamics, since the central density becomes high\nenough and the difference of EOS becomes more apparent. In the current study, we have\nnot found any shock revival in either model. We have found, however, distinctly different\nthermal evolution of protoneutron stars in two models, and the resulting neutrino spectra\nare clearly different at this stage. This difference might have some influence on the accretion\nof matter. The following evolution of protoneutron star cooling or formation of a black hole\nor any other exotic objects will certainly be affected.\nAfter all, the current numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae in spherical\nsymmetry have not given successful explosions, even with a new EOS or after long-term\nevolution. One might argue that this situation indicates the necessity of breaking spherical\nsymmetry, which is also suggested by some observations and has been supported by multidimensional simulations. However, before one goes to the conclusion that the asymmetry is\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nessential in the explosion mechanism, one also has to make efforts to find missing ingredients\nin microphysics (such as hyperons in EOS, for example) in spherically symmetric simulations. Moreover, the spherical simulations serve as a reliable basis for multi-dimensional\ncomputations of \u03bd-radiation-hydrodynamics. Convection may be somehow taken into account effectively in spherical codes as in the stellar evolution codes. These extensions of\nsimulations and microphysics are now in progress. The extension of the relativistic EOS\ntable by including strangeness particles at high densities has been recently made (Ishizuka\n2005) and corresponding neutrino reactions in hyperonic matter are currently being implemented in \u03bd-radiation-hydrodynamics.\nK.
