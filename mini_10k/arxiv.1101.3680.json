It is by now\nwell established that the critical behavior of a manyparticle interacting system located on the nodes of a general network may crucially differ from that of a system\nlocated on the sites of a d-dimensional regular lattice. Of\nparticular interest are the so-called scale-free networks,\nfor which the probability to find a node of degree k (i.e.\nwith k nearest neighbors) vanishes for large k as a power\nlaw\nP (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03bb .\n\n(1)\n\nThe questions we address in this paper concern two\nfundamental principles of critical phenomena: universality and scaling [4]. Both of these questions have to be\nreconsidered when a system resides on a network. Usually, the universality of critical phenomena is understood\nas stating that the thermodynamic properties near the\ncritical point Tc are governed by a small number of global\nfeatures, such as dimensionality, symmetry, and the type\nof interaction. In turn, the scaling hypothesis states that\nthe singular part of a thermodynamic potential near Tc\nhas the form of a generalized homogeneous function.

The essence of relation (2)\nis that the two-variable function F (\u03c4, M ), when appropriately rescaled, is expressed in terms of a single scaling\nvariable leading to the scaling function f\u00b1 (x). The expression (2) gives an example of the scaling function for\nthe Helmholtz potential F (\u03c4, M ). Together with other\nscaling functions - for the equation of state and for thermodynamic functions - this appears to give a suitable and\ncomprehensive description of critical phenomena [7, 8].\nThese scaling functions are also universal in the sense\nexplained above.\nFor systems on scale-free networks the principle of universality is extended: there, the node-degree distribution\nexponent \u03bb in Eq.(1) appears to be a global variable and\nplays a crucial role, similar to the dimension d for systems\non lattices (see e.g. [9\u201314]). All systems that belong to a\ngiven universality class are governed by the same values\nof critical exponents and critical amplitude ratios and\nshare the same universal form of scaling functions. Recently, the scaling function formalism has been applied to\ndescribe the critical behavior of magnetic systems with\nthe structure of a scale-free network [14]. There, scaling\nfunctions for the magnetic equation of state and isothermal susceptibility were derived. In this paper we are\ninterested in the entropic form of the equation of state.\nIn particular this opens the possibility to derive scaling\nfunctions for the heat capacity. These are of wide and\nfundamental interest in the theory of critical phenomena and have been the subject of thorough theoretical\nand experimental studies for various magnetic, fluid, and\n\n\f2\nsuperconducting systems [16\u201323]. A particular point of\ninterest concerns the existence or non-existence of the\nmoments of the distribution (1) on the universal behavior.\nThe set-up of the the paper is as follows: in section\nII we define the notations and derive expressions for\nthe entropic equation of state, heat capacity and magnetocaloric coefficient scaling functions for systems on\nscale-free networks. These expressions are further analyzed and compared with corresponding functions for\nbulk systems in section III. The paper concludes with a\nsummary and an outlook in section IV.\nII.\n\nFREE ENERGY AND SCALING\nFUNCTIONS\n\nThe critical behavior of a many-particle system interacting on a scale-free network crucially depends on the\nnode degree distribution P (k) via the decay exponent \u03bb\nin Eq.(1) [1]. In particular, for an infinite network the\nvalue of \u03bb determines the order of the first diverging moment, this order being the lowest integer j \u2265 \u03bb \u2212 1. This\nis reflected by the phase transition scenario. For low values of \u03bb \u2264 3 the system remains ordered for any finite\ntemperature, whereas for \u03bb > 3 a finite temperature,\norder-disorder phase transition occurs. Moreover, critical\nexponents that govern a second-order phase transition in\na scale-free network attain their usual mean-field values\nfor high \u03bb > 5 and demonstrate non-trivial \u03bb-dependence\nin the region 3 < \u03bb < 5. Logarithmic corrections to scaling laws appear at \u03bb = 5: this resembles phenomena that\noccur at marginal space or order parameter dimensions\nin bulk systems [24].\nA starting point for our analysis will be the expression\nfor the free energy of a system with scalar order parameter on a scale-free network. To be specific, from now on\nwe will consider ferromagnetic ordering and the spontaneous magnetization M as the order parameter with the\nconjugate magnetic field H. In this case the corresponding microscopic degrees of freedom are the Ising spins.\nHowever, generalization to models of more complicated\nsymmetry is straightforward [12, 13]. Due to the fact\nthat the type of networks under discussion are assumed\nto have a local tree-like structure, the mean-field approximation is asymptotically exact in the sense that thermal\nfluctuations can be neglected. This leads to a form of the\nfree energy also found by other techniques. The lowest\norder contributions to the singular part of the Helmholtz\nfree energy in the vicinity of Tc are [9\u201311]\na\n(T \u2212 Tc )M 2 +\n2\na\nF (M, T ) = (T \u2212 Tc )M 2 +\n2\nF (M, T ) =\n\nb 4\nM , \u03bb > 5,\n(3)\n4\nb \u03bb\u22121\nM\n, 3 < \u03bb < 5.

Since \u03c4 measures the absolute distance to the critical point, the free\nenergy has two branches, corresponding to signs '+' and\n'\u2212' in Eqs. (5) and (6) for T > Tc and T < Tc , respectively. It is easy to verify, that a system with the free\nenergy (5), (6) possesses a second-order phase transition\nat \u03c4 = 0.

The scaling variable is\nx = m/\u03c4 \u03b2 . The ratio \u0393+ /\u0393\u2212 is taken from Ref. [13] and\nscaling functions f\u00b1 , H\u00b1 , and \u03c7\u00b1 follow from Ref. [14].\n\nupon an isothermal increase of the magnetic field and is\ndefined as (see e.g. [26])\n\u2202M\n\u2202T\n\nMT = \u2212T\n\nH\n\n.\n\n(40)\n\nIn contradistinction to the heat capacity, which often\ndoes not diverge or is a weakly divergent quantity for\nmany 3d systems, the magnetocaloric coefficient is frequently strongly divergent at second-order phase transitions [22, 26] and therefore it is instructive to analyze how\nthis behavior is modified by a scale-free network. Using\nMaxwell relations, MT can be obtained both from the\nmagnetic or from the entropic equations of state, Eqs.\n(17), (18). Therefore an equivalent representation to the\none given in (40) representation reads:\nMT = \u2212T\n\n\u2202S\n\u2202H\n\nT\n\n.\n\n(41)\n\nAnalogous to the first equation in (7), we define the dimensionless isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient as\nmT =\n\nMT\n.\nM0\n\n(42)\n\nFrom the above representation this is\nmT = \u2212(1 \u00b1 \u03c4 )\n\n\u2202s(m, \u03c4 )\n\u2202m\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u2202m(\u03c4, h)\n.\n\u2202h\n\u03c4\n\n(43)\n\nRecognizing that the last term in (43) is a dimensionless\nisothermal susceptibility \u03c7T (\u03c4, m) and writing it in the\nscaling form\n\u03c7T = \u03c4 \u2212\u03b3 \u03c7\u00b1 (x),\n\nx = m/\u03c4 \u03b2 ,\n\n(44)\n\nwe arrive at the scaling representation for the dimensionless isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient mT\nmT = (1 \u00b1 \u03c4 )\u03c4 \u2212\u03c9 M\u00b1 (x),\n\n(45)\n\n\f5\nwith the scaling function\nM\u00b1 (x) = x\u03c7\u00b1 (x),\n\n(46)\n\nand a scaling relation for the isothermal magnetocaloric\ncoefficient critical exponent \u03c9,\n\u03c9 =1\u2212\u03b2.\n\n(47)\n\nWhile the equality (47) is a general one and directly follows from the scaling form of Eq. (43), the relation (46)\nbetween functions M\u00b1 (x) and \u03c7\u00b1 (x) holds only for systems where the entropy scaling function has the simple\nrepresentation (27).\nAs noticed above, another way to obtain mT is to start\nfrom the magnetic equation of state using the representation (40). Then one obtains\n\u2202m(\u03c4, h)\nmT = \u2213(1 \u00b1 \u03c4 )\n.\n\u2202\u03c4\nh\n\n(48)\n\nComparing this expression with the formulas obtained\nabove for the heat capacity (23), (24) one arrives at the\nrelation between the scaling functions M\u00b1 (x) and C\u00b1 (x),\nC\u00b1 (x) = xM\u00b1 (x),\n\n(49)\n\nwhich in particular leads to (c.f. (46))\nC\u00b1 (x) = x2 \u03c7\u00b1 (x).\n\n(50)\n\nThe scaling function M\u00b1 (x) defined above is displayed\nfor different ranges of the values of \u03bb in table II. For the\ncritical exponents \u03c9 we get\n\u03bb\u22124\n,\n\u03c9=\n\u03bb\u22123\n\n3 < \u03bb < 5;\n\n\u03c9 = 1/2,\n\n\u03bb > 5.\n\n(51)\n\nIt is easy to find the scaling relation for the critical exponent \u03c9c that governs the field dependence of mT (\u03c4 = 0, h)\n[22]:\n\u03c9c =\n\n1\u2212\u03b2\n.\n\u03b2\u03b4\n\n(52)\n\nThe values of this exponent read\n\u03c9c =\n\n\u03bb\u22124\n,\n\u03bb\u22122\n\n3 < \u03bb < 5;\n\n\u03c9c = 1/3,\n\n\u03bb > 5.\n\nfunction P (k), Eq. (1) relate to changes in the scaling\nscenario of these systems. As one can see from (51), (53)\nthe exponents \u03c9 and \u03c9c change their sign to become negative for \u03bb < 4: mT is not divergent at the critical point\nany more in the region 3 < \u03bb < 4. Therefore, along with\nthe two marginal values of \u03bb = 5 and \u03bb = 3 which correspond to the divergencies of hk 4 i and hk 2 i and define\nthe 'window' of non-trivial critical behavior on a scalefree network. The divergence of the third moment of\nthe node-degree distribution hk 3 i leads to a qualitative\nchange in the critical behavior of the isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient.\nIII.\n\nAs one can see from table I, the heat capacity exponent\n\u03b1 is negative in the region 3 < \u03bb < 5 where a non-trivial\n\u03b1(\u03bb) dependence is observed. This means that the singular part of the heat capacity ch vanishes at Tc . Taken that\nch vanishes also at T = 0 and that it is a positive smooth\nfunction of T in between, one concludes that it has a\nmaximum at some temperature T0 , where 0 < T0 < Tc\nfor any 3 < \u03bb < 5. Therefore the energy fluctuations\nare maximal at T0 (see [13] for more details). Such behavior is a generic feature of systems with \u03b1 < 0, other\nexamples include the three dimensional Heisenberg and\nplanar magnets [27], liquid helium [28], and disordered\nuniaxial magnets [29]. From Eqs.(31) and (36) one finds\nthat ch (T > Tc , h = 0) = 0 for any \u03bb. This leads to the\nfollowing amplitude ratio which holds for all \u03bb > 3:\nA+ /A\u2212 = 0.\n\n(54)\n\nAmplitude ratios are known to be universal along with\nthe scaling functions and critical exponents (see e.g. [8]).\nIt is appropriate to adduce here how do these ratios\nchange for systems on scale-free networks. The results\nare summarized in the lower part of table II. Besides\nthan the heat capacity amplitude ratio (54), the isothermal magnetic-susceptibility amplitude ratio appears to\nbe \u03bb-dependent for 3 < \u03bb < 5: \u0393+ /\u0393\u2212 = \u03bb \u2212 3 [13].\nUsing the expressions (28), (31), (34), (36) it is straightforward to find for the other amplitudes for \u03bb > 5\n\n(53)\n\nThus while ch does not diverge (\u03b1 < 0) for the entire\nrange 3 < \u03bb < 5, mT is divergent (\u03c9 > 0) over half\nthat range 4 < \u03bb < 5, and is a better locator of the\nphase transition there. The above calculated exponents\n\u03c9, \u03c9c are displayed together with other exponents in the\ncomprehensive table I, which presents a summary of the\ndata concerning the temperature and field behavior of\ndifferent thermodynamic quantities in the vicinity of the\ncritical point for different values of \u03bb. In the course of the\nanalysis of different types of critical phenomena in scalefree networks [1], it has been revealed that the onset of\ndivergencies of moments of the node-degree distribution\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nB = Dc = 1,\n\nAc = 1/3,\n\n(55)\n\nand for 3 < \u03bb < 5,\n4 \u00111/(\u03bb\u22123)\n\u03bb\u22121\n,\nDc =\n,\n\u03bb\u22121\n4\n1 \u0010 4 \u00113/(\u03bb\u22122)\n=\n.\n\u03bb\u22122 \u03bb\u22121\n\nB =\nAc\n\n\u0010\n\n(56)\n\nNow, defining three more amplitude ratios by [8, 18, 19]\nR\u03c7 = \u0393+ Dc B \u03b4\u22121 ,\n+ +\n\n(58)\n\nAc Dc\u2212(1+\u03b1c ) B \u22122/\u03b2 ,\n\n(59)\n\nRc = A \u0393 /B ,\nRA =\n\n(57)\n\n2\n\n\f6\nand substituting into these ratios the amplitudes (55) and\n(56), we arrive at their values for the scale-free network,\nas listed in table II.\nLet us concentrate now on the scaling functions. As\nnoted in section II, the entropy scaling function S\u00b1 (x)\nwhich in the usual Landau theory is given by Eq. (27)\nkeeps its form also in the case of scale-free networks with\n3 < \u03bb < 5. However, the constant-magnetic-field heat\ncapacity scaling function C\u00b1 essentially changes in this\nregion. In Fig. 1 we plot C\u00b1 as a function of the scaling\nvariable x = m/\u03c4 \u03b2 for different values of \u03bb. The most\nstriking feature in the behavior of the scaling function is\nthat its asymptotics for large x change for \u03bb < 5. Indeed,\nfor \u03bb > 5 the asymptotical value is given by a constant,\nC\u00b1 (x \u2192 \u221e) = 1/3, whereas in the range 3 < \u03bb < 5 the\nfunction behaves as a power law,\nC\u00b1 (x \u2192 \u221e) =\n\n4\nx5\u2212\u03bb .\n(\u03bb \u2212 1)(\u03bb \u2212 2)\n\n(60)\n\nIn turn, this is reflected in the development of a minimum\nin the C\u2212 branch of the function as \u03bb decreases (see the\nfigure).\n\na non-zero magnetic field must increase the value of m\none arrives at the following minimal values of the scaling\nvariable x:\nxmin = 1, \u03bb > 5,\n\u0010 4 \u00111/(\u03bb\u22123)\n,\nxmin =\n\u03bb\u22121\n\n(61)\n3 < \u03bb < 5.\n\n(62)\n\nTherefore, the curves for the scaling function C\u2212 in Fig.\n1 originate at the corresponding minimal values of x defined by the relations (61), (62).\nIn turn, as explained in section II, one may re-express\nthe scaling function C\u00b1 in terms of the scaled magnetic\nfield y using Eq. (37). Corresponding plots for the scaling function C\u00b1 (y) in this variable are given in Fig. 2\nfor different values of \u03bb. Again, one observes a change in\nthe asymptotics of the scaling function: instead of a constant at \u03bb > 5, for 3 < \u03bb < 5 the asymptotic functional\ndependence is given by\nC\u00b1 (y \u2192 \u221e) =\n\n3\n5\u2212\u03bb\n1 \u0010 4 \u0011 \u03bb\u22122\ny \u03bb\u22122 .\n(\u03bb \u2212 2) (\u03bb \u2212 1)\n\n(63)\n\n1.0\n1.0\n\nC\n\nC\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0.0\n\nx\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\ny\nFIG. 1: Heat capacity scaling functions C\u2212 (x) (dotted curves,\nblue online) and C+ (x) (solid curves, red online) as functions\nof the scaling variable x = m/\u03c4 \u03b2 at \u03bb > 5, \u03bb = 4.8, and \u03bb =\n4.5 (lower, middle and upper pairs of curves, respectively).\n\nAnother particular feature of the plots of Fig. 1 is\ninherent to the presentation of the scaling plots in the\nC\u2212 \u2013x-plane and is connected to the presence of a pole\nin C\u00b1 (x) for small x.

However, the physical values of the scaling variable x do not cover the region where the pole\noccurs. Indeed, from the magnetic equations of state\n(28), (34) one may obtain the solutions for the magnetization at zero magnetic field m(\u03c4, h = 0).

As discussed at the end of the previous section,\nmT changes its behavior at \u03bb = 4.

Different systems that share the same values\nof these global variables manifest the same criticality. A\nclassical example is given by the famous 3d Ising model\nuniversality class that is inherent to the critical behavior of such differing systems as uniaxial magnets, simple\n\nFIG. 4: Isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient scaling functions M\u2212 (y) (dotted curves, blue online) and M+ (y) (solid\ncurves, red online) as functions of the scaling variable y =\nm/\u03c4 \u03b2\u03b4 at \u03bb > 5, \u03bb = 4, and \u03bb = 3.8 (lower, middle and upper\npairs of curves, respectively).\n\nfluids or binary alloys. The critical behavior in all these\nsystems is quantitatively described by the same values\nof the critical exponents, amplitude ratios, and by the\nsame form of the scaling functions. As this paper demonstrates, in particular the usual 'Euclidean space' understanding of universality of critical phenomena breaks\ndown if the critical behavior occurs on a scale-free network. The presence of high-degree vertices (hubs) may\nlead to substantial changes in ordering processes. The\nparameter that controls the 'importance' of the hubs is\nthe node-degree distribution exponent \u03bb, Eq. (1), and it\nis this parameter that plays the role of a global variable\nas far as the critical behavior is considered.\nIn particular, the universal quantities that govern criticality become \u03bb-dependent for small enough \u03bb and in\nthis way the network structure is felt. However, the presence of magnetization is necessary to 'feel' the network\nstructure. To give an example, the structure matters for\nT < Tc at any h and for T > Tc for h 6= 0 (c.f. that\namplitude \u0393\u2212 is \u03bb-dependent, whereas \u0393+ is not). Another interesting observation is that the fluctuation in\nnetwork structure only enters via the magnetization and\nsince the entropy S is measured at constant magnetization, it is given by a usual Landau-like mean field value\nfor any \u03bb > 3. This makes a difference between the global\nparameters \u03bb and dimension d regarding its influence of\nthe fluctuations on calculating the singular behaviour of\nthe physical quantities: no renormalization-group calculation is necessary.\n\n\f8\nIn this paper we completed the quantitative description of critical behavior in scale-free networks by calculating the entropic equation of state, the resulting scaling\nfunctions as well as the universal amplitude ratios. The\ncorresponding formulas, together with other data for the\ncritical exponents and amplitudes are summarized in Tables I and II. They constitute a comprehensive list of observables that describe the scaling and characterize the\ncriticality in scale-free networks.\nThe starting point for our study was the asymptotic\nform of the free energy in the vicinity of a critical point in\na scale-free network, Eqs. (3), (4). The validity of this expression has been proven at different levels of rigor using\nmicroscopic approaches based on the recursion relations\n[10] the replica method [9] or phenomenological Landau\napproaches [11, 13] as well as mean field theory [12]. It is\n\ninstructive to note here that, because the networks under\ndiscussion have a local tree-like structure, the mean-field\napproximation is asymptotically exact. One of the consequences of this fact is that the values of the exponents\ndo not change if an O(m)-symmetrical order parameter\nis considered (see e.g. [13]), as it is usual in the Landau\ntheory.\n\n[1] S.
