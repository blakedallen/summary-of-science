Fernandes\n\n1. Introduction\nThe interaction between a particle and a scalar field when both have a non-Abelian internal\nspace is still a matter of investigation. In one of the first works regarding the subject, Wong [1]\nproposes an expression, derived from the Dirac equation, for the classical interaction between a\nparticle with SU 2 internal symmetry group and a vector field, namely, the Yang-Mills gauge\nfield. However, there was no reference to the interaction with a scalar field. Feh\u00e9r [2] generalises\nWong's procedure to five dimensions in an attempt to take into account the existence of a scalar\nfield, but as already pointed out by Azizi [3], the generalisation seems too much unnatural. In his\nown work, Azizi makes use of a fifth dynamical dimension in order to generalise again Wong's\nprocedure, but the expression he achieves for the quadri-force, although consistent in a Newtonian\nlimit, is inconsistent in a relativistic frame, since it is not orthogonal to the quadri-velocity of the\nparticle.\nTherefore, we propose a consistent way to obtain the expression of the quadri-force describing\nthe interaction of a particle and a scalar field by looking directly for its possible forms compatible\nwith Special Relativity dynamics. The temporal evolution of the internal vector, which is the other\nrelevant equation of motion, is achieved considering a natural extension of Wong's expression. We\ninvestigate the expressions proposed in a general scenario and then specialise to the case in which\nthe scalar field is a soliton type configuration of the non-linear O 3 model. For this particular\nsystem, we make analytical studies of its stability and asymptotic behaviour, complementing with\nnumerical evaluation of some orbits and Lyapunov exponents.\nIn Section 2 we explicitly state the equations of motion due to the particle's interaction with a\nscalar field multiplete in the observer frame and investigate their Newtonian limit and the question\nif they can be expressed as Hamilton equations. In Section 3, we take the expressions of the soliton\nfield configurations of the non-linear O 3 model and apply to the previous equations of motion.\nHence, we study the stability and the asymptotic behaviour of the resultant system in Section 4 and\nalso calculate numerically some Lyapunov exponents. Finally, in Section 5, based on the fact that\nthe considered model describes an isotropic ferromagnet, we make a physical interpretation of the\nsystem.\n\n\u0006\u0007\n\n\u0006\u0007\n\n2. Quadri-force and equations of motion\nTo construct the quadri-force, first of all, we have to respect the basic relativistic property\nthat quadri-acceleration must be orthogonal to quadri-velocity, since u \u03bc u\u03bc 1. If, in addition, we\nimpose a minimum coupling between the internal vector of the particle (its generalised charge) and\nthe scalar field, we can settle that there are basically two possible forms for the quadri-force: one\nis achieved by using the totally antisymmetric tensor \u03b5 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1 , namely:\n\n\b\n\n\b\n\ndx\u03bd a a\n\u03c6 I W\u03c1\n(2.1)\nd\u03c4 \u03bb\nin which q is the coupling constant, \u03c6 a the scalar field, I a the internal vector of the particle, x \u03bc \u03c4\nits world line and \u03c4 its proper time. Let us analyse the undetermined term W\u03c1 : it cannot be related\nto the scalar field, since we are assuming minimum coupling, and cannot be quadri-velocity either.\nHence, the remaining possibilities for it are the quadri-acceleration or an external field, which are\nK\n\n\u03bc\n\nq\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\n\n042 / 2\n\n\u0006\u0007\n\nPoS(WC2004)042\n\n\u0006\u0007\n\n\fMotion of Coloured Particles...\n\nRafael M. Fernandes\n\nrather artificial for the motion of a single particle and will not be considered in the scope of this\npaper.\nThe other possible form for the quadri-force is written in terms of the usual tensor that projects\nany vector in the subspace orthogonal to the quadri-velocity:\nK\u03bc\n\n\b\n\nm\n\nd 2 x\u03bc\nd\u03c42\n\n\b\n\nq \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n\ndx\u03bc dx\u03bd\nd\u03c4 d\u03c4\n\n\u03c6a\u03bd I a\n\n(2.2)\n\n\u0006\u0007\n\n\b \u000f\n\ndI a\ndx\u03bc\nq\u03b5abc \u03c6b\u03bc I c\n0\n(2.3)\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\nNext, we move to the observer frame, which is related to the particle's frame by the wellknown identity dt \u03b3d\u03c4. Assuming that the field does not depend upon time explicitly, we reach\nthe following dynamical system:\n\n\u000e\n\n\b\n\n\b\n\n\u0011 \b\u0013\u0012 \u0011 \u0014 \u0011 \u0015\n\n\u0010\n\n\b\n\nq 2 a a\nI \u03c6 j vj\n(2.4)\n\u03b3 \u03c6 j I ; I \u0307\nm\nin which we have used the convention that a observer time derivative is represented by (  \u0307 ) and a\nvectorial notation for the internal variables. The dynamical system (2.4) has the desirable property\nof respecting symmetries of the field, i.e., if the latter does not depend upon a certain coordinate,\nthen there will be no acceleration in the respective direction. We can also note that the module of\nthe isospin is a constant of motion, whilst the energy seems not to be, since we have the equation:\n\u1e8b j\n\n\b\n\nv j ; v\u0307 j\n\nd\ndt\n\nm ln\n\nT\nm\n\n\u0011 \u0016 \u0011 \b q\u03c6\u0011 \u0016 dI\u0011\ndt\n\u000e\nq\u03c6 I\n\n(2.5)\n\nin which T m\u03b3 is the total relativistic kinetic energy of the particle. Hence, it is clear that the\norigin of the dissipation in the system is the coupling to the isospin, which varies in time in general.\nHowever, if there is a special situation in which it is constant in time, then energy will be conserved;\nwe observe that such situation can be achieved only if the isospin is parallel, in the internal space, to\n \u0307\nthe time derivative of the field. To see that, we write equation (2.3) in the observer frame, I \u0307 I \u03c6,\nfrom where we conclude that, if the internal vector is to remain constant, the time derivative of the\nfield and, consequently, the field itself after a certain time, must point always in the same direction\nin the internal space. Hence, if one considers soliton type configuration of the fields, this condition\nwill just be satisfied by zero topological charge solitons.\nA last important remark to be made about (2.2) and (2.3) is when one considers scalar fields\ncoming from gauge invariant Lagrangians (such as the Higgs fields in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian).\nThe expressions may easily be made also gauge invariant by replacing the ordinary derivatives by\nthe respective covariant ones.\n\n\u0011\b \u0011\u0014 \u0011\n\n042 / 3\n\nPoS(WC2004)042\n\nin which \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd is the Minkowskian metric. This expression is quadratic in the velocity and does not\nshow any problem at a first sight. Moreover, it is very similar to the expression Barut [4] considers\nfor a scalar field with no internal symmetry.\nThe other equation of motion that must be constructed is the one involving the precession of\nthe internal vector. Considering the internal particle's space to be the SU 2 symmetry group (in\nwhich case I a is called the isospin of the particle) and then making the simplest generalisation of\nWong's proposal by replacing the vector field A a\u03bc by \u03c6a\u03bc , we are lead to:\n\n\fMotion of Coloured Particles...\n\nRafael M.

Specialisation to the non-linear O 3 model\nAll the formalism we have developed in the section before may now be applied to a concrete\ncase to see the basic features of the system. We choose a scalar field multiplete with no gauge\nsymmetry by taking a soliton type field configuration of the non-linear O 3 model.

Observing that \u03c6ai r \u221e\ntotically, the isospin and the velocity of the particle become constant and, hence, its orbit on the\nx y plane is a straight line. Combining this with the fact that all the equilibrium points of the\ndynamical system are unstable, we conclude that there is no limited orbit for this system.\nTherefore, it is useful to know how the distance between two initially close escaping orbits\ngrows, to look for the possibility of chaotic behaviour. Hence, we calculated numerically the\ngreatest Lyapunov exponent of various pairs of orbits, each with two initial conditions lying near a\nsaddle point: one in the repulsive direction (positive eigenvector) and the other in the attractive one\n(negative eigenvector). All of the exponents were found to vanish.\nAs an example, let us consider for instance two initial conditions near the saddle point x\n0 1 y 0 2 , according to the parametrisation (4.1), for the system with \u03b5 1. Figure 1 a\nshows that the function L t\nln d t d 0 t vanishes asymptotically and, hence, the Lyapunov\nexponent is zero. This is confirmed by figure 1 b , in which we have calculated the quotient\nd t d 0 of the Euclidean distance between the orbits, in phase space, after a period t by the\ninitial distance. The periods were equally separated in time. We have made a linear regression\nfor the points and calculated the linear correlation of them, obtaining a value very close to unity.\nHence, the quotient d t d 0 can be fairly approximated by a straight line, what implies in a\nvanishing Lyapunov exponent. We stress that the fact that the regression line does not contain the\npoint 0 1 should not cause concern as long as we are interested in the global behaviour of the\nquotient rather than in the local.\n\n\u0006 B \u0007\b\n\n\u0006 \u0007\n\n\u000f \b \u000f\u0007\n\u0006 \u0007C. \u0006 \u0007\n\n\u0006 \u0007\n\n\u0006 \u0007 \b \u0006 \u0006 \u0007C. \u0006 \u0007C\u0007D.\n\n\u0006\u0007\n\n\u0006 \u0007C. \u0006 \u0007\n\n042 / 6\n\n\b\n\n\u0006 \b\n\u0006\u0007\n\nPoS(WC2004)042\n\n(a)\n\n0\n0\n\n3000\n\n\fMotion of Coloured Particles...\n\nRafael M.

We observe that, again, \u03c6ai r\nthe same as before. Moreover, as soon as the module of the scalar field is constant for any of\nthese configurations, the equilibrium condition is again given by v x vy 0 and I a\n\u03c6a and the\nequilibrium points again lie on a surface.

The equilibrium\ncondition we were lead to is that the isospin of the particle has the same direction, in the internal\nspace, of the spin in each point of the ferromagnet. As the spin configuration has unity topological\ncharge, it points in different directions for each point in the ferromagnet. Therefore, if the particle is\nleft in a certain point in the ferromagnet in equilibrium condition but is given a very small velocity,\nit will move to a point where the equilibrium condition will no longer be satisfied. Hence, to reach\nequilibrium, the particle will try to align its isospin with the new direction of the spin, but, as the\nparticle is moving, this process will go on, making the isospin precessionate and the particle keep\nits motion, as it is exchanging energy with \u03c6 a , until it reaches a region of the space where the\nmodule of the order parameter is negligible.\nThe authors acknowledges FAPESP and CNPQ for financial support.\n\n\b\n\n\u0006 \u0007\n\n\b\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
