Introduction and Main Results\nDenote by H the class of all complex-valued harmonic functions f in the unit\ndisk D = {z \u2208 C : |z| < 1} normalized by f (0) = 0 = fz (0) \u2212 1. Each f can be\ndecomposed as f = h + g, where g and h are analytic in D so that [6, 8]\n(1.1)\n\nh(z) = z +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nan z n and g(z) =\n\nn=2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nbn z n .\n\nn=1\n\nLet SH denote the class of univalent and orientation-preserving functions f = h + g\nin H. Then the Jacobian of f is given by Jf (z) = |h\u2032 (z)|2 \u2212 |g \u2032 (z)|2 . We note that if\nf = h + g \u2208 SH and g(z) \u2261 0 in D, then f = h \u2208 S, where S denotes the well-known\nclass of normalized univalent analytic functions in D. A necessary and sufficient\ncondition (see [6] or Lewy [10]) for a harmonic function f to be locally univalent\nin D is that Jf (z) > 0 in D. The function \u03c9(z) = g \u2032 (z)/h\u2032 (z) denotes the complex\ndilatation of f . Thus, for f = h + g \u2208 SH with g \u2032 (0) = b1 and |b1 | < 1 (because\nJf (0) = 1 \u2212 |b1 |2 > 0), the function\nF =\n\nf \u2212 b1 f\n1 \u2212 |b1 |2\n\nis also in SH . Thus, it is customary to restrict our attention to the subclass\n0\nSH\n= {f \u2208 SH : fz (0) = 0}.\n\nFile: KaPoVu_final6.tex, printed:\n\n2018-5-26, 0.36\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 30C45.\nKey words and phrases.

Vuorinen\n\n0\nThe family SH\nis known to be compact. The uniqueness result of the Riemann\nmapping theorem does not extend to these classes of harmonic functions, [6, 8].\nSeveral authors have studied the subclass of functions that map D onto specific\n\u2217\ndomains, eg. starlike domains, convex and close-to-convex domains. Let SH\n(KH ,\nCH resp.) consist of all sense-preserving harmonic mappings f = h+g \u2208 H of D onto\n\u22170\n0\n0\nstarlike (convex, close-to-convex, resp.) domains. Denote by SH\n(KH\n, CH\nresp.) the\n\u2217\nclass consists of those functions f in SH (KH , CH resp.) for which fz (0) = 0.\nIn [6, Lemma 5.15], Clunie and Sheil-Small proved the following result.\n\nLemma A. If h, g are analytic in D with |h\u2032 (0)| > |g \u2032(0)| and h + \u01ebg is close-toconvex for each \u01eb, |\u01eb| = 1, then f = h + g is close-to-convex in D.\n0\nThis lemma has been used to obtain many important results. In the case of SH\n,\n0\nwe have the harmonic Koebe function K = H + G in SH , where\n\n(1.2)\n\nH(z) =\n\n1 2\nz \u2212 12 z 2 + 61 z 3\nz + 61 z 3\n2\nand\nG(z)\n=\n.\n(1 \u2212 z)3\n(1 \u2212 z)3\n\nWe see that the function K has the dilatation \u03c9(z) = z and K maps the unit disk\nD onto the slit plane C\\{u + iv : u \u2264 \u22121/6, v = 0}. Moreover,\nH(z) = z +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nAn z\n\nn\n\nn=2\n\nwhere\n\nand G(z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nBn z n ,\n\nn=2\n\n1\n1\nAn = (2n + 1)(n + 1) and Bn = (2n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 1), n \u2265 1.\n6\n6\nA well-known coefficient conjecture of Clunie and Sheil-Small [6], is that if f =\n0\nh + g \u2208 SH\nthen the Taylor coefficients of the series of h and g satisfy the inequality\n\n(1.3)\n\n(1.4)\n\n|an | \u2264 An and |bn | \u2264 Bn for all n \u2265 1.\n\nAlthough, the coefficients conjecture remains an open problem for the full class\n0\nSH\n, the same has been verified for certain subclasses, namely, the class TH (see [8,\nSection 6.6]) of harmonic univalent typically real functions, the class of harmonic\n0\nconvex functions in one direction, harmonic starlike functions in SH\n(see [8, Section\n6.7]), and the class of harmonic close-to-convex functions (see [17]).\nIt is interesting to know to what extent do the conditions (1.4) influence the\nunivalency of the normalized harmonic function f (z) and of all of its partial sums,\nnamely, fn (z) and fm (z), where\nfn (z) = hn (z) + gm (z) if n \u2265 m; fm (z) = hn (z) + gm (z) if m \u2265 n.\n\nHere hn (z) and gm (z) represent the n-th section/partial sums of h and g given by\nhn (z) = z +\n\nn\nX\nk=2\n\nak z\n\nk\n\nand gm (z) =\n\nm\nX\n\nbk z k ,\n\nk=1\n\nrespectively. According to our notation, the degree of the polynomials fn (z) and\nfm (z) is n if n = m.\n\n\fHarmonic Mappings\n\n3\n\nTheorem 1.5. Let h and g have the form (1.1) and the coefficients of the series\nsatisfy the conditions (1.4). Then f = h + g is close-to-convex (univalent), and\nstarlike in the disk |z| < rS , where\nr\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n1\n\u2212\nrS = 1 +\n2 + \u2248 0.112903\n4\n8\nis the root of the quadratic equation\n\u221a 2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2 r \u2212 (1 + 2 2) r + 2 \u2212 1 = 0\nin the interval (0, 1). The result is sharp.\n\nThe radii problems for various subclasses of univalent harmonic mappings are\nopen [2, Problem 3.3] (see also [6, 8, 15, 14]). However, Theorem 1.5 quickly yields\nCorollary 1.6. The radius of close-to-convexity and the radius of starlikeness for\n\u22170\n0\nmappings in SH\n(resp. CH\nand TH ) is at least 0.112903.\nUnder the hypotheses of Theorem 1.5, all the partial sums of f are close-to-convex\n(univalent), and starlike in |z| < rS . Similar comments apply to the next two results.\nAnother well-known result due to Clunie and Sheil-Small [6] states that the coef0\nsatisfy the\nficients of the series of h and g of every convex function f = h + g \u2208 KH\ninequalities\nn+1\nn\u22121\n(1.7)\n|an | \u2264\nand |bn | \u2264\nfor all n \u2265 1.\n2\n2\n0\n, where\nEquality occurs for the function L = M + N \u2208 KH\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n1\n1\nz\nz\nz\nz\n(1.8)\nM(z) =\nand N(z) =\n.\n+\n\u2212\n2 1 \u2212 z (1 \u2212 z)2\n2 1 \u2212 z (1 \u2212 z)2\nWe observe that\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nz\nn+1 n Xn\u22121 n\nz\n+ Im\n=z+\nz \u2212\nz .\nL(z) = Re\n1\u2212z\n(1 \u2212 z)2\n2\n2\nn=2\nn=2\n\nAt this place it is worth recalling that the convexity (resp. starlikness) property\nis not a hereditary property in the harmonic case, unlike the analytic case. For\ninstance,\n\u221a the convex function L maps the subdisk\n\u221a |z| < r onto a convex domain for\nr \u2264 2 \u2212 1, but onto a non-convex domain for 2 \u2212 1 < r < 1.\n\nTheorem 1.9. Let h and g have the form (1.1) and the coefficients of the series\nsatisfy the conditions (1.7).

Let h and g have the form (1.1) with |b1 | < 1, f = h + g, and satisfy\nthe condition\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n(2.2)\nn|an | +\nn|bn | \u2264 1.\nn=2\n\nn=1\n\n2\n2\nThen f \u2208 CH\n, where CH\n= {f \u2208 SH : |fz (z) \u2212 1| < 1 \u2212 |fz (z)| in D}. The bound in\n(2.2) is sharp as the harmonic function\n\nf (z) = z +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u01ebn\nn=2\n\nfor which\n\nP\u221e\n\nn=2\n\n|\u01ebn | +\n\nP\u221e\n\n\u2032\nn=1 |\u01ebn |\n\nn\n\nzn +\n\n= 1, shows.\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u01eb\u2032\n\nn n\nz ,\n\nn=1\n\nn\n\nProof. In [13], it was shown that Re fz (z) > |fz (z)| whenever (2.2) holds. The proof\nof this lemma follows from an easy modification of the proof of the corresponding\nresult from [13]. For the sake of completeness, we include the detail. Note that the\ncoefficient inequality implies that both h and g are analytic in D. Thus, f = h + g\nis harmonic in D. Without loss of generality, we may assume that f is not affine.\nThen, as fz = h\u2032 and fz = g \u2032 , it follows from the hypotheses that\n\u2032\n\n|h (z) \u2212 1| \u2264\n\u2264\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=2\n\u221e\nX\nn=2\n\nn|an | |z|n\u22121\nn|an | \u2264 1 \u2212\n\n\u2264 1 \u2212 |g \u2032(z)|\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=1\n\nn|bn |\n\n2\nimplying that f \u2208 CH\n(since strict inequality occurs either at the second or fourth\ninequality). In particular, Re h\u2032 (z) > |g \u2032 (z)| in D and hence, f is locally univalent\nin D.\n\u0003\n\nFor example, the functions\nfn (z) = z +\n\nn+1 n n\u22121 n\nz +\nz for n \u2265 2\n2n2\n2n2\n\n\f6\n\nD.

In the following lemma,\n2\nwe show that functions in CH are indeed close-to-convex in D.\n\nLemma 2.3. Let h and g have the form (1.1) with |b1 | < 1, f = h + g. Suppose\n2\nf \u2208 CH\n. Then, we have the following\n(a) f is close-to-convex in D.\n(b) |an | \u2212 |bn | \u2264 1/n for n \u2265 2 whenever b1 = 0.

First we prove part (a). Let f = h + g \u2208 CH\nThen,\n|F \u2032(z) \u2212 1| \u2264 |h\u2032 (z) \u2212 1| + |g \u2032(z)| < 1\nshowing that F is analytic and close-to-convex in D. According to Lemma A, it\nfollows that the harmonic function f is also close-to-convex (and univalent) in D.\nNext, set \u03c9(z) = F \u2032 (z) \u2212 1. Then, as b1 = g \u2032 (0) = 0, we have \u03c9(0) = 0 and\n|\u03c9(z)| < 1 for z \u2208 D. It is well-known property that the coefficients of such an\nanalytic function \u03c9 satisfy the inequality |\u03c9 (n) (0)| \u2264 n! for each n \u2265 1. This gives\nthe estimate\n|nan + \u01ebnbn | \u2264 1 for each n \u2265 2.\nAs |\u01eb| = 1, triangle inequality gives the proof for part (b).\nFor the proof of part (c), we observe that\n\u2032\n\n|F (z) \u2212 1| =\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=2\n\nnan z\n\nn\u22121\n\n+\u01eb\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nnbn z n\u22121 < 1,\n\nn=1\n\nz \u2208 D.\n\nTherefore, with z = rei\u03b8 for r \u2208 (0, 1) and 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 2\u03c0, the last inequality gives\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u221e\nX\n1\n2\n2\n2 2(n\u22121)\n2\nn (|an | + |bn | )r\n+ |b1 | =\n|F \u2032(rei\u03b8 ) \u2212 1|2 d\u03b8 \u2264 1.\n2\u03c0\n0\nn=2\nLetting r \u2192 1\u2212 , we obtain the inequality\n\u221e\nX\nn2 (|an |2 + |bn |2 ) \u2264 1 \u2212 |b1 |2\nn=2\n\nand the proof is complete.\n\n\u0003\n\n1\nIn [13], under the hypotheses of Lemma 2.1, it was actually shown that f \u2208 CH\n,\nwhere\n1\nCH\n= {f \u2208 SH : Re fz (z) > |fz (z)| in D}.\n2\n1\nClearly, Lemma 2.1 improves this result because of the strict inclusion CH\n$ CH\n.\n\u2032\nLater, in [1], it was also shown that if b1 = g (0) = 0, then the coefficient condition\n\n\fHarmonic Mappings\n\n7\n\n\u22170\n(2.2) ensures that f \u2208 SH\n(see also [16]). In view of Lemma 2.1, the result of [1, 16]\nmay be stated in an improved form.\n\nLemma 2.4.

Let h and g have the form (1.1) with |b1 | < 1\u2212\u03b2 for some \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1),\nand f = h + g.

First we observe that b1 = g \u2032 (0) = 0. The conditions (1.4) implies\nthat the series (1.1) are convergent in the unit disk |z| < 1, and hence, the sum h\nand g are analytic in D. Thus, f = h + g is harmonic in D. Let 0 < r < 1, we let\nfr (z) := r \u22121 f (rz) = r \u22121 h(rz) + r \u22121 g(rz)\nso that fr (z) = hr (z) + gr (z) and\nfr (z) = z +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nan r\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\u22121 n\n\nz +\n\nn=2\n\nn=2\n\nbn r n\u22121z n , z \u2208 D.\n\nBy hypotheses, |an | \u2264 An and |bn | \u2264 Bn for n \u2265 2, where An and Bn are given by\n(1.3).

By Theorem 1.11 with\nc = 4M/\u03c0,\npwe conclude that f is close-to-convex and starlike (because b1 = 0) for\n|z| < 1 \u2212 c/(c + 1) = rS .\nIn particular, f is univalent for |z| < rS and furthermore, we have for |z| = rS ,\n\n(3.2)\n\n|an | + |bn | \u2264\n\n|f (z)| =\n\nz+\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u2265 |z| \u2212\n\u2265 rS \u2212\n\u2265 rS \u2212\n\nand the proof is complete.\n\nan z n + bn z n\n\nn=2\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u0001\n\nan z n + bn z n\n\nn=2\n\u221e\nX\nn=2\n\n\u0001\n\n(|an | + |bn |)rSn\n\n\u221e\n4M X n\nr\n\u03c0 n=2 S\n\n4M rS2\n= RS\n= rS \u2212\n\u03c0 1 \u2212 rS\n\n\u0003\n\n\fHarmonic Mappings\n\n13\n\nReferences\n1.
