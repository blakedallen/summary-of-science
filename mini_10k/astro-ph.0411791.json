Since AGN accretion disks are unstable to selfgravity on parsec scales, star formation in these disks will create young stellar disks,\nsimilar to those recently discovered in our Galactic Center. The disks blend into the\nquasi-spherical star cluster enveloping the AGN on time scales much longer than a\nlikely AGN lifetime. Therefore, the gravitational potential within the radius of the\nblack hole influence is at best axi-symmetric rather than spherically symmetric. Here\nwe show that as a result, a newly formed accretion disk will be warped. For the simplest\ncase of a potential resulting from a thin stellar ring, we calculate the disk precession\nrates, and the time dependent shape. We find that, for a realistic parameter range,\nthe disk becomes strongly warped in few hundred orbital times. We suggest that this,\nand possibly other mechanisms of accretion disk warping, have a direct relevance to\nthe problem of AGN obscuration, masing warped accretion disks, narrow Fe K\u03b1 lines,\netc.\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nObservations show that a significant fraction, perhaps a\nmajority, of AGN of different types are obscured by a\nscreen of a cold dusty matter, thought to be a molecular torus-like structure with a scale between 1 to a\n100 parsec (Antonucci & Miller 1985; Antonucci 1993;\nMaiolino & Rieke 1995; Risaliti, Maiolino, & Salvati 1999;\nSazonov & Revnivtsev 2004; Jaffe et al. 2004). Moreover,\nmany lines of observational evidence suggest that the unobscured AGN have similar torii as well, but we are viewing\nthese AGN at an angle allowing a direct view of their central engines. The orientation-dependent obscuration is thus\nsaid to unify the different AGN classes (Antonucci & Miller\n1985; Antonucci 1993).\nDespite the observational importance, the theory of\nmolecular torii is still in an exploratory state, which is indicative of the difficulty of the problem. Krolik & Begelman\n(1988) (see also Krolik & Begelman 1986) showed that the\nlarge geometrical thickness of the torus and yet its apparently low temperature are consistent only if the torus\nis made of many molecular clouds moving with very high\n>\nrandom velocities (Mach number \u223c\n30). Given that stellar\nfeedback processes appear inefficient to explain these large\nrandom speeds, the authors were \"forced to seek a much\nmore speculative solution: viscous heating of the cloud system due to partially elastic cloud-cloud collisions.\" However,\nuntil now there is no definitive answer (via numerical simulations) on whether clouds colliding at large Mach numbers\nwould behave even partially elastic, or would rather share\nand dump the random velocity component and collapse to\na disk configuration.\n\nWada & Norman (2002) took a point with\nKrolik & Begelman (1988) assertion of the weakness\nof the stellar processes. Considering \"large\", e.g. 100 parsec\ntorii, and via numerical simulations of supernova explosions\nresulting from star formation in a self-gravitating, massive\ndisk, they have shown that large random cold gas velocities\nresult from the interaction of the gas with the supernova\nshells. However as such about 99 % of the gaseous disk in\nthe simulations is consumed in the star formation episode\nrather than being accreted by the black hole. Unless most\nof the stars formed in the disk are later somehow accreted\nonto the SMBH, this mechanism can only work for torii on\nscales much larger than the SMBH gravitational sphere of\ninfluence, Rh , i.e. where the stellar mass is much greater\nthan MBH . It is also not clear whether this mechanism\nwould work for smaller accretion/star formation rates because then supernova explosions become too rare. Finally,\ntime variability of obscuring column depths argues for much\nsmaller radial sizes of the \"torus\", e.g. in the range 0.1 \u2212 10\nparsec (Risaliti, Elvis, & Nicastro 2002).\nHere we would like to emphasize that accretion disks\nin AGN are very unlikely to be planar. There are several\nmechanisms that are capable of producing strong warps. We\nbelieve that such warps have to be an integral part of the\nAGN obscuration puzzle. In particular, we shall describe\nand calculate a disk warping mechanism driven by an axisymmetric gravitational potential.\nThe sequence of events that takes place in an AGN feeding cycle in our model is as following. First of all, a merger\nwith another galaxy or a satellite, or another source of cold\ngas, fills the inner part of the galaxy with plenty of gas. This\ngas will in general have a significant angular momentum ori-\n\n\f2\n\nNayakshin\n\nented practically randomly. The gas will start settling in a\ndisk that is too massive and too cold to be stable against selfgravity (e.g., Paczynski 1978; Shlosman & Begelman 1989;\nCollin & Zahn 1999; Goodman 2003). Stars are formed inside the accretion disk, producing a flat stellar system. This\nlong-lived axi-symmetric (or perhaps also warped) structure\nwill torque any orbit which is not exactly co-planar with it,\nresulting in a precession around the symmetry axis. Now, as\nthe time goes on, the orientation of the angular momentum\nvector of the incoming gas changes, and the newly built disk\nis exposed to the torque from the stellar disk remnant. Different rings of the disk precess at different rates, thus the\ndisk becomes warped.\nWe shall emphasize that existence of these stellar disk\nremnants is hardly a question based on the severe selfgravity problems for the standard accretion disks at large\nradii. The recent observational evidence supports this conclusion too. The best known example of such flat stellar\nsystems is in our Galactic Center (Genzel et al. 2003) where\ntwo young stellar rings are orbiting the SMBH only a tenth\nof a parsec away. The orbital planes of these rings are\noriented at very large angles to the Galactic plane. Such\nflat stellar systems are also being found elsewhere (e.g.,\nKrajnovic & Jaffe 2004).\nIn this paper, we concentrate on the linear gravitational\nwarping effect to investigate its main features. Taking the\nsimplest case of a warp produced by a massive ring, we calculate the gravitational warping torque. Starting from a thin\ntest accretion disk, we calculate its time dependent shape.\nUnder quite realistic assumptions, the disk becomes strongly\nwarped in some 102 \u2212 103 orbital times, i.e. in 105 \u2212 107\nyears. Since the warping is gravitational in nature, gaseous\nand clumpy molecular disks alike are subject to such deformations. We speculate that in the non-linear stage of the\neffect, a clumpy warped disk will form a torus-like structure.\n\n2.1\n\nGravitational torques between two rings\n\nLet us calculate the gravitational torque between two rings\nwith radii R1 and R, inclined at angle \u03b2 with respect to\neach other. We work in two rigid coordinate systems, x, y, z\nand x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 , centers of which are at the SMBH. For convenience, we place the first ring in the z = 0 plane, whereas\nthe second ring is at z \u2032 = 0 plane. Angle \u03b2 is obviously the\nangle between the axes z and z \u2032 . Further, the axes x and x\u2032\nare chosen to coincide with the line of the nodes.\nThe total torque exerted by the second ring on the first\none is\n~\u03c421 = G\u03c31 R1 \u03c3R\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c61\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\nd\u03c6\n\n[~r1 \u00d7 ~r]\n|~r \u2212 ~r1 |3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c31 = M1 /2\u03c0R1 and \u03c3 = M/2\u03c0R, with M1 and M\nbeing the masses of the two rings, respectively. The integration goes over angles \u03c61 and \u03c6 that are azimuthal angles in\nthe respective frames of the rings. From this expression it\nis immediately clear that co-planar rings do not exert any\ntorque on each other, [~r1 \u00d7 ~r] = 0. In addition, if \u03b2 = \u03c0/2,\nthe integral vanishes as well because for each ~r1 the opposites sides of the second ring (e.g. \u03c6 and \u03c6 + \u03c0) make equal\nbut opposing contributions.\nIt is also possible to show that due to symmetry the\ntorque's z-projection vanish. Thus we only have the \u03c421,x =\n\u2212\u03c412,x component, meaning that the angular momentum\nvector of the ring will rotate without changing its magnitude. Also, if M1 \u226b M , then one can neglect warping of the\nfirst ring.\nThe absolute distance between two ring elements with\nthe respective angles \u03c61 and \u03c6 is\n[~r1 \u2212 ~r]2 = R12 + R2 \u2212 2R1 R cos \u03bb ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\ncos \u03bb = cos \u03b2 sin \u03c6 sin \u03c61 + cos \u03c61 cos \u03c6 .\n\n(3)\n\nWithout going into tedious detail, we write the torque expression separating out the leading radial dependence and\nthe integral over angles, which we label I(\u03b4, \u03b2):\n\u03c421,x =\n2\n\nTORQUES IN A LINEAR REGIME\n\nThe basic physics of the effect is very simple and has been\nexplained by e.g., Binney (1992) in his consideration of the\ngalactic warps (most galactic disks are somewhat warped).\nConsider a nearly circular orbit of radius R for a test particle\nin an axi-symmetric potential (e.g. a central point mass plus\na flat disk). Let the axis z to be perpendicular to the plane\nof the disk. The particle makes radial and vertical oscillations with slightly different frequencies, and the difference\nis the precession frequency, \u03c9p . Due to the symmetry, the\nz-projection of the angular momentum of the particle is exactly conserved (see, e.g., \u00a73.2 in Binney & Tremaine 1987).\nThus the angle between the angular momentum of the particle and the z-axis, \u03b2, is a constant. The line of the nodes (the\nline over which the two planes intersect), however, precesses.\nNow consider a \"test-particle\" disk initially in the same\nplane as the circular orbit. The disk is a collection of rings,\ni.e. circular orbits. Since precession rates \u03c9p are different for\ndifferent R, rings turn around the z-axis on unequal angles.\nThe initially flat disk will be warped with time.\n\nGM1 M R1 R\nI(\u03b4, \u03b2) ,\n(R12 + R2 )3/2\n\n(4)\n\nwith\nI(\u03b4, \u03b2) \u2261 sin \u03b2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c61\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6 sin \u03c61 sin \u03c6\n2\u03c0 [1 \u2212 \u03b4 cos \u03bb]3/2\n\n(5)\n\nand\n\u03b4\u2261\n\n2R1 R\n.\nR12 + R2\n\n(6)\n\nTotal angular momentum of the second ring is L =\nM \u03a9K R2 . Recall that Lz = L cos \u03b2 = const, whereas the\n~ in the plane of the first ring (z = 0) precomponent of L\ncesses. We chose it to be initially in the y-direction, so that\nLy (t = 0) = L sin \u03b2 (cf. equation 12 below). The precession\nfrequency for the second ring is then\n\u03c412,x\n\u03c412,x\n=\n,\n(7)\n\u03c9p =\nLy\nM \u03a9K R2 sin \u03b2\nIn general, the integral in equation 5 is calculated\nnumerically, but for \u03b4 \u226a 1 one can decompose [1 \u2212\n\u03b4 cos \u03bb]\u22123/2 \u2248 1 + 3/2\u03b4 cos \u03bb and obtain I(\u03b4, \u03b2) \u2248\n\n\f3\n(3/8)\u03b4 sin 2\u03b2.

The\na maximum at radius Rm at which Rm /R1 =\nmaximum growth rate of the warp is thus\nmax |\u03c9p | \u2243 0.085\u03a9K cos \u03b2\n\nM1\n.\nMBH\n\n(9)\n\nM1 /MBH may be expected on the order of a percent or so\nsince this is when the accretion disks become self-gravitating\n(e.g., Nayakshin & Cuadra 2004), and the resulting stellar\nmass would probably be of that order too. In this case one\nnotices that to produce a sufficiently large warp one has to\nwait for at least \u223c 10\u00d7MBH /M1 \u223c 1000\u03a9\u22121\nK or \u223c 150 orbital\ntimes at the radius of the maximum warp Rm . While this is a\nfairly long time, it is still much shorter than the corresponding disk viscous time (cf., e.g., Fig. 2 in Nayakshin & Cuadra\n(2004)).\nThe assimptotic dependence of precession frequency on\nradius R is\n\u03c9p \u2192 \u2212\n\n3M1\nR3\ncos \u03b2 3 \u03a9K\n4MBH\nR1\n\n\u03c9p \u2192 \u2212\n\nfor R \u226a R1 ,\n\n3M1\nR2\ncos \u03b2 12 \u03a9K\n4MBH\nR\n\nand\n\n(10)\n\nfor R \u226b R1 .\n\n(11)\n\nA thin massive stellar ring would thus only warp a range of\nradii, leaving the portions of the disk much internal and also\nmuch external to it unaffected.\n2.2\n\nTest disk warping\n\nWe now want to calculate the shape of a light non selfgravitating disk warped by a massive ring R1 . The disk is\ntreated as a collection of rings with different radii R and\nnegligible mass. We assume that the mass of the whole disk,\nM , is negligible in comparison with the mass of the ring,\nM \u226a M1 , and that therefore the massive ring's orientation\n(angular momentum) does not change with time.\nIn application to the real disks, it should be remembered\nthat any attempt to warp a disk will be resisted by disk viscous forces (e.g., Bardeen & Petterson 1975) that transfer\nthe angular momentum through the disk. However, we are\ninterested in the outermost regions of AGN accretion disks\nwhere they \"connect\" to the galaxy. On these, a tenth of a\nparsec to 100 parsec scales (the range depends on MBH ),\nthe usual \u03b1-disk viscosity (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) becomes ineffective. The viscous time scale becomes too long\nand the disks are believed to be prone to self-gravity (e.g.,\nPaczynski 1978; Shlosman & Begelman 1989; Collin & Zahn\n1999; Goodman 2003). Therefore we are justified in neglecting the restoring viscous forces. A much more important\neffect will be the restoring force from the self-gravity of the\ndisk that is being warped, but we differ the study of this\nand other non-linear effects to a future paper.\nIt is convenient to work with angle \u03b2, already introduced, and one additional angle, \u03b3. Recall that angle \u03b2 is\nthe local angle of the ring's tilt to the z-axis and it remains\nconstant in the test particle regime. Angle \u03b3 is needed to\n\nintroduce the projections of the unit tilt vector normal to\nthe ring, l(R, t), on the x and y axes (Pringle 1996):\n~l = (cos \u03b3 sin \u03b2, sin \u03b3 sin \u03b2, cos \u03b2) .\n\n(12)\n\nAngle \u03b3 therefore describes the precession of each ring\naround the z-axis. With the chosen coordinate system, at\ntime t = 0, \u03b3 = \u03c0/2 (and we get, in accord with conventions\nof \u00a72.1, Ly (0) = L sin \u03b2, Lx (0) = 0). As each of the disk\nrings precesses,\n\u03b3 = \u03c0/2 + \u03c9p t .\n\n(13)\n\nIt is useful to write the expression for the unit tilt vector in the (x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 ) coordinate system rigidly bound to the\ninitial disk plane:\nly\u2032\n\nlx\u2032 = sin \u03b2 cos \u03b3 ,\n\n(14)\n\n= \u2212 cos \u03b2 sin \u03b2(1 \u2212 sin \u03b3) ,\n\n(15)\n\nlz\u2032 = cos2 \u03b2 + sin2 \u03b2 sin \u03b3 .\n\n(16)\n\nNote that if \u03b2 = 0, lx\u2032 = ly\u2032 = 0, e.g. the rings are never\ntilted with respect to the z = z \u2032 axis, as it should. Also,\nwhen \u03b3 = \u03c0/2, ~l\u2032 indeed coincides with the z \u2032 -axis, i.e. the\ndisk is flat.\nUsing equations 14-16, we can now calculate the shape\nof the warped disk in that system given the function \u03b3(R, t).\nTo accomplish this, one first introduces the azimuthal angle\n\u03c6 on the surface of the ring. The coordinates of the points\non the ring, ~r, are then given by equations 2.2 and 2.3 in\nPringle (1996). The corresponding coordinates in the primed\nsystem of reference are easily obtained by x\u2032 = (~re~x \u2032 ), etc.,\nwhere e~x \u2032 and so on are the unit coordinate vectors of the\nprimed system. The result is:\nx\u2032\n= cos \u03b2 cos \u03b3 sin \u03c6 + sin \u03b3 cos \u03c6 ,\nR\n\n(17)\n\n\u2032\n\ny\n= \u2212 cos \u03b2 cos \u03b3 cos \u03c6 + sin \u03c6(cos2 \u03b2 sin \u03b3 + sin2 \u03b2) ,\nR\nz\u2032\n= \u2212 sin \u03b2 [cos \u03b3 cos \u03c6 + (1 \u2212 sin \u03b3) cos \u03b2 sin \u03c6] .\nR\n2.3\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nAn example\n\nTo illustrate the results, we calculate the precession rates\n\u03c9p (R) for the following case, R1 = 2, M1 = 0.01MBH ,\n\u03b2 = \u03c0/4. The resulting shape of the disk in the original\nun-warped disk plane is plotted in Figure 1. The time is\nin units of \u03a9\u22121\nK at R = 1, i.e. t = 1 corresponds to time\n\u22121/2\n3/2\nyears, where rpc is the distance in units\nt = 1400 rpc M8\nof parsec and M8 = MBH /108 M\u2299 . Note that the warp is\nstrongest around radius R \u223c R1 = 2, as expected. The inner disk is hardly tilted, which is not surprising given that\n\u03c9p (R) \u2192 0 for small R (equation 10). Same is true for the\nouter radii, where the small tilt of the original plane can be\nseen on the edges of the disk (we do not calculate the tilt\nbeyond R = 5.2 and hence the original disk plane is still\nseen on the edges of the Figure).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nObscuration of the central engine in AGN\n\nWe believe that the gravitational disk warping due to nonspherical mass distribution within the SMBH sphere of in-\n\n\f4\n\nNayakshin\n\nFigure 1. Snapshots of the shape of a massless accretion disk warped by a stellar ring of radius R = 2 inclined at angle \u03b2 = \u03c0/4 with\nrespect to the disk. The snapshots are for four different time as indicated on the top of each panel. The time unit is 1/\u03a9K (R = 1) =\n3/2\n\u22121/2\n1400 rpc M8\nyears. At times larger than those used in the Figure, the disk becomes warped so much that, looking from its initially\nnon-warped plane, the plane equation z \u2032 (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) becomes a multiple-valued function for some (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ). In reality non-linear effects will\nlimit the growth of the warp.\n\nfluence is a common occurrence in real AGN. It is hard to see\nwhy AGN disks should always form in one plane and even\nwhy they should be planar when they are born (Phinney\n1989). The time scales for development of strong warps are\nshort or comparable to characteristic AGN lifetimes (which\nare thought to be in the range of 107 \u2212 108 years). We thus\nexpect that the outer edges of the disk will obscure a significant fraction of the sky as seen from the central source\nand hence be directly relevant to the unification schemes of\nAGN (Antonucci 1993).\nFigure 2 shows the warped disk surface from Figure 1\nat different times as seen fromp\nthe origin of coordinates. The\nvertical axis shows cos \u03b8 \u2261 z \u2032 / (x\u2032 )2 + (y \u2032 )2 + (z \u2032 )2 and the\nhorizontal one shows \u03c6 defined previously. The shape of the\ndisk at different times is shown with different colors. At time\nt = 0 the disk is flat and its projection is simply cos \u03b8 = 0\nfor all \u03c6. At later times the rings of the disk near R =\n\nR1 = 2 precess and bulge out of the initial disk plane. With\ntime the fraction of the sky obscured from the central engine\nbecomes greater than a half. In reality non-linear effects and\ninteraction of the disk with AGN winds and radiation, etc.,\nwill become important in shaping the disk for significant\nwarps.\n\n3.2\n\nThe non-linear evolution\n\nIn general, the non-linear stage of the evolution of the system of disks or rings of stars and molecular gas is far from\na thin disk as long as collisions are of minor importance.\nWe have already explored the non-linear evolution of collisionless systems with N-body codes and the results will\nbe reported elsewhere. When two massive disks warp each\nother, mixing occurs when \u03b3 \u2212 \u03c0/2 becomes large, and the\nresulting configuration reminds that of a torus.\n\n\f5\ngalaxy. Compared with the model of Krolik & Begelman\n(1988), large random speeds for the cold gas are not\nrequired in our model. Although the gas may be quite\nhigh up away from the original plane of the disk, the disk\nis locally coherent and thin. High speed elastic collisions\nbetween molecular clouds are thus not needed to explain\nobscuration of AGN in our model.\nThere are also two other mechanisms potentially able\nto produce warped disks at parsec and beyond scales around\nAGN. As mentioned in the X-ray binaries context, accretion\ndisks develop twists and warps due to instabilities driven by\nX-ray heated wind off the disk surface (Schandl & Meyer\n1994). Same can be achieved by the radiation pressure force\nfrom the central source (Pringle 1996). However, it seems\nthat the majority of disks in X-ray binaries are either not\nwarped or warped not strongly enough (Ogilvie & Dubus\n2001) to provide the large obscuration needed for the AGN\nunification schemes. In contrast, the warping mechanism discussed here is not applicable to X-ray binary systems, and\nhence it may be natural that AGN disks are stronger warped\nthan X-ray binary disks on appropriately scaled distances\nfrom the center.\n\n3.3\nFigure 2. The accretion disk surface as seen from the SMBH\nlocation for four different times: t = 100, 400, 800, 3200 for the\nblack, green, red and yellow dots, respectively. Note that at the\nlargest time most of the available solid angle is obscured by the\nstrongly warped disk.\n\nNow, inelastic dissipative collisions between gas clumps\nwill eventually become important. Relaxation of a collisionless N-body system leads to non-circular orbits, and hence\ndifferent disk rings will start to overlap. Collisions should\nthen tend to destroy the random motions and should establish a common disk \"plane\". However, such a disk will normally be warped itself. Therefore inelastic dissipative collisions do not necessarily turn off the obscuration in our\nmodel. Further, if molecular gas clumps are constantly supplied from the outside and come with fluctuating angular\nmomentum, the disk may never arrive in a flat thin configuration (see also Phinney 1989).\nNenkova, Ivezi\u0107, & Elitzur\n(2002)\nand\nRisaliti, Elvis, & Nicastro (2002) convincingly argued\nthat the AGN obscuring medium must not be uniform in\ndensity. This does not contradict our model at all since\nAGN accretion disks on large (e.g. 0.1 pc and beyond)\nscales are self-gravitating unless the accretion rates are tiny\n(e.g., Shlosman & Begelman 1989).\nThe source of warping potential does not have to be\na thin stellar ring or a disk: it may be any non-spherical\ndistribution of stars in the SMBH vicinity that retains a nonzero quadrupole moment; it can also be a second (smaller)\nsuper-massive black hole during a merger of two galaxies.\nBoth the collision-dominated (Krolik & Begelman\n1988)\nand\nthe\nstellar-feedback\ninflated\ntorii\n(Wada & Norman 2002) share a common starting point:\nthe torus is the result of some internal disk physics. If our\ninterpretation applies, AGN torii lend their existence to the\nway in which the cold gas arrives in the central part of the\n\nThe stellar disks in Sgr A\u2217\n\nThe two young stellar disks discovered recently in Sgr A\u2217\npresent a challenge to the usual star formation modes because the gas densities required to avoid tidal shearing are\nmany orders of magnitude larger than the highest densities\nobserved anywhere in the galactic molecular clouds. On the\nother hand, star formation inside a massive accretion disk is\na long expected outcome of the self-gravitational instability\nof such disks (e.g. Paczynski 1978; Shlosman & Begelman\n1989; Collin & Zahn 1999; Goodman 2003). As such, the\nyoung stars in the Sgr A\u2217 star cluster therefore are a first\nexample of star formation in this extreme environment. It\nis very likely that the star formation efficiency and the initial mass function (IMF) are quite different in the immediate AGN vicinity and elsewhere in a galaxy. The \"astroarcheology\" of Sgr A\u2217 can be used to study these issues.\nThe gravitational warping effect discussed in this paper constrains the time-averaged mass of the outer ring,\nMouter , since the moment of its creation, assumed to be\nt = 2 \u00d7 106 years. The inner stellar ring is rather well defined (Genzel et al. 2003), and we thus estimate \u03c9p t for the\ninner ring to be smaller than \u03c0/4. Taking the radius of the\ninner stellar ring to be R = 3\u2032\u2032 \u2243 4 \u00d7 104 RS for the GC\nblack hole, and for the outer, R1 = 5\u2032\u2032 , and using equation\n8 with cos \u03b2 = 1/4, one obtains Mouter < 105 M\u2299 . Preliminary numerical N-body simulations show this limit may be\neven smaller.\n\n3.4\n\nOther implications for AGN\n\nThere are clearly other observational implications of gravitationally warped disks. For example, Narrow Fe K\u03b1 lines,\nobserved in many Seyfert galaxies, can be explained with Xray reflection off such warped cold disks. In addition, warped\ndisks will yield different coherent paths for maser amplification than flat disks do, which may be a part of the explanation for the complexity of the observed AGN maser emission.\n\n\f6\n4\n\nNayakshin\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe argued that clumpy self-gravitating accretion disks in\nAGN are generically strongly warped. We believe such warping should be an integral part of the explanation for the\nAGN unification schemes. Our model provides arguably the\neasiest way to obscure the central engine without the need\nto lift cold gas clouds off the disk plane high up via elastic\ncollisions, supernova explosions or winds.\n\n5\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author thanks Jorge Cuadra and Walter Dehnen for\ntheir help with numerical simulations that motivated this\nsemi-analytical paper, and for very useful discussions.
