For several pairs of an input class and\na covering class we determine exactly the maximum ordinary, local, and folded covering\nnumber of an input graph with respect to that covering class.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGraph covering is one of the most classical topics in graph theory. In 1891, in one of the first\npurely graph-theoretical papers, Petersen [47] showed that any 2r-regular graph can be covered\nwith r sets of vertex disjoint cycles. A survey on covering problems by Beineke [11] appeared in\n1969. Graph covering is a lively field with deep ramifications \u2013 over the last decades as well as\ntoday [2, 3, 25, 30, 31, 45]. This is supported through the course of this paper by many references\nto recent works of different authors.\nIn every graph covering problem one is given an input graph H, a covering class G, and\na notion of how to cover H with one or several graphs from G. One is then interested in Gcoverings of H that are in some sense simple, or well structured; the most prevalent measure of\nsimplicity being the number of graphs from G needed to cover the edges of H.\nThe main goal of this paper is to introduce the following three parameters, each of which\nrepresents how well H can be covered with respect to G in a different way:\nThe global covering number, or simply covering number, is the most classical one. It is\nthe smallest number of graphs from G needed to cover the edges of H without covering nonedges of H. All kinds of arboricities, e.g. star [4], caterpillar [24], linear [3], pseudo [48], and\nordinary [46] arboricity of a graph are global covering numbers, where the covering class is\nthe class of star forests, caterpillar forests, linear forests, pseudoforests, and ordinary forests,\nrespectively. Other global covering numbers are the planar and outerplanar thickness [11, 45]\nand the track number [28] of a graph. Here, the covering classes are planar, outerplanar, and\ninterval graphs, respectively.\n\u2217\nAix-Marseille\nUniversit\u00e9,\nCNRS,\nLIF\nUMR\n7279,\n13288,\nMarseille,\nemail: kolja.knauer@lif.univ-mrs.fr\n\u2020\nKarlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany. email: torsten.ueckerdt@kit.edu\n\n1\n\nFrance.\n\n\fIn the local covering number of H with covering class G one also tries to cover the edges of H\nwith graphs from G but now minimizes the largest number of graphs in the covering containing\na common vertex of H. We are aware of only two local covering numbers in the literature: The\nbipartite degree introduced by Fishburn and Hammer [21] is the local covering number where\nthe covering class is the class of complete bipartite graphs. It was rediscovered by Dong and\nLiu [16] as the local biclique cover number, and recently it has been studied in comparison with\nits global variant by Pinto [49]. The local clique cover number is another local covering number,\nwhere the covering class is the class of complete graphs. It was studied by Skums, Suzdal, and\nTyshkevich [55] and by Javadi, Maleki, and Omoomi [37].\nFinally, the folded covering number underlies a different, but related, concept of covering.\nHere, one looks for a graph in G which has H as homomorphic image and one minimizes the\nsize of the largest preimage of a vertex of H. Equivalently, one splits every vertex of H into a\nindependent set such that the size of the largest such independent set is minimized, distributing\nthe incident edges to the new vertices, such that the result is a graph from G. The folded covering\nnumber has been investigated using interval graphs and planar graphs as covering class. In the\nformer case the folded covering number is known as the interval number [32], in the latter case\nas the splitting-number [36].\nWhile some covering numbers, like arboricities, are of mainly theoretical interest, others,\nlike thickness, interval number, and track number, have wide applications in VLSI design [1],\nnetwork design [50], scheduling and resource allocation [9, 13], and bioinformatics [38, 40]. The\nthree covering numbers presented here not only unify some notions in the literature, they as well\nseem interesting in their own right and may provide new approaches to attack classical open\nproblems.\nstar forests\ng\nl=f\nouterplanar\nplanar\nbipartite\nplanar\n\n3 [29]\n\n3\n\ncaterpillar forests\nl\ng\nf\n3 [42]\n\n3\n\n3\n\ng\n2\n\ninterval graphs\nl\n\nf\n\n[42]\n\n2\n\n2\n\n[52]\n\n4\n\n(C18)\n\n3\n\n(C18)\n\n4\n\n[23]\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n[52]\n\n5\n\n[5, 29]\n\n4\n\n(C18)\n\n4\n\n[23]\n\n4\n\n4 [52]\nk+1\n\n4 [24]\nk+1\n\n?\n\n3\n\n[52]\n\n(T17)\n\n(T16)\nk+1\n\nstw \u2264 k\n\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\ntw \u2264 k\ndgn \u2264 k\n\nk+1 [15, 17]\n2 k [6]\n\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\n2k\n\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\nk+1\n\n(C10)\n\n2k\n\n(T12)\n\nk\n\n(T14)\nk+1\nk+1\n\nk\n\n(T15)\n\nk+1\n\n(T15)\n\nk+1\n\nTable 1: Overview of results.\nIn this paper we moreover present new lower and upper bounds for several covering numbers.\nIn the new results, the covering classes are: interval graphs, star forests, linear forests, and\ncaterpillar forests. The input classes are: graphs of bounded degeneracy, bounded tree-width or\nbounded simple tree-width, as well as outerplanar, planar bipartite, planar, and regular graphs.\nNot all pairs of these input classes with these covering classes are given new bounds. We provide\nan overview over some of our new results in Table 1. Each row of the table corresponds to an\ninput class H , each column to a covering class G. Every cell contains the maximum covering\nnumber among all graphs H \u2208 H with respect to the covering class G, where the columns labeled\ng, l, f stand for the global, local, and folded covering number, respectively. Grey entries follow\nby Proposition 4 from other stronger results in the table. Letters T and C stand for Theorem\nand Corollary in the present paper, respectively. Indeed all the entries except the ' ?' in Table 1\nare exact, with matching upper and lower bounds. Note that besides results we prove as new\ntheorems as indicated, many values in the table (written in gray) follow from the point of view\noffered by our general approach (Proposition 4).\nThis paper is structured as follows: In order to give a motivating example before the general\n2\n\n\fdefinition, we start by discussing in Section 2 the linear arboricity and its local and folded\nvariants. In Section 3 the three covering numbers are formally introduced and some general\nproperties are established. In Section 4 we introduce the covering classes star forests, caterpillar\nforests, and interval graphs, and in Section 5 we present our results claimed in Table 1. In\nSection 6 we briefly discuss the computational complexity of some covering numbers, giving\na polynomial-time algorithm for the local star arboricity. Moreover, we discuss by how much\nglobal, local and folded covering numbers can differ.\nFor the entire paper we assume all graphs to be simple without loops nor multiple edges.\nNotions used but not introduced can be found in any standard graph theory book; such as [57].\n\n2\n\nGlobal, Local, and Folded Linear Arboricity\n\nWe give the general definitions of covers and covering numbers in Section 3 below. In this section\nwe motivate and illustrate these concepts on the basis of one fixed covering class: the class L\nof linear forests, which are the disjoint unions of paths. We want to cover an input graph H\nby several linear forests L1 , . . . , Lk \u2208 L. That is, every edge e \u2208 E(H) is contained in at least1\none LS\ni and no non-edge of H is contained in any Li . When H is covered by L1 , . . . , Lk we write\nH = i\u2208[k] Li .\nS\nThe linear arboricity of H, denoted by la(H), is the minimum k such that H = i\u2208[k] Li\nand Li \u2208l L form i \u2208 [k]. One easily sees that every graph H lof maximum\ndegree \u2206(H) has\nm\n\u2206(H)+1\n\u2206(H)\n, and every \u2206(H)-regular graph H has la(H) \u2265\n. In 1980, Akiyama et\nla(H) \u2265\n2\n2\nal. [3] stated the Linear Arboricity Conjecture (LAC).\narboricity of any\nl It says\nm that\nl the linear\nm\n\u2206(H)\n\u2206(H)+1\nsimple graph H of maximum degree \u2206(H) is either\nor\n. LAC was confirmed\n2\n2\nfor planar graphs by Wu and Wu [59, 60] and asymptotically for general graphs by Alon and\nSpencer l\n[7]. The mgeneral conjecture remains open. The best-known general upper bound for\n, due to Guldan [27].\nla(H) is 3\u2206(H)+2\n5\nWeSdefine the local linear arboricity of H, denoted by lal (H), as the minimum j such that\nH = i\u2208[k] Li for some k and every vertex v in H is contained in at most j different Li .\nm\nl\n, and if H is \u2206(H)-regular, then\nAgain, if H has maximum degree \u2206(H), then lal (H) \u2265 \u2206(H)\n2\nl\nm\nlal (H) \u2265 \u2206(H)+1\n. Note that lal (H) is at most la(H), and hence the following statement must\n2\nnecessarily hold for LAC to be true.\nConjecture 1. Local Linear Arboricity Conjecture (LLAC):\nl\nm Thel local linear\nm arboricity of any\n\u2206(H)\n\u2206(H)+1\nsimple graph with H maximum degree \u2206(H) is either\nor\n.\n2\n2\nObservation 2. To prove LAC or LLAC it suffices to consider regular graphs of odd degree:\nRegularity is obtained by considering a \u2206(H)-regular supergraph of H. If \u2206(H) is even, say\n\u2206(H) = 2k, one can find a spanning linear forest Lk+1 in H [27], remove it from the graph, and\nextend Lk+1 by a cover L1 , . . . , Lk in the remaining graph of maximum degree \u2206(H)\u22121 = 2k\u22121.\nS\nIf H is regular with odd degree, then LLAC states that H = i\u2208[k] Li with every vertex\nbeinglan endpoint\nof exactly one path. LAC additionally requires that the paths can be colored\nm\n\u2206(H)\ncolors such that no two paths that share a vertex receive the same color. We will\nwith\n2\nsee in later sections that sometimes the coloring is the crucial and difficult task.\nNext we propose a second way to cover the input graph H with linear forests. A walk in H is\na sequence of consecutively incident edges of H of the form {v1 v2 , v2 v3 , . . . , vk\u22121 vk } forSv1 , . . . vk\nbeing vertices of H. As before, a set W1 , . . . , Wk of walks covers H, denoted by H = i\u2208[k] Wi ,\nif the edge-set E of H is the union of the edge-sets of the walks. We are now interested in how\noften a vertex v in H appears in the walks W1 , . . . , Wk in total. The folded linear arboricity\n1\nSince linear forests are closed under taking subgraphs, we can indeed assume that e \u2208 Li for exactly one\ni \u2208 [k].\n\n3\n\n\fS\nof H, denoted by laf (H), is the minimum j such that H = i\u2208[k] Wi and every vertex v in H\nappears atl mostmj times in the walks W1 , . . . , Wk . Again iflH has maximum\ndegree \u2206(H) then\nm\n\u2206(H)+1\n\u2206(H)\n, and if H is \u2206(H)-regular then laf (H) \u2265\n. Clearly, laf (H) \u2264 lal (H).\nlaf (H) \u2265\n2\n2\nThe next theorem follows directly from a short proof of West [56] of a result previously published\nby Griggs and West [26] (where it is stated in terms of the interval number i(H)). It is a\nweakening of LLAC above.\nm l\nm\nl\n\u2206(H)+1\n,\n}.\nTheorem 3. If H has maximum degree \u2206(H) then laf (H) \u2208 { \u2206(H)\n2\n2\nProof. Add a vertex x to H and connect it to every vertex in H of odd degree. Each component\nof the resulting graph is Eulerian. Consider any Eulerian tour in H \u222a x (or H) and split it into\nshorter walks by removing x from it.\n\n3\n\nCovers and Covering Numbers\n\nIn this section we formalize the concepts from Section 2 with respect to general covering and\ninput classes and obtain some general inequalities. The notation we introduce is convenient for\nmaking our generalized approach as transparent as possible. When treating concrete covering\nclasses, for which covering numbers already have an established notation in the literature later\non in the paper, we will use the latter in order to make results more accessible to readers already\nfamiliar with the parameters.\nA homomorphism from a graph G to a graph H is a map \u03c6 : V (G) \u2192 V (H) such that\nvw \u2208 E(G) implies \u03c6(v)\u03c6(w) \u2208 E(H). We call a homomorphism edge-surjective if for all\nv \u2032 w\u2032 \u2208 E(H) there exists vw \u2208 E(G) such that \u03c6(v) = v \u2032 and \u03c6(w) = w\u2032 . For an input\ngraph H and a covering class G, we define a G-cover of H as an edge-surjective homomorphism\n* 2 \u222a* * * * \u222aG\n* k \u2192 H, where Gi \u2208 G for i \u2208 [k] and \u222a* denotes the vertex disjoint union.\n\u03c6 : G1 \u222aG\nThe size of a cover is the number of covering graphs in the disjoint union. A cover \u03c6 is called\ninjective if \u03c6|Gi , that is, \u03c6 restricted to Gi , is injective for every i \u2208 [k].\nDefinition 1. For a covering class G and an input graph H define the (global) covering number\nG\nG\nG\ncg (H), the local covering number cl (H), and the folded covering number cf (H) as follows:\nG\n\ncg (H) = min {size of \u03c6 : \u03c6 is an injective G-cover of H}\n\b\nG\ncl (H) = min maxv\u2208V (H) |\u03c6\u22121 (v)| : \u03c6 is an injective G-cover of H\n\b\nG\ncf (H) = min maxv\u2208V (H) |\u03c6\u22121 (v)| : \u03c6 is a G-cover of H having size 1\nG\n\nG\n\nG\n\nLet us rephrase cg (H), cl (H), and cf (H). The covering number is the minimum number of\ngraphs in G needed to cover H exactly, where covering exactly means identifying subgraphs in\nH that are covering graphs, such that every edge of H is contained in some covering graph. In\nthe local covering number the number of covering graphs is not restricted; instead the number\nof covering graphs at every vertex should be small. We will see later that these two numbers\ncan differ significantly. The folded covering number is the minimum k such that every vertex v\nof H can be split into at most k vertices, distributing the incident edges at v arbitrarily (even\nrepeatedly) among them, such that the resulting graph belongs to G. The splitting corresponds\nto representing the vertex by the set of its preimages under the edge-surjective homomorphism\n\u03c6.\nOne is often interested in the maximum or minimum value of a graph parameter on a class\nof input graphs.\nn For i \u2208 {g, l,\nof }, a covering class G, and an input graph class H , we define\nG\nG\nci (H ) = sup ci (H) : H \u2208 H . We close this section with a list of inequalities, most of which\nare elementary applications of Definition 1 and homomorphisms.\nProposition 4. For covering classes G, G \u2032 , input classes H , H \u2032 and any input graph H we have\nthe following:\n4\n\n\fG\n\nG\n\nG\n\nG\n\n(i) cg (H) \u2265 cl (H), and if G is closed under disjoint union, then cl (H) \u2265 cf (H).\n(ii) If G is closed under merging non-adjacent vertices within connected components (and afterwards deleting multiple edges) and restriction to maximal connected components, then\nG\nG\ncl (H) \u2264 cf (H).\nG\n\nG\n\n(iii) If H \u2286 H \u2032 , then ci (H ) \u2264 ci (H \u2032 ) for i \u2208 {g, l, f }.\n(iv) If HG and HG \u2032 denote the set of subgraphs of H that are homomorphic images of graphs\nG\n\nG\u2032\n\nin G and G \u2032 , respectively, then HG \u2286 HG \u2032 implies ci (H) \u2265 ci (H) for i \u2208 {g, l, f }. This\nholds in particular when G \u2286 G \u2032 .\nG\n\nG\u2032\n\n(v) If H\u0304 denotes the set of all subgraphs of H and we have G \u2229H\u0304 \u2286 G \u2032 \u2229H\u0304, then ci (H) \u2265 ci (H)\nfor i \u2208 {g, l}.\nProof. The first inequality in (i) follows from the definition, the second one comes by viewing\n* 2 \u222a* * * * \u222aG\n* k as a G-cover of size 1.\nan injective cover G1 \u222aG\nG\nTo see (ii), let \u03c6 : G \u2192 H be a G-cover of H of size 1 witnessing cf (H). Now for every v \u2208 H\nand a component G\u2032 of G merge all \u03c6\u22121 (v) \u2229 V (G\u2032 ) into one vertex (and delete multiple edges).\nSince H has no loops, the merging process creates no loops. Doing this for all components of G\ne \u2208 G with homomorphism \u03c6\nyields a new covering graph G\ne being injective on each component.\n\u22121\n\u22121\nClearly, |\u03c6\ne (v)| \u2264 |\u03c6 (v)|.\nClaims (iii) and (iv) follow immediately from the definition. To see (v) note that it follows\nsimilarly as (iv), because G \u2229 H\u0304 and G \u2032 \u2229 H\u0304 are the subgraphs of H that arise as images of\ninjective covers.\nRemark 5. Within the scope of this paper we only consider covering classes that are closed\nunder disjoint union even without explicitly saying so. For example, when considering stars\nor complete graphs as covering graphs, we actually mean star forests and disjoint unions of\ncomplete graphs, respectively. If the covering class G is closed under disjoint union, then the\nG\nrestriction to covers of size 1 in the definition of cf is unnecessary.\nIt is still interesting to consider covering classes that are not closed under disjoint union.\nHaj\u00f3s' Conjecture [43] states that the edges of any n-vertex Eulerian graph H may be partitioned\ninto \u230a n2 \u230b cycles. Haj\u00f3s' Conjecture being widely open, one may consider coverings with cycles.\nWhen C \u2032 denotes the class of all simple cycles and H is an n-vertex Eulerian graph, Fan [19]\n\u2032\nproved cCg (H) \u2264 \u230a n\u22121\n2 \u230b.\nExample\nIn order to illustrate the notions introduced above, consider the covering class C of disjoint\nunions of cycles. As input graph H we take the Petersen graph. See Figure 1 where we have\nfrom left to right: A global cover with three unions of cycles, a local cover of size five with at\nmost three cycles at each vertex, and a folded cover with two preimages per vertex. Note that\nthe local cover does not yield an optimal global cover.\nProposition 6. For the Petersen graph, we have 3 = cCg (H) = cCl (H) > cCf (H) = 2.\nProof. All witnesses for the upper bounds are shown in Figure 1. Clearly, cCf (H) \u2265 2 since\notherwise H would have to be a disjoint union of cycles. Now suppose, cCl (H) = 2. Since H is\ncubic, at each vertex there is exactly one edge contained in two cycles of the covering. Thus,\nthese edges form a perfect matching M of H. Moreover, all cycles involved in the cover are\nalternating cycles with respect to M . In particular they are all even and of length 6 or 8 (as\nthis graph is not Hamiltonian there is no 10-cycle). Since M is covered twice and the remaining\nedges of H once, the sum of sizes of cycles in the cover is 20, which can be obtained only as\n6 + 6 + 8. In particular, a 6-cycle C must be involved. Now M restricted to H\\V (C) is still a\nperfect matching, but H\\V (C) is a claw.\n5\n\n\fFigure 1: Coverings of the Petersen graph by disjoint unions of cycles.\n\n4\n\nCovering Classes\n\nIn this section we introduce the covering classes and covering numbers corresponding to the\ncolumns of Table 1. We also include some known results and general observations.\n\n4.1\n\nForests and Pseudoforests\n\nNash-Williamsl [46] showed\nthat the minimum number of forests needed to cover the edges of H\nm\n|E[S]|\nis maxS\u2286V (H) |S|\u22121 , where E[S] denotes the set of edges in the subgraph induced by S.. This\nvalue, denoted by a(H), is now usually called the arboricity of H, see Beineke [11] for an early\nG\nappearance of this name. Clearly, a(H) = cg (H), where G is the class of forests.\nA pseudoforest is a graph with at most one cycle per component and the pseudoarboricity\np(H) is the minimum number of pseudoforests needed to cover the edges of H. Thus, p(H) =\nG\ncg (H), where G is the class of pseudoforests. Results of Picard and Queyranne [48] and Frank\nand Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s [22] yield the following lemma.\nLemma 7 ( [22, 48]). The pseudoarboricity p(H) of a graph H equals the minimumlover all\nm\norientations of H of the maximum out-degree of H. Furthermore, p(H) = maxS\u2286V (H) |E[S]|\n.\n|S|\nUsing a(H) = maxS\u2286V (H)\na(H) \u2264 p(H) + 1.\n\nl\n\n|E[S]|\n|S|\u22121\n\nm\n\n, one immediate consequence of Lemma 7 is p(H) \u2264\n\nTheorem 8. For every graph, the values of global, local, and folded (pseudo)arboricity coincide.\nProof. Take a folded covering \u03c6 of H with a (pseudo)forest, such that for every v \u2208 H we\nhave |\u03c6\u22121 (v)| \u2264 c. Since (pseudo)forests are closed under taking induced subgraphs, this in\nparticular yields a covering for every induced subgraph H[S] such that every vertex is covered\nat most c times. Now, focusing on pseudoforests, we know that the subgraph of the covering\nm\nl\n.\ngraph induced by \u03c6\u22121 (S) has at most c|S| edges, and therefore c|S| \u2265 |E[S]|, i.e., c \u2265 |E[S]|\n|S|\nl\nm\nNow by Lemma 7, we have p(H) = maxS\u2286V (H) |E[S]|\nyielding the result for folded coverings.\n|S|\nNow, Proposition 4(i) gives the result for the\nl local mcovering number.\nAlong the same lines one obtains c \u2265 |E[S]|+1\nwhen c is the number of times a vertex is\n|S|\nm l\nm\nl\n|E[S]|\n=\ncovered in a forest-cover of H. It is then easy to compute |E[S]|+1\n|S|\n|S|\u22121 , since |E[S]| \u2264\n\u0001\n|S|\n2 . The result follows as in the case of pseudoarboricity.\n\n4.2\n\nStar Forests\n\nThe star arboricity sa(H) of a graph H, introduced by Akiyama and Kano [4], is the minimum\nnumber of star forests (forests without paths of length 3) into which the edge-set of H can be\npartitioned. In particular, if S denotes the class of star forests, then sa(H) = cSg (H). The star\n6\n\n\farboricity has been a frequent subject of research. It is known that outerplanar and planar\ngraphs have star arboricity at most 3 and 5, respectively; see Hakimi et al. [29]. That this is\nbest possible was shown by Algor and Alon [5]. Alon et al. [6] showed that sa(H) \u2264 2a(H) is a\ntight upper bound.\nSince merging non-adjacent vertices in a star and omitting double edges yields again a star,\nlocal and folded star arboricity coincide, by Proposition 4 (ii). Here, we show that in contrast\nto the global star arboricity, the local star arboricity, denoted by sal (H), fits nicely into the\ninequalities relating arboricity and pseudoarboricity from Section 4.1.\nTheorem 9. For any graph H, we have p(H) \u2264 a(H) \u2264 sal (H) \u2264 p(H) + 1, where any\ninequality can be strict. Moreover, sal (H) = p(H) if and only if H has an orientation with\nmaximum out-degree p(H) in which this outdegree occurs only at vertices of degree p(H).\nProof. Every cover of H with respect to stars can be transformed into an orientation of H by\norienting every edge towards the center of the corresponding star. If every vertex is contained in\nat most sal (H) stars, then the orientation has maximum out-degree at most sal (H). Lemma 7\nthen gives p(H) \u2264 sal (H).\nIn the same way, every orientation can be transferred into a cover with respect to stars by\ntaking at every vertex the star of its incoming edges. If the orientation has maximum out-degree\np(H), then each vertex is contained in no more than p(H) + 1 stars, i.e., sal (H) \u2264 p(H) + 1.\nMoreover, the maximum out-degree is sal (H) if and only if for every vertex v lying in sal (H)\nstars with centers different from v there is no star with center v. Equivalently, sal (H) = p(H)\nif and only if the maximum out-degree p(H) is attained only at vertices of degree p(H).\nIf sal (H) = p(H) + 1, then a(H) \u2264 sal (H) follows from a(H) \u2264 p(H) \u2212 1. When sal (H) =\np(H), there is an orientation with maximum out-degree p(H) attained only at vertices with\ndegree p(H). Removing these vertices, we obtain a graph H \u2032 with p(H \u2032 ) \u2264 p(H)\u22121, in particular\na(H \u2032 ) \u2264 p(H). We reinsert the vertices of degree p(H) putting each incident edge into a\ndifferent one of the p(H) forests that partition H \u2032 . We obtain a cover of H with p(H) forests,\nso a(H) \u2264 p(H) = sal (H).\nFinally, we show that each inequality can be strict: First k = p(H) < a(H) holds for every\n2k-regular graph H, due to the number of edges of the covering graphs. Second, we claim that\nk = p(H) = sal (H) holds\nm bipartite graph Kk,n with n large enough. Indeed,\nm complete\nl\nl for the\n\nkn\n= k, and taking all maximal stars with centers in the\n= k+n\np(Kk,n ) = maxS\u2286V (Kk,n ) |E[S]|\n|S|\nsmaller class of the bipartition yields sal (Kk,n ) \u2264 k.\nIt remains to present a graph H with k = a(H) < sal (H). We take H to be the k-dimensional\ngrid of size m. That is, V (H) = [m]k , and there is an edge joining vertices v and w if and only\nif they differ in exactly one coordinate and differ there by 1. It is straightforward to compute\nthat H has (m \u2212 1)mk\u22121 k edges. Observing that H itself is a densest induced subgraph, the\nformulas for arboricity and pseudoarboricity give a(H) = p(H) = k for large enough m. Also,\na(H) = sal (H) implies p(H) = sal (H). Hence, as proved above, H has an orientation with\nmaximum out-degree k, which furthermore is only attained at vertices of degree k. However,\nH has only 2k vertices of degree k. If all other vertices have outdegree at most k \u2212 1, then H\nhas at most 2k k + (mk \u2212 2k )(k \u2212 1) edges. Choosing m > 2k + k yields a contradiction to the\nnumber of edges of H calculated above.\n\nWe will derive from Theorem 9 tight upper bounds for the local star arboricity in Section 5,\nas well as a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the local star arboricity in Section 6.\n\n4.3\n4.3.1\n\nOther Covering Classes\nCaterpillar Forests\n\nA graph parameter related to the star arboricity is the caterpillar arboricity ca(H) of H. A\ncaterpillar is a tree in which all non-leaf vertices form a path, called the spine. The caterpillar\narboricity is the minimum number of caterpillar forests into which the edge-set of H can be\n7\n\n\fpartitioned. It has mainly been considered for outerplanar graphs (Kostochka and West [42]),\nand for planar graphs (Gon\u00e7alves and Ochem [23, 24]).\n4.3.2\n\nInterval Graphs\n\nThe class I of interval graphs has already been considered in many ways and remains present\nin today's literature. Interval graphs have been generalized to intersection graphs of systems\nof intervals by several groups of people: Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s and West [28] proposed the I-covering and\nintroduced the corresponding global covering number called the track number, denoted by t(H),\ni.e., t(H) = cIg (H). It has been shown that outerplanar and planar graphs have track number\nat most 2 [42] and 4 [24], respectively. Already in 1979, Harary and Trotter [32] introduced the\nfolded I-covering number, called the interval number, denoted by i(H), i.e., i(H) = cIf (H). It\nis known that trees have interval number at most 2 [32]. Also, outerplanar and planar graphs\nhave interval number at most 2 and 3, respectively, see Scheinermann and West [52]. All these\nbounds are tight.\nThe local track number tl (H) := cIl (H) is a natural variation of i(H) and t(H), which to our\nknowledge has not been considered so far.\n\n5\n\nResults\n\nIn this section we present all the new results displayed in Table 1. We proceed input class by\ninput class.\n\n5.1\n\nBounded Degeneracy\n\nThe degeneracy dgn(H) of a graph H is the minimum of the maximum out-degree over all acyclic\norientations of H. It is a classical measure for the sparsity of H. By Lemma 7 and the definition\nwe have p(H) \u2264 a(H) \u2264 dgn(H). Thus, the next corollary follows directly from Theorem 9.\nCorollary 10. For every H we have sal (H) \u2264 dgn(H) + 1.\nLet I be the class of interval graphs and Ca be the class of caterpillar forests, i.e., the class of\nbipartite interval graphs. Since homomorphisms the image of a homomorphism has chromatic\nnumber at least as large as its preimage, the chromatic number of an interval graph G that has\na bipartite homomorphic image is at most two. Thus, G is a caterpillar forest. Therefore, when\nG is bipartite, the set of all homomorphic images of caterpillar forests in G coincides with the\nset of all homomorphic images of interval graphs in G. Thus, by Proposition 4 (iv) we have\ncIi (H) = cCa\ni (H) for i \u2208 {g, l, f } for every bipartite graph H. In particular, if H is bipartite\nthen t(H) = ca(H) and i(H) = caf (H). In the remainder of this section we present graphs\nwith high (folded) caterpillar arboricity. Since all these graphs are bipartite, we obtain lower\nbounds on the track number and interval number of those graphs. Indeed in all constructions\nwe define a supergraph H of the complete bipartite graph Km,n . The track number\nand\nm interval\nl\nmn\n[28] and\nnumber of Km,n have already been determined: t(Km,n ) = ca(Km,n ) = m+n\u22121\nl\nm\ni(Km,n ) = caf (Km,n ) = mn+1\n[32].\nm+n\nIn order to formulate the following lemma, we need to introduce one more notion. For a cover\n* k with Gi \u2208 G and a subgraph H \u2032 of H, we define the restriction of \u03c6 to H \u2032\n\u03c6 of H by G1 \u222a* . . . \u222aG\n\u2032\n* \u2032k , where G\u2032i comes from Gi by deleting {e \u2208 E(Gi ) : \u03c6(e) \u2208\n/ H \u2032}\nas a cover \u03c8 of H by G\u20321 \u222a* . . . \u222aG\nand then by removing isolated vertices. The resulting mapping \u03c8 is the restriction of \u03c6 to\n* \u2032k . If G is closed under taking subgraphs, then \u03c8 is also a G-cover. Note that while\nG\u20321 \u222a* . . . \u222aG\nrestriction of a function normally means its specification on a subset of the domain, here we are\nrestricting the image, which turn induces a restriction of the domain.\nTo increase readability we refer to the classes of size m and n in the bipartition of Km,n by\nA and B, respectively.\n\n8\n\n\fLemma 11. Let H be a graph with an induced Km,n and \u03c6 be a Ca-cover of H with s =\nmax{|\u03c6\u22121 (a)| : a \u2208 A}. If \u03c8 is the restriction of \u03c6 to the subgraph H \u2032 of H after removing all\nedges in Km,n , then there are at least n \u2212 2sm vertices b \u2208 B such that |\u03c8 \u22121 (b)| \u2264 |\u03c6\u22121 (b)| \u2212 m.\n* k . Denote by s\u2032 the\nProof. Every a \u2208 A is the image of at most s vertices among C1 \u222a* . . . \u222aC\n\u22121\nnumber of vertices in \u03c6 (a) that are incident to two spine-edges and by s\u2032\u2032 the number of\nvertices in \u03c6\u22121 (a) that are leaves. Clearly, s\u2032 + s\u2032\u2032 \u2264 s. Moreover, at most 2s\u2032 + s\u2032\u2032 edges incident\nto a are covered by spine-edges or edges whose degree 1 vertex is mapped to a. Therefore, at\nleast n \u2212 2s edges at a have to be covered under \u03c6 by a non-spine edge with a vertex b being\nthe image of a leaf. Thus, for at least n \u2212 2sm vertices b \u2208 B this is the case with respect to\nevery a \u2208 A.\nNow if e = ab is covered by some edge in Ci with b being a leaf, then in the restriction of \u03c6\nto H \\ e the number of preimages of b is one less than in \u03c6. This concludes the proof.\nTheorem 12. For k \u2265 1 there is a bipartite graph H such that\n2dgn(H) \u2264 2k \u2264 ca(H) = t(H).\nProof. To construct H, begin with a copy of Kk,n having |A| = k and |B| = n with n >\n\u0001\n2\n(k \u2212 1) 2k\u22121\nk\u22121 + 2k(2k \u2212 1). For each k-subset S of B, add (k \u2212 1) + 1 new vertices BS with\nneighborhood S. The resulting graph H is bipartite with every vertex in A and BS for any S\nhaving degree k, so dgn(H) = k.\nNow consider an injective Ca-cover \u03c6 of H and its restriction \u03c8 to the subgraph of H after\nremoving all edges in Kk,n . Assume for the sake of contradiction that the size s of \u03c6 is at most\n2k \u22121, i.e., max{|\u03c6\u22121 (v)| : v \u2208 V (H)}\u0001 = s \u2264 2k \u22121. Then by Lemma 11, there is a set W \u2282 B of\n\u22121\n\u22121\nat least n \u2212 2(2k \u2212 1)k > (k \u2212 1) 2k\u22121\nk\u22121 vertices such that |\u03c8 (b)| \u2264 |\u03c6 (b)| \u2212 k \u2264 s \u2212 k \u2264 k \u2212 1\nfor every b \u2208 W . In other words, every b \u2208 W has a\u0001 preimage under \u03c8 in at most k \u2212 1 of the\n2k \u2212 1 caterpillar forests. Since |W | > (k \u2212 1) 2k\u22121\nk\u22121 , there is a k-set S in W whose preimages\nare contained in at most k \u2212 1 caterpillar forests.\nThis implies that \u03c8 restricted to H[S \u222a BS ] is an injective Ca-cover of Kk,(k\u22121)2 +1 of size at\nm\nl\n2 +k\n= k, due to [10].\nmost k \u2212 1, which is impossible since ca(Kk,(k\u22121)2 +1 ) = k(k\u22121)\n2\nk+(k\u22121)\n\n5.2\n\nBounded (Simple) Tree-width\n\nA k-tree is a graph that can be constructed starting with a (k + 1)-clique and in every step\nattaching a new vertex to a k-clique of the already constructed graph. We use the term stacking\nfor this kind of attaching. The tree-width tw(H) of a graph H is the minimum k such that H is\na partial k-tree, i.e., H is a subgraph of some k-tree [51].\nWe consider a variation of tree-width, called simple tree-width. A simple k-tree is a k-tree\nwith the extra requirement that there is a construction sequence in which no two vertices are\nstacked onto the same k-clique. Now, the simple tree-width stw(H) of H is the minimum k such\nthat H is a partial simple k-tree, i.e., H is a subgraph of some simple k-tree.\nFor a graph H with stw(H) = k or tw(H) = k we fix any (simple) k-tree that is a supergraph\nof H and denote it by H\u0303. Clearly, H inherits a construction sequence from H\u0303, where some edges\nare omitted.\nLemma 13. We have tw(H) \u2264 stw(H) \u2264 tw(H) + 1 for every graph H.\nProof. The first inequality is clear. For the second inequality we show that every k-tree H is a\nsubgraph of a simple (k+1)-tree H. Whenever in the construction sequence of H several vertices\n{v1 , . . . , vn } are stacked onto the same k-clique C we consider C \u222a {v1 } as a (k + 1)-clique in\nthe construction sequence for H. Stacking vi onto C now can be interpreted as stacking vi\nonto C \u222a {vi\u22121 } and omitting the edge vi\u22121 vi . In this way we can avoid multiple stackings onto\nk-cliques by considering (k + 1)-cliques.\n\n9\n\n\fSimple tree-width endows the notion of tree-width with a more topological flavor. For a\ngraph H we have the following: stw(H) \u2264 1 if and only if H is a linear forest, stw(H) \u2264 2 if\nand only if H is outerplanar, stw(H) \u2264 3 if and only if H is planar and tw(H) \u2264 3 [18].\nSimple tree-width also has connections to discrete geometry. In [12] a stacked polytope was\ndefined to be a polytope that admits a triangulation whose dual graph is a tree. From that paper\none easily deduces that a full-dimensional polytope P \u2282 Rd is stacked if and only if stw(GP ) \u2264 d.\nHere GP denotes the 1-skeleton of P . See [33, 34, 41] for more on simple tree-width.\nWe consider both graphs with bounded tree-width and graphs with bounded simple treewidth as input classes, since (A) most of the results for outerplanar graphs are implied by the\ncorresponding result for stw(H) \u2264 2, (B) lower bound results for stw(H) \u2264 3 carry over to planar\ngraphs, (C) the extremal results for these two input classes differ when the covering class is that\nof interval graphs, and (D) when the maximum covering numbers are the same for both classes,\nthe lower bounds are slightly stronger when witnessed by graphs of low simple tree-width.\nTheorem 14. We have tl (H) \u2264 stw(H) for every graph H.\nProof. If stw(H) = 1, then H is a linear forest and hence an interval graph. If stw(H) = 2, then\nH is outerplanar, and it even has track number at most 2 as shown in [42].\n* k \u2192 H with |\u03c6\u22121 (v)| \u2264 s for\nSo let stw(H) = s \u2265 3. We build an injective cover \u03c6 : I1 \u222a* * * * \u222aI\nevery v \u2208 V (H) and Ii \u2208 I for i \u2208 [k]. We use as I1 , . . . , Ik only certain interval graphs, which\nwe call slugs: A slug is like a caterpillar with a fixed spine, except that the graph Iiv induced by\nthe leaves at every spine vertex v \u2208 Ii is a linear forest. (In a caterpillar Iiv is an independent\nset for every spine vertex v.) The end vertices of the spine are called spine-ends and vertices\nof degree at most 1 in Iiv are called leaf-ends. See the left of Figure 2 for an example of a slug\nIi with the spine drawn thick, spine-ends in white, and leaf-ends in gray. Note that slugs are\nindeed interval graphs.\ne(C)\n\ne(C)\n\nx1\n\n\u2192\nv\n\nIiv\n\n\u2192\ne(C)\n\ne(C) x1\n\nFigure 2: A slug and its extension.\nWe define the cover \u03c6 along a construction sequence of H that is inherited from a simple\ns-tree H\u0303 \u2287 H. At every step let H \u2032 be the subgraph of H that is already constructed and hence\nalready covered by \u03c6, and let H\u0303 \u2032 be the corresponding subgraph of H\u0303. We call an s-clique C of\nH\u0303 \u2032 stackable if no vertex has been stacked to C so far. We maintain the following invariants on\n\u03c6, which allow us to stack a new vertex onto every stackable C.\nInvariant. At all times the following is satisfied for the current graph H \u2032 .\n1) For every vertex v in H \u2032 there is a unique slug I(v) with I(v) 6= I(w) for v 6= w, and a\nspine vertex s(v) of I(v) in \u03c6\u22121 (v).\n2) For every stackable s-clique C there is a vertex w1 \u2208 C, a slug I(C), and a spine-end or\nleaf-end e(C) of I(C) with \u03c6(e(C)) = w1 , such that:\n2a) If e(C) is a spine-end, then I(C) 6= I(v) for all v \u2208 V (H \u2032 ).\n2b) If e(C) is a leaf-end, then I(C) = I(w2 ) for some vertex w2 \u2208 C \\ {w1 }, and the\nvertices e(C) and s(w2 ) are adjacent in I(C).\n2c) Every leaf-end or spine-end v is e(C) for at most two cliques C with equality only if\nv has degree 0 or 1 in the slug.\n10\n\n\fIt is not difficult to satisfy the above invariants for an initial s-clique of H\u0303. Indeed, this\nclique can be build up in a very similar way to the stacking procedure that we describe now:\nIn the construction sequence of H we are about to stack a vertex w onto a stackable clique\nC of the current graph H \u2032 . Let C = {w1 , . . . , ws }. Without loss of generality we assume\nthat \u03c6(e(C)) = w1 and that if e(C) is a leaf-end, then I(C) = I(w2 ). We never change the\npreimages of vertices in H under \u03c6. In particular, all vertices we add to the existing or new\nslugs are mapped by \u03c6 onto the new vertex w. We will denote these new vertices by x1 , . . . , xs\nto emphasize that no more than s such vertices are introduced. Note that for every i \u2208 [s], the\nclique Ci in H\u0303 defined by Ci = (C \\ {wi }) \u222a {w} is stackable in H \u2032 \u222a {w}, and that all remaining\nstackable cliques in H \u2032 \u222a {w} are already stackable cliques in H \u2032 .\nFor i \u2208 {3, . . . , s} we do the following. If wwi \u2208 E(H), then we introduce a new leaf xi to\nI(wi ) at s(wi ), and if wwi \u2208\n/ E(H) we introduce a new slug consisting only of xi . Either way, we\nset e(Ci\u22121 ) = xi . Additionally we set e(C1 ) = xs . Note that 2b) is satisfied since wi , w \u2208 Ci\u22121\nand ws , w \u2208 C1 .\nIt remains to cover possible edges joining w to {w1 , w2 }, to find a spine-end or leaf-end e(Cs )\nfor Cs , and to find a slug I(w) for the new vertex w. In doing so we may still introduce two new\nvertices x1 and x2 to our slugs. We distinguish two cases, which are illustrated on the right in\nFigure 2.\nCase 1: If e(C) is a spine-end of I(C), then we first proceed with w2 similarly as with wi for\ni \u2265 3 above. That is, we introduce a new leaf x2 at s(w2 ) if ww2 \u2208 E(H) and a new slug\nconsisting only of x2 if ww2 \u2208\n/ E(H), and we set e(Cs ) = x2 .\nCase 1.1: If ww1 \u2208 E(H), then we introduce a new spine vertex x1 to I(C) adjacent\nto e(C). This covers the edge ww1 , since we assumed that \u03c6(e(C)) = w1 . We set\nI(w) = I(C), which satisfies condition 1) of the invariant since 2a) implies I(C) 6=\nI(v) for every vertex v in H \u2032 .\nCase 1.2: If ww1 \u2208\n/ E(H), then we introduce a new slug I consisting only of x1 and set\nI(w) = I.\nCase 2: If e(C) is a leaf-end of I(C), then by assumption we have I(C) = I(w2 ).\nCase 2.1: If ww2 \u2208 E(H), then we introduce a new leaf x2 to I(C) adjacent to s(w2 ) and\na new slug I consisting just of a new vertex x1 . If additionally ww1 \u2208 E(H), then we\nalso introduce an edge joining x2 and e(C) in I(C). Again, since \u03c6(e(C)) = w1 and\n\u03c6(x2 ) = w, this covers the edge ww1 . Either way, we set e(Cs ) = x2 and I(w) = I.\nCase 2.2: If ww2 \u2208\n/ E(H), then we introduce a new slug I consisting only of a new vertex\nx2 and set I(w) = I. When ww1 \u2208 E(H) we add a new leaf x1 to s(w1 ) in I(w1 ),\nand when ww1 \u2208\n/ E(H), then we introduce a new slug consisting only of x1 . Either\nway we set e(Cs ) = x1 .\nIt is straightforward to check that we obtain a I-cover of H \u2032 \u222a {w} and that the invariants\nabove are satisfied. Note that since H\u0303 is a simple s-tree, the clique C is no longer stackable and\nhence condition 2) of the invariant need not be satisfied in H \u2032 \u222a {w}. Finally, every stackable\nclique in H \u2032 different from C was not affected by the above procedure, which completes the\nproof.\nWe can prove three lower bounds for covering numbers.\nTheorem 15. For k \u2265 1, there is a bipartite graph H such that\nstw(H) \u2264 tw(H) + 1 \u2264 k + 1 \u2264 caf (H) = i(H).\n\n11\n\n\fProof. Construct H from Kk,n with n = 2k2 + 1 by adding a pendant vertex at each vertex\nof the larger partite set B. It is easy to see that tw(H) \u2264 k, and then Lemma 13 yields\nstw(H) \u2264 tw(H) + 1.\nConsider any Ca-cover \u03c6 of H with s = max{|\u03c6\u22121 (v)| : v \u2208 V (H)} and its restriction \u03c8\nto the subgraph H \u2032 of H obtained by removing all edges of Kk,n . By Lemma 11 there are at\nleast n \u2212 2sk = 2k(k \u2212 s) + 1 vertices b \u2208 B such that |\u03c8 \u22121 (b)| \u2264 |\u03c6\u22121 (b)| \u2212 k. Any such b is\nincident to an edge in H \\ Kk,n , which should be covered by \u03c8. Thus, |\u03c8 \u22121 (b)| \u2265 1. Hence,\ns \u2265 |\u03c6\u22121 (b)| \u2265 k + 1, so caf (H) \u2265 k + 1.\nTheorem 16. For k \u2265 3, there is a bipartite graph H such that\nstw(H) + 1 \u2264 k + 1 \u2264 ca(H) = t(H).\nProof. The construction of the graph H starts with H0 \u223c\n= Kk\u22121,m1 , where |B| = m1 = 2(2k2 \u2212\n2k + 1). Let B = {u1 , ..., um1 /2 } \u222a {v1 , ..., vm1 /2 }. For i \u2208 [m1 /2], add a copy Ii of K2,5k\u22125 with\ni,j\npartite sets {ui , vi } and {bi,j\n1 , ..., bk\u22121 : j \u2208 [5]}, calling the smaller set Ai and the larger set Bi .\nNext, let m2 = (k \u2212 2)+ 1. For (i, j) \u2208 [m1 /2] \u00d7 [5], add a set Bi,j of m2 new vertices and a copy\ni,j\nJi,j of Kk\u22121,m2 with partite sets bi,j\n1 , ..., bk\u22121 and Bi,j . Note that the smaller part Ai,j in Ji,j is\ncontained in Bi . See Figure 3 for an illustration.\nH:\n\nIi =\n\nI1\n\nk\u22121\n\nui\n\nk\u22121\n\nk\u22121\n\nJi4\n\nJi5\n\nm1\n\nk\u22121\n\nJi1\nI m1 \u22122\n2\n\nI m1\n\nvi\n\n2\n\n5(k \u2212 1)\nFigure 3: The graph H and its induced subgraph Ii and Jj .\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that \u03c6 is an injective Ca-cover of H of size at most k.\nConsider the restriction \u03c8 of \u03c6 to the subgraph H \u2032 = H \\ E(H0 ) of H. By Lemma 11 there are\nat least m1 \u2212 2k(k \u2212 1) = 2k 2 \u2212 2k + 2 > m21 vertices in b \u2208 B with |\u03c8 \u22121 (b)| \u2264 1. In particular\nthere is some i\u2032 \u2208 [ m21 ] such that |\u03c8 \u22121 (u\u2032i )|, |\u03c8 \u22121 (vi\u2032 )| \u2264 1. That is, in the covering u\u2032i and vi\u2032 each\nappear in only one caterpillar forest, which we call Cu\u2032i containing ui and Cvi\u2032 containing vi\u2032 . Now\nconsider the restriction \u03c6 of \u03c8 to the subgraph H \u2032\u2032 = H \u2032 \\ E(Ii\u2032 ) of H \u2032 . Again by Lemma 11\nthere are at least 5(k \u2212 1) \u2212 4 vertices b \u2208 Bi\u2032 with |\u03c6\u22121 (b)| \u2264 k \u2212 2. In particular there is some\nj \u2032 \u2208 [5] such that |\u03c6\u22121 (b)| \u2264 k \u2212 2 for all b \u2208 Ai\u2032 j \u2032 .\nIn other words, \u03c6 restricted to H[Ai\u2032 j \u2032 \u222a Bi\u2032 j \u2032 ] is an injective Ca-cover of Kk\u22121,(k\u22122)2 +1 of size\nm\nl\n2 +k\u22121\n= k \u2212 1, due\nat most k \u2212 2, which is impossible, since ca(Kk\u22121,(k\u22122)2 +1 ) = (k\u22121)(k\u22122)\n2\nk\u22121+(k\u22122)\nto [10].\nIt remains to show that stw(H) \u2264 k. In order to describe the construction sequence for a\nsimple k-tree containing H, we introduce some further vertex labels. Let A0 = {a1 , . . . , ak\u22121 }\nij\nbe the smaller partite set of H0 , recall that Bi = Ai1 \u222a . . . \u222a Ai5 where Aij = {bij\n1 , . . . , bk\u22121 } for\n12\n\n\fij\nm1\nall i \u2208 [ m21 ], j \u2208 [5], and let Bij = {cij\n1 , . . . , cm2 } for i \u2208 [ 2 ], j \u2208 [5]. We construct a simple\nk-tree starting with a (k + 1)-clique on A \u222a {u1 , v1 } via the following stackings:\n\n\u2200i \u2208 {2, . . . , m21 }\n\nA Stack ui onto A \u222a {vi\u22121 } and vi onto A \u222a {ui }\n\n\u2200i \u2208 [ m21 ], l \u2208 [k \u2212 1]\n\ni1\ni1\nB Stack bi1\nl onto {a1 , . . . , ak\u2212l\u22121 , ui , vi , b1 , . . . , bl\u22121 }\ni(j\u22121)\n\nC Stack bij\nl onto {ui , vi , b1\n\ni(j\u22121)\n\nij\n, . . . , bk\u2212l\u22121 , bij\n1 , . . . , bl\u22121 }\n\n\u2200i \u2208 [ m21 ], l \u2208 [k \u2212 1], j \u2265 2\n\nij\nij\nD Stack cij\n1 onto Aij \u222a {ui } and cl onto Aij \u222a {cl\u22121 }\n\n\u2200i \u2208 [ m21 ], j \u2208 [5], l \u2265 2\n\nOne can check that after step A. the entire graph H0 is contained in the so-far constructed ktree. Step B. deals with the complete bipartite graphs induced on {ui , vi } \u222a Ai1 for all i \u2208 [ m21 ],\nstep C. adds the remaining complete bipartite graphs induced on {ui , vi } \u222a Aij for j \u2265 2, such\nthat afterwards all Ii are contained. In step D. all edges and vertices necessary for the Jij are\ncreated. Since no k-clique appears twice we conclude that stw(H) \u2264 k.\nTheorem 17. For k \u2265 2, there is a graph H such that\nstw(H) + 1 \u2264 k + 1 \u2264 caf (H).\nProof. Fix k \u2265 2. We construct H starting with a star with k \u2212 1 leaves l1 , . . . , lk\u22121 and center\nc1 . In the simple partial k-tree containing H this star is a k-clique. For n = 16k2 \u2212 16k + 4\nand 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n stack a new vertex ci to l1 , . . . , lk\u22121 , ci\u22121 . Now stack vertices s2 , . . . , sn to\nl1 , . . . , lk\u22122 , ci\u22121 , ci . Finally introduce a pendant vertex ai as a neighbor of si , for each i. In the\nsimple partial k-tree containing H, the vertex ai is stacked to the k-clique on l1 , . . . , lk\u22122 , ci\u22121 , si .\nBy construction stw(H) \u2264 k.

That is, there is a Ca-cover \u03c6 of\nH with |\u03c6\u22121 (v)| \u2264 k for all v \u2208 V (H). We consider three edge-disjoint complete bipartite\nsubgraphs H1 , H2 , H3 of H with partite sets Ai and Bi for Hi defined as follows:\n\u2022 A1 = l1 , . . . , lk\u22121 and B1 = {c2i : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n/2}\n\u2022 A2 = l1 , . . . , lk\u22121 and B2 = {c2i\u22121 : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n/2}\n\u2022 A3 = l1 , . . . , lk\u22122 and B3 = {si : 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n}\n13\n\n\fNote that Hi and Hj are edge-disjoint for i 6= j. Denote by \u03c8 the restriction of \u03c6 to\nH \\ (E(H1 ) \u222a E(H2 ) \u222a E(H3 )). We apply Lemma 11 three times, once for each Hi , but the\nbounds for restrictions of \u03c6 to H \\ E(Hi ) clearly also apply to \u03c8. Thus, we obtain sets Wi \u2282 Bi\n(for each i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}). For i \u2208 {1, 2} we get |Wi | \u2265 n/2 \u2212 2k(k \u2212 1) and \u03c8 \u22121 (b) \u2264 k \u2212 (k \u2212 1) = 1\nfor b \u2208 Wi . Furthermore we have |W3 | \u2265 n \u2212 1 \u2212 2k(k \u2212 2) and \u03c8 \u22121 (b) \u2264 k \u2212 (k \u2212 2) = 2\nfor b \u2208 W3 . From the choice of n it follows that there exist ci , ci+1 , ci+2 , ci+3 \u2208 W1 \u222a W2 with\nconsecutive indices such that si+1 , si+2 , si+3 \u2208 W3 . Together with the leaves ai+1 , ai+2 , ai+3\nthese vertices induce a 10-vertex graph H \u2032 highlighted in Figure 4. It is not difficult to check\nthat there is no Ca-cover \u03c8 of H \u2032 with |\u03c8 \u22121 (ci+j )| \u2264 1 for j \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3} and |\u03c8 \u22121 (si+j )| \u2264 2 for\nj \u2208 {1, 2, 3} - a contradiction.\n\n5.3\n\nPlanar and Outerplanar Graphs\n\nDetermining maximum covering numbers of (bipartite) planar graphs and outerplanar graphs\nenjoys a certain popularity, as demonstrated by the variety of citations in Table 1. We add three\neasy new results to the list.\nCorollary 18. The star arboricity of bipartite planar graphs is at most 4. The local star arboricity of planar graphs and bipartite planar graphs is at most 4 and at most 3, respectively.\nProof. As mentioned\nl\nm in Section 4.2, the arboricity a(H) of every graph H can be expressed as\n|E[S]|\nmaxS\u2286V (H) |S|\u22121 [46]. By Euler's Formula every planar graph has at most 3V (H) \u2212 6 edges\nand every bipartite planar graph has at most 2V (H) \u2212 4 edges and clearly both classes are\nclosed under taking subgraphs. Together it follows that every planar graph has arboricity at\nmost 3 and every planar bipartite graph has arboricity at most 2. With this, the statement\nabout global star arboricity follows since we have sa(H) \u2264 2a(H) by [6]. The statements about\nlocal arboricity follow since we have sal (H) \u2264 a(H) + 1 by Theorem 9.\nThe only question mark in Table 1 concerns the local track number of planar graphs. Scheinerman and West [52] show that the interval number of planar graphs is at most 3, but this is\nverified with a cover that is not injective. On the other hand, there are bipartite planar graphs\nwith track number 4 [24]. However by Corollary 18 and Theorem 14 every bipartite planar graph\nand every planar graph of tree-width at most 3 has local track number at most 3. We believe\nthat there are planar graphs with local track number 4, but the following remains open:\nQuestion 19. What is the maximum local track number of a planar graphs?\n\n6\n\nSeparability and Complexity\n\nThis section is devoted to different types of questions. First, we investigate how much global,\nlocal, and folded covering numbers can differ with respect to the same covering and input class.\nSecond, we look at the complexity of computing these parameters.\nIn Table 1 we provide several pairs of an input class H and a covering class G for which the\nG\nG\nglobal covering number and the local covering number differ, i.e., cg (H ) > cl (H ). Indeed this\ndifference can be arbitrarily large.\nTheorem 20. For the covering class Q of collections of cliques and the input class H of line\ngraphs, we have cQg (H ) = \u221e and cQl (H ) \u2264 2.\nProof. By a result of Whitney [58] a graph H is a line graph if and only if cQl (H) \u2264 2.\nTo prove cQg (H ) = \u221e, we claim that cQg (L(Kn )) \u2208 \u03a9(log n), i.e., the covering number of\nthe line graph of the complete graph on n vertices is unbounded as n goes to infinity. Assume\nthat L(Kn ) is covered by k collections of cliques C1 , . . . , Ck . Every clique in L(Kn ) corresponds\nto either a triangle or a star in Kn . Now, every Ci in L(Kn ) corresponds to a vertex disjoint\ncollection of triangles and stars in Kn . Together these collections cover the edges of Kn . We\n14\n\n\fwill restrict the covering of L(Kn ) to a covering of L(Km ) with collections of cliques all of whose\ncliques correspond to stars in Km . In the first step delete at most 13 n vertices of Kn such that in\nthe restricted cover of the smaller line graph no clique in C1 corresponds to a triangle. Repeating\nthis for every Ci , we end up with a clique cover of L(Km ) with m \u2265 ( 32 )k n that\n\u0006 \u0007 corresponds\nto a cover of Km with star forests. Since by [4] the star arboricity of Km is m\n2 + 1, we get\n2 k\u22121\n>\n(\n)\nn,\nand\nthus\nk\n\u2208\n\u03a9(log\nn).\nk \u2265 m+2\n2\n3\nRemark 21. Milans, Stolee, and West [44] proved a similar result with interval graphs as covering class, i.e., they showed that the growth rate of t(L(Kn )) is between \u03a9(log log n/ log log log n)\nand O(log log n), while i(H) \u2264 2 for every line graph H.\nA case of particular interest to us is the input class of claw-free graphs \u2013 a class containing\nline graphs. It has been shown that this class has unbounded local clique covering number [37].\nWe conjecture the following stronger statement:\nConjecture 22. The class of claw-free graphs has unbounded interval number.\nWhat can be said about local and folded covering number? Table 1 suggests that the\nG\nseparation of the local and the folded covering number is more difficult. Indeed we have cl (H ) =\nG\ncf (H ) for every G and H in Table 1, except for the local track number of planar graphs, (c.f.\nG\n\nQuestion 19). However, proving upper bounds for cl (H ) can be significantly more elaborate\nG\nthan for cf (H ), even if we suspect that both values are equal; see for example Conjecture 1 and\nTheorem 3.\nObserving that there is no injective cover of a path by cycles of length at least 3 and that\nevery path is the homomorphic image of a cycle one gets:\nObservation 23. For the covering class C of collections of cycles of length at least 3 and the\ninput class H of paths, we have cCl (H ) = \u221e and cCf (H ) \u2264 2.\nObservation 23 may be considered pathological. However, the local and folded covering\nG\nnumber may differ also when cl (H) < \u221e. We gave one example for this when considering\ncoverings of the Petersen graph with disjointlunionsm of cycles, see Proposition\n6. mHere is anl\nmn+1\nmn\nother example: It is known that i(Km,n ) = m+n [32] and t(Km,n ) = m+n\u22121 [28]. The\nl\nm\nmn\nlower bound on t(Km,n ) presented in [14] indeed gives tl (Km,n ) \u2265 m+n\u22121\nand hence we have\ntl (Km,n ) > i(Km,n ) for appropriate numbers m and n, such as n = m2 \u2212 2m + 2. With Proposition 4 this translates into cal (Km,n ) > caf (Km,n ). Apart from these examples, we have no\ngeneral answer to the following question.\nQuestion 24. By how much can folded and local covering number differ?\nAnother interesting aspect of covering numbers concerns the computational complexity of\nG\ndetermining them. Very informally, one might suspect that the computation of cf (H) is easier\nG\n\nG\n\nthan of cl (H), which in turn is easier than computing cg (H). For example, if M is the class\n\u2032\nof all matchings, then cM\ng (H) = \u03c7 (H), the edge-chromatic number of H. Hence deciding\nM\ncM\ng (H) \u2264 3 is NP-complete even for 3-regular graphs [35]. On the other hand cl (H) equals the\nmaximum degree of H and can therefore be determined very efficiently. As a second example,\nmore elaborate, consider the star arboricity sa(H) and the caterpillar arboricity ca(H). Deciding\nsa(H) \u2264 k [24,29] and deciding ca(H) \u2264 k [24,53] are NP-complete for k = 2, 3. The complexity\nfor k \u2265 4 is unknown in both cases. To the best of our knowledge, the complexity of determining\nthe local and folded caterpillar arboricity of a graph is also open. On the other hand, from\nTheorem 9 we can derive the following.\nTheorem 25. The local star arboricity can be computed in polynomial-time.\n\n15\n\n\fProof. In [22] a flow algorithm is used that given a graph H and \u03b1 : V (H) \u2192 N decides if an\norientation D of H exists such that the out-degree of v in D is at most \u03b1(v) for all v \u2208 V (H).\nMoreover, if such a D exists the algorithm finds one minimizing the maximum out-degree. Now\nby Lemma 7, we may use this algorithm to find p(H) in polynomial-time. Now let \u03b1(v) = p(H)\nwhenever v has degree p(H) and \u03b1(v) = p(H)\u22121 otherwise. We use the algorithm of [22] to check\nif an orientation D of H satisfying the out-degree constraints given by \u03b1 exists. By Theorem 9\nwe have sal (H) = p(H) if and only if there exists such an orientation and sal (H) = p(H) + 1\notherwise.\nFinally, consider interval graphs as the covering class. Shmoys and West [54] and Jiang [39]\nshowed that deciding i(H) \u2264 k and deciding t(H) \u2264 k are NP-complete for every k \u2265 2,\nrespectively. We claim that the reduction of Jiang also holds for the local track number.\nQuestion 26. Are there a covering and an input class for which the computation of the folded\nor local covering number is NP-complete while the global covering number can be computed in\npolynomial-time?\n\n7\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe have presented new ways to cover a graph and given many example covering classes. Also,\nwe highlighted some conjectures and questions on the way, such as the question whether the\nmaximum track number of planar graphs is 3 or 4 (Question 19).\nOne conjecture important to us is LLAC (Conjecture 1), which is a weakening of the linear\narboricity conjecture (LAC). Besides LLAC, there are several more weakenings of LAC that are\nstill open. For example it is open,\nm the caterpillar arboricity of graph H of maximum\nl whether\n. Yet a weaker, but still open, question asks whether\ndegree \u2206(H) is always at most \u2206(H)+1\n2\nm\nl\n. As a positive result, by Theorem 9 one\nthe track number of H is always at most \u2206(H)+1\n2\nl\nm\nobtains that for a regular graph H of even degree the local star-arboricity is \u2206(H)+1\n, which\n2\nin particular settles the question for local caterpillar arboricity and local track number for such\ninput graphs. On the other hand, Theoreml9 also tells\nm us that in a regular graph H of odd\n\u2206(H)+1\n. To the best of our knowledge, it is open\ndegree the local star arboricity is larger than\n2\nwhether\nl the local\nm caterpillar arboricity or local track number of such a graph H is always at\n\u2206(H)+1\nmost\n.\n2\nApart from the problems already mentioned throughout the paper, it is interesting to consider\nthe local and folded variants for more graph covering problems from the literature. For example\nthe covering number with respect to planar and outerplanar graphs is known as the thickness and\nouterthickness [11], respectively, and the folded covering number with respect to planar graphs\nis called the splitting number [36]. The local covering number in these cases seems unexplored.\nFurther interesting covering classes include linear forests of bounded length [8], forests of stars\nand triangles [20], and chordal graphs.\nA concept dual to covering is packing. For an input graph H and a class G of packing graphs,\nwe define a G-packing of H to be an edge-injective homomorphism \u03c6 to H from the disjoint\n* 2 \u222a* * * * \u222aG\n* k with Gi \u2208 G for i \u2208 [k]. The size of a packing is the number of packing\nunion G1 \u222aG\ngraphs in the disjoint union. A packing \u03c6 is injective if \u03c6|Gi , that is, \u03c6 restricted to Gi , is\ninjective for every i \u2208 [k].\nDefinition 2. For a packing class G and an input graph H = (V, E) define the (global) packing\nG\nG\nG\nnumber pg (H), the local packing number pl (H), and the folded packing number pf (H) as follows:\nG\n\npg (H) = max {size of \u03c6 : \u03c6 is an injective G-packing of H}\n\b\nG\npl (H) = max minv\u2208V |\u03c6\u22121 (v)| : \u03c6 is an injective G-packing of H\n16\n\n\f\b\nG\npf (H) = max minv\u2208V |\u03c6\u22121 (v)| : \u03c6 is a G-packing of H having size 1\nG\n\nG\n\nG\n\nLet us rephrase pg (H), pl (H), and pf (H): The packing number is the maximum number\nof packing graphs that can be packed into the input graph, where packing means identifying\nedge-disjoint subgraphs in H that lie in G. The local packing number does not measure the\nnumber of packing graphs in a packing; instead the minimum number of graphs packed at any\none vertex is maximized. The folded packing number is the maximum k such that every vertex v\nof H can be split into k vertices, distributing the incident edges at v arbitrarily (not repeatedly)\namong them, such that the resulting graph is in G. Two classical packing problems are given\nby G being the class of non-planar graphs or non-outerplanar graphs. In this case the global\npacking numbers are called coarseness and outercoarseness [11], respectively.\nAcknowledgments: We thank Marie Albenque, Daniel Heldt, and Bartosz Walczak for\nfruitful discussions and two anonymous referees and Douglas B.
