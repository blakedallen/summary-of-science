A brief overview is given on precision determinations of values of the\nfundamental physical constants and the search for their variation with time by\nmeans of precision spectroscopy in the optical domain.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe electron and proton are involved in various phenomena of different fields\nof physics. As a result, fundamental physical constants related to their properties (such as electron/proton charge (e), the electron and proton masses\n(me and mp ), the Rydberg constant (Ry), the fine structure constant (\u03b1)\netc), can be traced in various basic equations of physics of atoms, molecules,\nsolid state, nuclei and particles etc. Until recently most accurate measurements came from radio frequency experiments only, which supplied us with\nprecise values of most of the fundamental constants and accurate tests of the\nquantum theory of simple atoms (bound state QED). The optical measurements delivered to us a value for the Rydberg constant, but were not accurate\nenough to provide any competitive test of the QED.\nDuring the last decade the status of the optical measurements changed\ndramatically because of\n\u2022 advances in atomic spectroscopy, for example, Doppler-free two-photon\nspectroscopy of atomic hydrogen, with significantly increased resolution;\n\u2022 advances in the technology for measuring optical frequencies. New frequency chains routinely deliver the high accuracy of the microwave cesium radiation (related to the definition of the second ) to the optical\ndomain.\nTwo-photon methods were developed for hydrogen spectroscopy at Stanford, Oxford, LKB (Laboratoire Kastler Brossel), Yale and MPQ during two\nlast decades (see a review in [1]). Improved accuracy of the Rydberg constant\nby few orders of magnitude is supplying us with a precision test of the theory\nof the Lamb shift in hydrogen and deuterium atoms (see [2] and references\ntherein). The accuracy of these tests is even higher than from traditional\nmicrowave measurements. We discuss that in detail in Sect. 2.\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: sek@mpq.mpg.de\n\n\f2\n\nSavely G. Karshenboim\n\nThe progress with the spectroscopy of the 1s \u2212 2s transition [3] and with\nthe development of a new type of frequency chain [4] was so large, that\nthe transition offered also an opportunity to search for a variation of the\nfundamental constants with time. The appearance of the new frequency chain\ndeveloped at MPQ [4] and successfully applied at several laboratories (MPQ,\nJILA [5], NIST, PTB) has greatly changed the situation with the optical\nmeasurements (see a review in [6]). This is important for metrology and\nthe design of new frequency standards, for the search of variations of the\nfundamental constants and for numerous other applications. We consider the\napplication to the search for such variations in Sect. 3.\n\n2\n\nRydberg Constant and the Lamb Shift in the\nHydrogen Atom\n\nThe discovery of the Lamb shift in the hydrogen atom was a starting point\nof the most advanced quantum theory - Quantum electrodynamics (QED).\nThis theory predicts a number of quantities with a great accuracy. There\nare only a few examples where an accurate theory also allows precise measurements. Those are [7,8] the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron\nand muon and some transition frequencies in simple atoms (see e.g. Fig. 1).\nMost success was obtained with the study of the hydrogen atom. However,\nthe progress of traditional microwave measurements has been quite slow and\nreached the 10 ppm level of accuracy only for the hydrogen Lamb shift\n(Fig. 2).\nIt turned out that the two-photon Doppler-free spectroscopy of gross\nstructure transitions (such as 1s \u2212 2s, 1s \u2212 3s, 2s \u2212 4s etc) allowed access\nto narrower levels and could deliver very accurate values sensitive to QED\neffects. But to interpret those values in terms of the Lamb shift, two problems\nhad to be solved:\n\u2022 the Rydberg constant determines a dominant part of any optical transition and has to be known itself;\n\u2022 a number of levels are involved and it is necessary to be able to find\nrelationships between the Lamb shifts (EL ) of different levels. Otherwise\nthe experimental data would be of no use because the number of unknown\nquantities exceeds the number of measured transitions.\nThe former problem has been solved by comparison of two transitions\ndetermining both: the Rydberg and the QED contributions. Presently the\ntwo best results to combine are the 1s \u2212 2s frequency in hydrogen and deuterium [3,9] and the 2s \u2212 8s/d transition in the same atoms [10]. The latter\nproblem has been solved with a help of a specific difference [11]\n\u2206(n) = EL (1s) \u2212 n3 EL (ns) ,\n\n(1)\n\n\fPrecision Measurements and Fundamental Constants\n2p3/2\n\n3\n\ngrand average\n\nfine structure\n\ncomparison Garching\n\n2s1/2\n\n- Paris\n\nLamb splitting\n2p1/2\n\nLS\n\naverages\n\nFS\nOBF\n\ntwo-photon transition\n\ntheory\n\n(gross structure)\n1s1/2\n\n1057 800 kHz\n\nFig. 1. Example of different transitions in hydrogen atom. Transitions within the fine structure\nand Lamb splitting are in the microwave range, while the 1s \u2212\n2s two-photon transition lies in\nultraviolet domain. The Lamb\nsplitting is the difference of Lamb\nshift of 2s1/2 and 2p1/2 levels.\n\nFig. 2. Present status of the Lamb splitting in hydrogen (2s1/2 \u2212 2p1/2 ). The\nfigure contains values derived from various experiments. LS stands for the Lamb\nsplitting measurements (see Fig. 1), FS is\nfor the fine structure, and OBF stands\nfor optical beat frequency (simultaneous measurement of two optical transitions). The theoretical estimation is taken\nfrom [14]\n\n1057 850 kHz\n\n1057 900 kHz\n\nwhich can be calculated more accurately than the Lamb shift of the individual\nlevels.\nA successful deduction of the Lamb shift (Fig. 2) in the hydrogen atom\nprovides us with a precision test of bound state QED and offers an opportunity to learn more about the proton size. Bound state QED is quite different\nfrom QED for free particles. The bound state problem is complicated itself\neven in the case of the classical mechanics. The hydrogen atom is the simplest atomic system; however, a theoretical result for the energy levels is\nexpressed as a complicated function (often a perturbative expansion) of a\nnumber of small parameters [7] (see review [13] for a collection of theoretical\ncontributions):\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u03b1, which counts the QED loops;\nthe Coulomb strength Z\u03b1;\nelectron-to-proton mass ratio;\nratio of the proton radius to the Bohr radius.\n\nIndeed, in hydrogen Z = 1, the origin of the correction is very important and\nthe behaviour of expansions in \u03b1 and Z\u03b1 differs from each other. In particular,\nthe latter involves large logarithms (ln(1/Z\u03b1) \u223c 5) [7,12] and big coefficients.\nIt is not possible to do any exact calculations and one must at least use\nexpansions in some parameters. In such a case the hardest theoretical problem\nis not to make the calculation, but rather to estimate the uncalculated terms\nrelated to higher-order corrections of the expansion.\n\n\f4\n\nSavely G. Karshenboim\n\nThe other problem is due to the proton size [14] which lead to a dominant\nuncertainty of the theory. The finite size of the proton leads to a simple\nexpression, but to obtain its numerical value one needs to determine the\nvalue for the proton charge radius. Unfortunately no such measurements are\navailable at the moment. It happens now that the most accurate value can\nbe obtained from a comparison of the experimental value of the Lamb shift\nderived from the optical measurements of the hydrogen and QED theory [14].\nThe other quantity deduced from the optical measurements on hydrogen\nand deuterium is the Rydberg constant. The recent progress is clearly seen\nfrom the recommended CODATA values of 1986 and 1998 [15]:\nRy86 = 10 973 731.534(13) m\u22121 and Ry98 = 10 973 731.568 549(83) m\u22121 .\nThe former value was derived from one-photon transitions (Balmer series)\nand was slightly improved later (by a factor of 4.5), but all further progress\nthat led to the 1998's value (30 times improvement) was a result of the\nstudy of two-photon transitions in hydrogen and deuterium. Fig. 3 shows a\ncomparison of several recently published values for the Rydberg constant.\n\nRy \u2212 10 973 731.568 [m\u22121]\n\n8*10\u22124\n7*10\u22124\n6*10\u22124\n5*10\u22124\n4*10\u22124\n3*10\u22124\n2*10\u22124\n1*10\u22124\n\nCODATA\n\n0\n1992\n\n1994\n\n1996\n\n1998\n\n2000\n\nDate of publications\n\nFig. 3. Recent progress in the determination of the Rydberg constant (mainly at\nMPQ and LKB)\n\nSome other fundamental constants can also be determined by means of\nlaser spectroscopy. To complete the overview let us mention determination of\n\u2022 the muon-to-electron mass ratio from three-photon ionization of the ground\nstate of muonium at a resonance point of the two-photon excitation of\nthe 2s state [16];\n\u2022 the fine structure constant \u03b1 derived from the helium fine structure;\n\u2022 the fine structure constant deduced from Raman recoil spectroscopy of\nthe cesium D1 line [17]. For this evaluation a precise value of the absolute\nfrequency of the D1 line is also necessary.\n\n\fPrecision Measurements and Fundamental Constants\n\n3\n\n5\n\nOptical Measurements and Variation of the\nFundamental Constants with Time\n\nAfter the success with understanding of the electromagnetic, weak and, in\npart, strong interaction we arrived at some sort of threshold of new physics.\nNaturally, it is not clear on which front one is most likely to discover new\nphysical phenomena. The present-day attempts to discover new physics are\nrather a kind of a random search for a hidden treasure. Unfortunately, lacking\nof theoretical predictions there seems to be no better method up to now. One\nof few directions of such a search is related to the variation of the fundamental\nconstants with time. There is no common model for such a phenomena, but\nthe accepted picture of the evolution of our universe strongly implies for that.\n'Variation' means a slow drift or oscillation of parameters of the interaction\nand particle properties (like their masses). We commonly believe that during\na small fraction of the very first second our universe came through a number\nof phase transitions and the interactions and particles as we know them now\ndid not exist before those transitions. So, philosophically speaking, we have to\nacknowledge the variation of constants as some kind of trace of the early great\nchanges. Physically speaking, we understand that the critical question for a\ndetection of the variation is the rate at which it occurs, because variation\nrates of 10\u221210 yr\u22121 and 10\u221220 yr\u22121 are not the same. Variation of, e. g.\nthe fine structure constant, at the former limit would have already been\ndetected a few decades ago, while the latter rate will rather be a challenge\nfor physicists in a few decades. Present-day searches are related to a level of\n10\u221213 \u2212 10\u221215 yr\u22121 , which corresponds to a fractional shift of the constants\nsmaller than than 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22125 for the life-time of the universe.\nThere are a number of possibilities for such a search, but the optical measurements play a specific role, because of their clear interpretation. However,\nthe fact of variation is more important than the accurate interpretation. In\nthe case of a negative result no limitation for a variation can be assigned\nwithout a reasonable interpretation. From the theoretical point of view we\nhave to expect simultaneous variations of all coupling constants, masses and\nmagnetic moments. If one wishes to find a solid interpretation, some reduction of all variable quantities to a very few is important. However, nuclear\nproperties are the result of the strong interactions and involve effects, that\ncannot be calculated. Only optical transitions are completely free from this\nproblem.\nWe summarize a comparison of different searches in Table 1 [18]. Let us\ndiscuss briefly the specific features of the different methods.\n\u2022 To detect a variation one needs to compare some quantity A(t) measured\nat time t and t + \u2206t. However, the obvious estimation of the variation\nrate \u2206A/\u2206t is valid only in the case of a slow drift. In the case of oscillations, and such oscillations were suggested because of some astrophysical\nreasons, the estimate must be rather \u2206A/T , where T is the half-period of\n\n\f6\n\nSavely G. Karshenboim\n\nTable 1. Comparison of different kinds of searches for a variation of fundamental\nconstants. Here T is a half-period of oscillations and \u2206t is a time separation for\na comparison. The Laboratory search contains all laboratory measurements, while\nOptical transitions are for comparison of only optical transitions. The limitation\nexpected in 1-2 years are also presented.\n\nOscillation\nSpace\nStatistics\nStrong Int.\n\u03b1\nme /mp\ngp\ngn\nLimitations\nIn 1-2 years\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nGeochemical\nstudy\n\u2206t > T\n\u2212\n\u2212\nsensitive\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n10\u221217 yr\u22121\n\nAstrophysical\nobservation\n\u2206t > T\nimportant\nessential\nnot sensitive\n+\n+\n+\n\u2212\n10\u221215 yr\u22121\n\nLaboratory\nsearch\nphase - ?\n\u2212\nsensitive\n+\n+\n+\n+\n10\u221215 yr\u22121\n\nOptical\ntransitions\nphase - ?\n\u2212\n\u2212\nnot sensitive\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n10\u221213 yr\u22121\n10\u221214 yr\u22121\n\nthe oscillation (\u223c 108 yr). That makes astrophysical (\u03b4t \u223c 1010 yr) and\ngeochemical (\u03b4t \u223c 2 * 109 yr) estimates much weaker, while in the case of\nany laboratory experiments we arrive at the question of the phase of such\nan oscillation. One sees the laboratory search and a search over time (and\nspace) are two different kinds of experiments and serve different purposes.\nAstrophysical data owe two features different from others. First, we can\nobserve the object separated from us both in space and time as there\nmight be a correlation between time- and space- variations. Secondly,\nthe astrophysical data are hard to interpret on an event-by-event base.\nThey used to be treated statistically and it is necessary to study the\ncorrelations of the data.\nAnother important question for interpretations is involvement of the\nstrong interactions. In the case of geochemical data that is the main\neffect and there is no reasonable interpretation of such data at all. In\nthe case of laboratory measurements, the strong interaction is important\nbecause of the nuclear magnetic moments (see below).\nWe can look only for variations of dimensionless quantities such as a\nratio of two frequencies and we need to reduce them to a variation of few\ndimensionless constants, which are the fine structure constant \u03b1, electronto-proton mass ratio, g-factors of proton and neutron. That is possible\nbecause of two reasons, which are\n\u2013 known non-relativistic dependence of any transition frequency on the\nfundamental constants;\n\u2013 the Schmidt model predicts nuclear magnetic moments for odd Z;\nNon-relativistic theory in particular predicts (see [18] for details), that\n\n\fPrecision Measurements and Fundamental Constants\n\n7\n\n\u2013 any gross structure transition frequency depends only on the Rydberg\nconstant (\u223c Ry);\n\u2013 any fine structure transition frequency is proportional to \u03b12 Ry;\n\u2013 any hyperfine structure transition is proportional to \u03b12 (\u03bc/\u03bcB )Ry,\nwhere \u03bc is the nuclear magnetic moment and \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton.\n\u2022 The Schmidt model predicts the magnetic moment of nuclei with odd\nmass number A as a result of the spin and orbit contribution of a single\nnucleon (the remaining protons and neutrons are coupled in pairs and\ndo not contribute). Indeed that is a very rough model, but there is no\nother way to reduce all magnetic moments to few quantities (me /mp , gp ,\ngn ). The problem of interpretation is now related to the inaccuracy of\nthe Schmidt model because of the strong interaction which is not under\ncontrol.\nThe present-day level of limitations is different for various methods and\nthe optical experiments do not look as a good choice in general and in comparison with other laboratory experiments. However, the discussion above\nexplains in part that there is no clear interpretation of the geochemical data\nand there are some doubts in the astrophysical data. There is a single laboratory result in Table 1 that is better than 10\u221213 yr\u22121 : a comparison of the\nhyperfine splitting in Rb and Cs [19]. This experiment could be a search for a\nvariation of gp . Such an interpretation is valid only if the Schmidt model can\nbe applied, but unfortunately there are essential deviations from the Schmidt\nmodel due to the strong interaction (mainly in Cs). The actual interpretation\nremains unclear.\nWe briefly discuss optical laboratory experiments below. The current limitations are quite weak (\u223c 10\u221213 yr \u22121 ) because most of the results were\nobtained recently on a level of a fractional uncertainty of 10\u221214 (see Table 2).\nThese limitations were obtained either after a short-term monitoring or after\na comparison with a previous less accurate result. Future limitations based\non reproduction of the recent experiments in 2000-2001 must easily deliver\nlimitations better by an order of magnitude.\nSince all the transitions in Table 2 are related to the gross structure\none could wonder how to obtain any information about a variation of the\nfine structure constant if all of them are proportional (in the non-relativistic\napproximation) to the Rydberg constant. The signal is due to the relativistic\ncorrections. Their importance (for the hyperfine structure) was first pointed\nout in [23] and they were later calculated for a bunch of the optical transitions\nin [24]. The transition frequency is now equal to c Ry Frel (\u03b1) and a non-trivial\nrelativistic factor Frel (\u03b1) is a key point to look for a variation of the fine\nstructure constant by optical means. The sensitivity \u03ba = \u2202 ln Frel (\u03b1)/\u2202 ln \u03b1\nto a variation of \u03b1 is given in Table 2 accordingly to [24].\n\n\f8\n\nSavely G. Karshenboim\n\nTable 2.

This approach has\nthe advantage of a high short-term stability as compared with cesium standard. This allows for a simple time structure of the experiment [18] with\na few direct comparisons. A comparison with cesium often involves some\nsecondary standard with a high short-term stability. Such a clock being an\nartefact that is not related to any transition should involve an unknown drift\nwith time as the constants are drifting. Their short time stability cannot be\nactually proved. A common reason for a statement on the good short-time\nstability of such a standard (like a hydrogen maser for example) is that the\nscattering of their frequencies with time is small. But there is no idea about\na possible common mode rejection. The stronger reason to believe in a good\nshort term stability is a comparison between different clocks. But still there\nmight be a common mode rejection as it should be the case for a variation of\nthe constants. A direct comparison of two optical transitions allows to avoid\nthis problem and offers a new opportunity to securely derive a limitation for\na variation of the fine structure constant or maybe even to detect such a\nvariation.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nNowadays, optical spectroscopy of atoms provides an essential input for the\ndetermination of the fundamental physical constants, including the most accurately known fundamental constant, the Rydberg constant, which plays an\nimportant role in atomic physics. The so-called atomic unit of frequency and\nenergy are related to this constant being c * Ry and h * c * Ry respectively.\nA definition of the second , attractive from a general point of view, could be\n\n\fPrecision Measurements and Fundamental Constants\n\n9\n\nbased on a fixed value of the Rydberg constant. This would be practically\nacceptable after the following steps are achieved:\n\u2022 the completion of a frequency chain that connects the optical with microwave domain and, at the same time allows for a comparison of any\noptical transition with the 1s \u2212 2s frequency on in hydrogen (done at\nMPQ [4] and used now also at NIST, JILA, PTB);\n\u2022 accurate measurement of the 1s \u2212 2s transition (done at MPQ [3] with\nan accuracy compatible with any other optical transition but not yet\ncompetitive with cesium and rubidium fountain clocks);\n\u2022 proper QED theory of the Lamb shift (essentially developed within the\nlast decades but it still needs more progress);\n\u2022 determination of the proton charge radius (not known with sufficient\naccuracy, but a promising experiment is in progress [25]).\nThe hydrogen atom was a candidate for the primary frequency standard in\nthe 1960ies because of the hyperfine splitting, but this attempt failed for a\nnumber of reasons. Now it is time for a strong competition of new frequency\nstandards and the hydrogen atom has its second chance.\nActually there is one more fundamental constant, which is associated with\nthe optical measurements. That is the speed of light which is equal to\nc = 299 792 458 m/s\n\n(2)\n\nbecause of the definition of the meter . Despite this constant is fixed by definition there is still an uncertainty related to a practical realization of the\nmeter . The problem is that the second is defined with the help of the cesium hyperfine transition, while the meter is related to the optical domain.\nThe accepted recommendations for its realization is based on optical transitions [26]. In the case of any direct application of (2) one meets three sources\nof uncertainty\n\u2022 a realization of the second in the microwave domain;\n\u2022 a realization of the meter in the optical domain;\n\u2022 a bridge between both realizations to the same transition (i.e. the frequency chain).\nAfter recent progress in frequency chain metrology and a long-term development of the microwave standards, present-day limitations come mainly from\nthe optical standards, which however are developing in a very promising way.\nThe old-fashion frequency chains, which really presented the state of art\nin the field just few years ago, appear now as some kind of dinosaur, which\nshould very soon disappear. Those chains are much bigger, much more expensive, much more complicated in construction and in use and at the same\ntime less accurate, than the new frequency-comb chains. The main disadvantage of the old technology was a limited possibility in use. The old chains\nwere designed as a single-problem chain and it was necessary to redesign it\n\n\f10\n\nSavely G. Karshenboim\n\nwith adding some more items to adjust it to new transitions. The new chain\nprovides us with a possibility to measure any optical transitions and some\nmeasurements like the cesium D1 line for example needed for the determination of the fine structure constant [17] are now a routine problem. The chain\noffers new horizons for precision optical spectroscopy and we look forward for\nsoon reproductions of recent experiments [3,20,22] which must deliver new\nsecure limitations for a possible variation of the fine structure constant with\ntime on a level of 10\u221214 per year.\n\nAcknowledgement\nI met Ted H\u00e4nsch for the first time at ICAP'94 and became a frequent visitor\nto the MPQ. I have been always impressed by the free and fruitful atmosphere\nof his lab. Starting as a pure theorist I am now trying to be between theory\nand experiment and I enjoyed lots of discussions with Ted H\u00e4nsch and his\ncollaborators, which were really stimulating. During the 8 years around the\nMPQ, a highlight of our cooperation certainly was the organization of the\nHydrogen Atom, 2 meeting [8], in which both of us were involved. I was\nalways feeling his support without which the project could not be realized.\nPersonally, he did only a few adjustments. But those were the crucial things\nthat I had missed, and that was one more chance to see how efficient he is. I\ndo really wish to thank him for the support and hospitality he extended in\nGarching and especially in Florence.\n\nReferences\n1. F. Biraben and L. Julien, this volume\n2. M. Weitz, A. Huber, F.
