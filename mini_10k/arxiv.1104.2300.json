Introduction\nThe existence of a broad-band X-ray/soft gamma-ray spectra of accreting black holes in binary\nsystems strongly suggest the presence of a very hot plasma (corona) around the central object.\nThe soft X-ray photons produced in the inner accretion disk are Comptonized by the corona [1]\nproducing a power-law, high-energy feature in the spectrum.\nThe effects of a non-thermal population of electrons in a hot corona were considered by\nKunusose & Mineshige [2] and more recently by Belmont et al. [3] and Vurm & Poutanen [4].\nRomero et al. [5] have studied the case of a steady state magnetized corona with injection of both\nrelativistic electrons and protons. In the present work we extend the latter work to time-dependent\ninjection and calculate the expected electromagnetic emission during a transient event in a hot magnetized corona around a galactic black hole. We also study the absorbing effect of an anisotropic\nphoton-field, provided by the companion star.\nThis paper is motivated by the recent detections of very high energy emission from several\nX-ray binaries. For example, the detection of the well known source Cygnus X-1 during a flare\nepisode constitutes the first putative evidence of very high-energy gamma-ray emission produced\naround galactic black hole [6]. More recently, the flaring nature of Cyg X-1 in gamma rays has\nbeen confirmed with the AGILE satellite [7]. In addition, four gamma-ray flares were detected by\nAGILE satellite from the X-ray binary Cygnus X-3 [8]. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)\nhas also detected a variable high-energy source coinciding with the position of Cyg X-3 [9].\nHere, we apply our model to the X-ray binary Cyg X-1.\n\n2. Steady state model\nWe consider a spherical corona with a radius Rc = 35Rg , and a luminosity of 1 % of the\nEddington luminosity of a 10M\u2299 black hole. Since the corona is in steady state, by considering\nequipartition of energy we can estimate the values of magnetic field and plasma density, which\nresult in B = 5.7 \u00d7 105 G and ne \u223c ni = 6.2 \u00d7 1013 cm\u22123 , respectively. It is assumed that the corona\nis composed of a two-temperature plasma, with an electron temperature Te = 109 K and an ion\ntemperature Ti = 1012 K (e.g., [10],[11]). The X-ray emission of the corona is characterized by a\npowerlaw with an exponential cut-off at high energies.\nWe consider an static corona where relativistic particles can be removed by diffusion. In the\nBohm regime, the diffusion coefficient is D(E) = rg c/3, where rg = E/(eB) is the gyro-radius of\nthe particle.\nFor further details on the static corona model we refer the reader to [5].\nIn this scenario it is expected that relativistic particles lose energy mainly because of synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, for electrons and muons, whereas for protons\nand charged pion the relevant cooling processes are synchrotron radiation, inellastic proton-proton\ncollisions, and photomeson production. Figure (1) shows the cooling time for different radiative\nprocesses together with the diffusion rate for primary particles.\n2.1 Spectral energy distribution\nWe study the effect of the injection of a power-law distribution of relativistic electrons and pro2\n\n\fGamma-ray flares from black hole coronae\n\n9\n\n5\np+\n\nBremsstrahlung\n\n8\n7\n\np+p\n\n4\n\nIC\n\nSynchrotron\n\nSynchrotron\nAcceleration rate\n\n6\n\nAcceleration rate\n\n3\n\nDiffusive rate\n\nDiffusive rate\n\n-1\n\n/ s )\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n4\n3\n\n1\n\nLog (t\n\nLog (t\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n/ s )\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n-1\n\n-1\n-2\n-2\n-3\n\n-3\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nLog (Ee / eV)\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\nLog (Ep / eV)\n\n(a) Electron losses.\n\n(b) Proton losses.\n\nFigure 1: Radiative losses in the static corona previously described [5].\n\ntons. The main products of hadronic interactions are charged pions, which then decay producing\nmuons and neutrinos. Neutral pions yield gamma-rays, that are a source of secondary pairs. Therefore, we also include the effect of the presence of all these secondary particles in our treatment. We\nsolve the transport equation in steady state obtaining particle distributions for the different species.\n2.1.1 Internal absorption\nGamma-rays produced in the corona can be absorbed by different mechanisms. The most relevant mechanism in this scenario is photon-photon annihilation. The absorption can be quantified\nby the absorption coefficient or opacity \u03c4 . In Fig. (2) we show the opacity due to the interaction\nbetween gamma-rays and thermal X-ray photons from the corona, which are by far the dominant\nelectromagnetic component.\n175\nr = 0.1 Rc\n\n150\n\nr = 0.25 Rc\nr = 0.5 Rc\nr = Rc\n\n125\n100\n75\n50\n25\n0\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\nLog (E\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n/ eV)\n\nFigure 2: Internal absorption due to photon-photon pair production.\n\nBecause of the high values of the opacity, it is expected a great number of secondary pairs to\nbe created. The effects of internal absorption and the radiation emitted by secondary pairs are also\ninclude in the final SED, which is shown in Fig. (3). This figure also shows the spectrum of the\nwell-known source Cygnus X-1, detected by COMPTEL [12] and INTEGRAL [13].\n3\n\n\fGamma-ray flares from black hole coronae\n\n38\nStatic corona model\nCygnus X-1\n\n37\n\nCTA\nMAGIC\nFermi\n\nLog (L\n\n-1\n\n/ erg s )\n\n36\n\n35\n\n34\n\n33\n\n32\n\n31\n\n30\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nLog (E\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n/ eV)\n\nFigure 3: Spectral energy distribution obtained with the steady state model of a static corona. The prediction\nfits the observation made by COMPTEL and INTEGRAL of Cygnus X-1 ([12, 13]).\n\n2.1.2 Gamma-ray opacity due to photopair-production in the stellar radiation field\nThe binary system Cygnus X-1 is composed by a massive star and a compact object. The\nmassive star is an O9.7 Iab of 40 \u00b1 10M\u2299 [14]. The orbit of the system is circular, with a period of\n5.6 days and an inclination between 25\u25e6 and 65\u25e6 [15].\nThe star provides an intense radiation field that can absorb gamma-rays by pair creation within\nthe binary system. The photon field provided by the star is anisotropic, because it depends on the\nposition of the black hole in its orbit (see Fig. 4). We consider the opacity treatment for gamma-ray\nabsorption in Cygnus X-1 as in [16].\nThe star has a radius R\u2217 = 1.5 \u00d7 1012 cm, and for simplicity we asume a blackbody density\nradiation of a temperature T\u2217 = 3 \u00d7 104 K. The orbital radius is rorb = 3.4 \u00d7 1012 cm. The value of\nthe orbital phase \u03c6 = 0 corresponds to the compact object at opposition (Fig. 4).\nIn Fig. (5) we show the gamma-ray emission of the corona in steady state at a given energy.\nThe modulation is due to the photon absorption in the stellar field.\n\n3. Flare model\nThe temporal dependence of the particle injection is characterized by a FRED (Fast Rise and\nExponential Decay) behavior, whereas the energy dependence is a power-law. The transient injection can be represented by [17]\nQ(E,t) = Q0 E\n\n\u2212\u03b1 \u2212E/Emax\n\ne\n\nt/\u03c4rise\n\n(1 \u2212 e\n\n4\n\n\u0010 t \u2212 \u03c4 \u0011\u0015\n\u03c0\nplat\n)\n\u2212 arctan\n,\n2\n\u03c4dec\n\u0014\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fGamma-ray flares from black hole coronae\n\nFigure 4: Sketch of the geometry considered for the gamma-ray absorption in the stellar photon field [16].\n35\n\n30\n\nLog (L\n\n-1\n\n/ erg s )\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nOrbital Phase [degree]\n\nFigure 5: Modulation of gamma-ray emission in steady state at E \u223c 50 GeV by the anisotropic photon field\nof the companion star.\n\nwhere \u03c4rise = 30min , \u03c4dec = 1h and \u03c4plat = 2h . The power-law has the standard index of \u03b1 = 2.2. The\nnormalization constant Q0 can be obtained from the total power injected in relativistic protons and\nelectrons, Lrel = L p + Le . This power is assumed to be a fraction of the luminosity of the corona,\nLrel = qrel Lc . In the steady state the best fit to the observations is obtained with qrel = 0.2. During\nthe flare the number of relativistic particles increases. In our model, the power injected in the flare\ndoubles of that injected in steady state.\nIn order to obtain the evolution of particle distributions N(E,t) for each type of particle, we\nsolve the transport equation given by [18]\n\u0011 N(E,t)\n\u2202 N(E,t)\n\u2202 \u0010\nb(E)N(E,t) +\n+\n= Q(E,t).\n\u2202t\n\u2202E\ntesc\nwhere b(E) =\n\ndE\ndt loss .\n\n5\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fGamma-ray flares from black hole coronae\n\nFig. (6) shows the evolution of the electromagnetic emission during a day, not corrected by\nthe absorption in the photon field of the star. For this purpose, in Fig. (7) we show the absorption\ncoefficient due to the stellar field. We estimate the opacity for flares occurring at different orbital\nphases, and we conclude that for some values of \u03c6 the absorption of the star is almost negligible.\n38\n\nt = 1 h\nt = 6 h\nt = 24 h\n\nLog (L\n\n-1\n\n/ erg s )\n\n36\n\n34\n\n32\n\n30\n\n28\n\n26\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nLog (E\n\n/ eV)\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nFigure 6: Evolution of the luminosity during the flare, without consider the absorption due to the star.\n\n4. Summary and conclusions\nWe have estimated the electromagnetic output produced in the corona during a transient outburst. Our study is based on a steady state model of an accreting black hole, which is in agreement\nwith the observations of Cygnus X-1 [5]. We consider both internal and external absorption. We\nhave included the effect of the presence of an anisotropic stellar photon-field. The absorption\nproduced by this field results almost negligible for certain positions of the compact objects; nevertheless it affects the electromagnetic emission at E \u223c 30 GeV for the most of the orbit.\nIn a future work, we will study the modulation in the emission for objects in which the orbital\nperiod is comparable with the flare duration.\n\nReferences\n[1] Shakura, N.
