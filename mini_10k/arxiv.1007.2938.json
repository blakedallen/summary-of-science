A general evolutionary mechanism based on global stability has been\nproposed recently [J I Perotti, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 108701 (2009)]. This mechanism was incorporated into a model of a growing network of interacting agents in which\neach new agent's membership in the network is determined by the agent's effect on the\nnetwork's global stability. In this work, we analyze different quantities that characterize\nthe topology of the emerging networks, such as global connectivity, clustering and average\nnearest neighbors degree, showing that they reproduce scaling behaviors frequently observed in several biological systems. The influence of the stability selection mechanism on\nthe dynamics associated to the resulting network, as well as the interplay between some\ntopological and functional features are also analyzed.\n\nI.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concept of networks of interacting agents has\nproven, in the last decade, to be a powerful tool\nin the analysis of complex systems (for reviews,\nsee Refs. [1-4]). Although not new, with the advent of high performance computing, this theoretical construction opened a new door for the statistical physics methodology in the analysis of systems\ncomposed by a large number of units that interact\nin a complicated way. This allowed to get new insights about the dynamical behavior of systems as\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\njuanpool@gmail.com\nbilloni@famaf.unc.edu.ar\n\u2021 E-mail: tamarit@famaf.unc.edu.ar\n\u00a7 E-mail: cannas@famaf.unc.edu.ar\n\u2020 E-mail:\n\n1\n\nFacultad de Matem\u00e1tica, Astronom\u0131\u0301a y F\u0131\u0301sica, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.\n\n2\n\nInstituto de F\u0131\u0301sica Enrique Gaviola (IFEG-CONICET),\nCiudad Universitaria, 5000 C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.\n\ncomplex as biological and social systems. In addition, it constitutes a basic backbone upon which\nrelatively simple models can be constructed in a\nbottom-up strategy.\nAs a modeling tool, the definition of an interaction network for a given system is frequently not\nunique (see for example the case of protein-protein\ninteraction networks [5-7]), depending on the coarse\ngrain level of the approach. Nevertheless, many\ntopological properties appear to be independent of\nthe definition of the network. Moreover, some of\nthose properties have emerged in the last years as\nuniversal features among systems otherwise considered very different from each other. In particular,\nthe following properties are characteristic of most\nbiological networks. (a) Small worldness: all of\nthem exhibit high clustering Cc and relatively short\npath length L, compared with random networks. L\nis defined as the minimum number of links needed\nto connect any pair of nodes in the network and Cc\nis defined as the fraction of connections between\n\n020005-1\n\n\fPapers in Physics, vol. 2, art. 020005 (2010) / J. I. Perotti et al.\ntopological neighbors of any site[1]. (b) Scale free\ndegree distribution: the degree distribution P (k)\n(the probability of a node to be connected to k\nother ones) presents a broad tail for large values\nof k. In some cases, the tail can be approached\nby a power law P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 with degree exponents\n\u03b3 < 3 for a wide range of scales, while in others, a\ncutoff appears for some maximum degree kmax ; in\nthe latter, the degree distribution is generally well\ndescribed by P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 e\u2212k/kmax [1, 7-12]. In\nany case, the networks present a nonhomogeneous\nstructure, very different from that expected in a\nrandom network. (c) Scaling of the clustering coefficient : in many natural networks, it is observed\nthat the clustering coefficient of a node with degree\nk follows the scaling law Cc(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b2 , with \u03b2 taking values close to one. This has been interpreted\nas an evidence for a modular structure organized in\na hierarchical way [13]. (d) Disassortative mixing\nby degree: in most biological networks, highly connected nodes tend to be preferentially connected to\nnodes with low degree and vice versa [14].\nThese properties are observed for a wide range\nof scales, from the microscopic level of genetic,\nmetabolic and proteins networks to the macroscopic level of communities of living beings (ecological networks). Such ubiquity suggests the existence of some natural selection process that promotes the development of those particular structures [3]. One possible constraint general enough\nto act across such a range of scales is the proper\nstability of the underlying dynamics.\nGrowing biological networks involve the coupling\nof at least two dynamical processes. The first one\nconcerns the addition of new nodes, attached during a slow evolutionary (i.e., species lifetime) process. A second one is the node dynamics which\naffects and in turn is affected by the growing processes. It is reasonable to expect that the network\ntopologies we finally witness could have emerged\nout of these coupled processes. Consider, for example, the case of an ecological network like a food\nweb, where nodes are species within an ecosystem\nand edges are consumer-resource relationships between them. New nodes are added during evolutionary time scales, through speciation or migration of new species. Then, the network grows\nthrough community assembly rules, strongly influenced by the underlying dynamics of species and\nspecific interactions among them [15, 16]. The con-\n\nsequence of adding a new member with a given\nconnectivity affecting a global in/stability, is represented in this case by the aboundance/lack of food\n[17]. Notice that each new member may not only\nresult in its own addition/rejection to the system,\nbut it can also promote avalanches of extinctions\namongst existing members.\nThe above ingredients were recently incorporated\ninto a simple model of growing networks under stability constraints [19]. Numerical simulations on\nthis model showed that, indeed, complex topology\ncan emerge out of a stability selection pressure.\nIn the present work, we further explore different\ntopological and dynamical properties predicted by\nthe model, whose definition is reviewed in section\nII. The results are presented in sections III. and\nIV. In section III., we analyze the topological features that emerge in growing networks under stability constraint. In section IV., we show that this\nconstraint not only induces topological features of\nthe resulting networks but also influences the associated dynamics. A discussion of the results is\npresented in section V.\n\nII.\n\nThe Model\n\nLet us consider a system of n interactive agents,\nwhose dynamics is given by a set of differential equations d~x/dt = F~ (~x), where ~x is an ncomponent vector describing the relevant state\nvariables of each agent and F~ is an arbitrary nonlinear function. One could imagine that ~x in different systems may represent concentrations of some\nhormones, the average density populations in a\nfood web, the concentration of chemicals in a biochemical network, or the activity of genes in a gene\nregulation net, etc. We assume that a given agent\ni interacts only with a limited set of ki < n other\nagents; thus, Fi depends only on the variables belonging to that set. This defines the interaction\nnetwork.\nWe assume that there are two time scales in the\ndynamics. Let fm be the average frequency of the\nincoming flux of new agents (migration, mutation,\n\u22121\netc.). This defines a characteristic time \u03c4m = fm\n.\nOn the long time scale t \u226b \u03c4m (much larger than\nthe observation time) new agents arrive to the system and start to interact with some of the previous\nones. Some of them can be incorporated into the\n\n020005-2\n\n\fPapers in Physics, vol. 2, art. 020005 (2010) / J. I. Perotti et al.\nsystem or not, so n (and the whole set of differential\nequations) can change. Once a new agent starts to\ninteract with the system, we will assume that the\nenlarged system evolves towards some stationary\nstate with characteristic relaxation time \u03c4rel \u226a \u03c4m .\nThen, in the short time scale \u03c4rel \u226a t \u226a \u03c4m we\ncan assume that n is constant and the dynamics\nalready led the system to a particular stable stationary state ~x\u2217 defined by F~ (~x\u2217 ) = 0. Following\nMay's ideas [18], we assume that the only attractors\nof the dynamics are fixed points. Nevertheless, the\nproposed mechanism is expected to work, as well,\nfor more complex attractors (e.g, limit cycles).\nThe stability of the solution ~x\u2217 is determined by\nthe eigenvalue with maximum real part of the Jacobian matrix\nai,j \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202Fi\n\u2202xj\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\n~\nx\u2217\n\nA new agent will be incorporated to the network\nif its inclusion results in a new stable fixed point,\nthat is, if the values of the interaction matrix ai,j\nare such that the eigenvalue with maximum real\npart \u03bbm of the enlarged Jacobian matrix is negative (\u03bbm < 0). Assuming that isolated agents will\nreach stable states by themselves after certain characteristic relaxation time, the diagonal elements of\nthe matrix ai,i are negative and given unity value\nto further simplify the treatment [18]. The interaction values, (i.e., the non-diagonal matrix elements ai,j ) will take random values (both positive\nand negative) taken from some statistical distribution. In this way, we have an unbounded ensemble of systems [18] characterized by a \"growing\nthrough stability\" history. Randomness would be\nself-generated through the addition of new agents\nprocesses. Each specific set of matrix elements, after addition, defines a particular dynamical system\nand the subsequent analysis for time scales between\nsuccessive migrations is purely deterministic.\nThe model is then defined by the following algorithm [19]. At every step, the network can either\ngrow or shrink. In each step, an attempt is made\nto add a new node to the existing network, starting\nfrom a single agent (n = 1). Based on the stability\ncriteria already discussed, the attempt can be successful or not. If successful, the agent is accepted,\nso the existing n \u00d7 n matrix grows its size by one\ncolumn and one row. Otherwise, the novate agent\n\nwill have a probability to be deleted together with\nsome other nodes, as further explained below.\nMore specifically, suppose that we have an already created network with n nodes, such that the\nn \u00d7 n associated interaction matrix ai,j is stable.\nThen, for the attachment of the (n + 1)th node,\nwe first choose its degree kn+1 randomly between\n1 and n with equal probability. Then, the new\nagent interaction with the existing network member\ni is chosen, such that non-diagonal matrix elements\n(ai,n+1 , an+1,i ) (i = 1, . . . , n) are zero with probability 1\u2212kn+1 /n and different from zero with probability kn+1 /n; to each non\u2013zero matrix element\nwe assign a different real random value uniformly\ndistributed in [\u2212b, b]. b determines the interaction\nrange variability and it is one of the two parameters\nof the model [20].\nThen, we calculate numerically \u03bbm for the resulting (n + 1) \u00d7 (n + 1) matrix. If \u03bbm < 0, the new\nnode is accepted. If \u03bbm > 0, it means that the\nintroduction of the new node destabilized the entire system and we will impose that, the new agent\nis either eliminated or it remains but produces the\nextinction of a certain number of previous existing\nagents. In order to further simplify the numerical\ntreatment, we allow up to q \u2264 kn+1 extinctions,\ntaken from the set of kn+1 nodes connected to the\nnew one; q is the other parameter of the model. To\nchoose which nodes are to be eliminated, we first\nselect one with equal probability in the set of kn+1\nand remove it. If the resulting n \u00d7 n matrix is stable, we start a new trial; otherwise, another node\namong the remaining kn+1 \u2212 1 is chosen and removed, repeating the previous procedure. If after\nq removals the matrix remains unstable, the new\nnode is removed (we return to the original n \u00d7 n\nmatrix and start a new trial). The process is repeated until the network reaches a maximum size\nn = nmax (typically nmax = 200) and restarted M\ntimes from n = 1 to obtain statistics of the networks (typically M = 105 ).\n\nIII.\ni.\n\nTopological properties\n\nConnectivity\n\nFirst, we analyzed the average connectivity C(n),\ndefined as the fraction of non-diagonal matrix elements different from zero, averaged over different\nruns.

The average clustering\ncoefficient decays with the network size as Cc(n) \u223c\nn\u22120.75 (which is slower than the 1/n decay in a\nrandom net), while the average path length L between two nodes increases as L(n) \u223c A ln (n + C)\n[19]. A similar behavior is observed in the BarabasiAlbert model [1], where the clustering can be approximated by a power law with the same exponent,\nalthough the exact scaling is [27] Cc(n) \u223c (ln n)2 /n\n(therefore that behavior cannot be excluded in the\npresent model). While this suggests the presence of\nan underlying preferential attachment rule mechanism, a detailed analysis has shown that this is not\nthe dominant mechanism [19]. The behavior of Cc\nand L is linked with the selection dynamics ruling\nwhich node is accepted or rejected. The stability\nconstraint favors the nodes with few links, since\nthey modify the matrix ai,j stability much less than\nnew nodes with many links (of course this is reflected in the P (k) density). Thus, most frequently,\n\nthe network grows at the expense of adding nodes\nwith one or few links, producing an increase of L\nand a decrease of Cc, but sporadically, a highly connected node is accepted, decreasing L and increasing Cc(n) [19]. Those fluctuations lead to a slow\ndiffusive-like growth of the network size n(t) \u223c t1/2\n(See Fig. 4).\nAnother quantity of interest is the average clustering Cc(k) as a function of the degree k. A typical\nexample is shown in Fig. 5. We see that Cc(k) decreases monotonously with k and displays a power\nlaw tail Cc(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b2 with an exponent \u03b2 \u2248 0.9,\nclose to one. The exponent appears to be completely independent of b and q. This behavior is\nindicative of a modular structure with hierarchical\norganization [13]. Notice that this power law decay appears for degrees k > 20, precisely the same\nrange of values for which the degree distribution\nP (k) displays a power law tail (see subsection ii.).\niv.\n\nMixing by degree patterns\n\nTo analyze the mixing by degree properties of the\nnetworks selected by the stability constraint, we\ncalculated the average degree knn among the nearest neighbors of a node with degree k. In Fig. 6, we\nsee that knn decays with a power law knn \u223c k \u2212\u03b4\nfor k > 20, with an exponent \u03b4 close to \u22120.25, in\na clear disassortative behavior. This result is also\nconsistent with previous works showing that assor-\n\n020005-5\n\n\fPapers in Physics, vol. 2, art. 020005 (2010) / J. I.

We now analyze the\ncharacteristics of the dynamics associated to the\nnetworks emerging from such constraint. In other\nwords, we investigate the statistics of values of the\nnon null elements aij 6= 0.\nFirst of all, we calculate the probability distribution of values for a single non null matrix element\naij of the final network with size n = nmax . The\ntypical behavior is shown in Fig. 7. We see that\nP (aij ) is an even function, almost uniform in the\ninterval [\u2212b, b], with a small cusp around aij = 0.\nThis shows that stability is not enhanced by a particular sign or absolute value of the individual interaction coefficients. It has been shown recently\nthat the presence of anticorrelated links between\npairs of nodes (i.e., links between pairs of nodes\n(i, j) such that sign(aij ) = \u2212sign(aji )) significa-\n\nFigure 7: Probability density of the matrix elements aij for b = 2, q = 3 and nmax = 100.\n\ntively enhances the stability of random matrices\n[31]. In an ecological network, this typically corresponds to a predator-prey or parasite-host interaction. To check for the presence of such type of\ninteractions, we calculated the correlation haij aji i,\nwhere the average is taken over pairs of nodes with\na double link (aij 6= 0 and aji 6= 0).\nIn Fig. 8, we show haij aji i as a function of the\nnetwork size n. We see that this correlation is negative for any value of n and saturates into a value\nhaij aji i \u2248 \u22120.65 for large values of n. In the in-\n\n020005-6\n\n\fPapers in Physics, vol. 2, art. 020005 (2010) / J. I. Perotti et al.\n\nFigure 8: Correlation function haij aji i between a\npair of nodes (i, j) with a double link as a function\nof the network size, for b = 2 and q = 3. The average was calculated over all pair of sites with double link in networks with the same size. The inset\nshows a comparison between the fraction of double\nlinks in the present network h\u03b7i (green circles) and\na random network of the same size and connectivity\nC(n): h\u03b7iran = C/(2 \u2212 C) (continuous line). Yellow triangles correspond to a numerical calculation\nof h\u03b7iran . The dashed line corresponds to a power\nlaw n\u22120.68 .\n\nset of Fig. 8, we compare the average fraction of\ndouble links h\u03b7i with the corresponding quantity\nfor a completely random network with the same\nconnectivity C(n), that is, a network where all\nedges are independently distributed with probability P (aij 6= 0) = C(n). Then, the probability of\nhaving a link between an arbitrary pair of sites is\npd = C(n)(2 \u2212 C(n)) and the average degree per\nnode hki = pd n. Hence\n\nh\u03b7iran =\n\nC(n)\nC 2 (n) n\n=\nhki\n2 \u2212 C(n)\n\n(3)\n\nThen for large values of n, we have h\u03b7iran \u223c C(n) \u223c\nn\u2212(1+\u01eb) . From the inset of Fig. 8, we see that\nh\u03b7i \u223c n\u22120.68 when n \u226b 1 in the present case. The\nfraction of double links is considerable larger than\nin a random network. The two results of Fig. 8 together show that the present networks have indeed\na significantly large number of anticorrelated pair\ninteractions.\nNext,\nwe\ncalculated\nthe\ncorrelation\n\nFigure 9: Correlation function haij aji i/h|aij |i2 between the matrix elements linking a node i and its\nneighbors j as a function of its degree ki , for b = 2,\nq = 3 and different values of nmax . The inset shows\nthe average fraction of anticorrelated links h\u03bai as a\nfunction of ki .\n\nhaij aji i/h|aij |i2 between the matrix elements,\nlinking a node i and its neighbors j, as a function\nof its degree ki , where the average is taken only\non the double links. From Fig. 9, we see that\nthe absolute value of the correlation presents a\nmaximum around ki = 25 and tends to zero as the\ndegree increases. The inset of Fig. 9 shows that the\naverage fraction of anticorrelated links h\u03bai (i.e.,\n# anticorrelated links/total # double links) tends\nto 1/2 as the degree increases. We can conclude\nfrom these results that the interactions strengths\nbetween the hubs and their neighbors are almost\nuncorrelated. This suggests that the influence of\nhubs in the stabilization of the dynamics is mainly\nassociated to their topological role (e.g., reduction\nof the average length L) rather than to the nature\nof their associated interactions.\n\nV.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe recent advances in the research on networks\ntheory in biological systems have called for a deeper\nunderstanding about the relationship between network structure and function, based on evolutionary\ngrounds [3]. In this work, we have shown that a\nkey factor to explain the emergency of many of the\ncomplex topological features commonly observed in\n\n020005-7\n\n\fPapers in Physics, vol. 2, art. 020005 (2010) / J. I. Perotti et al.\nbiological networks could be just the stability of the\nunderlying dynamics. Stability can then be considered as an effective fitness acting in all biological\nsituations. The results presented in Fig. 2 for the\nconnectivity of real biological networks at different\nnetwork size scales support this conclusion. In addition, the present approach (although based on a\nvery simple model) allows to draw some conclusions\nabout the interplay between network structure and\nfunction that could be of general applicability. The\npresent results suggest that hubs play mainly a\ntopological role of linking modules (disassortativity, low clustering, uncorrelated links), while low\nconnected nodes inside modules enhance stability\nthrough the presence of many anticorrelated interactions.\nThe stabilizing effects of some of the topological\nand functional network features here analyzed have\nbeen previously addressed separately (small world\n[32], dissasortative mixing [29, 30], anticorrelated\ninteractions [31]). However, the present analysis\nsuggests that the simultaneous observance of all of\nthem is highly unlikely to be a result of a purely\nrandom process. Such delicate balance of specific\ntopological and functional features would only be\nattainable through a slow, evolutionary stability selection process.\nIn particular, the above scenario agrees very well\nwith the observed structures in cellular networks.\nFor instance, the scaling behavior of Cc(k), displayed in Fig. 5, has been observed in metabolic\n[28] and protein [6, 7] networks. Disassortative\nmixing by degree is another ubiquous property of\nthose systems and indeed a very similar behavior\nto that shown in Fig. 6 has been observed in certain protein-protein interaction networks [7]. Also,\nthe available data for the degree distribution in all\nthose cases are consistent with a power law behavior with an exponent \u03b3 between 2 and 2.5 [1]. The\nagreement with the whole set of properties predicted by the model suggests that stability could\nbe a key evolutionary factor in the development of\ncellular networks.\nThe situation is a bit different in the case of ecological networks, where the predictions of the model\ndo not completely agree with the observations, specially those related to food webs. On the one hand,\nfood webs usually display also disassortative mixing by degree, modularity and relatively low small\nworldness [33] (rather low values of clustering, com-\n\npared with other biological networks), in agreement\nwith the present predictions. Regarding the scaling behavior of C(n) [24], this is the topic of an old\ndebate in ecology (see Dunne's review in Ref. [23]\nfor a summary of the debate). While in general\nit is expected a power law behavior, the value of\nthe exponent (and the associated interpretations)\nis controversial, due to the large dispersion of the\navailable data, the rather small range of network\nsizes available and, in some cases, the low resolution of the data [25]. The consistency of the scaling shown in Fig. 2 for a broad range of size scales\nsuggests that the ecological debate should be reconsidered in a broader context of evolutionary growth\nunder stability constraints.\nOn the other hand, the degree distribution of\nfood webs is not always a power law, but it frequently exhibits an exponential cutoff at some maximum characteristic degree kmax [9, 10]. Such variance between food webs and other biological networks is probably related to the way ecosystems\nassemble and evolve compared with other systems.\nWhile the hypothesis of the present model are general enough to apply in principle to any biological\nsystem, that difference suggests that stability is not\nenough to explain the observed structures in food\nwebs, but further constraints should be included\nto account for them. For instance, at least two\ndifferent (although closely related) constraints are\nknown that can generate a cutoff in the degree distribution: aging and limited capacity of the nodes\n[34]. In the former, nodes can become inactive with\nsome probability through time (in the sense that\nthey stop interacting with new agents), while in\nthe latter they systematically pay a \"cost\" every\ntime a new link is established with them, so that\nthey become inactive when some maximum degree\nis reached. One can easily imagine different situations in which mechanisms of that type become\nimportant in the evolution of ecological webs, either by limitations in the available resources or by\ndynamical changes in the diet of species due to external perturbations (for instance, there are many\nfactors that constrain a predator's diet; see Ref.\n[9] and references therein for a related discussion).\nMechanisms of these kind can be easily incorporated into the model, serving as a base for the description of more complex behaviors in particular\nsystems like food webs.\nFinally, it would be interesting to analyze the\n\n020005-8\n\n\fPapers in Physics, vol. 2, art. 020005 (2010) / J.
