The making of magnetic- and electric-dipolar BEC may also be\nexpected, respectively, in erbium [5] and in molecular\ngases [6]. An updated review of this rapidly progressing\nfield was given in Ref. [7].\nOne of the promising possibilities, which has been,\nthus far, investigated only theoretically, is the creation of\nbright solitons in dipolar condensates. This can be easily\npredicted in various one-dimensional (1D) settings, using, in particular, periodic potentials induced by optical\nlattices as the stabilizing factor [8]. In the limit of a very\ndeep lattice, the BEC wave function becomes nearly discrete, which makes it possible to predict stable 2D dipolar\nsolitons [9] and vortices [10], as well as 3D solitons [11],\nin the (quasi-)discrete form.\nAs concerns solitons, the most challenging issue is the\ncreation of such stable matter-wave modes in quasi-2D\n(pancake-shaped) condensates, as well as their counterparts in the form of spatiotemporal solitons in optics. In\nspite of intensive theoretical discussions [12], no experimental results in this area have been reported thus far,\nthe most essential obstacle being the inherent instability\nof 2D solitons to the collapse, driven by the self-focusing\ncubic nonlinearity (very recently, it was proposed to create stable bright solitons by means of self-defocusing nonlinearity, which is possible in a rather exotic situation\nwith the strength of the nonlinearity growing at r \u2192 \u221e\nfaster than rD , where D is the spatial dimension [13]).\n\nThe dipolar condensates suggest new challenges and possibilities for achieving this fundamental purpose, by making use of the competition between local interactions and\nlong-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs). A quasi-2D\nisotropic configuration implies that the local moments are\npolarized perpendicular to the pancake's plane, in which\ncase the DDI is repulsive. In that case, the creation of\n(bright) 2D solitons may be possible if the sign of the DDI\nis effectively reversed by means of a rapidly oscillating\nmagnetic field [14]; in the same setting, stable isotropic\nsolitons with embedded vorticity were predicted too [15],\nand various 2D localized structures may be stabilized by\ntrapping potentials acting in the plane [16]. The very fact\nof the existence of multidimensional solitons in the dipolar BEC can be proven in a rigorous mathematical form\n[17]. It is also relevant to mention that stable isotropic\nsolitons are possible in optical media with nonlocal (thermal or orientational) nonlinearities, as was demonstrated\nexperimentally [18], and studied in detail theoretically\n[19].\nThe most challenging issue, which is unique to the multidimensional dipolar media, is the possibility of the creation of a new species of anisotropic solitons, based on\nthe in-plane polarization of local moments (obviously, the\nanisotropy cannot manifest itself in 1D solitons). The\nstationary form of such quasi-2D solitons, and some of\ntheir dynamical properties, were investigated in Refs.\n[20, 21], but the problem of the actual creation of the\nsolitons under experimentally relevant conditions has not\nbeen addressed before. The complex anisotropic structure expected in the solitons makes this problem crucially\nimportant, as the mode may be considered physically robust only if it is capable to self-trap from experimentally\nfeasible initial configurations. In this work, we show, by\nmeans of systematic simulations of a realistic model, that\n\n\f2\nanisotropic solitons in dipolar BEC can be created, using available experimental techniques. This result may\nhave more general implications, suggesting the realizability of various complex modes predicted in multidimensional quantum gases, such as skyrmions [22].\nAs mentioned above, there are currently two atomic\nspecies available for creating magnetic dipolar BEC, viz.,\n52\nCr and 164 Dy. Since the latter has been condensed\nvery lately [4], our main results refer to chromium, but\nat the end of this work we address dysprosium too.\nThe making of the anisotropic solitons is possible in a\nstrongly dipolar regime, which may be defined by the\ndimensionless ratio of the DDI and local interaction,\n\u01ebDD = m\u03bc0 \u03bc2 /(12\u03c0ah\u03042 ). Here, m is the atom's mass,\n\u03bc0 the free-space permeability, \u03bc the atom's magnetic\nmoment, and a the s-wave scattering length. As shown\nin Ref. [20], the necessary condition for the existence of\nsolitons is \u01ebDD > 1. In the case of 52 Cr, the natural\nvalue of this ratio is \u01ebDD \u2248 0.16 [23]. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to tune the scattering length to enhance the\nrelative strength of the DDI, which may be accomplished\nby using the Feshbach resonance [24, 25]. For 52 Cr, we\nthus find that the critical scattering length below which\nthe 2D solitons can exist is 15 aB . However, this condition is not sufficient, as it is only an upper bound, and\nthe soliton may actually be found at still smaller values of a [21]. On the other hand, if a is too small, i.e.\n\u01ebDD exceeds a certain critical value, the condensate will\ncollapse. Therefore, solitons only exist within a certain\nrange of values of the scattering length. For typical trap\nfrequencies and numbers of atoms in the condensate, the\nrelevant range for chromium is in a ballpark of 4 aB [21].\nTo explore conditions for the creation of the anisotropic\nsolitons, we consider BEC of N atoms with magnetic\ndipole moment \u03bc, which are fully polarized by means of\nan external uniform magnetic field. At a sufficiently low\ntemperature, the dynamics of the condensate obey the\nextended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE):\nh\ni\n\u01250 (t) + \u0125int (t) + \u0125loss (t) \u03a8(r, t) = ih\u0304\u2202t \u03a8(r, t), (1)\nwith the single-particle Hamiltonian\n\u01250 (t) = \u2212\n\n\u0003\nm\u0002 2\nh\u03042\n\u03c9x (t)x2 + \u03c9y2 y 2 + \u03c9z2 (t)z 2 , (2)\n\u2206+\n2m\n2\n\nthe mean-field interaction Hamiltonian\n\u0125int (t) =\n\n4\u03c0a(t)h\u03042\n2\n|\u03a8(r, t)|\nm\nZ\n1 \u2212 3 cos2 \u03b8\u2032\n\u03bc0 \u03bc2\n2\nd3 r\u2032\n+\n|\u03a8(r \u2032 , t)| ,\n3\n\u2032\n4\u03c0\n|r \u2212 r |\n\n(3)\n\nand the loss term\n\u0125loss (t) = \u2212\n\nih\u0304L3\n|\u03a8(r, t)|4 .\n2\n\n(4)\n\nHere, \u03c9x,y,z are the trap frequencies in the respective directions, L3 determines the rate of three-body losses, and\n\u03a8 is the mean-field wave function. The dipoles are polarized along the z-axis, and it is assumed that the trap frequencies in x- and z-directions may be time-dependent,\nalong with the scattering length of the contact interaction, a. We aim to consider the following scenario: Start\nwith the dipolar BEC at parameters for which the condensate is stable in the extended state filling the entire\n3D trap, and ramp down the scattering length and frequencies \u03c9x , \u03c9z simultaneously to values at which a stable anisotropic soliton is expected. In the course of doing this, the trap will be switched off completely in the\nx- and z-directions. Obviously, this condensate-steering\nscenario will excite the condensate. We will exploit this\nfact for proving the self-trapping nature of the DDIs,\nsince stable oscillations without the external trap are\nonly possible if the long-range interactions provide for\nthe self-confinement. To make our model realistic, we\ninclude losses via the imaginary-potential term (4), with\nan empirically known loss coefficient, L3 = 2 \u00d7 10\u221240\nm6 /s [26, 27], and random noise in the scattering length,\nwhich stems from the current in the magnetic coils inducing the Feshbach resonance. The latter is of special\nsignificance, because a typical root-mean-square value of\nthe noise, \u2243 1 \u2212 2 aB , is not much smaller than the range\nof a within which the soliton exists. The noise that we\nused in the simulations is a uniform distribution of all\nfrequencies up to 500 Hz. We do not expect higher frequencies to significantly affect the dynamics of the soliton because the time scale of these dynamics is \u223c 1 s,\nas shown below. We have analyzed the noise signal of\nthe Feshbach-inducing current in the experimental setup\nemployed at the laboratory in Stuttgart [28], observing\nclose agreement with the uniform distribution adopted in\nour scheme.\nThe ramping sequence is shown in Fig. 1. The initial condensate contains 20000 atoms, and is prepared\nin the trap with (\u03c9x , \u03c9y , \u03c9z ) = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 (72, 426, 72) Hz and\na = 27 aB . The scattering length is then ramped down to\n11.5 aB within 70 ms. The trap is first held constant for\nthold = 4 ms and is then ramped to fx,z = f1 = 6.5 Hz\nwithin 58 ms. Finally, it is switched off within subsequent\n33 ms. We emphasize the necessity for eliminating the\ntrap. Even a very weak trapping potential, with f \u223c a\nfew Hz, affects the behavior of the soliton, making it very\ndifficult to distinguish the resulting dynamics from that\nof an ordinary trapped condensate. For the simulations,\nthe 3D spatial domain was discretized into 512\u00d7128\u00d7512\ngrid points, and marching in time is performed using the\nSplit-Operator method. The DDI integral is evaluated\nwith the aid of the Fourier convolution formula. Since\nthis numerical scheme is very demanding, the code was\nimplemented using the parallel computing architecture\nCUDA, and it was run on a modern graphics card, enabling a very high degree of parallelization.\n\n\f3\n\u2206 a = 0.5 aB\n\nfx,z[Hz]\n\na[aB]\n\nno noise\n\n30\n25\n20\n15\nno noise\n10\n\u2206a = 1.0 aB\n5\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n80 0\n70\n60\n50\nthold\n40\n30\n20\n10\nf1\n0\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n\nt = 87 ms\n\n(a)\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\nt = 119 ms\n\n(b)\nt1\n\n0.06\n\nt2\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\nt = 217 ms\n\nt[s]\n\nFIG. 1.

Without the\nnoise, the condensate self-focuses already at t = 303 ms, while\nthis is slowed down when the noise is included. In both cases,\nthe refocusing occurs at the evolution stage when the external\ntrap has already been switched off completely, hence it is the\nDDIs which are responsible for the self-trapping. This is a\nclear indication of the existence of a stable excited soliton.\nIt is important to note that the noise does not destroy the\nsoliton, which is crucial for the experiments.

In the first two frames, the soliton is being\nshaped. It is observed that few atoms escape the core\ncondensate in the x-direction, along which the DDI is\nrepulsive. The condensate then grows further in the xand z-directions, but eventually inverts its dynamics and\nrefocuses. Without the noise, this occurs at t \u2248 303 ms.\nSince this is long after the trap has been switched off, the\nself-confining potential needed for this outcome can only\nbe provided by the DDIs. Thus, we find a clear evidence\nfor the self-trapping of the robust soliton. Remarkably,\nthe condensate refocuses as well when the noise is added\nto the scattering length, as is shown in the right column\nof Fig. 2, i.e., the buildup of the soliton is robust against\nthis experimentally inevitable noise.\nTo gain more insight into the dynamics, we monitored\nthe root-mean-square extensions of the condensate in the\nx- and z-directions during the self-trapping process, as\nshown in Fig. 3. It is observed that the expansion in\nthese directions is roughly synchronous, which implies\nthat a breathing mode has been excited.\nWhen the noise is added to the scattering length, the\ncondensate reaches a greater extension, and the oscillation frequency decreases. Above a critical amplitude of\nthe noise, for which we can give the lower bound of 1 aB ,\nwe expect the soliton to decay. This behavior can be understood in terms of a simple picture: One can replace\nthe noise by an effectively larger scattering length, which\nalso lowers the binding energy of the system and there-\n\n0.8\n\n8\n6\n4\n\nno noise\n\u2206a = 0.5 aB\n\u2206a = 1.0 aB\n\n30\n20\n10\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\nt[s]\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nt[s]\n\nFIG. 3.

Consistent with Ref. [21],\nthe increase of the scattering length, a, also leads to a\nlarger extension of the soliton. Above the critical value\nof a, the soliton decays into a freely expanding condensate. From the experimental point of view, the noise may\neven help to watch the soliton dynamics in situ because\nof the comparably large observable change in the condensate extensions.\nThe small dip in the x-extension at around 100 ms is\nnoteworthy, as it is caused by the still present external\ntrap with a small frequency, f1 , which decelerates the\nexpansion. In line with this trend, increasing f1 from 6.5\nHz to 8 Hz we have observed a more pronounced dip and\na smaller value of the maximum extension, together with\nan increased oscillation frequency. For smaller holding\ntimes thold , meaning that the ramping sequence for the\ntrap begins earlier, we find a shallower dip, leading to\nslower dynamics and larger extensions of the condensate.\nThe simulations show that the time scale governing\nthe dynamics of the soliton is on the order of 1 s, which\nis relatively large for trapped condensates. The main\nlimitation for holding times is imposed by losses caused\nby three-particle collisions, which is modeled in Eq. (1)\nby imaginary potential (4) proportional to the squared\nnumber density. From Fig. 3, we observe that, in the\ncase of the ideal ramp, the soliton is larger in the x- and\nz-directions by a factor of 4\u22125 than the initial condensate\n(in the y-direction, the size is approximately constant).\nThis results in the density reduced by factor \u2243 15 \u2212 25,\nhence the loss rate will rapidly drop when the trap is\nswitched off. Indeed, Fig. 4, where the evolution of the\nnumber of atoms in the condensate during the simulation is plotted, demonstrates that most atoms are lost\nwithin the first 50 ms. Without the noise in the scattering length, the atom number then stays nearly constant\nfor subsequent 300 \u2212 400 ms, and decreases at the end\nof the simulation, when the soliton has reached its smallest extension, i.e., it has returned to the largest density.\nWith the noise present, the mean extensions are even\nlarger, therefore the losses are reduced even more. For\nthe 52 Cr condensate with the scattering length around\n11 aB , we thus conclude that the atom losses will not\ncause decay of the soliton.\nFinally, for parameters of the 164 Dy condensate we find\nthat the threshold scattering length necessary for the existence of the anisotropic solitons is 133 aB . Since the\nactual scattering length of Dy is estimated to be smaller\nthan this value [4], anisotropic solitons may be created in\nthis condensate by means of a simpler procedure, gradually switching off the trap only and keeping the scattering\nlength constant. Applying a simple Gaussian trial wave\nfunction to evaluate the mean-field energy of a condensate which is only trapped in y-direction, as was done\nin Refs. [20, 21], we can estimate the binding energies\nof the soliton in the (x, z) plane for various scattering\nlengths.

(Color online) The number of atoms in the condensate in the course of the formation of the soliton. Most atoms\nare lost during the first 50 ms, when the density is still large\nand the soliton has not yet been formed completely. When\nthe soliton starts its first cycle of oscillations, the loss rate\nrapidly drops, and at the end of the simulation, the condensate still keeps more than 80% of the initial atoms. For the\nnoise amplitude of 1 aB , the losses are not visible at all after\nthe trap has been switched off.\n\noscillation of the excited soliton, showing a crucial dependence on the scattering length. For the confinement\nof 20000 atoms in the y-direction, we choose a trap frequency of 200 Hz, and conclude that the relevant time\nscale varies from 0.5 s to 2 s for the scattering length\nbetween 126 aB and 122 aB . At 128 aB , the time scale\nalready reaches a value \u2243 10 s.\nIn conclusion, we have performed systematic simulations of the realistic model describing the evolution of\nthe dipolar condensate en route to the formation of the\nrecently predicted new species of localized multidimensional solitary modes, in the form of quasi-2D anisotropic\nsolitons. The model includes factors which are crucially\nimportant to the adequate description of the experiment,\nsuch as the three-body losses and Feshbach-induced noise\nin the scattering length. The scenario for the formation of the solitons was elaborated, by gradually switching off the trap and decreasing the scattering length. It\nis demonstrated that, in the chromium and dysprosium\nBEC alike, the solitons may be safely formed, surviving\nthe inevitable excitation of the condensate. Further challenging problems may be the making of soliton clusters,\nand the study of interactions between anisotropic solitons. A more general implication of the reported results\nis the possibility to elaborate similar dynamical scenarios for the creation, under realistic conditions, of various complex multidimensional patterns predicted by the\nanalysis in quantum gases.\nWe thank Stefan M\u00fcller, Emanuel Henn, Juliette Billy,\nTilman Pfau and Luis Santos for valuable discussions.\nThe work of B.A.M. was supported, in part, by the\nGerman-Israel Foundation through grant No. I-10242.7/2009.\n\n\f5\n\n\u2217\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[5]\n[6]\n\n[7]\n[8]\n\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\nkoeberle@itp1.uni-stuttgart.de\nK.
