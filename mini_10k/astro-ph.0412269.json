The two leading explanations of dark energy are a cosmological constant or a slowly\nrolling scalar field e.g.,[3, 4, 5, 6] but an explanation in terms of modifications to the Friedman equations(e.g.[7, 8]\nis also possible. In both cases this component has a negative pressure thus inducing an accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse.\nA significant observational effort is directed to unveil the nature of dark energy (e.g.,[50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55]).\nWith few exceptions [1, 9, 10, 11], current constraints on the nature of dark energy mostly measure the integrated value\nover time of its equation of state parameter (w = \u03c1/p) (e.g.,[1, 2, 12, 13, 14]) or, alternatively its energy density as a\nfunction of time (e.g., [15, 16]), which depends on the integral of the equation of state parameter. These constraints\nare very tight (e.g. [2] finds w = \u22120.98 \u00b1 0.12) and are centered around the expected value for the cosmological\nconstant, but, as pointed out by [17, 18], the finding that the time average value of w is consistent with \u22121 does not\nexclude the possibility that w varied in time. Therefore, it is an open challenge to determine whether dark energy is\na cosmological constant or a rolling of a scalar field.\nA recent review of the current status of our knowledge of the observational determination of w and possible\ntheoretical models to explain it is given by [3].\nFrom a theoretical point of view, it is not only important to clarify whether this energy component is dynamical or\nconstant, but, in case it is not a cosmological constant, it is also of great interest to constrain the potential of the rolling\nscalar field. Since different theoretical models are typically characterised by different potentials, a reconstruction of\nthe dark energy potential from observations can yield more direct constraints on physically motivated dark energy\nmodels.\nIn this paper we present a non-parametric method to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the potential and kinetic\nenergy densities of the dark energy field. Our formalism introduces quantities similar to the Horizon-flow parameters\n[19, 20] in inflation. It has the nice feature that it is easily implemented in the presence of higher order curvature\ncorrections to General Relativity and different types of energy contributions in Einstein's equations, as we do in Section\nII A. Our exact reconstruction formulas determine the value of the potential at a given redshift once the matter density,\nHubble parameter (H) and its first derivative (\u1e22) are experimentally measured at that redshift value. We discuss the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: jsimon@bokchoy.hep.upenn.edu\naddress: lverde@physics.upenn.edu\n\u2021 Electronic address: raulj@physics.upenn.edu\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\nobservational challenges to reconstruct the potential in this fully non-parametric way due to the difficulty in measuring\n\u1e22. As current data is not good enough to determine \u1e22, we present a general parameterization of the potential, based\non an expansion in Chebyshev polynomials. In this approach, the scalar potential function at a given redshift is\nexpanded in Chebyshev polynomials, which constitutes a complete orthonormal basis on a finite interval, and have\nthe nice property to be the minimax approximating polynomial. Our reconstruction equation becomes a differential\nequation for the Hubble parameter, which we solve analytically, and the coefficients in the Chebyshev expansion\nbecome the parameters to be constrained from observations of the Hubble parameter. Our general parameterization\ncan apply to other approaches that were already considered in the literature, such as expansions of the equation of\nstate and we show the correspondence to some parameterizations that have been proposed in the literature. Using\ncurrent data (in particular with recent supernovae data and relative ages of a sample of passively evolving galaxies)\nwe reconstruct the potential of dark energy using our parameterization up to z \u223c 1.8. The reconstructed potentials\nobtained from galaxy ages and SN are consistent. Since these two data sets rely on independent physics and are\naffected by completely different systematics, this finding suggests that possible systematics are not a crucial issue.\nThe reconstructed potential is consistent with being constant up to the maximum redshift of the observations,\nalthough current constraints do not exclude a variation as a function of redshift. We show that data obtained with\nthe Atacama Cosmology Telescope will be able to greatly improve current constraints.\nII.\nA.\n\nMETHOD\n\nDynamics of the scalar field of dark energy\n\nThe classical effective action that we shall use to describe the dynamics of the universe is\n(\n)\nZ\nm2p\ng \u03bc\u03bd\n3 \u221a\n\u03bc\u03bd\nS=\ndt d x \u2212g \u2212\n(R + f (R, R R\u03bc\u03bd , . . . ) +\n\u2202\u03bc q \u2202\u03bd q \u2212 V (q) + Ssources ,\n16\u03c0\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere mp stands for the four dimensional Planck mass and g\u03bc\u03bd for the components of the four dimensional metric,\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 a2 (t) dx2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich we shall consider to be an homogeneous, isotropic and spatially flat FRW cosmology, as supported by recent\ndata [2].\nSsources stands for the classical action describing the physical energy content, such as matter and radiation, but it\ncould also include more exotic sources (e.g. defects, cosmic strings etc.). Note also that we have implicitly assumed\nthe existence of a single canonically normalised quintessence scalar field q(t, ~x) subject to the potential V (q). Thus,\nwe have assumed that this potential is independent of the derivatives of the scalar field. For generality, in Eq. (1)\nwe include the effect of higher derivative terms in the gravitational sector of the theory [7]. These are described by\nthe function f (R, R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd , . . . ) of the different invariants that we can construct out of the metric and its derivatives.\nIn four dimensions, the most general lowest order corrections to Einstein's classical action would be described by\nf = \u03b2 R2 + \u03b4 R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd [56] (see, for example, [21]). Other corrections that have been considered, include arbitrary\nfunctions of the scalar curvature f (R) [22], which include as particular examples linear combinations of negative\npowers of these invariants [23].\nWe focus on cosmologies given by (2), and shall restrict ourselves to classical configurations q = q(t), configurations\nthat do not break the homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime. The energy momentum tensor of this scalar field\nconfiguration is that of a perfect fluid, with density \u03c1q and pressure pq given by\n\u03c1q = K(q) + V (q) ,\n\npq = K(q) \u2212 V (q)\n\nand K \u2261\n\n1 2\nq\u0307 .\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere K denotes the kinetic energy of the field. Under these assumptions, one is led to consider Einstein's equations,\nplus the Klein-Gordon equation of motion for the scalar field. The first ones reduce to Friedmann's equations\n\u03ba\n(\u03c1T + \u03c1q ) ,\n3\n\u03ba\n\u00e4\n= \u2212 (\u03c1T + 3pT + \u03c1q + 3 pq ) ,\na\n6\n\nH2 =\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03ba = 8\u03c0/m2p (or \u03ba = 8\u03c0G). In Eq. (4) we introduced the compact notation \u03c1T and pT for the total energy density\nand pressure. For example \u03c1T denotes the full energy density contribution of Ssources and of the higher derivative\n\n\f3\ncurvature terms f (R, R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd , . . . ). Thus if the sources are a collection of n perfect fluids with constant equation of\nstate \u03c9i i = 1, . . . , n, \u03c1T and pT are\n\u03c1T =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c1i + \u03c1f ,\n\npT =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c9 i \u03c1i + p f ,\n\n(5)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c1f and pf describe the contribution from the higher derivative curvature terms. For the particular function\nf (R2 , R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd ) introduced above, such terms would be written as\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u00e4\n\u00e4\n(3\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4) + 6H 4 (15\u03b2 + 7\u03b4) \u2212 36H 2 (\u03b2 + \u03b4)\na\na\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u00e4\na(3)\na(4)\n2 \u00e4\n(\u03b4 + 3\u03b2) + 2H 4 (15\u03b2 + 7\u03b4) .\n(\u03b4 + 3\u03b2) + 12H\n(\u03b4 + 2\u03b2) + 8H\n(\u03b4 + 9\u03b2) + 2\n= 4\na\na\na\na\n\n\u03ba \u03c1f = \u221212H\n\u03ba pf\n\na(3)\n(3\u03b2 + \u03b4) \u2212 6\na\n\nOn the other hand, the scalar field q(t) equation of motion reduces to\nq\u0308 + 3H q\u0307 + V \u2032 = 0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere V \u2032 = dV /dq.\nB.\n\nReconstruction procedure\n\nIn this section we provide exact analytical expressions in which both, the kinetic and potential energies of the\nquintessence field q(t), depend on quantities more directly observable such as the energy densities, the Hubble constant\nH and its derivatives. Although the higher curvature corrections are not directly observable, they will also have to\nappear in the expressions: they can be taken into account for a given model that is for a given parameterization\nof the functional f . Provided one has an independent way of determining the densities, H and \u1e22, the value of the\npotential V (z) at a given redshift z where these measurements are available, can then be fixed, up to experimental\nuncertainties. If also higher order derivatives of H are known, higher derivatives of the potential can be determined\nd(s) V\n(z), which can be used to probe the flatness of the potential.\ndq(s)\nWe use the analogous of the inflationary horizon-flow parameters [19, 20] {\u03b5n }, which are defined recursively by\n\u03b5n+1 =\n\nd log | \u03b5n |\n,\ndN\n\nn\u22650\n\nwhere N = log(a(t)/a(ti )) is the number of e-foldings since some initial time ti and \u03b50 = H(Ni )/H(N ). There are\nmany similarities between the period of inflation and the present-day accelerated expansion, but, despite the fact that\ninflation happened 13.7 billion years ago, and the accelerated expansion is happening today, as we will see, it is not\nobservationally easier to reconstruct the dark energy potential than it is to reconstruct the inflationary potential. In\nthe equation describing inflationary dynamics the contribution due to matter can be ignored, but it can't be ignored\nwhen describing today's expansion. Moreover, the detailed shape of the primordial power spectum from CMB scales\nto large scale structure scales, and the nature of the primordial perturbations offer a window to test the last 4 inflation\nefoldings; conversely, in the case of dark energy, dark energy started dominating at z < 1, and between then and\nnow the Universe expanded only by a factor < 2. In addition we can measure with exquisite precision perturbations\nfrom inflation but have not detected perturbations from dark energy, which is a very challenging task [24]. On the\nother hand we do not have strong constraints on the energy scale of inflation, that is on the \"normalization\" of\nthe inflationary potential [25, 26] but as we will see, since the matter content of the Universe can be independently\ndetermined, for a flat Universe, we have some constraints on the quintessence potential normalization.\nKeeping in mind the different kind of challenges that a quintessence potential reconstruction faces, we proceed with\nour program. For our purposes, it will be useful to have explicit expressions for the first two parameters\n\u03b51 = \u2212\n\n\u1e22\n\u00e4\ndH (1 + z)\n= 1 \u2212 H \u22122 =\nH2\na\ndz\nH\n\n\u03b52 =\n\n\u03b5\u03071\n,\nH \u03b51\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n\f4\nwhich, we will show, are needed to determine V and V \u2032 [57]. We use the second Friedmann equation (4) to express\nthe first horizon-flow parameter \u03b51 in terms of the energy and pressure densities:\n\u03b51 =\n\n3 \u03c1T + \u03c1q + p T + p q\n.\n2\n\u03c1T + \u03c1q\n\n(9)\n\nIf we write {\u03c1q , pq } in terms of its kinetic and potential energy components, as in (3), we can use (9) to express,\ne.g., the kinetic energy in terms of the potential energy as\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1 2\n3\n1\n\u03b51 (\u03c1T + V ) \u2212 (\u03c1T + pT ) .\nq\u0307 =\n(10)\n2\n3 \u2212 \u03b51\n2\nFinally we can use the first Friedmann equation (4) to solve for the value of the kinetic energy and the potential at\na given redshift z\nK(z) =\n\n1 2\nH2\n1\nq\u0307 = \u03b51\n\u2212 (\u03c1T + pT ) ,\n2\n\u03ba\n2\n\n(11)\n\n1\nH2\n+ (pT \u2212 \u03c1T ) .\n\u03ba\n2\n\n(12)\n\nV (z) = (3 \u2212 \u03b51 )\n\nThis is the generalisation of eq. (16) in [20] which was derived in the context of inflation.\nEquation (12) is a general and exact reconstruction formula for the potential of a quintessence field given the\nassumptions followed in this paper.\nHere, we shall focus in the constraints on the potential at redshifts smaller than 1000. Therefore, we shall neglect\nthe radiation energy density contribution. Furthermore, if we also neglect the contribution from the higher-order\ncurvature terms, the expression for the potential simplifies\nV (z) = (3 \u2212 \u03b51 )\n\n1\nH2\n\u2212 \u03c1m .\n\u03ba\n2\n\n(13)\n\nAnalogously, for the kinetic energy we obtain\nK(z) = \u03b51\n\n1\nH2\n\u2212 \u03c1m .\n\u03ba\n2\n\n(14)\n\nIdeally, our goal would be to constrain the functional form of the potential, V [q], and this is not what (12) provides.\nIf the function q(z) was known this would be straightforward, but q(z) is not an observable quantity. We will show\nlater that V [q] can be obtained if equation (14) can be integrated.\nWe can next determine the first derivative of the quintessence potential. We rewrite (6) as\n\b\n(15)\nV \u2032 = \u2212(q\u0307)\u22121 3H q\u0307 2 + q\u0307 q\u0308 .\nwhere all terms are already known, except for q\u0307 q\u0308 which can be obtained from the time derivative of the kinetic energy\n(11). The end result can be expressed as\n\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u001b\u22121/2 \u001a\n\u0015\u001b\nmp\n\u03ba\n1\n\u03b52\n\u03b51\n\u03ba\n2\n1/2\nV = \u22123 \u221a H (\u03b51 )\n1\u2212\n3H (\u03c1T + pT ) + (\u03c1\u0307T + \u1e57T )\n[\u03c1T + pT ]\n1+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n.\n2 H 2 \u03b51\n6\n3\n6 H 3 \u03b51\n2\n4\u03c0\n(16)\n\u2032\n\nThus, if the values of \u03c1T (z), pT (z) and {H, \u03b51 , \u03b52 } or equivalently, {H, \u1e22, \u1e26}, can be experimentally determined for\nsome redshift z, (16) yields the first derivative of the potential V \u2032 (z). As in the previous discussion, the determination\nof V \u2032 [q(z)] would require the knowledge of q(z).\nThe above formula is the exact result given some energy density content \u03c1T , with associated pressure pT . If we\nrestrict ourselves to a single matter component and neglect the higher order curvature terms, the first potential\nderivative reduces to\n\u001a\n\u001b\u22121/2 \u001a\n\u001b\n\u03ba\n\u03b52\n\u03b51\n\u03ba\nmp\n2\n1/2\n\u2032\n1\u2212\n1+\n(17)\n\u03c1m\n\u03c1m .\n\u2212\n\u2212\nV (z) = \u22123 \u221a H (\u03b51 )\n2 H 2 \u03b51\n6\n3\n4 H 3 \u03b51\n4\u03c0\nand (15) reproduces equation (17) in [20] when the matter density vanishes (\u03c1m = 0).\nIn this case, the first derivative of the potential V \u2032 (z) is known if one can measure \u03c1m (z = 0), {H, \u1e22, \u1e26}.\nAnalogously exact expressions for higher order derivatives of the potential d(r) V [q]/dq r can be obtained by taking\nthe time derivative of (16) and using the exact expression for the kinetic energy (11).\n\n\f5\nC.\n\nRedshift parameterisation of the potential\n\nIn section II B we have shown that an exact reconstrution of V (z) is possible only if H(z) and \u1e22(z) are known.\nWhile the determination H(z) is an observationally challenging task (e.g, [27, 28] and IV), the determination of \u1e22(z)\nis even more formidable. In this section we shall not attempt a non-parametric and exact reconstruction of V (z), we\nshall instead consider a parametric description of the potential (V (\u03b1i , z)) in terms of the redshift z and parameters\n\u03b1i . In section IV we will then use currently available observations to constrain the potential parameters and discuss\nfuture prospects. Hereafter we will set \u03c1f \u2261 0 and defer the more general case of \u03c1f 6= 0 to future work.\nEquation (13), can be rewritten in terms of the independent variable z as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nd H 2 (z)\n1\n2\n3H (z) \u2212 (1 + z)\n= \u03ba V (\u03b1i , z) + \u03c1m (z) \u2261 g(\u03b1i , z) .\n(18)\n2\ndz\n2\nThis is a first order non-linear differential equation which can be integrated analytically:\nZ z\n2\n2\n6\n6\nH (\u03b1i , z) = H0 (1 + z) \u2212 2(1 + z)\ng(\u03b1i , x) (1 + x)\u22127 dx\n0\nZ z\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\nV (\u03b1i , x) (1 + x)\u22127 dx .\n= H02 \u2212 \u03c1m,0 (1 + z)6 + \u03c1m (z) \u2212 2(1 + z)6\n3\n3\n0\n\n(19)\n\nHereafter the 0 subscript denotes the quantity evaluated at z = 0.\nIn this approach if we now consider the kinetic energy of the quintessence field we obtain a first-order non-linear\ndifferential equation for q(z)\nZ z\n1 \u0307 2\n6\n6\n(q) = (1 + z) V0 \u2212 6(1 + z)\nV (\u03b1i , z)(1 + z)\u22127 dz + K0 (1 + z)6 .\n(20)\n2\n0\nor equivalently\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\n\ndq\ndz\n\n\u00132\n\n(1 + z)2 H 2 (\u03b1i , z) = 3\u03ba\u22121 H 2 (\u03b1i , z) \u2212 \u03c1m (z) \u2212 V (\u03b1i , z) ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhich can be integrated to obtain q(z) and thus V [\u03b1i , q] from V (\u03b1i , z):\n\nq(z) \u2212 q(0) = \u00b1\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\n\b \u22121 2\ndz\n6\u03ba H (\u03b1i , z) \u2212 2\u03c1m (z) \u2212 2V (\u03b1i , z)\n(1 + z) H(\u03b1i , z)\n\n1/2\n\n,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the ambiguity in sign comes from the quadratic expression for the kinetic energy. Typically, if we think of an\nscalar field rolling slowly along its potential, the plus sign will be the relevant one.\nFor example let's consider a simple two-parameters parameterization of the potential:\nV = \u03bb (1 + z)\u03b1 ,\n\n(23)\n\nH 2 (z) = H0 (1 + z)6 \u2212 2I\u03b1 (1 + z)6 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhich yields\n\nwhere\n\u03ba\nI\u03b1 = \u2212 \u03c1m (0)\n6\n\u03ba\nI6 = \u2212 \u03c1m (0)\n6\n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u03bb\u03ba \u0002\n(1 + z)\u03b1\u22126 \u2212 1 ,\n(1 + z)\u22123 \u2212 1 +\n\u03b1\u22126\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u22123\n(1 + z) \u2212 1 + \u03bb \u03ba log(1 + z) , \u03b1 = 6\n\u0002\n\n\u03b1 6= 6\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nIf we can neglect the kinetic energy (that is if \u03b1 << 1) then this potential correspond to a constant equation of\nstate w: \u03b1 = 3(w + 1) as in the Ratra-Peebles [3] case and \u03a9q,0 = 6\u03bb/[\u03c1c (6 \u2212 \u03b1)].\n\n\f6\nD.\n\nChebyshev reconstruction\n\nAn interesting parameterization of the potential involves the Chebyshev polynomials, which form a complete set of\northonormal functions on the interval [\u22121, 1]. They also have the interesting property to be the minimax approximating\npolynomial, that is, the approximating polynomial which has the smallest maximum deviation from the true function\nat any given order. We can thus approximate a generic V (z) as\nV (z) \u2243\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03bbn Tn (x)\n\n(27)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere Tn denotes the Chebyshev polynomial of order n and we have normalized the redshift interval so that x =\n2z/zmax \u2212 1; zmax is the maximum redshift at which observations are available and thus x \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. Since |Tn (x)| \u2264 1\nfor all n, for most applications, an estimate of the error introduced by this approximation is given by \u03bbN +1 . With\nthis parameterization, the relevant integral in (20) becomes:\nZ\n\nz\n\n0\n\n\u22127\n\nV (y)(1 + y)\n\nZ 2z/zmax \u22121\nN\nN\nX\nzmax X\n\u22127\n\u03bbn\nTn (x)(a + bx) dx \u2261\n\u03bbn Fn (z)\ndy =\n2 n=0\n\u22121\nn=1\n\n(28)\n\nwhere a = 1 + zmax /2 and b = zmax /2. These integrals can be solved analytically for any order n as shown in the\nappendix: Fn are known analytic functions which are reported in appendix A.\nWe obtain:\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013#\nN\nX\n\u03bbn\n1\n2\n6 2\n(29)\nH (z, \u03bbi ) = (1 + z) H0 1 \u2212 3zmax\nFn (z) \u2212 \u03a9m,0 1 \u2212\n\u03c1\n(1 + z)3\nn=0 c\nwhere \u03c1c denotes the present-day critical density.\nEquation (29) seems to describe the potential with N + 1 parameters (\u03bb0 * * * \u03bbN ). However, since we assume a flat\nUniverse, \u03a9m,0 constrains the coefficients of the Chebyshev polynomials in expansion (27) and the kinetic energy of\nthe field. For example, if the potential is constant (i.e in a cosmological constant case) then it is completely described\nby only one parameter, \u03bb0 , and since q\u0307 = 0, V0 + K0 = V0 = \u03c1q,0 = \u03a9q,0 \u03c1c , we have that \u03bb0 = \u03a9q,0 \u03c1c . However if the\npotential is not constant we obtain\n1 2\nq\u0307 = V0 (1 + z)6 \u2212 V (z) \u2212 6(1 + z)6\n2\n\nZ\n\nz\n\nV (z)(1 + z)\u22127 dz + K0 (1 + z)6\nX\n= V0 (1 + z)6 \u2212 V (z) \u2212 3(1 + z)6 zmax\n\u03bbn Fn + K0 (1 + z)6 .\n\n(30)\n\n0\n\nn\n\nand since V0 =\n\nPN\n\ni=0\n\n\u03bbi (\u22121)n we have the constraint:\nN\nX\n\n\u03bbi (\u22121)n + K0 = \u03a9q,0 \u03c1c .\n\n(31)\n\ni=0\n\nIn section IV we show the constraints that can be obtained for the first few Chebyshev coefficients from currently\navailable data.\nIII.\n\nEQUATION OF STATE\n\nIt is widespread to parameterize dark energy not by the scalar field potential but by its equation of state. In this\nsection we connect the two descriptions.\nA.\n\nTime dependent density scaling\n\nStandard contributions to the energy momentum tensor in Einstein's equations are characterized by a parameter\nthat governs how their energy densities decrease with the expansion of the universe. For the energy density of the\n\n\f7\nscalar field we can write in all generality\n\u03c1q (t) = \u03c1q (0)\n\n\u0012\n\na0\na(t)\n\n\u0013\u03b3(t)\n\n.\n\n(32)\n\nThe Klein-Gordon equation (6) can be expressed as the conservation equation for the energy momentum tensor\ndescribing the scalar field,\n\u03c1 \u0307q + 3H (\u03c1q + pq ) = 0 .\n\n(33)\n\nThus, the pressure of the scalar field pq (t) can be expressed as a function of the time-dependent exponent \u03b3(t)\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nd\u03b3\n\u03b3(t) \u2212 3 1\na0\nH \u22121\n\u03c1q (t) .\n(34)\npq (t) =\n\u2212 log\n3\n3\na(t)\ndt\nUsing ansatz (32), we obtain the kinetic and potential energies for the scalar field\n1\n1 2\nq\u0307 =\n\u03c1q (t) \u2206wq ,\n2\n2 \u0012\n\u0013\n1\nV = \u03c1q 1 \u2212 \u2206wq (t) ,\n2\nwhere we introduced the function (compare to [29])\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\na0\nd\u03b3\n1\n\u03b3(t) \u2212 H \u22121 log\n\u2206wq (t) =\n3\na(t) dt\n\n(35)\n(36)\n\n(37)\n\nwhich depens on the ratio between kinetic and potential energies of the scalar field via\n\u2206wq (t) =\n\n2\n.\n1 + V [q]/K[q]\n\n(38)\n\nThe function \u2206wq (t) controls the deviations from the equation of state of the scalar field wq (t) from being exactly\n\u22121 i.e. a cosmological constant. Indeed, from pq (t) = wq (t) \u03c1q (t), we have\nwq (t) = \u22121 + \u2206wq (t) .\n\n(39)\n\nThus constraining \u2206wq (t) is equivalent to constraining the time (or redshift) evolution of the dark energy equation\nof state for which there are different independent observational constraints (e.g., [3, 30], and references therein)\nWe can relate \u03b3(t) to \u2206wq (t) by integrating (37). Without loosing generality, we do this in terms of the redshift\nZ z\n3\ndy\n\u03b3(z) =\n,\n(40)\n\u2206wq (y)\nlog (1 + z) 0\n1+y\nwhere we did not include a possible integration constant, since it is physically irrelevant, i.e. it just redefines the value\nof the energy density of the scalar field today (\u03c1q (0)). This relation provides an expression for the potential energy\ndensity of the scalar field once the equation of state is known, using (36):\n\u0013\n\u0012\nRz\ndy\n1\nV (z) = \u03c1q (0) e3 0 \u2206wq (y) 1+y 1 \u2212 \u2206wq (z) .\n(41)\n2\nThe case of a constant \u2206wq , or equivalently, a constant equation of state wq would correspond to the redshift\nparameterization considered in (23) with\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03bb = \u03c1q (0) 1 \u2212 \u2206wq , and \u03b1 = 3(1 + wq ) .\n2\nThus, for a physical situation resembling a cosmological constant (wq \u223c \u22121), the parameter \u03b1 \u226a 1, as we claimed in\nthe previous section. Some constant scalar field energy density scalings were discussed by [4]. The above formalism\nis a natural generalisation of their models.\n\n\f8\nB.\n\nBeyond a rolling scalar field\n\nUp to now we have assumed that dark energy is given by a scalar field. The techniques developed here however\ncan also be used in a more general context.\nIf the dark energy is not due to a scalar field we can still describe it as a fluid with a given equation of state. As\nlong as the equation of state w is > \u22121 the two descriptions are equivalent. For example for a given set of parameters\n\u03bbi and H0 and \u03a9m,0 , V (\u03bbi , z) is known, the kinetic energy can be computed using eq. 31, thus \u2206w is known (eq. 38)\nand so w(z) (eq. 39).\nHowever if we want to allow w < \u22121 then the scalar field description as presented here fails. However, analogously to\nsection II D, we can expand the redshift dependence of w in Chebyshev polynomials without imposing any restrictions\non the values that w can take. We thus obtain\nw(z) \u2243\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c9i T (x(z))\n\n(42)\n\ni=0\n\nand\n\"\n\nH 2 (\u03c9i , z) \u2243 H02 (1 + z)3 \u03a9m,0 + \u03a9q,0 exp\n\n!#\nN\nX\n3\nzmax\n\u03c9n Gn (z)\n2\nn=0\n\n(43)\n\nwhere Gn is the analogous of Fn of section II D: Fn is a linear combination of integrals Ii , i = {0, n} while Gn is\nthe same linear combination of the integrals Ji , i = {0, n} (see appendix).\nNote that in this parameterization the present-day value of w is given by\nw0 =\n\nN\nX\n\n(\u22121)i \u03c9i\n\n(44)\n\ni=0\n\nGiven the parameterization (42) of w(z) subject to the constraint w > \u22121 one can always obtain:\n#\n# \"\n\"\nN\nN\nX\nX\n1\n3\n\u03c9i Ti (x(z))\n\u03c9i Gi (z)\n1\u2212\nV (z) = \u03c1q,0 (1 + z)3(1+\u03c90 ) exp zmax\n2\n2\ni=0\ni=1\n\n(45)\n\nIn section IV we show how currently available data can be used to constrain the first few Chebyshev coefficients of\nthis expansion.\nIn the remaining of this section we will compare some models presented in the literature with the parameterization\npresented here. Clearly, the case of a constant equation of state corresponds to \u03c9i = 0 for i > 0. The linear\nparameterization in z [31, 32] corresponds to \u03c9i = 0 for i > 1, and in particular w0 = \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c91 and w\u2032 = 2\u03c91 /zmax .\nFinally the linear parameterization in a [33, 34], w = w0 + wa z/(1 + z) for wa \u226a w0 can be closely approximated by\n\u03c9i = 0 for i > 2, with the constraint (44). [35] pointed out that a simple, 2-parameter fit may introduce biases: the\nexpansion (42) allows one to include more parameters by increasing N as the observational data improve.\nIV.\n\nOBSERVATIONAL DETERMINATION OF H(z)\n\nSection II B has illustrated that it is necessary to determine observationally H(z), \u1e22(z), \u1e26(z) in order to reconstruct\nV [q] and its first derivative V \u2032 [q]. Here we present a determination of H(z) based on the method developed by [36]\nand we emphasize the difficulties of computing \u1e22(z), \u1e26(z). We also present the constraints that can be achieved on\nthe evolution of the quintessence potential and the dark energy equation of state from present and future data.\nA.\n\nDifferential ages of passively evolving galaxies\n\nThe Hubble parameter depends on the differential age of the universe as a function of redshift in the form\n\nH(z) = \u2212\n\n1 dz\n.\n1 + z dt\n\n(46)\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 1: Left panel: the absolute age for the 32 passively evolving galaxies in our catalogue (see text for more detals) determined\nfrom fitting stellar population models is plotted as a function of redshift. Note that there is a clear age-redshift relation: the\nlower the redshift the older the galaxies. Right panel: the value of the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift as derived\nfrom the differential ages of galaxies in the left panel. The determination at z \u223c 0.1 indicated by the '+' symbol is the hubble\nconstant determination of H from [27]. The dotted line is the value of H(z) for the LCDM model.\n\nTherefore a determination of dz/dt directly measures H(z). In [27] we demonstrated the feasibility of the method\nby applying it to a z \u223c 0 sample. In particular, we used the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to determine H(0) and showed\nthat its value is in good agreement with other independent methods (see [27] for more details). With the availability\nof new galaxy surveys it becomes possible to determine H(z) at z > 0. Here we use the new publicly released GDDS\nsurvey [37] and archival data [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43] to determine H(z) in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.8. We proceed\nas follows: first we select galaxy samples of passively evolving galaxies with high-quality spectroscopy. Second, we\nuse synthetic stellar population models to constrain the age of the oldest stars in the galaxy (after marginalising over\nthe metallicity and star formation history), in similar fashion as is done in [27]. We compute differential ages and use\nthem as our estimator for dz/dt, which in turn gives H(z).\nThe first sample is composed of field early-type galaxies from [38, 39, 40]. In [27] we derived ages for this sample\nusing the SPEED models [44]. The second sample is from the publicly released Gemini Deep Survey (GDDS)[37].\nGDDS has high-quality spectroscopy of red galaxies, some of which show stellar absorption features, indicating an old\nstellar population. The GDDS collaboration has determined ages (and the star formation history) for these galaxies\n[45]: they conclude that for a sub-sample of 20 red galaxies the most likely star formation history is that of a single\nburst of star formation of duration less than 0.1 Gyr (in most cases the duration of the burst is consistent with 0 Gyr,\ni.e. the galaxies have been evolving passively since their initial burst of star formation). To determine the galaxies\nages they use a set of stellar population models different than SPEED. We have re-analize the GDDS old sample\nusing SPEED models and obtained ages within 0.1 Gyr of the GDDS collaboration estimate. This indicates that\nsystematics are not a serious source of error for these high-redshift galaxies. We complete our data set by adding the\ntwo radio galaxies 53W091 and 53W069 [41, 42, 43]. In total we have 32 galaxies.\nFig. 1 (left panel) shows the estimated absolute ages for galaxies in the above samples and their 1\u03c3 error bars.\nThere is a distinguishable \"red envelope\": galaxies are older at lower redshifts.\nThe next step is to compute differential ages at different redshifts from this sample. To do so we proceed as follows:\nfirst we group together all galaxies that are within \u2206z = 0.03 of each other. This gives an estimate of the age of the\nuniverse at a given redshift with as many galaxies as possible. The interval in redshift is small to avoid incorporating\ngalaxies that have already evolved in age, but large enough for our sparse sample to have more than one galaxy\nin most of the bins. We then compute age differences only for those bins in redshift that are separated more than\n\u2206z = 0.1 but no more than \u2206z = 0.15. The first limit is imposed so that the age evolution between the two bins is\nlarger than the error in the age determination. This provides with a robust determination of dz/dt. We note here that\ndifferential ages are less sensitive to systematics errors than absolute ages (see [44] for detailed discussion, specially\ntheir table 2). The value of H(z) is then directly computed by using Eq. 46. This is shown in fig. 1 with 1\u03c3 error\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 2: Regions in the \u03bb1 /\u03c1c vs \u03bb0 /\u03c1c (left panel) and \u03bb2 /\u03c1c vs \u03bb0 /\u03c1c (right panel) excluded at the 1 \u2212 \u03c3 and 2 \u2212 \u03c3 joint\nconfidence level, by the priors and the constraints that the kinetic energy in the quintessence field must be positive and that\nat all redshifts \u03c1m + \u03c1q must be positive.\n\nbars. Also shown (dotted line) is H(z) for the LCDM model.\nB.\n\nConstraints on the potential\n\nFollowing the discussion in sec II D, we present constraints on the shape of the potential achieavable from present\nand future data sets. Figure (3) shows the constraints on the first three Chebyshev coefficient for the potential that can\nbe obtained from our galaxy sample, combined with the determination of the Hubble constant at z = 0.09 obtained\nby [27] from the SDSS luminous red galaxies. We have assumed a flat Universe and marginalized over a gaussian\nprior on \u03a9m,0 (\u03a9m,0 = 0.27 \u00b1 0.07 (e.g.,[46]) and a flat prior on H0 (30 < H0 < 100 Km/s/Mpc). We have used\nonly the large scale structure prior on \u03a9m,0 , as the determination of [46] is insensitive to dark energy. Conversely,\nCMB constraints on the matter density of the Universe are highly sensitive to the assumptions about the nature of\ndark energy (see e.g., [2] in particular figure 12), and thus should not be used in this context. Of course, the addition\nof CMB data can greatly improve the constraints on the nature of dark energy, but this need to be done in a joint\nanalysis and it is left to future work.\nSome regions of the parameter space are unphysical as they would yield a negative kinetic energy or \u03c1m + \u03c1q < 0;\nthe combined effect of these priors in the \u03bb1 /\u03c1c vs \u03bb0 /\u03c1c plane and \u03bb2 /\u03c1c vs \u03bb0 /\u03c1c plane is shown in fig. 2. We\nconsider only the region 0 < \u03bb0 /\u03c1c < 1.1, \u22120.5 < \u03bb1 /\u03c1c < 0.5 and \u22120.5 < \u03bb2 /\u03c1c < 0.5.\nIn fig. 3 we show the one and 2 sigma joint confidence contours in the \u03bb0 /\u03c1c vs \u03bb1 /\u03c1c and \u03bb0 /\u03c1c vs \u03bb2 /\u03c1c planes,\nobtained from our H(z) determination. When adding the HST key project prior on H0 [47] the contours remain\nvirtually unchanged. For comparison in figure 4 we show the constraint obtained by using the recent supernovae data\nof [1].\nFigure 5 shows our best fit reconstructed V (z) from our H(z) determination (left panel) and from the SN data\n(right panel), and the 68% and 95% confidence regions. The present constraints are consistent at the 1-\u03c3 level with\na constant potential (that is the cosmological constant scenario).\nThe two determinations (one based on relative galaxy ages and one SN data) are consistent with each other. The\ntwo methods are completely independent and are based on different underlying physics, different assumptions and\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 3: Constraints in the \u03bb1 /\u03c1c vs \u03bb0 /\u03c1c (left panel) and \u03bb2 /\u03c1c vs \u03bb0 /\u03c1c (righ panel) obtained from H(z) measurement based\non relative galaxy ages. Contour levels are 1\u2212\u03c3 marginalized, 1\u2212\u03c3 joint and 2\u2212\u03c3 joint.

The gray regions represent the 1- and\n2- \u03c3 confidence regions. In the left panel the dotted line shows the constraint imposed by the prior.\n\naffected by systematics of completely different nature. The fact that they agree indicates that possible systematics\nare smaller than the statistical errors.\nWith current data there is a degeneracy between the first two coefficients, but we can place an upper limit to the\nkinetic energy in the quintessence field today: the contribution of the kinetic term to \u03c1q is less than 40% at the 2-\u03c3\nlevel and the best fit value is at 0.\nThe Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT;[48] www.hep.upenn.edu/act) will identify, through their SunyaevZeldovich signature in the cosmic microwave background, all galaxy clusters with masses > 1014 M\u2299 in a patch\nof the sky of angular size 100 square degrees. Thus ACT will yield >\n\u223c 500 galaxy clusters in the redshift range\n0.1 < z < 1.5 . For all these clusters, spectra of the brightest galaxies in the cluster will be obtained by South African\nand Chilean telescopes. This will provide us with an unbiased sample of >\n\u223c 2000 passively evolving galaxies from\nz = 1.5 to the present day. To estimate the performance of ACT galaxies at reconstructing the dark energy potential,\nwe have estimated that we will have 2000 galaxies for which ages have been determined with \u223c 10% accuracy and\ntherefore \u223c 1000 determinations of h with \u223c 15% error. Our[58] forecasts in the reconstruction of the dark energy\npotential are shown in fig. 6. We have marginalized over a flat prior on the Hubble constant 30 < H0 < 90 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 and a gaussian prior on \u03a9m,0 , \u03a9m,0 = 0.27 \u00b1 0.035, as an estimate of the improvement of this determination\nfrom galaxy surveys.\nC.\n\nConstraints on the equation of state\n\nIt is illustrative to work out the consequences of the constraints found on \u03bb0 , \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 . Let's consider the potential\n(23) that gives rise to a constant equation of state. If \u03b1 is small then one can approximate the potential with \u03bb(1 + \u03b1z)\nand thus identify the coefficients in the Chebyshev expansion: \u03bb0 \u2212\u2192 \u03bb and \u03bb1 \u2212\u2192 \u03bb\u03b1, \u03bb2 = 0. We thus obtain\n\u03bb1 /\u03bb0 < 0.3 at the 1-\u03c3 level; since \u03bb1 /\u03bb0 \u2243 \u03b1 = 3(w + 1) we obtain w <\n\u223c \u22120.9 at the 1\u2212\u03c3 level.\nAs illustrated in sec. III B for more general cases we can expand the redshift evolution of the equation of state\nparameter in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. Here we show how constraints on w(z) obtained from our galaxysample with the differential ages method compare with other constraints. For example in figure 7 (left panel) we show\nthe constraints in the plane \u03c90 vs \u03c91 (i.e. we impose N = 1 in 42), where we have used the HST key prior for H0\nand the prior \u03a9m,0 = 0.27 \u00b1 0.04 as in [1]. The contours show the 1\u03c3 marginalized, 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 joint confidence levels.\nTo compare with the SN constraints of [1] recall that their w0 is \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c91 . Thus the degeneracy seen in the figure is a\nconstraint on w0 . Three points in the \u03c90 vs \u03c91 parameter space are indicated by the diamond, star and '+' sign. These\npoints are at the 1\u03c3 joint confidence level, well within the 1\u03c3 marginalized level and at the 1\u03c3 marginalized level,\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 6: Predicted constraints for a experiment with 2000 galaxies for which ages are measured with an accuracy of \u223c 10%.\nThe constraint in the Chebyshev coefficients (left panels; circles show the location of the maximum marginalized lielihood while\n'+' show the location of the maximum of the joint -5D- likelihood) and the reconstructed dark energy potential (right panel)\nare significantly better than current constraints (see text). We have a LCDM model as fiducial. The Atacama Cosmology\nTelescope will identify about 500 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.5, for at least 2000 galaxies there will be\nspectroscopic follow up and therefore galaxy ages can be derived.\n\nFIG. 7: Left panel: Constraints in the \u03c90 vs \u03c91 obtained from our galaxy sample with the differential ages method. The\ncontours show the 1 \u2212 \u03c3 marginalized, 1 \u2212 \u03c3 and 2 \u2212 \u03c3 joint confidence levels. The degeneracy constrains w0 \u2261 \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c91 . Three\npoints in the parameter space are selected. Right panel: difference between the hubble constant in a given model and the\nHubble constant in the LCDM model. The points with error-bars are our data points, the long-dashed line corresponds to the\nLCDM model (*-point in the left panel), the dot-dashed line corresponds to the \"diamond\"-point and the dot-dot- dot-dashed\none to the '+'-point.\n\nrespectively. In particular the '*' point correspond to the LCDM model. In the right panel we show the difference\nbetween the Hubble parameter for a given model and that in the LCDM case. Also our determinations of H(z)\nare shown. The long-dashed line corresponds to the LCDM case (* point), the dot-dashed line corresponds to the\n\"diamond\"-point and the dot-dot-dot-dashed line to the '+'-point. It is clear that more data-points in the redshift\nrange around z = 0.7 would help in breaking the degeneracy.\nV.\n\nSLOW-ROLL DARK ENERGY\n\nThe constraints derived from our observational determination of H(z) combined with our theoretical analysis suggest\nthat observations in the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.8 are consistent, at the 1\u03c3 level, with a cosmological constant\n\n\f14\nequation of state (w = \u22121).\nThis suggests to analyse more closely the conditions under which a quintessence field could resemble such an\nequation of state in that redshift range, because this is the challenge we will be facing in the near future.\nThere are at least two different approaches that one can attempt: either work with a generic potential and determine\nthe properties it has to satisfy to resemble a cosmological constant, or attempt to argue some universality in the\nfunctional form of the potential due to its expected flatness in field space.\nA.\n\nSlow-roll in redshift\n\nGiven a generic potential scalar field in the presence of a non-negligible matter energy density \u03c1m (z), we would\nexpect the conditions the potential has to satisfy to be a natural generalisation of the slow-roll conditions during\ninflation, including the effects of matter. These two conditions are :\ndwq (z)\n\u2248 0 \u2200 z \u2208 [0, z0 ] .\n(47)\ndt\nThe first one ensures that dark energy behaves approximately as a cosmolgical constant at a given redshift z, whereas\nthe second ensures that such property is maintained in time.\nThere are several equivalent ways of studying the consequences of these conditions. In terms of the kinetic scalar\nfield energy K[q] and its potential energy V [q], Eq. (47) implies that V [q] \u226b K[q] and that the ratio, K[q]/V [q] is\nnearly constant in time:\nwq (z) \u2248 \u22121 ,\n\nK[q]\n\u226a1,\nV [q]\nd K[q]/V [q]\ndwq (z)\n\u22480 \u21d2\n\u22480.\ndt\ndt\nIn terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom, q(t), conditions (47) are equivalent to\nwq (z) \u2248 \u22121\n\n\u21d2\n\nwq (z) \u2248 \u22121\n\n\u21d2\n\ndwq (z)\n\u22480\ndt\n\n\u21d2\n\n1 2\nq\u0307 \u226a V [q] ,\n2\nq\u0308\nK[q]\n\u2248\n\u226a1,\nV \u2032 [q]\nV [q]\n\n(48)\n\n(49)\n(50)\n\nwhere the last inequality is derived from the identity\nq\u0307 V [q]\ndwq\n=2\ndt\n\u03c12q\n\n\u001a\n\nK[q] \u2032\nq\u0308 \u2212\nV [q]\nV [q]\n\n\u001b\n\n.\n\n(51)\n\nUnder these circumstances, the first Friedmann equation (4) and the Klein-Gordon equation (6) reduce to\nH2\n\u2248 \u03c1m + V ,\n\u03ba\n3H q\u0307 \u2248 \u2212V \u2032 ,\n\n3\n\n(52)\n\nwhich are the extension of the slow-roll equations used in inflation in the presence of matter. One can now rewrite\nconditions (49) and (50) respectively as\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0013\nmp V \u2032\n\u03a9m\n\u226a 48\u03c0 1 +\n,\n(53)\nV\n\u03a9q\nm2p\n\nV \u2032\u2032\n\u226a 24\u03c0\nV\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3 \u03a9m\n,\n1+\n2 \u03a9q\n\n(54)\n\nwhere we already used the fact that \u03c1m V \u22121 \u223c \u03a9m \u03a9\u22121\nq whenever (49) is satisfied.\nFollowing the discussion in section II C, it is also convenient to rewrite these conditions in terms of redshift derivatives\nof the potential V [q(z)]. The analogue of conditions (53) and (54) are:\n1 dV\n6\n\u226a\n,\nV dz\n1+z\n\u0013\u22121 2\n\u0012\nd V\n5\ndV\n\u226a\n.\ndz\ndz 2\n1+z\n\n(55)\n(56)\n\n\f15\nB.\n\nSlow-roll in the field\n\nPhenomenologically, there are many inequivalent functionals that could be chosen to describe the quintessence field\ndynamics. Each of them, would typically depend on a set of undetermined parameters, which would be determined\nby fitting them to observations, as we did in Section IV. In order for a generic potential to look indistingishable from\na cosmological constant, these parameters need to be highly fine tuned.\nIt is precisely this fine tuning that suggests that, independently of the functional form of the potential, the potential\nwill allow an expansion in terms of the variation of the unobservable scalar field variation \u2206q (t) = q(t) \u2212 q(0),\nmeasuring its variation from its current value today.\nLet's assume that there is a certain period of physical time around today, i.e. t = 0, and consistent with the range\nof redshift covered in this work, where the variations in the scalar potential are small in field space. In other words,\nthe potential is \"flat\". Under these conditions, and independently of its functional form, the potential V [q] can be\napproximated by\nV [q] \u2248 V [q(0)] + V \u2032 [q(0)]\u2206q (t) +\n\n\u0001\n1 \u2032\u2032\n2\nV [q(0)] (\u2206q (t)) + O (\u2206q (t)))3 .\n2\n\n(57)\n\nLet us emphasize that such an expansion is always viable for small enough \u2206q , but the Taylor expansion can have a\nwider validity if the potential is flat enough, that is if the derivatives of the potential are small |V n | << V0 and if the\nkinetic energy is small K << V0 .\nFor this to be a good approximation the following two conditions should be satisfied:\n1 \u2032\u2032\nV (q(t) \u2212 q(0)) \u226a V0\u2032 ,\n2 0\nV0\u2032 (q(t) \u2212 q(0)) < V0 ,\n\n(58)\n(59)\n\nn\n\n(n)\n\nwhere we introduced the notation V0 = d d Vqn[q] [q(0)].\nWe shall also assume that the energy of the scalar field q(t) is dominated by the potential energy\n1 2\nq\u0307 \u226a V [q] .\n2\n\n(60)\n\nso that the scalar field dynamics can resemble a cosmological constant (see (48)) and the rolling due to the kinetic\nenergy is small. In the following, we shall proceed to attempt to integrate the system perturbatively.

We have presented a formalism, similar to the horizon-flow\nparameters in inflation, to relate quantities characterizing the dark energy dynamics, i.e. potential and kinetic energy\ndensities, to direct observables such as the matter density \u03c1m (z), the Hubble parameter H(z) and its derivatives.\nThis is the core of our reconstruction programme, and our results are summarised by (12), (11) and (16), which\nprovide the value of the potential and kinetic energy densities, and the first derivative of the potential, as a function\nof redshift. These expressions are valid even in the presence of higher order curvature corrections to General Relativity\nand exotic matter sources. In principle, integrating the exact reconstruction formula for the kinetic energy, allows\none to determine the function q(z). Using the latter, one can infer the real shape of the potential V [q] from the\ndetermination of V (z).\nWe have then focused on the case of a expanding Universe with only matter and dark energy components and at\nz \u226a 1000. In this case the above expressions simplify to (13), (14) and (17). This exact reconstruction formulas\nare currently difficult to be used due to the experimental challenges in determining the derivatives of the Hubble\nparameter IV. However, given a parameterisation for the potential energy density, the relation (18) becomes a\ndifferential equation for the Hubble parameter which can be integrated analytically. Thus determinations of H(z)\ncan be used to constrain V (z) directly. Since effectively one will always be dealing with observations covering a\nfinite redshift range, by an appropiate linear transformation in the redshift variable, we can always work in the\ninterval [\u22121, 1], where we know the set of Chebyshev polynomials provide a complete orthonormal set of functions,\ni.e. any function in the interval can be expressed as a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials. Moreover, these\napproximating polynomials have the smallest maximum deviation from the true function at any given order, and\nprovide a well-defined estimate of the error introduced in the truncation of the expansion at a finite order. We point\nout, in passing, that such a parameterisation could be used in any other attempts considered in the literature where\nit was the equation of state the observable being parameterised by its redshift dependence.\nUsing observations of passively evolving galaxies we obtain measurements of the Hubble parameter at 9 different\nredshifts. We use these determinations to constrain the first three coefficients in the Chebyshev expansion of the\npotential. For comparison we repeat the analysis using recent supernovae data, which give us an integral of the Hubble\nparameter. We find that the reconstructed potentials from both data sets are consistent, giving some confidence that\nthe results are not heavily plagued by systematic errors. The standard LCDM model is consistent with current data\nat the 1sigma level. We show that future data obtained from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope will greatly improve\nthe constraints.\nSince a cosmological constant is a good fit to the observations we asked the question of how to generically describe\nsmall deviations from this simple scenario. It is clear that even if the nature of dark energy might be related to a\ndynamical field, distinguishing such a scenario from a real cosmological constant will be an extraordinary experimental\nchallenge, as the dark energy potential can be arbitrarily close to a constant.\nWe thus analysed the conditions for the dark energy field to \"slow-roll\" in the presence of matter, thus enabling a\ndynamical dark energy to get arbitrarily close to a cosmological constant (47). By expanding the potential in Taylor\nseries for \u2206q (t) = q(t) \u2212 q(0) we derived the generalisation of the standard slow-roll conditions used in inflation, in\nthe presence of matter, which translate into conditions that the functional V [q] must satisfy to explain the maximum\ndeviation allowed from a cosmological constant.\nEven though in this paper we focused on single canonically normalised scalar field, it should be clear that it is\nstraightforward to apply our formalism to an arbitrary number of them, not necessarily being canonically normalised.\nHowever, the observables quantities are the matter density, the Hubble parameter and its derivatives, which depend\non the full kinetic and potential energy densities of the scalar field sector, and are insensitive to whether these values\n\n\f18\nare given by the superposition of more than one field. This opens up the question of whether one would be able to\ndetermine, experimentally, the existence of more than one rolling scalar field. In other words, to which extent it is\npossible to disentagle the full kinetic/potential energy of a superposition of scalar fields into the kinetic/potential\nenergies of their components?\nWe have illustrated the enormous experimental challenges of reconstructing V [q] from V (z) just for a single scalar\nfield. The task is even harder for more than one field as there are more derivative directions to consider, \u2202V /\u2202qi , and\ndirect experimental observables depend only on the time derivatives of the full potential energy, i.e.dV /dt = \u2202V /\u2202qi q\u0307i .\nSuch a disentanglement seems extremely challenging, if not impossible, at least from the perspective of the formalism\ndeveloped here. In this context we can say that our formalism enables one to reconstruct the properties (potential\nand kinetic energy), of an \"effective\" field.\nAppendix A\n\nChebyshev polynomials can be computed using the recursion relation:\nTn+1 (x) = 2xTn (x) \u2212 Tn\u22121 (x) for n \u2265 1\n\n(73)\n\nwhere\nT0 (x) = 1 ,\n\nT1 (x) = x\n\n(74)\n\nThus Tn (x) will have the following structure: Tn (x) = \u03b10 xn + \u03b12 xn\u22122 + \u03b14 xn\u22124 + ....,, so for example:\nT2 (x) = 2x2 \u2212 1\nT3 (x) = 4x3 \u2212 3x\nT4 (x) = 8x4 \u2212 8x2 + 1\n\n(75)\n\n(76)\n\nThe integral on the RHS of Eq.
