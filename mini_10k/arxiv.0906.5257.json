I NTRODUCTION\nThe study of phenomena in which both quantum\nmechanical and general relativistic effects are important,\nmotivated theoretical efforts to construct a theory capable of describing gravitation at the subatomic level: the\nso-called Quantum Gravity (QG) theories. One of the\nmost fundamental results, common to several competing\napproaches to QG, is the quantization of the space-time\ncontinuum, which appears in the form of a space-time\nuncertainty relation \u2206x\u2206t \u2265 const (e.g., [8]).\nA consequence of this discreteness of space-time is\nthat the vacuum will interact with energetic photons\non the Planck scale, acting analogously to a medium\nthat absorbs and re-emits radiation by excitation of its\ninternal degrees of freedom [11]. Lorentz invariance\nviolation (LIV) arises in this context due to a modified\ndispersion relation for the photon, resulting from a\nnon-trivial, spectral dependent refractive index for the\nvacuum of the form n \u2212 1 \u223c E\u03b3 /EQG 1 , where EQG is\nthe energy-scale for QG, expected to be of the order of\nthe Planck energy \u223c EP \u2243 1019 GeV [8].\nFor photons of energies E << EQG , the perturbed\ndispersion relation can be approximated by a series\nexpansion of the form [5]:\n1 Notice that here, unlike an ordinary medium, the vacuum refractive\nindex increases for smaller wavelengths in QG models.\n\n2\nc2 p2 = E 2 [1 + \u03beE/EQG + O(E 2 /EQG\n)]\n\n(1)\n\nDespite the vanishingly small velocity corrections, of\nthe order of 10\u221215 c for a 1 TeV photon, the observation\nof extragalactic gamma-ray sources such as gammaray bursts (GRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\nis a promising laboratory to test this prediction of QG\ntheories. This is because the variations on the speed\nof light, integrated over the large propagation distances\nof the photons, result in sizeable delays that could be\ndirectly measured by high-accuracy timing experiments\n[5], which including the cosmological effects of propagation on an expanding universe [7]:\nZ z\n\u2206E\n\u2206t = H0\u22121\nh\u22121 dz,\n(2)\nEQG 0\nwhere H0 and h are respectively the Hubble constant\nand its associated dimensionless parameter [13], and z\nis the redshift of the source. In the analysis of broad\nspectral band light-curves, this delay will manifest as a\ntime-lag between the arrival times of the lowest and the\nhighest energy photons of \u2248 10\u03be s Gpc\u22121 TeV\u22121 .\nTraditionally, high-energy experiments have drawn\nfrom this principle and, by splitting the light-curves in\ntwo or more energy bins, have looked for significant\nshifts in the times of bursts or sharp features between\nthem, deriving upper limits to the magnitude and energyscale of the QG effects. In the following section we\nwill briefly review the current status and results of these\nsearches, before proceeding to the presentation of our\nmethod.\nII. C URRENT R ESULTS OF T IME - LAG\nM EASUREMENTS\nIn recent years, several high-energy experiments have\nbegun to perform timing analysis in order to identify\nenergy dependent lags in the light curves of distant\nsources such as GRBs and AGNs. In principle, the\nformer would be the preferred targets for the study\nbecause of their large distances and extremely short\nburst features, reaching down to sub-second and even\nmillisecond timescales ([12] and [6]). The advent of\nFERMI brings great prospects to the search for LIV\nsignatures, due to a significant increase in sensitivity.\nThe most constraining GRB results to date come from\nrecent FERMI observations of GRB080916C, and give\na robust lower limit of 1.3 \u00d7 1018 GeV /c2 to the energy\nscales of QG [10].\n\n\f2\n\nBARRES DE ALMEIDA & DANIEL - TEST FOR QUANTUM GRAVITY\n\nNevertheless, AGN observations with ground-based\ngamma-ray telescopes carry the advantage of observations at much higher energies, increasing the magnitude\nof the QG-induced lags one is seeking to tens of seconds.\nRecent results by HESS [1] and MAGIC [3] provide\nlower limits for the onset of QG effects of 1.44 \u00d7 1018\nGeV and 0.52 \u00d7 1018 GeV respectively, in agreement\nwith the newest GRB results. For specialized reviews of\nthese latest results see [9] and [17].\nIII. U NBINNED T ESTS FOR THE D ETECTION OF\nP HOTON D ISPERSION\nGiven the discrete nature of the high-energy data,\ntests that exploit the full information content of the\nlight-curves by looking at individual photons are a\nnatural choice to exploit the maximum sensitivity of the\nexperiments. The new method we propose for detecting\nspectral time-lags in the light-curves of high-energy\nsources has its fundamental idea drawn from the original\napproaches of [4] or [16]. It consists of using the linear\napproximation to the energy-dependent delay given in\nequation (2) to apply a systematic correction \u03c4 > 0 to\nthe arrival times of each individual recorded photon of\nthe form:\n\u2206t = \u2212\u03c4 E,\n\n(3)\n\nso as to cancel any putative QG effects on photon\npropagation. Since the applied correction is to be the\nexact inverse of the original dispersion, the optimal\ncorrection is a direct estimate of the QG energy scale\nand dispersion magnitude \u03be/EP .\nThe QG signature is asymmetric, always introducing\na dispersion to the original burst profile. Therefore the\ncorrection \u03c4 assumed to most closely cancel the timeof-flight delays is expected also to return a burst profile\nwhich is maximally sharp, according to an appropriately\nchosen measure, so that the problem is then reduced to\nthat of the maximization of a cost function. In [16], the\ntwo proposed cost functions are the Shannon Information (or an alternative information-entropy measure) and\nthe average intra-pulse photon-interval, whereas in [4]\nthe authors sought to maximize the total power of the\nburst around its maximum.\nIn any approach of this sort there are two basic\nassumptions in play, which represent limitations to the\nmethod:\ni.) all energy-dependent dispersion corrected in the\ncancelation algorithm is supposed extrinsic to the\nsource and due to QG, since we cannot account\nfor effects intrinsic to the emission process;\nii.) the maximally sharp burst retrieved by the linear\ncorrection is assumed to be an accurate representation of the original burst profile.\nWhilst (i) is an unavoidable condition in (preferential)\nnon-parametric approaches2, we propose a method that\n2 See [15] for an alternative non-binned approach that try to surpass this limitation by introducing a model-dependent cost function,\nincorporating properties of the source emission process.\n\navoids (ii), substituting it by a somewhat less arbitrary\nassumption. As discussed in [16] the problem with this\nlatter condition is that it cannot handle equally well cases\nwhere we have to deal with overlapping or asymmetric\nbursts, in which the maximum sharpness condition may\nnot lead to the correct dispersion cancelation parameter.\nIV. KOLMOGOROV\n\nDISTANCE\n\nGiven two random variables X and Y in R, the simplest measure of the difference between their probability\ndistributions (pdfs) is the Kolmogorov distance, introduced by Kolmogorov in 1933 as a metric for random\nvariables in probability space (see [14] and [18]). For\nFX (x) = prob(X \u2264 x) and FY (x) =prob(Y \u2264 x),\ncumulative distribution functions (cdfs) of X and Y\nrespectively, the Kolmogorov distance is defined as\nDK \u2261 sup |FX (x) \u2212 FY (x)|,\n\n(4)\n\nx\u2208R\n\nthe maximum vertical distance between the two cdfs.\nGiven a broad spectral range light-curve with sufficient photon statistics, we can meaningfully bin the data\nin low and high energy bands, creating two light-curves\nthat should in principle superpose, provided that the high\nand low energy photons were produced simultaneously\nat the source, without any intrinsic net delay (same as\ncondition 1 from last paragraph). After propagation, if\nQG effects are present, the profiles of any given burst in\nthe light curve will differ in the two energy bands, due\nto the different amount of dispersion of the photons, so\nthat the high energy ones will be more strongly shifted\ntowards later arrival times.\nFollowing [16], we represent the bursts by a normalised probability distribution. We construct a photon\ncell xi = 1/dti at the place of each photon i, where\ndti is the waiting time of each photon and xi is then\nindicative of the photon density at each time. We then\ntransform these densities into normalised probability\nmeasures by defining pn = xn /\u03a3xn for every cell n3 .\nFigure 1 illustrates the method.\nA natural way to quantify the relative dispersion\nsuffered by the low and high energy components of the\nburst is to calculate the Kolmogorov distance (K-dist)\nbetween the two constructed pdfs. By doing so, we are\nusing the less affected (and usually better sampled) low\nenergy burst profile as a reference for the process of\nfinding the best cancelation parameter to the dispersion\nof the high-energy light-curve, which is more sensitive\nto the dispersion.\nBy applying a simultaneous correction as in equation\n(5) to the arrival times of each photon in the low and\nhigh energy bins, we want to find the optimum correction\n\u03c4 \u2217 which minimizes the K-dist between the two bursts:\n3 We actually construct the p s from the log(x ) to reduce the inn\nn\nfluence of extremely high-density cells that might arise from statistical\nfluctuations.\n\n\fPROCEEDINGS OF THE 31st ICRC, \u0141\u00d3D\u0179 2009\n\n3\n\n10\n\n11\n\n25\n\n50\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n100\n\n7.5\n5\n2.5\n\nlag (s/TeV)\n\n0\n\n12\n\n15\n10\n\nminimum distance\n\n5\n\nsignificance\n\n0\n\n9\n\ntime(s)\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n2\n\ntime(s)\n\nFig. 1: Illustration of the method of Kolmogorov distances for a Gaussian profile.

P ERFORMANCE\n\nOF THE\n\nM ETHOD\n\nFollowing [5], we define a sensitivity factor\n\u2206t\n(6)\n\u03b4t\nwhere \u2206t represents the relative delay that two photons\nof different energies acquired on their travel from the\nsource as in equation (2), and \u03b4t the width of the\nburst under study. This parameter measures the power\nof the method in relation to the size of the light-curve\nfeatures, which is the most important factor in detecting\nthe delays, and by definition will always be calculated\nrelatively to the delay suffered by a photon of energy\nequal to the average energy of all events in the burst.\nTypical values for the delays are so small (\u223c 1-10\ns/TeV) that in order to detect their effect we have to\n\u03b7\u2261\n\n4 Notice also that we are not relying on confidence intervals and pvalues from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the distributions,\nbut rather using the K-dist as a metric to differentiate them in\nprobability space.\n\neither rely on the observation of extremely short bursts,\nfor which \u03b7 \u2265 1 [6], or on analysis methods sensitive\nto small deformations of the burst profile. Apart from\nGRBs for which \u03b7 > 0.1\u03be is frequent, for AGNs detected\nin the TeV range, the best case to date is from the large\nflare of PKS 2155-304 in 2006 [2]: its shortest-duration\nburst of \u223c 2 min and average photon energy of \u223c 1 TeV,\nimply a sensitivity factor \u03b7 \u223c 0.05\u03be.\nThe top panel of figure 2 shows the simulated performance of the K-dist method in function of \u03b7 for a source\nwith spectral index -2.5 at a distance of 500 Mpc. The\nsensitivity factor is calculated assuming \u03be = 1. Each\nsimulated burst is a MC realisation of an inhomogeneous\npoisson process with 1000 events distributed according\nto a gaussian rate function. The three adjacent points\nfor each value of \u03b7 represent respectively 0, 10 or 20%\nerror in the energy resolution of the observations, which\nis introduced in the simulation at the moment of the\ncorrection for the lag. We can see that the method is only\nlittle affected by it, and that the energy error introduces\na small systematic underestimation on the size of the\nlag, but always compatible with the true lag within one\nstandard deviation.\nThe method as it stands is capable of detecting delays\nwithin 3\u03c3 for \u03b7 \u2264 0.3 (\u03be = 1), corresponding to a burst\n\n\fBARRES DE ALMEIDA & DANIEL - TEST FOR QUANTUM GRAVITY\n\n8\n4\n\n\u03b7 = 0.5\n\n2\n\n6\n\n\u03b7=1\n\n\u03b7 = 0.1\n\n0\n\nsignificance\n\n12\n\n4\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n25\n\nVI.

Taking a\nfeature equivalent to the shortest burst in the PKS 2155304 large flare, we can probe the presence of QG effects\nin a scale up to \u223c 3 \u00d7 1018 GeV, a factor of 10 above\nthe Planck energy, and of the order of the most accurate\nupper limits to date on the QG scale.\nFinally, we have tested how the performance of the\nmethod depends on the source spectral index and how\nit varies in the presence of multiple overlayed bursts;\nthe results are presented in figure 3. To test the effect\nof burst superposition, we generated 4 sets of 10000\nMC realisations of a light-curve each, consisting of two\nidentical gaussian bursts separated by 1, 2, 3 and 5 times\nthe individual profile widths, respectively. We can see\nfrom the upper plot of figure 3 that the superposition\naffects the performance of the method as it broadens\nthe effective width of the feature in which the lag must\nbe detected. The situation is progressively worsened\nas the distance between the individual bursts increase,\nfurther spreading the combined profile, until both are\ncompletely separated (around 3 sigma separation), and\nthe curve reaches its assymtoptic limit. At this point,\nin practice, the individual bursts should be treated individually for better results, which should not represent\na problem as long as their separation is comparable or\nlarger than the average photon lag to be tested; otherwise, there could have occurred significant \"leakage\" of\nphotons between the bursts, which might reflect on the\neffectiveness of the cancelation method.\nThe bottom panel of figure 3 shows the sensitivity\n\nP OSSIBLE VARIATIONS\nM ETHOD\n\nAND\n\nTHE\n\n15\n\npercentual error\n\nburst separation (units of burst width)\n\ncurve in function of the photon index of the burst, which\npresents an optimal minimum around an index of 2.5, for a fixed minimum energy threshold. All bursts\ngenerated for testing this effect had the same number\nof photons (1000) and the energy boundaries of the\nlow- and high-energy profiles are chosen so that the\naverage energy difference between the two profiles and\nthe number of photons in each of them are maximised.\nThe global minimum of the curve at -2.5 results from\nthe fact that for very steep or very hard photon indexes\nboth these factors cannot be ideally optimised.\nON\n\nWe have exposed here the general accords of an\nalternative method to test for energy dependent lags\nin HE light-curves. The method draws inspiration from\nthe unbinned dispersion-cancelation algorithms independently derived by [16] and [3], but it evolves from\na maximum sharpness cost-function approach to the\nminimization of an appropriate distance metric between\nlow- and high-energy components of the burst. By doing\nso we aim to avoid problems such burst asymmetry that\ncan weaken the assumption of maximum sharpness. In\nthis regard, the metric minimization approach has the\nrole of a dynamic fit between the two components of\nthe profile. We are currently testing ways for further\nincreasing the sensitivity of the method. The search for\nnew, more appropriate, distance measures are also under\nway and are encouraged to be tested. Applications of this\nmethod to VHE and GRB data is underway.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nU.Barres de Almeida acknowledges a PhD scholarship\nfrom CAPES Foundation, Ministry of Education of\nBrazil.\nR EFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n\nF.
