The study is based on the work by\nMichel et al.

In this\npaper we revisit the work by Michel et al. (1999) following, however, a new approach\nwhich consists in the search for a single, complete, and coherent solution for all the\nselected stars, in order to constrain and test the assumed physics describing these objects. To do so, refined descriptions for the effects of rotation on the determination of the\nglobal stellar parameters and on the adiabatic oscillation frequency computations are\nused. In addition, a crude attempt is made to study the role of rotation on the prediction\nof mode instabilities. The present results are found to be comparable with those reported\nby Michel et al.

Within the temperature range log T eff = 3.87-3.88 agreement between observations and model computations of unstable modes is restricted to values for\nthe mixing-length parameter \u03b1NL \u2243 1.50. This indicates that for these stars a smaller\nvalue for \u03b1NL is required than suggested from a calibrated solar model. We stress the\npoint that the linear stability analysis used in this work still assumes stellar models without\nrotation and that further developments are required for a proper description of the interaction\nbetween rotation and pulsation dynamics.\nKey words: (Stars: variables:) \u03b4 Sct \u2013 Stars: rotation \u2013 Stars: oscillations \u2013 Stars: fundamental\nparameters \u2013 Stars: evolution \u2013 (Galaxy:) open clusters and associations: general\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nWith spectral types from A2 to F0, the \u03b4 Scuti stars are pulsating\nvariables both in the main sequence and in the sub-giant evolution\nphase (hydrogen shell burning). They are considered as good candidates for asteroseismic studies. Such stars show modes excited\nover a wide frequency range, including mixed modes known to be\nsensitive to the structure of the deep interior. These characteristics,\ntogether with the absence of magnetic field or metallicity peculiarities make them suitable for the asteroseismic study of hydrodynamical processes occurring in stellar interiors, such as convective overshooting, mixing of chemical species, and redistribution of angular\nmomentum (Zahn 1992). Recently, Su\u00e1rez, Goupil & Morel (2006)\nreported that the effect of the distribution of angular momentum\non adiabatic oscillation frequencies in \u03b4 Scuti stars is significant\n\n\u22c6\n\nAssociate researcher at institute (2), E-mail:jcsuarez@iaa.es\n\nand that it can be detected by space missions such as CoRoT. Due\nto the complexity of the oscillation spectra in \u03b4 Scuti stars, their\npulsating behaviour is not completely understood (see Cox 2002,\nfor a complete review of unsolved problems in stellar pulsation\nphysics). In particular, great efforts are made nowadays to solve the\nproblem of mode identification. Ground based multisite campaigns\nare regularly organised within coordinated networks, e.g.: STEPHI\n(Michel et al. 2000) or DSN (Breger 2000; Handler 2000). Only a\nfew tens of the low-degree modes have been detected from groundbased observations, with a maximum of around 75 modes for the \u03b4\nScuti star FG Vir (Breger et al. 2005). The recently launched space\nmission CoRoT 1 (Baglin et al. 2002) represents a unique opportunity for investigating such stars considering its much lower detection threshold and for obtaining data from quasi-uninterrupted time\nseries over 5 months.\n1\n\nhttp://corot.oamp.fr\n\n\f2\n\nJ.C.

In the present work we follow the method described\nby P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez et al. (1999) (hereafter PH99) which improves such a calculation by means of, among other modelling\naspects, updated models and consider the gravity-darkening\nlaw given by Claret A. (1998), which, unlike the von Zeipel law,\nis also valid for non-fully radiative stars. Moreover, in M99 nonrotating equilibrium models were used whereas here we employ\npseudo-rotating models. Such pseudo-models take first-order\neffects of rotation into account by means of an effective gravity\n(see Sect. 3.2). One of the major improvements with respect to\nM99's work lies in the computation of adiabatic oscillation frequencies. In M99 the effects of rotation on the oscillation frequencies (up to the second order) are included in the manner\nof Perez Hernandez et al. (1995), considering the perturbed frequency \u03bd\u2032n as\n\n\u03bd1\n\n179.7\n\n\u03bd2\n\u03bd3\n\n197.2\n396.2\n\n\u03bd\u2032n = \u03bdn + (An + B)\n\nwhere \u03bdn is the unperturbed frequency, \u03bdrot is the rotation\nfrequency, B is a constant with an asymptotic value of 5/3,\nand An corresponds to a coefficient depending on the eigenfunctions, and thus, on the stellar model. These coefficients\nare obtained by interpolating in the values computed by Saio\n(1981) for an n = 3 polytrope. In the present work, following\nDziembowski & Goode (1992) and Soufi et al. (1998) (see also\nSu\u00e1rez, Goupil & Morel 2006) a complete treatment of second\norder effects (including near degeneracy) is used. Furthermore,\nthis formalism takes the effect of the star deformation due to\nrotation into account.\nWith these improvements a similar methodology than that\nadopted in M99 is used here to study five \u03b4 Scuti stars of the\nPraesepe cluster, four of which have already been included in\nthe sample considered by M99. The fundamental parameters\nof these stars are determined from taking into account the effect of rotation on the photometric observables using the updated method by PH99. These fundamental parameters are\nthen used to build representative asteroseismic models for each\nstar, consisting of pseudo-rotating equilibrium models (instead\nof non-rotating equilibrium models used in M99) and their corresponding adiabatic oscillation spectra (properly corrected for\nthe effect of rotation). These asteroseismic models are then used\nto determine the observed ranges radial orders, which, as it was\ndone in M99, are then confronted with mode instability predictions obtained from a linear stability analysis. We note that, as\nin M99, the instability predictions are carried out using equivalent envelope models which do, however, not take the effect of\nrotation into account. This is so because, up to date, there are no\nreliable theories available which describe the effect of rotation\non mode stability. Nevertheless, a crude estimate of this effect is\naddressed, which assumes that mode stability depends predominantly on the effective temperature of the model (Pamiatnykh\n1975).\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 the main characteristics of the Praesepe cluster and the observational material\nare presented. Equilibrium models and isochrone computations are\ndiscussed in Section 3. Different aspects of the oscillation computations are described in Section 4. In Section 5, the consistency of\nour solutions with the results obtained by M99 is examined. Then,\na detailed discussion of the present results is given. Finally, conclusions and perspectives are summarised in Section 6.\n\n\u03bd1\n\n190.4\n\n\u03bd2\n\n193.6\n\n\u03bd3\n\u03bd4\n\n380.9\n234.3\n\nAdditional uncertainties arise from the effect of rapid rotation,\nboth directly on the hydrostatic balance in the star and through mixing caused by circulation or instabilities induced by rotation. The \u03b4\nScuti stars are commonly fast rotators (100 < Vsini < 200 km s\u22121 ),\nand consequently the symmetry of the multiplets is broken by the\nrotation. In the framework of a perturbation analysis, the second\norder effects induce strong asymmetries in the splitting of multiplets (Saio 1981; Dziembowski & Goode 1992) and frequency\nshifts must not be neglected even for radial modes (Soufi et al.\n1995). In this context, Michel et al. (1999), hereafter M99, proposed a technique to estimate and correct the effect of fast rotation on the determination of fundamental parameters for stars in\nclusters. Applying this technique to a set of \u03b4 Scuti stars belonging\nto the Praesepe cluster, the authors showed that it was possible to\nreach a reasonable agreement between ranges of observed oscillation modes and overstable radial modes predicted by a linear stability analysis. However, agreement was found only for certain values\nof \u03b1NL , the mixing-length parameter that was used in the non-local\ntime-dependent convection treatment of the stability computations.\nThis implies that models for convective heat transport in the outer\nstellar layers may be calibrated against observations.\nIn M99, different series of stellar model solutions were obtained, which assumed a wide range of physical parameters,\ne.g. overshooting, mixing-length parameter, metallicity, stellar\nage, etc. Considering these results as our reference domain of\npossible solutions, the present work revisits the work by M99\nbut adopts an improved approach. The main idea is to search for\none particular solution that explains the whole set of observations,\ninstead of sets of individual solutions for each star. To do so, refined\ntechniques for modelling intermediate mass stars are required, in\nparticular such techniques that take different effects of rotation into\naccount. In concrete terms, in M99 the photometric parameters are corrected for the effect of rotation using the results\nof Maeder & Peytremann (1995) who applied the von Zeipel\ngravity-darkening law to estimate the emergent flux of a ro-\n\n\u03bd2rot\n,\n\u03bdn\n\n(1)\n\n\fMode stability in \u03b4 Scuti stars: linear analysis versus observations in open clusters\nTable 2.

In\naddition, metallicities and distances are commonly estimated better\nfor stars in clusters than for field stars. Secondly, the photometric\nparameters of target stars are corrected for the effect of rotation\nfollowing M99 and PH99. Such corrections also provide improved\nestimates for the stellar parameters required for the modelling.\n\n3.1 Stellar models and isochrones\n\nFigure 1.

Four of these stars: BW Cnc,\nBS Cnc, BU Cnc and BN Cnc (HD 73798, HD 73450, HD 73576,\nand HD 73763 respectively) were observed by several campaigns\nof the STEPHI network (Michel et al. 1995). The fifth star, BV Cnc\n(HD 73746), was observed by Frandsen et al. (2001). The observed\nfrequencies of these stars are listed in Table 1.\nRegarding the cluster parameters, its distance modulus (6.28\u00b1\n0.12 mag) was taken from Robichon et al. (1999) who derived it\nfrom mean cluster parallaxes computed from Hipparcos intermediate data. We assume a metallicity value [M/H] of 0.170 which was\nderived from Geneva photometry of single stars with spectral types\nin the range F4-K3 (Grenon 2000; Robichon et al. 1999). Apparent\nmagnitudes and indices were taken from the Rufener's catalogue\n(Rufener 1988). In Table 2 the specific photometric data for the\nfive selected \u03b4 Scuti stars are listed. The projected velocity values\n(Vsini) were taken from Royer et al. (2002).\n\nTo characterise theoretically the observed stars within the cluster we first construct standard non-rotating models and isochrones\nthat take into account the observed parameters presented in Section 2, and second, we also build models including uniform rotation (pseudo-rotating models) as described in Section 3.2. The\nevolutionary stellar models are computed with the CESAM code\n(Morel 1997). Opacity tables are taken from the OPAL package (Iglesias & Rogers 1996), complemented at low temperatures\n(T 6 104 K) by the tables provided by (Alexander & Ferguson\n1994). The atmosphere is constructed from a grey Eddington T \u2212 \u03c4\nrelation. The Praesepe's metallicity value of Z/X is derived from\nthe [M/H] value given in Section 2, assuming (Z/X)\u2299 = 0.0245\n(Grevesse & Noels 1993), Ypr = 0.235, and Zpr = 0 for the helium and heavy element primordial mass abundances, and the value\n\u2206Y/\u2206Z = 2 for the enrichment ratio. This yields an initial helium\nabundance Y = 0.285 and a heavy element abundance Z = 0.025\nfor the cluster. Convection is treated with a local mixing-length\nmodel (B\u00f6hm-Vitense 1958) and we assume various values for the\nmixing-length parameter \u03b1MLT = l/Hp , where l is the mixing length\nand Hp is the pressure scale height. In particular, values between\n0.5 and 2, including the calibrated solar value of \u03b1MLT = 1.614,\nare considered. For the overshoot parameter dOV = lOV /Hp (lOV being the penetration length of the convective elements) we assume\nvalues between 0.0 and 0.3.\nFor the construction of non-rotating isochrones, various sets of\nevolutionary sequences were computed for masses between 1 M\u2299\nand 5 M\u2299 , evolved from the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) to the\nsub-giant branch. Isochrones were then obtained using the Geneva\nIsochrone Code. Three representative isochrones around the age of\nthe Praesepe cluster are depicted in Fig. 1, after having previously\ntransformed their effective temperatures and luminosities into the\nGeneva photometric system. This transformation is performed using the calibration proposed by Schmidt-Kaler (1982) for Mv , and\nby Kunzli et al. (1997) for (B2 \u2212 V1 ). Potential binarity and the effect of fast rotation, discussed in Section 3.2, are expected to induce systematic shifts of the models towards higher luminosities\nand lower effective temperatures when compared with single nonrotating stars. Therefore, in order to avoid both effects, the fit of\nisochrones has to be made by adjusting the isochrones to the bottom\nenvelope of the cluster in the colour\u2013magnitude diagrams (hereafter\nCM diagrams).\nConsidering the physical parametrisation described above, a\nrange of ages between 650 Myr and 750 Myr is then found to be\nrepresentative of the cluster (Fig. 1). This range is in agreement\nwith values found earlier in the literature for the Praesepe cluster.\nThe age will be adjusted more carefully in Section 3.2.\n\n\f4\n\nJ.C. Su\u00e1rez, E. Michel, G.

Dashed and continuous\nsegments correspond to empty and filled circles, respectively. The three\npairs of segments on bottom are associated with BS Cnc, BW Cnc, and\nBV Cnc.

Thick segments correspond to corrections obtained from\nan increase of Vsini by +10%, and the thin segments correspond to corrections obtained from decreasing Vsini by -10%. The continuous curve\ncorresponds to a 650 Myr isochrone (see Fig. 1).\n\n3.2 Stellar parameters corrected for rotation effects\nThe modelling of the observed \u03b4 Scuti stars requires the knowledge of certain basic stellar parameters including the values for\nmass, effective temperature and luminosity (and/or gravity). Two\nof these quantities can be determined from high resolution spectroscopy or, as in the present case, by means of photometric observations. However, as shown in M99, fast rotation must be taken\ninto account when estimating fundamental parameters from photometric indices. In order to take this into account, the authors also\nproposed a method for correcting the photometric indices for the\neffect of fast rotation. Here we use an improved version of this\nmethod, developed by PH99 who considered three main effects:\nFirstly, the shape distortion caused by rotation is such that a\nstar seen pole-on has a larger projected area and hence looks\nbrighter than if it were seen equator-on. Secondly, the flux (and\nhence the effective temperature) is larger at the poles than at\nthe equator (gravity-darkening effect), and thirdly, rotation decreases the intrinsic luminosity and increases the mean radius\nof the star. As a result of these effects the location of a rotating\nstar in a colour-magnitude diagram (and thereby in an HR diagram) depends not only on the angular velocity of the star but\nalso on its angle of inclination i. The basic idea of the method is\nto obtain, for a given rotating star and for a given Vsini value, a\nsegment covering the different potential positions in the colourmagnitude diagram (i.e. for the corresponding putative stars\nwhich are not rotating). The corrections so obtained for the selected \u03b4 Scuti stars are displayed in Fig. 2, in which the positions\nof the non-rotating co-partners are varied with the angle of inclination i, and with the rotation rate \u03c9, defined as \u03c9 = \u03a9/\u03a9c ,\nwhere \u03a9 is the angular rotational velocity of the star, and \u03a9c\n\nis its break-up rotational velocity.2 . Although the corrections\nare model-dependent, for a given isochrone, this dependence\nis weak and the uncertainty introduced smaller than that coming from the observational error in Vsini. An error on the Vsini\nvalues of \u00b110% is assumed, which yields two segments per star.\nAfter an iterative process (more details in PH99) it is possible,\nin most of the cases, to converge to an intersection between the\nisochrone and the segments. The non-rotating co-partners of our\nobserved stars closest to the intersection between the isochrone and\nthe segments give us an estimate of both i and \u03c9. Additionally,\nthe isochrone models at the intersection provide estimates of the\nrequired remaining stellar parameters.\nAs mentioned in PH99, the photometric correction for rotation\ndepends on the selected isochrone. In the present case, the convection parameters \u03b1MLT and dov were adjusted within the ranges given\nin the previous section; the best solution (given by this correction)\nwas obtained for \u03b1MLT = 1.614 and dov = 0.2, leading to an optimal\nage of 650 Myr for the cluster. This solution was selected under\ntwo main criteria: first, a standard fitting of isochrones, and second, the existence of suitable photometric corrections (see PH99\nand Su\u00e1rez et al. 2002 for more details) for the whole sample of\nstars. Both criteria make the solution converge rapidly to an age of\n650 Myr (\u00b120 \u2212 40 Myr). The age uncertainty of 20\u201340 Myr can\nbe neglected in terms of global characteristics of the non-rotating\nco-partners (see the influence of age on photometric corrections for\nrotation in different open clusters in Su\u00e1rez et al. 2002). For this solution, the following range of masses are found: from M = 2.05 \u2013\n2.11M\u2299 (our high mass stars) to 1.64 \u2013 1.65M\u2299 (our low mass stars),\nwhich is within the range of masses obtained in M99. In particular,\nthe high mass models are found to be representative of BU Cnc\n& BN Cnc; the M = 1.70 \u2013 1.73 M\u2299 models are representative of\nBW Cnc & BS Cnc, and finally, the M = 1.64 \u2013 1.65 M\u2299 models are\nrepresentative of BV Cnc. The characteristics of the different models are summarised in Table 3. We recall that the different ranges\nlisted in Table 3 correspond to solutions in which Vsini was varied by \u00b110% from its observed value. As explained in PH99 and\nSu\u00e1rez et al. (2002), this uncertainty largely dominates the errors\nof the method.\nWe then compute stellar models including uniform rotation\nfor the five considered stars, adopting the corrected values for their\nmasses and ages obtained from the method described above. To\ntake first order effects of rotation into account, the equilibrium\nequations are modified in the CESAM code in the manner described in Kippenhahn & Weigert (1990). In particular, the spherically averaged contribution of the centrifugal acceleration is included by means of an effective gravity geff = g \u2212 Ac (r), where\ng is the local gravity, r is the radius, and Ac (r) = 23 r \u03a92 (r) is the\ncentrifugal acceleration of matter elements. This spherically averaged component of the centrifugal acceleration does not change the\norder of the hydrostatic equilibrium equations. From now on we\nshall refer to such models as 'pseudo-rotating' models. Although\nthe non-spherical components of the centrifugal acceleration are\nnot considered in the equilibrium models, they are included in the\nadiabatic oscillation computations by means of a linear perturbation analysis according to Soufi, Goupil & Dziembowski (1998)\n(see also Su\u00e1rez, Goupil & Morel 2006).\n\n2\n\nThis corresponds to the rotational velocity that the star would have if the\ncentrifugal force is balanced by the gravitational attraction at the equator.\n\n\fMode stability in \u03b4 Scuti stars: linear analysis versus observations in open clusters\n\n5\n\nTable 3. Characteristics of the non-rotating counterparts for the selected \u03b4 Scuti stars of the Praesepe cluster. These characteristics are obtained with the method\nfor correcting the effect of rotation on photometric parameters (Section 3.2). The indicated ranges correspond to solutions, from left to right, for which Vsini\nwas varied by +10% and -10% from its observed value (see more details in Section 3.2). The best results with this method are obtained for an age of 650 Myr\nfor the cluster.

Each diagonal-dashed line represents the width (in radial orders) of the represented ranges.\n\n4 DETERMINATION OF OBSERVED AND\nTHEORETICAL RANGES OF UNSTABLE MODES\nWe compute synthetic adiabatic oscillation spectra corresponding to the pseudo-rotating evolutionary models described in Section 3.2. We restrict our computations to modes with degree l 6 2\nsince modes with l > 3 are generally considered to be invisible in photometry (only visible in spectroscopy) for distant stars\ndue to geometric cancellation. The ranges of observed radial and\nnonradial modes are similar to the predicted ranges of computed\n\noverstable radial modes. This is to be expected, because driving\nand damping in \u03b4 Scuti stars takes place predominantly in the\nHeII ionisation zone, which is rather close to the stellar surface,\nwhere the vertical scale is much less than the horizontal scale\nof the oscillations and when l is low the modal inertia is quite\ninsensitive to degree l. It is therefore plausible to use only radial modes in the computations the results of which are also applicable to modes of low degrees (eg. Dziembowski et al. 2001;\nDaszy\u0144ska-Daszkiewicz et al. 2005). Then, proceeding as in M99,\n\n\f6\n\nJ.C. Su\u00e1rez, E. Michel, G. Houdek, F. P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez, and Y. Lebreton\n\nfor each star, the range of predicted unstable radial modes (according to linear growth rates) is compared with observed mode ranges.\n4.1 Determination of observed ranges of radial modes\nTheoretical adiabatic oscillation spectra are computed with the oscillation code filou (Tran Minh & L\u00e9on 1995; Su\u00e1rez 2002). As\nmentioned in Section 1, we are using an improved version of M99's\ntreatment for second-order effects of rotation on the adiabatic oscillation frequencies. In particular, we use the complete treatment of second-order effects of rotation by Su\u00e1rez et al. (2006),\nwhich is based on the formalisms by Dziembowski & Goode\n(1992) and Soufi et al. (1998). Furthermore, the theoretical adiabatic oscillation frequencies are computed from the pseudorotating equilibrium models (Section 3.2), whereas M99 considered only non-rotating equilibrium models. We recall that\nthese pseudo-rotating equilibrium models, representative of\neach star, are computed from the rotationally corrected stellar\nparameters of Sect. 3.2.\nFor each star the range of radial orders of the observed modes\nis then determined in the manner of M99, i.e. the locations of the\npeaks in the observed power spectrum are compared with the locations of radial modes in the theoretical eigenspectrum of the corresponding pseudo-rotating models.\n\n4.2 Predicted unstable modes\nThe stability computations are carried out in the manner of\nBalmforth (1992). We include the Lagrangian perturbations of the\nturbulent fluxes, i.e. the convective heat flux \u03b4Fc and turbulent\npressure3 \u03b4pt in the stability computations according to the nonlocal, time-dependent mixing-length model by Gough (1977a,b).\nThe equilibrium envelope models are obtained by specifying mass,\nluminosity and effective temperature as provided by the evolutionary computations of Section 3, but they are not corrected for\nrotational effects. The radiation field is treated in the Eddington\napproximation, and the atmosphere is considered to be grey and\nplane-parallel. We adopt the nomenclature of M99, i.e. \u03b1NL = l/Hp\nis the mixing-length parameter of the non-local convection model\nused in the stability computations. The non-local mixing-length\nparameter \u03b1NL is calibrated to the same depth of the outer convection zone as suggested by the evolutionary computations (see\nSection 3) which use the standard mixing-length formulation by\nB\u00f6hm-Vitense (1958) and a local mixing-length parameter \u03b1MLT =\n1.614. The so obtained calibrated value of \u03b1NL = 1.89. To study the\neffect of varying the mixing length on mode stability we computed\na second series of stellar models with \u03b1NL = 1.50. Further details\non the stability computations can be found in Houdek et al. (1999).\n\n5 COMPARISON BETWEEN OBSERVED AND\nPREDICTED RANGES OF UNSTABLE RADIAL\nMODES\nWe proceed as in M99 and compare ranges of observed and predicted radial orders n of unstable modes for two values of \u03b1NL : 1.89\nand 1.50 (see Section 4.2). We recall that this comparison does not\n3\n\npt = \u03c1 w2 is the (r, r)-component of the Reynolds stress, where \u03c1 is the\ndensity of the mean stratification and w is the rms vertical component of the\nturbulent velocity field.\n\nimply that all observed modes are identified as radial modes, but\ntheir frequency ranges are analysed in terms of unstable modes described within a range of radial modes (for details see M99).\nThe errors in the calibration from colour indices to effective\ntemperatures can reach 150 K. It is therefore adequate to accept an\nuncertainty of \u00b11 n in the determination of the range of radial orders. In addition, this error also accounts for (1) the difference of\nranges estimated in the co-rotating and the observer's frame, i.e.,\nthe rotational splitting; for modes up to l = 2, this represents a frequency range shift up to \u03bdrot l \u223c 40 \u03bcHz, with \u03bdrot being the stellar\nrotational frequency (up to \u223c 20 \u03bcHz); and (2), for the possible\nl = 1 and 2 modes with frequencies close to the boundaries of\nthe radial order ranges.\n\n5.1 Consistency with the M99 results\nAs a first step, we examine the consistency of the present results\nwith the results by M99. We do so by comparing the ranges of radial\norders (observed and predicted ranges) obtained here (Fig. 3b) with\nthe ranges reported by M99 (Fig. 3a) for BU Cnc, BN Cnc, BW Cnc\nand BS Cnc . In both panels, the observed ranges of radial orders\nare represented by filled circles; those obtained from the stability\nanalysis using \u03b1NL = 1.89 and 1.50 are illustrated by rhombus and\nsquares, respectively. The coordinates (n1 , n2 ) correspond to ranges\nof radial orders between n1 and n2 .\nWhen performing this comparison, it has to be kept in mind\nthat the present work includes various improvements in the stellar\nmodelling over M99 and consequently represents a more specific\nand more precise solution, whereas the M99 results represent an\nextended and conservative set of solutions in terms of model parameters. In this view, we are interested to check if our new solutions do belong to the set of solutions by M99 (and if so, to what\nextent), or if they differ significantly.\nConsidering the observed ranges, Fig. 3 shows that the new\nsolutions lie within those reported by M99. The only significant\ndifference is observed for BN Cnc and which has to be attributed to\nthe updated (high) Vsini value adopted in the present work.\nAs for the instability predictions, our results for the two considered values of \u03b1NL are in general similar, within \u00b11 n, to the\nresults reported by M99.\n\n5.2 Discussion of the present results\nFocusing on the present results, we come to the comparison between observed and predicted ranges which is illustrated in Fig. 3b.\nGenerally, the observed ranges are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions using \u03b1NL = 1.50, whereas with \u03b1NL = 1.89\nthe predicted ranges are in grave disagreement with the observations for the intermediate mass stars BW Cnc and BS Cnc. In M99\nthis agreement (and disagreement) was observed for the set of four\nstars. However, in M99 the comparison between observations and\ntheory was performed for a representative set of model solutions\nwhich were obtained independently for each individual star. On\none hand, M99 reported that the observed and theoretical results\ncould not be made to agree with \u03b1NL = 1.89. On the other hand,\ntheir comparison was in reasonable agreement for models computed with \u03b1NL = 1.50 which, however, does not necessarily mean\nthat they found one consistent model solution for all four objects\n(stars) all of which having the same age and metallicity. The results\nreported here, particularly the fact that we also do not find agreement between observations and theory for models obtained with\n\n\fMode stability in \u03b4 Scuti stars: linear analysis versus observations in open clusters\n\n7\n\nscribing the effect of rotation on mode stability makes it difficult to\novercome this problem. Nevertheless, assuming that mode stability\ndepends predominantly on the effective temperature of the models\n(Pamiatnykh 1975), it is possible to make a rough estimate of the\neffect of varying the model's effective temperature on the location\nof the range of unstable radial modes. The effective temperature\nvaries if the photospheric parameters are corrected for the effect of\nrotation (see Section 3.2). Keeping the remaining model parameters (mass, luminosity and chemical composition) constant we recalculate for each model the linear growth rates. The so obtained\nranges of unstable radial modes are compared with the observations in Fig. 4.\nIn general, the results are similar to those in Fig. 3b, but the\nranges of unstable modes are shifted. For \u03b1NL = 1.50 the unstable ranges are shifted to lower values in the case of BU Cnc and\nBN Cnc, but remain almost unaltered for the remaining stars. On\nthe other hand, for \u03b1NL = 1.89 the unstable ranges are shifted to\nhigher values of n for the more massive objects, and to lower values for the rest of stars. In particular, the discrimination pattern\nof BW Cnc and BS Cnc in Fig. 3b (obtained from the non-rotating\nequilibrium model parameters) is similar to the pattern of BU Cnc\nand BN Cnc in Fig. 4 (obtained from model parameters for which\nT eff is corrected for rotational effects), which are more massive and\nhotter stars (see Table 3). The effective temperatures of BW Cnc\nand BS Cnc in Fig. 4 are similar to the effective temperature of\nBV Cnc in Fig. 3 and, as expected, the stability results are comparable.\n\n6 CONCLUSION\nFigure 4. Same as Fig. 3, but for models with effective temperatures obtained from photospheric parameters that are corrected for rotational effects\n(more details in text).\n\n\u03b1NL = 1.89, support the conclusions reported by M99, but limited to only one consistent model solution for all considered stars,\nwhich is the main objective of the present work.\nFor the massive objects, BU Cnc and BN Cnc, the predicted\nunstable ranges are compatible with the observed results (\u00b11 n),\nfor both \u03b1NL = 1.50 and \u03b1NL = 1.89. The results for both objects\nare thus not sensitive to the value of \u03b1NL . This is to be expected\nbecause these more massive stars have shallower outer convection\nzones and thus their structures are less sensitive to the assumed\nvalue of the mixing-length parameter. In contrast, unstable ranges\npredicted for BW Cnc & BS Cnc show a strong dependence on this\nparameter. The discrimination between the two \u03b1NL values reported\nin M99 is then partially reproduced. Finally, for the less massive\nobject, BV Cnc, the values for \u03b1NL cannot be distinguished. Nevertheless, the observed ranges agree with the theoretical predictions\nwithin \u00b11 n. Therefore, in general, these results constitute a consistent solution in terms of physics and cluster membership, and the\nobserved and theoretical ranges of radial orders are in reasonable\nagreement for all the stars considered in this work.\nAt this point, we should keep in mind that, as in M99, the\nranges of unstable modes were estimated from non-rotating models\nfor the observed stars. Therefore, we may wonder how accurately\nthe so obtained theoretical ranges of unstable modes represent the\nobservations of the rotating stars. However, the lack of theories de-\n\nIn this work we studied ranges of unstable modes predicted by a\nstability analysis and compared the results with observations for a\nselected sample of \u03b4 Scuti stars in the Praesepe cluster. With improved descriptions for rotational effects in both the evolutionary\nand adiabatic oscillations computations, we searched for a single\nconsistent solution in terms of physics and cluster membership in\norder to match reasonably the observed and theoretically predicted\nranges of overstable low-degree modes for all considered stars.\nConsistent solutions were found for models with an age of\n650 Myr, and which were computed with a mixing-length parameter of \u03b1MLT = 1.614 and with a value for dov that is compatible\nwith the grid of solutions provided by M99. In addition, for stellar models with log T eff = 3.87 \u2013 3.88 a value of \u03b1NL \u2243 1.50 leads\nto a reasonable agreement between theoretical predictions and observations of ranges of unstable modes, indicating that for these\nstars a smaller mixing-length parameter \u03b1NL is required than suggested from a calibrated solar model. The need of a smaller value\nfor \u03b1NL than that from a calibrated solar model was also reported\nby Daszy\u0144ska-Daszkiewicz et al. (2005) for the \u03b4 Scuti star FG Vir.\nExisting stability studies (including the present work) rely on\ncalculations of non-adiabatic quantities without the inclusion of\nrotational effects; considering these effects in future investigations\nwould lead to a substantial improvement of the stability analysis. In\na first approximation we noticed an effect on mode stability through\nthe change in effective temperature if it is corrected for rotational\neffects (see Section 3.2). The results presented here (Section 5.2)\nsuggest, at least for some objects, a significant shift in the predicted ranges of unstable modes. Conclusions going beyond these\nfindings, however, would require the development of a theory that\ndescribes the interaction between rotation and pulsation dynamics.\n\n\f8\n\nJ.C. Su\u00e1rez, E.
