KISELEV AND SERGUEI N. NABOKO\nAbstract. We prove an analogue to the Cayley identity for an\narbitrary self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space. We also provide\ntwo new ways to characterize vectors belonging to the singular\nspectral subspace in terms of the analytic properties of the resolvent of the operator, computed on these vectors.

Introduction\nIf M is a matrix in Cn and dM (\u03bb) := det(M \u2212 \u03bb) is its characteristic\npolynomial, the celebrated Cayley identity says that\ndM (M) \u2261 0.\nIn [25] we have studied the \"almost Hermitian\" spectral subspace of\na nonself-adjoint, non-dissipative operator L. The following criterion\nhas been established: a nonself-adjoint operator possesses almost Hermitian spectrum (i.e., its almost Hermitian spectral subspace coincides\nwith the Hilbert space H) iff a natural generalization of Cayley identity\nhold both for the operator itself and its adjoint.\nThis generalization of Cayley identity is formulated in terms of the\nso-called weak outer annihilation. The following definition of it has\nbeen suggested:\nDefinition 1.1. Let \u03b3(\u03bb) be an outer [21] in the upper half-plane C+\nuniformly bounded scalar analytic function. We call this function a\nweak annihilator of an operator L, if\nw \u2212 lim \u03b3(L + i\u03b5) = 0.\n\u03b5\u21930\n\n(1.1)\n\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

NABOKO\n\nAs a by-product of the aforementioned analysis of nonself-adjoint\noperators and using essentially nonself-adjoint techniques (i.e., the dilation of a dissipative operator, see [2]) we have further been able to\nprove, that a self-adjoint operator A has trivial absolutely continuous\nsubspace if and only if A is weakly annihilated in the sense of the above\ndefinition.\nMoreover, the corresponding outer analytic function admits an explicit choice, i.e., it can be chosen to be equal to the perturbation\ndeterminant DA/A\u2212iV (\u03bb) of the pair A, A \u2212 iV [24], where V is an\nauxiliary non-negative trace class operator.\nThe natural question on the possibility to formulate a \"local\" version\nof this criterion for self-adjoint operators with mixed spectrum, i.e.,\nhow to ascertain in similar terms whether the spectrum of a given selfadjoint operator A is purely singular inside some Borel set of the real\nline, was posed some time ago by Prof. David Pearson. The present\npaper is an attempt to give an (in our view, so far incomplete) answer\nto this question. We prove the result envisaged in two quite different\nflavours: the one that we prefer (but analytic difficulties then only\nallow us to give the proof under rather restrictive assumptions on the\noperators' spectrum, see below) and the one that actually allows to\ngive a rigorous proof in the most general case.\nThe paper is organized as follows.\nSince the functional model of a nonself-adjoint operator is of crucial\nimportance for our approach and the proof of our main result relies\nheavily upon the symmetric form of the Nagy-Foia\u015f functional model\ndue to Pavlov [26, 3] (see also the paper [6] by Naboko), we continue\nwith a brief introduction to the main concepts and results obtained in\nthis area in Section 2.\nSection 3 contains our main result, which may be viewed as a generalization of the Cayley identity to self-adjoint operators with an arbitrary\nspectral structure.\nFinally, in Section 4 we derive two new characterizations of vectors\nbelonging to the singular spectral subspace of a self-adjoint operator in\nterms of the analytic properties of the resolvent of the operator, computed on these vectors. The latter are analogous to those used routinely\nin the scattering theory for the absolutely continuous subspace.\nAt this time, we have elected to postpone the discussion of possible\napplications, since the meaningful examples we have in mind, i.e., the\nexamples in which the singularity of the spectrum in a given set is either\nunknown or cannot be obtained by some simpler classical techniques,\ndo require substantial an non-trivial analysis to be fully considered.\n\n\fON CAYLEY IDENTITY. . .\n\n3\n\n2. The functional model of a dissipative operator\nIn the present section we briefly recall the functional model of a\nnonself-adjoint operator constructed in [2, 3] in the dissipative case and\nthen extended in [4, 5, 6, 7] to the case of a wide class of non-dissipative\noperators. We consider a class of nonself-adjoint operators of the form\n[6] L = A + iV, where A is a self-adjoint operator in H defined on\nthe domain D(A) and the perturbation V admits the factorization\nV = \u03b1J\u03b1/2, where \u03b1 is a non-negative self-adjoint operator in H and\nJ is a unitary operator in an auxiliary Hilbert space E, defined as\nthe closed range of the operator \u03b1: E \u2261 R(\u03b1). This factorization\ncorresponds to the polar decomposition of the operator V . It can also\nbe easily generalized to the \"node\" case [8], where J acts in an auxiliary\nHilbert space H and V = \u03b1\u2217 J\u03b1/2, \u03b1 being an operator acting from H\nto H. In order that the expression A + iV be meaningful, we impose\nthe condition that V be (A)-bounded with relative bound less than\n1, i. e., D(A) \u2282 D(V ) and for some a and b (a < 1) the condition\nkV uk \u2264 akAuk + bkuk, u \u2208 D(A) is satisfied, see [9]. Then the\noperator L is well-defined on the domain D(L) = D(A).\nAlongside with the operator L we are going to consider the maximal\n2\ndissipative operator Lk = A + i \u03b12 and the one adjoint to it, L\u2212k \u2261\n2\nLk\u2217 = A \u2212 i \u03b12 . Since the functional model for the dissipative operator\nLk will be used below, we require that Lk is completely nonself-adjoint,\ni. e., that it has no reducing self-adjoint parts. This requirement is not\nrestrictive in our case due to Proposition 1 in [6].\nWe also note that the functional model in the general case of operators with not necessarily additive imaginary part and with non-empty\nresolvent set has been developed in [7].\nNow we are going to briefly describe a construction of the self-adjoint\ndilation of the completely nonself-adjoint dissipative operator Lk , following [2, 3], see also [6].\nThe characteristic function S(\u03bb) of the operator Lk is a contractive,\nanalytic operator-valued function acting in the Hilbert space E, defined\nfor Im\u03bb > 0 by\nS(\u03bb) = I + i\u03b1(L\u2212k \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 \u03b1.\n\n(2.1)\n\nIn the case of an unbounded \u03b1 the characteristic function is first defined\nby the latter expression on the manifold E\u2229D(\u03b1) and then extended by\ncontinuity to the whole space E. The definition given above makes it\npossible to consider S(\u03bb) for Im\u03bb < 0 with S(\u03bb) = (S \u2217 (\u03bb))\u22121 provided\nthat the inverse exists at the point \u03bb. Finally, S(\u03bb) possesses boundary\n\n\f4\n\nALEXANDER V. KISELEV AND SERGUEI N.

Although we\nconsider (g\u0303, g) as a symbol only, the formal expressions g\u2212 := (g\u0303 + S \u2217 g)\nand g+ := (Sg\u0303 + g) (the motivation for the choice of notation is selfevident from what follows) can be shown to represent some true L2 (E)functions on the real line. In what follows we plan to deal mostly with\nthese functions.\nDefine the following orthogonal subspaces in H :\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\n\u0012\nH+ (E)\n0\n, K \u2261 H \u2296 (D\u2212 \u2295 D+ ),\n, D+ \u2261\nD\u2212 \u2261\n0\nH\u22122 (E)\n2\nwhere H+(\u2212)\n(E) denotes the Hardy class [2] of analytic functions f in\nthe upper (lower) half-plane taking values in the Hilbert space E. These\nsubspaces are \"incoming\" and \"outgoing\" subspaces, respectively, in\nthe sense of [11].\nThe subspace K can be described as K = {(g\u0303, g) \u2208 H : g\u2212 \u2261\ng\u0303 + S \u2217 g \u2208 H\u22122 (E), g+ \u2261 Sg\u0303 + g \u2208 H+2 (E)}.

Characterization of singular spectrum in terms of weak\nannihilation\nIn the present section, we attempt to provide a localized criterion\nof pure singularity of the spectrum of a general self-adjoint operator\ninside a given set of the real line, building upon the technique and\napproach developed in [25]. It is worth mentioning that not only the\nproofs of our results in this direction exploit essentially nonself-adjoint\n(in particular, functional model related) techniques, but even certain\ncrucial objects of the nonself-adjoint spectral theory appear already in\ntheir statements.\nOur next Theorem in our view constitutes the most natural localization of the corresponding \"global\" result of [25]. Unfortunately, we are\nonly able to prove the result in this natural form in the case when both\nends of the interval \u2206 where one wants to ascertain pure singularity\nof the spectrum are located inside a spectral gap. Any attempt to get\nrid of this rather horrible restriction requiring crucial a-priori information on the spectral structure fails due to the lack of control over the\nannihilating function at the endpoints of the interval \u2206. It seems that\nin the general setting one has to resort to a quite different (and less\nnatural) definition of annihilation (see Theorem 3.5 below).\nTheorem 3.1. Let A be a (possibly, unbounded) self-adjoint operator in the Hilbert space H. Let a point \u03bb0 \u2208 R belong together with\nsome neighborhood \u2206 to the resolvent set of A. Then the following two\nstatements are equivalent.\n(i) The spectrum of A to the left of the point \u03bb0 is purely singular;\n(ii) There exists an outer bounded in the upper half-plane non-trivial\n(i.e., non-constant) scalar function \u03b3(\u03bb) with real boundary values almost everywhere on (\u03bb0 , +\u221e) and non-real boundary values almost everywhere on (\u2212\u221e, \u03bb0 ), weakly annihilating the operator A, i.e.,\nw \u2212 lim(\u03b3(A + i\u03b5) \u2212 \u03b3\u2217 (A \u2212 i\u03b5)) = 0,\n\u03b5\u21930\n\nwhere \u03b3\u2217 (\u03bb) := \u03b3\u0304(\u03bb\u0304) is an outer bounded in the lower half-plane\nanalytic function.\nProof. Choose V to be a trace class non-negative self-adjoint operator\nin the Hilbert space H such that\n_\n(A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 V H = H.\n(3.1)\nIm \u03bb6=0\n\nClearly, such choice is always possible.\n\n\f6\n\nALEXANDER V. KISELEV AND SERGUEI N. NABOKO\n\nWe follow the approach developed in [6] for the operators L admitting\nthe representation L\u03ba = A + \u03b1\u03ba\u03b1/2, where \u03b1 \u2265 0 is a non-negative\noperator in the Hilbert space H and \u03ba is a bounded operator in the\nsubspace E, being the closure of the range of \u03b1. Choose\u221a\u03b1 to be a\nHilbert-Schmidt class operator defined by the formula \u03b1 = 2V \u2208 S2 .\nThen the operator L\u03ba is well-defined on the domain D(L\u03ba ) = D(A).\nMoreover, L\u03ba \u2261 A when \u03ba = 0, i.e., L0 \u2261 A. Consider the dissipative\noperator Lk \u2261 A+ iV (this operator coincides with LiI ). Clearly, it is a\nmaximal dissipative operator in H; moreover, it is easy to see that the\ncondition (3.1) guarantees that it is also completely nonself-adjoint.\nConstruct the functional model based on the operator Lk (see Section\n1 above). In the corresponding dilation space H the following formulae\ndescribe the action of the resolvent (A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 on all vectors (g\u0303, g) \u2208 K,\nas above K being the model image of H (see [6]):\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\ng\u0303\n1\n\u22121 g\u0303\n\u0001\u22121\n= PK\n(A \u2212 \u03bb)\n, Im \u03bb < 0\ng\n(k \u2212 \u03bb) g \u2212 21 I + (S \u2217 (\u03bb) \u2212 I) 12\ng\u2212 (\u03bb)\n(3.2)\n\u0001\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u22121\n1\ng+ (\u03bb)\ng\u0303 \u2212 21 I + (S(\u03bb) \u2212 I) 12\n\u22121 g\u0303\n= PK\n(A \u2212 \u03bb)\n, Im \u03bb > 0.\ng\ng\n(k \u2212 \u03bb)\n(3.3)\nHere S(\u03bb) is the characteristic function of completely nonself-adjoint\nmaximal dissipative operator Lk , all the other notation has already\nbeen introduced above.\nWe introduce the following notation for the operator functions, appearing in this representation: \u0398A (\u03bb) := I + (S(\u03bb) \u2212 I) 21 and \u0398\u2032A (\u03bb) :=\nI + (S \u2217 (\u03bb) \u2212 I) 21 . The functions \u0398A and \u0398\u2032A are bounded analytic\noperator functions in half-planes C+ and C\u2212 , respectively.\nRecall that the characteristic function S(\u03bb) is a contraction in the\nupper half plane. It follows that, since \u0398A (\u03bb) = (I + S(\u03bb))/2 and\n\u0398\u2032A (\u03bb) = (I + S \u2217 (\u03bb))/2, they are outer contractions (see [2]) in the\nhalf-planes C+ and C\u2212 , respectively.\nBy definition of S(\u03bb), both operator functions also have well-defined\nouter [19, 2] determinants1 \u03b3A , \u03b3A\u2032 , bounded (in fact, contractive) in\ntheir respective half-planes. It is also clear that \u03b3A\u2032 (\u03bb) = \u03b3A (\u03bb). We remark, that \u03b3A (\u03bb) is a clearly non-zero function since lim\u03c4 \u2192+\u221e \u03b3A (i\u03c4 ) =\n1.\n1It\n\nis easy to see that \u03b3A (\u03bb) in fact coincides with the perturbation determinant\nDA/A\u2212iV (\u03bb) of the pair A, A \u2212 iV [24]\n\n\fON CAYLEY IDENTITY. . .\n\n7\n\nW.l.o.g. assume, that the point \u03bb = 0 together with its neighborhood\n\u2206 belongs to the resolvent set of the operator A. It follows that since\nthe operator Lk is completely nonself-adjoint and dissipative, the same\nneighborhood also belongs to its resolvent set. Thus the function S(\u03bb)\nadmits analytic continuation to C\u2212 through the named neighborhood\nof zero and the determinant \u03b3A (\u03bb) is C \u221e there.\nSince \u03b3(\u03bb) is an outer function, it admits the following representation\nin terms of the logarithm of its boundary values on the real line:\n\u001a Z \u0012\n\u0013\u001b\ni\n1\nt\nic\n\u03b3A (\u03bb) = e exp\n+\nlog |\u03b3(t)|dt\n,\n\u03c0 R \u03bb \u2212 t 1 + t2\nwhere \u03b3(t) := \u03b3(t + i0) are the boundary values of the function \u03b3 from\nabove and c is some real constant. From (3.2) it further follows, that\n\u03b3A (t) is separated from zero on \u2206.\nFix a point \u03b40 such that \u2212\u03b40 \u2208 \u2206 and let\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a Z \u2212\u03b40 \u0012\n1\nt\ni\nic\nlog |\u03b3A (t)|dt\n\u03b31 (\u03bb) = e exp\n+\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e \u03bb \u2212 t 1 + t2\nbe the new outer (by construction), bounded in the upper half-plane\nfunction. Let further \u03c6(t) be the harmonic conjugate (or, in other\nwords, the Hilbert transform) of the function f (t), equal to log |\u03b3A (t)|\non (\u2212\u221e, \u2212\u03b40 ) and to 0 elsewhere. Clearly, the function \u03c6(t) is itself\ninfinitely smooth on any interval [\u2212\u03b41 , +\u221e) provided that \u03b41 < \u03b40 .\nChoose yet another function \u03b32 (\u03bb) as follows:\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a Z +\u221e \u0012\n1\nt\n1\n\u2212ic\n+\n\u03c61 (t)dt ,\n\u03b32 (\u03bb) = e exp\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e \u03bb \u2212 t 1 + t2\nwhere \u03c61 (t) is any C 1 (R) function such that \u03c61 (t) \u2261 \u03c6(t), t \u2265 0. As\nit is easily seen, on the right half-line arg \u03b32 (t + i0) = \u2212 arg \u03b31 (t + i0)\nalmost everywhere. What's more, since \u03c61 (t) is C 1 on the real line, its\nharmonic conjugate is continuous and thus bounded [22]. It follows,\nthat the function \u03b32 (\u03bb) is itself bounded and outer in the upper halfplane, admitting the following representation:\n\u001a Z +\u221e \u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\ni\n1\nt\n\u2212ic\n\u03b32 (\u03bb) = e exp\n+\n(\u2212\u03c6\ne1 (t))dt ,\n\u03c0 \u2212\u221e \u03bb \u2212 t 1 + t2\nwhere \u03c6\ne1 (t) is the harmonic conjugate of the function \u03c61 .\nConsider the function \u03b3(\u03bb) := \u03b31 (\u03bb)\u03b32 (\u03bb). By virtue of its construction, it is a bounded outer function in the upper half-plane with almost\neverywhere real boundary values on the right half-line. What's more,\ntogether with its first factor it cancels out the zeroes of the function\n\n\f8\n\nALEXANDER V. KISELEV AND SERGUEI N.

In fact, this can be safely assumed w.l.o.g.: if\nnot, denote by \u03a9 \u2282 (\u2212\u221e, 0) the set of points where the corresponding\nboundary values are real almost everywhere. Then consider a nonnegative smooth enough function g(k) having its support equal to the\nR g(k)\nclosure of \u03a9 and define \u011d(\u03bb) := k\u2212\u03bb\ndk. Multiplication by this outer\nbounded factor clearly equips the function \u03b3(\u03bb) with the properties\nrequired by the Theorem.\nWe will now prove that \u03b3(\u03bb) weakly annihilates the self-adjoint operator A in the sense of the Theorem.\nFirst, let u belong to the spectral subspace EA (0, +\u221e)H of the operator A, where EA (*) is the operator-valued spectral measure associated\nwith A. Then by the spectral theorem and by Lebesgue dominated\nconvergence theorem it is easy to see that\nZ +\u221e\nlimh(\u03b3(A+i\u03b5)\u2212\u03b3\u2217(A\u2212i\u03b5))u, vi =\n(\u03b3(k+i0)\u2212\u03b3\u0304(k+i0)d\u03bcu,v (k) = 0\n\u03b5\u21930\n\n0\n\nfor all v in H (in a nutshell, we have used the fact that the function \u03b3\u2217\nby its construction is an analytic continuation of the function \u03b3 to the\nlower half-plane).\nIt remains to be seen that if u = EA (\u2212\u221e, 0)H, then\nlimh\u03b3(A + i\u03b5)u, vi = 0\n\u03b5\u21930\n\nand\nlimh\u03b3\u2217 (A \u2212 i\u03b5)u, vi = 0\n\u03b5\u21930\n\nfor all v in H, provided that the spectrum of the operator A is purely\nsingular to the left of the point zero. We will check the first identity\nabove, the second being verified analogously.\nThe bounded (due to v.

Let the vector\nu 6= 0, u \u2208 E(\u2212\u221e, 0)H belong to the absolutely continuous spectral\nsubspace Hac .

Since boundary values of \u03b3 are non-zero almost everywhere on the real line and by\nassumption these boundary values are non-real almost everywhere, this\nimplies that the measure d\u03bcu,v \u2261 0 for all v \u2208 H.\nThis completes the proof.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.2. The last Theorem can of course be easily generalized together with the proof given to the situation when the set, where one\ntests the singularity of the spectrum of the operator A, is an arbitrary\nfinite or infinite interval of the real line or even a finite unit of such\ndisjoint intervals.\nRemark 3.3. Note that the existence of a non-zero analytic bounded\nannihilator of the operator A is clearly sufficient for the pure singularity\nof its spectrum to the left of the point \u03bb0 . Nevertheless, our Theorem\nasserts that this function can be chosen to be outer in C+ as well.\nRemark 3.4. Suppose that the operator A is a self-adjoint operator\nwith simple spectrum.

In this case one faces\nthe necessity to modify somewhat the definition of annihilation. The\nfollowing Theorem addresses this.\nTheorem 3.5.

NABOKO\n\nfact, even an R-function), the imaginary part of it has boundary limits\neverywhere on R [22] and moreover, these boundary limits are equal to\nzero on R \\ \u2206 and are non-zero everywhere on \u2206.\nThen \u03b2\u2217 (\u03bb) is an outer bounded analytic continuation of \u03b2 to the\nlower half-plane C\u2212 through the complement R\\\u2206, whereas the jump of\nthe continued function through \u2206, which is proportional to I\u03b2(k + i0),\nis non-trivial everywhere on \u2206.\nBy the spectral theorem of a self-adjoint operator and then by the\nLebesgue dominated convergence theorem it is now easy to see that\n\u03b2(A + i\u03b5) \u2212 \u03b2\u2217 (A \u2212 i\u03b5) \u2192 \u03b20 (A) strongly as \u03b5 \u2192 0, where \u03b20 (k) :=\n2i\u03c0I\u03b2(k + i0).\nOn the other hand, repeating the argument from the proof of the last\nTheorem (namely, from (3.4) to (3.6), where the integral is extended\nfrom (\u2212\u221e, \u2212\u03b40 ) to the whole real line) one arrives at the conclusion\nthat \u03b3(\u03bb) := \u03b3A (\u03bb), where \u03b3A is the same function as above, is such\nthat the operator family \u03b3(A + i\u03b5) has a weak limit as \u03b5 \u2192 0, given by\n(3.6) with the above-mentioned change of the limits of integration.\nIt follows that w \u2212 lim\u03b5\u21930 \u03b3(A + i\u03b5)(\u03b2(A + i\u03b5) \u2212 \u03b2\u2217 (A \u2212 i\u03b5)) exists\nand it's only left to prove that it is equal to zero. Let first u \u2208 EA (\u2206).\nThen h\u03b3(A + i\u03b5)(\u03b2(A + i\u03b5) \u2212 \u03b2\u2217 (A \u2212 i\u03b5))u, vi \u2192 0 for all v \u2208 H by the\nsame argument as in the proof of the preceding Theorem (see (3.7) and\nbelow).\nIf on the other hand u \u2208 EA (R \\ \u2206)H, then the named limit is zero\nsince \u03b20 (A)|EA(R\\\u2206)H = 0 due to the fact that I\u03b2(k + i0) = 0 for all\nk \u2208 R \\ \u2206.\nThe proof of the inverse implication (ii)\u21d2(i) is nothing but a slight\nmodification of the corresponding implication of Theorem 3.1\nIndeed, let the vector u 6= 0, u \u2208 EA (\u2206)H belong to the absolutely\ncontinuous spectral subspace Hac . Then, again by the spectral theorem\nand by Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem it is easy to see that\nZ\n\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b3(k + i0)(\u03b2(k + i0) \u2212 \u03b2\u0304(k + i0))d\u03bcu,v (k) = 0\n\n(by taking EA (\u03b4)v instead of v) for an arbitrary Borel set \u03b4 \u2282 \u03b4. Since\nboundary values of \u03b3 are non-zero almost everywhere on the real line\nand by assumption the boundary values of the imaginary part of \u03b2\nare non-zero in \u2206, this implies that the absolutely continuous measure\nd\u03bcu,v \u2261 0 for all v \u2208 H.\nThis completes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\fON CAYLEY IDENTITY. . .\n\n13\n\n4. On the analytic properties of the resolvent\nWe take this opportunity to prove yet another result. We begin with\nthe following observation, well-known from the mathematical scattering\ntheory. Consider a self-adjoint operator A. Then there exists a linear\nset H\u0303a.c. dense in the absolutely continuous spectral subspace of A such\nthat\nZ\nk\u03b2 exp(iAt)uk2 dt < \u221e\n\nfor all u \u2208 H\u0303a.c. and any non-negative operator \u03b2 \u2208 S2 (see, e.g., [1]).\nUsing the Fourier transform and Parseval's identity, it's easy to see [6]\nthat the last condition is equivalent to:\n\u03b2(A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 u \u2208 H\u00b12 (Ran \u03b2)\n\nfor all u \u2208 H\u0303a.c. Taking an operator V \u2208 S1 as in the proof of the\nprevious Theorem, i.e., a non-negative trace class operator such that\nthe condition (3.1) is satisfied, we can further obtain [6] the following description of the absolutely continuous spectral subspace of the\noperator A:\n\u221a\nHa.c. = clos{u| V (A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 u \u2208 H\u00b12 (E)},\nwhere as in Section 2 E is the auxiliary Hilbert space, being the closed\nimage of the operator V .\nIn this Section, we derive an analogous characterization for the singular spectral subspace Hs of a self-adjoint operator A. Namely, the\nfollowing Theorem holds.\nTheorem 4.1. Let A be a self-adjoint operator in the Hilbert space H.\nLet V \u2208 S1 be a positive trace class operator in H such that (3.1) holds.\nThen if the vector\n\u221a u belongs to the singular spectral subspace Hs of A,\nthen the vector V (A\u2212\u03bb)\u22121 u belongs to vector Smirnov classes N\u00b12 (E)\n[10], i. e., it can be represented as h\u00b1 (\u03bb)/\u03b4\u00b1 (\u03bb), where h\u00b1 \u2208 H\u00b12 (E)\nand \u03b4\u00b1 (\u03bb) are scalar bounded outer analytic functions in half-planes\nC\u00b1 , respectively. Here the functions \u03b4\u00b1 can be chosen independently of\nvector u.\nProof. We again use the functional model constructed based on the\ndissipative operator A + iV .\nLet now u \u2208 Hs . The following identities hold (see [6]):\n\u221a\n2\u03c0g+ (\u03bb) = \u2212\u0398A (\u03bb)\u03b1(A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 u, Im \u03bb > 0,\n(4.1)\n\u221a\n2\u03c0g\u2212 (\u03bb) = \u2212\u0398\u2032A (\u03bb)\u03b1(A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 u, Im \u03bb < 0\n\n\f14\n\nALEXANDER V. KISELEV AND SERGUEI N. NABOKO\n\nHere the operator-functions \u0398A (\u03bb) and \u0398\u2032A (\u03bb) are defined by the identities \u0398A (\u03bb) = (I + S(\u03bb))/2 and \u0398\u2032A (\u03bb) = (I + S \u2217 (\u03bb))/2 (S being the\ncharacteristic function of the dissipative operator A+iV ), and are outer\nS1 \u2013valued contractions in the half-planes C+ and C\u2212 , respectively.\nWithin the conditions of Theorem 4.1 both operator-functions \u0398A (\u03bb)\nand \u0398\u2032A (\u03bb) also possess outer determinants in their respective halfplanes [2]. Therefore, by the uniqueness theorem for scalar bounded\nanalytic functions [21], they are invertible for almost all real k.\nThen we obtain immediately, that for all \u03bb \u2208 C+\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22121\n2V (A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 u = \u2212 2\u03c0\u0398\u22121\nA (\u03bb)g+ (\u03bb) = \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b4+ (\u03bb)\u03a9(\u03bb)g+ (\u03bb),\n\nwhere \u03a9(\u03bb)\u0398A (\u03bb) = \u0398A (\u03bb)\u03a9(\u03bb) = \u03b4+ (\u03bb)I with a bounded operatorfunction \u03a9(\u03bb), i.e., \u03b4+ is the determinant of the operator function \u0398A .\nIt remains to point out (see Section 2), that the function g+ (\u03bb) belongs\nto H+2 (E) as u \u2208 H. Application of a similar argument to the vector\ng\u2212 completes the proof\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.2. As it is easily seen from the definition of \u0398A (\u03bb) and \u0398\u2032A (\u03bb),\nthe functions \u03b4\u00b1 (\u03bb) in the statement of Theorem 4.1 can be chosen so\nthat \u03b4\u2212 (\u03bb) = \u03b4\u0304+ (\u03bb\u0304).\nIn a similar way we are able to give a \"weak\" version of the previous\nTheorem. Indeed, one can easily ascertain (see, e.g., [1, 6]) on the\nbasis of F. and M. Riesz theorem [21] that the absolutely continuous\nsubspace of a self-adjoint operator A can be alternatively characterized\nas follows:\nHa.c. = clos{u|h(A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 u, vi \u2208 H\u00b12 } for all v \u2208 H.\n\nThe following Theorem gives an analogous representation for the singular spectral subspace.\nTheorem 4.3. Let A be a self-adjoint operator in the Hilbert space H.\nThen if the vector u \u2208 H belongs to the singular spectral subspace Hs ,\nthen the function h(A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 u, vi belongs to Smirnov classes N\u00b11 for all\nv \u2208 H, i. e., it can be represented as h\u00b1 (\u03bb)/\u03b4\u00b1 (\u03bb), where h\u00b1 \u2208 H\u00b11 and\n\u03b4\u00b1 (\u03bb) are bounded scalar outer analytic functions in half-planes C\u00b1 ,\nrespectively. Here the functions \u03b4\u00b1 are independent of v \u2208 H and can\nbe chosen independently of vector u.\nProof. We will again use the model description of the resolvent of the\noperator A (3.2), from where it follows that\n*\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012  \u0303\u0013+ *\n\u0012 1 \u22121\n\u0013 \u0012  \u0303\u0013+\n1\nf\n1\ng\u0303\nf\n\u0398\n(\u03bb)g\n(\u03bb)\n+\n2 A\nh(A\u2212\u03bb)\u22121 u, vi =\n\u2212\n,\n,\n,\nf\nf\nk\u2212\u03bb g\nk\u2212\u03bb\n0\n\n\fON CAYLEY IDENTITY. . .\n\n15\n\nwhere (f \u0303, f ) is the model image of the vector v. Let u \u2208 Hs . The\nfirst term on the right hand side is clearly the Cauchy transformation\nof an L1 -function, whereas the second one can be rewritten by residue\ncalculation in the following way:\n*\n\u0013 \u0012  \u0303\u0013+\n\u0012 1 \u22121\n1\nf\n\u0398\n(\u03bb)g\n(\u03bb)\n1\n+\n2 A\n= \u22122\u03c0ih \u0398\u22121\n,\n(\u03bb)g+ (\u03bb), f\u2212 (\u03bb)iE .\nf\n0\nk\u2212\u03bb\n2 A\n\u221a\nBy Theorem 4.1 the vector u is such that V (A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 u \u2208 N+2 (E),\nand therefore by (4.1) again, \u0398\u22121\n1 (\u03bb)g+ (\u03bb) = h+ (\u03bb)/\u03b4+ (\u03bb) for some\n2\nh+ \u2208 H+ (E) and some outer bounded in the upper half-plane function\n\u03b4+ . It follows that if one puts \u03bd(\u03bb) := 1/(\u03bb + i),\n1\n1\nh h+ (\u03bb), f\u2212 (\u03bb)iE \u2261\n\u03b4+ (\u03bb) 2\n1\n1\n[k1 (\u03bb)\u03b4+ (\u03bb)\u03bd(\u03bb) \u2212 2\u03c0ih h+ (\u03bb), f\u2212 (\u03bb)iE \u03bd(\u03bb)] \u2208 N+1 ,\n\u03b4+ (\u03bb)\u03bd(\u03bb)\n2\n\u0001 f \u0303\u0001\ng\u0303\n1\n, f i and f\u2212 (\u03bb) \u2208 H+2 (E).\nsince k1 (\u03bb) := h k\u2212\u03bb\ng\nAn analogous argument applied in the case of C\u2212 completes the\nproof.\n\u0003\nh(A \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 u, vi = k1 (\u03bb) \u2212 2\u03c0i\n\nRemark 4.4. Note that the functions \u03b4\u00b1 (\u03bb) appearing in the proof of\nthe last Theorem are the same as in the proof of Theorem 4.1, i.e., these\ncan be chosen to be equal to the determinants of the operator-functions\n\u0398A (\u03bb) and \u0398\u2032A (\u03bb), respectively. Thus, the corresponding outer factors\nin Theorems 4.1 and 4.3 admit the simplest (and explicitly computable)\nform in the situation when the spectrum of the operator A is simple,\nsee Remark 3.4.\nAcknowledgements.
