Constantin, Majda and Tabak\nproposed a candidate for a singularity for the Quasi-geostrophic equation.\nTheir numerics showed evidence of a blow-up for a particular initial data,\nwhere the level sets of the temperature contain a hyperbolic saddle. The arms\nof the saddle tend to close in finite time, producing a a sharp front. Numerics\nstudies done later by Ohikitani-Yamada [8] and Constantin-Nie-Schorgofer\n[2], with the same initial data, suggested that instead of a singularity the\nderivatives of the temperature where increasing as double exponential in\ntime.\nThe study of collapse on a curve was first studied in [1] for the Quasigeostrophic equation where they considered a simplified ansatz for classical\nfrontogenesis with trivial topology. At the time of collapse, the scalar \u03b8 is\ndiscontinues across the curve x2 = f (x1 ) with different limiting values for the\ntemperature on each side of the front. They show that under this topology\nthe directional field remains smooth up to the collapse, which contradicts the\nfollowing theorem proven in [1]:\nIf locally the direction field remains smooth as t\napproaches T\u2217 , then no finite singularity is possible\nas t approaches T\u2217 .\nThe simplified ansatz with trivial topology studied in [1] does not describe a\nhyperbolic saddle.\nUnder the definition of a simple hyperbolic saddle, in [3], it was shown\nthat the angle of the saddle can not decrease faster than a double exponential\nin time.\nThe criterion obtained in [5] for a sharp front formation for a general two\ndimensional incompressible flow is :\nA necessary condition to have a sharp front at time T is\nZ T\n|u|L\u221e (s)ds = \u221e\n0\n\nRT\nFor the Quasi-geostrophic equation it is not known if the quantity 0 |u|L\u221e (s)ds\ndiverges or not. And the criterion does not say how fast the arms of a saddle\ncan close.\n2\n\n\fIn this paper we do not assume anything on the velocity field, and we show\nthat under a semi-uniform collapse the distance between two level curves cannot decrease faster than a double exponential in time. The semi-uniform collapse assumption greatly weakens the assumptions made in [1] for an ansatz\nfor classical frontogenesis, and the simple hyperbolic saddle in [3].\nIn the case of 2D incompressible Euler equation we are interested in the\nlarge time behavior of solutions.\nThe two equations we discus in this paper, have in common the property\nthat a scalar function is convected by the flow, which implies that the level\ncurves are transported by the flow. The possible singular scenario is due to\nlevel curves approaching each other very fast which will lead to a fast growth\non the gradient of the scalar function. Below we study the semi-uniform\ncollapse of two level sets on a curve. By semi-uniform collapse we mean that\nthe distance of the two curves in any point are comparable.\nThe equations we study are as follows:\nThe Quasi-geostrophic (QG) Equation\nHere the unknowns are a scalar \u03b8(x, t) and a velocity field u(x, t) =\n(u1 (x, t), u2 (x, t)) \u2208 R2 , defined for t \u2208 [0, T \u2217 ) with T \u2217 \u2264 \u221e, and for x \u2208 \u03a9\nwhere \u03a9 = R2 or R2 /Z 2 . The equations for \u03b8, u are as follows\n(\u2202t + u * \u2207x ) \u03b8 = 0\nu = \u2207\u22a5\nx \u03c8 and \u03c8 = (\u2212\u25b3x )\n\n\u2212 21\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b8,\n\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\nwhere \u2207\u22a5\nx f = (\u2212 \u2202x2 , \u2202x1 ) for scalar functions f. The initial condition is\n\u03b8(x, 0) = \u03b80 (x) for a smooth initial datum \u03b80 .\n\nThe Two-Dimensional Euler Equation\nThe unknown is an incompressible velocity field u(x,t) as above with\nvorticity denoted by \u03c9. The 2D Euler equation may be written in the form\n\nu=\n\n\u2207\u22a5\nx\u03c8\n\n(\u2202t + u * \u2207x ) \u03c9 = 0\nand \u03c8 = (\u2212\u25b3x )\u22121 \u03c9,\n\nwith u(x,0) equal to a given smooth divergence free u0 (x).\n\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\f3\n\nResults\n\nAsssume that q = q(x,t) is a solution to (1) or (2), and that a level curve of\nq can be parameterized by\nx2 = \u03c6\u03c1 (x1 , t) f or x1 \u2208 [a, b]\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03c6\u03c1 \u2208 C 1 ([a, b] \u2229 [0, T \u2217 )), in the sense that\nq(x1 , \u03c6\u03c1(x1 , t), t) = G(\u03c1) f or x1 \u2208 [a, b],\n\n(4)\n\nand for certain \u03c1 to be specified below.\nThe stream function \u03c8 satisfies\n\u2207\u22a5 \u03c8 = u.\n\n(5)\n\n\u2202q\n\u2202q \u2202\u03c6\u03c1\n+\n=0\n\u2202x1 \u2202x2 \u2202x1\n\n(6)\n\n\u2202q\n\u2202q \u2202\u03c6\u03c1\n+\n=0\n\u2202t \u2202x2 \u2202t\n\n(7)\n\nFrom (3) and (4), we have\n\nBy (1), (2), (5), (6) and (7) we obtain\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202q\n< \u2212 \u2202x\n,\n>*<\n\u2202\u03c6\u03c1\n2 \u2202x1\n\u2202t\n= \u2212 \u2202q =\n\u2202q\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n2\n\n\u2202q\n, \u2202q\n\u2202x1 \u2202x2\n\n>\n\n2\n\n\u2202q\n\u2202x1\n\u2202q\n\u2202x2\n\n= <\u2212\n\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03c8\n,\n>*<\n\u2202x2 \u2202x1\n\n= <\u2212\n\n\u2202\u03c6\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03c8\n,\n>*<\u2212\n,1 >\n\u2202x2 \u2202x1\n\u2202x1\n\n,1 >\n\nNext\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03c6\u03c1\n(\u03c8(x1 , \u03c6\u03c1 (x1 , t), t)) =\n+\n\u2202x1\n\u2202x1 \u2202x2 \u2202x1\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c6\u03c1\n= <\u2212\n,\n>*<\u2212\n,1 >\n\u2202x2 \u2202x1\n\u2202x1\n4\n\n\fTherefore\n\u2202\u03c6\u03c1\n\u2202\n=\n(\u03c8(x1 , \u03c6\u03c1 (x1 , t), t))\n\u2202t\n\u2202x1\n\n(8)\n\nWith this formula we can write a explicit equation for the change of time\nof the area between two fixed points a, b and two level curves (\u03c6\u03c11 , \u03c6\u03c12 );\n\u0012Z b\n\u0013\nd\n[\u03c6\u03c12 (x1 , t) \u2212 \u03c6\u03c11 (x1 , t)]dx1\ndt\na\n= \u03c8(b, \u03c6\u03c12 (b, t), t) \u2212 \u03c8(a, \u03c6\u03c12 (a, t), t)\n+\u03c8(a, \u03c6\u03c11 (a, t), t) \u2212 \u03c8(b, \u03c6\u03c11 (b, t), t)\n(9)\nAssume that two level curves \u03c6\u03c11 and \u03c6\u03c12 collapse when t tends to T \u2217\nuniformly in a \u2264 x1 \u2264 b i.e.\nZ b\n1\n[\u03c6\u03c12 (x1 , t) \u2212 \u03c6\u03c11 (x1 , t)]dx1\n\u03c6\u03c12 (x1 , t) \u2212 \u03c6\u03c11 (x1 , t) \u223c\nb\u2212a a\nIn other words; the distance between two level sets are comparable for a \u2264\nx1 \u2264 b.\nLet\n\u03b4(x1 , t) = |\u03c6\u03c12 (x1 , t) \u2212 \u03c6\u03c11 (x1 , t)|\nbe the thickness of the front.\nWe define semi-uniform collapse on a curve if (3) and (4) holds and there\nexists a constant c, independent of t, such that\nmin\u03b4(x1 , t) \u2265 c * max\u03b4(x1 , t)\nfor a \u2264 x1 \u2264 b, and for all t \u2208 [0, T \u2217 ).\nWe call the length b-a of the interval [a,b] the length of the front.\nNow we can state the following theorem\nTheorem 1.
