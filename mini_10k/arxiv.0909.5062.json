The good agreement validates the capabilities of the numerical\nsolver.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe low gravity environment of the Bremen Drop Tower has been used to\nstudy inertia-dominated open channel flows. The videos (low-res., high-res.)\nillustrate two characteristic experiments with subcritical and supercritical\nflow rate in a wedge-shaped channel. For subcritical flow rate the interface\ncan balance the pressure difference between the gas phase and the liquid.\nAt supercritical flow rate the decrease of liquid pressure along the flow path\ndue to convective and viscous momentum transport causes the collapse of\nthe free surface. Details of the experimental setup are described in [1]. The\nopening angle of the wedge-shaped channel is 16 degrees with a channel\nheight of three centimeter. The experiment liquid is HFE-7500 (3M). The\n1\n\n\fflow rates for the subcritical case is 2.9 ml/s, which is close to the critical flow\nrate 3.0 ml/s. The flow rate for the supercritical case is 5.0 ml/s. The results\nare compared to numerical calculations with the CFD code OpenFoam [2].\nThe computational grid consists of approx. 200.000 Hex-elements with userdefined grading and dynamical refinement at the interface (interDyMFoam).\n\nReferences\n[1] D.
