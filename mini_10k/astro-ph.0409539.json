INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the standard fireball scenario of gamma-ray bursts\n(GRB's), the observable effects are due to the dissipation of kinetic energy in a highly relativistic fireball\n(see, e.g., Piran (2000); M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros (2002); Waxman\n(2003) for reviews). Synchrotron emission and inverseCompton emission by accelerated electrons are the\nmain radiative processes.\nElectrons accelerated in\nthe internal shock waves within the expanding fireball produce the prompt \u03b3-ray emission, while electrons accelerated in the external shock wave driven\nby the fireball into the surrounding medium produce the afterglow emission, from the X to the radio\nbands. (Paczy\u0144ski & Rhoads 1993; M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros & Rees\n1997; Vietri 1997a; Sari, Piran & Narayan 1998;\nGruzinov & Waxman 1999).\nWhile being in general agreement with observations\n(Band et al. 1993; Preece et al. 1998; Frontera et al.\n2000; M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2002) both theoretical arguments and\nobservational evidence suggest that the optically thin\nsynchrotron - synchrotron self Compton (SSC) emission\nmodel is not complete in explaining neither the prompt\nnor the afterglow emission. Additional physical processes can significantly modify the SSC spectrum. First,\nover a wide range of model parameters, a large number\nof e\u00b1 pairs are produced in internal collisions, due to\nannihilation of high energy photons. Second, relativistic pairs cool rapidly to mildly-relativistic energy, where\ntheir energy distribution is determined by a balance between emission and absorption of radiation. The emergent spectrum, which is affected by scattering off the pair\npopulation, depends strongly on the pair energy distri1 Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot 76100, Israel\n2 asaf@wicc.weizmann.ac.il\n\nbution, and in particular on the \"effective temperature\"\nwhich characterizes the low-end of the energy distribution. Third, proton and electron acceleration to high\nenergies initiates rapid electro-magnetic cascades. It is\nnecessary to follow the evolution of a high energy, nonlinear cascade in order to accurately derive the spectrum.\nAnd last, the plasma is not in steady state, and the particle distributions are continuously evolving.\nOn the observational side, we note that hard spectra, \u03bdF\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 with \u03b1 > 4/3 at low energies, . 300 keV , were observed at early times in\nsome GRB's (Preece et al. 1998; Frontera et al. 2000;\nGhirlanda, Celotti & Ghisellini 2003). These hard spectra is inconsistent with the optically thin synchrotronSSC model predictions. A similar conclusion was obtained by a comparison of the high energy and low energy spectral indices during the prompt emission phase\nof 150 GRB's (Preece et al. 2002). An additional\nhigh energy (> 1 MeV ) spectral component inconsistent with the synchrotron model prediction was reported\nby Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2003). Finally, a recent analysis by\nBaring & Braby (2004) showed difficulty in explaining\nthe high energy component of GRB's early emission by\nthe SSC model.\nThe above mentioned difficulties, raise the need for a\nmodel that can better describe emission under conditions\ncharacterizing GRB's. However, a numeric calculation of\nGRB spectra that takes into consideration creation and\nannihilation of pairs is complicated. The evolution of\nelectromagnetic cascades initiated by the annihilation of\nhigh energy photons occurs on a very short time scale.\nOn the other extreme, evolution of the low-energy, mildly\nrelativistic pairs, which is governed by synchrotron selfabsorption, direct and inverse Compton emission takes\nmuch longer time. The large difference in characteristic time scales poses a challenge to numeric calculations.\n\n\f2\n\nPeer & Waxman\n\nAnother challenge to numerical modeling is due to the\nfact that at mildly relativistic energies the usual synchrotron emission and IC scattering approximations are\nnot valid, and a precise cyclo-synchrotron emission, direct Compton and inverse Compton scattering calculations are required.\nTwo approaches have been employed so far in treating this problem. The first is the Monte-Carlo approach, where individual particles are followed as they\nundergo interactions inside the plasma. This scheme\ntypically suffers from relatively poor photon statistics at\nhigh energies, and does not lend itself to time-dependent\ncalculations. Work done so far using this approach\n(Pilla & Loeb 1998) was limited to parameter space region where the creation of pairs has only a minor effect\non the resulting spectrum. The second approach involves\nsolving the relevant kinetic equations. Following the time\nevolution of the system using this method is straightforward, and photon statistics at high energies is not an\nissue. However, the above mentioned complications limited the accuracy of the numerical models constructed so\nfar (Panaitescu & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1998) above \u223c 1 GeV .\nNote that this method was extensively used in the\npast in the study of active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nplasma (Zdziarski & Lightman 1985; Fabian et al.\n1986; Lightman & Zdziarski 1987; Coppi 1992). Using\nthe numerical models new results were obtained, such\nas the effective pair temperature and the complex pattern of the spectral indices in the X-ray (2 \u2212 10 keV )\nrange (Lightman & Zdziarski 1987), that were not obtained by previous analytic calculations. Non of these\nmodels, however, considered the evolution of high energy electro-magnetic cascades, expected to be relevant\nfor both GRB's and AGN's. In addition, the treatment\nof photon emission in the presence of magnetic field was\nnot complete, since particles are expected to accumulate\nat low energies (\u03b3 \u223c 1), where the synchrotron emission\napproximation used does not hold, and exact treatment\nof cyclo-synchrotron emission is required.\nPair cascade evolution was first studied by\nBonometto & Rees (1971).\nSmall angle cascade\nshowers in anisotropic radiation field were treated by\nBurns & Lovelace (1982).\nGuilbert, Fabian & Rees\n(1983) and Svensson (1987) have generalized the\ntreatment of cascade evolution, showing that it may\nhave a significant effect on the high energy spectrum.\nIt is therefore necessary to incorporate the cascade\ncalculation in order to accurately derive the high energy\nemission spectrum.\nWe have constructed a numerical model that overcomes the numerical challenges. Applying this model to\nGRB plasmas, we have obtained several new results. For\nexample, we have shown (Pe'er & Waxman 2004b) that\nemission peaks at \u223c 1 MeV for \u03c4\u00b1 \u223c 10 \u2212 102 , where\n\u03c4\u00b1 is the optical depth to scattering by pairs, and that\npeak energy at \u226b MeV cannot be obtained for GRB\nluminosity L \u223c 1052 ergs s\u22121. We showed that for large\ncompactness, l\u2032 > 100, the spectral slope below 1 MeV is\nsteep, \u03b52 nph (\u03b5) \u221d \u01eb\u03b1 with 0.5 < \u03b1 < 1 and shows a sharp\ncutoff at 10 MeV . We also showed (Pe'er & Waxman\n2004c) that observations of the early afterglow emission\nat 1 GeV \u2212 1 TeV is informative about two of the most\npoorly determined parameters of the fireball model: the\nambient matter density, and the fraction of thermal en-\n\nergy carried by the magnetic field, \u01ebB .\nWe present in this paper our numerical model. In \u00a72 we\ndescribe the basic model assumptions. We then present\nthe kinetic equations that are being solved, and detailed\ndescription of the numerical treatment of various physical processes. Our numerical integration approach is described in \u00a73. We present the general approach of treating this complicated problem, and the various integration\ntechniques used. In \u00a74 we give examples of numerical results, relevant to the prompt emission phase of GRB's,\nand compare them to approximate analytic results. We\nsummarize in \u00a75 the main features of our method, and\ndiscuss its usefulness for the ongoing research of GRB's\nand AGN's.\n2. MODEL ASSUMPTIONS AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES\n\nWe consider a uniform plasma, composed of protons, electrons, positrons and photons, and permeated\nby a time independent magnetic field. The particle\nand photon distributions are assumed homogeneous and\nisotropic. Considering the physical phenomenon of, e.g.,\nGRB as a motivation, these assumptions are equivalent\nto the assumption that the calculations are carried out in\nthe comoving frame (see \u00a74 below). We assume the existence of a dissipation process, (e.g., collisionless shock\nwaves) which produces energetic particles at constant\nrates, Q(\u03b3) and S(\u03b3) electrons and protons respectively\nper unit time per unit volume per unit Lorentz factor,\n\u03b3. Since the details of the acceleration process are not\nyet known, we do not specify here the functions Q(\u03b3)\nand S(\u03b3). These functions are specified when treating a\nparticular problem (see \u00a74). Motivated by the GRB fireball model scenario, in which the internal shock waves\ncross the colliding shells at relativistic speeds, we assume that the dissipation process occurs on a characteristic time scale which is equal to the light crossing time,\ntdyn \u223c R/c, where R is a characteristic length scale of\nthe plasma.\nThe population of electrons, positrons and photons is\naffected by synchrotron emission, synchrotron self absorption, Compton scattering, pair production and pair\nannihilation, that occur simultaneously during the dynamical time, tdyn . In this version of the code, protons\nare assumed to interact via photo-meson interactions\nonly, producing pions that decay into energetic photons\nand positrons. Coulomb scattering is not considered, because, as we show in (\u00a7A), it is insignificant in calculating the spectra under conditions that are of interest\nto us. As noted by Coppi & Blandford (1990), e \u2212 e\nbremsstrahlung is also insignificant under the same conditions, and is therefore not included in the calculations.\nWe assume no photon escape during the dynamical\ntime, tdyn , and instantaneous photon release at the end\nof the dynamical time. This approximation is justified\nsince the dynamical time is equal to the light crossing\ntime. If \u03c4T , the optical depth to Thompson scattering by electrons or by the created pairs at the end of\nthe dynamical time is larger than 1, the 'instantaneous\nrelease' approximation is not valid. Since the plasma\nis assumed to be heated to relativistic energy density,\nwe assume in this case that the dissipation phase is followed by a relativistic expansion phase, during which\nthe optical depth decreases. The evolution of particle\nand photon distributions is followed during the expan-\n\n\fNumerical Model\nsion phase until the optical depth for Thompson scattering, \u03c4T < 1.

For a flat photon spectrum (\u03b52 nph (\u03b5) \u221d \u03b5\u03b1 with\n\u03b1 \u2243 0), the contribution to the first integral of equation\n42 from photons at the \u2206-resonance is comparable to\nthat of photons of higher energy, thus\nZ \u221e\nc\n\u22121\ndxx\u22122 nph (x, t),\nt\u03c0 (\u03b3p , t) = 2 \u2206\u03b5\u03c3peak \u03bepeak \u03b5peak\n\u03b3p\n\u03b5peak /2\u03b3p\n(43)\nwhere \u03c3peak \u2243 5 \u00d7 10\u221228 cm2 and \u03bepeak \u2243 0.2 at the\nresonance \u03b5 = \u03b5peak = 0.3 GeV , and \u2206\u03b5 \u2243 0.2 is the\npeak width.\nThe rate of proton energy transfer to pions is given by\n\n2\nP\u03c0 (\u03b3, t) = t\u22121\n\u03c0 (\u03b3p , t) \u00d7 \u03b3p mp c .\n\n(44)\n\nThe energy loss rate of protons is calculated by numerical integration of the integral in equation 43. This calculation is carried out only in those cases where the \u2206resonance approximation is valid, and can easily be extended to any photon spectrum by explicit integration of\nthe integrals in equation 42. Roughly half of this energy\nis converted into high energy photons through the \u03c0 0 decay. Each of the created photons carry 10% of the initial\n\nproton energy, thus the photon production rate is given\nby\nR\u03c0 (\u03b5 = \u03b3p mp c2 /10, t) = 5t\u22121\n\u03c0 (\u03b3p , t)np (\u03b3p , t),\n\n(45)\n\nwhere np (\u03b3p ) is the number density of protons at energy\n\u03b3p mp c2 . Half of the energy lost by protons is converted\ninto \u03c0 + , that decays into positron and neutrinos, \u03c0 + \u2192\n\u03bc+ + \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 e+ + \u03bde + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc + \u03bd\u03bc . The \u03c0 + 's energy is roughly\nevenly distributed between the decay products, thus the\npositron carries 5% of the initial proton energy, and the\npositron production rate is given by\nQ\u03c0 (\u03b3 = \u03b3p (mp /me )/20, t) = 2.5t\u22121\n\u03c0 (\u03b3p , t)np (\u03b3p , t). (46)\nEquations 45, 46 provide only a crude approximation\nto the spectrum of high energy photons and positrons\nproduced by pion decay. However, photons and positrons\nthat are created by pion decay are typically very energetic, and participate in the high energy electro-magnetic\ncascade. Since these particles and photons' energy is\nspread among the cascade products, and the final cascade spectrum has only weak dependence on the initial\nspectrum, it is appropriate to use the approximate expressions in equations 45 and 46.\n3. NUMERICAL APPROACH\n\nSeveral integration methods are used in solving the kinetic equations. Simple, first order difference scheme was\nfound adequate, except when dealing with synchrotron\nself absorption and with the evolution of the rapid high\nenergy electro-magnetic cascades. Synchrotron self absorption calculations are carried using Cranck-Nickolson\nsecond order integration scheme (see Press et al. 1992).\nThe particle and photon distributions are discretized,\nspanning the energy range relevant to the problem. Note\nthat in the problems involved, this energy range can extend over 20 decades (see \u00a74 below). Spectra of cyclosynchrotron emission (eqs. 12, 13), Compton scattering (eqs. 19, 27) and pair production (eq. 28) are precalculated and stored in tables.\nFollowing simultaneously the evolution of the rapid\nhigh energy electro-magnetic cascade and the much\nslower evolution of low energy processes, is difficult. The\n'stationary' approximation used in previous works in\ntreating the evolution of high energy particles (see, e.g.,\nFabian et al. 1986; Lightman & Zdziarski 1987; Coppi\n1992) can not be used, due to the non-linear nature of the\ncascade: As an energetic particle loses its energy, many\nsecondaries are created, which, in turn, serve as primaries\nfor further development of the cascade. As the cascade\nevolution is powered by inverse Compton scattering, pair\nproduction and annihilation, the injection rate of energetic photons and pairs depends on the entire particle\nand photon spectra.\nTherefore, in treating this problem, a fixed time step is\nchosen, typically 10\u22124.5 times the dynamical time. Numerical integration is carried out with this fixed time\nstep. At each time step, the cascade evolution is followed\ndirectly. Direct numerical integration is carried out only\nfor the electrons, positrons and photons for which the\nenergy loss time or annihilation time are longer than\nthe fixed time step. Electrons, positrons and photons\nfor which the energy loss time or annihilation time are\nshorter than the fixed time step, are assumed to lose all\ntheir energy in a single time step, producing secondaries.\n\n\fNumerical Model\nThe secondaries' spectra are determined by the spectra\nof the various physical processes, as presented in \u00a72, and\nby the relative rates of these processes. We discriminate\nbetween high energy secondaries, which are secondaries\nfor which the energy loss time or annihilation time are\nshorter than the fixed time step, and low energy secondaries which lose their energy or annihilate on a time\nscale longer than the fixed time step. The calculation\nis repeated for the high energy secondaries, which are\ntreated as a source of lower energy particles, until all\nthe cascade energy is transferred to low energy particles.\nSince in each step of the cascade calculation, part of the\nenergy is transferred into low energy particles which do\nnot participate in the cascade, convergence is guaranteed. In order to check for convergence of this method,\nwe repeat the complete calculation with a shorter time\nstep.\nThe time derivative of particle distributions due to\nsynchrotron emission and Compton scattering is calculated by solving the continuity equation, \u2202n(\u03b3, t)/\u2202t =\n\u2202j(\u03b3, t)/\u2202E, where j(\u03b3, t) \u2261 n(\u03b3, t)P (\u03b3), and P (\u03b3) is the\nemitted power (see eq. 1). In solving this equation, flux\nlimiter is used to ensure convergence for large time steps,\nand Neumann boundary conditions for the flux j(\u03b3, t) at\nthe boundary points are used. The rate of change of\nparticle distributions due to pair production and annihilation are calculated using eqs. 28, 39. Conservation of\nparticle number and energy is forced using Lagrange multiplier method. This method was found to allow faster\nconvergence (larger time steps).\nAt the low end of the particle spectrum, electrons and\npositrons gain energy via direct Compton scattering, on\na timescale shorter than the fixed time step. In parallel\nto gaining energy, these particles lose energy via synchrotron emission on a much longer time scale, thus providing another challenge to numerical integration. Defining 'very low energy particles' as particles that gain energy on a time scale shorter than the fixed time step, we\ntreat this problem in the following way. At each time\nstep, calculation of the number density of these particle is repeated iteratively, until the particle distribution\nconverges, and the total emissivity equals the absorption.\nAt each of the iteration steps, the calculated emissivity\nand absorption are stored, and used in the calculation of\nthe photon emission from these particles. Convergence\nof this method as well is checked by repeating the calculation with smaller time step.\n4. EXAMPLES OF NUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nWe give below several examples of the results of numerical calculations of GRB prompt emission spectra. Detailed description of numerical results of prompt emission\nspectra and early afterglow emission spectra are found in\nPe'er & Waxman (2004b,c). Our calculations are done\nin the framework of the fireball model (see, e.g., Piran\n2000; M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2002; Waxman 2003), where the emission results from electron acceleration to ultra-relativistic\nenergies by internal shocks within an expanding wind.\n4.1. Basic assumptions, plasma conditions and particle\n\nacceleration\nWe calculate the emergent spectra following a single\ncollision between two plasma shells. Denoting by \u0393 the\ncharacteristic wind Lorentz factor, and assuming varia-\n\n7\n\ntion \u2206\u0393/\u0393 \u223c 1 on a time scale \u2206t, two shells collide at\nradius ri = 2\u03932 c\u2206t. For \u2206\u0393/\u0393 \u223c 1, two mildly relativistic (\u0393s \u2212 1 \u223c 1 in the wind frame) shocks are formed,\none propagating forward into the slower shell ahead, and\none propagating backward (in the wind frame) into the\nfaster shell behind. The comoving shell width, measured\nin the shell rest frame, is \u2206R = \u0393c\u2206t, and the comoving\ndynamical time, the characteristic time for shock crossing and shell expansion measured in the shell rest frame,\nis tdyn = \u0393\u2206t. The shock waves, which propagate at\nrelativistic velocity vs \u223c c in the plasma rest frame, dissipate the plasma kinetic energy and accelerate particles\nto high energies. Since the shock velocity is time independent during tdyn , the shock-heated comoving plasma\nvolume is assumed to increase linearly with time, i.e.,\nconstant particle number density is assumed.\nUnder these assumptions, the shocked plasma conditions are determined by six free parameters. Three are\nrelated to the underlying source: the total luminosity\nL = 1052 L52 erg s\u22121 , the Lorentz factor of the shocked\nplasma, \u0393 = 102.5 \u03932.5 , and the variability time \u2206t =\n10\u22124 \u2206t\u22124 s. Three additional parameters are related\nto the collisionless-shock microphysics: The fraction of\npost shock thermal energy carried by electrons \u01ebe =\n10\u22120.5 \u01ebe,0.5 and by magnetic field, \u01ebB = 10\u22120.5 \u01ebB,0.5 , and\nthe power law index of the accelerated electrons' Lorentz\nfactor distribution, d log ne /d log \u03b3 = \u2212p assumed to extend over the range \u03b3min \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b3max .\nThe comoving proton number density is\nL\n\u22122\n\u22123\nnp \u2248\n= 6.7 \u00d7 1014 L52 \u0393\u22126\n.\n2.5 \u2206t\u22124 cm\n4\u03c0ri2 c\u03932 mp c2\n(47)\nThe internal energy density is uint = L/(4\u03c0ri2 c\u03932 ), resulting in a magnetic field,\nr\n\u01ebB L\n1/2 1/2\n\u22121\nB=\n= 2.9 \u00d7 106 L52 \u01ebB,\u22120.5 \u0393\u22123\n2.5 \u2206t\u22124 G.\n2\u03936 c2 \u2206t2\n(48)\n4.1.1. Particle acceleration\n\nSince the details of the acceleration mechanism are\nnot yet known, we adopt the common assumption of\na power law energy distribution of the accelerated electrons Lorentz factor, \u03b3. The power law index p of the\naccelerated particles is a free parameter of the model.\nThe maximum Lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons, \u03b3max is obtained by equating the acceleration time,\ntacc = \u03b3me c2 /cqB, and the synchrotron cooling time,\n1/2\ntsyn = 9m3e c5 /4q 4 B 2 \u03b3, to obtain \u03b3max = (6\u03c0q/\u03c3T B) .\nThe accelerated particles assume a power law energy distribution above a minimum Lorentz factor \u03b3min , which is\nobtained by simultaneously solving\nR \u03b3max dne\nne = \u03b3min\nd\u03b5 d\u03b5,\nR \u03b3max dn\n(49)\nue = \u03b3min \u03b5 d\u03b5e d\u03b5,\n\nwhere ne and ue \u2261 \u01ebe uint are the number and energy\ndensities of the electrons. The injected particle distribution below \u03b3min is assumed thermal with temperature\n\u03b8 \u2261 kT /me c2 = 3\u03b3min , and exponential cutoff is assumed\nabove \u03b3max . In the results shown below, no proton acceleration is assumed.\nOur calculations are carried in the plasma (comoving) frame. The particle distributions are discretized,\n\n\f8\n\nPeer & Waxman\n\nspanning total of 10 decades of energy, (\u03b3\u03b2min = 10\u22123\nto \u03b3\u03b2max = 107 ).

Low compactness\nWe examined the dependence of the emergent spectrum on the uncertain values of the free parameters of\nthe model. We found that the spectral shape strongly\ndepends on the dimensionless compactness parameter l,\ndefined by l \u2261 L\u03c3T /Rme c3 , where L is the luminosity, and R is a characteristic length of the object. For\nlow value of the comoving compactness, l\u2032 . 10, the\noptical depth to pair production and to scattering by\npairs is smaller than 1 (Pe'er & Waxman 2004b), thus\nsynchrotron-SSC emission model provides fairly good approximation of the resulting spectrum. Therefore, before\napplying our model to examine realistic scenario, (i.e.,\ncomparison with observations), we first compare our numerical results to the analytical model predictions, in\nparameter space region where the later are valid. Figure\n1 presents numerical results in this case, where a power\nlow index p = 3 was used to allow the synchrotron and\nCompton peaks to be distinctively apparent.\nThe synchrotron peak presented in Figure 1 at \u03b5ob.\npeak \u2243\n10 keV is in excellent agreement with the analytical results of the optically thin synchrotron model prediction,\n3 qB 2\n\u03b5ob.\npeak = ~ 2 me c \u03b3min \u0393\n1/2\n1/2\n\u22122\n\u2206t\u22121\n= 1.4 \u00d7 104 L52 \u01eb2e,\u22120.5 \u01ebB,\u22120.5 \u03932.5\n\u22122 eV,\n(50)\nwhere \u03b3min \u2243 \u01ebe (mp /me )(p \u2212 2)/(p \u2212 1) was used.

The self absorption\nfrequency, \u03b5ob.\nssa \u2243 100 eV , is somewhat lower than the\nself absorption frequency predicted for a pure power law\ndistribution of the electrons,\n2/3\n\n1/3\n\n1/3\n\n\u22128/3\n\n\u03b5ob.\nssa = 600 L52 \u01ebe,\u22120.5 \u01ebB,\u22120.5 \u03932.5\n\n\u22121\n\u2206t\u22122\neV, (51)\n\nwhere a power law index p = 2 for particles below \u03b3min\nis assumed. This discrepancy is due to the fact that\nthe low energy particles are not power-law distributed,\nbut have a quasi-Maxwellian distribution due to photon\nreabsorption (see figure 2).\nWithout pair production, the SSC model predictions of the Compton scattering peak, at \u03b5ob.\nIC,peak =\n2\n\u03b3min\n\u03b5ob.\n=\n1.3\nGeV\n,\nagrees\nwell\nwith\nthe\nnumerical\nrepeak\nsult \u03b5ob.\n=\n1.5\nGeV\n.\nThe\n1\nGeV\nflux\nis\ncomparable\nIC,peak\nto the flux at 10 keV, as predicted by analytic calculations based on the Compton y parameter, y = 1 in the\nscenario presented in figure 1.\nPair production causes a cutoff at high energies. For\na flat spectrum, \u03b52 nph (\u03b5) \u221d \u03b50 (which is a good approximation provided \u01ebB is not much below equipartition), the\noptical depth to pair production is well approximated by\n3\n\u03c3T\n\u03c4\u03b3\u03b3 (\u03b5) = \u2206Rnph (\u03b5) 16\nU\nph\n3\n\u03c3T ,\n= \u0393c\u2206t \u0010 \u03b5max \u0011 (me\u03b5c2 )2 16\nlog\n\n\u03b5peak\n\n(52)\n\nand is larger than unity at\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b5max\nob.\n8\n\u03b5\u0303\u03c4 \u2265 3 \u00d7 10 log\n\u03b5peak\n\n\u22121\n6\nL\u22121\n52 \u01ebe,\u22120.5 \u03932.5 \u2206t\u22122 eV,\n\n(53)\nin an excellent agreement with the numerical results.\nHere Uph is the photon energy density, given by Uph \u2248\n\u01ebe L/4\u03c0ri2 c\u03932 . For this value of the compactness, pair\nannihilation does not play a significant role, while scattering by the created pairs flattens the spectrum at\n10 keV \u2212 1 GeV .\nEven though the analytic approximation is in a fairly\ngood agreement with the numerical calculations, there\nare important discrepancies between the analytic approximation and the numerical calculation. The electron distribution shows a peak at \u03b3 \u223c 1.05 (\u03b2 \u223c 0.3), resulting in a deviation of the self absorption frequency from\nthe analytic calculation. These electrons affect the high\nenergy spectrum by Compton scattering, resulting in a\nnearly flat (\u03b1 \u223c 0) spectrum above 10 keV . We showed\n(Pe'er & Waxman 2004b) that the spectrum is nearly\nindependent on the power law index of the accelerated\nelectrons, p.\n4.3. High compactness\nFigure 3 shows an example of our numerical results for\nlarge comoving compactness, l\u2032 = 250. At large value\nof the compactness parameter, l\u2032 > 30, the synchrotronSSC model predictions do not provide an appropriate\ndescription of the spectrum. Therefore, the numerical\nresults may provide some insight on the inconsistency\nbetween some of the observations and the analytical predictions, as mentioned in \u00a71.\nIn the scenario of large compactness, Compton scattering by pairs becomes the dominant emission mechanism. Both electrons and positrons lose their energy\nmuch faster than the dynamical time, and a quasiMaxwellian distribution with an effective temperature\n\u03b8 \u2261 kT /me c2 \u2243 0.05 \u2212 0.1 is formed. Photons upscattered by the pairs create the peak at \u0393\u03b8me c2 \u223c 5 MeV .\nThe results shown in Figure 3 are not corrected for the\nfact that the optical depth to scattering by pairs is large,\n\u03c4\u00b1 \u223c 10 (see \u00a72). Therefore, the emergent spectral\npeak is expect to be at lower energy, at \u223c 1 MeV (for\ndetailed discussion see Pe'er & Waxman 2004b). The\nmoderate Compton y parameter, y \u2243 4\u03b8\u03c4 \u2248 4\u03b8\u22121 \u03c41 results in a spectral slope \u03bdF\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 with \u03b1 \u2248 0.5 between \u03b5ssa \u2248 3 keV and \u03b5peak \u2248 5 MeV . The peak at\n\u0393me c2 \u223c 102 \u03932.5 MeV is formed by pair annihilation.\nThe self absorption frequency, \u03b5ssa \u2243 3 keV is well below the prediction for a power law index p = 2 of particles\nbelow \u03b3min . This is attributed to the quasi-Maxwellian\ndistribution of particles at low energies (see Figure 2).\nThe inverse Compton peak flux is lower than the synchrotron peak flux, due to the Klein-Nishina suppression\nat high energies.\nEven though the results presented here are for illustrative purposes only, and are not aimed to explain a\nparticular observation, we note that the obtained numerical results are is agreement with some of the observations, that were found inconsistent with the optically thin\nsynchrotron- SSC model predictions. Examples are the\nsteep slopes observed at low energies (Preece et al. 1998;\nFrontera et al. 2000; Ghirlanda, Celotti & Ghisellini\n\n\fNumerical Model\n\u22126\n\n\u22126\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\nsec ]\n\n\u22121\n\nsec ]\n\n10\n\n\u22127\n\n\u22127\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\nFlux, \u03bd F\u03bd [erg cm\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22128\n\n\u03bd\n\nFlux, \u03bd F [erg cm\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\u22129\n\n\u22128\n\n10\n\n\u22129\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\n10\n\nObs. energy [eV]\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\nObs. energy [eV]\n\nFig. 1.- Time averaged GRB prompt emission spectra obtained\nafter 2 shells collision, characterized by low compactness parameter.

SUMMARY & DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe described a time dependent numerical model which\ncalculates emission of radiation from relativistic plasma,\ncomposed of homogeneous and isotropic distributions of\nelectrons, positrons, protons and photons, and permeated by a time independent magnetic field. We assume\nthe existence of a dissipation process, which produces\nenergetic particles at constant rates. The particles interact via cyclo-synchrotron emission, synchrotron self\n\nabsorption, inverse and direct Compton scattering, e\u00b1\npair production and annihilation, and photo-meson interactions which produce energetic photons and positrons\nfollowing the decay of energetic pions. Exact cross sections valid at all energies, including the Klein-Nishina\nsuppression at high energies, are used in describing the\nphysical processes. Exact spectra are used in describing\ncyclo-synchrotron emission, synchrotron self absorption,\nCompton scattering and pair production, and approximate spectra are used in the description of pair annihilation.\nWe explained in \u00a73 our unique integration method,\nwhich overcomes the challenge of the many orders of\nmagnitude difference in characteristic time scales. We\npresented the various integration techniques used for\nsolving the kinetic equations describing the evolution of\nparticle and photon distributions at all energy scales. By\nfollowing directly the development of the rapid, high energy electro-magnetic cascades at each time step, we obtain the spectrum at high energies, up to \u2265 100 TeV .\nOur method enables to follow the development of the\nspectrum created in the parameter space region of large\ncompactness, where no analytic approximation is valid.\nThis method also improves over previous ones by providing a more accurate treatment of photon emission and\nabsorption in the presence of magnetic fields.\nWe have given several examples of numerical calculations in \u00a74. In parameter space regions where analytical\napproximations are valid, our numerical results are in\ngood agreement with analytic results. We have pointed\nout some significant discrepancies between the analytical approximations and the numerical calculation, and\nexplained their origin. We presented examples of new results for parameter space regions where analytic approximations are not valid. We pointed out that our results\nare consistent with numerous observations, including observations that are inconsistent with the optically thin\n\n\f10\n\nPeer & Waxman\n\nsynchrotron-SSC model predictions. Further results of\nour study of GRB prompt emission and early afterglow\nemission can be found in Pe'er & Waxman (2004b,c).\nThe next generation high energy detectors, such\nas SWIFT6 and GLAST7 satellites, and the sub-TeV\nground based Cerenkov detectors, such as MAGIC8 ,\nHESS9 VERITAS10 and CANGAROO III11 are expected\nto increase the GRB prompt emission and early afterglow\n\nemission detection rate by an order of magnitude, to allow detection of > GeV emission from GRB's, and to\ndetect the high energy spectra of thousands of AGN's at\nvarious distances. Thus, detailed numerical models, that\nare capable of producing accurate spectra over a wide energy scale, are necessary for analyzing and understanding\nthe experimental data.\n\n6\n\nhttp://www.swift.psu.edu\nhttp://www-glast.stanford.edu\nhttp://hegra1.mppmu.mpg.de/MAGICWeb\n9 http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/HESS.html\n10 http://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/\n11 http://icrhp9.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/\n7\n8\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nCOULOMB SCATTERING\nIn the limit of relativistic particle scattering off cool thermal pair distribution (\u03b8 \u226a 1, \u03b3 \u226b 1), the energy loss rate of\n2\n\u22121\nthe relativistic particle can be approximated by d\u03b3/dt \u2248 \u22123/2\u03c3T cn\u00b1 ln \u039b, or t\u22121\nln \u039b\nee \u2261 \u2212(1/\u03b3)d\u03b3/dt \u2248 4\u03c0cr0 n\u00b1 \u03b3\n(Gould 1975), where n\u00b1 is the number density of the thermal pairs. The relevant value of the Coulomb logarithm \u039b,\nis \u039b \u2248 \u03b3 1/2 me c2 /h\u03c9p , where \u03c9p = (4\u03c0n\u00b1 e2 /me )1/2 is the plasma frequency.\nAssuming that the pairs' energy distribution is thermal, that their number density is n\u00b1 \u2261 f np where np is the\nproton number density, and that np \u2248 uint /mp c2 where uint is the internal energy density, comparing the Coulomb\ncooling time and the synchrotron cooling time, tsyn = 9m3e c5 /4q 4 B 2 \u03b3, using B 2 = 8\u03c0\u01ebB uint , gives\ntsyn\n9 me f ln \u039b\n1\n=\n\u2243 2 f1 \u01eb\u22121\nB,\u22120.5 ,\ntee\n8 mp \u01eb B \u03b3 2\n3\u03b3\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere typical values f = 10f1 , and ln \u039b \u2248 20 assumed. It is therefore concluded that for relativistic electrons, and for\nmagnetic field not many orders of magnitude below equipartition, electrons lose their energy by synchrotron emission\non a time scale much shorter than the energy loss time by Coulomb scattering. A more accurate approximation of tee\n(Haug 1988; Coppi & Blandford 1990), does not change this result.\nREFERENCES\nBand, D., et al. 1993, ApJ, 413, 281\nBaring, M.G., & Braby, M.L. 2004, ApJ, 613, 460\nBekefi, G. 1966, Radiation Processes in Plasmas (New York: Wiley)\nBlumenthal, G.R., & Gould, R.J. 1970, Review of Modern Physics,\n42, 237\nBonometto, S., & Rees, M.J. 1971, MNRAS, 152, 21\nB\u00f6tcher, M., & Schlickeiser, R. 1997, A&A, 325, 866\nBurns, M.L., & Lovelace, R.V.E. 1982, ApJ, 262, 87\nCoppi, P.S. 1992, MNRAS, 258, 657\nCoppi, P.S., & Blandford, R.D. 1990, MNRAS, 245, 453\nFabian, A.C., Blandford, R.D., Guilbert, P.W., Phinney, E.S., &\nCuellar, L. 1986, MNRAS, 221, 931\nFrontera, F., et al. 2000, ApJS, 127, 59\nGhirlanda, G., Celotti, A., & Ghisellini, G. 2003, A&A, 406, 879\nGhisellini, G., Guilbert, P.W., & Svensson, R. 1988, ApJ, 334, L5\nGinzburg, V.L., & Syrovatskii, S.I. 1965, ARA&A, 3, 297\nGinzburg, V.L., & Syrovatskii, S.I. 1969, ARA&A, 7, 375\nGonzalez, M.M., et al. 2003, Nature, 424, 749\nGould, R.J. 1975, ApJ, 196, 689\nGould, R.J., & Schr\u00e9der, G.P. 1967, Physical Review, 155, 1404\nGruzinov, A. & Waxman, E. 1999, ApJ, 511, 852\nGuilbert, P.W., Fabian, A.c., & Rees, M.J. 1983 MNRAS, 205, 593\nHaug, E. 1988, A&A, 191, 181\nJones, F.C. 1968, Physical Review, 167, 1159\nLang, K.R. 1999, Astrophysical Formulae, (Springer)\nLightman, A.P., & Zdziarski, A.A. 1987, ApJ, 319, 643\nMahadevan, R., Narayan, R., & Yi, I. 1996, ApJ, 465, 327\nMcCray, R. 1969, ApJ, 156, 329\nM\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, P. 2002, ARA&A 40, 137\n\nM\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, P., & Rees, M.J. 1997, ApJ, 476, 232\nPaczy\u0144ski, B., & Rhoads, J.E. 1993, ApJ, 418, L5\nPanaitescu, A., & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, P. 1998, ApJ, 501, 702\nPe'er, A., & Waxman, E. 2004a, ApJ, 603, L1\nPe'er, A., & Waxman, E. 2004b, ApJ, 613, 448\nPe'er,\nA., &\nWaxman,\nE.\n2004c,\nApJ,\nsubmitted\n(astro-ph/0407084)\nPilla, R.
