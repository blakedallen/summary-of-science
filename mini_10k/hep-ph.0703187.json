Introduction\nVery recently, the KLOE Collaboration has reported a new measurement of the ratio\nR\u03c6 \u2261 B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3)/B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3) [1]. Combining the value of R\u03c6 with other constraints,\nthey have estimated the gluonium content of the \u03b7 \u2032 meson as Z\u03b72\u2032 = 0.14 \u00b1 0.04, which\npoints to a significant gluonium fraction in the \u03b7 \u2032 wave function incompatible with zero by\nmore than 3\u03c3. This new result contrasts with the former value Z\u03b72\u2032 = 0.06+0.09\n\u22120.06 , which was\ncompatible with zero within 1\u03c3 and consistent with a gluonium fraction below 15% [2].\nBoth experimental analysis obtain their results using the same set of constraints derived\nfrom other measured ratios, namely1 \u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3)/\u0393(\u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3), \u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3)/\u0393(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3)\nand \u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3)/\u0393(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3), as well as R\u03c6 . The sole difference between the two analyses,\napart from the obvious improvement in the precision of the new measurements, is the\ninclusion in the amplitudes of Ref. [1] of two extra parameters to deal with the overlap of\nthe vector and pseudoscalar meson wave functions produced in the transitions V \u2192 P \u03b3 or\nP \u2192 V \u03b3, a feature first introduced in Ref. [3]. However, the new analysis of Ref. [1] uses\nthe most recent experimental data taken from Ref. [4] in association with the values for\nthe parameters related to the overlap which were obtained in Ref. [3] from a fit to available\nexperimental data at that time. Therefore, a reanalysis of this uncomfortable situation is\nneeded before drawing definite conclusions on the gluon content of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons.\nThe purpose of this work is to perform a phenomenological analysis of radiative V \u2192 P \u03b3\nand P \u2192 V \u03b3 decays, with V = \u03c1, K \u2217 , \u03c9, \u03c6 and P = \u03c0, K, \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 , aimed at determining\n1\n\nThe analysis in Ref. [2] did not contain the constraint imposed by \u0393(\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3)/\u0393(\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03b3). Nevertheless, the inclusion of this constraint does not change the main results of the analysis, as seen in Ref. [1].\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fthe gluonic content of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 wave functions. Similar analysis were driven in the\nseminal work by Rosner [5], where the allowed gluonic admixture in the \u03b7 was found to\nbe small, |Z\u03b7 | . 0.4, but not necessarily zero. The gluonic content of the \u03b7 \u2032 could not be\nestablished due to the lack of data on \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3. Later on, Kou pointed out that the \u03b7 \u2032\ngluonic component might be as large as 26% [6]. These two works also included in their\nanalysis the constraints provided by P \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 with P = \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 . Here, we will not take into\naccount these decays since they are nicely described in a two mixing angle scheme, as shown\nin Refs. [7, 8]. A more recent analysis studying the pseudoscalar glueball-q q\u0304 mixing from\nJ/\u03c8(\u03c8 \u2032 ) \u2192 V P decays gets |Z\u03b7 | = 0.042 and |Z\u03b7\u2032 | = 0.161 [9].\nIn Sec. 2, we briefly introduce the notation. The model for V P \u03b3 M 1 transitions to\nbe used in our analysis is presented in Sec. 3. This model includes the overlap of vector\nand pseudoscalar wave functions as a main ingredient [3]. As stated above, the use of old\nvalues for the overlap parameters in addition to the latest data may be at the origin of the\ndiscrepancy concerning the gluon content of the \u03b7 \u2032 between the two KLOE analyses [1, 2].\nSec. 4 is devoted to the data fitting of the most recent V \u2192 P \u03b3 and P \u2192 V \u03b3 experimental\ndata with the aim of finding the gluonic admixture in the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 wave functions. As a\nmatter of comparison with other approaches, a graphical representation of our main results\nis shown in Sec. 5. Finally, in Sec. 6 we summarize our work and present the conclusions.\nA decomposition of the mixing parameters in terms of Euler angles is left for App. A.\n\n2.

A model for V P \u03b3 M 1 transitions\nWe will work in a conventional quark model context and assume that pseudoscalar and\nvector mesons are simple quark-antiquark S-wave bound states. All these hadrons are thus\nextended objects with characteristic spatial extensions fixed by their respective quarkantiquark P or V wave functions. In the pseudoscalar nonet, P = \u03c0, K, \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 , the quark\nspins are antiparallel and the mixing pattern is given by Eq. (2.1). In the vector case,\nV = \u03c1, K \u2217 , \u03c9, \u03c6, the spins are parallel and mixing is similarly given by Eq. (2.3). We will\nwork in the good SU (2) limit with mu = md \u2261 m\u0304 and with identical spatial extension of\nwave functions within each P and each V isomultiplet. SU (3) will be broken in the usual\nmanner taking constituent quark masses with ms > m\u0304 but also, and this is a specific feature\nof our approach, allowing for different spatial extensions for each P and V isomultiplet.\nFinally, we will consider that even if gluon annihilation channels may induce \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing,\nthey play a negligible r\u00f4le in V P \u03b3 transitions and thus fully respect the usual OZI-rule.\nIn our specific case of V P \u03b3 M 1 transitions, these generic statements translate into\nthree characteristic ingredients of the model:\ni) A V P \u03b3 magnetic dipole transition proceeds via quark or antiquark spin-flip amplitudes proportional to \u03bcq = eq /2mq . Apart from the obvious quark charge values,\nthis effective magnetic moment breaks SU (3) in a well defined way and distinguishes\nphoton emission from strange or non-strange quarks via ms > m\u0304.\nii) The spin-flip V \u2194 P conversion amplitude has then to be corrected by the relative\noverlap between the P and V wave functions. In older papers [10, 11] a common,\nflavour-independent overlap was introduced. Today, with a wider set of improved\ndata, this new symmetry breaking mechanism can be introduced without enlarging\nexcessively the number of free parameters.\niii) Indeed, the OZI-rule reduces considerably the possible transitions and their respective\nV P wave-function overlaps: Cs , Cq and C\u03c0 characterize the h\u03b7s |\u03c6s i, h\u03b7q |\u03c9q i = h\u03b7q |\u03c1i\nand h\u03c0|\u03c9q i = h\u03c0|\u03c1i spatial overlaps, respectively. Notice that distinction is made\nbetween the |\u03c0i and |\u03b7q i spatial extension due to the gluon or U (1)A anomaly affecting\nthe second state. Independently, we will also need CK for the hK|K \u2217 i overlap between\nstrange isodoublets.\nIt is then a trivial task to write all the V P \u03b3 couplings in terms of an effective g \u2261 g\u03c9q \u03c0\u03b3 :\ng\u03c10 \u03c00 \u03b3 = g\u03c1+ \u03c0+ \u03b3 = 31 g , g\u03c9\u03c0\u03b3 = g cos \u03c6V , g\u03c6\u03c0\u03b3 = g sin \u03c6V ,\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010\n1\nm\u0304\nm\u0304\n,\ng\n\u2217+\n+\n=\n,\n2\n\u2212\ngK \u22170 K 0 \u03b3 = \u2212 13 g zK 1 + m\ng\nz\nK\nK K \u03b3\n3\nms\ns\ng\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3 = g zq X\u03b7 ,\n\ng\u03c1\u03b7\u2032 \u03b3 = g zq X\u03b7\u2032 ,\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n(3.1)\n\n\f\u0011\n\u0010\ng\u03c9\u03b7\u03b3 = 31 g zq X\u03b7 cos \u03c6V + 2 mm\u0304s zs Y\u03b7 sin \u03c6V ,\n\u0011\n\u0010\ng\u03c9\u03b7\u2032 \u03b3 = 31 g zq X\u03b7\u2032 cos \u03c6V + 2 mm\u0304s zs Y\u03b7\u2032 sin \u03c6V ,\n\u0011\n\u0010\ng\u03c6\u03b7\u03b3 = 13 g zq X\u03b7 sin \u03c6V \u2212 2 mm\u0304s zs Y\u03b7 cos \u03c6V ,\n\u0011\n\u0010\ng\u03c6\u03b7\u2032 \u03b3 = 13 g zq X\u03b7\u2032 sin \u03c6V \u2212 2 mm\u0304s zs Y\u03b7\u2032 cos \u03c6V ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere we have redefined zq \u2261 Cq /C\u03c0 , zs \u2261 Cs /C\u03c0 and zK \u2261 CK /C\u03c0 .

Data fitting\nWe proceed to fit our theoretical expressions for the amplitudes in Eqs. (3.1,3.2) comparing\nthe available experimental information on \u0393(V \u2192 P \u03b3) and \u0393(P \u2192 V \u03b3) taken exclusively\nfrom Ref. [4] with the corresponding decay widths in Eq. (3.3). Looking at these amplitudes,\none immediately realizes that the overlapping parameters zq,s and the mixing parameters\nX\u03b7,(\u03b7\u2032 ) and Y\u03b7,(\u03b7\u2032 ) always appear in pairs, namely, zq X\u03b7,(\u03b7\u2032 ) and zs Y\u03b7,(\u03b7\u2032 ) . Constraining\nthese four different combinations will fix four parameters at most. However, there are five\nindependent parameters to be fixed from them, viz. zq,s and the three mixing parameters\nrelated to the most general case of accepting a gluonic admixture in both the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032\nmesons (see below). So, either we fix the z's to unity and then constrain the three mixing\nparameters of the general case, or we leave the z's free and then we are restricted to allow\nfor gluonium either in the \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 wave function only. In the following, we consider these\npossibilities. Both are interesting since a comparison of their results will allow us to check\nthe relevance of taking into consideration the overlapping parameters, which are specific of\nour approach. Furthermore, leaving the z's free will permit us to fix the gluonic content\nof the \u03b7 \u2032 in a way identical to the experimental measurement by KLOE, that is, under the\nhypothesis of no gluonium in the \u03b7 wave function. Unfortunately, due to the pairing of\nparameters mentioned above, a simultaneous fit of the z's and the gluonic admixture in\nthe \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 is not possible.\nAs shown in detail in App. A, due to the orthonormality conditions in Eqs. (A.2,A.3)\nthe mixing pattern of \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 is described by means of three independent parameters,\nwhich we choose to be X\u03b7 , X\u03b7\u2032 and Y\u03b7\u2032 . Accordingly, the parameters related to the gluonic\ncontent, Z\u03b7 and Z\u03b7\u2032 , and Y\u03b7 are written in terms of the former ones as\nq\n2\n2\n|Z\u03b7,(\u03b7\u2032 ) | = 1 \u2212 X\u03b7,(\u03b7\n\u2032 ) \u2212 Y\u03b7,(\u03b7 \u2032 ) ,\nq\n(4.1)\nX\u03b7 X\u03b7\u2032 Y\u03b7\u2032 + (1 \u2212 X\u03b72\u2032 \u2212 Y\u03b72\u2032 )(1 \u2212 X\u03b72 \u2212 X\u03b72\u2032 )\n.\nY\u03b7 = \u2212\n1 \u2212 X\u03b72\u2032\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fThe mixing parameters can also be expressed in terms of three angles, \u03c6P , \u03c6\u03b7G and \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G ,\nthe two latter weighting the gluonic admixture in the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 , respectively. Using this\nangular parametrization one gets\nX\u03b7 = cos \u03c6P cos \u03c6\u03b7G ,\n\nX\u03b7\u2032 = sin \u03c6P cos \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G \u2212 cos \u03c6P sin \u03c6\u03b7G sin \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G ,\n\nY\u03b7 = \u2212 sin \u03c6P cos \u03c6\u03b7G ,\n\nY\u03b7\u2032 = cos \u03c6P cos \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G + sin \u03c6P sin \u03c6\u03b7G sin \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G ,\n\nZ\u03b7 = \u2212 sin \u03c6\u03b7G ,\n\n(4.2)\n\nZ\u03b7\u2032 = \u2212 sin \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G cos \u03c6\u03b7G .\n\nFits to experimental data are performed imposing the constraints in Eq. (4.1) or, equivalently, using the decomposition in Eq. (4.2).\nWe start considering the first of the possibilities noted before. Thus, we assume that\nthe overlap of the P and V wave functions is flavour-independent, i.e. Cq = Cs = CK = C\u03c0\nand hence zq = zs = zK = 1. The fit in this case is very poor, \u03c72 /d.o.f.=31.2/6. The\nquality of the fit gets worse when \u03c6\u03b7G and \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G are set to zero, \u03c72 /d.o.f.=45.9/8 with\n\u03c6P = (41.1 \u00b1 1.1)\u25e6 .\nClearly, in order to obtain a good fit one has to relax the constraint imposed on the\noverlapping parameters. Hence, we begin to discuss the second of the possibilities, that is\nto say, to leave the z's free and restrict the gluon content of the \u03b7 or \u03b7 \u2032 meson. However,\nas a matter of comparison, we first consider the absence of gluonium in both mesons,\ni.e. \u03c6\u03b7G = \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G = 0. In addition, we also fix the vector mixing angle \u03c6V to its measured\nvalue tan \u03c6V = +0.059 \u00b1 0.004 or \u03c6V = (3.4 \u00b1 0.2)\u25e6 [12] and the ratio of constituent quark\nmasses to m\u0304/ms \u2243 1/1.45. The fit in this case is not yet satisfactory, \u03c72 /d.o.f.=14.0/7.\nThe quality of the fit improves when the ratio m\u0304/ms is left free, \u03c72 /d.o.f.=7.6/6 with\nms /m\u0304 = 1.24 \u00b1 0.07. If \u03c6V is also left free, the final result of the fit gives \u03c72 /d.o.f.=4.4/5\nwith\ng = 0.72 \u00b1 0.01 GeV\u22121 ,\nms\nm\u0304\n\n= 1.24 \u00b1 0.07 ,\n\n\u03c6P = (41.5 \u00b1 1.2)\u25e6 ,\n\nzq = 0.86 \u00b1 0.03 ,\n\n\u03c6V = (3.2 \u00b1 0.1)\u25e6 ,\n\nzs = 0.78 \u00b1 0.05 ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nzK = 0.89 \u00b1 0.03 .\n\nThe fitted values for the two mixing angles \u03c6P and \u03c6V are in good agreement with most\nresults coming from other analyses using complementary information (see, for instance,\nRef. [13] and references therein). Our value for the pseudoscalar mixing angle also agrees\nwith the latest measurement from KLOE, \u03c6P = (41.4 \u00b1 1.0)\u25e6 [1]. The free parameters z's\nare specific of our approach and are not fixed to one as in previous analyses [10, 11]. As\nmentioned, if we fix the z's to unity, the fit gets much worse (\u03c72 /d.o.f.=45.9/8). This shows\nthat allowing for different overlaps of quark-antiquark wave functions and, in particular,\nfor those coming from the gluon anomaly affecting only the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 singlet component, is\nindeed relevant.\nFinally, the symmetry breaking parameter ms /m\u0304 which is essential to adjust the ratio\nbetween the two K \u2217 -K transitions is affected by large uncertainties due to the difficulty\nin extracting the neutral and charged K \u2217 \u2192 K\u03b3 widths from Primakoff-effect analyses2 .\n2\n\nThe neutral and charged K \u2217 \u2192 K\u03b3 transitions have been measured only by one and two experimental\ngroups, respectively, and seem to need further confirmations [4].\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fTransition\n\ngVexp\nP \u03b3 (PDG)\n\ngVthP \u03b3 (Fit 1)\n\ngVthP \u03b3 (Fit 2)\n\n\u03c10 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3\n\n0.475 \u00b1 0.024\n\n0.461 \u00b1 0.019\n\n0.464 \u00b1 0.030\n\n0.41 \u00b1 0.03\n\n0.41 \u00b1 0.02\n\n0.40 \u00b1 0.04\n\n\u03c9 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3\n\n0.140 \u00b1 0.007\n\n0.142 \u00b1 0.007\n\n0.143 \u00b1 0.010\n\n\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3\n\n0.139 \u00b1 0.015\n\n0.149 \u00b1 0.006\n\n0.146 \u00b1 0.014\n\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3\n\n0.209 \u00b1 0.002\n\n0.209 \u00b1 0.018\n\n0.209 \u00b1 0.013\n\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u2032 \u03b3\n\n0.22 \u00b1 0.01\n\n0.22 \u00b1 0.02\n\n0.22 \u00b1 0.02\n\n\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c10 \u03b3\n\n\u22121\nTable 1: Comparison between the experimental values gVexp\n) for the various (V, P ) \u2192\nP \u03b3 (in GeV\n\u2032\n(P, V )\u03b3 transitions, with P = \u03b7, \u03b7 , taken from the PDG [4] and the corresponding predictions for\ngVthP \u03b3 from Eqs. (4.3) -Fit 1- and (4.4) -Fit 2-.\n\nFor these reasons, we have performed a new fit ignoring the two K \u2217 \u2192 K\u03b3 channels. This\nnew fit obviously gives the same results for g, \u03c6P,V and zq whereas ms /m\u0304 and zs always\nappear in the combination zs m\u0304/ms which is fitted to 0.63 \u00b1 0.02, in agreement with our\nprevious values in Eq. (4.3). Therefore, our results are insensitive to eventual modifications\nof future and desirable new data on K \u2217 \u2192 K\u03b3 transitions.\nIn Table 1, we present a comparison between experimental data for the relevant V P \u03b3\ntransitions with P = \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 and the corresponding theoretical predictions (in absolute value)\ncalculated from the fitted values in Eq. (4.3). We do not include in that comparison\nneither V \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3 nor K \u2217 \u2192 K\u03b3 modes since they are used to constrain the complementary\nparameters g, \u03c6V , ms /m\u0304 and zK . The agreement is very good and all the predictions\ncoincide with the experimental values within 1\u03c3. Notice the small experimental error for\nthe g\u03c6\u03b7\u03b3 coupling as compared to the theoretical one, which, as we will see in Sec. 5, serves\nto highly constrain the allowed values for the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle \u03c6P .\nNow that we have performed a fit under the hypothesis of no gluonium we return to\nthe main issue of this analysis, the phenomenological determination of the gluon content of\nthe \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons. As stated before, a simultaneous fit of the overlapping parameters zq,s\nand the three mixing angles \u03c6P , \u03c6\u03b7G and \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G is not feasible. Therefore, we first assume\n\u03c6\u03b7G = 0, i.e. Z\u03b7 = 0, and then proceed to fit the gluonic content of the \u03b7 \u2032 wave function\nunder this assumption. The results of the new fit are3\ng = 0.72 \u00b1 0.01 GeV\u22121 ,\n\nms\nm\u0304\n\n= 1.24 \u00b1 0.07 ,\n\n\u03c6P = (41.4 \u00b1 1.3)\u25e6 ,\nzq = 0.86 \u00b1 0.03 ,\n\n\u03c6V = (3.2 \u00b1 0.1)\u25e6 ,\n\n|\u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G | = (12 \u00b1 13)\u25e6 ,\n\nzs = 0.79 \u00b1 0.05 ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nzK = 0.89 \u00b1 0.03 ,\n\nwith \u03c72 /d.o.f.=4.2/4. The quality of the fit is similar to the one obtained assuming a\nvanishing gluonic admixture for both mesons (\u03c72 /d.o.f.=4.4/5). The fitted values for zq\n3\n\nThere is a sign ambiguity in \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G that cannot be decided since this angle enters into X\u03b7\u2032 and Y\u03b7\u2032\nthrough a cosine.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fand zs are compatible with those of Eq. (4.3). The result obtained for \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G suggests a very\nsmall amount of gluonium in the \u03b7 \u2032 wave function, in fact compatible with zero within 1\u03c3.\nUsing Eq. (A.6) to calculate Z\u03b7\u2032 from \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G gives |Z\u03b7\u2032 | = 0.2 \u00b1 0.2. This is one of the main\nresults of our analysis. Accepting the absence of gluonium for the \u03b7 meson, the gluonic\ncontent of the \u03b7 \u2032 wave function amounts to |\u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G | = (12 \u00b1 13)\u25e6 or Z\u03b72\u2032 = 0.04 \u00b1 0.09.\nIn other words, our values for \u03c6P and \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G (or Z\u03b7\u2032 ) contrast with those reported by\nKLOE recently, \u03c6P = (39.7 \u00b1 0.7)\u25e6 and |\u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G | = (22 \u00b1 3)\u25e6 -or Z\u03b72\u2032 = 0.14 \u00b1 0.04- [1]. As\nindicated in Sec. 1, a possible explanation of this discrepancy could be the use in Ref. [1]\nof old values for the overlapping parameters that the present analysis tries to update. In\nTable 1, we also include the theoretical predictions for the various transitions involving \u03b7\nor \u03b7 \u2032 calculated from the fitted values in Eq. (4.4). As expected, there is no significant\ndifference between the values obtained allowing for gluonium (Fit 2) or not (Fit 1) in the\n\u03b7 \u2032 wave function. Likewise, we predict the value of the ratio\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013\nms zq tan \u03c6V 2 p\u03b7\u2032 3\n\u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3)\n2\n2\n,\n(4.5)\n= cot \u03c6P cos \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G 1 \u2212\nR\u03c6 \u2261\n\u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3)\nm\u0304 zs sin 2\u03c6P\np\u03b7\nto be (4.7 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22123 , in agreement with the experimental value in Ref.

Consequently, we fix \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G = 0 and leave \u03c6\u03b7G free. The results\nobtained are the following:\ng = 0.72 \u00b1 0.01 GeV\u22121 ,\n\nms\nm\u0304\n\n= 1.24 \u00b1 0.07 ,\n\n\u03c6P = (41.5 \u00b1 1.3)\u25e6 ,\nzq = 0.86 \u00b1 0.04 ,\n\n\u03c6V = (3.2 \u00b1 0.1)\u25e6 ,\n(4.6)\n\n|\u03c6\u03b7G | \u2243 0\u25e6 ,\n\nzs = 0.78 \u00b1 0.06 ,\n\nzK = 0.89 \u00b1 0.03 ,\n\nwith \u03c72 /d.o.f.=4.4/4. The fitted value for \u03c6\u03b7G is very close to zero. For that reason, it\nis better to express this value in terms of the more common Z\u03b7 parameter. As a result,\none gets Z\u03b72 = 0.00 \u00b1 0.12, thus showing a vanishing gluonium contribution in the \u03b7 wave\nfunction. This is a second important result of our analysis which complements the one\ndiscussed after Eq. (4.4). To sum up, the current experimental data on V P \u03b3 transitions\nseem to indicate within our model a negligible gluonic content for the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons.\nA final exercise we have done is to check whether the very recent measurements (not\nincluded in Ref. [4]) on \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 from the SND Coll. [14] and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 from KLOE\n[1] modify the results of our analysis. The values of the couplings associated to these new\ndata are displayed in Table 2. As shown, the central values are nearly the same as those\nfrom Ref. [4], except for \u03c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3, whereas the errors for \u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 are comparable to\nthe world averages and the error for \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 is reduced by a factor of three.

However, in both\ncases the quality of the fit is as good as it was when only the experimental data provided by\nRef. [4] were considered. Moreover, the fitted values of all the parameters are compatible\nwithin 1\u03c3 with those of Eqs. (4.3,4.4). The corresponding theoretical predictions for the\ngV P \u03b3 couplings with P = \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 calculated from the fitted values in Eqs.

In conclusion,\nthe latest experimental data seem to confirm the null gluonic content of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 wave\nfunctions.\n\n5. Comparison with other approaches\nOur main results can also be displayed graphically following Refs. [1, 5, 6]. This will\nserve us to present the bounds obtained using our approach and compare them with other\napproaches. Very briefly, the analysis of Ref. [5] is based on the SU (3) quark model\nsupplemented by the SU (3) breaking parameter m\u0304/ms dealing with the difference of the\ndown and strange quark magnetic moments but without taking into account the vector\nmixing angle \u03c6V or the different vector-pseudoscalar overlapping parameters, both specific\nfeatures of our approach. The experimental analysis of Ref. [1] is based on the same\napproach including the latter two features. Finally, the analysis of Ref. [6] utilizes the\nSU (3) quark model and the vector meson dominance model (VMD). In this framework,\nthe transition amplitudes are expressed in terms of masses and decay constants affected by\nSU (3) breaking effects.\nIn Fig. 1, we plot the regions for the X\u03b7 and Y\u03b7 parameters which are allowed by the\nexperimental couplings of the \u03c1 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3, \u03c9 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 transitions (see Table 1). The\nlimits of the bands are given at 68% CL or 1\u03c3.

The\nmixing solutions corresponding to the \u03b7 being a pure octet (X\u03b7 = \u2212 \u221a12 Y\u03b7 = \u221a13 ) -open circle-\nand (X\u03b7 = Y\u03b7 = \u221a12 ) -closed circle- are shown. The straight lines for the upper and lower bounds\nof the mixing solution in absence of gluonium, \u03c6P = (41.5 \u00b1 1.2)\u25e6 , are also shown. The vertical\nand inclined bands are the regions for X\u03b7 and Y\u03b7 allowed by the experimental couplings of the\n(\u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 transitions in Table 1.\n\nzq , zs , and zK from Eq.

In addition to the bands, we have also plotted the circular\nboundary denoting the constraint X\u03b72 + Y\u03b72 \u2264 1 as well as the favoured region for the\n\u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle assuming the absence of gluonium, 40.3\u25e6 \u2264 \u03c6P \u2264 42.7\u25e6 , obtained at 1\u03c3\nfrom the corresponding fitted value in Eq. (4.3). As one can see, there exists a perfect\nintersection region of the three bands located precisely on the circumference at the region\npreferred by the mixing angle, thus indicating a vanishing gluonium contribution in the \u03b7\nwave function, i.e. |Z\u03b7 | = 0. The small size of the intersection region, mainly due to the\nsmall experimental error in the g\u03c6\u03b7\u03b3 coupling, and its precise location on the circumference\ngives strong evidence in favour of the former statement. Notice also the importance of\nconsidering the vector mixing angle \u03c6V different from zero, which translates into a finite\nslope for the (\u03c9, \u03c6) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 bands, in the result obtained. This contrasts with the analysis of\nRefs. [5, 6] where the vector mixing angle was not taken into account at that time because\ntheir effects were covered by the bigger experimental errors of the bands. With the present\navailable experimental data, fixing the value of this angle to zero would have lead to an\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\f40.3\u25e6 42.7\u25e6\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u2032 \u03b3\n\n0.6\n\nY\u03b7\u2032\n0.4\n\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3\n\n\u239e\n\n0.2 \u03c6\nP\n\n0\n0\n\n\u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nX\u03b7 \u2032\ncoefficients in\nFigure 2: Constraints on non-strange (X\u03b7\u2032 ) and strange (Y\u03b7\u2032 ) quarkonium mixing \u221a\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthe \u03b7 .

For completeness, the points corresponding\nto the \u03b7 being a pure octet (X\u03b7 = \u2212 \u221a12 Y\u03b7 = \u221a13 ) and the \"democratic\" mixing solution\n\n(X\u03b7 = Y\u03b7 = \u221a12 ) are also shown in Fig. 1 as an open and closed circle, respectively. The\nlatter solution, which is now excluded, was still acceptable in the analysis of Ref. [5], where\nthe upper bound |Z\u03b7 | . 0.4 was obtained from the processes (\u03c1, \u03c6) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3.\nIn Ref. [6], after correcting some inconsistent data, there was no region where all three\nconstraints, coming from the (\u03c9, \u03c6) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays, overlap.\nThe situation is not so constrained for the \u03b7 \u2032 as we proceed to discuss. In Fig. 2, we\nplot the regions for the X\u03b7\u2032 and Y\u03b7\u2032 parameters which are allowed by the experimental\ncouplings of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3 and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 transitions. The remaining parameters\nare taken from Eq. (4.4). Again, we also plot the constraint implied by X\u03b72\u2032 + Y\u03b72\u2032 \u2264 1\nand the favoured region for the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle in absence of gluonium. This time there\nexists an intersection region of the three bands inside and on the circumference. As most\nof this region is interior but close to the circular boundary it may well indicate a small but\nnon necessarily zero gluonic content of the \u03b7 \u2032 .

(4.4) -left plot - and Eq. (4.8) -right plot -, respectively, assuming the presence of\ngluonium. The different bands are the regions for \u03c6P and Z\u03b72\u2032 allowed by the experimental couplings\nof the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3 (dashed line), \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3 (dot-dashed line), \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 (dotted line), and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 (solid\nline) transitions in Table 1 -left plot - and Table 2 -right plot -, respectively.\n\n(or |Z\u03b7\u2032 | = 0.2 \u00b1 0.2) or using the angular description |\u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G | = (12 \u00b1 13)\u25e6 . The size of\nthe error is precisely what prevent us from drawing a definite conclusion concerning the\namount of gluonium in the \u03b7 \u2032 wave function. More refined experimental data, particularly\nfor the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 channel, will contribute decisively to clarify this issue (see below). Clearly,\nthe inclusion of this process is of major importance for the determination of the gluonic\nadmixture in the \u03b7 \u2032 , as observed for the first time in Ref. [5]. In this latter analysis,\nwhere \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 were used in addition to different values for \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3, the\nabsence of a significant constraint on Y\u03b7\u2032 was keenly felt. However, the mixing solution\nX\u03b7\u2032 = Y\u03b7\u2032 = \u221a12 -closed circle in Fig. 2- was still acceptable. It was not the case for the\n\u221a\nsolution identifying the \u03b7 \u2032 as a pure singlet, X\u03b7\u2032 = 2Y\u03b7\u2032 = \u221a13 , -open circle in Fig. 2-. In\nthe present analysis, the \"democratic\" mixing solution is excluded at the 1\u03c3 level whereas\nthe singlet solution is clearly excluded. In Ref. [6], where \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c9\u03b3 was also included in the\nanalysis, the maximum gluonic admixture in the \u03b7 \u2032 was obtained to be 26% for \u03b8P = \u221211\u25e6\nZ \u2032\n(or \u03c6P \u2243 44\u25e6 ). In our case, for Z\u03b72\u2032 = 0.04 \u00b1 0.09, one gets R = X \u2032 +Y\u03b7 \u2032 +Z \u2032 = (13 \u00b1 13)%\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\nfor \u03c6P = 41.4\u25e6 (or \u03b8P = \u221213.4\u25e6 ). The same analysis also anticipated that the existence of a\ngluonic content for the \u03b7 \u2032 would be excluded for large |\u03b8P | (or small \u03c6P ). Finally, the KLOE\nanalysis in Ref. [1] has found a solution allowing for gluonium with \u03c6P = (39.7 \u00b1 0.7)\u25e6 and\nZ\u03b72\u2032 = 0.14 \u00b1 0.04 -or |\u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G | = (22 \u00b1 3)\u25e6 -, in disagreement, particularly for the Z\u03b72\u2032 value,\nwith our results. A second analysis without the constraint from the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c1\u03b3 decay, which\nis the less precise, gives \u03c6P = (39.8 \u00b1 0.8)\u25e6 and Z\u03b72\u2032 = 0.13 \u00b1 0.04, thus not modifying\ntheir conclusions. To make this difference more graphical, we follow Ref. [1] and plot in\nFig. 3 -left plot- the constraints from \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 (\u03c1, \u03c9)\u03b3 and \u03c6 \u2192 (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 )\u03b3 in the (\u03c6P , Z\u03b72\u2032 )\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fplane together with the 68% CL allowed region for gluonium as obtained from Eq. (4.4).\nThe point corresponding to the preferred solution, (\u03c6P , Z\u03b72\u2032 ) = (41.4\u25e6 , 0.04), is also shown.\nThe allowed region is very constrained in the \u03c6P axis by the experimental value of the\ng\u03c6\u03b7\u03b3 coupling, whose vertical band denotes its non dependence on Z\u03b72\u2032 . The other three\nbands, all dependent on \u03c6P and Z\u03b72\u2032 , constrain the amount of gluonium down to a value\ncompatible with zero within 1\u03c3. As mentioned before, our result differs from the KLOE's\none, where (\u03c6P , Z\u03b72\u2032 ) = (39.7\u25e6 , 0.14) is the preferred solution and the allowed region for\ngluonium is far from the \u03c6P axis (see Fig. 5 in Ref. [1]). The value compatible with zero\nwe have obtained for the gluonic content of the \u03b7 \u2032 wave function is fully confirmed from a\ngraphical point of view as soon as one includes the latest measurements of the \u03c6 \u2192 (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 )\u03b3\ndecays from Refs. [1, 14]. As seen in Fig. 3 -right plot-, the allowed region for gluonium\ndecreases due to the smaller experimental error of the g\u03c6\u03b7\u2032 \u03b3 coupling (although the error\nof g\u03c6\u03b7\u03b3 increases a little) and its central point (the preferred solution) is now located at\n(\u03c6P , Z\u03b72\u2032 ) = (42.6\u25e6 , 0.01), even much closer to the \u03c6P axis than before.\nIn all the other approaches discussed so far, the decays (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 ) \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 were also included\nin the analyses. As shortly stated in Sec. 1, in our approach we do not take into account\nthese processes since they are well explained using a two mixing angle scenario [7, 8].\nNevertheless, our framework can be extended to describe P 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decays in a similar way\nto V \u2192 P \u03b3 and P \u2192 V \u03b3. In such case, the needed ratios of decay widths are found to be\n\u0393(\u03b7\u2192\u03b3\u03b3)\n\u0393(\u03c0 0 \u2192\u03b3\u03b3)\n\u0393(\u03b7\u2032 \u2192\u03b3\u03b3)\n\u0393(\u03c0 0 \u2192\u03b3\u03b3)\n\n\u00112\n\u00113 \u0010\n\u221a\n,\n5 z\u0303q X\u03b7 + 2 mm\u0304s z\u0303s Y\u03b7\n\u00112\n\u0010 m \u00113 \u0010\n\u221a\n\u2032\n= 19 m \u03b70\n,\n5 z\u0303q X\u03b7\u2032 + 2 mm\u0304s z\u0303s Y\u03b7\u2032\n=\n\n1\n9\n\n\u0010\n\nm\u03b7\nm\u03c00\n\n(5.1)\n\n\u03c0\n\nwhere, in addition to the parameter m\u0304/ms related to the different quark spin-flip effects\nof the emission of one photon, we have to introduce two new SU (3) breaking parameters,\nz\u0303q \u2261 C\u0303q /C\u0303\u03c0 and z\u0303s \u2261 C\u0303s /C\u0303\u03c0 , dealing with the spatial wave functions effects of quarkantiquark annihilation into the other photon. These new parameters are analogous to\nthe overlapping parameters, zq and zs , of the V P \u03b3 transitions, and for the same reason,\nthe U (1)A anomaly, we also distinguish between the quark-antiquark annihilation effects\nin |\u03c0i and |\u03b7q i. For comparison, in Ref. [5] the former SU (3) breaking effects are not\nconsidered, i.e. z\u0303q = z\u0303s = 1 and m\u0304/ms = 1, while in Ref. [6], where the P 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\nf\ndecays are characterized by means of pseudoscalar decay constants, one identifies f\u03c0q = z\u0303q\u22121\nand ff\u03c0s = mm\u0304s z\u0303s\u22121 . As seen in Eq. (5.1), these ratios are not useful for fixing, within\nour approach, the mixing parameters of the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 system since they also depend on the\nunknown values of z\u0303q and z\u0303s . However, in order to check the consistency of this extended\nframework, one could use for the mixing parameters and m\u0304/ms the results obtained from\nthe analysis of V \u2192 P \u03b3 and P \u2192 V \u03b3 decays and then fix the values of z\u0303q,s from the two\nratios under consideration. In this case, one gets z\u0303q = 0.96 \u00b1 0.03 and z\u0303s = 0.79 \u00b1 0.13\nand hence fq = (1.05 \u00b1 0.03)f\u03c0 and fs = (1.57 \u00b1 0.28)f\u03c0 , in agreement with the values\nfq = (1.10\u00b10.03)f\u03c0 and fs = (1.66\u00b10.07)f\u03c0 found in Ref. [7], thus showing the consistency\nof the mixing parameters obtained and of the whole approach.\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f6. Summary and conclusions\nIn this work we have performed a phenomenological analysis of radiative V \u2192 P \u03b3 and\nP \u2192 V \u03b3 decays with the purpose of determining the gluon content of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons.\nThe present approach is based on a conventional SU (3) quark model supplemented with two\nsources of SU (3) breaking, the use of constituent quark masses with ms > m\u0304, thus making\nthe V P \u03b3 magnetic dipole transitions to distinguish between photon emission from strange\nor non-strange quarks, and the different spatial extensions for each P or V isomultiplet\nwhich induce different overlaps between the P and V wave functions. The use of these\ndifferent overlapping parameters -a specific feature of our analysis- is shown to be of\nprimary importance in order to reach a good agreement.\nOur conclusions are the following. First, the current experimental data on V P \u03b3 transitions indicate within our model a negligible gluonic content for the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons,\nZ\u03b72 = 0.00 \u00b1 0.12 and Z\u03b72\u2032 = 0.04 \u00b1 0.09. Second, accepting the absence of gluonium for\nthe \u03b7 meson, the gluonic content of the \u03b7 \u2032 wave function amounts to |\u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G | = (12 \u00b1 13)\u25e6\nand the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle is found to be \u03c6P = (41.4 \u00b1 1.3)\u25e6 . Third, imposing the absence\nof gluonium for both mesons one finds \u03c6P = (41.5 \u00b1 1.2)\u25e6 , in agreement with the former\nresult. Fourth, the latest experimental data on (\u03c1, \u03c9, \u03c6) \u2192 \u03b7\u03b3 and \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 decays confirm\nthe null gluonic content of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 wave functions. Finally, we would like to stress\nthat more refined experimental data, particularly for the \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b7 \u2032 \u03b3 channel, will contribute\ndecisively to clarify this issue.\n\nAcknowledgements\nR.E. thanks A.

Euler angles\nIn presence of gluonium, the wave functions of the \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 mesons and the glueball-like\nstate \u03b9 can be decomposed as\n|\u03b7i = X\u03b7 |\u03b7q i + Y\u03b7 |\u03b7s i + Z\u03b7 |Gi ,\n|\u03b7 \u2032 i = X\u03b7\u2032 |\u03b7q i + Y\u03b7\u2032 |\u03b7s i + Z\u03b7\u2032 |Gi ,\n\n(A.1)\n\n|\u03b9i = X\u03b9 |\u03b7q i + Y\u03b9 |\u03b7s i + Z\u03b9 |Gi ,\n \u0304 |\u03b7s i = |ss\u0304i and |Gi \u2261 |gluoniumi. The \u03b9 or \u03b7(1440) state,\nwhere |\u03b7q i \u2261 \u221a12 |u\u016b + ddi,\nwhich we refrain from discussing here, could be identified with the \u03b7(1405) pseudoscalar\nresonance (see Ref. [4] for details). The nine coefficients in Eq. (A.1) are constrained by\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fthree normalization conditions\nX\u03b72 + Y\u03b72 + Z\u03b72 = 1 ,\nX\u03b72\u2032 + Y\u03b72\u2032 + Z\u03b72\u2032 = 1 ,\n\n(A.2)\n\nX\u03b92 + Y\u03b92 + Z\u03b92 = 1 ,\nand three orthogonality conditions\nX\u03b7 X\u03b7\u2032 + Y\u03b7 Y\u03b7\u2032 + Z\u03b7 Z\u03b7\u2032 = 0 ,\n(A.3)\n\nX\u03b7 X\u03b9 + Y\u03b7 Y\u03b9 + Z\u03b7 Z\u03b9 = 0 ,\nX\u03b7\u2032 X\u03b9 + Y\u03b7\u2032 Y\u03b9 + Z\u03b7\u2032 Z\u03b9 = 0 .\n\nAltogether implies that only three independent parameters are required to describe the\nrotation between the physical states (\u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b9) and the orthonormal mathematical states\n(\u03b7q , \u03b7s and G). The rotation matrix can be written in terms of three mixing angles, \u03c6P ,\n\u03c6\u03b7G and \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G , which would correspond to the three Euler angles for a rotation in real,\nthree-dimensional space.

In the limit in which \u03c6\u03b7G = \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G = 0, the gluonium decouples and\nthe former matrix reduces to the usual rotation matrix describing \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing,\n!\n!\n!\n\u03b7\n\u03b7q\ncos \u03c6P \u2212 sin \u03c6P\n,\n(A.5)\n=\n\u03b7s\n\u03b7\u2032\nsin \u03c6P cos \u03c6P\nwhere \u03c6P is the \u03b7-\u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle in the quark-flavour basis related to its octet-singlet basis\n\u221a\nanalog through \u03b8P = \u03c6P \u2212 arctan 2 \u2243 \u03c6P \u2212 54.7\u25e6 . An interesting situation occurs when\nthe gluonium content of the \u03b7 meson is assumed to vanish, i.e. \u03c6\u03b7G = 0. In this particular\ncase,\nX\u03b7 = cos \u03c6P ,\nY\u03b7 = \u2212 sin \u03c6P ,\nZ\u03b7 = 0 ,\n(A.6)\nX\u03b7\u2032 = sin \u03c6P cos \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G , Y\u03b7\u2032 = cos \u03c6P cos \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G , Z\u03b7\u2032 = \u2212 sin \u03c6\u03b7\u2032 G .\n\nReferences\n[1] F.
