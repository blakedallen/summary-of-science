Sych et al.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe detection and the classification of various solar features is a complex task\nthat relies on the expertise of observers, modelers, and theorists. The identification of highly energetic features, such as flares and CMEs, is often straightforward, and their signatures are well known and usually uniformly accepted in the\nsolar physics community. Also, large-scale features, such as coronal holes, active\nregions, and loops can be identified with standard image processing algorithms\n(e.g. Aschwanden et al., 2008; Scholl and Habbal, 2008; Krista and Gallagher,\n2009). The main difficulty lies in the identification of \"weak\" features, which are\nclose to the instrumental resolution or signal-to-noise threshold. However, these\nfeatures, such as waves, often can provide us with invaluable information on the\nphysical conditions in the solar atmosphere (e.g. see the review by Nakariakov\nand Verwichte, 2005).\nThe study of coronal waves and oscillations is one of the most rapidly developing areas of solar physics and lies in the mainstream of the scientific exploitation\nof solar mission data. Coronal-wave processes attract our attention because of\ntheir possible role in the enigmatic problems of coronal physics: coronal heating,\ntriggering of flares and CMEs, and the acceleration of the solar wind. Also, as\nproperties of waves contain information about the medium of their propagation,\nthe waves are natural probes of the medium, providing us with a tool for its\ndiagnostics. The analysis of coronal data in order to determine parameters of\nwaves and oscillations is a non-trivial task, mainly because of the detection of\nthese phenomena near the very threshold of the instrumental detectability, and\nthe necessity to analyse the spatial, temporal, and phase variations simultaneously at the highest-possible resolution. The problem has been amplified by the\nlack of an instrument dedicated to coronal-wave studies. The Solar Dynamics\nObservatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) is the first instrument\nto have coronal seismology as one of its scientific themes. AIA will provide us\nwith greatly enhanced cadence and signal-to-noise ratio in comparison with\nthe previous generation of solar-coronal imagers. In the past, the detection\nof waves in the solar corona relied heavily on individual examination of time\nsequences of images (\"movies\") by experts in the field. The availability of AIA\nwill substantially increase the data rates, requiring the development of novel data\nanalysis methods for the automated detection of coronal wave and oscillatory\nprocesses. The pioneering studies of this problem (De Moortel and McAteer,\n2004; Nakariakov and King, 2007; Marsh et al., 2008; McIntosh et al., 2008) have\naddressed this issue, investigating automated-detection techniques of coronal\nwaves, based upon the wavelet and Fourier transforms, Bayesian statistics and\ncoherence/travel time based approach.\nThere are several classes of MHD waves in the solar corona, which are to\nbe recognized by an automated detection system. The observational evidence of\nthe presence of MHD waves and oscillations is abundant (see e.g. Nakariakov\nand Verwichte, 2005). Observed properties of these waves are determined by\nthe original MHD mode (slow or fast magnetoacoustic, Alfv\u00e9n) and the guiding\nplasma structure. Different MHD modes of plasma structures have very different\nphysical properties (e.g. compressibility, polarization, dispersion, cut-offs, etc.)\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 2\n\n\fWeb-Based Data Processing System\n\nand hence have different observational manifestations. SDO/AIA will be able to\nsee at least two of them, the transverse (kink) and the longitudinal modes at\nhigher spatial and temporal resolution than previously.\nIn this paper we describe a web-based system for the remote processing of\nimaging datasets (such as SOHO/EIT, TRACE, STEREO/EUVI, Nobeyama\nRadioheliograph, Hinode/XRT, CORONAS-PHOTON/TESIS, and SDO/AIA,\ndesigned for the automated detection of periodic and quasi-periodic processes.\nThe system has a modular structure that allows for the easy update and inclusion\nof new data analysis and visualization tools. The present version of the system\nimplements the techniques of periodmapping (Nakariakov and King, 2007) and\nthe Pixelised Wavelet Filtering (PWF: Sych and Nakariakov, 2008). Also, there\nis a possibility of using the standard Morlet wavelet and periodogram analysis\nof 1D signals.\nThe method of peridomapping provides fast preliminary analysis of imaging\ndatacubes, allowing for the identification of the candidate regions and time\nintervals for the presence of spatially resolved oscillatory phenomena. With this\nmethod, the time is divided into 30 minutes (or, optionally, of other duration)\ntime slots which overlap by a half of the duration. Periodograms of the time\nsignal of each pixel (or optionally a macropixel, consisting of several adjacent\npixels for improved signal-to-noise ratio) are constructed. Options include signal smoothing, user-defined filtering, and construction of the running-difference\nsignal. Then, the frequency of the highest spectral power is identified and tested\nagainst a certain criterion. The default is that if the highest spectral power is\nhigher than five times the mean level of the spectral power, then the signal is\ntreated as an \"oscillatory\" and the frequency of the highest spectral power is\ndetermined. Then, the pixel is assigned a certain colour according to a chosen\ncolour coding scheme, in which different colours correspond to different spectral\nfrequencies. If the highest spectral power is lower than the detection threshold,\nthe signal is treated as \"non-oscillatory\" and the pixel is left blank. Hence, a\nstatic 2D map of the analysed field of view (a \"periodmap\") for the analysed time\ninterval is created. The blobs of the same or similar colour (corresponding to the\nsame or similar time frequency of the oscillation) indicate the presence of the\noscillation. Then the process is repeated for the next time interval. As a result,\na time sequence of periodmaps is obtained, which can be very easily analysed\nby visual inspection, or automatically, identifying the \"oscillatory regions\" in\ncertain time intervals.\nThe PWF method (Sych and Nakariakov, 2008) is a generalisation of the\nwavelet transform of 3D datacubes. Temporal signal of each spatial pixel is\nwavelet transformed (e.g. with a Morlet mother function), which results in the\npower, amplitude, and phase 4D data cubes (two spatial dimensions, time, and\nthe frequency). The 4D data cubes can be processed according to a specific\nrequest. For example, selecting a certain spectral component or integrating over\na certain narrow spectral range makes a 3D narrowband datacube that consists\nof a sequence of narrowband maps. The temporal evolution of the sources of the\nnarrowband oscillations can be visualised by a movie (e.g. in the MPEG format).\nSimilarly, one can create a movie of the global wavelet spectrum evolution.\nSelecting a certain 1D slit on the map makes it possible to make narrowband\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 3\n\n\fR.A. Sych et al.\n\nor broadband time\u2013distance plots. In particular, this allows one to identify the\nobserved mode, to discriminate between standing and propagating modes, determine the morphology of wave sources and study its time evolution, and detect\nmultiple periodicities and their interrelation. This knowledge is crucial for MHD\ncoronal seismology and the study of the solar atmospheric connectivity. In the\nfuture, we plan to include other data processing tools, such as the Gradient\nPattern Analysis (GPA-method: Rosa et al., 2000).\nThe main aim of the present system is the remote processing of data cubes\nsupplied by the user. The user does not need to have deep knowledge of data\nprocessing techniques, and programming. Also, it is not necessary to have the\nInteractive Data Language (IDL) installed on the user's computer. The minimal\nprerequisites are access to the Internet and a standard web browser. The input\nparameters are the imaging data cubes. The output parameters are the global\nand local (e.g. for a selected pixel or macropixel, or a slit) spectra, narrowband images, periodmaps, wave vector maps, and movies showing the temporal\nevolution of the maps.\nApplication of the system to the detection of coronal waves and oscillations is\nillustrated with the use of the microwave and EUV imaging data cubes of NOAA\n10756 obtained with TRACE and the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH). During the passage of this active region across the solar disk on 1 \u2013 5 May 2005 both\nstanding and propagating waves have been detected (see Sych et al., 2009 for\ndetails), which made it a good test case for the present study.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In the next section we describe some existing examples of on-line data access and analysis tools. Section 3 describes the\nscientific objectives of the system. Section 4 discusses the system architecture\nand gives an example of the user interface. Sections 5 and 6 illustrate the application of the system to the analysis of observational data from the spatial\nand temporal points of view, respectively. The conclusions and discussion of the\nresults obtained are given in Section 7.\n\n2. Existing On-Line Resources\nIn the design of the present system, existing on-line systems for information\nprocessing were used. At the moment, on the Internet, there are a number of\nsites for the remote processing of documents, multi-lingual translators, search\nengines, on-line game resources etc. Examples of such sites are the following.\nhttp://www.aie.sp.ru/Calculator filter.html - automatic calculation of the filtering elements for radio-engineering systems. The output is the amplitude and\nphase spectral properties of the designed system, and the integral properties of\nthe circuit.\nhttp://ion.researchsystems.com/IONScript/wavelet - on-line interactive continuous wavelet transform for time-series analysis.\nhttp://translate.google.com/translate - multi-lingual translation of web resources\nhttp://docs.google.com - Create and share work online, edit document any\ntime, from anywhere. Share changes in real time. Files are stored securely online.\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 4\n\n\fWeb-Based Data Processing System\n\nIn the solar research community, examples of such resources are the Virtual Solar Observatory [http://umbra.nscom.nasa.gov/vso/] that provides one\nwith the access to the data of different solar observational facilities; Space\nWeather Monitoring [http://sidc.oma.be/html/LatestSWData.html] that provides\nreal-time information on the solar, heliospheric and magnetospheric activity and\nSolar Monitor [http://solarmonitor.org/index.php] - that provides the monitoring\nof active regions in the solar atmosphere. These resources aim at the data warehousing and data search and access optimisation, and usually do not process the\ndata. Thus, our system is different from the existing on-line tools.\n\n3. The Proposed Scheme of Automated Detection of Oscillatory\nFeatures in Datacubes\nThe combination of the periodmapping and PWF techniques suggests the following method for the automated detection of coronal waves and oscillations in\nimaging data cubes:\ni) Full-disk data cubes of 30 and 60-minute duration, overlapping in the middle of the sampling time interval, will be processed with the Periodmapping\ntechnique. The outcome is a sequence of static full-disk images which highlight the presence of spatial regions and time intervals identified for detailed\nstudy, aiming at detection of transverse and longitudinal oscillations and\nwaves. The periodmaps are then stored for further analysis. The selection\nof the regions of interest (ROI) on the map will be performed manually\nor with the implementation of an automated pattern-recognition method.\nThe comparison of possible techniques can be found in Aschwanden et al.\n(2008).\nii) The specific pattern-recognition technique built in the system is based\nupon the application of the harmonicity criterion. For this we define minimum \u01ebmin, maximum \u01ebmax and average \u01ebave values of the peaks in Fourier\npower spectra of each pixel and then calculate the harmonicity degree\nH \u2261 (\u01ebmax \u2212 \u01ebave )/(\u01ebave \u2212 \u01ebmin). The spatial distribution of these values\nforms a harmonicity degree map of the datacube, highlighting the regions of\nhigh harmonicity. Then, we determine spatial regions where the harmonicity\ndegree is higher than a certain threshold value. Regions smaller than some\nprescribed value can be disregarded. Then we may inscribe the regions of\nthe enhanced harmonicity into circles or rectangles to get an ROI of a simple\nshape. From the Fourier transform of the signal of each pixel of the ROI we\ncalculate the phase \u0398 \u2261 I(ln(z)), where z is the complex amplitude of the\nhighest amplitude spectral component. Also, it is possible to calculate the\nphase differences between the neighbouring pixels in a certain prescribed\ndirection (e.g. horizontal or vertical), constructing phase-difference maps.\nOn such a map, a standing-wave pattern corresponds to the phase vector\nof zero magnitude, in contrast to propagating waves which have nonzero\nvalues of the projected wave vectors.

The System Architecture and User Interface\nThe key principles of the system architecture are that all calculations should be\ncarried out directly on the server remotely from the user through the Internet; the\nsoftware and hardware prerequisites for the user's computer should be minimal;\nthe user should be able to upload and download data; the calculations on the\nserver are carried out with the use of the Interactive Data Language (IDL).\nHence it was decided to design the system as a web application, with the use of\na standard Internet browser as the user's client. From the user's point of view,\nthe system looks like an Internet site. The system is controlled (including data\nuploading and downloading) from the web page.\nThe presented system is made more user-friendly by reducing the effect of\nsome known mistakes connected with poor preparation of the input data or\nwith the lack of user experience, which may lead to the generation of artifacts\nin the output. In particular, the number of possible mother wavelet functions\nis limited; an optimal number of wave numbers is set up; the variation of the\nfrequency resolution is restricted. In any case, the final interpretation of the\nresults obtained with the use of the system is entirely up to the user.\nThe key elements of the system are:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nInternet browser for the user interface;\nWeb server receiving the user's queries and transferring the input and\noutput data;\nServer scripts responsible for the interaction between the web-server and\nthe IDL codes which carry out the calculations;\nThe codes that implement the data analysis and output generation techniques.\n\nTaking into account these architecture principles, we created a web-site [http://pwf.iszf.irk.ru]\nthat provides access to the remote data analysis server (Figure 2). The specific\nimplementation includes the following components:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nWeb-server Apache;\nThe web site is controlled with the CMS Joomla software with an integrated\ncomponent written in PHP, which carries out the interface with the IDL\nprogrammes;\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 7\n\n\fR.A.

Bottom\npanel: The window of harmonic PWF data processing.\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 8\n\n\fWeb-Based Data Processing System\n\n\u2022\n\nIDL is used for that data processing, analysis and creation of the graphical\nand video files.\nStep-by-step work of the system is as follows:\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nOn the user's command, a temporary file folder for the storage of files\n(images and videos, temporary files, postscripts) of the current session is\nautomatically created by a PHP script and assigned with a unique name;\nthe data are uploaded to the folder;\nSimultaneously, a new server session is started. The session data are stored\nin a MySQL database. Session identification cookies are sent to the user's\nbrowser;\nAfter that, the PHP script opens the IDL interpreter and runs the required\nIDL programmes, supplying them with the parameters according to the\nuser's queries;\nThe IDL programme reads the uploaded data, processes them, saves them\nin a file, and passes the control to the PHP script;\nPHP script reads the output data from the hard drive and send it to the\nuser's browser;\nAt the end of the session, the outcome data are sent to the user, the\ntemporary folder is stored for three days and then deleted.\n\nThe session-based approach allows for simultaneous work by several users. Input,\noutput, and temporary files of different users are stored in different folders.\nEach data-analysis technique (wavelet, periodmapping, PWF) has a specific\npage on the web-site, which contains its description, user's manuals, references\nto the journal papers, and the description of the data analysis server interface.\nThe interface allows the user to upload the data, and run the data analysis\nprocedures.\nThe system performance was tested by processing time sequences of 512\u00d7512\npixel images on a standard PC (Intel Core Quad Q9400 2.66 GHz, 4Gb RAM).\nThe temporal window was 100 time steps, and the analysis was carried out\nfor each ten time steps. The total speed of the processing, including the system\ninitialization time and the file exchanges, was found to be 100 frames per minute,\nor 16 Mbit s\u22121 . The use of GPU tools will increase the total processing speed\nby 10\u201320 times. Thus, even a standard PC can be used for the high spatial and\ntemporal resolution data processing.\nConsider the work of the system using the PWF method as an example. To\nstart, the user selects the item Data Processing in the Main menu (Figure 2),\nwhich opens the Data Processing screen. In the upper part of the screen, there\nis a control panel that contains tabs of different functions. In the main part of\nthe screen the current data processing results are shown. The work begins with\nthe use of the Data Parameters tab that allows the user to specify the temporal\nand spatial resolution of the input data cube, the units, and the format of the\nuploaded data. At the moment, the system supports three input data formats:\nASCII, FITS, and SAVE (the internal IDL format). Also, here the user sees the\nform for the data uploading. Once the data are uploaded, the main screen shows\nthe first image of the data cube, its variation map, the time dependence of the\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 9\n\n\fR.A. Sych et al.\n\nintegrated flux (the \"light curve\") and the amplitude global wavelet spectrum.\nThe spectrum is constructed by the summation of the spectra of individual\npixels. Such a spectrum can be quite different from the spectrum calculated for\nthe integrated light curve that is obtained by the summation of time signals of\nthe individual pixels. The reason for the discrepancy is that in the latter case\nthe spectrum can be affected by the phase differences between the signals of\ndifferent pixels, cancelling the signals.\nThe next tab, Automatic analysis, contains the buttons for the run of two\ndifferent algorithms of the PWF analysis, multi-component and harmonic. The\nmulti-component PWF analysis is based upon the expansion of the temporal\nsignal of each pixel by the octaves of the wavelet spectrum with the frequencies\nthat are multiples of two. The number and the spectral width of the channels are\ndetermined by the cadence and the duration of the signal. For each frequency\nband, the spectral power of the signal is calculated. Repeating this for each pixel,\nwe can synthesise a broadband oscillation map of the data cube. This approach\nallows for the rapid determination of the spatial-frequency distribution of the\nharmonic oscillation power in the signal, and its spatial localization. The second\nalgorithm, the harmonic PWF, is based upon the construction of narrowband\nimages of the oscillatory sources that correspond to certain selected harmonics\n(e.g. corresponding to significant peaks in the global wavelet spectrum). In\ncomparison with Fourier spectrum, the global wavelet spectra are known to\nbe smoother in the high-frequency part of the spectrum, and better resolution\nin the lower-frequency part. Hence, the determination of the significant spectral peaks (e.g. over the 90% significance calculated according to Torrence and\nCompo, 1998), the use of global wavelet spectra reduces the level of the spurious\ninformation that is not connected with the significant harmonics.\nThe flexibility allowed in the choice of the wavelet analysis parameters is\nbased upon the minimisation of their effect, allowing effective data processing\nby an inexperienced user. In the present version of the system, the user can\nchoose the band of analysed frequencies and frequency resolution and select\ncertain harmonics of interest. The noise can be removed in two ways: running\naveraging and median averaging in both spatial and temporal domains. Images\nwith a prescribed level of significance are obtained by the adjustment of the\nsignificance levels of each pixel to the prescribed value. In the images the pixels\nwhere the cutoff frequency, determined by the cone of influence, is exceeded are\nhighlighted e.g. by framing.\nDetailed analysis of the input data can be carried out in the manual regime,\nwhich can be reached by the Wavelet Subband Filtration tab. Here the user can\nprescribe the band of the periods of interest, as well as the temporal interval\nof interest. This approach allows the user to study the amplitude and period\nmodulation of coronal waves and oscillations, minimizing the effect of neighbouring frequencies, giving the time evolution of the user-selected narrowband\namplitude, power and phase maps in the form of MPEG-movies.\nA periodmap of the analysed data cube is constructed in the Periodmap\ntab, which allows the user to specify the upper and lower cut-off frequencies.\nGeneral settings of the data analysis (e.g. the filtering methods and thresholds,\nthe possibility of subtracting the running mean) and of the visualization (the\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 10\n\n\fWeb-Based Data Processing System\n\ncolour table, the format of the output file, e.g. PostScript) can be modified on\nthe Settings tab.\n\n5. Test Data (Spatial Approach)\nThe system has been tested by the analysis of the data obtained with TRACE\nin the 171\u00c5 bandpass with the temporal resolution of eight seconds, and spatial\nresolution 1\u2032\u2032 . The test data sequence contained the active region NOAA 10756\nobserved from 1 to 4 May 2005 during its passage across the solar disk. The\ndetailed analysis of this AR is presented in Sych et al. (2009). During the observation interval, the AR showed high radio-burst activity, observed by NoRH\nin 17 GHz. A number of radio bursts with duration from 10 seconds to 30\nminutes were detected. Also, stationary oscillations of the integrated radio flux\nwith the period about three minutes were detected. The three-minute oscillations\nwere found to be caused by the variations of the radio brightness of the sunspot\nassociated with the AR. The analysis revealed a relationship between the sunspot\noscillations and flaring energy releases, in particular, radio bursts, in this AR\nand nearby. Radio bursts were found to be preceeded by the increase of the\npower of the three-minute oscillations. A significant spectral peak was typically\nappearing about 10 \u2013 12 minutes before the burst. The PWF analysis of the 17\nGHz NoRH datacube revealed that the increase in the three-minute oscillation\npower was accompanied by the appearance of a characteristic V-shaped structure\non the three-minute narrowband maps. The fingers of the structure were directed\ntowards the burst location. The V-shaped structures were found to coincide\nwith the low-lying magnetic loops linking the regions of the opposite magnetic\npolarity. This finding suggests that the flaring energy releases could be associated\nwith longitudinal waves leaking from the sunspot along the magnetic flux tubes\ntowards the flaring site. Also, the presence of a significant three-minute spectral\ncomponent in the flaring light curves indicates that the three-minute longitudinal\nwaves can modulate the emission.\nHere we continue the study begun in Sych et al. (2009), concentrating on the\nthree-minute waves in quiet-Sun conditions. Initially, the TRACE 171\u00c5 datacube\nwas preprocessed with the use of the trace prep subroutine (signal calibration,\ndark current/pedestal removal, CCD gain and lumogen correction, etc.). Also,\nthe data were derotated. Then, the datacube was analysed with the use of the\nsystem described.\n5.1. Periodmap Analysis of the Active Region NOAA 10756\nThe preliminary analysis was carried out by the Periodmap technique. Figure 3\nshows the images of AR NOAA 10756 on 4 May 2005 taken at 03:02 UT in white\nlight and in the EUV. It is evident that in the corona the sunspot coincides\nwith a system of bright loops originating from its umbra. The periodmap of\nthe TRACE 171\u00c5 datacube at 03:30 \u2013 03:50 UT indicates the presence of threeminute oscillations situated over the sunspot, in the region highlighted by the\nsquare. In the same region, the visual inspection of the datacube movie reveals\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 11\n\n\fR.A.

The horizontal bars represent the\nperiod scale in minutes.\n\nthe presence of longitudinal waves propagating outwards from the sunspot along\nthe loops. Outside the sunspot, there are small regions of significant oscillations,\nwhich correspond to the footpoints of the loops in the active region.\nThe size of the spatial localisation of the oscillating regions (\"wave traces\")\nis found to be about 20 \u2013 30\u2032\u2032 , which coincided with the results obtained by\nother authors (Berghmans and Clette, 1999; De Moortel et al., 2000, 2002a,b;\nRobbrecht et al., 2001; King et al., 2003; De Moortel, 2006). Also, in agreement\nwith previous studies of this phenomenon, the wave traces are situated at the\nfootpoint of the magnetic fan structure. Some non-uniformity in the spatial distribution of the dominating periods is revealed as well: shorter period oscillations\n(two \u2013 three minutes) are apparently situated closer to the footpoint.\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 12\n\n\fWeb-Based Data Processing System\n\n5.2. PWF Analysis of the Active Region NOAA 10756\nThe light curve of the total flux in the interval 03:30 \u2013 03:50 UT and its global\nwavelet spectrum (Figure 4) demonstrate the presence of three- and ten-minute\noscillatory patterns. More detailed information is obtained with the use of the\nPWF technique. The narrowband maps made with PWF in the six (multiple of\ntwo, from 16 seconds to 1024 seconds) period bands, are shown in Figure 4.\nThe global normalisation of the image by the level of the signals in the whole\nspectral band was implemented here. (The user can choose between the normalisation by global and local extrema). The contours show the levels of the\nnarrowband power in percents from the global spectral power maximum.\nIn the short period band (16 \u2013 32 seconds) there is no clear localisation of\nthe perturbations, which occupy the whole magnetic fan and perhaps are noise.\nPerturbations with longer periods are seen to be localised in certain parts of\nthe magnetic fan. The most pronounced structuring is found for the spectral\ncomponents in the range 128 \u2013 256 seconds, which coincides with the result\nof periodmapping. However, the narrowband maps obtained with PWF are\nmuch sharper and cleaner. In particular, the narrowband maps show evidence\nof splitting of the three-minute wave traces. Also, the wave traces are stretched\nalong the probable direction of the magnetic flux tubes. Perturbations with the\nperiods longer than 512 seconds that have relatively low power, demonstrate\nsome spatial structuring too. Similar features have already been discussed in\nSych and Nakariakov (2008) and were shown to be standing waves.\n5.3. Comparison of Wave Traces at Different Layers of the Solar Atmosphere\nAdditional information about the waveguiding channels can be obtained with the\nsimultaneous use of EUV and the microwaves, e.g. the gyroresonant emission\nat the transition-region level observed with NoRH at 17 GHz. A sequence of\nmicrowave polarisation (R\u2013L) images of AR 10756 on 4 May 2005, 02:30 \u2013 05:00\nUT was synthesized with the temporal resolution ten seconds. At 17 GHz NoRH\nhas the spatial resolution of 10\u2032\u2032 . After standard preprocessing, the data cube\nwas analysed with the use of PWF. These results are compared with the results\nof the PWF analysis of the TRACE EUV 171\u00c5 data.\nFigure 5 shows narrowband maps of three-minute waves obtained in the microwave and EUV bands, in panels (a) and (b) respectively. The black contours\ngive the spatial distribution of the unfiltered microwave and EUV emission. The\nmicrowave polarisation source has a symmetric shape and coincides with the\nsunspot umbra, while the EUV emission sources are highly extended, highlighting coronal loops. The narrowband map of the three-minute variations of the\nmicrowave emission shows that there are two waves patterns of the size about\n20 \u2013 30\u2032\u2032 . One located at (620, -75) in the umbra is V-shaped. The other one\nat (620, -55), situated at the umbra\u2013penumbra boundary, has a round shape.\nThe extended V-shaped wave traces indicate the presence of certain waveguides,\nwhich are very likely to be magnetic flux tubes (Van Doorsselaere et al., 2008; see\nalso discussion in Sych et al., 2009). Magnetic structuring above the sunspot determines the detected structuring of the wave traces. Thus, the narrowband-wave\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 13\n\n\fR.A.

Accounting for the difference in the spatial resolution\nof TRACE and NoRH, we conclude that three-minute wave traces of the EUV\nand microwave emission variations practically coincide. Thus, it is very likely\nthat the variations are caused by the same wave process.\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 14\n\n\fWeb-Based Data Processing System\n04-May-2005, TRACE 171A, 03:30-03:50 UT\n\n04-May-2005, NoRH 17GHz, 03:50-04:20 UT\n\n(b)\n-20\n\n-40\n\n-40\n\nY, [arc sec]\n\nY, [arc sec]\n\n(a)\n-20\n\n-60\n\n-60\n\n-80\n\n-80\n\n-100\n\n-100\n\n-120\n\n600\n\n620\n\n660\n\n640\n\n680\n\n700\n\n-120\n\n600\n\n04-May-2005, MDI Magnetogram, 00:00 UT\n\n(c)\n\n620\n\n640\n\n660\n\n680\n\n700\n\nX, [arc sec]\n\nX, [arc sec]\n\n04-May-2005, TRACE 171A, 00:04 UT\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 5.

Sych et al.\n\n6. Test Data (Temporal Approach)\nIn the previous section we considered the spatial distribution of the narrowband variations that corresponded to a certain band of periods during a certain\nprescribed temporal interval. The temporal information about the evolution of\nthe spectrum, which is also present in the 4D cube of the PWF analysis, is\nmissing. However, this information can provide us with valuable knowledge of\nthe amplitude, power, and phase dynamics of the oscillations. This is especially\nrelevant to the corona, where the oscillations are usually rather non-stationary.\n6.1. Dynamics of the Three-Minute Radio Sources at the Transition Zone\nThe dynamics of three-minute waves in the transition region is studied in a\nsequence of narrowband maps constructed by the described system with the use\nof the harmonic PWF technique. The input datacube was formed by 17 GHz\npolarisation images obtained with NoRH on 04 May 2005 at 02:30 \u2013 05:00 UT.\nThe input for the creation of narrowband maps was a 30-minute time interval.\nSliding the temporal interval by steps of ten minutes, we obtained twelve narrowband maps of the three-minute wave patterns, shown in Figure 6. All maps\nare normalised. The dashed curve shows the sunspot-umbra boundary. The wave\ntraces are numbered.\nAt the beginning of the observation (02:30 \u2013 03:20 UT) there are three wave\ntraces. Traces 1 and 4 are situated at the umbra\u2013penumbra boundary, while trace\n3 is in the umbra. During the initial stage of the observations, the shape remains\nalmost constant. Later, since 03:00 \u2013 03:30 UT traces 3 and 4 are changed, a new\ntrace appears and a V-shaped structure is formed. Simultaneously, the strength\nof source 1 is growing. The maximum modification of the morphology is at\n03:30 \u2013 04:00 UT. Later on, the V-shaped structure disappears, and the initial\nconfiguration is restored.\nThe obtained changes in the morphology of the three-minute wave traces\ncan be interpreted as the non-stationarity of the wave leakage from the subphotospheric regions to the transition region. The wave traces are found to\nhave round and extended shapes. This indicates the change of the wave vector\ncomponent in the plane perpendicular to the LOS. In the initial stage of the\nobservation, the wave traces had a round shape, indicating that the waves were\npropagating mainly along the LOS or were standing in the LOS direction. As\nthe LOS was almost perpendicular to the solar surface in the vicinity of the\nsunspot, this corresponded to the vertical motions of plasma. Thus, the temporal\nevolution of the wave traces may indicate the change of the wave propagation\ndirection.\nWe would like to point out that such an orientation of the fingers of the\nV-shaped structures in the three-minute narrowband maps of the microwave\nemission remained the same throughout the passage of NOAA 10756 over the\nsolar disk. This indicates a continuous leakage of waves, which lasts for several\ndays. However, during energy releases, there can be relatively short temporal\nintervals (10 \u2013 30 minutes) when the orientation of the wave traces changes to\nthe different from that of the quiet Sun (Sych et al., 2009).

The power of the oscillation is coded by the gray colour scale. The\ndashed curve indicates the umbra\u2013penumbra boundary. The numbers label the wave traces.\nThe arrows show the directions of the slits for the construction of the time\u2013distance plots\nshown in Figure 7.\n\nreleases, the configuration of the wave traces often returns back to the pre-flare\none.\nIt is interesting whether there is a relationship between the wave amplitude\nand the wave-propagation direction. To answer this question, we constructed\ntime\u2013distance plots of wave traces 1 and 4 in the time interval 02:30 \u2013 05:00 UT\nalong the slits directed along the arrows shown in Figure 6. The time-distance\nplots and their analysis are shown in Figure 7. The three-minute oscillations\nare detected during the whole observation period as almost vertical and oblique\nchevron structures in the time-distance plane. The gradient of the chevron structures allows one to estimate the phase speed of the observed waves, projected\non the plane perpendicular to the LOS. The envelopes of the three-minute wave\namplitudes and of the projected phase speeds show their high time correlation.\nTaking that the LOS is almost vertical, we obtain that the higher amplitude\ncorresponds to the higher horizontal phase speed.\nIn the corona, phase speeds of propagating longitudinal waves are known to\nbe systematically lower than the sound speed which is about 140 \u2013 180 km s\u22121\nin the EUV band (e.g. De Moortel, 2006; De Moortel, 2009).

Dynamics of the Three-Minute EUV Sources in the Corona\nFor comparison, we considered the simultaneous observations of the same active\nregion by TRACE in 171\u00c5 bandpass, at 02:43 \u2013 03:50 UT. The narrowband maps\nof the three-minute periodic variations of the EUV intensity were taken at 02:43 \u2013\n03:06, 02:56 \u2013 03:22, 03:00 \u2013 03:29, 03:13 \u2013 03:36, 03:20 \u2013 03:48 and 03:30 \u2013 03:50\nUT, shown in Figure 8.\nSimilarly to the transition region level (see Figure 6), the three-minute wave\ntraces detected in the EUV band have fine structure. The enumeration of the\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 18\n\n\fWeb-Based Data Processing System\n\nwave traces coincides with the enumeration in Figure 6. We would like to point\nout that the spatial resolution of TRACE is about an order of magnitude better\nthan of NoRH, and hence the level of detail in the EUV narrowband maps is\nmuch higher than in microwaves. However, the application of the PWF technique highlights the wave motion of specific spatial details, which reduces the\ndiscrepancy.\nThe fine structure of the three-minute wave traces at the transition region and\ncoronal levels is found to almost coincide. Thus, it is likely that these phenomena\nare caused by the same wave motion that propagates from the sunspot to the\ncorona. For example, in the transition region, trace 1 (Figure 6) coincides (accounting for the difference in spatial resolution) with the coronal wave trace seen\nin Figure 8. The magnetic field extrapolation (Figure 5d) shows that the wave\ntraces are situated on the open magnetic flux tubes. According to Section 6.1, this\ntrace correspond to a standing wave in the plane-of-the-sky. Thus, the observed\nwaves are likely to be channelled in the vertical direction by the open magnetic\nflux tube from the transition region to the corona. The increase in the wave\namplitude can cause the deformation of the wave trace pattern, see, e.g., the\nappearance of the V-shaped structures number 3 and 4 during 03:30 \u2013 03:50 UT\n(Figure 8).\nAs in the transition region, the projected phase speed measured with the\nuse of the time\u2013distance plot is found to be about 50 km s\u22121 . This value is\nconsistent with the typical value for coronal propagating compressible waves\n(King et al., 2003; McEwan and De Moortel, 2006). We should point out\nthat in some works the coronal propagating compressible waves, also\nknown as longitudinal and slow magnetoacoustic (see, e.g. Wang et al.,\n2009 and Marsh et al., 2009 for recent spectroscopic and stereoscopic\nresults, respectively), are called \"periodic coronal outflows\", see, e.g.\nSakao et al.(2007).\n\n7. Conclusions\nThe principal aim of this paper is presentation of the specialised computational\nresource http://pwf.iszf.irk.ru for the automated detection and analysis of wave\nand oscillatory processes in the solar atmosphere by remote access, and the\ndemonstration of its efficiency. The computational tool presented has a modular\nstructure, which includes algorithms for the automated localisation of oscillatory\nprocesses in time and space, analysis of their properties, and visualization of the\nresults. The system allows for easy change of the modules and parallel execution,\nwhich is crucial for fast performance and for possible future applications for realtime data analysis. The system is based upon the periodmapping technique for\nthe preliminary analysis and identification of the region and times of interest, and\nthe PWF technique for the detailed analysis. The system provides for the determination of the spatial-time-frequency-amplitude-phase dynamics and structure\nof the waves. In particular, the system allows distinguishing between standing\n(with respect to the LOS) and propagating waves. From the user's point of view,\nthe system is a web site that can be interacted with through a standard Internet\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 19\n\n\fR.A.

We are not\naware of the existence of analogous resources in solar physics, or in other areas\nof science and technology.\nThe efficiency of the discussed system was tested by the analysis of the\nthree-minute waves over the sunspot NOAA 10756 observed in the EUV and\nmicrowave bands. This study continues our previous work (Sych et. al., 2009) on\nthe phenomenological relationship between the oscillatory processes in sunspot\natmospheres and flaring energy releases, such as flares and spikes. The main emphasis of the present study was put on the analysis of three-minute waves in the\ntransition region and the corona in quite conditions. In agreement with previous\nstudies of this phenomenon (e.g., Berghmans and Clette, 1999; De Moortel et\nal., 2000; De Moortel et al., 2002a,b; Robbrecht et al., 2001; King et al., 2003; De\nMoortel, 2006), it was found that the power of narrowband three-minute periodic\nvariations of the EUV and microwave emission was localised along the locally\nopen magnetic-field lines (determined by potential-field extrapolation) near their\nfootpoints. The regions of enhanced power of the narrowband periodic variations,\ncalled wave traces, highlight the waveguiding magnetised plasma structure. The\nspatial extent of the wave traces along the magnetic field lines was found to be\nabout 20 \u2013 30\u2032\u2032 , again in agreement with previous studies.\nThe long and short-period oscillations were found to be localised in different\nregions over the sunspot. A similar feature has been noticed e.g. by Zhugzhda\n\nSOLA: Remote_Access_Ver7.tex; 22 October 2018; 6:13; p. 20\n\n\fWeb-Based Data Processing System\n\net al. (2000) and Kobanov et al. (2006) at the photospheric and chromospheric\nlevels, where three- and five-minute oscillations were detected at different parts\nof a sunspot. In the corona, this was established by De Moortel et al. (2002),\nand Sych and Nakariakov (2008). The three-minute wave traces determined\nat the transition region and coronal levels are situated at the same locations\nand have similar shape (taking into account an order-of-magnitude difference in\nthe resolution). It is very likely that we observe the same wave motion of the\nlongitudinal mode, guided along the magnetic field.\nThe analysis of the temporal evolution of three-minute wave traces revealed its\nnon-stationary nature. The projected phase speed was found to correlate with the\nwave amplitude. The change of the projected wave speed is likely to be attributed\nto the change in the magnetic-field geometry, perhaps caused by the waves. In the\ntransition region, the projected phase speed is very high, 180 \u2013 360 km\u22121 , which is\nmuch higher than the sound speed at this height. We explain this discrepancy as\na projection effect. Indeed, when the longitudinal three-minute waves propagate\nalong the magnetic flux tubes in the corona, they are localised in the transverse\ndirection, and their transverse wavelength is much smaller than the longitudinal\nwavelength. In other words, the waves are essentially non-planar. This leads to\nthe apparent decrease in the observed projected phase speed with the decrease\nin the angle between the LOS and the magnetic flux tube, reported in a number\nof papers (e.g. King et al., 2003). However, below the corona, the decrease in the\nsound speed causes the decrease in the longitudinal wavelength. Hence, the threeminute waves become more planar. This leads to the increase in their projected\nphase speed with the decrease in the angle between the LOS and the direction of\ntheir propagation. (We would like to recall that the projected phase speed of a\nplane wave propagating along the LOS is infinite). Thus, we established that in\nthe transition region the growth of the three-minute amplitude is accompanied\nby the decrease in the LOS angle to the wave-propagation direction. In other\nwords, the higher amplitude waves are observed to propagate more vertically.\nA possible interpretation of this phenomenon is the effect of the centrifugal\nforce produced by the field-aligned flows of plasma along the curved magneticfield lines. This interpretation is qualitatively consistent with the interpretation\nof the longitudinal compressible coronal waves as slow magnetoacoustic waves\n(e.g. Nakariakov et al., 2000; De Moortel, 2006; De Moortel, 2009).\nThese findings demonstrate the efficiency of the described data analysis system, its ability to bring new interesting scientific results, and its high potential\nfor coronal seismology.\nAcknowledgements The work was supported by the Royal Society UK-Russian\nInternational Joint Project, the grants RFBR 10-02-00153a, 08-02-13633-ofi-c,\n08-02-91860-KO-a and 08-02-92204-GFEN-a.
