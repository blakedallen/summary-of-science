Experimentally, this field continues to bring surprises, including enhancements\nnear p\u0304p thresholds [1, 2, 3], an exotic K + N resonance [4, 5, 6], and two new\nmesons containing c and s\u0304 quarks [7, 8]. These discoveries demonstrate that\nnon-perturbative QCD is not yet fully 'solved' [9], and underline the interest\nin developing new non-perturbative methods. The dynamics governing the\nformation of resonances in QCD is still imperfectly understood, especially the\nrelation between the spectrum and chiral symmetry breaking (\u03c7SB), possible\n'exotic' non-q\u0304q mesons and non-qqq baryons, and combinations of light and\nheavy quarks.\nQCD in one space and one time dimension, QCD2 , is an interesting laboratory for studying many of these issues. There is no spontaneous \u03c7SB in\ntwo dimensions, but a trace of the phenomenon does exist, in the sense that\n\u221a\nmP S \u221d ec mq , where mP S is the mass of the lightest pseudoscalar meson,\nec is the gauge coupling and mq is the quark mass. This formula for mP S is\nanalogous to the case in four dimensions, with ec replacing \u039bQCD .\nMotivated by this similarity and the tractability of QCD2 , we investigated\nin [10] the problem of resonances in the meson-baryon channel in this model.\nThis question is still relevant both as a crude model for the real world in four\ndimensions and also as a testing ground for non-perturbative methods that\nmight have relevance there and elsewhere.\nIn [10] we worked in the strong-coupling limit, ec /mq \u226b 1, namely in the\nlimit where the QCD2 coupling is much larger than the quark mass. This\nwould correspond in QCD4 to quark masses being small compared to the\nQCD scale, mq /\u039bQCD \u226a 1, the limit where explicit \u03c7SB is small. Moreover,\nwe worked in the approximation that the baryons are heavy compared to the\nmesons, which is justified by the large-Nc limit in QCD. In this double limit,\nwe found no resonances in meson-baryon scattering, only elastic scattering.\nThis result suggest that quark masses are essential complications in QCD,\nat least in two dimensions.\nIn the present work we relax one of our two previous assumptions, that\nof strong coupling, while retaining the assumption that baryons are heavy.\nThis discussion of general coupling may equivalently be regarded as introduc2\n\n\fing finite quark masses. We show that this generalization necessitates the\nre-introduction of colour degrees of freedom, which were decoupled in the\nprevious strong-coupling limit. The scattering problem may be formulated\nas a relativistic potential problem that differs essentially from the previous\nstrong-coupling, low-mass case. We derive the corresponding new equations\nfor meson-baryon scattering amplitudes, valid for any value of the QCD2\ncoupling.\nIn Section 2 we discuss the general formulation for QCD2 , in bosonized\nform, which is necessary for obtaining the meson-baryon scattering amplitude\nfor an arbitrary value of the coupling. We use this formulation in Section\n3 to derive the effective meson-baryon action, for arbitrary coupling in the\nheavy-baryon limit. We show that in Section 4 that, for light mesons and\nheavy baryons, the scattering problem can be transformed to problem with\nrelativistic potentials, and we evaluate that potential in two cases that are\nnon-trivial for unequal quark masses. Section 5 contains our derivation of the\nequations for scattering amplitudes, and Section 6 discusses the prospects for\nfuture work.\n\n2\n\nGeneral Formulation\n\nWe start from the discussion of [11], which presented an effective action for\nbosonized QCD2 with Nf flavours and Nc colours:\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0002 \u22121\n\u0001 \u00032\ne2c Nf\n2\n\u2020\n\u20322\nSeff [u] = S0 [u]+ 2\nd x Tr \u2202\u2212 u \u2202\u2212 u c +m Nm\u0303 d 2 x Tr u + u\u2020 ,\n8\u03c0\n(1)\nwhere the traces are over both colour and flavour. The second term is the\nresult of integrating out the gauge fields, which was made possible by the\nquadratic dependence on the gauge fields in two dimensions in the light-cone\ngauge, which we chose. Finally, S0 [u] is the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW)\naction, representing free fermions.\nThe above action is exact for any value of the gauge coupling ec . The\nmatrices u represent the bosonic version of the quark bilinears, symbolically\n\u03a8 \u2297 \u03a8\u0304, with both colour and flavour indices. The symmetry groups are\nSU(Nc ) and U(Nf ), for colour and flavour, respectively, including the U(1)\n\n3\n\n\fof baryon number, and\n\n2\n\nm\u2032 = mq C m\u0303,\n\n(2)\n1 \u03b3\ne\n2\n\nwhere mq is the quark mass, m\u0303 the normal-ordering scale, and C \u2261\n\u2248\n0.891. For a detailed discussion, see [12]. For the time being, we take all\nquarks to have the same mass.\nWhen using the product scheme for bosonization\nu = h \u00d7 g \u2261 [ SU(Nc ) ]\n[ U(N ) ]\n| {z } NF \u00d7 | {zF } Nc\ng\nh\n\n(3)\n\nand taking the strong-coupling limit ec /mq \u2192 \u221e, one can eliminate the\nsecond term in (1), after first choosing an appropriate normal-ordering scale\nm\u0303, as described in [12]. The colour degrees of freedom h are completely\neliminated in this limit, and one gets an effective action in terms of flavour\ndegrees of freedom only:\nZ\n\u0001\n2\nS\u0303eff [g] = Nc S0 [g] + m Nm d2 x Trf g + Trf g \u2020 ,\n(4)\nwhere\n\n\uf8ee\n\nm = \uf8f0Nc Cmq\n\u2206c\n\np\n\nec Nf\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\n1\n!\u2206c \uf8f9 1+\u2206\nc\n\nNc2 \u2212 1\n.\n=\nNc (Nc + NF )\n\n\uf8fb\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nNote that here the traces are over flavour only.\nAs shown in [10], this action results in elastic scattering only, and is\ntherefore unsuitable for modelling QCD4 realistically. Scattering is a soluble\nproblem in this approximation, with the transmission and reflection coefficients T and R given in [10] for all meson energies.\nWhen dealing with finite coupling, we should not use the product scheme,\nbut rather the 'u-scheme', where the original matrices u \u2208 U(NF \u00d7 Nc ). The\ntwo schemes are equivalent only when the quark masses are zero, or equivalently in the strong-coupling limit. One important aspect of the difference,\nat finite mass, is that the 'u-scheme' admits multi-soliton solutions [11] that\ndo not exist in the product scheme. Each of the solitons in these solutions carries both colour and flavour, yet the total multi-soliton solutions are\n4\n\n\fcolour-neutral. These individual coloured solitons were interpreted in [11] as\nconstituent quarks. When the quark masses are equal, the solutions can be\nobtained analytically, and are given by the sine-Gordon profile. For unequal\nquark masses, the solutions were obtained numerically.\n\n3\n\nExtension to Arbitrary Coupling\n\nWe first consider the second term of (1), for arbitrary coupling:\nZ\n\u0001 \u00032\n\u0002 \u22121\ne2c Nf\n2\n\u2020\nu\n\u2202\nu\nd\nx\nTr\n\u2202\n\u2212\n\u2212\nc\n8\u03c0 2\n\u0001\nwhere u \u2202\u2212 u\u2020 c is the colour part of M \u2261 u\u2202\u2212 u\u2020 , to be computed as\nMc = Trf M \u2212 1/Nc Trf &c M,\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nwith details to be found in [12]. As already mentioned, this term represents\nthe interactions, as it arises from integrating out the gauge potentials. However, we will see that, for the physical situation we discuss, this term does\nnot contribute to meson-baryon scattering for any coupling. As a result,\nthe latter is described by the effective action S\u0303eff [u], whereas in the strong\ncoupling limit it is described by S\u0303eff [g].\nIn order to describe meson-baryon scattering, we follow the four-dimensional\nexample [13], and take u to be of the form\nu = exp(\u2212i\u03a6c ) exp(\u2212i\u03b4\u03a6),\n\n(9)\n\ncorresponding to a classical soliton \u03a6c representing one of the baryons described in [11], and a small fluctuation \u03b4\u03a6 around it, representing the meson.\nThe resulting action is then expanded to second order in \u03b4\u03a6, yielding a linear\nequation of motion for \u03b4\u03a6 in the soliton background.

We note that there is the possibility of\nan overall scale ambiguity in m, since, when the masses are different, there is\na question which normal-ordering scale to use, as discussed in the Appendix\nof [11]. The resulting equation of motion for \u03b4\u03a6 is\n\u0003\u03b4\u03a6 \u2212 i (\u2202+ \u03a6c ) (\u2202\u2212 \u03b4\u03a6) + i (\u2202\u2212 \u03b4\u03a6) (\u2202+ \u03a6c ) +\n\u0003\n1\u0002\n\u03b4\u03a6\u03bc2 exp(\u2212i\u03a6c ) + exp(i\u03a6c )\u03bc2 \u03b4\u03a6 = 0,\n2\n\u221a\nwhere \u03bc \u2261 m 8\u03c0.\n\n(20)\n\nAs discussed before, both \u03a6c and \u03b4\u03a6 are diagonal in colour. Moreover,\n\u03a6c is diagonal in flavour too. So, taking the \u03b1\u03b1jj \u2032 matrix element of the\nequation of motion (20), we find\n\u0003\u03b4\u03a6\u03b1jj \u2032 \u2212 i(\u2202+ \u03a6c )\u03b1j (\u2202\u2212 \u03b4\u03a6)\u03b1jj \u2032 +i (\u2202\u2212 \u03b4\u03a6)\u03b1jj \u2032 (\u2202+ \u03a6c )\u03b1j \u2032 +\n1\n{\u03b4\u03a6\u03b1jj \u2032 \u03bc2 j \u2032 [exp(\u2212i\u03a6c )]\u03b1j \u2032 + [exp(i\u03a6c )]\u03b1j \u03bc2 j \u03b4\u03a6\u03b1jj \u2032 } = 0.\n2\n\n(21)\n\nExamining the classical solutions for the quark solitons inside the baryons as\nin [11], we see that, for a given colour index \u03b1, there is only one flavour for\nwhich \u03a6c is non-zero. We can now distinguish three cases.\n\u2022 The first is when an index \u03b1 and indices j and j \u2032 are chosen in such a\nway that both (\u03a6c )\u03b1j and (\u03a6c )\u03b1j \u2032 are zero. In such a case,\n1\n\u0003\u03b4\u03a6\u03b1jj \u2032 + [\u03bc2 j + \u03bc2 j \u2032 ]\u03b4\u03a6\u03b1jj \u2032 = 0,\n2\nwhere(\u03a6c )\u03b1j = 0 and (\u03a6c )\u03b1j \u2032 = 0.\n7\n\n(22)\n\n\fThus \u03b4\u03a6\u03b1jj \u2032 is a free field with squared mass given by the average of m2j and\nm2j \u2032 in this case, which we do not discuss further.\n\u2022 The second case is that of j = j \u2032 , with \u03b1 such that (\u03a6c )\u03b1j is a quark\nsoliton inside the baryon. In this case,\n\u0003\u03b4\u03a6\u03b1jj + \u03bc2 j cos[(\u03a6c )\u03b1j ]\u03b4\u03a6\u03b1jj = 0.\n\n(23)\n\nThis case is analogous to the case in Section 2 of [10], with the difference\nthat here the potential is determined by \u03a6c which, for the case of unequal\nmasses, is not necessarily of the sine-Gordon type.\n\u2022 The third case is when j is different from j \u2032 , now with one of the \u03a6c\nbeing a soliton and the other vanishing. Taking (\u03a6c )\u03b1j to be the soliton, we\nobtain\n1\n\u0003\u03b4\u03a6\u03b1jj \u2032 \u2212 i(\u2202+ \u03a6c )\u03b1j (\u2202\u2212 \u03b4\u03a6)\u03b1jj \u2032 + {\u03bc2 j \u2032 + \u03bc2 j [exp(i\u03a6c )]\u03b1j }\u03b4\u03a6\u03b1jj \u2032 = 0, (24)\n2\n\u2032\nwhere\nj 6= j and (\u03a6c )\u03b1j \u2032 = 0\nThis case is analogous to Section 4 of [10], but with the same difference as in\n(23), i.e., that for unequal masses the soliton is not of the sine-Gordon type.\n\n5\n\nEvaluation of Meson-Baryon Scattering\n\nThe equations which determine the static solution (\u03a6c )\u03b1j were derived in [11].\nFor completeness, we include them here too.

These effective potentials\nare not of the sine-Gordon type found in previous cases, and we expect the\nscattering amplitudes also to be non-trivial. Their calculation will require\nnumerical analysis, that we postpone for a future occasion.\nClearly QCD2 is not a complete laboratory for studying non-perturbative\nphysics in QCD4 . However, it is already quite a rich system, and full QCD can\nonly be richer still. We have already pointed out the existence of constituent\nquark solitons in QCD2 [11], and this numerical analysis may cast light on\ntheir importance in scattering, where the additive quark model has long been\nan intriguing approximation.\nIt is intriguing that the introduction of unequal quark masses is an essential complication. We recall that the light-cone wave functions for mesons\ncontaining unequal quark masses are expected not to be symmetric, resulting in a net colour field that underlies this effect. One task of numerical\n11\n\n\fanalysis will be to see what new physics this produces in meson-baryon\nscattering and possibly in resonant states. We note that two of the recent\nnew puzzles in non-perturbative QCD concern systems with unequal quark\nmasses [4, 5, 7, 8]. It would be hubristic to suggest that the continuation of\nour QCD2 studies will cast light on these puzzles, but they will provide some\nextra motivation for our future work in this direction.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe research of one of us (M.K.) was supported in part by a grant from the\nUnited States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF), Jerusalem and by\nthe Einstein Center for Theoretical Physics at the Weizmann Institute.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
