It was also remarked that the light\nreceived at the earth's from a direction different than that of the sun, should\nbe the product of the radiation field in the atmosphere and 1/\u03bb4 .\nIn the present article, we will be interested in the nature of the glow horizon\nobserved from earth at sunsrise, or sunset.\n\n2\n\nData\n\nThe data was acquired at the Fujii Bisei Observatory (Bisei Okayama, Japan,\nhttp://www1.harenet.ne.jp/ \u0303 aikow/). The telescope is a 28 cm reflector. The\nslit width of the spectroscope is 0.1 mm with a dispersion of 32.8 nm/mm. The\nspectral resolution is 1 nm. The wavelength range sampled by the spectrograph\nis 4400 \u00c5 to 7150 \u00c5.\nFor this observational program, morning grow spectra, and near zenith blue\nskys, were obtained during three observing runs, in the early mornings of\nNovember 11, 2001, January 11, 2002 and June 1, 2002. November 2001 and\nJanuary 2002 spectra are observations of the red horizon at sunrise, at different\nelevations. The three spectra of June 2002 are blue sky, high altitude spectra.\nThe blue spectra are proportional one to the other, so that only one is used\nin the paper. The sky was clear for the three observing runs. Information on\nthe observations is given in Table 1.\nA dark exposure is substracted from the raw spectra. The spectra are then flatfielded using the spectrum of a tungsten lamp. We did not require an absolute\ncalibration for the spectra since we were interested only by their shape. The\nspectra presented in the paper are all normalised by a spectrum of the sun,\nkindly furnished by G. Thuillier (Thuillier et al., 2003). The normalised spectra\nare set to 1.0 in their short wavelength part.\n\n3\n\nAnalysis\n\n3.1 General considerations on the shape of the spectra\nRun 1 and run 2 spectra are separately plotted in Figure 1. Moving from the\nnear-UV to the near-infrared, the spectra consist in an exponential decrease\n2\n\n\fFig. 1. Spectra of the glow at sunrise observed from Fujii Bisei Observatory.

The impression of 'red', one has\nwhen looking at the horizon at sunrise or sunrise, depends on the level of the\nbump.\nThe blue spectra consist of the exponential decrease solely (left plot of Figure 2); the red bump has disappeared. These high altitude observations of a\nclear sky must be backscattering of slightly extinguished sunlight from the\n4\n\n\fFig. 2. Spectrum of a blue sky observed from Fujii Bisei Observatory. left: Spectrum (b1) observed in June 2002. right: Ratio of a blue sky spectrum (spectrum\n(b1)) to a red sky spectrum (spectrum (4)).\n\natmosphere along the line of sight.\nFor reasons of continuity, the blue part of the red spectra at the highest\naltitudes probably comprise a part of slightly extinguished scattered sunlight,\nwith a spectrum similar to the blue light spectrum.\nThe reddest spectra are the result of a longer optical paths of the sunlight necessarily through the outermost part of the atmosphere- followed by scattering. Since the outer atmosphere is mainly gas, the red spectra can be expected\nto be a mixture of gas extinction of sunlight between the sun and the scatter4\ning volume (Rayleigh extinction e\u2212a/\u03bb + ozone absorption with cross-section\n\u03c3\u03bb , = e\u2212NO3 \u03c3\u03bb ), followed by Rayleigh scattering (\u221d 1/\u03bb4 ).\nThe presence of important absorption by ozone in the red spectra is manifest in\nthe ratio of blue to red spectra (the bump in the 5000 \u00c5 to 6500 \u00c5 wavelength\nregion, right plot of Figure 2). Empirical relations between the red spectra\nalso confirm the importance of ozone absorption: the blue parts of the red\nspectra deduce one from the other by an exponential of 1/\u03bb (Figure 3). Similar\nrelations, with exponents of opposit sign, exist between the red parts of the\nspectra. These relations can be related to the extinction cross section of ozone\n(Zagury & Goutail, 2003), \u03c3\u03bb , which is linear in 1/\u03bb from 1.4 \u03bcm\u22121 to 1.7 \u03bcm\u22121\n(with a positive slope) and from 1.7 \u03bcm\u22121 to 2 \u03bcm\u22121 (with a negative slope).\nIt follows that the blue decreases in the red spectra can have two origins: blue\nlight scattered by the inner parts of the atmosphere, or absorption by ozone.\n5\n\n\fTable 2\nFits used in Figure 4 and Figure 5\nn\u25e6\n\nFit\n\n(1)\n\nRed (lowest latitude) spectra (Figure 4)\n4\n\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\ne\u22120.032/\u03bb /\u03bb4\n\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\ne\u22120.014/\u03bb /\u03bb4\n\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\ne\u22120.055/\u03bb /\u03bb4\n\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\ne\u22120.030/\u03bb /\u03bb4\n\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\ne\u22120.010/\u03bb /\u03bb4\n\n4\n\n\u221d e\u22122.2 10\n\n5\n\n\u221d e\u22122.0 10\n\n11\n\n\u221d e\u22122.8 10\n\n12\n\n\u221d e\u22122.3 10\n\n13\n\n\u221d e\u22122.3 10\n\n4\n\n4\n4\n4\n\nRed spectra with a blue sky component (Figure 5)\ne\u22120.001/\u03bb /\u03bb4\n\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\ne\u22120.015/\u03bb /\u03bb4\n\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\ne\u22120.011/\u03bb /\u03bb4\n\n\u221d e\u22122.7 10\n\n2\n\n\u221d e\u22122.2 10\n\n3a\n\n\u221d e\u22122.1 10\n\n4\n\n4\n\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\n\u221d e\u22122.2 10\n\n3b\n14a\n\n4\n\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\n1\n\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\n\u221d e\u22122.3 10\n\n14b\n\n/\u03bb4\n\n/\u03bb4 + \u03b1(b1)\n20 \u03c3\n\u03bb\n\n\u221d e\u22122.3 10\n\n(2)\n\n/\u03bb4\n\n(1) \u03c3\u03bb is the wavelength-dependent absorption cross-section of ozone.\n(2) \u03b1 a constant.\n\nFinally, the red spectra should be the sum of a red and a blue components,\nweighted by the ozone absorption. For a given time, at a constant azimuth, the\nlowest latitude spectra should be dominated by the red light and an important\nozone depression. This depression and the importance of the red bump will\ndiminish with the increase of altitude. Still increasing the altitude, blue light\nshould appear towards the near-UV first, and progressively replaces red light.\n\n3.2 Fit of the spectra\n\nThe reddest spectra, spectra 3, 4, 5 of November 2001 and spectra 1 and 2\n4\nof January 2002, are well fitted by a function \u221d e\u2212\u03b1/\u03bb \u2212\u03b2oz(\u03bb) /\u03bb4 (Figure 4),\nexpected for gas extinction and scattering of sunlight.\nIt is also possible to adjust a similar fit to the higher altitude red spectra,\nbut the result is not as satisfying (see spectrum (3b) of Figure 5).

The fit are a combination of Rayleigh\n4\nextinction (\u221d e\u2212a/\u03bb \u2212oz(\u03bb) /\u03bb4 ) and ozone absorption, in agreement with what is\nexpected from gas extinction in the upper atmosphere.\n\n8\n\n\fFig. 5. For the high altitudes spectra, the fit cannot be reduced to a one component\ngas extinction. The fit adopted in Figure 4 is less satisfying, as shown for spectrum (3), fit (3b). This fit still applies to the red part of the spectra, but a second\ncomponent is necessary to account for the blue part. For spectrum (14), the fit (14a)\nis a two additive components fit, one for the red part and an additional blue part\nproportional to blue spectrum (b1).\n9\n\n\ffit to the red part of these spectra (Figure 5) does not account for all of the\nblue side. An additional component is necessary to complete the fit, which we\nassume is the merging blue light.\nSpectrum (14a) of Figure 5 shows the fit which can be obtained by adding a\nfraction of blue sky (blue spectrum (1b) of June 2002) to the red fit.\nWe did not attempt to fit the blue spectra of June 2002, because of the difficulty of finding the proper analytical expression from these three blue spectra\nalone, in this limited wavelength range.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nOur purpose was to understand the nature of the red light in the horizon at\nsunset, or sunrise, and to fit the corresponding spectra.\nContrary to what seems to be indicated, the shape of the spectra -a blue\ncontinuum followed by a red bump- spectra of a glow horizon are not simply\nthe sum of scattered sunlight by two media (or two different kind of particles)\non the same line of sight.\nThe reddest (lowest atltitudes) spectra of a glow horizon are due to sunlight\nextinguished by the gas (Rayleigh extinction + ozone absorption) in the outermost parts of the atmosphere and scattered -still by the gas (mainly nitrogen)in the direction of the observer. Extinction of the scattered light by the gas\ncan also happen but should be a minor effect. In any case, this will not change\nthe analytical expression of the fit.\nThe radiation field at the scattering volume location is the simplest one observed by the SAOZ balloon experiment (Zagury & Goutail, 2003) and scales\n4\nas e\u2212a/\u03bb \u2212NO3 oz(\u03bb) . The scattered light received at the earth's surface is the\nproduct of this extinguished sunlight and of 1/\u03bb4.\nTowards the longer wavelengths, Rayleigh extinction is less important; the red\n4\nspectra must vary as 1/\u03bb4 (the e\u2212a/\u03bb term becomes negligible). Thus, we can\npredict that the long wavelength part of the red bumps will vary as 1/\u03bb4 .\nThe impression of 'red' has two origins. One is due to the average slope of the\nspectra, more pronounced when moving to higher altitudes and bluer regions\nof the sky. Second, this impression is increased by the ozone deficit feature,\nespecially towards the lowest altitudes, because of a larger optical path and\nozone absorption in the outermost atmosphere. The longest the optical path\nof sunrays at the horizon, the redder the spectrum will appear.\n10\n\n\fAt intermediate altitudes, in between the red light at low altitude and the\nblue near-zenith sky, we found transition spectra which are the sum of a blue\ncomponent and of a red one.\nThere are striking similarities between the spectra presented here and the\nspectra of some red nebulae, the best example being spectra in Orion observed\nby Perrin & Sivan (1992). It is currently admitted that the red color of these\nnebulae must result from an emission process. The example of the red horizon\nsuggests the possibility of other explanations for the red color of these nebulae.\n\nReferences\nPerrin, J.M., Sivan, J.P., 1992, A&A, 255, 271\nThuillier, G., et al., 2003, 'The solar spectral irradiance from 200 to 2400 nm\nas measured by SOLSPEC spectrometer from the ATLAS and EURECA\nmissions', accepted for publication in Solar Physics\nZagury, F., Goutail, F., 2003, 'Spectral analysis of extinguished sunlight', accepted for publication in New Astronomy\n\n11\n\n\f"}
