Such presentations\nsupport us to study each knot itself, and the relationship among the knots in the set of\nlens space surgeries.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf r/s Dehn surgery on a knot K in S 3 yields the lens space L(p, q), we call the pair (K, r/s)\na lens space surgery, and we also say that K admits a lens space surgery, and that r/s is the\ncoefficient of the lens space surgery. The task of classifying lens space surgeries, especially\nknots that admit lens space surgeries has been a focal point in low-dimensional topology and\nhas been invigorated of late by results from the Heegaard Floer homology theories of Ozsv\u00e1th\u2013\nSz\u00e1bo [OSz] (see also [He], [Ta] and so on). Before the first hyperbolic examples found by\nFintushel\u2013Stern [FS] in 1980, only torus knots (Moser [Mo]) and their 2-cables (Bailey\u2013Rolfsen\n[BR]) were known. After [FS], some more examples were found (see [Ma]). In 1990, Berge\n[Bg] pointed out a \"mechanism\" of known lens space surgery, that is, doubly-primitive knots\nin the Heegaard surface of genus 2. Berge also gave a conjecturally complete list of such knots,\ndescribed them by Osborne\u2013Stevens's \"R-R diagrams\" in [OSt], and classified such knots into\nthree families, and into 12 types in detail:\n(1) Knots in a solid torus (Type I, II, ... and VI)\nDehn surgery along a knot in a solid torus whose resulting manifold is also a solid torus.\nThis family was studied in [Bg2].\n(2) Knots in genus-one fiber surface (Type VII and VIII)\nDehn surgery along a knot in the genus-one fiber surface (of the right/left-handed trefoil\n(Type VII) or of figure eight (Type VIII)), see [Ba, Ba3] and [Y1].\n(3) Sporadic examples (a), (b), (c) and (d) (Type IX, X, XI and XII, respectively)\n0\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 57M25, 14H50 Secondary 55A25.\nKeywords: Dehn surgery, plane curves\n1\nThis work was partially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research No.18740029, Japan Society for\nthe Promotion of Science.\n\n1\n\n\fTheir surgery coefficients are also decided. Thus we call them Berge's knots of lens space\nsurgery, or Berge's lens space surgeries. The numbering VII, * * * and XII are also used in the\nrecent works by Baker in [Ba2, Ba3]. It is conjectured by Gordon [Go1, Go2] that every knot\nof lens space surgery is a doubly-primitive knot. Berge has claimed that his list of doublyprimitive knots is complete (i.e., any doubly-primitive knot belongs to (1), (2) or (3)), but it\nhas not appeared.\nIn the present paper, we are concerned with the family (1). Its subfamily Type I consists\nof torus knots. Type II consists of 2-cables of torus knots. Their presentations as A'Campo's\ndivide knots are already studied in [GHY] and [Y2]. Thus our targets are Type III, IV, V and\nVI.\nNotation. Throughout the paper, we let the symbol X denote one of these Types, i.e., X =\nIII, IV, V or VI.\nTo describe the knots in each Type X, in [Bg2], Berge defined five parameters \u03b4, \u03b5 \u2208 {\u00b11}\nand A, B, b \u2208 Z (They satisfy some certain conditions depending on X). We introduce two\nnew parameters k, t such that B, b are uniquely calculated from k, t and vice-versa. By\nKX(\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t), we mean the knot defined by the parameters in Type X. (Type VI is slightly\ndifferent from the others.) Taking opposite \u03b4 corresponds to the mirror image of the knot.\nNote that, if a lens space surgery (K, r) belongs to Type X, (K!, \u2212r) is also a lens space\nsurgery and belongs to the same Type X, where K! is the mirror image of K. See Section 2\nfor details on the parameters.\n\nFigure 1: Pretzel knot (\u22122, 3, 7) with coefficient 18\nThe theory of A'Campo's divide knots and links comes from singularity theory of complex\ncurves. The divide is (originally) a relative, generic immersion of a 1-manifold in a unit disk\nin R2 . A'Campo [A1, A2, A3, A4] formulated the way to associate to each divide C a link\nL(C) in S 3 . In the present paper, we regard a PL (piecewise linear) plane curve as a divide\nby smoothing the corners. The class of divide links properly contains the class of the links\narising from isolated singularities of complex curves, i.e., positive torus knots, and iterated\ntorus knots satisfying certain inequalities in their parameters.\nDefinition 1.1 Let X be the \u03c0/4-lattice defined by {(x, y)| cos \u03c0x = cos \u03c0y} in xy-plane\n(R2 ). By an L-shaped region, we mean a union of two rectangles sharing a corner and overlapping along an edge of one, where rectangles are assumed that all edges are parallel to either\n2\n\n\fx-axis or y-axis, and that all vertices are at lattice points (\u2208 Z2 ). We call a plane curve an\nL-shaped curve if the curve P is obtained as an intersection X \u2229 L of X and an L-shaped\nregion L. We define area(P ) of an L-shaped curve P = X \u2229 L as the area (2-dim. volume) of\nthe L-shaped region L defining P .\nSee Figure 1. It is the starting example of our results. The L-shaped curve P = X \u2229 L, as\na divide, presents the pretzel knot of type (\u22122, 3, 7). Its 18 surgery is a lens space, which is\none of the examples in [FS]. Note that the area of P is equal to 18, the coefficient of the lens\nspace surgery. Our main result is:\nTheorem 1.2 Up to mirror image, every Berge's knot of lens space surgery in Type III, IV,\nV and VI is one of A'Campo's divide knots, and can be presented by an L-shaped curve.\nIn fact, for the given parameters X and (\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t), we will construct an L-shaped curve\nPX(\u03b5, A, k, t) = X \u2229 LX(\u03b5, A, k, t), see Demonstration in Subsection 4.4. Note that opposite \u03b4\ncorresponds to the mirror image.\nTheorem 1.3 Our L-shaped curve PX(\u03b5, A, k, t) presents the Berge's knot KX(\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t)\nin Type X (X = III, IV, V or VI), up to mirror image:\nL( PX(\u03b5, A, k, t) ) = KX(1, \u03b5, A, k, t), or its mirror image KX(\u22121, \u03b5, A, k, t).\nOne of KX(\u00b11, \u03b5, A, k, t) is presented by a positive braid (say w) and the other is by a\nnegative one (the inverse w\u22121 ). The divide knot L( PX(\u03b5, A, k, t) ) is exactly equal to the\npositive one, but the choice at \u03b4 (1 or \u22121) depends on X and (\u03b5, A, k, t).\nNext, we study the surgery coefficients. By the Cyclic Surgery Theorem of Culler\u2013Gordon\u2013\nLuecke\u2013Shalen [CGLS], if a hyperbolic knot K admits a lens space surgery, then the coefficient\nis integral. By coef(KX(\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t)), we denote the surgery coefficient of the lens space surgery\nof the knot as in Type X. Note that there exist some hyperbolic knots that have two coefficients of lens space surgery (such coefficients are proved to be consecutive in [CGLS]), and\nbelong to different Types as the pairs with the coefficients. It is the reason why we state \"as\nin Type X\".\nTheorem 1.4 Under the correspondence in Theorem 1.3, the area of the L-shaped curve P\nis equal to (the absolute value of) the coefficient of the lens space surgery of L(P ) as in Type\nX, or is greater by one:\narea(P ) \u2212 |coef(L(P ))| = 0 or 1.\nThis theorem will be proved as Lemma 5.3, in which we will decide the choice (0 or 1) by\nthe parameters. We will prove that coef(L(P )) > 0 in Lemma 5.1. Thus we will change\n|coef(L(P ))| to coef(L(P )) in Lemma 5.3.\nTheorem 1.2 can be proved by combination of Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 3.8. But the aim\nof the present paper is the construction of the L-shaped curves using the operation adding\nsquares on L-shaped curves in Section 4, and studying the knots and the family of knots by\nthem. Some knots are obtained from other knots (possibly in other Types) by some twistings.\nBy our method adding squares, we can search such pairs, and check such relations easily, see\nSection 6.\n3\n\n\fHere we survey on divide presentation of the other Berge's knots (in Type VII and later),\nshortly. All knots are considered up to mirror image. Type VII consists of the knots that the\nauthor [Y1] gave L-shaped curve presentations first. Type VIII contains some knots that is\nhard (in the author's opinion) to decide whether it is a divide knot or not, and (if it is) to\npresent by a divide. The author has shown that every sporadic knot (in Type IX and later) is\na divide knot and has shown a method to construct the divide. But he does not know whether\nit can be presented by an L-shaped curve or not.\nNote that there exist a family of L-shaped divide knot whose area(P )-surgery is not a lens\nspace [Y3], but such L-shaped divide knots tend to have exceptional Dehn surgeries, to the\nauthor's knowledge [Y2, Y4].\nThis paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we review Berge's knots and\ntheir parameters in detail. In Section 3, we review A'Campo's divide knot theory and define\nL-shaped curves. In Section 4, developing a method adding squares, we construct L-shaped\ncurves (regions) for Berge's knots. In Section 5, we will prove Theorem 1.3 and Lemma 5.3, the\nprecise version of Theorem 1.4. Finally, in Section 6, we study some applications, advantages\nto present Berge's knots as divide knots. We place Tables 1 and 2 after the reference list for\nthe reader's convenience.\n\n2\n\nBerge's knots of Type III, IV, V and VI\n\nWe recall the Berge's parametrization of knots in Type X. We use his original parameters\n\u03b4, \u03b5, A, B, b and a constant a (:= 0 or 1) defined in [Bg2], and introduce two new parameters\nk and t.\nWe start with the following:\n(1) * \u03b4 and \u03b5 are signs (\u2208 {\u00b11}). The opposite \u03b4 corresponds to the mirror image.\n* A is a positive integer, whose range and parity (even or odd) depends on X,\n* k runs in N\u22650 . B is decided by (\u03b5, A, k) and satisfies that 0 < 2A \u2264 B.\n* b, t \u2208 Z. They can be negative.\n(2) The parameters k, t are introduced instead of the conditions in [Bg2] written by sentences\nand by congruences, respectively. For example, instead of \"(B + \u03b5)/A is an odd integer\"\nin [Bg2, Table 3(p.15)], we set B = A(3 + 2k) \u2212 \u03b5. Instead of \"b \u2261 \u22122\u03b5\u03b4A (mod B)\"\nin [Bg2, Table 3(p.15)], we set b = \u2212\u03b4\u03b5(2A + tB). These are the relations between\n(B, b) and (k, t) in Type III. They are similar in other Types, but slightly different, see\nTable 1(1).\n(3) The independent parameters are (\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t) in Type III, IV and V, but is (\u03b4, A, t) in\nType VI. We formally regard the latter as (\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t) = (\u03b4, \u22121, A, 0, t), i.e., we fix\n\u03b5 := \u22121, k := 0 in Type VI, for the convenience.\nNotation. By KX(\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t), we denote the knot parametrized as (\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t) in Type X,\nby Berge in [Bg2].\nNow we go into the detail. See Table 1(1), (2) and (3). In Table 1(1), we define B and b\n(depending on X), using a temporary parameter l. For fixed A and \u03b5, the possible values of l\n4\n\n\fare in an arithmetic sequence, depending on X. We parametrize the sequence by k \u2208 N\u22650 as\nin Table 1(2). In every case, the surgery coefficient is bB + \u03b4A, where B depends on \u03b5, A, k.\nIn Table 1(3), we deform the coefficients into the form including the terms +kA2 + tB 2 (or\n+k(2A)2 + tB 2 in Type III). These are related to our method adding squares in Section 4.\nNote that, if a knot K with coefficient r belongs to Type X, its mirror image K! with \u2212r (i.e.,\nopposite \u03b4) also belongs to the same Type X.\nUsing these parameters, in [Bg2], Berge has already given the braid presentations of these\nknots:\nLemma 2.1 (Berge [Bg2]) Every knot KX(\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t) is presented as the closure of the\nbraid W (B)b W (A + 1 \u2212 a)\u03b4 of index B, where W (n) = \u03c3n\u22121 \u03c3n\u22122 * * * \u03c31 , see Figure 3.\nDefinition 2.2 We define an anti-homomorphic (i.e., \u03c1(\u03b21 \u03b22 ) = \u03c1(\u03b22 )\u03c1(\u03b21 )) involution \u03c0\u03c1\nrotation \u03c1 on the braid group of index n by extending \u03c1(\u03c3i ) = \u03c3n\u2212i , see Figure 2. By \u03b2 \u2032 = \u03b2,\nwe mean \u03b2 \u2032 = \u03c1(\u03b2) and equivalently \u03c1(\u03b2 \u2032 ) = \u03b2.\nIn this opportunity, we define another notation \u03b2 \u2032 \u223c \u03b2 as that the closure of \u03b2 \u2032 is the same\n\u03c1\nknot or link to that of \u03b2. Note that \u03b2 \u2032 = \u03b2 up to conjugate implies \u03b2 \u2032 \u223c \u03b2.\n\nFigure 2: \u03c0-rotation \u03c1\nOur L-shaped divide knots are always presented by positive braids, see Section 3, while any\ndivide knot is a closure of a strongly quai-positive braid (Lemma 3.2(7)). Thus, first, if b < 0,\nwe take the mirror image (i.e., change the sign \u03b4, then b becomes to \u2212b > 0) and next, we use\nthe following lemma if it is necessary.\nLemma 2.3 Let a1 , a2 and c be positive integers with a1 < a2 . The closure of the braid\nW (a2 )c W (a1 )\u22121 of index a2 is the same knot to that of W (a2 )c\u22121 W (a2 \u2212 a1 + 1).\nProof.\nW (a2 )W (a1 )\u22121 = \u03c3a2 \u22121 \u03c3a2 \u22122 * * * \u03c3a1 * * * \u03c32 \u03c31 (\u03c3a1 \u22121 * * * \u03c32 \u03c31 )\u22121\n= \u03c3a2 \u22121 \u03c3a2 \u22122 * * * \u03c3a1\n\u03c1\n\n= W (a2 \u2212 a1 + 1).\nSince \u03c0-rotation \u03c1 is anti-homomorphic, and the braid W (n) of index n (= a2 ) is fixed by \u03c1,\nwe have\nW (a2 )c W (a1 )\u22121 = W (a2 )c\u22121 * W (a2 )W (a1 )\u22121\n\u03c1\n\n= W (a2 \u2212 a1 + 1)W (a2 )c\u22121 ,\nwhich is conjugate to W (a2 )c\u22121 W (a2 \u2212 a1 + 1). \u0003\nFigure 3 illustrates Lemma 2.3.

It is a method to associate to each divide (a plane curve) C a\nlink L(C) in the 3-dimensional sphere S 3 . The original definition of divide knots in [A1] is\ndifferential-geometric. Hirasawa [Hi] visualized the construction. We are concerned with the\nplane curves of special type, called \"L-shaped curves\", see Subsection 3.2. For such special\ncurves, we can use another method introduced by Couture\u2013Perron [CP], see Subsection 3.3.\n\n3.1\n\nA'Campo's divide knots\n\nWe start with the typical example of divide knots, see Figure 4:\nLemma 3.1 (Goda\u2013Hirasawa\u2013Y [GHY], see also [AGV, Gu]) Let a, b be a pair of positive\nintegers and R(a, b) be an a \u00d7 b-rectangle region. A plane curve defined by X \u2229 R(a, b) (a\nbilliard curve of type B(a, b)) presents the torus link T (a, b) as a divide.\n\nFigure 4: A billiard curve presents a torus knot (ex. T (6, 5))\nSome characterizations of (general) divide knots and links are known, and some topological\ninvariants L(P ) can be gotten from the divide P directly. Here, we list some of them.\nLemma 3.2 ((1)\u2013(6) by A'Campo [A2], (7) by Hirasawa [Hi], Rudolph [R])\n(1) L(P ) is a knot (i.e., connected) if and if only P is an immersed arc.\n6\n\n\f(2) If L(P ) is a knot, the unknotting number, genus and 4-genus of L(P ) are all equal to\nthe number d(P ) of the double points of P .\n(3) If P = P1 \u222a P2 is the image of an immersion of two arcs, then the linking number of the\ntwo component link L(P ) = L(P1 ) \u222a L(P2 ) is equal to the number of the intersection\npoints between P1 and P2 .\n(4) If P is connected, then L(P ) is fibered.\n(5) A divide P and its mirror image P ! present the same knot or link: L(P !) = L(P ).\n(6) If P1 and P2 are related by some \u2206-moves, then the links L(P1 ) and L(P2 ) are isotopic:\nIf P1 \u223c\u2206 P2 then L(P1 ) = L(P2 ), see Figure 5.\n(7) Any divide knot is a closure of a strongly quasi-positive braid, i.e., a product of some\n\u03c3ij in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5: Basics on divide knots\nFor theory of divide knots, see also Rudolph's \"C-link\" in [R] and [C, HW].\n\n3.2\n\nPreliminary on L-shaped curves\n\nFirst, we parametrize L-shaped regions by four positive integers a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 that satisfy\na1 < a2 and b1 < b2 , see Figure 6:\nDefinition 3.3 (L-shaped region at the origin)\n\nIn xy-plane, we define\n\nL[a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] := {(x, y)| 0 \u2264 x \u2264 a1 , 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b2 }\n\u222a{(x, y)| 0 \u2264 x \u2264 a2 , 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b1 }.\nBy concave corner, we mean the point (of the region) at the coordinate (a1 , b1 ) in the definition\nabove. We will call not only L := L[a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] but also its transformations L = T (L) an\nL-shaped region of type [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ], where T is a transformation in xy-plane generated by\nthe reflection rX along the x-axis (Lemma 3.2(5)), the rotation R by \u03c0/2 about a lattice point\nand the parallel translation +~n by a lattice point ~n (\u2208 Z2 ).\nLet X be the \u03c0/4-lattice defined by {(x, y)| cos \u03c0x = cos \u03c0y} in xy-plane. A lattice point\n(m, n) (\u2208 Z2 ) is called even (or odd, resp.) if m + n is even (or odd). We are concerned only\nwith the case that the intersection X \u2229 L is the image of a generic immersed arc. Thus, we\nalways control +~n and assume that\n(\u2217) The concave point of an L-shaped region L is placed at an odd point.\n7\n\n\fFigure 6: L-shaped region L[3, 5; 3, 4]\n\nAssuming (\u2217), the parameter [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] defines a unique plane curve up to isotopy, i.e., it\ndepends on neither rX , R nor translations keeping even/odd points. We call the corresponding\nplane curve an L-shaped curve of type [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ]. Of course, for an L-shaped curve P of\ntype [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ], we have\narea(P ) = a2 b1 + a1 b2 \u2212 a1 b1 .\nOn the other hand, the number d(L) of double points of L is\nd(P ) = {a2 (b1 \u2212 1) + b2 (a1 \u2212 1) \u2212 a1 b1 + 1}/2,\nbecause double points are the even points of the interior of the L-shaped region.\nThe condition (\u2217) is not sufficient for X \u2229 L to be the image of an immersed arc. In fact,\nit possibly consists of multiple components or contains some circle components.\nThe following proposition follows from Lemma 3.2(2).\nProposition 3.4 If the L-shaped curve P = X \u2229L of type [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] with the assumption\n(\u2217) is an immersed arc, then the genus g(L(P )) of the divide knot L(P ) is (the unknotting\nnumber, and the 4-genus are also) equal to the number d(P ) of the double points of P :\ng(L(P )) = {a2 (b1 \u2212 1) + b2 (a1 \u2212 1) \u2212 a1 b1 + 1}/2.\nThus, it holds that area(P ) \u2212 2g(L(P )) = a2 + b2 \u2212 1.\n\n3.3\n\nL-shaped divide knots\n\nIn [CP] Couture and Perron pointed out a method to get the braid presentation from the\ndivide (the plane curve) in the restricted cases, called \"ordered Morse\" divides. Our L-shaped\ncurves are all ordered Morse, thus we can apply their method. It is a special case of Hirasawa's\nmethod in [Hi].\nLemma 3.5 The divide link presented by the L-shaped curve of type [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] is the\nclosure of the braid W (a2 )b1 W (a1 )b2 \u2212b1 of index a2 , where W (n) = \u03c3n\u22121 \u03c3n\u22122 * * * \u03c31 .\nSuch a link should be regarded as a \"rationally twisted\" torus link in the following sense: The\nlink is obtained by a \"(b2 \u2212 b1 )/a1 twist\" of the parallel a1 strings in a2 strings of torus link\nT (a2 , b1 ) in the standard position W (a2 )b1 .\n8\n\n\fExample 3.6 The divide knot presented by the L-shaped curve [3, 5; 3, 4] is the closure of\nthe braid (\u03c32 \u03c34 \u03c31 \u03c33 )3 \u03c32 \u03c31 (conjugate to (\u03c34 \u03c33 \u03c32 \u03c31 )3 \u03c32 \u03c31 ) of index 5, which is P (\u22122, 3, 7).\nProof.\n\nFirst, we define the words o(n) and e(n) in the braid group of index a2 as follows:\nY\nY\ne(n) :=\n\u03c3i ,\no(n) :=\n\u03c3i ,\ni: even, i<n\n\ni: odd, i<n\n\nwhere n is a positive integer less than or equal to the index. Note that \u03c3i and \u03c3j are commutative if i and j have the same parity. If j \u2264 k < l and k is even, o(k)\u22121 o(l) is a product of\n\u03c3i 's with i \u2265 k + 1, thus is commutative with both o(j) and e(j). Similarly, if j \u2264 k < l and\nk is odd, then e(k)\u22121 e(l) is commutative with both o(j) and e(j).\nIn the case of L-shaped curves, Couture\u2013Perron's method is summarized as the algorithm\nin Figure 7. By direct application of the algorithm to the L-shaped curve of type, we have:\n\nFigure 7: Couture-Perron's method in the case [3, 5; 3, 4] (\u03c0/2 rotated)\nClaim 1 [CP]\n\nThe L-shaped curve of type [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] presents the closure of the braid\n\uf8f1\u0010\n\u0011b1 \u0010\n\u0011b2 \u2212b1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 e(a2 )o(a2 )\nif a1 is odd,\ne(a1 )o(a1 )\nB[a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] := \u0010\n\u0011b1 \u0010\n\u0011b2 \u2212b1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 o(a2 )e(a2 )\nif a1 is even.\no(a1 )e(a1 )\n\nThe key idea of the rest of the proof is in Figure 8. Let G(n) be as follows.\n(\ne(n + 1)o(n)e(n \u2212 1)o(n \u2212 2)e(n \u2212 3) * * * e(4)o(3) if n is odd,\nG(n) :=\no(n + 1)e(n)o(n \u2212 1)e(n \u2212 2)o(n \u2212 3) * * * e(4)o(3) if n is even.\nIt is a product of some \u03c3i 's with i < n.\nClaim 2\nG(n \u2212 2)\u22121 e(n)o(n) G(n \u2212 2) = W (n)\n\u22121\n\nG(n \u2212 2)\n\no(n)e(n) G(n \u2212 2) = W (n)\n9\n\nif n is odd,\nif n is even.\n\n\fFigure 8: Braid of L-shaped curve [5, 9; 3, 5]\n\nIn fact, if n is odd, e(n \u2212 1)\u22121 e(n) = \u03c3n\u22121 and it commutes with o(n \u2212 2)\u22121 . Next,\no(n \u2212 2)\u22121 o(n) = \u03c3n\u22122 and it commutes with e(n \u2212 3)\u22121 . We repeat such reductions until o(3)\u22121 o(5) = \u03c33 inductively, and end with e(4)o(3) = \u03c32 \u03c31 . The other case is proved\nsimilarly.\nNext, we set H(a1 , a2 ) := \u03c1(G(a2 \u2212 a1 \u2212 1)), where \u03c1 is \u03c0-rotation in Definition 2.2. Then,\nH(a1 , a2 ) is a product of some \u03c3i 's with i > a1 + 1. Thus we have\nClaim 3 H(a1 , a2 ) commutes with e(a1 ), o(a1 ) and G(a1 \u2212 2).\nLet \u03a9(a1 , a2 ) := H(a1 , a2 )\u22121 G(a1 \u2212 2). By Claim 2 and 3, It holds\nClaim 4\n\u03a9(a1 , a2 )\u22121 e(a1 )o(a1 )\u03a9(a1 , a2 ) = W (a1 )\n\u22121\n\n\u03a9(a1 , a2 )\n\no(a1 )e(a1 )\u03a9(a1 , a2 ) = W (a1 )\n\nif a1 is odd,\nif a1 is even.\n\nThe following is the most troublesome step.\nClaim 5\n\u03a9(a1 , a2 )\u22121 e(a2 )o(a2 ) \u03a9(a1 , a2 ) = W (a1 )W (a2 )W (a1 )\u22121\n\u22121\n\n\u03a9(a1 , a2 )\n\n\u22121\n\no(a2 )e(a2 ) \u03a9(a1 , a2 ) = W (a1 )W (a2 )W (a1 )\n\nif a1 is odd,\nif a1 is even.\n\nTo prove Claim 5, we divide the braid of index a2 into two parts, lower and higher parts\nalong the a1 -th string. Here we denote a2 \u2212 a1 + 1 by a1 . In the case a1 is odd,\n(\ne(a1 )o(a1 ) \u03c1(e(a1 )o(a1 )) if a2 is odd,\ne(a2 )o(a2 ) =\ne(a1 )o(a1 ) \u03c1(o(a1 )e(a1 )) if a2 is even.\nIn the former case, by Claim 3, the conjugation of e(a2 )o(a2 ) by \u03a9(a1 , a2 ) is divided as the\nproduct of that of e(a1 )o(a1 ) by G(a1 \u2212 2) and that of \u03c1(e(a1 )o(a1 )) by H(a1 , a2 )\u22121 . Since\nH(a1 , a2 ) is defined as \u03c1(G(a1 \u2212 2)), it holds\nH(a1 , a2 ) \u03c1(e(a1 )o(a1 )) H(a1 , a2 )\u22121 = \u03c1(G(a1 \u2212 2)\u22121 e(a1 )o(a1 )G(a1 \u2212 2))\n= \u03c1(W (a1 ))\n= W (a2 )W (a1 )\u22121\nHere, we use Claim 2 with odd n = a1 . In the other cases, including a2 is even, the proofs\nare similar.\n10\n\n\fFinally, by Claim 1, 4 and 5,\n\u03a9(a1 , a2 )\u22121 B[a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] \u03a9(a1 , a2 ) = (W (a1 )W (a2 )W (a1 )\u22121 )b1 W (a1 )b2 \u2212b1\n= W (a1 )W (a2 )b1 W (a1 )\u22121 W (a1 )b2 \u2212b1\nIt is conjugate to W (a2 )b1 W (a1 )b2 \u2212b1 . The proof of Lemma 3.5 is complete. \u0003\nBy the symmetry between the L-shaped curve of type [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] and that of type\n[b1 , b2 ; a1 , a2 ], we have an extension of the well-known symmetry T (b, a) = T (a, b) of torus\nknots.\nCorollary 3.7 The closures of the braids\nW (b2 )a1 W (b1 )a2 \u2212a1 of index b2\n\nand W (a2 )b1 W (a1 )b2 \u2212b1 of index a2\n\ndefine the same link.\nLemma 3.8 Let a1 , a2 and c be positive integers with a1 < a2 , and \u03b4 be a sign (\u2208 {\u00b11}).\nThen, the knot of the closure of the braid of type W (a2 )\u00b1c W (a1 )\u03b4 of index a2 is presented as\na divide knot presented by an L-shaped curve, up to mirror image:\n(++) The knot W (a2 )c W (a1 ) is presented by the L-shaped curve [a1 , a2 ; c, c + 1].\n(+\u2212) The knot W (a2 )c W (a1 )\u22121 is presented by the L-shaped curve [a2 \u2212 a1 + 1, a2 ; c \u2212 1, c].\n(\u2212\u2212) The knot W (a2 )\u2212c W (a1 )\u22121 is the mirror image of the knot presented by the L-shaped\ncurve [a1 , a2 ; c, c + 1].\n(\u2212+) The knot W (a2 )\u2212c W (a1 ) is the mirror image of the knot presented by the L-shaped\ncurve [a2 \u2212 a1 + 1, a2 ; c \u2212 1, c].\nProof.\nThe case (++) in the lemma follows from Lemma 3.5 directly, and (+\u2212) follows\nfrom Lemma 2.3 and Lemma 3.5. The cases (\u2212\u2212) and (\u2212+) follow from (++) and (+\u2212)\nrespectively, since, if a knot K is the closure of the braid w, then the mirror image K! is that\nof the inverse w\u22121 , in general. \u0003\nBy Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 3.8, Theorem 1.2 is already proved: Up to mirror image, every\nBerge's knot of lens space surgery in Type III, IV, V and VI is one of A'Campo's divide knots,\nand can be presented by an L-shaped curve.\nWe end this section with referring the fiberedness of Berge's knots. By Theorem 1.2 and\nfiberedness of divide knots in Lemma 3.2(4), we can show\nCorollary 3.9 (Teragaito [Te], Ozsv\u00e1th\u2013Sz\u00e1bo[OSz])\nsurgery in Type III, IV, V and VI is fibered.\n\nEvery Berge's knot of lens space\n\nThis corollary can be proved by Lemma 2.1, 2.3 and the fact that knots presented by positive\n(or negative) braids are fibered [S]. In fact, Teragaito [Te] (see [HM, \u00a75.7]), has shown that\nevery Berge's knots (including Type VII, ..., XII, see Section 1) is fibered, by proving the\nbraid positivity. Ozsv\u00e1th\u2013Sz\u00e1bo [OSz, \u00a75] also proved fiberedness of every Berge's knot from\nanother view points.\n11\n\n\f4\n\nConstruction of L-shaped curves\n\nWe define the operation adding squares on L-shaped curves (via L-shaped regions), its drawing\nnotations, and explain how to construct the L-shaped curves PX(\u03b5, A, k, t) = X \u2229 LX(\u03b5, A, k, t)\nfor Berge's knots in Type X, given by the parameters (\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t). From now on, we consider\nonly L-shaped divide knots, i.e., the case that the L-shaped curve P (with the assumption (\u2217)\nin Section 3.2) is the image of an immersed arc (Lemma 3.2(1)).\n\n4.1\n\nAdding squares I\n\nWe start with the following:\nDefinition 4.1 For a positive integer n, we call the operation on L-shaped curves, changing\nfrom that of type [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] to [a1 , a2 + nb1 ; b1 , b2 ] or [a1 + nb2 , a2 + nb2 ; b1 , b2 ] adding n\nsquares, see examples in Figure 9. As a drawing notation, we specify the edge along which\nthe squares are added, and write n near the edge. By the symmetry in Corollary 3.7, we also\ncall the changing from [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] to [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 + na2 ] or [a1 , a2 ; b1 + na2 , b2 + na2 ] adding\nn squares.\n\nFigure 9: Adding squares I\n\nLemma 4.2 Adding n squares on an L-shaped curve P along an edge (of the region) corresponds to positive (i.e., right-handed) n full-twists on the divide knot L(P ) along the unknot\ndefined by the edge.\nThis lemma is proved by using the braid presentation in Lemma 3.5. Note that a full-twist is\nin the center of the braid group.\nAdding a square can be regarded as \"blow-down\", in the following sense. The coordinate\ntransformation (x, y) = (x, xt) (or = (yt, y)) is called a blow up in singularity theory, and\nis used for resolution of singularity of complex curves, see [HKK, p.16]. For example, for\na coprime positive integers (p, q) with p < q, the complex curve xq \u2212 y p = 0 becomes to\nxp (xq\u2212p \u2212 tp ) = 0 by the transformation. In this example, the link of the singularity at the\norigin changes from the torus knot T (p, q) to T (p, q \u2212p) and an unknot defined by the complex\nline t-axis (x = 0 in xt-plane) appears. The unknot is the axis of the full-twist. It corresponds\nto the Kirby calculus in the bottom figure in Figure 10, i.e., (\u22121)-framed unknot appears\nand the other components change by a left-handed full-twist along the unknot. Framings also\nchange by a certain formula. See [K, GS] for Kirby calculus.\n12\n\n\fFigure 10: Adding a square corresponds to a full-twist\n\nWe call its inverse operation, i.e., the transformation (x, y) = (x, y \u2032 /x) a blow down. (For\nexample, y 2 = x + \u01eb becomes y \u20322 = x2 (x + \u01eb), where both hand-sides are multiplied by x2 .)\nLet C be a real plane curve in xy-plane that intersects with y-axis transversely. By the\ntransformation, the all intersection points C and y-axis concentrate to the origin of xy \u2032 -plane,\nand the left half (x < 0) of C turns upside down along x-axis, see the first arrow in Figure 10.\nFor adding a square on an L-shaped curve along an edge of length l, we first blow down\nthe curve, where we take xy-coordinate such that y-axis is parallel and sufficiently close to the\nedge. After that, we perturb the curve near the multiple crossing at the origin, see the second\narrow in Figure 10. By using some \u2206-moves in Lemma 3.2(6), we can move the curve into the\nrequired L-shaped curve of the square added L-shaped region. The number of double points\nincreases by l(l \u2212 1)/2. For the Kirby calculus, see the bottom figure in Figure 10 again. By\nthe operation, the knot K changes by a right-handed full-twist along the unknot defined by\nthe edge. If K is framed (i.e., with a surgery coefficient), the framing increases by the square\nof the linking number of K and u. The linking number is equal to the length l of the edge by\nLemma 3.2(3).\n\n4.2\n\nAdding squares II\n\nWe can apply the operation adding squares twice successively by changing the edges, as in\nFigure 11. In the same figure, we also define a drawing notation. It is important which edge\nwe apply the operation first.\nHere, we state the effect of twice adding squares on the knots in S 3 . This is proved by\nLemma 4.2.\nLemma 4.3 Suppose that P = X \u2229 L be an L-shaped curve and the first edge e1 and the\nsecond one e2 of the region L are specified. By P \u2032\u2032 = X \u2229L\u2032\u2032 , we denote the resulting L-shaped\ncurve obtained by adding n1 squares along e1 first and adding n2 squares along e2 second,\nsuccessively. Then, the divide knot L(P \u2032\u2032 ) is equal to the knot K \u2032\u2032 obtained by two twistings\nfrom L(P ) in S 3 in the following sense:\nFirst, we take the three component divide link L(P \u222a c1 \u222a c2 ) = K \u222a L1 \u222a L2 presented by\nthe plane curve P \u222a c1 \u222a c2 , where L(P ) = K and Li is the component presented by slightly\n13\n\n\fFigure 11: Adding squares II\n\npushed off ci of ei (i = 1, 2) into L, see Figure 12. Note that L1 \u222a L2 is a Hopf link. Next, we\ntake n1 full-twists of K \u222a L2 along L1 . We call the resulting link K \u2032 \u222a L\u20322 . Finally, we take n2\nfull-twists of K \u2032 along L\u20322 . We call the resulting knot K \u2032\u2032 .\nIn Lemma 4.3, n1 , n2 are supposed to be positive, however, regarding the statement as construction of the knot K \u2032\u2032 from L(P ) by two twistings, it works also in the case n1 , n2 < 0.\nThe knot K \u2032\u2032 may be no longer a divide knot, by the obstruction of braid (quasi-)positivity\nof divide knots in Lemma 3.2(7) (and Lemma 3.5). In the next subsection, we consider the\ncase K \u2032\u2032 is the mirror image of an L-shaped divide knot.\n\n4.3\n\nAdding squares III\n\nWe extend the operation adding n squares into the case n < 0 partially, in analogy with\nLemma 4.3. It corresponds to negative (i.e., left-handed) |n| full-twists, and will be called\n\"adding negative squares\". We consider the case that the resulting knot of negative full-twists\nof an L-shaped divide knot is the mirror image of another L-shaped divide knot under some\nconditions.\nDefinition 4.4 (Adding negative squares in a certain case) Let L be an L-shaped region\nof type [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] with a specified edge e. We assume that the edge is the (bottom) one of\nlength a2 ,\nb2 = b1 + 1 and |n|a2 > b1 + 1.\nOnly under this condition, we define adding n squares with n < 0 along e as that the resulting\nregion is of type\n[a2 \u2212 a1 + 1, a2 ; |n|a2 \u2212 b1 \u2212 1, |n|a2 \u2212 b1 ].\nThis operation should be regarded geometrically as follows, see Figure 13: We assume that\nthe initial L-shaped region is at the origin as in Definition 3.3 (once forgetting the assumption\n14\n\n\fFigure 12: The effect of adding squares twice\n\nFigure 13: Adding negative squares\n\n(\u2217)) to explain the operation by using xy-coordinate. Then adding n squares with n < 0 is\ndefined as\n\u0002\n\u0003\ncl {(x, y)| 0 \u2264 x \u2264 a2 , 0 \u2264 y \u2264 |n|a2 } \\ L\n\u222a {(x, y)| a1 \u2212 1 \u2264 x \u2264 a1 , b1 \u2264 y \u2264 b1 + 1}.\n\nBy the finally added unit square at the concave point, if the concave point of the initial region\nis at an odd point, then that of the resulting region is also at an odd point, i.e., we can keep\nthe condition (\u2217).\nLemma 4.5 Under the condition of adding negative squares in Definition 4.4, adding n\nsquares with n < 0 on an L-shaped curve P along the edge corresponds to taking the mirror\nimage of n right-handed (i.e., |n| left-handed) full-twists on the divide knot L(P ) along the\nunknot defined by the edge.\nProof. By the operation, the type of L-shaped curves is changed from [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b1 + 1] to\n[a2 \u2212 a1 + 1, a2 ; |n|a2 \u2212 b1 \u2212 1, |n|a2 \u2212 b1 ]. By Lemma 3.5, the initial curve presents the closure\nof the braid W (a2 )b1 W (a1 ) of index a2 . The edge presents the braid axis in S 3 , The positive\nfull-twist is W (a2 )a2 in this situation, and is in the center of the braid group. The resulting\nknot of the n full-twists is the closure of W (a2 )b1 +na2 W (a1 ) = W (a2 )\u2212(|n|a2 \u2212b1 ) W (a1 ). Note\nthat |n|a2 > b1 + 1 is assumed. Lemma 4.5 follows from Lemma 3.8(\u2212+). \u0003\nExample 4.6 The example (from [3, 5; 3, 4] to [3, 5; 1, 2]) in Figure 13 shows that the mirror\nimage of T (2, 3) is obtained by P (\u22122, 3, 7) (in Example 3.6) by (\u22121) full-twist along the\n15\n\n\funknot defined by the bottom edge, whose linking number with P (\u22122, 3, 7) is \u00b15. Note that\nL-shaped curve of type [3, 5; 1, 2] is the same curve with the billiard curve B(2, 3) defined in\nLemma 3.1.\nQuestion 4.7 Extend the operation adding negative squares into (more) general cases.\n\n4.4\n\nHow to construct the L-shaped curve\n\nPreparation is complete. For each Berge's knot K = KX(\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t) in Type X, we take the\nL-shaped region L = L(\u03b5, A, k, t) in Table 2, where we used the drawing notation of adding\nsquares. Then, the plane curve P = X \u2229 L, as a divide, presents the knot K or its mirror\nimage. In fact, each L-shaped region in Table 2 is carefully constructed such that Berge's\nbraid presentation of the knot in Lemma 2.1 agrees with the braid presentation of the region\nin Lemma 3.8 under the suitable choice of \u03b4. The proof is in the next section.\nIn Table 2, we draw each L-shaped region in the case of the smallest A.\nDemonstration. KIII (\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t) for (\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t) = (1, 1, 2, 2, 1).\nBy Table 1(1), B = A(3 + 2k) \u2212 \u03b5 = 13, b = \u2212\u03b4\u03b5(2A + tB) = \u221217. By Lemma 2.1, it has a\nbraid presentation W (13)\u221217 W (3)1 . The surgery coefficient is bB + \u03b4A = \u2212219. On the other\nhand, according to Table 2, the L-shaped region L(\u03b5, A, k, t) with (\u03b5, A, k, t) = (1, 2, 2, 1) is\nthe L-shaped region of type [11, 13; 16, 17] (the region at the bottom in Figure 11), whose area\nis 219. By Lemma 3.5, its corresponding plane curve presents the closure of W (13)16 W (11).\nBy Lemma 2.3, the knot is equal to the closure of W (13)17 W (3)\u22121 , which is the mirror image\nof the required knot.\n\n5\n\nProof of Theorem 1.3 and 1.4\n\nTheorem 1.3 is proved by verifying that Berge's braid presentation of the knot (Lemma 2.1)\nand that of the L-shaped region in Table 2 (Lemma 3.8) agree, under the suitable choice of\nthe sign \u03b4 in each Type. In the proof below, we will also decide the choice of \u03b4 (depending on\nX and (\u03b5, A, k, t)). We denote the result by \u03b4X(\u03b5, A, k, t), or \u03b4X for short. It will be used in\nthe proof of Lemma 5.1\nProof. (of Theorem 1.3) Here, we prove Theorem 1.3 only in the case of Type III. The\nproofs in the other cases are similar.\nIn Type III, in Table 1(1) and (2), we find\na = 0,\n\nB = Al \u2212 \u03b5,\n\nl = 3 + 2k,\n\nb = \u2212\u03b4\u03b5(2A + tB).\n\nThus, Berge's braid presentation W (B)b W (A+1\u2212a)\u03b4 of the knot KIII (\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t) in Lemma 2.1\n([Bg2]) is\nW ((3 + 2k)A \u2212 \u03b5)\u2212\u03b4\u03b5(2A+tB) W (A + 1)\u03b4\n\n(1)\n\nFirst, we consider the case k = t = 0.\nCase 1+ (Type III, \u03b5 = 1, k = t = 0)\nIn Table 2, we find that the L-shaped region is of type [2A \u2212 1, 3A \u2212 1; 2A \u2212 1, 2A]. On\nthe other hand, Berge's presentation (1) is now W (3A \u2212 1)\u22122\u03b4A W (A + 1)\u03b4 . Here we choose\n\u03b4 = \u22121. We use Lemma 3.8(+\u2212) on the knot of W (3A \u2212 1)2A W (A + 1)\u22121 .\n16\n\n\fCase 1- (Type III, \u03b5 = \u22121, k = t = 0)\nIn Table 2, we find that the L-shaped region is of type [A + 1, 3A + 1; 2A, 2A + 1]. On the\nother hand, Berge's presentation (1) is now W (3A + 1)2\u03b4A W (A + 1)\u03b4 . We choose \u03b4 = 1. We\nuse Lemma 3.8(++).\nNext, we consider the case k > 0 (t = 0). In this case, we use the symmetry of Corollary 3.7\nto verify that the parameter k contributes as the k full-twists on the knots.\nCase 2+ (Type III, \u03b5 = 1, k > 0, t = 0)\nThe L-shaped region in Table 2 is of type [2A \u2212 1 + 2kA, 3A \u2212 1 + 2kA; 2A \u2212 1, 2A], which\npresents the closure of W (3A\u22121+2kA)2A\u22121 W (2A\u22121+2kA) by Lemma 3.5. By the symmetry\nof Corollary 3.7, it presents the same knot of\nW (2A)2A\u22121+2kA W (2A \u2212 1)A = (W (2A)2A )k W (2A)2A\u22121 W (2A \u2212 1)A .\nIts first part (W (2A)2A )k means k full-twists. On the other hand, Berge's presentation (1) is\nnow W (3A \u2212 1 + 2kA)\u22122\u03b4A W (A + 1)\u03b4 We choose \u03b4 = \u22121. We use Lemma 3.8(+\u2212).\nCase 2- (Type III, \u03b5 = \u22121, k > 0, t = 0)\nThe L-shaped region in Table 2 is of type [A + 1, 3A + 1 + 2kA; 2A, 2A + 1], which presents\nthe closure of W (3A + 1 + 2kA)2A W (A + 1) by Lemma 3.5. By Corollary 3.7, it presents the\nsame knot of\nW (2A + 1)A+1 W (2A)A+2kA = W (2A + 1)A+1 W (2A)A (W (2A)2A )k .\nIts final part (W (2A)2A )k means k full-twists of 2A strings of the braid of index 2A + 1. On\nthe other hand, Berge's presentation (1) is now W (3A + 1 + 2kA)2\u03b4A W (A + 1)\u03b4 by (1). We\nchoose \u03b4 = 1. We use Lemma 3.8(++).\nBefore we go into the case t 6= 0, we remark the followings.\n(1) The parameter t can be negative.\n(2) The parameters A, k and B are independent from t.\n(3) The parameter B is equal to the length of the edge that is added t squares.\n(4) In every case in Table 2, we can apply the operation adding t squares along the edge,\ni.e., the condition \"b2 = b1 + 1 and |t|a2 > b1 + 1\" for adding negative squares are\nsatisfied, even if t = \u22121.\nFrom now on, we use Berge's braid presentation of KIII (\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t) in Lemma 2.1 ([Bg2]) in\nthe form\nW (B)\u2212\u03b4\u03b5(2A+tB) W (A + 1)\u03b4 .\n\n(2)\n\nCase 3+ (Type III, \u03b5 = 1, t > 0)\nThe L-shaped region in Table 2 is of type [B\u2212A, B; 2A\u22121+tB, 2A+tB] with B = 3A\u22121+2kA.\nOn the other hand, Berge's presentation (2) is now W (B)\u2212\u03b4(2A+tB) W (A + 1)\u03b4 We choose\n\u03b4 = \u22121. We use Lemma 3.8(+\u2212).\nCase 3- (Type III, \u03b5 = \u22121, t > 0)\nThe L-shaped region in Table 2 is of type [A+1, B; 2A+tB, 2A+1+tB] with B = 3A+1+2kA.\n17\n\n\fOn the other hand, Berge's presentation (2) is now W (B)\u03b4(2A+tB) W (A+1)\u03b4 . We choose \u03b4 = 1.\nWe use Lemma 3.8(++).\nBefore we consider the case t < 0, we remark the condition 2A \u2264 B in Section 2. In fact,\n2A = B never occurs.\nCase 4+ (Type III, \u03b5 = 1, t < 0) We use adding negative squares.\nThe type of L-shaped region in Table 2 is [A + 1, B; |t|B \u2212 2A, |t|B \u2212 2A + 1] with B =\n3A \u2212 1 + 2kA. On the other hand, Berge's presentation (2) is now W (B)\u2212\u03b4(2A+tB) W (A + 1)\u03b4 .\nWe choose \u03b4 = 1. We use Lemma 3.8(++) on W (B)|t|B\u22122A W (A + 1).\nCase 4- (Type III, \u03b5 = \u22121, t < 0) We use adding negative squares.\nThe type of L-shaped region in Table 2 is [B \u2212 A, B; |t|B \u2212 2A \u2212 1, |t|B \u2212 2A] with B = 3A +\n1 + 2kA, which presents the closure of W (B)|t|B\u22122A\u22121 W (B \u2212 A). On the other hand, Berge's\npresentation (2) is now W (B)\u03b4(2A+tB) W (A + 1)\u03b4 We choose \u03b4 = \u22121. We use Lemma 3.8(+\u2212)\non the knot of W (B)|t|B\u22122A W (A + 1)\u22121 .\nAfter all, for given parameters (\u03b5, A, k, t), we have shown that the L-shaped curve P =\nX \u2229 L of the L-shaped region L = LIII (\u03b5, A, k, t) in Table 2 presents KIII (\u03b4, \u03b5, A, k, t) for\nsuitable choice of \u03b4.\nThe proof of Theorem 1.3 in the case of Type III is completed. The cases of the other\nTypes are proved by the same argument. \u0003\nIn the proof of Theorem 1.3, \u03b4III (\u03b5, A, k, t), the suitable choice of \u03b4 in Type III is determined. Considering the other Types, it extends as\n(\n\u22121 if \u03b5 * sgn(t) = +1\n,\n\u03b4X(\u03b5, A, k, t) =\n1\nif \u03b5 * sgn(t) = \u22121\nwhere sgn(t) = 1 if t > 0 or t = 0, sgn(t) = \u22121 otherwise. It means simply\n\u2212 \u03b4X * \u03b5 * sgn(t) = +1.\n\n(3)\n\nUsing \u03b4X, Theorem 1.3 means simply\nL( PX(\u03b5, A, k, t) ) = KX(\u03b4X, \u03b5, A, k, t).\nNow, we consider the coefficients of the lens space surgeries. Before we start the proof of\nTheorem 1.4, we show\nLemma 5.1 The surgery coefficient of L( PX(\u03b5, A, k, t) ) is positive.\nProof.\nAs in the proof of Theorem 1.3, here we prove the lemma only in the case of Type\nIII. In Table 1(3), we find that the coefficient of L( PIII (\u03b5, A, k, t) ) = KIII (\u03b4X, \u03b5, A, k, t) (as in\nType III) is\n\u2212\u03b4X * \u03b5 * (6A2 \u2212 3\u03b5A + k(2A)2 + tB 2 ).\nSince |B| = (3 + 2k)A \u2212 \u03b5 (the length of the longest edge), it holds that sgn(6A2 \u2212 3\u03b5A +\nk(2A)2 + tB 2 ) = sgn(t). Thus the sign of the coefficient is equal to \u2212\u03b4X * \u03b5 * sgn(t) = +1 by\n(3). The proof of the other Types are similar. \u0003\nQuestion 5.2 Prove Lemma 5.1 without Berge's braid presentation. If a knot K is a closure\nof a positive braid and admits a lens space surgery, is the coefficient positive?\n18\n\n\fNow, we prove a precise version of Theorem 1.4 on the difference between the area area(P )\nof the L-shaped curve and the surgery coefficient coef(L(P )) (> 0) of the lens space surgery\nas in Type X.\nLemma 5.3 Under the correspondence in Theorem 1.3, it holds that\n(\n0 if (\u22121)a * \u03b5 * sgn(t) = +1\n.\narea(P ) \u2212 coef(L(P )) =\n1 if (\u22121)a * \u03b5 * sgn(t) = \u22121\nwhere sgn(t) = 1 if t > 0 or t = 0, sgn(t) = \u22121 otherwise. See Table 1(1) for the definition of\na (= 0 or 1).\nProof.\nFirst, in the case k = t = 0, it is easy to verify the equation in Table 2. The\nparameters k and t with t > 0 contribute as adding positive squares. In the operation adding\na positive square along an edge of length x, the area increases by x2 . It is compatible with\nthe terms +kA2 + tB 2 (or +k(2A)2 + tB 2 ) in the surgery coefficients in Table 1(3). In the\ncase t < 0, we do the operation adding negative squares. Suppose that we get the curve Pnew\nfrom Pold by adding t squares with t < 0 along an edge of length x. Then\ncoef(L(Pnew )) = \u2212( coef(L(Pold )) \u2212 |t|x2 ),\nsince the new divide knot L(Pnew ) is the mirror image of the knot obtained by left-handed |t|\ntwists from L(Pold ). On the other hand,\narea(Pnew ) = |t|x2 \u2212 area(Pold ) + 1,\nwhere the last +1 corresponds to the finally added unit square. Thus\narea(Pnew ) \u2212 coef(L(Pnew )) = 1 \u2212 ( area(Pold ) \u2212 coef(L(Pold )) ).\nWe have the lemma. \u0003\nNote that Berge's constant a in [Bg2, Table 3(p.15)] was defined geometrically in the\ncontext of doubly-primitive knots. It might be curious that a is related to the difference\nbetween the area and the coefficient as above.\nGoda and Teragaito [GT] conjectured an inequality\n2g(K) + 8 \u2264 |r| \u2264 4g(K) \u2212 1,\non the surgery coefficient r and the genus g(K) of the hyperbolic lens space surgery (K, r). It\nis called \"Goda\u2013Teragaito conjecture\". We are concerned with the left hand-side inequality.\nBy Proposition 3.4 and Lemma 5.3, we have:\nCorollary 5.4 Let [a1 , a2 ; b1 , b2 ] be the type of the L-shaped curve of our presentation (in\nTable 2) of Berge's knot in Type III, IV, V and VI as a divide knot L(P ). Then, it holds that\ncoef(L(P )) \u2212 2g(L(P )) = a2 + b2 \u2212 1, or a2 + b2 \u2212 2.\nThe parameters A, k or |t| are greater, the difference |r| \u2212 2g(K) can be greater.\n19\n\n\f6\n\nFurther Observation\n\nDivide presentation of L-shaped divide knots helps us to study the constructions of the knots,\nand the relationship among the lens space surgeries.\n\n6.1\n\nTwisted torus knots\n\nFollowing Dean [D], by a twisted torus knot T (p, q; r, s), if r < p, we mean the knot obtained\nfrom the torus knot T (p, q) by s full-twists of r strings in the p parallel strings of T (p, q)\nin the standard position. On the other hand, if r > p, we mean the knot obtained from\nthe torus knot T (p, q) as a closure of the braid w(p, q)\u03c3p \u03c3p+1 * * * \u03c3r\u22121 by s full-twists of all r\nstrings, where w(p, q)\u03c3p \u03c3p+1 * * * \u03c3r\u22121 is a positive Markov stabilization of the standard braid\nw(p, q) of T (p, q) of index p to a braid of index r. The following lemma follows from the braid\npresentation in Lemma 3.5 (and Lemma 4.2).\nLemma 6.1 Let (p, q) be a coprime pair of positive integers, and r, s integers satisfying\n0 < r 6= p and s > 0. The twisted torus knot T (p, q; r, s) is one of A'Campo's divide knots,\nand can be presented by an L-shaped curve of type\n(\n[q, q + rs; r, p]\nif r < p\n,\n[rs + 1, q + rs; p, r] if r > p\nas A'Campo's divide knots, see Figure 14.\n\nFigure 14: Twisted torus knots T (p, q; r, s) (ex. T (4, 3; 3, 3) and T (4, 3; 5, 1))\nNote that, a twisted torus knot T (p, q; r, s) can be accidentally non-hyperbolic, a torus knot\nT (p\u2032 , q \u2032 ), or a cable knot C(T (p\u2032 , q \u2032 ); m\u2032 , n\u2032 ) of a torus knot, see [Y2, MY] for such phenomena.\nLemma 6.2 Each knot in the following list is a twisted torus knot:\n(knots with t = 0)\nKIII (1, \u22121, A, k, 0) = T (2A + 1, A + 1; 2A, k + 1),\nKIV (\u22121, 1, A, k, 0) = T (A, kA + (3A + 1)/2; A \u2212 1, 1),\nKV (\u22121, 1, A, k, 0) = T (A, (k + 1)A + 2; A \u2212 1, 1),\nKVI (1, \u22121, A, 0, 0) = T (A \u2212 1, A + 1; A, 1),\n(knots with t = \u22121)\nKIII (1, 1, A, k, \u22121)\n= T (A, A + 1; A \u2212 1, k + 2),\nKIV (\u22121, \u22121, A, k, \u22121) = T ((3A \u2212 1)/2, A; (3A + 1)/2, k + 1),\nKV (\u22121, \u22121, A, k, \u22121) = T (2A \u2212 2, A; 2A \u2212 1, k + 1).\n20\n\n\fProof.\nOnly we have to do is to verify them by comparing types of the L-shaped regions,\nthus we omit the proof in detail. See Figure 15 for the case of KV (\u22121, \u22121, A, k, \u22121), which\nneeds adding t square with t = \u22121. \u0003\n\nFigure 15: KV (\u22121, \u22121, A, k, \u22121) = T (2A \u2212 2, A; 2A \u2212 1, k + 1)\n\nNow, we count s full-twists along a fixed unknot as one twisting. If after s1 full-twists\nalong an unknot we take another s2 full-twists along a different unknot, then we count the\noperation as two twistings.\nCorollary 6.3 ([DMM]) Every knot in Berge's in Type III, IV, V and VI is obtained at\nmost one (s\u2032 ) full-twists from a twisted torus knot Tw := T (p, q; r, s), thus is obtained at most\ntwo twistings from a torus knot, such that every knot in the twisting process (T (p, q; r, i) with\n0 \u2264 i \u2264 s and j full-twists of Tw with 0 \u2264 j \u2264 s\u2032 ) admits lens space surgery. Furthermore, as\na twisted torus knot above, we can take T (p, q; r, s) that satisfies |r \u2212 p| = 1.\nIn the process of preparation of this paper, the author was informed by Motegi ([DMM]) that\nevery knot in Berge's list (including Type VII, ..., XII, see Section 1) is obtained by at most\ntwo twistings from a torus knot, which includes the above Corollary.\n\n6.2\n\nRelations between different Types\n\nSee the L-shaped region in the left top figure in Figure 16. It is of type [3, 5; 3, 4], and presents\nKIII (\u22121, 1, 2, 0, 0) (= P (\u22122, 3, 7)). The L-shaped regions obtained by adding k squares along\nthe right edge (denoted by R), we have a subsequence KIII (\u22121, 1, 2, k, 0) in Type III, see Type\nIII(\u03b5 = 1) in Table 2. On the other hand, those obtained by adding k + 1 squares with k \u2265 0\nalong the left edge (denoted by L), we have another subsequence KV (1, 1, 3, k, 0) in Type V\n(a different Type), see Type V(\u03b5 = \u22121) in Table 2. By\nKIII (\u22121, 1, 2, 0, 0) 7\u2192 KV (1, 1, 3, k, 0),\nwe denote such a relation, regarding it as KIII (\u22121, 1, 2, 0, 0) = \"KV (1, 1, 3, \u22121, 0)\". Using\nL-shaped curve presentation in Table 2, we can see such relations more:\n* For each A with A \u2265 3, KIII (\u22121, 1, A, 0, 0) 7\u2192 KIV (1, \u22121, 2A \u2212 1, k, 0).\n* For each A, KIII (1, \u22121, A, 0, 0) 7\u2192 KIV (\u22121, 1, 2A + 1, k, 0).\nQuestion 6.4 Find such relations more, especially in the case t 6= 0.\n\n21\n\n\fFigure 16: Type III and Type V\n\n6.3\n\nParameters Translation\n\nParameters of Berge's knots are different among some papers. In Table 1(4), we give the\ntranslation formula between\n(A, k) in [Bg2] and this paper\n\nand\n\n(n, p) in [Bg, Ba, Ba3, DMM].\n\nThe signs \u03b4, \u03b5 are commonly used among these papers.\nFor example, KIV (\u03b4, \u22121, 5, 1, t) (i.e., (\u03b5, A, k) = (\u22121, 5, 1)) in this paper is, up to mirror\nimage, obtained from the knot of (\u03b5, n, p) = (\u22121, 2, 4) in Type IV in [Bg, Ba, Ba3, DMM] by\n\u00b1t full-twists.\nThe parameter p is defined as a positive integer, and our k is just a parallel shift of p\nsuch that \"k = 0 at the minimal possible value as p\": the statement \"\u03b5p 6= \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1\" (see\nTable 1(4)) is referred as\n\"p \u2265 2 if \u03b5 = +1 and p \u2265 3 if \u03b5 = \u22121\"\n\nin [Bg, Ba, Ba3, DMM].\n\nOn the other hand, we say\n\"k := p \u2212 2 if \u03b5 = +1 and k := p \u2212 3 if \u03b5 = \u22121\",\n\nin the present paper.\n\nAcknowledgement.
