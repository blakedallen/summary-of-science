Introduction\nInelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) is a powerful experimental tool for\nidentifying and characterizing molecular species within the conduction region [1-17].\nStandard ac modulation techniques, along with two lock-in amplifiers, are utilized to measure\ncurrent-voltage ( I \u2212 V ) characteristics as well as the first and second harmonic signals\n(proportional to dI / dV and d 2 I / dV 2 , respectively). This method provides information on\nthe strength of the vibronic coupling between the charge carriers and nuclear motions of the\nmolecules. The IETS experiment can also be helpful in identifying the geometrical structures\nof molecules and molecule-metal contacts, since junctions with different geometries disclose\nvery different spectral profiles [16,17]. The measured spectra show well-resolved vibronic\nfeatures corresponding to certain vibrational normal modes of the molecules. It is also wellknown that the IETS spectra are very sensitive also to few other factors, such as: (i) the device\nworking temperature, (ii) the strength of the molecule-metal bonding, and (iii) the\nintramolecular conformational changes.\nIn the literature, we can distinguish two different approaches to the problem of\ninelastic transport. One of them is based on low order perturbative treatment, where the\ntunneling current is computed in the lowest order in the electron-phonon coupling [18-22].\nHowever, this approach is not fully consistent with the nonequilibrium conditions under\nwhich such measurements are done as well as with the boundary restrictions imposed by the\nPauli principle. The second mentioned method is associated with non-perturbative treatment,\nwhere the many-body electron-phonon interaction problem is transformed into a one-body\nmany-channel scattering problem within the so-called mapping technique [23-32]. It is\n\n1\n\n\fbelieved that this approximation is well-justified in the boundary case of the high voltages,\nwhile it does not involve any restrictions on the model parameters.\nThe main purpose of this work is to use non-perturbative method, based on Green's\nfunction theory and mapping technique (GFT-MT) [10-16], to study the effect of vibronic\ncoupling on the shape of transport characteristics (current-voltage and conductance-voltage)\nin the IETS experiments. We hypothetically divide the molecular device into three parts,\nwhere the central molecular bridge is isolated from two electrodes (source and drain) via\npotential barriers. Since the molecule is weakly connected to the electrodes, a molecule itself\nis treated as a quantum dot with discrete energy levels, while source and drain are described\nwithin a broad-band theory. Molecular vibrations are modelled as dispersionless (Einstein)\nphonon excitations which can locally interact with conduction electrons. The electrons\npassing through energetically accessible molecular states (conducting channels) may\nexchange a definite amount of energy with the nuclear degrees of freedom, resulting in an\ninelastic component to the electrical current. Such molecular oscillations can have essential\ninfluence on the shape of transport characteristics especially in the case, when the residence\ntime of a tunneling electron on a molecular bridge is of order of magnitude of the time\ninvolved in nuclear vibrations ( ~ ps ).\n\n2. Theory\nNow we briefly outline our theoretical approach. Let us write the full Hamiltonian of\nconsidered system as a sum:\nH=\n\n\u2211H\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n+ H M + HT ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere: \u03b1 = L for left (source) electrode and \u03b1 = R for right (drain) electrode, respectively, in\nthe case of two-terminal junction. Both metallic electrodes are treated as reservoirs for noninteracting electrons and described with the help of the following Hamiltonian:\nHL + HR =\n\n\u2211\u03b5\n\nk\n\nc k+ c k .\n\n(2)\n\nk\u2208\u03b1\n\nHere: \u03b5 k is the single particle energy of conduction electrons, while c k+ and c k denote the\nelectron creation and annihilation operators with momentum k in the \u03b1 electrode. The third\nterm describes molecular bridge with Holstein-type phonons:\n\nHM =\n\n\u2211 [\u03b5\n\ni\n\n]\n\n\u2212 \u03bb j (a j + a +j ) d i+ d i +\n\n\u2211\u03a9 a\nj\n\ni, j\n\n+\nj\n\naj ,\n\n(3)\n\nj\n\nHere: \u03b5 i is single energy level of molecular quantum dot, \u03a9 j is phonon energy in the j\nmode, \u03bb j is the strength of on-level electron-phonon interaction. Furthermore, d i+ and d i are\nelectron creation and annihilation operators on level i , while a +j and, a j are phonon creation\nand annihilation operators, respectively. The last term represents the coupling of molecular\nquantum dot to the electrodes:\n\nHT =\n\n\u2211 [\u03b3\n\n+\nk ,i k\n\n]\n\nc d i + h.c. ,\n\nk\u2208\u03b1 ;i\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere the matrix elements \u03b3 k ,i stands for the strength of the tunnel coupling between the dot\nand metallic electrodes.\nThe problem we are facing now is to solve a many-body problem with phonon\nemission and absorption when the electron tunnels through the dot. Let us consider for\ntransparency only one phonon mode (primary mode), since generalization to multi-phonon\ncase can be obtained straightforwardly. The electron states into the dot are expanded onto the\ndirect product states composed of single-electron states and m -phonon Fock states:\n(a + ) m\ni, m = d\n0 ,\nm!\n+\ni\n\n(5)\n\nwhere electron state i is accompanied by m phonons ( 0 denotes the vacuum state).\nSimilarly the electron states in the electrodes can be expanded onto the states:\nk , m = c k+\n\n(a + ) m\nm!\n\n0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the state k with momentum k is accompanied by m phonons. In this procedure, the\nnon-interacting single-mode electrodes (Eq.2) are mapped to a multi-channel model:\n~\n~\n(\u03b5 k\u03c3 + m\u03a9 ) k , m k , m .\nHL + HR =\n(7)\n\n\u2211\n\nk\u2208\u03b1 ; m\n\nSince the channel index m represents the phonon quanta excited in the reservoir, accessibility\nof particular conduction channels is determined by a weight factor:\nPm = [1 \u2212 exp(\u2212 \u03b2 \u03a9)]exp(\u2212m\u03b2\u03a9) .\n\n(8)\n\nHere Boltzmann distribution function is used to indicate the statistical probability of the\nphonon number state m at finite temperature \u03b8 , \u03b2 \u22121 = k B\u03b8 and k B is Boltzmann constant.\nSince we neglect nonequilibrium phonon effects and dissipative processes, the system\nconserves its total energy during the scattering process and therefore the electron energies are\nconstrained by the following energy conservation law:\n\n\u03b5 in + m\u03a9 = \u03b5 out + n\u03a9 .\n\n(9)\n\nMoreover, in practice, the basis set is truncated to a finite number of possible excitations\nm = mmax in the phonon modes because of the numerical efficiency. The size of the basis set\nstrongly depends on: (i) phonon energy, (ii) temperature in the reservoir under investigation\nand (iii) the strength of the electron-phonon coupling constant. In the new representation\n(Eq.5), molecular Hamiltonian (Eq.3) can be rewritten in the form:\n~\nH M = (\u03b5 i + m\u03a9 ) i, m i, m \u2212 \u03bb m + 1( i, m + 1 i, m + i, m i, m + 1 ) ,\n(10)\n\n\u2211\n\n\u2211\n\ni ,m\n\ni ,m\n\nwhich for each molecular energy level i is analogous to tight-binding model with different\nsite energies and site-to-site hopping integrals. Finally, the tunneling part can also be rewritten\nin terms of considered basis set as:\n~\nHT =\n\u03b3 km,i k , m i, m + h.c. ,\n(11)\n\n\u2211(\n\n)\n\nk\u2208\u03b1 ;i , m\n\n3\n\n\fwhere \u03b3 km,i is the coupling between the m th pseudochannel in the electrode and the molecular\nsystem, respectively. To avoid unnecessary complexities, in further analysis we take into\naccount molecular bridge which is represented by one electronic level \u2013 generalization to\nmultilevel system is simple.\n\nFigure 1: A schematic representation of inelastic scattering problem for the device composed\nof molecular quantum dot with single energy level connected to two reservoirs.\nNow we proceed to analyze the problem of electron transfer between two reservoirs of\ncharge carriers via molecular quantum dot in the presence of phonons. An electron entering\nfrom the left hand side can suffer inelastic collisions by absorbing or emitting phonons before\nentering the right electrode. Such processes are presented graphically in Fig.1, where\nindividual channels are indexed by the number of phonon quanta in the left m and right\nelectrode n , respectively. Each of the possible processes is described by its own transmission\nprobability, which can be written in the factorized form:\n2\n\nTm ,n (\u03b5 ) = \u0393L \u0393R G m +1,n +1 (\u03b5 ) .\n\n(12)\n\nSuch transmission function (Eq.12) is expressed in terms of the so-called linewidth functions\n\u0393\u03b1 ( \u03b1 = L, R ) and the matrix element of the Green's function defined as:\n\n[\n\n~\nG (\u03b5 ) = 1\u03b5 \u2212 H M \u2212 \u03a3 L \u2212 \u03a3 R\n\n]\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\n~\nHere: 1 stands for identity matrix, H M is the molecular Hamiltonian (Eq.10), while the effect\nof the electronic coupling to the electrodes is fully described by specifying self-energy\ncorrections \u03a3 \u03b1 .\nIn the present paper we adopt wide-band (WB) approximation to treat metallic\nelectrodes, where the hopping matrix element is independent of energy and bias voltage, i.e.\n\u03b3 km,i = \u03b3 \u03b1 . In this case, the self-energy is given through the relation:\n\ni\n\u03a3 \u03b1 = \u2212 \u0393\u03b1 ,\n2\n\n(14)\n\n\u0393\u03b1 = 2\u03c0 \u03b3 \u03b1 \u03c1 \u03b1 .\n\n(15)\n\nwhere\n2\n\nHere: \u03c1 \u03b1 is density of states in the \u03b1 -electrode. This self-energy function is mainly\nresponsible for level broadening and generally depends on: (i) the material that the electrode\nis made of, and (ii) the strength of the coupling with the electrode. There are few factors that\n\n4\n\n\fcan be crucial in determining the parameter of the coupling strength, such as: (i) the atomicscale contact geometry, (ii) the nature of the molecule-to-electrode coupling (chemisorption\nor physisorption), (iii) the molecule-to-electrode distance, or even (iv) the variation of the\nsurface properties due to adsorption of molecular monolayer. The consequences of WB\napproximation are: (i) negligence of the resonance shift due to the coupling with the\nelectrodes, (ii) the loss of the correct description of the contact and (iii) quantitative error of\norder 30 % in the magnitude of calculated current [33]. However, our essential conclusions\ncan be generalized well beyond this simplification. Both electrodes are also identified with\ntheir electrochemical potentials [34]:\n\n\u03bc L = \u03b5 F \u2212 \u03b7eV\nand\n\n(16)\n\n\u03bc R = \u03b5 F + (1 \u2212 \u03b7 )eV ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhich are related to the Fermi energy level \u03b5 F . The voltage division factor 0 \u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1\ndescribes how the electrostatic potential difference V is divided between two contacts and\ncan be related to the relative strength of the coupling with two electrodes: \u03b7 = 2 \u2212\u03b3 L / \u03b3 R . In our\nanalyses we can distinguish two boundary cases: \u03b3 L = \u03b3 R \u21d2 \u03b7 = 1 / 2 for interpretation of\nmechanically controllable break-junctions (MCB experiments) and \u03b3 L >> \u03b3 R \u21d2 \u03b7 \u2248 0 for\ninterpretation of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM experiments), respectively. Here we\nassume the symmetric coupling case, where \u03b7 = 1 / 2 . It should also be noted that the case of\nasymmetric coupling (\u03b7 \u2260 1 / 2 ) generates rectification effect [35].\nThe total current flowing through the junction can be expressed in terms of\ntransmission probability of the individual transitions Tm ,n which connects incoming channel\nm with outgoing channel n :\n+\u221e\n\nI tot (V ) =\n\nwhere:\n\n[\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)]\n\n2e\nd\u03b5 Tm ,n Pm f Lm 1 \u2212 f Rn \u2212 Pn f Rn 1 \u2212 f Lm ,\nh \u2212\u221e m ,n\n\n\u222b \u2211\n\nf \u03b1m = [exp[ \u03b2 (\u03b5 + m\u03c9 \u2212 \u03bc \u03b1 )] + 1]\n\n\u22121\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\nis the equilibrium Fermi distribution function. The factor of 2 in Eq.18 accounts for the two\nspin orientations of conduction electrons. The elastic contribution to the current is obtained\ncan be obtained from Eq.18 by imposing the constraint of elastic transitions, where \u03b5 in = \u03b5 out\nor more precisely m = n :\n+\u221e\n\nI el (V ) =\n\n2e\nd\u03b5\nh \u2212\u221e\n\n\u222b \u2211T\n\nm ,m\n\n[\n\n]\n\nPm f Lm \u2212 f Rm .\n\n(20)\n\nm\n\nThe differential conductance is then given by the derivative of the current with respect to\nvoltage: G (V ) = dI (V ) / dV .\n\n3. Results and discussion\nNow we proceed to consider one electronic level \u03b5 0 which is connected to two broad-band\nparamagnetic electrodes, where the electrons on the dot are coupled with the coupling\nstrength \u03bb to a single phonon mode with energy \u03a9 (primary mode). This is a test case simple\n5\n\n\fenough to analyze the essential physics of inelastic transport problem in detail. Besides,\ngeneralization to multilevel system with many different phonons can be obtained\nstraightforwardly. All of the key parameters can be inferred from different experimental data.\nThe width parameters \u0393L and \u0393R are related to observed lifetimes of excess electrons on\nmolecules adsorbed on metal surfaces and can be estimated from time-resolved two-photon\nphotoemission experiments to be in the range of 0.1-1 eV for chemisorbed species [36,37].\nThe electron-phonon coupling parameter \u03bb can be estimated in molecular systems from\nreorganization energies: E reorg \u2248 \u03bb2 / \u03a9 , inferred from electron-transfer rate studies in similar\nenvironments. Since observed values of E reorg are 0.1-1 eV and \u03a9 ~ 0.1 eV, the magnitude of\n\u03bb is placed in the range of 0.1-0.3 eV. Finally, we choose the maximum number of the\nallowed phonon quanta m max = 8 to obtain converged results for all the parameters involved\nin this paper.\n\nFigure 2: The current-voltage I (V ) = \u2212 I (\u2212V ) (a, b, c) and conductance-voltage\nG (V ) = G (\u2212V ) (d, e, f) characteristics for three different values of vibronic coupling\nparameters: \u03bb = 0.1 (a, d), \u03bb = 0.2 (b, e), and \u03bb = 0.3 (c, f). Total current (solid line) and its\nelastic part (dashed-dotted line) are compared with the current obtained in the absence of\nphonons (dashed line). The other parameters of the model (given in eV): \u03b5 0 = 0 , \u03b5 F = \u22121.3 ,\n\u03a9 = 0.13 , \u0393L = \u0393R = 0.1 , \u03b2 \u22121 = 0.025 .\n\n6\n\n\fThe dependence of the electrical current on bias voltage for three different values of\nthe \u03bb -parameter is illustrated in Figs.2a-c. Since molecular vibrations are observed with\nequal intensity in the positive and negative bias polarity, thus for clarity we only show the\npositive bias region in the spectrum. Here we can observe the general tendency: the stronger\nthe vibronic coupling, the smoother the I \u2212 V characteristic and the lower values of the\ncurrent flowing through the junction. The conductance-voltage ( G \u2212 V ) functions for three\ndifferent values of the \u03bb -parameter are demonstrated in Figs.2d-f. Here we can see that an\namount of the visible peaks strongly depends on the vibronic coupling. Generally, the stronger\nthe \u03bb -parameter, the more peaks involved and the longer voltage distance between them. It\ncan be deduced from the formula for polaron energies that the positions of the peaks in the\nconductance spectrum approximately coincide with the following expression:\n\uf8ee\n\u03bb2 m\u03a9 \uf8f9\nV \u2248 2 \uf8efV0 \u2212\n+\n\uf8fa,\ne\u03a9\ne \uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\n(21)\n\nwhere V0 =| \u03b5 F \u2212 \u03b5 0 | / e corresponds to the bias voltage for the case of non-phonon\nconductance peak. On the other hand, for the small values of \u03bb , we can not distinguish\nparticular peaks since they are merged into one misshapen peak. Because of this overlapping\nit could be difficult to determine the intrinsic line width of a single vibration mode.\n\nFigure 3: Maximum value of the current I max (a) and maximal height of the conductance peak\nGmax (b) are plotted against the vibronic coupling strength \u03bb . Total values of the current\n(black circles, solid line) are compared with its elastic part (grey circles, dashed line). The\nother parameters of the model are the same as in Fig.2.\nFurthermore, one of the most essential controversies in molecular electronics is\nassociated with the fact that the calculated currents for single-molecule devices is usually two\nor even three orders of magnitude overestimated in comparison with experimental data [38].\nIn Fig.3a we plot the maximal value of the current I max (calculated for V = 5 Volts) as a\nfunction of the vibronic coupling \u03bb . An increase of the \u03bb -parameter from 0 to 0.3 eV\nresults in reduction of the magnitude of the current flowing through the junction of about 40\n%, while its elastic contribution is suppressed of about 60 %. At the same time, the maximal\nheight of the conductance peak is reduced of about 75 %, while the suppression of its elastic\ncontribution is over 80 %, as documented in Fig.3b. So far, this divergence was closely\nconnected to some coupling effects, such as: (i) the atomic-scale contact geometry, (ii) the\nnature of molecule-metal coupling, or even (iii) the changes of surface properties due to\n\n7\n\n\fadsorption of molecular layers (during the preparation of the sample). However, here we show\nthat also the effect of inelastic tunneling due to polaron formation can reduce the current at\nthe molecular scale. Besides, it should be emphasized that temperature has no effect on the\nmaximum current and the maximal height of the conductance peak, affecting only the line\nwidths in the conductance spectrum.\n\nFigure 4: Conductance gap \u2206 as a function of vibronic coupling strength \u03bb . The other\nparameters of the model are the same as in Fig.2.\nAnother discrepancy is related to theoretical overestimation of the conductance gap\n( \u2206 ) due to state-of-art first-principles calculations in comparison with experimental data [38].\nFigure 4 presents the \u03bb -dependence of the \u2206 -parameter. With an increase of the vibronic\ncoupling strength from 0 to 0.3 eV, the conductance gap is reduced of about 35 % in relation\nto the initial value. This effect is a direct consequence of the so-called polaron shift in the\ndirection to lower voltages. The approximate formula for the conductance gap has the\nfollowing form:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03bb2 4\n\u2206 \u2248 4 \uf8efV0 \u2212\n\u2212 \u2212 \u0393L \u2212 \u0393R \uf8fa .\ne\u03a9 \u03b2\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n\n(22)\n\nIt should be mentioned that the \u2206 -parameter is mainly determined by the location of the\nFermi level with respect to the molecular electronic structure, while it is also influenced by:\n(i) the strength of the molecule-metal connections, and (ii) the temperature of the system\nunder investigation.\n\n4. Summary\nSummarizing, we have studied the effect of vibronic coupling on the shape of nonlinear\ntransport characteristics ( I \u2212 V and G \u2212 V ), using GFT-MT method. This non-perturbative\ncomputational scheme is entirely based on mapping which transforms the many-body\nelectron-phonon interaction problem into a one-body multichannel single-electron scattering\nproblem. Here we have shown that inelastic quantum transport through the molecule\nassociated with polaron formation can play a key role in justifying some well-known\ndiscrepancies between theoretical calculations and experimental results. However, it should\nbe stressed that the present method on few drastic approximations. For example, here we have\ncompletely ignored the following effects: (i) phase decoherence processes in the treatment of\n8\n\n\fthe electron-phonon exchange, (ii) Coulomb interactions between charge carriers, and (iii)\nphonon mediated electron-electron interactions.\nAnyway, inelastic transport is quite important for the structural stability [39] and the\nswitching possibility of the molecular electronic devices. Recently, the polaron formation on\nthe molecule was also suggested as a possible mechanism for generating the negative\ndifferential resistance (NDR effect) and hysteresis behaviour of the I \u2212 V dependence [40].\nMoreover, the problem of localized electron-phonon interactions is closely connected to the\nproblem of local heating in current carrying molecular junctions [41,42].\n\nReferences\n[1] R.C.
