The final state interaction in the detected at zero-near excitation energy pp-pair is described by the 1 S0\ncomponent of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude. Results of numerical calculations of\npolarization observables and differential cross-section persuade that, as in the non\nrelativistic case, this reaction can be utilized for a relativistic deuteron tensor polarimeter and as a source of information about the elementary nucleon-nucleon\ncharge exchange amplitude.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nNowadays large programs of experimental study of processes with polarized particles are\nin progress. The setups with deuteron targets (beams) occupy the leading place [1, 2, 3, 4].\nFor an investigation of the NN interaction in the deuteron at short distances the three\ndeuteron form factors, magnetic, electric and quadrupole, should be determined. In the\nelastic eD-scattering with unpolarized particles one can measure only two quantities, e.g.\nthe magnetic form factor and the deuteron function A(Q2 ), which is a kinematical combination of all three form factors. Even these two quantities provide important information\nabout the quark physics and dynamics at short distances (see, for instance recent measurements [1] at TJNAF). However, for a full determination of the deuteron form factors, one\nneeds measurements with polarized particles. For example, measurements of the tensor\nanalysing power T20 of recoil deuterons in elastic eD-scattering allow the determination of\nthe charge form factor Gc at high transferred momenta. The hadron-deuteron processes\n\n\fcan be considered as complementary tools in investigation of phenomena at short distances and also as a source of unique information unavailable in electromagnetic reactions\n(study of nucleon resonances, checking the non relativistic effective models, NN potentials etc.). Experimental and theoretical investigation of the proton-deuteron processes\nat intermediate and high energies has started some decades ago by studying elastic pD\nscattering [5], exclusive and inclusive break-up [6, 7]. In pD processes it is possible to\ncompletely restore the reaction amplitude by measuring a full set of polarization observables (see, e.g. [8, 9, 10]). Hence, as in the electromagnetic case one needs to measure\ndifferent polarizations of the recoil deuteron. Since polarization observables can be studied only by an additional secondary scattering of the reaction products (in polarimeter), it\nis obvious that second process must possess a high enough cross section to assure a good\nefficiency of the polarimeter. In ref. [11] Bugg and Wilkin have proposed as an effective\n~ \u2192 (pp)n where the final pp-pair is detected with\ndeuteron polarimeter the process pD\n\nextremely low excitation energy (see also ref. [12]). Later investigations [13, 11, 14, 15, 16]\nconfirmed the theoretical predictions and the charge exchange processes were suggested\nalso for use in investigation of a number of reactions with deuterons, e.g. pp \u2192 D\u03c0 + [17],\n~ D\n~ \u2032 )-reactions off heavy nuclei to study isoscalar transitions\nNN\u03c0-systems, inelastic (D,\n\u2206T = 0, \u2206S = 1 [18] etc. The direct consequence of these facts is that nowadays the interest in investigation of charge exchange processes does not abate. In our previous paper\n[19] we investigated the process pD \u2192 n(pp) within the impulse approximation. The goal\nof the present work is to consider theoretically the effects of the final state interaction\n\nin this reaction at relativistic initial energies (COSY, Dubna) and to confess whether in\nthis case the non relativistic predictions [11] hold and the reaction can be still regarded\nas a deuteron polarimeter tool. We propose a covariant generalization of the spectator\nmechanism [11] based on the Bethe-Salpeter formalism and on numerical solution of the\nBethe-Salpeter (BS) equation with a realistic one-boson exchange kernel [21, 22]. Here\nwe focus our attention in calculations of the cross section and the tensor analysing power\nT20 within the COSY kinematical conditions at, as in non relativistic case, zero vector\nanalyzing powers of the deuteron.\n\n2\n\nKinematics and the invariant amplitude\n\nWe select those processes which, in the deuteron center of mass system, correspond to\nfinal states with one fast neutron and a slowly moving proton-proton pair, i.e. reactions\n2\n\n\fof the type\n~ = n + (p1 + p2 ).\np+D\n\n(1)\n\nThe transferred momentum from the proton to the neutron is low, hence the main mechanism of the reaction can be described as a charge exchange process of the incoming proton\noff the internal neutron whereas the proton in the deuteron remains merely as a spectator.\nIf so, then the resulting pp-pair will be detected with low total and relative momenta. In\nFig. 1 the diagram of such processes is schematically depicted. The following notations\nare adopted: p = (Ep , p) and n = (En , n) are the 4-momenta of the incoming proton\nand outgoing neutron, P \u2032 is the total 4-momentum of the pp-pair, which is a sum of the\ncorresponding 4-momenta of detected protons, p1 = (E1 , p1 ), p2 = (E2 , p2 ): P \u2032 = p1 + p2 .\nThe notion of the invariant mass of the pair sf , sf = P \u20322 = (2m + Ex )2 , where m stands\nfor the nucleon mass and Ex for the excitation energy of the pair, is also explored in\nwhat follows. The excitation energy Ex ranges from zero to few MeV , Ex \u223c 0 \u2212 8 MeV .\n\nAt such low values of Ex the main contribution to the final state of the pp pair in the\n\ncontinuum comes from the the 1 S0 -configuration [15]. The differential cross section for\nthe reaction (1) reads [19]:\n2\n\n1\n1\nd\u03c3\n=\ndt dsf\n2 64\u03c0\u03bb(p, D)\n\nv\nu\nu\nt1 \u2212\n\n4m2 1\n|Mf i |2 .\nsf (2\u03c0)2\n\n(2)\n\nThe experimental data from Saclay [16] are binned into the following intervals of excitation\nenergy:\nI:\n\n0 \u2264 Ex \u2264 1 MeV,\n\nII :\n\n1 MeV \u2264 Ex \u2264 4 MeV,\n\nIII :\n\n4 MeV \u2264 Ex \u2264 8 MeV.\n\nTo compare the cross section (2) with the experimental data it is necessary to integrate\nover the invariant mass of the pair in the regions I, II and III according to\nd\u03c3\ndt\n\n!\n\nI,II,III\n\n1\n=\n(8\u03c0)3 \u03bb\n\nZ\n\ndsp\n\nI,II,III\n\nv\nu\nu\nt1 \u2212\n\n4m2\n|Mf i |2 .\nsf\n\n(3)\n\nBy using the Mandelstam technique [23] the covariant matrix element corresponding to\nthe diagram on Fig. 1 can be written in the form\nTrM\n=\n\u2032r\n\nX\nss\u2032\n\n1\n(2m)2\n\nZ\n\nd4 k fr\u2032 s\u2032 ,sr \u00d7\n\n\u00d7 \u016bs (pn )\u03a8M (k) (\n\nq\nD\u0302\n\u2032\n\u2212 k\u0302 + m)\u03a8\u0304P \u2032 (k \u2212 ) us (pp ).\n2\n2\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fThe elementary charge-exchange amplitude Ace is incorporated in the matrix element (4)\n\nby the on-shell amplitudes fr\u2032 s\u2032 ,sr and the Dirac spinors. In doing so the off-shell effects\n\nare neglected and the elementary subprocess is considered as real process with on-shell\nparticles. In our numerical calculations we use the helicity amplitudes of pn scattering,\nresulting from both the Nijmegen partial wave analysis [28, 26] and the well-known results\nof SAID [27]. For the final 1 S0 -state within the \u03c1-classification the BS amplitude \u03a8\u0304P \u2032 in\nthe center of mass of the NN pair is represented by four partial amplitudes 1 S0++ , 1 S0\u2212\u2212 ,\n3\n\nP0+\u2212 and 3 P0\u2212+ [24], which for the sake of brevity are denoted as \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c64. The partial\n\namplitudes \u03c6i may be found from the BS equation, which, in the simplest case of pseudo\nscalar exchanges reads as\n\u03a8\u0304P \u2032 (p) =\n\n\u03a8\u03040P \u2032 (p)\n\n+\n\n2\nig\u03c0N\nN\n\nZ\n\nd 4 p\u2032\n\u2206(p \u2212 p\u2032 )S\u0303(p2 )\u03b35 \u03a8\u0304P \u2032 (p\u2032 )\u03b35 S(p1 ),\n4\n(2\u03c0)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u2206 and S are the scalar and spinor propagators, respectively, S\u0303 \u2261 UC S UC\u22121 , and\n\u03a8\u03040P \u2032 (p) is the free amplitude corresponding to two non interacting nucleons (the relativistic\n\nplane wave). The solution of eq. (5) may be presented as a Neuman-like series, the first\nterm of which is the free term from eq. (5):\n\u03a8\u0304P \u2032 (p) = \u03a8\u03040P \u2032 (p) + \u03a8\u0304iP \u2032 (p).\n\n(6)\n\nThe second part in eq. (6) is entirely determined by the interaction and may be symbolically referred to as scattered wave. To determine the scattered wave in eq. (6) it is\nnecessary to solve the BS equation of the type (5). Solving the BS equation in the continuum is a much more cumbersome procedure than, e.g. for the homogenous equation.\nBesides difficulties encountered in solving the latter (singularities of amplitudes, poles in\npropagators, cuts etc.) the former even does not allow the Wick rotation [25] to the Euclidian space, and in the Minkowsky space there are no rigourous mathematical methods\nof finding solutions 1 . However, an approximate solution of eq. (5) may be obtained by\napplying the so-called \"one-iteration approximation\" [10]. Within that one may obtain a\nrather good estimate of the interaction term.\n\n3\n\nThe one-iteration approximation\n\nFor a consistent relativistic analysis of the reaction (1) one should solve the BS equation\nfor both bound state and scattering state with the same interaction kernel. We have\n1\n\nActually there is one realistic solution of the inhomogeneous BS equation in the ladder approximation,\n\nobtained by Tjon [20].\n\n4\n\n\ffound a numerical solution for the deuteron bound state with a realistic one-boson exchange potential [21]. The Bete-Salpeter equation, after a partial decomposition, has been\nsolved numerically by using an iteration method. We found that the iteration procedure\nconverges rather quickly if the trial function is properly chosen. In such case even after\nthe first iteration the BS solution coincides with the exact one up to relative momentum\np \u223c 0.6 \u2212 0.7 GeV /c. This circumstance becomes useful if one needs an approximate so-\n\nlution of the BS equation at not too large momenta p \u2264 0.5 \u2212 0.7 GeV /c. This is just our\n\ncase, since in reaction (1) the relative momentum of the pp-pair is expected to be rather\nsmall and the scattering part of the amplitude (6) can be obtained from the equation\n(5) by one iteration. To solve eq. (5) we proceed as follows (see also ref. [10]): i) for\nsimplicity, in the inhomogeneous BS equation we leave only the pseudo scalar isovector\nexchanges (\u03c0-mesons) ii) by disregarding the dependence upon p0 in the meson propagator in eq. (5) and then using the standard representation of propagators via generalized\nLegandre polynomials Ql , one obtains for the main partial amplitude\n\u03c61S ++ (p0 , |p|) = \u03c601S ++ (p0 , |p|) \u2212\n0\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n1\ng\u03c0N\nN\n\u00d7\n\u0010 \u221as\n\u00112\nf\n2\n4\u03c0\n\u2212\nE\n\u2212\np\np\n0\n2\n\ni\nd|p\u2032 | |p\u2032 | 1 h\n(Ep Ep\u2032 \u2212 m2 )Q0 (\u1ef9\u03bc ) \u2212 |p||p\u2032 |Q1 (\u1ef9\u03bc ) u1S0 (sf , |p\u2032 |),\n2\u03c0 |p| Ep Ep\u2032\n\n(7)\n\n\u2032\n\np2 + p 2 + \u03bc2\n. In obtaining (7) the integration over p\u20320 has been carried out\nwhere \u1ef9\u03bc =\n\u2032|\n2|p||p\u221a\nsf\nin the residium p\u03030 =\n\u2212 Ep\u2032 and, by definition, the BS wave function in the continuum\n2\nis\ng1S ++ (p\u03030 , |p\u2032 |)\nu1S0 (sf , |p |) = \u221a0\n,\nsf \u2212 2Ep\u2032\n\u2032\n\n(8)\n\nwhere g1S ++ is the vertex function (for more details see [10, 24]). Now if we restrict ourself\n0\n\nto only one iteration in (7) and take the trial function (8) as a non relativistic solution of\nR\n\u2032\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation, e.g. the Paris wave function uN\n1 S (sf , |p |), the BS amplitude is\n0\n\nobtained by formula\n\nGo.i.

(9) and (10) one may easily find the non relativistic analogue of the\nobtained formulae. So, the free term in eq. (9) together with the first term in eq. (10)\nreflect the non relativistic equation for the 1 S0 wave function, while the second term in\n(10) turns out to be corrections of pure relativistic origin.\n\n4\n\nNumerical results\n\nIn Figs. 2 and 3 we present the results of numerical calculations of the cross section\nd\u03c3\nand tensor analysing power T20 . The elementary charge exchange amplitude has\ndt\nR\nbeen taken from ref. [29] and the non relativistic trial function uN\n1 S (r) is the solution of\n0\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the Paris potential [30]. The Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes\nare those from the numerical solution [21] obtained with a realistic one-boson exchange\ninteraction. The dashed lines in Figs. 2 and 3 correspond to results within the relativistic\nimpulse approximation [19], while the solid lines denote results with taking into account\nthe final state interaction in one-iteration approximation (as it is described above). It is\nseen that in all three energy bins the agreement with data for the cross section is essentially\nimproved. Especially it concerns the range 1 \u2264 Ex \u2264 4. For the energy bin close to zero\n\nthere is still a disagreement with data at low transferred momenta which, probably may\nbe addressed to the fact that in our calculations we have not taken into account the\nCoulomb interaction in the pp-pair. For higher excitation energies (Ex \u223c 8 MeV ), other\n\npartial waves (e.g. triplet state ) in the pp-final state contribute and, within the adopted\n\nassumptions one may expect only qualitative agreement with data. From the Fig. 2 one\nmay conclude that at low excitation energies the supposed mechanism for the reaction (1)\n(charge exchange subprocess with interaction in 1 S0 state of the pp-pair in the continuum)\nseems to be correct. Moreover, from a comparison of the left and right panels in Fig. 2 one\nmay expect that for the higher initial energy there is larger kinematical region where the\nmechanism holds. Figure 3 demonstrates that the tensor analysing power is less sensitive\nto final state interaction effects. As a matter of fact, the tensor analysing power, being\na ratio of non diagonal products of partial amplitudes to the diagonal ones, serves as a\nmeasure of the quality of parametrization of partial amplitudes and their mutual relative\nphases. This has been pointed out in a series of publications (see e.g. refs.[6, 10]), where\na good simultaneous description of cross sections and T20 in reactions of the deuteron\n6\n\n\fbreak-up or elastic scattering from protons, is still lucking. Nevertheless, since in the\nprocess (1) the behaviour of the partial amplitudes is mostly governed by the elementary\ncharge exchange ones, an experimental investigation of the tensor analysing power T20\nin reactions of the type (1) can essentially supplement data on the NN charge exchange\namplitudes at high energies. In Figs. 4 and 5 we present the predicted cross section and\ntensor analysing power at high energies (COSY, Dubna). It is immediately seen that the\ncross section is substantially decreasing with the energy increasing, nevertheless remains\nlarge enough to be experimentally investigated. Another peculiarity of the studied process\nat relativistic energies is that the tensor analysing power T20 does not change the sign\nremaining positive in a large kinematical region, in contrast to the lower energies (cf. Fig.\n3). Note again, that in the above calculations the vector analyzing power of the deuteron\nis strictly zero.\nFrom the performed analysis one can conclude that there is a kinematical region for\nthe excitation energy, Ex < 5 MeV , and transferred momentum, |q| \u2264 0.3 \u00f7 0.4 GeV /c\n(the COSY [4] kinematics), for which the mechanism of the reaction (1) is fairly well\n\ndescribed within the spectator approach by an elementary pn charge exchange subprocess,\nfor active nucleons, with detection of the pp-pair in the 1 S0 final state. Our covariant\napproach agrees with previous non relativistic calculations and allows predictions of the\ncross sections and polarization observables at intermediate and relativistic energies, in\nparticular, for kinematical conditions achievable at COSY. The predicted cross sections\nand tensor analysing power T20 are large enough for the process (1) to be used, in a large\nrange of initial energies, for the determination of properties of polarized deuteron, provided\nexperimentally one simultaneously detects vanishing vector polarization of deuterons.\n\n5\n\nSummary\n\n~\nIn summary, the performed covariant analysis of the reactions D(p,\nn)pp with two protons\nin the 1 S0 final state allows to conclude that, as in the non relativistic limit, such process\ncan be used as an effective deuteron polarimeter also at relativistic energies, achieved at\nCOSY and Dubna. The effects of final state interaction are found to be substantial and\nessentially improve the agreement with data.\n\n7\n\n\f6\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was performed in parts during the visits of S.S.S and L.P.K. in the Forschungszentrum Rossendorf, Institute of Nuclear and Hadron Physics.
