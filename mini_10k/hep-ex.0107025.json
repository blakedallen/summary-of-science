We use a sample of\n22.72 \u00b1 0.36 million BB events collected between October 1999 and October 2000 with the\nBABAR detector at the PEP-II storage rings at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The\ncharmonium mesons considered here are J/\u03c8 , \u03c8(2S), and \u03c7c1 , and the light meson in the decay\nis either a K, K \u2217 , or \u03c0 0 .\nPACS numbers: 11.30.Er, 13.25.Hw\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDecays of B mesons to two-body final states containing\na charmonium resonance (J/\u03c8 , \u03c8(2S), \u03c7c1 ) constitute\na very sensitive laboratory for the study of electroweak\ntransitions, as well as the dynamics of strong interactions\nin heavy meson systems. In particular, neutral B decays\nto these final states are expected to exhibit a significant\nCP asymmetry, the magnitude of which is cleanly related\nto standard model parameters [1].\nThe tree level and leading penguin diagrams for the\ndecay modes we consider are shown in Fig. 1. Due to\nthe contributions of non-perturbative QCD interactions\nin the final state, assumptions must be made in estimating the expected branching fractions of these modes, and\ntherefore these estimates have some degree of model dependence. A number of such estimates have appeared in\nthe literature [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The one\nmodel-independent element common to all of these predictions is the requirement from isospin symmetry that\nthe ratio of the charged to neutral partial widths should\nbe unity, and that this should hold separately for each\nlight meson accompanying the charmonium meson in the\nfinal state.\nHere we report the measurement of branching fractions\nof B mesons to a charmonium resonance accompanied by\na kaon or \u03c0 0 meson. The channels measured are listed\nin Table I. Here and throughout this paper for each final\nstate mentioned its charged conjugate is also implied. We\nreconstruct J/\u03c8 decays to lepton pairs l+ l\u2212 , where l is\neither an electron or muon.\nOur large data sample permits a measurement of these\nbranching fractions with a precision superior to previous\nexperiments. The simultaneous measurement of a number of final states allows us to determine ratios such as\nvector to pseudoscalar kaon and heavy to light charmonium states production. Many systematic errors cancel\nwhen these ratios are extracted from a single data set using very similar event selection criteria, further increasing\nthe usefulness of our results for the validation or development of phenomenological models.\nAnother highly relevant input for the understanding of\nstrong interactions in B decays is the measurement of po-\n\n\u2217 Also\n\nwith Universit\u00e0 di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.\n\u2020 Also with Universit\u00e0 della Basilicata, Potenza, Italy.\n\n(a)\n\nc\nc\ns,d\n\nb\nW-\n\nB0, B-\n\nJ/\u03c8, \u03c8(2S), \u03c7c1\nK, K*, \u03c00\n\nd, u\n(b)\n\ng\n\nu,c,t\n\ns,d\n\nb\n0\n\n-\n\nB ,B\n\nc\nc J/\u03c8, \u03c8(2S), \u03c7c1\n\nW\n\n-\n\nK, K*, \u03c00\n\nd, u\nFIG. 1: Leading Feynman diagrams for the decays we consider.\n\nlarization in vector-vector final states, which is reported\nin another publication [13].

At PEP-II, 9.0 GeV electrons collide with\n3.1 GeV positrons to produce a center-of-mass energy of\n10.58 GeV, the mass of the \u03a5 (4S) resonance.\nThe BABAR detector is described elsewhere [15]; here\nwe give only a brief overview. Surrounding the interaction point is a 5-layer double-sided silicon vertex tracker\n(SVT) which gives precision spatial information for all\ncharged particles, and also measures their energy loss\n(dE/dx). The SVT is the primary detection device for\nlow momentum charged particles. Outside the SVT, a\n40-layer drift chamber (DCH) provides measurements of\nthe transverse momenta pT of charged particles with respect to the beam direction. The resolution of the pT\nmeasurement for tracks with momenta above 1 GeV/c is\nparameterized as:\n\u03c3(pT )\n= 0.13pT ( GeV/c)% + 0.45%.\npT\n\n(1)\n\n\f6\nTABLE I: Branching fractions and decay modes considered in\nthis paper.

Beyond the outer radius of the DCH is a detector\nof internally reflected Cherenkov radiation (DIRC) which\nis used primarily for charged hadron identification. The\ndetector consists of quartz bars in which Cherenkov light\nis produced as relativistic charged particles traverse the\nmaterial. The light is internally reflected along the length\nof the bar into a water-filled stand-off box mounted on\nthe rear of the detector. The Cherenkov rings expand\nin the stand-off box and are measured with an array\nof photomultiplier tubes mounted on its outer surface.\nA CsI(Tl) crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) is\nused to detect photons and neutral hadrons, as well as\nto identify electrons. The resolution of the calorimeter is\nparameterized as:\n\u03c3(E)\n2.3%\n=\n1 \u2295 1.9%.\nE\n(E( GeV)) 4\n\n(2)\n\nThe EMC is surrounded by a superconducting solenoid\nthat produces a 1.5-T magnetic field. The instrumented\nflux return (IFR) consists of multiple layers of resistive\nplate chambers (RPC) interleaved with the flux return\niron. In addition to the planar RPC layers in the flux\nreturn, there is an additional cylindrical layer just outside\nof the EMC. The IFR is used in the identification of\nmuons and neutral hadrons.\nData acquisition is triggered with a two-level system.\nThe first level (Level 1) monitors trigger information from\nthe DCH and EMC, and generates a trigger upon detection of track or cluster candidates. The second level\n(Level 3) retains events in which the track candidates\npoint back to the beam interaction region (L3 DCH trigger), or EMC clusters candidates remain after the suppression of hits which have less energy than a minimum\nionizing particle or are uncorrelated in time with the rest\nof the event (L3 EMC trigger). Over 99.9% of BB events\npass either the L3 DCH or L3 EMC trigger. A fraction of\nall events that pass the Level 1 trigger are passed through\n\nLevel 3 to allow monitoring of the Level 3 trigger performance.\nIII.\n\nDATA SAMPLE\n\nThe data used in these analyses were collected between\nOctober 1999 and October 2000 and correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 20.7 fb\u22121 taken on the \u03a5 (4S)\nand 2.6 fb\u22121 taken off-resonance at an energy 0.04 GeV\nlower than the peak, which is below the threshold for BB\nproduction. The data set contains 22.72 \u00b1 0.36 million\nBB events.\nIV.\n\nCOORDINATE SYSTEM AND REFERENCE\nFRAMES\n\nWe use a right-handed coordinate system with the z\naxis along the electron beam direction and y axis upwards, with origin at the nominal beam interaction point.\nUnless otherwise stated, kinematic quantities are calculated in the rest frame of the detector. The other reference frame we commonly use is the center of mass of the\ncolliding electrons and positrons, which we will call the\ncenter-of-mass frame.\nV.\n\nPARTICLE RECONSTRUCTION\n\nThe reconstruction of exclusive B decays begins with\nidentifying candidates for the decay products. Charged\nparticles are reconstructed as tracks in the SVT and/or\nDCH. Leptons and kaons are identified with information\nfrom the DCH, the EMC (for electrons) the IFR (for\nmuons), and the DIRC (for kaons). Photons are identified based on their energy deposition in the EMC, and\nKL0 are identified from either energy deposition in the\nEMC or a shower in the IFR.\nA.\n\nTrack Selection\n\nIn general, tracks used in this analysis are required to\ninclude at least 12 DCH hits to ensure that their momenta and dE/dx are well measured. In addition, tracks\nare required to have pT > 100 MeV/c, and to point back\nto the nominal interaction point within 1.5 cm in xy and\n3 cm in z. Roughly 95% of the solid angle about the\ninteraction point in the center-of-mass frame is covered\nby 12 or more DCH layers.\nWe make exceptions to this requirement for two\ntypes of particles: pions from KS0 , which do not originate at the nominal interaction point, and pions from\n\u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , which frequently do not have sufficient transverse momenta to traverse 12 layers of the\nDCH. Any track found in the DCH or SVT is used in\nreconstructing these particles.\n\n\f7\nTABLE II: Summary of electron identification criteria. Variables used are: dE/dx, the energy loss measured in the DCH;\nE/p, the ratio of the EMC cluster energy to the momentum measured in the tracking spectrometer; Ncrys , the number of EMC\ncrystals forming the cluster; LAT, the lateral energy distribution [16] of the EMC cluster; A42 , one of the Zernike moments\n[17] of the EMC cluster; and \u03b8C , the Cherenkov angle measured in the DIRC.

The distribution of energy among the crystals is used to discriminate between\nclusters arising from electromagnetic and hadronic showers. The variables used to describe this distribution are\nthe lateral energy (LAT) [16] and the Zernike moments\nAmn [17]. LAT is a measure of the radial energy profile of the cluster; the Zernike moment A42 measures the\nasymmetry of the cluster about its maximum. Electromagnetic showers have LAT peaked at about 0.25 and\nA42 close to zero, while showers from hadrons have a\nbroader distribution in LAT, and extend to larger values\nof A42 .\n\nC.\n\nPhoton Candidate Selection\n\nPhotons are identified as EMC clusters that do not\nhave a spatial match with a charged track, and that have\na minimum energy of 30 MeV. To reject clusters arising\nfrom noise hits, LAT is required to be less than 0.8.\nD.\n\nElectron and Muon Identification\n\nWe derive substantial background rejection from the\npositive identification of electrons and muons within the\nsample of charged tracks. For electrons, the variables\nthat distinguish signal from background include LAT and\nA42 , the ratio of energy measured in the EMC to momentum measured in the tracking spectrometer (E/p),\n\n\f8\ndE/dx measured in the DCH, and the Cherenkov angle\n\u03b8C measured in the DIRC.\nFor identifying muons, the presence of an energy deposition consistent with a minimum ionizing particle in the\nEMC, and the details of the distribution of hits in the\nIFR are used. In particular, the number of interaction\nlengths traversed in the IFR N\u03bb must be consistent with\nexpectations for a muon, both the average and variance\nof the number of hits per layer must be small, and the\nfit of a track to the hits must have low \u03c72 , both within\nthe IFR (\u03c72IFR ) and in the match between the IFR and\ncentral detector track (\u03c72match ).\nSince the optimal tradeoff between efficient selection\nand suppression of backgrounds varies between decay\nmodes, there are several sets of criteria used to select\nleptons. These are defined in Table II for electrons\nand Table III for muons. In addition to these criteria,\nwe also restrict the lepton selection to a fiducial region\nwithin which the efficiency is well-known from control\nsamples, and the material in the detector is accurately\nmodelled in the Monte Carlo. The accepted range in polar angle \u03b8 is 0.410 < \u03b8 < 2.409 rad for electrons and\n0.30 < \u03b8 < 2.70 rad for muons. This corresponds to a\ncoverage of 84% of the solid angle in the center-of-mass\nframe for electrons, and 92% for muons.\nTo increase the efficiency of the event selection, electron candidate tracks are combined with photon candidates to recover some of the energy lost through\nbremsstrahlung. In addition to the photon selection criteria listed above, photons used in bremsstrahlung recovery are required to have A42 < 0.25. They are also\nrequired to be within 35 mrad in \u03b8 from the track, and\nto have azimuthal angle \u03c6 intermediate between the initial track direction and the centroid of the EMC cluster\narising from the track. The initial track direction is estimated by subtracting 50 mrad opposite to the bend\ndirection from the \u03c6 of the fitted track measured at the\norigin. The procedure increases the efficiency for reconstructing charmonium decays to e+ e\u2212 by about 30%.\nE.\n\n0\n\nKL Candidate Selection\n\nWe identify neutral hadrons through the presence of\nan energy deposition in the EMC or a cluster in the\nIFR. Neutral hadrons must be spatially separated from\nall tracks in the event. In reconstructing the decay\nB 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KL0 neutral hadrons are taken as KL0 candidates, with requirements specifically tailored for this\nmode.\nOnly the measured direction of the neutral hadron is\nused for KL0 reconstruction, as its energy is poorly measured. The direction of the KL0 candidate is defined by\nthe line joining the vertex of the J/\u03c8 candidate and the\ncentroid of the EMC or IFR cluster.\nFor a KL0 to reach the IFR it must traverse the EMC\nmaterial, which amounts to approximately one nuclear\ninteraction length. As a consequence, half of the KL0\n\nmesons undergo detectable interactions in the EMC. We\nconsider EMC clusters with energy in the 0.2 - 2.0 GeV\nrange. Most clusters arising from KL0 interactions have\nenergy below the upper bound; below the lower bound\nthe contamination from noise becomes significant. All\nsuch EMC clusters which are spatially separated from a\ntrack are considered as KL0 candidates, except those that\ncombined with another neutral cluster give an invariant\nmass compatible with a \u03c0 0 .\nAbout 60% of KL0 mesons from B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KL0 leave a\ndetectable signal in the IFR. We select KL0 candidates\nin the IFR starting with clusters of hits not spatially\nmatched to a track. IFR clusters with hits only in the\nouter layers of the forward endcap are rejected to reduce\nthe contribution from beam backgrounds.\nVI.\n\nEVENT SELECTION AND B MESON\nCOUNTING\n\nA determination of B meson branching fractions depends upon an accurate measurement of the number of\nB mesons in the data sample. We find the number of BB\npairs by comparing the rate of multihadron events in data\ntaken on the \u03a5 (4S) resonance to that in data taken offresonance. The BB purity of the sample is enhanced by\nrequiring the events to pass the following selection criteria, in which all tracks (including those that do not satisfy\nour usual selection requirements) in the fiducial region\n0.410 < \u03b8 < 2.54 rad and all neutral clusters with energy\ngreater than 30 MeV in the region 0.410 < \u03b8 < 2.409 rad\nare considered:\n\u2022 The event must satisfy either the L3 DCH or L3\nEMC trigger.\n\u2022 There must be at least three tracks that satisfy the\nstandard selection requirements in the fiducial region.\n\u2022 The ratio of the second to the zeroth Fox-Wolfram\nmoment [18] must be less than 0.5.\n\u2022 The event vertex is calculated by an iterative procedure that begins by considering every track in\nthe event, and then discards those that contribute\na large \u03c72 to the fit (these are presumed to arise\nfrom the decay of long-lived particles) until the vertex fit is stable. This vertex must be within 0.5 cm\nof the beam spot center in xy and within 6 cm in\nz. The beam spot has an RMS width of about 120\n\u03bcm in x, 5.9 \u03bcm in y, and 0.9 cm in z. The point\nof closest approach of a high-momentum track to\nthe beam spot is measured with a resolution of 23\n\u03bcm in x and y, and 29 \u03bcm in z, as determined with\ndimuon events.\n\u2022 The total energy of charged and neutral particles\nis required to be greater than 4.5 GeV.\n\n\f9\n60\n\n(a)\n\nEntries/4 MeV/c\n\n2\n\nTABLE IV: Summary of observed invariant mass or mass difference \u2206m widths for all intermediate mesons considered in\nthis paper. For most mesons the width is dominated by experimental resolution, and the value reported in the table is\nthe width \u03c3 from a Gaussian fit to the data. For the K \u2217\nmodes the natural width of the resonance dominates, and the\nvalue reported is the full width of a Breit-Wigner fit to the\ndata. The width for J/\u03c8 and \u03c8(2S) decaying to e+ e\u2212 is\ngreater than that for \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 due to the energy lost through\nbremsstrahlung.\nDecay mode\nWidth ( MeV/c2 )\n+ \u2212\ne e\n17 \u00b1 2\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n13 \u00b1 1\n\u03c8(2S) mass\ne+ e\u2212\n29 \u00b1 6\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\n21 \u00b1 3\n\u2206m(\u03c8(2S) \u2212 J/\u03c8 ) \u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ;\n7\u00b11\nJ/\u03c8 \u2192 l+ l\u2212\n\u2206m(\u03c7c1 \u2212 J/\u03c8 )\nJ/\u03c8 \u2192 l+ l\u2212\n14 \u00b1 1\n0\nKS mass\n\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212\n3.5 \u00b1 0.2\n\u03c00 \u03c00\n15 \u00b1 2\n\u22170\n+\nK mass\nK \u03c0 \u2212 and\n60 \u00b1 7\nKS0 \u03c0 0\nK \u2217+ mass\nKS0 \u03c0 + and\n50 \u00b1 10\nK + \u03c00\nQuantity\nJ/\u03c8 mass\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n2.9\n\n3\n\n3.1\n\n3.2\n2\n\nJ/\u03c8 mass (GeV/c )\n\n100\n\nEntries/4 MeV/c\n\n2\n\n(b)\n\nThese requirements are 95.4 \u00b1 1.4% efficient for BB\nevents, as estimated from a Monte Carlo simulation.

Our general\nstrategy when forming these candidates is to assign the\nexpected masses to tracks and neutral clusters, and to\napply a vertex constraint before computing the invariant\nmass. In rare instances (less than 1% of all meson candidates) the vertex fit does not converge. The sum of the\ntrack and/or cluster four-vectors is used to compute the\ninvariant mass for such candidates. If one or more decay\nproducts from a given particle are themselves intermediate states, we constrain them to their known masses.\nAt each step in the decay chain, we require that mesons\nhave masses consistent with their assumed particle type.\nThe mass resolutions observed for all of the intermediate\nmesons considered in this paper are listed in Table IV.\nWe choose meson selection criteria to maximize the expected precision of our branching fraction measurements.\nTherefore we use well-understood quantities in our selection, which lead to a smaller systematic uncertainty.\n\u221a We\nset the selection values to maximize the ratio S/ S + B\nwhere S and B are the expected number of signal and\nbackground events respectively, as estimated from Monte\nCarlo.

Otherwise, selection values similar to those in previouslyobserved modes are taken as a starting point, and then\nmodified to reduce background (as measured in the kinematic sidebands) or increase signal efficiency (as measured using Monte Carlo simulated\nsignal events). In\n\u221a\nmost cases, we find that S/ S + B does not change significantly when selection values are varied near their optima. This allows us to choose standard selection values\nacross most final states.\nA.\n\nCharmonium Meson Candidate Selection\n\n\f2\n\n20\n(a)\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nEntries/20 MeV/c\n\nEntries/20 MeV/c\n\n2\n\n10\n1\n\n40\n30\n\n(b)\n\n20\n10\n0\n3.5\n\n4\n\n\u03c8(2S) mass (GeV/c )\n\nEntries/5 MeV/c\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(c)\n\n40\n20\n0\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\nJ/\u03c8 Selection\n\n0.65\n\nJ/\u03c8 candidates are required to have an invariant mass\nin the range 2.95 < MJ/\u03c8 < 3.14 GeV/c2 and 3.06 <\nMJ/\u03c8 < 3.14 GeV/c2 for J/\u03c8 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212\ndecays respectively.

For \u03c8(2S) \u2192 e+ e\u2212 candidates the\nlower bound is relaxed to 250 MeV/c2 below the known\nvalue. For decays of the \u03c8(2S) to J/\u03c8 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , the difference in mass between the \u03c8(2S) and J/\u03c8 candidates is\nrequired to be within 15 MeV/c2 of the expected value,\nand the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 invariant mass m\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 is required to be between 0.4 and 0.6 GeV/c2 . The latter requirement takes\nadvantage of the fact that m\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 is most often in the\nupper portion of the kinematically allowed range [20].\nAll \u03c8(2S) candidates are required to have a momentum\nin the center-of-mass frame between 1.0 and 1.6 GeV/c,\nconsistent with B \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K decays.\nWe have used the same lepton identification requirements as for the J/\u03c8 reconstruction.

For most channels, \u2206Emax is 120 MeV, but for the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KS0 (KS0\n\u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) and B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 \u03c0 0 channels, which have larger\n\u2206E resolution, it is increased to 150 and 400 MeV respectively. We define the signal region by fitting the observed\ndistribution of events in the signal neighborhood in mES\nand \u2206E separately. In the fit, the signal component is\nmodelled by a Gaussian, and the background component\nis modelled by an empirical phase-space distribution [21]\n(henceforth referred to as the ARGUS distribution) when\nfitting the mES distribution, or a polynomial when fitting\nthe \u2206E distribution. The ARGUS distribution is\np\nA(mES ; m0 , c) \u221d mES 1 \u2212 (mES /m0 )2 ) \u00d7\nexp(c(1 \u2212 (mES /m0 )2 )),\n(4)\nwhere m0 is set to a typical beam energy and c is a fitted\nparameter.\nThe widths of the fitted Gaussians provide a measurement of the resolution in \u2206E and mES , and the signal\nregion is defined as \u00b13\u03c3 about the nominal value in each\nvariable. The resolution in mES is typically 3 MeV/c2 ,\n\nand that in \u2206E is typically 10 MeV for channels with no\nneutral particles in the final state and 30 MeV otherwise.\nThe signal region for each mode is given in Table V.\nA somewhat different procedure is required for reconstructing B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KL0 , since the KL0 energy is not measured. Either the B mass or energy must be constrained,\nleaving only one independent variable. We choose to\nfix the B mass to its known value [19] and plot the\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nsignal in the quantity \u2206EKL0 \u2261 EJ/\u03c8\n+ EK\n0 \u2212 Ebeam ,\nL\n\u2217\nwhere EJ/\u03c8\nis the energy of the mass-constrained J/\u03c8 ,\n\u2217\nand EK\nis\nthe\nenergy of the KL0 as determined using\n0\nL\nthe B mass constraint, both in the center-of-mass frame.\n\u2206EKL0 is a measure of the same quantity as \u2206E; we\nuse the different notation to reflect the fact that the B\nmass constraint is used only in this channel. For signal,\n\u2206EKL0 is expected to peak at zero with a resolution of\napproximately 3.5 MeV. The signal region is defined as\n|\u2206EKL0 | < 10 MeV.\n1\n\nHelicity and Thrust Angle Definitions\n\nWe use the helicity angles \u03b8B and \u03b8l to help distinguish\nsignal from background. \u03b8B is the angle in the center-ofmass frame between the electron beam and B candidate\n\n\f14\n\n\u2206E (GeV)\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n-0.05\n\nentries/2.5 MeV/c2\n\n-0.1\n100\n75\n\n(a)\nB0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K0 (\u03c0+\u03c0-)\n\n50\n25\n0\n5.2\n\n5.225\n5.25\n5.275\n2\nmES (GeV/c )\n\n5.3\n\n\u2206E (GeV)\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n-0.05\n\nentries/2.5 MeV/c2\n\n-0.1\n20\n\n(b)\n\n15\n\nB0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K0 (\u03c00\u03c00)\n\n10\n5\n0\n5.2\n\n60\nEntries/2 MeV\n\ndirections, and \u03b8l is the angle in the charmonium meson\nrest frame between the l\u2212 and light meson candidate\ndirections. Figure 7 gives a schematic representation of\nthese angles for the decay B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KS0 .\nThe angle \u03b8B has a sin2 \u03b8B distribution for \u03a5 (4S) meson decays. If X is a pseudoscalar (K 0 , K + , \u03c0 0 ) then\nthe charmonium meson must be longitudinally polarized,\nand the resulting \u03b8l distribution is proportional to sin2 \u03b8l .\nIf X is a vector (K \u2217 ) the decay angular distribution depends on more than one helicity amplitude. In this case\nthe lepton angular distributions are not known a priori\nand must be experimentally determined.\nThe B candidates formed from light quark backgrounds will generally follow a 1 + cos2 \u03b8B angular distribution. The \u03b8l helicity angle is especially useful in\nrejecting background since the distribution of cos \u03b8l is\npeaked at \u00b11 for background and at zero for signal for\nmodes where X is a pseudoscalar. As an example, the\ndistribution of cos \u03b8l observed in data for B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KS0\nand B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + candidates is shown in Fig. 8.\nFor modes where the charmonium meson decays to\nmore than two bodies, and \u03b8l is therefore undefined, we\nsuppress backgrounds using the thrust angle \u03b8T , defined\nas the angle between the thrust axis of the reconstructed\nB and that of the rest of the event in the center-of-mass\nframe. We use the conventional definition of the thrust\naxis for a collection of particles as the direction about\nwhich the transverse momenta of the particles is minimized. In BB events cos \u03b8T is uniformly distributed,\nwhereas in continuum background events \u03b8T tends to\npeak at \u03c0 radians due to the two-jet nature of these\nevents. Hence \u03b8T can be used to discriminate against\nbackground in modes where the helicity angle is not applicable.\nThe helicity and thrust angle values used to select candidates are listed in the appropriate exclusive reconstruction and selection subsections in this paper.\n\n5.225\n5.25\n5.275\nmES (GeV/c2)\n\n5.3\n\nB0 \u2192 J/\u03c8K0 (KL)\n\n(c)\n\nSignal + background\nTotal Background\n40\n\nJ/\u03c8 Background\n\n20\n2\n\nMultiple Candidates\n\nWe only allow one exclusive candidate per event in a\ngiven decay mode. In the cases where we have multiple candidates (less than 10% of all events with a candidate for most modes, but up to 30% for the K \u2217 modes\nwhich have significant crossfeed among decay channels),\nthe candidate with the lowest |\u2206E| is taken over all others. The only exception is in the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KL0 selection,\nwhere we choose the candidate with the largest KL0 energy as measured by the EMC. If none of the candidate\nKL0 mesons have EMC information, we choose the candidate that has the largest number of layers with hits in the\nIFR. These criteria are used because background candidates tend to have low EMC energy or IFR multiplicity.\n\n0\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n40\n\u2206E (MeV)\n\n60\n\n80\n\nFIG. 9: Signals for B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KS0 ((a) KS0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and (b)\nKS0 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 ) and (c) B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KL0 .

Therefore, we\nselect events where the total missing momentum is not\nless than 0.65 GeV/c below the calculated KL0 momentum. The missing momentum requirement is not applied\nwhen the KL0 candidate is identified in the IFR, since the\nbackground is much lower in this sample.\nFor all events, we use the angles \u03b8B and \u03b8l to suppress\nbackground. We require that | cos \u03b8B | and | cos \u03b8l | be less\nthan 0.9.

We require that the K +\ncandidate be inconsistent with a pion hypothesis, using\nthe combined information from dE/dx measured in the\nSVT and DCH and Cherenkov angle measured in the\nDIRC. We require both tracks from the J/\u03c8 to pass either the tight electron selection or the loose muon selection. \u03c7c1 candidates are selected if the mass difference between the \u03c7c1 and the J/\u03c8 lies between 0.37 and\n0.45 GeV/c2 . K \u22170 candidates are reconstructed using the\nstandard procedure, and are accepted if the K \u22170 mass is\nwithin 75 MeV/c2 of the known value [19].\nThe distribution of the selected candidates in \u2206E and\nmES is shown in Fig. 12 (c).\nVIII.\n\n0\n\nB 0 \u2192 \u03c7c1 KS0 and B + \u2192 \u03c7c1 K +\n\nB 0 \u2192 \u03c8(2S)KS0 and B + \u2192 \u03c8(2S)K +\n\nCharged B candidates are formed from the combination of a \u03c8(2S) candidate with a track, and neutral candidates from the combination of \u03c8(2S) and KS0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212\ncandidates.\nIn the leptonic decay mode of the \u03c8(2S), | cos \u03b8l | is\nrequired to be less than 0.8. In the J/\u03c8 decay mode of\n\nBackgrounds to the decay modes we measure arise predominantly from three sources: other B decays that include charmonium mesons in the final state, B decays\nwithout charmonium mesons, and light quark events.\nMonte Carlo simulation studies verify that for B decays\nwithout charmonium mesons and for continuum events,\nB candidates follow the ARGUS distribution in mES .\nOn the other hand, the background from inclusive charmonium decays includes modes that are kinematically\nvery similar to the signal modes, which means that their\ndistribution in mES may have a peak in the signal region. As an example, Fig. 13 shows the distribution in\n\u2206E and mES for signal and background events satisfying\nthe B + \u2192 \u03c7c1 K + selection requirements. It is critical\nthat the so-called \"peaking background\" from other J/\u03c8\nmodes be well understood, since it contributes directly\nas a correction to the fitted number of signal events in\nthe signal band.\n\n\f18\n\nentries/5 MeV/c2\n\nCombinatorial\n\nSignal + background\nOther backgrounds\nJ/\u03c8 background\n\n80\n\nPeaking\n\nee modes \u03bc\u03bc modes\n\nee modes \u03bc\u03bc modes\n\n(a)\n\n60\n\nJ/\u03c8 \u03c0\n\n0\n\n40\n20\n\n\u03c7c1 K\n\n+\n\n\u03c7c1 K\n\n0\n\n\u03c7c1 K*\n\n0\n\n\u03c8(2S) K\n\n+\n\n0\n5.2\n\n5.225\n5.25\n5.275\n2\nmES (GeV/c )\n\n5.3\n\n\u03c8(2S) K\n\n0\n\nJ/\u03c8 K*\n\n80\n(b)\n\nentries/12 MeV\n\n60\n\n+\n\nJ/\u03c8 K\n\n*0\n\nJ/\u03c8 K\n\n+\n\nJ/\u03c8 K (KS\u2192\u03c0 \u03c0 )\n0\n\n40\n\nJ/\u03c8 K (KS\u2192\u03c0 \u03c0 )\n0\n\n-2 0 2 -2.5 0 2.5 -2.5 0 2.5 -5 0\n(Observed - Predicted)/Uncertainty\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0 0\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n0.05\n\u2206E (GeV)\n\n0.1\n\nFIG. 13: Distribution in (a) mES and (b) \u2206E of candidates\nfor B + \u2192 \u03c7c1 K + .

The available Monte Carlo samples are 10 million BB decays, the\nequivalent of 8 fb\u22121 of continuum events, and the equivalent of several times our data sample of inclusive B to\ncharmonium decays.\nWe compare the predicted and observed levels of background in two regions of the \u2206E-mES plane: the \u2206E\nsideband, defined as that part of the signal neighborhood sufficiently far from the signal region in |\u2206E| that\nit contains a negligible amount of signal (typically 4\u03c3\nfrom zero, though for modes with a \u03c0 0 in the final state\nthis is reduced to 3\u03c3), and the signal region.\nIn each region, we fit a Gaussian and an ARGUS background distribution to the observed mES distribution of\nB candidates in data and Monte Carlo samples. In the\n\u2206E sideband the integral of the Gaussian distribution\nacross the mES signal region provides an estimate of the\npeaking background. In the \u2206E signal region the integral\nof the ARGUS background function across the mES signal\nregion provides an estimate of the combinatorial background. A comparison between data and Monte Carlo\nsimulation of the fitted results for the combinatorial and\npeaking background components is displayed in Fig. 14.\nIn most cases, the predicted and observed backgrounds\nare in good agreement, within the statistical errors. Discrepancies in the predicted and observed levels of peaking\nbackgrounds in the \u2206E sideband region are accounted for\nin our estimation of systematic uncertainties.\nFor the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KL0 sample, we estimate the magnitude of the background by performing a binned loglikelihood fit to the \u2206EKL0 distribution in the range \u221220\nto 80 MeV. This fit is described in detail in Section X.\nThe shapes of the signal and inclusive charmonium background components are taken from Monte Carlo simulation. The shape of the non-charmonium background\ncomponent is taken from an ARGUS fit to the \u2206EKL0\ndistribution for events in the J/\u03c8 mass sideband. To constrain the magnitude of this last component, we first estimate the fraction of non-J/\u03c8 candidates in the J/\u03c8 mass\nwindow relative to the mass sideband for events with arbitrary \u2206EKL0 . We then scale the number of events with\n\u2206EKL0 between \u221220 and 80 MeV that also have a dilepton invariant mass in the J/\u03c8 sideband region by this\nfraction to determine the expected number of candidates\narising from non-charmonium backgrounds.\nThe dominant source of background for each mode we\nconsider is listed in Table VI.\nIX.\n\nEFFICIENCY CALCULATION\n\nThe selection efficiencies for each mode are obtained\nfrom detailed Monte Carlo simulations, in which the detector response is simulated using the GEANT3 [22] program. In addition, we have used the data where possible\n\nto determine the detector performance.\nWe have determined the efficiency for identifying leptons with the sample of inclusively produced J/\u03c8 's in the\ndata. J/\u03c8 's are selected by requiring that one track pass\nthe very tight electron or muon selection, with no lepton\nidentification requirement placed on the other track (the\ntest track). The fraction of test tracks that satisfy a given\nlepton selection provides a measure of the efficiency for\nthat selection.\nWe have determined the track finding efficiency from\nmultihadron events in the data. For the standard track\nselection, the fact that the SVT is an independent tracking device allows precise determination of the DCH efficiency by observing the fraction of tracks in the SVT\nthat are also found in the DCH. For low-momentum pions, such as those produced in the decay \u03c8(2S) \u2192 J/\u03c8\n\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , D\u2217 decays are used to provide information about\nthe efficiency as a function of momentum. This measurement takes advantage of the correlation between the pion\nhelicity angle in the D\u2217 rest frame and its momentum in\nthe center-of-mass frame. Since the helicity angle distribution is known, any deviation between the expected and\nobserved distributions can be interpreted as arising from\na momentum dependence in the track reconstruction efficiency. In addition, the efficiency for reconstructing a KS0\n\u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay has been determined as a function of the\nKS0 flight length from studies of inclusive KS0 production\nin the data.\nThe efficiency for detecting photon clusters has been\ndetermined from the data with a control sample of twoprong \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events. In the subsample of events tagged\nby a leptonic decay of one of the taus, we compare the\nnumber of events with one or two neutral pions, and one\ncharged pion, from the second tau decay. The ratio of\nthese two branching fractions is known to a precision of\n1.6% [19]. By comparing data with simulation, we determine a correction factor to be applied to the photon\nidentification efficiency. This factor is found to be independent of the photon energy.\nBoth the J/\u03c8 mass distribution and \u2206E signal distribution in the B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + sample have better resolution in the simulation than in the data, indicating that\nthe track pT resolution in the simulation is overestimated.\nTo account for this, we degrade the pT resolution of the\nsimulated tracks by amount chosen to bring the simulated\nJ/\u03c8 mass and \u2206E mass distributions into agreement with\nthose observed in data.\nWe measure the efficiency of the EMC and the IFR to\ndetect a KL0 candidate cluster using a control sample of\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03a6\u03b3, \u03a6 \u2192 KS0 KL0 events.\nThe efficiencies of the \u03c0 0 veto and missing transverse\nmomentum requirements applied for KL0 reconstruction\nin the EMC were determined using B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K + events.\nThe \u2206EKL0 distribution for simulated events is adjusted slightly to account for differences between data\nand Monte Carlo simulation in the beam energy spread\nand KL0 angular resolution. The correction to the beam\nenergy spread is derived from a study of B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K +\n\n\f20\nevents, and the adjustment for the KL0 angular resolution\nis determined with the e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03a6\u03b3 control sample.\nThe combination of these effects requires a correction\nfactor to be applied to the efficiency determined from the\nMonte Carlo simulation. The size of the correction varies\namong decay modes, and is at most 16%.\n\nentries/2.5 MeV/c2\n\nX.\n\n60\n\nBRANCHING FRACTION\nDETERMINATION\n\nTo derive branching fractions we have used the secondary branching fractions S published in Ref. [19]. An\nexception to this is the branching fraction of \u03c8(2S) \u2192\nl+ l\u2212 , where we have used our recent measurement of\n(6.6 \u00b1 1.1) \u00d7 10\u22123 [23] for the \u03c8(2S) \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 mode and\nthe measurement from E835 [24] for the \u03c8(2S) \u2192 e+ e\u2212\nmode. These measurements are more recent and more\naccurate than those included in Ref. [19].\nWe have assumed that \u03a5 (4S) decays produce an equal\nmixture of charged and neutral B mesons. The dependence of our results on this assumption is included in\nSection XII.\nFor all modes except B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KL0 , B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u22170 and\n+\nB \u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u2217+ , the number of signal events Ns within\nthe signal region of the \u2206E-mES plane is determined from\nthe observed number of events after background subtraction. The background has two components, as described\nin Section VIII: a combinatorial component, which is\nobtained by integrating the fitted ARGUS distribution\nin the signal region, and a peaking component that is\nobtained from inclusive B \u2192 J/\u03c8 X simulation after removing the signal channel. The procedure is illustrated\nin Fig. 15.\nWe determine the branching fraction by dividing Ns\nby the selection efficiency \u01eb, S, and the number of BB\nevents in the sample NBB . Where possible, the branching fraction is determined independently for the different\nsecondary decay modes, and the results combined statistically, taking into account correlations in the systematic\nerrors. For the channels that are statistically limited,\nwe determine the branching fraction using the combined\nsample of candidate B events, irrespective of the secondary decay mode:\nP\nNs,i\niP\nB=\n,\n(5)\nNBB i \u01ebi Si\nwhere the sum is over all decay modes considered.\nThe branching fractions for the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u22170 (B 0 )\nand B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u2217+ (B + ) modes are determined simultaneously from a likelihood fit, which is required to account for the cross-feed between the K \u2217 decay channels.\nThe cross-feed is largest for the mode B + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u2217+ ,\nwhere the K \u2217+ decays to K + \u03c0 0 . In this case, 12% of the\nselected candidates arise from other B\u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u2217 decays.\nThe likelihood function includes the cross-feed contributions as well as all other background sources, and has the\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n5.2\n\n5.225\n5.25\n5.275\n2\nmES (GeV/c )\n\n5.3\n\nFIG. 15:\nDistribution in mES of candidates for B + \u2192\n+\n\u03c7c1 K , with the ARGUS and Gaussian fit superimposed.\nThe number of signal events is calculated by counting the\nevents in the signal region of mES (marked by arrows) and\nsubtracting the integral of the fit ARGUS function across this\nregion (the shaded portion of the fit) and the peaking contribution from inclusive J/\u03c8 backgrounds, as shown in Fig. 13.\n\nform:\n0\n\n+\n\nL(B , B ) =\n\nij \u2212\u03bcij\nY \u03bcN\nij e\n\ni,j\n\nNij !\n\n(6)\n\nwhere i represents a decay mode of the K \u2217 (to KS0 or\nK + ), j represents either the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u22170 or B + \u2192\nJ/\u03c8 K \u2217+ mode, N is the observed number of events in\nthe signal region, and \u03bc is the expected number of events.\nThe last is given by:\nX \u2032\n\u03bcij = Nb,ij +\nB j \u01ebiji\u2032 j \u2032 Si\u2032 j \u2032 NBB\n(7)\ni\u2032 j \u2032\n\nwhere Nb is the number of background events estimated\nin the same manner as for the other channels.

The systematic error\nassociated with reconstructing a KS0 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 decay has\ntwo sources: knowledge of the reconstruction efficiency\nfor the two \u03c0 tracks, and differences in the selection criteria efficiencies observed between the inclusive KS0 data\nand the Monte Carlo simulation. The observed discrepancies and their statistical uncertainties are summed in\nquadrature to yield a systematic error of approximately\n5%.\nThe systematic error on lepton identification efficiencies arise from the statistics of the inclusive J/\u03c8 sample, and from comparing the efficiencies in different lowmultiplicity control samples. It varies from 0.5% to 2.8%\nper J/\u03c8 or \u03c8(2S) depending on the criteria used to select\nthe leptons.\n\nThe quality of the simulation of photon detection and\nenergy measurement in the EMC has been validated by\na detailed comparison between real and simulated data.\nIn particular, the position and resolution of the \u03c0 0 and \u03b7\nmass peaks in the photon pair mass spectrum has been\ncompared as function of photon energy, calorimeter occupancy and time of data collection. The agreement in\nterms of energy scale is found to be better than 0.75% in\nall cases; energy resolution is also well described at the\nlevel of 1.5%. The absolute photon detection efficiency\nis known to 1.25%. The resulting systematic errors on\nthe branching fractions are in the range of 1.3% to 5%\ndepending on the decay mode.\nWe account for the uncertainty in the pT resolution\nby varying the amount by which the Monte Carlo simulated momentum resolution is degraded within the range\nin which the data and Monte Carlo J/\u03c8 mass and \u2206E\nwidths are compatible. The observed variation in selection efficiency is between 0.1% and 1.3%. To account\nfor the possibility that other variables used in selecting\ncandidates may not be perfectly modelled in the simulation, we vary the selection requirements and repeat the\nbranching fraction measurement. In most cases the range\nof variation is \u00b11\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the width observed in data\nfor the variable under consideration, while for helicity\nangles a variation of \u00b10.05 in their cosine is used. The\nobserved variations in the results are between 2.5% and\n14.1%. Modes with a K \u2217 in the final state merit special\nmention, since there can be some variation of selection\nefficiency with the polarization of the vector meson, and\nthe polarization amplitudes are subject to experimental\nuncertainty. The Monte Carlo simulation from which we\nderive our efficiency assumes the polarization amplitudes\nmeasured by CLEO [25]. We have studied the changes\nin efficiency that occur when the amplitudes are varied by twice the difference between the values measured\nat CLEO and BABAR [13]. We find that these changes\nare consistent with those observed when the selection requirement on \u03b8K is varied.\nFor the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KL0 analysis, we include additional\nsystematic errors associated with the selection efficiency.\nThese originate from the uncertainty in the KL0 reconstruction efficiency and angular resolution determined\nfrom data, the knowledge of the absolute scale and spread\nof the beam energy, and from the various selection requirements used to isolate the signal.\nAnother systematic error arises from our knowledge of\nthe backgrounds. For all modes except B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KL0 ,\nwe use data in the \u2206E sideband to estimate this uncertainty. We determine the uncertainty in the size of\nthe combinatorial background by repeating the fit to the\ndata with the shape of the ARGUS function (the parameter c in Equation 4) fixed to the value obtained from\nfitting the \u2206E sidebands, allowing only the normalization to vary. This accounts for any correlation between\nthe ARGUS and Gaussian fits in the \u2206E signal region.\nWe estimate the uncertainty in the predicted size of the\npeaking background by comparing the observed Gaussian\n\n\f23\nTABLE IX: Measured branching fractions for exclusive decays of B mesons involving charmonium.

This procedure\ntakes advantage of the fact that the distribution of candidates from this background in \u2206E depends primarily\non kinematics rather than the poorly-known composition\nof the background. In particular, the background does\nnot peak in the signal region of \u2206E (see Fig. 13), which\nimplies that the relative normalization observed in the\n\u2206E sideband can also be expected to hold in the signal\nregion. The systematic error attributed to the knowledge of the backgrounds varies from 1.0% to 14.5% for\nthe various modes. In addition, for the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u22170 ,\nB + \u2192 J/\u03c8 K \u2217+ and B 0 \u2192 \u03c7c1 K \u22170 modes, a systematic error is included to account for the uncertainty in\nthe non-resonant B \u2192 J/\u03c8 K\u03c0 branching fractions, and\nthe contribution of feed-down from higher K \u2217 resonances.\nThis ranges from 1.4% to 3.7% depending on the mode.\nFor the B 0 \u2192 J/\u03c8 KL0 decay mode, we determine the\nuncertainty arising from knowledge of the shape of the\nnon-J/\u03c8 background both by changing the fitted parameters of the ARGUS function for this background component by one standard deviation and also directly in the fit\nby using the \u2206EKL0 distribution from the non-J/\u03c8 events\nin the data. The analysis is also repeated after varying\nthe values of the branching fractions for the component\nmodes in the simulation of B \u2192 J/\u03c8 X decays by the uncertainty quoted in Ref. [19]. This is done separately for\nthe main background modes and then for all the remaining modes together. Since the non-resonant B \u2192 J/\u03c8 K\u03c0\ncomponent is poorly measured, we vary it in the range\nfrom -50% to +400%.\nXII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn Table IX we summarize our branching fraction measurements.

Our results are in good agreement with previous measurements [19] and have superior precision, both\nin terms of individual branching fractions and their ratios. In addition, based on isospin invariance, we find the\nratio of charged to neutral B meson production on the\n\u03a5 (4S) resonance to be compatible with unity within two\nstandard deviations, and also compatible with the measurement reported by CLEO [26]. Our central value and\nCLEO's are both higher than one, with the difference in\nour case larger than one standard deviation.\n\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\n2.6\n0.1\n3.3\n5.8\n0.8\n2.8\n1.3\n2.7\n5.8\n\n41.2\n25.8\n22.6\n17.9\n22.0\n29.6\n19.1\n26.3\n13.9\n\nXIV.\n\n4.86\n3.01\n1.10\n1.09\n0.37\n1.46\n0.21\n0.85\n0.30\n\nBranching fraction/10\u22124\n8.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 0.6\n9.6 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b1 0.7\n6.8 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b1 0.8\n8.3 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b1 0.5\n10.1 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b1 0.5\n0.20 \u00b1 0.06 \u00b1 0.02\n12.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 0.9\n13.7 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b1 1.1\n6.9 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 1.1\n6.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 0.8\n5.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b1 1.1\n7.5 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b1 0.8\n4.8 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b1 0.9\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful for the extraordinary contributions\nof our PEP-II colleagues in achieving the excellent luminosity and machine conditions that have made this\nwork possible.
