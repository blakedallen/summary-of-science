Unfortunately, due to the prohibitively large dynamic range required, it is\nimpossible to self-consistently include these systems in cosmological simulations. Using fast\nand versatile semi-numeric simulations, we systematically explore the spatial distribution of\nabsorption systems during and following reionization. We self-calibrate the resulting number\nof absorbers to the mean free path (mfp) of the ionizing ultraviolet background (UVB), and\npresent results at a given mfp and neutral hydrogen fraction. We use a simple optical depth\ncriterion to identify the locations of absorbers. Our approach is fairly robust to uncertainties such as missing subgrid structure. Unlike at lower redshifts where the UVB is relatively\nuniform, at higher redshifts the fluctuations in the UVB and the HII morphology of reionization can drive the large-scale distribution of absorption systems. Specifically, we find that\nabsorbers are highly correlated with the density field on small scales, and then become anticorrelated with the UVB on large scales. After reionization, the large-scale power spectrum of\nthe absorbers traces the UVB power spectrum, which can be predicted with a simple analytic\nextension of the halo-model. During reionization, absorbers tend to preferentially lie inside\noverdensities (i.e. filaments) of the recently-ionized intergalactic medium (IGM). Absorbers\n\u22121\nmay also dominate the small-scale (k >\n\u223c 1 Mpc ) 21-cm power during and after reionization. Conversely, they smooth the contrast on moderate scales. Once the HII regions grow to\nsurpass the mfp, the absorbers add to the large-scale 21-cm power. Our results should prove\nuseful in interpreting future observations of the reionization epoch.\nKey words: cosmology: theory \u2013 intergalactic medium \u2013 diffuse radiation \u2013 large scale structure of universe \u2013 early Universe\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nRecent years have been witness to impressive advances in computer modeling of the reionization epoch (for a recent review,\nsee Trac & Gnedin 2009). Current, state-of-the-art simulations of\nreionization are capable of including the interactions of dark matter (DM), baryons, and an evolving ionizing radiation field on \u223c\n100 h\u22121 Mpc scales, while still resolving atomically-cooled halos at z <\n\u223c 10, which are thought to provide the bulk of the ionizing photons in the advanced stages of reionization (Trac et al.\n2008; Aubert & Teyssier 2010; for DM-only simulations see also\nMcQuinn et al. 2007a; Trac & Cen 2007). Such simulations have\nverified analytic models (e.g. Furlanetto et al. 2004), which conjectured that on large scales reionization proceeds in an \"inside-\n\n\u22c6\n\nHubble Fellow; email: mesinger@astro.princeton.edu\n\nc 2008 RAS\n\nout\" fashion, with overdense regions (which host the majority of\nsources) being ionized before underdense regions.\nThus far, most of the advances in computer modeling have focused on the sources of ionizing radiation. Current prescriptions for\nassigning ionizing luminosity to host halos and dealing with feedback mechanisms are still rather crude. Justifiably, much research\neffort has gone (and continues to go) into exploration of these uncertainties (e.g. McQuinn et al. 2007a; Mesinger & Dijkstra 2008;\nCroft & Altay 2008). Nevertheless, we are quite confident in our\nability to predict the distribution of DM halos that host the ionizing\nsources.\nUnfortunately, comparatively modest progress has been made\nin simulating the sinks of ionizing photons during reionization\n(with some notable recent exceptions; see below). These can potentially play important roles: as photon sinks, they can delay\nreionization (Ciardi et al. 2006; Alvarez & Abel 2010); they can\n\n\f2\n\nD. Crociani et al.\n\naffect the topology of reionization (Choudhury et al. 2009); they\ncan dominate the ionizing photon mean free path (mfp) and so regulate the ionizing ultraviolet background (UVB) during and after\nreionization (Furlanetto & Oh 2005; Furlanetto & Mesinger 2009);\nthey can be responsible for a non-negligible 21-cm signal during\nand after reionization (Choudhury et al. 2009; Wyithe et al. 2009a;\nWyithe & Loeb 2009b).\nThe difficulty lies in the dynamic range: small-scale structure\nwould need to be resolved, along with the complicated feedback\nmechanisms regulating it1 . Even at lower-redshifts (z <\n\u223c 4) where\nthere is a fair amount of observational data (e.g. Prochaska 1999;\nP\u00e9roux et al. 2003a; Prochaska et al. 2009), consensus has failed to\nemerge on the nature of the dominant absorbers, the so-called Lyman limit systems (LLSs), with studies associating them with lowmass dark matter halos (e.g. Katz et al. 1996; Gardner et al. 2001),\ngalactic or high-mass dark matter halos (e.g. Kohler & Gnedin\n2007a) or clumpy, so-called \"cold-flows\" of IGM gas streaming\nonto galaxies (e.g. Kere\u0161 et al. 2005). The situation is even more\ncomplicated at higher redshifts, where even more modest HI overabundances can contribute significantly to the ionizing photon\nopacity.\nInstead of self-consistently simulating them, photon sinks in\ncosmological simulations are generally taken into account via socalled \"clumping factors\", which are a measure of the mean recombination rate inside simulation cells (though see Ciardi et al.\n2006; McQuinn et al. 2007a). Clumping factors are often assumed\nto be spatially (and at times even temporally) uniform, though\nmore sophisticated techniques can use higher-resolution simulations (Kohler et al. 2007b) or analytic models (McQuinn et al.\n2007a) when assigning clumping factors to cells. However, adding\n\"by hand\" these missing small-scale modes while preserving their\nlarge-scale distribution is very uncertain. Furthermore, because\nonly the clumpiness of ionized gas is relevant for the recombination rate, the clumping factor approach requires assumptions that\n(1) the gas is already ionized and (2) that one knows a priori the distribution of the ionized and neutral regions (see e.g. the appendix\nin Furlanetto & Oh 2005; Iliev et al. 2005a).\nAlternatively, some simulations have included discrete, selfshielded photon sinks in the form of collapsed, unresolved structures via a subgrid approach (Ciardi et al. 2006; McQuinn et al.\n2007a). These studies use the conditional excursion set formalism\n(e.g. Bond et al. 1991; Lacey & Cole 1993) to populate the simulation cells with unresolved collapsed objects, concluding that they\ncan prolong the duration of reionization (Ciardi et al. 2006) and\nhave a sub-dominant role to sources in regulating the reionization\n1\n\nAlthough current cosmological reionization simulations can resolve\nthe Jeans length in the mean density, ionized IGM, most of the Universe\nwas only exposed to an ionizing background at redshifts around z \u223c 10\n(Larson et al. 2010). Before then, the collapse of non-linear structures occurred in a neutral medium with a much smaller Jeans mass. As the smallscale structure of the baryons depends on the local thermal history (not the\ninstantaneous Jeans mass; Hui & Gnedin 1997), simulations would need to\nresolve the collapse of DM and baryons on extremely small scales (e.g. the\nJeans length at z = 15 in even the mean density IGM is an impressivelysmall \u223c4 comoving pc), including self-consistent feedback mechanisms.\nThe situation might not be quite so bleak, however, as some fiducial astrophysical models predict an early epoch of X-ray heating (or some other\n3\nform of heating), which would smooth fluctuations on Tvir <\n\u223c few\u00d710\nK scales, if the heating was early enough and fairly homogeneous (e.g.\nFurlanetto 2006a; Mesinger et al. 2010). Nevertheless, even if this dynamic\nrange was achievable, a copious number of realizations would be needed to\nfully explore the dauntingly-large astrophysical parameter space.\n\nmorphology (McQuinn et al. 2007a). Again, it is unclear if the distributions of absorbers on large scales are well preserved in such\nsubgrid models which only depend on the local cell's density. More\nfundamentally, it is unclear how to associate absorption systems\nwith such collapsed \"minihalos\" (with virial temperatures < 104\nK) or with the halos hosting the ionizing sources (Wyithe et al.\n2009a).\nIn this paper, we take a more general approach. We do not\nattempt to model the progress of reionization and the accompanying role of absorption systems. Nor do we add missing small scale\npower in an effort to estimate the recombination rate inside each\ncell. Instead, we focus on predicting the large-scale distribution of\nabsorbers.\nMiralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. (2000, MHR00) and subsequently\nFurlanetto & Oh (2005) have assumed that absorption systems inside the ionized IGM at z \u223c 2\u20134 can be identified with a simple\ndensity threshold: regions of roughly the Jeans scale (computed\nat mean density and 104 K) whose density is above the threshold can be taken as fully neutral, while below the threshold, the\nIGM is fully ionized. In their appendix, Furlanetto & Oh (2005)\nhave shown that this is similar to imposing a self-shielding cutoff, \u03c4 >\n\u223c 1, at this critical density, given a homogeneous UVB.\nHowever, the ionizing background even in the cosmological HII\nregions becomes increasingly inhomogeneous at higher redshifts\n(Bolton & Haehnelt 2007; Mesinger & Furlanetto 2009), due to the\nincreasing clustering of sources and the decreasing mean free path\n(mfp).\nTherefore in this paper, we assign self-shielded absorbers to\ncells with an optical depth criterion which takes into account the\ninhomogeneous UVB. We use semi-numerical2 simulations to efficiently generate realizations of the density, halo, ionization (i.e.\nHII tomography), and ionizing flux fields. These are very fast\ncompared to numerical simulations, allowing one to independently\nvary many parameters, and yet still produce HII morphologies\nwhich are in good agreement with radiative transfer simulations\n(Zahn et al. 2007; Mesinger & Furlanetto 2007; Zahn et al. 2010;\nMesinger et al. 2010). We stress that, lacking the dynamic range\nand radiative transfer, we do not presume to model the size and photoevaporation of absorbers, two important ingredients in answering\nhow the absorbers affect the progress of reionization. Instead we\npresent results at a given mean IGM neutral hydrogen fraction and\nmean absorber number density that we calibrate to the associated\nreduction in ionizing flux.\nOur approach is very similar to the recent semi-numerical\nwork of Choudhury et al. (2009). Motivated by the suggestion that\nreionization proceeds very gradually in a \"photon-starved\" regime\n(as suggested by the interpretation of the z >\n\u223c 5 Ly\u03b1 forest by\nBolton & Haehnelt 2007), Choudhury et al. (2009) have modeled\nthe distribution of absorption systems and their impact on reionization morphology. To identify absorbers, they use an excursionset approach comparing the local recombination rate to the timeintegrated production rate of ionizing photons. Our approach differs from theirs in several main points (see \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 3 for more\ndetails): (1) we estimate the reionization morphology and the instantaneous ionizing flux separately; (2) we use a self-shielded criterion instead of a recombination criterion to identify the location\nof absorbers, the latter being more sensitive to the missing subgrid\n\n2 By \"semi-numerical\" we mean using more approximate physics than numerical simulations, but capable of independently generating 3D realizations.\n\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n\fThe distribution of absorbers\nsmall-scale power; (3) we use a self-calibrated, general approach to\ntake into account (albeit crudely) missing/approximate physics.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In \u00a7 2 we briefly summarize our semi-numerical modeling tools. In \u00a7 3, we present our prescription for identifying the locations of absorption systems. In \u00a7 4\nwe present our results, including statistical descriptions of the absorber field after and during reionization. Finally in \u00a7 5, we summarize our conclusions.\nUnless stated otherwise, we quote all quantities in comoving units. We adopt the background cosmological parameters (\u03a9\u039b ,\n\u03a9M , \u03a9b , n, \u03c38 , H0 ) = (0.72, 0.28, 0.046, 0.96, 0.82, 70 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 ), matching the five\u2013year results of the WMAP satellite\n(Komatsu et al. 2009).\n\n2 SEMI-NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\nWe use the semi-numerical code DexM3 to generate evolved\ndensity, halo, ionization and ionizing flux fields at z = 10.\nThe halo, density and ionization schemes are presented in\nMesinger & Furlanetto (2007, MF07), and the ionizing flux algorithm is presented in Mesinger & Dijkstra (2008). We refer the interested reader to those papers for more details. Here we briefly\noutline these schemes.\nOur simulation box is L = 100 Mpc on a side, with the final density, ionization, and flux fields having grid cell sizes of 0.5\nMpc. Halos are filtered out of the 16003 linear density field using\nexcursion-set theory. Halo locations are then mapped to Eulerian\ncoordinates at a given redshift using first-order perturbation theory (Zel'Dovich 1970). This approach is similar in spirit to the\n\"peak-patch\" formalism of Bond & Myers (1996). The displacement fields have an intermediate resolution of 8003 , in order to\nmost efficiently use the available RAM (velocity fields are correlated on larger scales than the density fields, thus they can afford\nworse resolution). The resulting halo fields have been shown to\nmatch both the mass function and statistical clustering properties\nof halos in N-body simulations, well past the linear regime (MF07,\nMesinger et al., in preparation).\nThe evolved (non-linear) density field is also computed in the\nsame manner, by perturbing the 16003 Lagrangian density field\nwith first-order perturbation theory. The resulting particle locations\nare then binned onto a Eulerian 2003 grid. The statistical properties of the density fields have been shown to match those from a\nhydrodynamic simulation remarkably well (Mesinger et al. 2010).\nSpecifically, the density PDF agrees with the numerical simulation\nat the percent level for over a dex around the mean density at z >\n\u223c7\nand roughly this cell size. Similarly, the density power spectra are\n\u22121\nextremely accurate at k <\n\u223c 5 Mpc . We show slices through our\ndensity and halo fields in Fig. 1.\nTo generate the ionization field, we use excursion-set formalism (Furlanetto et al. 2004) which compares the number of ionizing photons produced in a region of a given scale to the number of neutral hydrogen atoms inside that region. Specifically, we\nflag ionized cells in our box as those which meet the criterion\nfcoll (x, z, R) > \u03b6 \u22121 , where \u03b6 is some efficiency parameter and\nfcoll (x, z, R) is the collapse fraction smoothed around a cell at\n(x, z) on decreasing scales, R. The collapse fraction is computed\nusing the resolved halo field, including halos down to a minimum\nmass of 108 M\u2299 , corresponding to the atomic cooling threshold at\n\n3\n\nhttp://www.astro.princeton.edu/\u223cmesinger/Sim.html\n\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n3\n\nz \u223c 10. Note that homogeneous recombinations are implicitly included in the \u03b6 parameter. Also note that in this approach, unlike\nthe recent modifications presented in Zahn et al. (2010), the IGM\nis considered to be a two-phase medium, composed of either fullyionized or fully-neutral cells. This is an excellent approximation on\nsuch small-scales, provided that stellar spectra dominate reionization (see the appendix in Zahn et al. 2010).\nWe generate our ionizing flux fields following the procedure\ndescribed in Mesinger & Dijkstra (2008). We sum the contributions\nof halos with mass Mi at xi for which the line of sight to the considered cell at x only goes through ionized IGM:\nf (x, z) =\n\n(1 + z)2 X Mi \u00d7 \u01ebion \u2212|x\u2212xi |/\u03bb\ne\n.\n4\u03c0\n|x \u2212 xi |2\ni\n\n(1)\n\nHere, f (x, z) is the flux of ionizing photons at x (in s\u22121 pcm\u22122 ),\nand \u01ebion (z) is the the rate at which ionizing photons are released\ninto the IGM by a dark matter halo per unit mass. We assume\na fiducial value of \u01ebion (z) = 3.8 \u00d7 1058 \u03a9b /\u03a9M /tH (z) photons\n\u22121 \u22121\nM\u2299\ns which provides a good fit to the observed z \u223c 6 luminosity functions of Ly\u03b1 emitting galaxies (LAEs) (Kashikawa et al.\n2006; Shimasaku et al. 2006; Dijkstra et al. 2007; Stark et al. 2007;\nMcQuinn et al. 2007b), and the z = 6 Lyman Break galaxies\n(LBGs) (e.g. Bouwens et al. 2006). However this fiducial normalization can be subsumed in our optical depth normalization (see\n\u00a7 3) and is not relevant when presenting results at a fixed number\ndensity of absorbers. What we are really after is the spatial distribution of flux, and its impact on the distribution of absorbers. Hence,\nwhere applicable we present most results in terms of the normalized\nflux,\nfN (x, z) \u2261 f (x, z)/f \u0304(z) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f \u0304 is the mean value of the flux field for x\u0304HI = 0. We chose\nto normalize by the flux post-reionization to facilitate direct comparisons at the various reionization stages.\nThe free parameter \u03bb in eq. (1) is the assumed mean free path\nof the UV photons in the ionized IGM. We use the mean free path\nto self-calibrate the number of absorbers with the flux fields, as described in \u00a7 3. There is considerable disagreement among present\nobservational estimates of the mfp at the highest redshifts accessible to such observations, z \u223c 4 (Storrie-Lombardi et al. 1994;\nStengler-Larrea et al. 1995; P\u00e9roux et al. 2003b, Prochaska et al.\n2009, c.f. their Fig. 14, Songaila & Cowie 2010). Furthermore,\nthere is no reason to expect that the empirically-derived redshift\nevolution of \u03bb in these studies should extend to higher redshifts.\nTherefore, we try to be general in our conclusions, and show results from two fiducial values of \u03bb = 10 and 20 Mpc.\nFor our \u03bb = 10 (20) Mpc cases we obtain f \u0304 \u2243 2.5 (4.3)\u00d7104\nionizing photons s\u22121 pcm\u22122 , which corresponds to the mean ionization rate \u0393\u0304 \u2243 2 (3.3) \u00d7 10\u221213 s\u22121 . Note that in addition\nto matching the LAE and LBG luminosity functions as mentioned above, our procedure results in values of \u0393\u0304 which are\nconsistent with recent analysis of the z \u223c 5\u20136 Lyman-\u03b1 forest, provided \u0393\u0304 does not evolve much from z \u223c 6 to z \u223c 10\n(e.g. Bolton & Haehnelt 2007; note that \u0393\u0304 already was found not\nto evolve much from z \u223c 3 to z \u223c 6). For more detailed\nanalyses of the ionizing flux distributions, we refer readers to\nMesinger & Dijkstra (2008).\nFinally, we stress that our flux fields, unlike those implicitly\ncomputed in Choudhury et al. (2009), take into account the complex morphology of the HII regions. HII bubbles are not very spherical in the advanced stages of reionization (e.g. McQuinn et al.\n\n\f4\n\nD. Crociani et al.\n\nFigure 1. Slices through the matter overdensity field, \u03b4(x, z) \u2261 \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 \u2212 1 (left panel) and the corresponding halo field (right panel). Both slices are 100 Mpc\non a side and 0.5 Mpc deep.\n\n2007a; Trac & Cen 2007, MF07). Therefore, many sources within\nthe mfp will still not contribute to the local ionization rate, since\nthey do not have a \"clear line of sight\" to the cell. Instead, these\nphotons will go into expanding the HII regions and altering their\nmorphological structure.\n\n3 IDENTIFYING SELF-SHIELDED ABSORPTION\nSYSTEMS\nUsing the modeling tools summarized in the previous section, we\ncompute the density, halo, HII morphology, and ionizing flux fields.\nThe next step therefore is to identify the likely locations of selfshielded absorption systems. As mentioned in the introduction, we\ndo this with an optical depth criterion, which takes into account the\ninhomogeneity of both the density field and the UVB. Simulation\ncells with\n\u03c4 (x, z) > 1\n\nwhere \u03b1B is the case-B recombination coefficient4 at T = 104\nK (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006), and \u0393(x, z) = f (x, z)\u03c3H is the\nlocal ionization rate computed using eq. (1).\nThe parameter, A, in eq. (4) is used to roughly (and homogeneously) incorporate missing/uncertain physical components of our\napproach (e.g. the absorber cross-section; see below). We use it to\nself-calibrate the resulting number density of absorbers according\nto\nh\u221a\ni\u22121\n\u03bb=\n2nSS (A)dx2\n,\n(6)\nwhere nSS (A) = NSS (A)/L3 is the number density of the selfshielded regions and NSS (A) is the number of self-shielded pixels\nfound through the self-shielding criterion. We self-calibrate our results by choosing A such that the RHS of eq. (6) matches the mfp5\nused to calculate the flux fields, i.e. eq. (1). For better statistics, this\ncalibration is done in a fully-ionized universe; therefore the freeparameter A is the same for all values of x\u0304HI and only depends on\nthe mean separation of absorbers6 .\nOur cell size roughly matches the Jeans mass in the ionized\nIGM, thus crudely mimicking the effects of Jeans smoothing. However, as noted above, small-scale fluctuations are not set by the instantaneous Jeans mass, but instead depend on the local thermal\n\n(3)\n4\n\nare estimated to contain enough neutral gas to host self-shielded\nabsorption systems. Note that since we present results at a fixed\nnumber density of absorbers, the precise value of the RHS of eq. (3)\nis irrelevant (see below). The optical depth across a cell is estimated\naccording to\n\u03c4 (x, z) = A xHI nH \u03c3H dx ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere dx is our cell length of 0.5/(1 + z) pMpc, and \u03c3H \u223c\n6 \u00d7 10\u221218 pcm2 is the photoionization cross section of the hydrogen (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006), nH (x, z) is the cell's (proper)\nnumber density of hydrogen, xHI is the local neutral fraction computed assuming ionization equilibrium,\nnH xHI \u0393 = n2H (1 \u2212 xHI )2 \u03b1B ,\n\n(5)\n\nThe Case A value is more appropriate if the ionizing photons are absorbed inside dense, neutral systems (e.g. MHR00); however, at higher redshifts, an increasing fraction of photons get absorbed in moderate optical\ndepth systems (e.g. Furlanetto & Oh 2006c). In any case, the choice of recombination coefficients is not important, as it gets subsumed in the \"A\"\nnormalization parameter.\n5 Note that eq. (6) directly normalizes the resulting number density of absorbers, not the mfp. If absorbers are inhomogeneously distributed, the actual mfp can be different than predicted by the above equation.\n6 Since A is related to the intrinsic self-shielding properties of our simulation cells, it should be much more sensitive to the mfp than to x\u0304HI .\nFurthermore the above calibration only makes sense if the attenuation of\nthe ionizing background is indeed dominated by the number density of absorbers; i.e. when the ionizing photons are no longer absorbed by the HII\nbubble walls. This is only the case in the advanced stages of reionization,\nwhen the HII bubbles grow to be larger than the mfp (Mesinger & Dijkstra\n2008; Furlanetto & Mesinger 2009). In the early stages of reionization before this transition, the ionizing background is instead dominated by the HII\nmorphology and is therefore insensitive to the mfp in the HII regions.\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n\fThe distribution of absorbers\nhistory and their state of evolution when first exposed to a UVB.\nTherefore it is very likely that, like all cosmological reionization\nsimulations, we are missing subgrid structure. Processes such as\nthe subgrid recombination rate and the photoevaporation rates of\nabsorbers are indeed very sensitive to the detailed profiles of the\nionized and neutral gas (e.g Iliev et al. 2005b; Ciardi et al. 2006;\nMcQuinn et al. 2007a; Choudhury et al. 2009). However, in this\npaper we are merely concerned with identifying the locations of\nself-shielded systems. For this task, the simple criterion of \"there is\nenough neutral gas in the cell\" of eq. (3) is likely a decent indicator\nthat there are one or more absorption systems inside the cell (c.f.\nthe appendix of Furlanetto & Oh 2005). Furthermore, any homogeneous dependence of our results on the missing small-scale power\n(such as the absorber cross-section) is incorporated via our calibration parameter A. We obtain A \u223c 3 (4) for our \u03bb = 10 (20) Mpc\nmodels.\nUnfortunately, there is an inconsistency in the above selfcalibration. As we shall see below, the distribution of absorption\nsystems at high redshifts is likely very inhomogeneous. This makes\nthe smooth flux attenuation term, exp[\u2212r/\u03bb], only a rough approximation. Such a smooth attenuation is more naturally interpreted\nas being due to the integrated column density of low-\u03c4 systems\n(i.e. the Ly\u03b1 forest). If these more common systems did in fact\ndominate the absorption of ionizing photons at high redshifts, then\nour assumption of a global mfp is quite reasonable. However, if\nthe flux was dominated by such low-\u03c4 systems, then our calibration in eq. (6) would be unnecessary, since the flux is not sensitive\nto self-shielded absorbers. Then our results would best be interpreted at a fixed number density of absorbers, with the absorber\nabundance unrelated to the attenuation of the UVB. Interestingly,\nFurlanetto & Oh (2005) find that at z >\n\u223c 6, the contribution of selfshielded LLSs and the Ly\u03b1 forest to the UV optical depth is roughly\ncomparable, though this estimate is model-dependent and only applied to the post-reionization regime. Indeed, since our values of\nA are somewhat higher than unity, it is possible that some of the\nabsorption systems we flag are in fact lower-\u03c4 cells more appropriate for the Ly\u03b1 forest (see eq. 4). An improvement to our approach\nwould be to assign parameterized cross-sections to each absorber\nand iteratively compute the UVB (which could have additional\nsmooth attenuation from low-\u03c4 systems) and absorber fields until\nthe two converge. In this way the UVB and absorber distributions\nwould be self-consistent. However this is both time-consuming and\nof dubious benefit, given our present ignorance of absorber properties at high-redshift. Given the above uncertainties, one should\nkeep in mind that our quantitative estimates below are less robust\nthan our qualitative ones.\nAlthough we allow absorbers to be hosted by the same cells\nhosting ionizing sources, we do not explicitly model the HI content of the interstellar medium (ISM). Resolution requirements and\ndetailed feedback processes make it very difficult to simulate a statistical sample of such absorbers. At lower redshifts, high opacity systems such as Damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) are indeed associated with galactic mass dark matter halos (Wolfe et al.\n2005). On the other hand, low opacity systems such as the Lyman \u03b1 forest are associated with the filamentary structure of the\nweb (e.g. Schaye 2001). At z \u223c 5, the total UV opacity is dominated by the intermediate opacity LLSs (Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2003;\nP\u00e9roux et al. 2005), with the nature of these systems being the least\nunderstood. As already mentioned, the IGM can self-shield much\neasier at higher redshifts (Furlanetto & Oh 2005). Therefore it is\nlikely that at the epochs we consider, the total UV opacity is in fact\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n5\n\ndominated by absorbers residing in the IGM, which are simpler to\nmodel.\nFinally, we point out that our method, unlike the one in\nChoudhury et al. (2009), computes the reionization morphology\nseparately from the absorber locations. The overall reionization\nmorphology depends on the complete ionization history, whereas\nthe absorber distributions are more sensitive to the instantaneous\nionizing flux. Indeed, using large-scale, DM-only simulations with\nradiative transfer McQuinn et al. (2007a) find that absorption systems have a small impact on reionization morphology, even with\nextreme assumptions, such as a small mfp and no photoevaporation (see the bottom panel of Fig. 10 in McQuinn et al. 2007a).\nSimilarly, shadowing effects from the absorbers should be small\nsince ionizing sources are comparably very abundant with many\nsources from many directions contributing to the local ionizing\nbackground. Nevertheless, we stress that treating absorption systems separately from the HII morphology is an assumption of our\nmethod, not a result.\n\n4 RESULTS\n4.1 Absorber Distributions After Reionization\nHere we briefly discuss our results post-overlap, i.e. when x\u0304HI =\n07 . This is the simplest case we consider, since the HII morphology\nhas no impact on the results. Therefore it is a good place to start and\nbuild some physical intuition, before proceeding to the reionization\nepoch.\nIn Figures 2 and 3, we show slices through the flux (top panels) and ionization (bottom panels) fields, generated assuming \u03bb =\n10 Mpc (Fig. 2) and \u03bb = 20 Mpc (Fig. 3). The right-most columns\ncorrespond to the post-reionization regime.\nWe see that even post-reionization, the UVB is spatially inhomogeneous, with the inhomogeneity increasing with decreasing mfp. Even on large, \u223c10 Mpc scales, spatial fluctuations in\nthe UVB can be a factor of a few around the mean; on smaller\nscales, fluctuations can even be a factor of ten around the mean\n(Mesinger & Dijkstra 2008; Mesinger & Furlanetto 2009). This is\nin sharp contract to the moderate and low redshift regime (z <\n\u223c\n4), where spatial fluctuations contribute only a few percent of\nthe mean value of the UVB (Zuo 1992; Fardal & Shull 1993;\nGnedin & Hamilton 2002; Meiksin & White 2004; Croft 2004;\nBolton et al. 2006).\nThese fluctuations in the UVB indeed have a strong impact\non the distribution of absorbers. Looking at the corresponding distributions of absorbers (shown as green dots in the bottom panels of Figures 2 and 3), one can see that they preferentially lie\nin regions with a weaker UVB, far from large clusters of ionizing\nsources (shown as black dots). This effect is even more pronounced\nwhen the mfp is larger. As a result, the absorbers themselves are\nspatially inhomogeneous. If this absorber inhomogeneity was selfconsistently included in our UVB calculation, it would further increase its fluctuations.\nOn the other hand, some absorbers are seen to lie close\n\n7 We present results in this work at fixed x\u0304 , which is computed without\nHI\nthe contribution from the HI inside the absorption systems. This is the most\nnatural way to highlight the additional impact of absorption systems, and\nit also avoids having to assume how much of the absorber's gas is actually\nneutral.\n\n\f6\n\nD. Crociani et al.\n\nFigure 2. Upper panels: the normalized flux field calculated assuming \u03bb = 10 Mpc, for x\u0304HI = 0.72, 0.45, 0.18, 0 (left to right). Lower panels: the corresponding\nionization fields. Neutral regions are shown in red, while ionized regions are shown in white. Halo locations are marked with black points, while absorber\nlocations are marked with green points. All slices are 100 Mpc on a side and 0.5 Mpc deep and correspond to the same region shown in Fig. 1.\n\nFigure 3. Same as Fig. 2, but assuming \u03bb = 20 Mpc.\n\nto ionizing sources. These absorbers likely lie in overdense regions, where the high gas density manages to shield them from\nthe increased ionizing radiation. Note that the optical depth scales\nroughly as \u03c4 \u221d (\u03b4 + 1)2 f \u22121 .\nTo quantify these trends in Fig. 4, we show the crosscorrelation function, \u03be(R), of the binary absorber field with the\n\ndensity (left panel) and the flux (right panel) fields. This figure\nconfirms the qualitative intuition from above. At small scales, absorbers are highly correlated with overdensities. This correlation\nincreases as the background becomes more uniform and there are\nfewer absorbers. However, on large scales, absorbers become anticorrelated with the density field instead lying in large-scale underc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n\fThe distribution of absorbers\n0.5\n\n7\n\nflux\nxHI =0\n\ndensity\nxHI =0\n\n\u03be(R)\n\n0.3\n0.1\n-0.1\n-0.3\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\nR/Mpc\n\nR/Mpc\n\nFigure 4.

This effect is even more\nprominent in the strong anti-correlation of the absorbers and the\nUVB on large-scales. Note that our boundary conditions which\nsuppress modes larger than the box size bring the cross-correlation\nback to zero as one approaches the box size.\nTherefore scales are very important in understanding the distribution of absorbers. On small scales, the density dependence of\nthe optical depth dominates, and the density field determines the\nabsorber locations. On the other hand, on large scales it is the ionizing flux which governs the locations of absorbers. This is expected since the UVB is correlated on larger scales than the density\nfield. The scale at which this transition happens and the strength\nof the (anti-)correlation depend on the mfp. Thus, our results argue\nagainst the common practice of adding substructure to ionization\ncells based on just the local density; long-wavelength modes should\nalso be considered. In particular, the sources are much more biased\nthan the absorbers, so fluctuations in the ionizing background \u2013\nwhich extend to large scales around a clump of sources \u2013 dominate\nthe variations in the absorber population.\n\n4.2 Absorber Distributions During Reionization\nNow that we have a better understanding of the scale-dependent\nabsorber distributions post-reionization, we explore how these are\naffected by the HII morphological structure during reionization.\nReionization morphology further modulates the ionization field, as\ncan be seen in the top panels of Figures 2 and 3. From the bottom\npanels of these figures, we confirm that the absorbers preferentially\ncluster in regions of weak flux. During reionization, this translates\nto the edges of HII regions.When the process is viewed at a fixed \u03bb,\nthe absorbers essentially \"move-in\" to the newly-ionized regions.\nHowever, inside those large-scale regions, absorbers will preferentially be located in overdensities, i.e. filaments (see also Fig. 8).\nThese trends can also be seen more quantitatively in Fig. 5,\nwhere we plot the cross-correlation of the halo and absorber fields\nfor x\u0304HI = 0.72, 0.45, 0.18 and 0, left to right. The halo field is\ncomputed on the same resolution, 2003 grid, with cells containing\nhalos flagged as '1', and those not containing halos flagged as '0'.\nWe see that early in reionization, when the HII regions are smaller\nthan the mfp, there is only a positive correlation between the halos\nand absorbers. This is understandable since by definition absorbers\nmust reside inside HII regions, and on these relatively small scales,\nthey both correlate to the density field. However, as the HII regions\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\ngrow, the large-scale fluctuations in the UVB become important in\ndetermining the absorber locations. Absorbers show an increasing\npreference for the newly ionized regions distant from the ionizing\nsources where the UVB is weak. This manifests itself through the\nincreasingly negative large-scale cross-correlation as reionization\nprogresses.\nIn Fig. 6, we plot the distribution of the absorption systems\nin the (\u03b4,fN ) plane. The black, blue and red surfaces enclose 99%,\n95% and 68% of the absorber population, respectively. The upper\n(lower) panels correspond to \u03bb = 10 (20) Mpc. This figure clearly\nshows the degeneracy between the density and ionizing flux, as the\ncontours stretch from the lower left to the upper right, following\n\u03c4 \u221d (\u03b4 + 1)2 /f isocontours. The isocontours are flatter for higher\nvalues of the mfp due to our choice of normalization of the ionizing flux, which means that the same fN corresponds to a higher\nunnormalized value of the UVB for \u03bb = 20 Mpc than for \u03bb = 10\nMpc8 .\nFig. 6 is further confirmation of our narrative above. Early in\nreionization, the highly biased nature of the ionizing sources implies that ionized regions generally trace large-scale overdensities,\ni.e. reionization is inside-out on large scales (Trac & Cen 2007;\nMcQuinn et al. 2007a; Zahn et al. 2010). Within these large-scale\nregions, it is the density field9 which determines whether a cell\nwill host absorption systems; hence the contours in the left panels of Fig. 6 are fairly steep showing insensitivity to the UVB. As\nthe HII regions grow to include large-scale voids, it is the UVB\nwhich increasingly determines whether a cell will host absorption\n\n8\n\nNote that our normalized flux, fN from eq. (2), is normalized to the\nmean value post reionization, for each mfp. Therefore the same fN values\ncorrespond to the same unnormalized ionizing flux for each x\u0304HI , but are\ndifferent for different values of \u03bb. The mean value of the UVB is of course\nhigher for higher values of the mfp.\n9 Note that the absorber densities in the figure are much more modest (of\norder unity) than in the post-reionization models of MHR00. MHR00 studied self-shielded systems at lower redshifts, z = 2\u20134. At redshift z = 10,\nthe mean density of the Universe is an order of magnitude greater, and the\nIGM can self-shield at much smaller overdensities since \u03c4 \u221d \u22062 . Also,\nwe study much smaller mean free paths, which effectively means that the\nUVBs that we consider are much weaker, and absorbers are more common. Finally, our semi-numerical simulations are at a lower resolution, so\nwe have less small-scale power than MHR00. We remind the reader that\nour procedure flags the locations of the absorbers but does not necessarily\nrequire that the absorbers themselves fill the entire cell.\n\n\f8\n\nD.

As a\nconsequence, the absorbers \"move-into\" the filaments of the newlyionized large-scale underdense regions. This can be seen as the shift\nin the contours towards higher density cells. Note that cells occupying the lower right quadrant of the figure still host absorbers, but\nthat region of parameter space is too rare to be enclosed by the 99%\ncontour.\nAlthough a direct comparison with Choudhury et al. (2009) is\ndifficult since they do not explicitly distinguish between the neutral IGM outside HII regions and the absorbers inside HII regions,\nthey find a similar qualitative trend of the neutral IGM remaining in increasingly overdense regions as reionization progresses.\nHowever, we do not find evidence for their dual peak in the density PDF of the neutral IGM at \u03b4 > 0. Although the less-dense\nneutral regions found by Choudhury et al. (2009) could represent\nthe neutral IGM outside HII regions, they still obtain significant\nneutral cells with \u03b4 > 0, which is not consistent with the insideout nature of reionization on large-scales. The parameter studies\nby McQuinn et al. (2007a) suggest that absorbers have a small im-\n\npact on reionization morphology, and that the inside-out nature of\nreionization on large-scales is a robust result. As already explained,\nthis was one of the reasons we separately compute the reionization\nmorphology and absorber locations, unlike the analytic procedure\nof Choudhury et al. (2009) which combines the two calculations.\nWe stress that when the UVB is inhomogeneous, the distribution of\nabsorbers is best represented in the (\u03b4,fN ) plane, and not marginalized over just the density.\nThe above-mentioned trends can also be seen Table 1, where\nwe show the fraction of cells containing absorbers, normalized by\nthe HII filling factor (xaN ), and unnormalized (xa ). Indeed the\nabundance of absorption systems inside the ionized IGM, shown by\nxaN is much higher in the early stages of reionization. Given that\nreionization is inside-out on large scales, this lends further confirmation that the density field dominates absorber locations early in\nreionization.\nIn Fig. 7, we show the power spectra of our various fields. The\ndimensionless power spectrum of field i is taken to be \u22062i (k) =\nk3 /(2\u03c0 2 V ) h|\u03b4i (k)|2 ik , where \u03b4i (x) is the dimensionless fluctuc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\n\fThe distribution of absorbers\nxHI\n\n\u03bb/Mpc\n\nxaN\n\nxa\n\n0.72\n\n10\n20\n\n0.22\n0.27\n\n0.06\n0.08\n\n0.45\n\n10\n20\n\n0.14\n0.14\n\n0.08\n0.08\n\n0.18\n\n10\n20\n\n0.09\n0.05\n\n0.08\n0.04\n\n0\n\n10\n20\n\n0.03\n0.02\n\n0.03\n0.02\n\n9\n\nTable 1.

The top panels correspond to the density and the\nUVB. The bottom panels correspond to the absorber power spectra\nat x\u0304HI = 0.72, 0.45, 0.18 and 0, left to right, with \u03bb = 10 (20) Mpc\nshown with the blue solid (red dashed) curve.\nSince absorbers strongly correlate with the density field on\nsmall scales, we would expect their small-scale power spectrum to\nroughly follow the density power spectrum, with some bias. On\nlarge scales however, the absorbers anti-correlate with the flux (and\ndensity) fields. Therefore, their large-scale power should follow the\nUVB power spectrum, once HII bubbles have grown large enough\nto allow the absorbers to populate these modes. We see that these\ntrends are indeed present in the power spectra in Fig. 7. There is a\ndip in the absorber power spectrum between these two limits where\nthe absorbers transition from being correlated to the density field\non small scales to being anti-correlated on larger scales.\nDifferences in the absorber power spectra of our two mfp models only start emerging when the HII bubbles grow large enough to\nsurpass the mfp (the mean HII bubble scale10 is shown with the\nblack vertical line in Fig. 7). The \u03bb = 20 Mpc curves are in general higher during reionization, since there are fewer absorbers, and\nso the fractional offsets shown as the power spectra in Fig. 7 are\nhigher. When shown in dimensional units (scaled by the squared\nmean signal), a smaller mfp does have more power, as we shall see\nin \u00a7 4.3.\nUnfortunately, our simulation box is only 100 Mpc on a side,\nwhich is only a few times the mfp. Hence, it is difficult to fully isolate the impact of \u03bb from the absorber power spectra. To gain further insight, we turn to an analytic model for the UVB power spectra. Mesinger & Furlanetto (2009) have shown that the UVB power\nspectra can be predicted using an analogy of the \"halo model\", i.e.\nas the sum of two terms, one arising from correlations within a single source's 1/r 2 envelope, and one arising from correlations between the locations of two sources (Scherrer & Bertschinger 1991;\nCooray & Sheth 2002). The large-scale power corresponds to the\ntwo-source term, which traces the linear matter power spectrum on\nlarge scales times the bias, before being truncated at k >\n\u223c 1/\u03bb. We\nplot this two source term as the magenta curves in the flux panel\nof Fig. 7. The analytic model confirms that the \u03bb = 10 and 20\nMpc curves indeed do converge on large scales. The peak and drop\nat k >\n\u223c 1/\u03bb (demarcated by the blue and red vertical lines) is also\nseen in the absorber power spectra at x\u0304HI = 0. The detection of\n\nthis feature would be a novel measurement of the ionizing photon mean free path, valid even if the mfp was not dominated by\nthe self-shielded absorbers themselves. We defer a detailed analytic treatment of the absorber power spectra, including cross- and\nhigher-order terms, to future work.\n\n4.3 Impact of the Absorbers on the 21-cm Signal\nSome of the most important and timely observations of the epoch\nof reionization will come in the form of the redshifted 21-cm\nline of neutral hydrogen. Several interferometer telescopes are\nscheduled to become active in the near future, including the\nMileura Wide Field Array (MWA; Bowman et al. 2005)11 , the\nLow Frequency Array (LOFAR; Harker et al. 2010)12 , the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT; Pen et al. 2008), the\nPrecision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER;\nParsons & PAPER Team 2009), and eventually the Square Kilometer Array (SKA)13 . The neutral hydrogen of the absorbers could\nhave a significant impact on the interpretation of the reionization\nsignal, as suggested by Choudhury et al. (2009). Here we investigate this signal in our models. Note again that we do not explicitly\n4\nfocus on the HI content of the ionizing galaxies with Tvir >\n\u223c 10\nK, as in Wyithe et al. (2009a).\nThe offset of the 21-cm brightness temperature from the CMB\ntemperature along a line of sight (LOS) at observed frequency \u03bd can\nbe written as (c.f. Furlanetto et al. 2006b):\n\u03b4Tb (x, z)\n\u2248 9(1 + z)1/2 xHI (x, z)[1 + \u03b4nl (x, z)] ,\nmK\n\nwhere we have chosen to ignore peculiar velocity effects, shown\nto have a relatively minor impact during the advanced stages of\nreionization (McQuinn et al. 2006, MF07, Mesinger et al. 2010).\nEquation (7) further assumes that the spin temperature of the IGM\nhas been heated well past the CMB temperature, which seems\nlikely during the bulk of reionization for fiducial astrophysical\nmodels (e.g. Pritchard & Furlanetto 2006; Furlanetto et al. 2006b;\nChen & Miralda-Escud\u00e9 2008; Santos et al. 2008; Baek et al.\n2009; Mesinger et al. 2010).\nSlices through our 21-cm brightness temperature boxes are\nshown in Fig. 8, for x\u0304HI = 0.72, 0.45, 0.18 and 0 (left to right) and\n\u03bb = 10 (upper panels) and 20 Mpc (lower panels).

The black dot-dashed curve corresponds to the 21-cm power neglecting absorption systems.\n\nNeglecting absorbers, this signal progresses along the familiar\nstory lines. Before reionization, the 21-cm power spectrum is dominated by the matter power spectrum. Reionization carves out dark\nregions in the 21-cm signal, which initially (x\u0304HI >\n\u223c 0.9) steepen the\npower spectrum as the first regions to be ionized are the small-scale\noverdensities, equilibrating power on large scales (McQuinn et al.\n2007a). As the HII regions grow, the power spectrum is governed\nby HII morphology, with a \"shoulder\" feature corresponding to the\nbubble scale progressing from small to large scales, and stalling at\nthe mfp scale (Mesinger et al. 2010).\nIncluding absorbers complicates this story. Most notably, they\ndrive small-scale power. Therefore the 21-cm power spectrum in\u22121\ncreases at small scales (k >\n\u223c 1 Mpc ) where the HII bubbles\nwould have otherwise damped the fluctuations. On moderate scales\n\u22121\n<\n(0.5 Mpc\u22121 <\n\u223c k \u223c 1 Mpc ), the absorbers actually smooth the\nfluctuations somewhat by decreasing the contrast between the ionized and neutral regions. Once the HII regions grow to be larger\nthan the mfp, the absorber distribution (sourced by the UVB) adds\nto the large-scale power.\nAgain we note that the power spectrum is not sensitive to the\nmfp until the later stages of reionization. The modulation of the\nUVB by a smaller mfp and the increased number density of absorbers result in a stronger signal of the \u03bb = 10 Mpc model than\nthe 20 Mpc model.\nAs noted by Choudhury et al. (2009), the IGM absorbers\ncan contribute to a sizable 21-cm signal (though see Lidz et al.\n2008) during and post-reionization (more so than galactic HI; e.g.\nWyithe et al. 2009a). Overall, we find a smaller 21-cm signal than\nChoudhury et al. (2009), who also do not find the non-monotonic\nbehavior of the power spectrum noted above. If indeed the 21-cm\nsignal from absorbers is strong even post-reionization, this could\nbias the calibration of upcoming interferometers.\nWe remind the reader that our procedure assigns all of the gas\ninside the absorber's simulation cell as being fully neutral. This\nneed not be the case, as mentioned previously. Indeed, low redshift\nLLSs are found to be mostly ionized (e.g. P\u00e9roux et al. 2003b),\nalthough absorption systems during the reionization epoch likely\nhave different properties. Nevertheless, readers should note that the\nabsorbers could contribute less to the 21-cm signal than shown\nhere15 . In fact, if we allow the absorber host cells to be partially\nionized, a residual HI fraction of only 10\u22123 \u2013 10\u22122 is sufficient\n\n15 In the previous sections we focus on the spatial distribution of absorbers, which should be robust to these uncertainties. Furthermore, the dimensionless power spectra in Fig. 7 is less sensitive to subgrid structure,\nsince the fractional variation, \u03b4 \u2261 \u03c1/\u03c1\u0304 \u2212 1 is unchanged for a constant\nabsorber ionization fraction.\n\nc 2008 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201313\n\nto achieve a lyman limit optical depth of \u03c4 \u223c 1. This would decrease the absorber contribution to the 21-cm power spectrum by\nroughly the same amount, making it negligible. Partially ionized\nhigh-z absorbers might be more common if, for example, higher\nenergy photons can efficiently penetrate the absorbers. Regardless\nof what exactly is the neutral fraction of the absorber cells, the qualitative trends in the 21cm power spectrum discussed in this section\nshould remain unchanged.\n\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nLyman-limit absorption systems can play many important roles\nduring and after cosmological reionization: as photon sinks, they\ncan delay reionization; they can regulate the UVB; they can affect\nthe morphology of reionization; they can be responsible for a nonnegligible 21-cm signal. Unfortunately, due to the prohibitively\nlarge dynamic range required, it is impossible to self-consistently\ninclude these systems in cosmological simulations.\nIn this paper, we focus on predicting the spatial distributions\nof absorbers during and following reionization. We use the efficient\nsemi-numerical simulation code, DexM, to generate density, halo,\nionization, and UVB fields. We then use a simple optical depth criterion to identify the simulation cells expected to host Lyman-limit\nabsorption systems. We self-calibrate the resulting number of absorbers to the mfp of the UVB, and present results at a given mfp\nand neutral hydrogen fraction. Our approach is fairly robust to uncertainties such as missing subgrid structure.\nWe find that absorbers are strongly correlated with the density\nfield on small scales. However, on large-scales the absorbers instead are strongly anti-correlated with the UVB, once HII bubbles\ngrow enough to allow absorbers to populate these modes. Therefore we caution that using only a density criterion when assigning LLSs to cosmological simulations in fact neglects large-scale\nmodes sourced by UVB fluctuations.\nOur ionization field algorithm assumes that absorbers do not\nhave a large impact on reionization morphology (McQuinn et al.\n2007a). As such, reionization in our simulations proceeds in an\n\"inside-out\" fashion on large scales. Early in reionization, when the\nHII bubbles are small, the density field regulates the locations of absorbers. As HII bubbles expand into the large-scale underdensities,\nthe absorbers tend to preferentially populate the overdensities (i.e.\nfilaments) of the recently-ionized IGM. Therefore the absorbers effectively huddle around the edges of the HII regions.\nIf the absorbers are indeed preferentially found on the outskirts of HII bubbles, the reionization could effectively stall in the\nlate stages. Reionization of the remaining HI regions might have to\nwait until the absorbers get photo-evaporated by the relatively faint\n\n\f12\n\nD. Crociani et al.\n\nUVB at the edges of the HII regions (e.g. Furlanetto & Mesinger\n2009). Alternately, new ionizing sources could reionize the remaining HI regions from the inside. Depending on the nature of the absorption systems (Iliev et al. 2005b), the time-scales of both processes could be fairly long: of order \u2206z \u223c 1.\nIf high-z absorbers are significantly neutral, they may also\n\u22121\ndominate the small-scale (k >\n\u223c 1 Mpc ) 21-cm power during and\nafter reionization. They smooth the contrast on moderate scales,\nand once the HII regions surpass the mfp, the absorbers add to the\nlarge-scale 21-cm power. Since our procedure assumes all of the\ngas inside a simulation cell is neutral, our quantitative estimates\nof the absorber contribution to the 21-cm signal can be viewed as\nupper limits. However, the qualitative trends should be robust.\nOur results should prove useful in interpreting future observations of the reionization epoch. We also plan to extend our analysis\nto HeII reionization, where the sizable inhomogeneity of the UVB\n(Dixon & Furlanetto 2009; McQuinn et al. 2009) will have an even\nmore pronounced impact on HeII Lyman-limit absorption systems.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Matt McQuinn and Adam Lidz for insightful comments\non a draft version of this paper.
