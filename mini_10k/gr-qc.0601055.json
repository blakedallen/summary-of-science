Pioneer\n10 was launched in March 1972; Pioneer 11 followed it in April 1973. After the encounters with\nJupiter and Saturn, both Pioneer spacecraft continued to explore the outer regions of the Solar\nSystem following nearly ecliptical hyperbolic paths in opposite directions. The last successful\ncommunication with Pioneer 10 occurred in April 2002, at nearly 70 AU from our planet, while\nthe last scientific observations were returned by Pioneer 11 in September 1995 when it was at\napproximately 40 AU from the Earth. The last attempt to communicate with Pioneer 10 was\nmade on March 2006, but without success [1]. The so-called Pioneer anomaly consists in an\nanomalous constant and uniform acceleration directed towards the Sun of (8.74 \u00b1 1.33) \u00d7 10\u221210\nm s\u22122 found in the data of both spacecraft from the moment when they passed the threshold\nof 20 AU [2, 3, 4]. Various attempts to explain this feature in terms of known physical and\nengineering effects have been done, but without success; the nature of the Pioneer anomaly is,\n1\n\n\fat present, still unexplained. It is not clear if the anomaly is due to some internal systematic,\nas suggested, e.g., in [5], or has an external origin. Dedicated space missions have recently been\nproposed [6, 7], while the authors of [8] put forth two non-dedicated scenarios involving either\na planetary exploration mission to the outer Solar System or a piggy-backed micro satellite to\nbe launched toward Saturn or Jupiter.\nIn this paper we propose to analyze some aspects of the problem of the Pioneer anomaly. In\nparticular, we will investigate the possibility that an external, unknown constant and uniform\nforce field inducing an acceleration of 8.74 \u00d7 10\u221210 m s\u22122 on a test particle is present in the outer\nregions of the Solar System within 20-40 AU. The outline of our approach is the following.\nLet us consider a constant and uniform acceleration radially directed towards the Sun and\nof very small magnitude so that it can be treated with the usual perturbative approaches; we\nwill deal with it from a purely phenomenological point of view, without making any speculation\nabout its origin. For a review of many proposed mechanisms involving possible 'new' physics,\nsee [9] and references therein. What is its impact on the orbital motion of the planets of the\nSolar System whose semimajor axis is larger than 20 AU like Uranus, Neptune and Pluto? it\nshould be noted that, at present there are no data supporting a more gradual onset of such\nan anomalous effect, and in the framework of this simplified model such planets, due to their\nrelatively small eccentricities (eUranus = 0.047, eNeptune = 0.008 and ePluto = 0.248), would be\nacted upon by the anomalous acceleration in all portions of their orbits.\nAn analogous approach was recently followed by the authors of [10]. Contrary to us, they\ndiscard the possibility of using the major planets of the outer Solar System. The focus of [10]\nis on some selected minor bodies characterized by large semimajor axes and eccentricities like\nsome unusual minor bodies, Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and Centaurs. However, such\nobjects are not constantly under the action of the hypothetical anomalous acceleration under\ninvestigation because of their highly eccentric orbits (0.620 < e < 0.947). According to the\nauthors of [10], a relatively low-cost future astrometric campaign should resolve the problem\nwithin the next twenty years. A different position about the outer planets can be found in [8].\nAnother recent paper in which a comparison between planetary observations and a theoretically\nderived quantity related to the Pioneer anomaly is attempted yielding similar conclusions is [11].\nIn our paper we first work out, both analytically and numerically, the orbital perturbations\ninduced by a disturbing acceleration like the Pioneer one on the Keplerian orbital elements\nof a planet. We find that the semimajor axis, the eccentricity, the perihelion and the mean\nanomaly of a test particle are affected by short-periods signatures and the perihelion and the\nmean anomaly undergo also long-period, secular effects. Then, numerical simulations of the\ntemporal evolutions of the directly observable right ascensions and declinations of the planets\ninduced by a Pioneer-like acceleration are performed. Contrary to the position of the authors\nof [10] and in according to the conclusions of [8, 11], it turns out that the predicted anomalous\neffects of this kind would be sufficiently large to be well detected with the present-day level of\naccuracy in planetary orbit determination [13], even by considering errors considerably larger\nthan those released. Their absence tell us that in the outer region of the Solar System within\n20-40 AU there is no any unknown force field, with the characteristics of that experienced by\nthe Pioneer spacecraft, which affects the motion of the major planets.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe Gauss rate equations\n\nThe Gauss equations for the variations of the semimajor axis a, the eccentricity e, the inclination\ni, the longitude of the ascending node \u03a9, the argument of pericentre \u03c9 and the mean anomaly\nM of a test particle of mass m in the gravitational field of a body M can be derived quite\ngenerally from [14]\n\u03bc\n(1)\nr\u0308 + 3 r = A,\nr\nwhere \u03bc = G(M + m) and r = r m \u2212 r M .

As can be noted from eqs. (4)-(5), the inclination and the node are\nnot perturbed by such a perturbing acceleration.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nThe orbital effects induced by a constant radial acceleration\nAnalytical calculation\n\nThe ratio of the Pioneer anomalous acceleration to the Newtonian monopole term ranges from\n5\u00d710\u22125 to 2\u00d710\u22124 in the region 20-40 AU, so that eqs. (2)-(7) can be treated in the perturbative\nway. A treatment of the effects of a constant radial acceleration of arbitrary magnitude in the\ntwo-body problem can be found in [15, 16].\nThe right-hand-sides of eqs. (2)-(7) have to be evaluated on the unperturbed Keplerian\nellipse. The secular effects can be obtained by averaging over one orbital period the right-handsides of eqs. (2)-(7).\n\n3\n\n\fThe integration of eqs. (2)-(7) is easier if the eccentric anomaly E, defined as M = E\u2212e sin E,\nis used instead of the true anomaly f .

They amount to tens and hundreds of arcseconds/century\n(\u2032\u2032 cy\u22121 ). In regard to their detection, it must be noted that the orbital periods of the investigated planets, which are 84 years for Uranus, 164 years for Neptune and 248 years for Pluto, are\ncomparable or larger than the time span in which accurate observations were collected. Thus,\nit is not yet possible to single out orbital effects averaged over one full orbital revolution for\nNeptune and Pluto.\nIn Table 2, which reproduces Table 4 obtained by E.V. Pitjeva in [13] by processing almost\none century of data of various kinds with the latest EPM2004 ephemerides released by the\nInstitute of Applied Astronomy of Russian Academy of Sciences, the formal standard deviations\nof the orbital elements of the nine major planets of the Solar System are reported. The optical\nobservations used for Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are 23612 and cover 90 years from 1913\n(1914 for Pluto) to 2003 (see Table 3 of [13]). It turns out from Table 2 that the accuracy in\ndetermining the perihelia and mean longitudes of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be largely\nadequate to see so huge anomalous signatures, even if we consider that realistic errors could\nbe ten-thirty times larger. Indeed, from the formal results of Table 2 we have uncertainties of\n0.1\u2032\u2032 , 2\u2032\u2032 and 0.3\u2032\u2032 for the perihelia of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, respectively; if we multiply\nthem by a factor 30 we get 3\u2032\u2032 , 60\u2032\u2032 and 9\u2032\u2032 , respectively while the anomalous perihelion shifts\nover 90 years would amount to 75.1\u2032\u2032 , 93\u2032\u2032 and 104.6\u2032\u2032 , respectively. In the case of the mean\nlongitudes, the formal uncertainties amount to 0.008\u2032\u2032 , 0.035\u2032\u2032 and 0.079\u2032\u2032 , respectively which\nbecome 0.2\u2032\u2032 , 1\u2032\u2032 and 2\u2032\u2032 if rescaled by a factor 30; the anomalous shifts on \u03bb would be 150.6\u2032\u2032 ,\n188.5\u2032\u2032 and 217.7\u2032\u2032 , p\nrespectively. Note also that the systematic errors in the Keplerian mean\nmotions \u03b4n = (3/2) GM/a5 \u03b4a due to the (formal) uncertainties in the semimajor axis a amount\nto 0.03 \u2032\u2032 cy\u22121 , 0.1\u2032\u2032 cy\u22121 and 0.4\u2032\u2032 cy\u22121 only: even re-scaled by a factor 30, they remain well\nsmaller than the anomalous shifts. The impact of the mismodelling in solar GM , assumed\n\u03b4(GM ) = 8\u00d7109 m3 s\u22122 (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/astro constants.html), on the mean longitudes\nis even smaller.\nThe very long orbital periods of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto make also the short-period signals of interest, in principle, because they would resemble polynomial signals over observational\ntime spans like those currently available. This could be useful especially for the semimajor axis\nand the eccentricity which do not exhibit secular rates. In Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and 4\nwe plot the total, i.e. linear (when present) and sinusoidal, integrated shifts of eqs. (12)-(14)\nand eq. (18) for the semimajor axis, the eccentricity, the perihelion and the mean longitude,\nrespectively over 90 years. In Table 3 we quote the amplitudes A of the short-period signals for\nUranus, Neptune and Pluto. Anomalous signatures of such size would be detectable as well, but\nnothing like that is mentioned in Pitjeva's work.\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nThe orbital effects induced by a constant radial acceleration:\nnumerical simulations and comparison with data\n\nThe Keplerian orbital elements are not directly measured quantities: they are related to data\nin an indirect way. For the outer planets the true observables are the right ascension \u03b1 and the\ndeclination \u03b4. In Figure 2 of [13] there are the observational residuals of \u03b1 cos \u03b4 and \u03b4 for Uranus,\nNeptune and Pluto from 1913 to 2004. In order to make a direct comparison with them, in this\nSection we numerically compute theoretical Pioneer-No Pioneer (P-NP) residuals for the same\nquantities over the same time span.\nThe first step of this process consists in a direct integration of the gravitational equations in\nCartesian rectangular coordinates. A number of software packages to perform this goal are freely\navailable on the Internet; between them there are OrbFit (http://newton.dm.unipi.it/orbfit/),\nORSA (Orbit Reconstruction, Simulation and Analysis, http://orsa.sourceforge.net/, by\nP. Tricarico), and Mercury [17]. The last one has been chosen because it has the simplest use\nand allows to introduce without difficulty user-defined perturbing forces, such the Pioneer one.\nIt is introduced through the definition of the corresponding acceleration, whose components in\nx, y and z in an heliocentric frame are given. In this implementation this acceleration has been\nconsidered only for heliocentric distances greater then 15.0 AU, so to include the whole orbit of\nUranus, totally excluding Saturn. This package uses the following integration methods\n\u2022 second order mixed-variable symplectic\n\u2022 Bulirsh-Stoer (general)\n\u2022 Bulirsh-Stoer (conservative systems)\n\u2022 Radau 15th order\n\u2022 hybrid (symplectic / Bulirsh-Stoer)\nSince the pros and cons of a method depend to a certain extent on the specific problem to be\nsolved, a number of tests have been performed, using most of the proposed methods and various\ninitial conditions in order to choose the most suitable approach to our problem. performed form\nJD 2410000.5 to JD 2460000.5, for the nine planets As a result, the 15th order Everhart-Radau\nalgorithm has been chosen for the Pioneer problem and initial conditions at JD 2410000.5. The\noutput is in XY Z barycentric, with both integration and tabulation steps of 10.0 days. The\nXY Z coordinates of the Earth's center are obtained from ORSA. The right ascensions and\ndeclinations of the three planets have been obtained in the standard way (see e.g. [18]), and the\nresiduals in \u03b1 cos \u03b4 and \u03b4 have been plotted in Figures 5-10. As already noted, Figure 2 of [13]\nshows the observational residuals, in \u2032\u2032 , of \u03b1 cos \u03b4 and \u03b4 for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune\nand Pluto; the scale is \u00b15 \u2032\u2032 and no secular or semi-secular trends can be recognized by visual\ninspection. Our numerically produced P-NP residuals of Figures 5-10 can be straightforwardly\ncompared to the last three panels (from the bottom) of Figure 2 of [13] yielding a direct and\nunambiguous confrontation with the observations. As can be noted, the pattern which would\nbe induced by a Pioneer-like acceleration on the planetary motions is absent in the data.\n\n6\n\n\f5\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nIn this paper we have considered the orbital motions of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto to investigate, from a purely phenomenological point of view, if an anomalous force field inducing a\nconstant, uniform Sunward acceleration of 8.74 \u00d7 10\u221210 m s\u22122 , as that experienced by the Pioneer spacecraft, affects their motions which occur in the 20-40 AU region of the Solar System,\nwell within the range in which the Pioneer data show the anomalous signature. We have worked\nout both analytically and numerically the perturbations induced by such a disturbing acceleration on the Keplerian orbital elements and on the directly observable right ascensions and\ndeclinations of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. It turns out that there are long-period, secular rates\non the perihelion and the mean anomaly and short-period effects on the semimajor axis, the\neccentricity, the perihelion and the mean anomaly which map onto certain particular patterns\nof the right ascensions and declinations. Such anomalous signatures would be large enough to\nbe detected according to the present-day accuracy in orbit determination, but there is no trace\nof them in the currently available data. This result restricts the possible causes of the Pioneer\nanomaly to some unknown forces which violate the equivalence principle in a very strange way\nor to some non-gravitational mechanisms peculiar to the spacecraft.\n\nAcknowledgements\nL.I. gratefully thanks G.
