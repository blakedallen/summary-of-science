Introduction\nPolymer photovoltaics offer the promise of an inexpensive and mechanically robust alternative to\nestablished solar cell technologies. Recent progress has seen the establishment of manufacturing\napproaches [1] and improvement in both power conversion efficiency [2, 3] and stability [4, 5].\nDespite these gains there remain many unanswered questions regarding the composition and\nprecise mechanisms that govern the performance of these devices [6]. To date the primary\nresearch focus has been on improving power conversion efficiency, with significantly less\nattention on characterizing stability and understanding the mechanisms that limit the lifetime of\nthese materials [7]. Furthermore, the published work in this field typically does not present\nresults from experiments which sample from the large parameter space of materials and device\npreparation. Publication of the results and discussion of only the systems that simply follow\nempirical recipes for fullerene and polymer ratios and fabrication parameters is insufficient to\ndetermine the underlying mechanisms that influence device performance. In order to develop a\nmore robust methodology and process for evaluating solar cell composition and fabrication\nparameters as they affect device performance, we present coordinated results from transport and\noptical measurements of samples based on the electron donor Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)\n(P3HT). To elucidate the mechanisms that control efficiency and lifetime, we repeat these\nmeasurements on each sample over time scales of a few hours to weeks while changing only one\nparameter at a time. This effort is intended to produce a broader and more systematic data set.\n\n\fPrevious work has shown that the addition of functionalized fullerenes enhanced device lifetime\nfor devices based on Poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV)\nas the electron donor [8]. Our recent results both corroborate that conclusion and indicate an\nadditional improvement by varying the structure of the functionalized fullerene [9]. Specifically,\nwe have found significant lifetime improvements by using [6,6]-Phenyl C61 butyric acid\noctadecyl ester (PCBOD) in place of the commercially available electron acceptor PCBM.\nCoupled with this increase in device lifetime, however, is a reduction in power conversion\nefficiency. In this current study we have extended our results to the more commonly studied\nP3HT system. Fig. 1 compares the structure of PCBOD and the commonly used [6,6]-Phenyl\nC61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).\n\nIn order to compare both the PCBOD and PCBM systems, we have adopted the molar fraction x\nto describe the relative content of our polymer fullerene blends.\n\nx\uf03d\n\nm C 60 / MWC 60\nm C 60 / MW C 60 \uf02b m P 3 HT / MW P 3 HT\n\nwith MW denoting the molecular weight of each species and m denoting its mass. Given that the\ndegree of polymerization can vary, we use the molar mass of the P3HT monomer. In this\ndescription, a mole fraction of x=0.5 would represent a blend which has one C60 molecule per\nP3HT monomer. The standard widely used in the literature is equal weight concentrations of\n\n\fPCBM:P3HT, which corresponds to x = 0.16. While the equal-weight ratio might serve as a\nsimple starting point for initial experiments using new materials, it is at best cumbersome and\nperhaps even nonsensical when we compare fullerene-polymer blends using different fullerenes\nwith different molecular weights. It is well-established that the functionalized fullerene is the\nactive component in these additives, and the functionalization increases solubility to improve\ndevice processing [10]. In previous work [2, 9, 11-15] additional structural changes have been\nmade which dramatically change molecular weight. Our strong opinion is that we should be\nusing mole fraction to clearly establish the ratio of fundamental units: fullerene-to-monomer\nunits in the polymer. For our work, we want a direct comparison between the PCBM- and\nPCBOD-based devices that have some systematic link and make sense chemically; therefore we\nuse molar fraction.\n\nImportant gains in efficiency have been observed using C70-substituted PCBM [2]. However this\nmolecule is more than 10% heavier than PCBM. Although weight ratios can be converted, direct\ncomparison would be more straightforward if mole fraction were adopted. An example of the\nbeneficial use of mole fraction appears in models for the crystal structure of these blends that\nclearly depict one fullerene to one monomer [16]. This ratio represents a mole fraction of x=0.5\nwithin the domains and not the macroscopic value x=0.16 equivalent to the equal-weight recipe.\nThe use of mole fraction in that work significantly enhances the clarity of the results. The\ndifference in these values can be understood within the context of recent energy-filtered\ntransmission electron microscopy images which have revealed the P3HT-rich and PCBM-rich\ndomains within the active layers [17]. This result can accommodate both the crystalline model\n\n\f(x=0.5 locally) [16, 18] and other studies of the morphology and diffusion within these samples\n(x=0.16 globally) [6, 19, 20].\n\n2. Experimental\nSolution processed samples were prepared inside an inert-atmosphere glove box. Indium-tinoxide (ITO) pre-coated glass substrates were patterned, cleaned and then spin-coated with\npoly[3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene]:poly[styrenesulfonate] (PEDOT:PSS) and baked at 200 oC for\ntwo hours. The active layer blend of P3HT with either PCBM or PCBOD was then spin cast at\nroughly 1000 rpm from chlorobenzene solutions. Active-layer solution weight fractions were\nroughly 1.5%. We expect these parameters to produce active layer thicknesses of about 150 nm\nbased on previous experience [21], but we have not performed direct measurements on these\nsamples. Interestingly we do find that PCBOD-based samples at the same weight percent\nproduce optically thinner layers than those with PCBM. The result is perhaps expected given the\nhigher solubility of PCBOD in chlorobenzene. PCBM is the electron acceptor widely used in\npolymer photovoltaic measurements and was acquired commercially [22]. PCBOD was\nsynthesized in our laboratories from coupling [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid with octadecanol as\ndiscussed previously [9]. After spin casting, samples were annealed on a hot plate inside the\nglove box for one hour at temperatures between 40 and 340 oC. In some cases, samples were not\nannealed prior to further processing. During our initial experiments it was determined that the\nactual sample temperature during annealing was lower than that of the hot plate surface. In order\nto correct for this difference, we have calibrated the hot plate/sample system using a 0.25 mm\ntype-E thermocouple placed on the sample surface (top surface of the glass) during heating. We\n\n\ffound that sample temperatures were roughly 20 oC lower when the hotplate temperature was\nabout 150 oC and nearly 40 oC lower at 250 oC. Samples that were used for UV-vis\nspectroscopy studies were prepared by the same method, but microscope slides replaced the\npatterned ITO substrates and the samples were ready for measurement after spin-casting the\nactive layer and annealing. Samples to be used for electrical transport characterization were\ntransferred to a standard bell-jar evaporator system equipped with a quartz crystal thickness\nmonitor where they were finished by evaporating ~1 nm of LiF followed by 100 nm of Al to\nform the top electrodes. As the evaporator is not integrated into the glove box, samples were\ntransferred between the two using a vacuum tight vessel carrying dry nitrogen atmosphere. The\nelapsed time that samples were exposed to ambient air was typically under 5 minutes. A\nschematic of the transport sample structure is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nBoth electrical transport and spectroscopic measurements were conducted in ambient atmosphere\nimmediately after completing the sample preparation. Current-voltage (I-V) transport\ncharacteristics of the devices were measured alternately in darkness and illuminated by a PV\nMeasurements, Inc. Small-Area Class-B Solar Simulator. Automated transport data collection\nutilized a MATLAB controlled routine via an IEEE 488 Bus interfaced Keithley 2400\nSourceMeter. UV-vis measurements were performed using a Varian Cary 50 spectrometer.\nSamples were measured over periods of hours or days for both spectroscopic and transport\nexperiments. Illumination was used only during the actual measurements; otherwise the device\nremained in ambient but low light conditions. The laboratory temperature was controlled at 2326 oC with a relative humidity range of 50-70% (not directly controlled).\n\n\f3. Results and Discussion\nFig 2 shows a typical set of transport curves. I-V measurements are normally recorded in 10-30\nminute intervals depending on the apparent rate of change, and many interleaving curves were\nremoved from this figure for clarity. This particular sample was a PCBM blend, however\nPCBOD samples yielded similar results, albeit at lower current scales. The inset of this figure\nshows the calculated power conversion efficiency as a function of time \u03b7(t). As \u03b7(t) appears\nlinear in a semilog plot, it is apparent that it follows an exponential decay\n\n\uf068 (t ) \uf03d \uf068 (0) exp( \uf02dt / \uf074 ) ,\nwhere a characteristic (1/e) lifetime \uf074 can be derived from the slope (-1/\u03c4) [9]. Such a slope is\nshown in the Fig. 2 inset. In cases that \u03b7(t) does not strictly follow an exponential decay, we\nhave chosen to simply find the time at which \u03b7 drops to 1/e of its initial value. This approach\nallows us to derive a figure of merit with which to compare the lifetime of various sample\npreparations. Specifically, we occasionally observe samples that first improve in efficiency\nbefore the onset of degradation. In some cases these samples then decay exponentially and we\nreport both \uf074\uf020and 1/e time.\n\nFig. 3 presents results for PCBM:P3HT samples for two different blends x=0.16 (standard equal\nweight blend) and x=0.40 (the optimum result for the PCBOD samples to be discussed). The top\nframe shows the initial power conversion efficiency as a function of anneal temperature. The\nlower frame displays the degradation times for the corresponding samples. \uf074\uf020values as discussed\n\n\fabove are shown as open symbols and filled symbols denote 1/e times. These results do not\nappear to favor the x=0.16 samples with respect to power conversion efficiency, however the\ndevice lifetimes are clearly better for these samples when produced at the higher anneal\ntemperatures. It is also important to note that we have focused on systematic sample preparation\nfor these studies. We have not focused on optimizing PCBM:P3HT devices and as such we do\nnot obtain (or expect) state-of-the-art efficiencies.\n\nSince PCBOD:P3HT blend devices have not been previously reported in the literature and the\nstructure and molecular weight of PCBOD is significantly different than PCBM, it was necessary\nto determine reasonable blend and annealing parameters for making devices. Fig. 4 shows\nresults on unannealed samples using a range of stoichiometry. The same molar fraction blend as\nPCBM (x=0.16) showed rather poor results. By far the best efficiencies (roughly 0.1%) for asspun devices were produced by molar fractions near 0.4. Without more comprehensive testing, it\nis impossible to know whether this blend is also optimum for annealed samples, but that\nendeavor presents a dramatically larger parameter space.\n\nIn Fig 5 we show the effect of annealing on PCBOD:P3HT samples with x=0.4 as a function of\nanneal temperature. Again we show initial power conversion efficiency \u03b7(0) in the upper frame\nand the lifetime in the lower one. In comparing these results with those for PCBM:P3HT blends\nat x=0.16 in Fig. 3, we note that these latter samples have much higher efficiencies, but the\nPCBOD system still shows better lifetimes. In general, we see that the rate of degradation is\nlower for PCBOD samples while the PCBM devices show a higher efficiency. It is also worth\n\n\fnoting that for both fullerenes the degradation is typically exponential. This result is in contrast\nto earlier work using phenylenevinylene-based devices [9].\n\nAn important component of our research is the coordinated measurement of both transport and\nspectroscopic data for samples produced from the same blend solutions. Furthermore these\nexperiments extend to time dependences for both measurements as we focus on characterizing\ndevice degradation and investigating its mechanisms. Despite the large differences in power\nconversion efficiency and lifetime, previous studies show that UV-vis absorbance spectra vary\nlittle between annealed and unannealed samples [23]. However, spectral changes were not\nstudied over an extended length of time where differential measurements show significant\nchanges in our spectroscopic studies. We show that as samples degrade, the characteristic\nabsorbance spectra for unannealed and annealed samples evolve. In general we observe different\ncharacteristic times for different spectral peaks with unique signatures that distinguish the\nbehavior of the PCBM:P3HT and PCBOD:P3HT samples. PCBM:P3HT samples show\ndecreasing absorbance over time in the range of regioregular P3HT's maximum absorbance,\napproximately 450 to 600 nm [24]. The opposite is true for the PCBOD:P3HT blend. It is\nperhaps noteworthy that these trends were reversed in the MEH-PPV system studied previously\n[9].\nThe lower frames of Figs. 6 and 7 show examples of differential spectra for PCBM and PCBOD\nsamples respectively with vertical arrows showing the direction of change as time increases.\nEach line on the figures represents the difference between a measurement at specified time (t)\nand the initial measurement. Positive absorbance values indicate an increase in absorbance and\n\n\fnegative values indicate a decrease. The upper frames depict the initial and final raw spectra for\nthese samples.\n\nThin films composed of regioregular P3HT and PCBM absorb the most UV and visible light\nbetween 450 and 600 nm, a range which includes the maximum absorbance peaks of pure P3HT\nthin films [25]. Our UV-vis results for PCBM:P3HT samples are consistent with these literature\nvalues. PCBOD:P3HT thin films do not absorb most strongly in this range, but exhibit\nsignificant spectral changes within it. The time-dependent changes within this range suggest that\nthe polymer is changing absorptivity (and likewise device efficiency) over time, likely due to\nsome molecular reorganization. The following results focus solely on changes within the 450 to\n600 nm range.\n\nPCBM:P3HT samples (x=0.16, both unannealed and annealed) demonstrate time-dependent\nchanges in absorbance levels, but no red- or blue-shifts (Fig. 6). The absorbance at 550 nm\ndecreased, with the largest changes in samples annealed at temperatures up to 195 oC. Above 195\noC, the trend was less significant. This same trend was apparent, yet larger, in samples with\ngreater PCBM content (x=0.4).\n\nPCBOD:P3HT samples (x=0.4, annealed at 195 oC) showed red-shifts and an increase in\nabsorbance (Fig. 7). The spectra initially displayed a shoulder at 515 nm, but then a shoulder at\n550 nm developed and grew much larger than the 515 nm shoulder. This growth saturated after\n\n\fabout one week. All other PCBOD:P3HT samples (x=0.4) gave the same general trend, and the\nincrease in absorbance at 550 nm was more significant in unannealed samples. Negligible\nchanges occurred when samples were annealed past 218 oC, P3HT's melting point [26].\n\nIn order to derive values for characteristic times from the spectroscopic data, we use our previous\napproach [9]. Typically we see peaks in the time-dependent spectra which grow and saturate.\nSuch temporal behavior is often consistent with a saturating exponential. As such we can model\nthis behavior as\na b s ( t ) \uf03d a b s ( \uf0a5 )[1 \uf02d e x p ( \uf02d t / \uf074 )]\n\nwhere\n\na b s (\uf0a5 )\n\ndenotes the differential absorbance after long times (the saturated value). As\n\nbefore, in cases when the exponential saturation is not as easily fitted, we look for the [1-1/e]\nsaturation time to yield a characteristic time scale. Such a fit is shown in the inset of Fig. 7 for\nthe 551 nm peak. That peak grows with time and its value fits well to a saturating exponential\nwith final value 0.018 and time constant of 1.69 days (roughly 2400 minutes). Time constants\ngathered from various annealing temperatures and stoichiometries are shown in Fig. 8. The top\nfigure demonstrates that \u03c4 for PCBM:P3HT decreased with annealing temperature. In contrast, in\nthe bottom figure, PCBOD:P3HT samples yielded a maximum time constant at 195 oC.\n\nFrom these data, we have developed a model to explain device performance and spectral trends\nand the correlation of their time dependences. Increasing the ratio of fullerene (C60 or PCBM)\nadditives has been shown to decrease the film absorption between 450 and 600 nm [25]. This\n\n\frange relates to absorption maximum for P3HT and corresponds to a highly ordered, crystalline\nP3HT film which is required for efficient devices [24, 27]. Therefore, the weak absorbance in\nthis region of our PCBOD:P3HT films is a clear indication that these samples will have lower\nefficiency, as reflected in our device studies. This result suggests that the C18 chain on the\nPCBOD interferes with the crystallization of the P3HT. Although the relatively slow spectral\nred-shifts observed in PCBOD:P3HT might indicate some increase in polymer order [25], this\nchange is likely small compared to the disruption in the ordering caused by the chains. We\nobserve clear processing differences between the PCBM and PCBOD blends at the same weight\nconcentration of solution. We find that PCBOD's dramatically increased solubility makes the\nspin-cast films much thinner. In fact, samples which can barely be seen as coating the substrate\nwith the naked eye produce 0.1% efficient devices. The C18 seems to make the fullerene more\nmiscible with P3HT lowering its ability to organize in crystalline domains and it surfactant-like\nstructure decreases the viscosity of the solution resulting in thinner devices.\n\nThe annealing and performance experiments also follow an understandable and consistent trend.\nAs spun devices adopt a kinetically-frozen organization in the film and the two components\nseparate into phases and self-organize into local minima when the film is produced. [28]\nAnnealing allows for reordering of the components of the film and the predominant change is the\nincrease in the organization of the P3HT. PCBM has been shown to have significant mobility in\nP3HT films on annealing, [6] and it reasonable to predict that PCBOD would not have similar\nmobility. In fact, this was our working model to increase stability of devices: that the rate of\nPCBM-based device degradation was consistent with reorganization and both our current study\nand previous work [9] support this assertion. However, our current results show that at about the\n\n\fsame annealing temperature, PCBM devices are 10-fold more efficient, suggesting that fullerene\nmobility facilitates the P3HT reorganization to prepare a higher efficiency device. Therefore, in\nthe extreme cases as it relates to fullerene ester substitution (methyl vs. octadecyl), stability and\nefficiency constitute a trade-off in these device performance characteristics. Fortunately for our\nfuture work, there is great variability in the structure of the alkyl substituent still to be explored\nthat could enhance both performance and lifetime. Preliminary results from samples made with\n[6,6]-Phenyl C61 butyric acid octyl ester (PCBO) exhibit efficiencies that are improved by a\nfactor of four over the PCBOD results. We are exploring other fullerene esters that will be\ncompatible with or enhance the crystallization of P3HT and reinforce the required fullerene\ndomains to prepare efficient, robust devices.\n\n4. Conclusions\nUsing time dependent measurements of device efficiency and differential UV-vis spectroscopy,\nwe have demonstrated that varying the chain on the fullerene ester can affect the lifetime and\nefficiency of P3HT:fullerene based solar cells. Substituting octadecyl for methyl in the fullerene\nyielded 3-fold improved lifetimes, however the PCBOD devices were much thinner than PCBM\ndevices and 10-fold less efficient. Although the device thickness could be contributing to the\nlower efficiencies, is it clear from spectroscopic and device measurements that the C18 chain\naffects the crystallinity of the P3HT thereby lowering the transport properties of the devices.\nPreliminary studies have shown that a shorter octyl chain is only 5-fold less efficient, however\nthis system has not yet been optimized. Future work will continue to focus on wide ranging\npossibilities in ester chain variations that could lead to improved device lifetime and\n\n\fperformance characteristics. These simple changes in fullerene structure provide fundamental\nunderstanding of the device dynamics and if successful, the synthetic targets are amenable to\ncommercial applications.\n\n5.
