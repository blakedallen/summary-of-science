With a direct deposition technique, 1D structures\nhave been grown with sodium [1], chromium [2, 3, 4, 5],\naluminum [6], ytterbium [7] and iron [8]. Similarly, in a\ntwo-step lithography process, experiments have been performed with cesium [9], metastable argon [10], metastable\nneon [11], and metastable helium [12]. In a lithography\nprocess, a metal film is covered with an organic resist\nlayer, which is selectively damaged by the studied atoms.\nNext, the damaged molecules and their underlying metal\nlayer are removed with a cyanide etching solution. Although the lithography procedure requires an additional\nstep, it has the advantage that the pattern formation\ndoes not suffer from atomic diffusion in the growth process [13], and the structures have no pedestal.\nSo far, experiments with a 2D optical mask have been\nperformed by deposition of chromium atoms [14, 15].\nChromium is advantageous because a short wavelength\ncan be used (\u03bb = 426 nm) implying small structure sizes\nof 70 \u2013 80 nm. Disadvantage is the long exposure time\nand the inevitable pedestal in the structures. Also, atom\nlithography with cesium atoms and a holographic light\nmask has been reported, resulting in a line pattern with\na periodicity of 426 nm and a perpendicularly superposed\nline pattern with a 23.4 \u03bcm spacing [16]. We report on\nexperiments with a 2D optical mask using metastable helium atoms in a lithography procedure. The metastable\nhelium atom has a high internal energy (20 eV), and the\ndose of atoms required to affect a single resist molecule\nis therefore low [17]. This shortens the exposure time of\nthe samples to about eight minutes [12].\nThe optical mask is generated by interference of laser\nbeams that propagate perpendicularly to an atomic beam\n\naddress: Physikalisches Institut, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg,\nPhilosophenweg 12, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany\n\n\u2217 Present\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic view of the 2D intensity profiles for linearly polarized light, perpendicular to the plane of incidence\n(left-hand image) and circularly polarized light (right-hand\nimage). The mirrors are indicated by the gray rectangles.\nThe ratio of the wavelength of the light and the waist of the\nlaser beam is not to scale.\n\nwhich is directed towards the sample. A force is exerted\non the atom by the interaction of the induced atomic\ndipole moment with the electric field of the standing light\nwave. For a two-level atom, the optical potential of the\nstanding-wave light field can be written as [18]:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh\u0304\u2206\n\u03932\nI(~r)\nU (~r) =\n,\n(1)\nln 1 +\n2\nIsat \u03932 + 4\u22062\nwhere \u2206 is the detuning of the light from atomic resonance, I(~r) is the intensity of the light as a function of\nthe position ~r = (x, y, z), Isat is the saturation intensity\nof the optical transition, and \u0393 is the natural linewidth\nof the atomic transition. The dipole force experienced\nby the atom, corresponding to this optical potential, is\ngiven by:\n~ (~r).\nF~ (~r) = \u2212\u2207U\n\n(2)\n\nThe formation of a 2D optical mask is shown schematically in Figure 1. The incident light beam, traveling from\nright to left in the x-direction, is reflected at 45\u25e6 downward in the minus y-direction and retro-reflected by the\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic of the setup. Metastable helium atoms\nare produced in DC discharge source S and travel in the zdirection toward the sample. In the collimation section CS,\nlaser beams of diode laser DL allow for collimation of the\natomic beam in both x- and y-direction. Part of the diode\nlaser output (4%) is split of by beam splitter BS for spectroscopy. After reflection by polarizing beam splitter PBS1\nand double-passing discharge cell DC and quarter-wave plate\nQP1, the light is detected by photodiode PD1. The light\ntransmitted by PBS1 also passes PBS2 and is analyzed with\nFabry-Perot interferometer FPI and photodiode PD2. The\noptical standing-wave mask is made by the fiber laser FL. A\nsmall part of its beam reflected by PBS3 and also analyzed\nby FPI. For the standing wave the beam is first reflected\ndownward in the y-direction and retro-reflected by the mirror\nset SW, which is incorporated in the sample holder inside the\nvacuum chamber. After double-passing QP2, the light of the\nstanding wave is reflected by PBS3 and monitored with power\nmeter PM.\n\nlower mirror. In this mirror configuration a 2D interference pattern appears just in front of the upper mirror.\nThe atomic beam propagates in the z-direction through\nthe light field. The samples are placed in the light field\nin front of this upper mirror. The two images of Figure 1\nshow the intensity profile of the optical mask for the two\ndifferent polarizations used in the experiments. The lefthand image presents the pattern formed by a linearly polarized light beam, polarized perpendicular to the plane\nof incidence, i.e. in the z-direction. The right-hand image shows the intensity profile of a circularly polarized\nlight beam.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nThe experimental setup is shown in Figure 2 and is\nsimilar to the setup we described in a previous paper\n[12]. The helium atoms are transferred to the metastable\n2 3 S1 state in a DC helium discharge. The atomic beam\nis collimated in two dimensions using a curved wavefront\ntechnique with converging laser beams [19, 20]. After\nthe 2D-collimation the transverse velocity spread of the\n\natomic beam, defined as the full width at 1/e2 height,\nis decreased to 3 m/s and the centerline beam intensity\nis increased sixfold to 1.1 \u00d7 1010 s\u22121 mm\u22122 on the sample. The laser light for the collimation beams is provided\nby a 20 mW distributed Bragg reflector diode laser that\noperates at a wavelength of 1083 nm. With Doppler-free\nsaturation spectroscopy this laser is actively stabilized to\nthe 2 3 S1 \u2192 2 3 P2 transition of the helium atom.\nThe light for the 2D optical mask is obtained from a\nfiber laser also operating at a wavelength of 1083 nm\nand delivering a power of 800 mW. The frequency of\nthis light is 375 MHz blue detuned with respect to the\n2 3 S1 \u2192 2 3 P2 transition. The atoms are therefore repelled to the intensity nodes of the standing-wave light\nfield. The frequency stability of the fiber laser is monitored with respect to the locked diode laser with a FabryPerot interferometer (see Figure 2). The laser beam is\nfocused at the sample holder with a waist (defined as radius at 1/e2 of the intensity height) of 0.33 mm. The\ncorresponding Rayleigh length of 32 cm renders the actual focal point uncritical. The maximum saturation\nparameter is Imax /Isat = 107 , where Imax is the maximum intensity at the nodes of the standing wave and\nIsat = 0.17 mW/cm2 . The retro-reflected laser beam\noverlaps the incident beam path over a distance of 3.3 m,\nand is then reflected by polarizing beam splitter cube\nPBS3 and monitored with a power meter. The standingwave is aligned with respect to the sample position by\nfirst adjusting it such that it is not clipped by the sample and thus 100% of the light is back-reflected by the\nstanding-wave mirror onto the power meter. Next, the\nbeam is displaced by adjusting a micrometer translation\nstage (not indicated in figure 2) and clipped by the sample until only 50% of the light is back-reflected, which\nindicates that the sample position is at the center of the\nlaser beam. Final fine tuning is done with the translation\nstage in order to move the laser beam to the desired position with respect to the sample. The large distance over\nwhich both the incident and retro-reflected beam overlap\nreduces the misalignment angle of the laser beam to less\nthan 0.3 mrad. In the case where a linearly polarized\noptical mask is used, quarter-wave plate QP2 is removed\nafter alignment of the laser beam.\nThe samples are silicon substrates covered with a 1 nm\nchromium layer and a 30 nm gold layer. A hydrofobic resist layer of nonanethiol [CH3 (CH2 )8 SH] molecules allows\nto develop the samples in a simple wet-etching process\n[12, 17, 21]. After depositing a Self-Assembled Monolayer (SAM) of nonanethiol, the samples are exposed to\nthe atomic beam for eight minutes, corresponding to a\ndose of about one metastable atom per SAM molecule.\nIn a Penning ionization process, the SAM is locally damaged by the metastable atoms [22]. After exposure, the\nsamples are etched in a cyanide solution that dissolves\nthe damaged molecules, and the underlying gold film\n[12, 17, 21]. The etching time is also typically eight minutes. After etching, the sample topography is analyzed\nwith an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3: AFM surface scans of the samples. The images\ncover an area of 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm. The left-hand and righthand images show the results of the linearly polarized and the\ncircularly polarized optical mask respectively.\n\u221a The separation\nbetween both the lines and the dots is \u03bb/ 2 = 766 nm.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFigure 3 shows two 10 \u03bcm \u00d7 10 \u03bcm surface scans of the\nsamples taken with the AFM. The structure shown in\nthe left-hand image was created with a linearly polarized\noptical mask. The dark regions indicate the positions\nwhere the metastable helium atoms have hit the sample surface and where the gold layer has been removed\nin the etching process. The average structure height is\nabout\u221a 20 nm. The image shows a lattice of dots with\na \u03bb/ 2 = 766 nm separation. The holes have an average Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) diameter\nof 260 nm. The right-hand image pattern was produced\nwith a circularly polarized optical mask. The orientation of the lines is perpendicular\u221ato the mirror surface,\nand the line separation is also \u03bb/ 2, with an average diameter of 360 nm. A close look at the structures shows\na graininess typical for all lithography experiments with\ngold layers [9, 12, 17]. Zooming in on a part of the figure\nshows that the gold typically consists of approximately\n20 nm diameter grains.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFor a better understanding of the created structures,\ncalculations of both the optical potential of the light field\nand the expected atomic distributions on the samples\nhave been performed. Due to the magnetic degeneracy\nof the lower and upper states of the optical transition, the\npotential of Equation 1 is not strictly valid. In a more\naccurate approach, the actual (adiabatic) potentials have\nbeen calculated by diagonalizing the interaction with the\nlight field. However, the resulting potentials for the J =\n1 \u2192 J = 2 transition used here correspond closely to the\ntwo-level potential of Equation 1. Hence, for convenience\nthis potential has been used for the calculations.\nThe potentials of the optical masks corresponding to\nthe intensity profiles of Figure 1 are shown in Figure 4a\n\nFIG. 4: Calculations of the potential (a), the atomic distributions on the sample (b) and the experimental results (c) for a\ncircularly polarized light field (left-hand images) and linearly\npolarized light field (right-hand images). All images cover an\narea of 2\u03bb \u00d7 2\u03bb, with \u03bb the wavelength of the light.\n\nfor linearly polarized light (left-hand image) and circularly polarized light (right-hand image). The images\ncover an area of 2\u03bb \u00d7 2\u03bb, where \u03bb = 1083 nm is the wavelength of the optical transition. The gray-scale indicates\nthe height of the potential, where the lightest regions\ncorrespond to the areas where the potential is the highest. For both polarizations, numerical simulations have\nbeen performed on the atoms that travel through the 2D\nstanding-wave light field. These calculations were done\nusing the dipole force F~ (~r) from Equation 2 in a threedimensional model that calculates the atomic trajectories numerically. In a previous paper we have described\nthis model in detail [23]. The atomic distributions corresponding to the potential plots are shown in Figure 4b,\nwhere every black dot represents the position where an\natom has hit the sample. As an initial distribution, a\nlattice of 201 \u00d7 201 atoms is used, distributed homogeneously on a 4\u03bb \u00d7 4\u03bb grid. Both the longitudinal and\ntransverse velocity of every atom is picked randomly from\n\n\f4\na Gaussian velocity distribution that corresponds to the\nexperimental values. The calculations, simulations and\nmeasurements in Figure 4 were taken at a sample position of 100 \u03bcm behind the center of the laser beam, in\nthe downstream direction of the atomic beam. From Figure 4a and Figure 4b it is clear that the atoms are guided\nto the regions of the lowest potential, i.e., the dark regions of the potential plots. The calculated structure\nfor linearly polarized light (along the z-direction) shows\na grid\n\u221a structure of the atoms, with a line separation of\n\u03bb/ 2. For the circularly polarized light field, a dotted\npattern is \u221a\nformed, where the separation of two successive\ndots is \u03bb/ 2 at an angle of 45\u25e6 with the x-axis.\nFor comparison, the experimental results for both polarizations are shown in Figure 4c as well. These images\nare close-ups of a part (2\u03bb \u00d7 2\u03bb) of the images shown in\nFigure 3. The images with a linearly polarized light field\nare in agreement with the simulated atomic distribution\nshown in Figure 4b. The qualitative visual agreement between the patterns is confirmed by a 2D Fourier analysis\nof the distribution. The calculated diameter (FWHM)\nof the dots (along the x- and y-axis) is 170 nm, which is\nin agreement with the measured width of 260 nm. The\nbroadened feature size seen in the experimental results\ncan be attributed to the isotropic etch process, that removes the unprotected gold from all directions. The lack\nof visibility of the lines connecting the dots is probably\nbecause the dose of metastable atoms was too small to\ndamage the resist layer enough in those specific areas.\nA longer exposure time, however, will broaden the dots,\nsimilar to the 1D case [12].\nThe pattern formed with a circularly polarized light\nfield deviates strongly from the calculated structure. Instead of a lattice of dots, the experimental results show a\nline pattern orientated perpendicular to the upper standing-wave mirror surface. Despite calculations that take\ninto account a possible misalignment of the laser beam,\nan imperfect polarization state and/or intensity gradients of the beams due to imperfect mirrors, we can not\nexplain the observed pattern. Both mirrors for the 2D\noptical masks have been verified experimentally to have\na conservation of polarization better than 97%. Thorough examination of the samples with the AFM have\n\nshown that the line pattern seen in Figure 3 is clearly\nvisible in a large area of 300 \u03bcm \u00d7 300 \u03bcm. Outside this\narea the 1D standing wave dominates the interference\npattern, resulting in line structures with a separation of\n\u03bb/2, and indicating that the 2D structure is produced at\nthe center of the 2D light field. This \u221a\nis confirmed by the\nstructure direction and spacing (\u03bb/ 2), that can only\nbe explained from the atom having experienced the force\nof a 2D optical mask. Therefore the observed structures\nwith a circularly polarized light field remain unexplained.\n\n[1] G. Timp, R. E. Behringer, D. M. Tennant, J. E. Cunningham, M. Prentiss, and K. K. Berggren, Phys.

Calculations\ncan only partly explain the observed structures. With\na linearly polarized light field a lattice of holes with a\ndiameter (FWHM) of 260 nm is created. The structures\nobtained with a circularly polarized optical mask show\nlines in a direction perpendicular to the mirror surface\nwith a FWHM of 360 nm. The\n\u221a separation between both\nthe lines and the holes is \u03bb/ 2 = 766 nm. The structure size that may be written with 1083 nm light in a\n2D mask is determined by the wavelength of the light.\nStructures with a smaller periodicity and size are feasible when shorter wavelength light is used. In this respect\nthe 2 3 S1 \u2192 3 3 P2 transition is promising. Light at the\n\u03bb = 389 nm wavelength can be generated efficiently by\nfrequency doubling of a Ti:Sapphire laser [24]. The recent\nadvent of diode lasers at this wavelength is promising as\nwell. However, the problem with the 20 nm graininess of\nthe structures remains, and has to be solved when structures smaller then 20 nm are aimed for.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to E.W.J.M. van der Drift (DIMES\nNanofacility, The Netherlands) for providing the silicon\nwafers.
