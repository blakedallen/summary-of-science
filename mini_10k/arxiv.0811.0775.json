Several experiments have measured the \u03c0\u03c0 interaction at low\nenergy with a precision such that it is now possible to confront these predictions\nwith data: i) K + \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 e+ \u03bde decays [4\u20138], ii) the pionium lifetime, measured by\nthe DIRAC collaboration [9], iii) the cusp effect in K \u2192 3\u03c0 decays, investigated\nby the NA48/2 and KTeV collaborations [8, 10]. The experiments performed by\nthe NA48/2 collaboration have generated an impressive data basis, as a result of\n\n2\n\n\fwhich the matrix elements of K \u2192 3\u03c0 and of Ke4 decays can be determined with\nan unprecedented accuracy.\nThe theoretical predictions and the measurements are performed in two different settings: the predictions concern pure QCD, in the isospin symmetry limit\nmu = md , with photons absent \u2013 a paradise world. To be more precise, the convention is to choose the quark masses and the renormalization group invariant\nscale of QCD such that the pion and the kaon masses coincide with the values\nof the charged ones, and the pion decay constant is F\u03c0 = 92.4 MeV. [We do\nnot specify the masses of the heavy quarks, because in the present context, their\nprecise values do not matter.] On the other hand, experiments are all carried out\nin the presence of isospin breaking effects, generated by real and virtual photons,\nand by the mass difference of the up and down quarks: this is the real world, described by the Standard Model. We are thus faced with the problem to find the\nrelation between quantities measured in the real world, where isospin breaking\neffects are always present, and the predictions made in the paradise world. It is\nthe aim of the present article to provide this relation.\nIn early experiments [4], the effects of real and virtual photons were estimated\nby considering a simplified model for the weak interactions, and taking into account photon effects through minimal coupling, working at lowest nontrivial order\nin \u03b1QED . In analyses of NA48/2 data before spring 2007, real and virtual photon\neffects were treated in a factorized manner, applying the Coulomb factor and\nusing the program PHOTOS [11] \u2013 see Ref. [5] for details. It is clear that both\napproaches missed the effects generated by the pion and kaon mass differences,\nand by the quark mass difference md \u2212 mu . It turned out that these effects are\nquite spectacular [12\u201315]: when taken into account, all previous discrepancies\nbetween data and prediction for the scattering lengths disappear [3, 6\u20138]1 .\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we recall how Ke4 data are\nanalysed in the isospin symmetry limit, based on Watson's theorem, while section\n3 describes the framework in which we take isospin breaking effects into account.\nIn section 4 we investigate \u2013 for the case of (Lorentz) scalar pion form factors\n\u2013 the effect of isospin breaking mass differences using unitarity and analyticity\nalone. We illustrate the outcome of this investigation in section 5 with two explicit\nexamples in the framework of Quantum Field Theory, before we return to Ke4\ndecays in section 6, where we display the result for the changes in the phase of the\nform factors, and for the phase\u2013removed form factors themselves. These results\nallow us in section 7 to perform fits to Ke4 data, based on numerical solutions to\nRoy equations, and to determine in this manner experimental values for the \u03c0\u03c0\nscattering lengths. A comparison with related work available in the literature is\nprovided in the following section 8, while a summary and concluding remarks are\n1\n\nIn fact, the relevant expressions for the pertinent corrections are contained already in the\nearly works of Cuplov and Nehme [16], but they went, unfortunately, largely unnoticed in the\nliterature.\n\n3\n\n\fgiven in section 9. Appendix B contains proofs of the general statements made\non the low\u2013energy structure of phases and form factors in the main text. Finally,\nAppendix C contains material needed for the calculations of form factors in a\nnon-relativistic framework.\n\n2\n\nKe4 decays: isospin symmetry limit\n\nTo set notation and to explain the manner in which Ke4 decays allow one to measure \u03c0\u03c0 phase shifts, let us consider here the decays in the isospin symmetry limit\nmu = md , \u03b1QED =0. The matrix element for K + (p) \u2192 \u03c0 + (p1 )\u03c0 \u2212 (p2 )e+ (pe )\u03bde (p\u03bd )\nis\nGF \u22c6\n\u016b(p\u03bd )\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )v(pe )(V\u03bc \u2212 A\u03bc ),\nT = \u221a Vus\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the last factor denotes hadronic matrix elements of the strangeness changing (vector and axial vector) currents,\nV\u03bc \u2212 A\u03bc = h\u03c0 + (p1 )\u03c0 \u2212 (p2 ) out | (s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc u \u2212 s\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03b35 u) | K + (p)i .\n\n(2)\n\nIn the following, we concentrate on the matrix element of the axial vector current,\nbecause it carries information on the \u03c0\u03c0 final state interactions and, in particular,\non the \u03c0\u03c0 phase shifts. One decomposes A\u03bc into Lorentz scalars,\nA\u03bc = \u2212i\n\n1\n[(p1 + p2 )\u03bc F + (p1 \u2212 p2 )\u03bc G + (pe + p\u03bd )\u03bc R] .\nMK\n\n(3)\n\nThe form factors F, G, R are holomorphic functions of the three variables\ns = (p1 + p2 )2 , t = (p1 \u2212 p)2 , u = (p2 \u2212 p)2 .\n\n(4)\n\nSometimes, it is useful to use instead\ns = (p1 + p2 )2 , sl = (pe + p\u03bd )2 , cos \u03b8\u03c0 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b8\u03c0 is the angle of the \u03c0 + in the CM system of the two charged pions,\nwith respect to the dipion line of flight in the rest system of the kaon [17]. In the\nisospin symmetry limit, one identifies the \u03c0\u03c0 phase shifts in the matrix element in\na standard manner, by performing a partial wave expansion, and using unitarity\nand analyticity, although, in the present case, this is a slightly intricate endeavour\n[18]. It is useful to introduce a particular combination of form factors (we omit\nisospin indices),\nF1 = F +\n\n(MK2 \u2212 s \u2212 sl )\u03c3\ncos \u03b8\u03c0 G .\n\u03bb(MK2 , s, sl )1/2\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\fp\nHere, \u03c3 = 1 \u2212 4M\u03c02 /s, and \u03bb(x, y, z) is the triangle function. The form factor\nF1 has a simple partial wave expansion,\nX\nPk (cos \u03b8\u03c0 )fk (s, sl ) .\n(7)\nF1 =\nk\u22650\n\nFor fixed sl , the amplitudes fk are holomorphic2 in CLR (4M\u03c02 ). In the elastic\nregion, the form factors fk carry the \u03c0\u03c0 phase shifts in the pertinent isospin\nchannel [18]. For f0 and f1 , the relation is\nf0+ = e2i\u03b40 f0\u2212 , f1+ = e2i\u03b41 f1\u2212 ;\n\ns \u2208 [4M\u03c02 , 16M\u03c02 ] ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b40 (\u03b41 ) denotes the phase shift of the isospin zero S-wave (isospin one\nP-wave), and fn+ (fn\u2212 ) stands for the form factor evaluated above (below) the cut,\nfn\u00b1 = fn (s \u00b1 i\u01eb, sl ) .\n\n(9)\n\nThe phase\u2013removed form factor can be Taylor expanded at threshold. For the\nquantity f0 , the expansion reads\ns\n\u2212 1,\n(10)\ne\u2212i\u03b40 f0+ = c0 + c2 q 2 + O(q 4) , q 2 =\n4M\u03c02\nwith coefficients ci that depend on sl . Because the modulus squared |F1 |2 enters\nthe decay rate, one can measure the phase shift difference \u03b40 \u2212 \u03b41 in Ke4 decay\nexperiments. In the remaining part of this article, we investigate the manner in\nwhich the relations Eqs. (8,10) are modified in the presence of isospin symmetry\nbreaking effects, and how the analysis of Ke4 data must be modified in order to\ndetermine the \u03c0\u03c0 phase shifts.\nBefore proceeding, let us consider the form factors at one loop in chiral perturbation theory and verify that F1 indeed has the behaviour just discussed. For\nthis, we recall the pertinent effective Lagrangian\nF02\nhD\u03bc UD \u03bc U \u2020 + 2B0 M(U + U \u2020 )i ,\n(11)\n4\nwhere the covariant derivative D\u03bc U contains the external vector and axial vector\ncurrents, and M = diag(m\u0302, m\u0302, ms ). Some of the graphs that contribute at tree\u2013\nlevel and at one loop are displayed in figure 1.

There are many additional graphs at one\u2013loop order, not displayed in\nthe figure.\nHere, M\u03c0 (F0 ) denotes the pion mass (pion decay constant), at leading order in\nthe chiral expansion. The quantity H(s, sl ) is real in the interval of elastic \u03c0\u03c0\nscattering. It is now seen that f0 indeed has the property (8) at this order in the\nlow\u2013energy expansion, with\n\u03b40 =\n\n(2s \u2212 M\u03c02 )\n\u03c3.\n32\u03c0F02\n\n(14)\n\nThis is the phase shift of the isospin zero S-wave, in tree approximation. The\namplitude f1 has a very similar structure [19], containing the phase shift of the\nisospin one P-wave, again in tree approximation. Remark: To get the result\nEq. (14), we have used an expansion around the chiral limit mu = md = ms = 0,\nas a result of which the pertinent pion decay constant F0 in this limit appears.\nTo the order considered here, we may replace F0 by the pion decay constant F in\nthe chiral limit mu = md = 0, ms 6= 0. It seems to us that this is a more natural\nchoice when discussing the \u03c0\u03c0 phase shift, and we will, therefore, use F0 \u21d2 F in\nnumerical analyses in the rest of this article.\n\n3\n\nIsospin breaking: the framework\n\nThe relation (8) holds in the isospin symmetry limit. On the other hand, Ke4\ndecays happen to occur in the real world where md 6= mu , \u03b1QED 6= 0, as a result\nof which the relations Eq. (8) do not hold anymore. Here, we discuss how this\nsituation can be modelled in view of the already published analyses of Ke4 decays.\nIn early experiments [4], the effects of real and virtual photons were estimated by considering a simplified model for the weak interactions, and taking\n6\n\n\finto account photon effects through minimal coupling, working at lowest nontrivial order in \u03b1QED . In analyses of NA48/2 data before summer 2007, real and\nvirtual photon effects were treated in a factorized manner, applying the Coulomb\nfactor and using the program PHOTOS [11] \u2013 see Ref. [5] for details. It is clear\nthat both approaches missed the effects generated by the pion and kaon mass\ndifferences, and by the quark mass difference md \u2212 mu . These must thus be taken\ninto account separately. We assume that they can be evaluated in factorized form\nas well, and write symbolically in case of the NA48/2 analysis\nFull isospin breaking effects = Coulomb factor \u00d7 PHOTOS \u00d7 mass effects\nAs a practical way of proceeding, which should catch the main effects, we propose\nto correct also earlier analyses [4] with the last factor.\nWe now discuss the manner in which mass effects may be evaluated. As\nthe correction turns out to be small (although not negligible), a perturbative\nmethod is appropriate. In the following, we use effective field theory techniques\nto perform the calculation. As real and virtual photons have already been taken\ninto account, we need a framework that accounts for mass effects only. An obvious\ncandidate is the chiral lagrangian itself, in the absence of real photons. This can\nbe achieved by modifying the lagrangian L2 : one adapts the quark mass matrix,\nM \u2192 diag(mu , md , ms ), and adds mass breaking terms of electromagnetic origin\n[20],\ne\n(15)\nL2 \u2192 L2 + ChQUQU \u2020 i ,\nQ = diag(2, \u22121, \u22121) ,\n3\nwhere C is a low\u2013energy constant that breaks the isospin symmetry of the meson\nmasses, such that M\u03c0 6= M\u03c00 , MK 6= MK 0 . The symbol e stands for the electric\ncharge. At order p4 , there will be additional terms, classified in Refs. [20, 21].\nThe effect of the replacement (15) is twofold: first, because the pion masses split,\nthe loop contributions generated by the diagrams displayed in Fig. 1b),c) have a\ndifferent threshold. Second, in addition to the graphs displayed in figure 1, there\nis a new contribution shown in figure 2: the kaon interacts with the axial current\nto generate a \u03c0 0 \u03b7 intermediate state. Because mu 6= md , the \u03b7 can transform\nback into a neutral pion, that then re\u2013scatters with the second neutral pion into\na charged pion pair. We perform later in this article a quantitative analysis of\nthese effects.\nIn summary, we propose the following framework to purify published phase\nshifts from mass effects.\ni) We assume that the published phase shifts correspond to the ones obtained\nin a world defined by the lagrangian (15),\nfk+ = e2i\u03c8k fk\u2212 , k = 0, 1 ; s \u2265 4M\u03c02 .\nWe refer in the following to \u03c8k as \"measured phase shifts\".\n7\n\n(16)\n\n\f\u03c00\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n\u03c00\n\n\u03b7\n\nFigure 2: One\u2013loop graph in the Ke4 decay amplitude that emerges due to the\n\u03c0 0 \u03b7 mixing. There is no counterpart of this graph in the scalar form factor.\nii) In order to get into contact with the isospin symmetric phase shifts \u03b4k , we\nnote that\n\u03b4k = \u03c8k \u2212 (\u03c8k \u2212 \u03b4k ) , k = 0, 1 .\n\n(17)\n\nThe differences \u03c8k \u2212 \u03b4k on the right\u2013hand side are small, and can be calculated in the effective field theory framework outlined above. After subtracting these from the measured phase shifts \u03c8k , one gets \u03b4k , which can then be\nconfronted with predictions in the framework of ChPT.\nWhile this procedure does not present a complete and full analysis of radiative\ncorrections in Ke4 decays, it allows one to purify published phase shifts from mass\neffects and thus to hopefully retain the main effects of isospin breaking. [One may\nenvisage a more ambitious procedure [22], by working out the relevant matrix\nelements in the framework of ChPT including photons and leptons [23], and then\nconstructing a new event generator, to be used in a new analysis of Ke4 decays3 .\nEventually, such an analysis might lead to an improved algorithm. However, we\nconsider this to be a long term project.]\nThe framework proposed here allows one to investigate the strictures imposed\non the form factors by unitarity and analyticity, even without relying on any specific details of the lagrangian Eq. (15). We find it instructive to discuss this fact\nin some detail in the following section \u2013 before performing the explicit evaluation\nof isospin breaking effects in Ke4 decays \u2013 because it illustrates that, qualitatively,\nthe effects we are finding at the end in those decays do not rely on a specific lagrangian framework, but are present in any theory that breaks isospin symmetry\nand incorporates unitarity and analyticity. [On the other hand, to work out the\neffects in a quantitative manner, a specific underlying theory is needed.] Readers\nwho are not interested in this general setting may wish to skip the following two\n3\n\nThis would also take care of the Coulomb phase, whose effect is suggested to be substantial\nin Refs. [13, 14, 16]. While the Coulomb phase acts in the same direction as the mass effects\nconsidered here \u2013 it increases the difference \u03c80 \u2212\u03c81 \u2212(\u03b40 \u2212\u03b41 ), see section 7 \u2013 it is not clear which\npart thereof is already included in PHOTOS. We, therefore, prefer to stick to the procedure\nproposed here, because these are corrections that are definitely not included in PHOTOS.\n\n8\n\n\fsections and continue directly with section 6, where we take up the case of Ke4\ndecays again, and where we calculate the corrections \u03c80 \u2212 \u03b40 and \u03c81 \u2212 \u03b41 , and\ninvestigate their effect on the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering lengths.\n\n4\n\nWatson's theorem and all that\n\nHere, we discuss Watson's theorem and its modification in the isospin breaking\ncase by using analyticity and unitarity arguments alone. As already mentioned,\nit is not quite straightforward to work out unitarity and analyticity constraints\non the axial current matrix element Eq. (3) which is relevant here, because this\nmatrix element describes the scattering process K + axial current \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0, which\nhas a rather complicated structure. On the other hand, the physical effects\ngenerated by isospin breaking interactions are also present in simpler matrix\nelements like the (Lorentz) scalar form factor of the pion. We, therefore, illustrate\nthe basic facts in this simpler setting. It will become obvious that the same line\nof reasoning could be carried over in the same general framework to the Ke4 form\nfactors, although with much more labor.\nTo set the framework, we consider matrix elements of a hermitian Lorentz\nscalar current j(x), which is taken to be isoscalar in the absence of isospin breaking interactions. To simplify the analysis further, we consider the case where the\nisospin symmetric theory corresponds to the standard SU(2)R \u00d7SU(2)L \u2192 SU(2)\nscenario of spontaneously broken two-flavour QCD, with pions only. Emission of\nreal photons is excluded, as a result of which all matrix elements are infrared\nfinite.\nAs isospin symmetry is assumed to be broken, it is convenient to use state\nvectors that are labelled by the physical pion states. The two form factors are\nh0|j(0)|\u03c0 +(p1 )\u03c0 \u2212 (p2 ); ini = \u2212Fc (s) ,\nh0|j(0)|\u03c0 0(p1 )\u03c0 0 (p2 ); ini = F0 (s) ,\n\ns = (p1 + p2 )2 .\n\n(18)\n\nIn the isospin symmetry limit, one has Fc = F0 in the Condon-Shortley phase\nconvention used here. These form factors are boundary values of functions Fk (z)\nwhich are assumed to be i) holomorphic in CR (4M\u03c020 ), and ii) real on the real\naxis for s < 4M\u03c020 . For further specifications of Fk needed to arrive at the results\ndescribed below, see Appendix B.\nWe also need the elastic \u03c0\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering matrix elements and consider the\nfollowing three channels in \u03c0 a \u03c0 b \u2192 \u03c0 c \u03c0 d : (ab; cd) = (00; 00), (+\u2212; 00), (+\u2212; +\u2212).\nWe denote the scattering matrix elements by Ti (s, t), where i = 0, x, c are the\nchannel labels in the above order, and s, t stand for the Mandelstam variables.\nThe partial-wave expansion reads\n#\n\"\n\u221e\nX\nPl (cos \u03b8)hli (s) ,\n(19)\nTi (s, t) = 32\u03c0 hi (s) +\nl=1\n\n9\n\n\fHere, \u03b8 stands for the scattering angle, and hi (s) denote the pertinent S-waves,\nwhich are needed in the following. They are boundary values of functions hi (z)\nwhich are assumed to be i) holomorphic in CLR (4M\u03c020 ), and ii) real on the real\naxis for 0 < s < 4M\u03c020 . For further specifications of hk needed to arrive at the\nresults described below, see Appendix B.\nThe unitarity conditions for the form factors and for the partial waves read\non the upper rim of the cut\nIm F (s) = T (s)\u03c1(s)F \u2217(s) ,\nIm T (s) = T (s)\u03c1(s)T \u2217(s) ;\n\n4M\u03c020 \u2264 s \u2264 16M\u03c020 .\n\nWe have used the matrix notation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\nhc \u2212hx\nFc\n,\n,\nT =\nF =\n\u2212hx\nh0\nF0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c3(s) \u03b8(s \u2212 4M\u03c02 )\n0\n,\n\u03c1(s) =\n0\n\u03c30 (s) \u03b8(s \u2212 4M\u03c020 )\n\n(20)\n\n(21)\n\ntogether with\n\u03c3(s) =\n\nr\n\n4M\u03c02\n1\u2212\ns\n\n,\n\n\u03c30 (s) =\n\nr\n\n1\u2212\n\n4M\u03c020\n.\ns\n\n(22)\n\nThe quantity \u03c3(z) is holomorphic in CLR (4M\u03c02 ). On the upper rim of the right\u2013\nhand cut we take \u03c3(z) to be positive and real, and the analytic continuation\nthereof elsewhere in the complex z-plane. Analogous statements hold for \u03c30 (z).\n\n4.1\n\nIsospin symmetry limit\n\nIn the isospin symmetry limit, one has\n(hc , hx , h0 ) =\n\n1\n(t2 + 2t0 , 2t2 \u2212 2t0 , 4t2 + 2t0 ) .\n6\n\n(23)\n\nThe quantity tI denotes the partial wave amplitude with angular momentum zero\nand isospin I.

(20) decouple,\nImFc = t0 \u03c3Fc\u2217 ,\nIm tI = \u03c3|tI |2 , I = 0, 2 .\n\n(24)\n\nWe analyse in Appendix B the singularity structure of the partial waves and of\nthe form factor which follow from these relations [24]. The result is as follows:\n\n10\n\n\fi) The form factor develops a square root singularity at the threshold z = 4M\u03c02 ,\nFc (z) = A(z) + i\u03c3B(z) ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere A, B are meromorphic in CLR (16M\u03c02 ), and real on the real axis in the\ninterval 0 < s < 16M\u03c02 .\nii) Define the phase\n\u03b8(z) = arctan\n\n\u03c3(z)B(z)\n.\nA(z)\n\n(26)\n\nIn the elastic interval, \u03b8 coincides with the phase shift \u03b40 of the partial\nwave t0 \u2013 this is Watson's theorem. The above definition of \u03b8 holds also\nfor complex values of z. As a result, \u03b8 is holomorphic in the shaded region\nshown in Fig. 3, cut along the positive real axis for s > 4M\u03c02 . [Although \u03b8(z)\nis complex in general, we keep calling this quantity phase for simplicity.]\niii) In analogy to Eq.

To render the discussion simple, we assume that these terms are\nreasonably small, such that the isospin symmetric values of the form factors and\nof the scattering matrix are only slightly modified. This can always be arranged\nby adjusting the relevant parameters in the lagrangian, and allows us to discuss\nthe changes induced in a simpler manner. We analyse the singularity structure\nof the form factors Fc,0 in Eq. (18) in the general case in Appendix B as well,\nand we find that the four statements i) to iv) made above are modified in the\nfollowing manner:\ni') The form factors have the threshold behaviour\nFk = Ak + i\u03c3Bk + i\u03c30 Ck + \u03c3\u03c30 Dk ; k = c, 0 ,\n\n(29)\n\nwith coefficients Ak , . . . , Dk that are meromorphic in CLR (16M\u03c020 ), and real\non the real axis in the interval 0 < s < 16M\u03c020 .\nii') Let\n\u03b8k (z) = arctan\n\n\u03c3(z)Bk (z) + \u03c30 (z)Ck (z)\n,\nAk (z) + \u03c3(z)\u03c30 (z)Dk (z)\n\n(30)\n\nand introduce the phase\u2013removed form factors F\u0302k ,\nF\u0302k (z) = e\u2212i\u03b8k (z) Fk (z) .\n\n(31)\n\nThe quantities F\u0302k are holomorphic in the (cut) shaded region shown in Fig.\n4, and real on the real axis in the intervals 0 < s < 4M\u03c020 and 4M\u03c02 < s <\n16M\u03c020 .\niii') In contrast to the isospin symmetric case one finds that\na) the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering amplitude does not fully determine the phases \u03b8k\nbelow the inelastic region,\nb) \u03b8c does not vanish at the threshold s = 4M\u03c02 ,\n\u03b8c 6\u2192 0 , s \u2192 4M\u03c02 .\n12\n\n(32)\n\n\fF0 =\n\nf0\n\n+\n\nf0\n\n+\nC00\n\nfc\n\n+ ...\nCx\n\nFigure 5: Bubble diagrams, contributing to the neutral scalar form factor in the\nnon-relativistic effective theory.

[One may be tempted to get rid\nof the problem by defining a form factor where the pertinent Omn\u00e8s factor is\nremoved. In the present case, this is not what one wants to do, because the aim\nis to measure the phase shift, which is needed to evaluate the Omn\u00e8s factor.]\n\n5\n\nExplicit examples\n\nWe find it useful to provide in this section examples of form factors that illustrate\nthe analytic properties worked out above.\n\n5.1\n\nScalar form factor in a non-relativistic effective theory\n\nIn order to describe the behaviour of the scalar form factor in the low\u2013energy\nregion q 2 = s/(4M\u03c02 ) \u2212 1 \u226a 1, \u2206\u03c0 = M\u03c02 \u2212 M\u03c020 \u226a M\u03c02 , we use the framework\nof non-relativistic effective field theory (NREFT) as developed in Refs. [25\u201328].\nThis formulation is especially convenient to study the singularity structure near\nthreshold, because the locations of the low\u2013energy singularities coincide with\nthat in the relativistic QFT to all orders in the low\u2013energy expansion. A similar\nnon-relativistic framework has recently been used to study K \u2192 3\u03c0 decays in\nthe vicinity of cusps [25\u201327]. The effects that we are addressing in this section\nhave the same physical origin as the cusps in K \u2192 3\u03c0 decays. They emerge,\nbecause the final state interactions involve both, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 pairs, with\ndifferent masses M\u03c0 6= M\u03c00 . We display the pertinent non-relativistic lagrangian\nin Appendix C.\nThe scalar form factors Fc (s) and F0 (s), defined in Eq. (C.16), are given\nby a sum of bubble diagrams, see Fig. 5. The infinite series of these bubble\n13\n\n\fdiagrams can be explicitly re-summed. The resulting expressions for Fc (s), F0 (s)\nare boundary values of meromorphic functions Fc (z), F0 (z) at z \u2192 s + i0, with\nFc (z) =\n\nfc (1 \u2212 2i\u03c30 d0 ) \u2212 2i\u03c30 f0 dx\n,\n1 \u2212 2i\u03c30 d0 \u2212 4i\u03c3dc \u2212 2\u03c3\u03c30 \u03c7\n\nF0 (z) =\n\n\u22124i\u03c3fc dx + f0 (1 \u2212 4i\u03c3dc )\n,\n1 \u2212 2i\u03c30 d0 \u2212 4i\u03c3dc \u2212 2\u03c3\u03c30 \u03c7\n\n(34)\n\nwhere di , i = c, x, 0 and fk , k = c, 0 denote polynomials of first order in z, and\n\u03c7 = 4(dc d0 \u2212 d2x ). The coefficients of these polynomials are expressed through\nvarious non-relativistic couplings which, in turn, are determined by performing\nthe matching to the underlying relativistic theory (see, e.g. [25\u201328]). In particular,\nthe polynomials di contain 4-pion non-relativistic couplings and are expressed in\nterms of the effective-range expansion parameters for the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering through\nthe matching of the \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes at threshold. Similarly, the polynomials fk\nare determined from the matching to the relativistic form factors, expanded at\nthreshold.\nFurther, the quantities di , fk contain isospin-breaking corrections. We write\ndi = d \u0304i + d\u2032i (and similarly for fk ), where d \u0304i stands for di calculated in the isospin\nlimit. In analogy with Eq. (23), d \u0304i can be expressed through two first-order\npolynomials v0 , v2 , corresponding to total isospin I = 0, 2 ,\n1\n(d \u0304c , d \u0304x , d \u03040 ) =\n(v2 + 2v0 , 2v2 \u2212 2v0 , 4v2 + 2v0 ) .\n12\n\n(35)\n\nz \u2212 4M\u03c02\naI rI ,\n4M\u03c02\n\n(36)\n\nHere,\nvI (z) = aI +\n\nI = 0, 2 ,\n\nand aI /aI rI stand for the scattering length/effective range parameter in the\nisospin limit, see Ref. [25].\nProviding similar explicit expressions for the isospin-breaking corrections in di\nand fk is not possible in general. The form of these corrections is not universal and\nthe calculations should be performed within a particular underlying relativistic\ntheory. An example of calculations in ChPT at one loop is considered in the\nfollowing subsection.\nWe add several comments concerning the structure of the two form factors.\ni) As already mentioned, the form factors Fc (z), F0 (z) are meromorphic functions in the cut plane displayed in Fig. 6a. The non-relativistic domain in\nthe complex plane is defined as a strip surrounding the physical cut \u2013 it is\nindicated with the shaded region in the figure. It extends slightly below and\nabove of the physical branch point, well below the first inelastic threshold.\nThe maximal distance to the branch point in the non-relativistic region is\n14\n\n\fFigure 6: The analyticity domain of the form factor Fc (z) (left panel) and the\nphase\u2013removed form factor F\u0302c (z) (right panel). The shaded area denotes the\nnon-relativistic region and the filled circles indicate the positions of the poles on\nthe first Riemann sheet. Both the left-hand cut and the poles lie outside the\nnon-relativistic domain.\nset by the mass scale M\u03c0 . NREFT makes sense only in the non-relativistic\nregion \u2013 the cut along the negative z-axis, as well as the distant poles on the\nfirst sheet should be regarded as artefacts of the non-relativistic treatment.\nii) The form factors have the representation (29). Constructing the \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes in the same manner as the form factors, one finds that the unitarity\nrelation given in Eq. (20) indeed is satisfied.\niii) In order to obtain the phase\u2013removed form factor, we define the phase as in\nEq.

Numerically, the effect is tiny.\niv) Expanding the phase in powers of \u03c3, \u03c30 gives\n\u03b8c (z) = 4\u03c3dc \u2212 2\u03c30 dx\n\nf0\n+ O({\u03c3, \u03c30 }3 ) .\nfc\n\n(41)\n\nThis expansion is very useful in the context of ChPT, since the generic\nexpansion parameter here is {\u03c3, \u03c30 } \u00d7 dc,x,0, with dc,x,0 = O(p2 ). Thus, the\nneglected terms in Eq. (41) are of order p6 and higher. Furthermore, in\norder to calculate the phase at O(p4 ) (two loops), the ratio f0 /fc should be\nevaluated at O(p2 ) and the matching of the polynomials dc , dx should be\nperformed at O(p4 ) (at this order, di (z) are polynomials of second order in\nz). To this end, it suffices to use the one\u2013loop result both for the form factor\nand for the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering amplitudes.\nv) As mentioned earlier, the phase \u03b8c is not determined by the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering\namplitude alone. Indeed, \u03b8c depends on the ratio f0 /fc , which can take\nany value in the absence of isospin symmetry. In addition, this ratio contains low\u2013energy constants (LECs) which do not occur in the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering\namplitude, as will be illustrated in subsection 5.2.\nvi) The standard way to define the phase of the form factor on the real axis in\nthe interval s \u2265 4M\u03c020 is\n\u03c6c = arctan\n\nIm Fc (s + i0)\n.\nRe Fc (s + i0)\n\n16\n\n(42)\n\n\f15\n\n\u03c6c\n\nphases (degrees)\n\n10 \u00d7 (\u03c6c-\u03b40)\n\n\u03b40\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.275\n\n0.325\n\n0.35\n\n\u221as (GeV)\n\nFigure 8: The phases \u03c6c and \u03b40 , as well as their difference. The cusp in the phase\n\u03c6c at the charged threshold s = 4M\u03c02 is clearly visible. The isospin-symmetric\nparts d \u0304i have been determined from the matching condition, Eqs. (35) and (36),\nwith the scattering lengths and effective radii taken from Ref. [2]. The isospin\nbreaking corrections d\u2032i were evaluated in ChPT at O(p2 ), see Eq. (50). The ratio\nf0 /fc was set to one.\nThe quantity \u03c6c does not vanish at the charged threshold s = 4M\u03c02 and has\na cusp there. This is illustrated in Fig. 8, where the phase \u03c6c is plotted. For\ncomparison, the isospin-symmetric phase \u03b40 and the difference \u03c6c \u2212 \u03b40 are\ndisplayed as well.

In particular, F denotes the\npion decay constant in the chiral limit, U is the pion field matrix, the quantity\nB is related to the quark condensate, s = M + s\u2032 is the scalar source, M and\nQ stand for the quark mass and charge matrices in the SU(2) case, respectively,\nand the coupling C is proportional to \u2206\u03c0 at lowest order in the chiral expansion.\nIn accordance to the discussion in section 3, we do not include virtual photons.\nWe do not display the order p4 Lagrangian L4 explicitly. It is given, e.g.,\nin Refs. [20]. Note that, since we do not include virtual photons, the ultraviolet\ndivergences of the \"electromagnetic\" LECs ki from Refs.

The quantity \u03bc is\nthe scale of dimensional regularization in ChPT.\nKcr = \u2212\n\n18\n\n\fThe scalar form factor of the pion in the presence of isospin breaking have\nbeen evaluated in Ref. [29]. Our expressions agree with those of Ref. [29] up to\ncontributions of virtual photons and terms of order e4 , e2 (md \u2212 mu ) and (md \u2212\nmu )2 .\nThe phase of the charged form factor at one loop, extracted from Eq. (46), is\ngiven by\n\u03b8c (s) =\n\n1 \b\n(4\u2206\u03c0 + s)\u03c3 + (s \u2212 M\u03c020 )\u03c30 .\n32\u03c0F 2\n\n(49)\n\nIt is seen that \u03b8c indeed does not vanish at the threshold s = 4M\u03c02 .\nNext we determine the non-relativistic couplings di , fk , performing the matching to ChPT at O(p2 ). We start from di , which can be directly read off from the\ntree\u2013level S-wave \u03c0\u03c0 scattering amplitudes:\ns + 4\u2206\u03c0\n+ O(p4) ,\n128\u03c0F 2\ns \u2212 M\u03c020\ndx (s) = \u2212\n+ O(p4) ,\n64\u03c0F 2\nM\u03c020\nd0 (s) =\n+ O(p4 ) .\n64\u03c0F 2\ndc (s) =\n\n(50)\n\nThe quantities fk at O(p2 ) can be determined by performing the matching to the\none\u2013loop expressions for the form factors, given in Eq. (46). For the ratio f0 /fc\none gets\nf0\n= H0 + H1 (s \u2212 4M\u03c02 ) + O((s \u2212 4M\u03c02 )2 ) ,\nfc\n3\u2206\u03c0 L\n+ e2 (K0r \u2212 Kcr ) + O(\u22062\u03c0 , p4 ) ,\n2\n2\n16\u03c0 F\n\u2206\u03c0\n=\n+ O(\u22062\u03c0 , p2 ) .\n2\n12\u03c0 F 2 M\u03c02\n\nH0 = 1 +\nH1\n\n(51)\n\nWe note that in the case of isospin violation the ratio f0 /fc is not determined\nonly by the LECs that enter the \u03c0\u03c0 amplitude. For example, even in the chiral\nlimit the ratio f0 /fc contains the LEC k8 , which is absent from the \u03c0\u03c0 amplitudes\nin this limit. Consequently, in the case of broken isospin, the phase of the form\nfactors is not determined by the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering amplitudes alone.\nIt is easy to check that the expression for the phase Eq. (49) can be directly\nobtained from Eq. (41) by using the result of the tree\u2013level matching, given in\nEq. (50). At this order, one may take f0 /fc = 1 + O(p2 ).\nIn order to check the convergence of the chiral expansion, we have evaluated\nthe phase of the charged form factor at two loops. We do not display the final\nresult here. As expected, the next-to-leading correction lies within approximately\n30% of the leading-order result, see section 7 for a more quantitative result.\n19\n\n\f6\n\nKe4 decays: isospin breaking\n\nWe now come back to the analysis of Ke4 decays. We simply need to repeat the\nabove analysis, this time for the matrix element Eq. (3) of the axial current.\nWorking out the contributions from diagrams Figs. 1 and 2, one finds that\nthe phase \u03c80 of the form factor f0 [see Eq. (16)] becomes in the elastic region\n4M\u03c02 < s < 16M\u03c020\n\u0013 \u001b\n\u0012\n\u001a\n3\n1\n2\n\u03c30 + O(p4) ,\n(52)\n(4\u2206\u03c0 + s)\u03c3 + (s \u2212 M\u03c00 ) 1 +\n\u03c80 =\n32\u03c0F 2\n2R\nwith\nR=\n\nms \u2212 m\u0302\n,\nmd \u2212 mu\n\n(53)\n\nand F the pion decay constant in the SU(2) chiral limit. The phase of the form\nfactor f1 does not contain at this order any isospin breaking effects [these are\ngenerated by \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 intermediate states, which cannot couple to P-waves], as a\nresult of which one has\n\u03c81 = \u03b41\n\n(54)\n\nat this order in the low\u2013energy expansion. The one\u2013loop expressions for the form\nfactors F, G given in Refs. [16] contain the effects considered here, up to terms of\norder e2 (md \u2212 mu ).\nWe comment on this result. First, in comparison to the pion form factor\ndiscussed above, there is an additional term present, proportional to md \u2212 mu .\nThis is in agreement with the statement made before: the phase is not fixed by\nthe \u03c0\u03c0 amplitude alone, which does not contain any md \u2212 mu terms at one\u2013loop\norder. Second, the difference to the isospin symmetric phase now grows with s\neven at one\u2013loop order,\n\u03c80 \u2212 \u03b40 =\n\n3s 1\n+ O(1) ,\n64\u03c0F 2 R\n\ns/M\u03c02 \u226b 1 .\n\n(55)\n\nAccording to the discussion in section 3, one has to subtract the difference \u03c80 \u2212\u03b40\nfrom the measured phase shift before a comparison with the chiral prediction can\nbe performed. In figure 9 we display this difference in the relevant decay region,\nfor R = 37 \u00b1 5. The width of the band reflects the uncertainty in R. It is seen\nthat the isospin correction is quite substantial \u2013 well above the systematic and\nstatistical uncertainties quoted for the measured phase shift [7].\nIn addition, similarly to the case of the scalar form factor, the phase\u2013removed\nform factor for the Ke4 decays is not holomorphic at the charged threshold and,\nconsequently, in the expansion of this form factor even and odd powers of the\nvariable q are present, in contrast to the isospin symmetric case, see Eq. (10).

The width of the band reflects the uncertainty\nin the ratio R = 37 \u00b1 5.\nthe value of the form factor at q = 0 is factored out, the coefficient of the term\nlinear in q is the same as in the case of the scalar form factor at leading order in\nChPT. On the other hand, this is a two\u2013loop effect and therefore suppressed in\nmagnitude. To obtain a reliable estimate of its size is beyond the scope of this\nwork.\n\n7\n\n\u03c0\u03c0 scattering lengths from Ke4 decays\n\nThe first large-statistics experiment to measure the phase \u03c80 \u2212 \u03c81 in Ke4 decays\nhas been performed by the Geneva-Saclay collaboration about thirty years ago.\nIn this experiment about 30'000 Ke4 decays have been collected and analysed [4].\nMore recently the E865 experiment at Brookhaven [4] and the NA48/2 experiment\nat CERN [5] have each collected more than ten times the statistics and have made\npossible a precise extraction of the scattering length a00 . So precise in fact, that\na proper treatment of the isospin breaking corrections as discussed in this paper\nbecomes essential.\nIn this section we discuss how the isospin breaking corrections influence the\nextraction of the scattering length, and will do this for all three data sets.

Contours shown correspond to one\nsigma. The ellipses do not take into account any theoretical uncertainty.\n\nperform two kinds of analyses: we will either leave both S-wave scattering lengths\nfree and fit them to the data, or use a low\u2013energy theorem which relates both of\nthem to the scalar radius of the pion and end up with a one\u2013parameter fit [30].\nFor the two\u2013parameter fits we have used the parametrization of the \u03c0\u03c0 phase\nshifts corresponding to solutions of the Roy equations as functions of the two\nS-wave scattering lengths which was provided in [31]. To evaluate numerically\nthe isospin breaking correction (52) we have used R = 37 \u00b1 5 and F = 86.2 \u00b1 0.5\nMeV [32] \u2013 moreover we use the fact that \u03c81 = \u03b41 at one\u2013loop order. The results\nof these fits are shown in Fig. 10 as one\u2013sigma contours (68% probability, i.e.\n\u03c72 = \u03c72min + 2.31) for the two most recent data sets, with and without taking into\naccount isospin-breaking corrections. The ellipses corresponding to the GenevaSaclay data are too large in comparison and for this reason we have not shown\nthem in the same figure. The figure shows that while the ellipse corresponding\nto the uncorrected NA48 data does not overlap with the theoretical prediction,\nafter applying the isospin breaking correction, the two overlap completely. For the\nellipses corresponding to the E865 data the situation is reversed: before applying\nisospin breaking corrections there is a perfect overlap, whereas after applying\nthem the experimental one\u2013sigma contour and the theory prediction barely touch.\nThe figure also clearly shows that the two sets of very high statistics data are\nnot in very good mutual agreement: the two one\u2013sigma ellipses (with or without\nisospin breaking corrections) do not have any significant overlap. It has been\n22\n\n\frecently pointed out by Brigitte Bloch-Devaux that the origin of this tension lies\nin the data point in the last bin of the E865 data set [7], for which the evaluation\nof the barycenter may need to be revised [33]: we have verified that indeed it\nis enough to remove this point from the fit to obtain an almost perfect overlap\nbetween the two ellipses.\nWe take into account the constraint of the pion scalar radius as follows: we\nuse the numerical estimate hr 2 is = 0.61 \u00b1 0.04 fm2 [2], which implies the relation\na20 = f (\u2206a00 ) \u00b1 0.0008 ,\n\u2206a00 \u2261 a00 \u2212 0.22 ,\nf (x) = \u22120.0444 + 0.236 x \u2212 0.61 x2 \u2212 9.9 x3 ,\n\n(56)\n\nwhere the error accounts for the various sources of uncertainty in the input used\nin the Roy equation solutions. In our fits we minimize the following \u03c72 :\n\u00132\n\u0012 2\na0 \u2212 f (\u2206a00 )\n2\n\u03c7tot =\n+ \u03c72Ke4 .\n(57)\n0.0008\nSince the Ke4 data are very little sensitive to a20 , the minimum of the \u03c72 lies\nthen always on the f (\u2206a00 ) line, but in this way we also take into account the\nuncertainty in the scalar radius relation. The results of the fits are:\nwithout applying isospin breaking corrections\n\uf8f1\n\u03c72 = 2.2 Geneva-Saclay [ 5 data pts.]\n\uf8f2 0.243 \u00b1 0.037\n0.218 \u00b1 0.013\n\u03c72 = 5.8 E865\n[ 6 data pts.]\na00 =\n\uf8f3\n2\n0.245 \u00b1 0.007\n\u03c7 = 9.6 NA48\n[10 data pts.] ,\nand after applying isospin breaking corrections\n\uf8f1\n\u03c72 = 2.1 Geneva-Saclay\n\uf8f2 0.222 \u00b1 0.040\n0.195 \u00b1 0.013\n\u03c72 = 6.6 E865\na00 =\n\uf8f3\n0.223 \u00b1 0.007\n\u03c72 = 11.5 NA48 .\n\n(58)\n\n(59)\n\nAveraging the latter three independent determinations yields a00 = 0.217 \u00b1 0.008\nwhere the error has been inflated by an S = 1.3 factor according to the PDG\nprescription (the \u03c72 of the average of the three fits is equal to 6.3). Repeating\nthe same procedure after having removed the last data point in the E865 set\nyields a00 = 0.221 \u00b1 0.007 with \u03c72 \u2243 0.7, so confirming the observation of Brigitte\nBloch-Devaux [7]. We also briefly comment on the vertex corrections at order\n\u03b1QED mentioned in section 3. They lower the value of a00 by \u2243 0.013. For reasons\nalready mentioned, we do not take these corrections into account in the present\nwork.\nThe extraction of the scattering length a00 from the phase shift \u03c80 \u2212 \u03c81 measured in Ke4 data requires theory input in two steps: the first is the subject of\n23\n\n\fthis article, the evaluation of the isospin breaking corrections which lead from\n\u03c80 \u2212 \u03c81 to \u03b40 \u2212 \u03b41 , and the second is the step from the phase \u03b40 \u2212 \u03b41 to the\nscattering length. Both steps can be made quite accurately, but both are subject\nto a theory uncertainty which, though small, has to be properly accounted for\nat the level of precision currently reached by experiments. As far as step one\nis concerned, the evaluation of the isospin breaking correction given in Eq. (52)\nrelies on an estimate of F and R as discussed above. A one\u2013sigma change in F\nhas no visible effect in the fitted value of a00 , whereas a change of R by five units\nshifts a00 by 0.001. Our one\u2013loop estimate of these effects is subject to higher\u2013\norder corrections. We have evaluated these in the case of the scalar form factor\nof the pion discussed in previous sections. If we use the latter as our estimate\nof higher\u2013order isospin breaking effects and repeat the fits, we get a value of a00\nshifted by 0.004. An alternative quick way to estimate two\u2013loop effects is to\nsubstitute F with the physical F\u03c0 \u2013 doing this the fitted value of the scattering\nlength changes by 0.003. We conclude that 0.004 is a reasonable estimate of the\nuncertainty due to higher\u2013order isospin breaking corrections. As for step two, the\nmain source of uncertainty in the calculation of how the Roy equation solution\ndepend on a00 is represented by the value of the \u03b40 phase at 0.8 GeV [31], which\nhad been estimated to be (82.3 \u00b1 3.4)\u25e6 . Changing the latter by one sigma and\nrepeating the fits leads to a shift of a00 by 0.004. If we sum in squares these four\ndifferent sources of uncertainty (namely: value of F , value of R, higher\u2013order\nisospin breaking corrections and value of \u03b40 (0.8GeV) we end up with\na00 = 0.217 \u00b1 0.008exp \u00b1 0.006th ,\n\n(60)\n\nwhich represents the current best experimental determination of the isospin zero\nS-wave scattering length coming from Ke4 decays. NA48 is currently analysing\nmore statistics [7], and we expect that when the updated analysis will become\navailable, the experimental error will reach or even become smaller than the\ntheoretical one. Other competitive determinations coming from the cusp in K \u2192\n3\u03c0 decays [10] and from pionium lifetime [9] are also expected to be improved in\nthe near future.\n\n8\n\nComparison with other work\n\nThe isospin-breaking corrections to the Ke4 decays have been evaluated in the\npast by using various theoretical settings. We briefly review some recent articles\nwhere the problem has been addressed.\nIn Ref. [16], a full set of isospin-breaking corrections to the Ke4 decays of\ncharged kaons has been calculated at one loop in ChPT. Our result for the elastic phase shift given in Eq. (52) agrees with the result of Refs. [16] in the absence\nof virtual photon contributions. As already mentioned in section 3, these cal24\n\n\fculations might provide a basis for an algorithm which removes isospin-breaking\ncorrections from the raw experimental data.\nIn Refs. [13, 14], isospin-breaking corrections to Ke4 decays have been treated\nin an approach which may be considered a merger between K-matrix theory and\na conventional quantum-mechanical framework used to study Coulomb interactions in the final state. Although some of the expressions in Refs. [13, 14] closely\nresemble the pertinent formulae of the present work, the framework used is incomplete and, as far as we can see, incorrect. To mention two examples, we note\nthat a relation between the amplitude considered there and the Ke4 decay matrix element is not provided, and the effect caused by the quark mass difference\nmd \u2212 mu is not discussed at all. Moreover, according to the explicit formulae\ngiven in Refs. [14], the effect of isospin breaking \u2013 in the absence of Coulomb\ninteractions \u2013 can be expressed through the S-wave \u03c0\u03c0 scattering phases (in the\nisospin limit) and the pion mass difference. As we show in the present article, this\nis not correct. The authors of Refs. [13, 14] also provide a set of electromagnetic\ncorrections which include both, vertex corrections and rescattering of the virtual\npions through the exchange of Coulomb photons (the latter is a two\u2013loop effect\nin our terminology). As already mentioned, it is not clear which part of these\ncorrections was already taken into account in present analyses. We conclude that\none should not use the results of Refs. [13, 14] in data analyses of Ke4 decays.\n\n9\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nData on Ke4 decays allow one to measure the difference of the S- and P-wave\nphases \u03c80 \u2212\u03c81 of a particular form factor in the matrix element of the strangenesschanging axial current. If isospin symmetry were exact, \u03c80 \u2212 \u03c81 would coincide\nwith the difference of the S- and P-wave \u03c0\u03c0 scattering phase shifts \u03b40 \u2212 \u03b41 (Watson's theorem). We have shown that the situation changes if isospin symmetry\nis broken. In particular,\ni) The phases \u03c80 and \u03b40 are not equal. Moreover, \u03c80 is not determined by the\n\u03c0\u03c0 scattering amplitudes alone (e.g., the former contains the LECs which\nare absent in the latter).\nii) The phase \u03c80 does not vanish at the threshold s = 4M\u03c02 .\niii) At threshold, the expansion in Eq. (10), which is valid in the isospin symmetry limit, becomes e\u2212i\u03c80 f0 (s, sl ) = c\u03040 + c\u03041 q + c\u03042 q 2 + O(q 3) , where the\ncoefficients c\u0304i depend on the variable sl , and similarly for the P-wave form\nfactor f1 (although at higher order in the chiral expansion).\nFinally, in order to determine the isospin symmetric phases from data, one\nuses Eq. (17) and calculates the difference \u03c8k \u2212\u03b4k , which must then be subtracted\nfrom the measured phases \u03c8k . We have performed this calculation at one loop\nin ChPT for Ke4 decays and have shown that the correction is substantial, well\n25\n\n\fabove the statistical and systematic errors in present NA48/2 data. Once this is\ntaken into account, the determination of the isospin zero S-wave scattering length\nfrom Ke4 data yields\na00 = 0.217 \u00b1 0.008exp \u00b1 0.006th ,\nin excellent agreement with the chiral prediction.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to the late F.J.

The issue was discussed in the\nliterature long ago [24] \u2013 we keep the presentation therefore short.\n\nB.1\n\nIsospin symmetric case\n\nThe partial waves are denoted by tk . We assume that these i) are holomorphic\nin the cut plane CI shown in Fig. B.1, ii) are real on the real axis 0 < s < 4M\u03c02 ,\nand iii) converge to continuous boundary values tk (s) as z \u2192 s. The form factors\nare boundary values of functions Fk (z) which are assumed to be i) holomorphic\nin the complex z-plane, cut at z = s for s \u2265 4M\u03c02 , ii) real on the real axis for\ns < 4M\u03c02 , iii) nonzero for finite |z|. Furthermore, we assume that Fk (z) converge\nto continuous boundary values Fk (s) as z \u2192 s.\nWe introduce the two\u2013particle irreducible amplitude\nt(z) =\n\nt0 (z)\n.\n1 + i\u03c3(z)t0 (z)\n\n(B.2)\n\nIt is meromorphic in CI . The poles are due to possible zeros in the denominator.\nIn the elastic region, the discontinuity of t vanishes. \u00bfFrom the Edge-of-theWedge theorem (EWT) it then follows that t is meromorphic in the cut plane\nCII displayed in Fig. B.1. Solving for t0 gives\nt0 (z) = F (z) + i\u03c3G(z)\nt\n, G = tF .\nF =\n1 + \u03c3 2 t2\n27\n\n(B.3)\n\n\f0\n\n2\n\n4M \u03c0\n\n0\n\nz inel.\n\nz inel.\n\ncut plane CII\n\ncut plane CI\n\n2\n\n4M \u03c0\n\nz inel.\n\n0\n\nregion CIII\nFigure B.1: Regions of analyticity in the complex z\u2013plane, isospin symmetric\ncase. We assume that tk are holomorphic in the cut plane CI . The two-particle\nirreducible amplitude t is then meromorphic in the cut plane CII , and the phase\u2013\nremoved form factor F\u0302c is holomorphic in the shaded region CIII . The symbol\nzinel denotes the inelastic threshold z = 16M\u03c02 .\nThe quantities F, G are meromorphic in CII . From this representation, it follows\nthat the analytic continuation of t0 to the second Riemann sheet is [24]\n(2)\n\nt0 =\n\nt0\n,\n1 + 2i\u03c3t0\n\n(B.4)\n\nwhich shows that the zeros of the S-matrix on the first Riemann sheet correspond\nto poles of the partial waves on the second Riemann sheet, at the same value of\nz.\nNow consider the form factor Fc , and define the ratio\nR(z) =\n\nFc (z)\n,\nt0 (z)\n\n(B.5)\n\nwhich is meromorphic in CI . Unitarity and EWT show that the elastic cut is\nabsent. Therefore, one has the decomposition\nFc (z) = A(z) + i\u03c3B(z) ,\n\n(B.6)\n\nwith A, B meromorphic in CII . Furthermore, the form factor generates a pole on\nthe second Riemann sheet as well, at the same place where t0 does. Finally, the\nphase defined in Eq. (26) coincides with the isospin zero S\u2013wave \u03c0\u03c0 phase shift\nin the elastic interval, because R is real there. The phase\u2013removed form factor\nin Eq. (27) is holomorphic in the shaded region CIII displayed in Fig. (B.1).\n28\n\n\fB.2\n\nIsospin broken case\n\nThe threshold structure of the form factor displayed in Eq. (29) can be obtained\nin a manner quite analogously to the previous subsection. One first works out\nthe threshold behaviour of the scattering amplitudes. We assume that the hk i)\nare holomorphic in the region DI displayed in Fig. B.2, ii) are real on the real\naxis in the interval 0 < s < 4M\u03c020 , and ii) converge to continuous boundary values\nhk (s) as z \u2192 s. The form factors Fk are assumed to satisfy the same conditions\nas above, with M\u03c02 \u2192 M\u03c020 .\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\nz inel.\n\n4M \u03c0 0 4M \u03c0\n\nz inel.\n\ncut plane DII\n\ncut plane DI\n2\n\n4M \u03c0 0\n\n2\n\nz inel.\n\n4M \u03c0\n\n0\n\nregion DIII\nFigure B.2: Regions of analyticity in the complex z-plane, isopin broken case. We\nassume that tk are holomorphic in the cut plane DI . The two-particle irreducible\namplitude T\u0302 is meromorphic in the cut plane DII , and the phase\u2013removed form\nfactor F\u0302c is holomorphic in the shaded region DIII , with the cut indicated. The\nsymbol zinel denotes the inelastic threshold z = 16M\u03c020 .\nWe introduce the matrix\n\u03c1\u0304(z) =\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c3(z)\n0\n0\n\u03c30 (z)\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(B.7)\n\ncompare the comments after Eq. (22). Consider the two\u2013particle irreducible\namplitudes\nT\u0302 = (1 + iT \u03c1\u0304)\u22121 T ,\n\n(B.8)\n\nwhere the matrix T is defined in Eq. (21). Unitarity and EWT show that the cut\n4M\u03c020 < s < 16M\u03c020 is absent for T\u0302 , from where we conclude that the matrix T\nhas the threshold structure\nT = A\u2032 + i\u03c3B \u2032 + i\u03c30 C \u2032 + \u03c3\u03c30 D \u2032\n29\n\n(B.9)\n\n\fwith matrices A\u2032 , B \u2032 , C \u2032 , D \u2032 whose entries are meromorphic in DII . Next, one\nforms\n\u0012 \u0013\nRc\n= T \u22121 F ,\n(B.10)\nR0\nwhere F is the matrix in Eq. (21), and uses again unitarity and EWT to show\nthat Rc,0 are meromorphic in DII . Solving for F gives\nFk = Ak + i\u03c3Bk + i\u03c30 Ck + \u03c3\u03c30 Dk ; k = c, 0 ,\n\n(B.11)\n\nwith Ak , * * * , Dk meromorphic in DII . Evaluating the phases \u03b8k according to\nEq. (30) shows that these depend on the ratio R0 /Rc . On the other hand, this\nratio depends on Fc /F0 , which is unity in the isospin limit, and different otherwise.\nIn subsection 5.2 we show that, in case of ChPT, Fc /F0 contains LECs that do\nnot occur in the \u03c0\u03c0 scattering amplitude. Hence the phases \u03b8k are not determined\nby the \u03c0\u03c0 amplitude alone in the case of broken isospin. From (30), it is seen that\nthe phase \u03b8c does not vanish at the threshold s = 4M\u03c02 , because \u03c30 (4M\u03c02 ) 6= 0.\nFinally, from Eq. (B.11), one finds for the phase\u2013removed form factor the result\n\"\n\u00132 # 21\n\u0012\n\u03c3Bc + \u03c30 Cc\n.\n(B.12)\nF\u0302c = (Ac + \u03c3\u03c30 Dc ) 1 +\nAc + \u03c3\u03c30 Dc\nIt is holomorphic in the cut region DIII displayed in Fig. B.2. The cut is due to\nthe factor \u03c3\u03c30 .\n\nC\n\nNon-relativistic effective Lagrangian framework\n\nThe non-relativistic Lagrangian L = L\u03c0\u03c0 + LO , which is used for calculation of\nthe scalar form factor, consists of a part describing quartic pion-pion interactions,\nand a part corresponding to the interaction of the pion pair with the external\ncurrent O(x). The framework is described in detail in our recent works [25\u201327]\nand will not be repeated here. For example, the Lagrangian L\u03c0\u03c0 is given in Eq.\n(4) of Ref. [25]. The polynomials di (z), introduced in section 5.1, are given by\n32\u03c0dc = C+\u2212 + (z \u2212 4M\u03c02 )D+\u2212 ,\n32\u03c0dx = Cx + (z \u2212 4M\u03c02 )Dx ,\n32\u03c0d0 = C00 + (z \u2212 4M\u03c020 )D00 .\n\n(C.13)\n\nHere we use the same notations for the 4-pion couplings C, D as in Refs. [25\u201327].\nThe matching of these couplings to the effective-range expansion parameters in\nthe \u03c0\u03c0 scattering amplitudes is described in these references as well.\n30\n\n\fThe part of the Lagrangian which is responsible for the interaction with the\nexternal source takes the form\n\u0012\nLO = O \u2212f1 \u03a6\u2020+ \u03a6\u2020\u2212 + f2 (W\u00b1 \u03a6\u2020+ W\u00b1 \u03a6\u2020\u2212 + \u2207\u03a6\u2020+ \u2207\u03a6\u2020\u2212 \u2212 M\u03c02 \u03a6\u2020+ \u03a6\u2020\u2212 )\n\u0013\nf3 \u2020 \u2020 f4\n\u2020 \u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n2\n\u03a6 \u03a6 \u2212 (W0 \u03a60 W0 \u03a60 + \u2207\u03a60 \u2207\u03a60 \u2212 M\u03c00 \u03a60 \u03a60 ) + h.c.
