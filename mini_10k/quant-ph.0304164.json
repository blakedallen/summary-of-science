Its protocol was originally proposed by using a two-dimensional\nsystem, qubit, such as the polarization of light [1]. Other\nprotocols were also considered to teleport the quadrature phase components [2, 3] and the multi-dimensional\nstates such as photon number states [1, 3, 4, 5]. Among\nthese media for quantum teleportation, the photon number Fock space may be considered more promising in\nthe view point that it provides higher dimensional states\nsuch as qutrits to carry more quantum information than\nqubits.\nIn order to perform faithfully the number state teleportation in some finite dimensional subspace of Fock space,\nmaximally entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) resource is required. Then, we have proposed recently a\npractical method to generate such EPR states [6]. That\nis, more entangled states are obtained from a pair of\nsqueezed vacuum states via swapping by performing the\nnumber-phase Bell measurement. In particular, the resultant states are maximally entangled by adjusting the\ntwo squeezing parameters to the same value. This may\nbe viewed as entanglement concentration [7]. The number state teleportation can be performed by using these\nnumber-phase Bell states. It is noticed in this teleportation that some manipulations are made such as shift\nand truncation of photon number states and also scaling\nof amplitudes by the ratio of two squeezing parameters.\nIn this way, teleportation protocols may be considered\nat the same time as those to manipulate input states\nby projectictive measurements with EPR resources (irrespective of teleportation fidelity). In fact, quantum\nscissors protocol is investigated for number state truncation by projective measurement [8, 9, 10]. Therefore, we\nmay expect that various manipulations of number states\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: kitagawa@nucleng.kyoto-u.ac.jp\n\u2020 Electronic address: yamamoto@nucleng.kyoto-u.ac.jp\n\nare implemented via teleportation without knowing the\ninput states. This method can also be used to transfer\nto the output states the quantum information encoded\nin the EPR resources.\nIn this article, we examine various manipulations of\nnumber states based on teleportation using projective\nmeasurement of Bell state with certain number sum.\nFor this purpose, EPR resources with number difference 0 and those with number sum N are found to\nbe useful. These essential ingredients for teleportation,\nEPR resources and projective measurements, will be realized experimentally with linear optics, specifically beam\nsplitters, phase shifters and zero-one-photon detectors.\nSqueezed vacuum states are used as primary entanglement resource, while single-photon sources are not required. This may be an interesting point in the present\nscheme.\nIn Sec. II we consider the desired EPR resources.\nThen, in Sec. III we describe how the projective measurements to the number sum Bell states are realized\nwith linear optics. In Sec. IV some basic manipulations\nare obtained via number state teleportations with these\nEPR resources and the number sum measurement, and\nthen by combining these tools various manipulations are\nconstructed. Sec. V is devoted to summary.\n\nII.\n\nEPR RESOURCE\n\nWe begin with examining the EPR resource which may\nbe shared by Bob and Alice for number state teleportation. We present in the following two kinds of EPR\nresources with certain number difference and sum, respectively, and consider their characteristic properties.\n\nA.\n\nNumber difference resource\n\nAn EPR state with number difference 0 is given generally with amplitude distribution d = (d1 , d2 , . . .) by\n(\u2212)\n\n|EPRi12 = |0, di12 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=0\n\ndk |ki1 |ki2 .\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nAmong such states, squeezed vacuum states generated\nby parametric down conversion may be primarily interesting. They are used widely as entanglement resource\nin various experiments utilizing photons. A two-mode\nsqueezed vacuum state is described as\n|\u03bbi12 = (1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )1/2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=0\n\n\u03bbk |ki1 |ki2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the squeezing parameter. This non-uniform\nnumber distribution with \u03bb < 1 in Eq. (2) is attributed\nto the fact that the Fock space is infinite dimensional\nwhile the energy should be finite for the physical states.\nHence, the squeezed vacuum states are not maximally\nentangled. We may also use a photon-subtracted state\nwhich is generated from a squeezed vacuum state [11]:\nr\n\u221e\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )3 X\n(k + 1)\u03bbk |ki1 |ki2 .\n(3)\n|\u03bb, \u22121i12 =\n1 + \u03bb2\n\nAs proposed in Ref. [6], we can generate the numberphase Bell states by performing the number-phase measurement on a pair of squeezed vacuum states. Two\nsqueezed vacuum states, 1-3 system and 2-4 system, are\nrearranged via swapping (1-3, 2-4) \u2192 (1-2, 3-4) as\n|\u03bbi13 |\u03bb\u2032 i24 = (1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )1/2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u20322 )1/2\nN\nX\n\n\u00d7\n\nm=0\n\n\u221e\nX\nK(\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 , N )\n\u221a\nN +1\nN =0\n\n|N, \u2212mi34 |N, m, ri12 .\n\n(8)\n\nHere, the generalized Bell states are introduced as\n\u221a\nN\n\u2217\nm k\n\u03bbN N + 1 X [(\u03c9N\n+1 ) ]\n\u221a\nrk |N \u2212 ki1 |ki2\n|N, m, ri12 =\nK(\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 , N )\nN\n+\n1\nk=0\n(9)\nwith the ratio of the squeezing parameters\n\nk=0\n\nEPR states with number difference \u2206N 6= 0 may further\nbe used, with which the photon number shift is induced\nvia teleportation. They are, however, not considered in\nthe following, since the number shift of \u2206N = \u00d1 \u2212 N is\nalso realized by taking number sum N EPR states and\nnumber sum \u00d1 measurement, as seen in Sec. IV.\nB.\n\nWe next consider EPR states with number sum N . An\nN -photon entangled state is given generally by\n(+)\n\nN\nX\n\nk=0\n\ndk |N \u2212 ki1 |ki2 .\n\n(4)\n\nSpecifically, we consider the Bell states of number sum\nand phase difference [6, 12, 13],\n|N, mi12 =\n\nN\n\u2217\nX\n[(\u03c9N\n)m ]k\n\u221a +1\n|N \u2212 ki1 |ki2 ,\nN +1\nk=0\n\n(5)\n\nwhere m = 0, 1, . . . , N mod N + 1 (|N, \u22121i12 \u2261 |N, N i12 ,\netc), and the (N + 1)-root is given by\n\u03c9N +1 \u2261 exp [i2\u03c0/(N + 1)] , (\u03c9N +1 )N +1 = 1.\n\n(6)\n\nThese Bell states with number sum N are also the eigenstates of the suitably defined Hermitian operator of phase\ndifference, and the eigenvalues are given by\n)\n\u03c6(N\nm =\n\n2\u03c0\nm.\nN +1\n\n(10)\n\nand the normalization factor\nK(\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 , N ) =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03bb2(N +1) \u2212 \u03bb\u20322(N +1)\n\u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb\u20322\n\n\u00151/2\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nThen, the generalized Bell state |N, m, ri12 is obtained\nby the number-phase measurement of |N, \u2212mi34 :\n\nNumber sum resource\n\n|EPRi12 = |N, di12 =\n\nr = \u03bb\u2032 /\u03bb\n\n(7)\n\nHere an arbitrary nonzero reference phase may be in(N )\ncluded in \u03c6m by a phase shift of the mode 2 as a2 \u2192\ni\u03c6\ne a2 in Eq. (5), though it does not change the following\ninvestigations.\n\n|\u03bbi13 |\u03bb\u2032 i24 \u21d2 |N, m, ri12 .\n\n(12)\n\nIn particular, they are maximally entangled by adjusting\nthe squeezing parameters as \u03bb = \u03bb\u2032 , i.e.,\n\u03bb=\u03bb\u2032\n\n|N, m, ri12 \u2212\u2192 |N, mi12 \u2261 |N, m, 1i12 .\n\n(13)\n\nThe probability to obtain the specific Bell state\n|N, m, ri12 by measuring |N, \u2212mi34 is given from Eq. (8)\nas\nP (N, \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) =\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u20322 )\u03bb2N 1 \u2212 r2(N +1)\n. (14)\nN +1\n1 \u2212 r2\n\nThis probability is evaluated for the typical cases of r as\n\uf8f1\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03042 )\u03bb\u03042N\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n(r2 \u226b 1, r2 \u226a 1)\n\u2032\nN\n+\n1\nP (N, \u03bb, \u03bb ) \u2248\n, (15)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n2 2 2N\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb ) \u03bb\n(r \u2248 1)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u0304 = max[\u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ]. It is then estimated for generic r\nwith optimal value of \u03bb\u0304 \u2248 [1 \u2212 (N + 1)\u22121 ]1/2 \u2248 0.7 \u2212 0.9\nfor 1 \u2264 N \u2264 5 as\nP (N, \u03bb, \u03bb\u2032 ) \u223c\n\np(N )\n,\ne(N + 1)2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere [1 \u2212 (N + 1)\u22121 ]N \u2248 1/e for N \u226b 1 is considered. The success probability p(N ) for the measurement\n\n\f3\nof |N, \u2212mi34 is included henceforth, as will be given in\nEq. (42), since it may be done conditionally.\nThere are of course other maximally entangled N photon states than the number-phase\nBell states, e.g.,\n\u221a\n(|2i1 |0i2 + i|1i1 |1i2 + |0i1 |1i2 )/ 3 with N = 2. Some\ngeneral methods to obtain N -photon entangled states\nhave been investigated by utilizing linear optical devices\n[14, 15].\n\nIII.\n\nNUMBER SUM MEASUREMENT\n\nWe adopt the measurement resulting in projection to\ncertain Bell state with number sum \u00d1 ,\n(+)\n\n|Belli01 = |\u00d1 , d\u0303i01 =\n\n\u00d1\nX\nl=0\n\nd \u0303l |\u00d1 \u2212 li0 |li1 ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u00d1 may or may not be equal to N of the EPR\n(+)\nresource |N, di12 . Actually, as shown in Fig. 1, the\n(+)\nnumber sum measurement for the Bell state |\u00d1 , d\u0303i01\nmay be performed with some probability by setting suitably linear optical elements, i.e., beam splitters, phase\nshifters and zero-one-photon detectors. This method is\nbased on the idea of photon chopping [16, 17]. Since the\ntotal number of photons is conserved through this linear\noptical set, the number sum \u00d1 is measured as the total count of photon detections. The aim of the present\nanalysis is to provide various manipulations of photon\nnumber states with linear optics, and hence we assume\nfor clarity that the zero-one-photon detectors can ideally\ndiscriminate the photon numbers n = 0, 1 and more.\nThe estimate of efficiency in actual experiments with\nimperfect detectors will be presented elsewhere specifically for the manipulations of qubits and qutrits. The\nsingle-photon detection is essential and quite challenging for realizing quantum communication and processing with photon number states. It is indeed encouraging\nthat some significant developments and new proposals\nhave been made for single-photon detection to achieve\nthe quantum efficiency close to unity [18, 19].\n(+)\nThe projection to the number sum Bell state |\u00d1 , d\u0303i01\nin Eq.

Generally, it\nshould be noted that any unitary transformation of U(N )\namong N photon modes can be realized in this way [20].\nThe number-phase Bell measurement can be done for the\ncases of \u00d1 = 0, 1 by using a 50/50 beam splitter with\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(c, s, \u03be, \u03b7)(01) = (1/ 2, 1/ 2, 1, 1),\n\n(28)\n\nas shown in Fig. 2.

These Bell states with number sum \u00d1 = 0, 1 can\nbe determined completely with the 50/50 beam splitter from\nthe result of the two photon detectors, when they both detect\nthe vacuum or one photon states.\n\nThe projective measurement of |\u00d1 , 0i01 may be done\npractically with linear optics. The measurement of\n|0, 0i01 with \u00d1 = 0 and |1, 0i01 , |1, 1i01 with \u00d1 = 1\nis made at the same time through a 50/50 beam splitter with photon countings on the two output ports, as is\nwell known. For the case of |2, 0i01 with \u00d1 = 2, we have\nrecently proposed a conditional method, which would be\nextended to the cases of \u00d1 \u2265 3.

On the other hand, if\nwe detect one photon in the mode 0\u2032 (1\u2032 ) and none in the\nmode 1\u2032 (0\u2032 ), we measure the state |1, 0i01 (|1, 1i01 ). The\nother results of the photon detectors indicate the states\nwith number sum more than 1. In this special case with\n\u00d1 = 0, 1, the Bell measurement can be done completely\nwith success probability\np(\u00d1 = 0, 1) = 1.\n\n(31)\n\nThe measurement of Bell state |2, 0i01 with \u00d1 = 2 can\nbe done conditionally, as shown in Fig. 3, introducing\none ancilla mode \"a\". A series of unitary transformations\nsuch as given in Eq.

By adjusting suitably the parameters of beam splitters, as given in the text,\nthe Bell state |\u00d1 = 2, m\u0303 = 0i to be measured is identified\nconditionally when the specific output state |0i0\u2032 |1i1\u2032 |1ia\u2032 is\nobtained by the three photon detectors.\n\nwhere gm\u0303 \u2261\nand \". . .\" represents the other orthogonal states. It is here possible to adjust the parameters\nof the linear operation U so as to give\ng0 6= 0, g1 = 0, g2 = 0.\nThe relevant parameters are taken for example as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(c, s, \u03b7, \u03be)(0a) =\n,\n, 1, 1 ,\n2\n2\n!\nr\n1+i\n2 1\n,\n, \u221a , 1, \u221a\n(c, s, \u03b7, \u03be)(1a) =\n3\n3\n2\n!\nr\nr\n3\n5\n3+i\n.\n(c, s, \u03b7, \u03be)(01) =\n,\u2212\n, 1, \u221a\n8\n8\n10\n\n(40)\n(41)\n\nThen, the state |2, 0i01 |0ia only has the component of\n|0i0\u2032 |1i1\u2032 |1ia\u2032 , while the states |2, 1i01 |0ia and |2, 2i01 |0ia\ndo not. This means that if we observe the state\n|0i0\u2032 |1i1\u2032 |1ia\u2032 with \u00d1 = 2 by the photon detectors, we\nmeasure the desired state |2, 0i01 . The probability to\ndetect |0i0\u2032 |1i1\u2032 |1ia\u2032 as the conditional measurement of\n|2, 0i01 is determined with the above parameters as\np(\u00d1 = 2) = |g0 |2 = 3/8.\n\nNumber difference resource\n(\u2212)\n\nThe output state using an EPR resource |0, di12 with\nnumber difference 0 is given as\n\n(38)\n\n(39)\n\n(42)\n\nSimilarly, we can measure the Bell states |2, \u00b11i01 .

Single-photon quantumnondemolition detectors with linear optics and projective\nmeasurements have been considered recently [22]. This\nquantum extractor in fact acts as N -photon quantumnondemolition detector for N = 0, 1, 2, and so on. The\nsuccess probability is estimated in Eq.

The manipulations (a) and (d) are indicated with dotted boxes. It\nis also seen that the (d) is composed of the two (a)'s,\nas described in Eq. (66). The photon-subtracted EPR\nresource in Eq. (3) for the manipulation (b) is also obtained in these diagrams by attaching a beam splitter\nand a single-photon detector to each mode of a squeezed\nvacuum state [11]. In this way, these manipulations form\na semi-group as chains of the EPR resources and Bell\nmeasurements. The inverse, however, does not exist for\nany of them, since the number state is truncated by the\nnumber sum \u00d1 of the Bell measurement.\nThe number state manipulations may also be applied\nto the multi-mode states. It is interesting that the truncated but ideally squeezed vacuum state is obtained by\nperforming the (d) scaling of r = 1/\u03bb on the one mode\nof |\u03bbi so as to cancel the squeezing parameter \u03bb < 1. It\nachieves maximal entanglement with \u03bb = 1 in Eq.

It will be relevant to the present investigation for\nteleportation-based manipulations. While we have used\nspecific EPR resources so far, we may prepare on demand the EPR resources as templates for certain manipulations. For example, if we prepare the N -photon EPR\n(+)\nresource |N, di12 with dN1 = 0 for only one component\nof k = N1 in d, we obtain the quantum filter of |N1 i\nstate. In this way, we can make various manipulations of\nnumber states via teleportation with number sum measurement.\n\n\f9\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn summary, we have investigated the number state\nmanipulation based on teleportation with number sum\nmeasurement. In the present scheme, squeezed vacuum\nstates with number difference 0 are used as primary\nentanglement resource, while single-photon sources are\nnot required. The projective measurement of the Bell\nstate with certain number sum and phase difference 0 is\nadopted specifically as the number sum measurement,\nwhich may be done with linear optical elements, i.e.,\nbeam splitters, phase shifters and zero-one-photon detectors. The number-phase Bell states as N -photon EPR\nresource are really generated from a pair of squeezed vac-\n\n[1] C. H. Bennett, G. Brassard, C. Crepeau, R. Jozsa,\nA. Peres, and W. K. Wootters, Phys.
