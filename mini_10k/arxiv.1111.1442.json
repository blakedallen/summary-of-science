Three parameters (b,Z,g) characterize the dendrimer lattice model\nin Fig.1: the number of branches b attached to the focal point, the connectivity Z of a site and the number\nof generations g. Many natural systems are dendrimers\nand molecular engineering can produce custom dendrimers with constituents that range from carbon-based\nmolecules [3] to organo-metallic compounds [4, 5]. Potential applications include drug delivery for chemotherapy [3], gene therapy [6], magnetic resonance imaging as\ncontrast agents based on superparamagnetism [7], and\nmolecular recognition [8].\nBethe lattices (BL) or Cayley trees are theoretical\nmodels of dendrimers and attractive approximations of\nsolid-state systems. We consider in this paper superparamagnetic dendrimers based on sites with unpaired\nspins. BL's are fundamentally one-dimensional (1D) systems, without any closed loops, that can be divided by\ncutting any bond. Their distinctive feature is exponential\ngrowth with g. Half of the sites for the BL with Z = 3\nin Fig. 1 are on the surface in generation g. BL's are\nbipartite: all nearest neighbor (NN) bonds in Fig.1 are\nbetween sites in even and odd g that define two sublattices with different numbers of sites. The BL has open\nboundary conditions, a focal point at g = 0 and an arbitrarily large boundary g. General theorems apply for the\nspectrum free electrons [9] with NN transfer t in a BL or\nfor spins [10] with NN Heisenberg exchange J > 0. Three\nparameters generate a rich variety of BL(b, Z, g). In dynamical mean field theory [11], the BL density of states\n\nFIG. 1: One arm of a Bethe lattice with b = Z = 3 and\ng = 5. The other two arms are shown to generation g = 1; g\nalso represents distance from the focal point.\n\nwith infinite connectivity is used as an initial guess for\nthe density of states in higher dimensions. BLs are models for strongly correlated systems [12], alloys [13] and\ndisordered systems [14]. The present study addresses antiferromagnetic (AF) Heisenberg exchange J > 0 in the\nBL with b = Z = 3\nH(g) =\n\nX\nhi,ji\n\nJ s~i * s~j\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nThe sum hi, ji is over all NN for either s = 1/2 or\ns = 1 sites. BL-Ising models limited to szi szj interactions\nhave been used to study finite spin glasses [15]. The\nelectronic properties of correlated BL models still pose\nmany challenges.\nRecent advances in numerical techniques and computational resources have been applied to BL models.\nMethods include exact diagonalization (ED), quantum\nMonte Carlo (QCM) [16] and Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) [17]. DMRG is particularly\nwell suited for 1D systems such as Hubbard or extended\nHubbard models, t \u2212 J models and Heisenberg or related\nspin models. DMRG yields accurate properties for the\nground state (gs) or low-energy excited states [18\u201321].\nThe DMRG challenge for a BL is the large number of\nsurface sites in Fig. 1. Otsuka [22] applied DMRG to\nthe BL, Eq. 1, with s = 1/2 sites and axially anisotropic\nNN exchange (XXZ model). Friedman [23] presented\nanother DMRG algorithm for Eq. 1 with s = 1/2.\nLepetit et al. [24] used essentially the same algorithm to\ntreat the Hubbard model version of Eq. 1 that reduces\nto J = 4t2 /U for s = 1/2 when the on-site repulsion\nU is large compared NN electron transfer t. They also\nsolved analytically the H\u00fcckel or tight-binding model\nwith U = 0.\nDMRG is a truncation procedure in which insignificant degrees of freedom of the system block, the right\nor left block in a chain, are discarded at each step with\nincreasing system size. In 1D chains, the superblock\nconsists of two blocks with dimension m and two sites\nwith p degrees of freedom. The superblock dimension\nis m2 \u00d7 p2 , with p = 2s + 1 in spin systems. The\nsuperblock of BL(3, 3, g) has three blocks and hence goes\nas m3 . More branches b increases the computational\nrequirements. Otsuka [22] used four blocks and two new\nsites for BL(3, 3, g) with p = 2 (s = 1/2). His superblock\nincreased as m4 \u00d7 p2 . The Friedman algorithm [23] with\nb = 3 and four new sites yields a superblock dimension\nof m3 \u00d7 p4 . The DMRG algorithm in Section II has a\nsuperblock dimension m3 \u00d7 p or, more generally, mb \u00d7 p,\nthat makes s = 1 sites accessible.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II presents\nand tests the new algorithm. Section III reports results\nfor the BL in Fig. 1 and Eq. 1 up to g = 11 for s = 1/2\nand 1 sites, and up to g > 20 for hsz0 i at the focal point.\nWe obtain the gs energy per site, the energy gap \u2206 that\ngoverns the gs magnetization and gs expectation values of\nszn for n \u2264 g. We find spin correlation functions between\nthe focal point and other sites and their convergence with\nincreasing g. Section IV relates the DMRG results to a\nsimple analytical model with localized states, to previous\nDMRG studies and to the question of long-range order\nin the infinite BL.\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic representation of BL growth from g = 1\nat step 1 to g = p at step p. The blocks A = B = C at step g\nare given by Eq. 2. The focal point D is the new site added\nat each step.\n\nII.\n\nDMRG ALGORITHM\n\nIn this section, we present a new DMRG algorithm for\nthe BL in Fig. 1 with b = Z = 3. The principal change\nis how the lattice is grown. The total number of sites in\nBL(3, 3, g) is\nNT (g) = 1 + 3(2g \u2212 1)\n\n(2)\n\nThe first step in Fig. 2 contains four sites. Sites A, B\nand C are blocks each of whose size is 2g\u22121 at generation\ng. The focal point D is the new site added at each step.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, each block A = B = C contains three\nsites in the second step for g = 2. Growth at step g = 2,\n3, ... is schematically represented as\n\nAg+1 =\n\nAg\n\n\u2605\n\u2605\n\nDg\n\n\u275d\n\u275d\n\nAg\n(3)\n\nDg is connected to the focal point D at step g + 1. The\nnext step gives blocks of 7 sites at g = 3, and so on up to\nthe BL with NT (g) sites. The procedure for BL(3,3,g)\nholds for other b and Z.\nThe infinite DMRG algorithm for the BL proceeds\nalong largely standard lines [17]: 1. Start with the superblock matrix of four sites and find the eigenvalues of\n\n\f3\nTABLE I: The difference \u03b4X between ED and DMRG with\nincreasing m for BL(3,3,3) with s=1/2 sites, where X is the\ngs energy per site \u01eb0 , excitation energy \u2206, the boundary spin\nhsz3 i and spin correlation hsz1 sz3 i\n\u03b4\u2206 \u00d7 104\n\n10\n20\n30\n50\n\n2670.8\n560.08\n552.99\n0.001\n\n42.593\n41.441\n41.212\n0.0008\n\n\u03b4hsz3 i \u00d7 104\n89.48\n0.030\n0.031\n0.003\n\n\u03b4hsz0 sz3 i \u00d7 105\n-1.193\n-0.722\n-0.801\n-0.0001\n\nH. 2. Use the eigenvectors of the superblock to construct\nthe density matrix of the new blocks Ag+1 , initially for\ng = 1. Keep the eigenvectors of the m largest eigenvalues,\nwith m chosen as discussed below. The density matrix\ndimension is m2 \u00d7 p, where m and p refer to the block\nand degrees of freedom of the new site. Full diagonalization of the density matrix is carried out separately for\nlarge m in sectors with different total S z . 3. Renormalize the Hamiltonian of the new blocks and the operators\nthat are necessary for the next step. These steps follow\nconventional DMRG [17]. 4. Construct the next (g +\n1) superblock from the three renormalized blocks Ag+1\nand the new site. Diagonalize the matrix and retain the\nm lowest eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Repeat steps 2-4\nuntil the desired system size is reached.\nThe superblock dimension of m3 \u00d7 p makes possible larger m that increases the accuracy and larger\np = 2s + 1. We can use m = 60 without much computational effort and find 10\u221213 or less for the weight of the\ndiscarded eigenvalues of blocks. DMRG is a variational\nmethod. Energies and correlation functions for given size\ng converge better for finite DMRG [17]. We followed the\nstandard approach of sweeping back and forth through\ndifferent blocks. Care has to be taken in designing the finite DMRG algorithm due to the BL's complex structure.\nWe constructed the density matrix with equal weight\nfor the lowest two eigenstates. As a first test of accuracy,\nwe performed ED on BL(3,3,3) with 22 sites s=1/2 and\non BL(3,3,2) with 10 sites s=1. There are 222 and 310\nspin states, respectively. DMRG results with increasing\nm must eventually converge to ED. The evolution of the\ngs energy per site, \u03b4\u01eb0 = \u01eb0 (m) \u2212 \u01eb0 (ED), with m is\nshown in Table I for the 22 sites systems. Also shown\nare the evolution of \u03b4hsz3 i and the spin correlation \u03b4hsz0 sz3 i\nbetween the focal point and the boundary. DMRG with\nm = 50 is quantitative here. The Friedman algorithm\nwhose super block increases as m3 \u00d7 p4 is limited to m \u2248\n30 and returns [23] \u03b4\u01eb0 = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 with m = 29 for\ninfinite DMRG, which is comparable to m = 10 in Table\nI.

The inset\nshows the m-dependence of the energy gap \u2206 to the ground\nstate with S z = S(10) + 1\n\nWe chose m = 60 on the basis of BL calculations\nfor large systems with g = 10. Figure 3 shows the\nevolution of \u01eb0 (m)/\u01eb0 (65) with m for s = 1/2 and 1 sites.\nAlthough s=1 converges an order of magnitude more\nslowly, m > 40 is adequate in either case. Preliminary\nresults indicate still slower convergence for s=3/2 sites.\nThe inset of Fig. 3 shows the slower, and not the\nmonotonic, evolution of energy gap \u2206(m)/\u2206(65). This\nis not unexpected since \u2206 is the difference between two\nextensive quantities.\nWe followed the first excited state in S z = S(g) with\nsimilar results. We kept m = 60 and did 8 sweeps of finite\nDMRG for the results in Section III. We estimate that the\ngs energy, spin densities and spin correlation functions\nare accurate to 4-5 decimal places in larger systems, while\nenergy gaps are accurate to 2-3 places.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS FOR BL WITH S = 1/2 AND 1\n\nIn general, a BL of NT sites has NT \u2212 1 bonds, since\nonly the focal point is not connected to a site with lower\ng. The gs energy per bond of BL(3,3,g) is\n\u01eb0 (g) = E0 (g)/(NT (g) \u2212 1)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere E0 is the gs energy and NT is given in Eq. 2.\nFig. 5 shows \u01eb0 (g) for s = 1/2 and 1 sites up to g =\n10.

The gap \u2206(g)\nto the gs in the S z = S(g) + 1 sector governs the gs\nmagnetization. The evolution of \u2206(g) with NT (g) is\nshown in Fig. 5. The substantial gap of the extended\nsystem is discussed in Section IV. We also found doubly\ndegenerate excitations \u2206\u2032 (g), comparable to \u2206(g), in the\nS z (g) sector for both s = 1/2 and 1. The C3 symmetry\nof the BL leads naturally to E states. Since we compute\nS z rather than S, the gs automatically appears also in\nsectors with S z < S z (g). The second and third excited\nstates for S z = S z (g)\u2212 1 decrease with NT (g) and vanish\nin the extended system within our numerical accuracy.\nThe gs expectation values of hszp i in generation p\nare listed in Table II for the BL with g = 10. The g\n= 9 and 11 results are almost the same. The gs has\nlong-range order (LRO) that corresponds to staggered\nmagnetization in successive generations. The largest\nhszp i is at the boundary, p = g. The smallest magnitude\nis at p = g \u2212 1 next to the boundary, and |hszn i| near the\nfocal point become equal for large g. The convergence of\n|hsz0 i| to 0.348 is shown in Fig. 6 up to g = 26, a huge BL\nof 3 \u00d7 226 sites, and agrees with the previous estimate of\n0.35 [24]. The s = 1 limit up the g = 24 is |hsz0 i| = 0.83,\nand the staggered magnetization of both gs becomes\nconstant near the focal point for g > 10. By contrast,\na half-filled BL of free electron has hsz0 i = 2/(g + 1) for\nodd g and hsz0 i = 0 for even g or in the extended system.\nTable II also lists the gs expectation values of h~sp\u22121 *~sp i\nin successive generations of BL(3,3,10) with s = 1/2\nand 1 sites.

The BL-Ising model has hszp i = (\u22121)p s\nand hszp\u22121 szp i = \u2212s2 . Table II shows that s = 1 is\ncloser to the Ising model than s = 1/2, where quantum\nfluctuations are larger.\nWe define radial spin correlation functions as\nC(r) = (\u22121)r (hs~0 * s~r i \u2212 hsz0 ihszr i)\n\n(5)\n\nwith r = 1, 2...g. The mean-field contribution is explicitly excluded. As seen in Fig. 7, C(r) decreases as\nexp(\u2212\u03b1r) with \u03b1 = 0.80 for both s = 1/2 and 1.

C(r) is almost completely\ndue to transverse spin components. Since the number\nof boundary sites goes as n(g) = 1.5exp(gln2), we have\nn(g)C(g) \u2192 0 for large g.\nThe gs degeneracy is lifted when an applied magnetic\nfield h is added to Eq. 1. The lowest Zeeman level goes\nas \u2212hS(g). With increasing h, the gs becomes the lowest\nZeeman level of a state with S z > S(g), an excited state\nat h = 0.

The inset shows the z component,\nC z (r).\n\nDMRG results for H(g) in Eq. 1 are similar for\nBLs with s = 1/2 and 1 sites in Fig. 1. The gs has\nS(g) = 2g s as expected on general grounds. The larger\nsublattice has NA (2) = 2g+1 \u2212 1 sites and the smaller\nhas NB (g) = 2g \u2212 1 sites. The difference NA (g) \u2212 NB (g)\nis 2g . As seen in Table II, the gs has staggered magnetization with LRO and AF spin correlations in successive\ngenerations. Spin correlation functions C(r) in Fig. 8\ndecay rapidly and exponentially. Magnetization has a\nsubstantial gap \u2206(g) that remains finite in the extended\ns = 1/2 or 1 system.\nWe interpret these results in terms of a simple analytical approximation. We partition H(g) with J = 1 in Eq.\n1 as H = H0 + V ,\n\n\f6\nin states with S < S(g) for either s = 1/2 or 1 sites.\nH0 = NB (g)h(3)\nh(3) = s~2 * (s~1 + s~3 )\n\n(7)\n\nThe trimer h(3) is elementary and H0 accounts for exactly 2/3 of the exchanges. For example, the outermost\ntwo generations of BL(3,3,5) in Fig. 1 contain eight\ntrimers per arm. Each s = 1/2 trimer has a gs with\ns = 1/2 at e0 = \u22121, another doublet at e = 0 and a\nquartet, s = 3/2, at e = 1/2. The gs of an s = 1 trimer\nis e0 = \u22123. The perturbation V contains an extra site q\nin the larger sublattice and remaining exchanges. Each\nof NA (q) choices of q uniquely defines the sites of NB (g)\ntrimers. The middle and end sites are necessarily in\nthe smaller and larger sublattice, respectively, and all\nexchanges in V are between a middle and end site. There\nis only one kind of trimer-trimer or trimer-q interaction.\nThe gs energy of H0 for s = 1/2 and 1 sites is \u2212NB (g)\nand \u22123NB (g), respectively. Spin correlation functions of\nadjacent sites for s = 1/2 and 1 are\nhs~1 * s~2 i = \u22121/2, \u22123/2.\n\n(8)\n\nThe spin densities of the central and terminal sites for s\n= 1/2 are\n\nSite q is a NN of one middle site when q is in\ngeneration g and of three middle sites otherwise. The\nsecond term of Eq. 12 is more negative for q \u2264 g \u2212 2\nthan for q = g by 2hsz2 i(s \u2212 hsz1 i) for s = 1/2 or 1.\nTo first order in V , site q in not on the boundary and\ng, g \u2212 1 in Fig. 1 are trimers with end sites g. H0\naccounts for all exchanges between generations g and\ng \u2212 1 while V contains all exchanges between g \u2212 1 and\ng \u2212 2. The trimer approximation leads to hszg i = 1/3\nand hszg\u22121 i = \u22121/6, compared to 0.40 and -0.25 for\nDMRG for s = 1/2 sites in Table II. The correlation\nfunctions are h~sg\u22121 * ~sg i = \u22121/2 compared to -0.44 for\nDMRG. Trimers have reduced h~sg\u22122 * ~sg\u22121 i = \u22121/18,\nwell below the DMRG result of -0.30 but consistent with\nreduced correlation in g \u2212 1 and g \u2212 2. The s = 1 BL\nhas hszg i = 3/4 and hszg\u22121 i = \u22121/2 in the trimer approximation and 0.87, -0.69 in DMRG (Table 2). Trimers\nhave h~sg\u22121 *~sg i = \u22123/2 for s=1 while DMRG gives -1.397.\nA trimer of s = 1/2 sites must be excited to a quartet\nstate s = 3/2 with excitation energy 3/2 under H0 to obtain S z = S(g)+1. One of the NB (g) trimers in \u03a8(0) (q, g)\nis changed to |\u03c6i = |\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1i. A normalized function with\na quartet is\n\n2hsz2 i = \u22121/3 , 2hsz1 i = 2/3,\n\n(9)\n\nY\n\n(q, g)i = |\u03b1q i\n\nm=1\n\nThe quartet is delocalized over the BL by the s+ s\u2212 terms\nof V . To first order in V , the excitation energy to S =\nS(g) + 1 is\nh\u03a6|H|\u03a6i \u2212 h\u03a8(0) |H|\u03a8(0) i = \u2206(1) = 1.0\n\nNB (g)\n\n|\u03a8\n\n|\u03c6m i|\u03a8(0) (q, g)i/|\u03c8m i\n(12)\n\nThe corresponding spin densities for s = 1 are \u22121 in the\nmiddle and 3/2 at the ends. The gs of H0 is a product\nover trimers and the spin at q,\n\n(0)\n\nX\n\nNB (g)\n\n|\u03a6(g)i = (NB (g))\u22121/2\n\n|\u03c8j i\n\n(10)\n\nj=1\n\nFirst-order perturbation theory in V lifts the degeneracy\nbetween q in generations g and < g.\nSite q is a 1/NT correction for large g. The energy per\nsite of the infinite BL is, to first order in V,\nh\u03a8(0) |H|\u03a8(0) i/3NB (g) = \u01eb0 (s)/3 + hsz1 ihsz2 i/3 (11)\nParallel spins give lower energy due to the opposite\nsigns of spin densities. The s = 1/2 result is -19/54 =\n0.35185 per site in first order and -0.39082 in second\norder in V , very close the DMRG result of 0.39385 in\nFig. 4. The s = 1 result is -9/8 = 1.125 per site in\nfirst order and -1.3152 in second order, slightly below\n-1.2796 in DMRG. The variational theorem holds for the\nenergy in first order, but not in second order. The first\norder energy is lowest for parallel spins of NB (g) trimers\nand site q that properly gives S z = S(q)s. Moreover,\n\u03a8(0) (q, g) immediately rationalizes low-energy spin flips\n\n(13)\n\nDelocalization lowers the energy by 2/3 while the\ndiagonal sz sz contribution raises the energy by 1/6. The\nnet effect is to lower the excitation from 3/2 to 1 for\ns = 1/2, somewhat above \u2206 = 0.74 for the extended BL\nin Fig. 5.\nThe sharp distinction between NN exchanges in H0\nand V for the outermost three generations is lost in\nthe interior. H0 contains trimers that spans three\ngenerations when q \u2264 g \u2212 2. When q 6= 0, the central\nsite in Fig. 1 is the middle site of a trimer for even\ng and the end site for odd g. Although trimers imply\nintermediate spin density and spin correlations near the\nfocal point, there are variations between even and odd g\nin contrast to identical hsz0 i in Fig. 6. Similarly, C(r)\nin Eq. 5 for \u03a8(0) (q, g) is strictly limited to r = 1 or 2\nsince trimers span at most span three generations. The\nfunction \u03a8(0) (q, g) is localized, more localized than the\nDMRG gs, but it rationalizes DMRG results in some\ndetail.\n\n\f7\nDMRG results for NN exchange J in Eq. 1 for s =\n1/2 and 1 sites in BL(3,3,g) are closely similar, in sharp\ncontrast to the fundamentally different behavior of 1D\nchains of s = 1/2 and 1 sites [25]. The s = 1 chain with\nadditional NN terms J(si * sj )2 /3 in Eq. 1 is a valence\nbond solid (VBS) with rigorously known gs properties\n[26]. The VBS on BL(3,3,g) has s = 3/2 site, yet another\nadded term to Eq. 1, and hsz0 i = 0 and hence no LRO\nin the extended system [26]. Both the spin and Hamiltonian of the VBS are different, and no DMRG has been\nperformed on that system. For Eq. 1, DMRG indicates a\ngs with staggered magnetization and finite hsz0 i in Fig. 6\nat the focal point for either s = 1/2 or 1. The gs has LRO\nand short-range spin correlations C(r) in Eq. 5 that decrease exponentially and more rapidly than the number\nof boundary sites.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe DMRG algorithm in Section II makes it possible\nto treat the BL in Fig. 1 with s = 1 sites. It improves\nthe accuracy for s = 1/2 sites and yields low-energy\n\n[1] D.A. Tomalia and P.R. Dvornic, Nature 372, 617 (2002).\n[2] M.A.M. Delgado, J.R. Laguna, and G. Sierra, Phys.
