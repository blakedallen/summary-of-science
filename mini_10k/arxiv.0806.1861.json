Our generalised model has\na fat-tailed distribution while preserving the invariance under orthogonal, unitary or symplectic\ntransformations. The spectral properties are derived analytically for finite matrix size N \u00d7 M for\nall three \u03b2, in terms of the orthogonal polynomials of the standard Wishart-Laguerre ensembles. For\nlarge-N in a certain double scaling limit we obtain a generalised Mar\u010denko-Pastur distribution on\nthe macroscopic scale, and a generalised Bessel-law at the hard edge which is shown to be universal.\nBoth macroscopic and microscopic correlations exhibit power-law tails, where the microscopic limit\ndepends on \u03b2 and the difference M \u2212 N . In the limit where our parameter governing the power-law\ngoes to infinity we recover the correlations of the Wishart-Laguerre ensembles. To illustrate these\nfindings the generalised Mar\u010denko-Pastur distribution is shown to be in very good agreement with\nempirical data from financial covariance matrices.\n\nDedicated to the 70th birthday of Oriol Bohigas\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nEnsembles of matrices with random entries have been introduced in the pioneering works by Wigner\nand Dyson in the early 1950s, in an attempt to provide a statistical description of energy levels\nof heavy nuclei based on few and minimal symmetry requirements. Today's applications cover all\nareas in Physics, and we refer to [1] for a review. However, many years before Wigner and Dyson,\nJohn Wishart had already introduced a random matrix ensemble in his studies on samples from\na multivariate population. This ensemble of random matrices can be obtained as follows: take a\nrectangular matrix X of size M \u00d7 N (M > N ), whose entries are independent Gaussian variables\nwith mean zero and variance one in the real, complex or quaternion domain, labelled by the Dyson\nindex \u03b2 = 1, 2 and 4, respectively. Then form the (non-normalised) covariance matrix of size N \u00d7 N ,\nW = X\u2020 X, which is positive definite. By comparing to such matrices one can establish which part\nof the spectrum of empirical covariance matrices carries genuine information and which should be\ndiscarded as contaminated by pure noise.\nThe ensemble of such matrices W is known in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) as Wishart, Laguerre\nor chiral ensemble and will be denoted by WL in the following. It has since appeared in many different\ncontexts, such as multivariate statistical data analysis [2], analysis of the capacity of channels with\nmultiple antennae and receivers [3], low-energy Quantum Chromodynamics and other gauge theories\n[4, 5], Quantum Gravity [6, 7], knowledge networks [8], finance [9] and also in statistical physics\nproblems, such as a class of (1 + 1)-dimensional directed polymer problems [10]. Very recent analytical\nresults include statistics of large deviations for the maximum eigenvalue [11] and distributions related\nto entangled random pure states [12].\nBecause of its invariance, the WL ensembles can be written in terms of eigenvalues and completely\nsolved, both for any finite N and M , as well as in the large-N limit. We only give a brief account on\nwhat is known, more details follow in the main part later.\nThe WL ensemble can be exactly solved through the standard orthogonal polynomial technique\n[13]. For a Gaussian weight functions all spectral correlation functions can be expressed at finite-N in\nterms of orthogonal (\u03b2 = 2) or skew orthogonal (\u03b2 = 1, 4) Laguerre polynomials, see [13] for a review.\nIn the large-N limit one has to distinguish between smooth macroscopic, and oscillatory microscopic\ncorrelations on the level of mean spacing between eigenvalues. The most known macroscopic result\nin the spectral density of Mar\u010denko and Pastur (MP) [14], generalising the semi-circle in the WignerDyson class (WD). On the microscopic domain much effort has been spent on the so-called hard edge\nat the origin for the positive definite eigenvalues, which is absent in the WD class. It is governed by\nthe Bessel-law [15, 4, 16, 17, 18] labelled by \u03b2 and M \u2212 N being finite. The robustness or universality\nunder polynomial deformations of the Gaussian weight function has also been proven [19, 20]. This\nperturbation destroys the independence of the uncorrelated degrees of freedom of X, without changing\nthe microscopic correlation functions. Connected macroscopic density correlation functions also remain\nuniversal under such deformations [6].\nWhat is the motivation to further generalise WL ensembles? In the finance and risk management\ndomain, the empirical covariance of a set of N assets over a temporal window of size M has been\nunder scrutiny for some time [9], and its eigenvalues were shown to be distributed in reasonably good\nagreement with the MP law, as if they were originated by a completely uncorrelated data series.\nHowever, the same analysis repeated by several groups [21, 22, 23] on different data sets have shown\nthat either the part of the spectrum corresponding to extremely low eigenvalues - the most interesting\nfor portfolio selections - or the fat tails are not reproduced by this crude approach. This has led to\nthe appearance of more sophisticated models [23, 24, 25], e.g. the multivariate student distribution\nwhere the variance of each matrix entry becomes a random variable. Another deformation of the\nWL ensemble has been introduced in [26] where sparse matrices X were considered. This setting has\n2\n\n\fmany applications in communication theory and in complex networks (namely in the study of spectral\nproperties of adjacency matrices). All these generalisations lead to a deformation of the MP law, and\nthus lie outside the WL class. However, the lack of invariance in such models generically spoils the\ncomplete solvability for all correlations functions.\nConversely, a model with power-law tails which is exactly solvable in principle appeared in [25].\nHowever, the analysis in [25] was restricted to the macroscopic spectral density, whereas many more\ninteresting results, and ultimately a complete solution of the model can be obtained. This goal is\nachieved by exploiting techniques and results introduced in previous works, where the WD class was\ngeneralised using non-standard entropy maximisation [27, 28] and super-statistical approaches [29, 30].\nWe will follow these lines and provide a complete solution for all three \u03b2 of a generalised WL model\nwith rotational invariance, with an emphasis on the issues of universality and complete integrability\nfor all spectral correlations, both macroscopic and microscopic. After a proper rescaling and normalisation, our N -independent correlations depend only on a single parameter \u03b1, given by the power-law.\nIn the limit of a large parameter \u03b1 \u226b 1 we recover all standard WL correlations. For completeness,\nwe also mention another generalisation of WL which exploits a different direction. In [31] the unitary\nWL were generalised to display critical statistics.\nOur paper is organised as follows. In the next section 2 we define our generalised WL ensembles as\na one-parameter deformation, including a general non-Gaussian potential V for all three \u03b2 = 1, 2 and\n4. The general solution for finite-N is given applying the method of (skew) orthogonal polynomials\nto an integral transform of the standard WL ensembles.\nIn the next section 3 we take the macroscopic large-N limit for the special case of a Gaussian\npotential. Here macroscopic refers to the smooth part of the spectrum, considering correlations on\na distance large compared to the mean level-spacing. We rederive a generalisation of the semi-circle\nand MP spectral density, see refs. [27, 28, 29] and [25] respectively. As a new result we compute the\naverage position of an eigenvalue and the position of a pseudo edge. The former leads to the correct\nscaling with N and an N -independent generalised spectral density displaying a power-law decay.\nSection 4 is devoted to the microscopic large-N limit, where correlations on the order of the mean\nlevel-spacing are computed. Here we can use the known universal WL results as an input to our\nmodel. In the case when the difference of the matrix dimension M \u2212 N is kept finite the spectrum has\na hard edge at the origin. In two subsections we compute its microscopic density there, generalising\nthe universal Bessel-law as well as the corresponding smallest eigenvalue distribution for all three \u03b2.\nIn section 5 the nearest neighbour spacing distribution in the bulk of the spectrum is computed\nusing a Wigner surmise at N = 2 for our generalised model.\nOur conclusions and outlook are presented in section 6, including a comparison of the generalised\nMP density to data from financial correlation matrices. In two appendices technical details are collected.\n\n2\n\nDefinition of the model and finite-N solution for general potential\n\nThe joint probability density of our generalised Wishart-Laguerre ensembles is defined as follows in\nterms of matrix elements\n\u0013\u2212\u03b3\n\u0012\nn\u03b2\n\u2020\ndX ,\n(2.1)\nTrV (X X)\nP\u03b3 [X] dX \u221d 1 +\n\u03b3\nwhere X is a matrix of size M \u00d7 N with real, complex or quaternion real elements for the values\n\u03b2 = 1, 2 or 4, respectively. We define M = N + \u03bd for later convenience, where \u03bd \u2265 0 may be either\nfinite or of order O(N ) in the large-N limit. The integration measure dX is defined by integrating\n3\n\n\fover all independent matrix elements of X with a flat measure. Expectation values of an operator O\n(denoted by hOi\u03b3 ) are defined with respect to P\u03b3 in the usual sense.\nThe real positive parameter \u03b3 is to be specified below, and we keep an additional variance-like\nparameter n > 0. The so-called potential V is taken to be a polynomial of finite degree d, although\nsome of the universal results we inherit from the WL ensembles are known to hold for a much larger\nclass of functions.\nThe measure (2.1) is well-defined and integrable only if the following condition holds\n\u03b2\nN (N + \u03bd) .\n(2.2)\n2\nThis condition, which is derived in appendix A, can be seen when changing to radial coordinates for\nthe matrix X\u2020 X, see e.g. [32, 28]. In particular, the large-N behaviour of any spectral property cannot\nbe taken for fixed \u03b3, and a prescription about the way both quantities should approach infinity needs\nto be given, respecting the inequality eq. (2.2).\nA similar model was introduced earlier generalising the (non-chiral) Wigner-Dyson ensembles for\na Gaussian potential [27, 29, 28], and a similar interplay between the deformation parameter \u03b3 and\nthe matrix size N was observed.\nIn the limit of an infinite deformation parameter\n\u03b3d >\n\nlim P\u03b3 [X] = exp[\u2212n\u03b2TrV (X\u2020 X)] \u2261 P[X]\n\n\u03b3\u2192\u221e\n\n(2.3)\n\nwe recover the standard Wishart-Laguerre or chiral ensembles denoted by P[X]. Typically, in these\nensembles one chooses n \u223c N when taking the large-N limit to obtain an N -independent macroscopic\ndensity. In our case, this limit will be more involved, and we will keep n general for the time being.\nThe generalised ensembles can be related to the standard WL through the following integral\nrepresentation:\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u2212\u03b3\nd\u03be e\u2212\u03be \u03be \u03b3\u22121 e\u2212\u03bez .\n(2.4)\n(1 + z) =\n\u0393(\u03b3) 0\nInserting this into the definition eq. (2.1) we obtain\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\nn\u03b2\n1\nTrV (X\u2020 X) .\n(2.5)\nd\u03be e\u2212\u03be \u03be \u03b3\u22121 exp \u2212\u03be\nP\u03b3 [X] =\n\u0393(\u03b3) 0\n\u03b3\n\nThis relation is the key starting point to solve our generalised model both for finite- and large-N .\nThe same trick was used for the generalisation of the Gaussian Wigner-Dyson ensembles introduced\npreviously in [27, 28, 29]. In fact, a similar technique was employed much earlier in [32] when solving\nthe fixed and restricted trace ensembles by writing them as integral transforms of the Wigner-Dyson\nensembles.\nAn advantage of our model over some other generalisations of WL [25, 23] is its invariance under\northogonal, unitary or symplectic transformations. In particular, for \u03b2 = 1 Burda et al. [25] considered\na very general family of probability distributions of the form: Pf [X] \u223c f (TrXT C\u22121 XA\u22121 ) where C\nand A represent the true correlation and autocorrelation matrices respectively, and f is a non-negative\nand normalised weight function. Only in the special case C = A = 1 invariance is recovered. This\napproach has been modified in [23] to allow for a time-dependent random volatility.\nFrom eq. (2.5) (or eq.

We only detail the simpler \u03b2 = 2 case\nhere and briefly outline \u03b2 = 1 and 4, where we refer to [13] for more details.\nLet us define monic orthogonal polynomials and their norms for \u03b2 = 2 as follows\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\n2n\nV (\u03bb) Pk (\u03bb)Pl (\u03bb) = hk \u03b4kl .\n(2.13)\nd\u03bb \u03bb\u03bd exp \u2212\u03be\n\u03b3\n0\nIntroducing their kernel\n\u03bd\n\nn\n\nKN (\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2261 (\u03bb\u03bc) 2 e\u2212\u03be \u03b3 (V (\u03bb)+V (\u03bc))\n\n5\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\nh\u22121\nk Pk (\u03bb)Pk (\u03bc) ,\n\n(2.14)\n\n\fand applying the Christoffel-Darboux identity for \u03bb 6= \u03bc\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u22121\nh\u22121\nk Pk (\u03bb)Pk (\u03bc) = hN \u22121\n\nk=0\n\nPN (\u03bb)PN \u22121 (\u03bc) \u2212 PN (\u03bc)PN \u22121 (\u03bb)\n,\n\u03bb\u2212\u03bc\n\n(2.15)\n\nwe can express all eigenvalue correlations of the standard ensemble through this kernel [13],\nR(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbk ; \u03be) =\n\ndet [KN (\u03bbi , \u03bbj )] .\n\n1\u2264i,j\u2264k\n\n(2.16)\n\nWe thus arrive at\nR\u03b3 (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbk ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03be e\u2212\u03be \u03be \u03b3\u22121\n\n0\n\nZ(\u03be)\n\u0393(\u03b3)Z\u03b3\n\ndet [KN (\u03bbi , \u03bbj )] ,\n\n1\u2264i,j\u2264k\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhich is the main result of this section. The simplest example is the spectral density\nR \u221e R\u03b3 (\u03bb) given by\nthe integral over the single kernel KN (\u03bb, \u03bb). Notice that it is normalised to N = 0 d\u03bbR\u03b3 (\u03bb).\nIn order to take N large we only need to know the asymptotic of the polynomials PN , take a finite\ndeterminant of size k of the asymptotic kernel and integrate once with respect to \u03be. In appendix B the\northogonal polynomials, the corresponding densities and partition functions are worked out in detail\nfor finite-N and a Gaussian potential V (\u03bb) = \u03bb at \u03b2 = 2, given in terms of Laguerre polynomials and\ntheir norms.\nAs pointed out already the same result eq. (2.17) holds for \u03b2 = 1 and 4 when replacing the\ndeterminant by a Pfaffian, Pf[\u03baN (\u03bbi , \u03bbj )], where \u03baN is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix kernel. For a Gaussian weight its\nskew orthogonal polynomials are explicitly known as well in terms of Laguerre polynomials [17, 18].\nFor completeness, we also give the partition function occurring inside the integrand in eq. (2.17)\nin terms of the norms hi of orthogonal polynomials\nZ(\u03be) = N !\n\nN\n\u22121\nY\n\nhi = N ! hN\n0\n\ni=0\n\nN\n\u22121\nY\n\nriN \u2212i ,\n\n(2.18)\n\ni=0\n\n. An identical result holds for \u03b2 = 1 and 4 in terms of the skew orthogonal\nor their ratios ri \u2261 hhi+1\ni\nnorms [13].\nIn the Gaussian case the ratio of partition functions Z(\u03be)/\u0393(\u03b3)Z\u03b3 in eq. (2.17) can be obtained\nmost explicitly at finite-N for all 3 values of \u03b2 by changing to radial coordinates, see appendix A for\na derivation.\n\n3\n\nMacroscopic large-N limit for a Gaussian potential\n\nIn this section, we will restrict ourselves to the Gaussian potential V (\u03bb) = \u03bb, deriving a generalisation\nof the MP spectral density of WL for all three \u03b2. It exhibits a non-compact support and power-law\nbehaviour for large arguments, and we will distinguish two cases. In the first subsection, we will deal\nwith matrices that become asymptotically quadratic with M \u2212 N = \u03bd = O(1). In the standard WL\nensembles, at large-N the spectral support is an interval on the positive semi-axis, where the origin\nrepresents a hard edge. In the second subsection, we take the limit\nN\n\u2261 c,\nM,N \u2192\u221e M\nlim\n\n(3.1)\n\nwith c < 1, corresponding to the case M \u2212 N = \u03bd = O(N ). In the WL ensembles, the resulting MP\nmacroscopic spectral density takes support on a positive interval. Conversely, in both cases c = 1 and\nc < 1 our generalised macroscopic density will have support on the full positive real semi-axis.\n6\n\n\f3.1\n\nGeneralised semi-circle for c = 1\n\nThe finite-N density for the WL ensembles R(\u03bb; \u03be) is well known in terms of Laguerre polynomials,\nsee eq. (B.7) for \u03b2 = 2 in the appendix B. This results into an explicit integral representation for the\nspectral density of our generalised ensembles, see eq. (B.10). Despite this result, it is rather difficult\nto extract information about the macroscopic large-N limit from those analytical formulae, both for\nthe standard and generalised WL ensembles.\nHence, we follow here an alternative route, already exploited in [27, 28, 29]: we directly insert the\nlarge-N result into eq. (2.11). The N \u226b 1 asymptotic of the WL density is known and given by the\nMar\u010denko-Pastur law, which is in fact the semi-circle law in squared variables at c = 1\nr\nn 2N\n\u2212 1 , with \u03bb \u2208 (0, 2N/n] .\n(3.2)\nlim R(\u03bb) =\nN \u226b1\n\u03c0 n\u03bb\nIt is given here for the Gaussian weight exp[\u2212n\u03b2\u03bb] for all three \u03b2, and can be derived easily using\nthe Coulomb gas approach and saddle point method (see also [15]).\nIn order to obtain an N -independent macroscopic density we have to rescale the argument of the\ndensity by the mean eigenvalue position, \u03bb \u2192 h\u03bbix, and divide by N to normalise the density to unity.\nThe mean position of an eigenvalue or first moment, h\u03bbi\u03b3 , can be computed in the generalised model\nfor both finite-N and finite-\u03bd (see appendix A),\nR\u221e\nd\u03bb \u03bb R\u03b3 (\u03bb)\n1\nh\u03bbi\u03b3 \u2261 R0 \u221e\nhTr(X\u2020 X)i\u03b3\n=\nN\n0 d\u03bb R\u03b3 (\u03bb)\n\u03b3(N + \u03bd)\n.\n(3.3)\n=\n2n(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b22 N (N + \u03bd) \u2212 1)\nWe will comment on the existence of this first moment later, and we will also need this equation again\nwhen we consider c < 1. It correctly reproduces the known result for WL in the limit lim\u03b3\u2192\u221e h\u03bbi\u03b3 =\nh\u03bbi = (N + \u03bd)/2n. For the WL case we thus obtain the following known N - and \u03b2-independent\nmacroscopic density from eq. (3.2)\nr\n1\n1\n4\n\u03c1(x) \u2261 lim\nh\u03bbiR(xh\u03bbi) =\n\u2212 1 , with x \u2208 (0, 4] .\n(3.4)\nN \u2192\u221e N\n2\u03c0 x\nIt is normalised to unity and has mean hxi = 1.\nWe can now repeat the same steps for our generalised model, where we will need eq. (3.2) for the\nweight exp[\u2212\u03ben\u03b2\u03bb/\u03b3] (see eq. (2.7)). Because of the rescaling with respect to h\u03bbi\u03b3 we now have to\nspecify the N -dependence of \u03b3. We keep the following combination fixed,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b2\n\u03b1 \u2261 lim \u03b3 \u2212 N (N + \u03bd) \u2212 1 ,\n(3.5)\nN,\u03b3\u2192\u221e\n2\nwith \u03b1 > 0 finite. This satisfies the constraint (2.2). We thus obtain for the generalised macroscopic\ndensity\n1\nh\u03bbi\u03b3 R\u03b3 (xh\u03bbi\u03b3 )\nN, \u03b3\u2192\u221e N\ns\nZ\n2N \u03b3\n1\n\u2212\u03be \u03b3\u22121 Z(\u03be) n\u03be\nd\u03be e \u03be\nh\u03bbi\u03b3\n\u22121 ,\n=\nlim\nN, \u03b3\u2192\u221e N\n\u0393(\u03b3)Z\u03b3 \u03b3\u03c0\nn\u03bexh\u03bbi\u03b3\nI\n\n\u03c1\u03b1 (x) \u2261\n\nlim\n\n7\n\n(3.6)\n\n\f2N \u03b3\nwhere the integration is restricted to the interval I = (0, nxh\u03bbi\n] = (0, 4\u03b1/x].

(3.8) is the main result of this subsection, the macroscopic spectral density of our generalised\nWL. It has an unbounded support (0, \u221e), and the density as well as its first moment are normalised\nto unity\nZ\nZ\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\ndx x \u03c1\u03b1 (x) .\n\ndx\u03c1\u03b1 (x) = 1 =\n\n(3.10)\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNote that due to this normalisation, the parameter n has completely dropped out. We are left with\na one-parameter class of densities depicted in fig. 1, which approach the WL density for \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e as\ndiscussed below.\nFrom the expansion for small arguments 1 F1 (a; b; z) = 1 + ab z + . . . we can immediately read off\nthe power law decay of our new density eq. (3.8)\n\u0393(\u03b1 + 23 )\nlim \u03c1\u03b1 (x) = x\u2212(\u03b1+2) \u221a\n(4\u03b1)\u03b1+1 (1 + O(1/x)) .\nx\u2192\u221e\n\u03c0\u0393(\u03b1 + 1)\u0393(\u03b1 + 3)\n\n(3.11)\n\nBecause of \u03b1 > 0 the decay is always faster than quadratic. However, if we drop the requirement for\nthe existence of the first moment we can allow for \u03b1 to take values \u22121 < \u03b1 < 0 while satisfying the\nconstraint eq. (2.2). Keeping the same formal rescaling in eq. (3.6) we arrive at the same result eq.\n(3.8) now valid for \u22121 < \u03b1 and \u03b1 6= 0 1 . Our density can thus describe power laws in between linear\nand quadratic decay as well, see fig. 1. The same feature could be incorporated in the generalised\nGaussian Wigner-Dyson model [27, 29, 28].\nAs a check we can take the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e on our final result eq. (3.8). This amounts to decoupling\nthe \u03b3- and N -dependence, and thus we expect to recover the MP density at \u03b3 = \u221e. By taking a\nsaddle point approximation, we find that this is indeed the case, lim\u03b1\u2192\u221e \u03c1\u03b1 (x) = \u03c1(x). Hence, the\ndensity \u03c1\u03b1 (x) is a well-behaved deformation of the MP density for c = 1.\nWe can also derive the behaviour of the density \u03c1\u03b1 (x) close to the origin. Using the large argument\nasymptotic for the confluent hypergeometric function at negative argument, limz\u2192\u221e 1 F1 (a; b; \u2212z) =\nz \u2212a \u0393(b)/\u0393(b \u2212 a)(1 + O(1/z)), we find that\n1\n\nlim \u03c1\u03b1 (x) = x\u2212 2\n\nx\u21920\n1\n\n\u0393(\u03b1 + 23 )\n\u221a (1 + O(x)) .\n\u03c0\u0393(\u03b1 + 1) \u03b1\n\nWe use the obvious notation \u03b1\u03b1+1 = exp[(\u03b1 + 1) ln |\u03b1|].\n\n8\n\n(3.12)\n\n\fTherefore all our generalised densities have a square root singularity at the origin, just as the MP\ndensity.\nTo illustrate our findings we first plot eq. (3.8) in Fig. 1 (left) for different values of \u03b1, and\ncompare it to the semi-circle density eq. (3.4). In order to visualise the square root singularity for all\n\u03b1 we map the density from the positive to the full real axis by defining\n\u03b8\u03b1 (y) \u2261 |y|\u03c1\u03b1 (y 2 ) ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nR\u221e\nthat is to a normalised density on R, \u2212\u221e dy\u03b8\u03b1 (y) = 1. In this form it equals the deformed semi-circle\nlaw derived from generalising the Gaussian Wigner-Dyson ensembles in [27, 29, 28], where we have\neliminated all irrelevant parameters.\nThe same map eq. (3.13) takes the MP density eq. (3.4) to the semi-circle, as mentioned already\nseveral times,\n1 p\n4 \u2212 y2 .\n(3.14)\n\u03b8(y) =\n2\u03c0\nBoth densities are shown in Fig. 1 (right). For \u03b1 = 14 it already approximates the semi-circle very\nwell, whereas for \u03b1 \u2192 0 the generalised density rapidly approximates a \u03b4-function. For negative\n\u22121 < \u03b1 < 0 the height of the maximum in fig. 1 left goes down again, for \u03b1 = \u22120.5 the curve is even\nbelow the semi-circle.\n\u03c1\u03b1 (x)\n\n1\n\n\u03b8\u03b1 (y)\n\n1\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nx\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\ny\n\nFigure 1: The macroscopic generalised density eq.

Note that the MP or semi-circle density given in black\nfor comparison has compact support on (0, 4] and [\u22122, 2] respectively.\nAs a final point of this subsection let us discuss the issue of macroscopic universality of our\ngeneralised density, eq. (3.8). This is a direct consequence of the (non-)universality of the MP or semi\ncircular density, due to the linear relationship eq. (2.11).\nThe semi-circle possesses a certain weak universality in the sense that it is the same for all three\nGaussian ensembles at \u03b2 = 1, 2, 4, as well as for independently distributed random variables, as was\nshown already by Wigner. Consequently our generalised density is universal in this weak sense, too.\nOn the other hand the invariant deformation of the Gaussian potential by a polynomial in the\ndefinition of our model is clearly non-universal, as the semi-circle becomes a polynomial times one or\nseveral square root cuts, and we refer to [6] for details at \u03b2 = 2. Remarkably, it was found in [6] for\n\u03b2 = 2 that all macroscopic two- or higher k-point connected density correlation functions are universal\nunder such perturbations V , depending only on a finite number of parameters for any degree d. Does\n9\n\n\fthis universality persist in our model? The answer is no, simply by looking at the definition of the\nconnected two-point density:\nR\u03b3conn (\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2261 R\u03b3 (\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2212 R\u03b3 (\u03bb)R\u03b3 (\u03bc) .\n\n(3.15)\n\nWe use the same definition for the standard WL density. It no longer relates linearly to the corresponding connected WL two-point density as we would subtract an integral of the product of two\n1-point densities, instead of the product of two integrated 1-point densities:\nZ \u221e\nZ(\u03be)\nconn\nR(\u03bb, \u03bc; \u03be)\nd\u03be e\u2212\u03be \u03be \u03b3\u22121\nR\u03b3 (\u03bb, \u03bc) =\n\u0393(\u03b3)Z\u03b3\n0\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nZ(\u03be)\n\u2212\u03be \u03b3\u22121 Z(\u03be)\nd\u03be e \u03be\n\u2212\nd\u03be e\u2212\u03be \u03be \u03b3\u22121\nR(\u03bb; \u03be)\nR(\u03bc; \u03be)\n\u0393(\u03b3)Z\u03b3\n\u0393(\u03b3)Z\u03b3\n0\n0\nZ \u221e\nZ(\u03be)\nd\u03be e\u2212\u03be \u03be \u03b3\u22121\n6=\nRconn (\u03bb, \u03bc; \u03be) .\n(3.16)\n\u0393(\u03b3)Z\n\u03b3\n0\n\nThe universal macroscopic connected two-point function obtained in the large-N limit \u03c1conn (x, y; \u03be) in\n[6] will thus mix with the non-universal density \u03c1(x; \u03be), and the same feature persists for higher k-point\nconnected correlators. This should not come as a surprise as the same situation was encountered in the\nfixed or restricted trace ensembles [32, 33], being an integral transformation of the classical WignerDyson ensembles. As observed there [33] our microscopic correlations will remain universal, see sect.4.\nN\n\u2192 c < 1. The corresponding standard WL ensemble\nIn the next section we will study the limit M\ncan be mapped to the so-called generalised Penner model [7] with positive definite matrices. The extra\ndeterminant from the Jacobian of this change of variables can be written as an extra logarithm in the\npotential V \u2192 V + N ln |\u03bb|. For the same reason as given above the universal findings made in [7] for\nthe unitary ensemble \u03b2 = 2 do not translate to the macroscopic limit in the next section either.\n\n3.2\n\nGeneralised Mar\u010denko-Pastur law for c < 1\n\nIn this subsection we deal with the limit in which the matrix X remains rectangular, that is both M\nand N = cM become large such that limN,M \u2192\u221e N/M = c < 1. This limit is particularly relevant for\napplications to real data series.\nWe will follow the same steps as in the previous subsection. It is known that in the standard WL\nensembles with weight exp[\u2212n\u03b2\u03bb] the corresponding density is given by the following MP law,\ns\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0015\nN\nN\nN\nN\nn\nX\u2212\nX+ \u2212 \u03bb , with \u03bb \u2208\nX\u2212 , X+ .\n\u03bb\u2212\n(3.17)\nlim R(\u03bb) =\nN \u226b1\n\u03c0\u03bb\n2n\n2n\n2n\n2n\nFor later convenience we have defined the bounds\n1\n\nX\u00b1 \u2261 (c\u2212 2 \u00b1 1)2 , with 0 < c < 1 .\n\n(3.18)\n\nIn the limit c \u2192 1 we recover from eq. (3.17) the semi-circle eq. (3.2) from the last section.\nThe N -independent density is again obtained after rescaling by the mean eigenvalue position\nh\u03bbi\u03b3 =\n\n\u03b3N\n2nc(\u03b3 \u2212\n\n\u03b2\n2\n2c N\n\n\u2212 1)\n\n,\n\n(3.19)\n\nN\n, which is the\nwhere we have used M = N + \u03bd = N/c. For large \u03b3 we obtain the quantity h\u03bbi = 2nc\naverage position for the standard WL in our limit c < 1. We thus obtain for the rescaled density MP\ndensity\n1\n1 p\n\u03c1(x) \u2261 lim\n(x \u2212 cX\u2212 )(cX+ \u2212 x) , with x \u2208 [cX\u2212 , cX+ ] .\n(3.20)\nh\u03bbiR(xh\u03bbi) =\nN \u2192\u221e N\n2\u03c0cx\n\n10\n\n\fIt is normalised to unity with mean hxi = 1.\nFor the generalised model we have to insert eq. (3.17), now with weight exp[\u2212\u03be n\u03b2\n\u03b3 \u03bb], into eq.\n(2.11) and rescale with respect to eq. (3.19).

This result was derived previously\n(modulo different notations) for \u03b2 = 1 in [25], using different methods. The integral in eq. (3.23)\ncan be computed in principle in terms of a confluent hypergeometric series in two variables (see [34],\nformulae 3.385 and 9.261(1)), but the integral form is more convenient for numerical evaluations and\nan asymptotic analysis. As a first check we recover eq. (3.8) in the limit c \u2192 1. Furthermore, one can\nshow that the following limit holds, lim\u03b1\u2192\u221e \u03c1\u03b1 (x) = \u03c1(x), recovering the MP density eq. (3.20). Thus\nthe large-N limit and the large-\u03b3 limit are again well behaved. We have also checked in appendix B\nthat the convergence with N towards the density eq. (3.8) is very fast, see fig. 9, in fact faster than\nfor WL. Our remark from the previous subsection allowing \u22121 < \u03b1 < 0 applies here too.\nIt is easy to see how the density decays for large x \u226b 1\nlim \u03c1\u03b1 (x) = x\u2212(\u03b1+2)\n\nx\u2192\u221e\n\n(c\u03b1)\u03b1+1\nC(1 + O(1/x)) ,\n2\u03c0\u0393(\u03b1 + 1)\n\nwith the same power law as for c = 1.

(3.20) has compact support between\n[cX\u2212 , cX+ ], our generalised density is non-vanishing on the entire real positive axis, even for c < 1.\nTo the left of the edge in MP, x < cX\u2212 , our density decreases but remains non-zero. Below a\ncertain point that we will call pseudo edge, X\u2212 , our density becomes exponentially suppressed. From\nthe asymptotic (3.26) it is possible to give an estimate for X\u2212 , below which the density becomes\nnegligible.

Our findings will be\nuniversal for a general non-Gaussian polynomial potential V (\u03bb) for all three \u03b2 = 1, 2, 4, inheriting the\ncorresponding universality from the standard ensembles.\nWe will only consider the case c = 1 and the so-called hard edge here, deriving a generalised\nBessel-law for the microscopic densities and their first eigenvalue distributions. For c < 1 the local\ndistribution at the inner (and outer) soft edge of the standard WL ensembles follows the Tracy\u2013\nWidom-law. Although it would be very interesting to derive the corresponding generalisation we have\nnot managed so far, and leave this task for future investigation.\nIn the first subsection the microscopic densities are derived while the second subsection is devoted\nto the first eigenvalue distributions. The matching of the two is illustrated in many pictures throughout\nthis section, being an important consistency check.\n\n12\n\n\f4.1\n\nGeneralised universal Bessel-law\n\nLet us first recall the definition of the microscopic limit in the standard WL ensembles, resulting into\nthe universal Bessel-law. We will discuss in detail the case \u03b2 = 2 and then only quote the results for\n\u03b2 = 1, 4.\nFor simplicity consider the Gaussian case first. Starting from the weight exp[\u2212n\u03b2\u03bb] we first scale\nout the mean eigenvalue \u03bb \u2192 xh\u03bbi, just as in eq. (3.4) for the macroscopic limit. On top of that we\nmake a further rescaling by the mean level spacing 4N 2 x = y, keeping y fixed. We therefore define\nthe microscopic limit as\n\u0010 y\n\u0011\n1\nh\u03bbiR\nh\u03bbi\n,\n(4.1)\n\u03c1\u03bd(\u03b2) (y) \u2261 lim\nN \u2192\u221e 2N 2\n4N 2\nwhere R(\u03bb) is the spectral density for finite-N in one of the three WL ensembles. The result now\ndepends on \u03b2 and \u03bd as indicated through the indices, in contrast to the semi-circle law. We can then\napply the following asymptotic\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0010 z \u0011\u2212\u03bd\nz\n\u2212\u03bd \u03bd\nJ\u03bd (z)\n(4.2)\n=\nlim k Lk\nk\u2192\u221e\n4k\n2\nto the orthogonal Laguerre polynomials in the finite-N density, see eq.

The Bessel density is plotted for different\nvalues of \u03bd in fig. 4 together with the first eigenvalue from the next subsection, after changing to the\nconventional squared variables y \u2192 y 2 (see eq. (3.13)),\n\u03b8(2)\n\u03bd (y) =\n\n|y|\n(J\u03bd (y)2 \u2212 J\u03bd\u22121 (y)J\u03bd+1 (y)) .\n2\n\n(4.4)\n\nThis result is universal [19] being valid for any potential V with spectral support including the origin.\nWe only have to rescale in eq. (4.1) by the macroscopic density in terms of the squared variables \u03c0\u03b8(0)\nfor a general potential V , instead of the Gaussian macroscopic density eq. (3.14) where \u03c0\u03b8(0) = 1. In\nother words all orthogonal polynomials eq. (2.13) tend to Bessel-J functions in the microscopic limit.\nWe can now repeat the above analysis for our generalised microscopic density. The scaling of \u03b3\nwith N keeping \u03b1 fixed is kept throughout this entire section. In the previous section we found that\nthe density diverges exactly like the standard density as an inverse square root, see eq. (3.12). For that\nreason the microscopic rescaling is the same, without changing powers of N . However, the constant\nin front of the macroscopic density at the origin is not the standard Gaussian result, 1/\u03c0 = \u03b8(0), but\ngiven by eq. (3.12), \u03b8\u03b1 (0) = b/\u03c0 with\nb \u2261\n\n\u0393(\u03b1 + 32 )\n\u221a .\n\u0393(\u03b1 + 1) \u03b1\n\n(4.5)\n\nWe therefore define the microscopic limit as\n(\u03b2)\n\u03c1\u03b1,\n\u03bd (y) \u2261\n2\n\n\u0010 y\n\u0011\n1\n.\nh\u03bbi\nR\nh\u03bbi\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nN,\u03b3\u2192\u221e 2N 2 b2\n4N 2 b2\nlim\n\n(4.6)\n\nInstead of eq.

(B.9), leading to the same result.\n\n13\n\n\fBecause of the universality we just stated we can restrict ourselves to do the computation for the\northogonal polynomials with Gaussian weight exp[\u22122n\u03be\u03bb/\u03b3] in eq.

The integral\ncould be expressed in terms of generalised hypergeometric functions, but for plots this representation\nis preferable. Note that in our the calculation we have inserted the ratio of partition functions eq.\n(3.7) for the Gaussian models. This quantity is again universal as in the large-N limit not only the\npolynomials themselves, but also their norms become universal. Starting from eq. (2.18) the standard\nWL partition functions is given as follows\nlim (log[Z(\u03be)] \u2212\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nlog[N ! hN\n0 ])\n\n=\n\nlim N\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nN\n\u22121 \u0012\nX\ni=0\n\ni\n1\u2212\nN\n\n\u0013\n\nlog[ri ] =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\ndt(1 \u2212 t) log[r(t)]\n\n(4.8)\n\nThe \u03be-dependent ratios of the norms determined by the so-called string or recursion equation at finiteN have a universal limit r(t) [19]. Re-exponentiating and inserting this universal result eq. (4.8) into\neq. (2.8), the generalised partition function Z\u03b3 also becomes universal in the large-N limit, and thus\nthe ratio eq.

(4.4) is shown in figs. 3 and\n4 for various values of \u03b1 and \u03bd. The plots include the corresponding first eigenvalues to be derived\nlater. As a check we can take the limit \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e to analytically reobtain eq. (4.4) from eq. (4.7). This\nis illustrated in fig. 3 where we observe that the convergence is rather slow. We have checked that for\n\u03b1 \u223c O(150) the first three maxima become indistinguishable.\nThe procedure for \u03b2 = 1 and 4 is the same as above and so we can be more concise. The\ncorresponding microscopic densities of the WL ensembles are again universal [20]. Computed initially\nin [17, 18] the obtained expressions can be simplified. They can be expressed through the \u03b2 = 2\ndensity eq.

A similar feature was observed in a generalisation\nof the unitary WL ensemble for critical statistics [31]. However, no power law tails seem to be present\nin such a model where only the generalised microscopic density and number variance were computed.\nIt is known that for standard WL the maxima of the Bessel density correspond to the location of\nindividual eigenvalues [37], as we will see in the next subsection. On the other hand the microscopic\ndensity of the WL ensembles in the bulk is completely flat, equalling \u03c01 in our normalisation. We may\nthus suspect that in the generalised model the bulk is approached much faster than in the standard\nWL, where localised maxima persist to y \u226b 10. We therefore focus mainly on the first eigenvalue\ndistribution in the generalised model which is the subject of the next subsection.\n15\n\n\f4.2\n\nGeneralised universal first eigenvalue distribution at the hard edge\n\nThe probability that the interval (0, s] is empty of eigenvalues is defined as follows,\nZ \u221e\n1\nE\u03b3 (s) \u2261\nd\u03bb1 * * * d\u03bbN P\u03b3 (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbN )\nZ\u03b3\nZ \u221es\nZ(\u03be)\nd\u03be e\u2212\u03be \u03be \u03b3\u22121\n=\nE(s; \u03be) ,\n\u0393(\u03b3)Z\u03b3\n0\nwhere the gap probability of the WL ensembles is defined as\nZ \u221e\n1\nE(s; \u03be) \u2261\nd\u03bb1 * * * d\u03bbN P(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbN ; \u03be) .\nZ(\u03be) s\n\n(4.14)\n(4.15)\n\n(4.16)\n\nBoth quantities are normalised to unity at s = 0 and vanish at s = \u221e. The distribution of the first\neigenvalue p(s) simply follows by differentiation.\np\u03b3 (s) \u2261 \u2212\n\n\u2202\nE\u03b3 (s) ,\n\u2202s\n\n(4.17)\n\nand likewise for WL. In WL the gap probability E(s) and the first eigenvalue distribution p(s) are\nexplicitly known and universal in the microscopic large-N limit for all \u03bd at \u03b2 = 2, for odd values of\n\u03bd and 0 at \u03b2 = 1, and for \u03bd = 0 at \u03b2 = 4. This has been shown by various authors independently\n[16, 38, 39, 37]. In some cases only finite-N results are know in terms of a hypergeometric function of\na matrix valued argument [40, 41], from which limits are difficult to extract.\nAlthough p(s) follows from E(s), the most compact universal formulas are known directly for p(s)\nfor all three \u03b2 [37]. There, also the second and higher eigenvalue distributions are given, which we\nwill not consider here.\nFor pedagogical reasons we start once more with an explicit calculation for \u03b2 = 2 and the Gaussian\nensemble. At \u03bd = 0 the pre-exponential factor is absent and we have for WL with weight exp[\u22122n\u03bb]\n# N\n\"\nZ\nN\nY\nX\n1 \u221e\n|\u03bbj \u2212 \u03bbk |2 = exp[\u22122nN s] ,\n(4.18)\n\u03bbi\nd\u03bb1 * * * d\u03bbN exp \u22122n\nE(s) =\nZ s\ni=1\n\nj>k\n\nshifting all integration variables by s and using the invariance of the Vandermonde determinant. This\nresult is exact for any N and identical to the properly rescaled large-N result when keeping N s fixed.\nThe generalised ensemble follows easily, by inserting this result into eq. (4.15)\n2\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\n2n\u03beN s\n2nN s \u2212(\u03b3\u2212N )\nZ(\u03be)\n,\n(4.19)\nexp \u2212\n= 1+\nd\u03be e\u2212\u03be \u03be \u03b3\u22121\nE\u03b3 (s) =\n\u0393(\u03b3)Z\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n0\nwhich is also exact for finite and infinite N . This very fact implies that we have full control of the\nlarge-N limit. Because of the fat tails in our distributions it was not a priori clear if the scales at\nthe hard edge and in the bulk would mix. This implicit assumption of a separation of scales in the\nprevious subsection is thus fully justified.\nThe microscopic limit can be taken following eq. (4.1) for WL:\n\u0011\n\u0010 y\nh\u03bbi\n,\n(4.20)\nE\u03bd(\u03b2) (y) \u2261 lim E\nN \u2192\u221e\n4N 2\n\nwhere we explicitly indicate the dependence on \u03b2 and \u03bd, as in the previous subsection.

Eqs. (4.23) and (4.24) are compared to the corresponding densities eqs. (4.4) and (4.7) in fig.\n3 for various values of \u03b1.\nNext we give the first eigenvalue distribution for general \u03bd.

For the WL case the corresponding expression can be computed from the jpdf, where we\nintroduce \u03bd\u0304 \u2261 \u03b22 (\u03bd + 1) \u2212 1:\nP (\u03b2) (s) = Cs\u03b2+\u03bd\u0304+1/2 K1/2+\u03bd\u0304 (n\u03b2s)\n(5.2)\nwhere K\u03bc (x) is a modified Bessel function and the constant C is given by:\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0013\u22121\n\u03b2\n(5.3)\n\u0393 1 + \u03bd\u0304 +\nC= 2\n(n\u03b2)\n\u0393\n2\np\nOnly for \u03bd\u0304 = 0, one recovers the WL Wigner's surmise, using K1/2 (x) = \u03c0/2x e\u2212x (apart from\nsquared variables in the exponent there).

The green curves have value \u03b3 = 12, 12, 25 from left to right, and\ncorrectly approach the limiting WL curve.\n\n6\n\nConclusions and outlook\n\nWe have introduced a generalisation of all three ensembles of random matrices called Wishart-Laguerre\nor chiral ensembles, replacing the exponential of a non-Gaussian potential by a fat-tailed distribution\nwith parameter \u03b3. In the limit \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e we can recover the exponential weight and thus the standard\nensembles. This modification lead to the appearance of correlations with a power-law, governed by\na single parameter. Such a behaviour is found in many systems in nature, e.g. in the wide area of\ncomplex networks. WL ensembles are often used in comparing to eigenvalues from covariance matrices\nof real data sets. To illustrate the potential of our generalisation we show a comparison to financial\ndata in fig. 8. The eigenvalues of the covariance matrix from time series of stock data clearly show a\npower-law behaviour. These are well described by the generalised Mar\u010denko-Pastur density, refining\nprevious comparisons to the standard Mar\u010denko-Pastur law.\nThe solution of our generalised models relied heavily on the possibility of writing them as an\nintegral transform of the standard WL ensembles. This generalisation is thus in the spirit of superstatistics where other models have been constructed already. The virtue of our model is its invariance\nfor all three symmetry classes, allowing to go to an eigenvalues basis and to study universality. We\ncould show that the generalised macroscopic density which was known in the Gaussian case is only\nweakly universal.\nIn contrast all microscopic densities are universal under any invariant deformations by polynomial\npotentials. This macroscopic/microscopic dichotomy should not come as a surprise, being observed\npreviously for the restricted trace ensembles.\nWe exploited the linear relation to standard WL to solve our model exactly at finite-N for any\npolynomial potential, using the formalism of orthogonal polynomials therein. In the subsequent largeN double scaling limit, where \u03b3 is scaled with N , we derived all density correlations in the macroscopic\nlimit for quadratic and rectangular matrices, and in the microscopic limit at the hard edge for all\n21\n\n4\n\n\fthree values of \u03b2. Here we have mainly focused on the spectral density itself and the first eigenvalue\ndistribution. The general formalism for higher density or higher individual eigenvalue correlation\nfunctions was provided and is straightforward to use if such quantities will be needed.\nWhile the hard edge was solved exhaustively, persisting in our model for asymptotically quadratic\nmatrices, we only provided a Wigner surmise in the bulk. Here, more detailed properties of correlation\nfunctions could be investigated, including a possible generalisation of the Tracy-Widom distribution\nat the soft edges. This is left for future investigations.\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n\u03c1(\u03bb;c)\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n\u03bb/\u3008\u03bb\u3009\n\nFigure 8: Comparison between the rescaled eigenvalue distribution from financial data [42] and the\nmacroscopic density \u03c1\u03b1 (x) for the generalised model eq.

First, we derive the condition under which our generalised\nmodel defined in eq. (2.1) is convergent. Second, we compute both the generalised and standard\nGaussian partition functions in order to determine their \u03be-dependent ratio needed in the computation\nof all eigenvalue correlation functions. Third, we compute the first moment as a function of N , \u03bd, \u03b2\nand \u03b3 which is needed for the rescaling of the eigenvalues in the large-N limit.\nAll three steps will be performed by changing variables from independent matrix elements or its\neigenvalues to radial coordinates, following [32].\n22\n\n\fThe generalised partition function reads in terms of eigenvalues\nZ\u03b3 =\n\nZ\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nN\n\u221eY\n\nd\u03bbi\n\ni=1\n\n\u03a9(N )\n\ndaN\n\nN\nY\n\n1\n\n\u03bbi2\n\n\u03b2(\u03bd+1)\u22121\n\ni=1\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndrr N \u22121 r\n\nN\nY\n\n|\u03bbj \u2212 \u03bbk |\u03b2 \u0010\n1+\nj>k\n\nN ( 21 \u03b2(\u03bd+1)\u22121)\n\n0\n\nn\u03b2\n\u03b3\n1\n\n1\nPN\n\n\u0011\u03b3\nV\n(\u03bb\n)\ni\ni=1\n\n\u0013\nN \u0012\nY\n\u03bbi 2 \u03b2(\u03bd+1)\u22121\nr\n\ni=1\n\nr\n\nN(N\u22121)\n\u03b2\n2\n\n(A.1)\nQN\n\nj>k\n\n\u0010\n1+\n\nn\u03b2\n\u03b3\n\n\u03bbj\nr\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03bbk\nr\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u0011\u03b3 .\n\u03bbi\nV\n(r\n)\ni=1\nr\n\nPN\n\nHere we have changed to radial coordinates of the N -component vector of the eigenvalues (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbN ),\nand daN denotes the angular integration over the N -dimensional unit sphere \u03a9(N ). The eigenvectors\nei = \u03bbi /r of norm unity span \u03a9(N ) and no longer depend on the radius. Collecting all powers of r in\nthe numerator and comparing to the leading power of the denominator d\u03b3 at large r \u226b 1, the integral\nonly converges if the following inequality holds:\n\u03b2\nN (N + \u03bd) \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b3d < \u22121 ,\n2\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhich is exactly eq.

(3.3) and normalise to 1: \u03c1\u0302\u03b3 (x) \u2261 N \u22121 h\u03bbi\u03b3 R\u03b3 (h\u03bbi\u03b3 x).\n2. Next, we express \u03b3 as a function of \u03b1 and N , \u03b3 = \u03b1 + N (N + \u03bd) + 1, and pass to squared\nvariables: \u03b8\u0302\u03b1 (x) \u2261 |x|\u03c1\u0302\u03b3 (x2 ).\n3. Then, we compare \u03b8\u0302\u03b1 (x) and \u03b8\u03b1 (x) for \u03bd = 0 in Fig. 9. The agreement is already very good for\nN = 4, apart from the region close to the origin.\n\u03b8\u0302\u03b1 (y)\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 y\n\nFigure 9: The macroscopic generalised semi-circle density \u03b8\u03b1 (x) eq.
