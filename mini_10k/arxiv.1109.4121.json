An overview of the varying motivations for this problem may be found\nin [11]. In the case of Gaussian matrices, many exact formulas are available both at finite\ndimension and asymptotically [4, 13]. Only quite recently has it been shown that the asymptotic laws are universal beyond the Gaussian case (in the sense of being insensitive to the\nstatistics of the matrix entries), see [12].\nHere we consider the \"general beta\" analogues of the classical Gaussian ensembles. These\nare defined by placing a measure on n nonnegative real points \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbn with density\nfunction (a normalization constant times)\nY\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\n|\u03bbi \u2212 \u03bbj |\n\n\u03b2\n\nn\nY\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03bbi2\n\n(a+1)\u22121 \u2212 \u03b2 \u03bbi\n2\n\ne\n\n.\n\n(1.1)\n\ni=1\n\n\u2217\n\nDepartment of Mathematics, Universidad de Costa Rica. e-mail: alexander.ramirez g@ucr.ac.cr.\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of Colorado Boulder. e-mail: brian.rider@colorado.edu.\n\u2021\nDepartment of Mathematics, University Minnesota; Department of Mathematics, Weizmann Institute.\ne-mail: zeitouni@math.umn.edu.\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fWhen \u03b2 = 1, 2, 4 and a = 0, 1, 2, . . . this is the joint square-singular value law of an n\u00d7(n+a)\nreal, complex, or quaternion Gaussian matrix. It is however a sensible law for any \u03b2 > 0\nand a > \u22121, and, what is more, still a joint square-singular value law for a certain random\nbi-diagonal matrix ensemble [3]. Further, the least order statistic \u03bbmin satisfies a limit law:\nas n \u2191 \u221e, n2 \u03bbmin converges (in distribution) to a well defined random variable, denoted here\nby \u039b (= \u039b(\u03b2, a)). There are several proofs of this for special values of \u03b2 and a; [10] contains\na proof (making use of the bi-diagonal representation of [3] and substantiating a conjecture\nof [5]) valid for all values of those parameters.\nOur starting point is a relation between the law of \u039b and the explosion/non-explosion of\nthe diffusion process: with b a Brownian motion,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b2 \u221a \u2212\u03b2t/8\n\u03b2\n(a + ) \u2212\n\u03bbe\ncosh x(t) dt.\n(1.2)\ndx(t) = db(t) +\n4\n2\n2\nIn particular, a corrected version of Theorem 2 of [10] (see also the derivation leading to\n(2.3) below) implies that\nP (\u039b > \u03bb) = P\u221e,0 (t 7\u2192 x(t) never hits \u2212 \u221e).\n\n(1.3)\n\nHere Pc,s indicates the law on paths induced by x, begun from position c at time s. Our\nmain result reads:\nTheorem 1. Let p\u03bb = p\u03bb,\u03b2,a denote the right hand side of (1.3). For large values of \u03bb it\nholds\n\u221a\n\u03b3(\u03b3+1\u2212\u03b2/2)\n\u03b2\ne(\u03b2, a)(1 + o(1)).\n(1.4)\np\u03bb = e\u2212 2 \u03bb+2\u03b3 \u03bb \u03bb\u2212 2\u03b2\nHere \u03b3 = \u03b22 (a + 1) \u2212 1 and e(\u03b2, a) > 0 is an undetermined constant.\nThere has already been a great deal of work in this direction, though focussed on dealing\ndirectly with the statistics (1.1) rather than our passage time description (1.3). The fundamental treatment of Tracy-Widom [13] for \u03b2 = 2 produced the correct \u03bb \u2192 \u221e asymptotics\nof p\u03bb,2,a up to a multiplicative constant and provided a conjecture for that constant, e(2, a).\nThis has recently been verified by Ehrhardt [7], for |a| < 1, by operator theoretic techniques,\nand for all a > \u22121 by Deift-Krasovsky-Vasilevska [2] using Riemann Hilbert Problem machinery. A non-rigorous argument in [1] predicted all factors in the asymptotics save the\nconstant for all (\u03b2, a). Making use of integral identities available at special values of \u03b2 and\ninteger a, Forrester has a sound conjecture for the value of the general constant e(\u03b2, a), see\n[6]. It appears possible that a type of analytic continuation argument could extend the result\nof [6] to all \u03b2 (though for still integer a). The method employed here leaves e(\u03b2, a) in opaque\nform, as a somewhat involved expectation over diffusion paths; an explicit determination of\nthis object for all \u03b2 and a remains an open problem.\n2\n\n\fIn many ways, the chief insight of this paper is to cast the diffusion (1.2), which encodes\nthe desired probability distribution, in the present form. (The process which appears in\n[10] is related by a change of variables.) In fact, t 7\u2192 x(t) is remarkably similar to the\nprocess studied by Valk\u00f3-Vir\u00e1g in estimating the probability of large gaps in the general\nbeta \"bulk\" [14]. They showed that the probability of a gap being larger than \u03bb is equal to\nthe non-explosion, again to \u2212\u221e, of\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b2 \u2212\u03b2t/4\ndz(t) = db(t) +\ntanh z(t) \u2212 \u03bbe\ncosh z(t) dt,\n2\n8\nbegun again at +\u221e. It is no surprise then that their basic argument, which involves estimating the Cameron-Martin-Girsanov factor produced by a well-chosen change of measure,\nmay be followed in this case.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 occupies sections 3 and 4; section 2 gives a self-contained explanation of the identity (1.3).\n\n2\n\nPassage time description for \u039b\n\nWithout pointing the reader to [10] and the subsequent erratum, it is easy enough to give a\nbrief derivation of the relevance of the diffusion (1.2) to the distribution function P (\u039b > \u03bb).\nThe main result of [10] shows that \u039b\u22121 is the maximal eigenvalue of the almost surely trace\nclass integral operator\n\u0013\nZ \u221e \u0012Z t\u2227s\n\u2212(a+1)s\u2212 \u221a2\u03b2 b(s)\nau+ \u221a2\u03b2 b(u)\nds,\n(2.1)\ndu \u03c8(s)e\nL\u03b2,a \u03c8(t) :=\ne\n0\n\n0\n\n\u2212(a+1)t\u2212 \u221a2\u03b2 b(t)\n\nacting on L2 [R+ , \u03bc], \u03bc(dt) = e\n\ndt. Here t 7\u2192 b(t) is a standard Brownian motion.\n\nAny nonnegative L2 solution of \u03c8(t) = \u03bbL\u03b2,a \u03c8(t) satisfies \u03c8(0) = 0 and \u03c8 \u2032 (t) :=\nd\u03c8(t)/dt \u2265 0 for all t > 0, as can be seen by taking derivatives of both sides of the eigenvalue\nequation:\nZ\n\u221e\n\nat+ \u221a2\u03b2 b(t)\n\n\u03c8 \u2032 (t) = \u03bbe\n\n\u2212(a+1)s\u2212 \u221a2\u03b2 b(s)\n\n\u03c8(s)e\n\nds.\n\nt\n\nThis converts to a differential system:\n2\n2\nd\u03c8 \u2032 (t) = \u221a \u03c8 \u2032 (t)db(t) + [(a + )\u03c8 \u2032 (t) \u2212 \u03bbe\u2212t \u03c8(t)]dt, d\u03c8(t) = \u03c8 \u2032 (t)dt\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich can be used to test whether a fixed \u03bb is at or below an eigenvalue. Specifically, \u03bb\nis strictly below the groundstate eigenvalue \u039b if the solution to (2.2) begun at \u03c8(0) = 0\n(and \u03c8 \u2032 (0) = 1 say) satisfies \u03c8(t) > 0, \u03c8 \u2032 (t) > 0 for all time (note that solutions of (2.2) are\n3\n\n\fdecreasing in \u03bb). It is now the standard trick to translate this condition onto the diffusion\nq(t) := \u03c8 \u2032 (t)/\u03c8(t) which solves\n2\n2\ndq(t) = \u221a q(t)db(t) + [(a + )q(t) \u2212 q 2 (t) \u2212 \u03bbe\u2212t ]dt,\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nstarted from +\u221e at time t = 0. In particular, if \u03c4c is the passage time of q to a level c, the\nevent {\u039b > \u03bb} coincides with {\u03c40 = \u221e}. Now the change of variables,\nx(t) := log(q(\u03b2t/4)) + \u03b2t/8 \u2212 log \u03bb/2,\n\n(2.3)\n\nexplains the identity (1.3).\nAs a bit of amplification, we remark that for q = q(*; a, \u03b2, \u03bb) with a \u2265 0,\nP(\u03c4\u2212\u221e (q) < \u221e|\u03c40 (q) < \u221e) = 1.\n\n(2.4)\n\nSo, at least for a \u2265 0, one can replace the condition of q never vanishing with the (more\nfamiliar) condition that q never explodes to \u2212\u221e. Furthermore, a change of variables similar\nto (2.3) shows that the event that q(*; a, \u03b2, \u03bb) started from 0 never hits \u2212\u221e is the same as\nthe event that q(*; \u2212a\u22121, \u03b2, \u03bb), started from +\u221e never hits 0. In particular, defining instead\nx(t) := \u2212 log(\u2212q(\u03b2t/4)) + \u03b2t/8 \u2212 log \u03bb/2 (keeping in mid that for all t > \u03c40 , q(t) < 0), x(t)\nwill solve (1.2) with a replaced by \u2212a \u2212 1. One concludes that\nlim P (\u039b > \u03bb) = lim P\u221e (\u03c40 (q(*; a, \u03b2, \u03bb)) = \u221e) = lim P0 (\u03c4\u2212\u221e (q(*; a, \u03b2, \u03bb)) = \u221e) = 0\n\na\u2193\u22121\n\na\u2193\u22121\n\na\u21910\n\nfor any \u03bb > 0 (by say monotone convergence), as would have been guessed ahead of time.\nTo prove (2.4), on the event {\u03c40 < \u221e} introduce the simpler change of variables u(t) =\nlog(\u2212q(t + \u03c40 )).

This completes the proof.\n\n3\n\nChange of measure\n\nHereafter it is convenient to put the time index in subscripts, i.e., x(t) becomes xt and the\nlike. To begin, introduce the notation\np\u03bb (c) = Pc (xt never explodes).\nThen, by the strong Markov property,\nh\ni\np\u03bb = p\u03bb (\u221e) = E\u221e p1 (xT ), xt > \u2212\u221e for t \u2208 (0, T ] ,\nupon choosing\nT =\n\n4\nlog \u03bb.\n\u03b2\n\n(3.1)\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe change of measure is now enacted on the expectation (3.1).\nProposition 2.

Moreover,\np\u03bb = E\u221e [p1 (yT ) RT (y* )],\n(3.3)\nin which, for s \u2264 T ,\nlog Rs (y. ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nf (t, y) = \u03b24 (a + 21 ) \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\u03b2\n2\n\ns\n\n1\n(f (t, yt ) \u2212 g(t, yt ))dyt \u2212\n2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\ns\n\n(f 2 (t, yt ) \u2212 g 2 (t, yt ))dt,\n\n\u03bb e\u2212\u03b2t/8 cosh y and g(t, y) = h(t, y) \u2212\n\n\u03b2\n2\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bb e\u2212\u03b2t/8 sinh y.\n\nThis is just the formula of Cameron-Martin-Girsanov, applied to the particular case of a\ndiffusion with explosion for which it is important to point out that the test function p1 (xT ) in\n5\n\n\fquestion vanishes when T is larger than the explosion time. One also notes that the general\nform of the y-drift, effectively a bounded function minus sinh y, allows yt to be started at\n+\u221e and prevents yt from exploding on [0, T ]. To then carry out the standard proof of\nCameron-Martin-Girsanov in the present context, it must be checked that Rt\u22121 (x), which is\na local martingale by construction, is actually a martingale. But again by the general form\nof the y-drift, both f \u2212 g and f 2 \u2212 g 2 are bounded when the path is bounded below, keeping\nRt\u22121 (x) bounded prior to the explosion time of xt . Plainly, Rt\u22121 (x) = 0 at and after the\nexplosion time.\nThe first ingredient of the proof of Theorem 1 is the following. Throughout the below,\n[x] denotes the negative part of x \u2208 R. Also recall that \u03b3 = \u03b22 (a + 1) \u2212 1.\n\u2212\n\nLemma 3.

The last term,\ncoupled with the fact that y0 = \u221e, prompts a natural shift of h by the factor \u03b24 (a + 21 ). That\nis, h is replaced with h + \u03b24 (a + 12 ).\nStep 2 enacts the above shift, and also introduces the obvious It\u00f4 substitution in the\nsecond last term of (3.7),\nZ T\nZ T\n\u03b2 \u2212yT\n\u03b2 \u03b22 \u221a\n\u03b2\u221a\n\u2212\u03b2t/8 \u2212yt\n\u03bb\ne\ne dyt = \u2212 e\ne\u2212\u03b2t/8 e\u2212yt dt\n+( \u2212 ) \u03bb\n2\n2\n4\n16\n0\n0\nto write:\nZ T\n\u03b22\nlog RT (y* ) = \u2212 \u03bb\ne\u2212\u03b2t/4 dt\n(3.8)\n8\n0\n\u0012 Z T\n\u0013\nZ T\n\u03b3\n\u03b2\u221a\n\u2212\u03b2t/8 \u2212yt\n\u2212\u03b2t/8\n\u03bb\n+\ne\ne dt \u2212\ne\nh(t, yt ) sinh(yt )dt\n2\n2 0\n0\nZ\nZ T\nZ T\n\u03b2\n1\n\u03b2\n1 T 2\nh (t, yt )dt + (a + )\nh(t, yt )dt \u2212\nh(t, yt )dyt + e\u2212yT .\n+\n2 0\n4\n2 0\n2\n0\n\u221a\nThis draws attention to line two of (3.8), which should produce the final constant times \u03bb\nterm.

Note that the boundary values of H2 will necessitate\nthat our choice of h2 , like that of h1 , is integrable at +\u221e (= y0 ).

In other words, with this choice the first term of (3.13) equals \u03b24 \u03ba log \u03bb, the\nadvertised log \u03bb contribution in Theorem 1.\nTo finish the proof of the lemma we further identify\n1\n\u03bd(T, y) = \u2212(\u03b2(a + ) + 2) + H1 (y) + H2 (T, y),\n2\n\n(3.14)\n\nand \u03c6(T \u2212 t, y) with the integrand of the last term in (3.13). One now checks: h1 and h2\nalong with their derivatives are uniformly bounded over the entire real line (with constants\n8\n\n\fdepending on a and \u03b2 of course), h1 is integrable at +\u221e, and h2 is in fact integrable at\nboth \u00b1\u221e.

This is again structurally\nidentical to [14].\nThe first observation is that the E\u221e integration is performed over paths that are monotonically decreasing in T .

That e is not equal to zero follows\nfrom\nZ 0\nT \u03c8(y T )\ne \u2265 lim inf E[p1 (y0 )e\n]\u2265\np\u2212 (z)m(dz) > 0.\nT \u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nHere we have used that z 7\u2192 p\u2212 (z) is decreasing in order to replace y T -paths with z-paths,\nalong with the fact that p1 (z) (and so too p\u2212 (z)) is strictly positive (Lemma 4). This\ncompletes the proof of Theorem 1, granted the below.\nProof of Lemma 4. The continuity follows from that of the transition density p(*, x, y) in\nboth space variables (the corresponding generator is hypo-elliptic).\nTo see that p1 (x) > 0, first note that the operator L\u03b2,a defined in (2.1) which encodes\nthe point process of eigenvalues is positive and compact. A proof that L\u03b2,a is in fact (almost\nsurely) trace class is contained in Lemma 6 of [10]. Its maximal eigenvalue, \u039b\u22121 , is therefore\nalmost surely bounded above, and so there exists a small enough \u03bb0 > 0 such that p\u03bb0 =\np\u03bb0 (\u221e) > 0. Next, by the Markov property,\nZ \u221e\np\u03bb0 (\u221e) =\np(t, \u221e, x)p\u03bb0 e\u2212\u03b2t/4 (x)dx,\n\u221e\n\nand it follows that for every t > 0 there is a x0 such that p\u03bb0 e\u2212\u03b2t/4 (x0 ) > 0. Applying the\nsame formula once again, we find that for any z \u2208 R\nZ \u221e\np1 (x) \u2265\np(s, x, y)pe\u2212\u03b2s/4 (y)dy \u2265 Px (xs \u2265 z)pe\u2212\u03b2s/4 (z).\nz\n\nTo finish, choose s = t \u2212\n\n4\n\u03b2\n\nlog \u03bb0 and then set z to be the appropriate x0 .\n\nFor the bound (4.5) we can restrict to x less than some large negative constant, and note\nthat p1 (x) is bounded by the probability of non explosion for the following process\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\na+\n\u2212 e\u2212\u03b2t/8 e\u2212\u1ef9t .\nd\u1ef9t = dbt +\n4\n2\n4\nsince the downward drift on \u1ef9 is weaker than that of x. Next make the change yt = \u1ef9t + \u03b2t\n8\nto obtain the homogenous process\n\u0001\n\u03b2\na + 1 \u2212 e\u2212yt ,\ndyt = dbt +\n4\nto which we can apply a version of Feller's test, similar to what was done at the end of\nSection 2. A scale function for the y-process is\nZ y\n\u0003\n\u03b2\u0002\ns(y) =\nexp{\u2212 (a + 1)\u03be + e\u2212\u03be \u2212 1 } d\u03be,\n2\n0\n11\n\n\fand the probability that this process exits through +\u221e is exactly the probability of not\nexploding. This follows by checking the conditions of now Proposition 5.22 of [9]. According\nto that same proposition, the exit probability equals\nZ\n\u0003\ns(x) \u2212 s(\u2212\u221e)\n1 x\n\u03b2\u0002\n=\nexp{\u2212 (a + 1)\u03be + e\u2212\u03be } d\u03be,\ns(+\u221e) \u2212 s(\u2212\u221e)\nZ \u2212\u221e\n2\nfrom which the required bound easily follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nAcknowledgements The second and third named authors were supported in part by NSF\ngrants DMS-0645756 and DMS-0804133, respectively.\n\nReferences\n[1] Chen, Y., Manning, S.M.
