The bright BL Lac object PKS 2005\u2013489 was\nobserved by BeppoSAX on November 1\u20132, 1998, following\nan active X\u2013ray state detected by RossiXTE.

Our X\u2013ray spectrum is the\nflattest ever observed for this source. The different X\u2013ray\nspectral slopes and fluxes, as measured by various satellites, are consistent with relatively little changes of the\npeak frequency of the synchrotron emission, always located below 1017 Hz. We discuss these results in the framework of synchrotron self\u2013Compton models. We found that\nfor the BeppoSAX observation, the synchrotron peak frequency is between 1015 and 2.5 \u00d7 1016 Hz, depending on\nthe model assumptions.\nKey words: BL Lacertae objects: general \u2013 X\u2013rays:\ngalaxies \u2013 BL Lacertae objects: individual: PKS 2005\u2013489\n\n1. Introduction\nThe overall spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars\n(BL Lac objects and violently variable quasars) shows (in\na \u03bd vs \u03bdF\u03bd representation) two broad emission peaks: the\nlower frequency peak is believed to be produced by synchrotron emission, while the higher frequency one is probably due to the inverse Compton process. The location\nof the synchrotron peak is used to define different classes\nof blazars: HBL (High frequency peaked blazar, with the\nmaximum power output in the UV or X\u2013ray frequencies)\nand LBL (Low frequency peaked blazar, peaking in the\nIR or optical bands) (Giommi & Padovani 1994). Thus,\nfor LBL sources the X\u2013ray emission is dominated by the\ninverse Compton component.\nSend offprint requests to: G. Tagliaferri\n\nThe continuum emission of blazars is both highly luminous and rapidly variable and it is probably dominated\nby emission from a jet moving relativistically at small angles to the line of sight (Blandford & Rees 1978). Strong\nevidence for bulk relativistic motion was first provided\nby multiwavelength studies, later confirmed directly with\nVLBI observations (Vermeulen & Cohen 1994). However,\nsingle epoch spectra cannot constrain the models of variability in relativistic jets (e.g. K\u00f6nigl 1989; Ulrich et al.\n1997). Since blazars emit over the entire electromagnetic\nspectrum, a key for understanding blazar variability is the\nacquisition of several wide band spectra in different luminosity states during major flaring episodes. Coupling spectral and temporal information greatly constrains the jet\nphysics, since different models predict different variability\nas a function of wavelength. Important progress in this respect has been achieved recently for some of the brightest\nand best studied blazars, as PKS 2155\u2013304 (Chiappetti et\nal. 1999; Urry et al. 1997), BL Lac (Bloom et al. 1997),\n3C 279 (Wehrle et al. 1998), Mkn 501 (Pian et al. 1998),\nMkn 421 (Maraschi et al. 1999; Fossati et al. 2000a,b),\nON 231 (Tagliaferri et al. 2000). We successfully used the\nBeppoSAX satellite (Boella et al. 1997a) to perform observations of blazars that were known to be in a high state\nfrom observations carried out both in other bands (mainly\noptical and TeV) and in the X\u2013ray band itself. The good\nBeppoSAX sensitivity and spectral resolution over a very\nwide X\u2013ray energy range are ideal to constrain the existing\nmodels for the X\u2013ray emission.\nPKS 2005\u2013489 (z = 0.071) is a bright BL Lac object that belongs to the 1 Jy radio catalog (Stickel et al.\n1991). Its broad band spectrum peaks in the UV\u2013 soft X\u2013\nray bands making it an HBL type of source. It is one of\nthe few extragalactic objects seen in the EUV band (Marshall et al. 1995) and it has been detected in the \u03b3\u2013ray\nband by EGRET (von Montigny et al. 1995). In the X\u2013ray\n\n\f2\n\nTagliaferri et al.: The 0.1\u2013200 keV spectrum of PKS 2005\u2013489\n\nFig. 1. The 2\u201310 keV light curve of PKS 2005\u2013489 during\nthe BeppoSAX observation of 1-2 November, 1998. The\nbin time is of 5400 s.\nband it has been observed 5 times with EXOSAT, showing\nlarge flux variations correlated with changes in the spectrum (harder spectrum with increasing flux) (Giommi et\nal. 1990, Sambruna et al. 1994a,b). These results are also\nconfirmed by two ROSAT observations, which also show\na steep 0.2-2.0 keV spectrum, with photon index of about\n3 (Sambruna et al. 1995). In September 1996, PKS 2005\u2013\n489 has been observed by BeppoSAX, that detected the\nsource in a rather bright state, with a flatter 2\u201310 keV\nphoton index of 2.3 (Padovani et al. 1988, 2000). Finally,\na monitoring campaign has been performed in the period\nOctober\u2013December 1998 with RossiXTE and the source\nhas been detected up to 40 keV (Perlman et al. 1999).\nDuring this campaign the source underwent a strong flare,\nwith a peak to quiescent 2-10 keV flux variation of a factor of 8 (30 with respect to the ROSAT fluxes). This event\nessentially lasted for all the RossiXTE campaign, peaking\non 10 November, thus the source was in a high state for at\nleast three months (Perlman et al. 1999). During the week\nof 18\u201325 October, a flare alert was issued by the all-sky\nmonitor (ASM) team (Remillard 1998). This triggered our\nToO observation and PKS 2005\u2013489 was observed with\nBeppoSAX in November 1\u20132, 1998.\nIn this paper we present and discuss the results of this\nBeppoSAX observation together with some simultaneous\ninfrared data.\n2. X\u2013ray Observations\n2.1. Observations and Data Reduction\nThe BeppoSAX satellite is an Italian mission with the participation of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programs (NIVR) and the Space Science Department of the\nEuropean Space Agency (SSD-ESA). It carries on board\n\nfour Narrow Field Instruments (NFI) pointing in the same\ndirection and covering a very large energy range from 0.1\nto 300 keV (Boella et al. 1997a). Two of the four instruments have imaging capability, the Low Energy Concentrator Spectrometer (LECS), sensitive in the range 0.1\u2013\n10 keV (Parmar et al. 1997), and the three Medium Energy Concentrator Spectrometers (MECS) sensitive in the\nrange 1.3\u201310 keV (Boella et al. 1997b). The LECS and\nthree MECS detectors are all Gas Scintillation Proportional Counters and are at the focus of four identical grazing incidence X\u2013ray telescopes. The other two are passively collimated instruments: the High Pressure Proportional Counter (HPGSPC), sensitive in the range 4\u2013120\nkeV (Manzo et al. 1997) and the Phoswich Detector System (PDS), sensitive in the range 13\u2013300 keV (Frontera et\nal. 1997). For a full description of the BeppoSAX mission\nsee Boella et al. (1997a).\nThe data analysis for the LECS and MECS instruments was based on the linearized, cleaned event files obtained from the online archive (Giommi & Fiore 1998).\nLight curves and spectra were accumulated with the\nFTOOLS package (v. 4.0), using an extraction region of\n8.5 and 4 arcmin radius for the LECS and MECS, respectively. At low energies the LECS has a broader Point\nSpread Function (PSF) than the MECS, while above 2 keV\nthe PSFs are similar. The adopted regions provide more\nthan 90% of the source counts at all energies both for the\nLECS and MECS.\nAs expected, PKS 2005\u2013489 was detected in a high\nstate in the X\u2013ray band. However, our observation occurred about one week before the source reached its maximum as monitored by RossiXTE (Perlman et al. 1999).\nSome flux variability of the order of 10% on a timescale\nof about 10 hours was detected during our observations in\nthe 2\u201310 kev energy band (see Fig. 1). No similar flux variability was detected below 1 keV. Given that the amount\nof variability is quite small, we extracted only one spectrum for the full observation. This corresponds to a total\nLECS exposure time of 20395 s and MECS exposure time\nof 52478 s. The background files for the spectral analysis were accumulated from the long blank field exposures\navailable from the SDC public ftp site (see Fiore et al.\n1999, Parmar et al. 1999).\nThe HPGSPC and PDS were operated in the customary collimator rocking mode, with each collimator pointing alternatively at the source and at the background for\n96 s. The HPSGPC has a single collimator, thus the whole\ninstrument is looking at the target for half of the time\nand to an offset direction for the other half. The total exposure time in our case was 23258 s. The PDS has two\ncollimators, thus one is always looking at the source and\nthe other one at the background. The total PDS exposure\ntime, for the two collimators, was of about 46.8 ks. The\nbackground subtracted HPGSPC and PDS spectra were\nobtained from the standard pipeline analysis carried out\nat the BeppoSAX Science Data Center.\n\n\fTagliaferri et al.: The 0.1\u2013200 keV spectrum of PKS 2005\u2013489\n\n3\n\n2.2. Spectral Analysis\nFor the spectral analysis, the LECS data have been considered only in the range 0.1\u20134 keV, due to still some unsolved\ncalibration problems at higher energies. To fit the LECS,\nMECS, HPGSPC and PDS spectra together, one has to\nintroduce constant rescaling factors to account for uncertainties in the inter\u2013calibration of the instruments. The\nacceptable values for these constants are in the range 0.7\u2013\n1.0 for the LECS and in the range 0.77\u20130.93 for the PDS,\nwith respect to the MECS. The HPGSPC constant is normally in the range 0.9-1 (Fiore et al. 1999). The spectral\nanalysis was performed with the XSPEC 10.0 package.\nIn the fitting procedure we first considered a single\npower law model plus absorption with the column density fixed at the Galactic value NH = 4.2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 .\nThis model does not give a good fit to the data yielding\na reduced \u03c72r = 2.0 (214 degree of freedom). The fit improved by allowing NH to vary (see Tab. 1). The power\nlaw fit gives a good representation of the 0.1\u2013200 keV X\u2013\nray spectrum, with a relative steep photon spectral index \u03b1 = 2.18. This index is slightly flatter than the one\nmeasured by RossiXTE (\u03b1 = 2.37 \u00b1 0.01 in the 2-10 keV\nenergy band) in the same days (1-2 November, Perlman\net al 1999). Actually, the spectral index determined with\nBeppoSAX is flatter than all spectral indices obtained with\nRossiXTE in the period October December, 1998. The\nflattest RossiXTE spectral index is \u03b1 = 2.32\u00b10.015) measured on November 6, 1998, a few days before the top of\nthe X\u2013ray flare (Perlman et al 1999). Moreover, the very\nhigh statistics of the LECS and MECS spectra show that\nfrom a statistical point of view the power law fit is not acceptable and that a more complex model is required. This\nis also reflected by the fact that the interstellar absorption,\nNH , determined in the best fit procedure is higher, at 90%\nconfidence, than the Galactic value. This implies either\nthe existence of an intrinsic absorption in PKS 2005\u2013489\nwhich seems unlikely, or that we are using a wrong model.\nWe therefore considered a broken power law model\nwhich gave a much better fit, even if we keep the NH fixed\nat the Galactic value. The difference between the two spectral indices, although significant, is small, with the break\nat \u223c 2 keV. The spectral index above the break is the same\nas the single power law, while before the break it is somewhat flatter (see Tab. 1 and Fig. 2). Of course, this break\nat 2 keV could not have been detected by RossiXTE. In\nthis fit the LECS, HPGSPC and PDS intercalibration constant factors have also better values (see notes in Tab. 1).\nClearly we are detecting a downward curved spectrum,\nprobably the declining part of the synchrotron emission.\nThus, we considered a more physical intrinsically curved\nspectral model developed by Fossati et al (2000b). This\nmodel is an analytic expression that assumes a continuously changing slope between two asymptotic limits. It is\nexpressed in a form that provides the following parameters (E1 , \u03b11 , E2 , \u03b12 , EB , f ), where E1 and E2 are the two\n\nFig. 2. LECS+MECS+HPGSPC+PDS spectrum observed on 1\u20132 November 1998, the best fit model is a broken power law model. The NH was fixed to the Galactic\nvalue.\n\"pivoting energies\", while EB and f determine the scale\nlength of the curvature. In order to fit this model to the\ndata we have to fix one parameter for each of the two\npairs (E1 , \u03b11 ) and (E2 , \u03b12 ). If we fix the energy we will\nfind the spectral index at that energy, while if we fix the\nspectral index we will find the energies where it will occur. The latter possibility is very important, because it\nallows us to find the peak of the synchrotron component,\nif this is inside our energy band, and to estimate its uncertainty. This can be obtained by setting one spectral\nindex, for instance \u03b11 = 1, so that the best-fit value of E1\nwill give Epeak . For more details we refer to the Fossati\net al. (2000b) paper. In order to determine the values of\nthe really interesting parameters and their confidence intervals, in the best-fit procedure we kept the absorption\ncolumn density fixed to the Galactic value and f fixed\nto the best-fit value f = 4.5. If we fix the two energies\nat E1 = 0.1 and E2 = 100 keV, we find that the respective photon spectral indices are \u03b11 = 1.98\u22120.03\n+0.02 and\n\u03b12 = 2.23 \u00b1 0.02. We then fixed the photon energy index\n\u03b11 = 2 in order to find the synchrotron peak and indeed\nwe find that Epeak = 1.15\u2212n.c.\n+0.15 keV. This confirms the\npresence of a curved spectrum with a synchrotron peak\nbelow \u223c 1.5 keV. It is in any case remarkable that this\ncurvature from 0.1 up to 100 keV is rather small with respect to other sources. All quoted errors, for the curved\nmodel, are calculated for \u2206\u03c72 = 2.7 that corresponds to\na 90% confidence range for one parameter of interest.\n3.

This aperture contain\na large fraction of the galaxy whose H-flux is comparable\n(\u223c 20% lower) to the H-flux of the nucleus (see Kotilainen\net al. 1998). The values reported in Tab. 2 and Fig. 4 are\nnot corrected for the galaxy contribution. However, on the\nscale of Fig. 4 this correction is negligible and smaller than\nthe size of the infrared data symbols. The calibration in\nterms of log flux in W m\u22122 Hz\u22121 for a zeroth mag star on\nthis system at JHKL are -22.82, -23.01, -23.21 and -23.55\nrespectively.\nAs it is usually found for HBL, there is very little\nchange in the slope of the infrared spectrum as the luminosity changes (see Tab. 2), i.e. the infrared colour of\nthe blazar changes little or not at all. This is due to the\nfact that the synchrotron peak is at much higher energies. Changes in K of up to four mags have been seen in\nsome blazars with little change in their infrared colours\n(e.g. Fan 1999; Hagen-Thorn et al. 1994). In the particular case of PKS 2005\u2013489, the K mag changed only by\n0.32 mag during the observations, which is relatively little\nfor this class of objects.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. SED\nWe observed PKS 2005\u2013489 while it was in a very high\nstate, aiming at detecting a change in its spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) with respect to previous observations.\nVery significant changes of the overall SED were in fact\n\ndetected in other HBL objects, such as MKN 501 (Pian et\nal. 1998) and 1ES 2344+514 (Giommi et al 2000): in these\nobjects, during flares, the synchrotron peak frequency increased by 2\u20133 orders of magnitudes with respect to quiescent states. These observations provide new conditions\nthat the various models have to reproduce, exploring new\nrange of values for the physical parameters and allowing\nus to investigate the accelerating mechanisms inside the\njets.\nIn the case of PKS 2005\u2013489, the X\u2013ray data can be\nfitted equally well by a broken power law and by a continuously steepening model. Although the spectral parameters\nare not very different, the two models predict a quite different frequency for the peak of the synchrotron emission,\nas illustrated in the two panels of Fig. 4. In the case of a\nbroken power law in fact, it can be possible to interpret\nthe entire far\u2013IR to hard X\u2013ray SED as due to a single\nsynchrotron component, peaking at \u223c 1015 Hz. If, instead,\nthe X\u2013ray data are fitted by the continuously steepening\nmodel, then the synchrotron peak is at \u223c 0.1 keV, and the\nIR flux must be produced by another jet component. This\nuncertainty in locating the synchrotron peak frequency\noriginated the two possible sets of parameters of the homogeneous synchrotron self Compton model by which we\ncan interpret the overall SED, discussed below.\nIn any case, our data show that the source was in a very\nhigh state and that the 0.1\u2013200 keV spectrum is well fitted\nby a spectrum due to synchrotron emission only. In Fig. 3\nwe plot an enlargement of the SED in the X\u2013ray spectral\nregion. It can be seen that PKS 2005\u2013489 underwent dramatic flux changes, but, at least above \u223c1 keV, the spectral shape was always steeper than unity, constraining the\npeak of the synchrotron emission to be at lower energies.\nOur X\u2013ray spectrum is the flattest ever observed, even\nconsidering the many observations by RossiXTE during\nthe same period of our 1998 BeppoSAX observation (Perlman et al. 1999).\n4.2. Limits on magnetic field and particle energies\nThe spectral properties of our X\u2013ray data indicate that the\ndominating radiation process is synchrotron. Therefore\n\n\fTagliaferri et al.: The 0.1\u2013200 keV spectrum of PKS 2005\u2013489\n\nFig. 3. The X\u2013ray energy spectra of PKS 2005\u2013489 as\nobserved at different epochs by different satellites. Source\nof data: Sambruna et al 1994b (EXOSAT), Comastri et\nal. 1997 (ROSAT), Perlman et al. 1999 (RossiXTE).\n\nthe emission is due to the most energetic electrons, suffering rapid radiation energy losses. During our observation the flux variability was modest (10% on a timescale of\nabout 10 hours), but EXOSAT, in two occasions, observed\nflux changes of a factor of about 4 in 4\u20135 hours (Giommi et\nal. 1990). We can then require that the emitting electrons\ncool radiatively (by synchrotron and inverse Compton) on\nthese timescales, implying a lower limit on the magnetic\nfield. Assuming equal radiation and magnetic energy densities, using tvar = 4 hours and \u03bdx = 1 \u00d7 1017 Hz, we\nderive B \u221a\n> 0.3\u03b4 \u22121/3 Gauss and \u03b3x < 3 \u00d7 105 \u03b4 \u22121/3 . Here\n\u03b4 = [\u0393 \u2212 \u03932 \u2212 1 cos \u03b8]\u22121 is the Doppler beaming factor,\nwhere \u03b8 is the viewing angle.\n4.3. Homogeneous SSC model\nWe have fitted the SED of PKS 2005\u2013489 with a pure,\nhomogeneous and one zone SSC model, assuming no contribution from the photons produced externally to the jet\nas seeds for the Compton scattering process. This class of\nSSC models is completely constrained once the peak energies and their fluxes are known. Unfortunately, in our case\nonly the X\u2013ray and IR data are simultaneous, and the location of both peaks (particularly the Compton one), is\nsomewhat uncertain. However, the X\u2013ray data alone constrain the synchrotron peak to be at or below the low\nenergy end of the BeppoSAX range (i.e. \u2264 0.1 keV). For\nthe high energy part of the SED we have considered the\nprevious observation by EGRET, resulting in a marginal\ndetection, see Fig. 4, (Lin et al. 1997; von Montigny et\nal. 1995) and the TeV upper limit given by CANGAROO\n(Roberts et al. 1999). These data constrain the Compton\npeak to be close to 1025 Hz.\n\n5\n\nGiven the uncertainty in the location of the synchrotron peak, we have considered two models, shown in\nthe two panels of Fig. 4. The top panel shows the X\u2013ray\ndata fitted by a broken power law model, and in this case\nit is possible that the simultaneous IR flux is produced in\nthe same region producing the high energy emission. We\nhave then considered a source with size R = 1.5 \u00d7 1016\ncm and a beaming factor \u03b4 = 18, resulting in a minimum\nobserved variability timescale of \u223c6 hours, which is typical for this class of sources, and close to the minimum\nvariability timescale observed in this source by EXOSAT\n(Giommi et al. 1990). With these values of the size and\nbeaming factor, the magnetic field is constrained to be of\nthe order of B = 1 Gauss, in order to have nearly equal\nsynchrotron and self\u2013Compton luminosities, as observed.\nThe intrinsic power (assumed to be continuously injected\nthroughout the source in the form of relativistic electrons)\nis required to be Linj = 5.5 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 . The relativistic\nelectrons are assumed to be injected with a power law energy distribution of slope s = 2.2 between \u03b3min = 3 \u00d7 103\nand \u03b3max = 106 . The value s = 2.2 is required to match\nthe slope of the X\u2013ray spectrum. The resulting SSC spectrum is shown as a solid line in the top panel of Fig. 4.\nIt can be seen that this model also agrees with the (admittedly uncertain) flux in the EGRET band, and well\ndescribes the entire SED (except for the mm\u2013radio part,\nwhich should come from larger jet regions, less affected by\nsynchrotron self\u2013absorption at these frequencies). Being\nproduced by the same region, we expect some variability\ncorrelations between the IR and X\u2013ray flux. In particular,\nif the radiative cooling time at both frequencies is shorter\nthan the light crossing time, then it is the latter timescale\nthat is observed in both energy bands. With the adopted\nparameters, this is indeed the case: at the observed frequency \u03bd = 3 \u00d7 1014 Hz, the intrinsic cooling time is half\nthe crossing time.\nThe bottom panel of Fig. 4 shows the X\u2013ray data fitted\nby the continuously steepening model. In this case the IR\nflux cannot be produced by the same region emitting the\nX\u2013rays, resulting in a significantly larger frequency of the\nsynchrotron peak. The adopted parameters of the SSC\nmodel are similar to the previous case (see the caption\nof Fig. 4). The only significant difference is the value of\n\u03b3min = 1.5 \u00d7 104 , now much larger.\nIn this case we predict/expect that the IR flux has a\ndifferent variability behavior than the X\u2013ray flux, since it\nwould probably be produced in a larger region of the jet,\nwith a smaller value of the magnetic field, making the cooling time of the IR emitting electrons longer. Furthermore,\nif the variability is caused by a perturbation of a steady jet\npropagating from the inner to the outer regions, we expect\nsome delay between the X\u2013ray and the IR flux variations,\ngiving information about the relative distance of the two\nregions.\n\n\f6\n\nTagliaferri et al.: The 0.1\u2013200 keV spectrum of PKS 2005\u2013489\n\nAcknowledgements.
