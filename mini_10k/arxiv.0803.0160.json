In this paper we develop a method\nthat leads to an effective procedure which finds an algebraic expression of some\npower of f in terms of the elements of F and their derivatives (or shows that\nsuch an expression does not exist). This procedure is called effective differential\nNullstellensatz. A brute-force algorithm solving this problem consists of two\nsteps:\n(1) find an upper bound h on the number of differentiations one needs to\napply to F and\n(2) find an upper bound on the degrees of polynomial coefficients gi and a\npositive integer k\nsuch that f k is a combination of the elements of F together with the derivatives up to the order h and the coefficients gi . We solve the first problem in\nthe paper. The second problem was addressed and solved in [2] and further\nanalyzed and improved in [3,4]. A purely algebraic solution was given in [5].\nMost of the references on the subject can be found in [6\u20139].\nMore precisely, our problem is as follows. We are given a finite set F of differential polynomials such that a differential polynomial f belongs to the radical\ndifferential ideal generated by F in the ring of differential polynomials. Knowing only the orders and degrees of the elements of F and the order of f , we\nfind a non-negative integer h such that f belongs to the radical of the algebraic\nideal generated by F and its derivatives up to the order h.\nWe give a complete solution to this problem using differential elimination.\nThe problem is non-trivial: the first (unsuccessful) attempt was made by Seidenberg [1], where it was conjectured that most likely such a bound would\nnot be found. Here is where the main difficulty is coming from. In order to\nget the bound using a differential elimination algorithm we need to estimate\nhow many differentiation steps this algorithm makes. Originally, termination\nproofs for such algorithms were based on the Ritt-Noetherianity of the ring of\nEmail addresses: Oleg.Golubitsky@gmail.com (Oleg Golubitsky),\nkondrmar@rol.ru (Marina Kondratieva), aiovchin@math.uic.edu (Alexey\nOvchinnikov), aszanto@ncsu.edu (Agnes Szanto).\n1 The work was partially supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research,\nproject no. 05-01-00671.\n2 This author was also partially supported by NSF Grant CCR-0096842.\n3 This author was also partially supported by NSERC Grant PDF-301108-2004.\n4 This author was also partially supported by NSF Grant CCR-0347506\n\n2\n\n\fdifferential polynomials, that is: every increasing chain of radical differential\nideals terminates. And this result does not say when the sequence terminates.\nWe overcome this problem in our paper.\nThe article is organized as follows. We introduce basic notions of differential\nalgebra in Section 2. Then we formulate the main result, Theorem 1, in Section 3. In order to achieve this, we bound the length of increasing sequences\nof radical differential ideals appearing in our differential elimination in Section 5 (see Proposition 9). For that, in Section 4, we first bound the length\nof dicksonian sequences of tuples of natural numbers with restricted growth\nof the maximal element in these tuples (Lemma 8). Finally, we apply this\nto obtain the bound for the differential Nullstellensatz in Theorem 15, from\nwhich Theorem 1 follows. We conclude by giving in Section 6 an alternative\nnon-constructive proof of existence of the bound, based on model theory.\nThere is some previous work on bounding orders in differential elimination\nalgorithms. In the ordinary case, we can bound the orders of derivatives of\nthe output and all intermediate steps of differential elimination [10], and this\nbound holds for any ranking. Also in the ordinary case, one can give bounds\nfor quantifier elimination [11] and for the orders and degrees of resolvents of\nprime differential ideals of a certain type [12]. A related bound for involutive prolongation, based on the analysis of stability of Spencer sequences, is\nobtained in [13].\nNote that, unlike the bounds for differential elimination mentioned above, the\nbound for the differential Nullstellensatz proposed in this paper holds for the\nPDE case. Our bound is also based on the analysis of differential elimination.\nBut, due to the ranking-independent nature of the differential Nullstellensatz,\nwe could restrict our analysis to orderly rankings, which allowed us to treat\nnot only the ordinary case, but the PDE case as well.\n\n2\n\nBasic differential algebra\n\nOne can find recent tutorials on the constructive theory of differential ideals in\n[14\u201316]. One also refers to [1,17\u201326] for differential elimination theory. A differential ring is a commutative ring with unity endowed with a set of derivations\n\u2206 = {\u22021 , . . . , \u2202m }, which commute pairwise. The case\nn of \u2206 = {\u03b4} is calledoorkm\nki > 0 of\ndinary. Construct the multiplicative monoid \u0398 = \u22021k1 \u22022k2 * * * \u2202m\nderivative operators. Let Y = {y1 , . . . , yn } be a set whose elements are called\ndifferential indeterminates. The elements of the set \u0398Y = {\u03b8y | \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398, y \u2208\nY } are called derivatives. Derivative operators from \u0398 act on derivatives as\n\u03b81 (\u03b82 yi ) = (\u03b81 \u03b82 )yi for all \u03b81 , \u03b82 \u2208 \u0398 and 1 6 i 6 n.\n3\n\n\fThe ring of differential polynomials in differential indeterminates Y over a\ndifferential field k is a ring of commutative polynomials with coefficients in\nk in the infinite set of variables \u0398Y . This ring is denoted by k{y1 , . . . , yn }.\nWe consider the case of char k = 0 only. An ideal I in k{y1 , . . . , yn } is called\ndifferential, if for all f \u2208 I and \u03b4 \u2208 \u2206, \u03b4f \u2208 I. Let F \u2282 k{y1 , . . . , yn } be a\nset of differential polynomials. For the differential and radical differential ideal\ngenerated by F in k{y1 , . . . , yn }, we use notations [F ] and {F }, respectively.\nA ranking is a total order > on the set \u0398Y satisfying the following conditions\nfor all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398 and u, v \u2208 \u0398Y :\n(1) \u03b8u > u,\n(2) u > v =\u21d2 \u03b8u > \u03b8v.\nkm\nLet u be a derivative, that is, u = \u03b8yj for \u03b8 = \u22021k1 \u03b42k2 * * * \u2202m\n\u2208 \u0398 and 1 6 j 6 n.\nThe order of u is defined as\n\nord u = ord \u03b8 = k1 + . . . + km .\nIf f is a differential polynomial, f 6\u2208 k, then ord f denotes the maximal order\nof derivatives appearing effectively in f .\nA ranking > is called orderly if ord u > ord v implies u > v for all derivatives\nu and v. Let a ranking > be fixed. The derivative \u03b8yj of the highest rank appearing in a differential polynomial f \u2208 k{y1 , . . . , yn } \\ k is called the leader of\nf . We denote the leader by ld f or uf . Represent f as a univariate polynomial\nin uf :\nf = if udf + a1 ud\u22121\n+ . . . + ad .\nf\nThe monomial udf is called the rank of f and is denoted by rk f. Extend the\nranking relation on derivatives to ranks: ud11 > ud22 if either u1 > u2 or u1 = u2\nand d1 > d2 . The polynomial if is called the initial of f . Apply any derivation\n\u03b4 \u2208 \u2206 to f :\n\u2202f\n\u03b4f =\n\u03b4uf + \u03b4if udf + \u03b4a1 ud\u22121\n+ . . . + \u03b4ad .\nf\n\u2202uf\nThe leader of \u03b4f is \u03b4uf and the initial of \u03b4f is called the separant of f , denoted\nsf . If \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398 \\ {1}, then \u03b8f is called a proper derivative of f . Note that the\ninitial of any proper derivative of f is equal to sf .\nWe say that a differential polynomial f is partially reduced w.r.t. g if no proper\nderivative of ug appears in f . A differential polynomial f is algebraically reduced w.r.t. g if degug f < degug g. A differential polynomial f is reduced w.r.t.\na differential polynomial g if f is partially and algebraically reduced w.r.t. g.\nConsider any subset A \u2282 k{y1 , . . . , yn } \\ k. We say that A is autoreduced\n(respectively, algebraically autoreduced) if each element of A is reduced (respectively, algebraically reduced) w.r.t. all the others.\n4\n\n\fEvery autoreduced set is finite [18, Chapter I, Section 9] (but an algebraically\nautoreduced set in a ring of differential polynomials may be infinite). For\nautoreduced sets we use capital calligraphic letters A, B, C, . . . and notation\nA = A1 , . . . , Ap to specify the list of the elements of A arranged in order of\nincreasing rank. We denote the sets of initials and separants of elements of A\nby iA and sA , respectively. Let HA = iA \u222a sA . For a finite set S of differential\npolynomials denote by S \u221e the multiplicative set containing 1 and generated\nby S. Let I be an ideal in a commutative ring R. The saturated ideal I : S \u221e\nis defined as {a \u2208 R | \u2203s \u2208 S \u221e : sa \u2208 I}. If I is a differential ideal then I : S \u221e\nis also a differential ideal (see [18]).\nLet A = A1 , . . . , Ar and B = B1 , . . . , Bs be (algebraically) autoreduced sets.\nWe say that A has lower rank than B if\n\u2022 there exists k 6 min(r, s) such that rk Ai = rk Bi for 1 6 i < k, and\nrk Ak < rk Bk ,\n\u2022 or if r > s and rk Ai = rk Bi for 1 6 i 6 s.\nWe say that rk A = rk B if r = s and rk Ai = rk Bi for 1 6 i 6 r. Let v be\na derivative in k{y1 , . . . , yn }. Denote by Av the set of the elements of A and\ntheir derivatives that have a leader ranking strictly lower than v. A set A is\ncalled coherent if whenever A, B \u2208 A are such that uA and uB have a common\nderivative: v = \u03c8uA = \u03c6uB , then sB \u03c8A \u2212 sA \u03c6B \u2208 (Av ) : HA\u221e .\n3\n\nMain result\n\nFor a finite set of differential polynomials F \u2282 k{y1 , . . . , yn } let D(F ) be the\nmaximal total degree of a polynomial in F . For each i, 1 6 i 6 n, let\nhi (F ) = ordyi (F ),\n\nH(F ) = max hi (F ).\n16i6n\n\nFor h \u2208 Z>0 let F (6h) denote the set of derivatives of the elements of F of\norder less than or equal to h. The Ackermann function appearing in our main\nresult is defined as follows [27, Section 2.5.5]:\nA(0, n) = n + 1\nA(m + 1, 0) = A(m, 1)\nA(m + 1, n + 1) = A(m, A(m + 1, n)).\nTheorem 1 Let F \u2282 k{y1 , . . . , yn } be a finite set, 0 6=qf \u2208 {F } and let\nt(F, f ) be the minimal non-negative integer such that f \u2208 (F (6t(F,f )) ). Then\nt(F, f ) 6 A(m + 8, max(n, H(F \u222a f ), D(F \u222a f ))).\n5\n\n\fPROOF. This result will be proved step-by-step in the following sections as\ndescribed in the introduction and finally established in Theorem 15.\nRemark 2 It is our own choice here to bound t(F, f ) using solely the maximal orders and degrees of F and f . One might come up with another bound\nusing more information of F and f . But we emphasise that the bound on orders must depend on the degrees, number of differential indeterminates, and\nnumber of basic differentiations as the following examples show.\no\n\nn\n\nExample 3 Let f = 1 and F = y \u2032 \u2212 1, y k in k{y}, the ordinary case. In\norder to express 1 in terms of the elements of F , one has to differentiate y k k\ntimes.\nIn the linear and non-linear cases, consider the following examples showing\nthat the bound must depend on the number of variables and derivations.\nExample 4 Let f = 1 and F = {y1\u2032 , y1 \u2212 y2\u2032 , . . . , yn\u22121 \u2212 yn\u2032 , yn \u2212 a} in the\nordinary differential ring k{y1 , . . . , yn }, where a \u2208 k is such that a(n) = 1.\nWe have to differentiate the first n \u2212 1 generators n times to get yn(n) into the\ncorresponding algebraic ideal. Hence, t(F, f ) = n.\nExample 5 Let f = 1 and F = {y12 , y1 \u2212 y22 , . . . , yn\u22121 \u2212 yn2 , 1 \u2212 yn\u2032 } \u2282\nk{y1 , . . . , yn }, again in the ordinary case.

Again, the\ngenerators will have to be differentiated 2m times to express 1.\n\n4\n\nBounds on lengths of sequences\n\nThe results of this section with be further used in Section 5 to bound lengths\nof decreasing sequences of autoreduced sets appearing in the differential elimination algorithm that we use. In this section the letters m and n will not\nmean the number of derivations and differential indeterminates, respectively.\nWe begin by bounding the length of certain sequences of non-negative n-tuples.\nCall a sequence t1 , t2 , . . . , tk of n-tuples dicksonian, if for all 1 6 i < j 6 k,\nthere does not exist a non-negative n-tuple t such that ti +t = tj . For example,\nany lexicographically decreasing sequence is dicksonian. By Dickson's Lemma,\nevery dicksonian sequence is finite. Our goal is to obtain an explicit upper\nbound for the length of a dicksonian sequence, whose elements do not grow\nfaster than a given function, in terms of this function, the first element, and\nthe size n of the tuples. Let\n(a11 , . . . , a1n ), (a21 , . . . , a2n ), . . . , (ak1 , . . . , akn )\nbe a dicksonian sequence of n-tuples of non-negative integers such that\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nmax aj1 , . . . , ajn 6 f (j)\n\n(1)\n\nfor all j, 1 6 j 6 k, where\nf : Z>0 \u2192 Z>0\n\nis a fixed function. We say that the growth of this sequence is bounded by the\nfunction f .\nThe following proposition closely resembles a particular case of our problem,\nnamely that of f (i) = m + i \u2212 1. However, in Proposition 7 the maximal\ncoordinate must increase by 1 at each step, whereas in our case it is allowed to\ndecrease or remain the same. We will reduce the case of a dicksonian sequence\nwith the growth bounded by a function f from a certain large class of functions\nthat \"do not grow too fast\", to the one treated in Proposition 7.\nProposition 7 [28, Proposition 1] Let t1 , t2 , . . . , tk be a dicksonian sequence\nof n-tuples, such that the maximal coordinate of ti equals m + i \u2212 1, for all\n1 6 i 6 k. Then the maximal coordinate in the last tuple, tk , does not exceed\nA(n, m \u2212 1) \u2212 1, and there exists such a dicksonian sequence for which this\nbound is reached.\n7\n\n\fNote that in Proposition 7 we have: m is the maximal coordinate of t1 and\nthe length k of the sequence is bounded by A(n, m \u2212 1) \u2212 m. The general case\n(of any function f , not necessarily from our class) has also been studied in\n[29] using a different approach. It is shown that the maximal possible length\nis primitive recursive in f and recursive, but not primitive recursive (if f\nincreases at least linearly), in n. Sequences yielding the maximal possible\nlength are constructed. Moreover, if f is linear, an explicit expression for the\nmaximal length is given in terms of a generalized Ackermann function. Our\nstatement was motivated by the need to obtain an explicit expression for the\nbound for a wider class of growth functions.\nLet Lf,n denote the maximal length of a dicksonian sequence of n-tuples,\nwhose growth is bounded by f . For an increasing function f : Z>0 \u2192 Z>0 , let\n\u2308f \u22121 (x)\u2309 be the least number k such that f (k) > x.\nLemma 8 Let f : Z>0 \u2192 Z>0 be an increasing function, and d \u2208 Z>0 be a\nnumber such that f (i + 1) \u2212 f (i) 6 A(d, f (i) \u2212 1) for all i > 0. Then\nl\n\n\u0010\n\nLf,n < f \u22121 A(n + d, f (1) \u2212 1)\n\n\u0011m\n\n(2)\n\nand the maximal entry of the last n-tuple does not exceed A(n + d, f (1) \u2212 1).\nPROOF. Consider a disckonian sequence\n(a11 , . . . , a1n ), (a21 , . . . , a2n ), . . . , (ak1 , . . . , akn ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhose growth is bounded by f . Construct from (3) a new sequence satisfying\nthe conditions of Proposition 7. Append to the first tuple d new coordinates,\neach equal to f (1), obtaining the following (n + d)-tuple:\n(a11 , . . . , a1n , f (1), . . . , f (1)).\nThen add f (2) \u2212 f (1) \u2212 1 new (n + d)-tuples. The first n coordinates of these\ntuples are (a11 , . . . , a1n ). The last d coordinates form a dicksonian sequence of dtuples, starting with (f (1), . . . , f (1)), with the maximum coordinate growing\nexactly by 1 at each step. From Proposition 7 and condition f (2) \u2212 f (1) 6\nA(d, f (1) \u2212 1), such sequence exists. The last tuple will have the maximum\ncoordinate equal to f (2) \u2212 1. Next, add the tuple\n(a21 , . . . , a2n , f (2), . . . , f (2)).\nSince the growth of (3) is bounded by f , the maximal coordinate in this tuple\nequals f (2). Continue by adding f (3) \u2212 f (2) \u2212 1 new (n + d)-tuples, whose\nfirst n coordinates are (a21 , . . . , a2n ) and last d coordinates form a dicksonian\nsequence growing by 1 at each step. Finally, when the tuple\n(ak1 , . . . , akn , f (k), . . . , f (k))\n8\n\n\fis reached, stop. We obtain a sequence of (n + d)-tuples in which the maximal coordinate grows by 1 at each step. We will show that this sequence is\ndicksonian. Suppose that it is not. Let tj , tl , j < l, be two (n + d)-tuples from\nthis sequence, for which there exists a tuple t such that tl = tj + t. Let tI , tII\ndenote the first n coordinates and the last d coordinates of an (n + d)-tuple\nII\nII\nt, respectively. Then we have tIl = tIj + tI and tII\nl = tj + t . If tj and tl have\nbeen added after the same tuple of the form\npi = (ai1 , . . . , ain , f (i), . . . , f (i)),\nor if tj coincides with such a tuple pi and tl has been added after pi , the\nII\nII\nequality tII\ncontradicts the fact that the last d coordinates of the\nl = tj + t\ntuples between pi and pi+1 , including pi and excluding pi+1 , form a dicksonian sequence. If tj and tl have been added after different tuples pi and pi\u2032 ,\nthe equality tIl = tIj + tI contradicts the fact that sequence (3) is dicksonian.\nTherefore, our assumption was false and the constructed sequence is dicksonian.\nBy Proposition 7, the maximum coordinate of its last element does not exceed\nA(n + d, m \u2212 1) \u2212 1. Since the maximum coordinate in the first element is\nf (1) and grows by 1 at each step, the number of elements in the constructed\nsequence does not exceed A(n + d, f (1) \u2212 1) \u2212 f (1). On the other hand, the\nnumber of elements in the constructed sequence is:\nf (2) \u2212 f (1) + f (3) \u2212 f (2) + . . . + f (k) \u2212 f (k \u2212 1) + 1 = f (k) \u2212 f (1) + 1.\nTherefore,\nthat is,\nand\n\nf (k) \u2212 f (1) + 1 6 A(n + d, f (1) \u2212 1) \u2212 f (1),\nf (k) < A(n + d, f (1) \u2212 1),\nl\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011m\n\nk < f \u22121 A(n + d, f (1) \u2212 1) .\n5\n\nDifferential elimination algorithm\n\nUsing the result of the previous section, we obtain an upper bound for the\nlength of sequences of autoreduced sets of decreasing rank produced by a\ndifferential elimination algorithm. The idea is to put in correspondence with\nsuch a sequence a dicksonian sequence of tuples, whose growth is bounded by\na function derived from the algorithm.\nWe fix an orderly ranking. Algorithm 1 computes a characteristic decomposition of a radical differential ideal given by a set of generators. It is designed\n9\n\n\fin such a way that allows us to control the orders and degrees of differential\npolynomials occurring in all intermediate steps together with a bound on the\nnumber of iterations of this algorithm. Also, in the algorithm the procedure\nalgrem computes an algebraic pseudo-remainder of a polynomial with respect\nto an algebraic triangular set (a set is called triangular if the leaders of its\nelements are distinct). Algorithm MinimalTriangularSubset inputs a finite set\nof differential polynomials and outputs one of its least rank triangular subsets.\nAlgorithm CharSet inputs a finite set of differential polynomials and outputs\none of its characteristic sets, that is, an autoreduced subset of the least rank.\nDenote by \u2206(C) the set of \"differential S-polynomials\" of C defined in [14, Definition 4.2]. From now on, m and n again denote the numbers of derivations\nand differential indeterminates, respectively.\nAlgorithm 1 RGBound(F1 )\nInput: a set F1 \u2282 k{y1 , . . . , yn } with derivations {\u22021 , . . . , \u2202m }\nOutput: A finite set T of triangular sets such that {F1 } =\n\nT\n\nC\u2208T\n\nif 1 \u2208\n/ [C] : HC\u221e then C is coherent and autoreduced\n\n[C] : HC\u221e ;\n\notherwise 1 \u2208 (C) : HC\u221e .\nT := {\u2205}; U := {(F1 , \u2205)}\nwhile U 6= \u2205 do\nTake and remove any (F, C) \u2208 U\nf := an element of F reduced w.r.t.

In the first five lines of the loop\nthe degrees do not change as adding an initial or a separant does not cause an\nincrease in the degrees.\n\u0010 \u0011 So, the first place where the degrees may change is the\ncomputation of \u2206 C \u0304 , that is, computing cross differentiations. This at most\ndoubles the degrees. After that, the only places where the degrees of polynomials may increase are calls to algrem(g, B) for g \u2208 G or algrem (h, B \\ {h}) for\nh \u2208 B. In both cases it is a sequence of at most |B| algebraic pseudodivision.\nWe will prove the bound for the reduction of a fixed g \u2208 G modulo B, and the\nother case follows similarly.\nAssume that |B| = N, and let B = {B1 , . . . , BN } be ordered such that\nld(B1 ) > ld(B2 ) > * * * > ld(BN ).\nLet g (0) := g and g (t) := algrem (g, {B1 , . . . Bt }) for t > 0. Denote the maximal\ntotal degree of g (t) \u222a B by \u03b4(t), t > 0. Note that \u03b4(0) 6 2D(Fi \u222a Ci ). Then\ng (t+1) is obtained by the pseudo-division of g (t) with respect to the polynomial\nBt+1 . Thus,\ng (t+1) = i\u01ebBt+1 g (t) \u2212 qBt+1 ,\nwhere \u01eb is a sufficiently large exponent specified below, q is the pseudoquotient, and the degree of g (t+1) in ld(Bt+1 ) is smaller that the same degree\nof Bt+1 .

Algorithm 1 removes an element (F, C) from U and within one iteration of the while-loop it\nconverts this element into one, two, or three elements. Moreover, if the set C\ndoes not change, the orders and degrees of the elements of F do not increase\nafter the conversion. We call such an iteration incomplete. Denote the maximal number of all (complete and incomplete) iterations of the while-loop of\nAlgorithm 1 by L(F ).\nProposition 10 Algorithm 1 is correct and terminates. Moreover,\nL(F ) 6 log2 (A(m + 7, Q(F ) \u2212 1)),\nwhere\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nQ(F ) = max 9, n, 29H(F ) , D(F ) .\n\n(4)\n\nPROOF.

We will\nshow the opposite inclusion by induction on the number of iterations of the\nloop (not assuming that it is finite). Invariant (5) holds at the beginning of\nthe first iteration (T = \u2205, U = (F1 , \u2205)). Let a finite number of iterations of\nthe loop be executed preserving the invariant. Suppose that at the next step\nwe remove an element (F, C) from U. Let C \u0304 be either the set\u0010added\n\u0011 to T (in\n \u0304\nthis case we let F\u0304 = \u2205), or the second element of the pair F\u0304 , C returned\nback to U.

To each element of U we associate an (m + 4)-tuple in such a way that\nthe sequence of these vectors for each element of U is dicksonian. Note that\nby our definition L(F ) is the maximal length of such dicksonian sequence. At\nthe beginning, the set U consists of one element only. We associate the vector\n\u03c40 = (0, . . . , 0, n, n, D(F ))\nto it. Let an element (F, C) with vector \u03c4 be under processing of the loop and\nlet f be an element of F reduced with respect to C and of minimal rank with\nthis property.\nIf an incomplete iteration occurs, we add an element of the form (F \u222a{g}, C) to\nU. The degree of g is less than the one of f (this is either the initial or separant\nof f ). We then transform the vector \u03c4 by replacing the last its component by\nD(g). If \u0010the iteration\nis complete then U is concatenated with a converted\n\u0011\n \u0304\nelement F\u0304 , C . In this case we change the components of \u03c4 in the following\nim\n. Consider the\nway. Let rk f = (\u03b8yj )d be the rank of f , where \u03b8 = \u22021i1 . . . \u2202m\n(m + 4)-tuple\n\u03c4\u0304 = (i1 , . . . , im , d, j, n \u2212 j, deg(g)),\nwhere g is the element of F\u0304 reduced with respect to C \u0304 and of minimal rank.\nProceeding in the described way from \u03c4 to \u03c4\u0304 , let \u03c4k denote the (m + 4)-tuple\ncorresponding to the k-th iteration of the while-loop. Since f is reduced w.r.t.\nC, the sequence \u03c40 , \u03c41 , \u03c42 , . . . is dicksonian. Therefore, the number of iterations\nfor each element is bounded. This proves termination of Algorithm 1. Note\nthat if we remove n \u2212 j from \u03c4\u0304 , the sequence might not be dicksonian. Indeed,\nlet F = {y1 , y2} \u2282 k{y1 , y2, y3 } with y1 < y2 < y3 . We then would have\n\u03c41 = (0, 1, 1, 1) and \u03c42 = (0, 1, 2, 1).\nLet H1 = max(H(F1 ), m), Hk+1 = 2Hk , D1 = D(F1 ), and\nDk+1 = (4Dk )(\n13\n\n2Hk +m\nm\n\n)+1 .\n\n\fBy Proposition 9, the maximal coordinate of the (m + 4)-tuple \u03c4k does not\nexceed max(Hk , Dk , n).

Assuming that they hold for Hk , Dk , and\nuk , prove them for Hk+1 , Dk+1 , uk+1. Since Hk+1 = 2Hk , we have\n\u0010\n\n29Hk+1 = 29*2Hk = 29Hk\nbecause uk > 9.

In this\nsection we refer the reader for ultrafilters and construction of ultraproducts\nto books in model theory, for instance [31,32]. Let k\u0304 be the differential closure\nof k (see [33, Definition 3.2] and the references given there) and q \u2208 Z>0 . We\nwould like to emphasise that in the statement below we had to fix in advance\nthe number r of differential polynomials in F to be able to use ultraproducts.\nSo, in Theorem 16 the variable r is quantified before the bounding function\n\u03b2. However, the constructive bound that we obtained in Theorem 15 does not\nhave such a restriction, because it depends solely on the orders and degrees in\nF and f , but not on the number of elements in F .\nTheorem 16 For every r \u2208 Z>0 there exists a function \u03b2 : Z>0 3 \u2192 Z>0 such\nthat for any q \u2208 Z>0 and F \u2282 k{y1 , . . . , yn } with\n|F | = r, max(H(F ), D(F )) 6 q, and 1 \u2208 [F ]\nwe have\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n1 \u2208 F (6\u03b2(q,r,n)) .\n20\n\n\fPROOF. Assume that the statement is wrong, that is, there exist r, q \u2208 Z>0\nsuch that for any \u03b1 \u2208 Z>0 there exist p1,\u03b1 , . . . , pr,\u03b1 \u2208 k{y1 , . . . , yn } with\nmax(H(pij ), D(pij )) 6 q\nsuch that\n1 \u2208 [p1,\u03b1 , . . . , pr,\u03b1 ]\n\nand\n\n1 6=\n\nr X\n\u03b1\nX\n\n(j)\n\nqi,j pi,\u03b1\n\n(16)\n\ni=1 j=0\n\nfor all qi,j \u2208 k{y1 , . . . , yn } of order less than or equal to q + \u03b1.

Since V1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 Vr \u2208 U\nand \u2205 \u2208\n/ U, there is an index\nj \u2208 V1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 Vr .\n21\n\n\fTherefore,\np1,j (z1,j , . . . , zn,j ) = . . . = pr,j (z1,j , . . . , zn,j ) = 0.\nSince k\u0304 is differentially closed, this contradicts to 1 \u2208 [p1,j , . . . , pr,j ] in the\ndifferential ring k\u0304{y1 , . . . , yn }. Therefore, since the field KM is differentially\nclosed, we have 1 \u2208 [p \u03041 , . . . , p \u0304r ]. Hence, there exist \u03b3 \u2208 Z>0 and differential\npolynomials q \u0304ij \u2208 KM {y1 , . . . , yn } with ord q \u0304ij < \u03b3 + q so that\n1=\n\n\u03b3\nr X\nX\n\nq \u0304ij p\u0304i (j) .\n\ni=1 j=0\n\nAgain, due to our choice of M (that is, due to the fact that U is an ultrafilter),\nthere exists \u03b1 \u2208 Z>0 with \u03b1 > \u03b3 such that\n1=\n\n\u03b3\nr X\nX\n\n(j)\n\nqij pi,\u03b1 ,\n\ni=1 j=0\n\nwhere qi,j \u2208 k\u0304{y1 , . . . , yn } of order less than \u03b1 + q. Since pi,\u03b1 \u2208 k{y1 , . . . , yn }\nfor all i, 1 6 i 6 r, by taking a basis of k\u0304 over k we may assume that in fact\nqi,j \u2208 k{y1 , . . . , yn } for all i and j, 1 6 i 6 r, 0 6 j 6 \u03b3. This contradicts\nto (16). Thus, our initial assumption was wrong.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have obtained the first bound on orders for the differential Nullstellensatz.\nSurely, one can improve the bound and find many applications of it. A general\nprogramme which is being realized here is as follows. The differential elimination algorithms would be very useful for applications if there were faster\nversions of them. Our work on bounding orders could lead to:\n(1) understanding complexity estimates for the differential elimination,\n(2) developing combined and separated differential and high performance\nalgebraic algorithms.\nOne of the ideas is, instead of using the usual differential elimination, perform\nall differentiations at the beginning of the process and then use only fast algebraic methods. We hope that our bounds will contribute to this programme.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Michael Singer for very helpful comments, support, and for the\nmodel theoretic proof of the differential Nullstellensatz.
