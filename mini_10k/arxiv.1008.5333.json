Since a quantum state actually corresponds\nto a ray of vectors, identification is only required for the projectivisation of the Hilbert spaces. This amounts\nto the existence of a natural projectively flat connection on the bundle of Hilbert spaces over the space of\npolarisations. When the symplectic manifold is K\u00e4hler, it is convenient to consider a subclass of polarisations\nthat come from complex structures compatible with the symplectic form. Given such a complex structure,\nthe quantum Hilbert space is the space of holomorphic sections of the pre-quantum line bundle. However,\nunder quite general conditions (satisfied by, for example, the 2-sphere), there is no naturally projectively flat\nconnection in the bundle of quantum Hilbert spaces [10].\nThe next best scenario is that projective flatness holds if we limit the polarisations to a smaller subset, for\nexample, to those respecting the symmetry of the system. For a symplectic vector space polarised by linear\ncomplex structures, there is indeed a natural projectively flat connection in the bundle of Hilbert spaces [1].\nMoreover, the connection is flat if we include metaplectic correction [29, 15]. Parallel transport in the bundle\nyields the familiar Fourier and Segal-Bargmann transforms that are usually used to identify wave functions\nin various pictures [15]. (The Segal-Bargmann transform can be generalised to relate polarisations on the\ncotangent bundles of compact Lie groups [11, 9].) Another example of projective flatness is from quantising\nthe space of flat connections on a compact orientable surface [13, 1]; in this case the complex structures are\ninduced by those on the surface.\nLet (V, \u03c9) be a symplectic vector space and J, a compatible linear complex structure on V . The qunatum\nHilbert space is a representation of Heisenberg algebra, generated by tensor powers of V subject to the\ncanonical commutation relation. The existence of projective flatness is related to the celebrated Stonevon Neumann theorem [18], which asserts that the irreducible representation of the Heisenberg algebra is\nunique up to a unitary equivalence. Moreover, by Schur's lemma, any two unitary equivalences between two\nirreducible representations have to differ only by a phase. So between the fibres over two linear complex\n\u2217 Department\n\nof Mathematics, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China (current address)\nand Department of Mathematics, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309-0395, USA\nEmail address: swu@maths.hku.hk\n\n1\n\n\fstructures in the bundle of Hilbert spaces, there is a unitary identification which is unique up to a phase.\nThis is the hallmark of projectively flat bundles.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to establish a similar structure of projective flatness in the quantisation\nof fermions. The phase space of a linear fermionic system is a Euclidean space (V, g) and quantisation means\nfinding an irreducible representation of the Clifford algebra, which is the fermionic analog of the Heisenberg\nalgebra. (See [16, 7] for formal similarities between the two algebras.) Such a representation is the spinor\nrepresentation, and just like the bosonic case, it is unique (when dim V is even) or nearly unique (when\ndim V is odd) [5]. In the construction of the spinor representation, one needs to choose a compatible complex\nstructure (see for example [3], \u00a73.2), which is the fermionic counterpart of polarisation. We therefore expect\na projectively flat bundle (of spinor representations) over space of such complex structures.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. In \u00a72, we review the pre-quantisation and quantisation of\nbosonic systems whose phase spaces are symplectic vector spaces. We then recall the natural connection on\nthe bundle of Hilbert spaces and give a straightforward proof of its projective flatness [1]. The connection\nbecomes flat after metaplectic correction is included [29, 15]. We present, in a coordinate-free way, the\nresults in [15] on the parallel transport in the bundle of Hilbert spaces along geodesics in the base space.\nFinally, when there is a group acting symplectically on the vector space, we decompose the bundle of Hilbert\nspaces into a direct sum of projectively flat sub-bundles and identify the invariant part as the bundle from\nquantising the symplectic quotient. \u00a73 is devoted to the quantisation of fermions when the phase space is\nan even-dimensional Euclidean space. We discuss the pre-quantisation and quantisation of fermions using\ncalculus of fermionic variables. We then define a natural connection on the bundle of Hilbert spaces and show\nthat it is projectively flat. This identifies, up to a phase, constructions of the spinor representation under\nvarious polarisations. We introduce the concept of metaplectic correction for fermions and show that the\nbundle of corrected Hilbert spaces is naturally flat. We then show that the parallel transport in the bundle\nof Hilbert spaces along a geodesic is the rescaled projection or the Bogoliubov transformation provided the\ngeodesic lies within the complement of a cut locus. The decomposition of the bundle of Hilbert spaces when\nthere is a symmetry is also studied. In \u00a74, we conclude by highlighting the similarities and differences in the\nquantisation of bosons and fermions. In Appendix A, we consider the geometry of the spaces of complex\nstructures compatible to a symplectic or Euclidean structure, which are classical Hermitian symmetric spaces\n[21, 14]. We describe cut locus in the space of polarisations of a fermionic system. Appendix B is on the\ncalculus of fermionic variables. We describe fermionic coherent states and the fermionic analog of Bergman\nkernel. In Appendix C, we collect some facts on real and quaternionic representations and on complex\nstructures invariant under a representation.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nQuantisation of bosonic systems\nPre-quantisation and quantisation\n\nLet (V, \u03c9) be a symplectic vector space of\u221a\ndimension 2n. A pre-quantum line bundle l over V is a line bundle\nwith a connection whose curvature is \u03c9/ \u22121 . The pre-quantum Hilbert space is H0 = L2 (V, l), the space\nof L2 -sections of l with respect to the symplectic volume form \u03b5\u03c9 = \u03c9 \u2227n /n! or \u03b5\u0303\u03c9 = \u03b5\u03c9 /(2\u03c0)n on V . The\ncovariant derivative \u2207x along a constant vector field on V parallel\n\u221a to x \u2208 V is a skew-self-adjoint operator on\nH0 and satisfies the commutation relation [\u2207x , \u2207y ] = \u03c9(x, y)/ \u22121 for any x, y \u2208 V . As V is contractible,\nl is topologically trivial and is unique up to an isomorphism. We can choose a trivialisation of l identifying\nH0 with L2 (V, C) such that\n\u221a\n\u2207x = Lx + 12 \u22121 \u03b9x \u03c9, x \u2208 V.\nHere \u03b9x \u03c9 \u2208 V \u2217 is regarded as a linear function on V multiplying on the sections of l or on L2 (V, C). For any\n\u03b1 \u2208 V \u2217 , the corresponding pre-quantum operator acting on H0 is\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u0302 = \u22121 \u2207\u03bd \u22121 (\u03b1) + \u03b1 = \u22121 L\u03bd \u22121 (\u03b1) + 12 \u03b1.\n\nThese operators are self-adjoint on H0 and satisfy Heisenberg's canonical commutation relation [\u03b1\u0302, \u03b2\u0302] =\n\u221a\n\u22121 \u03c9 \u22121 (\u03b1, \u03b2), where \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 V \u2217 .\nConsider the space J\u03c9 of compatible complex structures on (V, \u03c9). (We refer the reader to \u00a7A.1-2 for\nnotations and results on complex structures.) For each J \u2208 J\u03c9 , the complex subspaces VJ1,0 , VJ0,1 of V C are\nLagrangian with respect to \u03c9 and they determine a (linear) complex polarisation of (V, \u03c9). The quantum\nHilbert space associated to J is\nHJ = {\u03c8 \u2208 H0 | \u2207x \u03c8 = 0, \u2200x \u2208 VJ0,1 }.\n2\n\n\fSo a vector \u03c8 \u2208 HJ is a holomorphic L2 -section of l. The compatibility condition on J guarantees that the\nspace HJ is non-empty; in fact, it is infinite dimensional. Note that for any J \u2208 J\u03c9 , HJ is a subspace of H0 .\nThus we have a bundle of quantum Hilbert spaces H \u2192 J\u03c9 whose fibre over J \u2208 J\u03c9 is HJ .\nThe following results are well known.\nProposition 2.1 1. Any \u03c8 \u2208 HJ is of the form\n\n1\n\n\u03c8 = e\u2212 4 qJ \u03c6\nfor a unique J-holomorphic function \u03c6 on V , where qJ \u2208 \u03c9(*, J*) \u2208 Sym2 (V \u2217 ) is regarded as a quadratic\nfunction on V .\n1\n2. If \u03c6 is a J-holomorphic function on V , then \u03c8 = e\u2212 4 qJ \u03c6 is in HJ if and only if its norm\n\u00131/2\n\u0012Z\n2\n\u2212 21 qJ\n|\u03c6| \u03b5\u0303\u03c9\ne\nV\n\n\u2212 12 qJ\n\nweighted by e\nis finite, in which case it is equal to the norm of \u03c8 \u2208 H0 .\n3. For any \u03b1 \u2208 V \u2217 , \u03b1\u0302 preserves HJ and is self-adjoint on HJ . It acts on \u03c6 by\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u0302 : \u03c6 7\u2192 \u22121 L\u03bd \u22121 (\u03b10,1 ) \u03c6 + \u03b11,0 \u03c6.\nIf xi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) are the complex coordinates on VJ1,0 with respect to a basis {ei }i=1,...,n , then the\ncovariant derivative along \u0113j\u0304 is \u2207j\u0304 = \u2202\u2202x\u0304j\u0304 + 21 qij\u0304 xi , where qij\u0304 = qJ (ei , \u0113j\u0304 ). A section \u03c8 \u2208 HJ can be\nidentified as a function of the form\n\u03c8(x) = \u03c6(x) exp[\u2212 12 qij\u0304 xi x\u0304j\u0304 ],\nwhere \u03c6(x) is a holomorphic function in x = (x1 , * * * , xn ) \u2208 Cn .\n\n2.2\n\nProjectively flat connection and metaplectic correction\n\nThe vector bundle H \u2192 J\u03c9 of quantum Hilbert spaces is a sub-bundle of the product bundle J\u03c9 \u00d7 H0 \u2192 J\u03c9\nof pre-quantum Hilbert spaces. The trivial connection on the latter induces a natural connection on H by\northogonal projection. In [1], it was shown that the connection on H is projectively flat. For completeness\nand for comparison with the fermionic case (\u00a73.2), we give a simple derivation of this result.\nWe first study the effect of the variation \u03b4J on HJ . We choose a basis {ei }1\u2264i\u2264n of VJ1,0 . Suppose \u03c8 \u2208 HJ ,\ni.e., \u2207k\u0304 \u03c8 = 0 (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n). As J changes to J + \u03b4J, the infinitesimal parallel transport \u03c8 + \u03b4\u03c8 \u2208 HJ+\u03b4J\nof \u03c8 \u2208 HJ is the orthogonal projection of \u03c8 on HJ+\u03b4J . Thus we have two conditions: \u03b4\u03c8 \u22a5 HJ , i.e.,\n\u03b4\u03c8 \u22a5 ker \u2207\u012b for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and \u03c8 + \u03b4\u03c8 \u2208 HJ+\u03b4J , or\n\u2207\u0113\u012b +\u03b4\u0113\u012b (\u03c8 + \u03b4\u03c8) = 0,\nwhere \u03b4\u0113\u012b = (\u03b4 P\u0304 )\u012b j ej (see \u00a7A.2).

Let (V, \u03c9) be a symplectic vector space. The space (J\u03c9 , \u03b7\u03c9 ) of compatible\ncomplex structures is non-positively curved and there is a unique geodesic connecting any two points.

We want to study the parallel transport UJH1 J0 and UJ\u01241 J0 in\nthe bundles H and \u0124, respectively, along the geodesic from J0 to J1 . A related notion is the orthogonal\nprojection PJ1 J0 from HJ0 to HJ1 in H0 .\nTheorem 2.3 ([15]) Let J0 , J1 \u2208 J\u03c9 and let \u03b3 = {Jt }0\u2264t\u22641 be the (unique) geodesic from J0 to J1 , t being\nproportional to the arc-length parameter.

The action of Sp(V, \u03c9) on J\u03c9 can be lifted to H,\npreserving the projectively flat connection.\n\u221a It can be lifted to an action of the metaplectic group Mp(V, \u03c9),\nwhich is a double cover of Sp(V, \u03c9), on K and hence on \u0124. The lifted action preserves the flat connection.\nLet K be a compact Lie group with Lie algebra k. Suppose there is a representation of K on V preserving\n\u03c9. Then it also acts on the bundles H and \u0124 preserving the connections. Over the fixed-point set (J\u03c9 )K ,\nthe group K acts on the fibres of H. Each fibre splits orthogonally into a direct sum of subspaces of various\nrepresentation types. Since K preserves the connection, the restriction of the bundle H to (J\u03c9 )K , together\nwith the projectively flat connection, splits into sub-bundles with fibre-wise K-actions. The sub-bundle HK\non which K acts trivially is related to the quantisation of the symplectic quotient.\n\n5\n\n\fThe action of K on V is Hamiltonian with a moment map \u03bcK : V \u2192 k\u2217 given by\nh\u03bcK (x), Ai =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03c9(x, Ax),\n\nx \u2208 V, A \u2208 k.\n\nK\nThe symplectic quotient V //K = \u03bc\u22121\nK (0)/K is a stratified symplectic space [23]. Choosing J \u2208 (J\u03c9 ) , the\nC\nC\naction of K extends to that of K . Let \u03c0 : V \u2192 V /K be the quotient map. With the above moment map,\nevery point in V is semi-stable, i.e., V ss = V (see Example 2.3 of [22]). The quotient V /K C = V //K is also\na stratified analytic space; a function f on an open set U \u2282 V /K C is analytic if \u03c0 \u2217 f is so on \u03c0 \u22121 (U ). On\nthe singular space V //K, this analytic structure replaces the notion of polarisation. The sheaf of invariant\nsections \u03c0\u2217K l on V /K C defined by O(\u03c0\u2217K l)(U ) = \u0393 (\u03c0 \u22121 (U ), O(l))K plays the role of a pre-quantum line\nbundle. We have (cf. Proposition 2.14 and Theorem 2.18 of [22])\n\n\u0393 (V //K, O(\u03c0\u2217K l)) \u223c\n= \u0393 (V, O(l))K .\nRestricting to the L2 -subspaces, we can identify (HJ )K with the quantum Hilbert space arising from the\nquantisation of V //K with a complex structure induced from J.\nWe have a projectively flat bundle HK \u2192 (J\u03c9 )K whose fibres are quantum Hilbert spaces of V //K with\ncomplex structures from (J\u03c9 )K . The connection is unitary if the inner product in the fibres (HJ )K is the\nrestriction of that in HJ . This is the case, for example, in the quantisation of Chern-Simons gauge theory [1].\nThe inner product on (HJ )K from quantisation of V //K is usually different. In [12], it was shown that for a\ncompact symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian group action and when metaplectic correction is included,\nthe two inner products agree in the semi-classical limit.\nUnless the moment map \u03bcK is proper, the symplectic quotient V //K is non-compact and the quantum\nHilbert space (HJ )K is expected to be infinite dimensional. When \u03bcK is proper however, the base space of\nthe bundle HK \u2192 (J\u03c9 )K is a point.\nProposition 2.6 If \u03bcK : V \u2192 k\u2217 is proper, then (J\u03c9 )K = {J0 }.\nProof: If (J\u03c9 )K 6= {J0 }, then by Proposition C.4.1, there is a non-zero K-invariant complex subspace (V \u2032 , J0 )\nof (V, J0 ) and a K-invariant real structure R on V \u2032 such that \u03c9(Rx, Ry) = \u2212\u03c9(x, y) for all x, y \u2208 V \u2032 . For\nany A \u2208 k, x \u2208 V \u2032 , we have\nh\u03bcK (Rx), Ai =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03c9(Rx, ARx) =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03c9(Rx, RAx) = \u2212 21 \u03c9(x, Ax) = \u2212h\u03bcK (x), Ai.\n\nTherefore \u03bcK = 0 on V0\u2032 = (V \u2032 )R and hence \u03bcK is not proper.\n\n3\n3.1\n\n\u0003\n\nQuantisation of fermionic systems\nPre-quantisation and quantisation\n\nWe consider pre-quantisation [17] and quantisation [28] of linear fermionic systems. The phase space is given\nby a finite-dimensional real vector space V equipped with a Euclidean inner product g. More precisely, it\nis a fermionic copy \u03a0V of V (see \u00a7B.1). The pre-quantum line bundle does not exists in the usual sense,\nbut its \"sections\" and the operators acting onVthem do. Motivated by the bosonic case (\u00a72.1), we take the\npre-quantum Hilbert space H0 of fermions as \u2022 (V C )\u2217 , the space of \"functions\" on \u03a0V .

It is\n\u2022 \u2217\ncrucial in achieving projective flatness for the bundle H \u2192 Jg (\u00a73.2), as the bundle\nV \u2192 Jg without the\nfermionic Gaussian factor is not projectively flat.\nThe results in this section can be explained using \"fermionic coordinates\". We refer the reader to \u00a7B.2\nwhere this is done.\n\n3.2\n\nProjectively flat connection and metaplectic correction\n\nWe study the geometry of the bundle H \u2192 Jg of Hilbert spaces of the fermionic system (V, g). Following\n\u00a72.2, we define a connection on H by orthogonal projection of the trivial connection on the product bundle\nJg \u00d7 H0 \u2192 Jg . We now show that this connection is also projectively flat.\nAlong a variation \u03b4J of J \u2208 Jg , \u03c8 \u2208 HJ changes to \u03c8 + \u03b4\u03c8 \u2208 HJ+\u03b4J by parallel transport. Since \u03c8 + \u03b4\u03c8\nis the (infinitesimal) orthogonal projection of \u03c8 to HJ+\u03b4J , we have, as in \u00a72.2, \u03b4\u03c8 \u22a5 HJ and\n\u2207\u012b (\u03b4\u03c8) = \u2212(\u03b4 P\u0304 )\u012b j \u2207j \u03c8 = (\u03b4P )\u012b j \u2207j \u03c8.\nThe (unique) solution that satisfies the above two conditions is\n\u03b4\u03c8 = \u2212 12 \u2207i (\u03b4P )ij \u2207j \u03c8 = \u2212 21 (\u03b4P )ij \u2207i \u2207j \u03c8.\nFirst, this \u03b4\u03c8 is orthogonal to HJ as \u2207\u012b is the formal adjoint of \u2207i . Second, as \u2207\u012b \u03c8 = 0, (\u03b4P )ij = \u2212(\u03b4P )ji\nand {\u2207\u012b , \u2207j } = \u2212g\u012bj , we get\n\u2207k\u0304 (\u03b4\u03c8) = \u2212 21 (\u03b4P )ij [\u2207k\u0304 , \u2207i \u2207j ]\u03c8 = \u2212 21 (\u03b4P )ij ({\u2207k\u0304 , \u2207i }\u2207j \u2212 \u2207i {\u2207k\u0304 , \u2207j })\u03c8\n= gk\u0304i (\u03b4P )ij \u2207j \u03c8 = (\u03b4P )k\u0304j \u2207j \u03c8.\n\nThe connection AH on H is determined by (\u03b4 + AH )\u03c8 = 0 and thus AH =\ncalculations in \u00a72.2, we get\n\n1\n2\n\n(\u03b4P )ij \u2207i \u2207j .

Recall the line bundle K\u22121 = det V \u2192 Jg whose fibre\nV\nover J is KJ\u22121 = n VJ1,0 . We claim that c1 (K) is even. This can be seen from the holonomy of\u221athe bundle\nH with curvature FH = \u2212 21 FK idH . Since Jg is simply connected, there is a unique line bundle K\u22121 \u2192 Jg\n\u221a\n\u221a\nsuch that ( K\u22121 )\u22972 = K\u22121 .

Since the curvatures of H and K\u22121\ncancel, the bundle \u0124 \u2192 J is canonically flat. The flatness of the bundle indicates that for the fermionic\nsystem whose phase space is a linear space, quantisation is independent of the choice of polarisations.

We recall from \u00a7A.2 that the pseudo-K\u00e4hler form \u03c3 restricts to \u03c3\u03c9 on J\u03c9 but to \u2212\u03c3g\non Jg . Consequently, for both bosonic and fermionic systems, the line bundle of half-forms has a negative\nfirst Chern form on the space of polarisations.\nWe summarise the results in the following\nTheorem 3.2 Consider the quantisation of a fermionic system whose phase space is given by a finite dimensional Euclidean vector space (V, g).\n\u221a\n1.

It can be lifted to an action of the spin group Spin(V, g), which is a double cover of SO(V, g),\non K\u22121 and hence on \u0124. The lifted action preserves the flat connection.\nSuppose K is a compact Lie group with Lie algebra k acting on (V, g) by an orthogonal representation.\nThen it also acts on the bundles H and \u0124 preserving the connections. Over the fixed-point set (Jg )K ,\nthe group K acts on the fibres of H. Each fibre splits orthogonally into a direct sum of subspaces of\nvarious representation-types of K. Since K preserves the connection, the restriction of the bundle H to\n(Jg )K together with the projectively flat connection splits into sub-bundles on which K acts fibre-wisely. In\nparticular, we have a projectively flat sub-bundle HK \u2192 (Jg )K on which K acts trivially on the fibres.\nWe now study the fermionic reduced phase space \u03a0V //K and its quantisation. The action of the Lie\nalgebra k yields Hamiltonian \"vector fields\" on \u03a0V [17]. The moment map \u03bcK is given by, for any A \u2208 k,\nV2 \u2217\nV or\nh\u03bcK , Ai = 21 g(A*, *) \u2208\nh\u03bcK (\u03b8), Ai =\n\n1\n2\n\ng(A\u03b8, \u03b8),\n\n\u03b8 \u2208 \u03a0V, A \u2208 k\n\nusing fermionic variables. Following the construction of the usualVsymplectic quotients, the fermionic ana\u2022\nlogue \u03a0V //K should be the \"spec\" of the non-commutative ring ( (V \u2217 )C /h\u03bcK i)K , where h\u03bcK i is the ideal\ngenerated by h\u03bcK , Ai for all A \u2208 k. The \"space\" \u03a0V //K is not usually a graded manifold in the sense of [17];\nit would be so if 0 were a regular value of \u03bcK [2]. So fermionic symplectic quotients are interesting examples\nof supermanifolds with curved fermionic coordinates. Consider the example V = R2n with K = S 1 acting\nby weights \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr 6= 0, \u03bbr+1 = * * * = \u03bbn = 0. Then the \"coordinate ring\" of \u03a0R2n //S 1 is generated by\n1, \u03b81 \u03b82 , . . . , \u03b82r\u22121 \u03b82r , \u03b82r+1 , . . . , \u03b82n subject to a relation \u03bb1 \u03b81 \u03b82 + * * * + \u03bbr \u03b82r\u22121 \u03b82r = 0. Here \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b82n are\nthe fermionic coordinates on \u03a0R2n . When r = 1, the above ring is the exterior algebra on \u03b83 , . . . , \u03b82n and\nthus \u03a0R2n //S 1 \u223c\n= \u03a0R2n\u22122 .\nProposition 3.6 If dim(Jg )K > 0, then there is a non-zero K-invariant complex subspace (V \u2032 , J0 ) of (V, J0 )\nwith a K-invariant quaternionic structure such that the restriction of \u03bcK to \u03a0V \u2032 is invariant under the scalar\nmultiplication by quaternions of unit norm.\nProof: By Proposition C.4.2, there is a non-zero K-invariant complex subspace (V \u2032 , J0 ) of (V, J0 ) and a\nK-invariant quaternionic structure Q on V \u2032 such that g(Q*, Q*) = g(*, *) on V \u2032 . For any A \u2208 k, we have\nh\u03bcK (Q\u03b8), Ai =\n\n1\n2\n\ng(Q\u03b8, AQ\u03b8) =\n\n1\n2\n\ng(Q\u03b8, QA\u03b8) =\n\n1\n2\n\ng(\u03b8, A\u03b8) = h\u03bcK (\u03b8), Ai,\n\nwhere \u03b8 \u2208 \u03a0V \u2032 . The result then follows easily from g(J0 *, J0 *) = g(*, *) and QJ0 = \u2212J0 Q.\n\n4\n\n\u0003\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe end with a comparison of the quantisation of bosons and fermions. As explained in \u00a71, the existence of\nprojectively flat connection is due largely to the fact that the irreducible representation of the operator algebra\n(Heisenberg algebra for bosons and Clifford algebra for fermions) is unique up to unitary equivalence. This\nenables us to identify, up to a phase, states in Hilbert spaces constructed from various linear polarisations.\nMoreover, the geometric structure of the bundle of Hilbert spaces and results on parallel transport are rather\nsimilar in the bosonic and fermionic cases.\nWe note however some conceptual differences. For bosons, the positivity condition is on the polarisation\nwhereas for fermions, it is on the Euclidean structure g. Indeed, the unitarity of the representation of the\nHeisenberg algebra is not sensitive to the sign of \u03c9, whereas for fermions, the positivity condition on g is\nthe requirement for unitarity [25]. On the other hand, the positivity condition on polarisation for bosons\nguarantees the existence of holomorphic sections rather than elements in higher cohomology groups. For\nfermions, the cohomology is always at the zeroth degree; this reflects the Dirac sea picture in physics.\nMathematically, the spaces of allowed polarisations are Hermitian symmetric spaces in both cases. For\nbosons, the space non-compact, non-positively curved. Though it is contractible, the difficulty occurs at the\nboundary at infinity, where the limit of parallel transport should be carefully taken [15]. For fermions, the\nspace of polarisation is compact, non-negatively curved. Though it has no boundary, interesting phenomena\n(non-uniqueness of geodesics, degeneracy of the half-form pairing) because of cut locus (\u00a7A.3 and \u00a73.3).\nFurthermore, the half-form bundles in metaplectic correction are of opposite powers of the canonical bundle\n\n11\n\n\fin the two cases in order to cancel the curvature of the projectively flat connection. We hope that these\nobservations are useful to future research on the quantisation of more general symplectic or graded symplectic\nmanifolds.\n\nAppendix\nA\nA.1\n\nGeometry of the space of complex structures\nComplex structures on a vector space\n\nLet V be a real vector space of dimension 2n. Consider the set J of complex structures on V compatible\n1,0\n0,1\n1,0\n0,1\nC\nwith a given orientation on V . For each J \u2208 J, there is a decomposition\n\u221aV = VJ \u2295 VJ , where VJ , VJ\nare the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic subspaces, on which J = \u00b1 \u22121 , respectively. Similarly, there is\na decomposition (V \u2217 )C = (VJ1,0 )\u2217 \u2295 (VJ0,1 )\u2217 . For x \u2208 V , \u03b1 \u2208 V \u2217 , we write, accordingly,\n0,1\nx = x1,0\nJ + xJ ,\n\n0,1\n\u03b1 = \u03b11,0\nJ + \u03b1J .\n\nThe space J is a connected smooth manifold of real dimension 2n2 . At any J0 \u2208 J, the tangent space of J is\n0,1\n1,0\n0,1\n1,0\nT J0 J \u223c\n= HomC (VJ0 , VJ0 ). Moreover, a dense open subset of J can be parametrised by Z \u2208 HomC (VJ0 , VJ0 ):\n1,0\n1,0\nfor any such Z, the corresponding subspace VJ is the graph of Z, that is, VJ consists of the vectors of\n\u0001\nx\nunder the decomposition V C = VJ1,0\nthe form Zx\n\u2295 VJ0,1\n, where x \u2208 VJ1,0\n. These open sets (for various\n0\n0\n0\nJ0 ) have complex coordinates and form an open cover of J. This defines a complex structure on J. For a\nfixed J0 \u2208 J, the complement of the open set consists of J \u2208 J such that VJ1,0 \u2229 VJ0,1\n6= {0}, which happens\n0\n0,1\n)\ncorresponds\nto a complex\n,\nV\nwhen J + J0 is not invertible. On the other hand, not every Z \u2208 HomC (VJ1,0\nJ0\n0\n1,0\n0,1\n1,0\nstructure. If it does, then the condition VJ \u2229 VJ = {0} implies that 1 \u2212 Z\u0304Z \u2208 End(VJ0 ) is invertible.\nAn element Z that violates this condition is on the \"boundary\" of J. Finally, the projection onto VJ1,0 along\n\u221a\nVJ0,1 is PJ = 12 (1 \u2212 \u22121 J). Given J0 , on the dense set where J can be parametrised by Z, the projection is\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\nPJ =\n(1 \u2212 Z\u0304Z)\u22121 (1, \u2212Z\u0304).\nZ\nSuppose \u03b4J is an infinitesimal\nvariation of J \u2208 J. (The symbol \u03b4 can be interpreted as the differential on\n\u221a\nJ.) Since the change \u03b4P = \u2212 \u22121\n\u03b4J\nof P = PJ anti-commutes with J, it is off-diagonal with respect to the\n2\n1,0\n0,1\n1,0\nC\ndecomposition V = VJ \u2295VJ . The new holomorphic subspace VJ+\u03b4J\nis the graph of the HomC (VJ1,0 , VJ0,1 )component of \u03b4P . Since P + P\u0304 = idV , we have \u03b4 P\u0304 = \u2212\u03b4P .\nWe consider the vector bundle V \u2192 J whose fibre over J \u2208 J is VJ1,0 . This is a sub-bundle of the product\nbundle J \u00d7 V C and has a connection defined by the projection PJ . This connection on V is AV = \u2212(\u03b4PJ )PJ\nand its curvature is\nFV = PJ \u03b4PJ \u2227 \u03b4PJ PJ = \u2212 41 PJ \u03b4J \u2227 \u03b4J PJ\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n=\u2212\n(1 \u2212 Z\u0304Z)\u22121 \u03b4 Z\u0304 \u2227 (1 \u2212 Z Z\u0304)\u22121 \u03b4Z(1 \u2212 Z\u0304Z)\u22121 (1, \u2212Z\u0304).\nZ\nVn\nThe curvature of the line bundle det V =\nV \u2192 J is the 2-form\n\nFdetV = tr(PJ \u03b4PJ \u2227 \u03b4PJ PJ ) = tr((1 \u2212 Z Z\u0304)\u22121 \u03b4Z \u2227 (1 \u2212 Z\u0304Z)\u22121 \u03b4 Z\u0304).\n\n(All expressions in terms of Z are valid onVa dense open set of J only.) The canonical line bundle over V is\nn\nthe product bundle V \u00d7 KJ , where KJ =\n(VJ1,0 )\u2217 . We have a line bundle K \u2192 J whose fibre over J \u2208 J\n\u2217\nis KJ . In fact, K = (detV) and its curvature is FK = \u2212FdetV .\nThe space J has a transitive action of GL+ (V ), the identity component of GL(V ) \u223c\n= GL(2n, R) preserving\nthe orientation on V . At J0 \u2208 J, the isotropy subgroup GL(V, J0 ) \u223c\n= GL(n, C) consists of elements in GL(V )\nthat commutes with J0 . Therefore J can be identified as the homogeneous space GL+ (V )/ GL(V, J0 ). The\nLie algebra of GL+ (V ) has the decomposition gl(V ) = gl(V, J0 ) \u2295 m, where gl(V, J0 ), m are the subspaces in\ngl(V ) of elements that commute, anti-commute with J0 , respectively. Since m is invariant under the adjoint\n\n12\n\n\faction of GL(V, J0 ) and since [m, m] \u2282 gl(V, J0 ), GL+ (V )/ GL(V, J0 ) is a reductive symmetric space.

As J is reductive, a geodesic in J is of the form t 7\u2192 [gt ] with gt = g0 etM (see [19]), where\ng0 \u2208 GL+ (V ), M \u2208 m and [g] denotes the coset in GL+ (V )/ GL(V, J0 ) \u223c\n= J represented by g \u2208 GL+ (V ).\nThe parameter t \u2208 R is proportional to the arc-length on the geodesic.\n\u221a\nProposition A.1 For any t, Jt/2 / \u22121 is the parallel transport in V along the geodesic from J0 to Jt .\nProof: Since the geodesic starts from J0 , we have g0 = 1, hence gt gt\u2032 = gt+t\u2032 and gt\u22121 = g\u2212t .

So the restriction \u03c3\u03c9 of \u03c3 to J\u03c9 is a K\u00e4hler form.\nGiven J0 \u2208 J\u03c9 , the whole space J\u03c9 can be parametrised by Z \u2208 HomC (VJ1,0\n, VJ0,1\n).

So J\u03c9 \u223c\n= Sp(V, \u03c9)/ U(V, h0 ). It can be identified\nholomorphically with a bounded Hermitian symmetric domain or with the Siegel upper-half space; the two\nare related by a Cayley transform.\nIf instead there is a Euclidean inner product g on V , let Jg be the set of complex structures J that is\ncompatible with g, i.e., g(J*, J*) = g(*, *), and the orientation on V . There is an isomorphism \u03bd = \u03bdg : V \u2192 V \u2217\ndefined by x \u2208 V 7\u2192 \u03b9x g \u2208 V \u2217 and an involution s = sg : J 7\u2192 \u03bd \u22121 \u25e6 TJ \u25e6 \u03bd on J. The fixed-point set is Js = Jg .\nAs s is an isometry, Jg is totally geodesic in J as in the symplectic case. Jg is K\u00e4hler since the restriction \u03b7g\nof \u2212\u03b7 to Jg is positive definite; the restriction \u03c3g of \u2212\u03c3 to Jg is the K\u00e4hler form. Given J0 \u2208 Jg , we denote\n)\u2217 the restriction of \u03bd : V C \u2192 (V \u2217 )C .

The space Jg \u223c\n=\nsymmetric space. Finally, if in addition there is a symplectic form \u03c9 on V such that \u03c9(*, J0 *) is proportional\nto g, then J\u03c9 and Jg intersects at J0 orthogonally with respect to the pseudo-K\u00e4hler metric \u03b7 on J.\n\n13\n\n\fWe describe the results using tensor indices.

If (V, g) is a Euclidean space instead, then g\u012bj = g(\u0113\u012b , ej ) = gj \u012b .

The\ncollection of such points form the first conjugate locus of o. The cut point of o along a geodesic \u03b3 from o is\nthe point p such that \u03b3 is length-minimising between o and p but fails to be so beyond p. There is an open\ncell B in To M such that the exponential map is a diffeomorphism from B onto a (connected) open subset of\nM whose compliment is the cut locus of o. The image of the closure B\u0304 under the exponential map is M .\nWhile the structure of cut loci or first conjugate loci for general Riemannian manifolds is quite complicated\n(see for example [24]), there is a Lie-theoretical description for compact Riemannian symmetric spaces. For\nsimply connected symmetric spaces (such as the space Jg above), the cut locus and first conjugate locus\ncoincide [6], though this fails to be true in general [20]. For example, the cut and first conjugate loci of\nGrassmannian manifolds are known explicitly in terms of Schubert varieties [27] (see however Remark 4.3\nof [20]).

Then the fermionic Gaussian factor becomes e 4 \u031fJ (\u03b80 ) .\n\n17\n\n\fC\nC.1\n\nInvariant real, complex and quaternionic structures\nRepresentations of real and quaternionic types\n\nLet W be a finite-dimensional complex vector space. An operator C : W \u2192 W is conjugate linear if C is\nreal linear and C(ax) = \u0101(Cx) for all a \u2208 C, x \u2208 W . Such operators are in HomC (W, W\u0304 ), where W\u0304 the\ncomplex vector space which is equal to W as an Abelian group but whose scalar multiplication is given by\n(a, x) \u2208 C\u00d7W 7\u2192 \u0101x \u2208 W . A real structure on W is a conjugate-linear operator R on W such that R2 = idW .\nSuch an R determines a real vector space W0 = W R \u2282 W fixed by R and W \u223c\n= (W0 )C as complex vector\nspaces. A quaternionic structure on W is a conjugate-linear operator Q on W such that Q2 = \u2212 idW . This\nmakes W a quaternionic vector space whith the scalar multiplication (a + bj, x) \u2208 H \u00d7 W 7\u2192 ax + bQx \u2208 W\n(where a, b \u2208 C).\nSuppose a group K acts on W by a complex representation. The representation is of real type if there is\na K-invariant real structure on W . Such a representation is the complexification of a real representation of\nK on W0 . The representation is of quaternionic type if there is a K-invariant quaternionic structure on W .\nSuch a representation is quaternionic-linear with the above scalar multiplication by H. We refer the reader\nto [4] for the standard properties of real- and quaternionic-type representations. We collect here some more\nresults that will be used in \u00a7C.2.\nUnless stated otherwise, we assume from now on that K is a finite group or a compact Lie group. By\naveraging over K, there is a K-invariant Hermitian form h : W \u00d7 W\u0304 \u2192 C on W . Our convention of Hermitian\nforms on W is that they are complex linear in the first variable but conjugate linear in the second. (However,\nwe took the opposite convention of physicists for pre-quantum or quantum Hilbert spaces.)\nLemma C.1 Consider a representation of K on a complex vector space W . Then\n1. the representation is of real (quaternionic, respectively) type if and only if there is a non-degenerate Kinvariant symmetric (skew-symmetric, respectively) bilinear form on W ;\n2. there is a non-zero sub-representation W \u2032 \u2282 W of real (quaternionic, respectively) type if and only if there\nis a non-zero K-invariant symmetric (skew-symmetric, respectively) bilinear form on W .\nProof: Part 1 is well known; see for example Proposition II.6.4 in [4] or the proof of Lemma C.2 below. Part 2\nfollows immediately by taking W \u2032 as the orthogonal complement (with respect to a K-invariant Hermitian\nform) of the kernel of the bilinear form.\n\u0003\nLemma C.2 Under the same conditions as in Lemma C.1, suppose h is a K-invariant Hermitian form\non W . If the representation of K on W is of real (quaternionic, respectively) type, then there is a Kinvariant real structure R (quaternionic structure Q, respectively) on W such that h(Rx, Ry) = h(y, x)\n( h(Qx, Qy) = h(y, x), respectively) for all x, y \u2208 W .\n\nProof: Suppose C0 is a K-invariant real (quaternionic, respectively) structure on W . Then C02 = \u01eb idW , where\n\u01eb = \u00b11, respectively. Consider the complex bilinear form \u03b2 on W given by \u03b2(x, y) = h(x, C0 y) + \u01eb h(y, C0 x),\nwhere x, y \u2208 W . Then \u03b2 is symmetric (skew-symmetric, respectively) when \u01eb = \u00b11. Moreover, \u03b2 is nondegenerate as \u03b2(C0 x, x) = h(x, x) + h(C0 x, C0 x) for any x \u2208 W . Following the proof of Proposition II.6.4\nin [4], we define an invertible, conjugate-linear operator C on W by \u03b2(x, y) = h(x, Cy), x, y \u2208 W . Then\nh(C 2 x, y) = \u01eb h(Cy, Cx) = h(x, C 2 y). Consequently, \u01eb C 2 is self-adjoint and positive definite with respect\nto h. The space W decomposes as a direct sum of eigenspaces of \u01eb C 2 , each of which is K-invariant since\nC 2 is so. Without loss of generality, assume that W is the eigenspace of \u01eb C 2 of a single eigenvalue \u03bb > 0.\nSince C 2 = \u01eb\u03bb idW and \u03bbh(x, y) = h(Cy, Cx) for all x, y \u2208 W , \u03bb\u22121/2 C is the desired real (quaternionic,\nrespectively) structure on W when \u01eb = \u00b11.\n\u0003\n\nThe results in Lemma C.2 can also be explained in matrix language; we do so when the representation is\nof real type. Choosing a real basis of the real subspace W0 , the Hermitian form h corresponds to a positive\ndefinite Hermitian matrix H. There is a unitary matrix U such that D = TU H \u016a is a diagonal matrix\nof positive entries. With the representation of K, U can be chosen to commute with K. Let R = U TU .\nSince RR\u0304 is the identity matrix, R defines a real structure on W . The result follows form the identity\nT\nRH R\u0304 = U DT\u016a = H\u0304.\n\nC.2\n\nComplex structures invariant under a representation\n\nIf V is a real vector space and J is a complex structure on V , we denote by (V, J) the\n\u221a complex vector space\nwhose underlying real vector space is V and on which the scalar multiplication by \u22121 is the action of J.\n18\n\n\f1,0\nClearly, (V, J) \u223c\n= VJ as complex vector spaces. Let K be a finite or a compact Lie group. A presentation\nof K on V is a complex representation on (V, J) if and only if J \u2208 J is invariant under K.\n\nProposition C.3 1. Suppose (V, \u03c9) is a symplectic vector space and J \u2208 J\u03c9 . If a representation of K\non (V, J) is of real type and preserves \u03c9, then there is a K-invariant real structure R on (V, J) such that\n\u03c9(Rx, Ry) = \u2212\u03c9(x, y) for all x, y \u2208 V .\n2. Suppose (V, g) is an oriented Euclidean vector space of even dimension and J \u2208 Jg . If a representation\nof K on (V, J) is of quaternionic type and preserves g, then there is a K-invariant quaternionic structure Q\non (V, J) such that g(Qx, Qy) = g(x, y) for all x, y \u2208 V .\n\u221a\nProof: 1. Let h(x, y) =\u221a\u03c9(x, Jy) \u2212 \u22121 \u03c9(x, y), x, y \u2208 V . Then h is a K-invariant Hermitian form, as\nh(Jx, y) = \u2212h(x, Jy) = \u22121 h(x, y). By Lemma C.2, there is a K-invariant real structure R on (V, J) (i.e.,\nRJ = \u2212JR, R2 = idV ) such\n\u221a that h(Rx, Ry) = h(y, x). This is equivalent to \u03c9(Rx, Ry) = \u2212\u03c9(x, y).\n2. Let h(x, y)\u221a= g(x, y) \u2212 \u22121 g(Jx, y), x, y \u2208 V . Then h is a K-invariant Hermitian form, as h(Jx, y) =\n\u2212h(x, Jy) = \u22121 h(x, y). By Lemma C.2, there is a K-invariant quaternionic structure Q on (V, J) (i.e.,\nQJ = \u2212JQ, Q2 = \u2212 idV ) such that h(Qx, Qy) = h(y, x). This is equivalent to g(Qx, Qy) = g(x, y).\n\u0003\n\nSince the group K acts on J\u03c9 (Jg , respectively) by isometry, the fixed-point set (J\u03c9 )K ((Jg )K , respectively)\nis a totally geodesic submanifold.\n\nProposition C.4 1. Suppose J0 \u2208 J\u03c9 is preserved by a symplectic representation of K on (V, \u03c9). Then\n1,0\nTJ0 (J\u03c9 )K \u223c\n= (Sym2 (VJ0 ))K . Moreover, the following statements are equivalent:\n(a) (J\u03c9 )K contains a point other than J0 ;\n(b) (Sym2 (VJ1,0\n))K 6= {0};\n0\n(c) there is a non-zero complex sub-representation (V \u2032 , J0 ) of (V, J0 ) of real type.\nIn this case, V \u2032 can be chosen as a symplectic subspace and there is a K-invariant real structure R on (V \u2032 , J0 )\nsuch that \u03c9(Rx, Ry) = \u2212\u03c9(x, y) for all x, y \u2208 V \u2032 .\n2. Suppose J0 \u2208 Jg is preserved by an orthogonal representation of K on (V, g). Then TJ0 (Jg )K \u223c\n=\nV\nK\n))\n.\nMoreover,\nthe\nfollowing\nstatements\nare\nequivalent:\n( 2 (VJ1,0\n0\n(a) (Jg )K is not a discrete set;\nV2\n))K 6= {0};\n(b) ( (VJ1,0\n0\n(c) there is a non-zero complex sub-representation (V \u2032 , J0 ) of (V, J0 ) of quaternionic type.\nIn this case, there is a K-invariant quaternionic structure Q on (V \u2032 , J0 ) such that g(Qx, Qy) = g(x, y) for\nall x, y \u2208 V \u2032 .\nProof: 1. The result on the tangent space follows from \u00a7A.2. Since J\u03c9 is also K-equivariantly diffeomorphic to\n), the equivalence of (a) and (b) is clear. The equivalence with (c) is a consequence of Lemma C.1.2\nSym2 (VJ1,0\n0\nand the rest follows from Proposition\nC.3.1.\nV2\nK\n))\nglobally, the latter is isomorphic to the tangent space TJ0 (Jg )K , which\n2. Although (Jg )K is not ( (VJ1,0\n0\nK\nis zero if and only if (Jg ) is a discrete set. The rest of the proof is similar to that of part 1.\n\u0003\nBy compactness, the set (Jg )K is finite if it is discrete. When K is a compact torus group, the number\nof elements in (Jg )K is equal to the Euler characteristic \u03c7(Jg ) = 2n\u22121 . (This is the quotient of the order of\nthe Weyl group of SO(2n) by that of U(n).) For example, Jg \u223c\n= S 2 when n = 2. If K = S 1 acts on C2 with\nK\nweights 1 and \u22121, then the fixed-point set in Jg is (Jg ) = {\u00b1J0 }, whose cardinal is 2 = \u03c7(S 2 ).\nAcknowledgments.
