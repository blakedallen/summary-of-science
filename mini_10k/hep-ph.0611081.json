The effect of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry over the spectrum of highly\nexcited hadrons is addressed in the framework of a microscopic chiral potential quark model\n(Generalised Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model) with a vectorial instantaneous quark kernel of a generic\nform. A heavy-light quark-antiquark bound system is considered, as an example, and the Lorentz\nnature of the effective light-quark potential is identified to be a pure Lorentz-scalar, for low-lying\nstates in the spectrum, and to become a pure spatial Lorentz vector, for highly excited states.\nConsequently, the splitting between the partners in chiral doublets is demonstrated to decrease fast\nin the upper part of the spectrum so that neighboring states of an opposite parity become almost\ndegenerate. A detailed microscopic picture of such a \"chiral symmetry restoration\" in the spectrum\nof highly excited hadrons is drawn and the corresponding scale of restoration is estimated.\n\nChiral symmetry is known to be broken spontaneously in QCD, and this phenomenon\nplays an important role for low\u2013lying hadrons. The (almost) massless chiral pion constitutes the most prominent example of chiral symmetry breaking manifestation in the\nhadronic spectrum. In the meantime, considering quite general quantum\u2013mechanical\nprinciples [1], one can argue that this manifestation should asymptotically disappear for\nhighly excited states [2]. Although this property was studied before using various effective and phenomenological approaches [3, 4, 5], the microscopic picture of such an\neffective chiral symmetry restoration in highly excited hadrons was not disclosed so far.\nIn the meantime, a model exists which meets all the requirements necessary to reproduce\nthis phenomenon [6, 7]. This is the Generalised Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (GNJL) model for\nQCD [8, 9, 10]. Indeed, the model is chirally symmetric (in the chiral limit) and is able\nto describe microscopically the phenomenon of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in the vacuum. It is intrinsically relativistic and contains confinement, so it should\nbe able to address the problem of highly excited hadrons. The model is described by the\nHamiltonian:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n\u03bba\n\u03bba\n3\n3\n\u2020\n3 \u2020\n\u2020\n~\nH = d xq (x)(\u2212i~\u03b1 \u25bd)q(x)+ d xd y q (x) q(x) V (~x\u2212~y) q (y) q(y) , (1)\n2\n2\nwhere, for the sake of simplicity, we stick to the simplest form of the Hamiltonian (1)\ncompatible with the requiremets of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. The\nstandard approach used in this kind of models is the Bogoliubov\u2013Valatin transformation\nfrom bare to dressed quarks parametrised with the help of the chiral angle \u03c6 p [10].\nThe mass\u2013gap equation which defines the profile of the chiral angle appears from the\nrequirement that the quadratic part of the normally ordered Hamiltonian (1) is diagonal,\n: H2 :\u221d b\u2020 b + d \u2020 d. Then two phases of the theory can be identified: the unbroken phase\n\n\f\u03c6p\n\n1,6\n1,4\n1,2\n1,0\n0,8\n0,6\n0,4\n0,2\n0,0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\np\nFIGURE 1. The typical profile of the chiral angle - solution to the mass\u2013gap equation\n\nwith \u03c6 p \u2261 0, and the broken phase, with the chiral angle taking the form depicted in\nFig. 1. The broken phase possesses a lower vacuum energy and is therefore the true\nvacuum state of the theory.\nEvery mesonic state in the model is described by a pair of wave functions: one\nresponsible for the time\u2013forward and the other - for the time\u2013backward motion of the\nquark\u2013antiquark pair in the meson [8, 9, 10, 11]. To make things simpler, we consider\none quark infinitely heavy, so that the heavy\u2013light meson w.f. becomes one\u2013component\nand it obeys the Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation, in momentum space, [6]\nh\ni\nd3k\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n~\n~\n~\n~\nV (~p \u2212 k) C pCk + (\u03c3 ~p)(\u03c3 k)S pSk \u03c8 (~k) = E \u03c8 (~p),\n(2)\nE p \u03c8 (~p) +\n(2\u03c0 )3\n\u0001\n\u0001\nwhere E p is the dressed\u2013quark dispersive law; C p = cos 12 \u03c02 \u2212 \u03c6 p , S p = sin 21 \u03c02 \u2212 \u03c6 p .\nThe effect of chiral symmetry restoration in highly excited hadrons can be quite naturally\nexemplified by the behavious of the splitting between the opposite\u2013parity states \u03c8 (~p)\nand \u03c8 \u2032 (~p) as the excitation number increases (in this work, we keep the radial excitation\nnumber fixed and increase the light\u2013quark angular momentum). It is easy to notice\nthat, for highly excited mesons, the mean interquark mometum is large, so that C p \u2248\nS p \u2248 \u221a12 and the resulting bound\u2013state equation becomes symmetric with respect to\n\u02c6 \u03c8 (~p). Thus these opposite\u2013parity states become\nthe substitution \u03c8 (~p) \u2192 \u03c8 \u2032 (~p) = (~\u03c3 ~p)\ndegenerate. It is easy to trace the origin of such a degeneracy. Indeed, the splitting\nbetween \u03c8 (~p) and \u03c8 \u2032 (~p) comes from the difference C2p \u2212 S2p = sin \u03c6 p , so that this is the\nlarge\u2013momentum behaviour of the chiral angle to play a decisive role for the symmetry\nrestoration - see Fig. 1. It is instructive to approach the same problem from the point\nof view of the Lorentz nature of the effective interquark interaction. Thus we perform\nFoldy counter\u2013rotation of Eq. (2) to arrive at the Dirac\u2013like equation for the light quark:\nZ\n\n1\n(~\u03b1 ~p + \u03b2 m)\u03a8(~x) +\n2\n\nZ\n\nd 3 z U (~x \u2212~z)[V (~x) +V (~z) \u2212V (~x \u2212~z)]\u03a8(~z) = E\u03a8(~x).\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe Lorentz nature of confinement in this equation follows from the matrix structure of\nU which takes the form, in momentum space,\n\u02c6 cos \u03c6 p .\nU (~p) = \u03b2 sin \u03c6 p + (~\u03b1 ~p)\n\n(4)\n\nWe conclude therefore that, for low\u2013lying states, the effective scalar interaction dominates. It is chirally nonsymmetric and thus chiral symmetry breaking manifests itself\nin this part of the spectrum (this regime was studied in detail in [12]). On the contrary,\nfor highly excited states, the effective interquark interaction (asymptotically) becomes\npurely vectorial, so that chiral symmetry is an approximate symmetry of the interaction\nand thus approximate chiral multiplets appear in the spectrum of excited states. Notice\nthat the transition between the two regimes is governed by sin \u03c6 p which is known to be\nexactly the quantity \"responsible\"' for chiral symmetry breaking in this class of models.\nBelow we exemplify our qualitative conclusions drawn above with exact calculations\nperformed for the harmonic oscillator potential case, V (r) = K03 r2 , with K0 being the\nonly dimensional parameter of the model [8, 9, 10]. For this potential, the mass\u2013gap\nequation and the bound\u2013state euqation become ordinary second\u2013order differential equations. As soon as the mass\u2013gap equation is solved,\nwe fix the value of the scale K0 by\nR\nevaluating the chiral condensate, hq\u0304qi = \u2212 \u03c032 0\u221e d p p2 sin \u03c6 p \u2248 \u2212(0.51K0)3 , and setting\nit equal to the standard value of \u2212(250MeV )3 (for future references we call this scale\nthe BCS scale, \u039bBCS = 250MeV ). This gives K0 = 490MeV . The bound\u2013state Eq. (2)\ncan be written now, in momentum space, as\n\u2212K03 u\u2032\u2032 +V (p)u = Eu,\n\nu(p)\n,\np\n\n(5)\n\n\u03ba = \u00b1 ( j + 1/2) .\n\n(6)\n\n\u02c6\n\u03c8 (~p) = \u03a9 jlm (~p)\n\nwith the effective potential\n\u0014\n\u0015\n( j + 1/2)2 \u03ba\n3 1 \u20322\nV (p) = E p + K0 \u03c6 p +\n+ 2 sin \u03c6 p ,\n4\np2\np\n\nThis allows us to extract the difference between the potentials operative for the opposite\u2013\nparity states:\n2( j + 1/2)K03\nsin \u03c6 p ,\n\u2206V = \u2212\n(7)\np2\nand which is responsible for the splitting between such states. As it was anticipated\nbefore, this potential is directly proportional to sin \u03c6 p which vanishes as p \u2192 \u221e, and so\ndoes the splitting [6]. It is instructive to compare this situation with the Salpeter equation\np\n2(l+1)K 3\n[ p2 + m2 +K03 r2 ]\u03c8 (~x) = E \u03c8 (~x) which leads to the splitting potential \u2206V = \u2212 p2 0 .\nResults of numerical calculations are plotted in the form of Regge trajectories, in Fig. 2\n(left plot) for the radial quantum number n = 0. It is clearly seen from this plot that, for\nthe full bound\u2013state equation the trajectories corresponding to the parity doublers merge\nthus reflecting the effect of chiral symmetry restoration.\nFinally, we estimate the restoration scale [6]. To this end we notice that the splitting\nin chiral doublets appears of order of the BCS scale in the lowest part of the spectrum\n\n\f14\n\n(El=j+1/2)\n\n3/2\n\n10\n\nn=0\n\n12\n\n9\n\nrest/ BCS\n\n10\n8\n\n8\n7\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n5\n0\n\n2\n1/2\n\n3/2\n\nj\n\n5/2\n\n7/2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n/\n\nBCS\n\nEcritical\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nFIGURE 2.

Right plot: the restoration scale against the splitting.\n\nand, above some scale - the restoration scale \u039brest , it is much smaller than \u039bBCS . We\nuse this as the definition of \u039brest . Then, from the right plot at Fig. 2, one can conclude\nthat \u039brest \u2248 10\u039bBCS \u2248 2.5GeV .\nTherefore we observe that the Generalised Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio model provides a\nclear microscopical pattern of chiral symmetry restoration in the spectrum of highly\nexcited hadrons. This effective asymtotic restoration happens rather fast and the model\nis able to predict a reasonable value of the restoration scale in agreement with other\nestimates found in the literature [5].\nThe research of A.N. and Yu.K. was supported by the grants RFFI-05-02-04012NNIOa, DFG-436 RUS 113/820/0-1(R), NSh-843.2006.2, by the Federal Programme\nof the Russian Ministry of Industry, Science, and Technology No. 40.052.1.1.1112, and\nby the Russian Governmental Agreement N 02.434.11.7091.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n\nL.
