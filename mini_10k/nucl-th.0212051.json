Those\nfields range from problems in basic science through many of applied nature. An example\nof the latter is the transmutation of long lived radioactive waste into shorter lived products\nusing accelerator driven systems (ADS). As well, proton-nucleus (p-A) cross section values at\nenergies to 300 MeV or more are needed not only to specify important quantities of relevance\nto proton radiation therapy [2], but also as they are key information in assessing radiation\nprotection for patients. As an example in basic science, total reaction cross sections are\nimportant ingredients to a number of problems in astrophysics. Also the integral observable of proton scattering from a given nucleus gives direct information on the neutron root\nmean square radius in nuclei [3]; a property sought in parity-violating electron scattering\nexperiments [4].\nIt would be very utilitarian if aspects of such scattering were well approximated by a\nsimple convenient functional form. Recently it has been shown [8] that, for neutron total\nreaction cross sections, such a form may exist. Herein we consider that concept further\nto reproduce the measured total reaction cross sections from proton scattering for energies\nranging from 10 MeV to 300 MeV, and from 15 nuclei ranging in mass from 9 to 238.\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nThe total reaction cross sections for proton scattering from nuclei can be expressed in\nterms of partial wave scattering (S) matrices specified at energies E \u221d k 2 , by\n\u00b1\n\nSl\u00b1 \u2261 Sl\u00b1 (k) = e2i\u03b4l\n\n(k)\n\n= \u03b7l\u00b1 (k)e2iR[\u03b4l\n\n\u00b1\n\n(k)]\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4l\u00b1 (k) are the (complex) scattering phase shifts and \u03b7l\u00b1 (k) are the moduli of the S\nmatrices. The superscript designates j = l \u00b1 1/2. Total reaction cross sections then follow\nfrom\n\u221e\nh\nh\n\u0001 io\n\u0001i\n\u03c0 Xn\n\u2212 2\n+ 2\n\u03c3R (E) = 2\n+ l 1 \u2212 \u03b7l\n(l + 1) 1 \u2212 \u03b7l\nk\nl=0\n\n\u221e\n\u03c0 X (R)\n= 2\n\u03c3 (E) .\nk l=0 l\n\n(2)\n\nDespite the successes with use of the g-folding approach to define NA optical potentials [6],\nwe note that there are discrepancies between the predictions of total reaction cross sections\nfound thereby and actual data. Those usually are due to limitations with the structure\nmodel used to describe the ground state densities of some nuclei. However, there have\nbeen so many successes with the approach [1, 5, 6, 7] that we believe the functional form\ndeveloped here on the basis of matching the values obtained with g-folding potentials are\npertinent initial guesses to start a refinement (of the parameter values) to reproduce actual\nmeasured total reaction cross sections.\nAs evident from the figures presented in a recent paper [8], the partial total reaction cross\n(R)\nsections, \u03c3l (E), can be described by the simple functional form,\nh\ni\nh\ni\n(l\u2212l0 ) \u22121\n(l\u2212l0 ) \u22122\n(l\u2212l0 )\n(R)\n\u03c3l (E) = (2l + 1) 1 + e a\n+ \u01eb(2l0 + 1)e a 1 + e a\n(3)\n2\n\n\fwith l0 (E, A), a(E, A), and \u01eb(E, A) varying smoothly with energy and mass.\nThe summation giving the total reaction cross section can be limited to a value lmax and\nthe associated form tends appropriately to the known high energy limit. With increasing\nenergy, lmax becomes so large that the exponential fall of the functional form, Eq. 3, can be\napproximated as a straight vertical line (l0 = lmax ). In that case, the total reaction cross\nsection equates to the area of a triangle, and\n\u03c3R \u21d2\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0 2\nlmax (2lmax + 1) \u2248 2 lmax\n.\n2\n2k\nk\n\n(4)\n\nThen with lmax \u223c kR, at high energies\n\u03c3R \u21d2 \u03c0R2 ;\n\n(5)\n\nthe geometric cross section as required.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nAlthough on using Eqs. 2 and 3 to match values of (theoretically) calculated total reaction\ncross sections led [8] to the three parameters l0 (E, A), a(E, A), and \u01eb(E, A) having smooth\nvariations with energy, there are discrepancies between those predictions and the actual\nmeasured data. Herein we modify the method of selection of those parameter values to\nproduce more accurate reaction cross section values, while keeping as smooth a variation\nwith energy of those parameters as possible. Specifically, in Eq. 3, we have set the \u01eb as a\nconstant (\u22121.5) and so independent of energy and of mass. Further we assume that a(E, A)\nvaries linearly with the wave vector,\nk=\n\n1\u221a 2\nE \u2212 m2 c4 ,\n~c\n\n(6)\n\nand with the form\na(E, A) \u223c 1.02k \u2212 0.25 .\n\n(7)\n\nThen l0 (E, A) were adjusted to ensure that all measured total reaction cross section values\nare matched by using the function form, Eq. 3.\nThe resultant optimized values for the parameter l0 are presented in Fig. 1. In this figure,\nthe points represent the calculated values of l0 at particular energies where the experimental\nvalues of total reaction cross sections are available for the considered nuclei. We have used\nthe lower and upper uncertainty limits to get the error bars for l0 values. We call these\nl0 values with uncertainties as \"data-l0 \" hereafter. The curves result on using a spline\ninterpolation on those data points constrained to give an optimal smoothness variation of\nl0 (E, A) with E. The figure displays the results for the entire energy range (to 300 MeV) in\nthe left hand panels, while the right hand panels emphasize the low energy variations to 50\nMeV since most experimental values lie in that range of energy.\nIn panel (a) of Fig. 1, the solid, dotted, dashed, long-dashed, and dot-dashed lines depict\nthe values for 9 Be, 12 C, 16 O, 19 F, and 27 Al respectively, as do circles, squares, diamonds, up\ntriangles and down triangles for the data-l0 results. The same legends apply to the 10 to\n50 MeV plots shown in panel (b). In panels (c) and (d), the energy variations of l0 values\nfor 40 Ca, 63 Cu, 90 Zr, 118 Sn, and 140 Ce are presented by solid, dotted, dashed, long-dashed\nand dot-dashed lines respectively. The corresponding data-l0 points are also presented by\n3\n\n\f15\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n11\n\n10\n5\n\n20\n\nl0 15\n\n9\n\n10\n\n7\n\n5\n\n5\n(e)\n\n25\n\n14\n\n(f)\n\n10\n15\n\n6\n\n5\n\n2\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nEP(MeV)\nFIG. 1: The parameter values for l0 in the simple functional form for the p-A reaction cross sections.\nPoints shown with error bars are the values required to match actual measured data values.\n\ncircles, squares, diamonds, up triangles and down triangles. Finally , in panels (e) and\n(f), we display the variations of l0 with energy for 159 Tb, 181 Ta, 197 Au, 208 Pb and 238 U by\nsolid, dotted, dashed, long-dashed and dot-dashed lines respectively with the corresponding\ndata-l0 points presented by circles, squares, diamonds, up triangles and down triangles.\nNumerical values for l0 that result from the simple functional form calculations and as\ndisplayed by the curves in Fig. 1, are listed at various energies in Table. I. For energies 50\nMeV and higher, these l0 values monotonically increase with mass and energy as might be\nanticipated. At lower energies however, and while the l0 values do still vary monotonically\nwith energy, there is structure in their mass variation. In particular, the values of l0 for\n197\nAu, 208 Pb and 238 U in the energy range from 10 MeV to 20 MeV decrease with mass.

The results are not as smooth as the counterpart variation with\nenergy particularly at the lowest of the energy set. That may reflect the scattered (in energy)\nnature of the actual data from which starting values of l0 have been taken to generate the\nfunctional forms.\nIn Figs. 3, 4, and 5, we show the total reaction cross sections generated using the\nsimple functional form and tabled values of l0 , and displayed by the solid curves, with\n4\n\n\fTABLE I: l0 values for different nuclei at different energies.\nEnergy\n(MeV)\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n\nNucleus\n9 Be 12 C 16 O 19 F\n\n3.43\n4.65\n5.03\n5.29\n5.34\n5.44\n5.51\n5.46\n5.48\n5.42\n5.63\n5.65\n5.61\n6.07\n\n3.08\n4.37\n4.91\n5.17\n5.34\n5.50\n5.54\n5.45\n5.57\n5.64\n5.97\n6.70\n7.29\n7.64\n\n3.11\n4.72\n5.40\n5.78\n6.00\n6.28\n6.53\n6.66\n6.85\n7.05\n7.72\n8.47\n9.06\n9.58\n\n4.04\n5.32\n6.04\n6.34\n6.53\n6.75\n6.83\n7.00\n7.08\n7.19\n7.98\n8.73\n9.39\n9.96\n\n27 Al\n\n4.02\n5.44\n6.43\n6.86\n7.17\n7.35\n7.49\n7.52\n7.66\n7.88\n9.09\n10.17\n11.15\n12.01\n\n40 Ca 63 Cu\n\n4.12\n5.82\n7.09\n7.69\n8.14\n8.56\n8.88\n9.13\n9.38\n9.63\n10.87\n12.04\n13.17\n14.23\n\n4.47\n6.40\n7.77\n8.73\n9.46\n10.01\n10.46\n10.80\n11.19\n11.44\n13.14\n14.58\n16.12\n17.22\n\n90 Zr 118 Sn 140 Ce 159 Tb 181 Ta 197 Au 208 Pb 238 U\n\n4.18\n6.46\n8.42\n9.76\n10.31\n10.98\n11.60\n12.16\n12.71\n13.20\n14.70\n16.18\n17.90\n20.05\n\n4.15\n7.56\n9.47\n10.74\n11.64\n12.50\n13.10\n13.76\n14.04\n14.48\n16.82\n19.08\n20.19\n22.37\n\n3.67\n7.51\n9.36\n10.75\n11.79\n12.76\n13.65\n14.46\n15.06\n15.61\n17.95\n19.86\n21.33\n23.79\n\n3.47\n7.65\n9.67\n11.13\n12.37\n13.34\n14.12\n14.83\n15.53\n16.21\n18.71\n20.68\n22.38\n24.70\n\n3.57\n7.66\n9.65\n11.13\n12.38\n13.48\n14.47\n15.22\n16.02\n16.64\n19.41\n21.50\n23.65\n25.91\n\n2.75\n7.24\n9.60\n11.25\n12.68\n13.75\n14.61\n15.41\n16.09\n16.88\n19.92\n22.23\n24.40\n26.90\n\n2.87\n7.45\n10.14\n11.99\n13.19\n14.18\n14.94\n15.76\n16.59\n17.25\n20.25\n22.75\n25.01\n27.41\n\n2.19\n7.28\n10.26\n12.31\n13.87\n15.15\n16.22\n16.90\n17.79\n18.51\n21.65\n24.34\n26.24\n28.11\n\nthose obtained from calculations made using g-folding optical potentials [5]. Dashed lines\nrepresent the predictions obtained from those microscopic optical model calculations. The\nexperimental data [9] are depicted by circles.\nThe results for scattering from 9 Be, 12 C, 16 O, 19 F, 27 Al, and 40 Ca are displayed in segments\n(a) through (f) of Fig. 3 respectively. In segment (a), the data are well reproduced by the\ng-folding predictions resulting from the folding with the 9 Be ground state OBDME found\nwith (0+2)~\u03c9 spectroscopy as well as by those obtained with the simple functional form\nmethod.\nCalculated p-12 C reaction cross sections are compared with the experimental data in\nsegment (b) of Fig. 3. The reaction cross sections obtained from g-folding calculations are\nin good agreement with the experimental data but only in the energy range above 20 MeV.\nOn the other hand, the results obtained from the simple functional method are excellent\nfor all energies, replicating the average trend of data well even in the lower energy range\nfrom 10 MeV. There are two data points, at 61 MeV and at 77 MeV, in disagreement with\nthe calculated results however. But, as noted previously [1], these data points should be\ndiscounted.\nPredictions for p-16 O and for p-19 F scattering are compared with data in segments (c) and\n(d) of Fig. 3. For p-16 O case, there are many data points at the energies between 20 to 40\nMeV. Predictions from g-folding calculations while replicating the data well at and above 25\nMeV, overestimate at lower energies. That g-folding result also underestimates the datum\nat 250 MeV; the sole datum above 50 MeV. In contrast, and by design, the results obtained\nfrom the simple functional method are in excellent agreement with the experimental data at\nall energies. For p-19 F, although g-folding calculations reproduce the data well, the simple\nfunctional form method gives slightly more accurate predictions.\nTotal reaction cross section predictions for p-27 Al and for p-40 Ca are compared with the\nexperimental data in segments (f) and (g) of Fig. 3.

The g-folding results underestimate them noticeably. But predictions from a\nsimple functional form approach replicate the data well at all energies. One data point at\n61 MeV is exceptional in the set. With 40 Ca, the folding model approach is not expected\nto be reliable at the energies in the range 10 to 20 MeV, as is the case with 12 C, since for\nexcitation energies of that range, both nuclei have clearly discrete spectra. That is true for\nmost light mass nuclei but little or no total reaction cross sections have been reported for\nthem. Indeed the reaction data from both 12 C and from 40 Ca show rather sharp resonance\nfeatures below 20 MeV. Both the g-folding calculations and functional form calculations\nreproduce the rest of the 40 Ca data well.\nThe results for scattering from 63 Cu, 90 Zr, 118 Sn, 140 Ce, 159 Tb, and 181 Ta are displayed in\nFig. 4 in segments (a) through (f) respectively. For 63 Cu, predictions at low energies may be\nslightly too small and the parameter sets driven too severely by the sole datum at 30 MeV\n6\n\n\f600\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\n400\n200\n\n\u03c3R(mb)\n\n700\n500\n300\n900\n700\n500\n300\n10\n\n20 30 40 60\n\n100\n\n300\n\n20 30 40 60\n\n100\n\n300\n\nEP(MeV)\nFIG. 3: Energy dependence of \u03c3R for proton scattering from (a) 9 Be, (b) 12 C, (c) 16 O, (d) 19 F,\n(e) 27 Al and (f) 40 Ca. Dashed lines represent the results obtained from g-folding optical potential\ncalculations while the solid curves portray the values obtained by using simple functional form.\n\nin the range 20 to 70 MeV. Also the data in the range 100 to 300 MeV are quite scattered\nbut the simple functional form gives a good average result.\nIn segment (b) of Fig. 4, the predicted total reaction cross sections from p-90 Zr scattering\nare compared with the experimental data. Results from g-folding calculations are in good\nagreement with the data although the data value at 30 MeV is overestimated. The results\nobtained from the simple functional form, and by dint of construction, are in excellent\nagreement with the experimental data at the few energies measured, but the shape is not\noptimally smooth. This we believe is the prime cause for the kink shown at A = 90 in the\nmass variation plots in Fig. 2 and most noticeably at 200 MeV. Lack of data meant that we\nhad to use the g-folding values to specify the functional form. That is also the case with\nmasses 140, 159, and 181.\nThe p-118 Sn total reaction cross section results are given in segment (c) of Fig. 4 where\nthe two predictions again are compared with the data. Although not as good as the results\nfound for scattering from light mass nuclei, the g-folding potential still gives reasonable\nshape prediction. However, the model underestimates the data by 5 to 10%. But the simple\nfunctional form model form again gives an excellent reproduction of the data at all energies\nexcept 61 MeV. This 61 MeV data point is again exceptional being much smaller than other\n7\n\n\f1300\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1100\n900\n700\n\n\u03c3R(mb)\n\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\n1600\n1200\n800\n\n(f)\n\n(e)\n\n1800\n1400\n1000\n600\n10\n\n20 30 40 60\n\n100\n\n300\n\n20 30 40 60\n\n100\n\n300\n\nEP(MeV)\nFIG. 4: Same as Fig. 3 but from (a)\n\n63 Cu,\n\n(b)\n\n90 Zr,\n\n(c)\n\n118 Sn,\n\n(d)\n\n140 Ce,\n\n(e)\n\n159 Tb\n\nand (f)\n\n181 Ta.\n\ndata and the predictions as in the cases of 12 C and 27 Al.\nPredictions for p-140 Ce, p-159 Tb and for p-181 Ta scattering are compared with the (limited\namount of) data in segments (d), (e) and (f) of Fig. 4 respectively. The g-folding calculations\ngive good agreement with that data for p-140 Ce, slightly underestimate the data for p-159 Tb,\nand for p-181 Ta, underestimate data at the energies to 20 MeV and overestimate data in the\nenergy range 40 to 60 MeV. In all cases results predicted by the simple functional form are\nexcellent reproductions of the experimental data.\nIn segments (a), (b) and (c) of Fig. 5 we compare the calculated total reaction cross\nsections for p-197 Au, p-208 Pb and p-238 U scattering with the available data. For 197 Au, the\ng-folding optical potential calculations are in good agreement with most data; the 29 MeV\ndatum grossly underestimated by the calculations. But that data point is also at odds with\nthe energy trend of the other data. Save for that 29 MeV value, the simple functional\nform gives even better predictions of the data. The energy variation of the p-208 Pb reaction\ncross sections is shown in segment (b) of Fig. 5 where the predictions from g-folding optical\npotential calculations and from the simple functional form calculations are compared with\na fairly extensive set of experimental data. In making the g-folding potentials, we have\nused Skyrme-Hartree-Fock wave functions [3] which have been shown to be more realistic [5]\nthan simple oscillator model ones. Still such g-folding calculations underestimate the data\nup to 50 MeV. But simple functional form calculations are in excellent agreement with the\n8\n\n\f2000\n1600\n1200\n\n(a)\n\n800\n\n\u03c3R(mb)\n\n2000\n1600\n1200\n\n(b)\n\n800\n2000\n1600\n(c)\n\n1200\n800\n10\n\n20 30\n\n60\n\n100\n\n300\n\nEP(MeV)\nFIG. 5: Same as Fig. 3 but from (a)\n\n197 Au,\n\n(b)\n\n208 Pb,\n\nand (c)\n\n238 U.\n\nexperimental data, save that data values at 30, 61 and 77 MeV again are exceptional. The\npredictions of total reaction cross sections for p-238 U scattering from the g-folding optical\npotential calculations and from using the simple functional form are compared with the few\ndata in segment (c) of Fig. 5. Given the lack of data the two results are virtually identical.\nAs a final note regarding many of the exceptional data values so defined in the foregoing,\nMenet et al. [10] argue that there may be a systematic error in the studies reported in those\nexperiments.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe measured reaction cross sections for 10\u2013300 MeV proton scattering from nuclei ranging in mass from 9 Be to 238 U are well reproduced by calculations made using a three parameter function. The values of the parameters (l0 , a, \u01eb) are set in a simple manner and\nwhen set by enough actual data, can be used to predict the total reaction cross sections at\nany energy for a given nucleus. The mass variations of those parameters at fixed energies\nalso are smooth, and very much so when data exists to control the results, and we believe\nthat the simple functional form also can be used to find reasonable estimates of the total\nreaction cross sections of protons from any stable nucleus in the mass range.\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThis research was supported by a research grant from the Australian Research Council.\n\n[1] P.
