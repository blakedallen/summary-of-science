Conclusion and perspectives\nGlossary\nReferences\n\n\f2\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe first demonstration of oscillation of a superconducting qubit by Nakamura et al. in 19991 can be\nsaid to represent the \"tip of the iceberg\": it rests on\na huge volume of advanced research on Josephson junctions (JJ) and circuits developed during the last 25\nyears. Some of this work has concerned fundamental research on Josephson junctions and superconducting quantum interferometers (SQUIDs) aimed at understanding macroscopic quantum coherence (MQC)2,3,4,5 ,\nproviding the foundation of the persistent current flux\nqubit6,7,8 . However, there has also been intense research\naimed at developing superconducting flux-based digital\nelectronics and computers9,10,11 . Moreover, in the 1990's\nthe single-Cooper-pair box/transistor (SCB, SCT)12 , was\ndeveloped experimentally and used to demonstrate the\nquantization of Cooper pairs on a small superconducting\nisland13 , which is the foundation of the charge qubit1,14 .\nSince\nthen\nthere\nhas\nbeen\na\nsteady\ndevelopment15,16,17,18,19 , with observation of microwaveinduced Rabi oscillation of the two-level populations\nin charge21,22,23 , and flux24,25,26,27 qubits and dcpulse driven oscillation of charge qubits with rf-SET\ndetection28 . An important step is the development of the\ncharge-phase qubit, a hybrid version of the charge qubit\nconsisting of an SCT in a superconducting loop21,22 ,\ndemonstrating Rabi oscillations with very long coherence\ntime, of the order of 1 \u03bcs, allowing a large set of basic\nand advanced (\"NMR-like\") one-qubit operations (gates)\nto be performed23 . In addition, coherent oscillations\nhave been demonstrated in the \"simplest\" JJ qubits of\nthem all, namely a single Josephson junction30,31,32,33 ,\nor a two-JJ dc-SQUID34 , where the qubit is formed by\nthe two lowest states in the periodic potential of the JJ\nitself.\nAlthough a powerful JJ-based quantum computer with\nhundreds of qubits remains a distant goal, systems with\n5-10 qubits will be built and tested by, say, 2010. Pairwise coupling of qubits for two-qubit gate operations is\nthen an essential task, and a few experiments with coupled JJ-qubits with fixed capacitive or inductive couplings have been reported35,36,37,38,39,40 , in particular the\nfirst realization of a controlled-NOT gate with two coupled SCBs36 , used together with a one-qubit Hadamard\ngate to generate an entangled two-qubit state.\nFor scalability, and simple operation, the ability to control qubit couplings, e.g. switching them on and off, will\nbe essential. So far, experiments on coupled JJ qubits\nhave been performed without direct physical control of\nthe qubit coupling, but there are many proposed schemes\nfor two(multi)-qubit gates based on fixed or controllable\nphysical qubit-qubit couplings or tunings of qubits and\nbus resonators.\nAll of the JJ-circuit devices introduced above are\nbased on nanoscale science and technology and represent\nemerging technologies for quantum engineering and, at\nbest, information processing. One may debate the impor-\n\ntance of quantum computers on any time scale, but there\nis no doubt that the research will be a powerful driver of\nthe development of solid-state quantum state engineering\nand quantum technology, e.g. performing measurements\n\"at the edge of the impossible\".\nThis article aims at describing the inner workings of\nsuperconducting Josephson junction (JJ) circuits, how\nthese can form two-level systems acting as qubits, and\nhow they can be coupled together to multi-qubit networks. Since the field of experimental qubit applications\nis only five years old, it is not even clear if the field represents an emerging technology for computers. Nevertheless, the JJ-technology is presently the only example of a\nworking solid state qubit with long coherence time, with\ndemonstrated two-qubit gate operation and readout, and\nwith potential for scalability. This makes it worthwile to\ndescribe this system in some detail.\nIt needs to be said, however, that much of the basic\ntheory for coupled JJ-qubits was worked out well ahead\nof experiment14,41,42 , defining and elaborating basic operation and coupling schemes. We recommend the reader\nto take a good look at the excellent research and review paper by Makhlin et al.42 which describes the basic\nprinciples of a multi-JJ-qubit information processor, including essential schemes for qubit-qubit coupling. The\nambition of the present article is to provide a both introductory and in-depth overview of essential Josephson\njunction quantum circuits, discuss basic issues of readout\nand measurement, and connect to the recent experimental progress with JJ-based qubits for quantum information processing (JJ-QIP).\n\nII.\n\nNANOTECHNOLOGY, COMPUTERS AND\nQUBITS\n\nThe scaling down of microelectronics into the nanometer range will inevitably make quantum effects like tunneling and wave propagation important. This will eventually impede the functioning of classical transistor components, but will also open up new opportunities for\nmulti-terminal components and logic circuits built on e.g.\nresonant tunneling, ballistic transport, single electronics,\netc.\nThere are two main branches of fundamentally different computer architectures, namely logically irreversible\nand logically reversible. Ordinary computers are irreversible because they dissipate both energy and information. Even if CMOS circuits in principle only draw\ncurrent when switching, this is nevertheless the source\nof intense local heat generation, threatening to burn up\nfuture processor chips. The energy dissipation can in\nprinciple be reduced by going to single-electron devices,\nsuperconducting electronics and quantum devices, but\nthis does not alter the fact that the information processing is logically irreversible. In the simplest case of an\nAND gate, two incoming bit lines only result in a single\nbit output, which means that one bit is in practice erased\n\n\f3\n(initialized to zero) and the heat irreversibly dissipated\nto the environment. The use of quantum-effect devices\ndoes not change the fact that we are dealing with computers where each gate is logically irreversible and where\ndiscarded information constantly is erased and turned\ninto heat. A computer with quantum device components\ntherefore does not make a quantum computer.\nA quantum information processor has to be built on\nfundamentally reversible schemes with reversible gates\nwhere no information is discarded, and where all internal processes in the components are elastic. This issue\nis connected with the problem of the minimum energy\nneeded for performing a calculation43 (connected with\nthe entropy change created by erasing the final result,\ni.e. reading the result and then clearing the register). A\nreversible information processor can in principle be built\nby classical means using adiabatically switched networks\nof different kinds. The principles were investigated in the\n1980's and form a background for much of the work on\nquantum computation44,45,46,47,48,49,50 . Recently there\nhas been some very interesting development of reversible\ncomputers (see51,52,53,54 and references therein). However, a reversible computer still does not make a quantum computer. What is characteristic for a quantum\ncomputer is that it is reversible and quantum coherent,\nmeaning that one can build entangled non-classical multiqubit states.\nOne can broadly distinguish between microscopic,\nmesoscopic and macroscopic qubits. Microscopic effective two-level systems are localized systems confined by\nnatural or artificial constraining potentials. Natural systems then typically are atomic or molecular impurities\nutilizing electronic charge, or electronic or nuclear spins.\nThese systems may be implanted55,56 or naturally occurring due to the material growth process57 . A related\ntype of impurity qubit involves endohedral fullerenes, i.e.\natoms implanted into C60 or similar cages58 , to be placed\nat specific positions on a surface prepared for control and\nreadout.\nMesoscopic qubit systems typically involve geometrically defined confining potentials like quantum dots.\nQuantum dots (QD) for qubits59 are usually made in\nsemiconductor materials. One type of QD is a small\nnatural or artificial semiconductor grain with quantized\nelectronic levels. The electronic excitations may be excitonic (excitons,60,61 or biexcitons,62 ), charge-like63, or\nspin-like (e.g. singlet-triplet)64,65 . Another type of QD\nis geometrically defined in semiconductor 2DEG by electrostatic split-gate arrangements. Although the host materials are epitaxially layered semiconducting materials\n(e.g.GaAs/AlGaAs), the ungated 2DEG electronic system is metallic. A split-gate arrangement can then define\na voltage-controlled system of quantum dots coupled to\nmetallic reservoir electrodes, creating a system for electron charge and spin transport through quantum point\ncontacts and (effective) two-level quantum dots64,65,66,67 .\nThere is also a potential qubit based on liquid He\nsuperfluid technology, namely \"Electrons on Helium\",\n\nFIG. 1: 3-junction persistent current flux qubit (PCQ) (inner\nloop) surrounded by a 2-junction SQUID. Courtesy of J.E.\nMooij, TU Delft.\n\nFIG. 2: Single Cooper pair box (SCB) (right) coupled to a\nsingle-electron transistor (SET) (left) for readout. Courtesy\nof P. Delsing, Chalmers.\n\nEoH68 . This is really an atomic-like microscopic qubit:\na thin film of liquid He is made to cover a Si surface,\nand electrons are bound by the image force above the He\nsurface, forming an electronic two-level system. Qubits\nare laterally defined by electrostatic gate patterns in the\nSi substrate, which also defines circuits for qubit control,\nqubit coupling and readout.\nMacroscopic superconducting qubits - the subject of\nthis article - are based on electrical circuits containing\nJosephson junctions (JJ). Looking at two extreme examples, the principle is actually very simple. In one limit,\nthe qubit is simply represented by the two rotation directions of the persistent supercurrent of Cooper pairs in a\nsuperconducting ring containing Josephson tunnel junctions (rf-SQUID)(flux qubit)6,7,8 , shown below in Fig. 1\nfor the Delft 3-junction flux qubit,\nIn another limit, the qubit is represented by the presence or absence of a Cooper pair on a small superconducting island (Single Cooper pair Box, SCB, or Transistor, SCT) (charge qubit)1,13,28,69 , as illustrated in Fig. 2.\nHybrid circuits21,70,71 can in principle be tuned between\nthese limits by varing the relations between the electrostatic charging energy EC and the Josephson tunneling\nenergy EJ .\nAll of these solid-state qubits have advantages and disadvantages, and only systematic research and development of multi-qubit systems will show the practical and\nultimate limitations of various systems. The supercon-\n\n\f4\nducting systems have presently the undisputable advantage of acutally existing, showing Rabi oscillations and\nresponding to one- and two-qubit gate operations. In\nfact, even an elementary SCB two-qubit entangling gate\ncreating Bell-type states has been demonstrated very\nrecently36 . All of the non-superconducting qubits are\nso far, promising but still potential qubits. Several of\nthe impurity electron spin qubits show impressive relaxation lifetimes in bulk measurements, but it remains to\ndemonstrate how to read out individual qubit spins.\nIII.\nA.\n\nBASICS OF QUANTUM COMPUTATION\nConditions for quantum information processing\n\nDiVincenzo72 has formulated a set of rules and conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for quantum\ncomputing to be possible:\n1.

Points on the sphere correspond\nto the quantum states |\u03c8i; in particular, the north and south\npoles correspond to the computational basis states |0i and\n|1i; superposition cat-states |\u03c8i = |0i + ei\u03c6 |1i are situated on\nthe equator.\n\ncan be characterised by a unit vector on the Bloch sphere:\nThe state vector can be represented as a unitary vector\non the Bloch sphere, and general unitary (rotation) operations make it possible to reach every point on the Bloch\nsphere. The qubit is therefore an analogue object with\na continuum of possible states. Only in the case of spin\n1/2 systems do we have a true two-level system. In the\ngeneral case, the qubit is represented by the lowest levels\nof a multi-level system, which means that the length of\nthe state vector may not be conserved due to transitions\nto other levels. The first condition will therefore be to\noperate the qubit so that it stays on the Bloch sphere\n(fidelity). Competing with normal operation, noise from\nthe environment may cause fluctuation of both qubit amplitude and phase, leading to relaxation and decoherence.\nIt is a delicate matter to isolate the qubit from a perturbing environment, and desirable operation and unwanted\nperturbation (noise) easily go hand in hand. It is a major\nissue to design qubit control and read-out such that the\nnecessary communication lines can be blocked when not\nin use.\nThe state of N independent qubits can be represented\nas a product state,\n|\u03c8i = |\u03c81 i|\u03c82 i....|\u03c8N i = |\u03c81 \u03c82 ....\u03c8N i\n\n(3.4)\n\ninvolving any one of all of the configurations |00...0 >,\n|00...1 >, ...., |11...1 >. A general state of an N-qubit\nmemory register (i.e. a many-body system) can then\nbe written as a time-dependent superposition of manyparticle configurations\n|\u03c8(t)i = c1 (t)|0...00i + c2 (t)|0...01i\n+ c3 (t)|0...10i + .... + cn (t)|1...11i\n\n(3.5)\n\n\f5\nwhere the amplitudes ci (t) are complex, providing phase\ninformation. This state represents a time-dependent superposition of 2N N-body configurations which in general cannot be written as a product of one-qubit states\nand then represents an entangled (quantum correlated)\nmany-body state.\nIn the case of two qubits, the maximally entangled\nstates are the so-called Bell states,\n|\u03c8i = (|00i + |11i)/2\n|\u03c8i = (|00i \u2212 |11i)/2\n|\u03c8i = (|01i + |10i)/2\n|\u03c8i = (|01i \u2212 |10i)/2\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n(3.8)\n(3.9)\n\nAnother interesting entangled three-qubit state appears\nin the teleportation process,\n\nC.\n\n(3.11)\n\nOperations and gates\n\nQuantum computation basically means allowing the\nN -body state to develop in a fully coherent fashion\nthrough unitary transformations acting on all N qubits.\nThe time evolution of the many-body system of N twolevel subsystems can be described by the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation for the N -level state vector |\u03c8(t)i,\nih\u0304\u2202t |\u03c8i = \u0124|\u03c8i.\n\n(3.12)\n\nin terms of the time-evolution operator characterizing by\nthe time-dependent many-body Hamiltonian \u0124(t) of the\nsystem determined by the external control operations and\nthe perturbing noise from the environment,\n|\u03c8(t)i = U (t, t0 )|\u03c8(t0 )i.\n\n(3.13)\n\nThe solution of Schr\u00f6dinger equation for U (t, t0 )\nih\u0304\u2202t U (t, t0 ) = \u0124U (t, t0 )\n\n(3.14)\n\nmay be written as\nU (t, t0 ) = 1 \u2212\n\ni\nh\u0304\n\nZ\n\nt\n\n\u0124(t\u2032 )U (t\u2032 , t0 )dt\u2032 ,\n\nThis describes the time-evolution controlled by a homogeneous time-dependent potential or electromagnetic\nfield, e.g. dc or ac pulses with finite rise times but having\nno space-dependence. If the Hamiltonian is constant in\nthe interval [t0 , t], then the evolution operator takes the\nsimple form\ni\n\nwhere the last one is the singlet state. In the case\nof three qubits, the corresponding maximally entangled (\"cat\") states are the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\n(GHZ) states73\n\u221a\n(3.10)\n|\u03c8i = (|000i \u00b1 |111i)/ 8\n\n|\u03c8i = [|00i(a|0i + b|1i) + |01i(a|0i \u2212 b|1i)\n\u221a\n+|10i(b|0i + a|1i) + |11i(b|0i \u2212 a|1i)]/ 8\n\ndescribing the time evolution of the entire N -particle\nstate in the interval [t, t0 ].

In the ideal case, usually not realizable, all terms\nare switched off except for those selected for the specific\ncomputational step. A single qubit gate operation then\ninvolves turning on a particular term in the Hamiltonian\nfor a specific qubit, while a two-qubit gate involves turning on an interaction term between two specific qubits.\nIn principle one can perform an N -qubit gate operation\nby turning on interactions for all N qubits. In practical\ncases, many terms in the Hamiltonian are turned on all\nthe time, leading to a \"background\" time development\nthat has to be taken into account.\nThe basic model for a two-level qubit is the spin-1/2 in\na magnetic field. A system of interacting qubits can then\nbe modelled by a collection of interacting spins, described\nby the Heisenberg Hamiltonian\nX\n1X\n\u0124(t) =\nhi (t) Si +\nJij (t) Si Sj\n(3.19)\n2\ncontrolled by a time-dependent external magnetic field\nhi (t) and by a time-dependent spin-spin coupling Jij (t).\nExpressing the Hamiltonian in Cartesian components,\nhi (t) = (hx , hy , hz ), Si (t) = (Sx , Sy , Sz ) and introducing\nthe Pauli \u03c3-matrices, (Sx , Sy , Sz ) = 12 h\u0304(\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z ) we\nobtain a general N-qubit Hamiltonian with general qubitqubit coupling:\n1X\n(\u01ebi \u03c3zi + Re\u2206i \u03c3xi + Im\u2206i \u03c3yi ) (3.20)\n\u0124 = \u2212\n2 i\n1X\n+\n\u03bb\u03bd,ij (t) \u03c3\u03bdi \u03c3\u03bdj\n2 ij;\u03bd\nX\n(fi (t)\u03c3zi + gxi (t)\u03c3xi + gyi (t)\u03c3yi )\n+\ni\n\nWe have here introduced time-independent components\nof the external field defining qubit energy level splittings\n\u01ebi , Re\u2206i and Im\u2206i along the z and x,y axes, as well\nas time-dependent components fi (t) and gi (t) explicitly\ndescribing qubit operation and readout signals and noise.\n\n\f6\nInserted into Eq.(3.17), this Hamiltonian determines\nthe time evolution of the many-qubit state. In the ideal\ncase one can turn on and off each individual term of the\nHamiltonian, including the two-body interaction, giving\ncomplete control of the evolution of the state.\nIt has been shown that any unitary transformation can\nbe achieved through a quantum network of sequential\napplication of one- and two-qubit gates. Moreover, the\nsize of the coherent workspace of the multi-qubit memory\ncan be varied (in principle) by switching on and off qubitqubit interactions.\nIn the common case of NMR applied to\nmolecules74,75,76 , one has no control of the fixed,\ndirect spin-spin coupling. With an external magnetic\nfield one can control the qubit Zeeman level splittings\n(no control of individual qubits). Individual qubits can\nbe addressed by external RF-fields since the qubits have\ndifferent resonance frequencies (due to different chemical\nenvironments in a molecule). Two-qubit coupling can\nbe induced by simultaneous resonant excitation of two\nqubits.\nIn the case of engineered solid state JJ-circuits, individual qubits can be addressed by local gates, controlling the local electric or magnetic field. Extensive singlequbit operation has recently been demonstrated by Collin\net al.23 . Regarding two-qubit coupling, the field is just\nstarting up, and different options are only beginning to\nbe tested. The most straightforward approaches involve\nfixed capacitive35,36,40 or inductive37,38 coupling; such\nsystems could be operated in NMR style, by detuning\nspecific qubit pairs into resonance. Moreover, there are\nvarious solutions for controlling the direct physical qubitqubit coupling strength, as will be described in Section\nIX.\n\nD.\n\nReadout and state preparation\n\nExternal perturbations, described by fi (t) and gi (t) in\nEq.(3.20) can influence the two-level system in typically\ntwo ways: (i) shifting the individual energy levels, which\nmay change the transition energy and the phase of the\nqubit; and (ii) inducing transitions between the levels,\nchanging the level populations. These effects arise both\nfrom desirable control operations and from unwanted\nnoise (see42,77,78,79 for a discussion of superconducting\ncircuits, and Grangier et al.80 for a discussion of state\npreparation and quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements).\nTo control a qubit register, the important thing is to\ncontrol the decoherence during qubit operation and readout, and in the memory state. In the qubit memory state,\nthe qubit must be isolated from the environment. Operation and read-out devices should be decoupled from\nthe qubit and, ideally, not cause any dephasing or relaxation. The resulting intrinsic qubit life times should be\nlong compared to the duration of the calculation. In the\noperation and readout state, the qubit must be connected\n\nto the operation fields. This also opens up the system\nto a noisy environment, which puts great demands on\nsignal-to-noise ratios.\nThe readout operation is a particularly critical step.\nThe ultimate purpose is to perform a \"single-shot\" quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement, determining\nthe state (|0i or |1i) of the qubit in a single measurement and then leaving the qubit in that very state. During the measurement time, the back-action noise from the\n\"meter\" will cause relaxation and mixing, changing the\nqubit state. The \"meter\" must then be sensitive enough\nto detect the qubit state on a time scale shorter than the\ninduced relaxation time T1\u2217 in the presence of the dissipative back-action of the \"meter\" itself. Under these conditions it is possible to detect the qubit projection in a\nsingle measurement (single shot read-out). Performing a\nsingle-shot projective measurement in the qubit eigenbasis then provides a QND measurement (note the \"trivial\"\nfact that the phase is irreversibly lost in the measurement\nprocess under any circumstances).\nThe readout/measurement processes described above\ncan be related to the Stern-Gerlach (SG) experiment80 .\nA SG spin filter acts as a beam splitter for flying qubits,\ncreating separate paths for spin-up and spin-down atoms,\npreparing for the measurement by making it possible in\nprinciple to distinguish spatially between the two states\nof the qubit. The measurement is then performed by\nparticle counters: a click in, say, the spin-up path collapses the atom to the spin-up state in a single shot.\nThere is essentially no decohering back-action from the\ndetector until the atom is detected. However, after detection of the spin-up atom the state is thoroughly destroyed: this qubit has not only decohered and relaxed,\nbut is removed from the system. However, if it was entangled with other qubits, these are left in a specific eigenstate. For example, if the qubit was part of the Bell pair\n|\u03c8i = (|00i + |11i)/2, detection of spin up (|0i) selects\n|00i and leaves the other qubit in state |0i. If instead the\nqubit was part of the Bell pair |\u03c8i = (|01i + |10i)/2, detection of spin up (|0i) selects |01i and leaves the other\nqubit in the spin-down state |1i. Furthermore,\nfor the\n\u221a\n3-qubit GHZ state |\u03c8i = (|000i \u00b1 |111i)/ 8, detection\nof the first qubit in the spin up (|0i) state leaves the\nremaining 2-qubit system in the |00i state.\nFinally, in the case of the three-qubit entangled state\nin the teleportation process, Eq.(3.11), detection of the\nfirst qubit in the spin up state |0i, leaves the remaining\n2-qubit system in the entangled state [|0i(a|0i + b|1i) +\n|1i(a|0i\u2212b|1i)]/2. Moreover, detection of also the second\nqubit in the spin-up state\u221a|0i will leave the third qubit\nin the state (a|0i + b|1i)/ 2. In this way, measurement\ncan be used for state preparation.\nApplying this discussion to the measurement and readout of JJ-qubit circuits, an obvious difference is that the\nJJ-qubits are not flying particles. The detection can\nthere not be turned on simply by the qubit flying into\nthe detector. Instead, the detector is part of the JJ-qubit\ncircuitry, and must be turned on to discriminate between\n\n\f7\nthe two qubit states. These are not spatially separated\nand therefore sensitive to level mixing by detector noise\nwith frequency around the qubit transition energy. The\nsensitivity of the detector determines the time scale Tm\nof the measurement, and the detector-on back-action determines the time scale of qubit relaxation T1\u2217 . Clearly\nTm \u226a T1\u2217 is needed for single-shot discrimination of |0i\nand |1i. This requires a detector signal-to-noise (S/N)\nratio \u226b 1, in which case one will have the possibility also\nto turn off the detector and leave the qubit in the determined eigenstate, now relaxing on the much longer time\nscale T1 of the \"isolated\" qubit. This would then be the\nultimate QND measurement.\nNote that in the above discussion, the qubit dephasing time (\"isolated\" qubit) does not enter because it is\nassumed to be much longer than the measurement time,\nTm \u226a T\u03c6 . This condition is obviously essential for utilizing the measurement process for state preparation and\nerror correction.\n\nIV.\n\nDYNAMICS OF TWO-LEVEL SYSTEMS\n\nTo perform computational tasks one must be able to\nput a qubit in an arbitrary state. This is usually done\nin two steps. The first step, initialization, consists of\nrelaxation of the initial qubit state to the equilibrium\nstate due to interaction with environment. At low temperature, this state is close to the ground state. During\nthe next step, time dependent dc- or rf-pulses are applied to the controlling gates: electrostatic gate in the\ncase of charge qubits, bias flux in the case of flux qubits,\nand bias current in the case of the JJ qubit. Formally,\nthe pulses enter as time-dependent contributions to the\nHamiltonian and the state evolves under the action of the\ntime-evolution operator. To study the dynamics of a single qubit two-level system we therefore first describe the\ntwo-level state, and then the evolution of this state under\nthe influence of the control pulses (\"perturbations\").\n\nA.\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe qubit eigenstates are to be found from the stationary\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation\n(4.2)\n\nTo solve the S-equation we expand the 1-qubit state in a\ncomplete basis, e.g. the basis states of the \u03c3z operator,\n|\u03c8i =\n\nX\nk\n\nak |ki = c0 |0i + c1 |1i\n\nobtaining the ususal matrix equation\nX\nhk|\u0124|miam = Eak\n\n(4.5)\n\nm\n\nwhere ak = hk|\u03c8i, and\n\u01eb\n\u2206\nHqp = \u2212 hk|\u03c3z |mi \u2212 hk|\u03c3x |mi\n2\n2\n\n(4.3)\n\n(4.6)\n\ngiving the Hamiltonian matrix\n1\n\u0124 = \u2212\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u01eb \u2206\n\u2206 \u2212\u01eb\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is then given by\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u01eb + 2E\na1\n\u2206\n(\u0124 \u2212 E)|\u03c8i = \u2212\n=0\na2\n\u2206\n\u2212\u01eb + 2E\n2\n(4.8)\nThe eigenvalues are determined by\n1\ndet(\u0124 \u2212 E) = E 2 \u2212 (\u01eb2 + \u22062 ) = 0\n4\n\n(4.9)\n\nwith the result\nE1,2 = \u00b1\n\n1p 2\n\u01eb + \u22062\n2\n\n(4.10)\n\nThe eigenvectors are given by:\n\na2 = \u2212a1\n\n\u2206\n\u01eb + 2E\n\n\u00132\n\n1\n= \u221a\n2\n\n(4.11)\n\nAfter normalisation\n\na1 = 1/ 1 +\n\nThe general 1-qubit Hamiltonian has the form\n\n\u0124|\u03c8i = E|\u03c8i\n\n(4.4)\n\nm\n\ns\n\nThe two-level state\n\n1\n\u0124 = \u2212 (\u01eb \u03c3z + \u2206 \u03c3x )\n2\n\nand project onto the basis states\nX\n\u0124\n|mihm|\u03c8i = E|\u03c8i\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206\n\u01eb + 2E\n\nr\n1\u00b1\n\n\u01eb\n|2E|\n\nr\nq\n1\n\u01eb\n2\na2 = \u00b1 1 \u2212 a1 = \u00b1 \u221a\n1\u2213\n|2E|\n2\n\n(4.12)\n\n(4.13)\n\nWe finally simplify the notation by fixing the signs of\nthe amplitudes,\nr\nr\n1\n1\n\u01eb\n\u01eb\n; a2 = \u221a\n;\n(4.14)\na1 = \u221a\n1+\n1\u2212\n|2E|\n|2E|\n2\n2\nand explicitly writing down all the energy eigenstates,\n|E1 i = a1 |0i + a2 |1i\n|E2 i = a2 |0i \u2212 a1 |1i\n\n(4.15)\n(4.16)\n\n\f8\ngiving a 3-vector representation for the Hamiltonian,\n\nwhere\nq\nq\n1\n1\n\u01eb21 + \u220621 ; E2 = +\n\u01eb21 + \u220621\nE1 = \u2212\n2\n2\n\nThe sign of |E2 i has been chosen to give the familiar\nexpression for the superposition\n\u221a at the degeneracy point\n\u01eb1 = 0 where |a1 | = |a2 | = 1/ 2,\n1\n|E1 i = \u221a (|0i + |1i)\n2\n1\n|E2 i = \u221a (|0i \u2212 |1i)\n2\nB.\n\nH = (Hx , Hy , Hz ).\n\n(4.17)\n\n(4.25)\n\nshown in Fig. 4.\n\n0\n\nH\n\n(4.18)\n(4.19)\n\n\u03c1\n\nThe state evolution on the Bloch sphere\n\nTo study the time-evolution of a general state, a convenient way is to expand in the basis of energy eigenstates,\n|\u03c8(t)i = c1 |E1 ie\u2212iE1 t + c2 |E2 ie\u2212iE2 t\n\n(4.20)\n\nIf we know the coefficients at t = 0, then we know the\ntime evolution.

Indeed, by introducing parameterization, c1 = cos \u03b8\u2032 , c2 = sin \u03b8\u2032 ei\u03c6\u2032 , we see\nthat according to Eq.

The primed angles here refer\nto a new coordinate system on the Bloch sphere related to\nthe energy eigenbasis, which is obtained by rotation from\nthe earlier introduced computational basis, Eq.

Sudden pulse switching means that\nthe time-dependent Hamiltonian is changed so fast on\nthe time scale of the evolution of the state vector that\nthe state vector can be treated as time-independent frozen - during the switching time interval. This implies\n\n\f9\nthat the system is excited by a Fourier spectrum with an\nupper cut-off given by the inverse of the switching time.\nIn the specific scheme of sudden switching of different\nterms in the Hamiltonian using dc-pulses, the initial state\nis frozen during the switching event, and begins to evolve\nin time under the influence of the new\n|0i = |\u03c8(0)i = c1 |E1 i + c2 |E2 i\n\nH\n\n\u03c1\nH\n\n\u03c1\n\n(4.28)\n\nb)\n\na)\n\nTo find the coefficients we project onto the charge basis,\nk=0,1\n\nH\n\nH\nh0|0i = c1 h0|E1 i + c2 h0|E2 i\nh1|0i = c1 h1|E1 i + c2 h1|E2 i\n\n(4.29)\n(4.30)\n\nand use the explict results for the energy eigenstates to\ncalculate the matrix elements, obtaining\n1 = c1 a 1 + c2 a 2\n0 = c1 a 2 \u2212 c2 a 1\n\n(4.31)\n(4.32)\n\nAs a result,\n|0i = a1 |E1 i + a2 |E2 i\n\n(4.33)\n\nThis stationary state then develops in time governed by\nthe constant Hamiltonian as\n|\u03c8(t)i = a1 e\u2212iE1 t |E1 i + a2 e\u2212iE2 t |E2 i\n\n(4.34)\n\nInserting the energy eigenstates we finally obtain the time\nevolution in the charge basis,\n\n|0i\n\n\u0002\n\na21 e\u2212iE1 t\n\n+\n\na22 eiE1 t\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0002\n\n+ |1i a1 a2 (e\n\n\u2212iE1 t\n\n|\u03c8(t)i =\n\u0003\n\u2212 eiE1 t )\n(4.35)\n\nThe probability amplitudes of finding the system in one\nof the two charge states is then\n\u0003\n\u0002\n(4.36)\nh0|\u03c8(t)i = a21 e\u2212iE1 t + a22 eiE1 t\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212iE1 t\niE1 t\nh1|\u03c8(t)i = a1 a2 (e\n\u2212e\n)\n(4.37)\n\nIf the system is driven\u221ato the degeneracy point \u01eb1 = 0,\nwhere |a1 | = |a2 | = 1/ 2, then\nh0|\u03c8(t)i = cos E1 t\nh1|\u03c8(t)i = sin E1 t\n\n(4.38)\n(4.39)\n\nIn particular, the probability of finding the system in\nstate |1i (level 2) oscillates like\np2 (t) = |h1|\u03c8(t)i| = sin2 E1 t\n1\n= [1 \u2212 cos (E2 \u2212 E1 )t]\n2\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c1\n\nd)\n\nc)\n\nFIG. 5: Qubit operations with dc-pulses: the vector H represents the qubit Hamiltonian, and the vector \u03c1 represents the\nqubit state. a) The qubit is initialized to the ground state;\nb) the Hamiltonian vector H is suddenly rotated towards xaxis, and the qubit state vector \u03c1 starts to precess around\nH; c) when qubit vector reaches the south pole of the Bloch\nsphere, the Hamiltonian vector H is switched back to the\ninitial position; the vector \u03c1 remains at the south pole, indicating complete inversion of the level population (\u03c0-pulse); d)\nif the Hamiltonian vector H is switched back when the qubit\nvector reaches the equator of the Bloch sphere (\u03c0/2-pulse),\nthen the \u03c1 vector remains precessing at the equator, representing equal-weighted superposition of the qubit states (cat\nstates) |\u03c8i = |0i + ei\u03c6 |1i; this operation is the basis for the\nHadamard gate.\n\nLet us consider, for example, the diagonal qubit Hamiltonian, \u0124 = (\u01eb/2)\u03c3z , and apply a pulse \u03b4\u01eb during a\ntime \u03c4 . This operation will shift phases of the qubit\neigenstates by, \u00b1\u03b4\u01eb\u03c4 /2h\u0304. If the applied pulse is such\nthat \u01eb is switched off, and instead, the \u03c3x component,\n\u2206, is switched on, Fig 5, then the state vector will rotate around the x-axis, and after the time \u2206\u03c4 /2h\u0304 = \u03c0\n(\u03c0-pulse) the ground state, |+i, will flip and become,\n|+i \u2192 |\u2212i. This manipulation corresponds to the quantum NOT operation. Furthermore, if the pulse duration\nis twice smaller (\u03c0/2-pulse), then the ground state vector\nwill approach the equator of the Bloch sphere and precess along it after the end of the operation.

This implies that energy is conserved and no transitions are induced - the\nsystem stays in the same energy level (although the state\nchanges).\nE.\n\nHarmonic perturbation and Rabi oscillation\n\nA particularly interesting and practically important\ncase concerns harmonic perturbation with small amplitude \u03bb and resonant frequency h\u0304\u03c9 = E2 \u2212 E1 . Let us\nconsider the situation when the harmonic perturbation\nis added to the z-component of the Hamiltonian corresponding to a modulation of the qubit bias with a microwave field.\nIn the eigenbasis of the non-perturbed qubit, |E1 i,\n|E2 i, the Hamiltonian will take the form,\n\u0124 = E1 \u03c3z + cos \u03c9t (\u03bbz \u03c3z + \u03bbx \u03c3x ) ,\n\u03bbz = \u03bb\n\n\u01eb\n\u2206\n, \u03bbx = \u03bb .\nE2\nE2\n\n(4.41)\n(4.42)\n\nThe first perturbative term determines small periodic oscillations of the qubit energy splitting, while the second\nterm will induce interlevel transitions. Despite the amplitude of the perturbation being small, \u03bb/E2 \u226a 1, the\nsystem will be driven far away from the initial state because of the resonance. Indeed, let us consider the wave\nfunction of the driven qubit on the form\n|\u03c8i = a(t)e\u2212iE1 t/h\u0304 |E1 i + b(t)e\u2212iE2 t/h\u0304 |E2 i.\n\nThus, the dynamics of a driven qubit is characterized by\na linear combination of the two wave functions,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n|\u03c8 (1) i = \u221a e\u2212i\u03bbx t/2h\u0304 e\u2212iE1 t/h\u0304 |E1 i + e\u2212iE2 t/h\u0304 |E2 i ,\n2\n\u0011\n1 i\u03bbx t/2h\u0304 \u0010 \u2212iE1 t/h\u0304\n(2)\ne\n|\u03c8 i = \u221a e\n|E1 i \u2212 e\u2212iE2 t/h\u0304 |E2 i .\n2\n(4.48)\nLet us assume that the qubit was initially in the ground\nstate, |E1 i, and that the perturbation was switched on\ninstantly. Then the wave function of the driven qubit\nwill take the form,\n\u03bbx t \u2212iE1 t/h\u0304\n\u03bbx t \u2212iE2 t/h\u0304\ne\n|E1 i + i sin\ne\n|E2 i.\n2h\u0304\n2h\u0304\n(4.49)\nCorrespondingly, the probabilities of the level occupations will oscillate in time,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bbx t\n\u03bbx t\n1\n1 + cos\n,\nP1 = cos2\n=\n2h\u0304\n2\nh\u0304\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bbx t\n1\n\u03bbx t\n1 \u2212 cos\n,\n(4.50)\n=\nP2 = sin2\n2h\u0304\n2\nh\u0304\n|\u03c8i = cos\n\nwith small frequency \u03a9R = \u03bbx /h\u0304 \u226a \u03c9, Rabi oscillations,\nillustrated in Fig. 6.\n\n1\n\n(4.43)\n\nSubstituting this ansatz into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\nih\u0304|\u03c8\u0307i = \u0124(t) |\u03c8i,\n\n(4.44)\n\nwe get the following equations for the coefficients,\nih\u0304\u0227 = \u03bbx cos \u03c9t ei(E1 \u2212E2 )t/h\u0304 b,\nih\u0304\u1e03 = \u03bbx cos \u03c9t ei(E2 \u2212E1 )t/h\u0304 a.\n\n0\n(4.45)\n\n(Here we have neglected a small diagonal perturbation,\n\u03bbz .)\nLet us now focus on the slow evolution of the coefficients on the time scale of qubit precession, and average\nEqs.(4.45) over the period of the precession.

The density matrix defined in Section IV B for a pure quantum state\npossesses the projector operator property, \u03c1\u03022 = \u03c1\u0302. This\nassumption can be lifted, and then the density matrix\ndescribes a statistical mixture of pure states, say energy\n\n\f11\neigenstates,\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\nX\ni\n\n\u03c1i |Ei ihEi |.\n\n(4.51)\n\nThe density matrix acquires off-diagonal elements when\nthe basis rotates away from the energy eigenbasis. Such\na mixed state cannot be represented by the vector on the\nBloch sphere; however, its evolution is still described by\nthe Louville equation (4.26),\nih\u0304\u2202t \u03c1\u0302 = [\u0124, \u03c1\u0302].\n\n(4.53)\n\nDissipation is included in the density matrix description by extending the qubit Hamiltonian and including\ninteraction with an environment. The environment for\nmacroscopic superconducting qubits basically consists of\nvarious dissipative elements in external circuits which\nprovide bias, control, and measurement of the qubit. The\n\"off-chip\" parts of these circuits are usually kept at room\ntemperature and produce significant noise. Examples are\nthe fluctuations in the current source producing magnetic\nfield to bias flux qubits and, similarly, fluctuations of the\nvoltage source to bias gate of the charge qubits. Electromagnetic radiation from the qubit during operation is\nanother dissipative mechanisms. There are also intrinsic\nmicroscopic mechanisms of decoherence, such as fluctuating trapped charges in the substrate of the charge qubits,\nand fluctuating trapped magnetic flux in the flux qubits,\nbelieved to produce dangerous 1/f noise. Another intrinsic mechanism is possibly the losses in the tunnel junction\ndielectric layer. Various kinds of environment are commonly modelled with an infinite set of linear oscillators\nin thermal equilibrium (thermal bath), linearly coupled\nto the qubit (Caldeira-Leggett model2,3 ). The extended\nqubit-plus-environment Hamiltonian has the form in the\nqubit energy eigenbasis82,\nX\n1\n\u0124 = \u2212 E\u03c3z +\n(\u03bbiz \u03c3z + \u03bbi\u22a5 \u03c3\u22a5 )Xi\n2\ni\n!\n2 2\nX P\u0302 2\nm\u03c9\nX\ni\ni i\n,\n+\n2m\n2\ni\n\n(4.54)\n\nwhere E = E1 \u2212 E2 . The physical effects of the two\ncoupling terms in Eq. (4.54) are quite different. The\n\"transverse\" coupling term proportional to \u03bb\u22a5 induces\ninterlevel transitions and eventually leads to the relaxation. The \"longitudinal\" coupling term proportional to\n\u03bbz commutes with the qubit Hamiltonian and thus does\nnot induce interlevel transitions. However, it randomly\nchanges the level spacing, which eventually leads to the\nloss of phase coherence, dephasing.

(4.51) is the stationary solution of the Liouville equation. The evolution of an arbitrary density matrix, off-diagonal in the energy eigenbasis, is given by the equations,\n\u03c11 , \u03c12 = const, \u03c112 \u221d ei(E1 \u2212E2 )t/h\u0304 .\n\nprocesses, relaxation and dephasing, are referred to as\ndecoherence.\nCoupling to the environment leads, in the simplest\ncase, to the following modification of the Liouville\nequation83,84 ,\n\nThis equation is known as the Bloch-Redfield equation. The first equation describes relaxation of the\n(0)\n=\nlevel population to the equilibrium form, \u03c1z\n\u2212(1/2) tanh(E/2kT ), T1 being the relaxation time. The\nsecond equation describes disappearance of the offdiagonal matrix element during characteristic time T2 ,\ndephasing.\nThe relaxation time is determined by the spectral density of the environmental fluctuations at the qubit frequency,\n1\n\u03bb2\n= \u22a5 S\u03c6 (\u03c9 = E).\nT1\n2\n\n(4.57)\n\nThe particular form of the spectral density depends on\nthe properties of the environment, which are frequently\nexpressed via the impedance (response function) of the\nenvironment. The most common environment consists\nof a pure resistance, in this case, S\u03c6 (\u03c9) \u221d \u03c9, at low\nfrequencies.\nThe dephasing time consists of two parts,\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n.\nT2\n2T1\nT\u03c6\n\n(4.58)\n\nThe first part is generated by the relaxation process,\nwhile the second part results from the pure dephasing due\nto the longitudinal coupling to the environment.

The superconducting leads are indicated with dark\ncolor, and the tunnel junction with light color.\n\nwhich are used as building blocks in qubit applications.\nThese basic circuits are: single current biased Josephson junction; single Josephson junction (JJ) included in\na superconducting loop (rf SQUID); two Josephson junctions included in a superconducting loop (dc SQUID);\nand an ultra-small superconducting island connected to\na massive superconducting electrode via tunnel Josephson junction (Single Cooper pair Box, SCB).\nA.\n\nCurrent biased Josephson junction\n\nThe simplest superconducting circuit, shown in Fig. 7,\nconsists of a tunnel junction with superconducting electrodes, a tunnel Josephson junction, connected to a current source. An equivalent electrical circuit, which represents the junction consists of the three lumped elements\nconnected in parallel: the junction capacitance C, the\njunction resistance R, which generally differs from the\nnormal junction resistance RN and strongly depends on\ntemperature and applied voltage, and the Josephson element associated with the tunneling through the junction.\nThe current-voltage relations for the junction capacitance and resistance have standard forms, IC =\nC (dV /dt), and IR = V /R. To write down a similar relation for the Josephson element, it is necessary to introduce the superconducting phase difference \u03c6(t) across the\njunction, often simply referred to as the superconducting\nphase, which is related to the voltage drop across the\njunction,\nZ\n2e\nV dt + \u03c6,\n(5.1)\n\u03c6(t) =\nh\u0304\nwhere \u03c6 is the time-independent part of the phase difference. The phase difference can be also related to a\nmagnetic flux,\n\u03c6=\n\n\u03a6\n2e\n\u03a6 = 2\u03c0 ,\nh\u0304\n\u03a60\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere \u03a60 = h/2e is the magnetic flux quantum. The\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere Ic is the critical Josephson current, i.e.\nthe maximum non-dissipative current that may flow\nthrough the junction.\nThe microscopic theory of\nsuperconductivity111,112,113 gives the following equation\nfor the Josephson current,\nIc =\n\n\u03c0\u2206\n\u2206\ntanh\n,\n2eRN\n2T\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere \u2206 is the superconducting order parameter, and T\nis the temperature. Using these relations and expressing\nvoltage through the superconducting phase, we can write\ndown Kirchhoff's rule for the circuit,\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\n\u03c6\u0307 + Ic sin \u03c6 = Ie ,\nC \u03c6\u0308 +\n2e\n2eR\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere Ie is the bias current. This equation describes the\ndynamics of the phase, and it has the form of a damped\nnon-linear oscillator. The role of the non-linear inductance is here played by the Josephson element.\nThe dissipation determines the qubit lifetime, and\ntherefore circuits suitable for qubit applications must\nhave extremely small dissipation. Let us assume zero\nlevel of the dissipation, dropping the resistive term in\nEq. (5.5). Then the circuit dynamic equations, using the\nmechanical analogy, can be presented in the Lagrangian\nform, and, equivalently, in the Hamiltonian form. The\ncircuit Lagrangian consists of the difference between the\nkinetic and potential energies, the electrostatic energy of\nthe junction capacitors playing the role of kinetic energy,\nwhile the energy of the Josephson current plays the role\nof potential energy.\nThe kinetic energy corresponding to the first term in\nthe Kirchhoff equation (5.5) reads,\n\u0012 \u00132\nh\u0304\nC \u03c6\u03072\nK(\u03c6\u0307) =\n.\n(5.6)\n2e\n2\nThis energy is equal to the electrostatic energy of the\njunction capacitor, CV 2 /2. It is convenient to introduce\nthe charging energy of the junction capacitor charged\nwith one electron pair (Cooper pair),\nEC =\n\n(2e)2\n,\n2C\n\n(5.7)\n\nin which case Eq. (5.6) takes the form\nK(\u03c6\u0307) =\n\nh\u03042 \u03c6\u03072\n.\n4EC\n\n(5.8)\n\nThe potential energy corresponds to the last two terms\nin Eq. (5.5), and consists of the energy of the Josephson\ncurrent, and the magnetic energy of the bias current,\nU (\u03c6) = EJ (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6) \u2212\n\nh\u0304\nIe \u03c6,\n2e\n\n(5.9)\n\n\f13\nwhere EJ = h\u0304/2e Ic is the Josephson energy. This potential energy has a form of a washboard (see Fig. 7). In\nthe absence of bias current this potential corresponds to\na pendulum with the frequency of small-amplitude oscillations given by\nr\n2eIc\n\u03c9J =\n.\n(5.10)\nh\u0304C\nThis frequency is known as the plasma frequency of the\nJosephson junction. When current bias is applied, the\npendulum potential becomes tilted, its minima becoming more shallow, and finally disappearing when the bias\ncurrent becomes equal to the critical current, Ie = IC .\nAt this point, the plasma oscillations become unstable,\nwhich physically corresponds to switching to the dissipative regime and the voltage state.\nNow we are ready to write down the Lagrangian for\nthe circuit, which is the difference between the kinetic\nand potential energies. Combining Eqs. (5.8) and (5.9),\nwe get,\nL(\u03c6, \u03c6\u0307) =\n\nh\u03042 \u03c6\u03072\nh\u0304\n\u2212 EJ (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6) + Ie \u03c6.\n4EC\n2e\n\n\u03a6\n\n(5.12)\n\nIt is important to emphasize, that the resistance of\nthe junction can only be neglected for low temperatures,\nand also only for slow time evolution of the phase; both\nthe temperature and the characteristic frequency must be\nsmall compared to the magnitude of the energy gap in the\nsuperconductor: T, h\u0304\u03c9 \u226a \u2206. The physical reason behind\nthis constraint concerns the amount of generated quasiparticle excitations in the system: if the constraint is\nfulfilled, the amount of equilibrium and non-equilibrium\nexcitations will be exponentially small. Otherwise, the\ngap in the spectrum will not play any significant role,\ndissipation becomes large, and the advantage of the superconducting state compared to the normal conducting\nstate will be lost.\n\nU(\u03c6)\n\n0\n\nrf-SQUID\n\nThe rf-SQUID is the next important superconducting\ncircuit.

The new physical feature here,\ncompared to a single current-biased junction, is the dependence of the effective Josephson energy of the double\njunction on the magnetic flux threading the SQUID loop.\nLet us evaluate the effective Josephson energy. Now\nthe circuit has two dynamical variables, superconducting\nphases, \u03c61,2 across the two Josephson junctions. Defining phases as shown in the figure, and applying considerations from Sections V A and V B we find for the static\nJosephson currents,\n(5.18)\n\nwhere Ie is the biasing current. Let us further assume\nsmall inductance of the SQUID loop and neglect the magnetic energy of circulating currents. Then the total voltage drop over the two junctions is zero, V1 + V2 = 0, and\ntherefore, \u03c61 + \u03c62 = \u03c6e , where \u03c6e is the biasing phase\nrelated to biasing magnetic flux.

This property of\nthe SQUID is used in qubit applications for controlling\nthe Josephson coupling, and also for measuring the qubit\nflux.\nThe kinetic energy of the SQUID can readily be written down noticing that it is associated with the charging\nenergy of the two junction capacitances connected in parallel,\nK(\u03c6\u0307) =\n\n\u0012\n\nh\u0304\n2e\n\n\u00132\n\n(C1 + C2 )\n\n\u03c6\u03072\n.\n2\n\n(5.25)\n\nThus the Lagrangian for the SQUID has a form similar\nto Eq.

The\nvoltage source Vg controls the gate potential. In the normal state, such a circuit is named a Single Electron Box\n(SEB)114 for the following reason: if the junction resistance exceeds the quantum resistance Rq \u2248 26 k\u03a9, and\nthe temperature is small compared to the charging energy of the island, the system is in a Coulomb blockade\nregime1,115 where the electrons can only be transferred\nto the island one by one, the number of electrons on\nthe island being controlled by the gate voltage. In the\nsuperconducting state, the same circuit is called a Single Cooper pair Box (SCB)116,117 ; for a review see the\nbook118 . An experimental SCB device is shown in Fig.\n2. In this section we consider a classical Lagrangian for\nthe circuit. Since the structure now has two capacitances,\none from the tunnel junction, C, and another one from\nthe gate, Cg , the electrostatic term in the Hamiltonian\nmust be reconsidered.\nLet us first evaluate the electrostatic energy of the\nSCB. It has the form,\nCV 2\nCg (Vg \u2212 V )2\n+\n,\n2\n2\n\n(5.27)\n\nwhere V is the voltage over the tunnel junction.

This\nsetup can be viewed as a flux-biased dc SQUID where\nJosephson junctions have very small capacitances and are\nplaced very close to each other so that the island confined\nbetween them has large charging energy. The gate electrode is connected to the island to control the charge.\n\nCombining this kinetic energy with the potential energy derived in previous subsection, we arrive at the Lagrangian of the SCB (cf. Eq. (5.28)) where both the\ncharging energy and the Josephson energy can be controlled,\n\u00132\n\u0012\nC\u03a3 h\u0304\nCg\nL=\n\u03c6\u0307\u2212 \u2212\nVg\n2\n2e\nC\u03a3\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03c6e\ncos \u03c6\u2212 .\n(5.30)\n+ 2EJ cos\n2\nVI.\n\nQUANTUM SUPERCONDUCTING\nCIRCUITS\n\nOne may look upon the Kirchhoff rules, as well as the\ncircuit Lagrangians, as the equations describing the dynamics of electromagnetic field in the presence of the\nelectric current. Generally, this electromagnetic field is a\nquantum object, and therefore there must be a quantum\ngeneralization of the equations in the previous section.\nAt first glance, the idea of quantization of an equation describing a macroscopic circuit containing a huge amount\nof electrons may seem absurd. To convince ourselves that\nthe idea is reasonable, it is useful to recall an early argument in favor of the quantization of electron dynamics\nin atoms, and to apply it to the simplest circuit, an rfSQUID: When the current oscillations are excited in the\nSQUID, it works as an antenna radiating electromagnetic\nwaves. Since EM waves are quantized, the same should\napply to the antenna dynamics.\nTo quantize the circuit equation, we follow the conventional way of canonical quantization: first we introduce\nthe Hamiltonian and then change the classical momentum to the momentum operator. The Hamiltonian is\nrelated to the Lagrangian as\nH(p, \u03c6) = p\u03c6\u0307 \u2212 L,\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere p is the canonical momentum conjugated to coordinate \u03c6,\np=\n\n\u2202L\n\u2202 \u03c6\u0307\n\n.\n\n(6.2)\n\nFor the simplest case of a single junction, Eq. (5.6), the\nmomentum reads,\n\u0012 \u00132\nh\u0304\np=\nC \u03c6\u0307.\n(6.3)\n2e\n\n\f16\nThe so defined momentum has a simple interpretation:\nit is proportional to the charge q = CV on the junction\ncapacitor, p = (h\u0304/2e)q, or the number n of electronic\npairs on the junction capacitor,\np = h\u0304n.\n\n(6.4)\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the current-biased junction has\nthe form (omitting a constant),\nH = EC n2 \u2212 EJ cos \u03c6 \u2212\n\nh\u0304\nIe \u03c6.\n2e\n\n(6.5)\n\nSimilarly, the Hamiltonian for the SQUID circuit has the\nform\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6e )2\n.\nH(n, \u03c6) = EC n2 \u2212 EJ cos \u03c6 + EL\n2\n\n(6.6)\n\nThe dc SQUID considered in the previous Section V C\nhas two degrees of freedom. The Hamiltonian can be\nwritten by generalizing Eqs. (6.5), (6.6) for the phases\n\u03c6\u00b1 . In the symmetric case we have,\nH = EC n2+ + EC n2\u2212 \u2212 2EJ cos \u03c6+ cos \u03c6\u2212\n+ EL\n\nh\u0304\n(2\u03c6+ \u2212 \u03c6e )2\n+ Ie \u03c6\u2212 .\n2\n2e\n\n(6.7)\n\nFor the SCB, Eq. (5.28), the conjugated momentum has\nthe form,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh\u0304C\u03a3 h\u0304\nCg\np=\n\u03c6\u0307 \u2212\nVg ,\n(6.8)\n2e\n2e\nC\u03a3\nand the Hamiltonian reads,\nH = EC (n \u2212 ng ) \u2212 EJ cos \u03c6,\n\n(6.9)\n\nwhere now EC = (2e)2 /2C\u03a3 , and n = p/h\u0304 has the meaning of the number of electron pairs (Cooper pairs) on the\nisland electrode. ng = \u2212Cg Vg /2e is the charge on the\ngate capacitor (in units of Cooper pairs (2e)), which can\nbe tuned by the gate potential, and which therefore plays\nthe role of external controlling parameter.\nThe quantum Hamiltonian results from Eq. (6.2) by\nsubstituting the classical momentum p for the differential\noperator,\np\u0302 = \u2212ih\u0304\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(6.10)\n\nSimilarly, one can define the charge operator,\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(6.11)\n\nand the operator of the pair number,\nn\u0302 = \u2212 i\n\n[\u03c6, n\u0302] = i.\n\n(6.13)\n\nThe meaning of the quantization procedure is the following: the phase and charge dynamical variables can\nnot be exactly determined by means of physical measurements; they are fundamentally random variables with the\nprobability of realization of certain values given by the\nmodulus square of the wave function of a particular state,\nZ\nZ\nh\u03c6i = \u03c8 \u2217 (\u03c6) \u03c6 \u03c8(\u03c6) d\u03c6, hqi = \u03c8 \u2217 (\u03c6) q\u0302 \u03c8(\u03c6) d\u03c6.\n\n(6.14)\nThe time evolution of the wave function is given by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation,\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\u03c8(\u03c6, t)\n= \u0124\u03c8(\u03c6, t)\n\u2202t\n\n(6.15)\n\nwhere H\u0304 is the circuit quantum Hamiltonian. The explicit form of the quantum Hamiltonian for the circuits\nconsidered above, is the following:\nrf-SQUID:\n\u0124 = EC n\u03022 \u2212 EJ cos \u03c6 + EL\n\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6e )2\n;\n2\n\n(6.16)\n\nh\u0304\nIe \u03c6;\n2e\n\n(6.17)\n\nCurrent biased JJ:\n\u0124 = EC n\u03022 \u2212 EJ cos \u03c6 +\ndc-SQUID:\n\n2\n\nq\u0302 = \u2212 2ei\n\nThe commutation relation between the phase operator\nand the pair number operator has a particularly simple\nform,\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(6.12)\n\n\u0124 = EC n\u03022+ + EC n\u03022\u2212 \u2212 2EJ cos \u03c6+ cos \u03c6\u2212\n+ EL\n\n(2\u03c6+ \u2212 \u03c6e )2\nh\u0304\n+ Ie \u03c6\u2212 .\n2\n2e\n\n(6.18)\n\nand finally the single Cooper pair box (SCB):\n\u0124 = EC (n\u0302 \u2212 ng )2 \u2212 EJ cos \u03c6,\n\n(6.19)\n\nFor junctions connecting macroscopically large electrodes, the charge on the junction capacitor is a continuous variable. This implies that no specific boundary\nconditions on the wave function are imposed. The situation is different for the SCB: in this case one of the\nelectrodes, the island, is supposed to be small enough\nto show pronounced charging effects. If tunneling is forbidden, electrons are trapped on the island, and their\nnumber is always integer (the charge quantization condition). However, there is a difference between the energies of even and odd numbers of electrons on the island:\nwhile an electron pair belongs to the superconducting\ncondensate and has the additional energy EC , a single\nelectron forms an excitation and thus its energy consists\nof the charging energy, EC /2 plus the excitation energy,\n\n\f17\n\u2206 (parity effect)116 . To prevent the appearance of individual electrons on the island and to provide the SCB\nregime, the condition \u2206 \u226b EC /2 must be fulfilled. Thus\nwhen the tunneling is switched on, only Josephson tunneling is allowed since it transfers Cooper pairs and the\nnumber of electrons on the island must change pairwise,\nn\u2212 = integer. In order to provide such a constraint, periodic boundary conditions on the SCB wave function are\nimposed,\n\u03c8(\u03c6) = \u03c8(\u03c6 + 2\u03c0).\n\n(6.20)\n\nThis implies that arbitrary state of the SCB is a superposition of the charge states with integer amount of the\nCooper pairs,\nX\n\u03c8(\u03c6) =\nan ein\u03c6 .\n(6.21)\nn\n\nThe uncertainty of the dynamical variables are not important as long as the relative mean deviations of dynamical variables are small, i.e. the amplitudes of the\nquantum fluctuations are small. In this case, the particle\nbehaves as a classical particle. It is known from quantum mechanics, that this corresponds to large mass of\nthe particle, in our case, to large junction capacitance.\nThus we conclude that the quantum effects in the circuit\ndynamics are essential when the junction capacitances\nare sufficiently small. The qualitative criterion is that\nthe charging energy must be larger than, or comparable\nto, the Josephson energy of the junction, EC \u223c EJ .\nTypical Josephson energies of the tunnel junctions in\nqubit circuits are of the order of a few degrees Kelvin\nor less. Bearing in mind that the insulating layers of\nthe junctions have the thickness of few atomic distances,\nand modeling the junction as a planar capacitor, the estimated junction area should be smaller than a few square\nmicrometers to observe the circuit quantum dynamics.\nOne of most important consequences of the quantum\ndynamics is quantization of the energy of the circuit. Let\nus consider, for example, the LC circuit. In the classical\ncase, the amplitude of the plasma oscillations has continuous values. In the quantum case the amplitude of\noscillation can only have certain discrete values defined\nthrough the energy spectrum of the oscillator. The linear\noscillator is well studied in the quantum mechanics, and\nits energy spectrum is very well known,\nEn = h\u0304\u03c9LC (n + 1/2), n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n(6.22)\n\nOne may ask, why is quantum dynamics never observed in ordinary electrical circuits? After all, in highfrequency applications, frequencies up to THz are available, which corresponds to a distance between the quantized oscillator levels of order 10K, which can be observed\nat sufficiently low temperature. For an illuminative discussion on this issue see the paper by Martinis, Devoret\nand Clarke123 . According to Ref. 2 it is the dissipation\nthat kills quantum fluctuations: as known from classical mechanics, the dissipation (normal resistance) broadens the resonance, and good resonators must have small\n\nresonance width, \u03b3 = 1/RC compared to the resonance\nfrequency, \u03b3 \u226a \u03c9LC . It is intuitively clear that the quantization effect will be destroyed when the level broadening exceeds the level spacing. For quantum behavior of\nthe circuit, narrow resonances, \u03b3 \u226a \u03c9LC , are therefore\nessential. However, even in this case it is hard to observe the quantum dynamics in linear circuits such as\nLC-resonators123 because the expectation values of the\nlinear oscillator follow the classical time evolution. Thus\nthe presence of non-linear circuit elements is essential.\nThe linear oscillator provides the simplest example of\na quantum energy level spectrum: it only consists of discrete levels with equal distance between the levels. The\nlevel spectrum of the Josephson junction associated with\na pendulum potential is more complicated. Firstly, because of the non-linearity (non-parabolic potential wells),\nthe energy spectrum is non-equidistant (anharmonic),\nthe high-energy levels being closer to each other than the\nlow-energy levels. Moreover, for energies larger than the\namplitude of the potential (top of the barrier), EJ , the\nspectrum is continuous. Secondly, one has to take into\naccount the possibility of a particle tunneling between\nneighboring potential wells: this will produce broadening\nof the energy levels into energy bands. The level broadening is determined by the overlap of the wave function\ntails under the potential barriers, and it must be small\nfor levels lying very close to the bottom of the potential\nwells. Such a situation may only exist if the level spacing, given by the plasma frequency of the tunnel junction\nis much smaller than the Josephson energy, h\u0304\u03c9J \u226a EJ ,\ni.e. when EC \u226a EJ . This almost classical regime with\nJosephson tunneling dominating over charging effects, is\ncalled the phase regime, because phase fluctuations are\nsmall and the superconducting phase is well defined. In\nthe opposite case, EC \u226b EJ , the lowest energy level lies\nwell above the potential barrier, and this situation corresponds to wide energy bands separated by small energy\ngaps. In this case, the wave function far from the gap\nedges can be well approximated with a plane wave,\n\u03c8q (\u03c6) = exp\n\niq\u03c6\n.\n2e\n\n(6.23)\n\nThis wave function corresponds to an eigenstate of the\ncharge operator with well defined value of the charge, q.\nSuch a regime with small charge fluctuations is called the\ncharge regime.\nVII.\n\nBASIC QUBITS\n\nThe quantum superconducting circuits considered\nabove contain a large number of energy levels, while for\nqubit operation only two levels are required. Moreover,\nthese two qubit levels must be well decoupled from the\nother levels in the sense that transitions between qubit\nlevels and the environment must be much less probable\nthan the transitions between the qubit levels itself. Typically that means that the qubit should involve a low-lying\n\n\f18\npair of levels, well separated from the spectrum of higher\nlevels, and not being close to resonance with any other\ntransitions.\n\nA.\n\nSingle Josephson Junction (JJ) qubit\n\nThe simplest qubit realization is a current biased JJ\nwith large Josephson energy compared to the charging\nenergy. In the classical regime, the particle representing\nthe phase either rests at the bottom of one of the wells of\nthe \"washboard\" potential (Fig. 7), or oscillates within\nthe well. Due to the periodic motion, the average voltage\nacross the junction is zero, \u03c6\u0307 = 0. Strongly excited states,\nwhere the particle may escape from the well, correspond\nto the dissipative regime with non-zero average voltage\nacross the junction, \u03c6\u0307 6= 0.\nIn the quantum regime described by the Hamiltonian\n(6.5),\n\nFIG. 13: Quantized energy levels in the potential of a current\nbiased Josephson Junction\n\n\u221a\nwhere Umax = 2 2(\u03a60 /2\u03c0)(1 \u2212 Ie /Ic )3/2 is the height of\nthe potential barrier at given bias current.\nB.\n\nh\u0304\n\u0124 = EC n\u03022 \u2212 EJ cos \u03c6 \u2212 Ie \u03c6,\n2e\n\n(7.1)\n\nparticle confinement, rigorously speaking, is impossible because of macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT)\nthrough the potential barrier, see Fig. 13. However,\nthe probability of MQT is small and the tunneling may\nbe neglected if the particle energy is close to the bottom of the local potential well, i.e. when E \u226a EJ . To\nfind the conditions for such a regime, it is convenient\nto approximate the potential with a parabolic function,\nU (\u03c6) \u2248 (1/2)EJ cos \u03c60 (\u03c6\u2212\u03c60 )2 , where \u03c60 corresponds to\nthe potential minimum, EJ sin \u03c60 = (h\u0304/2e)Ie . Then the\nlowest energy levels, Ek = h\u0304\u03c9p (k + 1/2) are determined\nby the plasma frequency, \u03c9p = 21/4 \u03c9J (1 \u2212 Ie /Ic )1/4 . It\nthen follows that the levels are close to the bottom of the\npotential if EC \u226a EJ , i.e. when the Josephson junction\nis in the phase regime, and moreover, if the bias current\nis not too close to the critical value, Ie < Ic .\nIt is essential for qubit operation that the spectrum in\nthe well is not equidistant. Then the two lowest energy\nlevels, k = 0, 1 can be employed for the qubit operation.\nTruncating the full Hilbert space of the junction to the\nsubspace spanned by these two states, |0i and |1i, we\nmay write the qubit Hamiltonian on the form,\n1\nHq = \u2212 \u01eb\u03c3z ,\n2\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhere \u01eb = E1 \u2212 E0 .\nThe interlevel distance is controlled by the bias current.

There are, however, specific values of the gate\nvoltage, e.g. ng = 1/2 where the charge states |0i and\n|1i become degenerate. Switching on a small Josephson\ncoupling will then lift the degeneracy, forming a tight\ntwo-level system.\nThe qubit Hamiltonian is derived by projecting the\nfull Hamiltonian (6.19) on the two charge states, |0i, |1i,\nleading to\n1\n\u0124SCB = \u2212 (\u01eb \u03c3z + \u2206 \u03c3x ),\n2\n\n(7.5)\n\nwhere \u01eb = EC (1 \u2212 2ng ), and \u2206 = EJ .

However, for the flux qubit the\ndashed lines indicate persistent current states in the absence of macroscopic tunneling, and the current degeneracy point (\u01eb = 0) corresponds to a half-integer bias flux.\nThe energy levels are controlled by the bias magnetic flux\n(instead of the gate voltage for the charge qubit).\nAt the flux degeneracy point, f = 0 (\u03c6e = \u03c0), the\nlevel spacing is determined by the small amplitude of\ntunneling through macroscopic potential barrier, and the\nwave functions correspond to the cat states, which are\nequally weighted superpositions of the flux states. Far\nfrom the degeneracy point, the qubit states are almost\npure flux states.\nThe possibility to achieve quantum coherence of\nmacroscopic current states in an rf-SQUID with a small\ncapacitance Josephson junction was first pointed out in\n1984 by Leggett122 . However, successful experimental\nobservation of the effect was achieved only in 2000 by\nFriedman et al.8 .\n2.\n\n3-junction SQUID - persistent current qubit (PCQ)\n\nThe main drawback of the flux qubit with a single\nJosephson junction (rf-SQUID) described above concerns\nthe large inductance of the qubit loop, the energy of\nwhich must be comparable to the Josephson energy to\nform the required double-well potential profile. This implies large size of the qubit loop, which makes the qubit\nvulnerable to dephasing by magnetic fluctuations of the\nenvironment. One way to overcome this difficulty was\npointed out by Mooij et al.6 , replacing the large loop inductance by the Josephson inductance of an additional\ntunnel junction, as shown in Fig. 18, The design employs\nthree tunnel junctions connected in series in a superconducting loop. The inductive energy of the loop is chosen\nto be much smaller than the Josephson energy of the\njunctions. The two junctions are supposed to be identical while the third junction is supposed to have smaller\narea, and therefore smaller Josephson and larger charging\nenergy.

Let us suppose that the qubit\nis biased at half integer flux quantum, \u03c6e = \u03c0. Then\nintroducing new variables, \u03c6\u00b1 = (\u03c61 \u00b1 \u03c62 )/2, we have\nU (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ) = \u2212EJ [2 cos \u03c6\u2212 cos \u03c6+ \u2212 (1/2 + \u03b5) cos 2\u03c6+ ].\n(7.21)\nThe potential landscape is shown in Fig. 19, and the\nqubit potential consists of the double well structure near\nthe points (\u03c6+ , \u03c6\u2212 ) = (0, 0).

The\namplitude of the structure is given by the parameter\n\u01ebEJ , and for \u01eb \u226a 1 the tunneling between these wells\ndominates. Thus this qubit is qualitatively similar to\nthe single-junction qubit described above, but the quantitative parameters are different and can be significantly\noptimized.\n\n\f22\nD.\n\nPotential qubits\n\nThe superconducting qubits that have been discussed\nin previous sections exploit the fundamental quantum uncertainty between electric charge and magnetic flux. This\nuncertainty appears already in the dynamics of a single\nJosephson junction (JJ), which is the basis for elementary\nJJ qubits. There are however other possibilities. One of\nthem is to delocalize quantum information in a JJ network by choosing global quantum states of the network\nas a computational basis. Recently, some rather complicated JJ networks have been discussed, which have\nthe unusual property of degenerate ground state, which\nmight be employed for efficient qubit protection against\ndecoherence124,125 .\nAn alternative possibility of further miniaturization\nof superconducting qubits could be to replace the standard Josephson junction by a quantum point contact\n(QPC), using the microscopic conducting modes in the\nJJ QPC, the bound Andreev states, as a computational\nbasis, allowing control of intrinsic decoherence inside the\njunction105,126 .\nTo explain the physics of this type of qubit, let us\nconsider an rf SQUID (see Fig. 8) with a junction that\nhas such a small cross section that the quantization of\nelectronic modes in the (transverse) direction perpendicular to the current flow becomes pronounced. In such a\njunction, quantum point contact (QPC), the Josephson\ncurrent is carried by a number of independent conducting electronic modes, each of which can be considered an\nelementary microscopic Josephson junction characterized\nby its own transparency. The number of modes is proportional to the ratio of the junction cross section and the\narea of the atomic cell (determined by the Fermi wavelength) of the junction material. In atomic-sized QPCs\nwith only a few conducting modes, the Josephson current\ncan be appreciable if the conducting modes are transparent (open modes). If the junction is fully transparent\n(reflectivity R = 0) then current is a well defined quantity. This will correspond to a persistent current with\ncertain direction circulating in the qubit loop. On the\nother hand, for a finite reflectivity (R 6= 0), the electronic\nback scattering will induce hybridization of the persistent\ncurrent states giving rise to strong quantum fluctuation\nof the current.\nSuch a quantum regime is distinctly different from the\nmacroscopic quantum coherent regime of the flux qubit\ndescribed in Section VII, where the quantum hybridization of the persistent current states is provided by charge\nfluctuations on the junction capacitor. Clearly, charging\neffects will not play any essential role in quantum point\ncontacts, and the leading role belongs to the microscopic\nmechanism of electron back scattering. This mechanism\nis only pronounced in quantum point contacts: in classical (large area) contacts, such as junctions of macroscopic\nqubits with areas of several square micrometers, the current is carried by a large number (> 104 ) of statistically\nindependent conducting modes, and fluctuation of the\n\n\u2206\nE\n\n1\n\n2 R\u2206\n\n0\n\n\u2206\n\n\u22121\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03c6\n\n1\n\n2\u03c0\n2\n\nFIG. 20: Energy spectrum of microscopic bound Andreev levels; the level splitting is determined by the conact reflectivity.\n\nnet Josephson current is negligibly small.\nIn QPCs, the Josephson effect is associated with microscopic Andreev levels, localized in the junction area,\nwhich transport Cooper pairs from one junction electrode\nto the other127,128 . As shown in Fig. 20, the Andreev\nlevels, two levels per conducting mode, lie within the superconducting gap and have the phase-dependent energy\nspectrum,\nq\nEa = \u00b1\u2206 cos2 (\u03c6/2) + R sin2 (\u03c6/2),\n(7.23)\n\n(here \u2206 is the superconducting order parameter in the\njunction electrodes). For very small reflectivity, R \u226a 1,\nand phase close to \u03c0 (half integer flux bias) the Andreev two-level system is well isolated from the continuum states. The expectation value for the Josephson\ncurrent carried by the level is determined by the Andreev\nlevel spectrum,\nIa =\n\n2e dEa\n,\nh\u0304 d\u03c6e\n\n(7.24)\n\nand it has different sign for the upper and lower level.\nSince the state of the Andreev two-level system is determined by the phase difference and related to the Josephson current, the state can be manipulated by driving\nmagnetic flux through the SQUID loop, and read out\nby measuring circulating persistent current129,130 .\nThis microscopic physics underlines recent proposal for\nAndreev level qubit105,126 . The qubit is similar to the\nmacroscopic flux qubits with respect to how it is manipulated and measured, but the great difference is that the\nquantum information is stored in the microscopic quantum states. This difference is reflected in the more complex form of the qubit Hamiltonian, which consists of\nthe two-level Hamiltonian of the Andreev levels strongly\ncoupled to the quantum oscillator describing phase fluctuations,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\u0124 = \u2206 e\u2212i\u03c3x R \u03c6/2 cos \u03c3z + R sin \u03c3y + \u0124osc [\u03c6],\n2\n2\n(7.25)\n\n\f23\n\u0124osc [\u03c6] = EC n\u0302 + (EL /2)(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6e )2 . Comparing this equation with e.g. the SCT Hamiltonian (7.8), we find that\nthe truncated Hamiltonian of the SCB is replaced here\nby the Andreev level Hamiltonian.\n\nVIII.\n\nQUBIT READOUT AND MEASUREMENT\nOF QUANTUM INFORMATION\n\nIn this section we present a number of proposed, and\nrealized, schemes for measuring quantum states of various superconducting qubits.\n\nA.\n\nReadout: why, when and how?\n\nAs already mentioned in Section III D, the ultimate\nobjective of a qubit readout device is to distinguish the\neigenstates of a qubit in a single measurement \"without\ndestroying the qubit\", a so called \"single-shot\" quantum\nnon-demolition (QND) projective measurement. This\nobjective is essential for several reasons: state preparation for computation, readout for error correction during\nthe calculation, and readout of results at the end of the\ncalculation. Strictly speaking, the QND property is only\nneeded if the qubit must be left in an eigenstate after\nthe readout. In a broader sense, readout of a specific\nqubit must of course not destroy any other qubits in the\nsystem.\nIt must be carefully noted that one cannot \"read out\nthe state of a qubit\" in a single measurement - this is prohibited by quantum mechanics. It takes repeated measurements on a large number of replicas of the quantum\nstate to characterize the state of the qubit (Eq. (3.1)) \"quantum tomography\"131.\nThe measurement connects the qubit with the open\nsystem of the detector, which collapses the combined system of qubit and measurement device to one of its common eigenstates. If the coupling between the qubit and\nthe detector is weak, the eigenstates are approximately\nthose of the qubit. In general however, one must consider the eigenstates of the total qubit-detector system\nand manipulate gate voltages and fluxes such that the\nreadout measurement is performed in a convenient energy eigenbasis (see e.g.42,79 ).\nEven under ideal conditions, a single-shot measurement can only determine the population of an eigenstate\nif the system is prepared in an eigenstate: then the answer will always be either \"0\" or \"1\". If an ideal singleshot measurement is used to read out a qubit superposition state, e.g. during Rabi oscillation, then again the\nanswer can only be \"0\" or \"1\". To determine the qubit\npopulation (i.e. the |a1 |2 and |a2 |2 probabilities) requires\nrepetition of the measurement to obtain the expectation\nvalue. During the intermediate stages of quantum computation one must therefore not perform a measurement\non a qubit unless one knows, because of the design and\ntiming of the algorithm, that this qubit is in an energy\n\nFIG. 21: Measurement of the phase qubit. Long-living levels\nform the qubit, while the dashed line indicates a leaky level\nwith large energy.\n\neigenstate. Then the value is predetermined and the\nqubit left in the eigenstate (Stern-Gerlach-style).\nOn the other hand, to extract the desired final result it\nmay be necessary to create an ensemble of calculations to\nbe able to perform a complete measurement to determine\nthe expectation values of variables of interest, performing\nquantum state tomography131.\n\nB.\n\nDirect qubit measurement\n\nDirect destructive measurement of the qubit can be illustrated with the example of a single JJ (phase) qubit,\nSection VII A. After the manipulation has been performed (e.g. Rabi oscillation), the qubit is left in a superposition of the upper and lower energy states. To\ndetermine the probability of the upper state, one slowly\nincreases the bias current until it reaches such a value\nthat the upper energy level equals Or gets close to) the\ntop of the potential barrier, see Fig. 21. Then the junction, being at the upper energy level, will switch from the\nJosephson branch to the dissipative branch, and this can\nbe detected by measuring the finite average voltage appearing across the junction (voltage state). If the qubit\nis in the lower energy state the qubit will remain on the\nJosephson branch and a finite voltage will not be detected (zero-voltage state). An alternative method to\nactivate switching30 is to apply an rf signal with resonant frequency (instead of tilting the junction potential)\nin order to excite the upper energy level and to induce the\nswitching event, see Fig. 21 (also illustrating a standard\nreadout method in atomic physics).\nIt is obvious that, in this example, the qubit upper\nenergy state is always destroyed by the measurement.\nSingle-shot measurement is possible provided the MQT\nrate for the lower energy level is sufficiently small to\nprevent the junction switching during the measurement\ntime. It is also essential to keep a sufficiently small rate of\ninterlevel transitions induced by fluctuations of the bias\n\n\f24\nP\nt << t ms\n\nt < t ms\n\nt = t ms\n\nSCB\nt I(n0x )\n\n0\n\nt I(n1x )\n\nm\n\nSET\nFIG. 23: Probability distributions P of counted electrons as\nfunctions of time after the turning on the measurement beam\nof electrons.

Johansson, Chalmers.\n\nVg\nFIG. 22: Single Electron Transistor (SET) capacitively coupled to an SCB.\n\ncurrent and by the current ramping.\nA similar kind of direct destructive measurement was\nperformed by Nakamura et al.1 to detect the state of the\ncharge qubit. The qubit operation was performed at the\ncharge degeneracy point, ug = 1, where the level splitting\nis minimal. An applied gate voltage then shifted the SCB\nworking point (Fig. 15), inducing a large level splitting\nof the pure charge states |0i and |1i (the measurement\npreparation stage). In this process the upper |1i charge\nstate went above the threshold for Cooper pair decay,\ncreating two quasi-particles which immediately tunnel\nout via the probe junction into the leads. These quasiparticles were measured as a contribution to the classical\ncharge current by repeating the experiment many times.\nObviously, this type of measurement is also destructive.\n\ncapacitively coupled to a charge qubit has also been extensively discussed in literature132,139,140,141,142,143,144 .\nThe induced charge on the SET gate depends on the\nstate of the qubit, affecting the SET working point\nand determining the conductivity and the average current. The development of the probability distributions\nof counted electrons with time is shown in Fig. 23.\nAs the number of counted electrons grows, the distributions separate and become distinguishable, the distance\nbetween\nthe peaks developing as \u223c N and the width\n\u221a\n\u223c N . Detailed investigations144 show that the two\nelectron-number probability distributions correlate with\nthe probability of finding the qubit in either of two energy\nlevels. The long-time development depends on the intensity and frequency distribution of the back-action noise\nfrom the electron current. With very weak detector back\naction, the qubit can relax to |0i during the natural relaxation time T1 . With very strong back-action noise at\nthe qubit frequency, the qubit may become saturated in\na 50/50 mixed state.\nD.\n\nC.\n\nMeasurement of charge qubit with SET\n\nNon-destructive measurement of the charge qubit has\nbeen implemented by connecting the qubit capacitively\nto a SET electrometer69 . The idea of this method is to\nuse a qubit island as an additional SET gate (Fig. 22),\ncontrolling the dc current through the SET depending\non the state of the qubit. When the measurement is to\nbe performed, a driving voltage is applied to the SET,\nand the dc current is measured. Another version of the\nmeasurement procedure is to apply rf bias to the SET\n(rf-SET69,133,134,135 ) in Fig. 22, and to measure the dissipative or inductive response. In both cases the transmissivity will show two distinct values correlated with\nthe two states of the qubit. Yet another version has recently been developed by the NEC group136 to perform\nsingle-shot readout: the Cooper pair on the SCB island\nthen tunnels out onto a trap island (instead of the leads)\nused as a gate to control the current through the SET.\nThe physics of the SET-based readout has been extensively studied theoretically (see42,137,138 and references\ntherein). A similar idea of controlling the transmission\nof a quantum point contact (QPC) (instead of an SET)\n\nMeasurement via coupled oscillator\n\nAnother method of qubit read out that has attracted\nmuch attention concerns the measurement of the properties of a linear or non-linear oscillator coupled to a qubit.\nThis method is employed for the measurement of induced\nmagnetic flux and persistent current in the loop of flux\nqubits and charge-phase qubits, as well as for charge measurement on charge qubits. With this method, the qubit\naffects the characteristics of the coupled oscillator, e.g.\nchanges the shape of the oscillator potential, after which\nthe oscillator can be probed to detect the changes. There\nare two versions of the method: resonant spectroscopy of\na linear tank circuit/cavity, and threshold detection using biased JJ or SQUID magnetometer.\nThe first method uses the fact that the resonance frequency of a linear oscillator weakly coupled to the qubit\nundergoes a shift depending on the qubit state. The\neffect is most easily explained by considering the SCT\nHamiltonian, Eq. (11.1),\n1\n\u0124SCT = \u2212 (\u01eb\u03c3z + \u2206(\u03c6e )\u03c3x ) + \u03bb(\u03c6e )\u03c6\u0303\u03c3x\n2\n1\n+4EC \u00f1\u02c62 + EL \u03c6\u03032 .\n2\n\n(8.1)\n\n\f25\n\nVout (t)\n\nLet us proceed to the qubit energy basis, in which casee\nthe\n\u221a qubit Hamiltonian takes the form \u2212(E/2)\u03c3z , E =\n\u01eb2 + \u22062 . The interaction term in the qubit eigenbasis\nwill consist of two parts, the longitudinal part, \u03bbz \u03c6\u0303\u03c3z ,\n\u03bbz = (\u2206/E)\u03bb, and the transverse part, \u03bbx \u03c6\u0303\u03c3x , \u03bbx =\n(\u01eb/E)\u03bb. In the limit of weak coupling the transverse part\nof interaction is the most essential. In the absence of\ninteraction (\u03c6e = 0), the energy spectrum of the qubit +\noscillator system is\nEn\u2213 = \u2213\n\nE\n1\n+ h\u0304\u03c9(n + ),\n2\n2\n\n\u03bb2x h\u0304\u03c9\n.\nEL (h\u0304\u03c9 \u2212 E)\n\n(8.3)\n\nThis shift is proportional to the first power of the oscillator quantum number n, which implies that the oscillator\nfrequency acquires a shift (the frequency of the qubit is\nalso shifted145,146,147,148,149 ). Since the sign of the oscillator frequency shift is different for the different qubit\nstates, it is possible to distinguish the state of the qubit\nby probing this frequency shift.\nIn the case of the SCT, the LC oscillator is a generic\npart of the circuit. It is equally possible to use an additional LC oscillator inductively coupled to a qubit. This\ntype of device has been described by Zorin71 for SCT\nreadout, and recently implemented for flux qubits by\nIl'ichev et al.27,39 .\nFigure 24 illustrates another case, namely a charge\nqubit capacitively coupled to an oscillator, again providing energy resolution for discriminating the two qubit\nlevels150 . Analysis of this circuit is similar to the one discussed below in the context of qubit coupling via oscillators, Section IX. The resulting Hamiltonian is similar to\nEq. (9.20), namely,\n\u0124 = \u0124SCB + \u03bb\u03c3y \u03c6 + \u0124osc .\n\n(8.4)\n\nIn comparison with the case of the SCT, Eq. (8.4) has\na different form of the coupling term, which does not\nchange during rotation to the qubit eigenbasis. Therefore the coupling constant \u03bb directly enters Eq. (8.3).\nRecently, this type of read out has been implemented for\na charge qubit by capacitively coupling the SCB of the\nqubit to a superconducting strip resonator151,152,153 .\nE.\n\nSCB\n\n(8.2)\n\n\u221a\nwhere h\u0304\u03c9 = 8EC EL is the plasma frequency of the\noscillator. The effect of weak coupling is enhanced in\nthe vicinity of the resonance, when the oscillator plasma\nfrequency is close to the qubit level spacing, h\u0304\u03c9 \u2248 E. Let\nus assume, however, that the coupling energy is smaller\nthan the deviation from the resonance, \u03bbx \u226a |h\u0304\u03c9 \u2212 E|.\nThen the spectrum of the interacting system in the lowest\nperturbative order will acquire a shift,\n\u03b4En\u00b1 = \u00b1 (n + 1)\n\nu(t)\n\nThreshold detection\n\nTo illustrate the threshold-detection method, let us\nconsider an SCT qubit with a third Josephson junction\n\nVg\nFIG. 24: SCT qubit coupled to a readout oscillator. The\nqubit is operated by input pulses u(t). The readout oscillator\nis controlled and driven by ac microwave pulses Vg (t). The\noutput signal will be ac voltage pulses Vout(t), the amplitude\nor phase of which may discriminate between the qubit \"0\"\nand \"1\" states.\n\nSCT\n\nIb\n\nVg\nFIG. 25: SCT qubit coupled to a JJ readout quantum oscillator. The JJ oscillator is controlled by dc/ac current pulses\nIb (t) adding to the circulating currents in the loop due to the\nSCT qubit. The output will be dc/ac voltage pulses Vout (t)\ndiscriminating between the qubit \"0\" and \"1\" states.\n\ninserted in the qubit loop, as shown in Fig. 25.\nWhen the measurement of the qubit state is to be performed, a bias current is sent through the additional junction. This current is then added to the qubit-state dependent persistent current circulating in the qubit loop. If\nthe qubit and readout currents flow in the same direction,\nthe critical current of the readout JJ is exceeded, which\ninduces the junction switching to the resistive branch,\nsending out a voltage pulse. This effect is used to distinguish the qubit states. The method has been extensively\nused experimentally by Vion et al.21,22,23 .\nTo describe the circuit, we add the Lagrangian of a\nbiased JJ, Eq. (5.11),\nL=\n\nh\u03042 \u03c6\u03072\nh\u0304\nm\nm + EJ cos \u03c6 + 2e Ie \u03c6,\n4EC\n\n(8.5)\n\n\f26\nto the SCT Lagrangian (generalized Eq. (5.30), cf.

The phase\nquantization condition will now read: 2\u03c6+ + \u03c6 = \u03c6e + \u03c6\u0303.\nThe measurement junction will be assumed in the phase\nm\nregime, EJm \u226b EC\n, and moreover, the inductive energy\nwill be the largest energy in the circuit, EL \u226b EJm . The\nlatter implies that the induced phase is negligibly small\nand can be dropped from the phase quantization condition. We also assume that \u03c6e = 0, thus 2\u03c6+ + \u03c6 = 0.\nThen, after having omitted the variable \u03c6+ , the kinetic\nenergy term of the qubit can be combined with the much\nlarger kinetic energy of the measurement junction leading to insignificant renormalization of the measurement\njunction capacitance, C m + C/4 \u2192 C m . As a result, the\ntotal Hamiltonian of the circuit will take the form,\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03c6\n2\n\u0124 = EC (n\u0302\u2212 \u2212 ng ) \u2212 2EJ cos\ncos \u03c6\u2212\n2\nh\u0304\nm 2\n+EC\nn\u0302 \u2212 EJm cos \u03c6 \u2212 Ie \u03c6.\n(8.7)\n2e\nSince the measurement junction is supposed to be almost\nclassical, its phase is fairly close to the minimum of the\njunction potential. During qubit operation, the bias current is zero; hence the phase of the measurement junction\nis zero. When the measurement is made, the current is\nramped to a large value close to the critical current of\nthe measurement junction, Ie = (2e/h\u0304)EJm \u2212 \u03b4I, tilting\nthe junction potential and shifting the minimum towards\n\u03c0/2. Introducing a new variable \u03c6 = \u03c0 + \u03b8, we expand\nthe potential with respect to small \u03b8 \u226a 1 and, truncating\nthe qubit part, we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b8\n\u2206\n\u01eb\n1\u2212\n\u03c3x\n\u0124 = \u2212 \u03c3z \u2212\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b83\nh\u0304\nm 2\n+EC\nn\u0302 \u2212 EJm + \u03b4I \u03b8,\n(8.8)\n6\n2e\n\u221a\nwhere \u2206 = 2 E J . The ramping is supposed to be adiabatic so that the phase remains at the minimum point.\nLet us analyze the behavior of the potential minimum\nby omitting a small kinetic term and diagonalizing the\nHamiltonian (8.8). The corresponding eigenenergies depend on \u03b8,\n\u0013\n\u0012\n3\n\u22062\nE\nh\u0304\nm\u03b8\n\u03b8,\n(8.9)\n+\n\u03b4I \u00b1\nE\u00b1 (\u03b8) = \u2213 \u2212 EJ\n2\n6\n2e\n4E\nas shown in Fig. 26. Then within the interval of the bias\ncurrents, |\u03b4I| \u2264 \u2212(2e/h\u0304)(\u22062 /4E), the potential energy\ncorresponding to the ground state has a local minimum,\n\n\u03b8\nFIG. 26: Josephson potential energy of the measurement\njunction during the measurement: for the \"0\" qubit eigenstate there is a well (full line) confining a level, while for the\n\"1\" qubit state there is no well (dashed line).\n\nwhile for the excited state it does not. This implies that\nwhen the junction is in the ground state, no voltage will\nbe generated. However, if the junction is in the excited\nstate, it will switch to the resistive branch, generating a\nvoltage pulse that can be detected.\nWith the discussed setup the direction of the persistent current is measured. It is also possible to arrange\nthe measurement of the flux by using a dc SQUID as a\nthreshold detector. Such a setup is suitable for the measurement of flux qubits. Let us consider, for example, the\nthree junction flux qubit from Section VII C inductively\ncoupled to a dc SQUID. Then, under certain assumptions, the Hamiltonian of the system can be reduced to\nthe following form:\n1\n\u0124 = \u2212 (\u01eb\u03c3z + \u2206\u03c3x )\n2\nh\u0304\ns\n+EC\nn\u03022 \u2212 (EJs + \u03bb\u03c3z ) cos \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b4I \u03c6,\n2e\n\n(8.10)\n\nwhere EJs is an effective (bias flux dependent) Josephson\nenergy of the SQUID, Eq. (5.24), and \u03bb is an effective\ncoupling constant proportional to the mutual inductance\nof the qubit and the SQUID loops.\nIX.\n\nPHYSICAL COUPLING SCHEMES FOR\nTWO QUBITS\nA.\n\nGeneral principles\n\nA generic scheme for coupling qubits is based on\nthe physical interaction of linear and non-linear oscillators constituting a superconducting circuit. The\nHamiltonians for the SCB, rf-SQUID, and plain JJ contain quadratic terms representing the kinetic and potential energies plus the non-linear Josephson energy term,\nwhich is quadratic when expanded to lowest order,\n\u0124 = EC (n\u0302 \u2212 ng )2 + EJ (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6)\n\n(9.1)\n\n\f27\n\nSCB\n\nSCB\n\nC3\nVg\n\nVg\n\nFIG. 27: Fixed inductive (flux) coupling of elementary flux\nqubit.

The energy of the\nsystem can therefore not be described as the sum of two\nindependent qubits because of the quadratic dependence,\nand the cross terms represent interaction energies of different kinds: capacitive, inductive and phase/current.\nMoreover, using JJ circuits as non-linear coupling elements we have the advantage that the direct physical\ncoupling strength may be controlled, e.g tuning the inductance via current biased JJs, or tuning the capacitance by a voltage biased SCB.\n\u0124 = EC n\u03022 + EJ (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6) +\n\nB.\n\nInductive coupling of flux qubits\n\nA common way of coupling flux qubits is the inductive\ncoupling: magnetic flux induced by one qubit threads\nthe loop of another qubit, changing the effective external\nflux. This effect is taken into account by introducing the\ninductance matrix Lik , which connects flux in the i-th\nloop with the current circulating in the k-th loop,\nX\n\u03a6i =\nLik Ik .\n(9.4)\nk\n\nThe off-diagonal element of this matrix, L12 , is the mutual inductance which is responsible for the interaction.\nBy using the inductance matrix, the magnetic part of the\npotential energy in Eq. (6.16) can be generalized to the\ncase of two coupled qubits,\n\u0012 \u00132 X\n1 h\u0304\n(L\u22121 )ik (\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6ei )(\u03c6k \u2212 \u03c6ek ).\n(9.5)\n2 2e\nik\n\nThen following the truncation procedure explained in\nSection VII C, we calculate the matrix elements,\nhl|\u03c6\u0303 \u2212 f |li, hr|\u03c6\u0303 \u2212 f |ri, hl|\u03c6\u0303 \u2212 f |ri,\n\n(9.6)\n\nfor each qubit. The last matrix element is exponentially\nsmall, while the first two ones are approximately equal to\nthe minimum points of the potential energy, \u03c6l and \u03c6r ,\nrespectively. This implies that the truncated interaction\nbasically has the zz-form,\n\u0124int = \u03bb\u03c3z1 \u03c3z2 ,\n1\n\u03bb=\n8\nC.\n\n\u0012\n\nh\u0304\n2e\n\n\u00132\n\n(L\u22121 )12 (\u03c6l \u2212 \u03c6r )1 (\u03c6l \u2212 \u03c6r )2 .\n\n(9.7)\n\nCapacitive coupling of charge qubits\n\nOne of the simplest coupling schemes is the capacitive\ncoupling of charge qubits. Such a coupling is realized by\nconnecting the islands of two SCBs via a small capacitor,\nas illustrated in Fig. 28. This will introduce an additional term in the Lagrangian of the two non-interacting\nSCBs, Eq.

Such schemes provide more\nflexibility, e.g. to control qubit interaction, to couple two\nremote qubits, and to connect several qubits. Moreover,\nin many advanced qubits, the qubit variables are generically connected to the outside world via an oscillator (e.g.\nthe Delft and Saclay qubits). To explain the principles\nof such a coupling, we consider the coupling scheme for\ncharge qubits suggested by Shnirman et al.14 .\n\n1.\n\nCoupling of charge (SCB, SCT) qubits\n\nIn this circuit the island of each SCB is connected to\nground via a common LC-oscillator, as illustrated in Fig.\n31.

If the plasma frequency of the\nLC oscillator is much larger than the frequencies of all\nqubits, then virtual excitation of the oscillator will produce a direct effective qubit-qubit coupling, the oscillator\nstaying in the ground state during all qubit operations.\nTo provide a small amplitude of the zero-point fluctuations, the oscillator plasma frequency should be small\ncompared to the inductive energy, or ECosc \u226a EL .

(7.7), (7.8), for each qubit,\n\u0124SCT = EC (n\u0302\u2212 \u2212 ng )2 + EC n\u03022+\n\u22122EJ cos \u03c6+ cos \u03c6\u2212 + EL\n\n(2\u03c6+ \u2212 \u03c6e )2\n,\n2\n\n(9.24)\n\nand adding the Hamiltonian of the coupling junction,\n\u0124c = EC,c n\u03022c \u2212 EJ,c cos \u03c6c .\n\n(9.25)\n\nThe phase \u03c6c across the coupling junction must be added\nto the flux quantization condition in each qubit loop;\ne.g., for the first qubit 2\u03c6+,1 + \u03c6c = \u03c6e,1 + \u03c6\u03031 (for the\nsecond qubit the sign of \u03c6c will be minus). Assuming\nsmall inductive energy, EL \u226a EJ,c , we may neglect \u03c6\u0303;\nthen assuming the flux regime for the coupling Josephson junction we adopt a parabolic approximation for the\njunction potential, EJ,c \u03c62c /2.\n\n\f30\nWith these approximations, the Hamiltonian of the\nfirst qubit plus coupling junction will a take form similar to Eq. (9.24) where EJ,c will substitute for EL , and\n\u03c6c will substitute for2\u03c6+ \u2212 \u03c6e . Finally assuming the amplitude of the \u03c6c -oscillations to be small, we proceed as\nin the previous subsection, i.e. expand the cosine term\nobtaining linear coupling between the SCB and the oscillator, truncate the full Hamiltonian, and average out the\noscillator. This will yield the following interaction term,\n\u03c6i\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2\n\u03c3x1 \u03c3x2 , \u03bbi = EJ sin\nEJ,c\n2\n\n\u0124int =\n\n(9.26)\n\nThis coupling scheme also applies to flux qubits: in this\ncase, the coupling will have the same form as in Eq. (9.7),\nbut the strength will be determined by the Josephson\nenergy of the coupling junction, cf. Eq. (9.26), rather\nthan by the mutual inductance.\n\nG.\n\nVariable coupling schemes\n\nComputing with quantum gate networks basically assumes that one-and two-qubit gates can be turned on\nand off at will. This can be achieved by tuning qubits\nwith fixed, finite coupling in and out of resonance, in\nNMR-style computing162 .\nHere we shall discuss an alternative way, namely\nto vary the strength of the physical coupling between\nnearest-neighbour qubits, as discussed in a number of recent papers155,156,158,159,160,163,164,165,166 .\n\n1.\n\nVariable inductive coupling\n\nTo achieve variable inductive coupling of flux qubits\none has to be able to the control the mutual inductance\nof the qubit loops. This can be done by different kinds\nof controllable switches (SQUIDS, transistors)163 in the\ncircuit. In a recent experiment, a variable flux transformer was implemented as a coupling element (see Fig.\n33) by controlling the transforming ratio167 . The flux\ntransformer is a superconducting loop strongly inductively coupled to the qubit loops, which are distant from\neach other so that the direct mutual qubit inductance is\nnegligibly small. Because of the effect of quantization of\nmagnetic flux in the transformer loop112 , the local variation of magnetic flux \u03a61 induced by one qubit will affect a local magnetic flux \u03a62 in the vicinity of the other\nqubit creating effective qubit-qubit coupling. When a dc\nSQUID is inserted in the transformer loop, as shown in\nFig. 33, it will shortcircuit the transformer loop, and the\ntransformer ratio \u03a62 /\u03a61 will change. The effect depends\non the current flowing through the SQUID, and is proportional to the critical current of the SQUID. The latter is\ncontrolled by applying a magnetic flux \u03a6cx to the SQUID\nloop, as explained in Section V C and shown in Fig. 33.\nQuantitatively, the dependence of the transformer ratio\n\nFIG. 33: Flux transformer with variable coupling controlled\nby a SQUID.\n\non the controlling flux is given by the equation167 ,\n\u03a62\n=\n\u03a61\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\u0012\nEJ\n\u03c0\u03a6cx\n1+\ncos\n,\nEL\n\u03a60\n\n(9.27)\n\nwhere EJ is the Josephson energy of the SQUID junction,\nand EL is the inductive energy of the transformer.\n\n2.\n\nVariable Josephson coupling\n\nA variable Josephson coupling is obtained when a single Josephson junction is substituted by a symmetric dc\nSQUID whose effective Josephson energy 2EJ cos(\u03c6e /2)\ndepends on the magnetic flux threading the SQUID loop\n(see the discussion in Section V C). This property is\ncommonly used to control level spacing in both flux and\ncharge qubits introduced in Section V D, and it can also\nbe used to switch on and off qubit-qubit couplings. For\nexample, the coupling of the charge-phase qubits via\nJosephson junction in Fig. 32 can be made variable\nby substituting the single coupling junction with a dc\nSQUID155,156 .\nThe coupling scheme discussed in Section IX F 1 is\nmade controllable by using a dc SQUID design for the\nSCB as explained in Section V D). Indeed, since the coupling strength depends on the Josephson energy of the\nqubit junction, Eq. (9.21), this solution provides variable coupling of the qubits. Similarly, the coupling of\nthe SCTs considered in Section IX F 2 can be made controllable by employing a dc SQUID as a coupling element. A disadvantage of this solution is that the qubit\nparameters will vary simultaneously with varying of the\ncoupling strength. A more general drawback of the dc\nSQUID-based controllable coupling is the necessity to\napply magnetic field locally, which might be difficult to\nachieve without disturbing other elements of the circuit.\nThis is however an experimental question, and what are\npractical solutions in the long run remains to be seen.\n\n\f31\n\nIb\n\nSCT\n\nSCT\n\nVg\n\nVg\nFIG. 35: Variable capacitance tuned by a voltage-controlled\nSCB.\n\nFIG. 34: Coupled charge qubits with current-controlled phase\ncoupling: the arrow indicates the direction of the controlling\nbias current.\n\n3.\n\nVariable phase coupling\n\nAn alternative solution for varying the coupling\nis based on the idea of controlling the properties\nof the Josephson junction by applying external dc\ncurrent158,159,160 , as illustrated in Fig. 34.\nLet us consider the coupling scheme of Section IX F 2:\nthe coupling strength here depends on the plasma frequency of the coupling Josephson junction, which in turn\ndepends on the form of the local minimum of the junction\npotential energy. This form can be changed by tilting the\njunction potential by applying external bias current (Fig.\n34), as discussed in Section V A. The role of the external phase bias, \u03c6e , will now be played by the minimum\npoint \u03c60 of the tilted potential determined by the applied\nbias current, EJ,c sin \u03c60 = (h\u0304/2e)Ie . Then the interaction\nterm will read,\n\u0124int = \u03bb\u03c3x1 \u03c3x2 , \u03bb =\n\nEJ2 sin2 (\u03c60 /2)\n,\nEJ,c cos \u03c60\n\n(9.28)\n\nand local magnetic field biasing is not required.\n4.\n\nVariable capacitive coupling\n\nVariable capacitive coupling of charge qubits based on\na quite different physical mechanism of interacting SCB\ncharges has been proposed in Ref.165 . The SCBs are then\nconnected via the circuit presented in Fig. 35.\nThe Hamiltonian of this circuit, including the charge\nqubits, has the form\nX\n\u0124SCB,i +EC (n\u0302\u2212q(n\u03021 +n\u03022 ))2 \u2212EJ cos \u03c6, (9.29)\n\u0124 =\ni\n\nwhere EC and EJ \u223c Ec are the charging and Josephson\nenergies of the coupling junction, and n\u0302 and \u03c6 are the\ncharge and the phase of the coupling junction. The function q is a linear function of the qubit charges, n\u03021 , and\n\nn\u03022 , and it also depends on the gate voltages of the qubits\nand the coupling junction. In contrast to the previous\nscheme, here the coupling junction is not supposed to be\nin the phase regime; however, it is still supposed to be\nfast, EJ \u226b EJi . Then the energy gap in the spectrum\nof the coupling junction is much bigger than the qubit\nenergy, and the junction will stay in the ground state\nduring qubit operations. Then after truncation, and averaging out the coupling junction, the Hamiltonian of the\ncircuit will take the form,\nX\n\u0124SCB,i + \u01eb0 (\u03c3z1 + \u03c3z2 ) ,\n(9.30)\n\u0124 =\ni\n\nwhere the qubit Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (7.5), and\nthe function \u01eb0 is the ground state energy of the coupling\njunction. The latter can be generally presented as a linear\ncombination of terms proportional to \u03c3z1 \u03c3z2 and \u03c3z1 +\n\u03c3z2 ,\n\u01eb0 (\u03c3z1 + \u03c3z2 ) = \u03b1 + \u03bd\u03c3z1 \u03c3z2 + \u03b2 (\u03c3z1 + \u03c3z2 ) .\n\n(9.31)\n\nwith coefficients depending on the gate potentials. The\nsecond term in this expression gives the zz-coupling (in\nthe charge basis), and the coupling constant \u03bd may, according to the analysis of Ref.165 , take on both positive\nand negative values depending on the coupling junction\ngate voltage. In particular it may turn to zero, implying\nqubit decoupling.\nH.\n\nTwo qubits coupled via a resonator\n\nIn the previous discussion, the coupling oscillator plays\na passive role, being enslaved by the qubit dynamics.\nHowever, if the oscillator is tuned into resonance with a\nqubit, then the oscillator dynamics will become essential,\nleading to qubit-oscillator entanglement. In this case,\nthe approximation of direct qubit-qubit coupling is not\nappropriate; instead, manipulations explicitly involving\nthe oscillator must be considered.\nLet us consider, as an example, operations with two\ncharge qubits capacitively coupled to the oscillator. Assuming the qubits to be biased at the degeneracy point\n\n\f32\nand proceeding to the qubit eigenbasis (phase basis in\nthis case), we write the Hamiltonian on the form (cf. Eq.\n(7.10),\n\u0013\nX \u0012 \u2206i\n\u0124 = \u2212\n\u03c3zi \u2212 \u03bbi \u03c3x \u03c6i + \u0124osc [\u03c6]. (9.32)\n2\ni=1,2\nLet us consider the following manipulation involving the\nvariation of the oscillator frequency (cf. Ref164 ): at time\nt = 0, the oscillator frequency is off-resonance with both\nqubits,\nh\u0304\u03c9(0) < \u22061 < \u22062 .\n\n(9.34)\n\nthe frequency remaining constant for a while. Then the\nfrequency is ramped again and brought into resonance\nwith the second qubit,\nh\u0304\u03c9(t2 ) = \u22062 .\n\n(9.35)\n\nFinally, after a certain time it is ramped further so that\nthe oscillator gets out of resonance with both qubits at\nthe end,\nh\u0304\u03c9(t > t3 ) > \u22062 .\n\nX.\n\nDYNAMICS OF MULTI-QUBIT SYSTEMS\nA.\n\n(9.33)\n\nThen the frequency is rapidly ramped so that the oscillator becomes resonant with the first qubit,\nh\u0304\u03c9(t1 ) = \u22061 ,\n\nThe manipulation should not necessarily be step-like, it\nis sufficient to pass the resonance rapidly enough to provide the Landau-Zener transition, i.e. the speed of the\nfrequency ramping should be comparable to the qubit\nlevel splittings.\nReferences to recent work on the entanglement of\nqubits and oscillators will be given in Section IV C.\n\n(9.36)\n\nWhen passing through the resonance, the oscillator is\nhybridized with the corresponding qubit, and after passing the resonance, the oscillator and qubit have become\nentangled. For example, let us prepare our system at\nt = 0 in the excited state \u03c8(0) = |100i = |1i|0i|0i,\nwhere the first number denotes the state of the oscillator (first excited level), and the last numbers denote the\n(ground) states of the first and second qubits, respectively. After the first operation, the oscillator will be\nentangled with the first qubit,\n\u0001\n\u03c8(t1 < t < t2 ) = cos \u03b81 |10i + sin \u03b81 ei\u03b1 |01i |0i.\n(9.37)\nAfter the second manipulation, the state |100i will be\nentangled with state |001i,\n\u0001\n\u03c8(t > t3 ) = cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 |100i + sin \u03b82 ei\u03b2 |001i\n\n+ sin \u03b81 ei\u03b1 |010i. (9.38)\n\nTo ensure that there are no more resonances during\nthe described manipulations, it is sufficient to require\nh\u0304\u03c9(0) > \u22062 \u2212 \u22061 .\nIf the controlling pulses are chosen so that \u03b82 = \u03c0/2,\nthen the initial excited state will be eliminated form the\nfinal superposition, and we'll get entangled states of the\nqubits, while the oscillator will return to the ground\nstate,\n\u0001\n\u03c8(t > t3 ) = |0i cos \u03b81 ei\u03b2 |01i) + sin \u03b81 ei\u03b1 |10i .\n(9.39)\n\nGeneral N-qubit formulation\n\nA general N-qubit Hamiltonian with general qubitqubit coupling can be written on the form\n\u0124 = \u2212\n\nX \u01ebi\n\u2206i\n1X\n( \u03c3zi +\n\u03bb\u03bd,ij \u03c3\u03bdi \u03c3\u03bdj\n\u03c3xi ) +\n2\n2\n2 i,j;\u03bd\ni\n\n(10.1)\n\nTo solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u0124|\u03c8i = E|\u03c8i\n\n(10.2)\n\nwe expand the N-qubit state in a complete basis, e.g. the\n2N basis states of the (\u03c3z )N operator,\nX\n|\u03c8i =\naq |qi\n\n= a0 |0..00i + a1 |0..01i + a2 |0..10i + ...a(2N \u22121) |1..11i\n(10.3)\n\nand project onto the basis states\nX\n\u0124\n|pihp|\u03c8i = E|\u03c8i\n\n(10.4)\n\nobtaining the ususal matrix equation\nX\nhq|\u0124|piap = Eaq\n\n(10.5)\n\np\n\np\n\nwhere aq = hq|\u03c8i, with typical matrix elements given by\nHqp = hq|\u0124|pi = h1..01|\u0124|0..11i\nB.\n\n(10.6)\n\nTwo qubits, longitudinal (diagonal) coupling\n\nThe first case is an Ising-type model Hamiltonian, relevant for capacitively or inductively coupled flux qubits,\nH =\u2212\n\nX \u01ebi\n\u2206i\n( \u03c3zi +\n\u03c3xi ) + \u03bb12 \u03c3z1 \u03c3z2\n2\n2\ni=1,2\n\n(10.7)\n\nWe expand a general 2-qubit state in the the \u03c3z basis\nq = {kl},\n|\u03c8i = a1 |00i + a2 |01i + a3 |10i + a4 |11i\n\n(10.8)\n\n\f33\ndealing with pure charge states.

This is the precise analogy\nof the single-qubit dc-pulse scheme discussed in Section\nIV C.\nSince the charge state |00i of the starting point does\nnot have time to evolve during the steep rise of the dcpulse, it remains frozen and forms the initial state |00i\nat time t = 0 at the co-degeneracy point, where it can be\nexpanded in the energy eigenbasis,\n|00i = |\u03c8(0)i = c1 |E1 i + c2 |E2 i + c3 |E3 i + c4 |E4 i\n(10.32)\nTo find the coefficients we project onto the charge basis,\nkl=0,1\nhkl|00i = c1 hkl|E1 i + c2 hkl|E2 i + c3 hkl|E3 i + c4 hkl|E4 i\n(10.33)\nand use the explict results for the energy eigenstates to\ncalculate the matrix elements, obtaining\n(10.34)\n\nFor t > 0 this stationary state then develops in time\ngoverned by the constant Hamiltonian as\n|\u03c8(t)i = a1 e\u2212iE1 t |E1 i + b1 e\u2212iE2 t |E2 i \u2212\n\u2212b2 e+iE2 t |E3 i \u2212 a2 e+iE1 t |E4 i\n\n|\u03c8(t)i =\n\u0002\n\u0003\n|00i a21 e\u2212iE1 t + a22 eiE1 t + b21 e\u2212iE2 t + b22 eiE2 t\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ |01i a1 a2 (e\u2212iE1 t + eiE1 t ) + b1 b2 (e\u2212iE2 t + eiE2 t )\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+ |10i a1 a2 (e\u2212iE1 t + eiE1 t ) \u2212 b1 b2 (e\u2212iE2 t + eiE2 t )\n\u0003\n\u0002\n+ |11i a21 e\u2212iE1 t + a22 eiE1 t \u2212 b21 e\u2212iE2 t \u2212 b22 eiE2 t\n(10.36)\nThis state could be the input state for another gate operation, where some other part of the Hamiltonian is suddenly varied.

The first experiment presents\nRabi oscillations induced and observed in the elementary phase qubit and readout oscillator formed by a\nsingle JJ-junction30,31,32,33,34 . The next example describes a series of recent experiments with a flux qubit24\ncoupled to different kinds of SQUID oscillator readout devices25,26,168 . A further example will discuss the\ncharge-phase qubit coupled to a JJ-junction oscillator21\nand the recent demonstration of extensive NMR-style operation of this qubit23 . The last example will present the\ncase of a charge qubit (single Cooper pair box, SCB)\ncoupled to a microwave stripline oscillator147,148,151,152 ,\nrepresenting a solid-state analogue of \"cavity QED\".\nBefore describing experiments and results, however, we\nwill discuss in some detail the measurement procedures\nthat give information about resonance line profiles, Rabi\noscillations, and relaxation and decohrence times. The\nillustrations will be chosen from Vion et al.21 and related\nwork for the case of the charge-phase qubit, but the examples are relevant for all types of qubits, representing\nfundmental procedures for studying quantum systems.\n\nFIG. 36: Control pulse sequences involved in quantum state\nmanipulations and measurement. Top: microwave voltage\npulses u(t) are applied to the control gate for state manipulation. Middle: a readout dc ac pulse (DCP) or ac pulse (ACP)\nIb (t) is applied to the threshold detector/discriminator a time\ntd after the last microwave pulse. Bottom: output signal V(t)\nfrom the detector. The occurence of a output pulse depends\non the occupation probabilities of the energy eigenstates. A\ndiscriminator with threshold Vth converts V(t) into a boolean\n0/1 output for statistical analysis.\n\nIn Fig. 36 the readout control pulse can be a dc pulse\n(DCP) or ac pulse (ACP). A DCP readout most often\nleads to an output voltage pulse, which may be quite\ndestructive for the quantum system. An ACP readout\npresents a much weaker perturbation by probing the\nac-response of an oscillator coupled to the qubit, creating\nmuch less back action, at best representing QND readout.\n\n1.\n\nIn the simplest use of the classical oscillator, it does\nnot discriminate between the two different qubit states,\nbut only between energies of radiation emitted by a lossy\nresonator coupled to the qubit. In this way it is possible\nto detect the \"low-frequency\" Rabi oscillation of a qubit\ndriven by continuous (i.e. not pulsed) high-frequency\nradiation tuned in the vicinity of the qubit transition energy. If the oscillator is tunable, the resonance window\ncan be swept past the Rabi line. Alternatively, the Rabi\nfrequency can be tuned and swept past the oscillator window by changing the qubit pumping power27 .\n\n2.\nA.\n\nSpectroscopic detection of Rabi oscillation\n\nCharge qubit energy level occupation from counting\nelectrons: rf-SET\n\nReadout detectors\n\nBefore discussing some of the actual experiments, it\nis convenient to describe some of basic readout-detector\nprinciples which more or less the same for the SET, rfSET, JJ and SQUID devices. A typical pulse scheme for\nexciting a qubit and reading out the response is shown\nin Fig. 36:\n\nIn this case, the charge qubit is interacting with a beam\nof electrons passing through a single-electron transistor\n(SET) coupled to a charge qubit (e.g. the rf-SET,69 ), as\ndiscussed in Section VIII and illustrated in Fig. 22. In\nthese cases the transmissivity of the electrons will show\ntwo distinct values correlated with the two states of the\nqubit.\n\n\f36\n\nI\n\nIc\n\n2\u2206\n\neV\n\nFIG. 37: Current-voltage characteristic of tunnel junction\n(solid line) consists of the Josephson branch - vertical line at\nV = 0, and the dissipative branch - curve at eV \u2265 2\u2206. When\nthe current is ramped, the junction stays at the Josephson\nbranch and when the current approaches the critical value Ic ,\nthe junction switches to the dissipative branch (dashed line).\n\n3.\n\nCoupled qubit-classical-oscillator system: switching\ndetectors with dc-pulse (DCP) output\n\nIn Section VIII we analyzed the case of an SCT qubit\ncurrent-coupled to a JJ-oscillator (Fig. 25) and discussed\nthe Hamiltonian of the coupled qubit-JJ-oscillator system. The effect of the qubit was to deform the oscillator\npotential in different ways depending on the state of the\nqubit. The effect can then be probed in a number of\nways, by input and output dc and ac voltage and current\npulses, to determine the occupation of the qubit energy\nlevels.\nUsing non-linear oscillators like single JJs or SQUIDS\none can achieve threshold and switching behaviour where\nthe JJ/SQUID switches out of the zero-voltage state, resulting in an output dc-voltage pulse.\nSwitching JJ: The method is based on the dependence\nof the critical current of the JJ on the state of the qubit,\nand consists of applying a short current DCP to the JJ\nat a value Ib during a time \u2206t, so that the JJ will switch\nout of its zero-voltage state with a probability Psw (Ib ).\nFor well-chosen parameters, the detection efficiency can\napproach unity. The switching probability then directly\nmeasures the qubit's energy level population.\nSwitching SQUID: In the experiments on flux qubits\nby the Delft group, two kinds of physical coupling of\nthe SQUID to the qubit have been implemented, namely\ninductive coupling (Fig. 38 (left))7,168 and direct coupling (Fig. 38 (right)):24,25,26 The critical current of\nthe SQUID depends on the flux threading the loop, and\ntherefore is different for different qubit states. The problem is to detect a two percent variation in the SQUID\ncritical current associated with a transition between the\nqubit states in a time shorter than the qubit energy relaxation time T1 . The SQUID behaves as an oscillator with a\ncharacteristic plasma frequency \u03c9p = [(L + LJ )Csh ]\u22121/2 .\nThis frequency depends on the bias current Ib and on\nthe critical current\nIC via the Josephson inductance\np\nLJ = \u03a60 /2\u03c0IC 1 \u2212 Ib2 /Ic2 (the shunt capacitor with ca-\n\nFIG. 38: Schematics of readout dc SQUID coupled to flux\nqubit; left - inductive coupling, right - direct phase coupling\n\npacitance Csh and lead inductance L is used to \"tune\"\n\u03c9p ). Thus, the plasma frequency takes different values\n(1)\n(0)\n\u03c9p or \u03c9p depending on the state of qubit, representing\ntwo different shapes of the SQUID oscillator potential.\nIn the dc-pulse-triggered switching SQUID7,24,25 , a\ndc-current readout-pulse is applied after the operation\npulse(s) (Fig. 36), setting a switching threshold for the\ncritical current. The circulating qubit current for one\nqubit state will then add to the critical current and make\nthe SQUID switch to the voltage state, while the other\nqubit state will reduce the current and leave the SQUID\nin the zero-voltage state.\nIn an application of ac-pulse-triggered switching\nSQUID26 , readout relies on resonant activation by a microwave pulse at a frequency close to \u03c9p , adjusting the\npower so that the SQUID switches to the finite voltage\nstate by resonant activation if the qubit is in state |0i,\nwhereas it stays in the zero-voltage state if it is in state\n|1i. The resonant activation scheme is similar to the readout scheme used by Martinis et al.30,31,32,33 . (see Section\nXI C).\n\n4.\n\nCoupled qubit-classical-oscillator system: ac-pulse\n(ACP) non-switching detectors\n\nThis implementation of ACP readout uses the qubitSQUID combination7 shown in Fig. 38 (left), but with\nACP instead of DCP readout, implementing a nondestructive dispersive method for the readout of the flux\nqubit168 . The detection is based on the measurement\nof the Josephson inductance of a dc-SQUID inductively\ncoupled to the qubit. Using this method, Lupascu et\nal.168 measured the spectrum of the qubit resonance line\nand obtained relaxation times around 80 \u03bcs, much longer\nthan observed with DCP.\nA related readout scheme was recently implemented by\nSiddiqi et al.169 using two different oscillation states of\nthe non-linear JJ in the zero-voltage state.\n\n\f37\n\nFIG. 39: Left: qubit energy level scheme.

Courtesy of D.\nEsteve, CEA-Saclay.\n\nOperation and measurement procedures\n\nA number of operation and readout pulses can be applied to a qubit circuit in order to measure various properties. The number of applied microwave pulses can vary\ndepending on what quantities are to be measured: resonance line profile, relaxation time, Rabi oscillation, Ramsey interference or Spin Echo, as discussed below.\n\n1.\n\nResonance line profiles and T2 decoherence times\n\nTo study the resonance line profile, one applies a single long weak microwave pulse with given frequency, followed by a readout pulse. The procedure is then repeated\nfor a spectrum of frequencies. The Rabi oscillation amplitude, the upper state population, and the detector\nswitching probability p(t) will depend on the detuning\nand will grow towards resonance. The linewidth gives\ndirectly the total inverse decoherence lifetime 1/T2 =\n1/2T1 + 1/T\u03c6 . The decoherence-time contributions from\nrelaxation (1/T1 ) and dephasing (1/T\u03c6 ) can be (approximately) separately measured, as discussed below.\n\n2.\n\nT1 relaxation times\n\nTo determine the T1 relaxation time one measures the\ndecacy of the population of the upper |1i state after a\nlong microwave pulse saturating the transition, varying\nthe delay time td of the detector readout pulse. The\nmeasured T1 =1.8 microseconds is so far the best value\nfor the Quantronium charge-phase qubit.\n\nFIG. 41: Left: Rabi oscillations of the switching probability\nmeasured just after a resonant microwave pulse of duration.\nRight: Measured Rabi frequency (dots) varies linearly with\nmicrowave amplitude (voltage) as expected. Courtesy of D.\nEsteve, CEA-Saclay.\n\n3.\n\nRabi oscillations and T2,Rabi decoherence time\n\nTo study Rabi oscillations (frequency \u03a9 \u223c u, the amplitude of driving field) one turns on a resonant microwave pulse for a given time t\u03bcw and measures the upper |1i state population (probability) p1 (t) after a given\n(short) delay time td . If the systems is perfectly coherent, the state vector will develop as cos \u03a9t |0i+sin \u03a9t |1i,\nand the population of the upper state will then oscillate as sin2 \u03a9t between 0 and 1. In the presence of decoherence, the amplitude of the oscillation of p1 (t) will\ndecay on a time scale TRabi towards the average value\np1 (t = \u221e) = 0.5. This corresponds to incoherent saturation of the 0 to 1 transition.\n\n\f38\n\nFIG. 42: Ramsey fringes of the switching probability after two phase-coherent microwave \u03c0/2 pulses separated by\nthe time delay t. The continuous line represents a fit by\nexponentially damped cosine function with time constant\nT2\u2217 = T\u03c6 = 0.5\u03bcs. The oscillation period coincides with the\ninverse of the detuning frequency \u03b4 (here \u03b4 = \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd01 = 20.6\nMHz). Courtesy of D. Esteve, CEA-Saclay.\n\nFIG. 43: Spin-echo experiment. The left part shows the\nbasic Ramsey oscillation. The right part shows the echo signal\nappearing in the time window around twice the time delay\nbetween the first \u03c0/2-pulse and the \u03c0-pulse. Courtesy of D.\nEsteve, CEA-Saclay.\n\n5.\n4.\n\nRamsey interference, dephasing and T2,Ramsey\ndecoherence time\n\nThe Ramsey interference experiment measures the decoherence time of the non-driven, freely precessing, qubit.\nIn this experiment a \u03c0/2 microwave pulse around the xaxis induces Rabi oscillation that tips the spin from the\nnorth pole down to the equator. The spin vector rotates\nin the x-y plane, and after a given time \u2206t, another \u03c0/2\nmicrowave pulse is applied, immediately followed by a\nreadout pulse.\nSince the \u03c0/2 pulses are detuned by \u03b4 from the qubit\n|0i \u2192 |1i transition frequency, the qubit will precess\nwith frequency \u03b4 relative to the rotating frame of the\ndriving field. Since the second microwave pulse will be\napplied in the plane of the rotating frame, it will have\na projection cos \u03b4t on the qubit vector and will drive\nthe qubit towards the north or south poles, resulting\nin a specific time-independent final superposition state\ncos \u03b4t |0i + sin \u03b4t |1i of the qubit at the end of the last\n\u03c0/2 pulse. The readout pulse then catches the qubit\nin this superposition state and forces it to decay if the\nqubit is in the upper |1i state. The probability will\noscillate with the detuning frequency, and a single-shot\nexperiment will then detect the upper state with this\nprobability. Repeating the experiment many times for\ndifferent pi/2 pulse separation \u2206t will then give |0i or\n|1i with probabilities cos2 \u03b4t and sin2 \u03b4t. Taking the\naverage, and then varying the pulse separation, will\ntrace out the Ramsey interference oscillatory signal.\nDephasing will make the signa decay on the timescale T\u03c6 .\n\nSpin-echo\n\nThe spin-echo and Ramsey pulse sequences differ in\nthat a \u03c0-pulse around the x-axis is added in between the\ntwo \u03c0/2-pulses in the spin-echo experiment, as shown in\nFig.43. As in the Ramsey experiment, the first \u03c0/2-pulse\nmakes the Bloch vector start rotating in the equatorial\nx-y plane with frequency E/h\u0304 = \u03bd01 . The effect of the\n\u03c0-pulse is now to flip the entire x-y plane with the rotating Bloch vector around the x-axis, reflecting the Bloch\nvector in the x-z plane. The Bloch vector then continues\nto rotate in the x-y plane in the same direction. Finally\na second \u03c0/2-pulse is applied to project the state on the\nz-axis.\nIf two Bloch vectors with slightly different frequency\nstart rotating at the same time in the x-y plane, they will\nmove with different angular speeds. The effect of the \u03c0pulse at time \u2206t will be to permute the Bloch vectors,\nand then let the motion continue in the same direction.\nThis is similar to reversing the motion and letting the\nBloch vectors back-trace. The net result is that the two\nBloch vectors re-align after time 2\u2206t.\nIn NMR experiments, the different Bloch vectors correspond to different spins in the ensemble. In the case\nof a single qubit, the implication is that in a series of repeated experiments, the result will be insensitive to small\nvariations \u03b4E of the qubit energy between measurements,\nas long as the energy (rotation frequency) is constant\nduring one and the same measurement. If fluctuations\noccur during one measurement, then this cannot be corrected for. The spin-echo procedure can therefore remove\nthe measurement-related line-broadening associated with\nslow fluctuations of the qubit precession, and allow observation of the intrinsic coherence time of the qubit.\n\n\f39\nC.\n\nNIST Current-biased Josephson Junction Qubit\n\nSeveral experimental groups have realized the Josephson Junction (JJ) qubit29,30,31,32,33,34 .

In this experiment the junction parameters and bias current were chosen such that a small number of well defined levels were\nformed in the potential well (Fig. 21), with the interlevel frequencies, \u03c901 /2\u03c0 = 6.9GHz and \u03c912 /2\u03c06.28GHz,\nthe quality factor was Q=380. The experiment was performed at very low temperature, T= 25 mK.\n\nThe qubit was driven from the ground state, |0i, to\nthe upper state, |1i, by the resonance rf pulse with frequency \u03c901 , and then the occupation of the upper qubit\nlevel was measured. The measurement was performed by\nexciting qubit further from the upper level to the auxiliary level with higher escape rate by applying the second\nresonance pulse with frequency \u03c912 . During the whole\noperation, across the junction only oscillating voltage develops with zero average value over the period. When the\ntunneling event occurred, the junction switched to the\ndissipative regime, and finite dc voltage appeared across\nthe junction, which was detected. Alternatively, postmeasurement classical states \"0\" and \"1\" differ in flux\nby \u03a60 , which is readily measured by a readout SQUID.\nThe relaxation rate was measured in the standard way\nby applying a Rabi pumping pulse followed by a measuring pulse with a certain delay. Non-exponential relaxation was observed, first rapid, \u223c 20 nsec, and then more\nslow, \u223c 300 nsec. By reducing the length of the pumping\npulse down to 25 nsec, i.e. below the relaxation time,\nRabi oscillations were observed. In this experiment the\namplitude of the pumping pulse rather than duration was\nvaried, which affected the Rabi frequency and allowed the\nobservation of oscillation of the level population for fixed\nduration of the pumping pulse.\nThe Grenoble group34 has observed coherent oscillations in a multi-level quantum system, formed by a\ncurrent-biased dc SQUID. These oscillations have been\ninduced by applying resonant microwave pulses of flux.\nQuantum measurement is performed by a nanosecond\nflux pulse that projects the final state onto one of two\ndifferent voltage states of the dc SQUID, which can be\nread out. The number of quantum states involved in the\ncoherent oscillations increases with increasing microwave\npower. The dependence of the oscillation frequency on\nmicrowave power deviates strongly from the linear regime\nexpected for a two-level system and can be very well explained by a theoretical model taking into account the\nanharmonicity of the multi-level system.\n\nFIG. 44: Upper panel: Scanning electron micrograph of a\nsmall-loop flux-qubit with three Josephson junctions of critical current \u223c 0.5 mA, and an attached large-loop SQUID\nwith two big Josephson junctions of critical current \u223c 2.2 mA.\nArrows indicate the two directions of the persistent current\nin the qubit. Lower panels: Schematic of the on-chip circuit; crosses represent the Josephson junctions. The SQUID\nis shunted by two capacitors to reduce the SQUID plasma frequency and biased through a small resistor to avoid parasitic\nresonances in the leads. Symmetry of the circuit is introduced\nto suppress excitation of the SQUID from the qubit-control\npulses.

The current line provides the measuring pulse Ib and the voltage line\nallows the readout of the switching pulse V out.

Recently the Delft group has also\ninvestigated designs where the 3-junction qubit is sharing a loop with the measurement SQUID to increase the\ncoupling strength24 , as shown in Fig. 44.\nTo observe and study Rabi oscillations, the qubit was\nbiased at the degeneracy point and the qubit |0i \u2192 |1i\ntransition excited by a pulse of 5.71 GHz microwave radiation of variable length, followed by a bias-current (Ib )\nreadout pulse applied to the SQUID (Fig. 44, lower left\npanel). The first (high) part of the readout pulse (about\n10 ns) has two functions: It displaces the qubit away from\nthe degeneracy point so that the qubit eigenstates carry\nfinite current, and it tilts the SQUID potential so that\nthe SQUID can escape to the voltage state if the qubit is\nin its upper state. The purpose of the long lower plateau\nof the the readout pulse is to prevent the SQUID from\n\n\f40\n\nFIG. 45: AFM picture of the charge-phase qubit (\"quantronium\") corresponding to the circuit scheme in Fig. 25.

The level splitting at\nthis point is determined by the Josephson tunneling interaction EJ , and is a function of the external bias \u03c6e )\n\u2206(\u03c6e ) = 2EJ cos(\u03c6e /2).\nFigure 47 shows the frequency surface \u03bd01 = \u2206E/h,\n\u2206E = E2 \u2212 E1 . During operation, the qubit is preferably\nparked at the degeneracy point (ng , \u03c6e ) = (0.5, 0) where\nQ = I = 0, in order to minimize the decohering influence\nof noise. In order to induce a qubit response, for gate\noperation or readout, one must therefore either (i) move\nthe bias point away from point (0.5, 0) to have finite firstorder response with Q 6= 0 or I 6= 0, or (ii) stay at (0.5, 0)\nand apply a perturbing ac-field that makes the secondorder response significant.\n\n2.\n\nThe CEA-Saclay \"quantronium\" charge-phase qubit\n\nThe \"quantronium\" charge-phase circuit is given by\nFig. 45 adding a large readout Josephson junction in\nthe loop (cf. Fig. 25). The minimum linewidth (Fig. 39)\ncorresponds to a Q-value of 20000 and a decoherence time\nT2 = 0.5 \u03bcs. With the measured relaxation time T1 =1.8\n\u03bcs (Fig. 40), the dephasing time can be estimated to\nT\u03c6 =0.8 \u03bcs.\nA set of results for Rabi oscillations of the Saclay\nquantronium qubit is shown in Fig. 41. The decoherence time represents decoherence under driving conditions. Another, more fundamental, measure of decoherence is the free precession dephasing time T2 when the\nqubit is left to itself. This is measured in in the Ramsey\ntwo-pulse experiment, as already described above in Fig.\n42 showing the CEA-Saclay data21,22 , giving T2 = 0.5 \u03bcs.\n\nFIG. 48: Free-evolution decoherence times for the quantronium charge-phase SCT qubit.170 (Ng = ng ; \u03b4/2\u03c0 = \u03c6e .) Full\nand dashed curves represent results of theoretical modeling.\nCourtesy of D. Esteve, CEA-Saclay.\n\nThe spin-echo results in Ref.22 gave a lifetime as long as\nT2 = 1\u03bcs.\nIn a recent systematic experimental and theoretical investigation of a specific charge-phase device, investigating the effects of relaxation and dephasing on Rabi oscillation, Ramsey fringes and spin-echos170 , one obtains\nthe following picture of different coherence times for the\nquantronium charge-phase qubit:\nFluctuations of charge \u03b4ng and flux \u03b4\u03c6e will shift\nenergy\nlevels and make the qubit transition energy\np\n\u01eb(ng + \u03b4ng )2 + \u2206(\u03c6e + \u03b4\u03c6e )2 fluctuate. However, the\ncharge degeneracy point is a saddle point, which means\nthat at that working point the qubit transition frequency\nis insensitive to low-frequency noise to first order, allowing long coherence times. As can be seen in Fig. 48,\nthe coherence is sharply peaked ound the \"magic\" degeneracy point. The spin-echo experiment indicates the\npresence of slow charge fluctuations from perturbing impurity two-level systems (TLS) (1/f noise) and that long\ncoherence time can be recovered by spin-echo techniques\nuntil the decoherence becomes too rapid at significant\ndistances from the magic point along the charge axis. In\ncontrast, in the experiments with this device the decoherence due to phase fluctuations could not be significantly\ncompensated for by spin-echo techniques, indicating that\nthe phase noise (current and flux noise) in this device is\nhigh-frequency noise.\n\n\f42\nXII.\n\nEXPERIMENTS WITH QUBITS COUPLED\nTO QUANTUM OSCILLATORS\nA.\n\nGeneral discussion\n\nThe present development of quantum information processing with Josephson Junctions (JJ-QIP) goes in the\ndirection of coupling qubits with quantum oscillators, for\noperation, readout and memory. In Section VIII we discussed the SCT, i.e. a single Cooper-pair transistor in\na superconducting loop71 , providing one typical form of\nthe Hamiltonian for a qubit-oscillator coupled system.\nWe also showed with perturbation theory how the Hamiltonian gave rise to qubit-dependent deformed oscillator\npotential and shifted oscillator frequency. In VIII, in\naddition we discussed the SCT charge-coupled to an LCoscillator, which is also representative for a flux qubit\ncoupled to a SQUID oscillator, and which describes a\ncharge qubit in a microwave cavity.\nTo connect to the language of quantum optics and cavity QED and the current work on solid-state applications,\nwe now explicitly introduce quantization of the oscillator.\nQuantizing the oscillator, \u03c6\u0303 \u223c (a+ + a), a representative\nform of the qubit-oscillator Hamiltonian reads:\n\u0124 = \u0124q + \u0124int + \u0124osc\n1\n\u0124q = \u2212 E \u03c3z\n2\n\u0124int = g \u03c3x (a+ + a)\n1\n\u0124osc = h\u0304\u03c9 (a+ a + )\n2\n\n(12.1)\n(12.2)\n(12.3)\n(12.4)\n\nIntroducing the step operators \u03c3\u00b1 = \u03c3x \u00b1 i \u03c3y , the interaction term can be written as\n\u0124int = g (\u03c3+ a + \u03c3\u2212 a+ ) + g (\u03c3+ a+ + \u03c3\u2212 a)\n\n(12.5)\n\nThe first term\n\u0124int = g (\u03c3+ a + \u03c3\u2212 a+ )\n\n(12.6)\n\nrepresents the resonant (co-rotating) part of the interaction, while the second term represents the non-resonant\ncounter-rotating part. In the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) one only keeps the first term, which gives the\nJaynes-Cummings model171,172,173,174 . Diagonalizing the\nJaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian to second order by a unitary transformation gives\n1\ng2\ng2\nH = \u2212 (E + ) \u03c3z + (h\u0304\u03c9 +\n\u03c3z ) a+ a\n2\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\n(12.7)\n\nwhere \u03b4 = E \u2212 h\u0304\u03c9 is the so called detuning. The result illustrates what we have already discussed in detail,\nnamely that (i) the qubit transition energy E is shifted\n(renormalized) by the coupling to the oscillator, and (ii)\nthe oscillator energy h\u0304\u03c9 is shifted by the qubit in different directions depending on the state of the qubit, which\nallows discriminating the two qubit states.\n\nFIG. 49: Qubit-oscillator level structure. The notation for\nthe states is: |qubit; oscillatori = |0/1; n = 0, 1, ..i; (a) E \u2248\n2h\u0304\u03c9: very large \"detuning\", weak coupling. (b) E \u2248 h\u0304\u03c9:\nresonance, strong coupling and hybridization, level (\"vacuum\nRabi\") splitting.\n\nFigure 49 shows the basic level structure of the qubitoscillator system in the cases of (a) weak and (b) strong\ncoupling.\nWhat is weak or strong coupling is determined by the\nstrength of the level hybridization, which in the end depends on qubit-oscillator detuning and level degeneracies.\nThe perturbative Hamiltonian in Eq. (12.7) is valid for\nlarge detuning (g \u226a \u03b4qr ) and allows us to approach the\ncase of strong coupling between the qubit and the oscillator. Close to resonance the degenerate states have to\nbe treated non-perturbatively.\nFigure 49(a) corresponds to the weak-coupling (nonresonant) case where the levels of the two subsystems are\nonly weakly perturbed by the coupling, adding red and\nblue sideband transitions |01i \u2192 |10i and |00i \u2192 |11i to\nthe main zero-photon transition |00i \u2192 |10i.\nFigure 49(b) corresponds to the resonant strongcoupling case when the |01 > and |10 > states are degenerate, in which case the qubit-oscillator coupling produces two \"bonding-antibonding\" states in the usual way,\nand the main line becomes split into two lines (\"vacuum\nRabi splitting\". Of major importance are the linewidths\nof the qubit and the oscillator relative to the splittings\ncaused by the interaction. To discriminate between the\ntwo qubit states, the oscillator shift must be larger than\nthe average level width.\nSince the qubit and the oscillator form a coherent\nmulti-level system, as described before (Section X B 3),\nthe time evolution can be written as c1 (t)|00i+c2 (t)|01i+\nc3 (t)|10i+c4 (t)|11i, which in general does not reduce to a\nproduct of qubit and oscillator states, and therefore represents (time-dependent) entanglement. This provides\nopportunities for implementing quantum gate operation\ninvolving qubits and oscillators.\nGeneration and control of entangled states can be\nachieved by using microwave pulses to induce Rabi oscillation between specific transitions of the coupled qubitoscillator system, and the result can be studied by spectroscopy on suitable transitions or by time-resolved detection of suitable Rabi oscillations.\n\n\f43\n\nFIG. 50: Resonant frequencies indicated by peaks in the\nSQUID switching probability when a long (300 ns) microwave\npulse excites (saturates) the system before the readout pulse.\nData are represented as a function of the external flux \u03a6ext\nthrough the qubit area away from the qubit symmetry point.\nThe blue |00i \u2192 |11i and red |01i \u2192 |10i sidebands are shown\nby down- and up-triangles, respectively; continuous lines are\nobtained by adding 2.96 GHz and -2.90 GHz, respectively,\nto the central continuous line (numerical fit).

The SQUID provides the measurement system for detecting the quantum states (threshold\nswitching detector, Fig. 44). It is also presents an effective inductance that, in parallel with an external shunt\ncapacitance, acts as a low-frequency harmonic oscillator;\nthe qubit and oscillator frequencies are approximately\nh\u03bdq = h\u03bd01 \u2248 6 GHz and h\u03bdr \u2248 3 GHz, corresponding\nto Fig. 49(a).\nIn the Delft experiment25 , performing spectroscopy on\nthe coupled qubit-oscillator multi-level system reveals the\nvariation of the main and sideband transitions with flux\nbias \u03a6ext , as shown in Fig. 50. The presence of visible\nsideband transitions demonstrates the qubit-oscillator interaction and (weak) level hybridization).\nShort microwave pulses can now be used to induce Rabi\noscillations between the various qubit-oscillator transitions. In the Delft experiment25 , microwave pulses with\nfrequency \u03bdq = \u03bd01 \u2248 \u2206/h \u2248 5.9 GHz (qubit symmetry point) were first used to induce Rabi oscillations\nwith \u223c 25 ns decay time at the main qubit transition\n|00i \u2192 |10i (and |01i \u2192 |11i) for different values of\nthe microwave power.

Alternatively, such Rabi oscillations can instead be blocked\nby the first excitation.\nThis is shown experimentally in Fig. ??: by preparing\nthe initial state with initial \u03c0 and 2\u03c0 pulses, the sideband Rabi oscillations could be turned off and on again.\nThe corresponding Rabi oscillations are shown in the left\npart of Fig. ??(b), demonstrating rapid decay due to the\nstrong damping of the SQUID oscillator (lifetime \u223c 3 ns;\nQ=100-150).\nIn the previous example, the control pulse (first pulse)\nwas applied to the main |00i \u2192 |10i transition, controlling the populations of the \"0\" and \"1\" levels. In the\nnext example, microwave control pulse is applied to the\n|00i \u2192 |01i transition, inducing Rabi oscillations which\npopulate the first excited state of oscillator. A second\nmicrowave pulse (in principle, with different frequency)\ncan then induce Rabi oscillations on the |01i \u2192 |10i\ntransition (red-sideband).

The stripline resonator, a\nfinite length (24 mm) of planar wave guide, is a solid-state\nanalogue of the cavity electromagnetic resonator used in\nquantum optics to study strong atom-photon interaction\nand entanglement. In the Yale experiments, the qubit is\nplaced in the transverse field in the gap between the resonator strip lines, i.e. inside the microwave cavity. The\nEC and EJ parameters are such that the SCT is effectively in the charge-phase region, and it is operated by\ncontrolling both the charge and phase (flux) ports.\nThe large effective electric dipole moment d of Cooper\npair box and the large vacuum electric field E0 in the\ntransmission line cavity lead to a large vacuum Rabi frequency \u03bdRabi = 2dE0 /h, which allows reaching the strong\ncoupling limit of cavity QED in the circuit.\nIn the Yale experiment, spectroscopic measurements\nare performed by driving the qubit with resonant microwave pulses and simultaneously detecting the frequency and intensity-dependent amplitude and phase of\nprobe pulses of microwave radiation sent through a transmission line coupled to the stripline resonator via input/out capacitors (Fig. 54). The oscillator frequency\nis fixed at h\u03bdr \u2248 6 GHz. The qubit level separation, on\nthe other hand, is tunable over a wide frequency range\naround 6 GHz in two independent ways: (i) by varying the magnetic flux \u03c6e through the loop, forming the\nphase (flux) gate V D, or (ii) by varying the charge ng via\nthe voltage gate, primarily around the charge degeneracy\npoint, ng =1/2, to minimize the effect of charge fluctuations.\nThe flux bias is used to tune the qubit transition frequency at ng =1/2 to values larger or smaller than the resonator frequency. The tuning the qubit frequency with\nthe charge gate will provide two distinct cases: the qubit\nalways detuned from the oscillator, and the qubit being\ndegenerate with the resonator at certain values of ng .\n\n\f45\nA central result151 is the evidence for the qubitoscillator hybridization and splitting of the degenerate\n|01i and |10i states, \u03bd01 \u2192 \u03bd\u00b1 , as illustrated in Fig.\n49 (right). This splitting is often called \"vacuum Rabi\"\nsplitting because the ocillator is in its ground (vacuum)\nstate.\nThe |01i, |10i level splitting is observed through microwave excitation of the 0 \u2192 1 resonance transition\nand observing the splitting of the resonance line as the\nqubit and the oscillator are tuned into resonance (by tuning the qubit frequency to zero qubit-oscillator detuning,\n\u03b4 = \u03bdq \u2212 \u03bdr = 0).\n\nAnother central result152 is the evidence for a long\nqubit dephasing time of T2 > 200 ns under optimal conditions: qubit parked at the charge degeneracy point,\nand weak driving field (low photon occupation number\nin the resonator cavity). In the experiment151 the qubitoscillator detuning is large, the qubit resonance transition \u03bdq = \u03bd01 is scanned by microwave radiation, and the\ndispersive shift of the resonator frequency \u03bdr seen by a\nmicrowave probe beam is used to determine the occupation of the qubit levels. Scanning the qubit |00i \u2192 |10i\nresonance line profile allowed to determine the lineshape\nand linewith as a function of microwave power, giving the\nbest value of T2 > 200 ns. Moreover, observation of the\npostion of the resonance as a function of microwave power\nallowed the determination of the ac-Stark shift, i.e. the\nRabi frequency as a function of the photon occupation\n(electric field) of the cavity. The measurement induces\nan ac-Stark shift of 0.6 MHz per photon in the qubit level\nseparation. Fluctuations in the photon number (shot\nnoise) induce level fluctuations in the qubit leading to\ndephasing which is the characteristic back-action of the\nmeasurement. A cross-over from Lorentzian to Gaussian resonance line shape with increasing measurement\npower is observed and explained by dependence of the\nresonance linewidth on the cavity occupation number,\nexceeding the linewidth due to intrinsic decoherence at\nhigh rf-power.\n\nD.\n\nComparison of the Delft and Yale approaches\n\nIn comparison, the Delft experiment25 corresponds to\nthe case of very large detuning (\u03bdq = 6 GHz, \u03bdr = 3 GHz;\n\u03b4 = \u03bdq \u2212 \u03bdr \u223c \u03bdr ; Fig. 49 (left)), so that one will observe\na main resonance line |00i \u2192 |10i and two sidebands,\n|00i \u2192 |11i (blue) and |01i \u2192 |10i (red). Decreasing the\ndetuning \u03b4, the blue and red sidebands will move away\nto higher resp. lower frequencies, and one will arrive at\nthe case of zero detuning and qubit-oscillator degeneracy.\nIf the qubit-oscillator coupling is larger than the average\nlinewidth, one will then observe a splitting of the main\nline (Fig. 49 (right)).\n\nFIG. 55: The NEC 2-qubit system: two capacitively coupled charge qubits.

The\nHamiltonian for the NEC system of two capacitively coupled charge qubits (SCBs) was analyzed in the Appendix.\nThe four energy eigenvalues E1,2,3,4 (ng1 , ng2 ) are plotted in Fig. 56 as a functions of the gate charges. At\neach point in the parameter space, an arbitrary two-qubit\nstate can be written as a superposition of the four twoqubit energy eigenstates.\nAs described in Sections IV and X, the general procedure for operating with dc-pulses is to initialize the system to its ground state |00i at the chosen starting point\n(ng10 , ng20 ) and then suddenly change the Hamiltonian\nat time t = 0 to the gate bias (ng1 , ng2 ). If the change is\nstrictly sudden, then the state at (ng1 , ng2 ) at time t = 0\nis |\u03c8(t = 0)i = |00i, which can be expanded in the energy\nbasis of the Hamiltonian,\n|\u03c8(0)i = |00i = c1 |E1 i + c2 |E2 i + c3 |E3 i + c4 |E4 i (13.1)\nThis stationary state then develops in time governed by\nthe constant Hamiltonian as\n|\u03c8(t)i = c1 e\u2212iE1 t |E1 i + c2 e\u2212iE2 t |E2 i +\n\n\f46\n\nFIG. 57: The NEC 2-qubit system: pulse sequences for a\nCNOT gate (actually, the gate is a N OT \u2212 CN OT gate).\nCourtesy of J.S.

Specifically, the NEC scheme is to\napply sequential dc-pulses to the charge pulse gates of\neach of the two qubits in Fig. 55. Two cases have been\nstudied so far:\n(1) Vg1 (t) = Vg2 (t): This is the case with common\ncontrol dc-pulses for studied by Pashkin et al.35 . Since\n\u01eb1 (t) = \u01eb2 (t), the plane of operation is at 45 degrees to\nthe axes in Fig. 56. As a result, Pashkin et al.35 observed\ninterference effects and beating oscillations between the\ntwo qubits, as described by Eq. (10.43).\n(2) Vg1 (t) = 0; Vg2 (t), Vg1 (t); Vg2 (t) = 0: This is the\ncase with separate sequential dc pulses on separate gates\nrecently studied by Yamamoto et al.36 . The scheme is\nillustrated in Fig. 56: Starting at point A, first the system is pulsed in the ng1 direction, putting the system\nin a superposition of the states at points A and B; then\nthe system is pulsed in the ng2 direction, allowing condi-\n\ntional gate operation due to the different time evolution\nof the states departing from A or B.\nSpecifically, an entangling gate of controlled-NOT\n(CNOT) type was demonstrated by Yamamoto et al.36\nusing the pulse sequences shown in Fig. 57: First one\napplies a dc-pulse to gate 1 of the control qubit, moving out (down left) left from |00i (point A in Fig. 56)\nin the ng1 direction to the single-qubit degeneracy point\n(point E), staying for a certain time, and then moving\nback (turning off the pulse), putting the system in a superposition \u03b1|00i + \u03b2|10i (points A and B). Next one\napplies a dc-pulse to gate 2 of the target qubit, moving\nout (right) in the ng2 direction and back. The pulse is\ndesigned to reach the first degeneracy point (point G),\nallowing the state to develop into a superposition of 00\n(point A) and 01 (point C) if the control state was 00. If\ninstead the control state was 10 (point B), the dc-pulse\non gate 2 will not reach the two-qubit degeneracy point\n(point H) and the development will be roughly adiabatic,\ntaking the state back to 10 (point B), never reaching 11\n(point D).\nWith timing such (\u03c0/2-pulse) that 00 \u2192 01 (A \u2192 G \u2192\nC), the control gate leads to 00+10, and the target gate\nonly modifies the first component (00 \u2192 01), resulting in\n01+10, i.e. one of the Bell states. This is shown in the\ntop panel of Fig. 57.\nIf instead one first applies a \u03c0/2-pulse in the ng2 direction to the target qubit, inducing 00 \u2192 01 (C), and\nthen applies a \u03c0/2-pulse in the ng1 direction to this state,\nreaching 01+11, and then again applies a \u03c0/2-pulse to the\ntarget qubit 2, resulting 00+11, one obtains the other\nBell state. This is shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 57.\n\n\f47\n\nFIG. 58: Scanning microscope image of two inductively coupled qubits surrounded by a DC-SQUID. Courtesy of J.

Presently, ter Haar et al.175 are investigating a more\nstrongly coupled system with a JJ in the common leg (cf.\nFig. 32), inducing Rabi oscillations and performing conditional spectroscopy along the lines described in Section\nXII in connection with the coupled qubit-oscillator system.\nA similar device with two flux qubits inside a coupling/measurement SQUID has recently been investigated by et al.176,177 , so far demonstrating Rabi oscillation of individual qubits. Finally, Izmalkov et al.39 have\nspectroscopically demonstrated effects of qubit-qubit interaction and hybridization for two inductively coupled\nflux qubits inside a low-frequency tank circuit.\n\nC.\n\nFIG. 59: Circuit scheme for two capacitively coupled current\n(flux) biased JJ qubits with rf and dc control/readout lines.\nAdapted from McDermott et al.178\n\nTwo capacitively coupled JJ qubits\n\nCapacitive coupling of two JJ qubits (Section IX\nE, Fig. 30) has recently been investigated by several\ngroups40,178 , showing indirect40 and direct178 evidence\nfor qubit entanglement.

A microwave \u03c0-pulse tuned to the |0i \u2192 |1i transition of one of\nthe isolated qubits will \"suddenly\" induce a |00i \u2192 |10i\ntransition, populating the |E+ i = |10i + |01i and |E\u2212 i =\n|10i \u2212 |01i states with equal weights.

With one ideal detector for each qubit we can measure the state of each\nqubit with any prescribed time delay between measurements. With simultaneous measurements we can determine all the probabilities pij = |hij|\u03c8(t)i|2 , ideally giving p10 = 21 (1 + cos(\u03b4Et)), p01 = 12 (1 \u2212 cos(\u03b4Et)), and\np00 = p11 = 0 in the absence of relaxation, decoherence\nand perturbations caused by the detectors.\nFigure 61 shows the actual experimental results of\nRef.178 for the probabilities pij (t): The p10 and p01 probabilities oscillate out-of-phase, as expected. In addition,\nthe average probabilities and oscillation amplitudes all\ndecay with time. The results are compatible178 with the\nthe finite rise time of the initial \u03c0-pulse (5 ns), the singlequbit readout fidelity (70 percent) and the single-qubit\nrelaxation time T1 (25 ns), and the limited two-qubit\nreadout fidelity, as used in the numerical simulations. Of\nparticular interest is that for simultaneous (within 2 ns)\n\n\f48\n\nFIG. 62: EPR anticorrelation in the singlet state\n\nA.\n\nFIG. 61: Interaction of the coupled qubits in the time domain.

The general principles are well known (see e.g.49,50 ) and have\nvery recently been successfully applied in several other\nsystems to achieve interesting and significant results\nin well-controlled quantum systems: ion-trap technology has been used to entangle 4 qubits180 , implement\n2-qubit gates and test Bell's inequalities181,184 , perform the Deutsch-Josza algorithm182 , achieve teleportation (within the system)185,186,187 , and perform error correction188; quantum optics has recently demonstrated long-distance teleportation190 as well as 4-photon\nentanglement190,191 . There are presently a considerable\ntheoretical literature on how to implement these and similar protocols and algorithms in JJ circits. Below we will\ndescribe a few examples to illustrate what may need to\nbe done experimentally.\n\nBell measurements\n\nThe first essential step is to study the quantum dynamics of a two-qubit circuit and to perform a test of\nBell's inequalities by creating entangled two-qubit Bell\nstates (Section III, Ref.49 ) and performing simultaneous\nprojective measurements on the two qubits, similarly to\nthe ion trap experiments181,184 . Clearly the experiment\nwill be a test of the quantum properties of the circuit\nand the measurement process rather than a test of a Bell\ninequality.\nThe general principle is to (a) entangle the two qubits,\n(b) measure the projection along different detector axes\n(\"polarization directions\"), (c) perform four independent\nmeasurements, and finally (d) analyze the correlations. If\nthe detector axes are fixed, as is the case for the JJ readout (measuring charge or flux), one can instead rotate\neach of the qubits.\nFigure 62 shows the quantum network for creating a\nBell state |\u03c8i, perform single qubit rotations Rx (\u03c61 ),\nRx (\u03c62 ), and finally perform a projective measurement on\neach of the qubits along the same common fixed quantization axis. For each setting of the angles, (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ),\non then performs a series of measurements obtaining the\nprobabilities Pij = |hij|\u03c8i|2 = h\u03c8|ijihij|\u03c8i. These can\nbe combined into the results for finding the two qubits\nin the same state, Psame = P00 + P11 , or in different\nstates, Pdif f = P01 + P10 , and finally into the difference\nq(\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) = Psame \u2212Pdif f . This quantity q(\u03c61 , \u03c62 ) is evaluated in four experiments for two independent settings\nof the two angles, \u03c61 = (\u03b1, \u03b4), \u03c62 = (\u03b2, \u03b3), constructing\nthe function\nB(\u03b1, \u03b4; \u03b2, \u03b3) = |q(\u03b1, \u03b2) + q(\u03b4, \u03b2)|\n+|q(\u03b1, \u03b3) \u2212 q(\u03b4, \u03b3)|\n\n(14.1)\n\nThe\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\n(CSCH)\ncondition192 for violation\u221a of classical physics is then\nB > 2 (maximum value 2 2).\nThe application to JJ charge-phase qubits has been\ndiscussed by Refs.193,194 . Experimentally, a first step\nin this direction has been taken by Martinis et al.178\nwho directly detected the anticorrelation in the oscillating superposition of Bell states |\u03c8(t)i = cos(\u03b4Et/2)|10i+\nsin(\u03b4Et/2)|01i.\n\n\f49\n\nFIG. 63: Teleportation in a 3-qubit system. The unknown\nqubit (1) to be teleported is |\u03c8i = a|0i + b|1i. The result\nof the measurement is sent by Alice via classical channels to\nBob who performs the appropriate unitary transformations to\nrestore the original single-qubit state. As a result of the teleportation, a specific but unknown state has been transferred\nfrom one qubit to another.\n\nFIG. 64: Teleportation in a 3-qubit system without measurement and classical transmission. The unknown qubit (1) to be\ntransferred is again |\u03c8i = a|0i+b|1i. The state of qubits 1 and\n2 are now used to control CNOT gates to restore the original\nsingle-qubit state on qubit 3. As a result of the teleportation,\na specific but unknown state has been transferred from qubit\n1 to qubit 3, leaving qubits 1 and 2 in superposition states.\n\nunitary transformation back to the original state:\nB.\n\nTeleportation\n\nIn the simplest form of teleportation an unknown\nsingle-qubit quantum state is transferred from one part\nof the system to another, i.e. from one qubit to another,\nas illustrated in Fig. 63. In Fig. 63, the initial state is\ngiven by\n(a|0i + b|1i)(|00i)\n\n(14.2)\n\nNext, applying CNOT and Hadamard gates entangles\nqubits 2 and 3 into a Bell state,\n(a|0i + b|1i)(1/ \u2217 2)(|00i + |11i)\n\n(14.3)\n\nwhich is the resource needed for teleportation (in quantum optics this corresponds to the entangled photon pair\nshared between Alice and Bob). One member of the Bell\npair (qubit 2) is now \"sent\" to Alice and entangled with\nthe unknown qubit to be teleported, creating a 3-qubit\nentangled state,\n|00i(a|0i + b|1i)\n+ |01i(b|0i + a|1i)\n+ |10i(a|0i \u2212 b|1i)\n+ |11i(\u2212b|0i + a|1i)\n\n(14.4)\n\nAt this point, qubit 3 is sent to Bob, meaning that a 3qubit entangled state is shared between Alice and Bob.\nMoreover, at this point, in each component of this 3-qubit\nentangled state in Eq. (14.4), the two upper qubits are in\neigenstates. This means that a projective measurement\nof the these two qubits by Alice will collapse the total\nstate to one of the four components. If the result of\nAlice's measurement is (ij), the first two qubits are in\nthe state |iji and the 3-qubit state is known, given by\nthe corresponding component in the previous equation.\nAny of these 3-qubit products can be transformed by a\n\nI(a|0i + b|1i) = |\u03c8i\n\u03c3x (b|0i + a|1i) = |\u03c8i\n\u03c3z (a|0i \u2212 b|1i) = |\u03c8i\n\u03c3z \u03c3x (\u2212b|0i + a|1i) = |\u03c8i\n\n(14.5)\n(14.6)\n(14.7)\n(14.8)\n\ncorresponding to resp. no change, bit flip, phase flip\nand bit-plus-phase flip of the original unknown state |\u03c8i.\nAlice's measurement causes instantaneous collapse, after\nwhich Alice by classical means (e.g. e-mail!) can tell\nBob which unitary transformation to apply to recover\nthe original single-qubit state.\nAn alternative approach, without measurement and\nclassical transmission, is shown in Fig. 64, In this case,\nthe final 3-qubit state is still a disentangled product state\nwith the correct state |\u03c8i = a|0i + b|1i on qubit 3,\n1\n1\n\u221a (|0i + |1i) \u221a (|0i + |1i)(a|0i + b|1i)\n2\n2\n\n(14.9)\n\nwhile qubits 1 and 2 are now in superposition states. If\ndesired, these states can be rotated back to |00i by single\nqubit gates.\nThe teleportation protocol has been implemented in\nion trap experiments186,187 (and of course in quantum\noptics189 ). A proposal for a setup for implementing a\nteleportation scheme in JJ circuitry is shown in Fig. 65,\ndescribing a 3-qubit chain of charge-phase qubits coupled\nby current-biased large JJ oscillators, in principle allowing controllable nearest-neighbour qubit couplings158,159 :\nIn the absence of bias currents, to first order the qubits\nare non-interacting and isolated from each other. The\nbasic two-qubit gates are achieved by switching on the\nbias-current-controlled qubit-qubit interaction for a given\ntime. CNOT gates can be achieved in combination with\nsingle-qubit Hadamard and phase gates158,159,160 . By applying the sequence of gates shown in Fig. 64 (or an\nequivalent sequence), the unknown state will be physically moved from the left end to the right end of the chain.\nMoreover, by applying coupling pulses simultaneously to\n\n\f50\n\nQubit i\u22121\n\n\u03c6\n\nb\ni\u22122\n\n\u03c6\n\n1(i\u22121)\n\nQubit i\n\nQubit i+1\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\n2(i\u22121)\n\nb\ni\u22121\n\n\u03c6\n\n1i\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\n2i\n\nCgi\n\nI bi\u22121\n\nb\ni\n1(i+1)\n\n\u03c6\n\n2(i+1)\n\nI bi\n\nVgi\n\nFIG. 65: Network of loop-shaped SCT charge qubits, coupled\nby large Josephson junctions.

However, with solid-state circuitry the\nissue becomes how to transfer entanglement among spatially fixed qubits.\nThe standard answer is to apply entangling two-qubit\ngates between distant qubits. The qubit-qubit interaction can be direct, e.g. dipole-dipole-type interaction between distant qubits, or mediated by excitations in the\nsystem. The transfer can be mediated via virtual or real\nexcitations in a passive polarizable medium, a \"system\nbus\", or via a protocol for coupling qubits and bus oscillators.\nA classic example of protocol-controlled oscillatormediated coupling is the Cirac-Zoller gate197 between\ntwo ions sequentially entangled via exchange coupling\nwith the lowest vibrational mode of the ions in the trap.\nAnother example is the Molmer-Sorensen gate198,199,200\nwhich creates qubit-qubit interaction via virtual excitation of ion-trap modes.\nSimilar concepts for\ncontrolling entanglement have recently been theoretically investigated in applications to JJ-qubit-oscillator\ncircuits164,201,202,203,204,205,206,207,208\nAn different approach is to allow the bus (\"spin-chain\")\nstates to develop in time governed by the fixed bus Hamiltonian and to tailor the interactions and the initital conditions such that useful dynamics and information transfer is achieved209,210,211,212 . Also these concepts have\nbeen applied to JJ-circuits in a number of recent the-\n\nD.\n\nQubit encoding and quantum error correction\n\nQuantum error correction (QEC) (see e.g.\nRefs.49,220,221,222,223,224,225,226 ) will most certainly\nbe necessary for successful operation of solid state quantum information devices in order to fight decoherence.\nThe algorithmic approach to QEC follows the principles\nof classical error correction, by encoding bits to create\nredundancy, and by devising procedures for identifying\nand correcting the errors based on specific models for\nthe errors.\nThe quantum circuit in Fig. 66 illustrates QEC in\nterms of five-qubit teleportation with bit errors, illustrating restoration of the state including error correction\nby measurement-controlled unitary transformation.\nThe quantum circuit in Fig. 67 demonstrates some\nessential steps of QEC in the case of one logical qubit\nencoded in three physical qubits: The first step is to\nencode the physical qubit in logical qubit basis states\n|000i and |111i by applying two CNOT gates to create a\n3-qubit entangled state:\n(a|0i + b|1i) |00i \u2192 (a|000i + b|111i)\n\n(14.10)\n\nNext, there may occur a bit-flip error in one of the qubits:\na|000i + b|111i (no bit f lip)\n\n(14.11)\n\n\f51\n\nFIG. 68: Coding, decoding and correcting a bit flip error in\n3-qubit logic qubit.\n\na|100i + b|011i (bit f lip in qubit 1)\na|010i + b|101i (bit f lip in qubit 2)\na|001i + b|110i (bit f lip in qubit 3)\n\n(14.12)\n(14.13)\n(14.14)\n\nThe next step applies a number of disentangling CNOT\ngates to check for the type of error. For the four possible\nstates above we obtain:\na|000i + b|111i \u2192 (a|0i + b|1i) |00i\na|100i + b|011i \u2192 (a|1i + b|0i) |11i\na|000i + b|111i \u2192 (a|0i + b|1i) |10i\na|000i + b|111i \u2192 (a|0i + b|1i) |01i\n\n(14.15)\n(14.16)\n(14.17)\n(14.18)\n\nAt this stage, qubits 2 and 3 have become independent\neigenstates, just as in teleportation. The corresponding eigenvalues are called syndrome, and indicate which\ncorrective operations should be implemented. Remarkably, in two of the above bit-flipped cases, with error\nsyndromes ((01) and (10), qubit 1 is now correct, the error residing in qubits 2 or 3 in the workspace (\"ancillas\").\nThe only case where a transformation is needed is when\nthe error syndrom is (11), which corresponds to a bit\nflip in qubit 1, to be corrected with a CCNOT (controlcontrol-NOT, or Toffoli, gate), controlled by the truth\ntable of an AND gate. In Fig. 67 we have used a compact single-gate notation for CCNOT, while in reality it\nmust be implemented through a sequence of eight twoqubit gates49 (there is no direct three-qubit interaction\nin the Hamiltonian). At this stage, the 3-qubit state is\ncompletely disentangled into a product state.\nThe final step consists in re-encoding the physical qubit\n1 to the logical qubit a|000i + b|111i. However, although\nthe physical qubit 1 is always correct at this stage, the\nworkspace is not. This can be handled in a number of\nways. Figure 67 dumps the \"hot\" qubits in the garbage\ncan (i.e. leaves them, or forces them, to relax), and\nre-encodes with fresh qubits from a larger workspace.\nAlternatively, Fig. 68 describes a variation where the old\nqubits 2 and 3 are re-initialized by entanglement with a\nmeasurement device which then dissipates the heat from\nthe bitflip and the error correction procedure.\nIn both of these cases, as described, we need a total\nworkspace with five qubits. In principle, however, one\ncan do with three qubits if we can rapidly re-initialize\n\nqubits 2 and 3 without inducing new errors. Recently\nan error correcting procedure with cooling of the system\nwithout measurement has been proposed227 .\nPhase flips (sign changes), e.g. a|0i+ b|1i \u2192 a|0i\u2212 b|1i\ncan be handled by similar 3-qubit encoding, decoding and\ncorrection. Combining these two approaches gives the 9qubit Shor code220 for correcting also combined bit and\nphase flips, e.g. a|0i + b|1i \u2192 a|1i \u2212 b|0i. The minimum\ncode to achieve the same thing is a 5-qubit code221 and\nthere are more efficient codes with 7 qubits223,224,225 .\nA related approach to fighting decoherence is to encode the quantum information in noiseless subsystems,\nso called Decoherence Free Subspaces (DFS)124,125,228,229\nA different approach is the so called \"bang-bang\"\ndynamic correction method230,231,232,233,234,235 , basically\ncorresponding to very frequent application of the spinecho technique. This is related to the quantum Zeno\neffect (see e.g. Ref.236 , describing situations where the\nquantum system via very strong interaction with the environment is forced into a subspace from where it cannot\ndecay.\nIn this Section we have restricted the discussion to\na few different protocols for quantum state engineering,\nrepresenting basic steps in algorithms for solving specific\ncomputational problems. For a discussion of quantum\nalgorithms and computational complexity we refer to the\nbooks by Nielsen and Chuang49 and Gruska50 , and to\nthe original papers. We would however like to mention a\nfew papers discussing how to implement a few well-know\nalgorithms in JJ circuitry. The basics of quantum gates\nin JJ-circuits can be found in e.g. Refs.42,237,238 . The\nDeutsch-Josza (DJ) and related algorithms have been\ndiscussed by Siewert and Fazio238 describing a 3-qubit\nDJ implementation with three charge-phase qubits connected in a ring via phase-coupling JJs with variable\nJosephson coupling energy (SQUIDS), and by Schuch\nand Siewert analyzing a 4-qubit implementation239 . For\nthe Grover search algorithm there seems to be nothing\npublished on the implementation in JJ circuitry. Concerning Shor's factorization algorithm there is a recent\npaper by Vartiainen et al.242 . There is also recent work\non optimization of two-qubit gates243 , and relations between error correction and entanglement208 .\nFinally there are a number of papers connecting JJciruits wih geometric phases and holononomic quantum\ncomputing246,247,248,249 and on adiabatic computation252\nand Cooper pair pumps250,251 . For a recent paper discussing the universality of adiabatic quantum computing,\nsee Aharonov et al.253 .\n\nXV.\n\nCONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nWithin 5 years, engineered JJ quantum systems with\n5-10 qubits will most likely begin seriously to test the\nscalability of solid state QI processors.\nFor this to happen, a few decisive initial steps and\nbreakthroughs are needed and expected: The first essen-\n\n\f52\ntial step is to develop JJ-hardware with long coherence\ntime to study the quantum dynamics of a two-qubit circuit and to perform a \"test\" of Bell's inequalities (or\nrather the JJ-ciruitry) by creating entangled two-qubit\nBell states and performing simultaneous projective measurements on the two qubits.\nA first breakthrough would be to perform a significant\nnumber of single- and two-qubit gates on a 3-qubit cluster to entangle three qubits. Combined with simultaneous projective readout of individual qubits, not disturbing unmeasured qubits, this would form a basis for the\nfirst solid-state experiments with teleportation, quantum\nerror correction (QEC), and elementary quantum algorithms. This will provide a platform for scaling up the\nsystem to 10 qubits.\nThis may not look very impressive but nevertheless\nwould be an achievement far beyond expectations only\na decade back. The NMR successes, e.g. running Shortype algorithms using a molecule with 7 qubits76 , are\nbased on technologies developed during 50 years using\nnatural systems with naturally long coherence times.\nSimilarly, semiconductor technologies have developed for\n50 years to reach today's scale and performance of classical computers. It is therefore to be expected that QI\ntechnologies will need several decades to develop truly\nsignificant potential. Moreover, in the same way as for\nthe classical technologies, QI technologies will most probably develop slowly step by step, \"qubit by qubit\", which\nin itself will be an exponential development.\nMoreover, in future scalable information processors,\ndifferent physical realizations and technologies might be\ncombined into hybrid systems to achieve fast processing\nin one system and long coherence and long-time information storage in another system. In this way, solid state\ntechnologies might be combined with ion trap physics to\nbuild large microtrap systems254 , which in turn might be\ncoupled to superconducting Josephson junctions processors via microwave transmission lines255 .\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has been supported by European Commission through the IST-SQUBIT and SQUBIT-2 projects,\nby the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research and the Royal Academy of\nSciences.\n\nGLOSSARY\n\nAdiabatic evolution - Development of a quantum system without transitions among the quantum levels.\nAlgorithm - Finite sequence of logical operations, which\nproduces a solution for a given problem.\nLevel crossing - Degeneracy of quantum levels appearing at a certain value of a controlling system parameter\n(e.g. gate voltage, bias flux, etc.).\n\nAnticrossing - Lifting of degeneracy (level crossing) of\nquantum levels during variation of the system parameters\nwhen an interaction is switched on\nAverage measurement - Measurement of an expectation value of a dynamic variable in a certain state\nBloch sphere - Geometrical representation of the manifold of quantum states of a two-level system as points\non the unit sphere.\nBloch vector - Normalized state vector of a two-level\nsystem represented by a radial unit vector of the Bloch\nsphere.\nCharging energy - Electrostatic energy of a capacitor\ncharged with a single electron (e) (or a single Cooper pair\n(2e)).\nCharge qubit - Superconducting qubit based on a a\nsingle Cooper pair box (SCB), whose computational basis\nconsists of the two charge states of the superconducting\nisland.\nCharge-phase qubit - Superconducting qubit based on\na single Cooper pair box (SCB) whose charging energy is\nof the order of the Josephson energy of tunnel junctions\nCNOT gate - Controlled-NOT gate: two-qubit gate\nwhich changes or does not change the state of a target\nqubit depending on the state of a controlling qubit.\nCooper pair - Bound state of two electrons (2e), the\nelementary charge carrier in superconducting equilibrium\nstate.\nCoulomb blockade - Suppression of current through\na tunnel junction or small metallic island due to large\ncharging energy associated with a passage of a single electron.\nCPHASE gate - Controlled-phase gate: two-qubit gate\nwhich changes or does not change the phase of a target\nqubit depending on the state of a controlling qubit.\nDecoherence - Evolution of a quantum system, interacting with its environment;
