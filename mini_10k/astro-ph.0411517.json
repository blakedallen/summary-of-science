Butcher and Oemler's work had a strong impact since it showed direct evidence for the evolution of cluster galaxies. Later, Rakos and\nSchombert (1995) found that the fraction of blue galaxies increases from 20% at z=0.4 to 80% at z=0.9, suggesting that\nthe evolution in clusters is even stronger than the original\nButcher-Oemler effect. Margoniner and de Carvalho (2000)\nstudied 48 clusters in the redshift range of 0.03< z <0.38,\nand detected a strong Butcher-Oemler effect consistent with\nthat of Rakos and Schombert (1995).\nAlthough the detection of the Butcher\u2013Oemler effect\nhas been claimed in various studies, there have been some\nsuggestions of strong selection biases in the cluster samples.\nNewberry, Kirshner, and Boroson (1988) measured the velocity dispersions and surface densities of galaxies in clusters, and found a marked difference between local clusters\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:tomo@jhu.edu\n\nand intermediate redshift clusters. More recently, Andreon\nand Ettori (1999) measured the X-ray surface brightness\nprofiles, sizes and luminosities of the Butcher\u2013Oemler sample of clusters, and concluded that the sample is not uniform.\nIt is a concern that these selection biases may smear evolutionary trends. Especially, Margoniner et al. (2001) and\nGoto et al. (2003a) found that the blue fraction depends on\ncluster richness. If richer, and thus more massive, clusters\nhave lower fractions of blue galaxies, cluster samples with a\nMalmquist-type bias naturally have an erroneously weaker\nredshift trend since distant cluster tend to be more massive\ndue to the selection effect. Thus, in order to reveal the true\nredshift evolution, it is important to clarify if blue fraction\ndepends on cluster mass or not.\nRecently, as a modern version of the Butcher-Oemler\neffect, the evolution the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxy\nclusters has been actively debated (e.g., Kodama & Bower\n2001). Postman et al. (1998;2001) found that a large number\nof cluster members show high levels of star formation activity, and that the average SFR is higher in z \u223c 0.9 clusters\nthan in low redshift clusters. Finn et al. (2004) imaged the\ngalaxy cluster Cl0023+0423B at z = 0.845 through narrowband (H\u03b1) filter and found that the integrated SFR normal-\n\n\f2\n\nT. Goto\n\nFigure 1. Emission line ratios used to remove AGNs from our\nsample. The dashed line is the criterion between starbursts and\nAGNs described in Kewley et al. (2001). Galaxies with line ratios higher than the dashed line are removed from our sample as\nAGNs.\n\nized by cluster mass (\u03a3SF R/Mcl ) is a factor of 10 higher\nthan that of z \u223c 0.2 clusters in the literature. However,\nthese studies have been hampered by the same degeneracy\nbetween mass dependence and redshift dependence; Finn et\nal. (2004) also found \u03a3SF R/Mcl depends on cluster mass,\nin addition to the redshift. Therefore, it has not been clear\nif the variation in cluster SFR is caused by cluster mass or\nredshift evolution.\nIn this Letter, we aim to clarify the mass dependence\nof the Butcher\u2013Oemler effect (blue fractions) and the total\nSFR of clusters using an extremely large number of clusters at low redshift. Recently, using 250,000 spectra in the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey Data Relase 2 (SDSS; Abazajian\net al. 2004), a large cluster catalog with 335 clusters with\nat least 20 spectroscopic members has been compiled (Goto\n2005a; see also Goto et al. 2002a,b for a SDSS cluster catalog). This catalog provides us with a good opportunity to\ninvestigate whether the blue fraction and \u03a3SF R depend on\ncluster mass or not using a statistically large sample (c.f.,\nprevious samples consisted of only a few to dozens of clusters). The results provide an important constraint on the\nphysical mechanism associated with cluster mass, in addition to an important basis in studying redshift evolution of\nthese quantities using high redshift clusters.\nThe cosmological parameters adopted throughout this\npaper are H0 =71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and (\u03a9m ,\u03a9\u039b )=(0.27,0.73)\n(Bennett et al. 2003).\n\nmember galaxies as faint as Mr = \u221220.38 in a volume limited way since the SDSS is flux-limited spectroscopic survey\nto the depth of r = 17.77. We use Petrosian magnitudes\nk-corrected using Blanton et al. (2003;v3 2) and corrected\nfor galactic extinction using reddening map of Schlegel,\nFinkbeiner & Davis (1998). The actual number of clusters\nused is 115, which is the largest number of spectroscopic\nclusters used to study the Butcher-Oemler effect. We restrict\ncluster member galaxies to those within the virial radius of\nthe cluster (computed using Girardi et al. 1998), and within\n3\u03c3 of the velocity dispersion. This radial normalization is\nimportant since the fraction of blue/late-type galaxies is a\nstrong function of radius (e.g., Goto et al. 2003c; Goto et al.\n2004), and thus, using different radius of each cluster could\nproduce a false trend. Assuming each cluster is virialized, we\ncompute virial mass (MV ) of each cluster using the virial radius and the velocity dispersion (given in Goto et al. 2005a)\nusing the prescription given in Girardi et al. (1998).\nWe also compute SFR of each cluster galaxies from H\u03b1\nluminosity (measured using Goto et al. 2003b) using the prescription given in Hopkins et al. (2003). Goto et al. (2005a)\nmeasured H\u03b1 flux using the flux summing technique described in Goto et al. (2003b). In order to correct for stellar\nabsorption, we used H\u03b4 equivalent width (EW) measured in\nGoto et al. (2005a), and converted it to the stellar absorption\nat H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 using the following empirical relation (Miller\n& Owen 2002): H\u03b2 EWabsorption is equal to H\u03b4 EWabsorption\nand H\u03b1 EWabsorption is equal to 1.3 + 0.4\u00d7 H\u03b4 EWabsorption\n(Keel 1983). Using the stellar absorption corrected H\u03b1/H\u03b2\nflux ratio, we correct for dust extinction using the prescription given in Hopkins et al. (2003). We apply this extinction\ncorrection only when both H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 lines are in emission.\nFinally we apply the 3\" fiber aperture correction by scaling the H\u03b1 flux by the ratio of the Petrosian r-band flux\nto that measured within the 3\" fiber. By using this stellar\nabsorption, dust extinction, aperture corrected H\u03b1 flux to\nthe equation given in Kennicutt (1998), we obtain a SFR for\neach cluster galaxy.\nWhen we compute total SFRs, we exclude AGNs using\nthe prescription given in Kewley et al. (2001). Fig.1 shows\nline ratios of [OIII](5008\u00c5)/H\u03b2 versus [NII](6585\u00c5)/H\u03b1.\nThe dotted line is the criterion used to divide AGNs and\nstarbursts proposed by Kewley et al. (2001). Here, we use\nthe flux measured by the SDSS pipeline (Stoughton et al.\n2002) since for strong emission lines, the Gaussian fit by the\npipeline works well (Goto et al. 2003b). We take a conservative approach in excluding AGNs. We only exclude a galaxy\nas an AGN when all four lines are detected in emission and\nthe line ratio is above the dotted line in Fig.1. We have also\nchecked that rejecting more AGNs using only 2 lines does\nnot change our results.\n\n3\n2\n\nDATA & ANALYSIS\n\nRecently, a large cluster catalog of \u223c 335 clusters with at\nleast 20 spectroscopic members has been compiled by Goto\n(2005a) using \u223c250,000 spectra of the SDSS DR2. From\nthis catalog, we select clusters with z 6 0.09 and >20 spectroscopic members. This redshift range allows us to probe\n\n3.1\n\nRESULTS\nBlue/Late-type Fraction as a Function of\nMass\n\nIn this section, we investigate if the blue fraction (the\nButcher-Oemler effect) depends on cluster mass. We separate blue and red galaxies using the restframe u \u2212 r = 2.22\ncolour. Strateva et al. (2001) showed that this colour is\n\n\fDo star formation rates of galaxy clusters depend on mass?\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. Fraction of blue galaxies as a function of cluster mass,\nA typical size of error bars is shown at the upper right corner of\nthe plot. Spearman's correlation coefficient is 0.09.\n\nFigure 3. Fraction of late-type galaxies (Cin > 0.4) as a function\nof cluster mass. A typical size of error bars is shown at the upper\nright corner of the plot. Spearman's correlation coefficient is -0.08.\n\nthe local minimum of the bimodal distribution of red/blue\ngalaxies (Baldry et al. 2004), and thus it separates earlyand late-type galaxies well at z < 0.4. Fig. 2 shows the ratio\nof blue (u \u2212 r < 2.22) galaxies to all galaxies in each cluster as a function of cluster mass. A median size of the error\nbars is shown in the upper right corner of the plot. As can\nbe seen, there is no obvious trend of the blue fraction with\ncluster mass. Indeed, Spearman's correlation coefficient is as\nsmall as 0.09.\nIn Fig.3, we plot the fraction of morphologically latetype galaxies (fCin ) as a function of cluster mass. Here, latetype galaxies are selected using the concentration parameter\n(Cin), which is defined as a ratio of Petrosian 50% light radius to Petrosian 90% light radius. This parameter, Cin, is\nknown to be well correlated with eye-classified morphology\n(Shimasaku et al. 2001; Strateva et al. 2001), and thus has\nbeen used in many previous studies (e.g., Gomez et al. 2003;\nKauffman et al. 2004; Tanaka et al. 2004). We regard galaxies with Cin > 0.4 as late-type galaxies and compare the\nfraction to the number of all galaxies. As in the previous\nfigure, the median error bar is shown in the upper right corner of Fig.3. There is no clear trend of mass dependence in\nFig.3. Spearman's correlation coefficient is -0.08.\n\nr < 17.77 in correcting spectroscopic incompleteness, i.e.,\nwe use all spectroscopic galaxies regardless of the redshift\nand all the galaxies in the imaging data with r < 17.77.\nThis correction is about factor of 2-3, and does not depend\non cluster mass. Due to this correction, although the SDSS\ndoes not take spectra of all galaxies in the cluster area (the\nadjacent SDSS fibers cannot be closer than 55\"), the computed amount of total SFR is statistically corrected to the\ntrue total amount of SFR in cluster region in the range of\nMr 6 \u221220.38. The error bars shown in the figure are based\non the number of galaxies contributing to the sum. In Fig.4,\nthere is no apparent correlation between total SFR (\u03a3SF R)\nand the cluster mass. Spearman's correlation coefficient is\n0.23.\nFollowing a recent trend (Finn et al. 2004; Kodama\net al. 2004), we plot \u03a3SF R normalized by cluster mass\n(\u03a3SF R/Mcl ) in Fig.5. The plot looks as if there is a decreasing trend in \u03a3SF R/Mcl with increasing cluster mass.\nHowever, Spearman's correlation coefficient is as small as 0.12, and thus, the apparent correlation is hardly significant.\nA more notable feature is the large amount of scatter among\nthe cluster sample.\n\n3.2\n\n4\n\nTotal SFR as a Function of Cluster Mass\n\nNext, we investigate the SFR in clusters as a function of\ncluster mass. The SFRs of cluster member galaxies are computed using the method described in Section 2.\nIn Fig.4, we sum all the SFRs of cluster member galaxies with Mr 6 \u221220.38 to plot total amount of SFRs in a\ncluster against cluster mass. Here, we correct for incompleteness in spectroscopic targeting of the SDSS by multiplying\nby the ratio of all galaxies in angular area of the cluster in\nthe imaging data to all spectroscopic galaxies in the same\nregion of the sky. Since we do not know the redshift for\ngalaxies in the imaging data, we use magnitude range of\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn Section 3, we found that both blue fractions and late-type\nfractions do not significantly depend on cluster mass (Figs.\n2 and 3). We also found that \u03a3SF R and \u03a3SF R/Mcl do not\ndepend on cluster mass (Figs 4 and 5). It has been known\nthat if blue fractions or SFR of clusters depend on cluster\nmass, such observational evidence could be interpreted as\nevidence for the ram-pressure stripping mechanism (Fujita\n2004; Fujita & Goto 2004), which mainly alters the SFR of\ngalaxies, and thus, the blue fraction. In a simple estimation,\nthe ram-pressure is proportional to \u03c1v 2 . LX is proportional\nto \u03c12 . From the virial theorem, v 2 \u221d T . The LX \u2013T rela-\n\n\f4\n\nT. Goto\n\nFigure 4.

Incompleteness in spectroscopic observation is\ncorrected using the number ratio of galaxies with spectra and\ngalaxies in the SDSS imaging data.

Incompleteness in spectroscopic observation is corrected using the\nnumber ratio of galaxies with spectra and galaxies in the SDSS\nimaging data. Spearman's correlation coefficient is -0.12.\n\ntion studied by Xue and Wu (2000) is LX \u221d T 2.8 . Therefore, the ram-pressure is proportional to \u223c L0.86\nX , i.e., the\nram-pressure is stronger for more X-ray luminous, and thus\nmassive, clusters. Therefore, if the ram-pressure stripping is\nthe only mechanism responsible for the colour evolution of\ngalaxies in clusters, the fraction of blue galaxies should always be lower in more X-ray luminous clusters, which therefore are more massive clusters (Fujita & Nagashima 1999).\n\nTherefore, our findings of no mass dependence of blue fractions and \u03a3SF R suggests that the ram-pressure stripping is\nnot the only dominant physical mechanism that drives the\ncluster galaxy colour evolution.\nIn addition, tidal stripping by the gravitational potential of the cluster can also strip gas in the galaxy disk, and\nconsequently can halt the SFR in the galaxy (e.g., Gnedin\n2003a,b). This tidal stripping effect (again mainly affects\nblue fractions and \u03a3SF R) should also depend on the cluster\nmass. Statistically, stronger tidal forces are expected in more\nmassive clusters, and thus, massive clusters should have\nmore evolved galaxies (see equation 16 in Gnedin 2003a). In\nfact, in the simulation by Moore et al. (1999), stronger tidal\nevolution is found in larger clusters. Therefore, our findings\nmay indicate that tidal stripping may not be a key physical\nmechanism. Similarly, galaxy-galaxy merging should also be\nmore effective in clusters with smaller velocity dispersion\n(Makino & Hut 1997); and thus, the galaxy-galaxy merging\nmechanism, which affects galaxy morphology mainly, may\nbe dis-favored as well by our discovery of no mass dependence of the late-type fractions.\nOur results, however, are inconsistent with some previous work which found that blue fractions are lower for richer\nclusters (Margoniner et al. 2001; Goto et al. 2003a). Possible sources of discrepancy are: (i) their use of imaging data\nwith a background subtraction technique in assessing the\nblue fractions; (ii) different magnitude range probed, i.e.,\nMargoniner et al. (2001) probed as faint as M \u2217 + 2, whereas\nour work is limited to Mr 6 \u221220.38. Especially, Tanaka et\nal. (2005) found different morphology-SFR-density relations\nfor faint and bright galaxies, and thus, the difference in the\nmagnitude range is a possible source of the apparent discrepancy. Mart\u0131\u0301nez et al. (2002) found a strong correlation\nbetween the relative fraction of galaxies with high SFR and\nthe parent group mass using 2209 galaxy groups found in\n2dF. However, their sample consisted of poor groups with\nnot much overlap with the mass range we probed. On the\nother hand, Fairley et al. (2002) studied eight X-ray selected\nclusters, and did not find any dependence of blue fractions\non X-ray luminosities. Recently, De Propris et al. (2004)\nfound that blue fractions in 60 clusters in the 2dFGRS do\nnot depend on cluster velocity dispersions. These results are\nconsistent with ours although they are based on fewer number of clusters.\nOur results imply that there is no strong need to correct\nfor the mass dependence when one studies redshift evolution\nof fb or \u03a3SF R. However, the large scatter seen in Figs. 2-5\ncautions not to mis-interpret a noise caused by the scatter as\na redshift trend. The sample presented in Finn et al. (2004)\nand Kodama et al. (2004) consists of only 4 and 5 clusters.\nEagerly awaited are statistical numbers of clusters at high\nredshift with SFR measurements.\nFinally this work provides a good local comparison sample to future high redshift cluster studies. Since currently\navailable high-z cluster \u03a3SF Rs are limited by the H\u03b1 luminosity (due to the narrow band H\u03b1 imaging with no strict\nabsolute magnitude limit), it is not straight-forward to compare. However, with all the caveats in mind, if we forcefully\napply suggested corrections of 70-80% in \u03a3SF R between\na H\u03b1 imaging survey and a spectroscopic survey (Homeier et al. in prep.), majority of our clusters has estimated\n\u03a3SF R/Mcl of < 20 \u00d71014 M\u2299 , which is much smaller than\n\n\fDo star formation rates of galaxy clusters depend on mass?\nthat of z = 0.8 (Finn et al. 2004). However, a truly meaningful comparison has to be postponed until one has both low\nand high redshift sample observed with the same technique.\nOnce one has the \u03a3SF R of high redshift clusters applying\nthe magnitude limit of Mr 6 \u221220.38, it should be easy to\ncompare with our low redshift sample, and to study redshift\nevolution.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have investigated blue/late-type fractions, total SFR\nand total SFR normalized by mass for 115 clusters (z 6\n0.09) carefully selected from the SDSS DR2. We found that\nall of the above quantities do not significantly depend on\ncluster virial mass. Therefore, our results suggests that the\nphysical mechanisms that depend on cluster mass are not\nfavored to be responsible for cluster galaxy evolution. The\nlack of mass trend implies that previously found redshift\ntrends can be interpreted as a redshift evolution instead of\nmass dependence. However, our findings of large scatter in\neach quantity cautions us not to mis-interpret noise caused\nby the scatter as a redshift trend. In order to investigate redshift evolution of cluster SFRs, much larger samples of high\nredshift clusters are needed. Our results provide an excellent\nbenchmark for such future high redshift cluster studies.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Dr. Ani Thakar for his friendly help in downloading the publicly available SDSS data.
