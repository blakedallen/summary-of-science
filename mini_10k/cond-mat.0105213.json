We study morphologies of thin-film diblock copolymers between two flat and parallel walls.\nThe study is restricted to the weak segregation regime below the order-disorder transition temperature.\nThe deviation from perfect lamellar shape is calculated for phases which are perpendicular and parallel\nto the walls. We examine the undulations of the inter material dividing surface and its angle with the\nwalls, and find that the deviation from its unperturbed position can be much larger than in the strong\nsegregation case. Evaluating the weak segregation stability of the lamellar phases, it is shown that a\nsurface interaction, which is quadratic in the monomer concentration, favors the perpendicular lamellar\nphase. In particular, the degeneracy between perpendicular and unfrustrated parallel lamellar phases for\nwalls without a preferential adsorption is removed.\n\nPACS. 61.25.Hq Macromolecular and polymer solutions; polymer melts; swelling. \u2013 61.41.+e Polymers,\nelastomers, and plastics. \u2013 68.55.-a Thin films structure and morphology.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nfield theory, the bulk phase diagram is governed by two\nparameters: f = NA /N , the fraction of the A-block in a\n\nDiblock copolymers (BCP) are made up of two chemically\ndistinct chains covalently bonded together.

In\nparticular, we derive the deviation of the perpendicular\nand parallel lamellae from their bulk shape. In Sec. 2 we\nintroduce a model free energy and derive the underlying\nequations.
