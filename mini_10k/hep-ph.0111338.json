Spin-flavor symmetry for baryons is formally an exact symmetry\nin the t'Hooft large-Nc limit [3]. For finite Nc , the spin-flavor symmetry of baryons is\nonly approximate and is broken explicitly by corrections suppressed by powers of 1/Nc .\nThe breaking of the large-Nc baryon spin-flavor symmetry for QCD baryons is order\n1/Nc = 1/3, which is comparable to the order 30% breaking of Gell-Mann SU (3) flavor\nsymmetry. Thus, spin-flavor symmetry is as good an approximate symmetry for QCD\nbaryons as SU (3) flavor symmetry.\nSpin-flavor symmetry for QCD baryons has a long history; like SU (3) flavor symmetry, spin-flavor symmetry predates the formulation of QCD. Although spin-flavor symmetry was phenomenologically successful early on [4], the physical basis for spin-flavor\nsymmetry was not understood, even after the microscopic theory of the strong interactions was known. What has been possible in recent years is to justify spin-flavor symmetry as a bona fide symmetry of baryons in QCD, and to classify the explicit breakings\nof baryon spin-flavor symmetry to all orders in the 1/Nc expansion in a systematic and\nquantitative manner. It has been shown that the quark-gluon dynamics of large-Nc QCD\ngives rise to a spin-flavor symmetry for baryons. For finite Nc , the symmetry is only\napproximate; there are subleading 1/Nc corrections which explicitly break the symmetry. This new insight has led to the formulation of the baryon 1/Nc expansion as an\nexpansion in operators with definite transformation properties under baryon spin and\nflavor symmetry. Each baryon operator in the 1/Nc expansion occurs at a known order\nin 1/Nc . Each operator is multiplied by an unknown coefficient which is a reduced matrix element that is not determined by baryon spin-flavor symmetry. Calculating these\nreduced baryon matrix elements is tantamount to solving QCD in the baryon sector.\n\n\fAll of the new results obtained for baryons in the 1/Nc expansion can be characterized\nas symmetry relations involving spin and flavor. The spin-flavor structure of the baryon\n1/Nc expansion yields model-independent results which are valid for QCD. It has been\nknown for some time that the spin-flavor group theory for baryons in large-Nc QCD and\nin the large-Nc quark and Skyrme models is the same[5]. It is now known that a stronger\nstatement applies: the spin-flavor structure of the baryon 1/Nc expansion is the same in\nQCD as in the quark model and the Skyrme model at each order in the 1/Nc expansion.\nIn other words, the spin-flavor structure of the baryon 1/Nc expansion is the same in\nQCD as in the quark model and Skyrme models. QCD and these models, however, will\ndiffer in their predictions for the reduced matrix elements of the baryon 1/Nc expansion.\nIt is well known that the quark and Skyrme models are not very successful at predicting\nthese reduced matrix elements, which leads to the conclusion that most, if not all, of\nthe successful predictions of the non-relativistic quark and Skyrme models are actually\nmodel-independent group-theoretic predictions, and therefore should not be regarded as\nevidence for the validity of these models per se.\nThe spin-flavor operator analysis of the baryon 1/Nc expansion has resulted in significant progress in understanding of the spin-flavor structure of baryons. It explains the\nextraordinary accuracy of many venerable spin-flavor and flavor symmetry relations for\nbaryons as being due to the presence of 1/Nc suppression factors in addition to the usual\nflavor symmetry breaking suppression factors. It is remarkable that, after three decades,\na quantitative understanding of spin-flavor symmetry for baryons has been achieved.\nThe outline of these lectures is as follows. First, a brief summary is given of the 1/Nc\nexpansion of large-Nc QCD. The 1/Nc power counting of the quark-gluon dynamics\nof large-Nc QCD is described for the confined quark-gluon bound states: mesons and\nbaryons. Second, it is shown that large-Nc baryons satisfy a contracted spin-flavor\nsymmetry in the Nc \u2192 \u221e limit. Baryon states transform as irreducible representations of\nthe spin-flavor algebra, and operators acting on a baryon spin-flavor multiplet transform\nas irreducible tensor operators of the algebra.\nThe formalism of the baryon 1/Nc expansion is presented in the next section. Tensor\noperators acting on a baryon spin-flavor multiplet have an expansion in terms of operator\nproducts of the baryon spin-flavor generators. The order in 1/Nc of each operator product\nin the 1/Nc expansion is known. Not all operator products of the baryon spin-flavor\ngenerators are linearly independent, so it is necessary to eliminate redundant operator\nproducts using operator identities. This operator reduction is possible in terms of the\noperator identities for 2-body operator products. The complete set of 2-body operator\nproduct identities for SU (6) spin-flavor symmetry is given, and then used to construct\noperator bases for the baryon 1/Nc expansion.\n1/Nc operator-product expansions are constructed for a number of baryon tensor operators in the final section. It is necessary to incorporate SU (3) flavor symmetry breaking\ninto the baryon 1/Nc expansion since SU (3) breaking is comparable to the expansion\nparameter 1/Nc . The 1/Nc expansions for baryon masses, axial vector couplings and\nmagnetic moments are presented in detail. A comparison of experimental data with the\npredictions of the combined 1/Nc and flavor-symmetry breaking expansion is given in\nthese cases. The presence of 1/Nc suppression factors in the experimental data is clearly\nevident, and provides a quantitative understanding of the accuracy of famous symmetry\nrelations, such as the Gell-Mann\u2013Okubo formula, Gell-Mann's Equal Spacing Rule and\n\n\fFIGURE 1. Double line notation for a gluon.\n\nthe Coleman-Glashow relation for baryon masses, as well as many others.\nThe focus of these lectures is on the application of the 1/Nc expansion to QCD\nbaryons. The discussion is meant to be complementary to my review of large-Nc baryons\n[6], which is more comprehensive. The emphasis here is on baryons in QCD with NF = 3\nflavors of light quarks. I will try to keep the formalism introduced to a minimum throughout, although a fair amount is essential and cannot be avoided. Of necessity, a number of\nimportant topics have not been covered, even briefly. These topics include nonet symmetry of baryon amplitudes [29], exact cancellations in baryon chiral perturbation theory\n[44], spin-flavor symmetry of excited baryons [15], and spin-flavor symmetry of heavy\nquark baryons [31]. An extensive list of publications on the spin and flavor properties of\nbaryons in the 1/Nc expansion is given in the references.\n\nLARGE-NC QCD\nA recent review of large-Nc QCD can be found in Ref. [7], so the presentation here will\nbe brief.\nLarge-Nc QCD is defined as the generalization of SU (3) gauge theory of quarks and\ngluons to SU (Nc) gauge theory. The naive generalization of the QCD Lagrangian is\ngiven by\nNF\n\u0001\n1\n/\u2212mf qf,\n(1)\nL = \u2212 Tr G\u03bc\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd + \u2211 q\u0304 f i D\n2\nf =1\nwhere the gauge field strength and the covariant derivative, D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + igA\u03bc , are defined\nas in QCD. For SU (Nc) gauge theory, the gluons appear in the adjoint represention of\nSU (Nc) with dimension (Nc2 \u2212 1) while the quarks appear in the fundamental representation Nc . Thus, there are O(Nc ) more gluon degrees of freedom than quark degrees of\nfreedom in large-Nc QCD.\nThe 1/Nc power counting of quark-gluon diagrams is readily obtained by introducing\nt'Hooft double line notation for the gluon gauge field: the adjoint index A on the gauge\nfield (A\u03bc )A is replaced by fundamental and anti-fundamental indices i and j, so that\nthe gauge field is written as (A\u03bc )ij , a substitution which is valid up to corrections\nwhich are subleading in the 1/Nc expansion. In double line notation, the gluon is\neffectively replaced by a quark line and an antiquark line, as shown in Fig. 1. When\na quark-gluon Feynman diagram is rewritten in double line notation, determining the\npower in Nc of the diagram is equivalent to counting the number of closed quark\nloops with unrestricted color summations. Fig. 2 gives an explicit example of this 1/Nc\n\n\fFIGURE 2.\n\ncounting. The diagram shown in Fig. 2 reduces to three quark loops, and is therefore\nproportional to Nc3 . In addition, the diagram is proportional to four powers of the quarkgluon coupling constant g, since the diagram contains four vertices, each of which is\n\u00012\nproportional to g. Thus, the overall diagram is proportional to g4 Nc3 = g2 Nc Nc . A\nsimple analysis of other diagrams leads to the t'Hooft result that vacuum Feynman\ndiagrams are proportional to\n\u0001 1 V +V\n(2)\ng2 Nc 2 3 4 Nc\u03c7 ,\n\nwhere Vn is the number of n-point vertices in the diagram and \u03c7 is the Euler character of\nthe diagram. Consequently, diagrams with arbitrary numbers of 3- and 4-point vertices\ngrow with arbitrarily large powers of Nc unless the limit Nc \u2192 \u221e is taken with g2 Nc\nheld fixed. This limiting procedure, which is necessary to define SU (Nc) gauge theory\nin the large-Nc limit, is known as the t'Hooft limit. The\u221aconstraint g2 Nc held fixed can\nbe implemented by rescaling the gauge coupling g \u2192 g/ Nc in the original Lagrangian.\n\u03c7\nAfter this rescaling, Feynman diagrams will be proportional to Nc , where the Euler\ncharacter \u03c7 = 2 \u2212 2H \u2212 L can be computed in terms of the number of handles H and\nquark loops L of a given diagram. The t'Hooft limit leads to the following results:\nFor finite and large Nc , planar diagrams with H = 0 dominate the dynamics. (All\nplanar diagrams with a given L are of the same order.)\n\u2022 Diagrams with nonplanar gluon exchange (H 6= 0) are suppressed relative to planar\ndiagrams by one factor of 1/Nc2 for each nonplanar gluon.\n\u2022 Diagrams with quark loops (L 6= 0) are suppressed by one factor of 1/Nc for each\nquark loop.\n\u2022\n\nThe dynamics of large-Nc QCD is presumed to be confining. The \u03b2 function of\nlarge-Nc QCD implies that the rescaled coupling gets large at some scale, let us call it\n\u039bQCD . For E \u2264 O(\u039bQCD ), large-Nc QCD is strongly coupled and is expected to exhibit\nconfinement. The confined theory contains colorless bound states: mesons, baryons and\nglueballs. The 1/Nc power counting for large-Nc mesons and for baryons is summarized\nbelow.\nA meson in large-Nc QCD is created with unit amplitude by the operator\n1 Nc\n\u221a \u2211 q\u0304i qi ,\nNc i=1\n\n(3)\n\n\fFIGURE 3. A planar diagram contributing to a meson three-point vertex at leading order.\n\nwhere i is the color index of the quark. The Nc -dependence of meson amplitudes can be\nobtained by studying quark-gluon diagrams. The leading diagrams are planar diagrams\nwith a single quark loop (L = 1) with all insertions of meson operators on the quark\nloop. An 3-meson diagram is shown in Fig. 3 as an example. The leading diagrams for\n\u221a\n1\u2212n/2\n). For example, a meson\ndecay constant is O( Nc );\nan n-meson amplitude are O(Nc\n\u221a\na meson mass is O(1); a 3-meson coupling is O(1/ Nc ), and so forth. This power\ncounting implies that large-Nc mesons are narrow states which are weakly coupled to\none another [8, 9].\nThe situation for baryons is qualitatively different. A large-Nc baryon is a bound state\nof Nc valence quarks completely antisymmetrized in the color indices of the quarks,\n\u03b5i1i2 i3 ***iNc qi1 qi2 qi3 * * * qiNc .\n\n(4)\n\nThe mass of the baryon is O(Nc), whereas the size of the baryon is O(1). The Nc dependence of baryon-meson scattering amplitudes and couplings can be determined\nby studying the Nc -counting of quark-gluon diagrams. An antibaryon-baryon\u2013n-meson\n1\u2212n/2\n), as is an amplitude for the scattering baryon+meson \u2192 baryon +\nvertex is O(Nc\n(n \u2212 1) mesons.\nNaively, this power counting is inconsistent. The amplitude for baryon + meson \u2192\nbaryon\n\u221a + meson scattering is O(1), whereas an antibaryon-baryon\u2013meson vertex is\nO( Nc ), and grows with Nc . A tree diagram with two different single-meson\u2013baryon\nvertices produces an amplitude which is O(Nc ), not O(1). Unless the O(Nc ) contributions of different tree diagrams all cancel one another exactly, the total scattering\namplitude is O(Nc ) and will violate the 1/Nc power counting. Imposing the constraint\nthat the scattering ampitude be O(1) results in relations amongst single-meson\u2013baryonantibaryon vertices which must be satisfied for consistency of the 1/Nc power counting for baryon-meson scattering amplitudes. Consistency of 1/Nc power counting for\nbaryon-meson scattering amplitudes and vertices results in non-trivial constraints on\nlarge-Nc baryon matrix elements at leading and subleading orders [1, 2]. Large-Nc consistency conditions also lead to the derivation of contracted spin-flavor symmetry for\nbaryons [1, 10].\n\n\fSPIN-FLAVOR SYMMETRY OF LARGE-NC BARYONS\nLarge-Nc contracted spin-flavor symmetry can be derived by considering pion-baryon\nscattering at low energies E \u223c O(1). In this kinematic regime, the large-Nc baryon\nacts as a heavy static source for scattering the pion with no recoil. There are two\ntree diagrams which contribute to the scattering amplitude at O(Nc ), the direct and\ncrossed diagrams. Using the Nc -independent baryon propagator of Heavy Baryon Chiral\nPerturbation Theory [11], it is easy to show that cancellation of the O(Nc ) scattering\namplitude from these two diagrams is given by the large-Nc consistency condition [1]\ni\nh\n(5)\nNc X ia , X jb \u2264 O(1) ,\nwhere the baryon axial vector couplings (in the baryon rest frame) are defined by\nAia \u2261 gNc X ia .\n\n(6)\n\nExpanding the operator X ia in a power series in 1/Nc ,\nX ia = X0ia +\n\n1\n1 ia\nX1 + 2 X2ia + . . . ,\nNc\nNc\n\nand substituting into Eq.

As we\nwill see, the matrix elements of X0ia between different baryon states are all determined\nrelative to one another by this constraint, so the O(Nc ) portion of the baryon axial vector\ncouplings Aia are all related by symmetry up to an overall normalization constant given\nby the coupling g, which is the reduced matrix element of the axial vector couplings.\nThe operator X0ia is an irreducible tensor operator transforming according to the spin1, SU (3) adjoint representation of spin \u2297 flavor, so the commutators of X0ia with the\nbaryon spin and flavor generators are given by\nh\ni\nh\ni\nja\nJ i , X0 = i\u03b5i jk X0ka ,\nT a , X0ib = i f abc X0ic .\n(9)\nThe Lie algebra of the baryon spin \u2297 flavor generators, together with Eqs.

It differs from the contracted spin-flavor algebra by the\ninclusion of some subleading 1/Nc terms in the generators Gia .\nThe contracted spin-flavor algebra in the large-Nc limit leads to baryon spin-flavor\nrepresentations which are infinite-dimensional. For finite Nc , it is convenient to work\nwith the SU (6) spin-flavor algebra which leads to finite-dimensional baryon representations. Since the emphasis of these lectures is on QCD baryons with Nc = 3, the spinflavor symmetry will be implemented for finite Nc . Discussion of the connection between finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional baryon representations can be found\nin Ref. [6].\nThe lowest-lying large-Nc baryon representation of the spin-flavor algebra is given\nby the completely symmetric tensor product of Nc quarks in the fundamental rep of\nspin-flavor. Under the breakdown of spin-flavor symmetry to its spin \u2297 flavor subgroup,\nthe completely symmetric spin-flavor representation decomposes into the spin and flavor representations displayed in Fig. 4. The baryon spin-flavor representation contains\nbaryons with spins J = 12 , 32 , 52 , * * * , N2c . The SU (3) flavor representation of the baryons\nwith a given spin J is given by the same Young tableau as its spin SU (2) representation.\nThe dimensions of the spin representations do not vary with Nc , but the dimensions of\nthe flavor representations do. Consequently, the SU (3) flavor multiplets are considerably more complicated for Nc > 3 than they are in QCD. The (T 3 , T 8 ) weight diagrams\nfor the spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 flavor multiplets for large-Nc baryons are given in Figs. 5\nand 6. The numbers appearing in the weight diagrams denote the degeneracy of each\nweight. While there are many additional baryon states for Nc > 3, for Nc = 3 these flavor representations reduce to the usual octet and decuplet multiplets, respectively.

Each baryon operator has a 1/Nc expansion in terms of all independent\noperator products which can be constructed from the baryon spin-flavor generators.\nThe general form of the baryon 1/Nc expansion is given by\nm\nOQCD\n= Ncm\n\nNc\n\n1\n\n\u2211 cn N n O n ,\n\nn=0\n\n(13)\n\nc\n\nm\nwhere OQCD\nis an m-body quark operator in QCD which acts on baryon states. The\nbaryon matrix elements of an m-body QCD quark operator can be at most O(Ncm ),\n\n\fwhich is reflected in the factor of Ncm in front of the 1/Nc operator expansion. The\n1/Nc expansion sums over all independent operators which transform according to the\nsame representation of spin \u2297 flavor symmetry as the QCD operator. The independent\noperators O n which form a basis for the 1/Nc expansion are nth degree polynomials\nof the baryon spin-flavor generators J i , T a and Gia . The baryon matrix elements of\nthese operator products can be computed in terms of the matrix elements of the baryon\nspin-flavor generators. The order in 1/Nc at which each independent operator product\nappears in the 1/Nc expansion also is known. 1/Nc power counting implies that an nbody operator product is multiplied by an explicit factor of 1/Ncn , or that each spin-flavor\ngenerator in an operator product is accompanied by a factor of 1/Nc . Since the matrix\nelements of an n-body operator product are \u2264 O(Ncn ), the matrix elements of each term\nin the 1/Nc operator expansion are manifestly \u2264 O(Ncm ), as required. Every operator\nin the operator basis is accompanied by an unknown coefficient cn , which is a reduced\nmatrix element of the spin-flavor 1/Nc expansion and is not predicted by spin-flavor\nsymmetry. The coefficients are O(1) at leading order in the 1/Nc expansion. Finally,\nthe summation over spin-flavor operators On only extends to Nc -body quark operators,\nsince all n-body quark operators with n > Nc will be redundant operators on baryons\ncomposed of Nc valence quarks.\nEach operator O n in the operator basis of the 1/Nc expansion can be written as an\nn-body quark operator using bosonic quarks which carry only spin and flavor quantum\nnumbers. Let q\u03b1 represent an annihilation operator for a bosonic quark with spin-flavor\n\u03b1 = 1, * * *, 6, and let q\u2020\u03b1 represent the corresponding creation operator. In terms of these\ncreation/annihilation operators, all n-body quark operators acting on baryon states can be\ncatalogued. There is only a single 0-body quark operator, the baryon identity operator\n11, which does not act on any of the valence quarks in the baryon. The 1-body quark\noperators are given by q\u2020 q and the baryon spin-flavor generators\n\u0013\n\u0012 i\ni\n\u2020 \u03c3\n\u2297 11 q ,\nJ = q\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bba\na\n\u2020\nq,\n(14)\nT = q 11 \u2297\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012 i\n\u03bba\nia\n\u2020 \u03c3\nq.\n\u2297\nG = q\n2\n2\nThe notation here is compact. Each 1-body quark operator is understood to act on each\nquark line in the baryon. Thus,\n\u0012 i\n\u0013\n\u03bba\n\u2020 \u03c3\nia\nG = \u2211 ql\nql .\n(15)\n\u2297\n2\n2\nl\nIn addition, note that q\u2020 q = Nc 11 is not an independent operator and can be eliminated\nfrom the list of 1-body quark operators. The 2-body quark operators are given by\nproducts of the 1-body quark operators, the baryon spin-flavor generators. Each 2-body\noperator product can be written as the symmetric product (or anticommutator) of two\n1-body operators since the commutator of any two 1-body operators can be replaced by\n\n\fTABLE 1.

This observation\nalso applies to all n-body operators with n \u2265 2.\nNot all operator products of the spin-flavor generators are linearly dependent, so it\nis necessary to eliminate redundant operators using operator identities. The complete\nset of 2-body operator identities for the completely symmetric baryon representation of\nSU (6) are given in Table 1 along with their respective spin \u2297 flavor representations [25].\nIt is possible to eliminate all redundant n-body operators by using the 2-body operator\nidentities, so Table 1 gives the complete set of operator identities.\nThe group theory behind Table 1 is interesting. Purely n-body quark operators are\nnormal-ordered operators of the form\n***\u03b1n \u03b21\nq\u2020\u03b11 . . . q\u2020\u03b1n T\u03b2\u03b111***\u03b2\nq . . . q\u03b2n .\nn\n\n(16)\n\nFor the completely symmetric SU (6) representation of baryon states, the only nonvanishing normal-ordered quarks operators have tensors T which are totally symmetric in\nthe upper and the lower spin-flavor indices. We would like to reexpress these independent normal-ordered operators as operator products of the spin-flavor generators, whose\nbaryon matrix elements are known.\nThe group theory behind the operator identities is particularly elegant. The 0-body\nquark operator 11 is in the singlet representation of SU (6), whereas the 1-body operators\ntransform as the tensor product of a fundamental and antifundamental of SU (6), which\ndecomposes into a singlet and an adjoint of SU (6). The 2-body operators are obtained\nfrom the tensor product of the symmetric 2-quark representation and its conjugate.\nSpecifically,\n0 \u2212 body : 1\n\u0010\n1 \u2212 body :\n\n\u2297\n\n\u0011\n\n= 1 + adj = 1 + T\u03b2\u03b1\n\n(17)\n\n\f2 \u2212 body :\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2297\n\n\u0011\n\n(\u03b1 \u03b1 )\n\n= 1 + T\u03b2\u03b1 + T(\u03b2 1\u03b2 2) .\n1 2\n\nThere are identities which relate the singlet and adjoint 2-body operators to 1-body\nadjoint and 0-body singlet operators, so the 2-body operators which transform as the\nsinglet and the adjoint are not independent. The relevant identities are most easily\nunderstood keeping SU (6) symmetry manifest. The generators J i , T a and Gia form a\ncomplete set of SU (6) generators \u039bA , A = 1, * * * , 35. The operator identities relating the\nsinglet 2-body operators to the 0-body operator and the adjoint 2-body operators to the\n1-body operators are given by the Casimir identities\n\u039bA \u039bA = C(R) 11\nd ABC \u039bB \u039bC = D(R) \u039bA ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere C(R) and D(R) are the quadratic and cubic Casimirs for the SU (6) baryon representation R. These Casimir identities for the completely symmetric baryon spin-flavor\nrepresentation produce the operator identities in the first two blocks of Table 1. The remaining 2-body operator identities arise because the completely symmetric product of\ntwo SU (6) adjoints,\n[\u03b1 \u03b12 ]\n(\u03b1 \u03b1 )\n+ T(\u03b2 1\u03b2 2)\n1 2]\n1 2\n\n(adj \u2297 adj)S = 1 + T\u03b2\u03b1 + T[\u03b2 1\u03b2\n\n,\n\n(19)\n\ncontains an additional tensor structure. The 2-body operator products corresponding\n[\u03b1 \u03b1 ]\nto the tensor T[\u03b2 1\u03b2 2] will vanish identically when acting on the completely symmetric\n1 2\nbaryon spin-flavor representation. These operator product combinations yield the vanishing operator identities given in the third part of Table 1.\nThe above operator identities are summarized by the following operator reduction\nrule: All operators in which two flavor indices are contracted using \u03b4ab , d abc , or f abc or\ntwo spin indices on G's are contracted using \u03b4i j or \u03b5i jk can be eliminated.\n\nQCD BARYONS\nI will now derive 1/Nc expansions for the masses, axial vector currents and magnetic\nmoments of baryons in QCD. SU (3) flavor breaking cannot be neglected relative to\n1/Nc, and is included in the analysis. For large-Nc baryons, the 1/Nc expansion extends\nup to Nc -body operators, so the 1/Nc expansion for QCD baryons goes up to third order\nin the generators. The 1/Nc expansion including flavor symmetry breaking also goes up\nto Nc -body operators, so perturbative SU (3) breaking extends to finite order in flavor\nsymmetry breaking. For a baryon operator with a 1/Nc expansion beginning with a nbody operator, the flavor symmetry breaking expansion extends to order (Nc \u2212 n).\n\nMasses\nThe baryon mass operator is a J = 0 operator. The leading operator in the 1/Nc expansion is the flavor singlet operator Nc 11 which gives the same O(Nc) mass to all baryons\n\n\fin a spin-flavor representation. Since the 1/Nc expansion begins with a 0-body operator,\nthe baryon mass operator can be expanded to third order in flavor symmetry breaking.\nThus, the baryon mass operator decomposes into the SU (3) flavor representations\nM = M 1 + M 8 + M 27 + M 64 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the singlet, octet, 27 and 64 are zeroth, first, second and third order in SU (3)\nflavor symmetry breaking, respectively. Each of these spin-singlet flavor representations\nhas a 1/Nc operator expansion. The 1/Nc expansions are given by\n1 2\nJ ,\nNc\n1 \b i i8\n1 \b\nM8 = T 8 +\nJ , G + 2 J 2, T 8 ,\nNc\nNc\n\b\n\b\n\b\n1\n1\nM 27 =\nT 8 , T 8 + 2 T 8 , J i , Gi8 ,\nNc\nNc\n1 \b \b\n,\nM 64 = 2 T 8 , T 8 , T 8\nNc\nM 1 = Nc 11 +\n\n(21)\n\nwhere it is to be understood that there is an unknown coefficient multiplying each\noperator in the above 1/Nc expansions. Note that the operators in these expansions\ncan be derived using the operator identities in Table 1. For example, consider the octet\nmass expansion. SU (3) flavor breaking transforms as the eighth component of an octet.\nThere is only one 1-body operator which is J = 0 and the eighth component of an\nSU (3) octet, namely T 8 . From Table\b1, one finds that\b there are three\n\b 2-body operators\nwhich transform in this manner: d ab8 Gia , Gib , d ab8 T a , T b and J i , Gi8 . However,\nTable 1 shows that one linear combination of these operators is proportional to the\n1-body operator T 8 , and that another linear combination vanishes for the completely\nsymmetric SU (6) baryon representation. Thus,\n\b there is only one independent 2-body\noperator. This 2-body operator is taken to be J i , Gi8 by the operator reduction rule.\nApplication of the 2-body identities implies that there is a single independent 3-body\noperator which transforms as a spin singlet and as the eighth component\nof a flavor octet.\n\b\nWithout loss of generality, this operator can be taken to be J 2 , T 8 . Similar analyses\nproduce the other expansions in Eq. (21).\nThe 1/Nc expansion of the baryon mass operator given by Eqs. (20) and (21) contains eight independent operators, which is equal to the number of baryon masses in the\n56 of SU (6): the N, \u039b, \u03a3, \u039e, \u2206, \u03a3\u2217 , \u039e\u2217 , \u03a9. Each mass operator contributes to a unique\nlinear combination of these eight masses. These linear combinations are given in Table 2[26]. Each mass combination occurs at specific orders in the 1/Nc and SU (3) flavor\nbreaking expansions; these suppression factors also appear in Table 2. The parameter\n\u03b5 \u223c ms /\u039bQCD is the suppression factor for SU (3) flavor symmetry breaking. The final\ncolumn gives the experimental value for the accuracy of each mass combination, which\nis defined by the dimensionless quantity\n\u2211 Bi\n\u2211 |Bi |/2\n\n(22)\n\n\fTABLE 2.

The numerical accuracies of the mass combinations are plotted in Fig. 7, except\nfor the mass combination corresponding to the Nc 11 operator. The hierarchy predicted\nby the 1/Nc suppression factors is clearly evident. For example, there are three mass\ncombinations that are first order in SU (3) breaking, but of order 1/Nc , 1/Nc2 and 1/Nc3\nrelative to the leading O(Nc ) singlet mass of the baryons. This pattern can be seen in\nFig. 7. In addition, the two flavor 27 mass combinations which are second order in SU (3)\nbreaking are suppressed by factors of 1/Nc2 and 1/Nc3 relative to the leading O(Nc )\nbaryon mass. The Gell-Mann\u2013Okubo flavor-27 mass splitting of the spin-1/2 baryon\noctet,\n1\n(2N \u2212 \u03a3 \u2212 3\u039b + 2\u039e) ,\n(23)\n4\nand the flavor-27 Equal Spacing Rule mass splitting of the spin-3/2 baryon decuplet,\n1\n(4\u2206 \u2212 5\u03a3\u2217 \u2212 2\u039e\u2217 + 3\u03a9) ,\n7\n\n(24)\n\nare linear combinations of the two flavor-27 mass splittings specified by the 1/Nc\nexpansion, so each is predicted to be a factor of 1/Nc2 more accurate than expected\nfrom flavor symmetry breaking factors alone. The most suppressed mass splitting is the\nflavor-64 Equal Spacing Rule mass splitting,\n1\n(\u2206 \u2212 3\u03a3\u2217 + 3\u039e\u2217 \u2212 \u03a9) ,\n4\n\n(25)\n\nwhich is third order in SU (3) flavor breaking and of relative order 1/Nc3 . This mass\ncombination is clearly suppressed by a greater factor than predicted from SU (3) breaking alone. The experimental accuracy of this mass combination is consistent with the\n1/Nc hierarchy, but a better measurement of the splitting in needed to test the 1/Nc3\nprediction of the 1/Nc expansion definitively.\n\n\f1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFIGURE 7.

The measured\nmass splitting is more accurate than the prediction based on flavor suppression fac-\n\n\ftors alone, and is consistent with an additional 1/Nc2 suppression predicted by the 1/Nc\nexpansion[26]. It is particularly noteworthy that this prediction of the 1/Nc expansion\nwas made before the Coleman-Glashow mass splitting was measured to the precision\nrequired to test the 1/Nc hierarchy. A more in-depth discussion of the I = 1 baryon mass\nsplittings can be found in Refs. [45] and [46].\n\nAxial Vector Couplings\nThe baryon axial vector current operator Aia is J = 1 and an SU (3) flavor adjoint.\nIn the SU (3) symmetry limit, the 1/Nc expansion of the baryon axial vector current is\ngiven by[25]\nAia =\n\n1\n1 \b \b\na1 Gia + b2 J i T a + b3 2 J i , J j , G ja\nN\nNc\n\u0012 c\n\u0013\n\b\n1 \b i \b j ja\n1\n2\nia\nJ ,G \u2212\nJ , J ,G\n,\n+d3 2\nNc\n2\n\n(27)\n\nwhere the 1/Nc expansion for QCD baryons extends up to 3-body operators. The 1/Nc\nexpansion involves four independent operators, so the baryon axial vector couplings are\ndetermined in terms of the four unknown coefficients a1 , b2 , b3 and d3 . The usual SU (3)\nflavor analysis of the axial vector couplings of the spin-1/2 baryon octet and spin-3/2\ndecuplet is given in terms of the four SU (3) couplings D, F, C and H,\n\b\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0001\n2D Tr B\u0304S\u03bc A\u03bc , B + 2F Tr B\u0304S\u03bc A\u03bc , B +C T\u0304 \u03bc A\u03bc B + B\u0304A\u03bc T \u03bc + 2H T\u0304 \u03bc S\u03bd A\u03bd T\u03bc , (28)\nwhere B represents the baryon octet, T \u03bc denotes the baryon decuplet, S\u03bc is a spin\noperator, and A \u03bc is the axial vector current of the pion octet. The coefficients of the\n1/Nc parametrization and the SU (3) couplings are related by\n1\n1\nD = a1 + b3 ,\n2\n6\n1\n1\n1\nF = a1 + b2 + b3 ,\n3\n6\n9\n1\nC = \u2212a1 \u2212 d3 ,\n2\n3\n3\n5\nH = \u2212 a1 \u2212 b2 \u2212 b3 .\n2\n2\n2\n\n(29)\n\nThe 1/Nc expansion for the baryon axial vector current can be truncated after the first\ntwo operators in Eq. (27) since the two 3-body operators are both suppressed relative to\nthe 1-body operator by a factor of 1/Nc2 . The 2-body operator J i T a can not be neglected\nrelative to the 1-body operator Gia for all a = 1, * * * , 8, so the leading order result for Aia\nis given by\n1\n(30)\nAia = a1 Gia + b2 J i T a ,\nNc\n\n\fin terms of two parameters a1 and b2 . The operator Gia alone produces axial vector\ncouplings with SU (6) symmetry. If only the Gia operator is retained, the four SU (3)\ncouplings satisfy\nF/D = 2/3,\n\nC = \u22122D,\n\nH = \u22123F .\n\n(31)\n\nThe operator J i T a breaks the SU (6) symmetry. The breaking is such that the SU (3)\ncouplings are related by\nC = \u22122D,\n\nH = 3D \u2212 9F ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhich reduces to SU (6) symmetry when F/D = 2/3.\nIt is worthwhile to consider the isospin decomposition of Aia into the isovector,\nisodoublet and isosinglet axial vector currents. The 1/Nc expansion for the isovector\naxial vector current is given by\nAia = a1 Gia + b2\n\n1 i a\nJI ,\nNc\n\na = 1, 2, 3 .\n\n(33)\n\nThe 2-body operator J i I a is suppressed relative to Gia for a = 1, 2, 3, since the matrix\nelements of Gia are O(Nc ) whereas the matrix elements of J i and I a are both O(1). Thus,\nthe 1/Nc expansion for the isovector current can be truncated to the 1-body operator Gi3\nup to a correction of order 1/Nc2 relative to the leading O(Nc ) term. A fit to the pion\ncouplings yields F/D = 2/3 up to a correction of relative order 1/Nc2 . Similar reasoning\nfor the isodoublet axial vector current gives F/D = 2/3 up to a correction of relative\norder 1/Nc . The 2-body operator cannot be neglected relative to the 1-body operator Gia\nfor the isosinglet axial vector current with a = 8.\nThe 1/Nc operator expansion for the flavor-octet baryon axial vector current can be\ngeneralized to include SU (3) breaking. The SU (3)-symmetric expansion begins with\na 1-body operator, so the baryon axial vector currents need to be expanded to second\norder in SU (3) symmetry breaking. However, many of the baryon axial vector current\nobservables are not measured, so it is not necessary to construct the 1/Nc expansion to\nall orders in SU (3) breaking. Instead, the 1/Nc expansion will be considered to linear\norder in SU (3) breaking.\nThe expansion at linear order in SU (3) breaking involves additional spin-1 operators\nin different flavor representations,\nia\nia\nia\nia\n\u03b4Aia = Aia\n \u0304 .\n1 + A8S + A8A + A27 + A10+10\n\n(34)\n\nA valid truncation of the 1/Nc expansion to first order in SU (3) breaking was constructed\nin Ref.

Dropping the c5 operator (since it does not contribute to any of the\nmeasured axial couplings) and adding the d3 operator (to allow the SU (3) parameters D,\nF and C to have arbitrary values) results in the 7-parameter formula\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \b i \b j ja\n1 \b 2 ia\n1 i a\nia\nia\n(36)\nJ ,G \u2212\nJ , J ,G\nA =\na1 G + b2 J T + d3 2\nNc\nNc\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 i a\n1 \b ia\n1 \b a i\n1\nia\na\n+\u2206 c1 G + c2 J T + c3\nG , Ns + c4\nT , Js + \u221a \u03b4a8W i ,\nNc\nNc\nNc\n3\nwhere \u2206a = 1 for a = 4, 5, 6, 7 and is zero otherwise, and\nW i = (c4 \u2212 2c1 ) Jsi +\n\n1\n1\n(c3 \u2212 2c2 ) Ns J i \u2212 3 (c3 + c4 ) Ns Jsi .\nNc\nNc\n\n(37)\n\nA comparison of the 1/Nc expansion given in Eqs. (36) and (37) with the experimental\ndata was performed in Ref. [28]. The extracted parameters from the experimental fit are\ntabulated in Table 3 1 . As discussed in Ref. [28], c1 and c4 are anomalously small, and the\ncharacter of the fit is not affected in any essential way by neglecting these parameters\naltogether. The coefficients c2 and c3 are suppressed relative to a1 and b2 by a factor\nconsistent with a power of SU (3) breaking \u03b5. There is evidence for the 1/Nc suppression\nfactors predicted in the 1/Nc expansion in the relative magnitudes of coefficients: a1 and\nb2 are comparable, as are c2 and c3 , which is what is expected from the 1/Nc analysis.\nHowever, the fit of Ref. [28] is somewhat unsatisfying in that the \u03c72 per d.o.f. is large,\nwhich was attributed to probable inconsistency in the experimental data.\nA plot in Fig. 8 of the deviations of the baryon axial vector couplings from an SU (3)symmetric fit is revealing. The SU (3) breaking of the baryon octet axial vector couplings\n1\n\nThe parameters used in Eqs. (36) and (37) differ from those in Ref. [28] because 1/Nc factors have\nnot been absorbed into the coefficients and because there is an overall factor of 2 difference in the\nabove formula for the axial vector currents compared to the definition in Ref. [28]. The parameters given\ncorrespond to Fit A of Ref. [28].\n\n\fFIGURE 8. Deviation of the axial couplings from the best SU(3)-symmetric fit. The open circles are\nthe experimental data, and the filled circles are the values from Fit A discussed in Ref. [28]. The points\nplotted are (from left to right) \u2206 \u2192 N, \u03a3\u2217 \u2192 \u039b, \u03a3\u2217 \u2192 \u03a3, \u039e\u2217 \u2192 \u039e, n \u2192 p, \u03a3 \u2192 \u039b, \u039b \u2192 p, \u03a3 \u2192 n, \u039e \u2192 \u039b,\nand \u039e \u2192 \u03a3.\n\nobtained from hyperon \u03b2-decay measurements is very small, as is well-known. The 1/Nc\nexpansion in Eq. (36) predicts the axial vector couplings of the 56 spin-flavor multiplet\nall together, which means that the SU (3) breaking of hyperon semileptonic decay is\nrelated by spin-flavor symmetry to the SU (3) breaking of nonleptonic decay decuplet\n\u2192 octet + pion. Thus, the pion axial vector couplings between the decuplet and octet\nbaryons are included with the hyperon \u03b2-decay gA s in the fit to SU (3) breaking of\nthe baryon axial vector couplings. Fig. 8 reveals that SU (3) breaking is much larger\nfor the decuplet-octet axial couplings than for the octet-octet couplings, and that an\nexcellent fit is obtained with the exception of the hyperon \u03b2 decays \u039e \u2192 \u039b, and \u039e \u2192 \u03a3.\n\n\fThe experimental uncertainty of these two measurements is sizeable, and there are\ndiscrepancies between different experimental measurements for these couplings. Thus,\nit is likely that the experimental data for these decays is not entirely trustworthy, and\nmay account for the large \u03c72 per d.o.f. of the fit. Fig. 8 shows that the 1/Nc fit favors\nsmaller SU (3) breaking for these couplings.\nThe first six experimentally measured baryon axial vector couplings in Fig. 8 are\nisovector couplings, which suggests an analysis using SU (2) \u00d7U (1)Y flavor symmetry\nrather than SU (3) flavor symmetry. The 1/Nc expansion for baryon isovector axial vector\ncouplings using SU (2) \u00d7U (1)Y flavor symmetry is given by\n1 \b\nNs , Gia\nNc\n1 \b\n1 \b\n1 \b \b\n+ 2 Ns , Ns , Gia + 2 J 2 , Gia + 2 I 2 , Gia\nNc\nNc\nNc\nn\nn\noo\n1\n1\n1\n+ J i I a + Jsi I a + 2 J i , Gka , Jsk\nNc\nNc\nNc\nn\nn\noo\n1 \b\n1 \b\n1\n+ 2 Ns , J i I a + 2 Ns , Jsi I a\n+ 2 Jsi , Gka , Jsk\nNc\nNc\nNc\n\nAia = Gia +\n\n(38)\n\nwhere a = 1, 2, 3 is an isovector index, and it is to be understood that each operator\nis multiplied by an unknown coefficient. The matrix elements of Gia for baryons with\nstrangeness of order unity are O(Nc ), whereas the matrix elements of J i , I a, and Jsi are\nO(1), so a valid truncation of the 1/Nc expansion is given by\nAia = a1 Gia + a2\n\n1 \b\nNs , Gia\nNc\n\n(39)\n\nup to terms which are suppressed by 1/Nc2 relative to the leading operator Gia . Eq. (39)\nyields the equal spacing rule for baryon axial couplings derived in Ref. [12]. The rule\nimplies an equal spacing of the decuplet \u2192 octet baryon non-leptonic pion couplings\nwhich is linear in strangeness,\ng(\u03a3\u2217 \u2192 \u03a3\u03c0) \u2212 g(\u2206 \u2192 N\u03c0) = g(\u039e\u2217 \u2192 \u039e\u03c0) \u2212 g(\u03a3\u2217 \u2192 \u03a3\u03c0)\ng(\u03a3\u2217 \u2192 \u03a3\u03c0) = g(\u03a3\u2217 \u2192 \u039b\u03c0).\n\n(40)\n\nThis equal spacing rule is clearly evident in the experimental data, as shown in Fig. 8.\nEq. (39) also implies SU (4) spin-flavor symmetry for the baryon isovector axial vector\ncouplings in each strangeness sector, so \u03b2-decay couplings n \u2192 p and \u03a3 \u2192 \u039b are related\nto the decuplet \u2192 octet pion couplings with strangeness zero and \u22121, respectively. These\nrelations are very well-satisfied.\n\nMagnetic Moments\n\u221a\nThe magnetic moment operator is J = 1 and transforms as the Q = T 3 + T 8 / 3\ncomponent of an SU (3) flavor 8. The 1/Nc expansion of the magnetic moment operator\n\n\fis the same as for the axial vector couplings with\n1\nM i = M i3 + \u221a M i8 .\n3\n\n(41)\n\nThe isovector magnetic moments are O(Nc) whereas the isoscalar magnetic moments\nare O(1) at leading order in the 1/Nc expansion, so it makes sense to construct 1/Nc\nexpansions for the isovector and isoscalar magnetic moments separately[16]. The 1/Nc\nexpansion of the isovector magnetic moments is given by\nM i3 = Gi3 +\n\n1 \b\nNs , Gi3 ,\nNc\n\n(42)\n\nup to terms which are suppressed by 1/Nc2 relative to leading 1-body operator Gi3 . The\n1/Nc expansion of the isoscalar magnetic moments is given by\nM i8 = J i + Jsi +\n\n1 \b\n1 \b\nNs , J i +\nNs , Jsi ,\nNc\nNc\n\n(43)\n\nup to terms of order 1/Nc2 compared to the two leading order 1-body operators J i and\nJsi . It is to be understood that every operator in Eqs. (42) and (43) is multiplied by an\nunknown coefficient of order unity.\nThere are 21 independent magnetic moments of the baryon octet and decuplet, including transition magnetic moments. These 21 magnetic moments consist of 11 isovector\ncombinations and 10 isoscalar combinations. The 1/Nc hierarchy of combinations of\nisovector and isoscalar magnetic moments is given in Table 4.\nThe 11 isovector magnetic moment combinations are parametrized in terms of the two\noperators of Eq. (42), so there are nine isovector magnetic moment relations which are\nsatisfied to order 1/Nc . These relations are listed as V 1 \u2212 9 in Table 4. Only one combination is measured, and the experimental accuracy 10 \u00b1 2% is consistent with the 1/Nc2\nprediction of the 1/Nc expansion. The 1/Nc expansion of the isovector magnetic moments can be truncated to the single operator Gia by eliminating the subleading operator\n\b\nNs , Gi3 operator. The isovector magnetic moment combination corresponding to this\nsubleading operator is O(1) in the 1/Nc expansion, or of relative order 1/Nc compared to\nthe leading O(Nc) contribution, and is listed as V 101 is Table 4. The experimental accuracy of this relation is 27 \u00b1 1%, which is consistent with the prediction 1/Nc of the 1/Nc\nhierarchy. It is possible to derive a slightly different version of this mass\b combination by\nconsidering an SU (3) analysis. In this analysis, the 2-body operator is T 8 , Gi3 , which\nis first order in SU (3) breaking and order 1/Nc compared to the leading operator. The\nmagnetic moment combination corresponding to this SU (3) operator is listed as V 102 .\nThe experimental accuracy of this relation is 13 \u00b1 2%, which is completely consistent\nwith the theoretic prediction of \u03b5/Nc of the 1/Nc expansion.\nThe 10 isoscalar magnetic moment combinations are parametrized by two 1-body\noperators at leading order in the 1/Nc expansion, so there are eight isoscalar magnetic\nmoment relations, which appear as S1 \u2212 8 in Table 4. The 1/Nc expansion of Eq. (43)\ncontains four operators, so there are six isoscalar combinations S1 \u2212 6 which are order\n1/Nc2 . The two subleading 2-body operators correspond to isoscalar relations S7 and S8,\n\n\fTABLE 4. Baryon Magnetic Moments in the 1/Nc expansion.

In addition, S8 is first order in SU (3) breaking. The experimental\naccuracies of the isoscalar magnetic moment combinations are in complete accord with\nthe 1/Nc hierarchy.\nFinally, there are two additional relations given in Table 4. S/V1 is a relation normalizing the isovector magnetic moments to the isoscalar magnetic moments in the SU (3)\nflavor symmetry limit, and the last relation predicting the \u2206++ magnetic moment is a\nlinear combination of V 2 and S2.\nAn alternative approach to the magnetic moments is possible using the 1/Nc expansion with SU (3) flavor symmetry breaking. The same formula derived for the baryon\naxial vector currents applies since the magnetic moments also transform as J = 1 and\nas a component of an SU (3) octet in the flavor symmetry limit. The analysis of flavor\nsymmetry breaking involves the same representations analyzed for the baryon axial vec-\n\n\fTABLE 5.

(36) can be applied to the magnetic moments. A fit to the baryon\nmagnetic moments using Eq. (36) gives the parameters listed in Table 5 taken from\nRef. [28]2 . For the magnetic moments, the extracted value of b2 is small, which implies\nthat F/D is very close to the SU (6) symmetry prediction of 2/3. A plot of the deviations of the baryon magnetic moments from an SU (3)-symmetric fit, given in Fig. 9,\nshows that SU (3) breaking is considerably larger for the magnetic moments than for\nthe baryon axial vector couplings. Furthermore,\nSU (3) symmetry breaking for the mag\u221a\nnetic moments is dominated by an O(Nc ms ) chiral loop correction, as shown in Fig 10\nwhere the deviation of the baryon magnetic moments from an SU (3)-symmetric fit together with the leading chiral loop correction is plotted. Clearly, the remaining SU (3)\nbreaking in the magnetic moments is much reduced when the leading non-analytic correction is included in the fit. This result also can be seen in Table 5 in terms of the small\nvalues of the extracted parameters \u03b4c2\u22124 which measure the deviation of the extracted\nSU (3) breaking parameters c2\u22124 from the flavor symmetry breaking structure given by\nthe dominant chiral loop graph. There is no analogue of this chiral non-analytic correction for the baryon axial vector currents, so the SU (3) breaking patterns of the baryon\nmagnetic moments and the baryon axial vector currents are not similar.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe 1/Nc expansion for QCD baryons is both useful and predictive. In the formal largeNc limit, there is a spin-flavor symmetry for baryons. For finite Nc , the spin and flavor\nstructure of the baryon 1/Nc expansion is prescribed at each order in 1/Nc . The 1/Nc\nexpansion is given in terms of operator products of the generators of the baryon spinflavor algebra which transform in a certain manner under spin \u2297 flavor symmetry. The\norder in 1/Nc of each operator structure is determined in the 1/Nc expansion, so the\n2\n\nAgain, the parameters used in Eqs. (36) and (37) differ from those in Ref. [28] because 1/Nc factors\nhave not been absorbed into the coefficients and because there is an overall factor of 2 difference in the\nabove formula for the axial vector currents compared to the definition in Ref. [28]. The parameters given\ncorrespond to Fit A of Ref. [28].\n\n\fFIGURE 9. Deviation of the magnetic moments from the best SU(3)-symmetric fit. The open circles\nare the experimental data, and the filled circles are the values from Fit A discussed in the text. The order\nof the magnetic moments is p, n, \u039b, \u03a3+ , \u03a3\u2212 , \u03a30 \u039b, \u039e0 , \u039e\u2212 , p\u2206+ , and \u03a9. The \u2206++ magnetic moment has\nnot been plotted, since the experimental value has a very large error.\n\n1/Nc expansion predicts a hierarchy of spin and flavor relations for baryons in 1/Nc .\nThe predicted hierarchy of the 1/Nc expansion is evident in the baryon masses, axial\nvector currents and magnetic moments. The pattern of spin-flavor symmetry breaking is\nquite intricate since 1/Nc and SU (3) flavor symmetry breaking are comparable in QCD.\nThe presence of 1/Nc suppression factors explains why SU (3) flavor symmetry works\nto a greater accuracy for baryons than predicted from an analysis of SU (3) breaking\nalone, and gives a quantitative understanding of spin-flavor symmetry breaking for QCD\nbaryons.\n\n\fFIGURE 10.
