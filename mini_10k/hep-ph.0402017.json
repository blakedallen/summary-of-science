Actually, the available experimental data already imply that\nthe ordinary MSSM is fine tuned at least by one part in 10. Clearly, the fine\ntuning of the MSSM is abnormally acute. Let us review the reasons for this\n(undesirable) situation1 . (For related work see refs. 2,3,4,5,6,7 )\nIn the MSSM the Higgs sector consists of two SU (2)L doublets, H1 , H2 .\n0\n, of these\nThe (tree-level) scalar potential for the neutral components, H1,2\ndoublets reads\n1\nV MSSM = m21 |H10 |2 +m22 |H20 |2 \u2212(m23 H10 H20 +h.c.)+ (g 2 +gY2 )(|H10 |2 \u2212|H20 |2 )2 ,\n8\n(1)\nwith m21,2 = \u03bc2 + m2H1,2 and m23 = B\u03bc, where m2Hi and B are soft masses and\n\u03bc is the Higgs mass term in the superpotential, W \u2283 \u03bcH1 * H2 . Minimization\nof V MSSM leads to a vacuum expectation value (VEV) v 2 \u2261 2(hH10 i2 + hH20 i2 )\nand thus to a mass for the Z 0 gauge boson, MZ2 = 14 (g 2 + gY2 )v 2 .\nThe parameters of eq.(1), in particular m2i , depend on the initial parameters, p\u03b1 , which for the MSSM are the soft masses, the \u03bc\u2212parameter, etc. at\n\nDurhamhep: submitted to World Scientific on October 31, 2018\n\n1\n\n\fthe initial (high energy) scale. Therefore, v 2 = v 2 (p1 , p2 , * * * ). The fine tuning\nassociated to p\u03b1 is usually defined by \u2206p\u03b1 as 2\n\u03b4v 2\n\u03b4p\u03b1\n= \u2206p\u03b1\n,\n2\nv\np\u03b1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b4v 2 is the change induced in v 2 by a change \u03b4p\u03b1 in p\u03b1 . Absence of fine\ntuning requires that \u2206p\u03b1 should not be larger than O(10).a\nAlong the breaking direction in the H10 , H20 space, the potential (1) can\nbe written in a SM-like form:\n1\n1\n(3)\nV = m2 v 2 + \u03bbv 4 ,\n2\n4\nwhere \u03bb and m2 are functions of the p\u03b1 parameters and tan \u03b2 (\u2261 hH20 i/hH10 i),\nin particular\nm2 = c2\u03b2 m21 (p\u03b1 ) + s2\u03b2 m22 (p\u03b1 ) \u2212 s2\u03b2 m23 (p\u03b1 ) .\n\n(4)\n\nMinimization of (3) leads to\n\u2212m2\n.\n(5)\n\u03bb\nIn the SM, m2 is an input parameter that receives important radiative\ncorrections, in particular the quadratically-divergent ones mentioned above:\n2\n\u03b4m2 \u221d 16\u03c0\u039b2 v2 (m2t + * * * ). Hence, a tuning between the tree-level and the oneloop contributions is required to keep m2 of electroweak size, and this sets the\nnaturalness bound on \u039b.\nIn the MSSM this type of corrections are absent. However, m2 receives\n2\nMX\nm\u03032\nimportant logaritmic corrections \u03b4m2 \u221d 16\u03c0\n2 log m\u03032 , where m\u0303 is a typical soft\nmass and MX represents the higher scale at which the soft breaking terms are\ngenerated. These corrections can be viewed as the effect of the RG running of\nm2 from MX down to the electroweak scale. Typically, the large logarithms\nand the numerical factors compensate the one-loop factor, so that the corrections are quite large, O(m\u03032 ) [actually the tree-level values of m2i , and thus\nof m2 , partly have a SUSY-breaking origin and are expected to be O(m\u03032 ) as\nwell]. This is a first reason why the naturalness bounds on the supersymmetric masses are more stringent than suggested by the SM argument based on\nthe SM quadratically-divergent corrections b . To be concrete, for large tan \u03b2\nv2 =\n\na Roughly\n\nspeaking \u2206\u22121\np\u03b1 measures the probability of a cancellation among terms of a given\nsize to obtain a result which is \u2206p\u03b1 times smaller. For discussions see 3,4,5,6 .\nb Notice, on the other hand, that the large radiative corrections are usually considered an\nappealing feature of the MSSM, since they trigger the electroweak breaking in quite an\nelegant way, due to the negative contribution to m22 .\n\nDurhamhep: submitted to World Scientific on October 31, 2018\n\n2\n\n\fand MX = MGUT ,\nm2 = m21 c2\u03b2 + m22 s2\u03b2 \u2212 m23 s2\u03b2 \u2243 1.01\u03bc2 \u2212 2.31m\u03032 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere, for simplicity, we have taken m\u0303 as the universal value of gaugino and\nscalar soft masses and trilinear soft terms, M = m = A = m\u0303. The presence\nof a sizeable RG coefficient in front of m\u03032 shows that the one-loop factor has\nbeen largely compensated.\nA second (and even more important) reason for the unusual fine tuning of\nthe MSSM is the following. From eq.(5), we note that \u2206 \u223c m2i /(\u03bbv 2 ), where\nm2i are the (potentially large) individual contributions to m2 [see eq.(6)]. Now,\nfor the MSSM \u03bb turns out to be quite small:\n\u03bbMSSM =\n\n1 2\n1\n(g + gY2 ) cos2 2\u03b2 \u2243\ncos2 2\u03b2 ,\n8\n15\n\n(7)\n\n> 15 times larger than expected from naive diwhich implies a fine tuning \u223c\nmensional considerations.\nThe previous \u03bbMSSM was evaluated at tree-level but radiative corrections\nmake \u03bb larger, thus reducing the fine tuning3,4 . Since m2h \u223c 2\u03bbv 2 , the ratio\n\u03bbtree /\u03bb1\u2212loop is basically the ratio (m2h )tree /(m2h )1\u2212loop , so for large tan \u03b2 the\nprevious factor 15 is reduced by a factor MZ2 /m2h . It is important to notice\nthat, although for a given size of the soft terms the radiative corrections reduce\nthe fine tuning, the requirement of sizeable radiative corrections implies itself\nlarge soft terms, which in turn worsens the fine tuning. More precisely, for the\n2\nMSSM \u03b4rad \u03bb \u221d log(MSUSY\n/m2t ), where MSUSY is an average of stop masses\n2\n[in the universal case, MSUSY \u2243 3.6m\u03032 +m2t +(D \u2212 terms)]. Hence, \u03bb can only\n2\nbe radiatively enhanced by increasing MSUSY\n, and thus m\u0303 and the individual\n2\n2\nmi . A given increase in MSUSY reflects linearly in m\u03032 and only logarithmically\nin \u03bb, so the fine tuning \u2206 \u223c m2i /(\u03bbv 2 ) gets usually worse.\nOn the other hand, for the MSSM sizeable radiative corrections to the\nHiggs mass (and thus to \u03bb) are in fact mandatory. This can be easily understood by writing the tree-level and the dominant 1-loop correction to the\ntheoretical upper bound on mh in the MSSM:\n\nm2h \u2264 MZ2 cos2 2\u03b2 +\n\nM2\n3m4t\nlog SUSY\n+ ...\n2\n2\n2\u03c0 v\nm2t\n\n(8)\n\nwhere mt is the (running) top mass (\u2243 167 GeV for Mt = 174 GeV). Since\nthe experimental lower bound, (mh )exp \u2265 115 GeV, exceeds the tree-level\ncontribution, the radiative corrections must be responsible for the difference,\nand this translates into a lower bound on MSUSY :\nMSUSY\n\n>\n\u223c\n\n2\n\ne\u22122.1 cos\n\n2\u03b2 (mh /62 GeV)2\n\ne\n\nmt\n\n>\n\u223c\n\n3.8 mt ,\n\nDurhamhep: submitted to World Scientific on October 31, 2018\n\n(9)\n\n3\n\n\f10\n\u2206 \u03bc2 =100\n\n\u2206 \u03bc2 =10\n\n\u2206 \u03bc2 =500\n\n9\n\nG\n135\n\nm h=\n\n8\n\n6\n2\n=1\nmh\n\ntan \u03b2\n\neV\n\n7\n\neV\n\n100\nm h=\n\n4\n\n5G\n\n5\n\nm\n\nGeV\n\n3\n\nh\n\n=1\n\n15\n\nGe\n\n\u2206 \u03bc2 =1000\n\nV\n\n2\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n~ (GeV)\nm\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\n2000\n\nFigure 1.

The\nproblem is worsened by the fact that sizeable radiative corrections (and thus\nsizeable soft terms) are needed to satisfy the experimental bound on mh . This\nis also due to the smallness of \u03bbtree : if it were bigger, radiative corrections\nwould not be necessary. In consequence, the most efficient way of reducing the\nfine tuning is to consider supersymmetric models where \u03bbtree is larger than in\nthe MSSM.

The first way corresponds to increasing \u03bb. The second, for a given mh , corresponds to reducing\nthe size of the soft terms [from (6) EW breaking requires the size of \u03bc2 to\nbe proportional to the overall size of the soft squared-masses], which is only\nallowed if radiative contributions are not essential to raise mh . Both improvements indeed concur for larger \u03bbtree .\nThe possibility of having tree-level quartic Higgs couplings larger than in\nthe MSSM is natural in scenarios in which the breaking of SUSY occurs at a\nlow-scale (not far from the TeV scale) 8,9,10,11 .d Besides, in that framework\nthe RG effects are largely suppressed due to the low SUSY breaking scale. As\nnoticed above, this is also welcome for the fine tuning issue. These ideas are\ndeveloped in detail in the next sections.\n3\n\nLow-scale SUSY breaking\n\n\u2718\u2718 ), there are two scales involved:\nIn any realistic breaking\nSUSY\n\u221a of SUSY (\u2718\n\u2718\n\u2718 scale, say F , which corresponds to the VEVs of the relevant\nthe \u2718\nSUSY\n\u2718\u2718 sector; and the messenger scale, M , associated\nauxiliary fields in the \u2718\nSUSY\nto the interactions that transmit the breaking to the observable sector. These\noperators give rise to soft terms (such as scalar soft masses), but also hard\nterms (such as quartic scalar couplings):\nm2soft \u223c\n\nF2\n,\nM2\n\n\u2718 \u223c\n\u03bb\u2718\nSUSY\n\nF2\nm2soft\n\u223c\n.\nM4\nM2\n\n(12)\n\n\u221a\nPhenomenology requires msoft = O(1 TeV), but this does\u221anot fix the scales F\nand M separately. So, (unlike in the MSSM) the scales F and M could well\nbe of similar order (thus not far from the TeV scale). This happens in the so\u2718\u2718 scenarios8,9,10,11 . In this framework, the hard terms\ncalled low-scale \u2718\nSUSY\nd This can also happen in models with extra dimensions opening up not far from the electroweak scale 12 . Another way of increasing \u03bbtree is to extend the gauge sector 13 or to\nenlarge the Higgs sector 14 . The latter option has been studied in 15 (for the NMSSM)\nbut this framework is less effective in our opinion.\n\nDurhamhep: submitted to World Scientific on October 31, 2018\n\n5\n\n\f\u3008F \u3009\nT\n\nH\n\nH\nF\n\nH\n\nT\n\nH\n\u3008F \u3009\nT\n\nH\n\n\u3008F \u3009\nT\n\n\u3008F \u3009\nT\n\nH\n\nFigure 2.

As discussed in the previous section, this is exactly the optimal\nsituation to ameliorate the fine tuning problem.\nAs a simple example, suppose that the K\u00e4hler potential contains the operator K \u2283 \u2212 M12 |T |2 |H|2 + * * * , where H denotes any Higgs superfield\n\u2718\u2718 , hFT i 6= 0. Then, the above\nand T is the superfield responsible for \u2718\nSUSY\nnonrenormalizable interaction produces soft terms as well as hard terms,\nwhich is schematically represented in the diagrams of Fig. 2.

(If the T field is heavy\nenough, it can be integrated out and one ends up with a truly 2HDM.)\nThe appearance of non-conventional quartic couplings has a deep impact\non the pattern of EW breaking 11 . In the MSSM, the existence of D-flat\ndirections, |H1 | = |H2 |, imposes the well-known condition, m21 + m22 \u2212 2|m23 | >\n0, in order to avoid a potential unbounded from below along such directions.\nHowever, the boundedness of the potential can now be simply ensured by\nthe contribution of the extra quartic couplings, and this opens up many new\npossibilities for EW breaking. For example, the universal case m21 = m22 is\nnow allowed, as well as the possibility of having both m21 and m22 negative\n(with m23 playing a minor role). In addition, and unlike in the MSSM, there\nis no need of radiative corrections to destabilize the origin, and EW breaking\ngenerically occurs already at tree-level (which is just fine since the effects of\nthe RG running are small as the cut-off scale is M ). Moreover, this tree-level\nbreaking (which is welcome for the fine tuning issue, as discussed in sect. 2)\noccurs naturally only in the Higgs sector 11 , as desired.\nFinally, the fact that quartic couplings are very different from those of the\n\nDurhamhep: submitted to World Scientific on October 31, 2018\n\n6\n\n\fMSSM changes dramatically the Higgs spectrum and properties. In particular,\nthe MSSM upper bound on the mass of the lightest Higgs field no longer\napplies, which has also an important and positive impact on the fine tuning\nproblem, as is clear from the discussion after eq. (11).\n4\n\nA concrete model\n\nIn this section we evaluate numerically the fine tuning involved in the EW\n\u2718\u2718 and compare\nsymmetry breaking in a particular model with low-scale \u2718\nSUSY\nit with that of the MSSM. We choose a model first introduced (as \"example\nA\") in 11 and analyzed there for its own sake.

In this way\nwe can study the effect on the fine tuning of varying \u03bb when the low energy\nmass scales (\u03bc and m\u0303) are kept fixed. When m\u0303/M is small (and this implies\nthat \u03bc/M is also small), the unconventional corrections to quartic couplings\nare not very important and the Higgs mass tends to its MSSM valuee . As\nm\u0303/M increases, the tree level Higgs mass (or \u03bb) also grows and this makes\n\u2206\u03bc2 decrease with mh , just the opposite of the MSSM behaviour.\nChanging the parameters of this model we find many other interesting\nregions, which correspond to wide ranges of tan \u03b2 and the Higgs masses (for\nmore details see ref.1 ). Actually, the pattern of Higgs masses can be very\ndifferent from the MSSM and restricting the fine tuning to be less than 10\ndoes not impose an upper bound on the Higgs masses, in contrast with the\nMSSM case. As a result, the LEP bounds do not imply a large fine tuning.\nOn the other hand, thanks to the size of the quartic couplings, the Higgs mass\ncan be as large as several hundred GeV if desired, but this is not necessary.\n< 500 GeV, so that\nIn any case, for \u2206\u03bc2 \u2264 10 we do find an upper bound m\u0303 \u223c\nLHC would either find superpartners or revive an (LHC) fine tuning problem\nfor these scenarios (although the problem would be much softer than in the\nMSSM).\ne For\n\nthe model at hand this limit is not realistic, as it implies too small (or even negative)\nvalues of m2A , m2H and m2H \u00b1 . However, we are interested in the opposite limit, of sizeable\nm\u0303/M .\n\nDurhamhep: submitted to World Scientific on October 31, 2018\n\n8\n\n\f16\n\n15\n\n\u2206\u03bc2\n\n14\n\n13\n\n12\n\n11\n115\n\n120\n\n125\n\n130\n\n135\n\n140\n\n145\n\n150\n\n155\n\nm h (GeV)\n\nFigure 3. Fine tuning in a low-scale SUSY breaking scenario as a function of the Higgs\nmass (in GeV) for tan \u03b2 = 10.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nThe fine tuning of the MSSM associated to the process of electroweak breaking\nis much more acute than suggested by general and intuitive arguments.\nThis is due, first, to the logaritmic corrections to the Higgs mass parameter, m2 , which are unusually large because large logarithms and numerical\nfactors compensate the one-loop suppression; and, second (and even more important), due to the small magnitude of the tree-level Higgs quartic coupling\n1\n\u03bbMSSM = 18 (g 2 +gY2 ) cos2 2\u03b2 \u2243 15\ncos2 2\u03b2. This makes the \"natural\" value for\n2\n2\nthe Higgs VEV, v \u223c msoft /\u03bb much larger than m2soft . Moreover, the smallness\nof \u03bbtree implies a tree-level Higgs mass smaller than the experimental lower\nbound. Hence, large radiative corrections to mh (and thus large soft terms)\nare required, which makes the fine tuning problem especially discomforting.\nAs a consequence, the most efficient way of reducing the fine tuning is\nto consider supersymmetric models where \u03bbtree is larger than in the MSSM.\nThis occurs naturally in scenarios in which the breaking of SUSY occurs at\na low scale (not far from the TeV scale). As an extra bonus the radiative\ncorrections to m2 are small (EW breaking takes place at tree-level), which\nalso helps in reducing the fine tuning.\nWe illustrate this in an explicit model, where we achieve a dramatic improvement of the fine tuning for any range of tan \u03b2 and the Higgs mass (which\ncan be as large as several hundred GeV if desired, but this is not necessary).\nThis work is supported in part by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Tech-\n\nDurhamhep: submitted to World Scientific on October 31, 2018\n\n9\n\n\fnology through a MCYT project (FPA2001-1806).
