The new generation of models makes heavy\nuse of the standard economics toolkit and analyzes a number of issues from a dynamic\nperspective or from the perspective of optimizing agents. Interestingly, however, spatial\nmodels adopting the perspective of dynamically optimizing consumers remain in relative\nminority, despite the fact that they are standard fare in mainstream economic research.\nThe models in [1], [2] and [3] are notable exceptions in this respect.\nThe present work develops a model that studies the behaviour of a dynamically optimizing economic agent who makes two types of interrelated choices: consumption-saving\ndecisions and spatial relocation (migration) decisions. Unlike the constructs in [1], [2] and\n[3], the consumer in our model has a finite lifetime and a bequest incentive at the end of\nhis life. This departure from classical Ramsey-type models enables richer global dynamics\nby allowing agents to inherit their ancestors' savings in a setup akin to that of overlapping\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nFaculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University, e-mail iordanov@fmi.uni-sofia.bg\nFaculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University, e-mail avassilev@fmi.uni-sofia.bg\n\n1\n\n\fgenerations models. It also offers the additional option of introducing heterogeneous agents\nwhose economy-wide behaviour can be obtained through an explicit aggregation rule.\nA second important difference with the above papers is that our consumer saves in\nnominal assets. This partly depends on our choice to center the model around the behaviour of (potentially different) individuals as opposed to that of a representative agent.\nMore importantly, however, the nominal savings feature reflects our belief that pecuniary\nconsiderations play an important role in the choice of where to work and how much to\nconsume.\nFormally, we cast the model in the form of a continuous-time optimal control problem\nwith a finite planning horizon. The assumptions of the model, while fairly standard in\neconomics, create several mathematical challenges in the present setup. First, they preclude\nthe direct application of the existence theorems for optimal control problems known to the\nauthors. This requires an alternative approach to proving the existence of solutions of the\nmodel. In particular, unlike traditional existence proofs in the spirit of Theorem 4, \u00a74.2 in\n[8], we prove an existence result that dispenses with convexity assumptions on the set of\ngeneralized speeds for the optimal control problem. Also, the functional forms employed\nin the model do not allow one to directly apply Pontryagin's maximum principle, since the\ntransversality condition for one of the state variables is not defined at the point 0. To be\nable to use the maximum principle, we prove that for an optimal control-trajectory pair\nthe terminal value of the particular state variable is strictly positive. Finally, economic\nconsiderations point to the fact that only a subset of the possible values for the other\nstate variable in the model are of real interest. One way to take care of that issue is to\nconstrain the values of this state variable to lie in a certain set \u2013 the interval [0, 1] in\nour case \u2013 for each point in time. However, instead of using an explicit state constraint,\nwhich would complicate the use of the maximum principle, we introduce an additional\ncorrecting mechanism by suitably defining the wage distribution function w(x) outside the\ninterval [0, 1]. We claim this mechanism does not influence the other characteristics of the\nmodel, while being sufficient to ensure that the optimal state variable never leaves the set\nin question, and we prove that indeed this is the case.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model and the\nassumptions we make. Section 3 proves the existence of a solution to the model under the\nabove assumptions. Section 4 applies Pontryagin's maximum principle to obtain necessary\nconditions for optimality. Section 5 describes some convenient transformations of the system of necessary conditions and comments on the existence of solutions to this system. The\nanalysis in section 6 characterizes the asymptotic behaviour of terminal assets for different\nsets of model parameters. This establishes facts that are useful for the study of relocation\nchoices in section 7. The results in this section are also of independent economic interest\nas they shed light on the impact of intra- and intertemporal preferences on the saving decisions of an individual with a sufficiently long planning horizon. Finally, section 7 tackles\nthe question of relocation behaviour in the basic case of a wage distribution having a single\nmaximum (single-peaked wage distribution). The results obtained for this case are intuitive, if unsurprising: in most cases a consumer with a sufficiently long lifespan relocates\n2\n\n\ftoward the wage maximum. While the single-peak case offers easily predictable results, we\nconsider it useful as a testing ground for the model before applying it to more interesting\nsituations. Indeed, preliminary results by the authors on the case of a double-peaked wage\ndistribution suggest that a host of complex situations, including multiple solutions and\nbifurcations, can arise.\nAcknowledgements. We would like to thank Tsvetomir Tsachev and Vladimir Veliov\nfor useful discussions and pointers to the literature. The responsibility for any errors is\nsolely ours.\n\n2\n\nThe model\n\nWe employ a continuous-time model that deals with the case of a consumer who, given\nan initial location in space x0 and asset level a0 , supplies inelastically a unit of labour in\nexchange for a location-dependent wage w(x(t)), and chooses consumption c(t) and spatial\nlocation x(t) over time. The consumer has a finite lifetime T at the end of which a bequest\nin the form of assets is left. This bequest provides utility to the consumer. More precisely,\nfor \u03c1, r, \u03b7, \u03be and p \u2013 positive constants, and \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1), we look at the optimal control\nproblem\n(2.1)\n\nmax\n\nc(t),z(t)\u2208\u2206\n\nJ(c(t), z(t)) :=\n\nZT\n0\n\n\u2212\u03c1t\n\ne\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nc(t)1\u2212\u03b8\na(T )1\u2212\u03b8\n2\n\u2212 \u03b7z (t) dt + e\u2212\u03c1T\n1\u2212\u03b8\n1\u2212\u03b8\n\nsubject to\n(2.2)\n\n\u0227(t) = ra(t) + w(x(t)) \u2212 pc(t) \u2212 \u03bez 2 (t),\n\n(2.3)\n\n\u1e8b(t) = z(t),\na(0) = a0 \u2265 0,\nx(0) = x0 \u2208 [0, 1],\n\nwhere a(t), x(t) are the state variables, assumed to be absolutely continuous, and c(t), z(t)\nare the control variables. The set of admissible controls \u2206 consists of all pairs of functions\n(c(t), z(t)) which are measurable in [0, T ] and satisfy the conditions\n(2.4)\n\n0 \u2264 c(t) \u2264 C,\n\n(2.5)\n\n|z(t)| \u2264 Z,\n\n(2.6)\n\na(T ) \u2265 0.\n3\n\n\fThe constants C and Z are such that\n(2.7)\n\n(2.8)\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\nC > max 1, \u03bc\nZ>\n\na0 + T maxx |w(x)|\n\u2212rT\np 1\u2212er\n\n!\n\n,\n\nT maxx |w \u2032(x)|erT\n,\n2\u03be\n\nwhere \u03bc := maxt,t0 \u2208[0,T ] e(r\u2212\u03c1)(t\u2212t0 ) > 0.\nRemark. The bounds we impose on the admissible controls through equations (2.4)\nand (2.5) are convenient from a technical viewpoint when proving the existence theorem\nin section 3. Conditions (2.7) and (2.8) ensure that these constraints are never binding.\nHowever, considerations of general nature \u2013 both economic and physical \u2013 make such\nconstraints appealing.\nIn the above model \u03c1 > 0 is a time discount parameter and \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1) is the utility\nfunction parameter. The control c(t) represents physical units of consumption and the\ncontrol z(t) governs the speed of relocation in space. We assume that relocation in space\nbrings about two type of consequences. First, relocation causes subjective disutility associated with the fact that there is habit formation with respect to the place one occupies.\nSecond, changing one's location is associated with monetary relocation costs that have to\nbe paid out of one's income or stock of assets. As a baseline case we choose to capture\nthese phenomena by means of the speed of movement in space \u1e8b(t) or, equivalently, z(t),\ntransformed through a quadratic function. The manner in which spatial relocation affects\nthe consumer's utility and wealth can vary widely, however, therefore other functional\nforms are certainly admissible. The parameters \u03b7, \u03be \u2265 0 multiplying this function measure\nthe subjective disutility from changing one's location in space and the relocation costs in\nmonetary terms, respectively. The parameters p > 0 and r > 0 stand for the price of a\nunit of consumption and the interest rate, respectively.\nThe nonnegativity condition is imposed on terminal assets a(T ) both to have a welldefined objective functional and to capture the intuitive observation that, with a known\nlifetime, a debtor is unlikely to be allowed to leave behind outstanding liabilities to creditors. The condition a(T ) \u2265 0 also sheds light on the nonnegativity restriction for a0 ,\nsince in an environment where no debts are allowed at the end of one's lifetime, no debtor\nposition can be inherited at birth.\nFor the purposes of our analysis we look at the basic case where economic space is\nrepresented by the real line. We are interested in only a subset of it, the interval [0, 1]. This\nis modelled by taking the initial location x0 \u2208 [0, 1] and requiring the location-dependent\nwage, which is positive in (0, 1), to be negative outside [0, 1] and to satisfy additional\nassumptions. Namely, we have w(x) > 0, x \u2208 (0, 1) and w(x) < 0, x 6\u2208 [0, 1], as well as\nw \u2032 (x) > 0, x \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0] and w \u2032 (x) < 0, x \u2208 [1, \u221e). Later in the paper we formally verify\nthe intuitive claim that an optimal trajectory for x(t) will never leave the interval [0, 1]\nunder the above conditions. We also assume that w(x) \u2208 C 2 (R1 ) and w(x) is bounded, i.e.\n4\n\n\fmaxx\u2208R |w(x)| < +\u221e. We impose additional requirements on w(x) to derive some of the\nresults in section 7.\n\n3\n\nExistence of solutions\n\nNext we investigate the issue of existence of a solution to the model. The proof requires\ntwo intermediate results, shown as lemmas below.\nLemma 3.1 Let the functions xi , i = 1, 2, . . . , and x\u0304 be defined on [0, T ] and take values\nin the interval [a, b]. Let xi tend uniformly to x\u0304 as i \u2192 \u221e (denoted by xi \u21d2 x\u0304) and\nw \u2208 C 0 [a, b]. Then, in [0, T ], as m \u2192 \u221e we have\ni)\n\n1\nm\n\nPm\n\ni=1\n\nxi \u21d2 x\u0304,\n\nii) w(xm ) \u21d2 w(x\u0304),\nP\niii) w( m1 m\ni=1 xi ) \u21d2 w(x\u0304).\nProof. The proof directly replicates the standard proofs of counterpart results on\nnumerical sequences. \u0004\nLemma 3.2 (The Banach-Saks Theorem) Let {vn }\u221e\nn=1 be a sequence of elements in a\nHilbert space H which are bounded in norm: kvn k \u2264 K = const, \u2200n \u2208 N. Then, there\nexist a subsequence {vnk }\u221e\nk=1 and an element v \u2208 H such that\nvn1 + * * * + vns\n\u2212 v \u2192 0 as s \u2192 \u221e.\ns\n\nProof. See, for example, [5, pp.78-81]. \u0004\nTheorem 3.3 Under the assumptions stated in section 2, there exists a solution (c(t), z(t)) \u2208\n\u2206 of problem (2.1)-(2.3).\nProof. We start by noting that the set of admissible controls \u2206 is nonempty. To see this,\nchoose controls c(t) \u2261 c0 = const and z(t) \u2261 0. Then, any c0 \u2208 (0, w(x0)/p] will ensure\nthat a(T ) \u2265 0.\nNext, observe that (c(t), z(t)) \u2208 \u2206 implies c(t), z(t) \u2208 L\u221e [0, T ] and\n(3.1)\n\n0 \u2264 a(T ) \u2264 const = erT (a0 + T max |w(x)|).\nx\u2208R\n\n5\n\n\f(We note that (2.6) implies the following bounds,\n\u0010\n\u0011\npkc(t)kL1 [0,T ] , \u03bekz(t)k2L2 [0,T ] \u2264 erT a0 + T max |w(x)| ,\nx\n\nwhich do not depend on the constants C and Z.)\n\nRT\nThrough an application of H\u00f6lder's inequality one verifies that 0 c(t)1\u2212\u03b8 e\u2212\u03c1t dt \u2264\nconst(T )kc(t)k1\u2212\u03b8\nL1 .\nThus, for (c(t), z(t)) \u2208 \u2206, the objective functional (2.1) is bounded. Consequently,\nJ0 := sup(c(t),z(t))\u2208\u2206 J(c(t), z(t)) < \u221e. Then we can choose a sequence of controls {(ck (t), zk (t))} \u2282\n\u2206 such that J(ck (t), zk (t)) \u2192 J0 .\nLet ak (t) and xk (t) be the state variables corresponding to the controls (ck (t), zk (t)).\nIt is easy to verify that the functions ak (t) and xk (t) form a uniformly bounded and\nequicontinuous set. Then, by the Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli theorem (see, e.g., [8], Ch.4), there exists\na subsequence (aks (t), xks (t)) \u21d2 (\u0101(t), x\u0304(t)).\nThen, if cks (t) and zks (t) are the controls corresponding to (aks (t), xks (t)), by Lemma\n3.2 we can in turn choose subsequences cksq (t) and zksq (t) whose arithmetic means tend in\nL2 [0, T ] norm to some elements in L2 [0, T ], denoted c\u0304(t) and z\u0304(t), respectively.

To apply the maximum principle, however,\nwe need to ensure that the terminal utility from assets e\u2212\u03c1T a(T )1\u2212\u03b8 /(1 \u2212 \u03b8) is well-behaved\nat least for the optimal value of terminal assets. To this end, we prove the following\nTheorem 4.1 For the optimal controls (c(t), z(t)) the terminal value of assets a(T ) is\nstrictly positive for any T > 0.\nProof. Let us assume that there is a time T0 > 0 for which a(T0 ) = 0.\nStep 1. We first verify that it is impossible to have c(t) \u2261 0. Assuming that c(t) \u2261 0,\ntogether with a(T0 ) = 0, yields the objective functional\nJ(0, z(t)) = \u2212\u03b7\n\nZT0\n\nz 2 (t)e\u2212\u03c1t dt \u2264 0.\n\n0\n\nIf one of the following two conditions is valid:\n1. a0 > 0 and x0 \u2208 [0, 1];\n2. a0 = 0 and x0 \u2208 (0, 1),\nthen we can choose the admissible pair z\u0304(t) \u2261 0 (so that x(t) \u2261 x0 ) and c\u0304(t) \u2261 c0 =\nconst > 0, where c0 is such that\nZT0\na0 + [w(x0 ) \u2212 pc0 ]e\u2212rt dt = 0.\n0\n\n8\n\n\fThe last condition is equivalent to\na0 + T0 w(x0 )\n\ne\u2212rT0 \u2212 1\ne\u2212rT0 \u2212 1\n= pc0\n\u2212r\n\u2212r\n\nand therefore c0 > 0. Then\nJ(c\u0304(t), z\u0304(t)) =\n\nZT0\n\nc1\u2212\u03b8\n0\ne\u2212\u03c1t dt > 0,\n1\u2212\u03b8\n\n0\n\ncontradicting the optimality of (c(t), z(t)).\nThe case a0 = 0 and x0 = 0 or 1 is pathological in the sense that the consumer has\nneither current income (w(0)=w(1)=0), nor initial wealth. Economically, it is implausible\nto expect that such a consumer will manage to obtain a loan. From a purely formal point\nof view, however, the consumer could get a loan and finance his relocation even in this\ncase. Moreover, he will be able to attain positive consumption levels.\nTo illustrate the above claim, suppose that x0 = 0, a0 = 0 and the consumer spends\nall the income left after paying the relocation costs. Fix \u03b50 > 0 in such a way that\nw \u2032 (x) \u2265 w \u2032 (0)/2 > 0 for x \u2208 [0, \u03b50 ]. Let the relocation strategy be given by the control\nz\u0304(t) = \u03b5 sin T\u03c0 t, \u03b5 > 0. Then consumption is given by c\u0304(t) = w(x\u0304(t)) \u2212 \u03be z\u0304 2 (t), where x\u0304(t) is\nx\u0304(t) = \u03b5\n\nZt\n0\n\nThen, x\u0304(T ) =\n\n2T \u03b5\n\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010\u03c0 \u0011\n\u03c0t\n2\u03b5T\n\u03b5T\n\u03c0t\n1 \u2212 cos\n=\n\u03c4 d\u03c4 =\nsin2\n.\nsin\nT\n\u03c0\nT\n\u03c0\n2T\n\n< \u03b50 for \u03b5 sufficiently small.

We know that for the optimal c(t) it is impossible to have c(t) \u2265 C0 or c(t) \u2261 0.\nConsequently, there exists t0 \u2208 [0, T ] for which c(t0 ) \u2208 (0, C0 ).

This is a consequence of Leray-Schauder index theory (see \u00a72.4 in [10]). Also, the\nsolution to (5.2) may not be unique, as can be seen from simple examples of eigenfunction\nproblems that possess nontrivial solutions.\nA solution to (5.1) or (5.2) can be viewed as a particular member of the family of\nsolutions (x(t, \u03b1), y(t, \u03b1)) to the Cauchy problem\n\n(5.4)\n\n\u1e8b(t) = Fy(t)\n,\n(t)\n\u2032\n\u1e8f(t) = \u2212w (x(t))\u03bb1 e\u2212rt ,\nx(0) = x0 ,\ny(0) = \u03b1,\n\nwhere \u03b1 has been chosen appropriately, so that\n(5.5)\n\ny(T, \u03b1) = 0.\n\nThe existence of a unique solution to (5.4) on the interval [0, T ] for initial data (x0 , \u03b1) and\neach T > 0 is ensured by Corollary 3.1, chapter 2, in [6].\nSince (5.5) is equivalent to \u1e8b(T, \u03b1) = 0, we can integrate the differential equation in\n(5.2) over [0, T ] to arrive at an equivalent form of (5.5):\n(5.6)\n\n\u03b1 = \u03bb1\n\nZT\n\nw \u2032 (x(\u03c4, \u03b1))e\u2212r\u03c4 d\u03c4.\n\n0\n\nIt is straightforward to verify the following\n17\n\n\fProposition 5.1 The function x(t) \u2261 x0 is a solution to (5.2) if and only if the point x0\nis a critical point for w(x), i.e. w \u2032 (x0 ) = 0.\nThe analysis of the solutions of the system of necessary conditions, which is carried out\nin section 7, provides the dynamics of the behaviour of the economic agent, implied by\nthis model, in the baseline case when the wage distribution has a single maximum point\non the interval [0, 1].

We assume for simplicity that x0 \u2208 (0, 1), i.e. w(x0 ) > 0, as well as that a0 > 0.\nAlso, in this section we denote by C different constants that do not depend on T .

We\ndemonstrate first the validity of the following general claim (under the conditions stated\nat the end of section 2):\nProposition 7.1 The optimal trajectory x(t) remains in the interval [0, 1], regardless of\nthe particular form of the wage distribution w(x) in [0, 1].\nProof. Notice that since \u1e8b(t) = p2 (t)/F (t), with F (t) defined as in section 5, in view of\n(4.15) we can write\n\u03bb1\n\u1e8b(t) =\nF (t)\n\nZT\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212r\u03c4\n\nw (x(\u03c4 ))e\n\nd\u03c4 = G(t)\n\nt\n\nZT\n\nw \u2032 (x(\u03c4 ))e\u2212r\u03c4 d\u03c4,\n\nt\n\nwhere G(t) := \u03bb1 /F (t).\nAssume first that at time t1 the point x(t) leaves the interval [0, 1] to the left (i.e. leaves\nthe interval at x = 0) and remains to the left of zero until t = T , so that x(t) < 0 for\nt \u2208 (t1 , T ]. Then, for t \u2208 [t1 , T ], w \u2032(x(t)) > 0 and consequently \u1e8b(t) > 0. This would\nimply that for some t\u2217 \u2208 (t1 , T ), x(T ) \u2212 x(t1 ) = (T \u2212 t1 )\u1e8b(t\u2217 ) > 0, or x(T ) > x(t1 ) = 0,\nwhich contradicts the assumption that x(t) < 0 for t \u2208 (t1 , T ]. Thus, x(t) cannot leave the\ninterval [0, 1] to the left and remain outside it until the end of the planning horizon T . A\nsimilar argument shows that it is impossible for x(t) to leave the interval [0, 1] to the right\nand stay there.\nLet us now assume that x(t) leaves the interval [0, 1] to the left of zero at time t1 and\nreturns back at time\nfor t \u2208 (t1 , t2 ) we have x(t) < 0 and w \u2032 (x(t)) > 0,\nR t2 t2 \u2032 > t1 . Again,\nwhich means that t1 w (x(t))e\u2212rt dt > 0. Since x(t) leaves the interval [0, 1] to the left at\nt1 , it must be that \u1e8b(t1 ) \u2264 0. By the same logic, at time t2 we should have \u1e8b(t2 ) \u2265 0.\nThen one obtains\n\u1e8b(t1 ) =G(t1 )\n\nZT\n\nw (x(t))e\n\nZt2\n\nw \u2032 (x(t))e\u2212rt dt +\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212rt\n\ndt = G(t1 )\n\nt1\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212rt\n\nw (x(t))e\n\nt1\n\nt1\n\n=G(t1 )\n\nZt2\n\nG(t1 )\nG(t2 )\ndt +\nG(t2 )\n\nZT\n\nw \u2032 (x(t))e\u2212rt dt\n\nt2\n\nG(t1 )\n\u1e8b(t2 ) > 0,\nG(t2 )\n\nwhich contradicts the condition \u1e8b(t1 ) \u2264 0. Hence it is impossible for x(t) to temporarily\nleave the interval [0, 1] to the left. Naturally, this argument can be applied with obvious\n21\n\n\fmodifications to the hypothesis that x(t) temporarily goes to the right of x = 1. Summarizing the above conclusions, we see that the optimal x(t) remains in the interval [0, 1].\n\u0004\nWe turn next to the main object of study for this section: the case when the wage\nfunction has a single peak on the interval [0, 1]. The example of the quadratic function\nw(x) = x(1 \u2212 x) in a neighbourhood of the interval [0, 1] may facilitate visualization.\nAssume that in this case the initial location x0 lies to the left of the wage peak, i.e.\nif x1 := argmaxx\u2208[0,1] w(x), then 0 \u2264 x0 < x1 . For the remainder of this section we\nwill assume that w \u2032 (x) > 0, x \u2208 [0, x1 ] and w \u2032(x) < 0, x \u2208 [x1 , 1]. In this case, for T\nsufficiently small, x(T ) will remain in a small neighbourhood of x0 . However, this means\nthat w \u2032(x(t)) > 0 for any t \u2208 [0, T ] and therefore \u1e572 (t) < 0, which implies p2 (t) > 0 since\np2 (T ) = 0. As p2 (t) > 0, we obtain \u1e8b(t) > 0. In words, for sufficiently small planning\nhorizons the consumer unambiguously relocates toward the wage maximum.\nIf x(T ) \u2208 (x0 , x1 ), we have, using the notation in section 5, \u1e8f(t) = \u2212w \u2032 (x(t))p1 (t) < 0.\nSince y(T ) = 0, it follows that y(t) > 0, t \u2208 [0, T ). Then \u1e8b(t) = Fy(t)\n> 0, so that x(t) is\n(t)\nmonotonically increasing.\nWe note that there does not exist a solution to the system of necessary conditions for\nwhich x(T ) = x1 . For such a solution we would have y(T ) = 0 and one could compare\nthis solution of the stationary solution x\u0303(t) \u2261 x1 , \u1ef9(t) \u2261 0. Then, the uniqueness of the\nsolution to a Cauchy problem (for identical data at t = T ) shows that the two solutions\ncoincide. This, however, is impossible, since for t = 0 the values of the two solutions are\ndifferent (x(0) = x0 6= x\u0303(0) = x1 ).\nWe would like to check whether it is possible for the terminal location x(T ) to lie to\nthe right of the wage peak for x0 < x1 . To this end, assume that x(T ) > x1 and let t1\nbe the time when point x1 is reached last, i.e. x(t1 ) = x1 and for t \u2208 (t1 , T ) we have\nx(t) > x1 . (In other words, t1 = sup{t \u2208 [0, T ]|x(t) = x1 }.) Then, by the mean value\ntheorem, 0 < x(T ) \u2212 x(t1 ) = (T \u2212 t1 ) Fy(t(t\u2217\u2217)) for some t\u2217 \u2208 (t1 , T ). However, since \u1e8f(t) > 0,\nt \u2208 (t1 , T ), and y(T ) = 0 imply y(t\u2217 ) < 0, we obtain Fy(t(t\u2217\u2217)) < 0, which is a contradiction.\nThus, x(T ) cannot lie to the right of x1 .\nThe systematic study of the relocation behaviour of the economic agent in this case\ncan be reduced to the analysis of the way in which the solutions to the Cauchy problem\n(5.4) behave for different values of the parameter \u03b1. Those solutions that satisfy (5.5)\nare also solutions to the system of necessary conditions (5.1), i.e. extremals. Through\nthis approach we can also obtain information on the number of solution to the problem at\nhand. Of course, if only one extremal exists, then it is the solution we seek.\nWe remind the reader that the number \u03bb1 = \u03bb1 (T ) is fixed, insofar as T is fixed.\nCase I: \u03b1 \u2264 0. It is obvious that for small t we have y(t) < 0 since \u1e8f(t) < 0. For such\nt we have\nZt\ny(\u03c4 )\nx(t) = x0 +\nd\u03c4 < x0 ,\nF (\u03c4 )\n0\n\n22\n\n\fi.e. Rthe agent shifts toward x = 0. It means that \u1e8f(t) remains negative, so that y(t) =\nt\n\u03b1+ 0 \u1e8f(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 also remains negative and x(t) keeps moving to the left. Thus, it is impossible\nfor (5.5) to become true, i.e. there are no extremals among the solutions of (5.4) for \u03b1 \u2264 0.\nCase II: \u03b1 > 0. In this case we have y(t) > 0 in a neighbourhood of t = 0 and so x(t)\nmoves to the right in the direction of the point x1 . However, \u1e8f(t) = \u2212w \u2032 (x(t))p1 (t) < 0,\nso that y(t) decreases. If it turns out that y(T ) = 0 and x(T ) < x1 , then the respective\nsolution is an extremal. The existence of such an extremal is guaranteed by Theorem 3.3.\nThe latter claim can be established through an alternative approach, which allows us to\nascertain the number of extremals.\nWe introduce the notation M(\u03b1) for the right-hand side of (5.6). Since x(t) < x1 for\nt \u2208 [0, T ], we get\n1 \u2212 e\u2212rT\nM(\u03b1) \u2264 \u03bb1 max |w \u2032(x)|\n=: M0 ,\nx\nr\ni.e. in view of (5.6) the relevant values of \u03b1 lie in the interval (0, M0 ).\nIt is easy to see that the function\ng(\u03b1) := \u03b1 \u2212 M(\u03b1)\nis continuous on the interval [0, M0 + 1] and satisfies the inequalities\ng(0) < 0 < g(M0 + 1).\nConsequently, there exists \u03b1 > 0 for which g(\u03b1) = 0, i.e. which satisfies (5.6).\nProposition 7.2 For the case of a single-peaked wage distribution w(x) with w \u2032\u2032 (x) \u2264 0\nin [0, 1], there exists a unique extremal for the system (5.1).\nProof. Assume that at least two different extremals exist. They solve the system (5.4)\nfor different positive values \u03b11 6= \u03b12 , for which \u03b1i \u2212 M(\u03b1i ) = 0, i = 1, 2.

Since X(T ) < x1 ,\n\u2200T > 0, we have l := supT >0 X(T ) \u2264 x1 .\nProposition 7.3 Under the assumptions of Proposition 7.2, we have the following classification. If \u03c1 \u2265 r or \u03c1 \u2208 (0, r(1 \u2212 \u03b8)], then l = x1 . If \u03c1 \u2208 (r(1 \u2212 \u03b8), r), it is possible to have\nl < x1 for appropriate values of the parameters of the problem.\nProof. Assume that l < x1 .
