In these false vacua, parity (and also CP) is\nspontaneously broken, a quality that could lead to experimental signatures\nlike parity odd correlations of the produced particles.\nIn the present work, we investigate the production of \u03b7 \u2032 -particles during the\ndecay of the CP-odd metastable states, concentrating on the amplification of\nthe low momentum modes by parametric resonance when the zero mode rolls\ndown from the false to the true vacuum. This mechanism plays an important\nrole for particle production in inflationary cosmology [4\u201311] and has also been\n1\n\nElectronic address: baier@physik.uni-bielefeld.de\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint\n\nReceived today\n\n\finvestigated for the formation of Disoriented Chiral Condensates [12\u201315] and\nfor Axions [16]. Here we discuss the efficiency of the amplification mechanism\nfor the production of \u03b7 from the decaying metastable bubble. As a main result we derive the corresponding momentum spectrum showing non-thermal\nbehaviour. The integrated density of particles produced is estimated to be\n0.7f m\u22123 .\n\n2\n\nMetastable states in hot hadronic matter\n\nThe idea is based on the effective Lagrangian of the Witten-DiVecchia-Veneziano\nmodel [17\u201319]\n\nLef f =\n\nf\u03c02 h\ntr(\u2202\u03bc U\u2202\u03bc U + ) + tr(MU + MU + )\n4\n\u0012\n\u00132 #\na\ni\n+\n\u2212\n\u03b8 \u2212 tr(ln U \u2212 ln U )\n, (1)\nNc\n2\n\nwhich describes the low-energy dynamics of the pseudoscalar mesons in the\nlarge Nc -limit of QCD. In the following, we consider the \"real world\"-vacuum\nangle \u03b8 \u2261 0. Formation and decay of a non-zero \u03b8-vacuum and its signatures\nare investigated in [20]. The Nf \u00d7 Nf -matrix U in Eq. (1) describes the meson\nfields, and the term containing the mass matrix M provides the explicit soft\nbreaking of chiral symmetry due to the quark masses. M can be written as\nMij = \u03bc2i \u03b4ij , where the diagonal elements are chosen as \u03bc21 \u2261 \u03bc22 \u2261 m2\u03c0 and\n\u03bc23 \u2261 2m2K \u2212 m2\u03c0 .

The\nparameter a = 2Nf \u03bbY M /f\u03c02 represents the topological susceptibility.\nFinite temperature is introduced into the model via the temperature dependence of the parameters: For T = 0, the value a = m2\u03b7 + m2\u03b7\u2032 \u2212 2m2K \u2243\n0.726 GeV 2 can be determined from experimental results [17\u201319], and \u03bc2 \u2261\n(\u03bc21 + \u03bc22 + \u03bc23 )/3 = (m2\u03c0 + 2m2K )/3 \u2243 0.171 GeV 2 . The corresponding value of\nthe pion decay constant is f\u03c0 \u2243 93 MeV .\n2\n\n\fWhen the temperature approaches the temperature Td of the phase transition,\na(T ) goes to zero, indicating the effective restoration of the UA (1)-symmetry\nfor T > Td with enhanced \u03b7 - and \u03b7 \u2032 - production as a possible signature\n[21,22]. We use the temperature of the deconfinement phase transition, Td ,\nfollowing the assumption of [1] that any other phase transition of this model\nalso occurs at Td . According to mean field estimates [1], a(T ) \u221d (Td \u2212 T ) and\n\u03bc2 (T ) \u221d (Td \u2212 T )\u22121/2 near the phase transition.\nIn order to get an analytically tractable approximation that allows some insight into the physical processes, we consider only the singlet, which is the\nmain component of the \u03b7 \u2032 -meson. Using Nc = 3, the effective Lagrangian\nsimplifies to\n\uf8ebs\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1\n2 \u03b71 \uf8f8 a 2\n3\nLs = (\u2202\u03bc \u03b71 )(\u2202 \u03bc \u03b71 ) + f\u03c02 \u03bc2 cos \uf8ed\n\u2212 \u03b71 .\n2\n2\n3 f\u03c0\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe singlet effective potential\nV\n\n\u03b7\nf\n\n!\n\nVs\n\u2261 2 2\nf \u03bc\n\n\u03b7\nf\n\n!\n\n= \u2212 cos\n\n\u03b7\na \u03b72\n+ 2 2,\nf\n2\u03bc f\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we have\nq dropped the index 1 in the notation of the singlet and introduced f \u2261 3/2f\u03c0 for convenience, can be considered as a projection of the\nfull effective potential. It takes three qualitatively different shapes, depending on the temperature, more specifically, on the value of a(T )/\u03bc2 (T ). For\nlarge values of a/\u03bc2 , corresponding to small T , the potential is a more or less\ndeformed parabola (see Fig. 1a). For a/\u03bc2 = 0, i.e. T > Td , the potential\nis periodic with minima at \u03b7/f = 0, 2\u03c0, 4\u03c0..., which are all equivalent true\nvacua (see Fig. 1d). And for a small, nonzero value of a/\u03bc2 , corresponding\nto a temperature just below the phase transition, metastable states appear\nin the potential which are distinct from the true vacuum (see Fig. 1c). One\nrecognizes that the false vacua are odd under parity transformation, but even\nunder charge conjugation, and therefore odd under CP [1].\nOne can show that the effective potential exhibits metastable states also in the\ncase of nonvanishing \u03c0\u2212, \u03b78 \u2212 and K\u2212fields, provided that m\u03c0 6= 0 [23]. But\nonly the singlet is responsible for the formation of these states, in the sense\nthat it is the only field which appears in the term of the effective potential\nwhich includes the topological susceptibility.\n\n3\n\nThe decay of the metastable states\n\n3\n\n\f3.1 Dynamics of the model\nApplying the model to the description of a heavy ion collision, we suppose that\nduring the phase transition, the potential changes its shape from the parabola\n(Fig. 1a), corresponding to the low temperature phase, to that of the high\ntemperature phase (Fig. 1d), and back to the low temperature phase, but\nthis time including metastable states that have been created at a temperature\njust below the phase transition. After the phase transition, but still at high\ntemperature, the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2212field may be trapped in a metastable state, forming a\n\"CP-odd bubble inside the hadronic phase\" in the language of [1]. Considering\nthe effective potential as a function of temperature, one recognizes that there\nexists a value a/\u03bc2 (Tsp ) for which the local minimum turns into a saddle point\n(see Fig. 1b). For the lowest false vacuum, this happens for a/\u03bc2 (Tsp ) = 0.217\nat the value (\u03b7/f )sp = 4.493. Assuming the proportionality a(T )/\u03bc2 (T ) \u221d\n(Td \u2212 T )3/2 to hold even far from Td , the temperature corresponding to this\nspecial case of the potential can be estimated to be Tsp \u2248 0.86 Td . Once\nthe saddle point temperature is reached and the barrier has disappeared, the\n\u03b7 \u2032 \u2212field starts rolling down into the true vacuum and oscillating around it,\nwhile energy is transferred from the mean value of the field into its quantum\nfluctuations. The resulting growth of the occupation numbers of the quantum\nfluctuations is interpreted as particle production with respect to the true, CP\neven, vacuum, whereas the zero mode is damped. This process is investigated\nin more detail in the following.\nA crucial assumption for this picture is that at least after the saddle point\ntemperature has been reached, the effective potential changes slowly compared\nto the motion of the field, so that the oscillations can be considered as taking\nplace in a static potential, frozen at T = Tsp . Accordingly, the ratio a/\u03bc2 =\n0.217 is kept fixed during the evolution in time, and the value of f as well.\nThe solutions we find (see below) show that the zero mode reaches the true\nvacuum for the first time after 1 \u2212 2 f m, whereas the relevant time scale to\nbe considered for the particle production is of the order of 10 f m.\n\n3.2 Evolution equations\nTo study the dynamics of the decay process, we decompose the field into its\nexpectation value \u03c6(t) \u2261 h\u03b7(~x, t)i and fluctuations \u03c7 about it,\n\u03b7(~x, t) = \u03c6(t) + \u03c7(~x, t)\n\n(5)\n\nwith h\u03c7(~x, t)i = 0, so that the \"physical\" fluctuations are given by the usual\nexpression h(\u03c7 \u2212 h\u03c7i)2 i = h\u03c72 i. With this decomposition, following the stan4\n\n\fdard method as described in, e.g., [5,6,8,11], we obtain two evolution equations\nfrom the effective Lagrangian (3). The effect of the quantum fluctuations at\nlowest order is taken into account with a Hartree-type approximation [5,8,11]\nthat consists of the factorization \u03c73 \u2192 3h\u03c72 i\u03c7 and \u03c72 \u2192 h\u03c72 i and the selfconsistency condition represented by Eq. (7) given below; terms of higher order\nin \u03c7 are neglected. Taking the expectation value hi, we arrive at the equation\nfor the zero mode\nd2 \u03c6(\u03c4 )\nh\u03c72 i\u03c4\n+\n1\n\u2212\nd\u03c4 2 f\n2f 2\n\n!\n\nsin\n\n\u03c6(\u03c4 )\na \u03c6(\u03c4 )\n+ 2\n= 0,\nf\n\u03bc f\n\n(6)\n\nwritten for the dimensionless mean field \u03c6/f , where the dimensionless time\nvariable \u03c4 \u2261 \u03bct is introduced. The expectation value of the fluctuations\nh\u03c72 i\u03c4 \u2261\n\nZ\n\nd3 k\n|\u03c7k (\u03c4 )|2\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(7)\n\nis calculated from the mode functions \u03c7k (\u03c4 ) which are known from the Fourier\nexpansion of the field. The integration is done over the interval of momenta\nfor which the quantum fluctuations are enhanced.\nWe use the definition (7) for the back reaction, although it does not fulfill\nh\u03c72 i0 = 0, because it reflects the background of the calculation, the closedtime-path technique which is usually applied for the description of out-ofequilibrium dynamics in field theory. In this framework, the fluctuations are\ndefined as the two-point correlation functions or equal-time Green's functions\n[5]\nh\u03c72 i\u03c4 \u221d\n\nZ\n\nd3 k\nGk (\u03c4, \u03c4 ).\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(8)\n\nThe mode functions satisfy the mode equation\nd2\n\u03c7\u03ba (\u03c4 ) + \u03c9\u03ba2 (\u03c4 )\u03c7\u03ba (\u03c4 ) = 0,\n2\nd\u03c4\nwritten for the dimensionless mode functions \u03c7\u03ba \u2261\n\u03c9\u03ba2 (\u03c4 )\n\nh\u03c72 i\u03c4\n=\u03ba + 1\u2212\n2f 2\n2\n\n5\n\n!\n\ncos\n\n\u221a\n\n(9)\n\n\u03bc\u03c7k , where\n\n\u03c6(\u03c4 )\na\n+ 2\nf\n\u03bc\n\n(10)\n\n\fis the time-dependent frequency squared with \u03ba \u2261 k/\u03bc. They are used for the\ncalculation of the particle production: The induced particle number density\nn(\u03c4 ) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 k\nnk (\u03c4 )\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n(11)\n\nis obtained from the spectral particle number density\n|\u03c7\u0307\u03ba (\u03c4 )|2\n\u03c9\u03ba\n2\n|\u03c7\u03ba (\u03c4 )| +\nn\u03ba (\u03c4 ) =\n2\n\u03c9\u03ba2\n\n!\n\n1\n\u2212 ,\n2\n\n(12)\n\nwhich can be calculated from the mode functions. Since the unstable solutions\nof the mode equations contribute to the resonant particle production, the\nintegration in (11) is carried out over the momenta corresponding to these\namplified solutions, as in Eq. (7). For practical purposes, we use \u03c9\u0304\u03ba2 \u2261 \u03ba2 +a/\u03bc2\nin definition (12), because it keeps the particle number positive definite for all\nvalues of \u03c4 and minimizes the fluctuations in the particle number. Accordingly,\n\u221a\nthe initial values\nof\nthe\nmode\nfunctions\nare\nchosen\nas\n\u03c7\n(0)\n=\n1/\n2\u03c9\u0304\u03ba and\n\u03ba\nq\n\u03c7\u0307\u03ba (0) = \u2212i \u03c9\u0304\u03ba /2 such that n\u03ba (0) = 0. However, the results depend only\nweakly on the choice of \u03c9\u03ba both in the initial conditions and in the definition\nof the particle number. The choice for the initial conditions of the zero mode is\nsuggested by the model: \u03c6 is \"released\" right below the saddle point \u03c6sp /f =\n4.493 with zero velocity, i.e. \u03c6\u0307(0) = 0. For the numerical results shown below,\nwe used the starting value \u03c6(0)/f = 4.2.\n\n3.3 Solutions and results\nConsidering the coupled system (6) and (9) with (10), one recognizes that the\nexpectation value transfers energy to the mode functions via a time dependent\nfrequency, and the mode functions in turn modify the equation of motion for\nthe zero mode. A natural first step in the solution of this system is to neglect\nthe fluctuation terms in both equations, obtaining the \"classical\" evolution\nequations with h\u03c72 i\u03c4 = 0 where the mode functions do not react back on the\nzero mode. If the variable frequency\n2\n\u03c9\u03ba,cl\n= \u03ba2 + cos\n\n\u03c6(\u03c4 )\na\n+ 2\nf\n\u03bc\n\n(13)\n\nin the mode equation depends periodically on time, according to Floquet's\ntheorem [24] it has quasiperiodic solutions of the form\n\u03c7cl\n\u03ba (\u03c4 ) = exp(\u03bc\u03ba \u03c4 )P (\u03c4 ),\n6\n\n(14)\n\n\fwhere the characteristic exponent \u03bc\u03ba depends on \u03c9\u03ba,cl , and P (\u03c4 ) is a periodic\nfunction of the same period as \u03c9\u03ba,cl, usually normalized to have unit amplitude.\nFor certain values of the parameter \u03c9\u03ba,cl, there exist so called resonance bands\nthat contain the exponentially growing (or resonant) solutions with a real\ncharacteristic exponent \u03bc\u03ba . These resonance bands are known, for example,\nfor the solutions of the Mathieu- or the Lam\u00e9-equation.\nAn analytic solution of the classical system can be found with a Sine-Gordonequation [7], which consists essentially of setting a/\u03bc2 \u2248 0 in our case. The\ncorresponding approximate zero mode equation is given by\n\u03c6\u0308cl (\u03c4 )\n\u03c6cl (\u03c4 )\n+ \u03c1 sin\n= 0,\nf\n\u03c1f\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c1 = 1.43 represents the radius of the potential and is needed to adjust\nit to the original potential. It has the solution\n\u03c6cl (\u03c4 )\n= 2\u03c1 arctan\nf\n\ns\n\n\u01eb\ncn(\u03c4, m)\n2\u2212\u01eb\n\n!\n\n(16)\n\nwith \u01eb \u2261 1 \u2212 cos(\u03c6(0)/\u03c1f ), and m = \u01eb/2 is the square of the modulus of the\nJacobian elliptic function cn. The resulting mode equation is a Lam\u00e9-equation\nwith the resonance band [7] 0 \u2264 \u03ba2 \u2264 \u01eb/2. The resulting \u03bc\u03ba is shown in Fig. 2\nin comparison with the result of the numerical calculation of \u03bc\u03ba for the solution\nof the classical mode equation. In the range of the single resonance band of\nthe Lam\u00e9-equation, 0 \u2264 \u03ba2 \u2264 0.97, the numerical calculation yields three\nresonance bands, and at least two for \u03ba2 > 1. (This structure reminds of the\nMathieu-equation which has more than one resonance band.) The maximum\nvalue \u03bc\u03ba,max \u2243 0.42 is found around \u03ba2 \u2248 0.1, and the maximum value for the\nSine-Gordon-solution, \u03bcsg\n\u03ba,max \u2243 0.5, yields an acceptable approximation .\nThe momentum spectrum of the produced particles reflects the structure of\nthe resonance bands. When the general expression for the mode functions (14)\nis inserted into Eq. (12), it is obvious that the particle production is essentially\ndetermined by \u03bc\u03ba :\nln n\u03ba (\u03c4 ) \u2212 ln\n\n\u03c9\u03ba (\u03c4 )\n\u2243 2\u03bc\u03ba \u03c4.\n2\n\n(17)\n\nIn the classical approximation discussed above, the back reaction of the fluctuations on the zero mode (and also on the fluctuations themselves) is ignored.\nThis implies that the approximation is not energy conserving, which can immediately be seen from the zero mode solution which is not damped although\nit is supposed to transfer its energy to the mode functions, which indeed grow\n7\n\n\fexponentially. Since the mode functions are not decoupled from the zero mode,\nat least the other direction of energy transfer is reflected by the approximation: The larger the initial value \u03c6(0), the more energy can be transferred,\nand the larger the mode functions and the particle number grow.\nThe evolution equations including the back reaction are solved numerically.\nFor the evaluation, we use f (Tsp ) \u2243 f (0) and \u03bc(Tsp ) \u2243 676 MeV . Because\nthe value of \u03bc in our approximation is only fixed by the value of Tsp , which\ndepends on our restriction to the singlet case and may not correspond to the\nreal physical situation, we also try \u03bc(T = 0) = 412 MeV as the other limit of\nthe range of possible values for \u03bc(T ).\nAlthough the inclusion of the back reaction destroys the parametric resonance,\nit does not suppress the particle production completely. The particle number\n(Fig. 3) reaches its asymptotic value for tend \u2248 10f m. At about the same time,\nthe value of the back reaction term h\u03c72 i\u03c4 /2f 2 grows larger than 1, indicating\nthat the approximations made become inappropriate for the description of the\ndynamics for larger times (cf. Eq. (6)). One recognizes from Fig. 3 that the\nchoice of \u03bc(T ) has some influence on tend ; the asymptotic number density of the\nproduced particles lies between 0.7f m\u22123 and 0.9f m\u22123 . The absolute number of\nparticles can be calculated from this density if the size of the CP-odd bubbles\nis known. For example, for a domain with radius 5 f m, as suggested in [25],\nwe estimate a yield of 90-100 particles from our model.\nA measure for the size of correlated domains of particles is the correlation\nlength \u03be, which can be calculated from the two-point correlation function\nD(x, \u03c4 ) \u221d\n\nZ\n\nd\u03ba \u03ba2\nj0 (\u03bax)|\u03c7\u03ba (\u03c4 )|2 ,\n2\n2\u03c0\n\n(18)\n\nwhere x = \u03bcr denotes the dimensionless length. For large x,\n!\n\n\u2212x2\nD(x, \u03c4 ) \u221d exp 2\n,\n\u03be (\u03c4 )\n\n(19)\n\nfrom which we estimate the correlation length for tend . As a lower limit for the\ndomain radius, we obtain \u03be \u2243 2.4 f m for \u03bc(T = 0) and \u03be \u2243 1.3 f m for \u03bc(Tsp ).\nThe momentum spectrum of the produced particles at tend \u2243 10 f m is shown\nin Fig. 4. Its maximum is located at about the value of \u03ba as the maximum of \u03bc\u03ba\nin Fig. 2, which had been calculated for the system without back reaction. The\nspectrum deviates significantly from a thermal Bose-Einstein distribution.\n8\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nR.B. thanks the E.
