We show that, including\nthe Lowest Order Parity Conserving (PC) contact terms, allows us to reproduce the total\n12\n2\ndecay rates for 5\u039b He, 11\n\u039b B and \u039b C with a reasonable value of \u03c7\u0302 , while in order to get\na prediction for the Parity Violating (PV) asymmetry compatible with experiments, we\nhave to include the Lowest Order PV contact pieces.\nIn analogy to the familiar NN phenomenology, the weak \u039bN interaction has traditionally been modeled using meson-exchange approaches. It is well known that the longrange part of the interaction is well explained by one-pion exchange (OPE), which can\napproximately reproduce the hypernuclear non mesonic decay rates-\u0393-but not the ratio\nbetween the partial rates, \u0393n /\u0393p = (\u039bn \u2192 nn)/(\u039bp \u2192 np). The large energy released in\nthe process (m\u039b \u2212 mN \u2248 177 MeV) suggests that short range contributions could well be\nimportant. Along this line, the literature shows us that the inclusion of the kaon (OKE)\nis particularly convenient, due to the specific interference between OPE and OKE in the\nPC and PV channels[1,2,3], which substantially enlarges the \u0393n /\u0393p ratio, while reducing\nthe total decay rate by a factor of 2. One way of accounting for short range contributions\non top of OKE, is to parametrize the physics contained in that region in terms of local\nfour-fermion interaction terms. This will be the approach followed here, and we will see\nthat, despite the significant degree of SU(3) symmetry breaking, we can get an stable chiral expansion for the \u039bN \u2192 NN process. Not considered here is the intermediate-range\n2\u03c0-exchange (two orders higher in the chiral expansion than the corresponding single\npion-exchange piece), nor the last member of the SU(3) Goldstone-boson octet, the \u03b7,\nsince the strong \u03b7NN coupling is an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding\n\u03c0NN and K\u039bN couplings[4].\nThe explicit forms for our OPE and OKE transition potentials can be found elsewhere[1,\n5]. Here, only the form of the 4-fermion contact potential, V4P (~r), is presented.

It is noticeable that including the LO PV terms,\nwhich are one order higher in the chiral expansion, does not substantially alter the previously fitted LO PC coefficients, thus supporting the validity of our expansion. Moreover,\nthey barely modify the total and partial rates but significantly affect the asymmetry,\nA, as one should expect for an observable defined by the interference between PV and\nPC amplitudes. Finally, we find coefficients of natural size with significant error bars,\nreflecting the level of experimental uncertainty.\nThe present study then supports the validity of the EFT framework for nonmesonic\nhypernuclear weak decay, and we hope to be able to much better constrain the parameters\nin such studies with the next generation of high-precision experimental data, currently\nunder analysis.\nREFERENCES\n1.
