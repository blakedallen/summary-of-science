We will look at\nthis Hamiltonian in the framework of Wigner quantization, a concept which has been triggered by\nWigner in [1], but was really introduced much later by Palev [2, 3, 4]. Since the Wigner perspective\nhas already been considered in detail by Lievens and Van der Jeugt in [5], we will only present their\nresults succinctly. For a more thorough deduction of the results, we refer to the aforementioned\npaper.\nWigner quantization dictates that the canonical commutation relations involving p\u0302j and q\u0302j\nshould be replaced by less restrictive compatibility conditions (CCs). These arise by imposing the\nequivalence of Hamilton's equations and the Heisenberg equations. For the n-dimensional Wigner\nharmonic oscillator, the CCs are given by\n[\u0124, q\u0302j ] = \u2212\n\ni~\np\u0302j ,\nm\n\n[\u0124, p\u0302j ] = i~m\u03c9j2 q\u0302j ,\n\nfor j = 1, . . . , n. By introducing new operators a\u00b1\nj by\na\u00b1\nj =\n\n...\n\nwe can rewrite the Hamiltonian as\n\u0124 =\n\ni\nm\u03c9j\nq\u0302j \u2213 p\np\u0302j\n2~\n2m~\u03c9j\n\n(2)\n\nn\n~X\n\u2212\n\u03c9j {a+\nj , aj }.\n2 j=1\n\nIn terms of these new operators, the compatibility conditions take the form\nn\nX\n\nj=1\n\n\u2212\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u03c9j {a+\nj , aj }, ak = \u00b12\u03c9k ak ,\n\n\u00ee\n\n\u00f3\n\n(3)\n\n\u2213\n\u2020\nfor k = 1, . . . , n. Since the position and momentum operators are self-adjoint, we have (a\u00b1\nj ) = aj .\nIt turns out that we can find operators a\u00b1\nj subject to the latter hermiticity conditions and to the\ncompatibility conditions (3) in terms of Lie superalgebra generators.\nThere are two known classes of solutions for the non-isotropic case; we can express a\u00b1\nj in terms\nof elements of osp(1|2n) and gl(1|n). For each of these solutions, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian\nin specific Lie superalgebra representations was found in [5]. In their paper the authors give a nice\noverview of the relevant representations and their characters, and they present the energy spectrum\nby means of spectrum generating functions. For a detailed analysis, we refer the reader to that\npaper and the references therein. In this text we will summarize the elements of this paper that\nare useful for our purposes. It should be noted that we will restrict ourselves to the isotropic case\nwhere \u03c9j = \u03c9 for all j = 1, . . . , n.\nWhen both Lie superalgebra solutions are examined, it is time to move forward to the main\nobjective of this paper. The solution of the Wigner quantum system under consideration depends\non the Lie superalgebra representation V , in which the operators a\u00b1\nj act. So the purpose is to study\n\n2\n\n\fproperties of the Wigner oscillator in different representations, one of which will correspond to the\ncanonical case. For the three-dimensional N -particle Wigner harmonic oscillator, i.e. the case n =\n3N , we want to find the angular momentum/energy contents of Lie superalgebra representations\nof osp(1|6N ) and gl(1|3N ). In particular, this means we will try to discover which representations\nof so(3) occur in the decomposition of specific Lie superalgebra representations at a given energy\nlevel. We will use the tool of generating functions to achieve this aim. The aspired results are\nknown in the canonical case, and we will compare this case to the new solutions offered by Wigner\nquantization.\nFirst, we discuss the orthosymplectic case in sections 2, 3 and 4. The osp(1|2n) solution to the\nWigner problem is discussed in section 2. All of the results in this introductory section stem from [5].\nIn section 3 we explain how the angular momentum contents of the osp(1|6N ) representations V (p)\ncan be found by means of generating functions, both theoretically as practically. The actual\ngenerating functions for representations of osp(1|6) and osp(1|12) are computed in section 4. We\nalso plot the angular momentum/energy contents in so-called (E, j)-diagrams and compare with\nthe canonical case in this section. The Lie superalgebra solution gl(1|n) is handled in sections 5, 6\nand 7. In the concluding section, we summarize our main results.\n\n2\n\nThe osp(1|2n) solution\n\nThe orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(1|2n) is generated by its odd elements b\u00b1\nj (j = 1, . . . , n).\nThese paraboson operators are subject to the so-called defining triple relations given by [6]\n\u00ee\n\n{b\u03bej , b\u03b7k }, b\u01ebl = (\u01eb \u2212 \u03be)\u03b4jl b\u03b7k + (\u01eb \u2212 \u03b7)\u03b4kl b\u03bej .\n\u00f3\n\n(4)\n\nIn these triple relations, j, k and l are elements from the set {1, 2, . . . , n} and \u03b7, \u03be, \u01eb \u2208 {+, \u2212} (to\nbe interpreted as +1 and \u22121 in the algebraic expressions (\u01eb \u2212 \u03be) and (\u01eb \u2212 \u03b7)). The even elements\nof osp(1|2n) are formed by taking anti-commutators {b\u03bej , b\u03b7k }.\nWe can use the paraboson operators to find solutions for the Wigner quantization discussed\nearlier. Indeed, writing a\u00b1\nj as\n\u2212\n+\na\u2212\na+\n(5)\nj = bj ,\nj = bj ,\nwith (j = 1, 2, . . . , n), we see that the compatibility conditions (3) are satisfied using the defining\ntriple relations (4). The Hamiltonian (1) then takes the following form:\n\u0124 =\n\nn\n~\u03c9 X\n{b+ , b\u2212 }.\n2 j=1 j j\n\n\u2213\n\u2020\nIn order to obtain that (a\u00b1\nj ) = aj , we need to work with suitable representations of osp(1|2n).\n\u2213\n\u2020\nIn the paraboson Fock space V (p) we automatically have (b\u00b1\nj ) = bj , which makes this unitary\nirreducible representation of osp(1|2n) an appropriate choice. In [7] the representation V (p) was\nthoroughly investigated, resulting in an explicit basis, matrix elements and character formulas.\nThe main theorem of that paper gives the conditions on p for V (p) to be a unitary irreducible\nrepresentation and it states the character of the representation [7, Theorem 7].\n\nTheorem 1 The osp(1|2n) representation V (p) with lowest weight ( 2p , . . . , 2p ) is a unirrep if and\nonly if p \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1} or p > n \u2212 1.\nThe character of V (p) is given by\ncharV (p) = (x1 * * * xn )p/2\n\nX\n\ns\u03bb (x)\n\n\u03bb, l(\u03bb)\u2264\u2308p\u2309\n\nThe ceiling function \u2308p\u2309 is there to cover the cases where n \u2212 1 < p < n.\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fWe have used the notation s\u03bb (x) = s\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ) for the symmetric Schur function, which vanishes\nwhen the length of the partition \u03bb, denoted by l(\u03bb), exceeds the number of variables n. The length of\na partition is its number of parts. For a deep introduction to partitions and symmetric polynomials,\nwe refer to Macdonald [8].\nFor our purposes, the character formula (6) is inadequate. Instead the following equivalent\nformula [7] for p \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1} will be more practical:\nE(0,p)\n\ncharV (p) = (x1 * * * xn )p/2 Q\n\ni (1\n\nwith\n\nE(0,p) =\n\nX\n\n\u2212 xi )\n\nj<k (1\n\nQ\n\n\u2212 xj xk )\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\n(\u22121)c\u03b7 s\u03b7 (x1 , . . . , xn ).\n\n\u03b7\n\nIn this expression for E(0,p) , the sum is over all partitions of the form\n\u03b7=\n\n\u00c7\n\na1\na2\n***\na1 + p a2 + p * * *\n\n\u00e5\n\nar\nar + p\n\nin Frobenius notation, and\nc\u03b7 = a1 + a2 + * * * + ar + r.\nIn the Frobenius notation for partitions, the first and second row denote the lengths of the rows\nand columns in the Young diagram of the partition, counted from the diagonal. For the partition\n\u03b7, a typical shape of the Young diagram is given in Figure 1.\n\na1\na2\na3\na1 a2 a3\np\np\np\n\nFigure 1: Young diagram of the partition \u03b7 in Frobenius notation for r = 3.\n\nA simple expression for E(0,p) exists when p = 1 and p = n \u2212 1. In these cases we have\n\nand\n\ncharV (1) = (x1 * * * xn )1/2 Q\n\n1\n(1\n\u2212 xi )\ni\n\n(1 \u2212 x1 * * * xn )\n.\nQ\ni (1 \u2212 xi ) j<k (1 \u2212 xj xk )\n\ncharV (n \u2212 1) = (x1 * * * xn )(n\u22121)/2 Q\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nIt is possible to find the spectrum of the Hamiltonian \u0124 in the representation V (p). In fact, a\nstraightforward technique described in [5] delivers the spectrum generating function spec \u0124, which\n4\n\n\fassigns all eigenvalues of \u0124 to a power of t. The multiplicity of an energy level E is then given by\nthe coefficient of tE . For the osp(1|2n) solution, the spectrum generating function takes the form\nspec \u0124 =\n\nX\n\ns\u03bb (1, . . . , 1) t~\u03c9(\n\nX\n\nnp\n+k)\n2\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nk\u22650 \u03bb, |\u03bb|=k, l(\u03bb)\u2264\u2308p\u2309\n\nwhere |\u03bb| is the order of the partition, by which we mean the sum of its parts. The energy levels\nare equidistant and can be written as\n(p)\n\nEk = ~\u03c9(\n\nnp\n+ k),\n2\n\nwith k = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The multiplicities of these energy levels are equal to\n(p)\n\n\u03bc(Ek ) =\n\nX\n\ns\u03bb (1, . . . , 1).\n\n\u03bb, |\u03bb|=k, l(\u03bb)\u2264\u2308p\u2309\n\nFor p = 1 all of the results above coincide with the canonical results. Indeed, p = 1 represents\ncanonical quantization.\n\n3\n\nAngular momentum decomposition of osp(1|2n)\n\nThe main objective of the present paper is to find the angular momentum content of Lie superalgebra representations related to the Wigner quantization of the 3D Wigner harmonic oscillator, both\nfor osp(1|2n) and gl(1|n) with n = 3N . Both cases are dissimilar with respect to the dimension of\nthe representation spaces, so a proper approach is needed to tackle both problems. This asks for a\nsmall clarification.\nWe would like to describe the angular momentum content with a generating function. The\nrepresentation V (p) of osp(1|2n) is infinite-dimensional, which implies that it is impossible to\nconstruct a generating function comprising all osp(1|2n) representations. Therefore, our objective in\nthe osp(1|2n) case is to construct a generating function for every representation V (p) separately. In\nthe gl(1|n) solution, examined from section 5 onwards, the representations will be finite-dimensional.\nIn that case, the generating function will contain variables characterizing the gl(1|n) representation.\nWe would like to find how the Hilbert space in which the Hamiltonian acts decomposes to so(3)\nrepresentations. In this section we will discuss the osp(1|2n) case, where n = 3N . In that case we\ncan rely on the embedding\nosp(1|6N ) \u2283 sp(6N ) \u2283 u(3N ) \u2283 u(3) \u2295 u(N ) \u2283 so(3) \u2295 u(1)\n\n(11)\n\nto come up with a generating function that represents the angular momentum decomposition of\nthe osp(1|6N ) representation V (p). Some explanation is needed to see why this is the correct\nembedding to use, i.e. to see why the angular momentum operators are elements of this so(3)\nsubalgebra of osp(1|6N ).\n\n3.1\n\nAngular momentum\n\nFor n = 3, our physical system is a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. In a canonical context,\nthe angular momentum operators are defined by M = q\u0302 \u00d7 p\u0302, or\nMj =\n\n3\nX\n\n\u01ebjkl q\u0302k p\u0302l ,\n\nk,l=1\n\n5\n\n(j = 1, 2, 3),\n\n\fwhere \u01ebjkl is the Levi-Civita symbol. Since the position and momentum operator cannot be assumed\nto commute in Wigner quantization, a logical definition of the angular momentum operators is\nMj =\n\n3\n1 X\n\u01ebjkl {q\u0302k , p\u0302l },\n2 k,l=1\n\n(j = 1, 2, 3),\n\nwhich, by means of (2), can be written as\nMj =\n\n3\n\u2212i~ X\n\u2212\n\u01ebjkl {a+\nk , al },\n2 k,l=1\n\n(j = 1, 2, 3).\n\n(12)\n\nThe compatibility conditions (3) do not contain enough information to lead to commutation rela\u00b1\ntions between M1 , M2 and M3 . However, in the osp(1|6) solution a\u00b1\nj = bj one finds\n[Mi , Mj ] = i~ \u01ebijk Mk ,\n\n(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3).\n\nThese are the commutation relations of so(3). Now, since the operators Mj are in essence elements\n\u2212\n{b+\nk , bl } of osp(1|6), they belong to the osp(1|6) subalgebra u(3) from the embedding\nosp(1|6) \u2283 sp(6) \u2283 u(3) \u2283 so(3) \u2295 u(1),\nwhich follows from [7, Proposition 3]. The generalization to osp(1|6N ) is rather straightforward.\nThe physical system is now an N -particle three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The position and\nmomentum operators have a second index \u03b1, with \u03b1 = 1, . . . , N . The angular momentum operators\nof the particle \u03b1 can be written as\nMj,\u03b1 =\n\n3\n3\n\u2212i~ X\n1 X\n\u2212\n\u01ebjkl {q\u0302k,\u03b1 , p\u0302l,\u03b1 } =\n\u01ebjkl {a+\nk,\u03b1 , al,\u03b1 },\n2 k,l=1\n2 k,l=1\n\n(j = 1, 2, 3).\n\nThe total angular momentum is obtained by adding all the angular momenta of the individual\nparticles. Thus we have\nMj =\n\nN\nX\n\nMj,\u03b1,\n\n(j = 1, 2, 3).\n\n(13)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nThese Mj are elements of the u(3) subalgebra of osp(1|6N ) and satisfy the so(3) commutation\nrelations. Therefore the angular momentum components generate the so(3) subalgebra of u(3) in\nthe following chain of subalgebras:\nosp(1|6N ) \u2283 sp(6N ) \u2283 u(3N ) \u2283 u(3) \u2295 u(N ) \u2283 so(3) \u2295 u(1).\nThe question now is how the osp(1|6N ) representation V (p) decomposes with respect to these\nsubalgebras.\n\n3.2\n\nDecomposing the osp(1|6N) representation V (p)\n\nThe starting point of the decomposition of V (p) is the character of the Lie superalgebra representation given by equation (6). Each Schur-function s\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ), with \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn ) is the\ncharacter of an irreducible covariant tensor representation of u(n) [9] and corresponds to the u(n)\nrepresentation with highest weight \u03bb, where n = 3N . In other words, equation (6) is a u(3N ) character generating function. In contrast, we want the result of our analysis to be a representation\ngenerating function. In other words, the generating function returns all representations of so(3)\n6\n\n\fthat appear in the decomposition of a fixed representation V (p) of osp(1|6N ). By means of an\nexample we will try to avoid confusion between both concepts.\nThe character of V (p) given by equation (6) is, as explained earlier, a u(3N ) character generating\nfunction. Indeed, it contains the characters of all u(3N ) representations in the decomposition of the\nosp(1|6N ) representation V (p). Such a u(3N ) character however, consist of many superfluous terms\nif one only wishes to know which u(3N ) representations appear. After all, a u(3N ) representation\nis characterized by a partition \u03bb, so a term x\u03bb = x\u03bb1 1 . . . x\u03bbnn would suffice instead of s\u03bb (x1 , . . . , xn ).\nConsider the representation V (2) of osp(1|6) for example. Following equation (9) we see that\nthe u(3) character generating function takes the form\nx1 x2 x3 (1 \u2212 x1 x2 x3 )\n.\n(1 \u2212 x1 )(1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 x3 )(1 \u2212 x1 x2 )(1 \u2212 x1 x3 )(1 \u2212 x2 x3 )\n\n(14)\n\nThe expansion of this function contains all u(3) characters in the decomposition of the osp(1|6)\nrepresentation V (2). The u(3) character generating function could just as well have been derived\ndirectly from equation (6). The partitions \u03bb in this equation have a maximum of two parts, so the\nu(3) representation generating function is created by replacing every Schur function in equation (6)\nby its leading term x\u03bb1 1 x\u03bb2 2 . We obtain\nx1 x2 x3\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n\nx\u03bb1 1 x\u03bb2 2 =\n\n\u03bb2 =0 \u03bb1 =\u03bb2\n\nx1 x2 x3\n.\n(1 \u2212 x1 )(1 \u2212 x1 x2 )\n\n(15)\n\nEvery monomial x\u03bb1 1 x\u03bb2 2 in the expansion of this easier looking function corresponds to a u(3)\nrepresentation characterized by the partition \u03bb. One can verify that the method described in the\nnext paragraph, applied to the u(3) character generating function (14), will indeed give (15) as a\nresult.\nLet us now return to the general case and consider the branching to u(3) \u2295 u(N ) in (11). The\nsubstitution\nxi := uj vl z,\n(j = 1, 2, 3 and l = 1, . . . , N )\n(16)\nin equation (7) yields a character generating function for u(3) \u2295 u(N ). The factor\nz = t~\u03c9\nkeeps track of the energy, since the power of z after the substitution (16) in (6) equals |\u03bb| and the\n(p)\norder of the partition \u03bb determines the energy level Ek , as can be seen from equation (10). We\nwill keep using this notation throughout the rest of the paper.\nBy now it should be clear that the u(3N ) character generating function (7) is not a representation generating function. Likewise, after the substitution (16) one does not obtain a u(3) \u2295 u(N )\nrepresentation generating function. Therefore, we need to describe a technique for changing a\ncharacter generating function into a representation generating function.\nFrom character generating function to representation generating function\nA character generating function for a simple Lie algebra g can generally be written as:\nF (\u03b7) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u03bb (\u03b7)N\u03bb ,\n\n\u03bb\n\nwhere the sum runs over a fixed set of integrable highest weights of g, and where each character\n\u03c7\u03bb (\u03b7) is the coefficient of a variable N\u03bb of some sort. Suppose the vector \u03b7 = (\u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7m ) has\n7\n\n\fm components, corresponding to the number of nonzero Dynkin labels of \u03bb. The Weyl character\nformula allows us to write the characters as\n\n\u03c7\u03bb (\u03b7) =\n\nX\n\n\u01eb(w) \u03b7 w(\u03bb+\u03c1)\n\nw\u2208W\nY\n\u03b7\u03c1\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2212\u03b1 )\n\n,\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206+\n\nwhere W is the Weyl group, \u03c1 is the Weyl tool and \u2206+ is the set of positive roots of the Lie\nalgebra. In order to transform F (\u03b7) into a representation generating function, one has to multiply\nQ\nF (\u03b7) by \u03b1\u2208\u2206+ (1 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2212\u03b1 ) and keep the terms in the dominant Weyl sector. All of this applied\nto our situation, where the Lie algebra u(n) has the symmetric group as its Weyl group, means\nthat we need to maintain the terms in \u03b7 \u03bb , where \u03bb is a partition. One method of doing this, is by\nmaking the substitution\n\u03b71 = c1 \u03b71 ,\n\n\u03b72 =\n\nc2\n\u03b72 ,\nc1\n\n...\n\n\u03b7m\u22121 =\n\ncm\u22121\n\u03b7m\u22121 ,\ncm\u22122\n\n\u03b7m =\n\n1\ncm\u22121\n\n\u03b7m\n\nin F (\u03b7) \u03b1\u2208\u2206+ (1 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2212\u03b1 ) and keep all positive powers of c1 , . . . , cm . This comes down to finding\nthe term in c01 c02 . . . c0m\u22121 in the power series expansion of the function\nQ\n\nF (\u03b7)\n\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2212\u03b1 )\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206+\n\n1\n(1 \u2212\n\nc\u22121\n1 ) * * * (1\n\n\u2212 c\u22121\nm )\n\n.\n\nSeveral computational software packages have specific methods of finding constant terms in an\nexpression.\nFor our u(3) \u2295 u(N ) character generating function, we would have to perform the substitution\ndescribed above for the variables ui , belonging to u(3), and vl , belonging to u(N ). Since the next\nstep in the decomposition (11) is from u(3) \u2295 u(N ) to so(3) \u2295 u(1), we want the u(N ) representation\nlabels to be replaced by the dimension of the corresponding u(N ) representation in the obtained\nrepresentation generating function for u(3) \u2295 u(N ).\nIntroducing the dimensions of the u(N ) representations\n\u03bdN\nReplacing a term v \u03bd = v1\u03bd1 . . . vN\nby the dimension of the u(N ) representation labeled by \u03bd =\n(\u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdN ) demands knowledge of a so-called dimension generating function, in which the coefficient of v \u03bd is the dimension of the corresponding u(N ) representation. The dimension of such a\nrepresentation is known [8] and equals s\u03bd (1, . . . , 1). Thus, the dimension generating function we\nneed is of the form\nX\ns\u03bd (1, . . . , 1)v \u03bd .\n\u03bd\n\nAn expression for this u(N ) dimension generating function for general N is not known. However,\nfor our purposes the u(2) dimension generating function will be enough. In this N = 2 case we\nhave\nX\n1\n.\n(17)\ns\u03bd (x1 , x2 )v \u03bd =\n(1 \u2212 x1 v1 )(1 \u2212 x2 v1 )(1 \u2212 x1 x2 v1 v2 )\n\u03bd\n\nIndeed, the summation on the left-hand side can be written as\n\u2212\u03bb2\n\u221e\n\u221e \u03bb1X\nX\nX\n\nx\u03bb1 1 \u2212k x\u03bb2 2 +k v1\u03bb1 v2\u03bb2 ,\n\n\u03bb1 =\u03bb2 \u03bb2 =0 k=0\n\n8\n\n\fwhich simplifies to the right-hand side of (17). Therefore, the dimension generating function of\nu(2) is\n1\n.\n(18)\n2\n(1 \u2212 v1 ) (1 \u2212 v1 v2 )\nWe now want this u(2) dimension generating function and the previously obtained u(3) \u2295 u(2)\ngenerating function \u2013 let us denote this by H2 (u, v) \u2013 to be \"substituted\" in one another. Saying\nthat two generating functions F1 (X, Y ) and F2 (X, Z), with common variables X, are substituted\nin each other, means that X x is replaced in either of these generating functions by the coefficient\nof X x in the other. This is achieved by finding the term in X 0 in either F1 (X, Y )F2 (X (\u22121) , Z) or\nF1 (X (\u22121) , Y )F2 (X, Z), whichever is more easily calculated. Indeed, if F1 (X, Y ) contains a term\np1 (Y )X x and F2 (X (\u22121) , Z) includes a term p2 (Z)X (\u2212x) , then we find a term p1 (Y )p2 (Z) in the\nproduct of both functions.\nHere, we have H2 (u, v) on the one hand and the u(2) dimension generating function (18) on the\nother hand. Substituting these generating functions in each other is done by taking the constant\nterm in the variables v1 and v2 in the expansion of\nH2 (u, v)\n\n1\n(1 \u2212\n\nv1\u22121 )2 (1\n\n\u2212 v1\u22121 v2\u22121 )\n\n.\n\nThis replaces the variables v1 and v2 in H2 (u, v) by the dimensions of the corresponding u(2)\nrepresentations. Again, finding the constant term can be done by various mathematical software\npackages.\nAngular momentum content\nWhat is left now is a generating function which models the decomposition of a u(3N ) representation\ninto u(3) representations. These representations of u(3) are labeled by the variables u1 , u2 , u3 , the\npowers of which represent the partition (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , \u03bb3 ) that characterizes the representation. Further\ndecomposition to so(3) is brought about by the known generating function for su(3) \u2283 so(3) [10],\ngiven here in Dynkin label notation:\n1 + P QJ\n,\n(1 \u2212 P J)(1 \u2212 QJ)(1 \u2212 P 2 )(1 \u2212 Q2 )\n\n(19)\n\nin which J is the so(3) label. Hence, the generating function for u(3) \u2283 so(3) in partition notation\ncan be written as\nG(u1 , u2 , u3 ) =\n\n1 + u21 u2 J\n.\n(1 \u2212 u1 u2 u3 )(1 \u2212 u1 J)(1 \u2212 u1 u2 J)(1 \u2212 u21 )(1 \u2212 u21 u22 )\n\n(20)\n\nAll factors from equation (19) appear in (20) in accordance with the relation [p, q] = [\u03bb1 \u2212\u03bb2 , \u03bb2 \u2212\u03bb3 ],\nexcept for (1 \u2212 u1 u2 u3 ) in the denominator of (20). This is explained by the fact that the Dynkinlabel [p, q] is not influenced when a random integer is added to every part of the partition \u03bb.\nSubstituting one of these generating functions into the other is done by a similar technique as\nbefore. One just has to multiply the first generating function, embodying the embedding of u(3)\n\u22121 \u22121\n0 0 0\nin osp(1|6N ), by G(u\u22121\n1 , u2 , u3 ) and take the term in u1 u2 u3 in this expression. The resulting\ngenerating function describes the angular momentum content of the osp(1|6N ) representation V (p).\n\n4\n\nGenerating functions for osp(1|6) and osp(1|12)\n\nRemember that the goal in the orthosymplectic case is to derive a generating function for each\nrepresentation separately. Such a generating function will be a function of two variables, J and z.\n9\n\n\fThe former labels the so(3) content of the representation V (p), while the latter accounts for the\nu(1) part. In fact, each power of z stands for an energy level.\nWe can now apply the techniques described in the previous section to derive generating functions\nfor the angular momentum decomposition of the representations V (p) of osp(1|6) and osp(1|12).\nHowever, the osp(1|6) case simplifies drastically as each representation V (p) decomposes to u(3)\nright away. Therefore we can use a different logic to find the desired generating functions.\n\n4.1\n\nGenerating functions for osp(1|6) \u2283 so(3) \u2295 u(1)\n\nFrom the character formula in equation (6) one can see that the representation V (p) of osp(1|6)\ndecomposes as a direct sum of u(3) representations labeled by a partition \u03bb, where \u03bb has at most\nthree parts. The branching of these u(3) representations can immediately be obtained with the\nhelp of equation (20). We separate three cases: p = 1, p = 2 and p > 2.\np = 1 : All partitions in the character formula (6) have length 1, so \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = 0. It is then\nobvious that the generating function for p = 1 is simply G(z, 0, 0), where G(u1 , u2 , u3 ) is the\ngenerating function (6). Not forgetting the factor z 3p/2 for the energy we obtain\nz 3/2\n.\n(1 \u2212 zJ)(1 \u2212 z 2 )\n\n(21)\n\nOne can use this generating function to derive the so(3) representations that emerge at energy level\n(1)\nEk . This information can be made accessible by means of a table in which the element in row k +1\nand column j + 1 (counted from the bottom) marks the number of representations J j at energy\n(1)\nlevel Ek in the angular momentum decomposition of osp(1|6). We call this the (E, j)-diagram of\nosp(1|6) for p = 1.\n..\n.\n..\n.\n11/2\n9/2\n7/2\n5/2\n3/2\nEk\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\nj\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n***\n\nIndeed, the first few terms in the expansion of (21) are\nz 3/2 + J z 5/2 + (1 + J 2 ) z 7/2 + (J + J 3 ) z 9/2 + (1 + J 2 + J 4 ) z 11/2 + * * * .\n(1)\n\nWe see for example that at energy level Ek = 9/2~\u03c9, there are two so(3) representations in the\ndecomposition of the osp(1|6) representation V (1), characterized by j = 1 and j = 3. Of course,\nthese results were already known because p = 1 represents the canonical case. This (E, j)-diagram\nfor instance also appears in [11].\np = 2 : The partition \u03bb now has at most two parts, so \u03bb3 = 0. The so(3) \u2295 u(1) decomposition\nof u(3) representations labeled by such partitions is given by G(z, z, 0). Therefore, we can write\nthe generating function for the angular momentum decomposition of osp(1|6) for p = 2 as\n(1 + z 3 J) z 3\n.\n(1 \u2212 zJ)(1 \u2212 z 2 J)(1 \u2212 z 2 )(1 \u2212 z 4 )\n\n10\n\n(22)\n\n\fAs in the previous case, we can generate the (E, j)-diagram of osp(1|6) for p = 2.\n..\n.\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\nEk\n\n..\n2\n1\n\n1\n2\n1\n1\n\n3\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n.\n\n1\nj\n\n0\n\n***\n\nLet us look at the case Ek = 7~\u03c9, i.e. k = 4 as an example. There are three partitions with two\nparts of order 4, namely (4, 0, 0), (3, 1, 0), and (2, 2, 0). The so(3) representations that emerge in\nthese cases can be found by equation (20). In total we have\n(1 + J 2 + J 4 ) + (J + J 2 + J 3 ) + (1 + J 2 ).\nThis is in accordance with the coefficient of z 7 in equation (22), as can be seen from the (E, j)diagram as well.\np > 2 : Since the length of the partitions in (6) cannot exceed the number of variables, we are\nlooking in this case at partitions of length at most 3. So the generating function for p > 2 is\nz 3p/2 G(z, z, z), or\n(1 + z 3 J) z 3p/2\n.\n(23)\n(1 \u2212 zJ)(1 \u2212 z 2 J)(1 \u2212 z 2 )(1 \u2212 z 3 )(1 \u2212 z 4 )\nThe (E, j)-diagram for p > 2 is given by.\n..\n.\n3p/2 + 4\n3p/2 + 3\n3p/2 + 2\n3p/2 + 1\n3p/2\nEk\n\n..\n2\n1\n1\n\n2\n2\n1\n1\n\n3\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n.\n\n1\nj\n\n0\n\n***\n\nNotice that for the lower energy levels, the cases p = 2 and p > 2 do not differ very much from the\ncanonical case. The larger discrepancies are found in higher energy regions.\n\n4.2\n\nGenerating functions for osp(1|12) \u2283 so(3) \u2295 u(1)\n\nThe previous case might have been very elementary, for osp(1|12) the computations are much\nharder. In fact, it is not practically possible to find generating functions for all osp(1|12) representation V (p). For V (1) and V (2) however, we are able to follow all the steps from section 3.2 to\nconstruct the generating function for the angular momentum decomposition. We were unable to\ncompute these generating functions for the representations V (p) with p \u2265 3.\nThe representation V (1)\nWe start with the character of V (1), given by equation (8), and perform the substitution (16), thus\ncreating a u(3) \u2295 u(2) character generating function:\n(u21 u22 u23 v1 v2 )3/2 z 3\n.\n(1 \u2212 u1 v1 z)(1 \u2212 u2 v1 z)(1 \u2212 u3 v1 z)(1 \u2212 u1 v2 z)(1 \u2212 u2 v2 z)(1 \u2212 u3 v2 z)\n11\n\n\fWe need to change this into a representation generating function. To this end, we multiply the\nprevious function by\nY\nY\n\u2032\n(1 \u2212 u\u2212\u03b1 )\n(1 \u2212 v \u2212\u03b1 ),\n\u03b1\u2032 \u2208\u2206\u2032+\n\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206+\n\nwhere \u2206+ and \u2206\u2032+ are the positive roots of u(3) and u(2) respectively. Thus we have\n\u2206+ = {(1, \u22121, 0), (1, 0, \u22121), (0, 1, \u22121)}\n\n\u2206\u2032+ = {(1, \u22121)}.\n\nand\n\nTherefore we need to multiply our u(3) \u2295 u(2) character generating function by\n(1 \u2212\n\nu3\nu3\nv2\nu2\n)(1 \u2212 )(1 \u2212 )(1 \u2212 )\nu1\nu1\nu2\nv1\n\nu2 =\n\nbu2\n,\na\n\nand perform the substitutions\nu1 = au1 ,\n\nu3 =\n\nu3\n,\nb\n\nv1 = cv1 ,\n\nv2 =\n\nv2\n.\nc\n\nWe want to keep all positive powers of a, b and c, so we multiply our function by\n(1 \u2212\n\na\u22121 )(1\n\n1\n\u2212 b\u22121 )(1 \u2212 c\u22121 )\n\nand find the constant term in a, b and c. This is the hardest step to compute.

The character of this representation was given by Berele and Regev in [13]. It is a\nsupersymmetric Schur function s\u03bb (x1 |y1 , . . . , yn ) that can be written as\ncharV\u03bb = s\u03bb (x1 |y1 , . . . , yn )\n=\n\nX\n\nc\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd s\u03bc (x1 )s\u03bd \u2032 (y1 , . . . , yn ),\n\n(28)\n\n\u03bc,\u03bd\n\nwhere the coefficients c\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd are the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and \u03bd \u2032 is the conjugate partition\nof \u03bd, i.e. the partition that is obtained when the Young diagram of \u03bd is transposed. The LittlewoodRichardson coefficients are integers and arise as coefficients in the expansion of a product of two\nSchur functions as a linear combination of Schur functions.\nEquation (28) is worth a closer look. First, we note that s\u03bc (x1 ) vanishes unless the length of\nthe partition \u03bc is equal to one, the number of variables of the Schur function. Thus, only partitions\nof the form \u03bc = (r) are allowed. In this case we have\ns(r) (x1 ) = xr1 .\nThe Littlewood-Richardson coefficients simplify a lot in this case as well. In [8, \u00a75] we find\nc\u03bb(r)\u03bd\n\n=\n\n(\n\n1 if \u03bb \u2212 \u03bd is a horizontal r-strip\n0 otherwise.\n\nTo explain what a horizontal r-strip is, we must first introduce the notion of a skew diagram.\nConsider two partitions \u03bb and \u03bd such that \u03bdj \u2264 \u03bbj for all j. In other words, the Young diagram of\n\u03bd is embedded in the Young diagram of \u03bb. The set-theoretic difference \u03b8 = \u03bb \u2212 \u03bd is called a skew\ndiagram and contains the squares that belong to the Young diagram of \u03bb but not to the Young\ndiagram of \u03bd. If \u03b8 contains at most one block per column, i.e. \u03b8i\u2032 \u2264 1, the skew diagram is called\na horizontal strip. A horizontal strip with r blocks is then called a horizontal r-strip. In Figure 2\nwe find an example of a horizontal 4-strip.\nCombining these results, we find that equation (28) can conveniently be rewritten as\ncharV\u03bb = s\u03bb (x1 | y) =\n\nX\n\nr\u22650\n\nxr1\n\nX\n\ns\u03bd \u2032 (y),\n\n\u03bd\n\nwhere the second summation runs over all partitions \u03bd such that \u03bb \u2212 \u03bd is a horizontal r-strip. The\nfirst summation is not infinite. Since the Young diagram of the partition \u03bb has \u03bb1 columns, the\n14\n\n\fFigure 2: The horizontal 4-strip \u03bb \u2212 \u03bd with \u03bb = (5, 4, 2, 2, 1) and \u03bd = (5, 2, 2, 1).\n\nhorizontal strip \u03bb \u2212 \u03bd can only have a maximum of \u03bb1 parts. So r will never exceed the value \u03bb1 .\nAnother remark is that r cannot be too small either. If \u03bb \u2212 \u03bd would be an r-strip with r < \u03bb1 \u2212 n,\nthen \u03bd would have to be a partition with \u03bd1 > n. This would imply that the length of the conjugate\npartition \u03bd \u2032 is larger than n, which means that the Schur function s\u03bd \u2032 (y) vanishes. Since \u03bb1 \u2212 n\ncould be negative, we say that r takes values between r \u2217 and \u03bb1 , where r \u2217 is given by\n\u2217\n\nr =\n\n(\n\n0\n\u03bb1 \u2212 n\n\nif \u03bb1 \u2264 n\notherwise.\n\nSince \u03bb2 \u2264 n, horizontal r-strips can always be formed for each r between r \u2217 and \u03bb1 . In conclusion,\nthe character can be simplified further as follows:\ncharV\u03bb = s\u03bb (x1 | y) =\n\n\u03bb1\nX\n\nr=r \u2217\n\nxr1\n\nX\n\ns\u03bd \u2032 (y),\n\n(29)\n\n\u03bd\n\nwhere the second sum is again taken over all partitions \u03bd such that \u03bb \u2212 \u03bd is a horizontal r-strip.\nLike in the osp(1|2n) case, a spectrum generating function can be produced. We confine ourselves to giving the energy levels of the system. They can be written as\n(\u03bb)\n\nEk\n\n= ~\u03c9\n\n\u00c4 |\u03bb|\n\nn\u22121\n\n+ r\u2217 + k ,\n\u00e4\n\n(k = 0, . . . , min(\u03bb1 , n)).\n\nThe total number of energy levels depends on \u03bb1 and is equal to min(\u03bb1 , n) + 1.\n\n6\n\nAngular momentum decomposition of gl(1|n)\n\nWe will use many of the principles of the orthosymplectic case to find generating functions for\nthe angular momentum decomposition of gl(1|n) for n = 3N . One must always bear in mind,\nhowever, that the gl(1|n) representations V\u03bb are finite-dimensional. Therefore our goal will be to\n\u03bb\u2032\n\u03bb\u2032\ncreate a generating function in which the coefficient of A\u03bb = A1 1 . . . Ann represents the angular\nmomentum decomposition of V\u03bb . We will thus construct a generating function comprising the\nangular momentum decomposition of every gl(1|n) representation V\u03bb . This is different than our\napproach for osp(1|2n), where the generating functions applied to just one representation V (p).\nAs before, the angular momentum operators will be part of the so(3) subalgebra of gl(1|3N ) in\nthe chain of subalgebras\ngl(1|3N ) \u2283 u(3N ) \u2283 u(3) \u2295 u(N ) \u2283 so(3) \u2295 u(1)\n\n(30)\n\nHowever, a little caution is required since it turns out that the angular momentum operators do\nnot immediately satisfy the commutation relations of so(3).\n15\n\n\f6.1\n\nAngular momentum\n\nThe angular momentum operators must obviously be defined independently from the choice of the\nLie superalgebra representation. Thus, just as in equation (12), we have\nMj =\n\n3\n\u2212i~ X\n\u2212\n\u01ebjkl {a+\nk , al },\n2 k,l=1\n\n(j = 1, 2, 3)\n\nfor n = 3, i.e. the three-dimensional Wigner harmonic oscillator. In the gl(1|3) solution a+\nj = e0j\n\u2212\nand aj = ej0 one finds\ni~\n\u01ebijk Mk ,\n(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3).\n[Mi , Mj ] =\n2\nSo the operators Lj = 2Mj generate so(3). The purpose of angular momentum decomposition is\nmainly finding the spectrum of operators like e.g. M 2 or M3 . Obviously, this spectrum only differs\nby a factor from the spectrum of L2 and L3 , so finding the so(3) content is again a useful problem\nto tackle in this case.\nFor n = 3N , the N -particle three-dimensional Wigner harmonic oscillator, the angular momentum operators Mj are defined as in equation (13). Again, apart from a factor\n2 these operators\n\u00bb\ngenerate the so(3) subalgebra of gl(1|3N ) in the gl(1|3N ) solution a+\n=\n2/(3N\n\u2212 1) e0j and\nj\n\u00bb\n\n2/(3N \u2212 1) ej0 . Therefore we wish to know how the gl(1|3N ) representation V\u03bb decoma\u2212\nj =\nposes with respect to the chain of subalgebras (30).\n\n6.2\n\nDecomposing the gl(1|3N) representation V\u03bb\n\nAs in the osp(1|6N ) case, the starting point of this decomposition is the character of V\u03bb , given by\nequation (29). The Schur-functions s\u03bd \u2032 (y1 , . . . , y3N ) in this character are characters of the u(3N )\nrepresentations that occur in this decomposition. The branching to u(3) \u2295 u(N ) representations is\ndone by the substitution\nyi := uj vl z,\n\n(j = 1, 2, 3 and l = 1, . . . , N ).\n\n(31)\n\nThe u(3) and u(N ) representations that occur in this branching can be deduced from the following\nknown relation:\ns\u03bd \u2032 (u1 v1 , . . . , u3 vN ) =\n\nX\n\ng\u03bd \u2032 ,\u03c3,\u03c4 s\u03c3 (u1 , u2 , u3 )s\u03c4 (v1 , . . . , vN ),\n\n\u03c3,\u03c4\n\nwhich features the Kronecker coefficients g\u03bd \u2032 ,\u03c3,\u03c4 . These are the coefficients that appear when the\nproduct of two characters of the symmetric group Sn are expanded in terms of Sn characters:\n\u03c7\u03c3\u03c1 \u03c7\u03c4\u03c1 =\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\ng\u03bd \u2032 ,\u03c3,\u03c4 \u03c7\u03bd\u03c1 ,\n\n\u03bd\u2032\n\nwhere \u03c3, \u03c4, \u03bd \u2032 and \u03c1 are partitions of n. Recently King and Welsh [14] developed a so-called \"grand\ngenerating function\" for the Kronecker coefficients. Applied to our context, we can say that when\n\u2032\n\u03bd \u2032 , \u03c3 and \u03c4 are partitions of n, the Kronecker coefficients are the coefficients of the term in z n y \u03bd u\u03c3 v \u03c4\nin the expansion of\n\u00c5\n\u00c5\n\u00e3\n\u00e3\n\u00e3\nY\u00c5\nuj Y\nvj\nyj Y\n1\n1\u2212\n1\u2212\n.\n1\u2212\n(1 \u2212 yi uj vk z) i<j\nyi i<j\nui i<j\nvi\ni,j,k\nY\n\n(32)\n\nAll products in this grand generating function run from 1 to the length of the corresponding partitions, which in our case would be 3N , 3 and N for \u03bd \u2032 , \u03c3 and \u03c4 respectively. This is already\n16\n\n\fa generating function for the decomposition of u(3N ) to u(3) \u2295 u(N ). But the grand generating\nfunction is not a u(3) \u2295 u(N ) representation generating function since its expansion contains many\nterms of the form y \u03bc1 u\u03bc2 v \u03bc3 z n in which \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 and \u03bc3 are not partitions. However, the same technique as for the orthosymplectic case will turn the grand generating function into a representation\ngenerating function. This step is computationally very demanding and can only be performed for\nspecific types of u(3N ) representations.\nOnce this step is done, the rest is easy. The u(N ) labels v1 , . . . , vN need to be replaced by\nthe dimensions of their corresponding u(N ) representations as before. The resulting generating\nfunction then needs to substituted into the generating function (20) for the branching u(3) \u2283 so(3).\nGenerating functions for the angular momentum decomposition of the gl(1|3N ) representations\nV\u03bb , where \u03bb1 = 1, have been constructed for general values of N in [15] using a different group\ntheoretical method. We were able to extend these results to other forms of \u03bb, but only for gl(1|3)\nand gl(1|6). For other values of N the computations prove to be too hard.\n\n7\n\nGenerating functions for gl(1|3) and gl(1|6)\n\nSince the length of the partition \u03bb is arbitrary, a generating function in which the coefficient of\nA\u03bb = A\u03bb1 1 A\u03bb2 2 . . . is the angular momentum decomposition of the gl(1|3N ) representation V\u03bb would\nhave an infinite amount of variables Ai . Therefore we choose this angular momentum decomposition\n\u03bb\u2032\n\u03bb\u2032\nto be accompanied by A1 1 . . . Ann , thus creating a generating function with n = 3N variables. This\nis possible because only the values of \u03bb\u20321 , . . . , \u03bb\u2032n affect the angular momentum decomposition of V\u03bb ,\nas can be seen from the character formula (29).\nIn the previous section we explained how a generating function for the decomposition of a u(3N )\nrepresentation in accordance with the chain of subalgebras\nu(3N ) \u2283 u(3) \u2295 u(N ) \u2283 so(3) \u2295 u(1)\ncan be created. Let us denote this generating function by H(J, A1 , . . . , An ). The angular momentum decomposition of the gl(1|3N ) representation V\u03bb will then be described by the following\ngenerating function:\nH(J, A1 , . . . , An ) z\n\n|\u03bb|\n+r \u2217\nn\u22121\n\nmin(\u03bb1 ,n)\n\nY\n\n(1 + Ai z).\n\n(33)\n\ni=1\n|\u03bb|\n+ r \u2217 , which explains\nTo see why this is true, we first note that the bottom energy level equals n\u22121\n\u2217\nthe power of z in (33). Each value of r = r + k then defines a new energy level and is thus\nresponsible for an extra factor z. For reasons of clarity, the rest of the analysis will be done for a\ntypical partition \u03bb, with \u03bb1 \u2265 n. The same ideas can be adopted in the atypical cases.\nFor r = \u03bb1 \u2212 n, i.e. on the ground energy level, there is only one partition \u03bd for which \u03bb \u2212 \u03bd\nis a horizontal r-strip. Its conjugate can be written as \u03bd \u2032 = (\u03bb\u20321 , . . . , \u03bb\u2032n ). The corresponding representation of u(3N ) decomposes to so(3) as described by the generating function H(J, A1 , . . . , An ),\nso there must be at least one term\nH(J, A1 , . . . , An )\n\nin the generating function we are trying to describe. In general there are n partitions \u03bd such that\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bd is a horizontal (\u03bb1 \u2212 n + 1)-strip. Their conjugate partitions are of the form\n\u03bd \u2032 = (\u03bb\u20321 , . . . , \u03bb\u2032i \u2212 1, . . . , \u03bb\u2032n ),\nwhere i = 1, . . . , n. The angular momentum decomposition of the u(3N ) representations character\u03bb\u2032\n\u03bb\u2032\nized by these partitions will be in the coefficient of A1 1 . . . Ann in Ai H(J, A1 , . . . , An ). Therefore,\n17\n\n\four generating function must also contain the term\nH(J, A1 , . . . , An ) z (A1 + * * * + An ).\nNote that it is possible that \u03bb\u2032i = \u03bb\u2032i+1 , in which case \u03bd \u2032 would not be a partition. However, in this\n\u2032\ncase the coefficient of A\u03bd in H(J, A1 , . . . , An ) will be zero. In other words, this \"non-partition\"\nwill not be counted at all.\nThe factor (A1 + * * * + An ) in the term for r = \u03bb1 \u2212 n + 1 is in fact the elementary symmetric\npolynomial e1 (A1 , . . . , An ). The elementary symmetric polynomial ei in n variables is defined by\nthe sum of all possible products of i out of the n variables. We refer to Macdonald [8] for a more\nelaborate introduction to elementary symmetric polynomials. For r = \u03bb1 \u2212 n + 2 there are typically\nn(n \u2212 1)/2 partitions \u03bd for which \u03bb \u2212 \u03bd is a horizontal r-strip. An analogous reasoning as before\nshows that they are responsible for a term\nH(J, A1 , . . . , An ) z 2\n\nX\n\nAi Aj\n\n1\u2264i<j\u2264n\n\nin our generating function. This term contains the elementary symmetric function e2 (A1 , . . . , An ).\nTaking all values of r into account, it is not so hard to see that the generating function for the\nangular momentum decomposition of the gl(1|3N ) representation V\u03bb equals\nH(J, A1 , . . . , An ) z\n\n|\u03bb|\n+\u03bb1 \u2212n\nn\u22121\n\nn\nX\n\nei (A1 , . . . , An )z i\n\ni=0\n\nin the typical case where \u03bb1 \u2265 n. In this expression we find back the generating function for\nelementary symmetric functions, which can be rewritten (see for example Macdonald [8]) as\nn\nX\n\nei (A1 , . . . , An )z i =\n\ni=0\n\nn\nY\n\n(1 + Ai z).\n\ni=1\n\nFor the atypical cases, where \u03bb1 < n, we can build up a similar analysis to eventually obtain the\ngenerating function in equation (33).\nClearly, the most important part of our problem is finding the u(3N ) \u2283 so(3) generating\nfunction H(J, A1 , . . . , An ). However, for gl(1|3) this step is trivial, so the results can be written\ndown immediately.\n\n7.1\n\nGenerating functions for gl(1|3) \u2283 so(3)\n\nFor the main part, the decomposition of the representation V\u03bb of gl(1|3) following the branching\ngl(1|3) \u2283 u(3) \u2283 so(3)\nis described by the generating function G(A1 , A2 , A3 ) given by equation (20), where A1 , A2 and\nA3 label the first three parts of the conjugate partition of \u03bb. The rest of the generating function\nfollows from the previous discussion, equation (33) in particular, and depends on \u03bb1 . For \u03bb1 \u2265 3\nwe find\n|\u03bb|\n(1 + A1 z)(1 + A2 z)(1 + A3 z)(1 + A21 A2 J)\n\u2217\n.\n(34)\nz 2 +r\n(1 \u2212 A1 A2 A3 )(1 \u2212 A1 J)(1 \u2212 A1 A2 J)(1 \u2212 A21 )(1 \u2212 A21 A22 )\nThe cases where l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 2 and l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 1 are easily deduced from this equation by setting A3 = 0\nand A2 = A3 = 0 respectively. For l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 1 we find back the results from King, Stoilova and Van\nder Jeugt in [15].\n18\n\n\fThe generating function (34) allows us to construct (E, j)-diagrams for any gl(1|3) representation V\u03bb . Some examples for the typical case are given below, with \u03bba = (3, 1, 0) and \u03bbb =\n(3, 2, 2, 1, 1).\n5\n4\n3\n2\nEk\u03bba\n\n1\n1\n\nj\n\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n15/2\n13/2\n11/2\n9/2\nEk\u03bbb\n\nand\n\n1\n3\n3\n\n2\n3\n3\n2\n\n1\n4\n4\n1\n\n1\n2\n2\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\nj\n\n0\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nThe information of these (E, j)-diagrams can be obtained from the coefficient of A\u03bda and A\u03bdb in the\nexpansion of (34), for \u03bda\u2032 = (2, 1, 1) and \u03bdb\u2032 = (5, 3, 1) respectively. As a primary difference with the\ncanonical case (and the osp(1|6N ) case in general) we see that there is a finite amount of energy\nlevels. Also, at the bottom energy level we see more than one so(3)-multiplet. The first (E, j)diagram, where \u03bb = (3, 1, 0) shows an exception to this remark. We also note that we still have\nequidistant energy levels, and that there are again higher multiplicities of so(3) representations.\nIn the atypical cases, the number of energy levels decreases as the length of \u03bb becomes smaller.\nFor \u03bb = (2, 1, 1) we have\n1\n1\n4\n2 1 1\n3\n1 1 1\n2\n\u03bb\nEk\nj 0 1 2 3\nThere are only three energy levels in this case, and we observe that the vertical symmetry of the\n(E, j)-diagram is now gone.\n\n7.2\n\nGenerating functions for gl(1|6) \u2283 so(3)\n\nThe case gl(1|3) is deceivingly simple compared to gl(1|6). In fact, it will no longer be possible to\nconstruct the generating function H(J, A1 , . . . , A6 ) for all representations of u(6). More precisely,\nwe will only be able to handle the cases l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 1 and l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 2 completely, where \u03bb is the partition\nthat characterizes the gl(1|6) representation V\u03bb .\nThe representation V\u03bb with l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 1\nWe follow the procedure described in section 6.2 to obtain a generating function H(J, A1 ) which\nwill describe the angular momentum generating function for the u(6) representation characterized\nby a partition \u03bd \u2032 , where \u03bd \u2032 contains of one part only. The starting point is the grand generating\nfunction (32) for N = 2:\n(1 \u2212\n\nu2\nu1 )(1\n\n\u2212\n\nu3\nu1 )(1\n\n\u2212\n\nu3\nu2 )(1\n\n\u2212\n\nv2\nv1 )\n\n(1 \u2212 u1 v1 A1 )(1 \u2212 u2 v1 A1 )(1 \u2212 u3 v1 A1 )(1 \u2212 u1 v2 A1 )(1 \u2212 u2 v2 A1 )(1 \u2212 u3 v2 A1 )\n\n,\n\nwhere we have taken into account the fact that \u03bb1 = l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 1 and therefore only one parameter\nA1 is necessary to describe the u(6) representation. We recognize this function from the V (1)\nrepresentation of osp(1|12), where the starting function was the same. Thus, the rest of the analysis\ncan be adopted from that case and eventually we find\nH(J, A1 ) =\n\n(1 + JA21 )\n.\n(1 \u2212 A21 )3 (1 \u2212 JA1 )2\n19\n\n\fThe generating function for the angular momentum decomposition of the gl(1|6) representation V\u03bb ,\nwith l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 1, then follows from equation (33) and is equal to\nz\n\n|\u03bb|\n5\n\n(1 + A1 z) (1 + JA21 )\n.\n(1 \u2212 A21 )3 (1 \u2212 JA1 )2\n\n(35)\n\nThis is again confirmed by the results in [15].\nThe representation V\u03bb with l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 2\nCompared to the case where l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 1, the denominator of the grand generating function will\nhave six extra factors containing A2 , and the numerator must have an extra factor (1 \u2212 A2 /A1 ).\nFrom that point on, essentially all computations run along previously traveled paths. Yet, the\ncomputer has a much harder time performing these computations, and we have the end result (see\nAppendix A) as a witness. Some intermediate results are however interesting. The u(3) \u2295 u(2)\nrepresentation generating function in this case equals N/D with\nN = 1 + u21 v 21 A21 + u221 v 32 A32 + u321 v 42 A33 + u321 v 33 A42 \u2212 2u321 v 42 A42\n\u2212 u421 v 52 A43 \u2212 u421 v 43 A52 \u2212 u422 v 53 A53 \u2212 u431 v 53 A53 \u2212 u432 v 63 A54\n\u2212 u432 v 54 A63 \u2212 2u532 v 64 A64 + u532 v 73 A64 + u532 v 64 A73 + u632 v 74 A74\n\n(36a)\n\n+ u643 v 85 A85 + u853 v 10,6 A10,6\nand\nD = (1 \u2212 u1 v 1 A1 )(1 \u2212 u2 v 11 A11 )(1 \u2212 u11 v 2 A11 )(1 \u2212 u11 v 11 A2 )(1 \u2212 u111 v 21 A21 )\n(1 \u2212 u22 v 22 A22 )(1 \u2212 u211 v 31 A22 )(1 \u2212 u211 v 22 A31 )(1 \u2212 u222 v 33 A33 ),\n\n(36b)\n\nwhere we have used the notation u\u03c3 = u\u03c31 1 u\u03c32 2 u\u03c33 3 , and similarly for v and A. This generating\nfunction was first obtained by Patera and Sharp [16] as a plethysm generating function for tworowed representations of SU (n). In this paper, we have already computed N/D given by equation\n(36) independently, not using the grand generating function of King and Welsh. Indeed, this\ngenerating function and the function N/D, with numerator and denominator given by equation\n(25), are similar. The only difference is that A\u03bb in (36) has been changed into z |\u03bb| in equation\n(25). The functions N/D given by equations (25) and (36) represent the u(3) \u2295 u(2) branching of\nall u(6) representations occurring in the representation V (2) of osp(1|12) and V\u03bb (with l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 2)\nof gl(1|6) respectively. The u(6) representations that occur in both cases are characterized by a\npartition with a maximum length of two, so both generating functions must be equal.\nIntroducing the dimensions of the u(2) representations in our u(3)\u2295u(2) representation generating function, and then substituting the result into G(u1 , u2 , u3 ) gives us the function H(J, A1 , A2 ).\nThe unappealing sight of this function forces us to relocate its full expression to Appendix A. We\ncan still write our angular momentum content generating function as\nz\n\n|\u03bb|\n5\n\n(1 + A1 z)(1 + A2 z) H(J, A1 , A2 ).\n\nNote that for A2 = 0 we must find back equation (35), which is indeed the case. It is interesting\nto see what happens when the powers of A1 and A2 are equal. This means that we are looking\nat u(6) representations with character s\u03bd \u2032 (A1 , A2 ), where \u03bd \u2032 is a partition for which both rows\nhave equal length. These representations are of interest in complexity theory and in the study of\nqubits [17, 18]. The generating function in this case can be computed out of the previous one by\nmaking the substitution\nA2\nA1 = aA1 ,\nA2 =\na\n20\n\n\fand then looking for the constant term in a. We find that the u(6) \u2283 u(3) \u2295 u(2) branching is\nrepresented by the generating function\n(1 + u321 v 42 A33 )\n,\n(1 \u2212 u2 v 11 A11 )(1 \u2212 u11 v 2 A11 )(1 \u2212 u22 v 22 A22 )(1 \u2212 u211 v 31 A22 )(1 \u2212 u222 v 33 A33 )\na result which was obtained recently by King and Welsh [14]. This confirms earlier observations\nconcerning inner products of Schur functions [19, 20]. The generating function H\u03bb\u20321 =\u03bb\u20322 (J, A1 , A2 ) =\nN/D, with\nN = 1 \u2212 A + 2A22 + 3JA22 + 3J 2 A22 \u2212 A33 \u2212 3JA33 \u2212 4J 2 A33 \u2212 3J 3 A33 + A44\n+ 3JA44 \u2212 2J 2 A44 + 3J 3 A44 + J 4 A44 \u2212 3JA55 \u2212 4J 2 A55 \u2212 3J 3 A55 \u2212 J 4 A55\n+ 3J 2 A66 + 3J 3 A66 + 2J 4 A66 \u2212 J 4 A77 + J 4 A88\nand\nD = (1 \u2212 A11 )2 (1 \u2212 JA11 )3 (1 \u2212 J 2 A11 ) (1 \u2212 A22 )4 ,\ndescribes the further branching of a two-rowed u(6) representation to so(3). Note that we cannot\nuse this generating function to describe the angular momentum decomposition of the gl(1|6) representation V\u03bb , for which \u03bb is a partition with two columns of equal length in the Young diagram.\nIndeed, solving such a problem would require the angular momentum decomposition of all u(6) representations characterized by a partition \u03bd \u2032 , such that \u03bb \u2212 \u03bd is a horizontal r-strip, with r = 0, 1, 2.\nFor r = 1, the partition \u03bd \u2032 does not consist of two rows of equal length (in fact, \u03bd1\u2032 = \u03bd2\u2032 + 1), thus\nthe generating function H\u03bb\u20321 =\u03bb\u20322 (J, A1 , A2 ) is of no use for u(6) representations characterized by this\nparticular partition \u03bd \u2032 .\nThe representation V\u03bb with l(\u03bb\u2032 ) = 3\nComputationally, this case can only be worked out when \u03bb\u20321 = \u03bb\u20322 = \u03bb\u20323 . A three-rowed u(6)\nrepresentation where all rows are of equal length decomposes to u(3) \u2295 u(2) in accordance with the\ngenerating function of the form N/D, with\nN = 1 \u2212 u111 v 21 A111 \u2212 u321 v 33 A222 + u222 v 42 A222 + u321 v 42 A222 + 2u432 v 54 A333\n+ u531 v 54 A333 \u2212 u432 v 63 A333 \u2212 v 75 u543 A444 + u642 v 66 A444 \u2212 2u642 v 75 A444\n\u2212 u753 v 87 A555 \u2212 u852 v 87 A555 + u753 v 96 A555 + u963 v 10,8 A666 \u2212 u10,7,4 v 12,9 A777\nand\nD = (1 \u2212 u111 v 21 A111 )(1 \u2212 u21 v 21 A111 )(1 \u2212 u111 v 3 A111 )(1 \u2212 u321 v 33 A222 )\n\u00d7 (1 \u2212 u33 v 33 A222 )(1 \u2212 u411 v 33 A222 )(1 \u2212 u444 v 66 A444 )\nThe same representation of u(6) decomposes to so(3) in accordance with the generating function\nH\u03bb\u20321 =\u03bb\u20322 =\u03bb\u20323 (J, A1 , A2 , A3 ) = N/D, with\nN = 1 + 2JA222 + 3J 2 A222 + J 3 A222 + 2JA333 \u2212 2J 2 A333 \u2212 2J 3 A333 \u2212 2J 4 A333\n+ A444 \u2212 4J 2 A444 \u2212 4J 3 A444 + J 5 A444 \u2212 2JA555 \u2212 2J 2 A555 \u2212 2J 3 A555\n+ 2J 4 A555 + J 2 A666 + 3J 3 A666 + 2J 4 A666 + J 5 A888\nand\nD = (1 \u2212 A111 )4 (1 \u2212 JA111 )2 (1 \u2212 J 2 A111 )2 (1 \u2212 A222 )3 .\nThe argumentation given in the previous section implies again that this generating function does not\ncontain sufficient information for the angular momentum decomposition of the gl(1|6) representation\nV\u03bb , with \u03bb\u20321 = \u03bb\u20322 = \u03bb\u20323 .\n21\n\n\f8\n\nConclusions\n\nFor a 3D N -particle Wigner harmonic oscillator, operator solutions exist in terms of generators of\nthe Lie superalgebras osp(1|6N ) and gl(1|3N ). These operators act in representation spaces of these\nLie superalgebras. Our goal was to find the angular momentum/energy contents of the representations V (p) of osp(1|6N ) and V\u03bb of gl(1|3N ). For N = 1, we have been able to construct generating\nfunctions representing the angular momentum decomposition for all of these representations. For\nN = 2, the computer allowed us to construct only partial results. For osp(1|12) we have generating\nfunctions for the representations V (1) and V (2), but for other representations the results proved\ncomputationally too hard. In the gl(1|6) case, we had to restrict ourselves to representations V\u03bb\nfor which \u03bb had a maximum of two columns.\nBy means of the obtained generating functions, we were able to plot the angular momentum/energy contents in so-called (E, j)-diagrams. These are tables showing the multiplicities of all\nangular momentum values at each energy level. These tables are a practical tool to compare the\nresults of the new Wigner solutions to the well-known canonical case.\nFor the 1-dimensional Wigner harmonic oscillator, investigated by Wigner in [1], the energy\nlevels in the non-canonical solutions are shifted in height but remain equidistant. The (E, j)diagrams in the osp(1|6N ) solution show that for all representations V (p) we have a similar behavior\nfor the angular momentum contents. Apart from the shifted energy levels, the structure of the\n(E, j)-diagrams in the non-canonical solutions is the same as that for the representation V (1) of\nosp(1|6). The main difference is that the multiplicities of the angular momentum representations\ncan be higher than 1, a feature not observed in the canonical case.\nIn the gl(1|3N ) solution, the situation is drastically different due to the finite-dimensional nature\nof the representations. There is a finite amount of energy levels and the number of so(3)-multiplets,\nthe angular momentum contents, does not increase when the energy gets higher. On the contrary,\nfor higher (and lower) energy levels we see less so(3)-multiplets than in the bulk of the energy\nspectrum.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank Prof. R. C.
