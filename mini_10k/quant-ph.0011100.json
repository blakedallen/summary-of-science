Pulses can penetrate a seemingly superluminal barrier and\nare reflected when the flow slows down.\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0011100v3 24 Jan 2002\n\n42.50.Gy, 03.30.+p\n\nImagine a wave packet propagating in a moving\nmedium. Suppose first that the medium travels as\na whole with uniform velocity. In this case we can\nconstruct a co-moving frame of coordinates where the\nmedium is frozen. The observed speed of the pulse is\nthe velocity of the wave packet in the co-moving frame\ntransformed back to the laboratory frame. This mental\nexercise gives Einstein's addition theorem of velocities,\nwhich, in the case when both wave and medium propagate much slower than c, is reduced to the Galilean rule\nthat the velocities of wave and medium simply add up.\nNow imagine a non-uniformly moving medium, for example a gas flow through a nozzle. The addition theorem of velocities is still valid locally in each infinitesimal\npiece of the medium. Consequently, a wave packet moving against the current will never enter a region where the\nflow is faster than the wave velocity in the medium. So,\nif we send in a pulse of slow light [1\u20135] to move against\nthe flow we would expect the pulse to freeze or to run\nbackwards [6] when the speed of the medium exceeds\nthe group velocity vg . Yet exactly the opposite happens.\nThe pulse will thrive beyond the anticipated superluminal barrier and will even become faster. On the other\nhand, the pulse will bounce back when, paradoxically,\nthe flow slows down. This effect is sensitive to minute\nchanges in flow speed and can be applied in precision\nmeasurements of flows with the present state of the art\nin slowing down light [1\u20135].\nLet us examine the propagation of slow-light pulses in\nmoving media. We assume that both the flow speed and\nthe material parameters of the medium do not change\nsignificantly within the range of an optical wavelength. In\nthis case we can describe light by the dispersion relation\n[7] between the wave vector k\u2032 and the frequency \u03c9 \u2032 ,\nk \u20322 \u2212\n\n\u03c9 \u20322\n\u03c9 \u20322\n\u2212 \u03c7(\u03c9 \u2032 ) 2 = 0,\n2\nc\nc\n\n\u03c7(\u03c9 \u2032 ) =\n\n2c \u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c90\n.\nvg\n\u03c90\n\n(2)\n\nThe group velocity vg has been demonstrated [1\u20135] to be\nas low as a few meters per second. The specific mechanism to slow down light to such an impressive degree\nis not relevant for the analysis presented here. Slow\nlight can be generated using Electromagnetically-Induced\nTransparency [8,9] or exploiting light-atom amplification\nin Bose-Einstein condensates [5]. Typically [1\u20135], the\nsteep linear slope (2) of the susceptibility is only valid\nwithin a narrow frequency window\n| \u03c9 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c90 | < \u01eb\n\nvg\n\u03c90 ,\nc\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u01eb being in the order of 10\u22123 . The moving medium\ncreates a local Doppler shift of the frequency,\n\u03c9 \u2032 = \u03c9 \u2212 u * k,\n\nk\u2032 = k,\n\n(4)\n\nin the realistic case of non-relativistic flow velocities u.\nConsider a pulse of slow light with a narrow range of\nfrequencies \u03c9 near the carrier \u03c90 . The Doppler detuning (4) due to the moving medium is only significant in\nthe susceptibility. Consequently, we can approximate the\ndispersion relation (1) as\nk 2 \u2212 k02 \u2212\n\n2k0\n(\u03c9 \u2212 u * k \u2212 \u03c90 ) = 0.\nvg\n\n(5)\n\nwith\nk0 =\n\n\u03c90\n.\nc\n\n(6)\n\nThe group velocity v of the pulse is the derivative of\nthe frequency \u03c9 with respect to the wave vector k, in\nanalogy to the velocity of a particle with Hamiltonian\nh\u0304\u03c9 and momentum h\u0304k. We obtain immediately from the\ndispersion relation (5)\n\n(1)\n\nin the locally co-moving frames of the medium indicated\nwith primes. Slow light is supported by an extremely dispersive medium where the susceptibility \u03c7 reacts strongly\nand proportionally to the detuning between \u03c9 \u2032 and a resonance frequency \u03c90 of the medium atoms,\n\nv=\n\nk\n\u2202\u03c9\n+ u.\n= vg\n\u2202k\nk0\n\n(7)\n\nThis formula is the addition theorem of velocities for slow\nlight in moving media. Note that the group velocity vg\n1\n\n\fat resonance frequency \u03c90 and the flow speed u do not\nsimply add up. The effective group velocity in the comoving frame is weighted and directed by the wave vector k. This has profound consequences in non-uniformly\nmoving media.\nConsider, for simplicity, a one-dimensional model corresponding, for example, to a gas flow through a tube of\nvarying width. According to the dispersion relation (5)\nthe wave vector in 1D reduces to\ns\n!\nc\nu2\nu\n(8)\nk\u00b1 = k0 \u00b1 1 + 2 \u03b4 + 2 \u2212\nvg\nvg\nvg\n\nhave not yet examined the validity range (3) of the dispersion relation (5). In terms of the effective group velocity (10) we obtain from Eqs. (4) and (7) the range\n\u03b4\u2212\n\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90\n.\n\u03c90\n\n|u0 \u2212 vg | < \u01ebvg .\n\n(9)\n\nu\n\nvg\n\nIn the case when the medium is moving uniformly with\nvelocity u0 we can construct a global co-moving frame\nwhere the pulse propagates with group velocity \u00b1vg at\nthe carrier frequency \u03c90 . When transforming back to the\nlaboratory frame we must take into account the Doppler\nshift\nu0\n,\nc\n\n(15)\n\nConsequently, the initial value of the flow speed should\nlie in the vicinity of vg . In this case the velocity (13)\nat the turning point is below u0 . Pulses propagating\nagainst the current bounce back when the medium reduces speed. This effect establishes a qualitative change\nof the behavior of pulses, triggered by minute variations\nof the flow velocity, and hence even the narrow spectral\nwidth of slow light [1\u20135] gives a comfortable margin for\nthe phenomenon to occur. Figure 1 shows a graphical\nmethod for analyzing slow light in moving media.\n\nThe \u00b1 sign indicates propagation with (+) or against (\u2212)\nthe positive current u.

Principal regimes of slow-light pulses in moving\nmedia. The figure shows the group velocity v versus the flow\nspeed u for various values of the detuning \u03b4. The dotted\ncurves correspond to the common case of zero detuning when\nthe pulse cannot freeze to v = 0. The solid curves represent\nthe interesting case, \u03b4 = \u2212vg /c, when the pulses reaches turning points outside the group-velocity gap between u = \u00b1vg .\nThe dashed lines show the marginal case of \u03b4 = \u2212vg /(2c). The\nplots are illustrations of Eq. (10) which has, however, a restricted validity range. In order to find the working points we\nemploy the pair of thick diagonal lines shown in the figure as\nwell. At these lines the Doppler detuning \u03c9 \u2212uk \u2212\u03c90 vanishes\nfor one-dimensional wave vectors k satisfying the dispersion\nrelation (5), and the addition theorem (7) gives v = \u00b1vg + u.\nExactly at the working points where the diagonals cross the\ngroup-velocity curves the Galilean rule of velocity addition is\nobeyed, but not in a close vicinity of the points. This allows a\npulse to bounce back when the flow slows down, as the figure\nclearly indicates, because the gap between the solid curves\nlies at the side of small medium velocities.\n\nThe situation is completely different when a slow light\npulse propagates in a non-uniformly moving medium.\nOnce launched, the pulse cannot change its frequency\nspectrum (unless the flow is not stationary). Consequently, the pulse cannot adapt to the flow by continuous\nGalilei transformations.\nImagine an asymptotically uniform flow with positive\nspeed u0 and a pulse propagating against the current\nwith group velocity \u2212vg + u0 . When the flow speed\nchanges from the initial u0 to a varying u, the pulse will\nreach a turning point at a zero of the group velocity (10),\ni.e. at\nr\nr\nc\nu0\nu = vg \u22122 \u03b4 \u2212 1 = vg 2 \u2212 1,\n(13)\nvg\nvg\nprovided that u0 exceeds vg /2 or, equivalently, that the\ndetuning \u03b4 reaches \u2212vg /(2c). Note, however, that we\n\n2\n\n\fOur effect can serve to sense tiny variations in flow\nspeed, as a form of slow-light sonar, because the phase of\nthe reflected light depends on the turning point (13) for\na given detuning. In order to scan a whole range of flow\nvelocities, one should simply modify the group velocity in\nElectromagnetically-Induced Transparency by adjusting\nthe intensity of the coupling beam [8].\nSo far, we have analyzed the geometrical optics of slowlight pulses, the dispersion relation and the group velocity, which determines the principal effects. Wave optics\nwill tell us the finer details. In analogy to the correspondence between classical mechanics and wave mechanics,\nwe regard the frequency \u03c9 and the wave vector k as differential operators,\n\n(a)\n\n1\n0.5\n0\nt\n1\nz\n2\n\n\u03c9 = i\u2202t ,\n\nk = \u2212i\u2207,\n\n0.1\n\n(16)\n(b)\n\nand derive from the dispersion relation (5) the wave equation for the optical field \u03c6,\n\"\u0012\n\u0013#\n\u00132\n\u0012\nu2\nc \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90\nu\n2\n\u03c6 = 0.\n+ 2\n\u2212 k0 1 + 2\nk + k0\nvg\nvg \u03c90\nvg\n\n1\n\n(17)\nWe see that the flow u acts as an effective vector potential\n[7], similar to the behaviour of waves in non-dispersive\nmedia [10]. The flow also generates an attractive \u2212u2 /vg2\npotential [11] that happens to be proportional to the\nBernoulli pressure of the fluid.

At\nthe turning point the flow speed drops by a mere 3.8 mm/s,\nwhich illustrates the extreme sensitivity of slow-light pulses\nto variations of the medium velocity.\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nFigure 3 shows that even a uniform flow can reflect\nslow-light pulses when the group velocity vg is spatially\nvarying, a regime easily achieved in ElectromagneticallyInduced Transparency [8] by modifying the intensity of\nthe coupling beam. At the turning point the velocity (10)\nof the wave packet vanishes, which gives, for a uniform\nflow u0 ,\nq\nvg = \u2212c\u03b4 + c2 \u03b4 2 \u2212 u20 .\n(21)\n\nIn this way we can benefit from the accumulated experience with one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger waves in scalar\npotentials. For instance, we can apply Heller's method\n[12] to analyze moving wave packets or use the efficient\nroutines available for numerical simulations. Figure 2 illustrates the two typical regimes of slow-light wave packets, pulse acceleration and reflection.\n\nFor \u03b4 = \u2212u0 /c the pulse is permanently frozen when the\nmotion of the medium exactly compensates the group\n3\n\n\fvelocity. A slightly different detuning, \u03b4 < \u2212u0 /c, will\nsend the pulse back as soon as vg reaches the critical\nvalue (21).\n\n[1] L. V. Hau, S. E. Harris, Z. Dutton, and C. H.

The medium supports an initial vg of 300 m/s and\ntravels uniformly with u0 = 0.995 \u00d7 300 m/s. For a detuning\n\u03b4 = \u2212u0 /c the pulse is frozen when vg reaches u0 . If we set\n\u03b4 to \u22121.00001 \u00d7 u0 /c the wave packet bounces back when vg\ndrops by 0.16 m/s, as the figure illustrates.\n\nFinally we remark that similar effects will also occur in a hot gas with a broad thermal spread of\nvelocities, provided that the two beams involved in\nElectromagnetically-Induced Transparency, the coupling\nand the probe beam, are co-propagating [6]. Given a detuning \u03b4c of the coupling beam, only the atoms which\nare traveling with the right velocity, u0 = \u2212c\u03b4c , reach\nthe narrow EIT resonance. Consequently, slow light in\nhot gases is extremely sensitive to minute changes in the\nfraction of atoms moving at the critical speed u0 .\nTo summarize, slow light in moving media shows a surprisingly paradoxical behavior when the flow approaches\nthe group velocity of light. Pulses can not only penetrate a superluminal barrier but are also reflected when\nthe flow slows down. Apart from illustrating puzzles with\nthe addition theorem of velocities in moving media, our\nfindings may lead to the slow-light analog of a flow sonar\nand they add an intriguing aspect to the fascinating field\nof slow-light optics [1\u20137,13].\nWe are grateful to John Allen and Malcolm Dunn for\nfruitful discussions.
