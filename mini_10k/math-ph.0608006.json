Much attention\nwas paid to a multiple well Shr\u00f6dinger operator in the case the wells were separated by a large distance (see, for instance, [6, 11, 8, 9], [4, Sec. 8.6]). The similar\nproblem for the Dirac operator was treated in [7]. The main result of the cited\nworks was the description of the asymptotics behaviour of the isolated eigenvalues\nas the distances between wells tend to infinity. Recently new problems with more\ncomplicated distant perturbations have been considered. S. Kondej and I. Veseli\u0107\nstudied a \u03b4-potential supported by a curve which consists of a several components [12]. In the case these components are separated by a large distance their\nresults imply an asymptotic estimate for the lowest spectral gap. The problems\nwith distant perturbations were considered also for the waveguides. In [2] the\nDirichlet Laplacian in a planar strip was studied, and the distant perturbations\nwere two segments of the same length on the boundary on which the boundary\n\n1\n\n\fcondition switched to the Neumann one. The asymptotics expansions for the isolated eigenvalues were constructed as the distance between Neumann segments\nincreased unboundedly. These results were generalized in [3], where we studied\nDirichlet Laplacian in a domain formed by two adjacent strips of arbitrary width\ncoupled by two windows. These windows were segments cut out from the common\nboundary of these strips. The technique employed in [3] followed the general ideas\nof the paper [1]. In this paper we considered Dirichlet Laplacian in an infinite\nmulti-dimensional tube perturbed by two distant perturbations. The perturbations were two abstract localized operators. The asymptotics expansions for the\neigenvalues and the associated eigenfunctions were constructed.\nIn the present paper we consider the Laplacian in Rn , n > 1, perturbed by\nseveral distant perturbations. The number of the perturbations is finite but arbitrary and each perturbation is an abstract localized operator. The restrictions\nfor these operators are quite weak and the results of this paper are applicable to\na wide class of distant perturbations of various nature (see Sec. 7).\nIn the paper we construct the asymptotics expansions for the isolated eigenvalues and the associated eigenfunctions of the problem considered. The technique\nwe develop is a generalization of the approach employed in [1]. Such generalization\nis needed since the tube considered in [1] was infinite in one dimension only that\nis not the case for a multi-dimensional space. The main additional ingredient we\ninvolve is the technique borrowed from [13, Ch. XIV, Sec. 4]. Our approach allows\nus actually to reduce the original perturbed operator to a small regular perturbation of the direct sum of the limiting operators those are Laplacian with one\nof the original perturbations. Due to this fact we believe that this approach can\nbe employed not only for the asymptotical purposes, but also in studying other\nproperties of the problems with distant perturbations.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In the next section we formulate\nthe problem and present the main results. In the second section we employ the\ntechnique from [13, Ch. XIV, Sec. 4] and transform the equation for the resolvent\nof the both limiting and perturbed operators to a certain operator equation. We\nemploy it in the third section to obtain an equation for the eigenelements of the\nperturbed operator. We solve this equation explicitly using the slight modification\nof the Birman-Schwinger approach suggested in [5]. This allows us to prove the\nmain results in the sixth section. The seventh section is devoted to some examples\nof the distant perturbation to which the general results of this paper can be applied.\n\n1\n\nProblem and main results\n\nLet x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) be the Cartesian coordinates in Rn , n > 1. Given any\nbounded domain Q \u2282 Rn by L2 (Rn ; Q) we denote the subset of the functions from\nL2 (Rn ) whose support lies inside Q.\nLet \u03a9i \u2282 Rn , i = 1, . . . , m, be bounded non-empty domains with infinitely\ndifferentiable boundary. By Li : W22 (\u03a9i ) \u2192 L2 (Rn , \u03a9i ), i = 1, . . . , m, we denote\n2\n\n\flinear bounded operators satisfying the relations\n(Li u1 , u2)L2 (\u03a9i ) = (u1 , Li u2 )L2 (\u03a9i ) ,\n\n(1.1)\n\n(Li u, u) 6 c0 k\u2207uk2L2 (\u03a9i ) + c1 kuk2L2 (\u03a9i )\n\n(1.2)\n\n2\nfor all u, u1, u2 \u2208 W2,0\n(\u03a9i ), where c0 , c1 are some constants independent of u, u1 ,\nu2 , and\nc0 < 1.\n(1.3)\n\nSince each u \u2208 W22 (Rn ) belongs to W22 (Rn ), we can regard W22 (Rn ) as a subset\nof W22 (\u03a9i ). Due to such embedding we can define the operators Li on the space\nW22 (Rn ) and consider the operators Li as unbounded ones in L2 (Rn ).\nWe introduce the shift operator in L2 (Rn ) as S(a)u := u(* + a), where a \u2208 Rn .\nLet Xi , i = 1, . . . , m, be some points in Rn and denote X := (X1 , . . . , Xm ),\nli,j := |Xi \u2212 Xj |. We set\nLX :=\n\nm\nX\ni=1\n\nS(\u2212Xi )Li S(Xi ).\n\nThis operator is defined on W22 (\u03a9X ), \u03a9X :=\n\nm\nS\n\ni=1\n\n\u0001\n\u03a9i + {Xi } , \u03a9i + {Xi } := {x :\n\nx \u2212 Xi \u2208 \u03a9i }, and maps this space into L2 (Rn ; \u03a9X ). In what follows we assume\nthat the distances between Xi increases unboundedly, i.e., li,j \u2192 +\u221e, i 6= j. Hence\nthe distances between the domains \u03a9i + {Xi } tend to infinity and the operator LX\ncan be naturally treated as the distant perturbation formed by the operators Li ,\ni = 1, . . . , m. We can also consider LX as an unbounded one in L2 (Rn ) having\nW22 (Rn ) as the domain.\nThe main object of our study is the operator HX := \u2212\u2206Rn + LX in L2 (Rn )\nwith the domain W22 (Rn ). Here \u2206Rn denotes the Laplacian in L2 (Rn ) with the\ndomain W22 (Rn ). Our main aim is to study the behaviour of the spectrum of HX\nas li,j \u2192 +\u221e.\nLet Hi := \u2212\u2206Rn +Li be the operators in L2 (Rn ) having W22 (Rn ) as the domain.\nThroughout the paper we assume that Hi and HX are self-adjoint. By \u03c3(*), \u03c3ess (*),\n\u03c3disc (*) we denote the spectrum, the essential and the discrete spectrum of an\noperator.\nOur first result is as follows.\nTheorem 1.1. The essential spectra of Hi , HX coincide with the semi-axis [0, +\u221e).\nThe discrete spectra of these operator consist of finitely many negative eigenvalues.\nThe total multiplicity of the isolated eigenvalues of HX is bounded uniformly on\nli,j provided these lengths are large enough.\nWe denote \u03c3\u2217 :=\n\nm\nS\n\ni=1\n\n\u03c3disc (Hi ). We say that \u03bb\u2217 \u2208 \u03c3\u2217 is (p1 + . . . + pm )-multiple if\n\nit is a pi -multiple eigenvalue of Hi , i = 1, . . . , m. The relation pi = 0 corresponds\nto the case that \u03bb\u2217 is not in the spectrum of Hi . Let lX := min li,j .\ni,j\n\n3\n\n\fTheorem 1.2. Each isolated eigenvalue of HX converges to zero or to \u03bb\u2217 \u2208 \u03c3\u2217\nas lX \u2192 +\u221e. If \u03bb\u2217 \u2208 \u03c3\u2217 is (p1 + . . . pm )-multiple, the total multiplicity of the\neigenvalues of HX converging to \u03bb\u2217 equals p1 + . . . pm .\nTheorem 1.3. Let \u03bb\u2217 \u2208 \u03c3\u2217 be (p1 + . . . + pm )-multiple, and let \u03bbi = \u03bbi (X) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nlX \u2192+\u221e\n\n\u03bb\u2217 , i = 1, . . . , p, p := p1 + . . . + pm , be the eigenvalues of the operator HX taken\ncounting multiplicity and ordered as follows:\n0 6 |\u03bb1 (X) \u2212 \u03bb\u2217 | 6 |\u03bb2 (X) \u2212 \u03bb\u2217 | 6 . . . 6 |\u03bbp (X) \u2212 \u03bb\u2217 |.\nThese eigenvalues solve the equation (4.16) and satisfy the asymptotic formulas:\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 n\u22123\n\u221a\n\u2212\u03bb\u2217\n\u2212 2p \u2212l\n, l \u2192 +\u221e.\n(1.4)\n\u03bbi (X) = \u03bb\u2217 + \u03c4i (X) 1 + O lX e X p\nHere\n\n\u0011\n\u0010 n\u22121\n\u221a\n\u2212\n\u03c4i = \u03c4i (X) = O lX 2 e\u2212lX \u2212\u03bb\u2217 ,\n\nlX \u2192 +\u221e,\n\u0001\nare the zeroes of the polynomial det \u03c4 E \u2212 A(\u03bb\u2217 , X) taken counting multiplicity\nand ordered as follows:\n0 6 |\u03c41 (X)| 6 |\u03c42 (X)| 6 . . . 6 |\u03c4p (X)|.\nThe matrix A is defined by (4.15).

In this theorem the operators (Hj \u2212 \u03bb\u2217 ), j = 2, . . . , m, are boundedly\ninvertible since \u03bb\u2217 6\u2208 \u03c3disc (Hj ).\n\nIn accordance with Theorem 1.4 the leading terms of the asymptotics expansions of the eigenvalues of HX can be expressed in terms of the matrix A0 once it\nis possible to approximate A(\u03bb\u2217 , X) in the sense of (1.6). One of the possible ways\nto employ Theorem 1.4 is given in Theorem 1.5. Here the matrix A0 is calculated\nexplicitly in terms of the limiting eigenfunctions and the operators Li . We also\nobserve that this matrix is in fact the first-order term in the asymptotic expansion\nfor A(\u03bb\u2217 , X).\nOne of the general cases is that the number \u03bb\u2217 \u2208 \u03c3\u2217 is a simple isolated eigenvalue of two of operators Hi . This case is addressed in Corollary 1.6. We stress\nthat in this case the asymptotics expansions for the eigenvalues are very similar to\nones for a double-well Schr\u00f6dinger operator with symmetric wells (see, for instance,\n[9, Th. 2.8]). At the same time, in our case the number of distant perturbations\nis arbitrary and no symmetry is assumed.\nOne more general case is that \u03bb\u2217 is a simple isolated eigenvalue of one of the\noperators Hi only. The results for this case are due to Theorem 1.7. In this case\nTheorem 1.5 does not provide good asymptotics expansions for the eigenvalues of\nHX since the matrix A0 in this theorem is zero. In view of this fact we have to use\nsecond-order term of the asymptotic expansion for A(\u03bb\u2217 , X). We also note that\nin this case the leading terms in the asymptotics expansion for the eigenvalues of\nHX are smaller by order than leading terms in (1.8).\nGenerally speaking, some of the eigenvalues of the matrix A0 in Theorem 1.5\ncan be identically zero for large li,j . In this case the leading terms in (1.8) vanish.\nIf it occurs, one should employ next-to-leading terms of the asymptotics expansion\n6\n\n\ffor A(\u03bb\u2217 , X) and to treat them as a part of A0 in (1.6). Such an expansion for\nA(\u03bb\u2217 , X) can be obtained by the technique employed in the proof of Theorem 1.7.\nWe do not provide such results in the paper in order not to overload the text by\nquite technical and bulky calculations.\n\n2\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1\n\nLet \u03a9 \u2282 Rn be a bounded non-empty domain and L : W22 (\u03a9) \u2192 L2 (Rn ; \u03a9) be an\noperator satisfying the relations\n(Lu1 , u2)L2 (\u03a9) = (u1 , Lu2)L2 (\u03a9) ,\n\n(Lu, u) 6 c0 k\u2207uk2L2 (\u03a9\u00b1 ) + c1 kuk2L2(\u03a9)\n\n(2.1)\n\nfor all u, u1, u2 \u2208 W22 (\u03a9), where c0 , c1 are some constants, and c0 obeys (1.3). We\nintroduce the operator HL := \u2212\u2206Rn + L in L2 (R) with the domain W22 (R) and\nassume that it is self-adjoint.\nLemma 2.1. \u03c3ess (HL ) = [0, +\u221e).\nProof. We will employ Weyl criterion to prove the lemma. Let \u03bb \u2208 [0, +\u221e). By\n\u03c7 = \u03c7(t) we denote an infinitely differentiable function cut-off function being one as\nr < 0 and vanishing\nthe sequence of the functions up (x) :=\n\u221a as r > 1. We introduce\n\u2212n/2+1\n2\ncp |x|\nJn/2\u22121 ( \u03bb|x|)\u03c7(|x| \u2212 p) \u2208 W2 (Rn ), where Jq is the Bessel function\nof q-th order. The coefficients cp are specified by the normalization condition\nkup kL2 (Rn ) = 1. Since\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2|x|\u2212n+1\n(n \u2212 3)\u03c0\n\u2212n+2 2\n2\n\u22121\n\u221a\n|x|\nJn/2\u22121 ( \u03bb|x|) =\ncos\n+ O(|x| ) ,\n\u03bb|x| \u2212\n4\n\u03c0 \u03bb\nas |x| \u2192 +\u221e, it follows that cp \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0. Using this fact it is easy to check that\np\u2192+\u221e\n\nkLup kL2 (Rn ) \u2192 0, kHL up kL2 (Rn ) \u2192 0 as p \u2192 +\u221e. Therefore, up is a singular\nsequence for HL at \u03bb and [0, +\u221e) \u2286 \u03c3ess (HL ). The opposite inclusion can be\nshown completely by analogy with how the same was established in the proof of\nLemma 2.1 in [1].\n\nLemma 2.2. The discrete spectrum of the operator HL consists of finitely many\nnegative eigenvalues.\nThe proof of this lemma is the same as that of Lemma 2.2 in [1].\nWe apply now Lemmas 2.1, 2.2 with L = Li , \u03a9 = \u03a9i , i = 1, . . . , m and arrive\nat the statement of the theorem on Hi . It also follows from Lemmas 2.1, 2.2 with\nL = LX , \u03a9 := \u03a9X , that the essential spectrum of HX coincides with [0, +\u221e) and\nthe discrete spectrum consists of finitely many eigenvalues. It remains to check\nthat the total multiplicity of these eigenvalues is independent on li,j provided these\nlengths are large enough. Completely in the same way how the estimate (2.5) was\nestablished in the proof of Lemma 2.2 in [1], one can check that\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\nHX > HX \u2295 HX ,\n7\n\n(2.2)\n\n\f(1)\n\n(0)\n\nwhere HX is the negative Neumann Laplacian in Rn \\ \u03a9X , while HX denotes the\noperator\n!\nm\nm\nX\nX\n\u2212 div 1 \u2212 c0\n\u03c7(|x \u2212 Xi | \u2212 \u03b5) \u2207 \u2212 c1\n\u03c7(|x \u2212 Xi | \u2212 \u03b5)\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nin \u03a9X subject to Neumann boundary condition. Here \u03b5 is such that \u03a9i \u2286 {x :\n|x| < \u03b5}, and the lengths li,j are supposed to be large enough so that supports\n(0)\nof \u03c7(|x \u2212 Xi | \u2212 \u03b5) do not intersect for different i. It is clear that HX is unitary\nm\nL\n(0)\n(0)\nequivalent to the sum\nHXi , where HXi is the operator\ni=1\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 div 1 \u2212 c0 \u03c7(|x \u2212 Xi | \u2212 \u03b5) \u2207 \u2212 c1 \u03c7(|x \u2212 Xi | \u2212 \u03b5)\n\nin {x : |x| < \u03b5} subject to Neumann boundary condition. This sum is independent\non li,j and has a finite number of negative isolated eigenvalues. By the minimax\nprinciple and (2.2) these eigenvalues give the lower bounds for the negative eigenvalues of HX that implies that total multiplicity of the negative eigenvalues of HX\nis bounded uniformly on li,j provided these quantities are large enough.\n\n3\n\nReduction to an operator equation\n\nIn this section we collect some preliminaries which will be employed in the proof\nof Theorems 1.2-1.7.\nLet L and HL be the operators introduced in the previous section. For any\n\u03b5 > 0 by S\u03b5 we indicate the set of complex numbers separated from the half-line\n[0, +\u221e) by a distance greater than \u03b5. We also assume that \u03b5 is chosen so that\n\u03c3disc (H) \u2282 S\u03b5 .\nConsider the equation\n(HL \u2212 \u03bb)u = f,\n(3.1)\n\nwhere f \u2208 L2 (Rn ; \u03a9\u03b2 ), \u03a9\u03b2 := {x \u2208 Rn : dist(\u03a9, x) < \u03b2}, \u03b2 > 0, \u03bb \u2208 S\u03b5 . We are\ngoing to reduce this equation to an operator equation in L2 (Rn ; \u03a9\u03b2 ). In order to\ndo it, we will employ the general scheme borrowed from [13, Ch. XIV, Sec. 4].\nLet g \u2208 L2 (Rn ; \u03a9\u03b2 ) be an arbitrary function. We introduce v := (\u2212\u2206Rn \u2212\u03bb)\u22121 g.\nThe function v can be represented as\nZ\nv(x, \u03bb) := Gn (|x \u2212 y|, \u03bb)g(y) dy,\n(3.2)\n\u03a9\u03b2\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\ni ( 4 \u2212\u03bb)n\u22122 \u2212 n +1 (1)\nGn (t, \u03bb) := \u2212 n +1 n \u22121 t 2 H n \u22121 (it \u2212\u03bb),\n2\n22 \u03c02\nn\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Hn/2\u22121 is the Hankel function of the first kind and (n/2 \u2212 1)-th order.

Here\n2\nW2,0\n(\u03a9\u03b2 ) consists of the functions from W22 (\u03a9\u03b2 ) vanishing on \u2202\u03a9\u03b2 . The operator\nH\u03a9 is symmetric (see (2.1)), and the operator (H\u03a9 \u2212 i)\u22121 is therefore well-defined\nand is bounded as an operator in L2 (\u03a9\u03b2 ). Moreover, H\u03a9 is bounded as an operator\n2\nfrom W2,0\n(\u03a9\u03b2 ) into L2 (\u03a9\u03b2 ). By Banach theorem on inverse operator two last facts\n2\nimply that the operator (H\u03a9 \u2212 i)\u22121 : L2 (\u03a9\u03b2 ) \u2192 W2,0\n(\u03a9\u03b2 ) is bounded. Using this\noperator, we define one more function w := \u2212(H\u03a9 \u2212 i)\u22121 Lv.\nBy \u03c7\u03a9 = \u03c7\u03a9 (x) we indicate infinitely differentiable cut-off function being one\nin \u03a9\u03b2/2 and vanishing outside \u03a9\u03b2 . We construct the solution to the equation (3.1)\nas\nu(x, \u03bb) = T1 (\u03bb)g := v(x, \u03bb) + \u03c7\u03a9 (x)w(x, \u03bb).\n(3.3)\n\nThis function is obviously an element of W22 (Rn ). Now we apply the operator\n(HL \u2212 \u03bb) to this function:\n(HL \u2212 \u03bb)u = g + Lv + (\u2212\u2206 \u2212 \u03bb + L)\u03c7\u03a9 w = g + T2 (\u03bb)g,\nT2 (\u03bb)g := \u22122\u2207\u03c7\u03a9 * \u2207w \u2212 w(\u2206 + \u03bb \u2212 i)\u03c7\u03a9 .\n\n(3.4)\n\nHere we have also used the identities L\u03c7\u03a9 w = Lw = \u03c7\u03a9 Lw. Thus, the equation\n(3.1) holds true if\ng + T2 (\u03bb)g = f.\n(3.5)\nLemma 3.1.

The operator T2 (\u03bb) is bounded in L2 (\u03a9\u03b2 ) and holomorphic w.r.t.\n\u03bb \u2208 S\u03b5 . For each solution of (3.5) the function u defined by (3.3) solves (3.1).\nAnd vice versa, for each solution u of (3.1) there exists unique solution g of (3.5)\nsatisfying the relation u = T1 (\u03bb)g. This equivalence holds true for all \u03bb \u2208 S\u03b5 .\nProof. The operator (\u2212\u2206Rn \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 : L2 (Rn ; \u03a9\u03b2 ) \u2192 W22 (Rn ) is bounded and holomorphic w.r.t. \u03bb \u2208 S\u03b5 that can be established by analogy with the proof of\n2\nLemma 3.1 in [1]. Since (H\u03a9 \u2212i)\u22121 L is a bounded operator in W2,0\n(\u03a9\u03b2 ), we conclude\nn\n2\nthat the mapping g 7\u2192 w is a bounded operator from L2 (R ; \u03a9\u03b2 ) into W2,0\n(\u03a9\u03b2 )\nbeing holomorphic w.r.t. \u03bb \u2208 S\u03b5 .

This fact and the definition of T2 imply\nthat this operator is bounded and holomorphic w.r.t. \u03bb \u2208 S\u03b5 as an operator in\nL2 (\u03a9\u03b2 ).\nLet g solve the equation (3.5); as it was shown above in this case the function\nu defined by (3.3) is a solution to the equation (3.1). Suppose now that u solves\n(3.1). By direct calculations one can check that the corresponding v, w and g are\ngiven by the formulas\n\u22121\nw := (\u2206D\n\u03a9\u03b2 + i) Lu,\n\nv := u \u2212 \u03c7\u03a9 w,\n\n\u03b2\nwhere \u2206D\n\u03a9\u03b2 is the Dirichlet Laplacian in \u03a9 .\n\n9\n\ng = T1\u22121 (\u03bb)u := (\u2212\u2206 \u2212 \u03bb)v,\n\n(3.6)\n\n\fLemma 3.2.

By analogy with\nthe proof of Lemma 3.1 in [1] one can show that the operator (HL \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 :\nL2 (Rn ; \u03a9\u03b2 ) \u2192 W22 (Rn ) is meromorphic on \u03bb \u2208 S\u03b5 , its poles coincide with the\nisolated eigenvalues of HL , and for \u03bb close to \u03bb\u2217 the representation\n(HL \u2212 \u03bb)\n\n\u22121\n\n=\u2212\n\np\nX\n\u03c8i (*, \u03c8i )L2 (Rn )\n\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2217\n\ni=1\n\n+ T4 (\u03bb)\n\n(3.11)\n\nholds true, where the operator T4 (\u03bb) : L2 (Rn ) \u2192 W22 (Rn ) is bounded and holomorphic w.r.t. \u03bb close to \u03bb\u2217 . Hence, in view of (3.10), (3.11), and (3.6), the operator\n(I + T2 )\u22121 is meromorphic on \u03bb \u2208 S\u03b5 , the poles of this operator are simple and\ncoincide with the isolated eigenvalues of HL , and the representation (3.7) holds\ntrue. As it also follows from (3.11), the equation (3.1) with \u03bb = \u03bb\u2217 is solvable if\nand only if the relations (3.8) are valid,\nP and the solution of (3.1) with \u03bb = \u03bb\u2217 is\ngiven by the formula u = T4 (\u03bb\u2217 )f + pj=1 ci \u03c8i , where ci are arbitrary constants.\nEmploying now Lemma 3.1, we conclude that the relations (3.8) are the solvability\nconditions for the equation (3.6) with \u03bb = \u03bb\u2217 . Thus, the solution of this equation\nis defined uniquely up to a linear combination of the functions \u03c6i , i = 1, . . . , m.\nThe formula\n\u0001 (3.9) is valid since for the functions f satisfying (3.8) the identity\nI + T2 (\u03bb\u2217 ) T3 (\u03bb\u2217 )f = f holds true due to (3.7).\n10\n\n\fe \u2282 Rn be a bounded domain with infinitely differentiable boundary, and\nLet \u03a9\ne \u2208 Rn be a point.

The matrix B is meromorphic and its inverse thus has a pole at \u03bb(X).

This identity and Theorem 1.3 imply\nthe asymptotics for \u03c8(x, X).\n21\n\n\f7\n\nExamples\n\nIn this section we will give some possible examples of the operators Li . Throughout\nthis section we suppose that \u03a9i \u2282 Rn are given bounded domains with infinitely\ndifferentiable boundary. We will often omit the index \"i\" in the notations corresponding to i-th operator Li writing simply L, \u03a9, H, etc.\n1. Potential. The simplest example of the operator L is the multiplication\nby the compactly supported real-valued potential. This is a classical example but\nit seems that in the multiple-well case m > 3 the asymptotics expansions for the\neigenvalues were not known.\n2. Second order differential operator. A more general example is a\ndifferential operator of the form\nn\nX\n\nn\n\nX \u2202\n\u22022\nL=\nbij\n+\nbi\n+ b0 ,\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\n\u2202xi\ni,j=1\ni=1\n\n(7.1)\n\nwhere the coefficients bij are piecewise continuously differentiable and the coefficients bi are piecewise continuous. The functions bij and bi are also assumed to be\ncomplex-valued and compactly supported. We also suppose that the conditions\n(1.1), (1.2) hold true; the self-adjointness of the operator H and HX follows from\nthese conditions due to specific definition of L.\nThe particular case of (7.1) is\nL = div G\u2207 + i\n\nn \u0012\nX\ni=1\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212\nbi\nbi\n\u2202xi \u2202xi\n\n\u0013\n\n+ b0 ,\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhere G = G(x) is n \u00d7 n hermitian matrix having piecewise continuously differentiable elements, the functions bi = bi (x) are real-valued and piecewise continuously\ndifferentiable, the potential b0 = b0 (x) is a real-valued and piecewise continuous.\nWe also suppose that the matrix G and the functions bi are compactly supported\nand\nx \u2208 \u03a0, y \u2208 Cn ,\n|(G(x)y, y)Cn | 6 c0 kyk2Cn ,\nwhere the constant c0 is independent of x, y and obeys (1.3). The matrix G can\nbe zero; in the case the operator L is a first order differential operator.\n3. Magnetic Schr\u00f6dinger operator. Let b = (b1 , . . . , bn ) \u2208 C01 (Rn ) be a\nmagnetic vector-potential, and b0 := kbkRn + V , where V = V (x) \u2208 C0\u221e (Rn ) is an\nelectric potential. We define the operator L by the formula (7.2) with G = 0. Such\noperator describes the magnetic field with compactly supported vector-potential.\n4. Integral operator. The operator L is not necessary to be a differential\none. For instance, it can be an integral operator of the form\nZ\n(Lu)(x) := L(x, y)u(y) dy,\n\u03a9\n\n22\n\n\fwhere the kernel L is an element of L2 (\u03a9 \u00d7 \u03a9). We also assume that the function\nL(*, y) is compactly supported and the relation L(x, y) = L(y, x) holds true. Such\noperator satisfies the conditions (1.1), (1.2). It is also \u2206Rn -compact and therefore\nthe operator H is self-adjoint.\n5. \u03b4-potential. The results of the general scheme developed in the present article can be applied to the perturbing operators not even satisfying the conditions\nwe impose on L. It is possible if such operators can be reduced by some transformations to an operator L satisfying needed restrictions. One of such examples\nis \u03b4-potential supported by a manifold. Namely, let \u0393 be a bounded closed C 3 manifold in Rn of codimension one and oriented by a normal vector-field \u03bd = \u03bd(\u03be),\nwhere \u03be = (\u03be1 , . . . , \u03ben ) are local coordinates on \u0393. Let \u033a be the distance from a\npoint to \u0393 measured in the direction of \u03bd. We suppose that \u0393 is so that the coordinates (\u033a, \u03be) are well-defined in a some neighbourhood of \u0393, and in this neighbourhood the mapping (\u033a, \u03be) 7\u2192 x is C 3 -diffeomorphism. We introduce the operator\nH\u0393 := \u2212\u2206Rn + b\u03b4(x \u2212 \u0393) as\nH\u0393 v = \u2212\u2206v,\n\nx 6\u2208 \u0393,\n\non the functions v \u2208 W22 (Rn \\ \u0393) \u2229 W21 (Rn ) satisfying the condition\n\u2202v\n\u2202\u033a\n\n\u033a=+0\n\n\u2212\n\n\u2202v\n\u2202\u033a\n\n= bv\n\u033a=\u22120\n\n\u033a=0\n\n,\n\nwhere \u033a is b = b(\u03be) \u2208 C 3 (\u0393). We reproduce now word for word the arguments of\nExample 5 in [1, Sec. 7] to establish\nLemma 7.1. There exists C 1 -diffeomorphism P : Rn \u2192 Rn , P = (P1 , . . . , Pn ),\nsuch that\n1. The second derivatives of P and P \u22121 exist and are piecewise continuous.\n2.

The mapping (Uv)(x) := p\u22121/2 v(P \u22121 (x)) is a linear unitary operator in\nL2 (Rn ) which maps the domain of the operator H\u0393 onto W22 (Rn ). The identity\n(7.4)\nHL := UH\u0393 U \u22121 = \u2212\u2206Rn + L\nholds true, where the operator L is given by (7.1) and the supports of bi,j , bi\nlie inside {x : \u03c1 6 \u03b5}.\nThe item 3 of this lemma implies that the original \u03b4-potential can be reduced\nto a differential operator (7.1) without changing the spectrum. Thus, after such\ntransformation we can apply the results of this paper to such perturbation as well.\nThe operator L in (7.4) depends on the auxiliary transformation P. We are\ngoing to show that the leading terms of the asymptotics expansions established in\nTheorems 1.5, 1.7 and Corollary 1.6 do not depend of P.\nWe begin with Theorem 1.5. Let Lk = L for some k, where L is from (7.4), and\n\u03c8e be an eigenfunction of the operator HL associated with \u03bb\u2217 . The corresponding\nelements of the matrix A0 introduced in Theorem 1.5 are\n(0)\ne L (\u03a9 ) ,\nAi,j = (Lu, \u03c8)\n2\n2\u03b5\n\nwhere u = S(Xk,r )\u03c8r,s , and \u03a92\u03b5 := {x : \u033a < 2\u03b5}. The function u satisfies the\nequation\n(\u2206 + \u03bb\u2217 )u = 0, x \u2208 \u03a92\u03b5 .\n(7.5)\ne\nis an eigenfunction of H\u0393 associated with\nThe function \u03c8 := U \u22121 \u03c8e = p1/2 \u03c8(P(*))\n\u03bb\u2217 and therefore it is independent on P. The identities (7.3) imply that \u03c8e \u2261 \u03c8 as\n\u03b5 < \u033a 6 2\u03b5.

Bearing these relations in\nIt follows from (7.3) that U\nmind, we substitute the obtained representation for u into (7.6) and continue our\ncalculations:\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2202\n\u2202Uj\nL1 S(X1,j )u, \u03c81 L2 (\u03a91 ) =\nS(Xj,1 )\u03c8 1\nS(Xj,1 )\u03c8 1\n\u2212 Uj\nds.\n\u2202\u03bd \u03b5\n\u2202\u03bd \u03b5\n\u2202\u03a92\u03b5\n\nThe right hand side of this identity is independent on small \u03b5 that allows us to\npass to the limit \u03b5 \u2192 +0 and obtain\n!\nZ\n\u0001\n\u2202Uj\n\u2202Uj\n\u2212\nds\nL1 S(X1,j )u, \u03c81 L2 (\u03a91 ) = S(Xj,1 )\u03c81\n\u2202\u033a \u033a=+0\n\u2202\u033a \u033a=\u22120\n\u0393\n\u0001\n= bUj \u2212 bS(Xj,1 )\u03c81 , S(Xj,1 )\u03c81 L2 (\u0393) .\nFinally, it leads us to the following formula\n\u0001\n\u03bb(X) =\u03bb\u2217 \u2212 bUj \u2212 bS(Xj,1 )\u03c81 , \u03c81 L2 (\u0393)\n\u2212\n\nm\nX\nk=2\nk6=j\n\nL1 S(X1,k )(Hk \u2212 \u03bb\u2217)\u22121 Lk S(Xk,1 )\u03c81 , \u03c81\n\n\u0001\n\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u2212 3n\u22125\n\u22123lX \u2212\u03bb\u2217\n2\n\n+ O lX\nL2 (\u03a91 )\n\ne\n\nbeing valid as lX \u2192 +\u221e if the operator Hj describes the \u03b4-potential.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe research was supported by Marie Curie International Fellowship within 6th\nEuropean Community Framework (MIF1-CT-2005-006254).
