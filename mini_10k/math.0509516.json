Introduction\nThroughout this paper, let R denote a commutative ring with identity and all\nmodules are assumed to be unitary. The notion of injective modules has a substantial\nrole in algebra. There are several generalizations of this notion. One of them is the\nnotion of pure injective modules. An R-monomorphism f : M \u2212\u2192 N is said to be\npure if for any R-module L, the map f \u2297 idL : M \u2297R L \u2212\u2192 N \u2297R L is injective. An\nR-module D is said to be pure injective if for any pure homomorphism f : M \u2212\u2192 N,\nthe induced homomorphism HomR (N, D) \u2212\u2192 HomR (M, D) is surjective. In model\ntheory the notion of pure injective modules is more useful than that of injective\nmodules. Also, there are some excellent applications of this notion in the theory of\nflat covers. Thus, this notion has attended more notice in recent years. For a survey\non pure injective modules, we refer the reader to [8], [3] and [9].\nOur aim in this paper is to present two characterizations of pure injective modules.\nFirst, we show that a pure injective R-module D is isomorphic to a direct summand\nof the direct product of a family of finitely embedded R-modules. Then we deduce\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 13E10, 13C05.\nKey words and phrases. Pure injective modules, injective cogenerators, finitely embedded modules, finitely presented modules.\nThis research was in part supported by a grant from IPM (No. 83130115).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDIVAANI-AAZAR, ESMKHANI AND TOUSI\n\nour first characterization that says that over a Noetherian ring R an R-module D\nis pure injective if and only if D is isomorphic to a direct summand of the direct\nproduct of a family of Artinian modules.\nLet E denote an injective cogenerator of the ring R. Let D be an R-module. We\nshow that D is pure injective if and only if there is a family {T\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b of R-algebras\nwhich are finitely presented as R-modules, such that D is isomorphic to a direct\nsummand of \u03a0\u03bb\u2208\u039b HomR (T\u03bb , E). As an immediate consequence, it follows that D is\npure injective if and only if there are an injective R-module E \u2032 and an R-module L,\nwhich is the direct sum of a family of finitely presented R-modules such that D is\nisomorphic to a direct summand of HomR (L, E \u2032 ). Finally, we will deduce our second\ncharacterization of pure injective modules which asserts that D is pure injective if\nand only if there is a family {T\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b of R-algebras which are finitely presented as\nR-modules, such that D is isomorphic to a direct summand of a module of the form\n\u03a0\u03bb\u2208\u039b E\u03bb where for each \u03bb \u2208 \u039b, E\u03bb is an injective T\u03bb -module.\n2. The results\nFirst, we need to recall a definition and bring some lemmas.\nDefinition 2.1. An R-module M is called cocyclic if M is isomorphic to a submodule\nof the injective envelope of a simple module (see [5, page 4]). We say that an Rmodule M is finitely embedded if M is isomorphic to a submodule of the injective\nenvelope of the direct sum of finitely many simple modules.\nThe definition of the dual notion of \"finitely generated\" are also given separately\nin [7] and [1]. In the following lemma, we show that those definitions are equivalent\nto the above definition. In the sequel, for an R-module M, let E(M) denote its\ninjective envelope.\nLemma 2.2. Let M be nonzero R-module. Then the following are equivalent:\ni) M is finitely embedded.\nii) There are simple R-modules S1 , S2 , . . . , St such that E(M) = E(S1 ) \u2295 * * * \u2295 E(St ).\niii) The socle of M is a finitely generated and M is an essential extension of its\nsocle.\niv) For any family {Mi }i\u2208I of submodules of M, the intersection \u2229i\u2208I Mi is nonzero,\nwhenever the intersection of any finite number of Mi 's is nonzero.\n\n\fTWO CHARACTERIZATIONS OF...\n\n3\n\nProof. i) \u21d4 ii) and ii) \u21d4 iii) follows, by [7, Proposition 3.20] and [7, Proposition\n3.18] respectively. The equivalence iii) \u21d4 iv) follows by [1, Proposition 10.7]. \u0003\nLemma 2.3. Let M be a nonzero R-module. Then M is cocyclic if and only if the\nintersection of all nonzero submodules of M is nonzero.\nProof. First, assume that M is cocyclic. Then, there is a simple R-module S\nsuch that M is a submodule of E(S). Since E(S) is an essential extension of S, it\nfollows that every nonzero submodule of M contains S.\nConversely, assume that there is a nonzero element c \u2208 M such that c belongs to\nall nonzero submodules of M. Then, it is routine check that Rc is simple and that\nM is an essential extension of Rc. Hence M can be naturally embedded in E(Rc).\n\u0003\nLemma 2.4. Let M be an R-module. For any finitely generated R-module N and\nany 0 6= \u03b1 \u2208 M \u2297R N, there exists a finitely embedded quotient module L of M\nsuch that the image of \u03b1 under the natural homomorphism M \u2297R N \u2212\u2192 L \u2297R N is\nnonzero.\nProof. Assume that N is generated by {n1 , n2 , . . . , ns }. Let F be a free R-module\nof rank s. Suppose that {x1 , x2 , . . . , xs } is a basis for F and that \u03c1 : F \u2212\u2192 N is the\nP\nP\nnatural epimorphism defined by si=1 ri xi 7\u2192 si=1 ri ni . Let K denote the kernel of\nP\n\u03c1 and \u03bc : K \u2212\u2192 F denote the inclusion map. Assume \u03b2 = si=1 (mi \u2297 xi ) \u2208 M \u2297R F\nis such that (idM \u2297 \u03c1)(\u03b2) = \u03b1. Let \u03a3 denote the set of all submodules P of M \u2297R F\nsuch that im(idM \u2297 \u03bc) \u2286 P and \u03b2 6\u2208 P . Since \u03b2 6\u2208 im(idM \u2297 \u03bc), it follows that\n\u03a3 is not empty. Clearly, (\u03a3, \u2286) satisfies the assumptions of Zorn's Lemma, and\nso \u03a3 possesses a maximal element Q 'say. Lemma 2.3 yields that (M \u2297R F )/Q\nis cocyclic. Fix 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s, and let fi : M \u2212\u2192 M \u2297R F be the homomorphism\ndefined by m 7\u2192 m \u2297 xi . Let fi\u2217 : M/fi\u22121 (Q) \u2212\u2192 (M \u2297R F )/Q denote the induced\nmonomorphism. It follows that M/fi\u22121 (Q) is cocyclic. Let L = M/ \u2229si=1 fi\u22121 (Q).\nSince \u2295si=1 M/fi\u22121 (Q) is finitely embedded and L can be naturally embedded in\n\u2295si=1 M/fi\u22121 (Q), it turns out that L is finitely embedded. Let \u03c0 : M \u2212\u2192 L denote\nthe natural epimorphism. The exact sequence\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c1\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 K \u2212\u2192 F \u2212\u2192 N \u2212\u2192 0,\nyields the following commutative diagram.\n\n\f4\n\nDIVAANI-AAZAR, ESMKHANI AND TOUSI\n\nidM \u2297\u03bc\n\nidM \u2297\u03c1\n\nM\u2297\n\uf8e6R K \u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\u03c0\u2297id\nK\ny\n\nM\u2297\n\uf8e6R F \u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\u03c0\u2297id\nF\ny\n\nM\u2297\n\uf8e6R N \u2212\u2192 0\n\uf8e6\u03c0\u2297id\nN\ny\n\nL \u2297R K\n\nL \u2297R F\n\nL \u2297R N\n\nidL \u2297\u03bc\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nidL \u2297\u03c1\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192 0.\n\nTo show that (\u03c0 \u2297idN )(\u03b1) 6= 0, it is enough to see that (\u03c0 \u2297idF )(\u03b2) 6\u2208 im(idL \u2297\u03bc).\nSuppose the contrary is true. Then there are y1 , y2 , . . . , yl \u2208 M and z1 , z2 , . . . , zl \u2208 K\nsuch that\n\u03a3si=1 (\u03c0(mi ) \u2297 xi ) = (\u03c0 \u2297 idF )(\u03b2) = (idL \u2297 \u03bc)(\u03a3lj=1 (\u03c0(yj ) \u2297 zj )).\nFor any given integer 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l, let rij \u2208 R, i = 1, 2, . . . , s be such that zj =\n\u03a3si=1 rij xi . Thus\n\u03a3si=1 (\u03c0(mi ) \u2297 xi ) = \u03a3si=1 ((\u03a3lj=1 \u03c0(rij yj )) \u2297 xi ),\nT\nas elements of L \u2297R F . Therefore mi \u2212 \u03a3lj=1 rij yj \u2208 sk=1 fk\u22121 (Q) for all i = 1, . . . , s,\nand so\n\u03a3si=1 (mi \u2297 xi ) \u2212 \u03a3si=1 ((\u03a3lj=1 rij yj ) \u2297 xi ) \u2208 Q.\nBecause \u03a3lj=1 (yj \u2297 zj ) \u2208 im(idM \u2297 \u03bc) \u2286 Q, it turns out that \u03b2 \u2208 Q. Therefore, we\nachieved at a contradiction. \u0003\nProposition 2.5. Let M be an R-module and let {Qi }i\u2208I denote the class of all\nfinitely embedded quotient modules of M. Then there exists a pure homomorphism\nM \u2212\u2192 \u03a0i\u2208I Qi .\nProof. For each i \u2208 I, let \u03c0i : M \u2212\u2192 Qi denote the natural epimorphism. Define\nthe homomorphism \u03bb : M \u2212\u2192 \u03a0i\u2208I Qi , by m 7\u2192 (\u03c0i (m))i\u2208I . To show that \u03bb is pure,\nit is enough to see that for any finitely presented R-module N, the R-homomorphism\n\u03bb \u2297 idN : M \u2297R N \u2212\u2192 (\u03a0i\u2208I Qi ) \u2297R N,\nis injective. Note that, by [3, Construction 18-2.6] any R-module is isomorphic to\nthe direct limit of a family of finitely presented modules. It is a routine check to see\nthat the map\n\u0398 : (\u03a0i\u2208I Qi ) \u2297R N \u2212\u2192 \u03a0i\u2208I (Qi \u2297R N),\ndefined by (yi )i\u2208I \u2297 z 7\u2192 (yi \u2297 z)i\u2208I is an isomorphism. Now, the conclusion follows,\nbecause by Lemma 2.4, \u0398(\u03bb \u2297 idN ) is injective. \u0003\n\n\fTWO CHARACTERIZATIONS OF...\n\n5\n\nLet D be a pure injective R-module and f : D \u2212\u2192 L a pure homomorphism.\nThen, it follows that D is isomorphic to a direct summand of L. This easy fact\nyields the following.\nCorollary 2.6. Let D be a pure injective R-module. Then D is isomorphic to a\ndirect summand of the direct product of a family of finitely embedded modules.\nExample 2.7. By [5, Theorem 6], a Pr\u00fcfer domain R is locally almost maximal if\nand only if every finitely embedded R-module is pure injective. On other hand,\nby [2, Example 2.4] there exists a valuation domain R such that R is not almost\nmaximal. Hence finitely embedded modules are not pure injective in general, and\nso the converse of Corollary 2.6 is not true.\nNow, we are ready to establish our first characterization of pure injective modules.\nTheorem 2.8. Let R be a Noetherian ring and D an R-module. Then D is pure\ninjective if and only if D is isomorphic to a direct summand of the direct product of\na family of Artinian modules.\nProof. First assume that D is isomorphic to a direct summand of the direct\nproduct of a family of Artinian modules. By [6, Corollary 4.2], any Artinian module\nis pure injective. Thus D is a pure injective module. Note that the direct product\nof a family {Di }i\u2208I of R-modules is pure injective if and only if each Di is pure\ninjective.\nNow, assume that D is pure injective. Then, it follows that D is isomorphic to a\ndirect summand of the direct product of a family of finitely embedded R-modules.\nBut, over a Noetherian ring finitely embedded R-modules are Artinian. \u0003\nExample 2.9. There is a pure injective module which is not the direct product of\nany family of Artinian modules. To this end, let (R, m) be a Noetherian complete\nlocal ring which is not Artinian. Since R \u223c\n= HomR (E(R/m), E(R/m)), it follows by\n[4, Lemma 2.1] that R is pure injective. Assume that there is a family {Ai }i\u2208I of\nArtinian modules such that R = \u03a0i\u2208I Ai . Then only finitely many of Ai 's can be\nnonzero, because R is Noetherian. Hence R becomes an Artinian R-module and so\nwe achieved at a contradiction.\nLemma 2.10. Let \u03a9 denote the class of all R-algebras T which are finitely presented\nas R-modules. Let N be a submodule of an R-module M. Then the inclusion map\ni : N \u0592\u2192 M is pure if and only if i \u2297 idT is injective for all T \u2208 \u03a9.\n\n\f6\n\nDIVAANI-AAZAR, ESMKHANI AND TOUSI\n\nProof. It is enough to prove that the \"if\" part. To this end, by [3, Construction\n18-2.6], it will suffice to show that for any finitely presented R-module L, i \u2297 idL\nis injective. Let L be a finitely presented R-module and TL = R \u2295 L denote the\ntrivial extension of R by L. Recall that addition and multiplication in TL are defined\nrespectively by,\n(r, x) + (r \u2032 , x\u2032 ) = (r + r \u2032 , x + x\u2032 )\nand\n(r, x)(r \u2032 , x\u2032 ) = (rr \u2032 , rx\u2032 + r \u2032 x).\nConsider the ring homomorphism \u03c8L : R \u2212\u2192 TL defined by r 7\u2192 (r, 0). Clearly, the\nR-module structure on TL that induced by \u03c8L coincides with the usual R-module\nstructure of TL when TL is considered as the direct sum of two R-modules R and L.\nLet \u03bb : L \u2212\u2192 TL be the natural embedding defined by x 7\u2192 (0, x). Now, consider\nthe following diagram\ni\u2297id\n\nL\nN\u2297\n\uf8e6R L \u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6id \u2297\u03bb\ny N\n\nN \u2297R TL\n\ni\u2297idTL\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nM\u2297\n\uf8e6R L\n\uf8e6id \u2297\u03bb\ny M\nM \u2297R TL\n\nBecause \u03bb is a pure R-homomorphism, we deduce that both maps idN \u2297 \u03bb and\nidM \u2297 \u03bb are injective. Thus we conclude that i \u2297 idL is injective, as required. \u0003\nProposition 2.11. Let E be an injective cogenerator of R and D an R-module.\nThen D is pure injective if and only if there is a family {T\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b of R-algebras which\nare finitely presented as R-modules, such that D is isomorphic to a direct summand\nof \u03a0\u03bb\u2208\u039b HomR (T\u03bb , E).\nProof. It is easy to see that for any R-module M and any injective R-module E \u2032 ,\nthe R-module HomR (M, E \u2032 ) is pure injective (see e.g. [4, Lemma 2.1]). Thus the\n\"if\" part follows clearly, because the direct product of a family {Di }i\u2208I of R-modules\nis pure injective if and only if Di is pure injective for all i \u2208 I.\nNow, we prove the converse. Let \u03a9 be as in Lemma 2.10. There is a subclass\n\u2217\n\u03a9 of \u03a9, which is a set , with the property that any T \u2208 \u03a9 is isomorphic (as an\nR-module) to an element of \u03a9\u2217 . Let (.)\u2228 denote the functor HomR (., E). Also, let\n\u039b be the set of all pairs (T, f ) with T \u2208 \u03a9\u2217 and f \u2208 HomR (D, T \u2228), and for each\n\u03bb \u2208 \u039b denote the corresponding pair by (T\u03bb , f\u03bb ). Set C = \u03a0\u03bb\u2208\u039b (T\u03bb )\u2228 and define the\nmonomorphism \u03c8 : D \u2212\u2192 C, by \u03c8(x) = (f\u03bb (x))\u03bb\u2208\u039b . By, the paragraph preceding\n\n\fTWO CHARACTERIZATIONS OF...\n\n7\n\nCorollary 2.6, the proof will be complete if we show that \u03c8 is pure. To this end,\nby Lemma 2.10, it is enough to show that for any T \u2208 \u03a9\u2217 , the map \u03c8 \u2297 idT is\ninjective. Because, the functor (.)\u2228 is faithfully exact, we equivalently prove that\nthe natural R-homomorphism HomR (C, T \u2228) \u2212\u2192 HomR (D, T \u2228) is surjective. Let\nf \u2208 HomR (D, T \u2228). There is \u03bb0 \u2208 \u039b with (T\u03bb0 , f\u03bb0 ) = (T, f ). Denote the projection\nmap \u03a0\u03bb\u2208\u039b (T\u03bb )\u2228 \u2212\u2192 (T\u03bb0 )\u2228 , by \u03c1\u03bb0 . Then \u03c1\u03bb0 \u03c8 = f . \u0003\nNext, we present another characterization of pure injective modules.\nCorollary 2.12. Let D be an R-module. Then D is pure injective if and only if\nD is isomorphic to a direct summand of a module of the form HomR (L, E) where\nE is an injective R-module and L is the direct sum of a family of finitely presented\nR-modules.\nProof. The \"if\" part is clear, as we have seen in the proof of Proposition 2.11.\nNow, let D be a pure injective R-module and E an injective cogenerator of R.\nThen, by Proposition 2.11, there is a family {Li }i\u2208I of finitely presented R-modules\nsuch that D is isomorphic to a direct summand of \u03a0i\u2208I HomR (Li , E). Set L =\n\u2295i\u2208I Li . Then\n\u03a0i\u2208I HomR (Li , E) \u223c\n= HomR (L, E),\nand so the conclusion follows. \u0003\nNow, we are ready to present our second characterization of pure injective modules.\nTheorem 2.13. An R-module D is pure injective if and only if there is a family\n{T\u03bb }\u03bb\u2208\u039b of R-algebras which are finitely presented as R-modules, such that D is\nisomorphic to a direct summand of a module of the form \u03a0\u03bb\u2208\u039b E\u03bb where for each\n\u03bb \u2208 \u039b, E\u03bb is an injective T\u03bb -module.\nProof. Again, the \"if\" part is clear, because as one can see easily, any pure\ninjective module over an R-algebra T is also pure injective as an R-module.\nNow, we prove the converse. Let E be an injective R-module and T an R-algebra.\nThen, it is easy to see that HomR (T, E) is an injective T -module. Hence the claim\nfollows, by Proposition 2.11. \u0003\nReferences\n[1] F.W.
