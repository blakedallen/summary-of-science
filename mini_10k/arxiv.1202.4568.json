We consider a normal complete rational variety with a torus action of complexity\none. In the main results, we determine the roots of the automorphism group and give an explicit\ndescription of the root system of its semisimple part. The results are applied to the study of\nalmost homogeneous varieties. For example, we describe all almost homogeneous (possibly\nsingular) del Pezzo K\u2217 -surfaces of Picard number one and all almost homogeneous (possibly\nsingular) Fano threefolds of Picard number one having a reductive automorphism group with\ntwo-dimensional maximal torus.\n\n1. Introduction\nFor any complete rational algebraic variety X, the unit component Aut(X)0 of its automorphism\ngroup is linear algebraic and it is a natural desire to understand the structure of this group.\nEssential insight is provided by the roots, i.e. the eigenvalues of the adjoint representation of a\nmaximal torus on the Lie algebra. Recall that if a linear algebraic group is reductive, then its set\nof roots forms a so-called root system and, up to coverings, determines the group. In the general\ncase, the group is generated by its maximal torus and the additive one-parameter subgroups\ncorresponding to the roots. Seminal work on the structure of automorphism groups has been done\nby Demazure [7] for the case of smooth complete toric varieties X. Here, the acting torus T of X\nis as well a maximal torus of Aut(X)0 and Demazure described the roots of Aut(X)0 with respect\nto T in terms of the defining fan of X; see [6, 5, 17, 19] for further development in this direction.\nCox [6] presented an approach to the automorphism group of a toric variety via the homogeneous\ncoordinate ring and thereby generalized Demazure's results to the simplicial case; see [4] for an\napplication of homogeneous coordinates to the study of automorphism groups in the more general\ncase of spherical varieties.\nIn the present paper, we go beyond the toric case in the sense that we consider normal complete\nrational varieties X coming with an effective torus action T \u00d7 X \u2192 X of complexity one, i.e. the\ndimension of T is one less than that of X; the simplest nontrivial examples are K\u2217 -surfaces,\nsee [20, 21]. Our approach is based on the Cox ring R(X) and the starting point is the explicit\ndescription of R(X) in the complexity one case provided by [13, 14]; see also Section 3 for details.\nGenerators and relations of R(X) as well as the grading by the divisor class group Cl(X) can\nbe encoded in a sequence A = a0 , . . . , ar of pairwise linearly independent vectors in K2 and an\nintegral matrix\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u2212l0 l1 . . . 0 0\n\uf8ef ..\n.. \uf8fa\n.\n.. . .\n\uf8ef\n. ..\n. \uf8fa\n.\nP = \uf8ef .\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f0 \u2212l0 0 . . . lr 0 \uf8fb\nd0 d1 . . . dr d\u2032\n\nof size (n + m) \u00d7 (r + s), where li are nonnegative integral vectors of length ni , the di are\ns \u00d7 ni blocks, d\u2032 is an s \u00d7 m block and the columns of P are pairwise different primitive vectors\ngenerating the column space Qr+s as a convex cone. Conversely, the data A, P always define a\nCox ring R(X) = R(A, P ) of a complexity one T -variety X. The dimension of X equals s + 1\nand the acting torus T has Zs as its character lattice. The matrix P determines the grading\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 14J50, 14M25, 14J45, 13A02, 13N15.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nI. ARZHANTSEV, J. HAUSEN, E. HERPPICH, AND A. LIENDO\n\nand the exponents occuring in the relations, whereas A is responsible for continuous aspects, i.e.\ncoefficients in the relations.\nThe crucial concept for the investigation of the automorphism group Aut(X) are the Demazure\nP -roots, which we introduce in Definition 5.2. Roughly speaking, these are finitely many integral\nlinear forms u on Zr+s satisfying a couple of linear inequalities on the columns of P . In particular,\ngiven P , the Demazure P -roots can be easily determined. In contrast with the toric case, the\nDemazure P -roots are divided into two types. Firstly, there are \"vertical\" ones corresponding to\nroot subgroups whose orbits are contained in the closures of generic torus orbits. Such Demazure\nP -roots are defined by free generators of the Cox ring and their description is analogous to the toric\ncase. Secondly, there are \"horizontal\" Demazure P -roots corresponding to root subgroups whose\norbits are transversal to generic torus orbits. Dealing with this type heavily involves the relations\namong generators of the Cox ring. Our first main result expresses the roots of Aut(X)0 and,\nmoreover, the approach shows how to obtain the corresponding root subgroups, see Theorem 5.5\nand Corollary 5.11 for the precise formulation:\nTheorem. Let X be a nontoric normal complete rational variety with an effective torus action\nT \u00d7 X \u2192 X of complexity one. Then Aut(X) is a linear algebraic group having T as a maximal\ntorus and the roots of Aut(X) with respect to T are precisely the Zs -parts of the Demazure P -roots.\nThe basic idea of the proof is to relate the group Aut(X) to the group of graded automorphisms\nof the Cox ring. This is done in Section 2 more generally for arbitrary Mori dream spaces, i.e. normal complete varieties with a finitely generated Cox ring R(X). In this setting, the grading by the\ndivisor class group Cl(X) defines an action of the characteristic quasitorus HX = Spec K[Cl(X)]\nb \u2286 X by\non the total coordinate space X = Spec R(X) and X is the quotient of an open subset X\nthe action of HX . The group of Cl(X)-graded automorphisms of R(X) is isomorphic to the group\nAut(X, HX ) of HX -equivariant automorphisms of X. Moreover, the group Bir2 (X) of birational\nautomorphisms of X defined on an open subset of X having complement of codimension at least\ntwo plays a role. Theorem 2.1 brings all groups together:\nTheorem. Let X be a (not necessarily rational) Mori dream space. Then there is a commutative diagram of morphisms of linear algebraic groups where the rows are exact sequences and the\nupwards inclusions are of finite index:\n1\n\n/ HX\n\n1\n\n/ HX\n\n/ Aut(X, HX )\nO\n\n/ Bir2 (X)\nO\n\n/1\n\n\u001f?\n/ Aut(X,\nb HX )\n\n\u001f?\n/ Aut(X)\n\n/1\n\nThis means in particular that the unit component of Aut(X) coincides with that of Bir2 (X)\nwhich in turn is determined by Aut(X, HX ), the group of graded automorphisms of the Cox ring.\nComing back to rational varieties X with torus action of complexity one, the task then is a detailed\nstudy of the graded automorphism group of the rings R(X) = R(A, P ). This is done in a purely\nalgebraic way. The basic concepts are provided in Section 3. The key result is the description\nof the \"primitive homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations\" on R(A, P ) given in Theorem 4.3.\nThe proof of the first main theorem in Section 5 then relates the Demazure P -roots via these\nderivations to the roots of the automorphism group Aut(X).\nIn Section 6 we apply our results to the study of almost homogeneous rational K\u2217 -surfaces\nX of Picard number one; where almost homogeneous means that Aut(X) has an open orbit in\nX. It turns out that these surfaces are always (possibly singular) del Pezzo surfaces and, up to\nisomorphism, there are countably many of them, see Corollary 6.3. Finally in the case that X is\nlog terminal with only one singularity, we give classifications for fixed Gorenstein index.\nIn Section 7, we investigate the semisimple part Aut(X)ss \u2286 Aut(X) of the automorphism\ngroup; recall that the semisimple part of a linear algebraic group is a maximal connected semisimple subgroup. In the case of a toric variety, by Demazure's results, the semisimple part of the\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n3\n\nautomorphism group has a root system composed of systems Ai . Here comes a summarizing version of our second main result which settles the complexity one case; see Theorem 7.2 for the\ndetailed description.\nTheorem. Let X be a nontoric normal complete rational variety with an effective torus action\nT \u00d7 X \u2192 X of complexity one. The root system \u03a6 of the semisimple part splits as \u03a6 = \u03a6vert \u2295 \u03a6hor\nwith\nM\nAmD \u22121 ,\n\u03a6hor \u2208 {\u2205, A1 , A2 , A3 , A1 \u2295 A1 , B2 },\n\u03a6vert =\nCl(X)\n\nwhere mD is the number of invariant prime divisors in X with infinite T -isotropy that represent a\ngiven class D \u2208 Cl(X). The number mD as well as the possibilities for \u03a6hor can be read off from\nthe defining matrix P .\nExamples and applications of this result are discussed in Section 8. The main results concern\nvarieties of dimension three which are almost homogeneous under the action of a reductive group\nand additionally admit an effective action of a two-dimensional torus. In Proposition 8.4, we\nexplicitly describe the Cox rings of these varieties. Moreover, in Proposition 8.6, we list all those\nhaving Picard number one and a reductive automorphism group; it turns out that any such variety\nis a Fano variety.\nContents\n1. Introduction\n2.

The automorphism group of a Mori dream space\nLet X be a normal complete variety defined over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic\nzero with finitely generated divisor class group Cl(X) and Cox sheaf R; we recall the definition\nbelow.

We denote the group of weak automorphisms of X by\nBir2 (X).\nTheorem 2.1. Let X be a Mori dream space.

Let K be a finitely\ngenerated abelian group and consider a finitely generated integral K-algebra\nM\nR =\nRw .\nw\u2208K\n\nThe weight monoid of R is the submonoid S \u2286 K consisting of the elements w \u2208 K with Rw 6= 0.\nThe weight cone of R is the convex cone \u03c9 \u2286 KQ in the rational vector space KQ = K \u2297Z Q\ngenerated by the weight monoid S \u2286 K. We say that the K-grading of R is pointed if the weight\ncone \u03c9 \u2286 KQ contains no line and R0 = K holds. By an automorphism of the K-graded algebra\nR we mean a pair (\u03c8, F ), where \u03c8 : R \u2192 R is an isomorphism of K-algebras and F : K \u2192 K is\nan isomorphism such that \u03c8(Rw ) = RF (w) holds for all w \u2208 K. We denote the group of such\nautomorphisms of R by Aut(R, K).\nProposition 2.2. Let K be a finitely generated abelian group and R = \u2295w\u2208K Rw a finitely generated integral K-algebra with R\u2217 = K\u2217 . Suppose that the grading is pointed. Then Aut(R, K) is\na linear algebraic group over K and R is a rational Aut(R, K)-module.\nProof. The idea is to represent the automorphism group Aut(R, K) as a closed subgroup of the\nlinear automophism group of a suitable finite dimensional vector subspace V 0 \u2286 R. In the subsequent construction of V 0 , we may assume that the weight cone \u03c9 generates KQ as a vector\nspace.\nConsider the subgroup \u0393 \u2286 Aut(K) of Z-module automorphisms K \u2192 K such that the induced\nlinear isomorphism KQ \u2192 KQ leaves the weight cone \u03c9 \u2286 KQ invariant. By finite generation of\nR, the cone \u03c9 is polyhedral and thus \u0393 is finite. Let f1 , . . . , fr \u2208 R be homogeneous generators\nand denote by wi := deg(fi ) \u2208 K their degrees. Define a finite \u0393-invariant subset and a vector\nsubspace\nM\nS 0 := \u0393 * {w1 , . . . , wr } \u2286 K,\nV 0 :=\nRw \u2286 R.\nw\u2208S 0\n\nFor every automorphism (\u03c8, F ) of the graded algebra R, we have F (S 0 ) = S 0 and thus \u03c8(V 0 ) =\nV . Moreover, (\u03c8, F ) is uniquely determined by its restriction on V 0 . Consequently, we may regard\nthe automorphism group H := Aut(R, K) as a subgroup of the general linear group GL(V 0 ).

In particular H = Aut(R, K) is linear algebraic. Moreover, the symmetric algebra\nSV 0 is a rational GL(V 0 )-module, hence SV 0 is a rational H-module for the algebraic subgroup\nH of GL(V 0 ), and so is its factor module R.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.3. Let K be a finitely generated abelian group and R = \u2295w\u2208K Rw a finitely generated\nintegral K-algebra with R\u2217 = K\u2217 . Consider the corresponding action of H := Spec K[K] on\nX := Spec R. Then we have a canonical isomorphism\nAut(X, H) \u2192 Aut(R, K),\n\n(\u03c6, \u03c6)\ne 7\u2192 (\u03c6\u2217 , \u03c6\ne\u2217 ),\n\nwhere \u03c6\u2217 is the pullback of regular functions and \u03c6\ne\u2217 the pullback of characters. If the K-grading\nis pointed, then Aut(X, H) is a linear algebraic group acting morphically on X.\n\nWe will also need details of the construction of the Cox sheaf R on X which we briefly recall\nnow. Denote by c : WDiv(X) \u2192 Cl(X) the map sending the Weil divisors to their classes, let\nPDiv(X) = ker(c) denote the group of principal divisors and choose a character, i.e. a group\nhomomorphism \u03c7 : PDiv(X) \u2192 K(X)\u2217 with\ndiv(\u03c7(E)) = E,\n\nfor all E \u2208 PDiv(X).\n\nThis can be done by prescribing \u03c7 suitably on a Z-basis of PDiv(X). Consider the associated\nsheaf of divisorial algebras\nM\nSD ,\nSD := OX (D).\nS :=\nWDiv(X)\n\nDenote by I the sheaf of ideals of S locally generated by the sections 1 \u2212 \u03c7(E), where 1 is\nhomogeneous of degree zero, E runs through PDiv(X) and \u03c7(E) is homogeneous of degree \u2212E.\nThe Cox sheaf associated to K and \u03c7 is the quotient sheaf R := S/I together with the Cl(X)grading\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nM\nM\nR[D] ,\nR[D] := \u03c0 \uf8ed\nSD\u2032 \uf8f8 .\nR =\nD\u2032 \u2208c\u22121 ([D])\n\n[D]\u2208Cl(X)\n\nwhere \u03c0 : S \u2192 R denotes the projection. The Cox sheaf R is a quasicoherent sheaf of Cl(X)-graded\nOX -algebras. The Cox ring is the ring R(X) of global sections of the Cox sheaf.\n\nProof of Theorem 2.1. We set GX := Aut(X, HX ) for short. According to Corollary 2.3, the\ngroup GX is linear algebraic and acts morphically on X. Looking at the representations of HX\nand GX on \u0393(X, O) = R(X) defined by the respective actions, we see that the canonical inclusion\nHX \u2192 GX is a morphism of linear algebraic groups.\nNext we construct the subset U \u2286 X from the last part of the statement. Consider the translates\nb where g \u2208 G . Each of them admits a good quotient with a complete quotient space:\ng * X,\nX\nb \u2192 (g * X)/\nb /HX .\npX,g : g * X\n\nBy [3], there are only finitely many open subsets of X with such a good quotient. In particular,\nb is finite.\nthe number of translates g * X\nc \u2192 W , where\nLet W \u2286 X denote the maximal open subset such that the restricted quotient W\n\u22121\nc\nW := pX (W ), is geometric, i.e. has the HX -orbits as its fibers. Then, for any g \u2208 GX , the\nc \u2286 g* X\nb is the (unique) maximal open subset which is saturated with respect to the\ntranslate g* W\nquotient map pX,g and defines a geometric quotient.

Consequently, also U\nb is big in X.\nwith respect to pX . By [1, Prop. 6.1.6] the set W\nb\nThus, the (open) set U := pX (U ) is big in X.

Thus, we have\nthere is a unique morphical action of GX on U making pX : U\nhomomorphism of groups\nGX \u2192 Aut(U ) \u2286 Bir2 (X).\nWe show that \u03c0 : GX \u2192 Bir2 (X) is surjective. Consider a weak automorphism \u03c6 : X \u2192 X.\nThe pullback defines an automorphism of the group of Weil divisors\n\u03c6\u2217 : WDiv(X) \u2192 WDiv(X),\n\nD 7\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 D.\n\nAs in the construction of the Cox sheaf, consider the sheaf of divisorial algebras S = \u2295SD associated to WDiv(X) and fix a character \u03c7 : PDiv(X) \u2192 K(X)\u2217 with div(\u03c7(E)) = E for any\nE \u2208 PDiv(X). Then we obtain a homomorphism\n\u03b1 : PDiv(X) \u2192 K\u2217 ,\n\nE 7\u2192\n\n\u03c6\u2217 (\u03c7(E))\n.\n\u03c7(\u03c6\u2217 (E))\n\nWe extend this to a homomorphism \u03b1 : WDiv(X) \u2192 K\u2217 as follows. Write Cl(X) as a direct sum\nof a free part and cyclic groups \u03931 , . . . , \u0393s of order ni . Take D1 , . . . , Dr \u2208 WDiv(X) such that the\nclasses of D1 , . . . , Ds are generators for \u03931 , . . . , \u0393s and the remaining ones define a basis of the\nfree part.

Using \u03b1(E)\nas a \"correction term\", we define an automorphism of the graded sheaf S of divisorial algebras:\nfor any open set V \u2286 X we set\n\u03c6\u2217 : \u0393(V, SD ) \u2192 \u0393(\u03c6\u22121 (V ), S\u03c6\u2217 (D) ),\n\nf 7\u2192 \u03b1(D)f \u25e6 \u03c6.\n\nBy construction \u03c6\u2217 sends the ideal I arising from the character \u03c7 to itself. Consequently, \u03c6\u2217\ndescends to an automorphism (\u03c8, F ) of the (graded) Cox sheaf R; note that F is the pullback of\ndivisor classes via \u03c6. The degree zero part of \u03c8 equals the usual pullback of regular functions on\nb \u2192U\nb maps to \u03c6.\nX via \u03c6. Thus, the element in Aut(X, HX ) defined by Spec \u03c8 : U\nClearly, HX lies in the kernel of \u03c0 : GX \u2192 Bir2 (X). For the reverse inclusion, consider an\nelement g \u2208 ker(\u03c0). Then g is a pair (\u03c6, \u03c6)\ne and, by the construction of \u03c0, we have a commutative\ndiagram\nb\nU\n\n\u03c6\n\npX\n\n\u000f\nU\n\nb\n/U\n\npX\n\nid\n\n\u000f\n/U\n\nb , O) =\nIn particular, \u03c6 stabilizes all HX -invariant divisors. It follows that the pullback \u03c6\u2217 on \u0393(U\nR(X) stabilizes the homogeneous components. Thus, for any homogeneous f of degree w, we\nhave \u03c6\u2217 (f ) = \u03bb(w)f with a homomorphism \u03bb : K \u2192 K\u2217 . Consequently \u03c6(x) = h*x holds with an\nelement h \u2208 HX .

The automorphism group Aut(X) of a Mori dream space X is linear algebraic\nand acts morphically on X.\n\nCorollary 2.5. If two Mori dream spaces are isomorphic in codimension one, then the unit\ncomponents of their automorphism groups are isomorphic to each other.\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n7\n\nLet CAut(X, HX ) denote the centralizer of HX in the automorphism group Aut(X).

Moreover, for any \u03c6 \u2208\nAut(X)0 , the pullback \u03c6\u2217 : Cl(X) \u2192 Cl(X) is the identity. Consequently, \u03c6 lifts to an element of\n\u0003\nCAut(X, HX ). Exactness of the sequence thus follows by dimension reasons.\nCorollary 2.7. Let X be a Mori dream space. Then, for any closed subgroup F \u2286 Aut(X)0 , there\nis a closed subgroup F \u2032 \u2286 CAut(X, HX )0 such that the induced map F \u2032 \u2192 F is an epimorphism\nwith finite kernel.\nCorollary 2.8. Let X be a Mori dream space such that the group CAut(X, HX ) is connected, e.g.\na toric variety. Then there is an exact sequence of linear algebraic groups\n1\n\n/ HX\n\n/ CAut(X, HX )\n\n/ Aut(X)0\n\n/ 1.\n\nExample 2.9. Consider the nondegenerate quadric X in the projective space Pn+1 , where n \u2265 4\nis even. Then the Cox ring of X is the Z-graded ring\n2\nR(X) = K[T0 , . . . , Tn+1 ] / hT02 + . . . + Tn+1\ni,\n\ndeg(T0 ) = . . . = deg(Tn+1 ) = 1.\n\nThe characteristic quasitorus is HX = K\u2217 . Moreover, for the equivariant automorphisms and the\ncentralizer of HX we obtain\nAut(X, HX ) = CAut(X, HX ) = K\u2217 En+2 *On+2 .\nThus, CAut(X, HX ) has two connected components. Note that for n = 4, the quadric X comes\nwith a torus action of complexity one.\n3. Rings with a factorial grading of complexity one\nHere we recall the necessary constructions and results on factorially graded rings of complexity\none and Cox rings of varieties with a torus action of complexity one from [13]. The main result\nof this section is Proposition 3.5 which describes the dimension of the homogeneous components\nin terms of the (common) degree of the relations. As before, we work over an algebraically closed\nfield K of characteristic zero.\nLet K be an abelian group and R = \u2295K Rw a K-graded algebra. The grading is called effective\nif the weight monoid S of R generates K as a group. Moreover, we say that the grading is of\ncomplexity one, if it is effective and dim(KQ ) equals dim(R) \u2212 1. By a K-prime element of R we\nmean a homogeneous nonzero nonunit f \u2208 R such that f | gh with homogeneous g, h \u2208 R implies\nf | g or f | h.

The assertion follows.\n\u0003\nThe following observation shows that the common degree \u03bc = deg(gI ) of the relations generalizes\nthe \"remarkable weight\" introduced by Panyushev [22] in the factorial case. Recall that the weight\nmonoid S0 \u2286 K0 consists of all w \u2208 K0 admitting a nonzero homogeneous element.\nProposition 3.5. Consider the K0 -graded ring R := R(A, P0 ) and the degree \u03bc = deg(gI ) of the\nrelations as defined in 3.1. For w \u2208 S0 let sw \u2208 Z\u22650 be the unique number with w \u2212 sw \u03bc \u2208 S0 and\nw \u2212 (sw + 1)\u03bc 6\u2208 S0 . Then we have\ndim(Rw ) = sw + 1 for all w \u2208 S0 .\nThe element \u03bc \u2208 K0 is uniquely determined by this property. We have dim(R\u03bc ) = 2 and any two\nnonproportional elements in R\u03bc are coprime. Moreover, any w \u2208 S0 with w \u2212 \u03bc 6\u2208 S0 satisfies\ndim(Rw ) = 1.\nProof. According to Proposition 3.4, the field Q(R)0 of degree zero fractions is the field of rational\nfunctions in p1 /p0 , where p0 := T0l0 and p1 := T1l1 are coprime and of degree \u03bc. Moreover, by the\nstructure of the relations gI , we have dim(R\u03bc ) = 2.\nNow, consider w \u2208 S0 . If we have dim(Rw ) = 1, then dim(R\u03bc ) = 2 implies sw = 0 and the\nassertion follows in this case. Suppose that we have dim(Rw ) > 1. Then we find two nonproportional elements f0 , f1 \u2208 Rw and two coprime homogeneous polynomials F0 , F1 of a common\ndegree s > 0 such that\nF1 (p0 , p1 )\nf1\n=\n.\nf0\nF0 (p0 , p1 )\nObserve that F1 (p0 , p1 ) must divide f1 . This implies w \u2212 s\u03bc \u2208 S0 . Repeating the procedure with\nw \u2212 s\u03bc and so on, we finally arrive at a weight w\ne = w \u2212 sw \u03bc with dim(Rwe ) = 1. Moreover, by\nthe procedure, any element of Rw is of the form hF (p0 , p1 ) with 0 6= h \u2208 Rwe and a homogeneous\npolynomial F of degree sw . The assertion follows.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.6.

We define a K-grading on K[Tij , Sk ] by setting\ndeg(Tij ) := Q(eij ),\n\ndeg(Sk ) := Q(ek ).\n\nThe trinomials gI of 3.1 are K-homogeneous, all of the same degree. In particular, we obtain a\nK-graded factor ring\nR(A, P )\n\n:= K[Tij , Sk ; 0 \u2264 i \u2264 r, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 ni , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m] / hgI ; I \u2208 Ii.\n\nTheorem 3.8. See [13, Theorem 1.4]. With the notation of Construction 3.7, the following\nstatements hold.\n(i) The K-grading of the ring R(A, P ) is factorial, pointed and almost free, i.e. K is generated\nby any n + m \u2212 1 of the deg(Tij ), deg(Sk ).\n(ii) The variables Tij and Sk define a system of pairwise nonassociated K-prime generators\nof R(A, P ).\nRemark 3.9. As rings R(A, P0 ) and R(A, P ) coincide but the K0 -grading is finer than the Kgrading.

Note that for the quasitori T , H0 and H associated to abelian\ngroups Zs , K0 and K we have T = H0 /H.\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n11\n\nConstruction 3.10. Consider a ring R(A, P ) with its K-grading and the finer K0 -grading. Then\nb \u2286 X be a\nthe quasitori H = Spec K[K] and H0 := Spec K[K0 ] act on X := Spec R(A, P ). Let X\nbig H0 -invariant open subset with a good quotient\nb \u2192 X = X/\nb /H\np: X\n\nsuch that X is complete and for some open set U \u2286 X, the inverse image p\u22121 (U ) \u2286 X is big and\nH acts freely on U . Then X is a Mori dream space of dimension s + 1 with divisor class group\nCl(X) \u223c\n= K and Cox ring R(X) \u223c\n= R(A, P ). Moreover, X comes with an induced effective action\nof the s-dimensional torus T := H0 /H.\nRemark 3.11. Let X be a T -variety arising from data A and P via Construction 3.10. Then\nevery Tij \u2208 R(A, P ) defines an invariant prime divisor Dij = T *xij in X such that the isotropy\ngroup Txij is cyclic of order lij and the class of dij \u2208 Zs in (Z/lij Z)s is the weight vector of the\ntangent presentation of Txij at xxij . Moreover, each Sk defines an invariant prime divisor Ek \u2286 X\nsuch that the one-parameter subgroup K\u2217 \u2192 T corresponding to d\u2032k \u2286 Zs acts trivially on Ek .\nTheorem 3.12. Let X be an n-dimensional complete normal rational variety with an effective\naction of an (n \u2212 1)-dimensional torus S. Then X is equivariantly isomorphic to a T -variety\narising from data (A, P ) as in 3.10.\nProof. We may assume that X is not a toric variety. According to [13, Theorem 1.5], the Cl(X)graded Cox ring of X is isomorphic to a K-graded ring R(A, P ). Thus, in the notation of 3.10,\nb /H. Applying [24, Cor. 2.3] to a\nb of X with X \u223c\nthere is a big H-invariant open subset X\n= X/\nb\nsubtorus T0 \u2286 H0 projecting onto T = H0 /H, we see that X is even invariant under H0 . Thus, T\nacts on X. Since the T -action is conjugate in Aut(X) to the given S-action on X, the assertion\nfollows.\n\u0003\nExample 3.13 (The E6 -singular cubic II).

Primitive locally nilpotent derivations\nHere, we investigate the homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations of the K0 -graded algebra\nR(A, P0 ). The description of the \"primitive\" ones given in Theorem 4.3 is the central algebraic tool\nfor our study of automorphism groups. As before, K is an algebraically closed field of characteristic\nzero.\nLet us briefly recall the necessary background. We consider derivations on an integral K-algebra\nR, that means K-linear maps \u03b4 : R \u2192 R satisfying the Leibniz rule\n\u03b4(f g) = \u03b4(f )g + f \u03b4(g).\n\n\f12\n\nI. ARZHANTSEV, J. HAUSEN, E. HERPPICH, AND A. LIENDO\n\nAny such \u03b4 : R \u2192 R extends uniquely to a derivation \u03b4 : Q(R) \u2192 Q(R) of the quotient field. Recall\nthat a derivation \u03b4 : R \u2192 R is said to be locally nilpotent if for every f \u2208 R there is an n \u2208 N with\n\u03b4 n (f ) = 0. Now suppose that R is graded by a finitely generated abelian group:\nM\nR =\nRw .\nw\u2208K\n\nA derivation \u03b4 : R \u2192 R is called homogeneous if for every w \u2208 K there is a w\u2032 \u2208 K with\n\u03b4(Rw ) \u2286 Rw\u2032 . Any homogeneous derivation \u03b4 : R \u2192 R has a degree deg(\u03b4) \u2208 K satisfying\n\u03b4(Rw ) \u2286 Rw+deg(\u03b4) for all w \u2208 K.\nDefinition 4.1. Let K be a finitely generated abelian group, R = \u2295K Rw a K-graded K-algebra\nand Q(R)0 \u2286 Q(R) the subfield of all fractions f /g of homogeneous elements f, g \u2208 R with\ndeg(f ) = deg(g).\n(i) We call a homogeneous derivation \u03b4 : R \u2192 R primitive if deg(\u03b4) does not lie in the weight\ncone \u03c9 \u2286 KQ of R.\n(ii) We say that a homogeneous derivation \u03b4 : R \u2192 R is of vertical type if \u03b4(Q(R)0 ) = 0 holds\nand of horizontal type otherwise.\nConstruction 4.2. Notation as in Construction 3.1. We define derivations of the K0 -graded\nalgebra R(A, P0 ) constructed there. The input data are\n\u2022 a sequence C = (c0 , . . . , cr ) with 1 \u2264 ci \u2264 ni ,\n\u2022 a vector \u03b2 \u2208 Kr+1 lying in the row space of the matrix [a0 , . . . , ar ].\nNote that for 0 6= \u03b2 as above either all entries differ from zero or there is a unique i0 with \u03b2i0 = 0.\nAccording to these cases, we put further conditions and define:\n(i) if all entries \u03b20 , . . . , \u03b2r differ from zero and there is at most one i1 with li1 ci1 > 1, then\nwe set\n\uf8f1\nl\n\u2202Tkk\n\uf8f2 Q\n,\nj = ci ,\n\u03b2i k6=i \u2202Tkc\n\u03b4C,\u03b2 (Tij ) :=\nk\n\uf8f30,\nj 6= ci ,\n\u03b4C,\u03b2 (Sk ) :=\n\n0 for k = 1, . . . , m,\n\n(ii) if \u03b2i0 = 0 is the unique zero entry of \u03b2 and there is at most one i1 with i1 6= i0 and\nli1 ci1 > 1, then we set\n\uf8f1\nl\n\u2202Tkk\n\uf8f2 Q\n\u03b2i k6=i,i0 \u2202Tkc\n,\nj = ci ,\n\u03b4C,\u03b2 (Tij ) :=\nk\n\uf8f30,\nj=\n6 ci ,\n\u03b4C,\u03b2 (Sk ) :=\n\n0 for k = 1, . . . , m.\n\nThese assignments define K0 -homogeneous primitive locally nilpotent derivations \u03b4C,\u03b2 : R(A, P0 ) \u2192\nR(A, P0 ) of degree\n(\nP\nr\u03bc \u2212 k deg(Tkck ),\nin case (i),\ndeg(\u03b4C,\u03b2 ) =\nP\nin case (ii).\n(r \u2212 1)\u03bc \u2212 k6=i0 deg(Tkck ),\nProof. The assignments (i) and (ii) on the variables define a priori derivations of the polynomial\nring K[Tij , Sk ]. Recall from 3.1 that R(A, P0 ) is the quotient of K[Tij , Sk ] by the ideal generated\nby all\n\u0014 li\nli\nli \u0015\n1\nTi2 2 Ti3 3 ,\ngI = det Ti1\nai3\nai2\nai1\nwhere I = (i1 , i2 , i3 ). Since the vector \u03b2 lies in the row space of [a0 , . . . , ar ], we see that \u03b4C,\u03b2 sends\nevery trinomial gI to zero and thus descends to a well defined derivation of R(A, P0 ).\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n13\n\nWe check that \u03b4C,\u03b2 is homogeneous. Obviously, every \u03b4C,\u03b2 (Tij ) is a K0 -homogeneous element\nof K[Tij ]. Moreover, with the degree \u03bc of the relations gI , we have\n(\nP\nin case (i),\nr\u03bc \u2212 k deg(Tkck ),\ndeg(\u03b4C,\u03b2 (Tij )) \u2212 deg(Tij ) =\nP\nin case (ii).\n(r \u2212 1)\u03bc \u2212 k6=i0 deg(Tkck ),\n\nIn particular, the left hand side does not depend on (i, j). We conclude that \u03b4C,\u03b2 is homogeneous\nof degree deg(\u03b4C,\u03b2 (Tij )) \u2212 deg(Tij ).\nFor primitivity, we have to show that the degree of \u03b4C,\u03b2 does not lie in the weight cone of\nR(A, P0 ). We exemplarily treat case (i), where we may assume that i1 = 0 holds. As seen before,\nthe degree of \u03b4C,\u03b2 is represented by the vector\nX\nX\nlrj erj \u2208 Zn+m .\nl1j e1j + . . . +\nvC,\u03b2 := \u2212e0c0 +\nj6=c1\n\nj6=cr\n\nn+m\n\nThus, we look for a linear form on Q\nseparating this vector from the orthant cone(eij , ek ) and\nvanishing along the kernel of Qn+m \u2192 (K0 )Q , i.e. the linear subspace spanned by the columns of\nP0\u2217 . For example, we may take\n\u22121 \u2217\n\u22121 \u2217\n\u22121 \u2217\ne .\ne + . . . + lrc\ne + l1c\nl0c\nr rcr\n1 1c1\n0 0c0\n\nFinally, we show that \u03b4C,\u03b2 is locally nilpotent. If lici = 1 holds for all i, then \u03b4C,\u03b2 (Tij ) is a\n2\nproduct of variables from the kernel of \u03b4C,\u03b2 and thus \u03b4C,\u03b2\nannihilates all generators. If l0c0 > 1\nholds, then we have\n2\n\u03b4C,\u03b2\n(T0c0 ) = 0,\n\nl\n\n\u03b4C,\u03b2 (Tici ) = T0c0c00\n\n\u22121\n\nhi ,\nl0c +1\n\nwhere i \u2265 1 and hi lies in the kernel of \u03b4C,\u03b2 . Putting all together, we obtain that \u03b4C,\u03b20\nall generators Tij and thus \u03b4C,\u03b2 is locally nilpotent.\n\nannihilates\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 4.3. Let \u03b4 : R(A, P0 ) \u2192 R(A, P0 ) be a nontrivial primitive K0 -homogeneous locally\nnilpotent derivation.\n(i) If \u03b4 is of vertical type, then \u03b4(Tij ) = 0 holds for all i, j and there is a k0 such that \u03b4(Sk0 )\ndoes not depend on Sk0 and \u03b4(Sk ) = 0 holds for all k 6= k0 .\n(ii) If \u03b4 is of horizontal type, then we have \u03b4 = h\u03b4C,\u03b2 , where \u03b4C,\u03b2 is as in 4.2 and h is\nK0 -homogeneous with h \u2208 ker(\u03b4C,\u03b2 ).\nIn the proof of this theorem we will make frequently use of the following facts; the statements\nof the first Lemma occur in Freudenburg's book, see [8, Principles 1, 5 and 7, Corollary 1.20].\nLemma 4.4. Let R be an integral K-algebra, \u03b4 : R \u2192 R a locally nilpotent derivation and let\nf, g \u2208 R.\n(i) If f g \u2208 ker(\u03b4) holds, then f, g \u2208 ker(\u03b4) holds.\n(ii) If \u03b4(f ) = f g holds, then \u03b4(f ) = 0 holds.\n(iii) The derivation f \u03b4 is locally nilpotent if and only if f \u2208 ker(\u03b4) holds.\n(iv) If g | \u03b4(f ) and f | \u03b4(g), then \u03b4(f ) = 0 or \u03b4(g) = 0.\nLemma 4.5. Let \u03b4 : R(A, P0 ) \u2192 R(A, P0 ) be a primitive K0 -homogeneous derivation induced by\nb I ) = 0 holds for all relations\na K0 -homogeneous derivation \u03b4b: K[Tij , Sk ] \u2192 K[Tij , Sk ]. Then \u03b4(g\ngI .\n\nb \u2286 a for the ideal a \u2286 K[Tij , Sk ] generated by the gI . Recall that all\nProof. Clearly, we have \u03b4(a)\nb is not in the weight cone. Thus,\ngI are of the same degree \u03bc. By primitivity, deg(\u03b4) = deg(\u03b4)\nb\nK[Tij ]\u03bc+deg(\u03b4)\n\u0003\nb \u2229 a = {0} holds. This implies \u03b4(gI ) = 0.\n\nProof of Theorem 4.3. Suppose that \u03b4 is of vertical type. Then \u03b4(Tili /Tsls ) = 0 holds for any two\n0 \u2264 i < s \u2264 r. By the Leibniz rule, this implies\n\u03b4(Tili )Tsls\n\n= Tili \u03b4(Tsls ).\n\n\f14\n\nI. ARZHANTSEV, J. HAUSEN, E. HERPPICH, AND A. LIENDO\n\nWe conclude that Tili divides \u03b4(Tili ) and Tsls divides \u03b4(Tsls ). By Lemma 4.4 (ii), this implies\n\u03b4(Tili ) = \u03b4(Tsls ) = 0. Using Lemma 4.4 (i), we obtain \u03b4(Tij ) = 0 for all variables Tij . Since \u03b4 is\nnontrivial, we should have \u03b4(Sk0 ) 6= 0 at least for one k0 . Consider the basis ek = deg(Sk ) of Zm ,\nwhere k = 1, . . . , m, and write\ndeg(\u03b4) = w\u2032 +\n\nm\nX\n\nbk ek ,\n\nwhere\n\nw \u2032 \u2208 K0\n\nand bk \u2208 Z.\n\nk=1\n\nP\nThen deg(\u03b4(Sk0 )) = w\u2032 + k6=k0 bk ek + (bk0 + 1)ek0 . By Lemma 4.4, the variable Sk0 does not\ndivide \u03b4(Sk0 ). This and the condition \u03b4(Sk0 ) 6= 0 imply bk0 = \u22121 and bk \u2265 0 for k 6= k0 . This\nproves that \u03b4(Sk ) = 0 for all k 6= k0 and \u03b4(Sk0 ) is K0 -homogeneous and does not depend on Sk0 .\nNow suppose that \u03b4 is of horizontal type. Then there exists a variable Tij with \u03b4(Tij ) 6= 0.\nWrite\nm\nX\n\u2032\ndeg(\u03b4(Tij )) = deg(Tij ) + w +\nbk ek .\nk=1\n\nThen all coefficients bk are nonnegative and consequently we obtain \u03b4(Sk ) = 0 for k = 1, . . . , m.\nWe show that for any Tili there is at most one variable Tij with \u03b4(Tij ) 6= 0. Assume that we\nfind two different j, k with \u03b4(Tij ) 6= 0 and \u03b4(Tik ) 6= 0. Note that we have\n\u2202Tili\n\u2202Tili\n\u03b4(Tij ),\n\u03b4(Tik )\n\u2202Tij\n\u2202Tik\n\n\u2208\n\nR(A, P0 )\u03bc+deg(\u03b4) .\n\nBy Proposition 3.5, the component of degree \u03bc + deg(\u03b4) is of dimension one. Thus, the above two\nlik\nterms differ by a nonzero scalar and we see that Tik\ndivides the second term. Consequently, Tik\nmust divide \u03b4(Tik ) which contradicts 4.4 (ii).\nA second step is to see that for any two variables Tij and Tks with \u03b4(Tij ) 6= 0 and \u03b4(Tks ) 6=\n0 we must have lij = 1 or lks = 1. Otherwise, we see as before that \u2202Tili /\u2202Tij \u03b4(Tij ) and\n\u2202Tklk /\u2202Tks \u03b4(Tks ) differ by a nonzero scalar. Thus, we conclude \u03b4(Tij ) = f Tks and \u03b4(Tks ) = hTij ,\na contradiction to 4.4 (iv).\nFinally, we prove the assertion. As already seen, for every 0 \u2264 k \u2264 r there is at most one ck with\n\u03b4(Tkck ) 6= 0. Let K \u2286 {0, . . . , r} denote the set of all k admitting such a ck . From Proposition 3.5\nwe infer R(A, P )\u03bc+deg(\u03b4) = Kf with some nonzero element f . We claim that\nf = h\n\nY \u2202T lk\nk\n,\n\u2202Tkck\n\n\u03b4(Tici ) = \u03b2i h\n\nk\u2208K\n\nY\n\nk\u2208K\\{i}\n\n\u2202Tklk\n,\n\u2202Tkck\n\nhold with a homogeneous element h \u2208 R(A, P ) and scalars \u03b20 , . . . , \u03b2r \u2208 K. Indeed, similar to the\nprevious arguments, the first equation follows from fact that all \u2202Tklk /\u2202Tkck \u03b4(Tkck ) are nonzero\nelements of the same degree as f and hence each \u2202Tklk /\u2202Tkck must divide f . The second equation\nis clear then.\nThe vector \u03b2 := (\u03b20 , . . . , \u03b2r ) lies in the row space of the matrix A. To see this, consider the lift\nof \u03b4 to K[Tij , Sk ] defined by the second equation and apply Lemma 4.5. Now let C = (c0 , . . . , cr )\nbe any sequence completing the ck , where k \u2208 K. Then we have \u03b4 = h\u03b4C,\u03b2 . The fact that h\nbelongs to the kernel of \u03b4C,\u03b2 follows from Lemma 4.4.\n\u0003\nExample 4.6 (The E6 -singular cubic III). Situation as in 3.3.

In particular, there are only finitely many\nDemazure P -roots. For computing them explicitly, the following presentation is helpful.\nRemark 5.4. The Demazure P -roots are the lattice points of certain polytopes in MQ .

One considers the adjoint representation of the torus T\non the Lie algebra Lie(G), i.e. the tangent representation at eG of the T -action on G given by\nconjugation (t, g) 7\u2192 tgt\u22121 . There is a unique T -invariant splitting Lie(G) = Lie(T ) \u2295 n, where n\nis spanned by nilpotent vectors, and one has a bijection\n1-PASGT (G) \u2192 {T -eigenvectors of n},\n\n\u03bb 7\u2192 \u03bb\u0307(0).\n\nHere 1-PASGT (G) denotes the set of one parameter additive subgroups \u03bb : Ga \u2192 G normalized\nby T and \u03bb\u0307 denotes the differential. A root of G with respect to T is an eigenvalue of the T representation on n, that means a character \u03c7 \u2208 X(T ) with t * v = \u03c7(t)v for some T -eigenvector\n0 6= v \u2208 n.\nTheorem 5.5. Let A, P be as in Construction 3.7 such that R(A, P ) is minimally presented and\nlet X be a (nontoric) variety with a complexity one torus action T \u00d7 X \u2192 X arising from A, P\naccording to Construction 3.10.\n(i) The automorphism group Aut(X) is a linear algebraic group with maximal torus T .\n(ii) Under the canonical identification X(T ) = Zs , the roots of Aut(X) with respect to T are\nprecisely the P -roots.\nThe rest of the section is devoted to the proof. We will have to deal with the K0 - and K-degrees\nof functions and derivations. It might be helpful to recall the relations between the gradings from\nRemark 3.9. The following simple facts will be frequently used.\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n17\n\nLemma 5.6. In the setting of Constructions 3.1 and 3.7, consider the polynomial ring K[Tij , Sk ]\nwith the K0 -grading and the coarser K-grading.\nQ eij Q ek\n(i) For a monomial h =\nTij\nSk with exponent vector e = (eij , ek ), the K0 - and Kdegrees are given as\ndegK0 (h) = Q0 (e),\n(ii) A monomial h \u2208\n\nK[Tij\u00b11, Sk\u00b11 ]\n\nh = hu :=\n\nY\n\ndegK (h) = Q(e).\n\nis of K-degree zero if and only if there is an u \u2208 M with\nY P \u2217 (u)\nY hu,v i Y hu,v i\nP \u2217 (u)ij\nk\nTij\nSk\n=\nTij ij\nSk k .\n\n(iii) Let \u03b4 be a derivation on K[Tij , Sk ] sending the generators Tij , Sk to monomials. Then \u03b4\nis K-homogeneous of K-degree zero if and only if\ndegK (Tij\u22121 \u03b4(Tij )) = degK (Sk\u22121 \u03b4(Sk )) = 0 holds for all i, j, k.\nIf 0 6= \u03b4 is K0 -homogeneous, then degK (\u03b4) = 0 holds if and only if one of the Tij\u22121 \u03b4(Tij )\nand Sk\u22121 \u03b4(Sk ) is nontrivial of K-degree zero.\nAs a first step towards the roots of the automorphism group Aut(X), we now associate K0 homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations of R(A, P ) to the Demazure P -roots.\nConstruction 5.7. Let A and P be as in Construction 3.7. For u \u2208 M and the lattice vector\n\u03b6 \u2208 Zn+m of Remark 5.4 consider the monomials\nY hu,v i Y hu,v i\nY \u03b6 Y \u03b6\nhu =\nTij ij\nSk k ,\nh\u03b6 :=\nTijij\nSkk .\ni,j\n\ni,j\n\nk\n\nk\n\nWe associate to any Demazure P -root \u03ba a locally nilpotent derivation \u03b4\u03ba of R(A, P ). If \u03ba = (u, k0 )\nis vertical, then we define a \u03b4\u03ba of vertical type by\n(\nSk0 hu , k = k0 ,\n\u03b4\u03ba (Tij ) := 0 for all i, j,\n\u03b4\u03ba (Sk ) :=\n0,\nk 6= k0 .\nIf \u03ba = (u, i0 , i1 , C) is horizontal, then there is a unique vector \u03b2 in the row space of A with \u03b2i0 = 0,\n\u03b2i1 = 1 and we define a \u03b4\u03ba of horizonal type by\nhu\n\u03b4C,\u03b2 .\nh\u03b6\nis K0 -homogeneous; its K0 -degree is the Zs -part of \u03ba and the\n\u03b4\u03ba\n\n:=\n\nIn all cases, the derivation \u03b4\u03ba\nK-degree is zero:\ndegK0 (\u03b4\u03ba ) = Q0 (P \u2217 (u)),\n\ndegK (\u03b4\u03ba ) = 0.\n\nProof. In the vertical case \u03b4\u03ba (Sk0 ) does not depend on Sk0 and in the horizontal case the factors\nbefore \u03b4C,\u03b2 in the definitions of \u03b4\u03ba are contained in ker(\u03b4C,\u03b2 ). Thus, the derivations \u03b4\u03ba are locally\nnilpotent. Clearly, the \u03b4\u03ba are K0 -homogeneous. By Lemma 5.6, the monomial hu is of K0 -degree\nQ0 (P \u2217 (u)). In the vertical case, this implies directly that \u03b4\u03ba is of K0 -degree Q0 (P \u2217 (u)). In the\nhorizontal case, we use Lemma 5.6 and the degree computation of Construction 4.2 to see that\nh\u03b6 and \u03b4C,\u03b2 have the same K0 -degree. Thus \u03b4\u03ba is of K0 -degree Q0 (P \u2217 (u)). Since P \u2217 (u) \u2208 ker(Q)\nholds, we obtain that all \u03b4\u03ba are of K-degree Q(P \u2217 (u)) = 0.\n\u0003\nProposition 5.8. Consider a minimally presented algebra R(A, P ) with its fine K0 -grading and\nthe coarser K-grading and let \u03b4 be a K0 -homogeneous locally nilpotent derivation of K-degree zero\non R(A, P ).\n(i) If \u03b4 is of vertical type, then there is an index 1 \u2264 k0 \u2264 m such that \u03b4 is a linear\ncombination of derivations \u03b4\u03bat with Demazure P -roots \u03bat = (ut , k0 ).\n(ii) If \u03b4 is of horizontal type, then are indices 0 \u2264 i0 , i1 \u2264 r and a sequence C = (c0 , . . . , cr )\nsuch that \u03b4 is a linear combination of derivations \u03b4\u03bat with Demazure P -roots \u03bat =\n(ut , i0 , i1 , C).\n\n\f18\n\nI. ARZHANTSEV, J. HAUSEN, E. HERPPICH, AND A. LIENDO\n\nLemma 5.9. Let \u03b4 be a nontrivial K0 -homogeneous locally nilpotent derivation on a minimally\npresented algebra R(A, P ) and let r \u2265 2. If \u03b4 is of K-degree zero, then \u03b4 is primitive with respect\nto the K0 -grading.\nProof. We have to show that the K0 -degree w of \u03b4 does not lie in the weight cone of the K0 grading. First observe that w 6= 0 holds: otherwise Corollary 3.6 yields that \u03b4 annihilates all\ngenerators Tij and Sk , a contradiction to \u03b4 6= 0. Now assume that w lies in the weight cone of the\nK0 -grading. Then, for some d > 0, we find a nonzero f \u2208 R(A, P )dw . The K-degree of f equals\nzero and thus f is constant, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition 5.8. First assume that \u03b4 is vertical. Lemma 5.9 tells us that \u03b4 is primitive\nwith respect to the K0 -grading. According to Theorem 4.3, there is an index 1 \u2264 k0 \u2264 m and an\nelement h \u2208 R(A, P ) represented by a polynomial only depending on variables from ker(\u03b4) such\nthat we have\n\u03b4(Tij ) = 0 for all i, j,\n\n\u03b4(Sk ) = 0 for all k 6= k0 ,\n\n\u03b4(Sk0 ) = h.\n\nis K0 -homogeneous of K-degree zero. Lemma 5.6 shows that the monomials of hSk\u22121\nClearly,\n0\nu\nand\ndo\nnot\ndepend\non\nS\nwith\nu\n\u2208\nM\n.\nThe\nfacts\nthat\nthe\nmonomials\nh\nS\nare of the form hu Sk\u22121\nk\nk\n0\n0\n0\nhave nonnegative exponents yield the inequalities of a vertical Demazure P -root for each (u, k0 ).\nConsequently, \u03b4 is a linear combination of deriviations arising from vertical Demazure P -roots.\nWe turn to the case that \u03b4 is horizontal. Again by Lemma 5.9, our \u03b4 is primitive with respect to\nthe K0 -grading and by Theorem 4.3 it has the form h\u03b4C,\u03b2 for some K0 -homogeneous h \u2208 ker(\u03b4C,\u03b2 ).\nBy construction, \u03b4C,\u03b2 is induced by a homogeneous derivation of K[Tij , Sk ] having the same K0 and K-degrees; we denote this lifted derivation again by \u03b4C,\u03b2 . Similarly, h is represented by a\npolynomial in K[Tij , Sk ] which we again denote by h.\nWe show that any monomial of h depends only on variables from ker(\u03b4C,\u03b2 ). Indeed, suppose\nthat there occurs a monomial Tij h\u2032 with \u03b4C,\u03b2 (Tij ) 6= 0 in h. Then, using the fact that \u03b4 is of\nK-degree zero, we obtain\nhSk\u22121\n0\n\ndeg(Tij ) = deg(\u03b4(Tij )) = deg(Tij ) + deg(h\u2032 ) + deg(\u03b4C,\u03b2 (Tij )).\nThis implies deg(h\u2032 ) + deg(\u03b4C,\u03b2 (Tij )) = 0; a contradiction to the fact that the weight cone of the\nK-grading contains no lines. This proves the claim. Thus, we may assume that the polynomial h\nis a monomial.\nThe next step is to see that it is sufficient to take derivations \u03b4C,\u03b2 with a vector \u03b2 in the row\nspace having one zero coordinate. Consider a general \u03b2, that means one with only nonvanishing\ncoordinates. By construction, the row space of A contains unique vectors \u03b2 0 and \u03b2 1 with \u03b200 =\n\u03b211 = 0 and \u03b2 = \u03b2 0 + \u03b2 1 . With these vectors, we have\nh\u03b4C,\u03b2\n\n= h\n\n\u2202T l1\n\u2202T0l0\n\u03b4C,\u03b2 0 + h 1 \u03b4C,\u03b2 1 .\n\u2202T0c0\n\u2202T1c1\n\nBy Construction 4.2, the K0 -degrees and thus the K-degrees of the left hand side and of the summands coincide. Moreover, h is a monomial in generators from ker(\u03b4C,\u03b2 ) and any such generator\nis annihilated by \u03b4C,\u03b2 0 and by \u03b4C,\u03b2 1 too.\nLet e = (eij , ek ) denote the exponent vector of the monomial h. According to Lemma 5.6, the\ncondition that the (K0 -homogeneous) derivation \u03b4 has K-degree zero is equivalent to the fact that\nthe monomial\nY e Y\nY \u2202T li\nei0 ci\nij\nek\n\u22121\ni\n0\nT\nT\n)\n=\nT\nh\u03b4\n(T\nTi\u22121\nS\n\u03b2\nC,\u03b2\ni1 ci1\ni1\nij\ni1 ci1 i0 ci0\nk\n1 ci1\n\u2202T\nic\ni\ni\nj6=ci\n\nk\n\ni6=i0 ,i1\n\nhas the form hu for some linear form u \u2208 M . Taking into account that the exponents eij and ek\nare nonnegative, we see that these conditions are equivalent to equalities and inequalities in the\ndefinition of a horizontal Demazure P -root.\n\u0003\nWe recall the correspondence between locally nilpotent derivations and one parameter additive\nsubgroups. Consider any integral affine K-algebra R, where K is an algebraically closed field of\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n19\n\ncharacteristic zero. Every locally nilpotent derivation \u03b4 : R \u2192 R gives rise to a rational representation \u033a\u03b4 : Ga \u2192 Aut(R) of the additive group Ga of the field K via\n\u033a\u03b4 (t)(f ) := exp(t\u03b4)(f ) :=\n\n\u221e d\nX\nt\nd=0\n\nd!\n\n\u03b4 d (f ).\n\nThis sets up a bijection between the locally nilpotent derivations of R and the rational representations of Ga by automorphisms of R. The representation associated to a locally nilpotent derivation\n\u03b4 : R \u2192 R gives rise to a one parameter additive subgroup (1-PASG) of the automorphism group\nof X := Spec R:\nt 7\u2192 Spec(\u033a\u03b4 (t)).\n\u03bb\u03b4 : Ga \u2192 Aut(X),\nNow suppose that R is graded by some finitely generated abelian group K0 and consider the\nassociated action of H0 := Spec K[K0 ] on X = Spec R. We relate homogeneity of locally nilpotent\nderivation \u03b4 to properties of the associated subgroup U \u03b4 := \u03bb\u03b4 (Ga ) of Aut(X).\nLemma 5.10. In the above setting, let \u03b4 be a locally nilpotent derivation on R. The following\nstatements are equivalent.\n(i) The derivation \u03b4 is K0 -homogeneous.\n(ii) One has hU \u03b4 h\u22121 = U \u03b4 for all h \u2208 H0 .\nMoreover, if one of these two statements holds, then the degree w := deg(\u03b4) \u2208 K0 is uniquely\ndetermined by the property\nh\u033a\u03b4 (t)h\u22121 = \u033a\u03b4 (\u03c7w (h)t) for all h \u2208 H0 .\nProof of Theorem 5.5.

The latter is equivalent to\nsaying that \u03bb\u03ba (Ga ) acts trivially (non-trivially) on the field of T -invariant rational functions. \u0003\nExample 5.12 (The E6 -singular cubic V). Let A and P as in Example 5.3. From there we infer\nthat R(A, P ) admits precisely one horizontal Demazure P -root. For the automorphism group\nof the corresponding surface X this means that Aut(X)0 is the semidirect product of K\u2217 and\nGa twisted via the weight 3, see again 5.3. In particular, the surface X is almost homogeneous.\nMoreover, in this case, one can show directly that the group of graded automorphisms of R(A, P )\nis connected. Thus, Theorem 2.1 yields that Aut(X) is the semidirect product of K\u2217 and Ga . This\nis in accordance with [23]; we would like to thank Antonio Laface for mentioning this reference to\nus.\n6. Almost homogeneous surfaces\nA variety is almost homogeneous if its automorphism group acts with an open orbit. We take\na closer look to this case with a special emphasis on almost homogeneous rational K\u2217 -surfaces of\nPicard number one. The first statement characterizes the almost homogeneous varieties coming\nwith a torus action of complexity one in arbitrary dimension.\nTheorem 6.1. Let X be a nontoric normal complete rational variety with a torus action T \u00d7X \u2192\nX of complexity one and Cox ring R(X) = R(A, P ). Then the following statements are equivalent.\n(i) The variety X is almost homogeneous.\n(ii) There exists a horizontal Demazure P -root.\nMoreover, if one of these statements holds, and R(A, P ) is minimally presented, then the number\nr \u2212 1 of relations of R(A, P ) is bounded by\nr \u2212 1 \u2264\n\ndim(X) + rk(Cl(X)) \u2212 m \u2212 2.\n\nProof. If (i) holds, then Aut(X) acts with an open orbit on X and by Corollary 5.11, there must\nbe a horizontal Demazure P -root \u03ba. Conversely, if (ii) holds, then there is a horizontal Demazure\nP -root \u03ba and Corollary 5.11 says that for U = p\u2217 (\u03b4\u03ba (Ga )), the group T \u22c9 U acts with an open\norbit on X.\nFor the supplement, recall first that R(A, P ) is a complete intersection with r \u2212 1 necessary\nrelations and thus we have\nn + m \u2212 (r \u2212 1) = dim(R(A, P )) = dim(X) + rk(Cl(X)).\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n21\n\nNow observe that any relation gI involving only three variables prevents existence of a horizontal\nDemazure P -root. Consequently, by suitably arranging the relations, we have n0 , n1 \u2265 1 and\nni \u2265 2 for all i \u2265 2. Thus, n \u2265 2 + 2(r \u2212 1) holds and the assertion follows.\n\u0003\nWe specialize to dimension two. Any normal complete rational K\u2217 -surface X is determined\nby its Cox ring and thus is given up to isomorphism by the defining data A and P of the ring\nR(X) = R(A, P ); we also say that the K\u2217 -surface X arises from A and P and refer to [12, Sec. 3.3]\nfor more background. A first step towards the almost homogeneous X is to determine possible\nhorizontal Demazure P -roots in the following setting.\nProposition 6.2. Consider integers l02 \u2265 1, l11 \u2265 l21 \u2265 2 and d01 , d02 , d11 , d21 such that the\nfollowing matrix has pairwise different primitive columns generating Q3 as a convex cone:\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u22121 \u2212l02 l11\n0\nP := \uf8f0 \u22121 \u2212l02\n0 l21 \uf8fb .\nd01\nd02 d11 d21\n\nMoreover, assume that P is positive in the sense that det(P01 ) > 0 holds, where P01 is the 3 \u00d7 3\nmatrix obtained from P by deleting the first column.

In the situation of (i), evaluating the general linear form u = (u1 , u2 , u3 ) on the columns\nof P gives the following conditions for a Demazure P -root:\n\u2212u1 \u2212 u2 + u3 d01 = 0,\n\nu2 l21 + u3 d21 = \u22121,\n\n\u2212u1 l02 \u2212 u2 l02 + u3 d02 \u2265 l02 ,\nu1 l11 + u3 d11 \u2265 0.\nResolving the equations for u1 , u2 and plugging the result into the inequalities gives the desired\nroots with \u03b1 := u3 . The other cases are treated analogously.\n\u0003\nCorollary 6.3. The nontoric almost homogeneous normal complete rational K\u2217 -surfaces X of\nPicard number one are precisely the ones arising from data\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u22121 \u2212l02 l11\n0\n0 \u22121 1\n0 l21 \uf8fb\nA =\n,\nP = \uf8f0 \u22121 \u2212l02\n1 \u22121 0\nd01\nd02 d11 d21\nas in 6.2 allowing an integer \u03b1 according to one of the Conditions 6.2 (i) to (iv). In particular,\nthe Cox ring of X is given as\nR(X)\n\nl02\nl11\nl21\n= K[T01 , T02 , T11 , T21 ] / hT01 T02\n+ T11\n+ T21\ni\n\n\f22\n\nI. ARZHANTSEV, J. HAUSEN, E. HERPPICH, AND A. LIENDO\n\nwith the grading by Z4 /im(P \u2217 ). Moreover, the anticanonical divisor of X is ample, i.e. X is a del\nPezzo surface.\nProof. As any surface with finitely generated Cox ring, X is Q-factorial. Since X has Picard\nnumber one, the divisor class group Cl(X) is of rank one. Now take a minimal presentation\nR(X) = R(A, P ) of the Cox ring. Then, according to Theorem 6.1, we have m = 0 and there\nis exactly one relation in R(A, P ). Thus P is a 3 \u00d7 4 matrix. Moreover, Theorem 6.1 says that\nthere is a horizontal Demazure P -root. Consequently, one of the exponents l01 and l02 must equal\none, say l01 . Fixing a suitable order for the last two variables we ensure l11 \u2265 l21 . Passing to the\nK\u2217 -action t\u22121 * x instead of t * x if necessary, we achieve that P is positive in the sense of 6.2.\nLet us see why X is a del Pezzo surface. Denote by Pij the matrix obtained from P by deleting\nthe column vij . Then, in Cl(X)0 = Z, the factor group of Cl(X) by the torsion part, the weights\n0\nwij\nof Tij are given up to a factor \u03b1 as\n0\n0\n0\n0\n, w11\n, w21\n) =\n(w01\n, w02\n\n\u03b1(det(P01 ), \u2212 det(P02 ), det(P11 ), \u2212 det(P21 )).\n\nAccording to [1, Prop. III.3.4.1], the class of the anticanonical divisor in Cl(X)0 is given as the\n0\nminus the degree of the relation. The inequalities on the lij , dij implied by the\nsum over all wij\nexistence of an integer \u03b1 as in 6.2 (i) to (iv) show that the anticanonical class is positive (note\nthat \u03b1 rules out).\n\u0003\nWe turn to the case of precisely one singular point. The diophantic aspect of Conditions 6.2 (i)\nto (iv) on existence of Demazure P -roots then disappears: there is no divisibility condition any\nmore.\nConstruction 6.4 (K\u2217 -surfaces with one singularity). Consider a triple (l0 , l1 , l2 ) of integers\nsatisfying the following conditions:\nl0 \u2265 1,\n\nl1 \u2265 l2 \u2265 2,\n\nl0 < l1 l2 ,\n\ngcd(l1 , l2 ) = 1.\n\nLet (d1 , d2 ) be the (unique) pair of integers with d1 l2 + d2 l1 = \u22121 and 0\nthe data\n\uf8ee\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u22121 \u2212l0 l1\n0 \u22121 1\nA =\n,\nP = \uf8f0 \u22121 \u2212l0\n0\n1 \u22121 0\n0\n1 d1\n\n\u2264 d2 < l2 and consider\n\uf8f9\n0\nl2 \uf8fb\nd2\n4\n\u2217 \u223c\nThen the associated ring R(l0 , l1 , l2 ) := R(A, P ) is graded by Z /im(P ) = Z, and is explicitly\ngiven by\nR(l0 , l1 , l2 ) = K[T1 , T2 , T3 , T4 ]/hT1 T2l0 + T3l1 + T4l2 i,\ndeg(T1 ) = l1 l2 \u2212 l0 ,\n\ndeg(T2 ) = 1,\n\ndeg(T3 ) = l2 ,\n\ndeg(T4 ) = l1 .\n\nProposition 6.5. For the K\u2217 -surface X = X(l0 , l1 , l2 ) with Cox ring R(l0 , l1 , l2 ), the following\nstatements hold:\n(i) X is nontoric and we have Cl(X) = Z,\n(ii) X comes with precisely one singularity,\n(iii) X is a del Pezzo surface if and only if l0 < l1 + l2 + 1 holds,\n(iv) X is almost homogeneous if and only if l0 \u2264 l1 holds.\nMoreover, any normal complete rational nontoric K\u2217 -surface of Picard number one with precisely\none singularity is isomorphic to some X(l0 , l1 , l2 ).\nProof. First note that X = X(l0 , l1 , l2 ) is obtained as in Construction 3.10: the group HX = K\u2217\nacts on K4 by\nt*z\n\n= (tl1 l2 \u2212l0 z1 , tz2 , tl2 z3 , tl1 z4 ),\n\nthe total coordinate space X := V (T1 T2l0 + T3l1 + T4l2 ) is invariant under this action and we have\nb = X \\ {0},\nX\n\nb \u2217.\nX = X/K\n\nThus, Cl(X) = Z holds and, since the Cox ring R(X) = R(l0 , l1 , l2 ) is not a polynomial ring, X\nis nontoric.\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n23\n\nUsing [1, Prop. III.3.1.5], we show that the sest of singular points of X consists of the image\nb under the quotient map X\nb \u2192 X. If l1 l2 \u2212 l0 > 1 holds, then\nx0 \u2208 X of the point (1, 0, 0, 0) \u2208 X\nthe local divisor class group\nCl(X, x0 ) =\n\nZ/(l1 l2 \u2212 l0 )Z\n\nis nontrivial and thus x0 \u2208 X singular. If l1 l2 \u2212 l0 = 1 holds, then we have l0 > 1 and therefore\nb and hence x0 \u2208 X is singular. Since all other local divisor class groups of X are\n(1, 0, 0, 0) \u2208 X\nb lie in the orbit K\u2217 * (1, 0, 0, 0), we conclude that\ntrivial and, moreover, all singular points of X\nx0 \u2208 X is the only singular point.\nAccording to [1, Prop. III.3.4.1], the anticanonical class of X is l1 + l2 + 1 \u2212 l0 . This proves (iii).\nFinally, for (iv), we infer from Proposition 6.2 that existence of a horizontal Demazure P -root is\nequivalent to existence of an integer \u03b1 with l0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 l1 which in turn is equivalent to l0 \u2264 l1 .\nWe come to the supplement. The surface X arises from a ring R(A, P ), where we may assume\nthat R(A, P ) is minimally presented. The first task is to show that n = 4, m = 0 and r = 2 holds.\nWe have\nn + m \u2212 (r \u2212 1) = dim(X) + rk(Cl(X)) = 3.\nAny relation gI involving only three variables gives rise to a singularity in the source and a\nsingularity in the sink of the K\u2217 -action. We conclude that at most two of the monomials occuring\nin the relations may depend only on one variable. Thus, the above equation shows that n = 4,\nm = 0 and r = 2 hold.\nl01 l02\nl11\nl21\nWe may assume that the defining equation is of the form T01\nT02 + T11\n+ T21\n. Again, since\none of the two elliptic fixed points must be smooth, we can conclude that one of l0j equals one,\nsay l01 . Now it is a direct consequence of the description of the local divisor class groups given\nin [1, Prop. III.3.1.5] that a K\u2217 -surface with precisely one singularity arises from a matrix P as in\nthe assertion.\n\u0003\nNow we look at the log terminal ones of the X(l0 , l1 , l2 ); recall, that a singularity is log terminal if\nall its resolutions have discrepancies bigger than \u22121. Over C, the log terminal surface singularities\nare precisely the quotient singularities by subgroups of GL2 (C), see for example [18, Sec. 4.6]. The\nGorenstein index of X is the minimal positive integer \u0131(X) such that \u0131(X) times the canonical\ndivisor KX is Cartier.\nCorollary 6.6. Assume that X = X(l1 , l2 , l3 ) is log terminal. Then we have the following three\ncases:\n(i) the surface X is almost homogeneous,\n(ii) the singularity of X is of type E7 ,\n(iii) the singularity of X is of type E8 .\nMoreover, for the almost homogenoeus surfaces X = X(l1 , l2 , l3 ) of Gorenstein index \u0131(X) = a,\nwe have\n(i) (l0 , l1 , l2 ) = (1, l1 , l2 ) with the bounds l2 \u2264 l1 \u2264 2a2 + 34 a,\n(ii) (l0 , l1 , l2 ) = (2, l1 , 2) with the bound l1 \u2264 3a + 2,\n(iii) (l0 , l1 , l2 ) = (3, 3, 2), (2, 4, 3), (2, 5, 3), (3, 5, 2).\nProof. The condition that X is log terminal means that the number l0 l1 l2 is bounded by l0 l1 +\nl0 l2 + l1 l2 ; this can be seen by explicitly performing the canonical resolution of singularities of\nX(l0 , l1 , l2 ), see [12, Sec. 3]. Thus, the allowed (l0 , l1 , l2 ) must be platonic triples and we are left\nwith\n(1, l1 , l2 ), (2, l1 , 2), (3, 3, 2), (2, 4, 3), (2, 5, 3), (3, 5, 2), (4, 3, 2), (5, 3, 2).\nThe last two give the surfaces with singularities E7 , E8 and in all other cases, the resulting surface\nis almost homogeneous by Proposition 6.5. The Gorenstein condition says that aKX lies in the\nPicard group. According to [1, Cor. III.3.1.6], this is equivalent to the fact that l1 l2 \u2212 l0 divides\na * (l1 + l2 + 1 \u2212 l0 ). The bounds then follow by elementary estimations.\n\u0003\n\n\f24\n\nI. ARZHANTSEV, J. HAUSEN, E. HERPPICH, AND A. LIENDO\n\nCorollary 6.7. The following tables list the triples (l0 , l1 , l2 ) together with roots of Aut(X) for\nthe log terminal almost homogeneous complete rational K\u2217 -surfaces X = X(l0 , l1 , l2 ) with precisely\none singularity up to Gorenstein index \u0131(X) = 5.\n\u0131(X) = 2\n\u0131(X) = 1\n(1, 3, 2) : {1, 2, 3} (1, 7, 3) : {1, 3, 4, 7}\n(2, 3, 2) : {2, 3}\n(3, 3, 2) : {3}\n\n\u0131(X) = 3\n(2, 7, 2) : {2, 3, 5, 7}\n(1, 13, 4) : {1, 4, 5, 9, 13}\n(1, 8, 5) : {3, 5, 8}\n\n\u0131(X) = 5\n\u0131(X) = 4\n(2, 5, 2) : {2, 3, 5}\n(2, 11, 2) : {2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11}\n(1, 21, 5) : {1, 5, 6, 11, 16, 21} (1, 13, 7) : {2, 6, 13}\n(2, 4, 3) : {3, 4}\n(1, 17, 3) : {2, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17}\n(1, 31, 6) : {1, 6, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31}\n(1, 18, 7) : {4, 7, 11, 18}\n7. Structure of the semisimple part\nWe describe the root system of the semisimple part of the automorphism group of a nontoric\nnormal complete rational variety admitting a torus action of complexity one. Let us first recall\nthe necessary background on semisimple groups and their root systems.\nA connected linear algebraic group G is semisimple if it has only trivial closed connected commutative normal subgroups. Any linear algebraic group G admits a maximal connected semisimple\nsubgroup Gss \u2286 G called a semisimple part. The semisimple part is unique up to conjugation by\nelements from the unipotent radical. If G is semisimple, then the set \u03a6G \u2286 XR (T ) of roots with\nrespect to a given maximal torus T \u2286 G is a root system, i.e. for every \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6G one has\n\u03a6G \u2229 R\u03b1 = {\u00b1\u03b1},\n\ns\u03b1 (\u03a6G ) = \u03a6G ,\n\nwhere s\u03b1 : XR (T ) \u2192 XR (T ) denotes the reflection with fixed hyperplane \u03b1\u22a5 with respect to a\ngiven scalar product on XR (T ). The possible root systems are elementarily classified; for us, the\nfollowing types (always realized with the standard scalar product) will be important:\nAn := {ei \u2212 ej ; 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n + 1, i 6= j} \u2286 Rn+1 ,\nB2 := {\u00b1e1 , \u00b1e2 , \u00b1(e1 + e2 ), \u00b1(e1 \u2212 e2 )} \u2286 R2 .\nThe root system of a connected semisimple linear group G determines G up to coverings; for\nexample, An belongs to the (simply connected) special linear group SLn+1 and B2 to the (simply\nconnected) symplectic group Sp4 .\nWe turn to varieties with a complexity one torus action. Consider data A, P as in Construction 3.7 and the resulting ring R(A, P ) with its fine K0 -grading and the coarser K-grading. Recall\nthat the fine grading group K0 splits as\nK0 = K0vert \u2295 K0hor ,\n\nwhere\n\nK0vert := hdegK0 (Sk )i,\n\nK0hor := hdegK0 (Tij )i.\n\nNote that K0vert \u223c\n= Zm is freely generated by degK0 (S1 ), . . . , degK0 (Sm ). Moreover, by Remark 3.9,\nthe direct factor Zs of the column space Zr+s of P is identified via Q0 \u25e6 P \u2217 with the kernel of the\ndowngrading map K0 \u2192 K.\nDefinition 7.1. Let A, P be as in Construction 3.7 such that the associated ring R(A, P ) is\nminimally presented and write \u03b1\u03ba for the P -root, i.e. the Zs -part, associated to Demazure P root \u03ba.\n(i) We call a P -root \u03b1\u03ba semisimple if \u2212\u03b1\u03ba = \u03b1\u03ba\u2032 holds for some Demazure P -root \u03ba\u2032 .\n(ii) We call a semisimple P -root \u03b1\u03ba vertical if \u03b1\u03ba \u2208 K0vert and horizontal if \u03b1\u03ba \u2208 K0hor holds.\nvert\n(iii) We write \u03a6ss\nand \u03a6hor\nP , \u03a6P\nP for the set of semisimple, vertical semisimple and horizontal\nsemisimple P -roots in Rs respectively.\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n25\n\nTheorem 7.2.

Some of the steps are needed\nlater on and therefore formulated as Lemmas. We fix A, P as in Construction 3.7 and assume that\nR(A, P ) is minimally presented.\nLemma 7.3. Let \u03b4 be a nonzero primitive K0 -homogeneous locally nilpotent derivation on R(A,\nP P ),\nbk wk\ndecompose degK0 (\u03b4) = wvert + whor according to K0 = K0vert \u2295 K0hor and write wvert =\nwith wk = degK0 (Sk ) and bk \u2208 Z.\n(i) If \u03b4 is of vertical type, then there is a k0 with bk0 = \u22121 and bk \u2265 0 for all k 6= k0 .\nMoreover, whor belongs to the weight monoid of R(A, P ).\n(ii) If \u03b4 is of horizontal type, then bk \u2265 0 holds for all k. Moreover, \u2212whor does not belong\nto the weight monoid of R(A, P ).\nProof. If \u03b4 is nonzero of vertical type, then Theorem 4.3 (i) directly yields the assertion. If \u03b4 is\nnonzero of horizontal type, then it is of the form \u03b4 = h\u03b4C,\u03b2 as in Theorem 4.3 (ii). For the degree\nof \u03b4, we have\ndegK0 (\u03b4) = wvert + whor = degK0 (h)vert + degK0 (h)hor + degK0 (\u03b4C,\u03b2 ),\n\n\f26\n\nI. ARZHANTSEV, J. HAUSEN, E. HERPPICH, AND A. LIENDO\n\nwhere degK0 (\u03b4C,\u03b2 ) lies in K0hor by Construction 4.2. Since degK0 (h)vert belongs to the weight\nmonoid S and, due to primitivity, degK0 (\u03b4) lies outside the weight cone, we must have whor 6= 0.\nMoreover, for a Tij with \u03b4(Tij ) 6= 0 and wij := degK0 (Tij ), the degree computation of Construction 4.2 shows\n0 6= degK0 (h)hor + degK0 (\u03b4C,\u03b2 ) + wij = degK0 (\u03b4(Tij ))hor .\nThus, whor + wij is a nonzero element in S. If also \u2212whor belongs to S, then we can take\n0 6= f, g \u2208 R(A, P ) homogeneous of degree whor + wij and \u2212whor respectively. The product f g\nis of degree wij . By Corollary 3.6, this means f g = cTij with c \u2208 K. A contradiction to the fact\nthat Tij is K0 -prime.\n\u0003\nBy definition, the semisimple roots occur in pairs \u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 with \u03b1+ + \u03b1\u2212 = 0. Given a pair\n\u03ba+ , \u03ba\u2212 of Demazure P -roots defining \u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 , write \u03b4+ , \u03b4\u2212 for the derivations arising from \u03ba+ , \u03ba\u2212\nvia Construction 5.7. We call the pairs \u03ba+ , \u03ba\u2212 and \u03b4+ , \u03b4\u2212 associated to \u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 . Note that\nassociated pairs \u03ba+ , \u03ba\u2212 or \u03b4+ , \u03b4\u2212 are in general not uniquely determined by \u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 .\nLemma 7.4. Let \u03b4+ , \u03b4\u2212 be a pair of primitive K0 -homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations associated to a pair \u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 of semisimple roots.\n(i) The roots \u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 are the K0 -degrees of the derivations \u03b4+ , \u03b4\u2212 . In particular, we have\ndegK0 (\u03b4+ ) + degK0 (\u03b4\u2212 ) = \u03b1+ + \u03b1\u2212 = 0.\n(ii) If \u03b4+ is of vertical type, then also \u03b4\u2212 is of vertical type and \u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 are both vertical.\n(iii) If \u03b4+ is of horizontal type, then also \u03b4\u2212 is of horizontal type and \u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 are both horizontal.\nProof. The first assertion is clear by Construction 5.7. Using the decomposition K0 = K0vert \u2295K0hor ,\nwe obtain\nvert\nhor\n\u03b1vert\n= 0,\n\u03b1hor\n= 0.\n+ + \u03b1\u2212\n+ + \u03b1\u2212\nhor\nIf \u03b4+ is of horizontal type, then Lemma 7.3 (ii) shows that \u2212\u03b1hor\n+ = \u03b1\u2212 does not belong to\nthe weight monoid. Thus Lemma 7.3 (i) says that \u03b4\u2212 must be of horizontal type. Moreover,\nvanish and thus \u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 are horizontal.\nand \u03b1vert\nLemma 7.3 (ii) shows that \u03b1vert\n\u2212\n+\nIf \u03b4+ is of vertical type, then, by the preceeding consideration, also \u03b4\u2212 must be vertical. Morehor\nover, Lemma 7.3 (i) tells us that \u03b1hor\n+ and \u03b1\u2212 both belong to the weight monoid. As seen above\nhor\nthey have opposite signs. Since the weight cone is pointed, we obtain \u03b1hor\n+ = \u03b1\u2212 = 0 which\nmeans that \u03b1+ , \u03b1\u2212 are vertical.\n\u0003\n\nFor the subsequent study, we will perform certain elementary column and row operations with\nthe matrix P which we will call admissible:\n(I) swap two columns inside a block vij1 , . . . , vijni ,\n(II) swap two whole column blocks vij1 , . . . , vijni and vi\u2032 j1 , . . . , vi\u2032 jni\u2032 ,\n(III) add multiples of the upper r rows to one of the last s rows,\n(IV) any elementary row operation among the last s rows.\n(V) swap two columns inside the d\u2032 block.\nThe operations of type (III) and (IV) do not change the ring R(A, P ) whereas the types (I), (II),\n(V) correspond to certain renumberings of the variables of R(A, P ) keeping the (graded) isomorphy\ntype.\nFor a Demazure P -root \u03ba = (u, k0 ) of vertical type, the index k0 is uniquely determined by the\nZs -part of u. Thus, we may speak of the distinguished index of a vertical P -root. Note that for\nany pair \u03b1\u00b1 of vertical semisimple P -roots, the distinguished indices satisfy k0+ 6= k0\u2212 .\nLemma 7.5. Let 1 \u2264 k0+ < k0\u2212 \u2264 m be given and denote by f \u2208 Zn+m the vector with fk\u00b1 = \u22131\n0\nand all other entries zero. Then the following statements are equivalent.\n(i) There exists a pair \u03b1\u00b1 of vertical semisimple roots with distinguished indices k0\u00b1 .\n(ii) The vector f can be realized by admissible operations of type (III) and (IV) as the (r+1)th\nrow of P .\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n27\n\n(iii) The variables Sk+ and Sk\u2212 have the same K-degree.\n0\n\n0\n\nProof. Suppose that (i) holds. Let \u03ba\u00b1 = (u\u00b1 , k0\u00b1 ) be a pair of Demazure P -roots associated to\n\u03b1\u00b1 . Then u := u+ + u\u2212 satisfies hu, vij i \u2265 0 for all i, j and hu, vk i \u2265 0 for all k. Since the columns\nof P generate Qr+s as a cone, we obtain u = 0. Consequently u\u2212 = \u2212u+ holds and we conclude\nhu+ , vk i = 0 for all k 6= k0\u00b1 ,\n\nhu+ , vij i = 0 for all i, j,\nhu+ , vk+ i = \u22121,\n0\n\n+\n\n+\n(u+\n1 ,\u03b1 )\n+\n\nNow write u =\nthe (primitive) row \u03b1\n\ns\n\nhu+ , vk\u2212 i = 1.\n0\n\n+\n\nwith the Z -part \u03b1 and let \u03c3 be an (s \u2212 1) \u00d7 s matrix complementing\nto a unimodular matrix. Consider the block matrix\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nEr\n0\n\uf8f0 u+\n\u03b1+ \uf8fb .\n1\n0\n\u03c3\n\nApplying this matrix from the left to P describes admissible operations of type (III) and (IV)\nrealizing the vector f as the (r + 1)th row of P . Thus, (i) implies (ii).\nTo see that (ii) implies (i), we may assume that f is already the (r + 1)th row of P . Consider\ns\n\u00b1\nu\u00b1 \u2208 Zr+s having u\u00b1\nr+1 = \u00b11 as the only nonzero coordinate. Then the Z -parts \u03b1 of the vertical\n\u00b1\n\u00b1 \u00b1\nDemazure P -roots \u03ba = (u , k0 ) are as wanted.\nClearly, (ii) implies (iii). Conversely, the implication \"(iii)\u21d2(ii)\" is obtained by similar arguments as \"(i)\u21d2(ii)\".\n\u0003\nLemma 7.6. Let Eq denote the q \u00d7 (q + 1) block matrix [\u22121, Eq ], where 1 is a column with all\nentries equal one and Eq is the q \u00d7 q unit matrix.

Clearly, we may assume C+ =\n(1, 1, 1) and by suitable row operations, we bring P into the form\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u22122 1\n1 0 0\n0 l2 0 \uf8fb\nP = \uf8f0 \u22122 0\nd01 0 d12 d2 d\u2032\n\n+\nNow enter the defining conditions of a Demazure P -root \u03ba+ with u+ = (u+\n1 , u2 , \u03b1+ ).

Again, the\nremaining statements are directly seen.\n\u0003\nis a root system and has the desired form. This\nProof of Theorem 7.2. Lemma 7.6 shows that \u03a6vert\nP\nproves (ii). Concerning \u03a6hor\nP , assertion (iii) as well as the cases l21 + . . .+ l2n2 \u2265 3 of assertions (iv)\nand (v) are proven by Lemmas 7.7, 7.8 and 7.9. The remaining cases of (iv) and (v) are deduced\nare root systems of\nand \u03a6hor\nusing the special shape of P guaranteed by Lemma 7.7. So, \u03a6vert\nP\nP\nthe desired shape. Lemma 7.4 and the decomposition of K0 into a vertical and a horizontal part\nvert\nand \u03a6hor\nshow that \u03a6ss\nP .\nP splits into the direct sum of \u03a6P\nTo conclude the proof, we have to verify that \u03a6ss\nP is in fact the root system of the semisimple\npart of Aut(X). For this, it suffices to realize the root system \u03a6ss\nP as the root system of some\nsemisimple subgroup G \u2286 Aut(X) (which then necessarily is a semisimple part). Consider X :=\n\n\f30\n\nI. ARZHANTSEV, J. HAUSEN, E. HERPPICH, AND A. LIENDO\n\nSpec R(A, P ) and the action of HX := Spec K[K]. The group G \u2286 Aut(X) will be induced by\na representation of a suitable semisimple group on Kn+m commuting with the action of HX and\nleaving X := Spec R(A, P ) invariant.\nvert\nWe first care about \u03a6vert\n:= \u00d7p SLmp . It acts on Kn+m :\nP . Consider the semisimple group G\ntriviallly on Kn and blockwise on Km = \u2295p Kmp . This action commutes with the action of HX and\nb invariant. Thus the Gvert -action descends to X. This realizes Gvert \u2286 Aut(X)\nleaves X as well as X\nas a subgroup with root system \u03a6vert\nP .\nSimilarly, going through the cases, we realize \u03a6hor\nas a root system of a semisimple group\nP\nGhor \u2286 Aut(X). Recall that for the defining relation, we have the possibilities\n(a) T01 T02 + T11 T12 + T2l2 ,\n\n2\n(b) T01 T02 + T11\n+ T2l2 .\n\nConsider case (a). If we have the equations w01 = w 11 and w 02 = w 12 , then g \u2208 SL2 acts on the\nT01 , T11 -space as (g t )\u22121 and on the T02 , T12 -space as g. By trivial extension, we obtain an action\non Kn+m commuting with the H-action, leaving the defining relation and thus X invariant. Thus,\nwe have an induced effective action of a semisimple group Ghor with root system A1 on X.\nIf we have w 01 = w 02 = w11 = w 12 , then the canonical action of the group SO4 on the\nT01 , T11 , T02 , T12 -space extends trivially to Kn+m , commutes with the action of HX and leaves X\ninvariant. Again, this gives an induced effective action of a semisimple group Ghor on X, this time\nthe root system is A1 \u2295 A1 ; recall that SO4 has SL2 \u00d7 SL2 as its universal covering.\nNow let n2 = 2 and l21 = l22 = 1. Then we have n = 6. If all six K-degrees w ij coincide,\nthen take the action of SO6 on Kn and extend it trivially to Kn+m . This induces an action of a\nsemisimple group Ghor on X. The root system is that of the universal covering SL4 , i.e. we obtain\nA3 . If all w i1 and all wi2 coincide but we have w 01 6= w 02 , then consider the action of SL3 given\nby (g t )\u22121 on the Ti1 -space and by g on the Ti2 -space. This leads to a Ghor with root system A2 .\nFinally, consider case (b). If w 01 = w 02 = w11 holds, then the canonical action of the group SO3\non the T01 , T02 , T11 -space defines a semisimple subgroup Ghor of Aut(X) with root system A1 . If\nn2 = 1 and l21 = 2 holds and we have w01 = w 02 = w 11 = w21 , then n = 4 holds and the canonical\naction of SO4 on Kn induces a semisimple subgroup Ghor of Aut(X) with root system A1 \u2295 A1 .\nIf we have n2 = 2 and l21 = l22 = 1 and all degrees w ij coincide, then the canonical action of SO5\non K5 extends to Kn+m and induces a subgroup Ghor of Aut(X) with root system B2 .\nAlltogether, we realized the root systems \u03a6vert\nand \u03a6hor\nby semisimple subgroups Gvert and\nP\nP\nhor\nG\nof Aut(X). By construction, these groups commute and thus define a semisimple subgroup\nvert\nG := Gvert Ghor of Aut(X) with the desired root system \u03a6ss\n\u2295 \u03a6hor\n\u0003\nP = \u03a6P\nP .\nCorollary 7.11 (of proof). In the situation of Theorem 7.2, any pair of semisimple roots defines\na subgroup of the automorphism group locally isomorphic to SL2 .\n8. Applications\nIn this section we present applications of Theorem 7.2. A first one concerns the automorphism\ngroup of arbitrary nontoric Mori dream surfaces (not necessarily admitting a K\u2217 -action).\nProposition 8.1. Let X be a nontoric Mori dream surface. Then Aut(X)0 is solvable and the\nfollowing cases can occur:\n(i) X is a K\u2217 -surface,\n(ii) Aut(X)0 is unipotent.\nProof. Consider a maximal torus T \u2286 Aut(X)0 . If T is trivial, then we are in case (ii). In\nparticular, Aut(X)0 is solvable then. If T is one-dimensional, then we are in case (i) and the task\nis to show that the semisimple part of Aut(X) is trivial, i.e. Aut(X) has no semisimple roots. For\nthis, we remark first that as a Mori dream surface with a nontrivial K\u2217 -action, X is rational. Thus,\nwe may assume that X arises from A, P as in Construction 3.7 and that R(A, P ) is minimally\npresented. Note that we have s = 1.\nThe estimate of Theorem 7.2 (ii) forbids vertical semisimple P -roots. Let us see why there\nare no horizontal semisimple P -roots. Otherwise, Lemmas 7.8 and 7.10 show that we must have\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\nm = 0 and, up to admissible operations,\n\uf8ee\n\u22121 \u22121 1 1\n\uf8f0 \u22121 \u22121 0 0\n\u22121\n0 0 1\n\n31\n\nthe matrix P is one of the following:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0\n\u22122 1 1 0\n\uf8f0 \u22122 0 0 l2 \uf8fb .\nl2 \uf8fb ,\n0\n\u22121 0 1 0\n\nSince the columns of P are pairwise different primitive vectors, we obtain n2 = 1 and l21 = 1; a\ncontradiction to the assumption that the ring R(A, P ) is minimally presented.\n\u0003\nWe take a brief look at q-dimensional varieties X coming with a nontrivial action of SLq . They\nwere classified (in the smooth case) by Mabuchi [16]. Let us see how to obtain the rational nontoric\npart of his list with the aid of Theorem 7.2.\nExample 8.2. Let X a nontoric q-dimensional complete normal variety with a nontrivial action\nof SLq . Since SLq has only finite normal subgroups, X comes with a torus action T \u00d7 X \u2192 X of\ncomplexity one. Proposition 8.1 tells us that X is of dimension at least three. If SLq acts with an\nopen orbit, then X has a finitely generated divisor class group and, by existence of the T -action of\ncomplexity one, must be rational. So, we may assume that we are in the setting of Theorem 7.2,\nwhere we end up in the cases A2 , A3 of second item of (iv) which amounts to the following two\npossibilities.\n(i) We have q = 3 and X is the flag variety SL3 /B3 ; in particular, Cl(X) \u223c\n= Z2 and\nR(X) \u223c\n= K[T01 , T02 , T11 , T12 , T21 , T22 ] / hT01 T02 + T11 T12 + T21 T22 i\nhold, where the Z2 -grading is given by\ndeg(T01 ) = deg(T11 ) = deg(T21 ) = (1, 0),\ndeg(T02 ) = deg(T12 ) = deg(T22 ) = (0, 1).\n(ii) We have q = 4 and X is the smooth quadric V (T0 T1 + T2 T3 + T4 T5 ) in P5 , where SL4\nacts as the universal covering of SO6 .\nNow assume that SLq acts with orbits of dimension at most q \u2212 1. Then this action gives a root\nsystem Aq\u22121 \u2286 \u03a6vert\nP . If X were rational, then Theorem 7.2 (ii) would require q < dim(X) which\nis excluded by assumption. Thus, X must be nonrational. In particular, the rational nontoric\npart of Mabuchi's list is established, even for a priori singular varieties.\nWe turn to nontoric varieties with a torus action of complexity one which are almost homogeneous under some reductive group. Recall that an action of a reductive group G on X is spherical\nif some Borel subgroup of G acts with an open orbit on X.\nProposition 8.3. Let X be a nontoric complete normal variety. Then the following statements\nare equivalent.\n(i) X allows a torus action of complexity one and an almost homogeneous reductive group\naction.\n(ii) X is spherical with respect to an action of a reductive group of semisimple rank one.\n(iii) X is isomorphic to a variety as in Theorem 7.2 (iii).\nProof. The implication \"(ii)\u21d2(i)\" is obvious. For the implication \"(iii)\u21d2(ii)\", take a pair of\nsemisimple horizontal P -roots \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 . Then the acting torus T of X and the root subgroups\nU\u00b1 associated to \u03b1\u00b1 generate a reductive group G of semisimple rank one in Aut(X) and X is\nspherical with respect to the action of G.\nAssume that (i) holds. Then the open orbit of the acting reductive group G is unirational.\nThus, X is unirational. By the existence of a torus action of complexity one, X contains an open\nsubset of the form T \u00d7 C with some affine curve C. We conclude that C and hence X are rational.\nConsequently, X is a Mori dream space. In particular, Corollary 2.4 yields that Aut(X) is linear\nalgebraic. Moreover, we may assume that we are in the setting of Theorem 7.2. The image of\nG0 in Aut(X) is contained in a maximal connected reductive subgroup G\u2032 of Aut(X). Suitably\nconjugating G\u2032 , we may assume that the acting torus T of X is a maximal torus of G\u2032 . Since\nG\u2032 is generated by root subgroups, we infer from Corollary 5.11 that there must be a horizontal\nDemazure P -root. Since every root of G\u2032 is semisimple, we end up in Case 7.2 (iii).\n\u0003\n\n\f32\n\nI. ARZHANTSEV, J. HAUSEN, E. HERPPICH, AND A. LIENDO\n\nSpecializing to dimension three, we obtain a quite precise picture of the possible matrices P in\nthe above setting.\nProposition 8.4. Let X be a three-dimensional nontoric complete normal rational variety. Suppose that X is almost homogeneous under an action of a reductive group and there is an effective\naction of a two-dimensional torus on X. Then the Cox ring of X is given as R(X) = R(A, P )\nwith a matrix P according to the following cases\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u22121 \u22121 1\n1 0 0\n\uf8ef \u22121 \u22121 0\n0 l2\n0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa,\n(i)\nP = \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 \u22121\n0 0\n1 0 0 \uf8fb\n0\n0 0 d\u221712 d\u22172 d\u2032\u2217\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u22122 1 1 0 0\n\uf8ef \u22122 0 0 l2\n0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n(ii)\nP = \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 \u22121 0 1 0 0 \uf8fb.\nd\u221701 0 0 d\u22172 d\u2032\u2217\nIn both cases, we have m \u2264 2; that means that the d\u2032\u2217 -part can be either empty, equal to \u00b11 or\nequal to (\u00b11, \u22131).\nProof. Clearly, we may assume that we are in the situation of Theorem 7.2. Since X is nontoric but\nalmost homogeneous, there must be a semisimple horizontal P -root. Thus, Lemmas 7.8 and 7.10\nshow that after admissible operations, P is of the desired shape.\n\u0003\nAs a direct consequence, one retrieves results of Haddad [9] on the Cox rings of three-dimensional\nvarieties that are almost homogeneous under an SL2 -action and additionally come with an effective\naction of a two-dimensional torus T ; compare also [2] for the affine case.\nCorollary 8.5. Let X be a three-dimensional nontoric complete normal rational variety. Suppose\nthat X is almost homogeneous under an action of SL2 and there is an effective action of a twodimensional torus T on X. Then X has at most two T -invariant prime divisors with infinite\nT -isotropy, i.e., we have m \u2264 2 and the Cox ring of X is given as\nR(X) =\n\nl\n\nl21\nK[Tij , Sk ]/hT01 T02 + T11 T12 + T21\n* * * T2n2n22 i.\n\nProof. We are in the situation of Proposition 8.4. The assumption that SL2 acts with an open\norbit implies that we are in case (i).\n\u0003\nFinally, we consider almost homogeneous varieties with reductive automorphism group; see for\nexample [19] for results on the toric case. Here, we list all almost homogeneous threefolds of Picard\nnumber one with a reductive automorphism group having a maximal torus of dimension two.\nProposition 8.6. Let X be a Q-factorial three-dimensional complete normal variety of Picard\nnumber one. Suppose that Aut(X) is reductive, has a maximal torus of dimension two and acts\nwith an open orbit on X. Then X is a rational Fano variety and, up to isomorphy, arises from a\nmatrix P from the following list:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u22121 \u22121 1\n1\n0\n\uf8ef \u22121 \u22121 0\n0 l21 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa , l > 1, d12 > 2, \u2212 d21 < l21 < \u2212d21 ,\n(i) \uf8ef\nd12 \u22121\n\uf8f0 \u22121\n0 0\n1\n0 \uf8fb 21\n0\n0 0 d12 d21\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u22122 1 1\n0\n0\n\uf8ef \u22122 0 0 l21 l22 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa , l , l > 1, 2d22 > \u2212d01 l22 , \u22122d21 > d01 l21 ,\n(ii) \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 \u22121 0 1\n0\n0 \uf8fb 21 22\nd01 0 0 d21 d22\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u22122 1 1\n0\n0\nl22 > 1, d22 > d21 l22 + l22 , 2d22 > \u2212d01 l22 , \u22122d21 > d01 ,\n\uf8ef \u22122 0 0\n1 l22 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa , or\n(iii) \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 \u22121 0 1\n\uf8fb\n0\n0\nl22 > 1, 2d22 > \u2212d01 l22 , 1 \u2212 2d21 > d01 ,\nd01 0 0 d21 d22\n\n\fTHE AUTOMORPHISM GROUP OF A VARIETY WITH TORUS ACTION\n\n33\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\u22122 1 1 0 0\n\uf8ef \u22122 0 0 1 1 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n(iv) \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 \u22121 0 1 0 0 \uf8fb ,\n\u22121 0 0 1 0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u22122 1 1\n0 0\n\uf8ef \u22122 0 0 l21 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa , 1 < l21 < \u22122d21 < 2l21 .\n(v) \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 \u22121 0 1\n0 0 \uf8fb\n1 0 0 d21 1\nConversely, each of the above listed matrices defines a Q-factorial rational almost homogeneous\nFano variety with reductive automorphism group having a two-dimensional maximal torus.\nProof. According to Proposition 8.3, we may assume that X arises from a matrix P . The fact that\nAut(X) is reductive means that every root must be semisimple and the fact that it acts with an\nopen orbit means that there exists at least one pair of horizontal semisimple roots. Now, suppose\nwe have m = 0. If there is only one pair of horizontal semisimple P -roots, then reductivity of the\nautomorphism group forbids further P -roots and we end up with the first three cases. If there are\nmore then one pair of semisimple roots, then we end up in case four. Finally, if m > 0 holds, then\nm = 1 is the only possibility and one is left with case (v).\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] I. Arzhantsev, U. Derenthal, J. Hausen, A.
