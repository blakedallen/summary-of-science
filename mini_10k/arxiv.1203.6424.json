Introduction\nThailand Insurance industry is subject to government\nregulation to protect policyholders, third-party liability\nclaimant, and other related business. Solvency supervision,\nregulations and solvency position classification is an\nimportant topic for non-life insurers. Most of the studies\nwere implemented in the United States and many previous\nstudies focused on binary classification and the problem\nwhose class values were unordered (bankrupt/nonbankrupt, solvency/insolvency, or healthy/failed)[2-16].\nUnfortunately, they were not implemented in the multiclass classification fashion. In this paper, we hence\nproposed an ordinal multi-class classification for solvency\ncondition classification.\nNormally, The Office of\nInsurance Commission (OIC) of Thailand uses the Capital\nratio (CAR) system of non-life insurance in 2009 to\nevaluate the capital adequacy or financial solidity of the\n\nnon-life insurers (as shown in Table 1). with the condition\ndistinguished by a level of CAR, the insurance company\nand regulator's actions are required.\nTABLE 1 The solvency evaluation and regulatory actions based\non CAR system.\nClass\nClassification\n\nCapital\nadequacy ratio\n(CAR)\n\nThe action level\n\nStrong\n\n\u2265 150%\n\nNo action level\n\nModerate\n\n120 - 150%\n\nCompany action level\n\nWeak\n\n100 - 120%\n\nRegulatory action level\n\nInsolvency\n\n< 100%\n\nAuthorized control &\nMandatory control\nlevel\n\nNote: Company action level - company must file plan with insurance\ncommissioner & explaining cause of deficiency and how it will be corrected.\nRegulatory action level - The commissioner is required to examine the\ninsurer and take corrective action, if necessary. Authorized control level &\nMandatory control level - The commissioner has legal grounds to rehabilitate\nor liquidate the company, the commissioner is required to seize a company.\n\nThe level of capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of insurer is\naffected by most insurance activities and decision making\nprocesses such as premium rate making, determination of\nthe technical reserve, risk undertaking, reinsurance\nactivities, investment, sales, credibility of company to\nrelated party, and also be affected by the country's\neconomy, new legislations, inflation and interest rates [1].\nWith the help of our system, the companies can early\ndetect the solvency condition of their own and can decide\nthe most suitable policy to reduce their risk.\n\n\f2. Literature review\nAmong many empirical studies of insurance science, there\nare several studies with different techniques used for\nimproving the performance of Insolvency prediction and/or\nclassification model. Most studies applied traditional\nstatistic techniques, such as regression analysis [2],\nmultivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) [3, 4, 5], logistic\nregression (LR) [6], logit and probit model [7-10], and\nmultinomial logistic regression (MLR) [1]. On the other\nhand, machine learning techniques such as neural\nnetworks (NNs) [11-15], and genetic algorithm (GA) [16]\nwere also used in Insolvency prediction.\nKramer (1997) evaluated the financial solidity of Dutch\nnon-life insurance by combining a traditional statistic\ntechnique (ordered logit model) with artificial intelligence\ntechniques (a neural network and an expert system). The\ncomplete model contains three programs; logit model,\nneural network, and expert system. The data from year\n1992 has been used as training data set and year 1993 as\nthe test set. The output of the multi-class classification\nmodel consists of the priority for further examination\n(High, Medium, and Low class). The system which\nevaluates the financial solidity can be used to classify the\ninsurers according to their degree of risk exposures. The\nmodel correctly classified 93% of the data test set. It\nshowed very good performance for strong, medium and\nweak companies, 96.3% of the strong, 75.0% of the\nmedium and 94.4% of the weak are classified correctly.\nPitselis (2009) studied the solvency supervision,\nregulations and insolvency prediction of Greece insurance\ncompanies\nusing\nstatistical\nmethodologies,\ne.g.\ndiscriminant analysis (DA), logistic regression (LR), and\nmultinomial logistic regression (MLR) to distinguish\nsolvency position into two cases; two-class classification\n(healthy and insolvency) and multi-class classification\n(healthy, merged, and insolvency). The paper presented the\neffects of solvency position of insurance companies.\nCompany and regulatory actions are required if a\ncompany's solvency position falls below requirement. Due\nto the imbalanced data problem, especially for insolvency\ncompanies, LR and MLR failed to give reliable results. DA\nmodel was able to adequately classify Healthy, Merged,\nInsolvency companies; 93.5%, 33.3% and 100%\nrespectively (on the 1998 data set).\n2.1 A Simple Approach to Ordinal Classification\nFrank and Hall (2001) [17] presented an ordinal\nclassification approach that enables standard classification\nalgorithms to classify the ordinal class problems. Frank\nand Hall applied standard classifier in conjunction with a\ndecision tree learner. The underlying learning algorithm\ntakes advantage of ordered class values. First, the original\ndataset problem is transformed from a k-class V = {v1....\nvk} to k -1 binary-class problems. The training starts by\nderiving new datasets from the original dataset, one for\n\neach of the k-1 new class attributes. In the next step, the\nclassification algorithm is applied to generate a model for\neach of the new datasets. To predict the class value of an\nunseen instance, we need to estimate the probabilities of\nthe k original ordinal classes using our k-1 model.\nEstimation of the probability for the first and last ordinal\nclass value depends on a single classifier.\nIn General, for class values Vi , a probabilities distribution\non Vi (k-classes) is then derived as follows:\nPr (V1) = 1- Pr (Target > V1)\nPr (Vi) = max { Pr (Target > Vi-1) \u2013 Pr (Target > Vi), 0 } , 1< i < k\nPr (Vk) = 1- Pr (Target > Vk-1)\n\nTo classify an instance of an unknown class, each of the k-1\nclassifiers and the probabilities of each the k ordinal class\nvalue is calculated using method above evaluate the instance.\nThe class with maximum probability is assigned to that\ninstance.\n2.2 Decision Tree Learning Algorithm\nThe Decision Tree Learning (DTL) algorithm we used in\nthis research is the one named J48 implemented in WEKA\nmachine learning tool [18]. The J48 class is implemented\nbased on the same concept as C4.5 decision tree [19].\nThe DTL is a predictive machine learning model which\nbegins with a set of the whole training examples. It creates a\ndecision tree based on the attribute values of the training\ndata that can best classify the set of samples at a time. The\nattribute which can best discriminate the sample set is\nevaluated based on the concept of Entropy. The examples are\nthen divided into edges which is the value of the attribute.\nThe child node which consists of examples from different\nclasses will be replaced with the new attribute node, while\nthe child node containing examples from the same class will\nbe a used as a decision node, in which all examples will be\nclassified as the class of training examples collected in this\nnode.\n3. Data and Methodology\nThe data set used in this study was collected from 70 nonlife insurance companies in Thailand. The companies\nwhich were in operation or went insolvency were covered\nfrom 2000 to 2008. During this period, 616 cases (543\nstrong, 16 moderate, 13 weak and 44 insolvency) were\nselected as training data set as shown in Table 2. The data\nof year 2009 were used as a separated test set. The data\nsource comes from the annual report of The Office of\nInsurance Commission (OIC) and the health insurance\ncompanies are not including on this study.\n\n\fTABLE 2 Number of Non-life Insurance companies in this study (Data from year 2009 are the separated test set).\n\nClass\n\nInsolvency\nWeak\nModerate\nStrong\nTotal\n\n2000\n5\n1\n0\n64\n70\n\n2001\n3\n1\n1\n65\n70\n\n2002\n6\n1\n1\n62\n70\n\n2003\n5\n1\n2\n62\n70\n\n2004\n7\n2\n2\n59\n70\n\n2005\n4\n0\n4\n60\n68\n\n2006\n6\n3\n3\n56\n68\n\n2007\n5\n1\n3\n56\n65\n\n2008\n4\n3\n1\n57\n65\n\nTotal\n\n%\n\n45\n13\n17\n541\n616\n\n7.1%\n2.1%\n2.6%\n88.1%\n100 %\n\n2009\n6\n1\n1\n57\n65\n\nNote: The solvency condition in this study is determined by capital adequacy ratio\n= Total capital available (TCA) / Total capital required (TCR)\n\nThe attributes selection started from 13 attributes. We\nchose them from the most commonly used ones in\nempirical studies of insurance science. They were found\nsignificant in previous studies of predicting non-life\ninsurances' solvency [1-11, 13-16]. In this paper, we select\nthe relevant attributes using the correlation-based attribute\nsubset evaluator and greedy stepwise. All 13 attributed are\nshown in Table 3.\nTABLE 3 Attributes used in this study\nV1 Net premiums written / policyholders' surplus\nV2 Solvency margin to minimum required solvency margin\nV3 Policyholders' surplus & Technical reserve to net\nwritten premium\nV4 Claims incurred to policyholders' surplus & technical\nreserve\nV5 Gross agent's balance to policyholders' surplus\nV6 Change in policyholders' surplus\nV7 Investment yield\nV8 Investment assets to policyholders' surplus\nV9 Return on total assets (ROA)\nV10 Loan & other investment to policyholders' surplus\nV11 Loss reserve & unpaid losses to policyholders' surplus\nV12 Capitalization ratio\nV13 Auto lines net written premium to total net written premium\n\nAfter we analyzed the distribution of the training data, we\nfound that the distribution of the data set was imbalanced,\nas shown in Table 2. The classification of data with\nimbalanced class distribution has posed a significant\ndrawback on the performance of most standard classifiers,\nwhich assume a relatively balanced class distribution and\nequal misclassification costs [20]. Many techniques were\nproposed to solve this problem, for example, re-sampling\nmethods for the balancing the data set, modification of\nexisting learning algorithms, measuring the classifier\nperformance in imbalance domains, relationship between\nclass imbalance, and other data complexity characteristics\n[21].\n\nTo attack the imbalanced data set problem, we employ the\nstandard resample technique to produce a new random set\nof data by sampling with replacement. The distribution on\nthe data sets after applying resample techniques is\npresented in Table 4. In this study, we use the ordinal\nclass classifier which employs the DTL algorithm as the\nbase classifier.\nFigure 1 shows the classification process.

Conclusions\nFrom the experiment setting and results reported in the\nprevious section, the results indicate that the obtained model\ncan solve the problems of the multi-class classification and\nalso the imbalanced data set. In this study, we employ the\nordinal class classifier to solve the multi-class problem, so\nthat our model can classify the solvency condition of Thai\n\n\fNon-life insurance companies into four cases, strong,\nmoderate, weak, and insolvency. To attack the problem of\nimbalanced data set, we use the standard resample technique\nwhich can highly improve the accuracy of the minority class\nwhich is the class that we are interested. Our final model are\nuseful for insurance regulators, auditors, investors,\nmanagement, policy holders, and related party to determine\nthe priority for further examinations as an early warning\nsystem. In our further research, we will apply the ensemble\nmethods and standard classifiers proposed here to better\nimprove the imbalanced data set problem.\n\nReferences\n[1] P.
