It is characterized as the curve of smallest genus realizing\nthe upper bound 84(g \u2212 1) on the order of a group of conformal automorphisms of a curve of genus g > 1,\ngiven by A. Hurwitz [13] in 1893. Around the same time, A. Wiman characterized the curves w2 = z 2g+1 \u2212 1\nand w2 = z(z 2g \u2212 1), g > 1, as the unique curves of genus g admitting cyclic automorphism groups of largest\nand second-largest possible order (4g + 2 and 4g, respectively) [36]. Two other curve families, identified\nmuch later, share a similar characterization: the Accola-Maclachlan and Kulkarni curves of genus g realize\nthe sharp lower bound 8g + 8 on the maximum order of an automorphism group of a curve of genus g > 1\n([1], [29], [23]). Collectively, we call these curves (together with one other exceptional curve discovered by\nWiman) the classical curves. Further details are given in Section 5.2.\nThe triangular tesselation on the Klein quartic is an example of a map, or imbedding of a finite connected\ngraph on a compact oriented surface, so that the complement is a union of simply connected faces. Maps\nare a special type of dessin d'enfant (\"child's drawing\") as defined by G. Grothendieck [10]. The topological\nsurface underlying a map has a canonical complex structure, making it a compact Riemann surface, and\nhence, a complex algebraic curve (see, e.g., [35], [16]). It turns out that any curve with a map (or dessin)\nadmits a Bely\u0131\u0306 function (a meromorphic function with at most three critical values) and is therefore, by\nBely\u0131\u0306's theorem ([2], [22], [37]), defined over an algebraic number field. Conversely, any curve defined over a\nnumber field admits a map which is geometric in the sense that its edges are geodesics in a canonical complex\nstructure [17]. The absolute Galois group acts faithfully on maps (or dessins) via its action on the coefficients\nof the equations defining the curves and the formulae for the Bely\u0131\u0306 functions [18].\nIn this paper, we show that the classical curves can be uniformly characterized as curves admitting a\nstrictly edge-transitive one-vertex map whose automorphisms are a proper subgroup of the full group of\nconformal automorphisms of the curve (see Section 2.1 for definitions). The main result is Theorem 6.3.\nThe paper includes three expository sections (Sections 2, 3 and 5) and two sections containing new results\n(Sections 4 and 6). Section 2 gives the definition of a map and its automorphisms purely combinatorially\nin terms of permutation groups. Section 3 constructs the canonical complex structure on a surface with\n1\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 14J50, 14H57, 11G32\n\n1\n\n\fa map, making the map geometric and its automorphisms conformal. Section 5 discusses conformal group\nactions on Riemann surfaces, and the question of whether and how a finite cyclic action can extend to\nthe action of a larger group. Details on the classical curves, all of which admit large cyclic automorphism\ngroups, are also given there. In Section 4 we enumerate equivalence classes of one-vertex maps according\nto the size of the group of map automorphisms, staying within the purely combinatorical framework. In\nSection 6 we specialize to regular and strictly edge-transitive one-vertex maps, whose automorphism groups\nare, respectively, maximal and second-maximal (with respect to the number of edges). The classical curves\n(and some others) arise when the second-maximal group of map automorphisms is not the full group of\nconformal automorphisms of the curve (Theorem 6.3).\nOne-face or unicellular maps are the duals of one-vertex maps, and have been studied from various points\nof view. They were enumerated by means of a recurrence relation on the number of maps of a given genus\n[11], and more recently by a different combinatorial identity [8]. Neither enumeration gives any explicit\ninformation about the automorphism groups, as ours does. In [33], D. Singerman characterized Riemann\nsurfaces admitting strictly edge-transitive uniform unicellular dessins, a less general class of maps than the\none we focus on. One-face maps of genus 0 (plane trees) have been extensively studied (see, e.g., [18], [25] and\nreferences therein), since they are easily visualized, and the action of the absolute Galois group, restricted to\nthese simple dessins, remains faithful. The final paragraph of the paper summarizes the work most closely\nrelated to our main result.\nThe recent book [25] is an excellent general reference on dessins; see also [17]. The first complete exposition\nof the theory of maps on surfaces was given by G.A. Jones and D. Singerman [15], and it remains an excellent\nreference. The paper [30] describes an analytic approach to maps using quadratic differentials.\n\n2\n\nMaps and permutation groups\n\nA map is a finite connected graph embedded on a compact oriented surface so that the complement is a union\nof simply connected faces. Loops and multiple edges are allowed. A directed edge is called a dart, symbolized\nby an arrowhead on the edge pointing toward one of the two incident vertices. We usually assume that all\nedges carry two darts, although it is possible and sometimes useful to relax this assumption. The set of darts\npointing toward a given vertex receives a counter-clockwise cyclic ordering from the orientation of the ambient\nsurface. If the map has k edges, and the darts are labelled arbitrarily with the symbols 0, 1, . . . , 2k \u2212 1, the\ncyclic ordering of the darts at each vertex gives a collection of disjoint cycles in the symmetric group S2k ; we\ndefine x \u2208 S2k to be the product of these cycles. We define y \u2208 S2k to be the permutation that interchanges\nthe dart labels on each edge. With the assumption that all edges carry two darts, y is a free involution. The\nmonodromy group GM of a map M is the subgroup hx, yi \u2264 S2k . By the connectedness of the underlying\ngraph, GM acts transitively on the darts.\nFigure 1 shows a map with k = 24 darts imbedded on the torus of modulus e\u03c0i/3 . (The lower left corner\nof the parallelogram is 0 \u2208 C and the upper left is e\u03c0i/3 .) There are 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 4 hexagonal\nfaces. Evidently\nx = (0 1 2) (3 4 5) (6 7 8) (9 10 11) (12 13 14) (15 16 17) (18 19 20) (21 22 23),\ny = (0 10) (1 17) (2 3) (4 6) (5 13) (7 23) (8 9) (11 19) (12 22) (14 15) (16 18) (20 21) \u2208 S24 .\nWe will revisit this example throughout the paper.\nFor any map with monodromy group hx, yi, the cycles of (xy)\u22121 = yx\u22121 describe closed oriented circuits\n(paths of darts arranged tip-to-tail) which bound the faces of the map. To see this, start with a dart \u03b41\npointing toward a given vertex v1 . x\u22121 \u03b41 is the next dart after \u03b41 in the clockwise cyclic ordering of the\ndarts pointing toward v1 . Let \u03b42 = yx\u22121 \u03b41 , the \"reversal\" of x\u22121 \u03b41 , pointing along the same edge, toward an\nadjacent vertex, v2 . (It may happen that v2 = v1 ; in this case the edge carrying \u03b42 is a loop at v1 ). Repeat\nthe process staring with \u03b42 , obtaining \u03b43 = yx\u22121 \u03b42 , pointing toward an adjacent vertex, v3 (possibly v3 = v2\nor = v1 ). After finitely many steps, say, n \u2265 1 of them, \u03b4n = \u03b41 , that is, we arrive again at the original\ndart. At no step does an edge incident with a vertex vi intervene between the edge carrying \u03b4i and the edge\ncarrying \u03b4i+1 . Thus the circuit \u03b41 , \u03b42 , . . . , \u03b4n\u22121 traverses the boundary of a unique face of M, namely, the\nface which is on the left from the point of a view of a traveller following the circuit. With this convention,\neach dart belongs to the boundary of a unique face. For the map in Figure 1,\nyx\u22121 = (0 3 13 22 20 11) (1 10 8 23 12 15) (2 17 18 21 7 4) (5 6 9 19 16 14) \u2208 S24 .\n2\n\n\fA\n\nB\n\nbc\n\nA\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\n17\n\n23\n\nb\n\n15\n\nb\n\n21\n16\n\n22\n\n14\n\n20\n\nb\n\n12\n\nb\n\n18\n13\n\nC\n\n19\n\nbc\n\nD\nbc\n\nbc\n\nb\n\n3\n\nb\n\n9\n4\n\n10\n8\n\n2\n0\n\nb\n\n6\n\nA\n\nb\n\n7\n\n1\nbc\n\nC\n\n11\n\n5\n\nbc\n\nbc\n\nB\n\nA\n\nFigure 1: A map on a torus. Opposite sides of the parallelogram are identified.\n\nThe four cycles specify the boundaries of the hexagonal faces centered at C, A, B, D, respectively.\nThe topological genus g of the surface underlying a map is easily determined from the formula for the\nEuler characteristic, 2g \u2212 2 = |{vertices}| \u2212 |{edges}| + |{faces}|, where the number of vertices is the number\nof cycles in x, and the number of faces is the number of cycles in (xy)\u22121 (1-cycles are counted). The number\nof edges is the number of 2-cycles in a free involution on 2k symbols, that is, k.\nIf there is a permutation in S2k which simultaneously conjugates the monodromy generators x1 , y1 \u2208 GM1\nof a map M1 to, respectively, the monodromy generators x2 , y2 \u2208 GM2 of another map M2 , we say that the\ngroups GM1 , GM2 are strongly conjugate.\nDefinition 1. Two maps M1 , M2 are equivalent if their monodromy groups are strongly conjugate.\nA map M is (non-trivially) equivalent to itself if and only if there is a permutation in S2k , not contained\nin GM , which commutes with both monodromy generators and hence centralizes GM . Since conjugate\nsubgroups have conjugate centralizers, the automorphism group of a map,\nAut(M) = CentS2k (GM ) = {\u03c0 \u2208 S2k | \u03c0g = g\u03c0 for all g \u2208 GM },\nis well-defined (up to isomorphism) on equivalence classes of maps.\nThe equivalence relation we adopt is appropriate for studying the faithful action of the absolute Galois\ngroup on maps: if maps from distinct equivalence classes are in the same Galois orbit, their monodromy\ngroups are conjugate but not strongly conjugate (see, e.g., [18]). We do not pursue this since we focus on\nmaps on surfaces defined over Q, which are fixed by the Galois action.\n\n2.1\n\nRegular and edge-transitive maps\n\nDefinition 2. A map M has type (n, r), if n is the lcm (least common multiple) of the vertex valencies and\nr is the lcm of the face valencies. (The valence of a face is the number of darts in its bounding circuit.) The\nmap is uniform if all vertices have valence equal to n and all faces have valence equal to r.\nThe map M is called regular if Aut(M) acts transitively on the set D of darts. This implies that the map\nis uniform, and in particular, that every dart has the same local incidence relations. The map in Figure 1\nis uniform of type (3, 6). It is also regular: Aut(M) \u2243 Z6 \u22c9 (Z2 \u2295 Z2 ), where Z2 \u2295 Z2 is the factor group\ngenerated by translations carrying A 7\u2192 B and A 7\u2192 C, modulo the normal subgroup generated by their\nsquares. The study of regular maps goes back at least to Klein and Dyck, and perhaps as far as Kepler (see\n[7], Chapter 8); for more recent work see, e.g., [6], [19].\nA map for which Aut(M) is transitive on edges (but not necessarily on darts) is called edge-transitive. In\nthis case there are at most two sets of local incidence relations since a dart might not be equivalent (via an\nautomorphism) to its reversal. Thus there are at most two distinct face-valences, and at most two distinct\nvertex valences. We call a map which is edge-transitive but not regular strictly edge transitive (\"half-regular\"\nin [33]).\n3\n\n\f3\n\nUniformization of maps and surfaces\n\nLet G = GM = hx, yi be the monodromy group of a map M of type (n, r). Let \u0393 = \u0393(n, r) be the group\nwith presentation\n\u0393(n, r) = h\u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 | \u03be1n = \u03be22 = \u03be3r = \u03be1 \u03be2 \u03be3 = 1i.\n(1)\nThere is an obvious surjective homomorphism \u03b8 : \u0393 \u2192 G, defined by\n\u03b8 : \u03be1 7\u2192 x,\n\n\u03be2 7\u2192 y,\n\n\u03be3 7\u2192 (xy)\u22121 .\n\n(2)\n\nFor \u03b4 \u2208 D, where D is the set of darts of M, let G\u03b4 denote the isotropy subgroup {g \u2208 G | \u03b4g = \u03b4}.\nDefinition 3. The subgroup M = \u03b8\u22121 (G\u03b4 ) \u2264 \u0393, is called the canonical map subgroup for M.\nTransitivity of the permutation group (G, D) implies all G\u03b4 are conjugate, so M is well-defined (up to\nconjugacy) independent of \u03b4.

These groups act properly\ndiscontinuously by conformal isometries on one of the three simply connected Riemann surfaces: the Riemann\nsphere (P1 ), the complex plane (C), or the Poincar\u00e9 upper half plane (H). This fact allows us to obtain a\ncanonical complex structure on the topological surface underlying a map.\nA group \u039b = \u039b(\u03c3) with signature \u03c3 = (h; r1 , r2 , . . . , rs ) has presentation\n\u039b(\u03c3) = ha1 , b1 , . . . , ah , bh , \u03be1 , . . . \u03bes | \u03be1r1 = * * * = \u03besrs =\n\nh\nY\n\ni=1\n\n\u22121\na\u22121\ni bi ab\n\ns\nY\n\n\u03bej = 1i,\n\n(3)\n\nj=1\n\nand acts by conformal isometries on P1 , C, or H, depending on whether the number\n\u03bc(\u03c3) = 2h \u2212 2 +\n\ns\nX\ni=1\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\u0001\nri\n\nis, respectively, negative, 0, or positive.

If \u2206 is any subgroup of finite index n in \u039b(\u03c3), then \u2206 is also a group with\nsignature \u03c3 \u2032 and the Riemann-Hurwitz relation states that \u03bc(\u03c3 \u2032 ) = n\u03bc(\u03c3).\nThe orbit space U/\u039b, where U denotes P1 , C, or H as appropriate, is a compact Riemann surface of genus\nh with s distinguished points, over which the projection U \u2192 U/\u039b branches. The complex structure on U/\u039b\nis the one which makes the branched covering map U \u2192 U/\u039b holomorphic. The uniformization theorem\nof Klein, Poincar\u00e9 and Koebe states that every compact surface of genus h can be obtained in this way;\nmoreover one may choose the uniformizing group \u039b to be a surface group, so that there are no distinguished\npoints, and the covering is regular.\nWhen \u03bc(\u03c3) > 0, which is the case except for finitely many signatures, \u039b(\u03c3) is a co-compact Fuchsian\ngroup (discrete subgroup of PSL(2, R) containing no parabolic elements) and 2\u03c0\u03bc(\u03c3) is the hyperbolic area\nof a fundamental domain for the action of \u039b(\u03c3) on H. The normalizer NPSL(2,R) (\u039b) of a Fuchsian group \u039b is\nitself a Fuchsian group, containing \u039b with finite index.\nLemma 3.2. The automorphism group of H/\u039b is isomorphic to the finite quotient group NPSL(2,R) (\u039b)/\u039b.\nFor proofs and further details, see, e.g., [15], [16], [20].\n\n3.2\n\nThe canonical Riemann surface of a map\n\nLet M \u2264 \u0393 = \u0393(n, r) be the canonical map subgroup of a map M of type (n, r). Since M is a group with\nsignature, the quotient space U/M is a compact Riemann surface, known as the canonical Riemann surface\nfor M. The canonical Riemann surface contains the map M geometrically, that is, the edges of M are\ngeodesics, faces are regular geodesic polygons, and face-centers are well-defined points. To see this, we pass\nto the universal map M\u0302n,r of type (n, r). M\u0302n,r is a regular map imbedded on one of the simply connected\nRiemann surfaces U = P1 , C, or H. It can be constructed as follows. Let T \u2208 U be a geodesic triangle\nwith vertices a, b, c, at which the interior angles are \u03c0/n, \u03c0/2, \u03c0/r respectively (see Figure 2). Reflections in\nthe sides of T generate a discrete group of isometries of U whose sense-preserving subgroup (of index 2) is\nisomorphic to \u0393 = \u0393(n, r). The generators \u03be1 , \u03be2 , \u03be3 \u2208 \u0393 correspond to the rotations about a, b, c through\nangles of, respectively, 2\u03c0/n, \u03c0, 2\u03c0/r; the product of the three rotations (considered as a product of six side\nreflections) is easily seen to be trivial. Let \u00ea be the geodesic segment ab \u222a \u03be2 (ab), directed toward the vertex\na. The map with dart set D\u0302 = {\u03b3(\u00ea) | \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393} and vertex set V\u0302 = {\u03b3(a) | \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393} is the universal map M\u0302n,r .\nDarts meet in sets of n at each vertex and the angle between any two consecutive edges is 2\u03c0/n. The faces are\nregular geodesic r-gons centered at the \u0393-images of c. The permutation group (\u0393, D\u0302) is isomorphic to (\u0393, |\u0393|),\nthe right regular representation of \u0393 on itself. Thus the map is regular and Aut(M\u0302n,r ) = Aut(\u0393, |\u0393|) = \u0393.\n1 1 1\nIf the number \u2212 \u2212 is negative, 0, or positive, M\u0302n,r lies on P1 , C, or H, respectively. In the negative\n2 n r\ncase, M\u0302n,r is a central projection of one of the Platonic solids onto the circumscribed sphere; in the positive\ncase, it is one of infinitely many regular tesselations of the hyperbolic plane. In the 0 case, it is a tesselation\nof C by squares, hexagons, or equilateral triangles. (Figure 1 is a portion of M\u03023,6 .) See, e.g., [7].\nThe orbifold map U \u2192 U/M is a local isometry. Hence the image of D\u0302 in the canonical Riemann surface\nU/M is a set of directed geodesic segments. These segments are in bijection with the set |\u0393/M | of right cosets\n5\n\n\fof M in \u0393, and \u0393 acts by right multiplication on |\u0393/M |. If \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 fixes every coset, it belongs to the core M \u2217\nof M in \u0393. Hence the universal map M\u0302n,r projects to a map M\u0302n,r /M on U/M \u2013 the promised geometric\nmap \u2013 with monodromy group (\u0393/M \u2217 , |\u0393/M |). With Lemma 3.1, we conclude that every map of type (n, r)\nis a quotient of the universal map M\u0302n,r , by a subgroup M of finite index in the group \u0393 = \u0393(n, r), and may\nbe assumed to lie on its canonical Riemann surface.\nThe general theory of covering spaces specializes to the category of maps of type (n, r). Thus, if M1\nand M2 are two finite maps with canonical map subgroups M1 , M2 \u2264 \u0393 = \u0393(n, r), then M1 is a finite\ncovering of M2 if and only if M1 is conjugate within \u0393 to a subgroup of finite index in M2 . In particular, if\nM2 = N\u0393 (M1 ), the normalizer of M1 in \u0393, then Aut(M1 ) \u2243 M2 /M1 . This leads to the following Lemma.\nLemma 3.3. Let M be a map of type (n, r) with canonical map subgroup M \u2264 \u0393 = \u0393(n, r). Then Aut(M) \u2264\nAut(X), where X = U/M is the canonical Riemann surface for M, and Aut(X) is the group of conformal\nautomorphisms of X.\nProof. Aut(M) is isomorphic to N\u0393 (M )/M . Since \u0393, M and N\u0393 (M ) are discrete subgroups of Isom+ (U),\nthe sense-preserving isometries of U,\nNIsom+ (U ) (M )\nN\u0393 (M )\n\u2264\n= Aut( U /M ).\nM\nM\nThe equality on the right is a consequence of Lemma 3.2 if U = H.\nIn the local geometry of the canonical Riemann surface, an automorphism \u03b1 \u2208 Aut(M) which preserves\na face acts as a rotation about the fixed face-center through an angle 2\u03c0/r\u2032 , where r\u2032 is a divisor of the\nface-valence (and a divisor of r if the type is (n, r)). Similarly, if \u03b1 preserves an edge while transposing\nits darts, the geometric action is a rotation through an angle \u03c0 about the fixed edge midpoint. These are\nconsequences of corresponding facts about the universal map M\u0302n,r , together with the fact that the covering\nprojection U \u2192 U/M is a local isometry. See [15].\n\n4\n\nOne-vertex maps with automorphisms\n\nWe now enumerate one-vertex maps, up to equivalence, according to the size of their automorphism groups.\nLet M be a map with one vertex and k edges. The monodromy generator x \u2208 S2k is a 2k-cycle specifying\nthe counterclockwise cyclic ordering of the darts (arbitrarily labelled 0, 1, 2, . . . , 2k \u2212 1) around the vertex.\nThe other monodromy generator, y \u2208 S2k , is a free involution whose k disjoint transpositions specify how the\ndarts pair off into edges. Since all 2k-cycles are conjugate in S2k , we may assume, up to map equivalence,\nthat x is the standard 2k-cycle\n(0 1 2 . . . 2k \u2212 1).\n(4)\nThen M is determined by the free involution y, which can be chosen in\nk\u22121\nY\u0012\ni=0\n\n\u0013\n2k \u2212 2i\n= (2k \u2212 1) * (2k \u2212 3) * * * * * 3 * 1 = (2k \u2212 1)!!\n2\n\nways. Figure 3 shows three of the 15 one-vertex maps with three edges.\nThe number of equivalence classes of one-vertex maps with k edges is smaller than (2k \u2212 1)!!, since some\nof the maps have non-trivial automorphisms.\nTheorem 4.1. Let M be a one-vertex map with k edges and monodromy group GM = hx, yi, where x is a\n2k-cycle and and y is a free involution. Then: (i) Aut(M) \u2264 hxi \u2243 Z2k . (ii) If Aut(M) = hxp i, p a divisor of\n2k, the monodromy groups hx, ys i, where ys = x\u2212s yxs , s = 0, . . . p\u22121, determine distinct but equivalent maps.\nConversely, if M is equivalent to M\u2032 with monodromy group GM\u2032 = hx, y \u2032 i, then Aut(M) \u2243 Aut(M\u2032 ) = hxp i\nfor some divisor p of 2k, and y \u2032 = ys for some s, 0 \u2264 s \u2264 p \u2212 1.\nProof. The centralizer of GM is contained in the centralizer of each of its generators; in particular, it is\ncontained in the centralizer of hxi. The latter is an abelian transitive permutation group which, by a wellknown result in the theory of permutation groups, is its own centralizer (see, e.g., [34], Section 10.3). It follows\nthat Aut(M) \u2264 hxi \u2243 Z2k . Now suppose p is a divisor of 2k and Aut(M) = hxp i. The permutations xs , s =\n1, . . . , p\u22121 do not commute with y (otherwise they would be automorphisms of M), hence there are p distinct\n6\n\n\ffree involutions ys = x\u2212s yxs , s = 0, 1, . . . , p \u2212 1, belonging to strongly conjugate monodromy groups hx, ys i,\ndetermining distinct but equivalent maps. Conversely, if M is equivalent to M\u2032 , the monodromy groups\nGM = hx, yi and GM\u2032 = hx, y \u2032 i are strongly conjugate, with conjugate centralizers and hence isomorphic\nautomorphism groups. Since both automorphism groups are contained in hxi, Aut(M) = Aut(M\u2032 ) = hxp i\nfor some divisor p of 2k. By strong conjugacy of GM and GM\u2032 , there exists a permutation \u03c3 \u2208 S2k , such\nthat \u03c3 \u22121 x\u03c3 = x and \u03c3 \u22121 y\u03c3 = y \u2032 . In particular \u03c3 \u2208 CentS2k (hxi) = hxi. If y \u2032 6= y, \u03c3 \u2208 hxi \\ hxp i. Thus\n\u03c3 = xd , for d a non-multiple of p. If d > p, \u03c3 \u22121 y\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2032 \u22121 y\u03c3 \u2032 , where \u03c3 \u2032 = xd\u2212p , since xp commutes with y.\nIt follows that all possible y \u2032 are obtained by taking \u03c3 \u2208 {x, x2 , . . . , xp\u22121 }.\n\n4.1\n\nFree involutions with prescribed commutation property\n\nIf x \u2208 S2k is a 2k-cycle, and p is a divisor of 2k, then xp is a product of p cycles of length d = 2k/p. Assuming\nx is the standard 2k-cycle (4), the cycles are\nCj = (j j + p . . . j + 2k \u2212 p),\n\nj = 0, 1, . . . , p \u2212 1.\n\n(5)\n\nLet cy : S2k \u2192 S2k denote conjugation by a free involution y \u2208 S2k . If y commutes with xp , then hcy i \u2243 Z2\nblock-permutes the p d-cycles at (5), while preserving their internal cyclic orderings. The permutation cy\neither preserves a given cycle or interchanges two distinct cycles in a block-orbit of length 2. Suppose cy\npreserves the cycle Cj , as well as its internal cyclic order. Then for some positive integer t and for every\nsymbol a \u2208 Cj , cy (a) = a + tp (mod 2k). Because cy has order 2, 2tp \u2261 0 (mod 2k) or, equivalently, tp \u2261 0\n(mod k), which has the unique (mod k) solution t = k/p = d/2, implying that d is even. On the other hand,\nif cy : S2k \u2192 S2k interchanges two cycles Ci and Cj , i < j, preserving their internal cyclic orders, there exists\nan integer t \u2265 0 such that every symbol i + ap \u2208 Ci , is mapped to cy (i + ap) = j + (a + t)p, and, reciprocally,\nevery symbol j + bp \u2208 Cj , is mapped to cy (j + bp) = (i + (b \u2212 t)p (all symbols are reduced mod 2k). The\nshift parameter t is not uniquely determined, but may take any value 0, 1, . . . , d \u2212 1. There is no requirement\nthat d be even. It follows that a free involution commuting with xp is uniquely determined by the following\ndata:\n\u2022 the set of cycles Cj fixed by cy (empty if d = 2k/p is odd);\n\u2022 the (possibly empty) set of cycle pairs [Ci , Cj ], i < j, transposed by cy ;\n\u2022 for each transposed pair, a choice of shift parameter t, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 d \u2212 1.\nLet q = \u230ap/2\u230b, the greatest integer less than or equal to p/2. If cy transposes m \u2264 q cycle pairs, those pairs\ncan be chosen, up to reordering, in\n\u0012 \u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013m\np!\n1\n1 p\np\u22122\np \u2212 (2m \u2212 2)\n...\n=\n2\n2\nm! 2\n2\nm!(p \u2212 2m)!\nways. Each pair requires a choice of shift parameter from among 0, 1, 2, . . . , d \u2212 1, so the number of choices\nis multiplied by dm . If d is odd, there are no unpaired cycles and m = p/2 = q, an integer since p is even. If\nd is even, unpaired cycles are possible so the number of choices is a sum over all possible m. This yields the\nfollowing Lemma.\nLemma 4.2. Let \u03bd p be the number of free involutions in S2k commuting with xp , where x is a 2k-cycle and\np a divisor of 2k.

Let \u03bdp be the number\nP of one-vertex maps with k edges whose full automorphism group is hx i,\np a divisor of 2k.

Let p\u2032 be any proper divisor of p. If p is a prime, p\u2032 = 1 and \u03bd 1 = 1. Hence \u03bdp = \u03bd p \u2212 1 = \u03bd p \u2212 \u03c31 ,\nproving the theorem in this case. If p is not prime, p = p\u2032 p\u01eb11 p\u01eb22 . . . p\u01ebss , where at least one of the \u01ebi > 0.\nReordering the pi if necessary we may assume that the first t \u2264 s of the \u01ebi > 0, while the remaining\ns \u2212 t are 0. Hence, without loss of generality, p = p\u2032 p\u01eb11 p\u01eb22 . . . p\u01ebt t , with all \u01ebi > 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , t. Each\n\u2032\nmap with\ngroup hxp i contributes 1 to \u03bd p ; it suffices to show that such a map contributes\nPs automorphism\n\u22121 to i=1 (\u22121)i \u03c3i , so that its total contribution to the formula in the theorem is 0. We use a standard\ninclusion/exclusion argument. If t = 1, the map contributes \u22121 to \u2212\u03c31 and 0 to the remaining summands. If\nt = 2, the map contributes \u22122 to \u2212\u03c31 , 1 to \u03c32 , and 0 to the remaining summands. In general, for arbitrary\nt \u2264 s, the contribution is \u2212( 1t ) to \u2212\u03c31 , ( 2t ) to \u03c32 , etc. It follows from the binomial theorem that the total\ncontribution is\n\u0012\u0013\nt\nX\nt\n= (1 \u2212 1)t = 0.\n(\u22121)i\n1+\ni\ni=1\n\nThus the formula counts only those maps whose automorphism group is equal to hxp i.\n\nCorollary 4.4.

The surface X is conformally equivalent to U/Mg , where U is\nthe universal covering space. G is isomorphic to \u039b(\u03c3)/Mg , and the Riemann-Hurwitz relation requires\n2g \u2212 2 = |G|\u03bc(\u03c3). We say that G acts in genus g with signature \u03c3.\nDefinition 4. A \u03c3-generating vector for a finite group G is an ordered set of elements, one for each generator\nof \u039b(\u03c3), which generate G and fulfill the corresponding relations in \u039b(\u03c3) (and possible other relations).\nA \u03c3-generating vector for G determines a surface kernel epimorphism \u03c1 satisfying (7), and conversely. Hence\nLemma 5.1. G acts in genus g with signature \u03c3 if and only if G has a \u03c3-generating vector.\nLet \u03c3 = (0; n, m, r), so that \u039b(\u03c3) is a triangle group , and let G = Zn . By a general theorem of Maclachlan\n[28] (see also Harvey [12]), an abelian group of order n has an (0; n, m, r)-generating vector if an only if\nlcm(m, r) = n. We establish a normal form for such a generating vector. Let Zn = hx | xn = 1i, and let\nhxa , xb , xc i be a (0; n, m, r)-generating vector. Then a + b + c \u2261 0 (mod n) since the product of the elements\nmust be the identity. For the elements to have the appropriate orders, n/(a, n) = n, n/(b, n) = m, and\nn/(c, n) = r, where ( , ) denotes the gcd (greatest common divisor) of two integers. If \u03c1 in (7) is postcomposed with an automorphism of G, an equivalent generating vector, specifying a topologically equivalent\naction, is obtained (see [3], Prop. 2.2). Hence we may assume a = 1. Writing Zn additively, with the\ngenerator 1, we define\nDefinition 5. The normal form for an (0; n, m, r)-generating vector for Zn = h{0, 1, . . . , n}, +i is\nh 1, b, c i,\n\n5.1\n\n1 + b + c \u2261 0 (mod n),\n\nn/(b, n) = m,\n\nn/(c, n) = r.\n\n(8)\n\nFinite maximality and extendability\n\nDefinition 6. A group with signature is finitely maximal if it is not a subgroup of finite index in any other\ngroup with signature.\nIf \u039b(\u03c3) in (7) is finitely maximal, then \u039b(\u03c3)/Mg is necessarily the full automorphism group of X = U/Mg .\nFinite maximality is not generally a property of the abstract group \u039b(\u03c3), but depends on the particular\nimbedding of the group in Isom+ (U). However, there are some pairs of signatures (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ) such that every\nimbedding of a group \u039b(\u03c3) with signature \u03c3 in Isom+ (U) extends to an imbedding of an overgroup \u039b(\u03c3 \u2032 ).\nSignature pairs of this type were considered by Greenberg in [9], and fully classified by Singerman [32].\nFor each such pair, there arises a delicate problem in finite group theory: for each subgroup-overgroup pair\n(G, G\u2032 ), with [G\u2032 : G] = [\u039b(\u03c3 \u2032 ) : \u039b(\u03c3)], and such that G\u2032 has a \u03c3 \u2032 -generating vector and G has a \u03c3-generating\nvector, determine conditions under which the G\u2032 -action is an extension of the G-action on the same surface.\nEquivalently, determine conditions under which the surface-kernel epimorphism \u03c1 in (7) is the restriction of a\nsurface-kernel epimorphism (with the same kernel) \u03c1\u2032 : \u039b(\u03c3 \u2032 ) \u2192 G\u2032 . This problem is treated comprehensively\nin the papers [5] and [4]. The signature pairs (\u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 ) where both signatures are triangular and the first is\ncyclic-admissable \u2013 that is, \u039b(\u03c3) admits surface-kernel epimorphisms onto a cyclic G \u2013 are given in Table 1,\nwhich uses the case nomenclature established in [5]. The index [\u039b(\u03c3 \u2032 ) : \u039b(\u03c3)] = [G\u2032 : G] is easily computed\nusing the Riemann-Hurwitz relation and the fact that Mg is a subgroup of both groups. In cases N6 and N8\nin the table, \u039b(\u03c3) is a normal subgroup of \u039b(\u03c3 \u2032 ). We give complete descriptions of these cases below. The\nnecessary numerical conditions on k are implicit but not stated in [5].\nLemma 5.2 (Case N6). A Zk action with signature (0; k, k, k) has an extension of type N6 to a G action\nwith signature (0; 3, 3, k) only if 32 \u2224 k and p \u2261 1 (mod 3) for every prime divisor p 6= 3 of k. The numerical\nconditions imply that Zk has an automorphism \u03b2 of order 3, acting non-trivially on each p-Sylow subgroup,\np 6= 3. Then G \u2243 Z3 \u22c9\u03b2 Zk and the normal form of the generating vector for the Zk action is h1, \u03b2(1), \u03b2 2 (1)i.\n\n9\n\n\fCase\nN6\nN8\nT1\nT4\nT8\nT9\nT10\n\n\u03c3\u2032\n(0; 3, 3, k)\n(0; 2, k, 2u)\n(0; 2, 3, 7)\n(0; 2, 3, 8)\n(0; 2, 3, 4k)\n(0; 2, 4, 2k)\n(0; 2, 3, 3k)\n\n\u03c3\n(0; k, k, k)\n(0; k, k, u)\n(0; 7, 7, 7)\n(0; 8, 8, 4)\n(0; 4k, 4k, k)\n(0; 2k, 2k, k)\n(0; 3k, k, 3)\n\n[\u039b(\u03c3 \u2032 ) : \u039b(\u03c3)]\n3\n2\n24\n12\n6\n4\n4\n\nConditions\nk\u22654\nu|k, k \u2265 3\nk\u22652\nk\u22653\nk\u22653\n\nTable 1: Cyclic-admissible signatures (\u03c3) and possible extensions (\u03c3 \u2032 )\nProof. Since Zk is a normal subgroup, G has the semi-direct product structure Z3 \u22c9\u03b2 Zk , where \u03b2 is a\n(possibly trivial) automorphism of Zk of order a divisor of 3. In addition, any non-trivial subgroup of G,\nbeing a homomorphic image of the group with signature (0; 3, 3, k), is generated by at most two elements of\norder 3. Let p G denote a p-Sylow subgroup of G. 3 G has the structure Z3 \u22c9\u03b2 Z3s , s \u2265 0, but since it is\ngenerated by a most two elements of order 3, s \u2264 1. Hence 32 \u2224 k. For a prime divisor p 6= 3 of k, p G is cyclic,\nand \u03b2 induces an automorphism \u03b2p on p G. The subgroup Z3 \u22c9\u03b2p (p G) \u2264 G is generated by two elements of\norder 3 only if \u03b2p is a non-trivial automorphism of order 3. This implies that p \u2261 1 (mod 3), and yields the\nstated necessary conditions on k. If 1 is the additive generator of p G, then the element 1 + \u03b2p (1) + \u03b2p2 (1) \u2208p G\nis fixed by \u03b2p and hence must be the identity (equivalently, 1 + \u03b2p (1) + \u03b2p2 (1) \u2261 0 (mod |p G|)). Now, Zk\nis the direct sum of its p-Sylow subgroups; hence \u03b2 = \u2295p \u03b2p , where the sum is over the prime divisors of\nk. (\u03b2p is trivial if p = 3.) It follows that h\u03b2i is a subgroup of order 3 in the automorphism group of Zk\nwhich acts non-trivially on each p-Sylow subgroup, p 6= 3. Taking 1 as the additive generator of Zk , we have\n1 + \u03b2(1) + \u03b2 2 (1) \u2261 0 (mod k). Thus h1, \u03b2(1), \u03b2 2 (1)i is the normal form of a (0; k, k, k) generating vector for\na Zk action extendable to a G action.\nLemma 5.3 (Case N8). A Zk action with signature (0; k, k, u) has an extension of type N8 to a G action\nwith signature (0; 2, k, 2u) if and only if either\n1. k is odd, G \u2243 Z2k , u = k, and the normal form of the Zk generating vector is h1, 1, k \u2212 2i;\n2. k is even, G = Z2 \u2295 Zk , u = k/2, and the normal form of the Zk generating vector is h1, 1, k \u2212 2i;\n3. k 6= 2, 4, ps , 2ps , (p an odd prime), G \u2243 Z2 \u22c9\u03b1 Zk , (non-abelian, non-dihedral), where \u03b1 is an\nautomorphism of Zk of order 2, \u03b1(1) 6= \u22121, and the normal form of the Zk generating vector is\nh1, \u03b1(1), k \u2212 (1 + \u03b1(1))i.\nProof. The group G has the semi-direct product structure Z2 \u22c9\u03b1 Zk , where \u03b1 is a (possibly trivial) automorphism of Zk of order a divisor of 2. If G is non-abelian, \u03b1 is non-trivial and the generating vector is of the\nform h1, \u03b1(1), ci. \u03b1(1) 6= \u22121, for then c = 0, and u = 1. Such an \u03b1 exists if and only if k 6= 2, 4, ps , 2ps , (p\nan odd prime) [14]. G has the (non-dihedral) semi-direct product structure Z2 \u22c9\u03b1 Zk . If G is abelian, \u03b1 is\ntrivial, and by Maclalchlan's lcm condition [28], either u = k and G \u2243 Z2k , or u = k/2 and G = Z2 \u2295 Zk .\n\n5.2\n\nCyclic actions on the classical curves\n\nThe classical curves admit automorphism groups which are \"large\" with respect to the genus g; in particular,\nthe maximal cyclic subgroups of automorphisms have order at least \u2265 2g + 1. The paper [24] gives a precise\ndefinition of \"large,\" and has interesting points of contact with our work. (See, e.g., Section 3 of [24], where\ncyclic group actions with a fixed point are described in terms of side-pairings of hyperbolic polygons; being\none-face maps, the polygons can be viewed as the duals of one-vertex maps in which side-pairings correspond\nto dart-pairings on edges.)\nThe Wiman curves of genus g > 1 are\nw2 = z 2g+1 \u2212 1\n2\n\nw = z(z\n3\n\n2g\n\n\u2212 1)\n\n4\n\nw = z + 1 (g = 3)\n\n10\n\n(type I)\n(type II)\n(type III).\n\n\fTheir maximal cyclic automorphism groups are\n(w, z) 7\u2192 (\u2212w, ze2\u03c0i/2g+1 ) of order 4g + 2\n(w, z) 7\u2192 (we\n(w, z) 7\u2192 (we\n\n\u03c0i/2g\n\n2\u03c0i/3\n\n, ze\n\n, ze\n\n\u03c0i/g\n\n2\u03c0i/4\n\n)\n\nof order 4g\n\n(type I)\n\n(type II)\n\n) of order 4g = 12 (type III).\n\nSignatures for the cyclic actions can be deduced by analyzing the ramifications of the branched covering\nprojection Pz : (w, z) 7\u2192 z. For example, for the Wiman curve of type I, Pz : (w, z) 7\u2192 z has degree 4g + 2\nwith ramification of order 2g + 1 over z = 0, order 4g + 2 over z = \u221e, and order 2 over the (2g + 1)st roots\nof unity. The unique normal form of a generating vector for Z4g+2 with a (0; 4g + 2, 2g + 1, 2) signature is\neasily seen to be h1, 2g, 2g + 1i. By similar arguments one sees that the signatures of the Type II and III\nactions are (0; 4g, 4g, 2) and (0; 12, 4, 3), respectively. Corresponding generating vectors, unique in normal\nform, are given in Table 2. The type I signature is finitely maximal (it does not appear in Table 1), so Z4g+2\nis the full automorphism group of the type I curve. The type II and type III signatures are not: the cyclic\nactions extend to larger conformal actions according to cases N8 and T10 of Table 1, with k = 4g, k = 4,\nrespectively. The full2 automorphism groups are\nSD8g = ha, b | a4g = b2 = 1,\n\nb\u22121 ab = a2g\u22121 i\n\nH48 = hKulkarni's group of order 48i\n\nacting with signature (0; 2, 4g, 4) (type II)\n\nacting with signature (0; 2, 3, 12) (type III).\n\nA presentation of H48 is given in [24].\nIn the late 1960's R.D.M. Accola [1] and C. Maclachlan [29] independently showed that the genus g curve\nwith equation w2 = z 2g+2 \u2212 1 has full automorphism group\nAM8g+8 = ha, b | a2g+2 = b4 = 1,\n\n(ab)2 = [a, b2 ] = 1i,\n\nof order 8g + 8, and that, for infinitely many g \u2265 2, this curve realizes the maximal order of an automorphism\ngroup of a surface of genus g. (A. M. Macbeath had shown in 1961 [27] that the Hurwitz bound 84(g \u2212 1)\nis not attained for infinite sequences of genera.) Thus, for every g \u2265 2, there exists a surface Xg of genus\ng such that |Aut(Xg )| \u2265 8g + 8, and the bound is sharp for infinitely many g. If g \u2261 \u22121 (mod 4), there\nis a second surface of genus g, identified by Kulkarni in 1991 [23], having full automorphism group of order\n8g + 8, acting with the same signature as AM8g+8 . The full3 automorphism group of the Kulkarni surface is\nK8g+8 = ha, b | a2g+2 = b4 = 1,\n\n(ab)2 = 1,\n\nb2 ab2 = ag+2 i.\n\nBoth AM8g+8 and K8g+8 act with signature (0; 2, 4, 2g + 2) and contain the cyclic subgroup ha | a2g+2 = 1i\nof index 4. The distinct normal forms of the generating vectors for the cyclic actions, given in Table 2, show\nthat the Accola-Maclachlan and Kulkarni curves, when they exist in the same genus, are distinct. The index\n4 extensions to AM8g+8 and K8g+8 realize Case T9 in Table 1.\nThe Klein quartic is uniquely determined by the normal form of the generating vector for its maximal\ncyclic group of automorphisms (Z7 ) given in Table 2. This action has an index 3 extension (type N6) to the\ngroup Z3 \u22c9\u03b2 Z7 , \u03b2(1) = 2, and a further extension (type T1) to PSL2 (7). It is worth noting that there is\nanother Z7 action in genus 3, with the same signature (0; 7, 7, 7) as the one determining the Klein quartic.\nThis action has generating vector h1, 1, 5i and determines the Wiman curve of type I via an N8 extension,\nwith u = k = 2g + 1 = 7.\n\n6\n\nThe classical curves and edge-transitive one-vertex maps\n\nWe have seen that a one-vertex map M with k edges has Aut(M) = hxp i \u2264 Z2k = hxi, where p is a divisor\nof 2k. If M is edge-transitive, Aut(M) must have at least k elements, hence p = 1 or p = 2. If p = 1, M is\nregular. If p = 2, M is strictly edge transitive, i.e., edge transitive but not regular.\nThe following theorem (stated in terms of unifacial dessins) was proved in [33], and completely characterizes regular one-vertex maps.\nTheorem 6.1. Let M be a regular, one-vertex map on a surface X of genus g > 0. Then X is the Wiman\ncurve of type I and M has 2g + 1 edges, or X is the Wiman curve of type II and M has 2g edges.\n2 If\n3 If\n\ng = 2, SD16 extends to an action of GL2 (Z3 ), of order 48, with signature (0; 2, 3, 8) (Case T11 in [5]).\ng = 3, K32 extends to an action by a group of order 96 acting with signature (0; 2, 3, 8) (Case T11 in [5]).\n\n11\n\n\fCurve\nWiman type I\nWiman type II\nAccola-Maclachlan\nKulkarni\nWiman type III\nKlein\n\nGroup\nZ4g+2\nZ4g\nZ2g+2\nZ2g+2\nZ12\nZ7\n\nSignature\n(0; 4g + 2, 2g + 1, 2)\n(0; 4g, 4g, 2)\n(0; 2g + 2, 2g + 2, g + 1)\n(0; 2g + 2, 2g + 2, g + 1)\n(0; 12, 4 , 3)\n(0; 7, 7, 7)\n\nGen.

The type II map on the right has one face, centered at A, and lies on the elliptic curve of\nmodulus i. These curves are the natural genus 1 analogues of the Wiman curves of type I, II , characterized\n(up to conformal equivalence) by admitting an automorphism of order greater than 2 (6, 4, respectively)\nwhich fix a point. Note that the map in Figure 1 also lies on the type I elliptic curve.\n\n6.1\n\nStrictly edge-transitive one-vertex maps\n\nIf M is strictly edge-transitive with k edges, the edge midpoints are permuted regularly in a k-cycle (with\ntrivial isotropy subgroup) and the face centers fall into two orbits, each having isotropy subgroup of order equal\nto the corresponding face-valence. By Wiman's bound on the order of an automorphism (or an automorphism\nwith a fixed point if g = 1), k \u2264 4g + 2. k = 4g + 1 is not possible, by the Riemann-Hurwitz relation.\nTheorem 6.2. Let M be strictly edge-transitive one-vertex map on a surface X of genus g \u2265 1. The action\nof Aut(M) \u2243 Zk has signature and generating vector\nZk\n\n(0; k, l1 , l2 )\n\nh1, t, k \u2212 (t + 1)i,\n\nl1 = k/(t, k), l2 = k/(t + 1, k),\n\n(9)\n\nfor some t, 0 < t < k/2, t 6= (k \u2212 1)/2. The notation ( , ) indicates the gcd (greatest common divisor) of two\nintegers.\nProof. In the monodromy group GM = hx, yi, the free involution y commutes with x2 but not with x, hence\nit is obtained from a pairing of the two k-cycles\nC0 = (0 2 . . . 2k \u2212 2)\n\nand\n\nC1 = (1 3 . . . 2k \u2212 1)\n\nwith a shift parameter t, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 k \u2212 1 (cf. Section 4.1). If k is odd, t = (k \u2212 1)/2 is excluded, since in that\ncase, y = xk and the map would be regular. The permutation (xy)\u22121 = yx\u22121 consists of cycles of at most\ntwo different lengths. If a cycle of yx\u22121 contains an odd symbol 2c + 1, then\n2c + 1\n\nx\u22121\n\n7\u2192\n\ny\n\n2c\n\n7\u2192\n\n2c + 2t + 1,\n\nwhich implies that the cycle has length l1 where l1 is the minimal positive integer for which 2l1 t \u2261 0 (mod 2k).\nIt follows that l1 = k/(t, k). Similarly, if a cycle contains an even symbol 2c, then\n2c\n\nx\u22121\n\n7\u2192\n\ny\n\n2c \u2212 1\n\n7\u2192\n12\n\n2c \u2212 2 \u2212 2t,\n\n\fwhich implies that the cycle has length l2 , where l2 is the minimal positive integer such that \u2212l2 (2 + 2t) \u2261 0\n(mod 2k). This yields l2 = k/(t + 1, k). It follows that (xy)\u22121 is a product of (t, k) cycles of length l1\nand (t + 1, k) cycles of length l2 . The single vertex of M is fixed by Aut(M). The edge midpoints are\npermuted regularly in a k-cycle, and the centers of the two face types are permuted in orbits of lengths (t, k)\nand (t + 1, k), with isotropy subgroups of orders l1 and l2 , respectively. It follows that Aut(M) acts with\nsignature (0; k, l1 , l2 ). By Theorem 4.1, hx, yi is strongly conjugate to hx, y1 i, where y1 = x\u22121 yx. Moreover\ny1 is obtained from y by replacing the shift parameter t with the shift parameter k \u2212 (t + 1). We note that\nsince (t + 1, k) = (k \u2212 (t + 1), k), the signature of the Zk action is not changed if t is replaced by k \u2212 (t + 1). It\nfollows that up to map equivalence, we may assume t < k/2. If t = 0, the signature reduces to (0; k, k) which\nplaces the map (and the Zk action) on the Riemann sphere. The lcm of l1 and l2 is k, so a (k, l1 , l2 )-generating\nvector for Zk exists and may be taken in the normal form h1, t, k \u2212 (t + 1)i (cf. (8)).\nIn most cases, if a curve X of genus g > 1 has a strictly edge-transitive, one-vertex map M, then\nAut( M) = Aut( X). The exceptions are characterized in our final theorem, below. If AutM = Aut( X), an\nequation for X is wk = z k/l1 (z \u2212 1)k/l2 , where Aut(M) \u2243 Zk is generated by (w, z) 7\u2192 (w, e2\u03c0i/k z).\nTheorem 6.3. Let M be a strictly edge-transitive one-vertex map with k edges, where Aut( M) = Zk\nhas signature and generating vector (9). Let X be the canonical Riemann surface of genus g > 1. If\nAut( X) > Aut( M), then\n1. k = 12, t = 3, and X is the Wiman type III curve;\n2. k = 2g + 1, t = 1, and X is the Wiman type I curve;\n3. k = 2g + 2, t = 1, and X is the Accola-Maclachlan curve;\n4. k = 2g + 1, t = \u03b2(1), and Aut(X) \u2243 Z3 \u22c9\u03b2 Zk as in Lemma 5.2; except\n\u2022 if k = 7, t = \u03b2(1) = 2, X is the Klein quartic.\n5. 2g + 2 \u2264 k \u2264 4g, t = \u03b1(1), and Aut(X) \u2243 Z2 \u22c9\u03b1 Zk as in Lemma 5.3; except\n\u2022 if k = 2g + 2, g \u2261 \u22121 (mod 4), \u03b1(1) = g + 2, X is the Kulkarni curve; or\n\u2022 if k = 12 or 24, g = 4 or 10, \u03b1(1) = 7 or 19 (resp.), Aut(X) contains Z2 \u22c9\u03b1 Zk with index 3.\nIn case 5, with k = 4g and \u03b1(1) = 2g \u2212 1, Z2 \u22c9\u03b1 Zk \u2243 SD8g and X is the Wiman curve of type II.\nProof. If Aut( X) > Aut( M), the signature in (9) must coincide with one of the cyclic-admissible signatures\n\u03c3 in Table 1. For an extension of type N6, by the Riemann-Hurwitz relation, k = 2g + 1; if g = 3, the N6\nextension is subsumed by the T1 extension, which yields the Klein quartic. For an extension of type N8, by\nthe Riemann-Hurwitz relation, k = 2g(u/u \u2212 1). For an abelian extension, there are two possibilities: (i)\nu = k/2 (equivalently, k = 2g + 2) and t = 1; or (ii) u = k (equivalently, k = 2g + 1) and t = 1. In the\nfirst case we obtain the Zk action (see Table 2) which determines the Accola-Maclachlan curve. (The N8\nextension to Z2 \u2295 Z2g+2 is subsumed by the T9 extension.) In the second case, we obtain the cyclic action\nwhich determines the Wiman curve of type I, extending to Z4g+2 . For a non-abelian extension of type N8,\nu \u2264 k/2 (otherwise the extension would be cyclic of order 2k), hence 2g + 2 \u2264 k \u2264 4g. Both the lower\nand upper bounds, which occur when l2 = k/2, l2 = 2, respectively, satisfy the necessary conditions on k\ngiven in Lemma 5.3 for a nonabelian, non-dihedral extension to Z2 \u22c9\u03b1 Zk . If g \u2261 \u22121 (mod 4), \u03b1(1) = g + 2\ndetermines an automorphism of Z2g+2 of order 2 since (g + 2)2 \u2261 g 2 \u2261 1 (mod 2g + 2). Taking k = 2g + 2,\nwe have k \u2212 (1 + \u03b1(1)) = g \u2212 1 which has has order g + 1 (mod k) since (g + 1)(g \u2212 1) = (2g + 2)(g \u2212 1)/2 \u2261 0\n(mod k). This yields the Zk action which determines the Kulkarni surface. (The N8 extension is subsumed\nby the T9 extension, or by the T4 extension if g = 3). In the last two exceptional cases (k = 12, 24) the N8\nextension is subsumed by the T8 extension. The Wiman type III curve arises from the T10 extension.\nSubsets of the curves mentioned in Theorem 6.3 have been characterized in ways related to our characterization. A. Meleko\u011flu and D. Singerman ([31], Section 6) characterized the Wiman curves of type I and\nII, and the Accola-Maclachlan curves (all of which are hyperelliptic) as the unique curves of genus g > 1\nadmitting double-star maps. These are two-sheeted covers (via the hyperelliptic involution) of a one-vertex\nmap on the sphere having only free edges (carrying a single dart). We note that double-star maps are\nthe \"exceptional\" ribbon graphs of [30] (Definition 1.9). Meleko\u011flu and Singerman ([31], Theorems 8.2 and\n13\n\n\f8.3) also characterized the Accola-Maclachlan and Wiman type II curves as the unique Platonic M - and\n(M \u2212 1)-surfaces, respectively. These are curves of genus g > 1 admitting an anti-conformal involution with\nthe maximal and second-maximal (g + 1, resp., g) number of fixed simple closed curves. D. Singerman ([33],\nTheorem 6.2) classified the surfaces admitting uniform strictly edge-transitive one-vertex maps; this is the\nspecial case l1 = l2 in our Theorem 6.2.\n\nReferences\n[1] Accola, R.D.M., On the number of automorphisms of a closed Riemann surface, Trans.
