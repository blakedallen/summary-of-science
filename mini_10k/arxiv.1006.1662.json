By the equivalence theorem [1], it interacts with a strength\n\u221a\n1/ f which is much stronger than the Planck suppressed couplings of the transverse gravitino,\nand is therefore very well described by the gravity-decoupled limit of a massless Goldstone\nfermion. An example of such a situation is provided by gauge mediation where, however, the\ntypical scale of supersymmetry breaking is expected to be a few orders of magnitude higher\nthan the soft breaking terms of the Standard Model (SM) superparticles, due to their double\nsuppression by the loop factor and by the messengers mass.\nIn this work, we perform a model independent analysis of the low energy consequences\n\u221a\nof a light goldstino by treating f as a free parameter, that can be as low as a few times\nthe scale of soft breaking terms which we denote generically msof t . Furthermore, we will\nassume that all extra states (that may exist beyond those of the MSSM) are heavier than\n\u221a\nf . In such a framework, there are two generic energy regimes that can be studied: (i): at\nTeV energies, comparable (or higher) than msof t , one has the usual MSSM together with a\ngoldstino; (ii): at low energies, lower than all sparticle masses, one is left just with a goldstino\ncoupled to the SM fields. In both cases, the goldstino effective interactions can be determined\nby non-linear supersymmetry. In the first case, it couples to ordinary supermultiplets of linear\nsupersymmetry, while in the second case the superparticles have been integrated out.\nThe self-interactions of the goldstino are given by the famous Volkov-Akulov action [2].\nTheir geometric method gives also a universal coupling to matter through its energy momentum tensor, of the form (1/f 2 )T\u03bc\u03bd t\u03bc\u03bd , where T\u03bc\u03bd , t\u03bc\u03bd are the stress tensors of matter and of\n(free) goldstino, respectively [3, 4]. It was realized however that this coupling is not the most\ngeneral invariant under non-linear supersymmetry [4, 5, 6]. General invariant couplings can be\nderived using two different superfield formulations. One of them promotes any ordinary field\nto a superfield by introducing a modified superspace that takes into account the non-linear\nsupersymmetry transformations of the goldstino [7, 8, 9]. The other uses the formalism of constrained superfields: these are usual superfields, but are subject to constraints that eliminate\nthe superpartners in terms of the light degrees of freedom and the goldstino [10, 11, 12, 13].\nIn this work, we use the method of constrained superfields in order to determine the general\ncouplings of the goldstino to MSSM superfields, focusing in the first energy region mentioned\n\u221a\nabove E \u223c msof t < f . The only constrained superfield is then that of the goldstino Xnl ,\n\n2 = 0, which couples to MSSM superfields via the corresponding\nsatisfying the constraint Xnl\n\n1\n\n\fsoft terms: the recipe is to replace the spurion S \u2261 msof t \u03b8 2 by (msof t /f )Xnl and solve for\nits F-auxiliary component, as usual, in order to determine all effective interactions that can\n\nbe expanded in inverse power series of f . In the second energy region, lower than msof t , the\nsuperpartners can be integrated out (this can be done by additional constraints on the MSSM\nsuperfields [13]), and one has the goldstino coupled to SM fields only. In this case, it was found\nthat the dominant effective operators are of dimension-six [9] and can induce an important\ninvisible decay width of the Higgs boson, if the goldstino carries lepton number [14]. For a\nrelated effective approach to these problems, goldstino couplings and applications see [15, 16].\nObviously, the goldstino couplings to MSSM become important if the supersymmetry\n(SUSY) breaking scale is low. On the other hand, validity of the effective Lagrangian requires\nthat f be higher than the soft breaking terms, so that m2sof t /f is a good expansion parameter.\nIt turns out that the most important effects of these couplings are in the Higgs sector. In\nparticular, the quartic Higgs coupling is increased by a term proportional to the ratio of visible\nto hidden sector SUSY breaking, with two important consequences: (i) it can increase the\ntree-level value of the lightest Higgs mass that can then reach and cross the LEP bound2 of\n114.4 GeV [22]; (ii) it can alleviate the fine tuning of the electroweak scale in MSSM due to the\nrelatively high experimental bounds on msof t and large quantum corrections usually required\nin MSSM to satisfy the LEP bound. Additional effects that we investigate relate to the\ngoldstino-induced couplings in the MSSM Lagrangian, upon integration of the sgoldstino. All\ncouplings goldstino - MSSM fields are computed and these can be used for phenomenological\nstudies. As an example we show that for a light neutralino, the SM-like Higgs can decay into\na goldstino (which is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP)) and the lightest neutralino\n(next to LSP (NLSP) in this case), with a decay rate that can be comparable to the SM\npartial decay h0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3. A similar decay of Z is possible, which provides a lower bound on\n\u221a\nf \u2248 700 GeV. Other decays of the Higgs and Z bosons into pairs of goldstinos are possible,\nbut they have additional (1/f ) suppression, with little impact on the allowed parameter space.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses general issues in non-linear realizations of supersymmetry and goldstino couplings. Section 3 presents the \"non-linear\" MSSM\nmodel obtained by the general coupling of the MSSM to goldstino, using the method described above. Section 4 presents the new couplings of the model, not present in MSSM, some\nof which are dimension-four in fields, suppressed by up to the second power of 1/f . Section 5\nanalyzes the implications for the Higgs masses. Section 6 presents other phenomenological consequences, such as the implications for the fine-tuning of the electroweak scale, some\ninteresting limits, and the invisible decays of the Higgs and Z bosons together with their\nconstraints. Finally, Section 7 contains our concluding remarks.\n2\n\nFor other possibilities to increase the Higgs mass in effective models see [15, 17, 18, 19, 21].\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nNon-linear realizations and constrained goldstino superfield\n\nAn important role in constructing a non-linear supersymmetric version of the MSSM is played\nby the goldstino chiral superfield (SM gauge singlet) Xnl . One can use the component fields\nformalism to describe the corresponding Volkov-Akulov action. However, one can use the\nmore convenient superfield formalism, endowed with constraints; for the goldstino superfield\n2 = 0 [10, 11, 12, 13]. One can start with the Lagrangian\nthis constraint is Xnl\n\u001b\n\u001aZ\nZ\nhi\ni\n2\n4\n\u2020\nd \u03b8 f X + h.c. = |\u2202\u03bc \u03c6X |2 +FX\u2020 FX + \u03c8 X \u03c3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c8X + f FX +h.c. (1)\nLX = d \u03b8 X X +\n2\n\nwith the aforementioned constraint. This constraint is solved by\nXnl = \u03c6X +\n\n\u221a\n\n2 \u03b8\u03c8X + \u03b8\u03b8 FX ,\n\nwith\n\n\u03c6X =\n\n\u03c8X \u03c8X\n2 FX\n\n(2)\n\nwhich, when used in eq.(1) recovers [13] the Volkov-Akulov Lagrangian. After using the\nequations of motion FX = \u2212f + .... where f (that can be chosen real) is the hidden sector\n\nSUSY breaking scale. Therefore, in the infrared description of the SUSY breaking (which is\nmodel independent), the scalar component (sgoldstino) becomes a function of the goldstino.\nTo find the goldstino couplings to matter fields (discussed for the MSSM in the next\nsection), consider first a supersymmetric theory with chiral multiplets \u03a6i \u2261 (\u03c6i , \u03c8i , Fi ) and\n\nvector multiplets V \u2261 (Aa\u03bc , \u03bba , D a ) coupled in a general way to Xnl :\n\nh\ni \u001aZ\nh\n\u2020\n\u2020\nd2 \u03b8 f Xnl + W (\u03a6i )\nd4 \u03b8 Xnl\nXnl + \u03a6\u2020i (eV \u03a6)i \u2212 (m2i /f 2 ) Xnl\nXnl \u03a6\u2020i (eV \u03a6)i +\n\u001b\ni\n\u0011\nAijk\nBij\n2 m\u03bb\n1\u0010\n\u03b1\n+\n1+\n(3)\nXnl \u03a6i \u03a6j +\nXnl \u03a6i \u03a6j \u03a6k +\nXnl Tr W W\u03b1 + h.c. ,\n2f\n6f\n4\nf\n\nL =\n\nZ\n\nwhere m2i , Bij , Aijk are soft terms for the scalars and m\u03bb is the gaugino mass. From this, one\ncan find the Goldstino (\u03c8X ) couplings to ordinary matter/gauge superfields. These couplings\ncan be checked to be equivalent to those obtained by the equivalence theorem [1], from a\ntheory with the corresponding explicit soft breaking, in which the goldstino couples as:\n(1/f ) \u2202 \u03bc \u03c8X J\u03bc = \u2212(1/f ) \u03c8X \u2202 \u03bc J\u03bc + (total space-time derivative),\n\n(4)\n\nHere J\u03bc is the supercurrent of the theory corresponding to that in (3) in which the goldstino\nis essentially replaced by the spurion, with the corresponding explicit soft breaking terms:\nL\n\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nZ\nh\n= d \u03b8 1\u2212\n\u03a6)i + d2 \u03b8 W (\u03a6i )\u2212 (1/2) Bij \u03b8 2 \u03a6i \u03a6j \u2212(1/6) Aijk \u03b8 2 \u03a6i \u03a6j \u03a6k\ni\n1\n(5)\n(1 \u2212 2m\u03bb \u03b8 2 ) Tr W \u03b1 W\u03b1 + h.c. ,\n+\n4\n4\n\nh\n\n2\nm2i \u03b8 2 \u03b8\n\ni\n\n\u03a6\u2020i (eV\n\n3\n\n\fWith this, eq.(4) shows that, on-shell, all goldstino couplings are proportional to soft terms.\nIndeed, the supercurrent of (5) is given by (with D\u03bc,ij = \u03b4ij \u2202\u03bc + i g Aa\u03bc Tija )\n1\ni\na\na\na\nJ\u03b1\u03bc = \u2212[\u03c3 \u03bd \u03c3 \u03bc \u03c8i ]\u03b1 [D\u03bd, ij \u03c6j ]\u2020 + i [\u03c3 \u03bc \u03c8 i ]\u03b1 Fi \u2212 \u221a [\u03c3 \u03bd \u03c3 \u03c1 \u03c3 \u03bc \u03bb ]\u03b1 F\u03bd\u03c1\n+ \u221a D a [\u03c3 \u03bc \u03bb ]\u03b1\n2 2\n2\n\n(6)\n\ni\nm\u03bb h\na\n+ D a \u03bba\u03b1 .\n\u2202\u03bc J\u03b1\u03bc = \u03c8i,\u03b1 (m2i \u03c6\u2020 j + Bij \u03c6j + (1/2)Aijk \u03c6j \u03c6k ) + \u221a (\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd )\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bba\u03b2 F\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n(7)\n\nso\n\nFrom (4), (7) one then recovers the couplings with one goldstino. However, the superfield\nformalism in (3) has the advantage that is easier to use when evaluating couplings with more\nthan one goldstino, by simply writing all effective operators (involving Xnl ) to a fixed order in\n1/f [13]. It is more difficult to find these from (5) and in Section 3 we use the former method.\nFinally, in addition to usual SUSY and goldstino couplings eq.(3) also brings new goldstinoindependent couplings induced by eliminating FX .

When applied to\nMSSM, this brings in particular new corrections to the Higgs scalar potential (see later).\n\n3\n\nThe \"non-linear\" MSSM.\n\nWe apply the above method to couple the constrained superfield Xnl to the SUSY part of\nthe MSSM, to find the \"non-linear\" supersymmetry version of MSSM [13]. We stress that\nat energy scales below msof t , similar constraints can be applied to the MSSM superfields\nthemselves, corresponding to integrating out the corresponding superpartners. Here, the only\ndifference from the ordinary MSSM is in the supersymmetry breaking sector. Supersymmetry\nis broken spontaneously via a vacuum expectation value (VEV) of FX , fixed by its equation\nof motion (see later). The Lagrangian of the \"non-linear MSSM\" model is [13],\nL = L0 + LX + LH + Lm + LAB + Lg\n\n(9)\n\nLet us detail these terms.

This requires solving for F\u03c6 of matter fields up to and including 1/f 2 terms and for\nFX up to and including 1/f 3 terms (due to its leading contribution which is -f ). Doing so, in\nthe final Lagrangian no kinetic mixing is present at this order.

Our analysis below is then valid\n\nfor |c1,2 ||h1,2 |2 \u226a 1.

The first term in the last line is a new term, absent in MSSM\n(generated by eliminating FX of Xnl ). Its effects for phenomenology will be analyzed later.\nThe ignored higher order terms in 1/f involve non-renormalizable h61,2 interactions in V .\n\n6\n\n\f4\n\nNew couplings in the Lagrangian.\n\nIn this section we compute the new interactions induced by Lagrangian (9), which are not\npresent in the MSSM. Many of the new couplings are actually dimension-four in fields, with\na (dimensionless) f -dependent coupling. The couplings are important in the case of a low\nSUSY breaking scale in the hidden-sector and a light gravitino scenario. Some of the new\ncouplings also involve the goldstino field and are relevant for phenomenology.\nAs mentioned earlier in Section 3, from the SUSY breaking part of the Lagrangian only\nterms up to and including 1/f 2 were kept in the total Lagrangian given by equations (1) to\n(15).

From the neutral Higgs part of potential one finds the masses of the CP even\nand CP odd Higgs fields. Exact values (in 1/f ) can be found (see the Appendix), but since\neq. (17) is valid up to 1/f 4 terms, it is sufficient to present the expressions of the Higgs masses\nthat are valid up to this order.

The increase of mh is significant even at larger f , if one increases \u03bc, as seen in (c), (d).\nIn figs.

In (c) tan \u03b2 = 50 while in (d) tan \u03b2 = 5, showing a milder dependence on tan \u03b2 than in MSSM.\nFor tan \u03b2 \u2265 10 there is little difference from (c). In (e), (f) the expansion coefficients are shown, for\nmA = [90, 650] GeV with steps of 10 GeV, \u03bc = 900 GeV, tan \u03b2 = 50; they are always less than unity,\n\u221a\neven at larger values of f or \u03bc shown in (c), (d), as required for a convergent expansion.\n\nFigure 1: The tree-level Higgs masses (in GeV) and expansion coefficients as functions of\n\n11\n\n\fSome simple numerical examples are relevant for the size of the corrections to the Higgs\nmasses, relative to their MSSM values. The largest correction to mh for large tan \u03b2 is dom\u221a\ninated by \u03bc and f (eq. (33)). For example, if (\u03bc/ f )2 = (1/2.25)2 \u2248 1/5, v = 246 GeV,\n\u221a\nwith \u03bc = 900 GeV then f = 2 TeV, giving mh = 114.4 GeV. Other examples are: (\u03bc = 1.2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nTeV, f = 2.7 TeV) and (\u03bc = 2.6 TeV, f = 6 TeV), leading to mh = 114.4 GeV (with\n\u221a\n(\u03bc/ f )2 \u2248 1/5). Smaller \u03bc \u2248 600 GeV can still allow mh just above the LEP bound if\n\u221a\n\u221a\nf = 1.35 TeV, for similar value for (\u03bc/ f )2 = 1/5 and for the rest of the parameters. This\nshows that one can have a classical value of mh near or marginally above the LEP bound and\nlarger than the classical MSSM value (= mZ ). The plots in Figure 1 illustrate better the value\n\u221a\n\u221a\nof mh and mH for various values of f . For f in the region of 1.5 TeV to 7 TeV the LEP\n\u221a\n\u221a\nbound is satisfied for mh , while at larger f the MSSM case is recovered. By varying f\nour results can interpolate between low and high scale (in the hidden sector) SUSY breaking.\nQuantum corrections increase mh further, just as in the MSSM.\nRegarding the usual MSSM tree-level flat direction |h01 | = |h02 | one can show that the\n\npotential in this direction can have a minimum for the case (not considered in MSSM) of\n\nm21 + m22 + 2|\u03bc|2 < 2|B|, equal to Vm = f 2 \u2212 (1/4)f 2 (m21 + m22 + 2|\u03bc|2 + 2B)2 /(m21 + m22 + B)2 .\n\nCompared to the usual MSSM minimum, the former can be situated above it only for values\n\nof f which do not comply with the original assumptions of m21,2 , |B| < f . On the other hand,\n\nthe case with Vm situated below the MSSM minimum does not allow one to recover the MSSM\n\nground state in the decoupling limit of large f , and in conclusion the \"flat\" direction is not\nof physical interest here.\n\n6\n\nOther phenomenological implications.\n\n6.1\n\nFine-tuning of the electroweak scale\n\nThe increase of mh , at the classical level, beyond the MSSM tree-level bound (mZ ) and the\npresence of the new quartic couplings of the Higgs fields also have implications for the fine\ntuning. In the MSSM the smallness of the effective quartic coupling \u03bb (fixed by the gauge\nsector) is at the origin of an increased amount of fine tuning of the electroweak scale for large\nsoft masses. For soft masses significantly larger than the electroweak (EW) scale, (also needed\nto increase the MSSM value for mh above LEP bound via quantum corrections), fine tuning\nincreases rapidly5 and may become a potential problem (sometimes referred to as the \"little\nhierarchy\" problem). Let us see why in the present model this problem is alleviated. One can\n5\n\nTwo-loop MSSM fine tuning [23] is minimized at mh \u223c 115 GeV (consistent with EW and dark matter\nconstraints); however, beyond this value, fine tuning increases exponentially with mh .\n\n12\n\n\fwrite v 2 = \u2212m2 /\u03bb where\ni\n1\ng12 + g22 h\ncos2 2\u03b2 + \u03b4 sin4 \u03b2 + 2 m21 cos2 \u03b2 + m22 sin2 \u03b2 + (1/2) B sin 2\u03b2\n8\nf\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2261 (|\u03bc| + m1 ) cos \u03b2 + (|\u03bc| + m2 ) sin2 \u03b2 + B sin 2\u03b2\n\n\u03bb \u2261\nm2\n\n2\n\n(34)\n\nThe first term in \u03bb is due to MSSM only, while the second one, which is positive, is due to\nthe new quartic Higgs terms in (17). Here \u03b4 accounts for the top/stop quantum effects to\n|h2 |4 term in the potential, which becomes (1 + \u03b4) (g12 + g22 )/8 |h2 |4 ; usually \u03b4 \u223c O(1) (ignoring\n\ncouplings other than top Yukawa). This quantum effect is only included for a comparison to\nthe new quartic Higgs term. The important point to note is that a larger \u03bb gives a suppression\nin the fine tuning measure \u2206:\n\u2206=\n\n\u2202 ln v 2\n\u2202 ln(\u2212m2 /\u03bb)\n=\n,\n\u2202 ln p\n\u2202 ln p\n\np = A, B, m20 , \u03bc2 , m2\u03bbi .\n\n(35)\n\nHere p is an MSSM parameter with respect to which fine tuning is evaluated. In the large\ntan \u03b2 limit, the fine tuning of the electroweak scale becomes (see the Appendix in [19]):\n\u2206=\u2212\n\n(|\u03bc|2 + m22 )\u2032\n+ O(1/ tan \u03b2),\nv 2 m42 /f 2 + (1 + \u03b4) m2Z /2\n\n(|\u03bc|2 + m2 )\u2032 \u2261\n\n\u2202(|\u03bc|2 + m22 )\n\u2202 ln p\n\n(36)\n\nFor small tan \u03b2 a similar result is obtained in which one replaces m2 by m1 . The first term in\ndenominator comes from the new correction to the effective quartic coupling \u03bb. Larger soft\nmasses m1,2 increase \u03bb and this can actually reduce fine tuning, see the denominator in \u2206.\nTherefore, in this case heavier superpartners do not necessarily bring an increased fine tuning\namount (as it usually happens in the MSSM). The only limitation here is the size of the ratio\nm21,2 /f \u2264 1 for convergence of the nonlinear formalism. In the limit this coefficient approaches\n\nits upper limit (say \u223c 1/3), the two contributions in the denominator have comparable size\n\n(for \u03b4 \u223c 1 and v = 246 GeV) and fine tuning is reduced by a factor \u2248 2 from that in the\n\nabsence of the new term in the denominator (i.e. the MSSM case).\n\n6.2\n\nLimiting cases and loop corrections.\n\nSome interesting limits of our \"non-linear\" MSSM model are worth considering. Firstly, in\nthe limit of large f (i.e. large SUSY breaking scale in the hidden sector) and with m1,2 , B\nfixed, the new quartic term in (17) vanishes, while the usual explicit soft SUSY breaking\nterms specific to the Higgs sector remain. This is just the MSSM case. All other couplings\nsuppressed by inverse powers of f are negligible in this limit. Another limiting case is that\nof very small f . For our analysis to be valid, one needs to satisfy the condition B, m21,2 \u2264 f.\n\nWhen f reaches this minimal bound, the new quartic couplings in (17), not present in the\n13\n\n\fMSSM, increase and eventually become closer to unity. The analysis is then less reliable and\nadditional effective contributions in the Lagrangian, suppressed by higher powers like 1/f 4\nand beyond, may become relevant for SUSY breaking effects.\nFinally, one remark regarding the calculation of radiative corrections using (17) and the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). In our case EWSB was assumed to take place by\nappropriate values of m21,2 , B. However, the same EWSB mechanism as in the MSSM is at\nwork here, via quantum corrections to these masses, which near the EW scale turn m22 + \u03bc2\nnegative and trigger radiative EWSB. Indeed, if the loops of the MSSM states are cut off\n\u221a\nas usual at the high GUT scale (well above f ) and with the new Higgs quartic couplings\nregarded as an effective, classical operator, radiative EWSB can take place as in the MSSM.\nA similar example is the case of a MSSM Higgs sector extended with additional effective\nR\noperators of dimension d = 5 such as (1/M ) d2 \u03b8(H1 H2 )2 giving a dimension-four (in fields)\n\ncontribution to the scalar potential V \u2283 (\u03bc/M )h1 h2 (|h1 |2 + |h2 |2 ); this is regarded as an\n\neffective operator and radiative EWSB is implemented as in the MSSM, see for example\n\n[18, 19]. The advantage in our case is that no \"new physics\" (scale M ) is introduced in\n\u221a\nthe visible sector. In both cases, the new scale M and our scale f have comparable values,\nbecause in both cases the increase of mh above the LEP bound is done via couplings depending\n\u221a\non the ratio (\u03bc/M ) [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] or (\u03bc/ f ), respectively.\nIt is interesting to remark that that the loop corrections induced by the (effective) quartic\ncouplings proportional to 1/f 2 in eq.(17), can be under control at large f . Indeed, the\nloop integrals this coupling induces can be quadratically divergent and are then cut-off at\nmomentum p2 \u2264 f ; but the loop effects come with a coupling factor that behaves like 1/f 2 ,\nso overall they will be suppressed like 1/f and can then be under control even at large f (for\na discussion of loop corrections involving the goldstino, see [24]).\n\n6.3\n\nInvisible decays of Higgs and Z bosons.\n\nLet us analyze some implications of the interactions involving the goldstino field, described by\nthe Lagrangian found above. An interesting possibility, for a light enough neutralino, is the\ndecay of the neutral higgses into a goldstino and the lightest neutralino \u03c701 (this is the NLSP,\nwhile goldstino is the LSP). The coupling Higgs-goldstino-neutralino is only suppressed by\n1/f . It arises from the following terms in Lnew and from the terms in the onshell, SUSY part\n\nof usual MSSM Lagrangian (10), hereafter denoted Lonshell\n:\n0\n\ni B h\ni\n1 h 2\nm1 \u03c8X \u03c8h01 h01 \u2217 + m22 \u03c8X \u03c8h02 h02 \u2217 \u2212\n\u03c8X \u03c8h02 h01 + \u03c8X \u03c8h01 h02\nf\nf\nih\ni\nh\nX\nm\u03bbi a\n1\n1\n\u221a D\u0303i \u03c8X \u03bbai \u2212 \u221a g2 \u03bb32 \u2212 g1 \u03bb1 h01 \u2217 \u03c8h0 \u2212 h02 \u2217 \u03c8h0 + h.c.

This is possible\nthrough the goldstino components of the higgsinos \u03c8h01,2 and EW gauginos \u03bb1,2 . The goldstino\ncomponents are found via the equations of motion, after EWSB, to give (see also [13]):\n\u03bc \u03c8h01 =\n\u03bc \u03c8h02 =\n\u03bb1 =\n\n1 \u0010\n\u221a\n\u2212 m22 v2 \u2212 B v1 \u2212\nf 2\n1 \u0010\n\u221a\n\u2212 m21 v1 \u2212 B v2 +\nf 2\n\u22121\n\u221a hD1 i \u03c8X + * * * ,\nf 2\n\n\u0011\n1\nv2 hg2 D23 \u2212 g1 D1 i \u03c8X + * * *\n2\n\u0011\n1\nv1 hg2 D23 \u2212 g1 D1 i \u03c8X + * * *\n2\n\u22121\n\u03bb32 = \u221a hD23 i \u03c8X + * * *\nf 2\n\n(38)\n\nwhich can be further simplified by using the MSSM minimum conditions in the terms multiplied by 1/f (allowed in this approximation). As a consistency check we also showed that\nthe determinant of the neutralino mass matrix (now a 5 \u00d7 5 matrix, to include the Goldstino)\n\nvanishes up to corrections of order O(f \u22124 ). This is consistent with our approximation for\n\nthe Lagrangian, and verifies the existence of a massless Goldstino (ultimately \"eaten\" by the\ngravitino).

(38). The gaugino\n\ncorrection arises after gaugino-goldstino mixing, SUSY and EW symmetry breaking, (as shown\nby m\u03bbi , mZ dependence in \u03b4k\u2032 ) and was not included in previous similar studies [25, 28, 29].\nThe partial decay rate is presented in Figure 2 for various values of \u03bc, mA and m\u03bb1,2 which\n\nare parameters of the model. A larger decay rate requires a light \u03bc \u223c O(100) GeV, when the\nneutralino \u03c701 has a larger higgsino component. At the same time an increase of mh above\n\u221a\nthe LEP bound requires a larger value for \u03bc, close to \u03bc \u2248 700 GeV if f \u2248 1.5 TeV, and\n\u221a\n\u03bc \u2248 850 GeV if f \u2248 2 TeV, see Figure 1 (c). The results in Figure 2 show that the partial\ndecay rate can be significant (\u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 GeV), if we recall that the total SM Higgs decay rate\n\n(for mh \u2248 114 GeV) is about 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 GeV, with a branching ratio of h0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 of 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\n(Figure 2 in [26]). Thus the branching ratio of the process can be close to that of SM h0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3.\n\nThe decay is not very sensitive to tan \u03b2 (Figure 2 (b)), due to the extra contribution (beyond\nMSSM) from the quartic Higgs coupling. It would be interesting to analyze the above decay\nrate at the one-loop level, for a more careful comparison to SM Higgs decays rates.\nAn interesting coupling that is also present in the 1/f order is that of goldstino to Z\u03bc\nboson and to a neutralino. Depending on the relative mass relations, it can bring about a\ndecay of Z\u03bc (\u03c70j ) into \u03c70j (Z\u03bc ) and a goldstino, respectively.

Similar picture is obtained at low tan \u03b2 \u223c 5. (b): As for (a) but with tan \u03b2 = 5.\nCompare against Figure 1 (d). Note that the total SM decay rate, for mh \u223c 114 GeV, is of order 10\u22123 ,\nthus the branching ratio in the above cases becomes comparable to that of SM Higgs going into \u03b3\u03b3\n(see Figure 2 in [26]).\n\nwhere the last term was generated in (25) (i labels the gauge group).

From this, one finds a lower bound for f , which\n17\n\n\fcan be as high as\n\n\u221a\n\nf \u2248 700 GeV for the parameter space considered previously in Figure 1,\n\u221a\nwhile generic values are f \u223c O(400) GeV. Therefore the results for the increase of mh ,\n\u221a\nthat needed a value for f in the TeV region, escape this constraint. This constraint does\nnot apply if the lightest neutralino has a mass larger than mZ , when the opposite decay\n(\u03c7j \u2192 Z \u03c8X ) takes place (this can be arranged for example by a larger m\u03bb1 ).\n\nThere also exists the interesting possibility of an invisible decay of Z\u03bc gauge boson into a\n\npair of goldstino fields, that we review here [6, 13, 15].

For relevant values of f\nabove \u223c1 TeV it turns out that this decay rate is very small relative to other partial decay\n\nrates of the Higgs in the MSSM/SM. For example, for a total decay rate near 10\u22123 GeV (valid\n\nnear a Higgs mass of order O(100) GeV), the branching ratio of this decay mode is well below\n\nthe usual ones and below that of SM Higgs going into \u03b3\u03b3, by a factor \u2248 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22122 .\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work we performed a model independent analysis of the consequences of a light goldstino (of mass \u223c f /MP lanck ) and investigated its couplings to the MSSM superfields. This\n\u221a\nwas done by treating f as a free parameter that can be as low as few times the soft SUSY\nbreaking scale msof t \u223c TeV. The formalism parametrized but did not predict the soft masses,\n\nassumed to be fixed (near the TeV scale) by an otherwise arbitrary SUSY breaking sector.\n\nThe goldstino couplings can be determined by non-linear supersymmetry. Above the msof t\nscale, one has the usual MSSM superfields and the goldstino couples to them, while below this\nscale the SM superpartners are integrated out and one is left with the goldstino coupled to\nSM fields. Both these cases can actually be treated using constrained superfields, where the\nconstraints effectively integrate out the corresponding superpartners in terms of light degrees\n\u221a\nof freedom. For energy regimes E \u223c msof t \u2264 f the only constrained superfield is that\nof goldstino, which couples to the MSSM superfields via the soft terms. Below this energy\n\nregime additional constraints should be imposed on the MSSM superfields themselves. If\n\u221a\nsupersymmetry breaking scale is low f \u223c few TeV, the goldstino couplings to the MSSM\nbecome important. In this paper the leading couplings of all MSSM fields to the goldstino\n\nwere computed to 1/f 2 order, and these can be used for phenomenological studies. In the\nlimit the hidden sector SUSY scale is large with fixed soft masses, the MSSM with explicit\nsoft breaking terms is recovered.\nA significant impact of the aforementioned couplings turned out to be in the Higgs sector\nof the MSSM. It was noticed that the usual MSSM scalar potential acquires additional terms\ninvolving Higgs quartic couplings, with coefficients depending on the ratio of the soft masses\n\u221a\nto the 'hidden' sector SUSY breaking scale ( f ). The presence of these couplings, effectively\ngenerated by integrating out the sgoldstino via its superfield constraint, can have a significant\n19\n\n\fimpact for the Higgs mass and electroweak scale fine-tuning of the MSSM and these were\ninvestigated in detail.\nThe masses of the CP even and CP odd higgses were computed to order 1/f 2 . It was shown\nthat for a low scale of SUSY breaking, the SM-like Higgs mass mh is increased, to reach and\n\u221a\ncross the LEP bound, already at the tree level. For values of f between 1.5 TeV to 7 TeV one\nobtains a value of mh above the LEP bound. The correction increases with \u03bc and can remain\nsignificant even above this energy range. As in the MSSM, quantum corrections increase mh\nfurther. The quartic Higgs coupling was also increased by an additional (effective) contribution\nrelated to the Higgs soft terms. The benefit of this is that the amount of fine tuning of the\nelectroweak scale is then reduced relative to that in the MSSM alone, by a factor comparable\nto (or even larger) than that due to the MSSM quantum corrections to the quartic Higgs\ncoupling. This can be easily understood if we recall that the main source of fine tuning in the\nMSSM is related to the smallness of the MSSM Higgs quartic coupling.\nThe mechanism by which the mass of the SM-like Higgs is increased and the fine-tuning\nreduced has similarities with the method of additional effective operators usually considered\nin the MSSM Higgs sector, to solve these problems. Indeed, using effective operators of\ndimension d = 5 suppressed by \"new physics\" at a scale M , one can increase the Higgs mass\nabove the LEP bound. The advantage in our case is that no new scale is introduced in the\n\u221a\nvisible sector. In both cases the new scales introduced (M or f ) have comparable values,\nbecause in both cases the required increase for mh to be above the LEP bound is done via\n\u221a\ncouplings that depend on the ratio \u03bc/M and \u03bc/ f , respectively.\nThe possibility of an invisible decay of the MSSM lightest Higgs or of Z boson into a\ngoldstino and the (lightest) neutralino was investigated. The decay rate of the Higgs can\nbecome comparable to the h0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 partial decay mode while that of the Z boson was shown\n\u221a\nto bring a lower bound on f \u223c 700 GeV, which is stronger than previous similar bounds\n\u221a\non f . This bound is consistent with that required for a classical increase of mh above the\nLEP bound, and does not apply in the case m\u03c701 > mZ (if for example m\u03bb1 is large enough).\nHigher order (in 1/f ) processes such as Z or Higgs decay into pairs of goldstinos were also\n\u221a\nanalyzed; these were found to be too small to bring constraints on f (for Z case) or subleading to the decay into goldstino-neutralino (for the Higgs case), and in agreement with\nprevious calculations.\nLet us mention that although we treated all MSSM superfields in the linear SUSY real\u221a\nization (i.e. squarks and sleptons lighter than f ), our results on Higgs mass and invisible\ndecays of the Higgs and Z bosons are largely independent of this assumption. Even if the\nquarks and leptons superfields are treated in the nonlinear SUSY realization (i.e. squarks and\nslepton masses are large enough to be integrated out), these results are not changed.\n20\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by the European Commission under contracts PITN-GA2009-237920, MRTN-CT-2006-035863 and ERC Advanced Grant 226371 (\"MassTeV\"), by\nINTAS grant 03-51-6346, by ANR (CNRS-USAR) contract 05-BLAN-007901, by CNRS PICS\nno. 3747 and 4172.
