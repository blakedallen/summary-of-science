The spectrum of position fluctuations evolves from a\nLorentzian shape typical of over-damped systems (beads in liquid solvents), to a damped harmonic\noscillator spectrum showing a resonance peak. In this later under-damped regime, we excite parametric resonance by periodically modulating the trapping power at twice the resonant frequency.\nThe power spectra of position fluctuations are in excellent agreement with the obtained analytical\nsolutions of a parametrically modulated Langevin equation.\n\nParametric resonance provides an efficient and\nstraightforward way to pump energy into an underdamped harmonic oscillator [1]. In general, if the resonance frequency of an oscillator is dependent upon a\nnumber of parameters modulating any of these at twice\nthe natural oscillation frequency parametrically excites\nthe resonance. Such behavior leads to surprising phenomena in the macroscopic world (pumping a swing, stability of vessels, surface waves in vibrated fluids) [2, 3].\nOn the microscopic scale, where stochastic forces become\nimportant, one refers to Brownian parametric oscillators\n[4]. As an example, the parametric driving of Brownian\nsystems has been shown to be at the origin of some peculiar behaviors such as the squeezing of thermal noise\nin Paul traps [5]. Parametrically excited torsional oscillations have also been reported in a single-crystal silicon\nmicroelectromechanical system [6]. What makes parametric resonance useful is that in many cases it is easier\nto modulate a system parameter rather than applying\nan oscillating driving force. Moreover, for finite but low\ndamping rates, we may never reach a stationary state\nwith the damping forces dissipating all of the input power\nand consequently the amplitude of oscillations diverge.\nOptically trapped microparticles constitute a beautiful\nexample of Brownian damped harmonic oscillator (DHO)\nand they are becoming an increasingly common tool for\nthe investigation of different fields of basic and applied\nscience [7]. The possibility of pumping mechanical energy\ninto optically trapped particles could open the way to\nmany applications. In optical tweezers, even though it is\neasy to periodically modulate the laser power, parametric excitation is usually ineffective because of the heavy\ndamping action of the surrounding fluid.\nRecently it has been reported that modulating the\nlaser power at the parametric resonant frequency in an\n\noverdamped system increased the amplitude of mean\nsquared fluctuations [8]. However, these findings have\nbeen difficult to reproduce and are in strong contrast\nwith the prediction of Langevin dynamics [9, 10, 11].\nIn this Letter we show how parametric resonance can\nbe excited in optically trapped water droplets suspended\nin air, due to the reduced damping force. We measure\npower spectra of position fluctuations and find an excellent agreement with the theoretical expectations based\non Langevin dynamics with a parametric forcing.\nThe dynamics of an optically trapped droplet is described by the Langevin equation [12]:\n\u1e8d(t) + \u03a920 x(t) + \u03930 \u1e8b(t) = \u03be(t)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a920 = k/m is the natural angular frequency of\nthe oscillator depending on trap stiffness k and particle\nmass m. \u03930 = 6\u03c0\u03b7a/Cc m is the viscous damping due to\nthe medium viscosity \u03b7 and depending on particle radius\na and mass m. One must be careful to consider the noncontinuum effects of Stokes' Law in air due to the finite\nKnudsen number of the particles under study. To correct\nStokes' Law the empirical slip correction factor, Cc , is\nintroduced, with a 5.5-1.6% reduction in drag for 3-10\u03bcm\ndiameter droplets respectively [13].\nThe stochastic force \u03be, due to thermal agitation of solvent molecules, is generally assumed to be uncorrelated\non the time-scale of particle's motion:\n\nh\u03be(0)\u03be(t)i = 2\u03930 KB T /m \u03b4(t)\n\n(2)\n\nThe corresponding power spectrum S\u03be (\u03c9) of the\nstochastic variable \u03be can be defined as:\n\n\f2\n\n\u02c6 \u2032 )i = S\u03be (\u03c9)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 )\nh\u03be\u02c6\u2217 (\u03c9)\u03be(\u03c9\n\n(3)\n\nwhere:\n\u02c6\n\u03be(\u03c9)\n= 1/2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03be(t) exp[\u2212i\u03c9t]dt\n\n(4)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nBy putting (4) and (2) in (3) it is easily shown that \u03be\nhas a white noise spectrum\nS\u03be (\u03c9) =\n\n\u03930 K B T\n\u03c0m\n\n(5)\n\nBy Fourier transforming (1) and using (5) we can easily\nobtain the power spectrum of position fluctuations as:\n\nSx (\u03c9) =\n\nKB T 1\n\u03a920 \u03930\nk \u03c0 (\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03a920 )2 + \u039320 \u03c9 2\n\n(6)\n\nWhen trapping objects in liquid solvents the ratio\n\u03930 /\u03a90 is always larger than one, i.e the system is overdamped. The ratio \u03930 /\u03a90 depends only slightly on particle's size and, in solvents with water-like viscosities, is\nalways greater than 1 up to power levels of some tens\nof Ws. For typical trapping powers of order 10 mW in\nwater \u03930 /\u03a90 is typically > 10. As a result only those frequencies smaller than \u03930 , and hence much smaller than\n\u03a90 , have a significant amplitude in the power spectrum\nof x. Under these conditions we can therefore neglect \u03c9 2\nwith respect to \u03a920 in the first term of the denominator\nin (6) and obtain the usual Lorentzian power spectrum\ncharacterised by \u03c9 \u22122 tails [14]. Such an overdamped\ncondition precludes the possibility of exciting significant\noscillations either directly or parametrically. To probe\noscillations in the liquid damped regime we would need\nto be able to increase typical trap power by four orders\nof magnitude - introducing uncontrollable heating and\ndamage of the trapped object. A more feasible route is\nto reduce viscosity by two orders of magnitude. This last\ncondition can be readily obtained by trapping particles\nin air whose viscosity is approximately 1/55th of water\n(\u03b7 = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22125 Pa s) [13].\nFor these experiments, our optical tweezers are based\naround an inverted microscope with a high numerical\naperture oil immersion microscope objective (1.3NA,\n100\u00d7). The continuous wave laser is a Nd:YAG, frequency doubled to give 0-2 W of 532 nm light. To couple\nthe beam into the air medium, a single cover slip is rested\nover the objective on a thin oil layer. A water aerosol is\nproduced using a nebulizer and usually a 3-10\u03bcm diameter water droplet is trapped at the beam focus [15, 16],\nsee Fig. 1. One should note that whereas for particles\ntrapped in fluid, a laser power of 10s of mW is typical,\nhere, to maximise the stiffness of the trap, we use powers\nof order 1 W.\n\nFIG. 1: The measured power spectra of trapped aerosol particle at two different powers. At lower power (black circles) it\nis overdamped and the mean squared amplitude of the high\nfrequency motion decays as \u03c9 \u22122 . At higher powers (white\ncircles), the aerosol is underdamped and the mean squared\namplitude decays as \u03c9 \u22124 . The inset shows an optical image\nof a trapped aerosol particle.\n\nA quadrant photo detector, placed in the back focal\nplane of the condenser lens, receives the light transmitted\nthrough the droplet. By measuring the imbalance of the\nlight collected by the quadrants, the lateral displacement\nof the droplet is deduced with a bandwidth of several kHz\nand a precision of better than 5 nm [17].\nThe power spectra of the measured displacement, for\ntwo different trap powers, are shown in Fig. 1. It is\nclearly visible how the particle dynamics crosses over\nfrom an over damped dynamics with a Lorentzian spectrum with a high frequency roll-off proportional to \u03c9 \u22122\nto an underdamped regime with a faster roll-off, \u03c9 \u22124 ,\nand the appearance of a resonance peak at a frequency\nof about 1 kHz. The emergence of such a peak arises from\nthe fact that the inertial terms in (1) are no longer negligible. As a consequence an average trajectory starting\naway from the equilibrium position crosses the equilibrium position with a finite velocity.\nIn this situation the parametric resonance is excited\nby modulating the strength of the trapping potential.\nIdeally the potential is made shallower when the particle\ntraverses the equilibrium position and steeper again when\nthe particle is far from the equilibrium position. This is\nmaximally efficient when we modulate the potential at\ntwice the natural oscillation frequency \u03a90 . To consider\nthis model in quantitative terms we can rewrite (1) in\nthe presence of a parametrically modulated external potential:\n\n\f3\n\n\u1e8d(t) + \u03a920 [1 + gf (t)]x(t) + \u03930 \u1e8b(t) = \u03be(t)\n\n(7)\n\nf (t + T ) = f (t), \u22121 < f (t) < 1\n\n(8)\n\nwhere 0 < g < 1 measures the strength of modulation.\nBy Fourier transforming (7) we obtain:\n\n(\u2212\u03c9 2 + \u03a920 + i\u03c9\u03930 )x\u0302(\u03c9) + \u03a920 g\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u02c6\nak x\u0302(\u03c9 + k\u03a91 ) = \u03be(\u03c9)\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\n(9)\nwhere ak is the coefficient of the k2\u03c0/T = k\u03a91 frequency component of the Fourier series expansion of f (t).\nIt is clear from equation (9) how parametric modulation\nintroduces a coupling between all those frequencies differing by an integer number of \u03a91 . We now introduce the\n\u02c6 + n\u03a91 )\nvectors Xn (\u03c9) = x\u0302(\u03c9 + n\u03a91 ) and Rn (\u03c9) = \u03be(\u03c9\nand write the recursive relations:\n[\u2212(\u03c9 + n\u03a91 )2 + \u03a920 + i(\u03c9 + n\u03a91 )\u03930 ]Xn (\u03c9) +\n\u221e\nX\nak Xn+k (\u03c9) = Rn .\n\u03a920 g\n\n(10)\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nTo obtain the power spectrum Sx (\u03c9), for each frequency \u03c9 we should compute X0 (\u03c9). This will be, in\nturn, coupled to all other components in the array Xn .\nHowever the strength of the coupling will decay for large\n|n| so that we can limit ourselves to a finite number of\ncomponents and write the matrix equation for the array\nX(\u03c9) = [X\u2212N (\u03c9), ..., XN (\u03c9)]:\nG\u22121 (\u03c9)X(\u03c9) = R(\u03c9)\n\n(11)\n\nwith\n2\n2\n2\nG\u22121\nnk (\u03c9) = [\u2212(\u03c9+n\u03a91 ) +\u03a90 +i(\u03c9+n\u03a91 )\u03930 ]\u03b4nk +\u03a90 gak\u2212n\n(12)\nBy matrix inversion we obtain the power spectrum as:\n\nhX0\u2217 (\u03c9)X0 (\u03c9 \u2032 )i =\n\nN\nX\n\nG\u22170k (\u03c9)G0l (\u03c9 \u2032 )hRk\u2217 (\u03c9)Rn (\u03c9 \u2032 )i\n\nk,n=\u2212N\nN\n\u03930 K B T X\n|G0n (\u03c9)|2 \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2032 )(13)\n=\n\u03c0m\nn=\u2212N\n\nand from the definition of power spectrum:\n\nSx (\u03c9) =\n\nN\n\u03930 K B T X\n|G0k (\u03c9)|2\n\u03c0m\n\n(14)\n\nk=\u2212N\n\nIf \u03a90 and \u03930 are known, we can use (14) to predict the\npower spectrum of a Brownian particle in a modulated\n\ntrap. The white circles of Fig.2 show the measured power\nspectrum for a trapped water droplet when the trap has\nconstant power. The presence of the peak suggests that\nwe are in an underdamped regime. By fitting to equation\n(6) (solid line) we can directly extract the resonant frequency \u03a90 /2\u03c0 = 2.0 kHz and the damping term \u03930 = 6.8\nkHz relevant to our experimental conditions. The fitted\nvalue of \u03930 corresponds to the Stokes drag on an aerosol\ndroplet of radius 3.4\u03bcm.\nWe then apply the square-wave modulation of the trapping power, with the laser adjusted to give the same average power as before, \u03a91 \u2243 2\u03a90 and g = 0.4. The black\ncircles of Fig.2 show the power spectrum of the lateral\nmotion for the trapped water droplet with modulated\nlaser power. The excitation of a resonance appears as a\nhigher and narrower peak in the power spectrum. This\nobserved spectrum matches closely the expected behavior\n(solid line) obtained by applying the measured parameters \u03a90 , \u03930 , \u03a91 , g to equation (14), strongly supporting\nour interpretation of this peak being due to a parametric\nexcitation of the resonance. Higher harmonics, characterizing the response of parametrically driven systems, are\nsuppressed in our case, being only slightly underdamped.\nUsing these parameters with (14) we can make general predictions about the dynamics of a particle that\ncan then be verified against experiments. One comparison to make is the predicted and observed form of the\npower spectra as a function of the modulation frequency,\nboth above and below the parametric resonance condition. These results are shown in Fig. 3, the white circles\nare the experimental points and the black lines are the\npredicted spectra. Again, there is an excellent agreement\nbetween the observed and predicted particle motion. In\nparticular the parametric excitation of oscillations manifests as a narrowing of the peak (or a reduced apparent\ndamping \u0393, defined as the full width half maximum), occurring when modulating at twice \u03a90 . A shift in peak position \u03a9p is also apparent close to parametric resonance.\nBoth of these signatures are compared with theoretical\nexpectations in Fig. 4 further supporting our interpretation of the system as being a Brownian parametric oscillator .\nWe recognise that the system we report here relates to\nstudy of only the lateral motion of the trapped droplets.\nIn keeping with other work we note from examination\nof the video images that the axial movement of the\ntrapped droplet has significant amplitude on much longer\ntimescales, corresponding to frequencies in the region of\n10-50Hz [19]. This reflects the comparatively weak axial trapping, possibly arising from aberrations associated\nwith non optimised objectives or the increased scattering\nforce. It may be possible to use doughnut or LaguerreGaussian beams having zero on-axis intensity, and improved axial trapping [18].\nWe have reported the first observation of a parametrically excited resonance within a Brownian oscillator.\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: The measure power spectrum of a trapped water\ndroplet for no modulation of the laser power (white circles)\nand modulation at 3.9 kHz (\u03a91 \u2243 2\u03a90 ) (black circles).
