The pulsar is located inside the supernova\nremnant SNR 0540\u2013693 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It has a short rotation period\n(\u223c50 ms) and a rapid spindown with a characteristic age of only 1500 yr. There are strong\nsimilarities between this system and the Crab. The pulsars have similar characteristics\nand the plerion around PSR B0540\u221269 is very similar to the Crab Nebula in size and\n1\n\nSchool of Physics, University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia. email simonj@physics.usyd.edu.au\n\n2\n\nDept. of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-4060, USA. email rwr@astro.stanford.edu\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nenergetics (Manchester, Staveley-Smith & Kesteven 1993). Following the discovery of the\nX-ray pulsations from PSR B0540\u221269, optical pulsations were soon detected (Middleditch\n& Pennypacker 1985), but the radio pulsations remained elusive. Finally, Manchester et al.\n(1993; hereafter M93) discovered a broad, weak radio pulse at 0.64 GHz. The flux density\nat that frequency is 0.4 mJy and the pulse duty cycle is more than 80% with the hint of a\ndouble profile. This is similar to the high energy profiles (de Plaa, Kuiper & Hermsen 2003)\nwhich also appear to show a broad, unresolved double structure. M93 failed to detect the\npulsar at either 1.4 or 0.44 GHz.\nIn comparison, the radio profile of the Crab pulsar is complex. It consists of a so-called\npre-cursor component and main and interpulse components. The pre-cursor has a very\nsteep spectral index rendering it undetectable above about 1 GHz. The main and interpulse\nemission are in phase with the X-ray and \u03b3-ray emission which both have narrow peaks.\nAt frequencies above 5 GHz, further components have been detected (Moffett & Hankins\n1999). The Crab pulsar also produces giant pulses when the emission can exceed the mean\npulse energy by a factor of 1000 or more. This giant pulse emission occurs at the phases\nof the main pulse and interpulse but not at those of the pre-cursor or the 'anomalous' high\nfrequency components (Lundgren et al. 1995; Hankins et al. 2003).\nGiant pulses have now also been discovered from the millisecond pulsars PSRs B1937+21\n(Cognard et al. 1996) and B1821\u201324 (Romani & Johnston 2001). Cognard et al. (1996)\nnoticed that when pulsars are ordered by their magnetic field strength at the light cylinder,\nthe pulsars with giant pulses are highly ranked. Romani & Johnston (2001) noted the\nsimilarity between the phases of the giant pulse emission and the X-ray emission in these\npulsars and speculated that the giant pulse emission may also originate from near the light\ncylinder. McLaughlin & Cordes (2003) have very recently reported the non-detection of\ngiant pulses from PSR B0540\u221269 through observations made at 0.66 and 1.52 GHz.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nObservations were made on 20 May 2001 (MJD 52049), with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. We used the center beam of the 21-cm multi-beam system at an observing frequency\nof 1.38 GHz. The receiver had a system equivalent flux density of 27 Jy on cold sky. The\nback-end consisted of a filterbank system containing 512 channels per polarization, each of\nwidth 0.5 MHz for a total bandwidth of 256 MHz. The polarization pairs were summed to\nform the total power, each output was then sampled at 80 \u03bcs, one-bit digitized, and written\nto DLT for off-line analysis. A total of 8 hr of integration on PSR B0540\u221269 was obtained,\nsplit into 4 individual observations, each of duration 2 hr.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nTo search for giant pulses, it is not necessary to know the rotational frequency of the\npulsar but it is necessary to know the dispersion measure (DM). As an initial trial, we used\nthe DM of 146 cm\u22123 pc given in M93. After applying the appropriate delay to each frequency\nchannel, the 512 channels were summed. The mean and rms of groups of 8192 samples (0.65 s)\nwere examined and those which showed obvious signs of interference were discarded. Our\nnominal 5\u03c3 sensitivity in 80 \u03bcs is 0.9 Jy. In practice, even after the removal of high sigma\npoints (clipping), we experienced substantially larger background fluctuations and the rms\nexceeded our expected rms by a factor of \u223c2. The entire 8 hr observation (3.6\u00d7108 samples)\nwas then searched for peaks. This technique was successfully used to discover giant pulses\nin PSR B1821\u201324 (Romani & Johnston 2001) and the giant micro-pulses in PSR B1706\u201344\n(Johnston & Romani 2002). Two large amplitude, resolved pulses were discovered. We were\nable to determine the DM of these single pulses by subdividing the total bandwidth into 16\nand fitting a straight line to their time-of-arrival across the 16 sub-bands. The DM of both\npulses was determined to be 146.5\u00b10.2 cm\u22123 pc. Armed with this knowledge we then applied\na DM of 146.5 cm\u22123 pc to the entire data set.\nWe then used a more sophisticated search technique to detect weaker giant pulses. The\nDM introduces a broadening of 220 \u03bcs across each 0.5 MHz channel and the full width at half\nmaximum of the strong giant pulses was \u223c600 \u03bcs, or 8 samples. We therefore first smoothed\nthe data using a top hat function with a width of 8 samples and then searched the data\nlooking for 4 consecutive data points more than 3\u03c3 from the mean.\n\n3.\n\nPulse Timing and Phase Comparisons\n\nIn order to obtain the correct pulsar phase for each time sample, an accurate timing\nsolution for the pulsar is required. The latest published ephemeris for PSR B0540\u221269 from\nX-ray timing with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) does not cover the epoch of our\nobservations (Zhang et al. 2001) and we therefore used an updated ephemeris provided to us\nby F. Marshall and W. Zhang from RXTE observations near MJD 52050, including overlap\nwith our observing epochs. The peak of the X-ray profile at the solar system barycenter occurred 0.0366 s after MJD 52050 and at this epoch the spin frequency was 19.7886114394 s\u22121\nand the frequency derivative was \u22121.875580\u00d710\u221210 s\u22122 . The position of the pulsar used in\nthe ephemeris was that obtained from optical observations by Caraveo et al. (1992). Sample\nRXTE arrival times on the same dates as the radio observations agree with the adopted\nephemeris, with uncertainties . 0.5ms. Using this timing solution we were therefore able to\nform an integrated profile of the entire 8 hr observation, and we assert that uncertainties in\nthe X-ray ephemeris would be insufficient to broaden the pulse by more than \u223c0.5 ms (\u223c1%\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nof the pulse period).\nDirect comparison of the phases of the radio giant pulses with the X-ray profile is,\nhowever, subject to some uncertainty. We believe the absolute timing in the radio to be\ncorrect, as we have obtained arrival times for both the Crab pulsar and PSR B1937+21\nwhich agree with independent radio ephemerides. However, the absolute X-ray timing is not\nsecure and it is known that there are problems comparing RXTE timing of PSR B0540\u221269\nand those made with the Chandra X-ray Observatory (A. Rots, private communication).\n\n4.\n\nIntegrated Profile\n\nWe failed to detect any significant integrated pulsed emission from the pulsar. The\nbottom panel of Fig. 1 shows the pulse profile with 128 phase bins after 8 hr of observations.\nThe 1-\u03c3 rms is 80 \u03bcJy. As a check against the possibility that the X-ray ephemeris was\nincorrect we also performed a Fast Fourier Transform on each de-dispersed 2 hr dataset\nindependently. No significant signals were detected near the expected pulsar frequency.\nAssuming the pulsar has a duty cycle of \u223c10%, the upper limit on the continuum flux\ndensity at 1.38 GHz is therefore only 13 \u03bcJy compared to 400 \u03bcJy at 0.64 GHz (M93).\nThis implies a spectral index steeper than \u20134.4 between the two frequencies, although this\ncould be relaxed if the duty cycle of the profile is large and/or the 0.64 GHz flux density is\nincorrect. This is extremely high, even by pulsar standards, but it is comparable with the\nspectral index of the pre-cursor component in the Crab pulsar. The distance to the Large\nMagellanic Cloud is 49.4 kpc, hence the luminosity of the pulsar at 1.38 GHz is less than\n32 mJy kpc2 . Although this is low compared to the luminosity of other young pulsars, and a\nfactor of 100 less than the luminosity of the Crab pulsar, it is significantly higher than that\nof the recently discovered PSR J0205+6449 in the SNR 3C58 (Camilo et al. 2002).\n\n5.\n\nGiant Pulses\n\nAs described above, the initial search of the data detected two giant pulses. These are\nshown in the top panel of Fig. 1 where both the entire profile is shown and a more detailed\nview of the structure in the giant pulses. The widths of these pulses are entirely consistent\nwith an intrinisic delta function convolved with the sampling rate (80 \u03bcs), the dispersion\ndelay (220 \u03bcs) and an exponential tail with a 1/e time of 0.4 ms. This exponential broadening\nis likely the result of interstellar scattering. The two pulses are offset in phase by 0.03.\nUsing the analysis described in Section 2 (data smoothing plus searching for several\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nlarge consecutive samples), we searched a range of DMs in order to determine the cut-off\nabove which no spurious signals were detected. The best results were obtained using the\ncriteria that four consecutive samples should exceed 3\u03c3. We applied this analysis on the\ndata at a DM of 146.5 cm\u22123 pc and detected 15 giant pulses down to this sensitivity limit.\nFig. 2 shows the flux density as a function of phase for the 15 detected giants superposed\non the X-ray profile taken from De Plaa et al. (2003). There are two separate phase regions\nfor the giant pulses, the first between phases 0.36 and 0.45 and the second between 0.61\nand 0.66 phase. These phases should be considered preliminary in light of the discussion\nabout absolute timing above. This is similar to the Crab giant pulses which also occur in\ntwo separate phase regions. However, the jitter in the phases of the giants in PSR B0540\u221269\nis much larger than in the Crab; \u223c5 ms compared to \u223c0.5 ms. Fig. 3 shows the histogram\nof the flux densities obtained. Although we are dealing only with small number statistics,\nit seems clear that the slope is not as steep as the slope of \u20133.5 seen in the Crab pulsar\n(Lundgren et al. 1995) or that of \u20132.8 seen in PSR B1937+21 (Kinkhabwala & Thorsett\n2000).\nTwo other points are worth noting. The first is that the brightest giant obtained has\na flux density which exceeds the mean single pulse flux density by a factor &5000. This is\na larger factor than any giant pulse seen in the Crab pulsar. All the giants detected here\nexceed the mean flux density by 700. Expressed in these terms, this rate of giants (1 in\n35000) exceeds that of the Crab pulsar (1 in 350000; see Lundgren et al. 1995) by an order\nof magnitude. However, in terms of the emitted energy, the giants in PSR B0540\u221269 are\nsignificantly less powerful than in the Crab pulsar.\nFinally, the non-detection of giant pulses in PSR B0540\u221269 at 1.5 GHz by McLaughlin\n& Cordes (2003) can probably be attributed to their observational setup. Their sampling\nrate was 0.6 ms, however, the dispersion smearing across each of their 5 MHz filters was\n\u223c2 ms and this is sufficient to dilute the giant pulse enough for it to fall below their quoted\ndetection threshold of 0.4 Jy. Their non-detection of giant pulses at 0.66 GHz would imply\nthat either the spectral index of the giant pulses are shallower than \u20133, in contrast to the\nintegrated profile, or that there is no giant pulse emission at this frequency. The latter\nseems unlikely given that both the Crab and PSR B1937+21 show giant pulse emission\nat frequencies well below 0.66 GHz. McLaughlin & Cordes (2003) do not comment on a\ndetection or non-detection of the integrated pulse at this frequency.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPSR B0540\u221269 is the 4th pulsar known to emit giant pulses and there are now two\nyoung pulsars and two millisecond pulsars which emit giants. We detected the giant pulses\nwithout detecting the underlying integrated pulsed emission. The four pulsars are in the\ntop five pulsars when ranked by magnetic field at the light cylinder; only PSR B1957+20\nfrom this list does not show giant emission. Clearly therefore this parameter is important\nto our understanding of the giant pulse phenomenon. Furthermore, all four objects have\npulsed, non-thermal, X-ray emission. In the Crab, PSRs B1937+21 and B1821\u201324 the Xray emission appears to be in phase with the giant radio emission. It is intriguing that for\nPSR B0540\u221269, the two giant pulse windows are \u223c 0.5 out of phase with the X-ray pulse\nand that their spacing is similar to that of the high energy pulse components. Whether\nthis indicates an error in the relative phasing between the radio and X-ray obserations or\nan association of the giant pulses with the magnetic pole opposite the high energy emission\nremains to be tested with independent phase comparisons.\nGiven the exponential broadening of the giant pulses at 1.38 GHz, it seems likely that\nthe integrated profile at 0.64 GHz is dominated by scattering (M93). Scatter broadening\nscales with the inverse fourth power of the frequency and hence should be \u223c20 times larger\nat 0.64 GHz than at 1.38 GHz. The 0.64 GHz profile is thus consistent with a double peaked\nprofile separated by \u223c0.3 phase and broadened by \u223c10 ms of scattering. It is tempting\nto relate the location of this double peaked structure with the location of the giant pulses\ndetected at the higher frequency. Further observations at 0.64 GHz are needed to confirm\nthis. Furthermore, the scattering at high frequency would also explain the non-detection\nof the pulsar at 0.44 GHz reported by M93, where the scattering time would exceed the\npulse period. These values also indicate that the effects of scintillation are not important in\nthe giant pulse search toward PSR B0540\u221269, contrary to the suggestion of McLaughlin &\nCordes (2003).\nThe DM is high compared to the other known pulsars in the Large Magellanic Cloud\nwhich have DMs in the range 67 \u2013 107 cm\u22123 pc (McConnell et al. 1991). A scattering time of\n\u223c0.4 ms at 1.38 GHz is also large, especially when the scattering screen is likely to be located\nmuch closer to the pulsar (i.e. in the LMC) than to the Earth. The situation is analogous\nto that seen in the Vela pulsar, where both the DM and the scattering are much larger than\nexpected for its distance. Both the excess DM and the scattering likely arise inside the Vela\nSNR itself where the line of sight intersects a dense clump of ionised material.\nExpressed as a continuum flux density, the largest giant pulses have 1.4 GHz flux densities at a distance of 1 kpc of 4000, 200, 7 and 10 Jy for the Crab, PSRs PSR B0540\u221269,\n1821\u201324 and 1937+21 respectively for roughly the same number of rotations of the pulsar\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n(\u223c106 ). The giant pulses from the two millisecond pulsars have very similar flux densities\nand these are significantly less than those of the young pulsars. From the point of view of\nsearching for giant pulses, the peak flux is the important value. The giant pulses in the Crab\npulsar and in PSR B1937+21 are known to have widths of order microseconds. Assuming all\nthe giant pulses have durations of \u223c1 \u03bcs, then the giant pulses have peak fluxes at 1.4 GHz at\na distance of 1 kpc of 130, 11, 0.03 and 0.02 MJy for the Crab, PSRs PSR B0540\u221269, 1821\u2013\n24 and 1937+21 which makes the differences between the young pulsars and the millisecond\npulsars even more striking. In principle, therefore, the Parkes telescope is capable of detecting giant pulses from young pulsars at distances of \u223c1 Mpc, and millisecond pulsars out to\n\u223c50 kpc. In practise, however, lack of knowledge of the DM and scatter broadening both\nserve to weaken these limits. The prospects for future generation radio telescopes are excellent however. Even if, in young pulsars, the giant pulses only occur over the first \u223c2000 yr,\none might expect to see \u223c20 per large galaxy and more in the nearby starburst galaxies. For\nmillisecond pulsars, the faster objects which have high magnetic fields at the light cylinder,\nwill produce giant pulses for a Hubble time. There therefore may be a large population\nof millisecond pulsars which produce giant pulses, enhancing the prospects for targetted\nsearches of globular cluster in external galaxies. Detection of extra-galactic pulsars will yield\nthe electron density content of the inter-galactic medium, important in understanding the\nnature of the dark matter (Maloney & Bland-Hawthorn 2001).\n\n7.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have detected giant pulses from the young pulsar PSR B0540\u221269 in the LMC and\nyet have failed to detect the integrated flux from the pulsar after 8 hr observing. Four\npulsars, including PSR B0540\u221269, are now known to have giant pulses and these four are in\nthe top five when ranked by their magnetic field at the light cylinder. In the near future we\nplan to observe PSR B0540\u221269 at both lower and higher radio frequencies to determine the\nspectral index of the giant pulse emission and also to replicate the detection of the pulsar at\n0.64 GHz by M93. We also plan a simultaneous radio and X-ray observation to both obtain\naccurate phasing between the radio and X-ray and to look for giant pulses in the X-ray.\nThe Australia Telescope is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as\na National Facility managed by the CSIRO.
