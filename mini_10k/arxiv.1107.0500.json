We review known factorization results in quaternion\nmatrices. Specifically, we derive the Jordan canonical form, polar\ndecomposition, singular value decomposition, the QR factorization.\nWe prove there is a Schur factorization for commuting matrices,\nand from this derive the spectral theorem. We do not consider\nalgorithms, but do point to some of the numerical literature.\nRather than work directly with matrices of quaternions, we work\nwith complex matrices with a specific symmetry based on the dual\noperation. We discuss related results regarding complex matrices\nthat are self-dual or symmetric, but perhaps not Hermitian.\n\n1. The quaternionic condition\nIt is possible to prove many factorization results for matrices of quaterions by deriving them from their familiar complex counterparts. The\namount of additional work is surprisingly small.\nThere are more abstract factorization theorems that apply to real\n\u2217\nC -algebras, along the lines of the delightful paper by Pedersen on\nfactorization in (complex) C \u2217 -algebras. We are dealing here with more\nbasic questions, involving only finite-dimensional linear algebra. These\nare never (hardly ever?) addressed in basis linear algebra texts, creating\nthe impression that linear algebra over the quaternions is more difficult\nthan it really is.\nThere are serious hazards within linear algebra over the quaternions.\nOne can be lured to difficult questions of determinants and handedness\nof the spectrum, leaving perhaps victorious, but with the impression\nthat all of linear algebra over the quaternions is going to be difficult.\nWe mathematicians are well-advised, when upon such uneven ground,\nto seek guidance from physicists. Such guidance helped select the topics, and helped suggest notation.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 15B33.\nKey words and phrases. Kramers pair, matrix decompositions, dual operation,\nquaternions.\n1\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n2\n\nOne topic was included for reasons of elegance, the Jordan canonical\nform. For practical purposes, the Schur decomposition will generally\nsuffice. We prove that as well.\nIt is assumed the reader is familiar with such things as the spectral\ntheorem and the functional calculus for normal matrices. It is not\nassumed that the reader knows about C \u2217 -algebras or physics, but these\ntopics are mentioned incidentally.\nLet H denote the algebra of quaternions\nn\no\nH = a + b\u00ee + c\u0135 + dk\u0302 a, b, c, d \u2208 R .\n\nThis is an algebra over R. The canonical embedding C \u0592\u2192 H sending 1\nto 1 and i to \u00ee does not make H into an algebra over C. The trouble is\nthat the embedding is not central. An additional algebraic operation\nis the involution\n\u0010\n\u0011\u2217\na + b\u00ee + c\u0135 + dk\u0302 = a \u2212 b\u00ee \u2212 c\u0135 \u2212 dk\u0302\nwhich satisfies several axioms, including the following.\n\u03b1 \u2208 R, x \u2208 H =\u21d2 (\u03b1x)\u2217 = \u03b1x\u2217\nx\u2217 x = 0 =\u21d2 x = 0\n\n(xy)\u2217 = y \u2217x\u2217\nTurning to matrices, the algebra MN (H) has the expected structure\nof a unital R-algebra, plus the involution\n\u0002 \u0003\n[aij ]\u2217 = a\u2217ji\nof conjugate-transpose. We would like to know\nA\u2217 A = 0 =\u21d2 A = 0\nand\nAB = I =\u21d2 BA = I.\nWe will quickly prove these after we consider a representation of MN (H)\non C2N .\nWe have an obvious representation of MN (H) on HN and quickly\nnotice that since left and right scalar multiplication of HN disagree, we\nhave both left-eigenvalues \u03bb \u2208 H solving\nAv = \u03bbv\n\nand right-eigenvalues \u03bc \u2208 H solving\n\nAv = v\u03bc.\n\nA glance at the survey [13] reveals that many difficulties arise.\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n3\n\nPonder the situation for real matrices, in MN (R). To the chagrin\nof undergraduates, it is most natural to consider the representation\nof MN (R) on CN . Given a real orthogonal matrix O we get the full\npicture of why it might not diagonalize in MN (R) when we look at the\ncomplex eigenvalues. It is at this point that we are implicitly letting\nMN (R) act on CN .\nWe do well in the case of the quaternions to regard MN (H) as represented on C2N , or in more modern terms that de-emphasizes the role\nof vectors, via a certain embedding\n\u03c7 : MN (H) \u2192 M2N (C).\n\nThis is a very old trick. For N > 1 it appears to have been noticed\nfirst by H. C. Lee [7].\nDefinition 1.1. Given two complex N-by-N matrices A and B we set\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0014 A B \u0015\n\u03c7 A + B \u0135 =\n.\n\u2212B A\n\nWe generally study complex matrices in the image of \u03c7 and only at\nthe end of our calculations do we draw conclusions about MN (H). This\nis in keeping with applications in quantum mechanics, where Hilbert\nspace is always complex and time-reversal symmetry will often be incorporated in the conjugate linear operation T . We define T : C2N \u2192 C2N\nby\n\u0015\n\u0012\u0014\n\u0015\u0013 \u0014\nv\n\u2212w\n.\n(1.1)\nT\n=\nv\nw\n\nSee [9, \u00a72.2] for details on when T is relevant to time reversal symmetry.\nA less generous description our our approach is we plan to study\ncomplex matrices with a certain symmetry that is useful in physics,\nand then sell the same results to pure mathematicians by re-branding\nthem as theorems about matrices of quaternions.\nThe operator T is relatively well behaved, despite being only conjugate linear. It preserves orthogonality, and indeed\n(1.2)\nAlso\n(1.3)\n\nhT \u03be, T \u03b7i = h\u03be, \u03b7i.\n\u03be \u22a5T\u03be\n\nwhich is another one-line calculation.\n\nLemma 1.2. The mapping \u03c7 is well-defined, is an R-algebra homomorphism, is one-to-one and satisfies\n(\u03c7 (Y ))\u2217 = \u03c7 (Y \u2217 ) .\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n4\n\nProof. Notice that every quaternion q can be written as \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u0135 with \u03b1\nand \u03b2 in C. This makes the map well-defined. It is clearly one-to-one\nand R-linear. Notice \u03b2 \u0135 = \u0135 \u03b2\u0304 for complex number \u03b2 and so B \u0135 = \u0135B.\nTherefore\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011 \u0014 A B \u0015\u0014 C D \u0015\n\u03c7 A + B \u0135 \u03c7 C + D \u0135 =\n\u2212B A\n\u2212D C\n\u0015\n\u0014\nAD + BC\nAC \u2212 BD\n=\n\u2212BC \u2212 AD \u2212BD + AC\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u0011\n= \u03c7 AC \u2212 BD + AD + BC \u0135\n\u0010\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\u0011\n= \u03c7 A + B \u0135 C + D \u0135\nand\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\u0010\n\u0011\u2217 \u0011\n\u0010 \u0010\n\u0011\u0011\u2217 \u0014 A B \u0015\u2217\n= \u03c7 A\u2217 \u2212 B T \u0135 = \u03c7 A + B \u0135\n.\n\u03c7 A + B \u0135\n=\n\u2212B A\n\n\u0003\n\nWe can describe the image of \u03c7 in several useful ways. We will need\nseveral unary operations on complex matrices. For starters we need\nthe transpose AT and the pointwise conjugate A and the conjugateT\ntranspose, or adjoint, A\u2217 = A = AT . Finally, we need a twisted\ntranspose that is useful in physics. This is a \"generalized involution\"\nX \u266f called the dual operation that is defined only for X in M2N (C).\nDefinition 1.3.

Indeed, the choice of Z\nis not standardized.\nLemma 1.4. For X in M2N (C) the following are equivalent.\n(1) X is in the image of \u03c7;\n(2) X \u2217 = X \u266f ;\n(3) X = \u2212T \u25e6 X \u25e6 T meaning X\u03be = \u2212T (XT (\u03be)) for every vector\n\u03be in C2N .\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n5\n\nProof.

Therefore\n(2) \u21d0\u21d2 (3).\n\u0003\n\nDefinition 1.5. Let us call\n\nX\u2217 = X\u266f\nthe quaternionic condition and the matrix X we will call a quaternionic\nmatrix.\nWe now dispose of the implications\nA\u2217 A = 0 =\u21d2 A = 0\nand\nAB = I =\u21d2 BA = I\nfor matrices of quaternions. These are true implications for complex\nmatrices, and in particular for quaternionic matrices, and therefore true\nfor matrices of quaternions.\nWe pause to note some axioms of the dual operation. It behaves a\nlot like the transpose. It is linear,\n(X + \u03b1Y )\u266f = X + \u03b1Y \u266f\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n6\n\nwhich is true even for complex \u03b1. Here X and Y are any 2N-by-2N\ncomplex matrices. The dual reverses multiplication,\n(XY )\u266f = Y \u266f X \u266f .\nIt undoes itself,\n\u0001\u266f\nX\u266f = X\nand commutes with the adjoint\n\u0001\u2217\nX \u266f = (X \u2217 )\u266f .\n\nLemma 1.6. Every matrix G in M2N (C) can we expressed in a unique\nway as\nG = X + iY\nwith X and Y being quaternionic matrices.\nProof. Given G we set\n1\n1\nX = G\u266f\u2217 + G\n2\n2\nand\n\ni\ni\nY = G\u266f\u2217 \u2212 G.\n2\n2\n\n\u0003\n\n2. Kramers degeneracy and Schur factorization\nEigenvalue doubling is a key feature of self-dual, self-adjoint matrices. In physics this is called the Kramers degeneracy theorem, or the\ntheory of Kramers pairs [6, 12, 9]. This generalizes in two ways, to give\neigenvalue doubling given the symmetry X = X \u266f and conjugate-pairing\nof eigenvalues given the symmetry X \u2217 = X \u266f .\nSuch a collection of paired eigenvectors will, in good situations, form\na unitary matrix. If U is unitary matrix that satisfies the quaternionic condition then it satisfies another symmetry making it symplectic, specifically U T ZU = Z.\nLemma 2.1. Suppose U is a unitary 2N-by-2N matrix. The following\nare equivalent:\n(1) U is symplectic;\n(2) U \u2217 = U \u266f ;\n(3) ZU = UZ;\n(4) U \u25e6 T = T \u25e6 U;\n(5) If v is column j of U for j \u2264 N then column N + j of U is\nT (v).\nProof. This follows easily from Lemma 1.4.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n7\n\nWe need to know that the group of symplectic unitary acts transitively on Cn .\nLemma 2.2. If v is any unit vector in C2N then there is a symplectic\nunitary with Ue1 = v.\nProof. Let v1 = v. We use (1.2) and (1.3) to select in order vectors\nthat are an orthonormal basis for C2N , but of the form\nIf we reorder to\n\nv1 , T v1 , v2 , T v2 , . . . , vN , T vN .\nv1 , v2 , . . . , vN , T v1 , T v2 , . . . , T vN\n\nwe have the columns of the desired symplectic unitary.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe most basic result in this realm is an ugly lemma that says that\nT maps left eigenvectors of X to right eigenvectors of X \u266f , with the\nsame eigenvalue. The second part of this lemma is more elegant, if less\ngeneral. It specifices how every quaternionic matrix has a conjugate\nsymmetry it its spectral decomposition.\nLemma 2.3. Suppose X is in M2N (C).\n(1) If X\u03be = \u03bb\u03be then\n(T \u03be)\u2217 X \u266f = \u03bb (T \u03be)\u2217 .\n(2) If X \u2217 = X \u266f and X\u03be = \u03bb\u03be then\nX (T \u03be) = \u03bb (T \u03be) .\nProof.

Part (2) of Theorem 2.4 appeared in [11].\nTheorem 2.4. Suppose X1 , . . . , Xk in M2N (C) commute pairwise and\nXj\u2217 = Xj\u266f for all j.\n(1) There is a single symplectic unitary U so that, for all j,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nTj Sj\n\u2217\nU Xj U =\n.\n\u2212Sj Tj\nwith Tj upper-triangular and Sj strictly upper-triangular.\n(2) If, in addition, the Xj are normal then there is a single symplectic unitary U so that, for all j,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nDj 0\n\u2217\nU Xj U =\n.\n0 Dj\nwith Dj diagonal.\n(3) Every symplectic unitary has determinant one.\nProof. (1) A finite set of commuting matrices will have a common eigenvector, so let v be a unit vector so that Xj v = \u03bbj v. We know then that\nso T v is an eigenvalue for Xj with eigenvector \u03bbj . There is a symplectic\nunitary U1 so that U1 e1 = v, and then U1 eN +1 = T v by Lemma 2.1.\nLet Yj = U1\u2217 Xj U1 . Then\nYj e1 = \u03bbj e1\nand\nYj eN +1 = \u03bbj eN +1 .\nThis means the column 1 and column N + 1 are all but zeroed-out,\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u03bbj \u2217 0 \u2217\n\uf8ef 0 Aj 0 Cj \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\nYj = \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 0 \u2217 \u03bbj \u2217 \uf8fb .\n0 Bj 0 Dj\n\nUp to a non-symplectic change of basis we are looking at block-upper\ntriangular matrices that commute, so the lower-right corners in that\nbasis commute. This means that the\n\u0014\n\u0015\nAj Cj\n(2.1)\nZj =\nBj Dj\nall commute, and each must satisfy Zj\u2217 = Zj\u266f . By induction, we have\nproven the first claim.\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\nFor (2) we modify the proof just a little.\nwe find the Yj are also normal and so\n\uf8ee\n\u03bbj 0 0\n\uf8ef 0 Aj 0\nYj = \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 0 0 \u03bbj\n0 Bj 0\n\n9\n\nStarting with the Xj normal,\n\uf8f9\n0\nCj \uf8fa\n\uf8fa.\n0 \uf8fb\nDj\n\nThis, after an appropiate basis change, would be block-diagonal, and\nfrom this we can conclude that the matrix in (2.1) is normal. The\ninduction proceeds as before, with the stronger conclusion that Bj =\nCj = 0 and Aj = Dj is diagonal.\n(3) Applying (2) we find\n\u0015\n\u0014\nD 0\nU\u2217\nW =U\n0 D\n\nwhere D is a diagonal unitary. Therefore\n\ndet(W ) = det(D) det(D) = det(D)det(D) \u2265 0\n\nand since a unitary has determinant on the unit circle, we are done. \u0003\nCorollary 2.5. Every matrix in MN (H) is unitarily equivalent to a\nupper-triangular matrix in MN (H) that has complex numbers on the\ndiagonal.\nThere is an algorithm [1] for the Schur decomposition of quaternionic\nmatrices.\nCorollary 2.6. Every normal matrix in MN (H) is unitarily equivalent\nto a diagonal matrix in MN (C). Every Hermitian matrix in MN (H)\nis unitarily equivalent to a diagonal matrix in MN (R).\nCorollary 2.7.

For details on\nleft eigenvalues and non-complex right eigenvalues, consult [4]. We put\nthe complex right eigenvalues in a simple context with the following.\nLemma 2.8.

This a short, direct calculation.\n\n\u0003\n\n3. Jordan canonical form\nKramers degeneracy extends to the generalized eigenvectors used to\nfind the Jordan canonical form.\nLemma 3.1.

When we build a Jordan basis we need\nto respect T in two ways. Whatever basis we pick for the subspace\ncorresponding to \u03bb with positive imaginary part, we apply T to get the\nbasis for the subspace corresponding to \u03bb. When \u03bb is real we need to\npick generalized eigenvectors in pairs.\nThe Jordan form of a quaternionic matrix is not so elegant, as each\nJordan blocks larger than 2-by-2 gets spread around to all four quadrants of the matrix. We work directly with a Jordan basis and then\nmake our final conclusion in terms of quaternions.\nTheorem 3.2. Suppose X \u266f = X \u2217 . There is a Jordan basis for X\nconsisting of pairs of the form v, T v.\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n11\n\nProof. Let N\u03bb denote the subspace of all generalized eigenvectors for \u03bb\ntoghether with the zero vector. Recall that just treating X as a complex\nmatrix, the procedure to select a Jordan basis involves selecting, for\neach \u03bb, a basis for N\u03bb with the following property: whenever b is in\nthis basis, then (X \u2212 \u03bbI)b is either zero or back in this basis.\nFor \u03bb in the spectrum with positive imaginary part we make such\na choice and then apply T to get a set of vectors in N\u03bb that has the\ncorrect number of elements to be a basis of N\u03bb . It will also be a\nlinearly independent set since Z and conjugation both preserve linear\nindependence. Since\n(X \u2212 \u03bbI)T b = T (X \u2212 \u03bbI)b\n\nthis basis of N\u03bb has the desired property.\nFor \u03bb in the spectrum that is real we need to modify the procedure\nfor selecting the basis of N\u03bb . A common procedure selects a basis\nbr,1 , . . . , br,mr for\n\u0001\u22a5\n(3.1)\nker (X \u2212 \u03bb)r \u2229 ker (X \u2212 \u03bb)r\u22121 \u2229 (im (X \u2212 \u03bb))\u22a5\nand constructs for N\u03bb the Jordan basis\nn\no\n(X \u2212 \u03bb)j br,k 1 \u2264 r \u2264 rmax , 0 \u2264 j \u2264 r \u2212 1, k = 1, . . . , mr\n\nSince\n\nT (X \u2212 \u03bb)j br,k = (X \u2212 \u03bb)j T br,k\nwe get the desired structure if the subspaces (3.1) are T -invariant. This\nfollows from the next two lemmas and the equality\n\u0001\n(im (X \u2212 \u03bb))\u22a5 = ker X \u2217 \u2212 \u03bb .\n\nWe can now assemble the bases of the various N\u03bb to get a Jordan basis\nbuilt from the Kramers pairs.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.3. If X \u266f = X \u2217 then ker(X) is T -invariant.\nProof. This is a restatement of the \u03bb = 0 case of Lemma 2.3(2).\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 3.4. If a subspace H0 is T -invariant then (H0 )\u22a5 is also T invariant.\nProof. If v is in (H0 )\u22a5 then for every w \u2208 H0 we have\n\nhT v, wi = \u2212 hT v, T T wi = \u2212hv, T wi = 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.5. Suppose X \u2208 Mn (H). There is an invertible matrix\nS \u2208 Mn (H) and a complex matrix J in Jordan Form such that X =\nS \u22121 JS.\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n12\n\n4. Norms\nThere are two operator norms to consider on X in MN (H), that\ninduced by quaternionic Hilbert space and that induced by complex\nHilbert space on \u03c7 (X). They end up identical.\nTheorem 4.1. Suppose X is in MN (H). Then using the norms\n! 21\nN\nX\nkvk =\nvj\u2217 vj\nj=1\n\non HN and\n\nkwk =\non C2N we have\nsup\nv6=0\n\n2N\nX\nj=1\n\nvj vj\n\n! 12\n\nk\u03c7 (X) wk\nkXvk\n= sup\n.\nkvk\nkwk\nw6=0\n\nProof.

Singular value decomposition\nAs in the complex case, a slick way to prove there is a singular value\ndecomposition is to work out the polar decomposition and then use the\nspectral theorem on the positive part.\nIn [13] it is stated that \"a little more work is needed for the singular case\" when discussing the polar decomposition. The extra work\ninvolves padding out a quaternionic partial isometry to be a quaternionic unitary (so symplectic unitary.)\nWe remind the reader that U is a partial isometry when (U \u2217 U)2 =\nU \u2217 U, or equivalently UU \u2217 U = U or U \u2217 UU \u2217 = U \u2217 or (UU \u2217 )2 = UU \u2217 .\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n13\n\nIf we restrict the domain and range of U we find it is an isometry from\n(ker(U))\u22a5 to (ker(U \u2217 ))\u22a5 .\nLemma 5.1. Suppose U \u2217 = U \u266f and U is a partial isometry in M2N (C).\nThere is a symplectic unitary W in MN (C) so that W \u03be = U\u03be for all\n\u03be \u22a5 ker(U).\nProof. If v is in ker(U) then by Lemma 2.3, T v is also in ker(U). Since\nv and T v are orthogonal, we can show that ker(U) has even dimension\n2m and that is has a basis for the form\nv1 , . . . , vm , T v1 , . . . , T vm .\n\nWe are working in finite dimensions so the dimension of ker(U \u2217 ) is also\n2m and we select for it a basis\nw1 , . . . , wm , T w1 , . . . , T wm .\n\nWe can define W to agree with U on (ker(U))\u22a5 and to send vj to wj\nand T vj to T wj and so get a unitary that commutes with T , which\nmeans it is symplectic.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.2. Suppose X \u2217 = X \u266f in M2N (C). Then there is a unitary U\nand a positive semidefinite P with U \u2217 = U \u266f and P \u2217 = P \u266f and X = UP .\nProof. Let f be a continuous function on the positive reals with f (0) =\n1\n0 and f (\u03bb) = \u03bb\u2212 2 for every nonzero eigenvalue of X \u2217 X. Then let\nW = Xf (X \u2217X).\nThe usual calculations in functional calculus tell us W is a partial isom1\netry and that X = W P for P = (X \u2217 X) 2 . Working with monomials,\npolynomials and then taking limits, we can show\n\u0001\n(f (Y ))\u266f = f Y \u266f\nfor any positive operator Y and so\n\u0001\nW \u266f = f X \u266f X \u2217\u266f X \u266f = f (X \u2217 X) X \u2217 = W \u2217 .\n\nAlso P \u266f = P = P \u2217 .\nWe just showed that the matrices in the minimal polar decomposition\nare quaternionic. We use Lemma 5.1 to finish the argument.\n\u0003\n\nAs expected, the polar decomposition leads to a singular value decomposition.\nTheorem 5.3. Suppose X \u2217 = X \u266f in M2N (C). There are symplectic\nunitary matrices U and V and a diagonal matrix D with nonnegative\nreal entries and D \u266f = D \u2217 so that X = UDV .\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n14\n\nProof. We take a quaternionic polar decomposition X = W P . Since P\nis positive, we apply Theorem 2.4 to get symplectic unitary matrices\nQ and V and diagonal matrix D so that P = QDV . The eigenvalues\nof P are nonnegative, so the same is true for the diagonal elements of\nD and we have the needed factorization X = (W Q)DV .\n\u0003\n6. QR factorization\nIt is easy to use Lemma 2.2 to get over H a QR factorization theorem.\nNotice that upper triangular matrices are sent by \u03c7 to matrices that\nare block upper-triangular.\nTheorem 6.1. If X \u2217 = X \u266f in M2N (C) the there is a symplectic unitary\nQ and R of the form\n\u0015\n\u0014\nA B\nR=\n\u2212B A\nwith A and B upper triangular. If X \u2208 MN (H) then there is a untiary\nQ and upper triangular matrix R in MN (H) so that X = QR.\nProof. (2) follows directly from (1), so we prove (1).\nWe apply Lemma 2.2 to the first column of X and find X = Q1 R1\nwhere\n\u0014\n\u0015\nA1 B1\nR1 =\n\u2212B1 A1\nwhere A1 and B1 have zeros in their first columns, except perhaps in\nthe top position. As we did earlier, we can proceed with a proof by\ninduction.\n\u0003\n7. Self-dual matrices\nIf we study matrices with X \u266f = X then we are no longer working\ndirectly with quaternionic matrices, but as we discuss below, there is\na connection. We discuss a Schur factorization and a structured polar\ndecomposition for self-dual matrices. The latter is a bit tricky, so we\nwarm up with a structured polar decomposition for symmetric complex\nmatrices.\nFor dealing with a single self-dual matrix, there is the efficient Paige\n/ Van Loan algorithm [5, 10] to implement the following theorem.\nTheorem 7.1. Given X1 , . . . , Xk in M2N (C) that commute pairwise\nand are self-dual, there is a single symplectic unitary U so that for all\nj,\n\u0015\n\u0014\nTj Cj\n\u2217\n.\nU Xj U =\n0 TjT\nwith Tj upper-triangular and the Cj skew-symmetric.\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n15\n\nProof. Let v be a nonzero unit vector so that Xj v = \u03bbj v for all j. By\nLemma 2.3,\nXj\u2217 (T v) = \u03bbj (T v) .\nThere is a symplectic unitary U1 so that U1 e1 = v and U1 eN +1 = T v.\nLet Yj = U1\u2217 Xj U1 . Then\nYj e1 = \u03bbj e1\nand\nYj\u2217 eN +1 = \u03bbj eN +1 .\nSince eN +1 is real, we take adjoint and discover\nT\neT\nN +1 Yj = \u03bbj eN +1 .\n\nThis means the column 1 and row N\n\uf8ee\n\u03bbj \u2217\n\uf8ef 0 Aj\nYj = \uf8ef\n\uf8f0 0 0\n0 Bj\n\n+ 1 are all but zeroed-out,\n\uf8f9\n\u2217 \u2217\n\u2217 Cj \uf8fa\n\uf8fa.\n\u03bbj 0 \uf8fb\n\u2217 Dj\n\nBasic facts about block triangular matrices show that the\n\u0014\n\u0015\nAj Cj\nZj =\nBj Dj\n\nare a commuting family of matrices, and since U1 was chosen to be\nsymplectic, the Zj will be self-dual. As simple induction now finishes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nA promising numerical technique for the joint diagonalization of two\ncommuting self-dual self-adjoint matrices H and K would be to form\nthe normal self-dual matrix X = A + iB and apply Paige / Van Loan\nto reduce to block diagonal form. Then apply ordinary Schur decomposition. This technique was used in [5, \u00a79] to diagonalize matrices\nthat were exactly self-dual and approximately unitary. This idea is\nmentioned in [2], section 6.5.\nIt is not hard to show that the minimal polar decomposition, the one\nthat is unique and can involve a partial isometry, preserves in some way\njust about any symmetry thrown at it. This is because the functional\ncalculus interacts well with the dual operation [8], as well as with the\ntranspose. It is a bit harder to figure what happens for the maximal\npolar decomposition. By the minimal polar decomposition is meant the\nfactorization that is unique and can involve a partial isometry. By the\nmaximal polar decomposition is meant the factorization that involves\na unitary.\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n16\n\nWe begin with the easier result about the polar decomposition of\ncomplex symmetric matrices.\nTheorem 7.2. If X in M2n (C) satisfies X T = X then there is a\nunitary U so that U T = U and X = U |X|.\n1\n\nProof. Again chose f with f (0) = 0 and f (\u03bb) = \u03bb\u2212 2 for every nonzero\neigenvalue of X \u2217 X and let\nW = Xf (X \u2217X).\n1\n\nAs always, W is a partial isometry and X = W P for P = (X \u2217 X) 2 =\n|X|. Now we discover\n\u0001\nW T = f X T X X T = f (XX \u2217 ) X = Xf (X \u2217 X) = W.\n\nTo create a unitary U with X = U |X| we must extend W to map\nker(W ) to ker (W \u2217 ). We can arrange U T = U as follows. Let v1 , . . . , vm\nbe an orthonormal basis of ker(W ). Then v1 , . . . , vm will be an orthonormal basis of ker(W \u2217 ) = ker(W ) and we define V to be zero on\n(ker(W ))\u22a5 and V vj = vj . Thus V \u2217 will be zero on (ker(W ))\u22a5 and\nV \u2217 vj = vj , but the same can be said about V . That means V T = V\nand so U = W + V will be the required symmetric unitary.\nNotice there is no structure on |X|, but considered with |X \u2217 | we get\nthe formula\n(7.1)\n\n|X \u2217 | = |X|T .\n\u0003\n\nFor the self-dual situation, we shall see that a similar construction\nworks so long as we respect Kramers degeneracy.\nProposition 7.3. If a partial isometry W in M2N (C) is self-dual,\nthen the initial space of W will have even dimension and T will map\nthe initial space isometrically onto the final space of W .\nProof. Applying Lemma 2.3 to the self-adjoint matrix W \u2217 W we find\nW \u2217 W v = v =\u21d2 (W \u2217 W )\u266f T v = T v\n=\u21d2 (W W \u2217 ) T v = T v\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n17\n\nThat is, when v \u2208 (ker W )\u22a5 we have T v \u2208 (ker W \u2217 )\u22a5 and kW \u2217 T vk =\nkvk. This is useful because\nhv, W \u2217T vi = hv, \u2212W \u2217 Zvi\n= \u2212W T Zv, v\n\n= h\u2212ZW v, vi\n= hv, W \u2217 Zvi\n\n= \u2212 hv, W \u2217 T vi\n\nwhich means v and W \u2217 T v are orthogonal, and\nW \u2217 T W \u2217 T v = W \u2217 ZW \u2217 Zv\n\n= W \u2217 ZW T Zv\n= \u2212W \u2217 W \u266f v\n= \u2212W \u2217 W v\n= \u2212v.\n\nIf we start with a unit vector v in (ker W )\u22a5 then we end up with\nan orthogonal pair of unit vectors v and w with W \u2217 T v = w and\nW \u2217 T w = \u2212v.\nIf q is a vector in (ker W )\u22a5 that is orthogonal to both v and w then\nW \u2217 T q will be orthogonal to both W \u2217 T v and W \u2217 T w since T preserves\northogonality everywhere and W \u2217 preserves the orthogonality of vectors\nin (ker W \u2217 )\u22a5 . Thus we can create a basis of (ker W )\u22a5 out of pairs\nv1 , W \u2217 T v1 , . . . , vm , W \u2217 T vm .\n\u0003\nWe need some examples of self-dual partial isometries. Treating vectors as 2N-by-1 matrices, if we set\nV = (T v) w\u2217 \u2212 (T w) v\u2217\nthen this rank two (at most) matrix is self-dual since\nV \u266f = \u2212Z (\u2212Zvw\u2217 + Zwv\u2217 )T Z\n= \u2212Z (wv\u2217 Z \u2212 vw\u2217Z) Z\n= Zwv\u2217 \u2212 Zvw\u2217\n= \u2212T (w)v\u2217 + T (v)w\u2217\n= V.\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n18\n\nIf we start with v and w orthogonal, then V will be the rank-two partial\nisometry taking v to T w and w to T v. We record this as a lemma\nthat avoids the ugly notation.\nLemma 7.4. Suppose v and w are orthogonal unit vectors. Then the\npartial isometry from Cv + Cw to CT v + CT w that sends v to T w\nand w to \u2212T v will be self-dual.\n\nTheorem 7.5. If X in M2n (C) satisfies X \u266f = X then there is a unitary\nU so that U \u266f = U and X = U |X|.\n\nProof. Once more W = Xf (X \u2217 X) works to create a partial isometry\nW with X = W P for P = |X| and this time we have W \u266f = W . We\nneed a partial isometry from ker(W ) to ker (W \u2217 ) that is self-dual. The\ndimension of ker(W ) will be even, by Lemma 7.3. Moreover if\nv1 , w1 , . . . , vm , wm\nis an orthogonal basis for ker(W ) then\nT v1 , T w1 , . . . , T vm , T wm\n\nwill be an orthogonal basis for ker (W \u2217 ). The needed self-dual partial\nisometry V will send vj to T wj and wj to T vj and the self-dual unitary\nwe use will be U = W + V .\n\u0003\n8. The odd particle causes even degeneracy\nWe hope not to scare the mathematical reader with more discussion of Kramers degeneracy. What Kramers discovered was that for a\ncertain systems involving a odd number of electrons, the Hamiltonian\nalways had all eigenvalues with even multiplicity.\nA mathematical manifestation of this is that the tensor product of\ntwo dual operations is the transpose operation in disguise. In contrast\nto that, the tensor product of three dual operations is a large dual operation in disguise. Specifically if we implement an orthogonal change\nof basis, the dual operation becomes the transpose.\nThis is essentially the same as the facts that is more familiar to\nmathematicians, that H \u2297R H \u223c\n= M4 (R) and H \u2297R H \u2297R H \u223c\n= M4 (H).\nIn the following, we let ZN be as in (1.4), the matrix that specified\nthe dual operation.\nLemma 8.1. Consider\n1\nU = \u221a (I \u2297 I \u2212 iZN \u2297 ZM ) .\n2\nFor all X \u2208 M2N (C) and Y \u2208 M2M (C),\n\u0001\nU \u2217 X \u266f \u2297 Y \u266f U = (U \u2217 (X \u2297 Y ) U)T .\n\n\fFACTORIZATION OF MATRICES OF QUATERNIONS\n\n19\n\nT\nProof. Since ZK\n= \u2212ZK we see U = U T . Also\n1\nU \u2217 U = (I \u2297 I + iZN \u2297 ZM ) (I \u2297 I \u2212 iZN \u2297 ZM )\n2\n\u0001\n1\n=\nI \u2297 I + (ZN \u2297 ZM )2 = I \u2297 I\n2\nso U is a unitary and U = U \u22121 .\nSince U 2 = \u2212iZN \u2297 ZM we find\n\u0001\n\u0001\nU\u2217 X\u266f \u2297 Y \u266f U = U X\u266f \u2297 Y \u266f U\n\u0001\n= U (\u2212iZN \u2297 ZM ) X T \u2297 Y T (iZN \u2297 ZM ) U\n\u0001 2\n= UU 2 X T \u2297 Y T U U\n\n= (U \u2217 (X \u2297 Y ) U)T .\n\n\u0003\n\nWe have refrained from discussing C \u2217 -algebras, but here they add\nclarity. What the lemma is showing is\n\u0001\n(M2N (C) \u2297 M2M (C), \u266f \u2297 \u266f) \u223c\n= M2(M +N ) (C), T .\n\nLemma 8.2. For all X \u2208 M2N (C) and Y \u2208 M2M (C),\nX T \u2297 Y \u266f = (X \u2297 Y )\u266f\n\nwhere the \u266f on the right is taken with respect to I \u2297 ZM .\nProof. This is much simpler, as\n(X \u2297 Y )\u266f = \u2212 (I \u2297 ZM ) (X \u2297 Y )T (I \u2297 ZM )\n\u0001\n= \u2212 (I \u2297 ZM ) X T \u2297 Y T (I \u2297 ZM )\n\u0001\n= X T \u2297 \u2212ZM Y T ZM .\n\n\u0003\n\nTogether, \u0001 these lemmas show us that a tensor product of three\nM2Nj (C), \u266f leads to something isomorphic to\n\u0001\nM2(N1 +N2 +N3 ) (C), \u266f .\n9.
