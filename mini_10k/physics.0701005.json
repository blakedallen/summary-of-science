We would expect that a preaccelerated charge would radiate so that there would\nbe spontaneous preradiation, an acausal phenomenon. We reexamine the subtle relation between\nthe Larmor formula for the power radiated by a point charge and the Abraham-Lorentz equation\nand find that for well-behaved external forces acting for finite times, the charge does not radiate in\ntime intervals where there is preacceleration. That is, for these forces preradiation does not exist\neven though the charge is preaccelerated. The radiative energy is emitted only in time intervals\nwhen the external force acts on the charge.\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA universally accepted idea is that an accelerated charge radiates. However, Abbott\nand Griffiths1 have found some extended configurations with sinusoidal currents that do\nnot radiate for certain special frequencies for which the external fields are exactly zero.\nThey refer to other work in which similar configurations involving acceleration without\nradiation has been discussed.1 The fact that acceleration without radiation occurs when\nthe external fields are exactly zero cannot be considered a fortuitous result attributable\nto extended configurations. We would expect that a point charge and an extended charge\nwould radiate only when an external force acts on them. To understand why acceleration\nwithout radiation is possible we should also consider the radiation reaction force because\nthe emission of radiation is generally accompanied by a radiation reaction, a recoil force\nattributable to the fields acting back on the charge.\nFor a point charge e of mass m acceleration without radiation when the external force\nvanishes is not supported by the Larmor formula for the instantaneous power radiated:\nP = m\u03c4 a2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = 2e2 /(3mc3 ). The Abraham-Lorentz (AL) equation of motion includes the radiation reaction force:\nma = F + m\u03c4 \u0227,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere F(t) is an external force and a dot means time differentiation. Equation (2) states\nthat the charge can accelerate even when F vanishes and it should radiate because of Eq. (1).\nIt is generally believed that radiation without the intervention of an external force occurs\nin the preacceleration effect.2\u20134 To avoid runaway solutions in Eq. (2) we can assume that\na(\u221e) = 0,3 but Eq. (2) predicts preacceleration: the charge accelerates before the force acts\non it. The charge should then radiate because of Eq. (1). Therefore, Eqs. (1) and (2) predict\nthe existence of preradiation: the charge radiates before the external force acts on it.\nAlthough it is difficult to understand how acausal preaccelerations can exist in the context\nof a classical theory, it is even more challenging to understand how spontaneous preradiation\ncan occur. Radiation in classical electrodynamics is expected to be an observable quantity.\nBut how can radiation be detected when we have still not acted on the charge? No direct or\nindirect experimental evidence of acausal preradiation has been reported. The existence of\n2\n\n\fpreradiation could be questioned because we can have acceleration without radiation when\nthe external fields are zero.1\nIn this paper we reexamine the subtle relation between Eqs. (1) and (2) and find that\nfor well-behaved external forces acting for finite times, the charge does not radiate in time\nintervals where there is preacceleration. That is, for these forces preradiation does not exist\neven though the charge is preaccelerated. The radiative energy is emitted only in time\nintervals when the external force acts on the charge.\n\nII.\n\nTHE PRERADIATION PHENOMENON\n\nWe review examples of preradiation for the following external forces: (A) Dirac delta\nforce; (B) well-behaved force acting on a finite time; (C) periodical force acting on entire\ncycles and (D) constant force acting on a finite time. Examples (A) and (D) are problems\nof Griffith's textbook.4\u20137 Examples (C) and (D) are special cases of the example (B).\n\nA.\n\nThe Dirac delta force\n\nPreradiation can be illustrated by an example due to Dirac2 in which a charge is disturbed\nby a momentary pulse represented by a delta function acting only at t = 0:5\nF (t) = k\u03b4(t),\nwhere k > 0. The nonrunaway solution of Eq. (2) for this force is given by:5\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2ket/\u03c4 /(m\u03c4 ) (t < 0)\na(t) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30.\n(t > 0)\n\nThe total radiated energy in the interval (t1 , t2 ) is calculated with the formula\nZ t2\na2 dt.\nWR (t1 , t2 ) = m\u03c4\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nt1\n\nFor the force in Eq. (3) the total radiated energy is given by:5\nk2\n,\nWR (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) = WR (\u2212\u221e, 0) =\n2m\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is radiated only during the preacceleration interval (\u2212\u221e, 0). Equation (6) is an\nexample of pure preradiation.\n3\n\n\fB.\n\nWell-behaved external force\n\nPreradiation seems to exist for a more realistic external force beginning at t = 0 and\nlasting until t = T ,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0\n(t \u2264 0)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nF(t) = f(t), (0 \u2264 t \u2264 T )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30\nt\u2265T\n\n(7)\n\nwhere f(t) is a well-behaved function of time. We note that Eq. (7) represents a family of\nforces. By assuming the condition a(\u221e) = 0, we can obtain the nonrunaway solution of\nEq. (2) for the force in Eq. (7):\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4[g(T ) \u2212 g(0)]et/\u03c4 , (t \u2264 0)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\na(t) = [g(T ) \u2212 g(t)]et/\u03c4 , (0 \u2264 t \u2264 T )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30,\n(t \u2265 T )\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the function g(t) is given by\n\n1\ng(t) =\nm\u03c4\n\nZ\n\ne\u2212t/\u03c4 f(t)dt.\n\n(9)\n\nThe total radiated energy WR (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) is obtained by adding the contributions in the intervals (\u2212\u221e, 0) and (0, T ). Note that WR (T, \u221e) = 0. From Eqs. (5) and (8) we obtain\nZ T\nm\u03c4 2\n2\nWR (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) =\n[g(T ) \u2212 g(0)] + m\u03c4\n[g(T ) \u2212 g(t)]2 e2t/\u03c4 dt.\n(10)\n2\n0\nThe first term in Eq. (10) is the energy radiated in the interval (\u2212\u221e, 0) and the second term\nis the energy radiated in the interval (0, T ). The external force does not act in (\u2212\u221e, 0),\nbut in this interval the charge is preaccelerated (see Eq. (8)) yielding the radiative energy\nappearing in the first term of Eq. (10), which represents another example of preradiation.\n\nC.\n\nPeriodical external force\n\nAs a special case of Eq. (7) we consider the periodic force acting for n cycles:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0,\n(t \u2264 0)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nF (t) = k sin(\u03c9t), (0 \u2264 t \u2264 T )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f30,\n(t \u2265 T )\n4\n\n(11)\n\n\fwhere T = 2n\u03c0/\u03c9. In this case Eq. (9) takes the form\ng(t) = \u2212\n\nke\u2212t/\u03c4\n[\u03c9\u03c4 cos(\u03c9t) + sin(\u03c9t)].\nm(1 + \u03c9 2 \u03c4 2 )\n\n(12)\n\nThe nonrunaway solution of Eq. (2) when the external force is specified by Eq. (11) can be\nobtained from Eqs. (8) and (12):\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03b1[et/\u03c4 \u2212 e(t\u2212T )/\u03c4 ],\n(t \u2264 0)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\na(t) = \u03b1[sin(\u03c9t)/\u03c9\u03c4 + cos(\u03c9t) \u2212 e(t\u2212T )/\u03c4 ], (0 \u2264 t \u2264 T )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0,\n(t \u2265 T )\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = k\u03c9\u03c4 /(m[1 + \u03c9 2 \u03c4 2 ]). From Eqs. (5) and (13) or from Eqs. (10) and (12) we can\nobtain the total radiated energy:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT\nm\u03c4 2 \u03b12\nT\nm\u03c4 2 \u03b12\n\u2212T /\u03c4 2\n\u22122T /\u03c4\n1+ + 3 2 \u2212e\n,\n(1 \u2212 e\n) +\nWR (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) =\n2\n2\n\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u03c9\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the first term on the right-hand side is the preradiative energy emitted during the\ninterval (\u2212\u221e, 0) and the second term is the energy radiated in the interval (0, T ). After a\nsimple calculation, Eq. (14) becomes\n\u0012\n\u0013\nT\nT\nm\u03c4 2 \u03b12\n\u2212T /\u03c4\n2 + + 3 2 \u2212 2e\n.\nWR (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) =\n2\n\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u03c9\n\n(15)\n\nTo verify that the energy is conserved in the interval (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) we first need to find the\nvelocities associated with Eq. (13).

(24c) shows that the energy is conserved, that is, the work done by the external force is\nequal to the change of kinetic energy plus the total radiated energy.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE NON-EXISTENCE OF THE PRERADIATION PHENOMENON\n\nIn Sec. II we have presented examples of acausal preradiative terms. However, acausal\nterms are physically unacceptable in purely classical considerations. Consistence of classical\nelectrodynamics demands that acausal terms should not contribute to observable quantities.8\nTherefore, the acausal preradiative terms should be natural and systematically eliminated\nfrom the total radiative energy.\nWe note in particular that the second term in Eq. (21) can be written as\nk2\u03c4\nk2 \u03c4 2\nk2\u03c4 2\n(\u22123 + 2T /\u03c4 + 4e\u2212T /\u03c4 \u2212 e\u22122T /\u03c4 ) =\n(T \u2212 \u03c4 + \u03c4 e\u2212T /\u03c4 ) \u2212\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212T /\u03c4 )2 .\n2m\nm\n2m\n\n(25)\n\nThe last term of Eq. (25) exactly cancels the first (preradiative) term: k 2 \u03c4 2 (1\u2212e\u2212T /\u03c4 )2 /(2m)\nof Eq. (21) so that Eqs. (21) and (25) imply Eq. (22) for the total radiated energy. A similar\ncancellation of the preradiative term in Eq. (14) occurs, that is, the second term of Eq. (14)\ncontains a part that exactly cancels its first (preradiative) term so that the total energy\nradiated is given by Eq. (15). Equation (25) seems to be the result of an integration by\nparts. Therefore, let us consider an integration by parts for the general case given by\nEq. (10). After integration by parts, we see that the second term in Eq. (10):\nZ T\nZ T\nm\u03c4 2\n2 2t/\u03c4\nm\u03c4\n[g(T ) \u2212 g(t)] e dt = \u03c4\n[g(T ) \u2212 g(t)]et/\u03c4 * f(t)dt \u2212\n[g(T ) \u2212 g(0)]2 ,\n2\n0\n0\n\n(26)\n\ncontains a part that exactly cancels its first (preradiative) term, so that Eqs. (10) and (26)\ngive the effective radiated energy\nWR (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) = \u03c4\n\nZ\n\nT\n\n[g(T ) \u2212 g(t)]et/\u03c4 * f(t) dt.\n0\n\n7\n\n(27)\n\n\fWe can verify Eq. (27) for the force in Eq. (11). If we use Eqs. (11) and (12) in Eq. (27),\nwe obtain the result given in Eq. (15):\nZ T h\ni\nsin(\u03c9t)\nWR (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) = \u03c4\n\u03b1\n+ cos(\u03c9t) \u2212 e(t\u2212T )/\u03c4 k sin(\u03c9t) dt\n\u03c9\u03c4\n0\ni\n2 2h\nm\u03c4 \u03b1\nT\nT\n=\n2 + + 3 2 \u2212 2e\u2212T /\u03c4 .\n2\n\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u03c9\n\n(28a)\n(28b)\n\nEquations (10) and (27) represent the same energy, but the trouble with Eq. (10) is that\nit explicitly exhibits a misleading time separation of energy in the interval of preacceleration\n(\u2212\u221e, 0) and the interval (0, T ), although Eq. (27) shows that the energy is radiated only\nduring (0, T ) which is the interval when the force acts. We conclude that there is no effective\nenergy radiated during (\u2212\u221e, 0), which is the interval when there is preacceleration. In other\nwords: there does not exist preradiation for the family of external forces specified by Eq. (7),\neven though the charge is preaccelerated.\nRohrlich9 has emphasized that there are many equations that have multiple solutions\nsome of which are not realized in nature, and we should distinguish between the existence of\na mathematical solution and its physical existence. For instance, the AL equation has two\nsolutions: a = 0 and a(t) = a(0)et/\u03c4 , but only the former is physically possible. Advanced\nsolutions of Maxwell's equations violating the causality principle are another example of\nsolutions that are not physical. Analogously, acausal preaccelerations (of well-behaved external forces) exist mathematically (as an implication of the AL equation) but not physically\nbecause they do not originate radiation.\n\nIV.\n\nPRERADIATION AND THE KINETIC-RADIATIVE ENERGY\n\nWe note that the preradiative term in Eq. (10) effectively depends on the value of the\nacceleration at t = 0:\nWR (\u2212\u221e, 0) =\n\nm\u03c4 2 [a(0)]2\nm\u03c4 2\n[g(T ) \u2212 g(0)]2 =\n.\n2\n2\n\n(29)\n\nIt follows that from a formal point of view the elimination of preradiation implied by Eqs.\n(10) and (26) occurs at t = 0. To find how is the general dependence of the preradiative\nenergies with respect the values of the acceleration, let us separate the interval of preacceleration (\u2212\u221e, 0) into the intervals (\u2212\u221e, \u2212t0 ) and (\u2212t0 , 0). After a simple calculation, we find\nWR (\u2212\u221e, \u2212t0 ) = m\u03c4 2 [a(\u2212t0 )]2 /2 and WR (\u2212t0 , 0) = m\u03c4 2 ([a(0)]2 \u2212 [a(\u2212t0 )]2 ) /2. The latter\n8\n\n\fterm depends on the value of the acceleration at the initial and final times of the interval\n(\u2212t0 , 0). But the time \u2212t0 is arbitrary and thus we have here a first lesson on preradiation:\nthe energy emitted during the interval of preacceleration depends on the initial and final\nvalues of the acceleration in that interval.\nEquations (15) and (22) are examples of energy radiated by a charge during the interval\n(\u2212\u221e, \u221e). To calculate these energies we have essentially combined Eqs. (1) and (2), assumed\nthe condition a(\u221e) = 0 and integrated from t = \u2212\u221e to t = \u221e. The justification for the\ncombination of Eqs. (1) and (2) is that the emission of radiation is generally accompanied\nby a radiation reaction. The justification for the assumption a(\u221e) = 0 is that it implies\nnonrunaway solutions. The justification for the integration over all time is that radiation is\na process that occurs during a time interval rather than at one time.\nTo generalize the method used to obtain Eqs. (15) and (22), we identify the acceleration\nin Eq. (1) with that appearing in Eq. (2) and obtain:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd m\u03c4 2 a2\nP = \u03c4a * F +\n.\ndt\n2\n\n(30)\n\nIn analogy to the kinetic energy T = mv 2 /2, we define the kinetic-radiative energy as\nTR =\n\nm\u03c4 2 a2\n.\n2\n\n(31)\n\nTherefore\nP = \u03c4a * F +\n\ndTR\n.\ndt\n\n(32)\n\nThe integration of Eq. (32) over the interval (t1 , t2 ) gives the energy radiated during that\ninterval:\nWR (t1 , t2 ) = \u03c4\n\nZ\n\nt2\n\na * F dt + \u2206TR (t1 , t2 ),\n\n(33)\n\nt1\n\nwhere \u2206TR (t1 , t2 ) = TR (t2 ) \u2212 TR (t1 ). If the force vanishes in the interval (t1 , t2 ) then\nWR (t1 , t2 ) = \u2206TR (t1 , t2 ),\n\n(34)\n\naccording to which the radiated energy in (t1 , t2 ) is given by the change of the kineticradiative energy in that interval. In particular, preradiation occurs when the external force\nis zero and therefore the preradiative terms satisfy Eq. (34). We have here a second lesson on\npreradiation which makes more precise the first lesson: the energy emitted in the interval of\npreacceleration (t1 , t2 ) is given by the change of the kinetic-radiative energy in that interval.\n9\n\n\fA well-behaved force subject only to the condition that it is switched on in the distant\npast and switched off in the distant future, that is, f(\u00b1\u221e) = 0, is physically realizable.\nIn solving Eq. (2) for the force in Eq. (7) we imposed the condition3 a(\u221e) = 0 to obtain\nthe nonrunaway solution (8), which implies the condition a(\u2212\u221e) = 0. In other words: the\nnonrunaway solutions of Eq. (2) for well-behaved forces satisfy the boundary conditions\na(\u00b1\u221e) = 0,10 which indicate that the charge begins and ends the motion as a free particle11\nand imply \u2206TR (\u00b1\u221e) = 0. We have here a third lesson on preradiation: the nonrunaway\nsolutions of the AL equation for well-behaved external forces satisfy \u2206TR (\u00b1\u221e) = 0 and\ntherefore the associated preradiative energy is vanished.\nOn the other hand, if the solution of Eq. (2) in the interval (t1 , t2 ) is such that it vanishes\nat t = t1 and t = t2 then \u2206TR (t1 , t2 ) = 0 and Eq. (31) reduces to the expression\nZ t2\na * F dt,\nWR (t1 , t2 ) = \u03c4\n\n(35)\n\nt1\n\nwhich causally links the radiated energy with the external force in such a way that the energy\nis radiated only in the interval when the force acts. From Eqs. (5) and (35) we obtain\nZ t2\nZ t2\n2\na * F dt + \u2206TR (t1 , t2 ),\n(36)\na dt = \u03c4\nm\u03c4\nt1\n\nt1\n\nwhich shows that the subtle difference between Eqs. (5) and (35) is that the latter equation\nimplicitly assumes \u2206TR (t1 , t2 ) = 0.\nLet us now apply Eq. (35) to the family of forces specified by Eq. (7). The associated\nnonrunaway solution satisfies \u2206TR (\u00b1\u221e) = 0. If Eqs. (7) and (8) are used in Eq. (35) with\nt1 = \u2212\u221e and t2 = \u221e, we obtain the result in Eq. (27):\nZ T\nWR (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) = \u03c4\n[g(T ) \u2212 g(t)]et/\u03c4 * f(t) dt.\n\n(37)\n\n0\n\nV.\n\nENERGY CONSERVATION\n\nTo verify that the energy is conserved in the time interval (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) if the external force\nis given by Eq. (7), we need to find the velocities associated with Eq. (8). By assuming\nv(\u2212\u221e) = 0, we find\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03c4 [g(T ) \u2212 g(0)]et/\u03c4 ,\n(t \u2264 0)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\nv(t) = V(t) \u2212 V(0) + \u03c4 [g(T ) \u2212 g(t)]et/\u03c4 , (0 \u2264 t \u2264 T )\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3V(T ) \u2212 V(0),\n(t \u2265 T )\n10\n\n(38)\n\n\fwhere V(t) is the velocity of the charge when the radiation reaction is not considered. The\nwork done by the external force (7) is then given by\nZ \u221e\nZ T\nWext =\nf(t) * v(t)dt =\nf(t) * v(t)dt\n\u2212\u221e\n0\nZ T\nm(v(T ))2\n=\n+\u03c4\nf(t) * [g(T ) \u2212 g(t)]et/\u03c4 dt.\n2\n0\n\n(39a)\n(39b)\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (39b) is the fina kinetic energy (the initial is\nassumed to be zero) and the second term is the total radiated energy given by Eq. (37).\nEquation (39b) indicates that the energy is conserved in the interval (\u2212\u221e, \u221e), that is, the\nwork done by the external force equals the change of kinetic energy plus the total radiated\nenergy. It follows that energy conservation in Eq. (39b) supports the conclusion that the\nenergy is radiated only during the interval when the force acts. Applications of Eq. (39b)\nare given by Eqs. (17c) and (24c).\n\nVI.\n\nDISCONTINUOUS FORCES\n\nWe have successfully applied Eq. (27) to the force (7) which is not differentiable at t = 0\nand t = T . We can also apply Eq. (27) to the force (18) which is not continuous at t = 0\nand t = T . If we use Eqs. (18) and (20) in Eq. (27) and integrate from \u03b5 to T \u2212 \u03b5, we have\nZ T \u2212\u03b5 2\nk2 \u03c4\nk \u03c4\n(1 \u2212 e(t\u2212T )/\u03c4 )dt =\n(\u22122\u03b5 + T + \u03c4 e\u03b5\u2212T /\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 e\u2212\u03b5/\u03c4 ).\n(40)\nWR (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) =\nm\nm\n\u03b5\nAfter taking the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0, we obtain the result given in Eq. (22).7\nWe should not apply directly Eq. (27) to the delta function force in Eq. (3) because in\nthis case the associated acceleration is not continuous at t = 0. In this case we can apply\nEq. (34) with t1 = \u2212\u221e to t2 = \u2212\u03b5. The result is\nk 2 \u22122\u03b5/\u03c4\nWR (\u2212\u221e, \u2212\u03b5) =\ne\n,\n2m\n\n(41)\n\nwhich represents apparent preradiation. However, we observe that WR in Eq. (41) can\nbe considered as an effective function of \u03b5. Therefore we can write WR = Weff (\u03b5) =\nk 2 e\u22122\u03b5/\u03c4 /(2m). In the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0, we obtain Weff (0) = k 2 /(2m), that is, Eq. (6). Thus the\nenergy is radiated at t = 0, the only time at which the delta function force acts and hence\npreradiation is also eliminated in this case. Of course, Eq. (27) and more generally Eq. (33)\napply to continuously differentiable forces.\n11\n\n\fVII.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nPreaccelerations are commonly ignored by appealing to the argument that for electrons\nthey occur in times so small (of order \u03c4 = 6.24 \u00d7 10\u221224 s) that they would be practically unobservable. Preaccelerations have also been connected with the point charge model assumed\nin the derivation of the AL equation so that the classical electrodynamics of a point charge\nseems to be a questionable theory.12 The idea of abandoning the point charge model to avoid\npreacceleration has been successfully developed by several authors.12,13 Here we have demonstrated that for well-behaved external forces acting over finite times, a preaccelerated point\ncharge does not have radiative effects, which is consistent with the idea that preacceleration\nexists mathematically but not physically. Preradiation is eliminated because the nonrunaway solutions of the AL equation for well-behaved external forces satisfy \u2206TR (\u00b1\u221e) = 0,\nwhere TR = m\u03c4 2 a2 /2 is the kinetic-radiative energy. The radiative energy is emitted only\nin time intervals when the external force acts on the charge.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author thanks Professor R. F. O'Connell for useful discussions.

However, Ford and O'Connell have obtained Eq. (2)\nwithout using \u2206ES = 0. See, G. W. Ford and R. F. O'Connell, \"Radiation reaction in electrodynamics and the elimination of runaway solutions,\" Phys. Lett. A 157, 217\u2013220 (1991).\n\n11\n\nThe condition in the distant future a(\u221e) = 0 in Eq. (2) fixes the condition in the distant past\na(\u2212\u221e) = 0 if well-behaved external forces, f (\u00b1\u221e) = 0, are considered. If instead, we consider\nthese same forces and assume a(\u2212\u221e) = 0, then the solution of Eq. (2) in the distant future\nbecomes infinite, a(\u221e) = \u221e. In this sense the physics of the AL equation is consistent with the\nidea that the future determines the past. We note also that f (\u00b1\u221e) = 0 and a(\u00b1\u221e) = 0 are\nsufficient conditions to guarantee the vanishing of the radiation reaction force m\u03c4 \u0227 at t = \u00b1\u221e.\n\n12\n\nR. F.
