Associated with luminous early type (E/S0) galaxies, they often have relativistic jets originating\nin the nucleus near a supermassive black hole (SMBH) thought to power the enourmous\nenergy output (eg. Blandford 1984). Depending upon the jet morphology, the galaxies are\nclassified as FR I (edge darkened) or FR II (edge brightened) sources (Fanaroff & Riley\n1974). The core and jet structures have been mapped at various radio frequencies (e.g. Xu\net al. 2000; Giovannini et al. 2005), from a few hundred MHz to several GHz. But radio\ncontinuum observations at millimeter wavelengths (\u223c 100 GHz) are relatively rare (Wright\n& Birkinshaw 1984; Salter et al. 1989; Evans et al. 1999a; Looney & Hardcastle 2000;\nHardcastle & Looney 2001).\nMolecular gas has been detected at millimeter wavelengths in several nearby radio loud\ngalaxies (Lim et al. 2003; Leon et al. 2003; Lim et al. 2000; Evans et al. 1999a, 1999b;\nMazzarella et al. 1993; Mirabel, Sanders & Kazes 1989; Philips et al. 1987); the mass of\ndetected molecular gas is in the range \u223c108 \u20131010 M\u2299 . The molecular gas mass is usually\nlarger than that seen in radio quiet or normal ellipticals, where the gas mass appears in\nthe range \u223c108 \u2013109 M\u2299 (Lees et al. 1991; Wiklind, Combes & Henkel 1995; Knapp &\nRupen 1996; Young 2002). Higher angular resolution observations which map and resolve\nthe molecular gas distribution exist for only a few radio galaxies so far: Centaurus A (Eckart\net al. 1990), 3C 84 (Inoue et al. 1996), 3C 293 (Evans et al. 1999a), PKS 1345+12 (Evans et\nal. 1999b) and 3C 31 (Okuda et al. 2005). These observations indicate that the gas is nearly\nalways concentrated in a disk associated with the nuclear region. In at least one case (3C\n293), the gas has a disturbed morphology (Evans et al 1999a). The detection of large masses\nof molecular gas in radio galaxies and the location of this gas in the nucleus suggest that the\ngas provides a resevoir for fueling the AGN and powering the relativistically beamed jets.\nHowever, many questions regarding jets in radio galaxies remain. For example, what is\nthe origin of the gas feeding the AGN, how is the gas transported into the nuclear region, and\nwhat determines the luminosity of the AGN? X-ray observations indicate that radio galaxies\ncan create bubbles and shells within the X-ray emitting gas in clusters of galaxies (e.g. Heinz,\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nReynolds & Begelman 1998; Fabian et al. 2003). Thus jets from radio galaxies may play\na significant role in heating the intracluster gas (see for example Reynolds et al. 2005 and\nreferences therein). The role of jets may be particularly prominent in less rich clusters or\ngroups where gravitational heating is not as strong, and it is therefore of particular interest\nto observe jets and their interactions with gas in such systems.\nTo address some of these questions we have undertaken a study of molecular gas and\nmillimeter continuum emission in several nearby radio loud galaxies. In this paper we present\nthe first case in this study, NGC 3801 (UGC 06635). NGC 3801 is a nearby early type galaxy,\nvariously classified as an elliptical or an S0 galaxy, located in a group of approximately ten\ngalaxies; its basic properties are listed in Table 1. It is a radio bright galaxy with radio jets\noriginating from the nucleus approximately normal to a central dust lane. It is classified as\nan FR I type radio source and has the classic edge-darkened jet structure typical of its class.\nThe galaxy has been extensively imaged with the HST WFPC2 camera by Verdoes Kleijn\net al. (1999). They find a prominent dust lane in the galaxy center with several associated\nfilamentary structures; there are several knots of H\u03b1 emission along the main dust lane that\nlikely trace star forming regions. The radio jets have been mapped with the VLA at 1.5 GHz\n(Wrobel & Condon 1989); they extend out to a distance of \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus. The\nradio core is not detected with the VLA. HI has been detected toward NGC 3801 using the\nArecibo radio telescope, with a total estimated HI mass of 2.1 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 (Heckman et al.\n1983; Duprie & Schneider 1996). Leon et al. (2003) detected molecular gas in the center of\nNGC 3801; their single dish CO observations show that the line profile has a horn-shaped\nstructure indicative of gas rotating in a disk or torus. They estimate a molecular gas mass\nof \u223c 3.8 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 in their 21\u2032\u2032 beam. We adopt a distance of D = 47.9 Mpc for NGC 3801\n(Vsys = 3451 km s\u22121 ), which leads to a scale of 0.23 kpc arcsec\u22121 .\nIn this paper we present a map of the molecular gas distribution in NGC 3801 using\nthe BIMA millimeter-wave array. We have also detected the compact radio core in the\ncenter of the galaxy, which was not detected in lower frequency VLA observations. We\nhave investigated the continuum emission at two other frequencies in the 3 mm window\nto determine whether the core emission has a flat or steep spectrum. This will help to\nunderstand whether the continuum emission is from an AGN.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS, DATA REDUCTION, AND MAPS\n\nWe observed NGC 3801 with the BIMA interferometer (Welch et al. 1996) in the C and\nD configurations from 2003 July to 2003 September. The observations were all obtained in\nsingle-pointing mode with a 100\u2032\u2032 field of view centered on the galaxy nucleus. The 114.2\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nGHz frequency of redshifted CO (1\u20130) was positioned in the upper sideband. We used the\nwideband correlator setting, which gives a velocity resolution of 50 km s\u22121 and a velocity\nrange of \u223c2000 km s\u22121 , covering 2100 to 4055 km s\u22121 ; this setting gives a lower velocity\nresolution than narrow band modes, but the large velocity width enables subtraction of the\ncontinuum emission to obtain a map of CO (1\u20130) line emission alone. We used the quasar 3C\n273 for flux calibration. The flux of 3C 273 is monitored regularly with BIMA and varied by\napproximately 10% during the period of observation; additional errors are introduced when\nthe flux calibration is transferred to the source. So the total error in the flux estimate is of\nthe order of 10 to 20%. The radio source 1159+292 was used for phase calibration. Emission\nin the wideband channels is sufficiently bright that it could be used to self-calibrate the\ninstrumental phases; self-calibration produced modest improvement in the images, and was\nused for the maps produced here. All interferometric data obtained with BIMA were reduced\nusing MIRIAD (Sault, Teuben & Wright 1995).\n\n2.1.\n\n3 mm Continuum Emission and Spectral Index Maps\n\nTo obtain the continuum emission map, we flagged channels containing CO (1\u20130) line\nemission and recomputed the continuum channels from the narrow band dataset. We then\naveraged the upper sideband (\u223c114.3 GHz) and the lower sideband (\u223c110.6 GHz). The mean\nfrequency of the continuum emission map is thus 112.4 GHz, corresponding to a wavelength\nof 2.7 mm. Figure 1 shows two maps of the distribution of 2.7 mm continuum emission\nin NGC 3801. Both maps combine data from the C and D arrays, but the map in the\nleft panel is optimized for maximum sensitivity and flux recovery (using natural weighting)\nand the other compromises sensitivity slightly to achieve better resolution (using robust=0.5\nweighting). The synthesized beam full width at half maximum diameters are 12 \u00d7 10\u2032\u2032 and\n10 \u00d7 8\u2032\u2032 , respectively.\nTo derive the spectral index of mm-wave continuum emission, we carried out additional\nBIMA observations at two new frequencies, 86 and 110 GHz. Although the 110 GHz frequency is not very different from the 112.4 GHz frequency used for the maps shown in this\npaper, we decided to observe two frequencies simultaneously so as to minimize the effect of\ncalibration uncertainties, including those resulting from flux variations of the quasar used\nfor flux calibration. We observed at 110 GHz rather than 112.4 GHz because the sensitivity\nimproves away from the atmospheric oxygen band just beyond the CO (1\u20130) line. The spectral index observations were obtained in 2003 November using the C array in single-pointing\nmode with the wideband correlator setting. In order to use the same beam size for all frequencies, in making the spectral index maps we restricted the uv range of the visibilities\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nto the same range, 2 k\u03bb to 31 k\u03bb. We used natural weighting. Even with the uv range\nrestriction, the beam sizes were slightly different, and so we convolved all maps to the lowest\nresolution, 13.0\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 7.5\u2032\u2032 .\nAlso, we used VLA 20 cm (1.5 GHz) archival data and our BIMA 2.7 mm map to\ndetermine the spectral index between millimeter and centimeter wavelengths. The highest\nresolution VLA map has a resolution of 1.5\u2032\u2032 and is shown in the upper left of Figure 2\nand was obtained by Wrobel & Condon (1989). The faint diagonal striping is probably an\nartifact of incomplete uv coverage in the A array; the bend in both jets is not an artifact. In\nthe upper right, we show a VLA B array 20 cm map at 4\u2032\u2032 emission that has been convolved\nto match the 10\u00d78\u2032\u2032 of the BIMA 2.7 mm map shown in Figure 1b.\n\n2.2.\n\nCO (1\u20130) Emission\n\nFor the CO line emitting gas distribution, we need to subtract the continuum emission.\nAs noted earlier, CO was observed in the upper sideband. The continuum maps presented\nin Figure 1 contain emission from the lower side band and so were not used. Instead, we\nformed a continuum map from off-line channels (2100 to 2900 km s\u22121 ) in the upper sideband,\nand used that for continuum subtraction. The velocity-integrated CO (1\u20130) emission map,\nformed by taking the zeroth moment of the emission, is shown in Figure 3. Flux from pixels\nwith absolute value less than 9 mJy beam\u22121 (1.1\u03c3) was not included in the map shown.\nWe note that clipping results in some of the flux being excluded from the map, and so in\ncomputing fluxes we used unclipped maps. The resolution of the natural-weighted map is\n12\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032\u2032 .\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nRESULTS\n\nRadio Continuum Core and Jet Emission\n\nThe distribution of 2.7 mm (114 GHz) continuum emission is shown in Figure 1. As\ndescribed in Section 2.1, the right panel shows a robust-weighted map (10 \u00d7 8\u2032\u2032 ), while the\nleft panel shows a natural-weighted map with slightly lower resolution (12 \u00d7 10\u2032\u2032 ) but with\nbetter sensitivity. The total 2.7 mm flux in the natural-weighted map is 51 mJy. The maps\nreveal that the source has both an unresolved core and extended structure.\nIn Figure 4, the natural-weighted 2.7 mm map (contours) is overlaid on the A-array\nVLA 20 cm (1.5 GHz) image. Here it can be seen that the 2.7 mm extended emission is\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nsimilar in position angle (PA \u223c 120\u25e6 ) and extent (radius \u223c 15\u2032\u2032 ) to the jet-like distribution\nevident in the 20 cm data. Although there is also 20 cm emission at the position of the\n2.7 mm core, it is possible that this is entirely due to the jets. A radio core source has not\npreviously been noted in NGC 3801; in particular, Xu et al. (2000) used VLA data taken by\nWrobel and Condon to set an upper limit of 0.8 mJy on the 20 cm flux of the core source.\nFirst we discuss the extended emission. Xu et al. (2000) classified NGC 3801 as a\ntwin jet source on the basis of the centimeter wave VLA data, and noted that twin jet or\ncore-jet structures are common in FR I radio galaxies. However, at millimeter wavelengths\njets have only been detected in a few radio galaxies (e.g. Cygnus A: Wright & Birkinshaw\n1984; 3C20: Hardcastle & Looney 2001; M87: Salter et al. 1989). Our detection of a core-jet\nstructure in the FR I galaxy NGC 3801 at millimeter wavelengths is thus an important step\nin understanding of radio galaxies.\nThe curvature in the jets at 20 cm is also faintly seen in the BIMA 2.7 mm map.\nThe curvature may indicate that the jets are precessing or deflected by irregularities in the\ninterstellar medium of the galaxy (e.g. Merritt & Ekers 2002; Schmitt et al. 2002; Caproni &\nAbraham 2004; Hardee et al. 1994). In Figure 6, we overlay the VLA 20 cm map (contours)\non the HST V-band image obtained by Verdoes Kleijn et al (1999). As noted by Verdoes\nKleijn et al., the jets are at a position angle (PA) of 120\u25e6 , roughly perpendicular to the\ndisk-like dust filament at PA=24\u25e6 passing near the nucleus. The figure also shows that the\npeak emission in the SE jet appears to coincide with the innermost extent of the long, well\ndefined SE dust filament. We discuss this association further in Section 3.2.\nIn order to determine the cm to mm wave spectral index of the jets, we convolved the\n1.5 20 cm VLA map to the 10 \u00d7 8\u2032\u2032 resolution of the BIMA 2.7 mm (112.4 GHz) map, as\ndescribed in Section 2. The smoothed 20 cm map is shown in Figure 2 (upper right); a\nspectral index map formed from the ratio of the 2.7 mm map to the 20 cm map is shown in\nthe lower left of the figure. The spectral index is \u22120.77 at the SE peak of cm-wave emission\nand \u22120.75 at the NW peak; it lies close to these values everywhere except closer to the\nnucleus where core emission contaminates jet emission, and near the edges where the signal\nto noise is not as good. The spectral index is similar to those measured in samples of FR I\nsources at much longer wavelengths (e.g. Parma et al. 1999), and is further discussed in\nSection 4.\n\u2032\u2032\n\nNow we return to the millimeter-wave core source. As previously noted, this source was\nclassified as a \"twin-jet\" source, not a \"core-jet\" source, by Xu et al. (2000) on the basis of\nthe existing 1.5\u2032\u2032 20 cm VLA data. Among their sample of \u223c20 nearby low-luminosity FR I\nradio galaxies, NGC 3801 has the third highest VLA 20 cm flux from the core-jet region. Yet\nit is among three galaxies in their sample with no detection of a core source, with an upper\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nlimit for the core source of 0.8 mJy, an order of magnitude below the 17 core detections.\nAt 2.7 mm, the core is very clearly detected, with a S/N of 18 at the peak position\nin the natural-weighted map (Figure 1). Within the errors (estimated at 1\u2032\u2032 for the BIMA\nmap), the position of peak 2.7 mm emission coincides with the nuclear position given in\nthe near-IR 2MASS galaxy catalog (Jarrett et al. 2003), as shown in Figure 1. The flux\nat the position of the nucleus in the higher resolution 10 \u00d7 8\u2032\u2032 map, which better resolves\nthe core, is 18.0 mJy beam\u22121 . However, there is likely to be some contamination from jet\nemission. One way to separate unresolved emission from more extended emission is in the\nuv plane; however, the signal to noise is not sufficient for this. Instead we use the 20 cm\nmap, which is completely dominated by jet emission, to estimate contamination from the\njets. The spectral index map shows that the ratio of jet emission at 20 cm to that at 2.7\nmm is very close to 27 everywhere (corresponding to a spectral index of -0.77). We divided\nthe 20 cm map shown in the upper right of Figure 2 by this factor and subtracted the scaled\n20 cm map from the 2.7 mm map. The result is shown in the lower right of Figure 2. Here\nit can be seen that contamination from jet emission has been cleanly removed. The slight\nextension at a position angle of about 20\u25e6 , perpendicular to the jets, is probably not real.\nThe flux in the 2.7 mm map, after subtracting the jets, is 15 mJy. Since the upper limit for\nthe core at 20 cm is 0.8 mJy, we find that the core is at least 19 times brighter at 2.7 mm,\ncorresponding to a spectral index greater than 0.68.\nTo learn more about the core source, we can investigate its spectral index over the range\nof wavelengths observable within the 3 mm atmospheric window. Figure 8 shows the core\nflux at several frequencies in the 3 mm window. Note that as described in Section 2 these\nobservations were convolved to a common resolution of 13 \u00d7 7.5\u2032\u2032, somewhat larger than that\nused for the core flux estimate at 2.7 mm, and so there is contamination from the jets at the\n20% level. Also, because the map contains data only from the C array, some flux is resolved\nout, resulting in somewhat lower fluxes than in the D plus C array maps shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 8 shows that the 3 mm spectrum is flat to within the errors.\nFigures 1 and 2 (lower right) show that the 2.7 mm continuum peak appears to lie\nabout 1\u2032\u2032 east of the nuclear position given by the 2MASS near-IR peak (Jarrett et al. 2003);\nnote that the 2MASS position is very close to the peak in the HST V-band image (Verdoes\nKleijn et al. 1999). The absolute positional accuracy of interferometers such as BIMA is\ntypically about 10% of the synthesized beam width. Since the beam is about 10\u2032\u2032 , we expect\na positional accuracy of about 1\u2032\u2032 . The errors in the 2MASS position should be smaller\nthan this. Therefore the millimeter-wave continuum and line observations presented here\nshould be shifted about 1\u2032\u2032 west for accurate registration with the optical images shown in\nthis paper.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n3.2.\n\nCO (1\u20130) LINE EMISSION\n\nThe map of CO (1\u20130) velocity-integrated emission from a region 80\u2032\u2032 (18 kpc) on a side\ncentered on NGC 3801 is shown in Figure 3; Figure 6 (lower panel) shows the same CO\nemission contours overlaid on the HST V-band image. The CO emission appears distributed\nin three main clumps, each labeled in Figure 3. The HST V-band image shows a straight\nprominent dust lane, measured to have a position angle (PA) of 24\u25e6 by Verdoes Kleijn et al.\n(1999), which is offset approximately 1\u2032\u2032 west of the nucleus. CO clump A appears associated\nwith the prominent NE extension of this filament. CO clump B is roughly coincident with\nthe SW filament, although it appears offset by a couple of arc seconds to the east. It is\npossible that this offset is simply a result of low signal to noise. However, we note that the\nCO brightnesses of clumps A and B are similar but the SW dust filament is not as dark; this\nsuggests the clump B gas may be located more towards the far side of the galaxy. Also, the\nmajor axis of the gaseous disk passes through the nucleus as might be expected, in contrast\nto the dust filament. We discuss the geometry of the nuclear disk later in the next section.\nClump C also appears to be associated with a dust filament: it peaks near the inner\nend of the well defined east filament that is oriented perpendicular to the filament associated\nwith clumps A and B. The signal to noise is too low to determine whether the clump is\nextended.\nThe entire CO (1\u20130) emitting complex extends over nearly \u223c 30\u2032\u2032 , with the peaks of\nclump A and B emission separated by about 20\u2032\u2032 . Assuming a distance of 47.9 Mpc for NGC\n3801, the molecular gas extends over a region nearly \u223c7 kpc across, with the peaks of the\nA and B clumps separated by approximately 4.6 kpc. The spectrum of the 30 \u00d7 40\u2032\u2032 region\ncentered on the nucleus is shown in Figure 5; emission is detected over a range of about 600\nkm s\u22121 .\nThe velocity-integrated CO (1\u20130) fluxes (SCO ) of the three clumps are similar, and are\nlisted in Table 3. Together, the clumps total to SCO = 14.2 Jy km s\u22121 ; this is similar to\nthe flux measured by Leon et al. (2003) in the 21\u2032\u2032 IRAM 30-m single-dish beam. Some of\nthe emission we detect is near the half-power response of the 30-m beam, and so the Leon\net al. estimate is probably a lower limit to the total flux. We note in particular that our\nspectrum is more asymmetric than the Leon et al. spectrum. This might be explained if the\nIRAM beam was missing proportionally more of clumps B and C. However the BIMA map\nmay be underestimating the total flux. This is because interferometric estimates of total flux\ntend to miss weak emission (see Helfer et al. 2002 and Helfer et al. 2003 for a discussion of\nthis). To convert the CO fluxes to molecular mass, we use the standard conversion factor\n2\ngiving the molecular mass as Mmol = 1.5 \u00d7 104 DM\npc SCO M\u2299 , where DM pc is the distance\nin Mpc and SCO is the velocity-integrated CO flux in Jy km s\u22121 (e.g. Strong et al. 1988;\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nScoville et al. 1987). Note that this formula includes a factor of 1.36 for helium. We thus\nfind that the three clumps, A, B, C, have masses 1.3, 1.7 and 1.8\u00d7108 M\u2299 (Table 3); since\nthe interferometer may miss some of the flux, these estimates should probably be considered\nlower limits.\nFigure 9 shows CO position-velocity contour plots for two cuts through the nucleus.\nThe upper panel shows a cut at PA=24\u25e6 , parallel to the dust lane passing near the nucleus.\nThis cut passes near the peaks of clumps A and B, which are labeled in the figure. Clump\nA has emission at velocities from 3180 to 3340 km s\u22121 ; clump B emits from 3580 to 3750\nkm s\u22121 . The figure shows a velocity jump between clumps A and B and a velocity gradient\nwithin clump B, suggesting rotation. We discuss the evidence that this is a rotating nuclear\ndisk in Section 4.2. The lower panel shows a cut perpendicular to the first (PA=114\u25e6 ), also\nthrough the nucleus. Clump C appears in this cut, with emission in the range 3470 to 3630\nkm s\u22121 .\nTo interpret these velocities, we need to know the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Values given in the literature for the redshift of NGC 3801 show a wide range; NED lists seven\nredshifts, in the range 3230 to 3460 km s\u22121 . However, not all of these are of similar quality.\nThe Arecibo spectrum in DuPrie and Schneider (1996) is well determined with a good baseline. They report a systemic velocity of 3451 km s\u22121 . Their spectrum also shows absorption\nin the profile. The absorption, spectral baselines of limited extent, and confusion from other\ngalaxies in the group may have confused some earlier HI observations. Given the fact that\nsome of the HI may be due to merging gas and that existing HI observations do not resolve\nthe galaxy, it is important to have confirming estimates of the systemic velocity using stellar tracers. A recent determination by Wegner et al. (2003), based on stellar absorption\nlines using a cross-correlation technique, gives a velocity of 3494 km s\u22121 , with an error of\n70 km s\u22121 . This should avoid the uncertainties resulting from merging or asymmetrically\ndistributed gas, since this determination is based on stars near the galaxy center. Similarly,\nthe redshift for the Updated Zwicky Catalog used for the CfA survey is 3456 km s\u22121 with\nan error of 71 km s\u22121 . We adopt a systemic velocity of 3451 km s\u22121 , the estimate from the\nArecibo HI spectrum.\nThe velocity extent of CO emission is very similar to that of the HI 21 cm profile\nobserved by DuPrie and Schneider (1996). Also, the HI spectrum is in absorption in the\nvelocity range 3460 to 3600 km s\u22121 , which corresponds closely to the velocity range of clump\nC (approximately 3470 to 3630 km s\u22121 ). As mentioned earlier, the C component coincides\nwith the inner part of the eastern dust filament (Figure 6); the large extinction implies that\nthe dust filament and therefore the CO associated with it is on the near side of NGC 3801.\nWe note also that this gas is along the line of sight to the SE radio continuum jet, as seen\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nin Figures 6 and 7. As is also evident in the figures, the 20 cm radio continuum comes\nalmost entirely from the twin radio jets; therefore the 21 cm absorption must be produced\nby gas on the line of sight to the jets. This is very likely to be HI gas in the eastern dust\nfilament, given its overlap with the SE radio jet. The fact that the HI absorption and clump\nC velocities are similar further increases the likelihood of this association, since the clump C\ncoincides with the filament. We therefore conclude that the clump C is associated with the\neast dust filament, which is on the near side of NGC 3801, and that this filament produces\nthe absorption seen in HI. Although the similarity in the position of clump C with the peak\nof the SE radio jet suggests a physical association, it is unclear whether this is the case. We\ndiscuss this further in the next section.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nNature of the AGN Core and Jets\n\nOur BIMA detection of \u223c3 mm continuum emission from the core and jets in NGC\n3801 is one of the key results of this paper, because radio cores and lobes have been detected\nat millimeter wavelengths in so few galaxies to date. Our 3 mm continuum observations\nreveal a bright radio core (Figure 1) which was not detected in 20 cm VLA observations\n(Figure 4). In the sample of 17 FR I galaxies studied by Xu et al. (2000), NGC 3801 was\nthe only galaxy that lacked a VLA core and was hence not observed with the VLBA. One\npossible explanation for the absence of a core source is Doppler deboosting, which occurs\nfor relativistic jets in the plane of the sky; the jets in NGC 3801 are probably close to the\nplane of the sky, given the similarity in fluxes from the two jets even close to the source and\nalso the edge-on orientation of the nuclear disk. However, our BIMA observations clearly\nshow that NGC 3801 has a bright radio core at 3 mm. This implies that the weakness of\ncentimeter-wave emission from the core cannot be attributed to deboosting. Instead it is\nlikely that the core is compact and dense. Synchrotron self absorption scales as \u03bd \u22123 (e.g.\nKrolik 1999) and can explain the absence of centimeter-wave emission. At higher frequencies\nsuch as the 86\u2013114 GHz frequencies observed here, the compact core is optically thin and\nthus appears bright. Synchrotron self absorption has also been observed in other radio cores\n(e.g. Rudnick, Jones & Fiedler 1986). Free-free absorption is also a possibility, but so far it\nis rarely seen in radio galaxies and even then seems to absorb only part of the inner regions\n(e.g., Walker et al. 2000; Jones et al. 2001). However, the absence of optical emission\nsuggests that free-free absorption is also a plausible mechanism to explain the absence of\ncentimeter wave emission from the core.\nWe find that the core spectrum is flat in the 3 mm window (86\u2013114 GHz) (Figure 8 and\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nTable 2). Using the error limits on the peak fluxes at 86 GHz and 112.4 GHz, the range for\nthe spectral index could however be -0.1 to -0.9. But after including the emission at 110 GHz,\nFigure 8 shows the core spectrum to be nearly flat. Steeply positive spectral indices, such\nas produced by dust emission (e.g. Wolfire & Churchwell 1994), are excluded. Optically\nthin free-free emission, such as might be produced by H II regions in a starburst, could\nproduce a flat spectrum. However, the upper limit of 0.8 mJy on the 20 cm core flux rules\nout this possibility. The continuum flux from nuclei of starburst galaxies becomes higher\nwith increasing wavelength at wavelengths greater than 2 cm (due to non-thermal emission),\nbut shortward of 2 cm free-emission is optically thin (e.g. Turner and Ho (1983)). This\nmeans that the free-contribution at 3 mm must be well below 0.8 mJy, which is much less\nthan the observed 15 mJy. We therefore conclude that the 3 mm continuum emission cannot\nbe attributed to a starburst. Since flat millimeter-wave spectrum cores are often produced\nby non-thermal emission in other types of AGN than those in FR I galaxies, we conclude\nthat the core emission is likely produced by an AGN. The flatness of the spectrum implies\nthat we are seeing a compact source which is optically thick at 3mm. However the source\nmay have a range of size scales, like a jet with some opening angle so that different parts of\nthe structure become optically thin at different wavelengths (e.g., Blandford & Konigl 1979;\nMarscher 1980; Ghisellini & Maraschi 1989).\nThe bright, compact core and twin jet structure of NGC 3801 lend support to the idea\nthat FR I sources are the parent population of BL Lac objects (Trussoni et al. 2003; Urry &\nPadovani 1995). According to this hypothesis, BL Lac radio sources are FR I nuclei in which\nthe line of sight coincides with the axis of the radio jets; the resultant relativistic beaming\neffect produces very luminous radio cores. In NGC 3801, the twin jet structure indicates\na large beaming angle. But it was puzzling that the radio core was not visible; our BIMA\nresults confirm that there is a bright radio core at the galaxy center. Our observation of the\nflat spectrum core in NGC 3801 is thus consistent with the unification scheme for AGNs in\nradio loud galaxies.\n\n4.2.\n\nThe Central Molecular Gas Disk\n\nAs described in Section 3.2, CO clumps A and B appear associated with the dust\nfilament at a PA of 24\u25e6 that is offset about 1\u2032\u2032 west of the nucleus. This filament resembles a\ndisk seen nearly edge on (see Verdoes Kleijn et al 1999); if we take the distance of the peaks\nof clumps A and B from the nucleus (\u223c 10\u2032\u2032 ) as the radius of the disk, then the fact that the\nfilament is offset \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 west of the nucleus suggests a disk with a 10/1 axis ratio, implying a\ndisk with an inclination of 84\u25e6 with the near side facing east. The position-velocity cut at\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nP A = 24\u25e6 (Figure 9) is also consistent with a disk seen close to edge on. Both clumps A and\nB are offset from the nucleus by about 250 km s\u22121 , assuming a systemic velocity of of 3451\nkm s\u22121 . The velocity gradient for the 2 kpc CO disk is in the same direction as the gradient\nseen in H\u03b1 and [NII] on scales of a few hundred pc in STIS HST data by Verdoes Kleijn\net al. (1999). If we interpret the velocity gradient as rotation, then with a nearly edge-on\ninclination of 84\u25e6 the circular velocity is vc = 250 km s\u22121 at a radius of 2.3 kpc (10\u2032\u2032 ), which\ngives a rough estimate of the dynamical mass Mdyn = vc2 r/G \u2248 3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . The combined\nmolecular mass of CO clumps A and B is about 3 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 , about 1% of the dynamical\nmass within this radius. The HI seen in emission is at similar velocities to CO clumps A\nand B; if we attribute the HI emission to the same regions, then the mass in neutral atomic\ngas is 1.2 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 , about four times the molecular mass, and the total gas mass is about\n5% of the dynamical mass.\nThe total molecular gas mass in NGC 3801 is lower than in most spiral galaxies but large\ncompared to gas poor ellipticals. The molecular gas surface density in NGC 3801 averaged\nover the R25 radius is about 0.2 M\u2299 pc\u22122 , similarly small compared to most spirals (e.g.\nSheth et al. 2002). For the molecular gas disk itself (e.g. clumps A and B), adopting a\nradius of 2.3 kpc the average face-on surface density is 18.4 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ; this is large compared\nto the molecular surface density in the solar neighborhood but somewhat smaller than the\naverage for the Milky Way at a radius of 5 kpc (i.e. including the 5 kpc ring).\nWe can place constraints on the star formation rate in NGC 3801 using the infrared\nluminosity of 2.4 \u00d7 109 L\u2299 derived from the IRAS 60 and 100 \u03bcm fluxes (Knapp et al.\n1989) using the relations given by Cox (1999). Using the relation SF R = 4.5 \u00d7 10\u221244 LF IR\n(Kennicutt 1998) to derive the star formation rate (SFR), we obtain a SFR\u223c0.4 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nWe can also estimate the star formation rate using the H\u03b1 + [NII] luminosity observed with\nHST by Verdoes Kleijn et al. (1999). Using the star formation relation for H\u03b1 in Kennicutt\n(1998)) and assuming all the luminosity is from H\u03b1, we find a star formation rate of 0.2 M\u2299\nyr\u22121 , a factor of two lower than the infrared estimate. It is possible that the optical estimate\nis affected by dust extinction in the edge-on disk. This is a fairly low SFR compared to the\ndisks of nearby spiral galaxies, which have a SFR of a few M\u2299 yr\u22121 , but larger than gas poor\nellipticals.\nBy contrast, the other FR I mapped at high resolution, 3C 31, has a more massive 109\nM\u2299 disk with a radius of about 1 kpc (Okuda et al. 2005). This yields a surface density\nof 300M\u2299 pc\u22122 , larger even than the median for the central 500 pc radius of nearby spiral\ngalaxies (Sakamoto et al. 1999; Sheth et al 2002). Yet Okuda et al. (2005) note the absence\nof detected star formation in 3C 31, very different from NGC 3801.\nAssuming a present rate of SF R \u223c0.4 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , the molecular gas will last for \u223c 109 yr\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nbefore being exhausted by star formation. Including the HI reservoir, the gas can last for\nwell over 109 yr.\n\n4.3.\n\nClump C: Infalling Molecular Gas\n\nThe nature of the eastern CO clump, clump C, is particularly intriguing. It does not\nappear to be associated with the central gas disk. If it were in that disk, because it is\nnear the minor axis its deprojected distance from the nucleus would be 20 kpc, an order of\nmagnitude further than clumps A and B. Also, it has emission in the range 3470 to 3630\nkm s\u22121 , significantly redshifted relative to the 3451 km s\u22121 systemic velocity; given that it\nwould be on the disk minor axis, this velocity is highly non-circular. Assuming the disk\norientation described in Section 3.2, it would be outflowing at an improbably large velocity.\nWe conclude that it is not in the central gas disk.\nAnother possibility is that clump C is part of a second disk oriented perpendicular to\nthe central disk. NGC 3801 is sometimes classified as an S0 galaxy, and the east filament\npartly associated with clump C might be the the dusty S0 disk seen edge on. However, the\nodds of encountering the specific geometry and orientations require are small, roughly one in\na thousand. In detail, the \"SO disk\" would have to be edge-on to the line of sight to within\nless than 10\u25e6 to explain the thinness of the filament, 2) the nuclear edge-on disk would have\nto be within 10\u25e6 of edge-on and 3) the two disks would have to be perpendicular to each\nother to within 10\u25e6 . More importantly, closer examination suggests that NGC 3801 is not\nan S0 galaxy: the isophotes beyond a radius of 30\u2032\u2032 are boxy (e.g. Heckman et al. 1999),\nconsistent with a recent merger, and the inner isophotes show no evidence for a stellar disk\nthat would be associated with an S0. Finally, we note that the gas in the two disks are on\ncolliding orbits. If the eastern filament is an S0 disk it must have existed for some time.\nYet the P A = 24\u25e6 disk seems well established. Two disks with intersecting orbits cannot\nsurvive.\nA third unlikely scenario is that the clump C gas was entrained from the central gas\ndisk by the eastern AGN jet. This seems unreasonable first because the mass of clump C is\ncomparable to the mass of disk itself; it is difficult to understand how such a large fraction\nof the disk could pass in the path of the jet. Also, at the end of Section 3.2 we presented\nstrong evidence that the clump C is on the near side of the galaxy; in that case, if clump C\nis entrained from the central disk it should be blueshifted, contrary to our observations.\nThe most likely scenario is that clump C is gas resulting from a recent merger. Other\nevidence for a recent merger exists, such as the boxy stellar isophotes at radii larger than 30\u2032\u2032\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n(Heckman et al. 1996) and the warp in the P A = 24\u25e6 dust disk evident in the HST V-band\nimage of Verdoes Kleijn et al. (1999). As previously noted, clump C is associated with the\neastern dust filament; the shape of this filament is consistent with the orbital path of tidally\ndisrupted material. Molecular emission is only detected associated with the inner part of the\nfilament. This may be because that is where the largest gas mass exists, or perhaps because\nthe gas undergoes a transition to molecular form in the higher ISM pressure inner galaxy.\nSince clump C must be on the near side of the galaxy and it is redshifted relative to\nthe galaxy, we conclude that it is falling towards the galaxy. Its projected distance from the\nnucleus is only two or three kpc, and so it should soon interact with the 2 kpc nuclear disk.\n\n4.4.\n\nThe Role of Mergers in FR I and FR II Activity\n\nThere is considerable evidence that mergers fuel FR II radio sources, which are more\nenergetic than FR I objects such as NGC 3801. Baum, Heckman, and van Breugel (1992)\nstudied a sample of 40 radio galaxies. Using optical emission line studies, they concluded\nthat all the FR II galaxies showed evidence for dynamically young gas disks acquired via\nmergers, and suggested that this plays a key role in the FR II phenomenon. There is also\nevidence for gas disks with abundant molecular gas in FR II sources. In particular, Evans et\nal. (1999) found that the FR II galaxy 3C 293 has an asymmetric gas disk with a molecular\nhydrogen mass of 1.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . The gas is distributed over a 2.8 kpc radius region, and\nmay constitute as much as 10% of the dynamical mass of the galaxy within that radius.\nFor the less energetic FR I galaxies, the suggestion has been that the AGN may be\nfueled by gas acquired from the intracluster medium via a cooling flow (e.g. Baum et al.\n1992), motivated in part by the tendency for FR I galaxies to be found in clusters. However,\nour observations together with the recent Okuda et al. (2005) Nobeyama map of the FR I\ngalaxy 3C 31 suggests that mergers in addition to cooling flow gas, is important for powering\nthe AGN. The gas disk in NGC 3801 is three times less massive and has a surface density\nnearly a factor of 20 times lower. But it is nonetheless a signficant amount of gas. Perhaps\nmore significantly, in NGC 3801 there is abundant evidence that gas has recently arrived\nvia a merger (e.g. clump C) and that the gravitational effects of the merger are significant\n(e.g. the warp in the dust disk, the asymmetric distribution of gas in the disk, and the boxy\noptical isophotes). Hence, it appears that mergers and the resultant gas inflow (especially\ngas in non-coplanar orbits) may also play a key role in the FR I phenomenon. Based on\nthe limited high resolution studies so far, the gas masses (and the gas fraction relative to\nthe dynamical mass) seem somewhat lower in FR I galaxies compared to FR II galaxies.\nHowever, observations of a larger sample of galaxies and at higher angular resolution will be\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nessential to understanding gas fueling in radio galaxies; such observations are expected soon\nwith the CARMA millimeter-wave array.\n\n4.5.\n\nJet Entrainment of Molecular Gas?\n\nFigure 7 shows that the projected eastern radio jet passes almost directly through clump\nC. This raises the question of whether the jet is in fact interacting with the molecular cloud\nor instead simply appears projected behind the CO cloud. Powerful supersonic jets, such as\nthose found in FR II galaxies, overtake ambient clouds and inflate an overpressured cocoon\nin which the gas expands mostly perpendicular to the jet axis, driving a bow shock into the\nambient gas (e.g. O'Dea et al. 2002; 2004). However, such expansion is not seen in clump\nC. The HI gas, which is seen in absorption and as previously discussed must be on the near\nside of the jet, has nearly the same velocity range as the CO gas. The similarity in velocity\nrange argues against expansion such as produced by highly supersonic FR II jets (e.g. O'Dea\net al. 2002, 2004). Thus the jet is not affecting the gross kinematics of the cloud.\nA more likely possibility is jet entrainment (e.g. De Young 1986; Bicknell 1986). Note\nthat earlier we ruled out the possibility that clump C is gas entrained from the nuclear disk;\nhere we examine the possibility that the jet is entraining gas from clump C. Jet entrainment\nis thought to occur in transonic jets, such as those found in FR I galaxies. Here gas in the\nturbulent boundary layer along the edge of the jet is entrained and accelerated mainly along\nthe direction of the jet flow. In this case, the kinematics of gas on the near side (e.g. HI in\nabsorption) and the far side should not show a systematic difference. Thus, the velocities\nassociated with clump C are consistent with entrainment. In fact, the position-velocity\ndiagram for clump C shown in the lower panel of Figure 9 shows possible evidence supporting\nthe entrainment picture. Note that the velocity of clump C becomes less redshifted with\nincreasing distance from the nucleus. This is in the opposite sense of the gradient expected\nfor a rising rotation curve. In principle, it could be explained as a declining rotation curve.\nHowever, the velocity decreases from about 3600 km s\u22121 at 7\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus to about\n3540 km s\u22121 beyond 10\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus, much too large a decrease to be attributed to a\ndeclining rotation curve. However, the decreasing redshift with distance from the nucleus is\nin the correct direction expected for jet entrainment if the eastern jet is the approaching jet,\nas supported by our observations.\nFigure 4 also shows that the eastern jet appears to bend just after appearing to pass\nthrough clump C, suggesting a possible association. We note, however that the opposite jet\nalso bends at the same distance from the nucleus, but there is no detected molecular gas\nconcentration. Such bends can occur due to interaction with the rotating ISM of a galaxy or\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\ndue to precession of the jet; we favor the latter interpretation since the one clear gas rotation\naxis in NGC 3801 (the P A = 24\u25e6 disk) has the wrong orientation to attribute the jet bend\nto rotation of the ISM. The jet axis close to the nuclear disk is offset from normal to the\ndisk by about 6\u25e6 ; the offset is not suprising as the radio jets in nearby radio galaxies are not\nalways normal to the large scale gas disk (e.g. Wilson, Yang & Cecil 2001; Verdoes Kleijn &\nde Zeeuw 2004). The inflow from the disk that presumably feeds the black hole can produce\ntorques leading to jet precession.\nAlso we note the remarkable alignment of the eastern jet with the eastern dust filament,\nevident in Figure 6. The initial bend in the jet coincides almost exactly with a bend in the\ndust filament. Further from the galaxy the jet bends further to the north while the filament\ncontinues nearly in a straight line for more than 20\u2032\u2032 (4.6 kpc). This might suggest ballistic\nmotion of the denser gas while the more diffuse radio gas bends to the north. However, given\nthat the dense gas was entrained by the jet, it is difficult to understand how it can separate\nfrom the jet. Also, it is not obvious how the entrained gas could remain so collimated.\nThus we prefer our earlier conclusion that the filament traces the orbital path of the tidally\ndisrupted merging gas of clump C.\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have mapped and detected 3 mm continuum and CO (1\u20130) emission from the Fanaroff & Riley type I galaxy NGC 3801 using the BIMA array. We draw the following\nconclusions:\n1. We detect 3 mm continuum emission from twin radio jets of similar brightness and\nextent and an unresolved nuclear core. Comparing to a VLA 20 cm map, we find that the 3\nmm and 20 cm jets coincide, and derive a spectral index of \u22120.7, consistent with synchrotron\nemission. The core has not previously been detected in the radio; we derive a 3 mm flux of\n15 mJy, substantially brighter than the 20 cm upper limit of 0.8 mJy. The millimeter-wave\nspectrum is flat, as generally observed for the compact radio core of an AGN; other emission\nmechanisms appear unlikely. Our detection of the bright compact core, along with the twin\njet structure, supports the idea that FR I galaxies are the parent population of BL Lac\nobjects.\n2. We mapped CO (1\u20130) emission in a region of roughly 100\u2032\u2032 (23 kpc) diameter and\ndetect CO concentrated in three regions, each with molecular masses in excess of 108 M\u2299\nassuming the standard conversion factor for CO. Unresolved HI emission is seen over a\nsimilar velocity range. We are able to associate each of the CO clumps with an HI emission\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nor absorption component. The molecular mass is approximately 25% of the HI mass.\n3. Two of the CO clumps are associated with a nearly edge-on dust disk imaged in\nprevious HST V-band observations; the disk is oriented approximately perpendicular to the\ntwin radio jets. The CO and dust distributions suggest an inhomogeneous disk (i.e. not\naxisymmetric) or ring with a radius of about 2.3 kpc. The velocity shift between the two\nregions and across one of the clumps is consistent with rotation reaching a maximum of 250\nkm s\u22121 . We infer an inclination of 84\u25e6 from the offset of the dust major axis from the nucleus\nrelative to the radius of the disk or ring. The implied dynamical mass is about 3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 ;\nthus the molecular mass is approximately 1% of the dynamical mass.\n4. We find evidence that the other CO region, clump C, is infalling gas from a recent\nmerger. Perhaps most intriguing, there are suggestions that one of the radio jets is entraining\nmaterial from the clump.\n5. There are abundant signs that NGC 3801 has undergone a recent minor merger.\nThese include the infalling gas, boxy optical isophotes, the structure of the dust filaments,\nand the inhomogeneous distribution of gas. We therefore suggest that, as in F-R II galaxies,\nmergers play a role in the F-R I phenomenonon.\nWe thank S.

The three peaks in CO (1\u20130) emission are marked as A, B, and C.\nFigure 4. Contours of BIMA 2.7 mm continuum emission overlaid on a greyscale image of VLA 20 cm emission. The continuum\nemission is contoured as in Figure 1a.\nFigure 5. BIMA spectrum of CO (1\u20130) emission in NGC 3801 summed over a 30 \u00d7 40\u2032\u2032 box.\nFigure 6. VLA 20 cm radio continuum (upper panel) and BIMA velocity-integrated CO (1\u20130) emission (lower panel) overlaid\non HST F555W image of NGC 3801. The 20 cm and CO (1\u20130) images are contoured as in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The\nHST image has been processed to remove the radial gradient in light from the host galaxy so as to better reveal dust features.\nThe galaxy nucleus is marked with an X.\nFigure 7. Contours of BIMA CO (1\u20130) velocity-integrated emission overlaid on a greyscale image of VLA 20 cm emission. CO\nemission is contoured as in Figure 3.\nFigure 8. Flux of the radio continuum core in NGC 3801 as a function of frequency at millimeter-wavelengths on a log-log plot.\nOne \u03c3 error bars are shown. The dotted line shows a \u03bd 3.5 power law characteristic of dust emission, which is ruled out. The\nmillimeter-wave spectrum can be fitted by a flat spectrum.\nFigure 9. Position-velocity (PV) plots of CO (1\u20130) emission for two cuts passing through the nucleus of NGC 3801. The upper\npanel shows the cut at PA = 24\u25e6 corresponding to the major axis of the nuclear disk; the lower panel shows the perpendicular\ndirection (PA=114\u25e6 ). The systemic velocity is indicated by the dotted line. Contours are at 14, 21, and 28 mJy beam\u22121 . The\nPA=24\u25e6 cut passes through CO clumps A and B, which are labeled. The PA=114\u25e6 cut passes through clump C.\n\n\f\fThis figure \"HST_overlay_BW.gif\" is available in \"gif\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/astro-ph/0505285v1\n\n\fThis figure \"cm_maps.gif\" is available in \"gif\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/astro-ph/0505285v1\n\n\f\f\fThis figure \"mm_on_vla.gif\" is available in \"gif\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/astro-ph/0505285v1\n\n\f\f\f\f"}
