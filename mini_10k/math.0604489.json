In Section 6 we apply the results\nof Sections 1 and 2 to the study of sets of matrices in Mn\u00d7n (Z) whose\ncharacteristic polynomials are reducible, and again, to get estimates\non the growth of these sets as a function of height (the size of coeffcients).

Let P1 (d, B) be the set of polynomials of degree d with integer\ncoefficients bounded in absolute value by N and constant coefficient 1,\nand let R1 (d, B) be the set of polynomials reducible over Z with the same\ncoefficient bound. Then, R1 lies on an algebraic hypersurface Cd\u22121 (where\nthe coordinates are the coefficients), and consequently\n\u0012 \u0013\nR1 (B)\n1\n.\n=O\nP1 (B)\nB\nProof. A factor of a polynomial in R1 (d, B) must have constant term \u00b11,\nThe statement now follows immediately from the results in Sections\n1 and 2.\n\u0003\n4.1. Arbitrary polynomials. What happens if we don't require the\nconstant coefficient to be 1? Consider the set F(d, a) of all monic\npolynomials of degree d and with constant term a. Clearly, the constant term of a divisor of such a polynomial must have constant term\nd dividing a, and so for each c|a we have a subvariety of F(d, a) of\npolynomials having a factor with constant term c. The arguments\nabove apply without change, and we see that the number of such\npolynomials modulo p grows at most as O(pd\u22122 ), where the constant\nis uniform. Denoting the number of divisors of a by \u03c4(a), it is not\nhard to see that \u03c4(a) = o(a). Indeed, since the number of divisors is a\nmultiplicative function,\n\u03c4(n = p\u03b11 1 . . . p\u03b1k k ) = (\u03b11 + 1) . . . (\u03b1k + 1) < 2 log2 n,\nwhereupin the assertion follows easily.\nSo, it follows that for any a, the set of reducible polynomials is a\nunion of o(a) subvarieties of F(d, a). To show that most polynomials\nwith coefficients bounded by B in absolute value are irreducible,\nwe use Bertand's postulate to find a prime p, such that 2B < p <\n\n\fPOLYNOMIALS, MATRICES, AND AUTOMORPHISMS\n\n5\n\n4B. Since the set of reducible polynomials lies on the union of o(B2 )\ncodimension two subvarieties, their total number is o(pd ), while the\ntotal number of monic polynomials is Bd \u2265 2\u2212d pd , and we have our\nresult.\n5.

Reciprocal polynomials can also\nbe defined as follows: A (monic) polynomial (of even degree 2n) is\nreciprocal if it can be written as\nn\nY\nY\n(x \u2212 ri )(x \u2212 1/ri ) =\nj = 1n (x2 \u2212 (ri + r\u22121\ni )x + 1).\nj=1\n\nNotice that this means that every recriprocal polynomial lies on our\n\"factorization variety\"3, and so the methods do not work directly.\nHowever, we can get around this with a trick.\nNote that any reciprocal polynomial in x of even degree 2n can\nbe written (uniquely) as a multiple (by xn ) of a polynomial g(y) in\ny = x + 1/x of degree n. The proof is very simple: Dividing through\nby xn , we write\nn\u22121\nX\nai (xi\u2212n + xn\u2212i ).\nf (x) = an +\ni=0\n\nn\n\nNote that (x+1/x) is a reciprocal polynomial, and so is f (x)\u2212(x+1/x)n ,\nwhich is also of lower degree than f (x). The result now follows by\ninduction (notice that the coefficients of g are integer linear combinations (whose coefficients depend only on the degree of f ) of the\ncoefficients of f, and, obviously, vice versa.\nNow, it is clear that in order for f (x) to be reducible, g(y) must\nbe also. Indeed, suppose f (x) = f1 (x) . . . fk (x), where the fi are irreQ\nducible. Since x2 n f (1/x) = f (x), it follows that f (x) = ki=1 xdeg fi (x) fi (1/x).\nBy the irreducibility of fi (x), it follows that either fi is a reciprocal polynomial, or fi is the reciprocal of some f j , in which case fi (x) f j (x) is a\nreciprocal polynomial. So, f (x) has a reciprocal factorization, and so\ng(y) is reducible.\nWe now reason as in Section 4.1, but with polynomials g(y) replacing f (x).\n3\n\nthe author thanks N.

The number of matrices in SL(n, p) whose characteristic poly2\nnomial has a factor over Fp , with constant term 1, grows as o(pn \u22121 ).\n\nProof. The proof requires one additional observation: that every\nmonic polynomial p(x) of degree d with constant term 1 is the characteristic polynomial of some matrix in SL(d) \u2013 namely the companion\nmatrix of p(x). It follows that the set of matrices whose characteristic\npolynomial satisfies the assumptions of the Lemma lies on an algebraic subvariety of SL(n), and the result follows by Lang-Weil.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7. The probability that a matrix in SL(n, p) satisfies the hypotheses of Lemma 6 goes to 0 as p goes to infinity.\nProof. The order of SL(n, p) is well known to be\n2\n\n2\n\np(n \u2212n)/2 (p2 \u2212 1)(p3 \u2212 1) . . . (pn \u2212 1) \u223c pn \u22121 ,\n\n(see Newman's book [13][VII.17]). The assertion of the corollary\nfollows immediately.\n\u0003\nUnfortunately, since the number of integral points on SL(n, Z) of\n2\nheight (absolute value) bounded by B grows much slower than Bn \u22121\nthe above results do not imply the following\nConjecture 8. The probability that a matrix in SL(n, Z) with coefficients\nbounded by B has reducible characteristic polynomial goes to 0 as B goes to\ninfinity.4\nBut since we know that the number of points on Mm\u00d7n (Z) of height\n2\nbounded by B grows like Bn , we do have\nTheorem 9. The probability that a matrix in Mn\u00d7n (Z) with coefficients\nbounded by B has reducible characteristic polynomial goes to 0 as B goes to\ninfinity.\nProof. The probability that such a matrix factors modulo a large prime\nB < p < 2B (factors having constant terms equal to the divisors of the\nconstant term of the characteristic polynomial mod p) already goes\nto 0,\n\u0003\n4\n\nIt has been suggested by Peter Sarnak that the methods of [5] can be extended\nto prove this conjecture.This is the subject of a forthcoming paper by the author.\n\n\fPOLYNOMIALS, MATRICES, AND AUTOMORPHISMS\n\n7\n\n6.2. Lower bounds and asymptotics. Theorem 9 gives an estimate\n2\nof O(Bn \u22121 log B) on the number of matrices in Mn\u00d7n (Z) with reducible\ncharacteristic polynomial. To get a lower bound, we recall the following theorem of Yonatan Katznelson:\nTheorem 10 (Y. Katznelson, [8]). The number of n \u00d7 n singular integral\n2\nmatrices with entries bounded by B is asymptotic to cn Bn \u2212n log B.\nThe following Corollary is quite easy:\nCorollary 11. The number of n\u00d7n matrices whose characteristic polynomial\n2\nhas a linear factor over Z is bounded below by c\u2032n Bn \u2212n+1 log B.\nProof. For every singular matrix M, the matrices M+kIn , k \u2208 Z have\ncharacteristic polynomial which has a linear factor over Z.\n\u0003\nSo, it follows that if Nn,B is the number of reducible integer matrices\nwith coefficients bounded by B, we have, for some non-zero constants\nc1 , c2 :\n(5)\n\n2\n\n2\n\nc1 Bn \u2212n+1 log B \u2264 N(n, B) \u2264 c2 Bn \u22121 log B.\n\nNote that for n = 2, the upper and lower bounds grow at the same\nrate, so we now the order of growth (which can be sharpened to an\nasymptotic result without too much difficulty). Otherwise, there is\na considerable gap between the upper and the lower bounds, We\nconjecture that the lower bound is the truth:\nConjecture 12.\n2\n\nN(n, B) \u224d cn Bn \u2212n+1 log B.\n7.

However, it is sometimes more natural to measure size\ndifferently: In particular, if we have a generating set \u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3l of our\nlattice \u0393 (which might be SL(n, Z) or Sp(2n, Z)) we might want to\nmeasure the size of an element by the length of the (shortest) word\nin \u03b3i equal to that element \u2013 this is the combinatorial measure of size.\nThe relationship between the size of elements and combinatorial\nlength is not at all clear, so the results in this section are proved quite\ndifferently from the results in the preceding section. We will need\nthe following results: First a result of this author\n\n\f8\n\nIGOR RIVIN\n\nTheorem 13 (Rivin [14]). Let G be a graph whose vertices are labeled\nby generators of a finite group \u0393. Consider the set of SN elements of \u0393\nobtained by multiplying elements along walks of length n. Then, SN becomes\nequidistributed over \u0393 as N goes to infinity.\nWe will also need the following results of Nick Chavdarov and\nArmand Borel.\nTheorem 14 (Chavdarov, A. Borel [3]). Let q > 4, and let Rq (n) be the set\nof 2n\u00d72n symplectic matrices over the field Fq with reducible characteristic\npolynomials. Then\n|Rq (n)|\n1\n<1\u2212 .\n| Sp(2n, Fp )|\n3n\nTheorem 15 (Chavdarov, A. Borel [3]).

Then\n|Gq (n)|\n1\n<1\u2212 .\n| SL(n, Fq )|\n2n\nTheorem 15 follows easily from the following result of A. Borel:\n\nTheorem 16 (A. Borel). Let F be a monic polynomial of degree N over\nZ/pZ with nonzero constant term. Then, the number #F, p of matrices in\nGL(N, p) with characteristic polynomial equal to F satisfies\n(p \u2212 3)N\n\n2 \u2212N\n\n\u2264 #(F, p) \u2264 (p + 3)N\n\n2 \u2212N\n\n.\n\nTheorem 16 will be used in Section 8. A result we will need in\nSection 9, and might as well state here, is:\nTheorem 17 (D. Kirby, [9]). Any reciprocal polynomial is the characteristic polynomial of a symplectic matrix.\nWe now have our results:\nTheorem 18. Let G and SN , be as in the statement of Theorem 13, but with\n\u0393 = Sp(2n, Z), or \u0393 = SL(2, Z). Then the probability that a matrix in SN\nhas a reducible characteristic polynomial goes to 0 as N tends to infinity.\nProof. Let \u0393l be the set of matrices in \u0393 reduced modulo l \u2013 it is known\n(see [13]) that Gammal is SL(n, l) or Sp(2n, l) (depending on which \u0393\nwe took. Let p1 , . . . , pk be distinct primes, let K = p1 . . . pk . We know\nthat:\n\u0393K = \u0393p1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 \u0393pk .\n(see [13] for the proof of the last equality). A generating set of\nSp(2n, Z) projects via reduction modulo K to a a generating set of\n\n\fPOLYNOMIALS, MATRICES, AND AUTOMORPHISMS\n\n9\n\n\u0393K (see, again, Newman's book [13]), and also, via reduction mod\npi to generating sets of the Sp(2n, pi ). By Theorems 13 and 14, the\nprobability that the characteristic polynomial in a random product\nof N \u226b 1 generators is reducible modulo all of the pi is at most equal\nto (1 \u2212 3/n)k . Since this is an upper bound on the probability of being\nreducible modulo Z, the result follows.\n\u0003\nRemark 19. Using Lemma 6 instead of Theorem 15 for SL() gives a\nsharper result, as well as a more elementary argument.\nAn example of a graph G is a bouquet of circles. In this case, we are\njust taking random products of generators or their inverses. Another\nis the graph (studied in [14]) where a generator is never followed by\nits inverse (so only reduced words in generators are allowed), and so\non.\n8.

The probability that a random word of length L in a generating set of SL(N, Z) has characteristic polynomial with Galois group SN\ngoes to 1 as L goes to infinity.\nAside from its intrinsic interest, Theorem 20 implies the following:\nTheorem 21. The probability that a random word w of length L in a generating set of SL(N, Z) and all proper powers wk have irreducible characteristic\npolynomials goes to 1 as L goes to infinity.\nTheorem 21 will follow easily from Theorem 20 together with the\nfollowing Lemma:\nLemma 22. Let M \u2208 SL(n, Z) be such that the characteristic polynomial\nof Mk is reducible for some k. Then the Galois group of the characteristic\npolynomial of M is imprimitive, or the characteristic polynomial of M is\ncyclotomic.\nRemark 23. For the definition of imprimitive see, for example, [16, 7].\nProof. Assume that the characteristic polynomial \u03c7(M) is irreducible\n(otherwise the conclusion of the Lemma obviously holds, since the\nGalois group of \u03c7(M) is not even transitive). Let the roots of \u03c7(M)\n(in the algebraic closure of Q) be \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n . The roots of \u03c7(Mk ) are\n\n\f10\n\nIGOR RIVIN\n\n\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2n , where \u03b2 j = \u03b1kj . Suppose that \u03c7(Mk ) is reducible, and so\nthere is a factor of \u03c7(Mk ) whose roots are \u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2l , for some l < n.\nSince Gal(\u03c7(M)) acts transitively on \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n , it must be true that for\nevery i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, \u03b1ki = \u03b2 j , for some j \u2208 {1, . . . , l}. Let B j be those i for\nwhich \u03b1ki = \u03b2 j . This defines a partition of {1, . . . , n} into blocks, which\nis stabilized by the Galois group of \u03c7(M), and so G is an intransitive\nsubgroup of Sn , unless l = 1. In that case, the characteristic polynomial\nof Mk equals (x\u2212\u03b2)n , and since Mk \u2208 SL(n, Z) it follows that \u03b2 = 1, and\nall the eigenvalues of M are n-th roots of unity, so that Mk = 1.\n\u0003\n9.

The group \u0393g admits a homomorphism s onto Sp(2g, Z)\n(we associate to each element its action on homology; the symplectic\nstructure comes from the intersection pairing). The following result\ncan be find in [2]:\nTheorem 24. For \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393g to be pseudo-Anosov, it is sufficient that g = \u03b3\nsatisfy all of the following conditions:\n(1) The characteristic polynomial of g is irreducible.\n(2) The characteristic polynomial of g is not cyclotomic.\n(3) The characteristic polynomial of g is not of the form g = h(xk ), for\nsome k > 1.\nThe following is a corollary of our results on matrix group:\nTheorem 25. Let g1 , . . . , gk be a generating set of Sp(2n, Z). The probability that a random product of length N of g1 , . . . , gk satisfies the conditions\nof Theorem 24 goes to 1 as N goes to infinity.\nProof. We prove that the probability that the random word wN not\nsatisfy the conditions goes to 0. By Theorem 18, the probability that\nwN has reducible characteristic polynomial goes to 0. In order for the\ncharacteristic polynomial to be of the form g = h(xk ) it is necessary\nthat the linear term (the trace) vanish. This is a proper subvariety\nof Sp(2g), and so the number of elements of any Sp(2g, p) satisfying\n2\nthis condition is of order of p2g +g\u22121 . Since the number of elements\n2\nin Sp(2g, p) is of order of p2g +g (Dickson's Theorem, see [13]), the\nproof of Theorem 18 goes through verbatim (but needs Theorem 17)\nto show that this is an asymptotically negligible condition. Finally,\nsince the set of cyclotomic polynomials of a given degree is finite,\nthe set of symplectic matrices with those characteristic polynomials\n\n\fPOLYNOMIALS, MATRICES, AND AUTOMORPHISMS\n\n11\n\nis also a subvariety of the full group (again, needing Theorem 17),\nand the same result holds.\n\u0003\n10.

By passing to the\naction of \u03c6 on homology, Section 86 shows the following:\nTheorem 26. Let f1 , . . . , fk be a generating set of the automorphism group\nof Fn .

It is a classical result\nof B. L. van der Waerden that the probability that the Galois group\nof p \u2208 PN,d (Z) is the full symmetric group Sd tends to 1 as N tends\nto infinity. The argument is quite elegant: First, it is observed that\na subgroup H < Sd is the full symmetric group if and only if H\nintersects every conjugacy class of Sd . This means that H has an\nelement with every possible cycle type. It is further noted that there\nis a cycle type (n1 , . . . , nk ) in the Galois group of p over Z/pZ if and\nonly if p factors over Z/pZ into irreducible polynomials of degrees\nn1 , . . . , nk . Using Dedekind's generating function for the number of\nirreducible polynomials over Z/pZ of a given degree, it is shown\nthat the probability of a fixed partition is is bounded below by a\nconstant (independent of the prime p), and the proof is finished by\nan application of a Chinese Remainder Theorem.\nIn this note, we ask the following simple-sounding question: Let\nPN,d,a,k (Z) be the set of all polynomials in PN,d(Z) where the coefficient\nof xk equals a. Is it still true that the Galois group of a random such\npolynomial is the full symmetric group? The result would obviously\n5\n\nThis terminology, with strong support from this author, has been introduced\nby L. Mosher and M. Handel for what was previously known as irreducible with\nirreducible powers\n6\nWe need to change SL(n, Z) to GL(n, Z) throughout\n\n\f12\n\nIGOR RIVIN\n\nfollow if the probability that the Galois group of a random general\npolynomial is \"generic\" were to go to 1 sufficiently fast with N. In\nfact, the probability that an element of PN,d is reducible (which means\nthat its Galois group is not transitive, hence not Sn ) is of the order of\n1/N, so that approach does not work.\nMimicking the proof of van der Waerden's result does not appear\nto work (at least not easily): Dedekind's argument enumerates all\nirreducible polynomials, and the result is not \"graded\" by specific\ncoefficients. It is certainly possible that the argument can be pushed\nthrough, but this appears to be somewhat involved.\nGiven this sad state of affairs, we first use a simple trick and Dirichlet's theorem on primes on arithmetic progressions to show first the\nfollowing technical result:\nTheorem 27. The probability that a random element of PN,d,a,k (Z/pZ)\nhas a a prescribed splitting type s approachs the probability that a random\nunrestricted polynomial of degree d has the splitting type s, as long as p \u2212 1\nis relatively prime to (d \u2212 k)!, and as p becomes large. relatively prime to\nd \u2212 k.\nwhich implies (by van der Waerden's sieve argument):\nTheorem 28. The probability that a random element of PN,d,a,k (Z) has Sd\nas the Galois group tends to 1 as N tends to infinity,\nIt should be noted that the (multivariate) Large Sieve (as used by\nP. X. Gallagher in [6]) can be used to give an effective estimate on the\nprobability in the statement of Theorems 28: that is: p(N) \u226a N \u22121/2 .\nA.1. Proof of Theorem 28. We will need two ingredients other than\nvan der Waerden's original idea. The first of these is A. Weil's estimate on the number of Fp points on a curve defined over Fp :\nTheorem 29 (A. Weil,[15]). Let f \u2208 Fp [X, y] be an absolutely irreducible\n(that is, irreducible in Fp [X, Y]) polynomial of degree d. Then if\nC = {(x, y) \u2208 F2p | f (x, y) = 0},\nwe have the estimate\n\n\u221a\n||C| \u2212 p| \u2264 2g p + d2 ,\n\nwhere g is the genus of the curve defined f (which satisfies g \u2264 (d\u22121)(d\u22122).\nThis estimate is optimal.\nThe other classical result we shall need is the following:\n\n\fPOLYNOMIALS, MATRICES, AND AUTOMORPHISMS\n\n13\n\nTheorem 30 ([10][Theorem VIII.9.1). ] Let k be a field, and n \u2265 2 an\ninteger. Let a \u2208 k, a , 0. Assume that for all prime numbers p such that\np|n we have a < kp , and if 4|n, then a < \u22124k4 . Then Xn \u2212 a is irreducible in\nk[X].\nTheorem 30 goes essentially back to N. H. Abel's foundational\nmemoir.\nWe will need an additional observation:\nLemma 31. Let q = pl , and let x1 , . . . , xk \u2208 Fq . Let a, b \u2208 Fp , with (a, b) ,\n(1, 0). and let g(a, b)(x) = ax + b be a transformation of Fq to itself. Then,\nit is not possible for g(a, b) to permute x1 , . . . , xk , if k! is coprime to p \u2212 1.\n\nLemma 32. Consider a polynomial f of degree d over Fp , such that d < p,\nand such that the coefficient of xd\u22121 does not vanish. Then there is no pair\n(a, b) , (1, 0), such that f (ax + b) = ad f (x), for all x \u2208 Fp .\n\nProof. There are two distinct cases to analyze. The first is when a = 1.\nIn that case, f (x+b) = f (x) for all x \u2208 Fp , and since p > d, f (x+b) = f (x),\nfor all x in the algebraic closure of Fp . Let r be a root of f. Then, so are\nr + a, r + 2a, . . . , r + a(p \u2212 1), but since p is greater than d that means\nthat f is identically 0.\nThe second case is when a , 1. In that case, x0 = b/(1 \u2212 a) is\nfixed under the substitution x \u2192 ax + b, and changing of variables\nto z = x \u2212 x0 , sends f (z) to f (az). By the same argument as above,\nf (az) = ad f (z), and so the corresponding coefficients of the right\nand the left hand polynomials must be equal Since the coefficient\nof xd\u22121 does not vanish, it follows tha a = 1, which contradicts our\nassumption.\n\u0003\nThe argument now proceeds as follows. First, we note that if the\npolynomial f (x) of degree d has a certain splitting type (hence Galois\ngroup) over Fp then so does f (ax + b)/ad , for any a , 0, b \u2208 Fp . The set\nof all linear substitutions forms a group A, which acts freely on the\nset of polynomials of degree d, except for the (small) exceptional set\nof polynomials with a vanishing coefficient of xd\u22121 as long as d < p\n(by Lemma 32), so the distribution of splitting types among the A\norbits is the same as among all of the polynomials of degree d. Now,\nconsider polynomials with constant term 1. How many of them are\nthere in the A orbit of f (x)? It is easy to see that the number is equal\nto the number of solutions to\nf (b) = ad .\nIf the curve C f given by f (x)\u2212yd is absolutely irreducible, that number\n\u221a\nis p + O( p), by Theorem 29. By Theorem 30, in order for C f to not be\n\n\f14\n\nIGOR RIVIN\n\nabsolutely irreducible, we must either have that f (x) = gq (x), for some\nq|d, or f (x) = \u22124h4 (x), in case 4|d. But the number of such polynomials\nis bounded by O(pd/2 ), which is asymptotically neglible. So, we see\nthat the distribution of splitting types amongst polynomials of degree\nd with constant term 1 is the same as for all polynomials, as long as\nd < p.\nR\uf765\uf766\uf765\uf772\uf765\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773\n[1] Mladen Bestvina and Michael Handel.
