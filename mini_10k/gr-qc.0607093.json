On the other hand, theories alternative to GR, such as Higher Order Theories\nof Gravity (HOTG) can explain the acceleration of the\nUniverse without requiring the existence of dark energy\n[6, 7, 8, 9]. The simplest model of HOTG are the socalled f (R) theories, where the Lagrangian depends on\nan arbitrary analytic function f of the scalar curvature\nR. As it is well known, f (R) theories can be studied both\nin the metric formalism [10, 11, 12, 13] and in the Palatini formalism [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. We remind\nthat, in the vacuum case, f (R) theories, in the Palatini\nformalism, are equivalent to GR with a (non dynamical)\ncosmological constant.\nSince GR is in sharp agreement with the experimental results obtained in the Solar System [22], every theory\nthat aims at agreeing with experimental results at cosmological scale, should reproduce GR at the Solar System\nscale.\nSo, the problem arises of testing the reliability of these\ntheories with Solar System experiments. The dynamical equivalence between f (R) and scalar-tensor theories\nof gravity (see for instance [23] and references therein)\nhas been used to set bounds on the analytic form of the\nfunctions f (R), thanks to post-Newtonian parameters of\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: matteo.ruggiero@polito.it\naddress: lorenzo.iorio@libero.it\n\nscalar-tensor gravity [24]. However, this approach was\nrecently criticized [25], since the dynamical equivalence\nhas been used beyond its range of validity. Actually, the\ndebate is still open, and the problem can be faced both in\nthe metric formalism and in the Palatini formalism (see\n[26, 27] and references therein).\nAlso the issue of the dynamics of f (R) theories in both\nformalisms in the presence of matter (i.e. inside the\nsources of the gravitational field) is under debate [28, 29].\nIn particular, a recent paper [30] states that f (R) theories where a 1/R term is added to the Einstein-Hilbert\naction do not match Solar System experiments: these\nconclusions have been subsequently generalized to other\nforms of f (R) [31]. Indeed, these analyses are carried\nout in the metric formalism and lead to the same results obtained by Chiba [28]. The difficulties arising in\nthe metric formalism with the Solar System experiments,\nwhich ultimately depend on the matching between the\nsolutions inside and outside the matter distribution (i.e.\nthe matching between the star interior and the vacuum\nexterior), are not present in the Palatini formalism, as\nit has been recently showed [32]: in the Palatini formalism of the f (R) theories, the space-time inside a star\ndoes not affect the space-time outside it, (i.e. the vacuum solution), contrary to what happens in the metric\nformalism, even though in this approach the mass of the\nstar and its density have a non standard relation.\nIn a previous paper [26], one of us studied the consistence of f (R) theories with observational data in the\nPalatini formalism. We aimed at understanding the corrections to GR arising from specific modifications of the\nHilbert-Einstein Lagrangian. We found an exact solution (corresponding to constant scalar curvature R) to\nthe field equations in vacuum and we showed that the\nmodifications to standard GR are directly related to the\n\n\f2\nsolutions of what we called the structural equation. The\nlatter is an algebraic scalar-valued equation, that controls the solutions of the field equations of the theory.\nThese modifications can be suitably interpreted as postNewtonian parameters related to the non linearity of the\ntheory.\nThe exact solution we found in [26] corresponds to the\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter metric, which has been studied\nin the past [33, 34, 35] and, also, more recently in connection with the problem of the cosmological constant\n[36, 37, 38]. The relevance of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter\nmetric on f (R) theories of gravity has also been discussed\nin [39]. Here, we explicitly work out the effects of f (R)\ntheories on the Keplerian orbital elements of the Solar\nSystem planets, and compare them with the latest results in planetary orbit determination from the EPM2004\nephemerides, in order to obtain the best estimate for the\nparameter k, which is a measure of the non linearity of\nthe theory. We compare this estimate to the values of the\ncosmological constant \u039b and suggest that it can be used\nto set bounds on the parameters of the f (R) functions\nrelevant in cosmology.\nThe paper is organized as follows: after briefly introducing the theoretical framework of f (R) gravity and the\nvacuum exact solution in Sec. II, we investigate the perturbations of the orbital elements in Sec. III, which are\ncompared to recent data in Sec. IV; then, we show how\nour approach may lead to constraints in cosmology in\nSec. V. Conclusions are outlined in Sec. VI.\nII.\n\nVACUUM EXACT SOLUTION OF f (R)\nGRAVITY FIELD EQUATIONS\n\nThe equations of motion of the f (R) gravity in the\nPalatini formalism can be obtained, by independent variations with respect to the metric and the connection,\nfrom the action [57]\nZ\n\u221a\nA = Agrav + Amat = [ gf (R) + 2\u03c7Lmat(\u03c8, \u2207\u03c8)] d4 x,\n\n(1)\nwhere R \u2261 R(g, \u0393) = g \u03b1\u03b2 R\u03b1\u03b2 (\u0393), R\u03bc\u03bd (\u0393) is the Riccilike tensor of any torsionless connection \u0393 independent\nfrom the metric g, which is assumed here to be the physical metric. The gravitational part of the Lagrangian\nis represented by any real analytic function f (R) of the\nscalar curvature R. The total Lagrangian contains also\na first order matter part Lmat functionally depending on\nyet unspecified matter fields \u03a8 together with their first\nderivatives, equipped with a gravitational coupling constant \u03c7 = 8\u03c0G\nc4 (see e.g. [40, 41]).\nAccording to the Palatini formalism [14, 15, 16, 17, 18,\n19, 20, 21, 42, 43, 44], from (1) we obtain the following\nequations of motion:\n1\nmat\n,\nf \u2032 (R)R(\u03bc\u03bd) (\u0393) \u2212 f (R)g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c7T\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\u221a\n\u2207\u0393\u03b1 [ gf \u2032 (R)g \u03bc\u03bd ) = 0,\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\nmat\nwhere Tmat\n= \u2212 \u221a2g \u03b4L\ndenotes the matter source\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd\n\nstress-energy tensor and \u2207\u0393 means covariant derivative\nwith respect to the connection \u0393. Actually, it is possible\nto show [43, 44] that the manifold M , which is the model\nof the space-time, can be a posteriori endowed with a\nbi-metric structure (M, g, h) equivalent to the original\nmetric-affine structure (M, g, \u0393), where \u0393 is assumed to\nbe the Levi-Civita connection of h. The two metrics are\nconformally related by\nh\u03bc\u03bd = f \u2032 (R) g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(4)\n\nThe equation of motion (2) can be supplemented by the\nscalar-valued equation obtained by taking the g-trace of\nmat\n(2), where we set \u03c4 = trT = g \u03bc\u03bd T\u03bc\u03bd\n:\nf \u2032 (R)R \u2212 2f (R) = \u03c7\u03c4.\n\n(5)\n\nThe algebraic equation (5) is called the structural\nequation and it controls the solutions of equation (2).\nThe field equations (2-3) and the structural equation\n(5) in vacuum become\n1\n[f \u2032 (R)]R(\u03bc\u03bd) (\u0393) \u2212 [f (R)]g\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n2\n\u221a\n\u2207\u0393\u03b1 ( g [f \u2032 (R)] g \u03bc\u03bd ) = 0,\nf \u2032 (R)R \u2212 2f (R) = 0,\n\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n\nAs shown in [26] (see, in particular, Section 3), the system\nof equations (6-8) has the spherical symmetrical solution\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndr2\n2m kr2\ndt2 +\n+\nds2 = \u2212 1 \u2212\n2\u0001\n2m\nr\n3\n1 \u2212 r + kr3\n+ r2 d\u03b82 + r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the source of the gravitational field\nand k = ci /4, where R = ci is any of the solutions of the\nstructural equation (8). In doing so, we have obtained a\nsolution with constant scalar curvature R.\nIn particular, if f (R) = R, i.e. our theory is GR,\nR = 0 is the solution of the structural equation, and (9)\nreduces to the classical Schwarzschild solution. Again,\nfor a thorough discussion we refer to [26], and references\ntherein.\nThe metric (9) corresponds to the Schwarzschild-de\nSitter space-time (see [45, 46]), which is exactly a solution\nof standard GR with fixed value cosmological constant.\nFrom (9) it is evident that the modifications to the\nstandard Schwarzschild solution of vacuum GR are proportional to the values of the Ricci scalar, owing to the\nproportionality between k and ci . Indeed, this contribution to the gravitational potential should be small enough\nnot to contradict the known tests of gravity. In the cases\nof small values of R (which surely occur at Solar System scale) the Einsteinian limit (i.e. the Schwarzschild\nsolution) and the Newtonian limit are recovered, as it is\nevident from (9), and it has been proved in [26]. This\n\n\f3\nimplies, also, that in order to study the corrections deriving from f (R) theories on the orbital elements in the\nSolar System, the terms proportional to k can be treated\nas a perturbation.\nFor further convenience, we remark that, thanks to the\nfollowing change of the radial variable\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm kr2\n,\n(10)\n\u2212\nr =r 1\u2212\nr\n12\nthe metric (9) can be written in isotropic form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2m kr 2\nds2 = \u2212 1 \u2212\n+\ndt2\nr\n3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0001\n2m kr 2\ndr 2 + r2 d\u03b82 + r 2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n+\n+ 1+\nr\n6\n(11)\nup to first order in m and k.\nIII.\n\nTHE IMPACT OF f (R) GRAVITY ON THE\nPLANETARY ORBITS\n\nAccording to what we have seen before, the modifications to the solutions of the field equations due to f (R)\n\ntheories are given by a term proportional to the Ricci\nscalar. As a consequence, from (11) we can consider a\nperturbation of the gravitational potential in the form\n\u2206U = \u03bar2 ,\n\nwhere \u03ba = k/3. In doing so, we neglect the effect of\nspatial curvature.\nFrom the potential (12) we obtain an entirely radial\nacceleration\nA = \u22122\u03bar.\n\n(13)\n\nIts effect on planetary motions, which is, of course,\nmuch smaller than usual Newtonian gravity, can straightforwardly be calculated within the usual perturbative\nschemes (see, for instance, [47]), i.e. using the Gauss\nequations, which enable us to study the perturbations\nof the Keplerian elements, induced by generic perturbing accelerations. Namely, the Gauss equations for the\nvariations of the semimajor axis a, the eccentricity e, the\ninclination i, the longitude of the ascending node \u03a9, the\nargument of pericentre \u03c9 and the mean anomaly M of a\ntest particle in the gravitational field of a body m are, in\ngeneral, given by\n\n\u0010 p \u0011i\nh\nda\n2\n,\neAr sin \u03c6 + At\n= \u221a\ndt\nr\nn 1 \u2212 e2\n\u221a\n\u0014\n\u001a\n\u0015\u001b\n1\u0010\nr\u0011\nde\n1 \u2212 e2\nAr sin \u03c6 + At cos \u03c6 +\n1\u2212\n,\n=\ndt\nna\ne\na\n\u0010r\u0011\ndi\n1\n\u221a\nAn\ncos(\u03c9 + \u03c6),\n=\ndt\na\nna 1 \u2212 e2\n\u0010r\u0011\n1\nd\u03a9\n\u221a\nsin(\u03c9 + \u03c6),\nAn\n=\ndt\na\nna sin i 1 \u2212 e2\n\u221a\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\nd\u03c9\nr\nd\u03a9\n1 \u2212 e2\n\u2212Ar cos \u03c6 + At 1 +\nsin \u03c6 ,\n= \u2212 cos i\n+\ndt\ndt\nnae\np\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010r\u0011 p\n2\nd\u03a9\ndM\nd\u03c9\n\u2212 1 \u2212 e2\n,\n= n\u2212\nAr\n+ cos i\ndt\nna\na\ndt\ndt\n\nin which n = 2\u03c0/P is the mean motion [58], P is the test\nparticle's orbital period, \u03c6 is the true anomaly counted\nfrom the pericentre, p = a(1 \u2212 e2 ) is the semilatus rectum of the Keplerian ellipse, Ar , At , An are the radial, transverse (in-plane components) and normal (outof-plane component) projections of the perturbing acceleration A, respectively, on the frame {r\u0302, t\u0302, n\u0302} comoving\nwith the particle.

For a discussion of such issues in\na different context see [50]. Each planetary perihelion\nis, thus, affected by such residual effects, so that it is\nnot possible to entirely attribute the determined extraadvances to the action of \u2206U of eq. (12), especially for\nMercury for which the mismodelled/unmodelled Newtonian and Einsteinian perturbations are stronger. A better way to use \u2206\u031f\n \u0307 is to suitably combine them in order\nMercury\nVenus\nEarth\nMars\nto make the estimate of \u03ba independent, by construction,\n\u22120.0036 \u00b1 0.0050 0.53 \u00b1 0.30 \u22120.0002 \u00b1 0.0004 0.0001 \u00b1 0.0005 of the Lense-Thirring and J \u2299 effects.

The gravitomagnetic force was not included in\nthe adopted dynamical force models. Data taken from Table\n3 of [49]. It is important to note that the quoted uncertainties\nare not the mere formal, statistical errors but are realistic in\nthe sense that they were obtained from comparison of many\ndifferent solutions with different sets of parameters and observations (Pitjeva, private communication 2005a). The correlations among such determined planetary perihelia rates are\nvery low with a maximum of about 20% between Mercury and\nthe Earth (Pitjeva, private communication 2005b).\n\nIV.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH THE LATEST DATA\n\nThe expressions obtained are useful for comparison with the latest data on planetary orbits from the\nEPM2004 ephemerides [48] by exploiting the determined\nextra-advances \u2206\u031f\n \u0307 of the longitudes of perihelia \u031f of\nthe inner planets (Table 3 of [49], here partly reproduced\nin Table I).\nThe extra-advances \u2206\u031f\n \u0307 determined in [49] are affected, in general, by all the Newtonian and nonNewtonian features of motion which have not been accounted for in the dynamical force models of EPM2004.\n\n|R| \u2264 3.12 \u00d7 10\u221225 s\u22122 ,\n\n(34)\n\nor, restoring units in such a way that R is measured in\nm\u22122 , we have\n|R| \u2264 3.47 \u00d7 10\u221242 m\u22122 .\n\n(35)\n\nSince the k parameter of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter\nmetric can be interpreted as a cosmological constant \u039b\n(see [39]), we get for \u039b the following limits\n\n\f5\nVI.\n\n|k| = |\u039b| \u2264 8.68 \u00d7 10\n\n\u221243\n\n\u22122\n\nm\n\n.\n\n(36)\n\nThis result is a much smaller than the one obtained in\n[36], and comparable to the those obtained in [37] and\n[52], but it is still several orders of magnitude greater\nthan the current value of the cosmological constant \u039b0 \u2243\n10\u221252 m\u22122 [53].\nAs we have seen in Sec. II, the k parameter is simply\nrelated to the solutions of the structural equation\nf \u2032 (R)R \u2212 2f (R) = 0,\n\n(37)\n\nR = F (\u03b11 , .., \u03b1N ).\n\n(38)\n\nnamely it is k = ci /4, where R = ci are the solutions of\neq. (37). As a consequence, the bounds on the \u03ba parameter, in principle, enable us to constrain the functions\nf (R). We may proceed as follows.\nIn general, the functions f , beyond the scalar curvature\nR, depend on a set of N constant parameters \u03b1j , j =\n1..N , so that we may write f = f (R, \u03b11 , .., \u03b1N ), and, on\nsolving eq. (37), we obtain\nConsequently, what we ultimately obtain is a limit on\nthe allowed values of the combination F of these parameters.\nIn [6] the Lagrangian\n\u03bc4\n(39)\nR\nwas introduced, and it was proved that it mimics cosmic acceleration without need for dark energy. However,\nwe point out that the Lagrangian (39) was found to be\ninstable [10, 11, 54]. For discussion on this issue, we refer to the recent paper by Faraoni [55]. Nonetheless, we\nconsider the Lagrangian (39) as an example in order to\nillustrate our approach, while a more general discussion\nwill be carried out elsewhere [56].\nThe Lagrangian (39) depends on the parameter \u03bc only,\nand eq. (38) becomes\n\u221a\n|R| = 3\u03bc2 ,\n(40)\nf (R) = R \u2212\n\nand, thanks to (36), we may set a limit on the parameter\n\u03bc:\n\u03bc \u2264 1.41 \u00d7 10\u221221 m\u22121 ,\n\n(41)\n\n\u03bc \u2264 2.80 \u00d7 10\u221228 eV.\n\n(42)\n\nor, since \u03bc is a parameter whose physical units are those\nof a mass,\nThis value is remarkably greater than estimate \u03bc \u2243\n10\u221233 eV [6], needed for f (R) gravity to explain the acceleration of the Universe without requiring dark matter.\nThe same result hold for the slightly different La4\ngrangian f (R) = R \u2212 \u03bcR + \u03b1R2 .\nThe same approach that we have briefly outlined here,\ncan be applied to other functions f (R), and it could be\nuseful, in particular, for those for which the structural\nequation can be solved analytically.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have studied the f (R) Higher Order Theories of Gravity and, in particular, the effects\nof the modifications of the Newtonian potential on the\nKeplerian orbital elements of the Solar System planets.\nStarting from an exact solution of the field equations in\nvacuum in the Palatini formalism, which corresponds to\nthe Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, we have considered\nthe perturbations of the orbital elements, by means of\nthe Gauss equations. We have showed that the longitudes of perihelia and the mean longitudes are affected by\nsecular precessions and, by comparison with the latest results in planetary orbit determination from the EPM2004\nephemerides, we have obtained the resulting best estimate of the parameter k which measures the non linearity\nof the gravitational theory. Since the k parameter can be\ninterpreted as a cosmological constant \u039b, our approach\nenables us to set the limit |\u039b| \u2264 8.68 \u00d7 10\u221243 m\u22122 , which\nis much smaller than the one obtained in [36] and comparable to the those obtained in [37, 52], but still too big\nif confronted with the current value of the cosmological\nconstant \u039b0 \u2243 10\u221252 m\u22122 . Furthermore, we have showed\nthat the best estimate of the parameter k, can be used\nto constrain the functions f (R). In particular, our approach is suitable for those f (R) for which the structural\nequation (37) can be solved analytically, thus allowing an\nexplicit evaluation of the parameters appearing in them\nfrom cosmological experiments results. As an example,\nwe have considered f (R) = R \u2212 \u03bc4 /R, and we have obtained the limit for the parameter \u03bc : \u03bc \u2264 2.80\u00d710\u221228eV,\nmuch greater than \u03bc \u2243 10\u221233 eV, required in order to\nagree with cosmological observations [6].\nWhat our results, in agreement with [36, 37, 38, 39],\nsuggest is that, in general, Solar System experiments are\nnot able to constrain k or the other related parameters\nup to orders of magnitude comparable to the cosmologically relevant values. On the other hand, this fact can\nbe also interpreted by saying that f (R) theories are viable on the Solar System scale, since their predictions\nare indistinguishable from GR ones, while they are appreciably different only on much larger scales, such as the\ncosmological one.\nAll we have done, refers to a solution of the field equation in vacuum, and corresponds to a space-time metric of\nconstant scalar curvature R. Actually, a complete study\nof the comparison between GR and f (R) theories needs\nmore general situations, such as, for instance, those requiring solutions of the field equations within the matter\ndistribution: this will be done elsewhere.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are very grateful to Prof. A.
