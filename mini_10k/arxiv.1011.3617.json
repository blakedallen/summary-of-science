Cross-hysteresis is studied.\nAtom-field interaction, nonlinear interaction, feedback, optical bistability.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nRecently optical and electro-optical devices with feedback control are used intensively in information\ntechnologies. Generating of laser pulses for transmitting through the optical waveguide and error correction during the\ninformation processing are remarkable instances here. In-depth information about feedback applications in classical\noptical processing can be found1. Quantum theory of feedback2 and its applications in designing of quantum memories3\nand implementation of quantum processing with embedded control4 are under consideration recently.\nIn nonlinear optical systems surrounded by loop of feedback optical bistability (OB) may appear5. Input \u2013\noutput relations are not unique in this case and determined by previous evolution of the system. Existence of several\noutput signal levels corresponded to the same input allows implementation of optical triggers, transistors and other basic\nelements of information processing1, 5. The main reasons of OB are the saturation of atomic transition and nonlinear\nrelationship between refractive index and electromagnetic field. The first of them associated with absorptive type of OB\nand second with dispersive type5, 6, 7. Two-state atom interacting with a mode of electromagnetic field in unidirectional\nring cavity is the simplest model of optical system with OB8, 9. To control the hysteresis parameters (thresholds, etc.)\neffectively one can use three-state atom of \u039b -type instead of two-state atom. This allows to insert an addition\n(controlling) electromagnetic field into the system10,11. Varying the parameters of controlling field gives the\ncomprehensive facilities in the changing of hysteresis parameters. Optical multistability (OM) in such system was\npredicted10. There are several works12, 13, 14 devoted to experimental observation of OB and OM by using the interaction\nbetween rubidium \u039b -atoms and electromagnetic field. Particularly, the transition from instability operation mode to\nbistable regime under different system parameters is investigated12. The relation between quantity of OB thresholds and\nintensity of controlling field is studied13. OM is observed14. It appears then two type of OB are observed simultaneously.\nThe requirement of OM observation is high optical density of the atomic vapors. Note, that nonlinear relation of\nabsorption factor from the intensity (amplitude) of the field is not unique which causes hysteresis. It is possible to\nobserve the hysteresis-type curve by considering the nonlinear relation between frequency detuning and absorption\nfactor15. Here we study the case then both two modes of electromagnetic field interacting with \u039b -atom is inserted in the\nfeedback. Absorptive type of OB in semiclassical mean field approximation and in stationary limit is under\nconsideration.\n\n\fA MODEL\nLet us put the cell with the vapors of \u039b -type atoms into the unidirectional cavity as it is pictured on fig.1.\nReflection and transmission coefficients of semitransparent mirrors M j , j = 1, 2 are labeled R j and T j\ncorrespondingly (T j + R j = 1) . For simplification we assume the remaining mirrors are of ideal reflectivity. Two modes\nE1 and E2 of classical electromagnetic field with the frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92 correspondingly are excited in the cavity.\n\nLet us denote their input intensities by I 0j and the intensity at the outcome of the cell by I out\nj . A part of radiation\ntransmitted through the cell being reflected from the mirrors is added to the input signal and come to input of the cell\nagain. Neglecting the effects of interference between input and redirected field we write the expression for intensities at\nthe input of the cell:\nI inj = I 0j + R j I out\nj .\n\n(\n\nDenoting the absorption factors of the cell by \u03b7 j = \u03b7 j I1in , I 2in\n\n)\n\n(\n\n(1)\n\nwe can write:\n\n)\n\nI out\n= \u03b7 j I1in , I 2in I inj .\nj\n\n(2)\n\nLet us rewrite the expression (1) using (2). The following system of nonlinear equations describing the intensities\nevolution in the cavity is obtained:\n1\n1\n(3)\n\u03b7 j ( I1in , I 2in ) =\n\u2212\nI 0j .\nR j R j I inj\n\n(\n\nTo evaluate the coefficient of absorption \u03b7 j I1in , I 2in\n\n)\n\nit is necessary to solve the master equation for the case of\n\natom \u2013 field interaction (see fig. 2). Let us consider the modes E1 and E2 interacting with atomic transitions 1 \u2192 2\nand 3 \u2192 2 correspondingly. Hamiltonian operator for the system in the rotating frame and resonant approximation\nmay be written as follows:\n\nH = \u22061\u03c3 22 + \u2206 2\u03c3 33 + \u03a9 1 (\u03c312 + \u03c3 21 ) + \u03a9 2 (\u03c3 23 + \u03c3 32 ) .\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03a9 1 , \u03a9 2 are Rabi frequencies of acting fields and \u03c3 kr = k r , k , r = 1, 2,3 are atomic projectors onto the\nsubspaces generated by eigenvectors of Hamiltonian H 0 of pure atomic system:\n\nH 0 k = Ek k .\n\n(5)\n\n\u22061 = \u03b51 , \u2206 2 = \u03b5 2 \u2212 \u03b51 are single and two-photon detunings, \u03b51 = E2 \u2212 E1 \u2212 \u03c91 , \u03b5 2 = E2 \u2212 E3 \u2212 \u03c92 .\n\nWe will seek for the stationary density matrix of atom-field system which changes at the frequencies of acting\nmodes and their integer combinations. We will use the following master equation in the stationary limit:\n\n[ H , \u03c1 ] + iG \u03c1 = 0 .\n\nFigure 1. Unidirectional ring cavity with an atomic sample.\n\nFigure 2. Three-state atom driven by electromagnetic fields.\n\n(6)\n\n\fHere G is a relaxation superoperator:\n\n( G \u03c1 )i j\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\u23a7 \u2212 \u03c1i j \u0393i j , \u0393 i j = \u0393 j i , i \u2260 j;\n\u23aa\n=\u23a8 3\n\u23aa \u2211 \u03b3 k j \u03c1 k k \u2212 \u03b3 j k \u03c1 j j , i = j.\n\u23a9 k =1\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(7)\n\nThe absorption factors \u03b7 j I1in , I 2in may be evaluated in the following way:\n\n(\n\n)\n\n\u03b7 j ( I1in , I 2in ) = exp 2k Im 1 + 4\u03c0\u03c7 j .\n\n(8)\n\nHere k is wave number, \u03c7 j is an electromagnetic susceptibilities at the transition j \u2192 j + 1 , j = 1, 2 . It may be\nobtained as follows:\nNa D j\n\n\u03c7j =\n\n2\n\n\u03c1 j , j +1 ,\n\n=\u03b5 0 \u03a9 j\n\n(9)\n\nwhere N a is atomic concentration in the cell, D j is dipole moment of corresponding transition and \u03c1 j , j +1 is the density\nmatrix element.\n\nRESULTS\n3.1 Input intensity trajectories and stability criterion\n\nHere we represent the solution of the nonlinear system (3) with coefficients of absorption from (8) which is\nobtained numerically. On fig.3a two curves representing the set of solutions for each equation of system (3) are shown.\nThe input intensities I10 and I 20 are fixed. The intersection points of these two curves correspond to solutions of the\nsystem. For the comparison these curves are depicted in the case then R1 = 0 , R2 = 0, 6 (fig.3b). It is evidently that\nswitching on the second loop of feedback follows appearing additional solutions of (3). We will show further that in the\n\n(\n\ndomain I10 , I 20\n\n)\n\nthere such solutions appear the hysteresis-type relation between input intensity of one field and output\n\nintensity of another field may be observed.\nIn analogous with system containing one loop of feedback there are stable and unstable solutions among all\nobtained from (3). An unstable solution is never appears at the output of the system, but transfer to the one of the stable\nsolutions. In the case of one feedback loop an unstable solutions correspond to that peace of the input-output curve which\nhas negative slope for the S-type systems and positive slope for the N-type systems. The case of two loops of feedback\nrequires conditions which allow classifying all solutions gained. We will use the facts from bifurcation theory. Let us\nlinearize system (3) and estimate the norm of the following matrix L2\u00d7 2 :\nL jk =\n\n(\n\n\u2202\u03b7 j I1in , I 2in\n\nI 0j R j\n\n(\n\n\u23a11 + R j\u03b7 j I , I\n\u23a3\nin\n1\n\nin\n2\n\n)\n\n\u23a4\n\u23a6\n\n\u2202I\n\n2\n\nin\nk\n\n),\n\nj, k = 1, 2 .\n\n(10)\n\nStable solution of (3) corresponds to the point in which L 2 < 1 . Required matrix norm may be obtained approximately\nas follows:\nL\n\n2\n\n(\n\n)\n\n= \u03bbmax LT L .\n\n(11)\n\nHere \u03bbmax ( A ) is a maximal eigenvalue of corresponding matrix A . Applying this criterion to the points depicted in\nfig.3a we can find that solutions 1 and 3 are stable and 2 is unstable. This method of determining stability is universal\nand may be used both in the case of one feedback loop and in the case then its number greater than one.\n\n\fa)\n\nb)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nFigure 3. The solution of the nonlinear system (3) under certain quantity of input intensities I10 , I 20 : a) two loops of\nfeedback are switched on and R1 = R2 = 0.6 ; b) one loop of feedback is switched on ( R1 = 0 , R2 = 0.6 ); other\nparameters are represented in Appendix.\n\n3.2 Bistability domain\n\n(\n\n)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nSelecting the points I10 , I 20 where there are exist more than one solution I1in , I 2in of (3) one can obtain the set\nlike are depicted on fig. 4 in the location of input intensities I10 , and I 20 . This is an OB domain of absorptive type. In\ngeneral it shares the plane on three different parts: interior domain Va , OB domain and exterior domain Vt . It will be\nshown further that these parts correspond to the different absorptive roles in the atomic sample. For instance, in Va\nexponential absorption is observed (absorbing domain) while Vt corresponds to linear absorption low (transparent\ndomain). Bistability domain is a boundary region where the type of absorptive role changes. Its form and magnitude\ndepends on the system parameters in a complicated manner. The main of these relations we consider qualitatively. In fig.\n4a the bistability domain under different quantities of single photon detunings is depicted. It is expected that in the limit\nof two photon resonance ( \u2206 2 = 0 ) absorptive bistability domain disappears. Fig. 4b and 4c shows the dependence on the\nreflection coefficients of semitransparent mirrors R1 and R2 .\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nFigure 4. OB domain: a) R1 = R2 = 0.99 , \u03b51 = \u2212\u03b5 2 = 0.4 (black); \u03b51 = \u2212\u03b5 2 = 0.7 (dark grey); \u03b51 = \u2212\u03b5 2 = 1 (grey);\nb) R1 = R2 = 0.75 , \u03b51 = \u2212\u03b5 2 = 0.7 ; c) R1 = R2 = 0.6 , \u03b51 = \u2212\u03b5 2 = 0.7 ; other parameters are represented in Appendix.\n\n3.3 Input-output relations, cross-hysteresis\n\nHere we will find the relations between input intensities I10 , I 20 and output intensities I1out , I 2out for different\ntrajectories in the location of I10 , I 20 . The parameters of OB domain are the same which used for fig. 4c to show. Let us\n\n( )\n\n( )\n\nstart form the case then I 20 is fixed and I10 varies. On figs. 5 the input \u2013 output dependences I1out I10 and I 2out I10 for\n0\n2\n\ncertain quantity of I are depicted. There are hysteresis-type curves. The relation I\n\nout\n2\n\n( I ) shown on fig. 5b we called\n0\n1\n\n\f(\n\n)\n\ncross-hysteresis. As it was mentioned above the low level output signal corresponds to the quantities I10 , I 20 , which lies\nin the domain Va . The regions with high level output signal are conditioned by\n\n(I\n\n0\n1\n\n, I 20\n\n)\n\nlying in the transparency\n\ndomain Vt . Notice, the location of hysteresis branches which separate the regions of high and low output intensities are\nin correspondence with fig. 4c. Getting I10 fixed and varying I 20 follows the similar results.\nModifying one of the input intensities provides the way to control the hysteresis and cross-hysteresis\nparameters. To advance the facilities of input-output controlling we can vary the input intensities in more complicate\nmanner. For the instance they can be changed by obeying some role. Here we consider the particular case when whole\nOB domain is passed through. We will use parametrically coupled input intensities I1out ( t ) , I 2out ( t ) for it. The required\ntrajectory is shown on fig. 6a. Here the points lying on the curve is the quantities of parameter t which are used for\nconvenience in constructing of further figures. The output intensities as functions of parameter t corresponding to\nconsidered trajectory are depicted on fig. 6b and 6c. The forward and backward passes are marked by the arrows. Their\nessential difference is conditioned by different rates between initial quantities of input intensities. Namely, in the case of\nforward pass we have I10 \u0013 I 20 and the second field makes corresponding atomic transition transparent while another\ntransition leaves \"dark\". In the opposite case of backward pass we have I10 \u0015 I 20 and atomic transition 1 \u2192 2 is\ntransparent while another is \"dark\". Choosing the point of leaving OB domain one can obtain a number of possibilities to\nget required thresholds and distance between different hysteresis branches. All of these essentially expand the facility of\ncontrolling the hysteresis.\n\na)\n\nb)\n\n( )\n\n( )\n\nFigure 5.

Solutions of nonlinear system of equations describing feedback are found and classified due to\nnumerical counting. Two dimensional OB domain is obtained and dependence of its form and magnitude on the certain\ncontrolling system parameters is shown. The consideration of different trajectories passing through this domain allowed\nrevealing the possibilities of hysteresis control. Particularly it allows observing the cross-hysteresis. The comparison of\nthe results gained form numerical counting and analytical expressions in two-level system approximation are done.\n\n\fSurely, more careful model must include transient process, the interference effects between modes of radiation and\ntransfer effects in the cell. In spite of this imperfection the initial data which were taken from theoretical and\nexperimental works 11, 13 and evaluated within the bounds of model presented here gives the results which are in\nagreement with results obtained in mentioned works.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was supported by the Analytical Departmental Targeted Program \"Development of Scientific\nPotential of Higher School (2009\u20132010), project 2.1.1/4215, by the Grant of the St. Petersburg Government for Students\nand Postgraduates of Higher Education Schools and Academic Institutes of St. Petersburg.\nReferences\n\n[1] Arrathoon R., [Optical computing: digital and symbolic], Marcel Dekker inc., New York & Basel, 441 p.
