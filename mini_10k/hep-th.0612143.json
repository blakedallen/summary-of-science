Earlier work in a somewhat similar spirit\nincludes [4]. Independently, a proposal was made in [5] for extracting the jet-quenching\nparameter q\u0302 for N = 4 gauge theory from a Wilson loop calculation amenable to solution\n\nthrough techniques of classical string theory.1 Subsequent work includes extensions to non-\n\nconformal theories [9, 10, 11, 12], non-zero chemical potentials [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], and\nother deformations of N = 4 gauge theory [19]; studies of directional emission [20, 21]\nand the relation to the magnetic string tension [22]; and calculations of drag on particles\ncarrying higher representations of the gauge group [23]. The venue for the string theory\ncalculations is the gauge-string duality [24, 25, 26] (for reviews see [27, 28, 29]), in particular\nthe computation of Wilson loops through dual classical configurations of fundamental strings\nin anti-de Sitter space, as first considered in [30, 31].\nThe drag force calculations [1, 2, 3] result in a relaxation time tD for charm quarks that\nis in the right ballpark for comparison with data on the nuclear modification factor RAA\nand the elliptic flow parameter v2 for heavy quarks, as reported most recently by the STAR\nand PHENIX collaborations in [32, 33]. According to the prescription for comparing N = 4\n\ngauge theory and QCD advocated in [34], the string theory prediction is tD = 2.1 \u00b1 1 fm/c\n\nfor charm quarks. This value is lower than typical values tD \u223c 4.5 fm/c used in one of the\n\nmore successful phenomenological theories [35] of heavy-quark transport. But one should\nbear in mind that many steps separate the drag force calculation from predictions of RAA\n\nand v2 . Prominent among these steps is a description of heavy quark propagation through\nthe QGP which includes fluctuations in the force on the quark. The goal of this paper is to\ncalculate the two-point functions of these fluctuations using the gauge-string duality.\nThe organization of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section 2 sets the stage by\nreviewing the diffusion of momentum of a heavy quark in a Langevin formalism. Section 3\nsets up the main calculation by finding the quadratic action and equations of motion for\nfluctuations of the trailing string. Section 4 shows how to translate appropriate solutions\nof these equations of motion into the Green's functions of interest. Section 5 shows how to\n1\n\nThere exists some debate in the literature regarding the calculation of [5]. Arguments from both sides\nof this debate can be found in [6, 7, 8].\n\n1\n\n\ftreat the zero-temperature case analytically. Section 6 presents a numerical study of the\ntwo-point function of primary interest. Section 7 includes a discussion of how the string\ntheory results might be applied to understanding heavy quarks propagating through a realworld quark-gluon plasma. This discussion suffers from the usual difficulties of relating two\nsignificantly different theories, namely N = 4 super-Yang-Mills and QCD. Some significant\n\ntechnical issues are postponed to three appendices.\n\n2\n\nMomentum diffusion in a Langevin description\n\nFollowing [36] one may attempt to describe the propagation of a heavy quark through a\nthermal bath in terms of Langevin dynamics (see also, for example, [37, 38]):\ndpi\n= \u2212\u03b7D (p) pi + FiL + FiT\ndt\nhFiL (t1 )FjL (t2 )i = \u03baL (p) p\u0302i p\u0302j \u03b4(t1 \u2212 t2 )\n\n(1)\n\nhFiT (t1 )FjT (t2 )i = \u03baT (p) (\u03b4ij \u2212 p\u0302i p\u0302j )\u03b4(t1 \u2212 t2 ) ,\nwhere p\u0302i = pi /p is the unit 3-vector in the direction of the momentum p~. The string theory\nprediction for the drag force (ignoring issues of modified dispersion relations raised in [1])\namounts to\n\u03c0\n\u03b7D =\n2\n\nq\nT2\n,\ngY2 M N\nm\n\n(2)\n\nindependent of p, where m is the mass of the heavy quark. It is often assumed (modulo\na subtlety having to do with how one discretizes the Langevin equations in the process of\npassing to a Fokker-Planck description) that \u03baL and \u03b7D are constrained by the Einstein\nrelation\n\nwhere\n\nq\n\u03baL = 2T E \u03b7D = \u03c0 gY2 M N T 3 \u03b3 ,\n\u03b3=\u221a\n\n1\n1 \u2212 v2\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nis the standard Lorentz factor for the heavy quark (and I have again ignored the possibility\nof a modified dispersion relation). The relation (3) emerges from requiring that a heavy\nquark propagating according to the equations (1) should eventually equilibrate to a thermal\ndistribution e\u2212E/T , so it is a consistency condition for the Langevin approach. No such\nrelation is available for \u03baT , but for non-relativistic quarks isotropy demands \u03baT = \u03baL . Indeed,\n\n2\n\n\fthe result\n\n2T 2\n=\u03c0\n\u03baL = \u03baT =\nD\n\nq\ngY2 M N T 3\n\nfor v \u226a 1\n\n(5)\n\nwas obtained through direct calculation in [3] and through use of the Einstein relation in [1].\nThe Langevin approach (1) is hardly the only one in use for describing quark dynamics in\nthe QGP. Another prominent paradigm hinges on radiative energy loss [39, 40, 41]. Central\ninterest in this description attaches to the BDMPS jet-quenching parameter q\u0302. The jetquenching parameter as I prefer to define it is\nq\u0302T = hp2\u22a5 i/\u03bb .\n\n(6)\n\nHere hp2\u22a5 i is the average transverse momentum acquired by a parton after it has traveled\n\na distance \u03bb, measured in the rest frame of the plasma.2 The path length \u03bb is supposed\nto be taken large enough so that short-range correlations are washed out, but short enough\nso that the quark is only slightly deflected from its original trajectory. A definition of q\u0302\nthat is preferred in some works, for example [5, 7], refers to a partially light-like Wilson\nloop. To distinguish between the q\u0302 of these works and the definition I prefer, I will employ\na subscripted T as in (6). Note that the definition of q\u0302T does not require a strict light-like\nlimit: it can be evaluated at any v. Also, does not require us to commit to the BDMPS\n\nformalism. For example, consider a Langevin description of momentum broadening where\na heavy quark travels initially in the x1 direction and is acted on by stochastic transverse\nforces satisfying\n\ndpi\n(7)\n= Fi\nhFi (t1 )Fj (t2 )i = \u03b4ij KT (t1 \u2212 t2 ) ,\ndt\nwhere KT (t) is an integrable function and i, j run over values 2, 3. If one assumes p\u22a5 (0) = 0,\nthen at sufficiently late times t (meaning times larger than the characteristic time-scales of\nKT (t)) one has\n2\n\nij\n\nhp\u22a5 (t) i = \u03b4 hpi (t)pj (t)i =\nwhere by definition\n\u03baT =\n\nZ\n\nt\n\ndt1\n\n0\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nt\n0\n\ndt2 2KT (t1 \u2212 t2 ) \u2248 2\u03baT t ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u221e\n\ndt KT (t) .\n\n(9)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n2\n\nI would use pT in place of p\u22a5 except for the fact that pT is usually reserved for momentum perpendicular\nto the beampipe. If the parton is traveling in the x1 direction, then ~p\u22a5 is the projection of the momentum\nonto the x2 -x3 plane.\n\n3\n\n\fComparing with (6), one extracts\nq\u0302T =\n\n2\u03baT\n.\nv\n\n(10)\n\nFor a heavy quark with a known initial momentum, one may also consider\nq\u0302L = h(\u2206pL )2 i/\u03bb\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u2206pL is the deviation of the longitudinal momentum of a heavy quark from some\naverage value. As with q\u0302T , the definition (11) doesn't commit us to a specific formalism;\nhowever, a Langevin analysis precisely analogous to the one leading to (10) gives\nq\u0302L =\nwhere\n\u03baL =\n\nZ\n\n\u03baL\nv\n\n(12)\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt hF1 (t)F1 (0)i\n\n(13)\n\nand F1 is the fluctuating part of the longitudinal force.\nThe AdS/CFT calculations that are the focus of sections 3-6 lead to force correlators\nfrom which q\u0302L and q\u0302T may be extracted, essentially as in (9), (10), (12), and (13). The\nresults are\n\nq\n\u221a\nq\u0302T = 2\u03c0 gY2 M N T 3 \u03b3/v\n\nq\nq\u0302L = \u03c0 gY2 M N T 3 \u03b3 5/2 /v .\n\n(14)\n\nThe result (14) is larger by a factor 1/(1 \u2212 v 2 )3/4 than expected from (3). So Langevin\ndynamics does not capture the whole story. The method for obtaining (14) is to numerically\n\ncompute a symmetrized Wightman two-point function of oscillations of the trailing string\nsolution of [1, 2] and identify the zero-frequency component of this two-point function with\n\u03baL or \u03baT as appearing in (9) and (13). The expressions in (14) are obtained as a fit to\nthe low-frequency limit of the numerics, but they are probably exact statements about the\nGreen's functions in question.3\n\n3\n\nFluctuations of the trailing string\n\nThe drag force prediction from the gauge-string duality,\nd~p\n\u03c0\n= \u2212\u03b7D ~p = \u2212\ndt\n2\n3\n\nq\n\ngY2 M N T 2\n\np~\n,\nm\n\nI thank C.

The most interesting of these is y = yS ,\ncorresponding to some intermediate point on the string. What is special about this point is\nthat it is the location of a horizon of the induced metric on the worldsheet. An intuitive way\nto see this is that a point on the trailing string with y held fixed follows a timelike trajectory if\ny < yS and a spacelike one if y > yS .4 So the region y < yS corresponds to the exterior of the\n\"black hole on the worldsheet,\" and y > yS corresponds to the interior. No signal from the\ninterior can propagate classically to the exterior. Instead, signals in the interior region must\nby causality travel down the string. But there should be some Hawking radiation from the\nworldsheet horizon upward toward y = 0, and it is natural to suppose that it relates to the\nmomentum diffusion. I will not make this connection directly, but the two-point functions\nthat I will compute are related to both classical absorption and spontaneous emission by the\nworldsheet horizon.\nAlthough (26) does not seem to be explicitly solvable, certain limits of it are tractable.\n4\n\nA closely related observation [1, 42, 43, 6] is that there are no-drag configurations of mesons represented\nas strings with both ends attached to branes in AdS5 -Schwarzschild provided the string between the quarks\nhangs no lower than y = yS .\n\n6\n\n\fFor example, to next-to-leading order in small y, two independent solutions are\n\u03c8Def (\u03c9, y) = 1 +\n\n2\n\u03c9 2 zH\n2\n4\n4 y + O(y )\n2yS\n\n\u03c8VEV (\u03c9, y) = y 3 \u2212\n\n2\n\u03c9 2 zH\n5\n6\n4 y + O(y ) ,\n10yS\n\n(28)\n\nand to leading order in small positive yS \u2212 y, two independent solutions are\n\u03c8\u2212 (\u03c9, y) = 1 + O(yS \u2212 y)\n\n\u03c8+ (\u03c9, y) = (yS \u2212 y)i\u03c9zH /2yS [1 + O(yS \u2212 y)] .\n\n(29)\n\nOf the two solutions in (29), \u03c8+ (\u03c9, y) corresponds to an outgoing wave, because the phase\nincreases as one goes to smaller values of y. The standard horizon boundary condition,\nthen, is to disallow this solution. To justify this statement completely, one should show that\nsuppressing this solution amounts to stipulating that \u03a8(\u03c9, t, y) should depend only on the\ninfalling coordinate at the horizon. This is indeed true, because, to leading order close to\nthe horizon, the infalling and outgoing coordinates are\nu\u2212 = t\n\nu+ = t \u2212\n\nzH\nlog(yS \u2212 y) .\n2yS\n\n(30)\n\nA justification of (30) is postponed to appendix A.\nConsider now a set of wave-functions \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, y) = e\u2212i\u03c9t \u03c8R (\u03c9, y), defined so that\n\u03c8R (\u03c9, y) = \u03c8Def (\u03c9, y) + CR (\u03c9)\u03c8VEV (\u03c9, y) = C\u2212H (\u03c9)\u03c8\u2212 (\u03c9, y) .\n\n(31)\n\nIn (31), \u03c8Def , \u03c8VEV , and \u03c8\u00b1 are regarded as exact solutions of the radial equation (26),\nspecified by their asymptotics at y = 0 or y = yS . In the absence of an analytical solution\nto (27), the quantities CR (\u03c9) and C\u2212H (\u03c9) must be determined through some approximation\nscheme or through numerics. The wave-functions \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, y) have several useful properties:\n1. \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, y) is a solution of the wave equation (24) for \u03c6.\n2. \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, 0) = e\u2212i\u03c9t .\n3. \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, y)\u2217 = \u03a8R (\u2212\u03c9, t, y). To see this, note that complex conjugation is equivalent\nto sending \u03c9 \u2192 \u2212\u03c9 in the radial equation (26), and that the boundary condition at\n\nthe horizon is preserved by complex conjugation. This property guarantees that \u03c6(t, y)\nis real everywhere provided \u03c60 (\u03c9)\u2217 = \u03c60 (\u2212\u03c9).\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nMomentum correlators from the trailing string\n\nAs in the previous section, let \u03c6 be one of the \u03b4xi . Let O be the operator dual to \u03c6, and let\nG \u03b1\u03b2 = GL\u03b1\u03b2 or GT\u03b1\u03b2 , as appropriate. The retarded, time-ordered, and symmetrized Wightman\ntwo-point functions are defined as\n\nGR (t) = \u2212i\u03b8(t)h[O(t), O(0)]i\nGF (t) = \u2212ihT {O(t)O(0)}i\n1\nG(t) = hO(t)O(0) + O(0)O(t)i\n2\n\n(32)\n\nwhere in general\n\ntr e\u2212\u03b2H Q\n,\ntr e\u2212\u03b2H\nand H is the Hamiltonian of the gauge theory.\n\n(33)\n\nhQi =\n\nIn analogy to the recipe of [44], the proposal for extracting the retarded Green's function\nfrom the wave-functions \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, y) is\nGR (\u03c9) = \u2212\u03a8\u2217R (\u03c9, t, y)G y\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, y)\n\ny=0\n\n= \u2212G y\u03b2 \u2202\u03b2 log \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, y)\n\ny=0\n\n,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the notation |y=0 means to evaluate at y = 0 after taking the derivatives. The difference\n\nbetween (34) and (3.15) of [44] is the use of \u03a8R rather than \u03c8R .5 Using \u03c8R would amount\n\nto restricting the sum over \u03b2 to \u03b2 = y, and this does not make sense in light of worldsheet\nreparametrization invariance. If the number current associated with \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, y) is defined as\nJ\u03b1 =\n\n1 \u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 \u2194\nG \u03a8R \u2202\u03b2 \u03a8R ,\n2i\n\n(35)\n\nthen\nIm GR (\u03c9) = \u2212J y ,\n\n(36)\n\nand because J \u03b1 is conserved, the right hand side of (36) can be evaluated at any y. The\nnumber flux is positive at the horizon for \u03c9 > 0 as a consequence of the infalling boundary\nconditions, so one finds from (36) that\nIm GR (\u03c9) < 0\n\nfor \u03c9 > 0.\n\n(37)\n\nThis is the correct sign for describing dissipative dynamics. If \u03c8R had been used instead of\n5\n\nActually there seems to be one further difference: an overall sign. Possibly I have misunderstood the\nnotation used [44]. Anyway, I claim that the sign in (34) is the right one.\n\n8\n\n\f\u03a8R , the connection with the conserved number current would be broken. In [44] a restriction\nwas made to consider only diagonal metrics, so the question of including dependence of the\nwave-function on coordinates other than the radial one never arose. (The context was slightly\ndifferent: instead of G \u03b1\u03b2 , the metric of interest was the line element of the bulk spacetime.)\n\nBut (34) is clearly in the spirit of [44] and its antecedent [25]: note for instance the similarity\nwith (27) of [25].\nThe quadratic part of the on-shell action reduces to\nSon\u2212shell\n\n1\n=\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c60 (\u2212\u03c9)\u03c60(\u03c9) Re GR (\u03c9) ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere to obtain the right hand side from the quadratic part of SNG I used an integration\nby parts, the equations of motion, the formula (34), and the property GR (\u2212\u03c9) = GR (\u03c9)\u2217 ,\nwhich is obvious from property 3 at the end of section 3.\nThus, just as in the examples treated in [44], the real part of GR (\u03c9) may be extracted\nusing a conventional AdS/CFT formulation in which the on-shell action is the generating\nfunctional for Green's functions. But it turns out that the imaginary part will be of greater\ninterest, due to its connection with the dissipative dynamics. The relation between Im GR (\u03c9)\nand G(\u03c9),\nG(\u03c9) = \u2212 coth\n\n\u03c9\nIm GR (\u03c9) ,\n2T yS\n\n(39)\n\nis modified from the usual one in that T yS appears in place of T . A justification of (39),\nfollowing [45], is postponed to Appendix B.\nHere is a somewhat informal argument for identifying O(t) with minus the force on\n\nthe quark in the direction that \u03c6 selects. To be precise, let \u03c6 = \u03b4x2 : then the claim is\nO(t) = \u2212\u1e572 (t). Consider the action\nSq [\u03c6(t)] =\n\nZ\n\ndt L(\u03c6\u03070 )\n\n(40)\n\nfor an external quark propagating through the thermal medium along a path\nx1 (t) = vt\n\nx2 (t) = \u03c60 (t) .\n\n(41)\n\nI have excluded explicit dependence on \u03c60 and t from L because the medium is assumed to\nbe translationally invariant and static. Note that translational invariance does not imply\nconservation of transverse momentum: Sq is evaluated under the path integral and includes\n\n9\n\n\fcouplings to the gauge theory. For small deviations \u03c60 from a straight path,\nSq \u2248\n\nZ\n\n\u2202L\ndt \u03c6\u03070\n=\n\u2202 \u03c6\u03070\n\nZ\n\ndt \u03c6\u03070p\u03c6 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\ndt \u03c60 \u1e57\u03c6 .\n\n(42)\n\nOf course, p\u03c6 = p2 . Altogether, the generating functional for the two-point functions of\ninterest is\nZ[\u03c60 ] =\n\n\u001c\n\n\u001a\n\nexp \u2212i\n\nZ\n\ndt \u03c60\u1e572\n\n\u001b\u001d\n\n,\n\n(43)\n\nwhence the desired conclusion O = \u2212\u1e572 . More formally, p2 (t) should be regarded as the\noperator which generates a local displacement at time t of the path of the Wilson loop for\n\nthe external quark. A similar line of argument applies when \u03c6 = \u03b4x1 , and of course \u03b4x3 is\nequivalent to \u03b4x2 .\nOther Green's functions than GR (\u03c9) could be computed by using other wave-functions\nthan \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, y) in (34), provided they satisfy the three properties at the end of section 3.\nFor example, wave-functions \u03a8A (\u03c9, t, y) = e\u2212i\u03c9t \u03c8A (\u03c9, y) with \u03c8A proportional to \u03c8+ should\nlead to the advanced Green's function.\n\n5\n\nZero-temperature Green's functions\n\nAs a check on the validity of the prescription (34), and as a way of understand the \u03c9 \u226b T\n\nbehavior in the T 6= 0 case, it is useful to detour to a consideration of the zero temperature\n\nlimit, where the background metric is just\nds2 =\n\nL2\n(\u2212dt2 + d~x2 + dz 2 )\nz2\n\n(44)\n\nand the unperturbed solution is a string that hangs straight down:\nx1 = vt\n\nx2 = x3 = 0 .\n\n(45)\n\nI will use worldsheet coordinates \u03c3 \u03b1 = (t, z). An expansion entirely analogous to (20) can\nbe performed, only now the integration measure is dtdz, and\nP\u03b1 = 0\n\nGT\u03b1\u03b2 = (1 \u2212 v 2 )GL\u03b1\u03b2\n\n10\n\nL2 /z 2\n\u03b3\n=\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0 \u22121/\u03b3 2\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(46)\n\n\fThe wave-functions satisfying infalling boundary conditions at the degenerate horizon at\nz = \u221e were found analytically for v = 0 in [46] and can be adapted immediately to the case\nof interest:\n\n2\n\n\u03a8R (\u03c9, t, z) = e\u2212i\u03c9t ei\u03b3\u03c9z/yS (1 \u2212 i\u03b3\u03c9z) .\n\n(47)\n\nThe retarded Green's functions are\n1 R\niL2 \u03b3 2 3\nG\n(\u03c9)\n=\n\u2212\n\u03c9 ,\n\u03b32 L\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\nGR\nT (\u03c9) =\n\n(48)\n\nwhere I have dropped a divergent term proportional to \u03c9 2 whose Fourier transform is a\ncontact term supported at t = 0.

One\n4\ncan see already in (48) and (52) a very strong dependence: GR\nL \u221d \u03b3 for fixed \u03c9 or t. In\n\nthis zero-temperature setting, the factors of \u03b3 should be capable of being understood just in\nterms of Lorentz invariance. As a step in this direction, consider the following toy model:\n11\n\n\fN = 4 super-Yang-Mills with gauge group U(1). The action for the heavy quark is\nS=\n\nZ\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds \u2212m|\u1e8b| + A\u03bc \u1e8b\u03bc + |\u1e8b|\u03b8I X I ,\n\n(53)\n\nwhere dots denote d/ds and the parameter s need not be the proper time \u03c4 . The \u03b8I form\na unit vector in R6 , and they specify properties of the quark: its scalar \"charges.\" For an\nexternal quark, one specifies the \u03b8I as functions of s along with the trajectory x\u03bc (s). The\nonly case I will consider (which is also the case considered in [1, 3, 2]) is the one where the\n\u03b8I are constant. The classical equation of motion following from (53) is\nmu\u0307\u03bc = W\u03bc + \u03b8I X I u\u0307\u03bc ,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere I have now specialized to the case where s is the proper time \u03c4 , and\n\u03bd\n\nW\u03bc \u2261 F\u03bc\u03bd u +\n\nI\nI \u2202X\n\u03b8\n(\u03b4\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u2202x\n\n+ u\u03bd u\u03bc ) .\n\n(55)\n\nThe velocity vector u\u03bc = dx\u03bc /d\u03c4 satisfies\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd u\u03bc u\u03bd = \u22121\n\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = diag{\u22121, 1, 1, 1} .\n\n(56)\n\nLet's now promote F\u03bc\u03bd (t, ~x) and X I (t, ~x) to operator-valued fields and consider the symmetrized Wightman two-point function of W\u03bc (\u03c4 ). Because of conformal invariance and the\nobvious identity W\u03bc u\u03bc = 0, the answer can only be\n\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + u\u03bc u\u03bd\n1\nGW\n\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c4 ) \u2261 hW\u03bc (\u03c4 )W\u03bd (0) + W\u03bd (0)W\u03bc (\u03c4 )i = CW\n2\n\u03c44\n\n(57)\n\nfor some constant CW .\nWhether W\u03bc is the entire \"force\" acting on the quark depends on whether the last term\n\nin (54) is considered a force or a modification of the momentum. This is immaterial for\nexternal quarks because their mass is infinite and their trajectory can be prescribed to have\nconstant u\u03bc . So for the purposes of comparing (57) to (52), this term doesn't matter. What\ndoes matter is that, in deriving (52), the force was defined in terms of a t derivative, not a\n\u03c4 derivative:\nFi =\n\ndpi\n1 dpi\n=\n= \u03b3Wi .\ndt\n\u03b3 d\u03c4\n\n(58)\n\nUsing (57) and (58), and assuming as usual that the quark moves in the x1 direction, one\n\n12\n\n\fobtains\n\n1\n1\n4 CW\n,\nGL (t) = hF1 (t)F1 (0) + F1 (0)F1 (t)i = 2 GW\n11 (t/\u03b3) = \u03b3\n2\n\u03b3\nt4\n\n(59)\n\nand similarly GT (t) = \u03b3 2 CW /t4 . Thus there is perfect agreement with (52) if one formally\nmakes the replacement CW \u2192 3L2 /\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u2032 .\n\nThe simple-minded analysis leading to (59) of course makes no prediction about the\n\nscaling of the low-frequency parts of GL (\u03c9) and GT (\u03c9) with \u03b3 when the temperature is\nnon-zero. But what drives the relation GL (\u03c9) = \u03b3 2 GT (\u03c9) is the corresponding relation\nGL\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b3 2 GT\u03b1\u03b2 , and this holds whether T is zero or not.\n\n6\n\nNumerical results\n\nStarting from (22), (31), (34), and (39), a short calculation shows that\nGR\nT (\u03c9) = \u2212Y (2CR (\u03c9) + iX)\nwhere\n\n2\nX \u2261 v 2 \u03b3 2 \u03c9zH\n3\n\nGT (\u03c9) = Y coth\n\nY \u2261\n\n\u03c9\n(2 Im CR (\u03c9) + X)\n2T yS\n\n3 L2\n3\n=\n3\n3\n\u2032\n4\u03c0\u03b3zH \u03b1\n4\u03c0\u03b3zH\n\nq\n\ngY2 M N .\n\n(60)\n\n(61)\n\nThe longitudinal Green's functions are always \u03b3 2 times the transverse ones. Only GT (\u03c9) will\nbe evaluated explicitly here.

By visual inspection, the scale l\u2217 for the characteristic structures in\ngT (l) is l\u2217 \u2248 1.5.\n\nBecause of the leading |w|3 behavior in gT (w) at large w, the real space form gT (l) is\n\nhighly divergent at small l. This leading divergence is precisely the behavior observed in the\nzero-temperature Green's function in section 5. Contact terms supported at l = 0 restore\nintegrability at the origin. A simple strategy for finding gT (l) is to subtract the |w|3 term\n\nfrom gT (w) and perform a numerical Fourier transform on the remainder, cut off at some\nmaximum frequency W . The trouble with this strategy is that the subleading 1/|w| behavior\nin gT (w) leads to errors of order log(W |l|) at small l. Subtracting this subleading behavior\n\nas well leads to a remainder which is absolutely integrable at large w but not at small w.\nThe simplest form I could find that agrees with the large w asymptotics in (68) to the order\n\n14\n\n\fgT HwL\n\ngT HlL\n10\n\n20\n\n8\n\n15\n\n6\n\n10\n\n4\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nw\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nl\n\nFigure 1: The thick red lines come from numerical evaluations of gT (w) and the most accurate\nform of gT (l) I was able to obtain.

In the present context, the quasi-normal modes in question are\nfluctuations which are purely infalling at the worldsheet horizon and behave as y 3 for small\ny. Such fluctuations occur at values of \u03c9 where CR (\u03c9) diverges. Equivalently, in terms\nof w = \u03c9zH /yS , the quasi-normal modes arise at poles of cR (w). A preliminary numerical\nanalysis yielded the following approximate values of the first two quasi-normal modes wn :\nw1 = 2.620 \u2212 2.302i\n\nw2 = 4.650 \u2212 4.316i .\n\n(71)\n\nFor each wn , \u2212wn\u2217 is also a quasi-normal frequency. (Quasi-normal modes of the trailing\n\nstring were also considered in [1] in the v \u2192 0 limit, although the boundary conditions were\n\ndifferent.) A standard expectation is that l1 \u2261 1/ Im w1 \u2248 0.44 sets a scale for exponential\n15\n\n\fdecay of the retarded Green's function. This is considerably smaller than l\u2217 ; note however\nthat l1 relates only to asymptotic statements at large l, whereas l\u2217 is an approximate characterization of the main structures visible in gT (l). (Also note that because | Im w1 | > 2, the\n\nsingularity of gT (w) in the complex w plane closest to the real axis is not w1 but \u00b12i coming\n\nfrom the factor coth(\u03c0w/2), so a decay gT (l) \u223c e\u22122|l| is expected rather than e\u2212|l|/l1 .)\n\n7\n\nDiscussion\n\nOne should be able to extract the transport coefficients \u03baL , \u03baT , q\u0302T , and q\u0302L from the lowfrequency limit of the symmetrized Wightman functions:\nv\n\u03baT = q\u0302T = lim GT (\u03c9)\n\u03c9\u21920\n2\n\n\u03baL = v q\u0302L = lim GL (\u03c9) .\n\u03c9\u21920\n\n(72)\n\nThe logic supporting (72) is a treatment of momentum diffusion as in equations (7)-(10),\nonly with stochastic averages replaced by the symmetrized Wightman functions. Using (66)\nand limw\u21920 gT (w) = 1, one finds the results quoted in (14):\n2\u03baT\nq\u0302T =\n= 2\u03c0\nv\n\nq\n\ngY2 M N\n\nT\n\n3\u221a\n\n\u03baL\nq\u0302L =\n=\u03c0\nv\n\n\u03b3/v\n\nq\ngY2 M N T 3 \u03b3 5/2 /v .\n\n(73)\n\nBecause of the dramatic failure of the Einstein relation (3), it doesn't make sense to plug\nthe trailing string predictions for \u03b7D , \u03baL , and \u03baT into a Langevin description of a finite\nmass quark: it won't equilibrate to a Maxwell-Boltzman distribution, due to the largeness\nof \u03baL as compared to \u03b7D at highly relativistic speeds. Perhaps what is needed is a stochastic\ntreatment of the quasi-normal modes of the trailing string, the lowest of whose frequencies\nwere found in (71).\nBecause strongly coupled N = 4 gauge theory is different in significant respects from\n\nQCD, there is considerable uncertainty in how one should translate results like (2) and (72)\ninto quantitative predictions for QCD. To characterize this uncertainty, consider the following\ntwo comparison schemes:\n\n\u2022 An \"obvious\" comparison scheme is to equate the temperature and the Yang-Mills\ncoupling. I will assume T = 250 MeV and \u03b1s = 0.5, which are in a representative\n\nrange for RHIC physics. To summarize:\n\"obvious\" scheme:\n\nTN =4 = TQCD = 250 MeV\n\n16\n\ngY2 M N = 12\u03c0\u03b1s = 6\u03c0 .\n\n(74)\n\n\f\u2022 An \"alternative\" comparison scheme was proposed in [34]. The first part of this pre-\n\nscription is to equate energy density instead of temperature. Thus in any formula (for\nexample (73)) in N = 4 into which T enters, one eliminates it in favor of a power\n\nof the energy density before comparing to QCD. This is approximately equivalent to\nsetting TN =4 = TQCD /31/4 . The second part of the prescription is to determine gY2 M N\nby matching string theory results for the force between a static quark and anti-quark\nto lattice results. This match is conspicuously imperfect, but at TQCD = 250 MeV a\nrange 3.5 < gY2 M N < 8 was found by comparing static potentials at r \u2248 0.25 fm, with\n\ngY2 M N = 5.5 suggested as a typical value. To summarize:\n\"alternative\" scheme:\n\n31/4 TN =4 = TQCD = 250 MeV\n\ngY2 M N = 5.5 .\n\n(75)\n\nCombining (73) with either (74) or (75) leads to the following estimates of q\u0302T for a charm\nquark propagating through a real QGP:\n\"obvious:\"\n\"alternative:\"\n\n1\nq\u0302T \u2248 (2.2 GeV2 /fm) \u221a\n= 5.9 GeV2 /fm\n4\nv 1 \u2212 v2\n1\n= 1.4 GeV2 /fm\nq\u0302T \u2248 (0.51 GeV2 /fm) \u221a\n4\n2\nv 1\u2212v\n\nfor pc = 10 GeV/c\nfor pc = 10 GeV/c,\n(76)\n\nand for q\u0302L :\n\"obvious:\"\n\"alternative:\"\n\n1\n= 150 GeV2 /fm\nv(1 \u2212 v 2 )5/4\n1\n= 36 GeV2 /fm\nq\u0302L \u2248 (0.26 GeV2 /fm)\nv(1 \u2212 v 2 )5/4\n\nq\u0302L \u2248 (1.1 GeV2 /fm)\n\nfor pc = 10 GeV/c\nfor pc = 10 GeV/c,\n(77)\n\nwhere I have set mc = 1.4 GeV. The choice pc = 10 GeV/c corresponds roughly to pT =\n5 GeV for non-photonic electrons.\n\nThe values of q\u0302T and q\u0302L scale with temperature as\n\n(TQCD /250 MeV)3 in both the \"obvious\" and \"alternative\" prescriptions. Based on the large\nvalues for q\u0302L in (77), especially using the \"obvious\" comparison prescription, a conservative\nconclusion is simply that longitudinal fluctuations in the force are strong and merit a more\nthorough investigation.\nThere appears to be some tension between the results of the present work and those\nof [5, 7]. We insert a color source in N = 4 gauge theory in the same way, namely by\n\nletting a fundamental string end on the boundary. This is why our results have the same\np\ngY2 M N scaling. But the functional dependence as well as the magnitude of our results\n17\n\n\fdiffer significantly: in [5, 7] it was found for partons in the adjoint representation that\nq\u0302LRW\n\n\u03c0 3/2 \u0393(3/4)\n=\n\u0393(5/4)\n\nq\n\ngY2 M N T 3\n\n(78)\n\nin the light-like limit, v \u2192 1. Combining (78) with either (74) or (75) leads to\n\"obvious:\"\n\"alternative:\"\n\nq\u0302LRW \u2248 2.6 GeV2 /fm\n2\n\n(79)\n\nq\u0302LRW \u2248 0.61 GeV /fm .\n\nAgain it is worth noting the sensitive dependence (TQCD /250 MeV)3 of q\u0302LRW . It is also\nimportant to recall that q\u0302LRW is defined differently from q\u0302T , in terms of a partially light-like\nWilson loop rather than momentum broadening.\nAs a consistency check on the comparison of q\u0302T to a transport quantity used in modeling\na real-world quark-gluon plasma, one should inquire whether the path lengths of real charm\nquarks are longer than the typical time scale t\u2217 of force-force correlators. An estimate of\nthis time scale can be read off from the quantity l\u2217 discussed following (69) as t\u2217 = l\u2217 zH /yS .\nCombining this with either (74) or (75) leads to\n\"obvious:\"\n\"alternative:\"\n\np\nt\u2217 = (1.0 fm/c) E/10 GeV\np\nt\u2217 = (1.3 fm/c) E/10 GeV .\n\n(80)\n\nClearly these times are short compared to the lifetime of the QGP, which is roughly 6 fm/c in\ncentral collisions. But it is more relevant to compare to the mean path length of the charm\nquarks which escape from the QGP and are detected. This is presumably bounded below\nby the corresponding quantity for hard partons without a flavor tag, estimated in [47] as\n\u03bbmean = 2.5 fm. Perhaps an even more relevant comparison is the relaxation time tD = 1/\u03b7D\nfor charm quarks as calculated via the trailing string picture. This quantity was estimated in\n[34] as tD = 0.6 fm/c using the \"obvious\" prescription and 2.1 fm/c using the \"alternative\"\nprescription. The comparison with tD is the most stringent:\n\"obvious:\"\n\"alternative:\"\n\np\nt\u2217\n= 1.7 E/10 GeV\ntD\np\nt\u2217\n= 0.63 E/10 GeV .\ntD\n\n(81)\n\nThe conclusion from (81) is that, depending somewhat on assumptions, time correlations in\n\n18\n\n\fthe fluctuating forces on a charm quark probably matter, especially at higher energies. It\nwould be useful to inquire what happens when the quark mass is made finite explicitly in\nthe string construction by inserting a flavor brane as in [48, 1].\nFor b quarks, whose mass is roughly 4.8 GeV, time correlations are less important for the\n\u221a\nenergies attainable at RHIC: t\u2217 scales as 1/ m while tD scales as m, so for fixed energy, the\nratio t\u2217 /tD is decreased by a factor of (mb /mc )3/2 \u2248 6.3.\n\nCorrelation times may also help clarify the relation with [5, 7]: t\u2217 diverges as v \u2192 1, so\n\nif the path length \u03bb is held fixed as this limit is taken, it conflicts strongly with the \u03c9 \u2192 0\n\nlimit in (72). It is tempting to speculate that somehow cutting off the integral (9) at finite\ntime would allow one to define a q\u0302-like quantity with a finite v \u2192 1 limit.\n\nA characteristic feature of radiative descriptions of energy loss following [39, 40, 41] is\n\nthe scaling of \u2206E not as path length \u03bb but as \u03bb2 . The Brodsky-Hoyer inequality [49],\n1\n\u2206E < q\u0302\u03bb2 ,\n2\n\n(82)\n\nderived from uncertainty principle considerations, is saturated to within a factor of order\nunity in the BDMPS formalism. This is in contrast to a Langevin description including\ndrag force, where \u2206E \u221d \u03bb. As a rough comparison between a radiative description and\n\nthe trailing string description, it is interesting to ask above what critical path-length \u03bbc the\n\ninequality (82) is satisfied if one extracts the left-hand side from the drag force (ignoring\nlongitudinal fluctuations in the force) and sets q\u0302 = q\u0302T . The answer is\n\u221a\nv2 \u03b3\nv2\n\u03bbc =\n=\n.\n2T\n2T yS\n\n(83)\n\nFor pc = 10 GeV, one finds \u03bbc = 1.0 fm using the \"obvious\" scheme and \u03bbc = 1.4 fm using the\n\"alternative\" scheme. In principle one can distinguish between predictions of radiative and\nLangevin descriptions of energy loss by making independent measurements of energy loss\nand momentum broadening. It has already been suggested [50] in the context of a Langevin\ndescription that two-point correlators in azimuthal angle for D-D\u0304 pairs could provide some\ninsight into the drag force. Further investigation of the potential uses of heavy quark twopoint correlators to distinguish between competing models of energy loss would clearly be of\ninterest.\nThe trailing string makes the distinctive prediction that, for heavy quarks, both the\n\u221a\naverage drag force and fluctuations are enhanced by powers of the Lorentz factor 1/ 1 \u2212 v 2\nfor v close to 1. This clearly implies that heavy quarks feel dissipative effects more strongly\n\n19\n\n\fwhen they are more energetic. So the expectation from the trailing string picture is that\nRAA as a function of pT for non-photonic electrons has a more negative slope than predicted\nby treatments such as [51] in which q\u0302 is held fixed (i.e. independent of pT ). It is therefore\ngratifying to observe in figure 3 of [33] a persistently negative slope of RAA over a wide\nrange of momenta, 1.5 GeV/c < pT < 7 GeV/c. The predictions of [51] include a weaker\ndependence of RAA on pT over this range.6 The predictions of [38] are also rather flat in this\ninterval, despite a dependence of \u03b7D (p) on p that is only slowly decreasing in the range of\ninterest. The predictions of [35], which, like [38], are based on a Langevin approach, have\na significantly larger momentum range in which RAA is strongly decreasing, and \u03b7D (p) as\npresented in the closely related work [37] is again slowly decreasing in the range of interest.\nOnly three points, with pT roughly between 4.8 and 6.5 GeV/c, lie below the predictions of\n[35]; the same three, plus perhaps one other at pT \u2248 4.2 GeV/c, lie below the predictions of\n\n[51]. In summary, the comparison of RAA as reported in [33] with existing phenomenological\nmodels reinforces the view that dissipative effects increase with the momentum of the heavy\n\nquark; but without some more systematic study, it is hard to tell whether the trailing string\npicture does a better job of explaining the data than other approaches.\nResults from the STAR collaboration [32] agree fairly well with [51] if the contribution\nfrom bottom quarks is removed. But in light of the comparisons of pp \u2192 eX PHENIX data\n[52] with fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log calculations [53], it seems ad hoc to neglect\n\nbottom contributions completely. The authors of [51] cogently warn of the difficulty of\ndisentangling the contributions of charm and bottom in the absence of vertex reconstruction.\nIn any case, the STAR data are at least consistent with a more negative slope for RAA as a\nfunction of pT than either the c + b or c only curves from [51].\n\n8\n\nVersion history\n\n\u221a\nIn the initial version of this work it was claimed incorrectly that q\u0302T scales as 1/ 1 \u2212 v 2\n\u221a\nas v \u2192 1. The correct scaling 1/ 4 1 \u2212 v 2 was worked out in private communications with\nJ. Casalderrey-Solana and D. Teaney, who independently obtained key aspects of the current\n\nwork. Subsequently and independently, they and I worked out the case of longitudinal\nfluctuations. The crucial correction to my original treatment of transverse fluctuations is the\n\u03c9\nreplacement coth 2T\n\u2192 coth 2T\u03c9yS in (39), as justified in appendix B following [45]. Inspired\n6\n\nIn referring to the predictions of one or another theoretical study, I am relying upon the portrayal of\nthose predictions in [33] or [32]. This means, in particular, a choice q\u0302 = 14 GeV2 /fm in the calculations of\n[51].\n\n20\n\n\fby their treatment, I realized that the Green's functions could be expressed as functions\nof w = \u03c9zH /yS up to overall powers of zH and yS . This facilitated an analysis of the\ncharacteristic time-scale of force correlations. It also occurred to me that a simple zerotemperature treatment sufficed to understand the leading behavior at large w of gT (w).\nFinally, in private communications, H. Liu, K. Rajagopal, and U. Wiedemann all urged me\nto distinguish even more carefully between q\u0302 as computed through a Wilson loop formalism\nand q\u0302T \u2261 hp2\u22a5 i/\u03bb. Taken together, these developments seemed an appropriate occasion for\nthe substantial rewrite that occurred between arXiv versions 2 and 3.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI thank C. Herzog, H. Liu, J.

Actually, I will do somewhat\n\nmore by explicitly constructing coordinates in which the worldsheet metric is seen to be\nlocally conformal to R1,1 (as any two-dimensional metric with \u2212+ signature must be).\n\nIt is convenient to start by parametrizing the worldsheet using x1 and y rather than t\n\nand y.

The manipulations to cast the metric (84) in a conformally flat\n\nform are relatively simple because g\u03b1\u03b2 depends on y but not x1 :\nds22\n\nwhere\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u00132\ny 4 /v 2\nL2\nh\nzH y 2 /v\nL2\n2\n1\ndy + 2 2 1 \u2212 2\ndx \u2212\ndy\n= 2 1\u2212\ny\n1 \u2212 h/v 2\nzH y\nv\n1 \u2212 h/v 2\nL2\nL2 1 \u2212 v 2 2\ndy\n\u2212\n(h \u2212 v 2 )dq 2\n= 2\n2 2\ny h \u2212 v2\nv 2 zH\ny\n\u0001\n= \u03a92 \u2212dq 2 + d\u03b7 2\n\u03a92 =\n\nL2 h \u2212 v 2\n2\ny 2 v 2 zH\n\n(85)\n\n(86)\n\nand I have defined new coordinates\n1\n\nq=x +\n\nZ\n\nzH y 2v\ndy\nh \u2212 v2\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b7 = \u00b1vzH 1 \u2212\n\nv2\n\nZ\n\ndy\n.\nh \u2212 v2\n\n(87)\n\nBecause h \u2212 v 2 = yS4 \u2212 y 4 , the integrals in (87) diverge at the horizon.

In region I (outside the horizon) y is the spacelike variable and q is the timelike\nvariable. In region II (inside the horizon) y is timelike and q is spacelike.\nUsing x1 = vt + \u03be(y), one may extract expressions for qI in terms of t and y rather than\nx1 and y; \u03b7I , on the other hand, is a function only of y. To construct infalling and outgoing\ncoordinates in region I, one simply forms\nq\u00b1 = qI \u00b1 \u03b7I .\nExpanding in small yS \u2212 y, one finds\nq\u2212 = vt + . . .\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nzH\nq+ = v t \u2212\nlog(yS \u2212 y) + . . . ,\n2yS\n\n(90)\n\n(91)\n\nwhere the omitted terms comprise constant terms (i.e. independent of t and y) and terms\ninvolving positive powers of yS \u2212 y. Up to the overall factor of v, the expressions in (91) are\n\nprecisely the ones given in (30).\n\nB\n\nRelations between real-time thermal propagators\n\nThe usual relations among the Green's functions defined in (32) may be summarized as\nfollows:7\n\n\u03c9\nIm GR (\u03c9)\n2T\n\u03c9\nG(\u03c9) = \u2212 Im GF (\u03c9) = \u2212 coth\nIm GR (\u03c9) .\n2T\nGF (\u03c9) = Re GR (\u03c9) + i coth\n\n(92)\n\nThe first equality in (92) usually can be derived by inserting complete sets of states; the\nsecond is immediate from the definitions; and the third is an obvious corollary of the first.\nHowever, the usual derivation of the first equality relies crucially on having a fully equilibrated system, where hQi = tr(e\u2212\u03b2H Q)/ tr e\u2212\u03b2H for any operator Q, and the heavy quark\n\nis far from equilibrated. It turns out that a very simple modification of (92) suffices: one\n7\n\nI am indebted to J. Casalderrey-Solana and D. Teaney for pointing out that the second equality in\nequation (25) of the original version of this paper was in error, and for private communications related to\nthe contents of this appendix. The treatment in this appendix follows in its essential points that of [45].\n\n23\n\n\fmust make the replacement T \u2192 T yS in (92), where yS =\n\n\u221a\n4\n\n1 \u2212 v 2 . This applies equally for\n\ntransverse and longitudinal fluctuations, and I will not need to distinguish between them in\nthis appendix.\nA derivation of the modified form of (92) may be carried out using the Schwinger-Keldysh\nformalism, as adapted to AdS/CFT in [54] following earlier work [55, 56, 57]. For simplicity,\nlet's set zH = 1, so T = 1/\u03c0. First define Kruskal coordinates U and V such that\nUV =\n\ny \u2212 1 \u22122 tan\u22121 y\ne\ny+1\n\nV\n= \u2212e4t .\nU\n\n(93)\n\nTo make the most efficient use of these relations, it helps to note the following points:\n1. One may extend the second relation in (93) over the entire Penrose diagram by assigning t an imaginary part which is piecewise constant but changes by an odd-integer\nmultiple of i\u03c0/4 as U or V switches sign. A consistent way of doing so is exhibited in\nfigure 2a.\n2. The first relation in (93) defines a monotonically increasing map from UV \u2208 (\u22121, e\u2212\u03c0 )\nto y \u2208 (0, \u221e), and UV = 0 maps to y = 1.\n\n3. As a result of the previous two points, the relations (93) define a one-to-one map\n(U, V ) \u2192 (t, y), where the domain of (U, V ) is points in R2 subject only to the restric-\n\ntion \u22121 < UV < e\u2212\u03c0 , and the range of (t, y) has four disjoint pieces corresponding to\n\nthe four regions (RFLP) in figure 2a. The R piece, for example, comprises points in\nR2 subject only to the restriction 0 < y < 1.\nThe trailing string solution (17) may be recast in the form\nx1 =\n\nv\nlog V + v tan\u22121 y .\n2\n\n(94)\n\n(Recall that zH = 1.) In this form it is clear that the trailing string is entirely non-singular\nat the horizon between the R and F regions. The singularity at V = 0, corresponding to\nRe t \u2192 \u2212\u221e, is genuine. In the spirit of the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, one prepares a\n\nstate of the system at Re t = \u2212\u221e and propagates it first forward along Im t = 0 and then\nback along Im t = \u2212\u03c0/2. Correspondingly, one may use (94) in the R and F regions and\nx1 =\n\nv\nlog(\u2212V ) + v tan\u22121 y \u2212 iv\u03c0/2\n2\n\n(95)\n\nin the L and P regions.

Increasing the real part of t corresponds to moving upward on the R boundary\nand downward on the L boundary. Increasing y means moving to the left in R and to\nthe right in L. (B) The odd-numbered regions are narrow slices of the Penrose diagram\ncorresponding to series expansions around y = 0, yS , and 1. The even-numbered regions fill\nin between these series expansions. Note that 3 and 3\u0303 are disjoint, but 5 is a subset of 5\u0303. The\ncorresponding regions \u22121 to \u22126 are the reflections of 1 to 6 through the point U = V = 0.\ncontinuing V through the lower half-plane-that is, for Im V slightly negative. Such a\ncontinuation is consistent with the conventions laid out in figure 2 because in the L region\none may rewrite (95) in terms of t and y in precisely the original form (17).\nLet's now consider perturbation wave-functions \u03a8\u03b1 for oscillations of the string in a\nslightly more general fashion than in section 3. The index \u03b1 will run over values in a rather\nlarge set:\n\u03b1 \u2208 {\u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b13, \u00b13\u0303, \u00b14, \u00b15, \u00b15\u0303, \u00b16} .\n\n(96)\n\nThese values correspond to different regions of the Penrose diagram, as indicated in figure 2b.\nIn each of the odd-numbered regions, which are all narrow slices near some definite value\nof y, one may expand the general solution to the wave equation for \u03a8 to leading order as\n\n25\n\n\ffollows:\n\u03a81 = [A1 + B1 y 3 ]e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n\u03a8\u22121 = [A\u22121 + B\u22121 y 3]e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n\u03a83 = [A3 + B3 (yS \u2212 y)i\u03c9/2yS ]e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n\u03a8\u22123 = [A\u22123 + B\u22123 (yS \u2212 y)i\u03c9/2yS ]e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n\u03a83\u0303 = [A3\u0303 + B3\u0303 (y \u2212 yS )i\u03c9/2yS ]e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n\u03a8\u22123\u0303 = [A\u22123\u0303 + B\u22123\u0303 (y \u2212 yS )i\u03c9/2yS ]e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n\u03a85 = [A5 + B5 (1 \u2212 y)](1 \u2212 y)\u2212i\u03c9/4 e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n\u03a8\u22125 = [A\u22125 + B\u22125 (1 \u2212 y)](1 \u2212 y)\u2212i\u03c9/4 e\u2212i\u03c9t\n\n\u03a85\u0303 = [A5\u0303 + B5\u0303 (1 \u2212 y)]V \u2212i\u03c9/2\n\n\u03a8\u22125\u0303 = [A\u22125\u0303 + B\u22125\u0303 (1 \u2212 y)](\u2212V )\u2212i\u03c9/2 .\n\n(97)\n\nFor brevity I have dropped subleading terms from the A-type solutions in (97) even when\nthey are bigger than the B-type solutions. There is no loss of generality in assuming e\u2212i\u03c9t\ndependence because the entire spacetime has a timelike Killing vector which is \u2202/\u2202t in each\npatch.\nThe expressions in (97) involve imaginary powers of quantities which are real and positive.\nSuch expressions are unambiguously defined: xi\u03b1 \u2261 ei\u03b1 log x . To specify \u03a8 globally one must\n\nprescribe via some analytic continuation how the pairs (\u03a83 , \u03a83\u0303 ), (\u03a8\u22123 , \u03a8\u22123\u0303), and (\u03a85\u0303 , \u03a8\u22125\u0303 )\n\nfit together. Also one must solve the wave equation for \u03a8 in the intermediate regions \u00b12,\n\u00b14, either through some approximation or via numerics.8 The result of such prescriptions\n\nand approximate solutions can be cast in terms of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices:\n~v\u03b1 = M\u03b1\u03b2 ~v\u03b2\n\nwhere ~v\u03b1 =\n\nA\u03b1\nB\u03b1\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(98)\n\nHere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are in the set (96), excluding the even numbered values. Note that M\u03b1\u03b2 for\neach \u03b1 and \u03b2 is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix: \u03b1 and \u03b2 label the matrix, not its components. An obvious\n\nproperty of the M\u03b1\u03b2 is M\u03b2\u03b1 = M\u22121\n\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\nThe properties of the matrices M\u03b1\u03b2 that I will require are:\nM\u22121,\u22123 = M13\n\nM33\u0303 =\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0 e\u2212\u03c0\u03c9/2yS\n\n(99)\n\nM\u22123\u0303,\u22125 = M3\u03035\n\n!\n\nM\u22123,\u22123\u0303 =\n\n8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0 e\u03c0\u03c9/2yS\n\n!\n\n(100)\n\nOne could also find numerical solutions in region \u00b16 and perhaps match to some expansion near the\nfuture and past spacelike singularities.

Comparing with (60), one sees immediately that\nGF (\u03c9) = Re GR (\u03c9) + i coth\n\n\u03c0\u03c9\nIm GR (\u03c9) .\n2yS\n\n(108)\n\nRestoring factors of zH amounts to replacing \u03c0 by 1/T in (108), so this is the desired\nmodification of the first equation in (92).\nNow let's return to the justification of the formulas (99)-(103). The main issue is continuing from \u03a8\u00b13 to \u03a8\u00b13\u0303 and from \u03a85\u0303 to \u03a8\u22125\u0303 . An argument was made in [54], and extended\nto the present context in [45], that the correct way to do this is to continue in the lower\nhalf of the complex V plane and the upper half of the complex U plane when horizon singularities are encountered. By so doing one imposes infalling conditions on positive frequency\nmodes and outgoing conditions on negative frequency modes. Formally one may simply send\nU \u2192 U +i\u03b4 and V \u2192 V \u2212i\u03b4 for small positive \u03b4. In R this corresponds to sending y \u2192 y +i\u03b4,\n\nand in L it corresponds to sending y \u2192 y \u2212 i\u03b4. Consider the consequences for matching the\noscillatory solution from 3 to 3\u0303, which takes place wholly within the R region:\nlim B3 (yS \u2212 y \u2212 i\u03b4)i\u03c9/2yS = lim B3\u0303 (y \u2212 yS + i\u03b4)i\u03c9/2yS ,\n\ny\u2192yS \u2212\n\ny\u2192yS +\n\n(109)\n\nwhere the first limit is from below and the second is from above. From (109) one obtains\nB3 = e\u2212\u03c0\u03c9/2yS B3\u0303 , whence the lower right entry in M33\u0303 . The opposite behavior arises in\nM\u22123,\u22123\u0303 because y \u2192 y \u2212 i\u03b4 in the L region. In crossing the V = 0 line, one finds (V \u2212\ni\u03b4)\u2212i\u03c9/2 = e\u2212\u03c0\u03c9/2 (\u2212V + i\u03b4)\u2212i\u03c9/2 . This completes a justification of (100) and (102). The\nother steps can be justified more straightforwardly, as follows:\n\u2022 (99) is a consequence of the wave equation for \u03a8 being the same in regions \u00b12 and \u00b14.\nThe non-zero imaginary part of t doesn't affect the equation of motion.\n\n\u2022 (101) is a consequence of applying the rule xi\u03b1 = ei\u03b1 log x only when x is positive. The\n\ndetails are somewhat intricate, so I will trace the steps for the A-type solution from\n\u22125 to \u22125\u0303:\nA\u22125 (1 \u2212 y)\u2212i\u03c9/4 e\u2212i\u03c9t = A\u22125 (1 \u2212 y)\u2212i\u03c9/4 e\u2212i\u03c9 Re t e\u2212\u03c0\u03c9/2\n\u0012 \u2212\u03c0/2 \u0013i\u03c9/4\ne\n\u2212i\u03c9/2\n= A\u22125 (\u2212V )\ne\u2212\u03c0\u03c9/2 = A\u22125\u0303 (\u2212V )\u2212i\u03c9/2 ,\n2\n\n(110)\n\nwhere in the second equality I used the leading behavior of V near y = 1 in the L\n\n28\n\n\fregion:\n(\u2212V )2 = (1 \u2212 y)e4t\n\ne\u2212\u03c0/2\ne\u2212\u03c0/2\n= (1 \u2212 y)e4 Re t\n.\n2\n2\n\n(111)\n\nThe first and last expressions in (111) are in a form suitable to be raised to the imaginary power \u2212i\u03c9/4.\n\u2022 (103) is a consequence of the behavior of purely infalling and purely outgoing solutions\n\nof the wave equation for \u03a8. An infalling solution is one with B3 = 0, and its behavior\nf 13 .\nthe R boundary, (28), corresponds to ~v1 given by the first column of the matrix M\n\nAn outgoing solution should have behavior at the R boundary corresponding to ~v1\nf 13 . It so happens that if \u03a8R (\u03c9, t, y) = e\u2212i\u03c9t \u03c8R (\u03c9, y)\ngiven by the second column of M\nis the infalling wave-function constructed in section 3, then\n\n\u03a8A (\u03c9, t, y) = e\u2212i\u03c9t f (y)i\u03c9/2f (y/yS )\u2212i\u03c9/2yS \u03c8R (\u03c9, y)\u2217\n\n(112)\n\nis a purely outgoing solution, where\nf (y) \u2261\n\n1 + y \u22122 tan\u22121 y\ne\n.\n1\u2212y\n\n(113)\n\nExpanding (112) for small y gives\n\u03a8A (\u03c9, t, y) = [1 + (CR (\u03c9)\u2217 \u2212 iX)y 3]e\u2212i\u03c9t ,\n\n(114)\n\nas desired.\n\nC\n\nSpeed limits on single quarks\n\nThe string theory calculations presented in this paper pertain to external quarks: pointlike\nobjects in the fundamental representation which have infinite mass associated with their\nnear-field Coulombic color-electric field. Comparisons with QCD are thus better justified for\nc and b quarks, whose mass is well above the typical temperature of the QGP, than for light\nquarks.\nIf the velocity of an external quark is too close to unity, there is a new reason to be\nwary of trailing string computations: the horizon on the worldsheet is very close to the\nboundary, where in a holographic representation of real QCD (assuming there is one) space\npresumably becomes highly curved, and the simplest calculations based on the Nambu-Goto\n\n29\n\n\faction in AdS5 -Schwarzschild may experience significant corrections. Let's try to estimate\nwhen problems of this sort might start to arise. It was suggested already in [24] to associate\nan energy scale\nL2 /zH 1\nT\n\u03bc=\n=\n\u2032\n2\u03c0\u03b1 y\n2\n\np\ngY2 M N\ny\n\n(115)\n\nwith a radius y in AdS5 -Schwarzschild. This is justified by observing that a static string\ndangling from y into the horizon has mass\nmstatic\n\nL2 /zH\n=\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u22121\ny\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2248\u03bc\n\nfor y \u226a 1.\n\n(116)\n\nNow suppose one identifies a scale \u03bcfail at which AdS/CFT techniques (at least those based\non supergravity and classical strings) start to fail. From (115) one extracts a corresponding\nyfail , and if the worldsheet horizon has yS < yfail there may be significant corrections to the\ntrailing string results. Setting yS = yfail and using (23), one finds that the Lorentz factor of\nthe heavy quark that the trailing string purports to describe is\n\u03b3fail =\n\n4\ngY2 M N\n\n\u0010\u03bc\n\nfail\n\nT\n\n\u00112\n\n.\n\n(117)\n\nThe trouble with (117) is that gY2 M N, \u03bcfail and T all incorporate considerable uncertainties.\nTo get an idea of the range of plausible values for \u03b3fail , let's consider the two prescriptions\n(74) and (75). I don't have a systematic way of determining \u03bcfail, but perhaps a reasonable\nrange to consider is \u03bcfail = 0.8 \u2212 1.6 GeV. Taking \u03bcfail = 1.2 GeV as a representative value,\none finds\n\n\"obvious:\"\n\"alternative:\"\n\n\u0010 \u03bc\n\u00112\nfail\n\u03b3fail = 4.9\n1.2 GeV\n\u0010 \u03bc\n\u00112\nfail\n\u03b3fail = 29\n.\n1.2 GeV\n\n(118)\n\nBecause of the quadratic dependence on both \u03bcfail and T (not to mention the choice of\ncomparison scheme) \u03b3fail remains substantially uncertain. Evidently, if the \"obvious\" prescription is used, there is some doubt cast on stringy predictions for charm quark when\npc >\n\u223c 6.7 GeV/c, corresponding to pT >\n\u223c 3.4 GeV. In the \"alternative\" scheme, there is less\n\nreason to worry about stringy corrections near the upper end of the trailing string.\n\nAnother thing can go wrong if one wants to represent a finite mass quark as a string\nending on a D7-brane, as in [48, 1]. Given mc for the charm quark, one can use (116) to\n\n30\n\n\fobtain a corresponding position\nyc =\n\n1\n1 + 2mc /T\n\np\ngY2 M N\n\n(119)\n\nof the D7-brane. If yS < yc , then there is no horizon on the trailing string: the boundary\nof the worldsheet is spacelike. I regard this as a pathology which probably invalidates the\ntrailing string picture for Lorentz factors \u03b3 > \u03b3c \u2261 1/yc2. Estimates of \u03b3c suffer from the\nsame ambiguities as \u03b3fail , as discussed above. Using mc = 1.4 GeV and either (74) or (75),\n\none arrives at the estimates\n\"obvious:\"\n\n\u03b3c = 13\n\n\"alternative:\"\n\n\u03b3c = 53 .\n\n(120)\n\nThese values should again be regarded as incorporating considerable uncertainties: for example, it is puzzling that the horizon causes the mass of a quark to decrease from its zerotemperature value, but this decrease is what makes the values in (120) higher than those\nderived from (118) with \u03bcfail \u2192 mc . The main lesson to draw from (120) is that charm's\n\nmass is high enough to avoid threatening the existence of the worldsheet horizon for the\nmomenta accessible at RHIC; but attempts to treat light quarks in terms of the trailing\nstring construction are perilous indeed.9\n\n9\n\nFor example, in the \"alternative\" comparison scheme, an up quark whose mass in the medium is assumed\nto be m = 300 MeV would be described in terms of a D7-brane with yu = 0.43, so \u03b3u = 5.5 is the maximum\nLorentz factor. It is hardly fair to ignore corrections to relativistic dispersion relations in this context, but\nif one does so, the result is a total energy of 1.7 GeV. As an upper limit on allowed energies for partons\ndescribed by trailing strings, this is fairly anemic.\n\n31\n\n\fReferences\n[1] C. P. Herzog, A. Karch, P. Kovtun, C. Kozcaz, and L. G.
