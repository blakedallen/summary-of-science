If dark energy is a manifestation of modified gravity on large scales, gravitational waves from cosmologicallydistant spacetime sirens are direct probes of this new physics. For example, a\ngravitational Hubble diagram based on black hole pair luminosity distances and\nhost galaxy redshifts could reveal a large distance extra-dimensional leakage of\ngravity. Various additional signatures may be expected in a gravitational signal\npropagated over cosmological scales.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEvidence for an accelerating expansion of the Universe is getting stronger. A measurable dimming of distant type Ia supernovae (e.g., Astier et al. 2006; Riess et al. 2007;\nWood-Vasey et al. 2007), CMB data (e.g., Spergel et al. 2007) and additional cosmological\nprobes (e.g., Wright 2007) indicate that a repulsive \"dark energy\" comprises 73% of the\nUniverse's content. Characterizing the properties of dark energy and uncovering its physical\nnature are two of the most important goals of modern cosmology. Current observational\nstrategies include tests of the possibility that dark energy arises from a failure of general\nrelativity on cosmological scales (Albrecht et al. 2006).\nEssentially all astronomical measurements are performed via electromagnetic waves.\nThe availability of accurate gravitational wave measurements, within the next decade or so,\nwill thus be a significant development. In particular, since the propagation of photons and\ngravitons could differ at a fundamental level, we argue here that gravitational waves emitted\nby cosmologically-distant \"space-time sirens,\" such as coalescing pairs of massive black holes,\nmay be used as valuable alternative probes of dark energy physics.\n1\n\nAPC UMR 7164 (CNRS, Univ. Paris 7, CEA, Obs. de Paris) & GReCO/IAP UMR 7095 (CNRS, Univ.\nParis 6) Paris, France\n2\n\nDepartment of Astronomy, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027, USA\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n6\nBlack holes with masses >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 are present at the center of numerous nearby galaxies\n(e.g. Kormendy & Richstone 1995; Magorrian et al. 1998). As such galaxies collide over\n58\ncosmic times, their central black holes coalesce, releasing >\n\u223c 10 ergs of binding energy in\nthe form of gravitational waves (hereafter GWs). To measure the GWs emitted by these\ncosmologically-distant space-time sirens, ESA and NASA will build the Laser Interferometer\nSpace Antenna, LISA1 .\n\n2.\n\nGravitational Measurements\n\nGWs emitted by black hole binaries have the unusual property of providing a direct\nmeasure of the luminosity distance, DL , to the black holes, without extrinsic calibration.\nOwing to the highly coherent nature of GW emission (Schulz 1986), the amplitude (or\nstrain), h+\u00d7 , frequency, f , and frequency derivative, f \u0307, of the leading order (quadrupolar)\nGW inspiral signal scale as\n[(1 + z)Mc ]5/3 f 2/3\n,\nDL\nf \u0307(t) \u221d [(1 + z)Mc ]5/3 f 11/3 ,\n\nh+\u00d7 (t) \u221d\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere +\u00d7 represents the two transverse GW polarizations, Mc = (m1 m2 )3/5 /(m1 + m2 )1/5\nis the black hole pair \"chirp\" mass and z its redshift. Provided the GW source can be\nreasonably well localized on the sky, an extended observation of the chirping signal leads\nto precise measurements of h+\u00d7 , f , f \u0307 and thus DL , independently. LISA's orbital configuration allows for a \"triangulation\" of GW sources on the sky to within a solid angle\n\u03b4\u03a9 \u223c 1 deg2 (Cutler 1998; Vecchio 2004), thus providing very accurate distance measurements, with \u03b4DL /DL < 1% at z <\n\u223c 2 typically (Cutler 1998; Hughes 2002; Vecchio 2004;\nLang & Hughes 2006).\nRecently, the possibility of identifying the individual host galaxy in which a pair of merging black holes seen by LISA is to be found has been explored in some detail (Holz & Hughes\n2005; Kocsis et al. 2006, 2007). Prospects for such identifications at redshifts z <\n\u223c 3 are good\nand identifications out to z \u223c 5-7 may even be possible in some cases (Kocsis et al. 2007).\nA unique host galaxy identification can be achieved through coordinated observations with\ntraditional telescopes, either to survey the LISA-triangulated area for unusual galactic properties or central activity after the coalescence, or by monitoring in real time the sky area for\n1\n\nhttp://lisa.nasa.gov/\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n53\nunusual electromagnetic emission, as the coalescence proceeds. Typically >\n\u223c 10 ergs of kinetic energy are delivered to the recoiling black hole remnant (e.g., Schnittman & Buonanno\n2007, and references therein) and its environment. The disturbed gas surrounding coalescing\nblack holes could thus power bright electromagnetic emission during and after coalescence\n(Armitage & Natarajan 2002; Milosavljevic & Phinney 2005; Dotti et al. 2006), permitting\nthe coincident identification of a unique host galaxy.\n\n3.\n\nGravitational Hubble Diagram\n\nA consequence of successfully identifying the host galaxies of coalescing black hole pairs\nis the possibility to draw a gravitational Hubble diagram, i.e. one that relates the gravitational luminosity distances, DL , of space-time sirens to the electromagnetic redshifts, z, of\ntheir host galaxies.\nThe solid line in Fig. 1 shows a model fit to a Hubble diagram from a recent type Ia\nsupernova sample with a dark energy equation of state P/\u03c1 \u2261 w = \u22121.05 \u00b10.3 (at 3\u03c3, shown\nby the shaded region). Luminosity distances are expressed in terms of the usual distance\nmodulus, \u03bc = 5 log10 (DL / 1 Mpc) + 25. The individual supernova data points of the gold\nsample of Riess et al. (2007) are also shown. A flat universe with H0 = 72 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\nand a matter density \u03a9m = 0.27 is assumed.\nThe general interest of a gravitational Hubble diagram can be illustrated by considering\nalternative explanations for the apparent dimming of distant type Ia supernovae. If this\ndimming were caused by dust attenuation, photon-axion conversions or an intrinsic evolution\nof the supernova population (e.g., Cs\u00e1ki et al. 2002; Mirizzi et al. 2006; Robaina & Cepa\n2007), rather than stretched distances, this would become apparent in comparisons between\ngravitational and electromagnetic Hubble diagrams. Indeed, in each of these alternative\ndimming scenarios, photon- and graviton-based Hubble diagrams would be fundamentally\ndiscrepant since self-calibrated gravitational distance measurements are not susceptible to\nany significant bias from absorption, scattering, reddening, or axion-conversion.\nIn practice, however, the value of such a comparison is limited by line-of-sight matter\ninhomogeneities, which generate \"weak lensing\" uncertainties on any photon or graviton\nDL measurement (Holz & Hughes 2005; Kocsis et al. 2006; Dalal et al. 2006). While the\nlensing effect can be averaged out over the many random lines-of-sights available with the\nsupernova data (i.e., data points in Fig. 1), it may not be the case for coalescing black hole\npairs if LISA merger event rates are modest (e.g., a few tens per year at z <\n\u223c 5; Menou et al.\n2001; Wyithe & Loeb 2003; Sesana et al. 2004; Micic et al. 2007). Weak lensing errors on\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nindividual measurements amount to distance uncertainties ranging from \u03b4DL /DL \u2243 1% at\nz = 0.5 to \u03b4DL /DL \u2243 10% at z = 5 (e.g. Kocsis et al. 2006). The corresponding 3\u03c3 distance\nmodulus uncertainties exceed the 3\u03c3 confidence contours on the current dark energy model\nfit (shaded region in Fig. 1) at z >\n\u223c 0.7, which makes comparisons between photon- and\ngraviton-based Hubble diagrams imprecise even at moderate redshifts. The extent to which\nLISA events can be used to perform meaningful comparisons with photon-based Hubble\ndiagrams will thus depend strongly on the actual distribution of massive black hole merger\nevents with redshifts and the corresponding efficiency of host galaxy identifications.\n\n4.\n\nModified Gravity\n\nThe greatest prospect for dark energy science with gravitational waves may lie in exploring new physics on cosmological scales. The possibility that accelerated expansion results\nfrom a failure of general relativity has fueled much theoretical work on large scale modifications of gravity over the past few years. Since building a satisfactory theory of modified\nrelativistic gravity is a formidable task, any insight that can be gained from direct observational constraints on the linearized gravitational wave regime cannot be overlooked.\nOne may expect gravity modifications to contain a new length scale, let us call it Rc ,\nbeyond which gravity deviates from general relativity. In order to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe, this scale is expected to be of the order of the current\nHubble radius H0\u22121 . Modified gravity must also pass standard tests of general relativity on\nscales much shorter than Rc , e.g. in the solar system and in the strong field regime of binary\npulsars. An existence proof of modifications of this type is given by DGP gravity (Dvali et al.\n2000), a braneworld model with an infinite (possibly many) extra dimension. In this model,\nwhich also leads to an accelerated expansion of the Universe (Deffayet 2001; Deffayet et al.\n2002a), gravity is intrinsically higher dimensional2 . To leading order, the gravitational potential has the standard 1/D behavior at distances D smaller than Rc , while it behaves\n5-dimensionally at larger distances (1/D 2 ). Moreover, the stronger the gravitational field,\nthe closer the theory is to general relativity. As a consequence the model passes the PPN\ntests in the solar system, with possible deviations emerging in upcoming generations of solar system measurements (Lue & Starkman 2003; Dvali et al. 2003). The GW emission of\nclassical astrophysical sources is also expected to closely match that of general relativity. It\nis only at very large distances and low curvature that gravity is beginning to \"leak\" in the\n2\n\nGorbunov et al. (2006), Charmousis et al. (2006), Deffayet et al. (2006), Dvali (2006) Izumi et al. (2007)\nand Gregory et al. (2007) discuss the stability of the DGP self-accelerating phase.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nextra dimension.\nA previously unexplored consequence of extra-dimensional leakage is that cosmologicallydistant GW sources would appear dimmer than they truly are, from the loss of GW energy\nflux to the bulk. Inspired by this idea, we investigate here the consequences of this possible\nmodification of gravity, borrowing from the DGP model the notion that strong field gravity (and hence GW emission) asymptotes to general relativity, while deviations appear at\nvery large, typically cosmological distances, in the weak field regime. We will not deal here\nspecifically with GWs in the DGP model, which is the subject of a separate study, rather,\nwe illustrate more generally how a gravitational observatory such as LISA may reveal cosmological deviations in the weak field graviton propagator.\nIn the presence of large distance leakage (say at distances much larger than Rc ), flux\nconservation over a source-centered hypersphere requires that the GW amplitude scales with\ndistance D from the source as\nh+\u00d7 \u221d D \u2212(dim\u22122)/2 ,\n(3)\nwhere dim is the total number of space-time dimensions accessible to gravity modes. Thus,\nfor dim \u2265 5, it deviates from the usual h+\u00d7 (D) \u221d 1/D scaling. The scaling in Eq. (3)\nis consistent with explicit GW calculations in spacetimes with compact extra-dimensions\n(Cardoso et al. 2003; Barvinsky & Solodukhin 2003) and also applies to models where extra\ndimensions open up only at large distances (Gregory et al. 2000; Dvali et al. 2000, 2001).\nThe top three lines in Fig. 1 show gravitational Hubble diagrams, i.e. the expected locus\nof DL and z measurements from black hole pairs and host galaxies, in three simple scenarios\nwith dim = 5 and leakage beyond a scale Rc obeying Eq. (3). To allow arbitrary possibilities\nfor the transition at the cross-over scale, we adopt h+\u00d7 (DL ) \u221d (DL [1 + (DL /Rc )n/2 ]1/n )\u22121 ,\nwhere n determines the transition steepness. In the three cases shown, cross-over scales of a\nfew Hubble distances, Rc = 1-4 DH \u223c 2-9 Gpc were used and values n = 1 or 10 (\"steep\")\nfor the transition steepness were adopted. Error bars show the magnitude of 1\u03c3 weak lensing\nuncertainties on DL measurements due to line-of-sight matter inhomogeneities.\nThe electromagnetic Hubble diagrams of each scenario is assumed to mimic the cosmology of a w = \u22121 dark energy model (solid line), as expected if these scenarios produce an\naccelerated background cosmological FLRW space-time which affects the geodesic motion\nof photons in the standard way. As a result of the different propagation of GWs and large\ndistance leakage of GW energy flux, however, measured GW amplitudes, h+\u00d7 , are reduced\nand gravitational DL values are overestimated (Eqs. [1]\u2013[2]) for sources beyond the cross-over\nscale in these scenarios. The corresponding graviton Hubble diagrams would thus deviate\nfrom the electromagnetic version (solid line) since all photon-based measurements are standard, by construction. The discrepancy between the graviton-measured and photon-inferred\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nDL values could be of order unity even at moderate redshifts. Black hole merger events and\nassociated host galaxies may thus reveal the leakage of gravity with cross-over scales Rc \u223c a\nfew Hubble distances.\nDiagnostics based exclusively on electromagnetic measurements cannot reveal gravitational leakage directly, although they may do so indirectly (e.g., Lue & Starkman 2004;\nWang et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2007). Importantly, the leakage may be equally difficult to\nidentify with only a GW signal. As is well known, all the mass combinations that determine\nthe GW signal, e.g. in post-Newtonian expansions of the inspiral signal, are redshifted by\na factor 1 + z and thus degenerate with redshift (e.g., Hughes 2002). Provided that general\nrelativistic black holes and GW emission are accurately recovered on sub-cosmological scales\nin the modified gravity scenarios considered, leakage on cosmological scales would lead to\na hidden bias on the redshift (overestimated) and black hole masses (underestimated), as\ninferred from adopting a background cosmology that ignores leakage altogether. Only if the\nredshift of the host galaxy were to become available would the discrepancy with the gravitational measurement become apparent, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Paradoxically, this could\nlimit our abilities to identify the host galaxy of a merging black hole pair, by invalidating\nsearch strategies that rely on a (biased) value of the gravitational luminosity distance to\ndefine redshift cuts on potential host galaxies (Kocsis et al. 2006).\nWe note that evidence of GW leakage could also emerge in different contexts, e.g. from\nlow redshift short gamma-ray bursts detected by a network of ground-based GW detectors\n(Dalal et al. 2006), or from an unexpectedly low amplitude of the present-day GW background relative to its CMB-normalized value (A. Buonanno, priv. communication).\nDespite the strong GW leakage suggested by the above energetic arguments, one should\nbe very cautious in evaluating the significance of the deviations shown in Fig. 1. Indeed,\nEq. (3) says very little about the cross-over transition physics and other details of GW\npropagation on cosmological scales. In particular, even though the scaling given in Eq. (3)\ndoes apply to the DGP model, the \"infrared transparency\" effect (Dvali et al. 2001) can be\nshown to result in a considerable increase of the distance at which GW leakage is manifested\nin DGP, reaching scales much beyond Rc for sources with frequencies relevant to LISA\n(Deffayet et al. 2007). Therefore, the DGP model does not necessarily produce significant\ndeviations between gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity distances and it would, in\nfact, be difficult to distinguish from general relativity on the basis of the test illustrated in\nFig. 1. On the other hand, since it is presently unclear whether infrared transparency and\nits consequences for GW propagation are generic to all cases of higher-dimensional gravity\nwith large distance leakage (in particular when Lorentz symmetry is broken), Fig. 1 remains\nuseful in providing a good measure of potential GW leakage.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n5.\n\nAdditional Signatures\n\nLarge distance leakage is only one of several possible modified gravity signatures in\nthe GW signal from cosmologically-distant spacetime sirens. We discuss a few additional\npossibilities here, voluntarily adopting a simple phenomenological approach.\nA first class of signatures resides in the GW polarization signal. In many modified gravity scenarios, additional polarizations exist beyond the two transverse quadrupolar (+\u00d7)\nmodes of general relativity (e.g., Will 2006). This is the case, for instance, in scalar-tensor\ntheories (including the f(R) variety; Wands 1994; Maggiore & Nicolis 2000; Nakao et al.\n2001) and vector-tensor theories (Bekenstein 2004; Jacobson & Mattingly 2004). Braneworld\ngravity scenarios are no exception since the Kaluza-Klein graviton extra polarizations can\nalso in principle be radiated by various types of sources. The no-hair theorem is traditionally\ninvoked to forbid any extra polarization modes in the signal from two coalescing black holes.\nHowever, it is well known that black hole unicity theorems fail to apply in the usual sense\nto higher dimensional theories (Emparan et al. 2002). Moreover, in DGP gravity the graviton extra polarization is expected to show up at large distances even for (possibly static)\nspherically symmetric space-times (Deffayet et al. 2002b). Black holes can also be hairy in\ntheories of massive gravity (where the graviton carries extra polarizations with respect to\nthose of a massless graviton), in particular when Lorentz invariance is broken (Blas et al.\n2006, 2007; Dubovsky et al. 2007, and references therein).\nA second class of signatures is related to the GW signal propagation velocity which, in\nmodified gravity scenarios, can differ from the speed of light. Propagation can be subluminal\n(e.g., Dubovsky et al. 2005) or superluminal (e.g., Jacobson & Mattingly 2004). The possibility to time a GW signal propagated over cosmological distances, relative to the signal\nfrom a prompt electromagnetic counterpart causally associated with the black hole merger,\nmay thus offer additional diagnostics of large-scale modified gravity. In addition, signatures\nmay emerge because the number of spacetime dimensions available to gravity is odd. In this\ncase, even a massless mode has a Green's function which does not vanish inside its light cone\n(see e.g., Cardoso et al. 2003). Consequences for GW propagation in braneworld gravity\nhave been explored in part (Barvinsky & Solodukhin 2003), but not fully in the case when\ngravity is modified at large distances. Thus, the oddness of spacetime on cosmological scales,\nlike in DGP gravity, could add to the set of modified gravity signatures.\nFinally, a third class of signatures relates to the phase of the GW signal, which could\ndeviate from general relativistic expectations once propagated over cosmological distances.\nIn summary, GWs from cosmologically-distant spacetime sirens may be valuable alternative probes of modified gravity since various signatures may exist in a GW signal propagated\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nover cosmological distances. For some of these signatures to become apparent, the identification of a host galaxy or an electromagnetic counterpart to the spacetime siren is required.\nConversely, the absence of such signatures would constrain gravity modifications and provide\na consistency check on other methods employed to discover the nature of dark energy.\nThis work has made use of the advanced cosmology calculator (Wright 2006).
