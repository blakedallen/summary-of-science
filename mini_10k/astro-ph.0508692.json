Introduction\nThe combination of high-resolution radio observations with\nhigh angular resolution optical imaging and, more recently,\nwith X-ray imaging, contributes important information to the\nstudy of high-redsifht radio galaxies (HzRGs, z > 2). For\nexample, McCarthy et al. (1987) and Chambers et al. (1987)\nhave clearly illustrated, by using radio, optical and UV observations the existence of a radio-aligned optical line-emission\nand UV-continuum, strongly supporting the proposed scenario where a young radio AGN having powerful jets and\nionizing radiation can dramatically affect the environment of\ntheir forming host galaxies. This scenario has been confirmed\nby recent discoveries of similarly radio-aligned X-ray emission (e.g., Carilli et al. 2002, Scharf et al. 2003).\nHigh-resolution radio data is also of high relevance in\nstudying the interaction of the radio sources with gas in the\nputative forming galaxy (e.g., 100 kpc-scale Ly-\u03b1 halos). In\nparticular, the comparison of high-resolution radio and Ly\u03b1 images may point to the interaction between the propagating jet and the surrounding interstellar medium, and constrain\nCorrespondence to: torres@iaa.es\n\nthe relative importance of jet-induced star formation, shock\nionized gas, and dust/electron scattering in forming the observed optical galaxies.\n\n2. VLBI observations of HzRGs\nThe enormous distances at which HzRGs lie, make it necessary to go from 'high-resolution' to 'very high-resolution'\nradio observations, if we are to better understand the physics\nof the individual objects subject to study. We have thus started\na radio programme aimed at studying with VLBI a small\nsample of high-redshift radio galaxies whose peculiar radio\nmorphologies suggest that strong interactions with their surrounding medium are taking place, based on existing highresolution HST optical imaging. Our strategy is to carry out\ndetailed morphological comparisons of radio and optical continua for the sources of the sample, with the goal of distinguishing among the effects of jet-induced star formation.\nVLBI images, of higher resolution than HST optical images,\ncan delineate the shocks associated with the propagation of\nthe jets, and even pinpoint potential sites of star formation. If\nthere is no one-to-one relationship between the radio and optical morphologies, this will likely indicate that scattering is\n\n\f4 RESULTS\n\n3. B3 J2330+3927: A case study\nThe radio galaxy B3 J2330+3927 has been studied at several\nfrequencies by De Breuck et al. (2003), hereafter DB03. The\n8.4 GHz VLA observations of DB03 (see Fig. 1) showed that\nB3 J2330+3927 is a \u223c 2\u2032\u2032 wide source consisting of three radio components, located in between two optical (K\u2212band)\nobjects (a and b). The triple radio morphology in the VLA\nA-array 8.4 GHz map is reminiscent of other radio galaxies,\nwhere the host galaxy is located at the position of the central radio component Optical and near-IR Keck spectroscopy\nof B3 J2330+3927 show AGN emission lines from object a,\nwhile object b has a velocity offset of +1500 km/s with respect to object a. However, no emission lines are seen at the\nposition of the central radio source. Because the relative astrometric uncertainty is <0.\u2032\u2032 4, the central radio component\ncannot be reconciled with the AGN in object a. De Breuck\net al. (2003) proposed two interpretations: (i) the northern\nradio component is the core, implying a one-sided jet radio morphology, or (ii) the marginally resolved central radio\nsource is the radio core, and the AGN is heavily obscured\nat this position. The latter explanation would be inconsistent\nwith the peak of the CO emission, which coincides with object a. As we show below, only the higher angular resolution\nprovided by VLBI, together with spectral index information,\nhas been able to uniquely point to the correct AGN identification.\nWe have recently published (P\u00e9rez-Torres & De Breuck\n2005; hereafter PTDB) new results on B3 J2330+3927, based\non Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 1.7 and 5 GHz carried out on 2004 November 29 and December 9, respectively,\nas well as on archival 1.4 GHz VLA data and our reanalysis\nof the 8.4 GHz VLA data of B3 J2330+3927 (DB03). We analyzed the radio data using the Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS. We used standard phase self-calibration\ntechniques within AIPS to obtain the images shown in Fig. 2.\nWe give in the following section an account of some of the\nresults obtained in PTDB, and refer the reader to that paper\n\na\n\n39 27 14\n\n13\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\nthe dominant mechanism. In addition, a detailed morphological comparison with the Ly-\u03b1 maps may be used to study\nthe interaction between the propagating jet and the surrounding primeval interstellar medium (ISM). This ISM may cause\nthe jets to bend and decollimate, and affect the ionization and\nkinematics of the gas.\nOur sample consists of four sources: B3 J2330+3927\n(z = 3.1), B2 0902+34 (z = 3.4), 4C 41.17 (z = 3.8),\nand TN J1338-1942 (z = 4.1). We observed B3 J2330+3927\non November-December 2004, using the VLBA at 1.7 and\n5.0 GHz. 4C 41.17 and B2 0902+34 have been observed in\nJune 2005 using simultaneously the European VLBI Network\n(EVN) and the Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer\nNetwork (MERLIN) observations, and the data reduction is\nunderway. Here, we report results from our observing campaign on B3 J2330+3927. Throughout the paper, we have assumed a \u039b-dominated universe with \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7,\nand H0 = 65 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .

Results\nFigure 2 shows the reanalyzed 8.4 GHz VLA data on\nB3 J2330+3927, with the archival 1.4 GHz data overlaid.\nIn addition to the three components identified by DB03, we\nalso detect a faint component on the northwestern side of object a. In the following, we call these components A, B, C,\nand N, as identified in Fig. 1. The newly found component,\nA, shows for the first time the detection of the counter-jet in\nB3 J2330+3927, providing support for the interpretation that\nthe radio component N, coincident with object a, is the radio\ncore.\nWe mapped the entire region, encompassing objects A\nthrough C, using the VLBA. Only components N and B were\ndetected, both at 1.7 and 5.0 GHz. The left panel in Fig. 2\nshows the 8.4 GHz map of these components, while the right\npanel displays a blow-up of component N to show the VLBA\ndata at their full resolution (for a detailed report of those observations see PTDB). Our 1.7 GHz VLBA data (contours)\nshows that region N consists of a compact ( <\n\u223c 4 mas in\nsize) core-jet, N1, and a jet feature, N2. Our 5.0 GHz VLBA\ndata only detected component N1, which has a spectral index\n\u03b11.7\n5.0 =\u22120.2\u00b10.1. Component N2 was detected at 1.7 GHz, but\n<\nnot at 5.0 GHz, indicating that \u03b11.7\n5.0 \u223c \u22120.9. Because component N1 has the flattest spectral index of all components in\nour VLBA images, we identified it as the long-sought radio\ncore of B3 J2330+3927.\n\n\f5 DISCUSSION\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n39 27 14\n39 27 12.30\n\nN1\n\nA\n\n13\n\nN\n\n12\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n12.28\n\nB\n11\n\nC\n\nJet\n\n12.26\n\nCore\n\n12.24\n\n10\n\nN2\n\n12.22\n\n8 kpc\n\n160 pc\n\n09\n12.20\n23 30 25.05\n\n25.00\n\n24.95\n\n24.90 24.85 24.80 24.75 24.70\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\n24.65\n\n24.60\n\n23 30 24.841 24.840 24.839 24.838 24.837 24.836 24.835 24.834 24.833 24.832\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\nFig. 2.

The off-source rms noise in the image was of \u223c 60 \u03bcJy at both 1.7 and\n5.0 GHz. Note the protrusion southeast of component N1, which corresponds to the jet emanating from the radio core.\n\n5. Discussion\nThe combined use of VLA and VLBA data, along with the\nexisting multiwavelength observations, allows us to draw a\nconsistent picture of the radio structure of B3 J2330+3927,\nrevealing also several puzzling properties: the compact, flat\nspectrum (\u03b1 \u223c \u22120.2) component N, is the radio core\nof B3 J2330+3927, and is located at the position of the\noptical/near-IR type II AGN and the peak of the CO(43) emission. The 8.4 GHz VLA image reveals a previously\nundetected, faint counterjet (A), confirmed by very deep,\n1.4 GHz VLA observations, and implying that A and C are\nthe closer and farther lobes, respectively, of the radio galaxy.\nThe radio source properties are extremely asymmetric, as indicated by the values of Q, R, and fc .\n\n1.5\n\nB3 J2330+3927\n\n1\nOuter lobe brighter\n0.5\nLog R\n\nThe identification of the core with component N1 confirms that C and the newly found component, A, are the\nradio lobes of B3 J2330+3927. Indeed, wide-field (1\u25e6 \u00d71\u25e6 ),\ndeep 1.4 GHz VLA imaging (PTDB) excludes the presence\nof significant radio emission beyond component A, and no\nother components are seen in the WENSS or NVSS. Thus,\nour identification of component A with the outer radio lobe\nis robust. Now, from the 8.4 GHz reanalyzed data, we find\nthat (a) the fraction of emission from the nuclear component is fc =0.50; (b) the ratio of the core-lobe distances is\nQ = (N 1 \u2212 C)/(N 1 \u2212 A) \u22481.9; and (c) the ratio of the\nflux densities of the further lobe to that of the closer lobe is\nR = SC /SA >\n\u223c 11.\n\n0\n\u22120.5\n\u22121\nOuter lobe fainter\n\u22121.5\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nLog Q\n\nFig. 3. The log Q - log R diagram for the radio galaxies (open\ncircles) and quasars (solid circles) of the Saikia et al. (2001)\nsample, along with our case study source, B3 J2330+3927.\n\nBest et al. (1995) have shown convincing evidence that\nquasars have more asymmetric radio morphologies than radio galaxies, and this finding is consistent with expectations\nof the unified model, namely that quasars and radio galaxies\nare intrinsically similar, but quasars are observed when the\nradio jet axis of the source is within 45 \u25e6 of the line of sight\n(Barthel 1989). We show in Fig. 3 the log Q - log R diagram for the 78 radio galaxies and quasars from the 3CR and\nS4 samples selected by Saikia et al. (1995, 2001). Note that\nthere are no radio galaxies in the diagram with log R >\n\u223c 0.6,\n\n\fReferences\nin contrast with quasars. B3 J2330+3927, with a value of\nlog R=1.04, is thus a very bizarre radio galaxy, and looks\nmore like a quasar. Quasars also display larger fc values\nthan radio galaxies (Saikia 1995). Again, B3 J2330+3927,\nwith half of its 8.4 GHz radio emission coming from the\ncore, looks more like a quasar. Therefore, based on its radio\nmorphology, B3 J2330+3927 would be classified as a type I\nAGN. However, the optical and near-IR Keck spectra (Fig. 5\nof DB03) clearly show only narrow emission lines with relatively strong HeII \u03bb 1640 and very faint H\u03b2 typical of type II\nAGN. Moreover, the optical and near-IR continuum emission\nis weak and relatively red, as is common in type II AGN.\nWhat is then the most likely explanation for the observed\nasymmetries in the radio structure of B3 J2330+3927? Up to\nnow, almost all cases of asymmetry in radio galaxies have\nbeen explained by environmental effects. In the most detailed\nstudy to date, McCarthy et al. (1991) find that for radio-loud\ntype II AGN, the radio lobe closest to the core always lies\non the same side of the nucleus as the high surface brightness optical line emission. This is contrary to what is seen\nin B3 J2330+3927. In fact, Fig. 4 of DB03 shows that the\nLy-\u03b1 emission extends from the radio core N to the southern radio lobe C, which is almost twice further away from\nthe core than the faint radio lobe A. One could argue that the\nLy-\u03b1 emission towards lobe A is quenched by dust, which is\nrevealed by its strong far-IR emission (Stevens et al. 2003,\nDB03). However, the spatial profiles of the non-resonant\n[OII] \u03bb 3727 and [OIII] \u03bb 5007 lines in the Keck/NIRC spectra of DB03 show a similar shape, with no emission towards\nlobe A, indicating that no substantial emission line flux is\nmissing in the Ly-\u03b1 profile. Environmental effects thus do\nnot seem to play a major role in the radio morphology of\nB3 J2330+3927.\nIf the observed asymmetries are due to relativistic beaming effects, then the fact that B3 J2330+3927 is a clear type II\nAGN restricts the viewing angle with respect to the line of\nsight to \u03c6>45\u25e6 (Barthel 1989). However, the fraction of the\nemission from the nuclear component, fc =0.50 at 8.4 GHz,\nis very large for a radio galaxy, and suggests the viewing\nangle must be then close to the \u03c6=45\u25e6 limit. If this is case,\nthe obtained arm-length ratio Q \u22481.9 requires a jet velocity of \u03b2 \u2248 0.45c. Now, the observed ratio of the flux densities of components C and A is R >\n\u223c 11. If components A\nand C are optically-thin, isotropically emitting jets, their flux\nratio should then be, within the relativistic beaming scenario,\n< 6 if the jet is made of discrete condensations, or < 4 if\n\u223c\n\u223c\nit is a continuous jet (an index of \u03b1=\u22120.9 has been assumed).\nOur observed value of R >\n\u223c 11 is therefore difficult to explain\nwithin the standard relativistic beaming framework.\nThe remaining explanation is an intrinsic difference in\nthe radio jets thus seems to be the most likely explanation\nof the observed asymmetry. Examples of such radio galaxies\nare very rare in the literature, and have only been reported\nat low redshifts. Sources like B3 J2330+3927 and 4C 63.07\nare difficult to reconcile with predictions from the standard\nunified model.\nIt is also remarkable the lack of increased Ly-\u03b1 emission near the region where the radio jet is deflected between\n\ncomponents N and B. In fact, Fig. 2 of PTDB shows a clear\nchange in position angle between the jet-like feature emanating from the core, N, and the line connecting components B1\nand B2. However, no increase in the Ly-\u03b1 emission is seen in\nthe 2D spectrum (Fig. 4 of DB03), in contrast to similarly deflected radio jets in other HzRGs, showing bright Ly-\u03b1 emission at these bendings (e.g., van Ojik et al. 1996).\n\n6. Summary\nWe have reported on 1.7 and 5.0 GHz VLBA observations\nof the high-redshift radio galaxy B3 J2330+3927 (z=3.087).\nThe combination of these observations with archival 8.4 GHz\nand 1.4 GHz VLA-A data has helped us interpret the source\nradio morphology: we have pinpointed the core and jet of\nthe radio galaxy, and discovered a faint counter lobe, which\ncontrary to what has been seen in other radio galaxies lies\nmuch farther from the nucleus than the brighter lobe. The\nvalues of core-lobe distance ratio and flux density ratio, as\nwell as the fraction of core emission make of B3 J2330+3927\nan extremely asymmetric source, and challenges the standard\nunification model, which explains the differences between\nquasars and radio galaxies as due to orientation effects.\nThe results obtained from our VLBA observations of\nB3 J2330+3927 clearly show that very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of HzRGs can contribute crucial\ninformation towards a detailed interpretation of the physics\nof those objects.\nAcknowledgements.
