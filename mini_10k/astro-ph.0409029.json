Heinz\nCenter for Space Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139\nChandra Fellow\n\n1 September 2004\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe present an extension of the scale invariance formalism by Heinz & Sunyaev (2003) which\nincludes the effects of radiative cooling on the X-ray synchrotron emission from core dominated jets and outflows. We derive the scaling relations between the radio luminosity Lr , the\nsynchrotron X-ray luminosity Lx , the mass M , and the accretion rate \u1e41 of an accreting black\nhole. We argue that the inclusion of synchrotron losses into the scaling relations is required by\nthe data used in Merloni et al. (2003) to define the \"fundamental plane\" correlation between\nLr , Lx , and M in AGNs amd Galactic X-ray binaries. We then fit the new scaling relations\nto the \"fundamental plane\" correlation. This allows us to derive statistical constraints on the\ncontribution from jet synchrotron emission to the X-rays from black holes, or, alternatively, on\nthe particle acceleration scheme at work in these jets. We find that, in order for jet synchrotron\nX-rays to be consistent with the observed Lr \u2212 Lx \u2212 M correlation, the global particle spec+0.6\ntrum must be both steep: f (\u03b3) \u221d \u03b3 \u2212(3.4\u22120.5 ) and unbroken down to energies well below the\nradio synchrotron regime. Such a steep particle distribution would imply steeper X-ray spectra\nthan observed in most sources contributing to the correlation with avalailable X-ray spectral\nindex measurements. We suggest that, unless some assumptions of the scale invariance hypothesis are broken, another emission mechanism (likely either disk radiation and/or inverse\nCompton scattering in the jet) contributes significantly to the X-rays of a sizeable fraction of\nthe sources.\nKey words: radiative mechanisms: non-thermal \u2013 galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: nuclei \u2013 galaxies: jets \u2013 x-rays: binaries \u2013 radio: continuum: general\n\nIn recent years, however, this paradigm has been called into\nquestion. Beginning with a re\u2013evaluation of the emission processes\nin Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs), an alternative view has been\nproposed to interpret a large part of the spectrum (including X-rays)\nof black holes at moderate to low accretion rates entirely as due to\nthe emission from the jet (Markoff et al. 2001, 2003; Falcke et al.\n2004).\n\nThe strong correlation between the radio and the X-ray emission\nin X-ray binaries that has been found recently (Corbel et al. 2003;\nGallo et al. 2003) can be interpreted in terms of both pictures. Similarly, the correlation between radio luminosity Lr , X-ray luminosity Lx , and black hole mass M is consistent with both pictures\n(Merloni et al. 2003; Falcke et al. 2004).\nIn order to investigate the relation between Lxr , Lx , and\nM , Heinz & Sunyaev (2003) derived robust and very general\nscaling relations between these observables which are independent of the underlying jet model (e.g. Blandford & Ostriker 1978;\nFalcke & Biermann 1995), provided that jet physics is scale invariant under changes in black hole mass M and accretion rate\n\u1e41 = \u1e40 /\u1e40Edd (where \u1e40Edd is the Eddington accretion rate).\nThe striking agreement with the subsequently found \"fundamental plane\" relation of accreting black holes (Merloni et al. 2003;\nFalcke et al. 2004) seems to confirm the scale invariance hypothesis1 .\n\nIt has been difficult to find unique signatures that would allow\nus to distinguish between these two alternatives. Broad band spectral modeling is the most promising approach, but so far it has not\nbeen shown conclusively that either of the two approaches fails.\n\n1 While the influence of interactions between the jet and the environment\nmust affect the radiative signature of jets on larger scales (Heinz & Sunyaev\n2002), we note that the scaling relation predicted by Heinz & Sunyaev\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nFor many years, the standard paradigm for the X-ray emission in\naccreting black hole systems has been that the X-rays are produced in the central accretion flow (e.g., Shakura & Sunyaev 1973;\nShapiro et al. 1976; Narayan & Yi 1994), while radio emission was\ntraditionally attributed to a radio jet. Only in the most powerful,\nbeamed jet sources was X-ray synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemission from the jet invoked to explain the featureless powerlaw\nspectra of Blazars and BL-Lacs (e.g. Fossati et al. 1998).\n\n\f2\n\nS. Heinz\n\nThe original treatment of Heinz & Sunyaev (2003) did, however, leave out some critical physical ingredients required to describe the X-ray synchrotron emission from jets, namely, radiative\ncooling of the particle distribution, which alters the spectral shape\nat higher energies. In this paper, we will present an extension of\nthe formalism developed in Heinz & Sunyaev (2003) that allows us\nto include radiative cooling (\u00a72 and \u00a7A1). We then proceed to investigate the data of the \"fundamental plane\" relation for signs of\nradiative cooling and discuss limits we can put on the contribution\nof X-ray synchrotron radiation from jets to the spectra of AGNs\nand XRBs by fitting the derived scaling relations to the fundamental plane correlation (\u00a73). Section 4 summarizes the conclusions we\ndraw from this analysis.\n\nits value at the base of the jet. Any non-trivial dependence of f\non the black hole spin a is assumed to be implicit in the functions\n\u03c8f and will not be discussed further. For consistency, we will also\nassume that the jet velocity \u03b2\u0393 is independent of black hole mass\nand accretion rate, such that \u03b2\u0393 = \u03c8\u03b2\u0393 (\u03c7). It is still not known\nwhat the true jet plasma velocities are, especially close to the base\nof the jet, but future constraints will hopefully shed some light on\nthis subject. If this assumption is not satisfied, the formalism can\neasily be altered to include such an M or \u1e41 dependence as long as\nthe four-velocity \u03b2\u0393 can be written in the form of eq. (1).\nGiven these assumptions, we can proceed to include radiative\ncooling into the treatment. We will assume that a fraction of the jet\nparticles are accelerated at some arbitrary time t0 (measured in the\njet frame) into a powerlaw such that\nf (\u03b3, t0 ) = \u03c6C \u03b3 \u2212p\n\n2 SCALE INVARIANCE IN JETS WITH RADIATIVE\nLOSSES\nIn Heinz & Sunyaev (2003) we derived the scaling relations between synchrotron radio luminosity Lr , black hole mass M , and\naccretion rate \u1e40 . Because radiative losses introduce another scale\ninto the problem, we chose to ignore the effect of synchrotron cooling on the particle distribution, given the scope of the paper. As we\nwill show below, it is possible to incorporate these effects without\nloss of generality, because the scale introduced by cooling depends\nitself only on the mass and accretion rate of the black hole and does\nnot enter into the dynamical properties of the jet plasma at all. This\nis because cooling affects primarily the highest energy particles,\nwhile most of the jet kinetic energy and thrust are carried by the\nlow energy particles (in other words, jets are believed to be radiatively inefficient).\n\n2.1 The scale invariance hypothesis for cooled jets\nIn order to include the effects of radiative cooling into the scale\ninvariance formalism (Heinz & Sunyaev 2003), we shall briefly review the aspects of the scale invariance ansatz relevant to this article. For a detailed discussion, we refer the interested reader to the\noriginal article.\nThe scale invariance ansatz assumes that there is only one relevant scale in the problem of jet dynamics (at least in the cores\nof jets which we are focusing on here): the gravitational radius\nrg = GM/c2 . It also assumes that the structure of all core jets1\nfrom black holes is the same when set in relation to rg . Mathematically, the scale invariance assumption can be formulated as the\nrequirement that any dynamical quantity f relevant to calculating\nthe synchrotron emission from jets (such as the normalization of the\npowerlaw distribution of electrons, the magnetic field, or the particle pressure) can be decomposed into two functions \u03c6f (M, \u1e41) and\n\u03c8f (\u03c7), such that\nf (M, \u1e41, r) = \u03c6f (M, \u1e41)\u03c8f (\u03c7)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the definition \u03c7 = r/rg implies that \u03c8f depends only on\nscale\u2013free coordinates (x, y, z)/rg .\nThe functions \u03c6f define the normalization of f at the base\nof the jet (as provided by the accretion disk), while the structure\nfunctions \u03c8f describe the variation of f along the jet, relative to\n(2003) for optically thin synchrotron emission agrees very well with the\ntentative mass and accretion rate dependence of the optically thin radio luminosity of extended jets found by Sams et al. (1996).\n\n(2)\n\nand then evolve through adiabatic and radiative cooling as they\nmove downstream from the acceleration region.\nWhile it is not necessary to assume that this acceleration takes\nplace in one particular location (it can be spatially extended, in\nwhich case the integral in eq. (A15) can be performed in a piecewise fashion for every acceleration zone), it will be necessary to\nmake the assumption that the spatial distribution of the acceleration (i.e., the various positions of the acceleration regions measured\nin units of gravitational radii rg ) and the shape of the powerlaw\nare invariant under changes of M and \u1e41 (in line with the assumptions necessary to derive the original scale invariance properties in\nHeinz & Sunyaev 2003). This implies that the injection time in the\njet frame t0 is proportional to t0 \u221d rg \u221d M . This is reasonable if\nthe particle acceleration is associated with a hydrodynamic process,\nsuch as a recollimation shock, since the underlying hydrodynamics\nis also assumed to be scale invariant.\nFurthermore, we will assume that the particle pressure is dominated by the low energy end of the particle distribution, which\nimplies that the slope of the particle distribution produced by the\nacceleration process is steeper than p >\n\u223c 2. Classical Fermi I\nshock acceleration in strong, non-relativistic shocks produces spectra with index p >\n\u223c 2 (Blandford & Ostriker 1978; Bell 1978;\nDrury et al. 1982), while the spectral index produced in strong relativistic shocks is somewhat steeper, p \u223c 2.3 (Gallant et al. 1999;\nAchterberg et al. 2001).\nThese indices agree nicely with the observed optically thin radio synchrotron spectra of extended jets with spectral indices of\norder 0.5 <\n\u223c 0.7 (where the radio spectral index is defined as\n\u223c \u03b1r <\n\u03b1r \u2261 \u2212\u2202(log Fr )/\u2202(log \u03bd)). For this reason, we will assume in the\nfollowing that the fiducial spectral index of the uncooled electron\ndistribution falls into the range 2 6 p 6 2.3. The fiducial uncooled\nsynchrotron spectral index falls into the range 0.5 6 \u03b1 6 0.65.\nMore recent efforts studying particle acceleration in jets are focusing on continuous particle acceleration mechanisms like reconnection (e.g. Larrabee et al. 2003), which might be necessary to explain the lack of synchrotron cooling signatures in some extended\nAGN jets like 3C273 (Jester et al. 2001).\n2.2 Scaling relations\nWith the basic set of assumptions in place, we proceed to derive the\nscaling relations for the X-ray synchrotron emission from jet cores\nincluding the effects of radiative cooling on the particle distribution. The complete mathematical derivation used in the remainder\nof this paper is presented in the appendix.

Sketch of viable synchrotron spectra in different regimes for three\ndifferent measured radio-to-X-ray ratios. Optically thick parts are shown as\nsolid lines, optically thin, uncooled parts are shown as dashed lines, optically thin, radiatively cooled parts are shown as dotted lines. The grey\ndashed line through LX3 shows an X-ray spectrum that is flatter than the\nglobal spectrum, which would require a concave spectrum and would be\ninconsistent with simple synchrotron X-rays.\n\nSynchrotron cooling of a population of electrons in the presence of a source of fresh powerlaw particles (which is the appropriate model for a continuous jet) will produce a cooling break in\nthe global spectrum, as sketched in Fig. 1. Given the field strength\nB, the characteristic \"cooling energy\" of this break in the electron\nspectrum is (e.g. Rybicki & Lightman 1979, also, see eqs. (A4a)\n\u0003\u22121\n\u0002\n,\nand (A5) for a derivation of this expression) \u03b3b \u223c A0 B 2 tjet\nwhere tjet \u223c rjet /vjet \u221d M is the characteristic travel time\nof the electrons. Using eq. (1), this expression becomes \u03b3b \u221d\n\u03c6B (M, \u1e41)\u22122 M \u22121 . The characteristic synchrotron frequency corresponding to this electron energy is\n\u03bdb \u221d B\u03b3b2 \u221d [\u03c6B (M, \u1e41)]\u22123 M \u22122\n\n(3)\n\nWe will assume that the spectrum has a break at \u03bdb with powerlaw index \u03b1x above \u03bdb and with the standard powerlaw index\n\u03b1 = (p \u2212 1)/2 below \u03bdb (see sketch in Fig. 1). Given the expression for \u03bdb from eq. (3), the flux at a fixed frequency \u03bdx above the\ncooling break \u03bdb is a simple function of the flux F\u03bd0 at a fixed frequency \u03bd0 below the cooling break, the black hole mass M , and the\naccretion rate \u1e41:\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bd0\n\u03bdb\n\n\u0011(p\u22121)/2 \u0010\n\n\u03bdb\n\u03bdx\n\n\u0011\u2212\u03b1x\n\n(4)\n\nThe uncooled, optically thin jet flux F (\u03bd0 ) depends on M and \u1e41\nas follows (Heinz & Sunyaev 2003):\np+1\n2\n\nF (\u03bd0 ) \u221d M 3 \u03c6B\n\n\u221d\n=\n\nLX2\n\n10\u22128\n\nF (\u03bdx ) = F\u03bd0\n\n3\n\n(M, \u1e41)\u03c6C (M, \u1e41)\n\n(5)\n\nWith the expression for F (\u03bdx ) as a function of F (\u03bd0 ), M , and \u1e41\nfrom above, we have\n2p\u22121\u22123\u03b1x\nF (\u03bdx ) \u221d M 2+p\u2212\u03b1x \u03c6B\n\u03c6C\n\n(6)\n\nWriting this expression in differential form, we arrive at the scaling\nrelation derived in full generality in the appendix in eq.

In other words, we can substitute\nobservable quantities (in this case the X-ray and the particle spectral indices \u03b1x and p respectively) for the unknown details of particle acceleration and cooling2 . It is important to keep in mind that p\nis the electron spectral index produced by the acceleration process,\ni.e. below the cooling break and thus without any modification due\nto cooling. p is therefore not observable via the X-ray spectral index. Rather, optically thin, uncooled radio, sub-millimeter, or IR\nemission should be used to infer p, since this radiation should not\nbe affected by synchrotron losses.\nIn the following we will use the same canonical functional\nforms for \u03c6B and \u03c6C used in (Heinz & Sunyaev 2003). Namely, we\nassume that the underlying accretion flow is mechanically cooled3 ,\nin which case the accretion flow itself is scale invariant. Then\n\u03c6C = \u03c6B 2 = \u1e41M \u22121\n\n(10)\n\nThis prescription is also valid for coronae above gas pressuredominated, radiatively efficient (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) accretion disks (the standard scenario for the origin of powerlaw X-ray\nemission and the launching point for jets from geometrically thin\naccretion disks, e.g. Merloni & Fabian 2002). We then have\n3 \u2212 \u03b1x\n(11)\n2\n1 \u2212 3\u03b1x\n\u03bex\u1e41 = p +\n(12)\n2\nThese are the expressions we will use in the remainder of this paper\nto fit the \"fundamental plane\" correlation. In the uncooled limit of\n\u03b1x = (p \u2212 1)/2, they reduce to the expressions derived for the\noptically thin case from eq. (5). In the canonical case of p = 2, we\nhave Fx \u221d M (3\u2212\u03b1x )/2 \u1e41(5\u22123\u03b1x )/2 .\nSince the \"fundamental plane\" correlation is measured between the radio and X-ray luminosities and the black hole mass,\nwe should convert the scaling relations to those coordinates.

(2003) interpreted this correlation in terms of the\nscale invariance model. From the observed correlation, it is unclear\nwhether the source of the X-rays is, in fact, synchrotron emission\nfrom the jet, or whether it is emission from an inefficiently accreting disk; both can produce similar correlation coefficients in the\ncontext of the scale invariance model. The scaling relations for\ninefficient disk X-rays do produce a better fit to the fundamental\nplane, but Merloni et al. (2003) noted that the effects of synchrotron\nlosses on the synchrotron X-ray emission from the jet had not been\nincluded in their treatment and might improve the fit to the fundamental plane data. Given the analysis presented in the previous section, we can now proceed to include these effects and test whether\nthey improve the fit or not.\n3.1 Spectral evidence for synchrotron cooling\nBefore applying the scaling relations derived in eqs. (15) and (16)\nto the \"fundamental plane\" sample, we shall present a brief argument that the inclusion of cooling into the scale invariance relations\npresented above is not just useful, but actually necessary to properly\ninterpret the fundamental plane data in the context of synchrotron\njet X-rays.\nFirst, we will check the global radio-X-ray spectra of individual sources against the hypothesis that the X-rays originate in the jet\nas optically thin, uncooled synchrotron emission. In this case, the\nX-ray spectrum should continue from the X-rays to lower frequencies at the standard synchrotron spectral index \u03b1x = (p \u2212 1)/2,\nuntil it reaches the turnover frequency where the jet becomes optically thick to synchrotron self absorption (see Fig. 1). At this point,\nthe spectrum becomes flat. This implies that the spectrum is convex\nat every point between the radio and X-ray bands.\nTherefore, if the global spectral index \u03b1rx is steeper than the\nfiducial uncooled X-ray spectral index \u03b1X = (p \u2212 1)/2, radiative\ncooling must have steepened the jet synchrotron spectrum at X-ray\nenergies (this corresponds to point LX3 in Fig. 1). Only a cooling\nbreak/cutoff can reduce the X-ray flux to the observed level (even if\nthe radio spectrum is optically thick)4 . This constraint corresponds\nto the horizontal dashed grey line in Fig. 2, and a number of sources\nlie above this line, showing that radiative cooling must be included\n4\n\nIf the X-rays originate in the disk, this limit becomes even stronger, since\nthe jet-spectral index is then even steeper, thus also implying the action of\nradiative cooling.\n\nin the treatment of these sources. Note that relativistic beaming and\nuncorrelated radio/X-ray variability do not change this conclusion.\nOn the other hand, if the global spectral index \u03b1rx,FP is flatter than the fiducial uncooled synchrotron spectrum (point LX1 in\nFig. 1, all points below the dashed grey line in Fig. 2), we cannot\nsay anything about the action of radiative cooling. All we can conclude in this case is that either the radio synchrotron emission must\nbe self-absorbed (thus flattening the global synchrotron spectrum),\nor the X-rays must be from the disk (thus increasing the X-ray flux\nrelative to the radio).\nFor a sub-set of the sources in the \"fundamental plane\" sample, the X-ray spectral indices \u03b1x have actually been measured,\nthough for some sources with very large error bars. All of these\nsources are AGNs, as the RXTE-ASM data used in compiling the\n\"fundamental plane\" sample are not sufficient to determine the\nspectral slope between 2 and 10 keV. However, we note that for\nXRBs in the low-hard state, where the radio-X-ray correlation is\nobserved to hold, the X-ray powerlaw spectra are typically hard with 0.5 <\n\u223c 1.0. Most of what will be discussed regarding\n\u223c \u03b1x <\nthe AGN with measured \u03b1x will also hold for these sources.\nWe have plotted the global and X-ray spectral indices of all\nAGNs in the sample where \u03b1x has been measured in Fig. 2. This\nfigure shows several interesting things:\n\n\u2022 Some sources have global spectra steeper than \u03b1rx > 0.65\n(above the dotted grey line), which implies that they are affected by\ncooling or have unusually steep particle spectra. Because XRBs are\ngenerally less radio loud than AGNs, all XRBs fall well below this\nline (they are not shown on this plot for lack of \u03b1x measurements),\nthus, this observational constraint on the importance of cooling is\nnot available for XRBs.\n\u2022 Most of the sources in the plot have X-ray spectra steeper than\nthe fiducial uncooled synchrotron spectrum of \u03b1X > 0.65 (right of\ndashed grey line). This indicates that, if the X-rays are due to synchrotron emission, (1) radiative cooling should have altered their\nspectrum or (2) the particle injection spectrum must be steeper than\ntypical Fermi I shock acceleration.\n\u2022 About 25% of the sources in the plot actually fall into the area\nleft of the solid black line where the X-ray spectral index is flatter\nthan the global spectral index (corresponding to the dashed grey\nline through point LX3 in Fig. 1), i.e., \u03b1x < \u03b1rx . These sources\nhave concave global spectra and the X-rays from these sources cannot be due to X-ray synchrotron emission from the jet, unless a particle acceleration scheme is at work that produces concave electron\nspectra. Again, all XRBs lie well below this line, so this observational constraint on the nature of the emission mechanism is not\navailable for XRBs. We note that the error bars on \u03b1x for all of the\nsources left of the line are large. Thus, it is prudent not to draw any\nfirm conclusions from this seeming discrepancy at this point and\nawait better observational determinations of \u03b1x for these sources.\n\nIn summary, we find that radiative cooling must be at work in\nmost of the AGNs contributing to the \"fundamental plane\" sample,\nunless the particle spectra are intrinsically somewhat steeper than\nthose produced in Fermi I acceleration and typically observed in\noptically thin radio synchrotron spectra of relativistic jets. This underlines the need for radiative cooling to be included in properly\nmodeling the \"fundamental plane\" correlation.\n\n\fConstraints on jet X-rays\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\ncooling\n\n\u03b1rx\n\n0.6\n\nbest fit to\nfunamental plane\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b1\n\nx\n\n<\u03b1\n\nrx\n\ncooling\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n\u03b1x\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nFigure 2.

We will assume in the following that the radio emission is unaffected by radiative cooling. Therefore, if the\nX-rays originate in the disk, the scaling relations from the scale\ninvariance model (Heinz & Sunyaev 2003) are unaltered and we\nwill not discuss them any further, apart from reminding the reader\nthat they provide the best fit to the observed correlation, provided\nthat the disk emission is radiatively inefficient, (with Lx \u221d \u1e412\nMerloni et al. 2003).\nIf the X-rays originate in the jet, however, we must include radiative cooling, based on the arguments presented in \u00a73.1. The presence of a cooling break in the spectrum was already discussed in\n\u00a72. We define the magnitude of the break as \u2206\u03b1x \u2261 \u03b1x \u2212(p\u22121)/2.\nWe will assume in the following that this break lies below the X-ray\nband for all sources of interest. If this were not the case, the break\nwould move through the X-ray band and produce an observable\nchange in the correlation coefficients. Given the scatter in the \"fundamental plane\" relation, we cannot rule out such a change with\nany certainty. We note that the presence of such a change would be\nan indication of jet X-rays. The dependence of the break frequency\n\u03bdb on M , \u1e41 (or alternatively, Fx ), and the radio luminosity Lr can\nbe easily calculated from eqs. (A5) and (A12) and compared to future data.\nWe will now use eqs. (15) and (16) to test whether radiative\ncooling will improve the fit of synchrotron X-rays to the \"fundamental plane\" correlation. In the simplest possible case of continuous injection of fresh powerlaw particles with index p (e.g., by a\nstationary shock) without any adiabatic losses, the spectral break\nproduced by cooling is \u2206\u03b1x = 1/2. Thus, for a canonical synchrotron spectrum of index p = 2, \u03b1 = 1/2, and \u2206\u03b1x = 1/2,\nthe steepened spectrum above the break has a powerlaw index\n\n5\n\nof \u03b1x = 1. Inserting this value into eqs. (15) and (16) gives\nFx \u221d M \u1e41 and thus \u03beRM = 0 and \u03beRX = 1.42.\nThis implies that cooled synchrotron emission from the jet\nfollows the exact same scaling relation as efficient disk X-rays.\nAs shown in Merloni et al. (2003), radiatively efficient disk X-rays\nare inconsistent with the observed correlation coefficients of the\n\"fundamental plane\". This is clear from comparing \u03beRM = 0 and\n\u03beRX = 1.42 with the measured correlation coefficients of 0.78\nand 0.6 respectively. Thus, jet X-rays, in the most straightforward\nscenario of synchrotron emission (which includes cooling and the\ncanonical range of particle spectral indices), are not compatible\nwith the observed correlation.\nWe can ask the broader question under what conditions the\nscaling relations predicted by synchrotron X-rays are actually consistent with the observed correlation coefficients. We will do this\nby fitting the \"fundamental plane\" data set with the correlation coefficients \u03beRM and \u03beRX from eqs. (15) and (16). We will ignore\nupper limits in the data and use the same merit chi-square estimator employed in Merloni et al. (2003); Gebhardt et al. (2000). We\nalso use the same error estimate, i.e., we assume isotropic errors in\nall variables and normalize them such that the reduced chisquare of\nthe best fit is one. This is equivalent to equating the scatter in the\nfundamental plane to the uncertainty and is a conservative approach\nfor calculating errors.\nFigure 3 shows a chi-square map for the two interesting parameters \u2206\u03b1x and p (marginalized over the unknown relative normalization between radio and X-ray flux). As expected, the figure\nshows that a standard cooled synchrotron spectrum with p = 2 and\na cooling break of \u2206\u03b1c = 0.5 is inconsistent with the correlation\ncoefficients derived from the \"fundamental plane\" relation by more\nthan 3 sigma. The best fit actually requires a steep, unbroken pow+0.13\nand \u03b1x = 1.2+0.3\nerlaw with p = 3.4+0.6\n\u22120.25 , where\n\u22120.5 , \u2206\u03b1c = 0\u22120\nthe lower bound on \u2206\u03b1c > 0 is set by the condition that radiative cooling cannot produce positive curvature in the spectrum over\na large range in wavelengths. Formally, the best fit would actually\nrequire a negative value of \u2206\u03b1.\nSuch a steep value of p is not in line with the particle spectra produced by Fermi I acceleration in shocks. Furthermore, this\nvalue of \u03b1x is significantly larger than the mean and median of the\nmeasured X-ray powerlaw spectra in Fig. 2. Most of the sources\nin this figure lie to the left of the grey 1-\u03c3 confidence limit on \u03b1x\nderived from Fig. 3. The immediate conclusion from this discrepancy is that synchrotron cooling, which should be at work in these\nsources (as argued in \u00a72) does not improve the fit to the \"fundamental plane\" (as speculated by Merloni et al. 2003). To the contrary, it\nactually makes it worse.\nMerloni et al. (2003) and Maccarone et al. (2003) discuss the\npossibility that the radio-X-ray-mass correlation of the \"fundamental plane\" breaks down at high accretion rates and that different\nemission mechanisms are responsible for the X-rays above and below the break. However, repeating the analysis with a sample limited to low X-ray luminosities (Lx < 10\u22123 LEdd ) does not change\nthe conclusions reached above, only the confidence contours in\n0.2\nFig. 3 are slightly less stringent: p = 3.3+0.8\n\u22120.6 , \u2206\u03b1x = 0.1\u22120.1 ,\n,\nas\nshown\nby\nthe\nwhite\ncontours\nin\nFig.\n3.\nand \u03b1x = 1.25+0.35\n\u22120.3\nIn fact, the X-ray spectra of the low luminosity sources (white\ndots in Fig. 2) tend to be flatter than those of the high luminosity sources (black dots). While all the observed spectral indices in\nFig. 2 are from AGNs, the same is known to be the case in XRBs,\nwhich typically show harder spectra in their low luminosity state.\nThus, most of the observed X-ray spectral indices of low luminosity sources are significantly flatter than the range in \u03b1x allowed by\n\n\f6\n\nS. Heinz\ninverse Compton scattering. A radiative signature of this component must be visible, since it would dominate the radiative output\nof the jet (presumably in the X-rays). Alternatively, a somewhat\nfine\u2013tuned adiabatic loss scheme could keep the synchrotron cooling break always below the local turnover frequency.\n\n0.8\n\n3\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u2206\u03b1c\n\n0.6\n\n3\u03c3\n\n0.4\n2\u03c3\n\n2\n3\u03c3 \u03c3\n\n\u03c3\n\n2\u03c3\n\n3\n\n0.2\n\n1\u03c3\n\n1\u03c3\n\n0.0\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\np\n\nFigure 3.

Such a steep, unbroken\nparticle distribution can be achieved in two ways:\na) The particle acceleration process produces inherently steep spectra with p \u223c 3 (unlike Fermi I acceleration), and radiative cooling is\nunimportant even at X-ray energies. However, for radiative cooling\nto have no effect, even on the X-ray emitting electrons, the magnetic fields in the inner jet would have to be very low.\nb) Particle acceleration produces spectra close to p \u223c 2, but radiative cooling steepens the spectra to an index of p \u223c 3 all the\nway down below radio frequencies (in which case the formalism\nabove cannot distinguish between cooling and an intrinsically steep\nspectrum). However, the jet is optically thick at lower frequencies. The cooling coefficient for electrons radiating below the selfabsorption turnover frequency is significantly reduced (McCray\n1969; Ghisellini et al. 1988), and an unbroken powerlaw is not a\nsolution to the kinetic equation in this case. The self-absorption\nbarrier can be circumvented if radiation losses are dominated by\n\nHowever, such a steep global spectrum is inconsistent with\nthe flatter radio spectral indices observed in larger scale optically\nthin jet sources (like M87, GRS 1915+105, 3C273, etc.) and would\ntherefore require additional particle acceleration on larger spatial\nscales. It is also inconsistent with the standard scenario for producing flat radio spectra (Blandford & Ostriker 1978). And for most\nsources in Fig. 2 (and XRBs in the low-hard state), the observed\nX-ray spectral indices \u03b1x are much shallower than this. Ultimately,\nbroad band spectra of the jet core are necessary to verify the spectral index of the optically thin part of the spectrum over a large\nfrequency range and for a number of sources with different M and\n\u1e41 to determine p unequivocally.\n3.3.2 Scale invariance violated\nIt is possible that the X-rays of all sources in the sample are of\nsynchrotron\u2013jet origin, but that jets are inherently not scale invariant and the analysis presented above and in Heinz & Sunyaev\n(2003) does not apply. However, the presence of a strong correlation and its agreement with the scale invariance predictions\nwould be a coincidence. Moreover, specific models used by\nMarkoff et al. (2001) and Markoff et al. (2003) (based on the original, scale invariant jet model by Blandford & K\u00f6nigl 1979) and by\nFalcke & Biermann (1995), Markoff et al. (2003), and Falcke et al.\n(2004) to model the correlation and the broad band spectra of individual sources are themselves members of the class of scale invariant models. Such a lack of scale invariance would require a more\ncomplex approach at understanding jet spectra and correlations.\n3.3.3 Other sources of X-ray emission\nFinally, the discrepancy can be resolved if the X-ray emission from\nat least a significant fraction of the sources in the \"fundamental\nplane\" sample does not originate as synchrotron emission in the\njet, but either a) in the disk, as long as the X-ray emission from\nthe disk is inefficient in the sense that Fx \u221d \u1e412 , or b) as inverse\nCompton emission from the jet, with seed photons provided by the\naccretion flow, the jet radio synchrotron emission, or the companion (Georganopoulos et al. 2002; Markoff & Nowak 2004).\nThe disk interpretation would be in line with the fact that the\ninefficient disk X-ray scenario provides the best global fit to the\nfundamental plane relation. Discussing the inverse Compton scenario is beyond the scope of this paper. It is clear, though, that the\npresence of the radio-X-ray-mass correlation will impose similar\nlimits on a Compton scenario as is the case in disk X-rays (e.g., it\nmight help us to determine the source of the up-scattered photons,\ni.e., disk vs. synchrotron-self-Compton). Clearly, further research\nis necessary to explore this scenario.\nGiven the large scatter in the fundamental plane relation, the\nX-rays of at least a part of the sample might still be predominantly\njet\u2013synchrotron emission. In fact, it is quite plausible to expect that\nall three emission mechanisms will make a contribution to the Xray spectrum of any given source at some level. It might well be that\nin different sources, different X-ray emission mechanisms dominate, leading to the significant observed scatter in the \"fundamental\nplane\". For example, the X-rays from Galactic XRBs in the low\n\n\fConstraints on jet X-rays\nhard state might be of jet synchrotron origin, while the X-rays from\nAGNs might originate primarily in the disk (or vice versa). In this\ncase, the fact that both XRBs and AGNs fall on the same relation\nwould be a coincidence5 .\nThe scaling relations derived above and in Heinz & Sunyaev\n(2003); Falcke & Biermann (1995) can help to distinguish between\nthese different types of sources in a large enough, well characterized sample, which is clearly a primary objective for future research\nin this area.\n\n7\n\nvary randomly, since the radio-X-ray correlation would otherwise\nbe a coincidence.\nThus, while we expect all of these effects to be present and to be\nimportant on a detailed, quantitative level, we believe that they do\nnot alter the fundamental presence of the correlation and that we\ncan use a statistical approach (i.e., measuring the correlation coefficient) to learn something about the underlying nature of the emitter.\nHowever, all of these effects will contribute to the scatter and the\nuncertainty in any conclusion and must therefore be better characterized in future studies.\n\n3.4 Caveats\nSome caveats and sources of uncertainty should be kept in mind\nwhen interpreting these results:\na) The \"fundamental plane\" sample is a relatively diverse sample,\ncontaining several different types of AGNs, spanning a large range\nin accretion rate and black hole mass (see Merloni et al. 2003 for a\ndetailed discussion of the properties of the sample), mostly for the\nsake of a large number of sources and for testing the universality of\nthe correlation. This is in line with the suggestion from \u00a73.3.3 that\nsources with different X-ray emission mechanisms may be present\nin the sample. Due to the diverse nature of the sample, some systematic effects may be present that we have not accounted for. In\nthe context of this paper, however, a reduction to the more homogeneous low-luminosity sample (also used by Falcke et al. 2004)\nshows identical results.\nb) The X-ray spectral characteristics of XRBs change as they\nchange state, and the radio and X-ray band vary on different time\nscales and with respective phase lags. This specifically affects the\nglobal spectral index. The same should hold for AGNs, though it\nis difficult to test due to the long time scales involved. However,\nas long as there is a simple delay between the two bands and no\nsystematic trend for one band (X-ray or radio) to be in a specific\nstate longer than the other, the variability should average out in a\nlarge enough sample and be simply another source of scatter in the\nfundamental plane. The presence of the radio-X-ray correlation in\nXRBs in GX 339-4 (Corbel et al. 2003) and V404 Cyg (Gallo et al.\n2003) indicates that variability effects do not destroy the correlation\nat least in the case of XRBs. It has to be kept in mind that the error\nbars on some of the \u03b1x measurements from the literature shown in\nFig. 2 are very large. Clearly, future observations with tighter error\nbars will be very helpful to strengthen the arguments made in this\npaper.\nc) The same holds for the radio spectral index: it is known that as\na the source flux changes in XRBs, \u03b1r also varies by significant\namounts. However, at least for AGNs we know that, on average, a\nflat spectrum is a good description of the radio core, and while the\nsituation for XRBs at very low luminosities should be explored further, it is probably a good approximation to assume that the spectra\nare, on average, close to flat (Fender 2001). Again, the radio-Xray correlation indicates that the underlying spectrum is unlikely to\n\n5\n\nThe fact that both populations follow very similar correlations between\nLr and Lx for a fixed mass bin would be a consequence of the fact that\nthe predicted scaling relations from Heinz & Sunyaev (2003) are relatively\nsimilar for inefficient disk X-rays and uncooled synchrotron X-rays from\nthe jet.\n\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nWe presented an extension of the scale invariance formalism derived by Heinz & Sunyaev (2003) that takes the effects of radiative cooling into account self-consistently. The spectral index information of the sources contributing to the \"fundamental plane\"\ncorrelation shows that the X-ray luminosity of the sources should\nbe affected by cooling if it is due to synchrotron emission from\nthe jet. We proved that, for the canonical synchrotron parameters\n(p = 2, \u2206\u03b1 = 1/2), the scaling relations for X-ray and radio\nsynchrotron emission cannot reproduce the correlation coefficients\nfound by Merloni et al. (2003).\nFitting the newly derived scaling relations to the fundamental\nplane data, we showed that steep (p \u223c 3.4, \u03b1x \u223c 1.2), unbroken\nspectra are required to reproduce the correlation coefficients. Such\nsteep spectra are inconsistent with the observed mean and median\nspectral index of the \"fundamental plane\" sources with measured\nspectra. This seeming discrepancy leads us to propose three alternative scenarios: a) The X-rays are of synchrotron origin and the\nentire electron spectrum has a steep index of order \u223c 3, which\nwould require steep injection spectra or inverse Compton cooling\nof the entire powerlaw distribution of electrons to well below radio frequencies. However, such steep spectra are inconsistent with\nthe observed range in X-ray spectral indices \u03b1x ; b) the X-rays are\ndue to synchrotron emission from jets, but some of the assumptions made in deriving the scale invariance predictions fail (i.e.,\nsome aspect of jet dynamics is not scale invariant); c) the X-rays\nfrom a sizeable fraction of the sources in the sample are not of jetsynchrotron origin and are thus most likely emitted either by the\naccretion flow itself or as Compton up-scattered radiation from the\njet. It still plausible that a fraction of the sources (e.g., most of the\nXRBs) in the sample emit predominantly synchrotron X-rays and\nthat synchrotron emission from jets contributes a small fraction to\nthe X-ray spectrum of most sources.\nThe analysis presented in this paper shows how a statistical\nanalysis of radio and X-ray luminosities of a sample of black holes\ncan be used to constrain the X-ray emission mechanism of accreting black holes and to test the scale invariance hypothesis of jets. A\nmore refined sample of black holes with a better understanding of\nthe sources of scatter (and the selection effects involved), and with\ntighter limits on the X-ray spectral indices is necessary to take this\nanalysis to a more precise quantitative level.\n\nWe would like to thank Sera Markoff, Andrea Merloni, Mike\nNowak, and Rashid Sunyaev for helpful discussions.

We refer the reader to \u00a72 for the set of assumptions going\ninto the scale invariance ansatz. Again, we assume that the particles\nare injected into the jet at some scale invariant location r0 and time\nt0 (the latter measured in the jet frame).\nThe kinetic equation describing the evolution of the particle\ndistribution function f (\u03b3) as a function of time t and particle energy \u03b3 is (adapted from Coleman & Bicknell 1988):\nd ln (\u03c1)\n\u2202f\n+\n\u2202t\ndt\n\n\u0014\n\n2 \u2202 \u03b32f\n\u0001\n2e4 hB\u22a5\ni\n\u03b33 \u2202\n\u03b3 \u22122 f =\n3 \u2202\u03b3\n3m3e c5\n\u2202\u03b3\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0001\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere an isotropic pitch angle distribution of the particles was assumed for the numerical coefficients (this assumption is not critical\nfor the derivation, since the relevant numerical coefficients don't\nenter into the scaling relations). Eq. (A1) can be easily expanded\nto include inverse Compton losses by adding a term proportional to\nthe radiation energy density to the right hand side of eq. (A1).\nFor mathematical convenience, we substitute\n\u03b3\u0302 \u2261 (\u03c10 /\u03c1)1/3 \u03b3\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere \u03c10 \u2261 \u03c1(t0 ) is the density at the point \u03c70 = r0 /rg where\nthe particles were accelerated/injected, and t\u0303 \u2261 t/t0 is the time\nwhen the particles are injected (measured in the jet frame). We also\nsubstitute f \u0303 \u2261 (\u03c1/\u03c10 )\u22122/3 f .\nAs plasma travels along the jet, there is a one-to-one relation\nbetween its jet coordinate \u03c7 and the time t\u0303, defined by\nd\u03c7\nt0 c\nt0\n\u03c8\u03b2\u0393 (\u03c7)\n= c\u03b2\u0393 =\nrg\nrg\ndt\u0303\n\n(A3)\n\nWe define \u03c70 as the acceleration location such that t\u0303(\u03c70 ) = 1. By\nvirtue of the assumption that the particle injection location is scale\ninvariant, this value of \u03c70 must be independent of M and \u1e41. We\ncan then substitute the integration over t\u0303 by one over \u03c7.\nThe characteristic equation for synchrotron and adiabatic\nlosses for each particle implicit in eq.

(A15)\n\u2022 The low energy cutoff enters into the boundaries of the integral over \u03b3\u0303. However, since we are dealing with optically thin\nsynchrotron radiation at high frequencies (X-rays), the low energy\ncutoff has a negligible effect on the integral, since the synchrotron\nkernel drops exponentially at low particle energies and the integral\nconverges even if the lower bound is placed at zero, which we have\ndone in eq. (A15).\n\u2022 As a function of \u03bd\u0303, the integrand is entirely independent of\nM and \u1e41, which enter only into \u03c6B , \u03c6C , and \u03c6\u03be in front of the\nintegral. However, \u03bd\u0303 does depend on M and \u1e41 through \u03c6B and\n\u03c6C .\n\u2022 As discussed earlier, \u03c6B and \u03c6C are simply the magnetic field\nstrength B and the normalization C of the particle distribution at\nthe base of the jet (both of which vary with M and \u1e41), whereas \u03c6\u03be\ndescribes how the cutoff energy \u03b3c at a given position \u03c7 depends on\nM and \u1e41, as defined in eq. (A7). The fact that we can write down\na simple dependence of \u03b3c on M and \u1e41 will allow us below to set\nthe cooled synchrotron flux in relation to M and \u1e41 as well.\n\n9\n\nEqs. (8) and (9), as derived in the appendix, are independent of what\nthe actual X-ray spectral shape is6 . However, observations of synchrotron spectra from sources where we know cooling is efficient\nshow either exponential-type cutoffs or, if fresh plasma is continuously supplied, broken powerlaw spectra. The latter case is appropriate here, since we are observing a superposition of spectra from\nplasma that moves away from a stationary or quasi-stationary acceleration region. Therefore, we can expect the cooled X-ray spectrum\nto be of powerlaw type:\nFx \u221d M \u03bermxM \u1e41\u03bex\u1e41\n\n(A20)\n\nA3 Inverse Compton cooling\nIt is easy to change the cooling mechanism in eq. (A1) to inverse\nCompton cooling off of radiation from either the central accretion\ndisk or the microwave background. The latter will be entirely irrelevant in the context of core dominated jets and we will ignore it in\nthe following paragraph. The former can be included by substituting 8\u03c0 Urad for B\u22a5 2 in eq. (A1). In this case the function \u03c6\u03be will\nhave to be changed to reflect the dependence of the radiation energy\ndensity on M and \u1e41, which depends on the accretion\np scenario. In\nthe case of an efficient accretion disk with \u03c6B = \u1e41/M , we have\n\n\u03c6\u03be \u221d rg M \u22121 \u1e41\n\n(A21)\n\nwhich has exactly the same dependence on M and \u1e41 as in the\nsynchrotron loss case, and the solution is unchanged. In radiatively\ninefficient flows, we have approximately\n\u03c6\u03be \u221d rg M \u22121 \u1e412\n\n(A22)\n\nFollowing the same procedure as Heinz & Sunyaev (2003), we\nare now in a position to derive the scaling relation between the\nsynchrotron flux at X-ray energies F\u03bd and M :\n\nwhich implies that inverse Compton is increasingly unimportant\ncompared to synchrotron cooling at low accretion rates. It also implies that, while \u03bexM is unchanged, \u03bex\u1e41 is changed to\n\n\u2202 log M 3 \u03c6B \u03c6C \u03c6p\u22121\n\u2202 log F\u03bd\n\u2202 log F\u03bd \u2202 log \u03bd\u0303\n\u03be\n=\n+\n\u2202 log M\n\u2202 log M\n\u2202 log \u03bd\u0303 \u2202 log M\n\u2202 log (\u03c6B )\n\u2202 log (\u03c6C )\n+ (2p \u2212 1 \u2212 3\u03b1x )\n= 2 \u2212 2\u03b1x + p +\n\u2202 log M\n\u2202 log M\n\u2261 \u03bexM\n(A18)\n\n\u03bex\u1e41 = 2p \u2212 1/2 \u2212 3\u03b1x\n\n\u0001\n\nwhere we used the X-ray spectral index \u03b1x such that Fx \u221d \u03bd \u2212\u03b1x\nF\u03bd\n.\nor \u03b1x \u2261 \u2212 \u2202\u2202log\nlog \u03bd\nNote that eq.

These\ntwo equations are the scaling laws used throughout this paper\nThe superposition of cooled electron spectra from different regions in the jet might, in principle, produce any number of spectral shapes (e.g., broken powerlaws, cutoff, curved spectra, etc.).\n\n(A23)\n\nREFERENCES\nAchterberg, A., Gallant, Y.

(8) and (9) are then differential equations between\nF\u03bd and M and between F\u03bd and \u1e41. Solving them requires knowledge of\nthe synchrotron spectrum over a large enough frequency range to cover the\ndesired range in M and \u1e41.\n\n\f10\n\nS. Heinz\n\nGallant, Y.
