BORISOV\nAbstract. For every point on the Jacobian of the modular curve\nX0 (l) we define and study certain twisted holomorphic Eisenstein\nseries. These are particular cases of a more general notion of\ntwisted modular forms which correspond to sections on the modular curve X1 (l) of the degree zero twists of line bundles of usual\nmodular forms. We conjecture that a point on the Jacobian is rational if and only if the ratios of these twisted Eisenstein series of\nthe same weights have rational coefficients.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet X0 (l) denote the modular curve of level l. It is defined as the\ncompactification of the quotient of the upper half plane H by the group\n\u0010\n\u0011\na b\n\u03930 (l) which consists of matrices\n\u2208 SL2 (Z) with c \u2208 lZ. We\nc d\nare interested in the Jacobian of X0 (l). We associate to any point\nof this Jacobian a collection of holomorphic functions Ei,k;h (\u03c4 ) on the\nupper half plane H, which we call h-twisted Eisenstein series. Here\nk \u2265 3 is an integer, i \u2208 Z/lZ, and h = h(\u03c4 ) is a modular form of\nweight two for \u03930 (l) which is related to the point of the Jacobian by\nperiod integrals.\nMore specifically, to any weight two form h we associate a unitary\ncharacter of \u03930 (l) by\nZ \u2212d\n\u0010\n\u0011\nc\na b\n(1.1)\n7\u2192 exp(2\u03c0iR\nh(s) ds) .\nc d\ni\u221e\nThen we use this unitary character to modify a definition of some Eisenstein series. The unitarity of the character assures the convergence. It\nthen turns out that the character and the series depend only on the\npoint of the Jacobian, so one gets well-defined invariants of degree zero\ninvertible sheaves on X0 (l).\nThe author was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0140172.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLEV A. BORISOV\n\nWe remark that twisted Eisenstein series and modular forms of this\npaper should not be confused with twisted Eisenstein series of Goldfeld and Gunnells, see [Go] and [GG], which involve only an additive\nversion of the character (1.1). However, a nonholomorphic analog of\nthe Eisenstein series considered in this paper has already appeared in\n[P].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we define the Eisenstein series twisted by modular forms Ek,i;h (\u03c4 ) and prove their convergence. We use the Dirichlet summation trick to get a formula for the\nFourier coefficients of Ek,i;h . In Section 3 we define a more general class\nof functions, called h-twisted modular forms. The definition is parallel\nto that of the usual modular forms, except for the extra character (1.1).\nWe give a geometric interpretation of these twisted modular forms as\nsections of the twists of the line bundles of the usual modular forms on\nthe modular curves by degree zero line bundles, which justifies our terminology. Section 4 extends the Petersson inner product to the twisted\ncase. Section 5 contains the rationality Conjecture 5.1, as well as some\nhighly circumstantial evidence for it. Finally, in Section 6 we list the\nopen problems which currently by far outnumber the results.\nAcknowledgements. I thank Paul Gunnells and Gautam Chinta\nwho read the first version of the paper and suggested several useful\nreferences.\nThis paper is dedicated to the 60th birthday of Igor Dolgachev who\nwas my PhD advisor at the University of Michigan in 1993-1996. His\nlove of mathematics inspires everyone around him. It is also a safe bet\nthat he can pinpoint exactly which 19th century mathematician has\nalready proved all the results of this paper.\n2. Eisenstein series twisted by modular forms\nIn this section we introduce the main objects of interest. Let l > 0\nbe a positive integer, which will be fixed throughout the paper. We\nwill denote by \u03c4 the coordinate on P\nthe upper half plane H and will use\nn\nthe notation q = e2\u03c0i\u03c4 . Let h(\u03c4 ) = \u221e\nn=1 an q be a cusp\nR \u03c4 form of weight\ntwo for the congruence subgroup \u03930 (l). Let H(\u03c4 ) = i\u221e h(s) ds be the\nantiderivative of h.\nWe first define the auxiliary series \u00cak,\u03c7;h(\u03c4 ).\nDefinition 2.1. For a positive integer k, a character \u03c7 : (Z/lZ)\u2217 \u2192 C\nand h as above, we define h-twisted Eisenstein series by\nX\nd\n\u00cak,\u03c7;h(\u03c4 ) =\n(c\u03c4 + d)\u2212k \u03c7(d)e2\u03c0iRH(\u2212 c ) .\n\u0393\u221e \\\u03930 (l)\n\n\fHOLOMORPHIC EISENSTEIN SERIES WITH JACOBIAN TWISTS\n\n3\n\nHere \u0393\u221e is the infinite cyclic subgroup generated by \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4 + 1.\nRemark 2.2. In Definition 2.1 and throughout the rest of the paper\nwe use the convention H(\u2212 d0 ) = 0. It is motivated by the fact that \u2212 dc\n+b\n. So if c = 0, this preimage\nis the preimage of \u03c4 = i\u221e under \u03c4 \u2192 a\u03c4\nc\u03c4 +d\nis i\u221e, and H(i\u221e) = 0 by the definition.\nWe can reformulate the above series as follows. The cosets of \u03930 (l)\nover \u0393\u221e are given by pairs of integers (c, d) with c \u2261 0 modl and\ngcd(c, d) = 1. Hence, we have\nX\nX\nd\n\u00cak,\u03c7;h (\u03c4 ) =\n(c\u03c4 + d)\u2212k \u03c7(d)e2\u03c0iRH(\u2212 c ) .\nc\u2208lZ d\u2208Z,gcd(c,d)=1\n\nWe will be actually interested in a slight variation of this series, which\nis defined below.\nDefinition 2.3. We define\nX\nX\nEk,i;h (\u03c4 ) =\n\ndi\n\nd\n\n(c\u03c4 + d)\u2212k e\u22122\u03c0i l e2\u03c0iRH(\u2212 c ) .\n\nc\u2208lZ d\u2208Z,gcd(l,d)=1\n\nProposition 2.4. For k \u2265 3, the series Ek,i;h(\u03c4 ) and \u00cak,\u03c7;h (\u03c4 ) absolutely converge to holomorphic functions on the upper half plane.\nP\nProof. The series of absolute values is (c,d)\u2208Z2 \u2212(0,0) |c\u03c4 + d|\u2212k . It has\n\u2264 (const)R terms with |c\u03c4 + d| \u2208 [R, R + 1). Absolute convergence\non compacts is also clear, which implies that the resulting sum is holomorphic.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.5. Proposition 2.4 just barely fails for k = 2 and fails quite\nmiserably for k = 1, which is perhaps the case of most interest.\nBy splitting the series Ek,i;h according to gcd(c, d) we observe that\nit is a linear combination of series of type \u00ca with coefficients that\ninvolve the values of Dedekind L-functions at k as well as Gauss sums.\nTo write it out explicitly, let us denote by \u03c71 , . . . , \u03c7\u03c6(l) the characters\n(Z/lZ)\u2217 \u2192 C.\nProposition 2.6. For k \u2265 3 there holds\n\u03c6(l)\n1 X \u0010 X \u22122\u03c0i ti \u22121 \u0011\nl \u03c7\nEk,i;h (\u03c4 ) =\ne\nj (t) L(\u03c7j , k)\u00cak,\u03c7j ;h (\u03c4 )\n\u03c6(l) j=1\n\u2217\nt\u2208(Z/lZ)\n\nwhere L(\u03c7, k) denotes the value of the Dedekind L-function at k, and\n\u03c6 is the Euler function.\n\n\f4\n\nLEV A.

The terms with c = 0 correspond to the q 0 term. Here we use\nthe convention H(\u2212 d0 ) = 0 of Remark 2.2.\nFor a given value of c > 0, the possible values of d are given by\nd = d0 + nc with 0 < d0 < c, gcd(d0, l) = 1 and n \u2208 Z. For each d0\nthe value of RH(\u2212 dc ) is independent of n. Indeed, one easily sees that\nH(\u03c4 + 1) = H(\u03c4 ), since h(\u03c4 ) was a cusp form.

Since the space of\nEisenstein series has a basis whose elements have all Fourier coefficients\n1\nin Q, the q 0 coefficients of (2\u03c0i)\nk Ek,i;0 are rational as well.

It is conceivable that this series will converge absolutely, at least\nfor k = 2. Indeed, for small h the values of the sums may be close to\nthose for h = 0 where all but a finite number are zero. But this is\ndefinitely not a proof.

Twisted modular forms\nIn this section we put the definition of the h-twisted Eisenstein series\ninto a more general context of the h-twisted modular forms. We denote\nby X0 (l) and X1 (l) the modular curves for the congruence subgroups\n\u03930 (l) and \u03931 (l). The group \u03931 (l) is the subgroup of \u03930 (l) whose diagonal\nelements are 1 modl.\nDefinition 3.1.

For k \u2265 3, the functions Ek,i;h(\u03c4 ) and \u00cak,\u03c7;h(\u03c4 ) are\nh-twisted modular form of weight k for \u03931 (l).\nProof. We will first check the transformation properties of Ek,i;h (\u03c4 )\n+b\nunder \u03c4 \u2192 a\u03c4\n. If the sum in the definition of Ek,i;h is taken over\nc\u03c4 +d\n+b\n(c1 , d1 ), then we can rewrite the sum for Ek,i;h( a\u03c4\n) in terms of the\nc\u03c4 +d\nsum over (c2 , d2 ) = (c1 a + d1 c, c1 b + d1 d) as\nEk,i;h (\n\nX\na\u03c4 + b\n)=\nc\u03c4 + d\nc \u2208lZ\n2\n\nX\n\n(c2 \u03c4 + d2 )\u2212k (c\u03c4 + d)k e\u22122\u03c0i\n\nd1 i\nl\n\nd\n\n2\u03c0iRH(\u2212 c1 )\n\ne\n\n1\n\n.\n\nd2 \u2208Z,\n\ngcd(d2 ,l)=1\n\nWe notice that d1 \u2261 d2 modl, so the first exponential term equals\nd2 i\ne\u22122\u03c0i l .

The argument for Ek,i;h follows that of Proposition 3.2.

We notice that \u00cak,\u03c7;h have nebentypus \u03c7.\nc d\nRemark 3.5. We will call the nebentypus \u03c7 = 1 the h-twisted \u03930 (l)\nmodular forms. For example, Ek,0;h (\u03c4 ) is one such form for k \u2265 3. As\nin the usual case, the action of \u22121 \u2208 \u03930 (l) causes the spaces of odd\nweight to be zero.\nIt is clear that for a given h, the space of h-twisted modular forms\nfor \u03931 (l) is a graded module over the ring of modular forms for \u03931 (l).\nIn what follows we give a geometric interpretation of this space. We\ncan safely assume l \u2265 3 so the action of \u03931 (l) on the upper half plane\nis free. We denote by X1 (l) the corresponding modular curve which\nis obtained by the compactification of its open subset H/\u03931 (l). There\nis a line bundle L of weight one modular forms on X1 (l), such that\nthe space Mk (\u03931 (l)) of usual modular forms of weight k is naturally\nidentified with the space of global sections H 0 (X1 (l), L\u2297k ).\nProposition 3.6. For each h there is a degree zero invertible F = F(h)\nsuch that the space of weight k h-twisted modular forms of level n is\nnaturally identified with H 0 (X1 (l), F \u2297 L\u2297k ).\nProof. For an h-twisted modular form f we define the order of zero of\nf at a cusp to be the exponent in the corresponding Fourier expansion.\nCombined with the zeroes in the open set H/\u03931 (l), they give a divisor\non X1 (l) which we denote by Div(f ).\nWe observe that the divisor class of Div(f ) depends only on h and\n(\u03c4 )\nk. Indeed, the ratio f (\u03c4 ) = ff21 (\u03c4\nof two weight k h-twisted modular\n)\nforms is a \u03931 (l) modular function. It remains to observe that Div(f ) =\n\n\f10\n\nLEV A. BORISOV\n\nDiv(f1 ) \u2212 Div(f2 ). More generally, for h-twisted forms fi of weights\nki one has Div(f1 ) \u2212 Div(f2 ) \u223c (k1 \u2212 k2 )Div(L) where Div(L) is the\ndivisor of any (meromorphic) modular form of weight 1. We define F\nas the invertible sheaf that corresponds to Div(E4,0;h ) \u2212 Div(E4,0;0 ).\nEvery h-twisted modular form of weight k gives a global section of\nF \u2297 L\u2297k . Conversely, given a global section of F \u2297 L\u2297k , one can write\nit as a product of E4,0;h (\u03c4 ) and a modular function on X1 (l). This\nproduct is easily seen to be a holomorphic function on H that satisfies\nthe definition of the h-twisted modular form of weight k.\nIt remains to see that the degree of F is zero. Consider a ratio of an\nh-twisted and a usual form of the same weight k, which we can assume\nto be nonzero at the cusps. It is a meromorphic function g(\u03c4 ) on the\nupper half plane, which is bounded at the cusps. To find the number of\nits zeroes and poles in the fundamental domain, one needs to integrate\nto find the sum of residues of d log g(\u03c4 ) in it. Transformation properties\nof g imply that d log g(\u03c4 ) is a meromorphic differential form on X1 (l).\nConsequently, the sum of its residues is zero, which leads to deg F = 0,\nas desired.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.7. In the notations above, the invertible sheaf F(h) is\ninvariant under the action of \u03930 (l)/\u03931 (l). Moreover, it admits a natural\nlinearization for this action.\nProof. The key point here is that h(\u03c4 ) was a \u03930 (l) modular form. The\nlinearization is provided by the action of \u03930 (l)/\u03931 (l) from Remark 3.4.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.8. We may as well talk about the invertible sheaf F0 =\nF0 (h) of degree zero on the modular curve X0 (l). It can be either\ndefined as the \u03930 (l)/\u03931 (l)-invariant part of the pushforward \u03c0\u2217 F for\nthe quotient map \u03c0 : X1 (l) \u2192 X0 (l), or as a sheaf that corresponds to\nthe divisor Div(E4,0;h ) \u2212 Div(E4,0;0 ) on X0 (l). We have \u03c0 \u2217 F0 \u223c\n= F.\nRemark 3.9. The operation of tensoring by an invertible sheaf is commonly referred to as twisting, which justifies our terminology. Unfortunately, this term is already used in [GG] in the context of Eisenstein\nseries. We hope that this does not lead to a confusion, since the series\nwe construct in this paper are quite different from those in [GG].\nTheorem 3.10. Any degree zero invertible sheaf F0 on X0 (l) is isomorphic to F0 (h) of Remark 3.8 for some weight two \u03930 (l) cusp form\nh.\nProof. The map h 7\u2192 F0 (h) can be described in terms of the periods.\nLet r be the genus of X0 (l), which we assume to be positive. Denote\n\n\fHOLOMORPHIC EISENSTEIN SERIES WITH JACOBIAN TWISTS\n\n11\n\nby KX0 (l) the sheaf of holomorphic 1-forms on X0 (l). The Jacobian of\nX0 (l) is isomorphic to the quotient of Cr = H 0 (X0 (l), KX0 (l) )\u2228 by the\nlattice of periods, defined as the image of H1 (X0 (l), Z) via integration,\nsee [GH]. We would like to calculate the point of the Jacobian that\ncorresponds to F0 (h) in these terms. This means that for any g \u2208\nH 0 (X0 (l), KX0 (l) ) we would like to find the integral of g from zeroes of\nsome h-twisted weight k form fh to zeroes of some usual weight k form\nf , up to the lattice of periods.\nBy an easy Riemann-Roch calculation, we can safely assume that fh\nand f do not vanish at the extra symmetry points or cusps, where by\n2\u03c0i/3\nextra symmetry points we mean\nR \u03c4 those that are equivalent to i or e\nmodulo SL2 (Z). Let G(\u03c4 ) = i\u221e g(s) ds be an antiderivative of g.

Pick a point p \u2208 X0 (l)\nand cut X0 (l) to represent it by a 4r-gon with pairs of sides identified in\nthe usual manner, such that all vertices map to p. We will assume that\nthe cusps, the points of extra symmetry, as well as the zeroes of fh and\nf lie in the interior of this polygon. We will draw cuts from a vertex of\nthe 4r-gon to the cusps and extra symmetry points, see Figure 1. We\ncan represent the resulting 4r-gon without these extra cuts by a region\nin the upper half plane by picking a preimage of a point in the middle\nand extending all the paths from it by continuity. This will have an\neffect of opening up the cuts to the cusps and to those extra symmetry\n\n\f12\n\nLEV A.

The if part is clear, since in this case the Eisenstein series are\nidentical.\nTo see the only if part, we observe that in the proof of Theorem\n3.10, the sheaf F is given by a linear combination of the periods with\nd\u02c6\ncoefficients RH(\u2212 \u0109jj ), j = 1, . . . , 2r.

An easy application of the Riemann-Roch theorem\nshows that the dimension of the space of h-twisted modular forms of\nweight k \u2265 2 coincides with that of the space of usual modular forms\nof weight k. This holds for either \u03930 (l) or \u03931 (l), as well as for any\nnebentypus.\n4.

It is clear that the above defined Petersson pairing restricts to a nondegenerate Hermitean form on the space of h-twisted\ncusp forms.\nThe following proposition extends the orthogonality of Eisenstein\nseries and cusp forms (see [L]) to the h-twisted case, for the particular\nclass of Eisenstein series considered in this paper.\nProposition 4.5. For k \u2265 3 we have\nhEk,i;h, gi = 0\nfor any weight k h-twisted cusp form g for \u03931 (l).\nProof. It is enough to check that h\u00cak,\u03c7;h, gi = 0 for all characters \u03c7 :\n(Z/lZ)\u2217 \u2192 C\u2217 . We can also assume that g is an eigenform for \u03930 -action,\nas in Remark 3.4. Denote the character of g by \u03c8. We have\nZ\nX\nd\nh\u00cak,\u03c7;h, gi =\n(c\u03c4 + d)\u2212k \u03c7(d)e2\u03c0iRH(\u2212 c ) g(\u03c4 )y k\u22122 dxdy.\n\u03931 (l)\\H \u0393 \\\u0393 (l)\n\u221e\n0\n\nWe switch the order of integration and summation and then switch\nto a different domain for each term.

Indeed, we have H(i\u221e) = 0, which implies that g(\u03c4 +\n1) = g(\u03c4 ), and the g(i\u221e) = 0 follows from g being a cusp form.\n\u0003\n5. Rationality conjecture\nThe motivation behind our investigation of twisted Eisenstein series\nis that they might provide a tool for studying the Jacobian of the modular curve X0 (l). We now recall that X0 (l) comes equipped with the\nnatural Q-structure, which then gives a Q-structure on its Jacobian.\nThe following conjecture relates the rationality of the coefficients of\ntwisted Eisensten series and the rationality of the point on the Jacobian.\nConjecture 5.1. The sheaf F0 (h) on X0 (l) gives a rational point on\nthe Jacobian if and only if for each k there exists a nonzero formal\npower series Rk (q) such that all coefficients of the q-series Ek,i;h Rk (q)\nare rational for all i. Equivalently, the ratios of Ek,i;h and Ek,j;h have\nrational Fourier coefficients for all k, i and j, provided Ek,j;h 6\u2261 0.\nRemark 5.2. A stronger version of Conjecture 5.1 would require Rk =\nRk for some series R = R(q).\nWe devote the remainder of the section to the evidence in favor of\nConjecture 5.1. Since the evidence is mostly circumstantial anyway, we\nwill be somewhat sketchy and leave the details to the reader.\nFirst of all, the if part of the conjecture holds up to a finite index\nsubgroup as long as Ek,i;h do not have common zeroes for some k > 0.\nIndeed, the existence of Rk implies that the module over the ring of\n\u03931 (l) modular forms which is generated by Ek,i;h is defined over Q. By\nthe usual correspondence between graded modules and sheaves we see\nthat the invertible sheaf F(h)\u2297L\u2297k is defined over Q. Since L is defined\nover Q, we see that the invertible sheaf F(h) on X1 (l) is defined over\nQ. Denote \u03c0 : X1 (l) \u2192 X0 (l) and recall that F(h) = \u03c0 \u2217 F0 (h). Then\n\u03c6(l)/2\n\nF0\n\nis defined over Q.\n\n\u223c\n= (\u039b\u03c6(l)/2 \u03c0\u2217 F(h)) \u2297 (\u039b\u03c6(l)/2 \u03c0\u2217 \u03c0 \u2217 O)\u22121\n\n\fHOLOMORPHIC EISENSTEIN SERIES WITH JACOBIAN TWISTS\n\n17\n\nFor the only if part of the conjecture, observe that it holds for h = 0,\nin view of Remark 2.10. In general, for every rational point on the Jacobian of X1 (l) that corresponds to a sheaf F = \u03c0 \u2217 F0 , the space of\nglobal sections H 0 (F \u2297 L\u2297k ) has a basis that is defined over Q. The\nessence of the Conjecture 5.1 is that the h-twisted Eisenstein series\nEk,i;h are rational linear combinations of the basis elements. Since q 0\ncoefficients and the \u03930 (l)/\u03931 (l) transformation properties of Ek,i;h are\nindependent of the twisting, if the linear span of Ek,i;h is defined over\nrationals, then so are the individual elements, at least in the case of\nprime l. Indeed, one can show that in this case the matrix of q 0 coefficients of \u03930 (l)/\u03931 (l)-translates of Ek,i is nondegenerate and rational.\nConsequently, if Span(Ek,i;h ) has a rational basis, Ek,i;h have rational\ncoefficients in it.\nUnfortunately, it is not at all obvious that Span(Ek,i;h ) is defined\nover Q. The space of all h-twisted forms of weight k splits up as a\ndirect sum of the space of cusp forms and its orthogonal complement\nunder the Petersson pairing. One can hope that this splitting respects\nthe rational structures. In the case of prime l, the series Ek,i;h (\u03c4 )\nroughly account for half the dimension of this orthogonal complement.\nHowever, if one could define Ek,i;h(\u03c4 ) for weight k = 1, then one would\nexpect that all weight one h-twisted modular forms lie in Span(Ek,i;h ),\nby an application of Riemann-Roch formula.\nOn the plus side, it is quite easy to give a sufficient condition that\n1\nassures that the Fourier coefficients of (2\u03c0i)\nk Ek,i;h are real. Recall that\nan R-structure on the modular curve is given by the involution that\nsends h(\u03c4 ) to h(\u2212\u03c4\u0304 ). Let us calculate Ek,i;h (\u2212\u03c4\u0304 ).\nProposition 5.3. Let g = h(\u2212\u03c4 ). For k \u2265 3 one has\nEk,i;h (\u2212\u03c4\u0304 ) = (\u22121)k Ek,i;g (\u03c4 )\nR\u03c4\nProof. and let G be the antiderivative i\u221e g(s) ds of g. Observe that\nH(\u2212\u03c4\u0304 ) = \u2212G(\u03c4 ). We have\nX\nX\nd\ndi\nEk,i;h (\u2212\u03c4\u0304 ) =\n(\u2212c\u03c4 + d)\u2212k e2\u03c0i l e\u22122\u03c0iRH(\u2212 c )\nc\u2208lZ d\u2208Z,gcd(l,d)=1\n\n=\n\nX\n\nX\n\ndi\n\nd\n\n(\u2212c\u03c4 + d)\u2212k e2\u03c0i l e2\u03c0iRG( c ) = Ek,\u2212i;g (\u03c4 )\n\nc\u2208lZ d\u2208Z,gcd(l,d)=1\n\nwhere we have switched from c to \u2212c in the summation. It remains\nto observe Ek,\u2212i;g = (\u22121)k Ek,i;g , in view of the change from (c, d) to\n(\u2212c, \u2212d) in the summation.\n\u0003\n\n\f18\n\nLEV A. BORISOV\n\nCorollary 5.4.

Open problems\nThere are numerous open problems, whose solution would greatly\nenhance the understanding of the h-twisted modular forms. We list\nseveral of them.\n\u2022 Can one efficiently calculate Fourier coefficients of an h-twisted\nEisenstein series? The problem is that the definition only provides a relatively slowly convergent series. Lack of explicit coefficients makes it impossible to do any kind of computer experiments to uncover relations among the series or to test Conjecture 5.1.\n\u2022 Can one define h-twisted Eisenstein series for weights k = 1\nor 2? What will happen to their modularity properties? The\nsimilar question in the untwisted case is answered by looking\nat the Fourier expansions, but this approach seems to fail in\ngeneral.\n\u2022 In the untwisted case, these Eisenstein series can be constructed\nfrom logarithmic derivatives of the theta function, see [BG1].\nIs there a twisted analog of the theta function, with the same\nproperties? In a related comment, the notion of h-twisting can\nbe extended to the Jacobi forms.\n\u2022 Do any twisted forms have nice infinite product expansions?\n\u2022 What is the meaning of Hecke operators in this setting? It is\neasy to see that the usual definition of the Hecke operators does\nnot produce operators on the spaces of h-twisted forms. Also,\nif h is a Hecke eigenform, does this lead to any properties of htwisted forms? A related question is what should be the analog\nof Dirichlet series and Euler expansions in the h-twisted case.\n\u2022 What is the meaning of the Fricke involution in this setting?\n\u2022 What would be an analog of Rankin-Selberg method for the\nPetersson inner product of a usual cusp form and product of two\ntwisted Eisenstein series of opposite twists? The argument of\nProposition 4.5 shows that the unfolding trick generally works,\nbut the lack of Euler expansions is a major hindrance.\n\u2022 Is it possible to see what the twisted Eisenstein series are in the\ncase of the divisors coming from the Heegner points?\n\n\fHOLOMORPHIC EISENSTEIN SERIES WITH JACOBIAN TWISTS\n\n19\n\n\u2022 What is the relation between the Eisenstein series of opposite\ntwists?\n\u2022 In the untwisted case, there are quadratic relations on the Eisenstein series that mimic the relations on modular symbols. Is\nthere any analog of such relations in the twisted case? For instance, dimension counts show that there are a lot of linear relations between products of h-twisted and untwisted Eisenstein\nseries. Can one write at least some of them explicitly? Together\nwith the rationality conjecture, this might provide an approach\nto the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, see [T], although at\nthis point in time this is, at best, a very long shot.\nReferences\n[BG1] L.
