Space and time (and weather)\nlimit its content. Much of what is found here can rather be considered to result\nfrom a biased view point or attitude and limited understanding of the author\nfrustrated because the developments of what he thought was a science (meteorology) turns out to be unsatisfactory to him and sometimes misleading.\nIt seems that other approaches might be thought of. New implementations\ncarried forward. Some are surely made and understood by meteorologists but\nare not easily available in usual physics literature. Thus the lines below may\nbe rather addressed to physicists. The paper will be satisfactory if it attracts\nwork toward a huge field of interest with many many publications still with\nmany unanswered questions. As an immediate warning it is emphasized that\ndeep corrections to standard models or actual findings can NOT be found here\nnor are even suggested. Only to be found is a set of basic considerations and\nreflections expecting to give lines of various investigations, and hope for some\nscientific aspects of meteorology in the spirit of modern statistical physics\nideas.\nA historical point is in order. The author came into this subject starting\nfrom previous work in econophysics, when he observed that some \"weather\nderivatives\" were in use, and some sort of game initiated by the Frankfurt\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse1 in order to attract customers which could predict the temperature in various cities within a certain lapse of time, and win some prize\nthereafter1 . This subject therefore was obviously similar to predicting the\n\n1A\n\ncommon measure of temperature has arisen from the market : the degree-day. The Heating\n\nDegree Day is a (loose) measure of how much heating is needed. For a given day, HDD is equal\nto the larger of Max [0, 18\u25e6 C - daily average temperature]. The Cooling Degree Day (CDD) is a\n(loose) measure of how much cooling is needed: CDD = Max[0, daily average temperature - 18\u25e6 C].\n\n2\n\n\fS&P500 or other financial index values at a certain future time. Whence\nvarious techniques which were used in econophysics, like the detrended fluctuation analysis, the multifractals, the moving average crossing techniques,\netc. could be attempted from scratch.\nBeside the weather (temperature) derivatives other effects are of interest.\nClimate is said to be fast changing nowadays. Much is said and written about\ne.g. the ozone layer and the Kyoto \"agreement\". The El Ni\u00f1o system is a\ngreat challenge to scientists. Since there is some data available under the form\nof time series, like the Southern Oscillation Index, it is of interest to look for\ntrends, coherent structures, periods, correlations in noise, etc. in order to\nbring some knowledge, if possible basic parameters, to this meteorological\nfield and expect to import some modern statistical physics ideas into such\nclimatological phenomena.\nIt appeared that other data are available like those obtained under various experiments, put into force by various agencies, like the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) for ocean surfaces or those of the\nAtmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) of the US Department\nof Energy, among others. Much data is about cloud structure, e.g the cloud\nbase height evolution, on liquid water paths, brightness temperature, ...; they\ncan often freely downloaded from the web. Therefore many time series can\nbe analyzed.\nHowever it appeared that the data is sometimes of rather limited value\nbecause of the lack of precision, or are biased because the raw data is already\ntransformed through models, and arbitrarily averaged (\"filtered\") whence\n\nThis notion seems to be a measure that the energy suppliers could use to hedge their supply in\nadverse temperature conditions.\n\n3\n\n\feven sometimes lacking the meaning it should contain. Therefore a great\nchallenge comes through in order to sort out the wheat from the chaff in\norder to develop meaningful studies.\nIn Sect.2, I will comment on the history of meteorology, observe that the\nevolution of such an old science is slow and limited by various a priori factors. Some basic recall on clouds and their role on climate and weather will\nbe made (Sect.3). This should remind us that the first modern ideas of statistical physics were implemented on cloud studies through fractal geometry.\nIndeed, modern and pioneering work on clouds is due to Lovejoy who looked at\nthe perimeter-area relationship of rain and cloud areas2 , fractal dimension of\ntheir shape or ground projection. He discovered the statistical self-similarity\nof cloud boundaries through area-perimeter analyses of the geometry from\nsatellite pictures. He found the fractal dimension Dp \u2243 4/3 over a spectrum\nof 4 orders of magnitude in size, for small fair weather cumuli (\u223c 1021 km)\nup to huge stratus fields (\u223c 103 km). Occasional scale breaks have been\nreported3,4 due to variations in cloudiness. Cloud size distributions have also\nbeen studied from a scaling point of view. It is hard to say whether there is\nperfect scaling5\u20137 ; why should there be scaling ?\nI will point out, as others do, the basic well known pioneering work of\nmodern essence, like the Lorenz model. It was conceived in order to induce\npredictability, but it turned out rather to be the basic nonlinear dynamical\nsystem describing chaotic behavior. However this allows for bringing up to\nits level the notion of fractal ideas for meteorology work, thus scaling laws,\nand modern data analysis techniques. I will recall most of the work to which\nI have contributed, being aware that I am failing to acknowledge many more\nimportant reports than those, - for what I deeply apologize.\nThere is a quite positive view of mine however. Even though the techniques have not yet brought up many codes implemented in weather and cli-\n\n4\n\n\fmate evolution prediction, it was recently stressed8 in a sarcastic way (\"Chaos\n: useful at last?\") that some applications of nonlinear dynamics ideas are finding their way onto weather prediction9 , even though it has to be said that\nthere is much earlier work on the subject10 .\nThere are (also) very interesting lecture notes on the web for basic modules on meteorological training courses, e.g. one available through ECMWF\nwebsite11 . But I consider that beyond the scientifically sound and highly\nsophisticated computer models, there is still space for simple technical and\nuseful approaches, based on standard statistical physics techniques and ideas,\nin particular based on the scaling hypothesis for phase transitions12 and percolation theory features13 . These constraint allow me to shorten the reference\nlist ! A few examples will be found in Sect. 4.\nAt the end of this introduction, I would crown the paper with references\nto two outstanding scientists. First let me recall Friedmann2 who said that\n\"if you can't be a good mathematician, you try to become a good physicist,\nand those who can't become meteorologists\". Another, Heisenberg was surely\naware about errors and prediction difficulties resulting from models.3 Both\nmen should be guiding us to new endeavors with modesty anyway.\n\n2 A.\n\nFriedmann (1888-1925) had a bad experience with his ideas, e.g. rejected by Einstein. \"Thus\"\n\nin July 1925 Friedmann made a record-breaking ascent in a balloon to 7400 meters to make meteorological and medical observations. Near the end of August 1925 Friedmann began to feel unwell.\nHe was diagnosed as having typhoid and taken to hospital where he died two weeks later. He never\nbecame a sociologist.\n3 W.\n\nHeisenberg (1901-1976) had much difficulty to get his Ph.D. at TU Munchen because he was\n\nnot a good experimentalist!\n\n5\n\n\fII. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION\n\nFrom the beginning of times, the earth, sky, weather have been of great\nconcern. As soon as agriculture, commerce, travelling on land and sea prevailed, men have wished to predict the weather. Later on airborne machines\nneed atmosphere knowledge and weather predictions for best flying. Nowadays there is much money spent on weather predictions for sport activities. It\nis known how the knowledge of weather (temperature, wind, humidity, ..) is\nrelevant, (even f undamental !), e.g. in sailing races or in Formula 1 and car\nrally races. Let it be recalled the importance of knowing and predicting the\nwind (strength and directions), pressure and temperature at high altitude for\nthe (recent) no-stop balloon round the world trip.\nA long time ago, druids and other priests were the up-to-date meteorologists. It is known that many proverbs on weather derive from farmer\nobservations, - one of the most precise ones reads (in french) \"Apr\u00e8s la pluie,\nle beau temps\", which is (still) correct, in spite of the Heisenberg principle,\nand modern scientific advances.\nAfter land travel and commerce, the control of the seas was of great importance for economic, whence political reasons. Therefore there is no surprise\nin the fact that at the time of a British Empire, and the Dutch-SpanishPortuguese rivalry the first to draw sea wind maps was Halley14 . That followed the \"classical\" isobaths and isoheights (these are geometrical measures\n!!!) for sailors needing to go through channels. Halley, having also invented\nthe isogons (lines of equal magnetic fields) drew in ca. 1701, the first trade\nwind and monsoon maps14 , over the seas4 . It may be pointed out that he did\n\n4 Halley\n\nis also known for the discovery of a comet bearing his name and for using Breslau mortality\n\ntables, - the basis of useful statistical work in actuary science.\n\n6\n\n\fnot know Coriolis forces yet.\nA second major step for meteorology seems to be due to Karl Theodor\nwho between 1781 and 1792 was responsible for the Palatinate Meteorological\nSociety. He invited (39) friends around the world14 , from Massachusetts to\nUral, to make three measurements per day, and report them to him, in order\nto later publish \"Ephemerides\", in Manheim.\nI am very pleased to point out that Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes(1777-1834),\nProfessor of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Breslau was the\nfirst14 who had the idea of displaying weather data (temperature, air pressure,\na.s.o.) on geographical maps5 .\nLater von Humboldt (1769-1859) had the idea to connect points in order\nto draw isotherms14 . No need to say that this was a bold step, - the first\ntruly predictive step implying quantitative thermodynamics data. Most likely\na quite incorrect result. It is well known nowadays that various algorithms\nwill give various isotherms, starting from the same temperature data and\ncoordinate table. In the same line of lack of precision, there is no proof at\nall that the highest temperature during the 2003 summer was 42.6\u25e6 C at the\npoint of measurement at Cordoba Airport on Aug. 12, 2003. There is no\nproof that the highest temperature was 24.9\u25e6 C in Poland, in Warsaw-Ok\u0229cie,\non that day in 2003. There is no proof that we will ever know the lowest\ntemperature in Poland in 2003 either. In fact the maximum or minimum\ntemperature as defined in meteorology15,16 are far from the ones acceptable\nin physics laboratories. Therefore what isotherms are drawn from such data?\nThey connect data points which values are obtained at different times! What\n\n5 It\n\nseems that H.W. Brandes left Breslau to get his Ph.D. thesis in Heidelberg in 1826. Alas it\n\nseems that the original drawings are not available at this time. Where are they?\n\n7\n\n\fis their physical meaning ? One might accept to consider that isotherms result\nfrom some truly averaged temperature during one day (!) at some location\n(?). What is an average temperature? In meteorology, it is NOT the ratio\nof the integral of the temperature distribution function over a time interval\nto that time interval15,16 . Nor is it a spatial mean. In fact, what is a \"mean\ntemperature\" ... for a city, a country, ... for the world? One might propose\nthat one has to measure the temperature everywhere and continuously in time,\nthen make an average. Questions are not only how many thermometers does\none need, but also what precision is needed. Does one need to distribute the\nthermometers homogeneously? What about local peculiarities? like nuclear\nplants ? Should we need a fractal distribution in space of thermometers?\nMight one use a Monte Carlo approach to locate them such that statistical\ntheories give some idea on error bars. What error bars ? There is no error\nbar ever given on weather maps, in newspapers or TV, on radio and rarely\nin scientific publications. Errors are bad ! and forgotten. There is rarely a\ncertitude (or risk) coefficient which is mentioned. It might not be necessary\nfor the public, but yet we know, and it will be recalled later, that for computer\nwork and predictions the initial values should be well defined. Therefore it\nseems essential to concentrate on predicting the uncertainty in forecast models\nof weather and climate as emphasized elsewhere17,18 .\n\nIII. CLIMATE AND WEATHER. THE ROLE OF CLOUDS\n\nUp to von Humboldt there was no correlation discussed, no model of\nweather, except for qualitative considerations, only through the influence of\nthe earth rotation, moon phases, Saturn, or Venus or Jupiter or constellation\nlocations, etc. However the variables of interest were becoming to be known,\nbut predictive meteorology and more generally climate (description and) fore-\n\n8\n\n\fcasting had still a need for better observational techniques, data collecting,\nsubsequent analysis19 , and model outputs.\nEarth's climate is clearly determined by complex interactions between\nsun, oceans, atmosphere, land and biosphere20,21 . The composition of the\natmosphere is particularly important because certain gases, including water\nvapor, carbon dioxide, etc., absorb heat radiated from Earth's surface. As\nthe atmosphere warms up, it in turn radiates heat back to the surface that\nincreases the earth's \"mean surface temperature\", by some 30 K above the\nvalue that would occur in the absence of a radiation-trapping atmosphere21 .\nNote that perturbations in the concentration of the radiation active gases do\nalter the intensity of this effect on the earth's climate.\nUnderstanding the processes and properties that effect atmospheric radiation and, in particular, the influence of clouds and the role of cloud radiative\nfeedback are issues of great scientific interest22,23 . This leads to efforts to\nimprove not only models of the earth's climate but also predictions of climate\nchange24 , as understood over long time intervals, in contrast to shorter time\nscales for weather forecast. In fact, with respect to climatology the situation\nis very complicated because one does not even know what the evolution equations are. Since controlled experiments cannot be performed on the climate\nsystem, one relies on using ad hoc models to identify cause-and-effect relationships. Nowadays there are several climate models belonging to many different\ncenters25 . Their web sites not only carry sometimes the model output used to\nmake images but also provide the source code. It seems relevant to point out\nhere that the stochastic resonance idea was proposed to describe climatology\nevolution26 .\nPhenomena of interest occurring on short (!) time and small (!) space\nscales, whence the weather, are represented through atmospheric models with\na set of nonlinear differential equations based on Navier-Stokes equations27\n\n9\n\n\ffor describing fluid motion, in terms of mass, pressure, temperature, humidity,\nvelocity, energy exchange, including solar radiation ... whence for predicting\nthe weather6 . It should be remembered that solutions of such equations forcefully depend on the initial conditions, and steps of integrations. Therefore a\ngreat precision on the temperature, wind velocity, etc. cannot be expected\nand the solution(s) are only looking like a mess after a few numerical steps29 .\nThe Monte Carlo technique suggests to introduce successively a set of initial\nconditions, perform the integration of the differential equations and make an\naverage thereafter29 . If some weather map is needed, a grid is used with constraints on the nodes, but obviously the precision (!) is not remarkable, - but\nwho needs it ?\nIt is hereby time to mention Lorenz's30 famous pioneering work who simplified Navier-Stokes equations 7 . However, predicting the result of a complex\nnonlinear interactions taking place in an open system is a difficult task32 .\nMuch attention has been paid recently33,34 to the importance of the main\ncomponents of the atmosphere, in particular clouds, (see Appendix A) in\nthe water three forms - vapor, liquid and solid, for buffering the global\ntemperature against reduced or increased solar heating35 . Owing to its special\nproperties, it is believed, that water establishes lower and upper boundaries\non how far the temperature can drift from today's. However, the role of clouds\nand water vapor in climate change is not well understood. In fact, there may\n\n6 It\n\nis fair to mention Sorel work28 about general motion of the atmosphere in order to explain\n\nstrong winds on the Mediterranean sea. The quoted reference has some interesting introduction\nabout previous work\n7 Beautiful\n\nand thought provoking illustrations can be found on various websites31 , demonstrating\n\nPoincar\u00e9 cross sections, strange attractors, cycles, bifurcations, and the like.\n\n10\n\n\fbe positive feedback between water vapor and other greenhouse gases. Studies\nsuggest that the heliosphere influences the Earth climate via mechanisms that\naffecting the cloud cover36,37 . Surprisingly the influence of solar variability is\nfound to be strong on low clouds (3 km), whence pointing to a microphysical\nmechanism involving aerosol formation enhanced by ionization due to cosmic\nrays.\nAt time scales of less than one day, significant fluxes of heat, water vapor\nand momentum are exchanged due to entrainment, radiative transfer, and/or\nturbulence21,38\u201342 . The turbulent character of the motion in the atmospheric\nboundary layer (ABL) is one of its most important features. Turbulence can\nbe caused by a variety of processes, like thermal convection, or mechanically\ngenerated by wind shear, or following interactions influenced by the rotation of\nthe Earth39,41 . This complexity of physical processes and interactions between\nthem create a variety of atmospheric formations. In particular, in a cloudy\nABL the radiative fluxes produce local sources of heating or cooling within\nthe mixed-layer and therefore can greatly influence its turbulent structure and\ndynamics, especially in the cloud base.\nThe atmospheric boundary layer is defined by its inner (surface)\nlayer20,21,38,39 . In an unstably stratified ABL the dominating convective motions are generated by strong surface heating from the Sun or by cloud-topped\nradiative cooling processes21 . In contrast, a stably stratified ABL occurs\nmostly at night in response to the surface cooling due to long-wave length\nradiation emitted into the space.\nIn presence of clouds (shallow cumulus, stratocumulus or stratus) the\nstructure of the ABL is modified because of the radiative fluxes. Thermodynamical phase changes become important. During cloudy conditions one\ncan distinguish mainly : (i) the case in which the cloud and the sub-cloud\nlayers are fully coupled; (ii) two or more cloud layers beneath the inversion,\n\n11\n\n\fwith the lower layer well-mixed with an upper elevated layer, decoupled from\nthe surface mixed layer or (iii) a radiation driven elevated mixed cloud layer,\ndecoupled from the surface.\nTwo practical cases can be considered : the marine ABL and the continental ABL. The former is characterized by a high concentration of moisture.\nIt is wet, mobile and has a well expressed lower boundary. The competition\nbetween the processes of radiative cooling, entrainment of warm and dry air\nfrom above the cloud and turbulent buoyancy fluxes determine the state of\nequilibrium of the cloud-topped marine boundary layer21 . The continental\nABL is usually dryer, less mobile, better defined lower and upper boundaries.\nBoth cases have been investigated for their scaling properties43\u201345\n\nIV. MODERN STATISTICAL PHYSICS APPROACHES\n\nThe modern paradigm in statistical physics is that systems obey \"universal\" laws due to the underlying nonlinear dynamics independently of microscopic details. Therefore it can be searched in meteorology whether one can\nobtain characteristic quantities using the modern statistical physics methods\nas done in other laboratory or computer investigations. To distinguish cases\nand patterns due to \"external field\" influences or mere self-organized situations in geophysics phenomena46 is not obvious indeed. What sort of feedback\ncan be found? or neglected ? Is the equivalent of chicken-egg priority problem in geophysics easily solved? The coupling between human activities and\ndeterministic physics is hard to model on simple terms47 , or can even be\nrejected48 .\nDue to the nonlinear physics laws governing the phenomena in the atmosphere, the time series of the atmospheric quantities are usually nonstationary48,49 as revealed by Fourier spectral analysis, - whih is usually the\n\n12\n\n\ffirst technique to use. Recently, new techniques have been developed that\ncan systematically eliminate trends and cycles in the data and thus reveal\nintrinsic dynamical properties such as correlations that are very often masked\nby nonstationarities,50,51 . Whence many studies reveal long-range power-law\ncorrelations in geophysics time series46,49,52 in particular in meteorology53\u2013 60 .\nMulti-affine properties45,61\u201369 can also be identified, using singular spectrum\nor/and wavelets.\nThere are different levels of essential interest for sorting out correlations\nfrom data, in order to increase the confidence in predictability70 . There are\ninvestigations based on long-, medium-, and short-range horizons. The idiagram variability (iV D) method allows to sort out some short range correlations. The technique has been used on a liquid water cloud content data set\ntaken from the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) 92\nfield program71 . It has also been shown that the random matrix approach can\nbe applied to the empirical correlation matrices obtained from the analysis of\nthe basic atmospheric parameters that characterize the state of atmosphere72 .\nThe principal component analysis technique is a standard technique73 in meteorology and climate studies. The Fokker-Planck equation for describing the\nliquid water path74 is also of interest. See also some tentative search for power\nlaw correlations in the Southern Oscillation Index fluctuations characterizing\nEl Ni\u00f1o75 . But there are many other works of interest76 .\n\nA. Ice in cirrus clouds\n\nIn clouds, ice appears in a variety of forms, shapes, depending on the\nformation mechanism and the atmospheric conditions3,4,41,61,77,78 The cloud\ninner structure, content, temperature, life time, .. can be studied. In cirrus\nclouds, at temperatures colder than about \u221240\u25e6 C ice crystals form. Because\n\n13\n\n\fof the vertical extent, ca. from about 4 to 14 km and higher, and the layered\nstructure of such clouds one way of obtaining some information about their\nproperties is mainly by using ground-based remote sensing instruments (see\nAppendix B), and searching for the statistical properties (and correlations) of\nthe radio wave signal backscattered from the ice crystals. This backscattered\nsignal received at the radar receiver antenna is known to depend on the ice\nmass content and the particle size distribution. Because of the vertical structure of the cirrus cloud it is of interest to examine the time correlations in the\nscattered signal on the horizontal boundaries, i.e., the top and bottom, and\nat several levels within the cloud.\nWe have reported60 along the DFA correlations in the fluctuations of radar\nsignals obtained at isodepths of winter and f all cirrus clouds. In particular\nwe have focussed attention on three quantities: (i) the backscattering crosssection, (ii) the Doppler velocity and (iii) the Doppler spectral width. They\ncorrespond to the physical coefficients used in Navier Stokes equations to\ndescribe flows, i.e. bulk modulus, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. It was\nfound that power-law time correlations exist with a crossover between regimes\nat about 3 to 5 min, but also 1/f behavior, characterizing the top and the\nbottom layers and the bulk of the clouds. The underlying mechanisms for such\ncorrelations likely originate in ice nucleation and crystal growth processes.\n\nB. Stratus clouds\n\nIn another case, i.e.\n\nfor stratus clouds, long-range power-law\n\ncorrelations55,59 and multi-affine properties44,45,67 have reported for the liquid water fluctuations, beside the spectral density79 . Interestingly, stratus\n\n14\n\n\fcloud data retrieved from the radiance, recorded as brightness temperature,8\nat the Southern Great Plains central facility and operated in the vertically\npointing mode80 (see Appendix B for a brief technical note on instrumentation) indicated for the Fourier spectrum S(f ) \u223c f \u2212\u03b2 , a \u03b2 exponent equal\nto 1.56 \u00b1 0.03 pointing to a nonstationary time series. The DFA statistical\nmethod applied on the stratus cloud brightness microwave recording55,81 indicates the existence of long-range power-law correlations over a two hour\ntime.\nContrasts in behaviors, depending on seasons can be pointed out. The\nDFA analysis of liquid water path data measured in April 1998 gives a scaling\nexponent \u03b1 = 0.34 \u00b1 0.01 holding from 3 to 60 minutes. This scaling range is\nshorter than the 150 min scaling range55 for a stratus cloud in January 1998\nat the same site. For longer correlation times a crossover to \u03b1 = 0.50 \u00b1 0.01\nis seen up to about 2 h, after which the statistics of the DFA function is not\nreliable.\nHowever a change in regime from Gaussian to non-Gaussian fluctuation\nregimes has been clearly defined for the cloud structure changes using a finite\nsize (time) interval window. It has been shown that the DFA exponent turns\nfrom a low value (about 0.3) to 0.5 before the cloud breaks. This indicates\nthat the stability of the cloud, represented by antipersistent fluctuations is\n(for some unknown reason at this level) turning into a system for which the\nfluctuations are similar to a pure random walk. The same type of finding was\nobserved for the so called Liquid Water Path9 of the cloud.\n\n8 http://www.phys.unm.edu/\n9 The\n\nduric/phy423/l1/node3.html\n\nliquid water path (LWP) is the amount of liquid water in a vertical column of the atmosphere;\n\nit is measured in cm\u22123 ; sometimes in cm !!!\n\n15\n\n\fThe value of \u03b1 \u2248 0.3 can be interpreted as the H1 parameter of the multifractal analysis of liquid water content44,45,62 and of liquid water path67 .\nWhence, the appearance of broken clouds and clear sky following a period of\nthick stratus can be interpreted as a non equilibrium transition or a sort of\nfracture process in more conventional physics. The existence of a crossover\nsuggests two types of correlated events as in classical fracture processes: nucleation and growth of diluted droplets. Such a marked change in persistence\nimplies that specific fluctuation correlation dynamics should be usefully inserted as ingredients in ad hoc models.\nThe non equilibrium nature of the cloud structure and content82 should\nreceive some further thought henceforth. It would have been interesting to\nhave other data on the cloud in order to understand the cause of the change\nin behavior.\n\nC. Cloud base height\n\nThe variations in the local \u03b1-exponent (\"multi-affinity\") suggest that the\nnature of the correlations change with time, so called intermittency phenomena. The evolution of the time series can be decomposed into successive persistent and anti-persistent sequences. It should be noted that the intermittency\nof a signal is related to existence of extreme events, thus a distribution of\nevents away from a Gaussian distribution, in the evolution of the process that\nhas generated the data. If the tails of the distribution function follow a power\nlaw, then the scaling exponent defines the critical order value after which the\nstatistical moments of the signal diverge. Therefore it is of interest to probe\nthe distribution of the fluctuations of a time dependent signal y(t) prior investigating its intermittency. Much work has been devoted to the cloud base\nheight64\u201366 , under various ABL conditions, and the LWP67,74 . Neither the\n\n16\n\n\fdistribution of the fluctuations of liquid water path signals nor those of the\ncloud base height appear to be Gaussian. The tails of the distribution follow\na power law pointing to \"large events\" also occurring in the meteorological\n(space and time) framework. This may suggest routes for other models.\n\nD. Sea Surface Temperature\n\nTime series analysis methods searching for power law exponents allow to\nlook from specific view points, like atmospheric83 or sea surface temperature\nfluctuations84 . These are of importance for weighing their impacts on regional\nclimate, whence finally to greatly increase predictability of precipitation during all seasons.\nCurrently, scientists rely on climate patterns derived from global sea surface temperatures (SST) to forecast precipitation e.g. the U.S. winter. For\nexample, rising warm moist air creates tropical storms during El Ni\u00f1o years,\na period of above average temperatures in the waters in the central and eastern tropical Pacific. While the tropical Pacific largely dictates fall and winter\nprecipitation levels, the strength of the SST signal falls off by spring through\nthe summer. For that reason, summer climate predictions are very difficult\nto make.\nRecently we have attempted to observe whether the fluctuations in the\nSouthern Oscillation index (SOI) characterizing El Ni\u00f1o were also prone to a\npower law analysis. For the SOI monthly averaged data time interval 18662000, the tails of the cumulative distribution of the fluctuations of SOI signal\nit is found that large fluctuations are more likely to occur than the Gaussian\ndistribution would predict. An antipersistent type of correlations exist for a\ntime interval ranging from about 4 months to about 6 years. This leads to\nfavor specific physical models for El Ni\u00f1o description75 .\n\n17\n\n\fV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nModern statistical physics techniques for analyzing atmospheric time series signals indicate scaling laws (exponents and ranges) for correlations. A\nfew examples have been given briefly here above, mainly from contributed\npapers in which the author has been involved. Work by many other authors have not been included for lack of space. This brief set of comments\nis only intended for indicating how meteorology and climate problems can be\ntied to scaling laws and inherent time series data analysis techniques. Those\nideas/theories have allowed me to reduce the list of quoted references, though\neven like this I might have been unfair. One example can be recalled in this\nconclusion to make the point: the stratus clouds break when the molecule\ndensity fluctuations become Gaussian, i.e. when the molecular motion becomes Brownian-like. This should lead to better predictability on the cloud\nevolution. Many other examples can be imagined. In fact, it would be of interest for predictability models to examine whether the long range fluctuations\nbelong to a Levy-like or Tsallis or ... rather than to a Gaussian distribution\nas in many self organized criticality models. This answer, if positive, would\nenormously extend the predictability range in weather forecast.\nAcknowledgments\n\nPart of this studies have been supported through an Action Concert\u00e9e\nProgram of the University of Li\u00e8ge (Convention 02/07-293).

CLOUDS\nIt may be of interest for such a type of proceedings to define clouds, or at\nleast to review briefly cloud classifications. Clouds can be classified by their\n\n18\n\n\faltitude\n1. High clouds: High clouds are those having a cloud base above 6000 m, where there is little\nmoisture in the air. Typically they contain ice crystals, often appear thin and wispy, and\nsometimes appear to create a halo around the sun or the moon. High clouds are Cirrus (Ci),\nCirrostratus (Cs), Cirrocumulus (Cc) and Cumulonimbus (Cb)\n2. Middle clouds: Middle clouds have a cloud base between 2000 m and 6000 m. These clouds\nare usually composed of water droplets, but sometimes contain ice crystals, if the air is cold\nenough. Middle clouds are Altostratus (As) and Altocumulus (Ac).\n3. Low clouds: Low clouds have a cloud base at less than 2000 m and appear mostly above\nthe sea surface. Usually composed of water droplets except in winter at high latitudes when\nsurface air temperature is below freezing. Low clouds are Stratus (St), Stratocumulus (Sc)\nand Cumulus (Cu).\nor by their shape:\n1. Cirrus: The cirrus are thin, hair-like clouds found at high altitudes.\n2. Stratus: The stratus clouds are layered clouds with distinguished top and bottom. Found\nat all altitudes, they generally thinner when high: (i) High: The high stratus are called\nCirrostratus; (ii) Middle: The middle stratus are called Altostratus; (iii) Low: The low ones\nare stratus and nimbostratus\n3. Cumulus: The cumulus clouds are fluffy heaps or puffs. They are found at all altitudes;\ngenerally they are lighter and smaller when become high: (i) High: The high cumulus are\ncalled Cirrocumulus; (ii) Middle: The middle cumulus are called Altocumulus; (iii) Low:\nThe low ones are Stratocumulus and Cumulus.\n4. Cumulonimbus: The cumulonimbus clouds are thunder clouds. Some large cumulus clouds\nare height enough to reach across low, middle and even high altitude.\n\n19\n\n\fNote that due to their relatively small sizes and life time cumulus clouds produce short time\nseries for remote sensing measurements (see App. B). Therefore such clouds and data series\nare not often suitable for many techniques mentioned in this report. It is fair to point out\non such clouds the study pertaining to a phenomenon of Abelian nature, rain fall85,86 . Much\nwork has been devoted to rain of course, see e.g. Andrade et al.86\u201388 or Lovejoy et al.89\u201392\n\nAPPENDIX B. Experimental techniques and data acquisition\nQuantitative observations of the atmosphere are made in many different\nways. Experimental/observational techniques to study the atmosphere rely\non physical principles. One important type of observational techniques is that\nof remote sounding, which depends on the detection of electromagnetic radiation emitted, scattered or transmitted by the atmosphere. The instruments\ncan be placed at aircrafts, on balloons or on the ground. Remote-sounding\ntechniques can be divided into passive and active types. In passive remote\nsounding, the radiation measured is of natural origin, for example the thermal radiation emitted by the atmosphere, or solar radiation transmitted or\nscattered by the atmosphere. Most space-born remote sounding methods are\npassive. In active remote sounding, a transmitter, e.g. a radar, is used to\ndirect pulses of radiation into the atmosphere, where they are scattered by\natmospheric molecules, aerosols or inhomogeneities in the atmospheric structure. Some of the scattered radiation is then detected by some receiver. Each\nof these techniques has its advantages and disadvantages. Remote sounding\nfrom satellites can give near-global coverage, but can provide only averaged\nvalues of the measured quantity over large regions, of order of hundreds of\nkilometers in horizontal extent and several kilometers in the vertical direction.\nGround-based radars can provide data with very high vertical resolution (by\nmeasuring small differences in the time delays of the return pulses), but only\n\n20\n\n\fabove the radar site.\nFor a presentation of remote sensing techniques the reader can consult\nmany authors21,80,92\u201395 , or the ARM site96\u201398 . For example, microwave radiometers work at frequencies of 23.8 and 31.4 GHz. At the DOE ARM\nprogram SGP central facility, in the vertically pointing mode, the radiometer makes sequential 1 s radiance measurements in each of the two channels\nwhile pointing vertically upward into the atmosphere. After collecting these\nradiances the radiometer mirror is rotated to view a blackbody reference target. For each of the two channels the radiometer records the radiance from\nthe reference immediately followed by a measurement of a combined radiance\nfrom the reference and a calibrated noise diode. This measurement cycle is\nrepeated once every 20 s. Note that clouds at 2 km of altitude moving at 10\nm s\u22121 take 15 s to advect through a radiometer field-of-view of approximately\n5\u25e6 . The 1 s sky radiance integration time ensures that the retrieved quantities\ncorrespond to a specific column of cloud above the instrument.\nThe Belfort Laser Ceilometer (BLC)92,98 detects clouds by transmitting\npulses of infrared light (l=910 nm) vertically into the atmosphere (with a pulse\nrepetition frequency fr=976.6 Hz) and analyzing the backscattered signals\nfrom the atmosphere. The ceilometer actively collects backscattered photons\nfor about 5 seconds within every 30-second measurement period. The BLC\nis able to measure the base height of the lowest cloud from 15 up to 7350 m\ndirectly above mean ground level. The ceilometer works with a 15 m spatial\nresolution and reaches the maximum measurable height of 4 km. The time\nresolution of CBH records is 30 seconds.\n\n21\n\n\fREFERENCES\n1\n\nhttp://deutsche-boerse.com/app/open/xelsius\n\n2\n\nS. Lovejoy, Science 216 (1982) 185\n\n3\n\nF. S. Rys and A.
