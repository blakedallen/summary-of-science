Introduction\nWe devote our attention to the ideal and resistive MHD models, which despite their\ndramatic simplification of plasma behaviour, are crucial to the design and operation of\ncontrolled fusion devices and are at the core of many astrophysical plasma models.\nSimplified models such as these have utility if they can be used to make testable\npredictions or if they yield insight into the internal processes of a system. We test\ntwo variants of incompressible resistive MHD with these criteria in mind. The starting\npoint for the analysis of most plasma models is an understanding of the wavemodes that\narise: this provides information about the linear response and stability of the system\nand provides a basis for much nonlinear analysis. We focus on the linear behaviour\nof the plasma in this paper. For the resistive MHD model, which includes dissipation,\nthe wavemodes are non-normal: a full picture of linear plasma behaviour requires an\nanalysis of the transient behaviour of the system, as well as the eigenvalue analysis\nwhich predicts asymptotic behaviours over long time scales. These are closely related\nvia pseudospectral methods [1]. In this paper we restrict attention to eigenvalue analysis.\nFor many plasmas of physical interest it is true that the resistive term is small: typically\nthis is quantified by a large magnetic Reynolds number. It might have been expected\nthat for small enough resistivity, the resistive MHD model could simply be treated\nas a perturbation of the ideal MHD model. However, the change induced is actually a\nsingular perturbation, which introduces higher spatial derivatives. One of the interesting\neffects of this property is that eigenfrequencies in the ideal model are not necessarily\napproached by the eigenfrequencies of any resistive modes, even for vanishingly small\nresistivity.\nMany papers have been published on the stable resistive MHD spectrum and several of\nthe early papers ([2]- [6]) focused on cylindrical models. These papers have established\ncertain generic features of the resistive spectrum. The resistive spectrum is discrete,\nunlike the ideal MHD spectrum which has continua: on some intervals, every frequency\ncorresponds to a generalised wavemode. In the resistive spectrum, a large number of\nfully complex eigenfrequencies can be found, and in general these lie along loci, or lines,\non the complex plane. Generally as the resistivity is decreased to zero these lines become\ndensely populated with eigenvalues.\nResistive MHD is a simple closure of the full kinetic equations, and as a result the plasma\ndynamics parallel to the magnetic field lines are often quite poorly represented [7]. For\nAlv\u00e9nic modes, which do not strongly compress the plasma, these parallel dynamics\nare generally unimportant. However, for the slow and fast magnetoacoustic waves, the\nparallel dynamics and the effects of compressibility are important; these waves are not\nnecessarily well modelled by resistive MHD.\nIt is possible to find the compressible resistive MHD spectrum numerically (as in [5]) and\nignore the slow and fast magnetoacoustic waves that are present. On the other hand,\nthere are approaches which promise to isolate the Alfv\u00e9nic portion of the spectrum and\nsimplify the analysis. We present two of these incompressible approximations, in which\n\n\fINCOMPRESSIBLE LIMIT FOR RESISTIVE PLASMAS\n\n3\n\nthe predicted motions of the plasma satisfy \u2207*v = 0 (at least approximately). One\napproach is to artificially set the ratio of specific heats \u03b3 to infinity (as in [4] and [6]).\nIn the other, an anisotropic mass tensor \u03c1 is used, with the component parallel to the\nmagnetic field taken to vanish, \u03c1k /\u03c1\u22a5 \u2192 0. With this density tensor, ideal eigenmodes\nare incompressible, but to ensure exact incompressibility for resistive eigenmodes \u03b3\nmust again be set to \u221e. We can view these models as the extreme cases of a generalised\nresistive MHD model with two parameters, \u03b3 and \u03c1k /\u03c1\u22a5 . The two extreme cases are\nnot equivalent, and the resulting spectra are qualitatively different. We investigate\nthese two methods, and compare them with the compressible resistive MHD model. We\nspecialise to equilibria with zero background flow. Note that \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e may be physically\nappropriate for particular conductive fluids and plasmas with \u03b2 >> 1.\nFirst, we examine the plane waves of the homogeneous incompressible MHD model.\nThen we evaluate spectra in a simple cylindrical equilibrium for varying values of \u03b3,\nand with and without an artificial anisotropic density. This illustrates the transition\nbetween the compressible and incompressible cases. We then discuss the spectra of more\ngeneral plasma configurations. A WKB analysis of a generic incompressible model is\nthen undertaken in order to understand the features of these spectra and to verify the\nnumerics. We begin by solving the dispersion relation. Then the singular features of this\nfunction are explored by reducing it to a simpler form. To complete the groundwork for\nsemi-analytic calculations, the behaviour of the wave equation near these singular points\nis examined. Finally, we use our WKB analysis to find the spectrum of an example case.\n2. Wavemodes in incompressible MHD limits\nThe first step in the analysis of these incompressible limits is a determination of the\nwavemodes in a simple homogeneous plasma. To this end we follow [7] and derive wave\nfrequencies. We begin by considering a wave with wavevector at some angle to the\nmagnetic field B = B0 \u1e91, so k = kk \u1e91 + k\u22a5 x\u0302, travelling in a plasma with sound speed\nVs = (\u03b3p0 /\u03c10 )1/2 and Alfv\u00e9n speed Va = (B02 /\u03bc0 \u03c10 )1/2 . We recover the Alfv\u00e9n spectrum:\n\u03c9A2 = kk2 Va 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nand also two other solutions to the plasma equations:\n\u0011\n\u03c1k \u2212 \u03c1\u22a5 2 2 \u0010\n1 2 2\n2\n2 12\n2\nk V ) 1 \u00b1 (1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) ,\n\u03c9\u00b1 = k (Va + Vs +\n2\n\u03c1k k 2 k s\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b12 =\n\n4\u03c1\u22a5 kk2 Va 2 Vs 2\nk 2 \u03c1k (Va 2 + Vs 2 +\n\n\u03c1k \u2212\u03c1\u22a5 2 2 2 .\nk V )\n\u03c1k k 2 k s\n\n(3)\n\nIn low-\u03b2 compressible plasmas, \u03c9+ corresponds to the fast magnetoacoustic wave, and\n\u03c9\u2212 to the slow magnetoacoustic wave.\n2\n2\nIn the limit \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e (with \u03c1k /\u03c1\u22a5 = 1) we find \u03c9+\n\u2192 \u221e and \u03c9\u2212\n\u2192 kk2 Va 2 , so that the slowmode is now degenerate with the Alfv\u00e9n mode. In more general plasma configurations,\n\n\fINCOMPRESSIBLE LIMIT FOR RESISTIVE PLASMAS\n\n4\n\nthe slow and the Alfv\u00e9n wavemodes still occur at very similar frequencies, and therefore\ncan be strongly mixed. We show this does occur, so that generic spectra determined\nare composed of an unphysical combination of these types of wavemodes. In the limit\n2\n2 2\n\u03c1k /\u03c1\u22a5 \u2192 0 we again have \u03c9+ \u2192 \u221e, but \u03c9\u2212\n\u2192 k 2 Va2 + k\u22a5\nVs , which is slightly larger\nthan the fast magnetoacoustic frequency. In this case we have suppressed the slow\nmagnetoacoustic waves.\nIf we set \u03c1k /\u03c1\u22a5 \u2192 0, we can show from the linearised equations that for general resistive\nMHD wavemodes \u03c1k \u2192 0 implies:\nB0 *\u2207(\u2207*v) = \u2212\n\n\u2207P0 *\u2207\u00d7(\u03b7j)\n,\n(\u03b3P0 )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere B0 and P0 are the equilibrium field and pressure, \u03b7 is the resistivity and j and\nv are the perturbed current and velocity. So for the ideal case (\u03b7 = 0) we have that\n\u2207*v is a constant on all irrational surfaces, and, by continuity, for finite toroidal or\npoloidal mode number, we must have \u2207*v = 0. In the resistive case, we have small \u03b7,\nbut possibly large d/dr so that resistive modes are not strictly incompressible. However,\nif we also require \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e then the resistive modes are strictly incompressible.\n3. Numerical results of varying incompressibility\nIn order to show the effect of incompressibility on the resistive MHD spectrum, we\nsolved the compressible, resistive MHD equations numerically. We use a code based on\nthe description in [8].\nWe examine a cylindrical, zero-shear model case, as described in [6] , with\n\u03b2 \u2248 4%. The incompressibility is explored by varying \u03b3 in the range 1 \u2013 1000. The\nincompressible limits correspond to \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e, but in this case \u03b3 \u2243 1000 is high enough\nto demonstrate the limit. We define the magnetic Reynolds number S = \u03c4R /\u03c4A where\n\u03c4A and \u03c4R are the Alfv\u00e9n and resistive timescales. For a cylinder of radius rp we have\n\u03c4A = rp (\u03bc0 \u03c1)1/2 /Bz , and \u03c4R = rp2 \u03bc0 /\u03b70 . The magnetic field perturbations are of the form\nb = exp (im\u03b8 \u2212 i\u03baz/rp \u2212 i\u03c9t) b (r), with \u03ba = nrp /R, by analogy with the toroidal case\nR can be interpreted in the sense that 2\u03c0R is the length of the plasma column and n\nis the 'toroidal' mode number. We have \u03b2 \u2248 4%, which allows the slow-mode spectrum\nto be shown on the same scale as the Alfv\u00e9n spectrum in the compressible case. The\nresulting spectra are shown in figure 1. For this case m = 1, \u03ba = 0.35, nq = 1.2 and\nS = 1 \u00d7 104 . Note that figure 1(e) corresponds to the limit \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e and figure 1(f)\ncorresponds to the limit \u03c1k /\u03c1\u22a5 \u2192 0.\nIn these cases the ideal Alfv\u00e9n continuum degenerates to a point, at \u03c9A = 0.057, but the\nideal slow continuum is finite in extent because of pressure and field strength variation\nacross the plasma. The slow continuum extends to the origin because the pressure is\ntaken to be zero at the plasma boundary. Note the fork structure seen for the slow modes\nnear the origin of figure 1(a).

It\nhas been shown in [6] that for this incompressible case wavemodes are eigenfunctions of\nhelicity and none of the modes correspond directly to physical compressible wavemodes.\nIn figure 1(e), the two loci of eigenvalues correspond to wavemodes of opposite helicity.\nFor the \u03c1k /\u03c1\u22a5 \u2192 0 model, we find a spectrum [figure 1(f)] very similar to the\ncompressible spectrum in figure 1(a), but with the notable absence of the slow-mode fork.\nThe position of individual Alfv\u00e9nic eigenvalues is in fact well preserved in this model.\nThe only noticable deviation is the eigenmode near the real axis, at Re(\u03c9) \u2243 0.035,\nwhich has a frequency shift of magnitude \u2243 0.004 as a result of setting \u03c1k /\u03c1\u22a5 \u2192 0. Since\nthis Alfv\u00e9n eigenmode is fairly close in frequency to the slow modes, it is not surprising\nthat it is the one most strongly modified by an assumption of incompressibility.\n4. Generic spectra in resistive MHD\nFor general plasma configurations with shear, the resistive Alfv\u00e9n spectrum is usually\nfound to form a fork (e.g. figure 2 or those in [2] - [5]) The rather different shape of the\nspectral loci in [figures 1(a)-(f)] is a consequence of the equilibrium having an Alfv\u00e9n\nspectrum which degenerates to a point.\nThe fork structure in the resistive MHD spectrum has been qualitatively explained in\nterms of WKB analysis by examining turning points within the plasma, see [3] and\n\n\f6\n\nINCOMPRESSIBLE LIMIT FOR RESISTIVE PLASMAS\n0.03\n0.02\n\nIm(frequency)\n\n0.01\n0\n-0.01\n-0.02\n-0.03\n-0.04\n-0.05\n-0.06\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\nRe(frequency)\n\nFigure 2. A typical eigenvalue spectrum for a compressible (\u03b3 = 53 ) resistive MHD\ncase showing the complex frequencies of damped and growing normal modes. In this\nlow-pressure case, slow magnetosonic modes have eigenfrequencies very close to the\norigin and are not shown. The plasma model parameters are similar to the constant\ncurrent case, but with a small shear: m = 1, \u03ba = 0.35, nq(r) = 1.2 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 0.1r) and\nS = 3 \u00d7 103. The ideal Alfv\u00e9n continuum is represented by a grey line on the real axis.\n\n[5]. The fork has three lines joining at a point below the ideal MHD continuum. Two\nlines run between the intersection point and either end of the Alfv\u00e9n continuum. The\nthird line runs around approximately in a quarter circle to touch the imaginary axis.\nIn a simple model with toroidal current density constant across the plasma, there is\nan analytical solution for the \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e resistive MHD spectrum [6]. We show that a\nperturbed variant of this constant current model, in which a slight shear is given to the\nmagnetic field, is still amenable to the manipulations performed in [6]. By introducing\nshear we produce a model which has a finite width Alfv\u00e9n continuum, in which we might\nhope to recover the generic fork structure found in compressible results. We therefore\nsolved this model using WKB analysis to explain the qualitatively different spectrum.\nIn the remainder of this paper we set \u03c1\u22a5 = \u03c1k = \u03c1.\n5. WKB analysis of a small shear equilibrium in the limit \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e\nThe model case is derived from [6], which considers a cylindrical plasma with a constant\naxial field and no shear. This model has been studied earlier in [9],[10]. The equations\nused for this analysis are those of linearised, resistive, incompressible MHD, with \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e:\n\u03c1\u03bc0\n\n\u2202\n(\u2207\u00d7v) = \u2207\u00d7(B*\u2207b + b*\u2207B),\n\u2202t\n\n(5)\n\nand magnetic field given by Amp\u00e9re's law\n\u03b7\n\u2202b\n= \u2207\u00d7(v\u00d7B) \u2212 \u2207\u00d7( \u2207\u00d7b).\n\u2202t\n\u03bc0\n\n(6)\n\nThe curl of the equation of motion is taken in order to suppress the perturbed pressure.\nAlso, we specialise to an equilibrium state with no plasma velocity.\n\n\f7\n\nINCOMPRESSIBLE LIMIT FOR RESISTIVE PLASMAS\n\nBz\n\nBp\n\nrp\n2\u03c0 R\nFigure 3. One period of the cylindrical model.\n\nThe idea is to introduce the shear as a small quantity, of the same order as the inverse\nwave number. The analysis is then the same as the shear-free case, up to two orders in\nthe inverse wavenumber. The radial dependence is included in the dispersion relation\nin the radially varying quantities: Bz (r), Bp (r) and q(r). We first take the large\nwavenumber limit by ordering \u2207 \u2243 O(1/\u01eb). For significantly dissipative modes, maximal\nbalance of Amp\u00e9re's law (6) occurs for \u01eb \u2243 O(S \u22121/2 ). In a typical physical situation we\nmight have S > 1000 and thus \u01eb < 0.03 is a good expansion parameter.\nThe magnetic field is expressed as B = \u1e91Bz (r) + r \u03b8\u0302Bp (r) with d(log[Bp (r)])/dr and\nd(log[Bz (r)])/dr both of O(\u01eb), in order to satisfy the requirement of small shear. We\nagain look at perturbations of the form b = exp (im\u03b8 \u2212 i\u03baz/rp \u2212 i\u03c9t) b (r) . For\nconvenience we set b as O(1) and this then implies v to be of O(1) to complete the\nordering. By using the relations \u2207 * b = \u2207 * v = 0, equations (5) and (6) can be reduced\nto:\nBp (r)\n2Bp (r)\n\u03c9\n\u03bab + O(\u01eb)\n(\u2207 \u00d7 v) =\n[m \u2212 nq(r)]\u2207 \u00d7 b +\n\u03c4A\nrp\nrp2\n\n(7)\n\ni\u03c9\niBp (r)\n\u03b7\nb=\n[m \u2212 nq(r)]v \u2212 (\u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 b) + O(\u01eb).\n\u03c4A\nrp\n\u03bc0\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c1\u03bc0\nand\n\u2212\n\nThe safety factor q(r) is given by rp Bz (r)/RBp (r) and the non-dimensional resistivity\n\u03b7 = S \u22121 .\nIn this form, the only differential operator is the curl operator.

Characterising the Stokes points\nTo find the WKB solutions, it is first necessary to examine the structure of the\ndispersion relation in the plasma region. In particular, singularities and zeros and\nthe associated branch structure of the dispersion relation must be examined. Branch\npoints of the dispersion relation are known as Stokes points. The dispersion relation\n(10) can be written as a cubic equation in \u03b1, with the coefficients as functions of\nq(r) = rp Bz (r)/RBp (r), i.e.\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012 \u00132 !\nq(r)R\nqR\n1\n+ \u03b1 [m \u2212 nq(r)]2 \u2212\n\u03c9 2 = 2[m \u2212 nq(r)]\u03ba.

Solving\nequation (16) for \u03b1 leads to very ungainly equations and proves not to be enlightening,\nso we look for a simpler relation which will be topologically equivalent. Let us consider\nthe case where there is no magnetic surface resonant with the perturbation. In this case\nwe have [nq(r) \u2212 m] 6= 0 within the plasma, and assuming also q(r) 6= 0 then we can\ndivide through the equation by 2[m \u2212 nq(r)]\u03ba and introduce a new variable \u1fb1 so that\n\u1fb13 + x(r)\u1fb1 = 1,\n\n(17)\n\n\f9\n\nINCOMPRESSIBLE LIMIT FOR RESISTIVE PLASMAS\nwith\n1\n\n\u1fb1 \u2261 \u03b1\n\n{2[nq(r) \u2212 m]\u03baS} 3\n\n(18)\n\n2\n\n(q(r)R/rp ) 3\n\nand\nx(r) \u2261\n\n\b\n[nq(r) \u2212 m]2 \u2212 [qR/rp ]2 \u03c9 2\n\n2\n\n{2[nq(r) \u2212 m]\u03baS(qR/rp )} 3\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nThe solution of equation (17) for \u1fb1 is\n1\n\n\u1fb1 = \u2212\u03be\n\n27 +\n\n\u221a\n\n23 x\n729 +\n\n108 x3\n\nwhere \u03be is one of the cube roots of \u22121:\n\n\u2217\n\u0001 31 + \u03be\n\n27 +\n\n\u221a\n\n729 + 108 x3\n1\n\n3 23\n\n\u0001 13\n\n,\n\n(20)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1+i 3 1\u2212i 3\n\u03be = \u22121,\n,\n.\n(21)\n2\n2\nWe consider x as a new radial variable.

However, not all of these candidate branch points are true\nbranch points, as suggested by figure 4. This can be seen in the \u03be = \u22121 case, where we\nhave, from equation (17)\nx(\u1fb1) =\n\n1 \u2212 \u1fb13\n,\n\u1fb1\n\n(22)\n\n\fINCOMPRESSIBLE LIMIT FOR RESISTIVE PLASMAS\n\n10\n\nwhich can be considered as a local inverse of p\nequation (20).\nLet us consider the neighbourhood of x = \u2212 3 27/4 (using the principal value, so x is\na negative real).pWe might expect a branch point here from the structure of equation\n(20). At x = \u2212 3 27/4 we have \u1fb1 = 22/3 . However, there is a neighbourhood around\n\u1fb1 = 22/3 where equation (22) is analytic and has apnon-zero derivative, and therefore\nthe function has an analytic inverse around x = \u2212 3 27/4. There obviously cannot be\na branch point in an analytic region. The other two candidate points are true branch\npoints. It similarly follows that each of the other cases of equation (20) have only\ntwo branch points each. Note that around a Stokes point at some position x0 , we do\n\u221a\nnot have \u03b1 \u221d x \u2212 x0 , as is typical for many WKB analyses [11]. Instead, we have\n\u221a\n\u03b1 \u2243 C + D x \u2212 x0 .\n7. Phase matching: a solution near the singularities\nIn order in proceed with WKB analysis, we need to determine the behaviour of\nsolutions near the Stokes points, the branch points of the dispersion relation. In the\nneighbourhood of the branch point, we approximate the dispersion relation by:\n1\n\nQ(x) \u2243 1 + Ax 2 .\n\n(23)\n\nThis is unlike the more usual situation in WKB analysis where Q(x) \u2243 x around the\nStokes points. The simplest treatment of the phase matching follows from considering\nA \u226a 1 in which case the A = 0 case can be used as a zeroth order solution in a region\naround the Stokes point. Note that for A = 0, the dispersion relation is independent of\nx and there is no reflection of the wave. As we will see, as A \u2192 0 the reflectivity goes\nto zero. The transmitted part of the wave will be decaying for finite A, so that we have\npartial absorption of the travelling wave.\nOur wave equation is\n1\nd2 y\n2 )y,\n(24)\n=\n\u2212(1\n+\nAx\ndx2\nwith an A = 0 solution\ny0 = e\u00b1ix ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhich motivates the substitution\ny = e\u2212ix+u(x) .\n\n(26)\n\nThe other choice of sign leads to a second solution to the equation, which is growing for\nx \u2192 \u2212\u221e.

We have\nrequired u\u2032 (x) \u226a 1, so an oscillatory u(x) can be modelled as \u01ebe2ix with \u01eb \u226a 1 (plus a\nconstant which can be safely ignored) in which case:\n\u0001\n2ix\ny(x) = e\u2212ix+u(x) = e\u2212ix e\u01ebe \u2243 e\u2212ix 1 + \u01ebe2ix = e\u2212ix + \u01ebeix .\n(30)\nThese correspond to the WKB solutions, which are approximately of the form c1 e\u2212ix +\nc2 eix near the origin. We require that the WKB solution matched on the left-hand\nside have c2 = 0 because the corresponding term grows exponentially for large negative\nx. We therefore must have \u01eb \u2192 0 as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Using the asymptotic expansion of\nerfc = 1 \u2212 erf, as given by equation 7.1.23 of [12], we find the x \u2192 \u2212\u221e limit of equation\n(29), allowing us to express this matching condition as:\n\u221a\nA\n(31)\nC = (1 + i) \u03c0.\n8\nThen we have a solution for y which is asymptotically of the form:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n\u2212ix\nix A \u03c0(1 \u2212 i)\n(32)\ny = P (x) e + e\n4\nfor x \u226b 1, with P (x) a slowly varying function. The phase matching condition is given\nby finding the nodes of these waves, which fixes the WKB phase at x = 0:\n\u221a\n\u2212i\n(1 + i)A \u03c0\nlog(\n).\n(33)\n\u03c60 =\n4\n8\n8.\n\nFinding wavemodes\n\nGlobal modes are found in the usual way: we look for paths C in the complex plane\nR\njoining the axis and boundary where B \u03b1(x)dx is real for any sub-path B of C. These\nR\nR\npaths will be WKB solutions if the integral C \u03b1(x)dx = [0,1] \u03b1(x)dx which can be\nguaranteed if there are no singularities of our differential equation coefficients in the\nregion. In particular, this requires that the circular path C \u2212 [0, 1] does not enclose any\nStokes points. The quantisation condition is supplied by requiring the correct behaviour\nat boundaries. At the origin the WKB wavemode must be matched to a Bessel function,\nand this gives the condition \u03c6|x=0 = \u03c0(1/4+m/2). At the outer boundary of the plasma,\nwe require vr = 0 (fixed plasma boundary), which leads to \u03c6|x=1 = \u03c0/2.\nLocalised modes proceed from the axis or outer boundary of the plasma and propagate\nalong ray trajectories (which will in this case be anti-Stokes lines) to a Stokes point.\nThey are then evanescent past this point, so it must be possible to draw a path\nconnecting the relevant Stokes point to the other boundary without crossing a Stokes\n1\nline. For Stokes points of the form Q(x) = a + bx 2 , which are present in this analysis,\n\n\f12\n\nINCOMPRESSIBLE LIMIT FOR RESISTIVE PLASMAS\n\nwe have a complex phase matching criterion. The phase integral between the Stokes\npoint and the boundary is then required to be complex for matching to occur. This\nmeans that we cannot follow anti-Stokes lines, along which the phase is real, exactly to\njoin the boundary and the Stokes point. The complex portion of the phase leads to a\ncorrection to the path, which must be taken into account.\n9.

The other two branches then produce the two forks.\nThe eigenvalues are displayed in figure 5, together with the numerical result from a code\nbased on [8].

Here we\nhave two solutions for \u03b1(\u03c9) such that \u03b11 \u2243 \u2212\u03b10 , and the two WKB solutions consist of\nwaves of opposite helicity. Finite pressure gradients in this equilibrium result in waves\nof opposite helicity having slightly different frequencies.\n10. Effects of the \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e approximation\nThe reason why we see a pair of loci in 1(e), rather than the single locus usually depicted\nfor compressible spectra (e.g. figure 1(a)) is that in this incompressible model (the limit\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u221e) there are two classes of wavemodes present which can be excited at the Alfv\u00e9n\nfrequency. In a uniform field these wavemodes are degenerate: they oscillate at the same\nfrequency. However the two frequencies are split when the plasma contains currents\nperpendicular to the magnetic field (i.e. in non-force-free plasmas). In the compressible\nmodel at low \u03b2, these two degrees of freedom correspond to the slow (magnetosonic)\nand Alfv\u00e9n wavemodes and the ratio between slow frequencies and Alfv\u00e9n frequencies\nis of order \u03b2 1/2 .\nForce-free models are important special cases, in which pairs of loci of eigenvalues\ncoincide. The \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e approximation will still result in unphysical eigenmodes. We\nnote the paper of Ryu and Grimm [4], which uses this incompressibility assumption\nto analyse a case with finite pressure gradients where we should see a double locus\nstructure. We nevertheless see a simple fork structure. We believe that the splitting\neffect is rather small in this case, so that what looks like one fuzzy locus is in fact a\ndouble locus.\n11. Conclusions\nIn plasma physics an assumption of incompressibility is often justified because the\nparallel dynamics of the plasma and the fluid compression across the field are much\nless important than the forces due to the magnetic field. For example, incompressibility\ndoes not generally affect ideal MHD marginal stability (but this does not extend to\nresistive MHD [13]).\nTwo incompressible resistive MHD models were compared with the physical\ncompressible model by analysis of their spectra. For the first model, where the ratio\nof specific heat is taken to infinity, we expect from local analysis to find two types of\nwavemodes present at the Alfv\u00e9n frequency. In the second model where we again set\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u221e, the parallel plasma inertia is set to zero, and we expect only one Alfv\u00e9nic\nmode to be present in the spectrum, corresponding to the physical case. Numerical\ncomputation of the spectra of a magnetic shear-free plasma confirms that the second\nmodel reproduces most of the eigenmodes associated with the Alfv\u00e9nic model correctly.\nThe first model has twice as many modes present at the Alfv\u00e9n timescale.\nIt is noted that in general most of the modes resolved do not correspond to Alfv\u00e9n\n\n\fINCOMPRESSIBLE LIMIT FOR RESISTIVE PLASMAS\n\n14\n\nmodes and have no physical significance. The shape of an incompressible spectrum for\na more general model, with shear present, was determined numerically and by WKB\nanalysis. The unusual nature of the local dispersion relation leads to a complex structure\nof loci. The resulting spectrum included the 'double locus' of the zero shear model and\nalso demonstrated the fork structure that is seen generically for stable resistive MHD\nspectra.\nThere are many qualitative features of the resistive Alfv\u00e9n spectrum that can be\nreproduced by simply setting \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e. Unfortunately, physical wavemodes and\nfrequencies are not well modelled in this approximation. The stable part of the ideal\nAlfv\u00e9n spectrum is irreparably mixed with spurious modes in this limit. However,\nby using an anisotropic mass density tensor, an incompressibility constraint can be\nintroduced while preserving the Alfv\u00e9n modes.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been supported by the Flinders Institute for Science and Technology, the\nAustralian Institute for Nuclear Science and Engineering and the Australian Partnership\nfor Advanced Computing.\n\nReferences\n[1] Borba, D., Reidel, K.
