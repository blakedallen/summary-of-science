This paper presents three results on F -singularities. First, we give\na new proof of Eisenstein's restriction theorem for adjoint ideal sheaves, using\nthe theory of F -singularities. Second, we show that a conjecture of Musta\u0163\u0103 and\nSrinivas [20, Conjecture 1.1] implies a conjectural correspondence of F -purity and\nlog canonicity. Finally, we prove this correspondence when the defining equations\nof the variety are very general.\n\nIntroduction\nThis paper deals with the theory of F -singularities, which are singularities defined\nusing the Frobenius morphism in positive characteristic. We present three main results. First, we give a new proof of a restriction theorem for adjoint ideal sheaves.\nSecond, we show that a certain arithmetic conjecture implies a conjectural correspondence of F -purity and log canonicity. Finally, we prove this correspondence\nwhen the defining equations of the variety are very general.\nThe notion of the adjoint ideal sheaf along a normal Q-Gorenstein closed subvariety X of a smooth complex variety A with codimension c was introduced in [34] (see\nDefinition 1.8 for its definition). It is a modification of the multiplier ideal sheaf associated to the pair (A, cX) and encodes much information on the singularities of X.\nEisenstein [3] recently proved a restriction theorem for these adjoint ideal sheaves.\nIn this paper, we give a new proof of his result, using the theory of F -singularities.\nBuilding on earlier results [7], [30] and [33], the author introduced in [34] a positive\ncharacteristic analogue of the adjoint ideal sheaf, called the test ideal sheaf (see\nDefinition 1.1). He conjectured that the adjoint ideal sheaf coincides, after reduction\nto characteristic p \u226b 0, with the test ideal sheaf, and some partial results were\nobtained in loc. cit. Making use of these results, we reduce the problem to an ideal\ntheoretic problem on a normal Q-Gorenstein ring essentially of finite type over a\nperfect field of characteristic p > 0. The desired restriction formula is then obtained\nby adapting the argument of [23] (which can be traced back to [4]) to our setting\n(see Theorem 3.2). As a corollary, we show the correspondence between adjoint\nideal sheaves and test ideal sheaves in a full generality:\nCorollary 3.4. Let t > 0 be a real number and Z be a proper closed subscheme of A\nwhich does not contain X in the support. We denote by adjX (A, tZ) the adjoint ideal\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

If \u03c4eXp (Ap , tZp ) is the test ideal sheaf of\n(Ap , tZp ) along Xp , then\n\u03c4eXp (Ap , tZp ) = adjX (A, tZ)p .\n\nThe other ingredients of this paper are on a correspondence between F -pure singularities and log canonical singularities. F -pure singularities are defined via splitting\nof Frobenius morphisms (see Definition 1.3). Log canonical singularities form a class\nof singularities associated to the minimal model program (see Definition 1.7). It is\nknown that the pair (X; tZ) is log canonical if its modulo p reduction (Xp ; tZp ) is\nF -pure for infinitely many primes p, and the converse is conjectural (see Conjecture\n2.4 for the precise statement). This conjecture is widely open and only a few special\ncases are known. On the other hand, Musta\u0163\u0103\u2013Srinivas [20, Conjecture 1.1] proposed\nthe following more arithmetic conjecture to study a behavior of test ideal sheaves:\nif V is a d-dimensional smooth projective variety over an algebraically closed field\nof characteristic zero, then the action induced by the Frobenius morphism on the\ncohomology group H d (Vp , OVp ) of its modulo p reduction Vp is bijective for infinitely\nmany primes p. In this paper, we show that their conjecture implies the correspondence of F -purity and log canonicity (see Theorem 2.11). Our result can be\nviewed as strong evidence in favor of this conjectural correspondence, although the\nconjecture of Musta\u0163\u0103\u2013Srinivas is also largely open.\nAs additional evidence of this correspondence, we consider the case when the\ndefining equations of X are very general. Shibuta and the author [28] proved the\ncorrespondence if X = Cn and Z is a complete intersection binomial subscheme or\na space monomial curve. Using a similar idea, Hern\u00e1ndez [8] recently proved the\ncase when X = Cn and Z is a hypersurface of X such that the coefficients of terms\nof its defining equation are algebraically independent over Q. Using the techniques\nwe have developed for Theorem 3.2, we generalize his result as follows:\nTheorem 4.1. Let X \u2286 Cn = Spec C[x1 , . . . , xn ] be a normal Q-Gorenstein closed\nsubvariety of codimension c passing through the origin 0. Let r denote the Gorenstein\nindex of X and JX denote the l.c.i. defect ideal of X. Let a \u2286 OX be a nonzero\nideal and t > 0 be a real number. Suppose that there exist a system of generators\nh1 , . . . , hl for the defining ideal IX of X and a system of generators hl+1 , . . . , h\u03bd for\na with the following property: for each i = 1, . . . , \u03bd, we can write\n\u03c1i\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(1)\n(n)\nX\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n(1)\n(n)\n\u03b3ij x1 ij * * * xnij \u2208 C[x1 , . . . , xn ] (\u03b1ij , . . . , \u03b1ij ) \u2208 Zn\u22650 \\ {0}, \u03b3ij \u2208 C\u2217 ,\nhi =\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03b3i1 , . . . , \u03b3i\u03c1i are algebraically independent over Q. Then (X; tV (a) + 1r V (JX ))\nis log canonical at 0 if and only if its modulo p reduction is F -pure at 0 for infinitely\nmany primes p.\nAcknowledgments.

Preliminaries\n1.1. Test ideals and F -singularities of pairs. In this subsection, we briefly\nreview the definitions of test ideal sheaves and F -singularities of pairs. The reader\nis referred to [22], [23], [24], [31] and [34] for the details.\nThroughout this paper, all schemes are Noetherian, excellent and separated, and\nall sheaves are coherent. Let A be an integral scheme of prime characteristic p. For\neach integer e \u2265 1, we denote by F e : A \u2192 A or F e : OA \u2192 F\u2217e OA the e-th iteration\nof the absolute Frobenius morphism on A. We say that A is F -finite if F : A \u2192 A\nis a finite morphism. For example, every scheme essentially of finite type over a\nperfect field is F -finite. Given an ideal sheaf I \u2286 OA , for each q = pe , we denote by\nI [q] \u2286 OA the ideal sheaf identified with I * F\u2217e OA via the identification F\u2217e OA \u223c\n= OA .\nFor a closed subscheme Y of A, we denote by IY the defining ideal sheaf of Y in X.\nThe notion of test ideal sheaves along arbitrary subvarieties was introduced in\n[34]. Below we give an alternate description of these sheaves based upon the ideas\nof [23]. Let A be a normal Q-Gorenstein variety over an F -finite field of characteristic\np > 0 and X \u2286 A be a reduced equidimensional closed subscheme of codimension\nc. Suppose that the Gorenstein index of A is not divisible by p. There then exists\ninfinitely many e such that (pe \u2212 1)KA is Cartier, and we fix such an integer e0 \u2265 1.\nGrothendieck duality yields an isomorphism of F\u2217e0 OA -modules\nF e0 OA \u223c\n= H omO (F e0 ((1 \u2212 pe0 )KA ), OA ),\n\u2217\n\nA\n\n\u2217\n\nand we denote by\n\u03c6A,e0 : F\u2217e0 OA ((1 \u2212 pe0 )KA ) \u2192 OA\nthe map corresponding to the global section 1 of OA via this isomorphism. When A\nis Gorenstein, we can describe \u03c6A,e0 more explicitly: it is obtained by tensoring the\ncanonical dual (F e0 )\u2228 : F\u2217e0 \u03c9A \u2192 \u03c9A of the e0 -times iterated Frobenius morphism\nF e0 : OA \u2192 F\u2217e0 OA with OA (\u2212KA ). Also, the composite map\n\u03c6A,e0 \u25e6 F\u2217e0 \u03c6A,e0 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 F\u2217(n\u22121)e0 \u03c6A,e0 : F\u2217ne0 OA ((1 \u2212 pne0 )KA ) \u2192 OA .\nis denoted by \u03c6A,ne0 for all integers n \u2265 1. Just for convenience, \u03c6A,0 is defined to\nbe the identity map OA \u2192 OA .\nProposition-Definition\n1.1 (cf. [34, Definition 2.2]). Let the notation be as above\nP\nand let Z = m\nt\nZ\nbe\na formal combination where the ti are nonnegative real\ni=1 i i\nnumbers and the Zi are proper closed subschemes of A which do not contain any\ncomponent of X in their support.\n(1) There exists a unique smallest ideal sheaf J \u2286 OA whose support does not\ncontain any component of X and which satisfies\nc(pne0 \u22121) \u2308t1 (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\nIZ1\n\n\u03c6A,ne0 (F\u2217ne0 (JIX\n\n\u2308t (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\n\n* * * IZmm\n\nOA ((1 \u2212 pne0 )KA ))) \u2286 J\n\nfor all integers n \u2265 1. This ideal sheaf is denoted by \u03c4eX (A, Z). When X = \u2205\n(resp. Z = \u2205), we denote this ideal sheaf simply by \u03c4e(A; Z) (resp. \u03c4eX (A)).\n\n\f4\n\nSHUNSUKE TAKAGI\n\n(2) (A, Z) is said to be purely F -regular along X if \u03c4eX (A, Z) = OA .\n\nProof. We will prove that \u03c4eX (A, Z) always exists. First we suppose that A is affine,\nOA ((1\u2212pne0 )KA ) \u223c\n= OA and HomOA (F\u2217e0 OA , OA ) is generated by \u03c6A,e0 as an F\u2217e0 OA module. Then HomOA (F\u2217ne0 OA , OA ) is generated by \u03c6A,ne0 as an F\u2217ne0 OA -module\nfor all n \u2265 1. Here we use the following claim.\nClaim. There exists an element \u03b3 \u2208 OA not contained in any minimal prime ideal\nof IX and satisfying the following property: for every \u03b4 \u2208 OA not contained in any\nminimal prime of IX , there exists an integer n \u2265 1 such that\nc(pne0 \u22121) \u2308t (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\n\n\u2308t (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\n\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u03c6A,ne0 (F\u2217ne0 (\u03b4IX\nIZ11\n* * * IZmm\n)).\nT\nProof. Suppose that g \u2208 i IZi is an element not contained in any minimal prime of\nIX such that D(g) X \u2286 X is regular. By [34, Example 2.6], D(g) is purely F -regular\nalong D(g) X . It then follows from an argument similar to [24, Proposition 3.21]\nthat some power of g satisfies the condition of the claim.\n\u0003\nLet \u03b3 \u2208 OA be an element satisfying the conditions of the above claim. Then we\nwill show that\nX\nc(pne0 \u22121) \u2308t1 (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\n\u2308t (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\n\u03c4eX (A, Z) =\n\u03c6A,ne0 (F\u2217ne0 (\u03b3IX\nIZ1\n* * * IZmm\n)).\nn\u22650\n\nP\nc(pne0 \u22121) \u2308t1 (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\n\u2308t (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\nIt is easy to check that n\u22650 \u03c6A,ne0 (F\u2217ne0 (\u03b3IX\nIZ1\n* * * IZmm\n)) is\nthe smallest ideal J \u2286 OA containing \u03b3 and satisfying\nc(pne0 \u22121) \u2308t1 (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\nIZ1\n\n\u03c6A,ne0 (F\u2217ne0 (JIX\n\n\u2308t (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\n\n* * * IZmm\n\n)) \u2286 J\n\nfor all n \u2265 1. On the other hand, if an ideal I \u2286 OA is not contained in any minimal\nprime of IX and satisfying\nc(pne0 \u22121) \u2308t1 (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\nIZ1\n\n\u03c6A,ne0 (F\u2217ne0 (IIX\n\n\u2308t (pne0 \u22121)\u2309\n\n* * * IZmm\n\n)) \u2286 I\n\nfor all n \u2265 1, then \u03b3 is forced to be in I by definition. This complete the proof when\nA is affine and HomOA (F\u2217e0 OA , OA ) is generated by \u03c6A,e0 as an F\u2217e0 OA -module.\nIn the general case, \u03c4eX (A, Z) is obtained by gluing the constructions on affine\ncharts.\n\u0003\nRemark 1.2.

Reduction from characteristic zero to characteristic p\nIn this section, we briefly review how to reduce things from characteristic zero\ncharacteristic p > 0. Our main references are [10, Chapter 2] and [20, Section 3.2].\nPLet X be a scheme of finite type over a field K of characteristic zero and Z =\ni ti Zi be a formal combination where the ti are real numbers and the Zi are proper\nclosed subschemes of X. Choosing a suitable finitely generated Z-subalgebra B of\nK, we can construct a scheme XB of finite type over B and closed subschemes\nZi,B ( XB such that there exist isomorphisms\nXO\n\u001f?\n\nZi\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n/\n\n/\n\nXB \u00d7Spec B Spec K\nO\n\n\u001f?\n\nZi,B \u00d7Spec B Spec K.\n\nNote that we can enlarge B by localizing at a single nonzero element and replacing\nXB and Zi,B with the corresponding open subschemes. Thus, applying the generic\nfreeness [10, (2.1.4)],\nwe may assume that XB and the Zi,B are flat over Spec B.\nP\nLetting ZB := i ti Zi,B , we refer to (XB , ZB ) as a model of (X, Z) over B. Given a\nclosed point \u03bc \u2208 SpecP\nB, we denote by X\u03bc (resp. Zi,\u03bc ) the fiber of XB (resp. Zi,B ) over\n\u03bc and denote Z\u03bc := i ti Zi,\u03bc . Then X\u03bc is a scheme of finite type over the residue\nfield \u03ba(\u03bc) of \u03bc, which is a finite field of characteristic p(\u03bc). If X is regular, then\nafter possibly enlarging B, we may assume that XB is regular. In particular, there\nexists a dense open subset W \u2286 Spec B such that X\u03bc is regular for all closed points\n\n\f8\n\nSHUNSUKE TAKAGI\n\n\u03bc \u2208 W . Similarly, if X is normal (resp. reduced, irreducible, locally a complete\nintersection, Gorenstein, Q-Gorenstein of index r, Cohen-Macaulay), then so is X\u03bc\nfor general closed points \u03bc \u2208 Spec B. Also, dim X = dim X\u03bc and codim(Zi , X) =\ncodim(Zi,\u03bc , X\u03bc ) for general closed points \u03bc \u2208 Spec B. In particular, if X is normal\nand Z is an Q-Weil (resp. Q-Cartier) divisor on X, then Z\u03bc is an Q-Weil (resp. QCartier) divisor on X\u03bc for general closed points \u03bc \u2208 Spec B. If KX is a canonical\ndivisor on X, then KX,\u03bc gives a canonical divisor KX\u03bc on X\u03bc for general closed\npoints \u03bc \u2208 Spec B.\nGiven a morphism f : X \u2192 Y of schemes of finite type over K and a model\n(XB , YB ) of (X, Y ) over B, after possibly enlarging B, we may assume that f is\ninduced by a morphism fB : XB \u2192 YB of schemes of finite type over B. Given a\nclosed point \u03bc \u2208 Spec B, we obtain a corresponding morphism f\u03bc : X\u03bc \u2192 Y\u03bc of\nschemes of finite type over \u03ba(\u03bc). If f is projective (resp. finite), then so is f\u03bc for\ngeneral closed points \u03bc \u2208 Spec B.\nDefinition 2.1.

(1) By enlarging B, ((X, D); Z) is of P type if and only if for some\nmodel over B, P holds for all closed points \u03bc \u2208 Spec B.\n(2) When P is strong F -regularity, pure F -regularity, or sharp F -purity, the above\ndefinition is independent of the choice of a model.\nThere exists a correspondence between adjoint ideal sheaves and test ideal sheaves.\nTheorem 2.3 ([33, Theorem 5.3], cf. [7], [30]).\nP Let X be a normal variety over a\nfield K of characteristic zero and let Z = i ti Zi be a formal combination where\nthe ti areP\nnonnegative real numbers and the Zi are proper closed subschemes of X.\nLet D = j dj Dj be a boundary divisor on X such that KX + D is Q-Cartier and\nno component of \u230aD\u230b is contained in the support of the Zi . Given any model of\n(X, Z, D) over a finitely generated Z-subalgebra B of K, there exists a dense open\nsubset W \u2286 Spec B such that\nadjD (X, Z)\u03bc = \u03c4eD\u03bc (X\u03bc , Z\u03bc )\n\nfor every closed point \u03bc \u2208 W .

Let X be a normal variety over an algebraically closed field K\nof characteristic zeroP\nand D be an effective Q-divisor on X such that KX + D is\nQ-Cartier. Let Z = i ti Zi be a formal combination where the ti are nonnegative\nrational numbers and the Zi are proper closed subschemes of X. Fix an arbitrary\npoint x \u2208 X.\n(1) ((X, D); Z) is log canonical at x if and only if it is of dense sharply F -pure\ntype at x.\n(2) Suppose that (X, D) is log canonical at x. Given any model of (X, D, Z, x)\nover a finitely generated Z-subalgebra B of K, there exists a dense subset of\nclosed points W \u2286 Spec B such that\nlctx ((X, D); Z) = fptx\u03bc ((X\u03bc , D\u03bc ); Z\u03bc )\nfor all \u03bc \u2208 W .\nRemark 2.5. (1) It is easy to see that (1) implies (2) in Conjecture 2.4.\n(2) If ((X, D); Z) is of dense sharply F -pure type at x, then by [6, Theorem 3.3]\nand [31, Proposition 3.8], it is log canonical at x.\nRemark 2.6. Conjecture 2.4 is known to hold in the following cases (see also Theorem\n4.1):\n(i) X is a Q-Gorenstein toric variety, D = 0 and the Zi are monomial subschemes.\n(ii) X is the affine space AnK , D = 0 and Z = t1 Z1 where Z1 is a binomial complete\nintersection subscheme or a space monomial curve (in the latter case, n = 3).\n(iii) X is a normal surface, D is an integral effective divisor on X and Z = \u2205.\n(iv) X is the affine space AnK , D = 0 and Z is a hypersurface of X such that the\ncoefficients of terms of its defining equation are algebraically independent over\nQ.\nThe case (i) follows from [1, Theorem 3], the case (ii) does from [28, Theorem 0.1]\nand the case (iv) does from [8, Theorem 5.16]. We explain here how to check the\ncase (iii). If D 6= 0, then it follows from comparing [6, Theorem 4.5] with [15,\nTheorem 9.6]. So we consider the case where D = 0. By Remark 2.5, it suffices\nto show that a two-dimensional log canonical singularity (X, x) is of dense F -pure\ntype. Passing to an index one cover, we may assume that (X, x) is Gorenstein. If it\nis log terminal, then by [5, Theorem 5.2] (see also Theorem 2.3), it is of F -regular\ntype and, in particular, of dense F -pure type. Hence we can assume that (X, x) is\nnot log terminal, that is, (X, x) is a cusp singularity or a simple elliptic singularity.\nBy [18, Theorem 1.2] or [35, Theorem 1.7], cusp singularities are of dense F -pure\ntype. Also, by [18], a simple elliptic singularity with exceptional elliptic curve E is\nof dense F -pure type if and only if for a model EB of E over a finitely generated\nZ-subalgebra B \u2286 K, there exists a dense subset of closed points W \u2286 Spec B such\nthat E\u03bc is ordinary for all \u03bc \u2208 W . Applying the same argument as the proof of\n[20, Proposition 5.3], we may assume that E is defined over Q. It then follows from\nSerre's ordinary reduction theorem [27] that such W always exists. Thus, simple\nelliptic singularities are of dense F -pure type.\nLemma 2.7. In order to prove Conjecture 2.4, it is enough to consider the case\nwhen Z = \u2205.\n\n\f10\n\nSHUNSUKE TAKAGI\n\nProof. Since the question is local, we work in a sufficiently small neighborhood of x.\nBy Remark 2.5, it suffices to show that if ((X, D); Z) is log canonical, then it is of\ndense sharply F -pure type.\nSuppose that ((X, D); Z) is log canonical. Let hi,1 , . . . , hi,mi be a system of\ngenerators for IZi for each i. Let gi,1 , . . . , gi,mi be general\nQ i linear combinations\nof hi,1 , . . . , hi,mi with coefficients in K, and set gi = m\nj=1 gi,j , so that (X, D +\nP ti\ndiv (g )) is log canonical. On the other hand, since gi \u2208 IZmii , if (X, D +\nPi mti i X i\nis ((X, D); Z). Therefore,\ni mi divX (gi )) is of dense sharply F -pure type, then so P\nit is enough to show that the log canonical pair (X, D + i mtii divX (gi )) is of dense\nsharply F -pure type.\n\u0003\nMusta\u0163\u0103 and Srinivas [20] recently proposed the following more arithmetic conjecture and related it to another conjecture on a comparison between multiplier ideal\nsheaves and test ideal sheaves.\nConjecture 2.8 ([20, Conjecture 1.1]). Let X be an n-dimensional smooth projective variety over Q. Given a model of X over a finitely generated Z-subalgebra B\nof Q, there exists a dense subset of closed points W \u2286 Spec B such that the action\ninduced by Frobenius on H n (X\u03bc , OX\u03bc ) is bijective for all \u03bc \u2208 W .\nRemark 2.9. Conjecture 2.8 is known to be true when X is a smooth projective\ncurve of genus less than or equal to two (see [20, Example 5.5], which can be traced\nback to [21], [27]) or a smooth projective surface of Kodaira dimension zero (see [12,\nProposition 2.3]).\nExample 2.10.

If Conjecture 2.8 holds, then Conjecture 2.4 holds as well.\nIn order to prove Theorem 2.11, we introduce a notion of sharp F -purity for\nnon-effective integral divisors.\nDefinition 2.12. Let X be an F -finite normal integral scheme of characteristic\np > 0 and D be a (not necessarily effective) integral divisor on X. We assume that\nKX + D is Q-Cartier with index not divisible by p. Let x \u2208 X be an arbitrary point.\nWe decompose D as D = D+ \u2212 D\u2212 , where D+ and D\u2212 are effective integral divisors\non X which have no common irreducible components. We then say that the pair\n(X, D) is sharply F -pure at x if there exists an integer e0 > 0 such that for all positive\nmultiples e = ne0 of e0 , one has an OX,x -linear map \u03c6 : F\u2217e OX ((pe \u2212 1)D+ + D\u2212 )x \u2192\nOX (D\u2212 )x whose image of F\u2217e OX (D\u2212 )x contains 1. We say that (X, D) is sharply\nF -pure if it is sharply F -pure at every closed point of X.\nIf D is an effective integral divisor, then this definition coincides with Definition\n1.3 (ii). We need a variant of [26, Theorem 6.28] involving sharp F -purity in the\nsense of Definition 2.12.\nLemma 2.13 (cf. [26, Theorem 6.28]). Let \u03c0 : Y \u2192 X be a finite separable morphism of F -finite normal integral schemes of characteristic p > 0. Let \u2206X be an\neffective Q-divisor on X such that KX + \u2206X is Q-Cartier with index not divisible by\np. Suppose that \u2206Y is an integral divisor on Y such that KY + \u2206Y = \u03c0 \u2217 (KX + \u2206X ).\nIn addition, we assume that the trace map TrY /X : \u03c0\u2217 OY \u2192 OX is surjective. Then\n(X, \u2206X ) is sharply F -pure if and only if (Y, \u2206Y ) is sharply F -pure in the sense of\nDefinition 2.12.\nProof. The statement is local on X and so we assume that X = Spec A and Y =\nSpec B, where A is a local ring and B is a semi-local ring. There exists e0 \u2208 N\nsuch that (pe0 \u2212 1)(KX + \u2206) is Cartier. Then HomA (F\u2217e A((pe \u2212 1)\u2206X ), A) is a free\nF\u2217e A-module of rank one for all positive multiples e = ne0 of e0 . Let \u03c6X : F\u2217e A \u2192 A\nbe its generator. We decompose \u2206Y as \u2206Y,+ \u2212 \u2206Y,\u2212 , where \u2206Y,+ , \u2206Y,\u2212 are effective\nintegral divisors on Y which have no common components. Then the F\u2217e B-module\nHomB (F e B((pe \u2212 1)\u2206Y,+ + \u2206Y,\u2212 ), B(\u2206Y,\u2212 )) \u223c\n= F e B((1 \u2212 pe )(KY + \u2206Y ))\n\u2217\n\n=\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u2217\nF\u2217e \u03c0 \u2217 A((1 \u2212 pe )(KX\nF\u2217e \u03c0 \u2217 A = F\u2217e B,\n\n+ \u2206X ))\n\n\f12\n\nSHUNSUKE TAKAGI\n\nand we pick its generator \u03c6Y : F\u2217e B(\u2206Y,\u2212 ) \u2192 B(\u2206Y,\u2212 ) extending \u03c6X : F\u2217e A \u2192 A.\nSuppose that (X, \u2206X ) is sharply F -pure. By the definition of sharp F -purity,\nafter possibly enlarging e, we have that 1 \u2208 Im \u03c6X \u2286 Im \u03c6Y , and hence (Y, \u2206Y ) is\nsharply F -pure.\nConversely, suppose that (Y, \u2206Y ) is sharply F -pure. Making e larger if necessary,\nwe may assume that 1 \u2208 Im \u03c6Y . Note that \u2206Y = \u03c0 \u2217 \u2206X \u2212 R and R \u2265 \u2206Y,\u2212 , where\nR denotes the ramification divisor of \u03c0. Then the F\u2217e B-module\nHomB (F\u2217e B((pe \u2212 1)\u03c0 \u2217 \u2206X + R), B(R))\n\u223c\n=F\u2217e \u03c0 \u2217 A((1 \u2212 pe )(KX + \u2206X ))\n\u223c\n= HomB (F e B((pe \u2212 1)\u2206Y,+ + \u2206Y,\u2212 ), B(\u2206Y,\u2212 )),\n\u2217\n\nand we pick its generator \u03c6\neY : F\u2217e B(R) \u2192 B(R) extending \u03c6Y : F\u2217e B(\u2206Y,\u2212 ) \u2192\nB(\u2206Y,\u2212 ). Since the trace map TrY /X corresponds to the ramification divisor R, we\nhave the following commutative diagram:\nF\u2217e A\n\n\u03c6X\n\n/\n\nO\n\nF\u2217e TrY /X\n\nF\u2217e B(R)\n\nAO\nTrY /X\n\n\u03c6\neY\n\n/\n\nB(R).\n\nThe surjectivity of the trace map TrY /X : B \u2192 A implies that\n1 \u2208 TrY /X (Im \u03c6Y ) \u2286 TrY /X (Im \u03c6\neY ) = \u03c6X (Im F\u2217e TrY /X ) = Im \u03c6X ,\n\nbecause B \u2286 Im \u03c6Y . Thus, (X, \u2206X ) is sharply F -pure.\n\n\u0003\n\nProof of Theorem 2.11. Let the notation be as in Conjecture 2.4. By Lemma 2.7,\nwe may assume that KX + D is Cartier and Z = \u2205. Since the question is local, we\nwork in a sufficiently small neighborhood of x. By Remark 2.5, it suffices to show\nthat if (X, D) is log canonical, then it is of dense sharply F -pure type.\nSuppose that (X, D) is log canonical. By [16, Section 2.4], there exists a finite\nmorphism f : X \u2032 \u2192 X from a normal variety X \u2032 over K such that f \u2217 (KX + D)\nis Cartier. Let D \u2032 be a (not necessarily effective) integral divisor on X \u2032 such that\nKX \u2032 + D \u2032 = f \u2217 (KX + D). It then follows from [16, Proposition 5.20] that (X \u2032 , D \u2032 ) is\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nlog canonical. We decompose D \u2032 as D \u2032 = D+\n\u2212 D\u2212\n, where D+\nand D\u2212\nare effective\nintegral divisors on X which have no common components. Take a log resolution\ne \u2192 X \u2032 of (X \u2032 , D \u2032 ), and denote by E the reduced divisor supported on the \u03c0\u03c0:X\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nexceptional locus Exc(\u03c0). Let (XB , DB , XB\u2032 , DB\n= D+,B\n\u2212 D\u2212,B\n, \u03c0B , EB ) be a model\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nof (X, D, X , D = D+ \u2212 D\u2212 , \u03c0, E) over a finitely generated Z-subalgebra B of K.\nAfter possibly enlarging B, we may assume that KX\u03bc + D\u03bc is Q-Cartier with index\nnot divisible by the characteristic p(\u03bc) and that the trace map TrX\u03bc\u2032 /X\u03bc : f\u03bc \u2217 OX\u03bc\u2032 \u2192\nOX\u03bc is surjective for all closed points \u03bc \u2208 Spec B.\nBy virtue of [20, Theorem 5.10], there exists a dense subset of closed points\nW \u2286 Spec B such that for every integer e \u2265 1 and every \u03bc \u2208 W , the map\n(\u22c4)\n\n\u22121 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c0\u03bc \u2217 F\u2217e (OXe\u03bc (KXe\u03bc + \u03c0\u03bc \u22121\ne\u03bc + \u03c0\u03bc \u2217 D+,\u03bc + E\u03bc ),\ne\u03bc (KX\n\u2217 D+,\u03bc + E\u03bc )) \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc \u2217 OX\n\n\fA CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN LOG CANONICITY AND F -PURITY\n\n13\n\ninduced by the canonical dual of the e-times iterated Frobenius map OXe\u03bc \u2192 F\u2217e OXe\u03bc ,\nis surjective. Tensoring (\u22c4) with OX\u03bc\u2032 (\u2212KX\u03bc\u2032 \u2212 D\u03bc\u2032 ), one can see that the map\n\u03c1 : \u03c0\u03bc \u2217 F\u2217e (OXe\u03bc (M + (1 \u2212 p(\u03bc)e )\u03c0\u03bc\u2217 (KX\u03bc\u2032 + D\u03bc\u2032 ))) \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc \u2217 OXe\u03bc (M)\n\u2032\n\u2217\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nis surjective, where M = KXf\u03bc + \u03c0\u03bc \u22121\n\u2217 D+,\u03bc \u2212\u03c0\u03bc (KX\u03bc + D\u03bc ) + E\u03bc .

Let Y be an S2, G1 and seminormal variety over an algebraically\nclosed field K of characteristic zero and \u0393 be an effective Q-Weil divisorial sheaf\non Y such that KY + \u0393 is Q-Cartier. Combining Theorem 2.11 with [19, Corollary\n4.4], we can conclude that if Conjecture 2.8 holds, then the pair (Y, \u0393) is semi-log\ncanonical if and only if it is of dense sharply F -pure type.\n3. Restriction theorem for adjoint ideal sheaves\nIn this section, building on an earlier work [34], we give a new proof of Eisenstein's\nrestriction theorem for adjoint ideal sheaves using test ideal sheaves.\nDefinition 3.1. Let A be a smooth variety over an algebraically closed field K\nof characteristic zero and X \u2286 A be a normal Q-Gorenstein closed subvariety of\ncodimension c. Denote by r the Gorenstein index of X, that is, the smallest positive\ninteger m such that mKX is Cartier. Then the l.c.i. defect ideal sheaf 1 JX \u2286 OX\nis defined as follows: since the construction is local, we may consider the germ at\na closed point x \u2208 X \u2286 A. We take generally a closed subscheme Y of A which\ncontains X and is locally a complete intersection (l.c.i. for short) of codimension c.\nBy Bertini's theorem, Y is the scheme-theoretic union of X and another variety C Y\nof codimension c. Then the closed subscheme D Y := C Y X of X is a Weil divisor\nsuch that rD Y is Cartier and OX (rKX ) = OX (\u2212rD Y )\u03c9Y\u2297r . The l.c.i. defect ideal\nsheaf JX is defined by\nX\nJX =\nOX (\u2212rD Y ),\nY\n\nwhere Y runs through all the general l.c.i. closed subschemes of codimension c containing X. Note that the support of JX exactly coincides with the non-l.c.i. locus\n1We\n\nfollow a construction due to Kawakita [14], but our terminology is slightly different from\nhis. We warn the reader that the ideal sheaf called the l.c.i. defect ideal in [14] is different from\nour JX . Also, Ein and Musta\u0163\u0103 [2] introduced a very similar ideal, which coincides with our JX\nup to integral closure.\n\n\f14\n\nSHUNSUKE TAKAGI\n\nof X. In particular, JX = OX if and only if X is l.c.i. The reader is referred to [14,\nSection 2] and [2, Section 9.2] for further properties of l.c.i. defect ideal sheaves.\nNow we give a new proof of Eisenstein's theorem [3, Corollary 5.2].\nTheorem 3.2. Let A be a smooth\nPm variety over an algebraically closed field K of\ncharacteristic zero and Z =\ni=1 ti Zi be a formal combination where the ti are\nnonnegative real numbers and the Zi are proper closed subschemes of A. If X is a\nnormal Q-Gorenstein closed subvariety of A which is not contained in the support\nof any Zi , then\n1\nJ (X, Z X + V (JX )) = adjX (A, Z) X ,\nr\nwhere r is the Gorenstein index of X and JX is the l.c.i. defect ideal sheaf of X.\nProof. The proof is a refinement of the proof of [34, Theorem 3.1]. The inclusion\nJ (X, Z X + 1r V (JX )) \u2287 adjX (A, Z) X follows from a combination of [2, Remark 8.5]\nand [34, Lemma 1.7]. Hence we will prove the converse inclusion.\nTmSince the question is local, we consider the germ at a closed point x \u2208 X \u2229\ni=1 Zi \u2282 A. Denote by c the codimension of X in A. Take generally a subscheme\nY of A which contains X and is l.c.i. of codimension c, so Y is the scheme-theoretic\nunion of X and a variety C Y . Then D Y := C Y X is a Weil divisor on X such that\nrD Y is Cartier. By a general choice of Y , one has\n1\n(\u22c6)\nJ (X, Z X + V (JX )) = adjDY (X, Z X ),\nr\n(which follows from an argument similar to the claim in the proof of [34, Theorem\n3.1]). Therefore, it is enough to show that\nadjDY (X, Z\n\nX\n\n) \u2286 adjX (A, Z)\n\nX\n\n.\n\nBy Theorem 2.3 and [34, Theorem 2.7], in order to prove this inclusion, it suffices\nto show that given any model of (A, X, Y, Z, C Y , D Y ) over a finitely generated Zsubalgebra B of K, one has\n(\u22c6\u22c6)\n\n\u03c4eD\u03bcY (X\u03bc , Z\u03bc\n\nX\u03bc\n\n) \u2286 \u03c4eX\u03bc (A\u03bc , Z\u03bc )\n\nX\u03bc\n\nfor general closed points \u03bc \u2208 Spec B. Since \u03bc is a general point of Spec B and the\nformation of test ideal sheaves commutes with localization, we may assume that\nOA\u03bc is an F -finite regular local ring of characteristic p = p(\u03bc) > r, X\u03bc = V (I)\nis a normal Q-Gorenstein closed subscheme of A\u03bc with Gorenstein index r and\nY\u03bc = V ((f1 , . . . , fc )) is a complete intersection closed subscheme of codimension c\ncontaining X\u03bc . We may assume in addition that D\u03bcY is a Weil divisor on X\u03bc such\nthat rD\u03bcY is Cartier and OX\u03bc (rKX\u03bc ) = OX\u03bc (\u2212rD\u03bcY )\u03c9Y\u2297r\u03bc . We take a germ g \u2208 OA\u03bc\nwhose image g is the local equation of rD\u03bcY on OX\u03bc . Let ai \u2286 OA\u03bc be the defining\nideal of Zi,\u03bc for each i = 1, . . . , m. Fix an integer e0 \u2265 1 such that pe0 \u2212 1 is divisible\nby r and set q0 = pe0 .\nClaim.

Since q \u2212 1 is divisible by r,\nOX\u03bc ((1 \u2212 q)(KX\u03bc + D\u03bcY )) = OY\u03bc (1 \u2212 q)KY\u03bc\n\n\u0001\n\n15\n\nX\u03bc\n\n= OA\u03bc ((1 \u2212 q)(KA\u03bc +\n\nc\nX\n\ndivA\u03bc (fi )))\n\nX\u03bc\n\n.\n\ni=1\n\nSet e = ne0 .

Let the notation be as in Theorem 3.2 and fix an arbitrary point x \u2208 X.\nEmploying the same strategy as the proof of [13, Theorem], we can use Theorem\n3.2 to prove that the pair (X; Z X + 1r V (JX )) is log canonical at x if and only if so\nis (A; cX + Z). This result is a special case of [14, Theorem 1.1] and [2, Theorem\n1.1], but our proof does not depend on the theory of jet schemes.\nAs a corollary, we prove the conjecture proposed in [34, Conjecture 2.8] when X\nis normal and Q-Gorenstein.\nCorollary 3.4. Let A be a smooth variety over an algebraically closed field K of\ncharacteristic\nzero and X \u2286 A be a normal Q-Gorenstein closed subvariety of A. Let\nPm\nZ = i=1 ti Zi be a formal combination where the ti are nonnegative real numbers\nand the Zi \u2286 A are proper closed subschemes which do not contain X in their\nsupport. Given any model of (A, X, Z) over a finitely generated Z-subalgebra B of\nK, there exists a dense open subset W \u2286 Spec B such that\nadjX (A, Z)\u03bc = \u03c4eX\u03bc (A\u03bc , Z\u03bc )\n\nfor every closed point \u03bc \u2208 W . In particular, the pair (A; Z) is plt along X if and\nonly if it is of purely F -regular type along X.\nProof. Let r be the Gorenstein index of X and JX \u2286 OX be the l.c.i. defect ideal\nsheaf of X. Let (AB , XB , ZB , JX,B ) be any model of (A, X, Z, JX ) over a finitely\ngenerated Z-subalgebra B of K. By [34, Theorem 2.7], there exists a dense open\nsubset W \u2286 Spec B such that\n\u03c4eX\u03bc (A\u03bc , Z\u03bc ) \u2286 adjX (A, Z)\u03bc\n\nfor all closed points \u03bc \u2208 W . Therefore, we will prove the reverse inclusion.\nAs an application of Theorem 2.3 to (\u22c6) and (\u22c6\u22c6) in the proof of Theorem 3.2,\nafter replacing W by a smaller dense open subset if necessary, we may assume that\nadjX (A, Z)\u03bc\nthat is,\n\nX\u03bc\n\n= J (X, Z\n\nX\n\n1\n+ V (JX ))\u03bc \u2286 \u03c4eX\u03bc (A\u03bc , Z\u03bc )\nr\n\nX\u03bc\n\n,\n\nadjX (A, Z)\u03bc \u2286 \u03c4eX\u03bc (A\u03bc , Z\u03bc ) + IX\u03bc\n\nfor all closed points \u03bc \u2208 W . It, however, follows from Theorem 2.3 and [3, Theorem\n5.1] that we may assume that\nadjX (A, Z)\u03bc \u2229 IX\u03bc = J (A, cX + Z)\u03bc = \u03c4e(A\u03bc , cX\u03bc + Z\u03bc )\n\u2286 \u03c4eX\u03bc (A\u03bc , Z\u03bc )\n\nfor all closed points \u03bc \u2208 W . Thus, adjX (A, Z)\u03bc \u2286 \u03c4eX\u03bc (A\u03bc , Z\u03bc ) for all closed points\n\u03bc \u2208 W.\n\u0003\n\n\fA CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN LOG CANONICITY AND F -PURITY\n\n17\n\n4. The correspondence of log canonicity and F-purity when the\ndefining equations are very general\nUsing the argument developed in the previous section and involving the l.c.i. defect\nideal sheaf, we will show that Conjecture 2.4 holds true if the defining equations of\nthe variety are very general. The following result is a generalization of a result of\nHern\u00e1ndez [8] to the singular case.\nTheorem 4.1. Let AnK = Spec K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be the affine n-space over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero and X \u2286 AnK be a normal Q-Gorenstein\nclosed subvariety of codimension c passing through the origin 0. Let r denote the\nGorenstein index of X and JX denote the l.c.i. defect ideal of X. Let a \u2286 OX\nbe a nonzero ideal and t > 0 be a real number. Suppose that there exist a system\nof generators h1 , . . . , hl for the defining ideal IX of X and a system of generators\nhl+1 , . . . , h\u03bd for a with the following property: for each i = 1, . . . , \u03bd, we can write\n\u03c1i\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(1)\n(n)\nX\n\u03b1ij\n\u03b1ij\n(1)\n(n)\nn\n\u2217\n\u03b3ij x1 * * * xn \u2208 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] (\u03b1ij , . . . , \u03b1ij ) \u2208 Z\u22650 \\ {0}, \u03b3ij \u2208 K ,\nhi =\nj=1\n\nwhere \u03b3i1 , . . . , \u03b3i\u03c1i are algebraically independent over Q. Then (X; tV (a) + 1r V (JX ))\nis log canonical at 0 if and only if it is of dense sharply F -pure type at 0.\nRemark 4.2. Note by the definition of JX that X is l.c.i. if and only if JX =\nOX . Thus, if X = Spec K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(h1 , . . . , hl ) is a normal complete intersection\nvariety, a \u2286 OX is the image of the ideal generated by hl+1 , * * * , h\u03bd , and the hi \u2208\nK[x1 , . . . , xn ] satisfy the same property as that in Theorem 4.1, then Theorem 4.1\nsays that (X, tV (a)) is log canonical at 0 if and only if it is of dense sharply F -pure\ntype.\nProof. By Remark 2.5, it suffices to show that if (X; tV (a)+ 1r V (JX )) is log canonical\nat 0, then it is of dense sharply F-pure type.\nSuppose that (X; tV (a) + 1r V (JX )) is log canonical at 0. Since the log canonical\nthreshold lct0 ((X; 1r V (JX )); V (a)) is a rational number, we may assume that t is a\nrational number. Take a sufficiently general complete intersection closed subscheme\nY = V ((f1 , . . . , fc )) of codimension c containing X, and let s = c \u2212 l + \u03bd and\nfc+j = hl+j for every j = 1, . . . , s \u2212 c. For each i = 1, . . . , s, we can write\nmi\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(1)\n(n)\nX\naij\naij\n(1)\n(n)\nn\n\u2217\nfi =\nuij x1 * * * xn \u2208 K[x1 , . . . , xn ]\n(aij , . . . , aij ) \u2208 Z\u22650 \\ {0}, uij \u2208 K ,\nj=1\n\nwhere u11 , . . . , u1m1 , . . . , us1, . . . , usms are algebraically independent over Q. We decompose Y into the scheme-theoretic union of X and a variety C Y , and denote by\nD Y the Weil divisor on X obtained by restricting C Y to X. Let g \u2208 K[x1 , . . . , xn ]\nbe a polynomial whose image is a local equation of the Cartier divisor rD Y in a\nneighborhood of 0. Using the standard decent theory of [10, Chapter 2], we can\nchoose a model\nY\n(AnB = Spec B[x1 , . . . , xn ], XB , YB = V ((f1,B , . . . , fc,B )), DB\n, aB , JX,B , gB )\n\nof (AnK , X, Y, D Y , a, JX , g) over a finitely generated Z-subalgebra B of K such that\n\n\f18\n\nSHUNSUKE TAKAGI\n\nQ\n(i) Z[u11 , . . . , u1m1 , . . . , us1, . . . , usms , 1/( i,j uij )] \u2286 B,\n(ii) the image of gB lies in JB ,\n(iii) X\u03bc is a normal Q-Gorenstein closed subvariety of codimension c passing the\norigin 0 with Gorenstein index r,\n(iv) Y\u03bc is a complete intersection closed subscheme of codimension c containing\nX\u03bc ,\n(v) rD\u03bcY is a Cartier divisor on X\u03bc and OX\u03bc (rKX\u03bc ) = OX\u03bc (\u2212rD\u03bcY )\u03c9Y\u2297r\u03bc ,\n(vi) the image of g\u03bc is a local equation of rD\u03bcY at 0\nfor all closed points \u03bc \u2208 Spec B. It is then enough to show that there exists\n\u0001 a dense\n1\nsubset of closed points W \u2286 Spec B such that X\u03bc ; tV (a\u03bc ) + r V (JX,\u03bc ) is sharply\nF -pure at 0 for all \u03bc \u2208 W .\nSince (X; tV (a) + 1r V (JX )) is log canonical at 0, it follows from [14, Theorem 1.1]\nand [2, Theorem 1.1] (see also Remark 3.3) that (AnK ; tV (a) + cX) is log canonical\nat 0. By a general choice of f1 , . . . , fc , it is equivalent to saying that\n(AnK ;\n\nc\nX\n\ndiv(fi ) + tV (fc+1 , . . . , fs ))\n\ni=1\n\nis log canonical at 0. By making use of the summation formula for multiplier\nideals [32, Theorem 3.2], for any \u01eb > 0, there exist nonnegative rational numbers\n\u03bbc+1 (\u01eb), . . . , \u03bbs (\u01eb) with \u03bbc+1 (\u01eb) + * * * + \u03bbs (\u01eb) = t(1 \u2212 \u01eb) such that\n(AnK ,\n\nc\nX\n\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)div(fi ) +\n\ni=1\n\ns\nX\n\n\u03bbj (\u01eb)div(fj ))\n\nj=c+1\n\nis klt at 0. Let afi be the term ideal of fi (that is, the monomial ideal generated\nby the P\nterms of fi ) for each\nPi = 1, . . . , s. Since afi contains fi , the monomial ideal\nJ (AnK , ci=1 (1\u2212\u01eb)V (afi )+ sj=c+1 \u03bbj (\u01eb)V (afj )) is trivial.

Since si=c+1 m\nj=1 \u03c3ij = t and the image of g\u03bc lies\u0001 in\nJX,\u03bc , it follows from Lemma 1.5 (2) again that the pair X\u03bc ; 1r V (JX,\u03bc ) + tV (a\u03bc ) is\nsharply F -pure at 0.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.3. Using the same arguments as the proof of Theorem 4.1, we can prove the\nfollowing: let X = Spec K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fc ) be a normal complete intersection\nover a field K of characteristic zero passing through the origin 0.

In addition, we assume\nthat X is log canonical at 0. Then the following hold:\nP i\nP\n(1) lct0 (X, Z) is equal to the optimal value si=c+1 m\nj=1 \u03c3ij .\n(2) Given any model of (X, Z) over a finitely generated Z-subalgebra B of K,\nthere exists a dense subset of closed points W \u2286 Spec B such that\nlct0 (X; Z) = fpt0 (X\u03bc ; Z\u03bc )\nfor all \u03bc \u2208 W .\nIn [28], Shibuta and the author showed that the assumption of Remark 4.3 is\nsatisfied if X = AnK and Z is a complete intersection binomial subscheme or a space\nmonomial curve (in the latter case, n = 3). However, in general, there exists a\nbinomial subscheme that does not satisfy the assumption.\nExample 4.4. Let X = A6K = Spec K[x1 , x2 , x3 , y1, y2 , y3 ] be the affine 6-space over\na field K of characteristic zero and Z \u2286 X be the closed subscheme defined by the\nbinomials x1 y2 \u2212 x2 y1 , x2 y3 \u2212 x3 y2 and x1 y3 \u2212 x3 y1 . Then Z does not satisfy the\nassumption of Remark 4.3. Indeed, lct0 (X, Z) = 2 but the optimal value of the\nlinear programming problem in Remark 4.3 is equal to 3. Given a prime number p,\n\n\f22\n\nSHUNSUKE TAKAGI\n\nlet Xp = A6Fp = Spec Fp [x1 , x2 , x3 , y1, y2 , y3 ] and Zp \u2286 Xp be the reduction modulo p\nof Z. Since fpt0 (Xp , Zp ) = 2 for all primes p, Conjecture 2.4 holds for this example.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. Blickle, Multiplier ideals and modules on toric varieties, Math.
