INTRODUCTION\n\nIn this Chapter, the probability distribution of money\nin a system of economic agents is studied using\nmethods of statistical physics. This study originates\nfrom the interdisciplinary field known as econophysics\n(Stanley et al., 1996), which applies mathematical methods of statistical physics to social, economical, and financial problems (Stauffer, 2004).\nOne of the most puzzling social problems is the persistent wide range of economic inequality among the population in any society. In statistical physics, it is very\nwell known that identical (\"equal\") molecules in a gas\nspontaneously develop a widely unequal distribution of\nenergies as a result of random energy transfers in collisions between the molecules. Using similar principles,\nthis Chapter shows how a very unequal probability distribution of money among economic agents develops spontaneously as a result of money transfers between them.\nThe literature on social and economic inequality\nis enormous (Kakwani, 1980). Many papers in the\neconomic literature (Champernowne, 1953; Gibrat,\n1931; Kalecki, 1945) use a stochastic process to describe dynamics of individual wealth or income and\nto derive their probability distributions. One might\ncall this a one-body approach, because wealth and\nincome fluctuations are considered independently for\neach economic agent. Inspired by Boltzmann's kinetic\ntheory of collisions in gases, we introduce an alternative,\ntwo-body approach, where agents perform pairwise\neconomic transactions and transfer money from one\nagent to another. We start with a simple pairwisetransfer model proposed by Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko\n(2000). This model is the most closely related to the\ntraditional statistical mechanics, which we briefly review\nfirst. Then we discuss other money-transfer models\nand further developments. For a more detailed and\nsystematic review of the progress in this field, see\nthe recent review by Yakovenko and Rosser (2009), as\nwell as reviews by Chatterjee and Chakrabarti (2007);\nRichmond, Hutzler, Coelho, and Repetowicz\n(2006);\n\nRichmond, Repetowicz, Hutzler, and Coelho (2006) and\na popular article by Hayes (2002).\nInterestingly, the study of pairwise money transfer and\nthe resulting statistical distribution of money have virtually no counterpart in the modern economic literature.\nOnly the search theory of money (Kiyotaki and Wright,\n1993) is somewhat related to it. However, a probability distribution of money among the agents within the\nsearch-theoretical approach was only recently obtained\nnumerically by the economist Miguel Molico (2006).\nII. THE BOLTZMANN-GIBBS DISTRIBUTION OF\nENERGY\n\nThe fundamental law of equilibrium statistical mechanics is the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. It states\nthat the probability P (\u03b5) of finding a physical system or\nsubsystem in a state with the energy \u03b5 is given by the\nexponential function\nP (\u03b5) = c e\u2212\u03b5/T ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere T is the temperature, and c is a normalizing constant (Wannier, 1987). Here we set the Boltzmann constant kB to unity by choosing the energy units for measuring the physical temperature T . Then, the expectation value of any physical variable x can be obtained as\nP\n\u2212\u03b5k /T\nk xk e\nhxi = P\n,\n(2)\n\u2212\u03b5k /T\nke\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all states of the system.\nTemperature is equal to the average energy per particle:\nT \u223c h\u03b5i, up to a numerical coefficient of the order of 1.\nEq. (1) can be derived in different ways (Wannier,\n1987). All derivations involve the two main ingredients:\nstatistical character of the system and conservation of\nenergy \u03b5. One of the shortest derivations can be summarized as follows. Let us divide the system into two\n(generally unequal) parts. Then, the total energy is the\nsum of the parts: \u03b5 = \u03b51 + \u03b52 , whereas the probability\nis the product of probabilities: P (\u03b5) = P (\u03b51 ) P (\u03b52 ). The\n\n\f2\nonly solution of these two equations is the exponential\nfunction (1).\nA more sophisticated derivation, proposed by Boltzmann, uses the concept of entropy. Let us consider N\nparticles with the total energy E. Let us divide the energy axis into small intervals (bins) of width \u2206\u03b5 and\ncount the number of particles Nk having the energies\nfrom \u03b5k to \u03b5k + \u2206\u03b5. The ratio Nk /N = Pk gives the\nprobability for a particle to have the energy \u03b5k . Let us\nnow calculate the multiplicity W , which is the number\nof permutations of the particles between different energy\nbins such that the occupation numbers of the bins do\nnot change. This quantity is given by the combinatorial\nformula in terms of the factorials\nW =\n\nN!\n.\nN1 ! N2 ! N3 ! . . .\n\n(3)\n\nThe logarithm of multiplicity is called the entropy S =\nln W . In the limit of large numbers, the entropy per\nparticle can be written in the following form using the\nStirling approximation for the factorials\nX\nX Nk \u0012 Nk \u0013\nS\n=\u2212\nPk ln Pk .\n(4)\n=\u2212\nln\nN\nN\nN\nk\n\nk\n\nNow we would like to find what distribution of particles\namong different energy states has the highest entropy,\ni.e., the highest multiplicity,\nprovided the total energy of\nP\nthe system, E = k Nk \u03b5k , has a fixed value. Solution of\nthis problem can be easily obtained using the method of\nLagrange multipliers (Wannier, 1987), and the answer is\ngiven by the exponential distribution (1).\nThe same result can be also derived from the ergodic theory, which says that the many-body system occupies all possible states of a given total energy with\nequal probabilities. Then it is straightforward to show\n(L\u00f3pez-Ruiz et al., 2008) that the probability distribution of the energy of an individual particle is given by\nEq. (1).\nIII. CONSERVATION OF MONEY\n\nThe derivations outlined in Sec. II are very general and\nonly use the statistical character of the system and the\nconservation of energy. So, one may expect that the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution (1) would apply\nto other statistical systems with a conserved quantity.\nThe economy is a big statistical system with millions\nof participating agents, so it is a promising target for applications of statistical mechanics. Is there a conserved\nquantity in the economy? Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko\n(2000) argued that such a conserved quantity is money\nm. Indeed, the ordinary economic agents can only receive money from and give money to other agents. They\nare not permitted to \"manufacture\" money, e.g., to print\ndollar bills. Let us consider an economic transaction between agents i and j. When the agent i pays money\n\n\u2206m to the agent j for some goods or services, the money\nbalances of the agents change as follows\nmi \u2192 m\u2032i = mi \u2212 \u2206m,\nmj \u2192 m\u2032j = mj + \u2206m.\n\n(5)\n\nThe total amount of money of the two agents before and\nafter transaction remains the same\nmi + mj = m\u2032i + m\u2032j ,\n\n(6)\n\ni.e., there is a local conservation law for money. The rule\n(5) for the transfer of money is analogous to the transfer of energy from one molecule to another in molecular\ncollisions in a gas, and Eq. (6) is analogous to conservation of energy in such collisions. Conservative models\nof this kind are also studied in some economic literature\n(Kiyotaki and Wright, 1993; Molico, 2006).\nWe should emphasize that, in the model of\nDr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000) [as in the economic\nmodels of Kiyotaki and Wright (1993); Molico (2006)],\nthe transfer of money from one agent to another represents payment for goods and services in a market economy. However, the model of Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko\n(2000) only keeps track of money flow, but does not keep\ntrack of what goods and service are delivered. One reason\nfor this is that many goods, e.g., food and other supplies,\nand most services, e.g., getting a haircut or going to a\nmovie, are not tangible and disappear after consumption. Because they are not conserved, and also because\nthey are measured in different physical units, it is not\nvery practical to keep track of them. In contrast, money\nis measured in the same unit (within a given country\nwith a single currency) and is conserved in local transactions (6), so it is straightforward to keep track of money\nflow. It is also important to realize that an increase in\nmaterial production does not produce an automatic increase in money supply. The agents can grow apples on\ntrees, but cannot grow money on trees. Only a central\nbank has the monopoly of changing the monetary base\nMb (McConnell and Brue, 1996). (Debt and credit issues\nare discussed separately in Sec. VI.)\nEnforcement of the local conservation law (6) is the key\nfeature for successful functioning of money. If the agents\nwere permitted to \"manufacture\" money, they would be\nprinting money and buying all goods for nothing, which\nwould be a disaster. The purpose of the conservation\nlaw is to ensure that an agent can buy goods and products from the society (the other agents) only if he or she\ncontributes something useful to the society and receives\nmoney payment for these contributions. Thus, money\nis an accounting device, and, indeed, all accounting systems are based on the conservation law (5). The physical\nmedium of money is not essential as long as the local conservation law is enforced. The days of gold standard are\nlong gone, so money today is truly the fiat money, declared to be money by the central bank. Money may be\nin the form of paper currency, but today it is more often represented by digits on computerized accounts. So,\n\n\f3\n5\n\n5\n\nN=500, M=5*10 , time=4*10 .\n\n18\n16\n\n\u3008m\u3009, T\n\n14\n3\n12\nlog P(m)\n\nProbability, P(m)\n\nmoney is nothing but bits of information, and monetary\nsystem represents an informational layer of the economy.\nMonetary system interacts with physical system (production and consumption of material goods), but the two\nlayers cannot be transformed into each other because of\ntheir different nature.\nUnlike, ordinary economic agents, a central bank or a\ncentral government can inject money into the economy,\nthus changing the total amount of money in the system.\nThis process is analogous to an influx of energy into a system from external sources, e.g., the Earth receives energy\nfrom the Sun. Dealing with these situations, physicists\nstart with an idealization of a closed system in thermal\nequilibrium and then generalize to an open system subject to an energy flux. As long as the rate of money\ninflux from central sources is slow compared with relaxation processes in the economy and does not cause hyperinflation, the system is in quasi-stationary statistical\nequilibrium with slowly changing parameters. This situation is analogous to heating a kettle on a gas stove\nslowly, where the kettle has a well-defined, but slowly increasing, temperature at any moment of time. A flux of\nmoney may be also produced by international transfers\nacross the boundaries of a country. This process involves\ncomplicated issues of multiple currencies in the world and\ntheir exchange rates (McCauley, 2008). Here we consider\nan idealization of a closed economy for a single country\nwith a single currency.\nAnother potential problem with conservation of money\nis debt. This issue will be discussed in Sec. VI. As a\nstarting point, Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000) considered simple models, where debt is not permitted, which\nis also a common idealization in some economic literature (Kiyotaki and Wright, 1993; Molico, 2006). This\nmeans that money balances of the agents cannot go below zero: mi \u2265 0 for all i. Transaction (5) takes place\nonly when an agent has enough money to pay the price:\nmi \u2265 \u2206m, otherwise the transaction does not take place.\nIf an agent spends all money, the balance drops to zero\nmi = 0, so the agent cannot buy any goods from other\nagents. However, this agent can still receive money from\nother agents for delivering goods or services to them. In\nreal life, money balance dropping to zero is not at all\nunusual for people who live from paycheck to paycheck.\nMacroeconomic monetary policy issues, such as money\nsupply and money demand (Friedman and Hahn, 1990),\nare outside of the scope of this Chapter. Our goal is to\ninvestigate the probability distribution of money among\neconomic agents. For this purpose, it is appropriate\nto make the simplifying macroeconomic idealizations, as\ndescribed above, in order to ensure overall stability of\nthe system and existence of statistical equilibrium. The\nconcept of \"equilibrium\" is a very common idealization\nin economic literature, even though the real economies\nmight never be in equilibrium. Here we extend this concept to a statistical equilibrium, which is characterized by\na stationary probability distribution of money P (m), in\ncontrast to a mechanical equilibrium, where the \"forces\"\n\n10\n8\n\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n6\n\n1000\n2000\nMoney, m\n\n3000\n\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\nMoney, m\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\nFIG. 1 Histogram and points: Stationary probability distribution of money P (m) obtained in additive random-exchange\nmodels.

THE BOLTZMANN-GIBBS DISTRIBUTION OF\nMONEY\n\nHaving recognized the principle of local money conservation, Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000) argued that\nthe stationary distribution of money P (m) should be\ngiven by the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs function analogous to Eq. (1)\nP (m) = c e\u2212m/Tm .\n\n(7)\n\nHere c is a normalizing constant, and Tm is the \"money\ntemperature\", which is equal to the average amount of\nmoney per agent: T = hmi = M/N , where M is the total\nmoney, and N is the number of agents.1\nTo verify this conjecture, Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko\n(2000) performed agent-based computer simulations of\nmoney transfers between agents. Initially all agents were\ngiven the same amount of money, say, $1000. Then, a\npair of agents (i, j) was randomly selected, the amount\n\u2206m was transferred from one agent to another, and the\nprocess was repeated many times. Time evolution of\nthe probability distribution of money P (m) is illustrated\nin computer animation videos by Chen and Yakovenko\n(2007) and by Wright (2007). After a transitory period, money distribution converges to the stationary form\nshown in Fig. 1. As expected, the distribution is well fitted by the exponential function (7).\n\n1\n\nBecause debt is not permitted in this model, we have M = Mb ,\nwhere Mb is the monetary base (McConnell and Brue, 1996).\n\n\f4\n\n\"There is a great temptation to consider the\nexchanges of money which occur in economic\ninteraction as analogous to the exchanges of\nenergy which occur in physical shocks between gas molecules.\"\nHe realized that this process should result in the exponential distribution, by analogy with the barometric distribution of density in the atmosphere. However, he discarded this idea, because it does not produce the Pareto\n\n5\n\nN=500, M=5*10 , \u03b1=1/3.\n16\n14\n12\nProbability, P(m)\n\nSeveral different rules for \u2206m were considered by\nDr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000). In one model, the\ntransferred amount was fixed to a constant \u2206m = $1.\nEconomically, it means that all agents were selling their\nproducts for the same price \u2206m = $1. Computer animation (Chen and Yakovenko, 2007) shows that the initial distribution of money first broadens to a symmetric Gaussian curve, characteristic for a diffusion process. Then, the distribution starts to pile up around\nthe m = 0 state, which acts as the impenetrable boundary, because of the imposed condition m \u2265 0. As a result, P (m) becomes skewed (asymmetric) and eventually reaches the stationary exponential shape, as shown\nin Fig. 1. The boundary at m = 0 is analogous to\nthe ground-state energy in statistical physics. Without\nthis boundary condition, the probability distribution of\nmoney would not reach a stationary state. Computer\nanimations (Chen and Yakovenko, 2007; Wright, 2007)\nalso show howPthe entropy of money distribution, defined\nas S/N = \u2212 k P (mk ) ln P (mk ), grows from the initial\nvalue S = 0, where all agents have the same money, to\nthe maximal value at the statistical equilibrium.\nWhile the model with \u2206m = 1 is very simple and\ninstructive, it is not realistic, because all prices are\ntaken to be the same. In another model considered by\nDr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000), \u2206m in each transaction is taken to be a random fraction of the average amount of money per agent, i.e., \u2206m = \u03bd(M/N ),\nwhere \u03bd is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1. The random distribution of \u2206m is supposed to represent the wide variety of prices for different products in the real economy. Computer simulation\nof this model produces the same stationary distribution\n(7). Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000) also considered a\nmodel with firms, which hire agents to produce and sell\nproducts. This process results in a many-body transfer of money, as opposed to pairwise transfer discussed\nabove. Computer simulation of this model also generates\nthe same exponential distribution (7).\nThese ideas were further developed by Garibaldi et al.\n(2007); Scalas et al. (2006). The Boltzmann distribution\nwas independently applied to social sciences by the physicist J\u00fcrgen Mimkes (2000); Mimkes and Willis (2005) using the Lagrange principle of maximization with constraints. The exponential distribution of money was also\nfound by the economist Martin Shubik (1999) using a\nMarkov chain approach to strategic market games. A\nlong time ago, Benoit Mandelbrot (1960, p 83) observed:\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n3000\nMoney, m\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\nFIG. 2 Histogram: Stationary probability distribution of\nmoney in the multiplicative random-exchange model (8) for\n\u03b3 = 1/3.

Ironically, the actual economic\ndata (Yakovenko and Rosser, 2009) do show the exponential distribution for the majority of the population.\nMoreover, the data have a finite variance, so the stable\nL\u00e9vy distributions are not applicable because of their infinite variance.\n\nV. PROPORTIONAL MONEY TRANSFERS AND\nSAVING PROPENSITY\n\nIn the models of money transfer discussed in Sec.\nIV, the transferred amount \u2206m is typically independent of the money balances of the agents involved. A\ndifferent model was introduced earlier by the physicists\nIspolatov, Krapivsky, and Redner (1998) and called the\nmultiplicative asset exchange model. This model also satisfies the conservation law, but the transferred amount of\nmoney is a fixed fraction \u03b3 of the payer's money in Eq.\n(5):\n\u2206m = \u03b3mi .\n\n(8)\n\nThe stationary distribution of money in this model, compared in Fig. 2 with an exponential function, is similar,\nalbeit not exactly equal, to the Gamma distribution:\nP (m) = c m\u03b2 e\u2212m/T .\n\n(9)\n\nEq. (9) differs from Eq. (7) by the power-law prefactor\nm\u03b2 . For \u03b2 > 0, the population with low money balances\nis reduced, and P (0) = 0, as shown in Fig. 2.\nEssentially the same model (Lux, 2005), called the inequality process, has been introduced and studied much\nearlier by the sociologist John Angle (1986, 1992, 1993,\n\n\f5\n1996, 2002, 2006). Angle (1986) associated the proportionality rule (8) with the surplus theory of social stratification (Engels, 1972), which argues that inequality in\nhuman society develops when people can produce more\nthan necessary for minimal subsistence. This additional\nwealth (surplus) can be transferred from original producers to other people, thus generating inequality. Angle\nfound a Gamma-like distribution (9) in numerical simulations of his models. Independently, the economist Miguel\nMolico (2006) studied conservative exchange models (5)\nwhere agents bargain over prices in their transactions.\nHe also found a stationary Gamma-like distribution of\nmoney in numerical simulations.\nAnother model with an element of proportionality was\nproposed by Chakraborti and Chakrabarti (2000). In\nthis model, the agents set aside (save) some fraction of\ntheir money \u03bbmi , whereas the rest of their money balance (1 \u2212 \u03bb)mi becomes available for random exchanges.\nThus, the rule of exchange (5) becomes\nm\u2032i = \u03bbmi + \u03be(1 \u2212 \u03bb)(mi + mj ),\nm\u2032j = \u03bbmj + (1 \u2212 \u03be)(1 \u2212 \u03bb)(mi + mj ).\n\n(10)\n\nHere the coefficient \u03bb is called the saving propensity, and the random variable \u03be is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Computer simulations by\nChakraborti and Chakrabarti (2000) of the model (10)\nfound a stationary distribution close to the Gamma distribution (9). With \u03bb 6= 0, agents always keep some\nmoney, so their balances never drop to zero, thus P (0) =\n0.\nIn the subsequent papers by the Kolkata school and\nrelated papers, the case of random saving propensity was\nstudied. In these models, the agents are assigned random\nparameters \u03bb drawn from a uniform distribution between\n0 and 1 (Chatterjee, Chakrabarti, and Manna, 2004).\nIt was found that this model produces a power-law tail\nP (m) \u221d 1/m2 at high m. The reasons for stability of\nthis law were understood using the Boltzmann kinetic\nequation\n(Chatterjee, Chakrabarti, and Stinchcombe,\n2005;\nDas and Yarlagadda,\n2005;\nRepetowicz, Hutzler, and Richmond,\n2005),\nbut most elegantly in the mean-field theory\n(Bhattacharyya, Chatterjee, and Chakrabarti,\n2007;\nChatterjee and Chakrabarti, 2007; Mohanty, 2006).\nThe fat tail originates from the agents whose saving\npropensity is close to 1, who hoard money and do not\ngive it back (Patriarca, Chakraborti, and Germano,\n2006; Patriarca et al., 2005).\nA more rigorous mathematical treatment of the problem was\ngiven\nby\nD\u00fcring, Matthes, and Toscani\n(2008);\nD\u00fcring and Toscani\n(2007);\nMatthes and Toscani\n(2008).\nAs a further extension, Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko\n(2000) considered a model with taxation, which also has\nan element of proportionality. The Gamma distribution\nwas also studied for conservative models within a simple\nBoltzmann approach by Ferrero (2004, 2005) and, using\n\nmore complicated rules of exchange motivated by political economy, by Scafetta, Picozzi, and West (2004a,b).\nAnother extension of these studies includes not only\nmoney transfers, but also transfers of a commodity, for which money is paid (Ausloos and Pekalski,\n2007;\nChakraborti, Pradhan, and Chakrabarti,\n2001; Chatterjee and Chakrabarti, 2006; Lux, 2009;\nSilver, Slud, and Takamoto, 2002). For a more detailed\nreview of these models, see Yakovenko and Rosser\n(2009).\nThe stationary distribution of money (9) is different\nfrom the simple exponential formula (7). The origin of\nthis difference can be understood from the Boltzmann\nkinetic equation (Lifshitz and Pitaevskii, 1981; Wannier,\n1987). This equation describes time evolution of the distribution function P (m) due to pairwise interactions:\nZZ\ndP (m)\n=\n{\u2212f[m,m\u2032 ]\u2192[m\u2212\u2206,m\u2032 +\u2206] P (m)P (m\u2032 ) (11)\ndt\n+f[m\u2212\u2206,m\u2032+\u2206]\u2192[m,m\u2032 ] P (m \u2212 \u2206)P (m\u2032 + \u2206)} dm\u2032 d\u2206.\nHere f[m,m\u2032 ]\u2192[m\u2212\u2206,m\u2032 +\u2206] is the probability of transferring money \u2206 from an agent with money m to an agent\nwith money m\u2032 per unit time. This probability, multiplied by the occupation numbers P (m) and P (m\u2032 ), gives\nthe rate of transitions from the state [m, m\u2032 ] to the state\n[m \u2212 \u2206, m\u2032 + \u2206]. The first term in Eq. (11) gives the depopulation rate of the state m. The second term in Eq.\n(11) describes the reversed process, where the occupation\nnumber P (m) increases. When the two terms are equal,\nthe direct and reversed transitions cancel each other statistically, and the probability distribution is stationary:\ndP (m)/dt = 0. This is the principle of detailed balance.\nIn physics, the fundamental microscopic equations of\nmotion obey the time-reversal symmetry. This means\nthat the probabilities of the direct and reversed processes\nare exactly equal:\nf[m,m\u2032 ]\u2192[m\u2212\u2206,m\u2032 +\u2206] = f[m\u2212\u2206,m\u2032 +\u2206]\u2192[m,m\u2032 ] .\n\n(12)\n\nWhen Eq. (12) is satisfied, the detailed balance condition for Eq. (11) reduces to the equation P (m)P (m\u2032 ) =\nP (m \u2212 \u2206)P (m\u2032 + \u2206), because the factors f cancels out.\nThe only solution of this equation is the exponential function P (m) = c exp(\u2212m/Tm ), so the Boltzmann-Gibbs\ndistribution is the stationary solution of the Boltzmann\nkinetic equation (11). Notice that the transition probabilities (12) are determined by the dynamical rules of\nthe model, but the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution does not depend on the dynamical rules at all.\nThis is the origin of the universality of the BoltzmannGibbs distribution. We see that it is possible to find the\nstationary distribution without knowing details of the dynamical rules (which are rarely known very well), as long\nas the symmetry condition (12) is satisfied.\nThe models considered in Sec. IV have the timereversal symmetry. The model with the fixed money\ntransfer \u2206 has equal probabilities (12) of transferring\nmoney from an agent with the balance m to an agent\n\n\f6\nwith the balance m\u2032 and vice versa. This is also true\nwhen \u2206 is random, as long as the probability distribution\nof \u2206 is independent of m and m\u2032 . Thus, the stationary\ndistribution P (m) is always exponential in these models.\nOn the other hand, in the model (8), the time-reversal\nsymmetry is broken. Indeed, when an agent i gives a\nfixed fraction \u03b3 of his money mi to an agent with balance mj , their balances become (1 \u2212 \u03b3)mi and mj + \u03b3mi .\nIf we try to reverse this process and appoint the agent j\nto be the payer and to give the fraction \u03b3 of her money,\n\u03b3(mj + \u03b3mi ), to the agent i, the system does not return\nto the original configuration [mi , mj ]. As emphasized by\nAngle (2006), the payer pays a deterministic fraction of\nhis money, but the receiver receives a random amount\nfrom a random agent, so their roles are not interchangeable. Because the proportional rule typically violates\nthe time-reversal symmetry, the stationary distribution\nP (m) in multiplicative models is not exponential.\nThese examples show that the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution does not necessarily hold for any conservative model. However, it is universal in a limited sense\nfor a broad class of models that have time-reversal\nsymmetry. In the absence of detailed knowledge of\nreal microscopic dynamics of economic exchanges, the\nsemiuniversal Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution (7) is a\nnatural starting point. Moreover, the assumption of\nDr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000) that agents pay the\nsame prices \u2206m for the same products, independent of\ntheir money balances m, seems very appropriate for the\nmodern anonymous economy, especially for purchases\nover the Internet. There is no particular empirical evidence for the proportional rules (8) or (10). By further\nmodifying the rules of money transfer and introducing\nmore parameters in the models, it is possible to obtain\neven more complicated distributions (Scafetta and West,\n2007). However, parsimony is the virtue of a good mathematical model, not the abundance of additional assumptions and parameters, whose correspondence to reality is\nhard to verify.\n\nVI. MODELS WITH DEBT\n\nNow let us discuss how the results change when debt is\npermitted.2 From the standpoint of individual economic\nagents, debt may be considered as negative money. When\nan agent borrows money from a bank (considered here as\na big reservoir of money),3 the cash balance of the agent\n\n2\n\n3\n\nThe ideas presented here are quite similar to those by Soddy\n(1933). Frederick Soddy, the Nobel Prize winner in chemistry\nfor his work on radioactivity, argued that the real wealth is derived from the energy use in transforming raw materials into\ngoods and services, and not from monetary transactions. He\nalso warned about dangers of excessive debt and related \"virtual\nwealth\" resulting in the Great Depression.\nHere we treat the bank as being outside of the system consisting\nof ordinary agents, because we are interested in money distri-\n\n(positive money) increases, but the agent also acquires\na debt obligation (negative money), so the total balance\n(net worth) of the agent remains the same. Thus, the act\nof borrowing money still satisfies a generalized conservation law of the total money (net worth), which is now\ndefined as the algebraic sum of positive (cash M ) and\nnegative (debt D) contributions: M \u2212D = Mb , where Mb\nis the original amount of money in the system, the monetary base (McConnell and Brue, 1996). After spending\nsome cash in pairwise transactions (5), the agent still has\nthe debt obligation (negative money), so the total money\nbalance mi of the agent (net worth) becomes negative.\nWe see that the boundary condition mi \u2265 0, discussed in\nSec. III, does not apply when debt is permitted, so m = 0\nis not the ground state any more. The consequence of\npermitting debt is not a violation of the conservation law\n(which is still preserved in the generalized form for net\nworth), but a modification of the boundary condition by\npermitting agents to have negative balances mi < 0 of net\nworth. A more detailed discussion of positive and negative money and the book-keeping accounting from the\neconophysics point of view was presented by the physicist\nDieter Braun (2001) and Fischer and Braun (2003a,b).\nNow we can repeat the simulation described in Sec.\nIV without the boundary condition m \u2265 0 by allowing\nagents to go into debt. When an agent needs to buy a\nproduct at a price \u2206m exceeding his money balance mi ,\nthe agent is now permitted to borrow the difference from\na bank and, thus, to buy the product. As a result of\nthis transaction, the new balance of the agent becomes\nnegative: m\u2032i = mi \u2212 \u2206m < 0. Notice that the local conservation law (5) and (6) is still satisfied, but it involves\nnegative values of m. If the simulation is continued further without any restrictions on the debt of the agents,\nthe probability distribution of money P (m) never stabilizes, and the system never reaches a stationary state. As\ntime goes on, P (m) keeps spreading in a Gaussian manner unlimitedly toward m = +\u221e and m = \u2212\u221e. Because\nof the generalized conservation law discussed above, the\nfirst moment hmi = Mb /N of the algebraically defined\nmoney m remains constant. It means that some agents\nbecome richer with positive balances m > 0 at the expense of other agents going further into debt with negative balances m < 0, so that M = Mb + D.\nCommon sense, as well as the experience with the current financial crisis, tells us that an economic system cannot be stable if unlimited debt is permitted.4 In this case,\nagents can buy any goods without producing anything in\nexchange by simply going into unlimited debt. Arguably,\nthe current financial crisis was caused by the enormous\n\n4\n\nbution among these agents. The debt of agents is an asset for\nthe bank, and deposits of cash into the bank are liabilities of\nthe bank (McConnell and Brue, 1996). We do not go into these\ndetails in order to keep our presentation simple.\nIn qualitative agreement with the conclusions by McCauley\n(2008).\n\n\f7\n5\n\n5\n\nN=500, M=5*10 , time=4*10 .\n\n18\n16\n\nModel with debt, T=1800\n\n12\n10\n\nModel without debt, T=1000\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n-3\n\nlog(P(m)) (1x10\n\nProbability, P(m)\n\n14\n\n)\n\n-3\n\nProbability,P(m) (1x10 )\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n-50\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nMonetary Wealth,m\n\n0\n\n2\n-50\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\nMoney, m\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\nFIG. 3 Histograms: Stationary distributions of money with\nand without debt.

From\nDr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000).\n\ndebt accumulation in the system, triggered by subprime\nmortgages and financial derivatives based on them. A\nwidely expressed opinion is that the current crisis is not\nthe problem of liquidity, i.e., a temporary difficulty in\ncash flow, but the problem of insolvency, i.e., the inherent inability of many participants to pay back their debts.\nDetailed discussion of the current economic situation\nis not a subject of this paper. Going back to the idealized\nmodel of money transfers, one would need to impose some\nsort of modified boundary conditions in order to prevent\nunlimited growth of debt and to ensure overall stability\nof the system. Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000) considered a simple model where the maximal debt of each\nagent is limited to a certain amount md . This means\nthat the boundary condition mi \u2265 0 is now replaced by\nthe condition mi \u2265 \u2212md for all agents i. Setting interest rates on borrowed money to be zero for simplicity,\nDr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000) performed computer\nsimulations of the models described in Sec. IV with the\nnew boundary condition. The results are shown in Fig.\n3. Not surprisingly, the stationary money distribution\nagain has the exponential shape, but now with the new\nboundary condition at m = \u2212md and the higher money\ntemperature Td = md + Mb /N . By allowing agents to go\ninto debt up to md , we effectively increase the amount of\nmoney available to each agent by md . So, the money temperature, which is equal to the average amount of effectively available money per agent, increases correspondingly.\nXi, Ding, and Wang (2005) considered another, more\nrealistic boundary condition, where a constraint is imposed not on the individual debt of each agent, but\non the total debt of all agents in the system. This is\naccomplished via the required reserve ratio R, which\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nMonetary Wealth,m\n\nFIG. 4 The stationary distribution of money for the required\nreserve ratio R = 0.8. The distribution is exponential for both\npositive and negative money with different \"temperatures\" T+\nand T\u2212 , as illustrated by the inset on log-linear scale. From\nXi, Ding, and Wang (2005).\n\nis briefly explained below (McConnell and Brue, 1996).\nBanks are required by law to set aside a fraction R of\nthe money deposited into bank accounts, whereas the\nremaining fraction 1 \u2212 R can be loaned further. If the\ninitial amount of money in the system (the money base)\nis Mb , then, with repeated loans and borrowing, the total amount of positive money available to the agents increases to M = Mb /R, where the factor 1/R is called\nthe money multiplier (McConnell and Brue, 1996). This\nis how \"banks create money\". Where does this extra\nmoney come from? It comes from the increase in the total debt in the system. The maximal total debt is given\nby D = Mb /R\u2212Mb and is limited by the factor R. When\nthe debt is maximal, the total amounts of positive, Mb /R,\nand negative, Mb (1 \u2212 R)/R, money circulate among the\nagents in the system, so there are two constraints in the\nmodel considered by Xi, Ding, and Wang (2005). Thus,\nwe expect to see the exponential distributions of positive\nand negative money characterized by two different temperatures: T+ = Mb /RN and T\u2212 = Mb (1 \u2212 R)/RN .\nThis is exactly what was found in computer simulations by Xi, Ding, and Wang (2005), as shown in Fig.\n4. Similar two-sided distributions were also found by\nFischer and Braun (2003a).\nHowever, in the real economy, the reserve requirement\nis not effective in stabilizing total debt in the system, because it applies only to deposits from general public, but\nnot from corporations. Moreover, there are alternative\ninstruments of debt, including derivatives and various unregulated \"financial innovations\". As a result, the total\ndebt is not limited in practice and can potentially reach\ncatastrophic proportions. Here we briefly discuss several\nmodels with non-stationary debt. Thus far, we did not\nconsider the interest rates. Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko\n\n\f8\n(2000) studied a simple model with different interest rates\nfor deposits into and loans from a bank. Computer simulations found that money distribution among the agents\nis still exponential, but the money temperature slowly\nchanges in time. Depending on the choice of parameters, the total amount of money in circulation either\nincreases or decreases in time. Interest amplifies destabilizing effect of debt, because positive balances become\neven more positive and negative even more negative due\nto accruement of interest. A more sophisticated macroeconomic model studied by the economist Steve Keen\n(1995, 2000) exhibits debt-induced breakdown, where\nall economic activity stops under the burden of heavy\ndebt and cannot be restarted without a \"debt moratorium\". The interest rates were fixed in these models and\nnot adjusted self-consistently. Cockshott and Cottrell\n(2008) proposed a mechanism, where the interest rates\nare set to cover probabilistic withdrawals of deposits\nfrom a bank. In an agent-based simulation of the model,\nCockshott and Cottrell (2008) found that money supply\nfirst increases up to a certain limit, and then the economy experiences a spectacular crash under the weight of\naccumulated debt.\nIn the absence of a nominal limit on maximal debt,\nbankruptcy provides a mechanism for debt stabilization.\nWhen the debt of an agent becomes too large, the agent\nwill not be able to borrow any more money and will not\nbe able to pay the debt back, so he or she will have\nto declare bankruptcy. Bankruptcy erases the debt of\nthe agent (the negative money) and resets the balance\nto zero. However, somebody else (a bank or a lender)\ncounted this debt as a positive asset, which also becomes erased. In the language of physics, creation of\ndebt is analogous to particle-antiparticle generation (creation of positive and negative money), whereas cancellation of debt by repayment or by bankruptcy corresponds\nto particle-antiparticle annihilation (annihilation of positive and negative money). The former process dominates\nduring economic bubbles (booms) and represents monetary expansion, whereas the latter dominates during the\nsubsequent recessions (busts) and represents monetary\ncontraction. Bankruptcy is the crucial mechanism for\nstabilizing money distribution, but it is often overlooked\nby the economists. Interest rates are meaningless without\na mechanism specifying when bankruptcy is triggered.\nAfter lending money out, the lender has the burden\nof collecting the debt from the debtor. Thus, the act of\nlending creates a persistent link (a string) between the\nlender and the borrower, as emphasized in the Chapter\nby Heiner Ganssmann in this Volume. This is in contrast\nto payments by positive money for goods and services,\nwhich are final and do not leave any persistent link between the agents after the transaction. Invention of the\ninfamous collateralized debt obligations (CDO) obscured\nconnections between lenders and borrowers by randomizing and anonymizing their pools. It destabilized the system by inviting unsustainable debt and made bankruptcy\nproceedings extremely difficult because of the scrambled\n\nidentities of lenders and borrowers.\nAs argued above, boundary conditions are crucial for\nstabilizing money distribution. Typically, a lower bound\nis imposed, but not an upper bound (in a capitalist, as\nopposed to a socialist, society).5 This asymmetry is very\nimportant for stability of a monetary system. Numerous attempts were made to create alternative community\nmoney from scratch and most of them failed. In such a\nsystem, when an agent provides goods or services to another agent, their accounts are credited with positive and\nnegative tokens, as in Eq. (5). However, because the initial global money balance is zero in this case, the probability distribution of money P (m) is symmetric with\nrespect to positive and negative m. Unless a boundary\ncondition is imposed on the lower side, P (m) will never\nstabilize. Some agents will accumulate unlimited negative balance by consuming goods and services and not\ncontributing anything in return, thus undermining the\nsystem. In contrast, when a central government creates\npositive money by fiat and forces its usage by demanding\nthat taxes are paid with this money, it creates a viable\nmonetary system, as discussed in the Chapter by Randall Wray in this Volume. Thus, taxation is an essential\ningredient for vitality of a monetary system.\n\nVII. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nIn this Chapter, we have demonstrated that random\ntransfers of money in economic transactions between otherwise equal economic agents produce a broad and highly\nunequal probability distribution of money among the\nagents. In additive models, the probability distribution\nof money is exponential and similar to the BoltzmannGibbs distribution of energy in statistical physics. Multiplicative models produce a Gamma-like distribution and\na power-law tail for random saving propensity. Local\nconservation of money in transactions between agents is\ncrucial for the accounting function of money. Ordinary\neconomic agents can only receive and give money, but\ncannot produce it. Boundary conditions are necessary\nin order to achieve a stable probability distribution of\nmoney. Without debt, zero money balance is the boundary. When debt is permitted, some sort of restriction\non the negative money balances must be imposed, either\nby limiting individual or collective debt or by setting up\nconditions for bankruptcy. When debt is unlimited, the\nsystem is unstable and does not have a stationary state.\nIt would be very interesting to compare these theoretical conclusions with empirical data on money\ndistribution. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to obtain\n\n5\n\nIf an upper limit is imposed instead of a lower limit, the money\ntemperature in Eq. (7) becomes negative Tm < 0, so the slope in\nFig. 1 changes to dP/dm > 0, which is known in physics as the\ninverse population. The case with both upper and lower limits\nwas studied by Dr\u0103gulescu and Yakovenko (2000).\n\n\f9\nsuch data. The probability distribution of balances on\ndeposit accounts in a big enough bank would be a reasonable approximation for money distribution among the\npopulation. However, such data are not publicly available. In contrast, plenty of data are available on income\ndistribution from the tax agencies. Quantitative analysis\nof such data for the USA (Yakovenko and Rosser, 2009)\nshows that the population consists of two distinct social\nclasses. Income distribution follows the exponential law\nfor the lower class (about 97% of population) and the\npower law for the upper class (about 3% of population).\nAlthough social classes have been known since Karl\nMarx, it is interesting that they can be recognized by\nfitting the empirical data with simple mathematical\nfunctions. Using sophisticated models of interacting\neconomic agents, the computer scientist Ian Wright\n(2005, 2009) demonstrated emergence of two classes\nin agent-based simulations of initially equal agents.\nThis work has been further developed in the book by\nCockshott, Cottrell, Michaelson, Wright, and Yakovenko\n(2009), integrating economics, computer science, and\nphysics.\nNowadays, money is typically represented by data bits\non computer accounts, which constitute the informational layer of the economy. In contrast, material standards of living are determined by the physical layer of\nthe economy. In the modern society, physical standards\nof living are largely determined by the level of energy\nconsumption and are widely different around the globe.\nBanerjee and Yakovenko (2010) found that the probability distribution of energy consumption per capita around\nthe world approximately follows the exponential law. So,\nit is likely that the energy consumption inequality is governed by the same principles as the money inequality.\nThe energy/ecology and financial/economic crises are the\nbiggest challenges faced by the mankind today. There is\nan urgent need to find ways for a manageable and realistic transition from the current breakneck growth-oriented\neconomy, powered by ever-expanding use of fossil energy\nfuels, to a stable and sustainable society, based on renewable energy and balance with the Nature. Undoubtedly,\nboth money and energy will be the key factors shaping\nup the future of human civilization.\n\nReferences\nAngle, J., 1986, \"The surplus theory of social stratification\nand the size distribution of personal wealth,\" Social Forces\n65, 293\u2013326.\nAngle, J., 1992, \"The inequality process and the distribution\nof income to blacks and whites,\" Journal of Mathematical\nSociology 17, 77\u201398.\nAngle, J., 1993, \"Deriving the size distribution of personal\nwealth from 'the rich get richer, the poor get poorer',\"\nJournal of Mathematical Sociology 18, 27\u201346.\nAngle, J., 1996, \"How the Gamma Law of income distribution\nappears invariant under aggregation,\" Journal of Mathematical Sociology 21, 325\u2013358.\n\nAngle, J., 2002, \"The statistical signature of pervasive competition on wage and salary incomes,\" Journal of Mathematical Sociology 26, 217\u2013270.\nAngle, J., 2006, \"The Inequality Process as a wealth maximizing process,\" Physica A 367, 388\u2013414.\nAusloos, M., and A.
