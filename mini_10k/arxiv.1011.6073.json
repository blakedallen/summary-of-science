With a\ntypical mass of about M = 1.4M\u2299 but a radius of only about 12 km, the average density in\nNSs is several times that in atomic nuclei. Their extreme compactness makes them a natural\nlaboratory to test our knowledge about general relativity and properties of dense neutronrich nuclear matter [1]. Moreover, their generally large angular momentum and possible\nquadrupole deformation make them strong candidates among many possible sources to emit\ngravitational waves (GWs) [2]. It is well known that the estimated central density of some\nNSs may be higher than the predicted hadron-quark phase transition density, and thus there\nmight be a quark core in these so-called hybrid stars, see, e.g., ref. [3] for a recent review.\nMoreover, some originally hadronic NSs with central densities below but close to the hadronquark transition density might increase their central densities due to, for example, their\nspin-downs [4] or the accretion of masses from their binary companions [5]. Therefore, the\nhadron-quark phase transition may occur in their cores, turning them into hybrid NSs as they\nevolve. Consequently, a micro-collapse is expected to occur as a result of the softer equation\nof state (EOS) of quark matter than that of hadronic matter. Because of the difference in\nthe binding energies for the pure hyperonic and hybrid configurations of NSs, some energy\nwill be released from the NS after the hadron-quark phase transition. To understand the\nmechanism of the hadron-quark phase transition and the associated energy release, their\ndependence on properties of the dense hadronic and quark matter, the way the energy\nrelease being dissipated in NSs or carried away by gravitational waves, and the gravitational\nwave signatures of the EOS of dense matter and the expected hadron-quark phase transition\nare among the many interesting questions currently under intense investigations in neutron\nstar physics and gravitational wave astronomy, see, e.g., refs. [3, 6\u201312].\nIn a recent work involving some of us [13], several model EOSs for hybrid stars were\nobtained from an isospin- and momentum-dependent effective interaction (MDI) [13, 14]\nfor the baryon octet, the MIT bag model for the quark matter [15, 16] and the Gibbs construction for the hadron-quark phase transition [17, 18]. Since there have been many other\nstudies using similar approaches in the literature, it is especially worth mentioning that\nwhile the isospin-symmetric part of the hadronic EOSs used in this work is constrained\nby the experimental data on collective flow and kaon production in relativistic heavy-ion\n2\n\n\fcollisions [19], the symmetry energy term at sub-saturation densities is constrained in a\nnarrow range by the experimental data on isospin diffusion in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies [20]. The obtained EOSs with various bag constants were then used in\nstudying the main features of the hadron-quark phase transitions and the resulting massradius correlations of hybrid stars. With this paper as a continuation of our recent work in\nrefs. [13, 21\u201325], we make new contributions to the fast growing field of nuclear astrophysics\nin two ways. First of all, critical for understanding the physics of the hadron-quark phase\ntransition are the EOSs of both the hadronic and quark matter. Despite of the great efforts\nmade by both the astrophysics and the nuclear physics community, our current knowledge\nabout the EOS of dense matter either in the hadronic or quark phase is still very poor. More\nspecifically, for the neutron-rich hadronic matter the most uncertain part of the EOS is the\ndensity dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy which encodes the energy associated\nwith the neutron-proton asymmetry [20]. For the quark matter within the MIT bag model,\nthe most uncertain part of its EOS is the bag constant which measures the inward pressure\non the surface of the bag to balances the outward pressure originating from the Fermi motion\nand interactions of quarks confined in the bag. It is thus of interest and also necessary to\nexamine the relative effects of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and\nthe bag constant on the total energy release due to the hadron-quark phase transition in\nNSs. Secondly, a part of the energy release may be carried away by GWs. The maximum\namplitude of the latter can then be obtained by assuming that all the released energy is\navailable for GWs. Besides testing a fundamental prediction of general relativity, gravitational waves hold the great promises to open up a completely new non-electromagnetic\nwindow into the Universe. On the other hand, if detected in the future, the GWs may also\nhelp probe properties of dense neutron-rich nuclear matter in NSs. Thus, it is important to\nexamine the imprints of the nuclear symmetry energy and the bag constant on the frequency\nand damping time of GWs. In this work, we focus on the first axial w-mode of GWs due to\nthe disturbance of the space-time curvature [26]. We find that the energy release obtained\nusing the Gibbs construction for the quark-hadron phase transition is much more sensitive\nto the bag constant than the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. Furthermore, the frequency of the w-mode is found to be significantly different with or without the\nhadron-quark phase transition and depends strongly on the value of the bag constant B for\na given density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. However, when a larger bag\n3\n\n\fconstant is used such that the hadron-quark phase transition happens at a higher baryon\ndensity, effects of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy also become very\nimportant.\nThis article is organized as follows. In Section II, we summarize the MDI interaction, the\nMIT bag model, and the resulting model EOSs for hybrid stars obtained using the Gibbs\nconstruction. In Section III, the total energy release from hadron-quark phase transition\nin NSs and its dependence on the symmetry energy and the bag constant are presented.\nIn Section IV, the frequency and damping time of the axial w-mode of GWs and their\ndependence on the symmetry energy and the bag constant are studied. Finally, a summary\nis given in Section V.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL EQUATIONS OF STATE FOR HYBRID STARS\n\nSince we are mostly interested in examining the relative effects of the nuclear symmetry\nenergy and the bag constant on the total energy release during the hadron-quark phase\ntransition in neutron stars as well as the frequency and damping time of the w-mode of\nemitted GWs, we first illustrate their effects on the EOS of hybrid stars by using the model\nintroduced in ref. [13]. For completeness and to facilitate the discussions, we briefly summarize the EOSs for hybrid stars obtained in ref. [13] using the MDI interaction for the\nbaryon octet, the MIT bag model for the quark matter and the Gibbs construction for the\nhadron-quark phase transition. We refer the reader to ref. [13] for details.\nAssuming that the nucleon-hyperon and hyperon-hyperon interactions have the same\ndensity and momentum dependence as the nucleon-nucleon interaction with the interaction\nparameters fitted to known experimental data at normal nuclear matter density, the potential\nenergy density of a hypernuclear matter due to interactions between any two baryons is\nX \u0014 Abb\u2032\nBbb\u2032 \u03c1\u03c3\u22121\nA\u2032bb\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(1)\n(\u03c1\u03c4b \u03c1\u03c4b\u2032\u2032 \u2212 x\u03c4b \u03c4b\u2032 \u03c1\u03c4b \u03c1\u03c4b\u2032\u2032 )\n\u03c1\u03c4b \u03c1\u03c4b\u2032 +\n\u03c4b \u03c4b \u03c1\u03c4b \u03c1\u03c4b\u2032 +\nVbb =\n\u03c3\n2\u03c1\n2\u03c1\n\u03c3\n+\n1\n\u03c1\n0\n0\n0\n\u03c4b ,\u03c4b\u2032\u2032\n#\nC\u03c4b ,\u03c4b\u2032\u2032 Z Z 3 3 \u2032 f\u03c4b (~r, ~p)f\u03c4b\u2032\u2032 (~r, ~p\u2032 )\n+\nd pd p\n,\n\u03c10\n1 + (~p \u2212 p~\u2032 )2 /\u039b2\nwhere b (b\u2032 ) denotes the baryon octet included in the present study, i.e., N, \u039b, \u03a3, and \u039e.\nThe conventions for the isospin are \u03c4N = \u22121 for neutron and 1 for proton, \u03c4\u039b = 0 for \u039b,\n\u03c4\u03a3 = \u22121 for \u03a3\u2212 , 0 for \u03a30 and 1 for \u03a3+ , and \u03c4\u039e = \u22121 for \u039e\u2212 and 1 for \u039e0 .

The parameter x is used to model\nthe isospin dependence of the interaction between two baryons. Its value can be adjusted\nto mimic different density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and is taken to be 0\nor \u22121 in the present study. Shown in Fig. 1 is the corresponding density dependence of the\nnuclear symmetry energy Esym (\u03c1). It is worth noting that the latest experimental constraints\non Esym (\u03c1) at sub-saturation densities are consistent with but span a region larger than the\none covered by the x = 0 and x = \u22121 curves [27]. The experimental constraints on Esym (\u03c1)\nat supra-saturation densities are, on the other hand, still very uncertain. In fact, the high\ndensity behavior of Esym (\u03c1) is considered the most uncertain part of the EOS of dense\nneutron-rich nuclear matter [28]. One of the purposes of this work is to study effects of the\nsymmetry energy. As shown in Fig. 1, the choice of x = 0 and x = \u22121 allows the variation\nof the symmetry energy in a large range at supra-saturation densities.\nTo obtain the complete EOS for hybrid stars, besides the EOS for hyperons described\nabove, the MIT bag model for the quark matter [15, 16] and the Gibbs construction for the\nhadron-quark phase transition [17, 18] have been used in ref. [13]. As in previous studies, see,\ne.g., refs. [29, 30], the hybrid star is divided into three parts from the center to the surface:\nthe liquid core, the inner crust, and the outer crust. It is in the liquid core where the matter\n5\n\n\fx=0\n\n100\n\n-3\n\nP(MeV fm )\n\n-3\n\nP(MeV fm )\n\n100\n\n10\nnpe\n\nmatter\n\nMDI Hyp-R\ninteraction\n\n1\n\n1/4\n\nB\n\n1/4\n\nB\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n=170MeV\n\nx=-1\n\n10\nnpe\n\ninteraction\n\n1\n\n1/4\n\nB\n\n1/4\n\n=180MeV\n\n4\n\nB\n\n5\n\nmatter\n\nMDI Hyp-R\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n=170MeV\n=180MeV\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The EOSs of pure npe\u03bc matter (nucleonic), hyperonic matter (MDI Hyp-R\ninteraction) and hybrid stars with B 1/4 = 180 MeV and 170 MeV, and symmetry energy parameter\nx = 0 (left window) and x = \u22121 (right window).\n\ncan be pure hadrons, quarks or a mixture of the two. In the inner crust, a parameterized EOS\nof P = a + b\u01eb4/3 is used as in refs. [29, 30]. The outer crust usually consists of heavy nuclei\nand the electron gas, where the BPS EOS [31] is used. The transition density \u03c1t between\nthe liquid core and the inner crust has been consistently determined in refs. [29, 30]. Taking\nthe density separating the inner from the outer crust to be \u03c1out = 2.46 \u00d7 10\u22124 fm\u22123 , the\nparameters a and b can then be determined using the pressures and energy densities at\n\u03c1t and \u03c1out . Shown in Fig. 2 are the EOSs with x = 0 and x = \u22121, respectively, both\nusing the MIT bag constant B 1/4 = 180 MeV and 170 MeV. For comparisons, the pure\nnpe\u03bc (labeled as nucleonic) and hyperonic (labeled as MDI Hyp-R interaction) EOSs are\nalso included. As it is well known, the appearance of hyperons and the hadron-quark phase\ntransition softens the EOS of neutron star matter. Also, it is worth noting that the adiabatic\ncoefficient \u03b3 = d log(P )/d log(\u03c1) at saturation density is 2.63 and 2.57 for x = 0 and x = \u22121,\nrespectively. The EOSs with x = 0 and x = \u22121 are thus about the same below and around\nthe saturation density. However, it is interesting to see that the starting point and the degree\nof softening due to the appearance of hyperons are sensitive to Esym (\u03c1) at high densities.\nMoreover, the Esym (\u03c1) also affects appreciably the starting point of the hadron-quark mixed\nphase especially with the larger bag constant. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the starting\npoint is much more sensitive to the bag constant B for a given symmetry energy parameter\nx. These features are consistent with those first noticed by Kutschera et al. [32]. It is also\nimportant to emphasize that since the mixed phase is described using the Gibbs instead\n6\n\n\fof the Maxwell construction, the energy density thus increases continuously with pressure\nacross the mixed phase without a jump [33]. Consequently, the Sidov criterium that a\nstable hybrid star must satisfy [7, 34], i.e.,\n\n\u01ebq\n\u01ebH\n\n<\n\n3\n(1\n2\n\n+\n\nP\n)\n\u01ebH\n\nwith P, \u01ebq and \u01ebH denoting,\n\nrespectively, the pressure, the energy density of quarks and hadrons at the transition point,\nis automatically satisfied.\n\nIII.\n\nTOTAL ENERGY RELEASE DUE TO HADRON-QUARK PHASE TRANSI-\n\nTION IN NEUTRON STARS\n\nThe amount of energy release during the micro-collapse of a neutron star triggered by\nthe hadron-quark phase transition is given by the change in its binding energy before and\nafter the phase transition. The binding energy of a neutron star can be obtained from\nfirst solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation with the corresponding EOS\n(G = c = 1),\n(m(r) + 4\u03c0r 3 P (r))(\u01eb(r) + P (r))\ndP (r)\n=\u2212\n,\ndr\nr(r \u2212 2m(r))\ndm(r)\n= 4\u03c0\u01eb(r)r 2 ,\ndr\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P (r) and \u01eb(r) are the pressure and the energy density at radius r. The binding energy\nof a neutron star is then given by [35]\nEb = Mg \u2212 Mbar ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Mg is the gravitational mass of the neutron star measured from infinity [36], i.e.,\nZ R\nMg =\n4\u03c0r 2 \u01eb(r)dr.\n(4)\n0\n\nThe Mbar is the baryonic mass of the neutron star, namely, the mass when all the matter in\nthe neutron star is dispersed to infinity [35]. It can be calculated from Mbar = NMB , where\nMB = 1.66 \u00d7 10\u221224 g is the nucleon mass and N is the total number of baryons [35], i.e.,\n\u0015\u22121/2\n\u0014\nZ R\n2m(r)\n2\n\u03c1B (r)dr\n(5)\nN=\n4\u03c0r 1 \u2212\nr\n0\nwith \u03c1B (r) being the baryon density profile of the neutron star. While the total energy\nrelease Eg during the phase transition is the difference of Eq. (3) before and after the microcollapse, it reduces to the difference in gravitational mass for a hadronic (h) and a hybrid\n7\n\n\fstar (q) as a result of baryon number conservation, namely,\nEg = Mg,h \u2212 Mg,q .\n\nx=-1, B\n\n(6)\n\n1/4\n\n=170MeV\n\nx=0, B\n\n1/4\n\n52.0\n\nx=-1, B\n\n=170MeV\n\n1/4\n\ng\n\nlog(E )(erg)\n\n52.5\n\n=180MeV\n\n51.5\n\nx=0, B\n\n1/4\n\n51.0\n\n=180MeV\n\n50.5\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\nM\n\nbar\n\n1.5\n\n/M\n\nFIG. 3: Total energy release due to the hadron-quark phase transition as a function of the baryonic\nmass of a neutron star.\n\nTABLE I: The baryon number (N ), gravitational masses of hyperonic stars (Mg (H)), hybrid stars\n(Mg (HQ)), the quark core including the mixed phase (Mg (core)), the radii of hyperonic (R(H))\nand hybrid stars (R(HQ)) as well as the energy release (Eg ) with x = 0 and B 1/4 = 170 MeV.

It is seen\nthat the energy release increases with Mbar /M\u2299 and is higher with the smaller (B 1/4 = 170\nMeV) bag constant B but stiffer (x = \u22121) symmetry energy. Effects of varying the bag\nconstant B are obviously more significant than varying the symmetry energy parameter x,\nespecially on the core mass and thus the energy release. The variation of the bag constant\nB also affects appreciably the radii of hybrid stars. On the other hand, the variation of the\nsymmetry energy parameter x only has appreciable effects on the radii of both hyperonic and\nhybrid stars. It's effects on the energy release is much smaller than the bag constant B. It is\nworth noting that it was first shown in ref. [37] that the binding energies of NSs consisting\nof pure npe\u03bc matter depend strongly on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry\nenergy. It is easily understandable that the difference in binding energies before and after\nthe hadron-quark phase transition becomes less sensitive to the symmetry energy. Some\nof these features can be better understood from inspecting the gravitational mass-radius\nand mass-central density correlations with and without the hadron-quark phase transition\n9\n\n\fTABLE IV: Same as I but with x = \u22121 and B 1/4 = 180 MeV.\nN\n\nMg (H) Mg (HQ) Mg (core) R(H)\n\nR(HQ) log(Eg )(erg)\n\n1.4E57 1.0911 1.0904\n\n0.389260 12.5570 11.8321 51.0467\n\n1.5E57 1.1632 1.1616\n\n0.563910 12.5975 11.4949 51.4673\n\n1.6E57 1.2346 1.2314\n\n0.716042 12.6178 11.2027 51.7548\n\n1.7E57 1.3052 1.3999\n\n0.855991 12.6185 10.9207 51.9731\n\n1.8E57 1.3749 1.3670\n\n0.990235 12.5998 10.6140 52.1525\n\nusing different bag constants and symmetry energy functionals. Shown in Fig. 4 are the\ngravitational mass Mg as a function of radius R and central density \u03c1c for several relevant\ncases. It is seen that with B 1/4 = 170 MeV the phase transition happens at a significantly\nlower density, resulting in a smaller maximum mass than the case with B 1/4 = 180 MeV.\nOn the other hand, for a given bag constant B, the hyperonic EOS is stiffer with a stiffer\nsymmetry energy, leading to a larger radius and thus a lower central density and a smaller\nmaximum mass.

They are also useful for explaining why we study in detail in the next section\nthe frequency and damping time of the w-mode of GWs. Generally, the magnitude of GWs\n10\n\n\fis denoted by the gravitational strain amplitude in the following wave form:\nh(t) = h0 e\u2212(t/\u03c4g\u03c9 ) sin(\u03c90 t),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere h0 is the initial amplitude, \u03c90 is the angular frequency and \u03c4g\u03c9 is the damping\ntimescale. Assuming all energy release Eg is available to GW emission, the maximum value\nof the initial amplitude is then [38]\n\u0014 \u00151/2\n4\nEg\nh0 =\n,\n\u03c90 D \u03c4g\u03c9\n\n(8)\n\nwhere D is the distance of the source from the detector. Thus, the maximum strain amplitude is directly determined by the energy release. However, not all the energy release is\navailable for emitting gravitational waves [7] as the energy can be dissipated by other mechanisms. In fact, most of the energy release from the hadron-quark phase transition would be\nused to excite radial oscillations [39]. Moreover, the pure radial models do not generate any\ngravitational waves unless they are coupled with rotation [40]. However, because of angular\nmomentum conservation, rotating neutron stars are more likely to be formed during supernova explosions. If there are some other dissipating mechanisms of timescale \u03c4d during the\nhadron-quark phase transition in neutron stars, the fraction of energy dissipated by gravitational waves is then approximately fg = 1/(1 + \u03c4g\u03c9 /\u03c4d ) [7]. Thus, the relative damping\ntimescale of the GWs with respect to that due to other mechanisms determines the fraction\nof the total energy release that can be carried away by GWs. In the literature, time scales\nof various GW modes and various energy dissipation mechanisms have been considered, see,\ne.g., refs. [7, 40] and references therein. As for many other interesting questions in the field,\nthe conclusions so far are still very model dependent.\n\nIV.\n\nFREQUENCY AND DAMPING TIME OF THE AXIAL w-MODE OF GRAV-\n\nITATIONAL WAVES\n\nGWs from non-radial oscillations of NSs carry important information about their internal\nstructures [41\u201343]. One special type of normal modes of oscillations that only exists in\ngeneral relativity is the so called w-mode associated with the perturbation of the space-time\ncurvature and for which the motion of the fluid is negligible [26]. While the frequencies of\nthe w-mode is significantly above the operating frequencies of existing GW detectors, it is\n11\n\n\fnevertheless useful to further investigate what information about the internal structure of\nNSs may be revealed from a future detection of the w-mode of GWs.\nAccording to Chandrasekhar & Ferrari [26], the axial perturbation equations for a static\nneutron star can be simplified by introducing a function z(r) that is constructed from the radial part of the perturbed axial metric components. It satisfies a Schr\u00f6dinger-like differential\nequation\n\nd2 z\n+ [\u03c9 2 \u2212 V (r)]z = 0\ndr\u22172\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c9(= \u03c90 +i\u03c9i ) is the complex eigen-frequency of the axial w-mode and r\u2217 is the tortoise\ncoordinate defined by\nd\nd\n= e\u03bb\u2212\u03bd\n(10)\ndr\u2217\ndr\nwhere the e\u03bd and e\u03bb are the metric functions given by the line element for a static neutron\nstar [26]. Inside a neutron star, the potential function V is defined by\ne2\u03bd\nV = 3 [l(l + 1)r + 4\u03c0r 3(\u03c1(r) \u2212 P (r)) \u2212 6m(r)]\nr\n\n(11)\n\nwith l the spherical harmonics index (used in describing the perturbed metric and only the\ncase l = 2 is considered here), \u03c1(r) and P (r) the density and pressure, and m(r) the mass\ninside radius r, respectively. Outside the neutron star, Eq. (11) reduces to\nV =\n\nr \u2212 2Mg\n[l(l + 1)r \u2212 6Mg ]\nr4\n\n(12)\n\nwhere Mg is the total gravitational mass of the neutron star. The solutions to this problem\nare subject to a set of boundary conditions (BC) constructed by Chandrasekhar & Ferrari\n[26]: regular BC at the neutron star center, continuous BC at the surface and behaving as a\npurely outgoing wave at infinity. In a recent work [25] using the continued fraction method\n[44, 45], some of us have studied the frequency and damping time of the axial w-mode for NSs\ncontaining only the npe\u03bc matter. It was found that the density dependence of the symmetry\nenergy has strong imprints on both the frequency and damping time of the axial w-mode.\nIn this section, we examine how the appearance of hyperons and the hadron-quark phase\ntransition may affect the frequency and damping time of the axial w-mode. As mentioned\nearlier, we focus on the relative effects of the symmetry energy and the bag constant on the\nfirst w-mode.\nShown in Fig. 5 is the frequency as a function of the neutron star compactness Mg /R\nfor the four situations considered, i.e., pure npe\u03bc star, hyperonic star, and hybrid stars\n12\n\n\f9.5\n\n9.5\n\nx=-1\n\n1/4\n\nB\n\n=170MeV\n\n9.0\n\n9.0\n\n1/4\n\nB\n\n=180MeV\n\n(kHz)\n\n(kHz)\n\n=170MeV\n\n1/4\n\n8.5\n\n8.5\n\n1/4\n\nB\n\nMDI Hyp-R\ninteraction\n\n8.0\n\nB\n\n=180MeV\n\n8.0\nMDI Hyp-R\n\nnpe\n\n7.5\n\ninteraction\n\nmatter\n\nnpe\n\nmatter\n\n7.5\n\nx=0\n\n7.0\n\n7.0\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.10\n\n0.25\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\nM /R\n\n0.25\n\nM /R\n\ng\n\ng\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Frequency of the first w-mode as a function of the neutron star compactness\nMg /R with the symmetry energy parameter x = 0 (left window) and x = \u22121 (right window).\n\nwith two different values for the bag constant. It is interesting to see that the frequency is\nvery sensitive to the EOS used. This is consistent with the earlier findings in refs. [25, 43]\nwhere a large ensemble of hadronic EOSs were used to describe the npe\u03bc matter. Compared\nto these previous studies, it is seen that as the EOS softens when hyperons appear or the\nhadron-quark phase transition happens, the frequency increases quickly. It is also seen that\nthe effect of the hadron-quark phase transition is dramatic. Comparing results in the two\nfigures with x = 0 and x = \u22121, it is seen that the bag constant B plays a much stronger\nrole than the symmetry energy parameter x.\n50\n\n50\n\nnpe\n\nnpe\n\nmatter\n\nMDI Hyp-R\n\ninteraction\n\ninteraction\n1/4\n\nB\n\n1/4\n\n=180MeV\n\n1/4\n\n=170MeV\n\n30\n\nx=0\n\n20\n\n0.10\n\n1/4\n\nB\nB\n\ns\n\nB\n\n40\n\n( s)\n\n40\n\nmatter\n\nMDI Hyp-R\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n=180MeV\n=170MeV\n\n30\n\nx=-1\n\n20\n\n0.25\n\nM /R\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nM /R\n\ng\n\ng\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Damping time of the first w-mode as a function of the neutron star compactness Mg /R with the symmetry energy parameter x = 0 (left window) and x = \u22121 (right\nwindow).\n\n13\n\n\fShown in Fig. 6 is the damping time as a function of Mg /R for the four situations\nconsidered. It is seen that the damping time is longer for more compact NSs. Effects of the\nEOS on the damping time are appreciable but not as strong as those on the frequency.

For the softer EOS with B 1/4 = 170 MeV, the effect of the symmetry energy is small.\nOn the other hand, for the stiffer EOS with B 1/4 = 180 MeV, the density dependence of the\nsymmetry energy can affect the frequency significantly. This is because the hadron-quark\ntransition happens at a higher baryon density when a large bag constant is used as shown\nin Fig. 2. The symmetry energy in the hadronic phase then also plays an important role\nin determining the structure of NSs. Nevertheless, comparing frequencies with the same x\nparameter but different values of B, it is clear that the bag constant has a much stronger\neffect as it changes the underlying EOS of dense matter more significantly.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nUsing an isospin- and momentum-dependent effective interaction for the baryon octet\nand the MIT bag model to describe, respectively, the hadronic and quark phases of neutron\n14\n\n\fstars, we have investigated the maximum available energy for gravitational wave emission\ndue to the micro-collapse triggered by the hadron-quark phase transition in neutron stars.\nMoreover, the frequency and damping time of the first axial w-mode of gravitational waves\nhave been studied for both hadronic and hybrid NSs. Since the most uncertain part of the\nEOS of a neutron star is the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy in the\nneutron-rich nucleonic matter and the bag constant in the quark matter within the MIT\nbag model, we have studied effects of the symmetry energy and bag constant on the energy\nrelease as well as the frequency and damping time of the first axial w-mode of GWs from\nneutron stars. We have found that the energy release is much more sensitive to the bag\nconstant than the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. The frequency of\nthe w-mode has been found to be significantly different with or without the hadron-quark\nphase transition and depends strongly on the bag constant. Effects of the symmetry energy\nand bag constant on the damping time have also been found to be appreciable but not as\nstrong as those on the frequency. We have further found that the effect of the symmetry\nenergy on the frequency becomes stronger with a larger value of the bag constant that\nleads to a higher hadron-quark transition density. While the predicted frequency of the wmode is significantly above the bands of operating frequencies of the existing GW detectors,\nour results have indicated that the frequency of the w-mode can indeed carry important\ninformation about the internal structure of NSs and the properties of dense neutron-rich\nmatter.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThis work was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation Grant Nos.\nPHY-0757839 and PHY-0758115, the Welch Foundation under Grant No. A-1358, the Texas\nCoordinating Board of Higher Education Grant No.003565-0004-2007, the Young Teachers'\nTraining Program from China Scholarship Council under Grant No. 2007109651, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.10947023 and the Fundamental\nResearch Funds for the Central University, China under Grant No.2009ZM0193.\n\n[1] J.
