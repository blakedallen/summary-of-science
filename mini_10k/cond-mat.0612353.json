Further\nmotivation is provided by the possibility to study the\neffect of reduced dimensions on carrier transport10 and\noptical properties11\u201313 .\nThe confinement of the carriers in all three dimensions\non a nanometer scale is achieved, for example, by embedding regions of a material with a smaller bandgap in\na matrix of a wider bandgap material. A widespread\nmethod of creating such quantum dots (QDs) is the\nStranski-Krastanow growth mode14\u201316 .\nIn this fast evolving research field, nanostructures\nbased on conventional group-III nitrides like AlN, GaN,\nand InN gained more interest in recent years. Compared\nto group-III arsenide semiconductor materials, nitridebased nanostructures have the advantage that it is possible to span a much larger spectral range, presently from\namber to ultraviolet, by properly alloying together the\nthree building blocks and thereby engineering the direct\nband gap of these materials17 .\nNevertheless and despite the intense research on nitride QDs over the last decade the understanding of this\nmaterial system is \u2013 compared to other III-V materials \u2013\nstill in its infancy.\nFrom the theoretical point of view, one challenge is\nthe proper inclusion of effects that stem from the altered\natomistic structure of the underlying lattice. While most\nof the nitrides can crystallize both in the zinc-blende and\nthe wurtzite phase, the latter is by far more stable18 .\nAdditionally, the strong built-in field needs to be considered for, the mostly applied growth along the c-axis. In\n\ncontrast to many other III-V semiconductors, the spinorbit coupling in the nitrides is rather weak17 so that the\ncalculation of the electronic states in terms of a simple\neffective-mass approximation is not possible due to strong\nvalence band mixing effects. Instead, especially for small\nnanostructures, a microscopic description of the singleparticle states based on, for example, a tight-binding\nmodel or pseudo-potential calculation is necessary.\nIn the past many experimental and theoretical investigations addressed the optical properties of III-V and\nII-VI QD structures based on, e. g., InGaAs/GaAs or\nCdSe/ZnSe. One important aspect concerned the analysis of absorption and emission spectra of QDs as a function of the excitation density1,11,13,19\u201325 . A common result is that the optical processes mainly involve 'diagonal' transitions, that are connecting, for example, s-shell\nelectrons with s-shell holes or p-shell electrons with pshell holes. In envelope-function approximation this is\ntraced back to dipole matrix elements calculated from\nthe Bloch functions, and interband transition amplitudes\ndetermined by the product of dipole matrix elements and\nthe overlap of the electron and hole envelope functions.\nThis picture has been proven to be very fruitful for conventional III-V materials and is oftentimes carried over\nto the nitride system where emission spectra are then calculated using these 'diagonal' excitons.26\u201331 Our analysis\nshows, however, that for nitride QDs deviations from this\npicture are possible. We identify situations, in which the\nemission is dominated by recombination of 'skew' excitons, that are excitons which consist of s-shell electrons\nand p-shell holes or vice versa. This led to the prediction\nof dark exciton and biexction ground state emission.32\nSuch a modified selection rule cannot be explained in\nan simple effective-mass picture but requires the inclusion of band-mixing effects in a way that properly accounts for the symmetry of the underlying atomic lattice. In addition to the important changes of the opti-\n\n\f2\n\nII.\n\nELECTRONIC STRUCTURE\n\nFor a proper treatment of the single particle states\nin nitride systems, an atomistic multiband approach,\nlike pseudopotential or tight-binding (TB) models, is required. General aspects for the developement of such a\nTB approach and the calculation of dipole and Coulomb\nmatrix elements are discussed in detail in Ref. 33. In the\nfollowing Section II A, we briefly summarize the main\ningredients of the subsequently used TB model, while\nSections II B and II C are devoted to details of the calculation of single-particle states and interaction matrix\nelements.\n\nA.\n\nTight-Binding model and built-in field\n\nFor the calculation of the single-particle states we use\na TB model with an sp3 basis |\u03b1iR , that contains one\n\nholes\nE1h = 0.6256 eV\n\ne = 1.9621 eV\nE2,3\n\nh = 0.6158 eV\nE2,3\n\ns-shell\n\nelectrons\nE1e = 1.7320 eV\n\np-shell\n\ncal properties involving one and two excitons, the transitions that occur in systems with a higher population of\nexcitons differ strongly from those known from the InGaAs/GaAs system. While for smaller nitride QDs the\n\"skew\" excitons are predicted, we find that in large nitride QDs the energetic order of the s-shell and p-shell\nfor holes is interchanged, with the p-shell being lowest\nin energy. This leads to optically active exciton transitions.33 However, as a result of the quantum confined\nStark effect (QCSE), with increasing height of the QDs\nthe corresponding dipole matrix elements decrease drastically28,33,34 due to the separation of the electron and\nhole wave functions in the strong internal electric field.\nIn combination with the dark exciton state in small nitride QDs, this makes the application of nitride QDs\nmore challenging.\nIn this work we study the multi-exciton emission spectra in nitride QDs and discuss the resulting complicated\npeak structure in detail. Restricting ourselves to the two\nlowest shells allows even a semi-analytic description of\nthe problem. The single-particle states are deduced from\nan atomistic tight-binding model as briefly outlined in\nSec. II. Even without a detailed calculation of the singleparticle states, the symmetry considerations of Sec. III\ncan be used to draw conclusions regarding the dipolematrix elements and the multi-exciton spectra. In Sec. IV\nthe Hamiltonian of the interacting charge carrier system\nand the configuration interaction (CI) scheme are presented. Results for an initial filling with up to six excitons\nare provided in Section V B and major trends are discussed in Section V C in terms of an approximate Hamiltonian. Further details of the multi-exciton spectra are\nanalyzed in Section VI In the subsequent Section VII the\ninfluence of the strong built-in field is investigated. Finally, the spectra for a larger nitride QD are presented in\nSection VIII and compared to those found for the smaller\nstructure.\n\nFIG. 1: (color online). Top view of the QD structrue with\nthe first two bound shells for electrons (left) and holes (right).\nDepicted are isosurfaces of the probability density with 20%\n(blue) and 80% (red) of the maximum value are shown. Only\none state is visualized for the two-fold degenerate p-shell, as\ne,h\nthe other looks alike. The corresponding energies (E1,2,3\n) are\nmeasured relative to the valence band maximum of the bulk\nGaN.\n\ns-state (\u03b1 = s) and three p-states (\u03b1 = px , py , pz ) per\nspin direction at each atomic site R. The ith TB singleparticle wave function is given by\nX\n|\u03c6i i =\n|\u03b1iR ci\u03b1 (R)\n\u03b1,R\n\nwith the expansion coefficients denoted by ci\u03b1 (R). We\nassume a lens-shaped InN QD, grown in (0001)-direction\non top of an InN wetting layer (WL), that is embedded\nin a GaN matrix. For the numerical evaluation, a finite\nwurtzite lattice within a supercell with fixed boundary\nconditions is chosen. The small spin-orbit coupling and\ncrystal-field splitting are neglected17 . Furthermore, we\nneglect the strain induced displacement of the atoms. For\nthe used QD geometry, a more realistic inclusion of strain\neffects does not change the symmetry of the system and\nhenceforth the general statements discussed in this paper\nshould not be affected. In the following we consider two\ndifferent QD sizes with diameters d = 4.5, 5.7 nm and\nheights h = 1.6, 2.3 nm, respectively. In both cases a\nWL thickness of one lattice constant c is assumed.\nIn contrast to cubic III-V semiconductor heterostructures, e.g., InAs or GaAs, the III-V wurtzite nitrides\nexhibit considerable larger built-in fields35 , which can\nsignificantly modify both the electronic and the optical\nproperties. This field enters via the electrostatic potential as a site-diagonal contribution Vp (R) = \u2212e\u03c6p (R) to\nthe TB Hamiltonian.36,37\nB.\n\nSingle-particle states\n\nThe small QD (d = 4.5 nm, h = 1.6 nm) confines three\nbound states for the electrons. The corresponding prob-\n\n\f3\nability densities of the first two bound shells for electrons\nand holes are presented in Fig. 1. In the calculation, the\ninfluence of the built-in field was included. The dominant\ncontribution for the electron single-particle states stems\nfrom the atomic s-orbitals, while for the hole states a\nstrong intermixing of the atomic p-orbitals is observed.\nThis is indicative for the fact that a suitable description\nof the one-particle states and the resulting optical properties requires a multi-band approach and cannot be accounted for in a one-band effective mass approximation.\nIf one compares the single-particle states with and\nwithout the inclusion of the built-in field,33 one finds\nthat, in the presence of the field, the electron states are\nsqueezed into the cap of the QD while the hole states are\nconstraint to a few atomic layers at the bottom near the\nWL. This effect is even more pronounced for the larger\nQD (d = 5.7 nm, h = 2.3 nm). In this case a clear\nspatial separation of electron and hole wave functions is\nobserved, which lowers the direct spatial overlap between\nthe two and leads to strongly reduced dipole matrix elements. Furthermore, as known from the QCSE, the builtin field leads to an overall red-shift in the single-particle\ntransition energies. In addition, we find for the large QD,\nthat the ordering of the energy levels is affected by the\nbuilt-in field. Specifically we obtain that in the presence\nof the built-in field the level ordering for the holes is reversed so that the ground state is formed by the two-fold\ndegenerate states \u03c6h2,3 (p-shell in Fig. 1) while the first excited state \u03c6h1 (s-shell in Fig. 1) is nondegenerate. This is\nin contrast to the observed level ordering of the large QD\nin the absence of the built-in field or of the small QD with\nand without the field. In these cases, the ground state is\nnondegenerate (\u03c6h1 ) and the first two excited states are\ndegenerate (\u03c6h2,3 ). Such a behavior has been reported before for other QD systems and a detailed discussion can\nbe found in Ref. 33.\n\nC.\n\nEvaluation of dipole- and interaction matrix\nelements\n\nBased on the TB single-particle wave-functions one\ncan determine dipole- and Coulomb matrix elements that\nare crucial for the calculation of optical properties. As\nemphasized above, a TB model represents an atomistic\napproach to describe the electronic structure of lowdimensional heterostructures. Explicit knowledge about\na basis set of localized (Wannier) states is not required\nfor the calculation of one-particle energies and wave functions, because the Hamiltonian matrix elements between\nthe different orbitals are treated as parameters within the\nTB model. What enters the TB calculation are only the\nbasic assumptions about the localized (atomic) orbitals:\nsymmetry, spatial orientation38 , and orthogonality.\nFor the calculation of interaction matrix elements one\nneeds \u2013 at least in principle \u2013 the localized basis states.\nFor the Coulomb matrix elements, however, the explicit\nknowledge of the atomic orbitals is not required in prac-\n\ntice, as these matrix elements are dominated by longrange contributions in which the local orbitals act as\npoint charges. The structure of the localized orbitals is of\nsignificance only for on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions, which in our calculation contribute less than 5 % to\nthe total Coulomb matrix elements. These findings are in\nagreement with Ref. 39. Thus, the matrix elements are\napproximated by a sum over the TB coefficients ci\u03b1 (R)\nat atom sites R, R\u2032 with orbital indices \u03b1, \u03b2:\nZ\nd3 r d3 r\u2032 \u03c6\u2217i (r)\u03c6\u2217j (r \u2032 )V (r \u2212 r \u2032 )\u03c6k (r \u2032 )\u03c6l (r)\nXX\nj\u2217\n\u2032 k\n\u2032 l\n\u2032\n\u2248\nci\u2217\n\u03b1 (R)c\u03b2 (R )c\u03b2 (R )c\u03b1 (R) V (R \u2212 R )\n\nVij,kl =\n\nZ\n\nRR\u2032 \u03b1\u03b2\n\ne2\nwith V (R \u2212 R\u2032 ) =\nfor R 6= R\u2032\n4\u03c0\u03b50 \u03b5r |R \u2212 R\u2032 |\nZ\n1\ne2\n.\nand V (0) = 2\nd3 r d3 r\u2032\nvuc uc\n4\u03c0\u03b50 \u03b5r |r \u2212 r\u2032 |\n\nThe labels i, j, k, l refer either to electron or to hole\nstates in order to consider the repulsive electron-electron\nand hole-hole interaction, as well as the attractive\nelectron-hole interaction. The considerably smaller matrix elements of the electron-hole exchange interaction\nare neglected. The calculation of the onsite integrals\nV (0) involves the integration over the volume of the unit\ncell vuc and can be done quasi-analytically by expansion\nof the Coulomb interaction in terms of spherical harmonics.40 The electronic charge and the vacuum dielectric\nconstant are denoted by e and \u01eb0 , respectively. We use\nthe InN dielectric constant \u03b5r = 8.4 according to Ref. 41\nsince the wave functions are almost completely confined\ninside the QD.\nFor the calculation of dipole matrix elements deh\nij \u221d\ne\nh\nh\u03c6i |r|\u03c6j i, the explicit structure of the localized orbitals\nis needed as the dipole-operator is dominated by shortrange contributions. Though being not orthogonal at\ndifferent sites, standard Slater orbitals42 have been used\nin earlier calculations43,44 within orthogonal TB models.\nWhile they include the correct symmetry properties, the\nmissing orthogonality limits their applicability. To overcome this problem, we use numerically orthogonalized\nSlater orbitals33 and account for the slight non-locality\nof the dipole operator45 and the underlying anion-cation\nstructure of the crystal by including also contributions\nfrom up to second-nearest neighbors.\nIII.\n\nSYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe specific symmetry of the system under consideration plays an important role in the prediction of energy\ndegeneracies and optical selection rules. The overall symmetry of the problem is determined by two factors: (i)\nthe crystal symmetry of the underlying lattice and (ii)\nthe symmetry of the QD geometry or, more generally,\nthe geometry of the heterostructure.46\n\n\f4\nThe interplay between the dot geometry and the underlying lattice is well illustrated by the example of the\nlens-shaped QD. The geometry of the QD has a C\u221ev\nsymmetry.47 In the effective mass approximation or in\nthe k * p theory the underlying atomic structure is not\nresolved, so that one obtains degenerate energies for the\nlens-shaped QD.46,48,49 However, if one takes the crystal structure into account, as it is done, in a TB33,50\nor pseudo-potential calculation51 , the symmetry will be\nreduced and degeneracies can be lifted.46 For a lensshaped QD grown on a wurtzite lattice along the (0001)direction, the symmetry is reduced to C3v . If a QD with\nthe same geometry is grown in the zinc-blende phase in\n(001)-direction, one is left with an even lower C2v symmetry. As we will discuss in the next subsection, the former\ngroup is still rich enough to predict degeneracies, while\nthe latter is too small to support degenerate eigenstates.\n\nA.\n\nEnergy spectrum\n\nThe C3v group is generated by the rotation around the\nz-axis with an angle of 2\u03c0/3, denoted by C3z , together\nwith a mirror reflection at a plane perpendicular to the yaxis, denoted by IC2y .52 These operations commute with\nthe Hamiltonian, but not among themselves. From this\nnon-abelian character of the group one can immediately\nconclude that there must exist energetically degenerate\nstates. In the case of the wurtzite QD under consideration, one example of such degenerate states are the p-shell\nlevels given in Fig. 1.\nThis degeneracy in the wurtzite structure is especially\nworth mentioning in view of a recent paper46 in which it\nis argued that a description at the atomic level in zincblende-based QDs should remove the p-shell degeneracy.\nThe argument is essentially the following: the four-fold\nrotation is part of the zinc-blende point group only if\nfollowed by the inversion, but many high symmetry (lensshaped, pyramidal) QDs forbid the inversion and with it\nthe C4v symmetry. One is therefore left with a C2v point\ngroup, which is abelian and therefore insufficient for pdegeneracy.\nThis conclusion is correct, but it cannot be carried over\nto the wurtzite QDs, because in wurtzite crystals the\nthree-fold rotation holds without inversion. If the QD\ngeometry is sufficiently symmetric (lens-shaped, hexagonal pyramids) then the problem retains the C3v symmetry, which leads to p-degeneracy. In papers predicting pshell splitting for QDs in wurtzite lattices and neglecting\nthe spin-orbit coupling53,54 , either boundary conditions\nor discretization meshes spoil the correct C3v symmetry\nof the problem. Therefore the small p-shell splitting obtained there is a numerical artefact. On the contrary\nthe splitting induced by the inclusion of the spin-orbit\ncoupling55 , albeit quite small, is physically correct.\nTo summarize the discussion, for a lens-shaped QD and\nin the absence of the spin-orbit coupling a degeneracy of\nthe p-shell is expected in the wurtzite phase but not in a\n\nzinc-blende structure.\n\nB.\n\nSingle-particle states\n\nSo far we discussed only the role of symmetry on the\nenergy spectrum. Turning now to the dipole selection\nrules, one should consider the symmetry properties of the\nwave functions. In the TB description the wave functions\nare expanded in the atomic orbital basis according to\n|\u03c6i =\n\nX\nR\n\n|siR a(R) +\n\nX\nR,j\n\n|pj iR bj (R) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere |siR denotes the atomic s-orbital centered around\nthe site R with hr|siR = \u03c8s (r \u2212 R), and the corresponding p-orbitals follow similarly from |pj iR with j = x, y, z.\nThe expansion coefficients are given by a(R) and bj (R),\nrespectively.\nThe action of a symmetry operation T on the wave\nfunction is defined via52,56\n(T \u03c6)(r) = \u03c6(T \u22121 r).\n\n(2)\n\nIn the case of the TB wave function, Eq. (1), this amounts\nto a simultaneous transformation of the orbitals and of\ntheir centers. Instead of the original orbitals px and py ,\nit is more convenient to\u221awork with the complex combinations p\u00b1 = (px \u00b1 ipy )/ 2 which are angular-momentum\neigenstates.\nFor a wurtzite QD with C3v symmetry one has to consider the transformation properties of the orbitals under\nthe discrete 2\u03c0/3 rotation C3z around the z-axis and the\nmirror reflection IC2y , defined by (x, y, z) \u2192 (x, \u2212y, z).\nWhile the atomic s and pz orbitals do not change under\nthese transformations, the remaining p\u00b1 orbitals transform like\nC3z |p+ i = e\u2212i\nC3z |p\u2212 i = e\n\n2\u03c0\n3\n\n+i 2\u03c0\n3\n\n|p+ i ,\n\nIC2y |p+ i = |p\u2212 i ,\n\n|p\u2212 i ,\n\nIC2y |p\u2212 i = |p+ i.\n\n(3)\n\nUsing Eq. (2) these transformation properties of the local\norbitals under the group basic rotations are carried over\nto the total wave function, given by Eq. (1). This defines the action of the group on the TB basis and allows\nthe classification of the eigenstates according to the irreducible representations of the C3v group. States which\nare invariant under the action of the group will be called\ns-states and will be denoted by |\u03c6s i. This terminology\nand notation are somewhat lax since according to it a\npz -orbital is also an s-state. Nevertheless we use them\nfor the sake of simplicity and in agreement with the literature. Similarly, the basis vectors of a two-dimensional\nrepresentation changing under the group operations like\nin Eq. (3) will be called p\u00b1 -states and will be denoted\n|\u03c6p\u00b1 i.\nAs an example, it can be shown that an s-state wave\n\n\f5\nfunction must have the form\nX\u0002\n\u0003\n|\u03c6s i =\n|siR \u03b1(R) + |pz iR \u03b2z (R)\n\n(4)\n\nR\n\n+\n\nX\u0002\nR\n\n\u0003\n\u2217\n|p+ iR ZR\n\u03b2(R) + |p\u2212 iR ZR \u03b2 \u2217 (R)\n\nwhere the coefficients \u03b1(R), \u03b2z (R), and the real part\nof \u03b2(R) are invariant under all rotations of C3v , while\nthe imaginary part of \u03b2(R) is invariant under the proper\nrotation C3z but changes sign under the action of the\nimproper rotation IC2y . The quantity\nZR is defined as\np\n2 + Y 2 ei\u03beR , where\nXR + iYR or in polar coordinates XR\nR\nXR and YR denote the in-plane cartesian coordinates of\nthe lattice site R and \u03beR is the polar angle of the point\nR in cylindrical coordinates. It is clear that with \u03b1(R),\n\u03b2z (R) rotation invariant the first sum in Eq. (4) is slike. In the second sum one has a compensation between\nthe p-behavior of the orbitals and that of the ZR coefficients leading to a combination which is left invariant\nby the rotations. The equivalent of this situation in a\nk * p approach would be expressed by the p-character\nof the envelopes multiplying to the p\u00b1 -type Bloch functions and compensating the phase factor acquired under\nrotation in order to produce full invariance. In this way,\nthe coefficients of the expansion Eq. (4) can be seen as\ndiscretized versions of the envelope function components.\nFor the electron and hole wave functions whose modulus square is depicted in Fig. 1 the lowest-lying levels\nare indeed invariant under the action of the elements\nof the discrete group and therefore represent s-states.\nAs expected, the electron s-state consists mainly of s\natomic orbitals, i. e. the dominant coefficient is \u03b1(R),\nwhich is C3v -invariant as stated above. This state looks\nvery similar to what would be expected for an s-state\nin the effective mass approximation: it is symmetric under rotation, has a single maximum at the center and\ndecays to the boundaries. In contrast, the shape of the\nground state of the holes does not show the same behavior. It shows the (discrete) rotational symmetry, but has\na node at the center. This state is expected to consist\nmainly of p atomic orbitals and indeed, an inspection of\nits coefficients shows that the second sum in Eq. (4) is\ndominant. Since Fig. 1 displays the sum of the modulus square of the expansion coefficients, one obtains\n\u2217\n2\n2|ZR\n\u03b2(R)|2 = 2(XR\n+ YR2 )|\u03b2(R)|2 , which explains both\nthe rotational symmetry and the vanishing value at the\norigin. In other words the unexpected node at the origin\nstems from the p-character of the coefficients.\nA similar analysis of the coefficients can be carried out\nfor the excited states (p-shell), and reveals that these\nstates have indeed the |\u03c6p\u00b1 i symmetry.\n\ndipole matrix elements edeh\nij with e in the x-y-plane are\nmuch larger than those with e in z-direction. Therefore\nwe consider\n\u221a here only the in-plane matrix elements with\ne = 1/ 2(1, 1, 0) and denote the corresponding dipolematrix elements by deh\nij . Furthermore the matrix eleeh\nments dpi pj , with i, j \u2208 {x, y} are more than one order\nof magnitude smaller than the other non-vanishing matrix elements. As a consequence, these contribution can\nsafely be neglected in the calculation of optical spectra,\nin which the absolute value of the dipole-matrix elements\nenters even quadratically. As explained below, it turns\nout that these results can be understood on symmetry\ngrounds.\nTo this end we consider the matrix elements hlz |x \u00b1\niy|lz\u2032 i, from which all the in-plane dipole matrix elements\ncan be deduced by linear combinations and are characterized by simple transformation properties. Here we denote\nthe states |lz i by the phase factor e\u2212ilz \u03b8 they pick up under a rotation around the z-axis of the angle \u03b8, that is,\nlz = 0 for the s-state and lz = \u00b11 for the p\u00b1 -states. Using the transformation properties of the wave functions\nand those of x \u00b1 iy under rotation, one can rewrite the\nmatrix elements as\n\u2032\n\nhlz |x \u00b1 iy|lz\u2032 i = ei(lz \u2212lz \u22131)\u03b8 hlz |x \u00b1 iy|lz\u2032 i.\n\nIn a C\u221ev group the angle \u03b8 is arbitrary and one would\nobtain the familiar result that the dipole matrix elements\n\u2032\ndeh\nlz ,l\u2032z can only be non-zero for lz \u2212 lz = \u00b11. In particular\neh\neh\none has dss = 0 = dpi ,pj with i, j \u2208 {\u00b11} and only deh\ns,pi\nand deh\npi ,s can be non-zero.\nIn case of the C3v symmetry the allowed values for the\nangle \u03b8 are only the integer multiples of 2\u03c0/3. Then one\nfinds the weaker result that the condition for non-zero\ndipole matrix elements is lz \u2212 lz\u2032 = \u00b11 modulo 3. This\nmeans that the discussed symmetry reduction opens adeh\nditional decay channels. One still has deh\nss = dp+ p+ =\neh\neh\neh\ndp\u2212 p\u2212 = 0 but, in addition to dp\u00b1 ,s , ds,p\u00b1 , now also the\neh\nmatrix elements deh\np+ p\u2212 and dp\u2212 p+ can be non-zero. Nevertheless, since the last two are vanishing in case of a\ncontinuous rotation symmetry, it is quite plausible that\nthey remain small even in the case of a three-fold axis.\nThis behavior is found by the numerical evaluation of the\ndipole matrix elements. In our example of the small QD\n2\n\u22124\n(\u00c5)2 , which is negligible\nwe find |deh\np+ p\u2212 | = 4.84 \u00d7 10\neh 2\nin comparison with |dsp\u00b1 | = 4.73 (\u00c5)2 .\nAs we will see in Section V these selection rules, and in\nparticular the vanishing dipole matrix element deh\nss , have\nvery important consequences for the optical properties of\nnitride QDs.\n\nD.\nC.\n\n(5)\n\nCoulomb matrix elements\n\nDipole-matrix elements\n\nThe numerical evaluation of the dipole-matrix elements shows that the non-zero values of the in-plane\n\nIt is possible to use the same kind of symmetry arguments for the calculation of the Coulomb matrix elements. Again we find that a three-fold symmetry axis\n\n\f6\nTABLE I: All nonzero electron-electron Coulomb matrix elements determined numerically from the TB-wave functions.\nThe index 0 denotes the s-state |\u03c6s i and \u00b1 denote the states\n|\u03c6p\u00b1 i.

Nevertheless, these additional matrix elements are rather\nsmall. If the entire system is rotated by an angle \u03b8 = 2\u03c0\n3 ,\neach single-particle wave function acquires a phase factor,\nwhile the distance |r \u2212 r\u2032 | is not affected by this rotation.\nTherefore we find for the interaction matrix elements:\nz\n\nz\n\nz\n\nz\n\nVijkl = ei(\u03bbi +\u03bbj \u2212\u03bbk \u2212\u03bbl )\u03b8 Vijkl\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nFrom this one can deduce that Vijkl must be zero if\n\u03bbzi + \u03bbzj \u2212 \u03bbzk \u2212 \u03bbzl 6= 0 modulo 3.

This gives rises to additional non-zero\nmatrix elements Vijkl . Examples for the electron-electron\nVijkl are given in Tab. I using here the (s,p+ ,p\u2212 ) representation. Clearly these additional matrix elements are\nrather small. This is in accordance with our expectation\nabout matrix elements that would altogether vanish in a\nsystem with a higher symmetry.\nSymmetry is also responsible for some Coulomb matrix\nelements having equal values. Such cases are grouped in\nTab. I between horizontal lines.\n\nIV.\n\nMANY BODY PROBLEM\nA.\n\nHamiltonian\n\nSo far we discussed only the single-particle properties.\nHowever, the investigation of optical properties is an inherent many-particle problem.

Here ei\u03c3 (e\u2020i\u03c3 ) are annihilation (creation) operators of electrons with spin \u03c3 in the\none-particle states |ii of energy \u03b5ei . The corresponding\noperators and single-particle energies for holes are hi\u03c3\n(h\u2020i\u03c3 ) and \u03b5hi , respectively. The electron-electron, holehole and electron-hole Coulomb interaction between the\ncharged carriers is included in HCoul . The Coulomb matrix elements Vij,kl are determined from the TB single\nparticle wave functions, as described in Sec. II C.\nB.\n\nConfiguration interaction (CI)\n\nIn a semiconductor QD the finite height of the confinement potential leads to a finite number of localized\nstates as well as to a continuum of energetically higher\ndelocalized states. If one considers only the energetically\nlowest single-particle states, the eigenvalue problem for\na given number of electrons and holes has a finite (albeit large) dimension and can be solved without further\napproximations.\nAs the Hamiltonian H conserves the total number of\nelectrons Ne and holes Nh , the Hamiltonian matrix falls\ninto subblocks with basis states corresponding to uncorrelated many-particle states of the form\nY \u2020 eY \u2020 h\n(hj )nj |0i ,\n(8)\n|\u03c6i =\n(ei )ni\ni\n\nj\n\nP\nwith\noccupancy numbers ne,h\n= 0, 1 and i nei = Ne ,\ni\nP the\nh\nj nj = Nh . In order to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the interacting problem, the Hamiltonian H,\nEq. (7), is expressed in terms of the uncorrelated basis\nstates |\u03c6i, Eq. (8). The resulting Hamiltonian matrix is\nthen diagonalized numerically. In this way one finds an\nexpansion of the interacting eigenstates for a given number of electrons and holes in terms of the uncorrelated\nbasis states of the system. These states can be used to\ncalculate, for example, the interband emission spectra\nbetween the interacting Coulomb correlated eigenstates\nof the QD system using Fermi's golden rule:\n2\u03c0 X\nI(\u03c9) =\n|h\u03c6f |Hd |\u03c6i i|2 \u03b4(Ei \u2212 Ef \u2212 ~\u03c9) .

A similar equation holds for the absorption\nspectrum. The Hamiltonian Hd describes the light matter interaction in dipole approximation\nX\nHd = \u2212e|E|\nhn|rep |mih\u2020n,\u03c3 e\u2020m,\u2212\u03c3 + h.c.,\n(10)\n\n0X \u2192 1X\n\n0\n\nn,m\n\nwith E being the electric field at the position of the QD,\nep is the polarization vector, and e is the elementary\ncharge. Furthermore the states |ni and |mi denote hole\nand electron single-particle states, respectively. Fermi's\ngolden rule, Eq. (9), implies that the optical field always\ncreates or destroys electron-hole pairs. Hence the initial\nand final states differ by exactly one electron-hole pair.\nFor the following discussion it is convenient to express the\ndipole Hamiltonian in terms of the interband polarization\noperator P according to Hd = \u2212e|E|(P + P \u2020 ).\nIf the analysis is restricted to s- and p-shells and the\neh\nsmall dipole matrix elements deh\np\u2212 p+ and dp+ p\u2212 are neglected, one can split P into Plow and Phigh according\nto:\n\u0011\nX\u0010\neh\u2217\nPhigh =\ndeh\nps ep+ ,\u03c3 hs,\u2212\u03c3 + dps ep\u2212 ,\u03c3 hs,\u2212\u03c3 ,\n\u03c3\n\nPlow\n\n\u0011\nX\u0010\neh\u2217\ndeh\n=\nsp es,\u03c3 hp+ ,\u2212\u03c3 + dsp es,\u03c3 hp\u2212 ,\u2212\u03c3 .\n\n(11)\n\n\u03c3\n\nThis is motivated by the fact that the single-particle energy separation for the electrons is larger than for the\nholes.\n\nV.\n\nOPTICAL PROPERTIES\n\nTo be able to distinguish between effects stemming\nfrom the symmetry group of the QD and those additionally introduced by the internal electric field, we will\nfirst present the results where the built-in field is artificially switched off. In a second step, we will discuss the\ninfluence of this field on the multi-exciton spectra.\n\nA.\n\nExcitonic and biexcitonic properties\n\nThe considered small QD confines only three bound\nelectron states (s- and p-shell) for each spin polarization.\nThese states enter the CI approach, together with the\nhole s- and p-shells, which are energetically well separated from the other localized states. The corresponding\nexcitonic absorption spectrum shows the two lines depicted in Fig. 2. Here we denote an electron-hole pair, in\nwhich the electron has mainly \u03b1 and the hole mainly \u03b2\ncharacter, as an \u03b1\u03b2-exciton with \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 {s, p}. We found\nin Section III C that in the nitride case the transitions\ndo not originate from 'diagonal' ss- and pp-excitons, as\none may expect, but from sp- and ps-excitons.

The high-energy side stems from a transition in which\nmainly the s-shell of the hole and the p-shell for the electrons\nis occupied. For the low-energy side the s-shell of the electrons\nand the p-shell of the holes yield the main contribution.\n\nof the large energy splitting between the s- and the pshell of the electrons, the ps-excitonic transition is well\nseparated from the sp transition. Without Coulomb interaction, these transitions can be found at the sum of\nthe single-particle energies \u01ebep + \u01ebhs and \u01ebes + \u01ebhp , respectively. For the absorption spectrum the unusual selection\nrules described in Sec. III C and the resulting \"skew\" excitons lead only to quantitative changes. Even if the optical spectra could be described in terms of diagonal excitons, one would still obtain two lines in the absorption\nspectrum22 , one from the s-shell and one involving the\np-shell carriers. However, for the emission spectrum the\nchanges are quite important. Most importantily the exciton and biexciton ground state for small InN/GaN QDs\nremain dark.32 This is the case because the excitonic and\nbiexcitonic ground states are dominated by those configurations where all the carriers are in their energetically\nlowest shell together with the fact that the dipole-matrix\nelement deh\nss involving these states vanishes.\nB.\n\nCI results for multi-exciton emission spectra\n\nOnly for more than two excitons the CI calculation\nprovides significant population of the electron and hole\np-shells. Then emission processes involving the 'skew'\nexcitons can take place. As mentioned above the lowand high-energy side of the spectrum can be attributed\nto processes where an s-electron or a p-electron is dominantly involved in the recombination process, respectively. A schematic representation of the level-structure\nand electron-hole pairs typically involved in high- and\nlow-energy transitions is depicted in Fig. 3.\nAn inspection of the emission-spectra reveals a blueshift as the number of excitons is increased. This is in\nstrong contrast to the results known from the InGaAs\nsystem13,57,58 but can be explained in terms of the diagonal Hamiltonian, discussed in the next section, and the\nfact that the envelopes for the electrons and holes differ\nstrongly.

The eigenvalues of this\napproximate Hamiltonian are then the non-selfconsistent\nHartree-Fock energies. This approximation has successfully been used to describe the dominant trends in multiexciton spectra in III-V systems.51,58\u201361\nIn a ground state emission spectrum, without Coulomb\ninteraction, one would observe one line at the high-energy\nside at \u01ebep +\u01ebhs and one at \u01ebes +\u01ebhp on the low-energy side for\nan initial filling from three to six excitons. With Coulomb\ninteraction, one observes instead of single lines clusters\nof peaks as shown in Fig. 4. These clusters blue-shift as\nthe number of excitons is increased. The approximate\nposition of the clusters can already be explained by considering only the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian\nmatrix, see Fig. 5.

In case of six excitons the two results practically\ncoincide. All data are calculated in the absence of the piezo\nelectric field.\n\nthe diagonal description provide the approximate position of the clusters calculated by the CI, see Fig. 5. In\nparticular the smaller shift of the 4X spectrum relative\nto the 3X spectrum as compared to the shifts involving\nmore excitons is well described in terms of the exchange\nmatrix elements present in the first line of Eq. (14). The\ncorresponding transition energies of the low-energy side\ncan be found by changing e \u2194 h in the equation above.\n\nWhile the central position of the clusters is well reproduced by the diagonal treatment, the different splitting\nwithin each cluster is not explained. A detailed analysis\nof the states involved in the different emission processes\nshows that a semi-analytic description of the spectrum is\npossible. Such a description will be given in the following\nsections.\n\nVI.\n\nSEMI-ANALYTIC DISCUSSION OF THE\nMULTI-EXCITON SPECTRA\n\nIn the past, optical multi exciton spectra for nitride\nQDs have only been discussed with selection rules carried over from the InGaAs system.27,29,31 Additionally,\nthe diagonal treatment, which is often suitable for the\ndescription of major trends in the InGaAs system51,58\u201361 ,\ncan in the present case reproduce only the overall position\nof the clusters, but is by no means sufficient to explain\nthe multiplets. Therefore we will discuss in the following\nthe different multi-exciton spectra of Fig. 4 in detail.\n\n3X \u2192 2X Emission spectrum\n\nThe ground state emission spectrum with an initial\nfilling of three excitons, is dominated by pairs of lines\non the high- and on the low-energy side, see Fig. 6. We\nwill analyze only the low-energy side, as the same line of\narguments can be carried out for the high-energy side.\nDue to the spin symmetry we can restrict ourselves\nto one of the two possible ground states, for which the\ndominant configuration (according to the CI calculation)\nis shown in Fig. 7. A linear combination of configuration\n|Ai and |Bi, enters the 3X-ground state with the same\namplitude but opposite sign. Nevertheless, one can restrict the discussion to either |Ai or |Bi, because they\nindividually produce the same spectrum and possible interference terms in the expansion of the coupling matrix\nelements appearing in Fermi's golden rule are zero.\nIn Fig. 8 configuration |Ai is shown together with the\n2X-configuration (in black) that can be reached via the\naction of Plow . Note that the latter is not an eigenstate\nof the Hamiltonian. Instead it will be mixed with other\nstates by Coulomb interaction. The predominant contribution to this mixture is shown in Fig. 8 in light grey.\nTogether these two states either form a spin triplet state\nfor the electrons and a spin singlet for the holes (ts) or\na singlet-singlet (ss) state. These ss and ts states are\nee\nsplit by the exchange Coulomb matrix element 2Xsp\nand\ncan both be observed in the spectrum. The oscillator\nstrengths of the corresponding transitions are equal since\nboth final states contain the bright 2X-exciton state with\nthe same probability amplitude. Along the same line one\nfinds for the high-energy side an approximate splitting\nPSfrag replacements\n|Ai\n\u2212\nPSfrag replacements\n|Ai\n\n|Bi\n\nFIG. 7: One of the two configurations dominating the threeexciton ground states with Sztot = 0.\n\n\fPSfrag replacements\n|Ai\n\n10\n\nP\n\nlow\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2192\n\nPSfrag replacements\n|Ai\nP\n\nlow\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2192\n\n\u00b1\n\nag replacements\n|Ai\nFIG. 8: One part of the dominant configuration of the 3Xground state characterized by Sze = + 12 and Szh = \u2212 12 , together with the 2X configuration (in black) that is created by\nremoving the sp-exciton via the action of Plow . Additionally\nthe most important dark configuration to which the bright\n2X-state couples via Coulomb interaction is shown in light\ngrey.\n\nhh\nof 2Xsp\nwhich is, however, considerably smaller. Both\nsplittings are in good agreement with the CI result and\nexplain the dominant peak structure in Fig. 6.

Due to this symmetry one\nwould expect the same number of lines on the high- and\non the low-energy side of the spectrum. This expectation\nis fulfilled for all but the 5X \u2192 4X transitions.\nBy combining the first four states |\u03c81,...,4 i in Fig. 11\none can form ss, st, ts and tt spin states. The last two\nstates |\u03c85,6 i in Fig. 11 allow the formation of an st and ss\nstate. While the electrons of the first four states always\noccupy both p+ and p\u2212 , they occupy only the p\u2212 state in\nthe last two configurations. Therefore one expects that\nthe energy of the ss state formed by the states \u03c81 to \u03c84\ndiffers from the energy of the eigenstate created by combining \u03c85 and \u03c86 . By the same token one expects two\ndifferent energies for the two possible st-states. Therefore six different energies can be expected. On the high\nenergy side of the spectrum four lines are clearly visible\nand another two may be identified on the left side of the\ncluster. For the low-energy side, however, only two lines\ncan be observed.\nTo obtain further insight, we construct the Hamiltonian matrix generated from the states {|\u03c8i i}6i=1 and\nblock-diagonalize it by transforming to spin-eigenstates.\nThis way one obtains four subblocks:\n!\n1\n\u22121\nt\nHts\n= \u2212 32 ,\nHss =\n, (15)\n2\nt 1\n\n3\nThe ground state emission spectrum of 4X looks sim(16)\nHst = \u22122t\u03031 \u2212 Hss ,\nHtt = \u22122t\u0303 \u2212 ,\n2\nilar to the 3X emission spectrum.

From these expression one can read off\ning quadruplet-doublet splitting, which determines the\nthat the st and tt spectrum is shifted by \u22122t\u0303 relative to\nenergy difference within the cluster, is larger than the\nthe ss and ts spectrum, respectively.\nsinglet-triplet splitting.

Because the eigenstate within the one-dimenstional subspaces of the tsand tt-states is not affected by a varied parameter t, the\noscillator strength does not depend on the value of t.\nIn contrast, the heights of the ss- and st-lines depend\nstrongly on t as the amplitude of the different states in\nthe linear combination varies with t.

In contrast to the intuitive picture in which\nfirst the states with lowest single-particle energy are occupied, a strong population of the hole s-shell for more\nthan one exciton is found. The ground states are therefore not given by those states with lowest non-interacting\nenergy. This is already confirmed by a calculation that\ncontains only the Hartree Coulomb terms and can qualitatively be explained as follows: The attraction between\nthe electron and hole being in their respective s-shells is\nstronger than the attraction in the case of s- and p-shell\ncarriers.\nTherefore it can compensate the higher singlefrag replacements\nparticle\nenergy\nof the hole in the s-shell. This leads\n0\nalready for the biexciton to an occupation of the hole\ns-shell. However, an additional promotion of the other\nhole is not favored in this case because the increase in\n\n6X \u2192 5X\n\n5X \u2192 4X\n4X \u2192 3X\n3X \u2192 2X\n2X \u2192 1X\n0.5\n\n0X \u2192 1X\n\n1X \u2192 0X\n\n0\n650\n\n750\n\n850\n\n950\n\n1050\n\nh\u0304\u03c9 / meV\n\n1150\n\n1250\n\n1350\n\nFIG. 17: (color online) Emission spectra for a larger quantum\ndot (d = 5.7 nm and h = 2.3 nm) with different number of\nexcitons and in the presence of the internal field. For the\nemission of each multi-exciton complex the high-energy side is\nshown in blue (solid lines), the low-energy side in red (dashed\nlines). Due to the reversed level structure for the holes a\nground state emission is observed for exciton and biexciton.\nAs initial states the ground states with Sztot = 0 are chosen.\n\nenergy due to the stronger repulsive interaction between\n\nthe holes in their s-shell is higher than the energy reduction due to the stronger attraction between s-electrons\nand s-holes. As a consequence, the s- and p-shell for\nthe holes are equally populated in the biexciton ground\nstate. Therefore the biexcitonic line has approximately\nthe same oscillator strength as the excitonic one.\nFrom three excitons on, the ground states are dominated by configurations in which both the s-shell for\nelectrons and the s-shell for holes are fully populated. As\na consequence, one obtains qualitatively the same spectra as in the case of the smaller dot with the 'normal'\norder of the shells. However, one finds that the oscillator\nstrengths are strongly reduced in the larger system and\nthat the Hartree shifts are even more pronounced, due to\nthe strong separation of electron and hole wave functions.\n\nIX.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this work we have investigated the electronic and optical properties of lens-shaped InN/GaN QDs. Employing a tight-binding model where the weak crystal-field\nsplitting and spin-orbit coupling for the system studied\nhere are neglected, we found an exactly degenerate singleparticle p-shell. This degeneracy originates from the C3v symmetry of the underlying wurtzite lattice. This result\nis in particular intriguing in view of recent discussions in\nthe literature about the p-shell degeneracy in zinc-blende\nQDs. Based on the microscopically determined singleparticle wave functions, the dipole and Coulomb matrix\nelements were evaluated. These matrix elements served\nas input parameters for configuration interaction calculations and allowed the determination and further analysis of optical properties. Our prediction of dark exciton\nand biexciton ground state for small dots is confirmed\nby symmetry considerations. In contrast to other III-V\nmaterial systems, the emission from nitride-based QDs is\ndominated by 'skew' excitons, so that completely different multi-exciton spectra arise. For larger QDs, we found\nthat the strong internal electric built-in field can reverse\nthe energetic order of the hole states, which results in\na bright exciton and biexciton ground state. However,\nthe oscillator strength is strongly reduced in these structures due to the quantum confined Stark effect. By restricting the analysis to the energetically lowest shells,\na semi-analytic description of the optical properties was\npossible, leading to a deeper insight into the origin of the\nvarious emission lines.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge financial support by the Deutsche\nForschungsgemeinschaft (research group \"Physics of\nnitride-based, nanostructured, light-emitting devices\")\nand a grant for CPU time from the NIC at the\nForschungszentrum J\u00fclich.\n\n\f14\n\n\u2217\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n15\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n30\n\nPresent address: College of Optical Sciences, University of\nArizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA\nP.
