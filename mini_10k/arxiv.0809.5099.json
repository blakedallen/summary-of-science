Introduction\nScaling of transistor dimensions as\ndescribed and dictated by Moore's law\nhas generated astonishing innovation\ncycles in silicon technology over the\nlast four decades [1][2]. As a result,\nCMOS technology today stands out as a\nfundamental technology that enables the\nglobal information society. Looking\ninto the future, silicon technology is\nexpected to remain the work horse for\nelectronic applications for at least\nfifteen more years, but innovations no\nlonger stem from pure geometrical\nscaling according to Moore's law.\nInstead, an era of material-based scaling\nhas emerged, where novel materials\nmust be introduced into the standard\nCMOS process to further reduce\nmanufacturing\ncost,\nimprove\nperformance and/or reduce leakage\npower.\n\n*\n\nFig. 1. Schematic of a graphene monolayer.\n\nCarbon-based electronics are considered\none of the most promising options to\nenhance silicon in the future [3]. A\nprominent\nexample\nare\ncarbon\nnanotubes (CNTs), which have received\nample attention due to their intriguing\nelectrical properties [4]. Nonetheless,\nthere are two major drawbacks\nassociated with CNTs. A lack of\nchirality control during production leads\nto a mixture of metallic and\nsemiconducting nanotubes. In addition,\n\ncorresponding author. Tel.: +49 241 8867 207; fax: +49 241 8867 571\nE-mail address: lemme@amo.de (M.C. Lemme)\n\n\fthere is no method currently available to\naccurately place hundreds of millions of\nnanotubes where they would be needed\nin order to form integrated circuits.\nUnless manufacturing processes are\nmastered and self-organization methods\nare employed, these could eventually\nprohibit their utilization as an addition\nto or replacement of silicon as a base\nmaterial.\nAnother prominent example are carbon\n\"substrates\", thin carbon layers with\nsimilar properties to CNTs. Such twodimensional single and few layer carbon\nsheets, referred to as graphene sheets,\nhave only very recently been\ndemonstrated to be thermodynamically\nstable [5]. A schematic of a graphene\nmonolayer sheet is shown in Fig. 1:\nhexagonal rings formed by sp2-bonded\ncarbon atoms are arranged in a dense\nhoneycomb structure. In this twodimensional form, graphene is a semimetal with an extremely small overlap\nbetween the valence and the conduction\nband (zero-gap material). In its threedimensional graphite form, graphene\nsheets are weakly coupled between the\nlayers with van der Waals forces.\nCarrier mobility values between 3000\nand 27000 cm2/Vs have been reported\nfor graphene and make it an extremely\npromising\nmaterial\nfor\nfuture\nnanoelectronic applications [5][6]. It is\nfurther known that carrier transport in\ngraphene takes place in the \u03c0-orbitals\nperpendicular to the surface [7].\nIntrinsically this translates into charge\ncarrier transport with a mean free path\nfor carriers of L = 400 nm at room\ntemperature [5]. This would make\nballistic devices feasible even at relaxed\nfeature sizes compared to State-of-theArt CMOS technology.\n\nPublished experimental data has been so\nfar mainly obtained from mono- or few\nlayer graphene on oxidized silicon\nwafers or decomposed intrinsic silicon\ncarbide [5][6]. In first experiments, the\nsurface of the graphene has been left\nuncovered\nand\npseudo-MOS\ncharacteristics have been obtained. This\nis in contrast to any device integration,\nwhere a gate insulator, an electrode and\nlow-k dielectrics need to be deposited\non top of the graphene. Only very\nrecently, first field effect devices with\ntop-gate structures have been reported\n[8][9][10].\nIn this work, the electron and hole\nmobilities of graphene are extracted\nfrom field effect transistors (graphene\nFETs) with a double gate structure,\nwhere the pseudo-MOS back-gate is\ncomplemented\nby\na\nsecond,\nlithographically defined sub-\u03bcm topgate. A schematic of such a device is\nshown in Fig. 2. Carrier transport in\nthese double-gated transistors is\ncompared to \"open\" graphene FETs\nwithout top-gate dielectric. The\nextracted values are compared to\nliterature data of silicon and ultra-thin\nbody silicon on insulator (SOI) devices.\n\nFig. 2. Schematic of a graphene FET.\n\n\f2. Experimental\nHigh-quality silicon dioxide (SiO2)\nfilms of tox = 300 nm have been\nthermally grown on boron doped silicon\nwafers (100) with a base doping\nconcentration of NA = 1015 cm-3. A\nmanual exfoliation process similar to\nthat described in [5] has been used to\ndeposit graphene on the oxidized\nwafers. Next, mono- and few layer\ngraphene flakes have been visually\nidentified with an optical microscope.\nLift-off processes have been used to\nstructure evaporated titanium (Ti) / gold\n(Au) source (S) and drain (D) contacts.\nAt this point, IV-measurements of the\npseudo-MOS structures have been\nobtained.\n\ne-beam defined top-gate transistor has a\ngate length of L = 650 nm.\nGraphene thickness has been measured\nby atomic force microscopy, shown in\nFig. 4. Here, the thickness of the\ngraphene flake ranges from tg = 0.8 nm\nto tg = 2 nm. This indicates that only a\nfew layers of graphene are present.\nG\ngraphene\n\nS\n1 \u03bcm\nFig. 4. Atomic force microscope image of a\ngraphene FET.\n\nFig. 3. Scanning electron microscope image of a\ngraphene FET.\n\nNext, electron beam lithography has\nbeen used to define top-gate electrodes.\nA gate stack of silicon dioxide gate\ndielectric (20 nm) and Ti (10 nm) / Au\n(100 nm) electrode has then been\ndeposited by electron beam evaporation.\nFinally, the gate stack has been\nstructured by a lift-off process. A\nscanning electron microscope image in\nFig. 3 shows an example of a graphene\nfield effect transistor. This particular\ngraphene flake has a total length from\nsource to drain of L = 5 \u03bcm and a width\nof W \u2248 650 nm under the top-gate. The\n\nFor a detailed analysis, Raman\nspectroscopy has been used to\ndistinguish\nbetween\nfewand\nmonolayer graphene [11][12]. For\ncomparison, the Raman-spectra of the\ngraphene flake (open rectangles) and a\nfew layer graphene sample (solid\ncircles) are depicted in Fig. 5. The\ngraphene monolayer is clearly identified\nby the shape and the position of the\nRaman spectrum [11].\n\nFig. 5. Raman spectra of graphene flakes with\ndifferent layer numbers.\n\n\fFig. 6. Graphene FET output characteristics\nwith and without top-gate dielectric at zero\ntransversal field.\n\nIn Fig. 7, back-gate or pseudo-MOS\ntransfer characteristics of a graphene\nFET before and after top-gate\nfabrication are shown. The source-drain\nvoltage has been kept constant at\nVds = 100 mV and the back-gate electric\nfield has been swept from Ebg = 3.5 MV/cm to Ebg = 3.5 MV/cm. The\ndrain current is modulated by almost\none order of magnitude without a topgate (Fig. 7, black dots). Similar to\nCNTs, ambipolar behavior is observed.\nIt is interesting to note that hole\nconduction is favored over electron\nconduction as negative back-gate fields\nresult in higher drain current\nmodulation compared to positive back-\n\n10.0\n\nVd = +100 mV\n\n2.5\n2.0\n\n7.5\n\nwith top-gate\n\n5.0\n\n1.5\n1.0\n\n2.5\n\nwithout top-gate\n\n0.5\n\ndrain current Id (\u03bcA)\n\nElectrical measurements have been\nperformed on this monolayer graphene\nfield-effect device prior and after topgate deposition.

Back-gate transfer characteristics of a\ngraphene FET with and without top-gate.\n\nAfter the deposition of the SiO2 topgate dielectric, the IV transfer\ncharacteristics maintain their basic\nsignature, but the current level and the\ncurrent modulation are decreased\ndramatically, represented by hollow\ncircles in Fig. 7. This translates to a\nreduced carrier mobility in double gated\ngraphene. This result seems to be in\ncontrast with other groups which have\nreported no significant effect of top gate\ndielectrics on DC transport properties.\nCarrier mobilities have been calculated\nusing a Drude model for carrier\ntransport. First, the charge carrier\ndensity ns in the graphene FET in Fig. 7\nhas been calculated using\nns = \u03b5ox*VG / (q*tox)\n\nwith the silicon dioxide permittivity \u03b5ox,\ngate voltage VG, electron charge q and\nsilicon dioxide thickness tox. The\neffective electric field in the graphene\nsheet has been calculated by using a\nvalue of \u03b5g = 2.4 for the dielectric\nconstant of graphene [14].\nFor the uncovered graphene, mobilities\nof \u03bch \u2265 4790 cm2/Vs for holes and\n\n\f\u03bce \u2265 4780 cm2/Vs for electrons at\neffective\nelectric\nfields\nof\nEeff = 0.4 MV/cm have been obtained\n[8].\nFig. 8 compares carrier mobilities in\ngraphene with and without a top-gate\nelectrode to the universal mobility of\nsilicon [15] and to experimental\nliterature data for ultra thin body SOI\ntransistors [16] over a range of effective\ntransversal electric field. A distinct\nmobility reduction after top-gate\ndeposition is observed that is attributed\nto the participation of the top \u03c0-orbitales\nto van der Waals bonds to the silicon\ndioxide. The resultant reduction of\norbital overlap then leads to a reduced\nconductivity [7].\nholes\n\n1000\n\nuncovered\ncovered\n\ncovered\nuniv.\n\nSi-UTB\n\n100\n\n2.2\n\nEbg (MV/cm)\n\n2.0\n\nId (\u03bcA)\n\nuncovered\n\nsilicon\n\nat\n\nroom\n\nThe top-gate transfer characteristics of a\ngraphene FET are shown in Fig. 9 for\nfour different back-gate fields Ebg. The\ndrain current Id is modulated by the topgate field Etg. The constant back-gate\nfield Ebg results in an offset of the topgate transfer characteristics and does\nnot change its ambipolar signature. The\ninfluence of the back-gate field is\ntherefore mainly attributed to a\nmodulation of the series resistance in\nthe source and drain leads of the\ngraphene FET.\n\nelectrons\n\n2\n\nmobility \u03bceff [cm /Vs]\n\n10000\n\nboth in (100)\ntemperature.\n\n-3.33\n-1.67\n-0.67\n0\n\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n\nuniv.\n\n1.2\n\n-1.0 -0.8 -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nEeff [MV/cm]\n\nFig. 8.

Conclusion\nDouble-gated graphene field effect\ntransistors are investigated in this work.\nIn addition to previously investigated\npseudo-MOS structures, a second gate\nis fabricated on top of graphene layers.\nIV-measurements show a reduction of\ndrain currents caused by decreased\ncarrier mobilities. Despite a poor\nquality top-gate oxide, however,\ngraphene mobility values still exceed\nthe universal mobility of silicon over\n\n\falmost the entire range investigated.\nFurthermore, graphene exceeds by far\nreported mobilities in UTB SOI\nMOSFETs. Even though band gap\nengineering has been theoretically\nproposed to improve graphene FET\noperation\n[19][20][21],\nthis\nexperimental work confirms the\npotential\nof\ngraphene\nas\na\nnanoelectronics material.\n\n5.
