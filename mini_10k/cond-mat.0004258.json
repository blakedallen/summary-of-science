The free energy functional is written down using a multilayer model in which c-domain layers of one ferroelectric material\nalternate with a-domain layers of a second ferroelectric material. We assume that the interfaces are\nperfectly sharp and that the polarization at these boundaries is zero. The renormalization of the\nfree energy coefficients due to the stresses in the films and to the depolarizing field was taken into\naccount, as well as the renormalization of the coefficients of the polarization gradients. The equilibrium inhomogeneous polarization temperature and its thickness dependence were determined from\nthe solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations resulting from the minimization of the free energy\nfunctional. A thickness induced ferroelectric phase transition is shown to exist and its transition\ntemperature and critical layer thickness depend on the domain orientation. The criteria for \"a/c\",\n\"c/c\" and \"a/a\" domain multilayering are calculated and expressed via coefficients of the free energy\ndensity and the layer thickness.\nThe differential equation to calculate the inhomogeneous dielectric susceptibility was found to be a\nLam\u00e9 equation. The calculated multilayer susceptibility diverges at the transition temperature of\nthe thickness induced ferroelectric phase. This divergence is shown to be the origin of the giant dielectric response observed in some multilayers. The theory gives an excellent fit to the temperature\ndependence of the giant susceptibility observed recently in multilayers of PbTiO3 -Pb1\u2212x Lax TiO3\n(x = 0.28). The equation determining the time and space dependence of the polarization is proposed and solved. The calculated dispersion law for the nonlinear polarization waves in multilayer\nstructures reveals a critical wave vector for a given layer thickness, or a critical layer thickness for\na given wave vector, for which the frequency \u03c9 = 0. The frequency of the polarization waves is also\nshown to increase with layer thickness.\nPACS numbers: 6865.+g, 7755.+f, 7784.-s\n\nparaelectric phase transition temperature [8], in superlattice growth [9], and in superlattice structural anomalies\n[10]. In the latter work, investigation of PbTiO3 /BaTiO3\n(PT/BT) multilayers with bilayer PT/BT thickness between 50Ao < \u039b < 360Ao [10] shows that \"c\"-domain BT\nlayers alternate with \"a\"-domain PT layers. This is in\ncontrast both to the \"c\"-domain structure exhibited by\nthin single PT films of the same thickness grown on the\nsame substrate. Raman spectra measurements reinforce\nthis x-ray determined orientational anomaly in addition\nto revealing the existence of a superlattice wavelength\ndependent mode, whose frequency increases with increasing \u039b. Up to now there have been few theoretical studies\nof ferroelectric multilayer structures. Calculation of the\ndielectric response has shown [11] that the spatial distribution of the layer thickness can lead to enhanced dielectric properties over a broad temperature range. A phenomenological theory has recently been developed [12] for\nthin film multilayers. The spontaneous polarization and\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nArtificial thin film multilayers composed of alternating layers of different materials have been the subject\nof study for many years. Much attention has been devoted to semiconducting [1], metallic [2], magnetic [3]\nand superconducting [4] multilayer structures. Increasingly frequent investigations of ferroelectric oxide multilayers are now taking place due to their technological promise: the artificial modification of structural and\nphysical properties for use in dielectric capacitors, memory systems, pyroelectric detection and other types of\ndevices makes them technologically attractive (see e.g.\n[5,6] and references therein), and there is also a basic interest in creating model structures for which to\nstudy fundamental questions related to ferroelectricity\non increasingly smaller length scales. Recent experiments have revealed many unusual properties, such as giant dielectric response [7], anomalies in the ferroelectric1\n\n\fwhere \u03a6A and \u03a6B are the free energy densities of the A\nlayers and the B layers respectively and \u03a6A,B is the free\nenergy density resulting from the interaction between the\nlayers.\nWe will start with the following forms for \u03a6A and \u03a6B ,\nwhich can be obtained from those free energies having\ncubic symmetry, and which allows for the symmetry lowering that is related to the nonequivalence of the z and\nthe x, y polarization components in the film due to the\ncontribution of the mechanical strains and to the depolarizing field. These effects are incorporated into the renormalized coefficients.\n\nthe dielectric susceptibility were calculated numerically\nwith parameters appropriate to PT/BT. They showed\nthat a thickness induced ferroelectric phase transition occurs only when the strength of the interfacial coupling is\nweak.\nIn this work we will consider a multilayer built up from\nalternating (100) and (001) ferroelectric thin films (such\nas PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 ) epitaxially grown in the cubic\nparaelectric phase onto a cubic (001) substrate. We use a\nthermodynamic approach to describe the static and dynamic multilayer properties. The static properties are\nconsidered in section II in which section IIA is devoted\nto the description of the free energy of a multilayer with\ncontributions coming from the internal stresses and the\ndepolarizing field. Calculations of the inhomogeneous polarization and the thickness induced ferroelectric phase\ntransition are performed in IIB. The criterion for the\npresence of \"a/c\", \"a/a\" or \"c/c\" layer structures in the\nsuperlattice is determined in IIC. The differential equation giving the static dielectric susceptibility of multilayers is considered in IID. The dynamic properties are\ntreated in Section III. In IIIA the differential equation\ngoverning the time and space dependence of the polarization is written down and solved, and in IIIB the dispersion law for nonlinear waves formed by the polarization in the multilayer is reported. In the Discussion we\nshow that the theory is in good agreement with the observed giant dielectric response in PLT/PT ferroelectric\nthin film multilayers [7] and in the Conclusion we discuss\nthe applicability of our results and their future development. The Appendices contain the detailed calculations\nof (1) the criteria for \"a/c\", \"a/a\" and \"c/c\" layer structure of the superlattice, (2) the solution of the differential\nequation for the inhomogeous dielectric susceptibility, (3)\nthe multilayer susceptibility, (4) the value of the susceptibility for the thick film ferroelectric phase and for the\nthin film paraelectric phase, and (5) the Curie-Weiss law\nin the vicinity of the thickness induced ferroelectric phase\ntransition.\n\n2\n2\n2\n4\n4\n\u03a6A = a3 PAz\n+ a1 (PAx\n+ PAy\n) + a11 (PAx\n+ PAy\n)+\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u2202PAz\n4\n2\n2\n2\n+a33 PAz\n+ a13 PAz\n(PAx\n+ PAy\n) + \u03b133\n+\n\u2202z\n\"\u0012\n#\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132\n\u2202PAx\n\u2202PAy\n+\u03b111\n+\n(2a)\n+\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\"\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132 #\n\u2202PAy\n\u2202PAx\n,\n+\n+\u03b144\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\n2\n2\n2\n4\n4\n\u03a6B = b3 PBz\n+ b1 (PBx\n+ PBy\n) + b11 (PBx\n+ PBy\n)+\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u2202PBz\n4\n2\n2\n2\n+b33 PBz\n+ b13 PBz\n(PBx\n+ PBy\n) + \u03b233\n+\n\u2202z\n#\n\"\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132\n\u2202PBy\n\u2202PBx\n+\n(2b)\n+\n+\u03b211\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\"\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132 #\n\u2202PBy\n\u2202PBx\n.\n+\n+\u03b244\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\nSince we wish to take into account the change of Px,y\nalong the z direction, we have incorporated the additional\ngradient terms \u2202Px,y /\u2202z into Eqs.(2).\nEquations (2a) and (2b) correspond to the general case\nin which the x,y, and z polarization components exist\nin both the A and in the B layers. Experimental data\nfor multilayers usually show that c-domain layers alternate with c-domain layers [9], but recent experimental\nresults on PbTiO3 /BaTiO3 multilayers have shown [10]\nthat c-domain BT layers alternate with a-domain PT\nlayers in the multilayer structure. In order to be able\nto treat this interesting latter case we will assume that\nthe A layers consist only of c-domains (i.e. PA = PAz ,\nPAx = PAy = 0) while the B layers consist only of adomains (i.e. PBx = PBy 6= 0, PBz = 0). The variation\nof the polarization in the A and B layers in the vicinity of\nthe z = 0 boundary is schematically depicted in Figure\n2 in which the natural boundary condition for this configuration is PAz (z = 0) = PBx (z = 0) = 0 . Since Fig.\n2 represents one modulation period of the superlattice,\nthis same boundary condition must be valid for all the\ninterfaces that make up the multilayer structure, namely\n\nII. STATIC PROPERTIES\nA. Free energy\n\nWe consider a multilayer (see Figure1) built up from\n\"A\" and \"B\" ferroelectric layers extending from z =\n\u2212L/2 to L/2. Each layer has thickness li (i = A, B)\nso that the total multilayer thickness is L = N (lA + lB )\nwhere \u039b = (lA + lB ) is the multilayer wavelength and\nN is the number of wavelengths in the superlattice. The\nfree energy of the multilayer system can be written as\n1\n\u03a6=\nL\n\nL/2\nZ\n\n(\u03a6A (z) + \u03a6B (z) + \u03a6A,B (z)) dz\n\n(1)\n\n\u2212L/2\n\n2\n\n\fPAz (zj ) = PBx (zj ) = 0,\n\n\u2202f\nd \u2202f\n=0\n\u2212\n\u2202\u03c3 dz \u2202\u03c3 \u2032\n\n(3)\n\nwith the corresponding boundary conditions for P , \u03c3, P \u2032 ,\n\u03c3 \u2032 . Note that Eqs. (7a) and (7b) can be written for all\ncomponents of Pi and \u03c3ij respectively.\nIn what follows we will calculate P (z) on the basis of\nEq.(7a) and \u03c3 from first term in Eq.(7b) because we will\nhere make the simplifying assumption that the interfacial stresses are homogeneous and so we will neglect the\nsecond term in Eq. (7b). For films, the coefficients of Eq.\n(2) are renormalized coefficients. The stresses as well as\nthe depolarizing field act on the coefficients of the free energy of cubic symmetry. In general the thickness of the\nsubstrate is much larger than that of the multilayer structure. Taking this into consideration for the equilibrium\ncondition of the mechanical forces, it can be shown [14]\nthat the stresses induced by upper layers in the underlying films are negligibly small. Thus the nonzero stresses\nare \u03c3xx = \u03c3yy and \u03c3xy = 0 while \u03c3zz = \u03c3xz = \u03c3yz = 0 because of the existence of the unstressed free surface on top\nof the multilayer. The renormalization of the free energy\ncoefficients ai , aij , (i, j, k - Voigt notation) of bulk cubic symmetry by these stresses was previously performed\n[15,16] for a single thin film on a cubic substrate. Using the results of [16] along with the depolarizing field\ncontribution, the coefficients a3 and a1 in Eq.(2a) can be\nwritten as :\n\nL\nL\n+ 2jlA,B ; zj = \u2212 + (2j + 1)lA,B ;\n2\n2\nj = 0, 1, 2...N \u2212 1.\n\nzj = \u2212\n\nThe superlattice periodicity also implies the following periodic polarization condition,\nPAz (z + j(lA + lB )) = PAz (z)\nPBx (z + j(lA + lB )) = PBx (z)\n\n(4)\n\nNote that even in the case of a \"c-domain/c-domain\" or\na \"a-domain/a-domain\" multilayer structure, zero polarization at the boundaries would be the most probable\nsince the situation at the interfaces is physically similar\nto that of domain boundaries in bulk ferroelectrics.\nWe will, in this work, neglect the interaction energy\nterm \u03a6AB due to the polarization interaction between\nthe layers since this interaction decays rapidly, and because of the boundary conditions, we will also neglect\nany surface energy contributions. Hence we can rewrite\nthe free energy density (2) equations as\nfA =\n\nfB =\n\n2\na3 PAz\n\n2\n2b1 PBx\n\n+\n\n+\n\n4\na33 PAz\n\n4\n2b11 PBx\n\n+ \u03b133\n\n\u0012\n\n+ 2\u03b244\n\ndPAz\ndz\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\ndPBx\ndz\n\n\u00132\n\n(5a)\n\na3 = a \u2212 X\n\n(5b)\n\nIn Eqs.(5) we have conserved what is most essential for\nthe analysis of thin film multilayers: the gradient terms\nwhich take into account the polarization change along\nthe z direction (see Fig.2). Thus, in our model, the free\nenergy density f (z) = fA (z) + fB (z) will replace \u03a6A (z) +\n\u03a6B (z) + \u03a6AB (z). The most important feature of the free\nenergy density of thin films is its dependence on z. In\nthe most general case both the polarization P and the\nmechanical stresses \u03c3 can be inhomogeneous so that their\ngradients P \u2032 and \u03c3 \u2032 should also be taken into account.\nBecause of this, the free energy \u03a6 is a functional of P ,\nP \u2032 , \u03c3, \u03c3 \u2032 , which we will write as:\n\n\u03a6(P, \u03c3) =\n\nL/2\nZ\n\nf (P (z), P \u2032 (z), \u03c3(z), \u03c3 \u2032 (z)) dz\n\n2\u03c0\n2QA\n12\n+\nA\nA\n\u03b5A\nS11 + S12\n\n(8a)\n\nA\nQA\n11 + Q12\nA + SA\nS11\n12\n\n(8b)\n\na1 = a \u2212 X\n\nA\nA\nA\nA\nHere a = aA\n0 (T \u2212 Tc0 ), Tc0 , Qij and Sij are respectively the coefficient of the free energy, the ferroelectric\nphase transition temperature, the electrostriction constants and the elastic modulus of the A material. The\nstrain X = X1 = X2 can be represented as\n\nX = Xmf + Xth + Xdis\n\n(8c)\n\nwhere Xmf = (b \u2212 a)/a, Xth = (\u03b1B \u2212 \u03b1A )(T \u2212 Tg ) and\nXdis are respectively the misfit, thermal and disorder induced strains. In these expressions, b and a are the cubic\nlattice constants, \u03b1A and \u03b1B are the thermal expansion\ncoefficients of the two materials in the cubic bulk phase\nand Tg is the growth temperature. We point out that\nthe relaxation processes related to misfit dislocations, domain structure appearance and impurity diffusion processes can decrease X, but full relaxation can only be\nachieved in bulk materials [17]. The last term in Eq.(8a)\noriginates from the depolarizing field Ed whose contribution equals to \u22121/2EdPAz with Ed = \u22124\u03c0PAz /\u03b5A for a\nfree standing film without electrodes (\u03b5A is the dielectric\n\n(6)\n\n\u2212L/2\n\nwhere, for the sake of clarity, we have omitted the vector\nand tensor component notation.\nThe equilibrium values of polarization and stresses or\nstrains must then satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equations\n[13]\nd \u2202f\n\u2202f\n=0\n\u2212\n\u2202P\ndz \u2202P \u2032\n\n(7b)\n\n(7a)\n3\n\n\fconstant of the A material [18]). The renormalized coefficients in Eq.(2b) can be simply obtained from Eqs.(8)\nby the substitution a3 \u2192 b3 , a1 \u2192 b1 and the index A \u2192\nB.\nThe renormalization of the transition temperature in\nthe layer follows from Eqs.(8) and its analog for the B\nlayer. For the A and B layers the transition temperatures\ncan be written as:\nA,B\nA,B\nTcz\n= Tc0\n+\n\nX A,B 2QA,B\n12\nA,B\nA,B\naA,B\n(S11\n+ S12\n)\n0\n\nA,B\nA,B\nTcx\n= Tc0\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n2\u03c0\naA,B\n\u03b5A,B\n0\n\nA,B\nX A,B (QA,B\n11 + Q12 )\nA,B\nA,B\naA,B\n(S11\n+ S12\n)\n0\n\n\u03b144\n\n(11)\n\nObviously, the same relations hold for the free energy\nand the \u03b2 coefficients of the B material. The parameters \u03b3, Sij , \u03b4ijk are material parameters. The coefficient\n\u03b144 is proportional to X, i.e. \u03b144 6= 0 in films having\nnonzero homogeneous strain X (8c). The coefficients \u03b4ijk\nare components of a sixth rank tensor which is the lowest\nrank (and so having the largest components) which will\nrelate the squared gradient terms and the components of\nthe stress tensor.\n\n(9a)\n\n(9b)\n\nwhere Tcz and Tcx are respectively the transition temperatures for the appearance of Pz 6= 0 (c-domain structure) and Px 6= 0 (a-domain structure). It is seen that\nthe depolarizing field contribution decreases the transition temperature of the c-domain layer whereas the influence of strain on this temperature depends on the signs\nof the electrostriction constants and whether the strains\nare tensile (X > 0) or compressive (X < 0) [15].\nWe have omitted terms to the sixth power and above in\nthe polarization, which is the correct procedure only for\nsecond order ferroelectric phase transitions. In general,\nbulk ferroelectric materials such as BaTiO3 and PbTiO3\nundergo first order phase transitions, but calculations on\nBaTiO3 and PbTiO3 thin films have shown [16] that the\nrenormalized coefficients of Pz4 and Px4 have positive values and thus the ferroelectric thin film transition is second order rather than first order. For this reason we\nconsider the free energy forms (2) and (5) to be those\nappropriate for multilayer films.\nTo the best of our knowledge there has been no consideration of how the stresses will renormalize the coefficients of the gradient terms in the free energy of cubic\nsymmetry.

This may open up the prospect of engineering\nnew multilayer materials constructed with several ferroelectric thin films (including superstructures consisting\nof several thin films in its unit cell) with a broad distribution of the transition temperature. This will result in\na distribution of the material properties and also in any\nanomalous behavior, which may then be exploitable for\ndevice applications.\n\n0\n\nis the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. The\nfunction \u03c6(k) is calculated numerically and the results\nare shown in Figure 6.

In the scale of dimensionless thickness lz the\nregion of slow increase corresponds to 5.5 \u2265 lz,x \u2265 3.5.

This\nchoice was motivated by the experimental results of Ref\n[10]. We will now look at the conditions for which this\n\n(35)\n\nB\nwhere the transition temperatures in the thick films Tcz,x\nB\nB\nare given by Eqs.(8). It is seen that for Tcx\n> Tcz\nthe\npreference is for a-domain orientation in the B layers (and\n\n6\n\n\fhence for a \"c/a\" domain multilayer). In comparing the\nformulas for Tcz and Tcx (Eqs. (9a) and (9b)), we see\nthat for tensile strain (X > 0) and for Q12 < 0 and\nQ11 + Q12 > 0, which is the case for many ferroelectrics\nwith the perovskite structure, Tcx will be higher than Tcz .\nHowever for compressive strain (X < 0) it is possible for\nTcx to be smaller or larger than Tcz depending on the\nB\nB\ndepolarizing field. Tcx\n> Tcz\ncan result from the depolarization field's negative contribution to Tcz . However,\nwhen the depolarization field can be neglected (e.g. a\nfilm with electrodes having high conductivity [18]) compressive strains will lead to Tcx < Tcz .\nWe point out that the criterion given by Eq.(35) corresponds to considering the film in the mean field approximation with homogeneous polarization P = P0 (see\nEq.(19)). It is the function \u03c6 which takes into account\nthe contribution of inhomogeneous polarization related\nto the gradients in the free energy. Thus for the general\ncase, one has to use criterion Eq.(32) for \"a/c\" domains\nin the multilayer structure, keeping in mind that the opposite condition (sign \">\" substituted for sign \"<\" in\nEq.(32)) implies the existence of a \"c/c\"-domain multilayer structure. The criterion for \"a/a\" domain coincides with Eq.(32) for the case when the A layers are\n\"a\"-domain. The criterion depends on the free energy\nparameters, the transition temperatures, and the ratio\nof the maximum polarization in a layer Pm to the thick\nfilm polarization P0 . The latter in turn depends on the\nfilm thickness, the coefficients of the gradient terms and\nthe free energy constants b3 , b1 . With the help of Fig.4 or\nusing the analytical formulas Eqs.(25) and (28b), Eq.(33)\ncan be rewritten in terms of a dimensionless layer thickness lBx,z which is presented as the second scale in Fig.6.\nBy keeping in mind the analytical form of lBx,z (Eq.29)\none can see that the criterion (Eq.32) depends on the\nfilm thickness and the temperature dependent free energy parameters. Knowledge of these parameters will\nmake it possible to calculate completely the criterion for\na multilayer domain structure for a given layer thickness.\n\nPAz + \u2206PAz where \u2206PAz << PAz .

When the polarization is\ninhomogeneous, it is wrong to suppose that the susceptibility in the ferroelectric phase can be found by conventional differentiation of the free energy, i.e. \u03c7\u22121\nzz =\n2\n2a3 +12a33 PAz\n(z) is incorrect because \u03c7zz obviously does\nnot satisfy Eq.(37a) in general.\nWe\nwill\nnow\ndiscuss\nthe solutions of Eq.(37a).

The\nt\nhomogeneous part of Eq.(37b) is known to be a Lam\u00e9\nequation [24]. The general solution of Eq.(37b) can be\nwritten as a sum of the fundamental solutions of the homogeneous equation plus the particular solution of the\n2\ninhomogeneous equation.

Their forms, properties and the relations between them are given in [19\u201321],\n[24,25]. The details of the derivation of Eq.(38) are given\nin Appendix 2. It is seen from Eq.(38) that the behaviour of \u03c7zz (\u03be3 ) depends on m3 , which is the polarization ratio (see Eq. (19)). This dependence is depicted\nin Fig.7a,b,c for two values of the susceptibility at the\ninterfaces: \u03c7s = 2\u03c7t and \u03c7s = 0. The most interesting general feature of \u03c7zz (\u03be3 ) is the appearance of peaks\nas m3 increases. The peaks become sharper and their\nmaxima tend towards the interfaces as m3 approaches\nunity, which is when the maximum polarization of the\nlayer equals the thick film polarization limit. In this limit\n\u03c7zz (\u03be3 ) tends to \u03c7t in the major portion of the film independent of the \u03c7s value, as it should in a thick film\n(\u03b133 \u2192 0, PAzm \u2192 PAz ). From this we see that the solution (38) gives the correct value in the thick film limit.\nFor the electric field applied perpendicular to the multilayer surface, the susceptibility \u03c7zz of the entire structure can be expressed as\n\n\u03c7xx\n\n1\n=\n2K(kBx )\n\n\u2212Lz /2+(2j+1)l\nz\nZ\n\ndz3\n\u03c7zz (z3 )\n\n2K(k\nZ Bx )\n\n\u03c7xx (\u03be1 )d\u03be1\n\n(39d)\n\n0\n\nSince the available experimental susceptibility data for\nmultilayers [7] corresponds to the case of the electric field\napplied along the x direction, we performed calculations\non the basis of Eq.(39d).

Eq.(40) gives the det\npendence of the susceptibility on the temperature, the\npolarization ratio, and the layer thickness via the relation\nof these quantities (see Fig.4). In the thick film limit as\nm1 \u2192 1, Eq.(40) gives \u03c7xx \u2192 \u03c7t (see Appendix 4), which\ncan also easily be obtained from Eq.(2b) (by neglecting\n2\n2\nthe gradient terms) as \u03c7\u22121\nxx = d \u03a6B /dPBx . The susceptibility \u03c7xx corresponds to the ferroelectric phase of the\nthin film multilayer, i.e. T \u2264 TclB , where TclB is the thickness induced ferroelectric phase transition temperature\ngiven by Eq.(30). At this temperature the polarization is\nzero at the second order phase transition, so that in the\nlimit of m1 \u2192 0 we obtain (see Appendix 4)\n\n\u03c7xx \u2192 (\u03c7S + 2\u03c7t )8/3\u03c0 2 m1 , T \u2192 TclB\n\n\u03c7xx (T ) \u2248\n\nsin(z3 + Lz /2 \u2212 2jlAz )(\u03c7s \u2212 \u03c70 )\nsin(Lz /2 \u2212 2jlAz )\n\n2\n\u03c0 2 aB\n0\n\nTclB\n\n1\ncB\n= B\n;\n\u2212T\nTcl \u2212 T\n\n\u03c7s = 0\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n\u0001;\nB \u2212T\nT\naB\n0\ncl\n\n1\n2+\u03b1\n\u0001;\n2\nB\nB\n\u03c0 a0 Tcl \u2212 T\n\u03b1\n\u03c7s = \u03b1\u03c7t = B B\n4a0 (Tcx \u2212 T )\n\n(44)\n\n\u03c7xx (T ) \u2248\n\n(45)\n\nDetails of these calculations are given in Appendix 5.\nNote that the C-W constant for \u03c7s = 0 is very close to\n\u22121\nthat of the thick film value, Ct = (4aB\n. It is seen from\n0 )\nFig.8a that Eq.(43) fits surprisingly well the temperature\ndependence given by Eq.(40) (see solid curve in Fig.8a)\nnot only in the vicinity of T = TclB but also for the entire\ntemperature region. Eq.(45) also gives a good fit after\nrenormalization of the \u03c71 value in Fig.8a. Eqs.(43) and\n(45) show that the susceptibility dependence on the film\nthickness is mainly defined by the thickness dependence\nof TclB . We point out that for \u03c7S = const 6= 0, CB is also\nthickness dependent (see Eq.(44)).\nWell into the paraelectric phase at T > TclA or T > TclB\nwhere there is zero spontaneous polarization, there will\nbe some small homogeneous polarization induced by the\nexternal electric field. In this case the free energy can be\nexpanded in a power series of the polarization, and the\nstatic dielectric susceptibility can be found, as usual, by:\n\n(41)\n\n(42)\n\nA\nA\nA\nwhere \u03c7\u22121\n0 = \u22122a0 (Tcz \u2212 Tcl ).\nAt the transition temperature T = TclA or TclB where\nlz,x = \u03c0 and Lz,x = 2N lz,x , one can see from Eq.(42)\nthat \u03c7zz (z) and \u03c7xx (z) become infinitely large because\nsin(N \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c0j) = 0. The divergence of the susceptibility\nat the temperature of the thickness induced phase transition is similary obtained for \u03c7zz and \u03c7xx after integration\nand summation of Eqs.(39a) and (39b). Therefore the divergence of the susceptibility \u03c7zz or \u03c7xx at the transition\ntemperature T = TclA or T = TclB is the characteristic feature of ferroelectric thin film multilayers. In Fig.8a we\ndisplay the temperature dependence of the susceptibility in the ferroelectric region T < TclB for the thickness\nlB = 2lB0 , (recall that lB0 is the thickness where TclB vanB\nishes) which corresponds to TclB /Tcx\n= 0.75 (see Eq.(30))\nand \u03c7s = 0. Since lB = lB0 gives TclB = 0 this ratio\nwill be smaller than 0.75 at lB0 < lB < 2lB0 and larger\nthan 0.75 at lB > 2lB0 . It appears possible to write the\ntemperature dependence given by Eq.(40) in the form of\na Curie-Weiss (C-W) law at T \u2192 TclB (m1 \u2192 0). We\nobtain from Eq.(41) the following approximate forms of\n\u03c7xx (T )for three different values of \u03c7s :\n\n\u03c7xx (T ) \u2243\n\n\u03b244\n2\n4\u03c7s 2 + 2\nlB\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c7s = const 6= 0\n\nHence we arrive at the divergence of the dielectric susceptibility for T = TclB , which corresponds to lBx = \u03c0. This\nsame result can be obtained directly by solving Eq.(37a)\nor its analog for \u03c7xx when PAz = 0 or PBx = 0. In particular, and keeping in mind that in the considered layer\nstructure any function should be periodic with the period of the structure 2l (here we simplify things slightly\nby letting lA = lB = l [7,8,10]), we obtain:\n\u03c7zz (z3 ) = \u03c70 +\n\n\u0012\n\n(40)\n\n\u03c7\u22121\nzz =\n\n\u22022\u03a6\n;\n\u2202Pz2\n\n\u03c7\u22121\nxx =\n\n\u22022\u03a6\n\u2202Px2\n\n(46)\n\nEq.(46) leads to conventional C-W laws for the susceptibilities in the paraelectric phase of thin films which supplement the susceptibility in the ferroelectric phases of\nthe \"A\" and \"B\" layers\n1\n;\ncA\n(T\n\u2212 TclA )\n0\n1\n= B\n;\nc0 (T \u2212 TclB )\n\n\u03c7zz =\n\nT \u2265 TclA\n\n(47)\n\n\u03c7xx\n\nT \u2265 TclB\n\n(48)\n\nwhich diverge at the transition temperatures TclA or TclB ,\nwhich can be considered as the Curie temperatures of\nthe thickness induced ferroelectric phase transition with\nthe characteristic dependence on the film thickness (see\nA\nFig.5). Note that for thick films, when TclA \u2192 Tc0\nand\nB\nA\nB\nTclB \u2192 Tc0\n(see Fig.5), the coefficients cA\n\u2192\na\nand\nc\n0\n0\n0 \u2192\naB\n,\nbut\nin\ngeneral\nc\nand\na\nare\ndifferent.\nUnfortunately\n0\n0\n0\nit is cumbersome to compare the values of cB in Eq.(43)\nwith those of cB\n0 in Eq.(48). For the sake of illustration\nwe depict in Fig.8b the \u03c7xx dependence for the entire\ntemperature region in supposing that cB = 1/(2cB\n0 ) and\n\n(43)\n\n9\n\n\fB\ncB = 2/cB\n0 . The divergence at T = Tcl is the most\nsignificant feature here.\nIt will be shown later, by comparison with the experimental data [7], that the giant dielectric response observed in some multilayers originates from the susceptibility anomaly related to thickness induced phase transition considered above. Of course the internal fields induced by misfit dislocations, growth imperfections and\nimpurities will smear out the dielectric response of the\nmultilayers and thus reduce infinity to a more realistic\nvalue.\nWe will now discuss the possibility of calculating the\nthin film susceptibility as the second derivative of the\nfree energy instead of solving the Lam\u00e9 equation. To do\nthis we assume that in the ferroelectric phase the role of\nthe second term in Eq.(37) will increase with increasing\npolarization, and so it should be possible to neglect the\ncontribution of the second derivative. In this case the sus2\nceptibility becomes \u03c7\u22121\nzz \u2248 2a3 + 12a33 PAz . Integration\nof this expression over the layer thickness (with PAz (z)\ngiven by Eq.(23)) and then summing over the layers leads\nto the following expression\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\nE(kAz )\n6\n1\n1\u2212\n(49)\n= 2a3 1 \u2212\n2\n\u03c7zz\n1 + kAz\nK(kAz )\n\nIII. DYNAMIC PROPERTIES\nA. Polarization\n\nTo consider the dynamic properties of a periodic spatial structure, we should add the time derivatives of the\npolarization to equations (12a) and (12b). This can be\ndone by the procedure suggested in [25,26]. This procedure permits the investigation of low frequency dynamics\nin ferroelectrics. Its essence is to expand the polarization\nin powers of frequency or the time derivative operator\nd/dt. The first order term gives, as usual, the decay of\nthe polarization, while the second order term provides an\n\"oscillatory response\" and contains the mass coefficient\n\u03bc.\nThe equations of motion can be written as\n\u03bcA\n\n\u2202PAz\n\u03b4FA\n\u2202 2 PAz\n+ \u03b3A\n=0\n+\n\u2202t2\n\u2202t\n\u03b4PAz\n\n(50a)\n\n\u03bcB\n\n\u2202PBx\n\u03b4FB\n\u2202 2 PBx\n+ \u03b3B\n=0\n+\n\u2202t2\n\u2202t\n\u03b4PBx\n\n(50b)\n\nThe free energy variation \u03b4F/\u03b4P in the Euler-Lagrange\nEqs.(12a) and (12b), yields the equations for PAz and\nPBx\n\nwhere kAz is given by Eq.(19).\nEquation (49) gives the correct expression for the susceptibility in the thick film paraelectric phase (kAz = 0,\nA\n\u03c7\u22121\nzz = 2a3 , T > Tc0 ) and in the thick film ferroelecA\ntric phase (kAz = 1, \u03c7\u22121\nzz = \u22124a3 , T < Tc0 ). However,\nproblems arise with this approximation for intermediate\n0\nvalues of kAz . For kAz < kAz\n= 0.674 we obtain a negative expression for \u03c7zz (including the region of thin film\nparaelectric phase T \u2265 TclA ) and a positive expression\n0\n0\nwhen 1 \u2265 kAz > kAz\nwith \u03c7zz diverging at kAz\n= 0.674\n0\n\u22121\n(kAz sends the expression (49) for \u03c7zz to zero). It is ob0\nvious that for kAz < kAz\nthe susceptibility must be calculated from the differential equation Eq.(37) instead of the\napproximation derived Eq.(49) since the latter leads to\nthe physically unreasonable negative susceptibility. The\n0\nvalidity of Eq.(49) in the region kAz\n< kAz \u2264 1 when\n1/\u03c7zz > 0 can be checked by a 1/\u03c7zz calculation on\nthe basis of the exact solution of Eq.(37). Thus we see\nthat Eq.(49) will be valid only in the thick film limit of\nkAz = 1. Therefore, for the majority of thin films and\nmultilayers, the dielectric susceptibility will be defined\nby Eq.(37) whereas the normally used free energy second\nderivative (see, e.g. [11]) is valid in the ferroelectric phase\nonly for thick films. We also point out that Eq.(37) will\nbe applicable to bulk ferroelectrics with inhomogeneous\npolarization, i.e. when there is a strong contribution of\nthe polarization gradient since the mean field approximation is no longer valid.\n\nP\n\n2\nzm\n\n/P\n\n2\nz0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n15\n\n10\n\nlz\n5\n\n0\n0,0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1,0\n\nk\n\nFIG. 4.

It also exhibits the peculiar dependence of the nonlinear wave frequency on its\namplitude via relation between l and kz,x (Eq.(59)), see\ne.g. [28].\nWe schematically plot the dispersion law in Fig.9a.\nFirst of all since \u03c9 2 > 0 we have some critical value\nk = kc = \u00b1\u03c0/l for which \u03c9 = 0 .\nOn the other hand for any specific value k = k0 there\nis a critical thickness lc = \u00b1\u03c0/k0 at which \u03c9 = 0 and\n\u03c9 6= 0 for l > lc only.

GIANT DIELECTRIC\nRESPONSE OF FERROELECTRIC THIN FILM\nMULTILAYERS.\n\n6\n\n4\n\nLet us begin with the comparison of the calculated and\nthe observed dielectric susceptibility. The susceptibility was recently measured [7] in superlattices consisting\nof ferroelectric PbTiO3 and paraelectric Pb1\u2212x Lax TiO3\n(x = 0.28 - PLT) grown on (100)-oriented SrTiO3 single\ncrystal substrates. Three superlattices of PT/PLT with\nmodulation wavelengths of 100 A\u25e6 (sample S-40), 400\nA\u25e6 (sample S-10), 2000 A\u25e6 (sample S-2) were studied. In\neach superlattice the PT and PLT layers were of equal\nthickness, and the total thickness was 4000 A\u25e6 . The authors observed a Debye-like frequency dispersion of the\nreal and imaginary parts of the dielectric susceptibility\n\u03b5xx for the samples S-10 and S-2 in which the value of the\nreal part of the dielectric susceptibility at low frequency\napproached 420000 and 350000 respectively at T \u2248 50o C.\nA significant increase in the susceptibility with tempera-\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nT\nTBcx\n\nFIG. 8. Temperature dependence of the dielectric suscepB\nB\ntibility in units of \u03c71 = 1/(aB\n0 Tcx ), for \u03c7S = 0 (a) at T \u2264 Tcl\nusing Eq.(40) (solid line) and Curie-Weiss law (dashed line)\nfor lB = 2lB0 and (b) in the entire temperature range using\nEq.(40) (T < TclB ) and Eq.(48) (T > TclB ) for different cB\n0 values and for lB = 2lB0 (solid line: 1/cB\n0 = 2cB ; dashed line:\nB\n1/cB\n0 = cB /2) and lB = 3lB0 (dot-dashed line : 1/c0 = 2cB ;\nB\ndotted line: 1/c0 = cB /2).\n\n13\n\n\fture was observed in sample S-10. We present this temperature dependence by the full circles in Fig.11, where\nthe solid line represents the C-W law given by Eq.(43)\nwith cB = 7 * 106 K, and TclB (S-10) = 533K. The independence of cB on layer thickness (see Eq.(43)) makes it\npossible to obtain the transition temperature for specimen S-2: TclB (S-2) = 575K. Taking the ratio of these\nTclB values and using Eq.(30) for S-10 and S-2 leads to\nthe critical thickness lB0 = 55Ao . This value is larger\nthan the layer thickness (lB = 50Ao ) in S-40 specimen,\nwhich is why no ferroelectric phase transition was observed for this multilayer. Thus the value reported for\nS-40, \u03b5\u2032xx \u2243 750 at T \u2248 50o C, represents the contribution from the paraelectric phases of both the PT and PLT\nlayers. This value is several orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the values measured in the ferroelectric phase for S10 and S-2. The contribution from the PT-layers in the\nparaelectric phase of the S-40 sample, where Tcl \u2248 0 (see\nEq.(30) at lB \u2248 lB0 ) can be written as \u03b5xx = 4\u03c0cBp /T ,\nwhere cBp = cB\n0 in accordance with Eq.(48). Keeping\nin mind that \u03b5\u2032xx (P T ) < 750, we can conclude that the\nC-W constant in Eq.(48) cBp < 2 * 104 . Therefore the\ndielectric susceptibility in the paraelectric phase of the\nthin film is much smaller than in the ferroelectric phase.\nThis is contrary to what is observed in bulk ferroelectrics.\nOn the other hand this gives support to the supposition\nthat the contribution of the permittivity from the PLT\nparaelectric phase to the giant value observed in S-10\nand S-2 is negligibly small in comparison with the contribution from the PT layers. Estimation of the transiB\ntion temperature for a thick layer, Tcx\n, with the help of\nEq.(30) and the values determined above for TclB leads\nB\n= 580K. This value is smaller than that for bulk\nto Tcx\nB\nPbTiO3 : Tc0\n= 763K. This would seem to favor compressive strain in the layer, i.e. X B < 0 in Eq.(9b) beB\nB\ncause QB\n11 + Q12 > 0 for PbTiO3 . Note, that the Tcl\nand cB values were obtained assuming the temperature\ndependence of the low frequency (1 kHz) dielectric permittivity is close to the static one. Calculation of the\n\u2032\u2032\nstatic susceptibility via the maximum value of \u03b5xx measured at T = 50o C [7] has shown that the low frequency\n\u2032\n\u03b5xx was in fact close to the static value.\n\n1\n0,5\n\n\u03c9/2k0\n\n2\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n-3\n2,5\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nThe model used for the calculations was a multilayer\nconsisting of alternating layers of two different ferroelectric materials for which the interfaces between the layers\nwere abrupt and the polarization at these interfaces was\ntaken to be zero. The interaction between the polarization in different layers was neglected because of the rapid\ndecay of this interaction with distance [18] and because\nof the zero polarization at the interfaces. The production of sharp interfaces in multilayer structures is now\npossible using the most recent oxide thin film deposition\ntechniques as has been demonstrated in [9]. Our independent layer model produces results that are in agreement\nwith published results [7,8,10] both for multilayers and\nfor single thin films. In addition, this model should also\nbe valid for bulk materials in which polarization gradients are present and thus rendering calculations in the\nmean field approximation meaningless.\nWe have shown that the inhomogeneous polarization\nin the multilayers is at the origin of the inhomogeneous\nstatic dielectric susceptibility. We have determined the\ndifferential equation for the susceptibility and, from its\nsolution, we show that the conventional way of calculating the susceptibility as the second derivative of the free\nenergy [11] is approximately valid only for thick films\nwith small polarization inhomogeneity. The results related to the consideration of renormalization of the free\nenergy coefficients by homogeneous stresses in the film,\nto the criteria of \"a/c\", \"c/c\" or \"a/a\" domains structure as well as to thickness induced ferroelectric phase\ntransition can be applied both to multilayers and, after\nsome transformations, to single thin films on substrates.\nSeveral results are valid mainly for ferroelectric thin film\nmultilayers. In particular, the results obtained for the\nnonlinear polarization waves and for the dispersion law\nexhibiting a critical wave vector or, equivalently, a criti-\n\n-2\n\n2,0\n\n8\n\nV.

Because of the technical difficulties in producing\nand studying ferroelectric thin film multilayers are more\ninvolved than for those of single films or bulk materials,\nexperimental results are still somewhat restricted to just\na few different series of superlattices. The theoretical calculations of multilayer structures performed in this work\nare quite complex even for the relatively simple independent layer model. This model corresponds fairly closely\nto that of [12] where, for the case of weak coupling at\nthe interfaces, they also find the most interesting physical phenomenon in the layers: a thickness induced ferroelectric phase transition. Our results are in agreement\nwith the numerical solutions in Ref. [12]. We are now\nextending our calculations to obtain the static and dynamic dielectric susceptibilities over a wide temperature\nregion, including the response of the ferroelectric phase\nfor different orientations of an external electric field. A\nmore general model should take into account the interfaces where gradients in the mechanical stress can appear.\nThus the calculations will increase in complexity since\nthe equilibrium stresses must then be calculated on the\nbasis of the entire Euler-Lagrange equation (7b) rather\nthan by the simple differentiation of the free energy with\nrespect to stress that we have used above. Nevertheless\neven with the increased computational complexity, further theoretical, as well as experimental, investigation of\nferroelectric multilayers, including those with finite interfaces and with more than two layers in a modulation\nperiod, would seem to be extremely desirable both for\nbasic science and potential applications.\n\n(A1.1b)\n\nWe determine the derivative to be:\ns\n1\nb3\ndPBz\n= PBzm \u2212\n2 cn(uz ) dn(uz )\ndz\n\u03b233 1 + kBz\n\nuz =\n\ns\n\n\u2212\n\n(A1.2)\n\nb3 z + L/2 \u2212 (2j + 1)lB\np\n2\n\u03b233\n1 + kBz\n\nwhere cn(u) and dn(u) are elliptic functions (see e.g.\n[19]).
