Some recent analyses of single-spin and azimuthal asymmetries in SIDIS and Drell-Yan\nprocesses, focusing in particular on Collins, Sivers and Boer-Mulders effects, are briefly reviewed.\nThe perspectives for future phenomenological studies are also outlined.\nKeywords: transverse spin, transverse momentum, SIDIS, Drell-Yan, asymmetries\nPACS: 13.88.+e, 12.38.-t\n\nINTRODUCTION\nTransverse spin and transverse momentum of quarks and/or hadrons correlate with each\nother in various ways, giving rise to a number of transverse-momentum dependent distributions (TMD's), some of which are leading-twist quantities. TMD's manifest themselves in single-spin and azimuthal asymmetries in partially inclusive hard processes [1].\nIn the last decade, semiinclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) experiments (HERMES, COMPASS, CLAS) have investigated these observables and shown that they are\nnon vanishing and relatively sizable.\n\nSTATE OF THE ART\nMost of the phenomenological work focuses on three distributions functions: the\n2\ntransversity distribution h1 (x), the Boer-Mulders function h\u22a5\n1 (x, kT ) (spin asymmetry\nof transversely polarized quarks inside an unpolarized target) and the Sivers function\n\u22a5 (x, k2 ) (azimuthal asymmetry of unpolarized quarks inside a transversely polarized\nf1T\nT\nnucleon). The first two combine in SIDIS with the Collins fragmentation function\nH1\u22a5 , which describes the fragmentation of transversely polarized quarks into an unpolarized hadron. The processes considered by present phenomenological analyses\nare: e p\u2191 \u2192 e\u2032 \u03c0 X (Collins and Sivers effects with different angular distributions),\ne p \u2192 e\u2032 \u03c0 X , p p \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212 X (Boer-Mulders effect), e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0 \u03c0 X (Collins effect).\nThe parton-model expressions of the SIDIS structure functions involving the three\nTMD's mentioned above are\n#\n\"\n\u0125 * ~\u03baT\nsin(\u03c6h +\u03c6S )\nCollins\nFUT\nh1 H1\u22a5\n(1)\n=C \u2212\nMh\n\n\fSivers\nBoer \u2212 Mulders\n\ncos 2\u03c6h\n\nFUU\n\n\"\n\n#\n\u0125 *~kT \u22a5\n=C \u2212\nf D1\nM 1T\n\"\n#\n2(\u0125 *~kT )(\u0125 * ~\u03baT ) \u2212~kT * ~\u03baT \u22a5 \u22a5\n=C \u2212\nh1 H1\nMMh\n\nsin(\u03c6 \u2212\u03c6 )\nFUT,T h S\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere ~kT (~\u03baT ) is the transverse momentum of the incoming (fragmenting) quark, the\napices indicate the azimuthal modulation (\u03c6h and \u03c6S being the azimuthal angles of the\nfinal hadron and of the target spin, respectively) and C is a convolution in the transverse\nmomentum space.\nTMD's are usually written as factorized functions of x and kT , and their transversemomentum dependence is often assumed to have a Gaussian form. A typical\nparametrization for the Sivers and the Boer-Mulders functions is\n2\n\u22a5\n\u03b1\n\u03b2 \u2212kT /hkT i\nf1 (x) ,\nf1T\n(x, kT2 ), h\u22a5\n1 (x, kT ) \u223c x (1 \u2212 x) e\n2\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere f1 (x) is the ordinary number density. Due to the kinematics of current experiments\nand to the structure of SIDIS observables, high-x tails and antiquark distributions are at\npresent largely unconstrained.\nA combined analysis of the SIDIS data on the Collins asymmetry from HERMES and\nCOMPASS, and of the e+ e\u2212 Belle data, was performed by Anselmino et al. [2, 3] and\nled to the first extraction of the u and d transversity distributions, which turned out to\nhave opposite signs, with |hd1 | smaller than |hu1 |.\nThe Sivers asymmetry has been measured by HERMES and COMPASS and phenomenologically studied in [4] and in [5]. The resulting Sivers functions for u and d\n\u22a5u < 0, f \u22a5d > 0).\nhave comparable magnitudes and opposite signs ( f1T\n1T\nThe cos 2\u03c6h asymmetry in unpolarized SIDIS at small transverse momentum provides\ninformation on the Boer-Mulders function. In [6] it was predicted that the \u03c0 \u2212 asymmetry\nshould be larger than the \u03c0 + asymmetry, as a consequence of the Boer-Mulders effect.\nThis prediction has been substantially confirmed by the experimental results. A fit to the\nHERMES [7] and COMPASS [8] preliminary data has been performed in [9]. It assumes\ncos 2\u03c6\nthat AUU h can be described by the leading-twist Boer-Mulders component and by the\nso-called Cahn term [10]\n\"\n#\n2\n2 \u2212 k2 )\n~\nM\n(2(\n\u0125\n*\nk\n)\nT\ncos 2\u03c6h\nT\nFUU,Cahn\n= 2C\nf 1 D1\n(5)\nQ\nM2\nwhich is however only part of the full twist-4 contribution, still unknown. As the\navailable data do not allow a complete determination of the x and kT dependence\nof h\u22a5\n1 , the Boer-Mulders functions are simply taken to be proportional to the Sivers\n\u22a5q\n\u22a5q\nfunctions of [4], h1 = \u03bbq f1T , and the parameters \u03bbq are obtained from the fit.

The comparison with the data is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe cos 2\u03c6 asymmetry has been measured also in unpolarized Drell-Yan (DY) production, where it is represented by the so-called \u03bd parameter.

The combined SIDIS and DY analysis allows determining both the magnitude\nand the sign of the quark and antiquark distributions.\n\nPERSPECTIVES\nIn spite of its important achievements, the phenomenology of TMD's is still in its\ninfancy. The mature stage will be represented by truly global analyses. These should: i)\nincorporate the exact evolution of TMD's; ii) take all perturbative and non-perturbative\neffects into account and fit simultaneously polarized and unpolarized cross sections; iii)\n\n\fuse datasets with larger statistics and wider kinematics. More SIDIS data are expected\nfrom JLab and from future facilities (EIC), but in the short-to-medium term the main\nimprovement will come from polarized DY measurements: COMPASS (\u03c0 \u00b1 p\u2191 ), PANDA\n( p\u0304p\u2191 ), PAX ( p\u0304\u2191 p\u2191 ), J-PARC, NICA, RHIC (p\u2191 p).
