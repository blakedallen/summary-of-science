Ruggenthaler and D.

It is found\nthat in exact-exchange approximation the time-dependent dipole shows Rabi-type oscillations of its\namplitude. However, the time-dependent density itself is not well described. These seemingly contradictory findings are analyzed. The Rabi-type oscillations are found to be essentially of classical\norigin. The incompatibility of time-dependent density functional theory with few-level approximations for the description of resonant dynamics is discussed.\nPACS numbers: 31.15.ee, 31.70.Hq\n\nLinear response time-dependent density functional theory is widely and successfully applied to calculate absorption spectra of atoms, molecules, and solids [1]. The predicted transitions between the groundstate and singly excited states are often remarkably accurate [2], even with\nsimple approximations to the exchange-correlation potential. In experiments, a resonant interaction between\na laser field and atoms or molecules is routinely used\nto, e.g., prepare the system in an excited state. The\ntime it takes to transfer the groundstate to an excited\nstate is half a Rabi period (\u03c0-pulse) and can (in simple cases) be calculated using a two-level approximation\n(TLA, see any text book on quantum optics, e.g., [3]).\nTime-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) beyond linear response is, in principle, capable of describing\nthe entire dynamics of the electron density n(r, t) exactly\nif the exact exchange-correlation potential were known\n[4]. With the increasing interest in real-time quantum\ndynamics of matter exposed to laser light TDDFT beyond linear response attracts more and more attention\n(see [1] and references therein).\nIn this Letter we analyze the resonant interaction\nof laser light with atoms from the TDDFT perspective. To that end we employ a numerically soluble onedimensional helium atom as a benchmark model for the\ncorresponding time-dependent Kohn-Sham (TDKS) calculations. We show that the TDKS dipole indeed displays Rabi-type oscillations which, however, are of classical origin, and that the density itself is not properly described in the exact exchange-only approximation. The\nincompatibility of a TLA with the TDKS equation in the\ncase of resonant interaction is also discussed.\nLet us first introduce the widely used one-dimensional\nmodel helium [5] in which both electrons move along the\nlaser polarization direction\n\u221a only.

The insert shows\na close-up of the transitions to singly excited states.\n\nthe electric field in dipole approximation E(t), T is\nthe kinetic energy, and Vee the electron-electron interaction.

The time-evolution\nis governed by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n(TDSE) i\u2202t \u03c8(xx\u2032 t) = H(t)\u03c8(xx\u2032 t). The groundstate energy in this system is E0 = \u22122.238, the first excited spinsinglet state is at E1\u2191\u2193 = \u22121.705.\nThe corresponding TDKS equation reads i\u2202t \u03c6(xt) =\n[\u2212(1/2)\u2202x2 + vKS (xt)]\u03c6(xt) with\nZ\n|\u03c6(x\u2032 t)|2 dx\u2032\n2\np\n+ E(t)x +\n(1)\nvKS (xt) = \u2212 \u221a\n2\n1+x\n1 + (x \u2212 x\u2032 )2\n\nin exact exchange-only approximation, the last term being the Hartree-exchange potential vHx .

A laser field\nof vector potential amplitude \u00c2 = 0.0125 was ramped\nup over two laser cycles and then held constant. The\nlaser frequency was tuned to the resonance \u03c9 = E1\u2191\u2193 \u2212 E0 ,\ni.e., \u03c9 = 0.533 for the TDSE, \u03c9 = 0.549 for the TDKS,\nand \u03c9 = 0.492 for the frozen KS calculation (all inferred from Fig. 1). The TDSE result shown in panel\n(a) displays Rabi oscillations of the envelope of frequency\n\u03a9 = \u00c2\u03c9\u03bc10 = 0.0075, as expected. At t = \u03c0/\u03a9 \u2243 420\nthe excited state is maximally populated and the envelope of the excursion is close to zero. At t = 2\u03c0/\u03a9 \u2243 840\nthe system is mostly in the groundstate again. A closer\ninspection of the TDSE result shows that because of ionization and transitions to other states the population of\nthe first excited state after half the Rabi period is only\n0.975 instead of unity. The population of the groundstate after a full Rabi cycle is 0.96. In the frozen KS\ncalculation [panel (c)] ionization and the population of\nother excited states are more pronounced. As a consequence, the excursion envelope does not go to zero at\nt = \u03c0/\u03a9 and the excursion amplitude is overestimated.\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\n(a) TDSE\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n\n(b) TDKS\n\n(c) frozen\n\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nTime (a.u.)\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Expectation values hxi vs time for a\nresonant excitation with \u00c2 = 0.0125 and (a) \u03c9 = 0.533 for\nthe TDSE, (b) \u03c9 = 0.549 for the TDKS, and (c) \u03c9 = 0.492\nfor the frozen KS calculation.\n0.5\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\nx,\n\n0.3\n\nx,\n\n10\n\n0.4\n\nn(x)/2 (a.u.)\n\n(TDHF) equation.

[6]. The result is shown in Fig. 1. The strongest peak\nis associated with the transition between the groundstate\nand the first excited singlet-state at \u03c9 = E1\u2191\u2193 \u2212E0 = 0.533,\nfollowed by transitions to higher excited states and the\nfirst continuum (indicated by the vertical arrow).

The signs of \u03c81 (xx\u2032 ) are indicated in\nthe right insert.\n\nThe TDKS calculation in panel (b) shows oscillations of\nthe right amplitude. The Rabi period one infers from\nthe envelope-oscillations is remarkably close to the exact result in (a). For non-resonant driving the amplitude\noscillations are absent, as they should.\nFigure 2b suggests that Rabi oscillations are well described within the TDKS system. If this were true the\nTDKS density should oscillate between the groundstate\ndensity and a density similar to the exact first excited\nstate density shown in Fig. 3. Unfortunately, this is not\nthe case. Examining the TDKS density at time t \u2243 350\nreveals that it does not assume the shape of the exact\nexcited state density of Fig. 3 but rather resembles the\ninitial density again! Hence, despite an erroneous TDKS\ndensity we observe the Rabi-like oscillations of Fig. 2b\nin its first moment, i.e., in the TDKS dipole. As for our\ntwo-electron system the exact KS orbital corresponding\np\nto the excited state density is given by \u03c61 (x) = n1 (x)/2\nand thus, according to Fig. 3, has no nodes, the exact\n\n\f3\n0.8\n\nExcursion amplitude (a.u.)\n\nKS orbital representing this excited state density must\nbe the groundstate of a KS potential vKS [n1 ]. Hence,\neven the exact KS potential will not lead to a population\ntransfer to an excited KS state but will \"guide\" the density towards the stationary, \"new\" groundstate density n1\nduring a \u03c0-pulse. The exact exchange-only approximation used in (1) above does not do this. Hence, correlation is needed to describe the density dynamics properly.\nWhether memory effects [8] are important in this context will be investigated in a forthcoming paper. Note\nthat the exact KS potential may be simply constructed\nby inversion for the case of the two-electron spin-singlet\nsystem studied here [9]. However, in order to actually\nidentify memory effects more involved methods are required, e.g., the approach proposed in Ref. [10].\nLet us now investigate the origin of the Rabi-like oscillations in the TDKS dipole of Fig. 2. Since it is not due to\nthe density-dynamics corresponding to population transfer there must be another explanation. In order to show\nthat the oscillations are classical in origin let the motion\nof the center of mass of the density being approximated\nby the dynamics of a point particle in an effective anharmonic potential v(x) = (\u03c9 2 /2)x2 + (\u03b1/3)x3 + (\u03b2/4)x4\nwith \u03b1 and \u03b2 some constants. The external driver is\nof the form E(t) = \u00ca cos[(\u03c9 + \u01eb)t], i.e., \u01eb is the detuning with respect to \u03c9, i.e., the frequency characterizing\nthe harmonic region of the potential around the origin.\nThe squared excursion amplitude B 2 (\u01eb) = [max x(t)]2\nfulfills a cubic equation [11]. As soon as a critical driver\nstrength is reached more than one real solution for B(\u01eb)\nexists, and a discontinuity develops. Figure 4 shows that\nthe amplitude of the TDKS dipole as a function of the\nlaser frequency displays exactly this feature. The classical Rabi-like oscillations can intuitively be understood\nas follows: while being in the harmonic region of the\npotential the particle is resonantly driven and thus the\nexcursion amplitude increases. However, with increasing\nexcursion amplitude the particle inevitably senses the anharmonicity of the potential. As a consequence the driver\nis not resonant anymore and the excursion amplitude decreases. Hence the Rabi-like oscillations of the excursion amplitude seen in our TDKS results are essentially\nof classical origin. Similar oscillations were observed in\nJosephson junctions [12].\nGoing back to our model helium where\nthe TLA applied to the interacting system,\n|\u03a8(t)i \u2243 a(t) exp(\u2212iE0 t)|\u03a80 i + b(t) exp(\u2212iE1 t)|\u03a81 i,\naccurately captures the resonant population transfer to an excited state, the density evolves in time\naccording n(xt) = |a(t)|2 n0 (x) + |b(t)|2 n1 (x) +\n2R{a\u2217 (t)b(t) exp(\u2212i\u03c9t)\u2206n(x)}.\nHere \u2206n(x)\n=\nP \u2020\n\u03c8\u0302\n(x)\n\u03c8\u0302\n(x)\nh\u03a80 |n\u0302(x)|\u03a81 i is real with n\u0302(x) =\n\u03c3\n\u03c3 \u03c3\nthe density operator in second quantization with spin\ndegrees of freedom \u03c3.\nCan we use this accurate,\ninteracting two-level density to construct a vHxc for\na corresponding two-level KS scheme?

However, even if one\nwere able to determine a(t) and b(t) from the noninteracting system alone (so that one has not to solve\nthe full interacting problem in the first place) such a\nTDKS treatment will lead to wrong predictions. Note\nthat with (3) and vext (xt) = v0 (x) + xE(t) the dipole\n \u0308\naccelerationR of an N particle system reads d(t)\n=\n\u2212N E(t) \u2212 dx n(xt)\u2202x v0 (x). Here the term depending\non \u2202x vHxc ([n]; xt) vanishes in accordance with the zeroforce theorem\nR [1, 14]. With n0 (x),R n1 (x) symmetric and\nv0 (x) even, dx n0 (x)\u2202x v0 (x) = dx n1 (x)\u2202x v0 (x) = 0\nresults, and thus\n \u0308 + cd(t) = \u2212N E(t),\nd(t)\n(5)\nR\nR\nwhere c = dx (\u2202x v0 (x))\u2206n(x)/ dx x\u2206n(x). Equation\n(5) describes a driven harmonic oscillator which [for ini \u0307\ntial conditions d(0) = d(0)\n= 0] does not exhibit oscillations of the excursion amplitude as a function of the\n\n\f4\ndriver amplitude, i.e., no Rabi-like oscillations. Hence,\ndespite using an accurate density as input not even the\ndipole is reproduced within such a two-level TDDFT.\nWhat went wrong? It turns out that the introduction of\na TLA into (3) leads to inconsistencies between Hilbert\nspaces and Hamiltonians. In order to illustrate this fact\nit is sufficient to consider the Heisenberg equation of motion for some general, time-independent operator \u00d4,\n\u2202t \u00d4H (t) = i[\u0124H (t), \u00d4H (t)]\n\u0010\n\u0011\n= i \u00db \u22121 (t)[\u0124(t), \u00d4]\u00db (t) ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u22121\nwith\n\u00d4H (t)\n=\n=\n\u0010\n\u0011\u00db (t)\u00d4 \u00db (t) and \u00db (t)\nRt \u2032\n\u2032\nT exp(\u2212i 0 dt \u0124(t ))\nthe time evolution opera-\n\ntor. Making use of (3) and introducing a TLA amounts\nto calculating the commutators in expressions like (6)\nin the full Hilbert space while the time evolution is\nperformed in a reduced Hilbert space, i.e., in our case in\na two-level subspace,\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni \u00db2\u22121 (t)[\u0124(t), \u00d4]\u00db2 (t)\n(7)\n\u0010\nn\n\u0011\no\n= i \u00db2\u22121 (t)1\u03022 \u0124(t)1\u0302\u00d4 \u2212 \u00d4 1\u0302\u0124(t) 1\u03022 \u00db2 (t) ,\n\nP\nP1\nwith 1\u0302 = \u0010 \u221e\nk=0 |\u03a8k ih\u03a8k |, 1\u03022 =\n\u0011k=0 |\u03a8k ih\u03a8k | and\nRt \u2032\n\u2032\n\u00db2 (t) = T exp(\u2212i 0 dt 1\u03022 \u0124(t )1\u03022 ) . Instead, for a\nconsistent TLA\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(8)\n\u2202t \u00db2\u22121 (t)\u00d4 \u00db2 (t)\n\u0010\n\u0011\nn\no\n= i \u00db2\u22121 (t)1\u03022 \u0124(t)1\u03022 \u00d4 \u2212 \u00d4 1\u03022 \u0124(t) 1\u03022 \u00db2 (t)\nholds, with a different commutator leading to a different equation of motion. In particular, the equation for\n\u2202t2 n(xt) is different from (3) if the Hamiltonian is restricted to a two-level subspace [15]. Obviously, our analysis not only applies to a TLA but to any finite-level\napproximation.\nSo far we tried to construct vHxc by applying a TLA\nto Eq. (4). On the other hand, by inversion [9] we\ncan determine the KS potential vKS generating exactly a\ngiven two-level density n(xt). The\nR associated dipole ac \u0308 = \u2212 dx n(xt)\u2202x vKS ([n]; xt).\nceleration then reads d(t)\nSubtracting from the KS potential the physical ex \u0308 +\nvHxc , and we obtain d(t)\nRternal potential defines\nR\n \u0308\ndx n(xt)\u2202\nR x v0 (x) + dx n(xt)\u2202x vHxc ([n]; xt) = d(t) +\ncd(t) + dx n(xt)\u2202x vHxc ([n]; xt) = \u2212N E(t). By construction, the two-level density leads to the correct\ntwo-level dipole acceleration. This can only be possible if the term depending on vHxc contributes. Otherwise the same problem as with Eq. (5) discussed\nabove\narises. However, a nonvanishing contribution from\nR\ndx n(xt)\u2202x vHxc ([n]; xt) is only possible if vHxc does not\ndescribe internal forces only and thus violates the zeroforce theorem [1, 14]. As a consequence, the external potentials of the interacting and the noninteracting system\n\ncannot be kept equal. In fact, there is no local external\npotential vext (x) that supports just two levels. Nevertheless, a vHxc , which violates the zero-force theorem, may\nbe acceptable as an approximation.\nIn conclusion, we investigated resonant dynamics in\nthe exact-exchange approximation for the simple but\nnumerically exactly solvable case of a one-dimensional\nmodel helium atom. Although the dipole shows Rabitype oscillations the density-dynamics of the population transfer process is not properly described. As\na consequence, the dipole spectra calculated using exact exchange-only TDDFT may be sufficiently accurate\nwhile the real-time dynamics of the density is erroneous.\nThe incompatibility of few-level approximations with\nTDDFT to describe resonant density-dynamics was analyzed. Since there is an increasing interest in strongly\ndriven real-time quantum dynamics of matter the development of exchange-correlation potentials capable of describing resonant charge transfer is particularly important and will be the subject of future work.\nThis work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.\n\n[1] M.
