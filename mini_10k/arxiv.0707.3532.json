We provide an upper bound of the Hausdorff\ndimension of such a measure if it is ergodic. We also prove that it is\nergodic iff the related skew product is.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction and statement of a result\n\nIn this note we give a contribution to the study of the multifractal properties\nof measures which are invariant for iterated function systems. Recently this\naspect of such measures has been widely investigated, e.g. some results concerning their Hausdorff dimension were obtained in [S], [MS], [NSB], [JO],\n[R] and [FST]. For instance, in [S] and [MS], the systems contracting on\naverage and having Dini-continuous, separated from zero probabilities were\nconsidered and the upper bound of the Hausdorff dimension of the unique\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 28A78, 28D99.\n\n1\n\n\f(in this case) invariant distribution was given. A certain class of contracting on average systems with constant probabilities was dealt with in [FST].\n(Note that \"contracting on average\" has different meanings in [FST] and in\n[S], [MS].) The system of that kind could have more than one probability\ninvariant measure, however, in [FST] the upper estimation of the Hausdorff\ndimension of any of them was provided. It seems that it was the first attempt to study iterated function systems without uniqueness of invariant\ndistributions in this respect. Another such attempt was made in [JO], where\nthe exact dimension of ergodic invariant measures was calculated for a system which acts on a compact interval, is non-overlapping and has continuous\nprobabilities.\nHere we would like to continue the line of research which we described\nabove. Assume that (X, \u033a) is a separable metric space and {X, Si , pi }, i \u2208 I is\na finite iterated function system with positive probabilities and with ergodic\ninvariant measure \u03bc. Given N \u2208 N, denote\nZ\nX\nhN (\u03bc, \u03b4) = \u2212\npi1 ...iN (x)\ninf\nlog pi1 ...iN (y) \u03bc(dx)\ny\u2208BN (x,i1 ...iN ,\u03b4)\n\nN\nX i1 ...iN \u2208I\n\nwhere BN (x, i1 . . . iN , \u03b4) is the set of all points y \u2208 X such that for all n \u2208\n[0, N]\n\u033a(Sin \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 Si1 (y), Sin \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 Si1 (x)) < \u03b4\nholds. We will denote\nhN (\u03bc) = lim hN (\u03bc, \u03b4)\n\u03b4\u05810\n\nand\n\n1\nhN (\u03bc)\nN \u2192\u221e N\n\nh(\u03bc) = lim\nSimilarly, let\nZ\nX\n\u03bbN (\u03bc, \u03b4) =\n\nN\nX i1 ...iN \u2208I\n\npi1 ...iN (x)\n\nsup\n\nlog\n\ny\u2208BN (x,i1 ...iN ,\u03b4)\ny6=x\n\n\u033a(SiN \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 Si1 (x), SiN \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 Si1 (y))\n\u03bc(dx)\n\u033a(x, y)\n\n\u03bbN (\u03bc) = lim \u03bbN (\u03bc, \u03b4)\n\u03b4\u05810\n\nand\n\n1\n\u03bbN (\u03bc)\nN \u2192\u221e N\n(and we accept \u2212\u221e as value of \u03bb(\u03bc)). As we will see, hN (\u03bc, \u03b4) and \u03bbN (\u03bc, \u03b4)\nare monotone with respect to \u03b4 and subadditive with respect to N, hence for\nh(\u03bc) and \u03bb(\u03bc) to exist it is enough to check that h1 (\u03bc, \u03b4) and \u03bb1 (\u03bc, \u03b4) exist\nfor some \u03b4 > 0. Our main result is as follows.\n\u03bb(\u03bc) = lim\n\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1. Under the assumptions as above,\ndimH (\u03bc) \u2264 \u2212\n\nh(\u03bc)\n,\n\u03bb(\u03bc)\n\n(1.1)\n\nprovided the right-hand side is well defined and nonnegative.\nWe would like to emphasize that the assumptions of the above theorem are\nweaker than the ones that usually appear in the context of place-dependent\niterated function systems. Even the existence of invariant measures is not\nassured here \u2013 it must be guaranteed by additional assumptions. However, it\nseems desirable to strengthen Theorem 1 so that the field of its applicability\nwould contain the systems with probabilities positive only on certain parts\nof the space, recently considered by I. Werner (see e.g. [We]).\nNote that both h(\u03bc) and \u03bb(\u03bc) are well known in the case of continuous\nmaps Si and continuous probabilities pi : h(\u03bc) is the Kolmogorov-Sinai metric\nentropy of \u03bc and \u03bb(\u03bc) is the greatest Lyapunov exponent of the system\n(with respect to the measure \u03bc). In such a situation, the formula (1.1) is a\ngeneralization of the well known Hofbauer-Raith formula: ratio of entropy\nto the Lyapunov exponent.\nTo satisfy the assumptions of the above theorem, the system must have\n\u03bbN (\u03bc) negative or equal \u2212\u221e for some N (for otherwise the denominator\nlimit would be from [0+ , \u221e] and the whole formula would be negative). This\nproperty, crucial for the proof, could be seen as a weak form of contractibility\non average.\nLet us present here an example of application of our result.\nExample 2. Let S1 (x) = x/3 and S2 (x) = (x + 2)/3, both maps acting on\nX = [0, 1]. Let A \u2282 [0, 1] be a set with (at most) countable boundary and\nlet p \u2208 (0, 1/2). Set p1 (x) = p for x \u2208 A and p1 (x) = 1 \u2212 p otherwise. Set\np2 = 1 \u2212 p1 . This iterated function system has at least one ergodic invariant\nmeasure and every its ergodic invariant measure \u03bc satisfies\ndimH (\u03bc) \u2264 \u2212\n\np log p + (1 \u2212 p) log(1 \u2212 p)\nlog 3\n\n(1.2)\n\nThe paper is divided as follows. In the second section we introduce the\nnotation and give introductory information about iterated function systems\nand Markov operators. We finish the section with discussion of Example 2.\nWe also give there an important result on the relationship between ergodicity of iterated function systems and ergodicity of the corresponding skew\nproduct. This allows us to finish the proof of our main result, which we give\nin the third section.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nLet (X, \u033a) be a fixed nonempty separable metric space and let I be a finite\nset of cardinality at least 2. The following notation will be used through this\npaper. The set of natural numbers will not contain 0, i.e. N = {1, . . .}. To\ncount elements of covers of X, which are needed to estimate the Hausdorff\ndimension of a measure, we use the space \u03a3 = I N . We endow it with the\nproduct topology of I taken with the discrete metric. For a sequence \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a3,\nthe n-th term of \u03c9 is denoted by \u03c9n , whereas by \u03c9 n \u2013 the concatenation of\nthe first n terms of \u03c9 (i.e. a finite sequence (\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9n ) \u2208 I n ). Such an\n\u03c9 n determines the cylinder C\u03c9n = {\u03be \u2208 \u03a3 : \u03be n = \u03c9 n }. We denote by \u03c3 the\nleft shift map acting on \u03a3, i.e. a map such that (\u03c3\u03c9)n = \u03c9n+1. Finally, |E|\nstands for the diameter of E \u2282 X, whereas B(x, r) denotes the closed ball\nin X with center at x and radius r > 0.\nSuppose we are given Borel measurable maps Si : X \u2192\nP X, i \u2208 I, and\nBorel measurable functions pi : X \u2192 [0, 1], i \u2208 I, such that I pi \u2261 1. Then\nwe call the triple {X, Si , pi } a (measurable) iterated function system. The\nfunctions pi are called probabilities.\nIterated function systems are usually studied by means of the corresponding Markov chains. Generally, if we want to define a discrete-time\nMarkov chain, we can start with fixing a transition probability function (t.p.f.)\nP : X \u00d7 B(X) \u2192 [0, 1], i.e. a function such that P (x, *) is a probability measure for each x \u2208 X and P (*, A) is a Borel measurable function for each\nA \u2208 B(X) (by B(Y ) we denote the family of all Borel subsets of a metric\nspace Y ). For example, for a given iterated function system {X, Si , pi }, let\nus consider the function\nX\nP : X \u00d7 B(X) \u220b (x, A) 7\u2192\npi (x)1A (Si (x)).\nI\n\nClearly it is a t.p.f. \u2013 we say that it corresponds to {X, Si , pi }.\nHaving given a t.p.f. P , we can look at it \"dynamically\": to a fixed x \u2208 X\nwe assign another point, choosing it randomly \u2013 according to the distribution\nP (x, *). To better understand this action, it is convenient to think not about\nindividual points, but about their distributions. This leads to the definition\nof a Markov operator corresponding to P , acting on the set M of all finite\nBorel measures on X via the formula\nZ\n\u03bcP (A) =\nP (x, A) \u03bc(dx) for A \u2208 B(X), \u03bc \u2208 M.\nX\n\nThis operator transforms the set M1 = {\u03bc \u2208 M : k\u03bck = 1} of distributions\ninto itself (k * k denotes here the total variation norm).\n4\n\n\fIf the action defined above has no influence on a measure \u03bc \u2208 M, i.e. if\n\u03bcP = \u03bc, then \u03bc is said to be invariant under P . If additionally \u03bc \u2208 M1 is\nan extremal point (in M) of the set of distributions invariant under P then\nit is called ergodic. Later we use a convenient characterization of ergodic\nmeasures in terms of invariant sets \u2013 we call a set A \u2208 B(X) \u03bc-invariant\nprovided P (*, A) = 1A \u03bc-a.e., where \u03bc is a given invariant measure.\nLet us now come back to the situation when P corresponds\nto an itP\nerated function\nI Si\u2217 (pi \u03bc), where\nR system {X, Si , pi }. Obviously \u03bcP =\nT\u2217 (f \u03bd)(A) = f * 1A \u25e6 T d\u03bd for \u03bd \u2208 M, f \u2208 B, A \u2208 B(X) and T : X \u2192 X\nis a Borel measurable map. (By B we denote the space of all bounded Borel\nmeasurable functions on X.) We will say that a measure is ergodic or a measure/a set is invariant under {X, Si , pi } if P has the appropriate property.\nNow we assume that {X, Si , pi } is the iterated function system with an\ninvariant measure \u03bc. We are going to construct a measure-preserving transformation which corresponds to the initial system and has similar properties.\nFor any x \u2208 X, \u03c9 n \u2208 I n , let\np\u03c9n (x) = p\u03c91 (x) * p\u03c92 (S\u03c91 (x)) * . . . * p\u03c9n (S\u03c9n\u22121 (x))\nand\nS\u03c9 n = S\u03c9 n \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 S\u03c9 1\n(we also put S\u03c90 \u2261 S\u03c90 \u2261 idX , p\u03c90 \u2261 1, treating \u03c90 as an empty sequence).\nMoreover let px be a family of probability measures on \u03a3, defined on cylinders\nin the following way\npx (C\u03c9n ) = p\u03c9n (x)\n\nfor \u03c9 n \u2208 I n , x \u2208 X.\n\nMeasures px can be, in turn, used to define the probability measure \u03bd on\nX \u00d7 \u03a3 by the formula\n\u03bd(d(x, \u03c9)) = px (d\u03c9)\u03bc(dx).\n\n(2.1)\n\nThis last measure, \u03bd, is invariant under the skew product S acting on X \u00d7 \u03a3\nas follows\nS : (x, \u03c9) 7\u2192 (S\u03c91 (x), \u03c3\u03c9).\nIt is clear that the properties of the aforementioned invariant measures are\nrelated. Later we show equivalence of their ergodicity \u2013 to do this we need\nsome simple though useful facts.\nLet us fix a t.p.f. P .\n\n5\n\n\fLemma 3. Assume that \u03bc, \u03bc1 \u2208 M1 are invariant under P , \u03bc1 \u226a \u03bc and the\nfollowing condition holds\n\u03bc(A) = 0 or \u03bc(A) = 1 for any A \u2208 B(X) \u03bc-invariant under P .\n\n(2.2)\n\nThen \u03bc1 = \u03bc.\nProof. Suppose the lemma is false and set \u03c4 = \u03bc \u2212 \u03bc1 6= 0. The minimum property of the Jordan decomposition \u03c4 = \u03c4 + \u2212 \u03c4 \u2212 into nonnegative measures \u03c4 + , \u03c4 \u2212 implies that \u03c4 + \u2264 \u03c4 + P and \u03c4 \u2212 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2212 P . Hence and\nbecause P preserves the total variation norm, the measures \u03c4 + , \u03c4 \u2212 are invariant under P . Moreover, according to the Hahn decomposition theorem, there exist disjoint sets X + , X \u2212 \u2208 B(X), X + \u222a X \u2212 = X, on which\n+\nthe measures \u03c4 + , \u03c4 \u2212 (respectively) are concentrated. Now put\nT X0 = X ,\nXm = {x \u2208 Xm\u22121 : P 1Xm\u22121 (x) = 1} for m \u2208 N and A = m Xm . It is\neasy to see that 1A \u2264 P (*, A) \u2013 therefore A is \u03bc-invariant. Furthermore,\n\u03c4 + (X) = \u03c4 (X + ), \u03c4 \u2212 (X) = \u2212\u03c4 (X \u2212 ). As \u03c4 6= 0, both these numbers are\npositive and so are \u03bc(A), \u03bc(X \\ A) \u2013 the latter is true since \u03bc1 \u226a \u03bc. This\ncontradicts (2.2).\nCorollary 4. If \u03bc \u2208 M1 is invariant under P , then \u03bc is ergodic iff the\ncondition (2.2) holds.\nProof. Sufficiency of (2.2) follows from Lemma 3 whereas necessity is implied\nby Lemma 1 from [E].\nAssume now that {X, Si , pi } is an iterated function system with an invariant distribution \u03bc and the distribution \u03bd is defined by (2.1).\nLemma 5. The measure \u03bc is ergodic w.r.t. {Si , pi , X} iff the measure \u03bd is\nergodic for (X \u00d7 \u03a3, S).\nProof. By Corollary 4 it suffices to prove that \u03bc satisfies (2.2) iff \u03bd is ergodic.\nSufficiency is obvious, so we turn to necessity. Suppose \u03bd is not ergodic, i.e.\nthere exists a set D \u2208 B(X \u00d7 \u03a3) which is S-invariant and such that\n\u03bd(D) > 0, \u03bd(D c ) > 0.\n\n(2.3)\n\nFor any x \u2208 X, A \u2208 B(X \u00d7 \u03a3) let\nAx = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a3 : (x, \u03c9) \u2208 A}, LA (x) = px (Ax ),\nAX = {y \u2208 X : LA (y) > 0}.\nClearly Ax \u2208 B(\u03a3), AX \u2208 B(X); the latter is true because LA \u2208 B. Indeed,\nif we set L = {E \u2208 B(X \u00d7 \u03a3) : LE \u2208 B}, then L is a \u03bb-system containing\n6\n\n\fthe \u03c0-system P of Borel measurable rectangles, subsets of X \u00d7 \u03a3. By the\nSierpi\u0144ski-Dynkin theorem on \u03c0-\u03bb-systems, L \u2283 \u03c3(P) = B(X \u00d7 \u03a3).\nFrom the S-invariance of D it follows that\nX\npi (x)LD (Si (x)) = LD (x) for every x \u2208 X,\n(2.4)\nI\n\nwhich, in turn, implies that P (*, D X ) \u2264 1DX . Thus \u03bc(D X ) = 1; similarly\n\u03bc((D c )X ) = 1. Therefore there exists a set X\u0303 \u2208 B(X) of full measure \u03bc such\nthat (D c )x = (Dx )c 6= \u2205 for every x \u2208 X\u0303. Consequently, LD + LDc is \u03bc-a.e.\nequal to 1. We are going to examine properties of LD more precisely.\nClaim 1. LD is \u03bc-a.e. constant.\nSet Xl = L\u22121\nD (l, \u221e), where l > 0 is such that \u03bc(Xl ) > 0. Consider the\nmeasure \u03bc\u0303 define by the formula: \u03bc\u0303(E) = \u03bc (E \u2229 Xl ) for E \u2208 B(X). We are\ngoing to prove that \u03bc\u0303 is invariant. Since \u03bc is so, \u03bc\u0303P \u226a \u03bc. Furthermore,\nputting\nd\u03bc\u0303 d\u03bc\u0303P\ng=\n\u2212\nd\u03bc\nd\u03bc\nR\nwe get (LD \u2212 l)g \u2265 0 \u03bc-a.e. and g d\u03bc = 0. Hence\nZ\nLD g d\u03bc \u2265 0\nX\n\nwith equality iff g \u03bc-a.e. equal to 0. But\nZ\nZ\nZ\nLD g d\u03bc =\nLD d\u03bc\u0303 \u2212\nLD d\u03bc\u0303P = 0,\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nwhere the last equality is a consequence of (2.4). Thus \u03bc\u0303 is an invariant\nmeasure absolutely continuous w.r.t. \u03bc. Lemma 3 gives \u03bc = \u03bc\u0303, which proves\nour claim.\nTo finish the proof of Lemma 5 it suffices to justify\nClaim 2. The following disjunction holds\nLD = 1\n\n\u03bc-a.e.\n\nor\n\nLDc = 1\n\n\u03bc-a.e.\n\n(2.5)\n\nAssume the contrary and fix an \u03b5 > 0 so small that the sets {LD > 1 \u2212 \u03b5}\nand {LDc > 1 \u2212 \u03b5} have both zero measure \u03bc. Put \u039b(A, \u03c9 n ) = {x \u2208 X :\npx (Ax \u2229 C\u03c9n ) > (1 \u2212 \u03b5)px (C\u03c9n )} for any n \u2208 N, \u03c9 n \u2208 I n and A \u2282 X \u00d7 \u03a3. We\nare going to show that\n[\nX\u0303 \u2282\nZ,\n(2.6)\nZ\u2208F\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nwhere F = {\u039b(A, \u03c9 ) : n \u2208 N, \u03c9 \u2208 I , A \u2208 {D, D c }}.\n7\n\n\fPick any x \u2208 X\u0303 then. Two cases may occur: either px is nonatomic or\nit has at least one atom. In the second case that atom, let us call it \u03c9, may\nbe a member of Dx (then we conclude that x \u2208 \u039b(D, \u03c9 n ) for some n \u2208 N)\nor it may happen that \u03c9 \u2208 (D c )x (in this case there exists n \u2208 N such that\nx \u2208 \u039b(D c , \u03c9 n )).\nNow suppose x \u2208 X\u0303 is such that px has no atoms. By means of the \"Cantor function\"-type construction it is easy to build a measure-preserving homeomorphism between the spaces (\u03a3, B(\u03a3), px ) and ([0, 1], B([0, 1]), \u03bb), which\ntransforms cylinders into some intervals. This and the Lebesgue theorem\non density points applied to Dx imply the existence of \u03c9 n \u2208 I n such that\nx \u2208 \u039b(D, \u03c9 n). The proof of (2.6) is finished.\nTo make use of (2.6) we notice that the family F \u2282 B(X) is countable\nand each member of F has zero measure \u03bc. It is so since, by the definition\nof px and S-invariance of sets D, D c ,\nfor A \u2208 {D, D c}, n \u2208 N, \u03c9 n \u2208 I n .\n\u039b(A, \u03c9 n ) \u2282 S\u03c9\u22121\nn ({LA > 1 \u2212 \u03b5})\nBut this implies the equality \u03bc(X\u0303) = 0 which contradicts the way we chose\nthe set X\u0303.\nOn account of Lemma 5, the Egorov theorem and the Birkhoff ergodic\ntheorem, we have an immediate corollary:\nCorollary 6. Let \u03bc be ergodic. Then for every \u03b5 > 0 and for any family of\nBorel measurable functions {hi : X \u2192 R}I satisfying the inequalities\nZ X\n\u2212\u221e <\npi hi d\u03bc < 0\nX\n\nI\n\nthere exist K > 0, AK \u2208 B(X \u00d7 \u03a3) such that \u03bd(AK ) < \u03b5 and\nn\nX\n\nh\u03c9j (S\u03c9j\u22121 (x)) < K\n\nj=1\n\nfor all (x, \u03c9) \u2208 AK c and all n \u2208 N.\nLet us go back to Example 2. Let \u03bc be any invariant measure for\n(X, Si , pi ). As \u03bcP n = \u03bc, \u03bc([k * 3\u2212n , (k + 1) * 3\u2212n )) \u2264 (1 \u2212 p)n \u0581 0, \u03bc\ncannot have atoms. It implies that \u03bc(B\u03b4 (\u2202A)) \u0581 0 as \u03b4 \u0581 0.\nP\nThe function integrated in the definition of hN (\u03bc, \u03b4) equals \u2212N 2i=1 pi (x) log pi (x)\u03bc(dx)\nfor all x whose all trajectories avoid B\u03b4 (\u2202A) for time N and is bounded by\n\u2212N log p everywhere. Hence, by Lebesgue majorized convergence theorem\n8\n\n\f1\nhN (\u03bc) = \u2212\nN\n\nZ X\n2\n\npi (x) log pi (x)\u03bc(dx) = \u2212p log p \u2212 (1 \u2212 p) log(1 \u2212 p)\n\nX i=1\n\nAt the same time, \u03bbN (\u03bc, \u03b4) = \u2212N log 3 for all N and \u03b4 and (1.2) follows.\nThe one thing remaining to check is that (X, Si , pi ) from Example 2 has\nany invariant measures at all. Let \u03bc0 be any probabilistic measure on X and\ndefine\nn\u22121\n1X\n\u03bc0 P m\n\u03bcn =\nn m=0\n\nAs \u03bcn form a sequence of probabilistic measures on a compact space,\nthey have a subsequence \u03bcnk convergent in law to some measure \u03bc. Let us\nfix \u03b5 > 0. As \u03bc0 P n ([k * 3\u2212m, (k + 1) * 3\u2212m)) \u2264 (1 \u2212 p)m for all n > m, the same\n3\n\u03b5\nis true for \u03bc. It follows that \u03bc cannot have atoms, hence \u03bc(Br (\u2202A)) \u2264 13\nfor r small enough. As \u03bcnk converges to \u03bc,\n\u03bcnk (Br (\u2202A) \u2264\n\n3\n\u03b5\n13\n\n(2.7)\n\nand\nX\n\n|\u03bcnk (Di ) \u2212 \u03bc(Di )| \u2264\n\nDi\n\n3\n\u03b5\n13\n\n(2.8)\n\nfor k big enough (where the sum is taken over the components of the complement of Br (\u2202A)). We will prove that \u03bcP = \u03bc.\nLet dF M be the Fortet-Mourier metric [FM] on the space of finite measures, defined as\nZ\nZ\ndF M (\u03bc, \u03bd) = sup\nf d\u03bc \u2212\nf d\u03bd\nX\n\nX\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over Lipschitz functions with Lipschitz constant\n1 and with absolute value bounded by 1. It is well known that the topology\ndefined by Fortet-Mourier metric is equivalent to the usual weak* topology,\nsee [D].\nAs \u03bcnk converge to \u03bc, we have\ndF M (\u03bcnk , \u03bc) \u2264\n\nfor k big enough.\nBy the definition of \u03bcnk we have\n9\n\n3\n\u03b5\n13\n\n(2.9)\n\n\fdF M (\u03bcnk , \u03bcnk P ) =\n\n1\n1\n3\ndF M (\u03bc0 , \u03bc0 P nk ) \u2264\n\u2264 \u03b5\nnk\nnk\n13\n\n(2.10)\n\nfor k big enough.\nWe can write\n\u0001 X\ndF M (\u03bcnk P, \u03bcP ) \u2264 dF M (\u03c7Br (\u2202A) \u03bcnk )P, (\u03c7Br (\u2202A) \u03bc)P +\ndF M ((\u03c7Di \u03bcnk )P, (\u03c7Di \u03bc)P )\nDi\n\nAs the Fortet-Mourier distance of two measures cannot be greater than\nthe sum of their L1 -norms, by (2.7)\n\n3\n\u03b5\n13\nTo estimate the following sum note that on each Di the iterated function\nsystem acts as two linear contracting maps with contraction coefficients 1/3,\none chosen with fixed probability p and the other (1 \u2212 p). Hence, the FortetMourier distance of images of two measures is bounded from above by 1/3\nof the Fortet-Mourier distance of the original measures plus the difference of\nL1 -norms of the original measures.

Namely, notice that w.l.o.g.\nwe may assume that X do not contain any isolated points. Indeed, every\nisolated point is either of zero measure \u03bc and therefore can be removed from\nthe space (without changing dimH (\u03bc)) or has it positive. In the second case\n\u03bc is concentrated on a finite set and consequently dimH (\u03bc) = 0.\n10\n\n\fLemma 7. If hN (\u03bc, \u03b4) and \u03bbN (\u03bc, \u03b4) exist, they are subadditive in N.\nProof. Both hN (\u03bc, \u03b4) and \u03bbN (\u03bc, \u03b4) can be written in the form\nZ X\np\u03c9N (x)\nsup\n\u03c6(x, y, \u03c9 N ) \u03bc(dx),\ny\u2208BN (x,\u03c9 N ,\u03b4)\n\nN\nN\nX \u03c9 \u2208I\n\nwhere\n\u03c6(x, y, \u03c9 N ) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c6(S\u03c9n\u22121 (x), S\u03c9n\u22121 (y), \u03c9n )\n\nn=1\n\nis some real-valued function. Given N1 and N2 , for any fixed \u03b4 we have\ny \u2208 BN1 +N2 (x, \u03c9 N1 +N2 , \u03b4) if and only if y \u2208 BN1 (x, \u03c9 N1 , \u03b4) and S\u03c9N1 (y) \u2208\nBN1 (S\u03c9N1 (x), \u03c9N1 +1 . . . \u03c9N1 +N2 , \u03b4).

We need to prove\nthat dimH (\u03bc) \u2264 hN (\u03bc, \u03b4)/\u03bbN (\u03bc, \u03b4). We will only give the detailed proof for\nN = 1, for higher N one works with P N instead of P and the proof is almost\nidentical.\nWe are going to analyze a family of measures {\u03bcj,\u03c9n }, which sum up to \u03bc\nand are associated with a certain finite partition {Ej } of X. Every measure\n\u03bcj,\u03c9n is concentrated on B(S\u03c9n (ej ), |S\u03c9n (Ej )|) (where ej \u2208 Ej ) \u2013 typically\na set of small diameter. We will choose some of the pairs (j, \u03c9 n ) in such a\nway that the union of sets B(S\u03c9n (ej ), |S\u03c9n (Ej )|) corresponding to the chosen\npairs will be both of big measure \u03bc and geometrically small (see Lemma 8).\nWe will use these balls to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of \u03bc.\nWe need some additional notations: for i \u2208 I, x \u2208 X, \u03b8 < 0, \u03b4 > 0, m \u2208\nN, \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a3 we will write\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u033a(Si (x), Si (y)) \uf8fd\n\u03b4,\u03b8\nLi (x) = max\nsup log\n,\u03b8\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u033a(x, y)\n\uf8f3y\u2208B(x,\u03b4)\n\uf8fe\ny6=x\n\nHi\u03b4 (x) =\n\ninf\n\ny\u2208B(x,\u03b4)\n\n11\n\nlog pi (y),\n\n\fm\u22121\n1 X \u03b4,\u03b8\nL\n(S k (x)),\nm k=0 \u03c9k+1 \u03c9\n\nL\u03b4,\u03b8\nm (x, \u03c9) =\n\nm\u22121\n1 X \u03b4\nH\n(S k (x)),\nm k=0 \u03c9k+1 \u03c9\nZ X\n=\npi L\u03b4,\u03b8\ni d\u03bc,\n\n\u03b4\nHm\n(x, \u03c9) =\n\nIL\u03b4,\u03b8\n\nX\n\n\u03b4\nIH\n=\n\nI\n\nZ X\nX\n\npi Hi\u03b4 d\u03bc,\n\nI\n\n\u03b4\ns(\u03b4, \u03b8) = IH\n/IL\u03b4,\u03b8 .\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\nNote that inequality (1.1) holds if IH\n= \u2212\u221e for each \u03b4 > 0. So, since IH\nis\na nonincreasing function of \u03b4, w.l.o.g. we can assume that there is \u2206 \u2208 (0, 1)\n\u03b4\nsuch that for every \u03b4 \u2208 (0, \u2206) the integral IH\nis finite and, at the same time,\nthe corresponding integral from the denominator of the right-hand side of\n(1.1) is negative (see comments in the first section) or equal to \u2212\u221e. In the\nlatter case there exists a number \u0398 < 0 such that IL\u2206,\u03b8 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0) for all\n\u03b8 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u0398]. In the former one we set \u0398 = \u2212\u221e \u2013 that constant would play\nno role in the proof then.\nObviously s (considered on (0, \u2206) \u00d7 [\u2212\u221e, \u0398]) is a nondecreasing function\nof every variable with another one fixed. Moreover, the limit of s, taken as\n(\u03b4, \u03b8) \u2192 (0, \u2212\u221e), is equal to the right-hand side of (1.1).\nAfter making these introductory remarks we can start the proof. First we\nchoose (\u03b4, \u03b8) from the domain of s. Next we fix s > s(\u03b4, \u03b8) and \u03b9 \u2208 N in an\narbitrary way. We also pick \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1/\u03b9) such that s > s(\u03b4, \u03b8)(1 + \u03b5)/(1 \u2212 \u03b5)\nand then we apply Corollary 6 for \u03b5 and {L\u03b4,\u03b8\ni }I \u2013 we are allowed since\n\u03b4,\u03b8\nIL \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0). As a result we obtain K, AK .\nLet {Ej }J be a finite family of nonempty disjoint Borel subsets of X, of\ndiameter at most \u03b4e\u2212K /4 and such that\n!\n[\n\u03bc\nEj > 1 \u2212 \u03b5,\nJ\n\nS\nwhere J \u2282 N.

Fix points ej \u2208 Ej . Since \u03bc is invariant, we get\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n[\nX\n\u03bc \uf8ed B(S\u03c9n (ej ), |S\u03c9n (Ej )|)\uf8f8 \u2265 1 \u2212\nk\u03bcj,\u03c9n k ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nZ(\u03b9)c\n\nZ(\u03b9)\n\nregardless of n and Z(\u03b9) \u2282 {J \u222a {0}} \u00d7 I n . Hence, we only need to estimate\nthe sum of k\u03bcj,\u03c9n k over pairs (j, \u03c9 n ) for which i), ii) or iii) does not hold.\nFirst we are going to establish how big n0 should be. Lemma 5 and\n\u03b4,\u03b8\n\u03b4\nthe Birkhoff theorem show that L\u03b4,\u03b8\nm (x, \u03c9) converges to IL and Hm (x, \u03c9)\n\u03b4\nconverges to IH\nfor \u03bc-almost every x \u2208 X and px -almost every \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a3. By\nthe Egorov theorem we can choose a big (w.r.t. \u03bc) subset X0 \u2208 B(X) for\nwhich those convergences are uniform for a big set of \u03c9's. Specifying, we\nhave n0 \u2208 N, X0 \u2208 B(X) such that\n\u03bc(X0 ) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b5\n13\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fand for every x \u2208 X0 , the set of \u03c9 which does not satisfy\n\u03b4,\u03b8\n\u03b4,\u03b8 \u03b4\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n|L\u03b4,\u03b8\nn (x, \u03c9) \u2212 IL | + |Hn (x, \u03c9) \u2212 IH | \u2264 \u2212\u03b5 max{IL , IH }\n\n(3.4)\n\nfor some n > n0 , has px -measure not greater than \u03b5.\nNow we are going to construct Z(\u03b9). We fix n > n0 . Notice that Z(\u03b9)\ncannot contain any element of the form (0, \u03c9 n). Let us denote the set of all\nsuch pairs by A1 . We obtain\nX\n(3.5)\nk\u03bcj,\u03c9n k = \u03bc(E0 ) < \u03b5.\nA1\n\nNext, we want to exclude from Z(\u03b9) the set A2 of all the pairs (j, \u03c9 n ) \u2208 Ac1\nfor which i) does not hold. So we take (j, \u03c9 n ) \u2208 A2 , i.e. such that\n|S\u03c9m (Ej )| > \u03b4\nfor some m \u2264 n, but\n|S\u03c9u (Ej )| \u2264 \u03b4\nfor all u < m. We have\n\u03b4 < sup \u033a(S\u03c9m (x), S\u03c9m (y))\ny\u2208Ej\n\nfor some x \u2208 Ej . Furthermore\nsup \u033a(S\n\n\u03c9m\n\n(x), S\n\n\u03c9m\n\n(y)) \u2264 |Ej |\n\ny\u2208Ej\n\n\u2264\n\nm\u22121\nY\n\nsup\n\nc\n\n\u22121\nu=0 y\u2208S\u03c9 u (S\u03c9 u {x}) \u2229Ej\n|Ej | exp(mL\u03b4,\u03b8\nm (x, \u03c9)),\n\n\u033a(S\u03c9u+1 (x), S\u03c9u+1 (y))\n\u033a(S\u03c9u (x), S\u03c9u (y))\n\nwhere \u03c9 is any continuation of the finite sequence \u03c9 n . Thus Ej \u00d7 C\u03c9n \u2282 AK ,\nand so\nX\n(3.6)\nk\u03bcj,\u03c9n k < \u03b5.\nA2\n\nThe last set to exclude is the one containing the elements for which we\ncannot make use of the choice of n0 . We distinguish the set A3 of pairs (j, \u03c9 n )\nwith j such that Ej does not intersect X0 ; here, by (3.3), we have\nX\n(3.7)\nk\u03bcj,\u03c9n k \u2264 \u03b5.\nA3\n\n14\n\n\fNext, for every (j, \u03c9 n ) \u2208 Ac3 let us choose a point xj \u2208 Ej \u2229 X0 . Denote by\nA4 the set of pairs (j, \u03c9 n ) \u2208 Ac3 such that (3.4) does not hold for (x, \u03c9) \u2208\n{xj } \u00d7 C\u03c9n and n. Again,\nX\n(3.8)\nk\u03bcj,\u03c9n k \u2264 \u03b5.\nA4\n\nLet Z(\u03b9) =\nn\u22121\nY\n\nT4\n\nt=1\n\nAct . Since i) and (3.4) hold for (j, \u03c9 n ) \u2208 Z(\u03b9), we obtain\n\nk\n\np\u03c9k+1 (j; \u03c9 ) \u2265\n\nk=0\n\nk=0\n\nand\n\nn\u22121\nY\n\n|S\u03c9n (Ej )| \u2264 2|Ej |\n\nn\u22121\nY\nk=0\n\ninf\n\ny\u2208B(S\u03c9 k (xj ),|S\u03c9 k (Ej )|)\n\n\u03b4\n\np\u03c9k+1 (y) \u2265 en(1+\u03b5)IH\n\n(3.9)\n\n\u033a(S\u03c9k+1 (xj ), S\u03c9k+1 (y))\n\u033a(S\u03c9k (xj ), y)\ny\u2208B(S\u03c9 k (xj ),|S\u03c9 k (Ej )|)\nsup\n\ny6=S\u03c9 k (xj )\n\nwhich implies that\n\u03b4,\u03b8\n\n(3.10)\n|S\u03c9n (Ej )| \u2264 \u03b4e\u2212K+n(1\u2212\u03b5)IL /2.\nP Qn\u22121\nBy (3.10), ii) is satisfied. Similarly, as \u03c9n k=0 p\u03c9k+1 (j; \u03c9 k ) = 1 for every\nj \u2208 J, (3.9) implies iii). The assertion iv) follows from (3.5), (3.6), (3.7),\n(3.8) and (3.2). We are done.\nThe rest of the proof is standard. Let ej \u2208 Ej be any points. The set\n[\nY\u03b9 =\nB(S\u03c9n (ej ), |S\u03c9n (Ej )|)\nZ(\u03b9)\n\nhas measure \u03bc at least 1 \u2212 4\u03b5. At the same time it can be covered with a\nfamily\n(3.11)\n{B(S\u03c9n (ej ), |S\u03c9n (Ej )|)}(j,\u03c9n )\u2208Z(\u03b9)\n\u03b4,\u03b8\n\n\u03b4\n\nof at most \u266fJe\u2212n(1+\u03b5)IH sets of diameter less than \u03b4e\u2212K+n(1\u2212\u03b5)IL .\nThe set\n\\[\nY =\nY\u03ba\n\u03b9 \u03ba>\u03b9\n\nhas full measure \u03bc. At the\nS same time Y has zero s-dimensional Hausdorff\nmeasure, because Y \u2282 \u03ba>\u03b9 Y\u03ba for every \u03b9, the diameter of covers (3.11)\nconverges to 0 as \u03b9 \u2192 \u221e and (3.1) yields the inequality\nX\nX\n|B(S\u03c9n (ej ), |S\u03c9n (Ej )|)|s < 2\u2212\u03b9 .\n\u03ba>\u03b9 (j,\u03c9 n )\u2208Z(\u03ba)\n\nSince s > s(\u03b4, \u03b8) was arbitrary, the Hausdorff dimension of \u03bc is not greater\nthan s(\u03b4, \u03b8). As \u2212\u03b8 > 0 can be chosen arbitrarily big, we get the assertion.\n\n15\n\n\fReferences\n[D]\n\nR. M. Dudley, Probabilities and Metrics, Aarhus Universitet, 1976.\n\n[E]\n\nJ. H.
