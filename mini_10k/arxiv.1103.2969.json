Semiconductor quantum\ndots have recently been shown to conveniently emit entangled light when driven\nelectrically, however the fidelity was not optimal. Here we show that the fidelity is\nnot limited by decoherence, but by coherent interaction with nuclei. Furthermore we\npredict that on 100\u03bcs timescales, strongly enhanced fidelities could be achieved. This\ninsight could allow tailoring of quantum logic to operate using quantum dots in the\nfault tolerant regime.\n\n-1-\n\n\fMain Text\nQuantum logic based on linear optics [1] is emerging as a promising architecture to\nrealise quantum computers powerful enough to solve currently intractable problems in\nscience and engineering. One of the resources required for a quantum processor are\nentangled photons, which recently have been generated electrically in an entangledlight-emitting diode (ELED) incorporating a single semiconductor quantum dot [2].\nThe practical advantages of an electrically operated entangled light source are\nappealing, as they can be easily controlled, and many independent devices may be\nincorporated into integrated quantum optical circuits. However the entanglement\nfidelity of ELEDs is currently sub-optimal which can result in errors in quantum\ngates. Here we explore the limits behind the entanglement fidelity, to reveal\ninteractions of excitons with nuclei as a dominant process. Furthermore we predict\nsignificantly enhanced fidelity under different measurement conditions for the same\nELED device.\n\nPrevious experiments using pulsed optical excitation have already revealed a great\ndeal about the entanglement dynamics of photon pairs emitted by quantum dots [3, 4,\n5]. Effects previously considered include background light from other regions of the\nsample (such as the wetting layer), detector characteristics such as jitter and dark\ncounts, and properties of the quantum dot itself such as radiative lifetimes, the finestructure-splitting between the optically active exciton levels, exciton-spin scattering\nand cross-dephasing. The latter term describes the process whereby the coherence\nbetween the two intermediate photon-exciton eigenstates states is lost, without\naffecting the polarisation (spin) properties of the states, and was found previously to\nhave only a weak effect [4]. In the work presented here decoherence of this type was\nfound to be negligible so we shall disregard its effect from the start to simplify the\ndiscussion, though we will show certain coherent effects can give rise to similar\napparent dephasing when averaged over time.\n\nModels based on the above parameters cannot however account for all observed\nbehaviour. For example, the majority of quantum dots with small splitting tend to\nshow stronger polarisation anti-correlation in the circular basis, than polarisation\ncorrelation in the linear bases [6, 2, 7, 8, 9]. The effect is more pronounced in recent\n\n-2-\n\n\fmeasurements of an ELED in d.c. mode, where anti-bunching persists for longer for\nco-circularly polarised photons [2].\n\nThe unpredicted behaviour in experiments may be attributed to weakly coupled\neigenstates that are partially circularly polarised [6]. This would lead to circularly\npolarised photon pair states that evolve more slowly, resulting in persistent antibunching and stronger time-averaged correlations. The most obvious underlying\ncoupling mechanism responsible is interaction of the exciton spin states with the\natomic nuclei within the semiconductor quantum dot, which has been extensively\nstudied in quantum dots in terms of its strength, polarisation properties, and influence\non spin-storage [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The isotopes of gallium, indium and arsenic that\nmake up the quantum dot are all spin active, and each randomly oriented nuclear spin\ninteracts with the exciton states via the hyperfine interaction. For the purposes of our\nanalysis, we adopt the convention of approximating the effect of the nuclear\npopulation as a net magnetic field BN (Overhauser field). The net nuclear field\nfluctuates on a timescale of ~100 \u03bcs, has random orientation, and normally distributed\nstrength with mean zero and standard deviation of tens of mT [10, 15].\n\nThe fine-structure properties of single quantum dot excitons in the presence of\nexternal magnetic fields are strongly orientation dependent [16, 17]. When the field is\napplied in-plane, hybridisation of optically active with inactive states results in no\nchange in the polarisation of the exciton eigenstates, and a weak, quadratic change in\nthe fine-structure splitting. For our quantum dots the magnitude of the change is\n~2\u03bceVT-2 [17], so the expected modification of the fine structure is of the order 1neV.\nThis is far smaller than the typical splitting of entanglement-optimised quantum dots\nof the order 1\u03bceV. The effect of nuclear fields in the plane can therefore be neglected\nfor this analysis.\n\nWhen applied in the normal direction, a magnetic field lifts the degeneracy between\nexciton states of opposing spin, resulting in a significant linear change in the finestructure-splitting of ~200\u03bceVT-1 [18]. Thus we expect fluctuations of the finestructure-splitting of the order of a few \u03bceV due to the net nuclear field in this\ndirection, which is comparable to the typical splitting of quantum dots. Therefore for\nour analysis, we must include the effect of fluctuating nuclear magnetic fields in the\n-3-\n\n\fnormal direction. In addition, diamagnetic effects are neglected as they are\npolarisation independent [16, 17, 18]\n\nThe effect of a normally oriented magnetic field on the energies of the upper (Xu) and\nlower (Xl) exciton levels are shown schematically in Figure 1(a). The horizontal axis\nrepresents the circularly polarised component of the fine-structure-splitting, which is\nproportional to the magnetic field. The plotted energies and depicted polarisations of\nthe states Xu and Xl are solutions to the following Hamiltonian expressed in the {XH,\nXV} basis, which denote exciton states that emit horizontal (H) and vertical (V)\npolarised photons.\nH\uf03d\n\n1 \uf0e6 \uf02d S r iS c \uf0f6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0d7\uf0e7\n2 \uf0e7\uf0e8 \uf02d iS c S r \uf0f7\uf0f8\n\nHere Sc and Sr denote the circular and rectilinear components of the fine-structure2\n\n2\n\nsplitting S between the optically active exciton eigenstates, given by S \uf03d S c \uf02b S r .\nSignificant modification of the splitting is predicted for Sc\uf0b3Sr; the polarisation of\nphotons emitted by the exciton eigenstates are expected to be linear for Sc<<Sr,\ncircular for Sc>>Sr, and elliptical for Sc~Sr, as indicated by arrows in Figure 1(a). We\nnote that Sc cannot be determined experimentally by the usual spectroscopy\ntechniques used to resolve circular polarisation splitting, as fluctuations of Sc over the\ncourse of the measurement average to zero. In contrast, Sr can be determined\nexperimentally, as limited spectral resolution results in measurement of the average\nphoton energy projected onto each linear polarisation, which is independent of Sc.\nThe modification in fine-structure-splitting and polarisation of the exciton states by\nfluctuating Sc, introduced by the net nuclear field, consequently changes the form of\nthe entangled photon pair state emitted by the decay of the biexciton state (XX) in a\nquantum dot. This is shown schematically in Figure 1(c). The decay proceeds via\neither Xl or Xu, in each case emitting a pair of photons. The polarisation of each\nphoton is shown, and in the general case are all found to be non-equivalent,\nelliptically polarised states. Including the phase difference acquired during the time \uf074\nspent in the intermediate entangled exciton-photon state [5], the emitted entangled\nphoton pair state is;\n\n-4-\n\n\f\uf059i \uf03d \uf028\uf061 H XX \uf02d i\uf062 V XX\n\uf02b e iS\uf074\n\n\uf068\n\n\uf028\uf061 V\n\nXX\n\n\uf029\uf028\uf061 H\n\n\uf02d i\uf062 H XX\n\nX\n\n\uf02b i\uf062 V X\n\n\uf029\uf028\uf061 V\n\nX\n\n\uf029\n\n2\n\n\uf02b i\uf062 H X\n\n\uf029\n\n2\n\nwhere weights \uf061 and \uf062 are shown in Figure 1(b) and are given by the relationships\n\n\uf061 2 \uf02b \uf062 2 \uf03d 1 , and \uf062 \uf061 \uf03d S c \uf028 S r \uf02b S \uf029 .\n\nInspection\n\nof\n\nthe\n\n\uf059i \uf0bb \uf028 H XX H X\n\n\uf029\n\nabove\n2 \uf02b e iS\uf074\n\n\uf068\n\nequation\n\n\uf028V\n\nXX\n\nVX\n\n\uf029\n\nreveals\n\nthat\n\nfor\n\nSc~0,\n\n\u03b2~0\n\nand\n\n2 , reverting to the usual form for the\n\nentangled state from a quantum dot [5].

It is based on a system of rate equations derived from a multi-level\napproximation of the quantum dot, as depicted in Figure 2(a). Since the exciton basis\nstates of the quantum dot are dependent on the fluctuating nuclear magnetic field,\npolarisation and/or spin is a poor choice to differentiate between states, so instead we\nlabel the four levels in terms of the number of excitons in the dot, and their coherent\nproperties. The resulting levels are the initial coherent exciton state XC, produced by\nemission of a previously detected coherent biexciton photon, and the incoherent\nground (G), exciton (XS) and biexciton (XX) states. The levels are linked by reexcitation at rate proportional to p (yellow arrows), radiative decay at rates \u0393XX and\n\u0393X (purple arrows) and spin-scattering at rate \u0393S (green arrow).\nThe rate equations are constructed and solved using standard methods, and the density\nmatrix that describes the intensity and polarisation of the two-photon state \uf072 is\ncomputed as follows;\n\n\uf072 \uf028 S r , Sc ,\uf074 \uf029 \uf0b5 k \uf028 X C \uf028\uf074 \uf029\uf072 e \uf028 S r , S c ,\uf074 \uf029 \uf02b X S \uf028\uf074 \uf029\uf072 m \uf029 \uf02b \uf0281 \uf02d k \uf029\uf072 m\nwhere \uf074 is the time delay between emission of the biexciton and exciton photons, k is\nthe fraction of light originating exclusively from the dot, \uf072e is the density matrix for\nentangled light \uf059 \uf059 , and \uf072m the density matrix for maximally mixed light equal to\n\n-5-\n\n\fthe identity matrix I4/4. Similar methods are used to construct the density matrix for\nnegative time delays, which correspond to emission of an XX photon after detection\nof an X photon.\n\nTo account for fluctuations in the nuclear magnetic field, a weighted average of \uf072 is\nnumerically obtained from a normally distributed Sc with standard deviation \uf073 and\nmean zero, as Sc is proportional to the normally distributed nuclear magnetic field.\nThe resulting distribution of splitting magnitudes |S|/\uf073 is shown in Figure 2(b), for\ndifferent ratios of Sr/\uf073. For Sr/\uf073=0, the distribution of |S| is Gaussian with standard\ndeviation \uf073, as it is defined solely by the effect of the nuclear magnetic field. For\nincreasing Sr/\uf073, the form of the distribution becomes more exponential-like,\naccompanied by distinct narrowing. This illustrates that for large Sr/\uf073, the magnitude\nof the splitting is almost constant so nuclear magnetic field fluctuations are\nunimportant.\n\nThe model was used to fit the second-order cross correlation measurements presented\nin [2], for a d.c. electrically excited quantum dot. The d.c. injection scheme is ideally\nsuited for this analysis as the excitation rate is independent of time, and correlations\nare not as strongly dominated by the radiative decay time compared to pulsed\nexcitation. However the model and conclusions discussed here are equally relevant to\npulsed and/or optical excitation. Second-order cross correlations were calculated as a\nfunction of time delay \u03c4, by projection of the calculated density matrix onto the\ncorresponding polarised photon pair states. Finally the traces were convolved with a\nGaussian approximation of the actual detector response functions to account for finite\ndetector resolution. The corresponding experimental and fitted correlations are shown\nin Figure 3 for photon pairs measured in the rectilinear (a), diagonal (b) and circular\n(c) polarisation bases. Excellent qualitative agreement is observed, revealing nuclear\nspin effects to be responsible for much of the characteristic shape of photon\ncorrelations.\n\nThe fitted parameters were k=0.866, \uf073=2.47\u03bceV, and \u0393S=0, where k represents the\nfraction of photon pairs originating from the dot and is found to be similar to previous\n\n-6-\n\n\fmeasurements [5]. All other parameters were experimentally measured. The fact that\nno spin-scattering term is required is surprising, as it suggests that photon pair\nemission from the quantum dot does not suffer dephasing and is fully coherent.\n\nThe fitted standard deviation \u03c3 of the circular component of the fine structure splitting\nSc is equivalent to the standard deviation of the energy fluctuations caused by the\nnuclear spins \u03bcBge\u0394BN, where ge is the electron g factor. Our quantum dots are\nexpected to be quite small due to their high emission energy, and consisting of ~104\natoms[19]. For dots of this size \u03bcBge\u0394BN is ~1.5 \u03bceV in GaAs and ~3.4 \u03bceV in InAs,\nthe latter stronger due to the larger value for the indium nuclear spin (9/2) compared\nto gallium (3/2)[11, 20, 21]. Thus the extracted value of \uf073=2.47\u03bceV is consistent with\na small InAs quantum dot intermixed with GaAs, as expected in our samples.\n\nQuantitative agreement is assessed using the degree of polarisation, defined as the\ndifference between co- and cross-polarised correlations, divided by their sum.\nSimulations result in optimum values of 0.60, 0.59 and -0.77 measured for the\nrectilinear, diagonal, and circular polarisation bases, which are in very good\nagreement with the corresponding experimentally measured values of 0.63\u00b10.05,\n0.57\u00b10.06 and -0.77\u00b10.04 respectively.\n\nThe physical effect of nuclear fields can clearly be seen in the correlation traces. For\ndots with very small splitting such as this (measured to be 0.4 \u03bceV), the quantum dots\nhave strongly circularly polarised eigenstates due to the nuclear magnetic field and\nthus oscillations of g(2) with \uf074 are expected in the rectilinear and diagonal bases as the\nphase between XL and XR evolves. The frequency of these oscillations is proportional\nto S, thus averaging over the distribution of S results in an additional damping term,\nwhich is Gaussian in form and of width \u0127/\u03c3~270ps, originating from the Fourier\ntransform of the normally distributed S (see Figure 2(b)). This results in faster\nconvergence of the correlated and anti-correlated traces in the rectilinear and diagonal\nbases, as observed experimentally and theoretically.\n\nThe finite temporal resolution of our measurement system means that the same\ndamping of coherent oscillations effect reduces the maximum and minimum\n\n-7-\n\n\fobservable correlations due to averaging. This explains why the overall degree of\ncorrelation is stronger in the circular basis, common for dots with small splitting (Sr).\nSimilarly, the finite temporal resolution also results in a reduction of the overall\ndegree of correlation in the circular and diagonal bases for dots with non-zero Sr,\nThus whether the polarisation correlation measured in the circular basis dominates\nover that measured in the linear basis[6, 2, 7, 9], or vice versa[22, 23, 24, 25, 26],\ndepends on the nuclear spin configuration and splitting Sr of the quantum dot, and the\nmeasurement technique employed.\n\nCombining the above effects of finite Sr, Sc, and timing resolution can result in a\nlargely uncorrelated contribution to the two-photon density matrix, which could form\na component of the polarisation uncorrelated fraction of photon pairs always observed\nin entangled photon pair emission from dots with small Sr (see e.g. refs [3, 24, 25, 26,\n7]). Our conclusions may therefore offer a coherent mechanism to explain the\napparent spin-scattering or depolarisation of the exciton spin states, observed in\nprevious experiments.\n\nIt is well known that suppression of the fine-structure-splitting S is advantageous for\nmany entangled photon experiments and applications, in order to minimise the phase\nevolution between orthogonally polarised photon pair states. Thus similarly to the\nreduction of Sr, it may be beneficial to supress the hyperfine interaction and hence Sc.\nThis is commonly achieved by applying external magnetic fields[27, 28], or\npolarizing the nuclear spin population[19, 13]. In addition, the dependence of\nhyperfine interaction strength on the size and alloy of the quantum dot suggests using\nlarger, GaAs rich quantum dots, will supress effects attributed to nuclear fields.\n\nWe stress that the timescale for fluctuations of nuclear fields are of the order ~100\u03bcs\n[10] up to several seconds in the presence of external fields [28], so although they can\nlead to apparent decoherence on timescales typical of present experiments, they are\neffectively static over the time required to do a quantum gate operation, and thus do\nnot cause decoherence. This fact has been demonstrated numerous times by the use of\necho techniques which effectively cancel the effect of the nuclear field experienced in\neach individual cycle [12, 28]. Therefore the entangled state emitted by a quantum dot\nis expected to be stable for ~104 \u2013 108 cycles, when operating at 100MHz, which in\n-8-\n\n\fprinciple is sufficient for many applications, negating the need to control the\nhyperfine interaction at all. This is true even for finite fine-structure-splitting S, as the\ntime-evolving entangled state can be temporally resolved.\n\nIt is interesting to estimate the entanglement properties of the ELED accessible to\nfuture applications. For this purpose, we begin with the measured and calculated timeaveraged fidelity of the entangled light as a function of the time delay between\nphotons, plotted in Figure 3(d). The measured (red) and calculated (black) curves\nmatch very well, with peak fidelities of 0.71\u00b10.02 and 0.73 in agreement (within\nerror). Next, we remove the effect of the fluctuating nuclear field, (dark grey curve),\nwhich improves the peak fidelity significantly from 0.73 to 0.82. In addition, the time\nover which entangled light is emitted, defined by fidelities>0.5, is significantly\nextended from 1.0 ns to 1.8 ns, as the damping effect described above is removed.\n\nFinally, we remove the effect of detector jitter (light grey curve) to reveal an\nunderlying fidelity of 0.9 for this particular device, limited only by the dark counts\nand background light, which define the parameter k. Attempts to increase k by better\nspectral and spatial filtering of quantum dot light could improve the fidelity further.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the fidelity of entangled photons emitted by\nquantum dots is limited by coherent interactions of excitons with nuclei, presence of\nbackground light, and detector jitter, and not by any intrinsic decoherence. Improved\nmeasurement techniques are expected to eliminate the time-averaging effects that lead\nto apparent reduction in the entanglement fidelity, and allow enhanced fidelities to be\nmeasured for the same quantum dot source. The high inherent entanglement fidelity in\nquantum dot based ELEDs combined with the practical advantages of an electrically\ndriven semiconductor device make such entangled light sources very promising for\nfuture quantum information applications.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to acknowledge funding for this work from the EPSRC, QIPIRC,\nQAP, Q-ESSENCE, NanoSci-ERA and Spin-Optronics ITN.
