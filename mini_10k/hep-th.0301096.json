For second-class constraint\nsystem, however, there are under unfavorable circumstances in finding canonically conjugate pairs since the resulting Dirac brackets may be in general\nfield-dependent and/or nonlocal, and have a serious ordering problem between field operators. On the other hand, the quantization of first-class\nconstraint system [2, 3] has been well appreciated in a gauge invariant manner preserving Becci-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry [4]. Therefore, if secondclass constraint system can be converted into first-class one using auxiliary\ndegrees of freedom to extend a phase space, we do not actually need to define Dirac brackets and then the remaining quantization program follows the\nmethod of Ref. [2, 3, 4]. This procedure has been established by Batalin,\nFradkin, and Tyutin (BFT) [5, 6] and extensively studied in the canonical formalism for various models including massive gauge fields [7], spontaneously\nbroken gauge theories [8], SU(2)/SU(3) Skyrmion models [9], non-linear\nsigma models [10], noncommutative systems [11], and many others [12]. The\nBFT embedding formalism has been also widely applied to obtain the WessZumino (WZ) actions [13] showing that original theory can be regarded as a\ngauge-fixed version of extended gauge system, while verifying dual equivalent\ndescriptions [14] in particular gauges from the phase space partition function\ncorresponding to the BFT embedded involutive Hamiltonian.\nOn the other hand, antisymmetric tensor fields appearing first as a mediator of the interaction [15] have been much interested in as an alternative of\nthe Higgs mechanism without residual Higgs scalar [16, 17]. With the topologically interacting terms of the form B \u2227 F , this mechanism is considered\ngeneric in string phenomenology [18]. Moreover, various dual descriptions between different models have been widely studied where antisymmetric tensor\nfields play an important role in realization of dualities [19, 20]. In particular,\nseveral years ago Banerjee and Banerjee had studied a master Lagrangian\n[21] which is a first order massive spin-one theory involving antisymmetric\ntensor fields in order to show the dual equivalence of the Proca model and\nthe massive Kalb-Ramond model within a path integral framework. Recently, Harikumar and Sivakumar [22] have elaborated on the Lagrangian\nthrough the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian embedding technique, and have\n1\n\n\fshown that the embedded theory with appropriate gauge fixing is equivalent\nto the B \u2227 F theory on the level of Hamiltonian. The Lagrangian regarded\nas a topologically massive theory has interesting constraint structure related\nto the topological coupling term as well as the gauge symmetry breaking\nmass term. As results, the second-class constraints appears from two different origins: One comes from the explicit gauge symmetry breaking mass\nterm, and the other from the topological coupling term. Since this theory\nhave been studied by a reduction of the set of constraints through FaddeevJackiw method [23], there still remains to be clarified the role of auxiliary\nfields, which are originated from the topological interaction term.\nIn the present paper, we shall fully apply the BFT method to the topologically massive theory with one- and two-form gauge fields. As results, we\nwill explicitly show that auxiliary fields in part for the BFT embedding are\nnothing but the well-known St\u00fcckelberg fields on one hand, and find a new\ntype of WZ action [26] composed of the remaining auxiliary fields, which are\noriginated from symplectic structure of the model on the other hand. We\nalso clarify the underlying constraint structure concerning irreducible and\nreducible constraints.\nIn section 2, we newly construct the constraint structure of this model,\nwhich is much simpler than that of the previous work [22] due to the absence of derivatives in their Poisson brackets. In section 3, we carry out\nthe complete BFT embedding of the theory which has local gauge symmetry\nsupplemented with other: Local gauge symmetry is recovered from explicitly\ngauge symmetry breaking mass terms and the other comes from underlying\nsymplectic structure of topological term. In section 4, by identifying new\nauxiliary degrees of freedom with St\u00fcckelberg vector fields and new type\nof WZ fields, we obtain simultaneously the St\u00fcckelberg Lagrangian related\nto the explicit gauge breaking mass terms and a new type of WZ action\nwith novel symmetry, which is originated from the symplectic structure of\nthe theory. In section 5, we revisit the original theory making use of gauging technique to show the equivalence of the gauged Lagrangian and the\nSt\u00fcckelberg Lagrangian on the constraint surface. Conclusion is devoted in\nsection 6.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nConstraint Structure of Topologically Massive Theory\n\nIn this section, we consider topologically massive theory with one- and twoform fields, described by the following first order Lagrangian [21, 22]:\n1\n1\n1\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 B \u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03c1 A\u03c3 .\n(2.1)\nL = \u2212 B\u03bc\u03bd B \u03bc\u03bd + A\u03bc A\u03bc +\n4\n2\n2m\nFrom the symmetrized form of the Lagrangian of\n1\n1\n1\n1\nL = \u2212 B\u03bc\u03bd B \u03bc\u03bd + A\u03bc A\u03bc +\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 B \u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03c1 A\u03c3 \u2212\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u2202 \u03bc B \u03bd\u03c1 A\u03c3 , (2.2)\n4\n2\n4m\n4m\nwe read the canonical momenta as\n1\n\u03c00 = 0, \u03c0i =\n\u01ebijk B jk ,\n4m\n1\n\u01ebijk Ak ,\n(2.3)\n\u03c00i = 0, \u03c0ij = \u2212\n2m\nwhere we denote \u01eb0ijk = \u01ebijk and \u01eb123 = +1. Then, the primary Hamiltonian\nyields\nHp = Hc + \u03bb0 \u03c00 + \u03bbi \u03a9i + \u03a30i \u03c00i + \u03a3ij \u03a9ij\n(2.4)\nwith the Lagrange multipliers \u03bb0 , \u03bbi , \u03a30i , and \u03a3ij , where the canonical Hamiltonian is given by\n1\n1\n1\n1\nHc =\nBij B ij \u2212 Ai Ai + B0i B 0i \u2212 A0 A0\n4\n2\n2\n2\n1 0 ijk\n1 ijk\n\u01eb B0i \u2202j Ak \u2212\nA \u01eb \u2202i Bjk ,\n(2.5)\n\u2212\nm\n2m\nand the primary constraints are defined as\n1\n\u03c00 \u2248 0, \u03a9i \u2261 \u03c0i \u2212\n\u01ebijk B jk \u2248 0,\n4m\n1\n\u03c00i \u2248 0, \u03a9ij \u2261 \u03c0ij +\n\u01ebijk Ak \u2248 0.\n(2.6)\n2m\nFrom the time stability conditions of the constraints \u03c00 and \u03c00i , we have\nobtained two additional secondary constraints as\n1 ijk\n\u01eb \u2202i Bjk \u2248 0,\n\u039b \u2261 \u03c0\u03070 = {\u03c00 , Hp } = A0 +\n2m\n1\n\u039bi \u2261 \u03c0\u03070i = {\u03c00i , Hp } = \u2212B0i + \u01ebijk \u2202 j Ak \u2248 0,\n(2.7)\nm\n3\n\n\fand the constraints \u03a9i , \u03a9ij fix the Lagrange multipliers \u03a3ij , \u03bbi , respectively.\nThe other Lagrange multipliers \u03bb0 , \u03a30i are also determined by requiring\nconsistency of the secondary constraints \u039b, \u039bi with the equations of motion,\nand thus no further new constraints are generated. As a result, the Poisson\nbrackets of all the constraints (2.6) and (2.7) are obtained as\n{\u03c00 , \u039b} = \u2212\u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n{\u03c00i , \u039bj } = \u03b4ij \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n1\n{\u03a9i , \u03a9jk } = \u2212 \u01ebijk \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\nm\n1\n\u01ebijk \u2202xk \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n{\u03a9i , \u039bj } =\nm\n1\n\u01ebijk \u2202xk \u03b4(x \u2212 y)\n{\u03a9ij , \u039b} =\nm\n\n(2.8)\n\nshowing that the constraint structure of the topologically massive theory be\nfully second-class.\nNow, instead of reducing the constraints \u03a9i , \u03a9ij strongly by making use\nof Faddeev-Jackiw scheme [23] and considering only gauge degrees of freedom\nas done in the previous work [22], we will keep the full set of the constraints\n(2.6) and (2.7). In order for studying the whole constraints efficiently, we\nfurther need to modify the constraints (2.7) as\n\u039b\u2032 \u2261 \u2202 i \u03a9i + \u039b\n= \u2202 i \u03c0i + A0 +\n\n1 ijk\n\u01eb \u2202i Bjk \u2248 0,\n4m\n\n\u039b\u2032i \u2261 \u2202 j \u03a9ij \u2212 \u039bi\n= \u2202 j \u03c0ij + B0i \u2212\n\n1\n\u01ebijk \u2202 j Ak \u2248 0,\n2m\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhich are equivalent to the original ones, \u039b, \u039bi on the constraint surface.\nThen, the set of these new constraints makes the constraint algebra (2.8)\nmuch simpler and concise as\n{\u03c00 , \u039b\u2032 } = \u2212\u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n{\u03c00i , \u039b\u2032j } = \u03b4ij \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n1\n{\u03a9i , \u03a9jk } = \u2212 \u01ebijk \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\nm\n4\n\n(2.10)\n\n\fwhile the others identically vanish4 .\nAs results, we have obtained the fully second-class constraints (2.6) and\n(2.9) for the first order Lagrangian of the topologically massive theory. Notice\nthat this new algebra contains no derivatives unlikely in Eq. (2.8) as well\nas vanishing brackets between the constraints \u03a9i , \u03a9ij and \u039b, \u039bi . In fact,\ndue to the absence of the derivatives in the new Poisson brackets, one can\neasily convert the second-class constraints (2.6) and (2.9) into corresponding\nfirst-class ones making use of the BFT embedding technique, which we will\nexplicitly study in the next section. If we use the constraint algebra as it\nstands in Eq. (2.8) containing the derivatives, BFT embedded constraints\nand fields may have non-local expressions which would make the quantization\nintractable.\nOn the other hand, making use of the definition of the Dirac brackets as\n{A(x), B(y)}DB = {A(x), B(y)}P B\n\u2212\n\nZ\n\ndwdz{A(x), \u03c6\u03b1 (w)}C \u03b1\u03b2 (w, z){\u03c6\u03b2 (z), B(y)},\n\nwhere the matrix C \u03b1\u03b2 is an inverse of {\u03c6\u03b1 (x), \u03c6\u03b2 (y)} = C\u03b1\u03b2 (x, y) along with\nthe constraints denoted by \u03c6\u03b1 = (\u03c00 , \u03c00i , \u039b, \u039bi , \u03a9i , \u03a9ij ), we have obtained the\nfollowing non-vanishing Dirac Brackets\n{A0 (x), Ai (y)}D = \u2202xi \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n1\n{A0 (x), \u03c0ij (y)}D = \u2212\n\u01ebijk \u2202xk \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n2m\n1 i\n\u03b4 \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n{Ai (x), \u03c0j (y)}D =\n2 j\n{Ai (x), B jk (y)}D = \u2212m\u01ebijk \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n1\n\u01ebijk \u2202xk \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n{\u03c0i (x), B0j (y)}D =\n2m\n1\n{\u03c0i (x), \u03c0jk (y)}D =\n\u01ebijk \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n4m\n{B 0i (x), B jk (y)}D = (\u03b4 ij \u2202xk \u2212 \u03b4 ik \u2202xj )\u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n1 i j\n(\u03b4k \u03b4l \u2212 \u03b4kj \u03b4li )\u03b4(x \u2212 y)\n{B ij (x), \u03c0kl (y)}D =\n2\n4\n\nFrom now on, we will omit the prime symbols on the constraints \u039b, \u039bi\n\n5\n\n(2.11)\n\n\fin order to compare with the results obtained from the BFT embedding which\nautomatically leads to the Dirac brackets at the level of Poisson brackets in\nthe extended phase space.\nIt seems appropriate to comment on the constraints \u03a9i , and \u03a9ij . These\nconstraints come from the topological term in the Lagrangian (2.1). In the\nscheme of Faddeev-Jackiw quantization [23] which deals with only the dynamical degrees of freedom, these could be eliminated from the start while\nmodifying other brackets of the fields. Harikumar and Sivakumar [22] has\nworked in this direction. However, in the present paper, we will keep these\nconstraints with the others as it stands and embed the whole constraints\ninto much larger phase space than their phase space, which we mean complete BFT embedding. This will give a new type of WZ action with novel\nsymmetry as well as the St\u00fcckelberg action with the usual gauge symmetry.\n\n3\n\nComplete BFT Hamiltonian Embedding\n\nSince we know how to quantize first-class constraint system very well while\nsecond-class system may have serious ordering and/or non-local problems, it\nis preferred to deal with first-class constraint system. The BFT embedding\nprescription makes in a systematic way second-class constraint Hamiltonian\nsystem into corresponding first-class one. In order for that purpose, we introduce auxiliary fields having involutive relations in which not only modified\nnew constraints in the enlarged space are strongly vanishing with each other\nbut also they have vanishing Poisson brackets, not the Dirac brackets, with\nphysical quantities such as Hamiltonian and fields themselves. Here, 'physical' means gauge invariant since resulting modified new quantities would be\nfirst-class by construction. Practically, with the aid of auxiliary fields \u03a6\u03b1 ,\none for each constraint, satisfying with\n{\u03a6\u03b1 (x), \u03a6\u03b2 (y)} = \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 (x, y),\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhile vanishing with the original fields, we construct the involutive relations\nas\n{\u03c6\u0303\u03b1 (x), \u03c6\u0303\u03b2 (y)} = 0,\n{\u03c6\u0303\u03b1 (x), F\u0303 (y)} = 0,\n6\n\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n\n\fwhere the new constraints \u03c6\u0303\u03b1 , and physical quantities F\u0303 are given by \u03c6\u0303\u03b1 \u223c\nP\nP\n\u03c6\u03b1 + n=1 (\u03a6\u03b1 )n , and F\u0303 \u223c F + n=1 (\u03a6\u03b1 )n , respectively, with appropriate\ncoefficients in front of (\u03a6\u03b1 )n . In case we set the auxiliary fields \u03a6\u03b1 to be\nzero, those quantities are reduced to the original ones, i.e., \u03c6\u0303\u03b1 |\u03a6\u03b1 =0 = \u03c6\u03b1\n(or, F\u0303 |\u03a6\u03b1 =0 = F ).\nNow, let us explicitly solve the involutive relations, Eqs. (3.2) and (3.3),\nby making use of the following Ansatz of\n\u03c6(1)\n\u03b1 (x) =\n\nZ\n\ndy X\u03b1\u03b2 (x, y)\u03a6\u03b2 (y).\n\n(3.4)\n\nInserting the Ansatz to the involutive relations between the constraints (3.2),\nwe obtain in the zeroth order of the auxiliary fields \u03a6\u03b1 as\n(1)\n\n0 = {\u03c6\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b2 }O + {\u03c6(1)\n\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b2 } \u03a6\n= C\u03b1\u03b2 (x, y) +\n\nZ\n\ndwdz X\u03b1\u03b3 (x, w)\u03c9 \u03b3\u03b4 (w, z)X\u03b4\u03b2 (z, y),\n\n(3.5)\n\nand in the first order of \u03a6\u03b1 as\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n(2)\n{\u03c6\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b2 }O + {\u03c6(1)\n\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b2 }O + {\u03c6\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b2 }\u03a6 + {\u03c6\u03b1 , \u03c6\u03b2 }\u03a6 = 0,\n\n(3.6)\n\nand so on. Here, the subscript O(or, \u03a6) denotes the Poisson bracket with\nrespect to the original variables (q, p)(or, the auxiliary fields, \u03a6). Then, by\n(2)\nknowing the first order correction \u03c6(1)\n\u03b1 , we can obtain the next order \u03c6\u03b1\nfrom Eq. (3.6), and these procedure continue iteratively until we determine\ninvolutive new constraints completely.\nThrough the similar steps as above, we can also get the first order correction for physical quantity as\nF\n\n(1)\n\n(x) = \u2212\n\nZ\n\ndydzdw \u03a6\u03b1 (x)\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 (x, y)X \u03b2\u03b3 (y, z){\u03c6\u03b3 (z), A(w)},\n\n(3.7)\n\nin the zeroth order of the auxiliary fields \u03a6\u03b1 . This correction has been\nobtained explicitly from the ansatz (3.4) and the involutive relation (3.3).\nAlso, higher order corrections F (n) (n \u2265 2) can be obtained iteratively from\nEq. (3.3) to find completely involutive quantities out along with the modified\nnew constraints.\nIt is appropriate to comment on the choice of \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 and X\u03b1\u03b2 which may be\nthe functions of the original variables. Although there are no known criteria\n7\n\n\fto best choice \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 and X\u03b1\u03b2 , but final forms of the modified constraints and\nthe physical quantities depend on what the matrix elements of \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 and X\u03b1\u03b2\nare. Nevertheless, among different expressions of constraints and physical\nquantities obtained from choosing any set of \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 and X\u03b1\u03b2 , they are related\nto each other with canonical transformations.\nNow return to our model. By following the above BFT prescription, we\nintroduce auxiliary fields paired as (\u03b8, \u03c0\u03b8 ), (Qi , Pi ), and (\u03a6i , \u03a6jk ):\n\u03a6\u03b1 = (\u03b8, Qi , \u03c0\u03b8 , P i , \u03a6i , \u03a6ij ),\nwhich correspond to the constraints \u03c6\u03b1 = (\u03c00 , \u03c00i , \u039b, \u039bi , \u03a9i , \u03a9ij ), respectively.\nWithout any loss of generality, let us for simplicity make a proper choice for\nthe auxiliary fields canonically conjugated as follows\n\uf8eb\n\n{\u03a6\u03b1 (x), \u03a6\u03b2 (y)} = \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 (x, y) =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0 \u2212\u03b4 ij\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1 0\n0\n0\n0 \u03b4 ij\n0\n0\n0 0\n0\n0\n0 0\n0\n0\n0 0\n0\n\u01ebijk\n0 0 \u2212\u01ebijk 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \u03b4(x \u2212 y).\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(3.8)\nHere, note that the auxiliary fields \u03a6i , \u03a6ij in the last two columns is explicitly\ngiven by\n{\u03a6i (x), \u03a6jk (y)} = \u01ebijk \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhich choice makes it possible to embed the constraints originated from the\ntopological term. With the above choice of \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2 , we solve the Eq. (3.5) and\nfind a simple solution as\n\uf8eb\n\nX\u03b1\u03b2 (x, y) =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1 0\n0 \u03b4 ij\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n\n0 0\n0\n0 0\n0\n1 0\n0\n0 \u03b4 ij\n0\n0 0 I3\u00d73\n0 0\n0\n\nwhere I3\u00d73 denotes a 3 \u00d7 3 identity matrix.\n8\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\nI\nm 3\u00d73\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 \u03b4(x \u2212 y),\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(3.10)\n\n\fAs results, we have obtained the strongly involutive new constraints from\nEq.

Moreover,\nfrom the inverse matrix \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 and X \u03b1\u03b2 and the solution of the physical fields\n(3.7), we have also gotten the strongly involutive physical fields [25] as follows\nAe0 = A0 + \u03c0\u03b8 ,\n\n1\nAei = Ai + \u2202 i \u03b8 \u2212 \u01ebijk \u03a6jk ,\n2\n\u03c0e0 = \u03c00 + \u03b8,\n1\n1\n\u01ebijk \u2202 j Qk + \u03a6i ,\n\u03c0ei = \u03c0i \u2212\n2m\n2\ne 0i = B 0i + P i ,\nB\ne ij = B ij \u2212 (\u2202 i Qj \u2212 \u2202 j Qi ) + m\u01ebijk \u03a6 ,\nB\nk\n\u03c0e0i = \u03c00i + Qi ,\n1\n1\n\u01ebijk \u2202 k \u03b8 +\n\u03a6ij\n\u03c0eij = \u03c0ij \u2212\n2m\n2m\n\n(3.12)\n\nsatisfying the involutive relation (3.3). Note that all the physical fields are\nterminated in the first order of the auxiliary fields of the BFT embedding\nsequence and there are no higher order contributions. One can easily checked\nthat the Poisson brackets of Eq. (3.12) in the extended phase space give\nexactly the same Dirac brackets in the original phase space as given in Eq.\n(2.11) as they should be.\nOn the other hand, canonical Hamiltonian in the extended phase space\ncan be obtained either by solving the strongly involutive relation (3.3) in\nreplacement of F\u0303 with a Hamiltonian function or by using the physical fields\n(3.12) in the canonical Hamiltonian (2.5) written by the tilde fields. Since\nthese methods of obtaining canonical Hamiltonian are known to be equivalent\nto each other on the constraint surface, which are weakly equivalent, we will\n9\n\n\ffollow the latter approach. Then, the canonical Hamiltonian (2.5) is simply\nwritten in the extended phase space as follows\n1\n1\n1\n(Bij \u2212 Qij )2 + m\u01ebijk (B ij \u2212 Qij )\u03a6k \u2212 m2 \u03a6i \u03a6i\n4\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n(Ai + \u2202i \u03b8)2 + \u01ebijk (Ai + \u2202 i \u03b8)\u03a6jk + \u03a6ij \u03a6ij\n\u2212\n2\n2\n4\n1\n1\n1\n+\n(B0i + Pi )2 \u2212 \u01ebijk (B 0i + P i )\u2202 j Ak \u2212 (B0i + Pi )\u2202j \u03a6ij\n2\nm\nm\n1\n1\n(A0 + \u03c0\u03b8 )2 \u2212\n(A0 + \u03c0\u03b8 )\u01ebijk \u2202 i B jk + (A0 + \u03c0\u03b8 )\u2202i \u03a6i , (3.13)\n\u2212\n2\n2m\n\nf =\nH\nc\n\nwhere Qij denote Qij = \u2202i Qj \u2212 \u2202j Qi .

On the other hand,\nthe gauge parameters \u01ebiA , \u01ebij\nB are obtained from the embedded topological\nconstraints \u03a9\u0303i , \u03a9\u0303ij with their WZ fields \u03a6i , \u03a6ij resulting in the new type\nof WZ Lagrangian. It is easy to check that the total action (4.6) is exactly\ninvariant under those gauge transformation. As results, we have explicitly\nobtained the usual gauge invariant St\u00fcckelberg Lagrangian LSt for the massive one- and two-form fields, and a new type of the WZ Lagrangian LN W Z\nincluding the WZ fields, \u03a6i , \u03a6ij .\nIt is appropriate to comment that in the generating functional (4.5) there\nexists the delta functional of a variable Q0 which transforms as \u03b4Q0 = \u01eb0B\nas shown above. We have introduced this new field to make the final Lagrangian manifestly covariant. Even without this Q0 field, we can show\nthat the resulting Lagrangian successfully reproduces all the BFT embedded\nconstraint structure as in the section 3. However, it fails to have manifest\ncovariance. According to the usage of the Hamiltonian formulation, the constraint structure of the Lagrangian (2.1) is called irreducible, in other words,\nthe constraints are linearly independent. On the other hand, the constraint\nstructure of the St\u00fcckelberg Lagrangian (4.7) is reducible, i.e., there is a\nredundant relation among the constraints. In fact, we have introduced the\nnew variable Q0 in order for keeping the manifest covariance, while giving\nup the irreducible property between the constraints.\nOn the other hand, the new type of the WZ action is related to the symplectic constraints, \u03a9i , \u03a9ij , of the Lagrangian (2.1), which are now converted\ninto the first-class constraints. This seemingly non-covariant form of the Lagrangian LN W Z comes from the introduction of the auxiliary fields \u03a6i , \u03a6ij as\ngiven by Eq. (3.9) where the distinction between the fields and the momenta\nis useless. In other words, they look like another Dirac brackets, and in order\n13\n\n\ffor embedding this symplectic structure fully and getting a completely covariant action such as the symplectic structure free theory, we may introduce\ninfinite numbers of auxiliary fields as discussed in Ref. [27].\n\n4.2\n\nVarious Gauge Fixings\n\nNow, let us consider various gauge fixings in the path integral (4.3). First,\nunitary gauge fixings: by fixing unitary gauge means that all the auxiliary\nfields are set to be zero, \u03a6\u03b1 = 0, and it is easy task to check that we can\nrecover the original Lagrangian (2.1) in the unitary gauge as follows\nZ=\n\nZ\n\nDA\u03bc DB \u03bc\u03bd eiS ,\n\n(4.15)\n\nwith the action S in Eq. (2.1). Furthermore, it is easy to see that the integration over B \u03bc\u03bd yields the Proca action, while the integration over A\u03bc\nKalb-Ramond action. Therefore, we have reconfirmed the well-known result that the action (2.1) is nothing but a master action leading to a dual\ndescription, i.e., they have a common origin.\nNext, let us consider appropriate gauge fixings showing that the topologically massive theory of first order with the one- and two-form fields is\nequivalent to the B \u2227 F theory. From the generating functional (4.3), we\nfirst eliminate the auxiliary fields \u03a6i = 0, \u03a6ij = 0 by fixing the unitary gauge\nin part. Then, the resulting Lagrangian is simply the St\u00fcckelberg LSt . Next,\nwe consider the following gauge fixings:\n\u2202i Qi = 0,\n\u2202i B 0i = 0,\n1\n\u01ebijk \u2202 j B 0k = 0,\nm\n1\n\u2261 Bij \u2212 \u01ebijk \u2202 k A0 = 0.\nm\n\n\u03c7i \u2261 Ai \u2212\n\u03c7ij\n\n(4.16)\n\nThe momenta, \u03c0i , \u03c0ij , \u03c00 , \u03c00i , and Q0 fields are integrated out along with\ne ), \u03b4(\u03a9\ne ), \u03b4(\u03c0\ne 0 ), \u03b4(\u03c0\ne 0i ), and \u03b4(Q0 ), respectively.

Thus, the gauged massive theory of first order\nLagrangian (2.1) is described by\n1\n1\n1\nLG = \u2212 (B\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Q\u03bc\u03bd )2 + (A\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u03b8)2 +\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 (B \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Q\u03bc\u03bd )\u2202 \u03c1 (A\u03c3 + \u2202 \u03c3 \u03b8),\n4\n2\n2m\n(5.2)\nwhich is invariant under the gauge transformations of\n\u03b4A\u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc \u01eb, \u03b4\u03b8 = \u2212\u01eb, \u03b4B \u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bc \u01eb\u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd \u01eb\u03bc , \u03b4Q\u03bc = \u01eb\u03bc .\n\n(5.3)\n\nHere, we have redefined the gauge parameters as \u01ebA = \u2212\u01eb, \u01eb\u03bcB = \u01eb\u03bc in which\nexpression is usually seen in the literature and take \u01ebiA = \u01ebij\nB = 0 in the\nextended gauge symmetries (4.14) in order to focus mainly on the gauging\ntechnique. Note that as you already know through the note in the previous\nsections by taking \u01eb\u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc \u03bb, \u03b4B \u03bc\u03bd have vanished clearly indicating that the\nconstraints are not all independent, i.e., reducible.\nIn order for comparing this action with the St\u00fcckelberg Lagrangian LSt\nin view of constraint structure, we do partial integration of the terms G0 \u03b8\u0307,\nH0i Q\u0307i to \u01200 \u03b8, \u2212\u1e220i Qi , respectively, in the gauged Lagrangian (5.2). Then,\nthe canonical momenta are obtained as\n\u03c00 = \u2212\u03b8,\n\n\u03c0i =\n16\n\n1\n\u01ebijk B jk ,\n4m\n\n\f\u03c00i = \u2212Qi ,\nPi = Qi0 ,\n\n1\n\u01ebijk Ak ,\n2m\nP0 = 0,\n\u03c0\u03b8 = \u03b8\u0307,\n\u03c0ij = \u2212\n\n(5.4)\n\nfrom which we have the primary constraints as\n\u03a30 \u2261 \u03c00 + \u03b8 \u2248 0,\n\u03a3i \u2261 \u03c00i + Qi \u2248 0,\n1\n\u03a9i \u2261 \u03c0i \u2212\n\u01ebijk B jk \u2248 0,\n4m\n1\n\u01ebijk Ak \u2248 0,\n\u03a9ij \u2261 \u03c0ij +\n2m\nP0 \u2248 0.\n\n(5.5)\n\nWe also get the canonical Hamiltonian as\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n(Bij \u2212 Qij )2 \u2212 (Ai + \u2202i \u03b8)2 + B0i B 0i \u2212 Pi P i \u2212 A0 A0\nHc =\n4\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1 2\n\u03c0 + (Pi + B0i )\u2202 i Q0 \u2212 \u01ebijk B 0i \u2202 j Ak \u2212\nA0 \u01ebijk \u2202 i B jk . (5.6)\n+\n2 \u03b8\nm\n2m\nFrom the time stability conditions of the primary constraints with the canonical Hamiltonian, there are additional secondary constraints as follows\nd\n\u2206 \u2261\nP0 = \u2202 i (Pi + B0i ) \u2248 0,\ndt\n1\nd\n\u03a30 = A0 +\n\u01ebijk \u2202 i B jk + \u03c0\u03b8 \u2248 0,\n\u039b \u2261\ndt\n2m\nd\n1\n\u039bi \u2261\n\u03a3i = \u2212B0i + \u01ebijk \u2202 j Ak \u2212 Pi \u2248 0.\n(5.7)\ndt\nm\nIt seems appropriate to comment on the linear independence of the constraints. The combination of the above constraints \u2206, \u039bi vanishes i.e.,\n\u2206 + \u2202 i \u039bi = 0, which indicates again that the whole constraints are not\nlinearly independent, i.e., reducible.\nFinally, making use of the above constraints, we can obtain the following\nHamiltonian\n1\n1\n1\n1\n(Bij \u2212 Qij )2 \u2212 (Ai + \u2202i \u03b8)2 + (B0i + Pi )2 \u2212 \u01ebijk (B 0i + P i )\u2202 j Ak\nHc =\n4\n2\n2\nm\n1\n1\n2\ni jk\n\u2212\n(A0 + \u03c0\u03b8 ) \u2212\n(A0 + \u03c0\u03b8 )\u01ebijk \u2202 B + \u03c0\u03b8 \u03a9 + (P i + \u2202 i Q0 )\u03a9i\n2\n2m\nf\u2032 ,\n\u2248 H\n(5.8)\nc\n17\n\n\ff\u2032 is given in Eq. (3.13). This shows the equivalence of the gauged\nwhere H\nc\nLagrangian (5.2) and the St\u00fcckelberg Lagrangian (4.7) on the constraint\nsurface.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have applied the complete BFT method to the massive\ntheory with one- and two-form fields. We have newly analyzed the full set\nof constraint structure of the model having no derivatives in the Poisson\nbrackets, which is much simpler than that of the previous work [22] and\nthus makes it possible to apply the BFT embedding further. Then, we have\nexplicitly carried out the complete BFT embedding of the theory including\nthe gauge symmetry breaking terms and the topological term, which was not\ngauge invariant. Exploiting the complete BFT embedding we have obtained\nthe gauge invariant Lagrangian corresponding to the first class Hamiltonian,\nand by identifying the auxiliary fields with the St\u00fcckelberg vector fields and\nnew type of WZ fields, we have shown simultaneously the St\u00fcckelberg Lagrangian related to the explicit gauge breaking mass term and the new type\nof WZ action to topological term having novel symmetry. Furthermore, by\nanalyzing the gauged version of the theory we have also shown that the usual\nSt\u00fcckelberg Lagrangian is exactly equivalent to the BFT embedded one on\nthe constraint space after taking the unitary gauge \u03a6i = 0, \u03a6ij = 0.\n\nThe work of YWK was supported by the Korea Research Foundation,\nGrant No. KRF-2002-075-C00007.\n\nReferences\n[1] P.
