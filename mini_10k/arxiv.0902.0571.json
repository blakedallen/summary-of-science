Ancient, co-eval, equidistant, and apparently\nmono-metallic, GCs give the appearance of being elegantly\nsimple aggregates of stars. Behind this \"mask of simplicity\"\nthough, lurks perplexing observations which have defied explanation for several decades.\nFirst, each well-studied cluster to date shows starto-star abundance variations of the light elements C, N,\nO, Na, Mg, and Al (Kraft 1994; Gratton et al. 2004, and\nreferences therein), not shared by field stars with similar metallicities (Gratton et al. 2000). These variations follow a common pattern with C-N, O-Na, and Mg-Al all\nanti-correlated (e.g Kraft et al. 1993; Grundahl et al. 2002;\nCohen et al. 2002; Yong et al. 2003; Sneden et al. 2004;\nYong et al. 2005; Cohen & Mel\u00e9ndez 2005; Carretta et al.\n2006; Gratton et al. 2007; Marino et al. 2008). Importantly,\nthe sum of C+N+O is observed to be approximately constant (e.g. Ivans et al. 1999; Carretta et al. 2005). More-\n\nover, Smith et al. (2005) noted that stars in one of the\nGalactic globular clusters, NGC 6121, showed evidence for\na Na-F anti-correlation, whereas Pasquini et al. (2005) and\nBonifacio et al. (2007) found a Na-Li anti-correlation in\nNGC 6752 and 47 Tucanae, respectively. The abundances\nof Si, Ca, the iron-peak (e.g., Fe, Ni, and Cu) and neutroncapture elements (e.g., Ba, La, Eu) do not show the same\nstar-to-star scatter, nor do they vary with the light elements\n(Gratton et al. 2004; James et al. 2004; Yong et al. 2006b,\n2008). The most important exception to this is the most\nmassive cluster \u03c9 Centauri, that shows both, a spread in\nage and [Fe/H], and a rise in s-process element abundances\nwith increasing [Fe/H]. Evidence for \u03c9 Cen suggests it\nmay have an extragalactic origin (e.g. Majewski et al. 2000;\nSmith et al. 2000; Gnedin et al. 2002; Bekki & Freeman\n2003; Romano et al. 2007; Marcolini et al. 2007).\nThe above abundance trends have been found for\nstars in all evolutionary phases, from the main-sequence\nturn-off through to the tip of the first giant branch,\nwhich has lent support to the \"self-pollution\" hypothesis\n\n\f2\n\nA. Marcolini et al.\n\n(Cottrell & Da Costa 1981; Dantona et al. 1983). This is in\ncontrast to deep mixing, where the abundance anomalies are\nproduced by internal mixing during the ascent of the giant\nbranch, after the first dredge-up (Sweigart & Mengel 1979;\nPinsonneault 1997; Charbonnel 1994). Further evidence for\nself-pollution comes from a lack of variation in the O-Na and\nMg-Al anti-correlations with luminosity as the stars ascend\nthe first giant branch.\nAccording to the self-pollution scenario a previous\ngeneration of stars \"contaminated\" the atmospheres of\nstars observed today in GCs, or provided much of the\nmaterial from which those stars formed (e.g. Jehin et al.\n1998; Parmentier et al. 1999; Tsujimoto et al. 2007). The\nroughly constant [Fe/H] abundances in a given GC led\nto the assumption that the polluters were low-metallicity,\nintermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars,\nwith masses between \u223c 4 and 7 M\u2299 (D'Antona & Caloi\n2004; Bekki et al. 2007). The hot bottom burning experienced by these stars provides the hydrogen burning\nenvironment (at least qualitatively) that can alter the\nabundances of the light elements. Detailed AGB models have mostly failed to explain the observed abundance trends (Denissenkov & Herwig 2003; Fenner et al.\n2004; Cohen & Mel\u00e9ndez 2005; Karakas et al. 2006a),\nbut model uncertainties, including convection and mass\nloss, render predictions uncertain (Ventura & D'Antona\n2005a,b). Recently, slow-winds from rotating massive stars\n(Prantzos & Charbonnel 2006; Smith 2006; Decressin et al.\n2007) have also been proposed as another possible source of\nthe abundance anomalies.\nThe canonical AGB enrichment scenario consists of two\nstages in which the first stars to form are those pre-polluted\nby core collapse supernovae (SNe II), and have [O/Fe] \u223c 0.5\nand [Na/Fe] \u223c \u22120.1. After the first SNe II have driven away\nthe gas from the proto-cluster, gas polluted by AGB winds\nstarts to accumulate at the centre of the cluster and a second generation of stars with peculiar abundances can form.\nThese second-generation stars will have depleted F and O,\nalong with enhanced in N and Na with respect to the first\ngeneration. Variations to this scenario include (1) the AGB\nejecta-enriched gas is also accreted on to the surface of some\n(e.g., segregated) stars (Parmentier et al. 1999), and (2) the\nAGB pollution comes, not only from the first generation of\nstars, but also from all AGB stars of the satellite galaxy\nwhere the GC is forming (Bekki et al. 2007). The second\nassumption was made to allow for a larger reservoir of material for the formation of the second generation of stars\n(Bekki & Norris 2006), as if all AGB pollution comes from\nthe first generation of stars, is very difficult to explain the\nhigh fraction (as high as 50%) of peculiar-to-normal stars\nin GCs (e.g., D'Antona & Caloi 2004; D'Antona et al. 2005;\nCarretta et al. 2006; Piotto et al. 2007). The same results\ncan be achieved by assuming that the GCs were much more\nmassive in the past (by a factor of \u223c10-100\u00d7) and lost preferentially most (90-99%) of their first generation of stars\nthrough tidal interactions with the Milky Way (MW; e.g.\nD'Ercole et al. 2008).\nAnother way to solve the problems associated with\nthe AGB-\"pre-pollution\" scenario is to assume that the\npolluters were not AGB stars but Type Ia supernovae.\nMarcolini et al. (2006) suggested that the O-depleted stars\nobserved in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) as well as in\n\nthe peculiar globular cluster \u03c9 Cen (Marcolini et al. 2007)\ncan be explained if those stars were born in a small iron-rich\nvolume inhomogeneously polluted by a single SN Ia. The\nejecta of SNe Ia is very rich in Fe and extremely poor in O\n(compared to SNe II) thus stars forming in such confined\nregions would show very low values of [O/Fe] (usually up\nto \u223c \u22120.5). Dwarf galaxies, however, show a large spread\n(1.5 dex) of [Fe/H], hence it is not clear if this model is\napplicable to the problem of the abundance anomalies in\nmono-metallic GCs.\nIn this paper we present a GC chemical evolution\nmodel where all of the observed chemical peculiarities arise\nfrom the inhomogeneous pollution of a single SN Ia and\nintermediate-mass AGB stars. This pollution is mixed with\ngas that was pre-enriched by very low-metallicity SNe II.\nSince each of these so-called \"polluters\" precede the formation of the GC itself, we call this type of enrichment \"external pollution\" (according to Bekki et al. 2007) from the\nMilky Way (or host galaxy). When the first stars with peculiar abundances are forming, SNe II start to explode, selfpolluting the ISM and dispersing the inhomogeneous region.\nAs star formation proceeds, the abundances of the forming\nstars will move from \"peculiar\" to \"normal\", where normal\nin this context means stars with chemical properties typical\nof SNe II enrichment. Eventually, the SNe II explosions will\ncease any further star formation (SF) and the GC will evolve\npassively. In previous studies, SN Ia had been discarded as\npolluters because the [Fe/H] is essentially constant within a\ngiven GC, and SN Ia are efficient producers of iron. Nevertheless, we will show that our model is able to reproduce the\nobserved anti-correlations, while keeping the iron content of\nthe newly forming stars approximately constant.\nIn the following we test our scenario on a GC with a typical [O/Fe]-depletion pattern (on the order of \u223c \u22120.5), similar to to the well-studied cluster NGC 6752 ([Fe/H]=\u22121.56).\nIn addition we test our scenario on a more extreme case\nsuch as that of NGC 2808 ([Fe/H]=\u22121.15) and M 13\n([Fe/H]=\u22121.50) (Harris 1996), with [O/Fe]-depletions as\nlarge as 1 dex.\n\n2\n\nINITIAL CONDITIONS\n\nIt is generally assumed that GCs were assembled during the\nformation of the Milky Way halo (or their parent galaxy)\neven though their chemical properties differ from those halo\nfield stars of the same metallicity (e.g., Gratton et al. 2000;\nFreeman & Bland-Hawthorn 2002). It is likely that part, or\nall, of this difference can be traced to the very different conditions experienced by the respective systems e.g., deeper\npotential wells and the associated burst of SF.\nFollowing this framework, we assume that a typical GC\nforms initially within gas pre-enriched by field polluters such\nas SNe II, but also from SNe Ia and AGB stars associated\nwith (parent) halo star formation. However, due to the early\nstage of the formation of the halo (with respect to the rest of\nthe parent/Milky Way), SNe Ia and AGB stars are not important in shaping the mean chemical properties of the gas\nunless they are polluting it inhomogeneously (i.e., polluting\na small localized region). Thus, we assume that a typical GC\nwill form initially in a peculiar region of the halo that was\npre-polluted by SNe II, and in which the inhomogeneous pol-\n\n\fThe Chemical Evolution of Globular Clusters\nlution of a single SN Ia and intermediate-mass AGB stars is\nadded. In our model, all the chemical peculiarities observed\nin GC stars (i.e., O-depleted and Na-rich stars) which are\nnot shared by their field counterparts arise due to this peculiar localized inhomogeneous pollution.\nA schematic representation of how these initial conditions can be achieved is shown in Fig 1. According to\nour model, AGB material is deposited in the vicinity of a\nSNe Ia progenitor binary system. As the secondary explodes\nas a SN Ia and the supernovae remnant (SNR) expands, it\nwill collect this surrounding AGB material in its shell. The\nnumerical evolution of a radiative SNR has been analyzed\nin detail by Cioffi et al. (1988) and Thornton et al. (1998).\nThese studies found that for normal ambient gas density of\nn0 = 1 \u2212 10 cm\u22123 , the evolution of a SNR lasts for a few\nMyrs and that it reaches radius of \u223c50-90 pc (with the larger\nradii achieved for the smaller ambient gas densities). After\nradiating away most of its energy, the remnant will first stall,\nlose its identity and then collapse back (e.g. Slavin & Cox\n1992, ; approximately after Rmax /cs \u223c 5-9 Myr, assuming\nan ambient sound speed cs of 10 km s\u22121 ). The result of\nthis evolution will be a localized region of the halo, polluted\ninhomogeneously with SN Ia and AGB ejecta. These will\nbe the initial conditions of our model which we define as\nthe \"pre-peculiar enrichment\" scenario; we assume that the\nproto-GC starts forming stars in this peculiar region.\nRegions polluted inhomogeneously by SNe Ia arise naturally in the hydrodynamical simulations of dSphs chemical enrichment performed by Marcolini et al. (2006, 2008).\nCescutti (2008) also showed that a model which takes into\naccount inhomogeneous pollution is able to explain the observed spread in s- and r-process elements at low metallicities in the Galactic halo (see also Ishimaru & Wanajo\n1999; Argast et al. 2000). Since both the peak SNe Ia rate\n(Matteucci & Recchi 2001; Mannucci et al. 2006) and the\nlifetime of a low-metallicity 5 M\u2299 star (e.g., Schaller et al.\n1992; Karakas & Lattanzio 2007) are comparable (\u223c 80 \u2212\n100 Myr), this apparently peculiar enrichment scenario\nseems reasonable. Mannucci et al. (2006) proposed that half\nof the SNe Ia associated with a starburst should explode\non a timescale of the order \u223c 100 Myr. Marcolini et al.\n(2006,2008) have shown that even if a timescale greater than\n1\u20132 Gyr is needed to appreciate the cumulative effect of\nSNe Ia in the mean [\u03b1/Fe] ratio of spheroidal galaxies, the\neffect of a single SN Ia inhomogeneously polluting the ISM\ncould be important in the first few hundred Myrs (see also\nMarcolini et al. 2007, for and application of this scenario to\nthe particular case of \u03c9 Cen).\n\n3\n\nTWO-REGION MODEL\n\nOur model is based on what could be termed a \"two-region\"\nchemical evolution framework with a simplified prescription\nfor the chemical enrichment. As a first attempt to reproduce\nthe main chemical properties of GC stars, we do not follow\nthe ejecta of different mass progenitors, but we use IMFaveraged yields for both intermediate-mass AGB stars and\nSNe ejecta (see 4 for more detail). A sketch of the model\nis shown in Fig. 2, where the two regions \u2013 \"inner\" and\n\"external\" \u2013 are shown. The dark blue \"inner region\" in\nFig. 2 corresponds initially to the blue-green circle in the\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Schematic framework leading to the initial conditions\nrequired for our model: 1) low-metallicity 4\u20137 M\u2299 AGB stars\n(green dots) start polluting a particular region of the halo which\nhas been pre-enriched by SNe II; 2) a SN Ia explodes near this\nregion and during its expansion collects the AGB material in its\nshell; 3) the SN remnant radiates away its energy and the gas\nstarts re-collapsing, mixing the SN Ia ejecta with material from\nthe AGB stars; 4) the final result is a peculiar region in the Galactic halo, where on top of the mean pre-enrichment from early\nSNe II, the inhomogeneous contribution by a single SN Ia and a\nnumber of intermediate-mass AGB stars is added. These are our\nassumed initial conditions for proto-GC formation. Note that the\nlight-blue background volume (mainly polluted by early-SNe II)\nrepresents the mean chemical properties of the gas out of which\n\"normal\" field halo stars are formed.\n\nlast panel of Fig. 1 polluted inhomogeneously by a SN Ia\nand intermediate-mass AGB material; we will assume that\nthe SF related to the GC formation only takes place inside\nthis region. In the following, we will use the term \"inhomogeneous pollution\" to denote that this region has different chemical properties from the surrounding medium (note\nthat the chemical properties inside the inner region itself are\nhomogeneous).\nThe external region is simply described by the initial\nvalue of [Fe/H]ISM given in Table 1, which should reflect\nthe mean chemical properties of the proto-halo gas at the\nepoch of GC formation (enriched mainly by SNe II). The\ninner region is initially described by its radius (Rin i.e., the\ndegree to which the SN Ia was initially confined) and the\nmean chemical properties within, which is set by the number of 4\u22127 M\u2299 AGB stars, NAGB . Since most of the iron in\nthe inner region is provided by a single SN Ia the value of\nRin also defines the value of [Fe/H]in in the inner region. It\nis obvious that the localized iron-rich ejecta from the SN Ia\nwill substantially increase the value of [Fe/H] inside the inner region compared to the value in the external region,\nwhereas intermediate-mass AGB stars increase the N, Na,\nthe neutron-rich Mg isotopes and, possibly, Al. A glance at\nTable 1 shows that the inner region is a factor of \u223c 10 \u2212 100\nmore [Fe/H] rich than the external ISM and also has a similar higher overall metallicity. For this reason the first generation of stars will born with peculiar chemical properties:\nthey will be depleted in O and Mg (because of the single\n\n\f4\n\nA. Marcolini et al.\nTable 1.

Note that in canonical AGB self-pollution\nmodels (e.g. Fenner et al. 2004) these stars are the last to\nform. While a detailed discussion about each element will\nbe presented in the following sections, here we would like to\npoint out that, in general, the trend for SN Ia is to decrease\nthe [Xi /Fe] value when Xi is not (or negligibly) produced in\nintermediate-mass AGB stars (e.g., O and the elemental Mg\nabundance to a lesser extent). In the case when the elements\nare overproduced in AGB stars (e.g., N, Na and, possibly,\nAl), the effect of the SN Ia is to mitigate their enhancement.\nWe assume that the star formation takes place only inside the inner region. As the SF proceeds, massive stars\n(M\u2299 > 8 M\u2299 ) start exploding (as early as \u223c 3 \u2212 4 Myr\nafter the onset of star formation Schaller et al. 1992) as\nSNe II, ejecting freshly synthesized metals. We assume that\nafter each SN II explosion the inner region expands, driven\nby the explosions themselves, mixing the inner-region gas\nwith the surrounding ISM, while the SF is still proceedings\ninside this region. During the evolution, we simply assume\nthat the density remains constant and thus the mass inside\na fixed radius is M= 43 \u03c0\u03c10 R3 . For each of the proposed GC\nmodels we assume a density of \u03c10 = 4\u00d710\u221224 g cm\u22123 which,\nfor example, corresponds to a total mass of MISM \u2243 3 \u00d7 107\nM\u2299 inside a 500 pc radius sphere. Even if we were to assume a lower SF efficiency, there would still be more than\nsufficient gas to form a typical GC.\nThe simple relations governing the evolution after each\nSN II explosion can be summarized as:\nR(t + \u2206t) = R(t) \u00d7 fexp\n\n(1)\n\nXi (t + \u2206t) = Xi (t) + Xi (\u2206R) + hXi (SN II)i\n\n(2)\n\nwhere fexp is a constant governing the logarithmic expansion\nof the inner region after the explosion of every single SN II,\n\u2206t is the time interval between two successive SNe II explosions, Xi (t) is the mass fraction of an element X at a time\nt within the radius R(t), Xi (\u2206R) is the mass fraction of an\nelement X initially present in the corona R(t + 1)\u2212R(t), and\nfinally, hXi (SN II)i is the average mass fraction of element\nXi ejected by a single SN II (see Sec. 4). For example, the\nevolution of the [Fe/H] abundance in the inner region at a\ntime (t + \u2206t) (where \u2206t is the time between two successive\nSNe II) is computed by adding the Fe initially present in\nthis region at R(t) to the iron ejected by the newly exploding SNe II and to the iron initially present in the external\nregion R(t + \u2206t)\u2212R(t). This number is then divided by the\ntotal amount of hydrogen inside the new radius R(t + \u2206t).\nAll the other variables are calculated accordingly. We assume that this expansion is described by a logarithm law\nwith a free parameter (usually of the order of fexp \u223c 1.001)\n\nFigure 2. Schematic of the model. Initially, a localised volume\n(inner blue region) arises with the pollution from a single SN Ia\nand multiple intermediate-mass AGB stars. After a new generation of stars is born the associated SNe II begin to pollute and\nexpand the inner volume, as well as mix it with the surrounding\nlower-[Fe/H] interstellar medium.\n\nwhich fixes the increase of R(t) after each SN II explosion\n(i.e., R(t + \u2206t) =R(t) \u00d7 fexp ).\nIn Fig. 2 the dashed lines represent a sketch of the evolution of the inner region and the fact that the initial contribution of the single SN Ia (as well as AGB stars) is diluted during its expansion and the subsequent mixing with\nthe outer, lower metallicity ISM. As soon as the first SNe\nII start to explode there are two contrasting mechanisms\nshaping the chemical properties of the newly forming stars.\nFirst, the freshly ejected SNe II metals directly pollute the\ngas where new stars are forming. Second, the inner volume\nis expanding and the gas inside this region is mixed with\nlower metallicity material. In Sec. 5.1 we will show that,\nduring the chemical evolution process, it is possible to keep\nthe [Fe/H] abundance constant in the inner region (where\nthe new stars are forming) owing to these two contrasting\nmechanisms.\nWhile stars with peculiar properties form during the\nfirst stage, during the second stage the chemical properties\nof the forming stars \u03b1-enhanced) as SNe II start exploding.\nMarcolini et al. (2006) showed, for the specific case of dwarf\ngalaxies, that even if a single SN Ia can temporarily pollute\na small volume and dramatically change its chemical composition, its imprint disappears almost completely once the\ngas inside this volume mixes with the ISM. In the next section we will show that the last stars forming in our model\n(stars with [O/Fe]\u223c 0.5) do not show any signature of the\nformer AGB or SN Ia pollution, having chemical properties\ntypical of pure SNe II ejecta.\nWe will also show, in Sec. 5.1, that in our model the\ninner region is more metal rich than the outer region and,\naccordingly, the cooling is much more efficient there. Therefore, this region is more likely to host an extremely enhanced\nSF \u2013 typical of GCs \u2013 than the outer ISM (where normal\nhalo stars are forming).\nNumerous authors have discussed, from an energetics perspective, the possibility that stellar clusters can\n\n\fThe Chemical Evolution of Globular Clusters\n\n5\n\nTable 2.

For example, it has been suggested that stellar winds\nand SNe explosions from the first generation of stars can\nform a metal-enriched supershell, where further star formation is triggered (Brown et al. 1991, 1995; Thoul et al. 2002;\nParmentier 2004; Recchi & Danziger 2005). Brown et al.\n(1991) concluded that a small entirely self-enriched system of stars typically achieves a metallicity in the range\n10\u22122 \u2212 \u221210\u22121 Z\u2299 , and that the second generation of stars\nwould be expected to be extremely homogeneous in composition. Melioli & de Gouveia Dal Pino (2004) studied in\ndetail the heating efficiency (i.e., the fraction of SNe energy\nwhich is not radiated away) of SNe exploding in a starburst\nenvironment with properties similar to that of our model.\nThese authors found that the heating efficiency can be very\nclose to zero (i.e., all the SNe energy is efficiently radiated\naway) for, up to, a few tens of Myr, before rapidly increasing to unity and leading to a possible galactic wind. While\nwe cannot follow the dynamical evolution (and the energetics) of our model, it is possible to speculate that this second\nstage of star formation could be as rapid as \u223c 20 \u2212 40 Myr\n(with SNe II directly polluting the newly forming stars),\nor it could proceed in a long series of weak bursts if the\nstar formation is self-regulated - i.e., the gas is temporarily expelled out of the star forming regions by the SNe and\nre-collapses (due to the outer pressure) once the SNe II energy is radiated away. If the star formation is self-regulated,\nthe SF history can be as long as \u223c100 Myr. A longer SF\nhistory would require the contribution of AGB and SNe Ia\nself-pollution, which does not seem to be required in our\nmodel, to explain the chemical properties of GCs. Finally,\nin our case, the formation of a galactic wind would be associated with the cessation of the SF itself and it would happen\nafter \u223c 1 \u2212 5 \u00d7 103 SNe II explosions, depending upon the\ndetails of the model. Although these earlier studies seems\nto support the formation of second generation of stars after\nthe occurence of an explosive event, and the formation of\na bound system, hydrodynamical simulations of the SNe II\nself-enrichment phase in quantitative detail are needed to\nfurther quantify the star-formation timescales and the viability of our model from a dynamical point of view. These\nwill be presented in a forthcoming paper in this series.\n\n4\n\nYIELDS\n\nAs noted earlier we used IMF-averaged yields for both\nSNe II and intermediate AGB polluters. For SNe II, we\nexplore the effect of using yields computed by different authors (Woosley & Weaver 1995; Chieffi & Limongi\n2004; Kobayashi et al. 2006, see Table 2) and use the\nlimits 10\u201360 M\u2299 . Previous studies have found that the\nWoosley & Weaver (1995) models tend to overproduce the\namount of Fe \u2013 with a subsequent underestimation of\nthe [\u03b1/Fe] abundances \u2013 for this reason we half Fe values as done in several studies (e.g., Timmes et al. 1995;\nGoswami & Prantzos 2000; Fenner et al. 2004). While the\nset of yields are in reasonable agreement with one another\nfor most of the elements, occasional differences as large as\n0.4 dex are present (e.g., Gibson et al. 1997). We computed\na set of yields that we use throughout the paper unless\nstated otherwise. These yields are the average value of the\nabove mentioned theoretical set of yields when the agreement between them is good (when they differ less than\n0.4 dex). Otherwise, we chose the yields that best reproduce\nthe low metallicity (\u22122.0 6[Fe/H]6 \u22121.0) halo stars (e.g\nGratton et al. 2000). These computed values are labelled as\n\"Model\" yields in Table 2.\nFor SNe Ia we use the yields of Iwamoto et al. (1999),\nspecifically their case WDD1 (note however that for the elements considered in this paper a different choice of their\nSNe Ia model would not affect the results). For a consistent chemical evolution model, the metallicity of the prepolluting SN Ia and AGB stars should be be roughly the\nsame as the external region ([Fe/H]ISM ), while the metallicity of the self-polluting SNe II match that of the inner region\n([Fe/H]in ). Unfortunately, the set of yields of Iwamoto et al.\n(1999) are only available for solar metallicity and we are\nnot aware of low-metallicity SNe Ia yields available in the\nliterature.\nIn Table 3 we summarize the mean yields for\nintermediate-mass AGB stars, calculated by averaging the\nZ = 0.0001 values from Karakas & Lattanzio (2007) using a Salpeter (1955) IMF in the mass range 4\u20137 M\u2299 (we\nwill refer to this model as the \"reference model\"). As a\ncomparison we also show the yield values obtained averaging similar datasets at the same metallicity published\nby Karakas & Lattanzio (2003) and Izzard et al. (2007), as\nwell as the yields calculated by Fenner et al. (2004) for\nthe specific case of AGB self-pollution in NGC 6752 at\n[Fe/H]= \u22121.40. In general, each set is in good agreement\n\n\f6\n\nA. Marcolini et al.\nTable 3. Mean SNe II, SNe Ia and intermediate-mass AGB yields in solar masses.

(2006).\n\nalthough there are significant differences present for some\nelements (e.g., Na yields span \u223c 2 orders of magnitude).\nA detailed study of how the production of the Ne, Na,\nMg, and Al isotopes in AGB stars are effected by reaction\nrate uncertainties was carried out by Izzard et al. (2007).\nThey concluded that the most uncertain yields are those of\n26\nAl and 23 Na, with variations of two orders of magnitude.\nThe yields of 24 Mg and 27 Al have typical uncertainties of\none order of magnitude. These uncertainties are comparable to those resulting from stellar modelling uncertainties,\nwhere differences of one order of magnitude or more can\nbe found by varying the mass-loss rate or convective model\nVentura & D'Antona (2005a,b) and Karakas et al. (2006b).\nFor this reason we also decided to use a set of ad \u2212 hoc\nintermediate-mass AGB yields that represent the different\nelement production that we would require in order to reproduce the observational constraints in the framework of\nour model. This set of yields is presented in Table 3 as\n\"Model\". These values are within the limits of the abovementioned set of yields, and always within a factor of four\nof the values of the reference model (with the exception\nof Al see Section 5.3). In the following, the models using\nKarakas & Lattanzio (2007) (reference model) will be shown\nas solid lines, while the models using our proposed set of\nyields will be shown as dashed lines.\nWe would like to stress that the AGB yields we propose\nin Table 3 should not be taken as absolute values but as relative ratios between the different elements. This is because\nit is possible to re-scale the yields by changing the number of NAGB stars needed to fit the observations. We use\nnitrogen as a reference element and re-scale the other elements accordingly. We choose nitrogen because it is better\nconstrained than the other elements (e.g., Na, Al) since its\nproduction does not depend as strongly on reaction rate uncertainties. Note that the recent revision of the 14 N(p, \u03b3)15 O\nreaction rate (Bemmerer et al. 2006), \u223c 60% slower at temperatures below 100\u00d7106 K, would result in even more N\nproduction. Nitrogen yields are, however, effected by other\nmodelling uncertainties such as convection, mass loss and\nthe modelling of the third dredge-up (Marigo et al. 2003;\nKarakas et al. 2008). For example, an increase in the massloss rate would result in smaller N yields because of a shortened HBB phase (and also less Na, Mg and Al).\n\nFigure 4.

It is possible to maintain an invariant [Fe/H] abundance owing to a\ntuning between the two opposing mechanisms: SNe II eject freshly synthesized Fe (and O), which is mixed with gas from the inner\n(inhomogeneous) volume along with material from the external ISM, which has a lower [Fe/H] value.\n\nFigure 5.

While NGC 6752\ncan be defined as a \"normal\" GC, NGC 2808 and M 13 show\nextreme values of the [O/Fe] ratio (down to \u223c-1.0) and are\nexcellent cases to test our new proposed framework. In this\nsection we show how different choices of the initial conditions in the pre-enrichment during the MW halo formation\ncan led to different chemical peculiarities in the forming GC.\n\n5.1\n\n[Fe/H] and Metal content\n\nBefore going any further, it is important to follow the\niron content of the forming stars in our model. As previ-\n\nously mentioned, the possibility of SNe II and SN Ia selfenrichment in GC have not been considered in the literature\nbefore, because they produce large amounts of Fe, whereas\nthe [Fe/H] content in most of the GCs appears to be constant.\nThe initial conditions of NGC 6752 are summarized in\nTable 1: the Rin of the inhomogeneous region polluted by the\nSN Ia is 36 pc and this volume is also polluted by 250 intermediate 4\u20137 M\u2299 AGB stars. The mean iron content of the\nexternal region is [Fe/H]= \u22122.55, reflecting the early stage\nof the halo formation, while the effect of the SN Ia increases\nthe value of [Fe/H] up to \u22121.60 inside the inner region.

The dotted line corresponds to the case where we ignored the contribution\nof the SN Ia+AGB pollution only to the total metallicity log(Z/Z\u2299 ) (note that low initial [O/Fe] value can be achieved only due to the\nlocalized contribution of the SN Ia), while dashed lines correspond to the model with no pollution from AGB stars. Note that the initial\nvalue of log(Z/Z\u2299 ) (thus at low values of [O/Fe]) for the dotted line corresponds to the value of the metallicity for the external region.\nMost of the metals in the inner region are initially produced by AGB stars while at the end of the evolution only SNe II contribute to\nthe metal content.\n\nthe same table, we also summarize the initial parameters for\nthe cases of M 13 and NGC 2808.\nFor each GC, the initial conditions are constrained by\nthe observed stellar values of [Fe/H] and the peculiar values\nof [O/Fe]min and [Na/Fe]max (or alternatively the value of\n[N/Fe]max ), as each of these values depends mainly on one\npolluter. Since most of the iron in the inner region is produced by SN Ia, the initial [Fe/H]in content of the forming\nstars is set by the value of Rin , while oxygen is produced\nmainly by SNe II and Na by intermediate-mass AGB stars\n(see Tables 2 and 3). We assume that a SN Ia always deposits\nthe same amount of Fe (0.74 M\u2299 ), hence decreasing (increasing) the value of Rin has the effect of decreasing (increasing)\nthe hydrogen content inside the inner region and increasing\n(decreasesing) the [Fe/H] content (this is evident in Table 1,\nwhere the value of [Fe/H]in increases for lower values of Rin ).\nOnce the [Fe/H] content in the inner region is set, the overall [Fe/H]ISM value constrains the initial [O/Fe]min of the\nmodel: this is because, according to a pure SNe II pollution\nmodel, the O content is proportional to the Fe content (and\nthe Fe produced by SNe II can be ignored in the inner region). At this point, the observational value of [Na/Fe]max\nis sufficient to constrain the number of intermediate-mass\nAGB stars needed to reproduce the Na-O anti-correlations.\nFor example NGC 6752 and M 13 have similar initial\nvalues of [Fe/H], at \u2243 \u22121.60 and [Fe/H]\u2243 \u22121.50, respectively, that reflects comparable values of Rin . In contrast\nthe \"external\" values of [Fe/H]ISM for each cluster differ\nby an order of magnitude (see Table 1 reflecting, as shown\nlater, their different extreme values of [O/Fe]. In contrast,\nNGC 2808 shows an even higher value of [Fe/H]\u2243 \u22121.10 because of its smaller value for Rin =24 pc, even if its [Fe/H]ISM\nis slightly lower than for the case of NGC 6752 (see Table 1).\nIn Fig. 3 we show the [Fe/H] versus [O/Fe] abundance\nevolution of the reference model for NGC 6752. Data from\nYong et al. (2005) and Carretta et al. (2007) is included for\ncomparison. To compare our model with the Carretta's data,\nwe apply an offset of 0.1 dex to our predicted value of [Fe/H].\nThis is to take into account a similar difference in the mean\n[Fe/H] values between the two datasets. It is clear from the\nfigure that the [Fe/H] content remains relatively constant\n\nduring the whole evolution and it is consistent with the observational data. Likewise, the evolution of [O/Fe] increases\nmonotonically from its initial peculiar value [O/Fe]\u2243 \u22120.4\nto 0.5.\nThe [Fe/H] abundance stays constant during the evolution because of the tuning between the two mechanisms\nchanging the Fe content of the forming stars. While the\nnewly exploding SNe II eject freshly synthesized Fe, increasing the [Fe/H] content, their action also has the effect of\nexpanding the inhomogeneous inner region, mixing the inner material with the external ISM (with a lower [Fe/H]\ncontent). Both these two contrasting effects are controlled,\nin our model, by the parameter fexp (i.e., the rate of expansion of Rin after each SN II explosion, see Eq. 1) which\nincreases logarithmically with time. It is evident from Fig. 3\nthat, for this particular model, the effect of the expansion is,\nat the beggining, lowering the [Fe/H] content, whereas at a\nlater stage the SNe II pollution becomes increasingly dominant. The [O/Fe] abundance of the forming stars starts increase monotonically during the evolution, as the Fe content\nis practically constant and SNe II ejects a large amount of\nO (a mean SN II produces 1.82 M\u2299 of oxygen). Once the inhomogeneous region starts expanding, the O content of the\nforming stars reaches the asymptotic value of [O/Fe]=0.5,\ntypical of pure SNe II pollution.\nWe use two different values of fexp at two different\nstages, as this gives a better fit to the data. For example, for\nNGC 6752, the initial value of 1.0003 is increased to 1.001\nafter \u223c 103 SNe II have exploded. The effect on the model\nof this variation can be seen in Fig. 3 as an small \"hook\"\nat [O/Fe]\u223c0.25. Even if it were possible to better tune the\nmodel (by using another expansion law or simply by finding\nthe best parameter combination to maintain [Fe/H] perfectly\nconstant during the evolution), we are confident that such\na fine tuning is not necessary and would not significantly\nchange our conclusions. Indeed, given all the other model\nuncertainties we think it is unnecessary to attempt to fine\ntune the expansion caused by the SN II explosions. However,\nto check the robustness of our conclusions to the assumed\nexpansion value, we show in Fig. 3 the predicted trend of\n[Fe/H] vs. [O/Fe] for three different values of fexp (roughly\n\n\fThe Chemical Evolution of Globular Clusters\n\n9\n\nFigure 7.

It can be seen\nthat changing fexp by a factor of three affects the [Fe/H]\nratio of the forming stars by only 0.1-0.2 dex.\n\nof Bekki et al. (2007) such extreme values are achieved by\nassuming that no third dredge-up occurs in intermediatemass AGB stars.\n\nIn Fig. 5 we compare the results from our model with\nNGC 2808 and M 13. These GCs were chosen on the basis\nof their peculiar O depletion with values of [O/Fe] as low as\n\u22121.0. These low values are very difficult to obtain with only\nprimordial self-enrichment, which may explain the oxygen\ndepletion down to a minimum value [O/Fe]\u223c \u22120.5 but no\nlower. Extra mixing may also contribute to the depletion\nof oxygen but only for stars near the tip of the first giant\nbranch. D'Antona & Ventura (2007) invoke a combination\nof the two to explain the case of M 13, while in the model\n\nWe are able to reproduce the low values of [O/Fe] without any particular assumption (see Fig. 5). Indeed, such\nlow [O/Fe] values arise naturally if the inhomogeneous region \u2013 polluted by the initial SN Ia \u2013 is smaller in the\ncase of NGC 2808 and M13 than NGC 6752 (see Table 1).\nIn the case of M 13, the extreme low values of [O/Fe] of\n\u22121.0 requires a slightly smaller Rin as well as less oxygen from the SNe II that pre-polluted the halo. To fit the\nproperties of M 13, the metallicity of the original ISM gas\nat the time of GC formation needs to be very low, with\n\n\f10\n\nA. Marcolini et al.\n\na typical [ Fe/H] abundance an order of magnitude lower\n([Fe/H]ISM = \u22123.50) than for NGC 2808 or NGC 6752. This\nis despite the final [Fe/H] of M 13 is similar to NGC 6752.\nThe lower initial of [Fe/H]ISM for M 13 than for NGC 6752\ncould indicate that this GC formed at an earlier epoch and\nthat it is older than the other two GCs. Photometric ages of\nM M13 compared to NGC 6752 suggest that M 13 is older\n(Rakos & Schombert 2005), but these age determinations\nare highly uncertain and should be treated as tentative.\nIn Fig. 6 we show the evolution of the logarithm of the\nmetallicity (log(Z/Z\u2299 ) versus the [O/Fe] abundance inside\nthe inner region for the above models (solid lines). As in the\ncase of the [Fe/H] abundance, the total metallicity remains\napproximately constant during the evolution. The dashed\nlines represent the same evolution without taking into account the contribution of metals by intermediate-mass AGB\nstars to the total metallicity fraction. The dotted lines represent the case in which the contribution of SN Ia and AGB\nto the total metallicity are ignored (that is, only SNe II contribute to the global metallicity). Most of the initial metals\n(e.g., C, N) inside the inner region are due to localized AGB\npollution, while the SN Ia contribution is minimal. Indeed,\neven if a SNe Ia ejects large amounts of Fe (0.74 M\u2299 ) they\neject only 1.4 M\u2299 of total metals. Most of the \"metal\" are instead produced by AGB stars (an intermediate-mass AGB\nstar produces a mean value \u223c0.08 M\u2299 of metals, most of\nwhich is N; see Table 3). At the end of the evolution, most\nof the metals are produced by SNe II, where all lines converge to the same value in Fig. 6. This is also demonstrated\nby the asymptotic value of [O/Fe]=0.5 typical of pure SNe\nII pollution. Since the metallicity of the stars is roughly constant during the evolution this is also the metallicity of the\nforming stars.\nWe do not have a parameter that sets the fraction of\nSNe II that pollute the forming stars. Instead we calculate\nthat assuming the initial mass of the GC is the same as it\nis today (Pryor & Meylan 1993), and assuming a constant\ndensity and metallicity for the gas in the inner region, the\nfraction of SNe II ejecta that directly enriches the inner 30\n(50) pc (i.e., where the GC star should be forming) turns out\nto be very low, of the order of 0.5-1% (3-6%), depending on\nthe details of the model. Indeed, most of the metals produced\nby the SNe II are expelled beyond this limit of \u223c 50 pc.\n5.2\n\nThe O-Na anti-correlation\n\nIntermediate-mass AGB stars do not produce Fe and O\n(Karakas & Lattanzio 2007), hence they have a negligible\ncontribution to the evolution of these elements. AGB stars\ndo, however, produce a considerable amounts of Na.\nIn Fig. 7 we show the evolution of [O/Fe] versus [Na/Fe]\nabundances predicted by our model, together with the observational data from Yong et al. (2005) and Carretta et al.\n(2007, ; upper limits are shown as arrows) for the case of\nNGC 6752. As already mentioned, the first stars to form\nin our model are [Na/Fe]-rich (due to the Na-rich AGB\npollution) and [O/Fe]-depleted (due to the localized ironrich SN Ia ejecta). The effect of the SN Ia is to mitigate\nthe increase of the [Na/Fe] abundance that would otherwise reach much higher values. For example, in Fenner et\nal. (2004) the [Na/Fe] abundance increased to [Na/Fe]\u22431.7.\nOnce the first SNe II starts to pollute the ISM and the\n\nTable 4.

In the figure we show two different predictions\nusing 1) our reference model yields, and 2) the same yields\nbut with the Na yields from Karakas & Lattanzio (2007) reduced by a factor of four. While the reference model shows\na clear O-Na anti-correlation, qualitatively in agreement\nwith the observations, it overestimates the initial value of\n[Na/Fe] by \u223c0.4-0.6 dex. In comparison, the model with\nthe reduced Na yields reproduces better the observed anticorrelation. Note that the reduced value (hNai=4.0 \u00d7 10\u22124\nM\u2299 ) is in better agreement with the Na production reported\nby Fenner et al. (2004) (hNai = 5.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 M\u2299 ), and by\nKarakas & Lattanzio (2007) for more metal-rich AGB stars\n(hNai=7.7\u00d710\u22124 M\u2299 for Z = 0.004). The reduced Na yields\nare also well within model uncertainties (see Table 3). It is\nalso possible to obtain a very good match to the absolute values of [Na/Fe] by simply reducing (by same factor of 4) the\namount of AGB pollution compared to the reference model\n(see Table 1), because the number of AGB stars has little\neffect on O and Fe (see Table 3). However, as discussed in\nSec. 4, we use AGB nitrogen production as a reference (see\n\u00a7 5.5). Thus, in the following we will always assume a mean\nvalue of hNai=4.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 from intermediate-mass AGB\nstars.\nThe [O/Fe] versus [Na/Fe] abundance evolution for the\nmodels tailored for NGC 2808 and M 13 are shown in Fig. 8,\nalong with their respective observational datasets. The ONa anti-correlation is well reproduced for these two GCs,\nincluding the extremely low values of [O/Fe].\n\n5.3\n\nThe Mg-Al anti-correlation\n\nIn the left panel of Fig. 9 we compare the predictions of\nour reference model (solid line) for NGC 6752 with the observed Al-Mg anti-correlation found by Yong et al. (2005).\nThis dataset shows anti-correlations in stars that are both\nbrighter and fainter than the first giant branch bump,\nstrongly suggesting that the peculiarities should be present\nin the gas from which the stars formed, and not caused by internal stellar evolution. It is apparent that there is a spread\nof \u223c 1.3 dex in Al relative to Fe but only a modest spread\nof \u223c 0.3 dex in Mg relative to Fe (the corresponding [O/Fe]\nspread discussed in Section 5.2 is \u223c 1.0 dex).\nIn our framework, the first stars to form have enhanced Al ([Al/Fe]\u2243 1.4) and depleted Mg ([Mg/Fe]\u2243 0.2),\nwhile subsequent generations evolve toward [Al/Fe]\u2243 0.0\nand [Mg/Fe]\u22430.5. It is apparent that our reference model\n(Fig. 9) can only account for the Mg variation and fails to\n\n\fThe Chemical Evolution of Globular Clusters\n\n11\n\nFigure 10.

As\nin Fig. 9, the solid lines refer to the model using yields from Karakas & Lattanzio (2007), whereas the dashed lines refer to the model\nwith increased Al from AGB stars. The evolution is plotted against the observational datasets of Carretta et al. (2006) for the case\nof NGC 2808 (left panel) and Sneden et al. (2004, asterisks), Johnson et al. (2005, squares) and Cohen & Mel\u00e9ndez (2005, crosses) for\nthe case of M 13. Regarding M 13, we point out that there is an offset of 0.2 dex for the Mg abundance between our model and the\nobservational dataset. Bottom panels: the predicted [(Al+Mg)/Fe] versus [O/Fe] abundances; line styles are as above.\n\nreproduce the \u223c 1.5 dex spread in Al. The small amount of\nAl produced in the models of Karakas & Lattanzio (2007) is\nnot enough to countervail the large amount of Fe deposited\nby the single SN Ia: the net results is that the [Al/Fe] ratio\nactually decreases in our model. Note that even in the case\nof pure AGB pollution (Fenner et al. 2004), the maximum\n[Al/Fe] value is underestimated by a factor of \u223c 0.7 dex. If\nwe assume that low-metallicity AGB stars produce a mean\nvalue of Al\u223c 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 (instead of the literature values\nof \u223c 10\u22124 M\u2299 ) shown in Table 3, the Al-Mg anti-correlation\nis remarkably well reproduced.\nIn the upper panels of Fig. 10, we plot the [Mg/Fe] versus [Al/Fe] evolution of our reference models for M 13 (right\npanel) and NGC 2808 (left panel) against the corresponding\nobservational datasets (Sneden et al. 2004; Johnson et al.\n2005; Cohen & Mel\u00e9ndez 2005; Carretta et al. 2006). Again\nthe reference models are not able to reproduce the Al enhancement, while models with a factor of \u223c 50 more Al\nproduction from intermediate-mass AGB stars are able to\nreproduce the anti-correlation perfectly. The dotted line in\nthe right panel represents the same dashed line but offset\nby 0.2 dex in [Mg/Fe]. At low [Al/Fe] values there is a difference of \u223c0.2 dex between the [Mg/Fe] values of the two\nGCs.\n\nAt this point, it is worth asking if our proposed Al yield\n(\u223c 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 ) from intermediate-mass AGB stars is\nconsistent with the uncertainties present in the theoretical\nmodels, as well as with other available observations in other\nsystems. To test this latter point, we ran a test chemical evolution model of the Milky Way using GEtool (Fenner et al.\n2002) with the same enhancement in Al AGB yields that is\nrequired for the GC model. The result is only a small difference (within \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.3 dex and only for [Fe/H]>-1.6)\ncompared with the canonical MW model.\nThe yields of 27 Al are affected by variations in the\nnuclear reaction rates, as well as the treatment of mass\nloss and convection. For example both, the 26 Mg(p,\u03b3)27 Al\nand 26 Al(p,\u03b3)27 Si reactions play an important role in determining the final 27 Al abundance in a given AGB model.\nIzzard et al. (2007) concluded that the yields of 26 Al and\n27\nAl can vary by up to \u223c 2 orders of magnitude, depending on the mass, metallicity and choice of Mg-Al\nreaction rates. The yields of Al decrease with increasing mass loss, because more mass is lost before significant Al can be synthesized from Mg via the HBB. The\nyields of nitrogen and Al (but also C, Na and Mg) depend also on the third dredge-up (Ventura & D'Antona\n2005a,b; Karakas et al. 2006b). While there is uncertainty\n\n\f12\n\nA. Marcolini et al.\nels plotted against the [O/Fe] abundance. If we assume the\nabove mentioned Al enhancement in AGB yields, the sum\nAl+Mg appears to be surprisingly constant (in the reference\nmodel this sum is only constant within a factor of two). Increasing the yields of Mg by 50% does not change this result,\nand the sum of Mg+Al is constant to within 0.1 dex (dotted\nline).\n5.4\n\nFigure 9.

The dotted line refers to the previous model but\nwith a 50% enhancement of the 25 Mg and 26 Mg yields from AGB\nstars (see Section 5.4 for more details of this model).

Moreover, hot-bottom burning is the major production site for\nAl (as well as for Na and Mg). In Fig. 9 we show that increasing the AGB yields of Mg by 50% (particularly 25 Mg\nand 26 Mg, see next subsection) does not have a significant\neffect on the ability of the model to reproduce the Mg-Al\nanti-correlation observed in NGC 6752. It is not clear, however, if the model uncertainties would allow for an increase\nin the Al abundance by a factor of 50 and further study of\nthis problem is required.\nUsing data for 18 stars, Carretta et al. (2007) noted\nthat the sum of Mg+Al is approximately constant in\nNGC 2808 for stars in all evolutionary phases (that is, constant over the whole magnitude range). The conclusion to\nbe drawn from this observation is that there has been a\nreshuffling of Mg into Al in these stars. The bottom panels\nof Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show the sum of Mg+Al of our mod-\n\nThe Mg isotope ratios\n\nA further important test for our model is determining how\nwell it can reproduce the Mg isotopic ratios observed in\nGC stars (e.g. for NGC 6752 Yong et al. 2003). The Mg\nproduction from AGB stars is mainly in the form of the\nneutron-rich magnesium isotopes, 25 Mg and 26 Mg, which are\nproduced in the He-burning shell (e.g. Karakas & Lattanzio\n2003). In Table 4 we summarize the mean 25 Mg/24 Mg and\n26\nMg/24 Mg ratios for the intermediate-mass AGB yields of\nKarakas & Lattanzio (2007), as well as the same ratios for\ndifferent SNe II models computed by different authors. It\nis apparent that the ratios 25 Mg/24 Mg and 26 Mg/24 Mg are\nmuch higher in the case of AGB pollution compared to SNe\nII, where SNe II preferentially produce 24 Mg at low metallicities. In the following we will adopt a constant value of\n0.01 for both 25 Mg/24 Mg and 26 Mg/24 Mg to reflect SNe II\n(see Table 4; adopting values from different authors does not\nsignificantly change the results).\nIn Fig. 11 we show the observed Mg isotopic ratios\nfor NGC 6752 from Yong et al. (2003), plotted against the\n[O/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], and [Al/Fe]. In this figure we include the predictions from our reference model (solid lines).\nThe agreement is satisfactory, except in the case of Al (solid\nline) which, as already discussed, can be accommodated by\nassuming a larger Al production from AGB stars (dashed\nline). Both the 25 Mg/24 Mg and 26 Mg/24 Mg ratios decrease\nas the GC stars evolve from the AGB-SN Ia peculiar pollution (25 Mg/24 Mg\u223c0.5 and 26 Mg/24 Mg\u223c 0.15), to predominantly self pollution by SNe II (25 Mg/24 Mg\u223c0.01 and\n26\nMg/24 Mg\u223c 0.01).\nAll GC chemical evolution models so far have failed to\nreproduce the Mg isotopic ratios observed in NGC 6752 (e.g.\nFenner et al. 2004; Ventura & D'Antona 2005c). One of the\nstrongest conclusions from Fenner et al. (2004) was that it\nis not possible to reproduce the Mg-Al anti-correlation and\nthe Mg isotopic ratios with a classical AGB self pollution\nscenario. This is because AGB stars produce Mg instead of\ndestroying it, and thus Mg and Al are correlated. In our\nmodel the [Mg/Fe] depletion is mainly caused by the effect\nof the SN Ia, hence the production of Mg from AGB stars\nis not significant. The Mg production instead helps to explain why strong [O/Fe] depletions (of up to \u22120.5) are not\naccompanied by a similarly low [Mg/Fe] abundances. Even\nan increase of 50% in the 25 Mg and 26 Mg yields from AGB\nmodels does not effect our conclusions, and instead meliorates the Mg isotopic ratios when plotted against [Mg/Fe]\n(see Fig. 11).\nNote that varying the Mg ratios in the SNe II yields\nfrom 25 Mg/24 Mg and 26 Mg/24 Mg \u223c 0.01 to 0.1 would help\nto fit the observational data. In Fig. 12 we show the Mg\nisotopes ratios versus [Na/Fe] from Yong et al.

(2005) for 9\ndwarfs (filled diamonds), 9 sub-giants stars (open diamonds), along with 2 giants stars (open triangles) observed by Smith & Norris (1993). Comparison with stars\nnear the main sequence is preferred, because variations due\nto the first dredge-up and deep mixing can affect the abundances of evolved stars. However, it is very difficult to obtain high-quality spectra of main-sequence stars owing to\ntheir low brightness. In the following we will not discuss\n\nthe effect of stellar evolution on the changes to the surface abundances of C and N (instead we refer the interested reader to Smith & Tout 1992; Charbonnel 1994, 1995;\nDenissenkov & Tout 2000; Weiss et al. 2000; Gratton et al.\n2004, and references therein).\nWhile the more evolved stars (open symbols) show a\nclear C-N anti-correlation, similar to that observed in other\nGCs (see also Fig. 14 for M 13), the inclusion of the dwarf\nstars makes it difficult to distinguish a clear evolutionary\npattern. Carretta et al. (2005) pointed out that the spectra\nfor these turn-off stars did not have enough quality to allow\nfor an accurate determination of the carbon abundances;\nthe same also applies to the 12 C/13 C ratios (see \u00a7 5.7). Typical errors for the [C/Fe] abundances are of the order of\n\u223c 0.2 dex with the exception of the dwarf stars that show\nlarger uncertainties.\nA quick examination of Table 3 shows that nitrogen is the element produced in the largest proportions by\nintermediate-mass AGB stars. Thus, it is not surprising that\nthe first stars forming in the inner region initially polluted by\nAGB stars show very high values of [N/Fe] (\u223c 1.5) despite\nthe action of the SN Ia. For comparison, in Fenner et al.\n(2004), stars polluted with AGB ejecta show [N/Fe] values\nas high as \u223c2.0). Carbon is also produced in intermediatemass AGB stars, although not to the same level as N, hence\nthe [C/Fe] ratios remains low. A glance at Fig. 13 shows that\nwhile a large variation of [N/Fe] is achieved in our model in\naccordance with observations, the ratio of [C/Fe] remains\nalmost constant. While [C/Fe]\u223c 0.0 at high values of [N/Fe]\nis consistent with the observed [C/Fe] abundances inferred\nfrom dwarf stars, assuming a factor of 4 less carbon is produced by AGB stars does a much better job of reproducing\nthe C-N anti-correlation observed in sub-giant stars. (see\nFig. 13 and Table 3).\nThe C-N anti-correlation is also seen for stars on the\n\n\f14\n\nA. Marcolini et al.\nTo test the possible contribution of low-metallicity\nfast rotators or mass loss in metal-poor massive stars\n(Meynet & Maeder 2002b,a) we qualitatively increase the\nnitrogen mean yield for SNe II, from our reference value of\n[N/Fe]=\u22120.90 to values of [N/Fe]=\u22120.30 and 0.0. This increase only slightly changes the results, by increasing the\nminimum value of [N/Fe]\u2243 \u22120.4 in Fig. 14 by a factor of\n0.20-0.40 dex.\n5.6\n\nFigure 13. Upper Panel: evolution of [C/Fe] versus [N/Fe] for\nthe reference model (solid line) for NGC 6752, plotted against\nobservational data of two AGB stars by Smith & Norris (1993)\n(triangle), and 9 sub-giants stars (open diamonds) and 7 dwarf\nstars (filled diamonds) by Carretta et al. (2005) (squares). The\ndashed line represents the model with AGB C yields decreased by\na factor of 4.

The evolution of each single element is also\nshown: C (dotted lines), N (dot dashed line), and O (dashed line).\n\nmain sequence turn off of M 13 (Briley et al. 2004b) (see\nFig. 14), whereas we are not aware of a similar dataset for\nNGC 2808 (although the C-N evolution of this GC is similar to M 13 for more evolved stars). We refer to Briley et al.\n(2004b) for a discussion of the uncertainties affecting the\nabundances; these can be large (up to 0.5 dex, see their\nFig. 5) owing to the faintness of the observed stars. Again\nthe two models show quite similar results, with [C/Fe] remaining approximately constant in the reference model, and\nthe model that assumes C is under produced by a factor of 4\ndoing the best job of reproducing the C-N anti-correlation.\n\nThe sum of C+N+O\n\nOne of the most important observational constraints that\nany GC chemical evolution model needs to fulfill is the\nconstancy of the sum C+N+O (e.g Ivans et al. 1999;\nCarretta et al. 2005). Self pollution scenarios using AGB\nmodels calculated using the mixing-length theory (MLT) of\nconvection (Fenner et al. 2004; Karakas et al. 2006a) predict\nthat stars forming from different generations of AGB ejecta\nshow large increases in the CNO sum. This is in contrast to\nAGB models computed using the \"full spectrum of turbulence\" convective model (Ventura & D'Antona 2005b) that\nmanage to keep the sum of CNO constant within a factor of\ntwo. This is because the Ventura & D'Antona (2005b) show\nlittle third dredge-up (which increases C and hence N) and\nmore efficient HBB (which converts C and O to N). Hence,\nMLT models create C and N rich AGB ejecta at almost constant O (see Fig. 4 in Fenner et al. 2004). FST models result\nin moderately O-depleted AGB ejecta that is only moderately enriched in N Ventura & D'Antona (2005b)\nIn the bottom panel of Fig. 13 we show the C+N+O\nsum (solid line) of our model for NGC 6752, together with\n[C/Fe] (dotted lines), [N/Fe] (dot-dashed line) and [O/Fe]\n(dashed line) plotted against [N/Fe]. In the same figure\nwe also include the observational data from Carretta et al.\n(2005) for 5 sub-giants and 7 dwarf stars from the same GC.\nIt is quite remarkable that our model predicts a practically\nconstant CNO sum and is a satisfactory fit to the observations. It is apparent that while the [C/Fe] abundance remains approximately constant, a large variation of [N/Fe]\ncomes with a similarly large variation in [O/Fe]. The N deposited by AGB stars is counteracted by the O production\nin SNe II when the inner region expands and mixes (lowering the [N/Fe] value]). In principle, in our model, there is no\nreason for this to happen because the mechanisms controlling the Fe abundance and the CNO sum are different (i.e.,\nSNe II, SN Ia, and AGB). For example, more AGB pollution (or no AGB pollution at all) would increase (decrease)\nthe initial CNO sum and the condition C+N+O=constant\nwould not be fulfilled. However, in the three particular GC\nconsidered here, once the free parameters are fixed to reproduce the observed anti-correlations, a constant C+N+O\nnaturally arises.\nThe thin solid lines and dotted lines in the lower panels of Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 refer to the case in which the\nC production from AGB stars is lowered by a factor of 4\nto better fit the C-N anti-correlation. In this case the sum\nof C+N+O also remains quite constant, in agreement with\nthe observations. The fact that a variation of 0.4 dex of the\n[C/Fe] abundance only slightly changes the CNO sum is understandable if we consider that O and N are a factor of \u223c\n8 more abundant than C at low values of [N/Fe] and high\nvalues of [N/Fe], respectively.\n\n\fThe Chemical Evolution of Globular Clusters\n\n15\n\nFigure 15.

(2008).\n\nFigure 14. M 13 Upper Panel: evolution of [C/Fe] versus [N/Fe]\nfor the reference model (solid line) plotted against the observational data of Briley et al. (2004a).

Lower panel: the evolution of the sum of\n[(C+N+O)/Fe] (solid lines) for the reference model (thick lines)\nas well as for the model with reduced C (thin lines). The evolution of each single element is also shown: C (dotted lines), N\n(dot dashed line) and O (dashed line). The corresponding two\ndiagrams for the case of NGC 2808 are almost identical to the\nresults for M 13 and not shown.\n\n5.7\n\nThe carbon isotope ratio\n\nIn Fig. 15 we show the evolution of the 12 C/13 C ratio versus\n[Na/Fe] from our model plotted against observational data\nfrom Carretta et al. (2005) for sub-giant stars in NGC 6752.\nOwing to the poor quality of the spectra, these authors were\nnot able to derive the carbon isotopic ratio for dwarf stars.\nOur model over-predicts the 12 C/13 C ratio at any value of\n[Na/Fe] and by up to a factor of 1.5 dex. Chiappini et al.\n(2008) and Hughes et al. (2008) note that a model without\n\nfast rotators gives very high values of the 12 C/13 C ratio of\nup to 104 because SNe II mainly produce 12 C (solid line\nin Fig. 15). Such high values are not reached in Fig. 15\nbecause of the partial contribution from intermediate-mass\nAGB stars, that also produce low 12 C/13 C ratio yields (see\nTable 4). The Chiappini et al. (2008) model with rapidly rotating massive stars brings the ratio down to 12 C/13 C\u223c80\n(dashed line) at [Fe/H]=\u22123.5 and down to 12 C/13 C\u223c30\n(dot-dashed line) at [Fe/H]=\u22125.0. If low-metallicity, rapidly\nrotating massive stars contribute some 13 C, the predicted\ncarbon isotope ratio will be lower but not as low as required\nto match the observational data (see dashed and dot-dashed\nline in Fig. 15).\nEvidently it is not possible to reproduce the observed\n12\nC/13 C ratios without invoking internal stellar evolution\n(e.g., the first dredge-up and/or extra-mixing processes). In\nthe more luminous sub-giant stars the observed isotopic ratio 12 C/13 C is very low, typically in the range of \u223c 3 to\n11 (noting that the equilibrium value of the CNO cycle\nis \u2248 3). The first dredge-up can reduce the ratio from 90\n(solar) to \u223c 20 in standard stellar evolution models (e.g.,\nBoothroyd & Sackmann 1999). Shetrone (2003) found that\nin NGC 6528 and M 4 this ratio declines steeply with increasing luminosity along the RGB. The discontinuity in the\n12\nC/13 C ratio occurs at the bump luminosity and has also\nbeen detected in metal-poor field halo stars (Gratton et al.\n2004).\nCarretta et al. (2005) inferred a lower limit of 10 for\nthe 12 C/13 C ratio for the three dwarf stars in NGC 104.\nEven if these values are more in accordance with our model,\nfurther determinations of the 12 C/13 C ratio in turn-off stars\nis needed before making a more detailed comparison.\n\n\f16\n\nA. Marcolini et al.\nassume a primordial value of Y \u223c 0.248 (Coc et al. 2004). It\nis quite evident that in the cases of NGC 6752 and M 13 the\nincrease is quite modest and within \u2206Y \u223c 0.015, whereas\nfor the specific case of NGC 2808 we obtained Y \u223c 0.29.\nThis larger rise in the Y values is due to the larger density of\npolluting intermediate-mass AGB stars in NGC 2808, which\nis \u223c2-3 times greater than for the other GCs.\nEven if NGC 2808 is the only GC out of the three that\nshows a appreciable helium variation, a maximum value of\nY \u223c 0.29 is smaller than the postulated very high value of\nY \u223c 0.40 required to explain the most enriched stars in the\ntriple main sequence (Piotto et al. 2007). It is very close,\nhowever, to the value of Y \u223c 0.32 (Bedin et al. 2000) required to explain the unusual HB morphology for NGC 2808.\n\n6\n\nFigure 16. Evolution of the helium content, Y , versus [O/Fe].\nThe red solid line represents the model for NGC 6752; the blue\ndotted line for M 13; the dot dashed orange line for NGC 2808.\n\n5.8\n\nThe Helium Content\n\nThe unusual HB morphology observed in NGC 2808, which\nexhibits an extended blue tail and a gap separating the red\nand the blue clumps (Bedin et al. 2000), can be reproduced\nif the blue stars have a higher helium content (Y \u223c 0.32)\ncompared to those in the red clump, with primordial helium\n(Y \u223c 0.24) (D'Antona & Caloi 2004). NGC 2808 is also\nknown to have a peculiar main sequence (D'Antona et al.\n2005), in which the bluer stars are inferred to have an higher\nhelium content from fitting theoretical isochrones to the observed data. To reproduce the colour-magnitude diagram\n(CMD), D'Antona et al. (2005) suggested that \u223c 20% of\nthe stars have a helium content as high as Y \u223c 0.40, \u223c 30%\nhave a spread of Y between 0.24 and 0.29, while the remaining 50% of the stellar population have primordial Y . Further\nobservations discovered a triple main sequence in NGC 2808\n(Piotto et al. 2005), that has given support to the extreme\nvalue of Y \u223c 0.40 required to fit the CMD.\nEven if such large Y values are required to reproduce\nthe main features of the CMD, the origin of the helium is\nnot known. Helium values as high as Y = 0.40 are very difficult to reproduce with canonical chemical evolution models without violating other observational constraints (e.g.\nKarakas et al. 2006a). D'Antona & Caloi (2004) required a\nfactor of \u223c 10 more intermediate-mass AGB stars than\nwhat it is inferred from a Salpeter-like IMF to return the\namount of Y needed to form the number of blue HB stars in\nNGC 2808. Karakas et al. (2006a) highlights the difficulty in\nproducing the large postulated helium enrichment using the\nAGB self-pollution scenario. In particular, their largest predicted value of Y \u223c 0.29 is accompanied by a large increase\nin sum C+N+O.\nIn Section 5.6 we show that one of the main successes of\nthis model is the ability to reproduce the C+N+O sum for\nall three GCs NGC 6752, M 13, and NGC 2808. In Fig. 16\nwe plot the helium content Y of the reference models for\neach cluster against their [O/Fe] abundances. Note that we\n\nCOMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS MODELS\nAND GENERAL COMMENTS\n\nTo explain the peculiar chemical properties observed in GCs,\nwe propose a model based on a new idea of pre-peculiar inhomogeneous pollution produced by the explosion of a single\nSNe Ia. In principle, due to the low star formation rate during the formation of the proto-halo, the possibility that 2 or\n3 (or more) SNe Ia explode essentially simultaneously (<2030 Myr apart in time) in a region smaller than 30-50 pc is\nmuch less probable than having a single event. Having said\nthat, our model can accomodate such a scenario without a\ndramatic impact on the predictions based upon the base scenario of a single SNe Ia event. For example, if 2 (or 3) SNe\nIa explode in the same region, ejecting therefore a factor of\n2 (or 3) more \u221a\niron, an\u221aexpansion (i.e., an increase of Rin )\nof a factor of 3 2 (or 3 3) would lead to the same [Fe/H]\nand chemical properties seen in the base model. In the case\nof no SNe Ia, but intermediate-mass stellar AGB pollution,\none is left with the classical \"external\" GC self enrichment\nscenario (Bekki et al. 2007) in which the high values of N,\nNa (and other elements produced in substantial amounts by\nAGB stars) are easily explained, but it is very difficult to\nexplain the depletion in oxygen. Since all the well-observed\nGCs seem to have an oxygen-depleted population of stars at\nsome level, in our framework we must assume that the inhomogenous contribution of SN Ia is the seed for the formation\nof GCs.\nOf course, a larger number of SNe Ia may contribute to\nthe enrichment of the proto-halo ISM (outside the proto-GC\nregion). We believe, though, that the approximation of an\nISM being enriched only by SNII products is sound one, as\nthe SNe Ia contribution to the \"mean\" MW's stars' chemical properties starts being important only after \u223c1.5 Gyr\nand at [Fe/H] > \u22121 (Tinsley 1979; Edvasrdsson et al. 1993;\nMcWilliam 1997). The [Fe/H]ISM values in our models are,\nin all cases, lower than this value.\nBekki et al. (2007) point out that one of the greatest\nadvantages of an external AGB-pollution scenario is that\nthe fraction of peculiar stars observed in GCs is not limited\nto the amount of a stars forming in the first generation. In\nparticular, in this model the fraction of O-depleted to Orich stars depends only in the way that the SNe II pollution\nproceeds, while the number of AGB stars initially polluting\nthe inner region is quite low (NAGB \u2243 200; see Table 1). The\ntotal amount of stars needed to create a typical value of 200\n\n\fThe Chemical Evolution of Globular Clusters\nintermediate-mass AGB stars is \u223c 104 M\u2299 , which is a small\nfraction of the total MW Halo or GC mass. Even assuming\nthat this number of stars are trapped in the potential well of\nthe forming GC and are homogeneously distributed within\n50 (or 100) pc, their density would be 1.9\u00d710\u22122 (2.4\u00d710\u22123 )\nM\u2299 pc\u22123 which is low compared to the densities observed in\nGCs (e.g., Pryor & Meylan 1993).\nIn principle, our proposed scenario has no particular\nproblems explaining the observed high fraction of peculiar\nto normal stars observed in some GCs (e.g., Carretta et al.\n2006, for NGC 2808). The self-pollution scenario, on the\nother hand, requires ad hoc assumptions such as an anomalous IMF peaked at 4\u20138 M\u2299 (e.g., Smith & Norris 1982;\nD'Antona & Caloi 2004; Prantzos & Charbonnel 2006); or\nthat the GC was initially much more massive and has lost\n\u223c90-99 per cent of the stars that were formed in the first\ngeneration through tidal stripping. Our model does not require these assumptions: the only assumption we require is\nthat star formation should proceed more or less smoothly\nwhile SNe II explode and self enrich the proto-GC; and the\nchemical properties of the forming stars evolve from peculiar\nto normal. The fraction of normal to peculiar stars depends\non how the SF proceeded and we will try to address this\nproblem with detailed hydrodynamical simulations.\nIn previous models (e.g. Fenner et al. 2004;\nD'Antona et al. 2005; Bekki et al. 2007) the CN bimodality is not reproduced due to the lack of C-depleted\nand N-rich stars, since C is produced in AGB stars. The\nsame is also true for Mg, with the result that positive C-N\nand Mg-Al correlations are found in contradiction to the\nobservational constraints. Bekki et al. (2007) tried to solve\nthis problem by using yields from AGB models that had no\nthird dredge-up (as these authors noted, this assumption is\npurely hypothetical). The smaller production of C is what\nallows this study to reproduce the C-N anti-correlation.\nThe O-Na and Al-Mg trends were not recovered because\nthe lack of dredge-up resulted in a smaller production of Na\nand Mg (mainly 26 Mg). Note that in all AGB models, O\ndestruction via HBB is not efficient enough to account for\nthe very low O abundances observed in some GC stars (typically [O/Fe] \u2248 \u22120.5 or less). The non-standard models of\nVentura & D'Antona (2005c) (see also Ventura & D'Antona\n2006) that use a different convection model, can reproduce\nmost of the abundance anomalies but only when including\nconvective overshooting to force some third dredge-up along\nwith adopting high mass-loss rates. In our model none of\nthe above assumptions are required. We use the AGB yields\nof Karakas & Lattanzio (2007), averaged over a canonical\nSalpeter IMF.\nThe success of our model is the combined effect of inhomogeneous AGB pollution together with the effect of a\nsingle SN Ia and its Fe-rich ejecta. The net effect is to lower\nthe ratio [Xi /Fe], where the element Xi is negligibly produced (or destroyed) relative to SN II in intermediate-mass\nAGB stars (e.g., oxygen). In the case where Xi is produced\nby AGB stars, the ratio is either maintained at an approximately constant value or the enhancement is mitigated owing to the effect of the SN pollution (e.g., C, Na, Mg and\npossibly Al). The only real problem that our model suffers is\nthe production of Al should be enhanced by a factor of \u223c 10\u2013\n50 compared to the AGB yields from Karakas & Lattanzio\n\n17\n\n(2007). Our model, however, is the first that has shown any\npromise at explaining the Mg isotopic ratios in GC stars.\nOne possibility in a canonical AGB self-pollution model\nis that the second generation of stars did not form from\nAGB-enriched material but these stars had their surfaces\npolluted by AGB winds (e.g., Dantona et al. 1983). In our\nframework the O-depleted stars obtain their abundances\nfrom SNe Ia pollution mixed with AGB material. We could\nimage a similar surface pollution model as follows: after the\nfirst \"normal\" generation of stars have formed, self pollution by intermediate-mass AGB stars and SNe Ia (which has\nsimilar timescales; see Section 2) start inhomogeneously polluting the surface of stars. It would be difficult, however, to\nexplain all the chemical properties of GC stars with surface\npollution. For example, it would probably not be possible\nto maintain [Fe/H] constant in the most O-depleted stars.\nWhile surface pollution of SN Ia ejecta would decrease the\n[O/Fe] ratio it would also dramatically increase the surface\nFe content of the star.\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have modelled the chemical evolution of GCs under the\nhypothesis that the abundance anomalies were set during\nthe formation of the Milky Way Halo (or inside their host\ndwarf galaxies). Inside a volume of gas enriched to some level\nby a first generation of low-metallicity SNe II, GC formation takes place owing to the inhomogeneous (respect to the\nsurrounding ISM) effect of a single SN Ia plus material from\nintermediate-mass AGB stars. After a burst of star formation, new SNe II start to explode, self-polluting and expanding out the inhomogeneous region, which mixes with the\nsurrounding (metal poorer) ISM. In our framework, all the\npeculiar stars observed in GCs (e.g., O-depleted, Na-rich)\nwere born in the above inhomogeneously enriched volume,\nwhile \"normal\" stars (i.e., O-rich, Na-depleted) are formed\nsuccessively once the SNe II associated with the SF have\nwashed out the inhomogeneous region and self-polluted the\nISM. In conclusion, our main findings can be summarized as\nfollows:\n(i) We reproduce the O-Na anti-correlation. In our model\nthe first stars to form have low [O/Fe] and high [Na/Fe]\nabundances, with the system then evolving toward \"normal\"\nabundances once SNe II start polluting the ISM.\n(ii) We reproduce the Mg-Al anti-correlation, but\nonly by assuming that intermediate-mass AGB produce\nmore Al than predicted by theoretical models (e.g.,\nKarakas & Lattanzio 2007). This assumption needs to be\ncarefully studied in the context of AGB model uncertainties.\n(iii) We satisfactorily produce the Mg isotopic ratios observed in NGC 6752.\n(iv) The [Fe/H] abundance remains approximately constant during the evolution. This is because of mixing caused\nby the subsequent SNe II explosions between the Fe-enriched\ninhomogeneous inner region and the [Fe/H]-poorer ISM. The\nFe produced by the SNe II themselves does not significantly\naffect the resulting Fe abundance in the forming GC stars.\n(v) We reproduce the C-N anti-correlation within observational uncertainties, and the sum C+N+O remains \u2248 constant, in agreement with the observations. The best fit is ob-\n\n\f18\n\nA. Marcolini et al.\n\ntained, however, by assuming that the AGB stars produce a\nfactor of four less C. This assumption may not be in accord\nwith current theoretical models.\n(vi) The model cannot reproduce the 12 C/13 C ratios observed in evolved giant stars in the GCs, and internal stellar\nevolution processes are required.\n(vii) GCs are a factor of \u223c ten more metal rich than coeval MW halo stars (which are the assumed stellar host population).\nIn a forthcoming paper we will focus on other elements\n(e.g, Li, F, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Co, Ni, and Cu) to further test our\nframework. We will also focus upon the extreme metallicity\nGC cases that may prove to be a challenge for our model: the\nvery metal poor M15 ([Fe/H]=\u22122.26) and the metal-rich 47\nTuc ([Fe/H]=\u22120.76). Preliminary results are encouraging.\nOne last question we could ask is why would all GCs\nshow such a peculiar enrichment as outlined in this paper?\nEven if we do not have a conclusive answer, the region enriched by the SN Ia and AGB stars has a [Fe/H] abundance\nand metallicity, Z, that is a factor of \u223c ten higher than the\nsurrounding ISM. Thus could be due to the corresponding\nenhanced cooling, this region may be more likely than the\nhalo field to produce a star cluster with regions of enhanced\nstar formation. In our framework, the SN Ia (and AGB) pollution is the seed which may have led to the formation of\nthe globular cluster itself.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the anonymous referee whose comments improved\nthe presentation of the paper.
