Assuming the existence of critical\nexponents (as is known in the case of the triangular site lattice) if the power is less\nthan 1/\u03bd, with \u03bd the correlation length exponent, we demonstrate an infinite cluster\nwith scale dimension given by DH = 2 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bb. Further, we investigate the critical case\n\u03bbc = 1/\u03bd and show that iterated logarithmic corrections will tip the balance between\nthe possibility and impossibility of an infinite cluster.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA while ago, one of us \u2013 in collaboration with others \u2013 introduced a notion of inhomogeneous percolation [4] that was demonstrated to have some interesting properties.\nThe model is defined by allowing the density parameter to vary, e.g. with the distance\nto the origin, in such a way that the system will just barely house an infinite cluster.\nExplicitly, one looks at\n1\n(1.1)\np(r) \u223c\n= pc + \u03bb\nr\nwhere r denotes distance to the origin (and it should be assumed r is large enough\nso that the right\u2013hand side makes sense). For d = 2, under the assumption of the\nexistence of critical exponents, it was found that if \u03bb < \u03bbc = 1/\u03bd the origin belongs to\nan infinite cluster with positive probability, while this probability vanishes if \u03bb > \u03bbc .\nIn the preceding, \u03bd is the correlation length exponent \u2013 precise definitions later \u2013 and,\nin fact, an equivalent but more awkward statement can be made without reference\nto exponents. For \u03bb < \u03bbc , we will refer to the infinite object as the inhomogeneous\nincipient infinite cluster (IIIC).\n1\n\n\fIn the ensuing time, there have been two landmarks in 2D percolation, namely the\nworks of Kesten in the late 1980's ([8], [9], [10]) wherein critical scaling relations were\nestablished modulo the existence of certain critical exponents, and the more recent\nworks by (various combinations of) Lawler, Schramm, Smirnov and Werner ([12], [11],\n[13]) where the existence of these exponents \u2013 and their values \u2013 was established for\nthe case of the triangular site lattice using the connection, in the scaling limit, to\nthe Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with parameter 6. Thus, most of the original\nresults can be sharpened at least in certain cases. However, such matters are largely\nautomatic.\nThe main result of this note concerns the large scale structure of the percolating\ncluster. In particular, it turns out that these objects have a well\u2013defined Hausdorff\ndimension (more precisely scale\u2013dimension) that is given by\nDH = 2 \u2212 \u03b2\u03bb\n\n(1.2)\n\nfor 0 < \u03bb < \u03bbc , where \u03b2 is the percolation density, or order parameter exponent. It\nis noted that as \u03bb \u2193 \u03bbc this dimension matches that of the standard IIC as discussed\nin e.g. [14], [15] and proved, modulo the existence of exponents, in [8]. Further,\nwe discuss the borderline case, informally p(r) \u2212 pc = r\u22121/\u03bd K(r) where K(r) is a\n\"correction\". It turns out that at the border, the balance is very delicate and\nK(r) \u223c [log log r]1/\u03bd\n\n(1.3)\n\nwill determine the presence or absence of infinite structures. All results save the\nlatter can be stated without apology for the triangular site model; a statement along\nthe lines of Eq.(1.3) requires strong existence of power laws which, at this time, has\nnot been established, and we will be content with a statement that circumvents this\nnecessity.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSetup and Statement of Theorems\nSetting\n\nWe consider any of the standard 2D percolation models \u2013 explicitly any model for\nwhich the results of [8] \u2013 [10] can be established. In particular, what is needed is\nreflection symmetry about one of the coordinate axes and overall rotational invariance\nby any angle in (0, \u03c0). However, it is sufficient that the reader keeps in mind only the\nbond or site problems on the square or triangular lattice (unfortunately, the latter\n2\n\n\frequires the use of parallelograms rather than rectangles and, since the triangular\nsite model is where the strongest results are known, we are forced to carry this\nterminology).\nFor the purposes of this note, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the\nstandard fare associated with these sorts of percolation problems; additional background material can be found in the reference [6].\nLet us now fix some working notation/definitions: we take the vertical axis to\nbe the axis of reflection symmetry and r(z) = kzk\u221e (abv. kzk since, in any case,\nall norms are equivalent) will denote the infinity norm of a site z as measured with\nrespect to the x\u2013axis and the axis related to this by the angle of rotation symmetry.\nThe set of points at distance at most N from a site z is a rhombus centered at this\nsite and whose sides line up with the above mentioned axes. It will be denoted by\nSN (z), its boundary being the set \u2202SN (z) of points at distance exactly N from z. We\nwill refer to SN (0) simply as SN . We will often use the fact that\n|SN (z)| \u2264 C0 N 2\n\n(2.1)\n\nfor some constant C0 that may depend on the lattice.\nBonds or sites (as appropriate) will be occupied with probability p and vacant with\nprobability 1 \u2212 p, independently of each other. We denote by P\u221e (p) the probability\nthat the site at the origin is connected to infinity, and by pc \u2208 (0, 1) the percolation\nthreshold: P\u221e (p) > 0 iff p > pc . If A and B are sets (which, for convenience, will\ninclude the case \"infinity\"), then we use the notation A\nB to denote the event\nthat some site in A is connected to some site in B. If the connection is required to\ntake place using exclusively the sites of some other set C, we write A C B. Finally,\nall quantities adorned by an \u2217 will pertain to the dual model.\nWe will make use of the following one\u2013arm probability\n\u03c0(N ) := Ppc ({0\n\n\u2202SN })\n\n(2.2)\n\nand, in addition,\n\u03c0(n|N ) := Ppc ({\u2202Sn\n\n\u2202SN }).\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe so-called Russo-Seymour-Welsh theory (see e.g. [6]) implies that\n\u03c0(n|2N ), \u03c0(bn/2c|N ) \u2265 D1 \u03c0(n|N )\nand\n\"\nD2\n\nn\nN\n\n#\u03bc\n\n\"\n\u2264 \u03c0(n|N ) \u2264 D3\n3\n\nn\nN\n\n(2.4)\n\n#\u03bc0\n(2.5)\n\n\ffor some constants 0 < D1 , D2 , D3 , \u03bc, \u03bc0 < \u221e. We will later have use for \u03bc < 2 so we\nmay as well take \u03bc = 12 (this may be derived by a variant of the \"example\" (3.15)\nin [2] where one now uses blocks of size n instead of individual sites to obtain that\nN 2\n\u03c0 (n|N ) is bounded below by a constant). Finally, we also have\nn\nD4 \u03c0(n0 |n2 ) \u2264 \u03c0(n0 |n1 ) \u00d7 \u03c0(n1 |n2 ) \u2264 D5 \u03c0(n0 |n2 )\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhenever n0 < n1 < n2 , for some 0 < D4 , D5 < \u221e.\n\n2.2\n\nCorrelation Lengths\n\nWe will assume throughout that p > pc , as this is the only case we are interested in.\nThe primary correlation length used in this note, describing connection probabilities,\nwill be defined via the dual model: let z \u2217 denote a site on the dual lattice and let\n\u03c40\u2217\u2217,z\u2217 (p) denote the probability of a dual connection between the dual origin and z \u2217 ,\ni.e. the event {0\u2217 \u2217 z \u2217 }. Finally, let \u03c4n\u2217 (p) denote the maximum of such connection\nprobabilities with kz \u2217 k (= kz \u2217 k\u221e ) within a lattice spacing of n. Then, the correlation\nlength \u03be(p) is defined by\n1\n1\nlim [\u03c4n\u2217 (p)] n = e\u2212 \u03be(p)\n(2.7)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwith \u03be = 0 if p = 1. As is well known, the function \u03be is continuous, monotone and\ndivergent at p = pc ; the power of p \u2212 pc with which this function purportedly diverges\n\"defines\" the exponent \u03bd. Further, for future reference, the functions \u03c40\u2217\u2217,z\u2217 obey the\na priori bounds\n\u03c40\u2217\u2217,z\u2217 (p)\n\n\u2264e\n\n\u2212\n\nkz \u2217 k\n\u03be(p)\n\n.\n\n(2.8)\n\n \u0303 of\nAnother frequently used correlation length is the (quadratic) mean radius \u03be(p)\na finite cluster, defined by\n#1/2\n\n\"\n\nX\n1\n \u0303 =\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03be(p)\nkzk2 Pp {0\nEp |C(0)|; |C(0)| < \u221e z\n\n\u0001\nz} and |C(0)| < \u221e\n\n.\n\n(2.9)\n\nWe shall also have use for an auxiliary correlation length \u2013 often called finite\u2013size\ncorrelation length \u2013 which we will denote by L(p); technically this depends on an\nadditional parameter \u03b4 which will be notationally suppressed. In this note, the length\nL(p) will be defined as the smallest 3 \u00d7 1 parallelogram \u2013 with the short angle being\nthe angle of the rotation symmetry \u2013 such that the probability of an occupied crossing\nexceeds 1 \u2212 c\u03b4. Here c is a particular constant of order unity and \u03b4 may be chosen\n4\n\n\farbitrarily in (0, 1)1 . The key item is that if the above mentioned estimate on the\ncrossing probability is satisfied then, upon tripling the length scale, the improved\nestimate becomes 1 \u2212 c\u03b4 3 , so that on further rescalings, crossing probabilities tend to\none exponentially fast. In particular, for all n, all p > pc , the probability of a dual\ncrossing of an n \u00d7 3n parallelogram is bounded above by a constant times e\u2212n/L(p) ,\nwhich implies that\nP\u221e (p) \u2265 c0 Pp ({0\n\u2202SL(p) })\n(2.10)\nfor some universal constant 0 < c0 < \u221e.\nIt is noted that for length scales smaller than L(p), crossing probabilities of these\nshorter and longer parallelograms are bounded above and below by strictly positive\nconstants that depend only on the aspect ratio, as this is the situation at p = pc on\nall length scales. This is proved by a variant of the Russo\u2013Seymour\u2013Welsh theorem,\nsee e.g. the relevant lemmas in [7] Ch. 6. Obviously, the same kind of bounds hold\nfor dual crossings.\n \u0303 are uniformly bounded above and below\nIt was shown in [10] that L(p) and \u03be(p)\nby (\u03b4 dependent) multiples of one another, that is, in the notation of Kesten,\n \u0303\nL(p) \u0010 \u03be(p).\nIt was mentioned in [3] that the relation \u03be(p) \u0010 L(p) was known; however to the authors' knowledge, there is no published proof. In any case, at least for 2D percolation\nproblems, it is not hard to show it \u2013 we will provide the details in a short appendix \u2013\nthus all these correlation lengths are equivalent. To define the model we have a slight\npreference for \u03be, which is continuous and monotone, but for proofs the length L will\nmost often be more practical.\nFinally, as alluded to above, concerning asymptotic issues, we will use Kesten's\nnotations: for two positive functions f and g, f \u0010 g means that there exist two\npositive and finite constants Ca and Cb such that Ca g \u2264 f \u2264 Cb g (so that their\nratio is bounded away from 0 and +\u221e), whereas f \u2248 g means that log f /log g \u2192 1\n(\"logarithmic equivalence\"). These items will refer to p \u2192 pc or N \u2192 \u221e depending\non the context.\nKesten proved in [10] than the one\u2013arm probability stays of the same order of\nmagnitude if we do not go beyond the characteristic scale: more precisely,\nPp (0\n\n\u2202Sn ) \u0010 Ppc (0\n\n1\n\n\u2202Sn )\n\n(2.11)\n\nKesten proved in fact the following in [10]: for any (fixed) \u03b41 , \u03b42 \u2208 (0, 1), we have L(p, \u03b41 ) \u0010\nL(p, \u03b42 ).\n\n5\n\n\funiformly in p and n \u2264 L(p). In particular, we can combine it with Eq.(2.10):\nP\u221e (p) \u0010 Pp ({0\n\n\u2202SL(p) }) \u0010 Ppc ({0\n\n\u2202SL(p) }).\n\n(2.12)\n\nThis result (stated also in [10]) will prove to be very useful when dealing with small\nboxes on which the parameter does not vary too much.\n\n2.3\n\nDescription of the Model\n\nWe let \u03b1 : [0, +\u221e) \u2192 (0, 1 \u2212 pc ] denote the inverse function of \u03be with argument of\nthe increment above threshold:\n\u03be(pc + \u03b1(r)) = r.\n\n(2.13)\n\nLetting w \u2208 (0, 1), our inhomogeneous density will be defined by\np(z) := pc + \u03b5(r) = pc + \u03b1(rw ),\n\n(2.14)\n\nstill with r = r(z) = kzk. It is noted that this gives \u03be(pc + \u03b5(r)) = rw which will be\nthe starting point of our analyses. We will denote the corresponding measure by P\u0303w\nand expectations therein by \u1ebcw .\nRemark 1. It is noted that the formulation in Eq.(2.14) has the slight advantage\nover the informal description featured in the introduction that it is well-defined at all\npoints of the lattice. Moreover, in cases such as the triangular site percolation model\nwhere a logarithmic form of scaling can be established, i.e.\n\u03be(p) \u2248 |p \u2212 pc |\u2212\u03bd\n\n(p \u2193 pc )\n\n(2.15)\n\nwe make direct contact with the more informal description.

We will establish the above for all r sufficiently large but it is remarked that\njust how large is sufficient may depend on w. Let us start with the first case; here,\nfor various reasons, it is worthwhile to know that the connection to infinity can be\nachieved by moving outward from the immediate vicinity of the point z. Consider\nthe event A` (z) that an occupied ring separates \u2202S` (z) from S 1 `(r(z)) (z). Once A` (z)\n3\nhas occurred, with a few more parallelogram crossings, the separating circuit can be\nattached to a crossing of a 3`(r) \u00d7 `(r) parallelogram that is heading, more or less, in\na direction away from the origin. We further intersect this with a few more crossings\non a few more scales \u2013 each scale 3 times the previous one. The number of times we\nmust do this, which is on the order of just a few and not dependent on r will be made\nprecise momentarily; the relevant crossings are depicted in Figure 1. Denoting the\nintersection of the annular event and the crossing events alluded to by B` we have,\nby FKG,\nP\u0303w ({z\n\n\u2202S` (z)} \u2229 B` ) \u2265 P\u0303w ({z\n\n\u2202S` (z)})P\u0303w (B` ) \u2265 B P\u0303w ({z\n\n\u2202S` (z)})\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere B is the probability of B` at p = pc .

Here, by Eq.(2.14)\n(the definition of p(z)), the local correlation length has7 grown to 2w its size at the\ndistance r. Let us estimate the finite\u2013size correlation length. First we let c3 and c4\ndenote the constants by which the two correlation lengths may be compared:\nc3 L(p) \u2264 \u03be(p) \u2264 c4 L(p).\n\n(3.5)\n\n\u22121\nw\nThen, it is seen that L(pc + \u03b5(2r)) \u2264 2w c4 c\u22121\n3 L(pc + \u03b5(r)) = 2 c4 c3 `(r), and it is clear\nthat everywhere in the annular region S2r (0) \\ Sr (0), the effective finite\u2013size scaling\ncorrelation length is going to be uniformly smaller. The constant 2w c4 c\u22121\n3 determines\nthe scale of our initial cluster (which, we recall, is attached to the annular ring which\nin turn is connected to z). Having achieved this scale we are beyond the correlation\nlength as defined by the distance 2r. Using p(2r) as a bound for the density in the\n\n9\n\n\fannular region, it is not of much cost to connect this cluster out to \u2202S2r (0). This may\nbe done, e.g. by a standard \"rectangle rescaling program\" \u2013 constructing overlapping\nk\ncrossings the k th of which has probability in excess of 1 \u2212 c\u03b4 3 and whose scale is 3k\ntimes that of the original aggregation. Note however, that we have to have taken r\nlarge enough so that 2w c4 c\u22121\n3 `(r) \u2264 r.\nWe have thus hooked the point z to a cluster that connects \u2202Sr (0) to \u2202S2r (0)\nat\nprobabilistic cost, beyond what is in Eq.(3.4), of no more than\nQ an additional\n3k\n(1\n\u2212\nc\u03b4\n)\n>\n0\n\u2013 again using repeatedly the FKG inequality. The scale r cluster\nk\ncan now be directed to infinity by straightforward arguments (of a similar nature)\nwhich may be directly taken from [4] Theorem 2.\nThe second bound, Eq.(3.2), is proved in a similar fashion \u2013 actually easier because, aesthetics aside, we are forced to work inwards. The first few steps are identical:\nassuming that {z\n\u2202S` (z)} has occurred, we use the event A` (z) and some more\ncrossings to hook z up to a 3`(r) \u00d7 `(r) crossing \u2013 this time headed in the general\ndirection of coordinate decrease. But now, agreeing to always head inwards, we may\ndo a \u00d73 rescaling program without apology since p(z) is only getting bigger. Thus,\nwe continue till we reach the boundary of Sr/2 (0), again at a cost of no more than\nQ\n3k\nk (1\u2212c\u03b4 ) > 0. With probability that is (stretched exponentially) close to one there\nis an occupied ring in Sr (0)\\Sr/2 (0); this may be obtained by summing Eq. (2.8) over\nboth boundaries. Finally, with non\u2013zero probability, the event {0\n\u2202Sr (0)} occurs\nand it is clear that the intersection of all these events produces the event {z SN 0}.\nAs before, we have made repeated use of FKG and it is noted that the probabilities\nof all the relevant events save {z\n\u2202S` (z)} are of order unity independent of z.\nProof of Theorem 2.1. The above lemma proves almost completely the portion of\nTheorem 2.1 which concerns expectations. Indeed, for a uniform system,\nP\u221e (p) \u0010 \u03c0(L(p))\n\n(3.6)\n\nby Eq.(2.12), so the summand in Eq.(2.17) may be replaced by \u03c0(rw (z)) (as `(r) \u0010 rw\nby Eq.(3.3)), and it is easily seen that \u03c0(rw (z)) \u0010 P\u0303w ({z\n\u2202S` (z)}): indeed, as z 0\nvaries throughout S` (z), the local correlation length varies by a fractional amount\nwhich is only of the order [r(z)]\u2212(1\u2212w) . So, we may as well estimate by the largest\nvalue of p within S` (z) and use the associated slightly smaller\nL. But then, using\nP\nbounds as in Eq.(2.4) and Eq.(2.12), we get that IN \u0010 z\u2208SN P\u0303w ({z\n\u2202S` (z)}),\nwhich is our asymptotic expression for \u1ebcw (\u03a8N ).\nBefore we dispense with \u1ebcw (\u03a6N ) let us first verify the (asymptotic) evaluation of\nthe quantity IN . We already have that\n10\n\n\fIN \u0010\n\nX\n\n\u03c0(rw (z)).\n\n(3.7)\n\nz\u2208SN\n\nLet us take a logarithmic division of SN : define k = k(N ) so that 2k < N \u2264 2k+1 ,\nthen\nX\nIN \u0010\n(2j )2 \u03c0(2jw ) + E(k)\n(3.8)\nj\u2264k\n\nwhere E(k) is no more than the order of N 2 \u03c0(N w ). In the above, we have used\nEq.(2.4) on more than one occasion. Obviously, the purported principal term is at\nleast of this order so there is no further need to consider E. We pull out the leading\nterm in the sum:\nX\n\n(2j )2 \u03c0(2jw ) \u0010 22k \u03c0(2kw )\n\nj\u2264k\n\nX\n\n22(j\u2212k)\n\nj\u2264k\n\n\u03c0(2jw )\n\u03c0(2kw )\n\n(3.9)\n\nNow we use the fact that \u03c0(2wk )/\u03c0(2wj ) \u0010 \u03c0(2wj |2wk ) (using Eq.(2.6)) so that the\ncoefficient of 22k \u03c0(2kw ) (which is also at least as large as the order of unity because\nof the last term in the sum) is no more than\nc\u03035 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n2\u2212q(2\u2212w\u03bc) < \u221e\n\n(3.10)\n\nq=0\n\nsince \u03bc is certainly less than two. It is obvious given Eq.(3.7) for IN that \u1ebc(\u03a6N ) is\n(asymptotically) bounded above by IN and below by I N which by now, are seen to\n2\nbe comparable to each other.\nP Let us turn now to the variance bound.

We introduce\nthe enhanced length l(r) = `(r)r\u000f (which is still \u001c r) and as above, we abbreviate\n11\n\n\fSl(kxk) (x) by Sl (x). We denote by Fx0 the event {x\n\u2202Sl (x)}.

Whenever x is in Snc , we replace Fx with Fx0 and\nsimilarly for y; the error incurred is accounted for in the second term (and we have\nassumed that n is large enough so that the bound in Eq.(3.11) is safely in effect).\nThe last two terms are self\u2013explanatory and will be dispensed with below.\nc\nand x \u2208 Sn , it is observed that, for n\nLet us start with the first sum. For y \u2208 S3n\nlarge enough, Sl (y) is disjoint from Sn . Suppose that an occupied circuit surrounding\nSl (y) separates it from Sn . Now the event Fy0 depends only on the configuration inside\nSl (y) while (conditioning on the innermost such ring) the event Fx depends only on\nthe configuration outside and, perhaps, including the ring. I.e. given such a ring, the\nevents Fx and Fy0 are conditionally independent. The probability of Fy0 is unchanged\nwhile the probability of Fx and the ring event is bounded above by P\u0303w (Fx ) alone.\nc\nThus we learn for y \u2208 S3n\nand x \u2208 Sn that\nP\u0303w (Fx \u2229 Fy0 ) \u2212 P\u0303w (Fx )P\u0303w (Fy0 )\n\u2264 P\u0303w ({no occupied circuit separates Sn from Sl (y)}).\n\n(3.12)\nb\n\nThe right\u2013hand side of Eq.(3.12) is bounded by another term of the order e\u2212n and\nwe may thus absorb the entire first sum into the second error term at the expense of\nshifting the index of the constant.\nWe turn attention to the final term in the above written bound on the variance. If\nx and y are distant enough, Sl (x) and Sl (y) are disjoint, and the events Fx0 and Fy0 are\nindependent.

This is\nidentical to the previous argument: pulling out an overall factor of [2k \u03c0(2k )]2 , the\nresulting summand may be expressed as [\u03c0(2j | 2k )22(k\u2212j) ]\u22121 , and if we use the bound\nin Eq.(2.5) with \u03bc < 2, we see\nX\n22j \u03c0(2j )\u03c0(2k ) \u2264 C6 [2k \u03c0(2k )]2 .\n(3.16)\nj\u2264k\n\nThis is somewhat smaller than the contribution from the well\u2013separated terms (Eq.(3.15))\nso, overall,\n\u03a3w (x) \u2264 C7 l2 (kxk)\u03c0 2 (`(kxk)).\n(3.17)\nWe finally sum on x to conclude\nb\n\n\u1e7cw (\u03a8N ) \u2264 17C02 n4 + C2 N 4 e\u2212n + 2\n\nX\n\n\u03a3w (x)\n\nx\u2208SN \\Sn\nk(N )\n\n\u2264\n\n17C02 n4\n\n4 \u2212nb\n\n+ C2 N e\n\n+ C7 N\n\n2\u000f\n\nX\n\n22j 22wj \u03c0 2 (2jw ).\n\nj=1\n\nIn the above, all indexed constants are numbers which are uniformly of order unity.\nAs in previous arguments, we may bound the sum by a constant times N 2+2w \u03c0 2 (N w )\nand, finally, we choose n a small enough power of N so that n4 is relatively negligible\n\u2013 which will still easily diminishes the other \"error term\". Recalling that IN2 \u2248\nN 4 \u03c0 2 (N w ) \u2013 and that w + \u000f < 1 \u2013 we have obtained the desired statement about\n\u1e7cw (\u03a8N ).\nConcerning \u03a6N , although we have to be a bit more cautious, the proof remains\nessentially the same. Here we can write\n\u1e7cw (\u03a6N | {0\n\"\nX\nP\u0303w ({x\n\n\u221e}) =\n#\n0, y\n\n0}|{0\n\n\u221e})\n\nP\u0303w (Fx \u2229 Fy \u2229 {0\n\u221e}) P\u0303w (Fx \u2229 {0\n\u221e})P\u0303w (Fy \u2229 {0\n\u2212\nP\u0303w ({0\n\u221e})\nP\u0303w ({0\n\u221e})2\n\n\u221e})\n\n0}|{0\n\n\u221e}) \u2212 P\u0303w ({x\n\n0}|{0\n\n\u221e})P\u0303w ({y\n\nx,y\u2208SN\n\n\"\n=\n\nX\nx,y\u2208SN\n\nWe again cut out a central portion at the cost of the order n4 and we are left with\ntwo principal contributors the first of which is given by (twice) the sum with x \u2208 Sn\n14\n\n#\n\n\fc\nand y \u2208 S3n\n. Here, using another argument involving a separating ring, the positive\nterm is bounded as follows:\n\nP\u0303w (Fx \u2229 Fy | {0\n\n\u221e}) \u2264 P\u0303w (Fx | {0\n\n\u221e})P\u0303w (Fy0 ) + NR\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhere NR is the \"no ring\" event described in Eq.(3.12).

Here in addition we will replace {0\n\u221e}\nby the event\n(x,y)\n\nF0\n\n= {0\n\n\u221e outside of Sl (x) \u222a Sl (y)} (= {0\n\n[Sl (x)\u222aSl (y)]c\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\n\u221e}).\n\n(3.19)\n\nIt is not hard to see that the two events are very close. Indeed while ostensibly\n(x,y)\nF0\n\u2283 {0\n\u221e}, in the event that Sl (x) and Sl (y) are both surrounded by occupied\ncircuits which separate these boxes from the origin, the conditional probability is\nlarger. But since we are well away from the origin these sorts of separating rings occur\nwith probability close to one and we get an upper bound similar to that of Eq.(3.11)\n(x,y)\nfor P\u0303w (F0 \u2206{0\n\u221e}). The remainder of the proof is essentially identical.\n\n4\n\nA Sharp Transition\n\nTo treat the marginal case, we take\np(z) := pc + \u03b5(r) = pc + \u03b1(r/\u03ba log log(r))\n\n(4.1)\n\nwith \u03ba a constant and it is assumed that r is large enough so that all quantities are\npositive (otherwise, we set p = 1). We denote by P\u03031,\u03ba the associated inhomogeneous\nprobability measure. Note that this gives \u03be(pc + \u03b5(r)) = r/\u03ba log log(r) which is hardly\ndistinguishable from linear in r. Nevertheless, we will prove\nTheorem 4.1 For the 2D inhomogeneous percolation models defined via Eq.(4.1),\nthere is a critical value \u03bac \u2208 (0, +\u221e) such that for \u03ba > \u03bac there exists P\u03031,\u03ba \u2013 a.s. an\ninfinite cluster, while for \u03ba < \u03bac there is P\u03031,\u03ba \u2013 a.s. no infinite cluster.\n\n15\n\n\fProof. By monotonicity, it suffices to prove that there exists a value of \u03ba for which\nthe system percolates, and another value for which it does not percolate. We start\nwith the percolative part.\nConsider the crossing of any 3r \u00d7 r parallelogram that is situated so that the\nmaximum distance form the origin is no more than M r with M a (uniform) constant\nof order unity. Within this parallelogram, the lowest value of p estimates a uniform\nvalue for the density. This in turn provides a finite\u2013size scaling correlation length\nwhich is smaller than r/[q1 log log r] for some constant, q1 , which is large if \u03ba is large.\nBy starting at this length scale, and instituting an \u00d73 rescaling program till the scale\nof the 3r \u00d7 r is reached, it is seen that the probability of a crossing at the larger scale\nis at least 1 \u2212 Q1 \u03b4 q1 log log r . Here Q1 is a constant of order unity \u2013 perhaps small \u2013 but\nindependent of r and \u03ba. Writing \u03b4 as an exponential this bounds the probability of\ncrossing the parallelogram at scale r below by 1 \u2212 Q2 /(log r)q2 where Q2 is of order\nunity independent of r and \u03ba and q2 is large if \u03ba is large.\nWe now consider a sequence of overlapping 3 \u00d7 1 parallelograms at a sequence of\nscales with each scale thrice the previous one. Here the sequence is such that the\nsmallest scale is in the vicinity of the origin and the event of simultaneous crossings\nof all of them (or all but a finite number of them) implies the existence of an infinite\ncluster. 2 If the scale of the k th rectangle is simply a constant times 3k , the P\u03031,\u03ba\nprobability of seeing all the crossings is bounded below by\n\u0015\nY\u0014\nQ3\ng(\u03ba) =\n1 \u2212 q2\nk\nk\n(with Q3 another uniform constant) which is positive for all \u03ba large enough. The\nquantity g(\u03ba) bounds the probability that the origin belongs to an infinite cluster,\nthe a.s. existence of an infinite cluster follows from an application of the Borel\u2013Cantelli\nlemma. It is remarked that by the consideration of large scale circuits \u2013 which are\npresent even at p = pc \u2013 the infinite cluster is a.s. unique.\nFor the non\u2013percolative result, when \u03ba is small, we shall consider events in the\nannular regions S3r \\ Sr . Within this region, L(p(z)) is now uniformly larger than\nr/[a1 log log r] where a1 is small if \u03ba is small. This implies that the long\u2013way crossings\nof 4 \u00d7 1 parallelograms occur with probability of order unity. These crossings may\nbe stitched together, e.g. in a square\u2013wave fashion, to construct a dual circuit in the\n2\n\nE.g. in the \"T\" construction in [4], which the reader may wish to check, there are two rectangles\nat each scale; although one of them was 4 \u00d7 1 this was only for aesthetic reasons and, in any case, the\nabove mentioned bounds on crossing probabilities are easily extended to parallelograms with any\nfinite aspect ratio.\n\n16\n\n\fa sequence\nof overlapping\n3\u00d7\n1 parallelograms\nat a s\nof all of them (orWe\nallnow\nbut consider\na finite number\nof them)\nimplies the\nexistence\nof an infinite\n2\nth\nk\nwith ofeach\nthrice theisprevious\nHere times\nthe sequence\nis1,\u03basuc\ncluster.\nIfscales\nthe scale\nthescale\nk rectangle\nsimply aone.\nconstant\n3 the P\u0303\nscale\nin the vicinity\nof thebelow\noriginbyand the event of simultaneou\nprobability ofsmallest\nseeing all\ntheiscrossings\nis bounded\nof all of them (or all but a finite number of them) implies the existence of\n\ufffd th Q3\ncluster. 2 If the scale\nof\nthe\nk \u2212 rectangle\nis simply a constant times 3\ng(\u03ba) =\n[1\n]\nq\n2\nk is bounded below by\nprobability of seeing all the crossings\nk\n\n\ufffd\nQ3\nis positive\n(with Q3 is another uniform constant) which g(\u03ba)\n=\n[1for\n\u2212 allq2 ]\u03ba large enough.

Let us start by defining R3,N (p) to be the probability of a\nlong\u2013way crossing of a 3N \u00d7 N parallelogram and D3,N = 1 \u2212 R3,N the probability of\nthe complimentary event, namely a short\u2013way dual\u2013crossing of this shape. First, it\nis claimed that\n1\n1\nN\nlim D3,N\n= e\u2212 \u03be .\n(5.1)\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212N\n\u03be\n\nIndeed, D3,N \u2264 V1 N 2 e\nby the a priori bounds discussed in Eq.(2.8) where V1 is\na uniform constant (equal to 9 on the square lattice). On the other hand, we may\nobtain a lower bound for D3,N by just allowing the site at the center of the base to\nconnect to its counterpart across the way. While, ostensibly, this would allow for\n17\n\n\fpaths to \"leak out the ends\", it is not hard to show that the probability of such a\n3 N\nhuge lateral excursion is as small as e\u2212 2 \u03be so, for all intents and purposes, D3,N & \u03c4N\u2217\nwhich establishes the limit. Using the 3\u00d7 construction discussed at several points\nearlier in the text and using e.g. \u03b4 = e\u22121 , we get that\nk\n\nR3,3k L \u2265 1 \u2212 ce\u22123 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nN\n\nThus, for some sequence of N 's, D3,N \u2264 ce\u2212 L which implies e\u22121/\u03be \u2264 e\u22121/L . Now\nconsider the probability of a hard\u2013way dual crossing of a 4 \u00d7 1 parallelogram of scale\nL0 which is less than L but, say, larger than 21 L. This occurs with a probability of\norder unity independent of p (by Russo-Seymour-Welsh theory) and, as was just done\nin the last proof, by stitching together the order of N/L such rectangles the desired\nN\nevent is produced. Thus we have D3,N \u2265 e\u2212\u03c3 L for some constant \u03c3 (which is uniform\nin p) and hence e\u22121/\u03be \u2265 e\u2212\u03c3/L .\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to the IPAM institute at UCLA for their hospitality and\nsupport during the \"Random Shapes Conference\" which was supported by the NSF\nunder the grant DMS-0439872.
