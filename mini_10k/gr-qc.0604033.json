Recent developments on higher\u2013dimensional gravity resulted in a number of interesting theoretical ideas\nsuch as the brane world concept. The essence of this\nstring inspired model is that Standard Model fields are\nconfined to a three dimensional hypersurface, the brane,\nwhile gravity propagates in the full spacetime, the bulk.\nThe simplest models in this context (abbreviated here as\nRSI and RSII), proposed by Randall and Sundrum [3],\ndescribe our world as a domain wall embedded in a Z2 symmetric five dimensional anti\u2013de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The RSI model proposes a mechanism to solve the\nhierarchy problem by a small extra dimension, while the\nRSII model considers an infinite extra dimension with a\nwarp factor which ensures the localization of gravity on\nour brane.\nBlack holes are important sources of gravitational\nwaves that are expected to be detected by the current and upcoming generation of experiments. This will\nopen up a new window for testing modifications of general relativity. The simplest case of gravitational collapse in the standard four dimensional world is described\nby the 4-dimensional Schwarzschild metric. In the 5dimensional scenario it would be natural to ask whether\nmatter confined on the brane after undergoing gravitational collapse can still be described by a Schwarzschildtype metric. The most natural generalization in the\nRSII model corresponds to a black string infinite in the\nfifth dimension, whose induced metric on the brane is\npurely Schwarzschild [4]. However, although the cur-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\neabdalla@fma.if.usp.br\nbertha@fma.if.usp.br\nalan@fma.if.usp.br\ncmolina@usp.br\n\nvature scalars are everywhere finite, the Kretschmann\nscalar diverges at the AdS horizon at infinity, which turns\nthe above solution into a physically unsuitable object.\nIt has been argued that there exists a localized black\ncigar solution with a finite extension along the extra dimension due to a Gregory-Laflamme [5] type of instability near the AdS horizon. A class of such a solution has\nbeen found by Casadio et al. [6, 7] using the projected\nEinstein equations on the brane derived by Shiromizu et\nal. [8]. It has the desired \"pancake\" horizon structure\nensuring a non-singular behavior in the curvature and\nKretschmann scalars at least until the order of the multipole expansion considered there. In fact, this solution\nbelongs to a class of black hole solutions found later by\nBronnikov et al. [9], who also classified several possible brane black holes obtained from the Shiromizu et al.\nprojected equations [8] in two families according to the\nhorizon order. For such spacetimes only horizons of order\n1 or 2 are possible, but not higher than that.\nIn this paper we are interested in the study of black\nholes from the point of view of a brane observer, as ourselves. We analyze some characteristics of Bronnikov et\nal. solutions. Firstly, some aspects of the thermodynamics are studied. Black Hole Thermodynamics was\nconstructed when Bekenstein proposed the proportionality law between the entropy and the horizon area [10].\nThe discovery of Hawking radiation validated this proposal and established the proportionality factor 1/4 in\na precise way [11] leading to the well-known BekensteinHawking formula,\nSBH =\n\nArea\n.\n4G\n\n(1)\n\nOne way to compute the entropy based on a semiclassical description of a scalar field was proposed by 't\nHooft [12] and it is known as the brick wall method, which\nwas frequently used later in several contexts [13]. When\napplying this method to a Schwarzschild black hole, 't\nHooft found that the entropy was proportional to the\narea, as expected, but additionally it had a \u03b1\u22122 correction, \u03b1 being the proper distance from the horizon to\n\n\f2\nthe wall. This term was later interpreted as a one-loop\ncorrection to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, since it\ncan be absorbed as a renormalization of the gravitational\ncoupling constant G [14].\nAnother interesting feature of black hole thermodynamics is the existence of an upper bound on the entropy\nof any neutral system of energy E and maximal radius\nR in the form S \u2264 2\u03c0ER, proposed by Bekenstein [15].\nThis bound becomes necessary in order to enforce the\ngeneralized second law of thermodynamics (GSL).\nBesides thermodynamical results, we also consider the\nresponse of a brane black hole perturbation which should\nrepresent some damped oscillating signal. It can be decomposed with Laplace transformation techniques into a\nset of so-called quasinormal modes (QNM). The QNMs\nof black holes are important because they dominate in\nthe intermediate late-time decay of a perturbation and\ndo not depend upon the way they were excited. They\ndepend only on the parameters of a black hole and are,\ntherefore, the \"footprints\" of this structure. The timeindependent problem for perturbations of a brane black\nhole turns out to be quite similar to that for a black hole:\none has to find the solutions of the wave-like equations\nsatisfying the appropriate boundary conditions, which we\nshall further discuss in detail.\nThe paper is organized as follows, in Sec. II the brane\nblack holes are presented. Sec. III discusses the thermodynamical properties of the solutions thus considered.\nSec. IV treats the question of perturbation and stability\nof these objects. Wave-like equations for the perturbations are derived. In Sec. V an analysis of the quasinormal modes and late-time behavior is developed. In Sec.\nVI we summarize our results, and some final comments\nare made.\n\nII.\n\nBRANE BLACK HOLE SOLUTIONS\n\nThe vacuum Einstein equations in 5 dimensions, when\nprojected on a 4-dimensional spacetime and after introducing gaussian normal coordinates (x\u03bc , with \u03bc = 0 . . . 3,\nand z), lead to the gravitational equation on the 3-brane\ngiven by [8]\n(4)\nR\u03bc\u03bd\n\n=\n\n(4)\n\u039b4 g\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u2212 E\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u039b4 is the brane cosmological constant, and E\u03bc\u03bd is\nproportional to the (traceless) projection on the brane of\nthe 5-dimensional Weyl tensor.\nThe only combination of the Einstein equations in a\nbrane world that can be written unambiguously without\nspecifying E\u03bc\u03bd is their trace [6, 7, 9],\nR(4) = 4\u039b4 .\n\n(3)\n\nIt is clear that this equation, also known as the hamiltonian constraint in the ADM decomposition of the metric, is a weaker restriction than the purely 4-dimensional\n\nequation R\u03bc\u03bd = 0, which, in fact, is equivalent to Eq.\n(2), provided that we know the structure of E\u03bc\u03bd .\nIn order to obtain four dimensional solutions of Eq.\n(3), we choose the spherically symmetric form of the 4dimensional metric given by\nds2 = \u2212A(r)dt2 +\n\ndr2\n+ r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ) . (4)\nB(r)\n\nWe relax the condition A(r) = B(r), which is accidentally verified in four dimensions but, in fact, there is no\nreason for it to continue to be valid in this scenario. In\nthis spirit, black hole and wormhole solutions [6, 9, 16, 17]\nas well as star solutions on the brane [18] have been obtained in the last years. We should mention that even\nwithout relaxing this condition, previous solutions have\nalso been found [19, 20].\nIn this context the hamiltonian constraint can be written explicitly in terms of A and B as [6, 9]\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012\n\u0013#\n1 A\u2032 B \u2032\n1 A\u2032\n2 B\u2032\nA\u2032\nA\u2032\u2032\n+\nB\n\u2212\n+\n+\nA\n2 A\n2A B\nr B\nA\n\u2212\n\n2\n(1 \u2212 B) = 4\u039b4 ,\nr2\n\n(5)\n\nwith prime (') denoting differentiation with respect to r.\nWe will center our attention in the black hole type\nsolutions which can be obtained by one of the following\nalgorithms BH1 and BH2. These are subclasses of the\ncorresponding algorithms in [9] (where the parameter s\nin this reference is set to 1).\nFirst Algorithm (BH1): Specify a function A(r), positive\nand analytical in a neighborhood of the event horizon\nR[r], in such a way that 4A + rA\u2032 > 0 in R[r], and\nA \u2248 (r \u2212 rh ) as r \u2192 rh . Then B(r) is given by the\ngeneral solution of (5) with vanishing brane cosmological\nconstant,\nB(r) =\n\u00d7\n\n\u0014Z\n\nr\n\nrh\n\n2Ae3\u0393\nr(4A + rA\u2032 )2\n\n\u0015\n(4A + rA\u2032 )(2 \u2212 r2 R)e\u22123\u0393 dr + C ,\n\nwhere C is an integration constant and\nZ\nA\u2032\ndr .\n\u0393(r) =\n4A + rA\u2032\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nFor C \u2265 0 we have a black hole metric with a horizon at\nr = rh , which is simple if C > 0 and of the order 2 + p if\nboth C = 0, and Q has the behavior,\nQ(r) = 2 \u2212 r2 R \u2248 (r \u2212 rh )p , near r = rh , p \u2208 N . (8)\nSecond Algorithm (BH2): Specify a function A(r), positive and analytical in a neighborhood of the event horizon R[r], in such a way that 4A + rA\u2032 > 0 in R[r], and\nA \u2248 (r \u2212 rh )2 as r \u2192 rh . Then B(r) is again given by\n(6). The black hole metric appears when C = 0 with\n\n\f3\na horizon at r = rh of the order 2 + p if Q(r) behaves\naccording to (8).\nBoth algorithms lead to double horizons in the case\nC = 0, if Q(rh ) > 0. A case in point of the first algorithm\nis the solution with the metric element A(r) having the\nusual form of a Schwarzschild black hole found by Casadio, Fabbri, and Mazzacurati (CFM solution) [6, 7] given\nby\n2M\n,\nr\n(1 \u2212 2M\nr )(1 \u2212\nB(r) =\n1 \u2212 3M\n2r\nA(r) = 1 \u2212\n\nM\u03b3\n2r )\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is an integration constant. The event horizon is\nlocalized at rh = 2M and the singularity at r = 3M/2\ninstead of r = 0. Notice that the Schwarzschild solution\nis recovered with \u03b3 = 3. In this work we are restricted to\nthe case when \u03b3 < 4.\nAnother interesting example of this algorithm is the\nmetric with zero Schwarzschild mass [9] given by\nh2\nA(r) = 1 \u2212 2 , h > 0 ,\n\u0013\n\u0012 r 2\u0013\u0012\nC \u2212h\nh\n1+ \u221a\n,\nB(r) = 1 \u2212 2\nr\n2r2 \u2212 h2\n\n(10)\n\nBLACK HOLE THERMODYNAMICS\n\nIn order to study the thermodynamical properties of\nthe brane black holes generated by the BH1 and BH2\nalgorithms, we use the following expressions of the metric\ncoefficients near the horizon\nA(r) = A1 (r \u2212 rh ) + O((r \u2212 rh )2 )\n(11)\n2\n3\nB(r) = B1 C(r \u2212 rh ) + B2 (r \u2212 rh ) + O((r \u2212 rh ) ) ,\nfor BH1 algorithm with A1 , B1 , B2 > 0 and C being an\nintegration constant that defines the black hole family,\nand\nA(r) = A2 (r \u2212 rh )2 + O(r \u2212 rh )3 ,\nB(r) = B3 C + B4 (r \u2212 rh )2 + B5 (r \u2212 rh )3\n+O((r \u2212 rh )4 ) ,\n\nLet us consider an object with rest mass m and proper\nradius R descending into a BH2 black hole.

The singularity occurs at r = h/ 2. This example shows that in the brane world context a black hole\nmay exist without matter and without mass, only as a\ntidal effect from the bulk gravity. However, there is a special situation when h2 can be related to a 5-dimensional\nmass, namely, C = h. In this case Eq. (10) is the induced\nmetric of a 5-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, as described in [21], where the chosen background was ADDtype.\nIII.\n\nWe will show here the calculation for the BH2 family,\nwhich turns out to be more interesting, since the metric\ncoefficients expansion (12) is different from the standard\none (11). However, we will display certain quantities for\nboth families wherever it is relevant.\nWe first consider the issue of the entropy bound. The\nsurface gravity at the event horizon is given by\n( \u221a\n1\nfor BH1 family ,\n2 A1 B1 C\n\u03ba= \u221a\n(13)\nA2 B3 C\nfor BH2 family .\n\n(16)\n\nFor simplicity we just consider the equatorial motion of\nthe object, i.e., \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. The quadratic equation for the\nconserved energy E of the body coming from (14)-(16) is\ngiven by\n\u03b1E 2 \u2212 2\u03b2E + \u03b6 = 0 ,\n\n(17)\n\n\u03b1 = r2 ,\n\u03b2 = 0,\n\u03b6 = A2 (r \u2212 rh )2 (J 2 + m2 r2 ) .\n\n(18)\n\nwith\n\nThe gradual approach to the black hole must stop when\nthe proper distance from the body's center of mass to the\nblack hole horizon equals R, the body's radius,\nZ rh +\u03b4(R)\ndr\np\n= R.\n(19)\nB(r)\nrh\n\nIntegrating this equation we obtain the expression for \u03b4,\n\n\u03b4=\n\n(\n\n1\n2\nB1\n4 CR\n\u221a\n\nR B3 C\n\nfor BH1 family ,\nfor BH2 family .\n\n(20)\n\nSolving (17) for the energy and evaluating at the point\nof capture r = rh + \u03b4 we have\np\nA2 (J 2 + m2 rh2 ) \u03b4\nEcap \u2248\n(21)\nrh\nThis energy is minimal for a minimal increase in the black\nhole surface area, J = 0, such that\np\nEmin = A2 m \u03b4 .\n(22)\n\n\f4\nFrom the First Law of Black Hole Thermodynamics we\nknow that\ndM =\n\n\u03ba\ndAr ,\n2\n\n(23)\n\nrh +\u03b5\n\nwhere Ar is the rationalized area (Area/4\u03c0), and dM =\nEmin is the change in the black hole mass due to the\nassimilation of the body. Thus, using (13) we obtain\ndAr = 2mR .\n\n(24)\n\nAssuming the validity of the GSL, SBH (M + dM ) \u2265\nSBH (M ) + S, we derive an upper bound to the entropy\nS of an arbitrary system of proper energy E,\nS \u2264 2\u03c0ER .\n\n(25)\n\nThis result coincides with that obtained for the purely\n4-dimensional Schwarzschild solution, and it is also independent of the black hole parameters [15]. It shows that\nthe bulk does not affect the universality of the entropy\nbound.\nLet us find now the quantum corrections to the classical BH entropy. We consider a massive scalar field \u03a6 in\nthe background of a BH2 black hole satisfying the massive Klein-Gordon equation,\n\u0001\n\u0003 \u2212 m2 \u03a6 = 0 .\n(26)\n\nIn order to quantize this scalar field we adopt the statistical mechanical approach using the partition function\nZ, whose leading contribution comes from the classical\nsolutions of the euclidean lagrangian that leads to the\nBekenstein-Hawking formula. In order to compute the\nquantum corrections due to the scalar field we use the 't\nHooft's brick wall method, which introduces an ultraviolet cutoff near the horizon, such that\n\u03a6(r) = 0\n\nat r = rh + \u03b5 ,\n\n(27)\n\nand an infrared cutoff very far away from the horizon,\n\u03a6(r) = 0 at r = L \u226b M .\n\n(28)\n\nThus, using the black hole metric (4) and the Ansatz\n\u03a6 = e\u2212iEt R(r)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6), Eq.(26) turns out to be\nr\n\u0011\nE2\nB 1 \u0010 2\u221a\nAB\u2202\nR\nr\n\u2202\nR+\nr\nr\nA\nA r2\n\u0014\n\u0015\nl(l + 1)\n2\n\u2212\n+m R = 0.\nr2\n\n(29)\n\nUsing a first order WKB approximation with R(r) \u2248\ne\nin (29) and taking the real part of this equation we\ncan obtain the radial wave number K \u2261 \u2202r S as being,\niS(r)\n\nK = B \u22121/2\n\n\u0014\n\nE2\n\u2212\nA\n\n\u0012\n\nl(l + 1)\n+ m2\nr2\n\nNow we introduce the semiclassical quantization condition,\nZ L\n\u03c0 nr =\nK(r, l, E) dr .\n(31)\n\n\u0013\u00151/2\n\n.\n\n(30)\n\nIn order to compute the entropy of the system we first\ncalculate the Helmholtz free energy F of a thermal bath\nof scalar particles with temperature 1/\u03b2,\nZ\nZ\n1\ndl(2l + 1) dnr ln(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2E ) .\n(32)\nF =\n\u03b2\nIntegrating by parts, using (30) and (31), and performing\nthe integral in l we have\nZ L\nZ\n2\n(E 2 \u2212 Am2 )3/2\nF =\u2212\n.\ndr A\u22123/2 B \u22121/2 r2 dE\n3\u03c0 rh +\u03b5\ne\u03b2E \u2212 1\n(33)\nFollowing 't Hooft's method, the contribution of this\nintegral near the horizon is given by\nL\u0304\n\n\u221e\n\nE3\n,\ne\u03b2E \u2212 1\n0\n(34)\nwhere y = r/rh , \u03b5\u0304 = \u03b5/rh , and L\u0304 = L/rh .

PERTURBATIVE DYNAMICS: MATTER\nAND GRAVITATIONAL PERTURBATIONS\n\nFor simplicity we model the matter field by a scalar\nfield \u03a6 confined on the brane obeying the massless\n(m = 0) version of the Klein-Gordon equation (26). We\nexpect that massive fields (m 6= 0) should show rather\ndifferent tail behavior, but such cases will not be treated\nin the present paper.\nUsing the decomposition of the scalar field as\n\u03a8(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = R(t, r)Yl,m (\u03b8, \u03c6) in terms of the angular,\nradial, and time variables we have the equation\n\u2212\n\n\u2202 2 Rl\n\u2202 2 Rl\n+\n= Vsc (r(r\u22c6 ))Rl ,\n\u2202t2\n\u2202r\u22c62\n\nds2 = e2\u03bd dt2 \u2212 e2\u03c8 d\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c9dt \u2212 q2 d\u03b82 \u2212 q3 d\u03c62\n\u2212e2\u03bc2 dr2 \u2212 e2\u03bc3 d\u03b82\n\n(45)\n\n1\n, e2\u03bc3 = r2 , e2\u03c8 = r2 sin2 \u03b8 .\nB(r)\n(46)\nAxial perturbations in the brane metric (4) are characterized by non-null (but first order) values for \u03c9, q2 , and\nq3 in Eq. (45). We refer to [25] for further details.\nIn order to decouple the system, it is adopted the\nchange of variables\ne2\u03bd = A(r) , e2\u03bc2 =\n\nQ\u03b1\u03b2 = q\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2212 q\u03b2,\u03b1 ,\n\n(47)\n\nQ\u03b1 0 = q\u03b1,0 \u2212 \u03c9,\u03b1 ,\n\n(48)\n\nand\n\nwith \u03b1, \u03b2 = 2, 3. We denote partial differentiation with\nrespect to t, \u03b8 and \u03c6 by \",0\", \",1\" and \",2\", respectively.\nThe perturbations are then described by\n(42)\n\nThe effective potential Vsc is given by\n\nl(l + 1)\n1\n+\n[A(r) B \u2032 (r) + A\u2032 (r) B(r)] .\nr2\n2r\n(43)\nIn order to address the problem of black hole stability\nunder gravitational perturbations, we consider first order\nperturbation of R\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212E\u03b1\u03b2 , where R\u03b1\u03b2 and E\u03b1\u03b2 are\nthe Ricci tensor and the projection of the five dimensional\nWeyl tensor on the brane, respectively. In general, the\ngravitational perturbations depend on the tidal perturbations, namely, \u03b4E\u03b1\u03b2 . Since the complete bulk solution\nis not known, we shall use the simplifying assumption\n\u03b4E\u03b1\u03b2 = 0. This assumption can be justified at least in\na regime where the perturbation energy does not exceed\nthe threshold of the Kaluza-Klein massive modes. Analysis of gravitational shortcuts [24] also supports this simplification showing that gravitational fields do not travel\ndeep into the bulk. On the other hand, since we ignore\nbulk back-reaction, the developed perturbative analysis\nshould not describe the late-time behavior of gravitational perturbations. Within such premises we obtain\nthe gravitational perturbation equation\nVsc = A(r)\n\n\u03b4R\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 .\n\n\u0001\n\nwhere we adopt here a more convenient notation,\n\n(41)\n\nwith the tortoise coordinate r\u22c6 defined as\n1\ndr\u22c6 (r)\n= p\n.\ndr\nA(r)B(r)\n\ntreatment used in [25].

In addition, to check some results\nobtained in \"time\u2013dependent\" approach we employ the\nsemi-analytical WKB-type method developed in [29] and\nimproved in [30]. Both approaches show good agreement\nfor the fundamental overtone which is the dominating\ncontribution in the signal for intermediate late-time.\nAt a qualitative level we have observed the usual picture in the perturbative dynamics for all fields and geometries considered here. After the initial transient\nregime, it follows the quasinormal mode phase and finally\na power-law tail. In contrast to the 5-dimensional model\nin [31], in the present context we do not observe KaluzaKlein massive modes in the late-time behavior of the perturbations. This is actually expected, since our treatment for gravitational perturbations neglects the backreaction from the bulk. Still, as discussed in section IV,\nour results should model the quasinormal regime.\nA necessary condition for the stability of the geometries we have considered is that these backgrounds must\nbe stable under the perturbations modelled by the effective potentials (43) and (52).\nIf the effective potential (V ) is positive definite, the\ndifferential operator\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n3\n\nCFM\n\nx\u2192\u2213\u221e\n\n= constant ,\n\n6\n0\n\nVgrav\n\nlim \u03a8 e\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n0,3\n\nVsc\n\nThe equations of motion for the scalar and axial gravitational perturbations give us a tool to analyze the dynamics and stability of the black hole solutions in both\nthe CFM and \"zero mass\" black hole backgrounds.

Nevertheless, even when the effective potential is not positive definite, we do not observe\nunbounded solutions.\n\nUsing both high order WKB method and direct numerical integration of the equations of motion a numerical search for quasinormal modes with positive imaginary\npart was performed for scalar and gravitational perturbations.

Typically,\nfor negative enough values of the parameter \u03b3 (with large\n|\u03b3|) a negative peak in the effective potential will show\nup. It is no longer obvious that the scalar and gravitational perturbations will be stable.\nIf the effective potential is not positive definite (and\ncannot be approximated by a positive definite one), the\nWKB semi-analytical formulae will usually not be applicable, but direct integration techniques will. Using the\nlater approach an extensive search for unstable solutions\nwas made. One important result in this work is that even\nfor very high values of \u03b3, the (scalar and gravitational)\nperturbative dynamics is always stable. This is illustrated\nin Figs. 1 and 2, where we show non-positive definite effective potentials and the corresponding (bounded) field\nevolution.\nThe overall picture of the perturbative dynamics for\nthe effective potentials hereby considered is the usual\none. After a brief transient regime, the quasinormal\nmode dominated phase follows, and, finally, at late times\na power-law tail dominates.\nFor the fundamental multipole mode (l = 0) the effective potential will not be positive definite for any value\nof the parameter \u03b3. Direct integration shows that the\nfield evolution is always bounded for a great range of\nvariation of \u03b3. This point is illustrated in Figs. 1 and\n2, where we have selected rather large values of \u03b3. Indeed, it is observed that the decay is dominated from very\nearly time by the power-law tail. Therefore, it is very\ndifficult to estimate the quasinormal frequencies directly\nfrom this \"time\u2013dependent\" approach. The WKB-type\nexpressions are not applicable if l = 0 for two reasons:\nthe effective potentials are not positive for r larger than\na certain value, and it is well known that this method\nworks better with l < n, where n is the overtone number.\nWith small but non-zero values of l the quasinormal\nfrequencies can be accurately estimated. As it is shown in\n\ns\n\n2l\n3M 2\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n.\nn+\n2\n\n(62)\n\nAs it can be seen from the data in tables I and II\nand Fig. 3, the dependence of the frequencies with the\nparameter \u03b3 is very weak, although not trivial. In a\nlarge variation range of \u03b3 the absolute value of Im(\u03c90 ) is\na monotonically decreasing function, while Re(\u03c90 ) typically has maximum points.\nThe late-time behavior of the perturbations considered\nhere can be treated analytically. Far from the black hole\nthe scalar effective potential in terms of r\u22c6 assumes the\nform,\n(\n2M\nwith l = 0\nr\u22c63\nCF M\n(r\u22c6 ) \u223c l(l+1)\nVsc\n4Ml(l+1) ln(r\u22c6 /2M)\n+\nwith l > 0 .\nr\u22c62\nr\u22c63\n(63)\nIt is then shown [32, 33] that with the initial data having\ncompact support a potential with this form has a latetime tail\nRlCF M \u223c t\u2212(2l+3) .\n\n(64)\n\nTherefore, at asymptotically late times the perturbation\ndecays as a power-law tail for any value of the parameter\n\u03b3. This is a strong indication that the models are indeed\nstable. This point is illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. It is\nreminiscent from a similar behavior of the Gauss Bonnet term added to Einstein gravity in higher dimensions,\nwhich was recently treated in [34]. Although the result\nis formally valid also for the gravitational perturbations\nwe have considered, it should be noted that in the simplified model developed in this paper the back-reaction\nfrom the bulk, which can modify the tail presented here,\nwas neglected.\n\nC.\n\n\"Zero mass\" brane black holes\n\nThe treatment in section IV is general enough to include also the case of perturbations around the \"zero\nmass\" brane black hole.

Nevertheless, the numerical integration is possible. The semi-analytical WKB\napproach was also used to compute quasinormal frequencies. The concordance is excellent.

The parameter h is set to h = 1. (Right) Dependence\nof the angular frequency \u03c9l in Eq.(74) with l for several values\nof h.\n\nTherefore, for l > 0 the power index (\u22123/2) is independent of the multipole index l. The angular frequency\n\u03c9l for large times approaches a constant, as we can see\nin Fig. 8 (left). The angular frequency is well approximated by a linear function of l, as indicated in Table V for\nsome values of h. This result implies that the dominating\ncontributions in the late-time decay are the modes with\nl > 0, i.e., the power-law enveloped oscillatory terms.\nWe also observe that these tails dominate from very early\ntimes, so that it was not possible to estimate the quasinormal frequencies in the extreme case (as indicated in\nthe first lines of Tables III and IV).\n\nIn this work we studied brane black holes from the\npoint of view of a brane observer. We considered the\ntwo family solutions found by Bronnikov et al. [9] in\norder to derive the Bekenstein entropy bound and the\none-loop correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula\nusing the 't Hooft brickwall method. In addition, we\nperformed scalar and axial gravitational perturbations\nin two specific examples of these families. With these\nperturbations we were able to analyze the dynamics and\nstability of the black hole solutions.\nThe results of the black hole thermodynamics study\nshow that the entropy bound continues to be independent\nof the black hole parameters. Thus, the presence of the\nbulk does not affect the universality of the entropy bound\nfor a brane observer, as ourselves, reinforcing the Generalized Second Law. Moreover, applying the 't Hooft's\nbrickwall method to both black hole families we see that\nthe entropy correction takes the same form as that of\na Schwarzschild black hole when written in terms of its\nown black hole parameters. Therefore, as the correction\nis linearly dependent on the area, it can be absorbed in\na renormalized gravitational constant.\nOne of the most important results in this paper came\nfrom the perturbative dynamics. We should stress that\nthe assumption \u03b4E\u03b1\u03b2 = 0 was necessary in order to solve\nthe gravitational perturbation equation (44) without any\nknowledge of the bulk structure. This vanishing tidal effect is perfectly justified when the perturbation energy\nis lower than the threshold of the Kaluza-Klein massive\nmodes. Likewise, as we neglect the bulk back-reaction,\nour analysis does not describe the perturbation late-time\nbehavior. Our results show no unstable mode in the\nscalar and gravitational analysis. In addition, the latetime tails display a power-law behavior what enforces\ntheir stability.\nIn the case of CFM black hole even if the effective\npotential is not positive\u2013definite the quasinormal modes\nare stable (negative imaginary part). The agreement of\nthe several methods employed in the calculation is good\nfor l not too small.\nOn the other hand, in the case of the \"zero mass\" black\nhole we observe a richer picture. The scalar and gravitational field evolution is always bounded suggesting that\nthis class of models is stable. But the late time decay\nof the matter field strongly depends on the parameters\nC and h. If C is non-zero and not equal to h, the latetime decay is dominated by a power-law tail with the\nusual dependence on the multipole parameter l. But if\nC = h, this dependence changes. Finally, in the extreme\nregime (C = 0) the late-time decay is dominated by oscillatory modes with a power-law envelope. This power\nindex seems to be universal, not depending on l.\nSummarizing, the thermodynamics in the class\nof models we considered is consistent, while\nthe dynamics in specific backgrounds is stable\nin the approach employed in the present work.\n\n\f12\nTable IV: Fundamental quasinormal frequencies for the axial gravitational perturbation around the \"zero mass\" black hole for\nseveral values of the C and l.
