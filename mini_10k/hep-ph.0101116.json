Given the general characteristics of the field profiles known to\nlead to the best event rate predictions, several specific choices of profiles are assumed\nand fits to the rates, to the electron recoil spectrum in SuperKamiokande and to the\ncombined rates and spectrum are performed. Both the rate and spectrum fits are\nremarkably better than in a previous analysis of the magnetic moment solution which\nused a former standard solar model and previous data, and in particular, rate fits are\nfar better than those from oscillations. The global analysis also reflects the general\nvery good quality of the fits.\n\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: pulido@beta.ist.utl.pt\n\n\fWhereas the apparent anticorrelation of the neutrino event rate with sunspot activity\nclaimed long ago by the Homestake collaboration [1] remained unconfirmed by other experiments [2], [3], [4] and theoretical analyses [5], the magnetic moment solution to the solar\nneutrino problem is at present an important possibility to be explored in the quest for an\nexplanation of the solar neutrino deficit. This is the idea, originally proposed by Cisneros\n[6], and later revived by Voloshin, Vysotsky and Okun [7], that a large magnetic moment\nof the neutrino may interact with the magnetic field of the sun, converting weakly active to\nsterile neutrinos. It now appears in fact that this deficit is energy dependent, in the sense\nthat neutrinos of different energies are suppressed differently. In order to provide an energy\ndependent deficit, the conversion mechanism from active to nonactive neutrinos must be\nresonant, with the location of the critical density being determined by the neutrino energy.\nThus was developed the idea of the resonant spin flavour precession (RSFP) proposed in\n1988 [8]. It involves the simultaneous flip of both chirality and flavour consisting basically\nin the assumption that the neutrino conversion due to magnetic moment and magnetic field\ntakes place through a resonance inside matter in much the same way as matter oscillations\n[9]. A sunspot activity related event rate in a particular experiment would hence imply that\nmost of the neutrinos with energies relevant to that experiment have their resonances in the\nsunspot range. However, the depth of sunspots is unknown (they may not extend deeper\nthan a few hundred kilometers) and the observed field intensity is too small in sunspots to\nallow for a significant conversion. The anticorrelation argument has therefore lost its appeal\nfor several years now.\nDespite the absence of the anticorrelation argument, several main reasons may be invoked to motivate RSFP and investigating its consequences for solar neutrinos. In fact both\nRSFP and all oscillation scenarios indicate a drop in the survival probability from the low\nenergy (pp) to the intermediate energy neutrino sector (7 Be, CNO, pep) and a subsequent\nmoderate rise as the energy increases further into the 8 B sector. The magnetic field profiles\nproviding good fits to the event rates from solar neutrino experiments typically show the\ncharacteristic of a sharp rise in intensity at some point in the solar interior, followed by a\nprogressive moderate decrease [10], [11]. This is in opposite correspondence with the energy\ndependence of the probability in the sense that the strongest field intensities correspond to\nthe smallest survival probabilities. Hence RSFP offers a unique explanation for the general\nshape of the probability, which naturally appears as a consequence of the field profile. On\nthe other hand, from solar physics and helioseismology such a sharp rise and peak field\nintensity is expected to occur along the tachoclyne, the region extending from the upper\nradiative zone to the lower convective zone, where the gradient of the angular velocity of\nsolar matter is different from zero [12], [13]. Furthermore, it has become clear [14], [10],\n[11] that RSFP provides event rate fits from the solar neutrino experiments that are far\nbetter than all oscillation ones [15], [16]. Finally, there are recent claims in the literature for\nevidence of a neutrino flux histogram [17] containing two peaks, an indication of variability\npointing towards a nonzero magnetic moment of the neutrino.\nThe aim of this paper is to present a statistical analysis of seven field profiles proposed in\n1\n\n\f[10], all obeying the general features described above, in the light of the updated standard\nsolar model (BP 2000) [18] and the most recent data [1, 2, 3, 4]. For each profile the\nbest fits of both the rate and recoil electron spectrum in neutrino electron scattering are\ndetermined along with the corresponding \u03c72 . Unlike a previous analysis, the contribution\nof hep neutrinos is taken into account in the spectrum fits. The results show a remarkable\nimprovement in the quality of both sets of fits with respect to ref. [10] where the BP'98\nstandard solar model [19] and the available data at the time were used. Throughout the\ncalculations a value of \u03bc\u03bd = 10\u221211 \u03bcB is assumed.\nThe profiles investigated are the following:\nP rof iles (1), (2)\nB = 0 , x < xR\n(1)\nx \u2212 xR\n, xR \u2264 x \u2264 xC\n(2)\nB = B0\nxC \u2212 xR\n\u0015\n\u0014\nx \u2212 xC\n, xC \u2264 x \u2264 1\n(3)\nB = B0 1 \u2212\n1 \u2212 xC\nwhere x is the fraction of the solar radius and units are in Gauss.

The\ncontribution of the hep flux to both the Gallium and Homestake event rates was neglected.\nThe \u03c72 analysis for the ratios of event rates and electron spectrum in SuperKamiokande\nwas done following the standard procedure described in [10] \u2020 .\nThe ratios of event rates to the SSM event rates and the recoil electron spectrum normalized to the SSM one, both denoted by Rth in the following, were calculated in the parameter\nranges \u2206m221 = (4 \u2212 22) \u00d7 10\u22129 eV 2 , B0 = (3 \u2212 30) \u00d7 104 G for all magnetic field profiles and\ninserted in the \u03c72 definitions for the rates and spectrum,\n\u03c72rates =\n\n3\nX\n\nh\n\n2\n(Rjth1 \u2212 Rj1 exp ) \u03c3rates\n(tot)\n\nj1 ,j2 =1\n\ni\u22121\n\nj1 j2\n\n(Rjth2 \u2212 Rj2 exp )\n\n(23)\n\nwith (Ga=1, Cl=2, SK=3)\n\u03c72sp =\n\n18\nX\n\nexp\n2\nth\n(Rjth1 \u2212 Rjexp\n)[\u03c3sp\n(tot)]\u22121\nj1 j2 (Rj2 \u2212 Rj2 ) .\n1\n\n(24)\n\nj1 ,j2 =1\n\nThe quantities Rexp in eqs. (21), (22) are directly read from tables I, II respectively and\nthe total error matrices \u03c3 2 (tot) are derived from the definitions given in [10], using [21] and\nthe error bars in tables I, II. In fitting the rates one has 3 experiments and 2 parameters\n(the mass square difference between neutrino flavours and the value of the field at the peak),\nhence the number of degrees of freedom is one, while for the spectrum there are 18 data\npoints, hence 16 degrees of freedom. For global fits one has\n\u03c72gl =\n\n21\nX\n\nexp\n2\nth\n(Rjth1 \u2212 Rjexp\n)[\u03c3gl\n(tot)]\u22121\nj1 j2 (Rj2 \u2212 Rj2 ) .\n1\n\n(25)\n\nj1 ,j2 =1\n\nHere index values 1, 2, 3 are used for the rates and 4, ..., 21 for the spectrum. The best fits\nfor the rates in terms of \u2206m221 , B0 and the corresponding values of \u03c72 for rates, spectrum\nand global fits are shown in table III. In table IV the spectrum best fits are shown with\n\u2020\n\nHere only the main definitions and differences are registered. For the calculational details we refer the\nreader to ref.[10].\n\n4\n\n\fthe corresponding values of \u03c72spmin and table V shows the global best fits with the values of\n\u03c72rates , \u03c72sp in each profile. In this case the number of d.o.f. is 19 (=21-2).\nIt is seen that the rate fits (table III) are in some cases excellent, with four of the profiles\nbeing much favoured, in particular profile 2. The most unfavoured ones (profiles 4, 5 and 7)\ngive nevertheless substantially smaller \u03c72 as compared to oscillations [15, 16]. It is difficult\nat present to develop a general distinction between the characteristics of those profiles which\nprovide the best fits and the others. In profiles 6 and 7 for instance the field intensity along\nthe bottom of the convective zone rises in the same way and the quality of the rate fits is\nquite different: this suggests that an upward facing concavity (profile 6) along the upper\nconvective zone is preferred relative to a constant slope (profile 7). In fact, since the low\nenergy sector of the 8 B neutrinos is highly suppressed because their resonances are located\nclose to the intermediate energy ones (pep, CNO) whose suppression has to be maximal,\nthe higher energy sector of 8 B has to undergo little suppression in order to ensure a survival\nprobability close to 1/2 as reported by SuperKamiokande. Hence the magnetic field should\ndecrease steeply at first after its maximum and then more smoothly. The same conclusion\nis also suggested from inspection of profiles 4 and 5: while they exhibit a sudden rise at\nthe bottom of the convective zone with infinite slope, their downward slopes have opposite\nshapes to each other, favouring the case with an upward facing concavity (profile 5). As\nfor profile 4 the fits still worsen, as expected, if the exponent 2 in eq. (8) is increased. An\ninfinite rise in field intensity (profiles 4 and 5) is also disfavoured relative to a finite one\n(compare 3 with 4 and 6 with 5). The case of the two triangle profiles (1 and 2) suggests\nthat the upward slope should be higher than the downward one.\nTable III shows unusually large values of \u03c72gl at the rate best fits for profiles 4 and 7. This\nis related to a high instability of \u03c72 both for rates and global fits against small variations of\n\u2206m221 and B0 not shared by other profiles, as can be seen from a comparison with table V.\nThe 90 and 99% CL regions for the rates defined in the \u2206m221 , B0 plane from the condition \u03c72 \u2264 \u03c72min + \u2206\u03c72 with, for one degree of freedom, \u2206\u03c72 = 2.71 and 6.64 respectively,\nare shown in fig.1. The four profiles chosen are those for which \u03c72min < 0.1. As far as the\nspectrum fits are concerned, the results for the minima of \u03c72sp are also remarkably good\n(see table IV). A comparison of tables III and IV and inspection of fig.1 show a discrepancy between the rate and spectrum best fits. To further examine this discrepancy one can\nanalise for each profile the difference between the CL's corresponding to \u03c72sp at the rate and\nspectrum best fits also listed in table IV [22]. For 16 d.o.f. it is seen from the values of this\ndifference that all rate best fits lie within a region of 10.5% CL with respect to the spectrum\nbest fit: the function \u03c72sp has a weak dependence on the parameters B0 and \u2206m221 , so that\nthe mismatch between the rates and spectrum fits is statistically meaningless. Hence one\nshould expect very good global fits. In fact the global best fits, all with a remarkably low\n\u03c72global (see table V) always lie within a similar (11.4% CL) region relative to the spectrum\nones and also very close to the rate best fits, namely within a 41% CL region with respect\nto these, as can be derived from tables III, IV and V and using ref. [22].\n\n5\n\n\fAs an example, the predicted spectrum (eq. (22)) for profile 1 is shown in figs.2 and\n3 respectively at the rate and spectrum best fits superimposed on the SuperKamiokande\ndata. The moderate rise occuring for Ee \u2265 12MeV is the effect of hep neutrinos.\nAs previously referred, a value of \u03bc\u03bd = 10\u221211 \u03bcB was assumed in the calculations. Since\nthe order parameter is the product \u03bcB and the peak value of the field is probably as large as\n3 \u00d7 105 G [12, 13], the best fits imply an effective value of \u03bc\u03bd in the range (2 \u2212 5) \u00d7 10\u221212 \u03bcB\nin consistency with most astrophysical bounds [23].\nTo summarize, the analysis of prospects for the magnetic moment solution to the solar\nneutrino problem made on the basis of BP'2000 solar standard model and using the most\nrecent pre-SNO data reveals extremely good fits for the rates for a class of field profiles with\na steep rise across the bottom of the convective zone and a more moderate decrease up to\nthe surface. There is a substantial and noteworthy improvement in the quality of the fits\nwith respect to a previous analysis using BP'98 [19] and previous data. Spectrum fits are\nalso quite good and consistent with the rate fits.\nIn the present analysis only time averaged data were considered and a fitting was made\nto a time constant profile 'buried' in the solar interior. If, on the contrary, the active\nneutrino flux turns out to be time dependent, a situation most likely to be interpreted\nthrough the magnetic moment solution with a time dependent interior field, the present\napproach is obviously inadequate and all fittings thus made will in some way be flawed.\nAveraging the event rates over time implies disregarding possible information in the data\nwhich otherwise is available if different periods of time are considered [17]. The robustness\nof such a procedure will greatly improve with the accumulation of more data.\n\nReferences\n[1] Homestake Collaboration: B. T. Cleveland et al., Astrophys. J. 496, 505 (1998); B.\nT.
