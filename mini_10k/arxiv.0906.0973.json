They reflect the flood of new and important\nresults in the fields of cosmic ray astrophysics, high energy gamma ray astronomy, high\nenergy neutrino astronomy and the search for astrophysical evidence of physics beyond the\nstandard models of particle physics, general relativity and cosmology. Unable to cover in a\nshort summary all the talks and the new results, I will limit my summary and comments to\nresults which were presented and discussed in this Rencontre and which to the best of my\njudgment are the most important and fundamental ones.\n\n2.\n\nUltra-high Energy Cosmic Rays\n\nIf the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed reaching Earth are extragalactic in origin, as suggested by the isotropy of their arrival directions and the lack of\ncorrelation with the Galactic plane, than inelastic collisions with the cosmic background\nradiation (CBR) and cosmic expansion are expected to degrade their energies during their\ntravel from their extragalactic sources to Earth. If the UHECRs are protons, pion production\nin collisions with the cosmic microwave background radiation (MBR) strongly degrades their\nenergy above an effective threshold of \u223c 5 \u00d7 1019 eV, the so called Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin\n(GZK) threshold (1),(2) while e+ e\u2212 pair production in collisions with the CBR degrades\ntheir energy above an effective threshold of \u223c 1018 eV just below the CR ankle at \u223c 3 \u00d7 1018\neV. If the UHECRs are nuclei, nuclear photodissociation in collisions with the CBR begins\n1\n\narnon@physics.technion.ac.il\nPhysics Department, Technion, Haifa 32000, Israel\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nto be effective at a slightly lower energy for light nuclei and around the GZK threshold\nenergy for iron-like nuclei (3). Thus, the suppression of the flux of CR protons above the\nGZK threshold is expected to be accompanied by even a stronger suppression of the flux of\nheavier nuclei.\nEarly measurements by the Akeno Giant Air Shower Array (AGASA), which detects\nair showers at ground level with scintillators, reported the detection of UHECRs above the\nGZK threshold not showing the expected GZK suppression (4) but showing strong clustering\nin their arrival direction. These led to variety of interpretations including speculations on\nphysics beyond the standard particle physics model and on violation of Lorentz invariance\nand special relativity. However, later results from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes)\nexperiment (5),(6), which detect the fluorescence emitted in the air by nitrogen molecules\nexcited by the passage of the shower, observed the GZK suppression above the expected\nthreshold and did not find a significant unisotropy in the arrival directions of UHECRs.\nThe AGASA and HiRes results were based on a small number of events and used different\ntechniques. Results from measurements of UHECRs by the Pierre Auger Observatory which\nwas conceived as a hybrid detector combining the two detection methods and covering an area\n30 times bigger than that of AGASA, that were obtained during its construction confirmed\nthe GZK suppression above the expected threshold (7),(8) and appeared to indicate that\nUHECRs above the GZK threshold arrive from nearby active galactic nuclei (9),(10).\nThe fast falling spectrum of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), up to energies\nof about 1020 eV where the CR flux is of the order of 1 particle per km2 per a couple of centuries, their arrival directions and their composition have now been measured by HiRes (6)\nand by the PAO (8),(11),(12) with sizable statistics (roughly twice and four times, respectively, the exposure of AGASA). The main results can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 GZK Suppression Confirmed: Allowing for 10% adjustment in the CR energies\ninferred either by HiRes or PAO from the flourescence light emitted by air molecules\nexcited by the CR induced atmospheric showers, because of a 10% difference in the\nadopted flourescence yield in the showers, the energy spectra of UHECRs measured\nby both experiments are identical (Fig. 1a) and show the expected GZK suppression\nbeyond \u223c 4 \u00d7 1019 eV, consistent with the highest energy CRs being extragalactic\nprotons. (The power law E \u22122.69 which fits the PAO spectrum below 40 EeV predicted\n163\u00b13 events above 40 EeV and 35\u00b11 above 100 EeV, while 69 events and 1 event\nwere observed by PAO, clearly confirming the GZK suppression).\n\u2022 Composition: The atmospheric depth (in g/cm2 ) of shower maximum, Xmax , has\nbeen used both by HiRes (6) and PAO (11),(13) to infer the composition of UHECRs.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nBoth experiments report a mixed composition that is becoming lighter with energy up\nto 3 EeV. However, HiRes results indicate a light composition all the way up to the\nGZK threshold around 40 EeV where it runs out of statistics, whereas PAO results\nindicate that the composition becomes heavier above 3 EeV and more so beyond the\nGZK threshold (Fig. 1b). These conclusions are valid provided that hadron physics\ndoes not change above 3 EeV.\n\u2022 Isotropy: Below the GZK threshold both the HiRes and the PAO CR events are\ncompletely consistent with statistical fluctuations of an isotropic distribution of arrival\ndirections.\n\u2022 UHECRs-AGN correlation: At energies above the GZK threshold only CRs from\nnearby sources can reach Earth. If they are not deflected much by the intergalactic and Galactic magnetic fields, their arrival directions should point back to their\nsources, opening the window to UHECR astronomy. The evolution with energy of the\ndistribution of arrival directions of UHECRs measured by PAO shows a sharp transition from isotropy to anisotropy beyond the GZK threshold. The arrival directions of\nUHECRs with energy above 57 EeV show a correlation on angular scales of less than\n6o with the sky positions of AGNs within 71 Mpc, which are concentrated near the\nsupergalactic plane. Intrinsic (catalog independent) properties of these events, such\nas their auto-correlation function, show a clear departure from isotropy in a large angular range (12). The correlation/unisotropy observed by PAO was not confirmed by\nHiRes which reported (6) lack of arrival-direction correlation of their highest energy\nevents with local AGNs (in the Northern Hemisphere). PAO found that out of their\n27 UHECRs events with energy above 56 EeV, 20 were found to lie within 3.2o of the\nline of sight to an AGN nearer than 71 Mpc (Fig. 2a) while only 6 were expected to be\nfound by chance from an isotropic distribution of arrival directions (the threshold energy, maximal angular deviation, and maximal AGN distance were chosen to maximize\nthe UHECRs-correlation). HiReS found that using the PAO criteria only 2 of their 13\nevents above 56 EeV correlated with AGN (Fig. 2b), while 3.2 were expected randomly,\nruling out the correlation at a probability of 83%. The PAO collaboration has stressed\nthat even though the correlation with nearby AGN seems to be quite robust in their\nsample, the angular scale of \u223c 6o does not make possible to unambiguously identify the\nsources and sources which are distributed similar to AGNs cannot be excluded as the\ntrue sources.\n\u2022 UHEGRs: Showers initiated by ultra-high energy gamma rays (UHEGRs) develop\ndifferently from showers induced by nuclear primaries. Particularly, the depth of shower\nmaximum is much larger and the shower is much poorer in muons relative to those\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nof CR nuclei. Upper limits on the presence of photons in the primary cosmic-ray flux\nwere obtained by PAO; in particular a limit of 2% (at 95% c.l.) above 10 EeV on the\nflux of UHEGRs relative to UHECRs was derived by PAO (13). This limit improves\nprevious constraints on Lorentz violation parameters by several orders of magnitude\ndue to the extreme energy in case of UHEGRs.\nAlthough AGN are a natural source of extragalactic UHECRs, the directional correlation\nfound by Auger is surprising in many respects. A 3.2o deviation is of the order of magnitude\nof that inflicted on UHECRs by the magnetic field of the Galaxy, it would be surprising\nif extragalactic CRs did not encounter intergalactic magnetic fields with similar or larger\neffects. The Veron catalog of AGN is not complete and not directionally uniform in its\ncoverage and sensitivity, unlike the Auger coverage within its field of view. The Auger\ncorrelation is purely directional, not investigated case-by-case for the possible effects of AGN\ndistance, luminosity, jet direction and radio loudness. The effect of distance is obvious, the\ncorrelation with luminosity is very plausible. Concerning jet-direction, one has to understand\nhow the UHECRs from AGNs could be fairly isotropically emitted, given that AGNs produce\nextremely collimated jets, and that they are seen in gamma-rays as very luminous blazars\nonly when the jets are pointing in our direction. The proton- and electron-acceleration\nefficiencies of CR sources are presumably correlated. The radio loudness is a measure of the\nnumber of high energy synchrotron-radiating electrons. The jets of an AGN may accelerate\nCRs to well above the GZK limit and collimate them forward in a cone of aperture 1/\u0393\nwhere \u0393 is their bulk motion Lorentz factor. But the PAO results suggest a more isotropic\nsource, the end lobe of an AGN jet being the obvious choice (14). These lobes have radii\nRl of a few kpc. They are steadily energized by the incoming jet. Traveling in a medium\nswept up by previous jet components, a jet may deposit in its lobe an energy in excess of\n1060 erg, emitted by the central black hole during the AGNs active life. An equipartition\nmagnetic field B in these end lobes can exceed a milli Gauss. The Larmor limit energy for\nthe acceleration of a proton in a lobe is then Emax \u2248 e B RL \u2248 3 \u00d7 1021 eV, well above the\nGZK threshold.\nHowever, the PAO UHECRs-AGN correlation is puzzling in other respects. E.g., why\nthere are no events from the direction of the Virgo cluster, that contains powerful AGN such\nas M87 at 14 Mpc? Why the maximal correlation for UHECRs with E\u2265 57 EeV is with AGN\nat distance less than 71 Mpc - Such UHECRs should come from distances up to 200 Mpc\nand not only from less than 71 Mpc.\nAll together, the results from PAO are very important in many respects and are pointing\ntowards a potential breakthrough in UHECR and UHEGR astronomies, but much more\nstatistics are needed in order to establish that. With a main goal of full sky coverage, the\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nAuger Observatory is to be completed by a northern site. Current plans aim at a significantly\n\u223c 7 times larger array to proceed with UHECR and UHEGR astronomies.\nTo reach even larger exposures, dedicated observatories in space which can observe\nUHECR induced atmospheric showers by looking down towards the Earth are planned. The\nExtreme Universe Space Observatory (EUSO) on the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM),\nwhich will detect fluorescence from UHECR events within 60o field of view, is being planned\nfor deployment on the International Space Station. JEM-EUSO may detect \u223c 1, 000 particles\nabove 70 EeV in a three year mission. The Orbiting Wide-Angle Light Collectors (OWL) will\nstereoscopically image fluorescence from UHECRs. Such missions may observe a significant\nfraction of the \u223c 10 million showers generated in the Earth atmosphere per year by UHECRs\nwith energy above the GZK threshold.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nDark Matter\n\nEvidence from cosmic colliders\n\nDark matter is an hypothetical matter that does not emit electromagnetic radiation,\nwhose presence has been inferred consistently from gravitational effects on visible matter,\non light trajectories, on the space-time geometry of the universe, on structure formation in\nthe universe and on cosmic evolution.\nThe observed phenomena which imply that the universe contains much more dark matter\nthan visible matter, include the rotational speeds of galaxies, orbital velocities of galaxies\nin clusters, gravitational lensing of background objects by galaxies and galaxy clusters and\nthe temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter\nalso plays a central role in structure formation and galaxy evolution, and has measurable\neffects on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation. At present, the\ndensity of ordinary baryons and radiation in the universe is estimated about 4% of the total\nenergy density in the universe. About 22% is thought to be composed of dark matter. The\nremaining 74% is thought to consist of dark energy, distributed diffusely in space.\nThe dark matter hypothesis has generally been the preferred solution to the missing\nmass problems in astronomy and cosmology over alternative theories of gravity based on\nmodifications to general relativity which have been used to model dark matter observations\nwithout invoking dark matter (15),(16). However, until recently there was no conclusive\nevidence that dark matter really exists. This has changed dramatically by X-ray and optical\nobservations of collisions between galaxy clusters (17),(18),(19), such as in 1E0657-558 at\nz=0.296 (the 'Bullet Cluster'), MACS J0025 at z=0.586 and A520 at z=0.201 (the 'Cosmic\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nTrain Wreck'). In such collisions the clusters' galaxies and dark matter halos are affected\nonly by gravity while the electromagnetic interactions between the clusters' X-ray emitting\nionized gas produce an additional drag on the gas. Consequently, after the collision the\ngalaxies and their associated dark matter halos lead the slower moving X-ray emitting gas\nclouds stripped off from the galaxy clusters, as seen in Figs. 3a,3b. The galaxies in these\nFigures were observed from the ground with Magellan and from space with the HST, the\nstripped off X-ray emitting gas was mapped with Chandra and the dark matter halos of\nthe clusters were mapped by measuring the distortion of the images of background galaxies\nby the deflection of light as it passes the clusters dark matter halos. Such observations\nrequire that regardless of the form of the gravitational force law at large distances and low\naccelerations, the majority of the mass of the system be some form of dark matter. Many\nmore cases of cluster collisions will be studied through gravitational lensing of background\ngalaxies with a dedicated large telescope such as the 8.4m Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\n(LSSS) which is under design and development and scheduled to be commissioned at Cerro\nPachn (Chile) by 2017 (17).\n\n3.2.\n\nDirect and indirect detections ?\n\nDetermining the nature of the dark matter particles is one of the most important problems in modern cosmology and particle physics. Both direct detection in which the interaction of dark matter particles are observed in a detector and indirect detection that looks for\nthe products of dark matter annihilation or decay products have been conducted extensively\nand are ongoing. Dark matter detection experiments have ruled out some WIMP (Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particle) and axion models. There are also several claims of direct detection of dark matter particles in lab experiments such as DAMA/NaI (Dark Matter/Sodium\nIodine) in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory, and possible detections of astrophysical\ngamma rays, positrons and electrons from dark matter annihilation, by EGRET aboard the\nCGRO, by ATIC and by PAMELA, respectively, but all these are so far unconfirmed and\ndifficult to reconcile with the negative results of other experiments. In particular:\n\n3.2.1. The EGRET GeV excess:\nThe spectrum of the diffuse \u03b3 background radiation (GBR) that was measured by\nEGRET aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory showed an excess above 1 GeV\nin comparison with the flux expected from interactions of cosmic ray (CR) nuclei and electrons in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) (20). The origin of this GeV excess has been\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nunknown. Among its suggested origins was annihilation or decay of WIMPs (21). However,\nrecent measurements with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the Fermi observatory\nhave yielded preliminary results (22) which do not show a GeV excess at small Galactic latitudes and agree with the flux expected from CR interactions in the Galactic ISM (Fig. 4a).\nAlso, the extragalactic GBR measured by EGRET does not show a correponding 'GeV\nexcess' (Fig. 4b). which would be expected from such dark matter annihilation/decay in external galaxies and in the IGM. Moreover, by comparing the spectra of gamma-rays around\none GeV from nearby Galactic pulsars, which were measured by EGRET and LAT, the\nFermi collaboration confirmed (22) previous conclusions (23) that the origin of the EGRET\nGeV excess is probably instrumental and not a dark matter annihilation/decay signal.\n\n3.2.2. The ATIC excess:\nThe Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter (ATIC) experiment aboard balloon flights\nover Antarctica (24) reported an excess in the flux of CR electrons at energies between 300800 GeV. Several papers suggested that this excess in cosmic ray electrons (and positrons)\narises from annihilation of dark matter particles such as Kaluza-Klein particles with a mass of\nabout 620 GeV/c2 (25)). However, in this meeting caution was advocated when interpreting\ncosmic ray electron and positron data above a few GeV because of possible proton contamination of the measurements and it was pointed out that the ATIC reported data should\nbe suspected as the authors did not properly take into account the uncertainties associated\nwith a potential hadronic background due to particle interactions inside the graphite target\non top of the detector (26).\nMoreover, it was pointed out (27) that if the ATIC electron excess was due to dark\nmatter annihilation, such an excess of Galactic cosmic ray electrons would have produced\na detectable GeV excess in the diffuse Galactic GBR at large latitudes, while dark matter\nannihilation in external galaxies would have produced a detectable GeV excess in the diffuse\nextragalactic GBR at all latitudes, which was not observed by EGRET (Figs. 5a,b).\nAfter the Rencontre de Moriond it was shown that the ATIC excess is probably instrumental due to misidentified proton induced electron-like events in the\nATIC detector by cosmic ray protons (29). Moreover, the HESS collaboration\nreported a measurement of the cosmic-ray electron spectrum above 340 GeV\nwhich does not show the ATIC peak (30) and the LAT collaboration reported\na high precision measurement of the steeply falling cosmic ray electron spectrum between 20 GeV and 1 TeV which also does not show the prominent ATIC\npeak (31). The spectral index of the CR electrons (plus positrons) with energy\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nbelow 1 TeV which was measured by HESS and by PAMELA is consistent with\n-3.2. This index is suggested by the spectral index 2.1\u00b10.03 of both the Galactic\nGBR at large latitudes and the extragalactic GBR (at all latitudes), which were\nmeasured by EGRET. However a significantly different spectral index \u22123.04 was\nmeasured by LAT. Additional measurements by LAT and by other experiments\nin space such as PAMELA, and in particular experiments with magnetic spectrometers such as AMS in space and on high altitude balloon experiments above\nthe south pole, are highly desirable.\n\n3.2.3. The PAMELA positron fraction:\nIn the standard leaky box models, CR sources accelerate primary cosmic ray nuclei\nand electrons while secondary electrons and positrons are produced by the decay of charged\n\u03c0's and K's produced in hadronic collisions of primary cosmic ray nuclei in the interstellar\nmedium (ISM). The primary particles are injected with roughly the same energy spectrum\ndn/dE \u223c E\u2212pinj with pinj \u2248 2.2, but the escape by diffusion from the Galaxy increases the\nspectral index of the primary CR nuclei to pN \u2248 2.7 while cooling by synchrotron radiation\nand inverse Compton scattering of background photons increases the spectral index of the\nprimary CR electrons by one unit to pe \u2248 3.2. Because of Feynman scaling the secondary\nelectrons and positrons, which are produced by CR interactions in the ISM, have a spectral\nindex pinj \u2248 2.7, which increases to pe \u223c 3.7 by cooling. Consequently, in the standard CR\nmodel the positron fraction decreases like \u223c E\u22120.5 at high energies (where solar modulation\nand geomagnetic effects are negligible). Contrary to this expectation the PAMELA satellite\nexperiment has recently reported (32),(33),(34), a dramatic rise in the positron fraction\nstarting at 10 GeV and extending up to 100 GeV in complete disagreement with the standard\ncosmic ray model calculations (35). These observations have created much excitement and\nmotivated many papers claiming that the observed rise is produced by the annihilation of\ndark matter particles. Other publications related the excess to a local enhancement of the\nflux of electrons and positrons due to nearby galactic sources of positrons and electrons such\nas pulsars (36) or to secondary production in the ISM by CRs from nearby sources such as\nsupernova remnants in the nearest spiral arm (37).\nHowever, the rise of the positron fraction with increasing energy beyond 10 GeV may be\nentirely due to hadronic production of positrons (and electrons) in the cosmic ray sources (27):\nIn fact, if Fermi acceleration of highly relativistic particles results in a universal power-law\ndistribution of Lorentz factors of the accelerated particles, dn/d\u03b3 \u221d \u03b3 \u2212pinj , with an injection\nspectral index pinj \u2248 2.2, than the injected flux of high energy electrons is suppressed by\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\na factor (me /mp )pinj \u22121 \u2248 10\u22124 compared to that of protons at the same energy (38), which\nis much smaller than their observed ratio in the Galaxy. Cosmic ray nuclei, however, may\nencounter in/near source a total column density comparable to a mean free path for hadronic\ninteractions during their acceleration and before being injected into the ISM. In that case,\ndue to Feynman scaling, they generate an electron+positron spectrum identical to that of\nthe CR protons but with a normalization which is larger by roughly two orders of magnitude\nthan that of the primary Fermi accelerated electrons. The combination of Fermi acceleration\nof electrons and hadronic production of electrons and positrons in/near the CR sources plus\nhadronic production of electrons and positrons in the ISM can naturally explain the rise of\nthe positron fraction beyond 10 GeV (27).\nFinally, despite of the above, caution must be applied also to the PAMELA results as\nemphasized in this Rencontre by M. Schubnell (26): The intensity of cosmic-ray protons\nat 10 GeV exceeds that of positrons by a factor of about 5 \u00d7 104 . Therefore a proton\nrejection of about 106 is required if one wants to obtain a positron sample with less than 5%.\nFurthermore, because the proton spectrum is much harder than the electron and positron\nspectra, the proton rejection has to improve with energy. In addition, any small amount of\nspillover from tails in lower energy bins can become problematic (26). Fig. 6a demonstrates\nthat a proton contamination of 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 can explain the PAMELA positron fraction.\n\n3.2.4. The PAMELA antiproton to proton ratio:\nThe recent measurements of the antiproton to proton ratio measured by PAMELA (32),(33)\nagrees with that expected from secondary production in the ISM, but the measurements do\nnot extend to high enough energy (see Fig. 6b) where the energy dependence can distinguish\nbetween secondary production in the CR sources which yields a constant ratio and secondary\nproduction in the ISM that yields a ratio which decreases like E \u22120.5 .\n\n4.\n\nHigh Energy Gamma Ray Astronomy\n\nThe tremendous progress made in high energy gamma ray astronomy during the past\ntwo decades is due to many instruments with increasing sensitivity covering now the entire\nMeV-PeV energy range, as summarized in Fig. 7 borrowed from Aldo Morselli.\nThis progress has culminated with the successful completion and operation of the large\nimaging Cherenkov telescope systems, HESS, MAGIC and VERITAS and the launch of the\nFermi Gamma-ray Space Observatory on June 11, 2008 with its two main instruments, the\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) for all-sky survey studies of astrophysical and cosmological\npoint and diffuse sources of high energy (30 < E < 300 GeV) and Gamma-ray Burst Monitor\n(GBM) to study gamma-ray bursts. These studies led to an explosion of newly discovered\nGalactic and extragalactic sources.\nMost of the 125 bright non-pulsar gamma ray sources detected by LAT at high latitude (b > 10O in the first 3 months of operation are AGNs (57 FSRQ, 42 BLLac, 6 of\nuncertain class and 2 radio galaxies) (39). The Galactic gamma ray sources include 13 new\npulsars (40) (radio-quiet pulsars, young radio pulsars and millisecond pulsars), pulsar wind\nnebulae (41)(PWNe), supernova remnants, molecular clouds, X-ray binaries (42), Wolf-Rayet\nstars, OB associations, open clusters and globular clusters (43).\n\n4.1.\n\nHigh energy gamma ray astronomy and the origin of Galactic CRs\n\nIn 1934, Baade and Zwicky proposed that supernovae are the main sources of galactic\nCRs which were first discovered by Hess in 1912. Today diffusive shock acceleration in the\nblast wave driven into the ISM by a supernova shell is the most popular model for the\norigin of galactic cosmic rays. Despite the general consensus and exciting recent results,\nthe origin of these particles is still debated and an unambiguous and conclusive proof of\nthe supernova remnant hypothesis is still missing. In particular, the recent detection of a\nnumber of supernova remnants in TeV gamma rays by HESS, MAGIC and VERITAS still\ndoes not constitute a conclusive proof that galactic cosmic rays nuclei with energies below\nthe cosmic ray knee are accelerated mainly in supernova remnants (SNRs). In particular, it\nwas found that it is difficult to disentangle the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the\nobserved gamma ray emission (for an excellent review see (44)).\nIn some shell SNRs such as RX J1713.7-3946 and Vela Junior the non-thermal synchrotron emission exhibits a striking morphological similarity with the TeV gamma ray\nimage. Such a correlation is naturally expected in leptonic models, where both X-rays\nand gamma rays are emitted by the same population of electrons via synchrotron and inverse Compton scattering, respectively. Although the correlation can be accommodated also\nwithin hadronic models if most of the gamma ray emission is through \u03c0 0 decay and the X-ray\nemission is the result of synchrotron emission from secondary electrons from \u03c0 \u00b1 decay. In\nsuch a scenario the energy flux in TeV gamma rays must exceed that in X-rays since the\nelectrons from \u03c0 \u00b1 \u2192 \u03bc\u00b1 \u2192 e\u00b1 decay carry less energy than the \u03b3's from \u03c0 0 decay, while\nthe opposite is observed in RX J1713.7-3946. But, the assumed synchrotron radiation from\nsecondary electrons plus positrons may not be the correct origin of the X-ray emission from\nRX J1713-394 (e.g. bremsstrahlung from ISM protons which enter the SN shell rest-frame\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nwith \u223c 200 keV kinetic energy). In fact, the gamma ray spectrum that was measured from\nthis SNR by HESS up to almost 100 TeV has a knee (or an exponential cutoff) around\nE \u223c 5 Tev which suggest that protons are accelerated in RX J1713.7-3946 up to the CR knee\nenergy around 2 PeV: At 2 PeV the mean charge multiplicity (mostly pions) in pp collisions\nis around 50 and that of the \u03c0 0 's is about 25. Pions carry about 35% of the incident proton\nenergy and about 1/3 of that energy is carried by \u03c0 0 's. Consequently, the typical energy of\nphotons from the decay of \u03c0 0 produced by 2 PeV protons in pp collisions is roughly 5 TeV.\nHowever, the safest way of proving or rejecting acceleration of CR nuclei in RX J1713.73946 (and in SNRs in general) is to search for neutrinos produced in the decay of charged\npions (by stacking all the neutrino events from the direction of known SNRs).\n\n4.2.\n\nHigh energy gamma ray emission in GRBs\n\nDuring nearly 20 years of observations the Burst And Transient Source Experiment\n(BATSE) on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), has detected and measured light curves and spectra in the keV-MeV range of several thousands Gamma Ray\nBursts (GRBs). Higher-energy observations with its EGRET instrument aboard CGRO\nwere limited to those GRBs which happened to be in its narrower field of view. Its large\ncalorimeter measured the light-curves and spectra of several GRBs in the 1-200 MeV energy\nrange. Seven GRBs were detected also with the EGRET spark chamber, sensitive in the energy range 30 MeV - 10 GeV. The EGRET detections indicated that the spectrum of bright\nGRBs extends at least out to 1 GeV, with no evidence for a spectral cut-off (see, e.g., Dingus\n2001, and references therein). However, a few GRBs, such as 940217 (45) and 941017 (46)\nshowed evidence for a high energy component in the GRB pulses which begins significantly\nafter the beginning of the keV- MeV pulse and has a slower temporal decay than that of\nthe keV-MeV emission, suggesting that the high-energy emission, at least in some cases,\nis not a simple extension of the main component, but originates from a different emission\nmechanism and/or region. This has been confirmed recently by observations of high energy\nphotons from several GRBs with the Fermi LAT (49),(50),(51), and AGILE (48). However,\nthe flux levels of TeV gamma rays from a couple of GRBs which were inferred from ground\nlevel measurements of atmospheric showers were not confirmed by HESS with its high sensitivity array which produced upper limits much smaller than the flux levels predicted by\nstandard fireball models where TeV photons are produced by inverse Compton scattering,\ndecay of \u03c0 0 's from proton-gamma collisions and synchrotron radiation from UHE protons.\nNot only the observed flux levels but also the spectral and temporal behaviour of the\nhigh energy emission are not those predicted by the popular fireball (FB) models of GRBs.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nThis is not completely surprising in view of the fact that the rich and accurate data, which\nhave been accumulated in recent years from space-based observations with Swift and ground\nbased observations with robotic telescopes, have already challenged the prevailing popular\nviews on GRBs: Synchrotron radiation (SR) cannot explain simultaneously their prompt\noptical emission and their hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission which were well measured\nin some bright GRBs such as 990123 and 080319B (Figs. 8,??). The prompt hard X-ray\nand gamma-ray pulses cannot be explained by synchrotron radiation from internal shocks\ngenerated by collisions between conical shells. Neither can SR explain their typical energy,\nspectrum, spectral evolution, pulse-shape, rapid spectral softening during their fast decay\nphase and the established correlations between various observables. Moreover, contrary to\nthe predictions of the FB model, the broadband afterglows of GRBs are highly chromatic at\nearly times, the brightest GRBs do not show jet breaks, and in canonical GRBs where breaks\nare present, they are usually chromatic and do not satisfy the closure relations expected from\nFB model jet breaks. In spite of all the above, the GRB community is not so critical and\nmany authors believe that the GRB data require only some modifications of the standard FB\nmodel in order to accommodate the observations. Other authors simply ignore the failures of\nthe FB model and continue the interpretation of observations with the FB model hypotheses\n(colliding conical shells, internal and external shocks, forward and reverse shocks, continuous\nenergy injection, refreshed shocks) and parametrize the data with freely adopted formulae\n(segmented power laws, exponential-to power-law components) which were never derived\nexplicitly from any underlying physical assumptions.\nIn spite of the above, not all authors are so critical and they believe that the GRB\ndata require only some modifications of the standard FB model in order to accommodate\nthe observations. Many papers, including some presented at this Rencontre seem to ignore\nthe failures of the FB model and continue to interpret the observations with the FB model\nhypotheses and parametrize the data with freely adopted formulae.\nThe situation of the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs is entirely different. In a series of\npublications, which were largely ignored by the rest of the GRB community, it was demonstrated repeatedly that the model correctly predicted the main observed properties of GRBs\nand reproduces successfully the diverse broad-band light-curves of both long GRBs (53) and\nshort hard bursts (SHBs) (54). In fact since the discovery of GRBs in 1967 and the beginning\nof the GRB debate, the majority view on key GRB issues initially was always wrong, while a\nminority view turned out to be the right one, as demonstrated in Table I where the 'correct\nview' is indicated by bold letters.\nIn the CB model, a highly relativistic jet of plasmoids (CBs) from the central engine\nfirst encounters a cavity produced by the wind/ejecta blown by the progenitor star (SN-\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nGRBs) or by a companion star or an accretion disk in abinary system (SHBs) and filled up\nwith quasi isotropic radiation (glory) emitted/scattered by by the wind/mass ejecta prior\nto the GRB. The prompt gamma-ray and X-ray emission is dominated by inverse Compton\nscattering (ICS) of this glory light. A simultaneous broad band synchrotron radiation (SR)\nand inverse Compton scattering of this radiation to much higher energies begin slightly after\nthe CBs have swept in enough electrons and ionized nuclei of the ejecta/wind in front of them,\nisotropized them and Fermi accelerated them and the knocked-on (Bethe-Bloch) electrons\nand nuclei in the CBs to high energy by their turbulent magnetic fields. SR from these\nelectrons dominates the optical radiation, while ICS of these SR photons (SSC) produces\nhigh energy photons with an energy flux density that extends beyond TeV. Production of\n\u03c0 0 's in collisions between the Fermi accelerated nuclei and the ambient matter in the CBs\nand the wind produces a power-law distribution of high energy photons which extends to\nmuch higher energies. The same mechanisms can produce also the observed high energy\nemission from short hard bursts (SHBs). Like for blazars, the observed flux of high energy\nphotons from ordinary GRBs and SHBs is suppressed significantly at TeV energies by pair\nproduction in the IGM, while in the energy range covered by LAT, the absorption of photons\nby the extragalactic background light can be negligible.\n\n5.\n\nHigh energy gamma ray astronomy, UHECRs and the extragalactic\nbackground light\n\nPair production in collisions of high energy photons with extragalactic background light\n(EBL) from the far infrared strongly modifies the flux and spectrum of high energy (0.1100 TeV) photons from distant point and diffuse sources. Measurements of these fluxes\nfrom various bright sources such as AGNs and GRBs as function of redshift can be used to\ntest and constrain theoretical models of star and dust formation, structure formation in the\nearly universe, astrophysical models of HE cosmic sources and photon-photon interaction\nat very high energies. Photodisinegration of UHECR nuclei in their collisions with EBL\nphotons strongly affects their composition(55). TeV gamma rays from blazars have been\nused extensively to test the measurements and theoretical estimates of the EBL (see (56)\nand Fig. 10), the strongest constraints come from the most distant blazar 3C279 at z=0.536,\nwhich has been detected by MAGIC (58) in TeV gamma rays. Detection of a 13 GeV photon\nfrom GRB 080916C with the Fermi LAT at redshift z=4.35 has also been used already to\ntest different EBL models (52).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n5.1.\n\nHE gamma rays from extragalactic sources\n\nDespite the detection of a dozen of extragalactic blazars in TeV by HESS (57), MAGIC (58)\nand VERITAS (59) and ten times more in GeV photons by Fermi LAT (60),(39) and despite\nthe multi wavelength campaigns (e.g. (61) where a few of these extragalactic sources were\nobserved simultaneously in the radio, optical, X-ray, GeV and TeV bands, beside constraining some theoretical models, not much better understanding of how massive black holes\nlaunch their mighty jets has been achieved. This is because of the complexity of the black\nhole engine, the complexity of its environment, the complex time variability of the observed\nemission and the very many adjustable parameters and assumptions in the theoretical models. Roughly, most observations are consistent with a leptonic SSC model where synchrotron\nradiation from a population of Fermi accelerated electrons with a typical peak flux energy\nESR suffers inverse Compton scattering by the same population of electrons. The relativistic\nkinematics and the energy dependence of the Klein-Nishina cross section of ICS produces a\nsecond peak at ESSC \u2248 (me c2 )2 \u03b4 2 /3 ESR (1 + z)2 where \u03b4 is the Doppler factor of the Blazar's\njet.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank all the speakers at the 44th Rencontre De Moriond\non High Energy Phenomena in the Universe, the scientific organizing committee for a most\ninteresting program, and in particular Jean Tran Thanh Van and Kim who step aside after\nhaving initiated and organized the past 44 Rencontres de Moriond in order to promote scientific collaboration, scientific exchange and spread of scientific knowledge beyond borders and\nideological and racial barriers.

Both clusters were formed by a collision of two galaxy clusters. The major components of the clusters are shown in different colors., The galaxies\nwhose stars makes them visible in optical light are shown in orange and white, the ionized gas in the clusters which is visible in X-rays is shown in pink and the putative dark\nmatter, which dominates their gravitational potential and is inferred through gravitational\nlensing of background galaxies, is shown in blue. After the collision, most of the matter in the clusters (in blue) is well separated from most of the normal matter (the gas in\npink) and moves ahead of it. This separation provides direct evidence that most of the\nmatter in the clusters is dark matter which cannot be represented by modified gravity of\nthe cluster gas which contains most of the baryons in clusters.

Below 5 GeV\nsolar modulation affects the particle intensities observed near Earth and may explain the\ndiscrepancy between the PAMELA data and older measurements, obtained at distinctively\ndifferent solar epochs. In the region between 5 and 50 GeV measurements by PAMELA\nare consistent with previous data from the HEAT experiment. Bottom (b): Comparison\nbetween the antiproton to proton ratio in Galactic cosmic rays as function of energy as\nmeasured by PAMELA and by previous experiments.

The sub-pulse superimposed on the\ndecaying tail of the three major pulses may be due to the crossing of the 3 leading CBs\nthrough two successive wind layers (2 separate pre-supernova mass ejections by the progenitor star) rather than by 3 additional CBs.
