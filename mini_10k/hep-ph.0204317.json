As the experimental data accumulating in the SuperKamiokande collaboration [2, 3] and more results published by SNO[4], K2K[5] and\nCHOOZ[6] experiments, the parameter space for the neutrino masses and mixing is narrowing down considerably. The recent analyses show that the atmospheric neutrino oscillation\nfavors the \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 process with a nearly maximal mixing angle sin2 2\u03b8atm \u2265 0.87 and the\n\nmass squared difference 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV 2 \u2264 \u2206m2atm \u2264 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV 2 at the 99% confidence\n\nlevel[7]. Among the four solutions for the solar neutrino deficits, the large mixing angle\nMSW (LMA) solution is most favored, followed by the LOW and VAC solutions[8]. The\nsmall mixing angle (SMA) solution is ruled out at the 2\u03c3 level[3, 8]. The parameter space for\nthe LMA solution is 0.2 \u2264 tan2 \u03b8sol \u2264 0.75 and 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV 2 \u2264 \u2206m2sol \u2264 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV 2 at the\n\n3\u03c3 confidence level, with the best fit values tan2 \u03b8sol = 0.37 and \u2206m2sol = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22125eV 2 [8].\n\nOn the theoretical side, hundreds of models for neutrino masses and mixings have been\npublished during the last few years. However, a survey of these models shows that most of\nthem yield the SMA or VAC solution for the solar neutrino problem[9], no matter whether the\nmodels produce the tiny neutrino masses directly at low energy or by the see-saw mechanism.\nIn the following we will give a brief comment on the neutrino models in the literature and\npoint out the difficulties in obtaining the LMA solution for the solar neutrino problem, and\nthen present our model.\nAs we know, the neutrino mixing, which is described by the MNS matrix[10], is actually\nthe mismatch between the two bases in which the mass matrix of the charged leptons or\nthat of the active neutrinos is diagonal. The neutrino models are thus generally divided\ninto two classes according to the origin of the large mixing angles: those from the charged\nlepton mass matrix ML or from the neutrino Majorana mass matrix M\u03bd . For the models\nwhich generate the large mixing angles in M\u03bd , it is usually difficult to reconcile the large\nmixing angles and a small mass squared splitting ratio r \u2261 \u2206m2sol /\u2206m2atm \u2248 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22122 ,\nwhich generally means a hierarchical structure of M\u03bd . The LMA solution in this kind of\nmodels is usually achieved by fine tuning the parameters in non-see-saw case or by choosing\na special hierarchy of the right handed neutrino spectrum in the see-saw case[9].\nFor models in which the large mixing angles coming from the charged lepton mass matrix\nthe situation is better, since the large mixing and the small mass ratio come from different\nmatrices. These models are either based on the beautiful idea of \"flavor democracy\"[11] or\n2\n\n\fon the idea of \"lopsided\" form[12, 13] of the charged lepton mass matrix. However, having\nlarge mixing angles in ML raises the question why large CKM angles do not arise from the\ndiagonalization of the quark mass matrices MD and MU . Especially, in grand-unified models\nthe Dirac mass matrices MD , MU and ML are generally closely related.\nThe answer to this question in the \"flavor democracy\" models is that the CKM angles\nare small by a cancellation caused by an approximate symmetry between MU and MD .\nThis kind of models can predict a bi-maximal form of the MNS matrix by diagonalizing the\ncharged lepton mass matrix and assuming the neutrino mass matrix diagonal at the same\ntime. However, this kind of models tend to give a too large solar neutrino mixing angle near\nmaximality, which is at most marginally consistent with the LMA parameter space.\nThe \"lopsided\" form of the charged lepton mass matrix is another elegant idea to give\nlarge lepton mixing while keeping small quark mixing at the same time. It is usually realized\nin the context of grand unified models, especially if an SU(5) symmetry plays a role in the\nform of the fermion mass matrices. In a SU(5) grand unified model, the left handed charged\nleptons are in the same multiplets as the CP conjugates of the right handed down quarks.\nSince the large mixing angle \u03b8atm is attributed to the mixing of the left-handed leptons in\nsuch models, it would generally be related by SU(5) to a large mixing angle for the righthanded down quarks, which is not observable. On the other hand, the small CKM angles\nare related by SU(5) to small mixings of the right-handed leptons, which are irrelevant to\nneutrino oscillation phenomena.\nHowever, in most published models the \"lopsided\" form only accounts for the largeness\nof \u03b8atm and a SMA or VAC solution for the solar neutrino problem is usually predicted. To\nobtain a LMA solution in such models requires a right handed neutrino mass matrix with a\ncomplicate form and fine tuning of the parameters to some extent[12, 13].\nOne exception is given by K. S. Babu and S. M. Barr, where both the large solar and\natmospheric neutrino mixing angles can be accounted for by diagonalizing the charged lepton\nmass matrix[14]. In their model, the charged lepton mass matrix has the following \"lopsided\"\n\n3\n\n\fform 1 :\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f8\n\n\u2032\n\uf8ec 0 0 \u03c1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nML = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 \u03b4 \u03c1 \uf8f7 mD ,\n\n\u03b4\u2032 \u01eb 1\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03c1\u2032 \u223c \u03c1 \u223c 1, \u03b4 \u223c \u03b4 \u2032 \u226a \u01eb \u226a 1. The parameters are determined by fitting the quark\nand lepton spectra and mixing angles. The unique nontrivial prediction of the model is Ue3\nelement in the MNS matrix by diagonalizing ML , which is |Ue3 | \u2243 0.05. This prediction will\nprovide a test of this model.\nHowever, most \"lopsided\" models predict a similar result of Ue3 \u2243 0.05. Thus a measurement of Ue3 \u2243 0.05 will not discriminate this model from others. Furthermore, the lepton\nflavor violating process \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 gives very strong constraints on the element Ue3 [15, 16]. It is\npointed out in [15] that the \"lopsided\" models, which always give a large \u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 mixing and a\ntypical value of Ue3 \u2243 0.05, may lead to the branching ratio of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 exceeding the present\nexperimental upper limit in the supersymmetric see-saw case. This will be explained below.\nActually, most \"lopsided\" models are realized in supersymmetric unified SO(10) models and\nthe neutrino spectrum and mixing are given by see-saw mechanism. Thus, it seems that all\nthese models meet the same difficulty in predicting the branching ratio of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3.\nWe have found a form of the charged lepton mass matrix independently when we tried to\nconstruct a \"lopsided\" model which can account for the LMA solution of the solar neutrino\nproblem and simultaneously avoid the above difficulty on \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 decay. Our model is similar\nto the form (1) in the large elements in the third column but different in the structure of the\nfirst two columns. It gives a completely different prediction of Ue3 and the branching ratio of\n\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 can be below the present experimental limit. In the following we shall first give our\nmodel and its features and then explain the smallness for Ue3 . In the last we shall discuss\nbriefly its implication on the lepton flavor violating process \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 in supersymmetric\nsee-saw case.\nThe aim of the work is to present a phenomenological model to account for the neutrino\noscillation data and avoid the \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 difficulty. The mass matrices of the charged lepton\n1\n\nHere we use the convention that a left-handed doublet multiplies the Yukawa coupling matrix from the\nleft side while a right-handed singlet multiplies the matrix from the right side.\n\n4\n\n\fand neutrino are assumed to have the following form:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f8\n\n\u03c3 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 \u03b4\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nML = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u2212\u03b4 0 1 \u2212 \u01eb \uf8f7 m,\n0 \u01eb\n\n1\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec m1 0\n\uf8ec\n\nM\u03bd = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 m2\n\uf8ed\n\n0\n\n(2)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 ,\n\n0 m3\n\n(3)\n\n\uf8f8\n\nwith \u03c3 \u223c O(1), \u01eb \u226a 1, \u03b4 \u226a \u01eb. Similar to form (1) the model extends the usual \"lopsided\"\nform of the charged lepton mass matrix between the second and the third generations to\ninclude the first generation. For simplicity we have assumed that M\u03bd is diagonal here. The\nmain feature of the model will not be changed if mixing in M\u03bd is small. Taking the values\nof the parameters\n\u03b4 = 0.00079, \u01eb = 0.12, and \u03c3 = 0.55\n\n(4)\n\nwe can obtain the correct mass ratios me /m\u03bc , m\u03bc /m\u03c4 and the MNS matrix\n\nVM N S\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8ec 0.851 \u22120.525 \u22120.0056 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0.362 0.595 \u22120.718 \uf8f7 .\n\n0.380 0.609\n\n0.696\n\n(5)\n\nThis model then predicts the neutrino mixing parameters as\nsin2 2\u03b8atm = 0.999, tan2 \u03b8sol = 0.38 and Ue3 = \u22120.0056.\n\n(6)\n\nThe notable feature of form (2) compared with the usual \"lopsided\" models is the order\n1 element \u03c3. We can see from Eq. (5) that by choosing a large (2, 3) and (1, 3) elements\nin ML we get two large mixing angles, which are corresponding to the maximal mixing of\nthe atmospheric neutrinos and the large solar neutrino mixing in the LMA solution, by\ndiagonalizing the charged lepton mass matrix. In this phenomenological model we separate\nthe large angles \u03b8atm and \u03b8sol from the small mass ratio \u2206m2sol /\u2206m2atm completely. Thus\nit is very easy to reconcile the large mixing angles and the neutrino spectrum of the LMA\nsolution without any fine tuning.\nUnlike the \"flavor democracy\" models, which usually predict a bi-maximal MNS matrix,\nour model gives the best fit value of \u03b8sol for the LMA solution. It is unlike the usual\n5\n\n\f\"lopsided\" models either, which predict a small lepton mixing angle between the first and the\nsecond generations with a typical value of\n\nq\n\nme /m\u03bc \u2248 0.07[12, 13]. This phenomenological\n\nform may provide a new possibility of model-building for the fermion masses and mixing.\nBesides \u03b8atm \u2248 \u03c0/4 the prediction of Ue3 = \u22120.0056 is quite non-trivial, since all the\nparameters are fixed by the lepton mass ratios and the solar neutrino mixing angle. This\nprediction is different from most other \"lopsided\" models, including that given in Ref. [14].\nIt thus provides a test of our model.\nThe smallness of Ue3 can be explained as following. The charged lepton mass matrix ML\ncan be diagonalized by a bi-unitary rotation\n\nUL\u2020 ML UR\n\n=\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec me\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\nm\u03bc\nm\u03c4\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nThe MNS matrix is defined by UM N S = UL\u2020 U\u03bd , where U\u03bd is the unitary matrix diagonalizing\nthe neutrino mass matrix and U\u03bd = I here. Thus UM N S is given by UL . UL can be approximately obtained by rotating the left-handed charged leptons so that the right-upper triangle\nof ML in (2) becomes zeros. This can be achieved by three steps. First we rotate the first\ntwo generation charged leptons by a matrix\n\nV12\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8ec c12 s12 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u2212s12 c12 0 \uf8f7 ,\n\n0\n\n0 1\n\n(8)\n\nwith c12 = cos \u03b812 , s12 = sin \u03b812 and tan \u03b812 = \u03c3/(1 \u2212 \u01eb). Then the 1 \u2212 3 element of ML\nbecomes zero and the 2 \u2212 3 element becomes \u03c3 \u2032 =\n\nq\n\n\u03c3 2 + (1 \u2212 \u01eb)2 . The second step is a\n\nsimilar rotation between the second and the third generations, V23 , with tan \u03b823 = \u03c3 \u2032 , which\n\nmakes the 2 \u2212 3 element of ML zero. The final step is a small rotation V12\u2032 which makes the\n1 \u2212 2 element zero. The rotation angle is \u03b8\u2032 \u223c\n= \u2212 c12 \u03b4 . We then get the unitary matrix\n12\n\ns23 \u01eb\n\n\u2020\n\nUL\u2020 = V \u2032 12 V23\u2020 V12\u2020 ,\n\n(9)\n\n\u2032\nfrom which we have that \u03b8atm \u223c\nsin \u03b823 . Using the expres= \u2212\u03b823 , \u03b8sol \u223c\n= \u2212\u03b812 and Ue3 \u223c\n= \u03b812\n\nsions of the diagonal elements of the resulting triangular matrix Ue3 can be approximately\nexpressed by mass ratio and physical mixing angles as\nme\nUe3 \u223c\n* U\u03bc3 / tan \u03b8sol .\n=\nm\u03bc\n6\n\n(10)\n\n\fOn the other hand, the Ue3 from (1) can be expressed by\nme\nUe3 \u223c\n* U\u03bc3 .\n=\u2212\nm\u03bc\ns\n\n(11)\n\nFrom the Eqs. (10) and (11) we can see that, for large \u03b8sol , Ue3 in our model is suppressed\ncompared to that in Ref. [14] due to the smallness of me /m\u03bc . The difference in the dependence of Ue3 on the mass ratio of me /m\u03bc originates from the different structures in ML in\nthese two models.\nA Ue3 \u223c 0.05 is at the edge of the parameter space measurable in the next generation\n\nlong baseline neutrino experiments, which may improve the present sensitivity to sin2 2\u03b813\n\nby an order of magnitude, probing sin2 2\u03b813 at the level of 0.01[17]. To discriminate the two\nkinds of models, an entry-level neutrino factory is necessary, which can probe sin2 2\u03b813 down\nto 10\u22123 [18]. If no \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bde signal is observed even at this level, most of the \"lopsided\" models\nmay then be ruled out. If Ue3 is indeed as small as that in our model, the high-performance\nneutrino factory, which can probe sin2 2\u03b813 down to the order of 10\u22124, will be necessary to\nmeasure its value[19].\nAs for the quark sector, we will not discuss it in detail here. We only want to point\nout that a large (1, 3) element in ML will not lead to a large quark mixing if the relation\nMD \u223c MLT is satisfied. Unlike the large elements in the mass matrices, the relations between\nthe small matrix elements in the quark sector and those in the lepton sector depend on the\ndetails of the grand-unified models used. The simplest possible form of the down quark mass\nmatrix is obtained by first adding a small (3, 1) element and a coefficient \u2212 13 in front of \u01eb in\nML , and then transposing it. Then MD can produce acceptable down quark spectrum and\nmixing angles.\nFinally, we discuss the case that the neutrino mass matrix is generated by the see-saw\nmechanism,\nM\u03bd = \u2212MN MR\u22121 MNT ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere MN is the neutrino Dirac mass matrix. In this case we can modify our assumption\nto that the charged lepton mass matrix of the form in Eq. (2) is given in the basis where\nthe Dirac neutrino mass matrix MN is diagonal. Generally the right-handed Majorana mass\nmatrix MR may be non-diagonal. Then M\u03bd in Eq. (12) is not diagonal and deviates from\nEq. (3). If mixing in MR is small, this deviation is small and the main feature of our\nmodel described above remains intact. Another possibility is that MN is hierarchical and\n7\n\n\fthis structure transfer to M\u03bd through the see-saw mechanism[9]. Taking hierarchy of MN\nsimilar to that of up quarks as suggested in SO(10) grand unified models and assuming no\nlarge hierarchy among the elements of MR\u22121 , we find that the mixing in M\u03bd is tiny, which\nalmost do not change the values of VM N S in Eq. (5).\nThe main virtue of the assumption that ML has the form (2) in the basis where MN\nis diagonal is that it can avoid the contradiction with the \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 experiments when the\n\"lopsided\" form is realized in the supersymmetric see-saw case. In this case and if supersymmetry breaking is mediated by gravity the soft SUSY breaking terms will introduce new\nlepton flavor violating sources. The mechanism is that there are two Yukawa coupling matrices YL and YN in the lepton sector for the charged leptons and neutrinos at the energy scale\nabove the right-handed neutrino masses. They are proportional to ML and MN respectively.\nThese two Yukawa coupling matrices can not be diagonalized simultaneously and will lead\nto lepton flavor mixing, in analogy to the flavor mixing in the quark sector. This lepton\nflavor mixing can transfer to the scalar lepton sector through quantum effects. The masses\nof sleptons are usually assumed to be universal at the SUSY breaking scale to avoid the\nlow energy flavor problems. The flavor mixing effects in the scalar lepton sector in the low\nenergy region can then be given approximately by\nMGU T\n1\n,\n(13)\nVi3 Vj3\u2217 * YN23 (3 + a2 )m20 log\n2\nij\n8\u03c0\nMR\nwhere (\u03b4m2L\u0303 )ij is the non-diagonal terms of the scalar lepton mass matrix, representing the\n\u0010\n\n\u03b4m2L\u0303\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2248\n\nlepton flavor mixing between the i-th and the j-th generations. YN3 is the third generation\nYukawa coupling of neutrinos, which dominates over the first two generations. V is the\nmixing matrix in the lepton sector. The loop effect with internal SUSY particles is much\nmore effective than that with internal neutrinos in producing the \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 process so that the\n\nrate of this process is determined by (\u03b4m2L\u0303 )12 , which is proportional to V23 V13\u2217 . Since there is\na very high experimental sensitivity to the process \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 (Br(\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3) < 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 [21]),\n\u221a\nand V23 is large (around 1/ 2) in \"lopsided\" models, V13 is thus very strongly constrained.\nIn the usual \"lopsided\" models, with the typical value of Ue3 \u223c 0.05, the branching ratio\nof \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 is then given by[15]\nBr(\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3) \u2248 C * 10\n\n\u22127\n\n\u0012\n\n100 GeV\nms\n\n\u00134\n\ntan \u03b2\n10\n\n!2\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\n< 1T eV\nwhere C is around 1 \u223c 10. Thus, if the common SUSY particle mass scale, ms , is \u223c\nand tan \u03b2 is not too small, then the branching ratio should be above the present experimental\n8\n\n\flimit. This fact has been noticed by a few authors[15, 16]. However, in our model, by the\nassumption that ML has the form (2) in the basis where MN is diagonal, V13 can be as small\nas \u22120.0056. Since the rate for the process \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 is approximately proportional to V132 it is\ngreatly suppressed compared to it's value in the usual \"lopsided\"models. Our model predicts\na branching ratio of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 not too much smaller than the present experimental limits and\neasily to be detected in the future experiments[22]. This is an important difference of our\nmodel from the model of Ref. [14]. Like the usual \"lopsided\" models, Ref. [14] predicts a\n\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 branching ratio already exceeding the present experimental limit.\nThe process \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 is another promising process to determine whether there is a large\nmixing between the second and the third generations in the charged lepton sector, since its\nrate is proportional to |V23\u2217 V33 |2 . If both processes are found in the future experiments in the\nrange of 10\u22126 > Br(\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3) > 10\u22129 and 10\u221211 > Br(\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3) > 10\u221214 [21, 22], our model,\n\nwith a large 2 \u2212 3 mixing while very small 1 \u2212 3 mixing, will be a very attractive candidate\nto accommodate the observations.\nIn summary, we have constructed a phenomenological form of the charged lepton mass\nmatrix, which provides a new possibility in model construction. This form can produce\nthe large solar neutrino mixing angle and the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing angle\nsimultaneously without any fine tuning. With such a charged lepton mass matrix it is very\neasy to build a neutrino model to explain the observed neutrino oscillation experiments. The\nunique prediction of this model is that Ue3 = \u22120.0056, which is different from predictions\nof all other \"lopsided\" models . This prediction can be tested in neutrino factory. This\nmodel has another virtue that it predicts the branching ratio of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 below the present\nexperimental limit but may be not too much smaller than it in the SUSY-GUT see-saw case.\nIf both the \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 processes are detected in the near future experiments, our\nmodel will be an attractive candidate to explain the experimental results.\n\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under the\ngrand No. 10105004 and No. 19835060.\n\n[1] Y.
