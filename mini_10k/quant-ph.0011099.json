These statistics are well described by random matrix\ntheory (RMT) in which the Hamiltonian of the specific system under consideration is replaced by a matrix where each element is an independent random\nvariable except for global symmetries required by the Hamiltonian [1]. Beside\nthe universal aspects, some statistical properties may also depend on the particular system under consideration. The main tool to study all these phenomena\nis the Gutzwiller trace formula that gives a semiclassical approximation to the\ndensity of states in terms of the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical\nsystem [2]. The application of this formula has satisfactorily explained some\nstatistical properties that agree with RMT for chaotic systems [3]. Nevertheless, there is no satisfactory complete explanation yet for the universal random\ncharacter of the spectrum appearing from a specific Hamiltonian.\nRecently, Kottos and Smilansky have studied very simple quantum systems\ncalled quantum graphs that display statistical spectral fluctuations belonging to\nthe class of systems with a chaotic classical limit [4, 5]. A remarkable aspect of\nthe quantum graphs is that there exists an exact trace formula that expresses\n\u2217 to\n\nappear in Journal of Statistical Physics\n\n1\n\n\fthe density of states in terms of the periodic orbits of the corresponding classical dynamics in a similar way as the Gutzwiller formula does for Hamiltonian\nsystems. These nontrivial features of these extremely simple systems have made\nthem natural toy models of quantum chaology.\nIn the same perspective, several papers have been very recently devoted to\nthese systems [6, 7, 8, 9]. On the one hand, Kottos and Smilansky have studied\nscattering processes in quantum graphs showing that these systems display all\nthe features which characterize quantum chaotic scattering [6]. On the other\nhand, the analysis of the statistical spectral fluctuations on graphs has been\nconsidered by Schanz and Smilansky [8] as well as by Berkolaiko and Keating\n[9]. These last authors have studied for star graphs the two-point correlation\nfunction, a quantity which reflects the long-range spectral correlations. In their\nanalysis they introduce ensemble averages (for example over the lengths of the\nbonds) in order to get a formula which is exploited by a combinatorial analysis.\nIn the present article, our aim is different in two main aspects. Firstly,\nwe want to consider the spacing probability distribution, which reflects shortrange spectral correlations and, secondly, we want to study the dependence of\nthis distribution on the parameters of the system, in particular, on the bond\nlengths. Accordingly, we do not introduce external average but we develop a\nmethod based on ergodicity. With this purposes, we derive a general formula\nfor the level spacing probability distribution in quantum graphs using a very\nsimple ergodic theorem. This formula applies more generally, too every system\nwith levels determined by the zeros of a quasi-periodic secular equation. The\nresult being exact, it contains all the information on the particular system. To\nobtain the universal behavior observed in some graphs from this result, further\nassumptions and simplifications should be made. We do not address here this\ndifficult problem. Instead we apply our result to very simple graphs, which\nnevertheless gives interesting results (such as level repulsion) and which can\nguide the approach to more difficult and interesting cases.\nIn Section 2, we review some results about the quantum mechanics on graphs.\nIn Section 3, we derive our main result, which is a general formula for the level\nspacing probability distribution given in terms of a Poincar\u00e9 mapping defined in\na certain surface of section \u03a3. In Section 4, we use the density of states for graphs\nto obtain information about \u03a3. In Section 5, we illustrate our result with some\nsimple graphs. In Section 6, we compare the level spacing distribution obtained\nnumerically for a complex graph, with the result of RMT. Then, in Section 7,\nwe compare our result with a related theory proposed by Berry. Conclusions\nare drawn in Section 8.\n\n2\n\nEnergy levels of quantum graphs\n\nIn this section, we introduce the main results known about the energy levels of\nquantum graphs in order to be complete. We refer to the works of Kottos and\nSmilansky for details[5].\nGraphs are vertices connected by bonds. Each bond b = (i, j) connects two\n\n2\n\n\fvertices, i and j. On each bond b, the component \u03a8b of the total wave function\n\u03a8 is a solution of the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Here we consider\nthe time reversible case (i.e. without magnetic field)\n\u2212\n\nd2\n\u03a8b (x) = k 2 \u03a8b (x),\ndx2\n\nb = (i, j) ,\n\nwhere k is the wavenumber. Moreover, the wave function must satisfy boundary\nconditions at the vertices of each bond (i and j in the previous equation), which\nensures continuity and current conservation, i.e.,\n\u03a8b (0) = \u03c6i\nfor all the bonds b which start at the vertex i and\n\u03a8b (lb ) = \u03c6j\nfor all the bonds b which end in the vertex j. The length of the bond b is denoted\nby lb or l(i,j) . The current conservation reads\nX\u2032 d\n\u03a8b (x)\ndx\n\nx\u21920\n\n= \u03bbi \u03c6i\n\nP\u2032\nwhere\ndenotes a summation over all the directed bonds which have their\norigin at the vertex i. These conditions guarantee that the resulting Schr\u00f6dinger\noperator is self-adjoint. Note that, in this formulation, each bond has two\ndirections and we have to distinguish between the two different directions of a\nbond. This means that the dimension of the vector \u03a8 = [\u03a81 (x), . . . , \u03a82B (x)]T\nis 2B where B is the number of bonds of the graph.\nWhen \u03bbi \u2192 \u221e (Dirichlet boundary conditions) the graph becomes a union of\nnoninteracting bonds. These are called \"integrable graphs\" because the classical\ndynamics corresponds to particles bouncing in the bonds leading to a phase\nspace with the topology of a torus. We come back to this case in Subsection\n5.4. For finite \u03bbi , the asymptotic properties of the spectrum become independent\nof \u03bb at high wavenumbers and, indeed, there is a convergence to the Neumann\nlimit where all the \u03bb's are equal to zero. In what follows we consider this case.\nAs a result of the boundary conditions, we get the secular equation which\ncan be written in the following equivalent ways\ndet[I \u2212 S(k)] = 0\n\n(1)\n\nwith S = D(k)T a unitary matrix of dimension 2B where\nDab = \u03b4ab eikla ,\n\nwith\n\nla = lb\n\n(2)\n\nand\nTab = \u2212\u03b4ab\u0302 +\n3\n\n2\nvi\n\n(3)\n\n\fif the bonds a and b are connected through a vertex (here called i) and zero\notherwise. The notation b\u0302 defines the reverted b bond.\nThe secular equation can also be written as\ndet h(k) = 0\nwhere h is a matrix of dimension V (V is the number of vertices in the graph)\ngiven by\nhij (k) =\n\n\u001a\n\nP\n\u2212 m6=i cot kl(i,m) Cim\n(sin kl(i,j) )\u22121 Cij\n\nif i = j\nif i =\n6 j\n\n(4)\n\nCij being the connectivity matrix with elements equal to one if the vertex i is\nconnected to j and zero otherwise.\nIt is clear from both secular equations that the eigenvalues are given by the\nzeros of an almost-periodic function.\nUsing Eqs. (1), (2), and (3), it is possible to write the quantization condition\nin terms of the zeta function\ni\nYh\n\u03b3p\n\u03b6(k) =\n1 \u2212 e\u2212 2 np ei(kLp +\u03bcp \u03c0) = 0\np\n\nwhere p denotes a periodic orbit, np is its period, Lp is its length, \u03b3p is related\nto the stability\nP of the orbit and \u03bcp is the analogue of the Maslov index. Note\nthat Lp = i mi li where the mi are integer numbers. If we define xi = kli we\ncan see that \u03b6(k) = \u03b6(x1 = kl1 , . . . , xB = klB ) with\ni\nP\nYh\n\u03b3p\n1 \u2212 e\u2212 2 np ei( i mi xi +\u03bcp \u03c0)\n\u03b6(x1 , . . . , xB ) =\n(5)\np\n\nNote that \u03b6(x1 , . . . , xB ) is 2\u03c0-periodic in each of the variables, so that \u03b6(k)\nis an almost-periodic function. It can happen that the lengths of the graph\nare not all incommensurate. In that case, it is convenient to define a new\nfunction F (x1 , . . . , xn ) where n is the number of incommensurate lengths, which\ngives \u03b6(k) when evaluated in x1 = kl1 , . . . , xn = kln (here l1 , . . . , ln are the\nincommensurate lengths) , i.e.,\nF (x1 = kl1 , . . . , xn = kln ) = f (k) = \u03b6(k)\n\n3\n3.1\n\nLevel spacing distribution for almost-periodic\nfunctions\nThe level spacings as the first-return times of a Poincar\u00e9\nmapping\n\nIn this section, we derive the probability distribution for the spacing between\nthe successive zeros of an almost-periodic function f (k). Let us call {kl }\u221e\nl=0 the\nordered solutions of f (k) = 0.\n4\n\n\fThe probability of having two successive zeros at a distance (s, s + ds) is\ngiven by\nP (s)ds = lim\n\nK\u2192\u221e\n\n#{kl \u2264 K : s \u2264 kl+1 \u2212 kl \u2264 s + ds}\n#{kl \u2264 K}\n\nor equivalently by\nN \u22121\n1 X\n\u03b4[s \u2212 (kl+1 \u2212 kl )]\nN \u2192\u221e N\n\nP (s) = lim\n\n(6)\n\nl=0\n\nBy the definition of f (k), there exists a function F (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) such that\nf (k) = F (x1 = kl1 , x2 = kl2 , ..., xn = kln )\nwhere the parameters l1 , l2 , ..., ln are incommensurate real numbers, which, for\nthe case of graphs, form the set of incommensurate lengths, and from which all\nthe other lengths can be obtained by linear combinations with rational coefficients.\nThe function F (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) is periodic in each of its arguments xi with\na prime period Pi . Accordingly, we can consider the function F on a torus\nT n : 0 \u2264 xi \u2264 Pi with i = 1, ...n.\nThe equation\nF (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) = 0\n\n(7)\n\ndefines a hypersurface \u03a3 on T n .\nThe equations\ndxi\n= li\ndk\n\n(i = 1, . . . , n)\n\n(8)\n\ndefine a flow on this torus. In Eq. (8), the wavenumber k plays the role of\nthe time. Because of the incommensurability of the \"frequencies\" li this flow\nhas the remarkable property of being ergodic. We will exploit this property of\ndynamical systems theory to obtain the desired expression for the level spacing\nprobability distribution.\nFirst, we note that each intersection of the trajectory {xi = kli }ni=1 with the\nsurface \u03a3 gives a zero kj \u2208 {kl }\u221e\nl=0 . Therefore, this surface plays the role of a\nPoincar\u00e9 surface of section for the present dynamical system.\nIn this hypersurface of section, the flow induces a Poincar\u00e9 map\n\u001a\n\u03ben+1 = \u03c6(\u03ben )\n(9)\nkn+1 = kn + \u03c4 (\u03ben )\nwhere \u03ben is a point on \u03a3 that is mapped by the flow on \u03ben+1 also in \u03a3. These\ntwo points are the successive intersections of the trajectory {xi = kli }ni=1 with\nthe surface \u03a3 at the times kn and kn+1 respectively. \u03c4 (\u03be) is the time of first\nreturn to the surface of section \u03a3.\n5\n\n\fFrom Eqs. (9), we have that\nkn+1 \u2212 kn = \u03c4 [\u03c6n (\u03be0 )]\nin which \u03be0 is an initial condition belonging to \u03a3 where the iteration started.\nNow, we can write the spacing probability distribution (6) in the form\nN \u22121\n1 X \b\n\u03b4 s \u2212 \u03c4 [\u03c6l (\u03be0 )]\nN \u2192\u221e N\n\nP (s) = lim\n\n(10)\n\nl=0\n\nThe ergodicity implies that the value of the distribution (10) is almost everywhere independent of the initial condition \u03be0 , so that \u03be0 can be any point on\nthe torus T n and not necessary one corresponding to a zero. Moreover, the\nergodicity implies the existence of a measure \u03bd on \u03a3 which gives the spacing\nprobability distribution according to\nZ\nP (s) =\n\u03bd(d\u03be) \u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c4 (\u03be)]\n(11)\n\u03a3\n\nWe now turn to the determination of this invariant measure \u03bd.\n\n3.2\n\nThe invariant measure \u03bd\n\nWhen the lengths li are incommensurate, the dynamical system (8) is ergodic\non the torus.

From Eq. (21), we see that\nu = 0 is the equation that defines \u03a3 and, as we noticed after Eq. (17), there\nare two solutions t(0) = 0 or t(0) = \u03c4 (\u03be) in the new coordinates. But since t is\nthe \"time of flight\" after the last crossing, we consider the second solution and\nwe finally get\nZ\n1\nd\u03be J(\u03be) \u0398[s \u2212 \u03c4 (\u03be)] .\n(22)\nI= n\n|T | \u03a3\nFrom Eqs.

(23) and the normalization condition 0 P (s)ds = 1.\nAccordingly, we can write the spacing probability density as\nR\nd\u03be J(\u03be) \u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c4 (\u03be)]\n(25)\nP (s) = \u03a3 R\nd\u03be J(\u03be)\n\u03a3\n\nwhich is the central result of this paper. The expression (25) has a very simple\ngeometrical interpretation. It gives the spacing probability density as the ratio\nbetween the flux of the probability current l\u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c4 (\u03be)] through the surface \u03a3\nand the flux of the constant velocity field l through the same surface \u03a3.\nFrom Eq. (25), we can conclude that the invariant measure \u03bd in (11) is given\nby\nd\u03be J(\u03be)\n.\nd\u03be J(\u03be)\n\u03a3\n\n4\n\n\u03bd(d\u03be) = R\n\nThe density of states as a sum rule for graphs\n\nIn the previous section, we derived a formula which relates the density of zeros of\nan almost-periodic function to the properties of the surface of section \u03a3 defined\nin a torus. The dimension of the torus equals the number of incommensurate\nlengths and the periodicity Pi in each variable depends on the relations between\nthe length li and those which are commensurable with it. For example, if there\nis a length commensurable with l1 , i.e., lk = pq l1 then the variable x1 will have\nthe period P1 = 2\u03c0q. In the case where the relation is of the form lk = nl1 ,\nor all the lengths are incommensurable, we can always consider that Pi = 2\u03c0,\n\u2200i. In what follows, we consider this to be the case. As a consequence, we can\nrewrite Eq. (24) as\nhdi =\n\n1\n(2\u03c0)n\n\nZ\n\nd\u03be J(\u03be)\n\n(26)\n\n\u03a3\n\nAs we have already pointed out, this expression has the geometrical interpretation of a constant flux l through the surface \u03a3. Because of the periodicity of\n\u03a3 in the n-dimensional real space Rn , we expect that the projection of \u03a3 in all\nof the n directions covers the complete plane. (This would be false if \u03a3 was a\nclosed surface but we suppose that this is not the case.) Therefore, if we call \u03a3i\nthe projection of \u03a3 in the ith direction we have\nZ\nZ\n1 X\n1\ndsi\nl\nd\u03be\nJ(\u03be)\n=\nhdi =\ni\n(2\u03c0)n \u03a3\n(2\u03c0)n i\n\u03a3i\nR\nand \u03a3i dsi = mi (2\u03c0)n\u22121 with mi the number of sheets of \u03a3 for the projection\nin the ith direction. Consequently, we have\n1 X\nhdi =\nmi l i .\n(27)\n2\u03c0 i\n9\n\n\fThe number mi can be determined for each particular case by inspection on the\nquantization formula [for example Eq. (1)].\nHere, our purpose is to revert the argument and use this formula to obtain\nthe mi . This is possible because there is a general expression for the density.\nFor graphs, the density of states was obtained in Ref. [5] using the properties\nof (1), (2) and (3) together with a formula for the density of states derived in\nthe approach of scattering quantization. The result is simply given by\nhdi =\n\nLtot\n.\n\u03c0\n\nFrom Eqs. (27)-(28), we get the desired equation for the mi 's\nX\nmi li = 2Ltot\n\n(28)\n\n(29)\n\ni\n\nSince the sum is only performed over the incommensurate lengths, forming a\nbasis from which all other lengths can be obtained, this equation gives all the\nmi because we can write Ltot in such a basis.\nWe can deduce from here that when all the lengths are incommensurable\nthere will be two sheets in each projection.\nIt is possible to reduce the \"volume\" of the torus by noticing that, in fact,\nwe do not need the function F (x1 , . . . , xn ) to be periodic but the surface \u03a3.\nSince this surface is given by F (x1 , . . . , xn ) = 0, the period Pi with which the\nsurface is repeated in Rn is given by the smallest of the period or anti-period\nof the function in the variable xi [i.e., the values Pi for which F (x1 , . . . , xi +\nPi , . . . , xn ) = \u00b1F (x1 , . . . , xi , . . . , xn )]. Note that we call it again Pi but there\nis no risk of confusion. Moreover, in the rest of the paper, we shall use this\ndefinition.\n\n5\n\nApplication to simple systems\n\n5.1\n\nA three-bond star graph with three different bond\nlengths\n\nLet us consider the simple graph composed by three bonds attached to a vertex.\nThe spectrum of this graph is given by the zeros of the function\nf (k) = cos kl1 cos kl2 sin kl3 + cos kl1 sin kl2 cos kl3 + sin kl1 cos kl2 cos kl3 (30)\nThe function (30) is an almost-periodic function. Let us define\nG(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = cos x1 cos x2 sin x3 + cos x1 sin x2 cos x3 + sin x1 cos x2 cos x3\nThis function is 2\u03c0-periodic in each argument but has an anti-period \u03c0. It\nsatisfies\nG(x1 = kl1 , x2 = kl2 , x3 = kl3 ) = f (k)\n10\n\n\fThe equation G(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = 0 defines a surface \u03a3 with a double cone joined\nby a singular point. The singular point is given by x1 = \u03c02 , x2 = \u03c02 , x3 = \u03c02 (see\nFig. 1). For simplicity, we translate the coordinate system to that point so that\nwe consider the function\n\u0010\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\u0011\n\u03c0\nF (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = G x1 \u2212 , x2 \u2212 , x3 \u2212\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\ndefined on the torus \u2212 2 < xi \u2264 2 .\n\nFigure 1: Plot of the surface \u03a3 for the three-bond star graph with three different\nlengths. The plot is obtained from G(x1 , x2 , x3 ) = 0.\nAs we saw in Section 3, the shape of the surface \u03a3 determines the level\nspacing probability distribution. For small spacings s, the distribution is given\nby the iterations with short \"times of flight\". These are determined by intersections near the singularity of \u03a3 because there are arbitrarily close points in its\nneighborhood. In order to study the behavior of the level spacing probability\ndistribution for small spacings we carry out our analysis near the singular point\nwhere the function F can be approximated by the quadratic function\nF (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = x1 x2 + x1 x3 + x2 x3 + O(x3i )\nWe diagonalize the quadratic form with a rotation of coordinates and we finally\nget\nF (y1 , y2 , y3 ) = 2y12 \u2212 y22 \u2212 y32 + O(yi3 ).\n11\n\n(31)\n\n\f\u221a\ni\nIn the y-coordinates, the flow is given by dy\n= ei where e1 = (l1 + l2 + l3 )/ 3,\ndk\n\u221a\n\u221a\ne2 = (l2 \u2212 l3 )/ 2, e3 = (l2 + l3 \u2212 2l1 )/ 3. Now, we apply our theory. We define\nnew coordinates through the transformation (y1 , y2 , y3 ) \u2192 (\u03b7, \u03be, t)\ny1\ny2\n\n= s1 (\u03b7, \u03be) + e1 t\n= s2 (\u03b7, \u03be) + e2 t\n\ny3\n\n= s3 (\u03b7, \u03be) + e3 t\n\n(32)\n\nwhere the functions si (\u03b7, \u03be) are zeros of Eq. (31), i.e., 2s21 \u2212 s22 \u2212 s23 = 0. A\nsolution is\nr\n\u03b72 + \u03be 2\ns1 (\u03b7, \u03be) = \u2212\n2\ns2 (\u03b7, \u03be) = \u03b7\n(33)\ns3 (\u03b7, \u03be) = \u03be\nEqs. (32) and (33) define the new variables. We need to compute J and \u03c4 (\u03b7, \u03be).\nFor J, the calculation is straightforward. Using (20) and (33), we get\n\nwhere\n\nb(\u03b7, \u03be)\nJ= p\n2(\u03b7 2 + \u03be 2 )\n\ni\nh p\nb(\u03b7, \u03be) = 2e1 s1 \u2212 e2 s2 \u2212 e3 s3 = \u2212 e1 2(\u03b7 2 + \u03be 2 ) + e2 \u03be \u2212 e3 \u03b7 + O(2)\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n\nThe notation O(2) means here \"to second order in \u03b7, \u03be or t\". If we write Eq.\n(31) in the new coordinates we get\nF (\u03b7, \u03be, t) = \u03b12 t2 + 2 t b(\u03b7, \u03be) + (2s21 \u2212 s22 \u2212 s23 ) + O(3)\n\n(36)\n\nwhere b is defined by Eq. (35) and\n\u03b12 = 2e21 \u2212 e22 \u2212 e23 = 2(l1 l2 + l2 l3 + l1 l3 )\n\n(37)\n\nThe third term in Eq. (36) is zero by definition. In the new coordinates, the\nsurface of section \u03a3 is given by the roots of F (\u03b7, \u03be, t) = 0, i.e., t = 0 and\nt = \u2212 \u03b12b2 . The function \u03c4 (\u03b7, \u03be) represents the \"time of flight\" of a trajectory\nwhich starts at one point on the lower cone with coordinates (\u03b7, \u03be) and arrives\nto the upper cone. That is\ni\nhp\n2 + \u03be2) + e \u03be \u2212 e \u03b7\n2(\u03b7\n2\n2\n3\n2b\n\u03c4 (\u03b7, \u03be) = \u2212 2 =\n+ O(2)\n(38)\n\u03b1\n2e21 \u2212 e22 \u2212 e23\nNow we are ready to compute P (s) for small s using (25). As we have already\nnoticed the integral in the denominator is just the density of states which is\nhdi =\n\nl1 + l2 + l3\n\u03c0\n12\n\n(39)\n\n\ffor this graph. The integral in the numerator is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n|b(\u03be, \u03b7)|\n2b\nI = d\u03be d\u03b7 p\n\u03b4 s + 2 + O(s2 )\n\u03b1\n2(\u03be 2 + \u03b7 2 )\n\nwhich is performed by changing to a variable u(\u03be) = s + \u03b12b2 where \u03b7 is kept constant, by using (38), and then by integrating in \u03b7. The details of this calculation\nare left to the reader. The result is\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u0011 23 s\nI=\n+ O(s2 )\n2\n\u03c02\n\nThis, together with (37) and (39), gives\n\n3\n\nP (s) =\n\n(l1 l2 + l1 l3 + l2 l3 ) 2 s\n+ O(s2 )\nl1 + l2 + l3\n\u03c0\n\nUsually, we express this probability density in the scaled variable \u2206 such that\nthe mean level spacing is equal to unity:\n3\n\nP (\u2206) = \u03c0\n\n(l1 l2 + l1 l3 + l2 l3 ) 2\n\u2206 + O(\u22062 )\n(l1 + l2 + l3 )3\n\n(40)\n\nWe observe that this simple graph already presents the Wignerian level repulsion, a property usually associated to chaotic classical dynamics. To our\nknowledge, there are only a few systems for which this result can be derived\nexactly.\nIn Fig. 2, the cumulative function is depicted as a function of \u22062 and\ncompared with a numerical calculation of the spacing distribution. The slope\nat the origin is half of the slope of P (\u2206). The straigth line in the figure has half\nof the slope given by (40). We see that there is very good agreement between\n(40) and the numerical result.\nThere is an interesting point about this result. The slope of (40) takes values\nbetween zero and \u03c03 \u223c 0.6 as the lengths l1 , l2 , l3 vary. Therefore, the slope\n32\nonly varies on a relatively small interval. This means that changing the length\nof the bonds (but always keeping them irrationally related) does not change\nvery much the slope of the spacing probability density P (\u2206). Moreover, we\nnote that the dependence on the lengths can be seen as a quotient between two\ndifferent averages of the lengths (a geometric average and a arithmetic one).\nIt is also interesting to notice in Fig. 1 that the projections of the surface \u03a3\nonto each axis cover the corresponding plane only once in the torus of volume\n\u03c0 3 , which is implied by the formula (29) of Section 4 and by Eq. (39).\n\n5.2\n\nA three-bond star graph with two different bond lengths\n\nNow, we consider the same graph as in the previous subsection but with only\ntwo different lengths, say l1 , l2 . Taking l1 = l3 in (30), we get the function\nwhich gives the zeros for this graph\nf (k) = cos kl1 (2 sin kl1 cos kl2 + sin kl2 cos kl1 )\n13\n\n\f1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nF\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u22062\n\n2\n\n3\n\nR\u2206\nFigure 2: Plot of the cumulative function F = 0 P (\u2206\u2032 )d\u2206\u2032 of the level spacing\ndistribution, as a function of \u22062 for the three-bond star graph. The straight\nline is the prediction obtained by integration of Eq. (40). Here, l1 = \u03c0, l2 =\n3.183459012, and l3 = 3.1442336073.\nWe now introduce the function\nF (x1 , x2 ) = cos x1 (2 sin x1 cos x2 + sin x2 cos x1 )\nsuch that F (x1 = kl1 , x2 = kl2 ) = f (k). The function F (x1 , x2 ) is \u03c0 periodic in\nx1 and \u03c0 anti-periodic in x2 and can be considered in the torus 0 < xi \u2264 \u03c0 with\ni = 1, 2. In Fig. 3, we draw the lines where F (x1 , x2 ) = 0 in the plane (x1 , x2 ).\nChanging the origin of the coordinates to the singular point ( \u03c02 , \u03c02 ) corresponds\nto analyze the function\nG(x1 , x2 ) = \u2212 sin x1 (2 sin x2 cos x1 + sin x1 cos x2 )\nNote that around the singularity the function G can be approximated by the\n2\nquadratic form 2x1 x2 +\nR x1 . In this example, we explicitly obtain the density of\n1\nstates using hdi = \u03c0n \u03a3 J d\u03be. First, we identify the surface \u03a3 as the union of\ntwo lines \u03a31 and \u03a32 as indicated in Fig. 3 so that\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\nZ\n1\nhdi = 2\nJ d\u03be\nJ d\u03be +\n\u03c0\n\u03a32\n\u03a31\n14\n\n\fx1\nP\n3\n\n2\n\nA\n\nA\nC\n\n1\n\nB\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n2D\n\n3\n\n2\n\nC\n\nx2\n\nB\n\n-1\n\n2Q\n\nFigure 3: Schematic representation of the torus for the problem of Subsection\n5.2. The surface \u03a3 is composed of the x1 -axis and of the curved curve. The\ntrajectories that cross the surface \u03a3 belong to the region A, B, C or D. Note in\nthe figure that the regions D are one next to each other that is why we put 2D.\nwhere \u03a31 is given by sin x1 = 0, i.e., \u03a31 = {x1 = 0, \u2212 \u03c02 < x2 < \u03c02 }.

In Fig. 3, we notice that there are two sheets of \u03a3 with projection\nonto x2 and only one with projection onto x1 as expected from the formula (29)\nof Section 4.\nLet us compute the level spacing probability density P (s). From the symmetry of Fig. 3, we recognize four regions (A, B, C, D), each one repeated twice.\nFor three of these regions (A, B, C), a trajectory joins a straight line with a\ncurved one. For the other region (D), two curved lines are joined. In this\nrespect, we need two expressions for the \"time of flight\": \u03c41 (\u03be) and \u03c42 (\u03be).\nThe \"surface of arrival\" is determined by 2 sin x2 cos x1 + sin x1 cos x2 = 0,\n\n15\n\n\fi.e., x2 = \u2212 arctan\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0001\ntan x1 .

From the\nperiodicity of the arctangent function, the next solution [let us call it t2 (\u03be)] gives\nthe time to cross the following surface (see Fig. 3) so that \u03c42 (\u03be) = t2 (\u03be) \u2212 \u03c41 (\u03be).\nSince the parameter \u03be moves in the x2 -axis, we can write\nZ\nZ P\nZ 0\nJ \u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c4 (\u03be)] d\u03be = 2l1\n\u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c41 (\u03be)] d\u03be + 2l1\n\u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c42 (\u03be)] d\u03be\n\u03a3\n\n0\n\nQ\n\nwhere P = \u03c0 and Q = \u2212 l2l2 \u03c01 .

If \u03c42 (Q) \u2261 l\u03c01 \u2212 2\u03c41 (\u2212 l2l2 \u03c01 ) < s < \u03c4P we get\nZ\n\n0\n\nQ\n\n\u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c42 (\u03be)] d\u03be =\n\n\u001a\nl2 +\n\n2l1\n1 + 3 cos2 l1 [s + \u03c41 (\u03be(s))]\n\n\u001b\u22121\n\nand zero if s > \u03c4P .

Nevertheless, in the numerical example considered below,\nthe interval L\u03c0tot \u03c42 (Q) < s < L\u03c0tot \u03c4P where \u0393(\u2206) is different from zero is small\nand we can consider a simple approximation for \u0393(\u2206).\nif\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\nP\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n\u2206\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nFigure 4: Numerical and theoretical level spacing probability densities for the\ngraph of 3 bonds with 2 different lengths, l1 = \u03c0 and l2 = 1.53183459.\nConsider l1 = \u03c0 and l2 = 1.53183459012. Thus, we get L\u03c0tot \u03c42 (Q) = 1.345 and\n= 1.522. Therefore, \u0393(\u2206) is different from zero in the interval 1.345 <\n\u2206 < 1.522 as can be observed in Fig. 4. In this interval, we can consider\n\u03c42 (\u03be) as a linear function of \u03be (from Fig. 3 we see that the dependence on \u03be is\nQ\n.\nin fact smooth).

A more accurate comparison can be done through the cumulative\nR\u2206\nfunction F (\u2206) = 0 d\u2206\u2032 P (\u2206\u2032 ).

The zeros are determined by the function\nf (k) = F (x1 = l1 k, x2 = l2 k) where\nF (x1 , x2 ) = (cos x2 \u2212 1) sin x1 + (cos x1 \u2212 1) sin x2\n\n(44)\n\nThis function is 2\u03c0-periodic in each variable and the surface \u03a3 obtained by\nF (x1 , x2 ) = 0 is considered in the torus \u2212\u03c0 < x1 < \u03c0 and \u2212\u03c0 < x2 < \u03c0. It is\neasy to see that this surface is composed by \u03a31 = {x1 = 0, \u2212\u03c0 < x2 < \u03c0}, \u03a32 =\n{x2 = 0, \u2212\u03c0 < x1 < \u03c0} and \u03a312 = {x1 + x2 = 0, \u2212\u03c0 < x2 < \u03c0}. These three\nsheets intersect at the singular point x1 = x2 = 0. The function F (x1 , x2 ) = 0\ncan thus be replaced by the cubic form x1 x2 (x1 + x2 ) = 0.

We have confirmed this result with numerical calculations\n(data not shown).\nAnother graph of a similar type is the one composed by a bond and a loop\nattached to a vertex. This graph has the form of a nine. Here, the surface of\nsection \u03a3 is given by the equation\nF (x1 , x2 ) = 2 cos x1 cos x2 \u2212 2 cos x1 \u2212 sin x1 sin x2\n19\n\n(46)\n\n\fThe surface can be considered in the torus \u2212\u03c0/2 < x1 < \u03c0/2 and \u2212\u03c0 < x2 < \u03c0\nand it is given by\n\u03a31\n\u03a32\n\n= {x2 = 0, \u2212\u03c0/2 < x1 < \u03c0/2}\n\n= {tan x1 = 2(cos x2 \u2212 1)/ sin x2 , \u2212\u03c0 < x2 < \u03c0}\n\nIn this example, the calculation is similar to the one for the star graph with\nthree bonds of two different lengths and we do not present it here. We only\ncompute P (\u2206) in the limit \u2206 \u2192 0. For the small spacings, we can consider\nthe quadratic form around the singularity at (x1 = 0, x2 = 0) which is given by\nF (x1 , x2 ) \u2243 x1 x2 + x22 for x1 , x2 small enough. With this approximation the\ncalculation is similar to the one of the previous graph. The result is P (\u2206) \u2192\nl2\nl1 +l2 when \u2206 \u2192 0.\n\n5.4\n\nGraphs with disconnected bonds\n\nThe formula (25) can be used to study the spacing distribution for the \"integrable graphs\" discussed in [5]. These graphs are obtained by imposing Dirichlet\nboundary conditions on the vertices and are called integrable because the classical dynamics in the graph correspond to a particle that bounces in a bond in\na periodic motion which corresponds to a torus in phase space. In this case, the\neigenvalues are obtained by the equations\nsin klb = 0 ,\n\n\u2200b ,\n\ni.e.,\nF (x1 , . . . xn ) =\n\nn\nY\n\nsin xi = 0\n\ni=1\n\nwhich is the equation for the surface \u03a3. This surface is composed of all the\nfaces of the n-dimensional cube which defines\nthe torus when we identify the\nS\ncorresponding boundaries, so that \u03a3 = i \u03a3i with \u03a3i = {xi = 0, 0 < xj <\n\u03c0 , \u2200j 6= i}\nIn this case, the level spacing probability density (25) is given by\nZ\n\u03c0 1 X\nP (s) =\nJk \u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c4k (sk )] dsk\n(47)\nLtot \u03c0 n\n\u03a3k\nk\n\nwhere\nJk\nand\n\n\u03c4k (sk )\n\n= lk\n= min\nj6=k\n\n20\n\n(\n\n\u03c0 \u2212 x0j \u03c0\n,\nlj\nlk\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(48)\n\n\fIn the Appendix, we prove that Eq.

We\nobserve that, for two bonds, the distribution is constant (except for the delta\npeak) and that, for three bonds, it decays linearly. In Fig. (8), we plot (49) and\nthe numerical result for a graph of eight disconnected bonds. We observe the\nvery nice agreement with the formula (49), as well as the convergence toward\nthe Poisson distribution.\nWe want to comment on the deviations with respect to the Poisson distribution. First, we observe a maximum spacing which is easy n\nto understand.\nThe\no\n\"regular\" spectrum consists in a superposition of spectra \u03c0 lni (i.e., equally\nspaced levels). The largest spacing in this superposition is equal than the spacing l\u03c01 where l1 is the largest of the lengths l. In the scaled variable of unit\n. This maximum spacing will appear repeatedly over\nmean spacing, this is Lltot\n1\nthe whole k-axis creating the delta peak in the distribution.\nThere is another interesting deviation with respect to the Poissonian distribution. We can see from (49) that the probability density of finding two levels\nP l2\nin coincidence is P (0) = 1 \u2212 i L2i < 1.

Figure 9 shows the deviations with respect to a Poisson distribution for two sets of lengths and the difference between them.

The long dashed line\nrepresents the difference between the densities evaluated with (49) in the two\ndifferent cases.\nment is very good some systematic deviations exist. In figure 11 we plot these\ndeviations for three different sets of lengths. We can see that they are very\nclose to each other showing that the fluctuations are independent of the graph\nlengths. The dot-dashed line in figure 11 represents the fluctuations around\nRMT for a fully connected tetrahedron [5]. We can conclude from these results\nthat the fluctuations around RMT depend on the topology of the graphs but\ndoes not depend much on their lengths. Moreover, we observe that the pentagon\n(a graph of 5 vertex, 10 bonds and valence 4) has bigger deviations with respect\nRMT than the tetrahedron (a graph of 4 vertex, 6 bonds and valence 3). This\nbehavior is reminiscent of an observation in [5] that for a star graph of 15 bonds\nthe form factor deviates more from RMT that for a star of 5 bonds (see also\n[9]). These results would suggest that the valence plays a role in the deviations\nwith respect to RMT.\n\n24\n\n\f1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nF\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u2206\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 10: Cumulative function of the level spacing distribution for a fully\nconnected pentagon.

He noticed that, for\na typical Hamiltonian with real eigenfunctions (which is the same situation as\nthe one we consider here), it is necessary to vary two parameters in order for\ntwo levels to be degenerate. This is the content of a theorem originally due to\nvon Neumann and Wigner. It also implies that, in the three-dimensional space\nof the two parameters A and B and of the energy E, the eigenvalue surface\nE = E\u00b1 (A, B) has the form of a double cone with its sheets joined at the\n\"diabolical point\" (A\u2217 , B \u2217 , E \u2217 ), where A\u2217 , B \u2217 are the parameters for which the\ndegeneracy occurs. Following Berry, these cones are distributed in the space\n(A, B, E) according to a unknown probability distribution \u03c1(A, B, E). Berry\nhas also considered a probability distribution which rules the geometry of the\ncones [\u03c0(a, b, c) where a, b, c are the parameters in the quadratic form which\ndefines the cone].\nThe level spacing probability distribution is given by the average (6) over\nenergy, which can be considered in the semiclassical limit where infinitely many\n25\n\n\f0.008\n\n0.004\n\n0\n\n\u03b4F\n\n\u22120.004\n\n\u22120.008\n\n\u22120.012\n\n\u22120.016\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n\u2206\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 11: Deviations of the cumulative function of the spacing distribution for\ndifferent complex graphs with respect to the RMT result: \u03b4F = F \u2212FRMT . The\nlong dashed line represents this deviation for a fully conected pentagon with the\nsame set of lengths as in figure 10. The dashed line represents this deviation for\nthe lengths Li = 0.4li with the li of the first set in figure 9 and the solid line for\nthe lengths Li = 0.14li with the li of the second set in figure 9.

As a consequence, the level spacing is given for small\nspacings by the successive crossings of the conical surfaces with the line (E, A =\nA0 , B = B0 ) where A0 and B0 are the parameters of the actual Hamiltonian\nunder study. Berry argues that, since there is nothing special about the system\nwith the parameters (A0 , B0 ), the energy average can be augmented by an\nensemble average over a region (A, B) near (A0 , B0 ). Whereupon, the level\nspacing becomes\nZ\nZ\np\n\u03c1(A0 , B0 , E)\nP (\u2206) =\nda db dc \u03c0(a, b, c) dA dB \u03b4(\u2206 \u2212 aA2 + 2bAB + cB 2 )\nhd(E)i\nAfter the change of variables \u03b1 = A/\u2206, \u03b2 = B/\u2206, the previous equation gives\nP (\u2206) \u223c \u2206\nwhere the proportionality factor involves a geometric average. Berry's argument\nshows that the level spacing density should vanish linearly in generic systems\nbecause of the level repulsion, as expected from random matrix theory.\n26\n\n\fThe main difference between Berry's derivation and our derivation is that he\nintroduces by hand the ensemble average. In our derivation, the ensemble average naturally appears from a rigorous equivalence between the energy average\nand the ensemble average given by the ergodic theorem. This ensemble average\nintroduced by ergodicity has the advantage of keeping all the specificities of the\nsystem, i.e., the dependence on the lengths of the graph. We expect that these\nspecificities disappear for graphs which are sufficiently large, in a way which has\nstill to be understood for graphs with connected bonds.\n\n8\n\nConclusions and discussion\n\nIn this article, we have derived a formula for the spacing probability distribution\nof the energy levels of quantum graphs and, more generally, for systems where\nthe secular equation is given by an almost-periodic function. Our formula is\nbased on the ergodic properties of a continuous-time dynamical system defined\non a torus. This ergodic flow induces a Poincar\u00e9 map in a certain surface of\nsection which corresponds to the locus of the energy eigenvalues in the phase\nspace of the flow. The level spacings are explicitly related to the times of first\nreturn in the surface of section. The level spacing distribution is thus given\nby the distribution of the first-return times of the ergodic flow in the Poincar\u00e9\nsurface of section.\nWe have applied this formula to different graphs. In general, the slope of\nthe spacing density P (\u2206) at \u2206 = 0 depends on the system parameters and we\nhave been able to calculate explicitly this dependence in several graphs.\nWe have also studied in detail the \"regular\" spectrum of integrable graphs.\nOne important application of our formula (25) is the following\nTheorem:\nIf the bonds of the graph are disconnected so that the spectrum is a superposition of n independent equally spaced spectra of wavenumbers and if the bond\nlengths are mutually incommensurable, the level spacing probability distribution\nis exactly given by Eq. (49) when the distribution is expressed in the variable\nwhere the level density is equal to one. The distribution (49) converges to the\nPoisson distribution in the limit n \u2192 \u221e.\nOn the other hand, for large connected graphs, the level spacing distribution is close to the Dyson-Gaudin-Mehta spacing distribution of RMT although\ndeviations are numerically observed which depend mainly on the topology of\nthe quantum graph. The deviations with respect to RMT are more important\nfor smaller graphs than for larger graphs but the effect of Wigner repulsion is\nstill present in very small graphs where we observe that the spacing density also\nvanishes linearly like P (\u2206) \u223c \u2206.\nThe different results we have obtained can be understood on the basis of\nthe general properties of the surface of section \u03a3, which plays a particularly\nimportant role. First of all, we remark that the surface \u03a3 is defined as the\nset of the zeros of f (k) = F (kl1 , ..., kln ) = 0 in the n-dimensional phase space\n(x1 = kl1 , ..., xn = kln ) of the ergodic flow. Therefore, the surface \u03a3 is of di27\n\n\fmension n \u2212 1 in this space. According to the von Neumann-Wigner theorem,\ntwo zeros are generically degenerate only if two constraints are imposed on the\nparameters of the systems which are here the lengths li of the bonds. Consequently, the dimension of the subset of these degeneracies is n \u2212 3, generically.\nIn the following, we refer to this subset as the singular manifold.\nThe aforementioned generic situation is already encountered in graphs with\nthree incommensurate lengths for which the phase space of the ergodic flow is\nof dimension n = 3, the surface of section \u03a3 of dimension n \u2212 1 = 2, and the\ndegeneracy subset of dimension n \u2212 3 = 0. Indeed, in the example of Subsection\n5.1, the surface \u03a3 forms a cone with a self-intersection at a point. This example\nshows that a spacing density vanishing linearly is generically possible as soon\nas there are three incommensurate lengths.\nHowever, for graphs with only two incommensurate bond lengths, only two\nbehaviors are generic: either (1) P (0) 6= 0 or (2) P (\u2206) = 0 for 0 < \u2206 < \u2206c . For\nsuch graphs, the torus is two-dimensional and the surface giving the eigenvalue\nis one-dimensional, i.e., a line on the torus. Generically, this line may intersect\nitself leading to the case (1), or it may have no intersection leading to the\ncase (2). Therefore, generically, we should not expect a spacing density which\nvanishes linearly like P (\u2206) \u223c \u2206 for a graph with only two incommensurate\nlengths. This result is illustrated with the examples of Subsections 5.2 and 5.3.\nIn the two dimensional examples, we notice that the singular manifold has\nthe dimension n\u22122 and is a point on a two-dimensional torus and, as a corollary,\nP (\u2206) starts with a finite value. This last result is supported by the fact that,\nfor the non-generic integrable systems, two levels can come in degeneracy by\nvarying only one parameter. Indeed, the singular manifold is of dimension n \u2212 2\nfor the disconnected \"integrable graphs\" because the surface \u03a3 is composed by\nthe faces of the cube and their intersections are of dimension n \u2212 2, as we saw in\nSubsection 5.4. This discusion shows that the graphs with two incommensurate\nlengths belong to a non-generic class because the singular manifold can never be\nof dimension n \u2212 3 for n = 2. It is important to notice that this statement does\nnot contradict Berry's theory because he considers general Hamiltonian systems\nwhere the levels are given by an equation like f \u0303(k, l1 , l2 ) = 0 (if we call l1 and\nl2 the two parameters that enter in his theory) which allows the existence of a\ncone in the (k, l1 , l2 ) space, while, for graphs with two incommensurate lengths,\nthe secular equation has the special form f \u0303(k, l1 , l2 ) = f (kl1 , kl2 ) = 0 which\ndoes not allow the existence of such a cone.\nIn summary, the important point which makes the difference in the behavior\nof P (\u2206) at small spacings \u2206 is the dimension of the singular manifold which\nis n \u2212 3 for the repulsion and a distribution as P (\u2206) \u223c \u2206, but n \u2212 2 for the\nclustering and a distribution as P (\u2206) \u223c constant.\nWe notice that the degree of the polynomial that describes the surface around\nthe singular point seems to be not essential for this matter because we have\nrepulsion and clustering for cases where the surface around the singular point\nis given by a quadratic form [see Subsection 5.1 Subsection 5.2 and Eq. (46)].\nWe have also seen an example with clustering [see Eq. (44)] where the surface\nis described by a cubic form.\n28\n\n\fWe have not commented on the topology of the singular manifold. It can\nhappen that the intersection of two surfaces is transverse or tangent and this\nwill influence the behavior of P (\u2206) near \u2206 = 0. In all the examples that we\nconsider, the intersection is transverse which is the generic case when there is\nno restriction on the kind of surface.\nSeveral extensions of this work are possible. We may wonder which are the\ngeneric properties of the surface \u03a3 and the function \u03c4 (\u03be) for typical graphs and\napply the formula (25) to such generic situations. We notice that there are\nsome restrictions on \u03a3. In particular, the number of sheets with projection in\na given direction depends on the number of bonds with lengths associated with\nthis direction, as we have seen in Section 4. There can be other restrictions\nas a consequence of the properties of the Hamiltonian (hermiticity, etc). In\nthis problem, a difficulty comes from the fact that the dimension of the torus\nis equal to the number of incommensurate lengths in the graph. This makes\ndifficult the study of complex graphs. Another possible direction is the study of\nperturbations of integrable graphs. Such perturbations are expected to deform\nthe surface \u03a3 and we may investigate the transition from our quasi-Poissonian\ndistribution (49) to the RMT distribution.\nSince the graphs of the kind that we have discussed here have been used to\nmodel transport in mesoscopic systems, our work can find interesting applications in this context.\n\nAppendix\nHere, we derive Eq. (49) from Eq. (47). The strategy is to divide the surfaces\n\u03a3k into regions where the minimum, which appears in the definition (48) of\n\u03c0\u2212x0j\n\n\u03c4k (sk ), takes a given form. We call Rkj the region where \u03c4k (sk ) = lj\nj 6= k and Rkk the region where \u03c4k (sk ) = l\u03c0k .\nFirst, we compute\nZ \u03c0\nZ \u03c0\nZ\ndx0n \u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c41 (x02 , . . . , x0n )]\ndx02 * * *\nds1 \u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c41 (s1 )] =\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03a31\n\nn \u03c0\u2212x0\n\nwith\n\no\n\nj\n\u03c0\nwith \u03c41 (s1 ) = minj6=1\nlj , l1 .\nConsider the flow (8) introduced in Section 3:\n\nx1\n\n= l1 t\n\nxi\n\n= li t + x0i ,\n\ni = 2, . . . , n\n\n(50)\n\nWe look after any region in the surface \u03a31 where \u03c41 (x02 , . . . , x0n ) = l\u03c01 .

Note that these regions are outside\nthe border given by (53) as one expected.\nThus, one has\n!\nZ\nZ \u03c0\u2212 llm (\u03c0\u2212x0j )\nn\nXZ \u03c0\nY\n\u03c0 \u2212 x0j\nj\n0\ndsk \u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c4k (sk )] =\ndxm \u03b4 s \u2212\n\u0011\n\u0010\nl\nlj\n\u03a3k\n\u03c0 1\u2212 lj\n0\nj6=k\n\n1\n\nm6={j,k}\n\n(62)\n\nor more explicitly\nZ\n\n\u03a3k\n\ndsk \u03b4[s \u2212 \u03c4k (sk )] =\n\nn\nX\nj6=k\n\n\uf8ee\n\nlj \uf8f0\n\nn\nY\n\ni6={j,k}\n\n31\n\n\uf8f9\n\n(\u03c0 \u2212 li s)\uf8fb \u0398\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0\n\u2212s\nl1\n\n\u0013\n\n(63)\n\n\fFinally, we substitute the results (56) and (63) in (47) and we get\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nn X\nn\nn\nn \u0012\nX\nY\nY\n1\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nl1 \uf8f0\nli \uf8fb\n(\u03c0 \u2212 li s)\uf8fb \u0398\n+ n\u22121\nlj lk \uf8f0\n\u2212s\n\u03b4 s\u2212\nP (s) =\n1\u2212\nLtot\nl1\nl1\n\u03c0\nLtot\nl1\nk=1 j6=k\n\ni6=1\n\ni6={j,k}\n\n(64)\n\nwhich gives Eq.
