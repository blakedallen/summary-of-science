Introduction\nLet G = (V, E) denote a connected graph (without loops) with vertex (site) and edge\n(bond) sets V and E. Let n = v(G) = |V | be the number of vertices and e(G) = |E| the\nnumber of edges in G. A spanning subgraph G\u2032 is a subgraph of G with v(G\u2032 ) = |V |,\nand a tree is a connected subgraph with no circuits. A spanning tree is a spanning\nsubgraph of G that is a tree (and hence e(G\u2032 ) = n \u2212 1). A problem of fundamental\ninterest in mathematics and physics is the enumeration of the number of spanning trees\non the graph G, NST (G). This number can be calculated in several ways, including as a\ndeterminant of the Laplacian matrix of G and as a special case of the Tutte polynomial\nof G [1, 2]. In this paper we shall present an exact closed-form result for the asymptotic\ngrowth constant for spanning trees on the d-dimensional body-centered cubic lattice,\ndenoted bcc(d), with bcc(3) \u2261 bcc. We shall also give an exact integral expression for\nthe zf cc describing the face-centered cubic lattice and an exact closed-form expression\nz488 for the 4 * 8 * 8 lattice. A previous study on the enumeration of spanning trees and\nthe calculation of their asymptotic growth constants was carried out in Ref. [3]. In that\nwork, closed-form integrals for these quantities were given, and from the integral for the\nbcc(d) lattice, an infinite series representation was derived. Our present result for the\nbcc(d) lattice is obtained by summing exactly this infinite series. Similarly, our present\nresult for the 4 * 8 * 8 lattice is obtained by an exact closed-form evaluation of the integral\ngiven for this lattice in Ref. [3].\n2. Background and Method\nWe briefly recall some definitions and background on spanning trees and the\ncalculational method that we use. For G = G(V, E), the degree ki of a vertex vi \u2208 V\nis the number of edges attached to it. A k-regular graph is a graph with the property\nthat each of its vertices has the same degree k. Two vertices are adjacent if they are\nconnected by an edge. The adjacency matrix A(G) of G is the n\u00d7n matrix with elements\nAij = 1 if vi and vj are adjacent and zero otherwise. The Laplacian matrix Q = Q(G)\nis the n \u00d7 n matrix Q with Qij = ki \u03b4ij \u2212 Aij . One of the eigenvalues of Q(G) is always\nzero; let us denote the rest as \u03bbi (G), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1. A basic theorem is that [1, 2]\nQn\u22121\nNST (G) = (1/n) i=1\n\u03bbi (G). Here we shall focus on k-regular d-dimensional lattices \u039b.\nFor these lattices, if d \u2265 2, then in the thermodynamic limit, NST grows exponentially\nwith n as n \u2192 \u221e; that is, there exists a constant z\u039b such that NST (\u039b) \u223c exp(nz\u039b ) as\nn \u2192 \u221e. The constant describing this exponential growth is thus given by\nz\u039b = lim n\u22121 ln NST (\u039b) .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u039b, when used as a subscript in this manner, implicitly refers to the thermodynamic\nlimit of the lattice \u039b. A regular d-dimensional lattice is comprised of repeated unit cells,\neach containing \u03bd vertices. Define a(\u00f1, \u00f1\u2032 ) as the \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bd matrix describing the adjacency\nof the (d-dimensional) vertices of the unit cells \u00f1 and \u00f1\u2032 , the elements of which are\ngiven by a(\u00f1, \u00f1\u2032 )ij = 1 if vi \u2208 \u00f1 is adjacent to vj \u2208 \u00f1\u2032 and 0 otherwise. Assuming that\n\n\fSome Exact Results for Spanning Trees on Lattices\n\n3\n\na given lattice has periodic boundary conditions, and using the resultant translational\nsymmetry, we have a(\u00f1, \u00f1\u2032 ) = a(\u00f1\u2212 \u00f1\u2032 ), and we can therefore write a(\u00f1) = a(\u00f11 , * * * , \u00f1d ).\nIn Ref. [3] a method was derived to calculate NST (\u039b) and z\u039b in terms of a matrix M\nwhich is determined by these a(\u00f1, \u00f1\u2032 ). For a d-dimensional lattice, define\nX\nM(\u03b81 , * * * , \u03b8d ) = k * 1 \u2212\na(\u00f1)ei\u00f1*\u03b8\n(2)\n\u00f1\n\nwhere in this equation 1 is the unit matrix and \u03b8 stands for the d-dimensional vector\n(\u03b81 , * * * , \u03b8d ). Then [3]\nZ\nd\n1 \u03c0 hY d\u03b8j i\nln[det(M(\u03b81 , * * * , \u03b8d ))]\n(3)\nz\u039b =\n\u03bd \u2212\u03c0 j=1 2\u03c0\nFor a k-regular graph \u039b, a general upper bound is z\u039b \u2264 ln k. A stronger upper\nbound for a k-regular graph \u039b with coordination number k \u2265 3 can be obtained from\nthe bound [4, 5]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2 ln n\n(Ck )n\n(4)\nNST (G) \u2264\nnk ln k\nwhere\nCk =\n\n(k \u2212 1)k\u22121\nk\n\n[k(k \u2212 2)] 2 \u22121\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nWith eq. (1), this then yields [3]\nz\u039b \u2264 ln(Ck ) .\n\n(6)\n\nIt is of interest to see how close the exact results are to these upper bounds. For this\npurpose, we define the ratio\nz\u039b\nr\u039b =\n(7)\nln Ck\nwhere k is the coordination number of \u039b.\n3. bcc(d) Lattice\nFor the bcc(d) lattice a unit cell contains \u03bdbcc(d) = 2 vertices located at v1 = (0, * * * , 0)\nand v2 = ( 21 , * * * , 21 ). This lattice has coordination number kbcc(d) = 2d . Using eq. (3),\nRef.

First,\n\u221e\n1 X (l \u2212 1)!

Hence,\n\nzbcc(d) = d ln 2 \u2212 2\u2212(d+1)\n\nd+2 Fd+1 ([1, 1, 3/2, * * * , 3/2], [2, * * * , 2], 1)\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nWe comment on some special cases. For d = 1, the bcc(1) lattice with free\n(periodic) boundary conditions degenerates effectively to a line (circuit) graph, for\nwhich, respectively, NST = 1 and NST = n; in both cases, it follows that zbcc(1) = 0.\nUsing the value 3 F2 ([1, 1, 3/2], [2, 2], 1) = 4 ln 2, we recover this elementary result. For\nd = 2, the bcc(2) lattice is equivalent to the square lattice, for which zsq = (4/\u03c0)\u03b2(2) =\nP\nn\n\u2212s\n1.1662436..

Our general exact\nresult for zbcc(d) provides quite accurate values for higher values of d, which we list in\nTable 1, together with the corresponding ratios (7) which give a comparison with the\nupper bound (6). Evidently, the exact values are very close to this upper bound and\nmove closer as d increases.\n\n\f5\n\nSome Exact Results for Spanning Trees on Lattices\nTable 1.

Such a lattice can be defined by the ordered sequence of\npolygons that one traverses in making a complete circuit around the local neighborhood\nQ\nof any vertex. This is indicated by the notation \u039b = ( i pai i ), meaning that in this\ncircuit, a regular pi -sided polygon occurs contiguously ai times. We consider here the\n4 * 8 * 8 lattice involving the tiling of the plane by squares and octagons. In eq. (4.11)\nof Ref. [3], the asymptotic growth constant for this lattice was calculated to be\nZ\nZ\ni\n1 \u03c0 d\u03b81 \u03c0 d\u03b82 h\n1\nln 7 \u2212 3(cos \u03b81 + cos \u03b82 ) \u2212 cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82\nz488 = ln 2 +\n2\n4 \u2212\u03c0 2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 2\u03c0\nZ \u03c0\nh\ni\n\u221a\n1\n1\nd\u03b8 ln 7 \u2212 3 cos \u03b8 + 4 sin(\u03b8/2) 5 \u2212 cos \u03b8\n= ln 2 +\n(20)\n4\n4\u03c0 0\nwhere the integral on the second line of eq.

These integrals were evaluated\nnumerically to obtain the result z488 = 0.786684(1), where the number in parentheses\nindicates the estimated error in the last digit.\nWe have derived an exact closed form expression for this integral.

First, we note that\nI(1) = C/\u03c0, where C is the Catalan constant. Next, assume 0 \u2264 a < 1. Taking the\nderivative with respect to a and doing the integral over \u03c6 in eq.
