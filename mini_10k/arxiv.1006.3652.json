Studies in human behaviour have\nincreasingly attracted interest and attention from\nsimulation research in the UK (Robinson, 2004).\nDiscrete Event Simulation (DES) and Agent\nBased Simulation (ABS) are the two common\n\nsimulation approaches applied for modelling\nhuman behaviour in OR. The capability of\nmodelling human behaviour in both simulation\napproaches depends on their ability to model\ndiverse and heterogeneous populations, while\nSystem Dynamics Simulation (SDS) which is\nanother typical tool for system analysis is only\nappropriate to model up populations at an\naggregate level. Nevertheless, the question is:\nWhat kind of human behaviour can be modelled\nwith standard model designs in DES and ABS\nand how similar the results would be when one\nmodels the same human centric system with\nthose two different approaches? When discussing\ndifferent kinds of human behaviour, we refer to\nreactive and proactive human behaviour. On top\nof that, Rank et al. (2007) stressed that proactive\nbehaviour is a very important aspect to succeed\nin the service industry. Therefore, we picked\nretailing as part of the service industry for our\ninvestigation in this study.\nUndeniable, there are loads of human\ninteractions in retailing. In this study, reactive\nbehaviour refers to response of an available staff\nmember to the customers' requests while\nproactive behaviour relates to a staff member's\npersonal initiative in identifying and solving an\nissue. In retail, both behaviours; particularly\nproactive, play important roles in an\norganisation's ability to generate income and\nrevenue. Therefore, our general aim was to\ninvestigate the usefulness of modelling human\nreactive and proactive behaviour in the retail\nperformance using a combined DES/ABS\napproach. To achieve the aim, we produced a\nresearch question: What are the similarities and\ndissimilarities can be identified by modelling\nhuman reactive behaviour compared to both\nhuman reactive and proactive behaviour in the\nsimulation output performance? In answering the\nresearch question, we carried out a case study in\na departmental store which is one of the top ten\nretailers in the UK. In previous work, we had\nstudied capabilities of traditional DES and\n\n\fProceedings of the Operational Research Society Simulation Workshop 2010 (SW10)'\ncombined DES/ABS in representing the impact\nof reactive staff behaviour on system\nperformance (Majid et al, 2009). Currently, this\npaper focused on abilities of traditional DES and\ncombined DES/ABS in representing the impact\nof mixed reactive and proactive staff behaviour\non system performance. At the end of the study,\nfindings of both studies were compared.\nStatistical tests will be used to establish if the\ndissimilarities in output performance of the\ndifferent modelling methods are significant.\nFrom now on, we will refer the traditional DES\nmodel as the DES model whilst the combined\nDES/ABS model as the DES/ABS model.\nThe remaining content of this paper is presented\nas follows: Section 2 explores theory and\ncharacteristics of three major OR simulation\nmethods - DES, ABS, and SDS. This section\nalso discusses the comparisons between different\nsimulation methods that were obtained from the\nliterature. Then, Section 3 describes our case\nstudy plan, fieldwork and model design. Next,\nSection 4 presents our experimental setup,\nresults, analysis as well as some discussion on\nthe results. Finally, Section 5 will conclude the\noverall study as well as summarise our current\nprogress.\n2.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nABS models (also called individual based\nmodels) however, offer a more straightforward\nsolution to this issue. They contain active objects\n(agents) which possess the abilities of being\nautonomous, responsive, proactive and social\n(Jennings et al, 1998). ABS models are\nessentially decentralised, which means there is\nno place where the global system behaviour\n(dynamics) is defined. The modeller defines the\nbehaviour at the micro level (individual level)\nand the macro behaviour (system behaviour)\nemerges from the many interactions between the\nindividual entities (Borshchev and Filippov,\n2004). As agents are self-controlled (technically,\nevery agent has its own thread of execution,\nhence, the system is decentralised) they can\ninitiate events independently. In addition, with\nABS supports communication among the agents\nthrough message passing, which is a useful asset\nfor modelling human behaviour.\nSDS models represent a real world phenomenon\nusing stock and flow diagrams, causal loop\ndiagrams and differential equations. The inability\nof the SDS models to model heterogeneous\nindividual behaviour is the main limitation of\nthis approach in achieving the goal of this study.\nSDS models are unable to represent specific\nbehaviour such as reactive or proactive\nbehaviour of individuals in a system.\nConsequently, we excluded SDS modelling from\nour research study.\n\n2.1 Simulation\nOver the last three decades, simulation studies\nhave widely been used as a decision support tool\nin OR (Kelton, 2007). The ability to support\nstudies of complex systems has made simulation\nas the most preferred choice among\nacademicians and practitioners as compared to\nanalytical tools. The simulation modelling\nparadigms used in OR can be classified in three\ngroups: DES modelling, ABS modelling, and\nSDS modelling.\nDES models represent systems based on\nchronological sequences of events (technically\nthere is only one thread of execution, the system\nis centralised) where each event changes the\nsystem state in discrete time. It is difficult to\nrepresent proactive behaviour in DES models as\nusually people are implemented as resources or\npassive entities. Passive entities are unable to\ninitiate events. Therefore, a proactive event that\nrequires self-started behaviour by an individual\nentity is difficult to be implemented in DES.\n\n2.2 Retail and proactive behaviour modelling\nThe retail sector has been one of the main\ncontributors to the global market economy.\nExcellent customer service is vital in products\nmarketing as well as to maintain regular and to\nattract new customers. A good service is closely\nrelated to the ways staffs provides support to the\ncustomers. This behaviour is known as customer\nservice which is a part of every company's\nmanagement strategy. Service behaviour of a\nstaff member can be classified as either reactive\nor proactive towards the customer.\nAccording to Rank et al. (2007), since the 1990s\nvarious forms of proactive behaviour have been\nstudied by various organisation scientists. This is\nbecause, implementing proactive behaviour\nprovides\npotential\nsuccess\nin\ncareer\ndevelopment, organisational change, stress\nmanagement, etc. (Crant, 2000). On the other\nhand, to understand the potential benefit of\nsupporting proactive behaviour of a staff\n\n\fProceedings of the Operational Research Society Simulation Workshop 2010 (SW10)'\nmember, we need to study their behavioural\nperformance using OR methods. Siebers et al.\n(2009) has suggested the use of simulation when\none is interested in the development of a system\nover time. The authors also emphasised that\nmodelling and simulation of operational\nmanagement practices in the retail sector are\nfairly common, while people management\npractices are often ignored. We found that most\nof these models only involve modelling of\nhuman reactive behaviour. Therefore, in order to\nunderstand the integration of operational\nmanagement practices with human service\nbehaviour, we need to come up with a research\nthat involves modelling human reactive and\nproactive service behaviour. For such a study, we\nneed to identify the appropriate tools.\n2.3 The Simulation choice\nThis study was interested to investigate a service\noriented system in the retail sector, which\ninvolved queuing for the different services. As in\nABS models, the system itself is not explicitly\nmodelled but emerges from the interaction of the\nmany individual entities that make up the\nsystem, therefore, using ABS alone would not\ncorrespond to our investigations. However, as\nABS seems to be a good concept for representing\nhuman behaviour, we decided to try out a\ncombined DES/ABS approach where we\nmodelled the system in a process-oriented\nmanner while we modelled the actors inside the\nsystem (customers and staff) as agents. At the\nend of the study, we compared this approach\nwith a more traditional DES approach.\n3.\n\nFIELDWORK\n\nOur case study focused on the operations in the\nmain fitting room in a WomensWear (WW)\ndepartment of a departmental store (see Figure\n\n1). Simulation study is important for manager as\nit could help in identifying the potential impact\non fitting room performance when having\ndifferent numbers of fitting room cubicles,\ndifferent numbers of fitting room staff, different\nstaff roles, or empowering staff.\nWe simplify the real world reactive and\nproactive behaviour of the staff towards their\ncustomers and investigate how the behaviour\neffects on our simulation models. Reactive\nbehaviour refers to staff's response to customer\nwhen they are available and requested.\nTypically, a staff in the fitting room has to do\nthree reactive behaviour tasks: (1) counts the\nnumber of clothes and hands out a plastic card\nwhich contains the number of clothes taken in\nand the room number, (2) provides help while\ncustomers are in the fitting room, and (3) collects\nback the plastic card and any unwanted clothes\nwhen the customer leaves the fitting room area.\nOn the other hand, proactive behaviour refers to\na staff's self started behaviour, for example to\ndeal with various demands. The proactive\nbehaviour that we focused on was when a staff\nspeeded up their service when the fitting room\nwas getting hectic which resulted to timeconsuming service and customers had to wait\nlong to be served.\nBased on our case study observations in the real\nsystem, we developed the concept for a DES\nmodel that represented the basic process flow of\nthe department operations (a complex queuing\nsystem). We used this as a basis for both our\nconceptual models (for implementing the DES\nand the DES/ABS model later).\nThen we developed concepts of the proactive\nbehaviour representation for a process centric\napproach to be used in the DES model (see\nFigure 2) and for an individual centric approach\nto be used in the DES/ABS model (see Figure 3).\n\nFigure 1 An illustration of the main fitting room operations\n\n\fProceedings of the Operational Research Society Simulation Workshop 2010 (SW10)'\n\nFigure 2 Flow chart for DES\n\nFigure 3 Flow and state charts for DES/ABS\n\n\fProceedings of the Operational Research Society Simulation Workshop 2010 (SW10)'\nThe figure shows that a single process flow chart\ndiagram was used for the conceptual DES model.\nMeanwhile, for the conceptual DES/ABS model,\nwe employed a process flow chart diagram and\nadditional state charts diagrams to represent\ndifferent types of agents (customers, staff, and\nfitting rooms). State charts show the different\nstates an entity could be in and define the events\nthat cause a transition from one state to another.\n\nafter a standard business day (8 hours), mimicking the\noperation of the real department store. We conducted\n100 replications for each set of parameters. Both\nsimulation models used similar model input\nparameter values. Therefore, if any differences in the\nmodel outputs were noticed, they would be only due\nto the differences between the two modelling\ntechniques.\n4.2 Reactive and Proactive Behaviour Setup\n\n4.\n\nEXPERIMENTATION\n\n4.1 Basic Model Setup\nBased on both conceptual models presented in\nSection 3, we developed two simulation models.\nThese models were implemented in the multiparadigm simulation software AnyLogicTM (XJ\nTechnologies, 2009). Both simulation models\nconsisted of an arrival process (customers), three\nsingle queues (entry queue, return queue, help\nqueue), and resources (one sales staff, one fitting\nroom with 8 fitting cubicles). In our DES model\ncustomers, staff, and fitting rooms were all\npassive objects while in our DES/ABS model\ncustomers, staff, and fitting rooms were all active\nobjects (agents) in order to allow communication\namong them through message passing. In both\nsimulation models, we mimicked the real reactive\nand proactive behaviour of a sale staff towards\nthe customer.\n\n80\n\nCondition in the fitting room and number of waiting\ncustomers in the three queues were checked\ncontinuously via probability distribution. When the\ncondition was met, the service time was speeded up\nautomatically. After some delay performed by the\nprobability distribution, the new service time was\nchanged to the existing service time.\n\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n4-5 pm\n\n3-4 pm\n\n2-3 pm\n\n1-2 pm\n\n12-1 pm\n\n11-12 am\n\n10-11am\n\n0\n9-10 am\n\nNumber of Customers Arrived\n\nThe customer arrival rate as we observed in the\nreal system during a typical day is as shown in\nFigure 4 below.\n\nReactive and proactive behaviours for both simulation\nmodels were set up similarly. We pointed one staff\nmember that performed all three reactive jobs\nmentioned in Section 2, namely job 1 (counting\ngarments on entry), job 2 (providing help) and job 3\n(counting garments on exit). The staff served the\ncustomers by first come first serve approach. There\nwere few cases where we considered proactive\nbehaviour (staff changes their service times from\nnormal to fast) when there were customers queuing\nwhile fitting room cubicles were available or to get\nserved by the staff. In order to speed up the servicing\ntime, we reduced the normal service time by 20%.\nWe implemented this proactive behaviour using the\nprocedures shown in Figure 5. The decision making\nwas done based on a set of selection rules (using\ndecision tree solutions) and probabilistic distribution.\nEach block in Figure 5 represents the event as shown\nin Figure 6.\n\nObservation Time (by hour)\n\nFigure 4 Distribution of customer arrival in the\nreal system on a typical day\nIn our simulation models, we modelled the arrival\nprocess using an exponential distribution with an\nhourly changing arrival rate in accordance with\nFigure 4. The simulation models were terminated\n\nFigure 5 Proactive decision making\n\n\fProceedings of the Operational Research Society Simulation Workshop 2010 (SW10)'\n4.3 Experiment 1: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nEvent Check Condition\nFor < all fitting room cubicles >\nIf < fitting room cubicles is busy =\nfalse && customer waiting in\nentry queue >= number waiting >\nstart event change service time\nwithout delay;\nelse\nIf < customer waiting in return queue\n>= number waiting >\nstart event change service time\nwithout delay;\nelse\nIf < customer waiting in help queue >=\nnumber waiting >\nstart event change service time\nwithout delay;\n\nWe validated both our simulation models by\nconducting a sensitivity analysis where the customer\narrival rates were systematically varied (we increased\nit by 30% each time) and we observed how this\naffected our system performance measures (customer\nwaiting times from three queues, staff utilisation,\nnumber of service time changes, cubicle utilisation,\nnumber of customer served and number of customer\nnot been served).\n4.3.1 Sensitivity Analysis\nResults for the sensitivity analysis are shown in Table\n1 and Figure 7. The results in both figure and table\nillustrate that there were some similar patterns for all\nperformance measures. Both simulation models\ndemonstrated an increment for all performance\nmeasures when the customer arrival rate was\nincreased. We found, there were no differences in the\nresults of number of service time change in Figure 7\nbetween DES and DES/ABS models. However, from\nthe bar chart below shows that the DES/ABS model\nserved more customers compared to the DES model.\nThis result also means that the DES/ABS produces\nlower customer waiting times, higher staff serving\nutilisation, lower number of customer not served and\nhigher cabin utilisation compared to the DES model.\n\nEvent Change Service Time\nFor < staff >\nexisting service time = new\nservice time;\ncount the service time changes;\nstart event change to existing\nservice time by delay\n(probability distribution);\nEvent Change To Existing Service Time\nFor < staff >\nexisting service time = existing\nservice time;\n\nFigure 6 Proactive Behaviour Pseudo Code\n\nSimulation\nModels\n\nNumber\nof cubicles\n\nPerformance\nmeasures\nWaiting time\n\nDES\n\n8\n\nStaff\nutilisation\nCubicle\nutilisation\nNumber not\nserved\nNumber\nserved\nService time\nchanges\nWaiting time\n\nDES/ABS\n\n8\n\nStaff\nutilisation\nCubicle\nUtilisation\nNumber not\nserved\nNumber\nserved\nService time\nchanges\n\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\nMean\nSD\n\nNo of customer arrival (per day)\n1\n1.32\n0.92\n44%\n6.30\n66%\n4.05\n5\n4.37\n312\n18.54\n26\n14.41\n1.21\n1.15\n46%\n7.88\n66%\n10.34\n9\n15.79\n300\n49.70\n24\n15.54\n\n2\n7.68\n1.56\n52%\n6.28\n80%\n3.28\n33\n14.12\n386\n17.00\n57\n17.53\n5.44\n2.83\n59%\n7.43\n83%\n6.75\n26\n24.48\n397\n23.62\n56\n19.18\n\n3\n11.90\n1.37\n55%\n6.37\n88%\n1.88\n111\n21.35\n430\n12.72\n80\n22.55\n9.58\n2.89\n62%\n8.22\n91%\n5.29\n93\n43.26\n456\n39.18\n85\n27.73\n\nTable 1 Result of Sensitivity Analysis Experiment\n\n4\n15.10\n0.96\n57%\n7.08\n91%\n1.19\n249\n26.28\n445\n13.14\n86\n24.02\n12.97\n2.55\n68%\n11.00\n97%\n3.28\n229\n63.92\n486\n58.46\n88\n38.32\n\n5\n16.14\n0.44\n59%\n6.31\n93%\n1.24\n446\n28.82\n451\n12.42\n93\n20.80\n13.96\n1.98\n69%\n10.54\n98%\n1.62\n412\n79.71\n514\n74.57\n95\n57.86\n\n\f20\n\nStaff serving\nutilisation (%)\n\nCustomer waiting\ntime (minute)\n\nProceedings of the Operational Research Society Simulation Workshop 2010 (SW10)'\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\nArrival 1\n\nArrival 2\n+30%\n\nArrival 3\n+30%\n\nArrival 4\n+30%\n\nArrival 5\n+30%\n\nNum ber of custom er arrival\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nArrival 1\n\nNumber of\nservice time\nchange\n\nCabin utilisation\n(%)\n\n150\n\n50\n0\nArrival 3\n+30%\n\nArrival 4\n+30%\n\nDEM\n\nNumber of\ncustomers served\n\nNumber customer\nnot served\n\n500\n\n200\n100\n0\nArrival 3\n+30%\n\nArrival 4\n+30%\n\nArrival 5\n+30%\n\nNumber of customer arrival\n\nDEM/ ABM\n\nArrival 2\n+30%\n\nArrival 3\n+30%\n\nArrival 4\n+30%\n\nArrival 5\n+30%\nDEM\nDEM/ ABM\n\nd: Results for number of service change\n\n400\n300\n\nArrival 2\n+30%\n\nDEM\n\nNumber of custom er arrival\n\nDEM/ ABM\n\nc: Results for cubicle utilisation\n\nArrival 1\n\nArrival 5\n+30%\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\nArrival 1\n\nArrival 5\n+30%\n\nNum ber of custom er arrival\n\nArrival 4\n+30%\n\nb: Results for staff utilisation\n\n100\n\nArrival 2\n+30%\n\nArrival 3\n+30%\n\nNum ber of custom er arrival\n\nDEM/ ABM\n\na: Results for customer waiting time\n\nArrival 1\n\nArrival 2\n+30%\n\nDEM\n\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\nArrival 1\n\nDEM\n\nArrival 3\n+30%\n\nArrival 4\n+30%\n\nArrival 5\n+30%\n\nNum ber of custom er arrival\n\nDEM/ ABM\n\ne: Results for number of customer not served\n\nArrival 2\n+30%\n\nDEM\nDEM/ ABM\n\nf: Results for number of customer served\n\nFigure 7 Results of Experiment 1 - 8 fitting room cubicles\nHence, we conclude that the sensitivity analysis\nhas proven that staff's proactive behaviour has\nsignificant impact on both simulation models.\nHowever, the observation has also discovered\nthat the impact on the output performance of the\nDES/ABS model is slightly higher than DES\nmodel. We will investigate this further in the\nfuture.\n4.4 Comparing the Impact of Reactive and\nMixed Reactive and Proactive Behaviour\nIn a previous experiment (Majid et al, 2009),\nnamely Experiment A, we modelled exclusively\nthe reactive behaviour of sales staff towards a\ncustomer using DES and DES/ABS. As to\nimprove the model, the first experiment in this\npaper (see Section 4.3), namely Experiment B,\nwe modelled a mix of reactive and proactive\nbehaviour of sales staff towards a customer. This\ntime, we aimed to make statistical comparison of\nthe difference between modelling reactive\n\nbehaviour and the mixed of reactive and proactive\nbehaviours involved in our simulation models. This\ncomparison is vital to determine the similarities and\ndissimilarities of both models in the output\nperformance.\nWe considered similar scenarios for both\nexperiments: We had one staff member that\nperformed three tasks ((1) counting garments on\nentry, (2) providing help, and (3) counting garments\non exit), we set a fixed number of customers arriving\nper day (300) and we fixed number of fitting room\ncubicles (8). We added another proactive feature\nwhich was the demand driven change in service time.\nWe selected customer waiting time and staff\nutilisation as performance measures for our statistical\ncomparison. Our hypotheses are as below:\n\uf0b7\n\nHo1 = The average customer waiting times\nresulted from our DES model are not\n\n\fProceedings of the Operational Research Society Simulation Workshop 2010 (SW10)'\nsignificantly different in Experiment A\nand B.\nHo2 = The average customer waiting\ntimes resulted from our DES/ABS\nmodel are not significantly different in\nExperiment A and B.\nHo3 = The staff utilisation values\nresulted from our DES model are not\nsignificantly different in Experiment A\nand B.\nHo4 = The staff utilisation values\nresulted from our DES/ABS model are\nnot significantly different in Experiment\nA and B.\n\naverage customer waiting times and staff utilisation in\nExperiment A and Experiment B for both DES and\nDES/ABS models. This implies that proactive\nbehaviour can help a staff to reduce the servicing time\nand providing a bigger impact on reducing the staff\nutilisation. However, being proactive by reducing the\nservicing time only shows limited impact on customer\nwaiting times in both simulation models. This is\nbecause the number of fitting room cubicles is a\nfurther bottleneck. We will investigate this issue\nfurther by adding another proactive behaviour which;\nthe staff asks another staff for help when she meets\ncertain condition. We expect that this time we can see\ndifferences in customer waiting times.\n\nAs our data was not normally distributed, the\nmean and median values would be different.\nHence, in order to compare the median values we\nchose the non parametric Mann-Whitney\nstatistical test. This method helped to confirm or\ndisconfirm the above hypotheses. For performing\nthe Mann-Whitney test, we applied the open\nsource statistical software package R (The R\nFoundation for Statistic Computing, 2009). The\nmedian of both performance measures in DES for\nboth reactive and proactive experiment were\ncalculated for this test. The similar procedure was\ndone for the DES/ABS. We chose 0.05 as our\nsignificance level. A test result (p-value) higher\nthan 0.05 would allow us to accept a null\nhypothesis; otherwise we would have to reject it.\nTesting our DES model results on customer\nwaiting times and staff utilisation for Experiment\nA against Experiment B revealed a p-value of\n0.1608 and 0.000 respectively. Since the DES pvalue for waiting times was greater than our\nchosen significance level (0.05) we failed to\nreject our Ho1 hypothesis. In contrast, we have to\nreject Ho3 hypothesis as the DES p-value is lower\nthan our chosen significance level (0.05).\n\nAs an overall conclusion of our reactive compared to\nmixed reactive and proactive experiments, we found\nthat there are no differences between the DES and\nDES/ABS models' output performance when\nmodelling similar human behaviour.\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\nTesting our DES/ABS model results on customer\nwaiting times and staff utilisation for Experiment\nA against Experiment B reveals a p-value of 0.06\nand 0.000 respectively. In similar case with DES\nmodel results, we failed to reject our Ho2\nhypothesis for waiting times as the DES/ABS pvalue was higher than our chosen level of\nsignificance (0.05). Meanwhile, for staff\nutilisation, the DES/ABS p-value was lower than\nour chosen significance level (0.05) which Ho4\nhypothesis had to be rejected.\nOn the basis of our statistical results on the\nmeasures of central tendency, it can be concluded\nthat there was significant difference between the\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\n\nThis paper has presented simulation as a tool to\ninvestigate the impact of human reactive and\nproactive service behaviour in the retail sector. As a\nmatter of fact, we were more interested in finding out\nthe benefits of implementing one behaviour or the\nother. Our investigations focused on determining the\nadvantages and disadvantages of implementing the\nreactive and proactive service behaviour in a\nsimulation model.\nWe dealt with the reactive service behaviour in an\nearlier paper (Majid et al 2009) and in this paper we\nfocused on the proactive service behaviour. In order\nto understand the impact of implementing the\nproactive service behaviour to the real system, we\nmodelled the behaviour for DES and DES/ABS.\nProactive service behaviour relates to a staff making\nan autonomous decision in handling an uncontrolled\nsituation in the fitting room (in our case reducing the\nservice times and consequently reduce customer\nwaiting times). In order to gain a valid proactive\nmodel, we conducted the sensitivity analysis where\nwe firstly varied the number of customer arrivals and\nsecondly the number of fitting cubicles. The analysis\ndiscovered that the proactive staff behaviour has\naffected both; the performance measures of the DES\nmodel as well as the performance measures of the\nDES/ABS model. However, the study found that the\nimpact on the DES/ABS model was much noticeable.\nWe then compared our simulation results from the\nsensitivity analysis (proactive behaviour) with results\nfrom an experiment (reactive behaviour) that we\nconducted in previous paper (Majid et al 2009). It has\n\n\fProceedings of the Operational Research Society Simulation Workshop 2010 (SW10)'\nbeen discovered that there was not significant\ndifference in the customer waiting times output\nresulted from DES and DES/ABS model when\nconsidering either reactive or mixed reactive and\nproactive service behaviour. Nonetheless, the\ndifference was significant in the performance\noutput of staff utilisation in the DES and\nDES/ABS models. This demonstrates that both\nsimulations approaches show similarities in\nmodelling and simulating the similar human\nbehaviour.\nIn future, we will investigate further about the\ndifferences of results that we found in the\nsensitivity analysis experiment between DES and\nDES/ABS models. In addition, we would like to\ninclude other forms of proactive staff behaviour\nin our simulation models. We are also planning to\nstart with our second case study soon; this time in\npublic sector, to examine if we can generalise our\nfindings regarding the usefulness of combined\nDES/ABS in investigating the behaviour of\nhuman centric complex systems.\nREFERENCES\nBorshchev, A. and A.
