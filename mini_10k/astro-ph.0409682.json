We conclude that the majority of massive galaxies were either assembled\nrelatively late in this redshift interval or were substantially obscured by dust at these redshifts.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nA very wide range of possible evolutionary histories appear consistent with the observed properties of the present-day population\nof galaxies. The simplest and most conservative assumption may\nbe that most galaxies were assembled at some early time and their\ndiffering stellar populations reflect differing subsequent star formation histories. Massive galaxies \u2013 big ellipticals, S0's and early-type\nspirals \u2013 appear to be dominated by old stellar populations, so their\nstar formation rates (SFR) must have been high at early times and\nmust thereafter have declined steeply. Many less massive galaxies\n\u2013 late-type spirals and irregulars \u2013 show evidence for substantial\nrecent star formation, so their SFR's may have varied much less.\nThe light of some is clearly dominated by stars from a recent burst.\nIn order to model recent evolution of the galaxy population in\nsuch a scenario one can adopt the backwards-in-time technique first\nintroduced by Tinsley (see Tinsley 1980). This requires three main\ningredients: the present-day luminosity function (LF) of galaxies\ndivided by morphological type (or better by colour); a parametrisation of the mean star formation history (SFH) for each type (or\ncolour class); and a global cosmological model to relate times, distances and redshifts. The SFH is fed into stellar population synthesis models which determine how the luminosities and colours of\neach type evolve with time. These can then be combined with the\ncosmological model to predict counts of galaxies as a function of\napparent magnitude, observed colour and redshift.\nKauffmann & Charlot (1998, KC98 hereafter) compared\navailable data to the redshift distribution predicted for complete\nK-band-limited galaxy samples by such pure luminosity evolu-\n\ntion (PLE) models assuming an Einstein\u2013de Sitter cosmology. They\nfound the models to overpredict counts at redshifts z > 1 by a large\nfactor. Since then a number of similar studies have updated the cosmological model to the current concordance cosmology and have\npresented new observational samples which cover wider areas or go\nsignificantly deeper. While the improved observations have significantly reduced the statistical uncertainties, they have not substantially changed the redshift distributions from those used by KC98.\nThe change to \u039bCDM significantly reduced the discrepancy, however, by bringing down the number of high redshift objects predicted at a given K magnitude.\nFontana et al. (1999) published a study based on photometric\nredshifts for a K 6 21 sample of 319 galaxies in several small\nfields. Despite using a \u039bCDM model their conclusion agreed with\nKC98; the observed redshift distribution disagreed with their PLE\nmodel. Rudnick et al. (2001) found the same result when comparing a range of published PLE models with their photometric redshifts for 95 Ks,AB 6 22 galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field South.\nIn part II of a series of papers on the Las Campanas Infrared (LCIR)\nSurvey Firth et al. (2002) present photometric redshifts for 3177\ngalaxies down to H 6 20. They compare these to a number of\ndifferent PLE models and again find the abundance of high redshift\nobjects to be overpredicted. All these studies echoed the KC98 conclusion that the data suggest that many present-day massive galaxies were assembled at relatively low redshift.\nOther recent work based on similar data disagrees with this\nconclusion. Kashikawa et al. (2003) and Cimatti et al. (2002b) both\ncompare to a modified \"PLE\" model by Totani et al. (2001) which\nincorporates dust and high-z selection effects, as well as a simpli-\n\n\fKitzbichler et al.\n\n2 THE MODELS\nAs mentioned above, traditional PLE models require knowledge of\nthe present-day LF's of galaxies as a function of their colour. For\neach colour class a star formation history (SFH) model is assumed\nwhich reproduces its z = 0 colour, and this SFH is then used to\npredict the LF and the spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies of this class at all earlier times. Combining the different classes,\ngalaxy counts can then be predicted as a function of observed magnitude, colour and redshift in any observed photometric band for\nany assumed cosmological model. In the following we adopt the\ncosmological parameters of the present standard concordance cosmology: \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n\n2.1 From the local LF to the models\nOur PLE models are normalised to the luminosity functions at redshift zLF = 0.1 recently obtained by Blanton et al. (2003) from\nthe data of the SDSS survey (York et al. 2000). For our purposes\nthe great advantages of these data are their high quality, their superb statistical precision and the fact that they are given in colourluminosity space (see Fig. 1). We separate the data distribution into\nfive colour ranges and calculate the parameters (see Table 1) for a\n\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n(g\u2212r)\n\nfied parametrisation of mergers. This model is able to fit the observed redshift distributions because its large assumed dust extinction hides most massive galaxies at redshifts beyond 1.5 or so. In\nthis article we are primarily concerned with traditional PLE models\nin which mergers are neglected and extinction is assumed weak, in\nparticular for massive galaxies after their initial burst of star formation. We will, however, comment briefly on the effects of dust.\nOne of the most recent studies comparing PLE predictions\nto the redshift distributions of K-selected samples is that of\nSomerville et al. (2004) who found that although such models overproduce the counts at high redshift, the discrepancy is quite modest. They took advantage of the newly acquired K20 and GOODS\nsurvey data, which we also use here, together with other recent\nhigh quality survey data, for comparison to our own PLE models. As we will see, our conclusions do not agree with those of\nSomerville et al. (2004) even for similar models.\nIn this letter we investigate a number of traditional PLE models spanning the full plausible range of metallicity, initial mass\nfunction (IMF), and star formation history. The following Section\n2 describes how our models are set up to reproduce the presentday LF's as a function of colour in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) (\u00a72.1) and how various different SFR's and metallicities\nare assigned to the different colour classes (\u00a72.1) in order to follow their luminosity evolution backward in time. We establish the\nrange of allowed parameters and present five models to illustrate\nthe resulting range of evolutionary predictions. We check that our\nmodels reproduce the local K-band LF, as observed by the 2MASS\nsurvey (\u00a72.2) as well as the passive evolution of colour and M/L\nratio observed for cluster elliptical galaxies. In Section 3 we compare the predictions of these models with counts as a function of\nredshift in recent deep K-selected surveys. Finally in the concluding Section 4 we discuss possible interpretations of our primary\nresult, that there are fewer luminous galaxies observed at z & 1.2\nthan are expected on the basis of traditional PLE models. Either a\nlarge amount of dust obscures galaxies at higher redshifts, or many\npresent-day massive galaxies were not yet assembled by z \u223c 2.\n\n0.1\n\n2\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\u221217\n\n\u221218\n\n\u221219\n\n\u221220\n\u221221\nM0.1i\u22125log(h)\n\n\u221222\n\n\u221223\n\nFigure 1.

For each\ngalaxy type the spectrum and the LF can then be evolved backwards\nin time in order to predict the properties of the galaxy population at\nearlier redshifts.\nThe assignment of SFH to present-day colour is far from\nunique, so we construct a variety of possible models differing in\ntheir IMF, metallicity, formation redshift zf (defined as the redshift\nwhen stars start to form) and e-folding timescale \u03c4 for an assumed\nexponentially declining SFR. We assume all colour classes to have\nthe same zf , except for the bluest one, which often cannot be fit\nby any exponentially declining SFR. This is a particular problem\nfor models with a steep IMF. In such cases we assume a SFH with\nconstant SFR seen at a fixed age, implying no evolution with redshift. This is the standard fix for this problem, which is, in any case,\nirrelevant for the questions we study here.\nWe limit the range of allowed parameters in our PLE models by requiring consistency with the observed, apparently passive\nevolution of bright early-type galaxies in clusters. We require the\nB-band mass-to-light ratio of our reddest colour classes to evolve\nsimilarly to the measurements of van Dokkum & Stanford (2003).\nAs the left three panels in Fig. 3 show, this mainly constrains the\nslope of the IMF, given that one has considerable freedom in the\nchoice of the formation redshift zf . IMF's with a power law exponent of x = 2.0 (where the Salpeter exponent is x = 1.35) are\nexcluded, except possibly for the lowest formation redshifts. We\nnevertheless adopt this slope for Model 4 below in order to study\nits implications. We note that most recent work on IMF's at high\nredshift have tended to argue for exponents significantly flatter than\nSalpeter (\"top-heavy IMF's\") in order to explain the high luminosities of sub-millimeter luminous galaxies and the apparently high\naggregate metal yields of early generations of stars.\nWe also require the rest-frame U -B colours of the reddest\ncolour class to match those of bright ellipticals in two clusters,\nthe Coma cluster at z = 0.023 and MS 1054-03 at z = 0.87\n(Gavazzi et al. 1991; van Dokkum et al. 1999). This allows only a\nnarrow range of metallicities for these bright early-types, namely\napproximately solar, as can be seen from the three right-hand panels in Fig. 3 which show the evolution in rest-frame colour for stellar populations of given metallicity formed with a Salpeter IMF in\na single burst at a variety of redshifts. IMF variations have very\nlittle effect on this colour since it is dominated by main sequence\nturn-off stars (as explained by Bruzual & Charlot 2003).\nWe present results for five representative models that are at\nleast marginally consistent with all these constraints. Their parameters are summarised in Table 2 and were selected to cover the whole\nrange of permitted values.\n\nFigure 3. Left: Evolution of the mass-to-light ratio of cluster ellipticals in\nthe B-band as given by van Dokkum & Stanford (2003). Small open symbols denote individual galaxies while big filled symbols stand for data averaged over a number of massive galaxies in a cluster. The model predictions\nare shown for different zf and IMF slopes ranging from x = 1.35 at the\ntop to x = 2 at the bottom. Right: Rest-frame U -B evolution of model\nearly-type galaxies compared to the rest-frame U -B colours of cluster ellipticals at z = 0.87 (MS 1054-03) and at z = 0.023 (Coma). Model\npredictions are shown for different zf and for three metallicities, 0.2Z\u2299 ,\nZ\u2299 and 2.5Z\u2299 from top to bottom.\n\n2.2 The K-band LF as a consistency test\nThe LF's used here were measured in the rest frame 0.1 i-band. We\ncan check the reliability of our stellar population models for the\nfive colour classes by using them to predict the K-band (2.2 \u03bcm)\nluminosity function of local galaxies. This is of particular interest\nbecause near-IR light is a relatively good tracer of stellar mass, depending only weakly on dust content and SFH. We therefore compare the present-day K-band LF produced by our models to the\nobserved function as given by Kochanek et al. (2001). As can be\nseen in Fig. 4, models and data agree reasonably well apart from\na slight magnitude offset, perhaps \u223c 0.15m , at the bright end.\nThis is likely due to the rather bright isophotal magnitudes used by\nKochanek et al. in contrast to the surface-brightness independent\nPetrosian magnitudes of the SDSS survey. The difference is most\npronounced for elliptical galaxies with de Vaucouleur-type surface\nbrightness profiles. These dominate the bright end of the LF.\n\n3 COMPARISON OF K-BAND SELECTED REDSHIFT\nDISTRIBUTIONS\nIn this letter we compare to the same deep surveys as\nSomerville et al. (2004), namely GOODS CDF-S covering\nabout 160 arcmin2 with photometric redshifts obtained by\nMobasher et al. (2004) and K20 carried out in a smaller area of the\nsame field covering 52 arcmin2 but providing spectroscopic redshifts rather than photometric ones (Cimatti et al. 2002a). The differential distribution of galaxies per arcmin2 and per unit redshift\n\n\f4\n\nKitzbichler et al.\n\nFigure 4. Comparison of our model K-band LF's with the one that\nKochanek et al. (2001) derived from 2MASS data. The slight offset at bright\nmagnitudes can be accounted for by differing magnitude definitions in the\nSDSS and 2MASS surveys.\n\nFigure 5.

Cumulative redshift distributions corresponding to the differential\ndistributions of Fig. 5. The inset shows the same distributions normalised to\n1.0 at z = 0 rather than the absolute counts per arcmin2 .\n\ninterval is shown in Fig. 5 for both datasets, binned to \u2206z = 0.15\nand with Poisson errorbars. Clearly there is some substructure in\nthese distributions due to the relatively small fields surveyed. In\nparticular at z \u223c 0.7 there is a prominent peak in the K20 data.\nThis feature is still visible in Fig. 6, the cumulative redshift distribution of galaxies. In a larger comoving volume such fluctuations\nshould average out, which gives the smoother curves obtained for\nthe somewhat larger GOODS survey.\nSuperposed on the observational data in Fig.'s 5 and 6 we show\nthe differential and cumulative redshift distributions predicted by\nthe various models specified in Table 2. In both figures directly predicted counts are given per arcmin2 . In the inset of Fig. 6, however,\nwe additionally show cumulative plots normalised to unity in order\nto show that the predicted redshift distributions differ in shape as\nwell as in amplitude.\nIn order to quantify the obvious discrepancy between observations and models, Table 3 presents expected and measured counts\nintegrated over various redshift ranges. The standard Salpeter\nmodel, model 0, overpredicts the observed counts beyond z = 1\nby a factor of almost 3, beyond z = 1.5 by more than a factor of 5,\nand beyond z = 2 by nearly an order of magnitude.\n\n4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe problem we study in this letter is whether the available observational data are consistent with present day luminous galaxies\nbeing already assembled with the bulk of their stars formed at high\nredshift. If so, it should be possible to find a set of parameters such\nthat traditional PLE models can simultaneously reproduce: (i) the\npresent-day luminosity and colour distributions of massive galaxies; (ii) the passive evolution in colour and M/L ratio observed\nfor massive early-type galaxies in clusters; and (iii) the observed\ngalaxy counts as a function of redshift in deep surveys. Near-IR\nlimited surveys are best suited for this purpose since the observed\nmagnitudes are then a fair indicator of stellar mass and are only\nweakly affected by dust. We therefore chose K-band data from the\nK20 and GOODS CDF-S surveys for comparison with our models.\nOut to redshift z \u223c 1 our model predictions are very similar to each other and also fit the data reasonably, given their error bars. At higher redshifts all models predict too many galaxies.\nOnly Model 4, with x = 2, comes close to the data. Obviously\nthe IMF assumed has the largest impact on the predicted number of galaxies at high redshift; the second and third best models\n\n\fPLE: Missing Bright Galaxies at High Redshift\nare the two with x = 1.5. Changing the formation redshift only\nmildly influences the shape of the distributions at z < 2.5. The\nmore conventional standard Model 0, using a Salpeter IMF, and its\nlow zf pendant, Model 1, produce the predictions most inconsistent\nwith the data. This may be understood by recalling that the light of\nold stellar populations is dominated by stars with masses near the\nmain sequence turn-off. For younger populations this turn-off is at\nhigher masses. Hence a shallower IMF, corresponding to more turnoff stars in younger populations, implies brighter galaxies at early\ntimes, and so more high redshift galaxies above any apparent magnitude limit. The B-band M/L ratio evolution of the brightest and\nreddest galaxies is an important constraint on our models because it\nis also sensitive to the IMF for the same reasons. As already noted\nin Section 2.1 models with x = 2 are inconsistent with observation,\nexcept possibly for very low formation redshifts. Additionally, for\nx = 2 our models cannot fit the observed present-day colours of the\nbluest galaxy classes for constant SFR and zf > 3.5. For the galaxies to be blue enough they would have to be much younger. Missing bright blue stars at the high mass end of the IMF again account\nfor the effect. Finally, since most models for the light output and\nmetal production of high redshift galaxies require IMF's with substantially more high mass stars than Salpeter (e.g. Nagashima et al.\n2004), an IMF as steep as x = 2 appears very unlikely as an explanation of the apparent lack of high redshift massive galaxies.\nOur Model 0 is very similar to the PLE model used by\nSomerville et al. (2004) but whereas we find it to be badly inconsistent with the data, they conclude that any problem is marginal.\nThere are two reasons for this discrepancy. Looking at their Figure 1 there is clearly a problem in going from their differential redshift distribution, which is very similar to our own, to the cumulative distribution, which predicts substantially fewer high redshift\ngalaxies than does ours. In addition, they compare the cumulative\ndistribution to the data after normalising both to unity (as in the\ninset to Fig. 6) which then misses the fact that the total predicted\ngalaxy count at K< 20 is substantially larger than observed.\nAll of our models with x 6 1.5 overpredict the counts at redshifts z > 1 by a large factor as can be seen in Table 3. In the\ninterval 1 < z < 2 these models all predict more than twice the\nnumber of galaxies observed and in the interval 2 < z < 3 they\nare off by factors between 4 and 11. Could cosmic variance or dust\naccount for this? The clustering of galaxies has the greatest effect\nat low redshift, where the observed volume is comparatively small\nand clear evidence of large fluctuations is seen in Fig. 5 at z = 0.7\nin the K20 data. However in this range the models still agree quite\nwell with the data, only at higher redshifts do they deviate. Also\nthe model predictions are obviously systematically too high at all z\nwhich is not what one would expect if the effect was due to cosmic\nvariance. Finally, models and data also disagree in the normalised\nversion of the diagram (inset in Fig. 6).\nExtinction by dust, on the other hand, might indeed be important. As a simple model to assess how much dust is required to\nbring our PLE models into agreement with the data, consider placing a foreground screen in front of all galaxies at z = 1.5, thereby\ntranslating their apparent luminosity function fainter by some fixed\namount. We find that to lower the count for Model 0 in Fig. 5 by the\nfactor of 2.1 needed to bring it into agreement with the GOODS\ndata at this redshift requires 0.7 magnitudes of extinction at observed K (i.e. at rest-frame z). Carrying out a similar calculation at\nz = 2 we find that 1.0 magnitudes of extinction is again required\nat observed K (now rest-frame r) to reduce the abundance of galaxies per unit redshift by the required factor of 5.1. For comparison\nKauffmann et al. (2003) analysed dust attenuation in a sample of\n\n5\n\n122808 low redshift galaxies drawn from the SDSS, finding a typical (median) attenuation of 0.2 \u2013 0.3 magnitudes in the z-band for\nmassive galaxies. We thus need much more dust in high redshift\nmassive galaxies than is seen in local galaxies to reconcile our PLE\nmodels with the data. Note that this dust must be present without\nan accompanying population of younger stars, which would raise\nthe intrinsic luminosity of the stellar population of the galaxy. In\nthe nearby universe such populations are almost always present in\ndusty galaxies and the effects of the young stars cancel almost exactly those of the dust, resulting in a colour\u2013apparent M/L relation\nwhich depends very weakly on dust content (Bell & de Jong 2001;\nKauffmann et al. 2003). If high redshift galaxies behave similarly,\nthen dust will not help reconcile our PLE models with the data.\nOur main conclusion is that traditional PLE models cannot\nreconcile the relatively small number of high redshift galaxies\nfound in deep K-selected redshift surveys with the abundance of\nmassive galaxies seen in the local Universe. The counterparts of\nnearby luminous red galaxies just do not seem to be present in sufficient numbers at redshifts of 1.5 to 2. The areas of the deep surveys\nare quite small, so there may still be significant uncertainties in this\nstatement as a result of cosmic variance. Substantial amounts of\ndust might also cause many distant massive galaxies to be missed,\nbut only if dust attenuation is not compensated by emission from\nyoung stars in the way observed in low redshift galaxies. If these\ntwo possibilities are insufficient to explain the discrepancy, then\none will be forced to conclude that most nearby massive galaxies\nwere assembled at z < 1.5, presumably by mergers of pre-existing\nstellar systems, since their stars appear to be old.\n\nREFERENCES\nBell, E.
