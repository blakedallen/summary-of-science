Introduction\nThe little Higgs models, as an alternative solution of the \"little hierarchy problem\" of the\nStandard Model (SM), revive the idea of the Higgs doublet being a pseudo Goldstone boson\nof some global symmetry which is spontaneously broken at a TeV scale. In the little Higgs\nmodels the SM Higgs is a part of the scalar multiplet(s) of some global symmetry and the SM\nHiggs mass parameter depends logarithmically on the UV cutoff scale of the global symmetry.\nAmong the various little Higgs models, there is the simplest little Higgs model (SLHM) [1, 2]\nbased on a simple SU (3) global symmetry. The study of precision data in the gauge and\nquark sector set constraints on the parameters of the simplest little Higgs model [4, 5].\nThe SLHM contains two distinct features compared with the littlest Higgs model (LHM)\n[6] which is most intensively examined among the little Higgs models. The first feature is\nthat the SLHM has no counter partner(s) to the SM Higgs scalar. The existence of the SM\nHiggs counter partner in the little Higgs models is required to cancel dangerous quadratically\ndivergent contribution to the SM Higgs mass squared paramters coming from the SM Higgs\nloops. In the LHM, the complex SU (2)L triplet scalar play a role of the counter partner to\nthe SM Higgs doublet. However, in the SLHM the absence of the quadratically divergent\ncontribution to the Higgs mass parameter from the Higgs loops is excused by the fact that\nthe SM Higgs is contained in a pair of Higgs multiplets rather than in a Higgs multiplet.\nThe second feature, barely noticed before, is that the SM neutrino in a generation accompanies a neutral vector-like lepton just as the top quark teams up with a heavy vector-like\nquark. The heavy top partners lead to the large Yukawa couplings for the top quark. Unlike\nthe heavy top quark, the SM left-handed neutrinos do not have right-handed pairs. Furthermore, they have extremely small masses, which has been convinced by neutrino flavor\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\foscillation experiments as well as cosmological and astrophysical observations. The standard\nformalism for neutrino oscillations is based on oscillations among the three left-handed neutrinos (\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 )L , which is refered to as first-class oscillations. In the SLHM, the coupling of\nthe SM neutrino to its heavy partner further give rise to transitions between the SM neutrinos\nand their heavy partners, which is dubbed as second-class oscillations [7].\nThe object of this letter is to make a detailed analysis of the second-class oscillations as\nwell as the first-class oscillations within the framework of the SLHM. To do so, we first inspect\nthe origin of the SM neutrino masses which in general arise from Dirac or Majorana mass\nterms in various extensions of the SM. In the SLHM, though right-handed neutral leptons\nare present in the neutral lepton sector they are not Dirac-paired with the SM (left-handed)\nneutrinos. Rather they are Dirac-paired with the partners of the SM neutrinos. Therefore it\nis naively expected that the SM neutrino mass in the SLHM arises only from Majorana mass\nterms. We show that radiative corrections give rise to the Majorana mass terms, leading to\nnot only the SM neutrino masses but also the SM neutrino mixing angles. We further search\nfor other consequences of the scenario at weak energy scale.\nThe rest of the letter is organized as follows: In section 2 we briefly review the Higgs\nsector of the SLHM. In section 3 we discuss the Yukawa couplings of the lepton sector in\none generation case. In section 4 we study the mechanism of the SM neutrino masses in one\ngeneration case. In section 5 we extend the mechanism of the SM neutrino masses to three\ngeneration case and investigate both the first-class and second-class oscillations. In section 6\nwe give a summary and provide an outlook for the neutrino physics within the SLHM.\n\n2. Higgs sector\nThe simplest little Higgs model based on the SU (3) simple global symmetry has the initial\nelectroweak gauge structure SU (3)weak \u00d7 U (1)X which is broken to the SM SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y .\nThe symmetry breaking is triggered by the VEV's of a pair of triplets \u03a61,2 , which transform\nas (3, \u2212 13 ) under the SU (3)weak \u00d7 U (1)X . They are parameterized non-linearly as follows:\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u001a\n\u001b 0\n0\nf2 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03a61 = exp i\u0398\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8 \u2261 exp{i\u0398 cot \u03b2/f } \uf8ed 0 \uf8f8 ,\nf f1\nf1\nf sin \u03b2\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u001b 0\n\u001a\n0\nf1 \uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03a62 = exp \u2212i\u0398\n\uf8ed 0 \uf8f8 \u2261 exp{\u2212i\u0398 tan \u03b2/f } \uf8ed 0 \uf8f8\nf f2\nf2\nf cos \u03b2\n\nwhere f1 \u2261 f sin \u03b2, f2 \u2261 f cos \u03b2, and the \u0398 NGB matrix is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n00\nh\uf8f7\n\u03b7\n\uf8ec\n\u0398 = \u221a + \uf8ed 0 0 \uf8f8.\n2\nh\u2020 0\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n(2.1)\n\n(2.2)\n\n\fHere the field h is an SU (2)L doublet which is identified with the SM Higgs doublet, \u03b7 is a\nreal SU (2)L singlet scalar with no vev. The mass of \u03b7 is assumed to be of the electroweak\nscale and the complete analysis of the physics associated with \u03b7 is given in Ref. [8].\nThere are yet seven degrees of freedom in \u03a61 and \u03a62 but we have omitted them in\nEq. (2.1) by intention. The reason is as follows: five degrees of freedom are eaten by the\ngauge fields during the symmetry breaking of SU (3)weak \u00d7 U (1)X \u2192 SU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y acting\nas the longitudinal components of the broken gauge fields and the rest, two degrees of freedom\nare the massive excitation modes along the two vev's directions with their masses being of\norder f . Thus we can take into account only five pseudo Goldstone bosons, h and \u03b7, below\nthe scale f .\n\n3. One generation case\nWe now take into account the leptonic sector in the SLHM. For simplicity, we consider\nonly the first generation in this section. The SM first leptonic generation is embedded in\nSU (3)weak \u00d7 U (1)X representations as follows:\n1\n\u03a8L = (3, \u2212 )\n3\n\neR = (1, 1)\n\n(3.1)\n\nnR = (1, 0)\nwhere the triplet \u03a8L = (iL, nL )T embraces the left-handed SU (2)L doublet, L = (\u03bdeL , eL )T\nwhile the right-handed SU (3)weak singlets eR and nR are the Dirac partners of eL and nL in\nthe triplet, respectively 1 . Note that the SM neutrino in the triplet has no Dirac partner 2 .\nThe existence of the two triplet scalars allows us to construct the Yukawa couplings,\nyielding mass terms for the fermions in the model. In particular, the mass terms for the SM\ncharged lepton e and neutral lepton n arise from the interactions of the form:\n\u2212Lyuk = \u03bbn nR \u03a6\u20201 \u03a8L +\n\n\u03bbe\neR \u03a6i1 \u03a6j2 \u03a8kL \u01ebijk + h.c.,\nf\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere \u03bbe and \u03bbn are set to be real, which is allowed by redefining phases of nR and eR ,\nrespectively. As in the quark sector, one may also take into account another term like nR \u03a6\u20202 \u03a8L\nwhich is obtained by replacing \u03a6\u20201 by \u03a6\u20202 in the first term of (3.2). However, we need not\ninclude it because it does not change the physics associated with neutrinos which we shall\ndiscuss. To make the physics simple, we ignore the interaction from now on.\nThe second component in the lepton triplet, eL , and the charged singlet, eR , have a Dirac\nmass after the SM Higgs (the first component of \u03a61 ) gets a vev, hhT i = ( \u221av2 , 0):\nv\n\u03bbe\neR \u03a6i1 \u03a6j2 \u03a8kL \u01ebijk + h.c. \u2192 \u2212LDirac = \u03bbe \u221a eR eL + h.c.,\nf\n2\n1\n\n(3.3)\n\nWe shall assert that ncL 6= nR after we introduce the SM neutrino mass.\nThere are two different embeddings of the quarks and leptons in Ref. [1]. Though the quark charges under\nthe 3-3-1 gauge group are different between the two embeddings, the lepton charges are the same in both.\n2\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\f\u221a\nyielding the electron mass, me = \u03bbe v/ 2, as in the SM. On the other hand, a linear combination of \u03bdeL and nL have Dirac masses via the neutral singlet, nR , as the first and third\ncomponents of \u03a61 acquire vevs, h\u03a61 i = (if2 /f hhi, f1 )T , respectively:\nf2 v\n\u03bbn nR \u03a6\u20201 \u03a8L + h.c. \u2192 \u03bbn f1 nR nL + \u03bbn \u221a nR \u03bdeL + h.c.\nf 2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nv\nn\n= \u03bb f nR sin \u03b2nL + \u221a cos \u03b2\u03bdeL + h.c.\nf 2\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe relation of mass eigenstate (\u03bd\u0302eL , n\u0302L ) to weak eigenstate (\u03bdeL , nL ) is given by\nn\u0302L = cos \u03b8nL + sin \u03b8\u03bdeL ,\n\n\u03bd\u0302eL = \u2212 sin \u03b8nL + cos \u03b8\u03bdeL\n\n(3.5)\n\nwith the mixing angle\nsin \u03b8 \u2261 q\n\n\u221av\n2f\n\ncos \u03b2\n\nsin2 \u03b2 +\n\nv2\n2f 2\n\n,\ncos2 \u03b2\n\ncos \u03b8 \u2261 q\n\nsin \u03b2\nsin2 \u03b2 +\n\nv2\n2f 2\n\n.\n\n(3.6)\n\ncos2 \u03b2\n\nNote that the mixing angle is independent of the Yukawa coupling \u03bbn , and vanishes in the\nlimits of either v/f \u2192 0 or \u03b2 \u2192 \u03c0/2 3 .\nThe neutral fields n\u0302L and nR consist of the neutral heavy lepton:\n\u2212LDirac = mn nR n\u0302L + h.c.\nwith a Dirac mass\nmn = \u03bbn f\n\ns\n\nsin2 \u03b2 +\n\nv2\ncos2 \u03b2,\n2f 2\n\n(3.7)\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhich is determined almost by the coupling \u03bbn because the global symmetry breaking parameter f is assumed to be a TeV range in little Higgs models. Experimentally, the neutral\nheavy lepton have a larger mass than the weak gauge bosons, satisfying the neutral heavy\nlepton mass limits [9]. Assuming that the vev parameter is f . 10 TeV we can set a lower\nbound on the coupling, \u03bbn & 10\u22122 .\nFrom Eq. (3.5) we see that second-class oscillations between \u03bdeL and nL can be present\nso that the chance of finding the signature of an neutral heavy lepton is proportional to\nthe mixing angle, sin \u03b8. But due to a large mass of the neutral heavy lepton second-class\noscillations are not present in neutrino experiments. Instead, a way to probe sin \u03b8, is to\nmeasure decays of the neutral heavy lepton via charged currents like n \u2192 W lL or neutral\ncurrents like n \u2192 Z\u03bdL .\nAs for the SM neutrino the Yukawa interactions in Eq. (3.2) leaves the SM neutrino to\nbe massless.

But one should keep in mind that the UV cutoff of little Higgs\nmodels is about 10 \u223c 100 TeV, which implies that the symmetry breaking scale associated\nwith the SM neutrino masses is so low that the seesaw mechanism is of no use. Therefore,\nwe reckon that the SM neutrino masses will stem from another mechanism which yields a\nsufficiently small mass for the neutrino.\n\n4. Mechanism of Majorana masses\nWe now turn to our attention to the origin of the SM neutrino masses in the context of the\nsimplest little Higgs model. One may think of a Dirac mass term as a source of the SM\nneutrino mass due to the presence of the right-handed neutral singlet field, nR . But we have\nalready shown that the right-handed singlet does not contributes to a Dirac mass for the\nSM neutrino. Rather, it becomes the Dirac pair with the heavy neutral partner of the SM\nneutrino. Furthermore, the SM neutrinos in other little Higgs models seems to acquire a\nMajorana mass rather than a Dirac mass [10, 11, 12]. Accordingly tiny SM neutrino masses\nin the simplest little Higgs model are expected to be Majorana, which was first considered\nin Ref. [13]. In what follows we shall further scrutinize the mechanism of the SM neutrino\nmass in Ref. [13]. But for simplicity we consider one generation case in this section and shall\nextend to three generation case in Section 5.\nFirst of all, we add a Majorana mass term\n\u3008 \u03a62 \u3009\n\u3008 \u03a6\u20202 \u3009\nfor SU (3)weak singlet, nR , to the Lagrangian:\n\u2212LMajorana = m\u22c4 nR ncR + h.c.,\n\n\u03a61\n\n(4.1)\n\n\u03a6\u20201\n\nwhose origin is due to a singlet Higgs or a bare\nmass term but is unknown in the context of\nthe simplest little Higgs model. A UV complec\nc\n\u03a8L\nnR\nnR\n\u03a8L\ntion of the model should give an explanation\nfor its presence. We assert a mass hierarchy,\nFigure 1: Diagram for Majorana mass matrix of m\u22c4 \u226a mn , to maintain the vector-like prop\u03a8L .\nerty of heavy neutral leptons in the simplest\nlittle Higgs model. Thus the smallness of m\u22c4 is expected to be achieved by quamtum effects\nin a UV completion of the model.\nNext, we introduce Majorana mass term to SU (2)L singlet nL :\n\u2212LMajorana = m\u2737 ncL nL + h.c.\n\n(4.2)\n\nSince both \u03bdeL and nL belongs to a SU (3)weak triplet, the presence of a Majorana mass term\nfor nL is expected to be accompanied with a Majorana mass term for \u03bdeL :\nc \u03bd\n\u2212LMajorana = m\u03bd \u03bdeL\neL + h.c.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n(4.3)\n\n\f\u03a6\u20202\n\n\u03a62\n\n\u03a61\n\n\u03a6\u20201\n\nFigure 2:\n|\u03a6\u20201 \u03a62 |2\npotential arises from\ngauge loop contributions which give logdivergent contribution\nto the Higgs mass.\n\nThese Majorana mass terms are achieved at loop level by diagrams as shown in Fig. 1 where the vertex-cross at bottom stands for\nMajorana mass for nR while the two vertex-crosses at top represent\nthe vev of \u03a62 . The black square in Fig. 1 represents a coupling involved with a dimension four operator, |\u03a6\u20201 \u03a62 |2 which gives rise to\nthe log-divergent contributions to the Higgs mass at one-loop [14].\nDiagrams in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show how the operator |\u03a6\u20201 \u03a62 |2 is generated at one-loop. The diagram in Fig. 2 generates a operator of the\nform:\ng4\n|\u03a6\u2020 \u03a62 |2 log(\u039b2 /f 2 ),\n(4.4)\n16\u03c0 2 1\nwhere \u039b \u223c 4\u03c0f is a UV cutoff. This diagram contributes to the SM\nHiggs mass term, \u2212f 2 /16\u03c0 2 h\u2020 h, leading to a lower value of the SM\nHiggs mass. Therefore, \"\u03bc\"-term is included to enhance the SM Higgs\nmass parameter:\nL = \u03bc2 \u03a6\u20201 \u03a62 + h.c.\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe diagram in Fig. 3 also contributes to the SM Higgs mass, giving rise to a operator of the\nform:\n\u03bb21 \u03bb22 /16\u03c0 2 |\u03a6\u20201 \u03a62 |2 log(\u039b2 /f 2 ).\n(4.6)\nNote that fermion loop contributions are proportional to the two Yukawa couplings squared\nand the top quark sector has the largest Yukawa couplongs. Thus the leading fermion loop\ncontribution comes from the top sector and all the other quark contributions are safely negligible compared with the top contribution 4 . In what follows, we sum up all the four \u03a6's\ninteractions and rewrite it as the effective operator:\nL = \u03ba|\u03a6\u20201 \u03a62 |2 ,\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhere \u03ba is a dimensionless coupling whose value is of order 10\u22122 .\nIn summary the Majorana masses for the SM neutrino and its heavy partner are generated\nat two-loop level and the corresponding low-energy effective dimension five operator is given\nby\n(\u03bbn )2\n(4.8)\n(\u03a62 \u03a8cL )(\u03a6\u20202 \u03a8L ) + h.c.,\nL5 =\n\u039b\u03bd\nwith\n1\n\u03ba\n\u2248\nm\u22c4 .\n(4.9)\n\u039b\u03bd\n16\u03c0 2 f 2\nAfter substituting the vev of \u03a62 in Eq.

Three generation case\nEnlarging one generation to three we construct the lepton Yukawa couplings in three generations. The general Yukawa couplings for the three generations are given by extending the\ncoupling numbers in Eq. (3.2) to the 3 \u00d7 3 coupling matrices:\n\u2212Lyuk = [\u03bbn ]ab naR \u03a6\u20201 \u03a8bL +\n\n[\u03bbl ]ab\nlaR \u03a6i1 \u03a6j2 \u03a8kbL \u01ebijk + h.c.\nf\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere \u03a8aL = (i\u03bda , ila , na )TL , naR and laR are a left-handed lepton triplet, a right-handed\nneutral singlet and a right-handed charged singlet under SU (3)weak in the a-th generation,\nrespectively. In what follows square bracket represents a 3 \u00d7 3 matix.\nWe first consider mass eigenstates of the charged leptons by diagonalizing the 3 \u00d7 3\nYukawa coupling matrix, [\u03bbl ], which is transformed by two unitary matrices UR and UL :\nU\u2020R [\u03bbl ]UL = diag[\u03bbe , \u03bb\u03bc , \u03bb\u03c4 ].\n\n(5.2)\n\nThe charged lepton fields in weak eigenstate, lL \u2261 (l1 , l2 , l3 )TL and lR \u2261 (l1 , l2 , l3 )R , are\nrelated to the fields in mass eigenstates, l\u0302L and l\u0302R as follows:\nlR = UR l\u0302R ,\n\nlL = UL l\u0302L .\n\n(5.3)\n\nThus we find that the three charged leptons have the Dirac masses as in the SM,\nv\n(me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 ) = \u221a (\u03bbe , \u03bb\u03bc , \u03bb\u03c4 ).\n2\n\n(5.4)\n\nAs for the neutral leptons we consider the first term of the Lagrangian in Eq.

Note that the first three zeros in Mdiag imply massless SM neutrinos while\nthe remaining three pairs of mass eigenvalues give rise to Dirac masses for the three heavy\nneutral leptons. Using Eq.

This allows us to present\nour results in more suggestive form. But it does not affect in any essential way the physics\nwhich we shall draw. With the assumption we can write the 3 \u00d7 3 Majorana mass matrices\nin Eq. (5.15) as follows:\n[\u03bbn ]\u2020 [\u03bbn ] v 2\ncos2 \u03b2,\n\u039b\u03bd\n2\n[\u03bbn ]\u2020 [\u03bbn ] 2 2\nf sin \u03b2,\n[m\u2737 ] \u2248\n\u039b\u03bd\n[\u03bbn ]\u2020 [\u03bbn ] vf\n\u221a sin 2\u03b2.\n[m\u0302] = [m\u0302]\u2020 \u2248 \u2212\n\u039b\u03bd\n2 2\n\n(5.16)\n\n[m\u03bd ] \u2248\n\n(5.17)\n(5.18)\n\nNote that all the three matrices are proportional to [\u03bbn ]\u2020 [\u03bbn ] but differ only in vev's. Now\nthe full 9 \u00d7 9 mass matrix is given by MD + MM . Comparing with MD , we observe that the\nelements in MM are much smaller than those in MD , so that the perturbation theory can be\napplied to approximately compute the nonzero SM neutrino masses. Accordingly MD and\nMM act as the unperturbed and perturbed mass matrix in the perturbation theory, respectively.\nHowever, since there still remain threefold degenerate zero eigenvalues, we in particular use\nthe perturbation method for the degenerate case.\nLet us carry out the perturbation for the degenerate case. First of all, we need to find\nthe projection operator P0 onto the three SM neutrino states among the nine neutral lepton\nstates. From Eq. (5.10), P0 is given by\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\ncos2 \u03b8[1]\n\u2212 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8[1] [0]\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nP0 = \uf8ed \u2212 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8[1]\nsin2 \u03b8[1]\n[0] \uf8f8 .\n[0]\n[0]\n[0]\n\n(5.19)\n\nAs a result, the mass eigenvalues of the SM neutrinos to the first order are just the nonzero\nroots of the characteristic equation in variable \u2206,\ndet[P0 MM P0 \u2212 \u2206I ] = 0,\n\n(5.20)\n\nwhere I is the identity matrix. From Eqs. (5.16), (5.17) and (5.18), the nonzero roots of the\ncharacteristic equation are\n\u2206i = m\u03bdi =\n\nv 2 sin2 2\u03b2\n(\u03bbni )2\n2\u039b\u03bd sin2 \u03b2 + v22 cos2 \u03b2\n\nwith\n\ni = 1, 2, 3,\n\n(5.21)\n\n2f\n\nwhich are the SM neutrino masses to the first order. Remind that the neutrino are massless\nto the zeroth order in the perturbation theory. In addition, the characteristic equation gives\nthe mixing angles for the SM neutrinos to the zeroth order\n\u03bd\u0302L = VL (cos \u03b8\u03bdL \u2212 sin \u03b8nL ).\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(5.22)\n\n\fFrom Eq. (5.21), it is straightforward to see that the SM neutrino masses are proportional\nto (\u03bbni )2 , yielding a mass relation between the SM neutrinos and heavy neutral leptons as\nfollows:\nm\u03bd1 : m\u03bd2 : m\u03bd3 \u2248 m2n1 : m2n2 : m2n3 .\n\n(5.23)\n\nThis implies that the neutrino mass hierarchy is revealed by the heavy neutral lepton mass\nhierarchy. Therefore, measuring of the heavy neutral lepton masses at the International Linear\nCollider (ILC) can tell the neutrino mass hierarchy that is to be disclosed at the neutrino\nexperiments in the near future.\nUsing Eq. (5.13) and (5.22), we can construct a full 9 \u00d7 9 unitary leptonic mixing matrix\nto the zeroth order\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\nsin \u03b8[1] \u221a12 VL\nsin \u03b8[1]\nVL\ncos \u03b8[1] \u2212 \u221a12 VL\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\u2020\n\uf8f7\n\u221a1\n\u221a1\n(5.24)\nW0 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed \u2212VL sin \u03b8[1] \u2212 2 VL cos \u03b8[1] 2 VL cos \u03b8[1] \uf8f8 .\n\u2020\n\u2020\n1\n1\n\u221a V [1]\n\u221a V [1]\n[0]\n2 R\n2 R\nThus the weak eigenstates of the neutral leptons are given by the linear combinations of the\nmass eigenstates\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03bd\u0302L\n\u03bdL\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n(5.25)\n\uf8ed nL \uf8f8 = W0 \uf8ed n\u0302L \uf8f8 .\nn\u0302cR\nncR\n\nFrom Eq. (5.24), the MNS mixing matrix is given as\n\n\u2020\nUM N S = cos \u03b8VL\n,\n\n(5.26)\n\nwhich is obviously not unitary due to cos \u03b8 6= 1. Furthermore, neutrino-heavy neutral lepton\n\u2020\nwhich is obviously not small. Does it conflict with the experimental\nmixing angles are sin \u03b8VL\ndata on the neutrino oscillations? It is not. In fact, we can not extract the value of cos \u03b8\nfrom the neutrino oscillation experiments. Due to the tremendous mass difference between\nthe SM neutrinos and the heavy neutral leptons, such a mixing yields heavy neutral lepton\ndecays rather than neutrino-heavy neutral lepton oscillations.\nOne can further take into account leptonic weak charged currents so as to extract the\nvalue of cos \u03b8. But the mixing angles in the quark sector exhibit the same patterns because\nthe Yukawa couplings in the quark sector are of the same form as those in the lepton sector.\nThus we can not see the presence of cos \u03b8 in leptonic weak decays associated with the SM\nneutrinos by comparing leptonic charged weak currents with quark charged weak currents,\ni.e. in the weak coupling ratio, (ud \u2192 e\u03bde ) /(\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 e\u03bde ), cos \u03b8 cancels out.\nFinally, we can extract the angle cos \u03b8 (or sin \u03b8) from study of the heavy neutral lepton\n\u2020\ndecays. Classifying various decay modes of the heavy neutral leptons we also find VL\n. With\nthese results, one can confirm the MNS mixing matrix that is obtained at the neutrino\noscillations.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\f6. Summary and outlook\nWe have analyzed the lepton sector in the simplest little Higgs model which contains vectorlike neutral leptons as heavy partners to the SM neutrinos. We emphasize that a naive\nconstruction of the neutral lepton sector at tree level yield a large Dirac mass to the heavy\nneutral leptons but no masses to the SM neutrinos. We have shown that one loop diagrams\ninvolved with two Higgs triplets yield small Majorana masses for the neutral leptons including\nthe SM neutrinos, leading to not only neutrino flavor mixing but also neutrino-heavy neutral\nlepton mixing.\nWe have evaluated a 9 \u00d7 9 mixing matrix of the neutral leptons and the SM neutrino\nmasses by the standards of perturbation theory. The ratio of the Majorana masses associated\nwith the neutral leptons to the Dirac masses is so small that the higher order terms of\nthe perturbation theory can be negligible. We therefore feel that our computations, though a\nrough approximation, does not change the outcomes that we have drawn. We can acknowledge\nthat the heavy neutral leptons are directly associated with the SM neutrinos in the simplest\nlittle Higgs model and thus the study of the heavy neutral leptons catches a glimpse of the SM\nneutrinos and vice versa. For example, the mass hierarchy of the heavy neutral leptons, once\nrevealed at the ILC, will back up that of SM neutrinos which will be found at the neutrino\noscillation experiments in the near future. Inversely, using the currently known data on the\nneutrinos one can predict or restrict the properties of heavy neutral leptons.\nThere are many paths for future research on the neutrinos in the simplest little Higgs\nmodel. One can further investigate phenomena associated with the neutral lepton mixing,\nsuch as the various decay modes of the heavy neutral leptons. One can boldly explore the\norigin of Majorana mass for the SU (3)weak singlet in a UV completion of the simplest little\nHiggs model. Finally, with the help of our scenario one can investigate the neutrinos in other\nlittle Higgs models which embrace heavy neutral leptons, such as different simple little Higgs\nmodel based on a larger simple group.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to Ann Nelson for instructive comments, in particular, recommending me to\nuse the perturbation theory for computation of the mixing matrix.
