We find conditions on the curvature for the evolution to be a\n'collapse process' in the sense of Brody and Hughston [2] or, more\ngenerally, a 'reduction process', and give examples that satisfy these\nconditions. For some of these examples, we show that the L\u00fcders projection postulate admits a consistent interpretation and remains valid\nin the nonlinear regime.\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn reference [8], in the context of a geometrical description of quantum mechanics, the first author investigated a generalisation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation called the stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger evolution. This evolution is governed\nby a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for a random process with values\nin the state-manifold CPn , the space of one-dimensional subspaces of the\nusual linear space of states Cn+1 . The evolution requires for its definition\nvarious specific differential-geometric features of the state-manifold including\nits standard K\u00e4hler metric, the Fubini-Study metric.\nIn reference [2] Brody and Hughston generalised this extended quantum dynamics by defining the stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger evolution (hereafter\nthe SSE) in the case where the state space of the quantum system is given\nby a general K\u00e4hler manifold M. In this theory observables are defined by\nholomorphic Killing vectors on M, that is to say vector fields that preserve\nthe complex structure J as well as the metric g. Such a Killing vector determines a Hamiltonian function, up to an additive constant. One of these\nHamiltonian functions is then taken to be the Hamiltonian H that determines\nthe SSE.\nThe SSE is an SDE on M with the property that its drift reduces the\ndispersion V of H and its volatility is in the direction of the gradient vector\nfield \u2207a H. In particular, the stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger evolution is defined in\nsuch a way that the random process for H is a martingale. Then it turns out\nthat V is a supermartingale, or equivalently that the evolution reduces the\nexpectation of V , if a certain holomorphic sectional curvature KH is positive.\nIf KH > 0, then the expectation of V is reduced to zero asymptotically in\nthe limit of large time, and Brody and Hughston [2] call the corresponding\nevolution on the state manifold M a 'collapse process' for the observable\nH. If F is another observable, in the sense of being the Hamiltonian for\nanother holomorphic Killing vector, which has zero Poisson bracket with\nH then the evolution reduces the expectation of the dispersion V F of F if\na certain holomorphic bisectional curvature is positive (these terms will be\ndefined below). Refining the terminology of [2], we shall call this a 'reduction\nprocess' for F which will be called a 'collapse process' if the expectation of\nV F is reduced to zero asymptotically in time.\nThe Fubini-Study metric on CPn has positive holomorphic bisectional\ncurvature. It follows that the SSE on CPn is a collapse process for any\nchoice of holomorphic Killing vector, with Hamiltonian H say, and that this\n2\n\n\fis simultaneously a reduction process for any other observable commuting\nwith H. It is natural to consider other K\u00e4hler manifolds, beginning with\nlow dimensional or otherwise familiar cases, to seek further examples of state\nmanifolds admitting collapse and reduction processes, and that is the purpose\nof this article. We also consider the L\u00fcders postulate, described in the next\nparagraph, which is known to be a theorem for the SSE in CPn (see [1]), to\nsee if it can be interpreted in these examples, and, if so, if it still holds.\nThe L\u00fcders postulate in standard quantum mechanics covers the situation\nwhen a wave function is a linear combination of eigenstates of a Hamiltonian,\nat least one of which corresponds to a degenerate eigenvalue. Suppose for\nsimplicity that we have a finite-dimensional state space and an initial wavefunction \u03c8(0) = a1 \u03c81 + a2 \u03c82 , where \u03c81 lies in a one-dimensional eigenspace,\nU say, which therefore defines a point of the state-manifold CPn , while \u03c82\nlies in a two-dimensional subspace, W say,which therefore defines a complex\nprojective line in the state manifold. The L\u00fcders postulate ([10]) is that the\nmeasurement process collapses \u03c8 to \u03c81 with probability |a1 |2 or to \u03c82 with\nprobability |a2 |2 despite the fact that states orthogonal\n\u221a to \u03c82 have the same\nenergy as it. Thus one could write \u03c82 = (\u03c83 + \u03c84 )/ 2 say where \u03c83 and \u03c84\nwere orthogonal vectors in W . Now \u03c83 appears in the orthogonal expansion\nof \u03c8(0) but there is zero probability of collapse to it. In the SSE on CPn , the\nevolution is confined to the projective line through \u03c8(0) and \u03c81 and so can\nonly terminate at one of \u03c81 and \u03c82 ; thus the L\u00fcders postulate is a theorem\nin this case. If this is to be true in other state-manifolds, then we shall need\nto identify some geometrical objects equivalent to these various structures,\nin particular the submanifold to which the evolution is confined.\nThe plan of the article is as follows. In Section 2, we shall review the relevant background material on stochastic reduction on K\u00e4hler manifolds that\nappeared in [8] and [2]. In Section 3, we consider one-dimensional K\u00e4hler\nmanifolds, that is to say, manifolds of two real dimensions. Here the requirement that the SSE determines a collapse process is strong enough to restrict\nthe geometry quite severely: the metric is determined by a single function\nof one variable satisfying a convexity condition. In Section 4, we consider\nthe two-dimensional case. Here there is room for several observables, in that\none can have several commuting Killing vectors. A particularly interesting\ncase is that of metrics with U(2) symmetry transitive on hypersurfaces, or of\nLRS Bianchi-type IX in the language of general relativity. This case includes\nsome familiar K\u00e4hler metrics, for example the Eguchi-Hansen metric [3] and\nsome metrics of Hitchin [6]. In Section 5, we generalise some of the examples\n3\n\n\fof Section 4 to find K\u00e4hler metrics with U(N) symmetry admitting collapse\nprocesses with many observables.\n\n2\n\nStochastic reduction on K\u00e4hler manifolds\n\nIn this section, we shall review the ideas of references [2] and [8]. As we have\nsaid, the stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger evolution (or SSE) defined in these references\nis an SDE for a random process with values in a K\u00e4hler manifold M. The\nidea that the state space of quantum theory can be generalised to a K\u00e4hler\nmanifold with symmetries was introduced by Kibble [9], and has since been\ndeveloped further by a number of authors (see, e.g., the references cited in\n[2] and [7]). Suppose that the manifold M has metric g, complex structure\nJ and K\u00e4hler form \u03c9. The evolution requires for its definition a holomorphic\nKilling vector T . The Killing property of T is\nLT g = 0\nand the holomorphic property is\nLT \u03c9 = 0.\n\n(1)\n\niT \u03c9 = dH\n\n(2)\n\nIt follows from (2) that\nfor some function H, which is by definition the Hamiltonian function associated with the Killing vector T . In the quantum mechanical interpretation,\nH is an observable and its dispersion V is defined as\nV = g ab \u2207a H\u2207b H.\n\n(3)\n\nIn the case of the Fubini-Study manifold it can be shown that V is the\nfamiliar squared uncertainty of H in the state corresponding to the given\npoint of M. The SSE of [2] and [8] is given by\n1\ndxat = (2\u03c9 ab\u2207b H \u2212 \u03c3 2 \u2207a V )dt + \u03c3\u2207a HdWt ,\n4\n\n(4)\n\nwhere xat represents a random variable labelled by t and taking values in\nM, dxat is a covariant Ito differential and \u03c3 is a constant. The SDE (4) is\n4\n\n\fdefined with reference to a fixed probability space and filtration, with respect\nto which Wt is a standard Brownian motion. We note in particular that (4)\nis covariant; in fact, the indices are abstract [8], and it reduces to the usual\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation when \u03c3 vanishes. If \u03c3 does not vanish then the SDE\n(4) has the property that it reduces the expected value of the dispersion V ,\nas we shall see. The argument is as follows. First, an application of Ito's\nlemma shows that the random process Ht = H(xt ) is a martingale:\ndHt = \u03c3Vt dWt .\nwhere Vt = V (xt ). From (4), Hughston and Brody [2] derive an equation for\nVt given by\ndVt = \u2212\u03c3 2 KH Vt2 dt + \u03c3\u2207a H\u2207a V dWt ,\n(5)\nwhere KH is a particular holomorphic sectional curvature, namely\nKH =\n\n1\nRapcq J pb J qd \u2207a H\u2207b H\u2207c H\u2207d H.\nV2\n\n(6)\n\nNow if KH is strictly positive , then the SSE (4) leads via (5) to a supermartingale condition on Vt , so that the expectation of Vt decreases. In this\ncase it can be shown that the evolution reduces the expectation of Vt to zero\n(in the limit as t \u2192 \u221e) and halts at a critical point of H or equivalently at\na fixed point of T . Following Brody and Hughston [2] we shall therefore call\nthis a collapse process.\nNext suppose that F denotes another observable. Suppose, in other\nwords, that there is another holomorphic Killing vector X with Hamiltonian function F . We say that F and H commute iff their Poisson bracket\nvanishes, that is to say if and only if\n\u03c9 ab \u2207a F \u2207b H = 0,\nfrom which it follows that the corresponding Killing vectors X and T commute ([2]). In this case, one can ask whether a collapse process for H necessarily also reduces or even collapses F . In particular, suppose we now\nwrite\nV F = g ab \u2207a F \u2207b F\nfor the dispersion of F , and V H for the dispersion of H given in (3). Then\nfor the process V F one finds the SDE\ndVtF = \u2212\u03c3 2 KF H VtF VtH dt + \u03c3\u2207a H\u2207a V F dWt ,\n5\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhere KF H is the biholomorphic sectional curvature given by\nKF H =\n\n1\nV\n\nFV H\n\nRapcq J pb J qd \u2207a H\u2207b H\u2207c F \u2207d F.\n\n(8)\n\nIf this biholomorphic sectional curvature is positive then the SSE, via (7),\nnecessarily reduces the expectation of the dispersion of F . We shall call\nthis a reduction process for F . If we have a collapse process for H that is\nsimultaneously a reduction process for F but is also such that the expectation\nof V F tends to zero asymptotically, we shall call this a collapse process for\nthe observable F . In the terminology of random processes, we have assumed\nthat V H is a supermartingale, and we have deduced that it is then necessarily\na potential ([1], [11]). To have simultaneously a reduction process for F , V F\nmust be a supermartingale, while to have a collapse process for F , V F must\nalso be a potential.\nA process that simultaneously collapses H and F must terminate at a\npoint that is a critical point of both H and F . A process that collapses H\nbut merely reduces F must terminate at a degenerate critical point of H. It\nis possible, even in the case of CP2 with the Fubini-Study metric, to have\na process that collapses H and reduces but does not collapse F . To see\nthis one can take an observable H with a one-dimensional eigenspace, which\ndefines a point, say U1 , in CP2 , and a two-dimensional eigenspace, which\ncomes from a degenerate eigenvalue and defines a complex projective line,\nsay W , in CP2 . Now suppose F is an observable that commutes with H\nbut has nondegenerate eigenvalues. Recall that an eigenvector of F thought\nof as a GL(3, C) matrix that corresponds to a nondegenerate eigenvalue is\nnecessarily an eigenvector of H (since F and H commute by assumption).\nThus the eigenspaces of F will define points U2 and U3 on W , together with\nU1 . Now the SSE will evolve an initial state that is not on either of the\ncomplex projective lines joining U1 to U2 and U1 to U3 either to U1 or to a\npoint in W that does not correspond to an eigenvector of F and so is not a\ncritical point of F . This is a collapse of H and a reduction but not a collapse\nof F . We shall see in Case 1 of Section 4 that this phenomenon can continue\nto occur in the new examples of state-manifolds explored below.\nIn the following sections, we shall be interested in K\u00e4hler manifolds of low\ndimension with enough holomorphic Killing vectors to give interesting sets\nof observables, and with conditions of positivity on the curvature sufficient\nto lead to collapse and reduction processes.\n6\n\n\f3\n\nReduction processes on one-dimensional state\nmanifolds\n\nAny Riemannian manifold of two real dimensions defines a K\u00e4hler manifold\nof one complex dimension. Here there is only one independent component of\ncurvature, namely the Gauss curvature. To have a collapse process this must\nbe positive. It is a theorem of Cohn-Vossen (for references see [5]) that a\ncomplete Riemann surface with positive Gauss curvature is diffeomorphic to\na sphere or a plane. If we assume, as seems reasonable, that a state manifold\nmust be complete, then the state manifold for a collapse process is necessarily\none of these two.\nTo define the SSE we need a holomorphic Killing vector, which in the\ncase of a one-dimensional state manifold is any Killing vector. This could\nhave open or closed trajectories on the plane but on the sphere must have\nclosed trajectories. In either case the metric can be written in the form\nds2 = d\u03b82 + (S(\u03b8))2 d\u03c62\n\n(9)\n\nin terms of a function S(\u03b8), where the Killing vector is T = \u2202/\u2202\u03c6. For this\nmetric we calculate the Gauss curvature and obtain\nK=\u2212\n\n1 d2 S\n.\nS d\u03b82\n\n(10)\n\nFor a collapse process this needs to be positive, and it then follows that S\nmust have a zero. For completeness of the state manifold at a zero of S the\ntrajectories must be closed which makes \u03c6 periodic, and for definiteness we\nassume the period to be 2\u03c0. Also for completeness we need to avoid having a\nconical singularity at any zero of S, which requires dS/d\u03b8 = \u00b11 there. This\nis because, for an infinitesimal circle around the zero, we want the ratio of\ncircumference to radius in the limit of vanishing radius to be 2\u03c0. For a metric\non the plane, S has a single zero; while for a metric on the sphere, S has two\nzeroes. For definiteness, we suppose that the necessary zero of S is at \u03b8 = 0.\nThe K\u00e4hler form associated with the metric (9) is given by\n\u03c9 = S(\u03b8) d\u03b8 \u2227 \u03c6.\nThen as a consequence of (2) the Hamiltonian H(\u03b8) satisfies\ndH\n= \u2212S.\nd\u03b8\n7\n\n(11)\n\n\fIt then follows from (3) that the dispersion V , is given by\nV = S2.\n\n(12)\n\nThe zero or zeroes of S are fixed points of the Killing vector T and critical\npoints of the Hamiltonian H. The SSE will evolve towards such a zero.\nLooking ahead to Section 5, we introduce a holomorphic coordinate tied\nto the symmetry and taking the form z = rei\u03c6 . The K\u00e4hler metric (9)\nnecessarily has a K\u00e4hler potential \u03a3(u) where u = r 2 . In terms of \u03a3 the\nmetric can be written\nds2 = 2\u03a3,z z\u0304 dzdz\u0304,\nand thus\nds2 = 2(\u03a3\u0307 + u\u03a3\u0308)(dr 2 + r 2 d\u03c62 ),\nwhere the dot denotes d/du. Comparing (3) with (9) and (12) we can make\nthe identification\nV = 2u(\u03a3\u0307 + u\u03a3\u0308).\n(13)\nThen as a consequence of (11) and (12) we deduce that H = \u2212u\u03a3\u0307 and\nV = \u22122u\u1e22.\nThe zero of S at \u03b8 = 0 we can suppose to correspond to a zero of V at\nr = 0. It is convenient to introduce a new radial coordinate \u03c7 = log r so that\nthe metric takes the form\nds2 = V (d\u03c72 + d\u03c62 ).\nWith these coordinates, the SSE (4) becomes\n1 d log V\nd\u03c7t = \u2212 \u03c3 2\ndt + \u03c3dWt ,\n2\nd\u03c7\n\nd\u03c6 = 2dt.\n\n(14)\n\nNote that the evolution for \u03c6 is deterministic: this will be important later,\nin Section 5. In terms of the holomorphic coordinate z, we find\nd log V\n1\n)]dt + z\u03c3dWt .\ndz = z[2i + \u03c3 2 (1 \u2212\n2\nd\u03c7\n\n(15)\n\nThis is an equation that will be generalised in Section 5. Finally the Gauss\ncurvature (10) is given by\nK=\u2212\n\n1 d2 log V\n.\n2V d\u03c72\n8\n\n(16)\n\n\fComparing (14) and (16) we see that if the curvature K is positive then the\ndrift in the SSE for \u03c7 is monotonic and increasing in \u03c7.\nBy assumption there is a fixed point at r = 0 or \u03c7 = \u2212\u221e. Here S = 0\nand dS/d\u03b8 = 1, and one can calculate the limit of the drift in \u03c7 in (14) as\n\u2212\u03c3 2 . The drift is therefore towards the fixed point. Now consider increasing\n\u03c7. If dS/d\u03b8 ever has a zero then the positivity of K forces S to have another\nzero and completeness then requires dS/d\u03b8 = \u22121 at this zero. It easy to see\nthat this zero occurs at \u03c7 = \u221e. The manifold is now necessarily the sphere,\nand the limit of the drift near this fixed point is \u03c3 2 , so again it is towards\nthe fixed point. The drift changes sign at the maximum of V . If dS/d\u03b8 never\nhas a zero then the drift never changes sign and for all \u03c7 is towards the fixed\npoint at \u03c7 = \u2212\u221e.\nBy calculating specific examples of surfaces of revolution in Euclidean\nthree-space one finds that for large positive \u03c7 on an asymptotically hyperbolic\nsurface the drift tends to \u2212k\u03c3 2 where k is a positive constant less than\nunity, while for an asymptotically parabolic surface the drift tends to zero as\nO(\u03c7\u22121).\nIn the case when the manifold is a sphere, it is possible to calculate\nthe probabilities \u03c0+ and \u03c0\u2212 , that the evolution terminates at \u03c7 = \u221e or at\n\u03c7 = \u2212\u221e respectively, in terms of the initial value of \u03c7. This is done by\nsolving the backward Fokker-Planck equation associated with the SDE (14)\nwith the relevant boundary conditions ([4]). The result for \u03c0+ is\n\u03c0+ =\n\nH(\u03c7) \u2212 H(\u2212\u221e)\nH(\u221e) \u2212 H(\u2212\u221e)\n\nwith \u03c0\u2212 = 1 \u2212 \u03c0+ .\nFor the asymptotically hyperbolic or parabolic (or even cylindrical) examples, the same calculation gives \u03c0\u2212 = 1, as expected . In other words,\nthe reduction proceeds towards the single 'eigenstate', ultimately resulting\nin collapse.\n\n4\n\nReduction processes on two-dimensional state\nmanifolds\n\nIn two dimensions there are many more curvature components, and as a\nconsequence the restriction that just one holomorphic sectional curvature\n9\n\n\fshould be positive is not a strong one. Simple examples of K\u00e4hler manifolds\nwith this property can be constructed by taking products of a Riemann\nsurface with an example from the previous section. More interesting examples\narise if we assume that there are more observables and look for processes that\ncollapse or reduce several of these observables at once. With this possibility\nin view, we consider metrics with a U(2) action transitive on three-surfaces,\nequivalently stated as an action with three-dimensional principal orbits. That\nis to say, we have holomorphic Killing vectors T and Xi , for i = 1, 2, 3, with\nthe commutators\n[Xi , Xj ] = \u2212\u01ebij k Xk ; [Xi , T ] = 0.\n\n(17)\n\nWe shall thus be led to examine explicit examples of nonlinear state manifolds with observables H and Si associated with the symmetries T and Xi\nrespectively, which we can think of as energy and spin respectively. We\nshall consider the evolution defined by T and seek manifolds that give rise\nto collapse processes for the energy. It will turn out that some of these\nsimultaneously reduce the spin.\nWe begin by introducing a set of Euler angles (\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c8), in terms of which\nwe shall take the Killing vectors to be given by the following expressions:\nX1 + iX2 = ei\u03c6 (i\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 cot \u03b8\n+ csc \u03b8 ),\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c8\n\n(18)\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\nT =\n.\n\u2202\u03c8\n\nX3 =\n\nWe shall work with the usual basis of invariant one-forms \u03c3i , which are given\nin these coordinates by\n\u03c31 + i\u03c32 = ei\u03c8 (d\u03b8 \u2212 i sin \u03b8d\u03c6),\n\u03c33 = d\u03c8 + cos \u03b8d\u03c8,\n\n(19)\n\nso that d\u03c31 = \u03c32 \u2227 \u03c33 , d\u03c32 = \u03c33 \u2227 \u03c31 and d\u03c33 = \u03c31 \u2227 \u03c32 . The most general\nmetric with the desired symmetry is now\nds2 = dt2 + a2 (t)( \u03c312 + \u03c322 ) + c2 (t)\u03c332 .\n\n(20)\n\nThe metric depends on a pair of functions a(t) and c(t), where t, which we\ncan think of as either a 'time' or a 'radial' coordinate, labels the surfaces\n10\n\n\fof homogeneity. The generic surface of homogeneity, or equivalently the\nprincipal orbit of the symmetry group U(2), can be a three-sphere or a Lens\nspace L(3, n) which is a quotient of the three-sphere by a cyclic group of order\nn, and the orbits degenerate at zeroes of a and/or c. Given the topology of\nthe principal orbit, the topology of the underlying manifold M is determined\nby the nature of the degenerate orbits and the (one-dimensional) manifold\nsay T which t ranges over. Clearly this must be one of four possibilities: a\ncircle, an interval, the whole line or a half-line. The first two give compact\nstate-manifolds and the last two give noncompact state-manifolds.\nIt will be convenient to work with a particular orthonormal frame for this\nmetric, namely\n\u03b80 = dt, \u03b81 = a\u03c31 , \u03b82 = a\u03c32 , \u03b83 = c\u03c33 .\n\n(21)\n\nIn terms of this frame we define the complex structure J by\nJ\u03b80 = \u03b83 , J\u03b81 = \u03b82 .\nThe corresponding two-form is then given by\n\u03c9 = cdt \u2227 \u03c33 + a2 \u03c31 \u2227 \u03c32 .\n\n(22)\n\nIt can be checked that the complex structure is automatically integrable and\npreserved by the Killing vectors, so that these are all holomorphic. The\nK\u00e4hler condition is that the form \u03c9 given by (22) should be closed. This\nrequires that\nd(a2 )\n= c.\n(23)\ndt\nEquation (23) immediately shows that T cannot be a circle: if a were periodic\nin t then c would have zeroes at which the metric would degenerate. On the\nother hand, since c2 = g(T, T ), we need at least one zero in c or there are no\nfixed points of the evolution. This shows that T must be either an interval,\nin which case there will be two critical values of H, or a half-line, when there\nwill be just one.\nWe next find Hamiltonian functions for the four Killing vectors. Let us\ndenote these Hamiltonian functions as H for T and Si for Xi . Then from\n(18), (19) and (22) these are easily found as\nH = \u2212a2 ,\nS1 + iS2 = \u2212a2 sin \u03b8ei\u03c6 ,\nS3 = \u2212a2 cos \u03b8.\n11\n\n\fAs a consequence, we note that\nH 2 = S12 + S22 + S32 .\nWith \u03c9 as in (22) it is a simple matter to check that the Poisson brackets\n\u03c9(T, Xi ) all vanish, so that the observables Si commute with the Hamiltonian H. The Si have the usual SU(2) commutators with each other, i.e.\n\u03c9(S1, S2 ) = S3 , \u03c9(S2, S3 ) = S1 and \u03c9(S3 , S1 ) = S2 .\nIt is convenient to introduce a new radial coordinate R = 2a, which is\nallowed because \u0227 6= 0 in the interior of the coordinate range (otherwise c\nwould have a zero, which can only happen at the end of the range). Then\nc = 12 R\u1e58 and the metric (20) can be written in the form\nds2 =\n\n1\n1\n1\ndR2 + R2 (\u03c312 + \u03c322 ) + R2 F \u03c332 ,\nF\n4\n4\n\n(24)\n\nwhere F (R) = \u1e582 . Written like this, the metric depends on one function F of\nR. There are various possibilities for the topology of the underlying manifold,\ndetermined by the range of R for which F is positive and the behaviour of F\nnear its zeroes. There is some standard terminology too: see, for example,\nreference [14]. If R = 0 is in the allowed range then for completeness of\nthe metric we need F = 1 there: this is the condition that the coordinate\nsingularity, which is like the singularity at the origin of polar coordinates,\ncan be removed and the manifold can be completed by inserting a point. A\ncoordinate singularity of this kind is called a 'nut' in the literature.\nFor completeness at a zero of F , say at R = R0 6= 0, we need\nR0 F \u2032 (R0 ) = \u00b12n\n\n(25)\n\nfor a positive integer n, where the principal orbit is L(3, n), so n = 1 if the\nprincipal orbit is a three-sphere. In this case the coordinate singularity can\nbe removed and the manifold completed by inserting a two-sphere. A coordinate singularity of this kind is called a 'bolt' in the literature. If there are\ntwo bolts then for completeness they must have the same n with one plus\nand one minus in (25). If there is a nut and a bolt then the principal orbits\nare three-spheres and n = 1 at the bolt. There cannot be two nuts because\nbetween them \u0227 would have a zero whence so would c by (23) and there would\nbe a bolt before the second nut. We shall see below how the possibilities are\nconstrained further by conditions of positivity on the curvature.\n\n12\n\n\fWe can calculate the dispersions V and Vi associated with the observables\nH and Si respectively by use of (18) and (24). These turn out to be\nV\nV1\nV2\nV3\n\n1 2\nR F,\n4\n1 2\nR (sin2 \u03b8 + F cos2 \u03b8),\n=\n4\n1 2\n=\nR (cos2 \u03c6 + sin2 \u03c6(cos2 \u03b8 + F sin2 \u03b8)),\n4\n1 2\nR (sin2 \u03c6 + cos2 \u03c6(cos2 \u03b8 + F sin2 \u03b8)).\n=\n4\n\n=\n\n(26)\n\nThe fixed points of the Killing vectors, which are the zeroes of the respective\ndispersions, can be read off from (26). All four Killing vectors vanish at the\nnut, if there is one. Thus a nut is an isolated fixed point of T , and therefore\na non-degenerate critical point of H, as well as an isolated fixed point of\neach Xi . The observables H and Si all vanish there. If there is a bolt, then\nT vanishes at all points of it while each Xi vanishes at a pair of antipodal\npoints, and for varying i the pairs are symmetrically arranged. Thus a bolt\nis a whole two-sphere, in fact a CP1 , of fixed points of T that are degenerate critical points of H, and each Si has two critical values on the bolt.\nThe Hamiltonian takes the value H0 = \u2212R02 /4 on a bolt at R = R0 and the\ncritical values of the Si are \u00b1H0 .\nWe next need to calculate the Riemann tensor for the metric (24). This\nis readily done in the orthonormal basis of (21), with the following result:\nR0101 = R0202 = \u2212\n\n1 \u2032\nF,\n2R\n\n1\n1 \u2032\nR0123 = R0231 = \u2212 R0312 =\nF,\n2\n2R\n3\n1\nR0303 = \u2212 (F \u2032\u2032 + F \u2032 ),\n2\nR\n4\nR1212 = 2 (1 \u2212 F ),\n(27)\nR\nwhere the prime denotes d/dR. Once we have the Riemann tensor, we can\ncalculate the biholomorphic sectional curvatures. Suppose that U and W are\n\n13\n\n\farbitrary unit vectors, so that\nU = Ae0 + Be1 + Ce2 + De3 ,\nW = \u03b1e0 + \u03b2e1 + \u03b3e2 + \u03b4e3 ,\nwhere A2 + B 2 + C 2 + D 2 = \u03b12 + \u03b2 2 + \u03b3 2 + \u03b4 2 = 1 and the ei are the basis\nof vector fields dual to the \u03b8i . Then\nJU = \u2212De0 \u2212 Ce1 + Be2 + Ae3 ,\nJW = \u2212\u03b4e0 \u2212 \u03b3e1 + \u03b2e2 + \u03b1e3 ,\nand the corresponding biholomorphic sectional curvature can be written\nR(U, JU, W, JW ) = R0303 (\u03b12 + \u03b4 2 )(A2 + D 2 )\n+R0312 ((\u03b1B + \u03b2A \u2212 \u03b3D \u2212 \u03b4C)2\n+(\u03b1C + \u03b2D + \u03b3A + \u03b4B)2 )\n+R1212 (\u03b2 2 + \u03b3 2 )(B 2 + C 2 ).\n\n(28)\n\nFor the Killing vector T = ce0 that determines the evolution, the relevant\nholomorphic sectional curvature KH from (6) and above is R0303 . The condition for a collapse process for H is therefore\nR0303 = \u2212\n\n1\n(R3 F \u2032)\u2032 > 0.\n2R3\n\n(29)\n\nIf we want the condition for this process to reduce, say, S3 as well, we first\nneed X3 in the basis (ei ). This is\nX3 = a sin \u03b8(sin \u03c8e1 \u2212 cos \u03c8e2 ) + c cos \u03b8e3 .\nNow for the biholomorphic sectional curvature, as defined by analogy with\n(8) we find\n1\nKHS3 = (R0303 F cos2 \u03b8 + R0312 sin2 \u03b8),\n\u2206\n2\n2\nwhere \u2206 = F cos \u03b8 + sin \u03b8.\nWe shall have a reduction process for S3 as well as for H if this is positive\ntoo, which requires\n1\nR0312 = \u2212 F \u2032 > 0\n(30)\n2R\n14\n\n\fin addition to (29). We would obtain the same condition by considering S1\nor S2 instead of S3 , so that (29) and (30) taken together are necessary and\nsufficient for the evolution defined by T to collapse H and simultaneously\nreduce any one of the Si .\nWe obtain a range of examples by considering various cases, which we\nnow proceed to summarise.\n\nCase 1: one nut and one bolt\nSuppose that F is positive at R = 0, has a zero at R = R0 > 0, and is positive\nin between, so that the state manifold M is compact. For completeness we\nneed a nut at R = 0, so that F (0) = 1, F \u2032 (0) = 0, and the principal orbit\nis a three-sphere, and a bolt at R = R0 , so that R0 F \u2032 (R0 ) = \u22122. We can\nnow identify M as topologically (and therefore in fact biholomorphically)\nequivalent to CP2 .\nFor a collapse process for H we need (29), but since F \u2032 (0) = 0 this will\nensure that F \u2032 (R) < 0, from which (30) will necessarily follow: by insisting\non a collapse process for H we automatically obtain a reduction process for\nS3 . Finally, F is decreasing with F (0) = 1 so that F < 1 and by (27) this\nensures that R1212 > 0. Putting this together with (28) we now have enough\nto make every biholomorphic sectional curvature positive. It is a theorem\nof Siu and Yau ([15], see also [12]) that a compact K\u00e4hler manifold with\npositive biholomorphic sectional curvatures is necessarily CPn .\nThe reduction process for S3 will not necessarily be a collapse process as\nwe shall see from a discussion of the L\u00fcders postulate in Section 5. However,\nsince every biholomorphic sectional curvature is positive given (29), we could\ninstead use S3 as Hamiltonian. This new SSE would give a collapse process\nfor S3 which would also necessarily reduce H. Now the critical points of S3\nare nondegenerate and therefore are also critical points of H, as we can see\nin any case from (26). Thus the reduction process for H is in fact a collapse\nprocess for H and this process simultaneously collapses S3 and H.\nThis example, with a metric on CP2 that is different from the FubiniStudy metric, is very similar to the example with a degenerate H discussed\nin the Section 1, and can be seen as a natural generalisation of this example.\n\n15\n\n\fCase 2: two bolts\nThe other compact case arises if F has zeroes at two nonvanishing values of\nR and is positive in between. Call these R0 and R1 with R0 \u2264 R1 . Then we\nhave two bolts and we require that\nR0 F \u2032 (R0 ) = \u2212R1 F \u2032 (R1 ) = 2n\n\n(31)\n\nfor some positive integer n, so that the principal orbit is L(3, n). Looking\nat (27) we see that R0312 must change sign, so that by (30) we cannot have\na reduction process for S3 even though, by (29), we can arrange to have a\ncollapse process for H. Note also that the critical points of H lie on two\ndistinct complex projective lines, the two bolts. This could not happen in\nCP2 where two complex projective lines necessarily meet.\nThere are some specific examples of this case due to Hitchin [6]. In our\nnotation they are defined by\n(R2 \u2212 1)(sn + 1 \u2212 R2 )\n,\nsR2\nwhere s is a positive real constant and n is a positive integer greater than\n1. There are bolts at the two positive zeroes of F and (31) is satisfied with\nthe same n at both. The state manifold M is a rational surface, specifically\nthe projective space P(O(n) + O(0)) of the vector bundle O(n) + O(0) over\nCP1 .\nFrom (29) we find R0303 = 4/s which is positive, so that we do have a\ncollapse process for H, but as was already noted, this process does not simultaneously reduce any of the Si . The interest of this example for Hitchin\nwas that for small enough s, in fact for s < 1/n2 , the holomorphic sectional\ncurvatures are all positive (although the biholomorphic sectional curvatures\nare not, as can be seen from the theorem of Siu and Yau [15] already cited).\nF (R) =\n\nPutting these two cases together, we can assert that for a compact M\nwith the symmetry assumed here, if the stochastic Schr\u00f6dinger evolution\ncollapses H and reduces S3 then the manifold must be CP2 with a metric of\npositive biholomorphic sectional curvature.\n\nCase 3: semi-infinite with a nut\nThe simplest noncompact case has a nut at R = 0, for which therefore\nF (0) = 1, F \u2032 (0) = 0, and F is everywhere positive. If we have a collapse\n16\n\n\fprocess for H then, by (29), we must have (R3 F \u2032 )\u2032 > 0. With the boundary\nconditions from the nut this forces F \u2032 < 0 and so 0 < F < 1 for all positive\nR. The state manifold in this case is C2 .\nNow from (27) and (28) all biholomorphic sectional curvatures are positive. In particular the collapse process for H is simultaneously a reduction\nprocess for all the Si . Further, this reduction process is also a collapse process because the nut is a nondegenerate critical point for all the observables.\nHowever this case is less interesting because the endpoint of the stochastic\nevolution is the origin, where all the observables are zero.\nA simple example of this case is given by\nF =\n\n1 + \u03bbR2\n,\n1 + R2\n\nwhere \u03bb is a real constant with 0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1. The corresponding metric is the\nflat metric on C2 for \u03bb = 1, is asymptotic to a deformed ('Berger') threesphere at infinity if 0 < \u03bb < 1 and is ALF (or asymptotically locally flat) in\nthe language of [14] if \u03bb = 0.\n\nCase 4: semi-infinite with a bolt\nThe final case has a bolt at say R = R0 so that F (R0 ) = 0, R0 F \u2032 (R0 ) = 2n,\nwith F > 0 for R > R0 . We can arrange to satisfy (29) so that we have a\ncollapse process for H, but we cannot satisfy (30) and simultaneously obtain\na reduction process for Si . A familiar example of this case is the EguchiHanson metric ([3], [14]) which has F = 1 \u2212 a4 /R4 . This has a bolt with\nn = 2 at R = a and is asymptotically locally Euclidean in the standard\nterminology (see, for example, [14]).\nIn summary, we have constructed a variety of two-dimensional quantum\nstate manifolds admitting collapse processes for energy, and some of these\nsimultaneously reduce the spin. The most interesting case is the first, which\ncorresponds to a metric on CP2 with positive biholomorphic sectional curvatures but which is different from the Fubini-Study metric. In the next\nsection, we consider a generalisation to metrics with N complex dimensions\nand U(N)-symmetry.\n\n17\n\n\f5\n\nK\u00e4hler metrics with U(N) symmetry\n\nWe want to generalise the calculations of the last section to the consideration\nof K\u00e4hler metrics with U(N) -symmetry transitive on hypersurfaces. To do\nthis we mimic the calculation leading to (3). Suppose we have complex\ncoordinates z a , a = 1, . . . , N, where these are coordinate indices (not abstract\nindices), and a K\u00e4hler potential \u03a3(u) where\nu = r 2 = \u03b4ab\u0304 z a z \u0304b =\n\nN\nX\na=1\n\n|z a |2 .\n\n(32)\n\nThe metric in these coordinates is ds2 = 2gab\u0304 dz a dz \u0304b with gab\u0304 = \u2202 2 \u03a3/\u2202z a \u2202 z \u0304b\nso that\ngab\u0304 = \u03a3\u0307\u03b4ab\u0304 + \u03a3\u0308z\u0101 z\u0304b ,\n(33)\nwhere as before the dot means d/du, and we have introduced the notation\nz\u0101 = \u03b4b\u0101 z b , z\u0304b = \u03b4b\u0101 z \u0304a .\nThe metric (33) is positive definite provided the following conditions hold:\n\u03a3\u0307 > 0, \u03a3\u0307 + u\u03a3\u0308 > 0.\nThe metric degenerates where either of these quantities vanishes; but, as\nwe shall see, these degeneracies may correspond to removable coordinate\nsingularities. The inverse metric is easily found to be given by\ng ab\u0304 =\n\n1 ab\u0304\n(\u03b4 \u2212 Qz a z \u0304b ),\n\u03a3\u0307\n\n(34)\n\nwhere Q = \u03a3\u0308/(\u03a3\u0307 + u\u03a3\u0308). In these coordinates we can find the following\nholomorphic Killing vectors:\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212 z \u0304b  \u0304b ),\na\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\n\u2202\n \u0304 \u2202\nX = i(z a Hac c \u2212 z \u0304b Hb\u0304d  \u0304d ),\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\nT = i(z a\n\n \u0304\n\n \u0304\n\n(35)\n\nwhere Hab = \u03b4 b\u0101 Ha\u0101 and Hb\u0304d = \u03b4 bd Hbb\u0304 for an arbitrary trace-free Hermitian\nmatrix Ha\u0101 . It is easy to see that these are holomorphic and they are Killing\nvectors since they preserve the function u of (32). The Killing vectors of\n18\n\n\fthe form X generate the Lie algebra of SU(N) as Ha\u0101 runs over trace-free\nHermitian matrices. The Hamiltonians for these Killing vectors turn out to\nbe\nH = \u2212u\u03a3\u0307,\n(36)\n\nand\n\nS = \u2212Hab\u0304 z a z \u0304b \u03a3\u0307.\n\n(37)\n\nWe note that, interestingly, (36) is formally just as in the one-dimensional\ncase. With the aid of (34) the dispersion V of H is found to be\nV = 2g ab\u0304 \u2202a H\u2202b\u0304 H = \u22122u\u1e22,\nwhich is also formally the same as in the one-dimensional case (13). The\ncritical points of H are at the zeroes of V , that is to say at u = 0 or at\n\u03a3\u0307 + u\u03a3\u0308 = 0, and the second of these is where the metric degenerates.\nThe dispersion V S of S can be written in either of the following forms:\n\nor\n\nV S = 2gab\u0304 Hc\u0304b\u0304 z \u0304c Hda z d\n\n(38)\n\nV S = 2(\u03a3\u0307Hc\u0304b\u0304 Hb\u0304d z \u0304c z d + \u03a3\u0308(Hab\u0304 z a z \u0304b )2 ).\n\n(39)\n\nFrom (38) one can see that the fixed points of X, which are the critical points\nof S and the zeroes of V S , necessarily occur either at u = 0, where every z a\nis zero, or on the surface where the metric degenerates. The latter critical\npoints, by (39), occur for z a satisfying\n(\u03b4ab\u0304 z a z \u0304b )(Hc\u0304\u0113 H\u0113d z d z \u0304c ) = (Hab\u0304 z a z \u0304b )2 ,\nwhich holds when z a is (proportional to) an eigenvector of Hab . We can assume that the eigenvalues of Hab are distinct (since we can choose a basis of\ntrace-free Hermitian matrices all elements of which have distinct eigenvalues)\nand then the critical points of S will be nondegenerate.\nWe want to write down the SSE (4) in these coordinates. For this we\nnote with the aid of (34) that\n\u2207a H = z a\nand\n\u2207a V =\n\n\u22122uV\u0307 a\nz .\nV\n19\n\n\fNow (4) becomes just\ndz a = z a [2i +\n\n\u03c32\n2uV\u0307\n(1 \u2212\n)]dt + z a \u03c3dWt ,\n2\nV\n\n(40)\n\nwhich should be compared with equation (15). Recall that the indices in (40)\nare coordinate indices. To give something like (3), we introduce a form of\npolar coordinates\nz a = r\u03b6 a\n(41)\nwhere \u03b4 \u03b6 a\u03b6 \u0304b = 1. The metric then becomes\nab\u0304\n\nds2 = 2gab\u0304 dz a dz \u0304b\n\n(42)\n\n1\n= 2(\u03a3\u0307 + u\u03a3\u0308)dr 2 + 2u\u03a3\u0307\u03b4ab\u0304 d\u03b6 a d\u03b6 \u0304b + u2 \u03a3\u0308 \u03982 ,\n4\nwhere \u0398 is defined by\n\n\u0398 = 2i\u03b4ab\u0304 \u03b6 a d\u03b6 \u0304b.\n\n(43)\n\nEquation (42) is the counterpart of (3). If we use the polar decomposition\n(41) in (40) we find\nd\u03b6 a = 2i\u03b6 a dt,\n(44)\nwhich is again deterministic, just as the equation for \u03c6 in (14) was. This is\nthe significant result for the L\u00fcders postulate discussed in the Introduction.\nSuppose the SSE starts from an initial point with coordinates z0a . By a linear\nchange of coordinates, which is a symmetry, we can arrange that z0a = 0 for\na = 2, . . . , N, and then the evolution (44) will ensure that the state remains\non this one-dimensional complex submanifold.\nThe other part of (40) is conveniently written in terms of \u03c7 = 12 log u and\nthen another application of Ito's lemma leads to\n1 d log V\ndt + \u03c3dWt ,\nd\u03c7t = \u2212 \u03c3 2\n2\nd\u03c7\n\n(45)\n\nwhich is precisely the same as in the one-dimensional case (14).\nTo make the metric (42) more like (24) in appearance, we introduce the\nradial coordinate R by R2 = 2u\u03a3\u0307 to find\nds2 =\n\n1\n1\n1\ndR2 + R2 gF S + R2 F \u03982 ,\nF\n4\n4\n20\n\n(46)\n\n\fwhere\nF =\n\n\u03a3\u0307 + u\u03a3\u0308\n,\n\u03a3\u0307\n\n1\ngF S = \u03b4ab\u0304 d\u03b6 a d\u03b6 \u0304b \u2212 \u03982 .\n4\n\nHere gF S is the standard Fubini-Study metric on CPN \u22121 , with constant\nholomorphic sectional curvature equal to one, and \u0398 from (43) is real because\nof the normalisation of \u03b6 a . By transforming the metric to look like (24), we\nmake it easier to discuss the underlying topology. As before, the range of the\n'time'-coordinate is an interval for a compact state-manifold or a half-line for\na noncompact state-manifold.\nThe next step is to find the connection and curvature, and for this we\nmay use formulae from Kodaira and Morrow [13]:\n\u0393abc = g a\u0101 \u2202b gc\u0101 ,\n\nRabc\u0304d = \u2202c\u0304 \u0393abd .\n\nThese can be found explicitly in terms of \u03a3. For our purposes we need KH\nas in (6) with the Killing vector T of (36). This turns out to be\nKH = \u2212\n\n1 d2 log V\n,\n2V d\u03c72\n\n(47)\n\nwhich is the same expression as (16). The positivity of \u1e22 is needed for\nthe metric (24) to be positive definite so again the positivity of KH forces\nthe drift in (45) to be monotonic. If we use the metric form (46) then the\nconditions of positivity turn out to be precisely what they were in Section\n4. Thus positivity of KH is again (29) and for positivity of the holomorphic\nbisectional curvatures KHS we need as well (30). Finally, all holomorphic\nbisectional curvatures are positive if as well R1212 as given in (27) is positive.\nFollowing through the analysis of nuts and bolts, we have the four cases\nas before:\nCase 1: one nut and one bolt is a metric on CPN with positive holomorphic bisectional curvature, so that the SSE gives a collapse process for\nthe Hamiltonian that is simultaneously a reduction process for any one of\nthe SU(N) observables. The Hamiltonian has two critical values: one (nondegenerate) occurs at a single point (the nut), and one (degenerate) on a\nCPN \u22121 (the bolt). Any one of the SU(N) variables has N nondegenerate\ncritical points on the bolt and one at the nut. The SSE confines the evolution to a submanifold that is actually a complex projective line through\n21\n\n\fthe nut and the initial state. Thus the L\u00fcders postulate holds here. This\nanalysis includes the case N = 2 which we did not do separately in Section 4.\nCase 2: two bolts is a metric on the projective space P(O(n)+O(0)) of the\nvector bundle O(n)+O(0) over CPN \u22121 . The Hamiltonian has two degenerate\ncritical values, at the two bolts respectively, and the L\u00fcders postulate still\nholds but we do not have a reduction process for the SU(N)\u2212observables.\nIn particular, we observe that, as in Section 4, a compact state-manifold\nwith the symmetry considered here gives a collapse process for H and simultaneously a reduction process for any one of the spins S if and only if it\nis biholomorphic to CPN with a metric of positive holomorphic bisectional\ncurvature.\nCase 3: semi-infinite with a nut and Case 4: semi-infinite with a\nbolt have a single critical value for the Hamiltonian, respectively nondegenerate and degenerate, and Case 3 has positive bisectional holomorphic\ncurvature while Case 4 does not. The SSE confines the evolution to a linear submanifold, but we cannot speak of the L\u00fcders postulate in these cases\nsince there is only one eigenvalue.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to D.C.
