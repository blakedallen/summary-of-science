It presents a\nnew perspective for all foundational and interpretational\nissues and highlights new essential differences between\nclassical and quantum theory. Quantum entanglement\nhas an extremely important position in the processing\nand transmitting of quantum information. Many useful\napplications such as quantum dense coding [1], certain\ntypes of quantum key distribution [2] and GreenbergerHorne-Zeilinger correlations [3] are based on the existence\nof quantum entanglement.\nOne of the extremely striking exhibitions of entanglement is quantum teleportation. In 1993, Bennett et\nal suggested a quantum method of teleportation [4], by\nwhich an unknown quantum state of one qubit can be\ntransmitted from one place to another with the aid of\nsome classical communication, provided that the sender\nAlice and the receiver Bob have previously shared halves\nof a two qubit entangled state. At present, teleportation\nhas been generalized to many cases [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\n11, 12] in theoretical aspect. Experimentally the teleportation of a photon polarization state has been demonstrated [13, 14]. In virtue of a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, teleportation of a coherent state corresponding to continuous variable system was realized also in the\nlaboratory [15].\nAnother important part of quantum information is\nquantum cryptology. Amazingly, the principles of quantum mechanics such as the uncertainty principle and\nquantum correlations have now provided the foundation stone to a new approach to cryptography - quantum cryptography. It has been believed that quantum cryptography can solve many problems that are impossible from the perspective of conventional cryptography. Since the first quantum cryptography protocol\nusing quantum mechanics to distribute keys was proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984 [16], numerous quantum cryptographic protocols has been proposed\n[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30].\nRecently, Shimizu and Imoto [31, 32] and Beige et al\n\n[33] proposed novel quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) schemes. In these protocols the sender Alice and the receiver Bob communicate messages directly\nwithout a shared secret key to encrypt them and the message is deterministically sent through the quantum channel, but can be read only after obtaining additional classical information for each qubit. After that a few theoretical schemes for QSDC were put forward [34, 35, 36, 37].\nHowever, in all these QSDC schemes one must send the\nqubits with secret messages in a public channel. Therefore, a potential eavesdropper, Eve, can attack the qubits\nwith secret messages in transmission. In order to conquer this limitation several QSDC protocols with using\nquantum correlations of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)\npairs or Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and\nteleportation, have been proposed [38, 39, 40, 41]. In the\nframework of these protocols there is not a transmission\nof qubits carrying the secret messages in a public channel, so that the secret messages can not be attacked in\ntransmission.\nThis letter contains twofold purposes. One is to\npresent a method for teleporting an unknown quantum\nstate; the other is to provide a QSDC protocol by applying the method for teleporting.\nWe describe the process for teleporting an unknown\nquantum state as follows. Suppose that an unknown\nquantum state of particle 1 is\n|\u03c6i1 = \u03b1|0i1 + \u03b2|1i1 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwith |\u03b1|2 +|\u03b2|2 = 1, and particle 1 is in Alice's possession.\nAlice wants to teleport the state |\u03c6i to the receiver Bob.\nTo do so Alice introduces an ancillary particle 2 initially\nin a known state |0i2 . Then she makes a Controlled-Not\noperation on two particles with particle 1 and particle 2\nbeing controlled bit and target bit respectively. By completing this unitary operation, the quantum state of the\nwhole system consisting of two particles 1 and 2 becomes\n|\u03a8i12 = \u03b1|00i12 + \u03b2|11i12 .\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nThen Alice sends the particle 2 to Bob and she will be\ninformed via a classical channel when Bob receives the\nparticle 2. A algebraic rearrangement of Eq.(2) in terms\nof |+i1 = \u221a12 (|0i + |1i)1 and |\u2212i1 = \u221a12 (|0i \u2212 |1i)1 leads\nto\n|\u03a8i12\n\n1\n= \u221a |+i1 (\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i)2\n2\n1\n+ \u221a |\u2212i1 (\u03b1|0i \u2212 \u03b2|1i)2 .\n2\n\n(3)\n\nEvidently, if Alice performs a local measurement on her\nparticle 1 in the basis {|+i1 , |\u2212i1 }, then regardless of\nthe identity of |\u03c6i1 , each outcome will occur with equal\nprobability 21 . Therefore, this measurement can not give\nAlice information at all about the identity of the state\nand it would collapse the resulting state of particle 2 to\n(\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i)2 = I|\u03c6i2 \u2261 U0 |\u03c6i2 ,\n(\u03b1|0i \u2212 \u03b2|1i)2 = \u03c3z |\u03c6i2 \u2261 U1 |\u03c6i2\n\n(4)\n\nrespectively. Here I is the identity operator, and \u03c3z indicates Pauli operator. Obviously, in each case the state\nof particle 2 is related to |\u03c6i2 by a fixed unitary transformation Ui (i = 0, 1) independent of the identity of |\u03c6i.\nHence if Alice tells Bob her actual measurement outcome,\nthen Bob will be capable of applying the corresponding\ninverse transformation Ui\u22121 to his particle 2, restoring it\nto state |\u03c6i in every case, i.e. Bob can convert the state of\nparticle 2 into an exact replica of the unknown quantum\nstate which Alice destroyed.\nHence Alice is able to communicate to Bob the full\nquantum information of |\u03c6i by this method. As a result of the process, Alice learns nothing whatever about\nidentity of |\u03c6i. In the process of teleporting an unknown\nquantum state, Bob is left with a perfect instance of |\u03c6i\nand hence no participants can gain any further information about its identity.\nAs a matter of fact, in comparing our protocol with the\nstandard teleportation scheme [4] our protocol is more\neconomical one. On one hand, in present scheme only\ntwo particles are involved, that is not the same as that of\nstandard teleportation scheme, in which three particles\ntake part in. On the other hand the classical information\nneeded to be transmitted is one bit, more economical\nthan that of the standard one in which two bits classical\ninformation must be sent.\nApparently, this method can be generalized to\nmultiple-particle cases easily.\nAs an application of this method for teleporting an\nunknown quantum state, now we would like to suggest a\nQSDC protocol, which will be stated as follows.\nAssume that the sender Alice wants to communicate\nimportant messages to the receiver Bob, and they share\na set of EPR pairs, the maximally entangled pair in the\nBell state\n1\n|\u03a6+ iAB = \u221a (|00iAB + |11iAB ).\n2\n\n(5)\n\nObviously, one approach to prepare the EPR pair can be\nthat Alice first makes one particle in the state \u221a12 (|0i +\n|1i), and performs the Controlled-Not operation on two\nparticles, where the state of other particle is |0i initially.\nIt leads to that the pair of the two particles is in the\nBell state stated in Eq.(5). Then Alice sends half of the\npair to Bob. They can also obtain EPR pairs in other\nmethod as mentioned in Ref. [38]. Before communication\nthey must do some tests, for example to use the schemes\ntesting the security of EPR pairs (quantum channel) in\nRefs. [2, 18, 26, 36, 38]. Passing the test asserts that\nthey continue to hold sufficiently pure, entangled quantum states. However, if tampering has occurred, these\nEPR pairs should be discarded and new EPR pairs should\nbe constructed again.\nAfter insuring the security of quantum channel, Alice\nand Bob begin to communicate. Alice performs operation\nI or \u03c3z on the particle A according to the secret messages.\nFor instance if the secrete messages are 00101011, then\nthe operation Alice performed should be II\u03c3z I\u03c3z I\u03c3z \u03c3z\non eight EPR pairs respectively. In other words if the\nsecret message is 0 then the EPR pair is unchanged; otherwise EPR pair state should be \u221a12 (|00iAB \u2212 |11iAB ).\nThus Alice completes the transformation between the\nsecret messages and the states of EPR pairs, i.e. 0\nand 1 of the secret messages correspond to |\u03a6+ iAB =\n\u221a1 (|00iAB +|11iAB ) and |\u03a6\u2212 iAB = \u221a1 (|00iAB \u2212|11iAB )\n2\n2\nrespectively. After that Alice can use the method for\nteleporting an unknown quantum state stated above to\ntransfer the secret message to Bob. Alice makes firstly\nthe local measurement on her particle A in the basis\n{|+iA , |\u2212iA } and tells Bob the outcome of local measurement via a classical channel. According to the measurement results Bob makes the unitary transformation\non particle B, provided that if Alice's the measurement\nresult is |+i, then Bob do not apply any operator to his\nparticle B, otherwise Bob performs \u03c3z operation to his\nparticle B. Thus the secret messages have been transferred to the states of the particles in Bob's possession.\nFinally Bob makes a local measurement on the particle\nB in the basis {|+iB , |\u2212iB } which will tell him the secret\nmessage accurately.\nThis QSDC protocol has two notable features. One is\nthat in our scheme the classical information resource is\nsaved on since one bit classical information is only wanted\nto transmit one bit secret message in comparing with\nthe protocol in Ref.[38] in which in order to transfer one\nbit secret message two bit classical messages must be\nsent via a classical channel. Another is that in present\nprotocol there is not a particle with the secret message\ntransmitting between Alice and Bob, hence Eve can not\nattack the message quantum bit in transmission.\nEvidently, if the quantum channel is perfect EPR pairs,\nthe protocol must be a safety one. As mentioned in Ref.\n[38], by using the schemes testing the security of EPR\npairs, a perfect quantum channel can be obtained. So\nAlice and Bob can communicate the secret messages by\nthis protocol safely.\n\n\f3\nIn summary we give a method for teleporting an unknown quantum state, in which the sender Alice first\nuses a Controlled-Not operation on the particle in the unknown quantum state and an ancillary particle. Then the\nancillary particle is sent to Bob. When Alice knows that\nthe ancillary particle is received by Bob, she performs\na local measurement on the particle and sends Bob the\noutcome of the local measurement via a classical channel. According to the result of the measurement Bob\ncan restore the unknown quantum state, which Alice destroyed, on the ancillary particle. By the way a QSDC\ncommunication protocol is proposed. The communication is based on EPR pairs functioning as quantum channel. The QSDC protocol not only saves the classical information, but also defends signal against interference.\nApparently, in our QSDC scheme we requires the tech-\n\nnique of quantum storage to guarantee the EPR pairs being in the maximally entangled state. As a matter of fact\nthis technique is not fully developed at present. However\nit is of vital importance to quantum information, and\nthere has been great interest in developing it [42, 43, 44].\nWe believe that it will be available in the future, and\nhope our scheme will be realized in experiment.\n\n[1] C.
