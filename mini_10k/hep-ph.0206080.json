This phenomenon results from the see-saw mechanism and the\nalgebraic structure of the effective mass operator for the active neutrinos. The\nlarge hierarchy of the Dirac masses is drastically modified by a symmetric unitary\nmatrix R acting in the flavor space. A realistic pattern of neutrino masses and\nmixing is obtained. Maximal mixing for atmospheric neutrinos is attributed to\nthe charged lepton sector. Large mixing in solar neutrino oscillations is due to\nthe neutrino sector. Small Ue3 is a natural q\nconsequence of the model. The masses\nof the active neutrinos are given by \u03bc3 \u2248\n\n\u2206m2@ and \u03bc1 /\u03bc2 \u2248 tan2 \u03b8\u2299 .\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfter four decades of heroic experimental [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and theoretical [6] efforts, see\n[7, 8] and references therein, the problems of solar neutrinos have finally been solved. A\nunique solution of these problems exists corresponding to LMA MSW flavor oscillations\nof active neutrinos. By active neutrinos we understand those experimentally observed,\n\u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 . After recent results from SuperKamiokande [2] and SNO [5] all other\nsolutions of the solar neutrino problems are not allowed at 3\u03c3 level [9]. Simultaneously\nit becomes more and more clear that the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos are due\nto \u03bd\u03bc \u21c4 \u03bd\u03c4 transitions [10, 11]. The third important piece of information is the CHOOZ\nlimit [12] indicating that the element Ue3 of the Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (MNS) lepton\nmixing matrix [13] is small. In this article we show that all these experimental facts can\nbe nicely accommodated by assuming the see-saw mechanism [14] and a large hierarchy\nof the Dirac masses for three neutrinos. One can consider the results presented in the\npresent paper as a realistic realization of the ideas proposed in a recent paper by one\nof us [15]. It should be mentioned that there is no room in this model to explain LSND\nresults [16] in terms of oscillations. This model cannot also accommodate the large\nvalue of the Majorana mass parameter hm\u03bde i which follows from a recent interpretation\n[17] of the Heidelberg-Moscow data on neutrinoless double beta decays of 76 Ge [18].\nLet us start with a brief summary of the ideas and results presented in [15]. It has\nbeen shown in [15] that a rather small hierarchy of the observed low energy masses of\nthe active neutrinos can follow from a large hierarchy at the more fundamental level of\nthe Dirac masses. This can happen even in the case when the Majorana masses of the\nright-handed neutrinos are degenerate. Therefore large hierarchies in the Dirac masses\nof all other fundamental fermions, i.e. up quarks, down quarks and charged leptons,\ncan be accompanied by a large hierarchy of the Dirac masses for the neutrinos. This\nlarge hierarchy is drastically modified by a symmetric unitary operator R related to\nunitary transformations of the right-handed neutrinos. In some sense the underlying\nhierarchy of the Dirac masses is hidden and only mildly reflected in the effective low\nenergy masses. This phenomenon is due to the see-saw mechanism and the algebraic\nstructure of the low energy effective mass operator N describing the masses of the\nactive neutrinos.\nTherefore, in the lepton sector there are two operators acting in the flavor space\nwhich affect the low energy physics in a most important way. One is the MNS lepton\nmixing matrix UMNS [13] which plays a role similar to that of the Cabibbo-KobayashiMaskawa mixing matrix for quarks [19]. The other is the matrix R which is imprinted\nin the observable mass spectrum of the active neutrinos. Up to our knowledge this\nremarkable matrix R and its role in the low energy physics of neutrinos was not discussed in the literature before [15]. In [15] a form of R has been considered leading to a\nsignificant reduction of the mass hierarchy and a form of UMNS nicely accommodating\nthe small value of its Ue3 element. It has also been argued that the mass ratio for the\ntwo lighter active neutrinos is given by tan2 \u03b8\u2299 with \u03b8\u2299 being the mixing angle for solar\nneutrinos. In the present paper we show that for strongly hierarchical Dirac masses\nthe form of R considered in [15] is up to complex phase factors the only one leading\n1\n\n\fto acceptable low energy mass spectrum and lepton mixing matrix. We show also that\nthe smallness of Ue3 and the mass relations are preserved in the realistic model.\n\n2\n\nHidden hierarchy\n\nIn this section the see-saw mechanism for three families of leptons is discussed. We\nrepeat arguments given in [15] and show that a small hierarchy of low energy masses\ncan be obtained from a large hierarchy in the Dirac masses. We show that the observed\nsmall hierarchy for the active neutrinos fixes the form of the matrix R mentioned in\nthe Introduction up to some complex phase factors and small sub-leading terms. The\nmass matrix for the charged leptons can be written as\nL = VR diag(me , m\u03bc , m\u03c4 ) VL \u2261 VR m(l) VL\n\n(1)\n\nThe matrix VR multiplying m(l) from the left side can be made equal to one by an\nappropriate redefinition of the right-handed charged leptons. This has no observable\nconsequences because at our low energies only left-handed weak charged currents can\nbe studied. The corresponding Dirac mass matrix for the neutrinos is\nN = UR m(\u03bd) UL\n\n(2)\n\nm(\u03bd) = diag(m1 , m2 , m3 ) .\n\n(3)\n\nwith\nWe choose the reference frame in the flavor space such that the Majorana mass matrix\nof the right-handed neutrinos is diagonal. In general in this frame MR is described\nby its three different eigenvalues. However, as we demonstrate in the following, even\ntaking the simplest case of\nMR = M * 1\n(4)\nwe are able to build a phenomenologically successful model. The Majorana masses of\nthe right-handed neutrinos are equal to M, which is huge. This leads to the masses of\nactive neutrinos much smaller than the masses of other fundamental fermions (leptons\nand quarks).\nOf course there is an additional freedom for the right-handed Majorana masses not\nequal to each other but one can describe the neutrino oscillation data without any\nproblem assuming that they are all equal. In our present purely phenomenological\napproach we do not have at our disposal a sufficient amount of information to study\nthe mass spectrum of MR . This may be possible in a more complete theory of flavor,\nbut in this work we assume degenerate Majorana masses. It should be noted, however,\nthat the arguments which we present can be trivially generalized and applied to the\ncase of non-equal right-handed Majorana masses.\nThe form of the matrix MR depends on the reference frame in a non-trivial way.\nIn the frame employed in the present paper this matrix is assumed to be proportional\nto the unit matrix. However it may have a different form in another reference frame.\n2\n\n\fIn particular it need not be proportional to the unit matrix in the frame where the\nmatrix of neutrino Dirac masses is diagonal and so exhibits a strong hierarchy.\nOnce the reference frame in the flavor space is fixed by the condition that MR\nis diagonal the matrix UR in eq.(2) cannot be gauged away by a redefinition of the\nright-handed neutrino fields. Let us assume that m1 , m2 , and m3 are hierarchical\nm1 \u226a m2 \u226a m3\n\n(5)\n\nwhich means that the Dirac masses of the neutrinos exhibit the same strongly ordered hierarchical pattern as the Dirac masses of all other fundamental fermions. The\nmass spectrum of the active neutrinos is dictated by an effective mass operator N of\ndimension five\nN = N T MR\u22121 N = ULT m(\u03bd)T URT MR\u22121 UR m(\u03bd) UL .\n(6)\n\nThe algebraic structure of N implies that the resulting mass spectrum is extremely\nsensitive to the form of\n1 T\nU UR\n(7)\nURT MR\u22121 UR =\nM R\nwhere the simplifying assumption (4) has been used. The mass spectrum obtained\nfrom the matrix N in eq.(6) is now seen to depend crucially on the following matrix\nR,\nR = URT UR ,\n(8)\nwhich is symmetric and unitary. It is remarkable that to some extent the condition\n(4) also fixes the reference frame in the flavor space. Unitary transformations of the\nright-handed fields are in general complex and cannot be gauged away even if MR is\nproportional to the unit matrix. The matrix R can drastically reduce the hierarchy\nof the mass spectrum for the active neutrinos. So, R is observable, in principle at\nleast, if a large hierarchy of the Dirac masses is the common feature of all quarks and\nleptons. In this sense R is a physical object which is imprinted in low energy physical\nquantities, namely the masses of the active neutrinos. Unlike the quark sector with its\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix [19] the lepton sector has therefore two\nimportant matrices in the flavor space. One is the lepton mixing matrix UMNS [13]\nwhich affects the form of the weak charged current. Another is the matrix R defined\nin eq.(8). R affects the form of UMNS . Moreover, it is also reflected in the low energy\nneutrino mass spectrum. In our phenomenological approach we use the experimental\ninput to fix the form of R. One may hope that this is a first step towards an underlying\ntheory of flavor.\nWhat can be said about the matrix R? In [15] it has been shown that its element\n(R)33 must be equal to zero at the leading order. By this we mean that (R)33 cannot\nbe a number of order 1. It can be a small number suppressed by some power of the\nmass ratio of, say, m1 and m3 . Perhaps the easiest way to demonstrate that it must\nbe so is to take R = 1 which is representative for the whole class of matrices with\n(R)33 = O(1). Then for the hierarchical mass spectrum (5) a much stronger hierarchy\nis obtained for the masses of the active neutrinos\nm2\nm2\nm2\n\u03bc1 = 1 \u226a \u03bc2 = 2 \u226a \u03bc3 = 3 .\n(9)\nM\nM\nM\n3\n\n\fIt should be stressed that in eq.(9) much greater means a few orders of magnitude\nrather than factors below 10. Then for the ratio\n\u03c1=\n\n\u2206m2\u2299\n\u03bc22 \u2212 \u03bc21\n=\n\u2206m2@\n\u03bc23 \u2212 \u03bc22\n\n(10)\n\nvalues between 10\u22124 and 10\u22128 are obtained if the mass ratio m3 /m2 is taken of the order\nof the corresponding mass ratios for other fundamental fermions, i.e. mb /ms \u223c 30,\nm\u03c4 /m\u03bc \u2248 17 or mt /mc \u223c 100. These values of \u03c1 are two to six orders smaller than the\nexperimental value\n5 * 10\u22125 eV2\n\u22122\n(11)\n\u03c1exp \u2248\n2 = 2 * 10 .\n\u22123\n2.5 * 10 eV\nIn the above equation the value of \u2206m2@ from a combined fit to SuperKamiokande\nand K2K data [20] and a recent SNO result [5] for \u2206m2\u2299 are used. Before SNO, much\nsmaller values of \u2206m2\u2299 were also allowed for the oscillations of the solar neutrinos. As\nwe see, if (R)33 is not equal to zero, then an unacceptably large hierarchy appears in the\nmass spectrum of the active neutrinos. This means that (R)33 = 0 must be assumed.\nWhat about (R)23 = (R)32 ? It turns out that the resulting mass spectrum for the\nactive neutrinos is acceptable from the phenomenological point of view if (R)23 = O(1)\nis assumed. This spectrum corresponds to the case of the so-called inverted hierarchy.\nHowever in the following section it will be seen that the resulting structure of the lepton\nmixing matrix does not resemble the experimentally observed one. More precisely, one\ncan obtain a realistic mixing matrix assuming a rather artificial form of the charged\nlepton contribution VL and some sort of conspiracy and accidental cancellations. For\nesthetic reasons we do not consider such a situation acceptable and conclude that up\nto small sub-leading terms (R)23 = 0 must be assumed.\nThe only remaining case is R33 = R23 = 0 which implies\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\nexp i\u03c61\nR=\uf8ed 0\nexp i\u03c62\n0 \uf8f8\n(12)\nexp i\u03c61\n0\n0\nThe complex phase factors in eq.(12) can be of crucial importance for lepton number\nviolating processes like neutrinoless double beta decays. However, these phase factors\ndo not affect our discussion which concentrates on neutrino oscillations. So, for the\nsake of simplicity, in the following considerations we take the same form of R as in [15]:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 0 1\nR = \uf8ed 0 1 0 \uf8f8 \u2261 P13\n(13)\n1 0 0\nIt turns out that for strongly hierarchical Dirac masses eq.(13) is a necessary condition\nfor a realistic mixing and mass spectrum. Therefore we assume that some symmetry\nunderlying flavor dynamics forces UR to fulfill eq.(13).\nUnlike VR in the charged lepton sector which at low energies can be gauged away,\nthe matrix UR is imprinted in low energy physics and its structure affects the mass\n4\n\n\fspectrum of the active neutrinos in a most spectacular way. The general solution of\neq.(13) is\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03c9 1 \u03c9\u2217\n1\n(14)\nUR = R(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) \u221a \uf8ed 1 1 1 \uf8f8\n3 \u03c9\u2217 1 \u03c9\nwhere R(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) is an arbitrary 3-dimensional rotation and \u03c9 = exp(2\u03c0i/3). The particular solution in (14) has been chosen to be a symmetric matrix. One may speculate\nif this interesting matrix plays some role in the theory of flavor.\n\n3\n\nLepton mixing matrix\n\nIn this section we study the MNS mixing matrix. Following [15] we show that for the\nmatrix R given in eq.(13) the so-called bi-maximal mixing is obtained [21]. It is known\n[9] that after SNO [5] the bi-maximal mixing is excluded as a realistic description of\nthe data on neutrino oscillations. Moreover, the mass spectrum of the active neutrinos\nfollowing from eq.(13) is also not realistic because two masses are degenerate implying\n\u2206m2\u2299 = 0. Both problems are cured in the following section by adding appropriate\nsub-leading terms. Importantly, the key observation which we present here survives in\nthe realistic model. We also show that assuming (R)23 = O(1) one obtains another\nstructure of UM N S which cannot be made realistic without very artificial assumptions.\nThe lepton mixing matrix UM N S relates two sets of neutrino eigenstates: gauge\ninteraction eigenstates \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 and mass eigenstates \u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , \u03bd3 of masses \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 ,\nand \u03bc3 :\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\u03bde\nUe1 Ue2 Ue3\n\u03bd1\n\u03bd1\n\uf8ed \u03bd\u03bc \uf8f8 = \uf8ed U\u03bc1 U\u03bc2 U\u03bc3 \uf8f8 \uf8ed \u03bd2 \uf8f8 = UMNS \uf8ed \u03bd2 \uf8f8 .\n(15)\n\u03bd\u03c4\nU\u03c4 1 U\u03c4 2 U\u03c4 3\n\u03bd3\n\u03bd3\nLet O be a unitary matrix such that\nOT N O = diag(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , \u03bc3 ).\n\n(16)\n\nEq.(1) implies that ML2 = L\u2020 L is diagonalized by VL , i.e. VL ML2 VL\u2020 = diag(m2e , m2\u03bc , m2\u03c4 ).\nThen from eqs.(6)-(8) one derives\nUMNS = VL O = VL UL\u22121 O\u2032\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the unitary matrix O\u2032 is such that\n1 \u2032 T (\u03bd) T\nO m\nR m(\u03bd) O\u2032 = diag(\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , \u03bc3 )\nM\n\n(18)\n\nwith R = P13 , c.f. eq.(13). For m(\u03bd) given in (3) one obtains, see the following section\nfor a step by step derivation,\nO \u2032 = P23 U12 (\u03c0/4)\n(19)\n\n5\n\n\fwith\nT\nP23 = P23\n\nand\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n1 0 0\n= \uf8ed0 0 1\uf8f8\n0 1 0\n\u221ai\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\u221a1\n2\n\n(20)\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f8\n1\n\n(21)\n\nUMNS = VL UL\u22121 P23 U12 (\u03c0/4) .\n\n(22)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n2\n\nU12 (\u03c0/4) = \uf8ed \u2212 \u221ai\n2\n0\n\n0\n\nThe lepton mixing matrix is, cf.(17),\n\nThe presence of P23 in eq.(22) may be considered very embarrassing. Multiplying\nany matrix from the right by P23 results in exchanging its second and third columns.\nSuch an operation may perfectly ruin the structure of this matrix. Only for rotations O23 (\u00b1\u03c0/4) by \u00b1\u03c0/4 in the 2-3 plane or unitary matrices U23 (\u00b1\u03c0/4) analogous\nto U12 (\u03c0/4) in eq.(21) the exchange of the second and third column can be easily\ncompensated for by some innocent change of conventions. But these are exactly the\nmatrices which describe the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos! If\nVL UL\u22121 = O23 (\u00b1\u03c0/4)\n\nor\n\nVL UL\u22121 = U23 (\u00b1\u03c0/4) ,\n\nthe resulting UMNS can be cast in the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n1\n0\n0\ncos \u03b8\u2299\nUMNS = \uf8ed 0 cos \u03b8@ sin \u03b8@ \uf8f8 \uf8ed \u2212 sin \u03b8\u2299\n0 \u2212 sin \u03b8@ cos \u03b8@\n0\n\nsin \u03b8\u2299\ncos \u03b8\u2299\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f8\n1\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nby appropriate redefinitions of fields. This form automatically guarantees that Ue3\nis small. It is quite encouraging that the condition (23) has been realized in many\npublished models, for a review see [22]. A particularly attractive option is to assume\nUL \u2248 1\n\n(25)\n\nand to attribute the whole unitary transformation in the 2-3 plane to the lepton sector.\nThen (23) can be obtained from the lopsided form of L [23]. Eq.(25) nicely agrees with\nthe idea that the analogous matrices for up and down quarks are close to the unit\nmatrix leading to the CKM matrix also close to one.\nIn grand unified theories like SU5 , the mass matrices L for leptons and D for down\nquarks are closely related:\nL = DT\n(26)\nThis relation originates from the fact that in SU5 the charged leptons are in fact closely\nrelated to charge conjugated fundamental fermions. So, for SO10 GUTs, eq.(25) would\nimply that VR \u2248 1. However, in such theories there should be also a close relation\nbetween UR and VL . Comparing VL following from (23) for UL = 1 and UR from\n6\n\n\f(14) we do not find such a relation. From (23) we can get U13 (\u00b1\u03c0/4) rather than\nU23 (\u00b1\u03c0/4). So, we do not know how to realize the scenario described in this paper in\nSO10 unified theories.\nAfter having observed the rather miraculous way the permutation P23 leaves intact\nthe pattern of mixing, it is easier to see why an alternative matrix N \u2032 for (R)23 =\nO(1) is not acceptable phenomenologically. We can take R = P23 , see eq.(20), as a\nrepresentative for the whole corresponding class of matrices. For this choice of R we\nwould obtain\n\uf8eb 2\n\uf8f6\nm1\n0\n0\n1 T\uf8ed\n0\n0\nm2 m3 \uf8f8 UL .\nU\n(27)\nN\u2032 =\nM L\n0 m2 m3\n0\nThe corresponding matrix O\u2032 , c.f. eq.(18) would be O\u2032 = P13 U12 (\u03c0/4), leading to the\nlepton mixing matrix\n\u2032\nUMNS\n= VL UL\u22121 P13 U12 (\u03c0/4) .\n(28)\nAs opposed to the expression (22), the emerging mixing pattern is hard to reconcile\nwith data. Unlike that of the innocuous matrix P23 in (22), the effect of the matrix\nP13 in (28) is deleterious to the structure of VL UL\u22121 since it is now columns 1 and 3\n\u2032\nthat are swapped. To make UMNS\nrealistic, one would have to resort to replacing the\ncharged lepton matrix VL with a much less plausible structure.\n\n4\n\nTowards a realistic model\n\nThe central idea of the preceding sections is that the fundamental hierarchy of the\nDirac masses is drastically deformed by the matrix R. The form of R given in eq.(13)\nis particularly effective in reducing the original hierarchy. For the same reason the role\nof the sub-leading terms becomes much more prominent. In this section we show that\nrealistic models of lepton mixing and neutrino mass spectrum can be easily obtained\nwhen these sub-leading terms are taken into account. Of course there is a problem of\nthe large number of free parameters in such purely phenomenological models. Once\nagain we face the fact that the amount of experimental information is very limited.\nSo, one might argue that only more constrained models based on some underlying\nsymmetry principle can be sufficiently constrained and predictive to go beyond a mere\nparametrisation of the data. We show that such a conclusion is too strong. In fact the\nlarge hierarchy of the Dirac masses helps to reduce the number of relevant sub-leading\nterms. Then the masses of the active neutrinos can be related to \u2206m2@ , \u2206m2\u2299 and\ntan2 \u03b8\u2299 . These relations, in principle at least, can provide an experimental test of the\npicture presented here.\nSub-leading terms are introduced as small off-diagonal elements in the matrix m(\u03bd) ,\nsee eq.(3)1 . As we want to preserve the hierarchy built in the Dirac mass spectrum we\n1\n\nAn equivalent but less transparent way would be to preserve the diagonal form of m(\u03bd) and add\nsome sub-leading terms in UR , c.f. eq.(2). Small sub-leading terms in UL do not affect the mass\nspectrum of the active neutrinos. Those terms may be very important for the phenomenology of\nneutrinos because they can affect the value of Ue3 . However we have little to say about them.\n\n7\n\n\fassume that all non-zero off-diagonal elements of m(\u03bd) are small and of order m1 . Then\nthe structure of the mass operator N , see eq.(6), selects the matrix elements m13 and\nm12 whose contributions to N are multiplied by m3 and thus enhanced. Let us assume\nthat\nm13 = am1 and m12 = bm1 .\n(29)\nAs explained above the contributions to N from all other off-diagonal elements of m(\u03bd)\nare even smaller and we neglect them in the following discussion. The mass spectrum\nand the lepton mixing matrix can be computed numerically for non-zero values of a and\nb. It is instructive, however, to consider the case b = 0 which can be solved analytically\nin terms of reasonably simple expressions. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the\ncalculation of the leading contribution to the lepton mixing matrix, which was only\nsketched in Sec.3, can be obtained from the following considerations for a = 0. For\nb=0\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nm1 0 am1\nm(\u03bd) = \uf8ed 0 m2\n0 \uf8f8\n(30)\n0\n0\nm3\nand\nM = P23 UL\u2217 N UL\u22121 P23\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0 r\n= \u03bc \uf8ed r 2ar\n0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f8\n1\n\n(31)\n\nwith r = m1 m3 /m22 and \u03bc = m22 /M, where P23 defined in eq.(20) exchanges the second\nand third axes in the flavor space. For a > 0 the matrix M in (31) is diagonalized by\nT\nU12\nMU12 = diag (\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , \u03bc3 )\n\nwith\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\ni cos \u03b1 sin \u03b1 0\nU12 (\u03b1) = O12 (\u03b1) diag (i, 1, 1) = \uf8ed \u2212i sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1 0 \uf8f8\n0\n0\n1\n\n(32)\n\n(33)\n\nand tan 2\u03b1 = 1/a, which implies that\nO\u2032 = P23 U12 (\u03b1) .\n\n(34)\n\nand the lepton mixing matrix is, cf.(17),\nUMNS = VL UL\u22121 P23 U12 (\u03b1) .\n\n(35)\n\nIt should be clear from the discussion in Sec.3 that the angle \u03b1 in eq.(33) is equal to\nthe solar mixing angle \u03b8\u2299 . The eigenvalues of the matrix M are\n\u03bc1 = \u03bcr(cosh t \u2212 sinh t)\n\u03bc2 = \u03bcr(cosh t + sinh t)\n\u03bc3 = \u03bc\n\n8\n\n(36)\n\n\fwith a = sinh t. The ordering of the eigenvalues is such that e.g. the second column\nof U12 is equal to the normalized eigenvector of M for the eigenvalue \u03bc2 . This implies\nthat\ncos \u03b1 = (cosh t + sinh t) sin \u03b1\n(37)\nand\n\u03bc1 /\u03bc2 = tan2 \u03b8\u2299 .\n\n(38)\n\n\u2206m2\u2299 = \u03bc21 \u2212 \u03bc22 = 2\u03bc2 r 2 sinh 2t,\n\n(39)\n\n\u2206m2@ \u2248 \u03bc2 ,\n\n(40)\n\nThe mass splittings are\n\nwhich yields the formula for the parameter \u03c1, see eq.(10),\n\u03c1 \u2248 2r 2 sinh 2t.\n\n(41)\n\nComparison with the allowed range for LMA MSW solar neutrino oscillations [5, 9]\nleads to the following ranges for the values of a and r:\n0.35 \u2264 a \u2264 0.75\n\nand\n\n0.05 \u2264 r \u2264 0.25\n\n(42)\n\nwith the best fits corresponding to a between 0.46 and 0.57 and r between 0.09 and\n0.10.2\nEqs.(38)-(40) lead to the following approximate formulae for the masses of the active\nneutrinos:\nq\np\n(43)\n\u03bc1 \u2248\n\u2206m2\u2299 tan2 \u03b8\u2299 / 1 \u2212 tan4 \u03b8\u2299\nq\np\n\u03bc2 \u2248\n\u2206m2\u2299 / 1 \u2212 tan4 \u03b8\u2299\n(44)\nq\n\u03bc3 \u2248\n(45)\n\u2206m2@\nThe errors due to approximations leading to these expressions are small for the interesting range of a and r.\nExamine now the consequences of other perturbations of the Dirac mass matrix.\nVariation of the second important off-diagonal element, m12 , shows that for non-zero\nvalues of the parameter b, see eq.(29), the mass relations (43)-(45) are only weakly\naffected. In Fig.1 we show the test of the mass relation (38) for a few values of b.\nThe ratio plotted in Fig.1 is one if the formula (38) is exact. It is seen that corections\nfor non-zero values of b are small. In Fig.2 we show the result of the analogous test\nof the formula (43). It is clear that it also works quite well. Non-zero b affects the\natmospheric mixing angle, yielding roughly tan2 \u03b8@ \u2248 1 + b.

We think that maximal\nor nearly maximal mixing for the atmospheric neutrinos is an experimental fact which\nis too striking to assume that it is simply accidental and results from adding two\ncontributions of similar size.\nIt is worth noting that even though we have succeeded in keeping Ue3 zero, which\nis a non-trivial consequence of the structure of the lepton and neutrino mass matrices,\nit is nevertheless possible to introduce such a perturbation as to obtain any value of\nUe3 being in accordance with the present experimental data, i.e. Ue3 \u2264 0.1. This is\neffected by varying another off-diagonal element of the Dirac matrix, m21 . One gets\nan approximate relation Ue3 \u2248 m21 /m2 .\nLet us close this section with two remarks on the numerical values of the mass\nparameters in our picture. The mass of the lightest neutrino mass eigenstate, see\neq.(43), is about 3 meV for tan2 \u03b8\u2299 \u2248 0.4. This mass range can be probed by the 10t\nversion of the GENIUS project[24] if the Majorana phases are not too small and there\nare no strong cancellations between contributions to the mass parameter hm\u03bde i. As a\nfinal remark let us note that the mass scale of the Majorana masses is between 1010 and\n1011 GeV if m2 \u223c mc is assumed. It has been pointed out in [25] that this is exactly\nthe range of Majorana masses which may be important for baryogenesis; see [26] and\nreferences therein.\n\n10\n\n\f1.02\nb=2\n1.015\n\n1.01\n\n1.005\n\nb=1\nb=0.5\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\na\n\nFigure 2: Test.\u0010\nof the formula (43)\n\u0011 for \u03bc1 .

A rather small hierarchy of the low energy neutrino masses is due to\nthe symmetric unitary operator R acting in the flavor space. This phenomenon results\nfrom the see-saw mechanism and the algebraic structure of the dimension five effective\nmass operator N describing the masses of the active neutrinos. In the leptonic sector\nthere are two operators acting in the flavor space and observable at low energies: the\nUMNS lepton mixing matrix and the matrix R. The matrix R affects the form of UMNS\nand, moreover, also the low energy mass spectrum. The form of R proposed in [15]\nleads to a realistic description of neutrino\np mixing and masses. The mass of the heaviest\nneutrino is related to the mass scale \u2206m2@ governing the oscillations\np of atmospheric\nneutrinos. The masses of the two lighter neutrinos are related to \u2206m2\u2299 , the mass\nscale for oscillations of solar neutrinos and to the solar neutrino mixing angle through\nthe relation \u03bc1 /\u03bc2 \u2248 tan2 \u03b8\u2299 . The structure of the lepton mixing matrix UMNS strongly\nsuggests that the maximal or nearly maximal mixing for the atmospheric neutrinos\nresults from the charged lepton sector. Small Ue3 is obtained as a consequence of the\nmodel. The mass \u03bc1 of the lightest neutrino mass eigenstate is about 3 meV which can\nbe observed by 10t GENIUS detector if Majorana phases are not too small and there\nare no strong cancellations between contributions to the mass parameter hm\u03bde i.\n\n11\n\n\f6\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMJ is very much indebted to Frans Klinkhamer for stimulating and encouraging discussions.
