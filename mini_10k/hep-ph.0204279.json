INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Bc meson has attracted special attention as it contains two heavy quarks and its\ndecay channels are very rich compared to those of Bq (q = u, d, s) mesons. Its production\n[1], spectroscopy [2] and different decay channels [3] are widely discussed in the current\nliterature. Recently, it has been observed in 1.8 TeV pp\u0304 collisions using the CDF detector\non the Fermilab Tevatron and the values: mass MBc = 6.40 \u00b1 0.39 \u00b1 0.13 GeV and lifetime\n\u03c4Bc = 0.46+0.18\n\u22120.16 \u00b1 0.03 ps have been obtained [4]. Further detailed experimental studies will\nbe performed on Tevatron Run II and CERN LHC, which is the motivation for extensive\ntheoretical\nstudies of this system. In particular, on LHC with luminosity L = 1034 cm\u22122 s\u22121\n\u221a\nand s = 14 TeV, the number of Bc\u00b1 events is expected to be about 108 \u223c 1010 (or even\nmore) [5], so some interesting rare decays could be studied experimentally in the foreseen\nfuture.\nThe comparatively 'long' lifetime of the Bc meson is related to the fact that it can decay\nonly weakly, thus providing the rather unique opportunity of investigating weak decays in a\nheavy quarkonium-like system. Its weak decay may be due to three 'components':\ni. The b\u0304 quark decays with the spectator c quark (e.g. in the decay Bc \u2192 J/\u03c8l\u03bd\u0304l etc);\nii. The c quark decays with the spectator b\u0304 quark (e.g. in the decay Bc \u2192 Bs l\u03bd\u0304l etc);\niii. The annihilation of b\u0304 and c (e.g. the decay Bc \u2192 l+ \u03bdl , (l = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) etc).\nSometimes there is interference of two or three of the above processes in certain nonleptonic\ndecays.\nAs far as the annihilation processes are concerned, the pure leptonic decay to e+ or\n+\n\u03bc , due to helicity suppression, represents a minor fraction of the Bc full width but the\ndecay to \u03c4 does not. Whereas all the pure leptonic decays are the simplest and can be\nused in determining the decay constant fBc . Thus in fact it is very difficult to use the\nBc \u2192 l+ \u03bdl , (l = e, \u03bc) decay modes to determine fBc , but it is possible in principle to use the\nchannel Bc \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 if we have good efficiency in the detection of \u03c4 -leptons.\nThe helicity suppression can be avoided, if there is a third particle in the final state. In\nparticular, 'adding a photon' to the corresponding pure leptonic decay does not appreciably\nchange the fact that the decay ratio is proportional to the decay constant fBc , but the decay\nis changed to a 'radiative one'. The radiative leptonic decay modes Bc \u2192 l+ \u03bdl \u03b3 have already\nbeen studied using the quark models [6], light cone QCD [7] and effective field theory [8].\nIn this paper we intend to study the Bc \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 \u03b3 decay mode. This mode is of particular\ninterest because it can provide quite a sensitive test of certain theories of T or CP violation.\nSince the transverse \u03c4 polarization is proportional to (~p\u03c4 \u00d7 ~k) * ~s\u03c4 where p~\u03c4 and ~k are the\nmomenta of the \u03c4 and photon particles, respectively, and ~s\u03c4 is the spin of \u03c4 , it is an odd\nquantity under time reversal. The standard model (SM) has only negligible contribution to\nthe polarization in the decay mode1 , therefore measurement of the transverse \u03c4 polarization\nwill reveal to us possible new sources of T or CP violation beyond SM (assuming CP T\nsymmetry). Namely, many models (beyond SM) can contain certain new physical phases\nwhich induce CP violation, and measurement of the transverse \u03c4 polarization in this decay\nmode is possible (\u03c4 's lifetime in the order of 0.3ps and weak interaction decay). If a nonzero\nvalue of the polarization is observed, it will be a clear indication of the existence of new CP\nphases beyond SM. Here, as two examples to see the possibility or advantages in observing\ncertain new sources of CP violation, we consider the multi Higgs doublet model (MHDM)2\nand R-parity violation models of the supersymmetric extensions of SM, because in these\n\n1 In\n\nSM, at tree level the polarization is null.\n\n2 Sometimes people call the two Higgs doublet model as a MHDM too, but here we do not. Namely\nhere we precisely mean that there are more than two Higgs doublets in the model.\n\n2\n\n\fmodels new CP -violation phases are rich [9,12] and the transverse polarization of \u03c4 -leptons\nin the Bc \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 \u03b3 decay mode may be at tree level induced by the CP phases. Therefore\nthroughout the paper, we restrict ourselves to estimate the effects in the two models just at\ntree level.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II we obtain the transition amplitude for\nthe Bc \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 \u03b3 decay using the nonrelativistic quark model. The standard model contribution to the amplitude corresponding to W -exchange, the MHDM additional contribution\n(charged Higgs exchange) and the RPV contribution (slepton exchange) are explicitely given\nin subsections A, B and C, respectively. The formalism for \u03c4 polarization is presented in\nsection III. Section IV contains numerical results and discussions.\nII. TRANSITION AMPLITUDE FOR THE BC \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 \u03b3 DECAY PROCESS\n\nAccording to the Feynman rules for the SM, MHDM and RPV-SUSY models, the relevant\nFeynman diagrams for the decay Bc \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 \u03b3 are obtained to be just those with a photon\nattached in turn to each of the charged fermion lines of the diagrams for the pure leptonic\ndecay Bc \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03bd\u03c4 , as shown in figures 1, 2, 3-a, b, c, d, respectively. The matrix element can\nthus be written down immediately. Based on the experimental facts, in the models charged\ngauge bosonsW \u00b1 and the concerned Higgs particles or sleptons are heavy compared to Bc ,\nso we do not take into account the contributions arising from the diagrams where the photon\nis attached to the mediating charged bosons (figures 1, 2, 3-d). This is because they are\nsuppressed at least by a factor of M 2 /m2W , where M and mw are the masses of the Bc meson\nand the charged boson W \u00b1 respectively. The precise contributions of the SM, MHDM and\nRPV-SUSY models to the transition amplitude are given in the following subsections.\nA. Standard model contributions\n\nThe amplitudes arising from the Feynman diagrams figures 1-a,b,c are given as\nieGF\n6 k\u2212 6 pc + mc\nAa+b = \u2212 \u221a Vcb c\u0304 Qc 6 \u01eb\n\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\n(pc * k)\n2 2\n\u0015\n6 pb \u2212 6 k + mb\n+Qb (1 + \u03b35 )\u03b3\u03bc\n6 \u01eb b \u03c4\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\u03bd\u03c4 ,\npb * k\n\u0014\n\nieGF\n6 k+ 6 pl + ml\n\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 ) \u03bd\u03c4\nAc = \u2212 \u221a Vcb c\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )b \u03c4\u0304 6 \u01eb\n(pl * k)\n2 2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere, respectively, Qc and pc ( Qb and pb ) are the charge (in units of e) and momentum of\nthe constituent c (b) quark, \u01eb and k denote the polarization and momentum of the photon\nand pl is the momentum of the \u03c4 lepton.\nNow we use the non-relativistic quark model to convert these quark level amplitudes into\nthe hadronic level. This model was previously used by us [6] to study the process Bc \u2192 l\u03bd\u0304\u03b3.\nSince in the Bc meson both quarks (b and c) are heavy, the relative momentum and their\nbinding energy to their masses are small, so the quark and anti-quark inside the meson\nmay be treated as approximately moving with small velocity.

Figure 1-d has one more propagator of the\ncharged gauge boson W , thus the gauge violation, which originates from the ignoring of\nfigure 1-d as stated above, is suppressed by a factor of m2Bc /m2W [11].\nFor convenience, we call the first term in equation (5) as internal bremsstrahlung part\n(AIB ), whereas the second term as the structure dependent part (ASD ).\nB. Additional contributions from the multi Higgs doublet model\n\nIn MHDM, the effective scalar-pseudoscalar four-Fermi interaction can be induced by\nexchanges of additional charged scalar Higgs particles with CP violating complex couplings\nat the tree level. To be more specific, here we consider the general MHDM [12] with natural\nflavour conservation. In order to have observable CP violation, the lightest charged scalar\nparticle has to be much lighter than the heavier ones [13]. Here we assume that all the\ncharged scalar Higgs particles, apart from the lightest one, decouple from the fermions\neffectively due to suppression from their heavy masses in propagators. The Yukawa couplings\nof the lightest charged scalar to up-type quarks, down-type quarks and charged leptons are\ndetermined by the parameters X, Y and Z, respectively.\nThe fresh terms of the effective Lagrangian corresponding to the Bc \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 decay is\nGF Vcb\nL= \u221a\nc\u0304 mb X(1 + \u03b35 ) + mc Y (1 \u2212 \u03b35 ) b\n2 m2H\n\u001a \u0014\n\n\u0015 \u001b\u001a\n\n\u2217\n\nm\u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 Z (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\u03bd\u03c4\n\n\u001b\n\n(6)\n\nwhere mH denotes the mass of the lightest charged scalar particle. In the above equation\nthe term proportional to mc Y can be safely neglected: first, it is suppressed by the mass\nratio mc /mb ; second, Y is bounded to be of O(1), while X can be large [12].\nNow attaching the photon to the charged fermion lines of figure 2-a,b,c, as in the SM\ncase we obtain the quark level amplitudes to be\nA\u2032a\n\n+\n\nA\u2032b\n\nA\u2032c\n\nieGF R\n6 k\u2212 6 pc + mc\n= \u221a Vcb c\u0304 Qc 6 \u01eb\n(1 + \u03b35 )\npc * k\n2 2\n\u0015\n6 pb \u2212 6 k + mb\n+Qb (1 + \u03b35 )\n6 \u01eb b \u03c4\u0304 (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\u03bd\u03c4 ,\npb * k\n\u0014\n\n6 k+ 6 pl + ml\nieGF R\n(1 \u2212 \u03b35 ) \u03bd\u03c4\n= \u221a Vcb c\u0304(1 + \u03b35 )b \u03c4\u0304 6 \u01eb\npl * k\n2 2\n\u0014\n\n4\n\n\u0015\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere R = XZ \u2217 mb m\u03c4 /m2H .\nThese amplitudes can be converted to the hadronic level amplitudes using the nonrelativistic approximation (4) and the equation\nifB M 2\n(9)\n= ifBc M .\nmb + mc\nAgain, by adding a contact term, we obtain the total gauge invariant amplitude in the\nMHDM as\nAM HDM = A\u2032a + A\u2032b + A\u2032c\n\u0015\n\u0014\n6 \u01eb 6 k + 2(pl * \u01eb)\neGF R\nP *\u01eb\n\u221a\n\u2212(\n) (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\u03bd\u03c4 .\n(10)\n=\nVcb fBc M \u03c4\u0304\nP *k\n2pl * k\n2\nh0|c\u0304\u03b35 b|Bc (P )i =\n\nIt should be noted that the MHDM contributions only come from the internal\nbremsstrahlung part (IB) and, as in the case of SM, the diagram figure 2-d is necessary\nto ensure exact gauge invariance, but with one more propagator of the charged Higgs particle it is suppressed by m2Bc /m2H + .\nC. Additional contribution from the R-parity violating Model\n\nIn the supersymmetric models there may be interactions which violate the baryon number\nB and the lepton number L generically. To prevent the presence of these B and L violating\ninteractions in supersymmetric models, additional global symmetry is required. This leads\nto the consideration of so-called R-parity which is given by the relation Rp = (\u22121)(3B+L+2S) ,\nwhere S is the intrinsic spin of a field. Thus the R-parity can be used to distinguish the\nparticle (Rp =+1) from its superpartner (Rp = \u22121). Even though the requirement of Rp\nconservation gives a theory consistent with present experimental investigations, there is\nno good theoretical justification for this requirement; in particular, there is not very strong\nconstraint whether the lepton number L is conserved or not. Therefore, models with explicit\nRp violation (6 Rp ) are considered by many authors [14].\nThe most general lepton number, so R-parity, violating super-potential is given by\n1\nW6L = \u03bbijk Li Lj Ekc + \u03bb\u2032ijk Li Qj Dkc\n(11)\n2\nwhere, respectively, i, j, k are generation indices, Li and Qj are SU(2) doublet lepton and\nquark superfields and Ekc , Dkc are lepton and down type quark singlet superfields. Furthermore, \u03bbijk is antisymmetric under interchange of the first two generation indices.\nThe relevant Lagrangian for the decay mode Bc \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 is\nL6R = \u2212\n\n1 \u03bb3i3 \u03bb\u2032\u2217\ni23\nc\u0304(1 + \u03b35 )b \u03c4\u0304 (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\u03bd\n2 M\u1ebd2L\n\n(12)\n\ni\n\nwhere the summation over i = 1, 2 is implied.\nIt should be noted that the RP V Lagrangian has the same form as the MHDM Lagrangian except for the couplings. From equation (10) we can thus easily obtain the\n\u221a amplitude for the Bc \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03b3 in the RP V model by replacing the MHDM coupling ((GF / 2)VcbR)\n2\n3\nby the RPV couplings (\u2212\u03bb3i3 \u03bb\u2032\u2217\ni23 /2M\u1ebdLi ), as shown in figure 3a-c . We will henceforth concentrate on the MHDM only and apply the results to the RPV model with the above\nreplacement.\n\n3 In\n\nfact, to be typical we consider one slepton \u1ebd+ only for estimating the order.\n\n5\n\n\fIt should be noted that, quite similar to the case of SM and MHDM, to ensure gauge\ninvariance of the transition amplitude exactly, figure 3-d is necessary but with one more\npropagator of the slepton \u1ebd+ it is suppressed by m2Bc /m2\u1ebd+ .\nIII. FORMALISM FOR TRANSVERSE \u03c4 POLARIZATION\n\nHaving derived the transition amplitude within and beyond the standard model, we\nnow proceed to analyze the transverse polarization of the \u03c4 lepton.

However, PT as defined above is not a direct observable.

As final result, the averaged polarization is obtained\nP\u0304T = \u2212\u03c3\u0304(x, y) Im(R) .\n\n(26)\n\nIV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nHere we present the numerical analysis for the branching ratio and transverse \u03c4 polarization in the Bc \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 \u03b3 decay process with the following values: mc = 1.5 GeV, mb = 4.9\nGeV, M = 6.4 GeV, m\u03c4 = 1.777 GeV, fBc = 0.360 GeV, \u03c4Bc = 0.46 ps, |Vcb| =0.04 and \u03b1\n= 1/132.\nWe first estimate the branching ratio using equations (17 - 21). However, due to the soft\nphoton emission, the total decay width is singular when the photon energy approaches to\nzero. We therefore impose a cut value for the photon energy, which will set an experimental\nlimit on the minimal detectable photon energy. Since the photon energy Ek \u2265 100 MeV,\nwhich corresponds to x|min = 3.125 \u00d710\u22122 , we find the branching ratio in the standard\nmodel (R=0) to be\nBr(Bc \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 \u03b3) = 3.44 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\n(27)\n\nThis branching ratio may be accessible experimentally. Here we note that the light front\nmodel framework yields [17]\nBr(Bc \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 \u03b3) = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n\n(28)\n\nIf we compare equations (27) and (28), it is clear that the light cone prediction on the\nbranching ratio is approximately three times smaller than our predicted value. Although\nright now no one can tell the precise reason what makes the difference, one may see from\nthe definition of PT Eq. (22) (being a fraction) that the difference should be canceled quite\na lot in PT .\nFor MHDM, we use the following parameters from [12]. The perturbative constrains\non |XZ| and Im(XZ \u2217 ) are obtained from the decay B \u2192 X\u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 . Namely in MHDM, the\nbranching ratio for this decay mode is given as [18]\nBR\n\nM HDM\n\n(B \u2192 X\u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 ) = BR\n\nSM\n\n|R|2\n(B \u2192 X\u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 ) 1 +\n\u2212 DRe(R)\n4\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere the Standard Model result is [19]\nBRSM (B \u2192 X\u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 ) = (2.30 \u00b1 0.25)%\n\n(30)\n\nand R = m\u03c4 mb XZ \u2217 /m2H defined as in Eqs. (??). The expression for D is given in [12].\nComparing Eq. (29) with the experimental value [20]\n8\n\n\fBR(B \u2192 X\u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 ) < 4%\n\n95% CL.,\n\n(31)\n\none will obtain a perturbative constraint on |XZ| when mH \u00b1 > 370 GeV as follows\n|XZ| < min(0.32 m2H \u00b1 GeV\u22122 , 44200) .\n\n(32)\n\nThus the accordingly up-bound on Re(XZ \u2217 ) is the same as that on |XZ|.\nHowever the CP violating parameter Im(XZ \u2217 ) can be bounded from the transverse\npolarization of the muon in the decays K + \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03bc+ \u03bd\u03bc and B \u2192 X\u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 . When mH \u00b1 \u2265 440\nGeV the perturbative constraint on Im(XZ \u2217 ) is given as\nIm(XZ \u2217 ) < min(0.23 m2H \u00b1 GeV\u22122 , 44200) .\n\n(33)\n\nWith these constraint values of Eq. (32) and Eq. (33), we may evaluate the up-bounds for\nthe branching ratio and averaged transverse polarization of MHDM precisely by integrating\nEq. (17) with respect to x and y within the limits given by Eq. (16) and Eq. (26). Finally,\nwe obtain quite interesting results and put them in Table I.\nTable I.

Since the effect of MHDM in A0 (x, y) (PT = AT (x, y)/A0(x, y) in their definition)\nwas not taken into account, so such a big up-bound was obtained.\nAs for RPV, when assuming the sfermion masses to be 100 GeV the R-parity violating\ncouplings are obtained by Ref. [21]\n\n4 Here\n\nthe constraint on the parameters X, Z quoted from Ref. [12] in MHDM is very weak and\nthe contributions from the lightest charged Higgs particle, being comparatively light, are additive\nto SM, so a quite big up-bound value of the branching is obtained.\n\n9\n\n\f\u03bb313 = \u22120.003 \u03bb323 = \u22120.06\n\u03bb\u2032123 = 0.20\n\u03bb\u2032223 = 0.18 .\n\n(36)\n\nAssuming maximal CP violation further and with the couplings Eq.

The constraint\nfor MHDM Eq. (32) and Eq. (33) is very weak, but the constraint on the couplings Eq.\n(36) for RPV is quite strained and small. ii). The additional contributions from the charged\nHiggs in MHDM are constructive (plus) to those of SM, but the additional ones from the\ncharged slepton are destructive (minus) to those of SM.\nIt is interesting to compare the sensitivity of transverse \u03c4 polarization in Bc \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 \u03b3 to\nthat of the muon in K + \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u03b3. A priori we expect the polarization effects to be larger for\nBc \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 \u03b3 than K + \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u0304\u03bc \u03b3 since there are larger quark and lepton masses in the Bc case.\nFor example, the lepton polarization in these two cases may generically be written in MHDM\nas P\u0304T \u223c \u2212\u03c3l Im(R). The ratio R\u03c4 /R\u03bc is enhanced roughly by the factor Mm\u03c4 /mK m\u03bc , thus\nthe transverse lepton polarization is enhanced by P\u03c4 /P\u03bc \u223c Mm\u03c4 /mK m\u03bc \u223c 2 \u00d7 102 . The\nrather large enhancement which we generically find means that, to reach a given sensitivity\nfor new physics, we require far fewer Bc decays than K decays, although it is a great challenge\nfor experiment to produce such a great amount of Bc mesons and reject possible background.\nIn conclusion, we have estimated the branching ratio and T -odd transverse polarization\nof \u03c4 leptons in the Bc \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 \u03b3 decay in the MHDM and RPV models. It is encouraging to\nnote that the polarization effects in these models are found to be quite large. The transverse\n\u03c4 polarization observable may provide a means to look for the effects of new physics, since it\nhas received a negligible contribution from the standard model sources. Based on the above\nestimate for the averaged P\u0304T and branching ratio, we can conclude that at the level, n times\n\u03c3 (the standard deviation), and with 4% efficiency in detecting the \u03c4 lepton, the observations\nof the branching ratio and the averaged \u03c4 transverse polarization experimentally may make\nsubstantial improvements on present constraint obtained by the best observations on suitable\nobservables for MHDM and RPV, if the numbers of Bc mesons so huge as 4.3 * n2 \u00d7 105 for\nMHDM and 7.2 * n2 \u00d7 1010 for the RPV model are collected. Namely, at LHC one must\nobtain meaningful results for MHDM and RPV, even at Tevatron with RUN-II data one\nmay be possible to obtain some meaningful result for MHDM if one observes the branching\nratio and transverse polarization very carefully.\n10\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank the organizers of WHEPP-6, held at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, India, for providing a stimulating atmosphere, where B physics\nwas discussed in a working group.
