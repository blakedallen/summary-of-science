Asymptotic freedom implies that at very high baryon\ndensity, QCD is amenable to perturbative techniques [3], and since the cores of neutron stars are formed by superdense\nmatter, possible applications of those results to astrophysics [2] were envisioned. Later on, however, it was understood\nthat the ground state of the superdense quark system, a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks, is unstable with\nrespect to the formation of diquark condensates [4], a non-perturbative phenomenon essentially equivalent to the\nCooper instability of BCS superconductivity. In QCD, one gluon exchange between two quarks is attractive in\nthe color-antitriplet channel. Thus, at sufficiently high density and sufficiently small temperature T , quarks should\ncondense into Cooper pairs, which are color antitriplets. These color condensates break the SU(3) color gauge\nsymmetry of the ground state producing a color superconductor. In the late 90's the interest in color superconductivity\n(CS) was regained once it was shown, on the basis of different effective theories for low energy QCD [5], that a\ncolor-breaking diquark condensate of much larger magnitude than originally thought may exist already at relatively\nmoderate densities (of the order of a few times the nuclear matter density) and therefore it might be realized in\ncompact stars. At densities much higher than the masses of the u, d, and s quarks, one can assume the three quarks\nas massless. In this asymptotic region the favored state results to be the so-called color-flavor-locking (CFL) state\n[5], characterized by a spin-zero diquark condensate antisymmetric in both color and flavor.\nNevertheless, this picture breaks down at intermediate densities due to the mismatch between the Fermi momenta of\ndifferent quarks produced by the strange quark mass Ms and the constraints imposed by electric and color neutralities\n[6]. That is, although the validity of the CFL phase at asymptotically large densities is well established, the next\nphase down in density is still a puzzle since as a consequence of the pairings with mismatched Fermi surfaces the\nphase exhibits chromomagnetic instabilities [7].\nOne possible scenario where this instability can be avoided occurs if in the region of moderate-low densities the\nstrong coupling constant becomes sufficiently high (GD \u2248 GS \u2248 1/\u039b2 , with GS and GS denoting the diquark and\nquark-antiquark coupling constants respectively) [8, 9]. On the other hand, the increase of the coupling constant\nstrength at low density can modify the properties of the ground state as indicated by the significant decrease of the\nCooper-pair coherence length, which can reach values of the order of the inter-quark spacing [10]. As already found in\nother physical contexts [11], this fact strongly suggests the possibility of a crossover from a color-superconducting BCS\ndynamics to a BEC one [12]-[15], where although the symmetry breaking order parameter (the diquark condensate)\nis the same, the quasiparticle spectra in the two regions are completely different. As we will show by numerical\ncalculations, in the BCS region, where the diquark coupling is relatively weak, the energy spectrum of the excitations\nhas a fermionic nature, while in the strong-coupling region, formed by the BEC molecules, the energy spectrum of\nthe quasiparticles is bosonic.\nAs mentioned above, the combination of high densities and relatively low temperatures could exist in the dense cores\nof compact stars. The cores of neutron star remnants from supernovae collapse have densities several times larger\nthan the saturation density of nuclear matter and temperatures several orders smaller than the superconducting gap.\nUnder these conditions diquark pairs can form and resist the evaporation due to thermal effects. Then, it is natural\nto ask if a BEC of diquark pairs can take place at the moderately high density that the inner core of neutron stars\n\n\f2\ncan reach.\nIn this paper, we will show, through the mean-field analysis of the equation of state (EoS) of a simple system\nwith four-fermion interactions, that by increasing the diquark coupling strength the matter pressure decreases up to\nnegative values once the crossover from the BCS region to the BEC one takes place. This result would hint that if the\ndensity decreases to values where the coupling becomes sufficiently strong, the matter pressure turns to be negative\nand the system becomes unstable under the effect of gravity. Nevertheless, this is a naive picture that ignores the\ndiquark-diquark interactions. As it was pointed out in Ref. [16], together with the fact that there exists an attractive\nchannel between quarks that favors the diquark formation, there is, as a corollary, a diquark-diquark repulsion. This\nrepulsion is due to the cross-channel unfavorable correlations between the quarks belonging to different diquarks.\nHence, when the diquark repulsion is self-consistently taken into account in the EoS of this system, the instability\npreviously found in the strong coupling region is removed, and the pressure is stabilized with no significant variation\nthrough out that region. The increase of the diquark repulsion, which is produced by the raise of the energy gap in\nthe strong coupling region, compensates the effect of the decay of the chemical potential, that as known, makes an\nimportant contribution to the EoS [17]. Yet, the price of the stabilizing effect produced by the diquark repulsion is\nthat the Bose-Einstein nature of the strongly interacting system under study is lost, as we will discuss below. Our\nfinding is calling attention on one hand to the necessity of including the diquark-diquark repulsive potential in the\nstudies of the BCS-BEC crossover of strongly interactions, something that has been ignored up to now in previous\nworks, and on the other hand, it is indicating that to include the diquark-diquark repulsion can completely change\nthe understanding of this phenomenon in the context of strong interactions.\nII.\n\nBCS-BEC CROSSOVER AND QUASIPARTICLE SPECTRUM\n\nOur main goal in this section is to determine through a numerical analysis the threshold value of the attractive\ncoupling constant between quarks that marks the crossover from the BCS to the BEC region in the frame of the\nsimple model under consideration.\nFor our investigation, we consider a simplified pure fermion system represented by the four-fermion interaction\nLagrangian density of Ref. [12]\ng\nL = \u03c8\u0304(i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc + \u03b30 \u03bc \u2212 m)\u03c8 + (\u03c8\u0304i\u03b35 C \u03c8\u0304 T )(\u03c8 T Ci\u03b35 \u03c8)\n(1)\n4\nIn (1), C = i\u03b30 \u03b32 is the charge conjugation matrix, m the fermion mass, \u03bc the chemical potential defining the\nFermi energy, and g the attractive coupling constant in the J P = 0+ channel that parameterizes the strength of\nthe interaction. Varying the strength of g yields the crossover from BCS (for a weak g) to BEC (for a strong g).\nThe results we will obtain should not qualitatively change when additional internal fermion degrees of freedom, other\nthan spin, are considered. It is due to the fact that the essence of the phenomenon under investigation is uniquely\nrelated to the change in the nature of the spectrum of the quasiparticles, which is determined by the variation of the\ndiquark-pair binding energy as a function of the coupling constant strength.\nAfter introducing the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation with gap parameter \u2206 = hg\u03c8 T Ci\u03b35 \u03c8/2i, we have that\nthe system free energy at finite temperature in the mean-field approximation is\n\u221e Z\nd3 k\n\u22062\n1X\n\u22121\nT\nr\nln\n[\u03b2G\n(i\u03c9\n,\nk)]\n+\n,\n(2)\n\u03a9T = \u2212\nn\n\u03b2 n=0 (2\u03c0)4\ng\nwhere G\u22121 (i\u03c9n , k) is the inverse propagator in Nambu-Gor'kov space in the field basis \u03a8T = (\u03c8, \u03c8C ), with \u03c8C = C\u03c8\nbeing the charge-conjugate spinors,\nG\u22121 (i\u03c9n , k) = (\u03c9n + \u03bc\u03c33 )\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b3 * k \u2212 m + i\u03b35 \u2206\u03c3+ + i\u03b35 \u2206\u2217 \u03c3\u2212\n\nT\n\n(3)\n\nHere, \u03c9n = (2n+1)\u03c0/\u03b2 are the fermion Matsubara frequencies, and \u03c3\u00b1 = \u03c31 \u00b1i\u03c32 , with \u03c31,2 denoting the corresponding\nPauli matrices.

(6) and (7) to find the gap \u2206 and chemical potential \u03bc, which\ncorrespond to different values of the coupling constant g. We scale the theory parameters so to guarantee a relativistic\nregime that simulates a quark gas at moderate densities. That is, PF /\u039b = 0.3, m/\u039b = 0.2. The results for \u2206 and\n\u03bc as functions of g, in the interval 0.06 > e\ng > 2, with e\ng = g\u039b2 , and for \u039b = 602.3 MeV, are shown in Figs. 1 and 2\nrespectively. From Fig.1 we see that increasing the coupling strength, the energy gap \u2206 becomes larger. This suggests\nthat the binding energy of the diquark condensate approaches that of a Bose-Einstein condensate (with a smaller\ncoherence length \u03be \u223c 1/\u2206) at stronger coupling. To corroborate that this is the case, we should observe the behavior\nof the chemical potential with increasing the coupling strength in Fig. 2.\nAs known, the condition \u03bc < m is characteristic of a relativistic Bose gas [19]. From Fig. 2 we see that for this\nsimple model there exists a critical value for the coupling constant e\ngcr \u223c 1.1 beyond which the condition \u03bc < m is\nsatisfied. Hence, the quasiparticle spectrum corresponding to coupling constants smaller and larger than gecr should\ncorrespond to fermion-like and boson-like behaviors, respectively. In Fig. 3, we have plotted the quasiparticle spectra,\n\u01eb+\nk , corresponding to different values of the coupling constant. The gap, \u2206, and chemical potential, \u03bc, entering in\nthe quasiparticle spectrum (5) are obtained as solutions of Eqs. (6) and (7) for each value of g. From their graphical\nrepresentations in Fig. 3, we can see\np that for the spectra corresponding to ge = 0.06 and 0.9 the minimum of their\ndispersion relations occurs at k = \u03bc2 \u2212 m2 , with excitation energy given by the gap \u2206, a behavior characteristic\nof quasiparticles in the BCS regime.

Therefore, it\nis corroborated that e\ngcr is the threshold value for the BCS-BEC crossover in this model. In other words, for e\ng < gecr ,\nwe have \u03bc > m and the quasiparticles exhibit fermionic-like modes, while for ge > e\ngcr , we have \u03bc < m and the\nquasiparticles are characterized by bosonic-like modes.\nWe should underline that the obtained value of the critical coupling for the BCS-BEC crossover (e\ngcr \u223c 1.1) is in\nthe allowed range of values for the strong coupling regime of QCD, where ge = g\u039b2 is expected to be of the order\nof the quark-antiquark coupling GS \u039b2 [8]. As found in Ref. [18], once fixed the up and down quark masses with\nequal values mu,d = 5.5M eV , the four observables of vacuum QCD with values, m\u03c0 = 135.0 MeV, mK = 497.7 MeV,\nm\u03b7\u2032 = 957.8 MeV and f\u03c0 = 92.4 MeV, are obtained for \u039b = 602.3 MeV (which is the value used in our calculations)\nand GS \u039b2 = 1.835.\nIII.\n\nUNSTABLE BEC FREE-DIQUARK REGION\n\nTo find the system EoS it is needed to find the system energy density and pressure. In the case we are investigating\nthose magnitudes will depend on the coupling-constant strength. Therefore, varying the values of g from g < gcr to\ng > gcr we will be able to describe the EoS corresponding to the BCS and BEC regimes respectively.\nThe energy density and pressure are obtained respectively from the hT00 i and hTii i components of the quantumstatistical average of the energy momentum tensor. For an isotropic system, as the one we are considering, the\ncovariant structure of the hT\u03bc\u03bd i tensor is given as [20]\nT\nhT\u03bc\u03bd i = (\u03a90 + B)g\u03bc\u03bd + (\u03bcnF + T S)u\u03bc u\u03bd\nV\n\n(9)\n\nwhere V is the system volume, T the absolute temperature, S the entropy, and u\u03bc the medium 4-velocity with value\n\u2192\n\u2212\nu\u03bc = (1, 0 ) in the rest frame. In (9) we introduced the bag constant B to account for the energy difference between\nthe perturbative vacuum and the true one. In that way, we are modeling what occurs in the case of quark matter,\nwhere the asymptotically-free phase of quarks forms a perturbative regime (inside a bag) which is immersed in the\nnonperturbative vacuum. This scenario is what is called the MIT bag model [21]. The creation of the bag costs free\nenergy. Then, in the energy density, the energy difference between the perturbative vaccum and the true one should\nbe added. Essentially, that is the bag constant B characterizing a constant energy per unit volume associated to the\nregion where the quarks live. From the point of view of the pressure, B can be interpreted as an inward pressure\n\n\f5\n8\np\n\u03b5\n\np, \u03b5 [109MeV4]\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n~\ng\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nFIG. 4: Energy density, \u03b5, and pressure, p, vs the coupling strength e\ng = g\u039b2 for a free-diquark gas.\n\nneeded to confine the quarks into the bag. In the numerical calculations we will take B 1/4 = 145 MeV, which is a\nvalue compatible with that found in the MIT model.\nThen, the energy density and pressure of the system in the zero-temperature limit are respectively calculated from\n\u03b5 = \u03a90 + \u03bcnF + B,\n\np = \u2212\u03a90 \u2212 B\n\n(10)\n\nThe results for \u03b5 and p are plotted in Fig. 4 versus the coupling-constant strength ge. There, we can see that the\nsystem energy density is increasing with the coupling strength, while the pressure is decreasing up to get negative\nvalues at coupling constants corresponding to the BEC regime. The appearance of a negative pressure for the diquark\nfree gas in the BEC region indicates that the free-diquark system is unstable.\nIV.\n\nEQUATION OF STATE OF SELF-INTERACTING DIQUARKS\n\nThe system pressure decay in the BEC region obtained in Fig. 4 is an expected result since the absence of repulsion\nbetween the diquarks makes their Bose-Einstein condensation inevitable with the corresponding decrease of the matter\npressure. Nevertheless, as we will show in this section, the contribution of the diquark-diquark repulsion in the EoS\nof the strongly interacting system compensates the decreasing tendency due to the Bose-Einstein condensation and\nconsequently rendering a constant pressure throughout the strongly interacting region.\nThe modeling of self-interacting diquarks in the context of a \u03c64 boson theory was initially developed in [22] and\nthen applied to different situations in [23]. In our case, it can be achieved by introducing a \u03bb\u22064 term in the free\nenergy (2)\n\u221e Z\n1X\nd3 k\n\u22062\n\u22121\n\u03a9T = \u2212\nT\nr\nln\n[\u03b2G\n(i\u03c9\n,\nk)]\n+\n+ \u03bb\u22064 ,\nn\n\u03b2 n=0 (2\u03c0)4\ng\n\n(11)\n\nHence, the system energy density and pressure given in (10) become\n\u03b5 = \u03a90 + \u03bb\u22064 + \u03bcnF + B,\n\np = \u2212\u03a90 \u2212 \u03bb\u22064 \u2212 B\n\n(12)\n\nA possible value for the coupling constant \u03bb was estimated as \u03bb = 27.8 in [22]. It was found taking into account\nthe quark interactions in the context of a modified P-matrix formalism of Jaffe and Low [24].\nThe values for \u2206 and \u03bc obtained for \u03bb = 27.8 from the modified gap equation after including the diquark-diquark\nrepulsive interaction term\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\nd3 k\n1\n1\n2\n1=g\n(13)\n+\n\u2212 \u2212 2\u03bbg\u2206\n3 2\u01eb+\n2\u01eb\n\u039b (2\u03c0)\nk\nk\nand (7), are given in Fig. 5.\nThe repulsive interaction between diquarks makes a significant contribution to the energy density and pressure (12)\nas can be seen comparing Figs. 4 and 6. From Fig. 6, it is apparent that the instability produced by a negative\npressure in the BEC region disappears. The matter pressure now remains almost the same in the whole strongly\n\n\f6\n250\n\n\u03bc\n\u2206\nm\n\n\u2206, \u03bc [MeV]\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2\n~\ng\n\nFIG. 5: Energy gap, \u2206, chemical potential \u03bc and mass m vs the coupling constant ge = g\u039b2 for a self-interacting diquark gas\nwith \u03bb = 27.8.\n4\np\n\u03b5\n\n3\np, \u03b5 [109MeV4]\n\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n~\ng\n\n1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8\n\n2\n\nFIG. 6: Energy density, \u03b5, and pressure, p, vs the coupling strength e\ng = g\u039b2 for a self-interacting diquark gas with \u03bb = 27.8.\n\ninteracting region. In this scenario, the repulsion between diquarks produce enough outward pressure to elude the\nstar collapse. On the other hand, this same effect prevents the gas condensation into a zero momentum ground state\nat zero temperature. The fact that the diquark repulsion prevails against the Bose-Einstein condensation is reflected\nin the behavior of the system chemical potential that now can never cross the constant m line in Fig. 5. As we\nchecked numerically, once the diquark repulsion is taken into account, the condition \u03bc < m is never reached. Hence,\nthe BCS phase is maintained for the whole interaction range.\nIf one considers arbitrary values of \u03bb, one can show that if the repulsion is weak enough (\u03bb < \u03bbc = 7.65), the BEC\ndynamics can be reached by increasing g, and consequently, the system pressure becomes negative. On the contrary,\nif \u03bb > \u03bbc , the pressure is positive for the whole range of considered g-values. But in this last case one has \u03bc > m for\nall those g-values, implying the absence of a BEC region. Notice that \u03bbc is smaller than the estimated value \u03bb = 27.8\n[22]. In conclusion, we find that there is no way to put together a BEC dynamics with a positive pressure; meaning\nthat a gravitational-bound compact star cannot be formed by BEC quark molecules.\nWe should highlight that our approach is different from that developed in Ref. [22]. In our case, the diquark\nrepulsion effect is treated in the EoS as a dynamical variable, which is determined through the gap equation (13)\nand the number density constraint (7); while in [22] the contribution of the diquark repulsive potential to the energy\ndensity and pressure was modeled by assuming an ad hoc Gaussian diquark distribution for the occupation of the\nstates with momenta k > 0. In this way, it was prevented that at zero temperature the ground state of the diquark\ngas condensed in the k = 0 state characteristic of the Bose-Einstein condensation phenomenon of a free Boson gas.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND FINAL REMARKS\n\nThe goal of this paper is to illustrate the behavior of a diquark gas in the strong coupling regime. We started by\nconsidering a free diquark system. In this system we found that as the strength of the attractive coupling between\n\n\f7\n3.2\n\np [109MeV4]\n\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n2.2\n2\n1.8\n-4.4 -4.2\n\n-4\n\n-3.8 -3.6 -3.4 -3.2\n\n-3\n\n-2.8\n\n\u03b5 [109MeV4]\n\nFIG. 7: Equation of state of the strongly interacting system with diquark-diquark repulsive interaction (\u03bb = 27.8) for different\nvalues of the coupling strength ge around the critical value gecr .\n\nquarks increases, the chemical potential transits from being larger than the quark mass to being smaller, an indication\nof a crossover from the BCS region to the BEC one. A consequence of the crossover to BEC is that the matter pressure\ndecays to zero, and even reaches negative values, a sign that the BEC regime cannot be realized in the interior of a\nneutron star.\nWe then considered whether this instability could be removed by the introduction of a repulsive force between\ndiquarks. In this case, the pressure collapse can be prevented, since a sufficiently strong (\u03bb > \u03bbc ) diquark-diquark\nrepulsion will hinder the overlapping of the diquarks in the ground state. But the implications of reaching a stable\nstate in the strong diquark coupling regime is that the system maintains its BCS nature for the whole g-value range. As\nshown then by numerical calculations for \u03bb = 27.8 > \u03bbc in particular, the contribution of the diquark self-interaction\nis sufficient for stabilizing the system that then acquires an EoS stiff enough (see Figs. 6 and 7) to prevent the collapse\nthat would be caused by the formation of a pressureless gas of diquark molecules in the BEC region. The fact that\nthe diquark negative pressure prevents the formation of a Bose-Einstein diquark condensate at zero temperature in\nthe strongly interacting region is substantiated by the condition \u03bc > m for the whole interacting region. Thus, a\nself-interacting diquark system will not form a Bose gas.\nThe inclusion of the diquark-diquark negative presure in the strongly interacting system makes the EoS stiffer,\nas can be corroborated from our results. This effect can be important to accommodate quark matter into the EoS\nof neutron stars of high masses, as for instance PSR J1614-2230 [25] with an inferred value of 1.97 \u00b1 0.04M\u2299 [26].\nAs known, when quark, or other degrees of freedom like hyperons or bosons are considered, the corresponding EoS\nsoftens and it cannot support highly massive compact stars [27], unless in the case of quarks, if there exists a color\nsuperconducting phase with strong interactions between the quarks [28]. Nevertheless, the diquark-diquark repulsion\nhas not been considered in previous approaches, and its effects are worth to be investigated.\nNevertheless, we should mention that stars formed by bosons (the so-called boson stars) have been theoretically\nconsidered since long ago starting with Wheeler's notion of geons [29] (see Ref. [30] for recent reviews). A peculiarity\nof those stars is that the internal degrees of freedom are bosonic, so the mechanism to stabilize the star against its\nself-gravity cannot be through the fermionic degeneracy pressure, but by the limitations imposed by the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle for the mass and radius of the star.\nThe result we are reporting in the frame of the simple model of Eq. (1) should be investigated in more realistic\nmodels as those of Ref. [8, 9] for strong-coupling regimes. Nevertheless, we expect that the main outcome of this\npaper will remain valid. That is, the system pressure will be stabilized by the diquark repulsion. Our expectation\nis based on the fact that by increasing the coupling strength the gap will increase so as to make significant the\ncontribution of the outward pressure associated with the diquark repulsive force. A nontrivial problem that remains\nunsolved is to develop the diquark-diquark interaction from first principles. We envision that it will require to start\nfrom an extended effective theory with a higher number of fermion interactions (as for example, the eight-fermion\ninteraction model introduced in Ref. [31]) that can give rise in principle to a self-interaction term between the diquark\ncondensates. Such a study, however, is out of the scope of the present work.\nAn interesting question to be studied in this scenario is the possible effect of an applied magnetic field. As already\nestimated in Ref. [20], magnetic fields of order 1019 \u2212 1020 G can coexist in the core of neutron stars with quark\nmatter. By increasing the magnetic field strength, \u2206 increases [32], and the system is lead to crossover from the\nBEC region to the BCS one [14]. At very strong magnetic fields, when all the particles are localized in the lowest\nLandau level, only BCS diquarks are allowed [14]. On the other hand, the pure magnetic contribution to the pressure\n\n\f8\nis negative [33]. Thus, the magnetic field will have a double effect in the pressure whose consequences should be\nelucidated in the frame of the strongly interacting system.\nIn those regions of relatively low densities there is of course the possibility that the repulsion between the diquarks\ncatalyzes a phase transition to other ground state configurations such as a hadronic phase with a well identified fermion\nnature able to produce the degeneracy pressure needed to compensate for the gravitational pull. Other possibilities to\nbe investigated are the viability, through their EoS, of some inhomogeneous phases, such as those formed by density\nwaves [34], quarkyonic chiral spirals [35], inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrel state [36] or quark clusters in solid or liquid\nstates [37], that can in principle be realized in quark matter at moderate density.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work of E.
