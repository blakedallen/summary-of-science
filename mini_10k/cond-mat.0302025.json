This effect, known as the proximity effect\n[1], has extensively been studied for almost 40 years, and is rather well understood in terms of Andreev reflections [2]. On the other hand the proximity\n\u22c6 This work has been supported by Computational Magnetoelectronics Research\nTraining Network under Contract No. HPRN-CT-2000-00143\n\u2217 e-mail address: m.a.krawiec@bristol.ac.uk\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n20 July 2018\n\n\feffect between a ferromagnet (F M) and a superconductor (SC) is less understood. However recent advance in nanofabrication made it possible to produce\nhigh quality F M/SC interfaces [3] and hence there is much current interest\nin the study of the interplay between magnetism and superocnductivity in\nheterostructures involving such surfaces [4]-[9].\nIt is widely accepted that ferromagnetism is destructive for superconductivity.\nThus one expects that the proximity effect in a ferromagnet should be very\nshort ranged. Indeed, it has been predicted [10] that Andreev reflections are\nsuppressed due to the fact that impinging electrons and reflected holes occupy\nbands with different spin orientations. Surprisingly, some of the experiments\nseem to be in contradiction with the short range nature of the proximity\neffect. For instance, it was found [4] that the transition temperature Tc of the\nF M/SC multilayers oscillates as a function of the F M thickness. This curious\nbehavior has been attributed to the formation of an effective \u03c0-junction [11].\nIn general a system is in the \u03c0-phase if the SC order parameter changes its sign\nacross the junction. The \u03c0-junction behavior has been extensively studied in\nconnection with the high-Tc superconductors [12], where SC order parameter\nchanges its sign under \u03c0/2 rotation. This has tremendous consequences as it\nleads to the zero energy Andreev states [13], zero bias conductance peaks,\nparamagnetic Meissner effect and spontaneously generated currents.\nSome other experiments show oscillatory behavior of the Tc , even though a\n\u03c0-junction cannot be realized in the geometry investigated. The example is\na F M/SC/F M trilayer [6], where only one SC layer is present. Recently\noscillations of the density of states with F M thickness in a F M/SC bilayer has\nbeen also observed [7]. Evidently a conventional \u03c0-junction is also impossible\nin this case. Interestingly, such unusual behavior can be explained in terms of\na Fulde - Ferrell - Larkin - Ovchinnikov (F F LO) - like state [14], forming in\nthe proximity conditions.\nUsually, when the exchange field is increased, one would expect that either the\nfield is too weak to break Cooper pairs or it leads through first order phase\ntransition to the normal state. However as it was noted in [14], for certain\nvalues of the exchange field a new superconducting state can be realized. This\nF F LO state features a spatially dependent order parameter and the current\nflow in the ground state. The total current consists of two contributions: one,\nwhich is due to the normal unpaired electrons and the other one, which is a\nsupercurrent. These two parts cancel each other, so the Bloch theorem: no\ncurrent in the ground state, is satisfied.\nSimilarly in the F M/SC heterostructures: the oscillations of the pairing amplitude have been predicted [15]-[18] as well as spontaneously generated current in the ground state [19]. These features give a strong evidence that the\n2\n\n\fF F LO state is really realized in F M/SC nanostructures.\nIn the present paper we attempt to provide further insights into the physics\nof F F LO state in F M/SC heterostructures. In particular we investigate the\nproperties of the Andreev bound states, pairing amplitude and the spontaneous current when the temperature is varied. We suggest that temperature\nmeasurements of various experimentally accessible quantities can contribute\nmuch to the understanding of the superconductivity in F M/SC bilayers. The\npaper is organized as follows: In the section 2 we introduce a simple model\nwhich can handle the main properties of F M/SC systems. Some technical\ndetails concerning numerical implementation can be found in a subsequent\npaper [19]. In sec. 3 the nature of the Andreev bound states is discussed. We\nalso show calculated temperature dependences of various quantities characterizing our system. In particular the density of states, which can be measured\nexperimentally, can unambiguously confirm the current flowing in the ground\nstate. Finally, the conclusions are given in sec. 4.\n\n2\n\nThe model and the formal structure of the theory\n\nTo study the properties of F M/SC system we have adopted the 2D Hubbard\nmodel featuring the exchange splitting in the ferromagnet and an electron electron attraction in superconductor. The Hamiltonian is:\n\nH=\n\nX\u0014\n\ntij +\n\nij\u03c3\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1X\nUi ni\u03c3 ni\u2212\u03c3\nEex \u03c3 \u2212 \u03bc \u03b4ij c+\ni\u03c3 cj\u03c3 +\n2\n2 i\u03c3\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\n(1)\n\n~ r ), the hopping integral is given\nwhere in the presence\nof a vector potential A(~\nR\n\u2212ie\n\n~\nrj\n\n~ r )*d~\nA(~\nr\n\n~\nri\nby tij = \u2212te\nfor nearest neighbor lattice sites, whose positions are\n~ri and ~rj , and zero otherwise. The exchange splitting Eex is only non-zero on\nthe F M side, unlike as Ui (electron - electron attraction) being non-zero only\nin SC. \u03bc is the chemical potential, c+\ni\u03c3 , (ci\u03c3 ) are the usual electron creation\n+\n(annihilation) operators and n\u0302i\u03c3 = ci\u03c3 ci\u03c3 .\n\nIn the following we shall work within Spin - Polarized - Hartree - Fock - Gorkov\n(SP HF G) approximation [19] assuming periodicity in the direction parallel\nto the interface while working in a real space in the direction perpendicular.\nLabelling the layers by integer n and m at each ky point of the Brillouin zone\nwe shall solve the following SP HF G equation:\nX\n\n\u03b3\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b3\nHnm\n\u2032 (\u03c9, ky )Gm\u2032 m (\u03c9, ky ) = \u03b4nm \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\n\nm\u2032 ,\u03b3,ky\n\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\f11\n22\nwhere the only non-zero elements are: Hnm\nand Hnm\n= (\u03c9 \u2212 12 \u03c3Eex \u00b1 \u03bc \u00b1\n33\ntcos(ky \u2213eA(n)))\u03b4nm \u00b1t\u03b4n,n+1 for the upper and lower sign respectively, Hnm\n=\n11\n44\n22\n12\n21\n34\nHnm and Hnm = Hnm with \u03c3 replaced by \u2212\u03c3 and Hnm = Hnm = \u2212Hnm =\n43\n\u2212Hnm\n= \u2206n \u03b4nm and G\u03b1\u03b2\nnm is corresponding Green's function (GF ).\n\nAs usual, the self-consistency is assured by the relations determining the F M\n(mn ) and SC (\u2206n ) order parameters, current (Jy\u2191(\u2193) (n)) and the vector potential (Ay (n)) respectively:\n\nmn = nn\u2191 \u2212 nn\u2193\n\n\u2206n = Un\n\nX\n\n\u22121\no\nn\nX\n2 X 2N\n33\n(2\u03bd+1)\u03c0i/2N\n(3)\nRe (G11\n=\nnn (\u03c9\u03bd , ky ) \u2212 Gnn (\u03c9\u03bd , ky ))e\n\u03b2 ky \u03bd=0\n\nhcn\u2193 (ky )cn\u2191 (ky )i =\n\nky\n\nJy\u2191(\u2193) (n) =\n\n\u22121\no\nn\nX\n2Un X 2N\n(2\u03bd+1)\u03c0i/2N\n(4)\nRe G12\nnn (\u03c9\u03bd , ky )e\n\u03b2 ky \u03bd=0\n\n2N\n\u22121\no\nn\nX\n4et X\n(2\u03bd+1)\u03c0i/2N\n(5)\nRe G11(33)\n(\u03c9\n,\nk\n)e\nsin(ky \u2212 eAy (n))\n\u03bd\ny\nnn\n\u03b2 ky\n\u03bd=0\n\nAy (n + 1) \u2212 2Ay (n) + Ay (n \u2212 1) = \u22124\u03c0Jy (n)\n\n(6)\n\nThe details of the calculations can be found in [19].\n\n3\n\nResults and discussion\n\nSince we have determined the F M (3) and the SC (4) order parameters on\nboth sides of the interface fully self-consistently, we were able to study both\nF M and SC proximity effects. The F M order parameter (spin polarization)\nshows the usual Meissner - like behavior in the SC [19], while the SC pairing\namplitude oscillates as we increase the thickness of the F M slab [16]-[18].\nSimilar oscillations are found if we fix the thickness of the F M sample and\nchange the exchange splitting [19]. So this is the first confirmation of the\nF F LO state in F M/SC heterostructures [16,7].\nThe interesting physics of such proximity structures is the formation of the\nAndreev bound states [20]. They are 'particle in a box' like states due to the\nfinite thickness of the F M and have been discussed extensively [17,19]. For a\nnormal metal in contact with superconductor these states are symmetrically\n4\n\n\flocated with the respect to the Fermi energy \u03b5F . When the normal metal\nis replaced by ferromagnet the position of these states is shifted due to the\nexchange splitting in F M [21,17,19]. This gives a possibility to shift such\nstate to the zero energy (\u03b5F ). Of course we should talk about Andreev bands\nrather than single states because in the 2D system we are studying, there\nare the Andreev reflections for different angles with respect to the normal to\nthe interface. In such a situation when the pairing amplitude at the end of\nthe F M slab (F M/vacuum interface) is equal to zero, spontaneous current is\ngenerated [19]. The current flowing in the system produces a magnetic field,\nwhich splits this zero energy state thereby lowering the total energy of the\nsystem. If we follow the position of one particular state, forming an Andreev\nband, as the exchange splitting is increased, there is an additional (Doppler)\nshift when the current flows. The situation is schematically shown in the Fig.\n1. In 2 or 3D geometry the whole Andreev band is split. The energy of such\nDoppler splitting is determined by the vector potential and in our model is\ngiven by \u03b4 \u2248 2et\u0100y , where the layer averaged vector potential is given by\n\u0100y = \u03a3n\u2208F M Ay (n)/NF for NF layers.\nThe splitting of the Andreev bands due to the current flowing can be seen if we\nplot the surface (F M/vacuum) density of states at the Fermi energy (\u03c1tot (\u03b5F )).\nThis quantity can be directly measured experimentally using planar tunneling\nspectroscopy [7]. The example of \u03c1tot (\u03b5F ) is shown in the Fig. 2. There is\na dramatic difference between solution with or without the current (in the\nlater case the spontaneous current is constrained to be zero). In calculations\nit is readily ascertained but experimentally it would be very difficult to judge\nif there is a current or not. However a plot of the temperature dependence\nof the \u03c1tot (\u03b5F ) for fixed thickness clearly delineates this difference. At the\nthicknesses of F M for which the current flows there is a huge drop in the\n\u03c1tot (\u03b5F ) at characteristic temperature T \u2217 \u2248 (\u03beS /\u03bb)Tc , where \u03beS and \u03bb are\ncoherence length and penetration depth respectively. T \u2217 simply indicates the\ntemperature at which magnetic instability, which leads to the generation of the\ncurrent, takes the place. Such behavior is depicted in the Fig. 3 and should\nbe observable experimentally. If there is no current the DoS is due to the\nAndreev band and is almost constant (we are well below Tc ), and as soon as\nthe current starts to flow the Andreev band splits so we observe a drop in\n\u03c1tot (\u03b5F ). The important point is that T \u2217 and Tc are different temperatures.\nAs we already mentioned, the spontaneous current generates the magnetic\nfield, which can also be measured experimentally by SQUID techniques. Such\nspontaneous magnetic flux per unit area in the y direction, parallel to the\ninterface, is defined by \u03a6 = \u03a3n \u03a6(n) = \u03a3n (Ay (n + 1) \u2212 Ay (n)) and is shown in\nthe Fig. 4 as a function of the thickness of the F M sample. We see that \u03a6 is\nlarger when F M thickness is smaller and is of order of 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22121 \u03a60 , where\n\u03a60 = h/2e is the flux quantum. Moreover it seems to show an exponential\ndecay with increasing of the number of F M layers. Similarly, in this case\n5\n\n\ftemperature measurement can provide information on the existence of the\nspontaneous current. Fig. 5 shows spontaneous magnetic flux for a number of\nthicknesses of the F M slab. It is worthwhile to note that the behavior of \u03a6\nrecalls the temperature dependence of the SC order parameter in the BCS\ntheory.\nBefore closing the present discussion the following remark concerning the ferromagnet itself is in order. In general we should take into account the effect of\nthe magnetic field coming from the localized moments of ferromagnet. These\nproduce magnetic flux as well as surface currents. This effect could be important when the magnetization is perpendicular to the interface, as in our case.\nHowever if we deal with the weak ferromagnet or the sample has short lattice\nconstant, the magnetic flux generated by local moments is much smaller than\nspontaneous one, and we can neglect this effect. In the present calculations\nwe have taken the exchange splitting Eex = \u2206S /2, so this effect is of minor\nimportance.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion we have studied properties of the ferromagnet - superconductor\nbilayer. We have shown that such a structure supports Andreev bound states\nforming Andreev bands, the position of which can be tuned by thickness of\nthe F M sample. When a band crosses the Fermi energy, spontaneous current and magnetic flux is generated. We have found that the state with the\ncurrent flowing can be experimentally detected measuring the temperature\ndependence of the density of states or the magnetic flux. We have argued that\nsuch current carrying state is a realization of the F F LO state in F M/SC\nproximity system.\n\nReferences\n[1] C. J. Lambert and R. Raimondi, J. Phys. Condens.
