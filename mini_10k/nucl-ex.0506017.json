INTRODUCTION\nGRA is an element-specific, radiographic-transmission imaging technique, capable of revealing the spatial density\ndistribution of the element in question within inspected objects. The method was proposed by Soreq NRC (SNRC) in\n1985 to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a means of detecting explosives in airline baggage via\nnitrogen-specific radiographic imaging 1). Nitrogen GRA holds promise for an automatic explosives detection system\n(EDS), since high nitrogen density is a characteristic of most explosives used by terrorists, but not of commonlytransported benign materials.\nThe FAA sponsored and funded this project starting from a basic feasibility study2), launched in 1987 in collaboration\nwith Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), up to the stage of constructing a partial field-prototype inspection\nsystem. The latter underwent an extensive blind capability test in 1993 using an RFQ accelerator (to generate the\nrequisite resonant \u03b3-rays via proton-capture on a 13C target at the Ep =1.746 MeV resonance) at LANL, yielding highly\nencouraging results 3,4).\nFor this system SNRC developed and manufactured \u03b3-ray detectors with resonant response, that are selectively sensitive\nto photons in the 9.17 MeV region, which corresponds to an excited state in 14N. These detectors are based on liquid\nscintillators that contain a nitrogen-rich cocktail 5). In parallel, the LANL group developed its own GRA system based on\ncommercial bismuth germanate (BGO) detectors. The LANL prototype was tested in parallel to the SNRC prototype in\nthe above-mentioned 1993 test on the same RFQ accelerator 6). In 1994, another group consisting of a collaboration\nbetween TRIUMF and Northrop Grumman began developing a GRA contraband detection system based on segmented\nposition-sensitive BGO detectors and an electrostatic Tandem accelerator 7,8).\n* goldberg@soreq.gov.il; phone (972)-8-943 4750; fax (972)-8-943 4676\n\n\fGRA is particularly well-suited to inspection of large, massive objects (the resonant 9.17 MeV \u03b3-ray probe being highly\npenetrating) such as aviation and marine containers, heavy vehicles and railroad cars. Thus, the SNRC group reoriented\nits efforts in 1994 from inspection of individual airline passenger bags to aviation cargo containers. With the abovementioned resonant-response detectors, a prototype for inspecting an LD-3 container was built and tested in 1998, using\na proton beam from the Dynamitron accelerator at Birmingham University, England. The results of this test indicated\nthat relevant quantities of both bulk and sheet explosives can be detected against the background of diversely composed,\nhighly cluttered cargo environments 9,10,11).\nThe issue of optimal detector type for a GRA-based EDS has long been the subject of intensive debate. Many claims and\ncounter-claims have been made in favour of one or the other of the above-mentioned detector variants, but no systematic\nand comprehensive side-by-side evaluation has yet been presented. Bridging this information gap is the prime motivation\nfor the present work and constitutes its principal subject.\n\n2. THE GRA METHOD\n2.1 Physical Principles of GRA\nIn GRA the nucleus 14N is raised to an excited state by absorbing an incident photon. The cross section for excitation of a\nnucleus to an excited state ER = 9.17 MeV by absorption of a photon with energy E has a resonance behavior:\n\u03c3 ABS (E ) = \u03c0\u03bb2 g\n\nwhere:\n\n\u0393\u03b3 \u0393T\n\nEq.1\n\n(E \u2212 E R ) 2 + \u0393T 2 / 4\n\n\u0393T is the total energy width of the level; the adopted average value = 128 eV 12,13)\n\u0393\u03b3 is the partial width for the direct gamma ray transition to the ground state = 6.3 eV 14)\n\n\u03bb\n\nand\n\nis the reduced wavelength corresponding to 9.17 MeV = 2.15x10-12 cm\n2J E + 1\ng is a statistical spin factor: g =\n= 5/6\n2(2J G + 1)\nJE = 2, JG = 1 are the total angular momenta of the excited and ground nuclear states, respectively\n\nThe resonant absorption cross-section (ignoring Doppler broadening) for 14N nuclei near the 9.17 MeV level is shown in\nFig. 1, together with those for the more familiar non-resonant atomic attenuation processes (Compton and pair\nproduction).\n2 .5\n\nCross-section (barn)\n\n2 .0\n\nR e s o n a n t c ro s s -s e c tio n\n\n1 .5\n\n1 .0\n\nN o n -re s o n a n t c ro s s -s e c tio n\n\n0 .5\n\n0 .0\n-8 0 0\n\n-6 0 0\n\n-4 0 0\n\n-2 0 0\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nD e v ia tio n fro m re s o n a n t e n e rg y (e V )\n\nFig. 1: Resonant absorption \u03c3ABS(E) (square dots) and non-resonant (solid line) cross-sections for 14N at 9.17 MeV\n\n\fIn all materials the non-resonant attenuation varies very slowly with \u03b3-ray energy (by only a few % over a range of \u00b1 1\nMeV around the resonant energy). At precisely the resonance energy = 9.176 MeV, the resonant absorption cross section\nis ~5 times higher than the non-resonant attenuation cross section in nitrogen, namely, 2.4 barns/atom.\nSpecifically, at excitations in 14N above the proton separation energy of 7.55 MeV, the nucleus can decay either by\nemission of a gamma ray or by decomposition into 13C + proton. The cross sections for such reactions are, respectively:\n\n\u03c3 \u03b3\u03b3 = \u03c3 ABS (E)\n\n\u0393\u03b3\n\u0393T\n\nand\n\n\u03c3 \u03b3p = \u03c3 ABS (E)\n\n\u0393p\n\u0393T\n\nEq.2\n\nwhere \u0393p is the partial decay width for protons = 121.7 eV 12)\nIn GRA transmission imaging, the inspected object is scanned by a beam of \u03b3-rays, a fraction of which represent onresonance flux at 9.17 MeV, that is capable of being absorbed by 14N nuclei. Thus, in addition to the familiar nonresonant atomic processes (compton scattering and pair production) that attenuate the transmitted flux, such \u03b3-rays will\nundergo an additional, nuclear resonance component of attenuation that is proportional to the line-integrated areal\ndensity of nitrogen in the line-of-sight from source to detector. By measuring the transmitted flux at energies on and offresonance and normalizing appropriately, both the non-resonant (integral-absorber) and net resonant (total-nitrogen)\ncomponents of attenuation can be extracted.\n2.2 Source of Resonant Radiation\nThe ideal \u03b3-ray source for nitrogen-GRA would be one which emits photons that are all concentrated in an energy\ninterval of the order of the total level width around the 9.17 MeV 14N resonance, so that all of them undergo resonant\nattenuation if the inspected object contains a nitrogenous material.\n2.2.1 The 13C(p, \u03b3)14N reaction\nIt turns out that the \u03b3-ray source closest to the ideal is the de-excitation spectrum of the excited 14N* 9.17 MeV level\nfollowing proton capture via the reaction 13C(p,\u03b3)14N 15). This reaction is the inverse of the resonant absorption process\ndescribed in section 2.1. It occurs at a proton energy of 1.747 MeV and the thick target reaction yield into 4\u03c0 is\ncalculated to be ~6x10-9 \u03b3/proton. Since the lifetime of the 9.17 MeV level (5.1x10-18 s) is very short compared to ion\nstopping times (typically ~1x10-12 s) the emission of the gamma-ray occurs during the recoil of the excited 14N nucleus,\nresulting in Doppler-shifting of the \u03b3-ray. At the resonant angle \u03b8R = 80.66o with respect to the proton beam, the nuclearrecoil energy losses that occur during emission and absorption of the \u03b3-ray by the 14N nucleus are precisely compensated\nby the Doppler-shifted energy component.\n2.2.2 The 9.17 MeV emission line and the spectrum incident on inspected objects and detectors\nThe resonant photons are emitted with axial symmetry relative to the proton beam, forming an angular cone of width \u2206\u03b8\n(FWHM) centered around the resonant angle \u03b8R. Due to the Doppler-shift, \u2206\u03b8 is determined by a convolution of the\nintrinsic level width \u2206\u03b8nucl (\u223c0.18o) with beam and target-related broadening effects. It is precisely these broadening\nfactors that determine the suitability of a particular radiation source and detector for GRA applications. The value of \u2206\u03b8\nhas been determined by several investigators 12,14) and also by the SNRC/LANL collaboration 13). All experiments\nconsistently show that, despite employing beams of excellent quality (with respect to proton beam divergence and energy\nresolution) and viewing the emission line through a narrow collimator slit of 0.25o, the angular aperture size required to\ninclude most of the resonant photons is ~0.75o. This aperture corresponds to an energy spread of 520 eV, since the\nDoppler variation of the \u03b3-energy is calculated from capture reaction kinematics to be 694 eV/degree at \u03b8R. Such an\nenergy spread is a factor of ~4 larger than the total intrinsic width of the level \u0393T.\n\nWe shall now examine the sources of broadening of the 9.17 MeV emission line, for which the known contributions are:\n\u2022\n\nNuclear level width - 128 eV\n\n\u2022\n\nProton beam energy resolution (multiple scattering) - few eV broadening per keV\n\n\u2022\n\nProton beam optics (parallelism, spot size) - ~120 eV\n\n\u2022\n\nDoppler broadening by vibrating target nuclei at elevated target temperatures - 40 eV (300oK), 80 eV (1300oK)\n\n\fClearly, none of the above broadening factors can account for the observed 520 eV width of the emission line. Moreover,\nsuch broadening effects are typical of resonance absorption experiments populated in the (p,\u03b3) reaction, as observed on\nother levels in light nuclei 16,17). In all these cases, the broadening presumably results from atomic excitation processes in\nthe target atom that are concomitant with proton capture by its nucleus. Such combined atomic/nuclear excitations have\nindeed been observed in (p,\u03b3) reactions using proton beams with ultra-high resolution of ~15 eV 18).\nIn order to determine the incident 9.17 MeV spectrum on the inspected objects and detectors, the broadened emission\nline f(E) must be convoluted with an energy shift function g(u) representing the angular aperture, as follows:\n\n\u03a6( E ) = k\n\n\u2206E / 2\n\n\u222b f ( E \u2212 u) g (u) du\n\nEq. 3\n\n\u2212 \u2206E / 2\n\nwhere, in the present case, \u03a6(E) is the said incident 9.17 MeV spectrum, \u2206E is the Doppler energy shift corresponding to\nan angular aperture of 0.75o and k is a proportionality constant. It is assumed that g(u) is constant within \u2206E and that f(E)\nis no longer lorenzian but has a gaussian form with a FWHM of 520 eV.\nThe shape of the incident 9.17 MeV spectrum, calculated with the above procedure, is shown in Fig. 2, along with the\nshape of the absorption cross-section. As can be observed, the former is much broader than the latter. Consequently, only\n~25% of the incident photons are useful for resonant absorption.\nA bsorption cross-section\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\nArbitrary units\n\nIncident 9.17 M eV S pectrum\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n-800\n\n-600\n\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nD eviation from resonant energy (eV )\nFig. 2: 9.17 MeV incident spectrum \u03a6(E) (circles) and the resonant absorption cross-section (squares)\n\n2.2.3 Normalization procedures and 13C targets\nIn order to factor out the non-resonant attenuation for the 9.17 MeV photons, it is necessary to measure it separately from\nthe total (resonant + non-resonant) attenuation. To date, two variants have been employed for this purpose:\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nMeasurement of the attenuation at an off-resonant angle\nIntroduction of an additional \u03b3-ray line at a close non-resonant energy, that undergoes non-resonant attenuation\nonly\n\nThe first approach is the classical one and has been used in most resonant absorption experiments. However, it involves\ntwo separate measurements: at angles on and off resonance. The TRIUMF/Grumman group 7,8) developed a method in\nwhich the two measurements are performed simultaneously. This is done using a position-sensitive detector that covers\n\n\fboth the resonant and a neighbouring non-resonant angular range. Thus, one section of the detector measures the total\n(resonant + non-resonant) attenuation and another - the non-resonant attenuation. The principal advantage of this method\nlies in employing a simple thin 13C target bombarded by protons at the capture resonance that generates just the 9.17\nMeV \u03b3-ray as radiation source. The principal disadvantage is that the two measurements are performed at different\nangles, so that the resonant and non-resonant photons sample adjacent but non-identical line integrals through the\ninspected object. Hence corrections for this must be applied in the image reconstruction procedure. Another disadvantage\nis that, in order to accommodate the on and off-resonance flux simultaneously, the angular aperture of the fan beam\nneeds to be wide, with the result of \u03b3-rays being scattered by the inspected object from the non-resonant region to the\nresonant one and vice versa.\nThe second approach, employed by LANL and Soreq, is based on a simultaneous measurement of the 9.17 MeV \u03b3-ray\ntogether with supplementary radiation emitted from the target at a different energy. The principal advantage of this\nmethod is that the two radiations view the inspected object in exactly the same geometry. The principal disadvantage is\nthat, if the difference in energies is large, the factoring out of the non-resonant attenuation component is not accurate for\nall materials (notably for high-Z absorbers). Moreover, the target is more complex and the detector needs to be capable\nof distinguishing between the two radiations.\nThe LANL group used a composite 13C/19F target 6) which, in addition to the 9.17 MeV line, generates intense lines of\n6.13, 6.92 and 7.12 MeV from the 19F(p,\u03b1)16O reaction. A typical target consisted of a 150 \u03bcg/cm2 thick 13C layer and a\n65 \u03bcg/cm2 thick layer of barium fluoride, separated by a thin (40 \u03bcg/cm2) layer of hafnium. The large energy difference\nbetween the 9.17 MeV and the 16O lines can prove problematic for factoring out the non-resonant attenuation\nquantitatively, as noted above.\nThe Soreq group used a thick (50 \u03bcm) 13C target 19,20) as a source of resonant and non-resonant radiation. Such a target\nexhibits the integral yield of all nuclear reactions of p + 13C from the initial bombarding energy down to zero. The \u03b3-rays\nemanate exclusively from resonances in the proton capture reaction at different beam energies. Thus, in addition to the\n9.17 MeV radiation, this target generates a \u03b3-ray at 8.06 MeV and a continuum of \u03b3-rays from 7.5 to 9 MeV that\nrepresent a series of weaker resonances. Neither the 8.06 MeV line nor the continuum radiation exhibit resonant\ninteractions with nitrogen. This approach has the advantage of producing \u03b3-rays closer to 9.17 MeV than those employed\nby LANL, but, since the 13C layer is pyrolytically-deposited on a natural graphite backing, power dissipation, radiation\ndamage and target stability issues will require further study for eventual field systems.\n2.3 Detectors\nIn this section, we present the geometrical layout, mode of operation and calculated efficiencies for the three detector\nvariants. The efficiencies are consistently quoted for the angular aperture of 0.75o.\n2.3.1 Non-resonant detectors\nAs mentioned above, the non-resonant detectors hitherto employed in GRA were BGO detectors developed by the LANL\nand TRIUMF/ Grumman groups, each with a distinct configuration and related response characteristics.\n\nThe array of detectors in the LANL setup 6) consisted of 64 BGO detectors, each coupled to a photomultiplier (PM) tube.\nThe shape of the detector was a parallelepiped of dimensions 50 x 29 x 90 mm3 (height x width x length). A 20 mm wide\ncollimating slit is positioned in front of the array to form an aperture that corresponds to the 0.75o angular width of the\nresonant photon fan beam. The 50 x 29 mm2 detector face is presented normal to the \u03b3-ray beam, with the long (90 mm)\ndimension in the efficiency direction. Pixel size is thus defined by the detector dimensions and the slit aperture to be 20 x\n29 mm2. To assure stable operation of the BGO detectors a constant temperature is required. This was achieved by\ncooling the array with water at 17oC. The quoted average energy resolution was 15%. Such resolution is sufficient for\nadequate separation of the 9.17 MeV line from the 6.13, 6.92 and 7.12 MeV lines used for normalization. Since the\nintrinsic detection efficiency at 9.17 MeV for the above detector configuration is not quoted, we have performed a Monte\nCarlo (MCNP) calculation of the spectral response of the detector 21). The total intrinsic detector efficiency and the peakto-total (full, single and double escape peaks) ratio were found to be 93% and 59% respectively, resulting in a 9.17 MeV\nphoton detection efficiency of 55%.\nThe TRIUMF/Grumman detector 22) is made of a segmented block of BGO crystal coupled to 4 PM tubes. In this fashion\nposition-sensitivity within the block is achieved. The dimensions of the block are 50 x 50 x 50 mm3. The detector is\nsegmented by cutting the block into 12 x 12 subvolumes. This results in crystal elements approximately 4 x 4 x 50 mm3 in\nsize. The segmented block is viewed with four PM tubes, which determine the position of interaction. The energy\n\n\fspectrum is determined by summing the light from the four tubes. The quoted interaction probability, or the total intrinsic\ndetector efficiency for 9.17 MeV photons was 77% 22), however, again, no peak efficiency is quoted. Our MCNP\ncalculation for a BGO block of the above dimensions yielded a total intrinsic efficiency of 77% and peak (full, single and\ndouble escape) efficiency ranging fom 50% in the central segment to 16% in the corner segment. Inevitably, the\nexperimental peak efficiency is much worse, reflecting severe degradation of the energy resolution due to poor light\ncollection in the long, narrow crystals and variation of the collected light fraction with depth of interaction. As shown by\nthe authors, the energy spectrum is indeed strongly dependent on the position of interaction, the maximal spectrum\ndegradation occurring in the corner segment. In theory, one could collect all the events in the spectrum, that are due to\nthe 9.17 MeV interaction in the crystal. In practice, however, one has to define an event discrimination threshold as high\nas ~8 MeV, in order to prevent collection of scattered events within the larger \u03b3-beam aperture employed here. We\nestimate that the upper limit for detection efficiency (averaged over all segments) achievable here is ~30%.\n2.3.2 Resonant Detector\nIn order to single out the resonant photons from the total radiation transmitted through the inspected object, SNRC has\ndeveloped resonant-response detectors that are selectively sensitive to photons in the 9.17 MeV \u00b1 130 eV interval. The\ndetectors developed here consist of nitrogen-rich liquid scintillators (NRLS) 3,4,5), in which the incident photons react\nresonantly with nitrogen via the resonant photonuclear (\u03b3,p) reaction, the inverse of the proton capture (p,\u03b3) reaction on\n13\nC. The resulting, internally-produced 1.5 MeV proton events are detected with 100% efficiency and can be\ndistinguished via pulse shape discrimination (PSD) from the numerous electrons and positrons (leptons) produced by \u03b3rays that do not interact resonantly. PSD is based on the difference in scintillation decay times from high ionization\n(proton) and low ionization (lepton) events, which can be translated by an appropriate analog electronic circuit to time\npeaks that are separated by \u223c15 ns. Counting the proton signal provides a measure of the total transmission attenuation\n(resonant and non-resonant). The non-resonant attenuation is determined in a simultaneous measurement, by counting\nthe lepton signal.\n\nThe NRLS has a density of \u03c1T = 0.9 g/cm3 and its nitrogen content is 30% by weight, so that the nitrogen density is \u03c1N =\n0.27 g/cm3. The detector consists of a pyrex vessel of parallelepiped shape, filled with the liquid, 20 x 20 x 240 mm3 in\ndimensions. The vessel is coupled via a parabolic perspex light-guide to a 50.8 mm PM tube and the entire assembly is\nenclosed by a light-tight cover. The 20 x 20 mm2 detector face is presented normal to the \u03b3-ray beam, forming a pixel of\nthese dimensions, with the long (240 mm) dimension in the efficiency direction. The detector array for the 1998 LD-3\ncontainer test consisted of 61 such detectors.\nFig. 3 shows a two-dimensional (scintillation decay-time vs. pulse-height) spectrum obtained using the resonant detector\nirradiated by 9.17 MeV photons on and off the resonant angle.\n\nFig. 3: Two-dimensional display of the resonant NRLS detector response to 9.17 MeV \u03b3-rays, on and off the resonant angle.\n\nOne can observe from Fig. 3 that the 1.5 MeV proton events created in the 14N(\u03b3,p)13C reaction by resonant photons are\nvery well separated from the continuum of leptons created by all photons in the incident spectrum. By electronically\nselecting a two-dimensional region of interest around the proton peak one can count the proton events only, with\n\n\fa signal- to-background ratio (for proton to lepton events) exceeding 15:1. The lepton events which determine the nonresonant attenuation are counted in a separate channel above a 3.5 Mev pulse-height threshold.\nThe response of the resonant detector to photons is energy-dependent and its resonant efficiency is represented by:\neff R (E ) =\n\n\u03bc \u03b3p (E) \u03c1 N\n\u03a3 T (E)\n\n[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03a3 T (E) d)]\n\nEq. 4\n\nwhere \u03bc\u03b3p(E) is the mass attenuation cross section for the (\u03b3,p) reaction in the detector, \u03a3T(E) = \u03bc\u03b3p(E) \u03c1N+ \u03bcNR \u03c1T is the\ntotal macroscopic cross-section for interaction of the 9.17 MeV photons in the detector medium, \u03bcNR is the conventional\nmass attenuation coefficient and d is the length of the detector (24 cm).\nFig. 4 shows the detection efficiency of the NRLS resonant detector as function of \u03b3-ray energy. As can be observed, the\nefficiency is relatively high (40%) at resonance and decreases rapidly as the energy deviates from the resonant energy.\nThe efficiencies of the LANL and TRIUMF/Grumann BGO detectors are shown here for comparison.\n0.8\n0.7\n\nLANL Detector\n\nDetection Efficiency\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\nTRIUMF Detector\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-800\n\nSNRC Detector\n\n-600\n\n-400\n\n-200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nDeviation from resonant energy (eV)\n\nFig. 4: Intrinsic detection efficiency for LANL BGO, TRIUMF/Grumman BGO and SNRC NRLS detectors\n\n3. COMPARISON OF DETECTORS\nIn this section, we present intrinsic figures-of-merit (F.O.M's) for evaluating and comparing the single-pixel\nperformance of the three detector variants. These F.O.M's are consistently quoted for the relevant angular aperture of\n0.75o.\nSpecifically, when comparing relative merits of GRA detectors with resonant and non-resonant response, it is important\nto take into consideration how each of these detectors responds to the incident radiation, how well it singles out the\nresonant photon events that carry the nitrogen attenuation information and rejects non-resonant photon events that carry\nonly the atomic attenuation information. Once this has been clarified, it is relatively easy to define a first-order F.O.M.\nBy first order, we refer to the approximation that there are no artifacts of any of the following types:\n\u2022\n\nEnergy dependent normalization\n\n\u2022\n\nSpatial sampling\n\n\u2022\n\nImage noise of any kind except Poisson counting statistics\n\n\u2022\n\nNon-resonant forward-scattered radiation in the transmission image\n\n\fIn this approximation, the F.O.M is defined in Eq. 5 below. It represents a single-pixel measure for statistical\nsignificance of GRA data and thus has a direct bearing on the throughput, probability of detection and false alarm rate\nachievable with the detector.\n\nF .O.M = Contrast_sensitivity \u22c5 Number_of_detected_events\n\nEq. 5\n\nBy Contrast_sensitivity is meant the measured net resonant attenuation per g/cm2 of nitrogen traversed in the inspected\nobject (essentially, the mean resonant attenuation coefficient). The Number_of_detected_events is defined as number of\ndetected 9.17 MeV events per given incident photon intensity \u03a6(E). From Eq. 5 it is clear that the Contrast_sensitivity\nhas a greater effect on the F.O.M than the Number_of_detected_events.\nTable I below presents the analytical expressions for the above parameters. The Contrast_sensitivity expressions are\ngiven here for a thin nitrogenous absorber, i.e., taking a linearized approximation of the exponential resonant attenuation.\nSuch an approximation is reasonable since, in most operational scenarios, the nitrogen thickness traversed does not\nexceed ~3g/cm2. \u03bcA(E) is the mass resonant attenuation of nitrogen defined as: \u03bcA(E) = \u03c3ABS(E) x NAVOGADRO /14. All\nother values have been defined previously.\nTable 1.

We have calculated the Contrast_sensitivity for\nboth types of detectors by evaluating the integrals numerically, using \u03a6(E) determined in section 2.2.2, i.e.,\ncorresponding to an intrinsic emission line width of 520 eV and a collimator aperture of 0.75o. The resulting calculated\nContrast_sensitivities were 0.025 and 0.058 cm2/g for the LANL non-resonant and SNRC NRLS resonant detectors,\nrespectively. These agree with the experimental values of 0.026 23) and 0.054 3) respectively, obtained with electrostatic\naccelerators for similar collimator apertures.\nIn general, it is to be noted that any degradation in target or accelerator beam quality will have more severe consequences\nfor the F.O.M's of non-resonant detectors than for those of resonant detectors. Thus, for the resonant detector, the\nContrast_sensitivity is invariant to such changes, whereas the Number_of_detected_events will decrease in proportion to\nthe emission-line broadening. In comparison, for the non-resonant detector, the Contrast_sensitivity will decrease in\nproportion to the beam and target related emission-line broadening, whereas the Number_of_detected_events will remain\ninvariant. Indeed, the experimental evidence is that the Contrast_sensitivity of the LANL BGO detector obtained with an\nRFQ accelerator beam of ~20 keV FWHM energy resolution was reduced from 0.026 to 0.015 cm2/g 23).\nFor a quantitative evaluation of the influence of the accelerator/target-induced incident line broadening we have\ncalculated the Contrast_sensitivity for non-resonant and resonant detectors, treating the intrinsic emission linewidth (f(E)\nof Eq.3) FWHM as a parameter. Fig. 5 shows the Contrast_sensitivity for resonant and non-resonant detectors vs. the\nFWHM of the intrinsic emission line. In all cases the collimator aperture was maintained at 0.75o.\n\n\fFig. 5: Non-resonant and resonant detector Contrast_sensitivity vs the FWHM width of the intrinsic emission line\n\nFig. 5 clearly shows that the non-resonant detector is inherently more sensitive to changes in the width of the emission\nline than the resonant detector. For example, if the emission line is broadened to 1100 eV, the resonant detector\nContrast_sensitivity becomes 3.6 times higher than that of its non-resonant counterpart.\nObviously, the next step is to perform the comparison between non-resonant and resonant detectors at the level of the\nF.O.M itself. To this end, we have calculated the F.O.M for each detector vs the angular aperture of the collimator. As\nthe aperture size varies, the two types of detector will respond differently. Fig 6 shows the F.O.M ratios for an NRLS\nresonant detector to a non-resonant detector of LANL and TRIUMF/Grumman design, as function of collimator aperture.\n\nFig. 6: F.O.M ratios of the SNRC resonant detector to the LANL (diamonds) and TRIUMF/Grumman (squares) detectors\n\nFig. 6 shows that the ratio of single-pixel F.O.M for the SNRC NRLS resonant and LANL-BGO non-resonant detectors\nis approximately unity at an angular aperture of 0.75o, indicating that, from a purely statistical point of view, the\nperformance of these two detectors is comparable. In contrast, the performance of the resonant detector is clearly\nsuperior to that of the TRIUMF/Grumman non-resonant detector at all aperture sizes.\n\n\f4. CONCLUSIONS\nA clear-cut conclusion is that resonant-response detectors invariably exhibit higher Contrast_sensitivity than their nonresonant counterparts. Typically, the latter is at least a factor of ~2.5 higher for NRLS than for BGO. This feature of\nNRLS unequivocally renders it the detector of choice when small quantities of explosives need to be detected. This type\nof detector is also free of normalization and target stability problems. Its main shortcoming is relatively low efficiency,\nsince it has hitherto proved difficult to load more than ~30% nitrogen (weight per weight) into the active medium\nwithout impairing PSD performance by scintillation quenching.\nAnother conclusion is that, from a purely statistical point of view, the performances of NRLS and LANL-BGO detectors\nare comparable. However, this is valid only to the extent that the GRA data and images do not exhibit noise or artifacts\nof any kind except Poisson counting statistics. Not surprisingly, under real measuring conditions, one does expect (and\nindeed experimentally observes 22)) additional sources of data and image noise, that are not entirely reflected in the\nsingle-pixel F.O.M's. Prominent among these are:\n\n\u2022\n\ndegradation or instability of accelerator beam quality (primarily with respect to beam energy resolution, spot\nsize and optics at target)\n\n\u2022\n\ntarget deterioration under protracted beam bombardment\n\n\u2022\n\nlow-angle \u03b3-ray scattering (highly significant when scanning massive, low-Z objects)\n\nThe first two of these artifacts clearly degrade BGO data more severely than NRLS data. This is inherent in the resonant\nvs. non-resonant response. With respect to the third, there is no marked preference for one detector type over another,\nexcept that the TRIUMF/Grumman BGO variant appears somewhat more vulnerable than the other two. Essentially, the\nproblem needs to be tackled by ensuring stringent pre-collimation of the \u03b3-ray fan-beam.\nA further conclusion is that NRLS is superior to the TRIUMF/Grumman detector at any aperture size (see Fig. 6). The\ndominant factor here is the relatively low photopeak efficiency that characterizes a segmented BGO detector. Another\nproblem that is particularly severe with this detector is the influence of the low angle \u03b3-ray scattering by the object from\nthe non-resonant angle region to the resonant angle, which further reduces the resonant contrast.\nIn summary, we conclude that resonant detectors provide a considerably greater margin of sensitivity. They are also less\ndependent on accelerator beam quality and their lower detection efficiency is offset by the higher Contrast_sensitivity.\nMoreover, although not yet commercially available, NRLS detectors are markedly cheaper than BGO detectors.\nFinally, it should be borne in mind that the performance of an eventual field EDS based on GRA will also reflect factors\nthat cannot entirely be incorporated within the single-pixel F.O.M developed and discussed here. These pertain\nprimarily to issues of image quality and the specific mode of inspection implemented (single-view or few-view\nradiography, few-view or multi-view tomography). They will be dealt with in a separate publication.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
