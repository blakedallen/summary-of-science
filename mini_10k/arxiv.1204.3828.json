Such processes\nhave provided a direct probe of hard subprocess dynamics, since the produced photons are\nlargely insensitive to the effects of final-state hadronization. Inclusive prompt photon cross\nsections are strongly sensitive to the parton content of a proton since, at leading order\n(LO) of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), such photons are produced mainly via quarkgluon Compton scattering or quark-antiquark annihilation. An additional information about\ninteraction can be extracted from the photon and associated jet production cross sections\nif flavor of the produced jets is tagged. Such measurements have been performed recently\nby the D\u2205 [1, 2] and CDF [3, 4] collaborations at the Tevatron where \u03b3 + c-jet and \u03b3 + bjet production cross sections as a function of photon transverse momentum p\u03b3T have been\nreported. The perturbative QCD predictions [7] calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO)\nagree reasonably well with the measured cross sections at relatively low p\u03b3T values, up to\np\u03b3T \u223c 70 GeV. However, the substantial disagreement between theory and data for both\n\u03b3 + b-jet and \u03b3 + c-jet production at large p\u03b3T was observed [1\u20133]. In the present note we will\nanalyse recent D\u2205 [1,2] and CDF [3,4] data as well as previous CDF measurements [5,6] using\nthe kT -factorization approach of QCD [8]. This approach has been successfully applied by us,\nin particular, to heavy flavour production [9] and inclusive prompt photon production [10\u201313]\nat the HERA, Tevatron and LHC energies2 . An additional motivation for our study is that\nsuch processes are background processes for the physics beyound the Standard Model (SM),\nfor example the production of excited quarks or gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking\nwith neutralinos radiatively decaying to gravitinos [15], and, therefore, it is necessary to have\na realistic estimations of corresponding cross sections within QCD.\nFirst application of kT -factorization approach to production of photons associated with\nthe charm or beauty quarks have been performed in our previous paper [16]. The consideration was based on the O(\u03b1\u03b1s2 ) amplitude for the production of a single photon associated with\na quark pair in the fusion of two off-shell gluons g \u2217 g \u2217 \u2192 \u03b3QQ\u0304 (see Fig. 1a). A reasonably\ngood agreement between the numerical predictions and the Tevatron data [5,6] was obtained\nin the region of relatively low p\u03b3T where off-shell gluon fusion dominates. However, the quarkinduced subprocesses become more important at moderate and large p\u03b3T and therefore should\nbe taken into account. In the present note we extend our previous predictions [15] by including into the consideration two additional O(\u03b1\u03b1s2 ) subprocesses, namely q \u2217 q\u0304 \u2217 \u2192 \u03b3QQ\u0304\n(Fig. 1b) and q \u2217 (q\u0304 \u2217 )Q \u2192 \u03b3q(q\u0304)Q (Fig. 1c), where Q is the charm or beauty quark. These\nsubprocesses give a sizeble contribution in the p\u03b3T region probed by measurements [1\u20134]. In\nother aspects we follow the approach described in [16]. Our main goal is to give a systematic\nanalysis of available D\u2205 and CDF data [1\u20136] in the framework of kT -factorization. Specially\nwe study different sources of theoretical uncertainties. Such calculations are performed for\nthe first time.\nLet us start from a very short review of calculation steps. We describe first the evaluation\nof the off-shell q \u2217 q\u0304 \u2217 \u2192 \u03b3QQ\u0304 and q \u2217 (q\u0304 \u2217 )Q \u2192 \u03b3q(q\u0304)Q production amplitudes. We denote the\n4-momenta of incoming quarks, produced photon and outgoing quarks by k1 , k2 , p, p1 and\np2 , respectively; and polarization 4-vector of produced prompt photon is given by \u01eb.

However, in the\ncase of initial off-shell quarks on-shell quark spin density matrix has to be replaced by a\nmore complicated expression3 . To evaluate it we follow a simple approximation proposed\nin [10]. We extend the original diagram and consider the off-shell quark line as internal line\nin the extended diagram. The extended process looks like follows: the initial on-shell quark\nwith 4-momentum p and mass m radiates a quantum (say, photon or gluon) and becomes\nan off-shell quark with 4-momentum k. So, for the extended diagram squared we can write:\n\"\n\n#\n\nk\u0302 + m \u03bd\nk\u0302 + m\n|M| \u223c tr T\u0304 2\n\u03b3\nu(p)\u016b(p)\n\u03b3\nT\u03bc ,\n\u03bd\nk \u2212 m2\nk 2 \u2212 m2\n2\n\n\u03bc\n\n(11)\n\nWe neglected virtualities of incoming heavy quarks in q \u2217 (q\u0304)Q \u2192 \u03b3q(q\u0304)Q amplitude and treat them as\non-shell.\n3\n\n3\n\n\fwhere T is the rest of the original matrix element. The expression presented between T\u0304 \u03bc\nand T\u03bc now plays the role of the off-shell quark spin density matrix. Using the standard\nP\non-shell condition u(p)\u016b(p) = p\u0302 + m and performing the Dirac algebra one obtains in the\nmassless limit m \u2192 0:\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011 i\n2\n(12)\n|M|2 \u223c 2 2 tr T\u0304 \u03bc k 2 p\u0302 \u2212 2(p * k)k\u0302 T\u03bc .\n(k )\nNow, using the Sudakov decomposition k = xp + kT (where kT is the off-shell quark non-zero\ntransverse 4-momentum, k 2 = kT2 = \u2212k2T ) and neglecting the second term in the parentheses\nin (12) in the small-x limit, we easily obtain:\nh\ni\n2\n|M|2 \u223c 2 tr T \u0304 \u03bc xp\u0302T\u03bc .\n(13)\nxk\nEssentially, we have neglected here the negative light-cone momentum fraction of the incoming quark. The properly normalized off-shell spin density matrix is given by xp\u0302, while the\nfactor 2/xk 2 has to be attributed to the quark distribution function (determining its leading\nbehavior). With this normalization, we successfully recover the on-shell collinear limit when\nk is collinear with p.\nFurther calculations are straighforward and in other respects follow the standard QCD\nFeynman rules4 . The evaluation of traces was done using the algebraic manipulation system\nform [17]. We do not list here the obvious expressions because of lack of space. The analytic\nexpression for the |M\u0304|2 (g \u2217 g \u2217 \u2192 \u03b3QQ\u0304) has been derived in our previous paper [12].\nAccording to the kT -factorization theorem, to calculate the cross section of any process\none should convolute the off-shell partonic cross sections with the corresponding unintegrated\n(dependent from the transverse momenta) quark and/or gluon distributions in a proton:\n\u03c3=\n\nX Z\n\n\u03c3\u0302ij\u2217 (x1 , x2 , k21T , k22T ) fi (x1 , k21T , \u03bc2 )fj (x2 , k22T , \u03bc2 )\u00d7\n\ni,j=q, g\n\n(14)\nd\u03c61 d\u03c62\n,\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0\nwhere \u03c3\u0302ij\u2217 (x1 , x2 , k21T , k22T ) \u223c |M\u03042ij (k21T , k22T )| \u2297 d\u03a6 is the relevant off-shell partonic cross section and incoming partons have fractions x1 and x2 of initial protons longitudinal momenta,\ntransverse momenta k1T and k2T and azimuthal angles \u03c61 and \u03c62 .

It is because after applying\nthe isolation cut (see [1\u20136]) these contributions amount only to about 10% of the visible cross section. The\nisolation requirement and additional conditions which preserve our calculations from divergences have been\nspecially discussed in [12].\n\n4\n\n\f\u03c3qq\u0304 =\n\nXZ\nq\n\n1\n256\u03c0 3 (x1 x2 s)2\n\n|M\u0304(q \u2217 q\u0304 \u2217 \u2192 \u03b3QQ\u0304)|2 \u00d7\n\n(17)\nd\u03c62 d\u03c81 d\u03c82\n,\n2\u03c0 2\u03c0 2\u03c0 2\u03c0\nwhere y is the rapidity of the produced prompt photon, p1T , p2T , y1 , y2 , \u03c81 and \u03c82 are\nthe transverse momenta, rapidities and azimuthal angles of final state quarks, respectively.\nSimilar expression can be easily written for q \u2217 (q\u0304 \u2217 )Q \u2192 \u03b3q(q\u0304)Q contribution. If we average (16) and (17) over \u03c61 and \u03c62 and take the limit k21T \u2192 0 and k22T \u2192 0, then we recover\ncorresponding expressions of usual collinear QCD approximation.\nConcerning the unintegrated quark and gluon densities in a proton, we apply the KimberMartin-Ryskin (KMR) approach [18] to calculate them. The KMR approach is the formalism\nto construct the unintegrated parton distributions from the known conventional ones. In this\ncase the unintegrated quark and gluon distributions are given by\nd\u03c61\n\u00d7fq (x1 , k21T , \u03bc2 )fq (x2 , k22T , \u03bc2 )dk21T dk22T dp21T p22T dydy1dy2\n\n\u03b1s (k2T )\n\u00d7\n2\u03c0\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nZ1\nx x 2\nx x 2\n\u00d7 dz Pqq (z) q\n, k \u0398 (\u2206 \u2212 z) + Pqg (z) g\n,k\n,\nz\nz T\nz\nz T\nx\n\n(18)\n\n\u03b1s (k2T )\n\u00d7\n2\u03c0\n#\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ1\nX\nx x 2\nx x 2\n, kT + Pgg (z) g\n, kT \u0398 (\u2206 \u2212 z) ,\nPgq (z) q\n\u00d7 dz\nz\nz\nz\nz\nq\nx\n\n(19)\n\nfq (x, k2T , \u03bc2 ) = Tq (k2T , \u03bc2 )\n\nfg (x, k2T , \u03bc2 ) = Tg (k2T , \u03bc2)\n\nwhere Pab (z) are the usual unregulated LO DGLAP splitting functions. The theta functions\nwhich appears in (18) and (19) imply the angular-ordering constraint \u2206 = \u03bc/(\u03bc + |kT |)\nspecifically to the last evolution step to regulate the soft gluon singularities. Numerically, for\nthe input we have used LO parton densities xq(x, \u03bc2 ) and xg(x, \u03bc2 ) from recent MSTW'2008\nset [19].\nOther essential parameters were taken as follows: renormalization and factorization scales\n\u03bc = \u03bep\u03b3T (where we vary the parameter \u03be between 1/2 and 2 about the default value \u03be = 1\nin order to estimate the scale uncertainties of our calculations), LO formula for the strong\ncoupling constant \u03b1s (\u03bc2 ) with nf = 4 and \u039bQCD = 200 MeV, such that \u03b1s (MZ2 ) = 0.1232.\nWe set the charm and beauty quark masses to mc = 1.5 GeV and mb = 4.75 GeV. The\nmultidimensional integration has been performed by means of the Monte Carlo technique,\nusing the routine vegas [20]. The full C++ code is available from the authors on request5 .\nWe now are in a position to present our predictions. In Figs. 2 - 5 we confront the\ncalculated \u03b3 + b-jet differential cross sections as a function of photon\u221a\ntransverse momentum\nwith the recent data [1\u20134] taken by the D\u2205 and CDF collaborations at s = 1960 GeV. These\ndata refer to the central kinematic region for heavy quark jet, and the D\u2205 measurements [2]\nhave been performed in two regions of kinematics, defined by y \u03b3 y jet > 0 and y \u03b3 y jet < 0. For\ncomparison we also plot the NLO QCD predictions [7] taken from [1\u20134]. We find that the full\nset of experimental data are reasonably well described by the kT -factorization approach. One\n5\n\nlipatov@theory.sinp.msu.ru\n\n5\n\n\fcan see that the shape and absolute normalization of measured cross sections are adequately\nreproduced. The overall agreement of our predictions and the data at moderate p\u03b3T is on\nthe same level as it was achieved in the framework of NLO QCD approximation, and the\ndifference appears at small and large p\u03b3T (see Figs. 2, 4 and 5). However, in the case of\n\u03b3 + c-jet production, the situation is a bit worse: we find a substantial disagreement between\nour predictions and D\u2205 data at high p\u03b3T (see Fig. 6). As it was noted in [2], the disagreement\ncan be reduced if, in particular, additional contributions involving intrinsic charm [21] are\ntaken into account. The consideration of such contributions is out of our paper. Note,\nhowever, that very recent CDF data [3] for \u03b3 + c-jet production are well described by the\nkT -factorization in a whole pT range (see Fig. 7).\nThe relative contributions of g \u2217 g \u2217 \u2192 \u03b3QQ\u0304 and q \u2217 (q\u0304 \u2217 )Q \u2192 \u03b3q(q\u0304)Q are approximately\nequal to each other in the considered kinematical region. These subprocesses give a main\ncontribution to the cross section up to p\u03b3T \u2243 60 GeV. At higher photon transverse momenta\nthe q \u2217 q\u0304 \u2217 \u2192 \u03b3QQ\u0304 subprocess dominates. The scale uncertainties of our calculations at high\nand low p\u03b3T are defined by uncertainties of corresponding leading production mechanisms\nand connected, in particular, with the unintegrated gluon and quark densities at low and\nhigh x.\nThe CDF collaboration have reported data [5,6] which refer to the muons which originate\nfrom the semileptonic decays of associated charmed or beauty quarks. These measurements\n\u03bc\n\u03b3\n\u03bc\nhave\n\u221a been performed in the kinematic region defined by |\u03b7 | < 0.9, pT > 4 GeV and |\u03b7 | < 1\nat s = 1800 GeV. To produce muons from charmed and beauty quarks, we first convert\nthem into a D or B hadrons using the Peterson fragmentation function [22] and then simulate their semileptonic decay according to the standard electroweak theory. Additionally, the\ncascade decays b \u2192 c \u2192 \u03bc have been taken into account. We set the fragmentation parameters \u01ebc = 0.06 and \u01ebb = 0.006 and corresponding branching fractions to f (c \u2192 \u03bc) = 0.0969,\nf (b \u2192 \u03bc) = 0.1071 and f (b \u2192 c \u2192 \u03bc) = 0.0802 [23]. Our predictions for \u03b3 + \u03bc cross sections\nas a functions of transverse momentum p\u03b3T and azimuthal angle difference \u2206\u03c6 (i.e. difference\nbetween the produced photon and muon transverse momenta) are shown in Figs. 8 and 9.\nWe find that the kT -factorization predictions slightly overestimate the measured transverse\nmomentum distributions but agree with data within the uncertainties.\nObtained perfect description of the \u2206\u03c6 distribution is notable. The important role of such\nobservables for understanding an interaction dynamics is well known6 . In particular, they\ngive an additional insight into the effective contributions from higher-order QCD processes.\nIn the naive LO QCD approximation, the distribution over \u2206\u03c6 must be simply a delta\nfunction \u03b4(\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c0) since the produced particles are back-to-back in the transverse plane and\nare balanced in pT due to momentum conservation. When higher-order QCD processes are\nconsidered, the presence of additional quarks and/or gluons in the final state allows the \u2206\u03c6\ndistribution to be more spread. In the kT -factorization approach, taking into account the\nnon-vanishing initial parton transverse momentum kT leads to the violation of back-to-back\nkinematics even at leading order. Despite the fact that using the 2 \u2192 3 matrix elements in\nour consideration instead the 2 \u2192 2 ones makes the difference between the kT -factorization\npredictions and the collinear approximation of QCD not well pronounced, the CDF data\nclearly favour the kT -factorization results.\n6\n\nSee, for example, [14].\n\n6\n\n\fNow we can try to extend our predictions to LHC energies. As a representative example,\nwe define the kinematical region by the requirements |y \u03b3 | < 2.5, 25 < p\u03b3T < 400 GeV,\n|y jet| < 2.2 and 18 < pjet\nT < 200 GeV. Such region is coincide with one defined in recent\nanalyses performed by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations [24, 25]. Our predictions for\ndifferential \u03b3 + b-jet cross sections as a function of photon transverse momentum\np\u03b3T and\n\u221a\nrapidity y \u03b3 are shown in Fig. 10. The corresponding experimental data at s = 7 TeV are\nstill waited.\nTo conclude, in the present note we apply the kT -factorization approach to the analysis of recent CDF and D0 experimental data on the associated photon and heavy quark\nproduction. Using the off-shell (kT -dependent) matrix elements of gluon-gluon fusion and\nquark-(anti)quark interaction subprocesses, we obtained a good agreement between our predictions and the Tevatron data. As it was noted in [1], our results agree better with the\nTevatron data than the NLO QCD ones. It is important for further studies of small-x\nphysics, and, in particular, for searches of effects of new physics beyond the SM at modern\nhadron colliders.\nAcknowledgements.
