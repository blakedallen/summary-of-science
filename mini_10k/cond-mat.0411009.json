However, even the closed shell\nsystems NaN FN have dielectric properties of considerable\ninterest. A study of this can illuminate such issues as how\nferroelectric dipolar order of the bulk evolves up from\nnanocrystals. Our main focus is the quantity \u03b1N , defined\nas the polarizability per molecular unit of a cluster of N\nmolecular units,\n\u03b1N,\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261\n\n1\n\u2202\u03bc\u03b1 /\u2202F\u03b2\nN\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ~\u03bc is the total dipole moment of a cluster or crystal\nand F~ is the external electric field.\nThe Clausius-Mossotti relation\n\u03b11\n\u03b1\u221e = lim \u03b1N =\n(2)\nN \u2192\u221e\n1 \u2212 (4\u03c0n/3)\u03b11\nis often used to relate the crystal polarizability per\nmolecule \u03b1\u221e = (\u01eb \u2212 1)/4\u03c0n to the molecular polarizability \u03b11 and the molecular density n. This equation is exact for a bulk crystalline solid where point-polarizable\nand isotropic molecules sit at sites of cubic symmetry.\nIt takes into account the local electric fields of all other\ninduced dipoles which enhance the applied field at the\ncubic sites. This provides the simplest model for a ferroelectric instability when \u03b11 is large enough. Numerical linear algebra allows the formula to be extended to\nless symmetric systems of point-polarizable molecules2 .\nHowever, no solid sequesters all polarizable entities accurately into point objects, or has only dipolar interactions,\nso the applicability of the formula to real ionic crystals,\nwhile traditional, can be regarded as largely wrong3 , or\nalternately as basically right but only after the ions are\naltered by crystal field and confinement effects4 . Here\nwe use electronic structure theory (density functional\n\ntheory, or DFT) to provide \"data\" on the evolution of\npolarizability5 .\nSemiconductors like Si6 and CdSe7 have received a\nlarge amount of attention. The alkali halides, however,\nprovide simpler model systems. Hudgins et al.8 have documented experimentally the stability of simple cuboidal\nfragment structures in NaCl. Much modeling has been\ndone, mostly using classical models such as the shell\nmodel9\u201314 . Electronic structure methods have been applied to diatomic alkali halide molecules15\u201317 and various\nalkali halide clusters18\u201320 .\nWe choose NaF as a model system for studying the evolution toward bulk properties as well as the idiosyncrasies\nof individual nanoparticles. The bulk21 and surface22 vibrational properties are both known. Foremost among\nidiosyncrasies of nanophases is the fact that non-zero\nequilibrium electrical dipoles ~\u03bc are necessary, just for\nreasons of cluster geometry and symmetry. This is well\nknown23,24 in materials like CdSe whose bulk phase lacks\ninversion symmetry. It is less well known that dipoles\nmust occur even in rather symmetrical cuboid rocksalt\nfragments, unless they have high enough symmetry (Td\nor symmetries which include inversion) to forbid a dipole.\nConcerning electrical polarity of nanoclusters, there is\na large literature of experimental and theoretical studies for metal clusters, especially simple metals25,26 (e.g.\nNa). There are also studies of polarity in semiconducting nanoclusters27 . Microscopic dielectric screening theory has been developed and implemented for\nsemiconductors28,29 . In ionic nanophase materials no\nsystematic study of polarity using full electronic structure theory is known to us. One new feature in ionic\nmaterials, not seen in metals or homopolar semiconductors, is a large contribution to polarity coming from nuclear displacements. We call this contribution the \"vibrational\" part \u03b1vib . Heteronuclear materials with partially ionic nature, such as the rocksalt crystal GeTe,\ncan have ferroelectric instabilities driven partly by vibrational polarization30 .\nNaF is a good choice for a first study for two rea-\n\n\f2\nTABLE I: Experimental and theoretical properties of the NaF\ndiatomic molecule.\npresent calc.\nNRLMOL\nd (aB )\n3.69\n\u03bc (eaB )\n3.07\n\u03c9 (cm\u22121 )\n510\n\u03b1el,\u22a5 (\u00c53 )\n2.39\n\u03b1el,k (\u00c53 )\n3.33\n\u03b1vib,k (\u00c53 )\n0.86\n\nexpt.\nref.33\n3.64\n3.21\n536\n\nexpt.\ntheory\ntheory\nref.34 ref.17,19,20 ref.15,16\n3.64\n3.6\n3.22\n3.2\n536\n540\n1.82\n1.95\n1.04\n\nTABLE II: Experimental and theoretical polarizabilities (in\n\u00c53 ) of Na and F atoms and ions.

First, there is a lot of previous work on structural properties of this and related alkali halide clusters, for which structures are generally simple fragments\n(nanocrystals, or \"cuboids\") of the bulk rocksalt structure. Second, because of the small polarizability of the\nF\u2212 ion, and the similar sizes of Na+ and F\u2212 ions, NaF\nshould be simpler than all other alkali halides, potentially\nmore amenable to analysis using models in the spirit\nof Clausius-Mossotti. There have been surprisingly few\ncalculations using full electronic structure theory; nonstoichiometric varieties (which we largely ignore) have\nreceived the most attention31 . We postpone the study\nof classical pictures for a future paper, and present here\nthe results of a quantum study using DFT. This paper\nis based largely on the results of the MA thesis of C.\nSchmidt32 .\n\nII.\n\nDIATOMIC MOLECULE\n\nThe NaF diatomic molecule or \"monomer\" allows a\ngood comparison between our calculations and both\nexperiment33\u201335 and previous theory16,19,20,36 . We use\nthe package NRLMOL37 which allows versatile and accurate DFT calculations for molecules. We choose the\nPBE38 version of generalized gradient approximation\n(GGA), and include a spin density functional for systems\nwith uncompensated spins (i.e. the Na and F atoms and\nNa14 F13 .) Results are shown in Table I. We also show\nin Fig. 1 the total energy from DFT relative to isolated\natoms. The experimental dissociation energy of 5.3 eV39\nis quite accurately reproduced, as are the bond-length,\ndipole moment, and vibrational frequency.\nCan the diatomic results be related to atomic, ionic,\n\nor bulk properties? Computed atomic and ionic polarizabilities are shown in Table II. The sum of DFT polarizabilities of the Na+ and F\u2212 ions is 1.37 \u00c53 . This is close\nto the polarizability \u03b1\u221e = 1.45 per formula unit of the\nsolid. However, Clausius-Mossotti theory gives the value\n\u03b11 =1.16 \u00c53 from the crystal data. It is difficult to know\nhow to interpret these numbers. Fowler and Madden4\nmake three relevant observations. (1) Correlation corrections greatly enhance the polarizability of the larger F\u2212\nion, doing little for the isoelectronic but smaller Na+ ion.\n(2) Putting the ion in a crystalline environment makes\nthe F\u2212 ion shrink, both because of the attractive crystal\nfield of the surrounding ions and because of the repulsion\nof the surrounding electrons. The resulting smaller ion\nhas a polarizability which is much less altered by correlation. (3) The resulting smaller polarizability estimated\nfor the \"ion-in-a-crystal\" is perhaps quite consistent with\nClausius-Mossotti. It is unfortunate that there are no direct experimental data for the polarizatility of the ions\nNa+ or F\u2212 . A long list of highly diverse values for the F\u2212\npolarizability is tabulated by Iwadate and Fukushima40 .\nNone are direct measurements.\nIt is difficult to know how to relate these ideas and\nnumbers to our calculated polarizability of the diatomic.\nIn zeroth approximation the equilibrium dipole of the\ndiatomic is ed and the electronic polarizability is the\nsum of the ionic polarizabilities, or 1.37\u00c53 . The computed dipole is smaller by 17%, but the computed polarizability is far larger than the zeroth order estimate.\nUsing the average \u1fb1 = (\u03b1xx + \u03b1yy + \u03b1zz )/3, the diatomic\nhas \u1fb11,el =2.70, larger by 2 than the sum of free ions.\nAlso the diatomic has anisotropy \u2206\u03b1/\u1fb1=34%, where\n\u2206\u03b12 = [(\u03b1xx \u2212 \u03b1yy )2 + (\u03b1yy \u2212 \u03b1zz )2 + (\u03b1zz \u2212 \u03b1xx )2 ]/2.\nIn an attempt to account for these discrepancies, three\ncorrections were tested. (1.) Each ion polarizes in the\nself-consistent field of the other, and these local field\ncorrections are accounted by solving two coupled linear\nequations for the moments \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 . Unlike Fowler and\nMadden4 , we did not correct the polarizability of the\nions for their altered environments. The corrections depend on the ratios \u03c6\u00b1 = \u03b1\u00b1 /d3 for the two ionic species,\nwhere d is the internuclear separation. For Na+ \u03c6+ =\n0.0193, and for F\u2212 \u03c6\u2212 = 0.1652. The reduced ratio\n\u03c6red = \u03c6+ \u03c6\u2212 /(\u03c6+ + \u03c6\u2212 ) is 0.0173.

Thus the vibrational contribution is 5 times the\nelectronic contribution to the bulk polarizability, whereas\nin the diatomic molecule according to Table I the ratio\nis 0.29/2.70, 50 times smaller (this uses the average of\nthe diagonal elements of the \u03b1 tensor.) An alternate\nanalysis of the bulk is to extract \"molecular\" polarizabilities from the Clausius-Mossotti formula. These are\n1.16 \u00c53 (electronic) and 2.29 \u00c53 (vibrational). The ratio is reduced from 5 to 2 but is still 20 times larger\nthan in the diatomic molecule. This remarkable difference comes partly because the electronic polarizability is\nreduced (per molecule) in the bulk, but mostly because\nthe vibrational part is increased.\n\nseparation (Angstroms)\nFIG. 1: Density functional total energy of NaF diatomic\nmolecule relative to free atoms.\n\nparallel to the molecular axis, and smaller enhancement\nperpendicular, while in the right direction, are much too\nsmall. It appears that when higher-order multipoles are\nincluded, they make corrections comparable to the dipolar ones42 so the agreement with the total dipole moment is partly accidental. (2.) Nonlinear corrections\nare not negligible since the local fields are large. Since\nthe ions are inversion-symmetric, the leading correction\nis \u03bc = (\u03b1 + \u03b2F 2 /2)F . Using NRLMOL we computed\n\u03b2=7.9 and 0.06 for F\u2212 and Na+ , in atomic units (a7B /e2 .)\nThe ions sit in fields F = e/r2 which are large, and the\nnon-linear correction is estimated to be +12% for the\npolarizability of the F part of NaF, and +1% for the Na\npart; again the direction is right but the effect is much\ntoo small. (3.) There is incomplete charge transfer between Na and F in the diatomic. Using the computed\nzero-field dipole as a measure, the static charge \u03bc/d is\n\u00b10.83e, which suggests that the Na could be treated as\n83% Na+ and 17% Na. Because of the giant polarizability of neutral Na (see Table II), it is easy to rationalize\na large correction, but less easy to make a simple classical model for both tensor components of the electronic\npolarizability.\nThe vibrational part of the polarizability is a new effect\nthat occurs in the diatomic and has no counterpart in\natoms or ions. We compute it from the formula43,44\nX\nT\nZ\u03b1,i\u03bc (K \u22121 )i\u03bc,j\u03bd Zi\u03bd,\u03b2\n(4)\n\u03b1vib,\u03b1\u03b2 =\ni\u03bc,j\u03bd\n\nwhere Z\u03b1,i\u03bc is the dynamic effective charge tensor\n\u2202\u03bc\u03b1 /\u2202ui\u03bc , ui\u03bc is the \u03bc-th Cartesian component of the\ndisplacement of the i-th atom, and K is the force constant tensor.\nSince atoms and ions have no vibrational polarizabil-\n\nIII.\n\nCLUSTERS\n\nWe have studied NaN FN for N =2, 4, 6, 9, 18, and 32.\nFor contrast, we also studied the system Na14 F13 which\nis a symmetric 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 cuboid of Oh symmetry. Except\nfor N =2, and the ring structure of N =4, these are all\ncuboids, shown in Fig. 2. Vibrational frequencies and\ninfrared activities used to compute \u03b1vib are summarized\nin Fig. 3. Polarizabilities are summarized in Figs. 4 and\n5, and polarizabilities, formation energies, and permanent dipole moments are summarized in Table III.\n\nA.\n\nNa2 F2\n\nThis cluster is not a cuboid, but is included because\nit has previously been studied experimentally46\u201349 and\ntheoretically9,19,20 . Our DFT gives a binding energy relative to two separated diatomics of 2.4eV. Previous calculations by Dickey et al.19 gave 2.6eV, which agrees well\nwith the experiment of Eisenstadt46 . The geometry is a\nrhombus with Na-F-Na angle 94.7\u25e6 and Na-F bond length\n3.96 aB , agreeing with Dickey et al. and with experiments by Hartley and Fink47 and Lapshina et al.48 .\nThe DFT prediction of polarizabilities is given in Table\nIII. The electronic contribution is surprisingly isotropic.\nPer ion pair, the polarizability \u03b1el,2 , plotted on Fig.\n4 is significantly reduced compared with the diatomic\nmolecule, and closer to the bulk limit. The vibrational\npolarizability has a large anisotropy dominated by out\nof plane motions, and per ion pair, \u1fb1vib,2 is much larger\nthan the diatomic and out-of-line with the results for\nlarger clusters, already close to the bulk value. The 6\nvibrational normal modes consist of three even, Raman\nactive modes (Ag at 205 cm\u22121 , B1g at 326, and another\nAg at 377) and three odd, infrared active modes, roughly\nequally intense (B1u at 149 cm\u22121 , B3u at 362, and B2u\nat 373). In assigning these symmetries, we used a co-\n\n\f4\nation and if harmonic approximation is sufficient, and if\nwe ignore rotations, then statistical mechanics says that\nthe fraction of rings fR should be given by\n(2,2)\n\n(4,4)\n\n(9,9)\n\n(6,6)\n\n(14,13)\n\n1/fR = 1 + e\u03b2\u2206\n\nY sinh(\u03b2h\u0304\u03c9 R /2)\ni\nC\nsinh(\u03b2h\u0304\u03c9\ni /2)\ni\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c9iR is the i-th vibrational mode of the ring and\n\u03c9iC is the i-th vibrational mode of the cuboid.

The Na4 F4 ring structure\nand Oh 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 cuboid Na32 F32 are not shown. The\nNa9 F9 and Na18 F18 C4v structures have even numbers of 3\u00d73\nplanes; planes are charged alternately + or -, so the fragments\nare polar. The Na14 F13 Oh cuboid has an odd number of\n3 \u00d7 3 planes and is non-polar. It consists of a closed shell\npositively charged cluster plus a compensating electron distributed mainly on corner Na+ ions.\n\nordinate system where the x-axis passes through the Na\natoms and the y axis through the F atoms. These numbers can be read from Fig. 3, which also shows the relative infrared intensities of the active modes. Our frequencies agree to better than 10% with unrestricted HartreeFock calculations19 and somewhat less well with shell\nmodel calculations9 . A matrix-isolation experiment49\nhas reported two Na2 F2 infrared active vibrations above\na spectrometer cutoff at 190 cm\u22121 . The experimental\nnumbers 360 and 363 cm\u22121 are close to our values. It\nis the low frequency B1u mode, polarized out of plane,\nwhich is responsible, because of its low frequency, for the\nlarge zz-component of vibrational polarizability in our\ncalculation.\n\nOur computed vibrational spectra, shown in Fig. 3, give\nthe logarithmic denominator to be 8.5, greatly reducing\nthe temperature of isomerization. This reduction factor should be slightly increased to take into account the\nhigher rotational moments of inertia, and thus higher rotational entropy, of the rings.\nThe polarizabilities, shown in Table III, are surprisingly isotropic for the ring. Electronic parts are surprisingly similar for the ring and cube geometries, while the\nvibrational polarizability is bigger by a factor 4 in the\nring because of the low frequency infrared activity shown\nin Fig. 3.\nAn interesting property of the Na4 F4 Td structure is\nthat the ground state has an octupole (xyz) moment, but\nno quadrupole moment. In the point group Td , a vector\n(x, y, z) and an off-diagonal second-rank symmetric tensor (yz, zx, xy) have the same symmetry. This means\nthat an applied electric field Fz \u1e91 induces both a dipole\nmoment \u03bcz and a quadrupole moment \u0398xy 50 . We calculated the octupole moment, which is equivalent to static\npoint charges of \u00b10.866e on the ions. This can be compared with the static charge \u00b10.83e deduced from the\ndipole of the monomer NaF. The induced quadrupole was\ncomputed to be\nZ\n3\n\u0398xy =\nd3 rxy\u03c1(~r) = (\u22128.2a4B )Fz .\n(7)\n2\nC.\n\nB.\n\nLarger Stoichiometric Cuboids\n\nNa4 F4\n\nThis cluster has a relatively low-lying structural isomer with a D4h ring geometry which has been studied\ntheoretically14 . We find the Td cuboid geometry to be\nlower in energy than the ring by \u2206=0.75 eV, twice as\nmuch as the figure 0.37 eV mentioned by Calvo14 . The\nvibrations of the ring have a wider range of frequencies\nthan any of the cuboids, with many low-frequency modes.\nWe estimate the temperature of isomerization to be 1000\nK in the following way. If only two isomers need consider-\n\nThe vibrational eigenfrequencies are shown in Fig. 3.\nThe polarizabilities are shown in Fig. 4, and contrasted\nwith crystalline compounds in Fig. 5.

The electronic polarizability does approach the bulk limit rapidly, but the vibrational part\ndoes not. There is a subtlety in the vibrational polarizability of the bulk. The Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation\nshows that the splitting of TO and LO optical phonon frequencies is tied to the splitting \u01ebdc \u2212 \u01ebopt . In point group\nTd or Oh , the infrared optic modes belong to triply degenerate representations \u2013 there is no distinction between\nLO and TO. The bulk crystal violates this symmetry only\nbecause the distance of spatial variation of the probing\nelectric field is smaller than the sample size. Therefore\nthe bulk limit for \u03b1vib may not be reached until the sample size exceeds the wavelength of the radiation used to\nmeasure \u01ebdc .\nWe have done three clusters with uniaxial anisotropy.\nNa6 F6 is first in a sequence of long skinny cuboids of\n2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 (2n + 1) structures with D2h symmetry or of\n2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 (2n + 2) structures with D2d symmetry. Actually\nthe former group is not strictly uniaxial, but has weak\nsplitting of the equatorial two-fold axes, which accounts\nfor a very weak splitting of the xx and yy parts of the \u03b1\ntensors. Na9 F9 and Na18 F18 are the first two of the C4v\nsequence of 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2n structures. The polarizability is\nrelatively isotropic, except that the vibrational polarizability of Na18 F18 is 20% enhanced along its long axis.\nThe clusters with dimensions 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (2n + 1) have an\nodd atom count and are thus non-stoichiometric. The Oh\n3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 cluster Na14 F13 is discussed below; the higher\nclusters have D4h symmetry.\n\nD.\n\nPermanent Dipole Moments\n\nThe two cuboids of C4v symmetry, Na9 F9 and\nNa18 F18 , have permanent dipole moments just of structural necessity. Naively, if the cuboid were an exact\nsodium chloride structure fragment, with the NaF bulk\nlattice constant of 4.62 \u00c5, and the charge of \u00b1e were assigned to the ions, then the dipole moments would be 2.31\ne\u00c5 and 4.62 e\u00c5 for the smaller and larger cuboids. How-\n\never, the ions have somewhat distorted positions, and the\nstructural dipoles are reduced to 1.34 e\u00c5 and 3.16 e\u00c5 respectively, assuming unit quantized charges. The actual\nDFT values, shown in Table III are 1.06 e\u00c5 and 2.71 e\u00c5,\nrespectively. These numbers show that the total dipole is\nreduced by screening, both \"vibrational\" and electronic.\nVibrational screening is larger than electronic, in line\nwith the fact that vibrational polarizabilities are roughly\ntwice electronic polarizabilities. The slab-shaped Na9 F9\nis more affected by screening than the needle-shaped\nNa18 F18 , as one expects from the well-known depolarization effects in slab vs. needle shaped samples. The\ndipole of Na18 F18 was previously calculated by Rayane\net al.1 to be 7.5 D = 1.84 e\u00c5, significantly smaller than\nour value. Their calculation was part of an investigation\nof non-stoichiometric NaN FN \u22121 species such as Na18 F17 .\nOnly the outer electron was treated by quantum mechanics. The stoichiometric species has no outer electron, so\napparently their number is based on a classical polarizable ion model, which apparently overscreens.\n\nE.\n\nNon-stoichiometric Oh Na14 F13\n\nThis is such an interesting cuboid that we could not\nresist departing from our main theme of polarizability\nevolution in stoichiometric cuboids. The last electron re\u2212\nsides outside the closed shell of Na+\n14 F13 . Alkali halides\nwith one electron outside a closed shell have attracted\nattention1,51 since the prediction by Landman et al. that\nsuch clusters might have a second-order Jahn-Teller instability. This, and the subsequent studies by Durand et\nal.53,54 kept only a single electron in the quantum part\nof the dynamics, while Ochsenfeld and Ahlrichs55 have\nstudied several alkali halides using all-electron theory.\nThe single outer electron gives rise to a giant electronic\npolarizability shown in Table III. On a per molecule basis, the total polarizability of 313 \u00c53 , shared by 13.5\nmolecules, is larger by 15 than the interpolated value\n\u223c 1.5 seen in Fig. 4.

On a\nper molecule basis, the vibrational polarizability of 24.7\nis smaller by 0.6 than the interpolated value of the stoichiometric clusters. Apparently the loose last electron\nis exceedingly polarizable, and partly screens the change\nin dipole per unit displacement that causes vibrational\npolarizability according to Eq. (4).\nThe large polarizability gives one a right to expect that\nNa14 F13 might distort to a lower symmetry polar structure such as C3v , as was discovered theoretically in a\n\nrestricted model by Landman et al.52 in the Na14 Cl13\ncuboid. In a naive view, point-polarizable ions have a\ndensity-dependent critical \u03b1el,c beyond which ions polarize spontaneously. In cubic crystals it is 3/4\u03c0n which\nequals 5.88 \u00c53 for the density n in bulk NaF. In fragments\n\u03b1c approaches the bulk limit rapidly2 . The per molecule\nelectronic polarizability of Na14 F13 is way beyond that\nlimit, and thus unstable in this model. However, the giant polarizability is almost all associated with the delocalized last electron, making the Clausius-Mossotti analysis inappropriate.\nThe highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is\nnon-degenerate but lies not far below other levels with\nwhich it is forbidden by symmetry to mix. The secondorder Jahn-Teller effect is a distortion motivated by\nthe \"desire\" for such a mixture in order to lower\n(quadratically in distortion amplitude) the HOMO energy. Kristoffel and Konsin56 argue that such a mechanism is at work in the ferroelectric distortion of GeTe\ncrystals, involving the mixing between states just below\nand just above the narrow gap of this IV-VI semiconductor with two more electrons than are needed to fill the\nusual s \u2212 p shell. The instability of Landman et al.52 is\na nanocrystalline analog.\nWe find that this instability does not happen in\nNa14 F13 . This contradicts other theories and the interpretation by Rayane et al.1 of their experiment. Theories\nwhich keep only the extra outer electron are not reliable\nenough if the energy balance is delicate.

There was a moderate\nT -dependence, but not the full 1/T of the usual DebyeLangevin polarizability \u03bc2 /3kB T of a molecule with a\npermanent dipole \u03bc. Nevertheless, the authors believe\ntheir data to be consistent with a permanent dipole, although they do not claim that their analysis is firm. Our\nfinding is that the electronic polarizability is indeed extremely large and will give large deflections, but there\nis no symmetry-breaking or permanent dipole moment.\nWe believe the data may be consistent with this alternate\ninterpretation.\nIV.\nA.\n\nDISCUSSION\nFormation energy\n\nWe define the formation energy Ef as the energy per\nion pair relative to the energy of separated neutral atoms.\nValues of Ef are given in Table III. The increasing formation energy with cluster size can be organized phenomenologically according to the numbers of ions with\nvarious geometric sites. We distinguish corner, edge,\nface, and interior ions. In the NaN FN cuboids these sites\noccur as pairs of oppositely charged ions. For example,\nNa4 F4 has 4 corner pairs, Na6 F6 has 4 corners and 2\nedges, Na9 F9 has 4 corners, 4 edges, and one face, and\nNa18 F18 has 4 corners, 8 edges, 5 faces, and 1 interior ion\npair. The values of Ef then correspond to the assignment\n7.01 eV for corner pairs, 7.53 eV for edge pairs, 7.63 eV\nfor face pairs, and 9.11 eV for interior pairs. This last\nis close to the experimental bulk value of 9.30 eV. These\n\nTrends of Polarizability\n\nThe trend to smaller electronic polarizability as size\nincreases should certainly be attributed to enhanced stabilization of the filled p shell as the ion acquires larger\nnumbers of neighboring counterions. The HOMO and\nLUMO states of a finite cluster are located mostly at the\nsurface. The HOMO-LUMO gap is reduced in clusters\nrelative to bulk, corresponding to a cluster analog of surface localized states on a bulk surface. As the cluster\nsize increases, electronic spectral weight gets pushed upward toward the bulk band gap of 11eV58 . In bulk alkali\nhalides, an excess electron is a delocalized carrier, but an\nexcess hole self-traps on a dimerized anion pair (VK center). On clusters, one would expect the trapped hole to\nlie on surface anions. The excess electron, after migrating to the surface, might also self-trap. This would be a\n\"pseudo-Jahn-Teller polaron\". The fact that the secondorder Jahn-Teller effect does not occur in Na18 F17 (according to us) suggests that the surface electron might\nnot trap but remain delocalized. We note that localization of the excess electron could be enhanced within a formalism where the electronic self-interaction (SI) is fully\ncorrected59 . Further investigation of this effect within\nan SI-free framework would be necessary to rule out the\npossibility of surface trapping.\nThe enhanced vibrational polarization of larger clusters is harder to explain. Large electronic polarizability should diminish vibrational polarizability by screeing.\nThe dynamical effective charge matrix (change of electrical dipole per unit displacement) is reduced by the polarizability of the ions which are displacing (see Eq. 3.)\nWe find little support for this idea in the trends of dielectric constants of other alkali halides, shown in Fig. 5.\nHere the value of \u03b1 per molecule is (\u01eb \u2212 1)/4\u03c0n, with the\noptical dielectric constant giving the \u03b1el as before.
