Introduction\nThe idea of using rotating black holes as energy sources has a long history. To our\nknowledge, Salpeter [1] and Zel'dovich [1] were the first to point out that gigantic black holes\nmight serve as power engines for quasars or radio galaxies. Realistic theoretical models to\nrealize this type of energy extraction from rotating black holes also appeared afterwards and\nthey are due to Penrose [2], Press and Teukolsky [2], Ruffini and Wilson [3], Damour [3], and\nBlandford and Znajek [4]. Among these models, that of Blandford and Znajek is particularly\ninteresting in its formulation and looks quite plausible in its operational mechanism. At\nfirst, puzzling over the possible explanation for the observed twin jets pointing oppositely\nout of a black hole-accretion disk system, Blandford and Znajek conceived of a particular\nprocess in which the power going into the jets comes from the hole's enormous rotational\nenergy. Schematically, their mechanism works as follows ; suppose that the rotating hole is\nthreaded by magnetic field lines. As the hole spins, it drags the field lines around, causing\nthem to fling surrounding plasma upward and downward to form two jets. Then the jets\nshoot out along the hole's spin axis and their direction is firmely fixed to the hole's axis\nof rotation. The magnetic field lines, of course, come from the accretion disk around the\nhole. Namely, it is the magnetic fields that extract the rotational energy of a black hole\nand then act to power the jets. According to their careful analysis, on the other hand, as\nthe energy is extracted, electric currents flow into the horizon near the hole's poles (in the\nform of positively-charged particles falling inward), and currents flow out of the horizon\nnear the equator (in the form of negatively-charged particles falling inward). It was as\nthough the hole were a voltage generator of an electric circuit driving current out of the\nhorizon's equator, then up magnetic field lines to a large distance, then through \"plasma\nload\" to other field lines near the hole's spin axis, then down those field lines and into\nthe horizon. Namely, the magnetic field were the wires of the electric circuits, the plasma\nwas the load that exerts power from the circuit. And the two pictures, one schematic and\nthe other analytic, are just two different ways of describing the same phenomenon. This\n3\n\n\felectric circuit description was totally unexpected and thus curious enough although it was\nresulted from a careful general relativistic treatment of the problem. Right after the post\nof this new mechanism, Znajek [5] and, independently, Damour [6] succeeded in translating\nthe careful general relativistic formulation into a surprisingly simple non-relativistic, flat\nspacetime electrodynamics language, the celebrated four horizon boundary conditions. And\nthe assumption of central importance in this new picture is to endow the horizon with some\nfictitious surface charge and current as those previously imagined by Hanni and Ruffini\n[7]. It is really amusing that one now has an option to view the situation in terms of flat\nspacetime electrodynamics alone at least for rough understanding.\nSpeaking of the theory that governs the electromagnetism, however, it is interesting to note\nthat historically, there has been another classical theory that can be thought of as a larger\nclass of theory involving the standard Maxwell theory just as its limiting case. It is the theory\nproposed in the 1930's by Born and Infeld [9]. In spite of its long history, the Born-Infeld\n(BI) theory of electrodynamics has remained almost unnoticed and hence nearly uncovered\nin full detail. This theory may be thought of as a highly nonlinear generalization of or a\nnon-trivial alternative to the standard Maxwell theory of electromagnetism. It is known that\nBorn and Infeld had been led, when they first constructed this theory, by the considerations\nsuch as finiteness of the energy in electrodynamics, natural recovery of the usual Maxwell\ntheory as a linear approximation and the hope to find soliton-like solutions representing\npoint-like charged particles. In the present work we would like to explore the interaction\nof electromagnetic fields with a rotating (Kerr) black hole but in the context of BI theory\nof electromagnetism instead of Maxwell theory. And our particular concern is to derive BI\ntheory versions of the four horizon boundary conditions to see how they would change from\nthe ones derived originally by Znajek and by Damour in the context of Maxwell theory. Now\nthe motivation for shifting the theory of electromagnetism from that of standard Maxwell\nto that of BI to study the physics of interaction between \"test\" electromagnetic field and\n\"background\" rotating black hole geometry can be stated as follows. The BI theory, although\nappeared as a \"classical\" theory long before the advent of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)\n4\n\n\ftheory, may be viewed as some kind of an effective low-energy theory of QED in that\nits highly non-linear structure plays the role of eliminating the short-distance divergences.\nNormally, the strong magnetic field, believed to be anchored in the central black holes of\ntypical gamma-ray bursters, is regarded as being originated, say, from that of neutron stars\nthat has collapsed to form the black hole. A number of various observations indicate that\nin young neutron stars, the surface magnetic field strengths are of order 1011 \u223c 1013 (Gauss)\nand in some extreme cases such as magnetars, magnetic field strengths are estimated to be\nas large as \u2265 5 \u00d7 1014 (Gauss) [8]. Then the magnetic field of this ultra strength, in turn,\nstimulates our curiosity and leads us to ask questions such as ; what would happen if we\nchoose to employ the BI theory that, as stated, can be thought of as an effective theory of\nQED, instead of linear Maxwell theory, to stdudy the physics in the vicinity of rotating hole's\nhorizon ? And in doing so, we anticipate that perhaps the highly non-linear nature of the BI\ntheory may serve to uncover some hidden interplay between the strong electromagnetic field\nand ultra strong gravity near the hole's horizon. Since our main concern is the derivation\nof the four horizon boundary conditions in BI theory, we now recall some of the basic\ningredients of these boundary conditions obtained in the conventional Maxwell theory.\nThe four \"horizon boundary conditions\" first derived in the works of Znajek [5] and of\nDamour [6] and reformulated later in the literature can be briefly described as follows. They\nmay be called radiative ingoing boundary condition, Ohm's law, Gauss' law and Ampere's\nlaw, respectively. And in order to represent each boundary condition properly, we need to\nintroduce in advance some quantities that will be derived carefully in the text shortly. They\n~H, B\n~ H ) as seen by a local observer in a\nare electric and magnetic fields at the horizon (E\nnull tetrad frame which has been made to be well-behaved at the horizon by the amount\nof boost that becomes suitably infinite at the horizon and the fictitious charge and current\ndensities (\u03c3, ~\u03ba) that have been assigned at the horizon in such a way that the sum of\nreal current 4-vector outside the horizon and this fictitious current 4-vector on the horizon\ntogether is conserved. Firstly, then, the radiative ingoing boundary condition first derived\n~H = E\n~ H \u00d7 n\u0302 with n\u0302 being the outer unit normal to the horizon.\nby Znajek [5] takes the form B\n5\n\n\fEvidently, it states that the electric and magnetic fields tangential to the horizon are equal\nin magnitude and perpendicular in direction and hence their Poynting energy flux is into the\n~ H = 4\u03c0~\u03ba. It has been derived rigorously in the work\nhole. Secondly, the Ohm's law reads E\nby Damour [6] and pointed out in the work by Znajek [5]. Clearly, this relation takes on\nthe form of a non-relativistic Ohm's law for a conductor and hence implies that if we endow\nthe horizon with some charge and current densities (which are to be determined by the\nsurrounding external electromagnetic field F\u03bc\u03bd as we shall see in the text), then the horizon\nbehaves as if it is a conductor with finite surface resistivity of \u03c1 = 4\u03c0 \u2243 377(ohms). Actually\nthese two relations are the ones that have been explicitly derived in the works by Znajek and\nby Damour and play the central role in justifying that the introduction of fictitious charge\nand current densities on the horizon indeed provides a self-consistent picture. That is, one\nmight wonder what would happen to the Joule heat generated when those surface currents\nwork against the surface resistance and how it would be related to the electromagnetic energy\ngoing down the hole through the horizon. In their works, Znajek and Damour provided a\nsimple and natural answer to this question. Namely, they showed in an elegant manner\nthat the total electromagnetic energy flux (i.e., the Poynting flux) into the rotating Kerr\nhole through the horizon is indeed precisely the same as the amount of Joule heat (Ohmic\ndissipation) produced by the surface currents when they work against the surface resistivity\nof 4\u03c0. As a result, one may think of the rotating hole as a conducting sphere that absorbs the\nincident electromagnetic energy flux as a form of Joule heat that the surface current (driven\nby the electromagnetic fields) generates when it interferes with the surface resistivity. This\nis indeed an interesting and quite convincing alternative picture of viewing the interaction\nof external electromagnetic fields with a rotating black hole. Damour [6] also remarked\nthat this result provides a clear confirmation of Carter's assertion [10] that a black hole is\nanalogous to an ordinary object having finite viscosity and electrical conductivity. Thirdly,\nif one follows the formulation of Damour but in a slightly different way in taking the local\ntetrad frame and projecting the Maxwell field tensor and the surface current 4-vector onto\nthat chosen tetrad frame, one also gets the relation Er\u0302 = 4\u03c0\u03c3 which may be identified\n6\n\n\fwith the surface version of Gauss' law. It says that the fictitious surface charge density we\nassumed on the horizon plays the role of terminating the normal components of all electric\nfields that pierce the horizon. Lastly, if we combine the radiative ingoing boundary condition\n~H = E\n~ H \u00d7 n\u0302 with the Ohm's law E\n~ H = 4\u03c0~\u03ba, we\nat the horizon that we obtained earlier, B\n~ H = 4\u03c0(~\u03ba \u00d7 n\u0302) which can be viewed as the surface version\nend up with the fourth relation B\nof Ampere's law. Again, consistently with our motivation for introducing fictitious current\ndensity on the horizon, this relation indicates that the current density we assumed plays the\nrole of terminating any tangential components of all magnetic fields penetrating the horizon.\nAnd actually these four horizon boundary conditions later on provided a strong motivation\nfor the proposal of so-called \"membrane paradigm [11]\" of black holes by Thorne and his\ncollaborators. As we already mentioned, in the present work we would like to particularly\nderive BI theory versions of these four horizon boundary conditions to see if they would\nchange from the ones given above and if they would, how. Interestingly enough, as far as we\nemploy the same local null tetrad frame as the one adopted in the works by Damour and by\nZnajek, it turns out that we end up with exactly the same four horizon boundary conditions\ndespite the shift of the electrodynamics theory from a linear Maxwell one to a highly nonlinear BI one. As we shall see shortly in the text, this curious and unexpected result can\nbe attributed to the fact that the nature of the BI theory or more precisely, the concrete\nstructure of BI equations happens to be such that it is indistinguishable at the horizon to\na local observer, say, in Damour's local tetrad frame from that of standard Maxwell theory.\nWe find this point indeed quite amusing on theoretical side.\nII. Choice of coordinate system and tetrad frame\nThe relevant choice of coordinate system and the proper choice and treatment of the\nassociated tetrad frame for the background Kerr black hole spacetime is of primary importance to discuss electrodynamics on this geometry in terms of physical field values (here, the\nmeaning of \"physical\" values will be unambiguously defined shortly). Thus in this section,\nwe shall carefully choose the coordinate system and perform a proper treatment of the as7\n\n\fsociated tetrad frame to derive the four horizon boundary conditions based on these choices\nlater on. Generally speaking, in order to represent the background Kerr geometry, we need\nto choose a coordinate system in which the metric is to be given and in order to obtain\nphysical components of a tensor (such as the electric and magnetic field values), we need to\nselect a tetrad frame (in a given coordinate system) to which the tensor components are to\nbe projected. It has been known for some time that there are three important coordinate\nsystems for Kerr spacetime ; ingoing/outgoing Kerr coordinates, Kerr-Schild coordinates,\nand Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. First, the Kerr-Schild coordinates are quasi-Cartesian coordinates and the well-known ring structure of curvature singularity can only be uncovered\nin this coordinate system. Next, the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates can be viewed as the generalization of Schwarzschild coordinates to the stationary, axisymmetric case. Lastly, the Kerr\ncoordinates can be thought of as the axisymmetric generalization of Eddington-Finkelstein\nnull coordinates and hence are free of coordinate singularities. In particular, the ingoing\n(advanced) null coordinates represent a reference frame of \"freely-falling\" photons. As such,\nthese ingoing Kerr coordinates are well-behaved on the event horizon and thus meet our\npurpose to explore the electrodynamics near the horizon. Turning to the choice of tetrad\nframe, there are largely two types of tetrad frames ; orthonormal tetrad and null tetrad.\nAs is well-known, the orthonormal tetrad is a set of four mutually orthogonal unit vectors\nat each point in a given spacetime which give the directions of the four axes of locallyMinkowskian coordinate system\nds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = \u03b7AB eA eB\n= \u2212(e0 )2 + (e1 )2 + (e2 )2 + (e3 )2\n\n(1)\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nwhere eA = eA\n\u03bc dx . Namely, every physical observer with 4-velocity u has associated\n\nwith him an orthonormal frame in which the basis vectors are the (reciprocal of) orthonormal tetrad eA = {e0 = u, e1 , e2 , e3 }. And corresponding to this is a null tetrad\nZA = {l, n, m, m\u0304} defined by\n\n8\n\n\f1\n1\ne0 = \u221a (l + n), e1 = \u221a (l \u2212 n),\n2\n2\n1\n1\ne2 = \u221a (m + m\u0304), e3 = \u221a (m \u2212 m\u0304)\n2\n2i\n\n(2)\n\nsatisfying the orthogonality relation\n\u2212 l\u03bc n\u03bc = 1 = m\u03bc m\u0304\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nwith all other contractions being zero and\ng \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212l\u03bc n\u03bd \u2212 n\u03bc l\u03bd + m\u03bc m\u0304\u03bd + m\u0304\u03bc m\u03bd .\n\n(4)\n\nConversely, given a non-singular null tetrad, there is a corresponding physical observer. The\ntetrad vectors then can be used to obtain, from tensors in arbitrary coordinate system, their\nphysical (i.e., finite and non-zero) components measured by an observer in this locally-flat\ntetrad frame. And the rules for calculating the physical components of a tensor, say, T\u03bc\u03bd in\nthe orthonormal frame and in the null frame are given respectively by\nTAB = T\u03bc\u03bd (e\u03bcA e\u03bdB ),\n\nTlm = T\u03bc\u03bd (l\u03bc m\u03bd ),\n\netc.\n\n(5)\n\n\u03bc B\n\u03bc A\nB\n\u03bc\nwhere e\u03bcA is the inverse of the tetrad vectors eA\n\u03bc in that eA e\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bd and eA e\u03bc = \u03b4A .\n\n1. Hawking-Hartle (or Teukolsky) tetrad\nAs we stated earlier in the introduction, we would like to derive Znajek-Damour-type\nboundary conditions at the horizon of Kerr black hole in the context of BI theory of electromagnetism. Generally speaking, all that is required of the \"correct\" boundary conditions\nfor electric and magnetic fields at the horizon can be stated as follows. The physical field's\ncomponents in the neighborhood of an event horizon should have \"nonspecial\" values. Or\nput another way, a physically well-behaved observer at the horizon should see the fields as\nhaving finite and non-zero values. And this can be achieved only when one works in the coordinates having non-singular behavior at the horizon with the choice of a null tetrad frame.\nSuch a choice of well-behaved null tetrad frame has been provided long ago by Hawking\nand Hartle [12] and also by Teukolsky [13]. Thus in order to briefly review the derivation of\n9\n\n\ftheir tetrad, we start with Kinnersley's null tetrad [14] given originally in Boyer-Lindquist\ncoordinates x\u03bc = (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6\u0303)\n(r 2 + a2 )\na\nl =\n,\n, 1, 0,\n\u2206\n\u2206\n!\n(r 2 + a2 ) \u2212\u2206\na\n\u03bc\nn =\n,\n,\n, 0,\n2\u03a3\n2\u03a3\n2\u03a3\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\n1\n\u03bc\nia sin \u03b8, 0, 1,\n.\nm =\u221a\nsin \u03b8\n2(r + ia cos \u03b8)\n!\n\n\u03bc\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03a3 = r 2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8 and \u2206 = r 2 + a2 \u2212 2Mr with M and a being the ADM mass and the\nangular momentum per unit mass of the hole respectively. As is well-known, this tetrad is\nnot well-behaved on the horizon where \u2206 = 0 since it is given in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates\n(which themselves are singular on the horizon) and hence cannot be of any practical use.\n\u2032\n\nThus we transform them to the ingoing Kerr coordinates x \u03bc = (v, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) via the coordinate\ntransformation law\ndv = dt +\n\n(r 2 + a2 )\ndr,\n\u2206\n\nd\u03c6 = d\u03c6\u0303 +\n\na\ndr\n\u2206\n\n(7)\n\nto obtain, after the standard procedure,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u03bc\n\nZA =\n\n\u2202x \u03bc\nZA\u03bd\n\u2202x\u03bd\n!\n\nwhere ZA\u03bc = (l\u03bc , n\u03bc , m\u03bc , m\u0304\u03bc ),\n\n2(r 2 + a2 )\n2a\nl =\n,\n, 1, 0,\n\u2206\n\u2206\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2212\u2206\n\u03bc\n, 0, 0 ,\nn = 0,\n2\u03a3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\ni\n\u03bc\n.\nm =\u221a\nia sin \u03b8, 0, 1,\nsin \u03b8\n2(r + ia cos \u03b8)\n!\n\n\u03bc\n\n(8)\n\nAlthough it is expressed in these well-behaved ingoing Kerr coordinates, this null tetrad is\nstill singular at the horizon where \u2206 = 0. At this point, notice that we can get around this\ndifficulty using the tetrad transformations. Namely, recall that the orthogonality relations\nfor null tetrad given in eq.(3) remain invariant under the 6-parameter group of homogeneous Lorentz transformations at each point of spacetime. And this Lorentz group can be\ndecomposed into 3-Abelian subgroups ;\n10\n\n\f(I) l \u2192 l,\n\nm \u2192 m + al,\n\nn \u2192 n + am\u0304 + \u0101m + a\u0101l,\n\n(II) n \u2192 n,\n\nm \u2192 m + bn,\n\n(III) l \u2192 \u039bl,\n\nn \u2192 \u039b\u22121 n,\n\nl \u2192 l + bm\u0304 + b\u0304m + bb\u0304n,\n\n(9)\n\nm \u2192 ei\u03b8 m\n\nwhere a and b are complex numbers and \u039b and \u03b8 are real. Each of these group transformations are called a \"null rotation\" and here we particularly consider the null rotation\n(III). Under this null rotation (III), the corresponding orthonormal tetrad eA is boosted in\nthe e1 = er\u0302 direction with 3-velocity (\u039b2 \u2212 1)/(\u039b2 + 1) and spatially rotated about e1 = er\u0302\nthrough the angle \u03b8. Indeed this action is precisely what we need. Namely, in order to\nget a null tetrad well-behaved at the horizon, we need to boost it by an amount that becomes suitably infinite on the horizon. Thus we perform the null rotation (III) on the\nKinnersley's null tetrad given in ingoing null tetrad given above with \u039b = \u2206/2(r 2 + a2 ) and\nei\u03b8 = \u03a31/2 /(r \u2212 ia cos \u03b8) to obtain the following non-singular null tetrad on the horizon ;\n!\n\n\u2206\na\nl = 1,\n,\n, 0,\n2\n2\n2\n2(r + a )\n(r + a2 )\n!\n\u2212(r 2 + a2 )\n\u03bc\n, 0, 0 ,\nn = 0,\n\u03a3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\ni\n\u03bc\nm = \u221a 1/2 ia sin \u03b8, 0, 1,\n.\nsin \u03b8\n2\u03a3\n\u03bc\n\n(10)\n\nThis is the Hawking-Hartle (or Teukolsky) null tetrad and the associated covariant components are given by\n!\n\n\u2212\u2206\n\u03a3\n\u2206\nl\u03bc =\n,\n0,\na sin2 \u03b8 ,\n2(r 2 + a2 ) (r 2 + a2 )\n2(r 2 + a2 )\n!\n(r 2 + a2 )\n\u2212(r 2 + a2 )\n, 0, 0,\na sin2 \u03b8 ,\nn\u03bc =\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nm\u03bc = \u221a 1/2 \u2212ia sin \u03b8, 0, \u03a3, i(r 2 + a2 ) sin \u03b8 .\n2\u03a3\n\n(11)\n\n2. Damour's quasi-orthonormal tetrad\nIt is interesting to note that generally one can \"mix\" half of the null tetrad ZA =\n(l, n, m, m\u0304) and half of the orthonormal tetrad eA = (e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 ) to form a \"quasiorthonormal\" or \"mixed\" tetrad\n11\n\n\f{l\u03bc ,\n\n\u2212 n\u03bc , e\u03bc2 , e\u03bc3 } ,\n\nn\n\no\n\n\u2212n\u03bc , l\u03bc , e2\u03bc , e3\u03bc .\n\n(12)\n\nAnd if we construct this half-null, half-orthonormal, mixed tetrad from the previous\nHawking-Hartle null tetrad, it becomes Damour's quasi-orthonormal tetrad as we can see\nshortly. Before we proceed, let us elaborate on the general construction of this mixed tetrad.\nUsing the relations between the orthonormal tetrad eA and null tetrad ZA given in eq.(2),\nB\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\nds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd = \u03b7AB eA\n\u03bc e\u03bd dx dx\n\n= (\u2212l\u03bc n\u03bd \u2212 n\u03bc l\u03bd + m\u03bc m\u0304\u03bd + m\u0304\u03bc m\u03bd ) dx\u03bc dx\u03bd\n\n(13)\n\nand hence g\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212l\u03bc n\u03bd \u2212 n\u03bc l\u03bd + m\u03bc m\u0304\u03bd + m\u0304\u03bc m\u03bd . However, since the pair (e0 , e1 ) is related\nonly to (l, n) while the pair (e2 , e3 ) is related only to (m, m\u0304), one can write, using m\u03bc m\u0304\u03bd +\nm\u0304\u03bc m\u03bd = e2\u03bc e2\u03bd + e3\u03bc e3\u03bd ,\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212l\u03bc n\u03bd \u2212 n\u03bc l\u03bd + e2\u03bc e2\u03bd + e3\u03bc e3\u03bd\n\nor\n\ng \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212l\u03bc n\u03bd \u2212 n\u03bc l\u03bd + e\u03bc2 e\u03bd2 + e\u03bc3 e\u03bd3 .\n\n(14)\n\nThis obviously implies that one may mix half of null tetrad and half of orthonormal tetrad\nto form a mixed tetrad as given in eq.(12). Therefore, we now construct this mixed tetrad\nfrom the previous Hawking-Hartle tetrad as\n!\n\na\n\u2206\n,\n, 0,\n\u2261 l = 1,\n2\n2\n2\n2(r + a )\n(r + a2 )\n!\n(r 2 + a2 )\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\ne1 \u2261 \u2212n = 0,\n, 0, 0 ,\n\u03a3\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n, 0\ne2 = \u221a (m + m\u0304 ) = 0, 0,\n\u03a31/2\n2\n!\na sin \u03b8\n1\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n, 0, 0,\ne3 = \u221a (m \u2212 m\u0304 ) =\n\u03a31/2\n\u03a31/2 sin \u03b8\n2i\n\ne\u03bc0\n\n\u03bc\n\n(15)\n\nand its dual is\n\u2212(r 2 + a2 )\n(r 2 + a2 )\n\u2261 \u2212n\u03bc =\n, 0, 0,\na sin \u03b8 ,\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\n!\n\u2212\u2206\n\u03a3\n\u2206\n1\n2\ne\u03bc \u2261 l\u03bc =\n,\n, 0,\na sin \u03b8 ,\n2(r 2 + a2 ) (r 2 + a2 )\n2(r 2 + a2 )\n!\n\ne0\u03bc\n\n12\n\n(16)\n\n\f\u0010\n\u0011\n1\ne2\u03bc = \u221a (m\u03bc + m\u0304\u03bc ) = 0, 0, \u03a31/2 , 0\n2\n!\n\u2212a sin \u03b8\n(r 2 + a2 )\n1\n3\n, 0, 0,\nsin \u03b8\ne\u03bc = \u221a (m\u03bc \u2212 m\u0304\u03bc ) =\n\u03a31/2\n\u03a31/2\n2i\n\nwhere we renamed as\nl\u03bc \u2192 e\u03bc0 ,\n\nn\u03bc \u2192 \u2212e\u03bc1 ,\n\nl\u03bc \u2192 e1\u03bc ,\n\nn\u03bc \u2192 \u2212e0\u03bc ,\n\nto go from the null tetrad's orthogonality relations \u2212l\u03bc n\u03bc = 1 = m\u03bc m\u0304\u03bc to the usual orthonor\u03bc A\n\u03bc\nB\nmality condition e\u03bcA eB\n\u03bc = \u03b4A , eA e\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bd . Note that this mixed tetrad precisely coincides\n\nwith Damour's choice of quasi-orthonormal tetrad [6].

In this sense, our choice\n13\n\n\fof local tetrad frame is slightly different from that in the original work of Damour [6] in\nwhich he introduced, particularly on the 2-dimensional, v =const. section of the event horizon, some other orthonormal basis (slightly different from {e\u03bc2 , e\u03bc3 } given above) specially\nadapted to the \"intrinsic geometry\" of the v = const. section of the horizon and used them\nto project out physical components of tensors.\nBefore we proceed, we momentarily recall the \"Zero-Angular-Momentum-Observer\n(ZAMO)\" tetrad in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates for the sake of comparison with this quasiorthonormal tetrad in ingoing Kerr coordinates. The dual of ZAMO tetrad is given by\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u1ebdA = \u1ebd0 = \u1ebd(t) , \u1ebd1 = \u1ebd(r) , \u1ebd2 = \u1ebd(\u03b8) , \u1ebd3 = \u1ebd(\u03c6\u0303) ,\n1\n[\u2202t + \u03a9\u2202\u03c6\u0303 ],\n\u03b1\n\u0012 \u00131/2\n\u2206\n\u1ebd1 =\n\u2202r ,\n\u03a3\n1\n\u1ebd2 = 1/2 \u2202\u03b8 ,\n\u03a3\n\u0012 \u00131/2\n\u03a3\n1\n\u1ebd3 =\n\u2202\nA\nsin \u03b8 \u03c6\u0303\n\u1ebd0 =\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03b12 = (\u03a3\u2206/A), A = [(r 2 + a2 )2 \u2212 \u2206a2 sin2 \u03b8], \u03a9 = \u2212gt\u03c6\u0303 /g\u03c6\u0303\u03c6\u0303 = 2Mra/A ith \u03b1 being the\nlapse function. As is well-known, this ZAMO tetrad, particularly \u1ebd(t) exhibits pathological\nbehavior as the horizon is approached, i.e., in the limit, \u2206 \u2192 0 or \u03b1 \u2192 0 and it can be\nattributed to the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate system itself as it is ill-defined at the horizon.\nAs a matter of fact, this is precisely the reason why we (and originally Damour) choose\nto work in ingoing Kerr coordinates and further employ half-null, half-orthogonal tetrad\ninstead despite its seemingly complex structure. ZAMO is a \"FIDO\" (fiducial observer) and\n\u1ebd\u03bc(t) = u\u03bc (in \u1ebd(t) = \u1ebd\u03bc(t) \u2202\u03bc ) is its 4-velocity whose pathological behavior near the horizon\nneeds to be regularized, for instance, by \u1ebd\u03bc(t) \u2192 \u03b1\u1ebd\u03bc(t) = (\u2202/\u2202t)\u03bc + \u03a9(\u2202/\u2202 \u03c6\u0303)\u03bc . Obviously,\nthis regularized 4-velocity of ZAMO becomes, at the horizon, Killing vector normal to the\n2\nhorizon, \u03c7\u0303\u03bc = (\u2202/\u2202t)\u03bc + \u03a9H (\u2202/\u2202 \u03c6\u0303)\u03bc (with \u03a9H = a/(r+\n+ a2 ) being the angular velocity of\n\nthe horizon) and hence is null. Only after this regularization, the (dual) of ZAMO tetrad is\nnow made to be well-defined at the future horizon and then can be used, say, to read out\n14\n\n\fphysical components of a given tensor via eq.(5).\nWe now consider this standard procedure toward the study of electrodynamics in the background of Kerr black hole geometry by employing, instead, Damour's quasi-orthonormal\ntetrad in ingoing Kerr coordinates. The first thing that can be noticed is the fact that\nthe 4-velocity of a local observer in this quasi-orthonormal frame, e\u03bcv\u0302 (in ev\u0302 = e\u03bcv\u0302 \u2202\u03bc ) becomes, at the horizon where \u2206 = 0, at once, the usual Killing vector normal to the horizon,\n\u03c7\u03bc = (\u2202/\u2202v)\u03bc + \u03a9H (\u2202/\u2202\u03c6)\u03bc which has no pathological behavior whatsoever. Thus we do\nnot need any ad hoc regularization prescription. As we have carefully discussed earlier in\nthe derivation of Hawking-Hartle (or Teukolsky) tetrad, it is interesting to note that this\nregular behavior of the 4-velocity at the horizon is due to neither the choice of ingoing Kerr\ncoordinates (which is known to be well-behaved at the horizon) nor the employment of the\n(half) null nature of the tetrad but really due to the action of \"null rotation III\" in which\nparticularly the associated orthonormal tetrad is boosted in the er\u0302 -direction with 3-velocity\n(\u039b2 \u2212 1)/(\u039b2 + 1) with \u039b = \u2206/2(r 2 + a2 ). Namely the lesson there was that simply taking\nnull tetrad is not enough and in order to get a well-behaved null tetrad at the horizon, one\nneeds to boost it by an amount that becomes suitably infinite on the horizon. Having a\nwell-behaved tetrad (at the horizon) in our possession, we now can proceed and calculate\n\"physical\" components of any given tensor by projecting its components onto this quasiorthonormal tetrad frame. To summarize, in this comparison between the choice of ZAMO\nin Boyer-Lindquist coordinates and that of Damour's quasi- orthonormal tetrad in ingoing\nKerr coordinates, it appears that the latter is physically more relevant in that it has been\nconstructed in a more natural manner than the former which, for regularity at the horizon,\ninvolves somewhat ad hoc prescription. Thus in the present work, we choose to work with\nDamour's quasi-orthonormal tetrad in ingoing Kerr coordinates and try to read out physical components of all tensors involved. For example, physical components of Maxwell field\nstrength and electric current 4-vector will be identified with FAB = F\u03bc\u03bd (e\u03bcA e\u03bdB ), J A = J \u03bc eA\n\u03bc\nrespectively.\n\n15\n\n\fIII. Identification of electric and magnetic fields on the horizon\nAs stated, our major concern in the present work is the derivation of curious boundary\nconditions for electromagnetic fields at the horizon but in the context of non-linear BI\nelectrodynamics. As we shall see in a moment, the highly non-linear BI equations can be\nmade to take on a seemingly linear structure similar to that of Maxwell equations. And to\nthis end, we need to introduce two species of field strength tensors ; the new one G\u03bc\u03bd for\nthe inhomogeneous BI field equations and the usual one F\u03bc\u03bd for the homogeneous Bianchi\nidentity. Despite this added technical complexity, however, the basic field quantities, namely\nthe physical (finite and non-zero) components of electric field and magnetic induction can\nstill be extracted from the standard field strength F\u03bc\u03bd . Thus before we go on, it might be\nrelevant to remind two alternative typical procedures by which one can read off physical\ncomponents of electric field and magnetic induction from F\u03bc\u03bd , generally. Obviously, the first\nprocedure involves the projection of components of F\u03bc\u03bd onto the orthonormal tetrad frame\nchosen, FAB = F\u03bc\u03bd (e\u03bcA e\u03bdB ) as given above. Since A,B are now tangent space indices in this\nlocally-flat tetrad frame, the physical electric and magnetic field components then can be\nread off in a standard manner as\nFAB = {Fi0 , Fij }\nwhere\nEi = Fi0 ,\n\n(19)\n\n1\n1\nBi = \u01ebijk F jk = \u01eb0ijk F jk = F\u03030i = \u2212F\u0303i0 .\n2\n2\nThe second alternative but equivalent procedure can be described as follows. Consider a\nfamily of fiducial observers (FIDOs) whose worldlines are a congruence of timelike curves\northogonal to spacelike hypersurfaces. Let u\u03bc be the 4-velocity of a FIDO normalized as\nu\u03b1 u\u03b1 = \u22121. Since, by definition, all the physically meaningful measurements should be\nmade by these FIDOs, one can expect that the local values of the electric and magnetic\nfields measured by a FIDO with 4-velocity would be given by\n16\n\n\fE \u03b1 = F \u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b2 ,\n\n(20)\n\n1\nB \u03b1 = \u2212 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb\u03c3 u\u03b2 F\u03bb\u03c3 = \u2212F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b2\n2\nor\nF \u03b1\u03b2 = u\u03b1 E \u03b2 \u2212 E \u03b1 u\u03b2 + \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb\u03c3 u\u03bbB\u03c3 .\nIn addition, since both the electric and the magnetic fields are purely spatial vectors, one\nmay expect\nu\u03b1 E \u03b1 = 0 = u\u03b1 B \u03b1 .\n\n(21)\n\nFinally, we project E \u03bc = (0, E i ) and B \u03bc = (0, B i ) onto the orthonormal tetrad frame\nassociated with this FIDO to get their physical (finite and non-zero) components\n\u03bc\nE A = eA\n\u03bcE ,\n\n\u03bc\nB A = eA\n\u03bcB\n\n(22)\n\nthen Ei = E i , Bi = B i where A = (0, i). Thus in order to evaluate physical components of\nelectric field and magnetic induction (Ei , Bi ), one may choose between these two procedures\nand in the present work, where the quasi-orthonormal tetrad of Damour is already available,\nwe shall employ the first procedure for actual calculations.\n1. Brief review of BI electrodynamics in curved spacetimes\nEventually for the exploration of boundary conditions for BI electromagnetic fields at\nthe horizon of Kerr hole, we now briefly describe general formulation of BI theory in a\ngiven curved spacetime. Since this BI theory of electromagnetism is, despite its long history\nand physically interesting motivations behind it, not well-known and hence might be rather\nunfamiliar to relativists and workers in theoretical astrophysics community, we provide an\nintroductory review of BI theory in flat spacetime in Appendix. For a recent study of this flat\nspacetime BI theory particularly in modern field theory perspective, we also refer the reader\nto [15]. In our discussion below, however, we are implicitly aimed at adapting the theory\nto the formulation of electrodynamics in a rotating uncharged black hole spacetime. Also\nat this point in seems worthy of mention that throughout, we will be assuming the \"weak\n17\n\n\ffield limit\". To be a little more concrete, we consider the dynamics of electromagnetic field\ngoverned by the BI theory in the background of uncharged Kerr black hole spacetime. And\nwe assume that the strength of this external electromagnetic field is small enough not to\nhave any sizable backreaction to the background geometry. Then this means we are not\nconsidering a phenomena described by solutions in coupled full Einstein-BI theory but an\nenvironment where the test electromagnetic field possesses dynamics governed by the BI\ntheory rather than by the Maxwell theory. Also note that this assumption can be further\njustified as long as we confine our concern to the electrodynamics around the \"uncharged\"\nKerr black hole. If, instead, one is interested in the same physics but in charged rotating\nblack holes (which, however, is rather uninteresting since it is less likely to happen in realistic\nastrophysical environments where the black hole charge, if any, gets quickly neutralized by\nthe surrounding plasma), one would have to deal with the full Einstein-BI theory in which,\nunfortunately, the charged rotating black hole solution is not available.\nThus we consider here the action of (4-dimensional) BI theory in a fixed background spacetime with metric g\u03bc\u03bd . And to do so, some explanatory comments might be relevant. Coupling\nthe BI gauge theory to gravity is not so familiar and hence we start first with the BI theory\naction in 4-dim. flat spacetime.\nS=\n\nZ\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\uf8ee\n\nv\nu\n\n\"\n\ns\n\n!\uf8f9\n\nu\n1\n1\nd4 x \u03b2 2 \uf8f01 \u2212 t\u2212det \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + F\u03bc\u03bd \uf8fb\n4\u03c0\n\u03b2\n\n1\nd x \u03b22 1 \u2212\n4\u03c0\n4\n\n\u00112\n1 \u0010\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\nF\nF\u0303\n1 + 2 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\u03bc\u03bd\n2\u03b2\n16\u03b2 4\n\n#\n\nand then elevate it to its curved spacetime version by employing the minimal coupling\nscheme.

Note that this Bianchi identity is just\na geometrical equation independent of the detailed nature of a gauge theory action. Thus\nit remains the same as that in Maxwell theory. For later use, we also provide the energymomentum tensor of this BI theory,\n2 \u03b4S\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u221a\ng \u03b4g \u03bc\u03bd\n(\n\"\n#)\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2 (1 \u2212 R)g\u03bc\u03bd +\nF\u03bc\u03b1 F\u03bd \u2212 2 (F\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0303 )F\u03bc\u03b1 F\u0303\u03bd\n=\n4\u03c0\nR\n4\u03b2\nh\n\nwhere R \u2261 1 +\n\n1\n(F\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 )\n2\u03b2 2\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n(F\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 )2\n16\u03b2 4\n\ni1/2\n\n(26)\n\n. Now the first thing that one can readily\n\nnotice in this rather unfamiliar BI theory of electrodynamics might be the fact that even\nin the absence of the source current, the dynamical BI field equation and the geometrical\nBianchi identity clearly are not dual to each other under F\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd and F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 \u2212F\u03bc\u03bd .\nObviously, this is in contrast to what happens in the standard Maxwell theory and can\nbe attributed to the fact that when passing from the Maxwell to this highly non-linear BI\ntheory, only the dynamical field equation undergoes non-trivial change (\"non-linearization\")\nand the geometrical Bianchi identity, as pointed out above, remains unchanged. Therefore\nin order to deal with this added complexity properly and formulate the BI theory in curved\nbackground spacetime in a manner parallel to that for the standard Maxwell theory, we find\nit relevant to introduce another field strength G\u03bc\u03bd which, however, is made up of F\u03bc\u03bd and\nF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd . To be more precise, consider introducing, for the inhomogeneous BI field equation,\n19\n\n\fG\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\"\n\n1\n1\nF\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2 (F\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 )F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n=\nR\n4\u03b2\n\n#\n\n(27)\n\nand defining the associated fields on each spacelike hypersurfaces, (D \u03b1 , H \u03b1) as\nD \u03b1 = G\u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b2 ,\n\n(28)\n\n1\nH \u03b1 = \u2212 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb\u03c3 u\u03b2 G\u03bb\u03c3 = \u2212G\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b2\n2\nwhich also implies their purely spatial nature\nu\u03b1 D \u03b1 = 0 = u\u03b1 H \u03b1 .\n\n(29)\n\nAs before, u\u03bc here is the 4-velocity of FIDO (or more precisely ZAMO for rotating Kerr\ngeometry) having a timelike geodesic orthogonal to spacelike hypersurfaces. Then the inhomogeneous BI field equation now takes the form\n\u2207\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd = 4\u03c0J \u03bc\n\n(30)\n\nwhich relates the fields (D \u03bc , H \u03bc ) as defined above to \"free\" charge and current J \u03bc = \u03c1e u\u03bc +je\u03bc .\nDespite this extra elaboration, the fundamental field quantities, namely the electric field and\nthe magnetic induction still can be identified with\nE \u03b1 = F \u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b2 ,\n\n(31)\n\n1\nB \u03b1 = \u2212 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb\u03c3 u\u03b2 F\u03bb\u03c3 = \u2212F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 u\u03b2\n2\nwhich, as before, implies u\u03b1 E \u03b1 = 0 = u\u03b1 B \u03b1 . Thus the homogeneous Bianchi identity\nequation\n\u2207\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 0\n\n(32)\n\nis expressible in terms of usual (E \u03bc , B \u03bc ) fields. Then in this new representation of a set of BI\nequations, we now imagine their space-plus-time decomposition. Obviously, the dynamical\nBI field equation would split up into two inhomogeneous equations involving (D \u03bc , H \u03bc ) and\nthe \"free\" source charge and current J \u03bc = \u03c1e u\u03bc +je\u03bc whereas the geometrical Bianchi identity\n20\n\n\fequation decomposes into two homogeneous equations involving (E \u03bc , B \u03bc ). Incidentally, one\ncan then realize that this indeed is reminiscent of Maxwell equations in a \"medium\". Namely,\nin this new representation, the BI theory of electrodynamics can be thought of as taking\non the structure of ordinary Maxwell electrodynamics in a medium with non-trivial electric\nsusceptibility and magnetic permeability. In this interpretation of the new representation\nof the BI theory, then, it is evident that the system is of course not linear in that (D \u03bc , H \u03bc)\nand (E \u03bc , B \u03bc ) are related by\n\"\n\n#\n\n1\n1\nD\u03bc =\nE \u03bc + 2 (E\u03b1 B \u03b1 )B \u03bc ,\nR\n\u03b2\n\"\n#\n1\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\n\u03bc\nH =\nB \u2212 2 (E\u03b1 B )E ,\nR\n\u03b2\n\"\n\n1\n1\nwith R = 1 \u2212 2 (E\u03b1 E \u03b1 \u2212 B\u03b1 B \u03b1 ) \u2212 4 (E\u03b1 B \u03b1 )2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\n(33)\n#1/2\n\nor inversely\n\"\n\n#\n\n1\n1\nE =\nD \u03bc \u2212 2 (D\u03b1 H \u03b1 )H \u03bc ,\nR\n\u03b2\n\"\n#\n1\n1\nH \u03bc + 2 (D\u03b1 H \u03b1 )D \u03bc ,\nB\u03bc =\nR\n\u03b2\n\u03bc\n\n\"\n\n1\n1\nwith R = 1 \u2212 2 (H\u03b1 H \u03b1 \u2212 D\u03b1 D \u03b1 ) \u2212 4 (D\u03b1 H \u03b1 )2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\n(34)\n#1/2\n\nwhere we usued eqs.(27),(28) and (31) and u\u03b1 u\u03b1 = \u22121, F\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 = \u22122(E\u03b1 E \u03b1 \u2212 B\u03b1 B \u03b1 ) and\nF\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 = 4E\u03b1 B \u03b1 . It is also noteworthy from above expressions that\nE\u03b1 B \u03b1 = D\u03b1 H \u03b1 .\n\n(35)\n\nThus from now on, we may call D \u03bc = (0, D i ) as the \"electric displacement\" 4-vector and\nH \u03bc = (0, H i ) as the \"magnetic field strength\" 4-vector.\n2. Electric field and magnetic induction on the horizon\nEarlier, we mentioned that we shall employ, between the two alternative procedures to\nevaluate \"physical\" components of electric field and magnetic induction, the first one. In the\ncontext of BI theory of electrodynamics, however, there are a set of fields D \u03bc = (0, D i = Di ),\n21\n\n\fH \u03bc = (0, H i = Hi ) in addition to E \u03bc = (0, E i = Ei ), B \u03bc = (0, B i = Bi ). Then we\nshall first evaluate (Di , Hi ) on the horizon and then from them identify (Ei , Bi ) afterwards.\nWith respect to Damour's quasi-orthonormal tetrad, the physical components of electric\ndisplacement Di and magnetic field strength Hi can be read off as\nGAB = G\u03bc\u03bd (e\u03bcA e\u03bdB )\n\nand\n\n1\nHi = \u01ebijk Gjk = \u2212G\u0303i0 .\n2\n\nDi = Gi0 ,\n\n(36)\n\nMore concretely, since we are working in ingoing Kerr coordinates (v, r, \u03b8, \u03c6), the components\nof electric displacement on the horizon can be read off as\nDr\u0302 = D1 = G10 = G\u03bc\u03bd (e\u03bc1 e\u03bd0 )|r+\n(r 2 + a2 )\na\n= +\nGrv + 2\nGr\u03c6 ,\n\u03a3+\n(r+ + a2 )\n\"\n\n#\n\nD\u03b8\u0302 = D2 = G20 = G\u03bc\u03bd (e\u03bc2 e\u03bd0 )|r+\n1\n\n=\n\n1/2\n\n\"\n\n#\n\na\nG\u03b8\u03c6 ,\nG\u03b8v + 2\n(r+ + a2 )\n\n\u03a3+\nD\u03c6\u0302 = D3 = G30 = G\u03bc\u03bd (e\u03bc3 e\u03bd0 )|r+\n\n(37)\n\n1/2\n\n=\n\n\u03a3+\nG\u03c6v\n2\n(r+ + a2 ) sin \u03b8\n\n2\nwhere \u03a3+ \u2261 (r+\n+ a2 cos2 \u03b8). Next, the components of magnetic field strength again on the\n\nhorizon can be read off as\nHr\u0302 = H1 = \u2212G\u030310 = G23 = G23\n= G\u03bc\u03bd (e\u03bc2 e\u03bd3 )|r+ =\n\n1\n[a sin2 \u03b8G\u03b8v + G\u03b8\u03c6 ],\n\u03a3+ sin \u03b8\n\nH\u03b8\u0302 = H2 = \u2212G\u030320 = G31 = G30\n= D\u03c6\u0302 =\nH\u03c6\u0302 = H3 =\n\n1/2\n\u03a3+\nG\u03c6v ,\n2\n(r+\n+ a2 ) sin \u03b8\n\u2212G\u030330 = G12 = G02\n\n= \u2212D\u03b8\u0302 = \u2212\n\n1\n\n1/2\n\n\u03a3+\n\n\"\n\na\nG\u03b8v + 2\nG\u03b8\u03c6\n(r+ + a2 )\n\n(38)\n\n#\n\nwhere we used the Damour's quasi-orthonormal tetrad metric\nds2 = 2e0 e1 + e2 e2 + e3 e3 = \u01ebAB eA eB\n22\n\n\fto deduce\nG23 = \u01eb2A \u01eb3B GAB = G23 ,\nG31 = \u01eb3A \u01eb1B GAB = G30 ,\nG12 = \u01eb1A \u01eb2B GAB = G02 .\nThus it is interesting to note that on the horizon H\u03b8\u0302 = D\u03c6\u0302 and H\u03c6\u0302 = \u2212D\u03b8\u0302 or in a vector\nnotation in a tangent space to the horizon,\n~H = D\n~ H \u00d7 n\u0302\nH\n\n(39)\n\nwhere n\u0302 = r\u0302 is the vector (outer) normal to the horizon. This relation indicates that\n~ H, D\n~ H , n\u0302} form a \"triad\" on the horizon and hence constitutes the so-called \"radiative\n{H\ningoing (or, inward Poynting flux)\" boundary condition at horizon as seen by a local observer\nat rest in the quasi-orthonormal tetrad frame. Here, however, it seems worthy of note that\nalthough this relation is one of the horizon boundary conditions eventually we are after, it\nhas not been obtained essentially from the horizon specifics. As a matter of fact, it holds\nfor any r = const. sections and indeed its emergence can be attributed to the \"half-null\"\n(e\u03bc0 = l\u03bc , e\u03bc1 = \u2212n\u03bc ) structure of Damour's quasi-orthonormal tetrad. Given the observation\nthat the same type of relation as this \"radiative ingoing boundary condition\" actually holds\nfor any null surface, one might wonder what then would be the distinctive nature of the\nevent horizon (among null surfaces) that actually endows this boundary condition with real\nphysical meaning. Znajek [5] provided one possible answer to this question and it is : the\nspecial feature of the event horizon over all other null surfaces is that it is a \"stationary\" null\nsurface and there is a natural class of time coordinates associated with the frame at infinity\nin which the black hole is at rest. And the physical components of electric and magnetic\nfields should be evaluated, in a unique way, in a frame at rest on the horizon. At this point,\nwe remark on another crucial thing happening at the horizon. Namely we note that at the\nhorizon,\nB\n\u03b1 \u03b2\nD\u03b1 H \u03b1 = g\u03b1\u03b2 D \u03b1 H \u03b2 = (\u01ebAB eA\n\u03b1 e\u03b2 )D H\n\n23\n\n\f= \u01ebAB D A H B = D 0 H 1 + D 1 H 0 + D 2 H 2 + D 3 H 3 = D 2 D 3 \u2212 D 3 D 2 = 0,\nB\n\u03b1 \u03b2\nD\u03b1 D \u03b1 = g\u03b1\u03b2 D \u03b1 D \u03b2 = (\u01ebAB eA\n\u03b1 e\u03b2 )D D\n\n(40)\n\n= \u01ebAB D A D B = D 0 D 1 + D 1 D 0 + D 2 D 2 + D 3 D 3 = D 2 D 2 + D 3 D 3\n= H 3H 3 + H 2 H 2 = \u01ebAB H A H B = g\u03b1\u03b2 H \u03b1 H \u03b2 = H\u03b1 H \u03b1 .\nThese relations also holds not only at the horizon but on any r = const. sections and\nagain can be attributed to the half-null nature of Damour's quasi-orthonormal tetrad. One\nimmediate consequence of these relations D\u03b1 H \u03b1 = 0 and D\u03b1 D \u03b1 = H\u03b1 H \u03b1 everywhere is that\npractically E \u03bc = D \u03bc and B \u03bc = H \u03bc everywhere (due to eqs. (33) and (34)) as seen by a local\nobserver at rest in the quasi-orthonormal tetrad frame. In fact, the interpretation of this\nis straightforward. Since Damour's quasi-orthonormal tetrad is half-null in (v \u2212 r) sector,\nan observer in this tetrad frame is actually a null observer who, as a result of his motion,\nwould see the electromagnetic field around him as a \"radiation field\" all the way which,\nin turn, turns the BI theory of electrodynamics effectively into the Maxwell theory. What\nis particularly remarkable concerning this study of electrodynamics in the background of\nKerr black hole in the context of BI theory is that the nature of the theory or the concrete\nstructure of BI equations happens to be such that it is indistinguishable to a local observer\nin Damour's quasi-orthonormal tetrad frame (indeed to any null observers) from that of\nstandard Maxwell theory. This point is indeed quite amusing on theoretical side. From now\non, then, whenever we deal with quantities involving physical components of fields as seen\nby this observer in Damour's tetrad frame, we can freely replace (D \u03bc (E \u03bc ), H \u03bc (B \u03bc )) by\n(E \u03bc (D \u03bc ), B \u03bc (H \u03bc )). Thus the radiative ingoing boundary condition at the horizon obtained\nabove can be given in terms of electric field and magnetic induction as\n~H = E\n~ H \u00d7 n\u0302.\nB\n\n(41)\n\nAs pointed out earlier, this relation states that the electric and magnetic fields tangential to\nthe horizon are equal in magnitude and perpendicular in direction and hence their Poynting\nenergy flux is into the hole. This boundary condition as seen by a local observer again in a\n24\n\n\fnull tetrad frame (which has been made to be well-behaved at the horizon by the amount of\nboost that becomes suitably infinite at the horizon) has been derived first by Znajek [5] in\nthe context of standard Maxwell theory and here we just witnessed that precisely the same\nradiative ingoing boundary condition holds in the BI theory context as well.\nIV. (Fictitious) Charge and current on the horizon\nIt is well appreciated that in any attempt to have an intuitive picture of Blandford-Znajek\nprocess for the rotational energy extraction from rotating black holes, the introduction of\nsurface charge and current density on the (stretched) horizon proves to be quite convenient.\nFor instance, the circuit analysis in the membrane paradigm [11] cannot do without the\nnotion of the horizon surface charge and current density. If one follows the original argument\nof Damour [6], one can justify their introduction as follows. Suppose the existence of a 4current J \u03bc (v, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) which is defined and conserved all over the spacetime. Let r = r+ be\nthe location of an event horizon, then obviously some charge and current can plunge into the\nhole and disappear from the region r > r+ . Nevertheless, imagine that we do not want to\nconsider what happens inside the black hole (r < r+ ) and just wish to keep the charge and\ncurrent conserved in the region r > r+ . Then we would have to endow the surface r = r+\nwith charge and current densities in such a way that the real current outside the horizon\nand this fictitious current on the horizon together can complete the circuit. Then the task\nof constructing the horizon surface current can be described as a mathematical problem as\nfollows : \"Given the bulk current J \u03bc (v, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) such that \u2207\u03bc J \u03bc = 0, find a complementary\nboundary (surface) current j \u03bc on the surface r = r+ such that I \u03bc \u2261 [J \u03bc Y (r \u2212 r+ ) + j \u03bc ]\n(where Y (r) is the Heaviside function defined by dY (r) = \u03b4(r)dr) is conserved.\" And in\nthis problem, a crucial point to be noted is that the conservation of the bulk current J \u03bc\nis ensured by the field equation. Obviously then, what changes from the ordinary Maxwell\ntheory case to the present BI theory case is that now the conservation of J \u03bc is secured by\nthe inhomogeneous BI field equation instead of the Maxwell equation, i.e.,\n\u2207\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd = 4\u03c0J \u03bc\n25\n\n(42)\n\n\fimplies \u2207\u03bc J \u03bc = \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd /4\u03c0 = 0 outside the horizon. Then the condition for the conservation of the total current I \u03bc reads\n0 = \u2207\u03bc I \u03bc = \u2207\u03bc [J \u03bc Y (r \u2212 r+ ) + j \u03bc ]\n=\n\n1\nx\u03bc\n\u03b4(r \u2212 r+ ) + \u2207\u03bc j \u03bc\n(\u2207\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd )\n4\u03c0\nr\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(43)\n\nwhere we used \u2207\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd = 4\u03c0J \u03bc , \u2207\u03bc J \u03bc = 0 and \u2202\u03bc Y = (x\u03bc /r)\u03b4(r \u2212 r+ ). Obviously, this\nequation is solved by the complementary surface current given as\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\nG (\u2202\u03bd r)\u03b4(r \u2212 r+ )\n4\u03c0\n1 \u03bcr\n\u2261\nG \u03b4(r \u2212 r+ ).\n4\u03c0\n\nj\u03bc =\n\n(44)\n\nFurther, it is convenient to introduce a \"Dirac distribution\" \u03b4H on the horizon normalized\nwith respect to the time at infinity v and the local proper area dA such that\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd4 x g \u03b4H \u03b4(v \u2212 v0 )f (v, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) =\n\nZ\n\nH\n\ndA f (v0 , r+ , \u03b8, \u03c6)\n\n(45)\n\nwhich, then, yields\n\u03b4H =\nwhere we used\n\n\u221a\n\n2\n(r+\n+ a2 )\n\u03b4(r \u2212 r+ )\n\u03a3+\n\n(46)\n\n2\ng = \u03a3 sin \u03b8 and dA = (r+\n+ a2 ) sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6. Finally, then, the complementary\n\nsurface current 4-vector on the horizon can be written as j \u03bc = \u03ba\u03bc \u03b4H with\n\u03ba\u03bc =\n\n\u03a3+\n1\nG\u03bcr .\n2\n4\u03c0 (r+ + a2 ) +\n\n(47)\n\nAs usual, what matters is the identification of \"physical\" (i.e., finite and non-zero) components of this current 4-vector (i.e., the horizon charge and current density) as seen by an\nobserver in our quasi-orthonormal tetrad frame. And they can be computed, using the dual\nof Damour's mixed tetrad given in eq.(16), in a straightforward manner as\n1 vr\n[G+ \u2212 a sin2 \u03b8G\u03c6r\n+]\n4\u03c0\n\"\n#\n2\n1 (r+\n+ a2 )\na\n1\n=\nGrv +\nGr\u03c6 =\nDr\u0302 ,\n4\u03c0\n\u03a3+\n\u03a3+\n4\u03c0\n\n\u03c3 = \u03ba0 = \u03ba\u03bc e0\u03bc |r+ =\n\n26\n\n\f\u03bar\u0302 = \u03ba1 = \u03ba\u03bc e1\u03bc |r+ = 0,\n\u03ba\u03b8\u0302 = \u03ba2 = \u03ba\u03bc e2\u03bc |r+ =\n\n(48)\n3/2\n\n\u03a3+\n1\nG\u03b8r\n2\n4\u03c0 (r+ + a2 ) +\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\n1 \uf8f0 1\n1\na\n=\nG\u03b8\u03c6 \uf8fb =\nD,\nG\u03b8v + 1/2\n1/2\n2\n4\u03c0 \u03a3+\n4\u03c0 \u03b8\u0302\n\u03a3+ (r+\n+ a2 )\n1/2\n\n\u03ba\u03c6\u0302 = \u03ba3 = \u03ba\u03bc e3\u03bc |r+ =\n\n1\n\u03a3+\n\u03c6r\n2\n2\n[\u2212a sin \u03b8Gvr\n+ + (r+ + a ) sin \u03b8G+ ]\n2\n4\u03c0 (r+ + a2 )\n\n1/2\n\n1\n1\n\u03a3+\n=\nG\u03c6v =\nD\n2\n2\n4\u03c0 (r+ + a ) sin \u03b8\n4\u03c0 \u03c6\u0302\nwhere the subscript \"+\" denotes the value at the horizon r = r+ and we compared these\nequations with eq.(37) to relate the surface charge and current densities to the components\nof electric displacement on the horizon.\nV. Ohm's law, Gauss' law, and Ampere's law\nWe now are in the position to demonstrate that, as results of central significance, a set\nof three relations, at the horizon, between the fields (Di = Ei , Hi = Bi ) and the surface\ncharge and current densities (\u03c3 = \u03ba0 , \u03bai ) that can be thought of as Ohm's law, Gauss' law\nand Ampere's law valid at the horizon of a rotating Kerr black hole. First, notice that\nD\u03b8\u0302 = 4\u03c0\u03ba\u03b8\u0302 ,\n\nD\u03c6\u0302 = 4\u03c0\u03ba\u03c6\u0302 .\n\n(49)\n\nThese relations can be rewritten in a vector notation in a tangent space to the horizon as\n~ H = 4\u03c0~\u03ba or E\n~ H = 4\u03c0~\u03ba\nD\n\n(50)\n\nand hence can be interpreted as the \"Ohm's law\". Namely, this relation precisely takes\non the form of a non-relativistic Ohm's law for a conductor and hence implies that if we\nendow the horizon with some charge and current densities which are to be determined by\nthe surrounding external electromagnetic field F\u03bc\u03bd , then the horizon behaves as if it is a\nconductor with finite surface resistivity of\n\u03c1 = 4\u03c0 \u2243 377(ohms).\n27\n\n(51)\n\n\fThe derivation of Ohm's law and this value of surface resistivity has been performed first\nby Damour [6] and by Znajek [5] independently in the context of standard Maxwell theory.\nThus what is indeed remarkable here is that the Ohm's law above and the value of horizon's\nsurface resistivity (4\u03c0) remain unchanged even when we replace the Maxwell theory by\nthe BI theory of electrodynamics. This result cannot be naturally anticipated but close\ninspection reveals that it can be attributed to the peculiar structure of highly non-linear\ninhomogeneous BI field equation given in eqs.(30) and (27) which, at the horizon, shows\n~ H)\n~ fields become exactly the same as (E,\n~ B)\n~ as seen\nsome magic such that there the (D,\nby a local observer in Damour's tetrad frame respectively as can be checked from eqs.(34)\nand (38) (or (40)). As Damour [6] pointed out, this result constitutes a clear confirmation\nof Carter's assertion [10] that a black hole is analogous to an ordinary object having finite\nviscosity and electrical conductivity. Next, we also notice that\nDr\u0302 = 4\u03c0\u03c3\n\nor Er\u0302 = 4\u03c0\u03c3\n\n(52)\n\nwhich evidently can be identified with the surface version of Gauss' law. It says that the\nfictitious surface charge density we assumed on the horizon plays the role of terminating the\nnormal components of all electric fields that pierce the horizon just as we want it to. Lastly, if\nwe combine the radiative ingoing boundary condition at the horizon that we obtained earlier,\n~H = D\n~ H \u00d7 n\u0302 (or B\n~H = E\n~ H \u00d7 n\u0302) and the Ohm's law above, D\n~ H = 4\u03c0~\u03ba (or E\n~ H = 4\u03c0~\u03ba), we\nH\nend up with the third relation\n~ H = 4\u03c0(~\u03ba \u00d7 n\u0302) or B\n~ H = 4\u03c0(~\u03ba \u00d7 n\u0302)\nH\n\n(53)\n\nwhich may be viewed as the surface version of Ampere's law. Again, consistently with our\nmotivation for introducing fictitious current density on the horizon, this relation indicates\nthat the current density we assumed plays the role of terminating any tangential components\nof all magnetic fields penetrating the horizon. To summarize, for the reason stated earlier,\neven the highly non-linear BI theory of electrodynamics leads to the same horizon boundary\nconditions eqs.(41), (50), (52), and (53) as those in the standard Maxwell theory and indeed\n28\n\n\fthis set of four curious boundary conditions on the horizon actually have provided the\nmotivation for the proposal of membrane paradigm [11] of black holes later on.\nVI. Joule's law or Ohmic dissipation at the horizon\nPerhaps one of the most intriguing consequences of assuming the existence of fictitious\ncharge and current densities on the horizon would be that if we choose to do so, the horizon\nbehaves as if it is a conductor with finite conductivity as we stressed in the previous section.\nSince it is the surrounding external electromagnetic field that drives the surface currents on\nthe horizon, one might naturally wonder what would happen to the Joule heat generated\nwhen those currents work against the surface resistance and how it would be related to the\nelectromagnetic energy going down the hole through the horizon. Znajek and Damour also\nprovided a simple and natural answer to this question. Namely, they showed in a consistent\nand elegant manner that the total electromagnetic energy flux (i.e., the Poynting flux) into\nthe rotating Kerr hole through the horizon is indeed precisely the same as the amount of\nJoule heat produced by the surface currents when they work against the surface resistivity\nof 4\u03c0. In the following, we shall demonstrate again along the same line of formulation as\nDamour that indeed the same is true even in the context of BI theory of electrodynamics.\nIt is well-known that for a stationary, axisymmetric black hole spacetime with the horizonorthogonal Killing field\n\u03c7\u03bc = (\u2202/\u2202v)\u03bc + \u03a9H (\u2202/\u2202\u03c6)\u03bc \u2261 \u03be \u03bc + \u03a9H \u03c8 \u03bc\n\n(54)\n\nthe mass-energy and the angular momentum flux into the hole through the horizon are given\nrespectively by\nZ\nZ\ndM\n=\ndA T\u03bd\u03bc \u03be \u03bd \u03c7\u03bc =\ndA Tv\u03bc \u03c7\u03bc ,\ndv\nH\nH\nZ\nZ\ndJz\n\u03bc \u03bd\n= \u2212 dA T\u03bd \u03c8 \u03c7\u03bc = \u2212 dA T\u03c6\u03bc \u03c7\u03bc\ndv\nH\nH\n\n(55)\n\n2\nwhere dA = (r+\n+a2 ) sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6 is again the area element on the horizon and T\u03bd\u03bc is the matter\n\nenergy-momentum tensor at the horizon. Now, combining these with the 1st law of black\nhole thermodynamics [16]\n29\n\n\fdQ =\n\n1\n\u03ba\u0302H dA = dM \u2212 \u03a9H dJz\n8\u03c0\n\n(56)\n\nwhere dQ denotes the heat dissipated in the hole not charge (recall that we only consider\nhere uncharge Kerr black hole) with \u03ba\u0302H being the surface gravity [16] of the hole, one gets\ndQ\ndM\ndJz\n=\n\u2212 \u03a9H\ndv\ndv\nZdv\n=\n\nH\n\n(57)\n\ndA T\u03bd\u03bc (\u03be \u03bd + \u03a9H \u03c8 \u03bd )\u03c7\u03bc =\n\nZ\n\nH\n\ndA T\u03bd\u03bc \u03c7\u03bd \u03c7\u03bc .\n\nPerhaps a word of caution might be relevant here. As we mentioned earlier, we are only\ninterested in the \"test\" electromagnetic field whose dynamics is governed particularly by the\nBI theory in the \"background\" of uncharged Kerr black hole spacetime which is a solution to\nthe vacuum Einstein equation. Therefore, as long as we confine our concern to the case with\nuncharged Kerr black hole physics, the 1st law of black hole thermodynamics given above\nstill remains to be valid. If, instead, one is interested in the case with charged, rotating\nblack hole physics, one would have to deal with the full, coupled Einstein-BI theory context\nand then there the associated 1st law should get modified to the extended version like the\none given by Rasheed [17] recently. Now, since the \"matter\" for the case at hand is the BI\nelectromagnetic field, we have at the horizon\nT\u03bc\u03bd \u03c7\u03bc \u03c7\u03bd |r+\n\n(\n\n\"\n\n1\n1\n1\n\u03b2 2 (1 \u2212 R)\u03c7\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b1 +\nF\u03bc\u03b1 F\u03bd\u03b1 \u2212 2 (F\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 )F\u03bc\u03b1 F\u0303\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c7\u03bc \u03c7\u03bd\n=\n4\u03c0\nR\n4\u03b2\n1\n(F\u03bc\u03b1 F\u03bd\u03b1 )\u03c7\u03bc \u03c7\u03bd |r+\n=\n4\u03c0\n\n#)\n\n| r+\n(58)\n\nwhere R is as defined earlier and in the second line we used that at the horizon where\ng\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c7\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b2 = \u03c7\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b1 = 0,\nF\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 = \u22122(E\u03b1 E \u03b1 \u2212 B\u03b1 B \u03b1 ) = \u22122(D\u03b1 D \u03b1 \u2212 H\u03b1 H \u03b1 ) = 0,\nF\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 = 4E\u03b1 B \u03b1 = 4D\u03b1 H \u03b1 = 0,\n\"\n\nand hence\n\n1\n1\n(F\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 )2\nR = 1 + 2 (F\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 ) \u2212\n2\u03b2\n16\u03b2 4\n\n#1/2\n\n=1\n\nwhich also yields, at the horizon, G\u03bc\u03bd = F\u03bc\u03bd . Recall that in the standard Maxwell theory,\n30\n\n\fT\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\n1\n[F\u03bc\u03b1 F\u03bd\u03b1 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd (F\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 )]\n4\u03c0\n4\n\n(59)\n\nand thus at the horizon, T\u03bc\u03bd \u03c7\u03bc \u03c7\u03bd |r+ = (1/4\u03c0)(F\u03bc\u03b1 F\u03bd\u03b1 )\u03c7\u03bc \u03c7\u03bd |r+ , which is the same as its\ncounterpart in BI theory obtained above. This means that, at the horizon, the amount of\ntotal electromagnetic energy flux into the hole turns out to be the same and hence indistinguishable between Maxwell theory and BI theory. Further,\nT\u03bc\u03bd \u03c7\u03bc \u03c7\u03bd |r+ =\n\n1\n(F\u03bc\u03b1 F\u03bd\u03b1 )\u03c7\u03bc \u03c7\u03bd |r+\n4\u03c0 \uf8f1\n\uf8ee\n\n1/2\n\n(60)\n\uf8f92\n\n\uf8ee\n\n1 \uf8f2\uf8f0\na\n\u03a3+\n1\n=\nF\u03c6v \uf8fb + \uf8f0 1/2 G\u03b8v + 1/2\n2\n2\n\uf8f4\n2\n4\u03c0 \uf8f3 (r+ + a ) sin \u03b8\n\u03a3+\n\u03a3+ (r+\n\uf8f4\n\n= 4\u03c0[(\u03ba\u03c6\u0302 )2 + (\u03ba\u03b8\u0302 )2 ] = 4\u03c0(~\u03ba)2\n\n\uf8f92 \uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fb\nG\u03b8\u03c6\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n+ a2 )\n\nwhere we used G\u03bc\u03bd = F\u03bc\u03bd and \u03bar\u0302 = 0 at the horizon.

As we promised to demonwhere we used the Ohm's law E\nstrate, clearly this is the Joule's law which is again precisely the same as its Maxwell theory\ncounterpart originally obtained by Znajek [5] and by Damour [6] and implies that the absorption of electromagnetic energy by Kerr holes through the horizon can be translated into\nan equivalent picture in which the holes gain energy by absorbing Joule heat (or Ohmic dis~ H works against\nsipation) generated when the surface current ~\u03ba driven by the electric field E\nthe surface resistivity of 4\u03c0. And as before, what is remarkable is the fact that even if we\nreplace the Maxwell theory by the highly non-linear BI electrodynamics, the physics of the\nhorizon such as this horizon thermodynamics as well as the horizon boundary conditions\nremain unchanged. And as we pointed out earlier, this has much to do with the nature\nof Damour's quasi-orthonormal tetrad frame (i.e., its half-null structure) in ingoing Kerr\ncoordinates.\nVII. Concluding Remarks\n31\n\n\fIn the present work, we have explored the interaction of electromagnetic fields with a\nrotating (Kerr) black hole in the context of Born-Infeld (BI) theory of electromagnetism\nand particularly we have derived BI theory versions of the four horizon boundary conditions\nof Znajek and Damour. Interestingly enough, as far as we employ the same local null\ntetrad frame as the one adopted in the works by Damour and by Znajek, we ended up with\nexactly the same four horizon boundary conditions despite the shift of the electrodynamics\ntheory from a linear Maxwell one to a highly non-linear BI one. As we have seen in the\ntext, this curious and unexpected result could be attributed to the fact that the concrete\nstructure of BI equations happens to be such that it is indistinguishable at the horizon to\na local observer, say, in Damour's local tetrad frame from that of standard Maxwell theory.\nFinally, we have a word of caution to avoid a possible confusion the potential readers might\nhave. Namely, again we point out that in all the calculations involved in this work to read\noff physical components of tensors such as Maxwell field tensor and current 4-vector, we\nstrictly used the quasi-orthonormal tetrad given in eqs.(15) and (16) and nothing else. In\nthis sense, our choice of local tetrad frame was slightly different from that in the original\nwork of Damour [6] in which he introduced, particularly on the 2-dimensional, v = const.\nsection of the event horizon, some other orthonormal basis (slightly different from {e\u03bc2 , e\u03bc3 }\ngiven in eq.(15)) specially adapted to the \"intrinsic geometry\" of the v = const. section of\nthe horizon and used them to project out physical components of tensors. As such, any\ndeviation of the results one may find in the expressions for the electric field, magnetic field\nand surface charge and current densities appeared in the text of the present work from\ntheir counterparts in the original work of Damour can be attributed to this slightly different\nchoices of the local tetrad vectors. This discrepancy, however, is insensitive to the physical\nnature of this study of the horizon boundary conditions that we try to deliver in the present\nwork.\n\nAcknowledgements\n32\n\n\fThis work was supported in part by the Brain Korea 21 Project.

It probes the degree of deviation of BI gauge theory from the standard Maxwell theory\nand obviously \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e limit corresponds to the standard Maxwell theory. Again, extremzing\nthis action with respect to A\u03bc yields the dynamical BI field equation\n\uf8ee\n\n\u2202\u03bc \uf8f0 q\n1+\n\nF \u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\n1\n(F\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 )F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd\n4\u03b2 2\n\n1\nF F \u03b1\u03b2\n2\u03b2 2 \u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n(F\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 )2\n16\u03b2 4\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\n= \u2212j \u03bd .\n\n(63)\n\nIn addition to this, there is a supplementary equation coming from an identity satisfied by\nthe abelian gauge field strength tensor, \u2202\u03bb F\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bc F\u03bd\u03bb + \u2202\u03bd F\u03bb\u03bc = 0. This is the Bianchi\nidentity which is just a geometrical equation and in terms of the Hodge dual field strength,\nF\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 21 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 F\u03b1\u03b2 , it can be written as\n\u2202\u03bc F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 0\n33\n\n(64)\n\n\fAnd it seems noteworthy that the field equation for A\u03bc in eq.(63) is the dynamical field\nequation which gets determined by the concrete nature of the gauge theory action such\nas the one in eq.(62). The Bianchi identity in eq.(64), on the other hand, is simply a\ngeometrical identity and is completely independent of the choice of the context of the gauge\ntheory. Further, if one wishes to decompose these covariant equations, use \u2202 \u03bc = (\u2212\u2202/\u2202t, \u2207i ),\n\u2202\u03bc = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bd = (\u2202/\u2202t, \u2207i ) (namely, we use the sign convention, \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1)),\nA\u03bc = (\u03c6, Ai ) and the field identification, Ei = Fi0 , Bi = 21 \u01ebijk F jk or Fij = \u01ebijk B k , and write\n~ and B\n~ fields, to get\nthem in terms of E\n\"\n\n#\n\n1 ~\n1 ~ ~ ~\n\u2207*\n(E + 2 (E\n* B)B) = \u03c1e ,\nR\n\u03b2\n\"\n#\n#\n\"\n1 ~ ~ ~\n\u2202 1 ~\n1 ~ ~ ~\n1 ~\n(B \u2212 2 (E * B)E) \u2212\n(E + 2 (E * B)B) = ~je\n\u2207\u00d7\nR\n\u03b2\n\u2202t R\n\u03b2\nwhere R \u2261\n\nq\n\n1+\n\n1\nF F \u03b1\u03b2\n2\u03b2 2 \u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n(F\u03b1\u03b2 F\u0303 \u03b1\u03b2 )2\n16\u03b2 4\n\n=\n\nr\n\n1\u2212\n\n1 ~2\n(E\n\u03b22\n\n~ 2) \u2212\n\u2212B\n\n1 ~\n(E\n\u03b24\n\n(65)\n\n~ 2 for the\n* B)\n\ndynamical BI field equation and\n~\n~ + \u2202B = 0\n\u2207\u00d7E\n\u2202t\n\n~ = 0,\n\u2207*B\n\n(66)\n\n~2 \u2212 B\n~ 2 ) and\nfor the geometrical Bianchi identity and where we used F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd = \u22122(E\n~ * B.\n~\nF\u03bc\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 4E\n\nWe now start with some electrostatics described by this BI the-\n\nory.

Thus to see if this is indeed the case, consider\nthe energy-momentum tensor of this BI theory\n2\n\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b2 (1 \u2212 R)\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\"\n\n1\n1\n+\nF\u03bc\u03b1 F\u03bd\u03b1 \u2212 2 (F\u03b1\u03b2 F \u03b1\u03b2 )F\u03bc\u03b1 F\u0303\u03bd\u03b1\nR\n4\u03b2\n\n#\n\n(68)\n\nwith R as given earlier.

Lastly we turn to some electrodynamics governed by this BI theory.
