The line shape is well explained by relativistic blurring\n(Fabian et al 1989) of the X-ray reflection spectrum expected from\nthe inner accretion disc around the central black hole. The red wing\nof the line is so broad that extreme redshifts are required indicating\nthat the inner radius of the disc is close to the black hole and thus\nthat the hole is rapidly spinning (Dabrowski et al 1997; Brenneman\n& Reynolds 2006). In this case, much of the emission originates\nfrom the region where gravity is so strong that light bending is a\nlarge effect. This in turn can explain the apparently disconnected\nspectral behaviour of the source (Miniutti et al 2003; Miniutti &\nFabian 2004), with the relativistic-reflection component showing\nmuch less variation compared with the power-law continuum (Matsumoto et al 2003; Shih et al 2002; Fabian & Vaughan 2003; Larsson et al 2007). A key prediction of the disk reflection model is\nthe presence of a powerful Compton reflection hump at \u223c 20 keV\nwhich varies in step with the broad iron line; this is indeed seen in\nthe Suzaku data for this object (Miniutti et al. 2007).\nMiller, Turner & Reeves (2008, hereafter MTR) propose an alternative explanation in which the X-ray spectrum of MCG\u20136-30-\n\n\u2217 E-mail: chris@astro.umd.edu\n\n15 is sculpted by multiple absorbers. A moderately photoionized\nabsorber partially-covers the primary power-law continuum source\nproducing a 3\u20137 keV hump in the spectrum which mimics the redwing of a broadened iron line. The weak narrow iron line present\nin the spectrum is described by reflection from distant material,\nbut that reflection spectrum must then itself be absorbed by a second photoionized and marginally-Compton thick structure in order\nto correctly model the powerful 20 keV hump seen in the Suzaku\nspectrum. The MTR model requires no relativistic effects and has\nmost zones at 100rg (where the gravitational radius is defined by\nrg = GM/c2 ) or further from the black hole. We note that MTR\nadd 3% systematic error to all data before comparing the various\nmodels.\n\nIn this Letter, we address the viability of the absorptiondominated model by discussing a key constraint that is not fully\nexplored by MTR, i.e., the unavoidable connection between the\nhard X-ray hump and fluorescent iron line production. In both\nthe relativistic-reflection and the absorption-dominated models, the\nlow-energy side of the \u223c 20 keV hump is shaped by the photoelectric absorption of iron. Consequently, iron fluorescence must accompany the 20 keV hump; this is true even if there is no opticallythick reflection occurring at all. We argue that the only way to make\nthe presence of the hard X-ray hump compatible with the extremely\nweak narrow iron line is to either strongly blur much of the iron line\n\n\f2\n\nC.S. Reynolds et al.\n\n(as in the relativistic-reflection model) or postulate a very special\ngeometry for the system.\nWe present our arguments within the context of a re-analysis\nof the January-2006 Suzaku observation of MCG\u20136-30-15. Section 2 describes our reduction of these data. In Section 3, we examine the constraints imposed by relating the 20 keV hump to the\nproduction of iron line photons. The meaning of these spectral constraints on the geometry of the source are discussed in Section 4,\nand we draw our conclusions in Section 5. All error ranges are\nquoted at the 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter\n(\u2206 \u03c7 2 = 2.71).\n\n2 THE SUZAKU DATA\nTo illustrate the iron line constraints discussed in this paper in concrete terms, we re-analyze the combined data of the three Suzaku\nobservations of MCG\u20136-30-15 taken 2006 January 9\u201314 (150 ks),\n2006 January 23\u201326 (99 ks) and 2006 January 27\u201330 (97 ks). These\ndata have been previously presented by Miniutti et al. (2007).\nMCG\u20136-30-15 was placed at the nominal XIS aimpoint, and all\nfour X-ray Imaging Spectrometers (XIS0\u20133) were operational and\ncollecting data. However, following Miniutti et al. (2007) we only\nconsider data from XIS2 and XIS3 which appear to show the fewest\ncalibration artifacts. We also utilize data from the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) PIN.\nReduction started from the cleaned Version-2 data products,\nand data were further reduced using FTOOLS version 6.4 according to the standard procedure outlined in the \"Suzaku Data Reduction (ABC) Guide\". The standard filtering resulted in 338 ksec of\n\"good\" data from each XIS. Spectra were extracted from XIS2\nand XIS3 using a circular region of radius 4.3 arcmin centered\non MCG\u20136-30-15. Background spectra were obtained from circular source free regions (avoiding the calibration sources) around\nthe chip edges. Response matrices and effective area curves were\ngenerated using the xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen tools (called\nvia the xisresp script provided to us by Keith Arnaud). We use\n100,000 photons per energy bin during the construction of the effective area files. We also utilize HXD/PIN data in this paper. Standard filtering resulted in 274.2 ksec of \"good\" Suzaku-HXD/PIN\ndata from which a spectrum was constructed. A PIN background\nspectrum was produced that models non-cosmic background. The\nCosmic X-ray Background was included as an additional component to the spectral model as described in the Suzaku Data Reduction guide. Overall, our reduction repeats that of Miniutti et al.\n(2007) except for the use of updated instrumental response matrices\nand (importantly) HXD/PIN background models.\nTo avoid complexities associated with the uncontroversial\nwarm absorption components (which possess significant opacity\nonly below 2 keV), we restrict all spectral modeling discussed here\nto energies greater than 2.5 keV. Thus, we examine the 2.5\u201310 keV\nXIS2/XIS3 spectra jointly with the 14\u201360 keV HXD/PIN spectrum.\n\n3 CONNECTING THE IRON LINE AND THE 20 KEV\nBUMP\nFigure 1 (top panels) shows a fit of the relativistic-reflection model\nto these Suzaku data. In detail, the model consists of a powerlaw continuum together with an ionized disk reflection spectrum\nwhich has been blurred under the assumption that it originates from\nthe inner regions of an accretion disk around a near-maximally\n\nrotating black hole. We employ the ionized reflection models of\nRoss & Fabian (2005) and the relativistic smearing kernel of Laor\n(1991). Note that Ballantyne et al. (2001) has demonstrated that diluted constant-density ionized disk reflection models such as those\npresented by Ross & Fabian (2005) are a very good approximation to the reflection expected from the surface layers of an accretion disk in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. Following Brenneman\n& Reynolds (2006) and Miniutti et al. (2007), we also explicitly\nmodel statistically significant but weak narrow emission/absorption\nfeatures using narrow Gaussians centered at 6.4 keV (cold Fe fluorescent emission), 6.67 keV (He-like Fe absorption) and, 6.97 keV\n(H-like Fe absorption). The Ross & Fabian (2005) reflection models do not include the K\u03b2 line of cold iron at 7.1 keV; our spectral model explicitly includes an additional 7.1 keV line which is\nsmeared together with the ionized reflection model, and we see evidence for such a line in the data. The best-fit model is comparable\nto that derived by Miniutti et al. (2007); the photon index of the\nprimary power-law is \u0393 = 2.09+0.04\n\u22120.08 , the reflector has iron abundance Z = 1.8+0.3\nZ\nand\nionization\nparameter \u03be < 35 erg s\u22121 cm,\n\u2299\n\u22120.2\nand the relativistic smearing implies an inclination of i = 31 \u00b1 1\u25e6 ,\nan inner disk radius of r = 1.7 \u00b1 0.1rg and emissivity profile which\n+0.6\nbreaks from \u03b2 = 5.7 \u00b1 0.7 to \u03b2 = 2.74+0.15\n\u22120.10 at rbr = 3.8\u22120.5 rg .\nOf greatest importance to our current argument is the fact that\na powerful iron emission line accompanies the strong reflection\nhump. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 (top panels), the presence of such\na strong line is compatible with the data only because it is strongly\nsmeared by the relativistic effects. We demonstrate this more explicitly by fitting the X-ray hump with a reflection model that does\nnot include any relativistic effects, as shown in Fig. 1 (middle panels). More precisely, starting with our relativistic-reflection model,\nwe force an inner disk radius of rin = 200rg and refit the spectrum\nignoring the range of energies applicable to the broad iron line (3.5\u2013\n8 keV). As well as leaving a broad residual in the 3\u20137 keV band\n(corresponding to the broad iron line in the relativistic-reflection\nmodel), this model vastly overpredicts the narrow iron line.\nPrimarily motivated by this line-overproduction problem,\nMTR advocate a model in which the hard X-ray hump is mainly\nshaped by direct absorption rather than reflection. However, as we\nshall now show, an absorption-dominated model is still subject to\nconstraints based on iron line production.\nTo underscore our argument, we take an extreme form of the\nMTR model that should be optimized to produce the least iron\nline emission; we assume the complete absence of X-ray reflection and suppose that the hard X-ray hump is shaped entirely by\nphotoelectric absorption of the primary X-ray emission by a cold,\nhigh column density absorber. Of course, the fact that we see\nplenty of emission at low-energies shows that a significant fraction of the emission must either scatter around this absorber or\nleak through holes in this absorber, i.e., this is a partial-covering\nabsorber. Again, we fit this model to the Suzaku data ignoring\nthe 3.5\u20138 keV band. This fit implies a column density of NH =\n24\n\u22122 and a covering fraction of f = 0.35 \u00b1 0.03.\n(2.0+0.36\n\u22120.29 ) \u00d7 10 cm\nTaking this best fit model and setting f = 0, we determine that\nthe partial covering absorber is removing 7.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 ph s\u22121 cm\u22122\nfrom the spectrum in the 7.08\u201320 keV (rest-frame) band; essentially\nall of these photons are removed by iron K-shell photoelectric absorption (which has a threshold energy of 7.08 keV). Assuming for\nnow that the absorber covers fraction f = 0.35 of the sky isotropically as seen by the X-ray source, the resulting iron line emission is simply given by the product of the photoelectric absorption\nrate and the fluorescent yield; using the fluorescent yield appro-\n\n\f0.1\n10\u22124\n\n50\n\n5\n\n10\n20\nEnergy (keV)\n\n50\n\n5\n\n10\n20\nEnergy (keV)\n\n50\n\n10\n20\nEnergy (keV)\n\n50\n\n5\n\n10\n20\nEnergy (keV)\n\n50\n\n5\n\n10\n20\nEnergy (keV)\n\n50\n\n0.1\n\n5\n\ndata/model\n\n10\u22123 0.01\n0.5\n0\n\ndata/model\n\n1\n\n10\u22124\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\ncounts/s/keV\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.6 0.8 1\n\n10\u22124\n\n10\u22123 0.01\n\ncounts/s/keV\n\n0.01\n5\u00d710\n\n\u22123\n\n\u03bdF(\u03bd)\n\n0.6 0.8 1\n\ndata/model\n\n10\n20\nEnergy (keV)\n\n0.02\n\n5\n\n5\u00d710\u22123\n\n\u03bdF(\u03bd)\n\n3\n\n10\u22123 0.01\n\ncounts/s/keV\n\n0.01\n5\u00d710\n\n\u22123\n\n\u03bdF(\u03bd)\n\n0.02\n\nConstraints on the absorption-dominated model for the X-ray spectrum of MCG\u20136-30-15\n\nFigure 1.

If we allow the\nnormalization of the narrow iron line to be free in the fit to\n\nthe Suzaku data, the observed excess at 6.4 keV (which, in the\nrelativistic-reflection model corresponds to the blue-horn of the\nbroad iron line) has a photon flux of 2.50 \u00d7 10\u22125 photon s\u22121 cm\u22122 ;\nthis implies that the Compton thick absorber covers only 0.1 f =\n0.035 of the sky as seen by the X-ray source. This is robust to\nthe addition or omission of a second partial covering absorber\nto mimic the broad iron line. If, instead, we use the strength\nof the narrow 6.4 keV iron emission line seen by the Chan-\n\n\f4\n\nC.S. Reynolds et al.\n\ndra/HETG (Young et al. 2005), the corresponding photon flux\n(1.24\u00d710\u22125 photon s\u22121 cm\u22122 ) requires a covering fraction of only\n0.05 f = 0.0175. Of course, if there is any other source of iron\nfluorescence (e.g., from reflection by very Compton-thick matter),\nthese covering fractions must be considered upper limits.\nThe detailed absorption-dominated model discussed by MTR\nis rather more sophisticated than our \"extreme\" case in the sense\nthat the hard X-ray bump is modeled by an ionized reflector (that\ndoes not display any relativistic effects and hence is inferred to be\nat large distance from the black hole) which is absorbed by a photoionized absorber with NH \u223c 5 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 . By construction, the\niron line from the absorbed reflection spectrum describes the narrow weak 6.4 keV line seen in the Chandra/HETG spectrum. Using\nthe best-fitting parameters listed in MTR, we have confirmed that\nthe absorber removes the same number of 7.08 keV\u201320 keV photons from the observed spectrum as calculated above for our extreme case, to within a 10% accuracy. Since the fluorescence yield\nof iron increases with ionization state, the expected fluorescence\n(of intermediate charge states) should be even more prominent than\ndescribed above, leading to even more restrictive constraints on the\ncovering fraction of the absorber. In principle, resonant Auger destruction (e.g., Band et al. 1990; Ross et al. 1996) within both the\nphotoionized reflector and the absorber may reduce the iron line\nstrength somewhat, but significant reduction (more than a factor\nof two) requires a fine-tuning of the ionization parameters and the\nvelocity structure.\nThe constraint discussed here is also robust to uncertainties in\nthe iron abundance of the absorber since we are essentially comparing the iron edge to the iron line. Repeating the exercise above\n(with our extreme model) using an absorber with an iron abundance\nof 3Z\u2299 and 0.3Z\u2299 (all other abundances cosmic) yields predicted\niron line strengths that are within 10% of the cosmic abundance\ncase.\nNote that the covering fraction constraints deduced here become stronger upper limits if it is assumed that the Compton thick\nabsorber is in the form of clumps in a wind which is itself absorbing\nand giving rise to fluorescent emission.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\nDespite the fact that it is not included in the commonly employed\nspectral models, it is an elementary fact that fluorescent emission accompanies photoelectric absorption. As we have seen, exploiting this connection provides a powerful new constraint on the\nabsorption-dominated model for MCG\u20136-30-15. In particular, the\nmarginally Compton-thick absorber responsible for the hard X-ray\nhump at 20 keV cannot subtend more than 2\u20134 per cent of the sky\nas seen from the X-ray source or else it will overproduce the fluorescent iron line.\nThus, the absorption-dominated model requires a puzzling\ngeometry. The rapid fluctuations of the continuum source on\ntimescales as short as \u223c 100 s (Reynolds 2000; Vaughan, Fabian &\nNandra 2003) suggest an X-ray source with an extent of only \u223c 2rg\n(where we are assuming a central black hole mass of 1 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 ).\nHowever, in the MTR model, all of the absorbing structures are at\n100rg or further. If these structures are to only partially-obscure\nthe central compact X-ray source, either the observer must be in a\nspecial location so that the line of sight to the absorber skims the\nedge of the absorbing structure, or the absorber must be a \"mist\" of\nsmall clouds significantly smaller than the size of the X-ray source\n(in which case there is a confinement problem). So, within the con-\n\ntext of the MTR model, the most reasonable assumption is to place\nan additional continuum source at a larger distance, comparable to\nthat of the absorbing structure.\nBut the results of this paper provide a further constraint; that\nthe marginally Compton-thick absorber responsible for the hard Xray hump can subtend no more than 2\u20134% of the sky as seen by\nthe X-ray continuum source. If the absorber is approximately cospatial with the continuum source (as would be most natural given\nthe partial-covering constraint) it is very difficult to envisage a geometry in which this holds true. The geometric challenge is even\ngreater if one wishes to hypothesize that a large fraction of AGN\nhave similar absorption-dominated models (MTR; Sim et al. 2008).\nBy contrast, the relativistic-reflection model does not require\nunusual geometries or previously unrecognized structures within\nthe central engine. The difference spectrum (i.e., the difference between the spectrum when the source is bright to when it is faint) is\nwell described by a power-law modified by only the well-studied\nwarm absorption components required by grating spectra; neither\nthe broad iron line nor the reflection hump show up in the difference spectrum (Fabian et al. 2002; Miniutti et al. 2007). The\nabsorption-dominated model can accommodate this spectral variability, but only via unexplained correlations between the covering\nfraction of the absorbers and the continuum luminosity. By contrast, strong gravitational light-bending is a required and inevitable\nphysical process within the relativistic-reflection model and naturally explains the lack of response of the reflection features to\nthe continuum variability (Reynolds & Begelman 1997; Matt et al.\n2000; Miniutti et al. 2003; Miniutti & Fabian 2004). Hand in hand\nwith the variability, the gravitational light-bending of continuum\nX-rays towards the disk explains the fact that the strength of the\nreflection hump is 2\u20133 times that expected from isotropic illumination of a planar disk. A prediction of the light-bending model is\nthat the broad iron line strength is correlated with the continuum\nluminosity in low flux states; this was confirmed by XMM-Newton\nspectroscopy of the June-2000 deep minimum state (Reynolds et\nal. 2004).\nNote that blurring a strong line produced by absorption, in\nsay a wind, by Compton downscattering also means that the high\nenergy continuum is also downscattered, to an unacceptable extent\n(Fabian et al 1995).\n\n5 SUMMARY\nThe relativistic-reflection model makes a bold claim, i.e., that we\nare seeing measurable and quantifiable effects from matter within\na few gravitational radii of the black hole. This gives us an astrophysical tool of enormous power for probing black hole physics.\nThus, it is important to carefully assess alternative models such as\nthe absorption-dominated model of MTR.\nSuzaku observations of the prototypical broad iron line AGN\nMCG\u20136-30-15 clearly reveal a strong, hard X-ray hump (in the\n10\u201330 keV band) which must be due to either X-ray reflection or\nabsorption by a marginally Compton-thick absorber. In either of\nthese cases, the low-energy side of the hump is shaped by the Kshell photoelectric absorption of iron. We consider the iron fluorescence associated with the hard X-ray hump and come to the following important conclusion; the only way to make the presence of\nthe hard X-ray hump compatible with the extremely weak narrow\niron line is to either strongly blur much of the iron line (as in the\nrelativistic-reflection model) or postulate a very special geometry\nfor the system. This conclusion is robust to mild ionization of the\n\n\fConstraints on the absorption-dominated model for the X-ray spectrum of MCG\u20136-30-15\nabsorber as postulated in the MTR model (since the fluorescence\nyield of iron and hence the predicted strength of the line increases\nwith ionization state). Furthermore, since our argument amounts to\ncomparing the depth of the iron K-shall edge with the iron line, it\nis robust to uncertainties in the iron abundance. In the absence of a\nspecific geometry for the absorption-dominated model which satisfies the constraints discussed here, the relativistic-reflection model\nis favoured.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nCSR thanks the National Science Foundation for support under\ngrant AST06-07428.
