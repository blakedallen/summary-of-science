They arise after a symmetry of the\ngauge fixed action is found in the sector involving the Lagrange multiplier\nand its canonical momentum.\n\nEvery now and then new nilpotent symmetries are found for gauge theories. Their\ntransformation laws can be nonlocal and even not manifestly covariant. In all cases it was\npossible to show that they are different forms of the well known BRST symmetry [1]. Usually,\nthe claimed new transformations are found in the Lagrangian formulation of the theory and\nit is quite difficult to see its relation to the known form of the BRST transformations. Going\nto the Hamiltonian formulation and using the BRST-BFV formalism [2], the origin of these\ndifferent forms for the BRST transformations can be fully understood. In [1] it was also\nshown that there are symmetries of the gauge fixed action involving only the ghost sector\nwhich gives rise to these uncommon forms of the BRST transformations. In this letter we\nwill show that the sector consisting of the Lagrange multiplier and its momentum also has\nsymmetries which give rise to new forms for the BRST transformations.\nConsider a gauge theory in the Hamiltonian formulation. After all first class constraints\nhave been found we end up with a set of canonical variables (qi , pi ) and a canonical Hamiltonian H. The first class constraints Ga (p, q) obey the Poisson bracket algebra {Ga , H} = 0,\n{Ga , Gb } = f abc Gc , where all structure functions f abc are regarded as independent of the\ncanonical variables for simplicity. To each first class constraint we associate a Lagrange\nmultiplier \u03bba and its canonical momentum \u03a0a . We also introduce two sets of ghosts (ca , ca )\na\na\nand their corresponding canonical momenta (P , P a ) satisfying {P , cb } = {P a , cb } = \u2212\u03b4 ab .\nThen, the BRST charge can be built as\nZ\n1\na\nQ = dx (Ga ca + f abc P cb cc \u2212 P a \u03a0a ),\n(1)\n2\nwhere the integration is performed over the space\ntransformations are\n1\n\u03b4ca = \u2212 f abc cb cc ,\n2\na\nb\n\u03b4P = \u2212Ga \u2212 f abc P cc ,\n\u03b4\u03bba = P a ,\n1\n\ncoordinates. The Hamiltonian BRST\n\u03b4ca = \u03a0a ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b4P a = 0,\n\u03b4\u03a0a = 0,\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n\fand the BRST invariant action is\nZ\na\nS = dx (pi q\u0307i + \u1e56 a ca + \u010ba P + \u03a0a \u03bb\u0307a \u2212 H \u2212 {Q, \u03a8}),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere a dot means time derivative and \u03a8 is the gauge fixing Rfunction. The main assertion\nin the BRST-BFV formalism is that the path integral Z = D[\u03c6] exp(iS), where D[\u03c6] is\nthe usual Liouville measure over all fields and ghosts, is independent of the gauge fixing\nfunction \u03a8.\nUsually the gauge fixing function is chosen as\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nZ\n1 a\na a\na\na\n\u03a8 = dx c\n\u03be\u03a0 + f (q) + P \u03bb ,\n(6)\n2\nwhere f a is a function of qi only and \u03be is a gauge fixing parameter. This choice of \u03a8\nimplements the gauge choice f a + \u03bb\u0307a which leads to many well known gauges like linear\ngauge conditions in Yang-Mills theory.\nLet us now perform the functional integration over the ghost momenta. Integration over\na\nP results in a delta functional \u03b4(P a \u2212 D0 ca ), where D0 ca = \u010ba + f abc \u03bbb cc . Integration over\nP a then sets P a = D0 ca . The resulting action is\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\nZ\n1 a\na\na\na\na\na\na\na a\na\nS = dx pi q\u0307i \u2212 H + \u010b D0 c + c \u03b4f + \u03bb G \u2212 \u03a0\n,\n(7)\n\u03be\u03a0 + f \u2212 \u03bb\u0307\n2\nwhich is invariant under the BRST transformations\n1\n\u03b4ca = \u2212 f abc cb cc ,\n2\n\u03b4\u03bba = D0 ca ,\n\n\u03b4ca = \u03a0a ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b4\u03a0a = 0.\n\n(9)\n\nUsually the integration over pi can be done if we identify the Lagrange multiplier \u03bba with\nsome variable in the original Lagrangian formalism. For the Yang-Mills theory, for instance,\nthe Lagrange multiplier is just Aa0 while \u03a0a is the auxiliary field needed to have off-shell\nnilpotency. Performing the integration over pi , the first two terms of the action (7) together\nwith the term \u03bba Ga recompose the original Lagrangian and we are left with\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nZ\n1 a\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\nS = dx L(q, q\u0307) + \u010b D0 c + c \u03b4f \u2212 \u03a0\n.\n(10)\n\u03be\u03a0 + f \u2212 \u03bb\u0307\n2\nThis is the Lagrangian form of the gauge fixed action. It is invariant under the BRST\ntransformations (8) and (9).\nIn [1] we particularised to the Yang-Mills case and studied the symmetries of the gauge\nfixed action involving only the ghost terms in (10). We showed that in the new variables\nthe BRST transformations are nonlocal or even not manifestly covariant. Here we want to\nfocus in the sector (\u03bba , \u03a0a ). It is easily seen that the most general transformation leaving\nthis sector of the action invariant is\n2\n\u03a0\u2032a = \u2212\u03a0a \u2212 (f a \u2212 \u03bb\u0307a ),\n\u03be\n2\n\n\u03bb\u2032a = \u03bba .\n\n(11)\n\n\fNotice that this transformation has Jacobian equal to minus one so it does not affect the\npath integral measure. The action (10) retains its form but the BRST transformation for\nthe new variable is now\n2\n\u03b4\u03a0\u2032a = \u2212 (\u03b4f a \u2212 \u22020 D0 ca ) .\n\u03be\n\n(12)\n\nThe BRST transformation for ca must also be expressed in terms of \u03a0\u2032a . Doing that and\ndropping the prime in \u03a0\u2032a we have a new set of BRST transformations which leave the action\n(10) invariant. It is given by\n1\n\u03b4ca = \u2212 f abc cb cc ,\n2\n\u03b4\u03bba = D0 ca ,\n\n2\n\u03b4ca = \u2212\u03a0a \u2212 (f a \u2212 \u03bb\u0307a ),\n\u03be\n2\n\u03b4\u03a0a = \u2212 (\u03b4f a \u2212 \u22020 D0 ca ) .\n\u03be\n\n(13)\n(14)\n\nThese BRST transformations have also been found in [3] 1 . We can understand the origin of\nthese transformations as new forms of the BRST symmetry. They are nilpotent and on-shell\nthey reduce properly to its previous form (8) and (9). Either form of the transformations is\nnilpotent showing that they realize the same BRST symmetry.\nIt is worth remarking that other symmetries, besides BRST symmetry, can be found for\ngauge fixed actions. The best known example is the vector supersymmetry which appears\nin the non-Abelian Chern-Simons theory in Landau gauge [4] which can be enlarged to\na contraction of the D(2|1; \u03b1) superalgebra [5]. This symmetry gives rise to new Ward\nidentities which were used in [4] to relate the gauge and ghost propagators. In the present\ncase, the new form of the BRST transformations can be used in conjunction which its usual\nform. This may be useful from a technical point of view but the physical content is the\nsame as those found with the usual BRST transformations since there is only one symmetry\npresent.\nAlthough we have worked with an irreducible gauge theory and with bosonic constraints,\nthe formalism presented here can be easily generalized to the reducible case and to systems\nwith bosonic and fermionic constraints.\nThis work was partially supported by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u0131\u0301fico\ne Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq) and PRONEX under contract CNPq 66.2002/1998-99.\n\ncomparison note that its gauge fixing condition f A corresponds to f a \u2212 \u03bb\u0307a in this paper,\nwhile the auxiliary field hA corresponds to \u03a0a and the ghost \u03c9 A is proportional ca . Our change of\nvariables (11) is the same transformation proposed there.\n1 For\n\n3\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] V. O.
