In 1998, Winfree [7] introduced the (abstract) Tile Assembly\nModel (TAM) \u2013 an \"effectivization\" of Wang tiling [5, 6] \u2013 as an over-simplified mathematical model\nof the DNA self-assembly pioneered by Seeman [4]. In the TAM, the fundamental components are unrotatable, but translatable square \"tile types\" whose sides are labeled with glue \"colors\" and \"strengths.\"\nTwo tiles that are placed next to each other interact if the glue colors on their abutting sides match, and\nthey bind if the strength on their abutting sides matches with total strength at least a certain ambient\n\"temperature,\" usually taken to be 1 or 2.\nDespite its deliberate over-simplification, the TAM is a computationally and geometrically expressive\nmodel at temperature 2. The reason is that, at temperature 2, certain tiles are not permitted to bond until\ntwo tiles are already present to match the glues on the bonding sides, which enables cooperation between\ndifferent tile types to control the placement of new tiles. Winfree [7] proved that at temperature 2 the\nTAM is computationally universal and thus can be directed algorithmically.\nIn contrast, we aim to prove that the lack of cooperation at temperature 1 inhibits the sort of complex\nbehavior possible at temperature 2. Our main theorem concerns the weak self-assembly of subsets of\nZ2 using temperature 1 tile assembly systems. Informally, a set X \u2286 Z2 weakly self-assembles in a tile\nassembly system T if some of the tile types of T are painted black, and T is guaranteed to self-assemble\ninto an assembly \u03b1 of tiles such that X is precisely the set of integer lattice points at which \u03b1 contains\nblack tile types. As an example, Winfree [7] exhibited a temperature 2 tile assembly system, directed by a\nclever XOR-like algorithm, that weakly self-assembles a well-known set, the discrete Sierpinski triangle,\nonto the first quadrant. Note that the underlying shape (set of all points containing a tile, whether black\nor not) of Winfree's construction is an infinite canvas that covers the entire first quadrant, onto which a\nmore sophisticated set, the discrete Sierpinski triangle, is painted.\nWe show that under a plausible assumption, temperature 1 tile systems weakly self-assemble only a\nlimited class of sets. To prove our main result, we require the hypothesis that the tile system is pumpable.\nT. Neary, D. Woods, A.K. Seda and N.

We give a counterexample of a path in which the same tile type appears twice, yet\nthe segment between the appearances cannot be pumped without eventually resulting in a collision that\nprevents additional pumping. The hypothesis of pumpability states (roughly) that in every sufficiently\nlong path, despite the presence of some repeating tiles that cannot be pumped, there exists a segment in\nwhich the same tile type repeats that can be pumped. In the above-mentioned counterexample, the paths\nconstructed to create a blocked segment always contain some previous segment that is pumpable. We\nconjecture that this phenomenon, pumpability, occurs in every temperature 1 tile assembly system that\nproduces a unique infinite structure.\nA semi-doubly periodic set X \u2286 Z2 is a set of integer lattice points with the property that there\n~\nare\no point\" of the set), ~u, and ~v (the two periods of the set), such that X =\nn three vectors b (the \"base\n~b + n *~u + m *~v n, m \u2208 N . That is, a semi-doubly periodic set is a set that repeats infinitely along\ntwo vectors (linearly independent vectors in the non-degenerate case), starting at some base point ~b.\nWe show that any directed, pumpable, temperature 1 tile assembly system weakly self-assembles a set\nX \u2286 Z2 that is a finite union of semi-doubly periodic sets.\nIt is our contention that weak self-assembly captures the intuitive notion of what it means to \"compute\" with a tile assembly system. For example, the use of tile assembly systems to build shapes is\ncaptured by requiring all tile types to be black, in order to ask what set of integer lattice points contain\nany tile at all (so-called strict self-assembly). However, weak self-assembly is a more general notion.\nFor example, Winfree's above mentioned result shows that the discrete Sierpinski triangle weakly selfassembles at temperature 2 [3], yet this shape does not strictly self-assemble at any temperature [1].\nHence weak self-assembly allows for a more relaxed notion of set building, in which intermediate space\ncan be used for computation, without requiring that the space filled to carry out the computation also\nrepresent the final result of the computation.\nAs another example, there is a standard construction [7] by which a single-tape Turing machine\nmay be simulated by a temperature 2 tile assembly system. Regardless of the semantics of the Turing\nmachine (whether it decides a language, enumerates a language, computes a function, etc.), it is routine to represent the result of the computation by the weak self-assembly of some set. For example,\nPatitz and\n\b Summers2[2] showed\u0001 that for any decidable language A \u2286 N, A's projection along the X -axis\nthe set (x, 0) \u2208 N x \u2208 A\nweakly self-assembles in a temperature 2 tile assembly system. As another example, if a Turing machine computes a function f : N \u2192 N, it is routine to design a tile assembly\nsystem based on Winfree's construction such that, if the seed assembly is used to encode the binary\nrepresentation of a number n \u2208 N, then the tile assembly system weakly self-assembles the set\n(\n\n(k, 0) \u2208 N2\n\nthe kth least significant bit of the\nbinary representation of f (n) is 1\n\n)\n\n.\n\nOur result is motivated by the thesis that if a tile assembly system can reasonably be said to \"compute\", then the result of this computation can be represented in a straightforward manner as a set X \u2286 Z2\nthat weak self-assembles in the tile assembly system, or a closely related tile assembly system. Our examples above provide evidence for this thesis, although it is as informal and unprovable as the ChurchTuring thesis. On the basis of this claim, and the triviality of semi-doubly periodic sets, we conclude\n\n\fD. Doty, M. Patitz and S. Summers\n\n69\n\nthat our main result implies that directed, pumpable, temperature 1 tile assembly systems are incapable\nof general-purpose deterministic computation, without further relaxing the model.\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank Maria Axenovich, Matt Cook, and Jack Lutz for useful discussions, and anonymous\nreferees for corrections.
