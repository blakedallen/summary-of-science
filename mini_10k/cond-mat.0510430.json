To\nanswer the quest, the self-organization of matter[2] and\nthe emergence of order[3] have been regarded as the key\nideas. Kauffman first introduced the so-called Kauffman\nmodel \u2013 a random Boolean network (RBN) model, based\nupon the random network theory[4, 5, 6]. This model has\nbecome a prototype for many authors to study complex\nsystems such as metabolic stability and epigenesis, genetic regulatory networks, and transcriptional networks\n[3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]as well as general Boolean networks [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], neural networks[20] and\nspin glasses[21, 22, 23].\nIn the RBN, we assume that the total number of the\nelements (i.e., nodes) N and the link number of an element (i.e., the degree of a node) K in a directed random\nnetwork are kept to be constants, respectively. Kauffman found numerically that there is a phase transition\nfrom an ordered phase to a chaotic phase through the\ncritical point (i.e., edge of chaos) at K = Kc = 2 for\nthe equally probable model of the Boolean functions for\n0 and 1. Here in the chaotic phase the number of the\nstate cycle attractors grows as exponential in N ; in the\nordered phase the growth is proportional to N ; in the\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: kazumoto@stannet.ne.jp\naddress: f01j006g@mail.cc.niigata-u.ac.jp\n\u2021 Electronic address: hyamada@uranus.dti.ne.jp\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\u221a\ncritical point the growth is proportional to N . Later,\nthis phenomenon has been analytically verified by studying the \"annealed\" Kauffman models[14, 15, 16]. And\nalso exact results have been analytically obtained for the\nspecial cases of K = N [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] and K = 1\n[30, 31, 32].\nRecently there has appeared a revival interest on the\nstudy of the critical point of the Kauffman models with\nKc = 2 as well as Kc = 1/\u03c1 where \u03c1 = 2p(1\u2212p) and p denotes a probability (0 \u2264 p \u2264 1) given in the next section\n[33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. Here, the powerlaw distributions of the cycle length of attractor[33], the\nmodels with the finite numbers of 1 < K < 4[35, 36, 37],\nthe special cases of Kc = 2 networks such as the onedimensional network and the Cayley tree[38], the scaling\nnature of the critical (Kc = 2) point and the chaotic\n(K > 2) phase[39], the superpolynomial growth of the\nnumber of the state cycle attractors[40], the stability of\nthe system[41] have been studied both numerically and\nanalytically. These results suggest that the critical point\nof Kauffman model with Kc = 2 is very special.\nEspecially, Bastolla and Parisi[35, 36, 37] elucidated\nthat what is important on the critical line is the effective\nconnectivity Kef f (\u2248 1) and that the critical point of\nthe model exhibits the nature of percolation of information where the character shares much with that of K = 1\nstudied by Flyvbjerg and Kjaer[30]. To study this rather\npeculiar aspect further, Coppersmith et. al.[42, 43] studied numerically the \"reversible\" Kauffman model that\nis different from the original one in the sense that the\nformer is dissipative while the latter is non-dissipative.\nThey supplied a critical value of Kc \u223c\n= 1.62 for the non-\n\n\f2\ndissipative cases.\nOn the other hand, at nearly the end of 1990's the\nscale-free networks have been discovered from studying the growth of the internet geometry and topology\n[44, 45, 46, 50, 51]. After the discovery, scientists have\nbecome aware that many systems such as those which\nwere originally studied by Kauffman as well as other various systems such as internet topology, human sexual relationship, scientific collaboration, economical network,\nand so on. belong to the category of the scale-free networks [44, 45, 46, 50, 51]. Therefore, it is very natural\nto apply the concepts of scale-free networks to the Kauffman model and to ask whether or not there appears the\ndifference between the RBN and the scale-free random\nBoolean network (SFRBN).\nRecently, as to this direction, the dynamics of the\n\"quenched\" SFRBN has been intensively studied [52, 53,\n54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63]. It has been shown\nthat the critical point occurs when the average degree hki\nof the scale-free networks equals hkic = 2 for the equal\nprobability (i.e. no bias) models of p = 0.5, analytically\nstudying the \"annealed\" SFRBN [52, 58, 59, 60] that\nare the scale-free analogs of the \"annealed\" RBN studied by Derrida and Pomeau[14]. Analytical results have\nbeen obtained for the annealed model with N \u2192 \u221e under some assumptions such as mean field approximation\nand ergodicity. On the other hand, a lot of numerical results have been calculated for finite-size quenched model.\nIn the numerical simulation there are various ways for\nthe sampling over, for example, (A)different networks,\n(B)different initial states, and (C)different Boolean functions assigned for each node. In particular, the mean\nvalue over the numerical distribution becomes insignificance when the distribution is broad because the order\nof fluctuation exceeds over the mean value. Then the\nrelative fluctuation diverges for system size going to infinity, i.e. not self-averaging. Such a phenomena can be\nfound at second-order phase transition and scale-free networks with power-law correlation [57]. In the situation\nthe median value is statistically more robust against the\nartifacts due to undersampling of the set of the networks\nand the initial states than the mean value.\nIn this paper we would like to mainly investigate a\nqualitative transition in the function form of the median value m\u0304 over the distribution of attractor length as\na function of the finite N , changing the average degree\nhki. Note that the transition does not always mean phase\ntransition in the usual statistical mechanics sense, which\nis defined in the thermodynamic limit of N \u2192 \u221e. One of\nour interests is also finite-size effect of the transition phenomena around hki = 2 in the Boolean dynamics. How\nis the transition observed in the relatively small network\ncorresponding to the realistic network size?\nTo ease the reference, we first summarize our main result: There is a transition of the function form m\u0304 \u221d N \u03b1\nfrom \u03b1 < 1 to \u03b1 > 1 within a range of 1.4 < hkic < 1.7\nin the \"quenched\" SFRBN without bias. The transition becomes important when we consider some real-\n\nistic biological networks, as Kauffman first introduced,\nbecause the realistic data suggest that the number of\ncell types in organism is crudely proportional to the linear or square-root function of the DNA content per cell,\n\u221d N \u03b1 (\u03b1 \u2264 1). We adapted a completely synchronous\nupdating rule in the Boolean dynamics because the attractor lengths are well-defined only for the synchronous\nupdating rule. However, it is noting that the synchronism\nidealization is not always true for biological systems as\ngenetic regulatory networks and asynchronous updating\nrules are more plausible for biological phenomena[64].\nMoreover, the function form m\u0304(N ) asymptotically\nchanges from the algebraic type m\u0304(N ) \u221d N \u03b1 to the exponential one as the average degree hki goes to hki = 2.\nThis result is consistent with the previous belief that the\ntransition occurs at the critical value of the degree of\nnodes of Kc = 2 in the \"annealed\" RBN and SFRBN\ns[3].\nThe organization of the paper is the following. In\nSec.II, we present the Kauffman models that we study. In\nSec.III, to apply various networks to the Kauffman models we give how to generate such networks. In Sec.IV, we\nstudy the cycle distributions of the \"quenched\" Kauffman\nmodels for the various network systems. In Sec.V, conclusions will be made. We mainly focused on the change\nof the functional form of the median around the critical\nvalue hki \u2264 2 in the main text. However, the other quantities such as Derrida plots and frozen nodes density are\nalso used in order to investigate the Boolean dynamics.\nWe briefly give analytical result for hki = 1 in appendix\nA and Derrida plots in appendix B.\nII.\n\nRANDOM BOOLEAN NETWORK (RBN)\n\nThe RBN requires us to assume that the total number of nodes (vertices) N and the degree (the number\nof links) of the i-th node ki are fixed in the problem,\nwhere all ki = K. Since there are K inputs to each node,\nK\n22 Boolean functions can be defined on each node; the\nK\nnumber 22 certainly becomes very large as K becomes\na large number. Then, we assume that Boolean funcK\ntions are randomly chosen on each node from the 22\npossibilities. Locally this can be given by\n\u03c3i (t + 1) = Bi (\u03c3i1 (t), \u03c3i2 (t), * * * , \u03c3iki (t))\n\n(1)\n\nfor i = 1, . . . , N ,where \u03c3i \u2208 Z2 \u2261 {0, 1} is the binary\nstate and Bi \u2208 Z2 is a Boolean function at the ith node,\nki\nrandomly chosen from 22 Boolean functions, where the\nprobability to take 1 (or 0) is assumed to be p (or 1 \u2212 p)\n(TABLE 1). In this paper we used a case of p = 1/2\nfor the numerical calculations. But the treatment for\nother cases of p 6= 1/2 is straightforward[65]. If we\nfix the set of the randomly chosen Boolean functions\n{Bi , i = 1, * * * , N } in the course of time development,\nthen this model is called \"quenched\" model[7]. On\nthe other hand, if we change each time the set of the\n\n\f3\nrandomly chosen Boolean functions in the course of time\ndevelopment, then this model is called \"annealed\" model\n[14, 15, 16, 34].\n\u03c3i1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\n\u03c3i2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n..\n.\n\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n..\n.\n\n\u03c3iki\u22121\n0\n0\n1\n1\n..\n.\n\n\u03c3iki\n0\n1\n0\n1\n..\n.\n\nBi\n\u03c31\n\u03c32\n\u03c33\n\u03c34\n..\n.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n***\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c32ki\n\nIII.\n\nTABLE 1.\nThe relationship between the Boolean\nfunctions Bi and inputs, {\u03c3i1 , \u03c3i2 , * * * , \u03c3iki }.

Hence, there are possibly 22 Boolean functions\nat each node.\nWe then study the dynamics of the \"quenched\" RBN.\nSince there are N nodes in the random network, there\nare 2N states |\u03c8i = |\u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3N i in the system such\nas |\u03c80 i = |0, 0, 0, . . . , 0i, . . . , |\u03c82N \u22121 i = |1, 1, 1, . . . , 1i.\nThese states form all vertices of a hypercube in N dimensions. First, we start to define the initial state |\u03c8 (1) i out\nof the 2N states (for example, say |\u03c8 (1) i = |0, 1, 1, . . . , 0i).\nSecond, according to the Boolean functions defined on\nthe network, the initial state evolves to another state\n|\u03c8 (2) i in the 2N states. Hence, the time development can\nbe simply denoted as\n|\u03c8 (t+1) i = Bt |\u03c8 (t) i,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere each entry in |\u03c8 (t) i can be developed by Eq.(1) and\nBt means a Boolean function chosen at time t. Therefore,\nif we collect all the 2N states as a 2N -dimensional vector\n|\u03a8(t) i = (|0, 0, 0, . . . , 0i, . . . , |1, 1, 1, . . . , 1i)T , then we can\nget a matrix representation of Eq.(2) as\n|\u03a8\u0303(t+1) i = B\u0302t |\u03a8(t) i.\n\np\nwe obtain the critical value pc = (1 \u00b1 1 \u2212 2/K)/2. As\nis described in the introduction, the analytical methods\nfor the systems with special values of the degree of nodes\n[24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 40] have been studied in\ndetails, already.\n\n(3)\n\nHere B\u0302t is a 2N \u00d72N matrix that all components are only\n0 or 1, and |\u03a8\u0303(t+1) i means a state vector whose components are degenerate such that the mapping of Eq.(3) is\nnot a one-to-one but a many-to-one correspondence.\nConsidering this time developing equation, we find the\ncyclic structure of the states such as the length of the\nstate cycle, the transient time and the basin size, and\nso on[3, 7, 19]. It is obviously difficult to do this procedure by an analytical method in general. Therefore,\nwe must do it numerically[19] as well as analytically if\npossible. However, there are some important analytical\nresults. The analytical investigations on the \"annealed\"\nmodels [14, 15, 16, 34] showed the existence of a phase\ntransition at the critical value of Kc = 1/[2p(1 \u2212 p)]\n[14, 15, 16, 34], and if we solve it conversely for p then\n\nVARIOUS NETWORK MODELS\n\nTo apply the RBN to that with a given network,\nwe have to specify what kind of network model we\ntake. Since there are so many types of networks[46], we\nlimit ourselves only to consider the directed random networks that were first considered by Kauffman[3], the directed scale-free networks, and the directed exponentialfluctuation networks in this paper. But the generalization to other networks is straightforward. In this section,\nwe will give how to generate such directed networks except the directed random networks, since the generation\nof those is very well known [4, 5, 6, 46, 47].\nA.\n\nDirected scale-free networks with the integer\naverage degree of nodes\n\nLet us first consider the directed scale-free networks.\nIn this case, we adopt a little modified version of the socalled Barab\u00e1si-Albert model[45], since we have to treat\nthe directed scale-free networks with fractional numbers\nof the average degree of a node (i.e., vertex), hki, such as\n1 \u2264 hki \u2264 2.\nDenote by \u03bdi the i-th node to which we want to put\nlinks and denote by \u03bdj one of the surrounding nodes.\nThen, the input from the j-th node to the i-th node is\ndescribed by the in-going arrow as \u03bdi \u2190 \u03bdj , while the\noutput from the i-th node to the j-th node is described\nby the out-going arrow as \u03bdi \u2192 \u03bdj . Denote by kiin (\u2261\nkj\u2192i ) the input degree of the i-th node. Denote by kiout\n(\u2261 kj\u2190i ) the output degree of the i-th node. We note\nthat from simple consideration, when one input link to\nthe i-th node is put between the i-th node and the j-th\nnode, it becomes one output link for the j-th node at the\nsame time. Therefore, if one input link is increased, so is\none output link simultaneously.\nLet us consider the case that the average degree of\nnodes, hki, is an even integer, such as hki = 2n. (A1)\nWe initially start with m0 (\u2265 n) nodes for seeds of the\nsystem. We assume that both input and output links\nare simultaneously linked between all of the initial seed\nnodes. Therefore, the total link numbers for the input\nand the output are n(n \u2212 1)/2 \u2261 L0 , respectively. (A2)\nNext, every time when we add one node to the system,\nm = n (\u2264 m0 ) new links are randomly chosen in the\npreviously existing network, according to the preferential\nattachment probability for the output network,\nkiout\n\u03a0i (kiout ) = PN (t)\u22121\nj=1\n\nkjout\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\n\f4\n(A3) Similarly we redo the same procedure for the input\nnetwork, according to the preferential attachment probability for the input network,\nkiin\n\u03a0i (kiin ) = PN (t)\u22121\nj=1\n\nkjin\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nWe continue the above procedures until the system size\nN is achieved. Therefore, after t steps, we obtain the\ntotal number of nodes as N (t) = m0 + t and the total\nnumbers of links for the input Lin (t) and output Lout (t)\nas Lin (t) = Lout (t) = L0 + 2nt, respectively. Hence,\nby this we can obtain for the directed scale-free network\nhk in i \u2261 2Lin (t)/N (t) = 2n, hk out i \u2261 2Lout (t)/N (t) = 2n\nas t \u2192 \u221e.\nWhen hki = 2n + 1, after the procedure (A3) we add\none more procedure: (A4) we redo the procedure (A2) or\n(A3) with equal probability.\n\nB.\n\nDirected scale-free networks with the fractional\naverage degree of nodes\n\nLet us next consider the directed scale-free networks\nwith a fractional average number of degree. Suppose that\nhki is fractional such that hki = [hki] + (hki) where [hki]\nmeans the integer part (say, n) and (hki) the fractional\npart (say, f ) such that hki = n + f , where 0 < f < 1.\nIn this case, (B1) we first follow the same procedure\n(A1) in the previous subsection A. (B2) Second, we add\none node to the system at each step of time. Every time\nwhen a new node is added, we have to define the node to\ngive input or output. For this, we randomly choose input or output with equal probability of 0.5. (B3) Third,\nif the chosen case is input (output) for the node, then\nwe follow the procedure (A2) [(A3)] in the previous subsection A. Then, we place the input (output) links with\nequal probability 1 among the chosen links. (B4) Fourth,\nif the not-chosen case is output (input) for the node, then\nwe follow the procedure (A3) [(A2)] in the previous subsection A. Then, we place the output (input) links with\nequal probability f /n (0 < f < 1) among the chosen\nlinks. (B5) Fifth, go back to (B2) and redo the same\nprocedures until the system size N is achieved.\nThen, after t steps, we obtain the total number of\nnodes N (t) = n + t, the total number of input links\nLin (t) = L0 + (n + f )t, and the total number of output links Lout (t) = L0 + (n + f )t, respectively. Hence, we\ncan obtain the average input and output degrees of nodes\nhk in i \u2261 Lin (t)/N (t) = n+f and hk out i \u2261 Lout (t)/N (t) =\nn + f as t \u2192 \u221e, respectively.\nUsing the above method, we can construct a scale-free\nnetwork with a fractional average degree of nodes 1 <\nhki < 2. For example, consider the case of hki = 1.4. In\nthis case, we just take n = 1 and f = 0.4.\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Typical examples of directed networks are shown for the size of N = 64. (a),(b) Random\nnetwork with K = 2; (c),(d) Exponential-fluctuation network\nwith hki = 2; (e),(f) Scale-free network with hki = 2. We\nshow same network by two kinds of representation. For (a),\n(c) and (e) the nodes are located on the circumference with\nequal distance. For (b), (d) and (f) the nodes are randomly\ndistributed in the square. Each node is represented as a bold\npoint with size in proportion to the number of the input links.\nWe represent input(output)-side of the links with deep(faint)\ncolor such that the direction of a link is denoted by the color\ngradation from deep color(output) to faint color(input).\n\nC.\n\nDirected exponential-fluctuation networks\n\nLet us consider the directed exponential-fluctuation\nnetworks. We can follow the same procedure for both\nthe cases of the integer and fractional average degrees of\nnodes, replacing the probabilities of Eqs.(4) and (5) by\n\u03a0i (kiin ) = \u03a0i (kiout ) =\n\n1\n.\nm0 + t\n\n(6)\n\nThe exponential-like distributions are often observed in\nsome real-world networks [48]. The generalization to\nother networks can be straightforward[49].\nFig.1 shows typical examples of the directed networks\n\n\f5\nwhere the total number of nodes N = 64 is used: (a),(b)\nthe directed random network with the degree of nodes,\nK = 2; (c),(d) the directed scale-free network with the\naverage degree of nodes, hki = 2; and (e),(f) the directed\nexponential-fluctuation networks with the average degree\nof nodes, hki = 2, respectively.\n\nIV.\n\nCYCLE DISTRIBUTIONS\n\nNow we are going to apply the above-mentioned\n\"quenched\" Kauffman's Boolean dynamics to the directed random networks, the directed scale-free networks,\nand the directed exponential-fluctuation networks. The\nfirst one provides the famous \"quenched\" RBN, the second one the \"quenched\" SFBN model, and the third one\nthe \"quenched\" exponential-fluctuation random boolean\nnetwork(EFRBN) model[3].\nBefore going to present the numerical results, let us\nexplain the calculation method for obtaining the lengths\nof the state cycles as follows: (i) Realizations: We first\nprepare 1, 000 sample networks with the size of N and\ninvestigate them in order. (ii) Initial conditions: Second,\nwe randomly choose an initial state |\u03a8(0) i out of the 2N\nstates. (iii) The \"quenched\" Boolean dynamics: Third,\nwe calculate the \"Boolean dynamics\" [given by Eq.(2)]\nrepeatedly from 10 times to 100, 000 times, where we fix\na special set of the Boolean functions on the network.\nThis means that we treat the \"quenched\" model. (iv)\nState cycles: Fourth, we investigate whether there exist the states that belong to the equivalent state in the\ndata. Since the \"Boolean dynamics\" is deterministic, if\nthe state |\u03a8(t1 ) i at time t = t1 is the same as the state\n|\u03a8(t1 +s) i at t = t1 +s, then the state |\u03a8(t1 +1) i at t = t1 +1\nbecomes the same state as the state |\u03a8(t1 +s+1) i at time\nt = t1 + s + 1. Therefore, the length of the state cycles\nsatisfying this condition is s + 1. Such calculations are\nperformed for all network samples.\n\nA.\n\nHistograms of the lengths lc of the state cycles\n\nFig.2 shows the histograms of the lengths lc of the state\ncycles in the original \"quenched\" RBN with K = 2, 4 and\nin the \"quenched\" SFRBN and EFRBN where the average degree of nodes hki = 2, 4. We can see that the functional forms of the distributions seem exponential type.\nThe tail of the distribution depends on the fluctuation\nproperty of the degree of the nodes. We found that in\ncomparing among the three types of the network structures the maximum length of the state cycle becomes\nlonger as the fluctuation in the degrees of nodes becomes\nlarger. We try to investigate the more accurate functional\nform of the distribution and the transition depending on\nthe degree of nodes K and hki.\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Histograms h of the lengths lc of state\ncycles in various types of the directed networks. The network\nsize is N = 40. Each histogram is generated by 103 different sets of the Boolean functions and five different network\nstructures. The maximum iteration number of the Boolean\ndynamics is 105 until the convergence to the cycle is realized.\n(a)-(b) RBN with K = 2, 4; (c)-(d) EFRBN with hki = 2, 4;\nK\n(e)-(f) SFRBN with hki = 2, 4. Here in (a)-(b) 22 Boolean\nfunctions of K variables are used equiprobably, while in (c)-(f)\nki\n22 Boolean functions of ki variables are used equiprobably\nat the i-th node. The lines are the exponential fittings to the\nnumerical data. The mesh sizes of the histograms are 1 for\nK = 2 and hki = 2, 102 for K = 4 and hki = 4.\n\nB. The median m\u0304, the mean value hlc i, and the\nstandard deviation \u03c3 of the distributions of the state\ncycle lengths\n\nFig.3 shows the median m\u0304, the mean value hlc i, and\nthe standard deviation \u03c3 of the distributions of the state\ncycle lengths with respect to the total number N (\u223c 150)\nof nodes for the various directed networks, respectively.\nFig. 3(a) \u221a\nshows that in the RBN with K = 2 the median\ngrows as N in relatively small N region and it grows\nas proportional\n\u221a to N in the large N . Whether or not the\nbehavior of N is valid is very delicate since we have to\nalways stem this from the numerical data of the finite size\nsystems. The more details will be shown elsewhere[65].\nOn the other hand, in the RBN with K = 4 the median\ngrows exponentially with N as m\u0304 \u223c eaN . We have observed that as K increases, the growth type of the median\nexhibits a transition from algebraic type to exponential\none in the RBN. In the EFRBN and the SFRBN, the\nmedian grows exponentially with N for hki = 2 and 4,\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) The relationship between the mean\nvalue hlc i and the standard deviation \u03c3 of the distributions of\nthe state cycle lengths with respect to the total number N of\nnodes for the RBN with K = 2, 4 and the SFRBN hki = 2, 4,\nrespectively. The lines are fitting to the numerical data as\n\u03c3 \u223c hlc i\u03b2 . The best fitted exponents are \u03b2 = 1.61, 1.02 for\nthe RBN with K = 2, 4, and \u03b2 = 1.19, 1.02 for the SFRBN\nwith hki = 2, 4, respectively. The result for the EFRBN is\nalmost the same as that for the SFRBN.\n\nC.\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Semilog-plots of the the median m\u0304,\nthe mean value hlc i, and the standard deviation \u03c3 of 5000\nsamples of the state cycles with respect to the total number\nN of nodes for the various directed networks, respectively.\n(a)-(c) are shown for the RBN with K = 2, 4. (e)-(f) are\nshown for the EFRBN with hki = 1, 2, 4. And (g)-(i) are\nshown for the SFRBN with hki = 1, 2, 4. The lines are best\nexponential fittings, m\u0304 \u223c eaN , hlc i \u223c ebN , \u03c3 \u223c ecN , to the\nnumerical data except for the RBN with K = 2. The best\nfitted exponents are a = 0.02, b = 0.037, c = 0.044 for the\nEFRBN with hki = 2; a = 0.0168, b = 0.022, c = 0.025 for\nthe SFRBN with hki = 2; a = 0.163, b = 0.193, c = 0.194 for\nthe RBN with K = 4; a = 0.170, b = 0.179, c = 0.194 for the\nEFRBN with hki = 4; a = 0.123, b = 0.131, c = 0.136 for the\nSFRBN with hki = 4.\n\nand such a transition can not be observed in the range\nbetween hki = 2 and hki = 4. Therefore, we conjecture that based on Fig.3, the transition takes place in\nthe range between hki = 1 and hki = 2 in the RBN and\nthe EFRBN.Note that N dependence for hki = 1 can be\nanalytically derived. (See appendix A.)\nFurthermore, we can see the mean value hlc i and the\nstandard deviation \u03c3 grow exponentially with N such\nas hlc i \u223c ebN , \u03c3 \u223c ecN , in all cases. It is difficult to\ndistinguish clearly the dynamical properties between the\nSFRBN and the EFRBN when the network size N is as\nsmall as N \u223c 150.\n\nThe relationship between the mean value hlc i\nand the standard deviation \u03c3\n\nFig.4 shows the relationship between the mean value\nhlc i and the standard deviation \u03c3 of the distributions of\nthe lengths of the state cycles with respect to the total\nnumber N of nodes for the RBN and the SFRBN, respectively. We have found that the relationship is fitted by\nthe following expression: \u03c3 = hlc i\u03b2 . The best fitted exponent \u03b2 is nearly equal to unity for K = 4 and hki = 4.\nAs a matter of fact, we can guess that in the continuum\nlimit of the relatively large N , the distribution P (lc ) approaches the exponential form P (lc ) = \u03b1 exp(\u2212\u03b1lc ), as\nK and hki increases. In the exponential distribution, the\nmean value hlc i and the standard deviation \u03c3 can be\nrepresented in terms of the single parameter \u03b1 such as\nhlc i = \u03c3 = 1/\u03b1.\nD.\n\nPlots of the median value m\u0304\n\nAs shown in Fig.4 it is clear that the standard deviation \u03c3 is larger than the mean value hlc i for K = 2\nand hki = 2. In the cases, the numerical mean values are\nsometimes without credibility due to the lack of the samples with large cycle lengths. Such an imperfection of the\nself-averaging is well-observed for the distributions with\na long-tail. Therefore, we investigate the relatively stable\nmedian as representative values to characterize the distributions of the attractor lengths, instead of the mean,\nfor the large networks.\nFig.5 shows the median value m\u0304 of the distribution of\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Plots of the median value m\u0304 of 1000\nsamples of the lengths of the state cycles with respect to the\ntotal number N of nodes for the directed scale-free networks\nwith hki =1.3,1.4,1.5,1.6 and 1.7. The results for N up to 1024\nare shown. We used a cut-off attractor cycle length lcut = 105\ndue to the numerical difficulty to detect the large cycle length.\nFor the 10-20 network samples, we did not detect the attractor\ncycle lengths. However, it seriously does not influence on the\nmedian of the distribution.\n\nstate cycle lengths with respect to the total number N\nof nodes for the relatively large SFRBN (N \u223c 103 ). We\nfound that there is a transition in a range of 1.4 < hkic <\n1.7, dividing the N \u03b1 (\u03b1 < 1) growth and N \u03b1 (\u03b1 > 1)\ngrowth in polynomial growth in the ordered phase. Note\nthat some biological data suggest slow growth as N \u03b1 (\u03b1 \u2264\n1) in the relatively small network size (N \u223c 103 ).\nIt is well-known that the scale-free topologies are ubiquitously in nature and the degree exponents lie in between 2 and 3. Furthermore, one of the important property in the scale-free topology is the existence of the\nhighly connected hub as seen in the yeast synthetic network and so on [66]. The realistic systems do not contain\nenough nodes to closely approximate the true transition,\ntherefore, the finite-size behavior is important. In fact\nsome biological realistic data suggest that the number of\ncell types in organism is crudely proportional to the linear or square-root function of the DNA content per cell,\ni.e. m\u0304 \u221d N \u03b1 (\u03b1 \u2264 1) [3], for the finite-size N \u223c 103 .\n\nFinally, we investigate a transition between the polynomial growth in the ordered phase and the exponential\none in the chaotic phase. Figure 6 shows the semi-log and\nlog-log plots of the data near hki2 \u223c 2 in Fig.5. It is suggested that the function form m\u0304(N ) has an polynomial\nform for hki < 2 and approaches the exponential form as\nhki \u2192 2 in the quenched SFRBN. The results are consistent with the critical value Kc = 2 given for annealed\nSFRBN in other reports [52, 58, 59, 60]. In this section\nwe focused on the scaling of attractor length near critical value hki \u2266 2. The other quantities are also useful\nmeasure for the transition of the Boolean dynamics. (See\nappendix B.)\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) (a)Semilog-plots and (b)log-log-plots\nof the median m\u0304 with respect to the total number of nodes\nfor some values hki near hki = 2 for the scale-free network\nin Fig.5. Apparently, the case with hki = 2 exponentially\nincreases with respect to N . The straight line in (a) shows\nthe exponential growth for a guide for eyes, and the straight\nlines in (b) show the polynomial growth (m\u0304 \u221d N \u03b1 ) with the\nslopes \u03b1 = 2.5, 1.8, 0.98 from top to bottom.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, we have studied the Boolean dynamics of\nthe \"quenched\" Kauffman model with directed scale-free\nnetworks(SFRBN), comparing with ones of the directed\nrandom networks(RBN) and the directed exponentialfluctuation networks(EFRBN). We have numerically calculated the distributions of the lengths of the cycles and\nits changes as the network size N and the average degree\nof the node increase. We have found that the median,\nthe mean value and the standard deviation grows exponentially with N in the EFRBN and the SFRBN with\nhki = 2, 4, where the function forms of the distributions\nare almost exponential.\n\u00bfFrom our results we conclude that a transition occurs\nnear hki \u223c 2 in the SFRBN. The result is consistent with\nthat in the \"annealed\" SFRBN.\nIn this paper we dealt with the directed graphs that\ncorrespond to the asymmetric adjacency matrices in the\nnetwork theory. However, the quite different distribu-\n\n\f8\ntions of the state cycle lengths are observed in the undirected random networks. Therefore, it is also interesting\nto study the properties of the distributions of the state\ncycle lengths in the undirected scale-free networks as well.\nThe details will be given elsewhere [65].\nWe have numerically investigated the finite-size networks (N \u223c 140 \u2212 1024). In fact, it is very difficult\nto study the indefinitely large size of systems. This\nseems the disadvantage of our approach of the finite\nsize systems. However, practically speaking, there are\na lot of scale-free-type biological networks with size N \u223c\nO(102 )\u2212O(103 ), such as the metabolic reaction networks\nof the bacterium E.coli and of the Yeast protein interaction networks, etc[47, 66]. Thus, we believe that our\nresults stemmed from the finite size systems might play\nan important role to study such real network systems in\nNature. As we mentioned in the introduction, the asynchronous updating rules are more plausible for biological\nphenomena. It is interesting to expand the investigation\nto the asynchronous version.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Dr. Jun Hidaka for collecting\nmany relevant papers on the Kauffman model and the\nrelated topics.

I.) would like to thank\nKazuko Iguchi for her continuous financial support and\nencouragement.\nAPPENDIX A: A CASE WITH hki = 1\n\nIn this appendix, we compare the numerical results in\nSFRBN with hki = 1 with analytically result in RBN\nwith K = 1.\nIn Fig.7, we show the finite-size effect of the mean\nvalue hlc i. The analytical result hlc i \u2243 1.44 in RBN\nwith K = 1 have been derived based on the probability\nfor distribution of information conserving loops by Flyvbjerg and Kjaer [30]. It is found that the numerical\nresults converge a value 1.44 as the system size increases\nin both SFRBN and exponential-fluctuation network.\nAs mentioned in Sect.IV, we constructed the distribution of the attracter length by different networks with\nhki = 1, i.e. case (A) in introduction.Then the states\nconverge into a point attractor with period unity, lc = 1,\nthrough the transient states in a lot of the network samples.We can partially see the result in the distribution\nin 2. Accordingly the median m\u0304 over the distribution is\nalways unity independent of syatem size N in our case.\nAPPENDIX B: DERRIDA PLOTS\n\nIn this appendix, we give the numerical results of Derrida plot in the SFRBN. The Derrida plot, analogous\n\nto the Lyapunov exponent in the continuous dynamics,\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Mean value hlc i of attractor lengths\nin RBN and SFRBN with hki = 1.

A curve above the main diagonal H(t + 1) = H(t) indicates a divergent trajectory\nand chaotic. The area below the diagonal H(t+1) = H(t)\nis called the ordered region, because the trajectories converge in the state space. A curve tangential to the main\ndiagonal H(t + 1) = H(t) indicates a critical dynamics.\nFigure 8 shows the Derrida plots corresponding to the\nSFRBN with hki = 1, 2, 4. It is apparent that the SFRBN\nwith large hki exhibits more chaotic behavior than that\nwith small hki. It is important to note that the SFRBN\nis more ordered than the RBN compared with the cases\nwith K = hki. The Derrida coefficient is defined by\nDc = log s, where s is the slope of the Derrida plot\n(curve) at the origin. If s = 1 then Dc = 0, giving\nthe critical evolution. The slope of the Derrida plot for\nthe SFRBN with hki = 1 is approximately unity. The result is consistent with the occurence of the transition at\nhki = 2 in the function form of m\u0304(N ) observed in Subsec.\nIV.D.\nThe other quantities such as, the density of frozen\nnodes and the robustness against perturbation, are also\nimportant indicators for the dynamical behavior in the\nRBN and the SFRBN.\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Derrida plots of the SFRBN with\nhki = 1, hki = 2 and hki = 4. The analytical curves for the\nRBN with K = 1, K = 2 and K = 4 are also overplotted.@A\nline H(t + 1) = H(t) is the dividing line between order and\nchaos. It is clear that K = 2 lies directly on this line, the\nsystem size is N = 1024 and the number of the initial states\nfor averaging is 2000.\n\n[1] J.
