For electromagnetic interactions that do not change the particle content, we describe them in terms of the elastic electromagnetic\nform factors, whose dependence on transfer momentum (Q2 ) provides information about hadronic structure at different scales. Many experimental studies of these nucleon form factors have been conducted. Recently, a Jefferson Lab\nexperiment using both a polarized target and longitudinally polarized beam (so called double-polarization) revealed\na non-trivial momentum dependence for the ratio GpE /GpM . This contradicted previous results using the Rosenbluth\nseparation method, which suggested \u03bcp GpE /GpM \u2248 1. The apparent contradiction highlights the possibility of a systematic correction associated with two-photon exchange, affecting the Rosenbluth separation method more significantly\nthan double-polarization. (For details and further references, see the recent review articles: Refs. [1\u20133].)\nMeasuring the form factors at higher Q2 will help us to understand hadrons and challenge models based on quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD). Future experimental facilities, such as the 12-GeV upgrade at Jefferson Lab, will provide\nprecision data at large values of Q2 . Experimentally, it is easier to study proton form factors at larger Q2 , but\nrather challenging to study the neutron sector due to its neutral net charge and the lack of a free-neutron target.\nCurrent data for the neutron GE form factor only reaches to \u2248 4 GeV2 transfer momentum. However, the 12-GeV\nupgrade at Jefferson Lab will provide precision form factors to around 10\u201318 GeV2 for both the proton and neutron.\nTheoretically, perturbative QCD should converge better at larger Q2 . However, it fails to describe recent BaBar results\nfor \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c0 0 over a wide range of transfer momenta 4 GeV2 < Q2 < 40 GeV2 [4, 5]. This leaves an opportunity for\nnonperturbative QCD approaches to extend their region of applicability to these high-Q2 regions. Lattice QCD is a\nperfect candidate for the job.\nStudies in the nonperturbative regime of QCD theory have been difficult without resorting to model-dependent\ncalculations or making approximations due to the strong coupling at long distances. However, by discretizing spacetime into a four-dimensional lattice with a fixed lattice spacing and volume, we are able to compute the path integral\n(in terms of discretized versions of the QCD Lagrangian and operators) directly via numerical integration, providing\nfirst-principles calculations of the consequences of QCD. The techniques of lattice QCD have been applied to such\nvaried phenomena as the spectroscopy of heavy-quark hadrons, the tower of excited baryon states, flavor physics\ninvolving the CKM matrix, hadron decay constants and baryon axial couplings. Using lattice QCD to study hadronic\nform factors will serve as valuable theoretical input for understanding hadronic structure within the QCD theory of\nthe Standard Model.\nThe nucleon form factors have been calculated on the lattice by many groups, and calculations are still ongoing[6\u201319].\nRecently, lattice calculations have also been used to calculate transition form factors involving excited nucleons[20].\n\n\f2\nHowever, the typical Q2 range in lattice calculations of hadron form factors is less than 2.5 GeV2 . When one attempts\nhigher-Q2 calculations, they suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio; for example, see the case study for the pion in\nRef. [21].\nIn this work, we start to explore the possibility of reaching higher transfer momenta using lattice QCD by reexamining the conventional approach. To calculate the form factors, we need to calculate the three-point Green\nfunction, which requires an additional inversion of the fermion matrix over the whole lattice (with rank 12 \u00d7 L3 \u00d7 T ).\nSince traditionally this type of operation is resource intensive, especially for light quark masses, the parameters\nare carefully tuned to maximize overlap with the ground-state nucleon on a specific gauge ensemble, and the same\nparameters are used throughout the whole calculation. This simplifies the three-point correlator analysis, since one\nonly needs to consider one state in a given plateau region. However, when one increases the momentum of the nucleon\nstate, the original fixed parameters are no longer optimal; thus, the signal dies out quickly after adding only a few\nunits of discrete momentum on the lattice. We propose to keep multiple operators in the calculation with parameters\ntuned for both ground and excited states, but we also extend our analysis to account for these additional states. As\na result, we can extract the best signals at each transfer momentum. Since our analysis explicitly treats multiple\nexcited states, the ground state is safe from contamination. Further steps and details are addressed in Sec. II. We have\npreviously demonstrated the idea in an exploratory quenched lattice calculation[22] and extended it to a dynamical\nensemble[23]. In this work, we use multiple quark masses and improved statistics, giving a complete analysis for three\npion-mass ensembles of both quenched and dynamical (Nf = 2 + 1) configurations generated by the Hadron Spectrum\nCollaboration (HSC)[24, 25]. Note that even in this study, we may suffer large systematic error due to the coarseness\nof the lattices (as \u2248 0.100 and 0.123 fm, respectively). As finer lattices are generated by various lattice groups, one\ncan apply the same approach to reach even higher Q2 and significantly reduce systematic discretization errors.\nSince the elastic form factors contain information about the spatial structure of the nucleon, we can convert our\ndata into a description of its charge and magnetization densities. Due to the relativistic effects of the transferred\nmomentum on the wavefunction of the nucleon, we cannot use a simple three-dimensional Fourier transformation\nwithout some recourse to models. Instead, we use the model-independent formulation of Ref. [26] in terms of densities\nin a two-dimensional plane transverse to an infinite-momentum boost.\nIn this work, we concentrate on the electromagnetic properties of nucleons. The structure of this paper is as follows:\nIn Sec. II, we provide details concerning the configurations for both quenched and dynamical lattices. The operators\nand two- and three-point analysis procedure are given, as well as various checks of the method. We detail how we\nextract the electromagnetic form factors from lattice calculations. In Sec. III, we discuss the momentum dependence\nof the form factors. We also extract the electric-charge radii, magnetic radii and magnetic moments for the nucleon\nand compare with other Nf = 2 + 1 calculations. We extrapolate the form factors to the physical pion mass and\ncompare the quenched results to dynamical. We use our results to describe the spatial dependence of these quantities\nin a model-independent way as transverse charge and magnetization densities. Our conclusions and ideas for future\nimprovements to the calculation are presented in Sec. IV.\nII.\n\nMETHODOLOGY AND SETUP\n\nIn this work, we report on a calculation of nucleon form factors using anisotropic lattices, including both dynamical\nNf = 2 + 1 and quenched Nf = 0.\nThe 2+1-flavor anisotropic lattices used in this calculation were generated by the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration\n(HSC)[24, 25]. These lattices use Symanzik-improved gauge action with tree-level tadpole-improved coefficients,\nyielding a leading discretization error at O(a4s , a2t , g 2 a2s ). In the fermion sector, they have anisotropic clover action[27];\nthe gauge links in the fermion action are 3-dimensionally stout-link smeared with smearing weight \u03c1 = 0.14 and\nn\u03c1 = 2 iterations. The renormalized gauge and fermion anisotropies are around \u03be = 3.5 (that is, as = 3.5at ), and\nthe inverse of the spatial lattice spacing is about 1.6 GeV. For more details concerning the lattices and their action\nparameters, please see Ref. [24]. From the HSC ensembles, we use the 163 \u00d7 128 lattices with pion masses of 875,\n580 and 450 MeV. Quark propagators on the lattices are evaluated for source and sink operators with five Gaussian\nsmearing parameters: \u03c3 \u2208 {0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5}. Six, four and two time sources (respectively, from light to heavy\npion mass) are used, and a total of around 200 configurations are used from each ensemble. The quark propagators\nare calculated under antiperiodic boundary conditions in the time direction, while the spatial ones remain periodic.\nWe construct hadronic two-point correlators from all possible source-sink smearing combinations; however, for threepoint correlators, we reduce the computational burden by keeping only the diagonal source-sink smearing-operator\ncombinations.\nWe also use quenched 163 \u00d7 64 lattices with anisotropy \u03be = 3, using Wilson gauge action with \u03b2 = 6.1 and\nstout-link smeared[28] Sheikholeslami-Wohlert (SW) fermions[29] with smearing parameters {\u03c1, n\u03c1 } = {0.22, 2}. The\nparameter \u03bd is nonperturbatively tuned using the meson dispersion relation, and the clover coefficients are set to\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: Nucleon effective-mass plots with (|~\np|2 = 0 and 5 in units of 2\u03c0\na\u22121 ) from the m\u03c0 = 450 MeV ensemble. The square,\nL\ndiamond and triangle points correspond to smeared-smeared correlators with \u03c3 = 0.5, 1.5 and 4.5 respectively.\n\ntheir tadpole-improved values. The inverse spatial lattice spacing is about 2 GeV, as determined by the staticquark potential, and the simulated pion masses are about 480, 720 and 1100 MeV. In total, we use 400, 200 and\n200 configurations respectively at each pion mass. On the quenched lattices, we use only three Gaussian smearing\nparameters: \u03c3 \u2208 {0.5, 2.5, 4.5}. For both two-point and three-point hadronic correlators, we calculate all 9 possible\nsource-sink smearing combinations.\nWe construct correlators with the quantum numbers of the nucleon using baryonic interpolating operators of the\nform\n\u03c7N (x) = \u01ebabc [q1aT (x)C\u03b35 q2b (x)]q1c (x),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere C is the charge conjugation matrix, and q1 and q2 are one of the quarks {u, d}. For example, in the case of the\nproton, we want q1 = u and q2 = d. Two-point correlators are derived from these interpolating fields as\nX\nN\n\u2020\nCAB (t, t0 , p\n~) =\nei~p*~x h\u0393\u03c7N\nA (x, t)\u03c7B (0, t0 ) i,\nx\n\n4\nand A and B index over the different smearing\nwhere ~p is the baryon momentum, the spin projection \u0393 = 1+\u03b3\n2\nparameters. Eq. 2 can be decomposed in terms of energy eigenstates:\n\n(2)\n\np) =\n\u0393AB (t; ~\n\nX En + mn\nn\n\n2En\n\nZn,A Zn,B e\u2212En (~p)t ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere n indexes over the basis of nucleon energy eigenstates. (These states are defined to be normalized as\nh0|(\u03c7N )\u2020 |p, si = ZuN (~\np, s) with nucleon spin-1/2 interpolating field \u03c7N ); the spinors in Euclidean space satisfy\nX\ns\n\nuN (~\np, s)\u016bN (~\np, s) =\n\nE(~\np)\u03b3 t \u2212 i~\u03b3 * p~ + m\n.\n2E(~\np)\n\n(3)\n\nConventionally, one would choose a smearing parameter that optimizes the signal of the zero-momentum groundstate two-point correlators and carry out the form-factor calculation at various transfer momenta. We present an\nexample from the dynamical 450-MeV ensembles. The left-hand side of Fig. 1 shows the effective mass plot of the zeromomentum two-point nucleon correlator with all diagonal (with A = B) Gaussian smearing parameters. Examining\nthe behavior of these correlators, one usually chooses the smearing parameter that contains the least excited-state\nsignal, since this makes the analysis of the ground state simpler. In this example, the correlator with Gaussian\nsmearing parameter of \u03c3 = 4.5 is a good candidate: the excited-state signals die out around t = 10, giving enough\ndata points to extract ground-state form factors from t \u2208 [10, 30], if we put the sink around t = 40 (\u2248 1 fm source-sink\n\u22121\nseparation). If we increase the magnitude of the momentum, say to |~\np|2 = 5 in units of 2\u03c0\n, we can see the signal\nL a\nfrom the \u03c3 = 4.5 correlator decays significantly. This is not surprising, since this smearing parameter was chosen to\n\"filter out\" higher-energy contributions. So when increasing the momenta, the signal for the ground state starts to\ndisappear from broadly smeared sources, while it remains clear for smaller values of \u03c3. To improve the quality of the\nsignal at higher momenta, we should use multiple \u03c3 and explicitly subtract any excited-state contributions (ideally\nmore than one) to make sure that the ground state will be free from them.\nTo extract form factors from three-point correlators, we need En and Zn as inputs from analyzing two-point\ncorrelators. Here, we apply the variational method[30] to extract the principal correlators corresponding to pure\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 2: Summary of nucleon masses used by all currently existing Nf = 2 + 1 nucleon electromagnetic form-factor calculations [15\u201318]\n\nenergy eigenstates from our matrix of correlators. The N \u00d7 N Gaussian smeared-smeared correlation matrix (with\nN = 5 for dynamical and 3 for quenched) can be approximated as\nN\nX\n\nvin\u2217 vjn e\u2212tEn\n\n(4)\n\n\u03bbn (t, tr ) = e\u2212(t\u2212tr )En\n\n(5)\n\nC(t)V = \u03bb(t, tr )C(tr )V.\n\n(6)\n\nCij =\n\nn=1\n\nwith eigenvalues\n\nby solving the generalized eigensystem problem\n\nwhere V is the matrix of eigenvectors and tr is a reference time slice. The resulting 5 eigenvalues (principal correlators)\n\u03bbn (t, tr ) are then further analyzed to extract the energy levels En . In practice, we are only interested in the lowest\ntwo; the extra higher states provide buffers against contamination by higher excited states due to the lack of the\northogonality in our operators. Since they have been projected onto pure eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, the principal\ncorrelator should be fit well by a single exponential and double checked for the consistency of the obtained energies.\nThe leading contamination due to higher-lying states is another exponential having higher energy; we use a two-state\nfit to help remove this contamination. The overlap factors (Zn ) between the interpolating operators and the nth state\nare derived from the eigenvectors obtained in the variational method. Since we diagonalize the correlator matrix\nindependently on every time slice, Zn is a function of time; even though the time-dependence is mild, we choose the\nbest value of Zn by minimizing the difference between the correlator matrix reconstructed from Z and E and the\noriginal two-point correlator data.\nThe nucleon masses from the dynamical ensembles used in this work are summarized in Fig. 2; also shown are other\nNf = 2 + 1 nucleon masses used in published nucleon form-factor calculations. Figure 2 summarizes the pion and\nnucleon masses used by various groups who have calculated nucleon isovector Dirac and Pauli radii using Nf = 2 + 1.\n\"AnisoClover\" uses anisotropic lattice with clover actions; the pion masses ranges from 450\u2013850 MeV with spatial\nlattice spacing and size around 0.123 and 2 fm. \"RBC/DWF\" carried out calculations using domain-wall fermions\n(DWF) on ensembles with pion masses of 330\u2013670 MeV, spatial lattice spacing 0.114 fm and box size 2.7 fm[17].\n\"LHPC/DWF\" also used DWF ensembles with the same spatial volume but at a smaller lattice spacing (0.084 fm)\nthan \"RBC/DWF\", focusing on the pion-mass region 300\u2013400 MeV[16]. \"LHPC/Mixed\" used a staggered-fermion\nsea, DWF valence with pion masses 290\u2013760 MeV and a = 0.124 fm, L = 2.5 fm; they include one additional point\nwith lattice size 3.5 fm for a 350-MeV pion[15]. In this work, we emphasize calculation of larger-Q2 quantities,\nnecessitating the use of rather heavy quark mass inputs. In future calculations, we plan to have lighter quark masses\nand larger volumes. We can see from the plots that our nucleon masses fall nicely onto the trend outlined by other\nNf = 2 + 1 ensembles. Due to the higher quark masses used in this calculation, we do not find noticeable finite-volume\neffects despite our small \u2248 2 fm box size.\nTo calculate the nucleon electromagnetic form factors, we first calculate the matrix element h\u03c7N (~\npf )|V \u03bc |\u03c7N (~\npi )i,\n\u03bc\nwhere V = q\u03b3\u03bc q is the vector current with q being either an up or down quark, and p~{i,f } are the initial and final\n\n\f5\nnucleon momenta. We integrate out the spatial dependence and project the baryonic spin, leaving a time-dependent\nthree-point correlator of the form\nXX\n(3),T\n\u0393\u03bc,AB (ti , t, tf , p~i , p~f ) = ZV\nfn,n\u2032 (pf , pi , En\u2032 , En , t, ti , tf )\nn\n\n\u00d7\n\nX\n\nn\u2032\n\npf , s\u2032 ) |V\u03bc | Nn (~\npi , s)iun (~\npf , s\u2032 )\u03b2 hNn\u2032 (~\nT\u03b1\u03b2 un\u2032 (~\npi , s)\u03b1 ,\n\n(7)\n\ns,s\u2032\n\nwhere fn,n\u2032 (pf , pi , En\u2032 , En , t, ti , tf ) contains kinematic factors involving the energy En and overlap factors (Zn ) obtained\nin the two-point variational method, n and n\u2032 are the indices of different energy states and ZV is the vector-current\nrenormalization constant (which is set to its nonperturbative value). The projection T used on the quenched lattices\nis Tmix = 14 (1 + \u03b34 )(1 + i\u03b35\u03b33 ), and the dynamical lattices use T4 = 14 (1 + \u03b34 ) and T53 = 14 (1 + \u03b34)(i\u03b35 \u03b33 ). The sourcesink separation (tf \u2212 ti ) is 34 and 39 time slices in lattice units on the quenched and dynamical lattices respectively.\n\u22121\n(These give source-sink separations about 1.13 and 1.36 fm.) We use four final momenta (p~f = 2\u03c0\nL {0, 0, 0}a ,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u22121 2\u03c0\n\u22121 2\u03c0\n\u22121\n~i = L {nx , ny , nz }a\u22121\nL {\u22121, 0, 0}a , L {\u22121, \u22121, 0}a , L {\u22122, 0, 0}a ) and vary the initial momentum over all p\n2\n2\n2\nwith integer nx,y,z and nx + ny + nz \u2264 10. By fitting the time dependence of the three-point correlators to the form of\nEq. 7 with n and n\u2032 restricted to 0 and 1, we extract the ground state and matrix elements involving the first excited\nstate. In this work, we only concentrate on the ground-state matrix element with n = n\u2032 = 0.\nWith smeared fermion actions, it has been seen on three-flavor anisotropic lattices with tree-level tadpole-improved\nfermion-action coefficients that the nonperturbative coefficient conditions are automatically satisfied[24, 32]. Similar\nbehavior has also been observed in another quenched study[33], where the nonperturbative coefficients or renormalization constants in a smeared fermion action differed from tree-level values by a few percent. So the local vector\ncurrent used here is O(a) on-shell improved with the improved coefficient set to its tree-level value.\nThe form factors are then extracted from the vector-current matrix elements for any nucleon state N through\n\u0015\n\u0014\nF2 (q 2 )\n2\nhN V\u03bc N i\u03bc (~\nuN (~\npi ),\n(8)\nq ) = uN (p~f ) F1 (q )\u03b3\u03bc + \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd q\u03bd\n2mN\nwith q = pf \u2212 pi . By imposing the same projection matrix T , vector-current matrix elements, hN |V\u03bc | N i (with\nn = n\u2032 = 0) and momenta used in the lattice calculation in Eq. 7, we obtain a series of equations corresponding to\nthe various lattice correlators. The overdetermined system of linear equations allows solution for the Dirac and Pauli\nform factors F1,2 .\nTo make sure our analysis is correct, we check our procedures against the traditional one, the \"ratio\" method,\nwhere one takes ratios of three- and two-point correlators:\nv\nu (2),T\n(3),T\nZV \u0393\u03bc,GG (ti , t, tf ; ~pi , p~f ) u\nt \u0393P G (t, tf ; ~pi )\nRV\u03bc =\n(2),T\n(2),T\n\u0393GG (ti , tf ; p~f )\n\u0393P G (t, tf ; ~pf )\nv\nv\nu (2),T\nu (2),T\nu\u0393\nu\u0393\n(t\n,\nt;\np\n~\n)\ni\nf\nGG\nt\nt P G (ti , tf ; ~pf ) ,\n(9)\n\u00d7\n(2),T\n(2),T\n\u0393GG (ti , t; p~i ) \u0393P G (ti , tf ; ~pi )\n\nwith P and G corresponding to a point source and a Gaussian-smeared source. (We can also use another Gaussian\nsmearing to replace the point sources.) In this ratio, the exponential time dependence is canceled and one only needs\nto fit a constant. Note that this method only assumes that the region where one extracts the matrix elements contains\nonly ground-state signal. Otherwise, the matrix element will contain the contribution of unwanted excited-nucleon\nstates. Here we demonstrate the method using the data from the quenched calculation with 720-MeV pion mass,\np~f = {0, 0, 0}. We use the largest Gaussian smearing (\u03c3 = 4.5) three- and two-point data, which has good overlap\nwith ground state and not very much excited-state signal in the two-point effective-mass. Fig. 3 shows that both\nmethods have consistent d-quark contributions to the Dirac form factor at pion mass 720 MeV. The star points are\nobtained using the conventional ratio method, and the circular points are from our analysis combining 3 \u00d7 3 threepoint correlators. Note that we not only get consistent numbers for F1 , but at large momenta, our fitting approach\ndramatically improves the signal. This is because when one tries to improve the ground-state signal (normally done\nby examining the hadron effective-mass time dependence at zero momentum) with a choice of smearing operator, one\nwipes out not only the excited states but also the higher-momentum states. Therefore, when one tries to project\nonto these higher momenta, there is no doubt that the signal-to-noise ratio will worsen. Since we are explicitly\nconsidering excited states in our analysis, our sources which have good overlap with higher-momenta will be only\nlightly contaminated by excited-state signals.\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 3: Unrenormalized d-quark contribution to the nucleon Dirac form factor F1d obtained from the ratio approach (stars)\nand the method adopted by this work (circles) on a quenched ensemble with m\u03c0 = 720 MeV\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nIn this section, we compare the quenched and dynamical nucleon form factors at Q2 as large as 6 GeV2 and examine\ntheir dependence on the pion mass. We also consider the charge radii and magnetic moments; these quantities are\ncommonly derived from the electromagnetic form factors near or at Q2 = 0. Using calculations on ensembles at\ndifferent pion masses, we extrapolate the form factors and their ratios to the physical pion mass. Later in the section,\nwe study the large-momentum region and look at the charge distribution.\nIn Sec. II, we described how the Dirac (F1 ) and Pauli (F2 ) form factors are obtained from lattice calculations.\nAnother common set of form factor definitions, widely used in experiments, are the Sachs form factors; these can be\nrelated to the Dirac and Pauli form factors through\nGE (Q2 ) = F1 (Q2 ) \u2212\n\nQ2\nF2 (Q2 )\n4m2B\n\nGM (Q2 ) = F1 (Q2 ) + F2 (Q2 ).\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nIn this work, we only calculate the \"connected\" diagram, which means the inserted quark current is contracted\nwith the valence quarks in the baryon interpolating fields. The \"disconnected\" contributions are notoriously noisy and\ndifficult to calculate. Previous works have attempted to estimate their contribution through an indirect approach by\napplying \"charge symmetry\" to the connected ones (including the the octet family)[34, 35]. For GsM (the strange contribution to the magnetic form factor) at small transfer momenta, Adelaide-JLab Collaboration got \u22120.046(19) using\nquenched lattice data with chiral perturbatively corrected vacuum[36] and another dynamical calculation obtained\nGsM = \u22120.06(3) using mixed action[37] with pion mass as low as 360 MeV. The same approach can be applied to the\nelectric form factor, yielding GsE (Q2 = 0.1 GeV2 ) = \u22120.0049(56) in the same dynamical calculation[37]. Recently,\nanother direct calculation from \u03c7QCD Collaboration[38] using the Z4 stochastic method (with unbiased subtractions)\non Nf = 2 + 1 clover fermion lattices, found GsM = \u22120.015(23) and GsE (Q2 = 0.1 GeV2 ) = 0.0022(19).\nAnother independent work done by the Boston group using multigrid techniques on 2-flavor Wilson anisotropic\nlattices with 400 MeV pions also observed GsE consistent with zero over Q2 ranging 0.1\u20131 GeV2 [39]. Both direct and\nindirect approaches indicate the disconnected contributions to the electromagnetic form factors are small, O(10\u22122 ), at\nlow momentum transfer. One would expect the disconnected contributions to become yet smaller at large momentum\ntransfer, where the strong coupling between the loop and the baryon becomes weaker. The light-quark disconnected\ncontribution turns out to be only moderately larger than the strange one. Using the isospin symmetry approach,\nthe ratio of the strange-quark disconnected contribution to the light-quark was estimated to be 0.16(4) and 0.14(4)\nfor electric and magnetic form factors, respectively[36, 40]. We are not aware of any direct calculations of the\ndisconnected quark ratios in the electromagnetic form factors; however, they exist in many other quantities. For\nexample, the strange-to-light ratio of the first moment of the quark momentum fraction is 0.88(7)[41], and the ratios\nfor angular and orbital momentum contributions to the nucleon spin are also around 1[42]. It should be safe to\nestimate that the light disconnected contribution to the electromagnetic form factors is on the same order as the\nstrange disconnected ones: O(10\u22122 ) at low momentum transfer.\n\n\f7\nWe expect the disconnected contributions to become yet smaller as the momentum transfer increases. From the\nmesonic cloud point of view, the disconnected diagram is suppressed by an additional factor of 1/Q2 relative to the\nconnected diagrams; thus, its relative contribution is suppressed at large momentum transfer. For a form factor\nwhose typical magnitude in the low-momentum region is O(1) (such as proton form factors and neutron magnetic\nform factor), the disconnected contributions are smaller than the statistical errors at most momentum points and\nthe systematics from sources such as the nonzero lattice spacing. However, the disconnected contributions could\nsignificantly affect small-magnitude form factors such as the neutron electric form factor. We nevertheless include\nresults from this channel for comparison to other lattice results but remind readers that the neutron electric form\nfactor has larger uncertainty than the other form factors in this calculation.\np,n\nFigures 4 and 5 summarize the quenched and dynamical calculations of the electric Gp,n\nE , magnetic GM and isovector\nv\n2\nDirac and Pauli F1,2 form factors as functions of momentum transfer Q ; the different symbols (colors) indicate\ndifferent quark masses (or equivalently, pion masses) used as input to the calculation, as indicated in the captions of\nthe figures. The dashed lines on these plots are taken from a parametrization of the experimental data[1, 43]. In the\ncase of proton, the parametrization used should be valid up to around 6 GeV2 for GE and 25 GeV2 for GM . The\nneutron form factors are only accurately known to 4.5 GeV2 for GnM and 1.5 GeV2 for GnE ; we extrapolate all the\nexperimental parametrizations through 6 GeV2 for comparison. Later in this section, we will discuss the extrapolation\nof the lattice data to the physical pion mass and the form-factor ratios.\nFrom the experimental parametrization of the Sachs form factors Gp,n\nE,M , we can obtain Dirac and Pauli form factors\nF1,2 by reversing the definitions in Eq. 10:\nGE + \u03c4 GM\n1+\u03c4\n\u2212G\nE + GM\nF2 (Q2 ) =\n1+\u03c4\n\nF1 (Q2 ) =\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nfor both proton and neutron form factors, where \u03c4 = Q2 /(2M )2 . The isovector F v form factors are just F p \u2212 F n . We\nu,d\np,n\ncan further estimate the individual quark contributions F1,2\nin terms of F1,2\nas\np\nu\nn\nF1,2\n(Q2 ) = F1,2\n+ 2F1,2\nd\nF1,2\n(Q2 )\n\n=\n\nn\n2F1,2\n\n+\n\np\nF1,2\n.\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nAll the form factors are nonperturbatively renormalized such that GpE (0) = 1. The largest available transfer\nmomentum from the dynamical lattice is limited by the coarse lattice spacing. The inverse of the spatial lattice\nspacing is only around 1.6 GeV, while in the quenched case it is 2 GeV. Application of the same calculation procedure\non finer lattices could easily extend the largest available transfer momentum. The pion masses used are 1080, 720 and\n480 MeV for the quenched ensembles and 875, 580 and 450 MeV for the dynamical ensembles. Both quenched and\ndynamical form factors display a trend toward the experimental parametrization as the pion mass decreases except\nfor GnE . The quenched form factors have milder pion-mass dependence with around 300-MeV separation, compared\nwith the dynamical calculation. The lightest pion masses in the quenched and dynamical calculations are roughly\nthe same, allowing us to see how the sea-quark contribution influences the form factors. It is immediately obvious in\nGpE that the addition of the sea-quark degrees of freedom lowers the form factors toward the experimental line. GnE\nhas the largest noise-to-signal; the magnitude is at the order of the disconnected contributions mentioned earlier this\nsubsection which could be influencing the connected lattice points significantly.\nThe lattice data show some broad trends: As the lattice momentum used in any given point increases, the noise\nalso increases. In this calculation, this means that the highest transfer-momentum points will have larger uncertainty,\nbut also that there will be some points with smaller transfer momentum that have large uncertainty simply because\nthey are constructed using large initial and final momenta. For purposes of clarity, we omit some of these points with\nvery large errors; all points are included in the fits, although points with large error have little influence.\nA.\n\nIsovector Radii\n\nThe size of the nucleon characterized by the effective charge and magnetic radii can be determined from the\nelectromagnetic form factors. We first examine commonly calculated quantities using Dirac and Pauli isovector\ncurrents, where the disconnected contribution is highly suppressed due to isospin symmetry.\nv\nThe isovector Dirac and Pauli mean-squared radii can be extracted from the isovector electric form factors F1,2\nvia\n!\nv\nF1,2\n(Q2 )\nd\n2\nhr1,2\ni = (\u22126) 2\n.\n(16)\nv (0)\ndQ\nF1,2\nQ2 =0\n\n\f8\n\nFIG. 4: Nucleon form factors on quenched configurations with pion masses of 480 (brown), 720 (orange) and 1080 (purple)\nMeV. The dashed lines are a parametrization of experimental form-factor data[1, 43]\n\nMost groups have studied radii with the Q2 dependence over ranges 0.5\u20132.0 GeV2 among their own data and found\nthe extracted radii to be independent (within the statistical error bars) of Q2 choice[15, 16, 18].\nIt is commonly agreed that a dipole extrapolation should be used for F1v , but opinions differ as to whether a dipole\n(a(Q2 + b)\u22122 ) or tripole (a(Q2 + b)\u22123 ) is preferred for F2v . Refs. [16, 18] found insignificant differences between results\nfor either choice, while Ref. [15] observed some discrepancy and adopted the numbers from the tripole for hr22 i. A\nsummary of all the Nf = 2 + 1 lattice calculations of the isovector radii can be found in Fig. 6. Note that only the\nstatistical errors are shown in this figure.\nThe Dirac and Pauli mean-squared radii from the dynamical ensembles are summarized in Fig. 6 along with other\nNf = 2+1 lattice calculations and lowest-order heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBXPT) using experimental\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 5: Nucleon form factors on 2+1 configurations with pion masses of 450 (brown), 580 (orange) and 875 (purple) MeV. The\ndashed lines are a parametrization of experimental form-factor data[1, 43]\n\ninputs[44]. Our results are nicely in agreement with isotropic Nf = 2 + 1 calculations having various sea and valence\nfermion actions; this demonstrates the universality of the lattice QCD calculations.\nB.\n\nMagnetic Moments\n\nCalculations in a finite volume (without using twisted boundary conditions or an external magnetic field) cannot\ngive us the Q2 \u2248 0 Pauli F2 or magnetic GM form factor. However, we are interested in the (anomalous) magnetic\n\n\f10\n\nFIG. 6: Summary of the isovector Dirac and Pauli mean-squared radii from all currently existing Nf = 2 + 1 nucleon electromagnetic form-factor calculations[15\u201318].

Two approaches are considered: The first method\nis to perform a dipole fit to the Q2 -dependence of the form factors. However, due to the limited minimum momentum\navailable (a constraint related to the lattice box size), the fit form can be poorly constrained in the near-zero Q2\nregion, resulting in fit-instability in obtaining the magnetic moments. The second method can be applied in the small\nQ2 region by polynomial fitting to the ratio of the magnetic to the electric form factor, GM /GE (or F2 /F1 ). The two\nQ2\n2\nis small, we can Taylor expand both form factors\nform factors are expected to be functions of \u03c4 = 4m\n2 . When Q\nN\n(except for the neutron):\nGM /GE = \u03bc/GE (0)(1 + a1 \u03c4 ) + O(\u03c4 2 )\nF2 /F1 = \u03ba/F1 (0)(1 + a1 \u03c4 ) + O(\u03c4 2 ).\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\nBoth methods (dipole fit and linear fit to form-factor ratios) have been performed in a previous study on most of the\noctet baryons[18] and the latter method was found to have good consistency and improved stability. The magnetic\nmoments are related via \u03bcx = \u03bax + ex , where e is the electric charge and x can be proton or up or down quark flavors.\nHere we will only show the dipole form to extract the anomalous magnetic moments from isovector form factors;\nboth approaches give results consistent within statistical errors. To better compare our results with other studies,\nmphys\n\nwe convert \u03ba into the natural units of the nuclear magneton (\u03bcN = 2me N ) by multiplying by mNlat . Our dynamical\nN\nresults are displayed in Fig. 7 along with other Nf = 2 + 1 results. The \u03ba obtained from tripole fitting are consistent\nwith dipole results; similar observations were made by other Nf = 2 + 1 calculations[15\u201317]. Once again, we observe\nthe universal behavior among different groups and lattice-parameter choices. We also note that the lattice results\ndisplay a rather mild dependence on the pion mass in the range from 300 MeV to 850 MeV, yet they are only 2/3\nthe experimental value. We may again expect a rapid rise in the smaller-pion mass region if lattice QCD correctly\nreproduces the experimental values. In Ref. [18], the magnetic moments of the octet baryons were studied with\nSU(3) next-to-leading-order (NLO) HBXPT formulae; they found large discrepancies from the lattice points (with\nthe lightest pion at 350 MeV), suggesting that NNLO effects are significant. We might have similar expectations for\nthe isovector anomalous magnetic moments.\n\n\f11\n\nFIG. 7: Summary of the normalized isovector anomalous magnetic moments from all currently existing Nf = 2 + 1 nucleon\nelectromagnetic form-factor calculations[15\u201318], including this work\n\nC.\n\nChiral Extrapolation of Form Factors\n\nPhenomenologically, as done in Refs. [1, 43], it is common to describe the Q2 -dependence of the experimental GE,M\nQ2\nvia an expansion form\nform-factor data using a dimensionless parameter \u03c4 = 4m\n2\nN\n\nPk\u22122\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 + i=1\nai \u03c4 i\nGp,n\n=\nGpE or M\nPk\n\u03bcp,n\n1 + i=1 bi \u03c4 i\na1 \u03c4\nGD ,\nGnE =\n1 + b1 \u03c4\nwhere k is a selected integer and GD is\n\n(21)\n\n1\n(1+Q2 /(0.71\n\n. Note that in the continuum, there is no difference between\nGeV2 )2\nextrapolating the data in terms of Q or \u03c4 , since the mN is fixed. However, in a lattice calculation where the sea\nand valence quark masses vary, mlat\nN is a function of the pion mass. Using a dimensionless parameter should help to\nu,d\nsmooth the chiral extrapolation. We could also extrapolate F1,2\nthrough a similar procedure as Gp,n\nE,M , except that\nF2 should have one fewer power of \u03c4 ; that is,\nPk\u22122\na0 + i=1 ai \u03c4 i\nF1 =\nPk\n1 + i=1 bi \u03c4 i\nPk\u22123\n\u0012 \u0013\n1 + i=1 ai \u03c4 i\nF2\n=\n.\n(22)\nPk\n\u03ba\n1 + i=1 bi \u03c4 i\n2\n\nTo extrapolate to the physical pion mass, we can use one of several different approaches: First, we could use a\nsimultaneous fit to the \u03c4 and m\u03c0 dependence where the fit parameters, ai and bi in Eqs. 21 and 22 are in terms of\nm2\u03c0 . A second approach is to fit data for each lattice momentum as a function of Q2 (m2\u03c0 ). Each data point f (Q2 , m2\u03c0 )\ncomposes with the same kinematic momentum combination can then be extrapolated to the physical point, where we\ncan further apply Eqs. 21 and 22 to fit the Q2 dependence.\nIn this work, we simultaneously fit the m\u03c0 and Q2 (or \u03c4 ) dependence of the lattice data, expanding each fit parameter\n(1)\n(0)\nin terms of the pion mass: ai = ai + ai m2\u03c0 . The pion masses on these ensembles are heavy enough that the linear\nansatz for squared-pion-mass dependence should hold, simplifying the complicated extrapolation. This doubles the\nnumber of fitting parameters, but increases the number of data points by a factor of the number of pion masses used\n(3 in our case). Figure 8 shows an example of the extrapolations on the isovector Dirac and Pauli form factor in the\nv\ndynamical ensembles. The \u03c72 /dof for F1,2\nare 1.4 and 2.0, respectively. The points and their corresponding symbols\nare the same as those in Fig. 5 and now we have the Q2 extrapolation line with statistical error band going through\nthese lattice points. Further, the lowest line/band represents the extrapolated form factors at the physical pion mass.\nWe repeat a similar process for both quenched (Nf = 0) and dynamical (Nf = 2 + 1) on other form factors.\nWe find good agreement for the extrapolation to the physical pion mass in Fig. 8; that is, the curvature (which\ncorresponds to the charge radii) as a function of Q2 fits nicely with interpolating forms derived from experimental\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 8: Isovector Dirac and Pauli form-factor extrapolation using Nf = 2 + 1 calculations in this work. The shaded bands\nshow the simultaneous fit at the pion mass corresponding to each data set, where the color of the band matches the color of\nthe points. The lowest gray band is the extrapolation to the physical pion mass.\n\ndata. This seems to contradict what we obtained in Subsec. III A. Note that the difference in terms of Q2 and \u03c4\n2\ndependence is a factor of 4(mlat\nN ) . This makes no difference in the continuum, since the nucleon mass is a fixed\nconstant. However, in lattice-QCD calculations, where the quark masses are varied (as shown Fig. 2), this could\ncreate a strong dependence. The good agreement in the radii extrapolation might be due to cancellation between the\nchiral curvatures in the nucleon mass and the radii. We compare our results with RBC/UKQCD Nf = 2 + 1 results\n2\nand observe similar behavior. Figure 9 shows the same Nf = 2 + 1 products of the Dirac and Pauli radii with 4(mlat\nN )\nfrom our and RBC/UKQCD Nf = 2 + 1 results. The results are encouraging; the notorious charge radii problem may\nbe ameliorated by looking at dimensionless quantities. In the Dirac radii product case, the discrepancy is improved\nto within a few standard deviations and even smaller for the Pauli radii product. However, further investigation and\nimprovement in the statistical errors of these calculations will be required to fully understand the nature of these\ndimensionless quantities.\n\nFIG. 9: Summary of the \"scaled\" isovector Dirac and Pauli mean-squared radii from our and RBC/UKQCD Nf = 2+1 nucleon\nelectromagnetic form-factor calculations[17]\n\nFigure 10 shows the proton Sachs, Dirac and Pauli form factors at the physical pion mass from both quenched and\ndynamical ensembles. The dashed lines are the experimental parametrization as mentioned in earlier subsections.\nWe find a significant difference in the results using quenched or dynamical ensembles, most strongly reflected in the\nelectric and Dirac form factors. These form factors are better constrained due to the fixed data point at Q2 = 0,\nand the dynamical extrapolations are only a couple of sigma away from the experimental line; the quenched results\nare consistently higher. The magnetic and Pauli form factor extrapolations, on the contrary, fail to reproduce the\n(anomalous) magnetic moments, similar to what we discuss in the magnetic moment subsection, and the extrapolations\ndiverge around zero transfer momentum. To our surprise the dynamical and quenched results are consistent for the\nproton Pauli form factor. An examination of the original lattice data to make sure that this is not caused by the\nextrapolation verifies that the similarity comes from the data. This indicates that the Pauli form factor (for the\n\n\f13\nproton) is not very sensitive to whether the QCD vacuum contains fermion degrees of freedom.\nFigure 11 shows a similar plot for the neutron form factors. These include the neutron electric and Dirac form\nfactors, although we again caution that there could be significant disconnected contributions that are ignored in this\ncalculation. Therefore, it is not fair to compare just the connected contribution with the experimental data; we\nprovide it as a guide line to remark on the differences. The smallness of the quenched extrapolation error band is\ndue to the large statistics and less-correlated data points, as seen in Fig. 4. We note that as we anticipated, the\nconnected-only contribution agrees fairly well at large transfer momentum; this suggests an interpretation assigning\nthe remaining discrepancy at low transfer momentum to the omitted disconnected terms. The neutron magnetic and\nPauli form factors suffer from similar problems to those from the proton, that the fits are less constrained and the\nquenched magnetic form factor has obviously divergent behavior. Also similar to the proton case, the neutron Pauli\nform factor shows indifference to the fermionic vacuum.\nFigure 12 shows the individual quark and isovector contributions to the Dirac and Pauli form factors. The dashed\nlines are constructed from the proton and neutron electric and magnetic experimental parameterizations form factors,\nas shown in Eq. 15. On the lattice, we can explicitly pick out the individual quark contributions by varying the input\nquark currents. Once again, we see the difference between quenched and dynamical is significant for the Dirac and\nnegligible for the Pauli form factors. The dynamical results for both up and down quarks are below the experimental\nreconstruction of the quark contributions, which may vary for future precision neutron form factors. However, the\nlinear combinations of up and down for the proton and isovector form factors seem to cancel the difference and become\nagreeable with experiment. The Pauli form factors are within two sigma of the experimental values except in the\nlow-Q2 region.\n\nFIG. 10: Proton form factors on both quenched (purple) and dynamical (orange) ensembles. The dashed line represents the\nexperimental parametrization and the lines with bands are from the lattice calculations.\n\nD.\n\nTransverse Densities\n\nFollowing the discussions of Ref. [26] (and subsequent studies for other hadrons: pion density in Ref. [45], N -P11\nin Ref. [46] and deuteron in Ref. [47]; see Ref. [48] for a detailed review), we now attempt to translate our extracted\n\n\f14\n\nFIG. 11: Neutron form factors on both quenched (purple) and dynamical (orange) ensembles. The dashed line represents the\nexperimental parametrization and the lines with bands are from the lattice calculations.\n\nnucleon form factors into a description of the spatial structure of the nucleon. Although the form factors are typically\nthought of as being the Fourier transforms of the nucleon wavefunction, there is a complication due to the imparted\nmomentum at the vertex. Since the incoming and outgoing states have different momentum, their wavefunctions are\nnot identical. We can avoid this difficulty by only attempting to describe the spatial structure in the plane transverse\nto an infinite momentum boost. Thus the transverse charge density is defined as the Fourier transform of the form\nfactor in such a plane:\nZ 2\nd q\n\u03c1(b) \u2261\nF1 (q2 )eiq*b ,\n(23)\n(2\u03c0)2\nwhere bold vectors b and q lie in the transverse plane. Equivalently,\nZ \u221e\nQ dQ\n\u03c1(b) =\nJ0 (bQ)F1 (Q2 ),\n2\u03c0\n0\n\n(24)\n\nfor scalar b, where J0 is a Bessel function. We can perform this integral numerically, using the F1 (Q2 ) obtained by\nextrapolating our fit form to the physical pion mass.\nThe nature of the Bessel integral, oscillatory and exponentially declining, means that the central core of the\ndistribution is most strongly impacted by large-Q2 form factors. If we wish to well characterize this part of the\nnucleon density functions, we need precise information about form factors in the upper range of transfer momentum.\nWe demonstrate this effect by restricting the dynamical data set to the region Q < 2 GeV2 (which is the upper limit\nof transfer momentum for many lattice QCD calculations). Then we compare this result to the density obtained from\nusing all the available lattice Q2 . Figure 13 shows in red the effect of omitting the highest Q2 data (above 2 GeV2 ),\ncompared to the blue which uses all Q2 from the dynamical ensembles. The impact is significant in the central core,\nas we anticipated; omitting information about large transfer momenta results in a deviation in the density around\n25%.\nOur results for the transverse charge densities of the proton, neutron, up and down quark contributions, are shown\nin Fig. 14, along with the same quantity using a parametrization of experimental data from Ref. [1, 43]. Overall, we\n\n\f15\n\nFIG. 12: Quark contributions to the form factors on both quenched (purple) and dynamical (orange) ensembles. The dashed\nline represents the experimental parametrization and the lines with bands are from the lattice calculations.\n\nobserve that the dynamical content of the vacuum appears to have a strong influence on the transverse charge densities\nin all cases; we see large differences between the quenched and dynamical results. In particular, the effect appears\nto increase the density of the core region for quenched ensembles. This difference could be plausibly assigned to the\npresence of a mesonic cloud in the dynamical case, which spreads out the charge distribution. Since the quenched\nensembles do not include the effects of sea quarks, a nucleon in that environment does not couple to baryon-meson\nsystems in the usual way.\nIn the proton channel, there is quite good agreement between our dynamical and experimental results. This might\nseem suprising, given the omission of the disconnected diagram from our calculation. However, it is a relatively\nsmall contribution to the proton Dirac form factor; we expect it to be at the level of a percent in this case. Since the\nquenched F1 form factor lies above the experimental one throughout the entire Q2 region we calculated, it accumulates\na large contribution to the density near the core region. The density becomes smaller than the experimental value at\nlarger distances due to the oscillatory nature of the Bessel function. Similar behavior also occurs in other channels.\nThe neutron density is expected to have the largest systematics due to the neglect of the disconnected contributions\n\n\f16\n\nFIG. 13: The transverse charge density \u03c1(b) of the proton in the central region with different cuts applied to the F1 data prior\nto fitting. The lower blue band uses all available Q2 from the 2+1-flavor ensembles; the upper red band uses only data with\nQ2 < 2 GeV2 . The experimental result derived from the parametrization of Ref. [1, 43] is shown as a dashed line.\n\nin this work. Even so, we observe only about a 25% difference between the dynamical results and experiment,\nsurprising considering that the disconnected value is on the same order as the neutron form factor itself. Once again,\nthe difference becomes much more significant in the quenched case, and the even larger negative core charge density\nis consistent with suppression of mesonic contributions.\nThe experimental up and down densities are calculated using linear combinations of the experimental parametrizations of the proton and neutron Dirac form factors, as shown in Eqs. 15. The lattice ones are calculated directly\nusing inserted vector currents with specific quark flavors. As in the proton case, the disconnected diagrams should\nbe minimal. The agreement between the dynamical results and experiment for individual quark contributions is not\nas good as in the case of the proton; in particular, the down-quark density is smaller. It is also notable here that the\nup-quark distribution is more sharply peaked in the core than the down-quark distribution.\nAnother kind of transverse density can be derived for the magnetic moment of the nucleons, the transverse magnetization density. The anomalous magnetic moment density is defined as a Fourier transformation of the F2 form\nfactor:\nZ 2\nd q\n\u03c1M (b) \u2261\nF2 (q2 )e\u2212iq*b .\n(25)\n(2\u03c0)2\nHowever, Ref. [26] finds it more convenient to consider this in terms of a magnetization density. Therefore, we take a\nderivative with respect to the by direction orthogonal to the magnetic field. This yields\n\u2202\u03c1M (b)\n\u2202by\nZ \u221e 2\nQ dQ\n2\n= b sin \u03c6\nJ1 (bQ)F2 (Q2 ),\n2\u03c0\n0\n\n\u03c1\u0303M (b) \u2261 \u2212by\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the angle between b and the magnetic field. Again, we calculate this quantity for the proton, neutron, upand down-quark contributions to the proton and the isovector. We show one-dimensional cuts of the magnetization\ndensity along the \u03c6 = \u03c0/2 axis of the transverse plane in Fig. 15. We also show the full dependence of the proton and\nneutron magnetization densities across the transverse plane in Fig. 16.\nFor the magnetization, we see poorer agreement with experiment than in the case of transverse charge density,\nbut better agreement between the quenched and dynamical cases. The Pauli form factors from the dynamical and\nquenched ensembles are relatively similar (unlike the Dirac form factors), and this results in similar magnetization\ndensities. The discrepancy in the up-quark channel is strongly reflected in the up-quark dominated proton, despite\nthe down-quark contribution having relatively closer agreement with experiment; the converse effect is seen in the\nneutron.\nIn Subsec. III B, we found most anomalous magnetic moments from the lattice calculation were roughly 2/3 the\nexperimental values; this leads to a discrepancy in the overall scales of the densities. Also the fit forms for the\nDirac form factors are better constrained in the low transfer-momentum region by conservation of charge, resulting in\nsmaller discrepancies at large distances than the magnetization density. To get a better picture of the magnetization\ndensity, one would also need a better knowledge of the low transfer momentum form factors.

[1, 43] is shown as a dashed line.\n\ntwisted boundary conditions can provide smaller momenta for a particular combination of lattice spacing and box\nsize, which should help to ameliorate these discrepancies.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this work, we attempted to determine the large-Q2 form factors in lattice QCD. Using operators that have\nvarious degrees of overlap with boosted states in form-factor calculations significantly improves the signal. Here we\ndemonstrated the method using a simple baryon operator with various smearing parameters. Since baryon systems\ntypically have worse signal-to-noise ratio than mesons, the method should be applicable to other hadronic systems.\nWe analyzed the nucleon ground-state form factor by explicitly including excited-state contributions. This allowed\nus to extract the ground-state signal more precisely, and combined with the use of a longer source-sink separation,\nreduces systematic uncertainty coming from excited-state contamination.\nWe checked the most commonly considered observables such as the Dirac and Pauli radii and anomalous magnetic\nmoments on our dynamical ensemble, and compared with other Nf = 2 + 1 calculations, finding reasonable agreement\n2 2\nwithin the statistical errors. When we looked at the the dimensionless quantities 4(mlat\nN ) hr1,2 i in the later section,\nthe chiral curvature was significantly reduced in our data; we further found the naive (linear) chiral extrapolation\nrecovered the experimental values. Similar behavior was also seen in the RBC/UKQCD lighter pion-mass data points.\nPerforming further investigation of such dimensionless quantities with higher signal-to-noise ratios in the lighter pionmass region would be interesting. Nevertheless, the agreement in the low-Q2 behavior among calculations with\nNf = 2 + 1 demonstrates a nice universality among various fermion actions.\nWe extended our study to the high-Q2 region where no lattice-QCD calculations had reached in the past. We found\nsignificant differences in the Dirac form factor between quenched and dynamical studies, indicating non-negligible\nsystematic error due to quenching, while Pauli form factors appear less sensitive to sea-fermion effects. We compared\nour results with an interpolation to experimental results as a function of Q2 , although our knowledge of the Q2 -\n\n\f18\n\nFIG. 15: The transverse magnetization density \u03c1\u0303M (b) of the proton (upper left), neutron (upper right), up (lower left) and\ndown (lower right) quark contributions, obtained by integrating the fitted F1 form at the physical pion mass.

The\nexperimental result derived from the parametrization of Ref. [1, 43] is shown as a dashed line.\n\nFIG. 16: The two-dimensional dependence of the transverse magnetization density \u03c1\u0303M (b) of the proton (left) and neutron\n(right). Black indicates the lowest values, followed by purple, orange and white in increasing order. For the proton, zero is\nblack and values are positive; for the neutron zero is white and values are negative. Figure 15 corresponds to slices through\nthe vertical axis.\n\n\f19\ndependence of the GnE form factor remains limited. These experimental lines may change after the collection of future\nprecision and large-Q2 neutron form factor data. Our lattice neutron form factors extend as far as 4\u20136 GeV2 but\ndue to the omission of \"disconnected\" diagrams (which are expected to contribute at O(10\u22122 )), the F1n and GnE form\nfactors in our calculations suffer from comparable systematic error. However, the other form factors (including those\nfor up and down quarks) have relatively large magnitudes, making such O(10\u22122 ) systematic uncertainty at the level\nof the statistical error; thus, these should be more reliable compared with experiment. All calculations may be further\nimproved with lighter pions and more statistics.\nWe look at the transverse charge and magnetization densities using the infinite-momentum frame definition from\nDirac and Pauli form factors. For these quantities, we see (possibly coincidental) exceptional agreement with experiment for the charge density of the proton. The level of agreement is particularly striking when compared to the\nquenched results. The neutron charge density agrees less well, as best seen in the isovector charge density, where\nthe central density (inside 0.2 fm) greatly exceeds experiment. Since this region is most sensitive to high-Q2 contributions, large systematics probably exist for both the lattice and experimental measurements. We showed that the\nmagnetization densities are much less susceptible to sea-quark effects. In this case, the proton magnetization density\nhas greater tension with experiment than the neutron density, but neither is in particularly good agreement.\nWe have presented lattice calculations in the large momentum-transfer region up to 4 and 6 GeV2 . Our currently\naccessible momenta are limited by the available lattice spacing in the calculation, but this will soon be improved as\nfiner lattices become available. The signals presented can be further improved by reducing the source-sink separation\nwith the same analysis procedure; we plan to proceed in that direction and crosscheck with the calculation done in this\nwork. Future generalizations to operators constructed in irreducible representations of the cubic group will probably\nallow us to analyze form factors for radially excited states of the nucleons.\nTo reach even higher Q2 regions, we propose performing a numerical step-scaling calculation (for example, Ref. [49]).\nOn a small volume with very fine lattice spacing, we can easily reach high momentum. By calculating the step-scaling\nfunction at overlapping momentum points (or interpolating momentum function) we can reduce the systematic error\ndue to finite-volume or lattice discretization artifacts. However, generating several volumes of dynamical Nf = 2 + 1\nlattices requires a large amount of computational resources; we hope such a proposal will become feasible as the\npetascale computing facilities become available in the near future.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was done using the Chroma software suite[50]; part of the propagator calculation used the EigCG\nsolver[51]; and calculations were performed on clusters at Jefferson Laboratory using time awarded under the USQCD\nInitiative.
