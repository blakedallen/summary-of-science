Introduction\nDirectional detection is a promising non-baryonic Dark Matter search strategy allowing to distinguish a genuine WIMP event from background events. The\ngoal is to show the correlation of the signal with the direction of solar motion in\nthe galactic halo [1, 2]. This implies a reconstruction of the recoil track down\nto a few keV. As the required exposure is decreased by an order of magnitude\nwhen going from 2D read-out to 3D read-out [3], 3D track reconstruction is\nneeded down to a few keV. This can be achieved by using gaseous micro-TPC\ndetectors, for which several gases have been suggested : CF4 ,3 He + C4 H10 , CH4\nor C4 H10 [4, 5]. In particular, the MIMAC (MIcro TPC MAtrix of Chambers)\ncollaboration [5, 6, 7] is planning to build a multi-target detector, composed\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor\nEmail address: olivier.bourrion@lpsc.in2p3.fr (O. Bourrion)\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n\nOctober 7, 2018\n\n\fFigure 1: Schematic of the MIMAC micro-TPC using a micromegas\n\nof a matrix of Micromegas gaseous micro-TPC detectors [8, 9]. A pixelized\nmicromegas bulk [9] is used in order to perform a 3D reconstruction of a few\nmm track. It is segmented in 350 \u03bcm pixels associated to a dedicated ASIC\ndescribed here. The pixels of each 96 x-rows are linked in jumps of 1 pixel over\nthe 96 y-columns ones forming an interwoven anode of strips of pixels. Indeed,\nfor a given x-row, one out of two pixels is connected to the same strip. Then,\nfor the next x-row, pixels are connected in a staggered arrangement. Same rule\napply for y-columns. The location of the pixels fired is then obtained by using the coincidence among the x and y strips. This read-out strategy permits\nto reduce the number of channels for covering a large anode surface as needed\nfor the direct dark matter detection. As shown on figure 1, the coordinates in\nthe anode plane (x and y coordinates) are reconstructed by collecting primary\nelectrons produced in the drift region with an electric field (\u22641 kV/cm) and\namplified in the avalanche region (\u223c80 kV/cm). The recoil is thus projected\non the anode, providing 2D information on the track. As stated above, 3D\ntrack reconstruction is needed for directional detection of dark matter. This is\nachieved by sampling the anode signal every 25 ns. Knowing the electron drift\nvelocity, information on the third coordinate is retrieved. For instance, in 3 He\nat 350 mbar with a drift field of 200 V/cm, the drift velocity is 16 \u03bcm/ns and\nthe recoil track is then decomposed in voxels of typically 350 \u00d7 350 \u00d7 400 \u03bcm3 .\nA dedicated 3D reconstruction algorithm has been developed, allowing to reach\nan angular resolution better than 10\u25e6 . More details may be found in [10].\n\n2\n\n\f2. Design of the front end ASIC\n2.1. Background\nThe MIMAC detector is planned to be a multi-target detector, i.e. composed\nof a matrix of chambers filled with several gases. In order to define the ASIC\nspecifications, we focused on 3 He and 19 F. In the case of 3 He the following\ninformations have been used:\n\u2022 the mean energy to produce a e\u2212 / ion pair is 41 eV;\n\u2022 the drift velocity is 16 \u03bcm/ns at 350 mbar and a drift field of 200 V/cm;\n\u2022 chamber gain is \u223c5000;\n\u2022 minimum signal is \u223c 5000 e\u2212 (approximated to a current triangular pulse\nwith a base width of 5 ns and an amplitude of 300 nA );\n\u2022 with a drift field of 200 V/cm and a pressure of 350 mbar, the p\nelectron\ncloud radius at one \u03c3 due to the diffusion is roughly 450 \u03bcm \u00d7 L(cm)\nwhere L is the distance from the point of interaction to the anode.\nDirectional detection of dark matter implies the measurement of low energy\nrecoil tracks. Typically, for a 3 He \u03bcTPC detector, the range of interest for dark\nmatter lies below \u223c10 keV (50 keV for CF4 ), with a sub-keV threshold. Moreover, this \u03bcTPC detector will be used for neutron metrology up to higher energies (2 MeV) [11]. Hence, the prototype ASIC has been designed and developed\nwith extra functionalities to demonstrate that the gaseous chamber associated\nwith its electronics can measure the energy and track of particles over a wide\nrange of energies. This will allow the measurement of low energy electrons (used\nfor calibration purposes), low energy nuclear recoils (from WIMP interaction)\nand even MeV alpha particles. This implies a track measurement with lengths\nranging from a few millimetres to a few centimetres. Table 2.1 presents ranges\nand energy losses for various particles. For the ASIC specification, a dynamic\nrange from 300 eV to 1000 keV was chosen. It should be noticed that even for\nan incoming alpha particle at high pressure the energy channel could saturate\nand in that case the track length would be enough for discrimination.\nThe lowest charge that has to be measured by ionization in the dynamic\nrange chosen is 300 eV equivalent to 1 keV recoil at 350 mbar [12]. It will\nproduce, in the case of 3 He, 7-8 primary electrons that will drift to the amplification space covering a surface determined by the square root of the drift\ndistance in cm. Therefore, the lowest charge to measure will be defined by the\ngain (\u223c 5000) which has to permit the detection of a primary electron giving\n5000 e\u2212 on one strip of pixels. Knowing the approximate shape of the signal,\nthe lowest current to measure is \u223c300 nA. This narrows the choice of the front\nend amplification electronics to a charge preamplifier (no current leakage and\nlow noise).\n\n3\n\n\fX-source\n\n55\n\nFe: e\u2212\n\n57\n\nsource Co:\ninternal conversion e\u2212\nion source:\n3\nHe and 4 He recoils\n\nRange\n(pressure and gas dependant)\n6 mm (1 bar) to\n18 mm (350 mbar)\n1 mm \u2212\u2192 1 cm\n(1 bar)\n\n0.5 keV; 5 keV\n7 keV; 13 keV\n\nfew \u03bcm to few mm\n\nfrom 0.5 \u2212\u2192 50 keV\n\nneutron capture\n\n\u223c5 cm (p+ ) (1 bar)\n\nAlpha\n\nup to chamber size (350 mbar)\n\nEnergy\n5.9 keV\n\n100 keV/cm\n573 keV + 191 keV\n\u223c5 MeV\n\nTable 1: Range and energy loss of various particles in the MIMAC detector\n\n2.2. Architecture overview\nThe front end chip is composed of sixteen channels as presented on figure\n2. Each channel consists of a charge preamplifier with two outputs. Its voltage\noutput is connected to one of the sixteen inputs of a common summing shaper\nand its current output feeds a discriminator. The sixteen discriminator outputs\nare sampled and serialized over two differential lines in order to reduce the\nsystem connections. The summing shaper provides the energy released in the\ndetector with two gains. Low gain range is from 300 eV (noise level) to 1 MeV\nand high gain range is from 300 eV to 80 keV. The position and the inclination\nof the incident particle track are provided in real time by the digital outputs\nvia the signal duration.\n2.3. Input stage\nIn order to maximize the signal to noise ratio, the input stage (see figure 3)\nconsists of a low noise charge preamplifier based on a folded cascode structure\nwith a large interdigitated PMOS input transistor [5000 \u03bcm/0.35 \u03bcm]. Due\nto the fact that the electronics are auto triggered the capacitor is discharged\nthrough a resistor with a decay time constant of 8 \u03bcs. To obtain the total energy\nsignal, the voltage output is connected to one of the sixteen shaper inputs to be\nsummed and filtered.\nThe integration current, flowing through the capacitor, is copied and amplified with a gain of 15 to generate the input signal of the current comparator\n[13]. Two cascode transistors were added to the CMOS inverter, here used as\nan amplifier, in order to decrease the influence of the input to output parasitic\ncapacitor. Optimal vn2 and vp2 values were determined by simulation. Also,\nfor improving the comparator commutation speed, the CMOS inverter is kept\nin linear mode by the use of the two feedback transistors. The other benefit\nof this architecture is that the injected charges in the transistors grids is minimized, therefore further decreasing the turn on and turn off times. Vn1 and vp1\nare adjusted by simulation for barely maintaining the two feedback transistors\n4\n\n\fFigure 2: Block diagram of the MIMAC ASIC\n\n\"OFF\" in the quiescent state of the comparator (no input current, no threshold applied). When a threshold current (provided by a 5 bit DAC) is applied,\none of the two feedback transistors starts conducting allowing the current flow.\nThen, when an input current higher than the current threshold is applied, the\npreviously conducting transistor is switched off, the CMOS inverter toggles and\nthe other feedback transistor starts conducting. At the output, the comparator\ndelivers a digital signal whose duration is equal to the current duration. This\nsignal is sampled at a rate of 40 MHz. Biasing voltages \"vnx\" and \"vpx\" are\ninternally generated.\nIn order to be able to use this reduced resolution DAC, a trade off has been\nmade and an auto zero amplifier has been added for minimizing the DC offset\ncurrent in the output branch of the preamplifier (essentially due to transistor\nmismatches) and thus optimizing the usable DAC range. At a slow rate (1 Hz)\nthe current output of the preamplifier is disconnected from the discriminator\nand connected to one of the differential amplifier inputs. The offset current\ncharges or discharges a capacitor and the amplifier compares the voltage capacitor to the DC input voltage of the current comparator. The offset correction\nis applied to the output branch via a current mirror and the \"control\" line.\nDuring the auto-zero DC correction, a certain isolation to the input signal has\nto be implemented in order to provide adequate offset cancellation. For this,\nseries resistors and long channel transistors have been added. The gate voltage\n\"V clamp\", which is accessible outside of the ASIC, provides an adjustment of\nthe filtering time constant.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 3: Single channel composed of a low noise preamplifier input, an autozero for offset\ncompensation and a comparator\n\n2.4. Energy channel\nTo measure the total energy released in the ionisation channel by the incident\nparticle, the sixteen preamplifier outputs are summed and filtered. The signal\nduration depends on the track inclination, it can last from 10 ns (track of 300 \u03bcm\nin 3 He at 1 bar) up to 6 \u03bcs (track of 15 cm). A CR-RC3 structure has been\nchosen for the shaper with two gains in a ratio of 12.5 and a time constant\nof 200 ns (figure 4). The higher gain increases the precision of the energy\nmeasurement in the lower range (up to 80 keV) corresponding to most of the\nexpected experimental results. For the time constants the passive components\nare realized with specific layers available in the SiGe process: high resistivity\npolysilicon and polysilicon-sinker (bipolar collector) for the capacitor.\n6\n\n\fFigure 4: Schematic of the shaper having two gains in a ratio of 12.5\n\nAll the operational amplifiers are based on a similar structure (figure 5) to\nachieve a gain bandwidth of 170 MHz with a phase margin of 63\u25e6 and an open\nloop gain of 80 dB fully compatible with the gains and time constants chosen\nfor the shaper (figure 6).\nThe oscillogram (see figure 7) shows the response of the charge preamplifier\nand the high gain shaper to an input current pulse.\nThey are in good agreement (with respect to amplitude and peaking time)\nwith the simulation results (figure 8). It can be noted that the preamplifier\nnon-exponential decay is due to the parasitic capacitance of the 4 M\u03a9 feedback\nresistor (figure 3), implemented in the high resistivity polysilicon layer, and that\nit has no negative impact on the shaper output.\n2.5. Serializer\nOne major difficulty of this front end ASIC is to get all the comparator\noutputs out of the chip. This is a concern for several reasons. First, the interconnection has to be kept to a minimum in order to equip large detectors\nand second, the noise level induced by these outputs has to be kept low. This\nlast reason leads to the choice of LVDS differential output. The problem is that\nthis kind of standard display other difficulties, large number of outputs (two\ntimes the number of inputs; one has to remember that the complete MIMAC\ndetector will have around 1000 channels), large current consumption and thus\nlarge power dissipation. The remedy to this is to implement a serializer that\nwill work 8 times faster and thus time multiplex data into a single differential\npair.\nInstead of providing the 8 differential data at a rate of 40 MHz, the data can\nbe transferred on a single pair at a rate of 320 MHz. Using this solution, one\nmore signal (differential as well) is required for synchronization, it is the 40 MHz\nreference clock, it avoids to carry an extra signal commutating at 320 MHz.\n7\n\n\fFigure 5: Operational amplifier schematic\n\nWhen taking a close look at the waveform (see figure 9), one can see that each\nbit is always at the same time offset from the reference clock rising edge. This\nsynchronisation signal can be shared by a large number of serializer outputs, as\nlong as each serializer uses the same 320 MHz clock.\nThe 320 MHz clock is generated by a Phase Locked Loop circuit synchronized\nwith the 40 MHz reference clock. This \"classical\" PLL structure [14] needs only\npassive external components for the charge pump reference current and filter.\nThe LVDS transmitter and receiver are based on structures described in [15].\nFor testing purposes, a multiplexer is implemented just before the serializer.\nThat enables the user to select either the sending of a known pattern or the\ncomparator output. The oscillogram of the outputs can be seen in figure 10,\nwhere a fixed pattern was sent, bottom is serial data 0xAA, middle is the serial\ndata 0xEA, top is the input clock of 40 MHz.\n3. Validation of the front end ASIC with the prototype detector\nIn order to validate the front end ASIC design and concept, a 3.36\u00d73.36 cm2\nprototype anode featuring 2 \u00d7 96 strips of pixels was coupled to an acquisition\nboard. It was equipped with 2 \u00d7 6 ASICs and FPGAs for triggering and hardware level processing. Each strip composed of 96 pixels was connected to one\nASIC input channel. The digital outputs were connected directly to the FPGA\nand the shaper outputs were used to feed peak detectors coupled with ADCs.\nThe FPGA uses the de-serialized front end digital output information for local\ntriggering (an OR of the 16 discriminator outputs).

For each trigger, the FPGA records and\ndecodes each ASIC track informations (pre-processing stage) and retrieves the\nshaper amplitude from the relevant ADC.\nIn the last stage of the hardware processing, the track and energy informations issued by the ASIC monitoring the involved pixel strips are merged and\ntransferred to the reconstruction and on-line display software.\n4. Conclusion\nTwelve of these prototype chips (figure 11) have been mounted on a prototype \u03bcTPC composed of 2 \u00d7 96 strips of pixels covering 3.36 \u00d7 3.36 cm2 =\n11.3 cm2 . The detector has been used in various experimental configurations.\nThe data acquisition electronics board and software will be presented in a forthcoming paper [16]. A dedicated 3D reconstruction algorithm is needed to take\nfull advantage of the potential of the detector [10]. As an example, a 3D track\nreconstruction obtained with a MIMAC prototype detector is presented in figure\n12. It has been obtained in 95% 4 He+C4 H10 at a pressure of 350 mbar and with\na drift field of 200 V/cm. Figure 12 presents this track projected on the X,Y\nplane (the anode one) on the left panel. The middle (resp. right) panel presents\nthe track measurement in the Y,Z (and X,Z) plane. This example outlines the\npossibility to obtain 3D track measurement down to keV energy particles with\na gaseous \u03bcTPC equipped with the front end ASIC presented in this paper.\nIt has been shown by simulations and experimental results, that the MIMAC ASIC offers great possibilities for 3D track reconstruction and ultimately\nfor directional dark matter detection.\n9\n\n\fFigure 7: Oscillogram of the charge preamplifier and shaper response to a current pulse\n\nA 64 channels version of this ASIC is under test, it includes some minor improvements such as:\n\u2022 Increased shaper time constant in order to reduce the energy measurement\ndifference between short and long duration tracks\n\u2022 An increase of the maximum serial rate in order to reach the 50 MHz\nsampling rate\n\u2022 Removal of the synchronisation clock (known patterns will be used for\nsynchronisation)\n\u2022 The addition of a stretcher after each discriminator in order to cope with\nshort duration tracks (< 20 ns)\nAcknowledgement\nC.G and the MIMAC collaboration acknowledge the ANR-07-BLAN-0255-03\nfunding.\n\n10\n\n\f0 Input current\n\nIin (uA)\n\n\u22121.0\n\u22122.0\n\u22123.0\n\u22124.0\n\u22125.0\n250 PAC output\n\nPAC (mV)\n\n200\n150\n100\n50.0\n0\n\nHG (mV)\n\n\u221250.0\n100 Shaper High Gain\n\n\u2212300\n\n\u2212700\n0\n\n5.0\n\n10\ntime (us)\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 8: Simulation of the charge preamplifier and shaper response to a current pulse\n\nFigure 9: Content of the serial frame, each bit is always at the same time offset from the\nreference clock rising edge\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 10: Test pattern measurement : top is 40 MHz clock, middle is serial data 0xEA,\nbottom is serial data 0xAA\n\nFigure 11: Picture of the ASIC (BiCMOS-SiGe 0.35 \u03bcm - Area \u223c15 mm2 )\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 12: 3D reconstructed track of a 5.9 keV electron in 95% 4 He + C4 H10 at a pressure of\n350 mbar and a drift field of 200 V/cm.
