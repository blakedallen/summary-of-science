The Einstein's Equations read\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u03baT\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(1)\n\nand for any metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd , an Einstein tensor G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd can be calculated; so, the\nmetric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd can be claimed to solve Einstein's Equations for the source given\nby the stress-energy-momentum tensor T\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd /\u03ba (If one wants to include a cosmological constant \u039b in Einstein's equations, the argument can\nbe modified in an obvious way). Therefore the question of the validity of\na solution leads to the question of the acceptability of the required stressenergy-momentum tensor, i.e. existence or nonexistence of matter or fields\ncorresponding to that T\u03bc\u03bd . General Relativity is of no help here, the intrinsic\nproperties of matter or fields are outside its realm.\nSome general requirements for T\u03bc\u03bd are proposed, collectively known as\nenergy conditions (e.g. [3]). For example, the weak energy condition states\nthat the energy density should be nonnegative according to every observer.\nAlternatively, one might choose to impose strong or dominant energy conditions. If the source is a perfect fluid, the stress-energy-momentum tensor\ntakes the form\nT\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c1 + p)u\u03bc u\u03bd + pg\u03bc\u03bd\n(2)\nwhere \u03c1 and p are the energy density and pressure, respectively, as measured\nby an observer moving with the fluid, and u\u03bc is its four-velocity. In this case\nthe weak energy condition takes the form \u03c1 \u2265 0, \u03c1 + p \u2265 0; the strong energy\ncondition the form \u03c1 + p \u2265 0, \u03c1 + 3p \u2265 0; the dominant energy condition\nthe form \u03c1 \u2265 |p|. Various tests of acceptability along these lines, such as\npositivity of energy density and pressure, regularity at origin, subluminal\nsound speed, etc. are applied to 127 listed candidates for SSSPF solutions\nin [1].\nBut on one hand, singularities are unavoidable in various contexts, notably gravitational collapse [4]. The singularity theorems prove this by using\nvarious energy conditions as prerequisites. On the other hand, negative energy densities are possible in Quantum Field Theory [5]. Examples include\n2\n\n\fthe well-known Casimir Effect [6], squeezed states of light [7, 8, 9] and radiation from moving mirrors [10]. While uncertainty-principle-like restrictions\nare suggested on negative energies [11], these phenomena represent breakdown of all energy conditions. In cosmology, negative pressures are considered routinely since the advent of the concept of inflation [12, 13, 14] in the\neighties, and especially Dark Energy [15] in the last decade, after the discovery of the acceleration of the expansion of the universe [16, 17]. Negative\nenergy densities are occasionally considered elsewhere in General Relativity,\nas well (e.g. [18]). Therefore, while conditions should be imposed on T\u03bc\u03bd to\ndecide acceptability of metrics as solutions of Einstein's Equations, it is not\nvery clear what those conditions should be.\nYet, conditions on T\u03bc\u03bd are not sufficient; more primary is the correctness\nof the signature of the metric: Physics should locally be Minkowskian. The\nEinstein Equations not only do not guarantee correct signature, they even\nallow signature change \u2013 even some of the earliest static spherically symmetric\nsolutions, the Einstein static universe1 , Tolman IV and Tolman V [19], for\nexample, involve expressions that allow different signatures in different ranges\nof coordinates. Of course, in the Einstein static universe, the maximum\nvalue of the coordinate for correct signature is interpreted as the size of the\nuniverse, therefore the region in which the signature is wrong can be argued\nto be irrelevant.\nThe standard static spherically symmetric ansatz is\nds2 = \u2212B(r)dt2 + A(r)dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92\n\n(3)\n\nwhere d\u03a92 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 is the metric of a two-sphere. In terms of the\nmetric functions of this ansatz, the above requirement of correct signature\nbecomes\nA(r)B(r) > 0,\n(4)\na constraint not always explicitly stated in published solutions.\nThe requirement that the four-velocity of the source fluid should be real\nfurther constrains the signs of the metric functions for SSSPF solutions:\nWhen ansatz (3) is assumed, it is customary ([1], [2, Sect.16.1], or any General\nRelativity textbook) to take the fluid to be at rest, since the spacetime is\nstatic, i.e.\nu\u03bc = u0 \u03b40\u03bc\n(5)\n1\n\nFor the form of the solution and reference to the original publication, see [1]\n\n3\n\n\fThe normalization of the four-velocity gives\nCombining,\n\nu\u03bc u\u03bc = \u22121\n\n(6)\n\n\u2212 B(r)(u0)2 = \u22121\n\n(7)\n\ntherefore, if B(r) is negative, u0 becomes imaginary. This is obviously unacceptable, more so than any properties of the energy density or pressure\nof the fluid. Regions in which B(r) is negative should be excluded from the\nset of SSSPF solutions (One can also arrive at this conclusion by demanding\nthat the relevant Killing vector be timelike). This constraint is not always\nexplicitly stated either.\nIn recognition of this requirement, A(r) and B(r) are sometimes written as e\u03a6(r) and e\u03a8(r) , respectively (e.g. [20]), but when one carries out the\nintegrals necessary for solution of Einstein's Equations, one often gets logarithms, canceling the exponential (neglecting the requirement that logarithm\ncannot have a negative argument), and loses the positivity property of e\u03a6(r)\nand e\u03a8(r) . The best-known example of this is the Schwarzschild (exterior)\nsolution, where A(r) and B(r) are negative inside the horizon.\nOf course, it is this region that makes the Schwarzschild solution a black\nhole spacetime. But the Schwarzschild solution is a vacuum solution, there\nis no source fluid, therefore no four-velocity (that would become imaginary).\nThe same is true for the K\u00f6ttler1 (aka Schwarzschild-de Sitter) solution, if\nit is taken as a vacuum solution of Einstein's Equations with cosmological\nconstant \u039b; but if it is taken as a solution of the original Einstein Equations\nwith a \"static\" perfect fluid of equation of state p = \u2212\u03c1 as a source, it does\nhave the problem of imaginary four-velocity, except in the region between\nthe horizons. The identification and reinterpretation or cure of unacceptable\nparameter and/or coordinate ranges for SSSPF solutions in the literature\nwill be reported separately [21].\nHow can one interpret regions or solutions with negative A(r) and B(r),\nif not as SSSPF solutions? We turn to this question in the next section.\n\n2\n\nAlternatives: Dynamic and/or tachyonic\ncases\n\nThe requirement of positivity of A(r) and B(r) follows from (5), (6) and\nLorentzian signature of the metric. Therefore if we try to find meaning for\n4\n\n\fregions of negative A(r) and B(r), we must consider violations of (5) or (6).\nOf course, it is well-known that regions with negative A(r) and B(r) are not\nreally static (hence, the quotes in the title and abstract); calling a coordinate\nt does not make it timelike, the negative sign of the corresponding metric\nelement does.\nWe would like to first point out that (5) can be violated; that is, the\nnonzero component of the source four-velocity does not have to be u0 . The\nstandard assumption (5) that u0 is nonzero is usually imposed ad hoc, before applying Einstein's Equations; it is not the only one compatible with\nthem. To see this, consider the nonzero components of the Einstein tensor\ncorresponding to the standard ansatz (3) for the metric:\nG00 =\nG11 =\nG22 =\nG33 =\n\nB\n1\nrA\u2032\n1\n\u2212\n+\nr2\nA\nA2\n!\nrB \u2032\n1\n1\u2212A+\nr2\nB\n\"\n#\nr\nA\u2032 B \u2032 rA\u2032 B \u2032 rB \u20322 rB \u2032\u2032\n\u2212 +\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n2A\nA\nB\n2AB\n2B 2\nB\n2\nG22 sin \u03b8\n!\n\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere A(r) and B(r) are written as A and B for brevity, and prime denotes\nr-derivative. The last relation comes from spherical symmetry. Since both\ng\u03bc\u03bd and G\u03bc\u03bd are diagonal, Einstein Equations with (2) give\nu\u03bc u\u03bd = 0\n\nfor \u03bc 6= \u03bd\n\n(12)\n\nif \u03c1 + p is nonzero. We do not consider the special case \u03c1 + p = 0 since\nthis leads to the well-known K\u00f6ttler1 (SdS) solution. Otherwise, eq. (12)\nmeans that only one component of u\u03bc can be nonzero. Eq. (11) means\nT33 = T22 sin2 \u03b8, giving (u3 )2 = (u2 )2 sin2 \u03b8, therefore both u2 and u3 must be\nzero; but there is no reason why u1 should be.\nAlternatively, if (6) is violated, we must replace it with\nu\u03bc u\u03bc = +1\n\n(13)\n\nsince one can always normalize the four-velocity to \u00b11. Then the fluid is\ntachyonic.\nWhile tachyons would seem to violate causality, tachyonic fields have been\nput forward as one of the candidates for dark energy (see e.g. [22]). Also,\n5\n\n\fin [23] tachyonic particles are considered to provide a certain equation of\nstate. But there, the fluid is still at rest, therefore the fluid four-velocity\nstill obeys (5) and (6), it is the random motion of the fluid particles that\nis tachyonic. Here though, we are forced to consider the fluid itself having\ntachyonic property.\nSo we have a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix of possibilities: u0 or u1 may be nonzero,\nthe fluid may be normal or tachyonic. We label the cases with two letterabbreviations, the first showing the type of source (normal or tachyonic \u2013\nN or T), the second showing if the spacetime is static or dynamic (S or D).\nIncidentally, our ansatz cannot accomodate a null fluid, because \u2212B(r)(u0 )2\n[in the u0 nonzero case] or A(r)(u1 )2 [in the u1 nonzero case] cannot be zero\nwithout decreasing the dimensionality of the spacetime.\nWhatever the case, the Einstein Equations provide three equations for the\nfour unknowns A(r), B(r), \u03c1(r) and p(r), so some extra input is needed to\ndetermine a solution. This extra input can be in the form of a mathematically\nmotivated ansatz for one of A(r) and B(r), chosen so that the other one can\nbe easily found2 . But this will lead in general to complicated expressions\nfor \u03c1(r) and p(r), which may be difficult to interpret physically. A second,\nphysically motivated approach is to implement the properties of the desired\nsource fluid via a relation between its pressure and density, an equation of\nstate f (p, \u03c1) = 0. But this will lead to a nonlinear differential equation, in\ngeneral hard or impossible to solve analytically.\nWe now turn to the consideration of the four possible cases.\n\n2.1\n\nCase NS. u0 nonzero, fluid normal\n\nThis is the well-known case, included here for sake of comparison with the\nother cases. In this case we have\nT00 = \u03c1(r)B(r), T11 = p(r)A(r), T22 = p(r)r 2\n\n(14)\n\nso that Einstein's Equations turn into\n1\n1\nrA\u2032\n1\n\u2212\n+\nr2\nA\nA2\n2\n\n!\n\n= \u03ba\u03c1\n\n(15)\n\nActually, one can specify one of A(r) and B(r) arbitrarily, and get a differential\nequation for the other. In this sense, all possible solutions are expressible in terms of an\narbitrary function, but the resulting nonlinear differential equation is not always solvable\nanalytically.\n\n6\n\n\f1\n1\u2212A+\nr2\n\"\nA\u2032 B \u2032 rA\u2032 B \u2032 rB \u20322\n1\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n2\nA\nB\n2AB\n2B 2\n\nrB \u2032\n= \u03bapA\nB\n#\n1\nrB \u2032\u2032\n=\n(1 \u2212 A)\nB\nr\n!\n\n(16)\n(17)\n\nThe mathematically motivated approach [19] consists of putting an ansatz\nfor A(r) or B(r) into (17), solving for the other, then finding \u03c1(r) and p(r)\nvia (15) and (16). It is actually possible to change variables so that (17)\nbecomes linear in both dependent variables [2, Sect. 16.1], [24, 25].\nThe physically motivated approach [26] uses the integrability of the paranthesis in (15) to define a function F (r)\nF (r) = \u03ba\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1r 2 dr\n\n(18)\n\nwhich here is \u03ba/4\u03c0 times the \"mass function\" defined in the literature. Then\nB \u2032 /B is also expressed in terms of F via (16), and finally substitution for A,\nB and their derivatives in (17), gives\nr\nA =\n(19)\nr\u2212F\n\u03bapr 2 + 1 1\nB\u2032\n=\n\u2212\n(20)\nB\nr\u2212F\nr\n(\u03bapr 3 + F )\n\u2032\np = \u2212\n(\u03c1 + p)\n(21)\n2r(r \u2212 F )\nEq. (21) is the well-known Oppenheimer-Volkoff (OV) equation. In this\nequation now one would put p in terms of \u03c1 via an equation of state, then\n\u03c1 in terms of F \u2032 , via (18), eventually getting a differential equation for F .\nAfter solving for F , A and B would be found via (19) and (20), giving a\nmetric for that equation of state. One has to recall that solutions are only\nvalid for positive A(r) and B(r).\n\n2.2\n\nCase TD. u0 nonzero, fluid tachyonic\n\nThe possibility of tachyonic fluids was pointed out before as a feature of some\nsolutions with timelike radial coordinate [27], but here we argue that it is\ngeneric in two of the four cases compatible with the standard ansatz (3).\nBecause u20 = \u2212B now, in this case we have\nT00 = \u2212[\u03c1(r) + 2p(r)]B(r), T11 = p(r)A(r), T22 = p(r)r 2\n7\n\n(22)\n\n\fi.e. p also enters into the expression for T00 . Actually, it is not clear what\nmeaning \u03c1 and p would have for a tachyonic fluid, since the energy density \u03c1\nand pressure p for a perfect fluid are defined as those that would be measured\nby an observer moving with the fluid. Nevertheless, we may consider them\nto be the appropriate functions in a stress-energy-momentum tensor of the\nform (2).\nThe Einstein's Equations in this case become\n1\n1\nrA\u2032\n1\n\u2212\n+\n= \u2212\u03ba(\u03c1 + 2p)\nr2\nA\nA2\n!\n1\nrB \u2032\n= \u03bapA\n1\u2212A+\nr2\nB\n\"\n#\nA\u2032 B \u2032 rA\u2032 B \u2032 rB \u20322 rB \u2032\u2032\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u2212\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n(1 \u2212 A)\n2\n2\nA\nB\n2AB\n2B\nB\nr\n!\n\n(23)\n(24)\n(25)\n\ni.e. the second and third equations are the same as in case NS. If one follows\nthe mathematically motivated approach, formally the same functions for A(r)\nand B(r) can be used as in case NS, giving even the same p(r), but \u03c1(r) will\nbe different.\nIn the physically motivated approach we must use a different definition\nfor F (r):\nZ\n(\u03c1 + 2p)r 2 dr\n\nFT D (r) = \u2212\u03ba\n\n(26)\n\nand the equations (19)-(21) are replaced by\n\nr\nr \u2212 FT D\n\u03bapr 2 + 1 1\n=\n\u2212\nr \u2212 FT D\nr\n(\u03bapr 3 + FT D )\n=\n(\u03c1 + p)\n2r(r \u2212 FT D )\n\nA =\nB\u2032\nB\np\u2032\n\n(27)\n(28)\n(29)\n\nOne might call eq. (29) the tachyonic Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, and\ntreat it similarly. It looks similar to the corresponding eq. (21) of case NS,\napart from a sign; but this is misleading: The substitution of \u03c1 in terms of F \u2032\nvia (26) is different, possibly leading to a quite different differential equation\nfor a given equation of state. Alternatively, it can be brought into the same\nform by the substitution \u03c1\u0303 = \u2212(\u03c1 + 2p), but then the equation of state must\nbe changed to f (p, \u2212\u03c1\u0303 \u2212 2p) = 0.\n8\n\n\fAny solutions one gets for this case will only be valid for negative A(r)\nand B(r), therefore describe dynamic regions.\n\n2.3\n\nCase ND (KS). u1 nonzero, fluid normal\n\nIn this case, u21 = \u2212A, which also makes B negative by the signature requirement, and therefore this case also describes dynamic regions. By analogy\nwith the Schwarzschild vacuum solution, we may expect this case to be relevant in gravitational collapse situations in the region after horizon formation.\nFor this case we have\nT00 = \u2212p(r)B(r),\n\nT11 = \u2212\u03c1(r)A(r),\n\nT22 = p(r)r 2\n\n(30)\n\nThen, Einstein's Equations are\n1\n1\nrA\u2032\n1\n\u2212\n+\n= \u2212\u03bap\nr2\nA\nA2\n!\n1\nrB \u2032\n= \u2212\u03ba\u03c1A\n1\u2212A+\nr2\nB\n\"\n#\n1\n1 A\u2032 B \u2032 rA\u2032 B \u2032 rB \u20322 rB \u2032\u2032\n=\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n(1 \u2212 A)\n2\n2 A\nB\n2AB\n2B\nB\nr\n!\n\n(31)\n(32)\n(33)\n\nNote that although the only nonzero component of the fluid's four-velocity\nis u1 , the fluid is still moving along the timelike coordinate. So, the coordinates are comoving if we relabel r and t, and our case ND corresponds\nto the subcase Y \u2192 t, e2\u03bb \u2192 \u2212B(t), e2\u03bd \u2192 \u2212A(t) of the general non-static\nspherically symmetric perfect fluid equations, in the notation of [2, Sect.16.2].\nTherefore one can see that the rotation and acceleration, two of the quantities\nused to classify perfect fluid solutions [2, sect.15.6.1], vanish by construction\nin this case.\nShear, however, does not vanish: If we look for a shearfree solution here,\nwe are led to B(r) = Cr 2 . Then (33) gives A = 0, which is not acceptable.\nTherefore, all solutions given in Sect. 3.1 have shear. Expansion in general\nis nonzero as well, but a nonexpanding solution can also be found (Sect. 3.1,\nSol. ND5).\nThe general equations are difficult to solve for non-vanishing shear [2,\nSect.16.2], but one might hope this subcase to be easier, since it is covered by\n\n9\n\n\fthe well-treated ansatz (3). In fact, this case corresponds to the KantowskiSachs (KS) cosmological models ([2, Sect.15.6.5], [28] \u2013 since the range of the\nspacelike coordinate t is infinite).\nWe can derive an OV-like formalism for this case as well. Eq. (31) leads\nto the definition\nZ\nFN D (r) = \u2212\u03ba pr 2 dr\n(34)\nand we get\n\nr\nr \u2212 FN D\n1 \u2212 \u03ba\u03c1r 2 1\n=\n\u2212\nr \u2212 FN D\nr\n3FN D \u2212 4r + \u03ba\u03c1r 3\n(\u03c1 + p).\n=\n2r(r \u2212 FN D )\n\nA =\nB\u2032\nB\n\u03c1\u2032\n\n(35)\n(36)\n(37)\n\nEq. (37) is mathematically less similar to the OV equation than (29), and\nphysically it is totally different: Instead of change of pressure with depth, it\ngives change of density with time, since r in this case is timelike.\n\n2.4\n\nCase TS. u1 nonzero, fluid tachyonic\n\nOnce the possibility of a tachyonic fluid is considered, the case of a static\nspacetime supported by a such a fluid becomes inevitable; however, this case\nseems not to have been considered in the literature so far. Of course, the\nsame caveats about the meanings of \u03c1 and p apply as in case TD.\nNow, u21 = A, therefore B is also positive. We have\nT00 = \u2212p(r)B(r), T11 = (\u03c1(r) + 2p(r))A(r), T22 = p(r)r 2\n\n(38)\n\nThe Einstein's Equations in this case are\n1\nrA\u2032\n1\n1\n\u2212\n+\n= \u2212\u03bap\nr2\nA\nA2\n!\n1\nrB \u2032\n= \u03ba(\u03c1 + 2p)A\n1\u2212A+\nr2\nB\n\"\n#\n1 A\u2032 B \u2032 rA\u2032 B \u2032 rB \u20322 rB \u2032\u2032\n1\n=\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n(1 \u2212 A)\n2 A\nB\n2AB\n2B 2\nB\nr\n!\n\n10\n\n(39)\n(40)\n(41)\n\n\fi.e. the first and third equations are the same as in case ND.

As mentioned in the beginning of the previous section, an extra\nansatz is needed to solve the three equations. The simple mathematical\nans\u00e4tze we take are constancy3 of A(r) or B(r); the simple physical ans\u00e4tze\nare very simple equations of state, such as p = 0 (dust in cases NS and ND),\n\u03c1 = Const (\"incompressible\" fluid), maybe p = Const. We give the functions\nA(r), B(r), p(r) and \u03c1(r) in the order they are found. The restrictions on\nthe parameters and/or coordinate result from the requirement that A(r) and\nB(r) must be both positive or both negative, depending on the case.\n\n3.1\n\nCase ND (KS)\n\nWe start with this case since it is the most physically relevant nonstandard\ncase. We present five solutions (two with the mathematical approach, two\nwith the physical, one with mixed motivation). Because this case coincides\n3\n\n\u0010\n\n\u2032\n\nA\nA\n\nThe \u0011first\n\u0010 four \u2032 \u0011terms of the third equation in each \u2032 case can be written as\nB\u2032\n+ B\n1 \u00b1 2r BB , so assuming either AB = Const or BB = \u2213 2r would seem to be\n\nother possible simplifying ans\u00e4tze. However, the first leads to the K\u00f6ttler (SdS) solution1\nagain, while the second leads to A = Const, an ansatz we already use.\n\n11\n\n\fwith the Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes, and because of the simplicity of the\nstarting ans\u00e4tze; we do not expect these solutions to be original; and we\npoint out the first occurence of the solutions in the literature, when we can.\nSolution ND1.\nThe simplest mathematical ansatz for (33) is to take B = Const. It can\nbe any negative constant, but can be made equal to \u22121 by rescaling t.

The equation of state turns out to be familiar, p = \u03c1,\ndescribing a stiff fluid4 .\nSince r is timelike (and if u1 is taken to be negative), the increase of p\nand \u03c1 with decreasing r corresponds to compression as collapse progresses\nand their divergence at r = 0 corresponds to the future singularity resulting\nfrom the collapse. Of course, positive u1 will describe a spacetime region\nexpanding from a past singularity.\nA =\n\nSolution ND2.\nThe next simplest mathematical ansatz is to take A to be a negative\nconstant:\nA = \u2212|constant|\n\u221a\n\n(Ansatz)\n\n(50)\n\n\u221a\n\u2212 1\u2212A 2\n\nB = \u2212(C1 r 1\u2212A + C2 r\n)\n(51)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n(52)\np = \u2212 2 1\u2212\n\u03bar\nA\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1 (A \u2212 1 \u2212 2 1 \u2212 A)C1 r 1\u2212A + (A \u2212 1 + 2 1 \u2212 A)C2 r \u2212 1\u2212A\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(53)\n\u03c1 =\n\u03bar 2\nA(C1 r 1\u2212A + C2 r \u2212 1\u2212A )\n4\n\nAccording to footnote 17 of [29], this solution was first found in [30], which we were\nunable to access.\n\n12\n\n\fAgain, t can be rescaled to scale B(r), therefore only the ratio C2 /C1 is\nrelevant, but we left B(r) in this form to allow either constant to vanish.\nThere is no restriction on r, and again we get compression towards infinite\npressure at a future (or past) singularity.\nThe vanishing of either C1 or C2 leads to the proportional equation of\nstate p = w\u03c1, but the range \u2212 13 < w < 1 is excluded. There is also a special\nvalue of A, for which the density does\n\u221a not diverge at the singularity, unless\nC2 = 0.

The solution has no Schwarzschild limit, because its derivation excludes \u03c1 = 0.\nThis subcase can easily be found from (31) and (32) (upon which (33) needs to, and can\nbe verified). [28] also gives the Schwarzschild limit separately, as the \u01eb = 0 case.\n\n13\n\n\fOne of the earliest solutions in case NS is that of an \"incompressible\" fluid,\n\u03c1 = const [31].

What seems to be most interesting about this solution is that even an \"incompressible\" fluid can collapse\n(A given volume element shrinks along the \u03b8 and \u03c6 directions, but expands in\nthe \u2013now spacelike\u2013 t direction, conserving its volume). Pressure dominates\nover density near the singularity, one could even take \u03c1\u0304 \u2192 0, leaving only\npressure.

Since its A(r) is the\nsame as that of the Schwarzschild exterior solution, it is obtainable from that by the\ntransformation T2 of [25]. We can put any length into the root in the denominator of the\nargument of ln by redefining C1 . The choice was made for agreement with [1] or [25] while\nallowing C to be negative. Neither of [1] or [25] or [32] mention the r > C restriction,\nalthough [32] mentions a similar restriction for the solution named Kuch68 II in [1].\n\n19\n\n\fis valid for all r:\nSolution NS1* (K-O III):\n\u03c1 = 0\nA = 1\n\n(114)\n(115)\n\n4\n+ C2\nB = C3 (\u03bar 2 + C2 )2\np =\n\n\u03bar 2\n\n(116)\n(117)\n\nThis solution10 demonstrates, like solution ND5, that pressure gravitates:\nThere is no density to gravitate, and pressure must obviously be providing\nthe gravitational attraction against its own repulsion to keep the system\nstatic (In the \u03c1 \u2192 0 limit of Solution ND5, the pressure was negative). For\npositive central pressure p0 , the solution is regular, for negative p0 , there is\n2\na singularity at r = \u221a\u2212\u03bap\n.\n0\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work, we asked how far one can go with the ansatz (3), together with\nthe assumption that the source is a perfect fluid. That ansatz is usually used\nwhen looking for static spherically symmetric solutions.\nWe pointed out that the requirement of correct signature means that the\ntwo metric functions A(r) and B(r) in (3) must be both positive or both\nnegative. The natural followup question is how these two possibilities should\nbe interpreted. The answer to this question led to four cases, depending\non if the source four-velocity is directed along the t-coordinate or along the\nr-coordinate, and if the source four-velocity is timelike or spacelike. So we\nfound that apart from the standard case corresponding to static perfect fluid\nsolutions, the ansatz (3) can cover the Kantowski-Sachs class of solutions\n(after relabeling the radial and time coordinates) and two cases with tachyonic fluid as source. For each case, we wrote down the Einstein Equations,\nand derived Oppenheimer-Volkoff-like formalisms, that is, equations suited\n10\n\nAccording to [1], this solution was found in [33]; but actually [32] gives this as a special\ncase of Kuch68 I. Since its A(r) is the same as that of Minkowski metric, it is obtainable\nfrom that by the transformation T2 of [25]. Neither of [1] or [25] or [32] mention that this\nsolution is special because it is free of the coordinate range restriction.\n\n20\n\n\ffor finding solutions starting from an equation of state. We derived some\nsimple solutions as examples.\nSome papers pointed out before that in some dynamic spacetimes the\nsource fluid may be tachyonic, but here we found that this feature is generic\nin two of the four cases covered by ansatz (3). On the other hand, it seems\nnot to have been noticed before that once tachyonic source is considered,\nstatic spacetimes are also possible.\nThe four classes of solutions found here are physically quite distinct and\nshould be considered local solutions, especially when there is a coordinate\nrange restriction. We did not discuss in this work any possible patching together of solutions of different classes. It may seem that sometimes a solution\nhas regions of different classes by virtue of metric functions switching sign at\nsome r-value, which would form an apparent horizon. But then, the nature\n(normal vs. tachyonic) or the four-velocity (directed along t vs. directed\nalong r) of the source fluid would have to be wildly different on the two sides\nof the horizon (unless there is no source fluid, as in the Schwarzschild case).\nOn the other hand, a spherically symetric black hole is just such a spacetime, one which features a horizon at some r = R, where for r > R, r is\nspacelike and for r < R, r is timelike. In other words, it is a composite of a\nclass NS or TS spacetime (for r > R), and a class ND or TD spacetime (for\nr < R). Because these classes are physically quite distinct, spherically symmetric black hole solutions with perfect fluid source seem to be impossible if\none requires the metric elements and source fluid properties to be given by one\nfunction of r each, across the whole range of r. This is valid for all equations\nof state, dark energy (\u03c1 + 3p < 0), phantom energy (\u03c1 + p < 0) and negative\nenergy density (\u03c1 < 0) included; but is not valid for non-perfect-fluid cases\n(e.g. Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m), and of course, vacuum (Schwarzschild). So, a\nspherically symmetric perfect-fluid black hole would either have its spacetime\npatched together from solutions of different classes, or have a discontinuity\nof some property of the source fluid on the horizon, or be given by an ansatz\nmore complicated than (3).\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank to \u00d6.
