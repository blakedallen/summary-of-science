The images show the extended soft X-ray emission on the several\nhundreds of pc scale with better sensitivity than previously obtained. We show\nthat the hard X-ray component (> 2 keV) is spatially unresolved. The spectrum of the unresolved nuclear source may be described by a heavily absorbed\n(NH \u2243 3 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 ), hard power-law ( \u0393 \u2243 0.3) plus soft emission from either\na power-law (\u0393 \u2243 2.6) or a thermal (kT \u2243 0.6 keV) component. The flux of the\nhigh energy component has decreased from that observed by ASCA in 1993 and\nthe spectrum is much harder (\u0393 \u223c 0.3 in 2000 versus \u0393 \u2243 1.5 in 1993). The large\ndifference between the soft and hard spectral shapes does not favor the partial\ncovering or scattering model of the \"soft excess\". Instead, it is likely that the\nhard and soft nuclear components represent intrinsically different X-ray sources.\nThe stronger nuclear emission lines of those seen by the Chandra HETGS spectrum are detected. Spectra of the extended emission to almost 1 kpc NE and\nSW of the nucleus have also been obtained. The spectra of these regions may be\ndescribed by either thermal bremsstrahlung (kT \u2243 0.4 \u2212 0.7 keV) or power-law\n(\u0393 \u2243 2.5 \u2212 3.2) continua plus 3 emission lines. There is an excellent correlation\nbetween the extended X-ray and [O iii]\u03bb5007 line emissions. We discuss the\nnature of the extended X-ray emission. Because there is no extended electronscattered hard X-ray emission, an upper limit to the electron scattering column\ncan be obtained. This upper limit is much too low for the soft X-rays to be electron scattered nuclear radiation, unless the nucleus radiates soft X-rays much\nmore strongly towards the extended regions than towards Earth, a situation we\nconsider unlikely. We favor a picture in which the extended X-ray emitting gas is\nheated in situ by the nuclear radiation. Some of the X-rays may originate from\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\na hot phase which confines the warm ionized gas seen optically, although X-ray\nemission produced via photoionization by the nucleus is also likely. A faint, probably background, compact X-ray source lies \u2243 2.\u2032 2 from the nucleus to the SW,\napproximately along an extension of the extended SW X-ray and [OIII] emission.\nSubject headings: galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: individual (NGC 4151) \u2013 galaxies:\nnuclei \u2013 galaxies: ISM \u2013 galaxies: Seyfert \u2013 X-rays: galaxies\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBecause of its proximity (13.2 Mpc for H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , 1\u2032\u2032 = 64 pc), the Seyfert\n1.5 galaxy (Osterbrock & Koski 1976) NGC 4151 is one of the best studied among the class.\nX-ray observations show that NGC 4151 is a modest luminosity (L2\u221210keV \u2243 2 \u2212 20 \u00d7 1042\nerg s\u22121 ) active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a highly variable and hard continuum. There is\nevidence for a spectral-flux correlation above 2 keV (Perola et al. 1986; Yaqoob & Warwick\n1991; Yaqoob et al. 1993). The soft X-ray continuum of NGC 4151 is characterized by a\nprominent excess of X-ray emission above an extrapolation of the absorbed, higher energy\npower-law component to lower energies. This \"soft excess\" has been described in terms\nof partial covering, a warm absorber, scattered nuclear radiation and additional spectral\ncomponents (e.g. Holt et al. 1980; Yaqoob & Warwick 1991; Weaver et al. 1994a, b).\nEinstein and ROSAT observations identified extended soft X-ray emission that appears\nto be associated with ionized gas visible optically (Elvis, Briel & Henry 1983; Morse et\nal. 1995). This extended emission must account for at least part of the \"soft excess\". Ogle\net al. (2000) have recently obtained a 48 ks observation of NGC 4151 with the High-Energy\nTransmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory.\nTheir observation provided the first high resolution X-ray spectroscopy of NGC 4151 and\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nalso a zero-order image. Strong, narrow X-ray emission lines are seen in the spectrum.\nEvidence of both photoionized and collisionally ionized gas was found. However, their\nzero-order image has only modest signal-to-noise due to the limited transmission of the\ngratings.\nWe thought it worthwhile to obtain an exposure without the gratings in place in order\nto obtain a sensitive image of the extended emission. Given the dependence of the HETGS\nzero-order transmission on energy, our \u223c 30 ks direct image has higher sensitivity than the\nzero-order image by Ogle et al. (2000) for all energies below \u2243 6 keV.\nIn this paper, we present a Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS)\nobservation of NGC 4151. Observations are described in Section 2. Data analysis and\nresults are presented in Section 3, where we present the best X-ray image of NGC 4151\nto date and low resolution spectra of both the nucleus and extended regions. The X-ray\nimage is also compared with optical and radio images. Implications of the observation are\ndiscussed in Section 4. The detection of an off nuclear source about 2.\u2032 2 SW of the nucleus\nof NGC 4151 is described in the Appendix.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Effects of Pile Up\n\nThe observations of NGC 4151 were obtained in two phases. First, to evaluate the\neffects of pile up2 in the bright inner regions of NGC 4151, we took a preliminary 4.3 ks\nobservation on Dec. 4 1999 in so called \"alternating mode\", in which single exposures\nwith a 0.1 s frame time were alternated with two exposures with a 0.4 s frame time. The\n2\n\nFor bright sources, two or more photons may fall in the same pixel during one frame time\n\ninterval and the photons are then detected as a single event. This \"pile up\" effect results in\nan underestimated count rate and an incorrect spectrum.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nobservation showed that the nucleus is significantly piled up in the 0.4 s, but not in the 0.1 s,\nframe time observations. We also inferred that the bright inner regions of the galaxy would\nbe strongly affected by pile up in the planned long exposure, which would use the standard\n3.2 s frame time. We thus decided to obtain another, longer observation in \"alternating\nmode\", in addition to the long observation, to mitigate the effect of pile up in the inner\nregions. Therefore, the second phase of observations consisted of a \u2243 26 ks observation\nwith 3.2 s frame time and a \u2243 7 ks observation in \"alternating mode\", including both 0.1 s\nand 0.4 s exposures. Observations are summarized in Table 1. In the \u2243 26 ks observation,\nCCDs I2, I3, S1, S2, S3 and S4 were read out, though all of the detected X-ray emission\nfrom NGC 4151 is on S3. In both \"alternating mode \" exposures, only chip S3 was read\nout.\nThe fraction of bad grades (i.e. the ratio of the number of counts with ASCA grades\n1+5+7 [defined in the the Chandra Proposers' Observatory Guide, section 6.3] to the total\nnumber of counts) was found to be a good indicator of the degree of pile up in any given\npixel through comparison with the event rates in the different frame time observations.\nRegions with a large fraction (nominal value > 10%) of bad grades were considered to be\npiled-up. As already found in the preliminary observation, the 0.1 s frame time data were\nnot piled-up, with less than 6% of the grades in the brightest pixel being bad. The 0.4 s\nand 3.2 s frame time data were found to suffer from pile-up out to 1.\u2032\u2032 3 and 3\u2032\u2032 from the\nnucleus, respectively.\nAll of the analysis was initially done with the \"old\" response functions (\"fefs\"), and\ndata were reduced and analysed with ciao v1.1.5 and xspec v11.0.1. The observations\nwere screened for high background count rates and aspect errors by following the Chandra\nScience Threads. After we received the referee's report, new versions of response function\n(CALDB 2.7) were available. We reanalysed some of the data with these new response\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nfunctions and with the latest version of ciao \u2013 v2.1.2. In general, the change in derived\nparameters (such as absorbing column, photon index, bremsstrahlung temperature and\nemission line properties) were small. We did not reanalyse the 0.1 s frame time nuclear\nobservations with the new response functions because our results agree well with the\nconcurrent HETGS observations of the nucleus by Ogle et al. (2000), which have much\nhigher spectral resolution and are thus superior for detection of lines. We have, however,\nadded 0.2 keV to the line energies below 1 keV from the 0.1 s frame time observation since\nthere is a systematic error of this magnitude when using the old response functions. The\nresults presented for the 0.4s frame time nuclear observations and the 3.2s frame time\nobservations of the extended emission employed the new response functions.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nData Analysis and Results\nMorphology of X-ray emission\n\nThe soft X-ray (0.3\u20132.5 keV) images derived from the 0.1 s, 0.4 s and 3.2 s frame\ntime exposures are shown in Fig. 1. The \"hole\" at the position of the nucleus in the 3.2 s\nframe time image (Fig. 1c) is due to pile-up. The X-ray emission of NGC 4151 comprises\na bright unresolved nucleus and resolved extended regions. The south-west part of the\nextended emission extends as far as 14\u2032\u2032 ( \u2243 900 pc) from the nucleus along PA \u2243 233\u25e6 .\nThe north-east part of the extended emission extends to \u2248 11\u2032\u2032 (\u2243 700 pc) from the nucleus\nalong PA \u2243 75\u25e6 . The structure of the extended emission appears to be knotty rather than\nsmooth. A moderately bright, compact knot is clearly visible 6\u2032\u2032 (\u2243 380 pc) south-west of\nthe nucleus (Fig. 1c). A contour map representation of the extended emission is shown in\nFig. 2. Our images are in good agreement with the HETGS zero-order image obtained by\nOgle et al. (2000), but are more sensitive.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nThe 2\u20139 keV emission is not resolved in our observations, as can be seen by comparing\nthe radial profile of the observations in this band with the point spread function (PSF).\nIn Fig. 3a, the 5.5 keV model PSF without aspect error is plotted with the observed\nprofiles of the 2\u20139 keV emission. The 0.4\u20132 keV emission is, on the other hand, resolved\nalong the northeast-southwest direction, but is not (or is marginally) resolved along the\nnorthwest-southeast direction (Figs. 3b, c, d).\n\n3.2.\n\nX-ray Spectra of the Nuclear Region\n\nWe extracted spectra of the nucleus from a circular region with radius 3\u2032\u2032 in the 0.1 s\nand 0.4 s frame time observations. The total number of counts in the spectra are 2033\nand 10690 in the 0.1 s and 0.4 s frame times, respectively. For both observations, the\nbackground was taken from a region between two ellipses centered on the nucleus. The\nlarge ellipse had a semi-major axis of 17.\u2032\u2032 5 along PA 27\u25e6 (the column direction of CCD read\nout) and the smaller ellipse had a semi-major axis of 12.\u2032\u2032 5 in the direction of PA = 52\u25e6 . This\nrather oddly-shaped background region allowed all the background events to be extracted\nfrom the same CCD node.\nThe extracted spectra were grouped to a minimum of 20 and 30 counts per bin in the\n0.1 s and 0.4 s frame time data, respectively, to allow use of \u03c72 statistics. The spectral\nresolution of ACIS-S is \u223c 0.1 keV at 1 keV. For the bright nuclear region, the spectral\nresolution was not significantly degraded by this grouping. Because of the poor calibration\nat low energies and high background at high energies, channels below 0.3 keV and above 9\nkeV were ignored when modeling the spectra.\nThe emission from the brightest part of NGC 4151 originates in the nucleus and the\nunresolved emission line regions. At least two components are needed to describe the\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ncontinuum of the spectra from this region: a hard power law absorbed by an equivalent\nhydrogen column density of NH = (2 \u2212 3) \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 and a soft component that can be\nrepresented by either an absorbed power law or a thermal bremsstrahlung model. The\n0.1 s frame time spectra were fitted with these two component continuum models (Table 2)\nplus emission lines (Table 3). The model 2\u20139 keV flux is 4.8 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and the\nphoton index of the hard component \u0393 \u2243 0.32. The soft X-ray spectrum below 2 keV can\nbe described as a power law with photon index \u0393 \u223c 2.6 (Table 2, Fig. 4a). An alternative\ndescription in terms of thermal bremsstrahlung gives a temperature \u223c 0.57 keV (Fig 4b).\nHowever, the emission cannot be described by solar abundance, collisionally ionized hot\ngas. The best fit double power law parameters agree with those obtained in a concurrent\nHETGS observation (Ogle et al. 2000). Previous ASCA observations (Weaver et al. 1994b)\ngave a 2\u201310 keV flux of 11 \u2212 22 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , a photon index of \u0393 \u223c 1.5 and an\nabsorbing column of 2 \u2212 5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 . Weaver et al.'s absorbing column is about the\nsame as found in our observation and that of Ogle et al. (2000), while the photon index and\nflux from ASCA are significantly larger, indicating variability of the hard component. Our\nobservations suggest that the hard component of NGC 4151 is at its lowest state since 1984\n(EXOSAT observations yielded a low 2\u201310 keV flux of 3.6 \u00d7 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , [Pounds et\nal. 1986]). The very hard power law index found in the present observations with Chandra\nis unusual for a Seyfert 1 galaxy (Mushotzky 1984).\nLines were identified by adding narrow Gaussian features to the continuum model\nwith the goal of reducing the \u03c72 value of the fit. For all cases except the combined O vii\ntriplet, the intrinsic line width was set to zero. Both 0.1 s and 0.4 s frame time data were\nused. Though piled-up, the continuum of the 0.4 s frame time data between 0.4 to 7 keV\ncan still be described by a double power law model reasonably well (reduced \u03c72 = 180.8\nfor 179 degrees of freedom), with a rather hard photon index (\u0393 = \u22120.14+0.08\n\u22120.07 ) above 2\nkeV (Fig. 4c). This value of \u0393 is, however, too low as a result of the pile up. The low\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nspectral resolution of the ACIS instrument does not allow us to resolve all the lines seen\nin the grating observation (Ogle et al. 2000), but the stronger lines are detected. The best\nfits to the spectra are shown in Fig. 4, while the lines identified are listed in Tables 3 and\n4. The errors represent the 90% confidence range for a single interesting parameter. One\nfeature in the 0.4 s frame time spectrum, which probably results from the rapid change of\neffective area with energy near 2 keV, is also listed in Table 4 and labeled as \"artefact\".\nThe line fluxes from the 0.1 s frame time image agree well with those found in the HETGS\nobservation (Table 3). The line fluxes found from the 0.4 s frame time data tend to be\nlower than those obtained from the grating observation (see Table 4), probably as a result\nof pile up.\n\n3.3.\n\nX-ray Spectra of the Extended Emission\n\nFor the extended emission, we used the 3.2 s frame-time observation and extracted\nspectra from non-piled-up regions more than 3\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus to both NE and SW. The\nspectrum of the NE region was extracted from a 12.\u2032\u2032 7 \u00d7 8.\u2032\u2032 6 rectangle centered 7.\u2032\u2032 3 northeast\nof the nucleus (\u03b1 = 12h 10m 33s .0, \u03b4 = 39\u25e6 24\u2032 26.\u2032\u20327) with the longer side in position angle\n144\u25e6 . The spectrum of the SW region was extracted from a 12.\u2032\u2032 3\u00d77.\u2032\u2032 7 rectangle centered\n9.\u2032\u2032 2 southwest of the nucleus (\u03b1 = 12h 10m 31s .8, \u03b4 = 39\u25e6 24\u2032 17.\u2032\u2032 9 ) with the longer side\nin position angle 234\u25e6 (Fig. 5). The total number of counts in the NE and SW regions\nare 1120 and 1776, respectively. The background region was the same as in section 3.2.\nThe data were grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per bin in each region. The spectral\nresolution above 1 keV was significantly reduced by this grouping, especially for the NE\nregion. As before, channels below 0.3 and above 9 keV were ignored in spectral modelling.\nThe extended soft X-ray continuum emission can be modeled by a single bremsstrahlung\nor power law model with photo-electric absorption (Table 5). The emission observed above\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n2 keV is the unresolved nuclear emission which has been spread out by the mirror PSF\n(see section 3.1 and Fig. 3a), and are hence modeled with an absorbed power law with\nphoton index and absorbing column density identical to the nuclear value (section 3.2).\nThe absorbing column densities for the extended regions are not well constrained with the\npresent data and were \"frozen\" to the Galactic value (NH,Gal = 2.19 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22123 , Murphy\net al. 1996).\nIt would be interesting to examine the spectral index as a function of distance from the\nnucleus. However, the low count rate in the extended region makes it hard to obtain such\nspectra. To obtain a more qualitative picture, the \"hardness ratio\" of the soft X-ray band\n(defined as the ratio of background subtracted count rates in the 0.8\u20132.0 keV and 0.4\u20130.8\nkeV bands) as a function of distance from the nucleus has been obtained for the SW region\nfrom the 3.2 s frame time observation (Fig. 6). No significant change of hardness ratio is\nseen between 4\u2032\u2032 and 14\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus.\nSpectral lines were identified with the same technique as for the nucleus, and the\nresults are shown in Table 6. He-like O and Ne triplets are seen in both the SW and NE\nregions. The 0.72\u20130.74 keV feature observed in both regions could be a blend of lines of\nH-like O and radiative recombination continuum features of O vii. The observed spectra\nare compared with the continuum plus emission-line models in Fig. 7.\n\n3.4.\n\nComparison with observations at other wavelengths\n\nAn [O iii]\u03bb5007 contour map (P\u00e9rez-Fournon & Wilson 1990) is overlaid on the 3.2 s\nframe time 0.3\u20139 keV image in Fig 8. Extended X-ray emission is well correlated with the\nforbidden line emission to both NE and SW of the nucleus. The X-ray knot 6\u2032\u2032 (\u2243 380 pc)\nto the SW of nucleus is also seen in the [O iii] image, but with a \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 displacement.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nIn Fig. 9, a radio contour map from MERLIN observations (Mundell et al. 1995) is\noverlaid on our 0.1 s frame time Chandra image. The radio jet does not align with the soft\nX-ray extension. The angle between the two directions is \u223c 12\u25e6 .\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPartial covering and Scattering\n\nOne of the early suggestions for the origin of \"soft excess\" is the partial covering model\n(Holt et al. 1980), in which the continuum from the nucleus is covered by a \"clumpy\"\nabsorber. Previous studies show that a covering factor of 0.7 to 0.97 can account for all\nor a significant part of the \"soft excess\" (e.g. Weaver et al. 1994b, Warwick et al. 1995).\nHowever, in the two concurrent observations presented by Ogle et al. (2000) and this paper,\nthe photon indices for the hard and soft component were found to be \u2243 0.3 and \u2243 2.6,\nrespectively. The 0.1\u20132 keV flux from our observation is \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , which is\nclose to the lowest value seen in the ASCA observations of \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Weaver\net al. 1994b). This shows no significant variability in the soft component, in contrast to\nthe large variability in the hard component. These results makes a partial covering model\nunlikely. The same argument applies to the notion that the soft emission is Thomson\nscattered nuclear radiation, as already noted by Ogle et al. (2000). Instead, it is most likely\nthat the soft and hard components are intrinsically different X-ray sources.\nThe Thomson scattering model for the extended soft emission can be evaluated using\nthe soft- and hard-band profiles (Fig. 3). The hard-band profile is consistent with the mirror\nPSF, indicating there is no detectable intrinsically extended hard emission. This allows an\nupper limit to the fractional brightness of any hard nuclear emission which is Thomson\nscattered by the extended gas to be obtained. Because Thomson scattering is wavelength\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nindependent, this upper limit can be compared with the brightness of the extended, soft\nemission, expressed as a fraction of the soft nuclear emission. Using the 0.1 s frame time\nobservations in Fig. 3a, the 2\u20139 keV brightness within 1\u2032\u2032 of the nucleus is 0.12 cts pixel\u22121\ns\u22121 and the intrinsic 2\u20139 keV brightness between 4\u2032\u2032 and 5\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus is < 3.9 \u00d7 10\u22125\ncts pixel\u22121 s\u22121 , which represent an upper limit to the Thomson scattered hard radiation.\nThe corresponding numbers for the 0.4\u20132 keV emission are 0.13 cts pixel\u22121 s\u22121 for the\nnucleus and 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 cts pixel\u22121 s\u22121 between 4\u2032\u2032 and 5\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus in the SW region\n(Fig. 3c). Defining R \u2261(brightness between 4\u2032\u2032 to 5\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus)/(brightness within\n1\u2032\u2032 of the nucleus), we have R2\u22129\n\nkeV\n\n< 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 and R0.4\u22122\n\nkeV\n\n= 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 . The argument\n\nindicates that the extended soft emission is not Thomson scattered nuclear radiation as long\nas the intensity of the nuclear radiation radiated towards the putative scattering region is\nequal to that radiated towards Earth. The nuclear 2\u20139 keV radiation radiated towards the\nextended region may be stronger than that radiated in our direction because the latter is\nabsorbed. Such an effect decreases R2\u22129\nand R0.4\u22122\n\nkeV .\n\nkeV\n\nand increases the discrepancy between R2\u22129\n\nkeV\n\nIf the soft nuclear emission is absorbed by more than the low column we\n\nobtained by fitting the spectrum, it is possible that more soft radiation is radiated from\nthe nucleus towards the extended emission than towards us. This effect would reduce\nR0.4\u22122\n\nkeV\n\nand could potentially remove the discrepancy between R0.4\u22122\n\nkeV\n\nand R2\u22129\n\nkeV .\n\nWhile such cannot be ruled out, we consider it unlikely that the extended X-ray emission is\nThomson-scattered nuclear radiation.\n\n4.2.\n\nA Two Phase Model for the Extended X-ray Emission\n\nThe close association between the extended soft X-ray emission and the optical\nline emission in NGC 4151 suggests that the X-rays may arise from hot gas in pressure\nequilibrium with the extended narrow line region (ENLR) (Heckman & Balick 1983, Morse\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\net al. 1995). Gas of 106 \u2212 108 K is needed to confine the cooler gas clouds (Krolik, McKee\n& Tarter 1981, hereafter KMT; Krolik & Vrtilek 1984). Grating observations with the\nChandra HETGS show clear signatures of both photoionization and collisional ionization in\nthe X-ray emitting gas in the narrow line region. This indicates at least two phases exist\nin the plasma, one being hot (T \u2243 107 K) and collisionally ionized and the other warm\n(T \u2265 104 K) and photoionized (Ogle et al. 2000).\nPenston et al. (1990) derived emissivity-weighted estimates for the electron density\nand electron temperature in the SW optical ENLR of ne \u2243 220 cm\u22123 and Te \u2243 14130\nK, corresponding to a pressure of ne Te = 3.1 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 K. If the warm and hot clouds\nare in a rough pressure equilibrium, the density of the hot phase gas at a temperature of\nTh = 4.8 \u00d7 106 K (the bremsstrahlung temperature in the SW regions) should be nh \u2243 0.6\ncm\u22123 . Assuming the hot gas in the observed SW region uniformly fills a cylinder with a\nradius of 246 pc (\u2243 3.\u2032\u2032 85) and a height of 787 pc (\u2243 12.\u2032\u2032 3 ), the number density inferred\nfrom the bremsstrahlung description of the continuum of the SW radiation (see Table 5)\nis found to be nh \u2243 0.5 cm\u22123 . This is close to that needed for pressure balance. Using\nthe two power-law spectrum obtained from the 0.1 s frame time observation (section\n3.2) and adopting a spectral turn-over near 100 keV (Maisack et al. 1993), we obtain\na photoionizing luminosity L13.6\n\neV \u2212100 keV\n\n= 6.2 \u00d7 1043 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 . The ionization\n\nparameter (defined as \u039e \u2261 L/4\u03c0ckT nr 2 , KMT) for the hot gas measured at the center of\nthe SW region (r = 589 pc) is then 0.19. This combination of temperature and ionization\nparameter lies in the general area of the equilibrium curves of T versus \u039e calculated by\nKMT, although the equilibrium would be unstable. We note that the temperature derived\nfrom the bremsstrahlung model is much lower than the Compton temperature ( T \u2265 108 K,\nsee KMT). Given our low spectral resolution, we cannot tell whether the emission lines we\nsee from the extended region are collisionally ionized or photoionized. Ogle et al. (2000)\nidentified photoionized N vii, O vii, O viii, Ne ix and Ne x in the nuclear region from\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nthe narrowness of their radiative recombination continua. We see lines (some tentatively)\nof O vii, Oviii, Ne ix and Ne x from the extended regions (Table 6). If these species are\ncreated by photoionization, the ionizing parameter lies in the range 1.6 < log \u03be < 2.2, where\n\u03be \u2261 L/nr 2 (Kallman & McCray 1982). Using the ionization luminosity given above, and a\ntypical radius of 500 pc, these values of \u03be imply 0.2 < n < 0.7 cm\u22123 . The temperature\nof this gas would be \u2243 104.5 K according to Kallman & McCray (1982). Higher spectral\nresolution observations are needed to determine whether these lines are photoionized in\nsuch a warm gas or collisionally ionized in a hotter one.\n\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have obtained high sensitivity X-ray imaging-spectroscopy of NGC 4151 with the\nChandra X-ray Observatory . The soft X-ray emission (below 2 keV) is spatially resolved\nand extends as far as \u223c 900 pc to the SW and \u223c 700 pc to the NE of the nucleus. There\nis a close correlation between the extended soft X-ray and [O iii]\u03bb5007 emissions on the\nhundreds of pc scale. The 0.4\u20139 keV spectra of the nucleus and the extended regions to\nthe SW and NE of the nucleus have been obtained. The X-ray emission above 2 keV is\nspatially unresolved and is well described by an absorbed power law. The spectrum above 2\nkeV is harder and the flux lower than in observations made with ASCA in 1993 (Weaver et\nal. 1994b). The spectrum below 2 keV, on the other hand, is softer than found previously.\nThe large difference between the soft and hard spectral shapes does not favor the partial\ncovering or scattering model of the \"soft excess\". Instead, it is likely that the hard and soft\nnuclear components represent intrinsically different X-ray sources. We have shown that a\nmodel in which the extended emission is electron-scattered nuclear radiation is extremely\nimplausible. With the temperature (\u223c 4.8 \u00d7 106 K) inferred from a bremsstrahlung\ninterpretation of the X-ray spectrum, this hot gas is close to pressure equilibrium with\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nthe gas which radiates the optical line emission. While the extended emission is certainly\nthermal, our observations do not permit a clear distinction between a photoionized and\ncollisionally ionized gas. It is likely that both components are present, given the findings of\nOgle et al. (2000) for the nuclear region.\nWe thank Andy J. Young, Patrick L. Shopbell and David A. Smith for help with\nusing CIAO, XSPEC and WIP in analyzing the data. We are also grateful to Carole G.\nMundell for providing the MERLIN map in the numerical form. This research was partially\nsupported by NASA grant NAG 81027, by HST grant GO 7275, and by the Graduate\nSchool of the University of Maryland.\n\nAPPENDIX: An Off Nuclear X-ray Source\nAn unresolved X-ray source (\u03b1(2000.0) = 12h 10m 22s .37, \u03b4(2000.0) = 39\u25e6 23\u2032 17.\u2032\u2032 0) \u22432.\u2032 2\nSW of the nucleus (P.A. \u2243 241\u25e6) of NGC 4151 has been detected in the 3.2 s frame time\nobservation. The total counts within a 3\u2032\u2032 radius centered on the point source is 249. We\nobtained a spectrum of the source (Fig. 10). The spectrum can be well described by a\npower law absorbed by the Galactic column density (NH,Gal \u2243 2.19 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22123 , Murphy et\nal. 1996), with \u03c72 = 27.2 for 25 degrees of freedom. The best fit photon index \u0393 = 1.7+0.1\n\u22120.2\nand the model flux for the 0.3\u20135 keV energy range is 6.8 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 , corresponding\nto a luminosity of 1.4 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 , if the source is associated with NGC 4151. This\nsource lies approximately along the extension of the SW extended emission to larger radii.\nThere is a weak optical object nearby at the limit of the DSS with an estimated POSS-E\nmagnitude of \u2248 20. It is unclear whether this X-ray source is physically associated with\nNGC 4151. Similar coincidences have been seen in Mkn 3, Pictor A and NGC 4258, each of\nwhich has a faint, compact X-ray source close to the extension of the radio jets (Morse et\nal. 1995; Wilson, Young & Shopbell 2001; Wilson, Yang & Cecil 2001).\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nChandra Proposers' Observatory Guide Rev 3.0 2000 (Chandra X-ray Center, Cambridge,\nMA)\nElvis, M., Fassnacht, C., Wilson, A.

The narrow streak running NE\u2013SW (P.A. 27\u25e6 )\nacross the entire field, and visible in (a) and (b), is not real but a result of the CCD readout\nof the intense nuclear source. (a) 0.1 s frame time. The grey scale is proportional to the\nsquare root of the X-ray intensity, ranging from 0 cts pixel\u22121 (white) to 100 cts pixel\u22121\n(black). (b) 0.4 s frame time. The grey scale is proportional to the square root of the X-ray\nintensity, ranging from 0 cts pixel\u22121 (white) to 100 cts pixel\u22121 (black). (c) 3.2 s frame time,\nthe grey scale is proportional to the square root of the X-ray intensity, ranging from 0 cts\npixel\u22121 (white) to 71 cts pixel\u22121 (black). The \"hole\" at the nucleus in the 3.2 s frame time\nimage is not real but caused by pile up.\nFig. 2.- Contour plot of the 3.2 s frame time Chandra X-ray image of NGC 4151 in the\n0.3\u201310 keV range. The 11 contour levels range from 4 to 179 cts pixel\u22121 and are proportional\nto the square root of the X-ray intensity. The hole in the nucleus is not real but a result of\npile up.\nFig. 3.- Comparison of model point spread functions (PSFs) with observed radial profiles.\nIn each panel, the histogram is the model PSF from the PSF library and is normalized to\nthe 0.1 s frame time image peak, which is not piled-up. The points are the observed count\nrates per pixel which were obtained by averaging over an annulus or segments of an annular\nregion of radial extent 1\u2032\u2032 . Diamonds represent 0.1 s frame-time data, triangles represent\n0.4 s frame-time data and squares represent 3.2 s frame-time data. (a) The 2 \u2013 9 keV band.\nThe PSF was interpolated to 5.5 keV from the library of PSFs. The observed counts were\ntaken from complete, circular annuli and are consistent with the PSF, so the emission in\nthis band is unresolved (b) The 0.4 \u2013 2 keV band. The PSF was interpolated to 1.2 keV.\nThe observed counts were taken from two pie shaped regions each with opening angle 60\u25e6\nalong P.A. 144\u25e6 and P.A. 324\u25e6 , which are approximately perpendicular to the direction of\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nelongation of the extended emission (see Fig. 1). This diagram shows that the soft emission\nalong these directions is marginally resolved or unresolved. (c) Same energy range as (b).\nThe counts were taken from a pie shaped region toward the SW (P.A. 233\u25e6) with opening\nangle of 120\u25e6 . (d) Same as (c) but for the NE region (P.A. 54\u25e6 ), with opening angle 120\u25e6 .\nFig. 4.- X-ray spectra of the nucleus of NGC 4151, extracted from the 0.1 s and 0.4 s frametime data. The upper panels show the data points with error bars (crosses), with the model\nfolded through the instrument response (solid line). The lower panels show the \u03c7 residuals\nfrom this fit. The parameters of these models are listed in Tables 2, 3 and 4. Note that the\ncalibration is uncertain below 0.50 keV and degrades rapidly below 0.45 keV. (a) The 0.1 s\nframe time data with a model comprising two power law continua plus emission lines (Tables\n2 and 3). (b) The 0.1 s frame time data with a model comprising a bremsstrahlung and a\npower-law continuum, plus emission lines (Tables 2 and 3). (c) The 0.4 s frame time data\nwith a model comprising a bremsstrahlung and a power-law continuum, plus emission lines\n(Table 4). The channels above 7 keV are ignored in the fit to reduce the effect of \"pile-up\".\nFig. 5.- The rectangles defining the SW and NE regions are shown superposed on a grey\nscale representation of the 3.2 s frame-time 0.3 \u2013 10 keV image.

The model is two power laws plus emission lines. (c) The NE region. The model\nis a bremsstrahlung plus a power law plus emission lines. (d) The NE region. The model is\ntwo power laws plus emission lines.\nFig. 8.- A superposition of an [OIII] \u03bb5007 image (contours, from P\u00e9rez-Fournon & Wilson\n1990) on the 3.2 s frame time X-ray image. The grey scale is proportional to the square\nroot of the X-ray intensity, ranging from 1 cts pixel\u22121 (white) to 40 cts pixel\u22121 (black). The\ncontour levels for the optical image are drawn at 0.07%, 0.15%, 0.3%, 0.6%, 0.12%, 2.5%,\n5%, 10%, 20% and 80% of the peak.\nFig. 9.- A superposition of a MERLIN radio continuum image at 21 cm (contours, from\nMundell et al. 1995) on the 0.1 s frame time grey scale X-ray image. The grey scale is\nproportional to the square root of the X-ray intensity, ranging from 0 cts pixel\u22121 (white) to\na peak intensity of 314 cts pixel\u22121 (black). The contour levels of the radio image are drawn\nat 1.5%, 3%, 5%, 12%, 20%, 75% of the peak.\nFig. 10.- X-ray spectrum of the off nuclear source described in the Appendix. The spectrum\nis extracted from the 3.2 s frame time observation. The upper panel shows the data points\nwith error bars (crosses) and the model folded through the instrument response (solid line).\nThe lower panel shows the \u03c7 residuals to this fit. The model is an absorbed power-law.\n\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\fN\n\nNE\n\nE\n\npiled up\n\nSW\n\n5 arc sec\n\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f"}
