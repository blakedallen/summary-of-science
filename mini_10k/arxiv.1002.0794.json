The thermal properties of the gas of photons are well-known. One\nof them, the Stefan-Boltzmann law [2] gives the value of the energy flux in terms of the\ntemperature of the emitter through a power law \u03c3T 4 .\nHowever, in many instances frequently found in nano-systems, the radiation is not in\nequilibrium due to the presence of thermal sources or temperature gradients. This is what\nhappens in nanostructures such as solar cells and thermophotovoltaic devices [3, 4], even in\ncancer therapies [5, 6], just to cite some exemples. In these situations, the classical scheme\nis no longer applicable and it then becomes necessary to employ a nonequilibrium theory. A\nfirst attempt to describe non-equilibrium radiation could be performed via nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics [8]. Nevertheless, some of the laws governing the behavior of thermal\nradiation are non-linear laws whose derivation is beyond the scope of this theory which\nprovides only linear relationships between fluxes and forces.\nIn this article, we will show that this limitation can be overcome if mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics [9, 10] is used. This can be done by performing a description in\nterms of an internal variable [11, 12] \u2013the momenta of the photons\u2013 and by assuming local\nequilibrium in phase\u2013space. In this way it is possible to analyze the underlying activated\nprocess for which photons are emitted. The photon energy current does obtained leads to\nthe nonequilibrium Stefan-Boltzmann law.\nThis article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we study the photon gas outside equilibrium. Starting from the Gibbs entropy postulate, we derive the entropy production and\nfrom this the current of photons. In Section 3, we analyze the steady state obtained when\nphotons are emitted by two bodies at two different temperatures. By using mesoscopic\nnonequilibrium thermodynamics we derive the equivalent to the Stefan-Boltzmann law in\nthis nonequilibrium situation. In the conclusion, we discuss some perspectives of the results\nobtained.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nTHE NONEQUILIBRIUM PHOTON GAS\n\nLet us consider a gas of photons distributed through the law n(\u0393,t) which is the probability density defined in the single-particle phase-space \u0393 = (p,x), where p, x are the\nmomentum and position of a photon, respectively. According to the principle of the conservation of probability, we assume that n(\u0393,t) satisfy the continuity equation\n\u2202\n\u2202\nn(\u0393,t) = \u2212\n* J (\u0393,t)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u0393\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2202/\u2202\u0393 = (\u2202/\u2202p, \u2207), \u2207 = \u2202/\u2202x. The continuity equation (1) defines the probability\ncurrent J (\u0393,t) = (Jx , Jp ) which must be determined by means of the methods of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.\nAccording to the Gibbs entropy postulate, our thermodynamic analysis of the nonequilibrium gas is based in the assumption of the density functional\nZ\nn(\u0393,t)\nd\u0393+S0\nS(t) = \u2212kB n(\u0393,t) ln\nneq (\u0393)\n\n(2)\n\nas the nonequilibrium entropy of the system [8\u201310]. Here, S0 is the equilibrium entropy of\nthe gas plus the thermal bath and neq (\u0393) is the equilibrium probability density function.\nBy taking variations of Eq. (2) we obtain\n\n\u03b4S = \u2212kB\n\nZ\n\n\u03b4n(\u0393,t) ln\n\nn(\u0393,t)\nd\u0393 ,\nneq (\u0393)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere once one introduces the nonequilibrium chemical potential\n\u03bc(\u0393,t) = kB T ln\nEq. (3) can be written\n\u03b4S = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nn(\u0393,t)\n,\nneq (\u0393)\n\n\u03bc(\u0393,t)\n\u03b4n(\u0393,t)d\u0393 .\nT\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nHere, Eq. (5) which is the Gibb's equation of thermodynamics formulated in the phasespace, illustrates the physical meaning of the nonequilibrium chemical potential (4). Since\n\u2212T \u03b4S = \u03b4F , with F the nonequilibrium free energy, Eq. (5) leads to\n\u03b4F =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc(\u0393,t)\u03b4n(\u0393,t)d\u0393 .\n\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fOn the other hand, the equilibrium chemical potential of photons is zero, thus no reference\nvalue \u03bc0 is needed in Eq. (4). From Eqs. (1) and (5) we obtain the entropy production\nZ\n\u2202S\n\u2202 \u03bc(\u0393,t)\n= \u2212 J (\u0393,t) *\nd\u0393 ,\n(7)\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u0393 T\nas the product of a thermodynamics current and the conjugated thermodynamic force\n\u2202/\u2202\u0393(\u03bc(\u0393,t)/T ) [8]. As usual in nonequilibrium thermodynamic [8], from Eq. (7) we derive\nthe phenomenological law\nJ (\u0393,t) = \u2212L(\u0393) *\n\n\u2202 \u03bc(\u0393,t)\n,\n\u2202\u0393 T\n\n(8)\n\nwhere L(\u0393) is the matrix of phenomenological coefficients. Hence, Eq. (8) enables us to\nwrite the entropy production Eq. (7) as a bilinear form\nZ\n\u2202S\n\u2202 \u03bc(\u0393,t)\n\u2202 \u03bc(\u0393,t)\n=\n* L(\u0393) *\nd\u0393 .\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u0393 T\n\u2202\u0393 T\n\n(9)\n\nIn terms of the diffusion matrix D(\u0393) = kB M, where M(\u0393) = L/n is the mobility, Eq. (8)\ncan be written in a more convenient form\nJ (\u0393,t) = \u2212D(\u0393) *\n\n\u2202\nn(\u0393,t),\n\u2202\u0393\n\n(10)\n\nwhich constitutes the Fick's law of diffusion [14] formulated in the single-particle phasespace.\n\nIII.\n\nSTATIONARY\n\nSTATE\n\nAND\n\nTHE\n\nNONEQUILIBRIUM\n\nSTEFAN-\n\nBOLTZMANN LAW\n\nIn this section we will study the heat exchange by thermal radiation between two bodies at\ndifferent temperatures. This process comes into play in nanostructures such as solar cells and\nthermophotovoltaic devices, just to cite some exemples. Applications of thermophotovoltaic\ndevices range from hybrid electric vehicles to power sources for microelectronic systems [3].\nTherefore, as mentioned, the recent developments of nanotechnology made the study of heat\nexchange by thermal radiation an object of growing interest [15].\nHence, to undertake this study, we assume that the dynamics of the photons is the result\nof two simultaneous processes: emission and absortion of cold photons at TC and emission\nand absorption of hot photons at TH , this is illustrated by the Figure (see Fig. (1))\n\n4\n\n\fFIG. 1: (Color online) Schematic illustration of the radiation exchanged between two materials\nmaintained at different temperatures, TH and TC , separated by a distance L.\n\nSince the photons do not interact among themselves we assume that the system is homogeneous, \u0393 \u2212\u2192 p, and the diffusion matrix reduces to a scalar D(\u0393), the diffusion coefficient.\nAdditionally, if there are only hot and cold photons\nbC (t)\u03b4(p \u2212 pC ) + J\nbH (t)\u03b4(p \u2212 pH ) ,\nJ (p,t) = J\n\n(11)\n\ni.e. the system reaches a state of quasi equilibrium. Thus, integration of Eq. (10) taking\ninto account Eq. (11) leads to\nJbC (t) JbH (t)\n+\n= \u2212 [n(pC ,t) \u2212 n(pH ,t)] ,\nDC\nDH\n\n(12)\n\nwith J(t) = u * J(t) and u is the unit vector normal to the walls. Whence, introducing the\nnet current J(t) defined through\nJbC (t) JbH (t)\nJ(t)\n=\n+\n,\naDC DH\nDC\nDH\n\n(13)\n\nor equivalently\nJ(t) = aDH JbC (t) + aDC JbH (t) ,\n5\n\n(14)\n\n\fwe can rewrite Eq. (12)\nJ(t) = \u2212aDC DH [n(pC ,t) \u2212 n(pH ,t)] ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere a is an effective parameter accounting for the dimensionality. Here, term by term\ncomparison of Eqs. (14) and (15) leads to the identification\n\nTherefore,\n\nJbC (t) = \u2212aDC n(pC ,t),\n\n(16)\n\nJbH (t) = aDH n(pH ,t) .\n\n(17)\n\n\u2212 DH JbC (t) = DH DC n(pC ,t)\n\n(18)\n\nrepresents the fraction of photons absorved at the hot wall from the fraction JC (t) of photons\nemited at the cold wall. In the same way,\nDC JbH (t) = DC DH n(pH ,t)\n\n(19)\n\nrepresents the fraction of photons absorved at the cold wall from the fraction JH (t) of\nphotons emited at the hot wall.\nTo better illustrate the physics under the nonequilibrium process involving the photons, we\nintroduce the affinity\nA = \u03bcC \u2212 \u03bcH ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03bcC = \u03bc(pC ,t) and \u03bcH = \u03bc(pH ,t), which with the help of Eq. (4), enables us to rewrite\nEq. (15) as [11]\nJ(t) = aDC DH exp\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bcH\nkB TH\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u0013\nA\n\u03bcH\n1\n1\n1 \u2212 exp\nexp\n\u2212\n.\nkB TH\nkB TC\nTH\n\n(21)\n\nThis result shows the nonlinearity inherent to the process involving the radiation since this\ncorresponds to a heat current which does not satisfies the Fourier law.\nIn general, the diffusion coefficient might depend on the frequency. However, one can\nintroduce a cut-off limit, \u03bbT = c\u0127/kB T , the thermal wavelength of a photon, which marks\nthis dependence. So, for length scales L \u226b \u03bbT (i.e. high frequencies) we can treat the\nphotons as point particles, hence in this case we deal with the free diffusion of point particles\nfor which the diffusion coefficient is constant. On the other hand, when L . \u03bbT (i.e. low\n6\n\n\ffrequencies) we deal with the problem of cage-diffusion [16], therefore the diffusion coefficient\nmust depend on the ratio \u03bbT /L or equivalently on the frequency [17, 18].\nIn the stationary state, the current of photons per unit of volume in phase-space is given\nby\nJst (\u03c9) = aDC (\u03c9)DH (\u03c9) [n(\u03c9, TH ) \u2212 n(\u03c9, TC )] ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere\nn(\u03c9, T ) = 2\n\nN(\u03c9, T )\n,\nh3\n\n(23)\n\nwith h being the Planck constant and N(\u03c9, T ) the averaged number of particles in a elementary cell of the phase-space given by the Planck distribution [2]\nN(\u03c9, T ) =\n\n1\n.\nexp (\u0127\u03c9/kT ) \u2212 1\n\n(24)\n\nIn Eq. (23) the factor 2 comes from the polarization of the photons. Here, the diffusion\nconstant plays the role of the effective cross section.\nBy multiplying Eq. (22) by \u0127\u03c9 \u2013the energy of a photon\u2013 and integrating in momentum\nspace we obtain the heat current\nQ=\n\nZ\n\n\u0127\u03c9Jst(\u03c9)dp,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere p = (\u0127\u03c9/c) \u03a9p . In the case L \u226b \u03bbT , and in an ideal situation, we can take\nDC = DH = D = 1. Thus, with Eq. (23), Eq. (25) leads to\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0127\nQ = 3 3 d\u03c9d\u03a9p\u03c9 3 Jst (\u03c9) = \u03c3 TH4 \u2212 TC4 ,\n4\u03c0 c\n\n(26)\n\n4\nwhere we have taken a = c/4, with c the velocity of the radiation and \u03c3 = \u03c0 2 kB\n/60\u01273 c2\n\nbeing the Stefan constantn [2]. At equilibrium TH = TC , therefore Q = 0.\nFor a s-dimensional system, the phase-space is made up of s coordinates and s conjugated\nmomenta. Hence, the volume of an elementary cell of this phase-space is hs and now\n\nn(\u03c9, T ) = 2\n\nN(\u03c9, T )\n.\nhs\n\n(27)\n\nIn this case, by integrating over a hypersphere in momentum-space and assuming that now\na is a function of s, a(s), it this possible to obtain\nQ = \u03c3(s) THs+1 \u2212 TCs+1\nwhich generalizes results previously derived in Ref.

In the framework of mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics based on the Gibb's entropy postulate, we have obtained the Gibb's\nequation of thermodynamics which here, describes the local equilibrium in the phase-space.\nThen, by means of the usual procedure of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, from the Gibb's\nequation we have derived the Fick's law for the diffusion of photons valid at short time\nscales.\nThe exchange of energy is assumed to be due to activated processes related to reaction rate\ncurrents which are derivable in the framework of our thermodynamic theory. These currents\nprovide us with the rate of absortion and emission of photons. Since in the stationary state\nboth hot and cold photons are in local equilibrium, their rates are proportional to the Planck\ndistribution. Finally, the net current of heat is given through a balance of these rate currents\nafter integration over frequencies, constituting the nonequilibrium Stefan-Boltzmann law.\nSystems outside equilibrium exhibit peculiar features not observed in an equilibrium\nstate [7]. The results obtained show how non-equilibirum phenomena taking place in gases\ncomposed of quasi-particles, governed by non-linear laws, can be analyzed by means of the\nmethods of nonequilibrium thermodynamics applied to the mesoscale. These methods have\nbeen shown to be very useful in the study of activated processes of different natures [19, 20].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the DGiCYT of Spanish Government under Grant No.\nFIS2008-04386, and by Brazilian Research Foundation: CNPQ.\n\n[1] Planck, M., Treatise on Thermodynamics, Dover, New York, 1945.\n[2] Pathria, R.K., Statistical mechanics, Pergamon Press, Oxford,1988.\n\n8\n\n\f[3] Zhang, Z., Nano/Microscale Heat Transfer, Nanoscience and Technology Series, McGraw-Hill,\nNew York, 2007.\n[4] De Vos, A., Thermodynamics of Solar Energy Conversion, WILEY\u2013VCH Verlag, 2008.\n[5] Rabin, Y., Nanotechnology Essays, EurekAlert\u2013Nanotechnology In Context, August 2002.\n[6] Fortin, J.-P., Gazeau, F., Wilhelm, C., Intracellular heating of living cells through N\u00e9el relaxation of magnetic nanoparticles, Eur.
