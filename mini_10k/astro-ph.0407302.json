We extend light curves of variable objects which were detected in 3-year baseline in the OGLE-II variable star catalog to 4th year. We search\nfor objects which are faint (16 < I0 < 18.5) and slowly variable during 4 years in\nthis catalog by using the variogram/structure function. Finding the QSOs in such\nstellar-crowded and high extinction fields is challenging, but should be useful for the\nastrometric reference frame. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are required to confirm these QSO candidates. Follow-up observations are being prepared for four of these\nfields (BUL SC1, 2, 32 and 45).

High spatial resolution of the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory limited source confusion problems for the Xray based searches. Dobrzycki et al. (2002) found several\nquasars behind the LMC and SMC, including four quasars\nbehind the dense parts of the LMC bar by spectroscopic\nobservations of the OGLE optical counterpart of Chandra\nX-ray sources.\nAnother\nefficient\nmethod\nof\nsearching\nfor\nquasars is based on optical variability (Hawkins\n1983; Veron & Hawkins 1995; or more recently\n\nBrunzendorf & Meusinger 2002; Rengstorf et al. 2004).\nSeveral gravitational microlensing survey groups have been\nmonitoring hundreds of millions of stars toward dense\nregions such as the Galactic centre, the Galactic disc\nand/or the Magellanic clouds (EROS: Derue 1999; OGLE:\nUdalski et al. 2003; MACHO: Alcock et al. 2000; MOA:\nBond et al. 2001). Eyer (2002) searched QSO candidates\ntowards the Magellanic clouds via variability by using\nthe second phase of the OGLE experiment 1 (OGLE-II;\nUdalski, Kubiak & Szyma\u0144ski 1997) variable star catalog\n(Zebru\u0144 et al. 2001). Dobrzycki et al. (2003) did follow-up\nspectroscopic observations of 12 of these quasar candidates\nin the Small Magellanic Cloud fields and confirmed 5 as\nQSOs. They also found the color information is useful to\nselect QSOs. Geha et al. (2003) found about 47 QSOs\n1\n\nsee\nhttp://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~ogle\nhttp://bulge.princeton.edu/~ogle\n\nor\n\n\f2\n\nT. Sumi et al.\n\nbehind the Magellanic Clouds, by selecting the candidates\nvia variability in the MACHO database and follow-up\nspectroscopic observations.\nIn this work, following Eyer (2002), we search for\nQSO candidates via variability in OGLE-II Galactic Bulge\nfields (Udalski et al. 2002). Up to now, no QSOs have been\nfound in these regions. The main motivation for this study\nis that quasars may provide background sources which\nfix the astrometric reference frame. Kinematic studies of\nstars (Sumi, Eyer & Wozniak 2003; Sumi et al. 2004) would\ngreatly benefit from having absolute astrometry. These\nQSOs will also be useful for the future astrometric program,\nsuch as Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) and GAIA.\nHowever, finding QSOs in these fields is more challenging\nthan in Magellanic Cloud fields because of the higher stellar\ndensity and higher extinction.\nIn \u00a7 2 we describe the data. We select QSO candidates\nin \u00a7 3. Discussion and conclusion are given in \u00a7 4.\n\n2\n\nDATA\n\nWe use the V I photometric maps of OGLE-II fields\n(Udalski et al. 2002), which contain V I photometry and astrometry of \u223c 30 million stars in the 49 Galactic Bulge fields.\nPositions of these fields (BUL SC1 \u223c 49) can be found in\nUdalski et al. (2002). We do not use BUL SC44 in this work\nbecause its extinction is too high (AV > 4). The photometry\nis the mean photometry from a few hundred measurements\nin the I-band and several measurements in V -band collected\nbetween 1997 and 2000. Accuracy of the zero points of the\nphotometry is about 0.04 mag. A single 2048 \u00d7 8192 pixel\nframe covers an area of 0.24 \u00d7 0.95 deg.2 with a pixel size\nof 0.417 arcsec. Details of the instrumentation setup can be\nfound in Udalski, Kubiak & Szyma\u0144ski (1997).\nWe also use the light curves of objects in the OGLE-II\nGalactic Bulge variable star catalogue (Wo\u017aniak et al. 2002)\nwhich contain 213,965 variable objects. The variable object detection and the photometry have been done by using the Difference Image analysis (DIA) (Alard & Lupton\n1998; Alard 2000; Wo\u017aniak 2000) for the data collected during the first 3 years of the OGLE-II project. We extended\nthe light curves to the fourth year (2000) using the method\nof Wo\u017aniak et al. (2002); however new variable object detection is not attempted for the additional data.\n\n3\n\nQSO CANDIDATES SELECTION\n\nWe cross-referenced 213,965 variable objects in the variable\nstar catalogue (Wo\u017aniak et al. 2002) with objects in OGLEII photometric maps (Udalski et al. 2002), which are well\ncalibrated, and extracted their V and I magnitudes. 205,473\nof them have counterparts in the photometric maps. We use\nthese magnitudes in the following analysis.\nWe chose 30,219 objects which are fainter than I0 = 16\nmag, where I0 is the I-band magnitude after extinctions\nare corrected by using the extinction map in these fields\n(Sumi 2004). We show the Colour Magnitude Diagram\n(CMD) of one of these fields in Fig. 2. The detection limit\nin the variable star catalogue is about I = 19.5 mag,\nwhich corresponds to extinction corrected magnitudes of\n\n17 \u223c 18.5 < I0 , depending on the level of extinction in each\nfield. The number density of QSO brighter than i = 19.1 mag\nis 9.6/deg.2 (Vanden Berk et al 2004), where the Sloan i is\nalmost similar to the OGLE I. So in this magnitude range\nwe expect 20 \u223c 30 QSOs in our 48 fields covering \u223c 11\nsquare degrees taking the extinction into account.\nThere are many artifacts in the variable star catalogue.\nThe light curves of objects around bright stars are affected\nby the long wings of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of\nthat bright star, and then they resemble that star's variability. Even around a star with constant brightness, the\nwings can affect nearby faint stars due to variations of seeing and the PSF. This effect causes the systematic gap in\nthe brightness of faint stars around a bright star between\nin 1998 and in 1999 due to the re-aluminization of the mirror, which changed the size and/or shape of the PSF. Such\nlight curves with a systematic gap are one of the major contaminations in our QSO selection. So we masked the stars,\naround the bright stars including saturated stars. Saturated\nstars are not in the star catalogue. To deal with them we\ncounted the number of continuous pixels, Nsat whose ADU\nvalue is larger than 12,000 on the OGLE-II template image.\nThen we masked the area\n\u221a centered at these pixels with a\nradius of rad = 4 + 5 \u00d7 Nsat . This removed 62% of variable\nstars though only 11% of the area in total is masked. At this\npoint, 11,535 light curves still remain.\nFollowing Eyer (2002), we use the variogram/structure\nfunction (Eyer & Genton 1999, Hughes, Aller, & Aller\n1992) to find objects with increasing variability on longer\ntime-scales. We measure the slope of the variogram as\nfollows. For all possible pairs of measurements, differences\nof times, hi,j = tj \u2212 ti and square of difference of magnitudes, (Ij \u2212 Ii )2 are computed. For a given bin of logh, the\nmedian of (Ij \u2212 Ii )2 is estimated, and is noted as V ar(h).\nThis gives a spread of the variation of I in this time-scale.\nWe bin logh for three parts divided by 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, then\nmeasure the slope, Svar = dV ar(h)/dlogh. The larger Svar ,\nthe larger the variability on larger time-scales. We rejected\nlight curves with Svar < 0.09, which is a slightly more\nconservative value than the 0.1 used in Eyer (2002). We\nsearch the periodicity in the light curves by using the AoV\nalgorithm (Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1989). Then we reject\nthe light curves in which strong periodicity is detected with\nthe AoV periodogram of larger than 50. This value was\nchosen empirically. We show two sample light curves and\nV ar(h) as a function of logh in Fig. 1. After this procedure,\n3,201 light curves remain.\nThe remaining light curves, were inspected by eye. First\nwe rejected apparent periodic and semi-periodic variables\nwhich couldn't be rejected by the previous procedure. After\nthis 500 light curves are left.\nThe main contamination after this selection are high\nproper motion objects and artifacts around bright Variable\nstars. We rejected them as follows.\nWhen an object moves from the position at the template image, DIA produces a pair of positive and negative\nresiduals on the subtracted image. The flux of these residuals\nincreases as a function of the displacement of positions of the\nobjects (Eyer & Wo\u017aniak 2001; Soszynski et al. 2002). We\ncross-referenced with the proper motion catalog (Sumi et al.\n2004) to check if they have high proper motion or if there is\na high proper motion object nearby. Even if its proper mo-\n\n\fVariability-selected QSO candidates in OGLE-II Galactic Bulge fields\n\n3\n\nFigure 2.

In the second and\n4th panels, dashed lines represent the best fit for the three points\n(logh = 2, 2.5, 3) whose slopes Svar are written in the panels.\n\ntion is not so high, a bright nearby star can produces a pair\nof significant residuals and constantly increase or decrease\nthe brightness of the nearby faint stars. To reject them we\nlooked at the light curves of all neighboring stars in OGLEII photometric maps within 20 pixels around the object,\nwhich were made by using DIA. Then we checked whether\nthey have a companion with an opposite (increasing or decreasing brightness) light curve around them.\nIn this process, we also rejected the light curves which\nhave neighbours with similar light curves. Usually they are\naffected by nearby bright variable stars but were not masked\nand not clearly identified in previous procedures because the\nshape of their light curves are distorted from the original\nvariable due to the combination of the other artifacts or low\nS/N. The combination of the effect of the variable star and\nthe high proper motion object resemble the QSO light curve.\nFinally we have 97 QSO candidates. We summarize\nour selection criteria and the number of remaining candidates after each selection criterion in Table 1. We show\n20 sample light curves in Fig. 3 and list them in Ta-\n\nble 2, where the objects with V \u2212 I = (V \u2212 I)0 = 9.999\ndon't have V -band photometry. The complete list and light\ncurves of all 97 candidates are available in electronic format\nat http://www.astro.princeton.edu/\u223csumi/QSO-OGLEII/.\nWe also show their position on the CMD as open circles in\nFig. 2.\nAs we can see in Fig. 2, many of our candidates are\nrelatively bright (I0 = 16 \u223c 17), which is not expected\nfrom a genuine quasar Luminosity Function. This means the\ncontamination by irregular variable stars is higher in this\nrange than expected. In this work we didn't put any cut\nby their colour, because of the following reasons. For blue\nobjects, there are only few candidates with (V \u2212 I)0 < 0.4\n(Dobrzycki et al. (2003)). The Be stars which were a major\ncontamination in the previous work (Eyer 2002) are above\nthe threshold brightness I0 < 16 mag. For the redder objects, the extinction may be underestimated for background\nobjects because the extinctions are estimated only up to the\nGalactic centre in Sumi (2004). Some objects don't have V\nphotometry.\n\n\f4\n\nT. Sumi et al.\n\nFigure 3. 20 sample I-band light curves in 97 QSO candidates.

It is especially useful for the study of the bar\nstructure by using the stellar proper motions in these fields\n(Sumi et al. 2004). These QSOs will also be useful for the\nfuture astrometric program, such as Space Interferometry\nMission (SIM) and GAIA.\nSpectroscopic follow-up observations are required to\nconfirm these QSOs. The multi object and wide field spectrographs, such as VIMOS/VLT and LDSS/Magellan, are suitable for this purpose. We are planning to carry out spectroscopic follow-up observations in 4 of these fields (BUL SC1,\n2, 32 and 45) by using VIMOS/VLT. Follow-up observations\nin other fields are strongly encouraged.\nAs we can see in Fig. 2, there are more candidates at\nrelatively bright (I0 = 16 \u223c 17) range, which is not expected from a genuine quasar Luminosity Function. This\nmeans the contamination by irregular variable stars is higher\nin this range than the fainter range. So, the efficiency would\nbe higher in these fainter (I0 > 17) candidates. There are\nseveral objects which may be microlensing events, i.e. SC23191, SC2-4502, SC14-4009, SC19-4350, SC24-3042, SC303977, SC38-2298, and SC39-5030. We retained these objects\nbecause we do not know they are true microlensing or not.\nAlso there are several objects that have light curves too similar to each other to be QSOs, i.e. SC4-7246, SC13-332, SC13-\n\n775, SC20-3616, SC32-1795 SC42-3375, SC42-3772, SC46742. They have relatively constant baseline with W or Vshape dent in light curves. They could be new a type of\nvariable star. We did not reject them because we do not\nknow what they are.\nThe current dataset is not optimal to find QSOs. The\nOGLE-II Galactic Bulge data are relatively shallower than\nthe OGLE-II Magellanic Cloud data, which are optimized to\nfind microlensing events. Variable objects were only searched\nduring the first 3 years for some reason. We can improve the\nsensitivity by including the 4th year of OGLE-II and OGLEIII to increase the time-scale and the survey area.\nThe main contamination in this work was artifacts\naround bright stars or from high proper motion stars rather\nthan Be stars as in the previous work (Eyer 2002). Because\nthe foreground stars are closer than Magellanic Clouds, most\nBe stars are above the threshold brightness. On the other\nhand, due to much higher stellar density, the artifacts are\nincreased.\nThe work to avoid such artifacts in the photometry on\nthe subtracted images is underway. If such a new photometry\nwere to be done, then the efficiency in finding QSOs would\nbe increased.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to Prof. B.
