CV-QKD protocols using Gaussian modulation [3\u2013\n8], initially begin with Alice preparing a number of randomly\ndisplaced pure coherent states and sending them over an insecure quantum channel to Bob. Generally, it is assumed that\nAlice's states must be pure quantum states to a good approximation otherwise her ability to perform QKD will rapidly\nbecome compromised. This seemed to be borne out by recent calculations [9] that showed that the distance over which\nCV-QKD was secure, when Alice used mixed coherent states\nin the protocol, fell rapidly as the states became significantly\nimpure.\nIn this Letter, we show that, provided the channel transmission losses do not exceed 50 %, the security of quantum\ncryptography is not dependent on the channel transmission,\nand is therefore incredibly robust against significant levels of\nimpurity of Alice's states, without the additional previous requirement of purifiers [9]. This is a remarkable result as we\nmight naturally expect that as Alice's states become more and\nmore thermalized secure transmission over any finite distance\nwould become impossible. This further motivates an investigation of the security of CV-QKD as we move from optical\nfrequencies into the infrared and down into the microwave region. As the wavelength gets longer there is no direct way of\ndetecting single photons [10] thus ruling out discrete variable\napproaches. While CV measurements still apply, state preparation and the quantum channel become thermalized by the\nsignificant levels of background radiation that exist for longer\nwavelengths at room temperature. Here we show that CVQKD remains, in principle, possible over short distances, well\ninto the infrared and into the microwave regime. This surprising result highlights the possibility of short-range quantum\ncryptography applications at sub-optical frequencies.\nQuantum Cryptography using Gaussian States - Typical\nGaussian modulated CV-QKD protocols, begin with Alice\nrandomly modulating a vacuum state to create a coherent\n\nstate |\u03b1i [11]. This random modulation or displacement\n\u03b1 = QA + iPA contains two independent variables XS \u2208\n{QA , PA } chosen from a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution with variance VS and zero mean. It is these continuous\nvariables that will ultimately be used to construct a secret key\nbetween Alice and Bob. Alice then sends a whole ensemble\nof these randomly displaced pure coherent states to Bob over\na quantum channel which is monitored by the eavesdropper,\nEve. At the output of the channel, Bob measures the incoming\nstates using either homodyne [4] or heterodyne detection [5].\nThe initial modes prepared by Alice can be described in\nthe Heisenberg picture as X\u0302A = XS + X\u03020 where XS describes the classical signal and X\u03020 the thermal mode. Here\nthe quadratures Q\u0302 and P\u0302 are defined as: X\u0302A \u2208 {Q\u0302A , P\u0302A }\nand X\u03020 \u2208 {Q\u03020 , P\u03020 }. The overall variance V := V (X\u0302A ) of\nAlice's initially prepared mode is given by: V = VS + V0 .\nWe can further decompose the variance of the thermal mode\nV0 := V (X\u03020 ) into the variance of the pure vacuum mode\n(which is normalized to 1) and the variance of the unknown\npreparation noise at Alice's station \u03b2 to give: V0 = 1+\u03b2. Typically, in CV-QKD protocols, we simply have V = VS +1, i.e.,\nzero preparation noise (\u03b2 = 0). In this paper, we consider the\neffect of having non-zero preparation noise on Alice's mode\npreparation, i.e., \u03b2 > 0. We assume that this preparation noise\ncannot be controlled or manipulated by Eve.\nIn the analysis of CV-QKD protocols, the collective Gaussian attacks [12\u201314] are the most important. In fact, up to\na suitable symmetrization of the protocols [15], these attacks\nbound the most powerful eavesdropping strategy allowed by\nquantum mechanics [15]. The most general form of a collective Gaussian attack is explicitly described in Ref. [14]. This\nconsists in Eve interacting her (independent) ancilla modes\nwith Alice and Bob's mode for each run of the protocol in such\na way to generate a memoryless (one-mode) Gaussian channel. Eve's ancillas are then collected in a quantum memory\nwhose measurement is optimized on Alice and Bob's classical\ncommunications [14]. For a practical implementation of the\nprotocols, the most important collective Gaussian attack is the\n\n\f2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nSecret Key Rate R\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n3\n\n\u22123\n\n0.9\n\n0.92\n\n0.94\n0.96\nChannel Transmission T\n\n0.98\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1: Secret key rate R\u25ed versus channel transmission T using reverse reconciliation. Increasing the amount of unknown classical\nnoise on Alice's preparation modes in CV-QKD. Here the thermal\nradiation is increased: V0 = 1, 10, 102 , 103 from left to right, where\nW = 1 (lossy channel), VS = 105 and V0 = 1 is a pure vacuum\nmode.\n\nReverse Reconciliation - We begin our analysis by first using the CV-QKD protocol known as reverse reconciliation [4]\nwhich consists in Alice (and Eve) optimally estimating Bob's\nmeasurement outcomes. We note that the previous analysis\ngiven in [9] also considered thermal state CV-QKD using re-\n\n10\n10\n10\n\nSecret Key Rate R\n\none based on the entangling cloner [16] which is exactly the\nmodel considered in our paper. This consists in Eve perfectly\nreplacing the quantum channel between Alice and Bob with\nher own quantum channel where the loss is simulated by a\nbeamsplitter with transmission T (which ranges in value from\n0 to 1). She then creates her ancilla modes which are twomode squeezed states [11] (or commonly known as, EinsteinPodolsky-Rosen (EPR) states), with variance W . The modes\nof the EPR beam can be described by the operators \u00ca \u2032\u2032 and\n\u00ca. She keeps one mode of the beam \u00ca \u2032\u2032 and injects the other\nmode \u00ca into the unused port of the beamsplitter, resulting in\nthe output mode \u00ca \u2032 . Eve then collectively detects all modes\n\u00ca \u2032 and \u00ca \u2032\u2032 , gathered from each of the runs of the protocol, in\na final coherent measurement. The final stages of the protocol consists in Alice and Bob publicly revealing a subset of\ntheir data in order to estimate the channel transmission T and\nexcess channel noise W [2]. We also assume that Alice and\nBob (and Eve) know the variance of the unknown preparation noise \u03b2 in order to properly estimate the channel noise as\nopposed to the sum of the channel noise and the preparation\nnoise. However, the shot to shot displacement due to the excess preparation noise remains unknown to everyone. In the\nfinal steps of the protocol, Alice and Bob perform a reconciliation protocol (e.g., see [1]) to correct any errors they might\nhave between them and then finally privacy amplification [2]\nto reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to a negligible, and safe\namount.\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n2\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n3\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22127\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nChannel Transmission T\n\nFIG. 2: Secret key rate R\u25ee versus channel transmission T using direct reconciliation. Increasing the amount of unknown classical noise\non Alice's preparation modes in CV-QKD. Here the thermal radiation\nis increased: V0 = 1, 10, 102 , 103 , 104 from top to bottom, where\nW = 1, VS = 105 . We find that direct reconciliation does not show\nany deterioration in channel loss when excessively large amounts of\npreparation noise is added.\n\nverse reconciliation. However, for completeness, we give the\nderivation for reverse reconciliation which will be helpful in\ncalculating the direct reconciliation case and for a comparison between the two protocols. The secret key rate R\u25ed for\nreverse reconciliation where Bob uses homodyne detection\nis given by R\u25ed := I(XA : XB ) \u2212 I(XB : E). Here\nI(XA : XB ) is called the mutual information between Alice and Bob and defined in terms of the Shannon (or classical)\nentropy [17]. The quantum mutual information between Eve\nand Bob I(XB : E) is given by the Holevo information [18]\nand describes the most amount of information one can extract\nfrom a quantum state.\nThe secret key rate R\u25ed can be calculated (see Appendix for\ncomplete derivation) for various values of preparation noise,\ni.e., V0 = 1, 10, 100, 1000. The results are plotted in Fig. 1\nfor a lossy channel (i.e., W = 1 which corresponds to Eve\nsimply inserting a vacuum state into the unused port of the\nbeamsplitter). We see that, as expected, the security is dependent on the channel transmission, and starts deteriorating\nrapidly as the excess preparation noise is increased. In fact, after only a modest increase in preparation noise (from V0 = 1\nto V0 = 10), the secure region has shrunk to T \u2248> 0.89.\nDirect Reconciliation - We now turn our attention to another CV-QKD scheme known as direct reconciliation [3].\nDirect reconciliation, was the first protocol to show that one\ncould use Gaussian modulated coherent states to create a secure key. Unlike, reverse reconciliation, this protocol is a\nforward-way scheme where Bob (and Eve) are trying to optimally estimate the values of Alice's initial displacements, or\nencodings, QA and PA . However, direct reconciliation has\nthe drawback in its inability to create a secret key when the\n\n\f3\n10\n\n4\n\nInsecure\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\nDirect Reconciliation\n\n10\n\nSecure\n\nMore and more thermal\n\nTolerable Excess Noise \u03b2\n\n10\n\n2\n\n1\n\nion\niliat\n\nerse\nRev\n\nonc\nRec\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nChannel Transmission T\n\nFIG. 3: Tolerable preparation (classical) excess noise \u03b2 = V0 \u2212 1\nversus channel transmission T for direct and reverse reconciliation\nover a lossy channel. The area under the solid (blue) curve indicates\nthe previous best secure region threshold using reverse reconciliation [9]. However, for direct reconciliation, after T = 0.5, one can\nimmediately obtain many orders of magnitude improvement in the\nsecurity threshold.\n\nReverse Direct Reconciliation\n-6\n\n10\n\nOptical 1500nm\n14\n\n10\n\nSECURE REGION\n-5\n\nInfrared\n\n13\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\nWavelength \u03bb (m)\n\n10\n\nFrequency \u03c9 (Hz)\n\nloss is greater than 3 dB. This corresponds to T < 0.5 and\ncan be intuitively thought of as Eve sharing more common information with Alice than Bob does. Consequently, reverse\nreconciliation (or post-selection [7]) is usually considered the\nmost practical CV-QKD protocol [19]. However, as we will\nsee, despite these shortcomings, direct reconciliation offers a\nsurprising advantage as a potential platform for noise tolerant\nshort-range QKD.\nThe secret key rate R\u25ee for direct reconciliation using homodyne detection is defined as R\u25ee := I(XA : XB ) \u2212 I(XA :\nE) where I(XA : E) is again the Holevo quantity but now\ndefined between Eve and Alice. We can now calculate the\nsubsequent key rates (see Appendix for details). In Fig. 2 we\nhave plotted the resulting secret key rates for various values\nof V0 using W = 1 and VS = 105 . We find that direct reconciliation has the amazing feature that as the preparation noise\nbecomes more and more significant (even up to 104 times that\nof the variance of the pure vacuum mode) only the secret key\nrate decreases and not the channel transmission. So for any\nvalue of preparation noise the initial starting point is always\nT = 0.5 (c.f. reverse reconciliation where modest increases\nin noise reduce the secure region close to unity transmission,\ni.e., see Fig. 1). The basic physics is that, for T > 0.5, the\npresence of quantum noise always gives Alice and Bob a direct information advantage over Eve. Increased preparation\nnoise reduces this advantage, but it always remains finite. In\ncontrast, for reverse reconciliation, Alice's ability to estimate\nwhat Bob received is rapidly compromised by the preparation\nnoise. This removes their information advantage over Eve.\nIn Fig. 3 we have a security threshold plot for direct and\nreverse reconciliation for W = 1. The solid (blue) curve is\nthe previous best bound derived using reverse reconciliation\nand is given by [9]: \u03b2 < (1 \u2212 T )\u22121 . On the same plot we\nhave the new direct reconciliation bound which shows a substantial improvement over the previous reverse reconciliation\nbound. Remarkably, we can see how direct reconciliation is\nunaffected by the channel transmission once T > 0.5 and is\nsecure for a minimum of 4 orders of magnitude of preparation\nnoise. Therefore, it is best to use reverse reconciliation when\nT \u2264 0.5 and direct reconciliation when T > 0.5. Additionally, this result is robust to the addition of small amounts of\nexcess noise on the quantum channel (i.e., W > 1) which\nmoves the transmission limit slightly over 50% but retains\nqualitatively the same behavior as the lossy case [20].\nInfrared to Microwave Quantum Cryptography - It is interesting to consider a possible application of our results: wireless CV-QKD at infrared to microwave frequencies. Today,\na large number of popular wireless communication technologies rely on such frequencies to distribute information. Due\nto the ubiquitous nature of such devices, their security is of\nfundamental importance. Moving to frequencies lower than\noptical rules out discrete variable QKD because of the lack\nof photon counting capabilities. The problem for CV-QKD\nis that operating at lower frequencies at room temperature inevitably introduces a significant amount of thermal noise. In\ncontrast to the previous section, we now consider a simplified\n\nINSECURE REGION\n\n12\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\nMicrowave\n11\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n0.55\n\n0.6\n\n0.65\n\n0.7\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\nTransmission T\n\nFIG. 4: Security of quantum cryptography over various electromagnetic wave frequencies (at room temperature) as a function of\nchannel transmission.

Our results\nshow that direct reconciliation should be used when channel losses\nare less than 50% and reverse reconciliation otherwise. We note that\nat each point the same impurity applies to both Alice and Eve with\nVS = 108 .\n\nwireless communication protocol where both Alice's preparation modes and the quantum channel (Eve) are affected by\nthe thermal background. When considering Eve we assume\nthat she prepares her attack within a cryostat which allows\nher to essentially prepare pure modes away from the effect of\n\n\f4\nthe background radiation. Then to cover her tracks she adds\nknown excess noise to her pure states to emulate the thermal\nnoise of the environment.\nIn the previous section we showed that direct reconciliation\nis significantly more robust against preparation noise than reverse reconciliation and is consequently better suited to our\ncurrent analysis. Given that, the next step is to calculate\nhow strong the thermal modes are at particular frequencies\nfrom optical down to the microwave (1 GHz (\u03bb = 30 cm)\nto 300 GHz (\u03bb = 1 mm)). To do this we first write the\naverage photon number n\u0304 in terms of the quadrature variance V using n\u0304 = h\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2i = (V \u2212 1)/2 =\u21d2 V = 2n\u0304 + 1\nwhere we have symmetrized both quadratures, i.e., V :=\nV (Q\u0302) = V (P\u0302 ) and the annihilation operator \u00e2 is defined\nas \u00e2 = (Q\u0302 + iP\u0302 )/2. Secondly, the average photon number\nis equal to n\u0304 = [exp(~\u03c9/kB T ) \u2212 1]\u22121 [11] and represents\nthe blackbody radiation spectrum. For example, at room temperature T = 300 K and using a microwave frequency of\n\u03c9 = 1 GHz we find that the variance of the thermal mode\nis V = 7.85 \u00d7 104 ; while at the other end of the microwave\nspectrum (\u03c9 = 300 GHz) the variance is V = 2.63 \u00d7 102 .\nUsing the analysis from the previous section, we can calculate the secret key rates using direct reconciliation. In Fig. 4\nwe plot the security of CV-QKD from the optical frequency\n(1550 nm) into the infrared region and down into the microwave frequency as a function of channel line transmission.\nWe point out that the secure region corresponds to R > 0.\nWe find a window of security for CV-QKD throughout all of\nthe infrared region and into the microwave frequency albeit\nwith smaller allowed levels of loss. In the mid-infrared region transmission of T \u2248 0.8 is required whilst in the case\nof the microwave region we see that a secure key can only be\ngenerated when the transmission is higher than T \u2248 0.9969.\nNonetheless, it is interesting that a small security window, in\nprinciple, exists. Future analysis will look at improving the\nregion where infrared and microwave CV-QKD is secure. For\nexample, in [6] they showed that the security thresholds for\ndirect reconciliation could be improved (and in fact beat the\n3 dB loss limit) if two-way quantum communication was used.\nFurthermore, post-selection [7] could also be used to investigate a possible way to combat the high preparation noise.\nConclusion - In conclusion, we have shown that when considering unknown preparation noise in continuous-variable\nQKD, direct reconciliation is significantly more robust than\nreverse reconciliation when the channel loss does not exceed\n50%. Incredibly, direct reconciliation showed no deterioration\nin the loss threshold, only in secret key rates, even when the\nvariance of the thermal noise is as much as 104 times greater\nthan that of the pure vacuum mode. Furthermore, we have\nshown that infrared to microwave quantum cryptography is,\nin principle, possible over short distances when using continuous variables and opens up the possibility of further avenues of investigations.

Such Gaussian formalisms\ncan be found elsewhere in the literature typically in the context of quantum information using continuous variables (for\nexample, see [6, 21\u201323]). However, in what follows, we give\nthe reader a self-contained treatment for what is needed to understand and derive the results given in the main text of the\npaper.\nTo begin with, we can define the quadrature row vector \u0176,\nwhich describes a bosonic system [24] of n modes, as:\n\u0176 = (Q\u03021 , P\u03021 , ..., Q\u0302n , P\u0302n ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0176l is the lth element of the vector. This satisfies the\ncommutator relation:\n[\u0176l , \u0176m ] = 2i\u03a9lm ,\n\n(2)\n\nfor 1 \u2264 l, m, \u2264 2n. Here the matrix \u03a9 defines the symplectic\nform and is given as\n\u03a9 :=\n\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nM\n0 1\n,\n\u22121 0\n\n(3)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere \u03a9lm denote the row l and column m of the matrix, e.g.,\n\u03a911 is the first row and first column entry of \u03a9. Firstly, the\nnotation for the above matrix can be explainedL\nwith a simple\nexample. For n = 2 mode case the direct sum\nmeans that\nwe form two 2 \u00d7 2 block diagonal matrices to create a larger\n\n\f5\n4 \u00d7 4 matrix, i.e.,\n\u03a9n=2 :=\n\nwhere\n\n2\nM\nk=1\n\n0 1\n\u22121 0\n\n!\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0 1\n\uf8ec\n\u22121\n0\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0 1\n\u22121 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\ng(\u03bd) :=\n(4)\n\nThese symplectic eigenvalues can be calculated using the formula\n\nwhere the empty spaces indicate zero elements. Secondly, the\ncompact version of the commutator given in Eq. (2) can now\nbe understood using the simple case of one mode (n = 1)\nwhere\n!\n0 1\n\u03a9n=1 :=\n,\n(5)\n\u22121 0\nand \u01761 := Q\u03021 and \u01762 := P\u03021 for l, m = 1, 2. Therefore Eq. (2)\nis a compact way of saying the following:\n[\u01761 , \u01761 ] = [Q\u03021 , Q\u03021 ] = 2i\u03a911 = 0,\n[\u01761 , \u01762 ] = [Q\u03021 , P\u03022 ] = 2i\u03a912 = 2i,\n[\u01762 , \u01761 ] = [P\u03022 , Q\u03021 ] = 2i\u03a921 = \u22122i,\n\n(6)\n\n[\u01762 , \u01762 ] = [P\u03022 , P\u03022 ] = 2i\u03a922 = 0.\nA Gaussian bosonic state \u03c1 is fully characterized by its displacement\nh\u0176i = Tr(\u0176\u03c1),\n\n(7)\n\nand its correlation matrix (CM). The various elements of a\ncorrelation matrix V can be calculated using the following formulas. Firstly, the off-diagonal terms:\nVlm :=\n\n1\nh\u0176l \u0176m + \u0176m \u0176l i \u2212 h\u0176l ih\u0176m i,\n2\n\n(9)\n\nWe can see that the variance of each quadrature is on the diagonal, whilst on the off-diagonal we have the zero correlation\n(meaning they are independent) terms.\nThe von Neumann entropy [25]\n\nn\nX\n\nk=1\n\ng(\u03bdk ),\n\nwhere \u03bd \u2265 1. The above notation means that you first find\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix i\u03a9V and then take the absolute\nvalues. As it turns out these eigenvalues (known also as the\nsymplectic spectrum) are a powerful tool which allows one to\ndetermine many important features of a Gaussian system. Although Eq. (14) gives one a way of calculating the spectrum,\nthe output from using such a formula can sometimes lead very\ncomplicated equations. In certain circumstances, we are able\nto simplify the calculation of the eigenvalues. Let's look at\nthat now. First, consider a generic two-mode CM in block\nform\n!\nA C\nV=\n.\n(15)\nCT B\nIt is known [27] that its symplectic eigenvalues \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 can\nbe written in the form\nr \u0010\n\u0011\np\n1\n\u03bd1,2 =\n\u2206 \u00b1 \u22062 \u2212 4 det V ,\n(16)\n2\nwhere det V means the determinant of the matrix V and\n\n(17)\n\nIn particular, let us consider a CM of the form\n!\n\u221a\nT cZ\naI\n,\nV= \u221a\nT cZ\nbI\nwhere c \u2265 0, T \u2208 [0, 1] and\n!\n1 0\nI=\n0 1\n\nZ=\n\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n\n!\n\n(18)\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nWe can easily verify that det V = (ab \u2212 c2 T )2 and \u2206 =\na2 + b2 \u2212 2c2 T . As a consequence, the eigenvalues take the\nsimple expression\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\u221a\n\u03bd1,2 :=\ny \u00b1 (a \u2212 b) ,\n(20)\n2\nwhere y := (a + b)2 \u2212 4c2 T \u2265 4.\n\n(11)\nReverse Reconciliation\n\nof a Gaussian state \u03c1 can be written in terms of its symplectic\neigenvalues \u03bdk as [26]\nS(\u03c1) =\n\n(14)\n\n\u2206 := det A + det B + 2 det C.\n\nQualitatively it means that the diagonal terms contain the variances whilst the off-diagonal terms contain the correlations.\nAn example might help here. A simple vacuum state, where\nthe variance of the quadratures is normalized to one, has a CM\ngiven by\n!\n1 0\nVvac =\n.\n(10)\n0 1\n\nS(\u03c1) = \u2212Tr(\u03c1log2 \u03c1),\n\n\u03bd = |i\u03a9V|,\n\n(8)\n\nand the diagonal elements:\nVll = h\u0176l2 i \u2212 h\u0176l i2 := V (\u0176l ).\n\n\u0010\u03bd + 1\u0011 \u0010\u03bd \u2212 1\u0011\n\u0010\u03bd \u2212 1\u0011\n\u0010\u03bd + 1\u0011\nlog2\n\u2212\nlog2\n.\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(13)\n\n(12)\n\nThe secret key rate R\u25ed for reverse reconciliation where Bob\nuses homodyne detection is given by\nR\u25ed := I(XA : XB ) \u2212 I(XB : E),\n\n(21)\n\n\f6\nwhere I(XA : XB ) is known as the mutual information between Alice and Bob and I(XB : E) the mutual information\nbetween Bob and Eve. We have a secure key when the key\nrate is positive, i.e.,\nR > 0.\n\n(22)\n\nAnother way to think about this is a secure key can be synthesized when Eve has less information than Alice and Bob:\nI(XA : XB ) > I(XB : E).\n\n(23)\n\nof Alice's signal not his estimate of both the signal and noise.\nCalculating this explicitly we get:\nV (Q\u0302B |QA ) = V (P\u0302B |PA ) = (1 \u2212 T )W + T V0 := b1 .\n(33)\nUsing Eq. (26) with Eqs. (27) and (28) we calculate Alice and\nBob's mutual information to be\nh (1 \u2212 T )W + T V + T V i\n1\nS\n0\n. (34)\nI(XA : XB ) = log2\n2\n(1 \u2212 T )W + T V0\n\nWe also note that, for Alice and Bob, the variable X\u0302 corresponds to either of the two quadratures {Q\u0302, P\u0302 }, such that\n\nWe now turn our attention to calculating the mutual information between Eve and Bob. This is given by the Holevo\ninformation [18] defined as\n\nX\u0302A = {Q\u0302A , P\u0302A },\n\n(24)\n\nX\u0302B = {Q\u0302B , P\u0302B }.\n\n(25)\n\nI(XB : E) := S(E) \u2212 S(E|XB ).\n\nFirstly, let us calculate the mutual information between Alice\nand Bob where\nI(XA : XB ) := H(XB ) \u2212 H(XB |XA ).\n\n(26)\n\nHere\nH(XB ) =\n\n1\nlog2 V (X\u0302B ),\n2\n\n(27)\n\nis the Shannon (or classical) entropy and\nH(XB |XA ) =\n\n1\nlog2 V (X\u0302B |XA ),\n2\n\n(28)\n\nis known as the conditional Shannon entropy [17]. To determine X\u0302B we set up a generic quantum channel with transmission T \u2208 [0, 1] with excess noise N\u0302 and model it using a\nbeamsplitter equation, where the transmitted output (received\nby Bob) is given by:\n\u221a\n\u221a\nX\u0302B = T X\u0302A + 1 \u2212 T N\u0302 .\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\nwhere both quadratures have been symmetrized and V (N\u0302 ) :=\nW . Also, the variance of Alice's modes is given by\nV = VS + V0 ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere VS is the variance of the initial signal encodings and\nV0 is the variance of the vacuum state (see main text for more\ndetail). In Eq. (28) the conditional variance term V (X\u0302B |XA )\nis derived by setting up an optimal estimator equation (e.g.,\nsee its use in [6] or [28]):\nV (X\u0302B |XA ) = V (X\u0302B ) \u2212\n\n|hX\u0302B XS i|2\n,\nV (XS )\n\nIn the literature it is also common to use the notation \u03c7 for the\nHolevo (information) bound (for more background on both\nthe classical and quantum information formulas, see e.g., [25,\n29]).\nHere the quantum entropies S(E) := S(\u03c1E ) and S(E|XB )\nare found by calculating the eigenvalues, or symplectic spectrum \u03bd, of their corresponding CMs: VE and VE|XB , respectively. Eve's CM is made up from the two modes \u00ca \u2032 and \u00ca \u2032\u2032\n(see main text for details) and is given by\n!\n\u2206[eV , eV ] \u03c6Z\nVE (V, V ) =\n,\n(36)\n\u03c6Z\nWI\nwhere\neV := (1 \u2212 T )V + T W,\n\n(37)\n\nand the notation \u2206[*, *] simply means a diagonal matrix with\nthe arguments [*, *] on the diagonal entries and also\n\u03c6 = [T (W 2 \u2212 1)]1/2 .\n\n(38)\n\nEve's symplectic spectra can be determined by using Eq. (20)\n\nThe variance of the above equation is given by\nV (Q\u0302B ) = V (P\u0302B ) = (1 \u2212 T )W + T V := bV ,\n\n(35)\n\n(32)\n\nwhere specifically here we have XS \u2208 {QA , PA } (the signal)\nrather than X\u0302A (signal plus noise) because it is Bob's estimate\n\n\u03bdE =\n\n1 p\n[ (eV + W )2 \u2212 4T (W 2 \u2212 1) \u00b1 (eV \u2212 W )]. (39)\n2\n\nEve's conditional CM is given by\n\nVE|XB = VE \u2212 (\u03b2V )\u22121 C\u03a0CT ,\nwhere VE is defined in Eq. (36) and\n!\n1 0\n\u03a0 :=\n.\n0 0\n\n(40)\n\n(41)\n\nFurthermore, C is a 4 \u00d7 2 matrix describing the quantum correlations between Eve's modes {\u00ca \u2032 , \u00ca \u2032\u2032 } and Bob's output\nmode X\u0302B and is defined as\n!\n!\nh\u00ca \u2032 X\u0302B iI\n\u03beI\nC :=\n=\n,\n(42)\nh\u00ca \u2032\u2032 X\u0302B iZ\n\u03c6Z\n\n\f7\nwhere\n\nand\n\np\n\u03be = \u2212 T (1 \u2212 T )(VS + V0 \u2212 W ),\n\u03c6=\n\nand we have used\n\np\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 T W 2 \u2212 1,\n\n(43)\n\nwhere VE is defined in Eq. (36). Using Eq.
