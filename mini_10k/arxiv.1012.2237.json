In particular, HST has\ndiscovered the optical counterpart to seven INSs. Four of them are classical rotationpowered pulsars, one of which is the first ms-pulsar identified in the optical, the others\nare X-ray Dim INSs (XDINSs). Among the major HST achievement in optical studies\nof INSs (see, e.g. Mignani 2010b), one should note the many detections in the near-IR\nand in the near-UV, high spatial resolution phase-averaged polarimetry observations of\npulsars and their associated pulsar-wind nebulae (PWNe), proper motion and, in some\ncases, parallax measurements for several rotation-powered pulsars and XDINSs. Here, I\npresent the results of the last observations of INSs performed by the WFPC2.\n\nPSR B0540\u221269\nPSR B0540\u221269 is a young (\u223c 1600 yr old) pulsar (P = 50 ms) in the LMC, discovered\nin the X-rays, and soon after observed in the optical with a V \u223c 22.5 counterpart (Caraveo et al. 1992), and only later in radio. Because of its similar energetic (\u0116 \u223c 1.5 \u00d7 1038\nerg s\u22121 ) and magnetic field (B \u223c 5 \u00d7 1012 G) is also referred as the \"Crab twin\". We\nobserved PSR B0540\u221269 for six HST orbits: four were devoted to polarimetry observations (1800 s each) through the 606W+POLQ filter and two to multi-band photometry\nin the 336W (780 s), 450W (780 s), 555W (300 s), 675W (420 s), 814W (420 s) filters,\nto provide, for the first time, an homogeneous spectral coverage from \u223c 3000 to 8000 \u00c5.\nFirst of all, we used our imaging observations to set new constraints on the pulsar proper\nmotion. Using a sample of WFPC2 observations spanning 4 years, Serafimovich et al.\n(2004) claimed a marginally significant proper motion of 4.9 \u00b1 2.3 mas yr\u22121 , possibly\nparallel to the nebula symmetry axis, as in the case of the Crab and Vela pulsar/PWNe.\n\n\fHowever, more recent WFPC2 observations spanning 10 years (De Luca et al. 2007), did\nnot confirm this claim and yielded a proper motion upper limit of 1.2 mas yr\u22121 (3\u03c3 ). Our\nnew WFPC2 observations, extending the time baseline to 12 years, allowed to refine the\nupper limit to 1 mas yr\u22121 (3\u03c3 ), implying a transverse velocity vt < 250 km s\u22121 (Mignani\net al. 2010a). At the same time, we used the available multi-epoch image database to\ncompute the pulsar coordinates through absolute optical astrometry. From the average\nof different measurements, we determined the pulsar position with an accuracy of 5\nmas per coordinate (1\u03c3 ), which supersedes in accuracy previously reported values (see\nMignani et al. 2010a) and has been used by Gradari et al. (2010) as a reference for the\npulsar optical timing observations. We used our multi-band imaging observations, together with archival WFPC2 broad band images, to accurately characterise the pulsar's\noptical spectrum. Middleditch et al. (1987) showed a possible evidence of a flux excess\nin the U-band with respect to the underlying power-law (PL) continuum, not confirmed\nby Nasuti et al. (1997). More recently, using a small set of broad/medium-band WFPC2\nimages, Serafimovich et al. (2004) measured a PL with spectral index \u03b1 = 1.07 \u00b1 0.2.\nUsing our extended WFPC2 database, we measured \u03b1 = 0.70 \u00b1 0.07, more consistent\nwith the values measured in other rotation-powered pulsars, with no evidence of a flux\nexcess in the U-band. Interestingly enough, the optical PL lies well below the extrapolation of the X-ray one, which implies a double break in the optical\u2013to\u2013X-ray spectrum,\nnever observed so far in other rotation-powered pulsars. For PSR B0540\u221269, only a VLT\nmeausurement of a phase-averaged polarisation degree (PD) of \u223c 5% (quoted without\nerrors) existed prior to our observations (Wagner & Seifert 2000), probably polluted\nby the contribution of the SNR and by the difficulties in resolving the pulsar in the\nlow-spatial resolution VLT images. After subtracting the contribution of the foreground\npolarisation and of the SNR, we measured a pulsar polarisation PD = 16% \u00b1 4%, with a\nposition angle (PA) of 22 \u00b1 12\u25e6 . This is closely aligned with the possible proper motion\ndirection of the knot observed southwest of the pulsar (De Luca et al. 2007), which is\nalso polarised (PD \u223c 10%), with its PA approximately aligned with that of the pulsar.\n\nPSR B1055\u221252\nPSR B1055\u221252 is a middle-aged (\u223c 535 kyr old) radio, X and \u03b3 -ray pulsar (\u0116 \u223c\n3\u00d71034 erg s\u22121 ; B \u223c 1.1\u00d71012 G) and, together with PSR B0656+14 and Geminga, one\nof the so-called \"Three Musketeers\". In the optical, the detection of PSR B1055\u221252 has\nbeen troublesome due to a bright star (V \u223c 14), located at \u223c 4.4 arcsec from the pulsar,\nwhich hampered all ground-based observations (e.g., Mignani et al. 2010b). Indeed,\nthe pulsar counterpart was only detected thanks to the high spatial resolution and nearUV sensitivity of the HST/FOC (Mignani et al. 1997). We observed PSR B1055\u221252\nwith the HST both in the near-UV (140 LP filter; 5600 s) with the ACS/SBC and in the\noptical with the WFPC2 in the 450W (1800 s), 555W (1800s) and 702W (3600 s) filters.\nThe pulsar identification was complicated by the uncertainty on its coordinates (epoch\n1978 in the ATNF catalogue) which could be up to \u223c 4 arcseconds due to its unknown\nproper motion. We detected a source positionally concident, within the uncertainty of the\nHST astrometry, with the pulsar candidate counterpart both in the SBC (m140LP \u223c 22.6),\nand in the WFPC2 images (m555W \u223c 25.4; m702W \u223c 26.08; m450W > 24.97). Thus, its\n\n\fblue colours certified its identification with the pulsar (Mignani et al. 2010c). Using\nour high-spatial resolution WFPC2 images, we obtained an updated measurement of\nthe pulsar coordinates (epoch 2008.18) through absolute optical astrometry (\u223c 0.15\narcsec positional accuracy), consistent with the new radio timing position (Manchester,\nR.N., private communication). From the comparison with the ATNF radio coordinates\nwe also obtained the first measurement of the pulsar absolute proper motion which is\nconsistent with the relative one measured from the comparison of the pulsar position\nmeasured in the SBC and FOC images, taken 12 years apart: \u03bc\u03b1 = 43 \u00b1 6 mas yr\u22121 and\n\u03bc\u03b4 = \u22125 \u00b1 6 mas yr\u22121 . This implies a transverse velocity vt \u223c (70 \u00b1 8) km s\u22121 , for a\npulsar distance of 350 pc (see below). We then computed the backward extrapolation of\nthe pulsar galactic orbit to locate its birth place and indentify its parental open cluster,\nafter backward-extrapolating the orbits of selected candidate clusters. Unfortunately,\nboth the unknown pulsar radial velocity and the uncertain distance did not allow us\nto determine an unambiguous association. A more accurate determination of the pulsar\ndistance, e.g. from the measurement of the radio parallax, will be important to narrow the\nlist of candidate parental clusters. We used our multi-band images to characterise, for the\nfirst time, the pulsar optical-UV spectrum. This can be described by the combination of\na power-law (PLO ; \u03b1O = 1.05 \u00b1 0.34) and a Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ). Interestingly enough,\nthe RJ is above the extrapolation of the cold blackbody (BBC ) component used to fit the\nXMM-Newton spectrum (De Luca et al. 2005), together with a hot blackbody (BBH ) and\na power-law (PLX ). This suggests a three-component thermal map for the neutron star\nsurface, unlike the other \"Musketeers\". The temperature of the RJ component, however,\nis parametrised by the ratio (d/R)2 , where d and R are the neutron star distance and the\nradius of the optical emitting region, respectively. To solve the degeneracy, we imposed\nthat R < RNS,13 , where RNS,13 is the neutron star radius in units of 13 km (as seen from\ninfinity) and that the BB extrapolation of the RJ yields an X-ray flux much smaller than\nthat of BBC . From the limit case R \u223c RNS,13 we then derive a distance estimate of d \u223c 350\npc, i.e. lower than the 750 pc value estimated from the dispersion measure (DM). The\nnew distance yields a factor of 4 smaller radius (5.7 km) for BBC , which has important\nimplications for comparisons with neutron star cooling model, and implies a downward\nrescaling for the different multi-wavelength emission efficiencies, with the \u03b3 -ray one\nbeing \u223c 0.13%. The best fit PLO is below the extrapolation in the optical domain of\nPLX (\u03b1X = 0.7 \u00b1 0.1), as seen in many other rotation-powered pulsars. This suggests a\nspectral break between the X-ray and optical-UV regions. However, the extrapolation of\nthe \u03b3 -ray PL (\u03b1\u03b3 \u223c 0.5) possibly matches the optical one, as seen, e.g in the Vela pulsar,\nalthough it is not a common feature of all rotation-powered pulsars.\n\nTHE CCO IN PKS 1209\u221252\nThe X-ray source 1E 1207.4\u22125209 in the PKS 1209\u221252 SNR is one of the three\nCCOs found to feature X-ray pulsations so far, with a period P = 424ms. Optical/IR\nobservations with the HST/ACS and with the VLT/ISAAC spotted a possible counterpart\nfrom a claimed coincidence with the source Chandra position (Pavlov et al. 2004).\nHowever, more recent astrometry recalibration of the HST images suggested that the\nproposed counterpart was off the Chandra error circle. This has been confirmed also\n\n\fby updated Chandra astrometry of the source (see De Luca et al. 2011 and references\ntherein). While this is already a strong argument against the association of the object\nwith the CCO, the final evidence comes from the measurement of its proper motion with\nrespect to the centre of the SNR. Indeed, if associated with the CCO, the counterpart\nshould feature a proper motion \u03bc \u223c 70 mas yr\u22121 , given the SNR age of \u223c 7000 years and\nthe offset of the CCO with respect to the SNR centre (\u223c 8 arcmin). We observed the CCO\nfield with the WFPC2 in the 814W filter (2000 s) and we performed relative astrometry\nwith respect to archival ACS observations performed in 2003 through the same filter.\nWe obtained a 3\u03c3 limit on the proper motion of \u03bc = 7 mas yr\u22121 , which would imply a\nSNR age larger than 70 000 years. Thus, such a measurement firmly establishes that the\nproposed counterpart is not associated with the CCO. From the available HST and VLT\nphotometry, complemented by public Spitzer data, we could set a limit of \u223c 0.1 solar\nmasses on a stellar mass companion. The upper limits on the optical/IR spectrum are\nalso compatible with the presence of a debris disc. Using disc emission models (Perna\net al. 2000) and the derived CCO X-ray luminosity LX \u223c 2.2 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 at a 2.2\nkpc distance we determined, for the assumed disc parameters (inclination, albedo, inner\nradius) and for the constraint on the magnetic field (B < 8 \u00d7 1010 G), an upper limit\nof 8 \u00d7 1011 g s\u22121 on the disc \u1e40. This is too small for a putative disc to significantly\ncontribute to the polar cap re-heating, as it has been proposed in some CCO scenarios.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nINS astronomy with the refurbished HST (up to 2015) has still many potentials, thanks to\nits instrument suite, covering the near-UV (COS, ACS/SBC, STIS), near-IR (NICMOS,\nWFC3) and optical (ACS/WFC, WFC3), as well as timing (COS, STIS), polarimetry\n(ACS, NICMOS), and spectroscopy capabilities. This allows to study the NS magnetosphere, the NS interior, to search for debris discs, and to pursue new INS identifications.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Caraveo, P. A., Bignami, G.
