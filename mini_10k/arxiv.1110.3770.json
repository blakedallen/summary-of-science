We focus on the universal quantities that\ncan be extracted from the R\u00e9nyi entropies S\u03b1 . The most important information is encoded in\nsome functions denoted by F\u03b1 . We compute F2 and we show that F\u03b1 \u2212 1 and Fv.N. , corresponding\nto the von Neumann entropy, can be negative, in contrast to what observed in all models examined\nso far. An exact relation between the entanglement of disjoint subsystems in the XX model and\nthat in a chain embodying two quantum Ising models is a by-product of our investigations.\n\nIn the last two decades, the entanglement entropy has\nbecome one of the most important indicators of critical\nbehavior in many-body systems [1, 2]. In the neighborhood of a quantum phase transition the area law [3], i.e.\nthe proportionality between the entropy and the contact\nsurface with the remainder of the system, does not work in\n1D, where the entropy turns out to be proportional to the\nlogarithm of the characteristic subsystem's length. The\nfactor in front of the logarithm is generally universal [4\u20136]\nand, in conformal systems, is proportional to the central\ncharge [7]. In fact, the entanglement entropy provides one\nof the most accurate ways of detecting the value of the\ncentral charge.\nMany recent works [8\u201315] have focused on the entanglement of disjoint intervals in conformal systems, because it\nis also sensitive to universal details of the conformal field\ntheory (CFT) different from the central charge. R\u00e9nyi en1\ntropies S\u03b1 = 1\u2212\u03b1\nlog Tr\u03c1\u03b1 of two disjoint blocks of lengths\nl1 and l2 at the distance r, as long as \u03b1 is integer, are\nproportional to the logarithm of the four-point function of\nparticular twist fields [10]. For any given \u03b1, a (bounded)\nl1 l2\n,\nuniversal function of the four-point ratio x = (l1 +r)(l\n2 +r)\nusually denoted by F\u03b1 (x), is the main information, besides\nthe central charge c, that can be extracted from the R\u00e9nyi\nentropy\n\nthe subsystem with the rest manifests in the identity\nF\u03b1 (x) = F\u03b1 (1 \u2212 x). The entanglement of a single spin\nblock can be recovered in the limit as r approaches \u221e,\nand hence x \u2192 1. Indeed, when the blocks are far enough,\nthe reduced density matrix of the two blocks is expected\nto factorize in the tensor product of the reduced density\nmatrices of each block (interaction is local). Thus, the\nR\u00e9nyi entropies (in particular the entanglement entropy)\nbecome simply the sum of the entropies of the blocks. This\nmeans that, normalizing the universal function in such a\nway that F\u03b1 (0) = F\u03b1 (1) = 1, the constant c\u2032\u03b1 in eq. (1) is\nexactly the additive constant of the single interval [7]\nS\u03b1 =\n\n1+\u03b1c\nlog l + c\u2032\u03b1 .\n\u03b1 6\n\n(2)\n\nFor non-interacting fermions F\u03b1 (x) is equal to 1 for any\nx [16], however this is peculiar to the fermionic representation of non-interacting models [11], whilst in the spin representation, as exactly computed in refs. [10, 14] in CFT,\nF\u03b1 (x) is a complicated function. It has been determined\nonly for integral values of \u03b1 for the free boson compactified\non a circle [10,15] and for the quantum Ising model [13,14].\nThe universal function Fv.N. (x) \u2261 \u2202\u03b1 F\u03b1 (x) \u03b1=1 , corresponding to the von Neumann entropy, is still unknown\nfor any model.\nOne of the goals of this work is to provide exact results\nl1 l2 r(l1 + r + l2 )\nlog F\u03b1 (x)\n1+\u03b1c\nfor F\u03b1 (x), especially for F2 (x), in a family of models whose\n\u2032\nlog\n+ 2c\u03b1 .\n+\nS\u03b1 =\ncontinuum limit is conformal. In particular, the finite-size\n\u03b1 6\n(l1 + r)(r + l2 )\n1\u2212\u03b1\n(1) scaling can be obtained by substituting any length l with\n\u03c0l\nThe invariance of the entropies under interchanging the chord length L\n\u03c0 sin L [7], where L is the chain's size.\np-1\n\n\fM. Fagotti\nIncidentally, in refs. [17, 18] it has been shown that the\nexcited states associated to primary operators in a CFT\nhave instead peculiar finite-size scalings. The results presented in this Letter are the first analytic ones obtained\nin a framework different from CFT.\nIn light of the numerical investigations [11, 13, 15] and\nof the CFT predictions [10,14], one could wonder whether\nsome properties, always observed in F\u03b1 (x), are indeed general. We are referring to the positivity of F\u03b1 (x) \u2212 1 and\nof Fv.N. (x), as well as to the concavity of Fv.N. (x). The\nlatter could be thought as a consequence of some general\nproperty, in the same way as strong subadditivity implies\nthat the von Neumann entropy of a single interval is a concave function of the block's length [19,20]. As a matter of\nfact, some of the models considered here have F\u03b1 (x) \u2264 1,\nas well as Fv.N. (x) \u2264 0. This is rather surprising since in\nref. [14] it has been shown that the first order of the shortlength expansion of F\u03b1 (x), corresponding to the limit in\nwhich the distance between the blocks is much larger than\ntheir lengths, is positive. We will see that the two things\nare in fact compatible.\nThe key to our results lies in the non-locality of the\nfermionic mapping of spin- 12 chains. As discussed in\nref. [12], and then explained in detail in ref. [11], the entanglement of disjoint subsystems in the fermionic representation of non-interacting spin- 12 chains is different\nfrom that in the spin representation, because the JordanWigner transformation\n\nWe focus on chains that can be constructed by merging\nXX and Ising models, which we call \"constitutive models\".\nWe consider in particular the Hamiltonians\n\uf8f1\nP\n\u2212\nn\nz\nz\n\uf8f4\n* * * \u03c3l+n\u22121\n\u03c3l+n\n+ h.c.\n: l \u03c3l+ \u03c3l+1\n\uf8f2XX\nP x z\nn\nz\nx\n(5)\nIs\n: l \u03c3l \u03c3l+1 * * * \u03c3l+n\u22121 \u03c3l+n + \u03c3lz\n\uf8f4\nP x z\n\uf8f3\ny\nz\nz y\nx\nXX \u00d7 Is : l \u03c3l \u03c3l+1 \u03c3l+2 + \u03c32l\u22121 \u03c32l \u03c32l+1 + \u03c32l ,\nwhere the names (on the left) refer to the constituents:\nthe Hamiltonians are sum of XX and Ising models that act\non different fermionic degrees of freedom; the constitutive\nHamiltonians are obtained by restricting the sum in eq. (5)\nover the indices that have the same remainder after the\ndivision by the number n of sub-chains. The models in\neq. (5) can be solved by diagonalizing separately the n\ncommuting Hamiltonians. For example, by merging two\nquantum Ising models we eventually get\n\u0011\nX \u0010 \u2020\n(6)\nHIs2 =\n\u03b5k bk,e bk,e + b\u2020k,o bk,o \u2212 1 ,\nk\n\nwhere bk,e and bk,o are the Bogolioubov fermions that diagonalize the Ising model, constructed with the even and\nthe odd J-W fermions, respectively; \u03b5k \u2261 \u03b5k,e = \u03b5k,o is the\ndispersion relation. By looking at the low-energy excitations, we find that the dispersion relation is approximately\nlinear and the number of chiral modes (i.e. the number\nof zeros of the dispersion relation above the ground state)\nis equal to the sum of the chiral modes of the constituY\n\u03c3 x + i\u03c3ly\nc\u2020l =\n\u03c3jz \u03c3l+ ,\nwith \u03c3l+ = l\n,\n(3) tive models.

Igl\u00f3i and Peschel in ref. [12] have given a clear stitutive models. Thus, the long distance physics in the\nevidence of this fact by comparing the sub-lattice entangle- examples (5) is expected to be described by a CFT with\nment (e.g. the entanglement of the subsystem consisting central charge n, n2 , and 23 , respectively (c = 1 in the XX\nof all even sites) in the two representations: the entan- model and c = 21 in the Ising one).\nglement entropy, which is extensive in both cases, has a\nWe point out that all Hamiltonians with the same strucdifferent slope.

In order to\nrestore the correct algebra, we multiply the operators in s\nby az[s\u2032 ] if and only if the operators in s\u2032 are not multiplied\nby az[s] (this is the origin of the central product in eq. (8)).\nFinally, the inverse J-W transformation (the first product\nin eq. (8)) maps the Hamiltonian into the merged one.\nThe model obtained by merging n constitutive chains\nand the corresponding n-copy model have different entanglement features. We sum up firstly the properties of the\nn-copy model.\n\nwhich for non-interacting models are exponentials of\nquadratic forms. The first operator is the fermionic density matrix.

We derived the universal function\nF2 (x) for the XX and the Ising model, reproducing the\nknown results from CFT. In addition, we computed F2 (x)\nfor an entire class of chains that embody models with a\nfree-fermion representation. We have shown that F\u03b1 (x)\ncan be smaller than 1, as well as Fv.N. (x) negative, by\nproviding examples in which this indeed happens. Finally,\nwe revealed a correspondence between the XX model and\ntwo merged Ising chains, extending the analysis of ref. [21]\nto the entanglement of disjoint subsystems.\nIn this paper we considered \u03b1 = 2, however the analysis\nof R\u00e9nyi entropies with \u03b1 > 2 could be useful to understand the connection between the CFT formalism and the\nmethod of ref. [11], based on free-fermion techniques, perhaps making progress toward the problem of computing\nthe universal function Fv.N. (x) of the von Neumann entropy.\nIn light of the existence of models in which Fv.N. (x) < 0,\nit becomes worth determining the lower bound of the\nuniversal function, for example investigating the consequences of strong subadditivity [20].\nFinally, we have seen that the XX Hamiltonian commutes with the models embodying XX chains. However, it\ndoes not commute with the corresponding n-copy Hamiltonians. Thus, it could be interesting to study the features\nof the stationary state that describes the system late times\nafter the quench resulting from joining together the n decoupled XX sub-chains to form an XX chain.\n\n[1] Amico L., Fazio R., Osterloh A. and Vedral V., Rev.\nMod.
