To probe the vacuum of the Minskowski\nspacetime, that is, the Dirac sea of particle-antiparticle pairs, one has to turn on a strong\n(gauge) field and produce pairs of particle and antiparticle interacting with it. The vacuum\nstructure of a curved spacetime, on which laws of physics are formulated, becomes more\ncomplicated and intangible than the Minkowski one. Without quantum gravity at present,\nan effective field theory for gravity may be employed, where matter fields are quantized\non the background spacetime.\nIn this paper, we shall explore by a massive scalar field the vacuum structure of\nspacetime, in particular, a conformally, asymptotically flat spacetime and a de Sitter (dS)\nspacetime in four dimensions. As a few leading Feynman diagrams do not exhibit the\nvacuum structure, we need a nonperturbative method for the effective action in analogy\nwith quantum electrodynamics (QED). Heisenberg-Euler and Schwinger effective action,\nfor instance, probes the vacuum of Dirac sea of particle and antiparticle pairs by a strong\nexternal electromagnetic field [1, 2]. The Dirac sea will be explored by strong light sources\nin the near future [3].\nTo find the nonperturbative effective action for gravity, we shall work in the in-/outstate formalism from Schwinger's variational principle. The variational principle states\nthat either interactions or curved spacetimes may make the out-vacuum different from\nthe in-vacuum and the scattering matrix between the out- and the in-vacua provides the\neffective action [4]. Nikishov and DeWitt showed that the S-matrix could be entirely\ndetermined by the coefficient for the Bogoliubov transformation between the in- and the\nout-vacua [5, 6]. In other formulation one has to integrate the Feynman propagator in\nthe DeWitt-Schwinger representation with respect to mass squared to obtain the effective\naction (for review and references, see Ref. [7]).\nRecently, Kim, Lee and Yoon have further developed the in-/out-state formalism\nthrough the gamma function- or the \u0393-regularization and found the QED effective actions in strong electromagnetic fields that act for a finite period [8]. (For other attempts\nusing the gamma function, see Refs. [9, 10].) The \u0393-regularization has been elaborated to\nspatially localized electromagnetic fields [11], which require the tunneling boundary condition on the solution [5]. The new formalism has also been applied to dS space minimally\ncoupled to a massive scalar field and yielded the effective action in any dimensional dS\n[12], which is the gravitational analog of the Heisenberg-Euler/Schwinger effective action\nin QED for a constant electric field.\n2\n\n\fThe reason for studying the vacuum polarization (the real part of the effective action)\nof a conformally, asymptotically flat and a dS space is that firstly, these spacetimes allow one to explicitly find the Bogoliubov transformation and secondly, they suffer from\ninstability due to cosmic particle production, the so-called \"cosmic laser\" [13]. The main\ndifference from the earlier work, Ref. [12], is that we analyze the divergent and the convergent structures of the effective action for gravity in four dimensions only and interpret\nthe results from the view point of cosmology. The divergent terms are closely related\nwith renormalization of the vacuum energy, the gravitational constant and the one-loop\ncoupling constants.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the \u0393regularization for effective actions. In Section 3, we regularize and investigate the UV\nand the IR structures of Heisenberg-Euler/Schwinger effective action in scalar QED. We\nstudy the effective action for a conformally, asymptotically flat spacetime in Section 4 and\nfor a four dimensional dS space in Section 5 and interpret the divergent terms in terms of\nrenormalization of the cosmological constant, the gravitational constant and the coupling\nconstants of one-loop.\n\n2\n\n\u0393-Regularization for the In-/Out-State Formalism\n\nThe in-vacuum under the influence of an external field, such as a gauge field or a background spacetime, evolves to another one, which needs not necessarily the same as the\nin-vacuum, and settles in the out-vacuum when the external field acts for a finite period\nof time. This is true not only for QED in electromagnetic fields and but also for curved\nspacetimes, in particular, expanding spacetimes and black holes. Further, if the external\nfield produces particles (pairs), the in-vacuum suffers from instability and decays as (the\nupper/lower sign for bosons/fermions) [in units of c = h\u0304 = 1]\nh\n\n|h0, out|0, ini|2 = exp \u2213VT\n\nX\nK\n\ni\n\n(1 \u00b1 NK ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V is the space volume, T is the duration of the interaction, K denotes all quantum\nstates, and NK is the number of particles (pairs) produced for K. In the limit of infinite\nvolume or time, the out-vacuum is orthogonal to and unitarily inequivalent to the invacuum. Thus, we need the in-/out-state formalism for the effective action in background\nexternal fields.\nThe effective action, in principle, can be obtained from the generating functional in a\n\n3\n\n\fcurved spacetime\nZ[J] =\n\nZ\n\nh\n\nD[\u03c6] exp iSm [\u03c6] + i\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\ni\n\n\u2212gd4 xJ\u03c6 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c6 denotes a boson or fermion field, Sm [\u03c6] is the action for the field and J is a source.\nThe variational principle by Schwinger prescribes [4]\n\u03b4Z[0] = i\n\nZ\n\nD[\u03c6]\u03b4Sm [\u03c6]eiSm [\u03c6] = ih0, out|\u03b4Sm |0, ini,\n\n(3)\n\nand thereby the effective action as the S-matrix\neiW = h0, out|0, ini = Z[0].\n\n(4)\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor follows from varying W with respect to g \u03bc\u03bd . To compute\nthe effective action (4), one needs some method either for the path integral including\nparticles production or for the out-vacuum.\nSchwinger himself evaluated the path integral for a charged scalar or fermion in a\nconstant electromagnetic field and found the so-called Heisenberg-Euler/Schwinger effective action in the proper-time integral [2]. One prominent feature of the effective action\nis the imaginary part that determines the decay rate, as shown in eq. (1). The other\ninteresting property is the vacuum polarization, where the Minkowski vacuum becomes a\nmedium since the Dirac sea produces and annihilates the (virtual) pairs of particle and\nantiparticle. The effective action beyond constant electromagnetic fields has been an issue\nof extensive study in theoretical physics [14], which belongs to strong field physics, and\nwhere nonperturbative quantum effects are important.\nThe effective action for a massive field can also be found from the Feynman propagator\nin the DeWitt-Schwinger representation as [7]\nW =\n\ni\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nm2\n\ndm2\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212gd4 xGDS\nF (x, x).\n\n(5)\n\nThe resolvent method for the effective action in QED in a constant and a pulselike electric\nfield [15] and the Green function method for the Coulomb gauge [5] is a variation of this\nmethod. Nikishov and DeWitt showed that the effective action could be expressed in\nterms of the Bogoliubov coefficients (the upper/lower sign for bosons/fermions) as [5, 6]\nZ\nX\n\u221a\nW =\n\u2212gd4 xLeff = \u2212i ln(h0, out|0, ini) = \u00b1i(VT )\nln(\u03bc\u2217K ),\n(6)\nK\n\nsince the out-vacuum is related to the in-vacuum through the Bogoliubov transformation\nfor the bosons/fermions interacting the external field\n\u2217 \u2020\naout,K = \u03bcK ain,K + \u03bdK\nain,K .\n\n4\n\n(7)\n\n\fThese coefficients satisfy the relation for each K\n|\u03bcK |2 \u00b1 |\u03bdK |2 = 1,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich follows from the commutation/anticommutation relation for bosons/fermions or\nspin-statistics theorem. The effective action (6) even after renormalization constrains the\nvacuum persistence (twice of the imaginary part) and the number of produced particles\n(pairs), NK = |\u03bdK |2 , as [8, 11, 16, 17]\nX\n\n2Im(Leff ) = \u00b1\n\nK\n\nln(1 \u00b1 NK ).\n\n(9)\n\nThe key idea of the gamma function- or the \u0393-regularization is that most of known\nsolutions for free fields in background fields can be expressed in the hypergeometric function, whose connection formula in two regions determines the Bogoliubov coefficients as\na rational function of gamma functions with complex arguments, and that the logarithm\nof the gamma function [18],\nln \u0393(\u03b1 \u00b1 i\u03b2) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e h e\u2212(\u03b1\u00b1i\u03b2)z\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212z\n\n\u2212\n\ni\ne\u2212z\n\u2212z dz\n+\n(\u03b1\n\u00b1\ni\u03b2\n\u2212\n1)e\n,\n1 \u2212 e\u2212z\nz\n\n(10)\n\nhas an analytic continuation in the complex plane and the residue theorem determines\nthe imaginary part. The second and the third terms are to be regulated away through\nrenormalization.

The term cos(s/2) is independent of quantum\nexcitation l and subtracts the background geometry. It is interesting to compare eq.\n(41) with the effective actions from the propagator method (5), which do not have the\nimaginary part [21, 22, 23].\nThe momentum integral (13) or (29) is now replaced by the angular momentum sum\ndue to the spherical symmetry of dS space. Though the proper-time integral is finite for\neach fixed l, the summation over angular momenta is infinite. The divergent structure\nof the effective action requires a regularization scheme, for instance, the \u03b6-regularization,\nP\u221e 2\nl=1 l = \u03b6(\u22122) = 0, which removes the imaginary part and the subtraction of the\nbackground geometry, as shown in Ref.

Finally, the vacuum polarization takes the form\nLeff (R) = \u2212\u03ba(0, 2)P\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nds \u2212\u03b3s h cos( 2s ) i\ne\n.\ns\nsin( 2s )\n\n(44)\n\nAs \u03ba(0, 2) = \u03b6(\u22122) = 0, the effective action vanishes for dS space in D = 4, implying no\nquantum hair and confirming the result of Ref. [12].\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have explored the vacuum structure of a conformally, asymptotically flat spacetime\nand a de Sitter spacetime in D = 4. The gamma function or the \u0393-regularization has\nbeen used to provide effective actions not only for QED but also for gravity. The key idea\nis to regularize the logarithm of gamma functions for the effective action that is expressed\nin terms of the Bogoliubov coefficient. Remarkably, the effective action for gravity takes\na similar form as the Heisenberg-Euler and Schwinger one for QED. We have analyzed\nthe UV and the IR structures of the effective action for gravity. The divergent terms\nare closely related with renormalization of the vacuum energy, the gravitational constant\nand the one-loop coupling constants. One surprising result is that the de Sitter space in\nD = 4 does not have any quantum hair due the maximal symmetry of spacetime [12].\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank W-Y.
