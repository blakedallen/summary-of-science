We give an informal introduction to formal and rigid geometry,\nand we discuss some applications in algebraic and arithmetic geometry and\nsingularity theory, with special emphasis on recent applications to the Milnor\nfibration and the motivic zeta function by J. Sebag and the author.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet R be a complete discrete valuation ring, with quotient field K, and residue\nfield k. We choose a uniformizing parameter \u03c0, i.e. \u03c0 generates the unique maximal\nideal of R. Geometers may take R = C[[t]], the ring of formal power series over the\ncomplex numbers, with K = C((t)), k = C, \u03c0 = t, while number theorists might\nprefer to think of R = Zp , the ring of p-adic integers, with K = Qp , k = Fp , \u03c0 = p.\nVery roughly, a formal scheme over R consists of an algebraic variety over k,\ntogether with algebraic information on an infinitesimal neighbourhood of this varib in a\nety. If X is a variety over R, we can associate to X its formal completion X\nnatural way. It is a formal scheme over R, and can be seen as an infinitesimal tubular neighbourhood of the special fiber X0 in X. Its underlying topological space\ncoincides with the space underlying X0 , but additional infinitesimal information is\nb\ncontained in the sheaf of regular functions on X.\nb is the following phenomenon. A\nAn important aspect of the formal scheme X\nclosed point x on the scheme-theoretic generic fiber of X over K has coordinates\nin some finite extension of the field K, and (unless X is proper over R) there is\nno natural way to associate to the point x a point of the special fiber X0 /k by\nb we can\nreduction modulo \u03c0. However, by inverting \u03c0 in the structure sheaf of X,\nb\nassociate a generic fiber X\u03b7 to the formal scheme X, which is a rigid variety over\nK. Rigid geometry provides a satisfactory theory of analytic geometry over nonarchimedean fields. A point on X\u03b7 has coordinates in the ring of integers of some\nfinite extension K \u2032 of K: if we denote by R\u2032 the normalization of R in K \u2032 , we\nb \u2032 ). By reduction modulo \u03c0, we obtain a\ncan canonically identify X\u03b7 (K \u2032 ) with X(R\ncanonical \"contraction\" of the generic fiber X\u03b7 to the special fiber X0 . Roughly\nb has the advantage that its generic and its special\nspeaking, the formal scheme X\nfiber are tightly connected, and what glues them together are the R\u2032 -sections on\nX, where R\u2032 runs over the finite extensions of R.\nA main disadvantage of rigid geometry is the artificial nature of the topology\non rigid varieties: it is not a classical topology, but a Grothendieck topology. In\nthe nineties, Berkovich developed his spectral theory of non-archimedean spaces.\nHis spaces carry a true topology, which allows to apply classical techniques from\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJOHANNES NICAISE\n\nalgebraic topology. In particular, the unit disc R becomes connected by arcs, while\nit is totally disconnected w.r.t. its \u03c0-adic topology.\nIn Section 3, we give a brief survey of the basic theory of formal schemes, and\nSection 4 is a crash course on rigid geometry. Section 5 contains the basic defnitions\nof Berkovich' approach to non-archimedean geometry. In the final Section 6, we\nbriefly discuss some applications of the theory, with special emphasis on the relation\nwith arc spaces of algebraic varieties, and the Milnor fibration.\nThis intuitive introduction merely aims to provide some insight into the theory\nof formal schemes and rigid varieties. We do not provide proofs; instead, we chose\nto give a list of more thorough introductions to the different topics dealt with in\nthis note.\n2. Conventions and notation\n\u2022 For any field F , we denote by F alg an algebraic closure, and by F s the\nseparable closure of F in F alg .\n\u2022 If S is any scheme, a S-variety is a separated reduced scheme of finite type\nover S.\n\u2022 For any locally ringed space (site) X, we denote the underlying topological\nspace (site) by |X|.\n\u2022 Throughout this note, R denotes a complete discrete valuation ring, with\nresidue field k, and quotient field K. We fix a uniformizing parameter \u03c0,\ni.e. a generator of the maximal ideal of R. For any integer n \u2265 0, we\ndenote by Rn the quotient ring R/(\u03c0 n+1 ). A finite extension R\u2032 of R is by\ndefinition the normalization of R in some finite field extension K \u2032 of K; R\u2032\nis again a complete discrete valuation ring.\n\u2022 Once we fix a value |\u03c0| \u2208]0, 1[, the discrete valuation v on K defines a nonarchimedean absolute value |.| on K, with |z| = |\u03c0|v(z) for z \u2208 K \u2217 . This\nabsolute value induces a topology on K, called the \u03c0-adic topology. The\nideals \u03c0 n R, n \u2265 0, form a fundamental system of open neighbourhoods of\nthe zero element in K. The \u03c0-adic topology is totally disconnected. The\nabsolute value on K extends uniquely to an absolute value on K alg . For any\ninteger m > 0, we endow (K alg )m with the norm kzk := maxi=1,...,m |zi |.\n3. Formal geometry\nIn this note, we will only consider formal schemes topologically of finite type\nover the complete discrete valuation ring R. This case is in many respects simpler\nthan the general one, but it serves our purposes. For a more thorough introduction\nto the theory of formal schemes, we refer to [23, \u00a710], [22, no. 182], [28], or [9].\nIntuitively, a formal scheme X\u221e over R consists of its special fiber X0 , which is\na scheme of finite type over k, endowed with a structure sheaf containing additional\nalgebraic information on an infinitesimal neighbourhood of X0 .\n3.1. Affine formal schemes. For any tuple of variables x = (x1 , . . . , xm ), we\ndefine a R-algebra R{x} as the projective limit\nR{x} := lim\nRn [x]\n\u2190\u2212\nn\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n3\n\nThe R-algebra R{x} is canonically isomorphic to the algebra of converging power\nseries over R, i.e. the subalgebra of R[[x]] consisting of the elements\n\nc(x) =\n\nX\n\ni=(i1 ,...,im )\u2208Nm\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed ci\n\nm\nY\n\nj=1\n\ni\n\n\uf8f6\n\nxjj \uf8f8 \u2208 R[[x]]\n\nsuch that ci \u2192 0 (w.r.t. the \u03c0-adic topology on K) as |i| = i1 + . . . + im tends to \u221e.\nThis means that for each n \u2208 N, there exists a value i0 \u2208 N such that ci is divisible\nby \u03c0 n in R if |i| > i0 . Note that this is exactly the condition which guarantees\nthat the images of c(x) in the quotient rings Rn [[x]] are actually polynomials, i.e.\nbelong to Rn [x]. The algebra R{x} can also be characterized as the sub-algebra\nof R[[x]] consisting of those power series which converge on the closed unit disc\nRm = {z \u2208 K m | kzk \u2264 1}, since an infinite sum converges in a non-archimedean\nfield iff its terms tend to zero. One can show that R{x} is Noetherian [23, 0.(7.5.4)].\nAn R-algebra A is called topologically of finite type (tf t) over R, if it is isomorphic\nto an algebra of the form R{x1 , . . . , xm }/I, for some integer m > 0 and some ideal\nI. For any integer n \u2265 0, we denote by An the quotient ring A/(\u03c0 n+1 ). It is a\nRn -algebra of finite type. Then A is the limit of the projective system (An )n\u2208N , and\nif we endow each ring An with the discrete topology, then A becomes a topological\nring w.r.t. the limit topology (the \u03c0-adic topology on A). By definition, the ideals\n\u03c0 n A, n > 0, form a fundamental system of open neighbourhoods of the zero element\nof A.\nTo any tf t R-algebra A, we can associate a ringed space Spf A. It is defined as\nthe direct limit\nSpf A := lim\nSpec An\n\u2212\u2192\nn\n\nin the category of topologically ringed spaces (where the topology on OSpec An is\ndiscrete for every n), so the structure sheaf OSpf A is a sheaf of topological Ralgebras in a natural way. Moreover, one can show that the stalks of this structure\nsheaf are local rings. A tf t affine formal R-scheme is a locally topologically ringed\nspace in R-algebras which is isomorphic to a space of the form Spf A.\nNote that the transition morphisms Spec Am \u2192 Spec An , m \u2264 n, are nilpotent immersions and therefore homeomorphisms. Hence, the underlying topological\nspace |Spf A| of Spf A is the set of open prime ideals J of A (i.e. prime ideals containing \u03c0), endowed with the Zariski topology, and it is canonically homeomorphic\nto |Spec A0 |.\nSo we see that Spf A is the locally topologically ringed space in R-algebras\n(|Spec A0 |, lim\nOSpec An )\n\u2190\u2212\nn\n\nIn particular, we have OSpf A (Spf A) = A. Whenever f is an element of A, we\ndenote by D(f ) the set of open prime ideals of A which do not contain f . This\nis an open subset of |Spf A|, and the ring of sections OSpf A (D(f )) is the \u03c0-adic\ncompletion A{f } of the localization Af .\n\n\f4\n\nJOHANNES NICAISE\n\nA morphism between tf t affine formal R-schemes is by definition a morphism\nof locally ringed spaces in R-algebras1. If h : A \u2192 B is a morphism of tf t Ralgebras, then h induces a direct system of morphisms of R-schemes Spec Bn \u2192\nSpec An and by passage to the limit a morphism of tf t affine formal R-schemes\nSpf (h) : Spf B \u2192 Spf A. The resulting functor Spf induces an equivalence between\nthe opposite category of tf t R-algebras, and the category of tf t affine formal Rschemes, just like in the algebraic scheme case.\nThe special fiber X0 of the affine formal R-scheme X\u221e = Spf A is the k-scheme\nX0 = Spec A0 . As we've seen, the natural morphism of topologically locally ringed\nspaces X0 \u2192 X\u221e is a homeomorphism.\nExample 1. Any finite extension R\u2032 of R is a tf t R-algebra. The affine formal\nscheme Spf R\u2032 consists of a single point, corresponding to the maximal ideal of R\u2032 ,\nbut the ring of sections on this point is the entire ring R\u2032 . So in some sense the\ninfinitesimal information in the topology of Spec R\u2032 (the generic point) is transferred\nto the structure sheaf of Spf R\u2032 .\nIf A = R{x, y}/(\u03c0 \u2212 xy) and X\u221e = Spf A, then as a topological space X\u221e\ncoincides with its special fiber X0 = Spec k[x, y]/(xy), but the structure sheaf of\nX\u221e is much \"thicker\" than the one of X0 . The formal R-scheme X\u221e should be\nseen as an infinitesimal tubular neighbourhood around X0 .\n3.2. Formal schemes. A formal scheme X\u221e topologically of finite type (tf t) over\nR is a locally topologically ringed space in R-algebras, which has a finite open cover\nby tf t affine formal R-schemes. A morphism between tf t formal R-schemes is a\nmorphism of locally ringed spaces in R-algebras.\nIt is often convenient to describe X\u221e in terms of the direct system (Xn :=\nX\u221e \u00d7R Rn )n\u22650 . The locally ringed space Xn is a scheme of finite type over Rn ,\nfor any n; if X\u221e = Spf A, then Xn = Spec An . For any pair of integers 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n,\nthe natural map of Rn -schemes um,n : Xm \u2192 Xn induces an isomorphism of Rm schemes Xm \u223c\n= Xn \u00d7Rn Rm . The scheme X0 is called the special fiber of X\u221e , and Xn\nis the n-th infinitesimal neighborhood of X0 in X\u221e (or \"thickening\"). The natural\nmorphism of locally topologically ringed spaces Xn \u2192 X\u221e is a homeomorphism for\neach n \u2265 0.\nConversely, if (Xn )n\u22650 is a direct system of R-schemes of finite type such that\n\u03c0 n+1 = 0 on Xn and such that the transition morphism um,n : Xm \u2192 Xn induces\nan isomorphism of Rm -schemes Xm \u223c\n= Xn \u00d7Rn Rm for each 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n, then this\ndirect system determines a tf t formal R-scheme X\u221e by putting\nX\u221e := lim\nXn\n\u2212\u2192\nn\n\nas a locally topologically ringed space in R-algebras.\nIn the same way, giving a morphism f : X\u221e \u2192 Y\u221e between tf t formal Rschemes amounts to giving a series of morphisms (fn : Xn \u2192 Yn )n\u22650 , where fn is\na morphism of Rn -schemes, and all the squares\n1Such a morphism is automatically continuous w.r.t. the topology on the structure sheaves,\nsince it maps \u03c0 to itself; because the topology is the \u03c0-adic one, it is determined by the R-algebra\nstructure. This is specific to so-called R-adic formal schemes and does not hold for more general\nformal R-schemes.\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\nXm \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nfm y\n\n5\n\nXn\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6f\nyn\n\nYm \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Yn\n\ncommute. In other words, a morphism of tf t formal R-schemes consists of a compatible system of morphisms between all the infinitesimal neighbourhoods of the\nspecial fibers.\nThe formal scheme X\u221e is called separated if the scheme Xn is separated for each\nn. In fact, this will be the case as soon as the special fiber X0 is separated. We\nwill work in the category of separated formal schemes, topologically of finite type\nover R; we'll call these objects stf t formal R-schemes.\nA stf t formal scheme X\u221e over R is flat if its structure sheaf has no \u03c0-torsion.\nA typical example of a non-flat stf t formal R-scheme is one with an irreducible\ncomponent concentrated in the special fiber. A flat stf t formal R-scheme can be\nthought of as a continuous family of schemes over the inifintesimal disc Spf R. Any\nstf t formal R-scheme has a maximal flat closed formal subscheme, obtained by\nkilling \u03c0-torsion.\n3.3. Coherent modules. Let A be a tf t R-algebra. An A-module N is coherent\niff it is finitely generated. Any such module N defines a sheaf of modules on Spf A\nin the usual way. A coherent sheaf of modules N on a stf t formal R-scheme X\u221e\nis obtained by gluing coherent modules on affine open formal subschemes.\nA more convenient description is the following: the category of coherent sheaves\nN on X\u221e is equivalent to the category of direct systems (Nn )n\u22650 , where Nn is a\ncoherent sheaf on the scheme Xn , and the OXn -linear transition map vm,n : Nm \u2192\nNn induces an isomorphism of coherent OXm -modules Nm \u223c\n= u\u2217m,n Nn for any pair\nm \u2264 n. Morphisms between such systems are defined in the obvious way.\n3.4. The completion functor. Let X be any Noetherian scheme and J a coherent ideal sheaf on X, and denote by V (J ) the closed subscheme of X defined by\n[ of X is the limit of the direct system of schemes\nJ . The J -adic completion X/J\nn\n(V (J ))n>0 in the category of topologically ringed spaces (where OV (J n ) carries\nthe discrete topology). This is, in fact, a formal scheme, but in general not of\nthe kind we have defined before; we include the construction here for later use. If\nh : Y \u2192 X is a morphism of Noetherian schemes, and if we denote by K the inverse\nimage J OY of J on Y , then h defines a direct system of morphisms of schemes\nV (Kn ) \u2192 V (J n ) and by passage to the limit a morphism of topologically locally\n[ , called the J -adic completion of h.\nringed spaces Yd\n/K \u2192 X/J\nIf X is a separated R-scheme of finite type and J is the ideal generated by \u03c0, then\nthe J -adic completion of X is the limit of the direct system (Xn = X \u00d7R Rn )n\u22650 ,\nb It is called the\nand this is a stf t formal R-scheme which we denote simply by X.\nformal (\u03c0-adic) completion of the R-scheme X. Its special fiber X0 is canonically\nisomorphic to the fiber of X over the closed point of Spec R. The formal scheme\nb is flat iff X is flat over R. Intuitively, X\nb should be seen as the infinitesimal\nX\ntubular neighbourhood of X0 in X. As a topological space, it coincides with X0 ,\nbut additional infinitesimal information is contained in the structure sheaf.\n\n\f6\n\nJOHANNES NICAISE\n\nb\nExample 2. If X = Spec R[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(f1 , . . . , fl ), then its formal completion X\nis simply Spf R{x1 , . . . , xn }/(f1 , . . . , fl ).\nBy the above construction, a morphism of separated R-schemes of finite type\nb \u2192 Yb between the\nf : X \u2192 Y induces a morphism of formal R-schemes f\u02c6 : X\nformal \u03c0-adic completions of X and Y .

It is a bijection, however, if X is proper over R: this\nis a corollary of Grothendieck's Existence Theorem; see [24, 5.4.1]. In particular,\nthe completion map induces a bijection between R\u2032 -sections of X, and R\u2032 -sections\nb (i.e. morphisms of formal R-schemes Spf R\u2032 \u2192 X),\nb for any finite extension R\u2032\nof X\nof the complete discrete valuation ring R. Indeed: Spec R\u2032 is a finite, hence proper\nR-scheme, and its formal \u03c0-adic completion is Spf R\u2032 .\nExample 3.

This system defines a coherent sheaf of modules N\nb\nover R, it follows from Grothendieck's Existence Theorem that the functor N \u2192 N\nis an equivalence between the category of coherent OX -modules and the category\nof coherent OXb -modules [24, 5.1.6]. Moreover, there is a canonical isomorphism\nb N\nb) \u223c\nH q (X,\n= H q (X, N ) for each coherent OX -module N and each q \u2265 0.\nIf a stf t formal R-scheme Y\u221e is isomorphic to the \u03c0-adic completion Yb of a\nseparated R-scheme Y of finite type, we call the formal scheme Y\u221e algebrizable,\nwith algebraic model Y . The following theorem is the main criterion to recognize\nalgebrizable formal schemes [24, 5.4.5]: if Y\u221e is proper over R, and L is an invertible\nOY\u221e -bundle such that the pull-back L0 of L to Y0 is ample, then Y\u221e is algebrizable.\nMoreover, the algebraic model Y for Y\u221e is unique up to canonical isomorphism,\nc and M is ample. For an\nthere exists a unique line bundle M on Y with L = M,\nexample of a proper formal C[[t]]-scheme which is not algebrizable, see [28, 5.24(b)].\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n7\n\n3.5. Formal blow-ups. Let X\u221e be a flat stf t formal R-scheme, and let I be\na coherent ideal sheaf on X\u221e such that I contains a power of the uniformizing\nparameter \u03c0. We can define the formal blow-up of X\u221e at the center I as follows\n[13, \u00a7 2]: if X\u221e = Spf A is affine, and I is the ideal of global sections of I on X\u221e ,\nthen the formal blow-up of X\u221e at I is the \u03c0OSpec A -adic completion of the blow-up\nof Spec A at I. The general case is obtained by gluing.\nThe formal blow-up of X\u221e at I is again a flat stf t formal R-scheme,and the\ncomposition of two formal blow-ups is again a formal blow-up [13, 2.1+2.5]. If X is\na separated R-scheme of finite type and I is a coherent ideal sheaf on X containing\nb at Ib is canonically isomorphic to the\na power of \u03c0, then the formal blow-up of X\n\u03c0-adic completion of the blow-up of X at I.\n4. Rigid geometry\nIn this note, we'll only be able to cover the basics of rigid geometry. We refer\nthe reader to the books [10, 20] and the research papers [8, 13, 37, 40] for a more\nthorough introduction. A nice survey on Tate's approach to rigid geometry can be\nfound in [30].\n4.1. Analytic geometry over non-Archimedean fields. Let L be a non-archimedean\nfield (i.e. a field which is complete w.r.t. an absolute value which satisfies the ultrametric property); we assume that the absolute value on L is non-trivial. For\ninstance, if K is our complete discretely valued field, then we can turn K into a\nnon-archimedean field by fixing a value |\u03c0| \u2208]0, 1[ and putting |x| = |\u03c0|v(x) for\nx \u2208 K \u2217 , where v denotes the discrete valuation on K (by convention, v(0) = \u221e\nand |0| = 0).\nThe absolute value on L extends uniquely to any finite extension of L, and hence\nalg the completion of Lalg , and by L\ncs the closure of\nto Ls and Lalg . We denote by Ld\ns\nd\nalg\nL in L ; these are again non-archimedean fields. We denote by Lo the valuation\ne the\nring {x \u2208 L | |x| \u2264 1}, by Loo its maximal ideal {x \u2208 L | |x| < 1}, and by L\no\noo\no\noo\ne\nresidue field L /L . For L = K we have L = R, L = (\u03c0) and L = k.\nSince L is endowed with an absolute value, one can use this structure to develop\na theory of analytic varieties over L by mimicing the construction over C. Na\u0131\u0308vely,\nwe can define analytic functions on open subsets of Ln as L-valued functions which\nare locally defined by a converging power series with coefficients in L. However,\nwe are immediately confronted with some pathological phenomena. Consider, for\ninstance, the p-adic unit disc\nZp = {x \u2208 Qp | |x| \u2264 1}\nThe partition\n{p Zp , 1 + p Zp , . . . , (p \u2212 1) + p Zp }\n\nis an open cover of Zp w.r.t. the p-adic topology. Hence, the characteristic function of p Zp is analytic, according to our na\u0131\u0308ve definition. This contradicts some\nelementary properties that one expects an analytic function to have. The cause of\nthis and similar pathologies, is the fact that the unit disc Zp is totally disconnected\nwith respect to the p-adic topology. In this approach, there are \"too many\" analytic functions, and \"too few\" analytic varieties (for instance, with this definition,\nany compact p-adic manifold is isomorphic to a disjoint union of i unit discs, with\ni \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1} its Serre invariant [39]).\n\n\f8\n\nJOHANNES NICAISE\n\nRigid geometry is as a more refined approach to non-Archimedean analytic geometry, turning the unit disc into a connected space. Rigid spaces are endowed\nwith a certain Grothendieck topology, only allowing a special type of covers.\nWe'll indicate two possible approaches to the theory of rigid varieties over L.\nThe first one is due to Tate [40], the second one to Raynaud [37]. If we return to\nour example of the p-adic unit disc Zp , Tate's construction can be understood as\nfollows. In fact, we already know what the \"correct\" algebra of analytic functions\non Zp should be: the power series with coefficients in K which converge globally on\nZp . Tate's idea is to start from this algebra, and then to construct a space on which\nthese functions naturally live. This is similar to the construction of the spectrum\nof a ring in algebraic geometry. Raynaud observed that a certain class of Tate's\nrigid varieties can be characterized in terms of formal schemes.\n4.2. Tate algebras. The basic objects in Tate's theory are the algebras of converging power series over L\nTm = L{x1 , . . . , xm } = {\u03b1 =\n\nX\n\ni\u2208Nm\n\n(\u03b1i\n\nm\nY\n\nj=1\n\ni\n\nxjj ) \u2208 L[[x1 , . . . , xm ]] | |\u03b1i | \u2192 0 as |i| \u2192 \u221e}\n\nPm\n\nwhere |i| = j=1 ij . The convergence condition implies in particular that for each\n\u03b1 there exists i0 \u2208 N such that for |i| > i0 the coefficient \u03b1i belongs to Lo . The\nalgebra Tm is the algebra of power series over L which converge on the closed unit\npolydisc (Lo )m in Lm (since an infinite sum converges in a non-archimedean field\niff its terms tend to zero). Note that, for L = K, Tm \u223c\n= R{x1 , . . . , xm } \u2297R K.\nAnalogously, we can define an algebra of converging power series B{x1 , . . . , xm }\nfor any Banach algebra B. The algebra Tm is a Banach algebra for the sup-norm\nkf ksup = maxi |\u03b1i |. It is Noetherian, and any ideal I is closed, so that the quotient\nTm /I is again a Banach algebra w.r.t. the residue norm.\nA Tate algebra, or L-affinoid algebra, is a L-algebra A isomorphic to such a\nquotient Tm /I. The residue norm on A depends on the presentation A \u223c\n= Tm /I.\nHowever, any morphism of L-algebras Tm /I \u2192 Tm /J is automatically continuous,\nso in particular, the residue norm on A is well-defined up to equivalence, and the\ninduced topology on A is independent of the chosen presentation. For any maximal\nideal y of A, the residue field A/y is a finite extension of L. For proofs of all these\nfacts, we refer to [20, 3.2.1].\nBy Proposition 1 of [10, 7.1.1], the maximal ideals y of Tm correspond bijectively\nto G(Lalg /L)-orbits of tuples (z1 , . . . , zm ), with zi \u2208 (Lalg )o , via the map\ny 7\u2192 {(\u03c6(x1 ), . . . , \u03c6(xm )) | \u03c6 : Tm /y \u0592\u2192 Lalg }\nwhere \u03c6 runs through the L-embeddings of Tm /y in Lalg . In particular, for any\nmorphism of L-algebras \u03c8 : Tm \u2192 Lalg and any index i, the element \u03c8(xi ) belongs\nto (Lalg )o . It follows that \u03c8 is contractive, in the sense that |\u03c8(a)| \u2264 kaksup for\nany a in Tm .\nThe fact that we obtain tuples of elements in (Lalg )o , rather than Lalg , might\nlook strange at first; it is one of the most characteristic properties of Tate's rigid\nvarieties. Let us consider an elementary example. If z is an element of L, then x \u2212 z\no\nis invertible in L{x} iff z does not belong to LP\n. Indeed, for z 6= 0 the coefficients\nof the formal power series 1/(x \u2212 z) = \u2212(1/z) i\u22650 (x/z)i tend zo zero iff |z| > 1,\ni.e. iff z \u2208\n/ Lo . So (x \u2212 z) only defines a maximal ideal in L{x} if z \u2208 Lo .\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n9\n\n4.3. Affinoid spaces. The category of L-affinoid spaces is by definition the opposite category of the category of Tate algebras over L. For any L-affinoid space\nX, we'll denote the corresponding Tate algebra by A(X), and we call it the algebra\nof analytic functions on X. Conversely, for any Tate algebra A, we denote the\ncorresponding affinoid space by Sp A (some authors use the notation Spm instead).\nFor any m \u2265 0, the affinoid space Sp Tm is called the closed unit disc of dimension\nm over L.\nTo any L-affinoid space X = Sp A, we associate the set X \u266d of maximal ideals\nof the Tate algebra A = A(X). If we present A as a quotient Tm /(f1 , . . . , fn ),\nthen elements of (Sp A)\u266d correspond bijectively to G(Lalg /L)-orbits of tuples z =\n(z1 , . . . , zm ), with zi \u2208 (Lalg )o , and fj (z) = 0 for each j. In particular, if L is\nalgebraically closed and X is the closed unit disc Sp T1 , then\nX \u266d = Lo = {x \u2208 L | |x| \u2264 1}\n\nWe've seen above that, for any maximal ideal x of A, the quotient A/x is a finite\nextension of L, so it carries a unique prolongation of the absolute value |.| on L.\nHence, for any f \u2208 A and any x \u2208 (Sp A)\u266d , we can speak of the value f (x) of f at\nx (the image of f in A/x), and its absolute value |f (x)|. In this way, elements of A\nare viewed as functions on (Sp A)\u266d . Note that, if x is a prime ideal of A, there is in\ngeneral no canonical way to extend the absolute value on L to the extension A/x.\nThis is one of the reasons for working with the maximal spetrum (Sp A)\u266d , rather\nthan the prime spectrum Spec A. In Berkovich' theory (Section 5) the notion of\npoint is generalized by admitting any prime ideal x and specifying an extension of\nthe absolute value on L to A/x.\nThe spectral semi-norm on A is defined by\nkf ksup := sup |f (x)|\nx\u2208X \u266d\n\nIt is a norm iff A is reduced. By the maximum modulus principle [10, 6.2.1.4], this\nsupremum is, in fact, a maximum, i.e. there is a point x in X \u266d with |f (x)| = kf ksup .\nMoreover, for A = Tm , this definition concides with the one in the previous section,\nby [10, 5.1.4.6].\nIf \u03c6 : A \u2192 B is a morphism of L-affinoid algebras, then for any maximal ideal x\nin B, \u03c6\u22121 (x) is a maximal ideal in A, since B/x is a finite extension of L. Hence,\nany morphism of L-affinoid spaces h : X \u2192 Y induces a map h\u266d : X \u266d \u2192 Y \u266d on\nthe associated sets. A morphism of L-affinoid spaces h : X \u2192 Y is called a closed\nimmersion if the corresponding morphism of L-affinoid algebras A(Y ) \u2192 A(X) is\nsurjective.\nWe could try to endow X \u266d with the inital topology w.r.t. the functions x 7\u2192\n|f (x)|, where f varies in A. If L is algebraically closed and if we identify (Sp L{x})\u266d\nwith Lo , then this topology is simply the topology on Lo defined by the absolute\nvalue. It is totally disconnected, so it does not have the nice properties we are\nlooking for.\n4.4. Open covers. A morphism h : Y \u2192 X of L-affinoid spaces is called an\nopen immersion, if it satisfies the following universal property: for any morphism\ng : Z \u2192 X of L-affinoid spaces such that the image of g \u266d is contained in the image\nof h\u266d in X \u266d , there is a unique morphism g \u2032 : Z \u2192 Y such that g = h \u25e6 g \u2032 . If h\nis an open immersion, the image D of h\u266d in X \u266d is called an affinoid domain. One\ncan show that the map h\u266d is always injective [10, 7.2.2.1], so it identifies the set D\n\n\f10\n\nJOHANNES NICAISE\n\nwith Y \u266d . The L-affinoid space Y and the open immersion h : Y \u2192 X are uniquely\ndetermined by the affinoid domain D, up to canonical isomorphism. With slight\nabuse of notation, we will identify the affinoid domain D with the L-affinoid space\nY , so that we can think of an affinoid domain as an affinoid space sitting inside X,\nand we can speak of the Tate algebra A(D) of analytic functions on D. If E is a\nsubset of D, then E is an affinoid domain in D iff it is an affinoid domain in X.\nIn this case, the universal property yields a restriction map A(D) \u2192 A(E). The\nintersection of two affinoid domains is again an affinoid domain, but this does not\nalways hold for their union. If h : Z \u2192 X is a morphism of L-affinoid spaces, then\nthe inverse image of an affinoid domain in X is an affinoid domain in Z .\nExample 4. Consider the closed unit disc X = Sp L{x}. For a \u2208 Lo and r in the\nvalue group |L\u2217 |, we denote by D(a, r) the \"closed disc\" {z \u2208 X \u266d | |x(z) \u2212 a| \u2264 r},\nand by D\u2212 (a, r) the \"open disc\" {z \u2208 X \u266d | |x(z)\u2212a| < r}. We will see below that the\ndisc D(a, r) is an affinoid domain in X, with A(D(a, r)) = L{x, T }/(x \u2212 a \u2212 \u03c1T ),\nwhere \u03c1 is any element of L with |\u03c1| = r. On the other hand, the disc D\u2212 (a, r)\ncan not be an affinoid domain in X, since the function |x(.) \u2212 a| does not reach its\nmaximum on D\u2212 (a, r).\nAssume now that L is algebraically closed. By Theorem 2 in [10, 9.7.2] the\naffinoid domains in X are the finite disjoint unions of subsets of the form\nD(a0 , r0 ) \\ \u222aqi=1 D\u2212 (ai , ri )\nwith ai in Lo and ri in |L\u2217 |\u2229]0, 1] for i = 0, . . . , q.\nAn affinoid cover of X is a finite set of open immersions ui : Ui \u2192 X such\nthat the images of the maps (ui )\u266d cover X \u266d . A special kind of affinoid covers is\nconstructed as follows: take analytic functions f1 , . . . , fn in A(X), and suppose\nthat these elements generate the unit ideal A(X). Consider, for each i = 1, . . . , n,\nthe L-affinoid space Ui given by\nA(Ui ) = A(X){T1 , . . . , Tn }/(fj \u2212 Tj fi )j=1,...,n\nThe obvious morphism ui : Ui \u2192 X is an open immersion, and Ui is called a\nrational subspace of X. The image of (ui )\u266d is the set of points x of X \u266d such that\n|fi (x)| \u2265 |fj (x)| for j = 1, . . . , n. Indeed: using the fact that a morphism of Lalgebras Tm \u2192 Lalg is contractive (Section 4.2), and the assumption that f1 , . . . , fn\ngenerate A(X), one shows that a morphism of L-algebras \u03c8 : A(X) \u2192 Lalg factors\nthrough a morphism of L-algebras \u03c8i : A(Ui ) \u2192 Lalg iff \u03c8(fi ) 6= 0 and \u03c8(Tj ) =\n\u03c8(fj )/\u03c8(fi ) belongs to (Lalg )o , i.e. |\u03c8(fj )| \u2264 |\u03c8(fi )|. In this case, \u03c8i is unique.\nThe set of morphisms {u1 , . . . , un } is an affinoid cover, and is called a standard\ncover. It is a deep result that any affinoid domain of X is a finite union of rational\nsubsets of X, and any affinoid cover of X can be refined by a standard cover [10,\n7.3.5.3+8.2.2.2].\nOne of the cornerstones in the theory of rigid varieties is Tate's Acyclicity\nTheorem [10, 8.2.1.1]. It states that analytic functions on any affinoid cover\n{ui : Ui \u2192 X}i\u2208I satisfy the gluing property: the sequence\nY\nY\nA(Ui \u2229 Uj )\nA(X) \u2192\nA(Ui ) \u21c9\ni\u2208I\n\nis exact.\n\n(i,j)\u2208I 2\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n11\n\nNow we can define, for each L-affinoid space X, a topology on the associated\nset X \u266d . It will not be a topology in the classical sense, but a Grothendieck topology, a generalization of the topological concept in the framework of categories. A\nGrothendieck topology specifies a class of opens (admissible opens) and, for each\nadmissible open, a class of covers (admissible covers). These have to satsify certain\naxioms which allow to develop a theory of sheaves and cohomology in this setting.\nA space with a Grothendieck topology is called a site. Any topological space (in the\nclassical sense) can be viewed as a site in a canonical way: the admissible opens and\nadmissible covers are the open subsets and the open covers. For our purposes, we\ndo not need the notion of Grothendieck topology in its most abstract and general\nform: a sufficient treatment is given in [10, 9.1.1].\nThe weak G-topology on an L-affinoid space X is defined as follows: the admissible open sets of X \u266d are the affinoid domains, and the admissible covers are the\naffinoid covers [10, 9.1.4]. Any morphism h of L-affinoid spaces is continuous w.r.t.\nthe weak G-topology (meaning that the inverse image under h\u266d of an admissible\nopen is again an admissible open, and the inverse image of an admissible cover is\nagain an admissible cover). We can define a presheaf of L-algebras OX on X \u266d with\nrespect to this topology, by putting OX (D) = A(D) for any affinoid domain D\nof X (with the natural restriction maps). By Tate's Acyclicity Theorem, OX is a\nsheaf. Note that the exact definition of the weak G-topology varies in literature:\nsometimes the admissible opens are taken to be the finite unions of rational subsets\nin X, and the admissible covers are the covers by admissible opens with a finite\nsubcover (e.g. in [20, \u00a7 4.2]).\nIn the theory of Grothendieck topologies, there is a canonical way to refine the\ntopology without changing the associated category of sheaves [10, 9.1.2]. This\nrefinement is important to get good gluing properties for affinoid spaces, and to obtain continuity of the analytification map (Section 4.6). This leads to the following\ndefinition of the strong G-topology on a L-affinoid space X.\n\u2022 The admissible open sets are (possibly infinite) unions \u222ai\u2208I Di of affinoid\ndomains Di in X, such that, for any morphism of L-affinoid spaces h : Y \u2192\nX, the image of h\u266d in X \u266d is covered by a finite number of Di .\n\u2022 An admissible cover of an admissible open subset V \u2282 X \u266d is a (possibly\ninfinite) set of admissible opens {Vj | j \u2208 J} in X \u266d such that V = \u222aj Vj ,\nand such that, for any morphism of L-affinoid spaces \u03c6 : Y \u2192 X with\nIm (\u03c6\u266d ) \u2282 V , the cover {(\u03c6\u266d )\u22121 (Vj ) | j \u2208 J} of Y can be refined by an\naffinoid cover.\nAny morphism of L-affinoid spaces is continuous w.r.t. the strong G-topology.\nThe strong G-topology on X = Sp A is finer than the Zariski topology on the\nmaximal spectrum of A (this does not hold for the weak G-topology). From now\non, we'll endow all L-affinoid spaces X with the strong G-topology. The strucure\nsheaf OX of X extends uniquely to a sheaf of L-algebras w.r.t. the strong Gtopology, which is called the sheaf of analytic functions on X. One can show that\nits stalks are local rings. In this way, we associate to any L-affinoid space X a\nlocally ringed site in L-algebras (X \u266d , OX ).\nFor any morphism of L-affinoid spaces h : Y \u2192 X, there is a morphism of sheaves\nof L-algebras OX \u2192 (h\u266d )\u2217 OY which defines a morphism of locally ringed spaces\n(Y \u266d , OY ) \u2192 (X \u266d , OX ) (if D = Sp A is an affinoid domain in X, then (h\u266d )\u22121 (D)\nis an affinoid domain Sp B in Y and there is a natural morphism of L-algebras\n\n\f12\n\nJOHANNES NICAISE\n\nA \u2192 B by the universal property defining affinoid domains). This construction\ndefines a functor from the category of L-affinoid spaces to the category of locally\nringed spaces in L-algebras, and this functor is fully faithful [10, 9.3.1.1], i.e. every\nmorphism of locally ringed sites in L-algebras ((Sp B)\u266d , OSp B ) \u2192 ((Sp A)\u266d , OSp A )\nis induced by a morphism of L-algebras A \u2192 B. With slight abuse of notation, we\nwill call the objects in its essential image also L-affinoid spaces, and we'll identify\nan L-affinoid space X with its associated locally ringed site in L-algebras (X \u266d , OX ).\nIf D is an affinoid domain in X, then the strong G-topology on X restricts to\nthe strong G-topology on D, and the restriction of OX to D is the sheaf of analytic\nfunctions OD .\nOne can check that the affinoid space Sp Tm is connected with respect to the\nstrong and the weak G-topology, for any m \u2265 0. More generally, connectedness\nof an L-affinoid space X = Sp A is equivalent for the weak G-topology, the strong\nG-topology, and the Zariski topology [10, 9.1.4, Prop. 8], and it is also equivalent to\nthe property that the ring A has no non-trivial idempotents; so the G-topologies\nnicely reflect the algebraic structure of A.\nExample 5. Let X be the closed unit disc Sp L{x}. The set\nU1 = {z \u2208 X | |x(z)| = 1} = {z \u2208 X | |x(z)| \u2265 1}\n\nis a rational domain in X, so it is an admissible open already for the weak Gtopology. The algebra of analytic functions on U1 is given by\nThe set\n\nOX (U1 ) = L{x, T }/(xT \u2212 1)\n\nU2 = {z \u2208 X | |x(z)| < 1}\nis not an admissible open for the weak G-topology (it cannot be affinoid since the\nfunction |x(.)| does not reach a maximum on U2 ), but it is an admissible open for\nthe strong G-topology: we can write it as an infinite union of rational domains\n(n)\n\nU2\n\n= {z \u2208 X | |x(z)|n \u2264 |a|}\n\nwhere n runs throug N\u2217 and a is any non-zero element of Loo .\nThis family satisfies the finiteness condition in the definition of the strong Gtopology: if Y \u2192 X is any morphism of L-affinoid spaces whose image is contained\nin U2 , then by the maximum principle (Section 4.3) the pull-back of the function\n(n)\n|x(.)| to Y reaches its maximum on Y , so the image of Y is contained in U2 for\nn sufficiently large.\nP\nThe algebra OX (U2 ) of analytic functions on U2 consists of the elements i\u22650 ai xi\nof L[[x]] such that |ai |ri tends to zero as i \u2192 \u221e, for any r \u2208]0, 1[.\nHence, we can write X as a disjoint union U1 \u2294U2 of admissible opens. This does\nnot contradict the fact that X is connected, because {U1 , U2 } is not an admissible\ncover, since it can not be refined by a (finite!) affinoid cover.\n4.5. Rigid varieties. Now, we can give the definition of a general rigid variety over\nL. It is a set X, endowed with a Grothendieck topology and a sheaf of L-algebras\nOX , such that X has an admissible cover {Ui }i\u2208I with the property that each locally\nringed space (Ui , OX |Ui ) is isomorphic to an L-affinoid space. An admissible open\n1To be precise, this Grothendieck topology should satisfy certain additional axioms; see [10,\n9.3.1.4].\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n13\n\nU in X is called an affinoid domain in X if (U, OX |U ) is isomorphic to an L-affinoid\nspace. If X is affinoid, this definition is compatible with the previous one. A\nmorphism Y \u2192 X of rigid varieties over L is a morphism of locally ringed spaces\nin L-algebras.\nA rigid variety over L is called quasi-compact if it is a finite union of affinoid domains. It is called quasi-separated if the intersection of any pair of affinoid domains\nis quasi-compact, and separated if the diagonal morphism is a closed immersion.\n4.6. Analytification of a L-variety. For any L-scheme X of finite type, we can\nendow the set X o of closed points of X with the structure of a rigid L-variety.\nMore precisely, by [8, 0.3.3] and [30, 5.3] there exists a functor\n( . )an : (f t \u2212 Sch/L) \u2192 (Rig/L)\n\nfrom the category of L-schemes of finite type, to the category of rigid L-varieties,\nsuch that\n(1) For any L-scheme of finite type X, there exists a natural morphism of\nlocally ringed sites\ni : X an \u2192 X\nwhich induces a bijection between the underlying set of X an and the set X o\nof closed points of X. The couple (X an , i) satisfies the following universal\nproperty: for any rigid variety Z over L and any morphism of locally ringed\nsites j : Z \u2192 X, there exists a unique morphism of rigid varieties j \u2032 : Z \u2192\nX an such that j = i \u25e6 j \u2032 .\n(2) If f : X \u2032 \u2192 X is a morphism of L-schemes of finite type, the square\nf an\n\n(X \u2032 )an \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 X an\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\niy\nyi\nX\u2032\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 X\ncommutes.\n(3) The functor ( . )an commutes with fibered products, and takes open (resp.\nclosed) immersions of L-schemes to open (resp. closed) immersion of rigid\nL-varieties. In particular, X an is separated if X is separated.\nWe call X an the analytification of X. It is quasi-compact if X is proper over L, but\nnot in general. The analytification functor has the classical GAGA properties: if X\nis proper over L, then analytification induces an equivalence between coherent OX modules and coherent OX an -modules, and the cohomology groups agree; a closed\nrigid subvariety of X an is the analytification of an algebraic subvariety of X; and\nfor any L-variety Y , all morphisms X an \u2192 Y an are algebraic. These results can be\ndeduced from Grothendieck's Existence Theorem; see [31, 2.8].\nExample 6. Let D be the closed unit disc Sp L{x}, and consider the endomorphism\n\u03c3 of D mapping x to a * x, for some non-zero a \u2208 Loo . Then \u03c3 is an isomorphism\nfrom D onto the affinoid domain D(0, |a|) in D (notation as in Example 4). The\nrigid affine line (A1L )an is the limit of the direct system\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c3\n\nD \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 D \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 . . .\nin the category of locally ringed sites in L-algebras. Intuitively, it is obtained as the\nunion of an infinite number of concentric closed discs whose radii tend to \u221e.\n\n\f14\n\nJOHANNES NICAISE\n\n4.7. Rigid spaces and formal schemes. Finally, we come to a second approach\nto the theory of rigid spaces, due to Raynaud [37]. We will only deal with the case\nwhere L = K is a complete discretely valued field, but the theory is valid in greater\ngenerality (see [13]).\nWe've seen before that the underlying topological space of a stf t formal Rscheme X\u221e coincides with the underlying space of its special fiber X0 . Nevertheless,\nthe structure sheaf of X\u221e contains information on an infinitesimal neighbourhood\nof X0 , so one might try to construct the generic fiber X\u03b7 of X\u221e . As it turns out,\nthis is indeed possible, but we have to leave the category of (formal) schemes: this\ngeneric fiber X\u03b7 is a rigid variety over K.\n4.8. The affine case. Let A be an algebra topologically of finite type over R, and\nconsider the affine formal scheme X\u221e = Spf A. The tensor product A \u2297R K is a\nK-affinoid algebra, and the generic fiber X\u03b7 of X\u221e is simply the K-affinoid space\nSp A \u2297R K.\nLet K \u2032 be any finite extension of K, and denote by R\u2032 the normalization of R\nin K \u2032 . There exists a canonical bijection between the set of morphisms of formal\nR-schemes Spf R\u2032 \u2192 X\u221e , and the set of morphisms of rigid K-varieties Sp K \u2032 \u2192\nX\u03b7 . Consider a morphism of formal R-schemes Spf R\u2032 \u2192 X\u221e , or, equivalently,\na morphism of R-algebras A \u2192 R\u2032 . Tensoring with K yields a morphism of Kalgebras A \u2297R K \u2192 R\u2032 \u2297R K \u223c\n= K \u2032 , and hence a K \u2032 -point of X\u03b7 . Conversely, for\nany morphism of K-algebras A \u2297R K \u2192 K \u2032 , the image of A will be contained in\nR\u2032 , since we've already seen in Section 4.2 that the image of R{x1 , . . . , xm } under\nany morphism of K-algebras Tm \u2192 K alg is contained in the normalization Ralg of\nR in K alg .\nTo any R\u2032 -section on X\u221e , we can associate a point of X\u221e , namely the image of\nthe singleton |Spf R\u2032 |. In this way, we obtain a specialization map of sets\nsp : |X\u03b7 | \u2192 |X\u221e | = |X0 |\n\n4.9. The general case. The construction of the generic fiber for general stf t\nformal R-schemes X\u221e is obtained by gluing the constructions on affine charts. The\nimportant point here is that the specialization map sp is continuous: if X\u221e =\nSpf A is affine, then for any open formal subscheme U\u221e of X\u221e , the inverse image\nsp\u22121 (U\u221e ) is an admissible open in X\u03b7 ; in fact, if U\u221e = Spf B is affine, then\nsp\u22121 (U\u221e ) is an affinoid domain in X\u03b7 , canonically isomorphic to U\u03b7 = Sp B \u2297R K.\n(i)\nHence, the generic fibers of the members U\u221e of an affine open cover of a stf t formal\n(i)\n(j)\nR-scheme X\u221e can be glued along the generic fibers of the intersections U\u221e \u2229 U\u221e\nto obtain a rigid K-variety X\u221e , and the specialization maps glue to a continuous\nmap\nsp : |X\u03b7 | \u2192 |X\u221e | = |X0 |\nThis map can be enhanced to a morphism of ringed sites by considering the unique\nmorphism of sheaves\nsp\u266f : OX\u221e \u2192 sp\u2217 OX\u03b7\nwhich is given by the natural map\nOX\u221e (U\u221e ) = A \u2192 A \u2297R K = sp\u2217 OX\u03b7 (U\u221e )\n\non any affine open formal subscheme U\u221e = Spf A of X\u221e .\nThe generic fiber of a stf t formal R-scheme is a separated, quasi-compact rigid\nK-variety. The formal scheme X\u221e is called a formal R-model for the rigid K-variety\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n15\n\nX\u03b7 . Since the generic fiber is obtained by inverting \u03c0, it is clear that the generic\nfiber does not change if we replace X\u221e by its maximal flat closed formal subscheme\n(by killing \u03c0-torsion). If K \u2032 is a finite extension of K and R\u2032 the normalization of\nR in K \u2032 , then we still have a canonical bijection X\u221e (R\u2032 ) = X\u03b7 (K \u2032 ).\nThe construction of the generic fiber is functorial: a morphism of stf t formal\nR-schemes h : Y\u221e \u2192 X\u221e induces a morphism of rigid K-varieties h\u03b7 : Y\u03b7 \u2192 X\u03b7 ,\nand the square\nh\u03b7\n\nY\u03b7 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 X\u03b7\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6sp\nspy\ny\nh\n\ncommutes.

If Z is open in X0 ,\nthen ]Z[ is canonically isomorphic to the generic fiber of the open formal subscheme\nZ\u221e = (|Z|, OX\u221e |Z ) of X\u221e . The tube ]Z[ is quasi-compact if Z is open, but not in\ngeneral.\nBerthelot showed in [8, 0.2.6] how to construct the generic fiber of a broader\nclass of formal R-schemes, not necessarily tf t. If Z is closed in X0 , then ]Z[ is\ncanonically isomorphic to the generic fiber of the formal completion of X\u221e along\nZ (this formal completion is the locally topologically ringed space with underlying\ntopological space |Z| and strucure sheaf\nlim\nOX\u221e /IZn\n\u2190\u2212\nn\n\nwhere IZ is the defining ideal sheaf of Z in X\u221e ). In particular, if Z is a closed point\nx of X0 , then ]x[ is the generic fiber of the formal spectrum of the completed local\nbX\u221e ,x with its adic topology (we did not define this notion; see [23, 10.1]).\nring O\n\nExample 7. Let X\u221e be an affine stf t formal R-scheme, say X\u221e = Spf A. Consider\ntuple of elements f1 , . . . , fr in A, and denote by Z the closed subscheme of X0\ndefined by the residue classes f 1 , . . . , f r in A0 . The tube ]Z[ of Z in X\u221e consists of\nthe points x of X\u03b7 with |fi (x)| < 1 for i = 1, . . . , r (since this condition is equivalent\nto fi (x) \u2261 0 mod (K alg )oo ).\nIf X\u221e = Spf R{x}, then X\u03b7 is the closed unit disc Sp K{x}, and the special\nfiber X0 is the affine line A1k .

The first one is quasi-compact, the second is not.\n2The notion of boundary is only well-defined if you specify a center of the disc, since any point\nof a closed disc can serve as a center, due to the ultrametric property of the absolute value.\n\n\f16\n\nJOHANNES NICAISE\n\n4.10. Localization by formal blow-ups. The functor ( . )\u03b7 is not an equivalence.\nOne can show that formal blow-ups are turned into isomorphisms [13, 4.1]. Intuitively, this is clear: the center I of a formal blow-up contains a power of \u03c0, so it\nbecomes the unit ideal after inverting \u03c0.\nIn some sense, this is the only obstruction. Denote by C the category of flat stf t\nformal R-schemes, localized with respect to the formal blow-ups. This means that\nwe artificially add inverse morphisms for formal blow-ups, thus turning them into\nisomorphisms. The objects of C are simply the flat stf t formal R-schemes, but a\n\u2032\n\u2032\nmorphism in C from Y\u221e to X\u221e is given by a triple (Y\u221e\n, \u03c61 , \u03c62 ) where \u03c61 : Y\u221e\n\u2192 Y\u221e\n\u2032\nis a formal blow-up, and \u03c62 : Y\u221e \u2192 X\u221e a morphism of stf t formal R-schemes.\n\u2032\u2032\nWe identify this triple with another triple (Y\u221e\n, \u03c81 , \u03c82 ) if there exist a third triple\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n(Z\u221e , \u03c71 , \u03c72 ) and morphisms of stf t formal R-schemes Z\u221e \u2192 Y\u221e\nand Z\u221e \u2192 Y\u221e\nsuch that the obvious triangles commute.\nSince admissible blow-ups are turned into isomorphisms by the functor ( . )\u03b7 , it\nfactors though a functor C \u2192 (sqc \u2212 Rig/K). Raynaud [37] showed that this is an\nequivalence of categories (a detailed proof is given in [13]). This means that the\ncategory of separated, quasi-compact rigid K-varieties, can be described entirely in\nterms of formal schemes. To give an idea of this dictionary between formal schemes\nand rigid varieties, we list some results. Let X be a separated, quasi-compact rigid\nvariety over K.\n\u2022 [13, 4.1(e),4.7] There exists a flat stf t formal R-scheme X\u221e such that X\nis isomorphic to X\u03b7 .\n\u2022 [13, 4.1(c+d)] If X\u221e and Y\u221e are stf t formal R-schemes and \u03c6 : Y\u03b7 \u2192 X\u03b7\nis a morphism of rigid K-varieties, then in general, \u03c6 will not extend to\na morphism Y\u221e \u2192 X\u221e on the R-models. However, by Raynaud's result,\n\u2032\nthere exist a formal blow-up f : Y\u221e\n\u2192 Y\u221e and a morphism of stf t formal\n\u2032\nR-schemes g : Y\u221e \u2192 X\u221e , such that \u03c6 = g\u03b7 \u25e6(f\u03b7 )\u22121 . If \u03c6 is an isomorphism,\n\u2032\nwe can find (Y\u221e\n, f, g) with both f and g formal blow-ups.\n\u2022 [13, 4.4] For any affinoid cover U of X, there exist a formal model X\u221e of\nX and a Zariski cover {U1 , . . . , Us } of X0 such that U = { ]U1 [, . . . , ]Us [ }.\n\nSee [13, 14, 15, 16] for many other results.\n\nExample 8.

The problem is that the section\nx/\u03c0 is not defined on Y\u221e ; however, blowing up the ideal (x, \u03c0) adds this section to\nthe ring of regular functions, and the formal blow-up scheme is isomorphic to X\u221e .\nNext, consider the stf t formal R-scheme Z\u221e = Spf R{x}, and the standard cover\nof Z\u03b7 defined by the couple (x, \u03c0). The cover consists of the closed disc D(0, |\u03c0|)\nand the closed annulus Z\u03b7 \\ D\u2212 (0, |\u03c0|) (notation as in Example 4). These sets are\nnot tubes in Z\u221e , since by Example 7, both sets have non-empty intersection with the\n\u2032\ntube ]O[ but do not coincide with it. But if we take the formal blow-up Z\u221e\n\u2192 Z\u221e\nat the ideal (x, \u03c0), then the rational subsets in our standard cover are precisely the\ngeneric fibers of the blow-up charts Spf R{x, T }/(xT \u2212\u03c0) and Spf R{x, T }/(x\u2212\u03c0T ).\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n17\n\n4.11.

The point x defines a morphism x : Spec K \u2032 \u2192 X. The\nvaluative criterion for properness guarantees that the morphism Spec R\u2032 \u2192 Spec R\nlifts to a unique morphism h : Spec R\u2032 \u2192 X with hK = x.

A very nice\nsurvey of the theory and some of its applications is given in [19].\nFor a commutative Banach ring with unity (A , k * * * k), the spectrum M (A ) is\nthe set of all bounded multiplicative semi-norms x : A \u2192 R+ (where \"bounded\"\nmeans that there exists a number C > 0 such that x(a) \u2264 Ckak for all a in A ).\nIf x is a point of M (A ), then x\u22121 (0) is a prime ideal of A , and x descends to an\nabsolute value |.| on the quotient field of A /x\u22121 (0). The completion of this field is\ncalled the residue field of x, and denoted by H (x). Hence, any point x of M (A )\ngives rise to a bounded ring morphism \u03c7x from A to the complete valued field\nH (x), and x is completely determined by \u03c7x . In this way, one can characterize\nthe points of M (A ) as equivalence classes of bounded ring morphisms from A to\na complete valued field [2, 1.2.2(ii)], just as one can view elements of the spectrum\nSpec B of a commutative ring B either as prime ideals in B or as equivalence classes\nof ring morphisms from B to a field.\nIf we denote the image of f \u2208 A under \u03c7x by f (x), then x(f ) = |f (x)|. We\nendow M (A ) with the weakest topology such that M (A ) \u2192 R : x 7\u2192 |f (x)|\nis continuous for each f in A . This topology is called the spectral topology on\nM (A ). If A is not the zero ring, it makes M (A ) into a non-empty compact\nHausdorff topological space [2, 1.2.1]. A bounded morphism of Banach algebras\nA \u2192 B induces a continuous map M (B) \u2192 M (A ) between their spectra. In\nparticular, the spectrum of A only depends on the equivalence class of k.k.\nIf L is a non-archimedean field with non-trivial absolute value and A is an Laffinoid algebra (these are called strictly L-affinoid in Berkovich' theory) then A\ncarries a Banach norm, well-defined up to equivalence (Section 4.2). The spectrum\nM (A) of A is called a strictly L-affinoid analytic space; Berkovich endows these\ntopological spaces with a structure sheaf of analytic functions. General strictly\nL-analytic spaces are obtained by gluing strictly L-affinoid spaces.\nAny maximal ideal x of A defines a point of M (A): the bounded multiplicative\nsemi-norm sending f \u2208 A to |f (x)|. This defines a natural injection Sp A \u2192 M (A),\nwhose image consists of the points y of M (A) with [H (y) : L] < \u221e. So M (A)\ncontains the \"classical\" rigid points of Sp A, but in general also additional points z\nwith z \u22121 (0) not a maximal ideal. Beware that the natural map\nM (A) \u2192 Spec A : z 7\u2192 z \u22121 (0)\nis not injective, in general: if P \u2208 Spec A is not a maximal ideal, there may be\nseveral bounded absolute values on A/P extending the absolute value on L.\nFor a Hausdorff strictly L-analytic space X, the set of rigid points\nXrig := {x \u2208 X | [H (x) : L] < \u221e}\ncan be endowed with the structure of a quasi-separated rigid variety over L in a\nnatural way. Moreover, the functor X 7\u2192 Xrig induces an equivalence between\nthe category of paracompact strictly L-analytic spaces, and the category of quasiseparated rigid varieties over L which have an admissible affinoid covering of finite\ntype [3, 1.6.1]. The space Xrig is quasi-compact if and only if X is compact.\nThe big advantage of Berkovich spaces is that they carry a \"true\" topology\ninstead of a Grothendieck topology, with very nice features (Hausdorff, locally\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n19\n\nconnected by arcs,. . . ). As we've seen, Berkovich obtains his spaces by adding points\nto the points of a rigid variety (not unlike the generic points in algebraic geometry)\nwhich have an interpretation in terms of valuations. We refer to [2, 1.4.4] for a\ndescription of the points and the topology of the closed unit disc D = M ( L{x}).\nTo give a taste of these Berkovich spaces, let us explain how two points of Drig\ncan be joined by a path in D. We assume, for simplicity, that L is algebraically\nclosed. For each point a of Drig and each \u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1] we define D(a, \u03c1) as the set of\npoints z in Drig with |x(z) \u2212 x(a)| \u2264 \u03c1. This is not an affinoid domain if \u03c1 \u2208\n/ |L\u2217 |.\nAny such disc E = D(a, \u03c1) defines a bounded\nP\u221e multiplicative semi-norm |.|E on the\nBanach algebra L{x}, by mapping f = n=0 an (T \u2212 a)n to\n|f |E = sup |f (z)| = max |an |\u03c1n\nn\n\nz\u2208E\n\nand hence, E defines a Berkovich-point of D. Now a path between two points a, b\nof Drig = Lo can be constructed as follows: put \u03b4 = |x(a) \u2212 x(b)| and consider the\npath\n\u001a\nD(a, 2t\u03b4), if 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1/2,\n\u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 D : t 7\u2192\nD(b, 2(1 \u2212 t)\u03b4), if 1/2 \u2264 t \u2264 1.\nGeometrically, this path can be seen as a closed disc around a, growing continuously\nin time t until it contains b, and then shrinking to b.\nA remarkable feature of Berkovich' theory is that it can also be applied to the\ncase where L carries the trivial absolute value. If k is any field, and X is an algebraic\nvariety over k, then we can endow k with the trivial absolute value and consider\nthe Berkovich analytic space X an associated to X over k [2, 3.5]. Surprisingly, the\ntopology of X an contains non-trivial information on X. For instance, if k = C, then\nthe rational singular cohomology Hsing (X an , Q) of X an is canonically isomorphic\nto the weight zero part of the rational singular cohomology of the complex analytic\nspace X(C) [7, 1.1(c)]. We refer to [36] and [41] for other applications of analytic\nspaces w.r.t. trivial absolute values.\nLet us mention that there are still alternative approaches to non-archimedean\ngeometry, such as Fujiwara and Kato's Zariski-Riemann spaces [21], or Huber's adic\nspaces [27]. See [43] for a (partial) comparison.\n6. Some applications\n6.1. Relation to arc schemes and the Milnor fibration.\n6.1.1. Arc spaces. Let k be any field, and let X be a separated scheme of finite\ntype over k. Put R = k[[t]]. For each n \u2265 1, we define a functor\nFn : (k \u2212 alg) \u2192 (Sets) : A \u2192 X(A \u2297k Rn )\n\nfrom the category of k-algebras to the category of sets. It is representable by a\nseparated k-scheme of finite type Ln (X) (this is nothing but the Weil restriction of\nX \u00d7k Rn to k). For any pair of integers m \u2265 n \u2265 0, the truncation map Rm \u2192 Rn\ninduces by Yoneda's Lemma a morphism of k-schemes\n\u03c0nm : Lm (X) \u2192 Ln (X)\n\nIt is easily seen that these morphisms are affine, and hence, we can consider the\nprojective limit\nL(X) := lim\nLn (X)\n\u2190\u2212\nn\n\n\f20\n\nJOHANNES NICAISE\n\nin the category of k-schemes. This scheme is called the arc scheme of X. It satisfies\nL(X)(k \u2032 ) = X(k \u2032 [[t]]) for any field k \u2032 over k (these points are called arcs on X),\nand comes with natural projections\n\u03c0n : L(X) \u2192 Ln (X)\n\nIn particular, we have a morphism \u03c00 : L(X) \u2192 L0 (X) = X. For any subscheme Z\nof X, we put L(X)Z = L(X) \u00d7X Z. By Yoneda's lemma, a morphism of separated\nk-schemes of finite type h : Y \u2192 X induces k-morphisms h : Ln (Y ) \u2192 Ln (X), and\nby passage to the limit, a k-morphism h : L(Y ) \u2192 L(X).\nIf X is smooth over k, the schemes Ln (X) and L(X) are fairly well understood:\nif X has pure dimension d, then, for each pair of integers m \u2265 n \u2265 0, \u03c0nm is a locally\nd(m\u2212n)\ntrivial fibration with fiber Ak\n(w.r.t. the Zariski topology). If x is a singular\npoint of X, however, the scheme L(X)x is still quite mysterious. It contains a lot\nof information on the singular germ (X, x); interesting invariants can be extracted\nby the theory of motivic integration (see [17, 18, 44]).\nThe schemes L(X)x and L(X) are not Noetherian, in general, which complicates\nthe study of their geometric poperties. Already the fact that they have only finitely\nmany irreducible components if k has characteristic zero, is a non-trivial result. We\nwill show how rigid geometry allows to translate questions concerning the arc space\ninto arithmetic problems on rigid varieties.\n6.1.2. The relative case. Let k be any algebraically closed field of characteristic\nzero3, and put R = k[[t]]. For each integer d > 0, K = k((t)) has a unique\nextension K(d) of degree d in a fixed algebraic closure K alg of K, obtained by\njoining a d-th root of t to K. We denote by R(d) the normalization \u221a\nof R in K(d).\nd\nalg\nt, such that\nFor\neach\nd\n>\n0,\nwe\nchoose\nof\na\nd-th\nroot\nof\nt\nin\nK\n,\ndenoted\nby\n\u221a e\n\u221a\nde\nd\n( t) = \u221at for each d, e > 0. This choice defines an isomorphism of k-algebras\nR(d) \u223c\n= k[[ d t]]. It also induces an isomorphism of R-algebras\nX\nX\n\u221a\nd\n\u03c6d : R(d) \u2192 R(d)\u2032 :\nai ( t)i 7\u2192\na i ti\ni\u22650\n\ni\u22650\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere R(d) is the ring R with R-algebra structure given by\nX\nX\nR\u2192R:\nbi ti 7\u2192\nbi tid\ni\u22650\n\ni\u22650\n\nLet X be a smooth irreducible variety over k, endowed with a dominant morb the formal completion of the\nphism f : X \u2192 A1k = Spec k[t]. We denote by X\nR-scheme XR = X \u00d7k[t] k[[t]]; we will also call this the t-adic completion of f . Its\nspecial fiber X0 is simply the fiber of f over the origin.\nb\u03b7 of X,\nb\nThere exists a tight connection between the points on the generic fiber X\nand the arcs on X. For any integer d > 0, we denote by X (d) the closed subscheme\nof L(X) defined by\nX (d) = {\u03c8 \u2208 L(X) | f (\u03c8) = td }\nWe will construct a canonical bijection\nsuch that the square\n\nb\u03b7 (K(d)) \u2192 X (d)(k)\n\u03c6:X\n\n3This condition is only imposed to simplify the arguments.\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n21\n\n\u03c6\nb\u03b7 (K(d)) \u2212\u2212\u2212\nX\n\u2212\u2192 X (d)(k)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u03c0\nspy\ny 0\n\nX0 (k)\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 X0 (k)\n\ncommutes.\nAs we've seen in Section 4.9, the specialization morphism of ringed sites sp :\nb\u03b7 \u2192 X\nb induces a bijection X\nb\u03b7 (K(d)) \u2192 X(R(d)),\nb\nX\nand the morphism sp maps\n\u221a\nb\u03b7 (K(d)) to the reduction modulo d t of the corresponding point of\na point of X\nb\nX(R(d)).\nBy Grothendieck's Existence Theorem (Section 3.4), the completion\nb\nfunctor induces a bijection (XR )(R(d)) \u2192 X(R(d)).\nFinally, the R-isomorphism\n\u2032\n\u03c6d : R(d) \u2192 R(d) induces a bijection\n(XR )(R(d)) \u2192 (XR )(R(d)\u2032 ) = X (d)(k)\n\nIn other words, if we take an arc \u03c8 : Spec R \u2192 X with f (\u03c8) = td , then the\nmorphism \u03c8b\u03b7 yields a K(d)-point on X\u03b7 , and this correspondence defines a bijection\nb\u03b7 (K(d)). Moreover, the image of \u03c8 under the projection\nbetween X (d)(k) and X\nb\u03b7 (K(d))\n\u03c00 : L(X) \u2192 X is nothing but the image of the corresponding element of X\nb\nb\nunder the specialization map sp : |X\u03b7 | \u2192 |X| = |X0 |.\nb\u03b7 (K(d)), and its action on the\nThe Galois group G(K(d)/K) = \u03bcd (k) acts on X\nlevel of arcs is easy to describe: if \u03c8 is an arc Spec R \u2192 X with f (\u03c8) = td , and \u03be\nis an element of \u03bcd (k), then \u03be.\u03c8(t) = \u03c8(\u03be.t).\nThe spaces X (d), with their \u03bcd (k)-action, are quite close to the arc spaces appearing in the definition of the motivic zeta function associated to f [18, 3.2]. In\nfact, the motivic zeta function can be realized in terms of the motivic integral of\nb\u03b7 , and the relationship between arc schemes and rigid\na Gelfand-Leray form on X\nvarieties can be used in the study of motivic zeta functions and the monodromy\nconjecture, as is explained in [35, 34].\n6.1.3. The absolute case. This case is easily reduced to the previous one. Let X be\nany separated k-scheme of finite type, and consider its base change XR = X \u00d7k R.\nb the formal completion of XR .\nWe denote by X\nThere exists a canonical bijection between the sets L(X)(k) and XR (R). Hence,\nby the results in the previous section, k-rational arcs on X correspond to K-points\nb\u03b7 of X,\nb by a canonical bijection\non the generic fiber X\nand the square\n\nb\u03b7 (K)\n\u03c6 : L(X)(k) \u2192 X\n\n\u03c6\nb\u03b7 (K)\nL(X)(k) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 X\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6sp\n\uf8e6\n\u03c00 y\ny\n\nX(k)\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 X(k)\n\ncommutes. So the rigid counterpart of the space L(X)Z := L(X) \u00d7X Z of arcs with\nb\u03b7 (or rather, its\norigin in some closed subscheme Z of X, is the tube ]Z[ of Z in X\nset of K-rational points).\n\n\f22\n\nJOHANNES NICAISE\n\nOf course, the scheme structure on L(X) is very different from the analytic strucb\u03b7 . Nevertheless, the structure on X\nb\u03b7 seems to be much richer than the one\nture on X\non L(X), and one might hope that some essential properties of the non-Noetherian\nb\u03b7 . Moreover, there exscheme L(X) are captured by the more \"geometric\" object X\nists a satisfactory theory of \u00e9tale cohomology for rigid K-varieties (see for instance\n[3] or [27]), making it possible to apply cohomological techniques to the study of\nthe arc space.\n6.1.4. The analytic Milnor fiber. Let g : Cm \u2192 C be an analytic map, and denote\nby Y0 the analytic space defined by g = 0. Let x be a point of Y0 . Consider an open\ndisc D := B(0, \u03b7) of radius \u03b7 around the origin in C, and an open disc B := B(x, \u03b5)\nin Cm . We denote by D\u00d7 the punctured disc D \u2212 {0}, and we put\nX \u2032 := B \u2229 g \u22121 (D\u00d7 )\n\nThen, for 0 < \u03b7 \u226a \u03b5 \u226a 1, the induced map\n\ng \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 D\u00d7\n\nis a C \u221e locally trivial fibration, called the Milnor fibration of g at x. It is trivial if\ng is smooth at x. Its fiber at a point t of D\u00d7 is denoted by Fx (t), and it is called\nthe (topological) Milnor fiber of g at x (w.r.t. t). To remove the dependency on the\nbase point, one constructs the canonical Milnor fiber Fx by considering the fiber\nproduct\ng\n\u00d7\nFx := X \u2032 \u00d7D\u00d7 D\ng\n\u00d7 is the universal covering space\nwhere D\n\ng\n\u00d7 = {z \u2208 C | I(z) > \u2212 log \u03b7} \u2192 D \u00d7 : z 7\u2192 exp(iz)\nD\n\nSince this covering space is contractible, Fx is homotopically equivalent to Fx (t).\nThe group of covering transformations \u03c01 (D\u00d7 ) acts on the singular cohomology\nof Fx ; the action of the canonical generator z 7\u2192 z + 2\u03c0 of \u03c01 (D\u00d7 ) is called the\nmonodromy transformation of g at x. The Milnor fibration g \u2032 was devised in [32]\nas a tool to gather information on the topology of Y0 near x.\nWe return to the algebraic setting: let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, put R = k[[t]], let X be a smooth irreducible variety over k, and\nb\nlet f : X \u2192 A1k = Spec k[t] be a dominant morphism. As before, we denote by X\nb\u03b7 . For any closed point x\nthe formal t-adic completion of f , with generic fiber X\non X0 , we put Fx :=]x[, and we call this rigid K-variety the analytic Milnor fiber\nof f at x. This object was introduced and studied in [33, 34]. We consider it as a\nbridge between the topological Milnor fibration and arc spaces; a tight connection\nbetween these data is predicted by the motivic monodromy conjecture. See [35] for\nmore on this point of view.\nThe topological intuition behind the construction is the following: the formal\nneighbourhood Spf R of the origin in A1k = Spec k[t], corresponds to an infinitesimally small disc around the origin in C. Its inverse image under f is realized as\nb should be seen as a\nthe t-adic completion of the morphism f ; the formal scheme X\ntubular neighborhood of the special fiber X0 defined by f on X. The inverse image\nb i.e. the generic fiber\nof the punctured disc becomes the \"complement\" of X0 in X,\nb\nb\nX\u03b7 of X. The specialization map sp can be seen as a canonical \"contraction\" of\nb\u03b7 on X0 , such that Fx corresponds to the topological space X \u2032 considered above.\nX\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n23\n\nNote that this is not really the Milnor fiber yet: we had to base-change to a univer[\nalg instead of F , by the\nbKK\nsal cover of D\u00d7 , which corresponds to considering Fx \u00d7\nx\n\u00d7\ndictionary between finite covers of D and finite extensions of K.

Moreover, by Berkovich' comparison result in\n[5, 3.5] (see also Section 6.3), there are canonical isomorphisms\ni\ni\n[\nalg , Q ) \u223c\nbKK\nH\u00e9t\n(Fx \u00d7\nl = R \u03c8\u03b7 (Ql )x\n\nsuch that the Galois action of G(K alg /K) on the left hand side corresponds to the\n\u2217\nis \u00e9tale l-adic cohomology,\nmonodromy action of G(K alg /K) on the right. Here H\u00e9t\nand R\u03c8\u03b7 denotes the l-adic nearby cycle functor associated to f . In particular, if\ni\n[\nalg , Q ) is canonically isomorphic to the sinbKK\nk = C, this implies that H\u00e9t\n(Fx \u00d7\nl\ni\ngular cohomology Hsing (Fx , Ql ) of the canonical Milnor fiber Fx of f at x, and that\nb\nthe action of the canonical topological generator of G(K alg /K) = Z(1)(C)\ncorresponds to the monodromy trasformation, by Deligne's classical comparison theorem\nfor \u00e9tale and analytic nearby cycles [1, XIV]. In view of the motivic monodromy\nconjecture, it is quite intriguing that Fx relates certain arc spaces to monodromy\naction; see [35] for more background on this perspective.\n6.2. Deformation theory and lifting problems. Suppose that R has mixed\ncharacteristic, and let X0 be a scheme of finite type over the residue field k. Illusie\nsketches in [28, 5.1] the following problem: is there a flat scheme X of finite type over\nR such that X0 = X \u00d7R k? Grothendieck suggested the following approach: first,\ntry to construct an inductive system Xn of flat Rn -schemes of finite type such that\nXn \u223c\n= Xm \u00d7Rm Rn for m \u2265 n \u2265 0. In many situations, the obstructions to lifting\nXn to Xn+1 live in a certain cohomology group of X0 , and when these obstructions\nvanish, the isomorphism classes of possible Xn+1 correspond to elements in another\napproriate cohomology group of X0 . Once we found such an inductive system, its\ndirect limit is a flat formal R-scheme X\u221e , topologically of finite type. Next, we\nneed to know if this formal scheme is algebrizable, i.e. if there exists an R-scheme\nb is isomorphic to X\u221e . This scheme X would be a\nX whose formal completion X\nsolution to our lifting problem. A useful criterion to prove the existence of X is the\none quoted in Section 3.4: if X0 is proper and carries an ample line bundle that lifts\nto a line bundle on X\u221e , then X\u221e is algebrizable. Moreover, the algebraic model\nX is unique op to isomorphism by Grothendieck's existence theorem (Section 3.4).\nFor more concrete applications of this approach, we refer to Section 5 of [28].\n6.3. Nearby cycles for formal schemes. Berkovich used his \u00e9tale cohomology\ntheory for non-archimedean analytic spaces, developed in [3], to construct nearby\nand vanishing cycles functors for formal schemes [4, 5]. His formalism applies, in\nparticular, to stf t formal R-schemes X\u221e , and to formal completions of such formal\nschemes along closed subschemes of the special fiber X0 . Let us denote by R\u03c8\u03b7 the\nfunctor of nearby cycles, both in the algebraic and in the formal setting. Suppose\nb its\nthat k is algebraically closed. Let X be a variety over R, and denote by X\nb\nformal completion, with generic fiber X\u03b7 .

Similar results hold for\nbKK\nto the i-th l-adic cohomology space of the tube ]x[\u00d7\ntame nearby cycles and vanishing cycles.\nThis proves a conjecture of Deligne's, stating that R\u03c8\u03b7 (F )|Y only depends on\nthe formal completion of X along Y . In particular, the stalk of R\u03c8\u03b7 (F ) at a closed\nbX,x .\npoint x of X0 only depends on the completed local ring O\n6.4. Semi-stable reduction for curves. Bosch and L\u00fctkebohmert show in [12,\n11] how rigid geometry can be used to construct stable models for smooth projective\ncurves over a non-archimedean field L, and uniformizations for Abelian varieties.\nLet us briefly sketch their approach to stable reduction of curves.\nIf A is a reduced Tate algebra over L, then we define\nAo\nAoo\n\n=\n=\n\n{f \u2208 A | kf ksup \u2264 1}\n{f \u2208 A | kf ksup < 1}\n\nNote that Ao is a subring of A, and that Aoo is an ideal in Ao . The quotient\ne := Ao /Aoo is a reduced algebra of finite type over L\u0303, by [10, 1.2.5.7+6.3.4.3],\nA\ne := Spec A\ne is called the canonical reduction of the affinoid space X := Sp A.\nand X\ne mapping points of X to closed points of\nThere is a natural reduction map X \u2192 X\ne\ne is called the formal fiber of X at x;\nX. The inverse image of a closed point x of X\nit is an open rigid subspace of X.\nLet C be a projective, smooth, geometrically connected curve over L, and consider its analytification C an . By a technical descent argument we may assume that\nL is algebraically closed. The idea is to construct a finite admissible cover U of C an\ne are semi-stable. If the cover U\nby affinoid domains U whose canonical reductions U\ne can be glued\nsatisfies a certain compatibility property, the canonical reductions U\ne\nto a semi-stable L-variety.\nFrom this cover U one constructs a semi-stable model\nfor C. The advantage of passing to the rigid world is that the Grothendieck topology on C an is much finer then the Zariski topology on C, allowing finer patching\ntechniques.\nTo construct the cover U, it is proved that smooth points and ordinary double\ne can be recognized by looking at their formal fiber in U . For instance,\npoints on U\ne is smooth iff its formal fiber is isomorphic to an open disc of\na closed point x of U\nradius 1. An alternative proof based on rigid geometry is given in [20, 5.6].\n6.5. Constructing \u00e9tale covers, and Abhyankar's Conjecture. Formal and\nrigid patching techniques can also be used in the construction of Galois covers;\nsee [26] for an introduction to this subject. This approach generalizes the classical\nRiemann Existence Theorem for complex curves to a broader class of base fields.\nRiemann's Existence Theorem states that, for any smooth connected complex curve\n\n\fFORMAL AND RIGID GEOMETRY, AND SOME APPLICATIONS\n\n25\n\nX, there is an equivalence between the category of finite \u00e9tale covers of X, the\ncategory of finite analytic covering spaces of the complex analytic space X an , and\nthe category of finite topological covering spaces of X(C) (w.r.t. the complex\ntopology). So the problem of constructing an \u00e9tale cover is reduced to the problem\nof constructing a topological covering space, where we can proceed locally w.r.t. the\ncomplex topology and glue the resulting local covers. In particular, it can be shown\nin this way that any finite group is the Galois group of a finite Galois extension of\nC(x), by studying the ramified Galois covers of the complex projective line.\nThe strategy in rigid geometry is quite similar: given a smooth curve X over\na non-archimedean field L, we consider its analytification X an . We construct an\n\u00e9tale cover Y \u2032 of X an by constructing covers locally, and gluing them to a rigid\nvariety. Then we use a GAGA-theorem to show that Y \u2032 is algebraic, i.e. Y \u2032 = Y an\nfor some curve Y over L; Y is an \u00e9tale cover of X. Of course, several technical\ncomplications have to be overcome to carry out this strategy.\nWe list some results that can be obtained by means of these techniques, and\nreferences to their proofs.\n\u2022 (Harbater) For any finite group G, there exists a ramified Galois cover\nf : X \u2192 P1L with Galois group G, such that X is absolutely irreducible,\nsmooth, and projective, and such that there exists a point x in X(L) at\nwhich f is unramified. An accessible proof by Q. Liu is given in [29]; see\nalso [42, \u00a7 3].\n\u2022 (Abhyankar's Conjecture for the projective line) Let k be an algebraically\nclosed field of characteristic p > 0. A finite group G is the Galois group of\na covering of P1k , only ramified over \u221e, iff G is generated by its elements\nhaving order pn with n \u2265 1. This conjecture was proven by Raynaud in\n[38]. This article also contains an introduction to rigid geometry and \u00e9tale\ncovers.\n\u2022 (Abhyankar's Conjecture) Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0. Let X be a smooth connected projective curve over k\nof genus g, let \u03be0 , . . . , \u03ber (r \u2265 0) be distinct closed points on X, and let\n\u0393g,r be the topological fundamental group of a complex Riemann surface of\ngenus g minus r + 1 points (it is the free group on 2g + r generators). Put\nU = X \\ {\u03be0 , . . . , \u03ber }. A finite group G is the Galois group of an unramified\nGalois cover of U , iff every prime-to-p quotient of G is a quotient of \u0393g,r .\nThis conjecture was proven by Harbater in [25].\n\nReferences\n[1] Groupes de monodromie en g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique.
