INTRODUCTION\nBecause of an ultimately short duration of videopulse the electric field polarization cannot change\npolarity in the time of pulse action1-3. Such pulses represent bursts of energy of the field, for which\nthe concepts of carrier frequency and wavelength are no longer applicable4-6. The conventional for\nnonlinear optics of quasimonochromatic pulses slow envelope approximation and rotating wave approximations7,8 should be rejected or at least specified to account the next orders of perturbation\ntheory. The propagation of ultimately short pulses including videopulse in a two-level medium was\ninvestigated in a typical for many resonance media situation, when the diagonal elements of the dipole operator are zero9,10. However, there are media (molecular gases, adsorbed atoms, quantum\ndots arrays) where the linear Stark effect takes place11-13. In these cases, the diagonal elements of\ndipole transition operator between resonance levels are non-zero.\nAnalogous to Kerr media, the media with non-zero diagonal elements of dipole moment can be\ncalled Stark media14-15. The interaction of a few cycle electromagnetic pulse with Stark medium\nwith no account of propagation effects was considered in16. At the same time, the lift of slow amplitude approximation supplemented with unidirectional wave approximation makes the problem\ncompletely integrable and permits to find steady-state solutions in soliton form17-19. Further analysis\nrevealed a new solitary electromagnetic object, the non-zero breather20,21.\nIn this paper a thin layer of permanent dipole atoms with a thickness of the order of a wavelength\nplaced on an interface of two dielectric media represents a simple example of 2D system, which optical properties has been intensively studied22-26. Thin film physics is attributed by an account of\nmicroscopic field acting on resonance atoms due to dipole-dipole interaction27-29. The most of studies of the short pulse refraction by such nonlinear interface were carried out under the assumption\n1\n\nE-mail: elyutin@mail.ru, soelyutin@email.mephi.ru\n\n\fthat the atoms of a film were modeled by a two-level system in one-photon resonance with the incident radiation30,31. The approaches worked out for conventional models were extended to another\nlow dimension systems, such as the layer of quantum dots32, film of three level atoms33,34, and different type of resonance, for instance, the two-photon resonance35,36\nThe aim of this work is to demonstrate by numerical modeling, how an ultimate shortness\n(about a field halfperiod) of electromagnetic \"buble\"1 (videopulse) and Stark effect due to the permanent atom dipole moments become apparent in interaction of pulsed field with a specific low dimensional medium \u2013 thin layer, where local field contribution is evidently perceptible. It turned out\nthat in such model in the absence of relaxation the trigger switching of film state can be realised under the action of inner local field. It is shown that a thin layer of dipolar atoms being irradiated with\na videopulse is able to emit a short signal with a very long delay, longer than all characteristic times\nof the problem.\n2. THE COUPLING EQUATION\nLet a thin polarizable film of thickness l lie on the interface of two dielectric media. The thickness\nof the atom layer is supposed to be less than a spatial extent of electromagnetic pulse. Let Z-axis be\nnormal to the interface. For a wave polarized in the plane of interface the continuity conditions look\nlike:\n\nE y ( z = 0 \u2212 , t ) = E y ( z = 0+ , t ) ,\nH x ( z = 0\u2212 , t ) \u2212 H x ( z = 0+ , t ) =\n\n4\u03c0 \u2202\nPS , y (t ) ,\nc \u2202t\n\n(1.1)\n(1.2)\n\nwhere PS , y = Py ( z = 0, t ) \u2013 is a surface polarization of the film.\nLet the short pulse of the \u0422\u0415-wave be incident on the interface from a Z<0 side. For simplicity, the\ndielectric media posses no dispersion and the electromagnetic pulse has an arbitrary duration, thus\nnot being necessarily a quasiharmonic wave. Then the solution of Maxwell equations writes in the\nfollowing form:\n\n\u23a7 E (t \u2212 z / V\u2212 ) + Eref (t + z / V+ ) , z < 0\nE y ( z , t ) = \u23a8 in\nz>0\n\u23a9 Etr (t \u2212 z / V+ ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nHere V\u00b1 is the solitary wave (pulse) group velocity in a matter with the corresponded signs of z\ncoordinate. Due to the absence of dispersion, the group velocities are the determined permanent\nvalues characterizing the media. The continuity condition (1.1) provides the relationship\nEin (t ) + Eref (t ) = Etr (t ) .\n\nIt results from Maxwell equations that for the planar symmetry\n\u2202E y\n\u2202z\n\n=\n\n1 \u2202H x\n.\nc \u2202t\n\n(3)\n\n\fBy using this expression, one can get from (1.2) that\n1 \u2202\n1 \u2202\n4\u03c0 \u2202 2\nH x ( z = 0+ , t ) \u2212\nH x ( z = 0\u2212 , t ) = 2 2 PS , y (t ) ,\n\u0441 \u2202t\n\u0441 \u2202t\nc \u2202t\nor\n\u2202\n\u2202\n4\u03c0 \u2202 2\nE y ( z = 0+ , t ) \u2212\nE y ( z = 0\u2212 , t ) = 2 2 PS , y (t ) .\n\u2202z\n\u2202z\nc \u2202t\n\n(4)\n\nMaking use of expression (2) and bearing in mind that introduction of retarded time t \u2032 = t \u2212 z / V\u00b1\nand z = z \u2032 specifies the derivations as following\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1 \u2202\nand\n,\n=\n=\n\u00b1\n\u2202t \u2202t \u2032\n\u2202z \u2202z \u2032 V\u00b1 \u2202t \u2032\n\nequation (4) can be re-written as\n\n\u239e\nV\u2212\n4\u03c0 V\u2212 \u2202 2\n\u2202 \u239b\nPS , y (t ) .\n\u239c Eref \u2212 Ein + Etr \u239f = \u2212 2\nV+\n\u2202t \u2032 \u239d\nc \u2202t \u20322\n\u23a0\n\n(5)\n\nEquation (5) can be integrated over time, thus providing the second necessary expression\n\nEref \u2212 Ein +\n\nV\u2212\n4\u03c0 V \u2202\n4\u03c0 V\n\u2202\nEtr = \u2212 2 \u2212\nPS , y (t \u2032) = \u2212 2 \u2212 nS\np(t \u2032) ,\nV+\n\u2202t \u2032\nc \u2202t \u2032\nc\n\n(6)\n\nwhere nS is a surface density of dipole atoms, concerned with a bulk density n A by an approximate\nrelation nA \u2248 nS l , p ( t ) is a polarization per one atom.\nThe atoms of polarizing film are affected by the field Etr (t ) , if the Lorentz field correction is not\naccounted, Ein (t ) is the electric field of a given incident electromagnetic wave.

TWO-LEVEL ATOMS POSSESING PERMANENT DIPOLE MOMENT\nLet us consider a thin film of two-level atoms, similar to one observed in a number of publications22-26, regarding, that unlike the convenient model7, in our case the resonance transition with the\nfrequency \u03c9a is featured by both the non-diagonal and diagonal matrix elements of the dipole tran-\n\n\fsition operator.

EFFECT OF LOCAL FIELD\nThe model considered above does not take into account the influence of the Lorentz local field. To\nmake a simple generalization one, following22,23, can do that by substituting the field acting upon\natoms \u0415 with the local field EL = E + \u03b7 P , where P = ( nS l ) p is bulk polarization of the medium, and\n\n\u03b7 is the form factor responsible for specific features of the environment acting on a given atom. In\nbulk material this factor is 4\u03c0 3 .\nIn terms of normalized variables, the corresponded Bloch equations take the form:\ndr3\ndr1\ndr2\n= \u2212(1 + \u03bc eL )r2 ,\n= (1 + \u03bc eL )r1 + eL r3 ,\n= \u2212eL r2 ,\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\n(13.1)\n\neL = T ein + \u03ba r2 + \u03b7 g < \u03bd + \u03bc > +\u03b7 g < r1 \u2212 \u03bc ( r3 + 1) > ,\n\n(13.2)\n\nwhere g = 2nS d122 l h\u03c90 is the ratio of the energy of dipole-dipole interaction to the energy of resonance transition29. It is accepted that a film is in parelectric phase, i.e. there is no macroscopic dipole moment in it. That means < d11 > =0 . Then finally, the system of equation (13) for further calculation reads\ndr1\ndr2\ndr3\n= \u2212(1 + \u03bc eL )r2 ,\n= (1 + \u03bc eL )r1 + eL r3 ,\n= \u2212eL r2 ,\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\neL = T ein + \u03ba < r2 > + \u03b3 < r1 \u2212 \u03bc ( r3 + 1) > ,\n\n(14.1)\n(14.2)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = \u03b7 g is introduced. At the output the field is calculated with except for local field effect\n\netr = eL \u2212 \u03b3 < r1 \u2212 \u03bc ( r3 + 1) >\n\n(14.3)\n\nNote that system (14.1) describes a precession of vector r over the vector of effective field\n\n\f\u03a9 = {\u2212 eL , 0, 1 + \u03bc eL } ,\n\ndetermined in its turn by the local field (14.2) (fig.1):\n\u2202r\n= [\u03a9 \u00d7 r ] .\n\u2202\u03c4\n\n(15)\n\nIn the absence of the external pulse, the local field is not\nzero that means a permanent precession of Bloch vector\nand, as a sequence, a continuous radiation from the film.\nThe dissipative processes, which are not accounted in\nthis consideration, can drive Bloch vector to equilibrium\n\nFig.1.

It is clear that the\ncloser packing of atoms in film and larger dipole moments will increase the contribution of local\n\n\ffield and enforce the observable effects.

Then vector\nr = (r1 , r2 , r3 ) moves in a manner prescribed by \"free\" ( e0 (t ) =0) equations:\ndr1\ndr3\ndr2\n= \u2212(1 + \u03bc eL )r2 ,\n= (1 + \u03bc eL )r1 + eL r3 ,\n= \u2212eL r2 , eL = \u03ba r2 + \u03b3 ( r1 \u2212 \u03bc ( r3 + 1) ) .\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n\n(17)\n\nSolutions (17) meet the trajectories on Bloch sphere fixed by expression (16).

A stationary state (fig. 5b) corresponds to the focusing of the solution (fig.\n4b) to x coordinate, which is the root of (25) for \u03bc = \u22121 (fig. 6d)\n\n\f8. THIN LAYER STATE SWITCHING\nAn existence of new stationary states in inversion and polarization of the layer of atoms possessing\npermanent dipole moment (fig. 4 (curves for \u03b3 =1.1, 1.3, 1.5), fig.5b) prompts that the analogy between the quantum object (14) (fig. 2) and a mechanical pendulum \u0441an be applicable even beyond\nthe linear model (20) in solving a complete system (14) with the noticeable deviation of Bloch vector from an equilibrium state.\n\n(\u0430)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\nFig. 6. Zero-level lines of function F(x,y)\n\nSo, the behavior of physical pendulum with the account of friction ( \u03b2 ) and the moment of external\nforce ( M ) conventionally looks:\nd 2\u03c8\nd\u03c8\n= \u2212\u03c9 2 sin\u03c8 \u2212 2 \u03b2\n+ M (\u03c4 ) ,\n2\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\nwhere \u03c8 is the angle of deflection of a pendulum from vertical. With the increase of initial velocity\n\n\u03c8 \u2032 ( 0 ) up to the critical values (fig. 8a,b) the pendulum under the slightest alternation of initial ve-\n\n\flocity \"switches\" to one of stationary state: either it makes the revolution \u03c8 =2\u03c0 , or it gets back to a\nstationary state \u03c8 =0.\nThe time slowdown (fig. 8a,b), characteristic for the solutions whose phase trajectories are close to\nseparatrix, has the durations, which can be made very\nlong by appropriate choice of initial velocity and by the\nincrease of damping factor. Either short-term (fig. 8\u0441), or\npermanent application of external force moment (fig. 8d)\ncan switch over a pendulum to another stationary state. In\nthe latter case, a constant moment of external force defines stationary position and this state does not equal to\n2\u03c0. In the problem under consideration the Bloch vector\n\nr while precessing about the vector of effective field\nmoves over the Bloch sphere like a physical pendulum,\nfollowing the direction of \u03a9 .\nThe local field eL (\u03c4 ) (14.2) includes the incident external field e0 , the induced polarization \u03ba r2 , and the\nproper internal local field \u03b3(r1-\u03bc(r3+1)) is responsible for\nthe effect of moment of external force. Under the low ini-\n\nFig. 7. The stationary points of focus type\nassosiated with different initial conditions.\n\ntial velocities \u03c8 \u2032 ( 0 ) of pendulum, as well as for\nthe small values of local field parameter \u03b3 , solution of (17) exhibits damping oscillations (fig. 3).\nAt \u03b3 >1 the rest state r0 = (0,0, \u22121) , in the\nframes of linear analysis (21,22) looses its robustness, however the complete system of equations\n(14) possesses new, distinguished from r0 , stationary points. Under the minimal initial deviation\nfrom r0 (external field is absent) the solutions\nchanges barely noticeable over the prolonged interval like the motion in viscous medium.\nOn the XY-trajectory (fig. 9\u0430 (inset)) the slowdown is depicted by the closeness of dots. As soon\nas r3 starts growing, the whole corrections to local\nFig. 8. Solutions of pendulum equations for different\nconditions of pendulum excitation\n\nfield \u03b3 ( r1 \u2212 \u03bc ( r3 + 1) ) starts growing as well be-\n\n\fcause \u03bc < 0 .\nThe quantum system shifts from unstable equilibrium and after the slowdown a quick switch\nover to a robust equilibrium state follows as the graphic on fig. 6c prescribes (fig.9\u0430). The dynamics of quantum system reminds a transition of a\npendulum to the new equilibrium state\nby application a moment of external\npermanent force (fig. 8d). The layer\nradiates a time-delayed oscillatory signal. The duration of delayed motion\nabout the unstable equilibrium state\nshortens with the increase of both parameter \u03b3 and the absolute value of\nStark parameter \u03bc because the local\nfield grows. With the change of sign of\nStark parameter \u03bc and the decrease of\n\n\u03b3 effect vanishes.\nIt is clear that the analogy of the\nquantum system under consideration to\nmechanical pendulum is not a detailed\none. So, if a physical pendulum can be\n\nFig. 9. a - The switch over of the film state under the action of\ninternal local field. b - rapid Rabi oscillation of the Bloch vector\ncomponents affected by a strong external pulse.\n\nstimulated to make a turn by applying an appropriate moment of force of short duration (fig. 8\u0441),\none manage to transfer a quantum pendulum to a new stationary state only if \u03b3 \u2260 0. Else the action\nof external field leads only to rapid Rabi oscillation of the Bloch vector components in pulse duration time (fig. 9b). At this time, a videopulse essentially acts as a trigger creating a seed inversion r3\nand polarization r1 to generate internal local field.\nUnder non-zero values of the local field parameter \u03b3 the probability of switch over from the\nmain state r0 to other stationary state depends in a threshold manner on the level of excitation (the\nvalues of r3) the pulse has left the medium at. As soon as inversion oscillates in the field of videopulse, it can happen that to the end of the pulse atoms of the film are weakly excited and a switch\ndoes not occur even under the influence of a strong pulse or vice versa. However, in general, the\nrise of amplitude of incident pulse increases the probability of a switch in a layer transmittance. For\ninstance, in fig. 10 parameter \u03b3 is small and to observe a switch one should choose greater absolute\n\n\fvalues of Stark parameter \u03bc (fig. 6a and fig.4c). The manifest change in film transmittance are well\nnoticed in the difference between two phase diagrams of the processes (fig. 10\u0430,\u0441 insets).\nNaturally, the rotation angle of the\neffective field vector \u03a9 (fig.1) goes\ndown to - \u03c0 (fig. 10\u0430), i.e. to the end\nof the process vector r directs to the\nnorth pole of the Bloch sphere,\nwhereas for the low levels of excitation the medium of a layer returns in\nthe rest state with angle \u03b1 goes to\nzero (fig. 10c).\nIn view of distinguished variance\nin the transition of atoms of the layer\nfrom one stationary state to another\nunder the action of pulse field of different strength the dependence of\ntransmittivity\n\nWtr / Win , where W is\n\nthe pulse energy, against pulse amplitude experiences pulsations (fig.11)\noriginated from the changes of film\ntransmittance regime. With the inFig.10. The switch over effect for small local field parameter\n\n\u03b3\n\ncrease of amplitudes of videopulse\n\nthe transmittance tends Fresnel limit T=0.8 for current calculations. That means the film is getting\nmore transparent for stronger pulses. This is the characteristic feature of other planar structure containing resonance particle24.\nAs it was pointed out above under condition \u03b3 < 1 there are intervals of parameter \u03bc , where the\nonly stationary point is \u2013 (x = 0,y = 0). It follows from the plots in fig. 6a,b, where, for example, the\nsecond stationary point appears as the intersection of the curve x(\u03bc) with vertical line\u03bc =-1 after the\nslightest increase of \u03b3 .\nThe trajectories of system (14) under such critical values of \u03b3 pass nearby separatrix, that corresponds to the passage of pendulum close to the unstable equilibrium position. The speed of such\nmotion is very low, thus the time to transfer to initial rest position, the delay time, (fig.12 lower\npanel) is very long (fig.13). The corresponding dependence of delay time vs \u03b3 perfectly fits the reciprocal power law with the critical parameter \u03b3 c =0.4587.\n\n\fThe position of stable equilibrium r0 turns to be a\nknot (fig.12 upper panel), where solution gets over\nwithout oscillations. The decay of induced polarization while getting in stationary state causes an enlightening of a weak pulse of delayed radiation at the end\nof the Bloch vector motion (fig.12 lower panel). In fig.\n12 the 3D picture on the middle demonstrates the temporal dynamics of the transmitted radiation under continuous alternation of local field parameter \u03b3 . The remarkable feature of this dependence is a fast, threshold\nappearance of the delayed signal when \u03b3 approaches\nto critical value \u03b3 c . The analogous threshold dependences in transmitted radiation take place under variaFig.11. Transmission coefficient vs videopulse\namplitude.\n\ntion of \u03bc and \u03ba , as both parameters affect the local\nfield strength.\n\n7. CONCLUSION\nIn conclusion the propagation of videopulse through a thin layer of two-level spectrally homogeneous atoms possessing permanent dipole moments is\nnumerically considered. The approximation of slow\namplitudes and rotating waves are lifted. It turns out\nthat the combination of three distinguish factors: the\nultimate shortness of excited videopulse, the principal\nimportance of local field effect in thin film physics,\nand the presence of permanent dipole moment in\natomic subsystem gives rise to the effect of delayed\npulsed electromagnetic radiation when the delay time\nis many times longer than all charachteristic temporal\nparameters in the problem under consideration.\nAn evident analogy with nonlinear mechanical pendulum permits to suppose that we meet the unique situation when local Lorentz field, which includes the effect of permanent dipoles, drives quantum system\nfrom one stationary state to another.\n\nFig. 12. The delay effect near critical value of\nlocal field parameter \u03b3\n\n\fA very long delay can be explained by a very slow motion of quantum system near unstable\nequilibrium. The effect has a threshold character over the strength of local field and depends upon the sign of Stark parameter \u03bc.\nThe integral curves of film energy transmittivity vs pulse field amplitude tends to\nFresnel coefficient for given interface that\nagrees with a conventional result24 when the\nstronger are the amplitudes of short pulses of\nelectromagnetic radiation, the better a thin\nfilm of resonance particles transmits and\nworse reflects.\n\nFig. 13.
