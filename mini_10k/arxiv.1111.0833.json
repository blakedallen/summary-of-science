In this way\nnear-infrared (NIR) laser pulses of 800 nm wavelength can provide a broad spectral plateau of extreme ultraviolet\n(XUV) radiation ending in a cutoff. The minimum pulse duration is determined by the achievable bandwidth (i.e. the\nposition of the cutoff) and the chirp of the produced radiation. The cutoff scales with the intensity, but the extension\nof the cutoff by increase in the laser intensity is limited by the depletion and phase matching problems arising in the\nionized medium. An alternative method demonstrated to produce higher harmonic orders is by using longer pump\npulse wavelength, with the disadvantage of decreased efficiency [4].\nFor a monochromatic field an attosecond pulse is created every half cycle of the generating laser pulse [5]. To\nproduce single attosecond pulses (SAPs) for clean pump-probe studies, very short - few cycle - laser pulses have to\nbe used [3, 6, 7]. Such short laser pulses are hard to obtain reliably, therefore alternative ways have been developed\nto gate high-order harmonic generation, restricting the XUV production to a single half-cycle and thus leading to\nSAPs. The first technique to provide SAP generation used intensity gating, selecting the cutoff region of the radiation\nproduced by a few-cycle pulse, with only a half-cycle contribution [6]. Polarization gating proved to be an efficient\ntechnique for achieving SAP production with long laser pulses [8\u201310]. Ionization gating is another way to produce\nSAP, based on the principle that by use of very high laser intensities the medium is depleted on the rising edge of the\npulse [11, 12].\nAnother way is two color gating, which is obtained by combining two or more laser pulses having different wavelengths and usually different intensities [13]. The electromagnetic field of the stronger laser pulse (commonly from a\nTi:Sapphire laser at 800 nm wavelength) is called the driving field, while that of the weaker one is the control field.\nThe role of the latter usually is to control the movement of the electrons while away from the nucleus, preventing or\nhelping recombination, or to control the exact time of the ionization by which the duration, intensity and also the\nchirp of the produced harmonic pulse can be affected. The combination of a short laser pulse with an even shorter\nultraviolet or extreme ultraviolet pulse was demonstrated to be an efficient technique to control the time of ionization\n[14, 15]. The wavelength of the control field can also be longer than that of the driving field as demonstrated by Vozzi\net al. [16] and Calegari et al. [17].\nThe fast development of terahertz (THz) pulse production by difference frequency generation made it possible to\nobtain extremely strong, long wavelength fields, the electric field reaching 100 MV/cm [18]. The method described\nby Sell et al. [18] also enables the tuning of the resulting field's wavelength in a wide range, down to the mid-infrared\ndomain. The strength of the electric field obtained by this method is already comparable with that of the laser\npulses traditionally used when high-order harmonics are produced in gases, therefore it may alter the HHG process\nconsiderably.\nThe effects of using THz and static electric fields in HHG at single atom level have been investigated in several\npapers [19\u201324]. In this work, we further investigate the idea at the macroscopic level, by considering all the important\neffects arising during the propagation of electromagnetic fields, simulating a scenario with realistic focusing geometry.\nThe strong field approximation (SFA) [25] is used to calculate the dipole radiation from individual atoms, the nonadiabatic saddle point approximation [26] to analyze electron trajectories, and propagation effects in the laser, THz,\nand harmonic fields are taken into account when the wave equation is solved for them [27, 28]. We calculate harmonic\ngeneration in Ne atoms, with few cycle, near infrared pulses having a peak intensity of 6-10\u22171014 W/cm2 and 800\nnm wavelength. The peak amplitude of the THz field is 100 MV/cm, which is the highest field strength currently\navailable [18].\nThis paper is organized as follows: In section II the model used to simulate high-order harmonic generation in a\nmacroscopic medium is presented. In section III the main parameters of the model are presented, followed by the\nresults in the single atom case, and also the generated harmonic bursts arriving at the exit of the interaction region.\nThe last part of section III focuses on the interpretation of the results by analyzing phase matching effects arising\nduring the process. In section IV the prospects and limits of the method are discussed, followed by the conclusions\nin section V.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nAs mentioned before, the process of high-order harmonic generation is well understood using the three step model\n[29], which pictures HHG as the result of (1) tunneling ionization, (2) free electron movement in the laser field, and\n(3) recombination. Since the electric field of the laser pulse is comparable with the Coulomb field of the atom, at\ncertain phases of the laser field the outermost electron may tunnel into the continuum. In the second step the free\n2\n\n\felectron is driven by the sinusoidal electric force of the laser, and first accelerated away from the nucleus, then pulled\nback toward the parent ion on the change of the sign of the electric field. Revisiting the parent ion the electron may\nrecombine and release its energy in the form of a high energy photon.\nThe exact treatment for describing the emitted radiation from the interaction of the laser pulse with a single atom\nis to solve the time dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Use of the SFA of Lewenstein et al. [25] enables easier numerical\ntreatment and interpretation of the results while still reproducing the main aspects of the process. The analytical\nsimplification to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, proven to be valid in conditions under which high-order harmonics are\ngenerated, gives a simpler formula for the time dependent dipole moment. The method is widely used when the\nprocess of HHG is analyzed, especially if macroscopic effects are taken into account which needs the calculation of the\nsingle atom response to be done at least thousands of times making the use of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation impractical.\nThe Lewenstein integral for the time dependent dipole moment reads:\nn Z\nd(t) = 2Re i\n\nt\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndt\u2032\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00113/2\no\n\u03c0\n\u2217\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nd\n[p\n(t\n,\nt)\n\u2212\nA(t)]d[p\n(t\n,\nt)\n\u2212\nA(t\n)]exp[\u2212iS\n(t\n,\nt)]E(t\n)\nst\nst\nst\n\u01eb + i(t \u2212 t\u2032 )/2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E(t) and A(t) denote the time dependent electric field and vector potential of the laser pulse, d(p) denotes the\natomic dipole matrix element for the bound-free transition, \u01eb being a small positive number to remove the divergence\nat t = t\u2032 , while pst is the stationary point of the canonical momentum, and S(t\u2032 , t) is the quasiclassical action defined\nas:\n!\nZ t\n(p(t\u2032\u2032 ) \u2212 A(t\u2032\u2032 ))2\n\u2032\n(2)\n+ Ip dt\u2032\u2032 ,\nS(t , t) = i\n2\nt\u2032\nIp being the ionization potential.\nThe harmonic emission spectrum is obtained as the Fourier transform of the time dependent dipole moment, which\nis filtered from low order harmonics for which the formula is not accurate. The temporal shape of the produced\nattosecond pulses is calculated by inverse Fourier transform of the harmonic field in a given spectral range.\nIn Equation 1 the dipole moment is calculated taking into account all electron trajectories, on which the electron\nleaves the atom before time t and recombines with the parent ion exactly at t. However, it was found that only a few\nof these infinite number of trajectories are actually relevant (the stationary points of the phase), therefore by selecting\nonly these, and approximating the value of the integral using the saddle point approximation [25, 26, 30, 31] further\ninformation can be obtained that makes possible the trajectory analysis. The first two trajectories with the shortest\ntravel time are distinguished as the most important ones, and are called the short and long trajectories. Those having\na travel time more than one optical cycle are usually called superlong trajectories.\nWe found that the effect of superlong trajectories can be important, at least at single atom level, which is not\nsurprising since Tate et al. described it [4]. Therefore the Lewenstein integral was calculated for a time period as\nlong as 3 optical cycles of the fundamental NIR field. Further increase in the length of the time domain causes no\nconsiderable change in the resulting spectra, or in the synthesized harmonic pulses.\nIn order to include the effect of propagation on the laser, THz and harmonic fields the corresponding wave equations\nin paraxial approximation were solved for all of them. The detailed description of the fundamentals of this method\nhas been given by Priori et al. [27] taking into account the ionization and plasma dispersion. This has been completed\nby including the effects of absorption, dispersion on atoms and the optical Kerr effect by Takahashi et al. [28]. In our\ncase the propagation of the laser and THz fields cannot be completely separated, since the optical Kerr effect and the\nionization depend on the total electric field to which the atoms are exposed, therefore related quantities are calculated\nfor the combined field before solving the wave equation. In this study the ADK model is used for calculating the\nionization rate [32]. The trajectory analysis for arbitrary laser fields using saddle point approximation, which is also\nincluded, was described in [31].\nIII.\n\nCONFIGURATION AND RESULTS\n\nIn the configuration we assumed, the laser pulse has a central wavelength of 800 nm while the wavelength of THz\nfield is 8 \u03bcm (corresponding to 37.5 THz). In the two main cases the peak intensity of the IR field is 6 \u2217 1014 W/cm2\nproduced by 0.3 mJ, 5.2 fs (or 0.47 mJ, 8 fs) pulses of a beam of 2 mm diameter, focused by a mirror of 0.6 m focal\ndistance, resulting in a beam waist of 76 \u03bcm in the focus with a Rayleigh range of 22.9 mm. The peak amplitude of\nthe THz field is 100 MV/cm, a value obtained experimentally by Sell et al. [18].\nBoth the IR and THz pulses are treated as Gaussian beams, focused at the same spot. The 1 mm long gas cell\ncontaining neon gas with a pressure of 15 Torr is placed right after the focus. To have the best spatial overlap between\n3\n\n\fthe two pulses, the THz field is focused to have the same 76 \u03bcm beam waist, resulting in a Rayleigh range of 2.29\nmm. Both pulses propagate in the same direction, having parallel linear polarization, and are synchronized so their\npeaks overlap at the focus. When the limits of the method or certain aspects of the process were tested, some of these\nparameters were changed, as specified later.\n\nA.\n\nTerahertz and laser field propagation\n\nHigh-order harmonic generation relies on the process of recapturing the optically ionized electron after its propagation in the laser field. The characteristics of the radiation are ultimately dependent on the electric field to which\nthe atoms are exposed. During the propagation through the gas cell, several linear and nonlinear effects may disturb\nthe laser and THz pulses, such as absorption, dispersion on atoms, the optical Kerr effect, and dispersion on electrons\n(plasma dispersion). The effect of the plasma dispersion is particularly important in the case of low frequency fields\nlike the THz field, because this effect scales with (\u03c9p /\u03c9)2 (where \u03c9p is the angular plasma frequency, and \u03c9 is the\nangular frequency of the propagated field).\nThe results show that under the conditions we proposed, the IR field is almost unchanged during the propagation,\nbecause the ionization is quite low, and the pulse's Rayleigh length is much longer than the gas cell. At the exit of\nthe interaction region (after 1 mm propagation) the peak of the pulse on axis is ahead by 16 as, which is mostly\ncaused by the Gouy phase shift that yields an 18.5 as change in the same direction.\n500\n\n500\n\nIR pulse\n\n-500\n100\n\ninitial THz field\n\n(a)\n\nfinal at 4.2% ionization\nfinal at 22% ionization\n\n50\n\n0\n\n-50\n\n-100\n-40\n\nIR pulse\n\n0\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nField amplitude (MV/cm)\n\nField amplitude (MV/cm)\n\n0\n\n-500\n100\n\ninitial field\n\n50\n\n0\n\n-50\nfinal at 0.0% ionization\nfinal at 4.2% ionization\n\n-100\n-5\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\n(b)\n\nfinal at 22% ionization\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\nFIG. 1.

The upper\ninsets show the incident laser field for the 6 \u2217 1014 W/cm2 case. (b) Central portion of the THz pulse's electric field in the focus\n(black solid line), and after 1 mm propagation in a medium with 0% (green dash-dotted line), 4.2% (red dashed line), and 22%\n(blue dotted line) ionization, indicating the strong distortion of the THz field due to ionization right after the peak of the IR\npulse.\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 1(a) the macroscopic effects are much more evident in the case of the THz field. Because\nof the 2.29 mm Rayleigh range, the Gouy phase shift is 0.4 radians at 1 mm from the focus, which yields a 1.74 fs\nshift of the pulse's peak, referenced to a plane wave propagating in vacuum. Since the plasma dispersion scales with\n\u03bb2 even a reasonably small ionization leads to a considerable distortion of the THz field. As the dominant part of\nthe ionization happens when the IR field is present and especially around the peak of the IR pulse, the part of the\nTHz pulse after this peak propagates through a medium with much higher electron density than the leading edge,\ntherefore the effect of plasma dispersion is also considerably higher. This effect can be observed by comparing cases\nwith weaker and stronger IR fields i.e. lower and higher ionization. When a 5.2 fs long IR pulse is used with 6 \u2217 1014\nW/cm2 peak intensity (causing 4.2% ionization on axis) the main cause of the distortions is the short Rayleigh range,\nhowever with a peak intensity of 1015 W/cm2 the total ionization is 21.7% and the trailing edge of the THz pulse\nsuffers from the effects of plasma dispersion. This can be seen in Figure 1 where the initial field at the focus and\nthe propagated fields at the exit of the interaction region (1 mm) are compared showing that the plasma dispersion\nintroduces a significant blue-shift and loss of pulse energy during propagation. With longer, 8 fs pulses the ionization\nrate at 6 \u2217 1014 W/cm2 is still just 5.8% leaving the Gouy phase shift the main cause of distortion.\n4\n\n\fB.\n\nSingle atom response and attosecond pulses in the near field\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n-19\n\n(a)\n\nz = 0 mm\nz = 1 mm\n\n-20\n\nIR only\n\n93 eV\n\n-21\n\n70 eV\n\n-22\n-23\n-24\n-25\n\n23 eV\n-26\n\nPower\n\n10\n\n-18\n\n-5\n\nx10\n\n-27\n-28\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n3x10\n2x10\n1x10\n\n-12\n\nIR\n\n(b)\n-12\n\n330 as\n\n-12\n\n0\n(e)\n\n15\n10\n\nx2\n\n225 as\n\n190 as\n\n5\n0\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\nTime (o.c. of IR)\n\nHarmonic order\n\nIR+THz\n\n(d)\nx2\n\n360 as\n\n20 (c)\n(arb. units)\n\nEmission rate (arb. units)\n\n10\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nThe effect of THz fields on high-order harmonic generation has been investigated at the single atom level using the\nclassical model [20], semi-classical model [33], using zero range potential calculations [19], SFA together with saddle\npoint approximation [24] and by solving the time dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a model atom [20\u201323]. In this\nsection we summarize these results briefly and present the single atom response calculated with our parameters by\nnumerically integrating the Lewenstein integral (Equation 1). The propagated, and radially integrated intensities of\nthe harmonic bursts at the exit of the interaction region (i.e. in the near field), hence including all the macroscopic\neffects, are also presented here.\nAddition of a static electric or THz field to the generating laser pulse breaks the half-cycle symmetry of the HHG\nprocess, and leads to the appearance of both odd and even harmonics in the spectrum [20, 21]. The additional low\nfrequency field can prevent the closing of some trajectories and if the laser pulse is short enough a broad supercontinuum may appear in the spectra, which leads to the generation of single attosecond pulses. As reported in [22]\nthe origin of this supercontinuum is radiation from recombining electrons passing through short trajectories, the THz\nfield suppressing the emission from the corresponding long ones. It is also observed that with a strong negative chirp\nof the laser pulse, the width of this supercontinuum may be further increased to obtain a flat spectrum as wide as 700\nharmonic orders [22]. However laser pulses and static electric fields used by Xiang et al. [22] are not yet available,\nhence we focused our study on longer laser pulses without chirp and THz pulses instead of static electric fields.\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\nTime (o.c. of IR)\n\nFIG. 2. (Color online) (a) Harmonic spectra from a single atom, generated at the beginning (black solid line) and at the end\n(red dashed line) of the cell obtained by using a 5.2 fs IR laser pulse combined with the 100 MV/cm THz pulse. The spectrum\non the bottom (blues dash-dotted line) shifted 5 orders of magnitude downward shows the generated spectrum by the same IR\npulse but without the THz field. (b) The resulting attosecond pulse from the single atom response for the case without the\nTHz field, and (c) the propagated and radially integrated harmonic field intensity at the exit of the interaction region (also\nin the case with only the IR field present). Figure (d) shows the attosecond pulse from the single atom response and (e) the\npropagated and radially integrated harmonic field intensity (resulting power) at the exit of the interaction region for the case\nwith the THz pulse. The attosecond bursts were synthesized by selecting harmonic orders \u226581 from the harmonic spectra.\n\nSAPs can be obtained without the need of advanced gating techniques and control fields, 'just' by using adequate\nspectral filtering, and sufficiently short laser pulses. For example, a 5.2 fs laser field with 6\u22171014 W/cm2 peak intensity,\ngenerates a harmonic spectrum with a cutoff around the 90th order (see Figure 2(a)). By selection of harmonics \u226581\nan isolated attosecond pulse can be obtained at the single atom level (see Figure 2(b)). For our conditions of cell\nlength, pressure and ionization level, propagation does not distort the laser field. Additionally, the cell starts at the\nfocus and we select cutoff harmonics, so the conditions for good phase matching are met [34, 35], thus a Gaussian-like\npulse is observed in the near field. The duration of this pulse is 360 as produced at single atom level which becomes\n225 as in the near field. We note here, that attosecond pulses synthesized from the cutoff posses no chirp [3, 36].\nIncreasing the spectral window leads to the appearance of two additional attosecond pulses at half-cycle delay before\nand after the central one.\nOn addition of the 100 MV/cm THz field, the spectrum is reshaped to a two-plateau structure, one ending at\naround order 81 and the other extending its cutoff to harmonic 135; the calculations reveal that the two plateaus are\ngenerated in consecutive half-cycles.

Although the spectrum is much wider than in the IR alone case, the presence of both trajectories and\ntheir phase modulation (chirp) produces a pulse duration comparable to that in the IR only case.

(b) The resulting attosecond pulse from single atom\nresponse obtained by selecting harmonics \u226581, and (c) the propagated and radially integrated harmonic field intensity at the\nexit of the interaction region showing a clean SAP. The inset in logarithmic scale shows a contrast of almost 102 between the\nmain pulse and the second most powerful one.\n\nWhen a longer laser pulse is used (8 fs, with the same 6\u22171014 W/cm2 peak intensity, containing 0.45 mJ energy), the\npart of the spectra from orders 80 to 100 becomes more modulated, suggesting the interference of more trajectories.\nUsing the same spectral filter as before (\u226581), we obtain three distinct attosecond pulses generated at the single-atom\nlevel. However only the central one survives the propagation, and can be seen at the exit of the interaction region\nhaving considerable intensity. The details of the macroscopic effects responsible for the cleaning and shortening of\nthe attosecond bursts are discussed in the following subsection.\nC.\n\nPhase matching effects\n\nDue to the distortion of the THz field during propagation, the harmonic generation conditions vary substantially\nalong the axial coordinate. The selection of the central burst seen in Figure 3(b) in the 8 fs case also suggests that\nphase matching promotes only a distinct class of trajectories, and the others are eliminated because of destructive\ninterference. In order to investigate phase matching of the single atom spectra during propagation, the propagated\nand radially integrated harmonic intensities (power density spectra) are plotted at different axial (z) coordinates\nfor the 6 \u2217 1014 W/cm2 case, see Figure 4. For harmonics up to the order of 115 the spectral power increases with\npropagation distance, suggesting good phase matching for the whole length of the cell. On the other hand for the\nhighest harmonics there is no increase for the second part of the cell.\nAnalyzing the spatial structure of different harmonics along the r and z axes, one can see where good phase matching\nconditions are fulfilled for a specific harmonic (see Figure 5). These maps show for example that the intensities of\nharmonics from order 81 to 101, which belong to the lower part of the plateau, undergo a constant increase along the\npropagation direction with the best rate slightly off axis. Harmonic 121 is phase matched close to the beam axis but\nonly in the first part of the medium, while after 8\u030300 \u03bcm of propagation the field intensity decreases. The reason for\nthis decrease is the phase mismatch of the specific harmonic and not the reabsorption of harmonic radiation by the\nmedium. This claim is supported by the fact that the cutoff on axis is still slightly above harmonic 121 at the exit of\nthe interaction region and the absorption length is larger than 20 mm for this frequency and in these conditions.\n6\n\n\f5\n\n10\n\nPower spectrum (arb. units)\n\n(a)\n10\n\nz = 0.2 mm\nz = 0.5 mm\n\n4\n\nz = 1.0 mm\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n10\n\nz = 0.2 mm\nz = 0.5 mm\n\n4\n\nz = 1.0 mm\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n140\n\n5\n\n(b)\n\nPower spectrum (arb. units)\n\n10\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n40\n\n60\n\nHarmonic order\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\nHarmonic order\n\nFIG. 4.

(Color online) Spectral intensity of the propagated harmonic field as a function of radial and axial (z) coordinate for\nharmonic 81 (a), 101 (b) and 121 (c) calculated for generation with the 8 fs laser pulse.\n\nWe can conclude that the spectral power density in the lower and middle part of the plateau increases through\nthe propagation, but this analysis is not conclusive on whether phase matching conditions promote certain sets of\ntrajectories. This would have a strong effect on the shape, duration and chirp of the resulting pulses.\nIt is well documented that in HHG with only the IR laser pulse, mainly short trajectory components survive the\npropagation in a long interaction region, especially after focus, however, in gas cells only a few millimeters long, the\ncontribution of long trajectories to the final pulse might still be significant [37] in specific conditions. The shortor long-trajectory origin of the resulting burst is important since it defines the temporal, and may alter the spatial\nproperties of the resulting attosecond pulses. Attosecond bursts from short/long trajectories have positive/negative\nchirp [38]. Likewise, radiation generated from short/long trajectories usually has a lower/higher divergence [39, 40],\nmaking radiation from short trajectories more suitable for applications. Therefore it is important to investigate\nwhether short or long trajectory components survive the propagation through a 1 mm long gas cell.\nWe mentioned in the previous subsection that the high frequency part of the single dipole spectrum (\u226581 harmonic\norder) consist of two sets of trajectories. This is visible in the temporal profile of the attosecond burst - obtained by\nFourier transforming the filtered complex spectra - where the presence of short and long trajectories is observable as\ntwo separate peaks at a delay less than half IR optical cycle.\nWe present in the upper row of Figure 6 the (t, r) map of the single dipole bursts produced by an 8 fs pulse at\n6 \u2217 1014 W/cm2 at different propagation distances in the gas cell. We observe that the short- and long- trajectory\ncomponents merge into the cutoff while the radial coordinate increases(corresponding to decreasing field strength).\nWe indicate in Figure 6(a) the short- and long-trajectory classes, as deduced from the trajectory analysis. As the laser\nand THz intensity decreases along the propagation direction (due to beam divergence and plasma defocusing), there is\nno change in the generation of the central attosecond burst, whereas the post pulse strength decreases along the cell.\n7\n\n\fThis can be attributed to the accentuated decrease of the THz field amplitude and phase shift during propagation\nin the ionized medium, which decreases the cutoff at that specific half-cycle to near the lower limit of the spectral\ndomain from which the harmonic burst is synthesized. The inner structure appearing inside the attosecond bursts is\nattributed to interference from different electron trajectories.\nThe same set of plots has been produced for the propagated harmonic fields (bottom row of Figure 6) to study\nthe effect of phase matching. Two bursts separated by an IR cycle are observed, similar to the single atom results\nabove. While the main burst is building up during propagation, the strength of the post pulse is decreasing suggesting\nunfavored phase matching. Most importantly we would like to point out that, although long trajectory components\nare generated at any axial coordinate along the cell (top graphs in Figure 6), they gradually disappear from the\npropagated field, suggesting phase mismatch for these emissions. We conclude that harmonic emissions from electrons\ntraveling along short trajectories are well phase matched during propagation, while those from long trajectories are\ngradually eliminated by destructive interference.\n\n40\n\n50\n(b)\n\nz = 0.2 mm\n\n40\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\nshort\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\nlong\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n0\n-1.0\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n40\n\nx5\n\n20\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\n\n1.5\n\n0.90\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n0\n-1.0\n\nz = 1.0 mm\n\n40\n\nx2\n\n30\n\n-0.5\n\n0.50\n\n(f)\n\nz = 0.5 mm\n\n30\n\n-1.0\n\n0.40\n\n0\n-1.0\n\n30\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\n0.10\n0.30\n\n50\n(e)\n\nz = 0.2 mm\n\n0.00\n\n1.00\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\n50\n(d)\n\n40\n\n-0.5\n\nz = 1.0 mm\n\n0.20\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\n50\nRadial coordinate ( m)\n\n(c)\n\nz = 0.5 mm\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\n50\n(a)\n\n1.5\n\n0\n-1.0\n\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nRadial coordinate ( m)\n\n50\n\n0.90\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.00\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\nFIG. 6.

The peak\namplitude of the THz field was 100 MV/cm. By selecting harmonic orders \u226581 this configuration yielded a SAP with\n185 as duration and a contrast ratio of 85:1. In each of the following subsections the effects of varying one parameter\nis discussed, except in section IV C where the delay between the IR and THz pulses and the length of the interaction\nregion are discussed together.\n\nA.\n\nLaser pulse duration\n\nFor the duration of the IR pulse, it seems that the shorter the pulse the better for the positive effects of the THz\nfield, although we did not explore extremal cases like sub-cycle pulses. Using 5.2 fs laser pulses the continuum part\nin the near field spectrum starts at the 71st harmonic order and therefore a much wider spectral range can be used\n8\n\n\fPower\n\n12 fs laser\n\n10 fs laser\n-12\n\n2.0x10\n\n(a)\n\n15 fs laser\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n-12\n\n1.5x10\n\n-12\n\n1.0x10\n\n-13\n\n5.0x10\n\n0.0\n~200 as\n\n20 (d)\n(arb. units)\n\nIntensity (arb. units)\n\nfor SAP production. However, because of the chirp of the resulting harmonic pulse, the wider spectral range does not\ndecrease the duration of the obtained SAP, this can be balanced by eliminating cutoff harmonics by spectral filtering.\nFor example, for a 5.2 fs pulse and selecting harmonic orders 81-115 a 160 as pulse is predicted. To take advantage\nof the broad bandwidth an XUV pulse shaping method needs to be implemented [41, 42] to obtain transform limited\npulses. With a suitable chirp compensation technique the IR only SAP duration of 225 as is reduced to 210 as, while\nthe 185 as pulse generated in the presence of the THz field is reduced to just \u224850 as.\n\n~210 as\n\n(e)\n\n~190 as\n\n(f)\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-2\n\nx45\n\nx40\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nx15\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nx21\n\nx8\n\nx28\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTime (o.c. of IR laser)\n\nFIG. 7.

Using the same spectral filtering\n(harmonics \u226581) and 10 fs laser pulse the contrast is decreased to 40:1 and this ratio is further decreased to 15:1 with\n12 fs, and to 8:1 with 15 fs pulses.

(Color online) Radially integrated spectral intensity of the propagated field after different lengths of the gas cell for\n25, 35 and 50 Torr gas pressure showing the detrimental effect of high gas pressure on the phase matching of cutoff harmonics.\n\nThe increase of the gas pressure has a detrimental effect for the phase matching in the high frequency range thus\nnarrowing the spectral range available for SAP generation. However the harmonics involved in SAP formation is closer\nto the cutoff so the resulting SAP duration is decreased. We found that the optimum pressure in terms of contrast\nratio is around 25 Torr. At this pressure the contrast is increased to 170:1, the peak power of the SAP is doubled\nand its duration is reduced to 165 as when the same spectral filtering as before is used. On further increase of the\ngas pressure the pulse duration is further decreased to 140 and 130 as with 35 and 50 Torr gas pressure respectively;\nhowever, this also results in a decrease in contrast to 130:1 and 35:1.\n9\n\n\fC.\n\nDelay between THz and IR pulses and optimal cell length\n\nAnother important parameter is the length of the interaction region, the optimal value of which is limited by phase\nmatching conditions and reabsorption. With the base configuration where the Rayleigh range of the THz pulse is\n2.29 mm the most powerful SAP can be obtained with a 1.3 mm long cell. In this case the near field SAP duration\nis reduced to 150 as and the contrast is increased to 130:1.\nBy change in the delay from -2.0 fs (IR pulse behind) to 1.5 fs (IR pulse ahead) the near field cutoff is increased\nfrom harmonic 85 to 125. When the IR is 1.5 fs ahead, the near field spectral power density for harmonics in the\ncutoff region is increased 4.5 times compared to the case without delay (using a 1 mm cell in both cases). However,\nby putting the IR pulse ahead of the THz by 1.5 fs, the optimal cell length (in terms of harmonic pulse power) is also\nincreased from 1.3 to 2 mm. In this case the harmonic pulse's peak power is doubled, the duration of the obtained\nSAP is 150 as, and the contrast is 75:1.\n\nD.\n\nLaser pulse energy\n\nBy increasing IR pulse energy we could still generate SAP and favorable phase matching for the short trajectories. Of\ncourse, due to the increased cutoff we also adjusted the spectral filtering for an optimum SAP generation. With 8\u22171014\nW/cm2 peak intensity for the 8 fs pulse, the result is 16.4% peak ionization and a 165 as SAP having a contrast of\n230:1 when harmonics \u2265101 are selected. By further increasing peak intensity to 1015 W/cm2 the resulting ionization\nis 32%, (compared to 21.7% in Figure 1(b) with a 5.2 fs laser pulse having the same peak intensity) which affects the\nTHz field propagation in its trailing edge. The gating effect of the THz pulse is still present, and a SAP with 150\nas duration and a contrast of 100:1 is obtained in the near field by selecting harmonics \u2265111. In this case the single\natom cutoff is at harmonic order 191, although by the end of the 1 mm gas cell it decreases to order 142, it is still\nhigher than in the case without the THz field with cutoffs at harmonic orders 136 and 121, respectively. Without the\nTHz field, by use of the same spectral filtering two almost identical pulses are obtained (concerning their duration\nand peak power) with half the IR optical cycle delay between them, and a third one having much lower peak power\nis also observable.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nMacroscopic effects for high-order harmonic generation in the presence of strong THz fields were studied. Our\nresults show that the cutoff order for harmonic radiation is increased from 90 to 135. Furthermore the available\nbandwidth for SAP generation is increased from 23 eV to 93 eV. We also show that even in cases when longer laser\npulses are used (8, 10 or 12 fs) and the single atom response yields multiple attosecond pulses, propagation effects\ncan eliminate the contribution from certain sets of trajectories, yielding a single attosecond pulse at the exit of the\ncell (with contrast ratio of 170:1, 40:1, and 15:1, respectively). The long-trajectory components are also cleaned from\nthe surviving pulse during propagation resulting in an effective decrease of pulse duration, making the technique\npromising for obtaining a reliable source of short, isolated attosecond pulses with good contrast and low divergence.\nBy carefully adjustment of the parameters, such as gas pressure and peak intensity of the laser pulse, 130 as pulses\nare produced using adequate spectral filtering in a straightforward manner, instead of the 225 as pulse obtained using\nonly the IR pulse. Due to the large bandwidth the transform limited duration of these pulses is reduced from 210 to\njust \u224850 as in the presence of the THz field.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe project was supported by the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme under contract ITN2008-238362 (ATTOFEL).
