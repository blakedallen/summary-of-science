The \u039eN \u2212 \u039b\u039b\ninteraction accounts for the existence of doubly strange hypernuclei, which is a gateway\nto strange hadronic matter. Strangeness \u22122 baryon-baryon interactions also account for a\npossible six-quark H-dibaryon, which has yet to be experimentally observed. Its knowledge\nis naturally invaluable for the quantitative predictions for various aspects of neutron star\nmatter.\nThere has been an steady progress towards the S = \u22122 baryon-baryon interaction. The\n\u039bN interaction is pretty much understood based on the experimental data of \u039b hypernuclei.\nThere is also some progress made on the \u03a3N interaction. However, the experimental knowledge on the \u039eN and hyperon-hyperon (Y Y ) interactions is quite poor. The only information available came from doubly strange hypernuclei, suggesting that the 1 S0 \u039b\u039b interaction\nshould be moderately attractive. An upper limit of B\u039b\u039b = 7.25 \u00b1 0.19 MeV has been deduced for an hypothetical H-dibaryon (a lower limit of 2223.7 MeV/c2 for its mass) from the\nso-called Nagara event [1] at a 90% confidence level. The KEK-E176/E373 hybrid emulsion\nexperiments observed other events corresponding to double\u2212\u039b hypernuclei. Among them,\nthe Demachi-Yanagi [2, 3], identified as 10\n\u039b\u039b Be drove a value of B\u039b\u039b = 11.90 \u00b1 0.13 [4]. A new\nobserved double-\u039b event has been recently reported by the KEK-E373 experiment, the Hida\nevent [3], although with uncertainties on its nature it has been interpreted as an observation\nof the ground state of the 11\n\u039b\u039b Be [4]. Very recently, doubly strange baryon-baryon scattering\ndata at low energies were deduced for the first time, obtaining some experimental data and\nupper limits for different elastic and inelastic cross sections: \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039e\u2212 p and \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b [5].\nRecent results of the KEK-PS E522 experiment indicates the possibility of a H-dibaryon as\na resonance state with a mass range between the \u039b\u039b and N\u039e thresholds [6].\nIn the planned experiments at J-PARC [7], dozens of emulsions events for double\u2212\u039b\nhypernuclei will be produced. The (K \u2212 , K + ) reaction is one of the most promising ways\nof studying doubly strange systems. \u039b\u039b hypernuclei can be produced through the reaction K \u2212 p \u2192 K + \u039e\u2212 followed by \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b. It is therefore compulsory having theoretical\npredictions concerning the \u039eN \u2212 \u039b\u039b coupling [8] to guide the experimental way and, in\na symbiotic manner, to use the new experimental data as a feedback of our theoretical\nknowledge. Such a process may shed light on our understanding of the nature of SU(3)\nsymmetry breaking in the baryon-baryon interaction. Knowledge of the strangeness \u22122 sector is therefore a challenge for understanding the baryon-baryon interaction in a unified way.\nThe chiral constituent quark model has been very successful in the simultaneous description\nof the baryon-baryon interaction and the baryon spectrum as well as in the study of the\ntwo- and three-baryon bound-state problem for the nonstrange sector [9]. A generalization\nto the strange sector has been applied to study the meson and baryon spectra [10], giving\na nice description of the hyperon-nucleon elastic and inelastic cross sections, and valuable\npredictions for the strangeness \u22121 three-baryon systems: \u039bNN \u2212 \u03a3NN [11].\nIn this work, we will apply the same model to derive the strangeness \u22122 baryon-baryon\ninteractions: \u039b\u039b, \u039b\u03a3, \u03a3\u03a3 and N\u039e. We will use these two-body interactions to calculate\ntwo-body elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections and we will compare to experimental\ndata and other theoretical models. We will also calculate the two-body scattering lengths of\n2\n\n\fthe different spin-isospin channels to compare with other theoretical models. The structure\nof the paper is the following. In the next section we will resume the basic aspects of the\ntwo-body interactions and we will present the integral equations for the different two-body\nsystems. In section III we present our results compared to other models and the available\nexperimental data. Finally, in section IV we summarize our main conclusions.\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\nA.\n\nThe strangeness \u22122 baryon-baryon potential\n\nThe baryon-baryon interactions involved in the study of the coupled \u039b\u039b \u2212 N\u039e \u2212 \u039b\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3\u03a3\nsystem are obtained from the chiral constituent quark model [9]. In this model baryons are\ndescribed as clusters of three interacting massive (constituent) quarks, the mass coming\nfrom the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The first ingredient of the quark-quark\ninteraction is a confining potential (CON). Perturbative aspects of QCD are taken into\naccount by means of a one-gluon potential (OGE). Spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry\ngives rise to boson exchanges between quarks. In particular, there appear pseudoscalar boson\nexchanges and their corresponding scalar partners [11]. Thus, the quark-quark interaction\nwill read:\nVqq (~rij ) = VCON (~rij ) + VOGE (~rij ) + V\u03c7 (~rij ) + VS (~rij ) ,\n(1)\nwhere the i and j indices are associated with i and j quarks respectively, and ~rij stands for\nthe interquark distance. V\u03c7 denotes the pseudoscalar meson-exchange interaction and VS\nstands for the scalar meson-exchange potential described in Ref. [11]. Explicit expressions\nof all the interacting potentials and a more detailed discussion of the model can be found\nin Refs. [10, 11]. In order to derive the local B1 B2 \u2192 B3 B4 potentials from the basic\nqq interaction defined above we use a Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Explicitly, the\npotential is calculated as follows,\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nVB1 B2 (L S T )\u2192B3 B4 (L\u2032 S \u2032 T ) (R) = \u03beLL SST T (R) \u2212 \u03beLL SST T (\u221e) ,\n\nwhere\nL\u2032 S \u2032\n\n\u03beL S T T (R) = rD\n\nD\n\nP\nL\u2032 S \u2032 T ~\n~\n\u03a8B\n(R) | 6i<j=1 Vqq (~rij ) | \u03a8LB1SBT2 (R)\n3 B4\n\nL\u2032 S \u2032 T ~\n\u03a8B\n(R)\n3 B4\n\n|\n\nL\u2032 S \u2032 T ~\n\u03a8B\n(R)\n3 B4\n\nErD\n\n~\n\u03a8LB1SBT2 (R)\n\n|\n\n(2)\n\nE\n\n~\n\u03a8LB1SBT2 (R)\n\nE\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nIn the last expression the quark coordinates are integrated out keeping R fixed, the resulting\n~\ninteraction being a function of the Bi \u2212 Bj relative distance. The wave function \u03a8LBiSBTj (R)\nfor the two-baryon system is discussed in detail in Ref. [9].\nB.\n\nIntegral equations for the two-body systems\n\nIf we consider the system of two baryons B1 and B2 with strangeness \u22122, N\u039e and\nY1 Y2 (Yi = \u03a3, \u039b), in a relative S\u2212state interacting through a potential V that contains a\ntensor force, then there is a coupling to the B1 B2 D\u2212wave so that the Lippmann-Schwinger\nequation for the spin singlet channels of Table I is of the form\n\n3\n\n\ft\u03b1\u2190\u03b2;ji (p, p\u2032\u2032 ; W ) = V\u03b1\u2190\u03b2;ji (p, p\u2032\u2032 )\n+\n\nXZ\n\u03b3\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\np\u2032 dp\u2032 V\u03b1\u2190\u03b3;ji (p, p\u2032 )\n\n0\n\nk\u03b32\n\n2\u03bc\u03b3\nt\u03b3\u2190\u03b2;ji (p\u2032 , p\u2032\u2032 ; W ),\n\u2212 p\u20322 + i\u01eb\n\n(4)\n\nwhere t is the two-body amplitude, j, i, and W are the total angular momentum, isospin\nand invariant energy of the system, and, for example, for i = 0 the subscripts \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3\ntake the values \u039b\u039b, N\u039e and \u03a3\u03a3, and similarly for the i = 1 and i = 2 channels shown in\nTable I.\nFor the spin triplet channels of Table I the Lippmann-Schwinger equation is of the form,\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\nll\n\u2032\u2032\ntll\n\u03b1\u2190\u03b2;ji (p, p ; W ) = V\u03b1\u2190\u03b2;ji (p, p )\n\n+\n\nX X Z\n\n\u221e\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nll\np\u2032 dp\u2032 V\u03b1\u2190\u03b3;ji\n(p, p\u2032 )\n\n\u03b3 l\u2032 =0,2 0\n\nk\u03b32\n\n2\u03bc\u03b3\n\u2032 l\u2032\u2032\ntl\u03b3\u2190\u03b2;ji\n(p\u2032 , p\u2032\u2032 ; W ),\n\u20322\n\u2212 p + i\u01eb\n\n(5)\n\nwith \u03bc\u03b3 the reduced mass of the system and the on-shell momenta k\u03b3 are defined as\nW =\n\nq\n\nm21\u03b3 + k\u03b32 +\n\nq\n\nm22\u03b3 + k\u03b32 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere m1 and m2 are the masses of the particles of channel \u03b3.\nC.\n\nScattering cross sections\n\nWe now turn to the available low-energy data on the N\u039e scattering.

The scattering lengths of the\ndifferent spin-isospin channels are given in Table II compared to other theoretical models\nwhen available.\nWe show in Fig. 1 the \u039e\u2212 p elastic cross section compared to the in-medium experimental\n\u2212\n\u039e p cross section around p\u039elab = 550 MeV/c, where \u03c3\u039e\u2212 p = 30 \u00b1 6.7 +3.7\n\u22123.6 mb [12]. Another\n+2.5\nanalysis using the eikonal approximation gives \u03c3\u039e\u2212 p = 20.9 \u00b1 4.5 \u22122.4 mb [13]. A more\nrecent experimental analysis [5] for the low energy \u039e\u2212 p elastic and \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b total cross\nsections in the range 0.2 GeV/c to 0.8 GeV/c shows that the former is less than 24 mb at 90%\nconfidence level and the latter of the order of several mb, respectively. In Fig. 2 we present the\ninelastic \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b cross section. It has been recently estimated at a laboratory momentum\nof p\u039elab =500 MeV/c, see Ref. [5], assuming a quasifree scattering process for the reaction\n12\nC(\u039e\u2212 , \u039b\u039b)X obtaining a total cross section \u03c3(\u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b) = 4.3+6.3\n\u22122.7 mb. The upper limit\nof the cross section was derived as 12 mb at 90% confidence level. Fig. 3 shows the total\ninelastic cross section \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039e0 n. Combining the results of Refs. [5] and [14], one obtains\n\u03c3(\u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039e0 n) \u223c 10 mb. A recent measurement of a quasifree p(K \u2212 , K + )\u039e\u2212 reaction in\nemulsion plates yielded 12.7+3.5\n\u22123.1 mb for the total inelastic cross section in the momentum\nrange 0.4 \u2212 0.6 GeV/c [15], consistent with the results of Ref. [14]. The experimental results\nfor \u039e\u2212 p inelastic scattering of Refs. [14, 15] involve both \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b and \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039e0 n [5],\nwhat combined with the value for \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b of Ref. [5] allows to obtain an estimate of the\ninelastic cross section \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039e0 n. Finally in Fig. 4 we present our prediction for the \u039b\u039b\nscattering cross section. In this last case there are no experimental data.\nAs can be seen our results agree with the experimental data for the elastic and inelastic\n\u039eN cross sections. The small bumps in the cross sections correspond to the opening of\ninelastic channels. As explained above, the interacting model is taken for grant from Ref. [11],\nwhere three body systems with strangeness \u22121 were studied, involving therefore two-body\nsubsystems with strangeness 0 and \u22121. The agreement with the experimental data gives\nsupport to the dynamical model used and make our predictions valuable for forthcoming\nexperiments. We would like to emphasize the agreement of our results with the \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b\nconversion cross section. This reaction is of particular importance in assessing the stability of\n\u039e\u2212 quasi-particle states in nuclei. Our results are close to the estimations of the NijmegenD model [20]. Ref. [16] predicts \u03c3(\u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039e0 n) \u223c 15 mb at p\u039elab =0.5 GeV/c. Ref. [14]\nreported 14 mb for the inelastic scattering involving both \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b and \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039e0 n. We\nfound a smaller value of approximately 6 mb for both inelastic channels, in close agreement\nto experiment. In the case of the elastic \u039b\u039b cross section there are no experimental data.\nOur predictions are rather similar to Refs. [16, 17]. We definitely need more experimental\ndata with high statistics. This will help us in discriminating among the different dynamical\nmodels. A theoretical evaluation of the in-medium cross sections would also be necessary.\nThe scattering lengths for the different spin-isospin channels are given in Table II. These\nparameters are complex for the N\u039e (i, j) = (0, 0) since the inelastic \u039b\u039b channel is open,\nfor the \u039b\u03a3 isospin 1 channel due to the opening of the N\u039e channel, and for the \u03a3\u03a3 i =0\nand 1 since the \u039b\u039b and N\u039e channels are open in the first case, and the N\u039e and \u039b\u03a3 are\nopen in the second (see Table I). There is no direct comparison between our results and\nthose of Ref. [16]. Although both are quark-model based results, Ref. [16] used an oldfashioned quark-model interacting potential. For example, they use a huge strong coupling\n5\n\n\fconstant, \u03b1S = 1.9759, and they consider the contribution of vector mesons what could give\nrise to double counting problems [21]. As explicitly written in Ref. [16], the parameters\nare effective in their approach and has very little to do with QCD. As mentioned above,\nsince the observation of the Nagara event [1] it is generally accepted that the \u039b\u039b interaction\nis only moderately attractive. Our result for the 1 S0 \u039b\u039b scattering length is compatible\n2\n) drives a value of 5.41\nwith such event. A rough estimate of B\u039b\u039b (B\u039b\u039b \u2248 (h\u0304c)2 /2\u03bc\u039b\u039b a\u039b\u039b\n1S\n0\nMeV, below the upper limit extracted from the Nagara event, B\u039b\u039b = 7.25 \u00b1 0.19 MeV.\nMoreover, although from the \u039b\u039b scattering length alone one cannot draw any conclusion\non the magnitude of the two-\u039b separation energy, recent estimates [22] have reproduced\nthe two-\u039b separation energy, defined as \u2206B\u039b\u039b = B\u039b\u039b (6\u039b\u039b He) \u2212 2B\u039b (5\u039b He), with scattering\nlengths of \u22121.32 fm. The only reliable way to determine the two-\u039b separation energy in our\nmodel would be a concrete calculation of doubly-strange hypernuclei. This has not been\ndone so far, and it is not clear that such calculation might help to further constrain the\npotential model.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\n\nIn this letter we have presented the first results for the doubly strange N\u039e and Y1 Y2\ninteractions (Yi = \u03a3, \u039b) obtained with a constituent quark model approach designed to\nstudy the non-strange hadron phenomenology. The interaction incorporates long-ranged\nmeson-exchange contributions and the short-range dynamics generated by the one-gluon\nexchange and quark antisymmetry contributions.\nWe showed that the CCQM predictions are consistent with the recently obtained doubly\nstrange elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections. In particular, our results are compatible with the \u039e\u2212 p \u2192 \u039b\u039b conversion cross section, important in assessing the stability\nof \u039e\u2212 quasi-particle states in nuclei. Furthermore a moderately attractive \u039b\u039b interaction\narises. The presently available scattering data are, however, not sufficient to draw definitive\nconclusions about the model, but forthcoming experimental data of the observables reported\nwill help in testing different theoretical model predictions.\nIt is expected that in the coming years better-quality data on the fundamental N\u039e and\nY Y interactions as well as much information about the physics of hypernuclei will become\navailable at the new facilities J-PARC (Tokai, Japan) and FAIR (Darmstadt, Germany).\nThe CCQM developed here can then be used to analyze these upcoming data in a modelindependent way.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors greatly acknowledge C.
