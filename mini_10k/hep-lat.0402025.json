INTRODUCTION\n\nCalculation of scattering phase shift is an important step for expanding our understanding of the strong interaction based on lattice QCD beyond the hadron mass spectrum. For\nscattering lengths, which are the threshold values of phase shifts, several studies have already\nbeen carried out. For the simplest case of the two-pion system, I = 2 S-wave scattering\nlength has been calculated in detail [1\u20138] including the continuum extrapolation [6,7]. There\nis also a pioneering attempt at I = 0 scattering length [3], which is much more difficult due\nto the presence of contributions from disconnected diagrams.\nThe first pioneering study of I = 2 S-wave scattering phase shift was made by Fiebig\net al. [9]. They estimated the phase shift from the two-pion effective potential calculated\nin the lattice simulations. A direct calculation of phase shift on the lattice without recourse to effective potentials is possible if one uses the finite volume method proposed by\nL\u00fcscher [10,11]. In this method phase shift is obtained from the two-pion energy eigenvalues for finite volume. However, it is non-trivial to extract the energy eigenvalues from the\ntime behavior of the two-pion correlation functions, because the correlation functions have\nmulti-exponential time behaviors due to presence of multiple states with the same quantum\nnumbers. Recently we presented a direct calculation of the phase shift [8] in quenched QCD.\nIn this calculation the diagonalization method proposed by L\u00fcscher and Wolff [12] was used\nto solve the problem of the multi-exponential behavior. Very recently Kim reported on his\npreliminary results on G- and H-period boundary lattices, where the problem can be avoided\nby the boundary condition [13].\nIn all previous studies of the scattering phase shift calculations were carried out with\nquenched approximation nor the continuum limit was taken. It is predicted in chiral perturbation theory that unphysical chiral divergences appear in the scattering length in the\nquenched theory due to the lack of unitarity [14,15]. The unphysical divergences can also\noccur in the phase shift. While the presence of such pathologies has not been numerically\nconfirmed in actual lattice calculations with quenched approximation, we should make our\nstudy in full QCD in order to avoid such uncontrollable quenching problems.\nIn this paper we present a calculation of the physical scattering phase shift for I = 2\nS-wave two-pion system including the dynamical quark effects and taking the continuum\nlimit. We use the full QCD configurations previously generated for a study of light hadron\nspectrum [16] with a renormalization group improved gauge action and clover fermion action\nwith a tadpole improved clover coefficient. The phase shift is evaluated by the finite volume\nmethod as in the previous work [8]. In order to obtain the phase shift at several energies\nfrom one full QCD configuration, the calculations are carried out for two types of momentum\nsystems. One of them is the center of mass system, where the total momentum of the twopion system is zero. In the other system where the total momentum is fixed to a non-zero\nvalue, we use the method proposed by Rummukainen and Gottlieb [17] which is a simple\nextension of that by L\u00fcscher in the center of mass system to general momentum systems.\nWe shall refer to this system as laboratory system in this paper.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we describe the finite volume method\nfor both momentum systems for evaluating the phase shift from the two-pion energy. We\nalso explain the diagonalization method to extract the two-pion energy eigenvalues. The\nparameters of the calculation in this work are given in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we show data\n2\n\n\ffor the pion four-point functions and the effect of diagonalizations for the two momentum\nsystems. We then present the results of the scattering length and the phase shift at each \u03b2\nand in the continuum limit. In Sec. V we briefly summarize this work.\nII. METHODS\nA. Finite volume method\n1. Center of mass system\n\nIn the center of mass system the total momentum of the two-pion system is zero. The\nenergy eigenvalue of two pions in a finite periodic box L3 without two-pion interactions is\ngiven by\nq\n\np2n = (2\u03c0/L)2 n, n \u2208 Z,\n\nq\n\np2n = (2\u03c0/L)2 n, n \u2208\n/ Z.\n\nEn = 2 m2\u03c0 + p2n ,\n\n(1)\n\nIn the interacting case the total momentum is also zero and the energy eigenvalue of the\nn-th state is given by\nE n = 2 m2\u03c0 + p2n ,\n\n(2)\n\nThe energy eigenvalue is written as that of the free two-pion case with momentum pn and\n\u2212pn , but the quantity n = (L/2\u03c0)2 * p2n is no longer an integer. L\u00fcscher [10,11] found that\nthe momentum pn satisfies the relation\n\u221a\n\u03c0 3/2 n\ntan \u03b4(pn ) =\n,\n(3)\nZ00 (1; n)\nwhere \u03b4(pn ) is the S-wave scattering phase shift in the infinite volume and\n1 X 2\nZ00 (s; n) = \u221a\n(n \u2212 n)\u2212s .\n4\u03c0 n\u2208Z 3\n\n(4)\n\nThe calculation method of Z00 (s; n) is discussed in Appendix A. Using Eq.(3), we can obtain\nthe phase shift from the energy eigenvalue calculated in the lattice simulations.\n2. Laboratory system\n\nLet us consider a two-pion system with a non-zero total momentum P 6= 0 in a periodic\nbox L3 . We shall refer to this system as the laboratory system in the following. In the\nlaboratory system the energy eigenvalue for the n-th energy state EnP without interaction is\ngiven by\nEnP =\n\nq\n\n2\nm2\u03c0 + (pP\n1,n ) +\n\nq\n\n3\nP\n3\nL/(2\u03c0)pP\n1,n \u2208 Z , L/(2\u03c0)p2,n \u2208 Z ,\n\n2\nm2\u03c0 + (pP\n2,n ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere pP\ni,n is the i-th pion momentum of the n-th energy state in the laboratory system,\nwhich takes discrete values due to the periodic boundary condition in finite volume. The\n3\n\n\fP\n\ntwo-pion interaction shifts EnP to E n as in the center of mass system. By the Lorentz\ntransformation with a boost factor\nP\n\nq\n\nP\n\n\u03b3 = E n / (E n )2 \u2212 P2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nthe energy in the center of mass system can be obtained as\nP\n\nE n = E n /\u03b3.\n\n(7)\n\nIt is noted that the total momentum P is not shifted by the two-pion interaction.\nThe center of mass momentum pn is determined from E n by\nq\n\nE n = 2 m2\u03c0 + p2n ,\n\np2n = (2\u03c0/L)2 m, m \u2208\n/ Z,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere m is also not an integer. Rummukainen and Gottlieb [17] found that the momentum\npn is related to the phase shift in the infinite volume through the relation\n\u221a\n\u03b3\u03c0 3/2 m\ntan \u03b4(pn ) = d\n,\n(9)\nZ00 (1; m)\nwhere\n1 X 2\nd\nZ00\n(s; m) = \u221a\n(r \u2212 m)\u2212s .\n4\u03c0 r\u2208P d\n\n(10)\n\nThe summation for r is carried out over the set\nP d = {r| r = \u03b3\u0302 \u22121 (n + d/2), n \u2208 Z 3 }\n\n(11)\n\nwhere d = L/(2\u03c0)P. The operation \u03b3\u0302 \u22121 is the inverse Lorentz transformation : \u03b3\u0302 \u22121 n =\n1/\u03b3 * n|| + n\u22a5 , where n|| = (n * d)d/d2 is the parallel component and n\u22a5 = n \u2212 n|| the\nd\nperpendicular component of n in the direction d. The calculation method of Z00\n(s; m) is\ndiscussed in Appendix A. Substituting d = 0 and \u03b3 = 1 into Eq.(9), we obtain the formula\nfor the center of mass system Eq.(3).\nB. Extraction of energy eigenvalues of the two-pion system\n\nIn order to extract the two-pion energy eigenvalues in the system with a total momentum\nP, we construct the pion four-point function by\n(NR )\n(NR )\nGnm\n(t) = h0|\u03a9n (t)\u03a9m\n(tS )|0i,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we omit the index for the total momentum. The operator \u03a9n (t) is a two-pion operator\nat time t for the n-th energy eigenstate which is defined by\n\u03a9n (t) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c0(p1 , t)\u03c0(p2 , t) / [\n\np1 ,p2 \u2208Sn\n\nX\n\np1 ,p2 \u2208Sn\n\n4\n\n1],\n\n(13)\n\n\fwhere \u03c0(p, t) is the pion operator at time t with momentum p. The p1 and p2 are the\nmomenta on the lattice and take discrete values, i.e., L/(2\u03c0)p1 \u2208 Z 3 , L/(2\u03c0)p2 \u2208 Z 3 . The\nsummation for these momenta is taken over the set\nSn = {p1 , p2 |\n\nq\n\nm2\u03c0 + p21 +\n\nq\n\nm2\u03c0 + p22 = EnP , p1 + p2 = P},\n\n(14)\n\nwhere EnP is fixed at the energy of the n-th energy state with the total momentum P in the\nfree two-pion case. This summation of momenta projects out the A+ representation of the\nrotation group on the lattice, which equals the S-wave states in the continuum, ignoring the\nstates with higher angular momentum. For example, states with angular momentum l \u2265 4\nare ignored for L/(2\u03c0)P = (0, 0, 0), and l \u2265 2 for L/(2\u03c0)P = (1, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 0).\nFor the source we use a different operator \u03a9n(NR ) (t) defined by\n\u03a9n(NR ) (t)\n\nNR\n1 X\n\u03c0(p1,n , t, \u03bej )\u03c0(p2,n , t, \u03b7j ),\n=\nNR j=1\n\n(15)\n\nwhere\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0014X\n\u0015\n1 X\nip*x \u2020\nq(x, t)e \u03bej (x) \u03b35\nq(y, t)\u03bej (y) .\n\u03c0(p, t, \u03bej ) = 3\nL x\ny\n\n(16)\n\nHere p1,n , p2,n are fixed to one of the values in the set Sn for the sink operator \u03a9n (t) defined\nin Eq.(13). The functions \u03bej (x) and \u03b7j (x) are complex random numbers in three-dimensional\nspace, whose property is\nNR\n1 X\nlim\n\u03bej\u2020 (x)\u03bej (y) = L3 \u03b4x,y .\nNR \u2192\u221e NR\nj=1\n\n(17)\n\nThe pion propagator is also calculated with the random number as\nR)\nG\u03c0(N\n(t) =\nn\n\nNR\n1 X\nh0|\u03c0(pn , t)\u03c0(\u2212pn , tS , \u03bej )|0i.\nNR j=1\n\n(18)\n\nWhen the number of random noise sources NR is taken large or the number of gauge\nconfigurations are large, we expect\n(NR )\nGnm\n(t) \u223c Gnm (t) = h0|\u03a9n (t)\u03a9m (tS )|0i\nR)\nG\u03c0(N\n(t) \u223c G\u03c0n (t) = h0|\u03c0(pn , t)\u03c0(\u2212pn , tS )|0i\nn\n\n(19)\n\nand the four-point function will be symmetric under the exchange of the sink and the source\nindices n and m. We fix NR = 2 in all calculations. The number of the gauge configurations\nis from 380 to 725 depending on the lattice spacing as shown in Sec. III.\nThe four-point function can be written in terms of the energy eigenstates |\u03a9n i with the\ntotal momentum P as follows:\nGnm (t) =\n\nX\nj\n\nP\n\nVnjT Vjm e\u2212E j (t\u2212tS ) , Vjm = h\u03a9j |\u03a9m (0)|0i,\n5\n\n(20)\n\n\fP\n\nwhere E n is the energy eigenvalues with the two-pion interaction. Since the matrix Vjm is\nnot diagonal generally, the four-point function contains many exponential terms and is not\ndiagonal with respect to n and m.\nA simple method for extracting the energy eigenvalues is diagonalization of G(t) at each\nP\nt. L\u00fcscher and Wolff [12] found that the eigenvalue is given by \u03bbn (t) = exp(\u2212E n t) \u00d7 {1 +\nP\nP\nP\nO(exp[\u2212\u2206n t])} with \u2206n = minn6=m |E n \u2212 E m |. In order to extract E n from the eigenvalue\nby a single exponential fit, we have to analyze G(t) in the large t region where O(exp[\u2212\u2206n t])\nterms can be neglected. However, it may be very difficult to employ the fitting with this\nmethod due to loss of statistics of G(t) in the large t region.\nL\u00fcscher and Wolff also proposed another method [12], which is a diagonalization of the\nmatrix M(t, t0 ) constructed from G(t) by\nM(t, t0 ) = G(t0 )\u22121/2 G(t)G(t0 )\u22121/2 ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere t0 is a reference time. The eigenvalues of M(t, t0 ) equals\nP\n\n\u03bbn (t, t0 ) = e\u2212E n (t\u2212t0 ) .\n\n(22)\n\nwithout O(exp[\u2212\u2206n t]) terms. Therefore after the diagonalization of M(t, t0 ) we can extract\nthe two-pion energy eigenvalue by a single exponential fitting of \u03bbn (t, t0 ). In this work we\nadopt the second method.\nIn the diagonalization method we assume that the two-pion states dominate and effects\nfrom other states can be neglected in G(t) for the considered range of t. For example,\nour analysis loses its validity when the center of mass two-pion energy is over the inelastic\nscattering limit, e.g., E \u2265 4m\u03c0 . In this case G(t) is dominated by the four-pion ground\nstate rather than the two-pion state in the large t region. Further we should pay attention\nto the states contained with the excited pion state, such as \u03c0\u03c0 \u2217 (1300). The existence of such\nundesirable states is discussed in Sec. III.\nSince we cannot calculate all components of G(t) in the actual lattice calculations, a\ncut-off of the state N has to be introduced. We expect that the components of Gnm (t)\nwith n, m \u2264 k dominate for the k-th eigenvalue \u03bbk (t) in the large t and t0 region, while\nthe components n, m > k are less important. We set t and t0 large and investigate the\ndependence for the cut-off N \u2265 k.\nIII. PARAMETERS\n\nWe calculate the scattering phase shift on the gauge configurations previously generated\nincluding two flavors of dynamical quark effects for the study of the light hadron spectrum [16]. This work employed a renormalization group improved gauge action and clover\nfermion action with a tadpole improved clover coefficient cSW , which we also use in the\npresent study. The gauge action is constructed in terms of the 1 \u00d7 1 and 1 \u00d7 2 Wilson loops\nW 1\u00d71 and W 1\u00d72 ,\nSG =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03b2\uf8ed\n1\u00d71\n1\u00d72\nW\u03bc\u03bd\n(x) + c1\nW\u03bc\u03bd\n(x)\uf8f8 .\nc0\n6\nx,\u03bc,\u03bd\nx,\u03bc<\u03bd\nX\n\nX\n\n6\n\n(23)\n\n\fThe coefficient c1 is fixed to c1 = \u22120.331 by an approximate renormalization group analysis\nand c0 = 1 \u2212 8c1 = 3.648 by the normalization condition [24] . The bare gauge coupling \u03b2 is\ndefined by \u03b2 = 6/g 2. For clover fermion action [25] a mean-field improved clover coefficient\ncSW = (W 1\u00d71 )\u22123/4 is adopted, where the plaquette W 1\u00d71 = 1 \u2212 0.8412/\u03b2 is determined by\none-loop perturbation theory [24].\nThe parameters for the configuration generation are summarized in Table I. The configurations were generated at \u03b2 = 1.80 and 1.95 and 2.10, and for four hopping parameters\n\u03ba corresponding to m\u03c0 /m\u03c1 \u2248 0.6 \u2212 0.8 in each \u03b2. The lattice spacing is estimated from\nthe \u03c1 meson mass and equals a = 0.2150(22), 0.1555(17) and 0.1076(13) fm, respectively.\nThe lattice size L3 \u00d7 T at each \u03b2 is 123 \u00d7 24, 163 \u00d7 32 and 243 \u00d7 48, which correspond to\na 2.53 fm3 lattice. The periodic boundary conditions are imposed both in the spatial and\ntime directions.\nThe quark propagators are calculated with the periodic boundary condition in the spatial\ndirections, and the Dirichlet boundary condition in the temporal direction. The source\noperator \u03a9n(NR ) (tS ) is set at tS = 4 for \u03b2 = 1.80 and \u03b2 = 1.95, and tS = 6 for \u03b2 = 2.10 to\nreduce effects from the temporal boundary. In order to avoid effects from excited states the\nreference time for the diagonalization introduced in Eq.(21) is fixed to large value; t0 = 10,\n12 and 16 at \u03b2 = 1.80, 1.95 and 2.10, respectively. At \u03b2 = 1.80 for the lightest quark mass\nwe carry out extra measurements to reduce statistical errors in which the source operator\nis located at tS + T /2 and the Dirichlet boundary condition in the temporal direction is\nimposed at T /2. We average over the two measurements for the analysis of the pion fourpoint functions and the pion propagator.\nIn order to extract the phase shift at various momenta from a single full QCD configuration, the calculations are carried out in three momentum systems, the center of mass (CM)\nand two laboratory systems (L1 and L2), whose total momenta are\nCM\nL1\nL2\n\nCenter of mass system\nLaboratory system\nLaboratory system\n\nL/(2\u03c0)P\n(0, 0, 0)\n(1, 0, 0)\n(1, 1, 0) .\n\n(24)\n\nIn Table II we show the momenta chosen for the source operator \u03a9n(NR ) defined in Eq.(15).\nAll elements in Sn , which appear in the summation over momenta in the sink operator\n\u03a9n defined in Eq.(13), can be obtained from the source momenta by cubic, tetragonal and\northorhombic rotations on the lattice for the CM, L1 and L2 systems, respectively.\nThe center of mass energies of the free two-pion system En in this work are plotted in\nFig. 1, where the smallest pion mass at \u03b2 = 2.10 is assumed. In all systems the phase\nshift is evaluated at the ground (n = 0) and first excited states (n = 1), which are denoted\nby closed symbols. Other higher energy states (n \u2265 2) plotted by open symbols are used\nto investigate the effects of the cut-off N introduced in the diagonalization. In the two\nlaboratory systems, L1 and L2, we also calculate the n = 3 state, because the energies of\nthese states are very close to the n = 2 state as shown in the figure and effects from these\nstates can be comparable. We also plot the location of the inelastic scattering threshold,\nE \u2265 4m\u03c0 , and the energy of state \u03c0\u03c0 \u2217 (1300), which can appear in the pion four-point\nfunction and causes loss of validity of the diagonalization method as discussed in Sec. II B.\nWe neglect the quark mass dependence of \u03c0 \u2217 (1300) in the estimation. As shown in Fig. 1 the\n7\n\n\fenergies of these undesirable states are very far from the measured point of the scattering\nphase shift.\nWe estimate the errors of the four-point functions and the pion propagator by the jackknife method. In our study of the light hadron spectrum [16], we have shown that the\nseparation of 50 trajectories covers all the autocorrelations of the configuration, so that in\nthe present analysis we also use bins of 50 trajectories in the jackknife method. In the\nactual analysis a bin size of 5 or 10 (\u03b2 = 2.10 at the lightest quark mass) measurements are\nemployed, because we skip 10 or 5 trajectories between successive measurements.\nIV. RESULTS\nA. Effect of diagonalization\n\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the absolute value of the pion four-point function Gnm (t) defined\nby Eq.(12) at several values of n and m for the three momentum systems. This figure\ncorresponds to m\u03c0 /m\u03c1 \u2248 0.6 at \u03b2 = 2.10. Filled and open symbols indicate positive and\nnegative values. In all systems the off-diagonal components of Gnm (t) (n 6= m) are not\nnegligible compared with the diagonal components (n = m). We also observe that the\nshape of Gnm (t) in the CM and L1 systems are very similar. In the L2 system G00 (t) is\nalmost the same as G11 (t) for all t. This is attributed to the fact that these energies are\nvery close in the free two-pion case. The figure also shows that Gnm (t) is symmetric under\nthe exchange of the indices as expected. In the following analysis we assume the symmetry\nof Gnm (t) and we average values of the symmetric components.\nIn order to investigate the effect of diagonalization we define two ratios Rn (t) and Dn (t)\nas follows,\nRn (t) =\nDn (t) =\n\nGnn (t)\n,\n\u03c0\nG1,n (t)G\u03c02,n (t)\nG\u03c01,n (t0 )G\u03c02,n (t0 )\n\u03bbn (t, t0 ) \u03c0\n,\nG1,n (t)G\u03c02,n (t)\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nwhere G\u03c0i,n (t) is the i-th pion propagator for the n-th energy state, and \u03bbn (t, t0 ) is the n-th\neigenvalue of the matrix M(t, t0 ) defined by Eq.(21) calculated with a finite cut-off of the\nenergy state N. If the pion four-point function contains only a single exponential term, i.e.,\nP\nGnm (t) \u221d \u03b4nm * exp[\u2212E n (t \u2212 tS )], then the ratio Rn (t) behaves as\nP\n\nRn (t) = A * exp(\u2212\u2206E n (t \u2212 tS )),\nP\n\n(27)\n\nP\n\nwhere \u2206E n = E n \u2212 EnP and A is a constant. If the cut-off of the state N for the diagonalization is sufficiently large, then the ratio Dn (t) behaves as\nP\n\nDn (t) = exp(\u2212\u2206E n (t \u2212 t0 )).\nP\n\n(28)\n\nIn these cases we can extract the n-th energy shift \u2206E n from the ratios Rn (t) or Dn (t) by\na single exponential fitting.\n8\n\n\fFirst we focus on the results in the CM system. For the ground state (n = 0) the ratios\nR0 (t) and D0 (t) for all m\u03c0 /m\u03c1 and \u03b2 are presented in Fig. 3. We divide the ratio D0 (t)\nby D0 (tS ) for comparison with R0 (t). The cut-off of the state N for the diagonalization is\nset at N = 2. We also check the cut-off dependence by taking N = 1 and confirm that it\nis negligible. From the figures we find that the diagonalization does not affect the result\nof the ground state and the energy shift can be extracted from the ratio R0 (t) without the\ndiagonalization.\nWe compare the ratios for the first excited state (n = 1) in the CM system in Fig. 4,\nwhere the cut-off is set at N = 1 and 2. Here we divide D1 (t) by D1 (tS ) as for n = 0. In\ncontrast to the case of the ground state the diagonalization is very effective for the smaller\nquark masses. The ratio R1 (t) for smaller masses rapidly increases, while such behavior\ncannot be seen in D1 (t). The cut-off dependence of D1 (t) is negligible for whole parameter\nregions as shown in the figure. Hence we can extract the energy shift from the ratio D1 (t)\nby a single exponential fitting.\nThe ratios in the L1 system are plotted in Fig. 5 for the ground state (n = 0); we also\ndivide Dn (t) by Dn (tS ) as for the CM system. We find that R0 (t) agrees with D0 (t) with\nN = 3. We also check the cut-off dependence by taking N = 1, 2 and confirm that it is\nnegligible. This indicates that the energy shift can be extracted without the diagonalization\nas for the ground state in the CM system. For the first excited state (n = 1), however, the\ndiagonalization is effective as shown in Fig. 6. We also find that the effect of the cut-off for\nD1 (t) is negligible by comparing the results with N = 1, 2 and 3. The ratio D1 (t) at \u03b2 = 1.95\nand 2.10 for m\u03c0 /m\u03c1 \u2248 0.6 do not show good exponential behaviors. We consider that this\nis due to insufficient statistics and do not include these data in the following analysis.\nFinally we focus on the L2 system. The behavior of the ratios in this system is essentially\ndifferent from those in the other systems. The ratios Rn (t) and Dn (t) are shown in Fig. 7\nfor the ground (n = 0) and in Fig. 8 for the first excited states (n = 1). In these figures\nDn (t) is divided by Dn (tS ). Since the energies of n = 0 and 1 states are very close in the\nfree two-pion case, not only the ratio for n = 1 but also that for n = 0 are affected by the\ndiagonalization. We also observe that the cut-off dependence is negligible by comparing the\nresults with N = 1, 2 and 3. The ratios Dn (t) for n = 0, 1 for m\u03c0 /m\u03c1 \u2248 0.6 at \u03b2 = 1.95 are\nnot clearly exponential in behavior. These results are not included in the following analysis\nconsidering that these defects are probably caused by insufficient statistics.\nIn order to show the effect of diagonalization in the L2 system clearly, we gather both\nratios Rn (t) and Dn (t) for n = 0 and 1 in Fig. 9. The data at \u03b2 = 2.10 for m\u03c0 /m\u03c1 \u2248 0.6 is\nshown in the figure. Before the diagonalization the two ratios Rn (t) have almost the same\nshape. After the diagonalization, however, the slope of the ratios Dn (t) for n = 0 decreases\nand that for n = 1 increases. This behavior can be understood by considering a simple\neigenvalue problem for two degenerate states. We assume that the energies for n = 0 and 1\nstates in the L2 system have the same energy E in the free two-pion case. Further we neglect\nthe effects from higher energy states. This assumption is supported by the independence on\nthe cut-off N. In the interacting case the Hamiltonian H for this system can be written as\nH=\n\nE+\u2206\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\nE+\u2206\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere the components of the Hamiltonian are defined by Hnm \u2261 h\u03a9n |H|\u03a9m i with the noninteracting two-pion state |\u03a9n i. The \u2206 and \u03b2 are unknown constants induced by the two9\n\n\fpion interaction. The constant \u2206 corresponds to the slopes of Rn (t) up to O((\u03b2t)2 ). The\neigenvalues E of H are given by\nE = E + \u2206 \u00b1 \u03b2.\n\n(30)\n\nThe values of \u2206 \u00b1 \u03b2 correspond to the slopes of Dn (t) for n = 0 and 1 in the figure. Here\nwe can see that the existence of the off-diagonal component of the Hamiltonian \u03b2 causes a\nseparation of Dn (t).\nUp to now we have shown that the ratios Dn (t) for any n in all the momentum systems\nP\nbehave as single exponential functions in t and it is possible to extract the energy shift \u2206E n\nby a single exponential fitting of the ratios. Our choice of the fitting range and the results\nP\nof \u2206E n are summarized in Appendix B. The procedure of calculating the scattering phase\nP\nshift \u03b4(pn ) from \u2206E n is the following. First we construct the two-pion energy eigenvalue\nP\nP\nP\nE n by E n = EnP + \u2206E n , where EnP is the two-pion energy in the free two-pion case. Then\nwe evaluate the Lorentz boost factor \u03b3, the center of mass energy E n and momentum p2n\nP\nfrom E n by Eqs.(6), (7) and (8). Finally we obtain the phase shift \u03b4(pn ) by substituting\np2n into the finite volume formulae given by Eqs.(3) and (9). The results are tabulated in\nAppendix B. In the appendix we also quote the 'scattering amplitude' defined by\nA(m\u03c0 , p) =\n\ntan \u03b4(p) E\n* ,\np\n2\n\n(31)\n\nwhere the amplitude is normalized as\nlim A(m\u03c0 , p) = a0 m\u03c0 ,\n\n(32)\n\np\u21920\n\nwith the scattering length a0 .\nB. Result for scattering length\n\nIn the CM system the momentum p2 for the ground state (n = 0) is very small as\nshown in Appendix B. Thus the scattering length a0 can be evaluated from the scattering\namplitude defined in Eq.(31) by A(m\u03c0 , p) \u2248 a0 m\u03c0 . In Fig. 10 we plot a0 /m\u03c0 as a function\nof m2\u03c0 at each \u03b2, which are also tabulated in Appendix B denoted by A(m\u03c0 , p)/m2\u03c0 . A\nsignificant curvature in the m2\u03c0 dependence at large \u03b2 is seen. This has not been clearly\nobserved in the previous studies of the scattering length. The existence of a large curvature\nrenders the chiral extrapolation of a0 /m\u03c0 very difficult. In this work we attempt to fit the\ndata with various fitting assumptions to obtain the scattering length at the physical pion\nmass m\u03c0 = 0.14 GeV.\nThe prediction of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) for the m2\u03c0 dependence has been\nworked out by Gasser and Leutwyler [26]. In one loop order it is given by\n1\nm2\u03c0\nm2\u03c0\na0\n=\u2212\n1\n\u2212\nL(\u03bc)\n\u2212\nC\n*\nlog\nL\nm\u03c0\n16\u03c0F 2\n16\u03c0 2 F 2\n\u03bc2\n(\n\n\"\n\n#)\n\n,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere F is the pseudoscalar decay constant in the chiral limit, L(\u03bc) is a low energy constant\nat a scale \u03bc, and CL = 7/2. It is clear that this one-loop formula cannot be naively applied\n10\n\n\fto our results of the scattering length. As shown in Fig. 10 the dependence of a0 /m\u03c0 on the\nlattice spacing is comparable to that of m2\u03c0 . This implies that we should extrapolate our\ndata with the formula including the O(a) effect. Such a formula for the pseudo scalar mass\nand the decay constant have been obtained in one-loop order of chiral perturbation theory\nfor the Wilson type fermions [29], but that for the scattering length is not yet available.\nFurther, even if the O(a) effect is negligible, it is not clear whether the formula of ChPT is\napplicable for our data calculated in a heavy pion mass region, m\u03c0 = 0.5 \u2212 1.1 GeV. Here,\nas a trial, we fit our data with the fitting assumption given by Eq.(33) with three unknown\nparameters F , L(\u03bc) and CL , and consider the dependence of fitted parameter values on\nthe lattice spacing. The results are summarized in Table III, where the scale \u03bc is fixed at\n\u03bc = 1 GeV in the analysis. We find a significant difference between CL obtained by the\nfitting and that of the prediction from ChPT (CL = 7/2) at all \u03b2.\nIt is expected that the chiral breaking effect of the Wilson type fermion causes a divergence in the chiral limit as a0 /m\u03c0 \u221d 1/m2\u03c0 [27]. The large curvature of the scattering length\nmay originate from this effect. In Table IV we tabulate the results of the fitting with\nA00\na0\n= 2 + A10 + A20 m2\u03c0 .\nm\u03c0\nm\u03c0\n\n(34)\n\nThe coefficient of the divergent term A00 , which comes from the chiral breaking effect, is\nexpected to vanish in the continuum limit. However, our results for A00 increases toward the\ncontinuum limit as opposed to the expectation. We consider that the effect of chiral breaking\nis not separated from the regular mass dependence. It is a very important future work to\ndetect the divergence term through simulations with much higher statistics and closer to the\nchiral limit. We assume that the effect of chiral breaking is small in our simulation points\nin the following analysis.\nNext we attempt to fit our data assuming the following polynomial function in m2\u03c0 ,\na0\n= A10 + A20 m2\u03c0 + A30 m4\u03c0 .\nm\u03c0\n\n(35)\n\nThe results of the fitting are plotted in Fig. 10 and summarized in Table V. At \u03b2 = 2.10\nthe value of \u03c72 /d.o.f. is large. This indicates that the fitting including higher order terms,\nsuch as m6\u03c0 term or higher, is necessary to obtain a more precise value at the physical pion\nmass. Such fitting cannot be carried out in this work, because the number of our simulation\npoints is only four.\nIn Refs. [2\u20134] the authors found that the mass dependence of the ratio (f\u03c0lat )2 * a0 /m\u03c0\nwas very small, where f\u03c0lat is the decay constant measured on the lattice at each m\u03c0 . In\nFig. 11 we plot the normalized scattering length defined by\n\u00e20\nf lat\n= \u03c0\nm\u03c0\nf\u03c0\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n*\n\na0\n,\nm\u03c0\n\n(36)\n\nwhere f\u03c0lat is the decay constants measured in Ref. [16], which are tabulated in Table VI,\nand f\u03c0 = 93 MeV. The values of \u00e20 /m\u03c0 are also tabulated in Appendix B; they are written\nunder the column for \u00c2(m\u03c0 , p)/m2\u03c0 defined by\nf lat\n\u00c2(m\u03c0 , p) = \u03c0\nf\u03c0\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n11\n\n* A(m\u03c0 , p).\n\n(37)\n\n\fIn the calculation of \u00e20 /m\u03c0 the statistical errors of f\u03c0lat are not included, since they are\nsmall compared with those of the scattering length. We observe in Fig. 11 that \u00e20 /m\u03c0 is\nalmost independent of m2\u03c0 within the statistical errors. This fact implies a strong correlation\nbetween the scattering length and the decay constant. The results of a constant fitting for\n\u00e20 /m\u03c0 are also plotted in the figure and tabulated in Table VII. The values of \u03c72 /d.o.f. are\nreasonably small. Especially at \u03b2 = 2.10 it is much smaller than that of the polynomial\nfitting for a0 /m\u03c0 .\nIn Fig. 12 we present a0 m\u03c0 at the physical pion mass obtained by the polynomial fitting\ndefined by Eq.(35) and \u00e20 m\u03c0 by the constant fitting as a function of the lattice spacing. We\nalso plot the results of the continuum extrapolations, which are summarized in Table VIII.\nThe prediction of ChPT [28]: a0 m\u03c0 = \u22120.0444(10) is denoted by the star symbol in the\nfigure. We see large O(a) effects in both a0 m\u03c0 and \u00e20 m\u03c0 . Furthermore the O(a) effect for\n\u00e20 m\u03c0 is opposite to that of a0 m\u03c0 due to large O(a) effects in f\u03c0lat . The difference between\nthem decreases going toward the continuum limit.\nAs shown in Fig. 12 \u00e20 m\u03c0 in the continuum limit is closer to the prediction of ChPT\nthan that of a0 m\u03c0 . We should note, however, that the decay constant is introduced in \u00e20 /m\u03c0\nto compensate the mass dependence of the scattering length. Extrapolations only with the\nscattering length are difficult as discussed before.\nThe decay constant measured in the previous work of Ref. [16], is tabulated in Table VI.\nAs shown in the table, the value in the continuum limit seems not consistent with the\nexperiment f\u03c0 = 93 MeV. One of possible reasons for this discrepancy is an uncertainty\nof the renormalization factor for the axial vector current; in Ref. [16] the perturbative\nrenormalization factor was used. This causes a large uncertainty in the prediction of the\nscattering length in the continuum limit. In order to obtain more reliable predictions for the\nphysical scattering length, a non-perturbative determination of the renormalization factor\nand higher statics calculations of the scattering length closer to the physical pion mass\nand the continuum limit are needed. Here we present the two values estimated by a0 m\u03c0\nand \u00e20 m\u03c0 = (f\u03c0lat /f\u03c0 )2 * a0 m\u03c0 as our results for the scattering length in this work with the\nprovisions noted above:\na0 m\u03c0 = \u22120.0558(56),\n\u00e20 m\u03c0 = \u22120.0413(29).\n\n(38)\n(39)\n\nC. Result for scattering phase shift\n\nThe results for the scattering amplitudes A(m\u03c0 , p) defined by Eq.(31) are plotted in\nFig. 13. The CMn in the top left figure refers to the amplitude obtained from the n-th\nenergy eigenstate state in the CM system, and the L1n and L2n to those in each laboratory\nsystem. The ordering of the amplitude, CM0 , L10 , L20 , * * *, L11 , in the other figures is the\nsame. The open symbols are excluded from the following analysis. They correspond to the\ndata in which we cannot clearly observe a single exponential time behavior of Dn (t) as noted\nin Sec. IV A. The values of A(m\u03c0 , p) are tabulated in Appendix B.\nWe obtain the scattering phase shift \u03b4(p) at the physical pion mass for various momenta\np in the continuum limit by the following procedure. First we fit the results of A(m\u03c0 , p)\nwith the following fitting assumption at each lattice spacing,\n12\n\n\fA(m\u03c0 , p) = A10 m2\u03c0 + A20 m4\u03c0 + A30 m6\u03c0 + A01 p2 + A11 m2\u03c0 p2 + A21 m4\u03c0 p2 .\n\n(40)\n\nThen we evaluate the amplitudes at the physical pion mass for various momenta at each\nlattice spacing from the constants Aij obtained by the fitting. Finally the continuum extrapolation is taken for these amplitudes at each momentum. The results of the fitting with\nthe assumption Eq.(40) are plotted in Fig. 13, and the constants Aij are tabulated together\nwith \u03c72 /d.o.f. in Table IX. The values of \u03c72 /d.o.f. are reasonably small at all \u03b2 in contrast\nto the polynomial fit for the scattering length where \u03c72 /d.o.f. at \u03b2 = 2.10 is large as shown\nin Sec. IV B.\nIt is possible to make a global polynomial fit with the assumption Eq.(40) for all momentum systems, so that we do not need to introduce the decay constant measured on the lattice\nas for the scattering length in the previous section. For consistency of the analysis, we also\nanalyze \u00c2(m\u03c0 , p) defined by Eq.(37). Here we assume the same fitting assumption Eq.(40),\nbut set A20 = A30 = A21 = 0, since the mass dependence becomes mild by a compensation\nwith that of the decay constant also in this case. The fit results are tabulated in Table X.\nIn Fig. 14 both amplitudes at the physical pion mass for various momenta are plotted\nas a function of the lattice spacing, together with the continuum extrapolations. Here we\nchoose three momenta, p2 = 0, 0.06 and 0.26 GeV2 which are roughly equal to the momenta\nof CM0 , L10 and CM1 , respectively. The result at p2 = 0 gives the scattering length a0 m\u03c0 .\nWe also plot the scattering lengths obtained in the previous section, which are calculated\nfrom the data only in CM0 . As shown in the figure they are consistent within the statistical\nerror at each lattice spacing. There are slight differences, however, in the continuum limit\nbetween the results obtained from all momentum system at p2 = 0 given by\na0 m\u03c0 = \u22120.0484(49),\n\u00e20 m\u03c0 = \u22120.0404(24),\n\n(41)\n(42)\n\nand the results from only the CM0 data given by Eqs.(38) and (39). We consider that these\ndiscrepancies represent the uncertainty of the continuum extrapolations using data at only\nthree lattice spacings, e.g., the number of degrees of freedom for the extrapolation is one,\nfar from the continuum limit. The difference of the two amplitudes tends to vanish in the\ncontinuum limit. As mentioned in the previous section, however, there is an uncertainty\nin the determination of the decay constant on the lattice. Thus we do not use \u00c2(m\u03c0 , p) to\nobtain the final results of the phase shift.\nIn Fig. 15 the result of the phase shift obtained from the scattering amplitude A(m\u03c0 , p)\nin the continuum limit is presented by a dashed line, and associated by a band of error\nbars. The values of the phase shift at several momenta are tabulated in Table XI. Our\nresults are compared with the solid curve [28] estimated with the experimental input, and\nthe experimental results [30,31]. The result in the continuum limit agrees with experiment,\nalthough the errors of our result are large. In order to obtain more precise results simulations\nare needed closer to the chiral and the continuum limits with much higher statistics.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this article we have presented our results for the I=2 S-wave \u03c0\u03c0 scattering phase shift\nin the continuum limit calculated with two-flavor dynamical quark effects. While errors are\n13\n\n\fnot small, it is very encouraging to find that the phase shift in the continuum limit shows a\nreasonable agreement with experiment.\nThe large errors of our final results arise from the chiral extrapolation and the continuum\nextrapolation. In order to obtain more precise results, simulations are needed closer to the\nchiral and the continuum limits with much higher statistics. Technically, investigating the\ncorrelation we found between the scattering length and the decay constant measured on\nlattice, and detecting effects of chiral symmetry breaking with Wilson fermion action are\nimportant open issues for future work.\nIn addition to being a first calculation of realistic scattering quantity based on first\nprinciples of QCD, the importance of the present work resides in actually showing that\nvarious technical methods, such as diagonalization of pion four-point functions and use of\nlaboratory systems, necessary for practical success of the finite-volume methods work. Thus\nwe can envisage a perspective toward extension of the present work for calculations of other\nimportant scattering process, such as I = 1 and I = 0 two-pion systems, systems including\nunstable particles, and scattering with baryons, which are richer in physics content. These\nprocesses are more difficult from the point of calculations, however, and algorithmic advances\nare probably needed to evaluate complicated diagrams.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work is supported in part by Grants-in-Aid of the Ministry of Education\n(Nos. 12304011, 12640253, 13135204, 13640259, 13640260, 14046202, 14740173, 15204015,\n15540251, 15540279, 15740134 ).

This problem has already been discussed by L\u00fcscher in Appendix A of Ref. [10] and in Appendix C of Ref. [11] for the center of mass system, and by\nRummukainen and Gottlieb in Sec. 5.2 of Ref. [17] for general systems. Our basic idea is\nthe same, but our final expression for the zeta function is simpler and more efficient for numerical evaluations. (We find that there are some typographical errors in the expression of\nthe zeta function in Ref. [17]). Very recently Li and Liu have reported a similar calculation\nmethod of the zeta function in asymmetric box [32].\nd\nThe definition of the zeta function Z00\n(s; m) is\n\u221a\nX\nd\n(r 2 \u2212 m)\u2212s .\n4\u03c0 * Z00\n(s; m) =\n(A1)\nd\nZ00\n(s; m)\n\nr\u2208P d\n\nThe summation for r is carried out over the set\nP d = {r|r = \u03b3\u0302 \u22121 (n + d/2), n \u2208 Z 3 }.\n\n(A2)\n\nThe operation \u03b3\u0302 \u22121 is the inverse Lorentz transformation : \u03b3\u0302 \u22121 n = 1/\u03b3 * n|| + n\u22a5 where\nn|| = (n * d)d/d2 is the parallel component and n\u22a5 = n \u2212 n|| the perpendicular component\n14\n\n\fd\nof n in the direction d. The zeta function Z00\n(s; m) takes a finite value for Re s > 3/2,\nd\nand Z00 (1; m), which is used to obtain the scattering phase shift in Eq.(9), is defined by the\nanalytic continuation from the region Re s > 3/2.\nd\nFirst we divide the summation in Z00\n(s; m) into two parts as\n\nX\nr\n\n(r 2 \u2212 m)\u2212s =\n\n(r 2 \u2212 m)\u2212s +\n\nX\n\nr 2 <m\n\nX\n\n(r 2 \u2212 m)\u2212s ,\n\n(A3)\n\nr 2 >m\n\nwhere the summation over r is carried out with r \u2208 P d .
