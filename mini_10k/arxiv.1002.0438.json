We show that a compact embedded constant mean curvature annulus in R3 tangent to two spheres of same radius along its boundary curves\nand having non-vanishing Gaussian curvature is part of a Delaunay surface.\nIn special, if the annulus is minimal, then the annulus is part of a catenoid.\nSecondly we show that a compact embedded constant mean curvature annulus with negative (respectively, positive) Gaussian curvature meeting a sphere\ntangentially and a plane in constant contact angle \u2265 \u03c0/2 (respectively, \u2264 \u03c0/2)\nis part a Delaunay surface. In special, if the annulus is minimal and the contact angle is \u2265 \u03c0/2, then it is part of a catenoid.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 53A10.\n\nCatenoid is the only nonplanar minimal surface of rotation in R3 [3]. Rotational surfaces of constant mean curvature in R3 are called the Delaunay surfaces:\ncylinders, spheres, unduloids and nodoids. Therefore catenoid and Delaunay surface meet every plane, which is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, in constant\ncontact angle. Conversely, if a compact embedded minimal or constant mean curvature surface meets two parallel planes in constant contact angles, then the surface\nis part of a catenoid or part of a Delaunay surface. This can be proved by using\nthe Alexandrov's moving plane argument [6] to planes perpendicular to the parallel planes. A compact immersed minimal annulus meeting two parallel planes\nin constant contact angles is also part of a catenoid. This result is not true for\nconstant mean curvature surfaces: Wente had constructed examples of immersed\nconstant mean curvature annuli in a slab or in a ball meeting the boundary planes\nor the boundary sphere perpendicularly [10]. Compared to the above first case,\nwe may ask whether a compact minimal annulus or a compact embedded constant\nmean curvature annulus meeting two spheres in constant contact angles is part of a\ncatenoid or part of a plane. In [9], it is shown that if a compact embedded minimal\nannulus meets two concentric spheres perpendicularly then the minimal annulus is\npart of a plane.\nIn this paper, we show that a compact embedded constant mean curvature annulus A in R3 meeting two spheres S1 and S2 of same radius \u03c1 tangentially and having\nnon-vanishing Gaussian curvature K is part of a Delaunay surface. More precisely,\n1\n\n\f2\n\nS.-H. PARK\n\ndepending on the values of K and the mean curvature H we have three cases: i)\nK < 0 and H > \u22121/\u03c1, in which case A is part of a unduloid if H < 0, part of a\ncatenoid if H = 0 and part of a nodoid if H > 0, ii) K > 0 and \u22121/\u03c1 < H < \u22121/2\u03c1,\nin which case A is part of a unduloid, and iii) K > 0 and H < \u22121/\u03c1, in which case\nA is part of a nodoid. In the first two cases, A stays outside of the balls B1 and\nB2 bounded by S1 and S2 . If iii) holds, then A \u2282 B1 \u2229 B2 .\nWe also show that a compact embedded constant mean curvature annulus B in\nR3 with negative (respectively, positive) Gaussian curvature meeting a unit sphere\ntangentially and a plane in constant contact angle \u2265 \u03c0/2 (respectively, \u2264 \u03c0/2) is\npart of a Delaunay surface. In special, a compact embedded minimal annulus in\nR3 meeting a sphere tangentially and a plane in constant contact angle \u2265 \u03c0/2 is\npart of a catenoid.\nTo prove Theorem 1 and 2, we use the \u2212\u03c1-parallel surface \u00c3 of A (respectively, B\u0303\nof B): the parallel surface of A (respectively, of B) with distance \u03c1 in the direction\nto the centers of the spheres. We use the Alexandrov's moving plane argument [2],\n[6] to prove that \u00c3 and B\u0303 are rotational. Since \u00c3 and B\u0303 are the parallel surfaces\nof A and B respectively, A and B are also rotational and, hence, are part of a\nDelaunay surface or part of a catenoid.\n\n1. constant mean curvature annulus meeting spheres tangentially\nIn the following, we may assume that the spheres have radius 1. Let A be\na compact embedded annulus with constant mean curvature H and meeting two\nunit spheres S1 and S2 tangentially along the boundary curves \u03b31 and \u03b32 . We\nfix the unit normal N of A to point away from the centers of the spheres. Let\nY : A(1, R) \u2192 R3 be a conformal parametrization of A from an annulus A(1, R) =\np\n{(x, y) \u2208 R2 : 1 \u2264 x2 + y 2 \u2264 R}. We define X by X = Y \u25e6 exp on the strip\nB = {(u, v) \u2208 R2 : 0 \u2264 u \u2264 log R}. Then X is periodic with period 2\u03c0. Let\nz = u + iv and \u03bb2 := |Xu |2 = |Xv |2 .\nLet hij , i, j = 1, 2, be the coefficients of the second fundamental form of X with\nrespect to N . Note that the Hopf differential \u03c6(z)dz 2 = (h11 \u2212 h22 \u2212 2ih12 )dz 2 is\nholomorphic for constant mean curvature surfaces [6]. The theorem of Joachimstahl\n[4] says that \u03b31 and \u03b32 are curvature lines of A. Hence h12 \u2261 0 on u = 0 and\nu = log R. Since h12 is harmonic and periodic, we have h12 \u2261 0 on B. This\nimplies that z is a conformal curvature coordinate and h11 \u2212 h22 = constant [7].\nLet c = h11 \u2212 h22 . If A is minimal, then we have K < 0 and c = 2h11 > 0 by the\nchoice of N . When H = \u22121, A is part of the unit sphere S1 = S2 by the boundary\ncomparison principle for mean curvature operator [5]. We assume that H 6= \u22121 in\nthe following. The principal curvatures of A are\n(1)\n\n\u03ba1 = H +\n\nc\nc\nand \u03ba2 = H \u2212 2 .\n2\u03bb2\n2\u03bb\n\n\fEMBEDDED MINIMAL AND CMC ANNULUS TOUCHING SPHERES\n\n3\n\nWe parameterize \u03b31 and \u03b32 by \u03b31 (v) = X(0, v) and \u03b32 (v) = X(log R, v) for\nv \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). In the following, we assume that A has non-vanishing Gaussian curvature.\np\nLemma 1. Each \u03b3i (v), i = 1, 2, has constant speed c/2(1 + H) and \u03ba2 is \u22121\non \u03b31 and \u03b32 . As spherical curves, \u03b31 and \u03b32 are convex. On A \\ \u2202A, we have\n\u03bb2 < c/2(1 + H) when K < 0 and \u03bb2 > c/2(1 + H) when K > 0.\nProof. The curvature vector of \u03b31 (v) is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nXv\nXv\n1 d\n=\n(2)\nXvv \u2212\n(Xv * Xvv )\n~\u03ba =\n|Xv | dv |Xv |\n|Xv |2\n|Xv |4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n\u03bbu\n=\n\u2212 Xu + h22 N .\n\u03bb2\n\u03bb\n\nLet the center of S1 be the origin of R3 . Since A is tangential to S1 along \u03b31 ,\nwe have N (0, v) = X(0, v) = \u03b31 (v) on \u03b31 . Since \u03b31 is on the unit sphere S1 , the\ncurvature vector ~\u03ba of \u03b31 satisfies (~\u03ba * \u03b31 )(v) = \u22121. Hence we have \u03ba2 = h\u03bb22\n2 = \u22121 on\np\n2\n2\n\u03b31 . Since \u03bb = |\u03b31 v | on \u03b31 , we have |\u03b31 v | = c/2(1 + H) from (1). By choosing\nthe center of S2 as the origin of R3 , we get the results for \u03b32 .\nThe Gaussian curvature K satisfies\n\u2206 log \u03bb = \u2212K\u03bb2 ,\nwhere \u2206 =\n\n\u22022\n\u2202u2\n\n+\n\n\u22022\n\u2202v 2 .\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as\n\u03bb\u2206\u03bb = |\u2207\u03bb|2 \u2212 K\u03bb4 .\n\n(3)\n\nSince \u03bbv (0, v) = 0 and \u03bbv (log R, v) = 0 and K 6= 0, \u03bb does not have interior maximum when K < 0, and does not have interior minimum when K > 0. Since\n\u03bb2 = c/2(1 + H) on \u03b31 and \u03b32 , it follows that \u03bb2 < c/2(1 + H) on A \\ \u2202A when\nK < 0 and \u03bb2 > c/2(1 + H) when K > 0. Moreover we have \u03bbu \u2264 0 on u = 0 and\n\u03bbu \u2265 0 on u = log R when K < 0 and \u03bbu \u2265 0 on u = 0 and \u03bbu \u2264 0 on u = log R\nXu\nwhen K > 0. Since |X\n\u2208 T Si is perpendicular to \u03b3i , the geodesic curvature of\nu|\n\u03b3i as a spherical curve is ~\u03ba *\ncurves.\n\u0003\n\nXu\n|Xu |\n\n= \u2212 \u03bb\u03bbu2 . Hence \u03b31 and \u03b32 are convex as spherical\n\nRemark 1. If \u03bb2 \u2261 c/2(1 + H) on A, then K \u2261 0 and A is part of a cylinder.\n2. \u22121-parallel surface\nThe \u22121-parallel surface \u00c3 of A is defined by\nX\u0303 = X \u2212 N.\nThe image of \u03b31 (respectively, of \u03b32 ) in \u00c3 is a point corresponding to the center\nof S1 (respectively, of S2 ). We denote the centers of S1 and S2 by O and O2 for\n\n\f4\n\nS.-H. PARK\n\nsimplicity. We fix the unit normal \u00d1 of \u00c3 to be N . Since z = u + iv is a curvature\ncoordinate of X, we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh22\nh11\n(4)\nX\u0303u = 1 + 2 Xu and X\u0303v = 1 + 2 Xv .\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nSince \u03ba2 = \u22121 on \u03b3i (Lemma 1), X\u0303 is singular for u = 0 and u = log R. By Lemma\n1, we have \u03bb2 6= c/2(1 + H) on A \\ \u2202A, which implies that 1 + \u03ba2 6= 0 on A \\ \u2202A.\nWhen K < 0, we have \u03ba1 > 0 on A \\ \u2202A. Hence X\u0303 is regular for 0 < u < log R\nand we have H > \u22121.\nNow suppose that K > 0. Since \u03ba2 = \u22121 on \u03b3i (Lemma 1), we have \u03ba1 < 0 and\nH < \u22121/2. We consider two cases separately: H < \u22121 and \u22121 < H < \u22121/2. If\nH < \u22121, then c < 0 from \u03bb2 = c/2(1 + H) > 0 on \u03b3i . Hence we have \u03ba1 < \u22121,\nwhich implies that X\u0303 is regular for 0 < u < log R. If \u22121 < H < \u22121/2, then we must\nhave c > 0. This implies that 1 + \u03ba1 6= 0. Otherwise we have 0 < 2\u03bb2 (1 + H) = \u2212c,\nwhich contradicts c > 0. Hence X\u0303 is regular for 0 < u < log R.\nRemark 2. When K < 0 or K > 0 and \u22121 < H < \u22121/2, A stays outside of the\nballs B1 and B2 bounded by S1 and S2 . If K > 0 and H < \u22121, then A \u2282 B1 \u2229 B2 .\nLemma 2. The mean curvature H\u0303 and the Gaussian curvature K\u0303 of \u00c3 satisfies\n(1 + H)K\u0303 = (1 + 2H)H\u0303 \u2212 H. On \u00c3 \\ {O, O2 }, we have\ni) if K < 0 and H > \u22121, then \u03ba\u03031 > 0, \u03ba\u03032 > 1 and H\u0303 > 1,\nii) if K > 0 and \u22121 < H < \u22121/2, then 0 < c/2\u03bb2 (1+H) < min{1, \u2212H/(1+H)},\n\u03ba\u03031 < 0, \u03ba\u03032 < H/(1 + H) and H\u0303 < H/(1 + H), and\niii) if K > 0 and H < \u22121, then 0 < c/2\u03bb2 (1 + H) < 1, \u03ba\u03031 > (1 + 2H)/2(1 + H),\n\u03ba\u03032 > H/(1 + H) and H\u0303 > H/(1 + H).\nProof.

First suppose that K < 0. Then we have \u03ba1 > 0, which\nimplies that \u03ba\u03031 = \u03ba1 /(1 + \u03ba1 ) > 0. Since c/2\u03bb2 (1 + H) > 1 by Lemma 1, we have\n\u03ba\u03032 > 1 and H\u0303 > 1.\nWhen K > 0, we have \u03ba1 = H + c/2\u03bb2 < 0. If \u22121 < H < \u22121/2, then we\nhave c > 0 because \u03bb2 = c/2(1 + H) > 0 on \u03b3i . It follows that c/2\u03bb2 (1 + H) <\n\u2212H/(1 + H). By Lemma 1, we also have c/2\u03bb2 (1 + H) < 1. Therefore we have\n0 < c/2\u03bb2 (1 + H) < min{1, \u2212H/(1 + H)}.

Note that \u03bd is a closed curve in the unit sphere S1 .\nProof. Let \u03bd(v) = |X\nu|\nWe claim that \u03bd is convex as a spherical curve. Otherwise, there is a great circle \u03b7\nintersecting the image of \u03bd at no less than 3 points \u03bd(v1 ), . . . , \u03bd(vn ). (\u03bd may map\nan interval (va , vb ) \u2282 [0, 2\u03c0) into a single point. We choose vi 's in such a way that \u03bd\nmaps no two vi 's to the same point.) Each \u03bd(vi ) determines a great circle S1vi \u2282 S1\ncontained in the plane perpendicular to \u03bd(vi ). At each \u03b31 (vi ), \u03b31 is tangent to\nS1vi . Since \u03b7 and S1vi are perpendicular, \u03b31 cannot be convex when n \u2265 3. Hence\n\u03bd intersect every geodesic of S1 at no more than two points. This shows that \u03bd is\nXu\nconvex as a spherical curve. Similarly, |X\n(log R, v) is also convex as a spherical\nu|\ncurve.\nSince \u00c3 is a parallel surface of A, the tangent cone T an(O, \u00c3) of \u00c3 at O is\nthe cone formed by rays from O through \u03bd. Since \u03bd is a convex spherical curve,\nT an(O, \u00c3) is convex. This shows that a small neighborhood of O in \u00c3 is embedded\nand nonnegatively curved as a metric space [1]. Similarly, there is a neighborhood\nof O2 in \u00c3 which is embedded and nonnegatively curved as a metric space.\nHadamard showed that a closed surface in R3 with strictly positive Gaussian\ncurvature is the boundary of a convex body [6]. In particular, S is embedded.\n\n\f6\n\nS.-H. PARK\n\nAlexandrov generalized Hadamard's theorem to nonnegatively curved metric spaces\n[1].

A compact embedded constant mean curvature annulus A with nonvanishing Gaussian curvature and meeting two spheres S1 and S2 of same radius\ntangentially is part of a Delaunay surface. In special, if A is minimal, then A is\npart of a catenoid.\nProof. We suppose that the radius of S1 and S2 is 1. By Lemma 2 and Lemma 3,\n\u00c3 is a compact embedded surface with two singular points O and O2 and satisfying\n(1 + H)K\u0303 = (1 + 2H)H\u0303 \u2212 H at regular points. A small neighborhood of a regular\npoint of \u00c3 can be represented as the graph of a function f (x, y) satisfying\n(5)\n\n2\n) + 2H(1 + fx2 + fy2 )2\n2(1 + H)(fxx fyy \u2212 fxy\n\n\u0001\n1\n= (1 + 2H) (1 + fy2 )fxx \u2212 2fx fy fxy + (1 + fx2 )fyy (1 + fx2 + fy2 ) 2 .\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as\n\n\u0001\ndet 2(1 + H)D2 f + A(Df ) = W 4 ,\n!\nq\n(1 + fx2 )W\nfx fy W\nwhere A(Df ) = \u2212(1 + 2H)\nand\nW\n=\n1 + fx2 + fy2 .\nfx fy W\n(1 + fy2 )W\nThe equation (6) is elliptic with respect to f if 2(1 + H)D2 f + A(Df ) is positive\n\u0001\ndefinite. Since det 2(1 + H)D2 f + A(Df ) = W 4 > 0, (6) is elliptic if\n\u0001\n(7) Tr 2(1 + H)D2 f + A(Df ) = 2(1 + H)\u2206f \u2212 (1 + 2H)(2 + fx2 + fy2 )W\n(6)\n\nis strictly positive.\nFirst we consider the case K < 0.

We may assume that f is defined on B(0, \u01eb) \u2282 Tp \u00c3 so that\n\u2207f (0) = ~0 and D2 f is diagonal. For sufficiently small \u01eb = \u01eb(p), (8) implies that (7)\nis strictly positive. Hence (6) is elliptic with respect to f representing \u00c3.\nWhen \u22121 < H < \u22121/2, (7) is automatically satisfied.\n\n\fEMBEDDED MINIMAL AND CMC ANNULUS TOUCHING SPHERES\n\n7\n\nNow we consider the case K > 0 and H < \u22121. Since H\u0303 > H/(1 + H) by Lemma\n2, we have\n(9)\n\n\u2206f + fy2 fxx \u2212 2fx fy fxy + fx2 fyy >\n\n2H\nW 3/2 .\n1+H\n\nAssuming that f is defined on B(0, \u01eb) \u2282 Tp \u00c3 with \u2207f (0) = ~0 and D2 f is diagonal,\n1+2H\n(9) implies that \u2206f \u2212 2(1+H)\n(2 + fx2 + fy2 )W is strictly positive for sufficiently small\n\u0001\n\u01eb. Then det \u22122(1 + H)D2 f \u2212 A(Df ) = W 4 is elliptic for f representing \u00c3. The\nellipticity of (6) for f representing \u00c3 enables us to use the maximum principle and\nthe boundary point lemma [5].\nSince \u00c3 is convex and embedded, we can use Alexandrov's moving plane argument [2], [6] to show that \u00c3 is rotational as follows. Let \u03a0\u03b8 be the plane containing\n~ which is\nthe line segment OO 2 \u2282 R3 and making angle \u03b8 with a fixed vector E\nperpendicular to OO 2 . Fix a positive constant L such that each plane \u03a0L\n\u03b8 , which\nis parallel to \u03a0\u03b8 with distance L from \u03a0\u03b8 , does not meet \u00c3 for all \u03b8. Let \u03a0l\u03b8 be\nl\nthe plane between \u03a0L\n\u03b8 and \u03a0\u03b8 with distance l from \u03a0\u03b8 . When \u03a0\u03b8 intersects \u00c3, we\nL\nl\nreflect the \u03a0\u03b8 side part of \u00c3 about \u03a0\u03b8 . Let us denote this reflected surface \u00c3ref\nl,\u03b8 .\nAs we decrease l from L, there might be the first l\u03b8 \u2265 0 for which \u00c3ref\nl\u03b8 ,\u03b8 is tangent\nref\nto \u00c3 at an interior point or at a boundary point of \u2202 \u00c3l\u03b8 ,\u03b8 . We call this point as the\nfirst touch point. If there is no nonnegative l with the first touch point, we repeat\nthe process for \u03a0L\n\u03b8+\u03c0 to find l\u03b8+\u03c0 , which must be positive. At the first touch point,\nwe apply the comparison principles for (5) to see that the part of \u00c3 in the \u03a0\u03b8 side\nand \u00c3ref\nl\u03b8 ,\u03b8 are identical and, hence, l\u03b8 = 0. This implies that \u03a0\u03b8 is a symmetry\nplane for \u00c3. Since \u03b8 can be chosen arbitrarily, \u00c3 should be rotational and, hence,\nA is also rotational. Since the Delaunay surfaces and the catenoid are the only\nnonplanar rotational minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces, A is part of a\na Delaunay surface or part of a catenoid.\n\u0003\nWe used the embeddedness of A in proving that \u00c3 is embedded. Whether there\nis a non-embedded minimal or constant mean curvature annulus meeting two unit\nspheres tangentially is an interesting question. Moreover we raise the following\nquestions.\n1. Is a compact immersed minimal annulus or a compact embedded minimal or\nconstant mean curvature surface meeting a sphere perpendicularly or in constant\ncontact angles part of a catenoid or part of a Delaunay surface? Nitsche showed\nthat an immersed disk type minimal or constant mean curvature surface meeting a\nsphere in constant contact angle is either a flat disk or a spherical cap [8].\n2. Is a compact immersed minimal annulus or a compact embedded minimal or\nconstant mean curvature surface meeting two spheres in constant contact angles\npart of a catenoid or a plane or part of a Delaunay surface?\n\n\f8\n\nS.-H. PARK\n\n3. Is a compact immersed minimal or constant mean curvature annulus or a\ncompact embedded minimal or constant mean curvature surface meeting a sphere\nand a plane in constant contact angles part of a catenoid or part of a Delaunay\nsurface? We give an affirmative answer to this problem in a special case in the\nfollowing.\nTheorem 2. A compact embedded constant mean curvature annulus B with negative (respectively, positive) Gaussian curvature meeting a sphere tangentially and a\nplane in constant contact angle \u2265 \u03c0/2 (respectively, \u2264 \u03c0/2) is part of a Delaunay\nsurface. In special, if B is minimal and the constant contact angle is \u2265 \u03c0/2 then B\nis part of a catenoid.\nThe angle is measured between the outward conormal of B and the outward\nconormal of the bounded domain in \u03a0 bounded by the boundary curve. Since the\nproof of this theorem is similar to that of Theorem 1, we omit some details which\nwas previously proved.\nProof. Let us denote the sphere by S2 and the plane by \u03a0. We may assume that\nthe radius of S2 is 1. Let \u03b1 be the constant contact angle between B and \u03a0. If\n\u03b1 = \u03c0/2, then we can reflect B about \u03a0 to get a constant mean curvature annulus\nmeeting two unit spheres tangentially. Hence B is part of a catenoid or a Delaunay\nsurface by Theorem 1.\nIn the following, we assume that \u03b1 6= \u03c0/2. As in the case for A in \u00a71, there is\na conformal parametrization X of B from a strip {(u, v) \u2208 R2 : 0 \u2264 u \u2264 log R} for\nwhich z = u + iv is a curvature coordinate. We fix the normal N of B to point away\nfrom the center of S2 . Let c1 (v) = X(0, v) be on \u03a0 and c2 (v) = X(log R, v) be on\np\nS2 with \u2202X3 /\u2202u > 0 along c1 . As in Lemma 1, c2 has constant speed c/2(1 + H)\nand \u03ba2 = \u22121 along c2 . Since K 6= 0 on B and z = u + iv is a curvature coordinate,\nwe have \u03ba2 < 0 on c1 . The curvature of c1 is |~\u03ba| = \u2212\u03ba2 / sin \u03b1 > 0, which shows\nthat c1 is locally convex. Since c1 is a Jordan curve, it is convex.\nXu\n= cos \u03b1 < 0 on c1 , it\nFirst, we assume that K < 0 and \u03b1 > \u03c0/2. Since |~~\u03ba\u03ba| * |X\nu|\nfollows from (2) that \u03bbu > 0 on c1 . Since \u03bbv (log R, v) = 0 (cf. Lemma 1), it follows\nfrom (3) that \u03bbu \u2265 0 on c2 . Otherwise, \u03bb will have an interior maximum, which\ncontradicts (3). Hence we have \u03bb2 < c/2(1 + H) on B \\ c2 . Note that \u03ba1 > 0 and\n\u03ba2 < 0 in B. From \u03bbu \u2264 0 on c2 , we see that c2 is convex as a spherical curve (cf.\nXu\nLemma 1). Arguing as in the proof of Lemma 3, we see that |X\n(log R, v) is also\nu|\nconvex as a spherical curve.\nXu\n= cos \u03b1 > 0 on c1 . Hence \u03bbu < 0\nWhen K > 0 and \u03b1 < \u03c0/2, we have |~~\u03ba\u03ba| * |X\nu|\non c1 . Since \u03bbv (log R, v) = 0, it follows from (3) that \u03bb does not have interior\nminimum. Then we have \u03bbu \u2264 0 on c2 and \u03bb2 > c/2(1 + H) on B \\ c2 . Note that\n\u03ba1 < 0 and \u03ba2 < 0 in B.

As in \u00a72, we can show that B\u0303 is regular\nexcept for O2 : the image of c2 , and H > \u22121 when K < 0 and H < \u22121/2 when\nK > 0. As in Lemma 2, we see that mean curvature H\u0303 and the Gaussian curvature\nK\u0303 of B\u0303 satisfies (1 + H)K\u0303 = (1 + 2H)H\u0303 \u2212 H and i) if K < 0 and H > \u22121,\nthen \u03ba\u03031 > 0, \u03ba\u03032 > 1 and H\u0303 > 1, ii) if K > 0 and \u22121 < H < \u22121/2, then 0 <\nc/2\u03bb2 (1+H) < min{1, \u2212H/(1+H)}, \u03ba\u03031 < 0, \u03ba\u03032 < H/(1+H) and H\u0303 < H/(1+H),\nand iii) if K > 0 and H < \u22121, then 0 < c/2\u03bb2 (1+H) < 1, \u03ba\u03031 > (1+2H)/2(1+H),\n\u03ba\u03032 > H/(1 + H) and H\u0303 > H/(1 + H).\nXu\n(log R, v) as a spherical curve implies that there is a neighThe convexity of |X\nu|\n\nborhood of O2 in B\u0303 which is embedded and nonnegatively curved as a metric space.\nLet \u03a0\u0303 be the plane parallel to \u03a0 and containing c\u03031 . The curvature of c\u03031 is |\u03ba\u03032 |/ sin \u03b1,\nwhich does not vanish. Hence c\u03031 is locally convex. Using the orthogonal projection\nonto \u03a0\u0303, c\u03031 may be considered as a sin \u03b1-parallel curve of c1 in \u03a0\u0303. Hence c\u03031 is also\na convex Jordan curve.\nSuppose that K < 0 and \u03b1 > \u03c0/2. Since \u03ba1 > 0, X\u0303u is a positive multiple of\nXu by (4). The positivity of \u03ba\u03031 and \u03ba\u03032 implies that B\u0303 meets \u03a0\u0303 in constant angle\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b1. Suppose that K > 0 and \u03b1 < \u03c0/2. If \u22121 < H < \u22121/2, then we have c > 0\nand \u03ba1 > \u22121. Hence X\u0303u is a positive multiple of Xu by (4). The negativity of \u03ba\u03031\nand \u03ba\u03032 implies that B\u0303 meets \u03a0\u0303 in constant angle \u03b1. When K > 0 and H < \u22121, we\nhave c < 0 and \u03ba1 < \u22121. Hence X\u0303u is negative multiple of Xu by (4). In this case,\nB\u0303 lies below \u03a0\u0303 and \u03ba\u03031 and \u03ba\u03032 are both positive. It is straightforward to see that B\u0303\nmeets \u03a0\u0303 in constant angle \u03b1.\nLet B\u0306 be the singular surface obtained from B\u0303 by attaching the disk in \u03a0\u0303 bounded\nby c\u03031 to B\u0303. Since B\u0303 meets \u03a0\u0303 in acute angle, B\u0306 is a nonnegatively curved metric\nspace. By Alexandrov's generalization of Hadamard's theorem [1], B\u0306 is the boundary of a convex body. Therefore B\u0306 is embedded. Note again that H\u0303, K\u0303, \u03ba \u03031 and \u03ba \u03032\nsatisfy the statements of Lemma 2. Hence (5) is elliptic for functions representing\nB\u0303 locally. We can apply Alexandrov's moving plane argument to B\u0303 using planes\nperpendicular to \u03a0\u0303 as in the proof of Theorem 1 to see that B\u0303 is rotational. Hence\nB is rotational and, as a result, is part of a Delaunay surface or part of a catenoid.\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n\nA. D.
