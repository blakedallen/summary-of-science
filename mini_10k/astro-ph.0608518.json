Introduction\nThe wind-accreting High Mass X-ray Binary system\n4U 1907+09 (Giacconi et al. 1971) consists of a neutron star in\nan eccentric (e = 0.28) 8.3753 d orbit (in 't Zand et al. 1998)\naround its companion, which has been identified optically\nwith a highly reddened mV = 16.37 mag star (Schwartz et al.\n1980). Using interstellar atomic lines of Na \uf769 and K \uf769, Cox et al.\n(2005) set a lower limit of 5 kpc for the distance. According to\nthis value a lower limit of the X-ray luminosity above 1 keV\nis given by 2 1036 erg s\u22121 (in 't Zand et al. 1997). Cox et al.\n(2005) also confirm earlier suggestions (Schwartz et al. 1980;\nMarshall & Ricketts 1980; van Kerkwijk et al. 1989) that the\nstellar companion is a O8\u2013O9 Ia supergiant with an effective\ntemperature of 30500 K, a radius of 26 R\u2299 , a luminosity of\n5 105 L\u2299 , and a mass loss rate of 7 10\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . Note that\nthe presence of X-ray flaring seen twice per neutron star orbit\n(Marshall & Ricketts 1980, see also Fig. 1) had led some\nSend offprint requests to: S.

The column is maximal between the end of the primary X-ray flare and the\nstart of the secondary flare (Fig. 1) of the orbital light curve\n(Roberts et al. 2001). Fluorescence in the absorbing material gives rise to an Fe K\u03b1 line at 6.4 keV with an equivalent width of \u223c60 eV (Cusumano et al. 1998). At higher energies, the spectrum exhibits cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSF) at \u223c19 keV and \u223c40 keV (Makishima et al. 1992;\nMihara 1995; Cusumano et al. 1998).\n\n\fS. Fritz et al.: Torque reversal of 4U 1907+09\n\n1.8\nASM\u2212Counts [sec\u22121]\n\nWith a pulse period of \u223c 440 s, 4U 1907+09 is a slowly\nrotating neutron star. Since the discovery of the pulsations by\nMakishima et al. (1984) the neutron star has exhibited a steady\nlinear spin down with an average of \u1e56pulse = +0.225 s yr\u22121 from\nPpulse = 437.5 s in 1983 to 440.76 s in 1998 (in 't Zand et al.\n1998). Recently, Baykal et al. (2005) reported a decrease in\n\u1e56pulse , which in 2002 was \u223c0.115 s yr\u22121 and therefore \u223c0.5\ntimes the long term value.\nIn this paper we report on an analysis of INTEGRAL observations of 4U 1907+09 performed since 2003. In Sect. 2 we\ndescribe the INTEGRAL data reduction, followed by a discussion of the broad-band X-ray spectrum of the source (Sect. 3).\nWe then present the results of the long term X-ray timing analysis (Sect. 4.1), showing that the source underwent a torque reversal towards a spin up (Sect. 4.2). We summarize and discuss\nour results in Sect. 5.\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\nIBIS\u2212Counts [sec\u22121]\n\n2\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n2. Observation and data reduction\nIn this paper we present the analysis of INTEGRAL observations of 4U 1907+09. The International Gamma-Ray\nAstrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL ; Winkler et al. 2003)\nwas launched in October 2002. The two main instruments\nIBIS (15 keV\u201310 MeV; Ubertini et al. 2003) and SPI (20 keV\u2013\n8 MeV; Vedrenne et al. 2003) are supplemented in the X-rays\nby an auxiliary instrument with a smaller field of view, the Xray monitor JEM-X (3 keV\u201335 keV; Lund et al. 2003). For our\nanalysis we used data from IBIS and JEM-X.\nThe Imager on Board the INTEGRAL Satellite (IBIS)\nis a coded mask telescope with a fully coded field of view\n(FCFOV) of 9\u25e6 \u00d7 9\u25e6 and 12.\u2032 9 full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) angular resolution (Ubertini et al. 2003; Brandt et al.\n2003). Here, we used data from its upper layer, the INTEGRAL\nSoft Gamma-Ray Imager (ISGRI), which covers an energy\nrange from 15 keV\u20131 MeV with an energy resolution of \u223c8%\nat 60 keV (Lebrun et al. 2003; Gros et al. 2003). 4U 1907+09\nis detected below \u223c90 keV. The Joint European X-ray Monitor\n(JEM-X) consists of two identical coded mask instruments\nwith a FCFOV of 4.\u25e6 8 diameter and 3.\u2032 35 angular resolution\n(FWHM), each (Lund et al. 2003). Due to erosion of the microstrip anodes inside the JEM-X detectors which leads to a\nloss in sensitivity, only one of the two JEM-X detectors is operating at any given time while the other is switched off.\nFor our analysis we took into account all public data up\nto INTEGRAL orbit (revolution) 250 as well as data from\nthe INTEGRAL Galactic Plane Scans (GPS) and the Galactic\nCentral Radian Deep Exposure (GCDE). In addition we also\nused private data from a monitoring campaign on the Galactic\nmicroquasar GRS 1915+105 (PI J. Rodriguez). To avoid systematic effects that start to become important for larger offaxis angles, we constrained the maximum off-axis angle between the satellite's optical axis and 4U 1907+09 to 4.\u25e6 5 for\nIBIS and 2.\u25e6 4 for JEM-X according to the respective FCFOVs\nof the instruments. In total, the analyzed data are spread over\nalmost three years with a total on source time of \u223c2280 ksec\nfor IBIS. The log of the observations is given in Table 2. We\nused the Off-line Scientific Analysis Software, OSA 5.1, in our\nanalysis.

While the standard OSA tools build\nlightcurves by deconvolving shadowgrams for each requested\nenergy band and time bin to obtain the light curves, which is\nonly possible if the signal to noise ratio in the shadowgram is\nhigh, ii light uses the Pixel Illuminated Fraction (PIF) to\ncreate light curves. For 4U 1907+09, this approach allows us\nto extract light curves with a resolution of 1 s. The count rates\nfound by ii light show no systematic difference between the\nsingle pointings. Tests based on observations of the Crab nebula and pulsar (Kreykenbohm et al. 2006) and the fact that the\ncount rates of 4U 1907+09 are not affected by the very variable flux of the nearby source GRS 1915+105 (Fig. 2) confirm\nthe stability of our extraction method. The light curves were\nbarycentered and corrected for the orbital motion of the neutron\nstar using the ephemeris of in 't Zand et al. (1998), as given in\nTable 1. Orbital phase 0 is at T 90 .\n\n3. Spectral Analysis\nFor the spectral analysis we applied systematic errors of 1%\nand 5% for IBIS and JEM-X2, respectively, and used data\ntaken in the energy ranges 18\u201390 keV and 5\u201320 keV.

Fritz et al.: Torque reversal of 4U 1907+09\n\nUsing an absorbed NPEX model, we obtain \u03c72red = 4.54 and\nalso observe line like features at 19 and 40 keV. Again we first\nfitted only one feature at 44.4 keV, resulting in a \u03c72red = 2.56.\nFitting these features with two Gaussians at 42.0 keV and\n18.7 keV improves the fit significantly resulting in \u03c72red = 1.16\n(F-Test: 8.7 \u00d7 10\u221213 ). See Table 4 for the complete set of\nmodel parameters. With the NPEX model it was not possible to constrain the Fe-line, however the upper limit for a line\nwith the same energy and sigma as in the Fermi-Dirac cutoff\nmodel is 9.7 10\u22124 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 , consistent with the results\nobtained for the continuum with a Fermi-Dirac cutoff. The continuum and line parameters measured with INTEGRAL are\nconsistent with the BeppoSAX results (Cusumano et al. 1998).\nOur measurements also confirm the BeppoSAX result that in\nthis source the second line is deeper than the fundamental\nline, a fact that can be explained by \"photon spawning\", i.e.,\nCompton scattering with multiple photon emission where a\nphoton with energy 2Ecyc,1 results in two photons with energy\nEcyc,1 (Alexander & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 1989). From our spectral fitting\nwe obtain an average flux of 2.6 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 20\u2013\n40 keV band.\n\n1\n\nnormalized counts s\u22121 keV\u22121\n\nsee Coburn et al. 2002) to the baseline continuum model results in a improved fit (\u03c72red = 2.49 for 47 degrees of freedom). The F-test probability that this improvement is achieved\njust by chance is 3.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 (see, however, Protassov et al.\n2002). Modeling both features with Gaussians at 39.8 keV and\n18.9 keV further improves \u03c72 significantly to \u03c72red = 1.00.\nThe F-Test probability for this case as opposed to the case\nwithout lines is 9.8 \u00d7 10\u221210 , confirming the unambiguous detection of the cyclotron lines. For this model we also added\nthe Fe-line which has been seen, e.g., in the BeppoSAX data\n(Cusumano et al. 1998). The best fit value for the line energy\nis 7.1 keV. The width of the line could not be constrained by\nour data, so we fixed it to 0 eV, corresponding to an equivalent\nwidth of 135 eV.\nTo exclude the possibility that the CRSFs are due to incorrect modeling of the continuum, we also used other continuum\nmodels1 including the NPEX model, which consists of negative and positive power laws with a common exponential cutoff\nfactor (Mihara 1995):\n!\nE\n\u2212\u03b11\n+\u03b12 \u0001\nexp \u2212\nC(E) = A1 E + A2 * E\n(2)\nEfold\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\n\u03c7\n\n4\n\n2\n0\n\u22122\n2\n0\n\u22122\n\n5\n\n10\n\nEnergy [keV]\n\n50\n\nFig. 3.

From MJD 51980 onwards 4U 1907+09 shows\na clear deviation from the long term spin down trend with a\ncomplete reversal to a spin up after MJD 53131. The solid line\nshows the fit of four distinct episodes of different, but constant,\n\u1e56.\nysis of RXTE data, however, taken during MJD 51980\u201352340\nshowed a spin down rate which is 0.5 times lower than the previous value (Baykal et al. 2005). Using our INTEGRAL data,\nwe can extend the pulse period evolution to the years 2003\u2013\n2005 (MJD 52739\u201353504).\n\n\f6\n\nS. Fritz et al.: Torque reversal of 4U 1907+09\n\nTo measure the pulse period of 4U 1907+09 we first performed epoch folding (Leahy et al. 1983) on each revolution\nseparately. Using these periods we derived pulse profiles for\neach revolution using the respective period. The pulse profiles\nwere then fitted by a sum of sine functions to determine the position of the trailing edge (see for example Fig 7 at phase 1.0)\nof the pulse to obtain absolute pulse arrival times and the differences between the arrival times of adjacent revolutions. From\nthese time differences the approximate number of pulse cycles\nbetween those absolute times was determined. For sufficiently\nwell sampled observations, those values are close to an integer number. These integer numbers are then taken to count the\ncycles throughout those well sampled subsets, and a model can\nbe constructed to calculate expected pulse arrival times (trailing\nedges). The observed times can then be compared with the calculated times and a polynomial fit to the observed times yields\nvalues for the period and its derivative. Care was taken that\nwithin subsets no miscounting was possible. Between subsets\nthe time gaps are too large such that they cannot be bridged\nuniquely and no statement about the period development during the gaps can be made. Using this procedure we were able\nto derive 12 periods with sufficient accuracy (see Table 6).\nFig. 5 shows the long-time history of the period evolution\nbased on all available data. The line indicates the historic spin\ndown trend with \u1e56pulse = +0.225 s yr\u22121 from in 't Zand et al.\n(1997). The recent periods obtained by Baykal et al. (2005)\nshow a clear deviation from the historic spin down trend. The\nperiods obtained from INTEGRAL (shown as diamonds), not\nonly confirm this change of the trend but show a complete trend\nreversal from the historic long term spin down trend to a spin\nup trend from MJD 53131 onwards (see Figs. 5 and 6).\nWe tried several models to fit this overall period evolution2.\nThe description of the data by three distinct episodes with a\nlinear spin down from MJD 45576 to MJD 50290 (\u1e56pulse =\n+0.235\u00b10.001 s yr\u22121 ), a parabolic turnover from MJD 50290 to\nMJD 53022 of the form P(T ) = P0 + \u1e56pulse,0 (T \u2212T 0 )+ P\u0308pulse,0 (T \u2212\nT 0 )2 /2 with T 0 = MJD 51321, \u1e56pulse,0 = +0.121 \u00b1 0.001 s yr\u22121\nand P\u0308pulse,0 = \u2212(7.743 \u00b1 0.002) 10\u22123 s yr\u22122 , and a linear spin up\nwith \u1e56pulse = \u22120.147 \u00b1 0.006 s yr\u22121 from MJD 53022 onwards\nresulted in \u03c72red = 8.74 for 34 degrees of freedom. Modeling the\nperiod evolution of 4U 1907+09 with four distinct episodes of\ndifferent, but constant, \u1e56 results in a slightly better \u03c72red (\u03c72red =\n7.2 for 34 dof, see Figs. 5 and 6). The four episodes are the historic spin down with \u1e56pulse = +0.230\u00b10.001 s yr\u22121 (MJD 45576\nto MJD 50610), the turnover with \u1e56pulse = +0.114\u00b10.001 s yr\u22121\n(MJD 50610 to MJD 52643) and \u1e56pulse = +0.026 \u00b1 0.003 s yr\u22121\n(MJD 52643 to MJD 53131), and finally the spin up with\n\u1e56pulse = \u22120.158 \u00b1 0.007 s yr\u22121 .\nUsing the derived periods, pulse profiles for all revolutions\nwere determined (Fig. 7) by folding the light curves with the\nbest respective periods. No change in the shape of the pulse\nprofile is detectable, and the INTEGRAL pulse profiles before\nand after the reversal of \u1e56 are consistent with each other. In\naddition, we also obtained energy resolved pulse profiles (see\n2\n\nFor this analysis we excluded the two period measurements by\nIXAE (Mukerjee et al. 2001) as outliers.

Summary and Discussion\nSince 2003, 4U 1907+09 was observed frequently with\nINTEGRAL. In this paper, we presented the results of the timing analysis of \u223c2280 ksec of IBIS data and of the spectral analysis of 1258 ksec of IBIS and 200 ksec of JEM-X2 data. Two\ncyclotron lines at \u223c19 keV and \u223c40 keV are detected, consistent with earlier Ginga and BeppoSAX results (Mihara 1995;\nCusumano et al. 1998). Assuming a gravitational redshift of\nz = (1 \u2212 (2GM/rc2 ))\u22121/2 \u2212 1 = 0.31 (assuming M = 1.4M\u2299\nand r = 106 cm), from these CRSF observations a B-field\nstrength of 2.15 \u00d7 1012 G can be inferred. Four flares in the\nX-ray lightcurves with durations between \u223c2500 s and \u223c7000 s\nwere observed, three of which are associated with the primary\nflare in the orbital lightcurve of 4U 1907+09.\nIn addition to these confirmations of earlier results, our\nINTEGRAL data show, for the first time, a clear spin up phase\nin 4U 1907+09 (Table 6 and in Figs. 5 and 6). After almost 20\nyears of constant spin down at a rate of \u1e56pulse = +0.225 s yr\u22121 ,\nwith the available data being consistent with P\u0308 = 0 s\u22121 , in\n2002 and 2003 first indications for a decrease in the magnitude\nof spin down were detected (Baykal et al. 2005). As shown\nin Sect. 4.2, the new INTEGRAL data show a torque reversal from \u223cMJD 53131 onwards, with the source now exhibiting a spin up with a rate of \u1e56pulse = \u22120.158 s yr\u22121 .

For\nprograde disks, the magnetic coupling between the accretion\ndisk and the neutron star and the transfer of angular momentum from the accreted matter onto the neutron star will lead to\na torque onto the neutron star resulting in spin up. The general\nexpectation of these models is that the accretion disk is close\nto equilibrium, i.e., the Alfv\u00e9n or magnetospheric radius, rm ,\nwhere the accretion flow couples to the magnetic field, is assumed to be close to the corotation radius, rco , where the disk's\nKepler frequency equals the rotational frequency of the neutron\nstar. For accretion to occur, rm . rco , as otherwise the onset of\nthe centrifugal barrier (the \"propeller effect\") prevents the material from falling onto the neutron star (Illarionov & Sunyaev\n1975).\nMost accreting neutron star systems, such as Her X-1 or\nVela X-1, show a secular spin up or spin down trend onto\n\nwhich short, large magnitude episodes of spin down or spin up\nare superimposed (Bildsten et al. 1997). These shorter episodes\nare often interpreted to be due to short term variations in\n\u1e40, which give rise to short-term torque fluctuations. In contrast to these systems, GX 1+4, 4U 1626\u221267, and 4U 1907+09\nshowed decade-long phases where \u1e56 did not change its sign.\nGX 1+4 was seen to spin up with a very short characteristic timescale, P/\u1e56 \u223c 40 years, from the early 1970s until the\nsource flux dropped below detectability in the EXOSAT era\nof the early 1980s. From 1985 onwards the source reemerged\nwith a strong spin down (Makishima et al. 1988; Mony et al.\n1991; Chakrabarty et al. 1997). Recent INTEGRAL observations show that this spin down has continued until at least 2004\n(Ferrigno et al. 2006). A second source with a long phase of\nunchanged sign of \u1e56 is the ultracompact low mass X-ray binary 4U 1626\u221267, which was spinning up between 1977 and\n1989, followed by a torque reversal and an extended spin down\nphase starting in 1991 (Chakrabarty et al. 1997). In contrast\nto GX 1+4, no luminosity drop was seen during the torque\nreversal and with |P/\u1e56| \u223c 5000 years the characteristic spin\nup and spin down timescales are significantly larger. Provided\nthat the torque reversal of 4U 1907+09 described in this paper\ndoes not change back in the next years, in its overall period\nbehavior, 4U 1907+09 resembles 4U 1626\u221267: both sources\nhave |P/\u1e56| \u223c several thousands of years and no change in\nluminosity was observed during the torque reversal. On the\nother hand, however, 4U 1907+09 is a high mass X-ray binary with a much longer orbital period, and thus shares similarities with the low mass X-ray binary GX 1+4, and furthermore 4U 1907+09 switched from spin down to spin up, while\nGX 1+4 and 4U 1626\u221267 switched from spin up to spin down.\nCommon for the three sources is that the magnitude of |P/\u1e56| is\nsimilar for the spin up and the spin down.\nWith the simple magnetic torquing model outlined above,\nthe long distinct episodes of roughly constant \u1e56 and the magnitude and sign of \u1e56 are difficult to explain: As discussed above,\nfor systems close to equilibrium it is expected that rm \u223c rco . In\nreality, however, this is not the case. In the case of 4U 1907+09,\nit was first pointed out by in 't Zand et al. (1998) that the magnetospheric radius inferred from the cyclotron line measurements is rm \u223c 2400 km, while rco \u223c 12000 km. Moving rm\nout to rco would require a magnetic field of \u223c1014 G, which\nis two orders of magnitude larger than the magnetic field\ndeduced from the observed cyclotron lines. Alternatively, \u1e40\ncould be significantly lower than the value inferred from the\nX-ray luminosity of the system. Assuming the efficiency of\naccretion is comparable to other systems, however, a low \u1e40\nwould imply a significantly smaller distance to 4U 1907+09\nthan allowed by its optical reddening, which seems equally unlikely. in 't Zand et al. (1998) argued that the presence of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) and the long term systematic trend\nin the spin down are strong indicators for the presence of a\naccretion disk in the system with a small inner disk radius.\nIn analogy to GX 1+4 (Chakrabarty et al. 1997, and references therein), these authors show that a transient retrograde\ndisk with a duty cycle of 1\u20135% could provide a sufficiently\nstrong torque to explain the observed spin down. This torquing\nwould coincide with a short term increase of source luminos-\n\n\fS. Fritz et al.: Torque reversal of 4U 1907+09\n\nity. in 't Zand et al. (1998) speculate that the X-ray flares indicate the presence of the retrograde disk, since a switch to\na retrograde disk would imply an increase in X-ray luminosity. They point out, however, that the \u223c1000 s duration of the\nflares seen in their RXTE data is too small with respect to\nthe required duty cycle for a retrograde disk. We note that the\nINTEGRAL results show flare durations of several ksec duration (Tab. 5), which is more in line with the expected duty\ncycle. Furthermore, the folded lightcurve of 4U 1907+09 indicates a brightening of the source around phase 0.6 (Fig. 1).\nWith 0.1Porb duration, this flare is long enough to easily accommodate the required duty cycle of the retrograde disk and\nto explain the observed \u1e56. We note, however, that not all of the\nbrightening seen in Fig. 1 is due to the flares identified by us as\nremoving these flares from the data still results in a clear peak\nat phase 0.6 in the folded lightcurve. Part of the brightening\ncould therefore be also due to an enhanced \u1e40 during this phase\nof the elliptical orbit of the neutron star, although we cannot\nfirmly exclude the presence of smaller flares which would not\nbe picked up due to our conservative definition of a flare.\nWhile the model of a retrograde disk can explain the magnitude of P/\u1e56, it is more difficult to reconcile the torque reversal found with INTEGRAL with this model. First of all,\nas discussed above, the four intervals of different \u1e56 represent\ndistinct episodes of different torques on the neutron star. In\nthe retrograde disk model, it is difficult to understand why\nthe characteristic spin up and spin down timescales appear\nso similar. Furthermore, these three phases would then correspond to different duty cycles of the retrograde disk, resulting\nin a change in observed flux. Such a behavior has been observed, e.g., in GX 1+4, where torque and luminosity are correlated during the spin down phase (Chakrabarty et al. 1997).\nNo such correlations are observable in 4U 1907+09, where the\nflux has not appreciably changed during the INTEGRAL and\nthe pointed RXTE observations (see also Baykal et al. 2005).\nIn addition, an analysis of the orbit-averaged 2\u201312 keV RXTE\nASM lightcurves also does not reveal a change in the soft Xray behavior of the source, and neither is a change in the X-ray\nlight curve with orbital phase observed.\nThe INTEGRAL observations also rule out the application\nof the torque reversals put forward by Murray et al. (1999) to\nexplain GX 1+4. In this model, the accretion disk is assumed\nto consist of several rings with opposite rotation. Between\nthese rings a gap is created such that a torque reversal should\nbe accompanied by a minimum in the accretion luminosity.\nThe model predicts a change in pulse profile from \"leadingedge bright\" during the spin down to \"trailing-edge bright\"\nduring the spin up. Both, a minimum in luminosity and a\nchange in the shape of the pulse profile are observed in GX\n1+4 (Greenhill et al. 1999), but neither effect is present in\n4U 1907+09 (see discussion above and Fig. 7).\nRecently, Perna et al. (2006) presented a new Ansatz to explain torque changes in accreting neutron stars, which does not\nrequire the presence of retrograde disks. This model makes use\nof the fact that X-ray pulsars are oblique rotators, i.e., the neutron star's magnetic field is tilted by an angle \u03c7 with respect\nto the axis of rotation of the neutron star. Assuming the accretion disk is situated in the neutron star's equatorial plane, for a\n\n9\n\nring of matter in the accretion disk, the magnetic field strength\nthen depends on the azimuthal angle and thus the boundary\nof the magnetosphere is asymmetric. As shown by Perna et al.\n(2006), such a configuration can lead to regions in the disk\nwhere the propeller effect is locally at work, while accretion\nfrom other regions is not inhibited (i.e., on a ring on the disk,\nthere are some regions with rm < rco and other regions with\nrm > rco ). This results in a nonlinear dependence of the accretion luminosity from the \u1e40 through the outer parts of the disk.\nA nontrivial consequence of this more realistic accretion geometry is that for values of \u03c7 greater than a critical value, \u03c7crit ,\nlimit cycles are present, where cyclic torque reversal episodes\nare possible without a change in \u1e40. For typical parameters.\n\u03c7crit is between \u223c25\u25e6 and \u223c45\u25e6 . We stress that the existence of\nthe limit cycles depends only on \u03c7 and on the pulsar's polar\nmagnetic field, B, and no variation of external parameters is required to trigger torque reversals. This fact is a big advantage\nof this model over the models discussed above.\nPerna et al. (2006) show that their model can explain the\nprincipal observed properties of GX 1+4, including the luminosity drop during torque reversal, except for the observed correlation between torque and luminosity during the spin down\nphase. For 4U 1626\u221267, assuming B = 2.5 \u00d7 1012 G and \u03c7 =\n68\u25e6 , all observed properties of the spin history of 4U 1626\u221267\nincluding the large and values of |P/\u1e56| before and after the\ntorque reversal and the virtually unchanged luminosity of the\nsource can be explained (in the model, the required change in\nluminosity is only \u223c5%). For these model parameters, the limit\ncycle of 4U 1626\u221267 is predicted to have a long period.\nThe similarity between the pulse histories of 4U 1907+09\nand 4U 1626\u221267 suggests that a similar model would also work\nfor the former source. We stress, however, that further quantitative work, which is outside the scope of this paper, is clearly\nrequired. Specifically, from a theoretical point of view we note\nthat the model of Perna et al. (2006) does not yet take changes\nin \u1e40 due to the orbital eccentricity into account and that the\ncurrent version of the model assumes the disk to be flat and\nin the equatorial plane of the neutron star, while more realistic\ndisks onto magnetized objects can be expected to be warped\nand precessing (e.g., Pfeiffer & Lai 2004, and therein). From\nan observational point of view, the donor stars in both systems are very different, with 4U 1626\u221267 being a low mass\nand 4U 1907+09 being a high mass system. Finally, we also\nemphasize that the torque reversal in 4U 1626\u221267 was from a\nspin up to a spin down, while for 4U 1907+09 it was from a\nspin down to a spin up. Since the torque reversal episodes are\ncyclic, however, we do not expect this latter difference to be of\nmajor importance.\nIn conclusion, the torque reversal of 4U 1907+09 with no\nassociated drop in luminosity and no change in the shape of\nthe pulse profile seem to be difficult to reconcile with models explaining the large P/\u1e56 through the presence of a retrograde disk. On the other hand, the proposal of Perna et al.\n(2006) to explain torque reversals through accretion onto an\noblique rotator seems to be able to explain the long term constancy of \u1e56 trends in 4U 1907+09 and 4U 1626\u221267, the large\nmagnitude of |P/\u1e56|, and the constancy of X-ray flux over the\ntorque reversal, although further and more detailed theoretical\n\n\f10\n\nS. Fritz et al.: Torque reversal of 4U 1907+09\n\nstudies are required. As a prediction of the model for systems\nsuch as 4U 1907+09 and 4U 1626\u221267 is that torque reversal\nepisodes are rare events, further monitoring of the pulse period\nof 4U 1907+09 is required to determine whether this change\nis a sign of a long term torque reversal or whether we are just\nobserving a short deviation from a long term spin down trend.\nAcknowledgements.
