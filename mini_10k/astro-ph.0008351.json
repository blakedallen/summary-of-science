We explore the modest\neffects of the photospheric EUV continua on the wind, as well as the much\nstronger effects of the short-wavelength EUV and soft X-ray emission\nlines.

All of this\nanalysis is presented in the context of a two component stellar wind\u2013\na dense component (clumps) that contains most of the mass but fills a\nnegligible fraction of the volume, and a rarefied component that fills most\nof the volume but accounts for only a small fraction of the mass.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe primary differences between the winds of B stars and those of O stars\nare the much lower densities of B star winds and the relative importance of\nEUV/X-ray emission in B stars. In this paper we will examine the ionization\nand temperature structure of B star winds, with a focus on the EUV and Xray emission properties of these objects. We will see how the differences in\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDavid H. Cohen\n\nthe wind and EUV/X-ray properties cause strong departures from the thermal\nand ionization conditions found in the more well-studied and well-understood O\nstars. The ionization balance in B star winds is both more complex, and harder\nto determine, both theoretically and observationally, than in O star winds. In\nfact, because of the more uncertain ionization corrections to the UV mass-loss\nrates the actual mass-loss rates of B stars are not well known.\nIn addition to this crucial difference between the high wind densities of O\nstars and the low wind densities of B stars, the relative proximity of the nearest\nB stars provides us with some important information that does not exist for\nO stars. Due to the very low column densities toward \u01eb CMa and \u03b2 CMa,\nwe have information about the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission properties\u2013\nboth of the photosphere and of the wind\u2013of these two objects, while we have\nno comparable information about O stars. As we shall see, this EUV emission\nplays an important role in the setting the ionization conditions (and possibly\nthe thermal conditions) in the low-density B star winds.\nThe dense winds of O stars give rise to ultraviolet absorption lines that\nshow both P Cygni emission peaks and broad absorption troughs. However, in\nB stars the winds are not strong enough to generate emission components, and\nthe observed blue-shifted absorption components are seen to be quite weak in the\nfew ions that are observable in the spacecraft ultraviolet. Grigsby & Morrison\n(1995) have shown that UV wind features (at least in those ions accessible to\nIUE) do not exist beyond about B2.\nIn principle, radiation-driven winds can exist if there is at least one optically thick line in the wind. Gayley (1995) has developed a new formalism for\ndescribing the radiation force in standard line-driven winds (Castor, Abbott, &\nKlein 1975; hereafter CAK). He has shown that the line opacity in a stellar wind\nhas the remarkably simple character that its opacity is Q\u0304 \u2248 2000 times stronger\nthan free electron scattering. This includes the effects of elemental abundances\nand assumes a matching between the wavelengths at which the line opacity\nexists and those at which the photospheric spectrum is strongest. Therefore,\nstars with Eddington factors \u0393 > 10\u22123 have the potential for line-driven winds.\nHowever, Puls (2000) has recently shown that for B stars, the opacity and photospheric flux may not be well matched, making it harder for B stars to drive a\nstrong outflow. In any case, this \u0393 > 10\u22123 limit corresponds to stars that have\nsomewhat later spectral types than the B2 limit seen in the UV wind lines. The\ndisappearance of these spectral wind features may, however, be due to ionization\neffects, rather than the disappearance of winds altogether. As we have already\npointed out, determining the mass-loss rates of B stars is very difficult because\nthe ionization corrections to UV absorption line observations is so uncertain,\nand no other reliable mass-loss diagnostics exist for most of these stars.\nDespite the findings of Grigsby and Morrison (1995), there is, in fact, some\nevidence for winds in mid- to late-B, and even early-A, stars. Much of the\nevidence is indirect and centers on the X-ray emission (which we will discuss in\n\u00a73), but one intriguing piece of more direct evidence involves the detection of a\nblue-shifted absorption component in the Lyman-\u03b1 line of the A0 V star Sirius\n(Bertin et al. 1995). This feature is consistent with a wind having a terminal\n.\nvelocity of v\u221e \u2248 100 km s\u22121 and a mass-loss rate of M \u2248 10\u221212 M\u2299 yr \u22121 . So,\n\n\fStructure of B Star Winds\n\n3\n\nit seems that at least some stars with \u0393 < 10\u22123 have winds, although they may\nnot be driven (primarily) by radiation pressure acting on lines.\nIn the remainder of this paper we discuss some results from large surveys\nbut concentrate on detailed observations of the B2 II MK standard \u01eb CMa. With\na wind-broadened (vedge \u2248 800 km s\u22121 ), but weak, C IV 1548, 1551 \u00c5 profile\n.\nand a mass-loss rate of M \u2248 1 to 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 M\u2299 yr \u22121 (Cassinelli et al. 1995;\nCohen et al. 1999) this star has a much lower density wind than O stars, but,\nunlike some later B stars, the existence of its wind is not in doubt. We note\nthat with \u0393 \u2248 0.01 the multiplier factor of Q\u0304 \u2248 2000 implies that the force from\nspectral lines exceeds gravity at the star's surface. This star has Teff = 21000 K\nand LX /LBol = 10\u22127 . It is very well studied and, most importantly, is the only\nhot star observable with all three of the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE)\nspectrometers. This unique data set alone argues for concentrating on \u01eb CMa\nwhen trying to understand radiation-driven winds in B stars.\n2.\n\nPhotospheric EUV Emission from B Stars and its Effect on the\nWind\n\nDirect measurements of stellar photospheric continua below the Lyman edge\nat 912 \u00c5 were impossible until the early 1990s when the EUVE satellite was\nlaunched. Even with this instrument, only a small number of stars could be observed, due to a combination of low intrinsic fluxes and high interstellar opacity.\nOf these stars (aside from white dwarfs), all of the observations are of coronal emission lines from late-type stars, except for two stars: \u01eb CMa and \u03b2 CMa.\nThese are the only two stars for which there are direct measurements of the photospheric flux below the Lyman edge. This is due primarily to their fortuitous\nposition in a tunnel of very low interstellar column density.\nIn general, any study that has required the photospheric EUV fluxes of\nhot stars\u2013including studies of the warm ionized component of the interstellar\nmedium as well as studies of stellar wind conditions\u2013has relied on model atmospheres. There are also a very small number of indirect observations of EUV\nfluxes of B stars. One of these involves Fabry-Perot spectroscopy of H\u03b1 fluxes of\nsmall H II regions around B stars. Assuming that all stellar Lyman continuum\nradiation is reprocessed into H\u03b1 in these H II regions, Kutyrev, Reynolds, &\nTufte (1993) and Reynolds (1995) placed lower limits to the stellar Lyman continuum fluxes that in some cases exceed the predictions of model atmospheres.\nThe direct measurements of the Lyman continuum fluxes of \u01eb CMa and\n\u03b2 CMa (B1 III) with EUVE revealed fluxes that are 10 to 100 times higher\nthan the predictions of model atmospheres (Vallerga, Vedder, & Welsh 1993;\nCassinelli et al. 1995; Cassinelli et al. 1996). The discrepancy seems to be even\nhigher in the He I continuum (\u03bb < 504 \u00c5), which is observed in \u01eb CMa but not\n\u03b2 CMa, although the correction for interstellar attenuation is more uncertain at\nthese wavelengths. Non-LTE, line-blanketed TLUSTY models (Hubeny & Lanz\n1995) actually provide worse fits to the data, as the additional physical effects\ntend to both cool the outer wind, and lead to an overpopulation of the ground\nstate with respect to LTE. Both these effects lower the Lyman continuum flux.\nCassinelli et al. (1995; 1996) suggest that whatever the physical mechanism, the EUV excesses and the observed IR excesses can both be accounted for\n\n\f4\n\nDavid H. Cohen\n\nby a modest increase in the temperature with respect to models in the extreme\nouter layers of the atmosphere (\u03c4Ross \u2248 0.01), perhaps of 1000 to 2000 K. The\nIR continuum is dominated by free-free opacity, and as such, is in LTE. Furthermore, the IR continuum near 15 \u03bcm is formed in the same physical layers as the\nEUV continuum near 600 \u00c5. The 1000 K to 2000 K temperature increase that\ncan explain the observed Lyman continuum excess in \u01eb CMa and \u03b2 CMa can\nalso explain the roughly 10% IR excess observed with IRAS. Although non-LTE\neffects could in principle explain the observed EUV excess, only the existence\nof a temperature above the predictions of models high in the atmosphere can\nsimultaneously explain the EUV and IR excesses.\nIt is not clear how representative these two stars are, or how large the region\nof the HR diagram is for which B star EUV fluxes have been underestimated.\nHowever, the indirect evidence of H II region with high H\u03b1 fluxes indicates that\nthese stars are not unique. To investigate the influence of the photospheric\nEUV flux levels of B stars on the wind ionization, we have calculated non-LTE\nionization equilibrium models for the wind of \u01eb CMa using both the observed\nspectral energy distribution, with its high EUV flux, and a spectrum consistent\nwith non-LTE models, with its much lower EUV flux. These calculations are\nidentical to the ones described in MacFarlane, Cohen, & Wang (1994), where the\nauthors used a version of the NLTERT code (MacFarlane 1997) that accounts\nfor spherical expansion. In this code, rate equations for multi-level atoms are\nsolved self-consistently with the radiation field. We show a comparison in Figure\n1 of the helium and carbon ionization balance as a function of radius for the two\ndifferent cases. The effect of the factor of 100 higher EUV flux is not major,\nbut is nonetheless significant. In both cases, He+ and C+2 dominate, but the\nhigher photospheric flux changes the second most abundant ionization state to\nthe one above the dominant stage from the one below it. This does not change\nthe bulk properties of the wind, but it can have a strong impact on the strengths\nof the observed UV resonance lines. Specifically, note that the mass-loss rate\ndetermined from the C IV 1548, 1551 \u00c5 doublet will be roughly a factor of 20\nhigher if the ionization correction fails to account for X-ray photoionization.\nThe effect of the higher EUV fluxes in B stars on the wind temperature has\nyet to be explored. However, it is clear that the hydrogen ionization rate will\nbe strongly increased by the higher fluxes, and photoionization is the primary\nheating mechanism in OB star winds (see Drew 1989).\n\n3.\n\nX-ray and Short-Wavelength Emission from B Stars and its Effect\non the Wind\n\nThe short-wavelength EUV (40 eV <\n\u223c h\u03bd < 100 eV) and soft X-ray line emission\nfrom early-B stars is usually understood in the context of the wind-shock emission that is assumed to operate in O stars. The X-ray emission from mid- and\nlate-B stars is harder to understand in terms of the standard picture of wind\nshocks, however. Much of the information we have about the X-ray properties\nof B stars comes from large low-resolution surveys with ROSAT and Einstein,\nbut a significant amount of complementary information has been obtained from\nhigher resolution observations of a small number of B stars, including \u01eb CMa.\n\n\f5\n\nStructure of B Star Winds\n\n1\n\n1\n+\n\n+2\n\nHe\n\nC\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nionization fraction\n\nionization fraction\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n+\n\nC\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n+3\n\no\n\nC\n\nHe\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\nradius (Rstar)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nradius (Rstar)\n\n1\n\n1\n+\n\nHe\n\n+2\n\nC\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nionization fraction\n\nionization fraction\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n+2\n\nHe\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n+3\n\nC\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n+\n\nC\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nradius (Rstar)\n\n15\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nradius (Rstar)\n\nFigure 1.\nIonization balance for helium (left) and carbon (right) with\ntwo different photospheric flux levels: the observed high levels (bottom)\nand the predicted lower levels (top).\n\n\f6\n\nDavid H. Cohen\n\nFigure 2.\nThe EUVE spectrum of \u01eb CMa. Note the photospheric\ncontinuum at the longer wavelengths, as well as low ionization emission\nlines (He II and O III) and high ionization lines of various stages of iron.\nThe surveys have indicated that the LX /LBol \u2248 10\u22127 relation that holds for\nO stars extends to about B1 but then breaks down, with LX decreasing faster\nthan LBol beyond this spectral subtype (Cohen, Cassinelli, & MacFarlane 1997).\nThe breakdown in the LX /LBol law occurs just at the point where hot star winds\nare becoming optically thin to X-rays, as discussed by Owocki & Cohen (1999),\n. 2\n\n3.4 .\nwho show that the X-ray luminosity is expected to scale as LX \u223c M \u223c LBol\nHowever, the slope in the LX /LBol relationship is not observed to be this steep,\nimplying that the X-ray filling factors in mid-B stars approach, and in some\ncases exceed, unity (Cohen et al. 1997). There are several possible implications\nto these surprising data: (1) the X-ray emitting gas is clumped to enhance the\nemission measure for a given total mass; (2) the mass-loss rates of these B stars\nare actually higher than Abbott's (1982) CAK parameters imply; or (3) the\nX-rays do not arise (entirely) in the wind. Note that this filling-factor problem\nis not as significant an issue for very early B stars and early-B stars lying above\nthe main sequence, like \u01eb CMa, which exhibits an emission measure filling factor\nof roughly 0.1 (Cohen et al. 1996).\nThe EUVE spectrometers have access not only to photospheric radiation\nin the so-called \"long-wavelength\" spectrometer (300 \u00c5<\n\u223c \u03bb <\n\u223c 760 \u00c5), but\nalso to line emission in the short- and medium-wavelength spectrometers (70\n\u00c5 < \u03bb < 370 \u00c5). For \u01eb CMa, five highly ionized iron lines are detected in the\nEUVE data with greater than 4\u03c3 significance. These lines, along with emission\nlines formed in the photoionized cool component of the stellar wind and the\nHe I photospheric continuum, are shown in Figure 2. These iron lines have a\ncombined emergent luminosity on par with the total X-ray luminosity observed\nwith ROSAT, and significantly more intrinsic luminosity (the difference being\n\n\f7\n\nStructure of B Star Winds\n1\n\n1\n+\n\nHe\n\n+2\n\nC\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nionization fraction\n\nionization fraction\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n+2\n\nHe\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n+3\n\nC\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n+\n\nC\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n0\n\n5\n\nradius (Rstar)\n\n10\n\n15\n\nradius (Rstar)\n+4\n\n1\n\nC\n\n1\n+2\n\nHe\n\n+3\n\nC\n-1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nionization fraction\n\nionization fraction\n\n10\n\n+\n\nHe\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n+2\n\nC\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n+\n\nC\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nradius (Rstar)\n\n15\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nradius (Rstar)\n\nFigure 3.\nIonization balance for helium (left) and carbon (right) with\nX-rays (bottom) and without X-rays (top).\nthe result of continuum opacity in the wind). They can be fit simultaneously\nwith the ROSAT data to derive a temperature distribution of the hot plasma\non \u01eb CMa. The results of this modeling indicate that there is significantly more\nplasma with temperatures at or below 106 K than plasma with temperatures\nnear 5 \u00d7 106 K (Cohen et al. 1996). This result is consistent with the ROSAT\ndata for other B stars (Cohen et al. 1997). The analysis of the combined EUVE\nand ROSAT data also indicates that the wind is somewhat optically thick at\nvery soft X-ray energies, and quite optically thick at EUV energies. The amount\nof attenuation derived from these data indicates that the hot plasma on \u01eb CMa\nis spatially distributed throughout the wind (Cohen et al. 1996).\nThe information about the temperature distribution of the X-ray emitting\nplasma on \u01eb CMa, as well as the wind absorption, allow us to generate and\nconstrain models of the wind ionization state of the bulk, unshocked wind. In\nmuch the same way we compared ionization state models for different values of\nthe photospheric EUV flux, let us now examine the effect of X-rays on the wind\nionization. Using an input photospheric spectrum for which we have adjusted\nthe EUV continuum flux to match the \u01eb CMa data, we calculated a model with\nan X-ray source distributed throughout the wind and compared it to the model\nwith no X-rays. In Figure 3 we show the results of this comparison for helium\nand carbon. It can immediately be seen that the X-rays' influence is much\ngreater than the photospheric EUV radiation's. With the X-ray photoionization\nin the calculation, the primary ionization state changes from He+ to He+2 and\n\n\f8\n\nDavid H. Cohen\n\nFigure 4.\nWind-broadened EUV features seen in the ORFEUS-SPAS\nspectrum of \u01eb CMa.\nfrom C+2 to C+4 . There is also a general spreading-out of the ionization stages,\nwith three different stages of carbon each accounting for at least 10% of the\ntotal.\nAn explanation for the strong effect of X-rays in determining the ionization\nstates of B star winds (as opposed to O stars winds in which the photosphere\nsets the ionization rate, and the X-rays cause only a perturbation) has been\noffered by MacFarlane et al. (1994). In the hotter O stars, the photospheric\nradiation field is strong above the He II edge at 228 \u00c5 (54.4 eV) and the Xray field dominates the photosphere only above about 100 eV. By contrast, for\nthe cooler B stars, the X-ray field dominates the much weaker He II continuum\nand even some of the He I continuum, starting at about 40 eV. This causes the\nX-rays to have a stronger effect on the wind ionization in B stars. In fact, the\nX-rays boost the mean ionization state about one full stage on average for B\nstars.\nIndeed, in \u01eb CMa surprisingly high levels of wind ionization are seen in oxygen. Both EUVE and ORFEUS detected wind broadening in the O V 630 \u00c5 line.\nSee Figure 4 for the higher-resolution ORFEUS spectral measurements. Both\nX-rays and a high photospheric EUV flux are necessary to produce significant\namounts of O+4 in the wind of this star.\n\n4.\n\nThe Bowen Mechanism in the Wind of \u01eb CMa\n\nIt should be noted that the attenuation of X-rays in the bulk stellar wind involves\nprimarily very soft X-rays and short-wavelength EUV emission, and that the\nmajority of photoionization involves helium (from singly to fully ionized). The\nionization of helium by the X-rays leads to recombination radiation, primarily\nin the He II Ly\u03b1 line at 304 \u00c5. This line is coincident with an O III line,\nwhich is pumped, leading to a radiative cascade that (usually) culminates in the\nemission of a photon at 374 \u00c5. Until it was seen in \u01eb CMa, this line had never\nbeen detected in an astrophysical object outside the solar system, although the\n\n\f9\n\nStructure of B Star Winds\n\nHe III\n\nHe II\n\nO III\n\nO III\n\ntriplets\n\nsinglets\n\nn=2\nUV\n304 \u00c5\n\nUV\n\nEUV/X-rays\n435 \u00c5\n\n304 \u00c5\n\n394 \u00c5\n\n374 \u00c5\nn=1\n\nFigure 5.\nSchematic energy-level diagram of the Bowen fluorescence\nmechanism. In \u01eb CMa, and likely in other hot stars, the X-rays that\narise in the wind ionized helium, which upon recombination populates\nthe He+ n = 2 state, which leads to Ly\u03b1 emission at 304 \u00c5. This excites\nan O III transition out of the ground state. The subsequent cascade\nproduces 374 \u00c5, 394 \u00c5, or 435 \u00c5 emission, with a branching ratio that\nis temperature sensitive.\nnear-UV lines emitted by transitions among the high-lying levels involved in the\nBowen mechanism are often seen in nebulae. In Figure 5 we show an energy\nlevel diagram for the Bowen mechanism in \u01eb CMa.\nCohen et al. (1999) have shown that the 304 \u00c5 and 374 \u00c5 fluxes are\n.\nquite sensitive to the mass-loss rate. They find a value of M \u2248 1 to 2 \u00d7 10\u22128\nM\u2299 yr \u22121 , which is about a factor of three less than the prediction from the CAK\nparameters compiled by Abbott (1982). The 304 \u00c5 line is wind broadened in\nthe EUVE spectrum of \u01eb CMa. The broadening is consistent with a line that is\noptically thick out to velocities of v = 750\u00b1150 km s\u22121 . This is further indication\nthat the X-ray emission is distributed throughout the wind, and furthermore,\nthat it interacts with the bulk wind and causes ionization throughout the wind.\nFinally, it has recently been realized that the Bowen fluorescence can resolve\nvia one of two transitions on the singlet side of O III at 394 \u00c5 and 435 \u00c5, in\naddition to the 374 \u00c5 triplet (Cohen et al. 1999). The relative strength of the\nsinglet and triplet lines is sensitive ultimately to the wind temperature, and\nso these lines may prove to be the most quantitative and direct temperature\ndiagnostic of any hot star wind.\n5.\n\nUpcoming X-ray Spectroscopy Missions\n\nAn entirely new era of astrophysical X-ray spectroscopy is imminent with the\nrecent launches of Chandra and XMM. The spectral diagnostics that will soon\nbecome available will allow for the determination of the density, velocity, and\ntemperature of the hot regions in the winds of B stars, and other hot stars.\nWe will be able to answer questions such as: Are the shocked regions denser\n\n\f10\n\nDavid H. Cohen\n\nFigure 6.\nThe ASCA spectrum of Vela X-1 shows emission lines that\narise from recombination in the low-density component of the wind\ndominate the spectrum. However, several features from the cold, dense\nwind component are seen. These are the radiative recombination continua (RRC) and several fluorescent lines that are blended with emission features from highly ionized states of the same elements.\nthan the ambient wind? And what is the ionization distribution in the denser\nstructures in B star winds?\nIn order to demonstrate the types of analysis that will be possible with\nthese new data\u2013and also to explore directly the clumping properties of B star\nwinds\u2013we briefly discuss some new interpretations of recent medium-resolution\nASCA spectra of the X-ray binary, Vela X-1, which contains a B0.5 I star as the\nmass-losing companion. The accretion of the B star's wind onto the compact\ncompanion produces hard X-rays, which are reprocessed in the wind. When\nviewed during eclipse, virtually all of the radiation is coming from the B star's\nwind, primarily via recombination in the highly (photo-)ionized portion of the\nwind and via X-ray fluorescence in the less ionized, denser portion of the wind.\nRecently, Sako et al. (1999) have identified these two different spectral\ncomponents in the ASCA data (see Figure 6). Much more quantitative analysis\nwill be possible with the higher resolution spectra that become available over\nthe next few years. However, Sako et al. (1999) extract a significant amount of\ninformation from this marginal spectrum. They fit a mass-loss rate and velocity\n\u03b2 parameter for the B star's wind, based on observations of the highly ionized\nrecombination lines which are formed in the hot, low density component. They\nalso derive the overall mass in the cool dense component and put some constraints on its density from the observations of the X-ray fluorescence lines. The\nresults of the analysis show the highly ionized low density component accounts\nfor less than 10% of the mass, but occupies 95% of the volume. Conversely, the\ncold, dense clumps occupy less than 5% of the volume but represent about 90%\nof the mass of the wind.\nIt is notable that this type of wind structure is similar to that seen in\nnumerical simulations of the line-force instability (Owocki, Castor, & Rybicki\n\n\fStructure of B Star Winds\n\n11\n\n1988; Feldmeier 1995; Feldmeier, Puls, & Pauldrach 1997; Owocki, Runacres,\n& Cohen, these proc.). Furthermore, to maintain clumping structure far out\nin the wind flow, over-dense and under-dense regions must be close to pressure equilibrium. The \"ambient\" wind (the mass-weighted mean wind, which is\ndominated by the dense clumps) has a temperature somewhat below the stellar\neffective temperature (T \u223c 104 K) and the X-ray emitting component has a\ntypical temperature of T \u223c 106 K. Pressure equilibrium therefore requires the\nhot component to be of order 100 times less dense than the cool component.\nUsing the numbers from the ASCA observations of Vela X-1, the clumps are 20\ntimes denser than the mean wind1 , while the hot, low-density component is 10\ntimes less dense. So the density contrast between the two components is 200.\nOwocki & Cohen (1999) have introduced a simple empirical model for X-ray\ntransfer through a two-component wind in an effort to explain the LX /LBol \u223c\n10\u22127 law. The total X-ray flux generated scales as the observed emission measure,\nLX \u223c (E.M.)\u039b\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u039b is a function of atomic parameters and of the ionization distribution in\nthe emitting plasma, and the emission measure is given by\nE.M. =\n\nZ\n\nne ni dV.\n\n(2)\n\nHere the volume integral is over regions with plasma at X-ray emitting temper5\natures (T >\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 ). Owocki & Cohen (1999) scale this to the \"whole wind\"\nemission measure, as\nE.M. = Cs fm (E.M.wind ) = Cs fm\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nne ni 4\u03c0r 2 dr\n\n(3)\n\nRmin\n\nwhere the mass filling factor, fm , is the fraction of the mass of the wind (above\nsome appropriate minimum radius) that is heated to X-ray emitting temperatures, and Cs = \u03c1s /\u03c1\u0304 is the typical density in the post-shock region compared\nto the local value of the density in the idealized smooth, mean wind. Note that\neach of these factors can be thought of as scaling one of the density terms inside\nthe volume integral.\nThe product Cs fm is the normalization factor\u2013essentially the emission measure filling factor\u2013and the terms cannot be separated using low-resolution data;\nbut using spectroscopic techniques, enough information can be determined about\nboth components of the wind to separate them. For the B star in Vela X-1,\nfm \u2248 0.1, and Cs \u2248 0.1. This normalization factor Cs fm \u2248 0.01 is consistent\nwith the ROSAT observations of O stars, and the B0.5 I component of Vela X-1\nis a supergiant and so has a denser wind that is more like an O star's.\nThus, a consistent picture emerges of hot star winds, in which a pervasive hot, low-density component is in approximate pressure equilibrium with a\ncold, denser component presumably consisting of numerous small clumps. The\n1\n\nIn the two component picture, this \"mean wind\" exists only in a statistical sense.\n\n\f12\n\nDavid H. Cohen\n\nnumbers are roughly consistent with numerical simulations of the line-force instability, perhaps having stochastic perturbations at the base (Feldmeier et al.\n1997) for O and early-B stars. They are also consistent with the overall levels\nof X-ray flux seen in O and early-B stars, as well as with the detailed X-ray\nreprocessing spectrum of Vela X-1, as observed with ASCA (Sako et al. 1999).\nFor the mid- and late-B stars, however, recall that much higher filling factors\n(Cs fm ) are required to match the observations. In these objects, the hot X-ray\nemitting gas must also be dense (i.e. Cs > 1) to prevent fm > 1. It is possible,\nfor example, that magnetic loops confine a radiation-driven wind in some of\nthese stars, forcing different flows to collide at high velocities, and containing the\nresulting hot gas, which preserves its relatively high density (Babel & Montmerle\n1997). High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy will be able to provide density and\ntemperature diagnostics of the emitting plasma in these stars, which will reveal\nwhether the hot material in these winds exists in the dense phase.\n\n6.\n\nSummary\n\nThe X-ray and EUV properties of B stars are significant, and have a controlling\neffect on the ionization conditions in the wind. With the improved understanding of these properties and their effects, additional modeling of the temperature\nstructure in OB star winds is warranted. The stronger than expected photospheric EUV continua provide a small but important increase to the overall\nionization conditions in the winds of B stars, but the X-ray and especially the\nshort-wavelength EUV emission lines play the dominant role. The ionization\nbalance is changed completely by X-ray photoionization. Furthermore, the Xrays (h\u03bd > 100 eV) that are seen by instruments like ROSAT represent just a\nsmall fraction of the photons emitted by the hot plasma in the winds of B stars,\nwhich are predominantly EUV photons.\nFinally, the interaction of this EUV/X-ray emission with the cooler, denser\nwind component involves a complex reprocessing of the absorbed X-ray photons\ninto UV and EUV emission lines via the Bowen fluorescence mechanism. More\nand more, the detailed spectral information that is becoming available will drive\nour understanding of the structure of hot star winds, including those of B stars.\nThe picture that has started to emerge is one of a clumped, two-component\nmedium, in which most of the bulk properties of the wind are defined by the\ndense clumps\u2013in a sense, these clumps are the wind\u2013but most of the volume is\nfilled by a much lower density component.\nThe information we have covered leads us to identify the following questions\nwhich still need to be addressed: What role does clumping play in B star winds,\nand how do clumps originate and evolve? How does X-ray induced ionization\nfeed back into the line force, wind dynamics, and mass-loss rate? How are\nthermal conditions affected by the high photospheric EUV fluxes? And what is\nthe nature of winds for stars later than about B2?\nAcknowledgments. We thank Mark Runacres for his careful reading of the\nmanuscript.
