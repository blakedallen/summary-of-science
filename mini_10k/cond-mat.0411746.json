Recently,\nmuch attention has been directed to the study of magnetic solid films. To understand, theoretically, the effect\nof surface on wetting and layering transitions in these systems, we will give in this chapter a presentation of\nseveral relevant recent theoretical works realized on wetting and layering transitions in which we explain how\nthe nature of surface can affect the behavior of wetting and layering transitions. Using different spin systems\nmodels and different numerical and approximate methods such as mean field and effective field theories, real\nspace renormalization group technique, transfer matrix method and Monte-Carlo simulations, it is found that\nthe wetting and layering transitions depend on the nature of the surface magnetic field, the surface coupling\nstrength, the surface crystal field, the geometry of surface, the in-homogeneity of substrate and the quantum\nfluctuations at the surface. Indeed the layering transition temperature increases or decreases as a function of\nthe thickness of the film depending on which the surface coupling is smaller or greater than a critical value.\nThus the wetting transition temperature can be greater or smaller than the layering temperature. In the case\nof variable surface crystal field an order-disorder layering reentrance appears with new critical exponents\nand multi-critical behaviors. Wetting phenomena is also influenced by the curvature of the surface. In\nfact the intra-layers transitions appear under the effect of edge on the surface and/or corrugated surface.\nHowever, there exist an intra-layering surface temperature above which the surface and the intra-layer surface\ntransitions occur . While the bulk layering and intra-layering transitions above an other finite temperature\nwhich is greater than the former one. Such behavior is not seen in the case of a perfect surface. Beside\nthis and under the corrugation effect , the pre-wetting phenomena and layering transitions occur at zero\ntemperature, even in the case of a uniform magnetic field. In this case the wetting temperature depends\nstrongly on the width of the corrugated-steps but weakly on its number. The quantum fluctuations introduce\na new wetting transitions, namely the wetting, layering and roughening transverse fields. These fluctuations\nlead to the appearance of a sequence of layering sublimations transitions which occur before bulk melting\nabove a critical transverse field which depends on temperature and/or chemical potential. Moreover, the\nwetting temperature depends strongly on the randomness of the quantum fluctuations. The chapter is\norganized as follows: Section 1 is reserved to the Introduction and definitions.

[1], Pandit and Wortis [2], Nightingale et al. [3] and Ebner et al. [4-7]. A variation of\nphase diagrams with the strength of the substrate potential in lattice gas model for multilayer adsorption has\nbeen studied by Patrykiejew et al. [8] using Monte Carlo simulations and molecular field approximation. One\ntype of transitions is the layering transitions, in which the thickness of a solid film increases discontinuously by\none layer as the pressure is increased. Such transitions have been observed in a variety of systems including for\nexample 4 He [9,10] and ethylene [11,12] adsorbed on graphite.\nMany experiments works have for subject the study of wetting transitions. However, the effect of substrate\nroughness on wetting has been studied [13,14] and the thickness profile of the drop of a nematic liquid crystal\non a rough surface [15]. The effect of the nature of the adsorbate has been studied by several authors namely\n[16] the critical wetting of pentane on water. the critical adsorption and the layering transitions, at the free\nsurface, of a smectic liquid crystal [17], the effect of segregation on wetting in films of a partially miscible polymer\nblend[18], the effect of the chain length of alkanes on water [19], the critical adsorption and dimensional crossover\nin epitaxial FeCo films [20], the heterogeneous hole nucleation in electron-charged 4 He wetting films [21], the\nexistence of tricritical wetting in liquid mixtures of methanol and the n-alkanes [22], the microscopic structure of\nthe wetting film at the surface of liquid Ga-Bi alloys [23], the tetra point wetting at the free surface of liquid GaBi, in which a continuous surface wetting transition, pinned to a solid-liquid-liquid-vapor tetra coexistence point\noccurs [24], the short range wetting at liquid (Ga-Bi) alloy surfaces [25], the critical Casimir effect and wetting by\nHelium mixtures [26]. The dynamic aspect has been studied by several authors; namely, the dynamic properties\nof a fluid interface of nanometric curvature formed by capillary condensation between solid substrates [27], the\ndynamic of wetting layer [28], and the dynamic of layering transition in confined liquids [29]. The nature of the\ntransitions has attracted attention like; the wetting near the triple point [30], and the sequence of two wetting\ntransitions induced by tuning the Hamaker constant [31]. However, a simple lattice gas model with layering\ntransitions and critical points has been introduced and studied in the mean field approximation by de Oliveira\nand Griffiths [32]. These experimental studies have motivated many theoretical works. However several methods\nhave been used to study wetting and layering transitions. The transfer matrix and scaling theory have been\nused to study the curvature controlled wetting in two dimensions [33], the adsorption of polyelectrolytes at an\noppositely charged surface [34]. Using Monte Carlo simulations the effects of van der Waals surface interactions\non wetting transitions in polymer blends [35], the wetting properties of neon on heterogeneous surfaces [36],\nthe wetting transitions of hydrogen and deuterium on the surface of alkali [37], the multilayer adsorption of\nbinary mixtures [38], the competition between short-ranged attractions and long-ranged repulsions in systems\nlike langmuir monolayers, magnetic films, and adsorbed monolayers using numerical simulations and analytic\ntheory [39], the double wedge wetting [40], and the wetting behavior of associating binary mixtures at attractive\nwalls [41]. The variational and mean field approximation have been used to investigate many interest problems\nsuch as; the dewetting, partial wetting and spreading of a two-dimensional monolayer on solid surface [42], the\n\n4\n\n\fline tension between fluid phases and a substrate [43], the effect of confinement and surface enhancement on\nsuperconductivity [44], the symmetric polymer blend confined into a film with antisymmetric surfaces [45], the\nwetting of potassium surfaces by superfluid 4 He [46], the filling transition for edge [47], the wetting of film on\nchemically heterogeneous substrates [48], the wetting and the interaction potential between spherical particles\n[49], the phase diagram for morphological transitions of wetting films on chemically structured substrates [50],\nthe phase behavior of colloidal binary hard-platelet and hard-rod fluids [51], the influence of random self-affine\nand mound substrate roughness on the wetting of adsorbed van der Waals films [52], the wetting of van der Waals\nsolid films on self-affine rough surfaces [53], the preroughening and reentrant layering transitions on triangular\nlattice substrates [54], the layering transitions, disordered flat phases, reconstruction, and roughening of a semiinfinite crystal [55]. Other method have been used to study wetting phenomena such as; the renormalization\ngroup of the capillary parameter at complete wetting [56], the surface deconstruction and roughening in the\nmultiziggurat model of wetting [57], the morphological transitions of wetting layers on structured surfaces\n[58], the limiting height at which a solid can approach an air-water surface without becoming wet [59], the\nsurface roughness and hydrodynamic boundary slip of a newtonian fluid in completely wetting system [60],\nthe modeling at low temperature of a 4 He film adsorbed on a Li substrate [61] and the prewetting of 4 He\non rubidium [62], the critical adsorption on defects in Ising magnets and binary alloys [63], the exact study\nof edge filling transition for Ising corners [64], the wetting hysteresis at the molecular scale [65], the wetting\ntransition in a two-dimensional Ising model with a free rough surface [66]. Ebner and Saam [67] carried out\nMonte Carlo simulations of such a lattice gas model. Huse [68] applied renormalizaion group technique to this\nmodel. It allowed the study of the effects on an atomic scale or order disorder transitions in the adsorbed layers,\nwhich may have considerable influence on the layering transitions and tracing back macroscopic phenomena on\ninter-atomic potentials. Benyoussef and Ez-Zahraouy have studied the layering transitions of Ising model thin\nfilms using a real space renormalization group [69], and transfer matrix methods [70]. Using the mean field\ntheory, Hong [71], have found that depending on the values of the exchange integrals near the surface region,\nthe film critical temperature may be lower, higher than, or equal to that of the bulk.\nOn the other hand, the development of molecular-beam epitaxy has allowed the fabrication of high quality\nthin films [72]. Among them, the magnetic film consisting on a few atomic layers is of particular importance,\nas it has been used as a convenient model for theoretical and experimental analysis of a variety of magnetic\nphenomena. One other problem investigated is the critical temperature at which the system undergoes a\nmagnetic-nonmagnetic phase transition. Of particular interest is the change of this temperature when the\nmagnetic system becomes finite in a given direction.\nBriefly, depending on the values of magnetic coupling constants near the surface region, two different behaviors at the surface can be demonstrated [71]: (i) the surface critical temperature is the same as of the bulk one\nwhen the coupling constant on the surface is smaller than a critical value \"ordinary transition\". (ii) The surface\ncritical temperature may be higher than the corresponding bulk one when the surface coupling is larger than\nthe critical value \"extraordinary transition\". At the critical ratio, one encounters the \"special transition point\",\nwith critical properties of the surface transition deviating from those at the ordinary or the distinct surface\ntransition. As for the film system, which is finite in one direction, it has been established that its magnetic\n\n5\n\n\fproperties can differ greatly from those of the corresponding bulk [73-77]. Experimental results [78] showed that\nthe critical temperature of a vanadium film depends on the film thickness and its critical behavior is like that\nof the two-dimensional system rather than that of the three-dimensional bulk.\nSince the theory of surface critical phenomena started developing, much attention has been devoted to\nthe study of the Blume Capel (BC) model over semi-infinite lattices, with modified surface couplings. Phase\ndiagrams in the mean field approximation reporting four possible topologies at fixed bulk/surface coupling ratios\nhave been determined [79-83]. An analogous analysis have also been done using a real space renormalization\ngroup transformation [84]. Some other works referring to particular regions of the phase space are, for example,\nthose using: the mean field approximation [85], the effective field approximation [86] and the low temperature\nexpansion [87]. These works show that it is possible to have a phase with ordered surface and disordered bulk,\nwhich is separated from the completely ordered phase by the so-called extraordinary transition and from the\ncompletely disordered phase by the surface transition. In the absence of this phase, the transition between the\ncompletely ordered and the completely disordered phase is called ordinary. These three kinds of phase transitions\nhave a meeting point named special which is generally a multi-critical point. The discussion presented in Ref.\n[88] shows that the strong interest in these models arises partly from the unusually rich phase transition behavior\nthey display as their interaction parameters are varied, and partly from their many possible applications. The\nbilinear interaction considered in most of these cases is ferromagnetic. The spin-1 Ising systems are used to\ndescribe both the order-disorder transition and the crystallization of the binary allow, and it was solved for\nthe anti-ferromagnetic case in the mean field approach [89]. The decomposition of a line of tri-critical points\ninto a line of critical end points and one of double critical points is one of the most interesting features of the\nmean field phase diagram for the anti-ferromagnetic spin-1 Blume-Capel model in an external magnetic field\n[90]. The transfer-matrix and Monte Carlo finite-size-scaling methods [91], are also applied to study this model\nbut such decomposition does not occur in the two dimensional case. The finite cluster approximation has been\napplied by Benyoussef et al. [92] in order to study the spin-1 Ising model with a random crystal field. On the\nother hand, the transverse field or crystal field effects of spin-1 Ising model has been studied by several authors\n[93-96].\nThe experimental measurements of layer-by-layer ordering phenomena have been established on free-standing\nliquid crystals films such as nmOBC (n \u2212 alkyl \u2212 4\u2032 \u2212 n \u2212 alkyloxybiphenyl \u2212 4 \u2212 carboxylate) [97,98] and\n54COOBC ( n-pentyl-4'-n-pentanoyloxy-biphenyl-4-carboxylate) [99] for several molecular layers. More recently, Lin el al. [100] have used the three-level Potts model to show the existence of layer-by-layer ordering\nof ultra thin liquid crystal films of free-standing 54COOBC films, by adjusting the interlayer and intra layer\ncouplings between nearest- neighboring molecules.\nDepending on the value of the crystal field at the surface some systems undergo a phase transition from a\ncompletely disordered state, at high temperatures, to a state with the first k layers disordered and the rest of\nthe layers ordered at low very temperatures. One can then observe a particular behavior when the transition to\nthe order state of the k th layer occurs not only with the decrease but also with the increase of the temperature.\nSuch phase transitions are called the reentrant phenomena.\nThe reentrant first-order layering transitions have been observed experimentally in multilayer argon films\n\n6\n\n\fon graphite by Youn and Hess [101]. Interesting results were obtained within MFA such [102] as order-disorder\nlayering transitions and reentrant phenomena. But it is well known that the MFA approximation does not take\ninto account the thermal fluctuations and neglects correlations between spins. This can lead to incorrect results.\nThe Blume-Capel model (BC) was originally proposed to study the first-order magnetic phase transitions\nin spin\u22121 Ising systems [103]. This model was generalized to the Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) to study\nphase separation and superfluity in 3 He-4 He mixtures [104]. Later it has been applied to describe properties\nof multicomponent fluids [105], semiconductor alloys [106] and electronic conduction models [107]. The (BC)\nmodel is not exactly solvable in more than one dimension, but it has been studied over infinite d-dimensional\nlattices by means of many different approximate techniques and its phase diagram is well known.\nOn the other hand, ferroelectric films can be described by an Ising model and when the film becomes\nvery thick, its properties are those of the semi-infinite Ising system [108-110]. From the experimental point\nof view, the most commonly studied magnetic multilayers are those of ferromagnetic transition metal such as\nFe/Ni, where the coupling can exist between magnetic layers [111-113]. The discovery of enormous values of\nmagnetoresistance in magnetic multilayers are far exceeding those found in single layer films and so exceeds\nthe discovery of oscillatory interlayer coupling in transition metal multilayers. These experimental studies have\nmotivated much theoretical works to study magnetic thin films as well as critical phenomena [114-117]. This\nis partly motivated by the development of new growth and characterization techniques, but perhaps more so\nby the discovery of many exciting new properties, some quite unanticipated. The effect of the surface and\nbulk transverse fields on the phase diagrams of a semi infinite spin-1 ferromagnetic Ising model with a crystal\nfield was investigated [118-119] within a finite cluster approximation with an expansion technique for cluster\nidentities of spin-1 localized spin systems.\nSubstantial research efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of quantum-dot structures, due to the interesting electronic and optical properties that can result from quantum confinement. Several novel applications\nfor such structures have been envisaged such as the single-electron transistor and intersubband quantum-dot\ninfrared photodetectors. The well studied technique of creating quantum dots is the use of Si deposition on\nGe [120,121]. A significant number of studies have been performed with the aim of understanding the structural and compositional evolution of Ge islands growing. The role played by different growth parameters such\nas temperature, pressure and others have been studied for different growth techniques. The evolution of self\nassembled Ge islands in low pressure chemical vapor deposition of Ge on Si, using high growth rates, has been\ninvestigated by atomic force microscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry [122].\nOn the other hand, the understanding of the nature and consequences of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions\nat solid surfaces is of great interest in engineering properties of interfacial materials. Many recent studies show\nthat indirect interactions, mediated by the structure, can be significant enough to influence the formation of\nnano-structures at surfaces [123]. Indeed, much progress has been made recently in understanding adatom-pair\ninteractions mediated by Shockley surface state electrons and the oscillatory interaction decays with adsorbate\nseparation thickness [124-127]. Monte Carlo Simulations [128-130] and subsequently derived mean field theories\n[129,131], showed the existence of higher island densities than those expected by standard nucleation theory. It\nis shown that several experimental works, e.g. [127,132-134], supports these predictions, such as the deposition\n\n7\n\n\fof Au on mica substrates at a high temperature [135-142].\nIn most cases, the electrical conductivity and practical utility of discontinuous metal films, have been extensively explored [143-145]. On the other hand, media that are magnetized perpendicular to the plane of\nthe film, such as ultra thin cobalt films or multi layered structures [146,147], are more stable against thermal self-erasure [144,148] than conventional memory devices. In this context, magneto-optical memories seem\nparticularly promising for ultrahigh-density recording on portable disks. The roughness and mobility of the\nmagnetic domain walls [149,150] prevents closer packing of the magnetic bits, and therefore presents a challenge\nto reaching even higher bit densities. Increasing information storage to high densities may evolve through extensions of current magnetic recording technologies. But such increases in storage density might be achieved\nby using other techniques such as holography, or micro machined nano-cantilever arrays [151]. The bit-writing\nwith local probes may be thermally assisted by a current [152] or a laser beam that raises local temperature to\nthe vicinity of the Curie temperature, resulting in the formation of a reversed domain with a rough wall. On\nthe other hand, a strain implemented by a linear defect, in a magnetic thin film [153], can realize smooth and\nstable domain walls, that can be implemented without nano-scale patterning, Furthermore, composite materials\nsuch as multilayer coatings and isotropic nanocomposite coatings, having structures in the nanometer scale, can\neven show properties, which can not be obtained by a single coating material alone [154]. The most widely used\ncoatings are T iN , T iC, T iCN , and combination thereof, as well as some coatings with lubrificating properties\nsuch as diamond-like carbon. Monte Carlo simulations are applied to study the equilibrium magnetic domain\nstructure of growing ultra thin ferromagnetic films with a realistic atomic structure [155]. Near the percolation\nthreshold a metastable magnetic domain structure is obtained with an average domain area ranging between\nthe area of individual magnetic islands and the area of the large domains observed for thicker ferromagnetic\nfilms. This micro-domain structure is controlled and stabilized by the non-uniform atomic nano-structure of\nthe ultra-thin film, causing a random interaction between magnetic islands with varying sizes and shapes. The\ninvestigation of the magnetic domain formation, in nano-structured ultra-thin films, is an active field of current\nresearch. The influence of the atomic morphology on the magnetic properties is known to be especially strong\nduring the initial states of the thin film growth. A small variation of the preparation conditions may considerably change the obtained magnetic structure. This has been shown, by resolving imaging techniques, which\nallows the investigation of atomic structure as well as the magnetic domain structure of several nanostructured\nsystems [156,160-161]. The influence of the presence of a surface up on the bulk critical behavior has been the\nfocus of scientific interest during the last decade [162-164]. Since the free surface is the natural break of the\ntranslational symmetry in any real system, critical phenomena at perfect surfaces have attracted much interest.\nFurthermore, the phase diagram for the semi-infinite Ising model is well established [162,164]. Moreover, surface\ncritical exponents have been estimated, both theoretically. The general agreement is quite satisfactory [162-164].\nThe critical behavior of magnetic materials with variable strength of coupling on the surface is characterized by\nsurface critical exponents independent of the bulk ones. For their theoretical determination \u01eb-expansion [164],\nseries expansion [165], and Monte-Carlo simulations [166,167] were applied. Moreover, the magnetic properties\ndepend on several geometric features, which depend on the conditions during the growth. thus, the connection\nbetween experimental and theoretical results requires a detailed study of the dependence of physical quantities\n\n8\n\n\fon the geometry of the systems. Some specific properties have already been considered in theoretical works,\nsuch as the size and the lattice structure of small clusters [168,169], the thickness of the film [170] and the\nroughness of one dimensional structures [171], in particular, the role of surface imperfections, unavoidable in\nreal materials, on the critical properties has been studied [172-175]. According to the Harris criterion [176], the\nrelevance of the perturbationis connected to the sign of the specific heat exponent \u03b1 in the pure system. Small\namounts of disorder do not change the nature of the phase transition,if the corresponding pure system's specific\nheat exponent is negative. Currently, there appears to be widespread consensus that critical exponents of bond\ndisordered systems in the weak disorder limit are the same as those of the pure one [177-179]. Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of bond disordered systems show logarithmic corrections in the behavior of the magnetizations\nwhich persist even in the strongly disordered regime [180,181]. However, in the 2D spin diluted Ising model a\ncontinuous variation of critical exponents with the spin density has been found [182]. A Monte-Carlo study [183]\nshows that the specific heat does not diverge at the critical point, at least when the concentration of dilution is\nsufficiently large; the critical behavior of the magnetic susceptibility and the correlation length are consistent\nwith the pure power-law behavior with the concentration dependent critical exponents. Moreover , using Monte\nCarlo simulations, the site-diluted Ising model in two dimensions has been studied [184] where it is found that\nsuch model belongs to the same universality class as the pure one, in spite of the strong logarithmic effects.\nBesides, the surface critical behavior of the three-dimensional disordered semi-infinite Ising ferromagnetic has\nbeen studied, using Monte Carlo simulations [185]; it is found that for Js less than Jsc , the corresponding surface\ncritical exponent is equal to the one of perfect surface [186-192].\nUsing the perturbative theory, Harris [193] have studied the layering transitions at T = 0 in the presence of\na transverse field. The effect of finite size on such transitions has been studied, in thin film confined between\nparallel plates or walls, by Nakanishi and Fisher [194] using mean field theory and by Bruno etal . [195] taking into\naccount the capillary condensation effect. The critical wetting transitions have been considered in systems with\ncorrugated periodic walls [195] by using an effective Hamiltonian study. By applying Monte Carlo simulations\non thin Ising films with competing walls, Binder et al. [196], found that occurring phase transitions belong to the\nuniversality class of the two-dimensional Ising model and found that the transition is shifted to a temperature\njust below the wetting transition of a semi-infinite fluid [197,198]. Hanke etal . [199] show that symmetry breaking\nfields give rise to nontrivial and long-ranged order parameter profiles for critical systems such as fluids, alloys,\nor magnets confined to wedges. The existence of the layering transitions for a film, with corrugated surface\nhas been studied using mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulations [200]. It is found that the wetting\ntemperature Tw depends weakly on the surface corrugation degree for fixed values of the surface magnetic field.\nIn addition, by applying a suitable effective interface model at liquid-vapor coexistence, Rejmer etal . [201] found\na filling transition at which the height of the meniscus becomes macroscopically large while the planar walls of\nthe wedge far away from its remain non-wet up to the wetting transition occurring at Tw . They also showed\nthat the discontinuous filling transition is accompanied by a pre-filling line extending into the vapor phase of\nthe bulk phase diagram and describing a transition from a small to a large, but finite, meniscus height. Much\nattention has been paid to the properties of layered structures consisting of alternating magnetic materials.\nThe most commonly studied magnetic multilayers are those of ferromagnetic transition metal such as Co or\n\n9\n\n\fNi. Many experiments have shown that the magnetization enhancement exists in multilayered films consisting\nof magnetic layers. It was found that ferromagnetic coupling can exist between magnetic layers. From the\ntheoretical point of view, great interest has been paid to spin wave excitations as well as critical phenomena\n[202-215]. The study of thin films is partly motivated by the development of new growth and characterization\ntechniques, but perhaps more so by the discovery of many exciting new properties, some quite unanticipated.\nThese include, more recently, the discovery of enormous values of magnetoresistance in magnetic multilayers far\nexceeding those found in single layer films and the discovery of oscillatory interlayer coupling in transition metal\nmultilayers. These experimental studies have motivated much theoretical work. However these developments\nare applied to a large extent powered by \"materials engineering\" and the ability to control and understand\nthe growth of thin layers only a few atoms thick. However, Many experimental studies have shown that the\nmagnetization enhancement exists in multilayered films consisting of magnetic layers. The development of the\nmolecular beam epitaxy technique and its application to the growth of thin metallic films has simulated renewed\ninterest in thin film magnetism. The fabrication of thin metallic films has led to a surge of experimental activity\n[216-219]. More recently, the thickness dependence of the critical temperature of thin Ising magnetic films\nhaving surface exchange enhancement has been studied by Hong [71] and by Aguilera-Granja and Moran Lopez\n[220] within mean field approximation, by Hai and Li [221] and Wiatrowski et al. [222] within an effective field\ntreatment that accounts for the self-spin correlations.\nOn the other hand, ferroelectric films can be described by an Ising model in a transverse field [223-225],\nand when the film becomes very thick, its properties are those of the semi-infinite Ising system [108-110,226].\nPhase transitions in Ising spin systems, driven entirely by quantum fluctuations, have been getting a lot of\nattention [227]. The simplest of such systems is the Ising model in a transverse field which can be exactly\nsolved in one dimension. This model has been introduced to explain the phase transition of hydrogen-bonded\nferroelectrics such as KH2 P O4 [228]. Since then, this model has been applied to several physical systems like\nDyVO2 and studied by a variety of sophisticated techniques [92,96,229,230].The technique of differential operator\nintroduced by Kaneyoshi [231] is as simple as the mean field method and uses a generalized but approximate\nCallen relation derived by Sa Barreto and Fittipaldi [115]. The system has a finite transition temperature, which\ncan be decreased by increasing the transverse field to a critical value \u03a9c . The effect of a transverse field on\nthe critical behavior and the magnetization curves was studied [92,96,229-233]. Using the perturbative theory,\nHarris et al. [193] have studied the layering transitions at T = 0 in the presence of a transverse field. The\neffect of a uniform transverse magnetic field on the layering and wetting transitions of a spin\u22121/2 Ising model\nin a longitudinal magnetic field and showed the existence of layering and wetting transitions above a critical\ntransverse field \u03a9w , which is a function of the temperature and surface magnetic field [79] . Recently, Karevski\net al.[82] have studied the random transverse Ising spin chain according to a distribution of the transverse field\ngoverned by a law of type: z \u2212\u03b1 ; z being the distance from the surface and \u03b1 a constant).\nOn the other hand, The simplest of all random quantum systems is the random transverse Ising model\n[234,235]. However, the random systems have been known to be dominated by rare regions. This effect is\nparticularly pronounced for random quantum systems at low or zero temperature far from critical points.\nIndeed, Griffiths [236] showed that the free energy is a non analytic function, because of rare regions. Having\n\n10\n\n\ffound all the derivatives being finite, Harris [237] concluded that this effect was very weak for classical systems.\nThe spin-1 Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions, both bilinear and bi-quadratic, and with a crystalfield interaction was introduced by Blume, Emery, and Griffiths (BEG)[104] to describe phase separation and\nsuperfluid ordering in 3 He \u22124 He mixtures. With vanishing bi-quadratic interactions the model is known as the\nBlume-Capel model [103]. Since its introduction, the spin-1 BEG model has been extended to solid-liquid-gas\nsystems, and multi-component fluid liquid crystal mixtures [105], magnetic materials [238-240], critical behavior\nand multi-critical phase diagrams [241-244]. Furthermore it is the simplest model that can be used for modeling\nthe behavior of the liquid, solid and vapor phases of a real materials. In this context it was used by Jayanthi\n[245] to study the surface melting of the solid phase near the triple point and by Gelb [246] to characterize the\nlayering transitions and surface melting both near and away from the bulk coexistence lines under the effect\nof temperature. The effects of quantum transverse field on wetting and layering transitions of a spin-1 BEG\nmodel are also studied [79,247,248].\n\n2\n\nEffects of surface potential and surface coupling on wetting and\nlayering transitions\n\n2.1\n2.1.1\n\nThe effect of magnetic surface field\nModel\n\nWe consider a spin-1/2 Ising model, with ferromagnetic coupling on a three dimensional cubical lattice consisting\nof N parallel square lattice layers at spacing a to make a \"film\" of finite thickness , limited by a single substrate.\nEach layer has A sites, labeled i,j , and at each site is an Ising spin variable \u03c3i , which is in the simplest S = 1/2\ncase takes the values \u00b11.

Our\nrenormalization group calculation show in all situations that the reduced interlayer coupling iterates to infinity for the two-dimensional layers, while these parameters iterate to a fixed point (at T = 0, this parameters\niterate to infinity) in the one-dimensional layer case. The behavior of the other parameters in Eq. (10) is\nmuch more interesting in that it reflects the transition found in the three-dimensional ferromagnet films [69,70].\nThe ferromagnetic layer state is characterized by the value of the renormalized reduced magnetic field, applied\n(n)\n\non this layer, in the trivial fixed point. If hp\nthe layer p is ferromagnetic \"up\" and if\n\n(n)\nhp\n\niterates to +\u221e for sufficiently large iteration n, the state of\n\niterates to \u2212\u221e, the state of the layer p is ferromagnetic \"down\".\n\nWe remark that the result is independent of the choice of the scale factor of the real-space renormalization group.\n\n2.1.3\n\nTransfer matrix method (TM)\n\nThe model described by the Hamiltonian (1) is also studied using transfer matrix method . This method\nconsists in studying a d-dimensional strips which are infinite in one direction and finite in the remaining ones\n13\n\n\fl+1\n\nl\n\nk\n\np\n\nFigure 2: The strip used within the finite size method, the transfer is made from the plane l to the plane l + 1.\nCyclic boundary conditions are made in the direction k and free boundary conditions in the direction p (p is\nthe layer index).\n\n[70]. This system with a periodic boundary condition on one finite direction (parallel to the substrate) and the\nfree boundary conditions on the perpendicular direction to the substrate, is similar to a (d \u2212 1) dimensional\n\nlayers (see Fig. 2). The partition function Z of this strip is written under the matrix product form (2N M , 2N M )\ncalled the transfer matrix, M is the width of the strips and N is the number of layers, namely:\nZ=\n\n\u221e\nY\n\nV (L, L + 1)\n\n(13)\n\nL=1\n\nThis makes the transfer, from the plane L to the plane L+1, in the infinite direction.\n\nThe elements of this matrix are given by\nX\nX\nV (i, j) = exp(\n\u03c3(p, k, i)(\u03c3(p + 1, k, i) + \u03c3(p, k + 1, i) + \u03c3(p, k, j)) +\nhp \u03c3(p, k, i)]/t)\n\n(14)\n\np\n\np,k\n\nwhere hp = Hp /J; t = T /J and \u03c3(p, k, i) is the spin variable which takes two values \u00b11; p = 1, ..., N ; i and j\n\ntakes 2N M values ; p is the layer index which takes N values and k takes M values. The periodic conditions\non the direction k indicate that \u03c3(N + 1, k, i) = 0. The free energy per site is given by f = \u2212T Log(\u03bbMax )\nwhere \u03bbMax is the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix. In order to determine the state of each layer, it is\nnecessary to define the magnetization per site on the layer p as follows,\nmp = \u2212\n\n\u2202f\n\u2202hp\n\n(15)\n\nwhere hp is the reduced magnetic field applied on a layer p. The magnetization mp of a layer p can be positive\nor negative. However, if mp is positive, the state of the layer p is ferromagnetic \"up\", while if mp is negative,\nthe state of such layer is ferromagnetic \"down\". The transition of this layer is given by the change of the\nmagnetization sign.\n14\n\n\f2.1.4\n\nMean Field Theory\n\nThe mean field state equations of the Hamiltonian (1) may be obtained from the variational functional,\nF [mp ] =\n\nN\nX\np=1\n\nT[\n\n1 + mp\n1 \u2212 mp\nLog(1 \u2212 mp ) +\nLog(1 + mp ) \u2212 Log(2)]\n2\n2\n\u2212Hp mp \u2212\n\nJ\nmp (mp\u22121 + 4mp + mp+1 }\n2\n\n(16)\n\nwith the free boundaries conditions m0 = mN +1 = 0. At the global minimum of the functional free energy(Eq.16), the magnetization per site in the layer p is < \u03c3p >= mmin\n, and the free energy of the system is\np\nF = F [mmin\n]. The stationary condition \u2202F/\u2202mp = 0 leads to the mean field state equations,\np\n1\nmp = tanh[ (mp\u22121 + 4mp + mp+1 + hp )]; p = 1, ..., N\nT\n\n(17)\n\nThese equations are solved numerically using iterative method. Different initial guesses can lead to different\nsolutions of the Eq. 17; the one which makes the variational functional free energy smallest is selected as the\nglobal minimum. At the transition of the layer p, the magnetization mp has a discontinuity for a temperature\nsmaller than the critical-end-point temperature.\n2.1.5\n\nUniform surface magnetic field\n\nAt first it is useful and instructive to find the ground state of the Hamiltonian (1) describing the phase diagrams\nin the (hs \u2212 h) plane at T = 0K, this is determined analytically. We denote here after by 1p 0q the configuration\nhaving p layers with positive magnetization and q layers with negative ones. The ground state phase diagram\nis presented in Fig. 3. It is found that there exist two different situations depending on the value of the surface\nmagnetic field. Indeed, for hs < N/(N \u2212 1) we have one transition (0N \u2194 1N ), at H = \u2212hs /N in which the\nN layers transit simultaneously and for hs > N/(N \u2212 1), we have two transitions; one at H = \u22121/(N \u2212 1),\n\n(1N \u2194 10N \u22121 ) where the surface magnetization does not changes the sign, but the remaining (N \u2212 1) layers\ntransit simultaneously , and the second (10N \u22121 \u2194 0N ),at H = a + bhs , where only the top layer (surface)\n\ntransits (i.e the surface magnetization changes the sign).\n\nAt finite temperature, numerical calculations are done in the case of a thin films N = 3. However, within\nRSRG and TM methods we obtain one transition (0N \u2194 1N ) for hs < 1.5 and T < TL (Fig. 4a), in agreement\nwith the ground state results, and three transitions (03 \u2194 102 \u2194 12 0 \u2194 13 ) for TL < T < Tc . For hs > 1.5,\n\nwe obtain two transitions (03 \u2194 102 \u2194 13 ) for T < TL as predicted by the ground state calculations and\n\nthree transitions (03 \u2194 102 \u2194 12 0 \u2194 13 ) (Fig. 4b). Tc is the transition temperature of a three layer film\n\n(N = 3). The layering temperature TL above which a sequence of layer transitions occurs depends strongly\non the strength of the potential of substrate, i.e the value of the surface magnetic field hs . Within MFT only\nthe ground state phases appear at finite temperature, since MFT neglects correlation between spins, hence the\neffects of thermal fluctuations are negligible, and then does not raise the degeneration of the states at T > 0.\n\n15\n\n\f1.5\n\nHs/J\n\n0\n13\n-0.5\n1O2\nO3\nH/J\n\nFigure 3: Phase diagram at T = 0 in the uniform field case and N = 3.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nT/J\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nT/J\n\n0\n12O\n\n13\n-0.4\n\n13\n-0.5\n\n1O2\n\n1O2\n\nO3\n-0.8\n\nO3\n\nH/J\nH/J\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: Phase diagram in (T \u2212 h) plane for N = 3 obtained within RSRG in the uniform magnetic case ; (a)\nhs = 1.2 < 1.5 ; (b) hs = 1.8 > 1.5 [69,70]\n\n16\n\n12O\n\n\f1.63\n\n11.36\n\nHs/J\n\n0\n13\n-0.63\n1O2\n\n-1.42\nO3\n\n12O\n\nH/J\n\nFigure 5: Phase diagram at T = 0 in the variable field case and N = 3.\n\n2.1.6\n\nVariable surface magnetic field\n\nIn this case the problem is quite different from the uniform surface magnetic field since for sufficiently large\nvalue of hs the layering transitions occur at T = 0K (Fig. 5). However for hsq < hs < hsq+1 with q = 1, ...N ;\nwe have q transitions in the hs \u2212 h plane namely (0N \u2194 10N \u22121 \u2194 12 0N \u22122 \u2194 ...1q\u22121 04\u2212q \u2194 1q ), where hs1 = 0,\nhs2 = 1.63, hs3 = 11.36 and hs4 = \u221e.\nUsing RSRG and TM methods, three different cases are distinguished, at finite temperature:\ni)For hs < hs2 only one transition (03 \u2194 13 ) persists for T < TL and three transitions (03 \u2194 102 \u2194 12 0 \u2194 13 )\nfor TL < T < Tc (Fig. 6a).\nii)For hs2 < hs < hs3 we have two transitions (03 \u2194 102 \u2194 13 ) for T < TL , while for T > TL , (Fig. 6b) we\n\nobtain three transitions (03 \u2194 102 \u2194 12 0 \u2194 13 ). While MFT gives rise to only two transitions (03 \u2194 102 \u2194 13 )\nfor any value of hs smaller than hs3 even for T > TL .\niii)For a strong potential of the substrate (hs > hs3 ), the layering temperature TL vanishes, and then, the\n\nthree methods give rise to the appearance of three transitions, (03 \u2194 102 \u2194 12 0 \u2194 13 ), for any temperature\n0 < T < Tc (Fig. 6c)\n\n2.2\n\nSurface coupling effects\n\nWe consider the Hamiltonian given in Eq.1, in which, in this case, the surface and bulk couplings are different;\nJi,j = Js and Ji,j = Jb if {i, j} are in the surface and the bulk respectively (Fig. 7).\n\nIn the following, the notation 1k ON \u2212k means that a configuration of the system have the first k layers with\n\npositive magnetizations and the remaining N \u2212 k layers with negative ones. However, there exist N + 1 possible\nconfigurations for a film formed with N square layers. Numerical calculations are limited to \u03b1 = 2.0, since the\nresults for other values of \u03b1 are qualitatively the same.\nAt T = 0, and for (N \u2265 3), there is only three allowed transitions.

This figure is plotted for a system\nsize with N = 10 layers, a magnetic surface field Hs /Jb = 1.0 and a surface coupling constant Js /Jb = 1.5 [250]\n\nAt T 6= 0, Fig. 8 shows that the layering temperature, TL , above which a succession of layering transitions\noccurs is greater than the \"surface transition\" temperature. Hence, the film thickness must be at least equal\nto three layers and so the results established throughout this work correspond to films with a thickness N \u2265 3\nlayers.\nIt is understood that the wetting temperature Tw /Jb is close to the limit of TL /Jb for a sufficiently thick\nfilm (N \u2192 \u221e). The layering temperature behavior as a function of the system size is illustrated in Figs. 9a\nand 9b for two surface field values and several values of the surface coupling. However, for smaller values of the\nsurface field, the layering and wetting temperatures are independent of the surface coupling for large system\nsizes as it is shown in Fig. 9a. While for higher values of the surface field (Fig. 9b), the wetting and layering\ntemperatures depend strongly on the surface coupling values. Indeed, there exist three different classes of the\nlayering temperature behaviors:\n(i)TL increases with the film thickness and stabilizes at a certain fixed value. Such behavior occurs at small\nvalues of Js and any value of hs .\n(ii)TL increases until a certain film thickness above which it decreases exhibiting a maximum. This situation\ntake place for medium values of both Js and hs .\n(iii)TL decreases continuously and stabilizes at a value close to Tw . This behavior occurs at higher values of Js .\nFurthermore, the wetting temperature Tw , which is the limit value of TL for L sufficiently large, is independent of Js for small values of hs . While for higher values of hs , it depends strongly on the Js and decreases when\nhs increases. Indeed, this is because the surface region becomes magnetically harder than the deeper layers,\nand as the film is thicker, the strength of the internal magnetic field decreases, which leads to a decrease of Tw .\n\n20\n\n\f(b)\nFig. 9b\n\nF ig. 9a\n\n(a)\n\n5,8\n\n0.1\n\n5,5\n\n1.5\n5,0\n\nTL/Jb\n\n5,6\n\n0.9\n\n4,5\n\n1.2\n\n5,2\n\n4,0\n\nTL/Jb\n\n5,4\n\n3,5\n3,0\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n2,5\n\n1.8\n\n5,0\n2,0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0\n\n30\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nNumber of layers\n\nN u m be r of la yers\n\nFigure 9: Layering temperature, TL /Jb , behavior as a function of the number of layers. a) Hs /Jb = 0.1 and b)\nHs /Jb = 1.0. The number accompanying each curve denotes the surface coupling Js /Jb value [250]\n\nWe note that, the three distinct behaviors mentioned above are separated by two critical surface coupling Jsc1\nand Jsc2 . Indeed, Jsc1 separates the behaviors (i) and (ii), while Jsc2 separates the behaviors (ii) and (iii).\nThe dependence of Jsc1 and Jsc2 as a function of hs is plotted in Fig. 10.\nJsc1 and Jsc2 correspond to two critical surface fields hsc1 and hsc2 separating the three different regimes\nof the layering temperature TL . However, for sufficiently large values of Js (Js /Jb \u2265 1.30), TL decreases when\nincreasing the film thickness N for any values of hs . While, for Js < 1.3, the temperature TL exhibits the three\nbehaviors; (i), (ii) and (iii) depending on the value of hs . In particular for hs \u2265 hsc2 , TL is always decreasing\nfunction of the film thickness. The layering temperature behavior is plotted, in Fig. 11, for a fixed system size\nN = 5 layers and several value of hs . It is found that TL increases and decreases for small and higher values of\nhs respectively. On the other hand, the wetting temperature, Fig. 11, is not affected by the surface coupling\nvariations for small surface field values, while for higher hs , Tw decreases abruptly and stabilizes at a certain\nlimit, when increasing the surface coupling.\n\n2.3\n\nThe surface crystal field effects\n\nThe system we are studying here is formed with N coupled ferromagnetic square layers in the presence of a\ncrystal field. The Hamiltonian governing this system is given by\nH=\u2212\n\nX\n\nJij Si Sj +\n\nX\n\n\u2206i (Si )2\n\n(18)\n\ni\n\n<i,j>\n\nwhere, Sl (l = i, j) = \u22121, 0, +1 are the spin variables. The interactions between different spins are assumed to be\nconstant so that Jij = J. All sites i of a given layer k, (k = 1, 2, ..., N ) are subject to a crystal field amplitude\n\u2206i = \u2206k so that \u22061 > \u22062 > ... > \u2206N . The crystal field of a layer k is given by:\n\u2206k = \u2206s /k \u03b1\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u2206s = \u22061 is the crystal field acting on the surface (first layer k = 1) and \u03b1 a positive constant. For a system\nwith \u03b1 = 0, a constant crystal field is applied on each layer of the film. Whereas, for \u03b1 \u2192 \u221e, the crystal field\n21\n\n\fFig. 10\n1,4\n\nCritical surface coupling\n\n1,2\n\n1,0\n\nJsc2/Jb\n0,8\n\nJsc1/Jb\n(iii)\n\n0,6\n\n(ii)\n\n0,4\n\n(i)\n0,2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nH s/Jb\nFigure 10: Critical surface coupling, Jsc1 /Jb and Jsc2 /Jb , profiles as a function of the surface magnetic field\nHs /Jb for: the (USF) case.

Experimental studies of a sequence of reentrant layering transitions of\nargon and krypton adsorbed on graphite substrate are given in Ref. [54], in which the algebraically decaying of\nthe applied field according to a law of type (k \u2212\u03b1 )have been used. However, the quantities computed, using the\nMonte Carlo simulations for each layer k containing Nx spins in x\u2212direction and Ny spins in the y\u2212direction,\nare:\n-The layer average magnetizations\nX\nmk = (\nSi )/(Nx Ny )\n\n(20)\n\n\u03c7m,k = \u03b2Nx Ny < (mk \u2212 < mk >)2 >\n\n(21)\n\ni\u01ebk\n\n-The layer magnetic susceptibilities\n\n-The layer quadrupolar magnetic susceptibilities expressed as\n\u03c7q,k = \u03b2Nx Ny < (qk \u2212 < qk >)2 >\n\n(22)\n\nX\nqk = (\nSi 2 )/(Nx Ny ).\n\n(23)\n\nwith\ni\u01ebk\n\n-The layer critical exponents \u03b3m,k related to the corresponding layer magnetic susceptibilities \u03c7m,k , for a fixed\nlayer k, giving by\n\u03b3m,k =\n\n\u2202Log(\u03c7m,k )\u22121\n\u2202Log | Tc,k /J \u2212 T /J |\n\n(24)\n\nwhere T /J stands for the reduced absolute temperature and Tc,k /J is the reduced critical temperature of the\nlayer k. In the above equations \u03b2 = 1/(kB T ) with kB being the Boltzmann constant.\nThe notation Dk ON \u2212k means that the first k layers from the surface are disordered while the remaining N \u2212 k\nlayers are ordered. The ground state phase diagram (Fig. 12) of this model [102], shows that, there exist only\nk0 possible layer transition which depends on \u03b1 and N.\nFor T > 0 Monte Carlo simulations shows, for N = 10, that the last layers k = 8, 9 and 10 transit\nsimultaneously at \u2206s /J \u2248 23.84.\nPhase diagrams exhibit critical, tricritical and reentrant behaviors (Fig. 13). The latter is due, for the first\nk0 layers, to the competition between thermal fluctuations, the crystal field and an effective magnetic field\ncreated by the deeper ordered layers. Indeed, when these thermal fluctuations become sufficiently important,\nthe magnetization of some spins, of deeper layers, becomes nonzero (+1 or -1). This leads to the appearance of\nan effective magnetic field.\nThis magnetic field is responsible of the ordered phase seen for the layer k. This argument can also explain\nthe absence of the reentrant phenomena for the last N \u2212 k0 layers, once the value of the crystal field is not\nsufficient to overcome the effective magnetic field created by the remaining deeper layers. It is worth to note\nthat the reentrant phenomena is always present for the layers k, (k \u2264 k0 ), and the corresponding tri-critical\npoints Ci are located at a constant temperature. At the first order transition the layer quadrupolar magnetic\nsusceptibilities \u03c7q,k , present a strong peak at the surface crystal field transition (Fig. 14).\nWhile the magnetic susceptibilities \u03c7m,k , present a strong peak at the second order transition (Fig. 15).\n23\n\n\fFig. 12\n5\n\n4\n\nO\n\nN\n\n3\n\nN -1\n\nJ\n\nDO\n\n2\n\nD O\n\n2\n\nN -2\n\n3\n\nD O\n...\n\n1\n\nD\n\nk0\n\nN\n\nN -3\n\nD O\n\nN -k 0\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n\u2206s\n\nFigure 12: The ground state phase diagram in the plane (J, \u2206s ) for a film formed with N layers.

We note that the critical exponent of a 2D\nlayer in a film is different than the one of a free 2D-layer.Indeed the critical exponent of a layer depends on its\nposition (Fig. 17).\n\n2.4\n2.4.1\n\nThe effect of the inhomogeneity of substrate\nModel\n\nThe effect of the inhomogeneity of the substrate on the wetting transitions is studied, using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, in the case of a spin-1/2 Ising ferromagnetic film formed by N coupled square layers, in which the\nsurface magnetic field Hs acts only on alternate clusters of spins of the surface (k = 1) indicated by the symbols\n(+); while Hs is absent on clusters of symbols (o) (Fig. 18).

However, depending on the\nvalues of H, the (T, H) phase diagram established in Fig. 19 shows the existence of three different phases, for\na fixed surface magnetic field Hs . The totally wet (TW), the nonwet (NW) and the partially wet phases.\nIn the latter case, we can distinguish, in each layer, three different holes configurations namely; the (PWTD)\nconfigurations in which the layer is partially wet with a total disconnection of the holes; the (PWPD) configurations in which the layer is partially wet with a partial disconnection of the holes; the (PWTC) configurations\ncorresponding to a partially wet layer with a totally connected holes. Fig. 19 shows that at sufficiently low\ntemperature, the Partial wet disappears, while at higher temperature values, provided that T is kept less than\nthe critical value Tc = 3.87, the partially wet phase is found.\nFurthermore the surface magnetic field Hs favors the appearance of the (PWPD) phase. In Figs. 20, we\ngive, for the fourth layer, an example of three different partial wet phases; (PWTC), (PWPD) and (PWTD) in\nwhich the distributions of holes are different.\n2.4.3\n\nThe size distribution of holes in a layer\n\nIn the (TW), (PWTC) and (NW) phases, all spins are negative, only one big hole exist and all spins are positive\nrespectively. However the distribution of size of holes is important in both (PWTD) and (PWPD) phases in\nwhich there is a great number of disconnected holes with different sizes. In Fig. 21 we give the distribution\nof sizes of holes, in each layer (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) of the film, in the (PWTD) phase, for a temperature T = 3.5,\nHs = 2.0 and H = \u22120.142.

Indeed, far from the\nsurface, the effect of the surface field becomes less relevant and then the holes are equally distributed. Such\nresult is illustrated in Fig. 21 in the k = 4 case.\n\n3\n\nGeometry effect on wetting and layering transitions\n\n3.1\n3.1.1\n\nCorrugated surface effects\nModel and method\n\nWe consider a film with finite thickness of a three dimensional spin-1/2 Ising model, with M square layers,\nlimited by two surfaces (Fig. 22).

In the following we will limit our interest to a system with HSb = \u2212HSt .\nThe mean field equations describing the magnetization of the system is given by\nm(x, z) = tanh(\u03b2(2m(x, z) + m(x, z + 1) + m(x, z \u2212 1) + m(x + 1, z) + m(x \u2212 1, z) + H(x, z)))\n\n(29)\n\nThe total free energy of the system can be derived as :\nF [m(x, z)] =\n\nP\n\nx,z {T [\n\n1\u2212m(x,z)\nLog(1\n2\n\n\u2212 m(x, z)) +\n\n1+m(x,z)\nLog(1\n2\n\n+ m(x, z))]\n\n\u2212 J2 m(x, z)[2m(x, z) + m(x, z + 1) + m(x, z \u2212 1) + m(x + 1, z) + m(x \u2212 1, z)]\n\n(30)\n\n\u2212m(x, z)H(x, z)}\nThe free boundary conditions are considered to solve the mean field equations.\n3.1.2\n\nThe corrugated surface critical behavior\n\nIn this case the critical exponents are computed, for Hs = 0 and H = 0, using mean field theory. At the vicinity\nof the critical temperature Tc , the spontaneous magnetization m(z, t), of each layer z, vanishes with a power\nlaw given by\nm(z, t) = t\u03b2ef f (z,t)\n\n(31)\n\nThen the effective exponent \u03b2ef f (z, t) can be defined as\n\u03b2ef f (z, t) = dln(m(z, t))/dln(t)\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t = |T \u2212 Tc |/Tc is the reduced temperature and m(z, t) is the average value of m(x, z, t) on x. For\nsufficiently small values of t, \u03b2ef f (z, t) approaches the asymptotic critical exponent \u03b2(z). The surface critical\noccurs when z = 1 denoted by \u03b21 = \u03b2(z = 1). The effective exponent can be approximated at discrete reduced\ntemperatures ti and ti+1 as\n\u03b2ef f (z, t) = ln[m(z, ti )/m(z, ti+1 )]/ln(ti /ti+1 ).\n\n(33)\n\nHowever, in the vicinity of the film critical temperature Tc , the profile of the effective critical exponent \u03b2ef f (z, n)\nis presented in Fig. 23.\nIt is clear that at the surface, the effective critical exponent remains independent of the number of steps.\nWhile for any layer z with n1 < z < n2 , it depends strongly on the number of steps. For a fixed number of\nsteps, the thermal variation of the effective exponent is presented in Fig. 24.\nIt is found that far from the transition temperature, \u03b2ef f (z, n) decreases with increasing z, shows a crossover\nat z = n, continues to decrease until it becomes constant in the depth of the system and increases again in the\nvicinity of the bottom surface. If we increase the temperature to approach the critical temperature, the crossover\nbecomes less pronounced. The dependence of the effective critical exponent as a function of temperature shows\n32\n\n\fz\n\nFigure 23: The dependence of the effective exponent as a function of layer position z in the case of corrugated\nsurface, for L = 31, d = 60, n = 8, and J1 = Js = JL .

The number accompanying each curve denotes the layer position z [198]\n\nthat the exponent is insensitive to the corrugation in agreement with Monte-Carlo results [175]. The effect of\nthe number of steps on the behavior of \u03b2ef f (z, t) for a given layer z, in the vicinity of the ordinary transition,\nis illustrated in Fig. 25.\nHowever, when the number of steps n is sufficiently smaller than the values of z, \u03b2ef f (z, n) is insensitive\nof the number of steps, when n increases more, \u03b2ef f (z, n) increases and once n exceeds the value of z, then\n\u03b2ef f (z, n) becomes independent of the number of steps, i.e after a certain degree of corrugation,\u03b2ef f (z, n) will\nbe insensitive to the number of steps and then takes a saturation value, this value varies upon varying z.\n3.1.3\n\nWetting transition of a corrugated surface\n\nIn the following, we denote by (Sk , k = 1, 2, ...) a configuration in which the top surface St and the first k \u2212 1\nlayers of the bulk have positive magnetizations; while the remaining M \u2212 k layers have negative ones. The\nground state phase diagram is investigated exactly. In contrast to the case of perfect surface, in the case of\nshort range substrate potential, the prewetting and layering transitions occurs at T = 0K (Fig. 26).\nAt finite temperature, phase diagrams obtained using Monte-Carlo simulations (Fig. 27) shows that the\nwetting temperature depends weakly on the surface corrugation degree but it depends strongly on lateral size\nof the system. Furthermore the behavior of the magnetization as a function of the external magnetic field is\npresented in Fig. 28a , for a fixed layer (z = 3) and several values of the position x in the x-direction.\nIt is clear that, the increasing of the external bulk field, the top surface (x=18) exhibits a first order transition\nfrom negative to positive magnetization, accompanied by the transition of the bulk site located near the surface\nat z=3. This is due to both thermal fluctuations and the surface effect in the x-direction. The other bulk sites\n\n34\n\n\fFigure 26: Phase diagram of the ground state, in the (H/J, HSt /J) plane, for a system with M = 10 layers,\nn = 2 steps and L = 10 spins per step, with the condition HSb = \u2212HSt [200].\n\nFigure 27: Layer transitions of the system, in the (H/J, T /J) plane, using Monte Carlo simulations for HSt /J =\n0.9 [200].\n\n35\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 28: Magnetisation profiles as a function of the reduced bulk field H/J for HSt /J = 0.9 and T /J = 3.5.\nThe magnetizations m(x, z) are plotted for a fixed layer z = 3 and different positions x (a), and for a fixed\nposition x = 0 and different layers z (b) [200].\n\nkeep their negative magnetizations. This is called \"prelayer transition\". Such behavior was obtained neither in\nthe perfect surface nor at T = 0K cases. However, by increasing H the so-called layer transition occurs when\nthe magnetizations of the remaining bulk sites of the layer z,(z = 3) jump from negative values to positive ones.\nThe effect of surfaces in the z-direction, is presented in Fig. 28b in which the local magnetization m(x, z) is\npresented as a function of H for a fixed value of x(x = 0) and several layers z. It is clear that the bulk field, at\nwhich the transition Sk \u2194 Sk+1 , (k = 0, 1, ..., M \u2212 1) occurs, increases with increasing k.\nMoreover, using mean field theory, it is shown that the wetting temperature depends weakly on the corrugation degree n. Indeed, Tw = 2.55 for n = 2, Tw = 2.59 for n = 4 for a film with thickness N = 10. We note that\nthe corrugate surface leads to the appearance of wetting in both longitudinal (z) and transverse (x) directions.\n\n3.2\n\nEdge wetting in a three-dimensional system\n\nWe consider a spin-1/2 Ising model in a lattice formed with N layers, each one of them is constituted by two\nperpendicular perfect planes and contains 2(N \u2212 k) + 1 spin chains which are infinite in the y-direction (Fig.\n29). The system is considered under the effects of an uniform surface magnetic field Hs applied on the planes\n(x, y, z = 1) ,(x = 1, y, z) of the layer k = 1 and an external magnetic field H applied on all spins of the system.\n\n36\n\n\fFigure 29: Geometry of the system formed with two surfaces (x, y, z = 1) and (x = 1, y, z) with N spins in\nboth the x and z\u2212directions.

In particular, the notation 1N (resp. ON ) will be used to denote\na configuration with positive magnetization for all layer spins (resp. negative magnetization for all layer spins)\nof the system.

However, the other layer-by-layer transitions occur when increasing the external field\nat specific temperature values.\nAs one can expects, the external field values needed to make arising the intra-layering and inter-layering\ntransitions[40] increase with increasing the order of the layer counted from the surface k = 1. This is qualitatively\nin good agreement with previous works [1-12,69,70]. it is seen that the increasing system size effect is to decrease\nthe intra and inter layering temperature values. The bulk layering transitions are shifted to higher external\nmagnetic field values, for a fixed surface magnetic field value.\nThe behavior of the surface, TLs , and the bulk TLb intra-layering temperature profiles as a function of the thickness\nN , for two values of HS /J = 1.0 and HS /J = 0.9 is presented in Figs.33.\nIt is clear that TLs as well as TLb decreases when increasing the system size. For a fixed system size N , these\nintra-layering temperatures decrease when increasing the surface magnetic field values. Moreover, TLb reaches\nthe wetting temperature for sufficiently large values of the system size. These results means that the edge leads\nto the appearance of the intralayering transitions which are absent in the case of perfect surfaces [1-12,45,69,70]\nand the continuous model (Milchev et al. [40]),[47-51]; On the other hand it leads to a decay of the wetting\ntemperature compared with the perfect surface case [1-12,45,69,70]. This is in good agreement with the results\nobtained in Ref.

On the other hand, when T > Tw , the layering transitions exist in the absence of the\ntransverse magnetic field, this means that the temperature effect is sufficient to produce layering transitions.\n(T, \u03a9) Phase diagram is presented in Fig. 34.\nHowever, the wetting transverse magnetic field, \u03a9w , decreases with increasing temperature and/or decreasing\nsurface magnetic field.\n\n4.2\n\nVariable surface transverse field\n\nIn this case we consider a surface variable transverse field, the transverse field of a layer z (distance from the\nsubstrate) is given by:\n\u03a9z = \u03a9s /z \u03b1\n\n(41)\n\nwith \u03a9s corresponding to the transverse magnetic field applied on the first layer z = 1.

Phase diagrams for \u03b1 = 1.0, is presented in Figs.35. It is found that the layers with higher value of\nz need greater magnetic transverse field values to become disordered.\nHowever, for a fixed temperature, the disorder of each layer occurs when increasing the transverse magnetic\nfield so that \u03a9c (z = 1) < \u03a9c (z = 2) < ... < \u03a9c (z = N ). It is found that in absence of the transverse magnetic\nfield, \u03a9s = 0, the critical temperature for all the layers, 1 \u2264 z \u2264 N , is close to: TcMF (bulk) = 6.0, for the mean\n\nfield theory case, and TcF C (bulk) = 5.073 for the finite cluster method. The corresponding thermal variation of\n\nthe longitudinal and transverse magnetizations are computed using mean field theory and presented respectively\nin Fig. 36a and 36b.\nThe behavior of the longitudinal magnetization critical exponent \u03b3 at a fixed temperature T = 1.0 is also\ncalculated as a function of the exponent \u03b1 . However, \u03b3 depends on the layer z, and decreases from 1, for small\nvalues of \u03b1, to 0.5 for higher values of \u03b1 (Fig. 37)\n\n4.3\n\nRandom transverse field effect on order-disorder layering transitions\n\nNow we consider the case of a surface random transverse field governing by a two peaks distribution law namely:\nP(\u03a9i ) = p\u03b4(\u03a9i \u2212 \u03a9s ) + (1 \u2212 p)\u03b4(\u03a9i )\n\n(42)\n\nwhere p is the probability that \u03a9i acts on a site i of the surface with the value \u03a9s . using finite cluster\napproximation within an expansion technique for spin-1/2 cluster identities, the longitudinal magnetizations\nmzk , for a plane 'k' (k = 1, ..., N ) are well calculated. However, On the other hand, it is shown that for a\nfixed \u03b1 and very low temperatures, each layer k disorders at a critical probability pc (k) corresponding to a\ncritical surface transverse magnetic field \u03a9cs (k). Indeed, as it is shown in Fig. 38a, for \u03b1 = 1.0, the film is\nordered at p \u2264 pc = 0.9949 even for very large values of the surface transverse magnetic field. While for\npc < p \u2264 pc (k = 1) = 0.9950 (Fig. 38b), the first surface becomes disordered. increasing p, the second layer\n42\n\n\fFigure 35: The dependence of the critical temperature Tc on the surface transverse magnetic field, for \u03b1 = 1.0\n(N=20 layers), using the mean field theory [253].\n\nFig. 36(b)\nFig. 36(a)\n\nx\n\nMagnetisations m\n\nMagnetisations m\n\nz\n\n0,8\n\n0,6\n\nN\n\n0,4\n\n1,2\n3\n4\n\n1,00\n\nT=1.0 \u03b1 =1.0\n\n1,0\n\n0,75\n\n0,50\n\nN\n\n0,25\n\n\u03a9 s =50.0 \u03b1 =1.0\n\n0,2\n\n1\n\n2 3\n\n0,0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0\n\n\u03a9s\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nT\n\nFigure 36: The dependence of the longitudinal layer magnetizations (a) as a function the transverse magnetic\nfield for \u03b1 = 1.0 and a fixed temperature: T = 1.0 ; and the thermal behavior of the transverse layer magnetizations (b), for \u03b1 = 1.0 and \u03a9s = 50.0.

Finally the film is totally disordered\nwhen the applied surface transverse magnetic field is acting on all the surface sites (i.e p = 1) (Fig. 38d).\nIt arises that a sequence of order-disorder layering transitions occurs when decreasing probability from the\nvalue p = 1.0, corresponding to a totally ordered film at very low temperatures. We note that the critical\nsurface transverse field \u03a9cs depends on the value of \u03b1 and the probability p. Indeed it is clear from Fig. 39 that\n\u03a9cs increases when increasing \u03b1 and/or decreasing p.\nOn the other hand the profile of the surface critical transverse field (Fig. 40) and the surface critical\nprobability (Fig. 41) shows that \u03a9cs and pcs increases with the depth of the film.\nThe surface critical exponent of the longitudinal magnetization is also computed (Fig. 42) as a function of\n\u03b1 for several values of p. It is found that \u03b3(k) decreases when increasing \u03b1 and/or decreasing p.\n\n4.4\n\nRandom transverse field effect on wetting transitions\n\nNow we will consider the effect of random transverse field on the wetting transition of a spin-1/2 Ising ferromagnetic film in both surface and external magnetic fields, described in Eqs.(36), (42). Using finite cluster\napproximation, numerical calculations are limited to a film with thickness. However, phase diagram in the space\n(T, \u03a9, p) plotted in Fig. 43, shows the existence of a critical value pc , of the probability p, above which the\nwetting transitions disappears.\nThe value of pc depends on the value of Hs . However, Fig. 44 shows that pc decreases when increasing\nHs : indeed, pc decreases linearly for Hs < 0.85, and almost linearly for Hs > 0.85, with a discontinuity at\nHs = 0.85.\nA similar result was found by Harris [237], in the case of both bond and site dilutions, showing that the\ncritical transverse field at zero temperature presents a discontinuity as the concentration passes through the\n\n44\n\n\f(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n[t]\nFigure 38: The dependence of the critical temperature Tc on the surface transverse magnetic field, for \u03b1 = 1.0\nand different values of the probability: p(= 0.9945) < pc (= 0.9949) (a), pc < p \u2264 pc (k = 1) = 0.9950 (b),\npc (k = 1) < p \u2264 pc (k = 2) = 0.9955 (c) and p = 1.0 (d) [254].\n\n45\n\n\fFigure 39:\n\nThe dependence of the critical surface transverse magnetic field \u03a9cs (k = 1) as a function of the\n\nparameter \u03b1 for a fixed temperature T = 0.05 and different probability values: p = 0.9955 < pc = 0.9949,\np = 0.9970, p = 0.9985 and p = 1.0 [247].\n\nFigure 40:\n\nThe dependence of the critical surface transverse magnetic field \u03a9cs (k = 1) as a function of the\n\nnumber of layers for T = 0.05 and different values of the exponent \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03b1 = 1.0, \u03b1 = 1.5 and \u03b1 = 2.0 [247].\n\n46\n\n\fFigure 41: The dependence of the critical probability pc as a function of the number of layers for T = 0.05 and\ndifferent values of the exponent \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03b1 = 1.0, \u03b1 = 1.5 and \u03b1 = 2.0 [247].\n\nFigure 42: The dependence of the surface critical exponent \u03b3(k = 1) on the parameter \u03b1 for a fixed temperature\nT = 1.0 and different values of the probability p [247].\n\n47\n\n\fWetting temperature\n\n2,0\n\n1,5\n\n1,0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0,8\n3\n4\nTran sv\ne rse fi e\nld\n\n5\n\np ro\n\nba b\nil ity\n\np\n\n0,5\n0,0\n0,2\n0,4\n0,6\n\n1,0\n6\n\nFigure 43: Phase diagrams in the (T /J, \u03a9/J, p) space for (Hs1 /J = 0.95, Hs2 /J = \u2212Hs1 /J) [247].\n\nFigure 44: The critical probability pc dependence on the surface field Hs1 /J for T /J = 0.02 [247].\n\n48\n\n\fcritical percolation concentration.\n\n4.5\n\nLayering sublimation transitions of the Blume-Emery-Griffiths in a transverse\nfield\n\nIn this part, we consider a spin-1 BEG model on a simple cubic lattice, governed by the Hamiltonian\nH = \u2212J\n\nX\n\n(i,j)\n\nSiz Sjz \u2212 K\n\nX\n\n(i,j)\n\n2 2\nSiz\nSjz \u2212 \u2206\n\nX\ni\n\n2\nSiz\n\u2212\u03a9\n\nX\n\nSix\n\n(43)\n\ni\n\nwhere J and K represent respectively the bilinear and bi-quadratic couplings, \u2206 is the chemical potential in the\nlattice-gas interpretation [246, 249], \u03a9 is the transverse field, (i,j) indicates summation over nearest-neighbor\nsites of the simple cubic lattice, and Six , Siz Using the mean field theory, the free energy, the longitudinal\nmagnetization and quadrupolar moments are given respectively by:\nf=\n\nN\nX\np=1\n\n\u2212KB T Log[\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\nJ\nexp(\u2212\u03b2\u03bbk (p))] + mz (p)(mz (p \u2212 1) + 4mz (p) + mz (p + 1))\n2\n\n(44)\n\n+K\n2 qz (p)(qz (p \u2212 1) + 4qz (p) + qz (p + 1))\n\nmz (p) =\n\nP3\n\n(45)\n\nqz (p) =\n\nP3\n\n(46)\n\nwhere\n\n2\n2\nk=1 (\u03b1k (p) \u2212 \u03b2k (p))exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03bbk (p))\nP3\nk=1 exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03bbk (p))\n\n2\n2\nk=1 (\u03b1k (p) + \u03b2k (p))exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03bbk (p))\nP3\nk=1 exp(\u2212\u03b2\u03bbk (p))\n\n\u03bbk (p) =\n\u03b1k (p) =\n\n21/2\n\np\n2\n(D(p) + 3 \u033a(p)cos(\u03c6k (p)))\n3\n|\u03a9(\u03bbk (p) \u2212 D(p) + A(p))|\n\np\n\u03a92 ((\u03bbk (p) \u2212 D(p))2 + A2 (p)) + ((\u03bbk (p) \u2212 D(p))2 \u2212 A2 (p))2\n\u03b2k (p) =\n\nwith\n\n\u03bbk (p) \u2212 D(p) \u2212 A(p)\n\u03b1k (p)\n\u03bbk (p) \u2212 D(p) + A(p)\n\n1\narccos(\u221227q(p)/2\u033a(p)) + 2/3(k \u2212 1)\u03c0\n3\n\u221a\n3 3p 2\n\u033a(p) =\n27q (p) + |4r3 (p) + 27q 2 (p)|\n2\n\n\u03c6k (p) =\n\n(47)\n(48)\n(49)\n\n(50)\n(51)\n\nr(p) = \u2212(A2 (p) + \u03a92 ) \u2212 D2 (p)/3\n\n(52)\n\nq(p) = \u2212D(p)(2A2 (p) \u2212 (2/9)D2 (p) \u2212 \u03a92 )/3\n\n(53)\n\nA(p) = \u2212J(mz (p \u2212 1) + 4mz (p) + mz (p + 1))\n\n(54)\n\nD(p) = \u2212\u2206 \u2212 K(qz (p \u2212 1) + 4qz (p) + qz (p + 1))\n\n(55)\n\nWith the free boundary conditions, mz (N + 1) = mz (0) = qz (N + 1) = qz (0) = 0.\nEquations (8) and (9) are the order parameters of the system which enable us to characterize transitions.

The one which\nhave the smaller free energy (19) is accepted as the physical solution. However, numerical calculations are\ndone for N = 64 and K/J = 3 because at the latter value and in the absence of the transverse field, phase\ndiagram of the spin-1 BEG model in temperature and chemical potential plane is equivalent to the solid-gasliquid phase diagram [246]. The solid, liquid and vapor phases are characterized by a high density and non-zero\nmagnetization, a high density and zero magnetization and a low density and zero magnetization respectively\n[246]. We note that the bulk solid-vapor coexistence take place at a chemical potential \u2206coe = \u221212 + 4/N in\n\nthe case T = 0 and \u03a9 = 0. Hence for N=64, \u2206coe = \u221211.9375. Hence, we denote here after by V 2m S N \u22122m ,\nm = 0, 1, ..., N/2 a configuration of the system with m top layers and m bottom layers in the vapor state, while\n\nthe remaining layers of the system are in the solid state; and by LN a configuration with N layers in the liquid\nstate. V N and S N are respectively the bulk vapor and solid states respectively.\nPhase diagram at T=Ok (Fig. 45) shows that a sequence of layering sublimation transition (V 2m S N \u22122m \u2194\n\nV 2m+2 S N \u22122m\u22122 ) appears at different values of the transverse field \u03a9m for a fixed value of chemical potential\n\u2206i \u2212 11.9375 (i.e in the bulk solid region); and then the bulk melting transition (S N \u2194 LN ) occurs at a critical\n\nbulk transverse field \u03a9SL .\nWhile for \u2206h\u2206coe and \u03a9h\u03a9c there is also the bulk vapor-liquid transition (V N \u2194 LN ) which take place at a\ncritical value of a transverse field \u03a9V L , while the solid-liquid-gas bulk coexistence occurs at the triple transverse\nfield \u03a9T and \u2206 = \u2206coe . Such result is qualitatively similar to the one obtained by Gelb [246] under the effect of\ntemperature. In Fig. 46, the bulk density exhibits a discontinuity at the transition low density (Vapor phase)\nto high density (liquid phase) which occurs at \u03a9V L = 5.51 for \u2206 = \u221212.002.\nThe behavior of density and magnetization, as a function of the transverse field \u03a9, are given, for \u2206i\u2206coe , in\nFig. 47a and 47b respectively. It is clear that the transition of a layer p (from solid state to quasi-vapor state)\nis characterized by the jump of both density and magnetization.\nAt T > 0, the (T, \u03a9) phase diagrams presented in Fig. 48 show the existence of a sequence of layering\nsublimation transition for each value of temperature and fixed value of chemical potential, and a solid-liquid\nbulk transition occurs at a transverse field \u03a9SL which depends on the value of chemical potential.\nHowever \u03a9SL increases with increasing chemical potential. For example for T = 1 and \u2206 = \u221211, \u03a9SL = 6.01\n50\n\n\fFigure 46: The dependence of the bulk density of the transverse field for \u2206 = 12.002 and T = 0.

On the other hand the transition line\nof a layer p terminates by an end point of coordinate (Tcp , \u03a9cp ). these endpoints converge towards a roughening\ntemperature TR and roughening transverse field \u03a9R above which all interfaces are rough on a microscopic scale,\nHence TR = 3.07 and \u03a9R = 5.18 in the case of Fig. 48a. Besides, in this figure the critical end point of the\nfirst layer is greater than the second layer end point while in Fig. 48b the critical end point of the first layer\nis smaller than the second layer one. This means that, depending on the value of the chemical potential, there\nexist a critical temperature Ts and critical transverse field \u03a9s at which the surface transition occurs while the\nother layers transitions cannot take place for any value of transverse field.\n\n5\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
