Introduction\nThe recent discovery of graphene [1], a flat monolayer of carbon atoms tightly packed into\na two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice, has attracted great attention, in particular\nafter the experimental observation of a non standard sequence of integer quantum Hall\nfeatures [2, 3]. Graphene is the first truly 2D system available for investigation by solid\nstate physicists. The unusual sequence of integer quantum Hall features is related to\nthe quasi-relativistic nature of the charge carriers due to the particular graphene band\nstructure near the Dirac point [4]. In graphene the conventional integer quantum Hall\nquantization for the conductivity \u03c3xy is shifted by a half integer [4, 5] due to the halffilling of the n = 0 Landau level compared to the other levels:\n1\n\u03bde2\n4e2\n\u00b1n +\n=\n.\n(1)\n\u03c3xy =\nh\n2\nh\nAt very high magnetic fields and with high quality samples more quantum Hall plateaus\nnot in the sequence of Eq.(1) have been observed [6\u201310]; these include filling factors\n\u03bd = 0, \u00b11, \u00b14 and the fractional quantum Hall effect has been also observed in suspended\ngraphene samples [11, 12] with an insulating phase in the state \u03bd = 0 [11]. These new\nplateaus cannot be understood only by using the Landau quantization and their origin\nis currently a topic under a considerable debate. Many theories attribute the origin of\nthese new plateaus to some spontaneously broken symmetry of the system driven by\nelectron-electron interactions (see Ref. [13] and references therein). Edge states could\nalso play a key role and their relevance for the dynamics in graphene [7,14\u201318] has been\ninvoked to explain a variety of magneto-transport experiments near \u03bd = 0. Different\nmeasurements have demonstrated that the longitudinal resistance may either decrease [7]\nor increase [9] at \u03bd \u223c 0 with decreasing temperature in samples that appear to be quite\nsimilar, fueling the debate concerning the existence and origin of an insulator phase\nnear the Dirac point at high magnetic fields. This insulator phase has been attributed\nto field-induced spin-density waves in non-suspended graphene samples [19]. Our data\nshows clearly a transition to an insulator phase at high magnetic fields being consistent\nwith the results by Checkelsky et al. [9] and Giesbers et al. [10] but in a rather different\nregime, away from the Dirac point.\nIn the framework of the scaling theory of the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE),\nplateau-plateau (PP) and plateau-insulator (PI) transitions are interpreted as quantum\nphase transitions with an associated universal critical exponent \u03ba. The underlying\nphysics is the Anderson localization-delocalization quantum phase transition [20]. In\nthis work we report experimental evidence for a PI transition between states at filling\nfactors \u03bd = \u22122 and \u03bd = 0. We have obtained a value for the scaling exponent equal\nto \u03ba = 0.58 \u00b1 0.03, to our knowledge, the first evidence of this exponent in a truly\n2D system. The value we found for \u03ba is very similar to the values measured for this\nexponent for the plateau-insulator transition in standard quasi two-dimensional electron\ngases (2DEGs) in InGaAs/InP and InGaAs/GaAs quantum wells (see [21\u201326] and [27]\nfor a complete review).\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\fPlateau-insulator transition in graphene\n\n3\n\n2. Sample and magnetotransport measurements\nWe have used monolayer graphene flakes obtained by peeling graphite onto a Si wafer\nwith a 300 nm SiO2 top layer. They were processed in the CT-ISOM (Central\nde Tecnolog\u0131\u0301a-Instituto de Sistemas Optoelectr\u00f3nicos y Microtecnolog\u0131\u0301a) clean-room\nfacilities, depositing 50/500\u00c5 Ti/Au contacts in a Hall-bar geometry by using e-beam\nnanolithography as can be seen in Fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1. The left image shows the sample with the Hall bar covered by PMMA resist\nbefore the deposition of the contacts while the right one the contacted sample with the\nTi/Au already deposited.\n\nWe made 12 hall-bars in different monolayer graphene flakes and we characterize\nthem by magnetotransport measurements in our laboratory in Salamanca. We selected\nthe sample S2601f4 that exhibited a high degree of homogeneity and the highest mobility.\nThe Hall mobility (\u03bc) for this sample ranges from \u03bc = 4.5 \u00d7 103 cm2 V \u22121 s\u22121 at a gate\nvoltage Vgate = 17V far away from the Dirac point to \u03bc = 1.3 \u00d7 104 cm2 V \u22121 s\u22121 at\nVgate = 5V and being 4.2 \u00d7 104 cm2 V \u22121 s\u22121 nearby the Dirac point at Vgate = 1V.\nWe have performed magneto-transport experiments in this sample up to 28 T at\nthe Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory using a 20 MW resistive magnet. On\na first approach we measured the density in a dilution fridge and the position of the\nDirac point that was found at 3.8V at T = 200mK . The carrier concentration (electron\nand hole density in 1012 cm\u22122 ) as a function of the gate voltage Vgate at B = 0 and\n4.2K is shown in Fig. 2. The gate voltage can be easily transformed into the carrier\nDirac )\nwith C/A = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 F m\u22122 in the hole\nconcentration given by n = CA (Vgate \u2212V\ne\nregime and C/A = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 F m\u22122 in the electron one (note the slight asymmetry in\nthe obtained fitting curve) where C is the capacitance of the device (C \u223c 0.02pF ) and\nA its area (A = 107\u03bcm2 ).\nThe sample was then annealed 90 minutes in a low pressure He exchange gas\natmosphere at 100 o C in-situ prior to insertion into the 4 He cryostat. We have observed\na displacement of the Dirac point to \u22123V (see Fig.3(b) becoming it slightly narrower.\nFour probe measurements were carried out using standard ac lock-in techniques with\nexcitation currents of 1 \u2212 10 nA and frequencies of 1.3 \u2212 13 Hz.\n\n\f4\n\nPlateau-insulator transition in graphene\n\n3.0\n\n-2\n\ncm )\n\n2.5\n\nDensity (10\n\n12\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n-12 -10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nVg (V)\n\nFigure 2.

(b) Rxx and Rxy\nat B = 0T as a function of gate voltage, the Dirac point is centered at VDirac = \u22123 V.\nThe interpolated density of carriers measured at 4.2K via the Hall slope (in 1011 cm\u22122 )\nis also showed for clarity\n\n3. Results and discussion\nIn figure 3 (a) the variation of the Hall (Rxy ) and longitudinal resistance (Rxx ) as a\nfunction of the magnetic field are showed. The temperature was 4.2 K and the gate\nvoltage Vgate = \u221220 V. In such a configuration we had the Fermi energy far away from\nthe Dirac point with several Landau levels below it. At this gate voltage and keeping the\ntemperature constant at 4.2K we extracted the hole density from the Hall measurements,\nbeing n2D = 1.4 \u00d7 1012 cm\u22122 with \u03bc = 4.5 \u00d7 103 cm2 V \u22121 s\u22121 . The Hall resistance displays\nplateaus with the expected sequence for single-layer graphene in accordance with Eq.\n\n\f5\n\nPlateau-insulator transition in graphene\n\n(1). Figure 3 (b) shows Rxx , and Rxy as a function of the gate voltage without applying\nan external magnetic field . Rxy at B=0 shows a peak close to the Dirac point because\nRxx is much larger than Rxy and even with a small Hall-contact misalignment Rxx\ncontribution is dominant. The Dirac point is centered at VDirac = \u22123 V remaining\ninvariable in the following measurements showed in this paper. The interpolated density\nof carriers (obtained at 4.2K using the same technique as in Fig. 2) is shown to extract\neasily its value compared with the position of the Dirac point.\n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-3\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n27\n\n28\n\n+B\n\nB (T)\n\n0.5\n\nR\n\n-0.5\n\nxy\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\nR\n\nxx\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-1.5\n\nxx\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n1.0\n\nxy\n\n-2\n\n-1.0\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\nV\n\n(V)\n\ngate\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n-B\n\n(a)\n\n-0.5\n\nB\n\nxx\n\n4\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n2\n/h)\n\n26\n\n3\n\n2\n\n25\n\nc\n\n(e\n\n24\n\n-1.0\n\nB\n\n(e /h)\n\n23\n\n-2.0\n\nxy\n\n(-B)\n\nxy\n\n2\n\n-R\n\n1\n\n4.2K\nxy\n\n(h/e )\n\n0\n\n3K\n\n4.2K\n\na\n\nxy\n\nxx\n\nR\n\nR\n\nxy\n\n1.0\n\n2\n\n(h/e )\n\nR\n\nxy\n\n-1\n\n-2.5\n\n-1.5\n\n3K\n\n(+B)\n\nxy\n\nR\n\n(h/e )\n\n2K\nR\n\n(e /h)\n\n-2\n\n1.5\n\n2K\n\n(b)\n\n1.4K\n\nxx\n\n2.0\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\nB (T)\n\n20\n\n24\n\n0.5\n28\n\nc\n\n-0.0\n\n0.0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nB (T)\n\nFigure 4.

In the inset\nand \u2212B in solid lines and Rxy\nof (b) we show the longitudinal \u03c3xx and Hall \u03c3xy conductivities as a function of the\ngate voltage at B = 24 T and 4.2 K. \u03c3xx show a double peak structure, indicating the\nsplitting of the fourfold degeneracy. Meanwhile, the Hall conductivity shows a central\nplateau on which \u03c3xy = 0, with two lateral plateaus corresponding to \u03c3xy = \u00b12e2 /h.\n\nThen we moved the gate voltage to Vgate = \u22128 V, close enough to the Dirac point\nto have only the lowest Landau level (\u03bd = \u22122) below the Fermi energy. Applying\na magnetic field above 15T we observed a transition to a new quantum Hall plateau\n(\u03bd = 0) not in the sequence of Eq.(1) as previously observed by other groups [6\u20139].\nWe focused our study to the temperature dependence of this transition. In Fig. 4(a)\nwe show Rxx and Rxy and in Figure 4(b) the conductivities \u03c3xx and \u03c3xy (longitudinal\nand Hall) as a function of the magnetic field from 1.4 to 4.2 K, with Vgate = \u22128 V.\nThe hole density was n = 4.1 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22122 and the mobility \u03bc = 1.3 \u00d7 104 cm2 V \u22121 s\u22121 .\nWe observed a transition from the \u03bd = \u22122 to \u03bd = 0 state. The longitudinal resistance\ngrown exponentially and appeared to exhibit a temperature independent critical field at\nBc = 16.7 T. The Hall resistance has also a a temperature independent critical point at\nBc = 16.7 T and tended to the expected quantized value \u03bd = 0 reaching it at B > 18T\nfor at least 5T. Unfortunately, the diverging behavior of Rxx seriously hindered the\ndetermination of the Hall resistance Rxy , as even a small Hall-contact misalignment\n\n\fPlateau-insulator transition in graphene\n\n6\n\nwould result as the dominant contribution from Rxx . The traditional way to overcome\nthis problem is by using the B symmetry of the resistance components: Rxx is expected\nto be symmetric when applying external B, while Rxy to be anti-symmetric [22]. The\ncorrected Rxy is obtained, by an anti-symmetrization of the measured Rxy (+B) and\na\n\u2212Rxy (\u2212B): Rxy\n= [ 21 (Rxy (+B)\u2212Rxy (\u2212B))] measuring with reversed external magnetic\nfield configurations (+B) and (\u2212B) (both perpendicular to the 2DEG, being (+B) the\nstandard configuration we have used in the work and (-B) the reversed magnetic field\nconfiguration, see the inset in Figure 4 for clarity). In practice, because the admixture\nis a result of both a misalignment of contacts and a nonuniform current distribution in\nthe sample, Rxx itself is not entirely B-symmetric, limiting the accuracy to which Rxy\ncan be determined. Nevertheless, the corrected Hall resistance remained quantized deep\ninto the insulating phase.\nOur observations are likely to be understandable in terms of the usual picture for\nQH PI transitions. In a somewhat simplified picture of the standard QHE in 2DEGs,\nthe transitions between plateaus take place at \u03bd = 32 , 25 , 27 , etc. A special case is the\ntransition from the last Hall plateau at \u03bd = 1 that occurs at \u03bd = 21 where the 2DEG,\ninstead of undergoing a transition between two plateaus, becomes an insulator. In the\ncase of the PI transition in graphene from \u03bd = \u22122 to \u03bd = 0 the expected filling factor\nat the transition is \u03bd = \u22121, almost the same that we have obtained in our experiment\n\u03bd(Bc ) = \u22121.015 confirming our interpretation of this transition.\nIn this study of the PI transition we kept constant the carrier density (constant gate\npotential) then tuning 1/B was equivalent to tune the filling factor. The experimental\ncharacterization of quantum Hall plateau-plateau and plateau-insulator quantum phase\ntransitions relies on the behavior of the system as a function of T for magnetic fields\nsufficiently close to a transition point. In the vicinity of this transition point the\nlongitudinal resistance is expected to follow the empirical law [21, 26]:\nRxx = exp[\u2212\u2206\u03bd/\u03bd0 (T )] ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u2206\u03bd = 1/B \u2212 1/Bc (\u03bd here should not be confused with the Landau level filling\nfactor) and Bc is the temperature independent critical field set as 16.7 T as said before\n[left inset in Fig. (5)]. Fitting to Eq. (2) the experimental Rxx measured at four different\ntemperatures we can obtain the associated critical exponent \u03ba:\u03bd0 \u221d T \u03ba .\nThis approach has been used to study the plateau-insulator transition in a great\nvariety of quasi 2D systems. The seminal magneto-transport experiments of Tsui et\nal. [20] in InGaAs/InP samples found a value for \u03ba of 0.42 in PP transitions. For a PI\ntransition, although there remained some controversy, after two decades of experiments\nthe most commonly measured value is \u03ba = 0.57. This value has been found for a vast\nrange of samples and materials, in agreement also with numerical simulations [21\u201327]\nIn Fig. 5 we plot Rxx as a function of \u2206\u03bd. We have not drawn possible maximumminimum lines that can be extracted from upper and lower-bound values because it\nwill reflect the strenght of the white noise, observed in magnetotransport experiments\nat very high magnetic fields (see [10] as an example).We have fitted our data to the\n\n\fPlateau-insulator transition in graphene\n\n7\n\nFigure 5. Longitudinal resistance (Rxx ) as a function of \u2206\u03bd with \u2206\u03bd = 1/B - 1/Bc\nand Bc = 16.7 T at four different temperatures. In the lower inset we show log(Rxx )\nas a function of B. Using the standard scaling procedure we obtain \u03bd0 by fitting our\ndata to Eq.(2) and the results are plotted in the upper inset. We obtain a critical\nexponent \u03ba = 0.58 \u00b1 0.03.\n\nempirical law (2) with a typical least squares fit, and the goodness of single fit was\ntestified by the fact that R2 was about 0.97. We noted that the linear fit reproduces the\nbehavior of the longitudinal resistance, and this indicates that the noise do not affect\ntoo much to the least squares accuracy. From these fits we obtained \u03bd0 that are plotted\nin the right inset of Fig. 5 as a function of T. The exponent \u03ba was then obtained from\n\u03bd0 \u221d T \u03ba being the best fit \u03ba = 0.58 \u00b1 0.03 (with R2 = 0.99). To obtain the overall\nincertitude we introduced the error of each single fit and temperature stability (10mK).\nWe firmly believe that this is a clear evidence of the existence of a quantum Hall\ninsulator in graphene in the \u03bd = 0 state away enough from the Dirac point and that\nthe transition from the last quantum Hall liquid (\u03bd = \u00b12) is the same (i.e belongs to\nthe same universality class) as the well-known PI transition in conventional quasi 2D\nsystems.\nPrevious experiments in the zero-energy state in graphene in the presence of high\nmagnetic fields were focused on the dependence with the gate voltage [7\u20139] (then for\na fixed magnetic field) and close to the Dirac point. We observed that using magnetic\nfield as the driving parameter rather than the gate voltage we can obtain a more reliable\ntemperature independent critical point. In previous studies the \u03bd = 0 quantum Hall\nstate does not show a clear plateau in Rxy , being only visible as a plateau in the Hall\nconductance [8, 9]. Our measurements, although fluctuating, show a plateau in the Hall\nresistance at \u03bd = 0. As we discuss above, the diverging behavior of the Hall resistance for\nmagnetic fields above 24 T (see Fig. 4) is most likely due to Hall-contact misalignment.\nUnfortunately our cryostat allowed us a small range of temperatures that should be\nenlarged in future experiments. On the other hand, as it has been seen in previous\nexperiments close to the Dirac point, the measurements shown large fluctuations and\n\n\fPlateau-insulator transition in graphene\n\n8\n\nthe nature of this behavior is not clearly understood [9]. Of course we checked our\nresults and in particularly our fittings are stable and reproducible and that our main\nresults are not affected by these fluctuations.\nCheckelsky et al. reported temperature dependent transport measurements [9]\nwhere Rxx exhibits a magnetic field-induced crossover to a state with a very large\nresistance, as in our measurements. However, they observed that for a fixed magnetic\nfield the resistance was almost temperature independent below 2 K. This behavior,\nwhich appears to exclude a PI transition, was interpreted in terms of the symmetry\nbreaking effect of the disorder potential which may favor long-range order at finite\ntemperature with a Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition [9,28]. In their case, the applied\nvoltage was set extremely close to the Dirac point or even on it while in our case was\n5V away from it (note the big difference in terms of carrier density and mobility). They\nalso observed how the divergence of Rxx was shifted to higher fields when the Dirac\npoint moved away from Vg = 0V noting that it was important to choose samples with\n|Vg | < 1V to investigate the intrinsic properties of the Dirac point, that is not our\nscenario.\nWe want to stress that our results are not in contradiction with the KT-like\ntransition but rather probes a different regime. Away from the Dirac point, hence,\nwhen the magnetic field is varied in its strong regime (above 10T the Zeeman splitting\nseems to be strong enough) the Fermi level is tuned through the first (spin-resolved)\nLandau level. Then the features reported in this work can be easily understood in term\nof a transition dominated by percolation of the extended state.\nThe transition to an insulator reported in Ref. [9] occurs when the doping is set\nexactly at the Dirac point. Then, regardless of how strong B is (as long as the spin is\nresolved), the Fermi level in the bulk is always precisely in the middle of the Zeeman gap.\nDue to particle-hole symmetry, the filling factor as well \u03c3xy and Rxy vanish to 0. In this\nsituation, the only gapless states that can in principle give rise to non-trivial dissipative\ntransport are the \"helical\" edge states discussed recently by Shimshoni et al. [18]. In\naddition, we do not observe any trace of saturation over the range of temperatures\ninvestigated as in previous references [9]. Nevertheless, we would like to stress that a\ntemperature independent resistance has been observed in several experimental studies\nof PI quantum phase transitions. Shahar et al. [21] reported for the first time this type\nof behavior in a number of different 2D systems and although is not well understood it is\nusually related to some kind of long-range interactions [26] or to finite size effects [29].\nIn fact, finite size effects can be of particular relevance here due to the small size of\ngraphene samples. Also, the observed fluctuations in the measurements of Rxx and Rxy\npointed out in our data could be at least partially related to mesoscopic effects [30].\nWe therefore conclude that our data shows clearly a PI transition from \u03bd = \u22122 to\n\u03bd = 0 most likely due to the presence of Anderson localized states. We stress, however,\nthat this do not exclude that such a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition could exist for higher\nmagnetic fields or when the doping was precisely set at the Dirac point being probable\nthat both scenarios could coexist.\n\n\fPlateau-insulator transition in graphene\n\n9\n\n4. Summary and conclusions\nSummarizing, we have studied the quantum Hall effect in graphene and in particular\nthe \u03bd = \u22122 to \u03bd = 0 transition. We observed a PI transition when the magnetic field\nis tuned across a critical field Bc = 16.7 T. Both the Hall conductivity and the Hall\nresistance remain quantized deep into the insulating phase suggesting that we are in\nthe quantized Hall insulator regime, the same that was observed for the PI transition in\nlow mobility 2D systems. Using the standard scaling theory analysis we have obtained\nthe critical exponent for this transition \u03ba = 0.58 \u00b1 0.03, in agreement with the common\nvalue observed for this exponent in conventional 2D systems. This evidences support\nthe identification of \u03bd = 0 in graphene as an insulating phase rather than a Quantum\nHall state. To our knowledge this is the first measurement of this exponent in graphene\nand therefore the first measurement in a truly 2D system. Therefore two distinct PI\ntransitions exist near the Dirac point in graphene, namely a conventional QH-insulator\ntransition as the observed in our experiment and the recently observed KosterlitzThouless transition by Checkelsky et al. [9]. Further studies at lower temperatures and\nhigher magnetic fields are needed to confirm our results in a larger range of temperatures\nand magnetic fields, and in particular to try to find the conditions where both transitions\ncould be observed at the same time.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to J.
