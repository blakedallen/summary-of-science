It provides insight into multivariate (equivalently multidimensional) problems and lead to several applications. The approach of Parallel\nCoordinates (abbr. k-coords) [5] is in the spirit of Descartes, based on a\ncoordinate system but differing in an important way as shown in Fig 1. On\nthe Euclidean plane R2 (more precisely on the projective plane P2 ) with\nxy-Cartesian coordinates, n copies of a real line, labelled X\u03041 , X\u03042 , . . . , X\u0304n ,\nare placed equidistant and perpendicular to the x-axis with X\u03041 and y being coincident. These lines, which have the same orientation as the y-axis,\nare the axes of the Parallel Coordinate system for the n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn . A point C = (c1 , c2 , . . . , cn ) \u2208 Rn is represented by the\npolygonal line C\u0304 having vertices at the values ci on the Xi -axes. In this\nway a one-to-one correspondence is established between a points in Rn and\nplanar polygonal lines with vertices on the parallel axes. The polygonal line\nC\u0304 contains the complete lines and not just the segments between adjacent\naxes.\nThe restriction to R2 provides that not only is a point represented by\n\ny\n\nc1\n\nci\n\n...\n\nc1\n\nci-\n\ncn\n\n...\n\n1\n\nci+\n\n1\n\ncn-\n\ncn-\n\nc2\nX1\n\nX1\n\nX2\n\nx\n2\n\nX i-1 X i\n\nX i+1\n\n1\n\nX n-2 X n-1 X n\n\nFigure 1: A point C = (c1 , c2 , . . . , cn ) \u2208 Rn is represented by the polygonal\nline C\u0304 (consist of n \u2212 1 sections) with vertices at the ci values of the X\u0304i axis\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , n.\n\n2\n\n\fa line, but that a line is represented by a point. The points on a line are\nrepresented by a collection of lines intersect at a single point as can be seen\nin Fig. 2; i.e. a \"pencil\" of lines in the language of Projective Geometry.\nA fundamental point \u2194 line duality is induced which is the cornerstone\nof deeper results in k-coords. The multidimensional generalizations for the\nrepresentation of linear p-flats in Rn (i.e. planes of dimension 1 \u2264 p \u2264 n\u22121),\nin terms of indexed points have been obtained. The proper setting for dualities is the projective P2 rather than the Euclidean plane R2 . A review of\nthe mathematical foundations is available in [6].\ny\n\nx2\n\nll\n\nx1\n\nx\n\nl\n\nX1\n\nX2\n\nFigure 2: Fundamental point \u2194 line duality.\nFor non-linear, especially non-convex, objects the representation is naturally more complex. In R2 a point-curve, a curve considered as collection\nof points, is transformed into a line-curve; a curve prescribed by it's tangent\nlines as in Fig. 3. The line-curve's envelope, a point-curve, is the curve's\nimage in k-coords. In many cases this yields an image that is difficult to discern. This point requires elaboration in order to motivate and understand\nsome of the development presented here. As posed, the construction of a\ncurve's image involves the sequence of operations:\npoint \u2212 curve \u2192 line \u2212 curve\n7\u2212\u2192\npoint \u2212 curve (as the envelope of line \u2212 curve).\nUnlike the example shown in Fig. 3, where the line-curve's image is clear,\nthe plethora of overlapping lines obscures parts of the resulting curve-line.\nThis is a manifestation of what is sometimes called \"over-plotting\" problem\n3\n\n\fy\n\nx2\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\n\nx1\n\nx\n\nX1\n\nX2\n\nFigure 3: Point-curve mapped into line-curve (envelope of lines).\nin k-coords; the abundance of \"ink\" in the picture covers many underlying\npatterns. Simply our eyes are not capable of \"extracting\" the envelope of\nlots of overlapping lines. There are also computational difficulties involved\nin the direct computation of the image curve's envelope. In a way this is\nthe \"heart\" of the \"over-plotting\" problem considered as a barrier in the\neffective use of k-coords. This problem can be overcome by skipping the\nintermediate step and go to an equivalent\npoint \u2212 curve 7\u2212\u2192 point \u2212 curve\ntransformation which provides directly a clear image. as shown in Fig. 5.\nThis point-to-point mapping (Inselberg Transformation [5] ) preserves\nthe curve's continuity properties. The idea is to use the \u2192 part of the\nduality and map the tangents of the curve into points as illustrated in Fig.\n5. Therefore, a curve is represented by a point-curve (the \"dual curve\") in\nthe k-coords plane. For a point-curve, \u03b3, defined implicitly by\n\u03b3 : f (x1 , x2 ) = 0.\nthe x, y coordinates of the point-curve image (i.e. dual) \u03b3\u0304 are given by\n\uf8f1\n\u2202f /\u2202x2\n\uf8f2 x =\n(\u2202f /\u2202x1 +\u2202f /\u2202x2 ) ,\n\uf8f3 y =\n\n(x1 \u2202f /\u2202x1 +x2 \u2202f /\u2202x2 )\n(\u2202f /\u2202x1 +\u2202f /\u2202x2 ) .\n\n4\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\f\u03b3\n\nP\n\nP\n\n\u03b3\n\nFigure 4: In line-curve (on the left) the tangents cover the image shown on\nthe right as a point-curve.\n\nIt was shown by B. Dimsdale [1] and generalized in [5], using this transformation that conics are mapped into conics in 6 different ways [1]. Here we\ndevelop the extension of the dual image for the family of general algebraic\ncurves. This family of curves is highly significant in many implementations\nand applications, since these curves can easily and uniquely be reconstructed\nfrom a finite collection of their points (for instance using simple interpolation\nmethods [7], [13]). Approximations of such curves can simply be obtained\nusing similar methods.\nAs will be seen, the dual of an algebraic curve in general has degree\nhigher than the original curve. There are some fringe-benefits, illustrated\nlater, where \"special-points\" such as self-intersections or inflection-points\nwhich are conveniently transformed. But we do not want to get ahead of\nourselves. The key reason for this effort is to pave the way for the representation of algebraic curves and more general hyper-surfaces, as well as their\napproximations, in terms of planar regions without losing information. To\npursue this goal then we need firstly to study the image of curves starting\nwith general algebraic curves.\n\n5\n\n\fy\n\nx2\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3\n\nx1\n\nx\n\nX1\n\nX2\n\nFigure 5: Point-curve mapped into point-curve.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nTransforms of Algebraic Curves\nThe Idea Leading to the Algorithm\n\nIn order to represent non-linear relations in k-coords it is essential to extend\nthe representational results first to algebraic curves; those described by either, explicitly or implicitly by irreducible polynomials of arbitrary degree.\nThe direct application of eq. (2) turns out to be difficult even for degree\n3. There is a splendid way to solve this problem using some ideas and tools\nfrom Algebraic Geometry. These involve properties of homogeneous polynomials and Resultant which are explained during the development of the\nmethod. For extensive treatments the reader is referred to [8], [10], [11] and\n[12].\nStarting with an algebraic curve \u03b3 defined by an irreducible polynomial\nf (x1 , x2 ) = 0 in R2 its image in k-coords is sought. A number of preparatory steps smooth the way for the easier application of the transformations\nin eq. (2). First the curve \u03b3 \u2282 R2 is \"raised\" to a surface embedded in the\nprojective space P2 and only then the corresponding mapping into k-coords\nis applied.\nStep 1 : There exists a one-to-one correspondence (preserving the reducibility of polynomials) between any polynomial f (x1 , x2 ) = 0 of degree n\nand a homogenous polynomial in the projective plane P2 , which is\n6\n\n\fobtained by using homogeneous coordinates. Specifically,\n\u2022 replace xk by\n\nxk\nx3\n\nfor k = 1, 2,\n\n\u2022 multiply the whole polynomial by x3 n and simplify.\nThese multiplications are, of course, allowable for x3 6= 0. The result\nis a homogeneous polynomial (which is also irreducible if f = 0 is)\nwith each term having degree n. To wit,\nf (x1 , x2 ) =\n\nn\nX\n\naij xi1 xj2 \u2192\n\ni+j=0\n\nF (x1 , x2 , x3 ) =\n\nn\nX\n\naij xi1 xj2 xn\u2212i\u2212j\n,\n3\n\n(3)\n\ni+j=0\n\nwhich describes a surface in P2 where the original polynomial curve is\nembedded as:\nf (x1 , x2 ) = F (x1 , x2 , 1).\n(4)\n\nStep 2 : The Gradient of F is found and denoted by :\n\u2207F (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (\n\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\n,\n,\n) = (\u03b7, \u03be, \u03c8).\n\u2202x1 \u2202x2 \u2202x3\n\nThe three derivatives provide the direction numbers of the normal\nto the tangent plane at the point (x1 , x2 , x3 ) . It is a fundamental\nproperty of homogeneous polynomials that\nx1\n\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\n+ x2\n+ x3\n= nF\n\u2202x1\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x3\n\n(5)\n\nwhere n is the degree of F . In our case F = 0 and hence the equation\nof the tangent planes is\n\u03b7x1 + \u03bex2 + \u03c8x3 = 0.\n\n(6)\n\nSince the tangent plane at any point of the surface goes through the\norigin it is clear that the surface F is a cone with apex at the origin\nas shown in Fig. 6.\n\n7\n\n\f2\n\nx3\n\nP( R )\n\nF ( x1 , x2 , x3 )\n\n: x3 = 1\n\nf ( x1 , x2 )\n\nx2\nx1\n\nFigure 6: Cone F (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = 0 generated by embedding the curve\nf (x1 , x2 ) = 0 in P2 .\nStep 3 : Substituting for x3 from eq. (6) in\nF (x1 , x2 , \u2212(\n\n\u03b7x1 + \u03bex2\n)) = 0.\n\u03c8\n\n(7)\n\nprovides the intersection of the tangent plane with the cone which is\na whole line as shown in Fig. 7. Each one of these lines, of course,\ngoes through the origin and therefore it can be described by any one\nother of its points and in particular by (x1 , x2 , 1).

Alternatively, the cone can be considered as\nbeing generated by a line, the generating line \u2013 see Fig. 8, pivoted at\nthe origin and moving continuously along each point (x1 , x2 , 1) of the\ncurve described by eq. (4). On each one of these lines the direction\nnumbers (\u03b7, \u03be, \u03c8) are unique and constant as shown in Fig. 8; i.e. there\nis a one-to-one correspondence:\n(x1 , x2 , 1) \u2194 (\u03b7, \u03be, \u03c8).\nEq. (7), and hence it's rephrasing eq. (8), contains two equivalent\ndescriptions of the cone, i.e. in terms of the coordinates (x1 , x2 , 1) and\nalso the direction numbers (\u03b7, \u03be, \u03c8).

Apparently the maximal degree is attained by the image\ncurve in the absence of singularities in the function or it's derivatives. The\nfull conditions relating the image's degree to less then the maximal are not\nknown at this stage. Two such examples are shown in the subsequent figures,\nFig. 11 and Fig. 12.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nConsider the class S of hyper-surfaces in Rn which are the envelopes of their\ntangent hyper-planes. As mentioned earlier [6] hyper-planes can be repre17\n\n\fx2\n\n\u03b3\n\ny\n\n\u03b3\n\nx1\n\nx\n\nX1\n\nX2\n\nFigure 12: x21 x2 \u2212 1 = 0 7\u2212\u2192 4y 3 + 27x3 \u2212 27x2 = 0.\nsented in k-coords by n \u2212 1 indexed points. Hence for a hyper-surface \u03c3 \u2208 S\neach point P \u2208 \u03c3 maps into n \u2212 1 indexed planar points. From this it follows that the hyper-surface \u03c3 can be mapped (i.e. represented) by n \u2212 1\nindexed planar regions \u03c3\u0304i composed of these points. Restricted classes of\nhyper-surfaces have been represented in this way and it turns out that the\n\u03c3\u0304i reveal non-trivial properties of the corresponding hyper-surface \u03c3. It has\nalready been proved that for any dimension Quadrics (algebraic surfaces\nof degree 2) are mapped into planar regions whose boundaries are conics\n[4]. This also includes non-convex surfaces like the \"saddle\". There are\nstrong evidence supporting the conjecture that algebraic surfaces in general\nmap into planar regions bounded by algebraic curves. This, besides their\nsignificance on their own right, is one of the reasons for studying the representation of algebraic curves. In [2] families of approximate planes and\nflats are beautifully and usefully represented in k-coords. Our results cast\nthe foundations not only for the representation of hyper-surfaces in the class\n(S), but also their approximations in terms of planar curved regions.\n\nAcknowledgments\nT he author would like to thank to Prof. Alfred Inselberg for his grate help\nand his kindly support.
