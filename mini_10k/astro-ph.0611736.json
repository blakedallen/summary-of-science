Introduction\nThe stellar evolution models predict the Galactic population of\ncompact objects - neutron stars and black holes - numbers somewhere between 107 and 109 objects. Most of them are solitary\nand only a small fraction resides in binaries. A small fraction\nof solitary neutron stars is visible as radio pulsars. Some black\nholes in binaries are actively accreting and are observable mainly\nas X-ray transients, however most of the black hole population\nhas not been yet seen. The properties of black holes population\nin our galaxy depend on the history of star formation rate, evolution of metallicity and on the initial mass function and on details\nof compact object formation in supernovae explosions.\nThe properties of the population of solitary black holes\ncan only be investigated indirectly, through observations of\ntheir interaction with the interstellar matter or light emitted by\nstars. Solitary black holes should be accreting gas from the\nISM. Therefore some of them should be observable in X-rays\n(Agol & Kamionkowski 2002; Beskin & Karpov 2005). The luminosity in X-rays shall on one hand be smaller than for solitary\nneutron stars where the surface emission plays a significant role,\nbut on the other hand it may be increased due to smaller velocities and higher mass of black holes in comparison with neutron\nstars. The searches for such objects have not been successful yet.\nSolitary black holes are also detectable with current microlensing searches(Paczynski 2003) like OGLE (Udalski 2003)\nand MOA (Bond et al. 2001). These campaigns have already\nyielded several candidate black holes detections. Bennett et al.\n(2002) has presented two events: MACHO-96-BLG-5 and\nMACHO-98-BLG-6, with the mass estimates 6+10\n\u22123 M\u2299 and\n+7\n6\u22123 M\u2299 respectively. Mao et al. (2002) showed that OGLE-1999BUL-32 identified also as MACHO-96-BLG-22 is a black\nSend offprint requests to: T. Bulik, e-mail: tb@astrouw.edu.pl\n\nhole candidate with the minimum mass of 10.5M\u2299 . A further\nsearch for X-rays from MACHO-96-BLG-5 (Maeda et al. 2005)\nyielded an upper limit corresponding to the luminosity of less\nthan (8 \u2212 9) \u00d7 10\u221210 LEdd . A recent likelihood analysis of 22\nmicrolensing events Poindexter et al. (2005) lead to confirmation of the black hole candidate MACHO-99-BLG-22, while the\nother candidates are less probable.\nThe sample of the microlensing compact objects and black\nhole candidates will increase with time. It is therefore interesting\nto see what constraints can be imposed on the models of black\nhole formation and evolution by these observations. In this paper we present a simulation of the stellar evolution leading to\nproduction of solitary black holes in our galaxy. We analyze two\nscenarios: the single stellar evolution and the fromation of solitary black holes through disruption of binaries. We then analyze\nthe motion of black holes in the galactic potential and search for\npossible microlensing observable from the Earth.\nIn section 2 we present the basic ingredients of the calculation: the stellar evolution model, the galactic potential and mass\ndistribution used, and the lensing search algorithm. Section 3\ncontains the results and section 4 the discussion.\n\n2. Description of the model\n2.1. Compact object formation\n\nThe single star evolution is modeled using the formulae of\nHurley et al. (2000) and we use the StarTrack population synthesis code (Belczynski et al. 2002a) for modelling binary evolution. The StarTrack population synthesis code was initially\ndeveloped for the study of double compact object mergers in\nthe context of GRB progenitors (Belczynski et al. 2002a) and\ngravitational-wave inspiral sources (Belczynski et al. 2002b). In\nrecent years StarTrack has undergone major updates and re-\n\n\f2\n\nS. Os\u0142owski et al.: Gravitational Lensing ...\n\nTable 1.

The new version has already been tested against observations and detailed evolutionary calculations (Belczynski et al.\n2006), and has been used in various applications. The most\nimportant updates for compact object formation and evolution\ninclude: a full numerical approach to binary evolution due to\ntidal interactions and coupling calibrated using high mass Xray binaries and open cluster observations, a detailed treatment\nof mass transfer episodes fully calibrated against detailed calculations with a stellar evolution code, updated stellar winds\nfor massive stars, and the latest determination of natal kick\nvelocity distribution for neutron stars (Hobbs et al. 2005). For\ndisrupted (by supernova explosion) binaries we follow trajectories of components as described in Belczynski et al. (2006).\nIn the helium star evolution, which is of a crucial importance\nfor the formation of new classes of double compact objects,\ne.g., Ivanova et al. (2003), we have applied a conservative treatment matching closely the results of detailed evolutionary calculations. The NS-NS progenitors are followed and checked\nfor any potential Roche lobe overflow (RLOF). While in the\nmass transfer phase, systems are examined for potential development of dynamical instability, in which case the systems are\nevolved through a common envelope phase. We treat common\nenvelope events through the energy formalism (Webbink 1984;\nBelczynski et al. 2002b), where the binding energy of the envelope is determined from the set of He star models calculated\nwith the detailed evolutionary code by Ivanova et al. (2003). For\nsome systems we observe, as before, extra orbital decay leading to the formation of very tight short lived double compact\nobject binaries. However, since the progenitor evolution and the\nfinal RLOF episodes are now followed in much greater detail,\nwe note significant differences from our earlier studies. For a\ndetailed description of the revised code we refer the reader to\nBelczynski et al. (2006).\nThe simplest scenario leading to a single compact object is\nthrough evolution of single stars. In this case we put the newly\nformed star in the galactic disc with its velocity drawn from an\nappropriate distribution after the supernova event.\nAn important additional scenario follows a disruption of a\nbinary as a result of a first supernova explosion. A large fraction of binaries containing massive stars is disrupted in this way.\nThis leads to a formation of a single compact object and a single companion which may still be massive enough to produce\nanother compact object. We assume that the first supernova explosion takes place in the galactic disk. We follow the motion of\nthe single star until it produces another compact object.\nA much smaller contribution comes from the disruption of a\nbinary during the second supernova explosion. In this case two\nsingle compact objects are formed. We follow the motion of the\nsystem after the first supernova until the second one. Thus the\nnewly formed single compact objects start at the actual location\nof the second supernova with appropriate velocities.\n\nFinally, we also investigate black hole formation through\nmergers. This includes mergers of stars during their nuclear evolution, as well as mergers of a compact object with a massive\ncompanion as a result of binary interaction. In the first case we\nassume that a single star is formed with the mass equal to the\nsum of the masses of the two merging components and we evolve\nthis star neglecting the potential changes in metallicity. In the\nlatter case we assume that a single black hole is formed with\nthe mass equal to the sum of the masses of the compact object\nand the core of the companion while the envelope is expelled.\nThe newly formed black holes do not gain additional velocities\nduring mergers.\nWe ignore the contribution of double black hole systems, and\nsingle black holes formed in mergers of double black holes as\nthey represent a much smaller population than the ones mentioned above.\nWe consider several models of binary evolution to asses the\nsensitivity of the results. We decrease the strength of the stellar winds which affects mainly the masses of the newly formed\ncompact objects (model W05). A second parameter that may influence the results significantly is the distribution of the kicks received by the newly formed compact object. Apart from the standard model in which the value of the kick is decreased with increasing fall-back mass, we consider two extreme cases: in first\nblack holes receive no kicks at all (model K0), and in the second\none kick distribution regardless of their mass is the same as for\nneutron stars (model K1). Finally in model C we allow for the\ncommon envelope evolution initiated by stars passing through\nthe Hertzsprung gap.\nThe list of the models considered is shown in Table 1.\n2.2. Galactic model\n\nWe consider a model of the Galaxy consisting of three components: bulge, disk, and halo. The bulge and disk potential\nare described by the Miyamoto & Nagai (1975) type potential\n(Paczynski 1990; Bulik et al. 1999)\nGM\n\u03a6(r, z) = q\n,\n\u221a\n2\n2\n2\n2\nR + (a + z + b )\n\n(1)\n\np\nwhere M is the mass of a given component, R = x2 + y2 , and\na, B are the parameters. The halo is described by the density distribution \u03c1 = \u03c1c [1 + (r/rc )2 ]\u22121 with a cutoff at rcut = 100 kpc\nabove which the halo density is zero. The corresponding potential for r < rcut is\n!\n\"\n!#\nGMh 1\nrc\nr2\nr\n\u03a6(r) = \u2212\n(2)\nln 1 + 2 + arctan\nrc 2\nrc\nr\nrc\nWe use the following values of the parameters\n(Blaes & Rajagopal\n1991)\ndescribing\nthe\npotential:\na1 = 0 kpc, b1 = 0.277 kpc, a2 = 4.2 kpc, b2 = 0.198 kpc,\nM1 = 1.12\u00d71010 M\u2299 , M2 = 8.78\u00d71010 M\u2299 , Mh = 5.0\u00d71010 M\u2299 ,\nand rc = 6.0 kpc.\nThe distribution of stars in the disk is assumed to be that of\na young disc (Paczynski 1990). The radial and vertical distributions are independent i.e. the distributions factor out:\nP(R, z) \u221d R(R)dR p(z)dz ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the radial distribution is p(R) \u221d exp(\u2212R/Rexp ), and Rexp =\n4.5 kpc, and we introduce an upper cutoff at Rmax = 20 kpc.\u0001\nThe vertical distribution is exponential p(z) \u221d exp \u2212z/75pc\n\n\fS.

Star and the lens are located inside a sphere of radius R equal to the radius of the Earth's\norbit. Vector P denotes the position of the star in the galaxy,\nwhile D is a star-lens vector. We look for a situation when starlens line crosses the Earth's orbit during the evolution of the system.\n. This is not a self consistent approach since the matter density corresponding to the disk potential is not the same as the\nstellar density. A self consistent approach has been investigated by Bulik et al. (1998) using the potentials calculated by\nKuijken & Gilmore (1989).\n2.3. Lens search algorithm\n\nA naive search for lenses i.e. testing for events when a star and\na compact object are aligned with Earth on its galactic orbit\nwould require nearly infinite computational resources. Therefore\nwe use the following lens search algorithm. We look for the lens\nevents that take place anywhere on the galactic orbit of the Earth.\nThis is much easier computationally as this approach make use\nof the cylindrical symmetry of the Milky Way.\nWe assume that the Earth's orbit is circular with the radius\nof 8.5 kpc. Let us consider a sphere of radius R = 8.5 kpc (which\nis equal to Earth's galactic orbit radius) and centered in the center of the galaxy. Let us also consider a star-lens system located\nsomewere in the galaxy. The position of the system is characterized by two vectors: P - the position vector of the star in the\ngalaxy, and D - the star-lens vector (see Fig. 1). We search for a\npoint Q in which the line passing through the position of the star\nand the lens pierces the sphere. In principle we look for a factor\nt which satisfies the condition\n|P + t D| = R .\n\n(4)\n\nEq. (4) is a quadratic equation in t\n(P + t D) * (P + t D) = R2 ,\n\n(5)\n\nD2 t2 + 2 D * Pt + (P2 \u2212 R2 ) = 0 .\n\n(6)\n\nNow, for each pair of a star and a compact object, we calculate \u2206 taking into account their positions at the beginning and\nat the end of a calculation step. If \u2206 > 0 we calculate \u2206\u2032 from\nthe position of the pair at the end of the step, which in our calculations was one month. If it is also positive, then we calculate\n\u2032\nboth t1,2 and t1,2\n, respectively. We are only interested in a con\u2032\nfiguration for which t1,2 > 1 and t1,2\n> 1. If t < 0 the compact\nobject is located behind the star, and for 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1 the compact\nobject and the star reside on the opposite sides of the sphere. In\nboth such cases the lensing event cannot be observed on Earth.\nFor both t and t\u2032 we then calculate positions of the points where\nstar-lens line crosses the sphere at the beginning and at the end\nof the examined evolution period. The lensing event happens if\nthese points are located in different hemispheres (z\u2032 z < 0).\nThis algorithm is not sensitive to some special configurations\nwhen during the evolution star or compact object are located\noutside the sphere at very high azimuthal angles (as seen from\nEarth). We checked for these special occasions with two additional algorithms. We conclude that such events are extremely\nrare (there was not even one such case) and does not influence\nour results.\n2.4. Lensing rate\n\nIn order to estimate the true lensing rate one has to scale the\nnumber of the lensing events found in the simulation to match\nthe physical conditions in our Galaxy. There are two scaling factors involved. One results from the number of simulated stars\nand compact objects and the second from the fact that we look\nfor the lensing events that happen on the whole Earth's orbit.\nLet us denote the Earth orbital period in the Milky way as\nP = 250 Myrs.Let the true number of star in the Milky Way\n\u2217\nbe N11\n\u00d7 1011 , and flens = 10\u22122 flens,\u22122 represent the fraction\nof the stars in the galaxy that can be detected by lens search\nexperiments. and the number of compact objects in the Galaxy\nN8CO \u00d7 108 . Our simulations include 106 stars that can be lensed\nin the Galactic potential.\nThus the expected rate of lenses due to the compact objects\nis\nNlens\n\u2217\nR = 4 \u00d7 102 flens,\u22122 N11\nN8CO\n,\n(8)\nN sim\nwhere N s im is the number of compact objects (potential lenses)\nin the simulation, and Nlens is the number of lenses we find in\none year.\n\n3. Results\nUsing Startrack population synthesis code we evolved 105 binary systems, obtaining data about compact objects (neutron\nstars and black holes). We put those objects (only solitary, from\ndisrupted systems) into the model Galaxy.We also randomly introduced 106 stars in the Milky Way. All the stars were then\nevolved for 10Gy in Galactic potential taking into account the\ninitial velocities that the compact objects received at birth due to\nasymmetric kicks and disruptions of the binary systems Blaauw\n(1961). We then searched for lensing events that take place anywhere on the Earth orbit in the galaxy in one year of simulation.\n\n\f4\n\nS. Os\u0142owski et al.: Gravitational Lensing ...\n\nFig. 2.

The\ntypical values obtained are a few tens per year, however these expected rates have to be considered as rough estimates given the\nnumber of assumptions used in equation 8. Note that the Table\ngives the values of the rates assuming that all compact objects\nare formed in the particular scenario.\nIn each simulation we have noted the positions of the lensing events on the sky. We present the skymaps of these position in Figure 2. The lenses are strongly concentrated around the\ngalactic center. In Figure 3 we present the cumulative distribution of the fraction of events as a function of the distance from\nthe Galactic Center. Typically 70% of the lensing events take\nplace within \u2248 5\u25e6 from the Galactic Center, while a fraction 0.9\nof the events happens within 20\u25e6 .\nWe also note the mass of the gravitational lens for each lensing event. In Figures 4 and 5 we present the intrinsic distributions\nof masses of compact objects for each model and the mass distribution of lenses. In the case of models S, M, K0, and K1 the\ndistributions are either quite similar. They do differ in the case\nof remaining models. But if they differ then they do in the same\nmanner:the distribution of observed masses shows a deficiency\n\nFig. 4.

The distributions are\nsimilar for the models in which the velocities of compact objects\nweakly depend on their masses: K0, and K1.\nIn the cases when the distributions differ the suppresion of\nlow mass compact objects is not more than about 20% in relation\nto the high mass compact objects.\n\n\fS.

Summary\nWe have considered several scenarios leading to formation of\ngalactic compact objects and calculated their initial velocity distributions. We then simulate the spatial and velocity distributions\nof them in our Galaxy. Each model yields a different compact\nobjects mass distribution and may have a different distribution\nof velocities. We simulate the microlensing events and note both\nmass and position for each one.\nWe estimate the rates of lensing events due to compact objects. These estimates show that they can be observed. The rates\nin Table 2 must be taken as very rough estimates. There are some\npoorly known factors that are included in these rates - see equation 8. One should note that the fraction of objects detectable\nby the lens searches flens can be increased for the searches conducted in the infrared. However, we know that there already are\nsome events which can be interpreted as microlensing events by\nblack holes.\nIn the simulations the robust result is the distribution of lensing events in sky. All the events are well concentrated around\nthe Galactic center. Thus the lens searches should concentrate\non this region. This is probably due to the fact that the dominant\nfactor determining the position on the sky is the density of the\nlensed stars and not lenses themselves.\nFinally, we find that the observed mass distributions differ by\nless than 20% from the intrinsic one. The observations of several\ngravitational lenses from black holes or neutron stars should lead\nto relatively good estimate of the intrinsic compact object mass\ndistribution. The observation of the mass distribution of compact\nobjects is extremely important since this is a unique way to probe\nthe final stages of the massive stars evolution. Observations of\n\nblack holes in massive accreting binaries may suffer from numerous selection effects and probably do not reflect the underlying intrinsic distribution.\nThe lensing events due to massive lenses will have long duration and therefore require long observational campaigns. We\nemphasize the importance of such searches, as their potential\nresults will have a very significant relevance for the theory of\ncompact object formation and models of massive star evolution.\nAcknowledgements.
